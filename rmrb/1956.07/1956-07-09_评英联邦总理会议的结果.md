Commenting on the Results of the Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference
　　Hu Jin
The ten-day Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference has concluded. The conference discussed all aspects of the international situation and many issues related to the Commonwealth, and finally issued a communique expressing the hope for peace and calling for strengthening the role of the Commonwealth. Although the communique did not propose specific methods and steps in this regard, and some wording was ambiguous, it can be seen that the results of this conference have important significance for both the Commonwealth and the world situation.

According to various reports, the conference mainly discussed the new situation in international relations and important issues related to the future of the Commonwealth and the re-evaluation of the Commonwealth's position, and therefore it was called the "most important" conference since the war.

In recent years, the international situation has undergone drastic changes, the balance of power between peace and war has undergone fundamental changes, the movement for national independence has surged unprecedentedly, and peaceful coexistence and national independence have become an unstoppable trend in world politics. The Cold War, the formation of aggressive military blocs, and colonialist policies have been repeatedly frustrated, and the profound crisis of the British Empire and the Commonwealth caused by this policy has also become apparent. Therefore, the issue of the international situation, especially the relationship between East and West, occupies a dominant position on the agenda of the Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference. At the same time, this issue is closely linked to the status of the Commonwealth and its internal problems, such as "defense" and financial and economic issues, and maintaining and strengthening internal relations within the Commonwealth, which is completely understandable.

From this point of view, the communique shows that the conference expressed appropriate concern about the international tension and the scourge of the arms race, and declared that "the policy of all Commonwealth countries will at all times be aimed at maintaining and consolidating world peace," which is of positive significance. People also noted the attitude of the conference towards some major issues in the current situation. For example, the communique announced that the Commonwealth Prime Ministers "considered it important to seek a broad disarmament agreement," welcomed the Soviet government's recent measures to carry out large-scale disarmament and promote friendly relations and ties with various countries, and believed that "the gradual improvement of relations between the Soviet Union and other major powers will help eliminate the fear of war and is in the interest of world peace." At the same time, the communique mentioned that the governments of the Commonwealth countries will strive to seek solutions to outstanding international issues. The communique also "expressed the hope that the membership of the United Nations could be further expanded." The communique affirmed that the Commonwealth countries can play an important role in maintaining peace in various regions of the world and seeking solutions to outstanding international issues. These are all welcome. However, the communique unnecessarily links the reduction of the people's arms burden with the solution of outstanding international issues, which will give the "warmongering" forces an excuse to continue to pursue a policy of arms expansion and war preparation by using international disputes.

Prime Minister Eden made some relatively realistic assessments of the international situation at the Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference. He believed that this conference should be "part of a long-term process of building a bridge between the two major powers (the Soviet Union and the United States) that are dividing the world." Eden affirmed that the Commonwealth could help the United States and the Soviet Union get closer. He also raised the issue of the need to hold another "summit" meeting. Indeed, the improvement of Soviet-American relations is of the utmost importance in the current international situation. The Soviet Union has always taken the initiative in this regard and made great efforts. The problem is that some groups in the United States are still unwilling to abandon the "Cold War" policy of creating suspicion and hostility. It should be pointed out that without the support of other Western countries, this policy of the United States would be difficult to maintain. Recently, contacts between leaders of various countries have become increasingly frequent, especially the talks between the Soviet Union and Britain, and the Soviet Union and France, which have greatly enhanced the relations between major powers and many countries. It is conceivable that if Britain effectively takes action to promote understanding between East and West and plays the role of a "bridge" between the Soviet Union and the United States, it will produce positive results.

Another key to improving East-West relations lies in easing the tension in the Far East, especially in the Taiwan region. The communique stated that "they look forward to the continued easing of tension in the Taiwan region" and that "the problems in this region must be resolved peacefully." As everyone knows, the tension in the Taiwan region is entirely caused by the United States' use of force to occupy China's territory of Taiwan. The Chinese government and people do not want to fight with the United States, and are willing to peacefully resolve disputes with the United States and eliminate tension in the Taiwan region. Premier Zhou Enlai recently officially announced on behalf of our government that we are willing to peacefully liberate Taiwan through direct negotiations. However, the United States still occupies Taiwan by force and openly attempts to have its occupation of Taiwan recognized. This complicates the issue. The Chinese people welcome any goodwill and efforts that help to ease the tension in the Taiwan region, but will never allow the United States to continue to occupy China's territory of Taiwan under any pretext.

Some countries at the Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference expressed that the People's Republic of China should restore its legitimate seat in the United Nations and lift the embargo against China. These positive suggestions will also be welcomed by the Chinese people. These steps, which are conducive to easing the situation, have been widely supported by Asian, African and other countries. The Australian "Daily Telegraph" pointed out that improving trade and diplomatic relations with China is "sensible and inevitable."

The desire for maintaining and consolidating peace expressed by the Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference is another positive factor in the current international situation. Here, India, as one of the independent major powers, has played an important role. The British "Manchester Guardian" also believes that India's attitude towards world affairs is a "constructive attitude". The significance of Ceylon's policy of peaceful neutrality has also been demonstrated at the conference. The India Press Trust reported that the organizers of the meeting are "now more willing than ever before to face the realities of Asia and Africa."

Peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems is in the interest of all countries. Today's changes in the balance of international forces are conducive to coexistence and unfavorable to war plans. British leaders have pointed out the fact that no one except a madman can plan to conquer the world by force. Based on this understanding, Britain has taken preliminary measures to reduce military spending and believes that it is necessary to revise its "defense" policy. But it must also be seen that in Britain, there are people who, in the name of "atomic balance", are trying their best to defend the arms race and the policy of aggressive military blocs. In their view, it seems that reducing conventional armaments and investing more manpower and material resources in strengthening atomic armaments will be beneficial to peace. They continue to obstruct efforts to break the disarmament deadlock and advocate strengthening "defense" and maintaining aggressive military blocs. This so-called old concept of "seeking peace through strength" has nothing in common with genuine peaceful coexistence.

Prime Minister Nehru said correctly that "the best defense is friendly relations." Friendship begets friendship and will produce true security. It should also be pointed out that today, whoever has the greatest confidence in coexistence, whoever can shed the heavy burden of armaments the lightest, will be able to gain the greatest benefit in the peaceful competition. This should be deeply felt by countries that are struggling under the heavy pressure of the arms burden. Reuters reported in a telegram that the question now being raised to Commonwealth politicians is whether they can transfer more resources to the new economic struggle as the Soviet Union is already doing. This is a realistic and acute question for Britain.

The conference communique emphasized the "paramount importance" of maintaining and strengthening economic strength. Here, it is worth noting that, according to reports, the Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference discussed a plan put forward by Britain to strengthen and expand the Commonwealth so as to become a "competitive coexistence" against the Soviet Union and a "third economic force" against the invasion of American capital into the interests of the Commonwealth.

It must be pointed out that it is completely unfounded to insist that there is a so-called "infiltration of the Soviet economy" or even "the expansion of the Communist Party" resulting from it. The fact is that the Soviet Union and other socialist countries do not have monopoly capital groups, nor do they have a crisis of overproduction, and there is no need to compete with any country for markets and spheres of influence. They are only willing to selflessly support the development of independent economies in backward countries, provide these countries with financial and economic assistance that does not have any political and economic conditions attached, and actively establish and develop equal and mutually beneficial economic cooperation with these countries, and are also willing to strive to develop extensive economic and trade ties with all other countries, including the most advanced capitalist countries. Therefore, this new type of international economic cooperation does not have any exclusivity or aggressiveness, which is fundamentally different from the kind of egoistic foreign economic relations that imperialist countries have always established and are still trying to maintain.

Since it is announced to be a bridge of understanding between East and West, the "third economic force" plan has no reason to believe that the development of the socialist countries' external equal and mutually beneficial economic cooperation is a "threat". During the Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference, some people in Britain were keen on promoting the "Soviet economic challenge" and inciting new anti-Soviet hysteria, which, apart from some political considerations, deliberately putting the real threat from across the ocean behind the scenes, there can be no other explanation.

Now Britain has expressed their reasonable welcome attitude towards expanding East-West trade. Britain and some other Commonwealth and sterling area countries have also used "exception clauses" to relax some restrictions. But this is still far from enough. To truly smooth East-West trade, it is necessary to completely abolish the "embargo," which has proven to only damage the interests of countries that implement the restrictive policies stipulated by the United States.

An important issue discussed at the conference was strengthening internal relations within the Commonwealth. In this regard, Britain stated that it is "determined to maintain and strengthen its ability as a source of capital for the development of Commonwealth countries." Any assistance to backward countries in developing their economies on an equal and mutually beneficial basis is welcomed by the people. The modern economic development of backward countries, thereby promoting the expansion of international trade and economic cooperation, is also in line with Britain's legitimate trade and economic interests. However, it is unrealistic to maintain interests based on exploitation and enslavement. Any attempt to prevent backward countries from developing their own independent economies will inevitably not yield results. There is still an abnormal situation: India and some other countries are carrying out large-scale economic construction and need to import a large number of means of production, while British industry, due to its great strength being used for military production, has failed to meet these countries' large needs for capital.

British bourgeois newspapers are enthusiastically discussing the future of the Commonwealth. The "Times" has published editorials in succession, explaining the benefits of the Commonwealth to member countries, but it cannot but mention the question: "Whether they can maintain it and how long they can maintain it are the main questions for the future." In fact, the key issue of the current Commonwealth lies in the extent to which it builds itself on a solid foundation of peace, independence, and equal cooperation.

    评英联邦总理会议的结果
    胡今
    为期十天的英联邦总理会议已经结束。会议讨论了国际形势各方面和有关英联邦的许多问题，最后发表了一个公报，表示希望和平，要求加强英联邦的作用。虽然公报在这方面没有提出具体的办法和步骤，而且有些措辞是含糊的，但是可以看出，这次会议的结果，对英联邦和世界局势都具有重要的意义。
    据各方的报道，这次会议主要讨论了国际关系中的新形势以及有关英联邦前途和重新估计英联邦地位的重要问题，因而它被称为战后“最重要的一次”会议。
    近几年来，国际局势发生了急剧的变化，和平和战争力量的对比发生了根本的变化，民族独立的运动空前高涨，和平共处和民族独立成了势不可挡的世界政治潮流，冷战、拼凑侵略性军事集团和殖民主义政策不断遭到了挫败，这个政策所造成的英帝国和英联邦的深刻危机也随着表面化了。因此，国际局势特别是东西方关系问题，在英联邦总理会议的议程中占着压倒的地位，同时，这个问题被紧密地同英联邦的地位和它的内部问题，如“防务”和财政经济问题，保持和加强英联邦内部关系问题联系起来，这是完全可以理解的。
    从这一点来看，公报表明会议对国际紧张局势和扩军备战的祸害表示了适当的不安，并宣告：“全体英联邦国家的政策，在任何时候都将以维持和巩固世界和平为目的”，这是具有积极意义的。人们也注意到会议对当前局势中某些重大问题所表示的态度，例如，公报宣布英联邦总理们“认为设法达成广泛的裁军协议是重要的”，表示欢迎苏联政府最近采取的大量裁军和促进同各国的友好关系和联系的措施，认为“苏联和其他大国的关系的逐步改进，将有助于消除战争恐惧，并且是符合世界和平的利益的。”同时，公报提到英联邦各国政府将努力谋求悬而未决的国际问题的解决。公报也“表示希望联合国的会员能够更进一步的扩大。”公报肯定说，英联邦国家能够为维持世界各地区的和平，谋求悬而未决的国际问题的解决，发挥重要的作用。这些都是值得欢迎的。但是公报把减轻人民的军备负担不必要地同解决悬而未决的国际问题连在一起，这将给予“好战”势力以口实，利用国际争端来继续推行扩军备战的政策。
    艾登首相在英联邦总理会议上对国际局势作了一些比较现实的估计，他认为这次会议应该成为“在使世界陷于分裂的两个大国（苏联和美国）之间建造桥梁的长期过程的一部分。”艾登肯定说，英联邦能够帮助美国和苏联更加接近。他并提出了再召开一次“最高级”会议的必要性问题。的确，苏美关系的改善，在目前国际局势下具有最重要的意义。苏联在这方面一直采取着主动，并作了很大的努力。问题在于美国的某些集团至今不肯放弃制造猜疑和敌对的“冷战”政策。应该指出，如果没有得到其他西方国家的支持，美国这个政策是很难继续保持的。近来各国领导人之间的接触日益频繁，特别是苏英、苏法的会谈，已使大国和许多国家之间的关系得到了很大的增进。可以想见，如果英国有效地采取促进东西方谅解的行动，在苏美之间起“桥梁”的作用，当会产生积极的成果。
    改善东西方关系的另一关键，在于缓和远东地区，特别是台湾地区的紧张局势。公报表示“他们盼望台湾地区的紧张局势不断缓和，”并且表示“这个地区的问题必须得到和平解决”。大家知道，台湾地区的紧张局势是完全由于美国使用武力侵占了中国领土台湾而造成的。中国政府和人民并不要同美国打仗，愿意和平解决同美国的争端，消除台湾地区的紧张局势。周恩来总理最近正式代表我国政府宣布，愿意通过直接谈判和平解放台湾。但是美国至今仍然用武力占领台湾，而且公然企图使它侵占台湾的现状得到承认。这使得问题复杂起来。中国人民欢迎任何有助于缓和台湾地区紧张局势的善良愿望和努力，但是决不能容许美国以任何借口继续侵占我国领土台湾。
    英联邦总理会议中一些国家表示应该恢复中华人民共和国在联合国的合法地位和取消对中国的禁运，这些积极的建议也将受到中国人民的欢迎。这些有利于缓和局势的步骤，已经得到亚非国家和其他国家的广泛的支持。澳大利亚“每日电讯报”就指出：改善对中国的贸易和外交关系，是“有见识的，同时也是不可避免的。”
    英联邦总理会议对维护和巩固和平所表明的愿望，是当前国际局势中出现的又一个积极的因素。在这里，作为独立的大国之一的印度起了重要的作用。英国“曼彻斯特卫报”也认为，印度对世界事务的态度是“建设性态度”。锡兰采取和平中立政策的意义也在会议上得到了证明。印度报业托辣斯报道说：会议的主持者“现在比过去任何时候都更加愿意正视亚洲和非洲的现实”了。
    不同社会制度的国家的和平共处，是符合于所有国家的利益的。今天国际力量对比的变化，有利于共处，而不利于战争打算。英国领导人曾指出这样一个事实：除了疯子以外，任何人都不能再打算以武力来征服世界。根据这样的认识，英国采取了削减军费的初步措施，并认为有必要修改“防御”政策。但还必须看到，在英国，正有人在“原子均势”的名义下，竭力企图替原子军备竞赛和侵略性军事集团的政策作辩护。在他们说来，仿佛减少常规军备，把更多的人力物力投入加强原子军备方面，会对和平有好处。他们继续阻挠打开裁军僵局的努力，并鼓吹加强“防务”，保持侵略性军事集团。这种所谓以“实力求和平”的陈旧观念，同真正的和平共处毫无共同之处。
    尼赫鲁总理说得对：“最好的防御就是友好关系”。友谊产生友谊，并将产生真正的安全。而且还应该指出，今天谁对共处有最大的信心，谁能把沉重的军备负担卸得最轻，谁就能够在和平竞赛中取得最大的好处。对于这一点，正在军备负担的重压下喘不过气来的国家，应该是体会最深的。路透社在一条电讯中就报道说：现在向英联邦政治家们提出的问题是，他们是否能够像苏联已经在做的那样把更多的资源转移到新的经济斗争方面去？这对英国是具有现实意义的尖锐问题。
    会议公报强调了保持和加强经济力量的“头等重要意义。”在这里，值得注意的是，据报道，英联邦总理会议曾讨论了英国提出的一项计划，这个计划是要加强和扩大英联邦，使之成为对抗苏联的“竞争性共处”和美国资本对英联邦利益范围的入侵的“第三种经济力量。”
    必须指出，硬说有所谓“苏联经济的渗入”，甚至由此带来“共产党的扩张”，这是完全没有根据的。事实是，苏联和其他社会主义国家没有垄断资本集团，也没有生产过剩的危机，不必要同任何国家争夺市场和势力范围。它们只是愿意无私地支持落后国家独立经济的发展，给予这些国家以不附带任何政治经济条件的财政经济援助，并积极地同这些国家建立和发展平等互惠的经济合作，同时也愿意争取同其他所有国家，包括最先进资本主义国家，发展经济上和贸易上的广泛联系。因此，这种新型的国际经济合作，根本不存在排他性和侵略性，这是同帝国主义国家从来所建立的、现在仍力图保持的那种利己主义的对外经济关系，有着本质的区别。
    既然宣布要作东西方之间谅解的桥梁，“第三种经济力量”的计划没有任何理由认为社会主义国家对外的平等互惠的经济合作的发展是一个“威胁”。在英联邦总理会议期间，英国有些人热中于宣传“苏联经济挑战”，煽动新的反苏歇斯底里，这除了出于某种政治上的考虑，故意要把来自大洋彼岸的真正威胁放在幕后，是不可能有别的解释的。
    现在英国对于扩大东西方的贸易，已表示了他们的合理的欢迎态度。英国和其他一些英联邦和英镑区国家并且已经运用“例外条款”放宽了一些限制。但是这还是非常不够的。要使东西方贸易真正畅通，就必须完全取消“禁运”，事实证明“禁运”只是损害执行美国规定的限制政策的国家的利益。
    会议讨论的一项重要问题是加强英联邦内部的关系。这方面，英国表明它“决心保持和加强它的能力，以作为英联邦国家的开发的一个资本的来源”。任何在平等互惠的基础上帮助落后国家发展经济，都是人们所欢迎的。落后国家现代化的经济发展，从而促成国际贸易和经济合作的扩大，也符合于英国的正当的贸易和经济利益。但是，如果要保持建立在剥削和奴役的基础上的利益，那是不现实的。任何想阻挡落后国家发展自己的独立经济的企图，是必然不会得到结果的。现在还存在着这样一种不正常的情况：印度和其他一些国家正在大规模地进行经济建设，需要输入大量的生产资料，而英国工业由于以很大的力量用于军事生产，却未能满足这些国家的对资本的大量需要。
    英国资产阶级报纸热烈地讨论着英联邦的前途问题。“泰晤士报”连续发表社论，说明英联邦对于成员国的好处，但不能不提到这样的问题：“他们是否能够维持和能够维持多久，是将来的主要问题”。其实，当前英联邦的关键问题，在于它在多大程度上把自己建立在和平、独立和平等合作的可靠的基础上。
