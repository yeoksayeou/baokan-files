Title: "The U.S. Far East Policy in a Dilemma"

Editor's Note: This article originally appeared in the British "Scotsman" on July 17. In this article, the author, Raul Knox, examines the predicament of U.S. Far East policy from a British perspective. Although he intentionally or unintentionally made some traditional distortions and slanders against communism and China (we have deleted some of these slanders), he rightly pointed out that the U.S. occupation of Taiwan is the clearest manifestation of U.S. colonialism.

    U.S. Vice President Nixon's recent hurried trip to Asia could have been intended to divide the continent in half.

    In Taiwan, he handed Marshal Chiang Kai-shek an encouraging letter from the President and explained that, as far as he knew, President Eisenhower had never considered diplomatically recognizing Communist China. In Manila, he expressed dissatisfaction with neutralists, saying they could not morally distinguish between the communist and free worlds. During a two-and-a-half-hour stopover at Bangkok airport at night, he affirmed his trust in Thailand's attitude and said that Asian countries would not be fooled by Russia's new policy direction. In all these places, he chose to say in Karachi that the notion that communist aid is not incompatible with freedom is a failure to read history correctly.

    It is not surprising that dissatisfaction with American policy in Asia is now more than just Indian impatience or British caution. This sentiment also exists in the U.S. embassies in the Far East itself. As the communist world expands its economic campaign to win the favor of all Asian countries, such events as Nixon's visits to America's military allies in the East seem truly old-fashioned.

    In most parts of Asia, the word colonialism evokes indescribably deep emotions and is interpreted in the broadest sense. Whatever benefits colonialism may have once brought to Asia, these benefits have long been forgotten, just like Mussolini's achievement of making Italian trains run on time.

    When Asians discover that individual USAID officials in Washington disapprove of any agricultural aid programs that may result in competition with American grain, and when they see that the larger part of USAID's dollars in Asia is spent on weapons "to defend the free world" and in countries such as Taiwan, South Korea, and South Vietnam – where freedom is a repugnant word – they cry colonialism.

    The existence of this sentiment is a fact. Because it is an emotion rather than a logical conclusion, it is virtually impossible to eradicate. Today, Asians are asking Americans some difficult questions.

    They point out that the wars in Korea and Indochina ended long ago. If Americans think there is an imminent danger of war breaking out again, will they withdraw their troops from Japan? Then why do Chiang Kai-shek, Syngman Rhee, and Ngo Dinh Diem need more expensive weapons? Indeed, isn't this somewhat confirming the old rumor of letting Asians fight Asians?

    At the end of a war, it is customary to allow the parties that have recently been at war to resume normal relations within the shortest reasonable time. If it is possible to shake hands with Germans, Italians, and Japanese – all aggressors in a war that killed many Americans – is it pointless to deal with the Chinese, who fought in a war that killed fewer Americans? This is not a communist argument, but a question raised by Asians who are equally suspicious of colonialism and communism. These are not easy questions to answer, and few Asians accept the notion that communism is the only threat in the world today and that it is still determined to engage in military aggression. It also doesn't really help to make the issue moral, as Nixon did in Manila.

    The U.S. Far East policy has fallen into a predicament. It is extremely important that it and its Western allies should understand this predicament. The difficulty is that the U.S. refuses – rightly or wrongly – to compromise on its attitude toward the Taiwan issue. The group of neutral Asian countries and one or two other countries believe that Taiwan should be territory under the control of the ruling government in Beijing. Due to the fears and perceptions of colonialism among Asian independent countries, they believe that the biggest threat to peace in the Far East is the military power established by the United States in and around Taiwan.

    Most Americans would reply that this statement is untrue and that what they are doing in Taiwan is none of anyone else's business. The problem is that if the U.S. continues to pursue its current policy toward China, it must anticipate losing friends and influence in Asian countries that Mr. Nixon has not visited, and probably in the two countries he has visited – Pakistan and Thailand.

    The U.S. Seventh Fleet patrolling the Taiwan Strait will hold back the communist armies, but communist tractors, technicians, communist peace offensives, and smiles will enter Asia through the back door and can comfortably stay there. The West can certainly wait for the communists to make mistakes, but this is a poor policy compared to a policy of continuous victory. Many Westerners, including some Americans, have concluded that in order to compete for friendship with communism in the broader aspects of Asia, it is first necessary to reach an agreement with communism on the Taiwan issue.

### “美国远东政策进退两难”

    “美国远东政策进退两难”
    编者按　本文原载七月十七日英国“苏格兰人报”，作者劳尔·诺克斯在这篇文章里从一个英国人的角度考察了美国远东政策的窘境。虽然他有意无意地对共产主义和中国作了一些传统式的曲解和诬蔑（这种诬蔑我们删去了一部分），但是他指出美国侵占台湾是美国殖民主义的最明白不过的表现，这一点是完全正确的。
    最近美国副总统尼克松在亚洲所作的一次匆匆旅行，本来可能是为了把这个大陆分为两半。
    在台湾，他交给蒋介石元帅一封总统写的鼓励信并解释说，就他所知，艾森豪威尔总统从来没有考虑在外交上承认共产党中国。在马尼拉，他表示不满意中立主义者，说他们不能够从道义上划分共产党和自由世界之间的界线。在曼谷机场的夜里两个半小时的停留中，他肯定地说他信赖泰国的态度，并且说，亚洲国家不会受俄国新政策方针的骗。在所有这些地方中，他挑选在喀喇蚩来说这样的话：认为共产党的援助同自由并不矛盾的说法是没有正确地阅读历史。
    对于美国在亚洲政策的不满情绪，目前已经不只是印度人的不耐心或英国人的谨慎了，这是不足为奇的。在美国自己在远东的大使馆里也有这种情绪。当共产党世界扩大它的经济运动来争取所有亚洲国家好感的时候，像尼克松访问美国在东方的军事盟友的这种盛事，看来确实是老式的。
    在亚洲大部分地区，殖民主义这个词引起难以形容的深深激动情绪，并且在最广泛的意义上被人加以解释，无论殖民主义一度可能给亚洲带来了什么好处，这些好处就像墨索里尼使意大利列车按时行驶的功绩一样早已被人遗忘了。
    当亚洲人发现华盛顿在一些国家里有个别的援外事务管理署官员不赞成结果可能造成同美国粮食竞争的任何农业援助计划的时候，当他们看到在亚洲，援外事务管理署的较大部分的美元都花费在“为了保卫自由世界的”武器上和用在如像台湾、南朝鲜和南越这类国家里——在这类国家里，自由是令人生厌的字——的时候，他们就喊叫殖民主义。
    这种情绪的存在是一个事实。由于它是一种情绪而不是一种逻辑上的结论，实际上它是不可能被消灭的。今天，亚洲人正在向美国人提出一些难堪的问题。
    他们指出朝鲜和印度支那的战争很早就停止了。如果美国人认为有再次爆发战争的紧急危险，他们会撤退他们在日本的军队吗？那么，蒋介石、李承晚和吴庭艳为什么还需要更费钱的武器呢？的确，这不是有点证实那个让亚洲人打亚洲人的旧的谣传吗？
    在战争结束时，通常是让最近曾经交战过的双方在最短的合理时间内恢复正常关系。如果同德国人、意大利人和日本人——他们全是在一场杀死了许多美国人的战争中的侵略者——握手是可能的，那么同那些在一场打死较少的美国人的战争中的中国打交道是没有意义的事吗？这不是共产党人的辩论，而是对殖民主义和共产主义同样怀疑的亚洲人提出的问题。这些不是容易答复的问题，如果你们的唯一命题是：共产主义是今天世界唯一的威胁，而且它仍然决心从事军事侵略的话，很少亚洲人接受这种说法。它也不能真正帮助使这个问题具有道义性，好像尼克松在马尼拉所做的那样。
    美国的远东政策已经陷入窘境。一件极重要的事情就是它同它的西方盟国应该了解这种窘境。困难之点是美国拒绝——不论对与不对——在对台湾问题的态度上让步，亚洲的中立国家集团和一、两个其他国家认为台湾应该是北京的统治政府控制之下的领土。由于亚洲的独立国家对殖民主义的担心和看法，它们认为远东和平的最大威胁是美国在台湾和台湾附近建立的军事力量。
    大多数美国人都会答复说，这种说法是不真实的，他们在台湾所做的事情是用不着别人操心的。问题在于，如果美国继续执行它目前的对华政策，它必须要预料到它将在尼克松先生没有访问的亚洲国家中失去朋友和影响，大概在他曾经访问过的两个国家——巴基斯坦和泰国——也要失去朋友和影响。
    在台湾海峡巡逻的美国第七舰队会把共产党的军队挡住，但是，共产党的拖拉机、技术人员、共产党的和平攻势和微笑将从后门进入亚洲，而且，还可以舒舒服服地停留在那里。西方当然可以等待共产党人犯错误，但是，这同不断取得胜利的政策比较起来是一个可怜的政策。许多西方人士，包括某些美国人在内所得出的结论是：为着在亚洲更广泛的方面同共产主义竞争友谊，首先有必要同共产主义在台湾问题上达成协议。
