    The American Warrior in a Dirty Shirt
    Soviet Union　De·Saslavski
    There is a medieval legend about a warlike warrior whose appetite for war far exceeded his combat abilities. When he failed to satisfy his appetites, either with declarations of love or with violent threats, on the female lord of a neighboring fortress, he swore to God that he would not change his shirt until he achieved his goal.
    Perhaps the vow to place a dirty shirt on the sacred altar was not tempting to God, or perhaps for other reasons—the warrior was unsuccessful no matter what. However, the unbearable itch caused by the dirty shirt and the proliferation of parasites on it drove the warrior to roll furiously on the ground, cursing his vow, himself, and God. He felt particularly miserable in the hot summer.
    When the statement from Washington blew in on the wind, declaring that the United States would never recognize the People's Republic of China, I was reminded of this medieval legend. At the same time, a smell drifted across the ocean, indicating that it was indeed hot in Washington, and that the fanatical stubbornness of the stubborn warriors in the American diplomatic community threatened the sanitary conditions of the American capital, while also causing unspeakable torment to the warriors themselves. They simply refuse to change their foreign policy, or change their shirts. Such perseverance would be admirable if applied to other, more reasonable goals. As it is, this behavior can only evoke astonishment.
    In the past, a long time ago, "non-recognition" was undoubtedly a formidable weapon, implying war. Later, "non-recognition" was accompanied by other tools such as blockade, embargo, armed intervention, and "position of strength." However, the weapon of "non-recognition" has gradually become obsolete, and now it is in the same category as halberds, longswords, and mortars. This is evidenced by historical examples.
    At the end of the eighteenth century, Britain declared a blockade against its colonies in America. It refused to recognize the independence of these colonies and prohibited the transport of goods into America. As everyone knows, this blockade failed. What was the reason? Mainly because Britain could not completely encircle America with a line of sentries. And France, then the greatest maritime power, did not recognize the embargo and transported goods and weapons to America. Britain was defeated, and after a brief attack of stubbornness, recognized the United States as an independent nation.
    For another example, Napoleon, the virtual dictator of the entire continent of Western Europe, wanting to completely isolate and weaken Britain, declared the famous "Continental Blockade" against the British Isles. This blockade also failed. What was the reason? The same reason: the strength to completely surround Britain with an iron ring, isolating it from the world and starving it, was insufficient. The French fleet was not strong enough, and the European countries that obeyed Napoleon did not actually listen to his orders. As for Russia, it was fundamentally opposed to the blockade. Therefore, the iron ring that Napoleon wanted to use to strangle Britain was broken in many places. Britain was not isolated at all, and Napoleon had to admit defeat.
    A third example is not long ago, in 1918, when the capitalist countries refused to recognize the young Soviet Socialist Republic and declared a blockade. Fourteen countries, led by the United States, Britain, and France, occupied some areas on the borders around Soviet Russia, strictly prohibiting the import of goods and strengthening their "non-recognition" with armed intervention. It seemed that the encirclement was tight, and the strength was terrifying, but what was the result? The intervention and blockade all failed shamefully. Why? There are many reasons. The first and most important reason is that a modern great power whose people fight heroically for their independence cannot be subdued. The blockade did not weaken the power of the Soviet people, but strengthened it. The second reason is that the working class and peasants in capitalist countries were unwilling to support the policy of blockading worker-peasant countries and opposed armed intervention. The third reason: there was no firm agreement between the capitalist governments, and their alliance disintegrated due to internal contradictions. The policy based on "position of strength" was also ineffective. The whole world saw how the governments of the various capitalist countries, one after another, rushed to recognize the Soviet Union, and the United States government finally had to do the same. The Soviets are not ones to bear grudges. They said, it's okay, better late than never. When Washington changed its foreign policy and changed its shirt, the world breathed a sigh of relief.
    What conclusion should be drawn from this? Isn't it that the policies of blockade, embargo, "non-recognition," and willfulness are utterly rotten! The world is no longer the world of feudal separatism and fortresses everywhere. The strength needed to isolate a great power is possessed by no single country. For a great country like China, all threats are just bluff, and whoever isolates China is only isolating themselves. To blockade a country with six hundred million people, free and proud, and aware of its own strength, is not just a mistake, it is foolish and sinful.
    The Soviet state was once the only socialist country in the world. It was indeed almost completely surrounded. It had no friends among the governments of other countries. And yet it still achieved victory by its own strength. But how can the great Chinese people, who have loyal friends and allies in the North, East, and South, be surrounded?
    How can China, which has friendly ties with the whole world, be isolated from the world? What force can hinder the closest and most fraternal alliance between the two greatest socialist countries—the Soviet Union and China?
    No matter how many billions of dollars the United States Congress allocates to the American armed forces, their fleet cannot stop the ships of almost the entire world. It cannot be done, and the blockade will fail.
    The American government cannot reach an agreement with its allies on the policy of "non-recognition." The imperialist bloc is increasingly like the three-horse carriage in Krylov's fable: the swan, the pike, and the lobster harnessed to a large cart. The American lobster moves backward, the British trading pike pulls into the water, and the French swan rushes into the sky. Thus, the blockade collapses.
    The people of all countries in the world demand that the American government end this obviously bankrupt policy, demand the restoration of the legitimate status of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations, and stop the unreasonable and sinful puppet show it is putting on with Chiang Kai-shek... It is clear that while the United States is pursuing a meaningless policy of isolating China, it is also achieving some success in isolating itself, and is going further and further down this path of isolation.
    The Chinese people can quietly wait for the end of this tragic arrogance, just as the Soviet people once waited patiently. How to deal with those warriors who have vowed not to take off their shirts? In this hot summer, their fate is indeed pitiable.
    We can only say a few words on the subject of public health and personal hygiene, it is best to put on a washed and ironed shirt in time, it is better than waiting for a shroud like Freistler.

    穿着脏衬衣的美国武士
    苏联　德·萨斯拉夫斯基
    中世纪有个关于一位好战成性的武士的传说。这位武士的好战癖大大超过了他的战斗能力。当他无论用爱情的表白，无论用暴力的威吓都没有使相邻的堡垒的女领主满足他的癖性以后，他便向上帝发誓：达不到目的决不更换衬衣。
    或许是他许下的要把脏衬衣放到神圣的祭坛上的誓愿不能引诱上帝，或许是因为其他原因——武士无论如何也没有成功。但是，脏衬衣引起的奇痒难忍，衬衣上繁殖起来的寄生虫又如此之多，结果使得武士狂怒地在地上打滚。一边滚一边咒骂自己的誓愿，咒骂自己和上帝。在炎热的夏天，他更感到特别难受。
    当风从华盛顿吹来了关于美国无论如何都不承认中华人民共和国的声明的时候，我想起了中世纪的这个传说。同时，随风还从海洋彼岸飘来了一股气味，这说明华盛顿正是热天，说明美国外交界倔强的武士们的热狂的顽固态度，威胁着美国首都的卫生情况，同时也使武士本人受到难言的折磨。他们无论如何都不更改自己的外交政策，也不换自己的衬衣。这种坚持精神，如果用在其他更加合理的目标上是不能不博得赞美的。而现在，这种行为却只能引起惊讶。
    过去，在很久以前，“不承认”无疑是一种可畏的武器，它意味着战争。后来，随着“不承认”而来的还有封锁、禁运、武装干涉和“实力地位”等其他工具。然而，“不承认”这一武器逐渐陈旧了，现在它已同戟、长剑、臼炮等武器列入一类了。这一点有历史实例为证。
    十八世纪末，英国对自己在美洲的殖民地宣布了封锁。它不愿承认这些殖民地的独立，并禁止把商品运入美洲。大家都知道，这次封锁失败了。原因何在呢？主要因为英国不能用哨兵线把美洲团团围住。而法国，当时最大的海上强国，不承认禁运并往美国运送商品和武器。英国吃了败仗，经过了顽固病的短期发作后，承认了美国是一个独立的国家。
    再举一个例子，拿破仑这位整个西欧大陆的实际独裁者，想要完全孤立和削弱英国，就宣布对英国各岛实行著名的“大陆封锁”。这次封锁也失败了，原因何在呢？同样的原因：要完完全全把英国用铁环围住，使它同全世界隔离，使它遭受饥饿，而力不足也。法国舰队的力量是不够的，而欧洲那些听命于拿破仑的国家实际上并不听他的命令。至于俄国，它根本是反对封锁的。因此，拿破仑想要用来扼死英国的铁环，在许多地方都被打破了。英国一点都没有遭到隔绝，拿破仑则不得不承认失败。
    第三个例子是不久以前的事，1918年，资本主义国家拒绝承认年轻的苏维埃社会主义共和国，并宣布了封锁。十四个国家在美、英、法的率领下占领了苏俄四周边界上的一些地方，严格禁止输入商品并用武装干涉来加强自己的这种“不承认”。看起来包围是严密的，而实力也是令人可怕的，结果怎样呢？干涉和封锁全部可耻地破了产。为什么呢？原因很多。第一个也是最重要的原因是：如果一个现代大国的人民为自己的独立而英勇奋战，是不能使它屈服的。封锁不但没有削弱苏维埃人民的威力，反而加强了它。第二个原因是：资本主义国家中的工人阶级和农民不愿意支持封锁工农国家的政策，反对武装干涉。第三个原因：资本主义政府之间没有牢固的协议，它们的同盟因内部矛盾而分崩离析。从“实力地位”出发的政策也没有效用。全世界都看见各资本主义国家的政府怎样一个接着一个争先恐后地承认了苏联，美国政府最后也不得不这样办。苏联人不是爱记前仇的。他们说，没有什么，晚也比没有好。当华盛顿改变了对外政策和换了衬衣的时候，世界比较轻松地松了一口气。
    由此应该得出怎样的结论呢？不正是封锁、禁运、“不承认”和逞性妄为的政策已腐朽透顶了吗！世界已经不是那封建割据时代和到处都是堡垒的世界了。为了要孤立一个大国所需要的力量，是任何一个国家都没有的。对于像中国这样的伟大国家，各种威吓都不过是吹牛而已，谁要孤立中国，就只是孤立自己。封锁一个有六亿人民、自由而自豪的、了解自己的力量的国家，这不只是错误，这是愚蠢和罪恶。
    苏维埃国家曾经是世界上唯一的社会主义国家。它确实曾经几乎完全被包围过。它在其他国家的政府中间一个朋友都没有。而它仍然以自己的力量获取了胜利。可是怎么能包围在北方、东方、南方都有忠实的朋友和同盟者的伟大的中国人民呢？
    怎么能使同全世界有着友谊联系的中国同世界隔绝呢？有什么力量能够妨害两个最伟大的社会主义国家——苏联和中国——的最亲密、最友爱的兄弟般的同盟呢？
    无论美国国会给美国的武装力量拨出多少亿美元，他们的舰队也不能挡住几乎全世界的船只。这是办不到的事，封锁也失败了。
    美国政府在“不承认”政策上不能同自己的盟国达成一致意见。帝国主义集团已越来越像克雷洛夫寓言中的三套马车了：天鹅、棱鱼和龙虾合驾着一辆大车。美国龙虾开倒车，英国的作买卖的梭鱼向水里拉，而法国的天鹅则冲向天空。于是封锁垮台。
    全世界各国人民都要求美国政府结束这种显然破了产的政策，要求恢复中华人民共和国在联合国中的合法地位，停止不合理的、罪恶的同蒋介石耍的木偶戏……很清楚，美国一方面奉行着毫无意义的孤立中国的政策，同时它在孤立自己方面却也不无成就，而且还顺着这条孤立的道路越走越远。
    中国人民可以静静地等待着这种悲剧式的傲慢的结束，就像苏联人民曾经耐心地等待着的一样。怎么发落那些发誓不脱衬衣的武士们呢？在这炎热的夏天，他们的命运确是值得怜惜。
    我们只能就公共卫生和个人保健方面谈几句话，最好是及时穿上洗净了熨平了的衬衣，这比像弗莱斯特尔那样等着穿寿衣要好得多。
