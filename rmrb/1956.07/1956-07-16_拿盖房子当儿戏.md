    Treating House Building as Child's Play
    Last winter and this spring, the Housing Department of the Dahuofang Reservoir Engineering Bureau in Liaoning Province built 260 mud houses and 2,125 lean-to sheds for the Fifth Detachment of the Huai River Harnessing Committee Engineering Corps participating in the Dahuofang Reservoir project. These temporary houses were used as offices, dormitories, warehouses, and kitchens for the engineering team. During construction, the Housing Department of the Engineering Bureau neglected the cold weather conditions and ignored the quality and safety of the project. Of the 121 mud houses and lean-to sheds, some were built on frozen soil and some on cinder (the area used to be an open-pit mine). The eaves of the mud houses were just over two meters high, and the wooden pillars buried underground were only three Chinese inches long. The roofs were covered with a layer of sorghum stalks and a layer of asphalt felt paper. The walls swayed in the wind. After the first heavy rain in early April, 25% of the houses leaked. We suggested reinforcing or renovating the houses, but Section Chief Zhao of the General Affairs Section replied: "What does it have to do with us? This is your Fifth Detachment's business; we are just helping out..." As for the lean-to sheds, we believe it was a fundamental mistake to build the workers' quarters, which need to be used for three years, as lean-to sheds in the Northeast region. A lean-to shed means a shed roof covered with sorghum stalks, a layer of mud, and a layer of straw, with no walls and windows installed on the roof, called "tilting windows." The foundation of the house had no drainage ditches dug around it, so water entered the shed from all sides when it rained, and the windows leaked. The long fire wall inside the house collapsed in 31 houses during the first fire in March. Some fire walls, although not collapsed, only smoked and did not catch fire. In the summer, the houses were very hot. Some comrades said, "These houses are really 'cold in winter and hot in summer' safety deposit boxes."
    Due to the poor quality of the houses, ten collapsed on June 14th, injuring seven people, one of whom had his right femur fractured, and another had his genitals damaged.
    Some houses are not warm, not safe, and not hygienic. We suggested renovating and installing fire walls, but Comrade Pu Ming, the second section chief of the Housing Department, said, "It's just temporary construction, just make do!" Can a project that will not be completed until 1958 be called "temporary construction"? Can personal safety issues be compromised?
    Under these circumstances, the leaders of the Fifth Detachment had no choice but to assign cadres and workers to specialize in the renovation and reinforcement of the workers' quarters, wasting a lot of the country's money.
                                                                                                                                Yu Wei

    拿盖房子当儿戏
    辽宁省大伙房水库工程局房产科在去冬今春为参加大伙房水库工程的治淮委员会工程总队第五支队建筑了草泥房二百六十间、马架房二千一百二十五间，这些临时性房屋是作为工程队的办公室、宿舍、仓库、厨房等用的。工程局房产科在施工中，忽视了寒冷的气候条件，也忽视了工程的质量和安全。一百二十一幢草泥房和马架房，一部分搭在冻土层上，一部分搭在煤渣上（此地过去是露天矿），草泥房檐高二公尺多一点，地下埋的木柱脚仅有三公寸，屋顶上盖一层秫秸和一层油毛毡纸。一刮风墙壁就幌荡起来。四月初下了第一场大雨，就有25％的房子漏水了。我们曾经建议把房子加固或改修，总务科赵科长的回答是：“于我们有什么相干，这是你们五支队的事，我们不过是帮忙的……。”至于马架房，我们认为，在东北地区，把需要住三年的工房盖成马架房，根本就是错误的。所谓马架房，就是棚顶盖秫秸放一层泥，放一层稻草，没有墙，窗子安在屋盖上，叫做“仰翻窗”。房屋的地基四周没挖排水沟，一到下雨，工棚四面进水，窗子漏水。屋里的一条长火墙，三月间第一次生火，就有三十一幢房内的火墙倒塌了。有的火墙虽未倒塌，也只闷烟不着火。夏天，房子很热。有些同志说：“这房子真是冬不暖、夏不凉的保险箱子。”
    由于房子的质量差，六月十四日，倒塌了十间，打伤了七个人，其中一人右大腿骨打断了，另一个生殖器打坏了。
    有些房子不保暖，不安全，不合乎卫生条件，我们建议翻修、装火墙，房产科第二科长朴明同志说：“临时施工，将就一下吧！”到1958年才能完成的工程，能说是“临时施工”吗？人身安全问题能将就吗？
    五支队领导人员，在这种情况下，只好抽出干部和工人专门进行工房的翻修、加固工作，耗费了国家不少的钱。　　　　　余　威
