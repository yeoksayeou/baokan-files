    Washington Politicians Publicly State that the U.S. Wants to Force Egypt to Abandon Neutrality by Refusing Aid for Dam Construction
    Cairo Radio Denounces the Imperialist Conspiracy of the U.S. and Britain
    Xinhua News Agency, July 22nd dispatch from Washington: Washington political figures, in discussing the U.S. withdrawal of its proposal to aid Egypt in constructing the Aswan Dam, have openly stated that the purpose of the U.S. is to force Egypt to abandon its neutral policy. The United Press International pointed out: This action by the U.S. "is considered a major decision to adopt a new tough stance toward the Nasser government."
    Senator Thye, a Republican member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, said on July 21st: He "believes that U.S. Secretary of State Dulles' withdrawal of the U.S. aid proposal is a diplomatic action aimed at forcing Egypt to choose between East and West."
    Thye said: "If Egypt provides substantial evidence to show that it is on our side, I believe that the issue of funding the dam construction can be reopened after Congress reconvenes (next year) in January."
    Associated Press reporter Hightower, citing high-ranking figures in Washington, pointed out that this action by the U.S. is also directed at many neutral countries. The reporter said: State Department officials said: The U.S. withdrawal of the aid proposal is a "stern warning: the U.S. is unwilling to tolerate 'blackmail' bargaining."
    At the same time, some people in Washington have expressed concern about the effect of this "deliberate gamble" by the State Department. According to a United Press International report, this action has already caused divided opinions in Washington. "Critics say: Although Nasser's actions are troubling and irritating, he is, after all, the biggest political figure in the Arab world today, and Egypt is still the most influential Arab country. They believe that the U.S. goal should be to keep Egypt neutral rather than drive it into the arms of Russia."
    Xinhua News Agency, July 22nd dispatch from Cairo: A news commentator at Cairo Radio said on July 21st: The U.S. and Britain's withdrawal of their proposal to help Egypt build the Aswan Dam is "another imperialist conspiracy."
    The commentator said: "The West has exposed their true intentions towards the Arabs. They want to force Egypt to join their defense treaty and bow to Israel in return for their financial assistance. But when they discovered that Nasser was leading Egypt out of imperialism and towards sound neutrality, they revoked their proposal, which they claimed was for the construction of the High Dam and the welfare of Egypt."

    华盛顿政界人士公开表示
    美国想借拒绝助修水坝迫埃及放弃中立
    开罗电台痛斥美英的帝国主义阴谋
    据新华社22日讯　华盛顿消息：华盛顿政界人士在谈到美国撤回它援助埃及建筑阿斯旺水坝的建议的时候公开表明，美国的目的是要迫使埃及放弃它的中立政策。合众社指出：美国这一行动“被认为是对纳赛尔政府采取新的强硬方针的一个重大的决定”。
    参议院拨款委员会共和党委员泰伊七月二十一日说：他“认为美国国务卿杜勒斯撤回美国的援助建议是一个外交行动，其目的在于迫使埃及在东方和西方之间作一选择。”
    泰伊说：“如果埃及拿出实在的证据来表明它是和我们站在一边，我认为这个资助水坝建设的问题在国会（明年）一月复会后就可以重新打开。”
    美联社记者海托华援引华盛顿地位很高的人士的话指出，美国的这一行动也是针对许多中立国家而发的。这个记者说：国务院人士说：美国撤回援助建议是一个“严厉的警告：美国是不甘心忍受‘讹诈性’的讨价还价的”。
    同时，华盛顿也有一些人对国务院这一“有意的冒险”行动的效果表示担心。据合众社报道，这一行动已经在华盛顿引起了分歧的意见。“批评的人说：尽管纳赛尔有些作法令人为难和令人生气，他到底是今天阿拉伯世界最大的政治人物，而埃及仍旧是最有影响的阿拉伯国家。他们认为，美国的目标应该是使埃及保持中立而不是把它赶到俄国怀抱里去。”
    新华社22日讯　开罗消息：开罗电台新闻评论员七月二十一日说：美国和英国撤回帮助埃及修建阿斯旺水坝的建议是“又一个帝国主义阴谋”。
    评论员说：“西方暴露了他们对阿拉伯的真正的用心。他们想使埃及参加他们的防御条约并且向以色列低头，以作为对他们的财政援助的酬答。但是当他们发觉纳赛尔在领导埃及摆脱帝国主义而走向健全的中立的时候，他们就撤销了他们自称是为了建筑高水坝和埃及的福利的建议。”
