Establishing Supply and Marketing Departments in Agricultural Cooperatives Has Many Benefits
Wu Wenrui

After agricultural cooperation, significant changes have occurred in the rural market: on the one hand, fewer farmers are going to market than before; on the other hand, the demand for buying and selling goods in rural areas has increased. With the development of agricultural production, especially rural sideline production, this change will become increasingly apparent. The old method of setting up supply and marketing cooperatives in large market towns and waiting for farmers to come to town for transactions not only wasted farmers' production time but also failed to meet farmers' purchasing and selling needs. In response to the new changes in rural market supply and marketing relationships, the Anhui Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China instructed the grassroots supply and marketing cooperatives to establish supply and marketing departments in agricultural cooperatives, so that the supply and marketing cooperatives could better play a role in ensuring timely purchasing and selling and promoting the development of agricultural and sideline production. More than 1,590 supply and marketing departments have now been established throughout the province, and they have demonstrated many benefits.

The supply and marketing departments facilitate farmers' buying and selling locally, solving the contradictions between farmers' production and purchasing and selling. In the past, in order to focus on production, farmers had to wait for traveling vendors to supply them with necessities such as oil, salt, clothing, and utensils. If they couldn't get it one day, they would have less to eat and use for that day. 社員 [Members] of the Hongqi Agricultural Cooperative in Zhaolou Township, Dangshan County, carried oil and salt cans to the fields while working, but waited for days without seeing a traveling vendor. Sometimes farmers would pool their money to buy things, which often resulted in mistakes. Eight 社員 [members] of the Hongqi Cooperative in Dangshan hired a twelve-year-old child to buy things at Zhouji, but the child bought the wrong things and gave the wrong amount of money. There were many similar situations. These may seem like small matters, but they caused dissatisfaction among the 社員 [members] to varying degrees. After the establishment of the supply and marketing departments, these problems were basically solved. 社員 [Members] happily said, "Now it's never too late to buy salt even after putting the vegetables in the pot." Agricultural 社員 [members] love these supply and marketing departments, and they call them "our own little shops."

The establishment of supply and marketing departments has expanded the purchasing and selling business of the supply and marketing cooperatives and enlivened the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas. On the one hand, the supply and marketing departments supply agricultural production cooperatives with production materials and daily necessities needed by the masses; on the other hand, they promptly adopt various forms to purchase farmers' sideline products. Farmers without cash on hand can exchange eggs for salt, or collect bamboo branches, medicinal materials, hides, hair, animal bones, scrap copper, and scrap iron to hand over to the supply and marketing department in exchange for oil, cloth, or other daily necessities. Therefore, the purchasing and selling business has expanded. For example, the turnover of the supply and marketing department of the Hongxing Agricultural Cooperative in Su County increased from 10 yuan to 30 yuan per day initially. Currently, the general monthly turnover of the agricultural cooperative supply and marketing departments that have been established in various places is 1,600 yuan at most and 600 yuan at least. The number of varieties operated by the supply and marketing departments ranges from 237 to 140. With the development of rural sideline production, the purchasing and selling business is constantly growing.

After the establishment of agricultural cooperative supply and marketing departments, the supply and marketing departments can not only understand the needs of the masses in a timely manner and ensure that the supplied goods are suitable, but also listen to the opinions of the masses in a timely manner and organize purchases. The supply and marketing department of the Dongfanghong Agricultural Cooperative in Liu'an County originally sold Feima brand pens for more than 1.20 yuan each. After the masses reflected that the price was too expensive, they replaced them with five dozen Zhongnan brand pens for 66 cents each, and sold 34 of them within a few days. After the agricultural cooperative proposed to make the handles of the iron shovels smaller and thinner, the supply and marketing department followed suit, and the iron shovels transported by the supply and marketing department were sold out within a few days. The supply and marketing departments can meet the purchasing and selling needs of the masses in a timely manner, making the masses very satisfied.

The agricultural cooperative and the supply and marketing cooperative adopt a dual leadership approach to the supply and marketing department. The agricultural cooperative is responsible for the supply and marketing plan and political leadership of the supply and marketing department; the supply and marketing cooperative is responsible for business (material allocation, pricing), finance (personnel expenses, profit and loss burden). This effectively combines the relationship between production, supply, and sales organizationally. Now, in the agricultural cooperatives that have established supply and marketing departments, 社員 [members] can concentrate on production. They only need to submit a plan to the supply and marketing department for what they want to buy and sell, and they no longer need to worry about buying and selling. The supply and marketing cooperative also has a better understanding of purchases and supplies because its business extends to the agricultural cooperative, greatly reducing the tendency of blind allocation and blind supply, and truly achieving the full utilization of materials and the smooth flow of goods. This method provides favorable conditions for improving commercial work.

    农业社设供销部好处很多
    吴文瑞
    农业合作化以后，农村市场情况有了很大变化：一方面，农民上集交易的比以前减少了；另一方面，农村需要买进卖出的东西比以前有了增加。随着农业生产特别是农村副业生产的发展，这种变化将越来越加明显。过去那种把供销社设在大集镇，等待农民上镇交易的办法，既耽误农民生产时间，又不能满足农民对购销的要求。中共安徽省委针对上述农村市场供销关系的新变化，责成基层供销社到农业社去建立供销部，使供销社更能起到保证及时购销，促进农副业生产发展的作用。现在全省建立起来的供销部已经有一千五百九十多个，它所表现的好处是很多的。
    供销部便利了农民近买近卖，解决了农民在生产和购销方面的矛盾。过去，农民为了忙生产，缺油盐、缺穿用，都要等待串乡小贩来供应。一天等不到，就一天少吃少用。砀山县赵楼乡红旗农业社社员下地生产，把油罐、盐罐背到地里，一连几天都等不到串乡小贩。有时农民把要买的东西集中起来去买，又常常发生差错。砀山红旗社有八户社员找一个十二岁的小孩到周集买东西，结果东西买错了，钱也给错了。类似这样的情况还有很多。这些看来都是小事，却在不同程度上引起了社员的怨言。供销部成立后，这些问题就基本上解决了。社员们高兴地说：“现在把菜下到锅里，买盐也不迟了。”农业社员们热爱这样的供销部，他们都称它为：“我们自己的小店子”。
    供销部的成立，扩大了供销社的购销业务，活跃了城乡物资交流。供销部一方面供应农业生产社生产用品及群众需要的日常生活用品；另一方面又及时地采取不同形式收购农民的副业产品。手里没有现钱的农民，可以用鸡蛋换盐吃，也有搜集竹枝、药材、皮张、毛发、兽骨、废铜、废铁等就近交给供销部，换油、换布或其他日用品的。所以购销业务都扩大了。例如宿县红星农业社供销部的营业额，从最初每天十元增加到三十元。现在，各地已经建立的农业社供销部，一般的每月营业额最高的是一千六百元，最低的也有六百元。供销部经营的品种，多的有二百三十七种，少的有一百四十多种。随着农村副业生产的发展，购销业务正在不断增长。
    设立农业社供销部以后，供销部门不但可以及时了解群众的需要，做到供应的物品对路；并且能够及时听取群众的意见，组织收购。六安县东方红农业社供销部，原来卖的是价值一元二角多一支的飞马牌钢笔，群众反映价钱太贵，就调换了五打六角六分一支的中南牌钢笔，几天之内就卖出三十四支。农业社提出了把铁锹的柄子改小、改细的意见，供销部照办以后，几天之内就把供销部运来的铁锹卖光。供销部能够及时地满足群众的购销要求，使群众十分满意。
    农业社和供销合作社对供销部采取双重领导的办法。农业社管供销部的购销计划和政治领导；供销合作社管业务（物资调拨、价格），财务（人员开支、盈亏负担）。这就从组织上把产、供、销的关系有效地结合起来。现在已经建立供销部的农业社，社员们都能集中精力去搞生产，要买的和要卖的，只要提出计划交供销部办理就行，不要再为买进卖出担心了。供销社也因为业务下伸到农业社，对收购、供应心里都有了谱，盲目调拨、盲目供应的偏向大为减少，真正做到物尽其用，货畅其流。这种办法，为改进商业工作提供了有利的条件。
