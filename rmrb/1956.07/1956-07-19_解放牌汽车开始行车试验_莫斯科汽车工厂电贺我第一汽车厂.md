Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, 18th. (Xinhua Reporter Kang Guozhi) The Liberation brand automobile, successfully trial-produced by the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant, began road tests on the 17th.

The reporter, along with the car driver conducting the tests, rode in this domestically produced car, passing through the city of Changchun and speeding along the winding, undulating dirt and gravel road between Changchun and Jilin City. The car proceeded at a speed of over twenty kilometers per hour, covering a total distance of 102 kilometers that day.

During the journey, the driver drove the car up a hillside with a gradient of nearly 30 degrees for a climbing test. The driver skillfully shifted gears, fully opened the throttle, and the car climbed through the grass to the top of the hill. According to local residents, no car had ever driven here before.

On the return journey to the factory, Liu Shaosen, an experienced driver who had driven over twenty different brands of cars from many countries, told the reporter that today's various tests showed that all parts of the car were in normal condition. He also said that the steering wheel and gear shift were very flexible, and the seat cushion was very soft, so he did not feel tired after driving more than 100 kilometers.

The tests that began on the 17th are break-in tests. After running 1,000 kilometers and checking the break-in condition of the car parts, dynamic performance, economic performance tests, and a special test – a destructive test – will be conducted. During the destructive test, the driver will wear a tanker's helmet and drive a fully loaded car at top speed on bumpy roads to test the car's structural design and the performance of various assemblies and parts.

These tests are expected to end in August. The quality of the Liberation brand automobile will be tested in these tests.

Xinhua News Agency, 18th. TASS, Moscow, 17th: All the employees of the Likhachev Automobile Factory in Moscow were very pleased to hear the news that the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant in Changchun, China, had produced the first batch of "Liberation" brand trucks. On July 16th, the factory's leadership, on behalf of all employees, sent a telegram from Moscow to Changchun, congratulating the Chinese automobile manufacturing factory on its significant production achievement.

The workers of the Moscow Automobile Factory are so happy because they have contributed to this achievement. They have manufactured many metal-cutting lathes, forging equipment, casting equipment, dies, molds, and various equipment for their Chinese friends. In addition, several hundred Chinese technicians have interned at this factory for three years.

    解放牌汽车开始行车试验
    莫斯科汽车工厂电贺我第一汽车厂
    新华社长春18日电　新华社记者康国志报道：第一汽车制造厂试制成功的解放牌汽车在十七日开始了行车试验。
    记者跟执行试验的汽车司机一起，坐上这辆国产汽车，穿过长春市区，奔驰在长春市—吉林市蜿蜒起伏的土石混合公路上。汽车以每小时二十多公里的速度前进，这一天共行驶了一百零二公里。
    在行驶中司机曾经把汽车开上一座坡度约近三十度的山岗，进行了一段爬坡试验。司机熟练地换上排挡，大开油门，汽车便穿过草丛爬到山顶。据当地居民说，过去这里从来没有走过汽车。
    在汽车返回工厂的途中，驾驶过许多国家出产的二十多种牌号汽车的老司机刘绍森对记者说，今天的各种试验表明，汽车的各个部分都处在正常状态中。他还说，汽车的方向盘和变速挡很灵活，坐垫也很柔软，因此汽车行驶了一百多公里，他并不感觉疲乏。
    十七日开始的试验是汽车走合试验。等走行一千公里，检查过汽车零件的磨合情况以后，还要进行汽车的动力性能、经济性能试验和一次特殊的试验——破坏性试验。在破坏性试验的时候，司机将戴上坦克手戴的帽子，驾驶满载的汽车，在坎坷不平的道路上用最高的速度向前猛冲，以便检验汽车结构设计和各种总成、零件的性能。
    这些试验预计在八月份结束。解放牌汽车的质量将在这些试验中受到各种考验。
    新华社18日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科十七日讯：莫斯科利哈乔夫汽车工厂的全体职工，在听到中国长春第一汽车制造厂出产了第一批“解放牌”载重汽车的消息以后，都感到十分高兴。七月十六日，工厂的领导机构代表全体职工从莫斯科给长春发了一份电报，祝贺中国汽车制造工厂所获得的重大生产成就。
    莫斯科汽车工厂的工人所以如此高兴，是因为他们曾经为这个成绩贡献出了一分力量。他们为中国朋友们制造了许多金属切削车床、锻压设备和翻砂设备、冲模、压模和各种设备。另外有几百名中国技术人员曾经在这个工厂进行了三年的实习。
