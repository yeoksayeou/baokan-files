Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, July 19th: The Vietnam News Agency reported on the 19th that the Foreign Minister of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, Pham Van Dong, wrote a letter to the French Foreign Minister, Pineau, on July 13th, stating: "According to the Geneva Accords, the French government has an obligation to contribute to the implementation of the Geneva Accords and the realization of free general elections to restore Vietnamese unity."

In his letter, Pham Van Dong requested the French government to fulfill its task and responsibility as a signatory to the Geneva Accords and to implement the recommendations made by the two chairmen of the Geneva Conference in their letter of May 8th to continue implementing the Geneva Accords.

Pham Van Dong said that, as far as Vietnam is concerned, the Geneva Accords were negotiated and signed by the representative of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the representative of the Government the French Republic, which represented both the Government of the French Republic and the Government of the State of Vietnam which later became the Government of the Republic of Vietnam. Article 27 of the Vietnam Agreement on the Cessation of Hostilities stipulates: "The signatories to this document and their successors in office shall be responsible for observing and implementing all the terms and provisions of this Agreement." Pham Van Dong pointed out, however, that the South Vietnamese authorities have stubbornly refused to hold consultative conferences. At the same time, the International Commission for Vietnam and the Vietnam Joint Armistice Commission have encountered many difficulties and obstacles in carrying out their tasks.

Pham Van Dong emphasized that the deadline stipulated by the Geneva Accords for the reunification of Vietnam through free general elections, namely July 1956, has arrived. However, the South Vietnamese authorities have not yet agreed to hold consultative conferences in accordance with the provisions of the Geneva Accords to discuss the issue of free general elections to reunify Vietnam. Therefore, the Geneva Accords have been seriously violated.

Pham Van Dong also pointed out that the correct implementation of the Geneva Accords will help further develop relations favorable to both Vietnam and France.

    范文同要法国履行日内瓦协定
    新华社河内19日电　据越南通讯社十九日讯：越南民主共和国外交部长范文同在七月十三日写信给法国外交部长比诺指出：“根据日内瓦协定，法国政府有义务对日内瓦协定的实施和对恢复越南统一的自由普选的实现作出贡献。”
    范文同在信中要求法国政府履行它作为日内瓦协定的一个签字国的任务和责任，并且贯彻日内瓦会议两位主席在五月八日的信件中所提出的继续执行日内瓦协定的建议。
    范文同说，就越南而论，日内瓦协定是由越南民主共和国政府代表同既代表法兰西共和国政府又代表后来成为越南共和国政府的越南国政府的法兰西共和国政府代表谈判缔结的。越南停止敌对行动协定第二十七条规定：“本文件签署人及其职务的继任人均应负责遵守并实施本协定的各项条款和规定。”范文同指出，但是，南越当局一直顽固地拒绝举行协商会议。同时，越南国际委员会和越南联合停战委员会在执行它们的任务的时候遭到了很多困难和阻碍。
    范文同强调说，日内瓦协定所规定的通过自由普选来重新统一越南的期限，即1956年7月已经到了。然而，南越当局却还没有同意按照日内瓦协定的规定举行协商会议来讨论自由普选以重新统一越南的问题。因此，日内瓦协定已经遭到了严重的违反。
    范文同并且指出，日内瓦协定的正确执行将有助于进一步发展有利于越法两国的关系。
