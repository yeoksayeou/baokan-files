    Striving to Overcome Difficulties of Steel and Cement Shortages
    Shenyang Construction Enterprises Save More Than 2,500 Tons of Cement
    (According to Shenyang Daily) Shenyang City's construction enterprises are working hard to save construction materials. From January to May this year, the city's capital construction departments saved more than 2,540 tons of cement. Six construction units saved more than 250 tons of steel.
    An important way to save cement this year is to adopt new technologies. The Northeast Second Engineering Company took the lead in promoting the experience of dry-hard concrete. Other units have also learned this method, which not only allows for quick form removal but also saves a lot of cement. The Third Engineering Department of the Northeast Second Engineering Company alone saved more than 1,400 tons of cement by using this method. There are also more than 20 advanced experiences such as using cement slurry for pointing and troweling concrete while pouring. Various units have also benefited from adopting these techniques. According to statistics from the First Engineering Department of the Northeast Second Engineering Company, the use of these methods saved a total of more than 890 tons of cement in two months.
    Capital construction workers have put forward many rationalization proposals for saving cement. Luo Yonghua of the Third Engineering Company of the city has developed a new concrete mix method to improve production. Many workers have also proposed using lime mixed with other materials to replace cement. The Third Engineering Company of the city uses fly ash, slag, and quicklime to make cement-free mortar, which can be used as bricklaying mortar below grade 50 and in places where low-grade concrete is needed. It is estimated that more than 500 tons of cement can be saved by the end of the year when the company's various construction sites adopt this method. The Second Construction Section of the Second Engineering Department of the Northeast Second Engineering Company saved more than 30 tons of cement just by using lime slag to replace grade 10 mixed mortar in eight construction projects.
    In terms of saving steel, according to statistics from the First, Second, and Third Engineering Departments of the Northeast Second Engineering Company, the Third and Fourth Engineering Companies of Shenyang City, and the Second Engineering Company of the Sixth Metallurgical Chemical Construction Corporation, as of the end of May, a total of more than 250 tons of steel have been saved for the country. It is estimated that 779 tons can be saved throughout the year, equivalent to more than 9% of the total annual consumption.
    Before the start of construction this year, these units formulated measures and plans to promote and learn various advanced experiences in saving steel. In the socialist competition, technicians and workers actively learned 27 advanced experiences in saving steel, such as cold-drawn cold-rolled steel bars, butt welding, and bamboo reinforced concrete. The First Engineering Department of the Northeast Second Engineering Company promoted various advanced experiences in saving steel in March and April, saving more than 50 tons of steel. The Third Engineering Department of this company saved 30 tons of steel by simply utilizing leftover materials. The Qu Mingren steel bar team of thirteen workers adopted methods such as cold-drawing steel bars, spot welding, butt welding, and unified material cutting, saving an average of 2.7 tons of steel per person by May. More than 70 steel bar workers in this department have also learned these methods.

    努力克服缺少钢材水泥的困难
    沈阳建筑企业节约水泥二千五百多吨
    据沈阳日报讯　沈阳市各建筑企业努力节约建筑材料。今年一至五月，全市基本建设部门节约水泥二千五百四十多吨。有六个施工单位节约了钢材二百五十多吨。
    今年节约水泥的一个重要途径是采用新技术。东北第二工程公司最先推广了干硬性混凝土经验，以后其他单位也都学习了这个方法，这就不仅拆模快，而且节省了大量水泥。仅东北第二工程公司第三工程处采用这个方法，就节省了水泥一千四百多吨。还有原浆抅缝、随打压光等二十多种先进经验，各单位采用以后也都有收获。据东北第二工程公司第一工程处的统计，两个月中使用这些方法共节省了八百九十多吨水泥。
    基本建设职工提出了不少节约水泥的合理化建议。市第三工程公司罗永华研究出提高制成量的混凝土新配合方法。还有不少职工提出用白灰混合其他材料代替水泥。市第三工程公司用炉灰、矿渣、生石灰做成无水泥沙浆，可以做五十号以下的砌砖沙浆和用在需要低标号混凝土的地方。经这个公司所属各工地采用，预计到年底可节省水泥五百多吨。东北第二工程公司第二工程处二工段，仅在八个工程项目上采用白灰炉渣代替十号混合沙浆，就节省了三十多吨水泥。
    在节约钢材方面，据东北第二工程公司第一、二、三工程处，沈阳市第三、四工程公司，第六冶金化学建筑总公司第二工程公司等单位统计，到五月底止，共给国家节省钢材二百五十多吨。预计全年可以节省七百七十九吨，相当全年使用量的9％以上。
    这些单位在今年开工前，都制定了推广和学习各种节约钢材先进经验的措施计划。在社会主义竞赛中，技术人员、工人都积极学习了冷拉冷扎钢筋、对头焊接、竹筋混凝土等二十七种节约钢材的先进经验。东北第二工程公司第一工程处三、四月份推广各种节约钢材的先进经验，节省五十多吨钢材。这个公司第三工程处仅利用残材一项就节约了三十吨钢材。曲明仁钢筋小组十三个工人，采用了冷拉钢筋、点焊、对头焊、统一下料等办法，到五月平均每人节省钢材二点七吨。这个处还有七十多个钢筋工，也都学习了这些办法。
