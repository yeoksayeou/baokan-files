　　Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, 9th: As the United Nations Disarmament Commission began its meeting in New York, many Indian newspapers published commentaries criticizing Western countries for attempting to obstruct the resolution of the disarmament issue. They also pointed out that the Soviet proposals were constructive.

　　The "Hindustan Standard" wrote: "Western countries have proposed reducing the level of armed forces in their suggestions in the past few years, but now that the Soviet Union has unilaterally reduced its own armed forces, there has been a new turning point in the discussion of the disarmament issue. These Western countries, however, are adamant that many disputed political issues, such as the German question, should be resolved first when discussing the solution to the disarmament issue. This puts the disarmament issue in a state of prolonged deadlock."

　　The "Amrita Bazar Patrika" said, "We must not allow the clear Soviet proposal to immediately ban atomic and hydrogen weapons to be delayed due to the consistent opposition of the United States and Britain."

    印报指责西方国家阻挠裁军
    新华社10日讯　据塔斯社新德里九日讯：当联合国裁军委员会开始在纽约开会的时候，印度许多报纸发表评论，批评西方国家企图阻挠解决裁军问题。它们并且指出，苏联的建议是建设性的。
    “印度斯坦旗报”写道：“西方国家曾经在过去几年的建议中提出裁减武装力量的水平，但是现在苏联已经单方面裁减了自己的武装力量，裁军问题的讨论有了新的转机，这些西方国家却坚决主张在讨论解决裁军问题时首先应当解决许多争执中的政治问题，如德国问题。这样就使裁军问题陷入持久的僵局”。
    “甘露市场报”说，“决不能容许由于美英一贯表示反对而把苏联要求立即禁止原子武器和氢武器的明确建议拖延下去”。
