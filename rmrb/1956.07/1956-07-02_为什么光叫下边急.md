Why are we always urging those below to hurry?

Since the beginning of this year, among the 82 official documents issued by the Civil Affairs Department of Zhejiang Province, 45 are always marked "urgent." They are either labeled "express mail," "top express mail," "urgent document," or "top urgent document."

However, the Civil Affairs Department of Zhejiang Province is always unhurried when dealing with requests from lower levels. No matter how urgent the lower levels are, it always takes its time. Take Lishui County as an example. For instance, in early March, the Civil Affairs Section of Lishui County wrote a report requesting approval to take in some demobilized soldiers. A month passed without a single word in response. Anxious, the lower level sent a supplementary report to urge action, but another two months passed, and it was still like a stone sinking into the sea, with no news at all.

Another example is that Lishui County decided to hold a meeting of model veterans on March 23rd. As early as late February, they wrote to the Civil Affairs Department to request certificates of merit and good news reports. They did not receive them, so they wrote again on March 13th to urge them to be sent. They waited eagerly, but they still didn't receive them. They were only sent on March 25th, after the meeting had already ended. It really makes people wonder why the Civil Affairs Department of Zhejiang Province is always urging those below to "hurry" while it is always slow. (Attached picture)

    为什么光叫下边急
    今年以来，浙江省民政厅下达的八十二件公文，有四十五件总是“急”，不是标着“速件”“最速件”，就是标着“急件”“特急件”的字样。
    可是，浙江省民政厅对下级的请示却老是不慌不忙，不管下边多急，它总处之泰然。以丽水县为例，比如三月初，丽水县民政科写了一个报告，要求批准收容一些复员军人，过了一个月，不见只字答复。下边着急之下，又补了一个报告去催，可是，又过了两个多月，仍如石沉大海，音讯毫无。
    再如丽水县决定在三月二十三日召开优抚模范会议，还在二月下旬就写信向民政厅要奖状、要喜报，不见发下来，又于三月十三日写信去催，望眼欲穿，还不见发下来，到三月二十五日会议已经结束，才发下来。真使人不懂，为什么浙江省民政厅光叫下边“急”，而自己总是慢腾腾的呢？（附图片）
