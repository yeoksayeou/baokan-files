    锡兰即同中苏研究建交问题
    班达拉奈克说锡兰政府代表团八月间出发
    新华社新德里19日电　科伦坡消息：锡兰总理班达拉奈克在七月十八日举行的每周记者招待会上说，锡兰政府将在八月间派遣政府代表团前往苏联和中国，以便研究同这两个国家建立外交关系的可能性。
    这个代表团将由锡兰驻伦敦高级专员柯里亚、国防部和外交部驻国会秘书苏巴辛格和财政部助理秘书科马拉斯瓦米组成。代表团将首先访问莫斯科，然后再到北京。
    班达拉奈克还说，他打算出席今年十一月在纽约召开的联合国大会开幕会议，并且将在这个会议上讲话。
    他还宣布，英国首相艾登已经接受他的邀请，将在今年冬天访问锡兰。他说，关于锡兰不久将派代表团去英国讨论有关英国在锡兰的基地的这个问题，他正等待英国的进一步的通知。
    这位总理还谈到了英美一家石油联合企业要求在锡兰开办炼油厂的问题。他说锡兰政府拒绝了这家企业联营组织的建议，因为这家企业提出的条件有点苛刻。
    他又说，他的政府还没有最后拒绝关于建立炼油厂的建议，他们正在进一步研究这个建议。
