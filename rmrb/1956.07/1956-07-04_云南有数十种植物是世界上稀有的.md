Yunnan has dozens of plant species that are rare in the world
    (Our newspaper's report) The Kunming Work Station of the Institute of Botany of the Chinese Academy of Sciences has conducted a relatively comprehensive survey of plants in Yunnan. The number of plant species in Yunnan accounts for more than 50% of the country. Many ancient plants have been preserved due to Yunnan's complex terrain, tropical, temperate, and frigid climates, and the fact that it was not affected by glacial invasions. Dozens of Yunnan's plants are rare in the world. In order to better carry out scientific research, the Kunming Work Station will be expanded into the Kunming Institute of Biology. The more than 30 mu botanical garden established by the Kunming Work Station will be expanded to 1,200 mu this year.

    云南有数十种植物是世界上稀有的
    本报讯　中国科学院植物研究所昆明工作站已对云南的植物作了比较普遍的调查。云南植物的种数占全国的50％以上。许多古代植物因云南地形复杂，热带、温带、寒带性气候，而且没有受到冰河的侵入，都保留了下来。云南的植物，在世界是稀有的就有数十种。为了更好的展开科学研究工作，昆明工作站将扩大为昆明生物研究所。昆明工作站所建立起来的30多亩植物园，今年将扩大为1，200亩。
