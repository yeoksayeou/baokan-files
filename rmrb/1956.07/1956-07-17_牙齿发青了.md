    Teeth Turned Blue
    Recently, we each spent 44 cents to buy a tube of "Zhonghua Toothpaste," produced by the Shanghai Fuxin Toothpaste Factory. The price can be considered high, but the quality of the toothpaste is very poor. People always say that brushing teeth with good toothpaste makes them whiter, but when we brush our teeth with Zhonghua brand toothpaste, our teeth turn blue. Other comrades in our office who use this toothpaste have also had their teeth turn blue. We hope that the Shanghai Fuxin Toothpaste Factory will quickly inspect and rectify this.
                                                                                (Shen Endi Liang Fu)

    牙齿发青了
    最近，我们每人花了四角四分钱买一支“中华牙膏”，这是上海福新行牙膏厂的出品。价钱不能不算高，可是牙膏的质量却很坏。从来人家都说用好牙膏刷牙，越刷越洁白，我们用中华牌牙膏刷牙，牙齿都变成青色的了。我们机关里使用这种牙膏的其它同志，牙齿也都变青色了。希望上海福新行牙膏厂迅速检查改正。	　　（沈恩棣　梁福）
