Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, July 13th. Bi Caisheng, a seaman who returned from the United States two months ago, took up his new post yesterday as a crew member on the "Peace No. 21" vessel.

Yesterday morning, the crew members of this coastal freighter gathered in the ship's hall to warmly welcome him.

Bi Caisheng told Xinhua News Agency reporters on board that in the past seventeen years, he had worked as a crew member on British, Panamanian, and Norwegian ships, and eventually ended up in the United States. He stayed there for nine years and could not find the maritime work he loved. He had to work as a temporary waiter in restaurants, hotels, and bars, living a semi-unemployed life.

From last November to now, sixty-two seamen who have returned from abroad have been assigned work by the Shanghai Maritime Administration to participate in transportation on the Shanghai-Dalian sea route. Dai Liren, the former captain of the British ship "Oriental Dragon," is now the captain of China's largest coastal freighter, the "Zhongxing No. 1." Others have taken up positions as chief engineers, chief mates, sailors, etc.

    在海外流浪十七年的毕财生参加祖国航运工作
    新华社上海13日电　两个月前从美国回国的海员毕财生，在昨天走上他的新岗位，到“和平二十一号”轮担任船员。
    昨天上午，这艘沿海货轮的船员们，聚集在轮船大厅里，热烈地欢迎了他。
    毕财生在船上对新华社记者说，在过去的十七年里，他曾经做过英国、巴拿马、挪威等国轮船上的船员，最后到了美国。他在那里待了九年，怎样也找不到自己热爱的海上工作，只好在餐厅、旅馆、酒吧间做临时招待生，过着半失业的生活。
    从去年十一月到现在，已经有六十二名从国外回来的海员由上海海运管理局分配了工作，参加上海—大连海运线上的运输。原任英国“东方之龙”号轮船船长的戴力人，现在是中国沿海最大的货轮——中兴一号的船长，其他人也分别担任了轮机长、大副、水手等。
