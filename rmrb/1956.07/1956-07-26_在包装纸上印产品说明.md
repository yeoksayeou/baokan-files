	Print Product Information on Packaging

	Customers often ask us a series of questions when they come to buy soap: Which soap is good? Why is it good? What color is it? What kind of fragrance does it have, etc. However, we don't know the answers to these many questions. Customers cannot understand the quality of the soap from us, and they can't open the soap's packaging to take a look, so they can't choose the soap they like, and they have to buy one haphazardly.

	We once considered opening one of each type of soap as a sample, but we thought that this would cause a great loss because without the packaging, it could not be sold at the original price.

	Recently, the Xinhua Sandalwood Soap and Renren Soap that we received here have simple descriptions printed on the packaging, including the fatty acid content, soap weight, and color. We think this is very good. Not only can consumers understand the soap, but it can also help sales staff become familiar with various soaps, making it easier to introduce and sell them to customers. We suggest that all soap factories print detailed and easy-to-understand product descriptions on the packaging.

    在包装纸上印产品说明
    顾客来买香皂，常常向我们提出一连串的问题：什么香皂好？为什么好？是什么颜色的？香味又是什么香等等。可是这许多问题我们全都不知道。顾客不能从我们这里了解香皂的好坏，想把香皂的纸拆开看看又不行，因而无法挑选自己喜爱的香皂，只好马马虎虎买一块就算了。
    我们曾考虑过把每种香皂都拆开一个作样品，但又想到这样会造成很大的损失，因为去了包装纸就不能按原价出售了。
    最近我们这里新到的新华檀香皂和人人香皂包装纸上都印有简单的说明，包括脂肪酸的含量，香皂重量和色别等。我们认为这样做很好。不但能让消费者了解香皂，而且可以帮助业务员熟悉各种香皂，便于向顾客介绍推销。建议各生产香皂的工厂都在包装纸上加印详细而通俗的产品说明。
