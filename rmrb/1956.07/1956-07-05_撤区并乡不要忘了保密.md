    Don't Forget Secrecy When Abolishing Districts and Merging Townships

    Editor:
    In late May, I went to Cixi and Yuyao counties to understand the work of cleaning up and keeping files and archives during the abolition of districts and merging of townships. I found that in some places, file keeping was very chaotic. In Yuyao, one district piled up more than 20 internal Party documents marked with "Top Secret" and "Confidential," such as the "Joint Notice on the Allocation of District-Level Cadres" from the County Party Committee Organization Department and the County People's Committee Personnel Section and the "Request for Instructions from the Provincial Party Committee on Chairman Mao's Report on Agricultural Cooperativization," in two cabinets without doors; some internal documents were even thrown into the toilet to be used as toilet paper.
    In Cixi County, Shiqiao, Puzhong and other three townships also lost a lot of documents sent down by higher authorities. In Mingshan Township, Cixi County, in order to reduce the "trouble" of moving during the township merger, they burned all the township's documents and materials without asking for approval from the relevant departments at higher levels.
    In order to preserve the archives and materials of the Party and the state completely and undamaged, and to ensure state secrets and prevent bad elements from exploiting our loopholes, it is hoped that all localities will earnestly do a good job in cleaning up and keeping the files and archives during the abolition of districts and merging of townships.

    撤区并乡不要忘了保密
    编辑同志：
    五月下旬，我去慈溪、余姚二县了解撤区并乡中的文件、档案清理和保管工作，发现有的地方文件保管非常混乱。余姚有一个区把县委组织部和县人民委员会人事科“关于配备区级干部的联合通知”、“省委讨论毛主席关于农业合作化问题的请示报告”等二十多件注有“绝密”“机密”字样的党内文件，都堆在两只没有门的橱里；还有些内部文件竟被丢在厕所里做大便纸了。
    慈溪县的师桥、浦中等三个乡，把上级发下去的文件也丢失了不少。慈溪县鸣山乡，为了减少并乡时搬家的“麻烦”，也不经请示上级有关部门批准，就擅自把全乡文件、资料一齐烧毁了。
    为了把党和国家的档案材料完整无损的保存下来，并确保国家机密，防止坏分子钻我们的空子，希望各地认真做好撤区并乡中间的文件、档案的清理和保管工作。
