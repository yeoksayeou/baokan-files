    Capitalist Countries
    Money is Becoming Less and Less Valuable
    Xinhua News Agency, 6th Dispatch from New York: According to the 1956 edition of "Pick's Currency Yearbook," the currencies of fifty-three capitalist countries have devalued significantly in recent years. This yearbook measures the degree of currency devaluation by the extent to which the cost of living has risen in capitalist countries. According to the yearbook, from 1946 to 1955, the US dollar devalued by 17%, the Italian lira by 24%, the British pound by 35%, the French franc by 66%, the Japanese yen by 67%, the Bolivian boliviano by 95%, and the South Korean won by 99%.
    The "Newsweek" in its end-of-June issue, under the title "The Great Squeeze," published a frank commentary on this situation, saying, "We are in an era of inflation." Many governments rely on inflation to maintain economic activity. Once inflation occurs, some powerful special interests demand that it continue. Some groups "benefit at the expense of all other residents." "Inflation is the most cruel and most relentless tax." This American magazine admits that inflation harms ordinary people and benefits large corporations. It says that the government is "astonishingly exploiting its people" through "deliberately created inflation or credit expansion."

    资本主义国家
    货币越来越不值钱
    新华社6日讯　纽约消息：据1956年的毕克斯货币年鉴报道，五十三个资本主义国家的货币在最近几年大大贬值。这个年鉴用资本主义国家生活费用上涨的程度来衡量货币贬值的多少。据年鉴说，从1946年到1955年，美元贬值了17％，意大利里拉贬值了24％，英镑贬值了35％，法郎贬值了66％，日圆贬值了67％，玻利维亚货币玻利维阿诺贬值了95％，南朝鲜圜贬值了99％。
    六月底一期的“新闻周刊”在“巨大的榨取”题目下，对这种情况发表了一篇坦白的评论说，“我们正处在通货膨胀的时代”。许多政府都依赖通货膨胀来维持经济活动。而通货膨胀一旦发生，一些有力量的特殊势力就要求它继续下去。一些集团“在使所有其他居民遭受损失的情况下得到好处。“通货膨胀是一种最残忍的和最漫无止境的税”。这家美国杂志承认，通货膨胀是使普通人民受害，而使大公司得益的。它说，政府是通过“蓄意制造的通货膨胀或者信用膨胀”“对自己的人民进行惊人的榨取”。
