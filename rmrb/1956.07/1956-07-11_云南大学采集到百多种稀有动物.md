Xinhua News Agency Report:

    Yunnan University's biological collection team recently collected more than one hundred kinds of rare animals in Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture and other places.

    In Mengyang and other places in Banna, they captured three great hornbills. This bird lives by eating the fruit of banyan trees, has a double crest that is yellowish-beige, and a beak that is 27.5 centimeters long. The local Dai people call it the "big-beaked bird." They also caught an animal resembling a bear on the border between China and Burma, but its waist was much thinner and longer than that of a common bear, and it had a long tail that ordinary bears do not have. Yunnan University is preparing to ask the Chinese Academy of Sciences to name this animal. A flying lizard caught in Ganlanba is rarely seen in China. It looks like a lizard but has two wings and can glide short distances from high places.

    These rare animals have already been, or are in the process of being, made into specimens at Yunnan University.

    In addition, the Department of Biology of Yunnan University is currently classifying, sorting, and preparing specimens of dozens of other domestically rare animals, such as the Lancang giant lizard, fairy pitta, tree duck, slow loris, raccoon, large python, and monitor lizard.

    云南大学采集到百多种稀有动物
    新华社讯　云南大学生物采集组不久前在西双版纳傣族自治州等地采集到了一百多种稀有动物。
    他们在版纳勐养等地捉到了三只大犀鸟。这种鸟靠吃大青树果生活，有米黄色的双冠，嘴长二十七点五公分，当地傣族人民叫做大嘴雀。他们还在中、缅交界处捉到了一种形状像熊的动物，但腰部比常见的熊要细长得多，并且有一条普通熊所没有的长尾巴。云南大学准备请中国科学院为这种动物定名。在橄榄坝捉到的一只飞蜥，在中国很少见到。它像蜥蜴，但有两只翅膀，能从高处进行短距离的滑翔飞行。
    这些稀有动物都已经或正在云南大学制成标本。
    此外，云南大学生物系正在分类整理和制作标本的，还有澜沧大?、八色?、树鸭、懒猴、浣熊、大蟒、巨蜥等几十种国内罕见的动物。
