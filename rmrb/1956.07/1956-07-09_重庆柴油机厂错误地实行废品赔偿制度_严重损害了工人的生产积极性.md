Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, July 7th. The Chongqing Diesel Engine Plant's erroneous implementation of a defective product compensation system and arbitrary deduction of workers' wages have seriously damaged the workers' enthusiasm for production and labor, causing adverse consequences for the entire factory's production. This matter was exposed in yesterday's Chongqing Daily.

Last October, the Chongqing Diesel Engine Plant formulated a "Detailed Rules for Compensation for Defective Products by Production Workers," which stipulated that not only should workers' wages be deducted for defective products caused by violations of labor discipline and operating procedures, but also that generally scrapped products must be compensated for. In the process of implementing the above rules, they mistakenly included defective products caused by improper labor organization, erroneous technical guidance, or other factors in the workers' accounts.

From January to May this year, apart from 5% of auxiliary workers, the remaining 95% of production workers in the foundry workshop had their wages deducted due to defective products. In the metalworking workshop, in the highest month this year, 70.9% of production workers had their wages deducted because of defective products; the most someone had to compensate was more than 300 yuan, and the least was even one cent. After the foundry workshop changed the composition of the molding sand in April, the administrative side did not allow the workers to change the operating methods accordingly, resulting in a large number of scrapped castings, but the factory still deducted the wages of the molding workers indiscriminately. Because the management work in this workshop was unsound, sometimes defective products produced by the previous shift were deducted from the wages of the next shift; sometimes the defective products had already been recycled, but the deducted wages were not returned to the workers.

This erroneous method of arbitrarily deducting workers' wages made experienced workers unwilling to take on apprentices, fearing that they would be implicated if the apprentices produced defective products. The advanced experience of various workshops could not be promoted. The workers in the foundry workshop said: "We are afraid to promote advanced experience because we can't afford to compensate if it results in scrapped products!" Among the nine lathe operators in the machine repair workshop, four were afraid of producing defective products and did not dare to promote the high-speed cutting method. Because they were constantly worried about scrapping and deducting money, the workers rarely paid attention to the advanced producer movement, and some even said: "It's good enough not to produce defective products, why bother being an advanced producer!"

The compensation system also affected the unity between workers, engineering and technical personnel, and administrative cadres, with people blaming each other and shirking responsibility when defective products were produced.

The implementation of this system by the Chongqing Diesel Engine Plant not only failed to achieve its goal of "improving product quality, reducing losses from defective products, and strengthening the operator's sense of responsibility for cherishing state property," but instead brought adverse consequences to production. Since March this year, the factory has failed to fully meet the targets set by the state plan for four consecutive months. The total output value for the first half of the year was only 28.7% of the annual plan, and the phenomenon of scrapping became more and more serious.

The Chongqing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China recently sent a working group to help the factory's Party Committee conduct an inspection, pointing out that the Chongqing Diesel Engine Plant's erroneous practice seriously violated the Party's policy of relying on the working class to do a good job in production. This attempt to simply achieve good production by punishing workers is actually a reflection of capitalist management concepts and methods in the minds of some leading cadres in the factory. The Municipal Committee has ordered the factory to immediately correct this error and learn from this mistake to improve its work.

The "Chongqing Daily" pointed out in its editorial published on July 6 that the Chongqing Diesel Engine Plant's error had not been corrected for a long time, which was inseparable from the dictatorial work style of individual administrative leaders in the factory; at the same time, it also exposed the serious shortcomings of the factory's Party organization in political and ideological work. For such an obviously erroneous method, the factory's Party Committee neither seriously discussed it beforehand nor reported it to the higher Party Committee for instructions afterwards, but it was adopted due to the insistence of individual administrative leaders. The masses had opinions about this erroneous method from the beginning, and these opinions became more and more numerous later on. The chairman of the trade union had repeatedly reported these situations to the Party Committee and the factory director, but the Party Committee had never paid attention to and stopped it, which shows that the collective leadership of the factory's Party Committee was very poor.

### 重庆柴油机厂错误地实行废品赔偿制度  严重损害了工人的生产积极性

    重庆柴油机厂错误地实行废品赔偿制度
    严重损害了工人的生产积极性
    新华社重庆7日电　重庆柴油机厂错误地实行废品赔偿制度、滥扣工人的工资，严重地损害了工人的生产积极性和劳动热情，对整个工厂的生产造成了不良的后果。这件事是在昨天的重庆日报上揭发出来的。
    去年十月份，重庆柴油机厂制定了一个“生产工人废品赔偿细则”，其中不仅规定因违反劳动纪律和操作规程所造成的废品，要扣除工人的工资，还规定一般报废的产品也必须赔偿。在执行以上细则的过程中，他们更错误地把因劳动组织不当、技术指导错误或其他因素产生的废品，一起算在工人的帐上。
    今年一到五月份，铸工车间除了5％的辅助工人以外，其余95％的生产工人都因出废品被扣过工资。金工车间今年最高的一个月份，也有70.9％的生产工人因为产生废品被扣了工资；最多的一个人竟赔偿到三百多元，最少连一分钱也要扣除。铸工车间四月份改变型砂成份以后，由于行政方面不准许工人相应地改变操作方法，致使铸件大量报废，但是厂方仍然不加分别地扣除了造型工人的工资。这个车间因为管理工作不健全，有时候上一班工人出了废品却扣了下一班工人的工资；有时候废品已经想办法回用了，却不给工人发还被扣掉的工资。
    这种滥扣工人工资的错误办法，使老师傅不愿带徒弟，害怕徒弟出了废品自己受到牵累。各个车间的先进经验始终推广不起来，铸工车间的工人们说：“我们怕推广先进经验报废了赔不起！”机修车间九个车工当中，就有四个人怕出废品不敢推广高速切削法。由于成天耽心的是报废、扣钱，工人们对先进生产者运动很少过问，有的甚至说：“不出废品就是好的，还当什么先进生产者！”
    赔偿制度也影响到工人和工程技术人员，以及行政干部之间的团结，出了废品互相埋怨，推卸责任。
    重庆柴油机厂实行这种制度不仅没有达到他们“提高产品质量、减少废品损失、加强操作者爱护国家财产的责任感”的目的，反而给生产带来了不良的后果。从今年三月份以来，这个工厂连续四个月都没有全面达到国家计划规定的指标，生产总值上半年只完成全年计划的28.7％，报废现象也越来越严重。
    中共重庆市委员会最近派工作组帮助这个厂的党委进行了检查，指出重庆柴油机厂的这种错误做法，严重违反了党依靠工人阶级搞好生产的方针。这种企图单纯通过惩罚工人来达到搞好生产的办法，实际上是资本主义经营管理的观点和方法在这个厂的某些领导干部身上的反映。市委已经责令这个厂立即纠正这种错误，并且从这次错误中吸取教训，改进工作。
    “重庆日报”在七月六日发表的社论中指出，重庆柴油机厂的错误长期没有得到纠正，是与这个厂的个别行政领导干部独断专行的作风分不开的；同时，也暴露了这个厂的党组织政治思想工作方面的严重缺点。对于这样一种显然是错误的办法，厂的党委会事先既没有认真讨论，事后也没有向上级党委报告请示，而是由于个别行政领导干部的坚持而被通过的。群众对这种错误的办法，一开始就有意见，而且在后来意见越来越多。工会主席曾经几次向党委会和厂长反映过这些情况，但党委会始终没有加以重视和制止，这就说明了这个厂党委会的集体领导是很差的。
