    Jiangxi Overfulfills Wheat Procurement Plan
    (Our Dispatch) As of the end of June, Jiangxi Province's wheat storage accounted for 120% of the unified purchase task, and barley storage accounted for 150% of the unified purchase task. This is the year with the largest procurement volume in history.
    The reason why Jiangxi Province's wheat procurement plan was overfulfilled this year is mainly due to the unprecedented bumper harvest of wheat and barley. The province's total wheat output increased by 48% compared with last year, and the yield per unit area increased by 23%; the total barley output increased by 30% compared with last year, and the yield per unit area increased by 19%. Therefore, farmers' ability to sell has increased. For example, Yushan County failed to complete its unified wheat purchase task last year. This year, due to an increase of three million jin in production, it overfulfilled the task. On the other hand, many newly established agricultural cooperatives this year have neglected sideline production, and members once experienced a shortage of cash, which expanded the commodity nature of wheat and barley. In addition, encouraged by the "increased production without increased procurement" policy, agricultural cooperatives in various places actively sold surplus wheat after reserving enough seeds per mu and enough wheat for consumption by the members. After the wheat was sold, it not only solved the living difficulties of the members during the summer famine, but also expanded the investment in agricultural and sideline production.

### 江西收购小麦计划超额完成

    江西收购小麦计划超额完成
    本报讯　江西省截至六月底，全省小麦入库占统购任务120％，大麦入库占统购任务150％。这是历史上收购数量最多的一年。
    今年江西收购小麦计划能够超额完成的原因，主要是大、小麦获得了空前的丰收。全省小麦总产量较去年增加了48％，单位面积产量增加了23％；大麦总产量较去年增加了30％，单位面积产量增加了19％。因此，农民的出售能力提高了。如玉山县去年小麦统购任务没有完成，今年由于增产了三百万斤，便超额完成了任务。另一方面，今年很多新建的农业社，忽视了副业生产，社员曾一度发生缺乏现金的困难，这样就扩大了大、小麦的商品性，加之“增产不增购”政策的鼓舞，各地农业社按亩留足种籽、按社员需要留足食用的麦子后，积极出售余麦。麦子售出后，不仅解决了社员夏荒时期的生活困难，而且扩大了农、副业的生产投资。
