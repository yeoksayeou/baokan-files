    Such Grading is Unreasonable
    After I joined the Chengdu City Transfer and Construction Committee in February 1955, the Personnel Department of the Chengdu City People's Committee determined my grade to be level 25. This means that a person who served in the army for nearly five years and was once a deputy platoon leader is treated the same as a junior high school graduate who has just started working, or even lower than some newly employed middle school students!
    Recently, I heard that the Chengdu City Transfer and Construction Committee had raised the issue of my grade with the Personnel Department of the Chengdu City People's Committee. However, it is said that the Personnel Department still believes that I should be graded as a new employee. How strange! The State Council's resolution clearly stipulates that: demobilized and construction soldiers participating in the work of institutions and organizations should be appropriately considered for their original rank in the army when assigning work and determining salary treatment, and their military service should be counted as working history... Why is the State Council's resolution not being implemented here?

    这样定级不合理
    1955年2月我到成都市转业建设委员会参加工作以后，成都市人民委员会人事处把我的级别确定为二十五级。这就是说，一个在部队中服务了将近五年曾经是副排级的人员，和刚参加工作的初中毕业学生一样，甚至还低于个别新参加工作的中学生哩！
    最近听说成都市转业建设委员会曾经向成都市人民委员会人事处提出过我的级别问题，可是据说人事处还认为应该把我当作新参加工作的人员来评级。真奇怪！国务院的决议明明规定：对参加机关、团体工作的复员建设军人，在分配工作、确定薪金待遇时应适当照顾到他们原在部队的级别，其军龄应当算做参加工作的历史……。为什么国务院的决议在这里不能贯彻执行？
