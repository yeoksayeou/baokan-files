    Hurry Up and Purchase Rapeseed
    Cao Shitang
    This year, the rapeseed purchasing tasks in many regions have not been completed well. According to statistics from the China Oils and Fats Company, only 56.42% of the national purchasing plan had been completed by the beginning of July.
    The poor rapeseed purchasing situation this year is mainly due to the underestimation of production in some areas, which believed that rapeseed production would decrease this year. For example, Liangshui Township in Wanxian County, Sichuan Province, originally estimated that the whole township could harvest 47,000 jin of rapeseed after the reduction in production, but the actual output reached more than 73,000 jin, with the actual output exceeding the estimated output by 63.74%. In Jiangsu Province, except for a few areas with faster purchasing progress, half of the rapeseed is still in the hands of agricultural cooperatives. For example, in Nanqiao District of Fengxian County, the actual rapeseed production is 1.22 million jin, but only 270,000 jin have been purchased so far, accounting for only 22% of the actual production.
      The bureaucratic rules and regulations and the passive business style of waiting for customers also affected the completion of the purchasing tasks. For example, purchasing points in Nanjiang and Peng County, Sichuan Province, stipulated that "small quantities will not be purchased, those not organized will not be purchased, and purchases will not be made when it rains," and some only made purchases during market days. Yanling County, Henan Province, believed that rapeseed production was small and dispersed, so it did not arrange rapeseed purchasing work, resulting in many rapeseeds not finding a way out, and finally being used as fertilizer on the land.
    The main reason for the lack of enthusiasm in purchasing is that, on the one hand, many areas only saw the favorable factors of farmers being able to collectively sell after agricultural cooperativization and relaxed their subjective efforts, and did not make active arrangements for the organization of purchasing; on the other hand, some grassroots supply and marketing cooperative cadres were unclear about the actual output of the local area, and emphasized the reduction in production, thus losing confidence. Whether the task of unified rapeseed purchasing can be completed has reached a decisive stage, and completing the task of unified rapeseed purchasing is related to the food consumption of the people of the whole country. Therefore, the purchasing units in charge of various regions must, under the leadership of the Party and government departments, take effective measures promptly in light of the specific circumstances of the local area, check the problems existing in the past work, improve the purchasing methods, and strive to complete this year's rapeseed purchasing task on the principle of correctly implementing policies and facilitating farmers' sales.

### 赶紧收购菜籽

    赶紧收购菜籽
    曹师棠
    今年很多地区的菜籽收购任务完成不好。据中国油脂公司统计，到七月上旬止，全国仅完成收购计划的56.42％。
    今年菜籽收购情况不好，主要是部分地区认为今年菜籽减产，估产偏低。四川万县凉水乡原估计减产后全乡可收菜籽四万七千斤，实际产量却达到七万三千多斤，实产超过估产的63.74％。江苏省除少数地区收购进度较快外，目前尚有半数菜籽在农业社手里未售，如奉贤县南桥区实产菜籽122万斤，但现在仅收进27万斤，出售量仅占实产的22％。
      商业工作中的清规戒律和等客上门的经营作风，也影响了收购任务的完成。像四川南江、彭县等地收购点规定“数量小不收，未组织起来不收，天下雨不收”，有的是逢场才收。河南省鄢陵县认为菜籽产量小地区分散，就没有布置菜籽收购工作，结果很多菜籽找不到出路，最后变成了肥料上地。
    收购不积极的主要原因，一方面是由于不少地区只看到了农业合作化以后，农民可以集体交售的有利因素，放松了主观上的努力，对收购的组织工作未作积极的安排；另方面是部分基层供销社干部对当地实际产量心中无数，而且强调减产，因此失去信心。菜籽统购任务的能否完成，已经到了决定性的阶段，而完成菜籽统购任务，关系到全国人民的食用。因此，各地负责收购单位，必须在党政部门的领导下，针对当地具体情况，迅速采取有效措施，检查过去工作中存在的问题，改进收购方法，在正确贯彻政策便利农民交售的原则下，争取完成今年菜籽的收购任务。
