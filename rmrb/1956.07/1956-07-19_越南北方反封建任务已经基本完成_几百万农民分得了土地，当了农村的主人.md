    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 18th. A communique was released today by the Council of Ministers of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam announcing that the anti-feudal task in northern Vietnam has been basically completed, the landlord class has been overthrown, and millions of peasants have been granted land and become masters of the countryside.
    The communique stated that after listening to the report on the fifth phase of land reform, the Council of Ministers believes that, together with the achievements of the previous phases of land reform, the Vietnamese people have achieved great and fundamental victory; this victory will play an important role in consolidating the North and realizing the struggle for a unified country.
    The fifth phase of land reform in Vietnam was carried out in 1,732 villages with a population of over six million. According to incomplete statistics, in this phase of land reform, a total of more than 376,700 hectares of land, more than 40,700 head of cattle, more than 1,138,478 pieces of farm equipment, and 9,717 tons of grain were confiscated, requisitioned, and purchased from landlords, and landlords were forced to return 16,032 tons of rent grain. All of this has been distributed to more than 4,679,000 landless or land-poor peasants and poor people. The victory of this phase of land reform has basically completed the task of anti-feudal struggle in the northern plains and the middle reaches of the Red River, and the feudal forces in the North have been eliminated forever.
    Since April 1954, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has completed land reform in more than 3,200 villages with a population of 10.3 million. In the land reform, a total of 7,890,000 peasants received 690,000 hectares of land, more than 104,000 head of cattle, and more than 1,840,000 pieces of farm equipment, accounting for more than half of the current population of the North.
    In the future, land reform will continue in some ethnic minority areas, mountainous areas, and coastal areas where land reform has not yet been carried out, and areas where land reform has been completed will be reviewed.

    越南北方反封建任务已经基本完成
    几百万农民分得了土地，当了农村的主人
    新华社河内18日电　越南民主共和国部长会议今天发表公报，宣布越南北方反封建任务已经基本完成，地主阶级已经被打倒，几百万农民已经分得了土地和当了农村的主人。
    公报说，部长会议听取了关于第五期土地改革的报告后，认为，加上前几期的土地改革的成就，越南人民已经获得了巨大的和根本的胜利；这个胜利将对巩固北方和实现统一国家的斗争起重要的作用。
    越南的第五期土地改革是在拥有六百多万人口的一千七百三十二个乡进行的。据不完全的统计，在这期土地改革中，共没收、征收和征购了地主的土地三十七万六千七百多公顷、耕牛四万零七百多头、农具一百一十三万八千四百七十八件、粮食九千七百一十七吨，并且迫使地主退还租粮一万六千零三十二吨。所有这一切都分配给了四百六十七万九千多个无地或少地的农民和贫民。这一期土地改革的胜利，基本上完成了北方平原地区和红河中游地区的反封建的斗争任务，使北方的封建势力永远地消灭了。
    从1954年4月份以来越南民主共和国已经在拥有一千零三十万人口的三千二百多个乡完成了土地改革。在土地改革中，共有七百八十九万农民分到了六十九万公顷土地、十万四千多头耕牛和一百八十四万多件农具，他们占目前北方人口的一半以上。
    今后，还没有进行土地改革的部分少数民族地区、山区和沿海地区将继续进行土地改革，已经完成土地改革的地区将进行复查。
