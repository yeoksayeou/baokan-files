From the Readers

    Publish More Reference Books
    "If a workman wants to do a good job, he must first sharpen his tools." This is an old saying. Recently, I have deeply felt the truth of this saying.
    I myself am a student of literature, and I often want to do some research work, but I am often stopped because I lack the "tools."
    Up to now, our reference books are still "old relics." The only usable and most common reference books are still the "Cihai" and "Ciyuan" compiled around the time of the War of Resistance. Some of these books have errors in their content, such as describing Li Zicheng as a "bandit." Others are word games in their explanations, such as mutual annotations like "A is B, and B is A." More specialized reference books are even scarcer. For example, there is no relatively complete and accurate dictionary of social and political sciences, nor is there a literary dictionary that people can understand. It is no wonder that some young literary enthusiasts have to carry a small notebook with them, extracting noun explanations from literary publications everywhere and regarding them as treasures.
    In order to "do a good job," please give us "sharp tools." 　　　Xue Ming

    Don't Keep Serving Up Leftovers
    Recently, many publications have carried interesting fables and anecdotes passed down through the ages. These short and concise stories, like dewdrops in the morning sun, shine with the light of intelligence and wisdom. Centuries have passed, yet they still feel fresh and interesting!
    However, we must not therefore indiscriminately stuff everything into publications. Take the fables "drawing a snake and adding feet," "self-contradiction," "carving a boat to find a sword," and "waiting for a rabbit by a tree" as examples. Many books and periodicals have repeated them countless times, and some have even been incorporated into elementary school textbooks long ago. What new and different perspectives have our introducers offered? People are easily reminded of the old-fashioned teachers who teach students "Confucius said this" this year and still teach students "Confucius said this" next year. Don't keep serving up leftovers!

    In Front of the Literary Theory Bookshelf
    In the bookstores of Xinhua Bookstore, there is generally a "Literary Theory" section. If this section is further divided into "Chinese Literary Theory," "Soviet Literary Theory," and "Foreign Literary Theory," the following phenomenon will occur:
    In the "Foreign Literary Theory" category, there is only one book, "The Origin and Development of Poetry." The "Chinese Literary Theory" category is more prosperous. But after books such as "Literary Essays" and "History of Chinese Literary Criticism" are bought, this area immediately appears desolate. The "Soviet Literary Theory" category is never neglected, it is truly crowded and dense.
    We should of course learn from and absorb the achievements of the Soviet Union in literary theory. But this does not mean indiscriminately translating and publishing, let alone ignoring or even excluding the achievements of other countries in literary and artistic theory.　                               Yu Chen

    读者中来
    多出版些工具书
    “工欲善其事，必先利其器。”这是句古话了。最近，大有感于此言。
    我自己是个学文学的，平时很想能做一些研究工作，然而却往往因为无“器”而中止。
    到现在，我们的一些工具书还是些“遗老”，唯一可用的最普通的工具书仍然是抗战前后编纂的“辞海”“辞源”。这些书有的内容有错误，像把李自成说成是“贼”的解释等；有的是文字游戏式的解释，例如甲者，乙也，乙者，甲也的互注。比较专门的工具书更是少得可怜，例如，没有一本比较完备正确的社会政治科学的辞典，也没有一本能使人看明白的文艺辞典，这就难怪有些青年文学爱好者只得随身带了个小本本，到处摘录文艺刊物上的名词解释而奉为至宝了。
    为了“善其事”，请给我们以“利器”吧。　　　学鸣
    不要老炒冷饭
    近来，许多刊物刊载了历代流传下来的一些饶有趣味的寓言掌故。这些短小精悍的故事，像朝阳下的颗颗露珠，闪着聪明睿智的光彩。千百年过去了，仍令人感到新鲜、兴味盎然！
    可是也决不能因此毫无选择地把一切东西都充塞到刊物上去。以“画蛇添足”、“自相矛盾”、“刻舟求剑”、“守株待兔”等寓言为例，已经有许多书刊重复过无数次了，甚至有些早就编入了小学课本里。我们的介绍者又作了一些什么与众不同的新说呢？人们很容易想起今年教学生“子曰诗云”、明年还是教学生“子曰诗云”的冬烘先生。不要老是炒冷饭吧！

    在文艺理论书架前
    在新华书店的门市部里，大都有“文艺理论”栏。如果把这一栏再分成“中国文艺理论”“苏联文艺理论”和“外国文艺理论”三类的话，就会发生这样的现象：
    在“外国文学理论”这一类，只有一本“诗歌的源流”。在“中国文艺理论”类，比较繁荣些。可是当“文学论稿”“中国文学批评史”等几本书被买走之后，这儿就立刻显得萧条了。永远不冷落的是“苏联文艺理论”那一类，这儿真是拥挤不堪，密密层层。
    苏联在文艺理论上的成果我们当然要学习、要吸收。但这绝不等于无选择地翻译和出版，更不等于忽视甚至排斥其他国家在文学艺术理论上的成果。　                               雨辰
