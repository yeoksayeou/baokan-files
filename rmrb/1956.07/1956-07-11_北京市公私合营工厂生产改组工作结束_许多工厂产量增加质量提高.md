Xinhua News Agency, 10th - The thirty-four sectors of joint state-private industry in Beijing have basically completed their production reorganization. After more than six months of production reorganization, the vast majority of factories in these sectors have shown a completely new look. According to data from the glass, rubber, and medical equipment industries, it is estimated that the output of general factories this year can increase by about 30% compared to last year (i.e., before joint ownership), and some sectors such as printing and hardware can increase by 50%. In these few months, the quality of products in many factories has improved, and costs have also been reduced; the factories have also trial-produced many new products.

During the reorganization process, except for the capitalist personnel of enterprises that cannot be merged temporarily, whose jobs have not been rearranged, all other capitalist personnel have been reasonably arranged. Among them, more than 1,000 people are responsible for work as managers, deputy managers, factory directors, deputy factory directors, section chiefs, division chiefs, and workshop directors in professional companies. More than 1,000 workers have also been promoted to leadership positions in production during the reorganization.

The production reorganization of joint state-private industry in Beijing was started after careful preparation. Before the reorganization, a thorough investigation was conducted to formulate a reorganization plan, which was fully discussed and revised by employees and capitalists. During the reorganization, attention was paid to the characteristics of Beijing's existing joint state-private industry and its original cooperative relationships. Attention was also paid to giving play to the positive role of large factories and advanced factories during the merger, and attention was also paid to ensuring that factories with special technical products did not lose their original characteristics.

    北京市公私合营工厂生产改组工作结束
    许多工厂产量增加质量提高
    新华社10日讯　北京市公私合营工业的三十四个行业，已经基本上结束了生产改组工作。这些行业经过六个多月的生产改组，绝大部分工厂都出现了从来没有的新气象。据玻璃、橡胶、医疗器械等行业的资料估计，今年一般工厂的产量可以比去年（即合营以前）提高30％左右，个别行业如印刷、五金等可以提高50％。在这几个月里，许多工厂的产品质量有了改进，成本也降低了；各厂还试制出了许多新产品。
    在改组的过程中，除了暂时不能并厂的企业的资方人员，工作没有重新安排以外，其他所有的资方人员都得到了合理的安排，其中担任专业公司经理、副经理、厂长、副厂长以及科长、股长、车间主任等负责工作的就有一千多人。还有一千多工人也在改组中被提拔到领导生产的岗位上来。
    北京市公私合营工业的生产改组工作，是在进行了周密的准备工作以后才开始的。在改组前经过充分调查制定了改组规划，这个规划并且经过职工、资本家充分讨论和修正。在改组时，注意了北京现有公私合营工业特点和原有协作关系，并厂时也注意发挥大厂和先进厂的积极作用，对于有特殊技术产品的工厂，也注意使它不丧失原有特点。
