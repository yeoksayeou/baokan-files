    The Welfare of Soviet Workers is Increasing Daily
    Seven-Hour and Six-Hour Workday System is Being Prepared for Implementation
    The State Allocates Huge Sums to Improve Employee Welfare and Cultural Standards
    (Dispatch from our correspondent in Moscow, July 21) Currently, there are over 42 million Soviet trade union members. This was announced by Solovyov, Vice Chairman of the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions, at the Press Club on the 20th. Solovyov told reporters: "Concern for improving the material welfare and cultural level of workers is the fundamental content of trade union work. The welfare of Soviet workers is growing. During this Five-Year Plan period, the real wages of Soviet workers will increase by an average of 30%, and the state expenditure on social and cultural measures will increase by 56 billion rubles, reaching 210 billion rubles in 1960." Since the 20th Congress of the CPSU, many measures to improve the lives of workers have been implemented in a short period: shortening work by two hours on the day before holidays, a six-hour workday for underage workers, extension of maternity leave for women, the passage of new pension laws, and the complete abolition of tuition fees for universities and colleges. Solovyov said: "Preparations are underway to gradually implement a seven-hour workday and a six-hour workday for underground work such as coal mining."
    Solovyov said: "In 1957 and 1958, Soviet workers will first implement this measure in the heavy industry sector, and then in all sectors. They enjoy the right to vacation and generally spend their holidays in sanatoriums and rest homes. This year, it is estimated that more than five million people will recuperate and receive treatment in 2,178 sanatoriums and 939 rest homes. The duration of stay in rest homes is twelve to twenty-four days, and the duration of stay in sanatoriums is twenty-four to sixty days. Some workers entering rest homes and sanatoriums are free of charge, while others only pay 30% of the cost. In addition, 585 industrial enterprises have night sanatoriums where workers go for recuperation after work. In the suburbs of many industrial cities, there are day rest homes where workers rest from Saturday evening to Monday morning."
    Approximately 1.5 million workers travel across the country during their vacations. Well-equipped houses and sports facilities are available to serve travelers. Many workers spend their holidays in their own or rented villas in the suburbs. Workers staying in the city also have many places to relax. The trade unions alone have 10,500 clubs and cultural palaces, 1,324 sports fields, 3,408 stadiums, 1,186 sports centers, 58 gymnasiums, 44 yacht clubs, 345 aquatic sports grounds, 264 rowing locations, as well as over 17,000 large libraries (containing a total of 120 million books), 112,000 reading rooms, and over 10,000 film screening venues. Workers widely participate in collective outings on Sundays.

    国家拨出巨款提高职工福利和文化水平
    本报莫斯科21日电　苏联工会会员现在达到四千二百多万。这是全苏工会中央理事会副主席索洛维耶夫二十日在记者俱乐部说的。索洛维耶夫向记者们说：关心提高劳动者物质福利和文化水平，是工会工作的基本内容。苏联劳动者的福利在增长着。在这个五年计划期间，苏联职工的实际工资平均将增加30％，国家用在社会文化措施上的经费将增加五百六十亿卢布，而使在1960年达到二千一百亿卢布。苏共第二十次代表大会以来，在不久时间内，已经实行了许多改善劳动者生活的措施：假日前一天的缩短两个小时工作，未成年工人的六小时工作日，妇女产假的延长，抚恤金新法案的通过，大中学校学费的完全免除。索洛维耶夫说：正在准备逐步实行七小时工作日和采煤采矿等地下工作的六小时工作日。
    索洛维耶夫说：苏联职工在1957、1958年先在重工业部门，然后在所有部门实现这个措施。享受休假权利并且普遍到疗养所、休养所度过假期。今年预计有五百万人以上在二千一百七十八个疗养所和939个休养所休养和治疗。休养所期限为十二天到二十四天，疗养所期限为二十四天到六十天。进休养所和疗养所的劳动者有的免费，有的只出30％费用。此外，五百八十五个工业企业有夜间疗养所，职工们下班后就到那里疗养。在许多工业城市的郊外有一天休养所，职工们从星期六晚上休息到星期一早上。
    约一百五十万职工在自己休假期间在全国各地旅行。有设备很好的房屋和运动场所为旅行者服务。许多职工在城郊自己的或租赁的别墅中度过假期。留在城市内的职工也有许多休息去处。仅仅工会就有一万零五百所俱乐部和文化宫、1，324个运动场、3408个体育场子、1186个体育所、五十八个体育馆、四十四个帆艇俱乐部、345个水上运动场、264个划船处、还有一万七千多大型图书馆（共藏书一亿二千万册），十一万二千红角和一万多电影放映场。职工们在星期天广泛地集体郊游。
