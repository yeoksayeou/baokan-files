    He Should Be Sanctioned by Law
    To the Editor:
    I am an active serviceman, and now I want to accuse Hu Jingzhou, a staff member of the Zhejiang Provincial Public Security Bureau, of illegal behavior in undermining the marriage of a revolutionary soldier.
    In October 1954, my wife, Duan Zheng, was transferred from the army to work at the Shenyang City Reception Office. At that time, Hu Jingzhou, a cadre working at the China International Travel Service in Beijing, was also assigned to work there. During their time working together, Hu, knowing full well that my wife was married, developed an improper "love" for her. Later, Hu was transferred to work at the Zhejiang Provincial Public Security Bureau, but he continued to write letters to my wife. In October 1955, he even shamelessly professed his love to my wife. In November, I graduated from a military academy and was assigned to work in Shenyang. I discovered their improper relationship and reported it to the organization. The organization then persuaded them both through education. Logically, Hu Jingzhou should have corrected his mistakes and broken off his relationship with my wife. Who knew that he would intensify his attacks on my wife, even forcing her to divorce me. What is even more intolerable is that during the 1956 Spring Festival, after I returned to the army from the Reception Office, Hu Jingzhou flew from Hangzhou to Shenyang and fooled around with my wife in a hotel for two days. On the third day, the organization discovered this, and Hu was forced to return to Zhejiang. Afterwards, the Party organization of the Reception Office educated and dealt with my wife (she is a Communist Party member). She also made a self-criticism at the branch general meeting and expressed her determination to improve her relationship with me. However, Hu Jingzhou still clung to her, secretly instigating her to divorce me.
    Hu Jingzhou, as a staff member of a state organ, knowingly violated the law and should be sanctioned by law.
                                                                                                        Xu Yuanyi

    他该受法律制裁编辑同志：
    我是一个现役军人，现在我要向你们控诉浙江省公安厅工作人员胡景洲破坏革命军人婚姻的违法行为。
    1954年10月，我妻子段征从部队转业到沈阳市交际处工作，当时在北京国际旅行社工作的干部胡景洲也同时被派到该处工作，他俩在一同工作期间，胡虽明知我妻子是有夫之妇，但却对她产生了不正确的“爱情”。后来胡被调至浙江省公安厅工作，仍不断写信给我妻子。1955年10月，更恬不知耻地向我妻子求爱。十一月我从某军校结业，被分配去沈阳工作，发觉他们之间不正确的关系，便向组织上作了汇报，并通过组织，分别给他们以说服教育。按理说，胡景洲应该痛改前非，断绝和我妻子的关系。谁知他反而加紧向我妻子进攻，甚至逼迫我妻子和我离婚。更加使人不能容忍的是：1956年春节，当我从交际处回部队后，胡景洲便乘飞机从杭州赶到了沈阳，和我妻子在一个旅馆里鬼混了两天，第三天组织上发觉，胡才被迫返回浙江。事后，交际处党组织对我妻子进行了教育与处理（她是共产党员），她也在支部大会上作了检讨，并表示要决心和我搞好关系。胡景洲却仍缠住她不放，暗中唆使她和我离婚。
    胡景洲身为国家机关干部，竟然知法犯法，应该受到法律的制裁。　许远宜
