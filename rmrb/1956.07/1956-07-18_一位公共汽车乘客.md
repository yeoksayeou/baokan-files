    A Bus Passenger

    On the bus.

    From the conversation of two passengers, I learned that one of them was a bureau-level cadre who had just been transferred to Beijing to work. It seemed that he was originally the head of a certain department in the locality. He wore his hat very low, as if afraid of being seen.
    
    "The buses in Beijing are really crowded."

    His companion's casual remark evoked his sentiments. He sighed and said, "Don't people say: after coming to Beijing, the cars you ride get bigger and bigger, the houses you live in get smaller and smaller, the work gets more and more, and the pay gets less and less?"

    This "disappointed" person's voice grew louder and more impassioned. It seemed he had a bellyful of complaints; but on this crowded bus, all he got were contemptuous glances from those sitting next to him.

    一位公共汽车乘客
    劳洪
    在公共汽车上。
    从两个乘客的对话中，我知道其中一个是刚从外地调到北京来工作的处长一级的干部，看来他原是地方某部门的首长。他的帽子戴得很低，似乎怕被人瞧见。
    “北京的公共汽车真挤。”
    他的同伴随口说的这句话，却引起他的感慨，他叹口气，说：“人家不是说：到北京以后，总是汽车越坐越大，房子越住越小，工作越来越多，待遇越来越少么？”
    这位“不得意”者的声音越来越高，慷慨激昂，看来，他似乎有满腹牢骚；但在这挤满乘客的公共汽车上，他所得到的却只是邻座的鄙夷的目光。
