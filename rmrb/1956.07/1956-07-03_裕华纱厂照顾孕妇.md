Yuhua Cotton Mill Cares for Pregnant Women

(Our dispatch) Wuhan—Female workers at the joint state-private Yuhua Cotton Mill in Wuhan are receiving special care during their pregnancies.

The Yuhua Cotton Mill makes it a rule to transfer female employees during their pregnancy to lighter work to prevent them from overexerting themselves. It also stipulates that female workers who sleep on the upper bunks in the dormitory must switch to the lower bunks after becoming pregnant. The factory has a rest room for pregnant women, allowing female workers who are more than six months pregnant to rest for one hour in the middle of each shift. There is also an observation room for threatened abortions, where female employees with signs of miscarriage receive treatment and care in advance. Recently, money was also drawn from the enterprise bonus to buy a transportation vehicle, specially for picking up and dropping off pregnant women and female workers with infants on rainy days.

    裕华纱厂照顾孕妇
    本报讯　武汉市公私合营裕华纱厂女工在怀孕期间受到特别照顾。
    裕华纱厂对怀孕期间的女职工，一律调换轻便的工作，防止她们过分劳累，还规定在宿舍中睡上铺的女工，在怀孕后一律改睡下铺。工厂设有孕妇休息室，让怀孕六月以上的女工在每班工作中间休息一小时。设有先兆流产观察室，对一些有流产现象的女职工事先进行治疗护理。最近，还从企业奖金中抽出钱来买了一辆交通车，专供雨天接送孕妇和带婴儿的女工用。
