Xinhua News Agency, Qiqihar, 15th. The advanced producer movement in Qiqihar city's factories and enterprises exhibits some formalistic tendencies.

In a report delivered by Yang Jun'tian, vice chairman of the city's Federation of Trade Unions, at a mass production work meeting held by the Federation on the 13th, it was stated that the formalism in Qiqihar's advanced producer movement is mainly manifested in the following ways: the movement seems to be vigorous and lively, and many advanced producers have emerged, but the majority of units are not performing well in completing the state production plan. In the second quarter, only three of the nine state-owned factories completed the gross output value plan, and two factories completed the gross commodity value plan; among the twenty-six local state-owned factories, only ten factories completed the gross output value plan, and only eight factories completed the gross commodity value plan.

Another manifestation of formalism is that the work of summarizing and promoting advanced experiences is somewhat blind. According to a survey of thirty-three state-owned and local state-owned factories, only thirteen factories have formulated plans to promote advanced experiences. Many units have neglected to promote advanced experiences in weak production links. Many of the rationalization proposals put forward by the broad masses of workers during the movement are still being held up.

In addition, after the movement was launched, some units only organized the isolated evaluation, naming, and rewarding of advanced producers, abandoning the effective experiences of past competitions—formulating competition guarantee conditions, organizing production meetings, and other normal organizational work.

In order to overcome formalism in the movement, the city's Federation of Trade Unions has organized eighteen grassroots trade unions to exchange experiences in effectively organizing the advanced producer movement, and has requested the leading personnel of each grassroots trade union to vigorously change their leadership style and delve into the workers and the movement.

### 齐齐哈尔工厂企业  先进生产者运动有形式主义偏向

    齐齐哈尔工厂企业
    先进生产者运动有形式主义偏向
    据新华社齐齐哈尔15日电　齐齐哈尔市工厂企业的先进生产者运动，存在着一些形式主义的偏向。
    在十三日市工会联合会召开的群众生产工作会议上，市工会副主席杨俊田所做的报告中讲到，齐齐哈尔市先进生产者运动中的形式主义，主要表现在：运动开展得似乎轰轰烈烈，先进生产者也出现了不少，但是多数单位完成国家生产计划的情况并不好。第二季度，九个国营工厂只有三个厂完成了生产总值计划，两个厂完成了商品总值计划；二十六个地方国营工厂，仅有十个厂完成了生产总值计划，完成商品总值计划的只有八个厂。
    形式主义的另一个表现，是总结、推广先进经验的工作带有一些盲目性。据三十三个国营、地方国营工厂的调查，仅有十三个工厂制定了推广先进经验的计划。许多单位忽视了在生产薄弱环节中推广先进经验。广大职工在运动中提出的合理化建议，有许多还被积压着。
    此外，有些单位在运动开展以后，只是孤立地去组织评比先进生产者，命名，奖励，把过去组织竞赛的有效经验——制定竞赛保证条件、组织生产会议等正常的组织工作丢掉了。
    为了克服运动中的形式主义，市工会联合会组织了十八个基层工会，交流了切实地组织先进生产者运动的经验，并且要求各基层工会的领导人员，大力改变领导作风，深入到工人群众和运动当中去。
