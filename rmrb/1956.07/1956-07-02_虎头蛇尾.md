    Grand Beginning, Poor Finish
    Wu Lü

    The National Conference of Advanced Producers Representatives has concluded, and advanced producer representative conferences in various industrial systems have also mostly concluded. The representatives exchanged experiences and observed demonstrations at the meetings, creating quite a lively atmosphere. Every industry and profession produced champions, and there were sets of advanced experiences. People hoped that the leaders of various enterprises, after the advanced producers returned to their posts, would be able to rely on them to promote advanced experiences and better develop the advanced producer movement.

    Many enterprises have lived up to everyone's expectations: advanced experiences have been promoted well, and the advanced producer movement has also been developed well. After listening to the reports from the representatives who attended the National Conference of Advanced Producers Representatives, the leaders of the Dalian Mining Vehicle Factory formulated a plan to promote 46 kinds of advanced experiences by the end of September. By June 9th, they had already promoted 11 kinds, greatly improving production efficiency. The first Advanced Producer Representatives Conference of the Tianjin Grain Industry focused on the key problems of low quality and large waste in current production, exchanging and summarizing 77 kinds of advanced experiences brought back by advanced producers from Beijing and locally, ensuring that in the second half of this year, without increasing raw materials, the state would receive an extra 1.7 million jin of rice and white flour. These can be regarded as the advanced experiences brought back by advanced producers blossoming and bearing fruit, or at least having a definite outcome.

    However, there are also unbelievably regrettable things: some units sent advanced producers to Beijing with gongs and drums and red silk, but after they returned, they silently relegated them to the "cold palace."

    Li Hongzhen, an advanced producer in the roving frame workshop of the Dasheng Yarn Factory in Nantong City, Jiangsu Province, immediately introduced the lap splicing method she learned at the meeting in Beijing to the workshop director, requesting the promotion of this advanced experience. However, no matter how many times she raised the suggestion, the workshop director always nodded with an "Uh-huh! Uh-huh!" and sent her away.

    Jie Jiaxing, an advanced producer at the Tianjin Third Machine Factory, sent all the materials on advanced experiences he brought back from Beijing to the factory director, and also called repeatedly to ask, "How are we going to promote them?" The factory director's secretary invariably replied, "We have studied it and are preparing to find someone to be responsible for this matter."

    This attitude towards the advanced producer movement naturally arouses people's dissatisfaction. Jie Jiaxing had to loudly appeal at the Tianjin Municipal Bureau of Mechanical and Electrical Industry's advanced producer symposium, demanding that the leadership promote advanced experiences. Nantong City apparently has not prepared a venue for advanced producers to loudly appeal, and Li Hongzhen had to grumble in the factory: "I have never seen a leader who doesn't support the promotion of advanced experiences like this. Did they call us to Beijing for a sightseeing trip?"

    As the saying goes, "Grand beginning, poor finish," refers to those people and things that start well but don't follow through to the end. It is unthinkable that when dealing with the promotion of advanced experiences and the development of the advanced producer movement—such serious political and economic tasks—there are actually people who "start well but don't finish," or even "have a beginning but no end."

    To make the promotion of advanced experiences and the development of the advanced producer movement "have a beginning and an end," advanced producers and the broad masses of workers must come out and loudly appeal, like Jie Jiaxing, so that those who are accustomed to "grand beginning, poor finish" and "having a beginning but no end" can no longer sit quietly in their offices.

    虎头蛇尾
    吴滤
    全国先进生产者代表会议开过了，各个产业系统的先进生产者代表会议也大都开过了。代表们在会上交流经验、观摩表演，很是热闹了一阵。各行各业都出了状元，先进经验都是一套一套的。人们希望各个企业的领导同志在先进生产者回到自己的岗位之后，能够依靠他们把先进经验推广开来，把先进生产者运动更好地开展起来。
    有很多企业没有辜负大家的期望：先进经验推广得很好，先进生产者运动也开展得很好。大连工矿车辆厂的领导同志在听取了出席全国先进生产者代表会议的代表们的会报之后，订出了到九月底推广四十六种先进经验的规划，到六月九日已经推广了十一种，大大提高了生产效率。天津市粮谷工业第一次先进生产者代表会议针对当前生产中质量低、浪费大的关键问题，交流和总结了先进生产者从北京带回来的和当地的七十七种先进经验，保证今年下半年在不增加原料的基础上，给国家多出大米、白面一百七十万斤。这些，都算得是先进生产者带回去的先进经验开了花、结了果，至少也有了个下落。
    然而，竟也有如此令人难以置信的事情：有的单位敲锣打鼓、披红挂彩地把先进生产者送到北京；待他们回来后，却不声不响地把他们打入了“冷宫”。
    江苏省南通市大生纱厂副厂的粗纱车间先进生产者李红珍一回到车间，就向车间主任介绍在北京开会时学到的包卷接头法，要求推广这个先进经验。可是意见再三提，车间主任总是“嗯！嗯！”地点点头，把她打发走了。
    天津第三机器厂的先进生产者解家兴，把从北京带回来的许多先进经验的材料都送到厂长那儿去，也是三番五次地打电话问：“怎么推广？”厂长秘书的回答照例是：“研究了，准备找专人负责这件事”。
    这种对待先进生产者运动的态度，自然地会引起人们的不满。解家兴不得不在天津市机电工业局先进生产者座谈会上大声疾呼，要求领导上推广先进经验。南通市看来还没有为先进生产者准备大声疾呼的场合，李红珍只得在厂里发牢骚：“从来没有见过这样不支持推广先进经验的领导，难道是叫我们到北京去游览一趟的吗？”
    俗语说：“虎头蛇尾”，指的是那些有始无终的人和事，不想对待推广先进经验，对待开展先进生产者运动这样严肃的政治和经济任务，竟然也有“虎头蛇尾”甚至是“有头无尾”的人。
    要使先进经验的推广和先进生产者运动的开展“有头有尾”，还需要先进生产者们和广大的职工们，像解家兴一样出来大声疾呼，让那些惯于“虎头蛇尾”、“有头无尾”的人不能再安安静静地在办公室里坐下去。
