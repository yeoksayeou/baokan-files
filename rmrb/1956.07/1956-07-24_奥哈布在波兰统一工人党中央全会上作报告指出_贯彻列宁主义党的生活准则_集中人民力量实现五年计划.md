Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, July 22nd: Warsaw newspapers on July 20th published the report by Ochab, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party, at the Seventh Plennary Session of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party, regarding the political and economic situation and the party's main tasks.

Ochab pointed out that this plenary session will adopt resolutions on the guiding principles of the Five-Year Economic Plan, and will make important decisions on the future work of the Party, strengthening the democratization of social life, further strengthening the ties between the Party and the masses, giving play to the creative initiative of the masses, and eliminating errors and deviations in the Party's work.

Ochab said that the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union was a new and important driving force, impelling us to critically analyze the work we have done in all aspects of socialist construction.

Ochab then analyzed the background and environment of the Poznan incident. He said that in estimating the causes of this incident, it is first necessary to find out its social basis. He called on the Polish working class and all working people to be highly vigilant against the conspiracies of hidden counter-revolutionaries and instigators.

After describing Poland's achievements, Ochab pointed out that opposing waste, eliminating imbalances in industry, and ensuring full utilization of all production potential are necessary conditions for ensuring a 53% to 57% increase in industrial production in the new Five-Year Plan, and that the increase in industrial production will lead to an increase in the living standards of the working people.

When implementing the plan to increase agricultural production, the main task that must never be forgotten is that rural socialist transformation must continue on the basis of agricultural production cooperatives.

Ochab spoke in detail about the tasks of further strengthening the Party's work, universally implementing Lenin's Party life principles, and resolutely overcoming the personality cult and its consequences.

Ochab concluded by saying that now, we should concentrate the strength of the Party, the working class, and all the people to realize our plans, first of all the economic plan, to complete the Five-Year Plan and the task of raising the living standards of the working class. We must present this plan to the masses and arm them with the belief in its realism and correctness. This requires the entire Party to strengthen its unity.
