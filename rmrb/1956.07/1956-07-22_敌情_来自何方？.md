Where Does the "Enemy Situation" Come From?
Ma Rong

Recently, in Suiqi, Lufeng, Huiyang and other counties in Guangdong Province, some phenomena of agricultural producers' cooperatives members withdrawing from the cooperatives and cooperatives breaking up have occurred successively. The reason is that the production of these cooperatives is not doing well, and the situation of wasteland is relatively serious. When distributing the spring harvest crops, some cooperatives did not take into account that many crops were planted by the members individually last winter, and excessively emphasized the unified distribution to the cooperative; the cost of the crops was also set unreasonably. Therefore, it affected the lives of some members and aroused dissatisfaction among some members.

The Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China has instructed the Party committees in these areas to take measures quickly to effectively solve the current production and livelihood difficulties of the members, and to solve the issue of withdrawal and dissolution as a prominent problem in the rectification of the cooperatives.

Most cadres can follow the instructions of the Provincial Party Committee, fully organize production in the rectification of the cooperatives, develop diversified operations, do a good job in the summer harvest pre-distribution, ensure that 90% of the members increase their income, and solve the remaining mutual benefit problems within the cooperatives.

However, the secretary of the Twelfth District Committee of Suiqi County adopted an extremely wrong approach: he went to the Anji First Cooperative, which had a more serious problem, to carry out the work of rectifying the cooperative, and at the beginning, he arranged for a member of the Communist Youth League to pretend to request withdrawal from the cooperative, to go to the masses to "discover the enemy situation"; then he convened a meeting of the cooperative members and declared aggressively: "Whoever wants to withdraw from the cooperative, come to the stage to register!" and said: "Whoever does not agree with socialism is a counter-revolutionary!" to threaten those who wanted to withdraw from the cooperative. However, it was ineffective. After the meeting, those who had withdrawn did not return, but those who had not withdrawn were determined to withdraw. At that time, 31 households registered to withdraw from the cooperative.

Since the phenomenon of withdrawal and dissolution has occurred, it is considered by this district committee secretary as a serious "enemy situation," then he should be vigilant and realistically study where the "enemy situation" comes from and how to eliminate it. However, he did not do so. He just made a rude and intimidating show.

In fact, the real enemies are arrogance, complacency, and bureaucracy that do not care about the vital interests of the masses. The reason why the phenomenon of withdrawal and dissolution occurred in Anji First Cooperative is because the cadres there developed a sense of arrogance and complacency after the agricultural cooperation. They thought that with the cooperative, "everything is easy to handle, and there is no need to worry about anything"; therefore, in leading production, they replaced the conscientious attitude they had towards individual farmers in the past with a bureaucratic attitude. As a result, many problems in the cooperative could not be solved, production was not doing well, some rice seedlings had not been cultivated for more than 50 days after planting, and sideline production was not organized. In this way, how could the farmers not doubt the superiority of the cooperative? How could they not worry about going hungry with the cooperative? Under these circumstances, what is so strange about them asking to withdraw from the cooperative?

People who are arrogant tend to have a one-sided analysis of the objective situation, and they are also prone to being indifferent to the emotions and demands of the masses, falling into a state of ideological paralysis. When individual farmers initially withdrew from the Anji First Cooperative, the cadres of the Twelfth District saw only the phenomenon of individual members withdrawing from the cooperative, but did not see the real reason for the withdrawal. They said: This belongs to non-essential, non-mainstream problems. Therefore, instead of solving the problem as soon as it was discovered, they were at ease, thinking that "it is unavoidable." As a result, "non-essential, non-mainstream" problems developed into serious problems. At first, individual members doubted the superiority of the cooperative because the production of the cooperative was not doing well, and then some upper-middle peasants who were not firm enough in the cooperative cause also wavered; some members who lacked the ability to distinguish right from wrong blindly followed the withdrawal as more and more people withdrew. As a result, a trend of withdrawal was formed in the cooperative for a time. After being reminded by the leadership, the secretary of the Twelfth District Committee of Suiqi County paid attention to this issue. However, he panicked and took intimidating measures, trying to solve the problem in this way. As a result, things got worse and worse.

Obviously, to prevent members from withdrawing from the cooperative, to prevent the cooperative from breaking up, we must first improve the work style of the cadres, and overcome arrogance, complacency, and bureaucracy that do not care about the vital interests of the masses. Apart from this, there is no magic formula.

    “敌情”来自何方？
    马戎
    广东省遂溪、陆丰、惠阳等县，最近陆续发生了一些农业生产合作社社员退社和合作社散伙的现象。原因是这些社的生产搞得不好，荒情比较严重。在分配春收作物的时候，有些合作社没有照顾到许多作物都是社员个人在去冬种植的，过分强调了归社统一分配；对作物的工本又定的不合理。因此影响了一部分社员的生活，引起一些社员不满。
    中共广东省委已指示这些地区的党委迅速采取措施，切实解决社员当前生产和生活上的困难，把退社和散伙的事作为整社中的一个突出问题加以解决。
    多数干部都能按照省委的指示，在整社中全力组织生产，开展多种经营，做好夏收预分，保证90％的社员增加收入，并解决社内遗留的互利问题。
    遂溪县第十二区区委书记却采取了一种极端错误的作法：他到问题较严重的岸基第一社去作整社工作，一开始就布置了一个青年团员，伪装要求退社，到群众中去“发现敌情”；然后召开社员大会，气势汹汹地宣布：“谁要退社就上台报名！”并且说：“谁不赞成社会主义就是反革命！”借以威胁退社的人。可是，无效。会后，已退社的人既不回来，未退社的人却决心退社了。当时报名退社的就有三十一户。
    既然发生退社和散伙的现象，在这位区委书记的心目中被当成“发生敌情”那末严重，他就应该提高警惕，实事求是地研究“敌情”来自何方，如何消灭。但是，他却没有这样做。他只是粗暴地虚咋唬了一场。
    其实，真正的敌人就是骄傲自满和不关心群众切身利益的官僚主义。岸基第一社所以会发生退社和散伙的现象，就因为那里的干部在农业合作化以后，滋长着一种骄傲自满的情绪。他们认为有了合作社“什么都好办了，一切不用操心了”；于是，在领导生产上以官僚主义的态度代替了过去对待个体农民的那种兢兢业业的态度。结果，使社里的许多问题不能解决，生产搞得不好，有些水稻插下五十多天还没有中耕，副业生产也没有组织起来。这样，农民对合作社的优越性怎么能不发生怀疑？怎么能不担心随着合作社就会饿肚子？在这情况下，他们提出退社要求又有什么值得奇怪？
    有了骄气的人，对于客观情况的分析往往是片面的，对群众的情绪和要求也容易漠不关心，陷入一种思想麻痹的状态。岸基第一社起初发生个别农民退社时候，第十二区的干部所看到的仅仅是个别社员退社的现象，而看不到退社的真正原因。他们说：这是属于非本质、非主流的问题。因此，不是一发现问题就去解决，而是泰然自若，认为“在所难免”。结果呢，“非本质、非主流”的问题发展成为严重的问题。起初是个别社员由于社的生产搞得不好而对于社的优越性发生怀疑，继而有些原来对合作化事业就不够坚定的上中农也跟着动摇；部分缺乏明辨是非能力的社员眼看退社的人越来越多，也就盲目跟着退社。于是，在这个社一时形成了退社的风气。经领导上提醒以后，遂溪县第十二区区委书记是注意了这个问题。可是他却惊慌失措地采取了咋唬的办法，企图这样解决问题。这样，就把事情越弄越糟了。
    很明显，要让社员不退社，要让合作社不散伙，首先要改进干部的工作作风，克服骄傲自满和不关心群众切身利益的官僚主义。除此以外，别无妙法。
