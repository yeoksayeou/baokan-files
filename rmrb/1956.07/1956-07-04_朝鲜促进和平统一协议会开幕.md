Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, July 2nd -- The inaugural meeting of the Council for the Promotion of Peaceful Unification convened today in Pyongyang.

Former South Korean prominent figure, Zhao Suang, delivered a report at the meeting. He called on all patriotic individuals in both North and South Korea to unite and strive to achieve the peaceful reunification of the fatherland. In his report, Zhao Suang emphatically pointed out that for the sake of the nation's freedom, independence, and prosperity, and for the realization of the peaceful reunification of the fatherland, we oppose fratricidal war. We advocate that the two regimes, all political parties, social organizations, and individual figures in the North and South should consult with each other on the issue of the reunification of the fatherland. We believe that, for the sake of peaceful reunification, the unified government to be established must be a democratic and autonomous joint government, and it must be a government produced on the basis of free and democratic elections. This council will work to establish such a government and strive to promote the convening of a conference of relevant countries.

Zhao Suang also said that today, one side's system cannot be imposed on the other, and unification cannot be achieved by one side merging with the other. We oppose one-sided annexation-style unification, because this is a disguised means of unification by force, which can only lead to the recurrence of war and continued separation.

A total of more than 800 people attended and were present at today's meeting. Among those attending the conference were 48 people, including initiators from various political parties and social organizations in former South Korea, as well as former South Korean National Assembly members.

Kim Tu-bong, Hong Myung-hee, Kim Dal-hyun, Hong Ki-hwang and others, representatives of the Korean Fatherland Front, attended the meeting as observers.

    朝鲜促进和平统一协议会开幕
    新华社平壤2日电　促进和平统一协议会成立大会今天在平壤开幕。
    前南朝鲜著名人士赵素昂在会上作了报告。他号召南北朝鲜全体爱国人士团结一致，争取实现祖国的和平统一。赵素昂在报告中着重指出，为了民族的自由、独立和繁荣，为了实现祖国的和平统一，我们反对同族相残的战争。我们主张南北的两个政权、各政党、社会团体以及个别人士互相协商祖国的统一问题。我们认为，为了和平统一，将成立的统一政府必须是民主、自主的联合政府，并且必须是根据自由的民主选举产生的政府。这个协议会将为建立这样的政府而努力，为促进召开有关国家会议而努力。
    赵素昂还说，今天，不能把一方的制度强加于他方，不能用任何一方合并另一方的方法来实现统一。我们反对片面的兼并式的统一，因为这是一种变相的武力统一的手段，这只能使战争再起和继续分离。
    出席和列席今天会议的共有八百多人。在出席大会的人里面有发起组织这个协议会的前南朝鲜各政党、社会团体和前南朝鲜国会议员等人士四十八人。
    朝鲜祖国战线代表金枓奉、洪命熹、金达铉、洪基璜等列席了会议。
