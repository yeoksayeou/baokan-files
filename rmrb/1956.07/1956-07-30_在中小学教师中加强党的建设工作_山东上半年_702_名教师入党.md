Strengthening Party Building Among Primary and Secondary School Teachers
　　Shandong: 702 Teachers Join the Party in the First Half of the Year

　　(Our newspaper's Jinan correspondent) This first half of the year, 702 primary and secondary school teachers in Shandong Province joined the Chinese Communist Party. These newly admitted Party members are all outstanding teachers who are active in their work, maintain close ties with the masses, and are willing to dedicate themselves to the cause of communist education.

　　In recent years, primary and secondary education in Shandong Province has developed greatly, but the Party organization is very weak. Before the end of 1955, there were only over 9,000 Party members among the more than 140,000 primary and secondary school teachers and staff in the province. The leading role of the Party falls far short of meeting the current needs in primary and secondary education. Therefore, the Provincial Party Committee has requested that 10,833 Party members be developed among secondary school teachers and staff and primary school teachers within the next two years. After this work is completed, on average, one out of every seven primary and secondary school teachers in the province will be a Communist Party member.

　　Currently, the Organization Department of the Provincial Party Committee has dispatched two organization inspectors to various special districts to inspect and supervise the progress of this work, and is preparing to issue circulars and criticisms to departments that do not pay attention to Party building in schools.

    在中小学教师中加强党的建设工作
    山东上半年702名教师入党
    本报讯　今年上半年，山东省有702名中、小学教师参加了中国共产党。这些新被接收的党员，都是工作积极、和群众有密切联系、并愿为共产主义教育事业奋斗到底的优秀教师。
    几年来，山东省中、小学教育有很大的发展，但党的组织非常薄弱，在1955年底以前，全省在十四万多名中、小学教职员中，只有九千多名党员。党的领导作用远不能满足当前在中、小学教育工作中的需要，因此，省委要求今明两年内，在中学教员、职员和小学教师中发展党员10，833人，这项工作完成后，全省中、小学教师平均每七人中，就有一名共产党员。
    目前，省委组织部已派出两名组织巡视员到各专区检查、督促这项工作的进行，并准备对不重视学校建党工作的部门进行通报和批评。　　　（本报驻济南记者）
