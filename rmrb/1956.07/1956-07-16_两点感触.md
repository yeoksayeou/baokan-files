　　Today, when the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao have further clarified the literary policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom," the opening of the Second National Exhibition of Traditional Chinese Painting is particularly exciting. I don't want to make specific comments on the exhibits of this exhibition, but I just want to talk about two points of impression.

　　First, looking at our traditional Chinese painting team from this exhibition

　　Our traditional Chinese painting team has always been very large. But although the team is large, its strength is weak. Painters are often confused about what kind of themes can and cannot be painted, and what traditional techniques can and cannot be used. This prevents many good flowers from blooming or blooming fully. This situation only changed after the first National Exhibition of Traditional Chinese Painting was held three years ago. That exhibition played a huge role in encouraging and mobilizing traditional Chinese painters, liberating much suppressed creativity, and since then the development of traditional Chinese painting has progressed rapidly. The fact that more than 900 works were selected for this exhibition, three times more than the first exhibition, is enough to illustrate this fact.

　　Looking at our traditional Chinese painting team from this exhibition, there are at least two points that are worth rejoicing. The first is that many well-cultivated veteran painters have met us again with their carefully crafted works. When I saw the works of Mr. Wu Hufan, Pan Tianshou, Liu Haisu, Xie Zhiliu... I really had a feeling of reunion after a long separation.

　　In the past, some veteran painters, with full political enthusiasm, wanted to serve the people with traditional Chinese painting. But they didn't know how to do it, and few people cared about and helped them. So they either sighed and put down their brushes, or abandoned their expertise and stubbornly painted workers, peasants, and soldiers, or pasted political labels on landscape and flower-and-bird paintings. When I saw Mr. Zhu Qizhan's "Chrysanthemum" in this exhibition, I felt relieved; when I saw Mr. Yu Fei'an's "Magnolia Oriole," with the elegant and appropriate inscription "The oriole shows its feathers, the magnolia faces the wind," I also felt gratified. There are many similar situations. This is not a trivial matter. This is the improvement of the understanding of traditional Chinese painters, and the correct embodiment of the literary policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom."

　　The second is that more Western-style painters have joined the traditional Chinese painting team. The vast majority of them are not just doing it for fun or just for once in a while. They really have a deep affection for traditional Chinese painting, and have some understanding and research on the traditional brush and ink of traditional Chinese painting. They have injected new blood into traditional Chinese painting, and have also learned new techniques from traditional Chinese painting. Although there are still many problems, it must be affirmed that this phenomenon is very good! It can be seen that it is unfounded to imagine that it will bring any destructive effect to traditional Chinese painting. It will only make traditional Chinese painting more fleshy, richer, and more colorful. Such works include Mr. Wu Zuoren's "Camel Herding" and Mr. Li Hu's "Portrait," etc. Their use of ink is indeed unique.

　　As for those young authors who have certain sketching skills and have joined the traditional Chinese painting team, we are even more happy. They are full of vitality and talent, and have produced many good works. Here, I just want to mention Fang Zengxian's "Every Grain is Hard-Earned."

　　Judging from the exhibits of this exhibition, our traditional Chinese painting team is growing stronger. This gives us greater confidence in the development prospects of traditional Chinese painting, and also makes us deeply feel that the mobilizing and organizing role of the exhibition cannot be ignored. We hope that more and more traditional Chinese painting exhibitions will be held, and more frequently.

　　Second, the weakest link is still figure painting

　　The breadth of themes and diversity of styles in this exhibition have exceeded the traditional Chinese painting parts of the first National Exhibition of Traditional Chinese Painting and the second National Art Exhibition. But it must be admitted that figure painting is still the weakest link, far from being comparable to the prosperity of landscape and flower-and-bird painting. This is worth our attention.

　　Art mainly expresses "people," and this is no exception for traditional Chinese painting. Especially today, the people create miracles and emerge heroes. How many epic themes are waiting for traditional Chinese painters to depict and praise with their wonderful brushwork! In this exhibition, although there are also some excellent works such as "The River is Clear and the Sun is Shining" (by Liu Danzhai), "No Matter What, I Want to Join the Cooperative" (by Tang Wenxuan), "Portrait of Old Man Qi Baishi" (by Xie Zhiguang), and "The Army Cart" (by Xu Yansun), the overall impression is that there are not enough figure paintings, the scope of reflecting life is not wide enough, and the handling of character images is also too simple. How fascinating are the works like the classical paintings "Night Banquet" and "Along the River During the Qingming Festival," which are full of charm and unforgettable at first sight!

　　Of course, the backwardness of figure painting has a long historical origin. In recent years, traditional Chinese painters have made great efforts to change this backward state and have achieved considerable results. The current problem is how to speed up the pace and quickly catch up with or surpass landscape and flower-and-bird painting. I think this is the solemn requirement of the times and the people for traditional Chinese painting.

　　For this reason, I hope that figure painters will not avoid difficulties and easily draw flowers, birds, and landscapes (this phenomenon is not an isolated case in this exhibition), but should draw more figures! If there are difficulties in creation, the leaders of the art world should try to help solve them. In addition, more people should be encouraged to paint figures; especially landscape painters, it is very beneficial to put some effort into figures. In this exhibition, there is a painting "Soviet Experts Visiting the Cooperative," in which the landscape is very good, but the figures are poor; there are quite a few similar situations. For young figure painters who already have a certain sketching foundation, they should learn more from tradition. In the exhibition, there are two paintings of sparrows, in which the faces of the children are painted very well, but when it comes to the clothes, it feels difficult. Even in the works of our beloved old painter Jiang Zhaohe, this problem has not been well resolved.

　　I hope that in the next National Exhibition of Traditional Chinese Painting, figure paintings will be more prosperous.

### 两点感触

    两点感触
    潘絜兹
    在党中央和毛主席进一步明确提出“百花齐放”的文艺方针的今天，第二届全国国画展览会的开幕是特别令人兴奋的。我不想对这次画展出品作具体的评介，只想谈两点感触。
    一、从这次画展看我们的国画队伍
    我们的国画队伍从来是很壮大的。但队伍壮大，力量却薄弱。画家常常困惑于何种题材可画不可画、传统技法可用不可用等等问题。使许多好花开不出来或开得不盛。这个情况，在三年前第一届全国国画展览会举行后才有了转变。那次展览，对国画家起了极大的鼓舞动员作用，使许多受到压抑的创造力得到解放，自此国画的发展一日千里。这次入选的作品达九百多件，较第一届画展增多了三倍，就很可说明这个事实。
    从这次画展看我们的国画队伍，至少有两点值得我们高兴。第一是不少修养有素的老画家又以他们的精心之作和我们见面了。当我看到吴湖帆、潘天寿、刘海粟、谢稚柳……诸先生的作品时，真有一种久别重逢的亲切之感。
    过去曾有一些老画家，怀着满腔的政治热情，要以国画为人民服务。但他们不知道怎样做，也少有人关心和帮助他们。于是他们不是长叹一声搁了笔，就是放弃了自己的专长硬画工农兵，或是在山水花鸟画上贴上政治标签。当我在这次画展中看到朱屺瞻先生的“菊花”时，心情如释重负；看到于非暗先生的“玉兰黄鹂”，题上“仓庚耀羽、玉树临风”这典雅妥贴的题词时，我也感到快慰。类此的情形很多，这不是一件小事，这是国画家认识的提高，是“百花齐放”文艺方针的正确体现。
    第二是更多的西画家参加了国画队伍。他们绝大多数不是逢场作戏、偶一为之，确是对国画发生了深厚感情，并对国画传统笔墨有一些体会和研究的。他们给国画注入了新血液，也从国画学得了对他们说来是新的技巧。虽然其中问题尚多，但必须肯定这现象好得很！可见设想它会给国画带来什么破坏作用是毫无根据的，它只会使国画更有血肉、更丰富多采。这类作品，我们可以举出吴作人先生的“牧驼”、李斛先生的“人像”等，他们对水墨的运用确有独到之处。
    至于那些具有一定素描技巧、加进国画队伍来的青年作者，更是使我们高兴。他们生气勃勃、才华毕露，已产生了不少好作品，这里我想只消举出方增先的“粒粒皆辛苦”就够了。
    从这次画展出品情况看来，我们的国画队伍是日益壮大了。这使我们对国画发展前途有了更大的信心，也深感展览会的动员组织作用的不可忽视。我们希望今后国画展览开得更多一些，更勤一些。
      二、最弱的一环仍是人物画
    这次展品题材的广泛和风格的多样，都超过了第一届国画展和第二届全国美展的国画部分。但是不必讳言，人物画仍是最弱的一环，远不能和山水花鸟的兴旺气象相比，这是值得我们注意的。
    艺术主要是表现“人”，这对国画也不例外。尤其今天，人民创造奇迹，涌现英雄，有多少史诗式的题材，等待国画家的生花妙笔去描绘赞颂！这次画展中，虽然也有“河清有日”（刘旦宅作）、“说什么我也要入社”（汤文选作）、“齐白石老人像”（谢之光作）、“兵车行”（徐燕荪作）等一些优秀的作品，但总的印象是人物画不够多，反映生活的面不够广，对于人物形象的处理也嫌失之简单。像古典绘画“夜宴图”、“清明上河图”那种神采照人、一见难忘的作品是多么令人神往呵！
    自然，人物画的落后有它长远的历史渊源，近几年来国画家为了改变这种落后状态，曾作了很大努力，也取得了不小的成绩。当前的问题是，如何使得步伐加快一些，迅速赶上或超过山水花鸟画。我觉得这是时代和人民对国画的庄严要求。
    为此，我希望人物画家不要避难就易地去画花鸟山水（这个现象在这次画展中不是个别的），还是多画些人物吧！如果创作上有困难，美术界领导应设法帮助解决。此外还应该鼓励更多的人来画人物；特别是山水画家，在人物上用些功夫是十分有益的。这次画展中有一幅“苏联专家参观合作社”，山水很好，人物就差；类此的情形颇不少。对于已经具备了一定素描基础的青年人物画家，则应该更多地向传统学习。画展中有两幅打麻雀的画，小孩面部画得极好，但一画到衣服，就感到棘手了。甚至在我们敬爱的老画家蒋兆和先生的作品中，这个问题也还不曾很好解决。
    希望下届国画展览中，人物画能再旺盛些。
