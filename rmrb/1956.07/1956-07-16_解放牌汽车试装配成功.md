    Liberation Brand Automobile Trial Assembly Successful
    Wang Pu

    Our country has long had highways and automobiles, but these automobiles were not manufactured by our own country. For many years, some of our engineering and technical personnel have wanted to use our own hands to manufacture automobiles, so that automobiles made by ourselves can run on the roads of our motherland. But in the old society, this was just a beautiful ideal. Only now has this ideal become a reality: the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant of China has assembled the first batch of Liberation brand automobiles in the process of trial production, and can be mass-produced soon. This is another glorious achievement of China's industrial construction, and a great good news for the Chinese people!

    If we trace the history of automobiles, not to mention the distant past, just starting from the automobile race held in Paris in July 1894, it has been more than sixty years. In such a long period of time, our country has experienced the Qing Dynasty, the Northern Warlords, and the Kuomintang reactionaries, but none of them changed the backward state of our industry, and we were always unable to manufacture automobiles ourselves. However, after the founding of the People's Republic of China, construction of the First Automobile Plant began on July 15, 1953. It has only taken three years to build the first automobile factory and assemble the first batch of Liberation brand automobiles in trial production. This means that in just three years, we have filled the gap of sixty years. How can this good news not excite our people and our friends!

    The automobile industry is a symbol of a country's industrial and technological level. Take the Liberation brand trucks to be produced by the First Automobile Plant as an example. It is composed of more than 3,000 parts and components, and requires more than 950 specifications of steel. More than 40 enterprises across the country are manufacturing more than 400 kinds of collaborative products for it. It can be said with certainty that if we only rely on our country's original weak industrial base, it would be absolutely impossible to meet the needs of automobile production. The reason why we can now trial-produce automobiles is precisely because our country's industry has developed considerably and our technical level has improved significantly in the past few years. These are the results of the tremendous efforts and creative labor made by the Chinese people under the leadership of the Party and with the assistance of the Soviet Union and other brotherly countries.

    Trial assembly is also a serious test for the construction and trial production of the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant. The results of the test show that the construction and installation engineering quality of the First Automobile Plant is good, and the production preparation work is satisfactory. Hearing this excellent result, people cannot help but warmly say to all those who participated in the construction of the First Automobile Plant and those who work at the First Automobile Plant: Congratulations, thank you, and we wish you to make great contributions to the construction of the second and third automobile plants of our motherland, and wish you to achieve greater achievements in the socialist construction of our motherland!

    After the Liberation brand automobiles are successfully assembled in trial production, the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant will soon begin mass production. At present, there are still some problems facing the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant: for example, because some important equipment has not arrived or has not been installed, the blanks of some parts are currently not manufactured by ourselves; in terms of the supply of steel and collaborative products, it is still not possible to fully meet the needs of automobile production. If these problems are not resolved in a timely and perfect manner, it will bring difficulties to formal production. Therefore, people also hope that those who are engaged in construction, those who are engaged in production, and those who manufacture collaborative products will make persistent efforts and strive to complete all the unfinished work to ensure that automobiles truly and entirely manufactured by our country will be produced in large quantities as soon as possible.

    解放牌汽车试装配成功
    王朴
    我国早就有了公路，也有了汽车，可是，这些汽车都不是我国自己制造的。多少年来，我国的一些工程技术人员，也曾经想用我们自己的手制造汽车，让我们自己制造的汽车在祖国的公路上行驶。但是在旧社会，这只不过是一个美丽的理想。只有现在，这个理想才变成了现实：我国第一汽车制造厂在试生产过程中装配出了第一批解放牌汽车，在不久之后就可以大量生产。这是我国工业建设的又一个光辉的成就，这是我国人民的一大喜讯！
    如果追溯一下汽车的历史，远的不说，就从1894年7月在巴黎举行汽车竞赛大会的时候算起，到现在也有六十多年了。在这样漫长的时间里，我国经历了大清王朝、北洋军阀和国民党反动派等朝代，都没有改变了我国工业落后的状况，一直是不能自己制造汽车。但是，中华人民共和国成立以后，从1953年7月15日开始动工建设第一汽车厂，到现在只有三年的时间，就建成了第一个汽车厂，并且在试生产当中装配出第一批解放牌汽车。这就意味着仅仅三年的时间，我们就已经填补了六十年来的空白。这个喜讯怎么能不令我们的人民和我们的朋友兴奋呢！
    汽车工业是考验一个国家工业技术水平的一种标志。以第一汽车厂要出产的解放牌载重汽车来说，它是由三千多种零件和合件组成的，它需要九百五十多种规格的钢材，全国有四十多个企业为它制造着四百多种协作产品。完全可以肯定：如果只依靠我国原有的薄弱的工业基础，要满足汽车生产的需要，那是绝对不行的。而现在之所以能够试制汽车，正说明我国工业几年来有了相当发展，技术水平有了相当提高。这些，是我国人民在党的领导下，在苏联和其他兄弟国家的援助下，作了巨大的努力，进行了创造性的劳动所取得的。
    试装配，对于第一汽车制造厂的建设和试生产来说也是一个严重的考试。考试的结果表明：第一汽车厂的建筑、安装工程质量是良好的；生产准备工作是及格的。听到这个优异的成绩，人们不能不热烈地向所有参加建设第一汽车厂人和参加第一汽车厂工作的人说：祝贺你们，谢谢你们，祝你们在为祖国的第二、第三汽车厂的建设当中作出巨大的贡献，祝你们在我们祖国的社会主义建设中取得更大的成就！
    解放牌汽车在试生产中装配成功以后，不久第一汽车制造厂就要开始成批生产了。当前，在第一汽车制造厂的面前还摆着一些问题：比如，由于个别重要设备没有到来或者没有安装上，以致有某些部件的毛胚目前还不是我们自己制造的；在钢材和协作产品的供应方面，也还不能完全满足汽车生产的需要。这些问题如果解决得不及时、不完善，就会给正式生产带来困难。因此，人们也希望建设的人，生产的人，制造协作产品的人，再接再厉，努力完成各项未完成的工作，保证真正全部是我国自己制造的汽车早日大批生产出来。
