A Tempest over a Short Essay
Ji Wan

On May 24th, a short essay in "Construction Site Life," the newspaper of the Central South Engineering Management Bureau's Party Committee, stirred up an interesting tempest.

The course of events was as follows.

On March 8th of this year, Zhu Fuyang and Xu Xichang, technicians from the 206 Construction Site of the Central South Second Engineering Company, put forward a rationalization proposal. The proposal suggested changing the original wooden rib framework for one-quarter of the partition walls to bamboo rib framework. This suggestion not only saved a large amount of timber but also reduced the cost by 189 yuan per ten cubic meters of framework. After repeated experiments, the technical supervisors of the Second Company and the technicians of the Central South Industrial Design Institute agreed to promote it.

On April 26th, the Second Company held an award meeting, preparing to issue bonuses to the proposers according to the "Provisional Regulations on Rewards for Inventions, Technical Improvements, and Rationalization Proposals Related to Production" promulgated by the Government Administration Council. At the meeting, it was calculated that this suggestion, if promoted only in the existing projects of the 206 Construction Site, could save the state more than 7,000 yuan. According to the reward regulations, a bonus of 229 yuan should be issued. Shao Kang, the manager of the Second Company, jumped up from his chair upon hearing this number and said, "Comrades, I would like to offer a small suggestion. This proposal is indeed good and can save the state a lot of money. Why not save the state even more money! How about giving the bonus at a discount?" Those present were first surprised, then amused, and finally rejected Manager Shao's "saving" idea.

A few days later, "Construction Site Life" newspaper received a short essay written by Zhu Fuyang entitled "The Manager's Shortsightedness," criticizing Manager Shao Kang's erroneous thinking as reflected in that meeting. To be cautious, the newspaper first sent a reporter to verify the facts and then sent the revised manuscript to the Party Committee Secretary of the Second Company for review. In addition to agreeing with the facts, they also discussed the matter with Manager Shao Kang. As soon as Manager Shao heard that Zhu Fuyang had written an article criticizing him, he couldn't help but exclaim angrily:

"Zhu Fuyang, you brat, you dare to write an article criticizing me! Hmph! With his kind of work, there are so many problems. I will write an article to the People's Daily to criticize him!" The company's Party Committee believed that Comrade Shao Kang's attitude toward criticism was incorrect and held a meeting to criticize him.

"Construction Site Life" newspaper published the short essay "The Manager's Shortsightedness" on May 24th. As soon as Manager Shao saw this short essay, he was furious, clutching the newspaper tightly in one hand and pounding the table vigorously with the other, shouting repeatedly: "This is outrageous! This is outrageous?!" Then, he summoned the Party Committee Secretary and the Chairman of the Trade Union, waving his fist in the face of the Party Committee Secretary and shouting, "Look, look! The reporter from 'Construction Site Life' dares to criticize me, Shao Kang! Good kid, I'll take his life!" Then he asked, "Is this reporter a Party member or a League member? Did he have a letter of introduction when he came to our company?" After repeated persuasion from the Party Committee Secretary and the Chairman of the Trade Union, Manager Shao's anger subsided a little. However, he continued to complain to the Party Committee, saying that it should not have "let go" of this article that "insulted" him. That day, Manager Shao wrote two letters to the newspaper. In the letter, he wrote:

"This morning, I saw the newspaper criticizing me in the form of a short essay. I want to ask you, what educational significance is there in publishing this kind of material? It only vents personal emotions and can only reduce the credibility of the Party newspaper…

"I keep thinking that I have not made any mistakes…"

The letter ended with a tone of sarcasm and threat: "I have already reflected my opinion to Director Zheng and Secretary Sun of the General Bureau. I do not agree with this kind of criticism. It's up to you to decide how to handle it!…"

On the third day (May 27th), the Yangtze Daily published another short essay about this dispute. After seeing it, Manager Shao beat his chest and stomped his feet, shouting, "This is outrageous, the Yangtze Daily is also criticizing me!?" This time, Manager Shao's "self-cultivation" seemed to be a little better. He did not want to take the Yangtze Daily reporter's "life." In order to "avoid constituting the mistake of resisting newspaper criticism," he even wrote a "self-criticism."

Just as Comrade Shao Kang's self-criticism was finished, the responsible comrades and reporters from "Construction Site Life" newspaper walked into the manager's office. This time, Manager Shao's attitude was very good. He revealed in his words: "This storm was mainly caused by the Party Committee Secretary, but the Party Committee Secretary is still young and does not have as long a revolutionary struggle history as him, so he can 'forgive' him." He also said that the newspaper's criticism was good. At this time, the company's Deputy Manager Ni Pengju entered the scene, and Manager Shao left the scene.

As soon as Deputy Manager Ni entered the scene, he said angrily to the responsible comrade of "Construction Site Life" newspaper: "Your criticism is completely untrue. Manager Shao never said anything about discounting the bonus, it's simply fabricated!" After the person in charge of the "Construction Site Life" newspaper explained the situation of handling this manuscript to him, Deputy Manager Ni still stubbornly insisted: "Go and listen to the reactions of the masses!"

"What about the criticism in the Yangtze Daily?" the responsible comrade of "Construction Site Life" newspaper asked. "That's not true either!" Deputy Manager Ni Pengju replied categorically. It is very clear that although the ways they expressed themselves are different, their purpose is the same: to not admit their erroneous attitude towards rationalization proposals, and to not admit their erroneous attitude towards the criticism of the masses.

    一篇小品文引起的风波
    季万
    五月二十四日，中南工程管理总局党委机关报“工地生活”上的一篇小品文引起了一场有趣的风波。
    事情经过情形是这样的。
    今年三月八日，中南第二工程公司206工地的技术员朱复杨和许锡昌提出了一项合理化建议。建议将四分之一的间隔墙原用的木筋框架压墙改为竹筋框架压墙。这项建议不仅能节约大量的木材，而且使每十立方框架可以降低成本189元。经过多次试验后，二公司技术主管人员和中南工业设计院的技术人员都同意推广。
    四月二十六日，二公司举行了评奖会议，准备按政务院颁发的“有关生产的发明，技术改进及合理化建议的奖励暂行条例”发给建议人的奖金。会上计算了一下，这项建议仅在206工地现有的工程中推广，就可以为国家节约七千多元的资金，按奖励条例规定，应该发奖金229元。二公司的邵康经理一听到这个数字，从椅子上跳了起来，说：“同志们，我发表一点小意见，这项建议的确是好，能为国家节约许多资金。索性再为国家多节约一点钱吧！把奖金打个折扣发好不好？”到会的人听完邵经理的发言后，先是惊奇，后是好笑，最后否定了邵经理这个“节约”的意见。
    几天以后，“工地生活”报收到了朱复杨写的以“经理的近视眼”为题的小品文，批评了邵康经理在那次会议上所反映出来的错误思想。为了慎重，报社先派记者对照了事实，而后把修改好的稿子送给二公司党委书记去看。他们除在事实上同意了外，并且把这件事和邵康经理谈了一下。邵经理一听朱复杨写稿批评他，不禁愤愤地嚷道：
  “朱复杨你这小子，竟敢写稿批评我！哼！凭他那个样，工作上毛病那样多，我还要写稿到人民日报去批评他呢！”公司党委会认为邵康同志对待批评的态度不正确，召开会议批评了他。
    “工地生活”报在五月二十四日把“经理的近视眼”这篇小品文发表了。邵经理一看到这篇小品文，气得暴跳如雷，一只手紧捏着这份报纸，一只手使劲地捶打着桌面，嘴里不住地吼叫着：“这还了得！这还了得？！”随后，他把党委书记和工会主席找来，冲着党委书记的脸挥舞着拳头叫道：“你看，你看！‘工地生活’报的记者居然批评到我邵康头上来了。好小子，老子要他的命！”接着他又问：“这个记者是党员，还是团员？到我们公司来有没有介绍信？”经过党委书记和工会主席再三劝说之后，邵经理火气平息了一点。但是他还在不断地埋怨党委，不应该把这篇“侮辱”他的文章“放过去”了。当天邵经理写了两封信寄给了报社。他在信中写道：
      “今天上午，我看到报纸以小品文形式批评了我。我要问你们，登这种材料有什么教育意义呢？只是发泄了一下个人的情绪，只能降低党报威信……。
    “我反复想着我没有什么错误，……”
    信中最后还以连挖苦带威胁的口吻说：“我已向总局郑局长和孙书记反映了我的意见，我是不同意这样批评的，如何处理，你们看吧！……”
    第三天（五月二十七日）长江日报就这个纠纷又发表了一篇小品文。邵经理看到以后，捶胸顿足地直叫：“这还了得，长江日报也批评起我来了！？”这次，邵经理的“修养”似乎是好了一点。没有要长江日报记者的“命”，为了“怕构成抗拒报纸批评的错误”，他还写了“自我检讨”。
    邵康同志的检讨刚写好，“工地生活”报的负责同志和记者走进了经理室。这次邵经理的态度很好，他言语之间透露出：这次风波主要是由党委书记引起的，但是党委书记年纪还轻，革命斗争历史没有他长，所以他能够‘原谅’他。”他并且表示说，报纸的批评是好的。这时，公司的倪鹏举副经理上场，邵经理便下场。
    倪副经理一上场，就怒气冲冲地对“工地生活”报的负责同志说：“你们的批评完全不是事实。邵经理根本没有说奖金打折扣的话，简直是捏造！”当“工地生活”报的负责人向他说明了处理这篇稿件的情况后，倪副经理仍旧固执己见地说：“你们去听听群众的反映吧！”
  “那么长江日报的批评呢？”“工地生活”报负责同志问。“那也不是事实！”倪鹏举副经理斩钉截铁地回答。事情很明显，他们两个表现的方式虽然不同，但是目的是一个：不承认自己对合理化建议所采取的错误态度，不承认自己对群众批评所采取的错误态度。
