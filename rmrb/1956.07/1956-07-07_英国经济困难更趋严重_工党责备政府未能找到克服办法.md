Xinhua News Agency, London, July 6th: The British House of Commons held a debate on July 3rd regarding the Labour Party's criticism of the Conservative Party government's fiscal and economic policies.

    Wilson, the Labour Party's main spokesman on economic affairs, said that Britain's industrial production had sharply declined, the price of the pound had fallen below par, and export trade was being resisted by import cuts from Australia, Britain's largest customer.

    Wilson also accused the government's so-called "anti-inflation measures" to limit domestic consumption of causing a depression in the automotive industry. Recently, the automotive industry has been experiencing successive mass layoffs and reductions in working hours. British Motor Corporation alone laid off 6,000 workers last week.

    The Labour Party blames the government for not being able to find a way to overcome Britain's current economic difficulties. It has put forward a motion of censure stating that the government's recent announcement of cutting government spending by 76 million pounds is not a solution to the economic problem.

    When defending the government's policies, British Chancellor of the Exchequer Macmillan acknowledged the seriousness of inflation in Britain. He said that if this problem is not solved, long-term and large-scale unemployment will inevitably occur. However, he disagreed with the notion that the British economy is in danger of a total recession. He argued that in the first half of this year, Britain's foreign trade, including tangible trade and "intangible exports" such as shipping, insurance, and investment income, is estimated to have a surplus of no less than 100 million pounds. He said, "This is not enough, but it is still encouraging."

    After the debate, the Conservative Party majority in the House of Commons rejected the Labour Party's motion of censure by a vote of 310 to 239.

    英国经济困难更趋严重
    工党责备政府未能找到克服办法
    新华社6日讯　伦敦消息：英国下院在七月三日就工党对保守党政府财政经济政策的批评展开辩论。
    英国工党在经济事务方面的主要发言人威尔逊说，英国的工业生产已经急剧下降，英镑价格已经跌到平价以下，而出口贸易又正在受到英国的最大主顾澳大利亚削减进口的抵制。
    威尔逊还指责政府限制国内消费的所谓“反通货膨胀措施”引起了汽车工业的萧条。汽车工业最近一个时期以来接连发生大批解雇工人和缩减工时的现象。仅英国汽车公司一家企业在上个星期就解雇了六千名工人。
    工党责备政府没有能够找出办法来克服英国当前的经济困难。它提出一项谴责案说，最近政府宣布的削减政府开支七千六百万英镑的措施，并不是解决经济问题的办法。
    英国财政大臣麦克米伦在为政府政策辩护的时候，承认了英国通货膨胀的严重情况。他说，如果不解决这个问题，就不可避免地会发生长期和大规模的失业。但是，他不同意认为英国经济正处在总衰退的危险之中的说法。他辩解说，今年上半年英国的对外贸易，包括有形贸易和航运、保险、投资收入等“无形输出”，估计要有不下于一亿英镑的盈余。他说，“这是不够的，但是还是很令人鼓舞的”。
    辩论结束以后，下院的保守党多数以三百一十票对二百三十九票否决了工党的谴责案。
