Shameless Forgery
Cui Qi

In recent months, reactionary elements in Hong Kong and Japan have successively forged the Beijing "People's Daily." The paper and printing of these fake "People's Daily" newspapers are very poor, and the writing on a single newspaper is both vertically and horizontally arranged, which is extremely chaotic. On these fake "People's Daily" newspapers, the reactionaries fabricated "Xinhua News Agency dispatches," "Xinhua News Agency special dispatches," "special articles," and signed articles, maliciously slandering the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese people. This is truly an outrageous and shameless act!

According to Hong Kong newspapers, many overseas compatriots have received this fake "People's Daily" from the region. On May 28th, the Japanese "Akahata" (Red Flag) also revealed that the fake "People's Daily" they received only had a "Tokyo" postmark and not a "Beijing" postmark. This shows that these fake "People's Daily" newspapers are being produced on a large scale in certain places outside mainland China. This is an organized conspiracy by elements hostile to the Chinese people.

Today, in the face of the radiant New China, the reactionaries feel that if they openly come out to slander the Chinese people, they will be even more unlucky. Therefore, they have to hide in dark corners and use this trick of passing off fish eyes as pearls, falsely using the name of the Chinese people to slander the Chinese people. What clumsy ways these ghosts who fear the sunlight are using to announce their dead end!

However, there is another type of person who actually openly impersonates the "People's Daily" to spread rumors. The Japanese "Mainichi Shimbun" has done this. On May 26th of this year, "Mainichi Shimbun" published two photos, one supposedly reprinted from the June 26, 1955, "People's Daily" "Foreign Edition," showing a group photo of Chairman Mao Zedong, President Ho Chi Minh, and other leaders of the Chinese and Vietnamese governments; the other supposedly reprinted from the same day's "People's Daily" "Domestic Edition," showing the same group photo of Chinese and Vietnamese government leaders, but with Japanese Communist Party leader Nosaka Sanzo also included. "Mainichi Shimbun" then made a big fuss about it, saying that it had found "evidence" "proving" that Nosaka Sanzo had been living in China for the past few years...

As journalists, there is nothing more shameful than spreading rumors. Anyone who knows the "People's Daily" knows that the "People's Daily" does not have "Domestic Edition" or "Foreign Edition." Tachibana Yoshimori, a member of the editorial board of "Mainichi Shimbun," visited China last year as a member of the Japanese journalists delegation. Therefore, it is completely unbelievable that the editors of "Mainichi Shimbun" did not know this. However, "Mainichi Shimbun" blatantly lied and crudely altered the "People's Daily" photo, adding the photo of Nosaka Sanzo, which is simply a lack of basic journalistic ethics.

The purpose of "Mainichi Shimbun" in doing this is very obvious. It wants to use rumor-mongering to attack the leaders of the Japanese Communist Party, and at the same time, it wants to spread an atmosphere of distrust between the Chinese and Japanese people. However, the life of rumors is ultimately short, and the rumor-mongering tactics of "Mainichi Shimbun" will only result in the disgrace of its own reputation.

    无耻的伪造
    崔奇
    最近几个月，在香港和日本接连出现反动派伪造的北京“人民日报”。这些假的“人民日报”的纸张和印刷都很坏，一张报上的行文有直排又有横排，非常混乱。反动派在这些假的“人民日报”上凭空捏造了一些“新华社讯”、“新华社特讯”、“专载”和署名文章，对中国共产党和中国人民进行恶毒的诽谤。这真是令人愤慨的无耻行径！
    据香港报纸报道，不少海外同胞都接到这种来自当地的假“人民日报”。五月二十八日，日本“赤旗报”也揭露说，他们收到的假“人民日报”只有“东京”的邮戳，而没有“北京”的邮戳。由此可见，这些假“人民日报”是在中国大陆以外的某些地方大规模制造出来的。这是一个敌视中国人民的有组织的阴谋活动。
    今天，在光芒万丈的新中国面前，反动派已经感到，如果公开露面出来诽谤中国人民，他们就会更加倒霉。于是，他们只好躲在阴暗的角落里，使用这种鱼目混珠的伎俩，假冒中国人民的名义来诽谤中国人民。这些害怕阳光的鬼魅们是用多么拙劣的方式来宣告他们的穷途末路！
    但是，也有另外一种人，居然公开假冒“人民日报”的名义来造谣。日本的“每日新闻”就干过这种事。今年五月二十六日，“每日新闻”登了两张照片，一张据说是转载1955年6月26日“人民日报”“国外版”的，上边是毛泽东主席、胡志明主席以及中越两国政府的其他领导人员的合影；另一张据说是转载同一天“人民日报”“国内版”的，上边除了中越两国政府领导人员之外，还有日共领袖野坂参三。于是“每日新闻”就大做其文章，说什么它已经找到“证据”，“证明”野坂参三这几年来一直住在中国……。
    作为新闻工作者来说，没有什么比造谣更可耻的事了。凡是知道“人民日报”的人都知道，“人民日报”根本没有什么“国内版”“国外版”之分。“每日新闻”的社论委员橘善守曾经在去年作为日本新闻工作者代表团的一员访问过中国。因此，要说“每日新闻”的编辑部不知道这一点，是完全说不过去的。但是“每日新闻”竟硬说谎话，而且把“人民日报”的照片粗鲁地加以涂改，加上野坂参三的照片，这简直连起码的新闻道德也没有了。
    “每日新闻”这种做法的目的是很明显的。它想用造谣中伤的手段来打击日共领导人员，同时也想在中日两国人民之间散布不信任的空气。可是，谣言的寿命总归是不长久的，“每日新闻”这种造谣中伤的手段，结果只会使它自己的名誉扫地而已。
