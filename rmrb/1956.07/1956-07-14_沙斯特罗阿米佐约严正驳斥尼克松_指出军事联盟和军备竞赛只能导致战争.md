Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, July 13th: Indonesian Prime Minister Sastroamidjojo issued a written statement regarding Nixon's remarks criticizing neutralism, stating that history has proven that arms races only lead to war.

The Prime Minister's statement was read by Information Minister Sudibjo at a press conference on July 12th.

The statement said, "'Neutralism' policy has increasingly become a topic of discussion internationally and among the public. Previously, the public reaction of some politicians who opposed the policy of non-alignment was to issue skeptical or even hostile statements. However, after President Sukarno's visit to the United States and Europe, I am pleased to note that, in addition to criticism, there seems to be even some implicit recognition in various places when publicly evaluating this policy that it is correct for some countries to adhere to their active and independent foreign policy."

The statement, referring to Nixon's remarks in Manila, said, "However, there are some issues, especially regarding the moral aspects of 'neutralism,' that need further clarification. I personally would like to offer the following explanation in the hope of dispelling misunderstandings, confusion, or controversies about 'neutralism' among some people in the world, as this issue has sparked detailed public debate among prominent politicians worldwide.

"The Indonesian government's active and independent foreign policy is the result of the interaction of domestic conditions, domestic needs, and national characteristics reflected in the international aspects of world affairs. It means that we are not staying neutral in a war like some European countries did in the last war. We are simply trying to prevent the next war from happening, because we believe that the result of the next war will only be the destruction of human civilization. Ideologically, we are not neutral either, because we adhere to the Pancasila (belief in God, nationalism, humanitarianism, social justice, and democracy) as the basic code of conduct in our national life."

"The reason why other countries oppose our attitude on international issues may be the fact that we proceed from the principle of responding to the friendly gestures of other countries with the same sincerity, regardless of political systems. Implementing any political system – be it parliamentary democracy or any other – does not guarantee sympathy and support from long-established countries if it means that these countries will lose the monopoly and dominance they have in their former colonies."

Sastroamidjojo said, "Regarding the concept of using military alliances as a means of avoiding war, based on the experience gained throughout human history, it is now very clear that the result of an arms race will only be war."

The statement believes that the ten principles adopted by the Asian-African Conference as guiding principles for international relations, if implemented, will serve as an example of the willingness of countries with different social or political systems to coexist peacefully. The statement concludes by arguing that "in this atomic stalemate, the chances of peace would increase if military alliances were transformed into organizations for close economic cooperation and, ultimately, technical assistance."

### 沙斯特罗阿米佐约严正驳斥尼克松  指出军事联盟和军备竞赛只能导致战争

    沙斯特罗阿米佐约严正驳斥尼克松
    指出军事联盟和军备竞赛只能导致战争
    新华社雅加达13日电　印度尼西亚总理沙斯特罗阿米佐约就尼克松的抨击中立主义的谈话发表书面声明说，历史已经证明，军备竞赛只会导致战争。
    总理的声明是七月十二日由情报部长苏迪比约在记者招待会上宣读的。
    声明说，“‘中立主义’政策已经越来越成为在国际上和公众中间讨论的问题。以前，一些反对不参加联盟的政策的政治家的公开反应是发表怀疑的甚至是敌视的声明，而在苏加诺总统访问了美国和欧洲以后，我满意地注意到，除了批评以外，各地似乎甚至有人在公开地评价这种政策的时候也暗中承认某些国家坚持它们的积极的、独立的外交政策是正确的。”
    声明在提到尼克松在马尼拉的谈话以后说，“但是，有一些问题，特别是关于‘中立主义’的道德问题需要进一步阐明。我个人愿意作如下的阐述，希望能消除世界上某些人士对于‘中立主义’的误解，或是混乱和争论。因为这个问题已引起世界上的著名政治家的详尽的公开的辩论。
      “印度尼西亚政府的积极的独立的外交政策是国内条件、国内需要和民族特点的相互作用反映到世界事务的国际方面的结果。它意味着，我们不是像一些欧洲国家在上次战争中那样，在战争中守中立。我们只是尽力防止发生下一次的战争，因为，我们相信下次战争的结果只会是人类文明的毁灭。在意识形态方面来说，我们也不是中立的，因为我们信奉五基（神道、民族主义、人道主义、社会正义和民主）作为我们国家生活中行为的基本准则。”
    “其他国家反对我们在国际问题上的态度的原因也许是这个事实：我们是从不管政治制度的不同，以同样的诚恳来回答其他国家的友好姿态这一原则出发的。实行任何政治制度——不管是议会民主的还是其他的——并不能保证得到那些立国已久的国家的同情和支持，如果这意味着会使这些国家丧失它们在前殖民地国家中所拥有的垄断和支配势力的话。”
    沙斯特罗阿米佐约说，“关于以军事联盟作为避免战争的手段这个概念，根据在人类历史的整个过程中所获得的经验，现在已经很明显，军备竞赛的结果只会是战争。”
    声明认为，亚非会议通过的作为国际关系的指导原则的十项原则，如果实行的话，将成为希望不同社会或政治制度的国家和平共处的意志的范例。声明最后认为，“在这个原子僵持局面中，如果把军事联盟转变成为进行密切的经济合作和最后进行技术援助的组织的话，和平的可能性就会增加”。
