    Fujian is the Province with the Most Forests in Southeastern China
    Broadleaf and Shrub Species Equal Four Times That of All of Europe
    (Our Newspaper's report) According to the Fujian Daily: The actual reserves of forests in Fujian Province amount to approximately 250 million cubic meters, greatly exceeding the original estimate of 120 million cubic meters, making it the province with the most forests in East and Central South China. This figure was recently calculated by the Forest Survey Team of the Provincial Forestry Department after field surveys.
    A forest survey team of more than 200 people from the Fujian Provincial Forestry Department, starting in 1953 and continuing until the first half of this year, spent more than three years completing forest resource surveys of over 3.4 million hectares in the main forest areas (namely Nanping and the former Jianyang and Yong'an special districts). The total forest reserves in the province amount to approximately 250 million cubic meters, of which more than 75% are in the vigorous growth stage. These nearly mature and middle-aged forests are a valuable asset for our country's socialist construction period. The survey not only revealed that Fujian Province has abundant forest reserves but also discovered that there are extremely many tree species. It is understood that there are approximately one thousand species of broadleaf and shrub trees in the province, a figure equal to four times the total number of tree species in the whole of Europe. Among these numerous tree species, coniferous trees (such as pine and fir), which grow quickly, have a high yield, and are of great economic value, account for 65% of the total reserves in the province.

    福建是我国东南部森林最多的省份
    乔灌木树种等于全欧洲的四倍
    本报讯　据福建日报报道：福建省森林的实际蓄积量达二亿五千万立方公尺左右，大大超过了原来一亿二千万立方公尺的估计，成为华东、中南地区森林最多的一个省份。这是省林业厅林野调查队最近经过实地调查计算出来的数字。
    福建省林业厅二百多人组成的一支森林勘测队伍，从1953年开始至今年上半年止，前后三年多时间在主要林区（即南平和原建阳、永安三个专区）完成了三百四十余万公顷的森林资源调查工作。全省森林蓄积量计达二亿五千万立方公尺左右，其中75％以上的蓄积量正是生长旺盛的发育时期，这些近熟林和中龄林是我国社会主义建设时期的宝贵资财。调查中不但发现福建省拥有雄厚的森林蓄积量，同时也发现林木树种极多。据了解，全省乔灌木的树种约有千种，这个数字等于整个欧洲全部树种的四倍；在这些繁多的树类中，生长快、出材率高、经济价值大的针叶树（如松、杉等）占全省总蓄积量65％。
