    A Precious Unique Copy
    "Collected Interpretations of the Songs of Chu"

    (Our Dispatch) The Nanjing University Library recently acquired an extremely precious Wanli edition (Ming Dynasty) of "Collected Interpretations of the Songs of Chu." This book was written by Wang Yuan during the Jiajing period of the Ming Dynasty. The entire book consists of twelve volumes in two cases, with a preface by Jiao Ruohou (Hong), a famous Confucian scholar of the Ming Dynasty, at the beginning of the first volume. This book is of great value for the study of ancient Chinese culture.

    This book is a unique copy in China. It was originally collected by Wang Shoushan of Jiufeng Old Residence in Hangzhou, and later purchased by Wen Zhi Bookstore in Shanghai. In March of this year, Wang Pijiang, a professor in the Chinese Department of Nanjing University, purchased it at a high price and donated it to the university library.

    Last year, You Guoen, a professor in the Chinese Department of Peking University, wrote to Professor Hatano of Yokohama University in Japan, entrusting him to search for a copy of "Collected Interpretations of the Songs of Chu" in Japan, because he could not find a complete copy of the book in China. After receiving the letter, Professor Hatano searched extensively and finally found a complete copy in the Ueno Library. The Kanagawa Prefecture Teachers and Staff Union mobilized more than 16,000 members to donate money to film the book. Last December, during the visit of the Chinese Scientific Delegation to Japan, they entrusted the head of the delegation, President Guo Moruo, and delegation member Professor Jian Bozan, to bring back a set each of the film and photographs of the complete "Collected Interpretations of the Songs of Chu," and presented them to Peking University and Professor You Guoen respectively. This shows how rare the book "Collected Interpretations of the Songs of Chu" is. (Ji)

    一本珍贵的孤本
    “楚辞集解”
    本报讯　南京大学图书馆最近得到一部极珍贵的明代万历本“楚辞集解”。这是明代嘉靖年间汪瑗所著。全书两函共十二册，卷首有明代名儒焦弱侯（竑）的序文。这本书对研究中国古代文化有重要的价值。
    这本书是海内孤本，原为杭州王绶珊氏九峰旧庐所藏，后由上海温知书店收买。今年三月，由南京大学中文系教授汪辟疆以重价购得，现捐赠给该校图书馆。
    去年，北京大学中文系教授游国恩，因在国内没有搜集到足本的“楚辞集解”，曾写信给日本横滨大学教授波多野，委托他在日本搜访“楚辞集解”一书。波多野教授接信后，经多方搜寻，才在上野图书馆找到一部足本。日本神奈川县教职员工会动员了一万六千多会员，捐款把该书摄制成影片，于去年十二月趁中国访日科学代表团在日本访问之便，委托团长郭沫若院长、团员翦伯赞教授，携回足本“楚辞集解”影片及照片各一套，分别赠送给北京大学及游国恩教授。“楚辞集解”一书的难得，由此可见。　　　　　　　（季）
