Guangdong Province, a nationally renowned jute-producing area, has expanded its jute planting area by more than 76,000 mu this year. Preliminary estimates indicate an increase in production of more than 20% compared to last year. Currently, in the fertile fields of the Pearl River and Jian River downstream counties, jute plants have generally grown to a height of seven to eight chi. The "Indian Yuanguo" improved jute variety, which has been promoted on more than 145,000 mu throughout the province this year, is growing very well. The 310 mu of jute in the Shuisesyong Agricultural Cooperative in Dongguan County, led by the famous jute production model Yuan Linda, has reached a height of more than one zhang due to the adoption of advanced cultivation techniques such as improved varieties, early sowing, close planting with full seedlings, and strengthened field management. It is estimated that the average yield per mu will be 978 jin.

The jute harvest season is approaching, and jute farmers in various places are stepping up their efforts in irrigation, fertilization, and disease and pest control in the later stages of field management. The agricultural departments are also preparing to select and retain a large number of excellent jute seeds in the main producing areas in order to continue to promote and supply them to Guangxi, Zhejiang, Hubei and other provinces next year.
