    Nobody Needs This Kind of "Support"
    By our reporter Cao Baoming
    Supporting others is a good thing in itself, but I recently heard about a case where someone was "supported" to the point of complaining bitterly. This spring, the Wuhan Food Company went to the countryside and "supported" the farmers by selling them preserved meat and apples on credit. The farmers didn't want to buy on credit, but the company personnel repeatedly persuaded them, and some even said that this was a "Central decision" and that the farmers had to accept this "support." Think about it, since the "Central Committee" decided to support agricultural cooperation, and the state-owned company personnel were so diligent in delivering goods to their door, how could they not accept this "support"? As a result, the Wuhan Food Company sold 150,000 catties of preserved meat on credit to the farmers in Hanqiao District, worth more than 100,000 yuan.
    Originally, the Wuhan Food Company had been accumulating large quantities of unsold preserved meat every year after the Spring Festival. Last year, in April and May, they converted many fruit stalls into preserved meat stalls to promote the sale of preserved meat, so that citizens could smell the salty and fishy smell of preserved meat everywhere in this warm spring season, feeling nauseous and complaining a lot. This year, they used this method to "support" the farmers, which not only completed the "support" task, but also sold the accumulated preserved meat, and was not subject to criticism from the people in the city, which was not "killing three birds with one stone"?
    Just as they were rejoicing about this, the farmers also did some calculations: it is very difficult to increase agricultural production by 10%, but the preserved meat bought on credit by the farmers of Qianjin Township this year is equivalent to 120,000 catties of rice, accounting for 10% of the township's total annual income. In other words, if the farmers in this township worked hard all year and increased production by 10%, this increase would be eaten up by the city's food company "supporting" them to eat preserved meat. Therefore, the farmers are very annoyed and demand that "these good things should bother us less in the future."
    The Hubei Provincial Finance and Economics Conference mentioned the three-step process of some commercial departments selling off accumulated commodities: commercial personnel first examine themselves for making unrealistic plans, resulting in a large number of commodities being accumulated; secondly, they mobilize the masses to help them sell these commodities, "supporting" national industrialization; and finally, they allocate and apportion the commodities. "Support" is also mentioned here, but this is just some commercial personnel forcing you to complete the "support" task.
    Everyone has a share in supporting national industrialization. Now that state-owned companies have accumulated a large number of unsold commodities and cannot complete the capital accumulation task, it will affect national industrialization. Can you sit idly by? Can you not do your best to support it? With this logic, if the commercial department's mooncakes and assorted candies are accumulated, the Miaoqian District of Dangyang County stipulates that each township cadre must eat two tubes of mooncakes and five catties of assorted candies, regardless of whether you like it or not. If preserved meat is accumulated, Changyang County stipulates that each of the more than 4,000 migrant workers building roads must eat one catty of preserved meat. What if they don't eat it? There is a way, fresh meat will not be supplied. If double-share plows are accumulated, Bailizhou District of Yidu County stipulates that each agricultural cooperative must purchase one double-share plow for every 120 mu of land, otherwise other agricultural tools will not be supplied. Many representatives at the Finance and Economics Conference severely criticized these commercial units.
    Originally, the meaning of "support" is to do your best to help others, and to help others voluntarily. Whether you are going to support others or accept support from others, it does not contain any coercion.

### 谁也不需要这种“支援”

    谁也不需要这种“支援”
    本报记者　曹葆铭
    支援别人，这本是好事，但是我最近却听了桩将别人“支援”得叫起苦来的事情。今年春天，武汉市食品公司下乡，用赊货的方式“支援”农民吃腊肉，吃苹果。农民不想赊购，公司人员便三番五次地劝说农民，有的人员还说这是“中央的决定”，非要农民接受这种“支援”不可。请想想，既然“中央决定”支援农业合作化，国营公司的人员又这样勤勤恳恳送货上门，还能不接受这种“支援”么？这样一来，武汉市食品公司便向汉桥区的农民赊销了十五万斤腊肉，价值十万多元。
    本来，武汉市食品公司每过春节后都积压大批腊肉销不出去。去年四、五月里，他们将许多水果摊改为腊肉摊推销腊肉，使市民在此春暖花开的季节里，随处都闻到又咸又腥的腊肉味，恶心想吐，怨声很多。他们今年用这办法“支援”农民，既完成了“支援”任务，又推销了积压的腊肉，还不受市内人民的指责，岂不是“一举三得”？
    当他们正为这事庆幸的时候，农民也算了笔账：农业生产要增产一成是很不容易的，但前进乡农民今年赊购的腊肉折合稻谷十二万斤，占全乡全年收入的10％，也就是说，如果这乡农民今年辛苦一年增产了一成，这增产的部分就被市食品公司“支援”他们吃腊肉给吃掉了。所以农民很恼火，要求“这些好事以后少关照我们一点”。
    湖北省财经会议上曾谈到某些商业部门派销积压商品的三部曲：商业人员首先检讨自己订计划不合实际，造成大批商品积压；其次便动员群众替他们推销这些商品，“支援”国家工业化；最后便分派、摊销。这里也提到“支援”，不过这是某些商业人员硬要你来完成“支援”任务而已。
    支援国家工业化，人人有份，国营公司现在积压大批商品销不出去，完不成资金积累任务，便对国家工业化有影响，你能坐视不管么？你能不尽自己力量支援么？有了这种逻辑以后，商业部门的月饼、杂糖积压了，当阳县庙前区便规定每个乡干部得吃月饼二筒、杂糖五斤，而不论你喜欢不喜欢。腊肉积压了，长阳县就规定修公路的四千多民工每人得吃一斤腊肉，不吃怎么样？有办法，不供应鲜肉。双铧犁积压了，宜都县百里洲区便规定农业社每120亩地得购双铧犁一部，否则便不供应别的农具。许多代表在财经会上对这些商业单位提出了严厉的批评。
    本来，“支援”的含义是尽自己力量去帮助别人，并且是自觉自愿地帮助别人。无论是你去支援别人，还是接受别人支援，都绝不含任何强迫的意思。
