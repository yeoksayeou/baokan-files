    Suggest Raising Pigs in Forest Areas
    I work in the forest area for grain work. Recently, I received letters from the staff and masses in the forest area requesting our grain department to supply them with some pig feed. I think their request is correct and I hope the higher authorities will support it.
    Forest areas have many favorable conditions for raising pigs: there are many wild vegetables, which can be used as part of the feed; the swill left over from the staff's usual meals can also be used to feed pigs; most of the staff in the forest area are from rural areas, and they all have the habit and experience of raising pigs; many staff family members, although they cannot engage in forestry production, can engage in the sideline production of raising pigs.
    Raising pigs in forest areas is beneficial to the country and the vast number of employees in forest areas. It can produce more pigs for the country and meet the needs of the vast number of employees. Although the commercial departments in forest areas supply a lot of meat, it still cannot meet the growing needs of the vast number of employees. Especially in summer, fresh pork from outside cannot be transported, and it is difficult to eat meat.

    建议在林区养猪
    我是在林区作粮食工作的，最近接到林区职工群众来信，要求我们粮食部门供应他们部分养猪饲料。我认为他们这个要求是对的，希望上级主管部门予以支持。
    林区具有很多养猪的有利条件：野菜多，可以作为一部分饲料；职工平常作饭剩下的泔水，也能够喂猪；林区大部分职工是从农村来的，他们都有养猪的习惯和经验；许多职工家属，虽不能从事林业生产，却可以从事养猪的副业生产。
    在林区养猪，对国家和林区广大职工都是有利的。能够为国家多生产生猪，又能满足广大职工的需要。目前虽然林区商业部门供应了很多食肉，但是总满足不了广大职工日益增长的生活需要。尤其是夏季，外边的鲜猪肉运不来，很难吃到肉。
