Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, July 18th. The grain departments of Sichuan Province have recently promoted a batch of tools for grain storage, most of which were created by grain warehouse keepers at the grassroots level throughout the province. The person in charge of the Sichuan Provincial Grain Bureau said that after the promotion of these tools, the efficiency of insect removal in the province's grain will be greatly improved, and a lot of labor will be saved.

    The "linear continuous windmill" created by the Nanbu County grain department, as long as a transmission frame is installed and the windmill shafts are connected with belts, can be driven by one person to drive sixteen windmills. In this way, one person can replace the work of seven to twelve people, and can blow more than 100,000 jin of grain a day, with an insect removal efficiency of more than 92%.

    The grain dryer created by the Peng County Grain Bureau can evaporate the moisture in the grain during the winter or rainy season when the grain becomes damp, without the grain deteriorating.

    The hand-cranked warehouse loading machine created by the Chengguan District Grain Depot in Mingshan County can avoid the danger of workers climbing high into the warehouse. As long as one person cranks the machine, the grain can be transported to warehouses as high as three meters. It can deliver more than 18,000 jin of grain per hour; it can also be combined with a sieve to remove insects, which works very well.

    The Sichuan Provincial Grain Bureau has made these creations into models and pictures, which will be promoted and introduced to the grain system throughout the province.

    保管粮食的先进工具
    新华社成都18日电　四川省粮食部门最近推广了一批保管粮食的工具，这些工具大都是各地基层粮食仓库保管人员创造的。四川省粮食厅负责人说，这些工具推广以后，将使全省粮食除虫效率大大提高，并可节省许多劳动力。
    南部县粮食部门创造的“直线式连环风车”，只要安上一个传动架，将风车轴用皮带接在一起，一人踏动，就可带动十六架风车。这样一人可代替七个到十二个人的工作，一天可风吹粮食十万多斤，除虫效率在92％以上。
    彭县粮食局创造的粮食烘干机，可以在冬天或霉雨季节，当粮食发潮时，把粮食中的水份蒸发出去，而粮食并不变质。
    名山县城关区粮库创造的手摇上仓机，能避免工人登高上仓的危险，只要一人摇动机器，就可把粮食传送到高达三公尺的仓库里去，每小时可送粮食一万八千多斤；同时还可结合溜筛除虫，效果很好。
    四川省粮食厅已把这些创造制成模型和图片，将向全省粮食系统推广介绍。
