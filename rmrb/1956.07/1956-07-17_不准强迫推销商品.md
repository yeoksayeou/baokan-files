It has come to light recently that commercial departments and supply and marketing cooperatives in some areas of Hubei, Anhui and other provinces have been forcing agricultural production cooperatives to purchase or purchase on credit goods such as sweets, pastries, cured meat, thermos flasks, radios, health kits, etc. When farmers are unwilling to buy, saying: “Our cooperative has only just been set up, we don’t plan to buy these things.”, those forcing them to buy goods say: “This is an order from above! If you don’t buy, how will the sales targets be met? If the sales targets cannot be met, where will the funds for building socialism come from?” As a result, agricultural cooperatives, in order to love their socialist country, have no choice but to take the goods.

Naturally, the farmers are very dissatisfied with this matter. In Qianjin Township in the suburbs of Wuhan, Hubei, they were forced to buy on credit cured meat worth 120,000 jin of rice, accounting for one-tenth of the township's annual income. Xingfu Agricultural Production Cooperative in Langxi County, Anhui Province, was forced to buy on credit more than 4,800 jin of sweets, equivalent to more than 70,000 jin of rice. When the farmers calculate this bill, and remember that they have not yet received the rice, they already owe so much debt, they cannot help but feel disheartened. Those who were originally enthusiastic about production no longer want to go to the fields, and some people's enthusiasm for running cooperatives is also waning.

The comrades in the commercial and supply and marketing departments work hard and bring goods to the countryside. Why is it that their efforts are not appreciated? The reason is very simple, because the goods do not meet the needs of the farmers. Agricultural production cooperatives have just been set up, and they lack this and that. They originally hoped that the commercial departments and supply and marketing departments would sell them some of the things they need. For example, to increase production, they need some commercial fertilizers; when it rains and they go to the fields, they need raincoats and hats; after digging many wells, they need livestock to pull water carts, etc. However, many of the goods that the comrades in the commercial and supply and marketing departments bring are not suitable. The things the farmers need are not available or are very few, while a large amount of things they don't need or need little are forced to be bought or forced to be bought in large quantities. This is where the problem lies.

This matter cannot be blamed solely on the comrades who go to the countryside from the commercial and supply and marketing departments, because this is an arrangement from above. Why is there such an arrangement? Because many comrades in the commercial departments and supply and marketing departments do not understand the needs of the farmers, do not understand the situation of agricultural cooperation, do not conduct investigations and research, and do not solicit the opinions of lower levels. They unilaterally believe that once the rural areas are cooperativized, the farmers will eat sweets, cured meat, and pastries; they will ride bicycles and listen to the radio. Therefore, they send a large number of such goods to the farmers. Yes, the farmers want to eat sweets, cured meat, and pastries, ride bicycles, and listen to the radio. However, this is not the universal and urgent need of the farmers today, and only a minority of farmers need these things today. However, once the goods have been acquired, they must be sold, otherwise a large amount of funds will be tied up, and even a large amount of goods will rot. Therefore, the method of sales on credit was conceived, and forced orders also appeared. This is the inevitable result of replacing policy with impressions.

In any case, forced sales of goods are illegal and must be resolutely prohibited.

Now that sales on credit have finally stopped, the question is how to deal with the aftermath?

Some places have proposed the following methods: 1. For the sweets, pastries, cured meat, etc. that have already been sold on credit, the debts can be repaid gradually within three to five years. If the goods sold on credit have deteriorated, repayment can be waived; 2. For the bicycles, radios, health kits, etc. that have already been sold on credit, those that have been used should be repaid within three to five years, and those that have not been used should be allowed to be returned.

Some people say, what should be done if forced sales on credit happen again in the future? One of the most effective methods is to take the goods and not pay. Only in this way can the commercial departments and supply and marketing departments receive an unforgettable lesson, stop forcing sales on credit, and do a better job by investigating and researching the needs of the masses and respecting the voluntary wishes of buyers.

### 不准强迫推销商品

    不准强迫推销商品
    近来湖北、安徽等省一些地区的商业部门和供销合作部门，强迫农业生产合作社购买或赊购糖果、糕点、腊肉、暖水瓶、收音机、保健箱等等商品。农民不愿意买，说：合作社办起来还不久，我们不打算买这些东西。可是，强迫他们买东西的人说：这是上级的命令啊！你们不买，销售任务怎样完成呢？不能完成销售任务，哪来的资金建设社会主义呢？这样一来，农业合作社为了爱社会主义的国，就只好把货物收下来了。
    农民对这件事情当然很不满意。湖北武汉市郊区前进乡被迫赊购了价值十二万斤稻谷的腊肉，占这个乡全年收入的十分之一。安徽郎溪县幸福农业生产合作社被迫赊购糖果四千八百多斤，折合稻谷七万多斤。农民算算这一笔账，想起稻谷还没有收到手，就欠了这么多的债，不免有些心灰意冷。原来积极生产的不想下田了，有些人办合作社的劲头也不大了。
    商业和供销合作部门的工作同志，辛辛苦苦，带货下乡，为什么吃力反而不讨好呢？道理很简单，就是因为货物不合农民的需要。农业生产合作社刚刚办起来，缺这缺那，本来很希望商业部门和供销合作部门卖给他们一些需要的东西。譬如说：要增加生产，需要一些商品肥料；雨天下田，需要蓑衣斗笠；打了许多井，需要牲口拉水车，等等。可是，现在商业和供销合作部门的工作同志带来的许多货物都不对路。农民需要的东西没有或者很少，不需要的或者需要不多的却来了一大堆；需要的东西买不上，不需要的或者需要不多的硬要买或者硬要多买。这就是问题的所在。
    这件事情不能单纯责备商业和供销合作部门下乡的工作同志，因为这是上级布置的。为什么会有这样的布置呢？因为商业部门和供销合作部门有许多同志不了解农民的需要，不了解农业合作化的情况，不做调查研究，不征求下级的意见，片面地认为农村合作化了，农民就要吃糖果，吃腊肉，吃糕点；就要骑自行车，听收音机了。于是给农民送去大批这类的货物。是的，农民是要吃糖果，吃腊肉，吃糕点，骑自行车，听收音机的。但是，这不是农民今天普遍的迫切需要，农民今天需要这些的究竟还是少数。但是，货物既已办到，就必得卖出，不然就要积压大批资金，甚至烂掉大批货物。于是，赊销的办法就想出来了，强迫命令也出现了。这是用感想代替政策的必然结果。
    无论如何，强迫推销商品是违反法律的，必须坚决禁止。
    现在赊销总算是停下来了，问题是应该怎样善后？
    有的地方提出了这样的办法：一、已经赊销的糖果、糕点、腊肉等，可以在三年到五年内陆续还清欠款，如果赊销的这类货物是已经变质的，可以允许不还款；二、已经赊销的自行车、收音机、保健箱等，动用了的应该在三年到五年内还款，没有动用的应该允许退回。
    有人说，今后如果再发生强迫赊销的事情怎么办呢？一个最有效的办法，就是收下东西不给钱。只有这样，才能使商业部门和供销合作部门得到忘记不了的教训，不再强迫赊销，并且用调查研究群众需要和尊重买主自愿的方法，把工作做的更好。
