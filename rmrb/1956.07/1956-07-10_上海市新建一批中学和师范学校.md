    Shanghai has built sixteen new middle schools, established two new normal colleges and one secondary normal school in the past six months. In the first half of the year, 74 middle schools have implemented the two-part system, and this will increase to more than 160 schools in the second half of the year, accounting for about 80% of all middle schools.
    In order to gradually change the unreasonable distribution of the secondary school network in Shanghai, the distribution of newly built schools this year is based on regional needs, located in Putuo, Zhabei, Dongchang, Changning, Beijiao, Hongkou and other districts, so that students in factory areas and suburbs can apply for enrollment nearby.
    The teaching equipment of some middle schools in Shanghai, especially some private schools taken over this year, is relatively poor. The Shanghai Education Bureau has adopted the method of focusing on equipment, and within the third quarter of this year, it will distribute 36 sets of complete physics, chemistry, and biology experimental instruments, 54 sets of demonstration instruments, 280,000 books, and a considerable number of sports equipment to schools in urgent need.

    上海市新建一批中学和师范学校
    本报讯　上海市半年来已经新建了十六所中学，新办了两所师范学院和一所中等师范学校；上半年已有七十四所中学实施了二部制，下半年将增加到一百六十多校，占全部中学80％左右。
    为了逐步改变上海中等学校网分布不够合理的状况，今年新建学校的分布，是按照地区需要，设置在普陀、闸北、东昌、长宁、北郊、虹口等区，以便工厂区及郊区学生能就近报考入学。
    上海市部分中学，特别是今年新接办的一部分私立学校，教学设备较差。上海市教育局已采取重点装备的办法，在今年第三季度以内分配全套物理、化学、生物实验仪器三十六套，示教仪器五十四套，图书二十八万册及相当数量的体育运动设备给急需的学校。
