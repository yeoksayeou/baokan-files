    Suzhou's Plexiglass
    (By our correspondent) The plexiglass produced by the Anli Chemical Factory in Suzhou has been shipped to the Harbin Electric Meter Instrument Factory and other places such as Beijing, Shanghai, and Shenyang.
    This plexiglass has strong impact resistance, ten times higher than ordinary glass, and is not easily broken under pressure. It has high transparency and provides very clear visibility, making it widely useful in the national defense industry, the electrical appliance industry, and the instrument industry.
