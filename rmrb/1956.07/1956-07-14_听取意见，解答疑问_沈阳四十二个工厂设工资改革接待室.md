Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 11th: Forty-two state-owned factories and enterprises in Shenyang have established wage reform reception rooms to listen to workers' opinions and requests regarding wage reform and to answer various questions they raise.

Some workers in Workshop One of the Shenyang Cigarette Factory reflected that the quality bonus targets were too high. After research by administrative personnel, they concluded that the current impact on product quality was not due to worker operations but rather poor raw materials, and therefore revised the quality bonus targets. After workers in the nailing and sawing group in Workshop Five inquired at the reception room, they clarified that wage standards are assessed based on technical skill and professional competence, further boosting their production enthusiasm. This group was previously unable to complete production tasks evenly, but now they can complete production tasks ahead of schedule every day. Workers in Workshop One also raised opinions on the current phenomenon of unequal pay for equal work. Relevant personnel at the factory are seriously studying these opinions.

    沈阳四十二个工厂设工资改革接待室
    据新华社沈阳11日电　沈阳市有四十二个国营工厂企业设立了工资改革接待室，听取职工们对工资改革的意见和要求，解答他们所提出的各种疑问。
    沈阳卷烟厂一车间有些工人反映质量奖励指标过高，行政人员研究之后，认为当前影响产品质量的不是工人操作上的问题，而是原料不好，便修正了质量奖励指标。五车间钉锯小组工人到接待室询问以后，明确了工资标准是按技术水平和业务能力来评定的，更加鼓舞了他们的生产积极性。这个小组过去不能均衡地完成生产任务，现在每天都能提前完成生产任务。一车间工人还对当前存在的同工不同酬等现象提出意见，工厂的有关人员正在认真地研究这些意见。
