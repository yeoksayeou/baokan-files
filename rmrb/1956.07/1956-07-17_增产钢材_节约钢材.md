Increase Steel Production, Conserve Steel

Dalian Steel Plant Adopts the Most Advanced Oxygen Steelmaking Method

Production Increases by an Average of 20%, Quality is Guaranteed, and Costs are Reduced by 3.59%

All of Dalian Steel Plant's steelmaking furnaces have recently implemented the "oxygen steelmaking method." The "oxygen steelmaking method" is one of the most advanced modern steelmaking technologies. After adopting this new technology, the output of each steelmaking furnace at the Dalian Steel Plant has increased by an average of more than 20%, the quality of the steel has been guaranteed, and non-metallic inclusions and gases in the steel have been reduced. The cost of steelmaking has been reduced by 3.59% compared to the national plan.

Dalian Steel Plant began experimenting with "oxygen steelmaking" in the second quarter of last year. During this year-long experiment, it received enthusiastic assistance from seven scientists from the Institute of Metal Research of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. These scientists specifically helped workers and technicians conduct six "oxygen steelmaking" experiments, solving many technical problems. After each experiment, the scientists took all the experimental data back to the Institute of Metal Research for analysis, and then gave a detailed report of the analysis conclusions to the factory workers, technicians, and management cadres.

In order to train workers to thoroughly master this advanced steelmaking technology during the experiment, the scientists, together with the factory's technical personnel, explained the technical theory and operation methods of oxygen steelmaking to the workers almost every day, either by the steelmaking furnace or in the auditorium, and then organized the workers to discuss. When workers raised difficult questions, they were given specific answers, so that the workers systematically mastered this new technology.

Recently, the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry instructed the factory to compile the experience of implementing "oxygen steelmaking" into a booklet, which will be promoted in the national smelting departments.

Economical Use of Materials

The experience of Jia Bingjun, a worker in the pressing material section of Tianjin Bicycle Factory, who is famous for saving steel, has been widely promoted in his section. In the past six months, this section has saved more than 68 tons of steel, enough to manufacture 2,730 bicycles.

Jia Bingjun's material-cutting experience is mainly based on the size of the material specifications to accurately arrange the cutting plane, even the very few remaining scraps are made into small parts as much as possible.

According to Jia Bingjun's material-cutting experience, with the help of the workshop inspectors, the employees of the pressing material section have thinned and lengthened the steel plates in June according to the specified quality standards, saving more than one ton of steel for six kinds of parts. The section is also preparing to promote this advanced material-cutting experience in the rolling of twenty-five kinds of parts from July to save more steel for the country.

Rimmed Steel Ingots Improve Quality

With the help of Soviet experts, the Central Laboratory of Anshan Iron and Steel Company successfully tested a new method to improve the quality of rimmed steel ingots in mid-July. If Angang Steel applies this new method completely, it can produce tens of thousands of tons of steel for the country every year.

Researchers at the Central Laboratory told Xinhua News Agency reporters that in the past, when Ansteel's rimmed steel ingots were rolled into steel, a long section had to be cut off due to the unqualified quality of the head and tail of the ingots. This time, they learned from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, and added a slag-making agent to the ingot mold when the ingot was poured. The chemical composition of the ingot head was more uniform, reducing the height of the rise. At the same time, they also studied the method of adding an iron cover to the surface of the molten steel immediately after the ingot was poured, so that the molten steel solidified quickly, which made the chemical composition more uniform and improved the mechanical strength of the steel, which could reduce the loss of cutting the head and tail of the steel.

This method, after more than ten days of preliminary testing by the Anshan Steel Plant, proved that every 10,000 tons of rimmed steel ingots can be rolled into 100 tons more steel than in the past.

Reduce Steel Burning Loss Rate

The burning loss rate of various steel materials in the eight joint state-private steel rolling mills under the Tianjin Iron and Steel Industry Company generally decreased in June. Among them, nearly 15 tons of steel ingots were saved only by reducing the burning loss rate of six kinds of steel materials such as eight-millimeter coiled steel.

After the Iron and Steel Industry Company, which leads the eight steel rolling mills, initially completed the joint venture combination of the eight steel rolling mills, it immediately studied the problems existing in these steel rolling mills, such as poor furnace temperature control and imperfect steel rolling equipment. It also held professional meetings to study ways to reduce steel loss and organized veteran technical workers from various factories to study at Tianjin Steel Plant. According to the specific conditions of their factories, they absorbed the advanced experience of Tianjin Steel Plant and improved steel rolling equipment such as the baking furnace, which made production a success.

New Record for Fast Steelmaking

The Li Encai steelmaking team of the state-owned Tianjin Steel Plant completed a furnace of steel in four hours and four minutes on July 15, creating a new record for fast steelmaking in the plant.

After inspecting the shortcomings in steelmaking operations last week, the Li Encai team learned from the steelmaking experience of the plant's advanced team, accelerated the slag-making time in advance, and increased the alkalinity of the slag, so that the heat was accelerated to the molten steel, thereby shortening the smelting time.

    增产钢材  节约钢材
    大连钢厂采用了最先进的氧气炼钢法
    产量平均提高20％，质量有保证，成本降低3.59％
    大连钢厂的全部炼钢炉，最近都实行了“氧气炼钢法”。“氧气炼钢法”是现代最先进的炼钢技术之一。大连钢厂采用这种新技术以后，每座炼钢炉的产量，平均提高了20％以上，钢的质量也有了保证，钢内的非金属夹杂物和气体都减少了；炼钢成本比国家计划降低了3.59％。
    大连钢厂是从去年第二季度开始试验“氧气炼钢”的。在这一年多的试验过程中，曾经得到了中国科学院金属研究所七名科学家的热情帮助。这些科学家具体帮助工人、技术员们正式进行了六次“氧气炼钢”的试验，解决了很多技术问题。每当结束一次试验，科学家们便把所有试验资料带回金属研究所进行分析，最后再把分析的结论，向工厂工人、技术人员、管理干部作详细报告。
    为了训练工人在试验的过程中彻底掌握这种先进的炼钢技术，科学家们同工厂的技术人员，几乎每天都分头在炼钢炉旁或礼堂里，向工人讲解氧气炼钢的技术理论、操作方法等，然后又组织工人讨论；当工人提出疑难问题的时候，再进行具体解答，因而使工人系统地掌握了这一新技术。
    最近，冶金工业部责成这个工厂，把实行“氧气炼钢”的经验编写成小册子，准备在全国冶炼部门推行。
    量材下料
    以节约钢材出名的“巧裁缝”——天津自行车厂压材工段工人贾秉钧的量材下料的经验，已在他所在的工段中普遍推广。这个工段在过去半年内已经节约了足够制造二千七百三十辆自行车使用的六十八吨多钢材。
    贾秉钧的下料经验，主要是根据材料规格的大小，精确地布置剪裁平面，即便是剩下的极少的零碎料也尽可能裁制成小零件。
    压材工段职工根据贾秉钧的下料经验，六月份里在车间检验员的帮助下，已经按照规定的质量标准，将钢板压薄、辗长、使六种零件节省了一吨多钢材。这个工段还准备从七月份起，再在二十五种零件轧制中推广这一先进的下料经验，为国家节约更多的钢材。
    沸腾钢锭提高了质量
    鞍山钢铁公司中央试验室在苏联专家帮助下，七月中旬试验成功一种提高沸腾钢锭质量的新方法。鞍钢炼钢厂如果全部运用这种新的方法，每年就可以为国家多生产好几万吨钢材。
    中央试验室的研究工作者告诉新华社记者说，鞍钢过去所铸的沸腾钢锭在轧制钢材的时候，因为钢锭头部、尾部质量不合格，就要切去很长的一段。这次他们学习了苏联先进经验，在钢锭浇注完毕的时候，向钢锭模内加进一种造渣剂，钢锭头部各种化学成份就比较均匀，减少了上涨高度。同时他们又研究了在钢锭浇注完毕的时候，立即在钢水面上加铁盖的办法，使钢水很快凝固，这样化学成分更为均匀，并且提高了钢材的机械强度，能够减少钢材切头切尾的损失。
    这一方法，经过鞍钢炼钢厂十多天的初步试验证明，每一万吨沸腾钢锭，就能比过去多轧一百吨钢材。
    降低钢材烧损率
    天津市钢铁工业公司所属八个公私合营轧钢厂各种钢材的烧损率在六月份里普遍降低，其中光是八米厘盘条等六种钢材由于降低了烧损率，就节约了近十五吨钢锭。
    领导这八家轧钢厂的钢铁工业公司在八家轧钢厂初步完成了合营的组合以后，就立即研究了这些轧钢厂所存在的炉温控制不好、轧钢机设备不完善等问题。并召开了专业会议，研究降低钢损耗的办法，组织了各厂的老技术工人去天津钢厂学习。他们根据自己工厂的具体条件，吸收了天津钢厂的先进经验，改进了烘钢炉等轧钢设备，使生产获得了成绩。
    快速炼钢新纪录
    国营天津钢厂李恩财炼钢小组，七月十五日用四小时零四分钟炼完了一炉钢，创造了这个厂快速炼钢的新纪录。
    李恩财小组上星期检查了炼钢操作上的缺点以后，学习了本厂先进小组的炼钢经验，提前加速了造渣时间，提高渣子的碱度，使热量加速传到钢水中，因而缩短了冶炼时间。
