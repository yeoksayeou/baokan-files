The Northwest First and Second Engineering Companies of the Ministry of Construction Engineering have consistently had a serious problem with overtime work. The Xi'an Municipal People's Procuratorate investigated this issue, and the People's Daily criticized it on May 27th of this year. Although the phenomenon of overtime work was corrected for a time, it has recently relapsed. From June 1st to June 20th, the First Engineering Area of the First Engineering Company worked a total of more than 3,500 hours of overtime, and most of it was not approved. Workers who worked overtime did not receive overtime pay. Some workers who were unwilling to work overtime were criticized and regarded as backward elements by the leaders. On the evening of June 14th, the third work section of the third engineering area allowed 31 workers to extend their working hours by three hours without approval. When the technical security section of the engineering area intervened, the leading comrades of the work section did not accept it. As a result, three workers were injured that night. One day, the first work section of the second engineering area of the Second Engineering Company, fearing that it would not be able to complete the monthly plan, prepared to work overtime on Sunday. The work section, the engineering area, and the company's trade union all disagreed, but Deputy Director Wang of the engineering area still approved it arbitrarily. The youth shock brigade led by Zhang Jiyao of the first work section worked overtime for three consecutive days and nights. The workers even fell asleep while pulling the carts.

This phenomenon of disregarding workers' health and forcing them to work overtime, and failing to correct it after being criticized, is intolerable. It is recommended that the relevant parties quickly inspect the work of these two engineering companies.

    加班加点的旧病复发
    建筑工程部西北第一、二工程公司加班加点现象一直很严重。这个问题，西安市人民检察院检查过，今年五月二十七日的人民日报也批评过，后来虽然一度纠正过加班加点的现象，但最近又旧病复发了。第一工程公司一工区从六月一日到六月二十日共加班加点三千五百多小时，而且大都没有经过批准；工人加了班也得不到加班费。有的工人不愿加班，就受到批评，被领导上看成落后分子。三工区三工段在六月十四日晚上，没有经过批准，就让三十一名工人延长工作时间三个小时。当工区技术保安科去干涉的时候，工段领导同志还不接受。结果，当晚有三个工人负伤。第二工程公司二工区一工段有一天因为怕完不成月计划，准备在星期日加班，工段、工区、公司工会都不同意，工区王副主任还是独断独行批准下来。一工段张纪尧所领导的青年突击队连续加班加点三天三夜，工人在拉架子车的时候竟打起瞌睡来。
    这种不顾工人健康，强迫工人加班加点，受到批评后仍不改正的现象是不能容忍的，建议有关作。方面迅速检查这两个工程公司的工
