    “Thirty to One”
    Luo Sun
    When the Soviet writer Vera Ketlinskaya visited Shanghai, she talked about her own creative experience at a symposium. She often started writing only after possessing a large amount of life material, and what she wrote in her works only accounted for one-thirtieth of the material she had mastered or was familiar with. That is to say, the ratio of the material she was familiar with to the content she wrote in her works was thirty to one.
    This is very important. Lu Xun repeatedly advised young authors not to forcibly stretch the material of a short story into a long novel.
    From the perspective of scientific research, to understand sparrows, it is enough to dissect just one sparrow. But for literary creation, it is difficult to write about characters if you only understand one person. And the ocean of life is even more vast. Writers should possess or be familiar with as much life material as possible, but it is impossible to write all of them into their works. In some of our works, however, it is often shown that everything the author knows is written into the works, which, in terms of ratio, is one to one. Some are even only one part known, but the writing is forcibly stretched to thirty parts, becoming one to thirty. Some authors may have some perceptual knowledge during "experiencing life," and then collect a large part of written and oral materials, plus a large part of "of course" subjective materials. In this way, one part becomes thirty parts. This is equivalent to wine diluted thirty times with water. The works are full of branches and tendrils that should be cut off, especially those excessive repetitive narratives that make readers feel bored. We can often find some relatively exquisite fragments in certain long novels, but from the perspective of the entire length, it is really terribly loose and protracted. This is precisely because the author did not cut off those "branches and tendrils" that he was not familiar with or should not have written, and let those weeds cover the small flowers that should have had some brilliance.
    A brilliant writer should temper the "thirty parts" of raw life material into "one part" of literary masterpiece, and should not hesitate to abandon those cluttered branches and tendrils.
    Writers often require themselves to reach the "standard" of the "thirty to one" ratio, which is to require themselves to be more broadly and deeply familiar with and understand life.

    “三十比一”
    罗荪
    苏联作家薇拉·凯特玲斯卡娅访问上海的时候，曾经在一个座谈会上谈到她自己的创作经验。她经常是占有了大量的生活材料，才动手创作，而且写在作品里的只占她掌握或者说是她所熟悉的材料的三十分之一，也就是说，她熟悉的材料和她写在作品里的内容的比例是三十比一。
    这是很重要的。鲁迅曾一再劝告青年作者不要把一个短篇的材料硬拉成长篇。
    从科学研究来讲，要了解麻雀，只要解剖一只麻雀就够了。但是文学创作，你只懂得一个人，那是很难写出人物来的。而生活的海洋更是辽阔，作家应该占有或者是熟悉越多越好的生活材料，但它们绝不可能全部写进作品。在我们的有些作品中却常表现出把作者所知道的一切都写在作品里了，用比例数来讲是一比一；有的则竟是知道的不过只有一分，而写出来的却硬拉长为三十分了，就成为了一比三十。有的作者可能在“体验生活”的时候有一点感性知识，又搜集了一大部分文字的和口头的材料，再加上一大部分“想当然耳”的主观材料，就这样，一分变成三十分了。这就等于冲了三十倍水的酒。作品到处都是应该删剪的枝蔓，特别是那些过多的使读者读了发生厌倦的重复的叙述。我们常常可以从某些长篇作品中发现若干比较精致的片段，但从整个篇幅看来，实在是松散拖沓得可怕，这正是由于作者没有把自己并不熟悉的或者是不应该写进去的“枝蔓”割掉，而让那些芜草掩住了原应有些光彩的小花朵。
    一个高明的作家是应该把“三十分”的生活原材料加以千锤百炼，使它成为“一分”文学的精品，而应毫不吝惜地抛弃掉那些芜杂的枝蔓。
    作家经常要求自己达到“三十比一”这个比数的“标准”，正是要求自己应该更宽阔、更深入地熟悉和了解生活。
