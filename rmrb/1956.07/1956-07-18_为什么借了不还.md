    Why Borrow and Not Return?
    At the beginning of this year, in order to solve the problem of idle work on the construction site, we signed a contract with the Sixth Metallurgical Chemical Construction Corporation of the former Ministry of Heavy Industry, temporarily lending them some fitters and welders for their use.
    By the end of May, the borrowing period for the welders had expired, but the Sixth Metallurgical Chemical Construction Corporation still didn't send the workers back. We wrote to them, but they ignored us. We repeatedly urged them by telegram, but the reply we received was: "Due to urgent project needs, the borrowing period is extended by two months." They satisfied their "urgent project needs," but it affected our project progress. Preliminary calculations show that we will create more than 20,000 yuan less in value.
    Conversely, they borrowed our lathe operators and fitters, and the contract stipulated that the term would expire at the end of the year, but they sent back some of them ahead of schedule, causing the workers to be idle here. Since they couldn't use that many workers, or for that long, why didn't they consider it carefully at the beginning?
    I request the leaders of this company to publicly answer this question in the newspaper.	  Yongdeng Cement Plant Third Engineering Department, Ye Jinsheng

    为什么借了不还
    今年年初，为了解决工地上的窝工问题，我们同原重工业部建筑局第六冶金化学建筑总公司签定了合同，把一部分钳工、电焊工暂借给他们使用。
    到五月底，电焊工的借用期已满，第六冶金化学建筑总公司还不把工人送回来，我们写信去，他们不理，一再用电报去催，得到的回答却是：“因工程急需，延长借期两个月。”他们满足了“工程急需”，我们可影响了工程进度，初步计算要少创造两万元以上的价值。
    相反的，他们借用我们的车工、钳工，合同规定到年底满期，他们却提前送回来一部分，使得工人在我们这里窝工。既然他们用不了那么多工人，或者用不了那么长的时间，为什么当初不考虑好呢？
    我要求这个公司的领导人员在报上公开答复这问题。	  永登水泥厂第三工程处　叶金声
