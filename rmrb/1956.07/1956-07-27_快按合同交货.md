Expedite Delivery According to Contract

On February 29th of this year, our bureau signed a second-quarter timber supply contract with the Northeast Timber Industry Administration's Dailing Lumber Mill. After the contract was signed, we sent people to the Dailing Lumber Mill to urge delivery, and they readily agreed: they would definitely ship on time. However, as of July 8th, of the 170 cubic meters of timber originally scheduled to be shipped to Zhumadian in April, 140 cubic meters were still missing. The 30 cubic meters that should have been shipped to Zhengzhou in May had not arrived at all. The 150 cubic meters scheduled to be shipped to Xinyang in June had also not arrived. More than 30 cubic meters of finished timber that should have been sent to Xuchang in the first and second quarters are still outstanding.

The Dailing Lumber Mill failed to deliver according to the contract and did not notify us in advance. In May, we sent several official letters and telegrams to urge them, but they ignored us. We also repeatedly reported this situation to the mill's superior authority, the Northeast Timber Industry Administration, but still received no response. It was not until June, when our bureau stated that if they failed to deliver according to the contract, the other party would be responsible for all consequences, that they gave us a notice requesting to change the timber specifications or return the goods.

Because this mill failed to deliver according to our contract, it has affected our project progress and caused considerable losses. We demand that this mill strictly investigate responsibility and quickly improve its work.

    快按合同交货
    今年二月二十九日，我们局同东北制材工业管理局带岭制材厂签订了第二季度木材供货合同。合同签订之后，我们就派人到带岭制材厂去催货，他们满口答应：一定按期发运。可是直到七月八日，原订四月份发到驻马店的一百七十立方公尺木材，还差一百四十立方公尺。应该在五月份发到郑州的三十立方公尺，始终没有运来。订在六月份发到信阳的一百五十立方公尺，也没有运到。第一、二季度应该发给许昌的成材，至今还有三十多立方公尺没有给够。
    带岭制材厂不按合同交货，事先也没有通知我们。五月份我们曾数次去公函、发电报催问，他们理也不理。我们也曾数次把这个情况反映给这个厂的上级机关——东北制材工业管理局，依然是毫无音信。直到六月份我局提出如果不按合同交货，一切后果由对方负责任的时候，他们才给了一个要求变更木材规格或者退货的通知。
    由于这个厂没能按我们的合同交货，影响了我们的工程进度，造成了相当大的损失。我们要求这个厂严格检查责任，迅速改进工作。
