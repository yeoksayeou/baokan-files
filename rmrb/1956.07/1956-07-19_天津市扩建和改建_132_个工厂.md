Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, July 18th: Xinhua News Agency reporter Fang Ling reports: Tianjin, one of China's largest coastal industrial bases, has 132 local state-owned and joint state-private factories undergoing expansion and reconstruction. After the completion of the expansion and reconstruction projects, the output of each factory will increase by a factor of two to six.

    The 132 factories have relatively large potential in their existing equipment, good technical conditions, and sell their products well. Therefore, a relatively large benefit can be obtained by investing a small amount of capital, adding some equipment and buildings. After the thirty-four factories expanded and reconstructed by the Tianjin Municipal Heavy Industry Bureau are put into production, the annual increase in output value, calculated on sixteen products, is equivalent to more than fourteen times the total investment in the expansion and reconstruction project; the annual output value of seven new products alone can exceed the total investment by nearly two times. The local state-owned Tianjin Machine Tool Factory, which could only produce boilers and some machine parts in the past, can become a veritable machine tool manufacturer producing Soviet 1615M type lathes after expansion. The investment and time required to expand this factory is only one-third of the investment and time required to build a new machine tool factory of the same size. Moreover, after the factory is put into production, the investment can be recovered from profits in less than a year.

    In the past year, these factories under expansion and reconstruction have successfully trial-produced more than two hundred new products. These new products can be put into production successively after the completion of the expansion and reconstruction of the factories. The joint state-private Qixing Photographic Equipment Factory, which could only manufacture dry plates in the past, will be able to produce ordinary photographic film, movie film, and X-ray photographic plates, which are currently still imported from foreign countries, in large quantities next year after expansion.

    Among this group of factories being expanded and reconstructed, about half are heavy industry and electromechanical industry factories that are closely related to supporting the construction of the interior. The products produced by these factories include hundreds of types such as cranes, drilling machines, electric wires, high-quality steel, and trisodium phosphate for cleaning boiler scale in railway locomotives. After the completion of the seven machine, riveting, and forging factories that the Electromechanical Bureau focuses on expanding this year, the output will be increased by more than two times.

    There are also some factories being expanded and reconstructed that serve the people's livelihood. For example, the local state-owned First Printing and Dyeing Factory, which produces printed cloth, will be able to increase the production of 225,000 meters of high-grade printed cloth in just two months by the end of the year after the expansion is completed in October. After the expansion of the famous joint state-private Renli Woolen Mill, it will supply people with more high-quality clothing materials such as palissy and wool serge. After the reconstruction of the Feima brand thermos bottle factory—the joint state-private Shengsheng Thermos Bottle Factory—the annual output of thermos bottles will increase from 700,000 to 1 million.

    天津市扩建和改建132个工厂
    新华社天津18日电　新华社记者方凌报道：我国最大的沿海工业基地之一——天津市，有132个地方国营和公私合营工厂正在扩建和改建。这些工厂的扩建和改建工程完成以后，各厂产量将要分别提高一倍到六倍。
    这132个工厂现有设备的潜力都比较大，技术条件也比较好，产品畅销，所以在投入少量资金、增加一些设备和厂房之后，就可以获得比较大的效益。天津市重工业局扩建和改建的三十四个工厂投入生产之后，按十六种产品计算，一年所增加的产值，就相当于扩建改建工程投资总数的十四倍以上；其中七种新产品一年的产值，就能超过投资总数近两倍。过去只能生产锅炉和一些机器配件的地方国营天津机床厂经过扩建以后，就可以成为生产苏联1615M型车床的名符其实的机床制造厂。扩建这个工厂的投资和时间，只相当于新建一个同等规模的机床厂所需要的投资和时间的三分之一。并且，在工厂投入生产以后，用不了一年的时间，就可以把投资额从利润中收回。
    正在扩建和改建的这些工厂，在过去一年中曾经试制成功了二百多种新产品。这些新产品在工厂扩建和改建完工以后，就可以陆续投入生产。过去只能制造干版的公私合营七星摄影器材厂扩建以后，明年就可以大量生产目前还靠外国进口的普通摄影软片、电影软片和“爱克斯”光照相底版等。
    在这批扩建和改建的工厂当中，约有一半是和支援内地建设有密切关系的重工业和机电工业的工厂。这些工厂所生产的产品有起重机、钻探机、电线、优质钢和供清洗铁路机车锅炉水锈用的磷酸三钠等上百种。机电局今年重点扩建的机器、铆造、锻压等七个工厂完工以后，产量都将提高两倍以上。
    还有些扩建和改建的工厂，是为人民生活服务的。如生产花布的地方国营第一印染厂，在十月份扩建完工之后，到年底仅两个月就能增产二十二万五千公尺高级花布。著名的公私合营仁立毛织厂扩建以后，将供给人们更多的派力司、毛哔叽等优质衣料。销路很广的飞马牌热水瓶制造厂——公私合营生生热水瓶厂改建以后，热水瓶的年产量将由七十万只提高到一百万只。
