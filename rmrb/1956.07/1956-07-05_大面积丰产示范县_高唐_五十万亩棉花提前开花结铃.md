Xinhua News Agency, Liaocheng, 4th: In Gaotang County, Shandong Province, one of the large-scale high-yield cotton demonstration counties, nearly 500,000 mu of cotton have generally blossomed and formed bolls more than ten days earlier than usual. In the areas of Jiucheng, Liangcun, and Liulisi in this county, cotton has grown to one and a half chi (approximately 1.6 feet) tall and has six or seven cotton bolls. In the Chengguan and Yinji areas, the cotton that suffered from insect pests in the early stage has also generally blossomed and budded after vigorous rescue efforts.

This year, the 116 advanced agricultural production cooperatives in Gaotang County universally promoted the experience of large-scale high-yield cotton from Xinjiang in the early management of cotton. In order to promote the growth of cotton seedlings, each cooperative grasped the opportunity to weed twice before the wheat harvest, based on Xinjiang's experience of early weeding and early thinning. Hongwei, Qunli, Luwei, Xinghuo and other agricultural production cooperatives used rulers to measure during cotton seedling setting, correctly retaining seedlings according to the prescribed number of plants, achieving equal spacing and uniformity, with a density of more than 6,000 plants per mu. In the past, cotton farmers in Gaotang County were accustomed to applying fertilizer by scattering it, resulting in a lot of fertilizer efficiency being lost after rain. This year, agricultural production cooperatives adopted the method of early topdressing and ditch topdressing according to Xinjiang's experience, giving full play to the effectiveness of the fertilizer. Cotton field management such as insect removal and "trouser leg removal" (removing lower leaves) in the agricultural production cooperatives was also more timely and meticulous than in previous years.

At present, nearly 500,000 mu of cotton in Gaotang County has generally been hoed three to four times, and more than 90% has been topdressed with the first application of fertilizer. In order to promote the early maturity of cotton bolls and prevent cotton boll shedding, agricultural production cooperatives are continuing to carry out cotton field intertillage, topdressing, and prevention and control of cotton boll stage insect pests.

### 大面积丰产示范县—高唐  五十万亩棉花提前开花结铃

    大面积丰产示范县—高唐
    五十万亩棉花提前开花结铃
    新华社聊城4日电　棉花大面积丰产示范县之一的山东省高唐县，近五十万亩棉花普遍提前十多天开花结铃。这个县的旧城、梁村、琉璃寺等区的棉花已长到一尺半高，结有六七个棉铃。城关、尹集等区前期遭受虫害的棉花，经过大力抢救也普遍开花现蕾。
    今年，高唐县的116个高级农业生产合作社，在棉花的初期管理中普遍推广了新疆棉花大面积丰产的经验。各社为促进棉花幼苗生长，根据新疆早锄草、早间苗的经验，在收麦前就抓紧锄过两遍。宏伟、群力、鲁伟、星火等农业生产合作社，在棉花定苗时用尺子量，按照规定的株数正确留苗，做到等距均匀，每亩密植达六千多株。往年高唐县的棉农习惯用撒的办法追施肥料，经雨后肥效流失很多，今年各农业生产合作社按照新疆的经验采用早追肥和开沟追肥的办法，发挥了肥料的效能。各农业生产合作社的棉花除虫、脱裤腿等棉田管理，也都比往年做的及时和细致。
    现在，高唐县的近五十万亩棉花已普遍锄过三遍到四遍，并有90％以上追施了第一遍肥料。各农业生产合作社为促使棉铃早熟，防止棉铃脱落，正继续进行棉田中耕、追肥和防治棉花铃期虫害。
