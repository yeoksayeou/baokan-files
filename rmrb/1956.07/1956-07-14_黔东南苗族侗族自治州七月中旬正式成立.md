Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang, July 13th: Preparations for the Southeastern Guizhou Miao and Dong Autonomous Prefecture in Guizhou Province have essentially concluded. At the second meeting of the Autonomous Prefecture Preparatory Work Committee, held in early July, the twenty-seven committee members carefully summarized the preparatory work of the past two months and decided to convene the first session of the first People's Congress of the prefecture on July 15th to formally establish the Southeastern Guizhou Miao and Dong Autonomous Prefecture.

During the period of preparing for the establishment of the Southeastern Guizhou Miao and Dong Autonomous Prefecture, the political enthusiasm of the people of all ethnic groups has been unprecedentedly high due to the extensive publicity of the Party's ethnic policies. By the end of June, in addition to actively completing agricultural and sideline production according to plan to welcome the establishment of the autonomous prefecture, the people of the sixteen counties in the area had also conscientiously elected two hundred and sixty-five representatives to the People's Congress of the prefecture. The representatives include Miao, Dong, Han, Buyi, and other ethnic groups. Based on the demands of the people of all ethnic groups, they will put forward more than one hundred proposals on developing the politics, economy, and culture of the ethnic minorities. Some counties have also held symposiums of ethnic minority representatives to further collect opinions and problems in the implementation of ethnic policies, which will also be submitted to the People's Congress of the prefecture for review and discussion.

    黔东南苗族侗族自治州七月中旬正式成立
    新华社贵阳13日电　贵州省黔东南苗族侗族自治州筹备工作已基本结束。在七月上旬召开的自治州筹备工作委员会第二次会议上，二十七位委员认真总结了两个月来的筹备工作情况，并决定在七月十五日召开州第一届人民代表大会第一次会议，正式成立黔东南苗族侗族自治州。
    在筹建黔东南苗族侗族自治州期中，由于深入宣传了党的民族政策，各族人民的政治热情空前高涨。到六月底止，这个地区十六个县的人民除积极按计划完成农业副业生产，以迎接自治州的建立外，并认真选出二百六十五名州人民代表大会代表。代表们包括苗、侗、汉、布依等民族，他们根据各族人民的要求，将提出一百多件关于发展少数民族政治、经济和文化等方面的提案。有的县还召开了少数民族代表座谈会，进一步搜集对执行民族政策中的意见和问题，也将提交州人民代表大会审查和讨论。
