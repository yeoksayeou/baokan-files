Xinhua News Agency dispatch: Wang Jiaping, director of the Electronic Physics Teaching and Research Group of the Physics Department of Nankai University, recently successfully trial-produced two sets of electronic instruments for measuring cosmic rays: a "Ten-Channel Differential Discriminator" and a "Cosmic Ray Analyzer." These two sets of instruments have a total of more than 370 electronic tubes. The "Cosmic Ray Analyzer" includes "coincidence," "anti-coincidence," and "delayed coincidence" components, and can distinguish cosmic ray particles within one millionth of a second to one ten-millionth of a second.

This type of electronic instrument has a wide range of applications. It is not only suitable for measuring cosmic rays using various counting tubes, but also for measuring the radiation emitted by radioactive isotopes. At the same time, it is also an important research equipment for the peaceful application of atomic energy. Wang Jiaping successfully trial-produced the instrument after more than a year of research. He is now using this instrument to carry out his scientific research work in the field of "cosmic rays."

    两套测量宇宙射线的电子仪器制成
    新华社讯　南开大学物理系电子物理教研组主任汪佳平，最近试制成功两套测量宇宙射线的电子仪器——“十路微分甄别器”和“宇宙射线分析器”。这两套仪器共有三百七十多支电子管。“宇宙射线分析器”包括有“符合”、“舛符合”和“推迟符合”三部分，能在一百万分之一秒到一千万分之一秒内分辨出宇宙射线的粒子。
    这种电子仪器的用途很广，它不但适合应用各种计数管来测量宇宙射线，而且对放射性同位素所放出的辐射射线也可以测量：同时它也是原子能和平应用方面的重要研究设备。汪佳平经过了一年多的研究，才试制成功。现在，他正利用这种仪器进行他的“宇宙射线”方面的科学研究工作。
