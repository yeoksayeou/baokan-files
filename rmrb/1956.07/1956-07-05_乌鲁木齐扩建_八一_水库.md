Urumqi Expands "August 1st" Reservoir

(Our dispatch) The "August 1st" Reservoir, which is being expanded by the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps in the Urumqi reclamation area, began full-scale construction in mid-June. This reservoir is a water conservancy project in the same irrigation area as the Mengjin Reservoir, which was recently completed. Its original storage capacity was only 8 million cubic meters. After the expansion, the storage capacity will reach 25 million to 30 million cubic meters, which can irrigate more than 60,000 mu of farmland.
