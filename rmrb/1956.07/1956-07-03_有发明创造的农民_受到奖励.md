    Rewarding Peasants with Inventions and Innovations

    (Our report) The Nanchong Special District of Sichuan Province held an agricultural tool reform conference in early June. The conference assessed the agricultural tools, hand tools, and their blueprints created, modified, and imitated by the people of various counties (cities) under its jurisdiction. Finally, it was determined that 19 agricultural tools and 10 hand tools could be promoted. Among them, the trial-produced sprinkler, two-way hoe, cotton square seedling grid marker, mulberry cutting machine, bamboo cylinder waterwheel, and the imitation sprayer, transplanter, double-wheeled double-share modified wooden wheel, circular weeding tool, etc., have very good efficiency and low cost. For example, the circular weeding tool successfully imitated by Luo Shaozhou, a member of the Caishan Township Iron Industry Cooperative in Wusheng County, costs only 7 jiao and 2 fen each, and improves efficiency by 150% compared to manual weeding. The mulberry cutting machine created by He Quanke, a member of the Chengguan Iron Industry Cooperative in Xichong County, improves efficiency by ten times compared to manual labor, and can also cut grass and pig feed. The improved bamboo cylinder waterwheel created by Cai Chaolian, a farmer in the Central Second Village of Erlong Township in Langzhong County, improves efficiency by three times compared to the old-fashioned waterwheel, while the cost is 75% lower than the old-fashioned waterwheel.

    The conference awarded material rewards and certificates to these farmers and craftsmen according to the value of their creations and inventions.

    有发明创造的农民
    受到奖励
    本报讯　四川省南充专区在六月初召开的农具改革会议，对所属各县（市）群众创造、改制、仿制的农具，手工工具及其图纸进行了鉴定，最后确定可以推广的农具有十九件，手工工具十件。其中试制成的洒水机，两用锄、棉花方格育苗划格器、切桑机、竹筒水车以及仿造的喷雾器、移苗器、双轮双铧改木轮、圆圈薅秧器等效率很好，成本也低。例如武胜县采善乡铁业社社员罗绍州仿制成功的圆圈薅秧器，每个成本七角二分，比人力薅秧提高效率150％；西充县城关铁业社社员何全科创造的切桑机，比人力提高效率十倍，并且还能切草和猪饲料。阆中县二龙乡中心二村农民蔡朝连创造的改良竹筒水车，比旧式水车提高效率三倍，而成本比旧式水车低75％。
    会议根据这些农民和工匠创造发明价值的大小，分别给他们发了物质奖励和奖状。
