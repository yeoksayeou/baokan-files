    The main U.S. base in Spain will be Rota, near Cadiz on the Atlantic coast. It will be specifically for the use of the largest U.S. aircraft carriers.

    Morón, about thirty miles southeast of Seville, is the second most important U.S. base in Spain in terms of importance. This base is for strategic bombers. The third important base is being built at San Pablo, near Seville. One of the largest military bases is planned to be built in Torrejón, twelve miles from Madrid, and the headquarters of the entire U.S. base network in Spain will be located here.

    In addition, the U.S. is building naval and air force bases in many other locations. The U.S. has also begun military construction in the Balearic Islands, mainly on the islands of Mallorca and Menorca.
