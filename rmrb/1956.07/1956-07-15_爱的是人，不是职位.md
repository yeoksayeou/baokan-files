	“It’s the Person I Love, Not the Position”

	I
	One early spring Saturday evening, the weather was still a bit chilly. The entrance and lobby of the Nanchang City Cultural Education Cinema were packed with people waiting to see the second showing of the film; the movie poster displayed "The Fairy Couple" in extra-large characters. A young woman in a purple-red short coat was squeezing through the crowd, as if searching for someone.

	Just then, a young man in a navy blue Zhongshan suit walked up to the ticket window to buy a ticket. The young woman immediately approached him with delight, and said very politely and solemnly:

	"Comrade, please buy a ticket for me."

	The young man repeatedly said, "Okay."

	After the tickets were bought, the two of them walked into the cinema together. They commented as they watched. At this time, although it was impossible to see the expressions on their faces clearly, it could be heard from their soft conversations that they were deeply moved by the story in the film. When the scene of "Separation at Huaiyin" appeared on the screen, the man sighed involuntarily, and the woman followed with a long breath. It turned out that she had connected her own feelings with the man's, and also connected her conditions for finding a lover with his appearance.

	Her criteria for choosing a lover were: first, to be both senior in terms of experience and young in age; second, to be both handsome and experienced; third, to be both serious and passionate; fourth, to be both lively and steady; fifth, to have both proletarian thoughts and the demeanor of the petty bourgeoisie.

	These conditions and the impression he gave her were constantly churning in her mind. Finally, she came to a very satisfactory conclusion: judging from his clothes, his position was either a division chief or a section chief. As for his character? He could be described as a rare handsome man in China. As for his age? At most only thirty, seven years older than herself, which was not too old. As for his demeanor, although his petty-bourgeois style was not yet fully formed, he was not countrified... She was truly a bit ecstatic!

	Perhaps she was infected by the enthusiastic and unrestrained pursuit of love by the Seventh Fairy, or perhaps she was excited by the very satisfactory conclusion she had drawn for herself. When the word "The End" appeared on the screen, she asked him in a very charming manner:

	"Where are you going?"

	"I'm going to the department store to buy something."

	"I'm also going to the department store to buy something, let's walk together!"

	This young couple strolled and talked. From the tragic encounter of the Seventh Fairy and Dong Yong, they talked about the happy men and women of today… The more they talked, the more speculative they became. At this time, the woman admired the man immensely. She decided not to let go of this unexpected "catch," and therefore, at the time of parting, she boldly proposed to him the appointment of watching a movie next Saturday evening, the man though feeling a little bit sudden, but examined the woman, and agreed.

	II

	Seven days passed in a flash. Today she dressed up even more beautifully. Two hours before the appointed time, she arrived at the meeting place to wait for him. Time passed minute by minute. The appointed time had passed for more than an hour, and his shadow was still not seen. She was getting anxious and couldn't help but resent herself for being so careless that day, not asking for his name and address. However, she was, after all, a woman with a "strong" will. She showed the patience that had never appeared in her work and waited tenaciously. Finally, her wish came true. Three hours later, he arrived at the appointed place.

	She learned from the previous lesson and quickly introduced her name as soon as they met, and asked for his name. She learned that his surname was Chen and his name was Jimin, and he also knew that she was Fu Shui'e. As they were exchanging courtesies, someone came from behind, called Chen Jimin over, handed him a letter, and said a few words to him in a low voice. Although Fu Shui'e did not hear clearly what they said, she had already clearly seen the four big characters "Chief Chen" on the envelope with her special agility and wit. It seemed that Chen Jimin was a senior cadre, which was absolutely true. Encouraged by a strong possessive desire, Fu Shui'e boldly made the request to Chen Jimin to "make friends."

	Chen Jimin was truly "flattered and alarmed" to see Fu Shui'e's such a clear and bold expression. He thought about what kind of person he was, how could he fall in love with a nurse? But the image of the Seventh Fairy and Dong Yong in the film reappeared in his mind: Dong Yong was still loved warmly by the Seventh Fairy even when he was sold into slavery. Since the Seventh Fairy could love Dong Yong, why couldn't Fu Shui'e love Chen Jimin? …

	Just as he was in a dilemma, Fu Shui'e's mind was also working intensely. She considered Chen Jimin's situation, which was exactly the opposite of what Chen Jimin was considering himself. Fu Shui'e believed that Chen Jimin was a senior cadre. With him, she would have a reliable life-long support, and she could transfer to a more leisurely job and not have to deal with patients every day...

	After a brief silence, Chen Jimin carefully gave the following answer to her request to "make friends": "My education level is very low, I am not qualified to be friends with you."

	"What are you talking about." She denied Chen Jimin's words without thinking.

	Then, the two had the following conversation:

	"My position is very low."

	"I like you no matter how low your position is."

	"What if I am a clerk?"

	"I just like you as this clerk!" And added: "It's the person I love, not the position!"

	Chen Jimin thought she really fell in love with him after hearing Fu Shui'e's frank answer.

	III

	The date of marriage registration was decided.

	After eagerly waiting, the day of marriage registration finally arrived. Fu Shui'e put on a new set of woolen clothes and went excitedly to the mail room of Chen Jimin's organization.

	"Looking for Chief Chen."

	"Looking for which Chief Chen?" the mail room staff asked.

	"Looking for Chen Jimin!"

	"Chen Jimin is not a chief, he is a clerk."

	"Don't joke, that's impossible, he is my lover, how could I not know!"

	"Not joking, Chen Jimin is indeed a clerk."

	"You can get him for me."

	"Is Chen Jimin here? … Not here. What? Went to get hot water...When he's back from getting hot water, ask him to come to the mail room, someone is looking for him."

	These words made Fu Shui'e's fiery heart half cold. Disappointed, she looked inside the organization, and sure enough, she saw Chen Jimin carrying a thermos in one hand... Unable to say whether it was anger or regret, her purple-red face suddenly turned as white as paper. She picked up a pen and wrote the following note:

	"I thought you were a chief, but in fact, you are a clerk, you lied to me, we will break up from now on, you are not qualified to be my lover... Fu Shui'e"

	After writing, she ran away without looking back.

	Although she was gone, the words "It's the person I love, not the position" which once gave people a lofty feeling, lingered in Chen Jimin's mind for a long time...

    “爱的是人，不是职位”
    李力今	一
    一个初春的星期六的晚上，天气还有些寒意，南昌市文教电影院的门前和休息室里，挤满了等待看第二场电影的人群；电影广告牌上，用特大的字标明今天上演“天仙配”。一个身穿紫红色短大衣的女青年，在人丛中挤来挤去，好像在寻找什么人似的。
    正在这时，一个身着藏青色呢子中山装的男青年走到售票窗口买票，这个女青年立刻喜出望外地走近那个男青年，很有礼貌也很庄重地说：
    “同志，请你代我买一张票。”
    男青年接连说“好”。
    票买好了以后，两个人就相跟着走进电影院。两个人边看边评论。在这时，虽然看不清两个人面部的表情，但从两个人轻声细语的交谈中，可以听出他们已被电影中的故事深深感动了。当“槐荫分别”的镜头在银幕上出现的时候，男的不由自主地长叹了一声，女的也跟着出了一口长气。原来她把自己的感情和男方的感情联系起来了，也把自己寻找爱人的条件和对方的表象联系起来了。
    她选爱人的标准是：第一是既资格老又年纪青；第二是既漂亮又老诚；第三是既严肃又多情；第四是既活泼又稳重；第五是既有无产阶级的思想又有小资产阶级的风度。
    这几个条件和对方给她的印象，在她的脑海里不断翻腾，最后她得出了一个十分满意的结论：从他的衣着上看，他的职位不是处长就是科长。论人品吗？可称得起中国稀有的美男子。论年纪吗？至多只有三十，比自己大七岁，也不算大。论风度么，虽然小资产阶级风度还不十足，但还不土里土气……。她真是有些飘飘欲仙了！
    不知是被七仙女的热烈的、奔放的追求爱情的方式所感染，还是为她自己所作的那个十分美满的结论所激动，当银幕上出现“完”字的时候，她以一种非常妩媚的姿态问他：
    “你到哪里去！”
    “我到百货公司去买一点东西。”
    我也到百货公司买一点东西，我们一同走吧！”
    这一对青年男女一边散着步一边谈着天。从七仙女和董永的悲惨遭遇谈到了今天的幸福男女……两个人越谈越投机，这时，女的对男的佩服得五体投地。她决定绝不放松这个意外的“猎获物”，因此，在告别的时候，她大胆地提出了下星期六晚上请他看电影的约会，男的虽然觉得有些突然，但端详了一下女方，也就答应下来了。	二
    七天的时间一晃就过去了，今天她打扮得更加漂亮，还在约会时间的两个钟头以前，就到了约会的地点等待着他。时间一分一秒地过去，约会的时间已经过了一个多钟头，怎么还不见他的影子呢？她有些发急了，不禁有些怨恨自己那天为什么那样粗心，没有问清他的姓名和地址。但是，她毕竟是一个有着“坚强”意志的女性，她拿出了在工作上从来没有出现过的耐性，顽强地等待起来。终于，天从人愿，三个钟头以后他来到了约会的地方。
    她接受了上次的教训，一见面赶紧介绍了自己的姓名，并询问了他的姓名，她知道他姓陈名叫季民，他也知道她是傅水娥。正在他们互通款曲的时候，从后边赶来一个人，把陈季民叫过去，交给他一封信，还轻声地和他说了几句话。傅水娥虽然没听清楚他们说的是什么话，但以她特有的敏捷和机伶，已经把信封上的陈处长收的四个大字看得清清楚楚了。看来陈季民是一个大干部，是千真万确的了。被一种强烈的占有欲怂恿着，傅水娥大胆地向陈季民提出了“交朋友”的要求。
    陈季民看见傅水娥这样明确大胆的表示，真是“受宠若惊”，想想自己是一个什么样的人，怎么能够和一个护士小姐谈恋爱呢？但是电影镜头里七仙女和董永的形象又重现在他的脑海：董永在卖身为奴的情况下，七仙女还热烈地爱他。既然七仙女能够爱董永，傅水娥为什么不能爱我陈季民？……
    正当他在左右为难的时候，傅水娥的脑海也在紧张地活动，她考虑陈季民的情况，和陈季民自己所考虑的恰恰相反。傅水娥认为陈季民是一个大干部，有了他，终身生活就有了依靠，可以调换一个比较轻闲的工作，不必天天和病人打交道了……。
    经过了一个短暂的沉默以后，陈季民对她的“交朋友”的要求小心翼翼地作了这样的回答：“我的文化程度很低，和你交朋友不够条件。”
    “哪里的话。”她根本不加考虑就否定了陈季民的话。
    接着，两人作了如下的谈话：
    “我职位很低。”
    “你职位再低我也喜欢你。”
    “如果我是公务员呢？”
    “我就喜欢你这个公务员！”并且补充了一句：“爱的是人，不是职位！”
    陈季民听了傅水娥爽朗的回答，以为她真的爱上了他。	三
    结婚登记的日期决定了。
    好容易盼呀盼的盼到了结婚登记的这一天，傅水娥穿上了新做的一套毛料衣裙，兴冲冲地到了陈季民所在的机关的收发室。
    “找陈处长。”
    “找哪个陈处长？”收发室工作人员问。
    “找陈季民！”
    “陈季民不是处长，是公务员。”
    “不要开玩笑，这是不可能的，他是我的爱人，我还不知道！”
    “不是开玩笑，陈季民的确是公务员。”
    “你给我找来好了。”
    “陈季民在吗？……不在。什么？打开水去了……他打开水回来，叫他到收发室来，有人找他。”
    这几句话，使傅水娥火热的心凉了半截。她失意地向机关的内部望去，果然看见陈季民一只手提着一只热水瓶……。说不上是气愤，还是懊悔，紫红的面孔顿时变得像一张白纸。她提起笔写了如下的一个条子：
    “我以为你是处长，而实际你是一个公务员，你骗了我，我们从此一刀两断，你没有资格作我的爱人……傅水娥”
    写完，便头也不回地跑开了。
    人虽然走了，但“爱的是人，不是职位”这句曾经给人以崇高的感情的话，却久久萦回在陈季民的脑海中……。
