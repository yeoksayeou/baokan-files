Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, July 7th: An official statement was released by the Indian Information Bureau yesterday stating that the Indian Air Force had completely taken over the airport on the island of Car Nicobar on July 1st.

Indian Prime Minister Nehru stated in the People's Assembly last May that the British Air Force's use of the Car Nicobar Island airport was conditional, and that condition was that India had the right to reclaim the airport at any time.

The "Hindustan Standard" commented on this matter on July 6th, stating, "India believes that because it has always firmly opposed colonialism, it cannot allow Britain to retain the right to use this airport, because this airport will soon develop into a stronghold of British colonial rule in Southeast Asia."

Car Nicobar Island is located in the middle of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands in the Indian Ocean. Since India's independence, this airport has been an important stronghold on the British Air Force's route to Southeast Asia. Indian newspapers pointed out that in recent years, with the strengthening of British military operations in its Southeast Asian colonies, especially in Malaya, this airport has become extremely important.

    印度接管英国在印一机场
    新华社新德里7日电　印度新闻局昨天发表公报说，印度空军已经在七月一日全部接管了卡尔尼科巴岛的机场。
    印度总理尼赫鲁去年五月在人民院说过，当初让英国空军使用卡尔尼科巴岛机场是有条件的，这个条件就是印度有权随时收回这个机场。
    七月六日的“印度斯坦旗报”就这件事发表评论说，“印度认为，由于它一向坚决反对殖民主义，它不能够让英国保留对这个机场的使用权，因为这个机场不久一定会发展成为英国在东南亚的殖民统治的堡垒”。
    卡尔尼科巴岛位于印度洋中安达曼群岛和尼科巴群岛的当中。自从印度独立以来，这个机场一直是英国空军通到东南亚的航线上的一个重要据点。印度报纸指出：在最近几年，随着英国在它的东南亚殖民地，特别是在马来亚的军事行动的加强，这个机场变得极为重要了。
