    新华社6日讯　全国人民代表大会民族委员会已经开始或正在准备按地区分八个组对全国大部分少数民族作为期四年到七年的全面的社会历史情况调查。这是新华社记者从五日闭幕的第三次民族委员会全体会议上获悉的。
    四川和云南两个调查组的一部分调查工作人员已经在今年五月份出发到当地工作。这两个组的调查重点是四川的彝、藏、羌族和云南的景颇、佧瓦、傈僳、怒、崩龙、独龙和苦聪族。其他西北地区，贵州省和湖南省，西藏地区，广西省和广东省，内蒙古和东北地区等六个调查组，也大部将在这个月内出发。
    会议宣布，通过这次调查将要弄清楚中国各主要民族目前的社会经济结构、阶级情况以及各民族特殊的风俗习惯，其目的一方面是为了更好地做好今后的民族工作，同时将为研究中国各民族历史和人类自原始公社以来的古代史提供丰富具体的资料。
    参加这次调查的除民族委员会的干部外，还将有中国科学院、中央民族学院、北京和各地的一些大学的专家，教授和大学生，以及懂得少数民族文学、绘画、音乐等的文化艺术专门人员。中央民族学院副院长费孝通，民族学院研究部主任翁独健、副主任夏康农等有名的民族学和历史学专家，也将参加这次调查工作。调查工作人员将达二百人。
    各调查组出发调查时都将配备电影机、录音机、照相机等各种设备，以便对各种宝贵资料进行实地纪录。
    会议指出，这次大规模的长期调查是我国民族工作和科学研究工作的创举，意义是重大的。
