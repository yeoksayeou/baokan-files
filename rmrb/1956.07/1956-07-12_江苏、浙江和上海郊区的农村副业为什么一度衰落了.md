    Why Did Rural Sideline Occupations in the Suburbs of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Shanghai Once Decline?
    Ji Nong
    The rural areas in the suburbs of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Shanghai not only have developed agriculture but also rich and diverse sideline occupations. Farmers engage in many types of sideline occupations. For example, in the Suzhou area alone, farmers engage in six major categories of sideline occupations, including breeding, handicrafts, agricultural product processing, and transportation, totaling more than 200 types. In 1955, the total output value of only 27 sideline productions such as pig breeding, fish farming, silkworm rearing, weaving, embroidery, lace making, and winemaking reached 145.512 million yuan, accounting for 23.08% of the total output value of agriculture and sideline occupations. In the Hangzhou, Jiaxing, and Huzhou areas, sericulture accounts for about 25% of the total income from agriculture and sideline occupations.
    However, in recent years, the development of sideline occupations has been limited, and some types of sideline occupations have even shown a decline. Although the number of pigs raised in the two provinces has increased compared to the same period last year, it has not yet recovered to the level of the year before last. Compared with this year's plan, Jiangsu is short by 39%, and Zhejiang is short by 49.6%. Scattered and decentralized sideline occupations are decreasing in variety and decreasing greatly in output. For example, the Fanshen Agricultural Cooperative in Jiangning County used to operate more than 20 types of sideline occupations, but now only more than 10 types remain, and the output value of sideline occupations has dropped from 20%-30% of the total income from agriculture and sideline occupations to 10%-15%. In Zhejiang, the total output of handmade paper in 1954 was 71,415 tons, which decreased to 66,758 tons in 1955. The output of straw mats in the first quarter of this year decreased by 26.4% compared to the same period last year. The production of knitted gloves, which has a long history in the suburbs of Shanghai, was 110,000 dozens in 1954, but only 50,000 dozens in 1955.
    Why did this situation occur? The main problem is the lack of leadership in sideline production. Many places, because they are busy with agricultural cooperation and increased agricultural production, have not given due attention to the development of diverse economies by agricultural cooperatives; there are only general appeals and no specific measures. When agricultural cooperatives carry out production planning, they generally do not arrange for sideline production. For example, Qingshan Township in Fuyang County, Zhejiang, has more than 2,000 people but only more than 100 mu of cultivated land. In the past, their main source of livelihood was cutting bamboo and making paper. After the organization of cooperatives, the cooperative emphasized agricultural production and did not pay attention to sideline production. Members reflected that "even if each mu of land yields 2,000 jin, it is not enough to live on." Some areas have adopted the practice of restricting and compressing sideline production. For example, staff in Wangchun Township, Yin County, Zhejiang, publicly promoted to the masses that "engaging in agricultural production is glorious, and engaging in sideline production are all lazy people." Some staff in Guangfu District, Wu County, Jiangsu, threatened farmers, saying, "Whoever does embroidery has capitalist ideas." An agricultural cooperative in Jiading County restricted members from raising chickens on the grounds that "chickens eat the cooperative's grain," stipulating that each household is only allowed to raise one chicken, and whoever raises more than one will have 20 jin of grain deducted during distribution. The Xinrong Agricultural Cooperative in Tonglu County, in order to produce green manure, prohibited members from cutting green grass to feed pigs, and stipulated that whoever goes to the fields to cut grass to feed pigs will be fined ten work points. According to preliminary statistics in Jiangsu, in order to change the farming system, build water conservancy projects, and expand grain production from last winter to this spring, about 10,000 mu of mulberry trees were cut down in various places. In Tianhuadang, Chongde County, Zhejiang, 3,000 mu of marshes, which have always been rich in mulberry seedlings, have now been converted into rice fields. Chemical fertilizers allocated by the state to mulberry gardens are generally diverted to rice.
    Unreasonable purchase and sale prices of sideline products are also an important reason why sideline production cannot develop rapidly or even decline. In the past, farmers mostly engaged in sideline production during slack seasons as a supplementary income. Even if the purchase price of products was slightly lower, farmers still considered it worthwhile. Now that agricultural cooperation has been realized, the remuneration for agricultural labor has increased significantly; however, the remuneration for sideline labor is also set low due to the low purchase price of sideline products, so that ordinary members are eager to do farm work and are unwilling to engage in sideline production. Taking embroidery as an example, the remuneration for each laborer doing embroidery for one day is only 3 to 4 jiao, and the income for doing it for 300 days a year is only 90 to 120 yuan; while the same labor force engaged in agricultural production, doing 150 workdays a year, with each workday being about 1.3 to 1.5 yuan, can earn about 200 yuan. In the Wufeng Agricultural Cooperative in Yin County, Zhejiang, a semi-labor force engaged in agricultural labor can earn about 6 jiao for doing four work points a day; if engaged in sideline labor, weaving straw mats only earns 3.8 jiao a day, weaving lace only earns 2.8 jiao a day, and weaving golden silk grass hats only earns 4 jiao a day.
    Some agricultural production cooperatives excessively emphasize the unified management of sideline occupations, stipulating that pigs, chickens, ducks, etc., should all be raised collectively by the cooperative and not allowed to be raised privately by members; some cooperatives even stipulate that hairdressing, pot repairing, and sewing should all be managed uniformly by the cooperative. Such forced unification not only affects the income of members but also increases the expenses of the cooperative. Some agricultural cooperatives stipulate too much time for members' collective activities and do not arrange time for members to engage in sideline occupations. For example, the Xianfeng Agricultural Production Cooperative in Jiading County stipulates that full laborers must participate in the cooperative's labor for 350 days a year, so members' individually managed sideline occupations have to be suspended.
    Some handicraft cooperative organizations interfere too much with the handicrafts operated by agricultural cooperatives, demanding centralized unification; some supply and marketing cooperatives have made many inappropriate restrictions on the sideline production of agricultural cooperatives in terms of raw material supply and product sales. For example, the first agricultural production cooperative in Wulong Township, Dantu County, Jiangsu, has a total of 303 households, and almost every household used to weave reed mats in the evenings and during slack seasons, with an annual income of about 12,000 yuan. Now, a separate reed mat production cooperative has been established for centralized production; the agricultural cooperative's reed mat production has been greatly restricted in terms of raw material supply and product sales. Some places have also formulated many restrictive rules, restricting the development of sideline production by agricultural cooperatives.
    The reduction in the production of raw materials for sideline occupations also directly affects the development of sideline production. Because the production of raw materials for sideline occupations is not as cost-effective as the production of non-staple foods, many places have reduced the production of raw materials for sideline occupations. Wu County used to plant more than 10,000 mu of rush grass, but only more than 6,000 mu were planted last year, and the sideline occupation of weaving mats will soon have to stop work due to lack of materials; this year, the county has reduced the planting of rush grass to more than 5,000 mu, and it is estimated that the production of straw mats next year will be more difficult than this year. Zhejiang Province only planted 17,318 mu of rush grass this year, a decrease of 42.3% from the original plan. Also, in Fuyang, Longyou, and other places, there have been phenomena of cutting down bamboo and destroying mulberry and tea trees to grow grain. Some raw materials for sideline occupations have also reduced their supply to rural areas due to increased urban needs. For example, farmers in Yancheng Prefecture, Jiangsu, used to grow soybeans and mung beans for grinding tofu, opening flour mills, and raising pigs for fertilizer. Now, because of the unified purchase and sale of grain, most of the soybeans and mung beans are supplied to cities, leaving very little in rural areas. In addition, because these crops have low yields, many agricultural cooperatives are unwilling to plant them.
    These situations show that the key to developing rural sideline occupations lies in strengthening leadership. Therefore, it is necessary to widely educate cadres and the masses to make them realize the importance of implementing diversified operations and developing sideline production, and to overcome the bias of unilaterally emphasizing the development of agriculture and neglecting sideline occupations. After the Wu County Party Committee recently strengthened the leadership of rural sideline production, sideline production quickly rebounded. Taking the embroidery production in Guangfu District of the county as an example, the number of people participating in embroidery has increased from about 9,000 in the first quarter to 16,000 at present. Relevant business departments should cooperate closely, formulate sideline production plans for agricultural production cooperatives based on the principle of supply, production, and sales balance, and provide specific guidance for production. Agricultural production cooperatives should, based on the specific conditions at that time and place, and in accordance with the principle of being conducive to the development of sideline occupations and increasing the income of cooperatives and members, consider which sideline occupations should be managed uniformly by the cooperative and which sideline occupations should be managed by members themselves under the specific guidance of the cooperative. All sideline occupations that are beneficial to unified management and that the cooperative has the conditions to manage uniformly, such as large-scale fish farming, large-scale tree planting and afforestation, and other large-scale sideline occupations, should be managed uniformly by the cooperative; some, although unified management is better, but the cooperative lacks the conditions and experience for unified management, may first focus on individual management and gradually transition to unified management; for sideline occupations that can be managed uniformly and can also be managed by individual members, such as raising pigs, chickens, ducks, geese, rabbits, and weaving, individual management by members should be allowed and encouraged. All sideline occupations that are managed uniformly by the cooperative should give sideline producers reasonable remuneration, so that they receive remuneration no less than that of engaging in agricultural production (calculated on an annual basis); those with special skills should also be given some slightly higher remuneration.
    The purchase price of rural sideline products should be reasonably adjusted. At present, the purchase price of some sideline products is too low, and the purchase and sale price difference is too large. The main reason is that there are too many intermediate circulation links. Therefore, without reducing state revenue or increasing the burden on consumers, it is possible to appropriately adjust the purchase price of rural sideline products by improving the management of enterprises, streamlining institutions, reducing expenses, and reducing intermediate circulation links.
    The scope of agricultural production cooperatives' operation of sideline production should not be restricted too much. As long as they do not engage in commercial speculation and comply with the principle of supply, production, and sales balance, agricultural cooperatives and members can continue to operate all sideline occupations that farmers operated in the past. Handicraft, supply and marketing cooperative organizations and other departments should not only not restrict them but also provide strong support in terms of technical guidance, production and sales plans, raw material supply, and product sales. Agricultural cooperatives should develop the production of certain raw materials for sideline occupations in a planned way. The government should encourage this in terms of tax policies and price policies. As for products such as soybeans and mung beans, a certain amount should be reserved for farmers to process for consumption, taking into account both urban and rural areas, so that producers can benefit.

    江苏、浙江和上海郊区的农村副业为什么一度衰落了
    济农
    江苏、浙江和上海郊区农村不仅有发达的农业，而且有丰富多样的副业。农民兼营的副业种类很多。例如，苏州专区农民兼营的副业就有养殖、手工艺、农产品加工、运输等六大类计二百多种。其中仅养猪、养鱼、养蚕、织布、刺绣、花边、酿酒等二十七种副业生产，1955年的总产值就有一亿四千五百十二万元，占农副业总产值的23.08％。杭州、嘉兴、湖州地区的蚕桑生产，占农副业总收入的25％左右。
    但是，近年来副业发展不大，有若干种类的副业还出现了衰落的现象。两省养猪数量比去年同期增加了，但是还没有恢复到前年水平，和今年计划比较，江苏少39％，浙江少49.6％。零星的、分散的副业，种类日益减少，产量大大下降。如江宁县翻身农业合作社，过去经营二十多种副业，现在只剩下十多种，副业产值由占农副业总收入的20％—30％降为10％—15％。浙江的土纸生产，1954年的总产量为七万一千四百十五吨，1955年下降到六万六千七百五十八吨，草席产量今年第一季度的产量比去年同期下降26.4％。上海郊区具有悠久历史的织花手套，1954年产量为十一万打，1955年只有五万打。
    为什么会出现这种情况呢？主要问题在于副业生产缺乏领导。很多地方因为忙于农业合作化和农业增产，对农业合作社发展多种经济，没有给予应有的重视；只有一般号召，没有具体措施。在农业合作社进行生产规划的时候，对副业生产一般没有进行安排。如浙江富阳县青山乡二千多人，只有一百多亩耕地，过去一直是以伐竹造纸等为主要生活来源，组织合作社后，社里强调以农业生产为主，不注意副业生产。社员反映“就是每亩田收二千斤也不够生活。”有些地区采取了限制和压缩副业生产的做法。如浙江鄞县望春乡工作人员公开对群众宣传“从事农业生产是光荣的，搞副业生产都是懒汉”。江苏吴县光福区有些工作人员威胁农民说：“谁去做刺绣，谁就有资本主义思想。”嘉定县有一个农业合作社限制社员养鸡，理由是“鸡会吃社里粮食”，规定每户只准养一只鸡，谁多养一只，分配的时候扣二十斤粮食。桐庐县新容农业合作社为了沤绿肥，禁止社员割青草养猪，并且规定谁到田里割草养猪，罚工十个。据江苏初步统计，去冬今春为了改变耕作制度、兴修水利，扩大粮食生产，各地共砍挖桑树一万亩左右。浙江崇德县天花荡三千亩荡地，一向盛产桑苗，现在都改为稻田。国家分配给桑园的化学肥料，普遍被移用于水稻。
    副业生产品购销价格不合理，也是副业生产不能很快发展甚至下降的一个重要原因。过去，农民多半是在农闲时间从事副业生产，把它作为一项辅助收入。即使产品收购的价格稍低一些，农民还是认为合算的。现在农业合作化了，农业劳动的报酬显著提高了；但副业劳动报酬因为副业产品收购价格偏低，也定得低，以致一般社员都争做农活，而不愿从事副业生产。以刺绣为例，每个劳动力做一天刺绣的报酬只有三角到四角，全年做三百天，收入也只有九十元到一百二十元；而同等劳动力从事农业生产，全年做一百五十个劳动日，每个劳动日约一元三角到一元五角，则可收入二百元左右。浙江鄞县五丰农业合作社，一个半劳动力从事农业劳动，每天做四分工，约可得六角；如果从事副业劳动，编织草席每天仅得三角八分，编织花边每天仅得二角八分，编织金丝草帽每天仅得四角钱。
    有些农业生产合作社过分强调副业统一经营，规定猪、鸡、鸭等一律由社集体公养，不准社员私养；有些合作社甚至规定，理发、补锅、缝纫都由社统一经营。这样勉强统一，不仅影响了社员的收入，而且增加了社的开支。有的农业合作社对社员的集体活动时间规定得太多，对社员从事副业的时间没作安排。如嘉定县先锋农业生产合作社规定，整劳力全年参加社的劳动，要达到三百五十天，这样社员个人经营的副业只好停顿下来。
    有些地方的手工业合作组织对农业合作社经营的手工业干涉过多，强求集中统一；有些供销合作社在原料供应和产品推销方面，对农业合作社的副业生产作了许多不适当的限制。如江苏丹徒县五龙乡第一农业生产合作社，共有三百零三户，过去差不多每家都利用晚上和农闲时间编芦席，每年收入约一万二千多元。现在这里单独成立了一个芦席生产合作社集中生产；农业合作社的芦席生产，在原料供应和产品推销方面都受到了很大限制。有些地方还制定了许多清规戒律，限制农业合作社发展副业生产。
    副业原料生产的减少，也直接影响副业生产的发展。由于副业原料生产不如副食生产合算，许多地方压缩了副业原料的生产。吴县过去种植席草一万多亩，去年只种了六千多亩，编织席子的副业很快就要停工待料；今年全县种植席草更减少到五千多亩，估计明年的草席生产比今年更要困难。浙江全省今年仅种植席草17，318亩，比原计划减少42.3％。又如富阳、龙游等地发生了砍伐毛竹毁掉桑茶改种粮食的现象。还有些副业原料，因为城市的需要增加，对农村的供应减少了。如江苏盐城专区农民发生了过去种植大豆、绿豆，用来磨豆腐、开粉坊、养猪积肥。现在因为粮食统购统销，大豆、绿豆大部分供应城市，农村留下极少，加上这种作物产量低，很多农业合作社不愿意种植。
    这些情况说明，要使农村副业发展起来，关键在于加强领导。因此，就要广泛地教育干部和群众，使他们认识实行多种经营、发展副业生产的重要性，克服片面强调发展农业，忽视副业的偏向。吴县县委最近加强了农村副业生产的领导以后，副业生产很快回升。以这个县光复区的刺绣生产为例，目前参加刺绣的人数已经由第一季度的九千人左右增加到一万六千人。各有关业务部门要密切配合，根据供产销平衡的原则，帮助农业生产合作社制定副业生产规划，具体指导生产。农业生产合作社应该根据当时当地的具体条件，本着有利于副业发展、有利于社和社员增加收入的原则，考虑哪些副业应该由社统一经营，哪些副业该在社的具体指导下由社员自己经营。凡是统一经营有利，而社里又有条件统一经营的，如大面积养鱼、大片植树造林，以及其他较大宗的副业，应当由社统一经营；有些虽以统一经营为好，但社里统一经营的条件不足、经验不够的情况下，可先以个人经营为主，逐步转为统一经营；对既可以统一经营，又可以由社员个人经营的副业，如养猪、鸡、鸭鹅、兔和编织等家庭副业，应该允许并且鼓励社员个人经营。凡是由社统一经营的副业，都要给副业生产者合理的报酬，使他们得到不低于从事农业生产的报酬（按全年计算）；有特殊技术的，还应该给予一些稍高的报酬。
    农村副业产品的收购价格要合理调整。目前有一些副业产品的收购价格偏低，购销差价过大，主要原因是中间流转环节太多，因此，在不减少国家收入，不增加消费者负担的前提下，通过改进企业的经营管理，精简机构，削减开支，减少中间流转环节，从而适当调整农村副业产品收购价格，是可能的。
    农业生产合作社经营副业生产的范围，不应当限制过多。只要不进行商业投机，并且符合供产销平衡的原则，凡是过去农民所经营的副业，农业合作社和社员都可以继续经营，手工业和供销合作社组织等部门不仅不应该加以限制，而且要在技术指导、产销计划、原料供应、产品推销等方面予以大力支持。农业合作社应有计划地发展某些副业原料的生产。政府应在税收政策价格政策等方面加以鼓励。至于大豆、绿豆等产品应本城乡兼顾的原则，留一定数量给农民加工食用，使生产者有利可得。
