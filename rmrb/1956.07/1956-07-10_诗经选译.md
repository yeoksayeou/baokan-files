Shu Wei (The State of Bei)

The people are on duty and serving, not able to rest even when the day is late. They express the following grievances against the ruler who enslaves them:

	The day is getting late,
	The day is getting dark,
	Why not go home?
	If it weren't for the many affairs of the officials,
	Why would we bear the dew drops every night!
	The day is getting late,
	The day is getting dark,
	Why not go home?
	If it weren't for the master cherishing his noble body,
	Why would we be covered in water and dragging through the mud!

[Original Text] 式微，式微，胡不歸？微君之故，胡為乎中露！式微，式微，胡不歸？微君之躬，胡為乎泥中！

Xiao Xing (The State of Shao)

A minor official is on a business trip, rushing on his way through the night. Thinking of the unequal distribution of labor and leisure between the noble and the lowly, he laments that his fate is not as good as others.

	Small stars twinkle faintly,
	Three or five appear in the east.
	Hurriedly rushing on the road at midnight,
	Busy for the officials from morning till night.
	Everyone has a fate, everyone is different!
	Small stars twinkle faintly,
	The Pleiades are next to Orion.
	Hurriedly rushing on the road at midnight,
	I have to carry my own quilt and curtain.
	Everyone has a fate, everyone is stronger than me!

[Original Text] 嘒彼小星，三五在東。肅肅宵征，夙夜在公。實命不同。嘒彼小星，維參與昴。肅肅宵征，抱衾與裯。實命不猶。

Fu Yi (The State of Zhou)

This is a song sung by women when collecting plantain seeds. It begins with a general statement of going to collect, and ends with a full load and returning home. The joy can be seen from this journey.

	Plantain seeds are gathered, gathered,
	Gather them quickly.
	Plantain seeds are gathered, gathered,
	Gather them quickly.
	Plantain seeds are gathered, gathered,
	Pick them up one by one.
	Plantain seeds are gathered, gathered,
	Rake them down by the handful.
	Plantain seeds are gathered, gathered,
	Hold them up in the lapel of the dress.
	Plantain seeds are gathered, gathered,
	Tuck up the lapel and bring them back.

[Original Text] 采采芣苢，薄言采之。采采芣苢，薄言有之。采采芣苢，薄言掇之。采采芣苢，薄言?之。采采芣苢，薄言袺之。采采芣苢，薄言襭之。

    诗经选译
    余冠英
    式微（邶风）
    人民当差应役，到天晚还不得休息，对于奴役他们的君主发出如下的怨言。
    天要晚啦，
    天要黑啦，
    为啥不回家？
    要不是官家事儿多，
    咱哪会露水珠儿夜夜驮！
    天要晚啦，
    天要黑啦，
    为啥不回家？
    要不是主子养贵体，
    咱哪会浑身带水又拖泥！
    〔原文〕式微，式微，胡不归？微君之故，胡为乎中露！式微，式微，胡不归？微君之躬，胡为乎泥中！
    小星（召南）
    小臣出差，连夜赶路，想到尊卑之间劳逸不均，自怨命不如人。小小星儿闪着微微亮，三颗五颗出现在东方。急急忙忙半夜来赶路，为了官家早忙晚也忙。人人有命人人不一样！小小星儿闪着微微亮，旄头星儿挨在参星旁。急急忙忙半夜来赶路，被子帐子都得自己抗。人人有命人人比我强！
  〔原文〕嘒彼小星，三五在东。肃肃宵征，夙夜在公。实命不同。嘒彼小星，维参与昴。肃肃宵征，抱衾与裯。实命不犹。
    芣苢（周南）
    这是妇女采集芣苢时所唱的歌，开始是泛言往取，最后是满载而归，欢乐之情可以从这历程见出来。车前子儿采呀采，采呀快快采些来。车前子儿采呀采，采呀快快采起来。车前子儿采呀采，一颗一颗拾起来。车前子儿采呀采，一把一把捋下来。车前子儿采呀采，手提着衣襟兜起来。车前子儿采呀采，掖起了衣襟兜回来。
  〔原文〕采采芣苢，薄言采之。采采芣苢，薄言有之。采采芣苢，薄言掇之。采采芣苢，薄言?之。采采芣苢，薄言袺之。采采芣苢，薄言襭之。
