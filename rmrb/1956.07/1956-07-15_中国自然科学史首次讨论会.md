Xinhua News Agency, 13th: The first scientific discussion meeting on the history of natural science in China concluded today after four days of discussion. This discussion meeting was convened by the Research Committee on the History of Natural Science of China under the Chinese Academy of Sciences.

Guo Moruo, President of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, spoke at the closing ceremony. He said that the study of the history of natural science and technology in China is very important, because this science can directly serve the people and can carry out patriotic education and enhance national self-esteem through these studies. He hoped that the study of the history of natural science and technology would promote the debate on the issue of historical periodization to reach a conclusion soon.

More than 80 experts and researchers in agronomy, biology, medicine, mathematics, astronomy, history, archeology and philosophy from all over the country participated in the discussion meeting.

On the first day of the discussion meeting, Zhu Kezhen, Vice President of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, made a special report on "Letting a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend and Excavating the Scientific Heritage of the Motherland." He said that researchers should accurately assess the position of ancient Chinese science in the history of human culture, so that the study of the history of natural science can serve the socialist construction cause, and help cultural exchange and peace among all nations in the world.

The conference read and discussed in groups a total of twenty-three special research papers on the historical development of agronomy, biology, medicine, mathematics, and astronomy. These papers cover the important contributions of ancient Chinese medicine, pharmacy, agriculture, and astronomy.

Long Bojian of the Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine specifically demonstrated in his paper that the Huangdi Neijing (The Yellow Emperor's Classic of Internal Medicine) is the oldest complete and outstanding medical masterpiece in China. He pointed out that this masterpiece has the same important contribution as the complete works of the ancient Greek Hippocrates, who was regarded as the father of medieval medicine.

In terms of papers on the history of medicine, there were also studies on the contributions of forensic medicine in the motherland, the achievements of medicine in the Ming Dynasty, the history of ancient otolaryngology and other diseases, and the achievements of ancient times in pharmacy. In a paper on the spread of the motherland's medical culture overseas, the contribution of Chinese medicine to world medicine was demonstrated from many aspects.

Shi Shenghan, a professor at Northwest Agricultural College, analyzed the works of Fan Shengzhi, an agronomist of the Han Dynasty, on agricultural experience in the Yellow River basin. Wan Guoding, a professor at Nanjing Agricultural College, analyzed the book "Qimin Yaoshu" on agricultural science written by Jia Sixie, an agronomist of the Later Wei Dynasty. This book includes all aspects of agricultural cultivation, from sowing and harvesting to agricultural processing, and also includes animal husbandry.

There were a total of four papers on the history of astronomy, including discussions on the basic viewpoints of the history of ancient Chinese astronomy and calendar. Liu Xianzhu, a professor at Tsinghua University, systematically elaborated on the development history of ancient Chinese timekeeping devices and their contributions to the world in his paper on timekeeping devices.
