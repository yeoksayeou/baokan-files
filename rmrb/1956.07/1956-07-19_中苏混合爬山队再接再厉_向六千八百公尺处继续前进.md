Xinhua News Agency, Mustagh Ata, July 18th: The members of the Sino-Soviet joint mountaineering team began their second assault on the "Father of Ice Mountains" at 5:30 PM (local time) on the 17th. This time they will establish the fourth high-altitude camp at an altitude of approximately 6,800 meters.

Throughout the 17th, dark clouds shrouded the mountainside of Mustagh Ata. Climbing to 6,800 meters presents even greater difficulties. The air is even thinner, the air pressure is lower, and the temperature drops sharply. When team leader Berezin issued the order for the second assault, the mountaineers quickly prepared new high-altitude equipment: extremely light and warm sweaters, chest harnesses, down gloves, and various fruits and canned meats needed for the next five days. Each person carried 23 to 25 kilograms of equipment. Aviation gasoline was brought for all gas stoves to ensure easy combustion at high altitudes. During the first assault, when ordinary gasoline was used in the gas stoves, it took two to three hours to boil a pot of water.

In the two to three days before this departure, the mountaineers underwent examinations of heart and blood vessel function after climbing, and the general response was good. To enable the team members to quickly recover their strength after the first climb, the meals in recent days have been supplemented with vitamins B and C, as well as the traditional Chinese medicine Schisandra tincture to calm the nerves. Fresh cucumbers, tomatoes, and apples recently shipped from the Soviet Union have become a favorite food of both Chinese and Soviet athletes. The Chinese team members also made dumplings and shared a meal with the Soviet team members.

The second ascent on the 17th involved a total of thirty people, including the newly arrived Soviet Merited Athlete and cameraman from the Moscow Central Documentary Film Studio, A.I. Sidorenko, and Soviet Master of Sports V. Kovalev. Soviet team members Ivanov, Chernosliv, Shenachev, and translator Vasily Zov did not participate in this climb.

    中苏混合爬山队再接再厉
    向六千八百公尺处继续前进
    新华社慕士塔格山18日电中、苏混合爬山队队员十七日下午五时半（当地时间）向冰山之父开始第二次进军。这次他们将到拔海六千八百公尺左右的地方建立第四号高山宿营地。
    十七日整天，阴云笼罩着慕士塔格山山腰。攀登六千八百公尺的高度，困难更多。那里氧气更加稀薄，气压更低，温度也急骤降低，当队长别列次基发出第二次进军的命令后，爬山队员们迅速地准备新的高山装备：极轻暖的毛衣、胸带、鸭绒手套和五天内所需要的各种水果，肉食罐头。每个人的随身带的物品达二十三公斤到二十五公斤。并且给气炉全部带上了航空汽油，以便在高山上容易燃烧。在第一次进军时气炉用普通汽油时，一锅开水要烧两三个钟头。
    这次出发的前两三天，爬山队员都经过了爬山后心脏和血管功能的检查，一般反应很好。为了使队员在第一次爬山后迅速恢复体力，这几天伙食上增加了维他命B和维他命C，以及服用镇静神经的中药五味子酊。最近从苏联运来的新鲜黄瓜、蕃茄和苹果成了中、苏两国运动员共同爱好的食品。中国队员还做了一次水饺，和苏联队员共餐。
    十七日第二次登山人数共三十人，其中包括新近到达山下的苏联功勋运动员、莫斯科中央纪录电影制片厂摄影师阿·伊·西多连科和苏联运动健将符·科瓦廖夫。苏联队员伊万诺夫、切尔诺斯利夫、谢纳乔夫，翻译瓦西里佐夫这次没有爬山。
