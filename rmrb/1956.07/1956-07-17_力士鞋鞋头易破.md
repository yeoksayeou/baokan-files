    Li Shi Shoes' Toes Easily Break
    Generally, the rubber shoes currently produced in our country are softer and more durable than in the past. However, there are still imperfections. I bought a pair of "Double Lion Ball" brand white Li Shi shoes produced by the jointly owned Guangming Rubber Factory for long-distance running practice. I wore them for thirty minutes every day, and after eighty days (i.e., continuously wearing them for forty hours), the toes were broken beyond recognition. Some comrades said that other brands of Li Shi rubber shoes also have the same problem. When rubber factories make this kind of cloth-faced rubber-soled shoes in the future, it would be best to pad the front and back of the shoes with a small piece of thin rubber. (Xie Weinan)

    力士鞋鞋头易破
    现在我国生产的胶鞋，一般是比过去柔软耐穿了。但是还有美中不足的地方。我买了一双公私合营光明橡胶厂生产的双狮球牌白力士鞋，是为练习长距离赛跑用的。每天穿它跑三十分钟，穿了八十天（即连续穿四十小时），鞋头就破的不像样了，据有些同志说，别种牌号的力士胶鞋也有同样毛病。希望橡胶厂再做这种布面胶底鞋的时候，最好把鞋前头和后跟垫上一小块薄胶皮。　　（谢为楠）
