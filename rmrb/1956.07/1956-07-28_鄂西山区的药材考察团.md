Xinhua News Agency, Enshi, 26th: On July 22nd, a medicinal herb survey team appeared in Longdong Township, Enshi County, a scenic area in the western Hubei mountains. On this day, the team members discovered a rare medicinal herb, Polygonatum sibiricum, on the mountains of Longdong Township, and also collected many medicinal herb specimens.

This survey team is composed of five units, including the Hubei Provincial Department of Health and Wuhan Medical College. Among them are Professor Ni Debo from Wuhan Medical College and veteran physician Zheng Hongjun from the Wuhan Chinese Medicine Administration. Some of the old professors in the survey team were climbing steep mountains for the first time, but wearing straw hats, they still searched for medicinal herbs with great energy under the scorching sun, carefully observing their growth. The high mountains of the eight counties belonging to the western Hubei mountains are home to a large number of medicinal herbs and are the main medicinal herb producing areas in Hubei Province. The survey team plans to investigate the distribution, growth and development of various medicinal herbs in the western Hubei mountains when the herbs are flowering and fruiting in July and August, collect medicinal herb specimens, and report to the Chinese Academy of Sciences after research and collation.

    鄂西山区的药材考察团
    新华社恩施26日电　七月二十二日，在鄂西山区恩施县风景秀丽的龙洞乡，出现了一个药材考察团。这天，团员们在龙洞乡的大山上发现了一种稀有药材：黄精，还采集了许多药材的标本。
    这个考察团是由湖北省卫生厅和武汉市医学院等五个单位组成的。其中有武汉医学院倪德薄教授和武汉中药管理处老医师郑洪钧。考察团中有些老教授还是第一次攀登峻峭的大山，但是他们戴着草帽，在烈日下仍然精神百倍地寻觅着药材，细心观察它们的生长情况。鄂西山区所属八个县的高山上都生长着大量的药材，是湖北省的主要药材产地。这个考察团计划在七、八月份药材开花结果的时候，在鄂西山区考察各种药材的分布、生长和发展情况，搜集药材标本，研究整理后向中国科学院汇报。
