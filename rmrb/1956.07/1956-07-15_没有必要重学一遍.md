    No Need to Relearn
    I am a staff member of the International Bookstore. I have already studied political economy in university and achieved excellent grades. However, according to the regulations for theoretical study in government organizations, I must study this subject again. I believe this is a waste of study time. I suggest that the leadership allow cadres like us who have already studied political economy to use this time to study specialized business or natural sciences. (A Reader)

    没有必要重学一遍
    我是国际书店的工作人员，在大学里已经学过政治经济学，并且获得了优良的成绩。但是，现在按照机关理论学习的规定，还要把这门课重新学习一遍。我认为，这样是浪费学习时间。我建议领导上允许我们已经学过政治经济学的干部，利用这一时间学习专门业务或自然科学。　（一读者）
