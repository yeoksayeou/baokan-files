Volunteer Army One Day

    Van Fleet's "Grand Finale"
    By Deputy Regiment Commander Huang Hao

    Editor's Note: "Volunteer Army One Day" is a true record of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army's struggle against the United States and aiding Korea. This book will be published by People's Literature Publishing House in October this year. Here, we have selected a few articles to share with our readers first.

      In early 1953, the First Battalion of my regiment was guarding the "205" Highland in the Chengshan and Zhishan Cave area northwest of Tieyuan. We usually called this highland "Dingzi Mountain," and the enemy also called it "Dingxing Mountain" (Nail Mountain), because its shape was like a nail, with the tip of the nail directly inserted into the enemy's position. This terrain was almost surrounded by the enemy on three sides, which was conducive to the enemy attacking us, but it also seriously threatened the enemy. Therefore, the soldiers guarding the "205" Highland said, "Our nail has firmly nailed the enemy's heart!"

    From January 20th, significant changes suddenly occurred there. The number of enemy shells falling every day increased from 500 to more than 2,000; on the 24th, enemy aircraft dispatched as many as 148 sorties, bombing in turn for six consecutive hours; small groups of enemies came out to scout every night; the enemy released a large amount of smoke in front of the position to cover transportation; and small jeeps came to the front to observe closely...

    All these signs indicated that the enemy wanted to launch a large-scale offensive here. In response to the changes in the enemy's situation, we also actively carried out various preparations to meet the enemy. The regimental headquarters sent me to personally take charge of the situation in the First Battalion and command the battle; Battalion Chief of Staff Dai Qizhen went down to the tunnel of the First Company headquarters in the front line.

    At around 8:00 AM on the 25th, three enemy reconnaissance planes appeared, circled twice over the battalion headquarters, and dropped two red smoke bombs towards Chengshan and "205" Highland. As soon as I walked down the tunnel, the mountain and the ground shook. The enemy launched a fierce artillery attack on our position. In less than an hour, all telephone lines connecting to the division, regiment, and company were cut off.

    The artillery bombardment continued until 12:30 PM, when the enemy deployed more than 30 tanks, covering a reinforced battalion, approaching our front line. Then, a company came up aggressively.

    The First Platoon of the First Company was at the forefront to meet the enemy. They jumped out of the tunnel with a squad, scattered in the trenches, and fought under the command of the platoon leader. Because the enemy used "human wave" tactics, pushing up in waves, the soldiers found it too slow to use submachine guns, so they threw handfuls of grenades at the enemy.

    I determined that the enemy was attempting to deplete us through continuous attacks. We were no strangers to the enemy's despicable trick of using the lives of their soldiers as a bet. I immediately ordered the battalion chief of staff, who was directing the battle in the First Company, to conserve ammunition, preserve our strength, and prepare to meet a possible larger enemy offensive. Therefore, only a few people were on the outside to meet the enemy in our front line, and the other soldiers were hiding in the tunnel pulling the pins of grenades. Box after box of grenades were constantly passed out, which not only supplied the ammunition to the soldiers who were engaging the enemy in a timely manner, but also avoided unnecessary casualties.

    The intensity of this battle exceeded any previous one. The enemy's artillery fire tightly blocked every large and small passage of ours, and the communication trenches were all blasted into "inverted figure eight" shapes, and some places were completely leveled. However, every time the enemy attacked, they still left piles of corpses in front of our position, and fled down the mountain in embarrassment.

    The fierce battle continued until 4:00 PM. The enemy repeatedly launched eight fierce attacks on our position. Three of them even used a group charge of two companies rushing up, but they were all defeated by us. The front line reported that the grenades prepared for five or six days were almost used up in these few hours, and requested a quick replenishment of ammunition. I ordered the front line to conserve ammunition and persist in the battle, while directing the battalion's artillery fire to strike the enemy. At the same time, I sent a liaison to the regimental headquarters to prepare to use the division's artillery fire, and planned to send out the reserve team when it got dark.

    However, all these preparations were not used. The front suddenly reported, "The enemy is using tanks, heavy artillery, machine guns, and smoke bombs to cover the infantry's retreat." Our main force hasn't even been brought out yet, and they are already cleaning up the mess! We can't let them get away with this! I immediately ordered all the weapons and artillery on the position to bombard the enemy's retreat route. By 5:00 PM, all the living enemies had fled, and only a few tanks were left in front of the position, hiding in the smoke screen to cover the armored vehicles dragging away the corpses.

    When cleaning the battlefield at dusk, the hillsides were covered with American steel helmets and nylon bulletproof vests with holes in them. The most interesting thing was that they also picked up large bags of explosives. This was what the enemy wanted to use to blow up our tunnels, but these bandits didn't even get a glimpse of the tunnel entrance!

    In this battle, the American invading army used everything except warships. Airplanes, tanks, and artillery were all used. And the only ones who directly fought the enemy were no more than seventeen soldiers. The only weapons used to attack the enemy were 838 grenades and submachine guns and other infantry light weapons. Our heavy weapons didn't even get a chance to fire, and we completely defeated the enemy's modern land-air joint attack.

    This battle, although a little bigger and more intense, was not uncommon in our more than a year of positional defense operations. As usual, we submitted a "detailed battle report" to the higher authorities after the war, summarized the experience, and the staff and cadres were busy for a while and then it was over. However, things turned out to be beyond our expectations. Two days later, the division headquarters notified us by telephone that the battle on January 25th was not limited to the content listed in our "detailed battle report." In addition to greatly wounding and killing the enemy, we also had a special significance, that is, we gave General Van Fleet a "farewell" party.

    It turned out that this commander of the Eighth Army of the American invading army, during his two years of commanding the enemy's ground forces on the Korean front, sent thousands of soldiers to the front line as cannon fodder, but what he got in return was the "Limited Objective Offensive," the "Autumn Offensive," "Heartbreak Ridge," "Old Baldy," and "Triangle Hill"... a series of world-renowned defeats. The masters of Wall Street were no longer interested in him and replaced him. However, until the last minute before leaving Korea, he was unwilling to retract his crippled bloody hands, and chose "Dingzi Mountain," a position favorable for attack, as the target of attack, dreaming of making a final profit to cover up his embarrassing downfall.

    On the 25th, when our soldiers, braving the enemy's plane and artillery bombardment, threw bundles of grenades at the enemy, Van Fleet was inviting a group of "senior officials" and foreign journalists to the battlefield on the enemy's position to watch the "grand finale" he directed. Those spectators who were invited to the scene were each holding a "cardboard-bound, three-color exquisitely printed" "attack route map" and "operation progress schedule", fully believing that this "land-air joint attack" would quickly occupy the mountain, and then they could boast about this ever-defeated general and save face before leaving. But what was the result? Listen to their confession. According to the US "Associated Press" report: they observed that "this offensive by the Allied forces was repelled by the communists, who the Allied forces thought had been shattered by artillery and aircraft." As a result, everyone from the United States to Britain shouted, saying that "the communists who held deep trenches on 'Nail Mountain' caused the Allied forces to lose face, and the most fierce attack carried out by the Allied forces in three months... was actually repelled by the communists." Many members of the US Congress questioned the Department of Defense, and even British members of parliament followed suit.

    Van Fleet, in this way, left his last shameful defeat and rolled out of Korea with his tail between his legs. In the future, when this "ill-fated" general recalls those Korean mountains that made him tremble--"Heartbreak Ridge," "Old Baldy," "Triangle Hill"... he probably will not forget this small "Dingzi Mountain" that made him unable to step down in the "grand finale"!

### 范佛里特的“压轴戏”

    范佛里特的“压轴戏”
    副团长　黄浩
    编者按：“志愿军一日”是一部反映中国人民志愿军抗美援朝斗争真实的纪录。这部书将在今年十月由人民文学出版社出版。这里，我们从中选出几篇，先同读者见面。
      1953年初，我团一营守卫在铁原西北的城山、芝山洞地区的“二○五”高地上。这个高地，我们习惯地叫它“丁字山”，敌人也叫它“丁形山”，因为它的形状像根钉子，钉尖直插到敌人阵地当中。这样的地形，几乎是三面临敌；有利于敌人进攻我们，但也严重地威胁着敌人。所以守在“二○五”高地上的战士们说：“我们这根钉子，把敌人的心给活活地钉住了！”
    从一月二十日起，那里突然发生了显著的变化。每天落下敌人的炮弹，由五百发增加到二千多发；敌机在二十四日那天竟出动一百四十八架次，轮番连续轰炸了六小时；每夜还有小股敌人出来偷摸；阵地前面敌人施放大量烟幕掩护运输；还有小吉普车到前沿抵近观察……
    这一切迹象，说明了敌人是想在这里发动一次大规模的进攻。针对敌情变化，我们也积极进行了各种迎敌的准备工作，团指挥所派我亲自到一营掌握情况，指挥战斗；营参谋长戴奇珍同志，下到了最前沿一连连部的坑道里。
    二十五日上午八点钟左右，三架敌人的侦察机出现了，在营指挥所上空兜了两个圈子，就向着城山和“二○五”高地，投下了两颗红色烟幕弹。我刚走下坑道，山头和地面都震动了起来，敌人向我们阵地开始了猛烈的炮袭。不到一小时，所有通向师、团、连的电话线，都给打断了。
    空炮轰击一直持续到十二点三十分，敌人摆开了三十多辆坦克，掩护着一个加强营，向我前沿接近。跟着，一个连就气势汹汹地攻上来了。
    在最前面迎击敌人的是一连一排，他们以一个班跃出坑道，散布在堑壕里，由一排长指挥战斗。因为敌人用的羊群战术，一批接一批波浪式的推上来；战士们连使用冲锋枪都嫌慢，就用满把满把的手榴弹砸向了敌人。
    我断定敌人这是企图用连续进攻的手段来消耗我们，敌人这种用自己士兵生命作赌注的卑鄙伎俩，对我们并不陌生。我立即命令在一连指挥战斗的营参谋长：一定要节省弹药，保存有生力量，准备迎击敌人可能发起的更大的进攻。因此，我们前沿一直是少数人在外面迎击敌人，其他战士都是隐蔽在坑道里揭手榴弹盖。成箱成箱的手榴弹不断地往外传递，这样及时供应了接敌战士们的弹药，又避免了不必要的伤亡。
    这次战斗的激烈，超过了以往任何一次。敌人的炮火严密的封锁着我们每条大小通道，交通沟都打成了“倒八字”，有的地方完全扫平了，但是敌人每一次进攻，还是照样地在我们阵地前面留下成堆的死尸，狼狈地滚下山去。
    激战一直进行到下午四点，敌人反复地向我阵地进行了八次凶猛的冲击，其中三次竟动用了两个连一拥而上的集团冲锋，但是都被我们打垮了。前沿报告情况说：准备用五、六天的手榴弹，在这几小时内都快全部打光了，要求快补充弹药。我一面命令前沿节省弹药，坚持战斗；一面指挥营属炮火打击敌人。同时向团指派出联络，准备动用师属炮火，并打算待天黑就出动预备队。
    可是，这一切准备都没有用上，前面忽然报告说：“敌人正用坦克、重炮、机枪，和烟幕弹掩护步兵撤退。”我们的主力还没拿出来，它倒在收拾破烂摊子了！这也不能放过它！我立即命令阵地上，所有能使用上的武器，炮火，一齐轰击敌人退路。到下午五点，活着的敌人全部逃光，阵地前面只剩下几辆坦克，躲在烟幕里掩护装甲车拖死尸。
    黄昏打扫战场的时候，山坡上到处是开了洞的美国钢盔和尼龙避弹衣，最有意思的是还拾回了大包大包的炸药。这是敌人想用来炸我们坑道的，但这些匪徒们却连坑道口都没有望到！
    这一场战斗，美国侵略军除了兵舰不能来以外。飞机、坦克、大炮，什么都使用上了。而我们直接迎战的，前后不过是十七名战士；用来打击敌人的全部武器，也只是八百三十八颗手榴弹和冲锋枪等这些步兵轻火器。我们的重火器根本没捞到开火，就把敌人这场现代化的陆、空联合攻击彻底打垮了。
    这次战斗，虽然大一点，激烈一些，可是在我们一年多的阵地防御作战中，也并不算什么希罕。我们照例在战后向上级作了“战斗详报”，总结了一下经验，参谋和干事们忙了一阵也就过去了。然而，事情却出乎我们的意料之外，两天以后，师指挥所从电话中通知说：一月二十五日那天的战斗，并不止于我们那份“战斗详报”中所列举的内容。我们除了大大的杀伤敌人以外，还有一个特别的意义，那就是给范佛里特将军“饯”了“行”。
    原来，这位美国侵略军第八军军长，在两年来指挥朝鲜前线敌军地面部队作战时期，把成千上万的士兵送上火线当了炮灰，但换得的却是“有限目标攻势”，“秋季攻势”、“伤心岭”、“老秃山”，以及“上甘岭”……这一连串的举世闻名的败绩。华尔街的主子已经对他不感兴趣，把他撤换掉了。可是，直到离开朝鲜的前一分钟，他还不甘心缩回他那双打残废了的血手，又选择了“丁字山”这个有利于进攻的阵地作为攻击目标，梦想最后捞一笔本钱，掩饰他的狼狈下台。
    二十五日那天，当我们的战士们，冒着敌人的飞机大炮轰击，用成束手榴弹砸向往敌人的时候，在敌人阵地上，范佛里特正邀请了一群“高级官员”和各国新闻记者，亲临战场前来观看他一手导演的“压轴戏”。那些应邀到场的看客们，还每人抱着本“纸板装订、三色精印”的“进攻路线图”和“作战进程时间表”，满以为这场“陆、空联合攻击”会很快的占领山头，然后，他们就可以为这位常败将军吹嘘一番，也好在临走前挽回点脸面。可是结果呢？听听他们的自供吧。据美国“合众社”报道说：他们观到的是“联军这次进攻，被那些联军以为已被大炮和飞机打得粉碎的共军击退了。”这一来，从美国到英国都叫开了，说什么“‘丁形山’上深沟据守的共军，使联军丢了脸，联军在三个月以来所进行的最猛烈的攻击……竟被共军击退。”等等，美国国会许多议员纷纷向国防部提出质问，连英国议员也跟着起哄了。
    范佛里特，就是这样留下了自己最后一次可耻的败绩，夹着尾巴滚出了朝鲜。今后，当这位“命运多舛”的将军，回忆起那些使他战栗的朝鲜山头——“伤心岭”、“老秃山”、“上甘岭”……的时候，大概也不会忘记这个使他在“压轴戏”中，下不了台的小小“丁字山”吧！
