This newspaper reports from Xi'an on the 17th of this month: Since the beginning of this year, 650,000 young people in the soil and water conservation areas of Shaanxi Province have participated in soil and water conservation work. They are the most active force in soil and water conservation work, and the amount of work they have completed accounts for more than half of the total task completed in the first half of the year.

This year, more than 12,000 youth shock brigades for soil and water conservation and afforestation have emerged in northern Shaanxi. Because they are constantly improving their techniques and carrying out socialist emulation, they generally exceed quotas by 40% to 60%, and some even exceed them by one to three times. For example, the Yulin Prefectural Committee of the Communist Youth League mobilized 150,000 young people to participate in the "Afforestation and Soil and Water Conservation Movement Month" in April. During the movement month, 2,706 youth shock brigades for afforestation and 2,844 youth shock brigades for soil and water conservation emerged. In one month, they afforested 116,226 mu, built 125,500 mu of terraced fields, built dams to create silted land of 31,825 mu, repaired 13,460 mu of field border ridges, and built 72,000 water cellars and water collectors. In one month, they completed more than 60% of the special district's full-quarter task.
