    "Turn barren land into green fields, and muddy water into clear streams"
    Shaanxi convenes a conference of young activists in water and soil conservation and afforestation
    (Our newspaper's report) The Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Youth League convened a provincial conference of young activists in water and soil conservation, afforestation, and forest protection in Suide from July 21st to 28th. Tang Hongcheng, Secretary of the Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, attended the meeting and gave important instructions.
    More than 70% of Shaanxi Province's land area suffers from soil erosion. This spring, more than two million young people (more than 80% of the total number of rural youth) in the province participated in the movement for water and soil conservation, afforestation, and forest protection. Together with adults, they completed various projects that can control soil erosion over an area of 8,100 square kilometers and afforest 2.1 million mu. The representatives who attended the conference unanimously stated that they were determined to control soil erosion in the province within seven years and contribute to the management of the Yellow River. More than 300 representatives introduced their experiences in carrying out water and soil conservation, afforestation, and forest protection in different regions at various thematic symposiums. Wu Chengye, director of the Wujiapan Agricultural Cooperative in Suide County, introduced his experience in comprehensively carrying out water and soil conservation work, improving engineering quality, and strengthening routine maintenance. Sun Shengfu, an old man from Yanchang County, introduced his family's century-old experience in building dams. Chen Zhimin, an old man from Zizhou County, introduced his experience in greening five gullies by himself. Wang Ernv from Yulin introduced her experience in collecting seeds and cultivating seedlings. Wang Xianli from Chang'an introduced his experience in creating a "forest fire-free township." These experiences are of great significance for further carrying out the water and soil conservation, afforestation, and forest protection movement. The representatives said with full confidence: "With these methods, we will definitely be able to 'turn barren land into green fields, and muddy water into clear streams.'"
