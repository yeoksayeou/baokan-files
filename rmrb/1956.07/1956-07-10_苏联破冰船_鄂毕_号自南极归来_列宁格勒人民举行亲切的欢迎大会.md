    Soviet Icebreaker "Ob" Returns from Antarctica
    Leningrad People Hold Cordial Welcome Rally
    (Our correspondent in Leningrad, July 8th) The Soviet icebreaker "Ob," having traversed the seas of Europe and Africa and completed a long voyage of 60,000 kilometers, returned to Leningrad from the Antarctic coast on July 8th.
    As the massive icebreaker, displacing 12,600 tons, approached Pier No. 8, the welcoming crowd and all personnel on board cheered in unison. Before the ship even docked, people were throwing flowers onto the deck. As people on the ship and ashore recognized relatives and friends, they excitedly called out names in affectionate tones. As soon as the ship docked, those returning from Antarctica were greeted with warm kisses and embraces from their loved ones and friends.
    Alongside the pier, the people of Leningrad held a welcoming rally for the return of the "Ob." Soviet Minister of Merchant Marine, Burkalov, said: The first scientific research base established by Soviet Antarctic scientists in Antarctica, the "Mirny" station, is of great significance for the future large-scale research of the Antarctic nature and the International Geophysical Year. In the near future, we will also go deep into Antarctica for 1,600 kilometers and more than 2,000 kilometers to establish two other scientific research bases, "Vostok" station and "Sovetskaya" station. Captain Man, representing all personnel on the "Ob," said: "Although we are far away from our motherland, we feel the care of the motherland for us every minute and every second. When we return to the coast of our motherland, we can say to the motherland: we have completed the task of crossing to Antarctica and establishing 'Mirny.' Now we are waiting to receive new tasks from the motherland."
    Since the brave Russian navigators Bellingshausen and Lazarev discovered the sixth continent, Antarctica, from 1819 to 1821, although there have been attempts to continue exploring the mysteries of this continent in the intervening 135 years, various natural obstacles have made Antarctica remain a blank spot on the map until now. The task of the Soviet Antarctic expedition this time is to participate in the Antarctic geological research work according to the decision of the Third International Geophysical Year. Observe various natural phenomena in Antarctica, such as the movement of the sun, the rays of moonlight, and measure the evolution of the earth, etc.
    The "Ob" set sail from Kaliningrad on November 30 last year. During these seven months, the exploration work was carried out under extremely dangerous conditions. Around Antarctica, there are icebergs and ice islands dozens of meters high everywhere. The "Ob" overcame all difficulties and approached the Knox Coast, and then used helicopters to transport thousands of tons of materials from the deck over high icebergs to the land. The entire area of ​​Antarctica is 14 million square kilometers; but on this vast land, it is covered with thick layers of ice. Some are shimmering blue, glass-like high mountains, and others are terrifying abysses of ice and snow. The climate there is harsh. Although there is no night in Antarctica, it is difficult to see the sun for years, and there are often violent blizzards raging, with temperatures below minus 50 degrees Celsius.
    This is a place where no human footprints have been left. Apart from seeing groups of penguins with white bellies and black backs, staring at the unfamiliar guests with surprised eyes, there is only a silent earth. At present, there is no detailed topographic map of Antarctica, so the expedition pilots can only fly according to a special astronomical compass. They rely on their arduous flights to draw a map of the voyage.
    Although the difficulties were so severe, through the efforts of the expedition's navigators, geologists, physicists, and other scholars, and all personnel on the "Ob," the Antarctic exploration base "Mirny" has been established on Haswell Island. This scientific town now not only has all the equipment necessary for scientific research, but also has its own powerful electricity broadcasting station and airport in order to create favorable conditions for large-scale Antarctic scientific research work next year.
    The Soviet Party and government gave great care to the Antarctic exploration work. The Gorky Automobile Factory and the Chelyabinsk Tractor Manufacturers specially made cars and tractors for them. Food factories and sewing factories in Moscow, Leningrad, Kazan, and Riga prepared delicious food and specially made cold-proof clothing for them. The Central Newsreel Film Studio also sent photographers to set off with the expedition to film 18,000 meters of documentaries about the "Ob" passing through the Atlantic Ocean, the Indian Ocean, and working in Antarctica. These films are all in color and will soon be shown to the audience. (Attached picture)

    苏联破冰船“鄂毕”号自南极归来
    列宁格勒人民举行亲切的欢迎大会
    本报列宁格勒8日电　经过了欧非两洲的海洋，进行了六万公里远程航行的苏联破冰船“鄂毕号”，已于七月八日从南极海岸回到了列宁格勒。
    当巨大的排水量达一万二千六百吨的破冰船驶近第八号码头的时候，欢迎的人群和船上的全体人员不约而同地欢呼起来。船还没有靠岸，人们就把鲜花扔到船上。船上和岸上的人们彼此发现亲友的时候，大家都带着激动的声音亲切地喊着名字。船刚靠岸，从船上走下的南极归来的人们，受到自己的亲人和朋友们的热吻和拥抱。
    在码头旁边列宁格勒人民为“鄂毕号”归来举行了欢迎大会。苏联海运部长布尔哈洛夫说：苏联南极科学工作者在南极建立的第一个科学研究基地——“和平”村，对于未来大规模研究南极自然界和世界地球物理学具有重大的意义。在不久的将来，我们还要深入南极洲一千六百公里和二千多公里，建立另外两个科学研究基地——“东方”站和“苏联”站。“鄂毕号”船长曼代表全体人员说：“我们虽然远离祖国，但是每分钟每秒钟都感到祖国对我们的关怀。当重新回到祖国海岸的时候，我们可以向祖国说：我们已经完成了远渡南极和建立‘和平’村的任务。现在我们在等待接受祖国给我们的新任务。”
    自从1819年到1821年，勇敢的俄国航海家别林斯高津和拉扎列夫发现了第六大洲——南极洲以后，在这135年中间，虽然也曾有人企图要继续深入查探这个大洲的神秘的地方，但终因各种天然的障碍，使得直到现在南极洲在地图上仍然是个空白。这次苏联南极探险队的任务是根据第三届国际地球物理学年会的决定，参加南极地质研究工作。观察南极的各种自然现象，例如太阳的行动，月光的射线，测定地球的演变等等。
    “鄂毕号”于去年十一月三十日从加里宁格勒起航。在这七个多月的时间里，探险工作是在异常险恶的条件下进行的。在南极洲的周围，到处都是几十公尺高的冰山和冰岛，“鄂毕号”排除了一切困难，靠近了诺克斯海岸，然后利用直升飞机，从甲板越过很高的冰山，把千百吨物资搬运到陆地上去。南极洲的整个面积是一千四百万平方公里；但在这广阔的土地上，到处复盖着深厚的冰层，有的是闪着蓝光的玻璃似的高山，有的则是可怕的冰雪的深渊。那里的气候是恶劣的，虽然在南极洲没有夜晚，但是成年累月也难见到太阳，经常有狂暴的大风雪在怒吼，气温在零下五十度。
    这是一个没有人类足迹的地方，除了可以看到一群群白肚黑背的企鹅，它们带着惊奇的目光注视着陌生的客人以外，只有万籁俱静的大地。目前关于南极洲的详情地形图还没有，所以探险的飞行员只能根据一种特制的天文指南针来飞行，他们依靠自己艰难的飞行以便绘制一幅航行的地图。
    困难虽然是这样的严重，但经过探险队的航海家、地质学家、物理学家以及其他学者和“鄂毕号”全体人员的努力，南极探险的基地“和平”村已经在哈斯威尔岛上建立起来了。这座科学小城现在不仅拥有科学研究所必需的一切设备，它还有自己的强大电力的广播站和飞机场。以便为明年大规模展开南极科学研究工作创造有利的条件。
    苏联党和政府对于南极探险工作给予了极大的关怀。高尔基汽车厂和齐良宾拖拉机制造者为他们特制了汽车和拖拉机。莫斯科、列宁格勒、喀山、里加的食品工厂和缝纫工厂为他们准备了美味的食物和特制的防寒服装。中央新闻电影制片厂还派遣了摄影师和探险队一同出发，拍摄了“鄂毕号”经过大西洋、印度洋以及在南极洲工作情形的一万八千公尺的纪录片。这些影片都是彩色的，不久将和观众见面。（附图片）
