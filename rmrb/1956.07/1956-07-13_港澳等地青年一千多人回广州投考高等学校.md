Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, July 12th: According to statistics on the 11th, more than 1,220 young people from Hong Kong, Macao, Indonesia, Malaysia, and other places have come to Guangzhou to take college entrance examinations. Among them are this year's and last year's high school graduates, university preparatory students, middle school teachers, and young people from society with a high school education level.

A student surnamed Li, who had already completed university preparatory courses in North Borneo, said: "The achievements made by the motherland in recent years are a great encouragement to me, and they strongly motivated me to return to the motherland from afar to study further." He hopes to work hard with the vast number of young people in the motherland to advance towards science.

Graduates from schools such as King's College and Queen's College in Hong Kong had received many Taiwan enrollment brochures printed with various so-called "preferential measures" while in Hong Kong, and had also encountered some "brokers" who were luring young people to Taiwan. However, they resolutely rejected all those special agent's temptations and came to Guangzhou.

Currently, these 1,220 plus examinees have all registered, and they have all determined their application choices according to their own strengths, interests, and the needs of the motherland's construction.

    港澳等地青年一千多人回广州投考高等学校
    新华社广州12日电　据十一日统计，从香港、澳门以及印度尼西亚、马来亚等地来到广州投考高等学校的青年，已达一千二百二十多人。他们当中有今年的和去年的高中毕业学生、大学预科学生、中学教员和有高中文化程度的社会青年。
    一位已经在北婆罗洲念完了大学预科的姓李的学生说：祖国几年来取得的成就对我是一种很大的鼓舞，它强烈地推动了我不远千里返回祖国来学习深造。他希望和祖国的广大青年一起努力向科学进军。
    从香港来的金文泰中学、皇仁书院等校的毕业生们在香港时曾经收到过许多印有各种所谓“优待办法”的台湾招生简章，还碰到过一些为台湾骗拉青年的“掮客”。但他们毅然拒绝了所有那些特务的诱惑而来到广州。
    现在，这一千二百二十多位考生都已经报了名，他们都是按照自己的特长、兴趣和结合祖国建设的需要确定报考志愿的。
