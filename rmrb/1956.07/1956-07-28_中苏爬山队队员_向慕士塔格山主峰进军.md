Xinhua News Agency, Muztagh Ata, July 27th (Xinhua News Agency reporter Yang Kexian reports): The Sino-Soviet mixed mountaineering team began its march towards the main peak of Muztagh Ata on the 26th.

　　At a little after 5 p.m. on the 26th (local time), the thirty-one Chinese and Soviet mountaineers and photographers participating in the ascent of the main peak set off in batches. They plan to spend more than seven days planting the national flags of China and the Soviet Union on the summit of Muztagh Ata, which is 7,546 meters above sea level.

　　After the first two high-altitude marches, the Sino-Soviet mixed mountaineering team has found a route to the main peak through the extremely complex and dangerous icefall area. They have also transported high-altitude supplies to the second, third, and fourth high-altitude camps. These supplies can last for ten days, which is more than the supplies carried by Soviet mountaineers in any previous mountain climbing expedition. More importantly, they have developed the high-altitude environmental adaptability necessary for climbing the main peak.

　　However, reaching altitudes above 7,000 meters (the famous British mountaineer E. Shipton once reached this height but had to descend unsuccessfully from there), where the oxygen is even more scarce and the temperature changes drastically; especially since the weather station predicts that the climate near Muztagh Ata may change recently, it will bring even greater difficulties to the Chinese and Soviet mountaineers than the previous marches. Therefore, the Sino-Soviet mixed mountaineering team has organized a reserve team of three led by Fu. P. Sibiryakov, an athlete with rich mountaineering experience (who newly arrived at the foot of the mountain on the 22nd), who also departed on the 26th. They will remain in the second and third high-altitude camps to support the climbers ascending the main peak if necessary.

### 中苏爬山队队员  向慕士塔格山主峰进军

    中苏爬山队队员
    向慕士塔格山主峰进军
    据新华社慕士塔格山27日电新华社记者杨克现报道：中、苏混合爬山队二十六日开始向慕士塔格山主峰进军。
    二十六日下午五点多钟（当地时间），参加攀登主峰的三十一名中、苏爬山运动员和摄影师们分批陆续出发，他们计划用七天多的时间，把中、苏两国国旗插在拔海7，546公尺的慕士塔格峰顶。
    中、苏混合爬山队经过前两次的高山行军，已经找到了通过极复杂和危险的冰瀑地带到达主峰的路线。他们还把高山给养运到第二、第三和第四号高山营地。这些给养可以用十天，比苏联爬山运动员过去任何一次爬山时携带的给养都要多。更重要的是他们已经锻炼出攀登主峰所必需的高山环境适应性。
    但是，到达拔海七千公尺（著名的英国爬山家埃·希普顿曾经登到这个高度，但不得不从这里失败下山。）以上的高度，那里的氧气更加缺乏；温度急骤变化；特别是气象台预报最近慕士塔格山附近的气候可能发生变化，它将给中、苏爬山队员带来比前几次行军更大的困难。因此，中、苏混合爬山队组织了一支以有丰富爬山经验的运动员符·普·西比尔科夫（他是二十二日新来到山下的）为首的三人后备队，二十六日同时出发，他们将留在第二和第三号高山营地，以便在必要时支援攀登主峰的队员。
