Xinhua News Agency, Rome, July 5th: According to TASS, the Italian newspaper "Unità" published an article by Palmiro Togliatti, General Secretary of the Italian Communist Party, on July 3rd.

    The article said: The transformation of the international communist movement is now so profound and extensive that it is difficult to estimate its full significance. The trend of the movement is towards socialism, peace, and democracy. This is a movement with diverse forms. The movement constantly encounters new and old problems, which are resolved under the conditions created by this unwavering and confident movement.

    Togliatti said that now there is not only one socialist country surrounded by various enemies in the world, but a system of socialist countries exists. I believe that capitalist leaders should have known long ago that it is a dream to hope to restore the old economic and social systems in those places where socialist societies have been built or are being built. The communist movement is transforming itself in the direction of strengthening socialist societies, towards faster and more confident communist construction, and towards maintaining more effective contact with the masses. It is impossible to go in the opposite direction, because all the discussions conducted in our ranks that help our movement move forward will not go in a direction that violates the principles of our movement. The enemy is unwilling and unable to understand this.

    However, the enemy exists, and they are powerful, rampant, and ruthless. Outside our camp, the enemy is strong, and even within our camp, they still have their forces and foothold. It would be terrible to forget this. The events in Poznan have deeply reminded us of this.

    Togliatti said that there is a saying that with the victory and development of socialism, the number of its enemies inevitably increases. We have criticized and refuted this statement, not only because it is wrong, but also because it is the source of wrong actions.

    The actual situation is not like this. The actual situation is that the victory of socialism brings more and more sympathy and more and more supporters to the side of socialism, and socialism becomes more and more effective. But the enemy still exists. They have not conceded and harbor all kinds of delusions.

    It is obvious that these enemies are by no means the working people who are extremely interested in solving their actual survival problems. It is impossible to have no difficulties hindering the satisfactory resolution of these problems in countries building socialism. The enemy is those who undermine efforts aimed at overcoming existing difficulties with fewer sacrifices, carry out provocations, use violence, and incite armed struggle against the socialist regime of the workers and the people.

    In a society where there are no more capitalists, the issues of labor, labor organization, and remuneration are not resolved by relying on guns. But how many guns can be fired by the $125 million allocated annually in the American budget for planning violence and carrying out provocations in non-capitalist countries?

    Togliatti said that the enemy attempts to lead us away from the path we have taken, spread confusion and defeatist sentiments, distort the truth, and use various methods to hinder the development of socialism and hinder the Communists from becoming the basic driving force of the great modern movement to liberate people from all kinds of shackles of slavery. Therefore, it is necessary to make every effort to enable the conscious and organized vanguard of the working class to oppose the enemy, isolate the enemy—which is easier to do today than at any other time—and defeat the enemy.

    Advanced political organizations among the workers and the masses, and the regular contact of these political organizations with the workers and the people—these conditions are, in any case, the main and decisive conditions for us Communists to prevent painful events like the Poznan incident from happening again.

    陶里亚蒂著文指出：
    共产主义运动的胜利发展不可阻挡
    工人阶级应努力反对敌人、孤立敌人、战胜敌人！
    新华社5日讯　据塔斯社罗马讯：七月三日意大利“团结报”刊载了意大利共产党总书记陶里亚蒂的一篇文章。
    文章说：现在国际共产主义运动的转变是如此深刻和广泛，以至现在很难估计它的全部意义。运动的趋向是社会主义、和平和民主的趋向。这是一种多种形式的运动。这个运动不断遇到新旧各种问题，这些问题在这个一往直前、确信不移的运动所创造的条件下获得解决。
    陶里亚蒂说，现在世界上并不是只有一个被各种敌人所包围的社会主义国家，而是存在着社会主义国家体系。我认为，资本主义的领导人早就应该知道，希望在那些已经建成或是正在建设社会主义社会的地方恢复旧的经济制度和社会制度，那是梦想。共产主义运动正在向加强社会主义社会的方向，向更迅速、更充满信心地进行共产主义建设的方向，向领导同人民群众保持更有效的联系的方向转变。向相反的方向走是不可能的，因为，在我们队伍中所进行的、有助于我们运动前进的一切讨论，都不会向违背我们运动的原则的方向走。敌人是不愿意，也不可能理解这一点的。
    可是，敌人是存在的，他们是有力量的、猖狂的和无情的。在我们阵营的外部，敌人是强大的，就是在我们阵营里面，也还有他们的势力和立足地。如果忘记这一点，那就糟了。在波兹南发生的事件使我们深深地记住了这一点。
    陶里亚蒂说，有这样一种说法：随着社会主义的胜利和发展，它的敌人的数目不可避免地跟着增加，我们批判了，驳斥了这种说法，这不仅因为它是错误的，而且因为它是错误的行动的根源。
    实际情况不是这样。实际情况是：社会主义的胜利把越来越多的同情、越来越多的拥护者争取到社会主义的一边，社会主义越来越有效。但是敌人仍然存在。他们没有让步，并且怀抱各种各样的妄想。
    很明显，这些敌人，绝不是对解决他们的实际生存问题感到极大兴趣的劳动人民。在建设社会主义的国家中不可能没有妨碍圆满解决这些问题的困难。敌人是这样一些人，他们破坏旨在以较少的牺牲来克服现存困难的努力，进行挑衅，使用暴力，煽起反对工人的，人民的社会主义政权的武装斗争。
    在那种再也没有资本家的社会里，劳动、劳动的组织和报酬的问题，不是依靠枪杆子来解决的。但是美国预算中每年用来在非资本主义国家里策划暴力和进行挑衅的一亿二千五百万美元的拨款，能够迫使多少支枪支发射呢？
    陶里亚蒂说，敌人企图使我们离开我们自己所走的道路，散布混乱和失败情绪，歪曲真相，利用各种方法阻碍社会主义的发展，阻碍共产党人成为争取使人们摆脱各种奴役枷锁的伟大的现代运动的基本动力。由此可见，必须尽一切努力使工人阶级有觉悟的、有组织的先锋队来反对敌人，孤立敌人——今天比其他时候更容易这样做——和战胜敌人。
    在工人和人民群众中有先进的政治组织，以及这种政治组织同工人和人民的经常联系——这些条件在任何情况下对我们共产党人来说都是使波兹南事件这类令人痛心的事实不再发生的主要的决定性的条件。
