Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, July 25th: Fujian Province will build a railway from Zhangping to Longyan. Railway survey and design personnel are collecting design data. This railway will start from Zhangping Station on the Yingtan-Xiamen Railway and extend to Longyan City, with a total length of about 70 kilometers.

The Longyan area is a famous old revolutionary base in China. More than 20 years ago, Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu led the Chinese revolutionary movement in this area. Many villages here are revolutionary heroic villages that have been "red and unyielding" for more than 20 years. This area is rich in underground resources such as iron and coal mines. The construction of the Zhangping-Longyan Railway is of great significance for developing the economy of western Fujian and exploiting underground mineral resources.

    福建省将修建漳平到龙岩铁路
    新华社福州25日电　福建省境内漳平到龙岩将修建铁路，铁路勘测设计人员正在搜集设计资料。这条铁路是从鹰厦铁路的漳平车站开始接轧通达龙岩城，全长约七十公里。
    龙岩一带是我国著名的革命老根据地，二十多年前，毛主席和朱总司令曾在这一带地区领导中国革命运动。这里许多乡村都是二十多年“红村不倒”的革命英雄村。这一带地区铁矿、煤矿等地下宝藏很丰富。漳龙铁路的修建，对发展闽西的经济和开发地下矿藏有重大意义。
