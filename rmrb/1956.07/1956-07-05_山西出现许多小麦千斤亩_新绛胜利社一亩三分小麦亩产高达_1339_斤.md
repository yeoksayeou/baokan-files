    Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 3rd. This year, Shanxi Province not only achieved a general bumper harvest of wheat, but also saw many new records of high yields per mu and large-area bumper harvests. More than one hundred agricultural production cooperatives and state-owned farms in fifteen counties including Yongji and Xinjiang achieved an average yield of over 500 jin. Among them, twenty-four agricultural cooperatives and state-owned farms achieved high yields on certain areas, with yields reaching over 1,000 jin per mu. The Victory Agricultural Cooperative in Xinjiang County achieved a yield of 1,339.5 jin per mu on one and a third mu of irrigated land planted with wheat after wheat, setting a new record for high wheat yields in Shanxi Province. The Heping Agricultural Cooperative in Yongji County achieved an average yield of 1,092.5 jin per mu on five mu of irrigated wheat land. The wheat in this cooperative produced many particularly large ears, some with 120 grains, more than double the usual number of grains per ear.

    The Shanxi Provincial Department of Agriculture attaches great importance to the experience of these high-yield wheat fields. A group of agricultural cooperative leading cadres, agricultural technicians, and scientific workers, led by Fan Lüduan, Deputy Director of the Department of Agriculture, and Wu Zao, Director of the Shanxi Provincial Institute of Agricultural Sciences, are observing in the Jinan high-yield area and holding a provincial wheat high-yield conference in Quwo County to summarize experience.

    新华社太原3日电　今年，山西省的小麦不仅普遍得到丰收，而且出现了许多每亩高额丰产和大面积丰产的新纪录。永济、新绛等十五个县的一百多个农业生产合作社、国营农场，平均产量都在五百斤以上。其中有二十四个农业社、国营农场的高额丰产地，每亩产量达到一千斤以上。新绛县胜利农业社一亩三分水地回茬小麦，每亩产量达到1，339斤半，创造了山西省小麦高额丰产的新纪录。永济县和平农业社五亩水地小麦，平均每亩产量达1，092斤半。这个社的麦子中出现很多特别大的麦穗，有的穗结籽一百二十粒，超过一般麦穗一倍左右。
    山西省农业厅非常重视这些小麦的丰产经验，由农业厅副厅长范履端和山西省农业科学研究所所长武藻率领的一批农业社领导干部、农业技术干部和科学工作者，正在晋南丰产区观摩，在曲沃县召开全省小麦丰产会议，总结经验。
