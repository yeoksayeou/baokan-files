Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, July 20th (Xinhua News Agency Reporter Wang Jian reports): Over 60,000 construction workers on the Baoji-Chengdu Railway are actively rectifying various problems along the line to ensure the early opening of this new trunk line.

    The section of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway currently undergoing problem rectification covers more than 360 kilometers from Baoji to Guangyuan. As it passes through a seismic mountain area of magnitude six or seven, the geological structure of this section has been damaged, rock weathering is serious, and there is a high amount of rainfall and groundwater. After the first flood in June, it was found that there were more than 380 relatively serious problem engineering points. Landslides, collapses, debris flows, and mountain torrent scouring all threaten safe traffic in the future.

    More than half of the projects to rectify these problems started successively in mid-July. For the sixteen landslides near tunnels, roadbeds, and a few stations, workers are using drilling rigs or exploratory pits to determine the flow of water in the strata, while also starting to build drainage ditches to drain surface water, "blind ditches" to guide groundwater, and blasting away rocks that affect the balance of the mountain slopes, so that the slopes will be permanently stable in the future. Currently, workers are using rubble to build a large number of drainage ditches at the problem engineering points caused by collapses and debris flows; in areas with severe collapses, "covered trenches" and retaining walls are being built to prevent rocks from collapsing from steep cliffs and to prevent collapsed rocks from blocking the passage of trains. Near bridgeheads prone to mountain torrent scouring, and next to the roadbed along the Jialing River, workers are rushing to build permanent and solid dikes and revetments, and dikes to change the direction of flood scouring.

    Pan Xueqin, Chief Engineer of the Baoji Unified Command Post of the Ministry of Railways, told reporters: The severity of the geological damage caused by earthquakes on this section of the line currently undergoing problem rectification was known in advance. Its geology is better than that of the section from Tianshui south along the Hanshui River, which has already been abandoned. Although we took remedial measures for the predicted problems during the design phase, some situations were gradually discovered during construction, after the mountain slopes were opened up, which were more serious than initially observed. The early floods this year have increased the number of problem engineering points by nearly one-tenth. Pan Xueqin affirmed: These problems can be rectified. Most of the projects are planned to be completed before the official opening of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway, and only a very small number of serious landslides and other problems need to be rectified continuously in the future under the principle of not affecting traffic.

### 争取宝成铁路早日通车营业  六万多筑路职工整治病害工程

    争取宝成铁路早日通车营业
    六万多筑路职工整治病害工程
    据新华社西安20日电　新华社记者汪坚报道：宝成铁路六万多筑路职工正在积极整治沿线各种病害，以便使这条新干线早日通车营业。
    宝成铁路现在整治病害的这段线路，包括从宝鸡到广元360多公里的地段。由于通过六、七级的地震山区，这一段线路的地质构造受到破坏，岩石风化严重，同时降雨量和地下水又很多。今年六月里第一次洪水以后，经查明就有380多处比较严重的病害工点，其中山坡滑动、坍方、流石流泥和山洪冲刷等病害都威胁今后安全通车。
    整治这些病害的工程，在七月中旬就有一大半先后动工。对十六处隧道、路基和少数车站附近的滑坡，职工们一方面用钻机或挖探坑来判明地层里的流水情况；一方面又在开始修排泄地面水的天沟，筑引导地下水的“盲沟”，和崩炸掉影响山坡平衡的石头，使山坡在将来永远稳定。目前，职工们正在坍方和流石流泥造成病害的工点上，用片石修砌大量的排水沟；在坍方严重的地方，修筑“明峒”和挡土墙，使陡崖上的岩石不致再坍落，并且使坍掉下来的石头不再堵住火车通过。在容易被山洪冲刷的桥头附近，和嘉陵江边的路基旁边，职工们正赶修永久性的坚固的护堤、护岸和改变洪水冲刷方向的堤坝。
    铁道部宝鸡统一指挥所总工程师潘学勤对记者说：现在整治病害的这段线路上，地质遭受地震破坏的严重情况是预先知道的。它比已经被放弃的从天水沿汉水南下的那段线路的地质还要好一些。虽然在设计的时候，我们对预知的病害也采取了整治措施，但是在施工的时候开出山坡以后，又逐步发现有些情况比预察的还严重。今年来得过早的洪水又使病害工点增加了近十分之一。潘学勤肯定地说：这些病害都是能够整治好的。大部工点计划在宝成铁路正式通车以前整治完毕，只有极少数严重的滑坡等病害，需要在日后不影响通车的原则下继续整治。
