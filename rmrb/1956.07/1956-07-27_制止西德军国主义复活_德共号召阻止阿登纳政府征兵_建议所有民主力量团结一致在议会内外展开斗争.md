Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, July 26th: According to a DPA dispatch from Dusseldorf: The Executive Committee of the German Communist Party issued a statement on July 24th, demanding that the German Social Democratic Party and all trade unions in West Germany unite their forces with the German Communist Party to simultaneously launch struggles inside and outside parliament to prevent the implementation of the conscription law in West Germany and to curb the development of West German militarism.

The statement said that the conscription law was decided upon at a time when there was already a definite hope of ending the arms race. In this way, the German militarists have proved that they are the most dangerous enemies of the people's security.

The statement called on the West German working class and all the people to take up the responsibility of protecting the youth, and suggested that all democratic forces unite to solve this major task.

The statement called on all those who oppose conscription to support the demand: to prevent the enrollment of 90,000 young people into the army this year, and to delay all measures taken to implement the conscription law until at least after the 1957 Federal Parliament election.

The statement finally emphasized that the West German government should postpone conscription in order to make efforts towards disarmament and easing the situation.

    制止西德军国主义复活
    德共号召阻止阿登纳政府征兵
    建议所有民主力量团结一致在议会内外展开斗争
    新华社柏林26日电　据德意志通讯社杜塞尔多夫消息：德国共产党执行委员会在七月二十四日发表了一项声明，要求德国社会民主党和西德所有的工会把它们的力量同德国共产党联合起来，在议会内外同时展开斗争，以阻止征兵法在西德实施和制止西德军国主义的发展。
    声明说，征兵法是在已经肯定地有希望结束军备竞赛的这样一种形势下决定实行的。这样，德国军国主义者就证明了他们是人民安全的最危险的敌人。
    声明号召西德工人阶级和全体人民把保护青年的责任担负起来，并且建议所有的民主力量团结一致来解决这个重大的任务。
    声明呼吁所有反对征兵的人都支持这样的要求：阻止在今年把九万个青年编入军队，使一切为实施征兵法而采取的措施至少延迟到1957年联邦议院选举以后再执行。
    声明最后强调西德政府应该延缓征兵，以便对裁减军备和缓和局势作出努力。
