Xinhua News Agency, Washington, June 30th: The United States Congress, in a joint session of the Senate and House of Representatives on June 28th, finally passed the appropriations bill for the armed forces and military institutions for the 1957 fiscal year (starting July 1st this year), deciding on a total appropriation of more than 34.6 billion US dollars. This amount is nearly 3 billion US dollars more than the military appropriation for the current fiscal year.

Nearly half of the military appropriations for the next fiscal year is for the Air Force. The Air Force appropriation finally passed by Congress was nearly 1 billion US dollars more than the amount originally proposed by the government. The heated debate over this issue in Congress reflects the significant differences within the US ruling group on military policy.

Democratic members of Congress strongly advocated for increasing Air Force appropriations. They accused the Republican government's military policy of causing the United States to lose its "position of strength."

US government officials have tried their best to defend the amount of Air Force appropriations originally proposed by the government. The arguments presented during the defense were that while emphasizing the Air Force, the balance of the three services should be relatively maintained, and at the same time, the overall military expenditure should not be excessively increased to become a financially unsustainable burden.

During the congressional discussion on military appropriations, the long-standing strategic ideological battle and the scramble for appropriations among the three services within the Pentagon intensified again.

The debate on strategic ideology is intertwined with the contradictions among US monopoly capital. Democratic Senator Symington (former Secretary of the Air Force), who has close ties with the aircraft industry, said that increasing Air Force appropriations is "a plan that any prosperous enterprise would hope for." However, Defense Secretary Wilson, who has close ties with General Motors, which manufactures tanks and trucks, said that those who demand increased Air Force appropriations are "swindlers."

News reports say that the arguments are continuing to unfold even after Congress passed the military appropriations bill.

    美国会对军事拨款争吵激烈
    反映出美统治集团在军事政策上分歧很大
    据新华社30日讯　华盛顿消息：美国国会参众两院六月二十八日举行联席会议，最后通过了1957财政年度（今年七月一日开始）给武装部队和军事机构的拨款法案，决定拨款总数是三百四十六亿余美元。这个数目比本财政年度军事拨款增加了近三十亿美元。
    下一财政年度军事拨款里将近一半是给空军的。国会最后通过的空军拨款比政府原来提出的数目增加了近十亿美元。这个问题在国会讨论中引起的激烈的争吵，反映出美国统治集团在军事政策上存在着不小的分歧。
    民主党议员们在国会里坚决主张增加空军拨款。他们指责共和党政府的军事政策正在使美国丧失“实力优势”。
    美国政府人士曾经竭力为政府原来提出的空军拨款数目辩护。辩护时候提出的论据是：在强调空军的情况下应该相对地维持三军的平衡，同时也要使整个军事开支不过分增加到成为财政方面不能负担的压力。
    在国会讨论军事拨款期间，五角大楼长期存在的三军战略思想和争夺拨款上的论战又白热化出来。
    关于战略思想的争论同美国垄断资本之间的矛盾纠缠在一起。同飞机工业有密切关系的民主党参议员薛明顿（曾任空军部长）说，增加空军拨款是“任何兴隆的企业都希望的计划”。但是，同制造坦克和卡车的通用汽车公司有密切关系的国防部长威尔逊却说，要求增加空军拨款的人都是“骗子”。
    消息说，在国会通过军事拨款法案以后，争吵还在继续展开着。
