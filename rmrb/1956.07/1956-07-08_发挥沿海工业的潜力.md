    Unleash the Potential of Coastal Industry
    Our country is mobilizing all available forces and all positive factors to serve socialism. At this time, it is necessary to raise the issue of unleashing the potential of coastal industry, because our country has a lot of potential in this area. Unleashing this potential will accumulate a lot of capital for the country, provide sufficient technical conditions for inland construction in a timely manner, rapidly cultivate more management cadres and technical talents, and allow the rural areas with the booming cooperative movement to obtain abundant industrial products.
    The distribution of our country's original industry was extremely unreasonable, with most of it concentrated in coastal cities. According to statistics from 1952, the industrial output value of coastal areas accounted for 73% of the total industrial output value. The excessive concentration of industry in coastal areas has made the economic development of various regions in our country very unbalanced. In order to change this unreasonable situation, in the first five-year plan for the development of the national economy in our country, a relatively reasonable arrangement was made for the regional distribution of industry: on the one hand, the scale of inland construction was expanded; at the same time, the original industrial bases were utilized, rebuilt, and expanded, creating many conditions for the construction of new industrial bases. Under the guidance of this correct policy, the industrial face of our country has undergone great changes. Many new enterprises have been built in the vast inland areas. By 1955, the industrial output value of the inland areas had increased by 96% compared to 1952. The production of the original industrial bases in coastal areas has also greatly improved, and a large number of equipment, materials, and personnel have been sent to the new industrial bases. For example, the Anshan Iron and Steel Company, which is currently being expanded, is sending more and more steel to the whole country, and is training a large number of talents for the two new iron and steel bases in Wuhan and Baotou. The large number of products produced by various economic types of industrial enterprises in Shanghai have played an important role in supporting construction in various regions, ensuring market supply, and balancing prices. From the liberation of Shanghai to the first quarter of this year, more than 210,000 people have been transferred from Shanghai to support the inland areas. This is a powerful example.
    However, in the past, there were still some shortcomings in handling the relationship between coastal industry and inland industry, and the huge potential of coastal industrial enterprises has not been fully unleashed. The equipment utilization rate of many enterprises in coastal areas is very low. According to a survey of 40 products in Shanghai, only 10 types of equipment have a utilization rate of over 80%, 20 types have a utilization rate of 40%-80%, 8 types have a utilization rate of 20%-40%, and 2 types have a utilization rate of less than 20%. In coastal areas, many enterprises can double or even multiply their output by adjusting their production equipment or adding some equipment, slightly renovating or expanding. For example, the approximately 8,000 tons of machine parts supplied by Shanghai industry to the Northwest Petroleum Industry this year are far from meeting the needs of the Ministry of Petroleum Industry. However, if more than 10 million yuan of investment can be added to the factories in Shanghai that produce petroleum machine parts, and some equipment can be added or some workshops can be renovated, not only can the needs of the Ministry of Petroleum Industry for 20,000 tons of machine parts be met, but also the necessary reserve force can be provided for the development of the petroleum industry in the Northwest region. The Shanghai Local State-owned Instrument Industry has currently successfully trial-produced a variety of new products such as thermal instruments and chemical instruments. If it is slightly rectified in the future, it can supply a complete series of electromechanical instruments. In other coastal cities, whether it is heavy industry or light industry enterprises, they all have this potential. However, this potential has not been well unleashed in the past, so the development speed of coastal industry has been slower. This is a pity.
    The reason for the above-mentioned shortcomings, as Vice Premier Li Fuchun pointed out at the Third Session of the First National People's Congress, is not only due to many objective reasons, but also to subjective reasons, that is, insufficient attention to coastal industry. In the past, when formulating plans, no active measures were put forward on how to develop coastal industry, or some measures were not comprehensive enough. Therefore, in actual work, various restrictions were intentionally or unintentionally given to the development of coastal industry, which made it impossible for the country to obtain more products, funds, and talents from coastal industrial enterprises.
    Now, the leading organs of various industrial departments and coastal cities have attached importance to the work of fully unleashing the potential of coastal industrial enterprises. In May and June, more than 160 joint state-private heavy industry factories in Shanghai began to carry out reconstruction in order to unleash the potential of these enterprises and produce more products. Because the original industrial production in the coastal areas has a foundation, skilled technical workers, and good cooperative relations between enterprises, it can quickly achieve economic results after necessary reconstruction and expansion. For example, the third workshop of the Shanghai Joint State-Private No. 11 Steel Plant rebuilt the steel heating furnace, which can roll 2,450 tons more steel this year, and the rolling cost can be reduced by 21.9%. The profit recovered this year will be ten times greater than the investment. As another example, the Tianjin Steel Plant only increased an investment of 750,000 yuan this year and added some equipment, and it can increase the production of 20,000 tons of steel within the year. If the party committees and people's committees of various industrial departments and coastal provinces and cities can quickly grasp this work, and if the broad masses of workers in these enterprises can actively explore this potential, we can spend very little investment in coastal industrial enterprises to produce more products, accumulate more funds, and train more talents. It will meet the needs of our country's increasingly expanding industrial construction and the people's increasingly improving living standards in many ways, and further support the industrial construction of the inland areas.
    In order to more effectively tap the potential of coastal industrial enterprises, various industrial departments and coastal provinces and cities should have an overall plan in this regard. When planning, not only should state-owned enterprises be considered, but also the production arrangements of local state-owned and joint state-private enterprises should be considered, so as to comprehensively improve the production of coastal industry. In order to realize this plan, it is necessary to investigate the production situation of each enterprise, specifically find out where the potential lies, and according to the needs of national construction and people's lives, put forward a development plan and the steps and methods to realize the plan. The principle of carrying out this work plan should be: fully utilize the original production foundation and actively develop production. If some enterprises can increase a large number of products or increase urgently needed varieties by slightly expanding or adding some equipment, then, under the premise of striving for supply and demand balance, expansion can also be considered. This is especially true for light industry with rapid capital turnover. Certain light industrial factories and individual or very few large-scale heavy industrial enterprises, if they can obtain raw materials and fuel nearby, can also be set up in coastal areas according to the above principles.
    To unleash the potential of coastal industrial enterprises, on the one hand, active steps and methods should be taken, and on the other hand, the tendency of impatience and rash advance that may occur should be prevented. It is wrong to completely disregard the industrial proportion between coastal and inland areas. This violates the principle of rational distribution of industrial productive forces. Is it okay to disregard the division of labor between enterprises and the balance of products, regardless of the size of the enterprise, regardless of the primary and secondary, regardless of the urgency, and universally require expansion or renovation? It is also not okay, which will disperse the country's funds and make it difficult to guarantee the construction of key projects. And the practice of disliking old equipment and wanting to replace everything with new ones, completely disregarding the country's financial situation, is also wrong, because it is extremely uneconomical. Fully unleashing the potential of coastal enterprises is precisely to further accelerate the construction of new industrial bases in the inland areas, not to weaken the construction of new industrial bases in the inland areas. This point must be made clear. Of course, some problems that need to be solved will also occur in actual work. If they are not solved well, it is likely to affect the rapid progress of this work. The most effective way to solve these problems is to unify and concentrate on major plans by the central government, and to give play to the enthusiasm of local governments on specific issues. In the process of centralization, oppose the practice of taking care of everything, which binds the hands and feet of local governments. When giving play to local enthusiasm, oppose the practice of relying entirely on the central government and completely disregarding the national plan. As long as these two aspects are closely combined, coastal industrial enterprises will be able to exert greater strength in socialist construction.

### 发挥沿海工业的潜力

    发挥沿海工业的潜力
    我国正在调动一切可用的力量、一切积极的因素，为社会主义服务。这个时候提出发挥沿海工业潜力的问题来谈一谈是有必要的，因为我国在这方面存在很多潜力，把这些潜力发挥出来，就会为国家积累大量的资金，及时地给内地建设提供充足的技术条件，迅速地培养更多的管理干部和技术人材，让合作化运动蓬勃发展着的农村得到丰富的工业品。
    我国原有工业的分布是极不合理的，大部分都集中在沿海各城市。根据1952年的统计，沿海地区的工业产值占工业总产值73％。工业过分集中于沿海地区，使我国各地区间经济发展很不平衡。为了改变这种不合理的状况，在我国发展国民经济的第一个五年计划中，对工业的地区分布作了比较合理的部署：一方面扩大了内地建设的规模；同时，也利用、改建和扩建了原有的工业基地，给建设新工业基地创造了许多条件。在这个正确的方针指导下，我国的工业面貌有了很大的改变。在广大内地建设了许多新的企业。到1955年，内地的工业产值比1952年增加了96％。沿海地区原有的工业基地的生产也大大提高了，向新的工业基地输送了大批的设备、材料和人员。例如，正在扩建中的鞍山钢铁公司，向全国输送的钢材愈来愈多，并且为武汉、包头两个新钢铁基地培养着大批的人材。上海市各种经济类型的工业企业，生产出的大批产品对支援各地建设、保证市场供应、平衡物价起了重要的作用。从上海解放到今年第一季度，由上海市调出支援内地的人员就有二十一万多人。这是有力的例证。
    但是，过去在处理沿海工业和内地工业之间的关系上，也还存在一些缺点，沿海工业企业中的巨大潜力还没有充分发挥出来。沿海地区不少企业的设备利用率很低。根据上海市对四十种产品的调查，设备利用率达到80％以上的只有十种、40％—80％的有二十种、20％—40％的有八种、20％以下的两种。沿海地区有许多企业只要调整一下生产设备或增添一些设备、稍加改建或扩建就能增加一倍甚至几倍的产量。例如，上海市工业今年供应西北石油工业的约八千吨机器配件，远不能满足石油工业部的需要。但如果能对上海市生产石油机器配件的工厂增加一千多万元投资，增加一些设备或改建某些车间，不但可以满足石油工业部两万吨机器配件的需要，还可以为发展西北地区石油工业提供必要的后备力量。上海地方国营仪表工业，目前已试制成功了多种热工仪表、化工仪表等新产品，今后如果稍加整顿，就可以供应整系列的机电仪表。在沿海其他城市中，不管是重工业还是轻工业的企业也都有这种潜力。但是，这些潜力过去没有很好发挥出来，以致沿海工业的发展速度慢了一些。这是很可惜的。
    所以发生上述缺点，正如李富春副总理在第一届全国人民代表大会第三次会议上所指出的那样，不仅客观的原因很多，而且还有主观的原因，那就是对于沿海工业重视不够。过去订计划的时候对于如何发展沿海的工业没有提出积极的措施，或者有些措施也不全面。因而在实际工作当中，就有意或无意地对沿海工业的发展给予各种限制，这就使得国家没有能够从沿海工业企业中得到更多的产品、资金和人材。
    现在，各工业部门、各沿海城市的领导机关已重视了充分发挥沿海工业企业潜力的工作。上海市在五、六月份，就有一百六十多个公私合营的重工业工厂开始进行改建，以便发挥这些企业的潜力，生产更多的产品。由于沿海原有工业生产有基础、有熟练的技术工人、企业间有很好的协作关系，所以在进行必要的改建扩建以后就能迅速收到经济成效。例如，上海公私合营第十一钢厂第三车间改建了烘钢炉，今年可多轧制2，450吨钢材，轧制成本可降低21.9％，只今年收回的利润将比投资大十倍。再以天津钢厂为例，今年仅增加七十五万元投资，添了部分设备，年内就可增产两万吨钢。如果各工业部门、沿海各省、市的党委和人民委员会，都能够很快地抓紧进行这一工作，如果这些企业中的广大职工能够积极发掘这方面的潜力，我们就可以在沿海工业企业中花很少的投资，生产更多的产品，积累更多的资金，培养更多的人材，会在许多方面满足我国规模日益扩大的工业建设和日益提高的人民生活的需要，进一步支援内地的工业建设。
    为了更有效地发掘沿海工业的潜力，各工业部门和沿海各省、市在这方面要有个通盘的规划。在规划的时候，不但要考虑到国营企业，还要考虑到地方国营、公私合营企业的生产安排，这才能全面地提高沿海工业的生产。为了使这种规划能够实现，就要对各企业的生产情况进行调查，具体地找出潜力所在，根据国家建设和人民生活的需要，提出发展的计划和实现计划的步骤、方法。进行这个工作规划的原则应该是：充分利用原有的生产基础，积极发展生产。如果某些企业只要稍加扩建或增添部分设备，就能增加大量产品或增加迫切需要的品种，那末，在力求供销平衡的前提下，也可以考虑进行扩建。特别是资金周转很快的轻工业更应该这样。某些轻工业工厂以及个别的或极少数的大型重工业企业，如果能够就近取得原料和燃料，同样可以根据上述原则设在沿海地区。
    要发挥沿海工业企业的潜力，一方面要采取积极的步骤和方法，同时也要防止可能发生的急躁冒进的偏向。完全不照顾沿海和内地的工业比例是不对的，这是违反合理分布工业生产力的原则的。不考虑企业间的分工和产品的平衡，不分大小企业、不分主次、不分缓急，一律要求扩建或改建行不行呢？也是不行的，这会分散国家的资金，难于保证重点工程的建设。而那种讨厌旧设备，一切都要换新的，完全不照顾国家的资金状况的做法，同样是错误的，因为这是极不经济的。充分发挥沿海企业的潜力，正是为了进一步加快内地新工业基地的建设，而不是削弱内地新工业基地的建设，这一点必须明确。当然，在实际工作中还会发生一些需要解决的问题，如果解决的不好，很可能影响这一工作不能很快地进行。解决这些问题最有效的办法，是在大的计划上由中央统一集中，在具体的问题上发挥地方的积极性。在集中过程中，反对包办一切以致捆住地方手脚的做法。在发挥地方积极性的时候，反对一切都依赖中央和完全不照顾国家计划的做法。只要这两方面密切地结合起来，就能够使沿海工业企业在社会主义建设中发挥更大的力量。
