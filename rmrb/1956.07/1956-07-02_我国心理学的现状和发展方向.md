    The science of psychology in our country is a relatively backward discipline, and it is far from meeting the needs of national construction. Before liberation, almost all of psychology in our country was peddled from capitalist countries, with very little creation from Chinese psychology workers themselves; even if there was some research work, it was carried out along the path of psychology in capitalist countries. Therefore, not only was the foundation of Chinese psychology extremely weak before liberation, but it also had as many serious shortcomings as psychology in capitalist countries.

    The Fundamental Change in the State of Psychological Science in Our Country

    Since liberation, the situation of psychological science in our country has undergone fundamental changes. The first was to learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and carry out basic professional transformation. Under the Party's call to learn from the Soviet Union, general psychology workers actively studied Marxist-Leninist theory, Pavlovian doctrine, and the achievements of Soviet psychologists, recognizing that psychology must be transformed and researched on the basis of Marxist-Leninism and Pavlovian doctrine. Moreover, considerable achievements have been made in learning and professional transformation.

    The Party and the People's Government have also given appropriate attention to psychology. The Chinese Academy of Sciences established a psychology research office as soon as it was founded. During the adjustment of departments in colleges and universities, the original psychology departments were either retained or strengthened to become psychology majors. In higher normal colleges, the teaching of psychology has been universally strengthened, and psychology teaching and research groups have been established. The Party and the People's Government also actively encouraged and supported the professional transformation of the Chinese psychology community. In the summer of 1953, the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Central Ministry of Health jointly held a "Pavlovian Doctrine Study Conference," allowing many psychology workers to participate, which played a certain role in the Chinese psychology community's study of Pavlovian doctrine. The academic activities of the Chinese psychology community, such as the holding of meetings and the publication of journals by the Chinese Psychological Society, have received the support and encouragement of the Party and the People's Government. Many psychology workers have been completely exempted from teaching tasks for a longer period of time with the consent of their superiors in order to devote themselves to preparing lessons or pursuing advanced studies. Now, the Chinese Academy of Sciences has decided to expand the original psychology research office into an institute. The Ministry of Higher Education and the Ministry of Education have both begun to consider setting up psychology research institutions in individual schools with suitable conditions, and have decided to increase the enrollment quota for psychology majors and expand the training of psychology teachers. All of this shows that the Party and the People's Government are further promoting the development of psychological science in China so that this science can also better serve the country's construction.

    The founding of New China has created favorable conditions for the rebirth of psychology in our country. However, due to the weak original foundation and many shortcomings, the rebirth and growth of psychology in our country still requires a long time. At present, although the transformation work of psychology has a certain foundation, there is still much that needs to be done. For example, although we have grasped some of the ways to learn from the Soviet Union, we still do not know enough about the details of psychology in the Soviet Union. We know almost nothing about the achievements of other People's Democratic countries in psychology. We have not paid attention to the development of psychology in capitalist countries for many years. As for scientific research work guided by Marxist-Leninist theory and Pavlovian doctrine, the Psychology Research Office of the Chinese Academy of Sciences has only started some exploratory work and still needs to gradually transition to more creative work. In colleges and universities, this kind of psychological research work has either just begun, or has just started, or has not yet started. However, judging from the achievements of some of the research work that has just started or has not been long in progress, this research work can be optimistic because it can be seen from these initial achievements that Chinese psychology workers generally have sufficient research ability. As long as we continue, the scientific research of Chinese psychology will definitely be quickly developed and improved.

    In short, now is the stage for psychology in our country to shift from professional transformation to active development. During this period, it is very necessary to consider how to promote the development of psychology in our country.

    Psychology is a basic science. Simply put, it is an important science that studies human traits and their development. In the evolution of the objective world, the emergence of humans is a very big thing. Humans have many outstanding traits. We must conduct scientific research on human traits. Psychologists of the declining bourgeoisie have attempted to give various distorted and unscientific explanations of human traits and their development in order to serve the exploitative interests of the bourgeoisie. This obvious fact proves in turn how necessary it is to conduct scientific research on human traits and their development in order to gain a scientific understanding for socialist construction.

    But how to promote the development of psychological science in our country? First of all, we must grasp the general direction. The development of psychological science in our country must closely follow the path indicated by Marxist-Leninist theory and Pavlovian doctrine. Our goal is to establish a dialectical materialist scientific psychology. Our purpose is to be able to competently serve socialist construction and future communist construction. In our efforts, we should strive to establish close ties and cooperation with Soviet psychologists and psychologists from other People's Democratic countries.

    Strengthen Theoretical Learning and Professional Learning
    Carry Out Scientific Research Work

    In order to accomplish this task, psychology workers in our country must strengthen their learning. We have only a preliminary grasp of Marxist-Leninist theory and Pavlovian doctrine, and we still need to continue to study in conjunction with professional research and practice in order to achieve mastery. In our study, we must pay special attention to avoiding falling into the quagmire of dogmatism. We also only know some of the achievements of Soviet psychologists, and we still need to further study them in more detail and comprehensively. We must try to know and obtain as soon as possible what research Soviet and People's Democratic psychologists are doing, what direction they are taking, what methods they are using, what papers they are publishing, and what reference materials they have. For psychology in capitalist countries, we must also pay attention to absorbing all the desirable components while criticizing and discarding the unscientific components. In addition, we also need to supplement some basic scientific knowledge at any time in combination with our specific circumstances. Psychology is a science that studies a highly complex object and requires the help of several other scientific knowledge, therefore, the basic scientific knowledge of psychologists must not be too narrow.

    Secondly, we must vigorously carry out scientific research work, which is the main link in promoting the development of psychology. However, since psychology workers in our country generally still need more time to study, and many still have teaching tasks, we cannot demand too much or too hastily for their research work. It is more appropriate to let them carry out research work while strengthening their learning. In addition, some people tend to engage in empty theoretical thinking while ignoring practical research work, and some people tend to bury themselves in laboratory observation or data collection work while ignoring theoretical exploration. These are also tendencies that must be overcome. We should closely combine perceptual knowledge with rational knowledge. We must especially recognize that psychology is a science in the true sense of the word, requiring practical work, not a place for speculation out of thin air.

    At the same time, in carrying out scientific research work, we must pay special attention to the issue of linking with practice. The development of all sciences cannot but be linked with practice, and psychology is no exception. It cannot be denied that the tendency to ignore linking with practice still exists among psychology workers in our country. Therefore, it is necessary to give special emphasis to the point of linking with practice. However, due to the shortcomings that its history has created for it, there are still many difficulties in this regard. For example, the psychology taught in normal colleges cannot meet the future teaching needs of students. This difficulty in linking with practice is a major weakness of psychology in our country at present, and it must be remedied in future development. However, solving the problem of the connection between psychology and practice cannot be achieved solely by the efforts of psychology workers. That is to say, if we want to strengthen the connection between psychology and practice so that it can serve practice, then the relevant business departments must give appropriate attention and support. This is the same as the internship of college students must obtain the attention and support of the relevant business departments. In addition, although the connection between psychological science and practice is mainly in education, psychological science also has many connections with labor and health care practice. The current situation is that, in addition to the education department, other relevant business departments obviously do not pay enough attention to psychology work. This phenomenon must be eliminated. On the other hand, psychology workers must of course actively strive for the support of relevant business departments. Psychology is of great help to literary and artistic work, and it also provides some help for national defense construction. Therefore, the connection between psychology and these aspects needs to be developed even more. We can say with certainty that if psychology cannot be linked to practice in the field of literature and art, then it proves that the development of psychology is not mature enough. However, Chinese psychology workers lack experience in linking with practice, except in the field of education. We must learn more from the Soviet Union.

    Expand the Ranks of Psychological Scientists
    Training cadres, expanding the ranks of scientific workers, and allocating cadres to achieve the most rational use are key issues in the development of science. Psychology is also the same. The basic situation now is that the ranks of psychology workers in our country are too small, and even fewer have received professional training. Even those who have received professional training, their professional training may not be sufficient. Therefore, we must expand the ranks of psychology workers, gradually increase the number of people who have received professional training, and gradually supplement those who have not received sufficient professional training. The psychology refresher courses or research classes run by normal universities are mainly for the latter purpose. This is very necessary, but this work needs to be further improved. At the same time, psychology majors in colleges and universities must expand enrollment and strengthen the power to train psychology professionals. The practice of putting psychology majors together with philosophy majors in colleges and universities (such as Peking University) is an old practice that is no longer in line with current requirements, and even less in line with future requirements. Putting psychology majors together with biology majors (such as Nanjing University) is even more inappropriate. Psychology should become a department or an independent major. Only in this way can we better train talents and carry out scientific research. Regarding the number of cadres to be trained, it is hoped that the Ministry of Higher Education and the Ministry of Education will study in detail and make decisions based on the actual situation in order to adapt to the needs of the development of construction. In addition, the current psychology professional teaching plan should be revised and improved as soon as possible at an appropriate time in conjunction with the development of the march towards science.

    Regarding the issue of giving full play to the strength of psychology cadres in our country, it is necessary to explain in particular. The first is the necessary allocation of psychology cadres. There are not many experienced psychology cadres in our country. However, some of these cadres spend most of their time doing other work, such as school administrative work or other administrative work; and some cadres, although doing work related to their profession, cannot give full play to their strengths. All of this is very unreasonable and should be resolved through allocation. Those who are suitable for specializing in scientific research work should be allowed to give full play to their strength in scientific research work. Finally, we must emphasize the issue of unity. The psychology community in our country before liberation lacked unity. Now, this situation has basically improved. The national psychology community must work together to strengthen unity in order to achieve full mutual assistance and cooperation in the march towards science to exert a strong force. If this point and the appropriate allocation of cadres cannot be achieved, then there are problems with the realization of the development vision plan for psychology in our country.

    Regarding research institutions, in addition to those that have been decided to be expanded and are being prepared to be established, the first thing to consider is to establish research institutions for labor psychology and medical psychology in the near future.

    Although psychology is not a key science for development, it also has considerable importance that cannot be ignored. Its importance will inevitably increase due to the progress of socialist construction and its own gradual development. We should give further necessary attention to this weak science.

    我国心理学的现状和发展方向
    中国心理学会理事长　潘菽
    我国的心理科学是比较落后的一门学科，它是远远不能满足国家建设的需要的。在解放前，我国的心理学几乎全部都是从资本主义国家中贩卖过来的，其中很少中国心理学工作者自己的创造；即使有一部分研究工作，也是在资本主义国家心理学的途径上进行的。因此，解放前的中国心理学不仅基础十分薄弱，而且具有同资本主义国家心理学同样多的严重缺点。
    我国心理科学状况的根本变化
    解放以来，我国心理科学的情况起了根本的变化。首先是学习了苏联的先进经验，进行了基本上的业务改造。在党的向苏联学习的号召之下，一般心理学工作者都积极地学习了马克思列宁主义理论、巴甫洛夫学说和苏联心理学者的成就，认识到了心理学必须在马克思列宁主义和巴甫洛夫学说的基础上进行改造和研究。并且，已在学习和业务改造中取得不少成绩。
    党和人民政府对于心理学也给予了适当的重视。中国科学院在一成立的时候就设立了心理研究室。在高等学校院系调整的时候，原有的心理系或则保留，或则加强而成为心理专业。在高等师范院校中，普遍加强了心理学的教学工作，设置了心理学教研组。党和人民政府还对中国心理学界的业务改造积极鼓励和支持。1953年夏天，中国科学院和中央卫生部联合举办了一个“巴甫洛夫学说学习会”，让许多心理学工作者也能参加，这对中国心理学界的学习巴甫洛夫学说是起了一定作用的。中国心理学界的学术活动，例如中国心理学会的举行会议和出版会刊，都得到了党和人民政府的支持和鼓励。许多心理学工作者为了要专力从事备课或进修，都得到了上级领导的同意而完全免除了一个较长时间的教学任务。现在，中国科学院已决定把原有的心理研究室扩建成所。高等教育部和教育部都已开始考虑在有条件的个别学校中设置心理学的研究机构，并且决定增加心理专业的招生名额，扩大培养心理学的师资。这都说明党和人民政府正在进一步促进心理科学在中国的发展，使这门科学也能很好地为国家的建设服务。
    新中国的成立为我国心理学的新生创造了有利条件。但是，究竟由于原来的基础薄弱，缺点很多，我国心理学的新生和成长还需较长的时间。目前，心理学的改造工作虽已有了一定的基础，但是有待于努力的部分还很多。例如学习苏联，虽然掌握了一些门径，但是对于苏联心理学方面的详细情况还了解得很不够。对于其他人民民主国家在心理学方面的成就更几乎全无所知。对于资本主义国家心理学的发展情况已有许多年没有予以注意。至于以马克思列宁主义理论和巴甫洛夫学说为指导的科学研究工作，中国科学院心理研究室只开始了一些试探性的工作，还有待于逐步转入具有较多创造性的工作。在高等学校内，这种心理学的研究工作或则开始不久，或则刚开始，或则还没有开始。但是，从刚开始或开始不久的一部分研究工作的成绩来看，这种研究工作是可以令人乐观的，因为从这些初步的成绩中可以看到中国心理学工作者一般都是具有足够的钻研能力的。只要继续下去，中国心理学的科学研究一定将会很快地得到开展和提高。
    总之，现在是我国心理科学从业务改造转向于积极发展的阶段。在这个时期内，考虑一下如何推动我国心理科学的发展是很有必要的。
    心理学是一门基础科学。简单地说，它是一门研究人的特质及其发展的重要科学。在客观世界的演化过程中，到了人的出现，这是一件很大的事情。人是具有许多突出的特质的。我们对于人的特质必须进行科学研究。没落中的资产阶级的心理学者都企图对于人的特质及其发展进行种种歪曲的反科学的说明，以求为资产阶级的剥削利益服务。这个昭彰的事实就反过来可以证明，为了社会主义的建设，对于人的特质及其发展进行科学研究以获得科学的了解是如何必要了。
    但是，怎样推动我国心理科学的发展呢？首先要掌握总的方向。我国心理科学的发展必须紧紧地遵循着马克思列宁主义理论和巴甫洛夫学说所指示的道路。我们的目标是要建立辩证唯物主义的科学心理学。我们的目的是要能胜任地为社会主义建设和将来的共产主义建设服务。在我们的努力过程中，应该争取同苏联心理学者和其他人民民主国家的心理学者取得密切的联系和合作。
    加强理论学习和业务学习
    开展科学研究工作
    为了要完成这个任务，我国的心理学工作者必须加强学习。我们对于马克思列宁主义理论和巴甫洛夫学说还只是初步掌握，我们还须要结合着业务的钻研和实践继续学习以求达到精通。我们在学习中特别要注意避免陷入教条主义的泥坑。对于苏联心理学者的成就，我们也只是初步知道了一些，还有待于进一步作比较详细和全面的学习。苏联和人民民主国家的心理学者在做什么研究，方向如何，用什么方法，发表哪些论著，有哪些参考资料，我们都要设法及时知道，及早获得。对于资本主义国家的心理学，我们也要注意吸收其中一切可取的成分而同时批判抛弃其中的反科学成分。此外，我们还需要结合各人的具体情况随时补充一些基础科学的知识。心理学是研究一种高度复杂的对象的科学，需要好几种其他科学知识的帮助，因此，心理学者的基础科学知识决不能太狭。
    其次，要大力开展科学研究工作，这是推动心理学的发展的主要环节。但是，由于我国一般心理学工作者还需要有较多时间进行学习，很多人还有教学任务，所以对于他们的研究工作一时还不能要求过高或过急。让他们一边开展研究工作，一边加强学习，这是比较适当的办法。此外，有些人偏于作空泛的理论思考而忽视切实的钻研工作，有些人偏于埋头在实验室的观察或收集材料的工作而忽视理论的探讨，这也都是必须克服的偏向。我们应该把感性认识同理性认识密切结合起来。我们特别要认识，心理学是一门名符其实的科学，需要切切实实的工作，而不是一个凭空思辨的场所。
    同时，在开展科学研究工作中，还要特别注意联系实践这个问题。一切科学的发展都不能不联系实践，心理科学也不例外。不能否认，目前在我国心理学工作者中间忽视联系实践的倾向还是存在的。因此，有必要对于联系实践这一点特别予以强调。但是，由于它的历史给它造成的缺点，在这方面现在还有很多困难。例如，师范院校中教的心理学还不能满足学生将来教学需要。这种在联系实践上的困难是目前我国心理学的一个主要弱点，必须在今后的发展中予以补救。但是，解决心理学同实践联系这个问题，还决不能单靠心理学工作者的一方面的努力。这就是说，如要加强心理学同实践的联系使它能为实践服务，那就一定要由有关业务部门给以适当的重视和支持。这同高等学校学生的实习必须取得有关业务部门的重视和支持是一样的。此外，心理科学同实践的联系固然主要是在教育方面，但是心理科学同劳动和保健的实践也有不少的联系。现在的情况是，除了教育部门以外，其他有关的业务部门对于心理学工作显然还不够注意。这种现象是必须消除的。另一方面，心理学工作者当然也要积极争取有关业务部门的支持。心理学对于文艺工作有很大帮助，对于国防建设也有一定帮助。因此，心理学同这些方面的联系更有待于发展。我们可以肯定地说，心理学如还不能联系文艺方面的实践，那就证明心理学的发展还不够成熟。但是，我国心理学工作者联系实践的经验，除了在教育方面外，是很缺乏的。我们必须多多向苏联学习。
    扩大心理科学工作者的队伍
    培养干部，扩大科学工作者的队伍，并且调配干部，以求达到最合理的使用，这是发展科学的关键性问题。心理学也是如此。现在的基本情况是，我国心理学工作者的队伍太小，其中受过专业训练的人更少。就是那些受过专业训练的人，他们所受的专业训练也未必是足够的。因此，我们就要扩大心理学工作者的队伍，并使受过专业训练的人逐渐多起来，使专业训练不够的人逐渐补足起来。现在师范大学办的心理学进修班或研究班主要就是为了后一个目的。这是很必要的，但是这个工作还要进一步地提高。同时，高等学校中的心理学专业必须扩大招生，增强培养心理学专业人材的力量。现在高等学校中的心理学专业同哲学专业摆在一起（如北京大学），这是一个旧的做法，已不合于现在的要求，更不合于今后的要求。把心理学专业同生物学专业摆在一起（如南京大学），这更是不适宜的。心理学应该自成为一个系或成为一个独立的专业。只有这样，才能更好地培养人材，开展科学研究。关于培养干部的数量，希望高等教育部和教育部根据实际情况加以详细研究并且作出决定，以求适应建设事业发展的需要。另外，现在的心理学专业教学计划应该结合向科学进军的发展情况，在适当时期内及早加以修订以求完善。
    关于发挥我国心理学干部的力量的问题，需要特别说明一下。首先是关于心理学干部的必要调配。我国有经验的心理学干部是不多的。但是其中还有一些干部在用大部分时间干别的工作，如学校的行政工作或其他的行政工作；还有一些干部虽然在做同业务有关的工作，却并不能充分发挥所长。这都是很不合理的，应该通过调配予以解决。其中有适宜于专门做科学研究工作的，就应该让他们在科学研究工作方面充分发挥力量。最后，我们还要强调一下团结的问题，我国解放前的心理学界是缺乏团结的。现在，这种情况已基本上改善了。全国心理学界还必须共同努力，加强团结，以求在向科学进军中取得充分的互助合作以发挥强大的力量。假如这一点和干部的适当调配不能做到，那末我国心理科学要实现它的发展远景规划是有问题的。
    关于研究机构，除了已决定要扩大的和准备要建立的以外，首先要考虑在不久的时间内设立劳动心理学和医学心理学的研究机构。
    心理学虽然不是一门重点发展的科学，但是也有不可忽视的相当广泛的重要性。它的重要性还必将由于社会主义建设的前进以及它自己的逐渐发展而增加。我们对于这门薄弱的科学应该进一步地予以必要的重视。
