Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, July 8th. These days, Shanghai has been experiencing sweltering weather. The Railway Administration has opened a "Seaside Night Train" from the 7th onwards, specifically to transport citizens to Wusongkou for cooler air.

On the evening of the 7th, a little after 7 o'clock, more than two hundred workers, students, and mothers with children, took the first night train to the seaside park. Here, people leaned on the railings to enjoy the night view of the water, or strolled and chatted along the riverbank. Workers from a pharmaceutical factory even brought musical instruments and held a gathering. A camping team of more than twenty students pitched tents on the lawn and spent a pleasant weekend night here.

A few days ago, the Municipal Ferry Company also started offering "Huangpu River Night Cruises." Every night, more than 1,500 people take two ships to enjoy the sights along the Huangpu River to their hearts' content.

    海滨夜游列车
    新华社上海8日电　这几天来，上海天气酷热，铁路管理局从七日起开放了“海滨夜游列车”，专门载送市民到吴淞口乘凉。
    七日傍晚七点多钟，二百多名工人、学生，还有带着孩子的母亲们，乘第一趟夜游列车到了海滨公园。在这里，人们依傍栏杆远眺水上夜景，或在江边散步、谈笑。一家制药工厂的工人，还带来乐器，举行了联欢。二十多个学生组成的一个露营队，在草坪上支起帐篷，在这里度过一个愉快的周末之夜。
    几天以前，市轮渡公司也开始举办了“浦江夜游”，每晚有一千五百多人乘着两艘轮船，在黄浦江上尽情游览。
