    Do Not Illegally Poach Workers

    On March 25th, Li Yaowu and Lu Min'an, staff members of the Gansu Provincial Company of the China Timber Company, secretly poached workers when they came to our lumberyard to allocate timber. They said to Zhang Weiqiu and others: "You earn less money here. You can earn five or six yuan a day if you come to our place. If you want to go, I will give you a letter of introduction." They also said to the workers in the canteen: "The gaoliang rice you eat here is used to feed horses in our place. We eat rice and white flour." Under their encouragement, twenty-eight workers from our lumberyard left without permission to go to the Gansu Provincial Timber Company in Lanzhou in April. Now there are still fourteen workers who want to resign and go there. Some workers have sold their belongings to raise travel expenses, which has caused them financial difficulties. Some workers do not come to work and only ask to leave.

    We believe that this kind of illegal poaching of workers is wrong. We hope that the Gansu Provincial Timber Company will quickly send our lumberyard's workers back.

    不要违法私拉工人
    三月二十五日，中国木材公司甘肃省公司的工作人员李耀武、鲁民安，到我们贮木场调拨木材时，暗中拉工人跳场。他们对张维秋等说：“你们在这里挣的钱少，到我们那里一天能挣五、六元钱，要去的话，我给你们开介绍信。”他们还在食堂里向工人说：“你们吃的高粮米在我们那里都是喂马的，我们吃的都是大米、白面。”在他们的鼓动下，我们贮木场有二十八名工人，在四月份私自离场去兰州甘肃省木材公司了，现在还有十四名工人要求离职前去。有的工人为了筹办路费，把家里的东西都卖掉了，以致生活上发生困难。还有的工人不出勤，一味要求退场。
    我们认为这种私拉工人的行为是不对的。希望甘肃省木材公司迅速把我们场的工人送回来。
