    Anshan Iron and Steel's New Construction Projects Begin on a Large Scale
    Four State-of-the-Art Coke Ovens

    The four largest and most modern coke ovens in our country have begun construction on a wide, open site north of the Anshan Iron and Steel Chemical Plant.

    Currently, underground work for the foundation of the new No. 1 and No. 4 coke ovens is exceptionally busy. Powerful pile drivers roar all day long, driving concrete piles more than ten meters long into the ground. In a nearly three-li-long trench, pipeline workers are laying sections of underground water pipes several armfuls thick. Dump trucks carrying concrete are speeding back and forth, and the giant recovery workshop project, which recovers various chemical products from coal gas, has already begun pouring its foundation.

    These four giant, new-style coke ovens were designed by a group of chemical designers newly grown in Anshan under the guidance of Soviet experts. Once completed, they can shorten the coking time by about two hours compared to Anshan Iron and Steel's existing coke ovens. The main new equipment needed to build these new coke ovens is also supplied by domestic machinery manufacturing plants.

    A New Open-Pit Iron Mine

    At the construction site of the Dong Anshan open-pit iron mine, more than ten li south of Anshan city, miners are accelerating the leveling of its mountain.

    This giant open-pit iron mine, which began construction in May, will become one of Anshan Iron and Steel's largest mines. The builders of this mine have decided to cut off a mountain weighing more than 900,000 tons by the end of this year. According to the original plan, this project would take a year and a half.

    Large-Scale Sintering Plant

    Anshan Iron and Steel is building a large-scale new sintering plant. After eight months of round-the-clock labor by the builders, the civil engineering of this plant is about to be completed, and the mechanical installation has already begun.

    Anshan Iron and Steel's builders are equipping this plant with the most advanced technology to eliminate strenuous labor throughout the entire process, from raw material entry to finished product output. New equipment such as air showers are installed in workshops with high temperatures and dust, so that workers can constantly breathe fresh air. Harmful gases generated during the production process are discharged into the sky through newly completed chimneys that are one hundred meters high.

    New Flotation Iron Ore Workshop

    On a hill south of the Anshan Iron and Steel Sintering Plant, a new workshop—China's first flotation workshop for ferrous metal ore—is growing in the hands of construction workers. The workshop is already piled high with mechanical equipment such as flotation machines and ball mills, ready for installation.

    Flotation mainly uses chemical reagents such as soybean oil fatty acids and soda ash to separate iron and impurities in lean iron ore, so as to transform lean iron ore with an original iron content of about 30% into refined iron ore with an iron content of about 58%. Because flotation can directly beneficiate hematite, it can reduce a reduction process compared to magnetic separation. According to tests by the Institute of Metallurgy and Ceramics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, flotation can also reduce the cost by two yuan per ton of ore selected compared to magnetic separation.

    Nearly 300 Li of Railway

    After a 45-day crash program, Anshan's railway construction workers completed the construction of 11 railways for the Anshan Iron and Steel Ironmaking Plant on the 10th. These railways will be used to transport molten iron, slag, and ironmaking raw materials for the No. 9 blast furnace, which will soon be put into production.

    In order to meet the needs of production and construction, the scale of new and rebuilt railways at Anshan Iron and Steel this year is larger than in any previous year. The total length of railways to be laid by the railway construction workers this year will be nearly 300 li. The construction of these railways requires the completion of one million cubic meters of earthwork, and more than 200 li of power lines must be erected for electric locomotives.

    Now, the large amount of coking coal and ore needed by Anshan Iron and Steel can be directly transported into the factory area through a newly built giant station. In Dong Anshan, electric locomotives have also begun to transport iron ore from the top of the mountain to the ore dressing plant day and night along a newly repaired winding mountain railway. In the rich Dashiqiao magnesite mining area, a railway project of about 40 li in length is being laid. The construction of the railway for the new four giant coke ovens has also begun.

    鞍钢新的建设工程大规模动工
    四座最新式的炼焦炉
    我国最大最新式的四座炼焦炉，已经在鞍钢化工总厂北面的一片宽旷的场地上开始建设。
    目前，新一、四号炼焦炉基础工程的地下作业格外繁忙。威力强大的打桩机，整天鸣叫着，把一根根十多公尺长的混凝土桩击入地层。在一条近三里长的地沟里，管道工人正在敷设着一节节有好几抱粗的地下水道管。运送混凝土的翻斗汽车，来往疾驰，从煤气里回收各种化学品的巨型回收车间工程，已经开始浇灌基础。
    这四座巨型新式炼焦炉，是在苏联专家指导下由鞍山新成长起来的一批化工设计师设计出来的。建成以后，它们每炼好一次焦炭的时间可以比鞍钢现有的炼焦炉缩短两小时左右。建设这些新炼焦炉所需要的主要新式设备，也都是由国内各机械制造厂供应的。
    一个新的露天铁矿
    在鞍山市区南面十多里路的东鞍山露天铁矿区工地上，矿工们正在加速削平它的山头。
    这座在五月份开始建设的巨型的露天铁矿，将成为鞍钢最大的矿山之一。这座矿山的建设者决定在今年年底，要砍掉一个九十多万吨重的山头。按照原来规定，这个工程要做一年半时间。
    规模巨大的烧结厂
    鞍钢正在建设一个规模巨大的新烧结厂。经过建设者八个月的日夜劳动，这座工厂的土木建筑工程就要结束，机械安装已经开始。
    鞍钢的建设者正在以最先进的技术把这座工厂装备起来，使它从原料入厂到成品出厂的过程中，全部消除费力的劳动。在有高温和有灰尘的车间里，都设有空气淋浴等新式设备，使工人能经常呼吸到新鲜的空气。生产过程中产生的有害气体，都由刚完工的高达一百公尺的烟囱排除到天空。
    浮选铁矿的新车间
    在鞍钢烧结总厂南面的山岗上，一个新的车间——我国第一个黑色金属矿的浮选车间，正在建筑工人手中成长起来，车间附近已经堆满了浮选机、球磨机等机械设备，就要开始安装了。
    浮选，主要是用豆油脂肪酸和曹达灰等化学药品，使贫铁矿中的铁和杂质分离，以便把原来含铁量30％左右的贫铁矿，变成含铁58％左右的精铁矿。因为浮选能够直接选赤铁矿，比用磁选法可以减少一道还原的工序。据中国科学院冶金陶瓷研究所试验证明，每选一吨矿石，浮选还能比磁选降低成本两元。
    近三百里长的铁路
    鞍山的铁路建筑工人们经过四十五天的突击，在十日完成了鞍钢炼铁厂十一条铁路的建设任务。这些铁路是不久就要投入生产的九号高炉用来运送铁水、铁渣和炼铁原料的。
    为了满足生产建设的需要，鞍钢今年新建和改建铁路的规模比以往任何一年都大。筑路工人们今年内要铺设的铁路总长度将近三百里。建设这些铁路要完成一百万公方的土方，并且还要给电机火车架设二百多里长的摩电线路。
    现在，鞍钢需要的大量炼焦煤和矿石，已经可以通过一个新建成的巨型车站直接运进厂区。在东鞍山，电机火车也开始沿着一条新修复起来的盘山铁路，日夜不停地从山顶向选矿厂运送着铁矿石。在富饶的大石桥镁矿区，一项约四十里长的铁路工程正在敷设铁轨。为新建的四座巨型炼焦炉建设的铁路，也开始施工了。　（据新华社讯）
