The fact that the Wu Dan family of seven all work at the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant has recently aroused great interest among the writers, filmmakers, and journalists visiting here.

Sixty-year-old Wu Dan is the Deputy Director of the Technical Safety Department of the First Automobile Factory. His three sons and three daughters-in-law all work in the same factory as him. The eldest son, Wu Yazhou, and the second son, Wu Hanzhong, both interned at the Moscow Automobile Factory in the Soviet Union. Wu Yazhou now serves as the Deputy Director of the Automobile Trial Production Workshop; Wu Hanzhong is the foreman of the Trial Production Section of the Tool Workshop; and the third son, Wu Hua, works as a Russian translator in the factory. One of Wu Dan's three daughters-in-law is a clerk, another is a warehouse keeper, and the youngest is a drilling apprentice who has been in the factory for less than half a year.

With the birth of China's new automobile manufacturing industry, two generations of the Wu family ended their history of repairing foreign cars and began a career of working to manufacture domestic cars.

As early as 1912, when Wu Dan was sixteen years old, the first few foreign cars appeared on the streets of his hometown, Harbin. From that time on, Wu Dan began to learn automobile assembly technology. In 1938, Wu Dan personally taught his eldest son the technology of repairing automobiles and sent his second son to the factory where he had apprenticed to be an apprentice. At that time, a family of two generations of automobile repair workers was formed.

Around 1952, the country was brewing the implementation of the great first five-year plan; the construction of the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant was included in this plan. After hearing this news, Wu Dan immediately wrote a report to the former Northeast Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, requesting to be transferred to participate in the construction of the automobile factory. Not many days later, his request was approved. At that time, his second son had already been transferred from an automobile repair factory in Beijing to the automobile factory and was sent to the Soviet Union for an internship. Subsequently, his eldest son, third son, eldest daughter-in-law, and second daughter-in-law were also transferred from Shenyang and other places to the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant one after another to participate in the construction of the factory.

On New Year's Day this year, the Wu family added a new member: the third son married a rural girl named Han Yulan. Seeing that the whole family was in the automobile factory, the bride also wanted to be an automobile worker. Not long after getting married, Han Yulan told her father-in-law, mother-in-law, and husband about her idea, and they immediately welcomed and supported her. In February of this year, she was admitted to the factory and studied drilling in the stamping workshop.

Wu Dan has five grandsons and granddaughters: the ten-year-old eldest grandson is in the third grade at the Automobile Workers' Elementary School; two are in the factory's kindergarten; and the other two are taken care of at home by their grandmother.

The factory's administrative and trade union leaders have repeatedly advised Wu Dan to retire, but he always refuses to admit he is old and insists on dedicating his later years to China's new automobile industry. Wu Dan often goes hunting in the suburbs, and his body is as healthy as a young man. He told reporters: "In another ten years, I will be able to see my grandchildren enter the automobile factory."

    汽车工人之家
    新华社记者　康国志
    吴丹一家七口人同在第一汽车制造厂工作，这件事近来引起了在这里访问的文学、电影和新闻工作者很大的兴趣。
    六十岁的吴丹，是第一汽车厂技术安全处的副处长，他的三个儿子、三个儿媳妇，和他同在一个工厂里工作。大儿子亚洲和二儿子汉忠，都曾经在苏联莫斯科汽车工厂实习过。亚洲现在担任汽车试制车间的副主任；汉忠是工具车间试制工部工长；三儿子吴华，在工厂里当俄语习译。吴丹的三个儿媳妇，一个是职员，一个是仓库保管员；最小的一个，是进厂还不到半年的钻床徒工。
    随着新中国汽车制造工业的诞生，吴家两代结束了修配外国汽车的历史，开始了为制造国产汽车而工作的生涯。
    远在1912年，当时十六岁的吴丹的家乡——哈尔滨街头，出现了最初几部外国汽车。从那时候起，吴丹就开始学习汽车装配技术。1938年间，吴丹亲手教授他的大儿子学习修配汽车的技术，并且把二儿子送进他自己当初学过的工厂去当学徒。那时候，两代修配汽车的工人家庭就形成了。
    1952年间，全国正在酝酿着执行伟大的第一个五年计划；第一汽车制造厂的建设，就包括在这个计划之内。吴丹听到这个消息之后，立即写报告给原中共中央东北局，请求调他参加汽车厂的建设。相隔没有几天，他的请求被批准了。那时候，他的二儿子已经从北京的一个汽车修配厂先调到汽车厂，并且被派往苏联实习去了。随后，他的大儿子、三儿子和大儿媳、二儿媳，也都从沈阳等地陆续调到第一汽车制造厂，参加了工厂建设。
    今年元旦，吴家增加了新的成员：三儿子同一位农村姑娘韩玉兰结了婚。新娘子看见全家老少都在汽车厂，自己也想作一名汽车工人。过门不久，韩玉兰把自己的主意告诉了公公、婆婆和爱人，当即得到他们的欢迎和支持。今年二月，她就考入了工厂，在冲压车间学习钻工。
    吴丹有五个孙子和孙女：十岁的大孙子在汽车工人小学里念三年级；两个在工厂的幼儿园里；另外两个在家由奶奶照管着。
    工厂的行政同工会领导干部，曾一再劝说吴丹养老退休，可是他总不服老，一定要把自己的晚年献给新中国的汽车工业。吴丹时常去郊野游猎，身体锻炼得像壮年人一样健康。他对记者说：“再过十年，我就可以看见我的孙儿、孙女们进入汽车工厂”。
