Xinhua News Agency, July 9th. At a recent forum jointly convened by the State Council's Fourth Office, Fifth Office, and Eighth Office, many business and industry representatives frankly raised many opinions and criticisms regarding the transformation of private industry and commerce and other related government work. Heads of relevant government departments also responded to some important opinions.

The forum was held from the 6th to the 9th. The business and industry representatives who spoke at the meeting included Le Songsheng, Bi Mingqi, Wang Yuanxing, Xiang De, Chen Zupai, Zhu Jisheng, Wang Yizhi, Miao Hainan, Tong Shaosheng, Tang Di Yin, Hu Ziying, Ye Yutian, Liu Jingji, Gong Tianmin, Hu Ziang, Chen Suiheng, Feng Yunhe, and others, totaling seventeen people. They represented more than one hundred and forty industrialists and merchants who participated in the forum and expressed many opinions. In their speeches, they expressed satisfaction and support for the two speeches made by Vice Premier Chen Yun at the Third Session of the First National People's Congress on June 18th and 30th. They expressed gratitude for the government's care for industrialists and merchants. They believed that these two reports solved many problems existing in the current socialist transformation of private industry and commerce and should be widely and deeply publicized and thoroughly implemented.

When discussing issues after the public-private partnership of enterprises, they reflected many situations and raised many criticisms and opinions on issues such as public-private relations, personnel arrangements, wage treatment, fixed interest on stocks, and arrangements for small merchants and peddlers. They believed that the current public-private relations in some enterprises are not good enough, and the enthusiasm and business talents of private personnel have not been brought into play. Some public representatives did not consult with private personnel in their work, did not pay enough attention to their opinions, and were not bold enough or trusting enough in their use. In terms of personnel arrangements, many people said in their speeches that personnel arrangements were generally made through consultation and were relatively appropriate, but some arrangements were not reasonable enough. For example, some people with technical skills were arranged to do non-technical work, and some private personnel who should have been arranged have not yet been arranged.

They also criticized some shortcomings in the government's work. In terms of foreign trade, they criticized that some cadres in this department had a relatively rigid and simplistic style and did not have enough understanding of the international market situation. The variety of export commodities often could not meet the needs of foreign markets. Some commodities were of poor quality, poorly packaged, or did not fulfill the provisions of the contract, affecting the country's reputation in the international market. Some speeches criticized that some tax cadres were not democratic enough in their work style, simply rushing to complete tasks without a good grasp of policies. Industrialists and merchants engaged in the textile industry suggested that the state should actively develop the artificial fiber industry to meet the people's needs. Private personnel in the traditional Chinese medicine industry criticized the phenomenon of shortages of medicinal materials.

These opinions from industrialists and merchants were taken seriously by various government departments. On the 9th, Jia Tuofu, Director of the State Council's Fourth Office, Xu Dixing, Deputy Director of the State Council's Eighth Office, Zeng Shan, Minister of Commerce, Ye Jizhuang, Minister of Foreign Trade, Wu Bo, Vice Minister of Finance, Fang Fang, Deputy Director of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, and Li Zaiwen, Secretary of the Secretariat of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, spoke on issues related to their respective departments that were mentioned in the forum by industrialists and merchants.

In his speech, Jia Tuofu believed that in the past, business departments only held professional meetings, and business managers heard more opinions from within the business departments and less opinions from other relevant parties. This made business managers' views and handling of problems not comprehensive enough, and even led to deviations. Therefore, he believed that it is absolutely necessary to regularize this kind of forum at both the central and provincial and municipal levels in the future. This is one of the effective methods to overcome subjectivism and bureaucracy in work. He also expressed his opinions on the issues of production reorganization and production arrangement after the joint operation of enterprises.

Xu Dixing focused on issues such as fixed interest rates and personnel arrangements for public-private joint ventures. He said that this July or August, public-private joint ventures in various places must pay half a year's fixed interest to private shareholders, and then pay interest quarterly. For some enterprises where the amount of private shares has not yet been determined, a certain amount of dividends can be temporarily paid, and then adjusted according to the actual amount after the amount of shares is determined. For enterprises that implemented joint operation this year, the fixed interest rate for private shares should generally be calculated from January 1st. Regarding the issue of personnel arrangements, he said that the government's policy of covering private personnel in service at the time of the public-private joint operation of capitalist industry and commerce is being implemented in various places. However, good things cannot be done all at once. First, private personnel in service at the time of the joint operation, including the directors and supervisors of the enterprise, should be arranged and employed according to their talents. For private personnel other than those in service at the time of the joint operation, the state should also adopt various other methods to solve them step by step, such as social employment, which is one of the methods. As for the private personnel who were in service in the old joint venture enterprises, if they were not arranged at that time and are now unemployed, they should also be given work. For those who have already been arranged but the arrangement is not reasonable, the business departments in various places should make adjustments.

Zeng Shan talked about the arrangements for small merchants and peddlers in his speech. He said that in addition to making proper arrangements for small merchants and peddlers in accordance with Vice Premier Chen Yun's speech at the Third Session of the National People's Congress, the Ministry of Commerce is also prepared to implement some other methods, such as roughly dividing the sales of goods among state-owned commerce, supply and marketing cooperatives, public-private joint ventures, and small merchants and peddlers. State-owned, cooperative, and public-private joint ventures can sell less or not sell some sporadic commodities sold by small merchants and peddlers in retail. The wholesale and retail price difference for sporadic commodities should be appropriately expanded. The wholesale stations designated by state-owned and cooperative societies should enable all types of small merchants and peddlers in various places to obtain the necessary income in accordance with the different specific situations of small merchants and peddlers in various places. In places where small merchants and peddlers cannot maintain themselves, the agency sales commission can be appropriately expanded. Zeng Shan said that if small merchants and peddlers in a region and an industry still have difficulties after the implementation of this series of measures, some can be absorbed by the supply and marketing cooperatives, some can be merged, and some can be transferred to other places by adjusting the commercial network, so that they can all get the income they deserve. This measure also applies to service industries.

Ye Jizhuang expressed his sincere acceptance of the criticisms made by industrialists and merchants on the work of foreign trade. He said that in the future, the foreign trade department should listen to and study the opinions of the industrial and commercial circles more in its work, and experienced international trade talents in the industrial and commercial circles will be absorbed into the leading organs to work, and those who have not been well arranged in this regard in the past should be re-adjusted.

Li Zaiwen talked about the issue of private personnel participating in socialist competition in his speech. He said that it is undoubtedly welcome for private personnel to participate in socialist competition. If they make contributions to production and business management, and they belong to inventions, technical improvements, and rationalization proposals related to production, they should be handled in accordance with the regulations on rewards issued by the former Government Administration Council. Private personnel who make contributions to production and business management should be given honorary titles in addition to material rewards.

Huang Yanpei, Chairman of the China Democratic National Construction Association, and Chen Shutong, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, also spoke at the meeting. Huang Yanpei said: The government's decision to convene this forum is a wise decision and has yielded great gains. This meeting was convened on a new basis, which is the new policy of "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision" and "letting a hundred flowers bloom" of various parties. He asked the organizations and members of the China Democratic National Construction Association to be brave in reflecting problems and opinions. Chen Shutong said: This forum is a beginning and a demonstration. Everyone has raised many opinions and heard the speeches of the leaders. Everyone is excited and encouraged. There will be new problems in the future, and they will be resolved at the regular forums in the future. The All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce should do a good job in preparing for the convening of the forum.

Finally, Vice Premier Chen Yun emphasized instructions on the issue of public-private relations. He said that public-private relations, that is, how the public and private parties will cooperate in enterprises in the future, is a central issue in the relationship between industrialists and merchants and the government in the future. This issue is a matter of personal concern for industrialists and merchants, and it is also a major task for government business departments. Government business departments have the responsibility to unite all private personnel in the enterprise and actively help them to carry out ideological transformation. If government business departments fail to do this work well, their work will suffer losses.

Chen Yun then pointed out some specific measures to improve public-private relations. He believed that:

(1) Regular forums between government business departments and industrial and commercial circles should be held at the central and provincial and municipal levels to fully reflect the situation, exchange opinions, and put forward criticisms and solutions. This meeting should be actively convened by government business departments, but the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce and the China Democratic National Construction Association can urge and propose it. These forums can be large or small, and can also be meetings of representative figures of small and medium-sized industrialists and merchants, because they account for the majority of the industrial and commercial circles. Professional forums can also be held. Various places can hold two or three or five or six times a year as needed. The content of the forum should be notified early so that the industrial and commercial circles can prepare early. The problems raised at the meeting should be solved if they can be solved; some problems can be temporarily discussed but not decided for the sake of mature deliberation, and then decided later.

(2) Business improvement committees should be organized by industry and trade under the leadership of government business departments. Such committees can be established at both the central and local levels, and experienced and technically skilled private personnel should be absorbed to participate in them in order to give play to their business talents and promote improvement work. The personnel participating in this business improvement committee should be in the minority in the central government and the majority in the local governments in order to maintain their contact with the local governments.

(3) Professional meetings of public and private representatives should be convened separately to exchange and promote the experience of doing this work well. The public representatives' meeting should be convened by the government business department, and the private representatives' meeting should be convened by the local federations of industry and commerce at the beginning to study how to improve public-private relations.

(4) Documents on business guidelines and policies should be made available to private personnel through appropriate means, such as business documents issued by the administrative system, publishing the main points of the documents in newspapers, etc. Chen Yun pointed out that improving public-private relations is not only a matter for public representatives, because there are public shares, private parties, trade unions, and party committees in public-private joint ventures, and they are in different positions and may not have the same view of the problem. To improve public-private relations, all four parties must work together to reach a consensus. Chen Yun finally said that the relations of production have undergone fundamental changes and have many conditions, coupled with active and effective measures, it is entirely possible to gradually improve public-private relations.

Huang Yanpei, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, Chen Shutong, Chairman of the China Democratic National Construction Association, and the vice chairmen, executive committee members, central committee members of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce and the China National Democratic Construction Association and the heads of these two organizations in the provinces and cities attended the forum.

Vice Premier of the State Council Chen Yun, Vice Premier of the State Council and Director of the Fifth Office Li Xiannian, and Director of the Fourth Office Jia Tuofu attended the meeting. The deputy directors of the Fourth, Fifth, and Eighth Offices of the State Council and the ministers or vice ministers of the Ministry of Textile Industry, Ministry of Food Industry, Ministry of Light Industry, Ministry of Commerce, Ministry of Foreign Trade, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of First Machine Building Industry, Ministry of Agricultural Products Procurement, Ministry of Grain, and Ministry of Urban Services, and the deputy director of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, and the directors or deputy directors of the Central Handicraft Administration and the Central Administration for Industry and Commerce also attended the meeting; the heads of departments such as the People's Bank of China, the Preparatory Committee of the All-China Federation of Handicraft Production Cooperatives, the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives, and the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, as well as the directors of professional bureaus and managers of professional companies under the industrial, commercial, foreign trade, and transportation ministries. The heads of commercial departments (bureaus) of the Ministry of Commerce attending the conference also participated in the forum, totaling more than 310 people.

    工商界人士和政府业务部门负责人举行座谈会
    交换对私营工商业改造的意见
    陈云副总理着重就公私关系问题作了指示
    新华社9日讯　在国务院第四办公室、第五办公室和第八办公室最近联合召开的一个座谈会上，许多工商界人士对私营工商业改造工作和政府其他有关的工作，坦率地提出了许多意见和批评。政府有关部门的负责人并对一些重要的意见作了答复。
    这个座谈会是六日到九日举行的，在会上发言的工商界人士有乐松生、毕鸣岐、王源兴、向德、陈祖沛、朱继圣、王宜之、苗海南、童少生、汤蒂因、胡子婴、叶雨田、刘靖基、巩天民、胡子昂、陈邃衡、酆云鹤等十七人。他们代表参加座谈会的一百四十多个工商业者发表了许多意见。他们在发言中对陈云副总理六月十八日和三十日在第一届全国人民代表大会第三次会议上的两次发言表示满意和拥护，对于政府对工商业者的关怀表示感激，他们认为这两个报告解决了不少目前私营工商业社会主义改造中存在的问题，应该广泛深入地进行宣传，很好地贯彻下去。
    他们在谈到企业公私合营后的问题时，就公私关系、人事安排、工资待遇、定股定息以及小商小贩的安排等问题反映了很多情况并提出了不少的批评和意见。他们认为目前有些企业公私关系还不够好，私方人员的积极性和业务才能没有得到发挥，有的公股代表在工作上没有和私方人员协商，对私方人员的意见不够重视，对他们在使用上不够放手、不够信任。在人事安排方面，许多人在发言中认为人事安排一般是经过协商，安排得比较妥当的，但也有一些安排得不够合理，例如有技术的被安排去做非技术性的工作，还有一些应该安排的私方人员，到现在还没有得到安排。
    他们对政府某些工作上的缺点也提出了批评。在对外贸易方面，他们批评这一部门的某些干部作风比较生硬简单，对国际市场情况了解得不够；出口商品的花色品种常常不能满足国外市场需要；有的商品质量不高、包装不好或没有履行合同的规定，影响了国家在国际市场上的信誉等。有的发言中批评了某些税收干部作风不够民主，单纯赶任务，没有很好的掌握政策。从事纺织工业的工商界人士建议国家应积极发展人造纤维工业以满足人民需要。国药业的私方人员对于药材脱销的现象提出了批评。
    工商界人士的这些意见受到政府各部门的重视。九日，国务院第四办公室主任贾拓夫、国务院第八办公室副主任许涤新、商业部部长曾山、对外贸易部部长叶季壮、财政部副部长吴波、华侨事务委员会副主任方方、中华全国总工会书记处书记栗再温分别就工商界人士座谈中提到的与各部门有关的问题作了发言。
    贾拓夫在发言中认为过去业务部门只开专业会议，业务主管人员，听业务部门内部反映的意见多，听其他有关方面反映意见少，这样就使业务主管人员对问题的看法和处理不够全面，甚至发生偏差，因此他认为今后把这种座谈会在中央和省市两级经常化是完全必要的。这是克服工作中主观主义和官僚主义的有效方法之一。他还对企业合营后的生产改组和生产安排问题发表了意见。
    许涤新着重谈到公私合营企业的定息和人事安排等问题。他说今年七月或者八月各地公私合营企业对私股一定要发上半年的定息，以后按季发息。有些企业，目前私股股额尚未确定的，也可以暂发一定数额的股息，等股额确定后再按实调整。今年实行合营的企业，私股定息，一般从一月一日算起。关于人事安排问题。他说，在资本主义工商业实行公私合营的时候，政府对私方在职人员包下来的政策，各地正在贯彻执行。但是，好事不能一下子就做完，首先应该把在合营的时候的私方在职人员包括企业的董事、监事，安排下来，量才录用。对合营时在职人员以外的私方人员，国家也要有步骤地分别采用其他各种方式去解决，例如社会就业就是其中的一种方式。至于老合营企业的私方在职人员，如果当时没有安排而现在没有职业的，也要给以工作。对于已经得到安排，但安排得不合理的，各地业务部门应该进行调整。
    曾山在发言中谈到对小商小贩的安排问题，他说商业部除按照陈云副总理在全国人民代表大会第三次会议上的发言，对小商小贩作妥善的安排以外，还准备实行一些其他的办法，如在国营商业、供销合作社、公私合营商业和小商小贩之间，对商品的销售大体作一个分工。有些由小商小贩出卖的零星商品，国营、合作社和公私合营商业，在零售方面可以少卖或不卖。零星商品的批零差价应当适当扩大。国营和合作社指定的合作小组批发站，应当按照各地小商贩不同的具体情况，使各地各类的小商贩，都能获得必需的收入。在小商贩不能维持的地方，可以适当扩大代购代销手续费。曾山说，实行这一系列的办法后，如果在一个地区和一个行业中的小商贩仍有困难，就可由供销合作社吸收一部分，合并一部分，还可以通过调整商业网，向外地迁移一部分，这样使他们都得到应得的收入。这个措施也适用于服务性行业。
    叶季壮对于工商界人士对对外贸易工作提出的批评表示诚恳接受。他说，今后对外贸易部门在工作上要更多的听取和研究工商界方面的意见，工商界中有经验的国际贸易人才将吸收到领导机关来工作，过去在这方面安排得不好的要重新加以调整。
    栗再温发言中谈到私方人员参加社会主义竞赛的问题。他说私方人员参加社会主义竞赛毫无疑问是应该受到欢迎的。他们在生产和经营管理上有贡献，属于有关生产的发明、技术改进及合理化建议的，应当按照前政务院发布的奖励条例办事。在生产和经营管理上有贡献的私方人员，除给予物质奖励以外还应当给予荣誉称号。
    中国民主建国会主任委员黄炎培、中华全国工商联主任委员陈叔通也在会上讲了话，黄炎培说：政府这次召集座谈会是英明的决定，有很大的收获，这个会是在新的基础上召开的，这个基础就是各党派“长期共存，互相监督”和“百家争鸣”的新方针。他要求民建会组织和成员要勇于反映问题和意见。陈叔通说：这次座谈会是一个开端，而且是一个示范。大家提出了很多意见，又听到各位负责人的讲话，大家都感到欢欣鼓舞。今后还有新的问题，将来要在定期座谈会上解决。工商联要做好召开座谈会的准备工作。
    国务院副总理陈云最后着重就公私关系问题作了指示。他说，公私关系，即公私双方今后在企业中如何合作共事，是今后工商业者和政府关系中的一个中心问题。这个问题是工商界的切身事情，也是政府工商业务部门的一项重大工作。政府业务部门有责任团结企业中的所有私方人员积极帮助他们进行思想改造；政府业务部门如果没有做好这一工作，就会使工作受到损失。
    陈云接着指出了搞好公私关系的一些具体措施，他认为：
      （一）要在中央和省、市两级，把政府业务部门和工商界的定期座谈会开好，在会上充分反映情况，交换意见，提出批评和办法。这个会应由政府工商业务部门主动召集，但工商联，民建会可以督促、提议。这种座谈会可以开大型的，也可以开小型的；还可以开中小工商业者代表人物的会议，因为他们占工商界中的大多数。也可以开专业性质的座谈会。各地可根据需要，一年开二、三次或五、六次。会前应该把座谈内容早作通知，让工商界早作准备。会上提出的问题，能解决的，就加以解决；有些问题，为了酝酿成熟，可以暂时议而不决，以后再来决定。
    （二）在工商业务部门领导下按行按业组织业务改进委员会，这种委员会，中央和地方都可设立，吸收有经验、有技术的私方人员参加。以发挥他们的业务才能，推动改进工作。参加这种业务改进委员会的人员应该少数在中央，多数在地方，以保持他们和地方上的联系。
    （三）分别召开公股、私股代表的专业会议，交流和推广做好这一工作的经验，公股代表会议由政府业务部门召集，私股代表会议开始的时候，由各地工商联召集、研究如何改善公私关系。
    （四）有关业务方针政策的文件应通过适当的方式，使私方人员能看到，如业务文件由行政系统下达，把文件的要点在报纸上发表等等。陈云指出，搞好公私关系不是公股代表一方面的事，因为公私合营企业中有公股、私方、工会和党委四个方面的人员，他们所处地位不同，看问题不一定相同，要搞好公私关系必须这四个方面共同努力，认识一致。陈云最后说现在生产关系已经起了根本变化，具备了许多条件，再加上积极有效的措施，逐步搞好公私关系是完全可能的。
    参加座谈会的有中华全国工商业联合会主任委员陈叔通、中国民主建国会主任委员黄炎培以及全国工商联和中国民主建国会的副主任委员、执行委员、中央委员和这两个组织的省、市负责人。
    国务院副总理陈云、国务院副总理、第五办公室主任李先念、第四办公室主任贾拓夫都参加了这次会议。参加会议的还有国务院第四、第五、第八办公室的副主任和纺织工业部、食品工业部、轻工业部、商业部、对外贸易部、财政部、第一机械工业部、农产品采购部、粮食部、城市服务部、水产部的部长或副部长、华侨事务委员会的副主任、中央手工业管理局、中央工商行政管理局的局长或副局长；中国人民银行、中华全国手工业生产合作社联合总社筹委会、全国供销合作总社、中华全国总工会等部门的负责人，以及工业、商业、对外贸易、交通等部所属的专业局局长和专业公司的经理。出席商业部商业厅（局）长会议的各省商业厅、局长也参加了座谈会，共三百一十多人。
