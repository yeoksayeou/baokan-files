Xinhua News Agency, July 8th: London dispatch: Ceylon's Prime Minister Bandaranaike told the press on July 7th that Ceylon intends to establish diplomatic relations with as many countries as possible, and intends to establish diplomatic relations with Moscow and Beijing "at an early date."

He believes that "the real key to world peace lies in expanding trade freedom, regardless of specific ideologies." He expressed his hope to develop trade relations with all countries, both East and West.

Talking about Ceylon's relationship with Britain and Ceylon's relationship with the United States and the Soviet Union, Bandaranaike said: "I think our relationship with Britain is much closer than with a country like Russia, and much closer than with the United States. As a member of the Commonwealth, we have very close and friendly relations with Britain."

Reporters paid close attention to the Anglo-Ceylon agreement. A reporter asked him what the actual effect of the Anglo-Ceylon agreement was, and whether the "facilities" that Ceylon guaranteed to provide to Britain were for a transitional period or for a longer term. As everyone knows, Britain and Ceylon reached an agreement in London on July 6th, which stipulates that Britain should hand over its military bases in Ceylon, and Ceylon agrees to continue to provide Britain with certain "facilities" that Britain currently enjoys.

Bandaranaike said: According to the Anglo-Ceylon agreement, the two countries will soon conduct the necessary arrangements for the transfer of bases in London and then in Colombo. He believes that the "actual effect" of this agreement "is indeed very great, because these bases will become ours, and the equipment given to Britain only involves some small things."

He explained that the "facilities" given to Britain will be "limited to" the use of armaments and oil depots and the use of telecommunications equipment. 90% of the British personnel at the bases will leave.

He added that the facilities provided to Britain "must not restrict our right to freely decide what action we should take once a war breaks out."

Bandaranaike reiterated that allowing Britain to continue to retain bases is contrary to his government's policy of not participating in major power blocs.

Bandaranaike said he welcomes any economic assistance "without conditions."

He also expressed his hope to go to the United States in November to attend the United Nations General Assembly. By that time, he hopes to be able to hold talks with American leaders, and hopes to visit the Soviet Union and China after that.

    班达拉奈克总理表示
    锡兰将尽早同中苏建交
    希望和一切国家发展贸易关系
    新华社八日讯　伦敦消息：锡兰总理班达拉奈克七月七日向报界说，锡兰打算同尽可能多的国家建立外交关系，并且打算“早日”同莫斯科和北京建立外交关系。
    他认为“世界和平的真正关键在于扩大贸易自由，不管具体的意识形态如何。”他表示希望同东西双方一切国家发展贸易关系。
    谈到锡兰同英国的关系以及锡兰同美国和苏联的关系时，班达拉奈克说：“我认为我们同英国的关系比像俄国这样的一个国家的关系密切得多，也比同美国的关系密切得多。我们作为一个英联邦成员国，同英国有很密切和友好的关系。”
    记者们对英锡协议很注意。有记者问他，英锡协议的实际作用究竟怎样，锡兰保证向英国提供的“便利”究竟是供过渡时期用的呢还是比较长期的。大家知道，英国和锡兰七月六日在伦敦达成一个协议，其中规定英国应该交出它在锡兰的军事基地，锡兰则同意继续向英国提供英国目前享有的某些“便利”。
    班达拉奈克说：根据英锡协议，两国将很快在伦敦，随后在科伦坡进行有关移交基地的必要安排。他认为这个协议的“实际作用的确很大，因为这些基地将成为我们的，给予英国的设备仅仅涉及某些小东西。”
    他解释说：给予英国的“便利”将“只限于”使用军火和石油仓库以及使用电讯设备。英国在基地上人员的90％将离去。
    他又说：向英国提供的便利“决不能限制一旦爆发战争我们自由决定应该采取什么行动的权利。”
    班达拉奈克重申，让英国继续保留基地，是违背他的政府不参加大国集团的政策的。
    班达拉奈克表示他欢迎任何“不附有条件”的经济援助。
    他还表示希望在十一月间去美国出席联合国大会，到那个时候他希望能够同美国领导人员举行会谈，并且希望在这之后再到苏联和中国进行访问。
