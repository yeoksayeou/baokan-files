    In the Gurbantunggut Desert
    By our reporter Shen Shi
    The Gurbantunggut Desert, lying across the center of the Junggar Basin, has sand dunes piled up by the wind, rising and falling like waves in the sea. Except for the snowy season, when Kazakhs occasionally cross the desert in teams on camels, one rarely encounters travelers in the desert on ordinary days.

    The oil exploration team spent six years traversing the vast wilderness around the desert, leaving only this 26,000 square kilometers of desert untouched.

    Whenever they surveyed the edge of the desert and considered that several oil-bearing structures had been discovered around it, they wondered if there was hope for oil in the desert itself. Gazing at the vast expanse of yellow sand, the ambition of the young people was always eager to try.

    To eliminate the blank spot in the exploration of the Junggar Basin, the Xinjiang Petroleum Administration decided to launch a large-scale geological survey in this desert to uncover its mysteries.

    However, it is difficult to find a drop of water after walking all over the desert. To survey here, the first problem to solve is drinking water. If construction were carried out after the thaw as in previous years, water would have to be transported from places with water on the edge of the desert. Automobiles cannot travel in the desert, so camels are needed to carry water. A round trip for a camel would easily be one or two hundred kilometers, which would not only take a lot of time, but the water carried was often not enough for the camels to drink. The Xinjiang Petroleum Administration broke with convention and changed the construction season to the snowy season.

    The young survey team members, some of whom had spent hot summers in the Turpan Basin, some of whom had waded through knee-deep mud in swampy areas, suffering the bites of mosquitoes and gnats, and some of whom had crossed icy rapids during the flood season, were now trying winter field work for the first time.

    The order to advance into the desert was issued, cold-weather equipment was prepared, and food and meat were carried in sufficient quantities. In early February, the team members left the warm houses, divided into two routes, north and south, and set off one after another. A tense and arduous battle unfolded in the Gurbantunggut Desert.

    One afternoon, we took a route map for the visit and set off from Urumqi towards the southern edge of the desert. When we arrived at a county town at the foot of the northern Tianshan Mountains, we asked the county people's committee about the location of the survey team's residence, but no one there knew. We got the same answer when we asked the county committee. Should we continue forward? Who should we ask for directions? Should we turn back? How could we make a fruitless trip? Just as we were hesitating, a car came up in front of us. The people in the car knew where we wanted to go. They led us for a while, and our car finally left the road and drove north. Passing several alkali flats, one sand dune after another appeared before our eyes.

    At dusk, we finally arrived at the survey team's base.

    Green tents formed a temporary village on the edge of the desert, the sun was setting, and the horizon was red. Camels that had just shed their fur slowly meandered among the red willow and reed bushes, choosing edible weeds.

    The team members returned one after another, their hair tousled and their faces dark, making it clear that they had endured wind and sun.

    Two years ago, I had seen the engineers with graying temples exploring the Sojak Glacier on the Tibetan Plateau, and visited the heroes who climbed the cliffs on the banks of the Nujiang River in search of routes. Today, I saw these people who blazed trails for China's petroleum industry in front of the Gurbantunggut Desert, and my heart could not help but be stirred.

    Comrade Xue Yingxuan of the guiding line survey team also arrived here from a distant place on the same day. He had been measuring back and forth in the Junggar and Tarim Basins for five years. The days he spent with Soviet experts Badoteva, Rogalov, and Zhubashkov slowly turned him from a novice who couldn't operate a theodolite into a skilled captain. In his long field life, what he couldn't forget was the unusual New Year he spent on the edge of the desert this time.

    The tents were set up, and more than a hundred camels arrived one after another. The comrades, when they first came here, all said in unison: "Isn't this place called Tang Dynasty City? Where is the city?"

    Xue Yingxuan pointed to the tents and said, "Aren't these many tents a city?"

    The appearance of a "tent city" on the snowy edge of the desert was indeed unprecedented.

    Two days later, it was the Spring Festival. The cook checked the supplies, and the radishes and potatoes were all frozen on the way. The clever cook knew how everyone felt. He stewed the meat until it was tender so that the comrades could have a good New Year.

    The strong north wind swept across the unobstructed wilderness. The survey team members, who were spending their first winter in the field, began to experience the taste of severe cold. Inside each tent, a pile of dry firewood was burned, and people sat around the fire, some talking, some playing cards. In the captain's tent, a large group of people gathered around the radio, listening intently to the broadcast programs.

    "Let's listen to the Beijing broadcast!" Someone suggested loudly from the crowd.

    "Yes! Listen to the voice of the capital." Someone immediately responded.

    Soon, the sound waves emitted from the capital radio station, across thousands of mountains and rivers, were clearly transmitted to the tent. How exciting! On this silent desert thousands of miles away, on this unusual New Year's Day, the sound from the capital, from where Chairman Mao lived, made the edge of the desert sound and colorful, and closely connected the hearts of young people with the remote Zhongnanhai. Look! Outside the tent, workers of the Uygur and Kazakh nationalities were singing and dancing to their heart's content on the snow, celebrating this unforgettable festival together with the Han workers. On the northern edge of the desert, in the tents near Lake Ayar, the comrades of the Northern United Team were also attracted by this poetic festival.

    After the New Year, the groups set off separately.

    Measuring in the icy and snowy days is much more difficult than in the warm season. A thick cotton coat and felt boots up to the knees made it very inconvenient to move. The sand dunes were buried in deep snow. Holding the heavy instruments, they managed to climb up. When they came down, if they were not careful, they would slip and fall. "We must protect the instruments well! We must never let them be damaged in the slightest." Everyone was so concerned about the comrade who was holding the instrument. They knew that if the instrument was damaged, work would inevitably be stopped and the survey date would be delayed.

    The cold current came, and the fierce storm swept snowflakes all over the sky, and the temperature in the misty wilderness dropped to about minus forty degrees. Even in such severe cold, work did not stop. If the instrument froze, it was warmed in a cotton coat, and then it was measured forward.

    There was not much experience in the first winter construction, and something that was not expected at the beginning finally happened. After the blizzard passed, the snow layer disappeared, and the sunlight shone on the snow, reflecting dazzling light. Many people suffered from snow blindness, their eyelids were swollen and red, tears were flowing non-stop, and their vision became blurred. What to do if there are no colored glasses? Everyone came up with a clever idea, adding some salt to boiling water and washing their eyes several times a day, so that their vision gradually recovered. Soon, colored glasses were also rushed from Urumqi.

    As the climate warmed, the snow began to melt. Just as they were digging pits to store snow, a strong wind quickly dissipated the snow, and the groups had to use camels to deliver water.

    In May, measuring in the desert was like walking into a steaming oven. Teams of camels followed the surveyors closely, wherever they measured, the camels followed. The hotter the weather, the more water people and camels needed. There were not enough camels, and Chen Baozheng of the gravity measurement team asked to reduce the number of camels in his group to satisfy other groups. He thought that as long as he brought as few unnecessary utensils as possible, the camels could carry more water. Sure enough, doing as he thought increased the amount of water the camels carried.

    The area surveyed by Chen Baozheng's group was full of undulating sand mountains, and each guide line was as long as sixty kilometers. The camels followed them for a long distance every day, and they were easily exhausted. Chen Baozheng thought, why must the camels follow? Could we cross the desert from this guideline and insert it into another guideline? He discussed it with the camel drivers and learned that crossing over would save the camels dozens of kilometers. From then on, it was decided that the camels would only follow them for a section of the road, and then cross the desert to wait for them at the designated place on the second guideline. In this way, the camels not only traveled less, but also had time to recover from fatigue, and the amount of water they carried also increased. With sufficient drinking water, work efficiency also increased significantly, and they finally created a record of measuring twenty-five kilometers a day.

    In late June, the people from the north and south routes successively bid farewell to the desert and returned to Urumqi. In the past five months, the desert's strong winds, flying sand, severe cold, and scorching heat had not stopped them. In an area of 26,000 square kilometers, they inserted red flags every kilometer, buried wooden stakes, and obtained reliable information, paving the way for those who later entered the Gurbantunggut Desert.

    在库尔班通古特沙漠里
    本报记者　沈石
    库尔班通古特沙漠，横亘在准噶尔盆地的中央，被狂风堆成的沙丘，一起一伏，恰象大海中的波涛。除了积雪的季节，偶尔有哈萨克人骑着骆驼，结队横越沙漠外，在平常的日子里，沙漠中很少碰到行人。
    石油勘测队的人，经历了六个年头，走遍了沙漠周围辽阔的荒原，剩下来的，只是这二万六千平方公里的沙漠了。
    每当他们勘测到沙漠边缘，想到沙漠周围既然发现了好几处含油构造，沙漠里是不是也有含油的希望呢？远眺着莽莽黄沙，年轻人的雄心，谁不跃跃欲试。
    新疆石油管理局为了消灭准噶尔盆地勘测中的空白点，决定在这片沙漠上展开大规模的地质普查工作，来揭开沙漠之谜。
    然而，走遍沙漠，很难找到一滴水。要在这里勘测，首先得解决饮水问题。如果像往年一样，在解冻以后施工，需要从沙漠边缘有水的地方运水进去。沙漠中，不能行驶汽车，需要骆驼驮水，骆驼往返一趟，动辄一、二百公里，不但要花费许多时间，而且驮的水往往还不够骆驼喝。新疆石油管理局打破了常规，改在积雪的季节施工。
    年轻的勘测队员们，有的曾经在吐鲁番盆地度过酷热的夏天，有的曾经在沼泽地带，涉过齐膝深的泥沼，遭过蚊虻的吮刺，有的曾经在山洪暴发的季节里，淌过冰凉的急流，现在又初次来尝试冬天的野外生活了。
    向沙漠进军的命令发出了，御寒的装备准备停当，粮食肉类携带齐全。二月初，队员们走出暖烘烘的屋子，分成南北两路，先后出动，一幕紧张艰苦的战斗，在库尔班通古特沙漠展开了。
    一个下午，我们带着一张访问的路线图，从乌鲁木齐向沙漠南部的边缘出发。到了天山北麓的一座县城，向县人民委员会打听勘测队住的地方，那儿的人都不知道。问县委会，也落得同样的回答。继续前进吧，向谁问路呢？折回吧，怎能空劳往返？正在踌躇的时候，前面来了一辆汽车，车上的人知道我们要去的地方，他们在前面引了一段路，我们的车才离开公路线，向北行驶。越过几处碱滩，一座一座的沙丘，历历地陈现在眼前。
    黄昏时分，我们终于到了勘测队的基地。
    绿色的帐篷，构成了沙漠边缘临时的村落，夕阳西下了，天边映得通红。刚脱过毛的骆驼，慢吞吞地踯躅在红柳芦苇丛中，选择可吃的野草。
    队员们相继归来，蓬松的头发，黑黝黝的面孔，一看就知道他们是饱经风吹日晒的。
    两年前，我曾经在西藏高原上，见过那鬓发斑白探测索瓦卡冰川的工程师，访问过攀登怒江边上的悬崖绝壁，寻找线路的英雄。今天，我又在库尔班通古特沙漠跟前，见到这些披荆斩棘，为我国石油工业开路的人，我的心情怎不为之激动。
    导线测量队的薛应选同志，在同一天，从老远的地方也到了这里。他在准噶尔和塔里木盆地，前前后后测量了五个年头。和苏联专家巴多捷娃、罗加洛夫、朱巴什柯夫相处的日子里，使他从一个不会操作经纬仪的门外汉，慢慢地变成了熟练的队长。长期的野外生活中，使他不能忘记的，还是这次在沙漠边缘度过的别开生面的新年。
    帐篷撑起来了，一百多峰骆驼也陆续到齐了，同志们初来这里，都不约而同地说：“这里不是叫唐朝城吗？城在什么地方呢？”
    薛应选指着帐篷说：“这么多的帐篷，不是城吗？”
    在白雪皑皑的沙漠边缘，出现了“帐篷城”，的确是从来没有过的事。
    隔了两天，便是春节，炊事员检查家当，萝卜、马铃薯都在路上冻坏了。聪明的炊事员，懂得大家的心情，他把肉炖得烂烂的，让同志们痛痛快快地过年。
    强烈的朔风掠过没遮拦的原野，初次在野外过冬的勘测队员开始领略了严寒的滋味，每顶帐篷里面，烧起一堆干枯的柴火，人们围坐在火边，有的谈天，有的玩扑克，队长的帐篷里，收音机跟前，围聚着一大群人，在凝神地聆听播送的节目。
    “听听北京的广播吧！”有人从人群中高声地建议。
    “对！听听首都的声音。”随即有人响应。
    一会儿，从首都电台发射出的音波，越过千山万水，很清晰地传到帐篷里来了。多么兴奋啊！在这数千里外寂静的沙漠旁边，在这不平常的元旦日，从首都，从毛主席住的地方传来的声音，使沙漠边缘显得有声有色，把年轻人的心和遥远的中南海紧紧地联系在一起了。看！帐篷外面，维吾尔和哈萨克族的工人们，在雪地上尽情地歌舞，他们和汉族工人共同欢度这难忘的佳节。在沙漠北部的边缘，阿雅尔湖附近的帐篷里，北联队的同志们也被这有诗意的节日吸引住了。
    过了年，各小组分头出动了。
    在冰天雪地的日子里测量，比起温暖的季节来，困难多得多。一身很厚的棉衣，加上齐膝高的毡靴，行动很不方便。沙丘埋在深雪里，他们拿着笨重的仪器，好容易爬上去，下来时，如果不小心，便滑倒了。“要好好的保护仪器啊！绝不能让它稍有损坏”。每个人都这样关心拿仪器的同志，他们知道仪器损坏了，势必停工，势必拖延勘测的日期。
    寒流来了，凛冽的暴风卷着雪花满天飞舞，四野雾沉沉的温度降到零下四十度左右，即使这样的严寒，也没有停工。仪器冻住了，放在棉衣里暖一暖，接着又向前测去了。
    初次冬季施工，经验不多，当初没有料到的事，终于发生了。暴风雪过去，雪层消失了，阳光照在积雪上，反射出耀眼的光芒。许多人患了雪盲，眼皮肿得通红，泪水不停的流，视力也模糊起来。没带有色眼镜怎么办呢？大家急中生智，开水里加些食盐，一天洗上好几次，才使视力逐渐恢复过来，不久，有色眼镜也从乌鲁木齐赶运到了。
    气候转暖，雪开始融化，正在挖坑贮雪的时候，一场大风，雪很快地消失掉，各小组不得不用骆驼来送水了。
    五月里，在沙漠中测量，真的像走进了热腾腾的蒸笼。一队队的骆驼，紧跟着勘测人员，他们测到哪里，骆驼也跟到哪里。天气愈热，人和骆驼需要的水更多。骆驼不够用，重力测量队的陈宝正，要求减少组里的骆驼，来满足别的小组。他想，只要尽量少带不必要的用具，骆驼便可以多驮些水。果然，照着他所想的去做，骆驼驮水量增加了。
    陈宝正小组勘测的地带，尽是起伏不平的大沙山，每条导线长达六十公里。骆驼每天跟着他们走很远的路，容易疲乏。陈宝正想，为什么一定让骆驼跟着走呢？是不是可以从这一条导线，横穿沙漠，插到另一条导线上去呢？他和赶骆驼的工人商量，知道横越过去，骆驼可以少走几十公里。从此确定让骆驼跟着他们只走一段路，然后横穿沙漠，到第二条导线指定的地方等他们。这样，骆驼既少走了路，且有时间来恢复疲劳，驮水量也增加了，有了充裕的饮水，工作效率也显著的增加了，他们终于创造了日测二十五公里的纪录。
    六月下旬，南北两路的人，相继告别了沙漠，回到乌鲁木齐。五个月当中，沙漠里的狂风、飞沙、严寒、酷热，都没有阻挡住他们。他们在二万六千平方公里的面积上，每隔一公里，插上了红旗，埋下了木桩，取得了可靠的资料，为后来进入库尔班通古特沙漠的人们开辟了道路。
