    Several Issues Concerning the Implementation of the Party's Collective Leadership
    Xu Bangyi
    The principle of collective leadership is the highest principle of Party leadership and the foundation of Party building. Every leader, regardless of their position or accomplishments, must strictly adhere to this principle. How can we implement the principle of the Party's collective leadership and ensure that it is implemented earnestly and not merely in form? To achieve this, in addition to correctly understanding the relationship and role of the individual and the collective, we must pay close attention to the following issues.
    In order to genuinely implement the principle of the Party's collective leadership, leading personnel must possess certain qualities: namely, the qualities of humility and simplicity, the ability to subordinate individual will to collective will, and the ability to regard the interests of the Party and the people as paramount. Leading personnel who lack these noble qualities will not have effective collective leadership. It can be seen that the principle of collective leadership is often undermined in the following situations: when certain leading personnel are arrogant and conceited, emphasizing personal prestige, enjoying flattery and compliments, placing personal honor above the interests of the Party, regarding personal opinions as "absolute truth," only willing to have others agree with and endorse their opinions, and unwilling to allow others to raise objections or different opinions, let alone allow their opinions to be rejected by the majority; when a dispute arises over a certain issue, instead of being determined to subordinate personal will to collective will, they attempt to force others to submit to their will, even treating personal opinions as organizational conclusions, forcing all committee members to agree and all Party members to implement them. Lang Zongying, the Party Committee Secretary of the Shenyang Transformer Factory, and Ren Junjie, the factory director, arbitrarily undermined the Party's collective leadership system in order to compete for personal power. Instead of jointly studying and resolving problems, they frequently argued about "who has the final say" and "who leads whom." Therefore, the qualities of leading personnel are crucial for implementing the principle of the Party's collective leadership.
    The high level of principle of all members of the Party Committee and the ability to uphold principled struggle are also important conditions for earnestly implementing the principle of the Party's collective leadership. What will be the result of lacking principle and not engaging in principled struggle? Naturally, it will lead to the absence of standards of right and wrong, it will lead to personality cults, it will tolerate shortcomings and mistakes, it will give rise to flattery, compliments, and boasting, and it will prevent the Party organization from becoming a leading core built on principles. However, we often see people who clearly disagree with the erroneous opinions of a certain leading person, but they dare not express their opposition, nor do they dare to argue with the other party. Although the resolution is passed by the meeting, this kind of resolution still cannot reflect the collective opinion. As a result, the principle of collective leadership is violated. To correct this phenomenon, it is necessary not only to require each leading person to act according to principles, but also to require them to be good at fully promoting democracy, actively mobilizing the collective to launch principled discussions on certain issues, and conduct principled criticism of the leadership work. At the recent Party Congress held in Xinxiang City, Henan Province, it was not possible to launch a principled struggle at the beginning, mainly because many representatives had ideological concerns. In order to eliminate these concerns of the representatives, the previous Municipal Party Committee, in addition to conducting self-criticism, also used practical actions to support all principled struggles. After a small number of representatives exposed the erroneous behavior of Wang Damin, a candidate for the Municipal Party Committee member, the previous Municipal Party Committee, in collaboration with the congress, promptly organized a special group to conduct an in-depth investigation into Wang Damin's problems, confirming that the problems exposed by the representatives were true, and then suggested that the congress discuss revoking Wang Damin's candidacy. This effectively encouraged the representatives to carry out principled struggle. This example shows that only when the Party organization truly becomes a principled collective can it effectively implement collective leadership.
    The formal implementation of collective leadership is often manifested in the insufficient concern of certain Party committee members about the major issues discussed by the Party committee, especially those that are not directly related to themselves, and neither express support nor opposition. In this way, some Party committees form a pattern when discussing issues: the secretary reports, the committee members listen, the secretary decides, and the committee members agree; or the committee members casually express some feelings, indicate their attitude, and then perfunctorily pass the secretary's decision. The Party group of the Hebei Provincial Department of Transportation held many such meetings. Before the meeting, the members of the Party organization did not make full preparations, and at the meeting, everyone could not offer many opinions, so many major decisions were often passed after the unit in charge simply read aloud a draft prepared in advance. Although the Xiangtan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China held 67 municipal committee meetings from March of last year to April of this year, many major principled issues have not been completely resolved because there was no full discussion at the meetings. The reason for this is that some Party committee members have some incorrect views: some believe that all issues will ultimately have to be decided by the secretary and deputy secretary, and at the same time, they cannot offer good opinions, so it is better not to offer them; others regard the relationship between the Party committee secretary and the committee members as a relationship between superiors and subordinates, and the secretary has decided, and the committee members cannot veto it. Some hold the attitude of "minding one's own business," and have no interest in issues that are not closely related to themselves. To strengthen collective leadership for committee members, it is necessary to overcome these incorrect ideas and enable them to have a correct understanding of the principle of collective leadership.
    To implement the Party's principle of collective leadership, it is necessary to combine collective leadership with individual responsibility. Without individual responsibility, collective leadership will also become a formality. Lenin once expounded the correct relationship between the system of collective leadership and the system of individual responsibility. He said:
    "Whenever possible, the collective leadership system should be limited to the smallest possible scope of the committee, discussing the most important issues in the shortest possible time, and the responsibility for the actual handling of the agency, enterprise, personnel, and tasks should be entrusted to a comrade who is known for being firm, resolute, and decisive, good at handling practical problems, and enjoys the greatest trust. The collective leadership system should in any case and without exception be complemented by the most accurate definition of each person's individual responsibility for a specific matter. The phenomenon of no one being responsible, covered up by the collective leadership system, is the most dangerous disaster..." ("Everyone Should Fight Against Denikin")
    Now, some comrades do not regard collective leadership and individual responsibility as things that are mutually combined, but as things that are mutually opposed. As mentioned earlier, turning individual responsibility into individual dictatorship and abolishing collective leadership is one situation. Another situation is turning collective leadership into no one being responsible or being afraid of individual responsibility, and discussing everything in detail in collective meetings, which hinders the Party's practical work and creates procrastination, fatigue, and irresponsibility in the work. This kind of collective leadership will only create busy and hard-working bureaucrats and pragmatists, and will only cultivate meeting experts and empty talkers. In the past, the Guangping County Committee of Hebei Province brought many minor issues to the plenary meeting of the committee for discussion and approval. This not only increased the number of meetings and prolonged the meeting time, but also made a small number of county committee members and a small number of departments no longer think independently and deal with problems independently, becoming "megaphones" and "mailrooms." True collective leadership will never hinder lively practical work; true collective leadership must be combined with individual responsibility. All major issues related to principles and policies must undoubtedly be discussed and decided by the collective, but in the implementation, there must be a strict division of labor; all issues that have clear regulations, or are not related to major principles and policies, should be handled by individuals in accordance with the division of labor. This can strengthen collective leadership, improve work efficiency, and fully demonstrate the active and responsible spirit of all members of the Party Committee. It must be recognized that no one being responsible and daring to be responsible is a terrible and undesirable phenomenon, and allowing this phenomenon to exist will inevitably cause serious losses to practical work.
    To effectively implement the Party's principle of collective leadership, it is also necessary to improve the Party's meeting system. For example, Party congresses and delegate meetings should be held at regular intervals in accordance with the provisions of the Party Constitution, and plenary meetings and standing committee meetings of the Party Committee should be held regularly. These meetings can be used to broadly discuss and check work, and to conduct bold and realistic criticism and self-criticism; frequent meetings will make every Party member and Party cadre often feel responsible for the cause of the Party, and contribute their knowledge and experience without reservation. Practical experience has shown that adhering to this system will greatly enhance the role of collective leadership. Some county committees in Fujian Province and Shandong Province do not convene plenary committees very often, and some even do not convene standing committee meetings very often. Many major principled issues are decided by the county party secretary and individual members who exchange views and make decisions in the name of the Party Committee without authorization. This phenomenon should be regarded as a phenomenon that undermines the principle of collective leadership. As long as the meeting system of collective leadership is adhered to, this kind of behavior that undermines collective leadership can be prevented more effectively.

    实现党的集体领导的几个问题
    许邦仪
    集体领导的原则是党的领导的最高原则，是党的建设的基础。任何一个领导者，不论他的地位多高，功劳多大，都要严格地遵守这个原则。如何才能贯彻执行党的集体领导的原则，并且保证认真地而不是形式地执行集体领导的原则呢？要达到这一点，除了要正确地理解个人和集体的关系和作用外，必须切实注意以下一些问题。
    为了真正地执行党的集体领导的原则，领导人员必须具备一定的品质：这就是谦虚和朴素的品质，善于把个人的意志服从集体的意志的品质，把党和人民的利益看成高于一切的品质。领导人员缺少这些高贵的品质，就不会有切实有效的集体领导。可以看到，集体领导的原则，往往在以下情况遭到了破坏：这就是某些领导人员高傲自大，强调个人的威信，爱好别人的奉承和恭维，把个人的荣誉放到党的利益之上，把个人的意见看成是“绝对真理”，只愿意别人附和和赞同自己的意见，而不愿意别人提出反对和不同的意见，更不愿意自己的意见受到大多数人的否决；当某一个问题发生了不同意见的争论的时候，不是决心把个人的意志服从集体的意志，而是企图强迫别人服从自己的意志。甚至把个人意见当作组织结论，强使全体委员同意和全体党员执行。沈阳变压器厂党委书记郎宗颖，厂长任俊杰为了争夺个人权力，就任意破坏党的集体领导制度。他们不是共同研究解决问题，而是经常争论“谁说了算”、“谁领导谁”。因此，领导人员的品质对于贯彻执行党的集体领导原则是非常重要的。
    党委会所有成员的高度的原则性，和善于坚持原则斗争，也是认真地执行党的集体领导原则的重要条件。没有原则性，不开展原则性斗争就会造成什么结果呢？很自然，就会造成没有是非的标准，就会有个人崇拜，就会容忍缺点和错误，就会出现奉承恭维和吹牛拍马的现象，就会使党的组织不能成为建筑在原则基础上的领导核心。可是时常可以看到这样的人，明明不同意某个领导人员的错误意见，但是他不敢发表反对的意见，也不敢同对方进行争论，虽然决议是会议讨论通过的，但这种决议，同样不能反映集体的意见。结果，同样违反了集体领导的原则。纠正这种现象，不但要求每个领导人员本身要按原则办事，并且要求他们善于充分发扬民主，积极发动集体来展开对某些问题的原则性的讨论，对领导工作进行原则性的批评。最近河南新乡市召开的党代表大会，开始时不能展开原则性的斗争。主要是不少代表有着思想顾虑。前届市委为了消除代表们的这种顾虑，除进行自我批评外，还用实际行动来支持一切原则性的斗争。当少数代表揭发市委委员候选人王达民的错误行为以后，前届市委协同大会及时组织了专门小组，对王达民的问题进行了深入的调查，证实代表所揭发的问题是真实的，于是建议大会讨论撤销王达民候选人的资格。这样，有效地鼓舞了代表们进行原则性斗争。这个例子说明，党的组织真正成为一个有原则的集体，才能有效地实行集体领导。
    形式地实行集体领导，往往表现在某些党的委员对党委会所讨论的重大问题关心不够，特别是对于和自己没有直接关系的问题既不提出赞成的意见，也不提出反对的意见。这样，有些党的委员会在讨论问题时就形成了书记报告，委员旁听，书记决定，委员同意；或者是委员随便发表一些感想，表示一下态度，就马马虎虎地通过书记的决定。河北省交通厅党组就开了不少这样的会议。会前，党组织的成员就没有进行充分准备，会上，大家不能提出多少意见，于是许多重大决定，往往由主管单位就拟定的草稿向大家念一遍通过。中共湘潭市委会去年三月到今年四月虽然召开了六十七次市委会议，但因为会上没有充分展开讨论，因此许多重大的原则性的问题都没有得到完满的解决。所以产生这种情况是某些党委委员有着一些不正确的看法：有的认为一切问题最后总得要由正副书记来决定的，同时，也提不出好的意见，不如不提；有的则把党委书记和委员的关系看成是上下级的关系，书记决定了，委员就不能否决。有的则抱“事不关己，高高挂起”的态度，对与自己关系不大的问题就没有兴趣。要委员加强集体领导就必须克服这些不正确的想法，使他们对集体领导的原则有正确的认识。
    贯彻执行党的集体领导原则，就必须把集体领导和个人负责相结合。离开了个人负责制，集体领导也会变成一种形式。列宁曾经阐述过集体领导制和个人负责制的正确关系，他说：
    “稍一有可能时，集体领导制只应限于在最小范围的委员会内，最简短地来讨论唯一最重要的问题，而实际处理本机关、企业、人事、任务的责任，则应委给一个素以刚毅坚决果敢见称，长于处理实际问题，并享有最大信任的同志去担负。集体领导制无论如何而一无例外地都应与最确切规定每人对某一确定事务之个人负责制相辅而行。借集体领导制来掩盖的无人负责现象，是最危险的祸害，……”（“大家都去与邓尼金斗争”）
    现在，有些同志不是把集体领导和个人负责看成是相互结合的东西，而是看成是相互对立的东西。前面所说的，把个人负责变成个人独裁，取消了集体领导，这是一种情况。另一种情况则是把集体领导变成无人负责或者是害怕个人负责，事无巨细，一概都开会集体讨论，这样就妨碍了党的实际工作，造成工作中的拖拉，疲沓，不负责任。这种集体领导只会造就一些忙忙碌碌、辛辛苦苦的官僚主义者和事务主义者，只会培养一些开会专家和空谈家。河北广平县委过去就把许多细小的问题都提到全体委员会议上讨论通过。这样，不但增加了会议的次数，拖长了会议的时间，而且有少数县委委员和少数部门都因此不再去独立思考问题和独立处理问题，变成了“传声筒”“收发室”。真正的集体领导，决不是妨碍生动的实际工作；真正的集体领导，一定要和个人负责相结合。凡是有关重大的原则性和政策性的问题，无疑是要由集体来讨论决定的，但在执行的时候，都必须要有严格的分工；凡是有了明文规定的问题，或者不是有关重大的原则性和政策性的问题，应该按照分工由个人负责处理，这样作，既能加强集体领导，提高工作效率，又能充分发挥党委会全体成员的积极负责的精神。必须认识，无人负责和不敢负责是一种可怕的不良现象，允许这种现象的存在，一定会使实际工作遭到严重损失。
    要有效地实行党的集体领导原则，还必须健全党的会议制度。譬如说应当按照党章的规定，在一定时期举行党代表大会、代表会议、并定期举行党委会的全体会议和常委会议。在这些会议上既可以广泛地讨论和检查工作，又可以进行大胆的而又实事求是的批评和自我批评；经常地举行这些会议，就会使每个党员和党的干部经常感到要对党的事业负责，并且把自己的知识和经验毫无保留地贡献出来。实践的经验已经表明，坚持执行这种制度，便会大大地发挥集体领导的作用。福建省和山东省有些县委会就不大召开全体委员会，有的甚至连常委会议都不大召开，许多重大的原则性的问题，只是由县委书记和个别委员交换一下意见便擅自以党委会名义作出决定。这种现象应该认为是破坏集体领导原则的现象。只要坚持了集体领导的会议制度，就可以比较有效地防止这种破坏集体领导的行为。
