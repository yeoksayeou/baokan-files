Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, 28th - Nehru told the People's House on July 27th that the South Vietnamese government has so far not agreed to the requests made by the two chairmen of the Geneva Conference regarding the implementation of the Geneva Accords.

Nehru said that in April and May of this year, the two chairmen—Britain and the Soviet Union—thoroughly reviewed the issues related to the implementation of the Geneva Accords on Vietnam during several meetings held in London. Subsequently, they sent letters to the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the South Vietnamese government authorities, requesting them to: first, make every effort to implement the Geneva Accords on Vietnam; second, prevent any future violations of the military provisions of these accords; and third, guarantee the implementation of the political provisions and principles embodied in the final declaration of the Geneva Conference.

The Indian Prime Minister said that the two chairmen had requested both sides of Vietnam to jointly or separately inform them as soon as possible of their views on the time required to organize nationwide elections in Vietnam and the time required to hold elections as a means of achieving Vietnamese reunification.

Nehru mentioned that in another letter, the two chairmen informed the French government that they recognized that the dissolution of the General Headquarters of the French Union had caused some problems for the International Supervisory Commission, and they urged the French government to discuss this issue with the South Vietnamese authorities in order to reach an agreement that would facilitate the work of the Vietnamese International Supervisory Commission and the Joint Commission.

He said that the South Vietnamese government has not yet agreed to the requests made by the two chairmen, and the Indian government is constantly studying the developments in Indochina.

A member of parliament asked whether any suggestions had been made to hold a meeting of the countries participating in the Geneva Conference to consider the situation arising from the South Vietnamese government's refusal to implement the provisions of the Geneva Accords related to elections.

Nehru said: I believe that some vague suggestions have been made from time to time, but such suggestions have not been adopted, probably because it is not considered that the time is ripe to hold such a meeting.

    尼赫鲁在印度人民院说
    南越还未同意履行日内瓦协定
    新华社新德里28日电　尼赫鲁在七月二十七日告诉人民院说，南越政府到目前为止还没有同意日内瓦会议两位主席提出的关于履行日内瓦协定的要求。
    尼赫鲁说，今年四月和五月，两位主席——英国和苏联——在伦敦举行的几次会议期间详尽地审议了有关履行关于越南的日内瓦协定的问题。此后，他们致函越南民主共和国和南越政府当局，要求他们：第一，尽一切努力执行关于越南的日内瓦协定；第二，防止今后对这些协定的军事条款的任何违反；第三，保证执行体现在日内瓦会议最后宣言中的政治条款和原则。
    印度总理说，两位主席曾要求越南双方把他们对于就组织越南全国选举举行磋商所需要的时间以及举行作为达成越南统一的手段的选举所需要的时间的意见，共同地或者分别地尽快通知他们。
    尼赫鲁谈到两位主席在另一份函件中通知法国政府说，他们认识到，法兰西联邦总司令部的解散已经给国际监察委员会造成了一些问题，他们并且促请法国政府同南越当局讨论这个问题，以使达成将便利于越南国际监察委员会和联合委员会的工作的协议。
    他说，南越政府迄今没有同意两位主席提出的要求，印度政府经常在研究印度支那事态的发展。
    有议员问到是否提出过由参加日内瓦会议的国家举行会议来考虑由于南越政府拒绝执行日内瓦协定有关选举的条款所引起的局势的任何建议。
    尼赫鲁说：我相信曾经不时提出过一些含混的建议，但是这种建议并没有被采纳，大概是并不认为举行这种会议的时机已经成熟。
