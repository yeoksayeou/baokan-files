    How Should Agricultural Production Cooperatives Be Named?

    Our newspaper has received letters from some readers mentioning the names of agricultural production cooperatives and the titles of the leaders of these cooperatives. They wrote, saying: some are called advanced agricultural production cooperatives, others are called collective farms; some are called directors or heads, others are called farm leaders or chairmen; the names are not uniform, causing some misconceptions among some of the masses. Some people mistakenly believe that advanced cooperatives are not yet collective farms and will have to change in the future; some mistakenly believe that "chairman" or "farm leader" is "one level higher" than "director," and mistakenly believe that the positions of director and head are different. They ask: can a uniform regulation be made?

    We believe that the name agricultural production cooperative is already very good. It clearly shows that this organization is a cooperative organization with agricultural production as its content. Therefore, any agricultural production cooperative, after being transformed from a primary cooperative to an advanced cooperative, should still be called a certain agricultural production cooperative, and there is no need to change its name to a collective farm. It should be clearly explained to the masses that advanced agricultural production cooperatives are collective farms, and there is no difference between the two, and there is no need to rename them as collective farms in the future. There is also no need to add the word "advanced" to the names of specific agricultural production cooperatives. For example, "Happiness Agricultural Production Cooperative" does not need to be renamed "Happiness Advanced Agricultural Production Cooperative" after being transformed into an advanced cooperative. (Of course, it is acceptable to say, "Happiness Agricultural Production Cooperative is an advanced cooperative.") Because in a year or two, primary cooperatives will basically be transformed into advanced cooperatives; everyone is an advanced cooperative, and the word "advanced" becomes superfluous. In addition, those agricultural production cooperatives that have already been named "Certain Collective Farm" should also be renamed "Certain Agricultural Production Cooperative" in order to be consistent with the agricultural production cooperatives throughout the country. (When changing the name, it should be discussed and approved by the members' meeting, and it should not be decided arbitrarily by a few cadres, nor should it be arbitrarily designated by the higher-level leading organs.)

    According to the provisions of the "Model Charter for Agricultural Production Cooperatives" and the "Model Charter for Advanced Agricultural Production Cooperatives," the titles of the leading cadres of agricultural production cooperatives should all be called "Director" instead of "Head"; the top leaders of agricultural production cooperatives that have already been named collective farms should also preferably be uniformly called "Director" instead of "Farm Leader" or "Chairman."

### 农业生产合作社怎样定名？

    农业生产合作社怎样定名？
    本报收到一些读者来信，提到农业生产合作社名称和社的领导人员的职务名称问题。他们来信说：有的叫高级农业生产合作社，有的叫集体农庄；有的叫社长或主任，有的叫庄长或主席；名称不统一，在一部分群众中间造成了某些错觉。有些人误认为高级社还不是集体农庄，将来还要变；有些人误认为主席、庄长比主任“高一级”，误认为主任和社长的职位有所不同。他们问：是不是可以作出统一的规定呢？
    我们认为：农业生产合作社这个名称本来就很好。它清楚地表明了这种组织是以农业生产为内容的合作性质的组织。因此，任何一个农业生产合作社在由初级社转为高级社以后，应该仍然称为某某农业生产合作社，而不必改名为集体农庄。应该向群众解释清楚：高级农业生产合作社就是集体农庄，两者并没有什么区别，将来也没有必要再改称集体农庄。在各个具体的农业生产合作社的社名上面，也没有必要加上“高级”字样。如“幸福农业生产合作社”，在转成高级社以后不必改称“幸福高级农业生产合作社”。（当然，说“幸福农业生产合作社是一个高级社”，那是可以的。）因为在一、两年以后，初级社就基本上都转为高级社了；大家都是高级社，“高级”二字就成为多余的了。此外，那些已经命名为“某某集体农庄”的农业生产合作社，为了同全国的农业生产合作社取得一致，最好也改称为“某某农业生产合作社”。（改变名称的时候，应该经社员大会讨论通过，不可由少数干部擅自决定，也不可由上级领导机关随意指定。）
    农业生产合作社的领导干部的职务名称，按照“农业生产合作社示范章程”和“高级农业生产合作社示范章程”的规定，应该一律叫“主任”，而不叫“社长”；那些已经命名为集体农庄的农业生产合作社的总领导人，最好也统一称为“主任”，而不称“庄长”或“主席”。
