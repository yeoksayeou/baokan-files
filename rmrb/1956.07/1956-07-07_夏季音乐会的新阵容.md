    New Lineup for Summer Concerts
    (Our newspaper dispatch) The seventh summer music and dance evening party, which will be held at the Labor Theater on the evening of the 7th, will feature the participation of the Beijing Municipal People's Committee Organ Chorus. This chorus is composed of more than 90 music enthusiasts from various municipal organs. The chorus members include commercial workers, planning workers, public security cadres, bank cadres, secretaries, statisticians, nurses, engineers...
    The cultural and recreational activities of the capital's organs are becoming more and more active year by year. On weekends or holidays, in addition to movies, dances, ball games, and other activities, amateur drama troupes from the organs often perform dramas, Peking operas, or music and dance programs for comrades in their own systems and units. This is the first time that amateur art groups composed of organ workers have participated in formal public performances. It demonstrates the development of amateur cultural and artistic activities in the capital. In addition, several other amateur choirs and dance troupes composed of teachers, university and middle school students, and children will also participate in the music and dance evening parties for the first time this summer.
    Workers, students, and office staff are both audience members and performers. The music and dance evening parties held every summer enrich the cultural life of the working people in the capital. (Gang)
