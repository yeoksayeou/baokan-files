Xinhua News Agency, Baoji, July 15th: Construction began on July 6th in the Baoji area on China's first hub station for both electric and steam locomotives.

	This hub station is located in the center of Baoji City, beside the Jinling River. The station is large in scale, with a planned track layout about twice the size of the current Baoji station. Because electric locomotives will operate on the Baoji-to-Fengzhou section of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway in the future, the hub station will include special buildings such as an electric locomotive depot and a traction substation. Various colored electric interlocking signals and contact networks will be erected along the line. The station's other equipment is designed to accommodate the simultaneous use of both electric and steam locomotives.

	The Baoji-Chengdu Railway has been fully connected, and the number of trains passing through the Baoji area will greatly increase in the future. The existing Baoji station's track and equipment are no longer adequate. In order to improve transportation efficiency, the railway department has decided to build a large train marshalling yard in the Baoji area to handle the arrival, departure, and classification of freight cars. The existing Baoji station will also be appropriately renovated to specialize in passenger transport services in the future.

	Once the Baoji hub station is completed, petroleum from the Northwest, grain, medicinal materials, and local specialties from the Southwest, cotton and wheat from the Guanzhong Plain in Shaanxi, and machinery and industrial equipment from North China – goods from all parts of the country – will be re-sorted here before being transported in batches to various destinations.

    宝鸡兴建电气蒸汽机车枢纽站
    据新华社宝鸡15日电　我国第一座电气机车和蒸汽机车两用的枢纽站，六日在宝鸡地区动工兴建。
    这个枢纽车站的位置，在宝鸡市中心，旁靠金陵河畔。车站的规模较大，计划辅设的轨道比现在宝鸡车站约多一倍。由于宝成铁路宝鸡到凤州段将来要行驶电气机车，因此在这个枢纽站内，将设立电气机车库、牵引变电所等特种建筑，沿线还要架设各种颜色的电气闭塞信号和接触线网；站上的其他的设备，在设计当中都考虑到了电气和蒸汽机车可同时使用的这个特点。
    宝成铁路已经全线接轨，今后通过宝鸡地区的列车将大大增加，现有宝鸡车站站场设备已经不能适应需要。为了提高运输效率，因此铁道部门决定在宝鸡地区新建一个大的列车调车场，办理货车到发和编组业务；现有的宝鸡车站，也将适当进行改建，将来专门担任客运业务。
    宝鸡枢纽车站建成以后，西北的石油，西南的粮食、药材和土特产，陕西关中平原的棉花、小麦，华北的机器、工业器材：来自祖国四面八方的物资，将经过这里重新进行编组作业，然后再分批运往各地。
