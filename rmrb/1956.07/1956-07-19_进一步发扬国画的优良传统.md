Following the wise and correct policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend" put forward by the Party and Chairman Mao to the national cultural circles, the Second National Exhibition of Chinese Painting opened in the Exhibition Hall of the Chinese Artists Association. Due to the limited capacity of the exhibition hall, this exhibition did not include all the selected works, so that many excellent works could not meet the people of the capital, which is very regrettable. Judging from the works selected this time, the brilliant flowers of Chinese painting are blooming, and it is developing along the correct path of weeding through the old to bring forth the new. I don't intend to introduce this aspect one by one, but only talk about some individual problems that I have experienced from this art exhibition.

Generally speaking, the achievements of this exhibition are most prominent in Beijing and Shanghai. Painters in Beijing have always had better conditions, close to the classical painting heritage, and also have a tradition of learning the history of the heritage. Therefore, in the use of traditional techniques, most of them show their profound cultivation, but the creative thinking is relatively conservative, which is the general situation, not referring to a specific work. Most of the works in Shanghai can give people a fresh feeling, but after careful analysis, this freshness is not formed by the transformation of personal creative thinking, but only from the difference between the different styles of Shanghai painters and Beijing painters in the past 100 years, so in the final analysis, it is still the continuation of the old style, and it still needs to be greatly improved from cultivation to create a truly new style. In terms of inheriting the heritage, the painters in Suzhou have indeed done better than those in Shanghai, preserving more excellent techniques (the "preservation" here refers to critically using traditional techniques, not saying that the more conservative, the better).

I have cited these two regions for comparison above, because they are more representative. Of course, the works in other regions also have their own different styles, their own advantages and unique features. I'll leave it for later. Next, I would like to propose a few works for a comparison: In terms of landscape painting, the most heavily inked exhibits are Yan Di's "Mount Emei" and Li Keran's "Fishing Village after Rain." Comrade Yan Di originally studied Western painting and is now engaged in the study of Chinese painting; Li Keran is a professor in the "Color Ink Department" of the Central Academy of Fine Arts. From the perspective of ink color, these two paintings are very strong, and they are both depicting smoke, clouds and rain. Yan's painting is pleasing to the eye at first glance and in detail. Li's painting seems to have momentum from a distance, but it is empty when viewed up close. The so-called emptiness means that there is no "brush and ink". He simply uses ink to do some superficial rendering and smearing, pursuing surface effects. Such a creation is of course not durable. In the venue, I heard an audience member say, "With the same black, I would rather take Yan Di's." This is naturally the meaning. I am pointing this out now to illustrate the importance of recognizing the cultivation and practice in inheriting and developing the heritage. In terms of figure painting, Fang Zengxian's "Every Grain is Hard Earned" has been printed as a New Year picture and has been popular for a while; similar to him is Tang Wenxuan's "No Matter What, I Want to Join the Commune." Here, I won't say how the latter expresses the theme content. Now, comparing it with Fang's painting, Fang's painting has a lively composition, and Tang's painting has better facial expressions, but the overall composition is simple, which is inferior to Fang's painting; but from the perspective of line structure, Tang's technique is still more skilled.

I have talked about the differences in the styles of works in Shanghai and Beijing before, and now I will further summarize the landscapes and flowers and birds from various regions to compare with the works in Beijing. In terms of landscape painting, most of the works from various places reflect real life, which is good, but the disadvantage is that most of them inevitably approximate the documentary expression method, and the artistry is insufficient. As for flowers and birds, whether meticulous or freehand, they are not as good as those in Beijing. In Beijing, freehand paintings such as Wang Xuetao, Wang Shishen, and Guo Weiqu's works, and meticulous paintings such as Tian Shiguang and Yu Zhizhen's works, all have their own unique features.

In addition, the most important work in the exhibition is Li Xiongcai's "Wuhan Flood Control Map" long scroll. This painting not only reflects the great spirit of the people of the new society overcoming difficulties with collective strength, but also successfully used the traditional techniques of Chinese painting. It not only explains the theme, but also enhances the beauty of the picture. This is the beauty of national style loved by our broad masses of people, and there is no foreign atmosphere. In the whole picture, he uses dry brush as the main, rendering as the subordinate, with sparse and dense interspersed, light and heavy appropriate. He does not let trivial things affect the entire picture. When dealing with the overall situation, he can focus on the overall effect and relax the management of the local. The application is subtle, the real is dense like sparse, the lifting is light like heavy, and it seems sparse but real dense. He is so freely expressing life from the foundation of Chinese painting. I would like to emphasize: The power poles and wires that he used dry brush and charred ink to sweep quickly on the screen not only do not feel stiff, but also can enhance the artistic effect of the picture. Some people say that the method he used to deal with the connection of two different realms in this painting is to use clumps of trees to connect them, which seems close to the same. However, according to my careful observation, not only did I not find this problem, but I felt that the several sections of trees he painted played the effect of a musical rhythm. We can separately take these several sections of trees as the center and extend a section to both sides, and then observe the whole, it can answer us, they are a good picture of a section, and each has its own composition chapter, which is enough to prove that there is no dead method, dead set of tree connections. As for the shortcomings, I think the requirements for such an excellent writer may as well be stricter. I think his cultivation of the leaf dots of the clumps of trees is not enough, so that some places appear cluttered and stiff. Although this is a minor flaw, it should still be noted. Another painting worth discussing is Hu Ruosi's "Guilin Landscape". This painting is also a relatively prominent one in this exhibition, and many people feel fresh, but after careful research, he just moved some of the ancient people's established methods in a certain period. These are some immature methods of the ancients. We should not mechanically apply the established methods of the ancients, and we should not move the immature methods of the ancients. We should use it as a basis to use, then we should only use it better and more lively. We can make an analogy. Zhan Ziqian's "Spring Outing" is very valuable from a historical point of view, but today's new creations by painters to draw a "Spring Outing" that is very similar to Zhan Ziqian's has no meaning, and there is no creativity at all.

The above is from some key works on display. As for the common shortcomings, according to what I have seen in the current exhibition and in the selection, there are about several items summarized: In terms of figure painting, some people use photographic means to carry out so-called new creations. The paintings have no characteristics of Chinese painting, but are somewhat like publicity posters. In landscape paintings, there are many that reflect the new life, but most of them are realistic records of life, drawing everything seen in the eyes, without leaving any detail, and there is no artistic processing. In addition, some creative ideas are very good, and the expression is also very vivid, but unfortunately the nutrition from the heritage is not enough and needs to be strengthened. I think the cultivation of the theoretical foundation and technical foundation of Chinese painting is very necessary. In the exhibited works, some painters in some areas are limited by objective reasons and use foreign paper, pattern colors and watercolor colors, which are countless. These all affect the certain effect of the picture. Even in Shanghai, where there are sufficient Chinese painting pigments, Comrade Hu Ruosi actually used pattern colors in "Guilin Landscape". This not only makes the painting less colorful, but also fades after being blown and exposed to the sun for a few days. This point should also be considered. Speaking of this, it should be pointed out to the relevant departments producing Chinese painting materials and tools that the quality of paper, silk, pigments, brushes and ink is very poor now, and some places cannot buy them. This problem must be solved. The Party and Chairman Mao have further clarified the policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom" in literature and art, giving great encouragement to national Chinese painters. It is deeply believed that Chinese painting will be developed and prospered more rapidly under the guidance of this wise and correct policy. We have seen the scene of a hundred flowers blooming in this art exhibition, but some flowers are not blooming well enough. Therefore, I hope that national Chinese painters will further go deep into life and learn from the heritage, so that the excellent traditions of Chinese painting can be truly carried forward!

### 进一步发扬国画的优良传统

    进一步发扬国画的优良传统
    徐燕荪
    紧接着党和毛主席向全国文化界提出了“百花齐放、百家争鸣”这一英明正确方针之后，第二届全国国画展览会在中国美术家协会展览馆开幕了。这次展出限于陈列室的容量，没有包括入选作品的全部，以致不少优秀作品都未能与首都人民见面，这是非常遗憾的。从这次选的作品来看，国画的灿烂花朵正在开放，它是遵循着推陈出新的正确途径发展的，关于这方面我不打算逐一地介绍，只就我个人从这次画展中所体会到的个别问题来谈一下。
    总括起来看，这次展出的成绩以北京和上海两个地区为最突出，北京的画家从来就有较好的条件，接近古典绘画遗产，也有学习遗产历史的传统，因此在运用传统技法上，大都显示出他们的湛深的修养，不过创作思想较近于保守，这是一般的情况，不是指某一件具体作品而言。上海方面大部分能给人以新鲜的感觉，但是仔细分析，这种新鲜并非是由于个人创作思想的转变所形成的，而只是从近百年来上海画家和北京画家历来不同的风格的差异给人的感觉，所以归根结底还是旧的风格的继续，仍有待于从修养中大大地提高，创造真正的新的风格。从对遗产的继承来说，苏州的画家倒的确比上海做得好些，保存较多的优秀技法（这里所说“保存”是指批判地运用传统技法，并非说愈保守就愈好）。
    上面我举了这两个地区来做比较，因为是较有代表性，当然其他地区的作品，也各自有它不同的风调，各自有其优点和独到之处。且留在后面再说，下面我想提出几件作品试来做一番对照：山水方面，展品中墨色浓重的要数颜地的“峨嵋山”和李可染的“雨后渔村”。颜地同志原习西画，现在从事国画的钻研；李可染是中央美术学院“彩墨科”的教授。这两幅画从墨色来看，都是十分浓重，都在刻划烟云雨气，颜的画粗看和细看全都耐看，李的画远看仿佛也有气势，近观却空无一物。所谓空无一物，也就是说没有“笔墨”，他单纯运用水墨做一些肤浅的烘染涂抹，追求表面效果，这样的创作当然是不耐看的。在会场中听到一位观众说：“一样的黑，我宁取颜地”，自然也是这个意思。我现在指出这一点，正为说明我们在继承和发扬遗产中，要认识到修养实践的重要性。人物方面，方增先的“粒粒皆辛苦”，已印年画，风行一时；和他大致相似的还有汤文选的“说什么我也要入社”。在这里我不说后者对主题内容表现的如何，现在将他和方画对照一下，方画构图生动，汤画人面的表情较好，而整个构图近于平易，是不及方画处；但从线条结构来看，则汤的技术还熟练些。
    我前面曾谈过上海和北京的作品风格的差异，现在再进一步概括地把各个地区的山水和花鸟来和北京作品对照一下。山水方面，各地作品反映现实生活的较多，这是好的，但缺点是多数不免近似纪录性的表现方法，艺术性不足。至于花鸟则无论工笔、写意都不如北京，北京，写意如王雪涛、汪慎生、郭味蕖的作品，工笔如田世光、俞致贞的作品，都有他们的独到之处。
    此外，展出作品中最使我重视的是黎雄才画的“武汉防汛图”长卷，他这幅画，既反映了新社会人民以集体的力量克服困难的伟大气魄，同时还成功地运用了国画传统的技法，不止说明了主题，并且是增助了画面上的美丽，这是为我们广大人民群众所爱好的民族风格的美丽，找不出舶来的气息。在全幅画中，他用渴笔为主，烘染为从，疏密相间，轻重适宜，他不以琐碎事物影响整个画面，在处理全局时能着重整体效果而放松了局部的经营，运用微妙，实密似疏，举重若轻，似疏实密，他是如何地从国画基础上运用自如的表现生活。我特别提出：他在画面上用渴笔焦墨迅扫而成的电杆电线，不但不觉生硬，而且能增强画面的艺术效果。有人说他在这幅画中处理两个不同境界的连系方法，都是用丛树来衔接，似近雷同，可是据我个人仔细地观察，不但没有找出这个毛病，转而觉得他所画的几段丛树，都起着如乐章的节奏的效果，我们可以分别地以这几段丛树各为中心分向两边伸展一段，再整个的观察一下，它可以回答我们，它们是一段一段的好画面，而各自具有各一段落的构图章法，这就足以证明它没有丛树衔接的死方法、死套子。至于缺点方面，我认为对这样一位优秀作家的要求，还是不妨严一些，我觉得他对丛树的点叶的修养功还不够，以致有几处显得杂乱板滞，这虽属于小疵微眚，还是应当注意为是。另外值得讨论的一幅是胡若思的“桂林山水”，这幅画在本届展览中，也是比较突出的一幅，也很有人感觉新鲜，但经仔细研究，他仅仅是搬运了些古人某一时期的成法，这是古人未成熟的一些方法，我们不应机械地套古人的成法，更不应该搬运古人这种不成熟的方法，我们要以它为基础来运用，那么只应该运用得更好更生动有进展才是。我们可以做个比喻，展子虔的“游春图”，从历史上来看，是很值得珍贵的，但是今天的画家的新创作，要再画一个十分类似展子虔的“游春图”，就没有什么意义了，而且根本谈不到什么创造性。
    以上是从展出的一些重点作品来说，至于共同缺点，根据现在展出和在评选中所看到的，归纳起来约有几项：在人物画方面，有人用摄影性的手段进行所谓新的创作，画出来没有国画的特点，倒有些像宣传招贴画。在山水风景画中，反映新生活的也很多，但多半都是生活的如实纪录，把眼中所见事物，应有尽有，些微不遗地画上，谈不到艺术加工。再则有些创作构思很好，表现也很生动，但可惜汲取遗产的营养不够，还需加强。对国画的理论基础和技法基础的修养，我认为这是非常必要的，在展出作品中，有些地区的画家，受到客观原因的限制，使用洋纸，使用图案色和水彩色的，更是指不胜屈，这些都影响了画面的一定效果，甚至如上海地区，本有充足的国画颜料，而胡若思同志竟在“桂林山水”中使用了图案色，这一来不独使画减色，同时几经风日吹晒，便会褪色，这一点也是应该考虑的。说到这里，应该提请有关国画材料工具生产部门注意，现在纸绢颜料笔墨的质量都很差，而且有的地方却买不到，这个问题必须解决。党和毛主席进一步明确文艺上“百花齐放”的方针，给予全国国画家以极大的鼓舞，深信国画在这个英明正确的方针指引下，必将得到更迅速的发展和繁荣。我们在这次画展中已看到了百花盛开的景象，但有些花开得还不够好，因此希望全国国画家们，更进一步深入生活，学习遗产，使国画的优良传统，得以真正的发扬光大！
