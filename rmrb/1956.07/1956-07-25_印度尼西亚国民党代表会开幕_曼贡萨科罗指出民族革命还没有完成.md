Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, July 23rd: According to a Semarang dispatch: The eighth national congress of the Indonesian Nationalist Party (PNI), the largest ruling party in Indonesia, opened yesterday in Semarang.

    In his opening address, Mangunsarkoro, acting chairman of the Indonesian Nationalist Party, spoke of how the government's instability and the chaos in domestic social order in the past decade had seriously hampered the country's economic construction. He said that after the general election, new hopes had emerged, and this hope had been strengthened by the current cabinet's progressive platform being supported by all social forces in the country.

    Mangunsarkoro believes that whether the current cabinet can become a stable government with the potential to realize its program depends on whether the ruling parties can cooperate well, especially whether the three major parties can cooperate.

    The Indonesian Nationalist Party leader said that the Indonesian national revolution has not yet been completed, because the ideal of establishing a state based on the Pantja Sila (the five principles on which Indonesia was founded) has yet to be realized, and West Irian is still under Dutch rule, and some groups even want to replace the Pantja Sila with something else.

    When talking about the struggle to recover West Irian, Mangunsarkoro said that after the abolition of the Round Table Conference Agreement, "we are no longer bound by anything and can make efforts to fight for the return of this territory to our republic." He believes that the current political atmosphere is conducive to re-submitting the West Irian issue to the United Nations. Mangunsarkoro said that the United Nations is an appropriate place to resolve the West Irian issue, "but if the United Nations is once again used as a stage for political tricks or as a tool for imperialist countries to oppress other people, then the situation will be different." He said: "In order to recover West Irian, we cannot rely solely on the struggle in the United Nations."

    About 1,500 representatives from all over the country attended the opening meeting, including Prime Minister Sastroamidjojo and the ministers of the Indonesian Nationalist Party in the current cabinet.

    印度尼西亚国民党代表会开幕
    曼贡萨科罗指出民族革命还没有完成
    据新华社雅加达23日电　据三宝垄消息：印度尼西亚最大的执政党印度尼西亚国民党的第八次全国代表大会昨天在三宝垄开幕。
    印度尼西亚国民党代理主席曼贡萨科罗在致开幕词的时候谈到了在过去十年中政府的不稳定和国内社会秩序的混乱严重地妨害了国家的经济建设。他说，在大选以后，新的希望出现了，这种希望由于现内阁的进步的政纲受到国内所有社会力量的支持而得到加强。
    曼贡萨科罗认为，现内阁是否能成为拥有实现它的纲领的潜在力量的稳定的政府，要看各执政党是否能进行良好的合作，特别是三个大党是否能进行合作。
    这位印度尼西亚国民党领袖说，印度尼西亚民族革命还没有完成，因为建立五基（印度尼西亚建国的五项原则）国家的理想还有待实现，而西伊里安还在荷兰统治之下，有些集团甚至想以别的东西来代替五基。
    曼贡萨科罗在谈到关于收回西伊里安的斗争的时候说，在废除了圆桌会议协定以后，“我们就不再受什么拘束，可以进行努力为争取这一块领土归还我们共和国而斗争”。他认为，目前的政治气氛有利于向联合国重新提出西伊里安问题。曼贡萨科罗说，联合国是解决西伊里安问题的适当场所，“如果联合国再次被当作玩弄政治把戏的舞台或者被当作帝国主义国家压迫别国人民的工具来利用，那末，情况就会不同了。”他说：“为了收复西伊里安，我们不能够单单依靠在联合国所进行的斗争。”
    参加开幕会议的有来自全国各地的大约一千五百名代表，其中包括沙斯特罗阿米佐约总理和印度尼西亚国民党在现内阁的各部长。
