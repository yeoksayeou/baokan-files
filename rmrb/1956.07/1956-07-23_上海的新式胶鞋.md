Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai Electric Dispatch: Micro-porous sponge rubber-soled women's sandals. These sandals use micro-porous sponge rubber in colors such as pink, sky blue, and milky white for the soles, matched with various colors of harmonious hollowed-out cloth uppers. The style is beautiful, and they are light and soft to wear. These women's sandals were recently successfully trial-produced by Hongda Rubber Factory.

The track and field shoes worn by athletes were trial-produced by Zhengtai Rubber Factory based on the requirements put forward by the athletes. They are one-third lighter than tennis shoes, and the soles are one-quarter thinner than ordinary rubber shoes, but the rubber content is higher than ordinary shoes, so they feel particularly light and soft to wear. The upper is sewn with a whole piece of cloth, which is relatively strong. These shoes are now in mass production.

Foldable leather shoe overshoes that can be hidden in a raincoat pocket are a new product of Dachina Rubber Factory. The upper and sole of these overshoes are very thin. They are manufactured according to the popular leather shoe styles on the market, without a cloth bottom, with high rubber content and great elasticity. They are worn outside the leather shoes on rainy days, and they are very light to walk in.

In the first half of this year, Shanghai's rubber factories have also successfully trial-produced new rubber shoe products, including white canvas shoes for the Dai people, youth shoes sold to the Nanyang Islands area, highly elastic porous sponge sneakers, and various colors of women's bow-tie rubber shoes.

    运动员穿的田径鞋，是正泰橡胶厂根据运动员提出的要求试制的。它的重量比网球鞋轻三分之一，鞋底比普通胶鞋薄四分之一，而含胶量比普通鞋高，所以穿起来感到特别轻便柔软。鞋面是用整块布缝制的，比较结实。现在这种鞋子已经大批生产了。
    可以折叠起来藏在雨衣口袋里的皮鞋套鞋，是大中华橡胶厂的新产品。这种套鞋的鞋面和鞋底都很薄。它是按照市场上流行的皮鞋式样制造的，没有布底子，含胶量高，弹性大，下雨天套在皮鞋的外面穿，走起路来非常轻便。
    今年上半年，上海的橡胶工厂试制成功的胶鞋新产品，还有供傣族人民穿的白帆布鞋、运往南洋群岛一带销售的青年鞋、弹性很大的多孔海绵球鞋和各种颜色的女式蝴蝶结胶鞋等。
