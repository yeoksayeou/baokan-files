    To implement the State Council's instructions on developing pig raising, the Ministry of Commerce of the People's Republic of China has appropriately increased hog procurement prices in certain regions; after the hog procurement price is increased, the pork sales price will not be increased accordingly. It is estimated that in the second half of this year, farmers raising pigs in areas where hog procurement prices are low will increase their income by approximately 40 million yuan. This is an important measure to increase farmers' enthusiasm for raising pigs.
    In the past few years, the hog procurement prices in most regions have generally been appropriate and beneficial to farmers' pig raising. Judging from the annual hog production figures, the hog production volume in 1952 was 84.9 million heads, 94.3 million heads in 1953, and 100 million heads in 1954. The hog production volume has been increasing year by year, greatly exceeding the pre-war level of 63.68 million heads in 1937. Hog production decreased to around 90 million heads in 1955, which was due to the severe flooding in 1954 and a period of food supply tensions in the spring of 1955. Hog production is currently recovering this year, and if the work is done well, it may reach or slightly exceed the 1954 level. From 1952 to the present, hog procurement prices have also been gradually increasing; not only is the amount gradually increasing, but the comparison with local grain prices is also gradually increasing. Taking Taizhou, Jiangsu as an example, the hog procurement price in 1952 was 25.93 yuan per 100 jin, and the local rice price was 10.59 yuan per 100 jin, with each jin of hog equivalent to 2.45 jin of rice; the current hog procurement price is 31.5 yuan per 100 jin, and the local rice price is 10.73 yuan per 100 jin, with each jin of hog equivalent to 2.94 jin of rice. This is not only the case in Taizhou, but also in the major pig-producing areas across the country, such as Huaiyin in Jiangsu, Hefei in Anhui, Jinhua in Zhejiang, Wuzhou in Guangxi, Dingxian in Hebei, and Jinan in Shandong.
    Since hog procurement prices have been beneficial to the development of hog production over the years, why is it necessary to appropriately increase hog procurement prices now? There are two reasons for this.
    The first reason is that the difference between hog procurement prices and pork sales prices is relatively large in some places. Commercial departments and supply and marketing cooperatives buy hogs, slaughter them, and sell the meat to consumers locally, making a higher profit. Farmers feel that it is more cost-effective to slaughter and sell pork themselves. Farmers in these areas are dissatisfied with the state procurement agencies and are even reluctant to sell hogs to them.
    There are two ways to solve this problem: one is to increase the hog procurement price, and the other is to lower the local pork sales price. Comparing the two methods, the first method is better. This year, the national pork supply is insufficient. Increasing the procurement price can greatly increase farmers' enthusiasm for raising pigs. According to the regulations of the Ministry of Commerce, in areas where the difference between hog procurement prices and pork sales prices is relatively large, the procurement price of each hog will be increased by more than one yuan to one yuan and five jiao, while the sales price will remain unchanged. This is conducive to solving the problem of excessively large purchase and sale price differences.
    The second reason is that hog procurement prices are low in some remote areas with inconvenient transportation. The vast majority of farmers in our country raise pigs. Although there are several major pig-producing areas in the country, the vast majority of pigs are still produced dispersedly in various places. The pigs produced in remote areas often exceed local needs, and farmers request the state to purchase them and transport them to sales areas to supply the people's needs. The prices at which commercial departments and supply and marketing cooperatives purchase hogs in remote areas are basically determined according to the sales price minus the transportation costs. Hogs are a bulky commodity, and transportation costs are high, and there are inevitable losses due to death. Therefore, when the sales price is extrapolated to the production area price, the hog procurement price in remote areas is low. Now, the state is prepared to allocate a sum of money to subsidize the transportation costs of hogs in remote areas, so that the hog procurement price in remote areas can be increased somewhat. If only small accounts are considered, state-owned commerce will of course suffer a little loss by doing so, but if large accounts are considered, the enthusiasm of farmers in remote areas for raising pigs will be increased, and the national meat supply situation will be improved, which is beneficial to the people of the whole country.
    The above is what should be resolved immediately regarding the current hog procurement prices. In addition to these two issues, there is an even more important issue, that is, when farmers were operating individually, they did not calculate the labor remuneration for sideline products, but after agricultural cooperation, the situation has changed, and the level of labor remuneration has become the standard for agricultural production cooperatives and members to choose this or that sideline occupation. This will not only affect the price of hogs, but also the price of various rural by-products. Regarding this issue, as the State Council's instructions stated, commercial and agricultural departments should conduct thorough investigations, conduct comprehensive research, propose plans, and resolve it. However, until now, most advanced agricultural production cooperatives have not yet undergone the autumn harvest and autumn harvest distribution, and commercial and agricultural departments are not yet aware of the distribution situation of agricultural production cooperatives after this autumn. Therefore, they should start from now until after the autumn harvest distribution, and conduct detailed and comprehensive investigations and research within a few months, and must not resolve this issue hastily. The procurement price and sales price of commodities must be subordinate to the production cost of the commodity. If the production cost increases, and the procurement price and sales price are not increased accordingly, it will inevitably hit production, and the result will also affect supply. However, if the production cost is improperly estimated and the price is raised arbitrarily, it will also stimulate the blind development of rural sideline occupations and will affect the stability of commodity prices in the urban market.
    Commercial departments have made achievements in managing hogs over the years. However, some places have reported that the phenomenon of excessive deduction of weight and price depression in procurement still occurs constantly, and farmers are extremely dissatisfied. The procurement of agricultural and sideline products should be fair and reasonable. Good products should be given high prices, and poor products should be given low prices. Appropriate weight deductions can be made for pigs that are full and have large bellies, but the deductions must be reasonable and must not cause farmers to suffer losses. Wherever farmers have opinions on the state procurement agencies regarding weight deductions, the persons in charge of the commercial departments should inspect the work of the procurement agencies, personally consult with the leaders of the agricultural production cooperatives, explore a correct measurement method, and repeatedly educate all purchasing personnel and farmers.

### 适当提高生猪收购价格

    适当提高生猪收购价格
    中华人民共和国商业部为了执行国务院关于发展养猪的指示，适当地提高了某些地区的生猪收购价格；生猪收购价提高以后，猪肉销售价并不随同提高。估计在今年下半年，生猪收购价偏低地区的养猪的农民，将因此增加大约四千万元的收入。这是提高农民养猪的积极性的一项重要措施。
    过去几年，多数地区的生猪收购价格一般是合适的，对农民养猪是有利的。从历年生猪的生产数字来看，1952年生猪的生产量是八千四百九十万头，1953年是九千四百三十万头，1954年是一亿头，生猪生产量逐年上升，大大超过了抗战以前的1937年六千三百六十八万头的水平。1955年生猪产量降到九千万头左右，这是因为1954年遭了大水灾，1955年春季一度发生粮食供应紧张现象。今年生猪生产正在恢复，如果工作做得好，可能达到或者略略超过1954年的水平。从1952年到现在，生猪收购价格也在逐步提高；不仅金额是逐步提高的，和当地的粮价对比也是逐步提高的。举江苏泰州为例，1952年生猪收购价是每百斤25.93元，当地米价是每百斤10.59元，每斤生猪合2.45斤米；目前的生猪收购价是每百斤31.5元，当地米价是每百斤10.73元，每斤生猪合2.94斤米。不仅泰州一个地方是这样，全国的主要产猪区，例如江苏的淮阴，安徽的合肥，浙江的金华，广西的梧州，河北的定县，山东的济南等地的情形也是这样。
    既然历年来生猪收购价格是对发展生猪生产有利的，那末，为什么现在还要适当地提高生猪收购价格呢？这里有两方面的原因。
    第一个原因，是有些地方生猪收购价格和猪肉销售价格差额较大。商业部门和供销合作社把生猪买来杀了，在当地把肉卖给消费者，利润较高，农民觉得不如自己杀猪卖肉合算。这些地方的农民对国家的收购机关不满意，甚至不大愿意把生猪卖给收购机关。
    解决这个问题的办法有两个：一个是提高生猪收购价，一个是降低当地猪肉销售价。两个办法比较起来，第一个办法要好些。今年全国猪肉供应不足，提高收购价格，能够大大提高农民的养猪积极性。根据商业部的规定，在生猪收购价和猪肉销售价相差偏大的地方，每头生猪的收购价格将提高一元至一元五角以上，销售价不变。这是有利于解决购销差价偏大问题的。
    第二个原因，是有些交通不便的偏僻地区，生猪收购价格偏低。我国绝大多数农民都养猪，虽然全国有几个主要产猪区，但是绝大多数的猪还是在各地分散生产的。偏僻地区生产的猪，常常超过当地的需要，农民要求国家收购，运到销地供应人民需要。商业部门和供销合作社在偏僻地区收购生猪的价格，基本上是按照销地价格减去调运费用确定的。生猪是一种笨重的商品，调运费用很大，而且难免发生死亡的损失，因此，由销地价格推算到产地价格，偏僻地区的生猪收购价就偏低了。现在，国家已经准备拿出一笔钱来贴补偏僻地区的生猪调运费用，使偏僻地区的生猪收购价提高一些。这样作，如果只算小帐，国营商业当然会受一点损失，但是算起大帐来，偏僻地区的农民的养猪积极性提高了，全国肉类的供应状况改善了，这对全国人民是有利的。
    上面说的是目前生猪收购价格上应当立即解决的问题。除了这两个问题以外，还有一个更加重要的问题，就是农民在个体经营的时候，并不计算副业产品的劳动报酬，但在农业合作化以后，情况已经发生变化，劳动报酬的高低，已成为农业生产合作社和社员选择这种副业或那种副业的标准了。这不仅要影响到生猪的价格，而且要影响到农村各种副产品的价格。对于这个问题，正如国务院的指示所说的，应当由商业部门和农业部门切实调查，通盘研究，提出方案，加以解决。但是，到现在为止，大多数高级农业生产合作社还没有经过秋收和秋收分配，商业部门和农业部门对于今年秋后农业生产合作社的分配情况还不摸底。因此，它们应该从现在开始，直到秋收分配以后，在几个月的时间以内，进行详细的、全面的调查研究，决不可以草率从事地解决这个问题。商品的收购价格和销售价格必须服从商品的生产成本，如果生产成本提高了，收购价格和销售价格不作相应的提高，势必打击生产，结果也将影响供应。但如果对生产成本估计不当，随意提高价格，也将刺激农村副业的盲目发展，并将影响城市市场物价的稳定。
    商业部门经营生猪，几年来是有成绩的。但是，有些地方反映，在收购中扣秤过多、压级压价的现象还不断发生，农民极不满意。收购农副产品要公平合理，好的给大价钱，次的给小价钱，对饱食大肚猪可以适当的扣秤，但一定要扣得合理，绝不能使农民吃亏，凡是农民在扣秤方面对国家收购机关有意见的地方，商业部门的负责人就应该检查收购机关的工作，亲自和农业生产合作社的领导人员进行协商，探讨一种正确的计量方法，并向全体采购人员和农民反复地进行教育。
