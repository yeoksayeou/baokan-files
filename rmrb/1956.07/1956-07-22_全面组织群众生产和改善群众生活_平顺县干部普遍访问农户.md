Comprehensively Organize Mass Production and Improve Mass Living Standards
Ping Shun County Cadres Universally Visit Farm Households
    (Our newspaper's Taiyuan dispatch on the 21st) Cadres from 49 townships and 184 agricultural production cooperatives in Ping Shun County, Shanxi Province, are universally visiting more than 29,000 farm households throughout the county to help cooperative members of agricultural production cooperatives solve urgent difficulties in their daily lives.

    In January of this year, the Ping Shun County Committee of the Communist Party of China organized a visiting delegation to conduct door-to-door surveys in the impoverished mountainous areas of Hongtiguan, Yuxiakou and eighteen other townships. The visiting delegation saw that although the masses in these areas had enough to eat and wear, they still faced many difficulties in life and production due to the limitations of the natural conditions in the mountains. For example, the masses could not find firewood or buy coal; the narrow and slippery paths winding around the cliffs were difficult to walk on, and unfortunate incidents of people and animals falling and dying occurred every year; people lived with livestock and poultry, the stoves in the houses had no chimneys, and washing vegetables, laundry, and drinking water were all done in an open-air pool; medical institutions were unsound, and it was difficult to find doctors; more than 90% of the people were illiterate, and many people lived to be seventy or eighty years old without seeing a play; wolves constantly ate people and livestock; and living was very dispersed, with isolated villages and households, which caused great difficulties in production and life.

    After making this visit, the Ping Shun County Committee believed that it was necessary to immediately improve the living conditions of the people in the mountainous areas, otherwise it would be impossible to carry out a large-scale production campaign. Therefore, they proposed ten measures to improve the lives of the masses in the mountainous areas: repairing roads, eliminating mountain hazards, developing culture and education, carrying out health and epidemic prevention work, repairing houses, reforming stoves, gradually merging isolated villages and households, solving difficulties in drinking water, solving fuel difficulties, and caring for and providing relief to elderly, weak, orphaned, and widowed households.

    In less than half a year, Ping Shun County has built and repaired more than 300 cart roads, donkey paths, and pedestrian paths, repaired nearly 3,000 houses, merged more than 120 isolated villages and households, reformed more than 2,000 stoves, increased the number of private primary schools by 15, newly established 15 amateur opera troupes, organized 87 doctors to make itinerant visits to treat the masses, established coal stations in 33 townships, organized mountain hazard fighting teams in 17 townships, and more than 3,000 elderly, weak, orphaned, and widowed households have received social relief and care from agricultural cooperatives. The living conditions of the masses in the mountainous areas have been initially improved.

    In early June, the Ping Shun County Committee of the Communist Party of China organized another visit to check the implementation of the ten measures. During the visit to more than 600 cooperative member families, it was found that many township and agricultural cooperative cadres only cared about production and not about life, emphasized the collective and disregarded the individual, and were generally indifferent to the personal difficulties of the masses. Therefore, the County Committee convened an enlarged county-wide cadre meeting, severely criticizing this ideology and work style. It pointed out that the ideology and work style of only focusing on production and not caring about the hardships of the masses had seriously affected the relationship between the Party and the masses, and the relationship between the cooperatives and the cooperative members. It demanded that all cadres establish a style of caring for the lives of the masses and learn the skills of comprehensively organizing the production and life of the masses. The County Committee led this group of cadres to restudy Comrade Mao Zedong's article "Concern for the Well-being of the Masses, Pay Attention to Working Methods." Many township and cooperative cadres made sincere self-criticisms, expressing their determination to improve their work. The County Committee also required everyone to make universal visits to cooperative member families after returning. After returning, Yan Changgen, the head of Xingcheng Township, immediately organized township and cooperative cadres to universally visit the farmers of the entire township within three days. Many problems that could be solved were quickly and properly resolved.

    The county-wide farm household visiting work is proceeding according to plan, and all of the county's more than 29,000 farmers will be visited this time, and their daily living conditions will be further improved. According to statistics from 33 townships in late June, more than 7,700 farm households have already been visited.

    全面组织群众生产和改善群众生活
    平顺县干部普遍访问农户
    本报太原21日电　山西平顺县四十九个乡和184个农业生产合作社的干部，正在全县二万九千多个农户中普遍进行访问，帮助农业生产合作社社员解决日常生活上急需解决的困难。
    中共平顺县委今年一月间曾经组织访问团到贫瘠山区——虹梯关、玉峡关等十八个乡逐户调查访问。访问团看到这些地区的群众虽然已经有吃有穿，但因山区自然条件的限制，在生活上和生产上还有许多困难。例如群众打不到柴，买不到煤；盘绕在悬崖峭壁上的羊肠小道，窄滑难走，每年发生人畜跌伤跌死的不幸事件；人同牲口家禽住在一起，屋子里炉灶没有烟囱，淘菜、洗衣和饮水都在一个露天水池里；医疗机构不健全，看病请不到医生；90％以上的人不识字，许多人活到七、八十岁没有看过戏；狼吃人、吃牲畜的事情不断发生；居住很分散，孤庄独户，给生产上、生活上造成很大的困难。
    平顺县委作了这次访问以后，认为必须立即着手改善山区人民的生活条件，否则无法开展大生产运动，于是，提出了在山区整修道路，消灭山害，开展文化教育，开展卫生防疫工作，修缮住宅，改革炉灶，逐步合并孤庄独户，解决吃水困难，燃料困难，照顾和救济老弱孤寡户十项改善群众生活的措施。
    不到半年，平顺县已修通和修整大车道、驴走道、人行道三百多条，修缮房屋近三千间，合并孤庄独户一百二十多户，改革炉灶两千多个，增加民办小学十五所，新建业余剧团十五个，组织了八十七名医生巡回下乡给群众治病，在三十三个乡里面设立了煤站，十七个乡组织了打山害大队，有三千多老弱孤寡户得到了社会救济和农业社的照顾，山区群众生活条件得到了初步的改善。
    六月初，中共平顺县委为检查十项措施贯彻执行情况，又组织了一次访问。在对六百多户社员家庭访问中，发现许多乡和农业社干部只管生产，不管生活，强调集体，不顾个人，对群众个人困难，熟视无睹的现象普遍存在，县委因此召开了全县扩大干部会议，对这种思想作风作了严厉的批判，指出只重生产，不关心群众疾苦的思想作风已经严重影响了党和群众的关系，影响了合作社和社员的关系，要求所有干部树立起关心群众生活的风气，学好全面组织群众生产和生活的本领。县委领导这批干部重新学习了毛泽东同志“关心群众生活，注意工作方法”一文，许多乡、社干部都作了真诚的检查，表示一定要改进工作。县委并要求大家回去以后对社员家庭作普遍访问。杏城乡乡长阎长根回去以后，立刻组织乡、社干部三天之内普遍访问了全乡的农民，许多可以解决的问题，都迅速得到妥善解决。
    全县农户访问工作正在按计划进行，全县两万九千多户农民都将在这次被访问，他们日常生活条件将进一步得到改进。据六月下旬三十三个乡的材料统计，有七千七百多个农户已被访问过。
