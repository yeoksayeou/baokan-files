Xinhua News Agency, July 7th – The Ministry of Internal Affairs recently issued a notice regarding the prevention and rescue of new disasters.

The notice points out that the rainy season came early this year, and some areas of Anhui, Henan, and Jiangsu provinces have already experienced flood disasters. Currently, the Yangtze River, Huai River, Yellow River, and other rivers are in a period of intense flood prevention.

In order to prevent new disasters and reduce losses after new disasters occur, the Ministry of Internal Affairs requires the following in this notice: Regardless of whether a region has already experienced a disaster or not, disaster relief work must be deployed. Past experience has proven that with heavy water and heavy rain, good prevention and rescue do not necessarily lead to disaster; conversely, ideological paralysis and carelessness often lead to problems. Currently, some areas attach great importance to the prevention and rescue of new disasters, but other areas one-sidedly emphasize the busy agricultural production, blindly believe that water conservancy projects are good, are satisfied with having experience in flood control work, and even believe that the major flood has not yet arrived, thus neglecting disaster prevention work. These are all very harmful and must be overcome and corrected.

The notice states: Once a new disaster occurs, all efforts should be devoted to rescue and emergency relief should be provided. At the same time, the masses should be mobilized to carry out production for self-salvation. Prevention and rescue of new disasters is the center of work in disaster areas. The organization of the disaster relief committee must be strengthened, and cadres must be constantly sent down to inspect. In areas where no disasters have occurred, preparations for the prevention and rescue of new disasters should be checked. In areas where disasters have already occurred, inspections should be carried out in conjunction with rescue and condolence work.

    内务部发出通知
    提早防汛，抢救新灾
    新华社7日讯　内务部最近发出关于预防和抢救新灾的通知。
    通知指出，今年雨季来得早，安徽、河南、江苏等省部分地区已发生了涝灾。目前，长江、淮河、黄河等河流正在紧张防汛期间。
    为了预防新灾和减少新灾发生后的损失，内务部在这个通知中要求：不论已发生或未发生灾害的地区，都必须布署救灾工作。历年经验证明，水大、雨大，防救得好，并不一定成灾：相反，思想麻痹大意，往往要出岔子。当前有些地区对新灾的预防和抢救工作是很重视的，但也有些地区片面强调农业生产忙，盲目认为水利工程好，满足于防洪工作有经验，甚至认为大汛未到，从而忽视防灾工作，这些都是很有害的，必须克服纠正。
    这个通知中说：新灾一旦发生，应该全力投入抢救，并予以紧急救济，同时，要发动群众开展生产自救。预防和抢救新灾是灾区工作的中心，救灾委员会的组织必须加强起来，要不断的派出干部下去检查，没有发生灾害的地区，要检查对预防和抢救新灾的准备，已经发生灾害的地区，要结合抢救、慰问工作进行检查。
