Xinhua News Agency, Baoding, 27th. Currently, over 20,000 agricultural production cooperatives in Hebei Province are improving production organization and revising labor quotas, leading members to strengthen field management of crops, striving to exceed this year's production increase plan.

In response to the situation of damp fields, abundant weeds, and tight agricultural work this year, over two hundred agricultural cooperatives in Shenxian County have implemented specialized management of crops by assigning blocks to teams and rows to individuals. In Nanhe, Xingtai and other counties, over half of the cooperatives have contracted some of the field management tasks for various crops to individual households. In many counties of Handan, Xingtai, Shijiazhuang and other regions, over 60% of the cooperatives have revised labor quotas in the field production based on the damp soil and abundant weeds.

After adjusting labor organization and revising labor quotas, the sense of responsibility of the members has been strengthened, their enthusiasm for labor has been enhanced, and the field management of crops has been greatly strengthened. Now, agricultural cooperatives in various parts of the province have weeded over 13 million mu of weedy land. Timely cultivation has also been carried out on fields with fewer weeds, and activities to capture and kill pests such as locusts and cotton aphids have been launched in a timely manner. In the weeding and weed control campaign, 400,000 people from agricultural cooperatives in the Tianjin area launched a competition. After Xinchao Cooperative in Wu'an County timely revised one type of weeding quota into four types of quotas, the number of laborers participating in weeding and weed control increased from more than 800 to more than 2,200 per day. Members went to the fields in the rain, avoiding heavy rain, weeding in light rain, weeding in the front, picking up grass in the back. The cooperative's 16,000 mu of crops were weeded once in just six days.

Hebei Province had an early rainy season and high rainfall this year. The field period was also rainy and the ground was wet, with weeds growing everywhere. Many crops such as cotton and corn had weak stems and leaves and needed to be strengthened immediately. Weeding, cultivation, pest control, and topdressing were very tight and arduous. Therefore, agricultural cooperatives in various places have taken measures such as adjusting production organization and revising labor quotas on the basis of contracting work, in accordance with the requirements of members and the instructions of higher authorities, in order to strive for over fulfilling the production increase.

### 加强伏期作物管理消灭草荒现象  河北省两万多个农业合作社改进生产组织修订劳动定额

    加强伏期作物管理消灭草荒现象
    河北省两万多个农业合作社改进生产组织修订劳动定额
    新华社保定27日电　当前，河北省两万多个农业生产合作社正在改进生产组织、修订劳动定额，领导社员加强农作物的伏期管理，争取超额实现今年的增产计划。
    针对今年伏天地湿草多农活紧张的情况，深县已有二百多个农业社的庄稼，实行了组包块、人包垅的专责管理。南和、邢台等县半数以上的社，将各种作物的一些伏期管理农活分别包给各户。邯郸、邢台、石家庄等专区许多县60％以上的社，在伏期生产当中，都根据地湿草多的情况，修订了劳动定额。
    调整劳力组织和修订劳动定额以后，加强了社员的责任心，提高了劳动积极性，大大加强了农作物伏期管理。现在，这个省各地农业社已把一千三百多万亩苗荒地锄灭。对杂草较少的田地，也适时进行了中耕，并且及时地展开了捕灭飞蝗、棉蚜虫等害虫的活动。在锄草灭荒中，天津专区的农业社有四十万人展开了竞赛。武安县信超社及时修改一种锄地定额为四种定额后，每天参加锄地灭荒的劳力由八百多人增到两千二百多人。社员们冒雨下地，大雨避、小雨锄、前面锄地，后面拾草，全社一万六千亩庄稼，六天就普锄过一遍。
    河北省今年雨期早、雨量大，伏期又雨多地湿，杂草丛生，不少棉花、玉米等庄稼秸棵嫩弱，需及时加强管理，而锄草、中耕、除虫、追肥等农活又非常紧张艰巨。因此，各地农业社才根据社员要求与上级指示，在包工的基础上采取了调整生产组织修改劳动定额等力争超额增产的措施。
