    Why Not Do a Good Job of Preparation?
    I am a cadre transferred from Tianjin to Tibet. A group of over twenty of us set off from Tianjin on May 25th and passed through Xi'an on the 27th. We thought we could rest in Xi'an for a day or two before leaving. Who knew that once we settled down, it would be a month? During this month, like the other hundred-plus cadres transferred to Tibet from other regions who were also staying in Xi'an, we spent our time playing cards, reading novels, and sleeping. We are all used to working, and we felt really uneasy wasting time like this. After much anticipation, we finally left Xi'an on June 25th. Who knew that upon arriving in Lanzhou, we were made to stay again because a driver couldn't be found? We have already been staying in Lanzhou for a week now, and we really don't know how much longer we will be delayed on this journey. We want to question: Why didn't the department transferring the cadres do a good job of preparation beforehand? (A Cadre)

    为什么不作好准备工作
    我是从天津调往西藏的干部，我们一行二十余人，五月二十五日从天津动身，二十七日途经西安，我们以为在西安休息一两天就可以走了。谁知一住下来，就是一个月。在这一个月中，和我们同停留在西安的，由其他地区调往西藏的一百多名干部一样，每天利用打扑克、看小说、睡大觉来消磨时间。我们都是工作惯了的人，这样浪费时间，我们感到实在于心不安。好容易盼到六月二十五日离开了西安，谁知到了兰州因为找不到开车的司机，又让我们住下了。现在我们已经在兰州住了一个星期，我们真不知道还要在这一路上耽误多久。我们要质问：调动干部的部门，事先为什么不做好准备工作呢？　（一干部）
