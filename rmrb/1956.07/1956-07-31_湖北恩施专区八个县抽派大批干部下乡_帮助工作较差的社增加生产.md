Xinhua News Agency, Enshi, 28th - In Enshi Prefecture, Hubei Province, some agricultural cooperatives that had been performing poorly have recently made significant progress.

    Enshi County originally had eleven such cooperatives, which were initially estimated to experience a reduction of 290,000 jin of grain this year. Later, the county leading organs assisted these cooperatives in formulating diversified management plans, intensified weeding and topdressing of farmland to strive for large-scale production increases, and engaged in many sideline occupations. It is now expected that these eleven cooperatives can increase production by more than 20% this year. The Fourth Cooperative of Jiujiandian Township in Xuanen County was originally expected to decrease production by 25%, but is now expected to increase production by 30% after planning.

    Now, the production enthusiasm of the members of these cooperatives has greatly improved, and the cooperative cadres' confidence in increasing production has also increased. They have all participated in the labor emulation campaign currently being carried out in various counties to strive for increased production in every cooperative and increased income for more than 90% of the members.

    The transformation of these cooperatives is the result of strengthened leadership by the counties. In mid-July, all eight counties in the region specifically studied the issue of leading "backward" cooperatives and dispatched a large number of cadres to work in "backward" cooperatives. The Lichuan County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party sent a total of sixty cadres to disaster-stricken and backward cooperatives and instructed the financial and economic departments to practically help "backward" cooperatives solve difficulties in terms of economy and sideline occupations. When the Badong County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party sent cadres to "backward" cooperatives, it also conscientiously summarized and exchanged the experiences of rectifying "backward" cooperatives in the previous stage, arming the working cadres.

    According to our newspaper, the Party branch of Dongta Township in Pingjiang County, Hunan Province, has taken measures to strengthen leadership over five agricultural cooperatives that are at risk of reducing production.

    There are forty-four elementary cooperatives and one advanced cooperative in this township. According to a recent inspection by the Party branch, it was found that five elementary cooperatives were at risk of reducing production. These five cooperatives did not complete the planned early rice planting area; the economic crops planted on the mountains were also not being managed. Sideline production also had few avenues and low income. In June, the five cooperatives planned to earn 1,700 yuan in cash, but actually only earned 320 yuan, with the most earning only 80 yuan. In terms of labor management, some cooperatives still assigned work every day and evaluated every night, resulting in very serious idleness. The financial system was unsound, many accounts had no receipts, and income and expenditure accounts had not been announced, which made the members very dissatisfied.

    The reason for this phenomenon is that the township Party branch focused its main energy on leading advanced cooperatives and better elementary cooperatives in the previous stage, and relaxed its leadership over cooperatives with a weaker foundation. Therefore, political and ideological work in these five cooperatives was weak, labor discipline was lax, and the enthusiasm of many members for labor was not high.

    In order to strengthen leadership over these cooperatives, the Party branch transferred five main cadres from the township to help work in these cooperatives, so that these cooperatives could start by doing a good job in current agricultural production, improve the internal management system of the cooperatives, and mobilize all members to find ways to increase the income of the cooperatives from all aspects.

    Now, with the help of the branch, the situation of these five cooperatives has begun to improve. Under the personal help of the township head, the Lotus Cooperative successfully completed the transplanting of inter-cropped late rice on 300 mu of land and universally applied topdressing fertilizer in fields where seedlings were not growing well.

### 湖北恩施专区八个县抽派大批干部下乡  帮助工作较差的社增加生产

    湖北恩施专区八个县抽派大批干部下乡
    帮助工作较差的社增加生产
    新华社恩施28日电　湖北省恩施专区各县的一些工作较差的农业社，最近都有很大的进步。
    恩施县原有十一个这样的社，原来估计这些社今年要减产二十九万斤粮食。后来县领导机关帮助这些社订了多种经营的规划，对农田抓紧了锄草追肥，争取大面积增产，又经营了许多副业。现在预计这十一个社今年都可以增产两成以上。宣恩县九间店乡第四社原来要减产二成半，规划后预计可增产三成。
    现在，这些社的社员生产情绪大大好转，社干部的增产信心也高了，都参加了各县正在开展的争取社社增产和90％以上的社员都能增加收入的劳动竞赛运动。
    这些社的转变，是各县加强领导的结果。七月中旬，全区八个县都专门研究了领导“落后”社的问题，并且抽派大批干部到“落后”社去工作。中共利川县委派到受灾社和落后社去的干部共有六十人，并且指示各财经部门，在经济上和副业门路上，要切实帮助“落后”社解决困难。中共巴东县委在派干部到“落后”社去的时候，还认真地总结，交流了前一阶段整顿“落后”社的经验，武装了工作干部。
    本报讯　湖南省平江县冬塔乡的党支部，采取措施，加强对五个有减产危险的农业社的领导。
    这个乡有四十四个初级社，一个高级社。根据党支部最近的检查，发现有五个初级社存在着减产的危险。这五个社的早稻种植面积没有完成预订计划；种在山上的经济作物也没有人管理。副业生产也是门路不多，收入不大，六月份五个社计划收入现金一千七百元，但实际只收入三百二十元，最多的社只收入八十元。在劳动管理上，有的社还是天天排工，晚晚评分，窝工现象非常严重。财务制度不健全，许多账目没有单据，收支账目没有公布过，社员很不满意。
    造成这种现象的原因是乡的党支部在前一段把主要精力放在领导高级社和较好的初级社，放松了对基础较差的社的领导。因此，这五个社的政治思想工作薄弱，劳动纪律松弛，不少社员劳动积极性不高。
    为了加强对这些社的领导，党支部抽调乡的五个主要干部，分别到这些社帮助工作，使这些社从搞好目前农业生产着手，改进社内管理制度，发动全体社员想办法，从各方面增加社的收入。
    现在，在支部帮助下，这五个社的情况已开始好转。荷花社在乡长亲自帮助下，顺利完成了三百亩田的间作晚稻的插秧工作，在禾苗生长不好的田里普遍追肥。　（黄者清）
