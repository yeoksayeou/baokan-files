Xinhua News Agency Report: The feeders of the First Agricultural Production Cooperative in Shenchuan Township, Nantong County, Jiangsu Province, recently held a duck raising experience exchange meeting.

The cooperative bought two thousand ducklings a month and a half ago and distributed them to eight brigades for raising. Some brigades had high survival rates for the ducklings, and they were fat and large; other brigades had low survival rates for the ducklings, and they were thin and small. In this situation, the cooperative's sideline production committee held this duck raising experience exchange meeting. Zheng Jinchun, the feeder of the Third Brigade, told everyone: Feeders must concentrate on raising ducks, and often measure the temperature of the duck nest to ensure that it is suitable for both cold and heat; the feeding of water and feed should be uniform; and the ducklings should be put into the river and fields early to eat live food. He said that they used these methods to achieve a 94% survival rate for the ducklings, and now the average weight of each duckling is three and a half jin. The ducks of the First and Fourth Brigades were unevenly exposed to cold and heat, sometimes hungry and sometimes full, and they were late in eating live food. The survival rate of more than 500 ducklings was only 86%, and the current average weight of each duckling is only one and a half jin. Chen Jingui and Gu Jinlong, the feeders of these two brigades, reviewed the shortcomings of their work and stated that they would raise the ducks well in the future.

Neighboring agricultural cooperatives are learning successful duck raising experiences from this cooperative.

    养鸭经验交流会
    据新华社讯　江苏省南通县沈川乡第一农业生产合作社的饲养员，最近举行了一次养鸭经验交流会。
    这个社在一个半月前买回两千只小鸭，分给八个大队饲养，有的队小鸭成活率高，又肥又大；有的队小鸭成活率低，又瘦又小。在这种情况下，社的副业生产委员会就举行了这个养鸭经验交流会。第三大队饲养员郑金春向大家介绍说：饲养员必须集中精力养鸭，经常测量鸭窝温度，做到冷热适宜；喂水和饲料要均匀；要把小鸭提早放到河里田间吃活食。他说他们就是用这些办法，使小鸭成活率达94％，现在平均每只重三斤半。第一、四两个大队的鸭子冷热不均，饥一顿饱一顿，活食吃得迟，五百多只小鸭成活率只有86％，目前平均每只只有一斤半重。这两个大队的饲养员陈金贵和顾金龙检讨了自己工作的缺点，表示今后要把鸭子养好。
    邻近的农业社正在向这个社学习成功的养鸭经验。
