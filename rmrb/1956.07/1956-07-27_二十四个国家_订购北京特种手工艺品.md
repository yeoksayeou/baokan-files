Xinhua News Agency, 26th dispatch: The export volume of Beijing's specialty handicrafts in the first half of this year is a quarter more than the total export volume of 1950 (excluding carpets and pewter ware). Currently, twenty-four countries in Asia, Africa, Europe, and the Americas are directly ordering specialty handicrafts from Beijing's export departments.

Before 1950, 90% of Beijing's exported specialty handicrafts were sold to the United States, with only a small amount being re-sold to other countries via Hong Kong. From 1953 onwards, Beijing's specialty handicrafts began to be sold in the Soviet Union and various People's Democratic countries. Now, exports to the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries account for two-thirds of its total exports. In recent years, Beijing's specialty handicrafts have participated in expositions or exhibitions in more than twenty countries, including the Soviet Union, the German Democratic Republic, Syria, Egypt, and France. People from various countries have not only heard of their reputation but have also witnessed the genuine artistry and craftsmanship of these products, as well as their reasonable prices, and are eagerly placing orders. Beijing's jade, cloisonné, filigree jewelry, or drawnwork tablecloths now appear in the markets of Finland and Sweden in Northern Europe, and Egypt, Syria, and Lebanon in the Middle East.

    二十四个国家
    订购北京特种手工艺品
    据新华社26日讯　北京市特种手工艺品今年上半年的出口量，比1950年全年还多四分之一（地毯、铜锡器除外）。目前直接向北京市出口部门订购特种手工艺品的，包括有亚洲、非洲、欧洲和美洲的二十四个国家。
    1950年以前，北京出口的特种手工艺品有90％销售美国，只有少数由香港转销其他各国。从1953年起，北京特种手工艺品开始行销于苏联和各人民民主国家。现在，对苏联和各人民民主国家的出口量，占到了它的总出口量的三分之二。几年以来，北京特种手工艺品参加了苏联、德意志民主共和国和叙利亚、埃及、法国等二十几个国家的博览会或展览会。各国人民不仅耳闻其名，而且目睹了这些工艺品真的工精艺美、货真价实，于是争相订购。在北欧的芬兰、瑞典和中近东的埃及、叙利亚、黎巴嫩的市场上，现在都出现了北京的玉器、景泰蓝、花丝首饰或挑补花台布。
