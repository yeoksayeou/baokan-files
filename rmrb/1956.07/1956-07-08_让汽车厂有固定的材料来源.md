Let Automobile Factories Have Fixed Sources of Materials
Ma Chengzhai, Deputy Director of the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant

    The First Automobile Manufacturing Plant will soon commence production.

    A major characteristic of production at the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant is the fixed product, rhythmic, balanced, and large-scale assembly line production, which is different from enterprises that produce single items or small batches. Therefore, a new material allocation method that is compatible with this is needed.

    The automotive industry requires materials of many varieties and high quality. More than 70% of the materials currently cannot be produced in our country. Our metallurgical industry must add equipment, tap potential, and actively trial-produce new products and improve technical levels to gradually achieve independent supply of automotive materials. To increase new varieties of steel, it is necessary to make overall arrangements and divide labor for production based on the specific conditions of steel plants. The same new product should not be trialed by many steel plants across the country. For this reason, we hope to fix our factory's material sources. We believe this is a very important matter. Of course, fixed sources still require the state to conduct annual and quarterly balance allocation and dispatch based on resource conditions and priorities. However, the two are not contradictory. Therefore, more precisely, we hope that the state will use a combination of annual and quarterly balance allocation and fixed source allocation methods to supply our automotive materials. This issue of fixed material sources will also be encountered in enterprises similar to automobile factories in the future.

    Currently, the materials our factory needs are entirely reliant on temporary allocation by the state on a quarterly basis, which has caused us many specific difficulties. In the first and second quarter orders, there are more than ten items for which the same material is allocated to two or three steel plants for production. For example, the connecting rod is a very important part of the automobile. The material it requires—40 grade carbon steel with a diameter of 45 mm—is allocated to three steel plants for production. Under normal circumstances, these three plants can produce this material. However, we have special technical requirements, and if they are not met, the quality of the parts cannot be guaranteed. It is not possible for these three steel plants to all meet these requirements. At the same time, these three steel plants are providing temporary support to us, and next time, this type of carbon steel may not be allocated to these plants. In this way, the quality of our materials cannot be guaranteed. Sometimes, a certain material is not allocated to the plant that can produce it, but is allocated to the plant that cannot produce it. Some of the steel we requested in the second quarter experienced this kind of unreasonable phenomenon.

    We must also see that although steel plants are willing to support the automobile factory, no one is willing to constantly adopt temporary technical measures, because temporary measures can cause losses to the steel plant. Everyone is not afraid of difficulties, but afraid that the new achievements obtained at a great cost may not be used in the future. Who would want to spend energy on this? Therefore, from the steel plant's perspective, fixing customers and producing fixed materials is also of great benefit to improving business management and improving technical levels.

    Unfixed sources and temporary assignment of tasks also bring us the following difficulties: a certain material is allocated to Fushun in the first quarter, may be allocated to Taiyuan in the second quarter, and may be allocated to Daye or Chongqing in the third quarter. In this way, it is difficult for us to calculate the amount of reserves. The amount of reserves is determined based on the quantity required within the transportation cycle, plus other factors. Under temporary allocation, it is impossible to determine the transportation cycle. People are afraid of not being able to supply, and will inevitably expand the amount of reserves, which will accumulate working capital.

    Based on these reasons, we request to fix the source of materials.

    There are many benefits to fixing the source of materials. First of all, after fixing the source of materials, we can establish fixed technical connections with each steel plant separately. The steel plant can take technical measures according to the special requirements of automotive materials, and even consider adding equipment and tools. Taking one measure can meet the needs of long-term production, which is also cost-effective for the steel plant. We can also regularly report the situation of steel use to these steel plants, so that the quality of steel can be continuously improved, and the size of steel can reach the most reasonable and economical requirements, ensuring that the quality of automotive materials can be stabilized. Secondly, after the source of materials is fixed, the automobile factory can submit long-term material plans to the steel plant separately, and can submit quarterly and monthly orders in advance every year. In this way, the automobile factory can not only organize the supply of materials in a balanced manner, but also the steel plant can smoothly determine the production plan. Third, after the source of materials is fixed, we can accurately calculate the amount of material reserves and accelerate the turnover of working capital.

    A problem related to fixing the source of materials is the need to approve the automobile factory's material technical conditions as the common technical legal basis for the automobile factory and the steel plant. Without a legal basis, the two sides often argue endlessly about technical conditions, which affects production. This lesson has been learned more than once. In the past, when encountering this kind of problem, the comrades of the steel plant asked us: "What is the basis for your requirements?" We often said with confidence: "Based on our product design and process requirements. If I want to buy a coat, why do you ask me the basis for choosing this style?" But upon careful consideration, the comrades of the steel plant also have their reasons. Although we have the basis of design and process, we do not have a common legal written basis for both parties. In the past, our technical data was not prepared fully enough. Now we have made full preparations and produced a complete set of technical data. We hope that the First Ministry of Machine Building and the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry will convene a material technology conference, allocate sources, and at the same time review and approve these technical conditions. Otherwise, even if a principle allocation is made, specific technical problems cannot be solved, and time will be delayed.

    Now our automobile factory is about to produce automobiles, and there are still many difficulties in producing them continuously and in large quantities in the future. The main difficulty lies in the supply of materials. It is hoped that the relevant departments will expand and organize the source of automotive materials well and quickly, and ensure the supply of automotive materials.

    让汽车厂有固定的材料来源
    第一汽车制造厂副厂长　马诚斋
    第一汽车制造厂不久就要开工生产了。
    第一汽车厂生产上的主要特点是产品固定，有节奏地均衡地大量流水生产，和单件小批生产的企业不一样。因此需要有相适应的新的材料分配方法。
    汽车工业需要的材料，品种多，质量高。70％以上的材料，目前我国还不能生产。我国冶金工业必须增添设备，挖掘潜力，积极试制新产品，提高技术水平，才能逐步达到独立供应汽车材料的要求。要增加钢材的新品种，就要根据钢厂具体条件，通盘安排，分工生产。不能把同一种新产品让全国许多钢厂都来试制。由于这个原故，我们希望固定我们厂的材料货源。我们认为，这是很重要的事情。当然，固定货源，仍然需要国家根据资源情况和轻重缓急，进行年度、季度的平衡分配和调度。但是二者并不矛盾。因此，更确切地说，我们希望国家用年度、季度平衡分配和固定货源相结合的分配方法，来供给我们汽车材料。这个固定材料货源的问题，今后在和汽车厂相类似的企业中也会遇到。
    目前，我们厂需要的材料，完全靠国家按季度来临时分配，这使我们遇到了许多具体困难。一、二季度的定货中，同一项材料被分配到两三个钢厂去生产的，就有十多项。例如，连杆是汽车上很重要的零件。它所需要的材料——40号45公厘直径的炭钢，就被分配到三个钢厂去生产。在一般情况下，这种材料，三个厂是都能生产的。但是我们有特殊的技术要求，达不到要求，就不能保证零件的质量。这三个钢厂就不可能都达到这种要求。同时，这三个钢厂对我们是临时支援，下一次这种炭钢就可能不分配给这几个钢厂。这样我们的材料质量就无法保证了。有时候，某一项材料，能生产的厂子没有分配到，不能生产的厂子却分配了。我们在第二季度提出的一些钢材，就发生了这类不合理的现象。
    我们还要看到，各钢厂虽然都愿意支援汽车厂，但是谁也不愿意总在采取临时技术措施。因为临时措施会使钢厂受到损失。大家不害怕困难，害怕的倒是花了很大代价取得的新成就，以后却未必能用得上。谁愿意把精力花费在这种事情上呢？所以从钢厂的角度来讲，把主顾固定下来，生产固定的材料，也是对改善经营管理和提高技术水平有很大好处的。
    货源不固定，临时分配任务，还给我们带来了这样的困难：某一项材料第一季度分配到抚顺，第二季度可能分配到太原，第三季度又可能分配到大冶或重庆。这样我们就很难计算储备量。储备量是根据运输周期内需要的数量，再加其他因素来确定的。在临时分配的情况下，就无法确定运输周期。人们害怕供应不上，必然要扩大储备量，这就会积压流动资金。
    根据这些理由，我们要求固定材料货源。
    固定货源有很多好处。首先，固定货源以后，我们能够和各钢厂分别建立固定的技术方面的联系，钢厂可以按照汽车材料的特殊要求采取技术措施，以至于考虑增添设备和工具。采取一次措施，能够满足长期生产的需要，这对钢厂也很合算。我们还可以经常向这些钢厂反映钢材使用中的情况，使钢材质量不断提高，使钢材尺寸达到最合理最节约的要求，保证汽车材料的质量能够稳固。其次，货源固定以后，汽车厂可以分别向钢厂提出长远的用料计划，每年可以事先提出分季分月的订货计划。这样，汽车厂既能够均衡地组织材料供应，钢厂也能够顺利地确定生产计划。第三、货源固定以后，我们可以准确地计算材料的储备量，加速流动资金的周转。
    和固定货源相联系的一个问题，是需要批准以汽车厂材料技术条件作为汽车厂和钢厂共同的技术上的合法依据。没有合法的依据，双方在技术条件上常常争论不休，以致影响生产。这种教训已有不止一次了。过去碰到这种问题的时候，钢厂的同志问我们：“你们的要求根据什么呢？”我们也常常理直气壮地说：“根据我们的产品设计和工艺要求嘛。我要买一件上衣，你何必问我选择这种样式的根据呢？”但是仔细考虑起来，钢厂的同志们问的也有道理。我们虽然有设计和工艺的根据，但是却没有双方共同的合法的文字依据。过去我们技术资料也准备得不够齐全，现在我们已经进行了充分的准备，做出了全套的技术资料。我们希望第一机械工业部和冶金工业部召集材料技术会议，分配货源，同时审查批准这些技术条件，不然的话，即使做了原则上的分配，遇到具体技术问题解决不了，又要拖延时日。
    现在我们汽车厂快要生产汽车了，将来要连续地大量地生产下去还有不少困难。主要的困难就在材料供应方面。希望有关部门又好又快地扩大和组织好汽车材料货源，保证汽车材料的供应。
