    Peach - China's Earliest Cultivated Fruit Tree
    Tao Rongzong
    The peach originated in the plateau areas of China, such as Shaanxi, Gansu, and Tibet. Initially, it was a wild, inedible peach. Through the long-term and continuous cultivation by the working people of China, hundreds of excellent varieties have gradually been created.
    There are records about peaches in books such as the "Classic of Poetry" and "Erya." The Chinese people have been planting peaches for three thousand years. In Jia Sixie’s "Qi Min Yao Shu" of the Northern and Southern Dynasties, the cultivation techniques of peaches are recorded in even greater detail.
    With the exchange of Eastern and Western cultures, Chinese peaches gradually spread to all parts of the world. They first spread to Europe, then to Korea and Japan, and around the seventeenth century, they spread to the Americas.
    Peaches are widely distributed in China. From Heilongjiang to Guangdong, from the coast to Xinjiang and Tibet, peach trees are planted everywhere. However, the most suitable area for growing peaches is between 30° and 40° north latitude. The main peach-producing areas in China are Shandong, Xinjiang, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Shaanxi, Hubei, Hebei, Gansu, and Henan provinces, and the output of these areas accounts for more than 90% of the total national output.
    There are approximately four hundred varieties of common peaches in China. Shandong's "Siyueban" and Hebei's "Wuyuexian" and "Tianjin Water Honey" are varieties that ripen earlier. Beijing's "Daye White Peach," Shanghai's "Baimang Water Honey," and Hebei's "Shenzhou Water Honey" mature between July, August, and September. Recently, a winter peach that matures in December was discovered in Shang County and the Guanzhong area of Shaanxi. This is the latest-maturing peach in China. The flowering period of this peach is similar to that of ordinary peaches, but it does not mature until December. The leaves of this peach tree often fall off, but the peaches still hang on the branches.
    Chinese peaches taste very delicious, and the fruits are very large. The average weight of a Shandong Feicheng Buddha peach is eleven taels each. In 1954, a Buddha peach weighing one catty and six taels was discovered in the practice orchard of Shandong Agricultural College in Jinan.
    Peaches are a fruit that is not resistant to storage, but "Qingzhou Water Honey" peaches can be harvested in September and stored until February or March of the following year. In addition to the common varieties, Chinese peaches also include flat-shaped, delicious pan peaches and "oil peaches" (also known as Liguan peaches) without fuzz on the skin.
    Peaches are fragrant, juicy, and sweet; peach trees bear fruit quickly, mature early, and have a high yield per unit area. The Qinfen Agricultural Production Cooperative in Houlang Township, Fenghua, Zhejiang, regards peach cultivation as its main sideline occupation. The cooperative's fifty mu of water honey peaches has an average annual output of 84,000 catties, which can generate an income of more than 10,000 yuan, with an average income of more than 100 yuan per household.

    桃——我国栽培最早的果树
    陶荣宗
    桃，原产在我国的陕西、甘肃、西藏等高原地带，最初是一种不能吃的毛桃，经过我国劳动人民长期不断地培育，逐渐创造出几百个优良的品种。
    “诗经”、“尔雅”等书中都有关于桃的记述。在三千年前，我国人民就种桃了。南北朝魏贾思勰所著“齐民要术”中，对于桃的栽培技术，记载的更加详尽。
    随着东西文化的交流，我国的桃逐渐传到世界各地。最初传到欧洲，随后传到朝鲜和日本，约在十七世纪又传到美洲。
    桃在我国分布极广。从黑龙江到广东，从沿海到新疆、西藏，到处都种桃树。但是，种桃的最适宜的地区是北纬30°—40°之间。我国主要产桃的地区是山东、新疆、江苏、浙江、陕西、湖北、河北、甘肃、河南九省，这些地区的产量，占全国总产量的90％以上。
    我国的最常见的普通桃，大约有四百多个品种。山东的“四月半”、河北的“五月鲜”“天津水蜜”都是成热较早的品种。北京的“大叶白桃”，上海的“白芒水蜜”、河北的“深州水蜜”的成熟期在七、八、九月间。最近在陕西商县和关中一带发现一种在十二月成熟的冬桃，这是我国最晚熟的一种桃。这种桃的开花期和一般桃相仿，可是直到十二月才成熟。这种桃树常常叶子落了，桃子还挂在枝头。
    我国的桃，味道很美，果实很大。山东肥城佛桃平均每个重十一两。1954年在济南山东农学院的实习果园里，曾发现一个一斤六两的佛桃。
    桃是一种不耐储藏的果品，但是“青州水蜜”桃在九月采收后，可以储存到第二年二、三月。我国的桃除了常见的品种以外，还有果形扁、味道美的蟠桃和皮上没有茸毛的“油桃”（又名李光桃）。
    桃芳香、汁多、味甜；桃树结果快，成熟早，单位面积产量高。浙江奉化后琅乡的勤奋农业生产合作社，把栽培桃子作为主要副业。全社五十亩水蜜桃，常年产量平均八万四千斤，可以收入一万余元，平均每户有一百多元的收入。（附图片）
    这是陕西商县的冬桃，桃树的叶子耐不住寒霜而雕谢了，可是桃子却在生长成熟中。
