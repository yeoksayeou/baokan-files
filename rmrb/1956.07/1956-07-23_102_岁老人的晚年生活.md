Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, 21st - One hundred and two-year-old widower, Feng Xingfa, is now living his later years without worry. Feng Xingfa joined the Xinmin Township Agricultural Cooperative last winter. This cooperative is in Nanchong County, Sichuan Province. Now, the agricultural cooperative sends him rice, pork, and lard every month, and members help him cook. The members also repaired his dilapidated house for him and gave him a bed. Before this, he had received rice, oil, meat, new cotton wadding, and new cotton clothes from the Nanchong County People's Committee.

Feng Xingfa was born into a poor peasant family. He began herding cattle for landlords at the age of eight and supported his parents with his own labor from the age of eighteen. After his parents died, he worked as a sedan carrier and day laborer everywhere. At the age of seventy, he thought that he was old and helpless, and that no one would take care of him after he died, so he used the little money he had saved over the years to buy a coffin for himself. Because there was no bed in his house, he had been sleeping in the coffin every night since then.

Although this old man is white-haired, he is still very strong. He grows a small vegetable plot himself. He usually strives to do some light work for the cooperative, such as drying grain and looking after chickens and ducks. When young people advise him to rest, he always says, "I have lived through several dynasties and have never seen such a good world; seeing everyone working so enthusiastically, I, an old man, am not used to being idle."

    102岁老人的晚年生活
    新华社成都21日电　一百零二岁的孤寡老人冯兴发，现在已经无愁无虑地度着他的晚年。冯兴发是去年冬天参加新民乡农业社的，这个社在四川省南充县。现在，农业社按月给他送大米、猪肉和猪油，并有社员帮着他煮饭。社员们还为他整修了破屋，送给他一张床。在这以前，他曾得到南充县人民委员会救济的米、油、肉和新棉絮、新棉衣等。
    冯兴发出生在贫农家庭，八岁起就给地主放牛，十八岁就靠他的双手劳动来养活父母。父母死后，他就到处抬滑竿、卖短工。七十岁那年，他想到自己老了无依无靠，将来死了无人管，就拿多年积存的一点钱，为自己买了一口棺材。因为家中没有床，从此夜间他就一直睡在棺材里。
    这个老人虽然白发苍苍，但却还很健壮。他自己种了一块小菜地。他平时总是争着为社内干些晒粮食、看鸡鸭等轻松活路。年轻人劝他休息，他总说：“活了几个朝代，从来没有见过这样好的世道；看见大家干得这么起劲，我老头也闲不惯。”
