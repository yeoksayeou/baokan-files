    Better to Speak Directly (Reading Thoughts)
    Mo Ganhe
    The eleventh issue of "China Youth" this year published a fable entitled "White Goose and Flowered Goose." It is not very long, and it is copied below:
    The day after the wedding, the white goose forbade the flowered goose from going to the clear water pond to wash her feathers.
    The flowered goose was surprised and asked him, "Dear, why are you doing this?"
    The white goose, with a long face (Heavens! He was completely unlike the gentle and courteous person he was when pursuing the flowered goose), replied, "You must understand that the time for you to dress up is over. From yesterday, you are mine, and you can no longer dress up to provoke others. Therefore, you should learn from your aunt, the crow. See how plain she is."
    Whether the crow is the flowered goose's "aunt" is now difficult to verify. However, it is interesting to use this fable as a parent to evolve new fables. Try changing the white goose and flowered goose into white duck and flowered duck, white chicken and flowered chicken, or white cat and flowered cat, white dog and flowered dog. As long as the original dialogue is not changed, it is still a fable, and may not be inferior to the original. From this, it can be seen that the "moral" is not "寓" (implied) in the images and characteristics of the white goose and the flowered goose, but rather two unrelated things are pieced together forcefully. After going around in a big circle, it is better to say "Husband supremacy is wrong" more directly.
    Recently, fables have increased, which is certainly gratifying. But if we do not seriously create according to the characteristics of fables, thinking that we can just pull something together, say a few human words, and call it a fable, then the future of fables is not very optimistic.

    不如直说（阅读随感）

    今年第十一期“中国青年”上登了一篇题为“白鹅和花鹅”的寓言，篇幅不大，抄录在下面：
    结婚后的第二天，白鹅就不许花鹅再到清水池里去梳洗羽毛。
    花鹅很惊异，问他：“亲爱的，你这是为什么？”
    白鹅拉长着脸（天哪！他已完全不像在追求花鹅时那样温柔多礼了），回答说：“你要明白，你打扮的时代已经过去了。从昨天起你就是我的了，你就再不能打扮起来招惹别个了。因此你应该向你的姑妈乌鸦学习，你看她多朴素。”
    乌鸦是否是花鹅的“姑妈”，现在难以考证。然而有趣的是可以用这寓言为母体，再演化出新的寓言来。试把白鹅和花鹅改成白鸭和花鸭、白鸡和花鸡，或者改成白猫和花猫、白狗和花狗，只要原来的对话不改，也仍然是一篇寓言，未必比原作逊色。由此可见，那“言”也并没有“寓”于白鹅和花鹅的形象和它们的特性之中，而是把两不相干的东西硬拼在一起。绕了个大圈子，还不如直接说“夫权主义是错误的”来得干脆些。
    近来，寓言多起来了，当然可喜。但是如果不认真地按照寓言的特点去创作，以为随便拉些什么来，说几句人话，就算是寓言，那么，寓言的前途就不太令人乐观了。
