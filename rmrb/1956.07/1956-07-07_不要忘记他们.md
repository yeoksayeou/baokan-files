In Zhaopingyang Village, Rui'an County, Zhejiang Province, there is currently a very unpleasant situation: some elderly people who made contributions to the revolution in the past are being forgotten by some of our comrades. For example, the 70-year-old farmer Huang Xianlang joined the Farmers' Association in 1926 and participated in the peasant riots in 1930. He was later arrested by the reactionaries and imprisoned for six years, suffering all kinds of torture. After his release, he continued to actively protect revolutionary comrades and persisted in participating in revolutionary activities. After liberation, he was allocated land but not a house, and he still lives in a dilapidated ancestral hall. At the end of last year, he joined the agricultural production cooperative. Although the cooperative gives him and his wife 50 yuan each year as "Five Guarantees," because he is blind and old and frail and cannot work, his life is quite difficult, and he is often excluded from relief funds. There are other elderly people in similar situations who are not receiving the care and respect they deserve.

There is an old Chinese saying: "When eating the fruit, don't forget the person who planted the tree." When we are all sharing the fruits of revolutionary victory today, we should not forget them—those who shared life and death and hardships with the revolution for this victory.

    不要忘记他们
    浙江省瑞安县肇平垟村目前存在着一种令人很不愉快的情况，这就是一些过去对革命有贡献的老人，被我们的一些同志淡忘了。比如七十岁的老农黄显狼，1926年就加入了农民协会，1930年参加过农民暴动，后被反动派逮捕坐牢六年，受尽苦刑。出狱后，仍旧积极掩护革命同志，坚持参加革命活动。解放后，他分得了土地，却没有分到房子，到现在仍然住在破祠堂里。去年年底，他参加了农业生产合作社，社里虽然每年给他老两口五十元，作为“五保”。但因两眼已瞎，加上年老力衰，不能干活，所以生活相当困难，而救济款又常常没有他的份。还有其他一些情况相似的老人，也得不到应得的照顾和敬重。
    中国有句古话：“吃果不忘栽树人”，当我们今天都在分享革命胜利果实的时候，不应该忘记他们——那些为了这一胜利跟革命同过生死共过患难的人。
