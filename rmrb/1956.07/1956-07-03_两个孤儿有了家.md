    Two Orphans Have a Home
    In Wugang Township, Yuanjiang County, Hunan Province, there are two orphans with no one to rely on. One is named Xie Wenbin, who is only twelve years old this year. His parents died one after another when he was less than ten years old. The other is Liu Meizhen, who is two years younger than Xie Wenbin, and also lost both parents. These two lonely children received sympathy from the people, but who could constantly raise them?
    The happy days for them finally arrived. When the more than 1,000 woodcutters in Wugang Township established a cooperative, they absorbed them into the production cooperative and sent them to Lushui Central Elementary School to study, with the cooperative providing seven yuan per month for food expenses for each of them. Recently, the cooperative made new clothes for them, and the cooperative director, Li Youkun, encouraged his wife to make new shoes for them. From then on, these two helpless orphans also had a warm home.
    Now, they are learning without any worries. The days of tears and snot are gone forever. (Yuanjiang Daily)

    两个孤儿有了家
    湖南沅江县武岗乡，有两个无依无靠的孤儿。一个叫谢文斌，今年才十二岁。当他还不到十岁的时候，父母就相继死亡。另一个叫刘美珍，比谢文斌小两岁，也是父母双亡。这两个孤苦伶仃的孩子，虽然得到了人们的同情，但有谁能经常抚养他们呢？
    使他们得到幸福的日子，终于到来了。武岗乡的一千多户樵民在办社时，吸收他们加入了生产合作社，并送他们到漉湖中心小学念书，每人每月由社供给七元伙食费。最近，社里给他们做了新衣服，社长李佑坤动员他的爱人给他们做了新鞋。从此，这两个无依无靠的孤儿也有了温暖的家。
    现在，他们正在无忧无虑地学习着。那种一把鼻涕一把眼泪的日子，永远不复返了。（沅江报）
