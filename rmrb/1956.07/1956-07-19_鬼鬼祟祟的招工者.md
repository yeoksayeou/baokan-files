    Sneaky Recruiters

    Five cadres from the Second Company of the Taiyuan Pipe Installation General Company of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry in Shanxi Province, without going through any procedures or contacting the local government, stayed at the Tianju East Hotel in Shenyang City to recruit workers starting in March. By early June, they had recruited about 300 plumbers alone.

    According to our investigation in Huanggu District, a total of more than 60 workers were recruited from the entire district, many of whom left without saying goodbye. In addition, the Construction and Mining Machinery Factory reported that one of their long-term workers was also lured away. Xu Zhongtang (rivet welder), a long-term worker at the Hexing Iron Factory, was also recruited by this company. Among the recruited workers, many were those we had decided to transfer to Xinjiang and Qinghai.

    In addition, the First Company of the Wuhan Pipe Installation General Company of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry also sent five or six people, including the head of the planning section, to Shenyang in early June to recruit some workers. Although they have not left yet, the impact is also very bad.

    These recruiting cadres, in order to achieve their recruiting goals, did not hesitate to sow discord between the workers and the government, saying how good their place was and that if the local government did not allow them to go, they could reason with them. As a result, the workers' emotions fluctuated greatly, and some even cursed the local government. We have raised our concerns to the recruiting comrades several times about this matter (comrades from the Central Ministry of Labor working in Shenyang also went twice). They verbally admitted their mistakes, but in reality, they secretly sent workers away in batches. Fearing that the local government would stop them, they took the workers' luggage to the North Railway Station for consignment and had the workers board the train from small stations, appearing and disappearing mysteriously, simply not like employees of a state-owned enterprise.

    Shenyang City is a city with a large number of hardware and machinery workers. We have never stated that we would not support newly built areas. In fact, in the past, many workers were transferred to other places through government planning, and some workers were even transferred from existing factories and mines. However, we firmly oppose this kind of disorganized and indiscriminate practice. We request the higher-level government to take appropriate action against the above two units, especially the Taiyuan Pipe Installation Second Company. Our suggestions are: First, the recruiting unit should submit a complete list of the recruited workers to the Shenyang Municipal Labor Bureau. Among them, registered workers of various factories, temporary workers who have been transferred to key engineering units, and the captains and trade union cadres in the temporary worker teams should be promptly returned to Shenyang City. Second, it is recommended to give the organizers certain administrative punishments.

### 鬼鬼祟祟的招工者

    鬼鬼祟祟的招工者
    冶金工业部山西太原管道安装总公司第二公司的五名干部，没有办理任何手续，也没有和当地政府取得联系，从三月份开始，就住在沈阳市天聚东旅馆进行招工。到六月初，仅仅招走的水暖工就有三百名左右。
    据我们在皇姑区调查，全区招走的工人共有六十多名，其中许多人是不辞而别。另外据建筑矿山机械厂反映，该厂的长期工人也被拉走了一名。合兴铁工厂的长期工徐忠堂（铆焊工）也被该公司拉走了。在招走的工人中，有不少是我们决定要调给新疆和青海的。
    另外，冶金工业部武汉管道安装总公司第一公司也派计划科长等五、六人于六月初来沈阳，招了一些工人，目前虽然没有走，但是其影响也是很坏的。
    这些招工的干部，为了达到招工的目的，不惜挑拨工人和政府之间的关系，说什么他们那里怎么好，如果当地政府不让去，可以和他们讲道理。因此，工人情绪非常波动，有的竟大骂当地政府。为这件事我们曾三番五次（中央劳动部在沈阳工作的同志也去过两次）找招工的同志提出意见，他们表面承认错误，实际上却一批一批地把工人偷偷的打发走了。他们怕当地政府阻拦，把工人的行李拿到北站去托运，让工人从小站上车，神出鬼没，简直不像国家企业工作人员的样子。
    沈阳市是五金机械工人较多的城市。我们从来也没有表示过不支援新建地区，事实上过去经政府有计划调配到外地去的工人是很多的，有些工人还是从现有厂矿企业中抽调的。但是我们坚决反对这样目无组织、乱抓一把的做法。我们要求上级政府对以上这两个单位，特别是太原管道第二公司进行适当的处理。我们的意见是：第一，招工的单位应当将所招走的工人名单如数抄报沈阳市劳动局。其中属于各厂的在册工人、已调入重点工程单位的临时工人，临时工人队中的队长和工会干部，均应及时送回沈阳市。第二，建议给主办人以一定的行政处分。　　　　沈阳市劳动局
