　　Making Things Difficult for the "Wise Men"

　　The North Atlantic Treaty Organization, established purely as an aggressive military bloc in accordance with the United States' Cold War policy, has recently embarked on a not-so-simple task: to transform itself into a "kind grandmother"—or what the U.S. State Department so beautifully calls "non-military development."

　　At the North Atlantic Council meeting held in May, this specific task was assigned to three "wise men": Canadian Foreign Minister Pearson, Norwegian Foreign Minister Lange, and Italian Foreign Minister Martino. The "wise men" were instructed to draft a plan for "cooperation" in political, economic, and cultural fields.

　　However, how could these three representatives from non-leading countries of the pact handle the difficult problems that could not be resolved at the Council meeting? The "wise men" felt embarrassed.

　　Pearson lamented that they were practically "three blind mice."

　　Therefore, before the three "wise men" met, Pearson had to make a trip to Washington to inquire about what brilliant plans Dulles had up his sleeve. But according to the "New York Times," the questions Pearson raised to Dulles were "difficult to answer," and it would be "strange if he wanted to get a clear and affirmative answer." Thus, the three "wise men" were still grasping at straws. The only thing they accomplished at their first meeting was to compile a list of thirty-six questions and formally submit them to the United States and other member states for "inquiry."

　　What exactly are the questions that are making the "wise men" so troubled? The "New York Times" reporter reported that this involves a "fundamental question," which is: does the United States recognize the equal status and national sovereignty of the members of the Atlantic Pact? In other words, "Does the United States really want to consult with its allies before taking action?" And if so, does this "consultation" mean that the United States promises to support the policies unanimously agreed upon by other members of the alliance?

　　The "New York Times" reporter implied that if the Atlantic group is to have a "common" and "unified" policy, it "not only requires the United States to provide money" but also to "give up some freedom in political action." The so-called "freedom" here is Washington's privilege to arbitrarily issue orders, impose its will on its allies, and drive them to serve itself.

　　Will the United States agree to give it up? The "Washington Post" revealed a categorical answer. It reported Dulles's "explanation" to Pearson of the U.S. position: "The United States favors more coordination, but will never accept any procedure that would 'tie our hands' or deprive this country of the power to take 'prompt and decisive action.' We shall not be subject to the veto of any member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, because the United States is a world power, not just a European country. In short, we want Western European countries to give up a certain degree of sovereignty for what we call common (!) interests, but we will never give up a single iota of our own sovereignty."

　　As the Chinese saying goes, "Even a clever housewife cannot cook without rice." Now, the Western "wise men" are facing the same problem. (Xi)

### 难为了“贤人”

    难为了“贤人”
    按照美国的冷战方针、纯粹是作为一个侵略性军事集团建立起来的北大西洋公约组织，最近开始了一项不简单的工作：要把自己改装成“慈祥的外婆”——美国国务院动听地称之为“非军事方面的发展”。
    在五月举行的北大西洋公约理事会会议上，这个具体任务被交给三位“贤人”去做，这三位“贤人”是：加拿大外长皮尔逊、挪威外交大臣兰格和意大利外长马蒂诺。“贤人”受命起草政治、经济和文化方面的“合作”计划。
    可是，在理事会会议上都未能求得解决的难题，叫这三位并非公约首要国家的代表如何处理得了呢？“贤人”们感到为难了。
    皮尔逊感慨地说，他们实际上是做了“三只瞎耗子”。
    因此，在三“贤人”聚会以前，皮尔逊不得不先到华盛顿跑了一趟，打听一下究竟杜勒斯锦囊有何妙计。但据“纽约时报”透露，皮尔逊向杜勒斯提出的问题，都是“难以解答的问题”，他如果想“得到明确肯定的答复的话，那才是奇怪的事”。于是，三“贤人”依然抓瞎。他们在第一次会议中所完成的工作就是排出了三十六个问题，正式向美国和其他成员国提出“询问”。
    究竟是什么问题使“贤人”们如此为难呢？“纽约时报”的记者报道说，这里牵连到一个“基本问题”，这就是：美国承认不承认大西洋公约成员国的平等地位和国家主权。换句话说，“美国是不是真的希望在采取行动以前同它的盟国们商量”，如果是的话，这种“商量”是不是意味着美国答应支持联盟中其他成员国所一致同意的政策？
    “纽约时报”的记者含蓄地说，如果要使大西洋集团有一个“共同的”、“统一的”政策，“不仅需要美国拿出钱来”，而且要“美国放弃在政治行动方面的某些自由”。这里所谓“自由”，就是华盛顿任意发号施令，把自己的意志强加在它的盟国身上，驱使它们替自己服务的特权。
    美国会同意拿出来吗？“华盛顿邮报”透露了一个斩钉截铁的答案。它报道了杜勒斯向皮尔逊“解释”的美国的立场：“美国赞成更协调些，但是决不接受任何会‘绊住我们’或剥夺这个国家采取‘迅速和决定性行动’的权力的程序。我们决不受制于任何北大西洋公约组织成员国的否决权，因为美国是一个世界强国，并非只是一个欧洲国家。总之，我们要西欧国家为了我们所谓的共同（！）利益而放弃某种程度的主权，但是我们决不放弃一丝一毫我们自己的主权。”
    如此这般，中国俗话说，“巧妇难为无米之炊”。现在，西方的“贤人”也碰着同样的难题。　（昔）
