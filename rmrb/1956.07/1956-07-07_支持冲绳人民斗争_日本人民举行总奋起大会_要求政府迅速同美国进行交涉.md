Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, July 4th: More than ten thousand people from all walks of life in Japan held the "National General Uprising Rally to Promote the Resolution of the Okinawa Issue" at Hibiya Park in Tokyo this afternoon.

Under the slogan "People of the whole country unite to defend Okinawa," about forty labor, peace, women's, and student groups participated in the rally. Representatives from all political parties, including the ruling Liberal Democratic Party and the opposition Socialist Party and Communist Party, attended the rally.

Representatives from Okinawa Island took to the stage one after another, angrily denouncing the Price proposal, which advocates expanding the US military base on Okinawa Island, as a threat to the lives, safety, and property rights of Okinawan residents.

Representatives from all walks of life in Japan spoke at the meeting, unanimously supporting the struggle of the Okinawan residents. The conference issued a declaration demanding that the US government realize the heartfelt demands of the Okinawan residents—the four principles of opposing the expansion of military bases, etc.—and returning Okinawa to Japan. The declaration pointed out that a country that ignores the provisions of the United Nations Charter and rules other nations and part of other nations for a long time cannot be allowed. The conference announced that in order to meet the demands of the Okinawan residents, the 80 million people of Japan, regardless of party affiliation or belief, will unite and fight to the end to achieve their goals.

The conference passed resolutions to the United Nations and various countries, stating that the Japanese people cannot remain indifferent to the current situation in which the human rights, freedoms, and safety of life and property of Okinawan residents are violated under US military rule.

The conference also protested to the United States, condemning the US military's requisition of Okinawan land, and demanding the cancellation of the Price proposal.

People from all walks of life in Japan also expressed dissatisfaction with the Japanese government's failure to actively negotiate with the United States. The conference passed a resolution demanding that the Japanese government quickly conduct strong negotiations with the US government to oppose the Price proposal and restore Japan's administrative power over Okinawa.

    支持冲绳人民斗争
    日本人民举行总奋起大会
    要求政府迅速同美国进行交涉
    据新华社4日讯　东京消息：来自日本各阶层一万多名公众今天下午在东京日比谷公园举行了“促进解决冲绳问题国民总奋起大会”。
    在“全国人民团结起来，保卫冲绳”的口号下，约有四十个劳工、和平、妇女和学生团体参加了大会。各个政党，包括执政的自由民主党和在野的社会党、共产党的代表都出席了大会。
    来自冲绳岛的代表们纷纷到主席台上，以激愤的语气控诉主张扩大冲绳岛美军基地的普赖斯建议威胁冲绳居民的生命安全和财产权。
    日本各界代表在会上发言，一致支持冲绳居民的斗争。大会发表了宣言，要求美国政府实现冲绳居民的衷心要求——反对扩大军事基地等四项原则和把冲绳归还日本。宣言指出，一个国家忽视联合国宪章的条款，长期统治其他民族和其他民族的一部分人，是不能被允许的。大会宣布，为了满足冲绳居民的要求，日本八千万国民将不分党派和信仰，团结一致，为贯彻目的而斗争到底。
    大会通过了给联合国和各国的决议，表明日本人民对于冲绳居民的人权、自由和生命财产的安全在美国军事统治之下受到侵犯的现状，不能漠不关心。
    大会并且向美国提出抗议，谴责美军征用冲绳土地，并且要求撤销普赖斯建议。
    日本各界人民也对日本政府没有积极向美国进行交涉，表示不满。大会通过决议，要求日本政府迅速同美国政府进行强有力的交涉，以反对普赖斯建议，恢复日本对冲绳的施政权。（附图片）
