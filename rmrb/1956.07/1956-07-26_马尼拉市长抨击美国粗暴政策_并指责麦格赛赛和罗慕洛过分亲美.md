Xinhua News Agency, Manila: Manila Mayor Arsenio Lacson delivered a speech on the 23rd, fiercely criticizing the crude foreign policy implemented by the United States in Asia, and accusing Philippine President Magsaysay and Philippine Ambassador to the United States Romulo of being excessively pro-American.

He said: "The crude foreign policy of the United States in Asia is causing it to lose many friends, and this policy is symbolized by the increasingly clumsy Dulles."

"The United States can never hope to win the friendship of the Asian people through high-pressure politics and financial handouts."

Lacson accused American soldiers of "humiliating Filipinos." However, Lacson also said that he does not approve of the withdrawal of American troops from the Philippines because they are "the guarantee of our security."

Lacson criticized Magsaysay's "excessive pro-Americanism." He said: "Ironically, this has only earned him the minimum amount of American aid."

He said that Romulo recently said that Filipinos never knew freedom until the United States gave the Philippines freedom, and he was "unaware of historical facts" when he said this. "Romulo's sin against the Philippines is his loyalty to the United States."

    马尼拉市长抨击美国粗暴政策
    并指责麦格赛赛和罗慕洛过分亲美
    据新华社讯　马尼拉消息：马尼拉市长阿塞尼奥·拉克森二十三日发表演说，猛烈抨击美国在亚洲实行的粗鲁的外交政策，并且指责菲律宾总统麦格赛赛和菲律宾驻美大使罗慕洛过于亲美。
    他说：“美国在亚洲的粗鲁的外交政策正在使得它丧失许多朋友，而这个政策是以越来越笨拙的杜勒斯来作为象征的。”
      “美国永远不能希望用高压政治和财政施舍来赢得亚洲人民的友谊。”
    拉克森指责美国军人“凌辱菲律宾人”。不过，拉克森又说，他不赞成美国军队从菲律宾撤退，因为他们是“我们安全的保证”。
    拉克森批评了麦格赛赛的“过分的亲美主义”。他说：“成为讽刺的是，这却使得他只能得到最低限度的美国援助”。
    他说，罗慕洛最近说在美国给予菲律宾自由以前，菲律宾人从来不知道自由，他讲这番话的时候是“不知道历史事实”。“罗慕洛对菲律宾所犯的罪过就是他对美国的忠诚。”
