    Geneva Four-Power Summit Conference
    Today marks the anniversary of when the heads of government of the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France—Bulganin, Eisenhower, Eden, and Faure—began their six-day meeting in Geneva. This was the first meeting of the heads of state of the major powers since the Potsdam Conference in 1945.
    Since the end of World War II, the relations between the countries that were once allies in the struggle against the common enemy of fascism have deteriorated. However, the Soviet Union has consistently strived for international cooperation, advocating for the resolution of international issues through consultation, in order to ease international tensions. This effort by the Soviet Union has been supported by peace-loving countries and peoples. People of all countries strongly demanded the holding of a summit conference of the major powers to discuss and resolve major international issues, further strengthen peace, and eliminate the danger of atomic war. Under these circumstances, the U.S. government changed its original attitude of staunchly opposing the convocation of a summit conference of the major powers, and the governments of the United States, Britain, and France suggested on May 10th of last year that a four-power summit conference be arranged, to which the Soviet Union immediately agreed. Therefore, the convocation of the Geneva Four-Power Summit Conference was a definite achievement for the forces of peace.
    According to the agreed-upon agenda, the conference discussed: 1. the German question; 2. the European security question; 3. the question of disarmament and the prohibition of atomic weapons; 4. the question of developing contacts between East and West. The United States maliciously raised the so-called "issue of Eastern European countries" and the "issue of international communism," but it was not adopted and included in the agenda. Even Britain and France expressed great indifference to such issues.
    The Soviet delegation stated at the beginning of the meeting that the purpose of the conference was not to blame each other, but to build trust and cooperation. U.S. President Eisenhower also expressed his willingness to "find a basis for reconciliation." This spirit of understanding and cooperation became an important feature of the conference. "Cold war" and war policies were condemned at the meeting.
    The conference was unable to eliminate the existing differences on specific issues.
    The Soviet Union put forward practical and feasible proposals and propositions at the meeting: the conclusion of an all-European treaty guaranteeing collective security in Europe, and the abolition of military blocs; the solution of the German question should be achieved through the cooperation and rapprochement of the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany; all countries should reach the necessary agreement on the issues of reducing conventional arms, prohibiting atomic weapons, and supervision; the four major powers should now guarantee not to be the first to use atomic weapons and hydrogen weapons; and extensive contacts and cooperation should be implemented between countries.
    However, the three Western countries did not accept the reasonable proposals of the Soviet Union. They stubbornly insisted that the issue of German reunification must be resolved first before a European collective security system could be established; and the method they proposed for restoring German reunification required the incorporation of the German Democratic Republic into West Germany, and this "unified" Germany would also participate in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. On the issue of disarmament, they also did not take a step forward from their original positions. Eisenhower's "Open Skies" plan, put forward at this meeting, became the main shield for the United States to obstruct breaking the deadlock on the disarmament issue later on.
    However, due to the spirit of cooperation and understanding shown in general by all parties participating in the meeting, the conference still achieved important results. The conference adopted instructions to the foreign ministers of the four countries, instructing the foreign ministers to "continue to consider the issues on which the heads of state had exchanged views, and to propose effective solutions, in the spirit of contributing to easing international tensions and consolidating trust among countries."
    The instructions also affirmed some principles on various issues, believing that "the close connection between the reunification of Germany and the European security issue should be taken into account, as well as the fact that the successful resolution of each of these issues will be conducive to consolidating peace"; "the heads of government of the four countries hope to eliminate the threat of war and reduce the burden of armaments"; "it should be possible (a) to promote the gradual elimination of obstacles hindering the free movement of people and peaceful trade between countries, (b) to promote freer contacts and exchanges that are mutually beneficial to the countries and peoples concerned." These principles and opinions are very important and beneficial.
    Before and after the meeting, personal contacts between government leaders also produced other important results. The leaders of the Soviet Union and Britain discussed the issue of strengthening relations between the two countries, and Eden invited the Soviet leaders to visit Britain. In order to strengthen Soviet-French relations, the Soviet Union also invited the French leaders to visit the Soviet Union. Now, after these visits, the relations between the Soviet Union, Britain, and France have greatly improved.
    The spirit of understanding and cooperation manifested at the Geneva Conference and the principle affirmed by the conference of condemning the use of war as a means of resolving international disputes and advocating peaceful coexistence through consultation to resolve all international issues, was later called the "Geneva Spirit" and became an important guideline with a wide-ranging influence on international relations.

### 日内瓦四国首脑会议

    日内瓦四国首脑会议
    去年的今天，苏、美、英、法四国政府首脑布尔加宁、艾森豪威尔、艾登、富尔，开始在日内瓦举行为期六天的会议。这是大国首脑自从1945年波茨坦会议以来的第一次会晤。
    自从第二次世界大战结束后，过去在反对法西斯主义这一共同敌人的斗争中结成盟友的国家，彼此的关系恶化了。但是，苏联一直努力争取国际合作，主张协商解决国际问题，以缓和国际紧张局势。苏联的这个努力，得到了爱好和平的国家和人民的支持。各国人民强烈地要求举行大国首脑会议，协商解决重大的国际问题，进一步加强和平，消除原子战争的危险。在这种情况下，美国政府改变了它原来坚决反对召开大国首脑会议的态度，美、英、法三国政府于去年五月十日建议安排举行四国首脑会议，苏联立即表示同意。因此，日内瓦四国首脑会议的召开，是和平力量的肯定的成就。
    根据一致协议的议程，会议讨论了：一、德国问题；二、欧洲安全问题；三、裁减军备和禁止原子武器问题；四、发展东西方之间的接触问题。美国曾不怀好意地提出所谓“东欧国家问题”和“国际共产主义问题”，但未被采纳列入议程，甚至英法两国也对这种问题表示十分冷淡。
    苏联代表团在会议开始时就说，会议的目的不是互相指责，而是建立信任和合作。美国总统艾森豪威尔也表示愿意“寻找和解的基础”。这种谅解和合作的精神成为这次会议的重要特征。“冷战”和战争政策在会上受到了谴责。
    会议在具体的问题上没有能够消除存在着的分歧。
    苏联在会上分别提出了切实可行的建议和主张：缔结保障欧洲集体安全的全欧条约，取消军事集团；德国问题的解决，应通过德意志民主共和国和德意志联邦共和国的合作和相互接近来实现；各国应该就裁减常规武装、禁止原子武器和监督的问题达成必要的协议，四大国现在就保证不首先使用原子武器和氢武器；各国之间实行广泛的接触和合作。
    但西方三国没有接受苏联的合理建议。它们硬说必须先解决德国统一问题，才能建立欧洲集体安全体系；而它们提出的恢复德国统一的办法又要求把德意志民主共和国并入西德，并且这样“统一”了的德国还要参加北大西洋公约。在裁军问题上，它们也没有从它们原来的立场上前进一步。艾森豪威尔在这次会上提出的“开放天空”计划，成为了美国后来阻挠打开裁军问题僵局的主要挡箭牌。
    但是，由于参加会议各方在总的方面表现的合作和谅解的精神，会议仍然取得了重要的结果。会议通过了给四国外长的指示，责成外长们“本着对缓和国际紧张局势和巩固各国间的信任作出贡献的愿望”，继续考虑首脑们交换过意见的问题，并且提出解决的有效办法。
    指示还对各项问题肯定了一些原则，认为“应该考虑到重新统一德国和欧洲安全问题之间的密切联系，以及这些问题中的每一个问题的成功解决将有利于巩固和平这一事实”；“四国政府首脑，希望消除战争的威胁和减轻军备的负担”；“应当能够（甲）促成逐步消除妨碍各国人民之间的自由往来和和平贸易的障碍，（乙）促成对有关国家和人民相互有利的更自由的接触和交流”。这些原则意见都是很重要的，有益的。
    在会议前后，政府领导人个人之间的接触还产生了另外的重要结果。苏英两国领导人讨论了加强两国关系的问题，艾登邀请苏联领导人访问英国。苏联为加强苏法关系，也邀请了法国领导人访问苏联。现在，经过这些访问，苏、英、法的关系大大改善了。
    日内瓦会议所表现的谅解和合作的精神和会议所肯定的谴责以战争作为解决国际争端的手段和主张协商解决一切国际问题的和平共处思想，后来被称为“日内瓦精神”，成为影响广大的指导国际关系的重要准则。　　（翁祖尧）
