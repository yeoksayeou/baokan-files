Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, 15th: Anhui Province's nine million mu of double-cropping early rice has begun to be harvested. The yield per mu is generally over 400 jin, with some reaching as high as 700 jin. The average yield per unit area has increased by 30% compared to last year.

This year, the area of double-cropping early rice in Anhui Province has increased by more than 6 million mu compared to last year. In addition to the increase in yield per unit area, the province is expected to increase rice production by more than 2.7 billion jin compared to last year.

The bumper harvest of early rice has encouraged farmers' enthusiasm for increasing production. They are harvesting the early rice and rushing to transplant late rice seedlings from early morning to late at night.

Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, 14th: Anhui Province has completed the summer sowing of oil crops such as soybeans, peanuts, and sesame. This year, the province has sown a total of 21.05 million mu of soybeans, peanuts, and sesame, exceeding the quota by 3%, completing the plan to expand the planting of oil crops, and exceeding the highest historical figure of 1953 by 1.9 million mu.

In order to strive to complete the sowing plan for oil crops, agricultural production cooperatives in various places used the method of increasing the multiple cropping area, intercropping and mixed cropping 3.14 million mu of soybeans and sesame in high-yield crops such as corn and sweet potatoes. The farmers along the Huai River, who are rich in oil crops, overcame waterlogging, planting repeatedly despite being flooded multiple times, draining and planting simultaneously, and finally enabled the province to complete the sowing plan with an excess.

Currently, the early-sown soybeans have blossomed and set pods, and the peanuts have also germinated. Agricultural cooperatives are weeding, topdressing, and controlling pests to strive for a bumper harvest.

    安徽早稻预计可增产二十七亿多斤
    大豆花生等油料作物播种面积大大超过往年
    新华社合肥15日电　安徽省九百万亩双季早稻已开始收割，每亩产量一般都在四百斤以上，有的高达七百多斤。平均单位面积产量比去年增产三成。
    今年安徽省的双季早稻面积比去年增加了六百多万亩，再加单位面积产量的提高，预计全省将比去年增产二十七亿多斤稻谷。
    早稻丰收，鼓舞了农民的增产积极性。他们起早带晚的抢收早稻和赶栽晚秧。
    新华社合肥14日电　安徽省夏季播种大豆、花生、芝麻等油料作物已经结束。今年全省播种的大豆、花生、芝麻共达二千一百○五万亩，超额3％，完成了扩大种植油料作物的计划，比历史上最多的1953年还多一百九十万亩。
    各地农业生产合作社为力争完成油料作物的播种计划，用增加复种面积的办法，在玉米、山芋等高产作物地里套种、混种了三百一十四万亩大豆和芝麻。盛产油料的淮河沿岸的农民，曾战胜内涝，数淹数种，边排边种，终使全省播种计划超额完成。
    现在，早种的大豆已经开花结荚，花生也已经生芽。各农业社正在锄草、追肥和除治虫害，争取丰收。
