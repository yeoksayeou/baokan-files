    A Short Note on the Buddha's Tooth

    Last October, the Burmese Buddhist delegation escorted the Buddha's tooth from Beijing to Rangoon; this June, our Chinese Buddhist delegation escorted the Buddha's tooth back to China. These are two major events for the Buddhist communities of China and Burma. This event has also aroused widespread interest.
    According to Buddhist scriptures, when Sakyamuni, the founder of Buddhism, passed away more than two thousand years ago, he left behind four teeth, one of which was introduced to China very early on. In 963 AD (the seventh year of the Tianhui reign of the Northern Han Dynasty), a Chinese eminent monk brought this Buddha's tooth to Beijing. In 1071 AD (the seventh year of the Xianyong reign of the Liao Dynasty), Zheng, the mother of Chancellor Yelü Renxian, the Lady of Yan, built a thirteen-story octagonal pagoda in the Western Hills of Beijing and preserved the Buddha's tooth under the base of the pagoda. The small wooden box containing the Buddha's tooth was engraved with the words "Relic of Sakyamuni Buddha's Spiritual Tooth," "April 23rd, the seventh year of Tianhui," and Sanskrit mantras. In 1900, the "Eight-Nation Alliance" of imperialist powers invaded Beijing. The pagoda was destroyed by the invaders' artillery fire, but the Buddha's tooth, buried deep under the pagoda's base, was not damaged. Afterwards, monks from the nearby Lingguang Temple dug out the Buddha's tooth along with the wooden box and continued to enshrine it in the Lingguang Temple.
    In the spring of 1955, the Chinese Buddhist Association brought the Buddha's tooth to Guangji Temple in Beijing and placed it inside a golden seven-jeweled pagoda weighing about 153 kilograms and inlaid with 861 pearls and gemstones.
    Burmese Buddhists have long cherished the desire to pay homage to the Buddha's tooth in China. Nearly a thousand years ago, during the reign of King Anawrahta of Burma, China sent a delicate model of the Buddha's tooth to Burma. It is still deeply enshrined in the Shwe Zigone Pagoda in Mandalay as a precious treasure. In October 1955, a Burmese Buddhist delegation led by U Myint Thein, Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the Union of Burma, accompanied by the Chinese Buddha's Tooth Escort Delegation, escorted the Buddha's tooth from Beijing to Rangoon to allow Burmese Buddhists to pay homage for a period. The hope of Burmese Buddhists to pay homage to the Buddha's tooth in China for over a thousand years has finally become a reality today, with the ever-growing friendship between China and Burma.
    In June of this year, our Chinese Buddhist delegation escorted the Buddha's tooth back to China from Burma. In order to meet the demands of the Dai ethnic Buddhists in Yunnan, the Chinese Buddhist Association has now dispatched a "Buddha's Tooth Protection Delegation" to transport the Buddha's tooth to the Dai area for a period of touring display. The fact that the Buddha's tooth is valued and worshiped by Buddhists of all ethnic groups in our country convincingly demonstrates that the religious freedom rights of Buddhists of all ethnic groups in our country, like those of believers of other religions, are effectively protected by the People's Government.

    佛牙小记
    马良
    去年十月，缅甸佛教代表团将佛牙从北京奉迎到仰光；今年六月，我国佛教代表团将佛牙奉迎回国。这是中、缅两国佛教界的两件大事。这件事也引起人们的广泛的兴趣。
    据佛经记载，在两千数百年以前，佛教的创始人释迦牟尼逝世的时候，曾留下了四颗牙齿，其中有一颗很早就传入了我国。公元963年（北汉天会七年），我国高僧曾经将这颗佛牙迎到北京。公元1071年（辽咸雍七年），宰相耶律仁先的母亲燕国太夫人郑氏在北京的西山建造了一座十三层的八棱塔，将佛牙保藏在塔基的下面。装盛佛牙的小木匣上，刻有“释迦佛灵牙舍利”、“天会七年四月二十三日”和梵文咒语等文字。1900年，帝国主义的“八国联军”侵犯北京，这个塔为侵略者的炮火所轰毁，但是，佛牙深藏在塔基的下面，没有被毁坏。事后，邻近的灵光寺的僧人连木匣将佛牙挖出，一直供养在灵光寺内。
    1955年春季，中国佛教协会将佛牙迎到北京广济寺，装盛在一座重约153公斤，镶有珍珠、宝石861块的金质七宝塔内。
    缅甸佛教徒从久远以来就怀着瞻拜中国佛牙的愿望。近一千年前，在缅甸阿那律陀皇朝时代，我国曾将一个精致的佛牙的模型送给缅甸。它被当作珍贵的宝物至今还深藏在曼德勒的瑞金英塔内。1955年10月间，以缅甸联邦最高法院院长吴登貌为首的缅甸佛教代表团在中国佛牙护送团的陪同下，将我国的佛牙从北京奉迎到仰光，供缅甸佛教徒作一个时期的朝拜。缅甸佛教徒千余年来朝拜我国佛牙的希望，终于在中缅两国的友谊有了日益发展的今天变成了现实。
    今年六月中，我国佛教代表团将佛牙自缅甸奉迎回国。为了满足云南傣族佛教徒的要求，现在中国佛教协会已派遣了一个“佛牙护侍团”，准备把佛牙运往傣族地区巡行一个时期。佛牙受到重视并受到我国各族佛教徒朝拜的事实，令人信服地说明了，我国各族佛教徒与我国其他宗教的信徒一样，他们的宗教信仰自由的权利是得到了人民政府的切实的保护的。
