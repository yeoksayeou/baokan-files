Xinhua News Agency, July 17th -- The Ministry of Supervision and the Ministry of Food of the People's Republic of China recently jointly issued a notice to the Supervision Bureaus and Food Bureaus of all provinces (autonomous regions) and municipalities regarding grain supervision work for the second half of 1956.

    The notice stated, "In the first half of 1956, supervision organs at all levels, in conjunction with food departments, conducted key inspections of grain storage, transportation, processing, and supply, particularly a large-scale general survey of grain storage work. The results of this survey indicate that grain storage work has improved in many respects, and losses and waste have decreased compared to the same period last year. However, many serious problems still exist, and some have not yet been properly resolved.”

    The notice pointed out: "In the second half of 1956, supervision organs and food departments at all levels must closely cooperate to continue strengthening the inspection and re-inspection of grain storage work; during the summer and autumn grain purchase and storage seasons, efforts should also be concentrated on inspecting purchase and storage work."

    The notice said that grain is easily infested with insects and moldy in the summer, and all regions should focus on checking whether the problems left over from the general survey have been resolved, especially paying attention to the handling of insect-infested grain, high-moisture grain, and the repair of granaries, and urging the preparation of necessary conditions for grain to safely survive the summer. The work of developing and consolidating "four-free" grain depots should also be inspected.

    During the summer and autumn grain purchase work, all regions should inspect the implementation of the policy of "pricing according to quality and paying premium prices for high quality" by purchasing units and personnel, and prevent and correct violations of policies such as failure to carefully inspect grain quality, suppression of grades and prices, and underweighing to ensure that the state purchases high-quality grain.

    加强下半年粮食监察工作  
    监察部和粮食部联合发出通知
    据新华社17日讯　中华人民共和国监察部和粮食部最近联合向各省（区）、市监察厅、局和粮食厅、局发出关于1956年下半年粮食监察工作的通知。
    通知说“1956年上半年各地监察机关会同粮食部门对粮食保管、调运、加工、供应等工作进行了重点检查，特别是对粮食保管工作进行了大规模的普查。从这次普查的结果看，粮食保管工作有了不少改进，损失浪费现象较去年同时期有所减少，但是依然存在着许多严重问题，而且有的直到现在还未很好地予以解决。
    通知指出：1956年下半年各地监察机关和粮食部门必须密切配合，继续加强对粮食保管工作的检查和复查；在夏粮、秋粮收购入库时，还应集中力量检查收购工作和入库工作。
    通知说，粮食在夏季很容易虫蚀和霉变，各地对粮食保管工作应着重检查对普查中遗留的问题已否解决，特别要注意处理虫害粮、高水分粮和修缮仓房的情况，督促为粮食安全度夏准备好必要的条件。对开展与巩固“四无”粮仓的工作也要进行检查。
    各地在夏粮、秋粮收购工作中，应检查收购单位和人员执行“依质论价，优质优价”政策的情况，防止和纠正不认真检验粮质，压级压价和压秤等违反政策的行为，保证国家买进质量好的粮食。
