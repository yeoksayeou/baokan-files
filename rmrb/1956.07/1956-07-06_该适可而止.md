    It's Time to Stop
    In July and August of last year, more than ten people suspected of embezzlement in the grass-roots supply and marketing cooperatives of Pingli County, Shaanxi Province, were transferred to the county supply and marketing cooperative and suspended from their duties for self-reflection. However, almost a year has passed, and they are still suspended for self-reflection, some of whom are actually just suspended and have not reflected at all. As a result, they are eating and drinking their fill all day long, without any purpose. This procrastinating style of dealing with problems should stop.

    该适可而止
    去年七、八月间，陕西平利县各基层供销社曾有十多个有贪污嫌疑的人，被调到县供销社停职反省。但将近一年多了，他们还在停职反省中，有的人实际上只是停职，并未反省。结果是饱食终日，无所用心。这种处理问题的拖拉作风应该适可而止了。　（毅力）
