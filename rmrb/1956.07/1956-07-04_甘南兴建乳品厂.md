    Lanzhou dispatch from our newspaper: A modern Gannan Dairy Factory is being built in Hezuo City, Gannan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Gansu Province. The factory's mechanical and sanitary equipment is manufactured by absorbing the advantages of several Shanghai milk powder factories. When it is fully put into production next year, the annual output can reach more than 500 tons.
    Gannan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture is the main pastoral area of Gansu Province. After liberation, with the development of animal husbandry, milk production also increased. However, because milk is not easy to store and transport, it often sours and spoils. After the dairy factory is completed, milk can be processed into milk powder and transported to various places.

    甘南兴建乳品厂
    本报兰州电　在甘肃省甘南藏族自治州的合作市，正在着手修建一个现代化的甘南乳品厂。这个工厂的机械卫生设备是吸收了上海几个奶粉厂的优点制造出来的。明年全部投入生产后，年产量可以达到五百多吨。
    甘南藏族自治州是甘肃省的主要牧区。解放后随着畜牧业的发展，牛奶产量也跟着增加。但因为牛奶不易贮藏和外运，常常发酸腐坏。乳品厂建成后，牛奶将可加工成奶粉运往各地。
