Xinhua News Agency, Yumen, July 20th: In order to adapt to the new situation of the rapid development of the national petroleum industry, the Yumen Oilfield is massively training technical personnel for the national petroleum industry. According to the plan, from the beginning of this year to the end of March next year, the Yumen Oilfield will train a total of 243 teams in eight different types of work, including drilling, oil testing, and geological exploration. It will also train thousands of technical workers in oil extraction, oil refining, mechanical installation, civil construction, power generation, and other types of work. After these teams and technical workers have been trained, some will remain to work in the Yumen Oilfield, while the rest will be transferred to support national petroleum industry departments.
	Various units of the Yumen Oilfield have set up technical training classes and workshops and organized new and veteran workers to sign apprenticeship contracts. By the end of June, the entire oilfield had held 191 technical training classes and workshops, with more than 9,500 people participating in the training; more than 8,000 pairs of apprenticeship contracts had been signed throughout the oilfield. Many veteran workers have actively helped new workers to quickly master technology after signing apprenticeship contracts. For example, in the past, units such as the drilling company and oil production plant needed six months to train an apprentice to become a Level 3 technician. This year, with the help of veteran workers, many apprentices in these units became Level 3 technicians after only two to three months of study. By the end of June, according to incomplete statistics from the entire oilfield, more than 1,290 apprentices had been promoted to technicians, and more than 4,390 technicians had been promoted to higher grades.

    玉门油矿大规模培养技术人材
    新华社玉门20日电　为适应全国石油工业迅速发展的新情况，玉门油矿正在大规模地为全国石油工业培养训练技术人材。根据计划，从今年年初到明年三月底止，玉门油矿要培养训练出包括有钻井，试油、地质勘探等八个不同工种的队共243队，还要培养训练出几千名采油、炼油、机械安装、土木建筑、发电等工种的技术工人。这些队和技术工人经过培养训练以后，除一部分留在玉门油矿工作外，其余将全部调出去支援全国石油工业部门。
    玉门油矿各个单位都举办了技术训练班、讲习班，组织新老工人签订了师徒合同。到六月底止，全矿已经举办了各种技术训练班和讲习班191班，有九千五百多人参加了学习；全矿签订的师徒合同达八千多对。许多老工人在签订师徒合同后，都积极帮助新工人加速掌握技术。如钻井公司、采油厂等单位，过去把一个学徒培养成为一个三级技术工人，要经过六个月。今年，这些单位有许多学徒工在老工人的帮助下，只经过两个多月到三个月的学习时间，就成为三级技术工人了。到六月底止，全矿不完全的统计，已经有一千二百九十多名学徒工，升为技术工人；还有四千三百九十多名技术工人升了级。
