    Yangtze River Shipping Administration Fails to Complete Transportation Plan
    Tens of Thousands of Tons of Goods Backlogged at Various Ports Along the River
    (Our Dispatch) The Yangtze River Shipping Administration only completed 88.8% of its freight turnover plan for the first half of the year. A large number of ships are congested in ports along the river, and tens of thousands of tons of goods are piled up at various ports along the river, unable to be shipped out.
    Currently, the total carrying capacity of ships participating in transportation on the entire Yangtze River is 280,000 tons. From July 1st to 4th, more than 150,000 to 160,000 tons of transport capacity was congested in various ports every day. Currently, the transport capacity congested in various ports still reaches 140,000 to 150,000 tons. Among them, Shanghai Port has the most serious backlog, with more than 50,000 tons; Hankou and Yichang each have more than 30,000 tons; and Chongqing has more than 20,000 tons. Only a small number of these ships parked in the ports are loading and unloading, and most of them are idle waiting for cargo. According to the Chief Dispatcher of the Yangtze River Shipping Administration, these figures are not comprehensive, and the actual backlog of transport capacity is far greater than these figures.
    According to the Business Department of the Yangtze River Shipping Administration, the goods currently backlogged at various ports awaiting shipment include: more than 20,000 tons of steel, oil, coal, and live pigs from Chongqing; more than 29,000 tons of upstream cargo from Yichang; more than 30,000 tons of upstream cargo and about 10,000 tons of downstream cargo from Hankou.
    The reasons why a large number of ships of the Yangtze River Shipping Administration are congested in the ports, failing to complete the transportation plan on the one hand and causing a large backlog of goods on the other hand, are mainly that the leading organizations from the Yangtze River Shipping Administration to the various branch bureaus and ports have not concentrated their main forces on managing production, and the planning and dispatching work have not been grasped tightly. Many problems at the lower levels have not been resolved for a long time. All ports lack equipment and labor. As a result, when ships arrive, there is no one to unload the goods, or after the goods are unloaded, there is no place to stack them, so they have to wait. It is understood that since liberation, the ports have not added a single new barge. The ports lack warehouses and tugboats. Chongqing Port uses wooden barges to stack the goods unloaded from the ships. The Yangtze River Shipping Administration originally planned to stack goods on wooden barges for a maximum of three days. Now, in reality, they are stacked for an average of four and a half days. Naturally, later ships cannot unload their cargo. When planning this year's production, the Yangtze River Shipping Administration planned that each port should rely on tapping production potential and increasing mechanical equipment to achieve an average efficiency of 9.137 tons per worker per shift for loading and unloading across the entire line (last year, the average efficiency per worker per shift across the entire line was 6.499 tons). However, the actual implementation result is that due to weak production leadership and improper dispatching in various ports, and mechanical equipment has not been added in time; the accumulation of goods has increased the transportation distance, and the actual work-shift efficiency of the entire line in the first half of the year has not reached the plan by far. The average work-shift efficiency of the entire line from January to May this year was only 6.544 tons. The situation did not improve in July.
    In addition, the failure of the shipyards to repair ships on time, reducing transportation capacity, is also one of the reasons for the failure to complete the transportation plan and the accumulation of goods. Currently, the ships waiting to be repaired in the shipyards include seventeen passenger and cargo ships, with a total carrying capacity of 6,000 tons, which is more than 2,600 tons more than the planned number of repairs; ten cargo ships, with a total carrying capacity of 11,000 tons, which is more than 3,900 tons more than the planned number of repairs; thirty-six barges, with a total carrying capacity of 21,000 tons, which is 300 tons more than the planned number of repairs; and twenty-six tugboats, with 3,200 more horsepower than the planned number of repairs.

### 长江航运管理局完不成运输计划  数万吨物资积压在沿线各港

    长江航运管理局完不成运输计划
    数万吨物资积压在沿线各港
    本报讯　长江航运管理局上半年货运周转计划，只完成了88.8％，大批船只拥塞在沿线各港，数万吨物资堆积在沿线各港运不出去。
    长江全线现在参加运输的船只共有载重能力二十八万吨，七月一日至四日，每天有十五、六万多吨运力拥塞在各港，目前拥塞在各港的运力仍达十四、五万吨。其中上海港积压最严重，有五万多吨；汉口、宜昌各有三万多吨；重庆两万多吨。这些停在港口的船只只有很少数在进行装卸，大多数都闲着等待装货。据长江航运管理局总调度师称：这些数字还不全面，实际积压的运力远比这些数字多。
    据长江航运管理局商务部门谈：现在积压在各港待运而运不出去的货物计有：重庆钢材、油脂、煤、生猪等二万多吨，宜昌上水货二万九千多吨，汉口上水货三万多吨，下水货一万吨左右。
    长江航运管理局大批船只拥塞在港口，一方面完不成运输计划，一方面把大批物资积压下来的原因，主要是从长江航运管理局起至各分局、各港的领导机构都没有集中主要力量管理生产，计划工作、调度工作都抓得不紧，下面的许多问题长期不能解决，各个港口都缺设备，缺劳动力，因而船来了无人卸货或卸了货，无处堆放，只好等待。据了解，自解放以来港口的囤船就没有添过一个新的。港口的仓库、拖轮都不够。重庆港是用木驳堆放从船上卸下的货物的，长江航运管理局原计划货物在木驳上最多堆三天。现在，实际上平均要堆存四天半。后来的船，自然就无法卸货了。长江航运管理局在规划今年生产的时候，曾经计划各港要依靠挖掘生产潜力和增加机械设备，使全线装卸的每工每班效率平均达到9.137吨（去年全线平均每工每班效率为6.499吨）。但是实际执行结果，由于各港生产领导薄弱，调度不当，机械设备没有及时增添；货物积压多了，又加长了运输距离，全线上半年的实际工班效率远远没有达到计划，全线今年一至五月份平均工班效率只达到6.544吨。七月份情况也没有好转。
    另外，修船厂不能按时把船只修好，减少了运输能力，也是完不成运输计划、造成物资积压的原因之一。现在在船厂待修的船只计有客货轮十七艘，共可载货六千吨，比计划中应修理数多了二千六百多吨；货轮十艘，共可载货一万一千多吨，比计划应修理数多了三千九百多吨；驳船三十六艘，共可载货二万一千多吨，比计划应修理数多三百吨；拖轮二十六艘，比计划应修理数多了三千二百多马力。　（曹厚德）
