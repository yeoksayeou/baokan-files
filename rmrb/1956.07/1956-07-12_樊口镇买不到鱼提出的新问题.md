    New Problems Raised by Not Being Able to Buy Fish in Fankou Town
    Gu Weijin
    Recently, some rural staff members and I came to Fankou Town in Echeng County, Hubei Province, eager to buy some of the local specialty, bream. However, after searching the entire town, we couldn't find any, nor could we find any other fish.
    Later, we learned what was happening: the district aquatic products station stipulated that the fish caught by fishermen (including those who occasionally fish) must be sold through the aquatic products station and cannot be sold privately. However, the price offered by the aquatic products station was quite low. The fishermen were very dissatisfied, so fish were often unavailable in the market.
    During dinner, everyone discussed the unreasonable regulations imposed on the fishermen by the aquatic products station. One comrade suddenly slammed his chopsticks on the table and exclaimed, "It's all because the district was abolished; otherwise, with the district committee in place, the aquatic products station wouldn't dare to act so recklessly!" "That's right," another comrade echoed, "now that there's no district committee, many financial and economic cadres often only consider their own work when handling matters, regardless of policy and the interests of the masses." When everyone quieted down a bit, a comrade surnamed Sun calmly offered a different perspective: "After the district-level establishment was abolished, the financial and economic departments in the district, lacking the leadership of the district committee, did indeed encounter some problems. However, we can't say that abolishing the district-level establishment was wrong. There are many benefits to abolishing the district-level establishment. Take us district cadres, for example; isn't it because the district-level establishment was abolished that we've been freed from many unnecessary administrative tasks, allowing us to concentrate on going deep into the countryside to strengthen leadership in agricultural cooperativization and agricultural production? The problem lies in the fact that the county didn't give enough comprehensive consideration to this new work of abolishing the district-level establishment and acted somewhat hastily!" Lao Sun was one of the former district leaders and was very clear about the county's abolition of the district-level establishment in April of this year. He recalled the situation at the time, saying: "When the county received instructions from above to abolish the district-level establishment, some Party and administrative leaders didn't give good consideration to what preparatory work should be done beforehand, what problems might arise afterward, and how they should be resolved. They simply issued a notice of abolishing the district-level establishment based on the instructions from above, thinking they had completed the task. Because of this, some problems arose in the financial and economic departments after the district-level establishment was abolished. The problems don't stop there; the broad masses of rural cadres and people felt that abolishing the district-level establishment was very inconvenient, and they often traveled a long way from the countryside to the county people's committee to request solutions to problems, either not finding anyone or finding no one to take responsibility."
    A few days later, as I was about to leave Fankou Town, a financial and economic guidance group sent by the county committee and county people's committee arrived. Their task was to strengthen policy guidance for the district's financial and economic departments and to represent the county people's committee in handling problems raised by the masses in the countryside. This direct approach to solving problems at the grassroots level is excellent, and we hope it can be sustained. However, what kind of working methods and organizational forms can better adapt to the actual needs after the abolition of the district-level establishment? This remains to be solved by Party organizations in various localities in their future practical work.

    樊口镇买不到鱼提出的新问题
    古维进
    最近，我和几个乡村工作人员来到湖北省鄂城县樊口镇，很想买一点这里的名产鳊鱼。可是，跑遍街道，买不到这种鱼，而且，其他的鱼也买不到。
    以后才知道是这么回事：这里的区水产站规定渔民（包括偶然捕鱼的人）的鱼必须经过水产站出卖，不能自销，而水产站收购鱼的价格又定得较低。渔民们很不满意，市上便经常买不到鱼。
    吃晚饭的时候，大家扯起水产站对渔民定的这些不合理的规定来。一个同志忽然把筷子往桌上一摔，大声说：“都是因为撤销了区；要不然，有区委在，水产站敢这样胡来！”“对呀，”另一个同志附和着，现在没有区委了，很多财经部门干部办起事情来，常常只考虑自己的业务，而不管政策和群众的利益。当大家稍稍静下来的时候，一位姓孙的同志慢条斯理地提出了和大家不同的看法：“撤销区级建制之后，区里的财经部门没有区委的领导，确实发生了一些问题。但是，不能说撤销区级建制不对。撤销区级建制，有很多好处。就拿现在咱们这些区干部来说，不就是因为撤销了区级建制，才摆脱了许多不必要的事务工作，集中精力深入乡里加强对农业合作化和农业生产的领导吗？问题在于县里对待撤销区级建制这一新的工作考虑得不够全面，多少有些潦草从事！”老孙是过去区里的负责人之一，对于今年四月间县里进行撤销区级建制的情况知道的很清楚。他回忆当时的情况说：“当县里得到上级撤销区级建制的指示后，有些党和行政领导人员并没有很好考虑事前应该做好那些准备工作，事后可能发生什么问题，应该怎样解决等，只是简单地根据上级的指示，发出一个撤销区级建制的通知，就算把事情办妥了。因为这个原故，撤销区级建制以后，财经部门发生了一些问题。问题还不止这些，广大乡村干部和群众都觉得撤销了区级建制很不方便，经常老远地从乡里来到县人民委员会要求解决问题，不是找不到人，就是没有人管。”
    几天后，当我要离开樊口镇的时候，这里出现了由县委和县人民委员会派来的财经指导小组，他们的任务是加强对区财经部门的政策领导和代表县人民委员会处理乡间群众提出的问题。这种直接深入下层解决问题是很好的，我们希望能够坚持下去，但是，采取什么样的工作方法和组织形式才能更加适应区级建制撤销以后的实际需要呢？这还有待于各地党组织在今后的实际工作中加以解决。
