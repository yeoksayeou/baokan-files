Xinhua News Agency, July 12th—U.S. Secretary of State Dulles, who claims to have expressed his views on neutralism perhaps fifty times, once again attacked neutralism at a press conference on July 11th and, under questioning from reporters, displayed obvious confusion and a dilemma.

Dulles said he believed that what he had said in the past about neutralism being immoral was still his view. He said, "I believe that neutralism that believes security is best found in isolation and indifference to others is immoral."

A reporter asked Dulles how this kind of neutralism manifests itself internationally. He said that first of all, it is manifested through membership in the United Nations. According to him, participating in the United Nations and abiding by the constraints of the UN Charter shows concern for others.

Another reporter pointed out that, according to Dulles' statement, there are actually no neutral countries in the world, because almost all countries that can join the United Nations have already joined. Dulles said, however, there is one exception, which is Switzerland, which has not joined the United Nations. He said he was unwilling to say that Switzerland's neutrality was immoral, and he indicated that Switzerland could be regarded as what he called a "very exceptional case."

The reporter further pointed out that, according to this statement, there are very few countries whose policy of neutrality can be regarded as immoral. Dulles said he thought there were very few. However, he immediately said that he "believes that some countries that condemn genuine collective security treaties are seeking to promote a somewhat erroneous view of neutrality."

A reporter asked Dulles which Asian countries could be classified as belonging to the type of country that Nixon referred to in Manila as "neutrality that does not make moral distinctions between right and wrong." Dulles replied, "I don't want to name countries. I think it's better if I don't."

Someone pointed out that the recent political developments in West Germany and Japan have affected the issue of rearmament in these countries, and asked Dulles to express his opinion. In his reply, Dulles emphasized that, as members of military alliances, these countries "have an obligation to share part of the burden of rearmament." At the same time, Dulles had to admit that the results of the Japanese elections reflect the widespread belief throughout the world that the danger of war is decreasing, and people are unwilling to bear the heavy burden of expanding armaments.

    杜勒斯第五十一次咒骂中立主义
    口出恶言攻击反对军事集团的国家
    据新华社12日讯　自称对中立主义可能已经表达过五十次意见的美国国务卿杜勒斯，七月十一日在记者招待会上又一次攻击中立主义，并且在记者们的追问下表现了明显的混乱和进退两难。
    杜勒斯说，他相信他过去所说的中立主义是不道德的话，而且仍然坚持这种看法。他说：“认为从孤立和对别人漠不关心当中最能找到安全的那种中立主义，我认为是不道德的。”
    有记者问杜勒斯，他所说的这种中立主义在国际方面怎样表现出来。他说，首先是通过联合国会员籍表现出来。照他说，参加联合国和遵守联合国宪章的约束就表示出了对别人的关心。
    有记者又指出，根据杜勒斯这种说法，实际上世界上就没有什么中立国家了，因为差不多所有能够加入联合国的国家都已经加入了联合国。杜勒斯说，可是，有一个例外，就是瑞士，它没有参加联合国。他说，他不愿意说瑞士的中立是不道德的，他表示瑞士可以算作他所说的“非常例外的情况”。
    记者进一步指出，照这样说法，就很少有哪些国家的中立政策可以认为是不道德的了。杜勒斯说，他想是极少的。可是，他马上又说，他“相信有些谴责真正的集体安全条约的国家正在寻求促进一种多少是错误的中立观点”。
    有记者追问杜勒斯，亚洲国家中哪一些可以归入属于尼克松在马尼拉谈到的所谓“在是非之间不加以道义上的识别的中立”的这一类国家。杜勒斯回答说：“我不想提出国家的名字来。我想我还是不提的好些。”
    有人指出西德和日本最近政局的发展已经影响到这些国家的重新武装问题，并且请杜勒斯发表意见。杜勒斯在回答中强调说，作为军事联盟的成员，这些国家“有义务分担重新武装的一部分负担”。杜勒斯同时不得不承认，日本选举的结果反映出全世界各地普遍认为，战争的危险正在减少，人们不愿意承受扩充军备的沉重负担。
