The representatives criticized the provincial committee's work report for insufficient self-criticism and the lack of bottom-up criticism at the congress. The presidium accepted this criticism and improved its leadership of the congress. Based on the opinions discussed by the representatives, the presidium replaced individual provincial committee members and candidates for the Eighth National Congress who were not trusted by the people.

(Our Correspondent in Hefei, 16th) The first Congress of the Communist Party of China in Anhui Province was held in Hefei from July 2nd to 15th.

Zeng Xisheng, Secretary of the Anhui Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, said in his seven-year work report to the congress on behalf of the previous provincial committee that Anhui Province had suffered severe natural disasters in five of the seven years since liberation. However, in 1955, the province's grain output had already increased to more than double that of 1949. The total value of industrial output in 1955 increased fourfold compared to 1950. At present, Anhui has basically achieved full socialist agricultural collectivization; handicrafts, fisheries, shipping and other industries have also been basically collectivized; and capitalist industry and commerce have also basically undergone socialist transformation. Small merchants and peddlers have been incorporated into the orbit of the national planned economy. Zeng Xisheng said that the characteristic of Anhui's work is that social reform work and the tenacious struggle against natural disasters proceed simultaneously, but thanks to the correct leadership of the Party, these two tasks do not affect each other, but develop in a mutually reinforcing manner, enabling Anhui to advance in step with the whole country even under the pressure of years of disasters. Subsequently, Zeng Xisheng criticized some shortcomings and errors in his report, and at the same time pointed out the tasks of the Party's work in the future.

The representatives discussed the work report of the previous provincial committee in groups, believing that the provincial committee had correctly implemented the central government's principles and policies over the past few years and completed the various tasks stipulated by the central government; and they believed that the three reforms of agricultural production proposed by the provincial committee were of great benefit to avoiding disasters and ensuring harvests. At the same time, the representatives raised opinions on the provincial committee's setting of excessively rigid tasks and excessive demands in some areas in its leadership of agricultural production and grain purchases, believing that this was one of the reasons for the occurrence of coercive orders in some areas, and that the enthusiasm of local work could not be fully utilized. Some representatives also raised opinions on the current phenomenon of the Party and government not being separated in their work, and demanded improvement. Many other opinions were also raised at the group meetings regarding the provincial committee.

During the congress, the congress presidium took the initiative to solicit opinions from the representatives on the meeting. Some believed that although the provincial committee's work report mentioned general shortcomings and errors in its work, its self-criticism was insufficient; certain responsible persons of provincial-level organs criticized their subordinates more in their speeches, but lacked a spirit of self-criticism, and many representatives criticized the phenomenon of too little bottom-up criticism in the speeches at the congress. The congress presidium listened to everyone's opinions and further improved its leadership of the congress. After carefully studying the candidates for members of the Anhui Provincial Committee and representatives to the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China, the presidium submitted them to the representatives for discussion. At this time, the representatives conducted a serious review of all the candidates, criticized the ideological style and work attitude of certain candidates, and immediately demanded the replacement of certain members and representatives to the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China. The presidium promptly adopted everyone's opinions, replacing one inappropriately proposed candidate and one candidate with serious shortcomings in ideological style, and adjusted six candidates for representatives to the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China. The presidium also provided factual explanations to the representatives regarding the questions they raised. Then, the representatives elected new provincial committee members and representatives to the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China.

At the congress, the representatives studied Chairman Mao's instructions on mobilizing all positive factors to serve socialism and discussed the new Party Constitution (revised draft); finally, after adding opinions, they adopted a resolution agreeing to the work report of the previous provincial committee and adopted the 1956-1967 Anhui Province Agricultural Development Program (draft).

    安徽省召开第一次党代表大会
    代表们对省委工作报告中自我批评差和大会上自下而上的批评少提出了批评，主席团接受这一批评，改进了对大会的领导。主席团根据代表们讨论的意见，调换了个别不孚众望的省委委员和八大代表的候选人。
    本报合肥16日电　中共安徽省第一次代表大会，七月二日到十五日在合肥举行。
    中共安徽省委书记曾希圣代表上届省委向大会所作的七年工作报告中说，安徽省解放七年来，有五年都遭受了严重自然灾害。但是1955年全省粮食产量，却已经提高到1949年的一倍以上。工业总产值，1955年比1950年增加达四倍。现在，安徽已基本实现了全社会主义的农业合作化；手工业、渔业、船业等也都已基本合作化；资本主义工商业也已经基本上实行了社会主义改造。小商小贩都纳入了国家计划经济的轨道。曾希圣说，安徽工作的特点是，社会改革工作和对自然灾害的顽强斗争同时并行，但由于党的正确领导，这两项任务不是互相影响，而是相辅相成地发展，使安徽虽在连年遭灾的压力下，仍能和全国步调一致地前进。接着，曾希圣在报告中，对一些工作中的缺点和错误进行了批评，同时指出了今后党的工作任务。
    代表们分小组讨论了上届省委的工作报告，认为几年来省委正确执行了中央的方针政策，完成了中央所规定的各项任务；并认为省委提出的农业生产三项改革，对避灾保收有很大作用。同时，代表们对省委在领导农业生产和购粮等工作中，对某些地区规定任务太死、要求过大提出了意见，认为这是促使某些地区发生强迫命令的原因之一，对地方工作的积极性也不能充分发挥。有的代表对目前工作中党政不分的现象也提出意见，要求改进。小组会上还对省委提了不少其他意见。
    大会举行期间，大会主席团向代表们主动征求了对会议的意见。有的认为，省委工作报告虽然谈到了对工作中的一般缺点和错误，但自我批评不够；某些省级机关的负责人在自己的发言中对下边批评多，而缺乏自我批评的精神，有不少代表并对大会发言中自下而上的批评少的现象，提出了批评。大会主席团听取了大家的意见，进一步改进了对大会的领导。主席团对安徽省委委员及出席中共第八次全国代表大会的代表候选人仔细研究后，即提交代表们讨论。这时，代表们对所有候选人进行了认真的审查，对某些候选人的思想作风、工作态度提出批评，并当即要求调换某些委员和出席中共第八次全国代表大会的代表候选人。主席团及时采纳了大家的意见，更换了一个提得不适当的候选人，和一个思想作风上有严重缺点的候选人，调整了六个出席中共第八次全国代表大会的代表候选人。主席团对代表们提出的疑问，也据实向代表们作了解释。然后，代表们选举了新的省委委员，和出席中共第八次全国代表大会的代表。
    大会上，代表们学习了毛主席关于调动一切积极因素为社会主义服务的指示，讨论了新党章（修改稿）；最后，经过补充意见后，通过决议，同意上届省委的工作报告，并通过了1956——1967年安徽省农业发展纲要（草案）。
