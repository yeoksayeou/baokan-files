    Jiaotong University to Begin Relocating to Xi'an in Mid-July

    (Our report) The faculty of the first and second year classes of Jiaotong University will begin relocating to the emerging industrial city of Xi'an in mid-July.

    For the teachers, this may seem like moving house, but it is actually a pleasant journey. The university has booked comfortable sleeping berths on the train for them, and the university will send dedicated personnel to transport all luggage and household items, so teachers don't have to worry about anything themselves. They only need to pack their luggage and leave it in the dormitory before departure, and after arriving in Xi'an, they can collect all their belongings in their new home.

    Associate Professor Xu Guifang and his wife, mother, and five children have already received their moving expenses. In their new home in Xi'an, the university will provide furniture such as beds, chairs, tables, and bookcases. He has already begun to consider the teaching tasks for the teaching and research group and the night university in the next semester.

    According to logistics personnel who recently arrived from the new campus in Xi'an, the top floor of the classroom building, which can accommodate more than 4,000 students, has already been completed, and the ground floor has begun to be plastered. Three of the four teachers' dormitory buildings have been completed. Here, each family will have about five rooms, including bedrooms, living rooms, kitchens, and bathrooms. Department stores, general merchandise stores, vegetable markets, silk and cloth shops, barbershops, etc., in the teacher residential area have also begun construction and strive to be completed by the end of July.

    At the same time, first-year students of Jiaotong University will also relocate to Xi'an with the teachers.

    交通大学七月中旬开始迁往西安
    本报讯　交通大学一、二年级的教师们，将在七月中旬开始迁往新兴工业城市西安。
    看看教师们好像在搬家，实际上却是一次愉快的旅行。学校已经为他们定了舒适的火车卧铺，全部行李和家用杂物也由学校派专人运送，教师们一切不必自己费心。他们只要在出发前把行李打好包放在宿舍里，到达西安后就可以在新居领到自己所有的东西。
    徐桂芳副教授和他的妻子、母亲和五个孩子都已经领到了搬家费。在西安的新居里，将有学校供给的床、椅、桌、书橱等用具。现在，他已经开始考虑下学期教研组和夜大学的教课任务了。
    据最近从西安新校址来的总务人员说，那边可容纳四千多学生上课的教室大楼的最高一层已经砌好，底层也开始粉刷了。教师们的四幢宿舍已经建好了三幢。在这里，每家约有卧室、起居室、厨房、盥洗室等五个房间。教师住宅区的百货公司、南北杂货店、小菜场、绸布店、理发店等也已经开始建造，争取在七月底完工。
    同时交通大学一年级学生也将同教师们一起迁往西安。
