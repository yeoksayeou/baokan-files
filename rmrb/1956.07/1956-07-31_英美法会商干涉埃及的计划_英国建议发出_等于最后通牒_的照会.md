Xinhua News Agency, London, 30th - British Foreign Secretary Lloyd, French Foreign Minister Pineau, and U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Murphy held a five-hour meeting in London on the evening of July 29 to discuss how to deal with Egypt's nationalization of the Suez Canal. The official statement issued after the meeting emphasized the "seriousness of the situation" and stressed that the West must "retain the right to use the canal as an international waterway," even though the Egyptian government has repeatedly stated that it will guarantee freedom of navigation.

According to Western news agencies, the theme of this emergency meeting was to formulate a plan to take interventionist action against Egypt.

Sources revealed that Lloyd and Pineau spoke with intense attitudes during the meeting about Egypt's reclamation of the Suez Canal. According to the Associated Press, Britain suggested that, as a first step, the West should send a note to the Egyptian government "equaling an ultimatum." This note would warn that Egypt "would risk facing Western military force."

United Press reported that France also advocated "taking direct military action when necessary."

According to Agence France-Presse, Murphy, after speaking with Washington by telephone, has "agreed to study in more detail the proposals put forward by the French and British representatives."

The representatives of Britain, France, and the United States also made a comprehensive consideration of the future of Western policy in the Middle East.

    英国建议发出“等于最后通牒”的照会
    据新华社30日讯　伦敦消息：英国外交大臣劳埃德、法国外交部长比诺和美国副国务卿帮办墨菲七月二十九日晚上在伦敦举行了五个钟头的会谈，讨论如何对付埃及把苏彝士运河收归国有的问题。会谈后发表的官方声明强调“形势严重”，而且强调西方要“保留把这条运河当作国际水道利用的权利”，虽然埃及政府已经一再表示要保证运河的自由通航。
    据西方通讯社透露，这次紧急会谈的主题是拟订对埃及采取干涉行动的计划。
    消息透露，劳埃德和比诺在会谈中一致以激烈的态度谈到埃及收回苏彝士运河问题。据美联社说，英国建议，作为第一步，西方应当向埃及政府送出“等于最后通牒的照会”。这个照会将警告说，埃及“将有碰到西方武力的危险”。
    合众社消息说，法国也主张“在必要时采取直接军事行动”。
    据法新社说，墨菲在和华盛顿通过电话后，已经“同意要较为详细地研究法国和英国代表们提出的建议”。
    英、法、美三国的代表们还对西方的中东政策前途作了通盘的考虑。
