Answers to Readers' Questions

    Some readers have written to inquire about the national institutions and economic structure of Yugoslavia. We will now provide brief answers as follows:

    Q: Why is Yugoslavia called the Federal People's Republic?
    A: The Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia is a federal state composed of six republics. These six republics are: the People's Republic of Serbia, the People's Republic of Croatia, the People's Republic of Slovenia, the People's Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the People's Republic of Macedonia, and the People's Republic of Montenegro. In addition, there are two autonomous units, namely the Autonomous Province of Vojvodina and the Autonomous Region of Kosovo-Metohija, both within the People's Republic of Serbia. The inhabitants of the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia are mainly Serbs, Croats, Slovenes, Macedonians, and Montenegrins. Minorities include Hungarians, Turks, Italians, etc.

    Q: What are the main federal state institutions of Yugoslavia?
    A: The main federal state institutions of Yugoslavia are the Federal People's Assembly, the President of the Republic, the Federal Executive Council, and the Federal Administrative Organs.

    The Federal People's Assembly is the highest organ of power in Yugoslavia. It stipulates the general guiding principles for the work of state organs, especially administrative organs, determines the basic lines of domestic and foreign policy, decides on issues of war and peace, approves the most important international treaties, issues amnesties, and appoints and removes the highest leading personnel of state organs, etc.

    The Federal People's Assembly is composed of two chambers: the Federal Chamber and the Chamber of Producers.

    The Federal Chamber is the main chamber, and it is a general representative body representing all citizens of Yugoslavia with equal rights, representing the entire Yugoslavia as a federal state, and the republics as member states of the federation. The majority of the Federal Chamber representatives are elected by all citizens on the basis of universal, equal, direct, and secret suffrage. One Federal Chamber representative is elected for every 60,000 voters. Another portion of representatives is elected by the national assemblies of each republic as representatives of that republic in the Federal People's Assembly. This part of the delegation comprises sixty members, (each republic – regardless of size – elects ten members, the Autonomous Province of Vojvodina elects six members, and the Autonomous Region of Kosovo-Metohija elects four members). In the Federal Chamber, in addition to working like other representatives, they can form the Chamber of Nationalities under limited circumstances. The Chamber of Nationalities only considers issues from the principle of complete equality among the republics and autonomous units. In this way, the special interests of each republic and autonomous region can be reflected in the Federal People's Assembly.

    The Chamber of Producers of the Federal Assembly is composed of producers, i.e., those directly engaged in material production. The Chamber of Producers' representatives are not directly elected by the producers, but indirectly elected by the members of the producer councils of cities or districts. Another characteristic of the election of representatives to the Chamber of Producers is that they are not elected according to population proportions but according to the contribution of producers in each economic sector to production. That is to say, the greater the value produced, the more representatives should be elected, otherwise, the fewer. Therefore, although the agricultural population in Yugoslavia is larger than the industrial population, the number of agricultural producer representatives is much smaller than that of industrial producer representatives.

    The scope of powers of the Chamber of Producers is much smaller than that of the Federal Chamber. The Chamber of Producers only participates in decisions directly or indirectly related to the economy, and its representatives do not participate in voting on bills concerning national defense, national security, civil rights, etc. However, the representatives of the Chamber of Producers have the right to propose amendments to laws approved separately by the Federal Chamber and also have the right to propose amendments to existing laws already enacted separately by the Federal Chamber.

    Issues decided with equal rights by both chambers include amending the constitution, formulating economic plans, national budgets, and other economic bills or resolutions, deciding on the dissolution of parliament, and so on. The election of the President of the Republic, the Chairman of the Federal Executive Council, the Speaker of the Parliament, and other matters are also decided at joint meetings of representatives of the two chambers.

    The Federal People's Assembly of Yugoslavia has a Presidium. The main functions belonging to the Presidium have been transferred to the President of the Republic. The President of the Republic is the head of state. He represents the country externally and commands the national armed forces. He possesses other general powers as head of state. The President concurrently serves as the Chairman of the Federal Executive Council and the Chairman of the Defense Council.

    The President of the Republic is elected by the Federal People's Assembly at the first joint meeting of the two chambers after the general election. The presidential candidate must be a member of parliament and must be elected by an absolute majority. The President is accountable to the parliament in his work. The parliament can remove the President at any time.

    The Federal Executive Council is the main executive organ of the Federal People's Assembly, but it is not exactly the same as the cabinet or council of ministers in some countries. It only determines the general political direction of the administrative organs in accordance with the law and other regulations of the parliament, and conducts the highest supervision over the implementation of these policies. The Federal Executive Council is not responsible for handling regular state administrative work.

    The Federal Executive Council is elected by the Federal People's Assembly from among the representatives of the Federal Chamber, with at least fifteen members. The chairmen of the executive councils of each republic should be ex officio members of the Federal Executive Council. The Federal Executive Council is responsible to the Federal People's Assembly, which has the power to remove its members.

    The regular administrative tasks of the state administrative organs are the responsibility of specially established federal administrative organs. They include five state secretariats, a foreign trade commission, and many other administrative bodies. The five state secretariats are: the Secretariat of National Defense, the Secretariat of Foreign Affairs, and the Secretariat of Internal Affairs. These secretariats are led by state secretaries, of which the Secretary of National Defense and the Secretary of Foreign Affairs must be members of the Federal Executive Council. The secretaries do not form a cabinet-like meeting, but are independent of each other and directly subordinate to the Federal Executive Council.

    Q: What is the socio-economic basis of Yugoslavia?
    A: The socio-economic basis of Yugoslavia is the social ownership of the means of production. Article 16 of the Constitution of the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia stipulates: "National ownership is the main pillar of the country's economic development. National ownership is under the special protection of the state." In 1945, Yugoslavia implemented land system reform, abolishing landlord ownership. In 1946, industrial nationalization was implemented, placing raw materials and power resources, large and medium-sized industries, transportation, means of transportation, banks, and credit institutions under state ownership. All wholesale trade and the vast majority of retail trade are operated by the state. However, in the vast majority of agriculture and handicrafts, private ownership of the means of production is still maintained today.

    The main classes in Yugoslavia are the working class and the laboring farmers. They hold the political power of the country. The social ownership of the means of production and the fact that the working class and laboring people hold state power determine the socialist nature of Yugoslavia's state and social system.

    Q: What are the main political parties and socio-political organizations in Yugoslavia?
    A: Yugoslavia now has only one political party, the League of Communists of Yugoslavia. Its predecessor was the Communist Party of Yugoslavia, which was renamed to its current name in November 1952. According to the provisions of the League Charter, "The League of Communists of Yugoslavia is the organized political force of the working class of the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia..." It "in its activities, follows the theory of scientific socialism...". In May 1955, President Tito pointed out in a speech to the officers and soldiers of the First Proletarian Division: "...The role of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, the role of communists, will be of decisive significance for the further development, progress, and prosperity of our country at present and for a long period to come. Communists, members of the League of Communists, should not be assimilated among the masses, but should influence others, should be the embodiment of socialist consciousness, and should be the best essence and most active backbone produced by the Marxist-Leninist science... The communists themselves should have the lofty goal of building socialism." At the end of 1955, the League of Communists of Yugoslavia had more than 624,000 members.

    The Socialist Alliance of Working People of Yugoslavia, formerly known as the People's Front, is an organization of working people (including trade unions, youth, women, and other labor groups) with the League of Communists as its core, striving to build a socialist society in Yugoslavia.

    The Federation of Trade Unions of Yugoslavia is a free, voluntary, and democratic organization of the Yugoslav working class, with nearly 1.65 million members. The People's Youth League of Yugoslavia is a political and educational organization of Yugoslav youth, with 1.17 million members. The Federation of Women's Associations of Yugoslavia is a huge mass organization of Yugoslav women, which, as a member organization of the Socialist Alliance of Working People of Yugoslavia, politically educates women and resolves many specific issues related to the status of women, with approximately four million members.

    关于南斯拉夫的国家机构等问题
    有些读者来信询问关于南斯拉夫的国家机构和经济结构的情况，我们现在一并分别简复如下：
    问：南斯拉夫为什么称为联邦人民共和国？
    答：南斯拉夫联邦人民共和国是由六个共和国组成的联邦国家。这六个共和国是：塞尔维亚人民共和国、克罗地亚人民共和国、斯洛文尼亚人民共和国、波斯尼亚—黑塞哥维那人民共和国、马其顿人民共和国和门的内哥罗人民共和国。此外，有两个自治单位，即伏伊伏丁那自治省和戈索伏—密托希亚自治区，都在塞尔维亚人民共和国境内。南斯拉夫联邦人民共和国的居民主要是塞尔维亚人，克罗地亚人，斯洛文尼亚人，马其顿人，门的内哥罗人。少数民族有：匈牙利人，土耳其人，意大利人等。
    问：南斯拉夫有那些主要的联邦国家机构？
    答：南斯拉夫主要的联邦国家机构有联邦国民议会、共和国总统和联邦执行委员会，以及联邦行政机关。
    联邦国民议会是南斯拉夫的最高权力机关。它规定国家机关、特别是行政机关工作的一般指导原则，决定对内对外政策的基本路线，决定战争与和平的问题，批准最重要的国际条约，颁布大赦，任免国家机关的最高领导人员等。
    联邦国民议会由联邦院和生产者院两院组成。
    联邦院是主要的议院，它是一般的代表机关，代表所有具有平等权利的南斯拉夫公民，代表作为联邦国家的整个南斯拉夫和作为联邦成员国的各人民共和国。联邦院的大多数代表由全体公民在普遍、平等、直接、秘密投票选举的基础上选出。每六万个选民推选一名联邦院代表，另一部分代表由各人民共和国的国民议会选出，作为各该共和国在联邦国民议会的代表。这部分代表共六十名，（每一个人民共和国——不论大小——都选举十名，伏伊伏丁那自治省选举六名，戈索伏—密托希亚自治区选举四名）。他们在联邦院除与其他代表同样地工作外，在限定的一些情况下可组成民族院。民族院仅从各人民共和国、自治单位完全平等的原则考虑问题。这样，每一个共和国和自治地区的特殊利益都能在联邦国民议会中得到反映。
    联邦议会的生产者院，是由生产者即直接从事物质生产的人组成的。生产者院代表不由生产者中间直接选出，而由市或区的生产者参议会的议员中间接选出。生产者院代表选举的另一个特点是，他们并不按照人数比例而是按照各经济部门的生产者在生产中所作的贡献多少来选举的。也就是说，所生产的价值大，应选的代表就多，否则就少。因此，虽然南斯拉夫的农业人口比工业人口要多，但是农业生产者代表的人数却比工业生产者代表少得多。
    生产者院比联邦院职权范围要小得多。生产者院只参与和经济直接或间接有关的决定，它的代表不参加关于国防、国家安全、公民权等议案的表决。但是生产者院的代表对联邦院单独批准的法律有提出修改的权利，对联邦院已经单独制定的已施行的法律也有提出修改意见的权利。
    两院有平等权利决定的问题包括修改宪法，制定经济计划、国家预算和其他有关经济的法案或决议，决定议会的解散，等等。选举共和国总统、联邦执行委员会主席、议会议长等问题，也在两院代表联席会议上决定。
    南斯拉夫联邦国民议会设有主席团。属于主席团的主要职能都转属共和国总统。共和国总统是国家元首。他对外代表国家并统率全国武装部队。他拥有作为国家元首的其他一般职权。总统兼任联邦执行委员会主席并担任国防委员会主席。
    共和国总统由联邦国民议会在大选后首次两院联席会议上选出。总统候选人必须是议会成员，并必须以绝对多数票才能当选。总统在工作上对议会负责。议会可以随时罢免总统。
    联邦执行委员会是联邦人民议会的主要执行机关，但它和某些国家的内阁政府或部长会议并不完全相同。它只根据法律和议会的其他规定决定行政机关的一般政治方针，并对这些政策的执行进行最高的监督。联邦执行委员会并不负责处理经常的国家行政工作。
    联邦执行委员会由联邦国民议会从联邦院的代表中选举产生，至少有十五名委员。各人民共和国执行委员会主席应为联邦执行委员会的当然委员。联邦执行委员会对联邦国民议会负责，后者有权罢免其委员。
    国家行政机关经常性的行政任务由特设的联邦行政机关负责执行。它们包括五个国务秘书处，一个对外贸易委员会和其他许多行政机构。五个国务秘书处是：国防秘书处、外交秘书处、内务秘书处。这些秘书处分别由国务秘书长领导，其中国防秘书长和外交秘书长必须由联邦执行委员会委员充任。各秘书长并不组成像内阁一类的会议，而是各自独立，直接隶属于联邦执行委员会。
    问：南斯拉夫的社会经济基础如何？
    答：南斯拉夫的社会经济基础是生产资料的社会所有制。南斯拉夫联邦人民共和国宪法第十六条规定：“全民所有制是国家发展国民经济的主要支柱。全民所有制受国家的特别保护。”1945年，南斯拉夫实行了土地制度改革，废除了地主所有制。1946年，又实行了工业国有化，把原料和动力资源、大型和中型工业、运输业、交通工具、银行和信贷机关收归国有，全部批发商业和极大部分零售商业都由国家经营。但是，在绝大部分农业和手工业中，今天还保持着生产资料的私有制。
    南斯拉夫国内的主要阶级是工人阶级和劳动农民。它们掌握着国家的政权。生产资料的社会所有制和工农劳动人民掌握政权的事实，决定了南斯拉夫的国家和社会制度的社会主义性质。
    问：南斯拉夫有哪些主要的政党和社会政治团体？
    答：南斯拉夫现在只有一个政党，就是南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟。它的前身是南斯拉夫共产党，是在1952年11月改为现在的名称的。根据盟章的规定，“南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟是南斯拉夫联邦人民共和国工人阶级的有组织的政治力量……”它“在自己的活动中，遵循着科学社会主义的理论……”。1955年5月铁托总统在对第一无产者师团的官兵演说中，曾指出：“……南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟的作用，共产主义者的作用，在目前以及在今后的长时期内对于我们国家的进一步发展、进步和繁荣，将具有决定性的意义。共产主义者，共产主义者联盟盟员不应当在群众中被同化，而应当影响别人，应当是社会主义意识的体现者，应当是马克思—列宁主义科学所产生的最好的精华和最积极的中坚……共产主义者自己应当具有建成社会主义的崇高目的。”南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟在1955年底时共有盟员六十二万四千多人。
    南斯拉夫劳动人民社会主义联盟的前身是人民阵线，它是以共产主义者联盟为核心的劳动人民的组织（它包括工会、青年、妇女和其他劳动人民团体），在南斯拉夫为建设社会主义社会而奋斗。
    南斯拉夫工会联合会是南斯拉夫工人阶级的自由、自愿的和民主的组织，现有会员近一百六十五万人。南斯拉夫人民青年联盟是南斯拉夫青年的政治和教育组织，现有盟员一百一十七万人。南斯拉夫妇女会联合会是南斯拉夫妇女的巨大群众组织，它作为南斯拉夫劳动人民社会主义联盟的成员组织在政治上教育妇女，并解决许多与妇女地位有关的具体问题，现有成员约四百万。
