    Prepare Early for Establishing Advanced Agricultural Cooperatives
    Suining County, Sichuan Province, Widely Carries Out Propaganda on Expanding and Merging Cooperatives

    (Our dispatch) Recently, various townships in Suining County, Sichuan Province, successively convened a series of meetings involving Party and Youth League branches, cooperative cadres, youth, women, and individual farmers to universally carry out propaganda work on expanding and merging cooperatives, in order to prepare early for developing advanced agricultural production cooperatives. Currently, cooperative cadres and members are clamoring to merge into larger cooperatives, and many individual households are actively requesting to join cooperatives.

    As soon as the preparation work for expanding and merging cooperatives began, the township branches of the Chinese Communist Party in Suining County, while organizing and leading the masses in production, extensively and deeply publicized the superiority of advanced cooperatives and the conditions and long-term plans for establishing them. At the same time, they conducted education on the consistency of immediate interests with long-term interests, individual interests with collective interests, and local interests with national interests, addressing the concerns of the majority of farmers regarding expanding and merging cooperatives. In addition, propaganda was carried out based on the socialist principles of the strong helping the weak, the old helping the new, and the advanced helping the backward, overcoming the erroneous ideas of advanced cooperatives disliking backward cooperatives, paddy field cooperatives disliking upland field cooperatives, and some cadres fearing that they would not be able to become cooperative cadres after large cooperatives were established, or taking the opportunity to change shifts. The cooperative cadres have all expressed their willingness to lead and do a good job in production, and to carry out thorough and meticulous ideological mobilization work. At the branch meeting convened by the Buyun Township Branch of the Chinese Communist Party, seventy of the seventy-three Party members present actively and enthusiastically participated in reviewing the preliminary plan for expanding and merging cooperatives in the township and discussed how to publicize and implement the principles of voluntariness and mutual benefit. The Party members present also made assurances to the branch that they would not sell cattle, reduce pigs, cut down trees, divide up public accumulation, or waste fertilizer, and that they would actively do a good job in production.

    After the positive publicity of policies and discussion in various large and small meetings, the majority of farmers actively requested to expand and merge cooperatives. Of the 634 individual households in Yunfeng Township, 590 planned to join cooperatives. Among the 140 individual households in Villages One and Six of this township, 126 had already submitted the spring seeds to the cooperative.

    In the process of this expansion and merger propaganda, various localities also adopted the method of connecting acquaintances to acquaintances and individual visits, which proved to be very effective. For example, in Village One of Xinmin Township, five of the nineteen individual farmers originally did not want to join the cooperative because they were afraid of losing money on the valuation of their plowing cattle. After the cooperative director Wen Shumao visited and talked to them individually, explaining the policy of voluntariness and mutual benefit, they all expressed that they would definitely join the cooperative this time.

    及早作好办高级农业社的准备工作   
    四川遂宁县广泛开展扩社并社宣传
    本报讯　最近四川省遂宁县各乡先后召开了党团支部、社干部、青年、妇女、个体农户等一系列的会议，普遍开展扩社并社的宣传工作，为发展高级农业生产合作社及早作好准备。目前，社干部和社员都纷纷要求并大社，许多单干户积极要求入社。
    扩社、并社准备工作一开始，中共遂宁县各乡支部一边组织领导群众生产，一边就广泛深入地宣传高级社的优越性，办高级社的条件和远景规划。同时，针对广大农民对扩社、并社的思想顾虑，进行了眼前利益与长远利益、个人利益与集体利益、局部利益与国家利益一致性的教育。另外，还根据强帮弱、老帮新、先进帮落后的社会主义原则进行宣传，克服了先进社嫌落后社、坝地社嫌乡地社以及某些干部怕办了大社当不成社干部，或趁机会好换班的错误思想。社干部们纷纷表示要领导搞好生产，做好深入细致的思想发动工作。中共步云乡支部召开的支部大会上，到会的七十三个党员中有七十个党员积极热情地参加审查了全乡扩社并社的初步方案和讨论了如何宣传贯彻自愿互利原则。到会的党员，还向支部作了不卖牛、不减猪、不砍伐树木、不分掉公共积累、不浪费肥料、积极搞好生产的保证。
    通过各种大小会议正面宣传政策和座谈讨论后，广大农民都积极要求扩社、并社。云丰乡的634户个体农户中，有590户打算入社。这个乡的一、六两村的140户个体农户中，已经向合作社交齐小春种子的就有126户。
    在这次扩社、并社宣传的过程中，各地还采用了熟人连熟人、个别访问的串联办法，收效很大。如新民乡一村十九户个体农民中有五户原来怕耕牛折价吃亏而不愿入社，经过社长文书茂个别访问谈心，向他们交代了自愿互利政策以后，他们都表示这次一定入社。
