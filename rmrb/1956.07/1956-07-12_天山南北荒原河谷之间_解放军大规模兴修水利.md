Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi, 10th: The Production and Construction Corps of the Xinjiang Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, in the first half of this year, has been engaged in large-scale stone transport, sand removal, ditch digging, and dam construction in the wilderness and valleys north and south of the Tianshan Mountains, completing a total of twenty-seven water conservancy projects.

　　These projects are distributed in the river basins of the Manas River, Urumqi River, Kaidu River, Ili River, and others. They include large-scale water diversion canals such as Bayingou and irrigation canals for newly built farms such as Anjihai. The Liugou, Anjihai, and Kuitun reservoirs, located in the Manas River basin, after being completed in the next two years, can collectively divert and store more than 144 million cubic meters of local river floodwater. This will allow hundreds of thousands of mu of nearby cotton fields to obtain water during the annual dry season.

　　Seven projects have already been completed in the first half of this year. After the expansion of the Mengjin Reservoir in the Urumqi River basin, the water storage has increased from the past 3 million cubic meters to the current 60 million cubic meters, making it the largest reservoir in the Xinjiang region. It and the nearby Heping Canal regulate water volume for each other, irrigating more than 200,000 mu of land. The Aksu Victory Canal and the large canal on the west bank of the Manas River, and several other completed water diversion canals, can also enable local farms to increase production due to good irrigation.

　　The total amount of earth and stone excavated and filled for all the water conservancy projects constructed by the Production and Construction Corps in the first half of this year was more than 12 million cubic meters, and 365 permanent sluices and other structures were built. This year, a portion of mechanized equipment continued to be used for construction on large-scale water conservancy project sites. Due to improvements in design work, the unfolding of labor competitions, and increased use of local building materials, the cost of construction has been reduced.

    天山南北荒原河谷之间
    解放军大规模兴修水利
    新华社乌鲁木齐10日电　中国人民解放军新疆军区生产建设部队，今年上半年在天山南北的荒原河谷之间，大规模地运石搬沙、挖渠筑坝，共修建二十七项水利工程。
    这些工程分布在玛纳斯河、乌鲁木齐河、开都河、伊犁河等流域。它包括八音沟等大型引水渠和安集海等新建农场的灌溉渠道。分布在玛纳斯河流域的柳沟、安集海和奎屯三座水库，分别在今明两年完工后，共可引蓄当地河流洪水一亿四千多万立方公尺。将使附近几十万亩棉田在每年枯水期间获得用水。
    今年上半年已经有七项工程完工。乌鲁木齐河流域的猛进水库扩建完成后，蓄水由过去的三百万立方公尺增加到现在的六千万立方公尺，是新疆地区最大的水库，它和附近的和平渠互相调剂水量，灌溉二十多万亩土地。阿克苏胜利渠和玛纳斯河西岸大渠等已完成的几项引水渠道，也可使当地农场由于得到良好灌溉而增产。
    生产建设部队今年上半年修建的全部水利工程，共挖填土、石一千二百多万立方公尺，并且建设了永久性水闸等建筑物365座。今年在大型水利工程工地上继续采用了一部分机械化设备来施工。由于改进了设计工作，展开劳动竞赛和增加使用当地的建筑材料等，降低了工程造价。
