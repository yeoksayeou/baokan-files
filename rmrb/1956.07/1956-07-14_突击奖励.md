    "Rushing Rewards"
    Cao Lifu
    Comrade! Working in a factory, you probably haven't encountered a "rushing rewards" method, right?
    However, this method was "born" in the Datong Mining Bureau's No. 2 Mine.
    The No. 2 Mine failed to meet its production plan in January and February. Now, March is almost over, and each pit is losing more and more money on coal. What to do? The mine's leadership then stipulated that any shift that failed to complete its cycle task would not be allowed to go down the well. This way, they could avoid the responsibility of working overtime and wouldn't have to pay overtime wages. Unexpectedly, although this method was very good, the task still could not be completed. At this time, the head of the finance department gave the mine manager a brilliant plan—"rushing rewards." It stipulated: "Each well production team, from the date of the announcement of the rushing rewards method until the end of March, those who complete the production tasks evenly and exceeding the target will be awarded 500 yuan to the extraction shift and 500 yuan to the tunneling shift..."
    The news of the rushing rewards quickly spread to the workers, but the reaction was not good. Some said: This is clearly taking the country's money to make us rush to work overtime! Some said: If the leadership doesn't solve the specific problems, even if you take out 10 million yuan, you can only stare blankly. However, heavy rewards are sure to bring forth brave men. Since the reward method was promulgated, some people felt that as long as they worked a little harder, they could meet the leadership's requirements, so there was a phenomenon of rushing to work without regard to safety. As a result, there were five electrical and mechanical accidents, stopping production for nine and a half hours, and there were also two minor and one serious personal injury accidents. One chute operator, in order to load more coal, did not check whether the surroundings were safe and was injured in the waist by falling coal and stones, and was lying in the hospital from late March to mid-May. This is the consequence of "rushing rewards."
    However, the leaders of the No. 2 Mine did not accept these lessons, and still regarded it as a powerful trump card, and when the production task could not be completed, they would bring out this trump card of rushing rewards.
    The vast majority of workers are not interested in rushing rewards. They questioned the leadership why they were so enthusiastic about rewards, but did not solve specific problems? The workers in Meng Bingming's tunneling team all requested to participate in the "10,000-meter race" for tunneling 10,000 meters in a year initiated by Zhang Wanfu and others, but the production and geological work could not keep up, forcing them to stop work frequently. Just imagine, if the old tunnels are finished, and there is no place for them to continue tunneling, how can they complete the task? The working face is full of water, and the whole team has only three pairs of water shoes, and many people are working while soaking in the water. If these practical problems are not solved, but they want to complete the task "evenly and exceeding the target," one really doesn't know how these people are doing their calculations.

### “突击奖励”

    “突击奖励”
    曹力夫
    同志！你在工厂里工作，大概还没有见到过有一种“突击奖励”的办法吧。
    可是这种办法竟在大同矿务局二矿“诞生”了。
    二矿在一、二月份都没有完成生产计划。转眼三月份又快要过去了，各坑口的煤还是越亏越多。怎么办呢？矿的领导人员于是规定了每班完不成循环任务的，就不得上井。这样，既可以免除了担当加班加点的责任，又不用发加班费。不料，这个办法虽然很好，任务仍旧不能完成。这时，财务科长给矿长提了一条妙计——“突击奖励”。规定：“各井生产小组，自突击奖励办法公布之日起到三月底，凡是均衡地、超额地完成生产任务者，奖给回采大班五百元，奖给掘进五百元……”
    突击奖励的消息很快传达到工人中去了，反映却不妙。有的说：这明明是拿国家的钱要我们突击加班呢！有的说：领导上不解决具体问题，再拿一千万元也是干瞪眼。然而，重赏之下必有勇夫。自从奖励办法颁布后，有些人就觉着只要再努一把力，满可以达到领导要求，于是出现了突击干活，不顾安全的现象。结果机电事故出了五次，停止生产九时半，人身事故也发生了两件轻伤，一件重伤。有一个开溜子工，为了多装煤，不检查周围是否安全，被脱落下来的煤和石头打伤腰部，从三月下旬到五月中旬一直躺在医院里。这就是“突击奖励”的后果。
    可是，二矿的领导人员并不接受这些教训，依然把它当成一张得力王牌，在生产任务完不成的时候，就把突击奖励这张王牌端出来。
    绝大部分工人对突击奖励是不感兴趣的，他们责问领导上为什么热心于奖励，却不去解决具体问题？孟秉明掘进组的工人都要求参加张万福等人发起的一年掘进一万公尺的“万米竞赛”，但生产地质工作赶不上，使他们常常被迫停工。你想，旧的坑道掘进完了，没有地方让他们继续掘进，又怎能完成任务呢？工作面水大，全组只有三双水鞋，许多人在水里泡着干活。这些实际问题不解决，却想“均衡地、超额地”完成任务，这种人的如意算盘真不晓得是怎样打的。
