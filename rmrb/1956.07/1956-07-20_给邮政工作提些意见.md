    Suggestions for Postal Work
    Excessive Remittance Fees for Small Amounts

    I work in Shanghai and my family lives in Suzhou. Every month I have to send some money home. Previously, when joint state-private banks handled remittances, the handling fee was only 13 cents each time. But since 1953, when the postal service took over the remittance business, the postal fee has been 20 cents, plus a registration fee for sending the money order, so each remittance costs 40 cents. This is more than twice the original fee. If I remit 10 yuan at a time, the fee and registration fee account for 4% of the remittance amount. In my own case, a few months ago, my organization's salary was paid in two installments, so I had to remit money twice at the post office, and the monthly fees and registration fees accounted for 1.32% of my total salary income.

    It is said that the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications stipulates that the remittance fee is 20 cents for remittances under 300 yuan. I think this regulation is unreasonable. As far as I know, most remitters currently remit between 20-30 yuan to 50-60 yuan, and some even remit 5 yuan or 10 yuan. Why should their remittance fees be as high as those remitting 300 yuan? On what principle is this determined? Xu Yanwu

    Missing Remittance

    I was originally a soldier in the Tibet Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. In December 1953, I remitted 20 yuan to a comrade recuperating at the PLA Army Hospital in Qionglai County, Sichuan. The remittance was handled by the unit at the Changdu Post and Telecommunications Bureau. However, my comrade never received this remittance. Last April, I personally went to the Changdu Post and Telecommunications Bureau to inquire, and even paid an inquiry fee; but the whereabouts of the remittance are still unknown. After I was discharged and returned home, I wrote to the Changdu Post and Telecommunications Bureau three times in October of last year, March and May of this year to inquire, but have not received a reply to date. Does the post office intend to simply let this matter drop? Qian Zizhong

    "Unclaimed"

    On April 14th, our department ordered a batch of paintbrushes from the Shanghai Maoban Industrial Paintbrush Second Joint Association, specifying that the paintbrushes be sent directly to the Changle Post Office in Shandong, where our department's负责人 (fùzé rén - person in charge) would pick them up with a seal. From April 19th, our department repeatedly sent people to the Changle Post Office to pick up the goods, but the postal clerks always said that they had not arrived yet. We asked the post office to notify us when the goods arrived, but they refused. This dragged on until June, when our department became impatient and prepared to go to the Shanghai Post Office to investigate. The Changle Post Office then discovered that the batch of paintbrushes had actually arrived more than 40 days ago, and had been returned to the Shanghai Post Office on May 12th due to being "unclaimed." We were truly dumbfounded. The irresponsible attitude of the Changle Post Office made us very angry.

    News Becomes Old News

    The Xianyang Post Office in Shaanxi Province does not pay attention to the delivery of newspapers and periodicals, often delivering them only once every four or five days, turning news into old news. The newspapers ordered by our Beidu Township Party Branch were not delivered by the post office even once from June 21st to 25th, but on the 26th, they suddenly delivered 33 copies. The Xinhua Third Agricultural Cooperative ordered a copy of the Shaanxi Daily in May, but only received four issues by the end of the month. Someone composed a doggerel: "We don't see the newspaper for days, the post office sends a big pile at once, the news often becomes old news, it's better not to subscribe at all." It is hoped that the Xianyang Post Office will quickly improve the delivery of newspapers and periodicals.

    Airmail is Slower than Ordinary Mail

    On July 3rd, I received an airmail letter from Hanzhong City, Shaanxi Province. After opening it, I found that the letter was sent from the Hanzhong Post Office on June 22nd, and it took nearly two weeks to reach Changchun City, Jilin Province. If it were sent by ordinary mail, it would generally take only six days from Hanzhong to Changchun; sending it by plane actually took twice as long. What is the reason for this? Chang'an Resident

    Mail Piles Up for Twelve Days Unattended

    Li Fuye, a staff member of the Caiyuan Township Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Ji'an County, Jilin, went to Shenyang for medical treatment and forgot to bring his hospital admission certificate. He urgently wrote a registered letter asking his family to send it quickly. But after waiting and waiting, it never arrived. Old Master Li, who was accompanying him in Shenyang, became anxious and rushed home overnight, only to find that the family had not received the registered letter at all. Old Master Li called the Huadian Post Office, and the Huadian Post Office also said that they had not received it. Later, Old Master Li traveled more than 20 li to the post office and found the letter in a pile of messy papers. It turned out that the rural postman of the Huadian Post Office had gone to the county town for a meeting, and newspapers and letters had been piled up for a full twelve days, unattended.

    Of course, no one objects to the rural postman going to a meeting, but why should the letters be piled up? How many people's affairs will this delay? Comrade Li Fuye's registered letter was not delivered on time, which delayed his medical treatment. Yu Zhenhe, Fan Guangjin

    Why Aren't Commemorative Stamps Sold Individually?

    The service station of the Di'anmen Street Post Office in Beijing is promoting capital scenery stamps in our school. The pictures on these stamps are very beautiful, and the students like them very much. But when someone wanted to buy a single stamp, they were "politely refused" by the staff of the service station. It is said that the higher authorities stipulate that they must be sold as a set of three, the reason being that commemorative stamps are prepared for stamp collectors. If a single stamp is sold, the other two may not be sold. Under this restriction, many students simply did not buy them.

    Commemorative stamps are still stamps after all, why can't they be bought individually? Beijing Foreign Trade Institute

### 给邮政工作提些意见

    给邮政工作提些意见
    小额汇款汇费太高
    我在上海工作，家住苏州，每月都要寄一些钱回家。从前，公私合营银行办理汇款业务，每次只收一角三分手续费。但是1953年汇款业务改由邮局办理以后，邮局的汇费就是二角，外加寄汇票的挂号费，汇一次款就要四角钱。比原来的汇费高两倍多。如果一次汇款十元，汇费和挂号费就占汇款数的4％，以我自己来说，几个月前，我们机关的工资是分两次发的，我就要在邮局汇两次钱，每月汇费和挂号费就占我全部工资收入的1.32％。
    据说，邮电部规定汇额在三百元以下的，汇费一律是二角，我认为这个规定是不合理的，据我知道目前一般汇款人汇的钱大都是二、三十元到五、六十元，甚至还有汇五元、十元的。为什么他们的汇费也同汇三百元的人一样高呢？这是根据什么原则确定的？　许彦武
    下落不明的汇款
    我本来是中国人民解放军西藏军区的战士。1953年12月间，我汇二十元钱给一个在四川邛崃县陆军医院休养的战友，是由部队统一到昌都邮电局办理汇款手续的。可是我的战友一直没有收到这笔汇款。去年四月份，我亲自到昌都邮电局了解，还付了查询费；但是汇款下落仍旧不明。我复员回家后，又在去年十月、今年三月和五月先后三次写信向昌都邮电局查问，迄今也没有得到答复。邮局对这件事难道就这样不了了之吗？　钱子中
    “无人认领”
    我部于四月十四日向上海毛板工业毛刷第二联营所订购了一批毛刷，说明这批毛刷直接寄到山东昌乐邮局，由我部负责人持章领取。从四月十九日起，我部接连派人至昌乐邮局领货，邮局营业员总说还没有寄到。我们要求邮局在货到后通知我们一下，他们也不答应。一直拖到六月份，我部实在等得不耐烦，准备去上海邮局调查，昌乐邮局才查出这批毛刷原来已寄来四十多天，由于“无人认领”，已在五月十二日退回上海邮局。我们真是哭笑不得，昌乐邮局这种不负责任的态度真使我们气愤。

    新闻变成了旧闻
    陕西咸阳邮局不重视报刊的投递工作，往往四、五天才送一次报，使新闻变成了旧闻。我们北杜乡党支部订的报纸，从六月二十一日到二十五日，邮局连一张报纸也没有送来，可是在二十六日一下子就送来了三十三份。新华第三农业社在五月份订了一份陕西日报，到月底只收到四期。有人编了一首顺口溜：“我们几天不见报，邮局一送一大堆，新闻往往变旧闻，不如干脆不订报。”希望咸阳邮局迅速改善报刊投递工作。
                          王剑舟
    航空信比平信还慢
    七月三日，我接到一封由陕西省汉中市寄来的航空信，拆开看了以后，才发现这封信是在六月二十二日由汉中邮局发出，经过了将近两星期的时间才到达吉林省长春市。如果寄平信，从汉中到长春，一般也只要六天时间；用飞机送信反而拖长了一倍时间，这是什么缘故呢？　长安人
    邮件积压十二天没人管
    吉林辑安县财源乡供销社工作人员李富业去沈阳治病，忘了带入院证，急忙写挂号信要家里火速寄去。可是等了又等，总不见寄来。在沈阳陪伴他的李老大爷着急了，星夜赶到家里，谁知家里根本没有收到这封挂号信。李老大爷打电话问花甸邮局，花甸邮局也说没有收到。后来李老大爷跑了二十几里路赶到邮局，竟在乱纸堆中把这封信找出来了。原来花甸邮局的乡邮员到县城开会去了，报刊和信件整整积压了十二天，没有人管。
    乡邮员去开会，当然没人反对，但为什么要积压信件呢？这要耽误多少人的事情呵，李富业同志这封挂号信没有按时投递，就耽误了治病。　于振河、樊广金纪念邮票为何不售单张
    北京地安门大街邮局服务站在我们学校推销首都风景邮票。这种邮票画面很美，同学们都很喜爱。但是当有人想选购一张的时候，却遭到服务站工作同志的“婉言拒绝”。据说是上级规定必须三张一套一起出售，理由是纪念邮票是为集邮者准备的，如果单售一张，其余两张就可能卖不出去。在这个限制下，很多同学就干脆不买了。
    纪念邮票终归还是邮票，为什么不能单买呢？
