Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi, 14th. A large number of local ethnic minority cadres in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region have grown up, equivalent to eighteen times the number at the beginning of liberation in 1949. To date, 51,106 cadres of all ethnic groups hold positions in Party organizations, state organs, mass organizations, and industrial and mining enterprises at all levels in the Autonomous Region, accounting for 55.5% of the total number of cadres. Among them, 3,298 have assumed leadership positions at the level of district head and above.

Among the members of Party committees at all levels above the CPC District Committee, local ethnic minority party members have reached 40% to 50%. In government organs, twenty-two local ethnic minority cadres hold positions as commissioners, governors, and mayors. There are one hundred local ethnic minority county heads and deputy county heads in eighty counties throughout the Autonomous Region.

The Autonomous Region’s Party and government leaders attach great importance to the training and promotion of ethnic minority cadres. During the democratic reform movement and the socialist transformation movement, outstanding individuals who already possessed certain moral and talent conditions, could closely connect with the masses, and had potential for further development, were boldly and extensively promoted according to the principle of "promote them, continue to train and improve them." At the same time, various short-term training classes and primary Party schools and cadre schools were established to train local ethnic minority cadres.

    中共区委以上各级党委委员中，本地民族党员已达40％到50％。在政府机关中，有二十二名本地民族干部担任正副专员、州长、市长，全自治区八十个县有一百名本地民族正副县长。
    自治区党政领导很重视培养、提拔民族干部的工作，在民主改革运动和社会主义改造运动中，对那些已经具备了一定德才条件，能密切联系群众，并有培养前途的优秀分子，根据“提拔起来，继续培养提高”的原则，大胆、大量地提拔；同时开办了各种短期训练班和初级党校、干部学校，来培养本地民族干部。
