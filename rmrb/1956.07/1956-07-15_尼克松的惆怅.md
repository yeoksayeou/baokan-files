Nixon's Melancholy

Recently, Nixon said with considerable melancholy that the United States faces a "painful dilemma" in dealing with the Soviet Union's "peaceful actions." What is the reason? In his own words, it is "If we reject these actions, many countries will see us as warmongers; and if we accept them, we may weaken our alliance."

This passage is worth pondering. First, Nixon admitted that the Soviet Union is taking peaceful actions; the Soviet Union has consistently taken peaceful actions, which is the most obvious fact. However, some senior American officials, such as Dulles, have been constantly fabricating the "Soviet threat of aggression." The Vice President's words are a wonderful satire on these delirious ravings.

The United States has always tried to dress itself up as a gentle and honest "goddess of peace," and the executors of the "deterrence policy" have also memorized beautiful words like "peace." Nixon now admits that many countries "will see us as warmongers." But he is still not honest. The implication of this sentence seems to be: the United States will be seen as a warmonger—but is it now? It is impossible to get rid of the just judgment of the people of the world with a conjunction of "if...then." The blood of Korean children who died from American bombs has not yet dried, and the warships of the Stars and Stripes are still entrenched in Taiwan, China... If the United States really doesn't want to be a warmonger, it should quickly accept the peaceful actions of the Soviet Union and China. The United States can only gain people's understanding by taking positive and concrete measures to ease international tensions.

If the United States accepts the Soviet Union's peaceful actions, will it "weaken our alliance" as Nixon said? America's "friends" are no longer interested in and are increasingly dissatisfied with America's "Cold War" policy. If the United States insists on its own way, creates tension, and poisons the international atmosphere, then America's "friends" will not be as obedient as they used to be. British Prime Minister Eden expressed his desire to build a "bridge" between the United States and the Soviet Union. French Foreign Minister Pineau believes that France's main diplomatic efforts should be to strive to "eliminate the Cold War," and said that loyalty to the alliance should not be excessive. More and more countries have broken through the restrictions of the "embargo," and more and more countries are demanding that the United States withdraw its military bases from their territories... When America's "friends" feel that the Cold War should be eliminated, the United States is pulling them in the opposite direction. Can doing so "consolidate" the "alliance" between the United States and them?

So, what exactly is it that puts the United States in a "painful dilemma"? Nixon did not answer. Nixon is not yet frank, he still has "secret feelings" that have not been "expressed." Let us say it for him: "In the past, we rejected the Soviet Union's peaceful actions and created international tension, so we were called warmongers by the people of the world, and we suffered heavy failures. It seems that this policy is difficult to continue as before. However, if we accept the Soviet Union's peaceful actions, then the huge profits of our Wall Street will melt away with the ice of the Cold War. This is absolutely not allowed..." What to do? Nixon felt melancholy.

### 尼克松的惆怅

    尼克松的惆怅
    最近，尼克松带着颇为惆怅的心情说，美国在对待苏联的“和平行动”上面临着“痛苦的进退两难局面”。是什么原因呢？用他自己的话说是“如果拒绝这些行动，许多国家就会把我们看成是战争贩子；而如果加以接受，我们就可能削弱我们的联盟”。
    这段话是值得玩味的。首先，尼克松承认了苏联在采取和平行动；苏联一贯采取和平行动，这本来是最明显不过的事实。但是美国一些高级官员如杜勒斯之流却一直胡诌什么“苏联的侵略威胁”。副总统的话对于这些呓语是绝妙的讽刺。
    美国一直想把自己打扮成温柔敦厚的“和平女神”，“和平”之类漂亮的字眼也被“威慑政策”的执行者背得烂熟。尼克松现在却承认许多国家“会把我们看成是战争贩子”。可是他还不老实。这句话的言外之意似乎是：美国会被看作战争贩子，——而现在呢？还不是。用一个“如果……就会”的连词就想卸掉全世界人民的公正裁判是不可能的。死于美国炸弹的朝鲜孩子的鲜血还没有干，星条旗的军舰还盘踞在我国的台湾，……如果美国真的不想做战争贩子，就应该赶快接受苏联和我国的和平行动。美国只有采取积极的、具体的缓和国际紧张局势的措施，才能得到人们的谅解。
    如果美国接受苏联的和平行动，是否如尼克松说的“可能削弱我们的联盟”呢？美国的“朋友”们对于美国的“冷战”政策已经不感兴趣，并且日益不满了。如果美国一意孤行，制造紧张局势，毒化国际气氛，那么，美国的“朋友”们是不会像从前那样听话的。英国首相艾登表示要为美国苏联之间建造“桥梁”。法国外长比诺认为法国外交的主要努力应该争取“消除冷战”，并说对同盟的忠诚不应该带有过份的性质。愈来愈多的国家冲破了“禁运”的限制，愈来愈多的国家要求美国撤出在它们国土上的军事基地……当美国的“朋友”们感觉到应该消除冷战的时候，美国却拉着他们向相反的方向跑，这样做能“巩固”美国和他们的“联盟”吗？
    那末，究竟是什么使美国面临着“痛苦的进退两难局面”呢？尼克松没有回答。尼克松还不坦白，他尚有“衷肠”未“诉”。让我们来代他说一遍吧：“过去我们拒绝了苏联的和平行动，制造国际紧张局势，因此我们被全世界人民称为战争贩子，我们遭到惨重的失败。看来这个政策是很难照老样子执行下去了。可是，如果我们接受了苏联的和平行动，那么，我们华尔街的巨大利润将随冷战的冰块消融。这是万万要不得的……”怎么办呢？尼克松感到惆怅了。
