Xinhua News Agency, Bonn, 15th: Indian Prime Minister Nehru, who is currently visiting West Germany, criticized the United States in Bonn on July 14th for possessing a so-called "missionary spirit," which is fueling the division of the world into two opposing camps.

Nehru, in a speech to the West German Foreign Policy Association, said: "The United States wants others to follow its will. If others don't comply, they (the United States) feel unhappy and think that others' ideas are somewhat wrong. This idea leaves no room for any country to sit on the fence. If it is carried through to the end, it will divide the world into two hostile camps, each ready to strangle the other."

Nehru believes that the current East-West conflict should not be considered entirely from the perspective of communism and anti-communism. He said, "Many of our ideas are distorted by the concepts of communism and anti-communism. If Russia were as strong as it is today but not a communist country, there would undoubtedly be the same conflict."

Nehru said that the German problem is a major issue in the world today. There are only two ways to solve the German problem: either through "imposed overwhelming strength" or through peaceful negotiations. He said, "If we declare war illegal, the only other solution is negotiation. However, in this case, a peaceful atmosphere must be created."

Nehru held a press conference at the Bonn government press office on the same day. At the press conference, he refuted Dulles's statement insulting neutralism as "immoral." Nehru said that the recent debate on whether neutrality is "moral" or "immoral" is a manifestation of warmongering. He went on to say that unless it is during a war, he cannot think of neutrality. He also said that today it is important for politicians to avoid gambling with war to solve international problems. Any war, any preparation for war, and all the consequences of war are immoral.

When talking about the Algerian issue, Nehru said that India would not refuse a request to help seek a solution to the Algerian problem.

    尼赫鲁再斥冷战政策
    谴责美国一定要别人服从它的意志
    驳斥杜勒斯对中立主义的恶意侮辱
    新华社15日讯　波恩消息：正在西德访问的印度总理尼赫鲁七月十四日在波恩指责美国具有一种他所谓的“传教士精神”，这种精神正在助长把世界分裂为两个敌对阵营。
    尼赫鲁向西德的外交政策协会发表演讲说：“美国希望别人遵从它的意志。如果别人不照办的话，他们（美国）就感到不愉快并且认为别人的想法有些不对头。这种想法不给任何国家留下持骑墙态度的余地。如果把它贯彻到底，它将把世界分裂为两个敌对的阵营，每一方都准备扼住另一方的咽喉。”
    尼赫鲁认为，不要完全从共产主义和反共产主义的观点出发来考虑目前的东西方冲突。他说，“我们有许多想法都被共产主义和反共产主义的概念歪曲了。如果俄国像它今天那样强大而又不是一个共产主义国家的话，毫无疑问，也会存在着同样的冲突。”
    尼赫鲁说，德国问题是今天世界上的一个重大问题。解决德国问题只有两个办法，或者是通过“强加的压倒优势的实力”，或者是通过和平谈判。他说，“如果我们宣布战争为非法的话，唯一的另一个解决办法就是谈判。然而，在这种情况下，必须创造和平气氛。”
    尼赫鲁同一天在波恩政府新闻处举行记者招待会。他在记者招待会上反驳了杜勒斯侮辱中立主义是“不道德的”说法。尼赫鲁说，最近对中立究竟是“道德的”还是“不道德的”这一点进行的争论是好战思想的表现。他接着说，除非是在战争期间，他是不能想到中立的。他又说，今天对于政治家来说，重要的是要避免用战争赌博来解决国际问题。任何战争、任何为了战争而作的准备以及战争的一切后果都是不道德的。
    在谈到阿尔及利亚问题的时候，尼赫鲁表示印度不会拒绝要它帮助谋求解决阿尔及利亚问题的办法的请求。
