Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, July 5th: A Nepalese government spokesman announced on July 5th that the government had promptly arrested twelve people at midnight on July 4th for plotting to overthrow the government. The spokesman said that one of these people had a reputation for being "pro-American."

The spokesman said that there was a "large background" behind the plot to overthrow the government of King Mahendra of Nepal. Nepalese intelligence officials will investigate the source of funding for this plot.

He also said that some of the twelve people arrested were former army officers.

Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, July 10th: Indian newspapers have expressed deep concern about the recent discovery of a plot to overthrow the government in Nepal.

The "Deccan Herald" mentioned on July 7th that among the conspirators arrested in Nepal was a person with a "pro-American reputation." The newspaper's editorial stated that, given this background of the conspiracy and Nepal's strategically important position, this conspiracy case has particularly aroused India's concern.

The "National Herald" emphasized that in Nepal there are "too many explorers, from anthropologists to botanists, whose purposes are very ambiguous." The newspaper said: "This unrestricted roaming has brought some insecurity to this small country, and its greatest security at present is to be good neighbors with India and China."

The "National Herald" said that in the eyes of many foreigners, Nepal seems to be a "mysterious kingdom from which one can not only climb Mount Everest, but also engage in political adventures."

The "Indian Nation" published an editorial on July 7th stating: The discovery of the conspiracy will be an appeal to the various democratic parties in Nepal, urging them to forget their party differences and cooperate to strengthen the democratic and progressive forces in Nepal.

The Indian Press Trust reported from Kathmandu on July 8th that the Prime Minister of Nepal, Acharya, the Chairman of the Nepalese Congress Party, Regmi, and another leader of the party, Koirala, had all received anonymous threatening letters threatening to assassinate them.

    尼泊尔逮捕一批颠覆分子
    印报抨击外国人在尼泊尔进行政治冒险
    据新华社新德里电　尼泊尔政府发言人在七月五日宣布，政府在七月四日午夜及时地逮捕了十二个阴谋推翻政府的人。这个发言人说，这些人中间有一个是向来有“亲美名声”的。
    这位发言人说，企图推翻尼泊尔国王马亨德拉政府的阴谋背后有“很大的背景”。尼泊尔情报官员们将调查资助这次阴谋的来源。
    他还说，在被捕的十二个人中间有一些前陆军军官。
    据新华社新德里10日电　印度报纸对于尼泊尔国内最近发现有推翻政府的阴谋一事表示深为不安。
    “德康先驱报”七月七日提到在尼泊尔逮捕的阴谋者当中有一名有“亲美名声”的人。这家报纸的社论说，鉴于阴谋有这样的背景、而尼泊尔在战略上占有重要的地位，这个阴谋案件特别引起了印度的关注。
      “国民先驱报”强调指出，在尼泊尔有“太多的勘察家，从人类学家一直到植物学家，他们的目的是很暖昧的”。这家报纸说：“这种毫无限制的漫游已经给这个小国带来某种不安全，而它目前最大的安全是同印度和中国做好邻居。”
      “国民先驱报”说，在许多外国人眼中把尼泊尔看作好像是“神秘王国，从那里，不但能够攀登埃佛勒斯峰（即珠穆朗玛峰），而且能够进行政治冒险”。
      “印度民族日报”七月七日发表社论说：阴谋的发现将成为对尼泊尔各民主党派的一个呼吁，促使它们忘掉党派的分歧，进行合作来加强尼泊尔的民主和进步力量。
    印度报业托辣斯七月八日自加德满都报道，尼泊尔首相阿查里雅、尼泊尔国大党主席雷格米和这个党的另一位领袖柯伊拉腊都收到了匿名恐吓信，信里威胁说要谋害他们的性命。
