    On Independent Thinking
    Xuan Zhu
    Someone asked: How can one think independently?
    I think: There could be many answers to this question, one of which might involve myriad words, citing classics, but with the effect of saying nothing at all.
    However, there is also another kind of answer:
    Those who don't read books are not necessarily incapable of independent thinking; however, those who read books rigidly, read only to memorize, only read one-sidedly without reading opposing viewpoints and other diverse perspectives, often develop a reliance on "walking with a cane" when thinking, ultimately leading to the atrophy of their independent thinking ability.
    People whose eyes only look upward and not downward, whose ears only like to hear praise and dislike criticism, who often only think of themselves and not others, face the potential danger of letting "thinking alone" replace independent thinking.
    Dogmatism is the enemy of independent thinking, and another enemy is the cult of personality.
    If broad knowledge is the breeding ground for independent thinking, then the spirit of democracy should nurture independent thinking.
    A frog in a well is unlikely to have the ability to think independently. A mimicking parrot probably never feels the need for independent thinking. And a courier galloping hundreds of miles a day, though well-traveled and knowledgeable, may not be good at independent thinking.
    The human brain inherently possesses the ability to think independently. If it didn't, humanity could not have evolved from "stupid as deer and pigs" to civilization. But this human talent is gradually developed in the process of constantly encountering contradictions and constantly resolving them in the struggle of life. The experiences and independent thinking achievements of predecessors should be the capital for later generations to conduct independent thinking, not idols that stifle independent thinking.
    When children's knowledge first begins to develop, they often imitate adults. This imitation is the absorption of the experience and knowledge of the previous generation, preparing conditions for later independent thinking. When adults see young children imitating them, they praise them as "clever," but later, when they see teenagers who are gradually maturing no longer satisfied with imitating them, they scold them as "unfilial"; this is truly a laughable contradiction.
    In the past, some "families of poetry and etiquette" had a set of rules for raising children: from infancy to adulthood, they were required to "see no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil..." This was a method of placing children in a glass cover with the air extracted. Those cultivated in this way, if not bookworms or cynics, are mentally unbalanced freaks, soft people who cannot withstand the wind and frost. Of course, they will not be people with independent thinking abilities.
    "Families of poetry and etiquette" no longer exist now, and I hope that this kind of education method will also disappear with them forever.

    谈独立思考
    玄珠
    有人问：如何而能独立思考？
    我想：这个答案可以很多，其中之一也许是洋洋万言，引经据典，而效果等于不着一字。
    但是，也还有另一方式的答案：
    不读书者不一定就不能独立思考；然而，读死书、死读书、只读一面的书而不读反面的和其他多方面的书，却往往会养成思考时的“扶杖而行”，以致最后弄到独立思考能力的萎缩。
    眼睛只看上边、不看下边的人，耳朵只喜欢听好话、不喜欢听批评的人，常常只想到自己、不想到别人的人，他们面前的可能的危险是：让“独自”思考顶替了独立思考。
    教条主义是独立思考的敌人，它的另一敌人便是个人崇拜。
    如果广博的知识是孕育独立思考的，那么，哺养独立思考的便应是民主的精神。
    井底之蛙恐怕很难有独立思考的能力。应声虫大概从没有感到有独立思考之必要。而日驰数百里的驿马虽然见多识广，也未必善于独立思考。
    人类的头脑，本来是具有独立思考的能力的。如果没有，人类就不能从“蠢如鹿豕”进化到文明。但是人类的这个天赋，是在生活斗争中不断碰到矛盾而又不断解决矛盾的过程中逐渐发达起来的。前人的经验和独立思考的成果，应当是后人所借以进行独立思考的资本，而不是窒息独立思考的偶像。
    儿童的知识初开，常常模仿大人。这时的模仿，就是吸收前一代的经验和知识，为后来的独立思考准备条件。做大人的，看见幼儿模仿自己，便赞一声“聪明”，可是到后来看见渐臻成熟的少年不再满足于模仿自己，却又骂他“不肖”；这真是可笑的矛盾。
    从前有些“诗礼之家”，有一套教养子女的规矩：自孩提以至成长，必使“非礼勿视，非礼勿听，非礼勿言……”这是把儿童放在抽出了空气的玻璃罩内的办法。这样培养出来的，如果不是书呆子，是犬儒，便是精神上失去平衡的畸形人，是经不起风霜的软体人。当然也不会是具有独立思考能力的人。
    “诗礼之家”现在没有了，我盼望这样的教养方法也和它一同地永远消逝。
