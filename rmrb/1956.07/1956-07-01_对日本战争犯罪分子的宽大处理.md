According to the principles established in the decision of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress regarding the handling of Japanese war criminals who committed war crimes during the war of aggression against China, our government has begun to process the Japanese war criminals in custody. The Special Military Tribunal organized by the Supreme People's Court of our country has tried seventeen Japanese war criminals with particularly serious crimes in three cases in Shenyang and Taiyuan, and has leniently sentenced them to fixed-term imprisonment according to the crimes they committed and their performance during detention. At the same time, the Supreme People's Procuratorate of our country has leniently treated the first batch of 335 Japanese war criminals who were of secondary importance or showed better repentance, exempting them from prosecution, releasing them immediately, and handing them over to the Red Cross Society of our country on June 28 to assist them in returning to their country. Our government will continue to process other Japanese war criminals in custody in accordance with our country's legal procedures in the near future. The Chinese Red Cross Society also reached an agreement on June 28 with representatives of three Japanese organizations, including the Japanese Red Cross Society, the Japanese Peace Liaison Council, and the Japan-China Friendship Association, on matters such as continuing to assist in repatriating the second batch of Japanese war criminals who are about to be exempted from prosecution and released, and assisting family members of Japanese war criminals serving sentences in China to visit their relatives.

The Japanese militarist forces, which had already been defeated in the war of aggression, completely disregarded international law and humanitarian principles during the war of aggression against our country, committing countless crimes against our people and causing enormous losses to the lives and property of our people. Handling Japanese war criminals who committed war crimes against our country according to our country's legal procedures is not only the just demand of the Chinese people, but also entirely a matter of our country's sovereignty.

It is known that most of the Japanese war criminals in the war of aggression against our country, including some of the chief war criminals, were dealt with by the International Military Tribunal for the Far East and the then Chinese government after Japan's surrender. The Japanese war criminals currently detained by our government were partly arrested during our country's War of Liberation, and mostly transferred to our government by the Soviet government in 1950. All these Japanese war criminals committed various war crimes of varying degrees during the Japanese militarist aggression against our country. Among them, except for a very few who committed more serious crimes, most were Japanese war criminals who committed general crimes in the Japanese militarist aggression against our country, and some were driven by Japanese militarism to participate in the war of aggression and committed crimes under the orders and instructions of their superiors.

For these Japanese war criminals, our government and people have sufficient reasons to punish them severely according to the crimes they committed. If this were not done, the Chinese people, who suffered the most from the scourge of Japanese militarism, would never agree. Similarly, as a Japanese friend who recently visited China said, if this were not done, the Japanese people would not clearly know how deep the crimes committed by Japanese militarism in China were. However, as pointed out in the decision of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of our country, our government and people, "in view of the changes in the situation and the current situation ten years after Japan's surrender, in view of the development of friendly relations between the Chinese and Japanese people in recent years, and in view of the fact that the vast majority of these war criminals have shown varying degrees of repentance during their detention, have therefore decided to treat these war criminals separately in accordance with the policy of leniency." Even for those war criminals who were brought to trial, although they were all active supporters and implementers of the Japanese militarist aggressive bloc's war of aggression against our country and colonial rule in our country's occupied areas, and some even joined the Chiang Kai-shek and Yan Xishan counter-revolutionary cliques after Japan's surrender, continuing to be enemies of the Chinese people and committing serious crimes, since they have shown repentance, our government still treats them leniently, without sentencing any to death or life imprisonment, but only to fixed-term imprisonment ranging from eight to twenty years, and counting one day for one day from the date of detention; if they perform well during their imprisonment, commutation and even early release may be considered. As for war criminals whose crimes are relatively minor and who show better repentance, they will be exempted from prosecution and released in batches, allowing them to return to Japan and reunite with their families. This not only fully demonstrates the spirit of our country's policy of leniency, but also fully demonstrates the Chinese people's high confidence in easing international tensions and consolidating lasting world peace.

As Premier Zhou Enlai clearly pointed out in his speech at the Third Session of the National People's Congress on June 28: "Due to the development of friendly relations between the Chinese and Japanese people and Japan's current situation, although the state of war between China and Japan has not ended, the Chinese government is now still proactively handling Japanese war criminals who have been detained and reviewed for a long time in accordance with the policy of leniency," "The Chinese government's handling of these war criminals is completely consistent with the spirit we expressed in the past to Japanese friends visiting China. The reason why the Chinese government has made these continuous efforts is because we have correctly estimated the strong desire of the Chinese and Japanese people to live in peace and have friendly exchanges, and to restore normal relations between the two countries as soon as possible."

Our government's handling of Japanese war criminals is obviously timely and correct. This fully conforms to the long-term interests of our people, is conducive to the development of friendly relations between the Chinese and Japanese people, and is conducive to consolidating peace in the Far East and the world, and therefore will inevitably be supported by our people and the Japanese people, and will also inevitably be sympathized and supported by peace-loving people all over the world.

### 对日本战争犯罪分子的宽大处理

    对日本战争犯罪分子的宽大处理
    根据全国人民代表大会常务委员会关于处理在押日本侵略中国战争中战争犯罪分子的决定所确立的原则，我国政府已经开始对在押的日本战争犯罪分子进行处理。我国最高人民法院组织的特别军事法庭，已在沈阳和太原两地，分三个案件审讯了十七名罪行特别重大的日本战争犯罪分子，并且按照他们所犯的罪行和在押期间的表现，从宽分别判处了徒刑。同时，我国最高人民检察院对第一批335名次要的或者悔罪表现较好的日本战争犯罪分子实行了宽大处理，免予起诉，立即释放，并且已经交由我国红十字会于六月二十八日协助遣送他们回国。对其他在押的日本战争犯罪分子，我国政府在最近期间将继续按照我国的法律程序予以处理。中国红十字会对继续协助遣送第二批行将免予起诉和释放的日本战争犯罪分子回国，以及协助服刑中的日本战争犯罪分子家属前来中国探视其亲人等等事宜，也于六月二十八日同日本红十字会、日本和平联络会、日中友好协会等三团体代表达成了协议。
    在侵略战争中已经遭受失败的日本军国主义势力，在侵略我国的战争期间，曾经完全蔑视国际法准则和人道原则，对我国人民犯了难以数计的各种罪行，使我国人民的生命财产蒙受了极大的损失。按照我国的法律程序处理对我国犯有战争罪行的日本战争犯罪分子，这不仅是中国人民的正义要求，而且完全是属于我国主权的事情。
    人们知道，日本侵略我国战争中的大部分战争犯罪分子，包括一些首要的战争犯罪分子，在日本投降以后，曾经远东国际军事法庭和当时的中国政府作了处理。我国政府现在关押的这些战争犯罪分子，一部分是在我国解放战争期间逮捕的，大部分是在1950年由苏联政府移交我国政府的。所有这些日本战争犯罪分子，在日本军国主义侵略我国的战争中，都犯有程度不等的各种战争罪行。其中除极少数是犯有较严重的罪行以外，大多数是在日本军国主义侵略我国战争中犯有一般罪行的战争犯罪分子，也有一些是被日本军国主义驱使参加侵略战争，在他们的长官命令指示下犯罪的。
    对于这些日本战争犯罪分子，我国政府和人民是有充分理由按照他们所犯的罪行给以严正的惩办的。如果不这样做，受日本军国主义祸害最深的中国人民是断不会答应的。同样地，正如最近在中国访问的一位日本朋友所说，如果不这样做，也不能使日本人民明白地知道日本军国主义在中国所犯的罪行是何等的深重。但是，正如我国全国人民代表大会常务委员会的决定中所指出的，我国政府和人民“鉴于日本投降后十年来情况的变化和现在的处境，鉴于近年来中日两国人民友好关系的发展，鉴于这些战争犯罪分子在关押期间绝大多数已有不同程度的悔罪表现，因此，决定对于这些战争犯罪分子按照宽大政策分别予以处理。”就是对于那些交付审判的战争犯罪分子，虽然他们都是日本军国主义侵略集团对我国进行侵略战争和对我国被占领地区实行殖民统治的积极支持者和执行者，有的在日本投降后又参加了蒋介石、阎锡山反革命集团，继续与中国人民为敌，犯有严重罪行，但是，既然他们有悔罪的表示，我国政府对他们仍然从宽处理，没有一个判处死刑和无期徒刑，只分别判处了从八年到二十年的有期徒刑，并且从拘押之日起算，一日抵算一日；如果服刑期间表现良好，还可以考虑减刑以至提前释放。至于罪行较轻、悔罪表现较好的战争犯罪分子，则免予起诉，分期释放，让他们返回日本与家人团聚。这不仅充分表现了我国宽大政策的精神，而且也充分显示了中国人民对于和缓国际紧张局势和巩固世界持久和平的高度信心。
    正如周恩来总理六月二十八日在全国人民代表大会第三次会议上的发言中所明确指出的：“由于中日两国人民友好关系的发展和日本现时的处境，尽管中日两国之间的战争状态还没有结束，中国政府现在仍然主动地按照宽大政策分别处理了经过长期关押和审查的日本战争犯罪分子，”“中国政府对于这些战争犯罪分子的处理，同我们过去对访问中国的日本朋友所表示的精神是完全一致的。中国政府所以作出这些不断的努力，是由于我们正确地估计了中日两国人民要求和平共处和友好来往、要求两国早日恢复正常关系的强烈愿望。”
    我国政府对于日本战争犯罪分子的处理，显然是适时的和正确的。这完全符合我国人民的长远利益，有利于中日两国人民友好关系的发展，有利于巩固远东和世界的和平，因此必然会得到我国人民和日本人民的拥护，也必然会得到世界爱好和平的人民的同情和支持。
