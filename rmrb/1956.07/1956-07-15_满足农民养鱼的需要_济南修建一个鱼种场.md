Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, July 13th. Shandong Province's first fish fry farm—the Jinan Fish Fry Farm—began construction today.

	This fish fry farm is being built in the suburbs of Jinan, on the north bank of the Xiaoqing River, covering an area of two hundred mu. The fish fry farm plans to build seventy-five fish ponds of varying sizes and depths, raising ten million fish fry, which can supply the needs of 50,000 mu of aquaculture water surface. The entire fish fry farm will be completed by the end of October. The first phase of the project (accounting for half of the entire project) will be completed in early August.

	The Shandong Provincial Aquatic Products Bureau has ordered four million fish fry from Anhui Province, including four types of fast-growing freshwater fish: black carp, grass carp (Chinese ide), silver carp, and bighead carp. When the first phase of the project is completed, the fish fry will all be put into the ponds. The Shandong Provincial Aquatic Products Bureau has also sent people to Jin County, Liaoning Province, to purchase the precious mirror carp, which will be raised in the parent fish pond so that they can lay eggs and hatch, and small fry will be cultivated artificially.

	Agricultural production cooperatives in various parts of Shandong Province are actively using water sources such as ponds, reservoirs, and bays to develop fish farming as a sideline. This spring, agricultural production cooperatives in various places wrote to the Shandong Provincial Aquatic Products Bureau, requesting the supply of fish fry. The construction of the Jinan Fish Fry Farm will gradually meet this need of the farmers.

    满足农民养鱼的需要
    济南修建一个鱼种场
    新华社济南13日电　山东省第一座鱼种场——济南鱼种场，今天开始动工修建。
    这个鱼种场修建在济南市郊区，小清河北岸，面积有二百市亩。这个鱼种场计划修建七十五个大小深浅不同的养鱼池，饲养一千万尾鱼苗，可以供应五万市亩养殖水面的需要。整个鱼种场将在十月底建成。其中第一期工程（占全部工程的一半），八月上旬就可以完工。
    山东省水产局已经从安徽省定购了四百万尾鱼苗。其中有青鱼、草鱼（鲩鱼）、白鲢、花鲢四种成长较快的淡水鱼。第一期工程完工的时候，鱼苗即可全部下塘。山东省水产局还派人到辽宁省金县采购了珍贵的镜鲤，准备饲养在亲鱼池里，使它产卵孵化，用人工培殖小苗。
    山东省各地农业生产合作社正积极利用池塘、水库、水湾等水源开展养鱼副业。今年春季，各地农业生产合作社曾纷纷写信给山东省水产局，要求供应鱼苗。济南鱼种场的修建，将逐步地满足农民的这种需要。
