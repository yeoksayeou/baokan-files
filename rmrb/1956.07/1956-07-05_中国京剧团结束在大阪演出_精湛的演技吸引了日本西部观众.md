Xinhua News Agency, Osaka, July 4th: The Chinese Peking Opera Troupe concluded its performances in Osaka last night. The Peking Opera Troupe performed a total of six shows over four days in Osaka, with a total audience of more than 16,000 people.

The Chinese Peking Opera performances not only caused a sensation in Osaka, but also attracted people from western Japan. They traveled long distances by train from Kobe, Shingu, Hiroshima Prefecture, and even eight middle school teachers came by boat from Kochi Prefecture in Shikoku to see the Peking Opera.

Renowned Japanese writers Fujisawa桓夫, Kyoto University professors Yoshikawa Kojiro, Ogawa Tamaki, and Tsukamoto Shigeki published their impressions in "Asahi Shimbun" and "Mainichi Shimbun," praising the high artistic level of Peking Opera and the actors' superb performance skills, and lively and powerful movements.

Ohtani Tomoemon, a famous young Kabuki actor, said after watching Peking Opera: I am very surprised and moved. The rich content of Peking Opera, the extremely powerful performance methods, and the beautiful and delicate postures of the Dan roles, etc., are reflected in my mind. Ohtani said that he is also a male actor who plays Dan roles, so he paid special attention to Mei Lanfang's performance. When Yu Ji in "Farewell My Concubine" danced with her sword for the overlord in the enemy's siege, advising him to break through, he was so moved that he shed tears.

    中国京剧团结束在大阪演出
    精湛的演技吸引了日本西部观众
    据新华社大阪4日电　中国京剧代表团昨天晚上结束了在大阪的演出。京剧团在大阪共演出四天六场，观众共达一万六千多人。
    中国京剧的演出不仅轰动了大阪，并且吸引了日本西部地区的人们。他们从神户市、新宫市、广岛县等地乘火车远道来到大阪，甚至还有八位中学教师从四国的高知县坐船赶来看京戏。
    日本著名作家藤泽桓夫，京都大学教授吉川幸次郎、小川环树、贝冢茂树等人分别在“朝日新闻”、“每日新闻”发表感想，赞扬京剧的高度艺术水平和演员的精湛的表演技术，活泼有力的动作。
    日本歌舞伎著名青年演员大谷友右卫门看过京剧后说：我很惊讶，感动。京剧的丰富内容，极有魄力的表现方法，旦角的优美细腻的姿态等等，影射在我的头脑里。大谷说，他也是扮演旦角的男演员，所以对梅兰芳的表演特别注意。当“霸王别姬”中的虞姬在敌人重围的阵地中给霸王舞剑，劝他杀出重围的时候，他感动得流下了眼泪。
