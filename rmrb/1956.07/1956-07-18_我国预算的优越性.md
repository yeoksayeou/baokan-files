The following is what I want to talk about today is the "Report on the 1955 National Final Accounts and the 1956 National Budget" presented by Vice Premier Li Xiannian on behalf of the State Council. I will use the income and expenditure figures in the report to make a theoretical explanation and a scientific interpretation. I will clarify it in eight points below:

The first point is that the purpose of our country's socialist revolution is to change the relations of production and improve the productive forces. However, without advanced production tools, advanced production systems, and advanced production methods, even if the relations of production are changed, it is still not enough to improve the productive forces. Therefore, according to the 1955 final accounts (taking agricultural production as an example), the government supplied farmers with 4.5 million tons of cake fertilizer and chemical fertilizer, 90,000 tons of pesticides, and supplied 510,000 new-style farm implements at a 40% discount. The government continued to allocate 300 million yuan to disaster areas in 1954 for dike restoration and embankment repairs, helped farmers build and repair many small-scale water conservancy projects, lent 170,000 waterwheels, and expanded and improved the irrigated area by 65 million mu. In terms of water conservancy construction, in 1955, more than 1.4 billion cubic meters of earthwork, more than 14 million cubic meters of stonework, and 600,000 cubic meters of concrete were completed.

As for the advanced production system, the single-season rice that farmers are accustomed to is changed to double-season rice (continuous cropping and intercropping) where conditions permit, and the production methods are deep plowing and close planting.

What are the results of adopting advanced production materials, production systems, and production methods? The results are very good. In 1955, agricultural production in most parts of the country achieved a bumper harvest. This bumper harvest is also related to the climate in 1955. The total grain output reached 368 billion jin, completing 102% of the annual plan, an increase of 9% compared with 1954; cotton output reached 30.36 million dan, completing 117% of the annual plan, an increase of 43% compared with 1954. Other major crops, except for sugarcane, which decreased slightly compared with 1954, all had different degrees of increase: sugar beet increased by 61% compared with 1954, jute increased by 95%, flue-cured tobacco increased by 28%, peanuts increased by 6%, tea increased by 17%, silkworm cocoons increased by 44%, and various fruits increased by 10%.

The second point is that since the productive forces have been improved and agricultural production in most areas has achieved a bumper harvest, the income of farmers should also increase. Therefore, the 1956 budget report says: "After agriculture has been cooperativized, in order to enable farmers to increase their income, cooperatives must accurately distribute income, that is, do not take too much of the production income for production expenses, public accumulation funds, and public welfare funds, but try to ensure that the income of the vast majority of farmers increases year by year," and maintain a reasonable ratio between the prices of industrial products and agricultural products. At the same time, the government will never overburden farmers. Therefore, in 1953, it stipulated the policy of stabilizing the total amount of burden within three years and not increasing taxes with increased production, stabilizing the total amount of collection (including local surcharges and village self-raised funds) at the level of 38.8 billion jin of refined grain in the summer and autumn collections of 1952. If the income of farmers has increased, can the wages of workers not be increased? No. In recent years, with the rapid establishment of socialist industry and the rapid development of the socialist transformation of private enterprises, industrial productivity has also been greatly improved. Compared with 1954, the output of most industrial products has increased in 1955: raw coal increased by 17%, coke increased by 22%, electricity increased by 12%, crude oil increased by 22%, pig iron increased by 23%, steel increased by 28%, steel products increased by 28%, sulfuric acid increased by 9%, caustic soda increased by 18%, sulfur? increased by 9%, locomotives increased by 88%, internal combustion engines increased by 36%, and generators increased by 97%. Because industrial productivity has increased, the wages of workers must also be increased. The 1956 budget stipulates that the average wage of employees nationwide will increase by 14.5%, among which the wages of material production sectors, key construction areas, senior scientific and technical personnel, and senior skilled workers will have a greater increase.

The third point is that the income of farmers and the wages of workers have increased, so their purchasing power has also increased. The means of livelihood they need must also be appropriately increased. Therefore, the government decided to appropriately develop light industry in order to better meet the needs of the people. Therefore, the 1956 budget increased the expenditure on light industry. Because most of the light industrial products are produced to meet the material and cultural needs of the people, if you really want to improve the lives of the people, it is not enough to just increase wages, but also to enable them to buy more cheap and good things, which is the reason for developing light industry production. The original Five-Year Plan stipulated that the investment ratio of heavy industry and light industry was 88.8% to 11.2%, which is approximately equal to eight to one. Now that we want to develop light industry production to meet the material and cultural needs of the people, we must increase some investment in light industry, so we must slightly change the above 88.8% to 11.2% ratio to 87.5% to 12.5%, which is approximately equal to seven to one (according to the report of Vice Premier Li Fuchun). It seems that such a change has some impact on heavy industry, but it is not the case, because the characteristics of light industry are less investment, easy construction, high profits, and fast profits, which can more effectively accumulate funds and use them to develop heavy industry more and faster.

The fourth point is that the income of farmers and the wages of workers have increased, and their unity will definitely be more consolidated. This is an inevitable result. However, why did the wages of workers and the income of farmers increase at the same time? Is there any mutual connection between them? Yes. For example, 1953 was the year with the fastest industrial growth rate. The total industrial output value increased by 31.7% compared with 1952, mainly because agriculture in 1952 had a bumper harvest, bringing sufficient materials to industry in 1953. For example, 1955 was the year with the slowest industrial growth rate. The total industrial output value increased by only 8% compared with the previous year, mainly because agricultural production in 1953 and 1954 encountered poor harvests, and the cotton output in 1954 was 18.3% less than in 1952, which made the industry unable to continue to advance due to insufficient raw materials supplied by agriculture. It can be seen that there is an interdependent relationship between industry and agriculture, which is the material basis of the worker-peasant alliance.

The fifth point is that the means of livelihood needed by the people have increased, that is, the output of light industry has increased. Therefore, the total retail sales of social commodities in 1956 will inevitably increase, and it is expected to reach 46 billion yuan, which is 15% higher than the previous year, only 3.8 billion yuan less than the 49.8 billion yuan stipulated in the Five-Year Plan for 1957. The retail plan for major commodities and daily necessities in 1956 has increased to varying degrees compared with the previous year.

The sixth point is that the task of socialism is to improve not only material life but also cultural life, but what has been said above is only about the improvement of material life. What about cultural life? Should it also be improved? Yes. The 1956 budget stipulates that: "Expenditure on culture, education, science, and health will be more than 3.5 billion yuan, an increase of 25.34% over the previous year. In 1956, national universities and colleges will enroll 163,000 new students and graduate 64,000 students. The number of students in school will reach more than 380,000, an increase of 32% over the previous year. Secondary vocational schools will enroll 444,000 new students and graduate 179,000 students. The number of students in school will reach 801,000, an increase of 49% over the previous year. General middle schools (including senior high schools and junior high schools) will enroll 2,137,000 new students and graduate 976,000 students. The number of students in school will reach 5.06 million, an increase of 30% over the previous year. Primary schools will enroll 23 million new students and graduate 13.8 million students. The number of students in school will reach more than 62 million, an increase of 17% over the previous year. In 1956, national hospitals and sanatoriums will add 60,000 beds, totaling 339,000 beds, an increase of 22% over the previous year. In 1956, the national budget for scientific undertakings will increase by more than double compared with the previous year.

The seventh point is that in order to ensure the improvement of material life and cultural life, the 1956 national budget spends a total of 64.96% of the total expenditure of the year on economic construction and cultural and educational undertakings, of which economic construction expenditure is more than 16 billion yuan, accounting for 52.22% of the budget expenditure of the year, an increase of 17.04% over the final accounts of economic construction expenditure in 1955. Expenditure on social, cultural and educational undertakings is more than 3.9 billion yuan, accounting for 12.74% of the budget expenditure of the year, an increase of 18.36% compared with 1955.

From the above, it can be seen that two-thirds of our country's budget income is used for economic construction and cultural construction, which has never been seen in the budgets of capitalist countries. The superiority of socialism lies in this. On the contrary, the primary position in the budgets of capitalist countries is defense expenditure. What about our country's defense expenditure? In 1956, the proportion of our country's defense expenditure in the national expenditure budget was 19.98%, a decrease of 2.17% compared with the proportion of defense expenditure in the final accounts of expenditure in 1955. This alone is enough to prove the direction of our country's peaceful policy and enough to prove the wishes of all the people of our country.

The eighth point is that the expenditure on economic construction, cultural and health construction, and defense expenditure is very large. May I ask where the funds come from? The funds come from the income of state-owned enterprises and various taxes. The income of state-owned enterprises includes the income of state-owned industrial enterprises, the income of state-owned transportation enterprises, the income of state-owned commercial enterprises, the income of state-owned agricultural and forestry enterprises, and the income of other enterprises and institutions, totaling more than 14.3 billion yuan, accounting for 48.19% of the budget income of the year. Various taxes include industrial and commercial taxes, agricultural taxes, customs duties, and salt taxes, totaling more than 13.9 billion yuan, accounting for 47.02% of the budget income of the year. Among the 13.9 billion yuan in tax revenue, industrial and commercial tax revenue alone accounts for more than 9.9 billion yuan, mainly due to the relatively rapid growth of industrial and agricultural production and commodity circulation in 1956. In addition, agricultural tax revenue is more than 3 billion yuan.

Looking at the above-mentioned incomes as a whole, most of them are the income of socialist enterprises and the industrial, agricultural, and commercial taxes of a socialist nature. It can be said that the money is taken from the people, but it is also used for the people, which is completely in line with the principles of socialism, thus ensuring that our country can successfully transition to socialism.

    我国预算的优越性
    马寅初
    我今天要讲的是李先念副总理代国务院所提出的“关于1955年国家决算和1956年国家预算的报告”，我用报告中的收支数目字，作一个理论上的说明和科学上的解释。以下我分八点把它说清楚：
    第一点是我国的社会主义革命的目的在使生产关系改变和生产力的提高，但没有先进的生产工具先进的生产制度和先进的生产方法，虽然改变了生产关系，仍然不足以提高生产力。所以依照1955年的决算（以农业生产为例），政府供应农民饼肥和化学肥料450万吨、农药9万吨，并且减价40％供应新式农具51万部，对1954年的灾区政府继续拨付复堤、修垸经费3亿元，帮助农民新修和整修了许多小型水利工程，贷放水车17万辆，扩大和改善了灌溉面积6，500万亩。在水利建设方面，1955年完成土方14亿多公方，石方1，400多万公方，混凝土60万公方。
    至于先进的生产制度，则农民所习惯的单季稻，如条件许可，都改为双季稻（连作稻和间作稻），生产方法是深耕密植。
    采用先进的生产资料、生产制度和生产方法的结果如何呢？结果很好。1955年全国绝大部分地区的农业获得了丰收，这个丰收与1955年的气候也不无关系，粮食总产量达到3，680亿斤，完成年度计划的102％，比1954年增长9％；棉花产量达到3，036万担，完成年度计划的117％，比1954年增长43％，其他各种主要农作物，除了甘蔗比1954年稍有减少外，都有不同的增长：甜菜比1954年增长61％，黄麻增长95％，烤烟增长28％，花生增长6％，茶叶增长17％，蚕茧增长44％，各种水果增长10％。
    第二点是生产力既然提高了，大部分地区的农业既然获得了丰收，则农民的收入也应该增加，所以1956年的预算报告说：“在农业已经合作化以后，为了使农民能够增加收入，合作社必须准确地分配收入，这就是说不要从生产所得中拿过多的部分用在生产费用、公积金和公益金方面去，而要尽力保证最大多数农户的收入逐年有所增加，”并且使工业品和农业品的价格保持合理的比例。同时政府决不使农民的负担过重，所以在1953年规定了三年以内稳定负担总额，增产不增税的方针，把总的征收数额（包括地方附加和乡村自筹经费）稳定在1952年夏征和秋征总额388亿斤细粮的水平上。农民的收入增加了，工人的工资可以不增加吗？不。这几年来，社会主义工业的迅速建立和私营企业社会主义改造的迅速发展，工业生产力也大大地提高了，1955年与1954年比较，绝大多数工业产品的产量都有增长：原煤增长17％，焦炭增长22％，电力增长12％，原油增长22％，生铁增长23％，钢增长28％，钢材增长28％，硫酸增长9％，烧碱增长18％，硫?增长9％，机车增长88％，内燃机增长36％，发电机增长97％。因为工业生产力提高了，所以工人的工资也要提高，1956年的预算规定全国职工的平均工资将提高14.5％，其中物质生产部门、重点建设地区、高级科学技术人员和高级技术工人的工资将有较多的提高。
    第三点是生产力提高了，农民的收入和工人的工资都增加了，因此他们的购买力也加大了。他们所需要的生活资料也必须适当地增加，因此政府决定适当地发展轻工业，以便更好地满足人民的需要，所以1956年的预算把轻工业的支出增加了。因为轻工业产品的绝大部分都是为了满足人民的物质和文化生活的需要而生产的，如果真正要改善人民的生活，只增加工资还不行，还要使他们能够买到更多的价廉物美的东西，这就是要发展轻工业生产的道理。五年计划原来规定重工业和轻工业的投资比例88.8％比11.2％，约等于八比一。现在既要发展轻工业的生产以满足人民的物质和文化生活的需要，就要增加一些轻工业方面的投资，所以要把以上的88.8％比11.2％的比例稍稍更动一下，改为87.5％比12.5％，约等于七比一（据李富春副总理的报告）。看起来，好像这样更动于重工业不无影响，其实不然，因为轻工业的特点是投资少，建设易，获利多而且快，可以更有效地积累资金，用来更多更快地发展重工业。
    第四点是农民的收入和工人的工资都增加了，他们之间的团结一定更加巩固，这是必然的结果。但是，工人的工资何以与农民的收入同时增加呢？其间有无相互的联系呢？有的。例如1953年是工业增长速度最快的一年，工业总产值比1952年增加了31.7％，主要的原因是1952年的农业获得丰收，给1953年的工业带来了足够的资料。又如1955年是工业增长速度最慢的一年，工业总产值比上年只增加了
  8％，主要原因是1953年、1954年两年的农业生产遇到欠收，1954年的棉花产量比1952年还少18.3％，这样就使得工业因农业供应的原料不够，不能继续前进。由此可知，工业与农业之间有相依为命的关系，这就是工农联盟的物质基础。
    第五点是人民所需要的生活资料增加了，就是轻工业的出品加多了，因此之故，1956年社会商品零售总额势必增加，预计将达到460亿元，要比上年增长15％，比五年计划中规定的1957年的水平498亿元只差38亿元。1956年主要商品和日用百货的零售计划，比上年都有不同程度的增长。
    第六点是社会主义的任务在提高物质生活之外还要提高文化生活，但以上各点所说的，只是关于物质生活的提高，至于文化生活怎样呢？是否也要提高呢？是的。1956年的预算规定：“文化、教育、科学、卫生事业支出为35亿多元，比上年增长25.34％。1956年全国高等学校新招生16.3万人，毕业学生6.4万人，在校学生将达到38万多人，比上年增长32％。中等专业学校新招生44.4万人，毕业学生17.9万人，在校学生达到80.1万人，比上年增长49％。普通中学（包括高中和初中）新招生213.7万人，毕业学生97.6万人，在校学生达到506万人，比上年增长30％。小学校新招生2，300万人，毕业学生1，380万人，在校学生达到6，200万人以上，比上年增长17％。1956年全国医院和疗养院病床将增设6万张，总数达到33.9万张，比上年增长22％。1956年内国家预算对科学事业的支出比上年增加一倍以上。
    第七点是为保证物质生活和文化生活的提高，1956年国家预算用在经济建设和文化教育事业的支出，共占本年支出总数的64.96％，其中经济建设支出为160亿多元，占本年预算支出的52.22％，比1955年经济建设支出决算数增长17.04％。社会文教事业支出为39亿多元，占本年预算支出的12.74％，同1955年比较增长18.36％。
    从以上所述可见我国的预算以三分之二的收入用于经济建设事业和文化建设事业，这是在资本主义国家的预算中所从未见到的，社会主义的优越性就在于此。相反的资本主义国家预算中占首要地位的是国防支出，而我国的国防支出怎么样呢？1956年我国国防费在国家支出预算中所占的比重为19.98％，比1955年国防费在支出决算中所占的比重下降2.17％，仅此一端，已足以证明我国的和平政策之所向，亦足以证明我国全体人民的愿望之所在。
    第八点是经济建设事业和文教卫生建设事业的支出以及国防费的支出为数甚大，试问款从何来？款从国营企业收入和各项税收而来。国营企业收入包括国营工业企业收入，国营交通企业收入，国营商业企业收入，国营农林企业收入，及其他企业和事业收入，共为143亿多元，占本年预算收入的48.19％，各项税收包括工商税收、农业税收、关税、盐税共为139亿多元，占本年预算收入的47.02％。在此139亿元税收中，仅工商税收一项占99亿多元，主要是由于1956年工农业生产和商品流转的增长比较快。此外农业税收入为30亿多元。
    把以上各项收入总起来看，大半是社会主义企业的收入和社会主义事业性质的工农商税收，可以说钱是取之于民，但亦用之于民，完全合乎社会主义的原则的，这样就保证我国可以胜利地过渡到社会主义。
