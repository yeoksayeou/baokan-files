On the morning of January 26th of this year, Huang Nianggong, a young apprentice at the jointly owned public-private Guangzhou Ship Repair Factory, suddenly committed suicide by taking poison (he was rescued and did not die). Why would a young person growing up in a society filled with sunshine seek death? It turned out that he was unjustly accused and forced into it. People must be very surprised, who today still dares to force someone to death and defy the law? This person is none other than Wang Xuehai, the head of the Economic Security Section of the Guangzhou Ship Repair Factory.

On the afternoon of January 23rd, after this section chief discovered that another apprentice, Lin Jiuji's, suitcase had been cut, instead of conducting an in-depth investigation, instead of carefully analyzing the situation, he subjectively and arbitrarily took illegal measures of binding and coercing a confession from Huang Nianggong for three consecutive nights of "illegal interrogation." After the serious incident of Huang Nianggong's suicide, the Party organization of this factory only gave Wang Xuehai a light punishment of "Party internal admonishment." Although the Guangzhou Municipal People's Procuratorate conducted an investigation into this incident, although it suggested a retrial, and although it repeatedly urged it, to this day, there has been no retrial. What to do? Should we continue to patiently "wait?" Or should we immediately take effective measures to uphold the dignity of the law and give lawless and undisciplined elements the punishment they deserve? This depends on what attitude the Guangzhou Municipal People's Procuratorate takes towards the people's trust and its own responsibilities!

    还要等待到何时
    今年一月二十六日上午，公私合营广州船舶修理厂的青年学徒黄娘恭忽然服毒自杀（遇救未死）。为什么一个生长在充满阳光的社会里的青年要自寻短见呢？原来他是含冤莫白，被迫出此。人们一定很奇怪，什么人在今天还胆敢逼死人命以身试法，这个人不是别人，就是广州船舶修理厂的经济保卫股长王学海。
    这个股长在一月二十三日下午发现另一学徒林就基的皮箱被人割破以后，不是深入地调查研究，不是细致地分析情况，而是察言观色，主观武断，就采取捆绑逼供的非法手段对黄娘恭进行了连续三晚的“非法审讯。黄娘恭自杀的严重事件发生以后，这个厂的党组织只是对王学海作了一个“党内劝告”的轻轻的处分。广州市人民检察院虽然对这一事件作了检察，虽然建议要重新处理，虽然也一再催促过，可是，时至今日，并未重新处理。怎么办？是继续耐心地“等待”下去呢？还是立即采取有效措施维护法律的尊严，给违法乱纪分子以应得的惩治呢？这就要看广州市人民检察院究竟以什么态度对待人民的委托，对待自己的职责了！
