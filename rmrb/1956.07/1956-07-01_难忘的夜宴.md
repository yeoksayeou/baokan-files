    Unforgettable Evening Banquet
    Ma Shaobo
    In Tokyo, the entire delegation of the Chinese Peking Opera Troupe to Japan was invited by Mr. Ichikawa Ennosuke, a famous Japanese performing artist, to attend a welcoming evening banquet at his home. This gathering, full of friendship and boundless poetry, is deeply engraved in everyone's memory.
    When we went to the banquet, it was not yet dark, but slightly overcast. A cool, slanting breeze and drizzle accompanied us along the way. Upon arrival, before we even got out of the car, Mr. Ichikawa Ennosuke, his wife, family (brothers, sisters-in-law, sons, daughters, daughters-in-law, grandchildren, granddaughters-in-law, etc.), and accompanying guests were already standing at the gate, welcoming us with applause. The welcoming party stretched in a winding line from the gate to the innermost room. In accordance with Japanese custom, we took off our shoes and entered the house one by one, shaking hands and exchanging friendly greetings with the hosts.
    The host resided on a mountain, and the architecture and furnishings of the home were entirely in the old Japanese national style, extremely elegant and serene. The rooms were interconnected, each adorned with white gauze lanterns and covered with large red carpets. The hosts and accompanying guests were dressed in their national costumes, creating a lively atmosphere, as if celebrating a joyous occasion. Mr. Ichikawa Ennosuke, in order to receive us, had started construction two months prior, renovating and expanding the house to accommodate so many guests. It is said that more than sixty service staff were mobilized for the evening banquet.
    The banquet was held in a pavilion-style large living room. The red carpet inside the hall was filled with low round tables, eight people per table, with nearly two hundred guests and hosts seated on the floor. The host specially hired a famous Cantonese chef to prepare an extremely rich and exquisite Chinese feast for us.
    During the banquet, we could admire the scenery of the garden. By the time we took our seats, the sky had cleared,
  the setting sun reflected on the water, and red clouds filled the sky. Many long, beautiful colored ribbons, several feet in length, fluttered on the tall branches of the ancient pine and green bamboo outside the hall, setting off the lush green trees and red flowers in the garden, making it particularly beautiful.
    Mr. Ichikawa Ennosuke is sixty-nine years old this year, very healthy, and in particularly high spirits today. When he stood up to raise his glass and deliver a welcoming speech, his eyes were a little moist. He said with great emotion:
    "Last year I visited your country and gathered with my dear friends in Beijing. When we bid farewell to Beijing, we talked about 'parting temporarily for the joy of reunion.' Since that day, I have been looking forward to the day of reunion day and night. Sure enough, today I am able to meet everyone in Tokyo, in my home. I simply cannot describe how happy I am in my heart! I simply cannot express how grateful I am for the great joy that my friends have brought to me and my whole family!"
    "You have introduced Peking Opera, which has an excellent artistic tradition of China, to the Japanese people. Your performances have given the Japanese people great emotion, excitement and joy. Last year, when I performed Japanese Kabuki in China, I received a warm welcome from the Chinese people; and now the performance of the Chinese Peking Opera Troupe in Tokyo is also receiving a warm welcome from the Japanese people. This shows that the hearts of the Japanese and Chinese people are already connected. I believe that this is the best concrete achievement for Sino-Japanese friendship and world peace."
    Mr. Ichikawa Ennosuke, talking about this, pointed to the colored ribbons fluttering on the pine and bamboo, and said:
    "The colored ribbons hanging on the trees are called 'Tanabata ribbons'. Since ancient times, Japanese folklore has it that if you hang them on pine and bamboo trees and pray to the heavens, you will be able to realize your wish, just like the Cowherd and Weaver Girl meeting once a year. The meaning of hanging it up today is to commemorate our rare meeting this time, and to wish that our desire to meet each other year after year can be realized!"
    After the great applause of the whole audience died down, Mr. Ichikawa Ennosuke laughed unusually cheerfully. Mrs. Ennosuke whispered to me: "Mr. Ennosuke has rarely laughed so heartily. Since we left Beijing, he has really been looking forward to your coming day and night. These days, he has been so happy for your coming, for the success of your performance, that he hasn't slept well for several nights."
    Mr. Ennosuke smiled kindly as he concluded his speech:
    "Here again, I congratulate you on the success of your Tokyo performance, and once again express my heartfelt thanks for the warm welcome and brotherly treatment we received in China last year. Although I cannot repay even one ten-thousandth of the hospitality I received in China, I feel supremely happy to be able to invite you to my humble home today! Please spend this evening as happily as if you were in your own home without the slightest bit of courtesy."
    Then, Mr. Mei Lanfang raised his glass to bless the host's family and wished for the further development of cultural exchanges between China and Japan and the ever-deepening friendship between the Chinese and Japanese peoples.
    Mr. Ouyang Yuqian also raised his glass and said excitedly:
    "Last year, Mr. Ennosuke visited China, and today we are visiting Japan to perform. This will be recorded as an important page in the history of drama and cultural exchange between China and Japan. Such cultural exchanges between China and Japan are deepening day by day, which is a very good thing for the people of both countries and for all mankind. Today's gathering is a concentrated expression of the friendship between the artists and the people of China and Japan. Mr. Ennosuke's celebration with 'Tanabata' is quite poetic and meaningful. We firmly believe that sincere feelings cannot be blocked by the Milky Way!"
    Mr. Shiraishi Bon, associate chief writer of the editorial committee of Asahi Shimbun, and drama critics Mr. Hamamatsu Yonezo and Mr. Tobata Koji, were the first to applaud. Mr. Shiraishi Bon said: "This is really a good thing, Mr. Ouyang is absolutely right."
    During the banquet, Tsuruga Harukata performed the famous Japanese folk song "Ryushinuchi" in the garden to add to the fun. The singing was accompanied by the shamisen, which was extremely generous and tragic. Mr. Ichikawa Chusha said with emotion: "This is the voice of the oppressed people in ancient Japan, and also the voice of our nation."
    Mr. Ennosuke was extremely excited, left his seat and danced, personally performing the famous Japanese classical dance "Urashima" for the guests. His son, Ichikawa Danshiro, and his grandson, Ichikawa Danko, jointly performed an excerpt from the national song and dance drama "Hashi Benkei".
    After the program, the lights suddenly dimmed, with only a few sparse white gauze seated lanterns dimly lighting the flower path; at this time, laughter and chatter were heard in the garden. It turned out that the girls were releasing fireflies, as if countless green, glistening little pearls were scattered in the dark sky, twinkling and dancing. The white gauze seated lanterns illuminated the rain-soaked banana trees, holly trees, and ginkgo trees, making them emerald green. The firefly light swept across the bright red azalea bushes, making them extremely beautiful.
    Mrs. Ichikawa Ennosuke told us that these fireflies were specially collected by Mr. Ennosuke from Nagano Prefecture to welcome distinguished guests. Everyone watched the fireflies, ate tea, and chatted happily, and before we knew it, the night was already late.
    Mr. Mei said: "Although we know that the host is at peace when the guests leave, we always feel reluctant to part when we are with good friends."
    Mr. Ennosuke repeatedly said: "Talk more, thank you for coming, thank you for bringing happiness to my whole family."
    Mrs. Ennosuke gave each of the eighty-six guests a Japanese-style nightgown, specially made for the Chinese guests, each woven with delicate patterns using Ennosuke's name as a motif. The styles for men and women are different, and the way of wearing them is also different. Mrs. Ennosuke had the female guests put on the nightgowns, and she personally taught them how to wear them.
    The guests had already said good night to the host, but everyone sat down again.
    When we said goodbye to the host and came out, and the car had already gone far from the alley, we could still hear the hosts enthusiastically shouting "Goodbye!" - "Sayonara!"

    难忘的夜宴
    马少波
    在东京，中国访日京剧代表团的全体人员应日本著名表演艺术家市川猿之助先生的邀请，到他的家中出席了一次欢迎的夜宴。这一次友情绵绵、诗意无限的聚会，深深地铭刻在每个人的记忆之中。
    我们赴宴的时候，天还没有黑，但是微阴着。一路斜风细雨，很凉爽。到了，还没有下车，市川猿之助先生和他的夫人、家族（兄弟、弟妇、儿、女、儿妇、孙、孙妇等）、陪宾们早已站在家门鼓掌迎候了。欢迎的人从门外一直曲曲折折排到最深的内室。我们按照日本的习惯，依次地脱鞋进屋，和主人们亲切地握手言欢。
    主人依山而居，家园的建筑和陈设，完全是日本古老的民族风格，极其雅静幽美。每个屋子是相通的，间间都挂着白色的纱灯，铺着大红的地毡，主人们和陪宾们都穿起了自己民族的盛装，热热闹闹，好像办喜事。市川猿之助先生为了接待我们，在两个月以前就兴工改建房舍，扩大加宽，好容下这么多的客人。据说，这天的夜宴，服务人员就动员了六十多名。
    宴席设在一个亭榭式的大客厅，厅内的红毡上布满了矮圆桌，每八人一席，主宾近二百人，人们都席地坐着。主人特聘了广东名厨为我们治办极其丰盛精美的中国筵席。
    席间可以观赏庭园的景色。我们入席的时候，天已晴了，
  夕阳映水，红霞在天，大厅外侧的古松和青竹的高枝上飘着很多条长有数丈的美丽的彩带，迎风招展，衬着满园的绿树红花，分外好看。
    市川猿之助先生今年六十九岁了，身体很健壮，今天精神特别兴奋，在他站起来举杯致欢迎词的时候，眼睛有点湿润。他十分激动地说道：
    “去年我访问了贵国，在北京和亲爱的朋友们欢聚；在我们和北京告别的时候，曾谈到‘为了再相逢的喜悦，我们暂时分别’。自从那一天起，我日日夜夜盼望着相逢的日子。果然，今天能够在东京，在我的家里和大家见面，我简直无法形容我心里是多么高兴！我简直无法表达对于朋友们给我和我的全家带来的极大的快乐是如何地感谢！”
    “各位把中国具有优秀艺术传统的京剧介绍给日本人民，你们的表演，给予日本人民很大的感动、兴奋和欢喜。去年我在中国演出日本的歌舞伎时，受到中国人民的热烈欢迎；而现在中国京剧代表团在东京的演出，同样地受到日本人民热烈的欢迎，这表现着日、中两国人民的心已经连结在一起了。我相信，这是日中友好和世界和平的最好不过的具体成就。”
    市川猿之助先生谈到这里，指着松竹上飘着的彩带说：
    “树上挂着的彩带叫做‘七夕带’，自古以来，日本民间有这样的传说：在松树和竹子上挂了它，向天祈祷，就能够和天上的牛郎织女一年一度相会一样地实现自己的愿望。我今天挂起它的意思，是纪念我们今次难得的相会，并祝我们之间年年见面的愿望得以实现！”
    在全座的大鼓掌静下来之后，市川猿之助先生异常开朗地笑了，猿之助夫人低声地告诉我说：“猿之助先生很少这样痛快地笑过。我们自从离开北京，他真是日夜盼望着你们来，这些日子，他为了你们各位来，为了你们演出的成功，高兴得几个晚上没有睡好觉。”
    猿之助先生笑容可掬地在结束着他的讲话：
    “在这里再一次向各位祝贺东京演出的成功，并再一次对去年我们在中国受到热烈欢迎和兄弟般款待的事表示衷心的感谢。虽然我不能报答我在中国受到款待的万分之一，但今天能够请各位光临敝舍，我觉得无上地欣快！请各位像在自己家里一样一点不客气地快乐地度过今天的晚上。”
    接着，梅兰芳先生举杯为主人的全家祝福，并祝中日两国文化交流更加发展和中日人民友谊的日益深厚。
    欧阳予倩先生也举杯兴奋地说：
    “去年猿之助先生访问了中国，而今天我们到日本访问演出，这在中日两国的戏剧历史和文化交流的历史上将记下重要的一页。中日两国这样的文化交流一天比一天地加深起来，对两国人民，对整个人类都是很好的事情。今天的聚会是中日两国艺术家和两国人民的友谊的集中表现，猿之助先生以‘七夕’为祝，是颇有诗意的，是意味深长的，我们深信，真挚的感情不是银河可以阻挡得住的！”
    朝日新闻社社论委员会副主笔白石凡先生、戏剧评论家滨松米藏、户板康二先生首先鼓起掌来，白石凡先生说：“这真是好事，欧阳先生说的对极了。”
    席间，鹤贺治贺大夫在庭园中歌唱日本民间名曲“流新内”助兴，歌声配以三弦琴，极其慷慨悲凉。市川中车先生慨然说道：“这是日本古代被压迫人民的声音，也是我们民族的声音。”
    猿之助先生兴奋极了，离座起舞，亲自为客人表演了著名的日本古典舞“浦岛”。他的儿子市川段四郎和他的孙子市川团子合演了民族歌舞剧“桥弁庆”的一折。
    节目完毕，灯光忽然暗下来了，只有花径间疏疏的几盏白纱座灯烛光隐约；这时候，庭园中笑语声喧，原来女孩子们放起了萤火虫，好像在黑空中撒出了无数颗绿悠悠亮晶晶的小珍珠，闪闪飞舞。白纱座灯照得雨后的芭蕉、冬青、银杏树翠绿欲滴；萤火光掠过红艳艳的杜鹃花丛，美丽极了。
    市川猿之助夫人告诉我们，这些萤火虫是猿之助先生为了迎接佳宾，特地从长野县收集来的。大家一面看萤火，一面吃茶、欢谈，不觉夜已深了。
    梅先生说：“虽然我们懂得客去主安，却总觉得和好朋友在一起留恋难舍。”
    猿之助先生再三地讲：“多谈谈，感谢你们的来临，感谢你们给我全家带来了快乐。”
    猿之助夫人赠给了八十六位客人每人一件和式的寝衣，这是特为中国客人们制做的，每件都织着以猿之助的名字为图案的精致的花纹。男女的样式是不同的，穿着的方法也不一样，猿之助夫人让女客人把寝衣穿在身上，她亲自教会了穿着的方法。
    客人们本来已经向主人道过晚安了，但是大家又坐下来。
    当我们向主人告辞出来，车子已经出巷很远的时候，还听见主人们在门口热情地喊着“再见”！——“沙哟那拉”！
