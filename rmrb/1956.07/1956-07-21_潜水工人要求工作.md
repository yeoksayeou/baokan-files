    Divers Request Work
    We are a group of divers on the Baoji-Chengdu Railway. We have been with the No. 8 Team of the No. 2 Engineering Office of the No. 4 Bureau of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway for one year and two months. However, the actual time spent working is only four months, and we have no work to do for the rest of the time. We have repeatedly requested work from the superiors, but the leaders always say: "There is no work now, you can rest!" We are bored to death.
    Once, we saw a news item in the newspaper saying that the water gate of the water supply workshop of the Beijing Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant had a problem. In order to fix this problem, they specially bought diving suits, but because they could not find diving personnel, they still could not carry out the construction. At that time, we were very anxious. There was work there but no one to do it, while we were idle. We requested our superiors to volunteer to support the Beijing Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, but the person in charge here said: We are railways, they are factories, and we are not asked to support them. We really can't understand why we are still idle in today's hot socialist construction.
    Now the Baoji-Chengdu Railway has been completed. We request the superiors to transfer us to other new railway lines or other projects that require divers. Lin Wenfeng, Xu Mingzhen, and thirteen others

### 潜水工人要求工作

    潜水工人要求工作
    我们是宝成铁路上的一群潜水工人，自从来到宝成路四局二处八队，已经一年零两个月了。但是真正干工作的时间只有四个月，其余的时间都没有工作干。我们曾不止一次向上级要求分配工作，每次领导上总是说：“现在没有工作，你们休息吧！”闲的我们直发慌。
    有一次，我们在报上看到一则消息，说北京石景山钢铁厂给水车间的水闸出了毛病，他们为了整治这个毛病，专门买了潜水衣，但是因为找不到潜水人员，结果仍然没法施工。当时，我们很着急。那边有工作找不到人干，而我们却又闲起来。我们曾向上级提出要求志愿去支援北京石景山钢铁厂，但是，这里的负责人却说：我们是铁路，他们是工厂，不叫我们去支援。我们实在想不通，在到处火热地进行社会主义建设的今天，为什么还让我们闲着。
    现在宝成路已经完工了。我们要求上级把我们调到别的铁路新线或是其他需要潜水工的工程中去。林文峰、许明珍等十三人
