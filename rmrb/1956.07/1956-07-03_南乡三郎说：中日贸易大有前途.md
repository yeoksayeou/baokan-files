Xinhua News Agency, July 1st: Mr. Nango Saburo, Chairman of the Japan-China Export-Import Association, said that the future development of Sino-Japanese trade will exceed the pre-war scale.

Nango Saburo visited China in May of this year. Radio Japan broadcast his talk on June 28th. He said that this visit to China gave him unshakable confidence in his consistent ideals for Sino-Japanese trade, and also gave him some new insights. He has even brighter hopes for the future of Sino-Japanese trade.

Nango said that his ideal for Sino-Japanese trade is not satisfied with simply restoring the pre-war trade scale. He also believes that because China has completed its unification and established active economic policies, Sino-Japanese trade will definitely have greater development in the future and be able to exceed the pre-war scale. Nango listed the specific reasons for his view.

Nango Saburo also pointed out that, judging from the huge development potential of Sino-Japanese trade, the implementation rate of the Third Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement cannot be said to be satisfactory. He said that the reason why Sino-Japanese trade has not been fully developed so far is obviously due to international restrictions and the constraints of the embargo policy. Therefore, in order to make Sino-Japanese trade develop naturally and normally, these artificial obstacles should be broken down first. He expressed his belief that the international restrictions on Sino-Japanese trade will be completely abolished with the improvement of international relations.

Nango Saburo finally said that in order to cope with the fierce trade competition among countries around the world, Japan must establish stable trade relations based on international regions to avoid unfair competition and implement fair transactions. Nango called on members of the Japan-China Export-Import Association and the industrial community to work together and export high-quality goods at appropriate prices as the basic principle of transactions.

    南乡三郎说：中日贸易大有前途
    据新华社1日讯　日中输出入协会理事长南乡三郎说，中日贸易的今后发展将会超过战前的规模。
    南乡三郎曾经在今年五月间来中国访问。日本电台在六月二十八日广播了他的这个谈话。他说，这次访华旅行使他对于中日贸易的一贯理想有了不可动摇的自信，并且还有些新的心得。对于日中贸易的将来越发有了光明的希望。
    南乡说，他的对于日中贸易的理想，并不以恢复战前的贸易规模就认为满足。他还相信，因为中国已经完成统一大业和树立积极的经济政策，日中贸易今后一定会有更大的发展，而能超过战前的规模。南乡列举了他作如此看法的具体理由。
    南乡三郎同时指出，但是，从日中贸易的前途具有巨大发展的可能性来看，第三次中日贸易协定的履行比率不能不说是成绩欠佳的。他说，日中贸易到现在未能得到充分发展的原因，显然是受国际限制、禁运政策拘束的缘故。所以要想使日中贸易自然和正常的发展，就应当首先打破这些人为的障碍。他表示相信，日中贸易上所受的国际限制将随着国际关系的改善而被全部废除。
    南乡三郎最后说，日本为了对抗世界各国剧烈的贸易竞争，要根据国际地域建立安定的贸易关系，以避免不正当的竞争，实行公正的交易。南乡号召日中输出入协会的会员和产业界一致努力，用适当价格出口品质优良的商品，来做为交易的基本原则。
