    On the Elegant Beauty of the Lotus
    Huang Zongzhen
    The lotus flowers are in full bloom. When we admire them by the lotus pond, a fragrant and cool aroma wafts on the breeze, we cannot help but think of the lines from the Yuefu poem, "South of the Yangtze can pick lotus, lotus leaves are so lush and green," and other beautiful and refreshing verses praising the lotus; we think of Zhou Dunyi's "Ode to the Lotus." Since ancient times, the Chinese people have loved the lotus.
    The lotus, also called the lotus flower, is a perennial herbaceous plant that grows in water. It has beautiful green umbrella-shaped or round shield-shaped leaves, floating on or extending above the water surface. When it blooms in midsummer, each flower stalk bears only one flower, although occasionally there are two flowers, which we call "twin lotus flowers." In China, after thousands of years of cultivation, there are many precious varieties of lotus. Besides blooming with pure white flowers, there are also red or pink ones; besides the twin lotus, we have also cultivated the "pyramid lotus" with three flowers on one stem, and the "four-sided lotus" with four flowers, and even the "four-season lotus" that blooms all year round.
    Besides being ornamental, the lotus has many uses: the seeds, leaves, roots, petals, and seedpods all have value. In Li Shizhen's "Compendium of Materia Medica," it is explained that all the above organs can be used for medicinal purposes. Lotus seeds and roots are also delicious foods. The roots contain rich starch and can be used to make lotus root flour. Hangzhou's specialty, "West Lake Lotus Root Flour," is world-famous.
    A few years ago, the famous Soviet botanist, Academician Khristoforovich, specifically introduced a type of ancient Chinese lotus seed in the Soviet press. These precious lotus seeds were discovered in the peat soil layer of Pulandian, Liaoning Province, China. They had been dormant in the peat soil for about two hundred years. The Institute of Botany of the Chinese Academy of Sciences sent several of these ancient lotus seeds to the Leningrad Botanical Garden and the Moscow Main Botanical Garden of the Soviet Academy of Sciences. After special treatment and sowing by Soviet scientists, they actually sprouted, grew green lotus leaves, and blossomed last year. The ancient lotus seeds collected by the Beijing Botanical Garden of the Chinese Academy of Sciences also bloomed with lovely flowers after sowing.
    Why can lotus seeds retain their vitality after being buried in the peat soil layer for hundreds of years? This is because the outer pericarp of the lotus seed is hard and smooth, which can preserve it for a long time without being eroded. We first soak these "fossil"-like ancient lotus seeds in concentrated sulfuric acid for several hours to soften the hard pericarp, break the pericarp, and then soak them in clear water to allow moisture to penetrate the inside of the lotus seed, so that it can "rejuvenate."
    About fifteen hundred years ago, the famous agricultural book "Qi Min Yao Shu" recorded the methods of planting lotus roots and sowing lotus seeds. The book pointed out that the outer pericarp of lotus seeds is too hard, and it is best to grind the top of the lotus seed shell on a tile to make it soft and thin, so that the lotus seeds can easily germinate. Here we can also see the wisdom and creativity of the working people of ancient China. The ancient lotus seeds planted by the Beijing Botanical Garden of the Academy of Sciences have already bloomed.

    清香丽质说荷花
    黄宗甄
    荷花盛开了。当我们在荷花池畔欣赏它，微风吹来芬芳而沁凉的香气的时候，就不禁想起乐府中的“江南可采莲，莲叶何田田”，想到其他吟咏荷花的美妙清新的诗句；想到周敦颐的“爱莲说”。自古以来，我国人民就喜爱荷花了。
    荷花也叫做莲花，是生长在水中的多年生草本植物。有美丽的绿色的伞形或圆盾形的荷叶，飘浮在水面或伸出水面。在盛夏开花的时候，一枝花梗只开出一朵花，偶然也有开出两朵花的，我们把它叫做“并蒂莲”。荷花在我国经过千百年来长期的栽培，有很多名贵品种，除了开出洁白的花朵以外，还有红色的或粉红色的；除了并蒂莲，还培育出一蒂之上长出三朵荷花的“品字莲”和四朵花的“四面莲”，甚至一年四季开花的“四季莲”。
    荷花除了作为观赏以外，莲子、荷叶、藕、花瓣、莲蓬等，都有用处。在李时珍著的“本草纲目”中，说明了以上的各种器官，都能供作医药之用。莲子和藕更是可口的食品，藕中含有丰富的淀粉，可以用来制藕粉，杭州的特产“西湖藕粉”已是举世闻名的了。
    几年前，苏联著名的植物学家克里斯托佛维契通讯院士，曾在苏联的报刊上特地介绍了一种中国的古代莲子。这种珍贵的莲子是在我国辽宁普兰店的泥炭土地层中发现的，它们沉睡在泥炭土中当有二百年左右的历史了。中国科学院植物研究所曾送给苏联科学院列宁格勒植物园和莫斯科总植物园几颗这样的古代莲子，经过苏联科学家特别的处理方法而播种之后，居然发了芽，并且长出绿色的荷叶，到了去年都开花了。中国科学院北京植物园收集的这些出土的古代莲子，在播种之后，也开出可爱的花朵。
    为什么莲子能在泥炭土地层中埋藏了数百年，还能保持着生命力呢？这是因为莲子的外果皮坚硬而又光滑，能保藏长久而果皮不被剥蚀。我们把这些“化石”似的古代莲子，首先浸在浓硫酸中几小时，把坚硬的果皮浸软了，弄破果皮，然后浸在清水中，使水分浸透到莲子的内部，它就可以“返老还童”了。
    大约在一千五百年以前，著名的农书“齐民要术”曾记载着种藕和播种莲子的方法。这本书中指出了莲子的外果皮太坚硬，最好把莲子果壳的顶端在瓦上磨得柔软而稀薄，这样，莲子就容易发芽。在这里也可以看出祖国古代劳动人民的智慧和创造。科学院北京植物园种的古代莲子已经开花了。（附图片）
