Welcomed by All Nationalities
The Minority Nationalities Goods Store established by the Yunnan Provincial Trade Company in Kunming City sells more than a thousand kinds of goods with ethnic characteristics, including clothing, fabrics, shoes, socks, hats, gold and silver jewelry. The most popular items among the Dai, Tibetan, Jingpo, Lisu, Naxi, Miao, Yi, and Hani nationalities are black, yellow, and red satin, tableware knives, snuff bottles, silk flowers, as well as curved gold bars and various colors and sizes of Yuanzhu beads, bracelets, and earrings. Minority nationality representatives who come to Kunming for meetings or visits are willing to come to this store to buy some favorite items to take home. Representatives of the Yi and Sani nationalities from Guishan County bought all the more than two hundred strings of Yuanzhu beads of various colors sold in the store. The salesperson took out more than two hundred strings from the warehouse, and they were immediately bought up again. When the Frontier Minority Nationalities Delegation came to Kunming for a visit, several representatives bought more than two hundred braids of wide colored thread to take back to the girls in their agricultural cooperatives.

    少数民族商品门市部
    受到各族人民欢迎
    云南省贸易公司在昆明市设立的少数民族商品门市部，经营一千多种带有民族特点的服装，衣料、鞋袜、帽子、金银首饰等商品，其中最受傣、藏、景颇、傈僳、纳西、苗、彝、哈尼等族欢迎的是黑、黄、红色的缎子、餐刀、鼻烟壶、绢花以及弯金条和各种颜色大小不一的元珠、手镯、耳环等装饰品。来昆明开会或参观的少数民族代表，都愿到这个门市部来买些喜爱的东西带回家去。归山县的彝族和撒尼族的代表把门市部卖的二百多串各种颜色的元珠都买光了，售货员从仓库里又取出二百多串，一下又被他们买光了。边疆少数民族代表团来昆明参观，有几个代表买了二百多股宽花辫，带给他们农业合作社的姑娘。　（本报驻昆明记者）
