Silence! Stand Aside!
—Excerpts from the Minutes of a Meeting of the Editorial Department of a Certain Academic Journal Discussing the Implementation of the "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom" Policy
Xia Zun

Chairman: Today we want to discuss how to specifically implement the "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom" policy in the editorial work of our journal. This policy has extremely important historical significance, which can be explained in the following eight points: … In addition, four more points can be added: … Finally, a supplementary explanation of two points: … Now, I invite comrades to express their opinions.

(Silence for about five minutes.)

Chairman: Which comrade will start?

(Silence again for about two minutes.)

Chairman: Everyone, please feel free to talk! Let’s have some "contention" here first.

(Silence again for about one minute.)

Chairman: It seems we still need to ask. Comrade A, please speak first!

A: I am not prepared. Since the Chairman wants me to speak, I will share some superficial experiences, and please comrades correct me. I believe that the "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom" policy is completely correct. Because, first, … These five points are the most fundamental, and of course there are others, but I won’t discuss them for now. I also completely agree with the Chairman's analysis just now. The first point he mentioned, … In short, the eight points he analyzed, the four additional points, and the two supplementary points, I think are all very correct and should become the guiding ideology of our discussion this time. As for specific ways to implement this policy, I haven't considered it well yet, and I hope to hear valuable opinions from comrades.

B: I will also say a few words. I basically agree with Comrade A's opinion, … In addition, I would like to add two more points: …

C: I basically agree with the opinions of the above two comrades, … I also have two points to add: …

D: I would like to talk about it from the perspective of epistemology, …

E: I believe that the most important thing in discussing any issue is historical basis. Therefore, I would like to conduct some analysis from the perspective of Chinese history and world history, …

Chairman: Are there any other opinions? (Pause for about half a minute.) If there are no more opinions, then—

F: I have a small question. We are an academic journal, and we encounter issues related to academic viewpoints everywhere in our daily manuscript processing. However, in the past, the academic viewpoints of leading comrades often differed from those of our editors, resulting in differences in work opinions. Later, decisions were made according to the leaders' opinions, without any discussion. In the future, can we also "contend" on such issues within our department? Of course, issues related to policy must be subject to the higher authorities. What I am saying is, when differences in academic viewpoints are reflected in different opinions in specific work, can everyone "contend" a bit? "Everyone is equal before academics," and I hope that this sentence can be concretely realized.

G: I think Comrade F's question is worth discussing. My opinion is—

Chairman: Please slow down! I would like to remind everyone that the scope of our discussion is the issue of the academic community in society, not the work system or organizational discipline of the editorial department itself.

H: I think Comrade F completely misunderstood the meaning of "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom," and, from a principled point of view, it can even be said to be a distortion. …

I: I would like to remind Comrade F of one point: "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom" is carried out under the leadership of Marxism, not against Marxism. It is to further implement the Party's leadership over the "hundred schools," not to encourage the "hundred schools" to oppose the Party's leadership. …

J: … Therefore, I suggest that Comrade F should carefully understand the principle of democratic centralism and thoroughly examine his tendency towards lack of organization and discipline.

Chairman: Alright! It's almost time, let's stop here for now. Today's meeting was very good and yielded the following six valuable gains: First, … As for Comrade F, I believe that his motives are basically good, but he has great differences in understanding with us. However, with the strong help of comrades, I believe that we will eventually reach a consensus. The opinions that comrades gave to Comrade F today are a good start. I hope Comrade F will think about it carefully after the meeting and come to my office to talk tomorrow: Also, Comrade G originally wanted to express his opinion on the question raised by Comrade F, please come and talk together tomorrow! Now, the meeting is adjourned.

(Everyone disperses)

Chairman: Wait! Wait! Please wait a moment. I would like to announce something: After repeated study, I have now decided to return the manuscript from yesterday. Because it is too critical of Minister ×, although we advocate contention, the prestige of the leadership must still be considered.

    肃静回避
    ——某学术刊物编辑部讨论贯彻“百家争鸣”方针问题会议记录摘要
    夏　尊
    主席：今天我们要讨论的是，在我们刊物的编辑工作当中，怎样具体贯彻“百家争鸣”的方针的问题。这个方针，有着极其重大的历史意义，可以分以下八点来说明：……此外，还可以补充四点：……最后，附带说明两点：……现在，请同志们发表意见。
    （哑场约五分钟。）
    主席：哪位同志开个头吧！
    （哑场又约两分钟。）
    主席：大家随便谈吧！这里先来“争鸣”一下。
    （哑场又约一分钟。）
    主席：看来还是要请了。那就请甲同志先谈一谈吧！
    甲：我没有什么准备。主席要我谈，就谈一点粗浅的体会，请同志们指正。我认为，“百家争鸣”这个方针是完全正确的。因为，第一，……这五点是最基本的，其他当然还有，暂时不谈了。对于主席刚才的分析，我也完全同意。他说的第一点，……总之，他所分析的八点，和补充的四点，以及附带说明的两点，我认为都是非常正确的，应该成为我们这次讨论的指导思想。至于具体贯彻这个方针的办法，我还没有很好地考虑，希望听到同志们的宝贵意见。
    乙：我也来谈一下。我基本上同意甲同志的意见，……此外，再补充两点：……
    丙：对于以上两位同志的意见，我基本上都同意，……我也还有两点要补充：……
    丁：我想从认识论的角度来谈一谈，……戊：我认为，谈一切问题，最重要的是历史根据，因此，我想从中国史和世界史的角度来进行一些分析，……
    主席：还有什么意见没有？（停约半分钟。）如果没有什么意见了，那么——
    己：我还有一点小问题。我们是一个学术性的刊物，日常稿件处理当中，到处都会遇到有关学术观点的问题。可是，过去很多次，领导同志的学术观点和我们编辑同志有所不同，成为工作意见上的不同，后来都是按照领导的意见决定了，也没有经过什么讨论。今后，我们内部在这类问题上可不可以也“争鸣”一下呢？当然，有关政策的问题，是要服从上级的。我说的是，学术观点的不同反映在具体工作中意见的不同，这时是不是也可以大家“争”一下呢？“学术之前人人平等”，希望这句话能够具体实现。
    庚：我认为，己同志的问题，是值得讨论的。我的看法是——
    主席：请慢一点！我想提请注意：我们讨论的范围，是社会上学术界的问题，不是编辑部本身工作制度、组织纪律的问题。
    辛：我觉得，己同志根本误解了“百家争鸣”的意义，提到原则上看，甚至可以说是曲解。……
    壬：我想提请己同志注意一点：“百家争鸣”是在马克思主义领导之下进行的，不是反对马克思主义的。是为了进一步贯彻党对于“百家”的领导，不是鼓动“百家”来反对党的领导。……
    癸：……因此，我建议，己同志应该好好领会一下民主集中制的原则，彻底检查自己的无组织无纪律倾向。
    主席：好吧！时间差不多了，暂时到此为止。今天的会开得很好，有了下列六点可贵的收获：第一，……至于己同志，我相信他的动机基本上还是好的，不过在认识上和我们有着很大的分歧。但是，在同志们的大力帮助之下，我相信，终于还是会取得一致的。今天同志们对己同志所提的意见，便是一个良好的开端，希望己同志散会以后好好地考虑一下，明天再到我的办公室里来谈一谈：还有，庚同志本来要就己同志所提的问题发表意见的，明天也请一起来谈谈！现在，散会。
    （众走散）主席：喂！喂！请等一等。顺便通知一件事：昨天那篇稿子，经我再三研究，现在决定，还是退回不用。因为，它对于×部长批评得太尖锐一些了，虽说争鸣，领导威信还是不能不考虑的。
