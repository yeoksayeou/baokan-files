    Ending China's History of Inability to Manufacture Cars
    The First Batch of Domestically Produced Cars to be Trial-Assembled and Leave the Factory on July 15th

    (Our newspaper, Changchun, 5th dispatch) The first batch of domestically produced cars will be trial-assembled and leave the factory on July 15th. This was determined by the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant when arranging its tasks for the third quarter. Through this trial assembly, they will test whether the more than three thousand types of auto parts and various assembly components they have manufactured meet technical requirements, ensuring that cars can be mass-produced before October 1st. Currently, all the factory's employees are joyfully and enthusiastically redoubling their efforts, using their own hands to end China's backward history of being unable to manufacture its own cars.

    In order to produce cars as soon as possible, the employees of the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant completed the first half of the year's production plan a month ahead of schedule. Currently, over 90% of the auto parts have been adjusted, and more than a dozen major assembly components such as the car's engine, rear axle, front axle, and gearbox have also been successfully assembled. More than 21,000 types of tools for manufacturing auto parts have also been prepared.

    There are still some difficulties in manufacturing the first batch of cars in the third quarter. The main difficulties are the insufficient supply of automotive materials and collaborative products. Before officially starting production, there is still a shortage of more than eighty specifications of metal materials, and some collaborative products cannot meet the needs in terms of quantity. Employees of the factory's supply department are demonstrating their initiative and helping domestic contractor factories to jointly overcome technical difficulties.

    结束我国不能自制汽车的历史 
    首批国产汽车七月十五日试装出厂
    本报长春5日电　第一批国产汽车将在七月十五日试装出厂。这是第一汽车制造厂安排第三季度任务时所确定的。通过这次试装，他们将检验自己制造的三千多种汽车零件和各个总成部分是否合乎技术要求，保证十月一日以前能够大量生产汽车。现在，全厂职工正欢欣鼓舞地加倍努力，用自己的双手来结束我国不能自己制造汽车的落后的历史。
    第一汽车制造厂职工为了早日生产汽车，曾经提前一个月完成了上半年的生产计划，目前， 90％以上的汽车零件已经调整好了，汽车的发动机、后桥、前轴、变速箱等十几个主要总成部分也已装配成功，制造汽车零件的各种工具也已准备好两万一千多种。
    在第三季度内制造出第一批汽车，目前还有一些困难。主要是汽车材料和协作产品供应不足，正式投入生产以前还缺少八十多种规格的金属材料，有些协作产品在数量上还不能满足需要，全厂供应部门职工正发挥主动精神，帮助国内各承制工厂共同克服技术方面的困难。
