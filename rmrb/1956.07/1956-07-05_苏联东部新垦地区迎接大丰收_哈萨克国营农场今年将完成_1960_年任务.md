    The new lands of Kazakhstan await a great harvest. According to Comrade Roki Z., Minister of State Farms of the Kazakh Republic, in a newspaper article: Crops on eighteen million hectares of new land have matured, and such a good harvest is unprecedented. This year, the state farms of the republic will harvest 600 million poods of grain, that is, they will be able to complete the grain production task stipulated for the state farms of the republic in the Sixth Five-Year Plan this year. At present, state farms are working intensely to organize the harvesting work. More than 32,000 combine harvesters and 50,000 trucks will participate in this harvest; however, manpower is still insufficient to harvest so many crops in a short period of time. At present, Soviet youth are preparing to use their vacation time to go to Kazakhstan and other places to help with the harvest.
    Xinhua News Agency, July 4th: According to a TASS report, the 337 new state grain farms established in the reclaimed areas of Kazakhstan in the past two years are rapidly developing animal husbandry.
    In the recent three or four years, the animal husbandry of the new state farms in the reclaimed areas of Kazakhstan will receive particularly rapid development. By the end of the new Five-Year Plan, the number of dairy cows on Kazakhstan's state farms will increase almost ninefold compared to this year, fine-wool and semi-fine-wool sheep will increase fourfold, and pigs will increase dozens of times.

    苏联东部新垦地区迎接大丰收
    哈萨克国营农场今年将完成1960年任务
    本报莫斯科4日电　一场大丰收在等待哈萨克斯坦新地上的人们。据哈萨克共和国国营农场部部长罗基?兹在报上说：一千八百万公顷新地上庄稼都已成熟，这样好的收成是空前未有的。今年共和国的国营农场将收获六亿普特粮食，即在今年就能完成了第六个五年计划所规定的共和国国营农场的谷物生产任务。目前国营农场在紧张地组织收割工作。在此次收割中，将有三万二千多台联合收割机和五万辆载重汽车参加工作；但在短时间内收割这许多庄稼，人力方面还是不够的。目前苏联青年准备利用到哈萨克斯坦和各地去休假的时间帮助收割工作。
    据新华社4日讯　据塔斯社报道：最近两年在哈萨克开垦地区新建立的三百三十七个国营谷物农场，正在迅速地发展畜牧业。
    在最近三、四年中，哈萨克开垦区的新国营农场的畜牧业，将得到特别迅速的发展。到新五年计划结束的时候，哈萨克国营农场的乳牛将差不多增加为今年的九倍，细毛羊和半细毛羊将增加到四倍，猪将增加几十倍。
