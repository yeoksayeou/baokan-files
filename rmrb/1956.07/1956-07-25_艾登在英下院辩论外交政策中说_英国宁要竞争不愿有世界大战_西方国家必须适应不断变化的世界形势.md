Xinhua News Agency, London, 24th: British Parliament's House of Commons held a foreign policy debate on the 23rd and 24th. Prime Minister Eden said that the danger of world war is diminishing. "I would rather have the threat of Soviet competition than the threat of world war."

Eden was the first to speak in the debate. He said that the foundation of British policy is to "maintain the closest possible relations with the Commonwealth, the United States, and Western Europe." He assured that Britain would not make sudden or abrupt decisions that would cause the entire Western military system to "fall into chaos." However, he demanded that Western countries must adapt to the ever-changing world in order to "enjoy the trust of the people."

Eden called for "patient diplomacy" from Western countries.

Eden once again emphasized the "deterrent power" of nuclear weapons, believing that people's understanding of this power "plays a strong role in maintaining peace today." He said that the fact that Britain will soon possess nuclear weapons will "force both sides of the Iron Curtain to make some military reconsiderations."

When talking about the German question and European security issues, Eden insisted on holding "free elections" in Germany, while avoiding talking about the preconditions for holding truly free elections under the current circumstances. He also said that at the appropriate time, the East and West could discuss further easing of tensions in Europe and the issue of mutually agreed restrictions on troops in certain areas. However, he said that these issues must be resolved simultaneously with the reunification of Germany.

Eden said that he hopes that all relevant parties, including the Soviet Union, will consider whether organizations such as the Western European Union and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization can formulate some plan to increase trust between East and West.

Eden concluded by saying that in the past two years, the international situation has undergone major changes, and now "there may be an opportunity to strengthen the greater trust upon which peace depends. In the years to come, British diplomacy must be dedicated to this."

The opposition Labour Party's foreign affairs spokesman, Robens, spoke next. He said that the Labour Party believes that China should be admitted to the United Nations because China is the key to the Far East. He accused the government of diminishing the importance of this issue and demanded that the government work to resolve this issue this fall. At the same time, Robens stated that the Labour Party continues to advocate the so-called "neutralization of Taiwan under the auspices of the United Nations," a measure that the Chinese people can never tolerate.

When talking about the Middle East issue, Robens specifically criticized the Baghdad Pact. He also believed that providing economic assistance through military treaties and alliances is a major mistake. He advocated providing economic assistance to the Middle East through the United Nations, and also advocated the establishment of an organization like the Colombo Plan in the Middle East. At the same time, he also advocated further shipments of arms to Israel.

When talking about the German question, Robens demanded that the four countries of Britain, the United States, France, and West Germany hold a unilateral meeting to find a way to deal with this issue. He worried that the Soviet Union might win in the "psychological warfare" on the German question.

Liberal Party leader Davis mentioned the easing of tensions in his speech, believing that this would inevitably lead to Britain significantly reducing military spending.

The debate continued on the 24th.

    艾登在英下院辩论外交政策中说
    英国宁要竞争不愿有世界大战
    西方国家必须适应不断变化的世界形势
    新华社24日讯　伦敦消息：英国议会下院在二十三日和二十四日举行外交政策辩论。艾登首相说，世界大战的危险正在减退。“我宁愿要苏联竞争的威胁，而不愿意有世界大战的威胁。”
    艾登是在辩论中第一个发言的。他说，英国政策的基础是“仍然牢固地同英联邦、美国和西欧保持尽可能密切的关系”。他保证英国不会作出突然的或者唐突的决定，以致使西方整个军事体系“陷入混乱”。不过，他要求西方国家必须适应不断变化的世界，以便“享有人民的信任”。
    艾登要求西方国家进行“耐心的外交活动”。
    艾登再一次强调核子武器的“威慑力量”，认为人们对这种力量的了解“在今天对保持和平起了有力的作用”。他说，英国不久也要拥有核子武器的这个事实，将“迫使铁幕两边重新作一些军事上的考虑。”
    在谈到德国问题和欧洲安全问题的时候，艾登坚持在德国举行“自由选举”，同时却避而不谈在目前情况下举行真正的自由选举的先决条件。他还说，在适当时机，东西方之间可以讨论进一步缓和欧洲紧张局势问题和对某些地区的部队进行一致同意的限制的问题。不过，他说，这些问题必须同德国重新统一问题同时解决。
    艾登说，他希望包括苏联在内的所有有关方面考虑一下，是不是可以使西欧联盟和北大西洋集团这类组织制订出增加东西方之间的信任的某种计划。
    艾登最后说，两年来，国际局面已经发生了重大的改变，现在
  “可能有机会来加强和平所赖的更大的信任。在今后若干年月中，英国的外交一定致力于这一点。”
    反对党工党外交事务方面的发言人罗本斯接着发言。他说，工党认为应该接纳中国进入联合国，因为中国是远东的关键。他指责政府缩小了这个问题的重要性，并且要求政府在今年秋天努力促使这个问题获得解决。同时，罗本斯表明，工党继续主张采取所谓“在联合国主持下让台湾中立化”这种中国人民决不能容忍的措施。
    罗本斯在谈到中东问题的时候，特别批评了巴格达条约。他还认为，通过军事条约和同盟提供经济援助是一种重大的错误。他主张通过联合国向中东提供经济援助，也主张在中东成立一个像科伦坡计划那样的机构。他同时又主张进一步运送军火给以色列。
    罗本斯在谈到德国问题的时候，要求英、美、法、西德四国举行片面会议，来寻求处理这个问题的方法。他担心苏联可能在德国问题上的“心理战”中获胜。
    自由党领袖戴维斯在发言的时候，提到紧张局势的缓和，认为这必然会使英国大大削减军费。
    辩论在二十四日继续进行。
