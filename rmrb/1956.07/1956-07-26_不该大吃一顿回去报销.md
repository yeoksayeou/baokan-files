    Shouldn't Have Had a Lavish Meal and Reimbursed It
    Editor:
        On the afternoon of July 10th, I went to the Jincheng Dining Hall on Ziqiang Road in Lanzhou for a meal. In this restaurant, I encountered a cadre from the Xuzhou Public Security Bureau. This comrade brought his own bottle of wine and ordered two dishes. The meal cost a total of 2.07 yuan (excluding the cost of the wine). After he finished eating and drinking, a lot of rice, dishes, and soup were left over. He pushed the leftovers to the edge of the table and shouted, with an air of importance, "Hey! Give me an invoice so I can get reimbursed." Only then did I realize that he was squandering public money.
        I think that some organizations, in order to take care of comrades on business trips, allow them to be reimbursed for actual expenses in individual areas with higher prices. However, the phenomenon of using public money to show off wealth and waste food must be strictly stopped.

### 不该大吃一顿回去报销

    不该大吃一顿回去报销 编辑同志：
    七月十日下午，我到兰州市自强路金城食堂去吃饭，在这家饭馆里碰到一位来自徐州市公安局的干部，这位同志自己带了一瓶酒，又叫了两个菜，这一顿饭共花了两元零七分钱（酒钱未计算）。他吃喝完毕后，饭、菜、汤剩了很多。他把剩饭、剩菜往桌边一推，神气十足地喊到，“来！给我开一张发票回去好报销”。这时我才恍然大悟，他原来是拿着公家的钱在挥霍。
    我觉得有些机关为了照顾出差的同志，允许他们在个别物价较高的地区吃饭可以实报实销，但是，必须对用公家的钱来摆阔气、浪费粮食的现象，严加制止。　王达
