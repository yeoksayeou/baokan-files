    The headquarters of all committees of the China Association for Promoting Democracy held a forum on July 22 to discuss the policy of long-term coexistence and mutual supervision. Feng Bin fu, Yan Jingyao, Lei Jieqiong, Wu Renyin, Gu Junzheng, Yang Zhonglan, Fan Zhifu, Cheng Hansan and others spoke at the meeting. Everyone unanimously supported the policy put forward by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, believing that this policy is in line with China's special historical situation and social conditions. The proposal of this policy not only gives the members of the democratic parties great encouragement, enabling everyone to better exert their enthusiasm and serve socialism; but also shows that the future tasks of the democratic parties are even more important, and they must greatly strengthen their work, closely contact the masses, and develop the organization.
    Regarding how to implement the policy of long-term coexistence and mutual supervision in the future, everyone expressed many opinions. Ni Zhihuang said: To implement this policy, it is necessary to comprehensively examine the United Front work and improve everyone's policy thinking; both party members and non-party members must have an attitude of neither arrogance nor inferiority, and learn from each other; the democratic parties must boldly reflect opinions from all sides. Wu Baosan said: To implement this policy, it is not only necessary to make this policy known to all parties, but also to have concrete measures. There are the CPPCC and the National People's Congress at the central and local levels to facilitate the exchange of opinions. Each unit should also have a corresponding organizational form or establish certain systems to ensure that mutual supervision is carried out regularly. Ma Keqiang said: The proposal of the policy of long-term coexistence and mutual supervision shows the Party's respect and trust for the democratic parties. We must strengthen the organization and strengthen ideological work, and not disappoint the Party's expectations of us. An Shaoyun said: For mutual supervision, we must first strictly demand ourselves, and at the same time, the Party also has the responsibility to create conditions for the democratic parties to carry out supervision. Wu Renyin said: Not only should the Party and the democratic parties supervise each other, but also the democratic parties should supervise each other; supervision is not hostile, but to be true friends.

    中国民主促进会总部各委员会
    座谈长期共存互相监督的方针
    本报讯　中国民主促进会总部各委员会于七月二十二日举行座谈会，讨论长期共存互相监督的方针。冯宾符、严景耀、雷洁琼、吴研因、顾均正、杨仲兰、范至甫、成汉三等都在会上发言。大家一致拥护中共中央提出这个方针，认为这个方针是合乎我国特殊的历史情况和社会条件的。这个方针的提出，不但给予民主党派成员以巨大的鼓舞，使大家更能发挥积极性，为社会主义服务；而且说明民主党派今后的任务更加重大，必须大大加强工作，密切联系群众，发展组织。
    今后如何贯彻长期共存互相监督的方针，大家发表了许多意见。倪之璜说：要贯彻这个方针，必须全面检查统一战线工作，提高大家的政策思想；不论党与非党都要有不骄不卑的态度，互相切磋琢磨；民主党派要大胆反映各方面的意见。巫宝三说：贯彻这一方针，不仅要使这一方针被各方面认识，而且还要有具体措施，在中央和地方有政协和人民代表大会，便于交换意见，在各个单位也应有相当的组织形式或订立一定的制度，保证互相监督经常进行。马克强说：长期共存互相监督这个方针的提出，就表明党对民主党派的尊重和信任，我们要加强组织，加强思想工作，不要辜负党对我们的期望。安绍云说：互相监督，首先要严格要求自己，同时党也有责任为民主党派进行监督创造条件。吴研因说：不仅党和民主党派要互相监督，各民主党派之间也要互相监督；监督不是敌对的，而是做真正的朋友。
