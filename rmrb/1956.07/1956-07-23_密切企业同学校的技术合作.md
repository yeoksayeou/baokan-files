    Closely Integrate Technical Cooperation Between Enterprises and Schools
    Gan Bai, Director of the Technology Department of the First Ministry of Machine Building

    In recent years, the technical cooperation between enterprises and schools has become increasingly close, which has benefited us both immensely. Taking the enterprises under my ministry as an example, the technological progress and production achievements made in recent years are inseparable from the close cooperation with universities and secondary technical schools. Schools have provided us with a large number of technical personnel. Today, the chief designers, chief process engineers, chief metallurgists, chief equipment and power engineers, and workshop directors in factories are mostly university graduates after liberation. Many university professors have written many papers and lecture notes in combination with the actual needs of enterprise production. Schools have established night universities, technical training courses, correspondence schools, and enrolled auditors, which have greatly helped enterprise cadres improve their technical theory. In addition, many students participated in practical work during their factory internships, helping enterprises solve many technical problems in production. When students from Zhejiang University were doing their graduation design at Hangzhou Universal Machine Factory, they helped the factory design and formulate dozens of sets of jigs, tools, and process cards. Harbin Institute of Technology helped Harbin Measuring & Cutting Tool Factory solve the problem of high-speed steel quenching. Lecturers from Harbin Institute of Technology also assisted Dalian Crane Factory in improving a welding rod formulation, bringing it up to Soviet standards. Enterprises have also provided schools with a lot of assistance, such as providing technical data and drawings, guiding student internships, enterprise engineers serving as lecturers in schools, participating in graduation internship defenses, and providing material assistance, and so on.

    At present, the main shortcomings in the cooperation between enterprises and schools are: the scope of cooperation is not wide enough, there is more cooperation in school internships and technical experiments, and less work is done in special research; the cooperation is still in a spontaneous state, lacking strong organizational leadership, and lacking a unified, overall, long-term plan; generally speaking, schools proactively request cooperation from enterprises more often, while enterprises proactively request cooperation from schools less often. In addition, there is a lack of a reasonable set of rules and regulations. For example, the rights and obligations of both parties, the procedures for exchanging technical data, the reward system, and remuneration have not been detailed. Neither enterprises nor schools have dedicated organizations and personnel to manage technical cooperation, so they cannot systematically carry out work and accumulate experience.

    The Party calls on us to strive to advance towards science and strive to reach the world's advanced level in technology within twelve years. This requires enterprises and schools to unite and organize their technical forces and further close cooperation. At present, schools urgently need to improve the quality of education and strengthen the combination of theory and practice. Enterprises, on the other hand, not only need to build new factories but also to transform old factories, to fully exploit the potential of enterprises, to trial-produce more new products, and to continuously improve product quality and reduce product costs. It is very difficult for enterprises to complete this task with their current technical strength, so they urgently need the assistance of scientific research institutions, especially universities.

    Judging from the past technical cooperation between enterprises and schools, I think that to do this work well in the future, we should pay attention to solving the following two problems:

    First, it is necessary to solve the problem of mutual understanding between the two parties. Our goal—building socialism—is consistent, but we often encounter some contradictions in cooperation. For example, in order to complete production or construction tasks, enterprises often require schools to specifically solve some current practical problems within a limited time; while schools, in order to complete teaching tasks, often focus on improving theoretical knowledge and require access to fresh and systematic technical problems. In student internships, enterprises often encounter some difficulties in terms of student accommodation, office space, and guidance coordination. In the past, we often exaggerated the contradictions and difficulties and ignored the dominant aspects of cooperation and mutual benefit. Some comrades do not have enough understanding of the teaching quality of universities and secondary technical schools after liberation, and they underestimate the abilities of teachers and students. They feel that students coming to factories for internships is adding trouble, and they think that the interns are young and immature and cannot solve any problems. Therefore, they sometimes adopt a perfunctory attitude in cooperation. This wrong thinking is very harmful to fostering good cooperative relationships. To overcome this thinking, enterprise leaders, such as Party committee secretaries, factory directors, chief engineers, education section chiefs, and general affairs section chiefs, must establish a clear sense of collectivism and educate workshop cadres through them. Nanjing Machine Tool Factory has done a very good job in this regard. After the interns arrive at the factory, the responsible comrades of the factory explain the complementary relationship between schools and enterprises, the significance of student internships, how the two parties should combine, and the responsibilities of relevant departments and workshops to all employees. Schools and enterprises both announce their plans for cooperation. In daily work, the chief engineer promptly checks the guidance work for the interns, commends the good ones, criticizes the bad ones, and pays attention to correcting deviations in the work in a timely manner.

    Secondly, we must strengthen the direct contact between enterprises and schools so as to understand each other and exchange technical information and data. Some inappropriate confidentiality systems in the past can be considered for cancellation. Both parties can jointly organize special personnel to revise the past confidentiality system and methods of exchanging data to simplify procedures.

    Now both parties are carrying out long-term planning, and they also have to make annual plans. Therefore, both parties can take this opportunity to put forward cooperation requests, which can be summarized by the competent departments, planned as a whole, and the research topics can be determined. This can reduce blindness and avoid duplicate topics and waste of resources.

    The work of technical cooperation between enterprises and schools is complicated, and it is best to establish a dedicated management organization or assign a dedicated person to be responsible for this work. It is recommended that the responsible comrades of the Industrial Education Department of the Higher Education Ministry, the Industrial Education Department and the Technology Department of the First Ministry of Machine Building maintain close contact and jointly discuss issues related to mutual assistance and cooperation. The three departments should assign full-time personnel to manage this work. To facilitate contact, enterprises and schools (including scientific research institutions) in the same region can establish a direct and fixed cooperative relationship, and the main technical leaders of both parties can serve as consultants or members of the technical committee of the other party.

    密切企业同学校的技术合作
    第一机械工业部技术司司长　甘柏
    几年来，企业同学校在科学技术方面的合作日益密切，使我们彼此都感到受益不浅。拿我部所属各企业来说，这几年来在技术方面的进步和在生产方面所取得的成绩，是同高等学校和中等技术学校的密切合作分不开的。学校给我们输送了大批技术人员，现在工厂里的总设计师、总工艺师、总锻冶师、总设备动力师和车间主任等大多是解放后的大学毕业生。许多大学教授结合企业生产的实际需要编写了不少论文和讲义。学校附设了夜大学、技术训练班、函授学校并招收旁听生，这些都给企业干部在技术理论方面的提高以极大帮助。另外，很多学生在工厂实习期间，参加实际工作，帮助企业解决了不少生产上的技术问题。浙江大学学生在杭州通用机器厂做毕业设计的时候，帮助工厂设计和制定了几十套卡具、刀具和工艺卡片。哈尔滨工业大学帮助哈尔滨量具刃具厂解决了高速钢淬火的问题。哈尔滨工业大学的讲师还曾协助大连起重机厂改进一种焊条的配制方法，使它达到苏联标准。在企业方面也给了学校不少帮助，如供给学校技术资料和图纸，指导学生实习，企业工程师担任学校的讲师，参加毕业实习答辩以及在物质上给予援助，等等。
    目前，企业和学校在合作方面的主要缺点是：合作的面不广，在学校实习和技术试验方面的合作多，在专题研究方面做得比较少；合作还处于自发状态，缺乏有力的组织领导，缺乏统一的全盘的长期规划；一般地说，学校主动要求企业合作的时候多，而企业主动要求学校的时候少。另外，还缺乏一套合理的章程制度。例如双方的权利义务，技术资料的交流手续、奖励制度、报酬等问题，都没有定出详细的办法。企业和学校双方也还没有专门的组织和人员来管理技术合作业务，因而不能有系统地进行工作和积累经验。
    党号召我们努力向科学进军，争取十二年内在技术方面达到世界先进水平，这就需要企业和学校把技术力量统一组织起来，进一步密切合作。目前，在学校方面，迫切要求提高教育质量，加强理论和实际的结合。在企业方面，不仅要建设新厂，还要改造老厂，要充分发挥企业潜力，要试制更多的新产品，要不断提高产品质量和降低产品成本，以目前企业的技术力量，去完成这个任务，困难是很多的，因此更迫切要求科学研究机构，特别是高等学校的协助。
    从过去企业和学校在技术合作方面的情况看来，我认为今后要做好这项工作，应该注意解决以下两个问题：
    首先是要解决双方的认识问题。我们的目标——建设社会主义是一致的，但是在合作当中也常常碰到一些矛盾。如为了完成生产或建设任务，企业方面往往要求学校能够在限定时间内具体解决一些当前的实际问题；而学校为了完成教学任务，往往偏重于理论认识上的提高，要求接触新鲜的系统的技术问题。在学生实习中，企业对学生的住宿、办公和指导配合方面也常常碰到一些困难。过去，我们往往夸大了矛盾和困难方面，忽视了合作互利的主导方面。有些同志对解放后高等学校和中等技术学校的教学质量认识不足，对师生的能力也估计不足，感到学生到工厂来实习是增加麻烦，认为实习的学生年轻幼稚，解决不了什么问题。因此在合作当中有时就采取应付态度。这种错误的思想对搞好合作关系是非常有害的。要克服这种思想，企业领导人员，如党委书记、厂长、总工程师、教育科长、总务科长等必须树立明确的集体主义思想，并通过他们对车间干部进行教育。在这方面，南京机床厂做得很好。当实习生到厂以后，厂里的负责同志就将学校和企业的相辅相成关系，学生实习的意义，双方如何结合、有关科室、车间的责任等向全体职工作交代，学校和企业都公布自己在合作中的计划。在日常工作中，总工程师及时检查对实习生的辅导工作，表扬好的，批评坏的，并且注意及时纠正工作中的偏差。
    其次，要加强企业和学校双方的直接联系，以便互相了解，交换技术情报和技术资料。过去有些不适当的保密制度可以考虑取消。双方可以共同组织专人对过去的保密制度和交换资料的办法加以修正，以简化手续。
    现在双方都在进行长远规划，同时还要作出年度计划。因此，双方都可以乘这个机会提出合作的要求，通过主管部门加以汇总，通盘规划，确定研究题目，这样就可以减少盲目性和避免题目重复，浪费力量。
    企业和学校在技术合作方面的工作是繁杂的，最好能建立专门的管理机构，或确定专人负责这项工作。建议高等教育部工业教育司、第一机械工业部工业教育司和技术司的负责同志密切联系，共同商讨有关互助合作的问题。三个司要确定专职人员管理这项工作。为了便于联系，在同一地区的企业和学校
  （包括科学研究机构）可以建立直接的固定的合作关系，双方的主要技术负责人员可以兼任对方的顾问或技术委员会的委员。
