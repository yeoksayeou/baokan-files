Xinhua News Agency, July 8th. The Beijing Municipal Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang invited former Kuomintang military and political personnel among its members and contacts to a symposium on the liberation of Taiwan on July 3rd and 4th.

Li Peiji, former Minister of Personnel of the Kuomintang, Chairman of Henan Province, and current member of the Central Research Institute of Culture and History, said: "The Kuomintang military and political personnel in Taiwan are still living a humiliating life of dependence. As a person with a bit of patriotism, how can I not give it some thought? Don't miss this last opportunity, and turn back as soon as possible."

Qin Yizhi, former Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Kuomintang Eighth Army Group and current alternate member of the Central Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, said: "The Taiwan authorities should adhere to the principle of patriotism and family unity, and send representatives as soon as possible to negotiate the peaceful liberation of Taiwan, so as to realize the complete reunification of the motherland at an early date." Liu Chunling, former Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Kuomintang Seventeenth Army Group and current member of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, said: "The government's policy is lenient. The military and political personnel in Taiwan, as long as they suddenly realize their errors and stand on the banner of patriotism to make contributions to the peaceful liberation of Taiwan, can be granted treatment with no blame for past misdeeds. Not only can their lives and property be protected, but also their work can be arranged." Shen Ke, former Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Kuomintang Border Region of Jiangsu, Shandong, Henan and Anhui Provinces and current Commissioner of the Beijing Municipal People's Committee, said: "The so-called 'a wise man submits to circumstances.' The Taiwan authorities should see the current international situation clearly and stop harboring any illusions. It is time to accept the peace talks proposal, and they must not make repeated mistakes and willingly become sinners of the country and the nation." Liu Yaozhang, former Mayor of Beiping of the Kuomintang and current Director of the General Office of the Ministry of Water Resources, and others expressed in their speeches that they would contribute their efforts to the peaceful liberation of Taiwan through various means.

More than 70 people including Hou Jingru, Ding Guitang, Huang Yong, Feng Qinzhai, He Jihong, Wang Jiazhen, Zhang Qianhua, Wang Bofan, and Zhou Dai also attended the symposium.

Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, July 7th. Thirty social figures from Tianjin, at a symposium held today on the peaceful liberation of Taiwan, advised their old colleagues and relatives in Taiwan to make contributions to the peaceful liberation of Taiwan.

Lu Zhonglin, former Chairman of the Kuomintang Hebei Provincial Government and Minister of Military Service, and current member of the National Defense Commission, said: I sometimes think of my many friends in Taiwan, with whom I shared life and death, even in my dreams. Now that I am living a happy life, I can't help but think of these friends who are suffering in Taiwan even more. He urged them to return to the embrace of the motherland as soon as possible and make contributions to the peaceful liberation of Taiwan.

Also speaking at the symposium were Wu Siyu, former Director of the Bureau of Ceremonies of the Kuomintang Government and Director of the Nanjing Capital Police Department; Liu Yifei, former senior general of the Northeast Army and Chairman of the Kuomintang Chahar Provincial Government, and current member of the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference; Zhang Xueming, Zhang Xueliang's younger brother and current member of the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference; and Zhang Xiujing, former Chief Supervisor of Artillery of the Kuomintang Government, and seventeen others. Wu Siyu hoped that the military and political personnel in Taiwan would return to the mainland to visit their relatives and friends, so as to understand today's motherland. Zhang Xueming, when talking about Premier Zhou's speech on the liberation of Taiwan, said: The Communist Party's such selfless policy is unprecedented. He said that in the past, many friends in the Northeast Army showed patriotic thinking in the "September 18th" Incident and the Xi'an Incident in order to fight Japanese imperialism. Now Taiwan is occupied by American imperialism again, and he advised his old fellow villagers, colleagues, classmates and relatives in the Northeast who are in Taiwan to follow the patriotic enthusiasm of the past, turn back as soon as possible, and make contributions to the peaceful liberation of Taiwan. Liu Yifei advised his relatives and colleagues in Taiwan not to hesitate on the wrong path and not to lose this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

    表示努力争取和平解放台湾
    据新华社8日讯　中国国民党革命委员会北京市委员会在七月三日和四日邀集成员和联系人士中的前国民党军政人员座谈解放台湾问题。
    前国民党铨叙部长、河南省主席、现任中央文史馆员的李培基说：“台湾的国民党军政人员仍过着寄人篱下的屈辱日子。作为一个还有一点爱国心的人，能不有所考虑吗？切莫错过这最后的时机了，应从速回头。”
    前国民党第八兵团副总司令、现任中国国民党革命委员会中央候补委员的覃异之说：“台湾当局应当本爱国一家的原则，从速派代表前来商谈和平解放台湾问题，早日实现祖国的完全统一。”前国民党十七兵团副总司令、现任政协北京市委员会委员的刘春岭说：“政府的政策是宽大的。在台湾的军政人员，只要幡然悔悟，站到爱国主义的旗帜下来，为和平解放台湾立功，就可以获得既往不咎的待遇，不仅生命财产可以得到保障，工作也可以得到安排。”前国民党苏鲁豫皖边区副总司令、现任北京市人民委员会专员的沈克说：“所谓‘识时务者为俊杰’，台湾当局应看清当前的国际局势，不要再抱任何幻想。是接受和谈建议的时候了，不可一错再错，甘当国家民族的罪人。”前国民党北平市长、现任水利部办公厅主任的刘瑶章等在发言中表示要通过各种方式，为和平解放台湾贡献自己的力量。
    参加这次座谈会的还有侯镜如、丁贵堂、黄雍、冯钦哉、何基鸿、王家桢、张潜华、王伯范、周岱等七十余人。
    新华社天津7日讯　三十名天津市的社会人士，在今天举行的关于和平解放台湾的座谈会上，劝告他们在台湾的旧同事和亲友们为和平解放台湾立功。
    前国民党河北省政府主席、兵役部部长，现任国防委员会委员鹿锺麟说：我有时在梦寐中都想起我在台湾的很多过去生死患难的朋友。我今天过着幸福生活，就更不能不想起这些在台湾受苦的朋友们。他劝他们从速回到祖国怀抱里来，为和平解放台湾立功。
    在座谈会上发言的还有前国民党政府典礼局局长、南京首都警察厅厅长吴思豫，前东北军高级将领、国民党察哈尔省政府主席，现任政协天津市委员会委员刘翼飞，张学良的弟弟、现任政协天津市委员会委员张学铭、前国民党政府炮兵总监张修敬等十七人。吴思豫希望台湾军政人员回到大陆来看看亲友，从而了解今天的祖国。张学铭在谈到周总理发言中关于解放台湾的部分说：共产党这样一个大公无私的政策是史无前例的。他说过去东北军很多朋友在“九一八”和西安事变中为了打日本帝国主义都表现了爱国思想，现在台湾又被美帝国主义侵占，他劝告他的在台湾的东北旧同乡、同事、同学和亲友们一本过去爱国热忱，从速回头，为和平解放台湾立功。刘翼飞劝告他的在台湾的亲友和同事们不要徘徊歧路，不要失掉这个千载一时的良机。
