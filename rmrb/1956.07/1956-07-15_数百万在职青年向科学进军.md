Xinhua News Agency, 13th: Millions of working intellectual youth with junior high school education or above nationwide are actively marching towards science. Currently, the Communist Youth League committees of approximately forty provinces and cities have convened meetings to mobilize youth to advance towards science. Many intellectual youth have formulated or are in the process of formulating personal amateur study plans. In Jinan City, 90% of young teachers in various middle schools have made plans. In Anshan City, more than 80% of engineering and technical personnel in factories and mines have made plans.

Many young people have proposed in their amateur study plans to become experts proficient in their respective industries within the next few years. Li Yunfa, a young technician in Shenyang City, requested to improve to the level of designer by the end of 1956 and be able to independently carry out all stages of design work for a 110-kilovolt high-voltage laboratory. Some intellectual youth have also requested to strive to pass the associate doctorate degree in the next few years.

Veteran scientists and engineers are all enthusiastic to help and guide these young people. Wang Pingzhi, a veteran engineer of the Third Construction Engineering Company in Shenyang City, took the initiative to tutor young technicians in self-study, expressing his intention to impart his forty years of work experience to the young people without reservation. Li Nantian, an engineer from the Anhui Provincial Forestry Department, also proposed conditions such as guaranteed teaching and guaranteed inspection to ensure that the youth are taught well.

Party and League organizations and administrative departments in various places are actively taking various measures to create learning conditions for young people. The Party, League, and administration of the Anshan Metallurgical and Mining Design Institute jointly resolved the phenomenon of young people having too many meetings and concurrent positions, and improved learning conditions. Many League organizations have also cooperated with relevant departments to help young people organize study organizations such as amateur study research and self-study. At present, an increasing number of working intellectual youth in various places are actively participating in amateur study.

    数百万在职青年向科学进军
    据新华社13日讯　全国数百万具有初中以上文化程度的在职知识青年正在积极向科学进军。目前约有四十多个省、市的青年团团委召开了动员青年向科学进军的会议。很多知识青年都制订了或正在制订个人业余进修规划。济南市各中学青年教师中订了规划的占青年教师总数的90％。鞍山市厂矿中的工程技术人员中有80％以上订了规划。
    许多青年在业余进修规划中提出要在今后几年内使自己成为精通本行业务的专家。沈阳市青年技术员李云发要求在1956年底提高到设计师水平，能够独立进行110千伏特的高电压实验室的各阶段设计工作等。一部分知识青年还要求在今后几年内努力争取考上副博士学位。
    老科学家、工程师们都热心去帮助和指导这些青年。沈阳市第三建筑工程公司老工程师王聘之主动辅导青年技术人员自学，他表示要把自己四十多年的工作经验无保留地教给青年们。安徽省林业厅工程师李南田还提出包教、包检查等条件以保证把青年教好。
    各地许多党团组织和行政部门都积极采取各种措施为青年创造学习条件。鞍山冶金、矿山设计院的党、团和行政共同解决了青年会议多、兼职多的现象，并且改善了学习条件。不少团的组织还和有关部门配合，帮助青年组织了业余进修的研究和自学等学习组织。目前，各地在职知识青年中已经有越来越多的人积极参加业余学习。
