Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, July 25th – This year, the river valleys in the Jinsha River, Yalong River, and Anning River basins in southern Sichuan Province have begun to trial-plant subtropical crops in a planned manner. Currently, thousands of coffee seedlings, trial-planted in counties such as Huili, Miyi, and Ningnan, have grown to several inches and are thriving. Crops such as kapok, banana, and cocoa have either been trial-planted or are in the preparation stage for trial planting.

According to a preliminary survey by the Sichuan Provincial Department of Agriculture, the river valleys of the aforementioned three rivers are in a high-temperature, high-humidity region, suitable for the growth of subtropical crops. In the past, local farmers have sporadically trial-planted crops such as coffee, cocoa, and kapok with good harvests. Therefore, the Sichuan Provincial Department of Agriculture has initially decided to designate parts of eight counties, including Xichang, Huili, Huidong, Dechang, Miyi, and Ningnan, as subtropical crop areas, and is preparing to establish a subtropical crop experimental station in Miyi County soon to strengthen technical guidance for farmers trial-planting subtropical crops.

    四川南端可种亚热带作物
    新华社成都25日电　四川省南端的金沙江、雅砻江、安宁河流域的河谷地带，今年开始有计划地试种亚热带作物。目前，会理、米易、宁南等县试种的数千株咖啡苗，已高达数寸，生长良好。木棉、香蕉、可可等作物，有的已经试种，有的正在进行试种的准备工作。
    据四川省农业厅的初步调查，上述三条河流的河谷地带属于高温高湿地区，适宜亚热带作物的生长。过去，当地农民曾经零星试种过咖啡、可可、木棉等作物，收成不错。因此，四川省农业厅初步决定把西昌、会理、会东、德昌、米易、宁南等八个县的部分地区划为亚热带作物区，并且准备最近在米易县设立一个亚热带作物试验站，对农民试种亚热带作物加强技术指导。
