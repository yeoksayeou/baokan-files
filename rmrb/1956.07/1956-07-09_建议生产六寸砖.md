    Suggest Producing Six-Inch Bricks
    The bricks we currently use for building houses are all eight inches long. However, when building corners, doorways, and window frames, six-inch bricks are needed. It is necessary to break the whole brick to use it. Sometimes, if the breaking is not accurate, the whole brick is broken, which is a great waste.
    I suggest that brick factories produce some six-inch bricks in a certain proportion. This can save a lot of materials for the country, reduce the procedures for construction workers to break bricks, speed up the progress of the project, and ensure the quality of the project. (Yu Zhenzhou)

    建议生产六寸砖
    我们现在盖房子用的砖，都是八寸长。可是在砌筑墙角、门口、窗口的时候，需要用六寸砖，必须把整块砖打开来使用，有时打不准，就把整个砖打碎了，浪费很大。
    我建议砖瓦厂按一定比例，生产一些六寸砖。这样既可以为国家节约大量材料，又可以减少建筑工人打砖的手续，加快工程进度，保证工程质量。　（于振洲）
