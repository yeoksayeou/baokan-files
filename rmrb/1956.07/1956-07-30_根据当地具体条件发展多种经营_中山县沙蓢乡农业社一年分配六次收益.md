Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, July 27th: The Shalang Township Agricultural Production Cooperative in Zhongshan County, Guangdong Province, after recent arrangements during the summer harvest, has decided to distribute income six times a year. This decision has been welcomed by all cooperative members.

　　The Shalang Township Agricultural Cooperative relies on planned development of diversified operations to strive for multiple distributions. This cooperative is located in the fertile soil area of the Pearl River Delta, and in the past mainly cultivated rice. The cooperative leadership considered that if they only managed rice, they could only distribute income twice a year, in summer and autumn. Therefore, the cooperative decided to utilize the favorable conditions of the local crisscrossing rivers and streams to expand the management of some sideline production that requires less labor and has lighter labor intensity, such as raising ducks, fish, geese, chickens, and pigs. Currently, the cooperative has already managed 240 mu of fish ponds, raised more than 23,000 ducks and chickens, and more than 400 pigs.

　　After the summer planting, the entire cooperative will also convert more than 300 mu of highlands, which yielded very little when rice was grown in the past, to growing vegetables and sweet potatoes, and will also increase the raising of geese and fish. Around the autumn rice harvest, they will increase the raising of chickens and ducks again, and plant taro, ginger, gourds, and beans on more than 300 mu of highlands.

　　With this arrangement, there can be three income distributions from agriculture and sideline occupations in the second half of this year, plus the three distributions of early rice and sideline income in the first half of this year, resulting in six distributions throughout the year. The income of the cooperative members will be greatly increased.

    根据当地具体条件发展多种经营
    中山县沙蓢乡农业社一年分配六次收益
    新华社广州27日电　广东省中山县沙蓢乡农业生产合作社在最近的夏收期间经过安排，决定在一年中要分配六次收益，这个决定，受到了全体社员的欢迎。
    沙蓢乡农业社是依靠有计划地发展多种经营来争取多次分配的。这个社在珠江三角洲的肥田沃土区，过去主要种植水稻。社的领导上考虑到如果单纯经营水稻，一年只能在夏、秋季分配两次。因此，合作社便决定利用当地河溪纵横等有利条件，扩大经营一些需要劳动力较少、劳动强度轻的养鸭、鱼、鹅、鸡、猪等副业生产。目前，这个社已经经营了渔塘二四零亩，养了鸭、鸡二万三千多只和四百多头猪。
    夏种结束后，全社还要将三百多亩过去种水稻时很少收成的高地改种蔬菜、番薯，并且增养一批鹅和鱼；到水稻秋收前后将再增养一些鸡和鸭，再在三百多亩高地上种芋、姜、瓜、豆等作物。
    经过这样安排，在今年下半年便可以有农、副业的三次收益分配，加上今年上半年共三次的早稻和副业收入的分配，全年的分配就有六次。社员的收入将大大增加。
