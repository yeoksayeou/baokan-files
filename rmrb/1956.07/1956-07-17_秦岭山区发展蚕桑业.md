    Qinling Mountains Develop Sericulture
    According to Xinhua News Agency, the north and south mountainous areas of the Qinling Mountains in southeastern Gansu Province are vigorously developing sericulture production. This year, farmers in the Tianshui area have already raised 570 silkworms of the Jiangsu variety and will continue to raise autumn silkworms.
    The north and south mountainous areas of the Qinling Mountains in Gansu Province include parts of the Tianshui and Wudu areas. The climate here is mild and sunny with ample rainfall, making it suitable for developing sericulture. Gansu Province has planned this area as a sericulture production zone.
