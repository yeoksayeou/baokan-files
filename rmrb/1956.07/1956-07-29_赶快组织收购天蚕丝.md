    Quickly Organize the Purchase of Tussah Silk

    Tussah silk (farmers call it Camphor Silk) is a type of wild silk produced by silkworms in Rong County, Guangxi. Wherever camphor, maple, pear, and other trees grow, these silkworms naturally proliferate. Tussah silk is an important raw material for making fishing gear. Because this silk is strong and resilient, fishing nets made from it are not prone to expansion, contraction, or rot, and they do not cast shadows in the water, making them ideal for catching schools of fish. Before the War of Resistance Against Japan, many merchants went deep into the rural areas of Rong County to purchase Tussah silk at low prices and sell it abroad.

    In the years since liberation, Tussah silk in Rong County (and possibly other regions) has not received the attention it deserves. According to people at the Rong County Supply and Marketing Cooperative: "Currently, there is no purchase price set, and the higher authorities have not given us any purchase targets. The sales channels are unclear, so we cannot purchase it." The Rong County Trading Branch Company also refused to purchase this special product because "it is not within our purchasing scope." Some time ago, someone came to Rong County to investigate the situation of Tussah silk, but the investigator also believed that "the product is not abundant" and decided "not to purchase it for the time being." In this way, although many silkworms thrive in the rural areas of various townships, a sales channel for this special product has not been found for a long time.

    Producing Tussah silk is one of the ways for agricultural cooperatives to develop diversified economies by utilizing local materials. Now is the peak season for Tussah silk production. It is hoped that the state-owned commercial departments will immediately vigorously organize purchases and strengthen technical guidance so that farmers can quickly master the techniques of capturing and producing Tussah silk.

    赶快组织收购天蚕丝
    天蚕丝（农民叫作樟蚕丝）是广西容县所产的一种野生蚕吐的丝。凡有樟、枫、梨等树生长的地方，大都自然地繁生着这种蚕。天蚕丝是制造渔具的一种重要原料。因为这种丝韧度强，用它作成的渔网不易涨缩和腐烂，放入水中没有阴影，利于捕捉群鱼。在抗日战争前，很多商人深入容县农村用贱价收购天蚕丝运销国外。
    解放后几年来，容县的天蚕丝（可能不只容县一个地区）一直没有引起人们应有的重视。据容县供销联合社的人说：“目前还没有收购牌价，上级也没有给我们收购任务，销路不清，因此无法收购。”容县贸易支公司也以“不是我们的收购范围”而拒绝收购这一特产品。前些日子有人来容县调查过天蚕丝的情况，但是，调查的人也认为“产品不多”而决定“暂不收购”。就这样，尽管各乡的农村里繁生着很多天蚕，却长期找不到这个特产品的销路。
    生产天蚕丝是农业社就地取材发展多种经济的内容之一，现在正是天蚕丝盛产期，希望国营商业部门立即大力组织收购，并且加强技术指导，以便农民迅速掌握捕制天蚕丝的技术。　（庞永福）
