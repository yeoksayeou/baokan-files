    Sighing at the Gate of the Park
    Shameen, a famous scenic spot in Guangzhou, has a very beautiful Shameen Park, but unfortunately, visitors never have the opportunity to go in and play. From spring to June this year, the park has been refusing visitors on the grounds of maintaining the plants. At the end of June, the Southern Daily criticized the park, and they had no choice but to open the rusted park gate. However, a few days later, they locked the gate again under the pretext of the lawn needing to be treated for pests. In this midsummer season, more and more people come to Shameen to visit, but tourists can only crowd in front of the park gate and sigh at the gate of the park. One day, a tourist sighing at the gate of the park wrote a poem in despair: Spring is the time for maintenance, don't enter in summer and autumn when there are many insects, the stone benches are cold in the winter snow, when will I be able to visit the park? I hope Shameen Park will open its doors soon!

    望园兴叹
    广州有名的风景区沙面，有一座很美丽的沙面公园，可惜游客们总没有机会进去游玩。这个公园，从今年春天到六月，一直以保养草木为理由拒绝游人入园。六月底，南方日报对这个公园提出了批评，他们才不得已把已生了锈的园门打开了。可是，几天以后，又借口草地需要灭虫把园门锁上了。当此盛夏，各地来到沙面游玩的人越来越多，可是，游人们只能挤在公园门前望园兴叹。一日，一位望园兴叹的游客感慨之下，吟了一首诗：春天正是保养天，夏秋虫多莫入园，冬雪茫茫石凳冷，何日才能游公园。希望沙面公园快快打开大门吧！
