Xinhua News Agency, 11th – The Xi'an Branch of the Jiusan Society and the Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang recently convened over a hundred scientific workers, university professors, and social figures in Xi'an to discuss the issue of "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom."

Many scientific workers and professors stated during the discussions that "contention" would lead to a more comprehensive understanding and mastery of the laws of development in society and nature, linking theory with practice.

The discussions on how to conduct free discussions in future academic research were very lively. Guo Zuoguo, a professor at Northwest Medical College, said that in the past, the bias in medicine was: only Western medicine was allowed to "bloom," not Traditional Chinese Medicine; only authorities were allowed to "bloom," not ordinary people; only Pavlov's theories were discussed, not the theories of capitalist countries. Only by breaking down these obstacles can we broadly launch free discussions in academia. Zhang Hanshan, curator of the Shaanxi Provincial Research Institute of Culture and History, used the academic developments of the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods and the Northern and Southern Dynasties to illustrate the very important significance of launching free discussions for promoting the further development of China's science, culture, and art. Cheng Yuanzhen, a professor at Northwest University, said that the practical process of "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom" is also the process of ideological remoulding of the vast number of intellectuals. Through "contention," a correct outlook on life and the world can be established. Therefore, those who still hold idealist views can also "bloom" and explore the truth through "contention." Many professors also mentioned that "contention" is not "chaotic contention." After in-depth thinking, research, and practice on an issue, one can "bloom," but they also opposed the authoritative idea that one must have a "set" of ideas and become an "expert" before one can "bloom" in academia.

Through the discussion of the "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom" policy, many people were encouraged and inspired. Zhang Xiaoheng, a member of the Shaanxi Provincial Research Institute of Culture and History, said at the symposium that he has hundreds of thousands of volumes of books in his home, which in the past were only used for his own closed-door research. Now he is determined to lend these books out for everyone to use as academic research references.

    西安科学工作者等座谈“百家争鸣”
    据新华社11日讯　九三学社西安分社、中国国民党革命委员会陕西省委员会最近分别召集西安市一百多位科学工作者、高等学校教授和社会人士座谈“百家争鸣”问题。
    许多科学工作者和教授们在座谈中认为，通过“争鸣”，会更全面地认识和掌握社会和自然界的发展规律，使理论和实际联系起来。
    在讨论中，对今后学术研究中如何展开自由讨论的问题，讨论的十分热烈。西北医学院教授郭佐国说，过去医学方面的偏向是：只许西医鸣，不许中医鸣，只许权威鸣，不许一般人鸣；只讲巴甫洛夫学说，不提资本主义国家的学说。只有打破这些阻碍，才能在学术上广泛展开自由讨论。陕西省文史馆馆长张寒杉以春秋战国和南北朝的学术发展的情况，来说明展开自由讨论，对推动我国科学文化和艺术的进一步发展，具有非常重要的意义。西北大学教授程元斟说：“百家争鸣”的实践过程也就是广大知识分子思想改造的过程，通过“争鸣”可以树立正确的人生观和世界观，因此还存在唯心主义观点的人也同样可以“鸣”，从“争鸣”中去探索真理。许多教授还提到“争鸣”不是“乱鸣”，对问题经过深入思考、钻研和实践，就可以“鸣”，但是也反对要求在学术上先有“一套”，成了“家”才能“鸣”的权威思想。
    经过对“百家争鸣”方针的讨论，许多人受到了鼓舞和启发。陕西省文史馆馆员张筱衡在座谈会上说，他家里有几十万卷藏书，过去只供他一个人闭门研究，现在他决心把这些书借拿出来，供给大家作学术上研究参考。
