    Why Cover Their Noses and Pass By?
    We are a group of demobilized construction soldiers. On June 3rd, we took a train to Luoyang to accept new work assignments. On the train, we encountered some actors from the Wuhan People's Art Theatre who were going to Luoyang to perform. When these actors went to the dining car, they passed through our carriage back and forth. Some actors (especially the actresses) covered their noses and passed by when they saw us. When we arrived at the station, they got off the train and continued to make the gesture of covering their noses as they passed by the place where we were assembling.
    We feel that this behavior is not only an insult to us, but also incompatible with their identity. Since they show such disgust towards us soldiers from worker-peasant backgrounds, how can they serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers well? We hope that the Wuhan People's Art Theatre will strengthen the political and ideological education of these comrades.

    为什么要掩鼻而过
    我们是一群复员建设军人，六月三日我们乘火车赴洛阳接受新的工作任务，在车上遇到武汉市人民艺术剧院一部分赴洛阳演出的演员，这些演员去餐厅吃饭时，来回经过我们乘坐的车厢，有些演员（尤其是女演员）看见我们就掩鼻而过。到了车站，他们下了车，经过我们整理队伍的地方，还继续作出掩鼻的姿态。
    我们觉得这种举动，不仅对我们是一种侮辱，也和他们的身份不相容。他们既然对我们这些工农出身的兵表示如此厌恶，怎能很好地为工农兵服务呢？我们希望武汉市人民艺术剧院，对这些同志加强政治思想教育。
