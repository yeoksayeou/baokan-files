	Survey on Reading Habits
	The American Gallup Poll recently conducted a survey on the public's reading habits. The results showed that 57% of high school graduates and 26% of college graduates nationwide did not read a single book throughout the past year. When asked about the authors of twelve world-renowned books, such as "Leaves of Grass," "Gulliver's Travels," and "The Origin of Species," 9% of college graduates could not answer any of them, and 39% of college graduates could barely name three.
	The American Gallup Poll could not help but express regret when publishing these survey results.
	Over Fourteen Thousand Children Trafficked
	According to Kyodo News, a total of 14,291 children were trafficked by human traffickers in Japan last year, the majority of whom were girls. Those trafficked were mostly children from poor families and those with only some primary education.
	Among the trafficked girls, nearly 94% were reduced to prostitution or fell into other similar miserable lives.
	Racial Discrimination in Detroit
	In Detroit, USA, a Mr. Luce had only just moved into his new home when hundreds of neighbors gathered in front of his door, shouting and smashing windows with stones. At the same time, several people claiming to be representatives of the "Neighborhood Improvement Association" broke into Luce's house, investigated his situation, and forcibly demanded to buy the house, on the grounds that this white residential area did not welcome him because he was of mixed red and white race. As a result, Luce was forced to sell the house and move his entire family away. The landlord who sold the house to Luce also received warnings from racists.
	This incident forced even the American bourgeois magazine "Time" to admit that even the current South African Federation, where racial discrimination is rampant, would feel "ashamed" of such behavior.

    阅读习惯的调查
    美国盖洛普民意测验所，最近举行了一次对公众阅读习惯的调查，调查的结果：全国57％的高中毕业生和26％的大学毕业生，去年全年没有读过一本书。在回答“草叶集”、“格里佛游记”和“物种原始”等十二种世界名著的作者的问题时，9％的大学毕业生一个也答不出，39％的大学毕业生只能勉强答出三个。
    美国盖洛普民意测验所在发表这项调查结果时，也不能不表示遗憾。
    一万四千多儿童被贩卖
    据共同社报道，在去年，日本共有一万四千二百九十一个儿童被人口贩子贩卖，其中绝大部分是女童。被贩卖的都是贫苦家庭中的和只受过一些初级教育的孩子。
    在被贩卖的女童中，将近94％沦为娼妓或者堕入其他类似的悲惨生活中。
    种族歧视在底特律
    在美国的底特律城，一位卢斯先生刚迁入新居没有几天，就有数百名邻人聚在门前大肆喧嚷，并且用石块砸破窗户。同时，几个自称为“街邻改善协会”代表的人闯入卢斯家里，调查卢斯情况，并且强要收购这幢房子，理由是这个白人居民区不欢迎他，因为他是一个红、白人混血种。结果，卢斯被迫将住宅出让，全家迁走。出售房子给卢斯的房东也受到种族主义者的警告。
    这个事件使得美国资产阶级的“时代”周刊也只好承认说，就是目前种族歧视盛行的南非联邦，对这种行径也会感到“羞愧”。
