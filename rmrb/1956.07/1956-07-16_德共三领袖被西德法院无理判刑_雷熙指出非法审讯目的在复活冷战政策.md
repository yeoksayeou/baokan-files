Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, July 14th: Karlsruhe dispatch: Disregarding the protests of the German Communist Party and the opposition of the broad masses of the people, the West German Federal Constitutional Court sentenced three leaders of the German Communist Party – fighters for peace and democracy – to imprisonment on July 13th.

Lei Xi and Leidewin were each sentenced to three and a half years of imprisonment and deprived of civil rights for four years. Schellinger was sentenced to two years of imprisonment and deprived of civil rights for two years. The charges imposed on them were "preparing to commit treason" and "defaming the government."

This trial began on June 25th. It was unreasonably delayed for more than two years, during which Lei Xi and Leidewin were detained in prison.

After the sentencing, Lei Xi made a statement to the court, saying that the purpose of this instigated trial was to revive Cold War policies once again. This trial is in sharp conflict with the interests of the German people, and it is directly aimed at a party that, from its very beginning, has fought for peace, the freedom of the people, and for a strong and independent Germany.

Lei Xi said that the German Communist Party leaders were on trial because they fought against military treaties and conscription. These military treaties are unconstitutional, and all Social Democrats, trade union members, pacifists, neutralists, women, and mothers oppose these treaties along with the German Communists.

The West German Federal Constitutional Court tried a total of six German Communist leaders this time. In addition to the above three, Zaimke and Zeirner were declared released, and Fischer did not appear in court for trial.

    德共三领袖被西德法院无理判刑
    雷熙指出非法审讯目的在复活冷战政策
    新华社柏林14日电　卡尔斯卢厄消息：西德联邦宪法法院不顾德国共产党的抗议和广大人民的反对，在七月十三日判处和平和民主的战士——德国共产党三个领袖以徒刑。
    雷熙和莱德温各被判处三年半徒刑，褫夺公民权四年，谢林格被判处两年徒刑，褫夺公民权两年。硬加在他们头上的罪名是“准备进行叛国罪”和“诽谤政府罪”。
    这次审讯是从六月二十五日开始的。它被无理地拖延了两年多，雷熙和莱德温两人在这一段时间内一直被拘禁在狱中。
    雷熙在宣判后向法庭发表声明说，这次受人教唆的审讯的目的在于再一次复活冷战政策。这次审讯是同德国人民的利益尖锐地抵触的，它是直接地对付这样的一个政党，这个党从一开始成立起就为和平、人民的自由和为强盛、独立的德国而斗争。
    雷熙说，德国共产党领导人受审讯，是因为他们为反对军事条约和征兵而斗争。这些军事条约不符合宪法，所有社会民主党人、工会会员，非战主义者、中立主义者、妇女和母亲们都同德国共产党人一起反对这些条约。
    西德联邦宪法法院这次一共审讯六个德共领导人。除上述三人外，蔡姆克和蔡尔纳被宣布释放，费希一直没有出庭受审。
