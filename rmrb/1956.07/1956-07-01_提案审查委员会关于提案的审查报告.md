    Report of the Proposal Examination Committee on Proposals
　　(Passed at the Sixth Meeting of the Proposal Examination Committee on June 30, 1956)
    Li Xuefeng, Chairman of the Proposal Examination Committee of the Third Session of the First National People's Congress
    The Third Session of the First National People's Congress received 176 proposals from representatives. Among them, 27 are comprehensive (including political and legal, ethnic affairs, and overseas Chinese affairs), 53 are related to industry and transportation, 28 are related to agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and water conservancy, 14 are related to finance, banking, and trade, and 54 are related to science, culture, education, and health.
    The Proposal Examination Committee established five examination groups: comprehensive, industrial transportation, agriculture forestry and water conservancy, finance and trade, culture and health, etc. The groups studied the relevant proposals, put forward preliminary examination opinions, and the plenary meeting of the committee deliberated on each case and decided on the examination opinions. All the examination opinions were also discussed by the representatives groups, who expressed basic agreement. Individual dissenting opinions were re-discussed by the plenary meeting of the committee, and necessary revisions were made to the original examination opinions.
    The Proposal Examination Committee believes that many of the opinions in the proposals received at this meeting are in line with the current needs of the country and have feasible conditions; some have been included in the national plan or have already begun; some are being implemented and should be strengthened or inspected and improved; some need careful study or active creation of conditions; and some are of great value in scientific and technological research. All these opinions fully reflect the patriotic enthusiasm of the people of the whole country and their high confidence in building socialism in the great motherland, and have a positive role in completing and over fulfilling my country's first five-year plan for the development of the national economy ahead of schedule. Therefore, it is recommended that, except for the two cases that are not to be established, all proposals be submitted to the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, the State Council, and the Supreme People's Court for processing in accordance with the examination opinions, and a report on the processing situation be submitted at the next meeting.
    Now the "Examination Opinions on Proposals of the Third Session of the First National People's Congress" (draft) passed by the meeting of the Proposal Examination Committee is submitted to the Congress for deliberation.

    提案审查委员会关于提案的审查报告
　　（1956年6月30日提案审查委员会第六次会议通过） 
    第一届全国人民代表大会第三次会议  提案审查委员会主任委员  李雪峰
    第一届全国人民代表大会第三次会议收到代表提案176件。其中属于综合性的（包括政治法律、民族事务、华侨事务等方面）27件，属于工业、交通方面的53件，属于农业、林业、畜牧、水利方面的28件，属于财政、金融、贸易方面的14件，属于科学、文化、教育、卫生方面的54件。
    提案审查委员会设立了综合、工业交通、农林水利、财金贸易、文教卫生等5个审查组，分组研究有关的提案，提出初步审查意见，由委员会全体会议逐案审议，决定审查意见。所有审查意见，并且经过各代表组讨论，表示基本同意。个别的不同意见，又由委员会全体会议重加讨论，对原来的审查意见作了必要的修改。
    提案审查委员会认为：这次会议收到的提案中，很多意见是符合于国家当前需要的，而且也是具备着可行的条件的；有些是已经列入国家计划或者已经开始进行的；有些是正在实施，应该加强工作或者检查改进的；有些是需要周密研究或者积极创造条件的；有些是在科学和技术研究上极有价值的。所有这些意见，充分反映了全国人民的爱国热情和对于伟大祖国建设社会主义的高度信心，对于提前完成和超额完成我国发展国民经济第一个五年计划具有积极的作用。为此建议：除不予成立的两案外，把所有提案分别交给全国人民代表大会常务委员会、国务院和最高人民法院，依照审查意见进行处理，并且在下一次会议提出处理情况的报告。
    现在把提案审查委员会会议通过的“第一届全国人民代表大会第三次会议提案审查意见”（草案），提请大会审议。
