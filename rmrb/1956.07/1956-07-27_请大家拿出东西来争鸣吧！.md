    Let's all bring out our ideas and contend!
    I wholeheartedly support the policy of "Letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend." Many articles discussing the "Hundred Schools of Thought Contend" have already been published in newspapers and periodicals. Instead of constantly dwelling on discussing and talking about the contention, it would be better for everyone to actually bring out their ideas and contend. I cannot help but ask you and the writers to immediately consider: If we are talking about contention, let's contend! Let's do what we say! Otherwise, I am deeply afraid that it will inevitably be just like the analogy of the arrow that Chairman Mao spoke of: Everyone just keeps praising, "Good arrow! Good arrow!" but is always unwilling to let it fly. What meaning does that have? (Hong Yiran)

    请大家拿出东西来争鸣吧！
    对“百家争鸣”的方针，我是衷心拥护的。报刊上已发表了很多论百家争鸣的文章，与其老是停留在论争鸣、谈争鸣，不如大家实际拿出东西来鸣一番。我不能不请你们和作家们立刻考虑一下，说争鸣就争鸣起来吧！说到就做到吧！否则，我深恐难免不正如毛主席所说过的那个关于箭的譬喻：大家都只是连声赞曰：“好箭！好箭！”却老是不愿意放出去。这又有什么意义呢？　（洪毅然）
