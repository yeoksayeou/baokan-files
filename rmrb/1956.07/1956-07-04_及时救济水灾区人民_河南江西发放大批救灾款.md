    Timely Relief for People in Flood-stricken Areas
    Henan and Jiangxi Distribute Large Amounts of Disaster Relief Funds
    (Our Newspaper dispatch) By June 20th, Henan Province had already issued 420,000 yuan in production disaster relief loans to support farmers in disaster areas. Local banks have been making these loans in a timely manner. When the Fengzhao Bank branch in Mengjin County issued production disaster relief loans, it proactively contacted the supply and marketing cooperative to ensure that the disaster victims could purchase the necessary fertilizers, seeds, etc. in a timely manner after receiving the loans.
    (Our Newspaper dispatch) In mid-June, Jiangxi Province experienced continuous heavy rains, causing disasters in parts of the Nanchang, Shangrao, and Ji'an Special Districts, and the Gannan Administrative Region due to dike breaches, waterlogging, or flash floods. The Provincial People's Committee is concerned about the production and lives of the disaster-stricken masses and has recently allocated more than 200,000 yuan for relief to help severely affected people and impoverished households such as orphans, the elderly, the disabled, and young children to overcome difficulties and restore production.
