Xinhua News Agency, Liaocheng, 5th: In the Liaocheng Special District of Shandong Province, where wheat production increased by 20% compared to last year, agricultural production cooperatives have been distributing wheat to their members as they harvest. According to statistics from the Cooperation Department of the Liaocheng District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, among the 4,499 agricultural cooperatives in the district, with the exception of a few cooperatives that suffered reduced wheat production due to hailstorms, over 90% of the members in the remaining cooperatives have increased their income compared to last year.

In Yanggu, Shouzhang, Fanxian, Dong'a and other counties, the wheat acreage accounts for more than 50% of the cultivated land area. After deducting agricultural taxes, various production expenses, and various public accumulation funds within the cooperatives, all the remaining wheat was distributed to the members. As a result, 93% to 96% of the members increased their income, and the net income of more than half of the members increased by 30% to 50% compared to last year.

In Gaotang, Xiajin, Linqing and other counties, which are rich in cotton production, the wheat acreage accounts for only about 30% of the cultivated land area. According to the principle of deducting less and distributing more, the various deductions within these county's agricultural cooperatives were reduced from more than 40% last year to about 30%. Therefore, in the vast majority of cooperatives, about 90% of the members also increased their income.

During the distribution of wheat, agricultural cooperatives in various places also took care of some members whose income was reduced due to illness or missed work, trying their best to ensure that their income was no less than last year or reduced very little. As a result, this group of members has also generally improved their enthusiasm for labor.

    聊城专区绝大部分农业合作社
    90％以上社员在麦收中增加了收入
    新华社聊城5日电　小麦比去年增产两成的山东省聊城专区的农业生产合作社，在麦收中随打随分，已经把应该分给社员的小麦全部分给了社员。据中共聊城地委合作部统计，全区4，499个农业社中，除因遭受雹灾小麦减产的少数社以外，其余的社90％以上的社员都比去年增加了收入。
    阳谷、寿张、范县、东阿等县的小麦面积占耕地面积50％以上，这些县的农业社除社内扣留农业税、各种生产费用和社内各种公共积累以外，其余的都分给了社员，因此93％到96％的社员增加了收入，其中半数以上的社员纯收入比去年增加30％到50％以上。
    盛产棉花的高唐、夏津、临清等县，麦田面积仅占耕地面积30％左右。这些县的农业社根据少扣多分的精神，社内各种扣留由去年的40％以上减少到30％左右，因此，绝大部分社90％左右的社员也增加了收入。
    在小麦分配中，各地农业社对一部分因病误工收入减少较多的社员，还给予了照顾，尽量使他们的收入比去年不增不减或减收很少。因此，这一部分社员，也普遍提高了劳动积极性。
