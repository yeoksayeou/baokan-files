A Feature:

    The Soviet journal "Kommunist" published an article in its sixth issue this year by Bolgov entitled "On the Socialist Expanded Reproduction of Collective Farms," which criticized Stalin's arguments in his book "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR" regarding raising collective farm ownership to ownership by the whole people.
    Stalin pointed out: "In order to raise collective farm ownership to the level of ownership by the whole people, it is necessary to exclude the surplus products produced by collective farms from the commodity circulation system and include them in the product exchange system between state industry and collective farms. This is the essence of the matter." Bolgov disagrees with this argument, believing that this formula of Stalin's would lead to the conclusion that raising collective farm ownership to ownership by the whole people, and the accompanying change in socialist production relations to communist production relations, depends primarily on the conditions of exchange, rather than on production itself. However, as practice has shown, the change in the nature of ownership is primarily determined by the development of production.
    Bolgov believes that the basic way to raise collective farm ownership to ownership by the whole people is to continuously strengthen the role of ownership by the whole people in collective farm production. This mainly refers to further increasing the technical equipment of machine tractor stations, realizing the comprehensive mechanization and electrification of agricultural production, and establishing a unified national power system. Due to the vigorous strengthening of the role of ownership by the whole people in collective farms, the number of fixed workers in machine tractor stations and other state-owned enterprises serving collective farm production will increase. This means that an increasing proportion of collective farm products is produced by workers in enterprises owned by the whole people using means of production owned by the whole people. Therefore, in the huge growth of the total amount of collective farm production, the amount of products belonging to the state, that is, belonging to the whole people, will also increase. In this way, conditions have already been created in production itself, which will ultimately raise collective farm ownership to ownership by the whole people and eliminate the major differences between the working class and the collective farmers.

    关于提高集体农庄所有制成为全民所有制的新见解
    苏联“共产党人”杂志今年第六期发表了波尔果夫的一篇题为
  “论集体农庄的社会主义扩大再生产”的文章，其中批评了斯大林在
  “苏联社会主义经济问题”一书中所表述的关于提高集体农庄所有制为全民所有制的论点。
    斯大林曾指出：“为了把集体农庄所有制提高到全民所有制的水平，必须将集体农庄生产的剩余品从商品流通系统中排除出去、把它们列入国家工业和集体农庄间的产品交换系统中。问题的实质就在这里。”波尔果夫不同意这个论点，他认为，从斯大林的这个公式会得出这样的结论：提高集体农庄所有制为全民所有制，以及随之而来的改变社会主义生产关系成为共产主义生产关系，首先取决于交换条件，而不是取决于生产本身。但是，正如实践所表明，所有制性质的改变首先是由生产的发展来决定的。
    波尔果夫认为，提高集体农庄所有制为全民所有制的基本途径是，不断地加强集体农庄生产中全民所有制的作用。这主要是指进一步增加机器拖拉机站的技术设备，实现农业生产的综合机械化和电气化；建立全国统一的动力系统。由于大力加强全民所有制在集体农庄中的作用，在机器拖拉机站和其他为集体农庄生产服务的国营企业中的固定工人的人数将会增加。这就意味着集体农庄的产品在越来越大的程度上，是由全民所有的企业中的工人运用全民所有的生产资料生产出来的，因而在集体农庄生产的总量的巨大增长中，属于国家的，即属于全民的那一部分产品数量也将愈益增多。这样，在生产本身就已经创造了条件，这些条件归根结底将把集体农庄所有制提高为全民所有制，将消除工人阶级同集体农民之间的重大差别。
