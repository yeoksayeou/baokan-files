21　That afternoon, Li Baichuan, the director of the Second Cooperative, proposed at the Party branch committee meeting to keep only 3% of the public accumulation fund. All the branch committee members opposed it. Finally, it was decided to keep at least 5%, and the meeting adjourned.
22　Li Baichuan went home with a sullen face and flopped onto the kang. His wife hurriedly pushed the tobacco basket over to him. Li Baichuan reached for his tobacco pouch at his waist, but he had left it at the meeting. He shoved the tobacco basket away with a "whoosh."
23　His wife jumped in fright and quickly pulled a letter from the letters on the wall, tore it open, rolled it into a cigarette, and carefully handed it over. Li Baichuan suddenly slammed the kang mat and said resentfully, "Public accumulation fund, public accumulation fund! Using the members' money to buy an official position! Humph!"
24　Li Baichuan smoked, staring at the roof, venting his anger. His wife was like a mouse avoiding a cat, not daring to make a sound. Suddenly, a "poof" sound was heard outside the door, and a person came in with a "hee hee hee" laugh. Who do you think this person is? Just looking at his ghostly appearance tells you he's not a good person!

    21　这天下午，二社主任李百川在支委会提出只留公积金百分之三，全体支委都表示反对，最后决议至少要留百分之五，便散了会。
    22　李百川瘟头丧脸地回到家，咕咚往炕上一仰，他老婆忙把烟笸箩推过去，李百川伸手一摸腰里的烟袋，烟袋丢在会场上了，就把烟笸箩嗖的一搡。
    23　他老婆唬得一跳，连忙从墙上的信札里抽下个信封，拆开，卷成烟卷，小心地递过去。李百川忽然把炕席一砸，恨恨地说：“公积金，公积金！拿着社员的钱买官做！哼！”
    24　李百川抽着烟，瞪着屋顶发脾气。他老婆像避猫鼠似的，不敢作声。只听得风门外“噗嗤”一声，一个人“嘻嘻嘻”笑着进来了。你道这人是谁？看他鬼相就知不是好人！
