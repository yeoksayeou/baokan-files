Why are Shop Assistants' Working Hours So Long?
By our correspondent Liu Heng

In Baotou City, many female shop assistants are married. Among their husbands, there is a saying: "Don't marry a shop assistant!"

The reason is that shop assistants' working hours are too long. They have to attend meetings six or seven times a week. Besides meetings, they have to work about ten hours a day and often don't get home until midnight. The husbands have to take care of the children after work and wait to open the door for their wives. If the wife is timid and afraid of walking at night, the husband has to get up in the middle of the night and go outside to pick her up.

Why are shop assistants' working hours so long?

Some leaders say, "This is because we don't have enough staff." Indeed, since the preparation and construction of the Baotou industrial base began in 1953, the population has been increasing day by day, and various industries have not been able to keep up. There is an urgent need for strong support from all over the country. However, is it necessary to use the method of "extending working hours" to solve the problem of insufficient staff? No! Take the Baotou State-owned store as an example. Because shop assistants often don't get enough rest, the number of sick people increases month by month. In one month, 464 people went to the hospital for treatment. This makes the staff even shorter.

Some leaders say, "Shop assistants work long hours because many of them have low levels of education." Indeed, some shop assistants have low levels of education, and they spend a long time reconciling accounts every day, which prolongs their working hours. However, if their education level is low, it should be improved, and the leadership should give them time to improve their education. According to statistics, shop assistants have the most absences from many vocational and amateur cultural schools in Baotou City. This makes it even more difficult for shop assistants to improve their education.

So, can shop assistants' working hours be shortened? Facts have proved that it is possible. Here are two examples. One is that the leaders of the Baotou State-owned store heard the voices of the shop assistants and called on them to promote the advanced experience of the "two-stage accounting method," which is to use the spare time between 5 and 6 p.m. every day when business is not busy to reconcile accounts once, and the remaining accounts are settled after work. In this way, the accounting work after work has been shortened from more than an hour to about twenty minutes. Another example is that the leaders of the Baotou Food Company heard the voices of the shop assistants, often went deep into the masses, understood the situation, and guided the work and solved problems at any time, which greatly reduced the number and time of meetings.

From this, people suddenly realize that the reason why shop assistants work long hours is that the leaders of the commercial departments do not go deep into the lower levels, do not care about the masses, do not listen to the voices of the masses, and do not promote advanced experience.

### 售货员的工作时间为什么那样长

    售货员的工作时间为什么那样长
    本报记者　刘衡
    包头市商业部门有很多女售货员，她们当中很多人已经有了丈夫。在她们的丈夫当中流传着一句话：“找老婆不找售货员！”
    原来是：售货员的工作时间太长了。一个星期要开六、七次会。除掉开会，每天还要工作十小时左右，常常忙到半夜才能回家。做丈夫的下班要抱娃娃，要等着给妻子开门。如果老婆是个胆小怕走夜路的人，做丈夫的还得半夜起床，到外边去接她。
    为什么售货员的工作时间那样长呢？
    有的领导人说：“这是因为我们人手太少了。”的确，包头工业基地自1953年开始筹备建设以来，人口一天比一天增加，各种行业都跟不上去，急需各地大力支援。可是，人手少是不是需要用“延长工时”的办法来解决呢？不能的！拿包头国营商店说吧，因为售货员经常休息不好，病号一月比一月增多，有一个月，到医院看病的就有四六四人次。这样一来，人手就更少了。
    有的领导人说：“售货员工作时间长，是因为他们很多人文化太低了。”的确，有些售货员因为文化低，每天结账，算来算去，就把工作时间拖长了。可是，文化低就应该提高，领导上应该给他们提高文化的时间。据统计，包头市许多职工业余文化学校缺课最多的就是售货员。这样一来，售货员的文化更难提高了。
    那么，售货员的工作时间是不是可以缩短呢？事实证明，是可以的。这里有两个例子。一个是：包头国营商店的领导人听到了售货员的呼声，号召售货员推行先进经验“两段结账法”，就是利用每天下午五、六点钟业务不忙的空隙结一次账，其余账务等下班后再结算。这样，下班后的结账工作就由一个多小时缩短到二十来分钟了。另外一个例子是：包头食品公司的领导人听到了售货员的呼声，经常深入群众，了解情况，随时随地指导工作，解决问题，就把开会的次数和时间大大减少了。
    由此人们也就恍然大悟，原来售货员工作时间长是因为商业部门的领导人不深入下层，不关心群众，不倾听群众呼声，不推广先进经验。
