    Shandong Massively Manufactures Granular Fertilizer
    (Our newspaper, Jinan) Shandong Province plans to build twenty-four new granular fertilizer plants this year, and seventeen of them have been put into production by the end of June. The factories that are already in production include those in Jinan, Yantai, Jining, Linqing, and Weihai. As of June 20th, according to incomplete statistics, approximately 2.6 million jin of granular fertilizer have been produced. Chemical tests have proven that the quality of this fertilizer is equal to the effectiveness of soybean cake fertilizer, and it can be used as topdressing or as base fertilizer. Because these granular fertilizers are made from locally sourced materials, the price is low. Currently, the price of granular fertilizer in the Shandong area has dropped from 1 jiao 2 fen per jin to 9 fen.
    Among the twenty-four new granular fertilizer plants in Shandong Province, seven are mechanized plants, and the rest are manual manufacturing plants. After all of these factories are put into production, the estimated annual output of granular fertilizer can reach about 200 million jin. (Xiang Cun)

    山东大量制造颗粒肥料
    本报济南讯　山东省今年计划新建的二十四个颗粒肥料厂，到六月底已有十七个厂先后投入生产。现在已经进行生产的有济南、烟台、济宁、临清、威海等厂。截至六月二十日止，据不完全统计，已生产出颗粒肥料约260余万斤。经过化验证明，这种肥料的质量与豆饼肥效相等，可做追肥，也可做基肥。由于这些颗粒肥料都是就地取材制成的，因而价格低廉。目前，山东地区每斤颗粒肥料的价格已由一角二分降至九分。
    山东省新建的二十四个颗粒肥料厂中，有七个机械化工厂，其余都是手工制造厂。这些厂全部投入生产以后，预计颗粒肥料年产量可达两亿斤左右。　（向村）
