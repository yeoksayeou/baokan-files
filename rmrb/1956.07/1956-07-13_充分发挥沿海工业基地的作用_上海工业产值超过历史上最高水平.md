Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, July 11th: Shanghai's total industrial output value for the first half of this year has exceeded its historical peak. The industrial output value for the first half of the year increased by 6% compared to the original plan and by a quarter compared to the same period last year. The phenomenon of "loose at the beginning and tight at the end" in the implementation of annual plans in the past five years has been changed this year.

Because of the accelerated pace of capital construction in various regions, Shanghai's machinery industry has received significantly more orders than in previous years. The total output value of the machinery industry in the first half of the year increased by nearly onefold compared to the same period last year. The output of major products such as power boilers, generators, electric motors, transformers, and metal cutting machine tools shipped to various regions has increased by onefold to twofolds compared to the same period last year.

In the first half of the year, Shanghai's industrial departments, in support of the agricultural cooperativization movement, produced a batch of agricultural machinery, hardware, loudspeakers, telephones, sewing machines, bicycles, and other products for supply to the countryside, in addition to manufacturing a batch of double-wheeled moldboard plows.

Factories manufacturing light industrial machinery and textile industrial machinery have increased the production of many spinning frames, looms, printing presses, paper machines, rubber machines, soap machines, and pharmaceutical machines to meet the needs of light industrial development.

All types of textile industries in the city, including cotton, wool, silk, and linen, presented a comprehensive prosperous scene in the first half of the year. Compared to the same period last year, the output of cotton yarn and cotton cloth increased by nearly 30%, burlap sacks increased by two-thirds, fine woolen fabrics and silk increased by more than one-third, and knitted goods such as socks and undershirts also increased to varying degrees. The quality of cotton cloth produced in the second quarter was better than ever before.

Light industrial products with relatively high growth in the first half of the year include leather, grease, cigarettes, and soap. The output of fountain pens and paper also increased by 20% compared to the same period last year.

    新华社上海11日电　上海市今年上半年的工业生产总值超过历史上的最高水平。上半年的工业产值，比原计划增加了6％，比去年同期增长四分之一。过去五年中执行年度计划的前松后紧现象，今年得到了改变。
    因为各地加快基本建设的速度，上海机械工业接受的订货比往年大大增加。上半年机械工业的总产值比去年同期增加了将近一倍。运往各地的动力锅炉、发电机、电动机、变压器、金属切削机床等主要产品的产量比去年同期增长一倍到两倍以上。
    上半年，上海市工业部门为支援农业合作化运动，除制造了一批双轮带铧犁以外，还生产了一批农业机器、五金器材、扩音机、电话机、缝纫机、自行车等产品供给农村。
    制造轻工业机械和纺织工业机械的工厂，适应轻工业发展需要，增产了许多细纱机、织布机、印刷机、造纸机、橡胶机、肥皂机和制药机。
    全市棉、毛、丝、麻各类纺织工业，上半年呈现全面繁荣的景象。今年上半年和去年同期比较，棉纱、棉布的产量增加近30％，麻袋增加三分之二，精纺呢绒和丝绸都增加了三分之一以上，袜子、汗衫背心等针织品也都有不同程度的增产。第二季度所产棉布质量之好，是过去所没有的。
    轻工业产品在上半年增长较多的是皮革、油脂、卷烟、肥皂等。钢笔和纸张的产量也都比去年同期增长了20％。
