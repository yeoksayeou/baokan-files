    A Pleasing Beginning
    Yang Xiwen
    Among the film posters that frequently attract the attention of the audience, there recently appeared a film poster with a novel form and unique style—the poster created by the painter Jiang Zhaohe for the film "Malan Flower Blooms."
    The production level of our film posters is not high. Some still cannot escape the vulgar style of old commercial advertising paintings, while others rigidly imitate the forms of Western advertising paintings. Therefore, what appears on the screen are often scenes of men and women embracing that have very little connection with the content of the film, or simply verbatim reproductions of certain shots from the film; there is no artistic conception, and the forms and colors are also generally mediocre. Looking at such film posters, one really feels like chewing wax!
    Why does this situation occur? I think a very important reason is that many painters have not yet paid attention to film posters. Until the appearance of the "Malan Flower Blooms" poster, not many artists had participated in this work. At the "Exhibition of Polish Posters and Book Illustrations," we saw examples of Polish painters creating highly artistic and technically sophisticated posters for films such as "The Last Stage," "Lost Childhood," and "The Government Inspector," which are worth learning from.
    Now let us look at the "Malan Flower Blooms" poster again. The center of the picture is the simple and beautiful portrait of the film's protagonist, Malan. With his skilled technique, the painter not only focuses on depicting the character's external features, but also conveys the character's inner emotions. From this character image, we see a young woman with excellent qualities, not a rigid, lifeless portrait. In the secondary position of the picture, the painter also depicts bulldozers and Malan flowers as embellishments. These detailed descriptions not only concisely express the film's theme but also vividly highlight the film's poetic name—"Malan Flower Blooms." The whole picture is simple and beautiful, and the structure is also very symmetrical. This painting is painted with traditional Chinese color and ink painting techniques and can be said to be a film poster with a national style.
    The poster created by the painter Jiang Zhaohe for "Malan Flower Blooms" is a pleasing beginning. This painting shows that the painter has begun to pay attention to the art form of film posters, and it heralds that bright flowers will bloom in this artistic garden!

    可喜的开端
    杨西文
    经常为观众所注目的电影宣传画里面，最近出现了一幅形式新颖，风格独特的宣传画——画家蒋兆和为影片“马兰花开”创作的宣传画。
    我们的电影宣传画的制作水平是不高的。有些还脱离不了旧商业广告画的庸俗作风，有的却是生硬地搬弄西洋广告画的形式，因此出现在画面上的，常是一些跟影片内容关联极少的男女拥抱的场面，或者就是影片中某一镜头的原样翻版；没有什么艺术构思，形式，色调也一般化。这样的电影宣传画，看起来真使人有味同嚼蜡的感觉！
    为什么会出现这种情况呢？我认为其中很重要的一个原因是：很多画家还没有重视电影宣传画，直到“马兰花开”的宣传画出现以前，还没有多少美术家参加这个工作。在“波兰宣传画和书籍插画展览会”上，我们看到了波兰画家为影片“最后阶段”、“失去了的童年”、“钦差大臣”等所作的具有高度艺术技术的宣传画的实例，是值得我们学习的。
    现在让我们再来看“马兰花开”的宣传画吧。画面中心是影片主人公——马兰的朴素、优美的肖像。画家以其熟练的技巧，在着力于描绘人物外形特征的同时，也传达出了人物内心的情感。从这个人物形象上，我们看到的是一个具有优秀品质的年轻妇女，而不是一个死板的、无生气的画像。在画面的次要地位，画家又衬托地描绘了推土机和马兰花，这些细致的描写，不但概括地表现了影片的主题思想，也把影片的富有诗意的名字——
  “马兰花开”很好地烘托了出来。整个画面是简洁而美丽的，结构也非常匀称。这幅画是用我国传统的彩墨画技法来绘制的，可以说是一幅具有民族风格的电影宣传画。
    画家蒋兆和为“马兰花开”创作的宣传画，是一个可喜的开端。这幅画说明画家已经开始注意电影宣传画这种艺术形式，它预示着在这一艺术园地里，将开出鲜艳的花来！
