Why are Living Costs High in Shenyang?
By Our Correspondent Jin Yukun

    A problem commonly felt by people living in Shenyang or other cities in Northeast China is that prices here are expensive and life is not easy.
    There are two types of people who reflect these opinions most frequently. One type is cadres and workers transferred from within the customs (关内, referring to areas south and east of the Great Wall). They used to live quite well within the customs or in the south, but after being transferred to the Northeast, their lives became somewhat strained. The other type is people who frequently go to Beijing, Tianjin, or Shanghai to attend meetings or handle affairs. Every time they return from within the customs, they always carry large bags and small packages, buying everything for the whole family. Some people told me that although they have worked in Shenyang for many years, they never buy a pair of leather shoes or have a suit made here.
    These opinions are not without basis. Historically, Northeast China has always been a high-price area. Except for coal, soybeans, sorghum, etc., the prices of most consumer goods are much more expensive than within the customs.
    First, let's look at the prices of daily industrial products. Anyone who has been to the Northeast has the impression that locally produced daily necessities are of poor quality and high price, and the regional price difference for daily necessities from within the customs is also too high. Men's leather shoes purchased from Changsha cost only 11.8 yuan per pair at the wholesale price, but after adding a 39% sales margin, the retail price reaches 16.5 yuan. However, the price of similar shoes produced in Shenyang is 19.7 yuan, making the shoes from within the customs much cheaper. In June, the Municipal Department Store imported ten kinds of leather shoes from Wuhan, and even after adding a high profit margin of 33%, they were still about 10% lower than the retail price of locally produced leather shoes. It is no wonder that those who have relatives and friends within the customs often have daily necessities sent from thousands of miles away, because even with postage, it is still much cheaper than buying locally.
    How much more expensive are daily necessities in Shenyang compared to within the customs? The Price Section of the Liaoning Provincial Department of Commerce made a calculation in April this year. The list price of department store goods (based on 375 varieties) from within the customs in Shenyang is 9.45% higher than in Tianjin and Shanghai. That is to say, department store goods are nearly 10% more expensive. It is reasonable for products from within the customs to be sold a little more expensively in Northeast China (a reasonable regional price difference is about 6% to 7%), but the problem now is that it is 2% to 6% higher than the reasonable price difference. What is even more unreasonable is that when comparing the prices of Northeast products (based on Shenyang list prices) and products from within the customs (based on Shanghai and Tianjin list prices) based on quality, Northeast products are 3.8% more expensive. Department store goods from within the customs, even after adding the regional price difference when transported to Shenyang, are still about 6.6% cheaper than local products.
    At present, locally produced daily necessities account for about 70% of the market in Liaoning Province. If the problem of the high price of local products cannot be solved, even if the prices of products from within the customs are adjusted, it will only make prices more chaotic and unreasonable.
    There are historical reasons for the high price of local products in Northeast China. Before liberation, Northeast China was in a state of division and was isolated from the market within the customs for a long time. After liberation, it was necessary to support the Liberation War within the customs, and later it was at the forefront of the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea. The high price level of industrial products at that time was indeed greatly related to objective conditions. However, since the stabilization of national prices in 1952, the Northeast region has not taken effective measures to address the problem of high prices of daily necessities, making local products adapt to the national price level. Instead, it has continued to use the method of closing itself off, raising the prices of products from within the customs to adapt to local price levels. For example, in order to protect locally produced leather shoes, Liaoning Province adopted a price difference of as high as 30% to 50% for leather shoes from within the customs. Some even used the profits from products from within the customs to subsidize the losses of local products (because the ex-factory price of local products was too high, the wholesale price was lower than the ex-factory price). This kind of "protection" inevitably has a negative impact on the development of local industry. The slow progress of local industry in improving quality in recent years is closely related to this "protection" policy. For workers and the masses, this "protection" artificially increases the burden of life.
    In addition to daily necessities, a large proportion of urban residents' expenditure is on non-staple foods. The most expensive non-staple food is fresh vegetables. People who are accustomed to eating vegetables for a few cents a pound in the south will be shocked when they come here in winter and spring. Most fresh vegetables sell for 50-60 cents to more than one yuan a pound, which is more expensive than fish and meat! Indeed, eating vegetables here is not easy. It is understood that most workers and the masses, in addition to the cabbage, radishes, and potatoes stored in autumn, cannot buy fresh vegetables at all for about six or seven months. According to a survey by the Shenyang Municipal Second Bureau of Commerce in April, leafy vegetables are on average 81% higher than in Tianjin. For example, spinach is 2.5 cents a pound in Tianjin and 22 cents in Shenyang, a difference of nearly eight times. Root vegetables are on average 54% higher; fish prices are 30% to 40% higher; and seasonings are 20% higher. According to this comparison, non-staple foods are about 30% higher than in Tianjin.
    The main reason why vegetables are expensive is the cold climate in Northeast China. Except for cabbage, potatoes, and radishes that are stored in autumn, other fresh vegetables are transported from Guangzhou, Wuhan, Beijing, Tianjin, and other places thousands of miles away, and transportation costs are often several times higher than the cost of vegetables. Although local greenhouses can produce some vegetables, the cost is higher than those transported from Guangzhou. In addition to the cold climate, there are also many problems in the operation of non-staple foods. First, due to poor coordination with the transportation department, they cannot be transported in time, or due to poor packaging, they are often frozen and damaged during transportation, resulting in a large amount of vegetable spoilage and loss. Second, the management of some state-owned and joint state-private non-staple food retail stores is also very chaotic. Some stores add the losses and wastes caused by poor management to the cost, and some stores raise prices when there is a shortage of vegetables. This has created a chaotic situation of high and low prices for non-staple foods. Third, too many personnel and too many turnover links have also relatively increased the cost of non-staple foods. For example, eggs have to be transferred four times (from the county supply and marketing cooperative to the county food company, then to the city food company for wholesale to retail stores), and the retail price is about 60% higher than the purchase price. Even so, each link is still shouting about losing money. The person in charge of the Shenyang Vegetable Company also believes that as long as the management work is effectively improved, it is entirely possible to reduce vegetable prices this winter.
    Here, what impresses outsiders the most is the unreasonable price of service industries. Dumplings cost 1.5 cents each in Beijing, but here they cost 2 to 3 cents. A bowl of wontons costs 10 cents in Beijing, but here it costs 25 cents. An ordinary meal in Shanghai costs 40 to 50 cents, but here you can't get anything good for more than 1 yuan. An ordinary dry-fried yellow croaker costs 1.6 yuan, which is a real threat to outsiders. It costs 5 to 10 cents to wash a shirt in Beijing, but here it costs 20 cents. Sewing soles on cloth shoes costs only 30 cents in Nanjing, 70 cents in Beijing, and more than 1 yuan here. In addition, haircuts, baths, movies, theater, making clothes, repairing watches, taking photos, and staying in hotels are all more expensive than in some cities within the customs.
    The high price of service industries is related to the traditional style of private businesses here, which is to seek high profits and sell less. As long as the profit is high, they don't care if business is slow. For example, the gross profit of the catering industry is not low. Generally, stir-fried dishes are about 30% to 60%, and noodles, dumplings, and wontons are about 60% to 70%, but the actual net profit is not much. Because the price is too high, few people eat there, and business is naturally slow. Slow business must rely on high prices to maintain, and the higher the price, the slower the business is bound to be. This is a fatal flaw that has long existed in the service industry.
    The socialist transformation of industry and commerce was originally a good opportunity to comprehensively reform this tradition of high profits and low sales, but according to recent understanding, there are still many obstacles. For example, after the joint state-private operation of the catering industry, a huge management organization was established (the city and district-level companies have about 600 people), and the expenses of these personnel are borne by the restaurants. According to a survey of seven restaurants, including the Siji Restaurant, the expenses shared by the company are equal to the total wages of the restaurant's employees. For example, the Beishi District Company has 69 people, but the six restaurants it manages have only 74 people, and even with the popsicle shops, there are only 173 people. The famous Xinweizhai Restaurant had one manager and one accountant, totaling nine people, before the joint operation. After the joint operation, there were three managers and four accountants, totaling twenty people, but the turnover did not increase. Therefore, it used to make money, but now it loses money. From the perspective of the entire industry, the restaurants themselves still make money, but they lose money because they have to bear the huge expenses of the company. The Municipal Catering Company has already made a plan to lose 100,000 yuan this year. Because it is going to lose money, it is naturally difficult to consider adjusting prices. Other industries, such as the photography industry, have even more management levels (municipal company, district company, general store, store). This inevitably increases the indirect costs of service stores. In addition, some handicraft industries that serve residents' lives have not only not been reasonably adjusted in the socialist transformation but have also raised prices, creating a very bad impact among the masses.
    The aspects mentioned above are the main parts that constitute the workers' living expenses. According to the analysis of the recent materials of the Liaoning Provincial Wage Reform Office, the burden on consumer goods for workers living in Shenyang is about 8% to 10% higher than in Tianjin. In addition, the actual wage income is about 8% lower than in Beijing and Tianjin, and the difference between the two is even greater. This is the reason why workers have so many opinions about prices. It should be noted here that compared with other major cities in Northeast China, Shenyang's prices are not the highest. The prices in cities such as Changchun, Harbin, and Qiqihar are even higher than in Shenyang.
    This situation is unreasonable and should be gradually changed. Of course, adjusting prices involves a wide range of issues and is extremely complex, requiring careful handling. However, a positive attitude must be adopted.
    From the current point of view, the conditions for adjusting the prices of consumer goods are not lacking. For example, the industrial departments of Liaoning Province have resolutely reduced the ex-factory prices of 107 kinds of daily industrial products by an average of 12.2% this year, with some reduced by about 20%. If commodity prices remain unchanged, not only will consumers have opinions, but it will also cause dissatisfaction among industrial departments.
    Gradually adjusting the price level of consumer goods in Northeast China to be consistent with the national price level will not only be beneficial to reducing the burden of workers' lives but also conducive to the progress of industrial production and the prosperity of commerce. In the past, due to high prices and poor quality, products were stockpiled, affecting the expanded reproduction of factories. Because the prices of local products are unreasonable, they cannot be sold within the province and are not wanted outside the province, bringing many difficulties to commercial work. After some commodities were sold to other provinces, because of high prices and poor quality, people demanded returns and compensation for losses. The Shaanxi Provincial Department Store even explicitly stipulated last year that the import of certain department store goods from Liaoning Province would be treated as a liability accident! All these situations show that the prices of consumer goods in Northeast China have really reached a time when they should be adjusted.

    沈阳的生活费用为什么高
    本报记者　金雨困
    居住在沈阳或东北其它一些城市的人，普遍感到的一个问题是：此地物价昂贵，生活不易。
    意见反映得最多的有两种人。一种是从关内调来的干部和职工，他们原先在关内或南方生活过得还不错，但是调到东北以后，生活就发生了某种程度的紧张。另一种是经常去北京、天津或上海参加会议或办事的人。他们每次从关里回来，手里总是提着大包小包，全家老小用的穿的都买了个齐全。有的人告诉我，他虽然在沈阳工作多年，但是从不在这里买一双皮鞋或做一套衣服。
    这些意见并不是没有根据的。从历史上看，东北一直是高物价区。除了煤、大豆、高粱等外，大部分生活消费品的价格要比关里贵得多。
    先看日用工业品的价格。到过东北的人，都有这样的印象，当地产的日用品，质量既坏，价格又高，关内来的日用品地区差价也太高。从长沙采购的男用牛皮鞋，进价每双只有十一元八角，加上39％的进销差价后，零售价就高达十六元五角。但是沈阳产的同类鞋价是十九元七角，比较起来还是关里来的鞋便宜得多。市百货公司六月份从武汉进的十种皮鞋，平均加上33％的高额差价以后，仍然低于当地产的皮鞋零售价10％左右。这就无怪那些在关里有亲戚朋友的人，经常要从数千里外寄来日用品，因为即使加上邮费，也还是比当地便宜得多。
    沈阳的日用品究竟比关里贵多少？辽宁省商业厅物价科在今年四月有一个计算。关内来的百货（以375种品种统计）在沈阳的牌价要比天津、上海高9.45％。就是说，百货要贵近10％。关内产品到东北卖得贵一点是合理的（合理的地区差价得6％到7％左右），但是现在的问题是比合理的差价要高到2％至6％。而更加不合理的是东北产品（以沈阳牌价）和关内产品（以上海、天津牌价）按质论价比较；东北产品要贵3.8％。关里的百货运到沈阳加上地区差价后，比起当地产品还要便宜6.6％左右。
    目前地方产的日用品在辽宁省市场上的比重要达70％左右，如果不能解决地方产品价格偏高的问题，即便调整了关内产品的价格，也只能使价格更加混乱和不合理。
    东北地方产品价格偏高是有它的历史原因的。解放前，东北一直处在割据状态，和关内市场长期隔绝。解放后，需要支援关内解放战争，以后又处于抗美援朝的前哨，当时工业品价格水平高，确是和客观条件有很大关系。但是从1952年全国物价稳定后，东北地区对日用品价格偏高问题，没有采取有效的措施，使当地的产品适应全国的物价水平，而是仍然以闭关自守的办法，提高关内产品价格来适应当地的物价水平。例如辽宁省为了保护当地生产的皮鞋，对关内来的皮鞋就采用了高达30％到50％的差价出售。有的甚至以关内产品的利润来补贴地方产品的亏损（因为地方产品出厂价过高，结果批发价还低于出厂价）。这样“保护”的结果，必然给地方工业的发展带来消极的影响。几年来地方工业在提高质量上进步迟缓，和这种“保护”政策是有很大关系的。对职工群众来说，这种“保护”就人为地增加了生活负担。
    除了日用品外，占城市居民支出比重较大的是副食品。副食品中最贵的要算新鲜蔬菜。在南方吃惯几分钱一斤蔬菜的人，在冬春两季来到这里就会使你大吃一惊，大部新鲜蔬菜要卖到五六角至一元多一斤，比鱼肉还贵！确实，在这里吃蔬菜是件大不易的事情。据了解，大部职工群众除秋季储藏的白菜、萝卜和土豆外，约有六七个月根本买不到新鲜蔬菜。据沈阳市第二商业局四月份调查：叶菜平均高于天津81％，如菠菜天津是二分五一斤，沈阳是二角二，相差近八倍；根菜平均高54％；鱼价高30％到40％；调味品高20％。根据这个比较，副食品大约要高于天津30％左右。
    蔬菜贵的主要原因是东北的气候冷。这里除了白菜、土豆、萝卜靠秋季储藏外，其它新鲜蔬菜都是靠从数千里外的广州、武汉和北京、天津等地运来，运输费用往往比蔬菜成本高出几倍。本地的温室虽然可以生产部分蔬菜，但是成本比广州运来的还高。除了气候冷以外，副食品经营上的问题也很多。第一，由于和运输部门配合不好，不能及时运出，或由于包装不好途中受冻，经常使蔬菜大量腐烂损耗。第二，某些国营和公私合营的副食品零售商店，经营也十分混乱，有的商店把经营不善造成的损失浪费也加到成本中去，有的商店在缺菜的时候哄抬价格。这样就造成了副食品价格此高彼低的混乱状况。第三，人员太多、周转环节太多，也相对地增高了副食品的成本。如鸡蛋要转四次手（从县供销社到县食品公司，再到市食品公司批发给零售店），零售价格就比收购价格增加了60％左右，就是这样，每个环节还都在叫喊赔钱。沈阳市蔬菜公司负责人也认为，只要切实改进管理工作，今年冬季降低蔬菜价格是完全可能的。
    在这里，最使外来的人印象不好的是服务性行业价格不合理。在北京一分五一个饺子，这里却要二分至三分。北京一角钱一碗馄饨，这里却要二角五。在上海吃顿普通饭四五角钱就可以，这里花一元多还吃不到什么好的，一个普通的干烧黄鱼就要一元六，对外来人真是一个威胁。在北京洗件衬衣五分至一角钱，在这里就要二角。布鞋绱底，在南京手工钱只三角，在北京是七角，这里是一元多。此外，理发、洗澡、看电影、看戏、做衣服、修表、照相、住旅馆，也无一不比关里的一些城市要贵。
    服务性行业价格贵，和这里私营商业厚利少销的传统作风有关。只要利厚一点，就是营业清淡一点也认为没有关系。如饮食业毛利并不薄，一般炒菜约在30％到60％，面条、饺子、馄饨要到60％至70％，但是实际所得纯利并不多。因为价格太高吃的人少，营业自然就清淡。营业清淡就必须依靠高价来维持，而价格越高营业也必然越清淡。这就是服务性行业长期存在的一个致命缺点。
    工商业社会主义改造，本是全面改革这种厚利少销传统的良好时机，但是据最近了解，仍然障碍很多。如饮食业合营后设立了庞大的管理机构（市区两级公司的人员约有600人），这些人员的开支都是由饮食店来负担的。据对四季饭店等七家调查，分摊公司的开支和本店职工的全部工资是相等的。如北市区区公司有六十九人，但是所管的六家饭店仅七十四人，加上冰棍店也仅有一百七十三人。著名的新味斋饭店，公私合营前一个经理一个会计共九人，合营后三个经理四个会计共二十人，而营业额并未增加，因此过去是赚钱的，现在赔本了。从全行业来看，饭店本身也还是赚钱的，但是要负担公司的庞大开支就赔钱了。市饮食业公司已经作出了今年赔钱十万元的计划。因为要赔钱，当然调整价格的问题就很难考虑了。其它行业如照像业，管理机构层次还要多（市公司、区公司、总店、店）。这样就必然增加了服务性商店的间接成本。还有一些为居民生活服务的手工业行业，在社会主义改造中不仅没有合理调整，反而涨了价，在群众中造成了极不好的影响。
    上边所说的几个方面，都是构成职工生活支出的主要部分。据最近辽宁省工资改革办公室的材料分析，在沈阳居住的职工在消费品的负担上约高于天津8％到10％左右。再加上实际工资所得约低于北京天津8％左右，两方面加起来悬殊更大。这就是目前职工对物价意见很多的原因所在。这里要说明的是，沈阳和东北其它一些主要城市比较，物价还不是最高的。像长春、哈尔滨、齐齐哈尔等市的物价比沈阳还要高。
    这种情况是不合理的，应该逐步改变。当然，调整价格，牵涉的面既广，问题也极复杂，需要谨慎从事。但是必须采取积极的态度。
    从目前来看，调整消费品的价格，条件也并不是不具备的。例如辽宁省工业部门今年已坚决将107种日用工业品出厂价平均降低了12.2％，其中有的降低了20％左右。如果商品价格仍然维持不动，不仅消费者有意见，而且也会引起工业部门的不满。
    逐步地调整东北地区消费品的价格水平，使它同全国物价水平相一致，这样不仅对减轻职工生活负担有好处，而且也有利于工业生产的进步和商业的活跃。过去由于价高质劣，产品积压，影响了工厂的扩大再生产。由于地方产品价格不合理，省内销不了、省外又不要，给商业工作带来了很多困难。有的商品销到外省后，因为价高质劣，人家纷纷要求退货和赔偿损失。陕西省百货公司去年甚至明文规定：如进辽宁省的某些百货就按责任事故论处！这种种情况都说明，东北地区的消费品价格，实在到了应该调整的时候了。
