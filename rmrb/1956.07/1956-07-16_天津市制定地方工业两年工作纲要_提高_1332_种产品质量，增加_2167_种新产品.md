Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, July 14th. Among the 1,332 products currently produced by Tianjin's local industry, those with national standards or standards from the Soviet Union and people's democratic countries must meet or approach these standards within the next two years; those without the above standards must also reach or approach the standards of advanced domestic products of the same type within these two years.

This is the two-year struggle goal proposed to the city's local industry in the "Tianjin Local Industry Work Program for Improving Quality and Increasing Variety from 1956 to 1957" announced by the Tianjin Municipal People's Committee on the 13th.

This work program also stipulates that Tianjin's local industry must trial-produce 2,167 new products and new designs in the next two years, of which 2,011 must be officially put into production.

The program specifies concrete requirements for improving the quality of various major products within two years. For example, steel ingots must solve quality problems such as shrinkage cavities and sand inclusions, so that the rate of acceptable products reaches about 98%; the 1615M lathe must improve precision, with the screw bending not exceeding fifteen threads; diesel engines must reduce fuel consumption; knitted underwear must solve quality problems such as high shrinkage rate, loose ribs, rough sewing, and dull colors; rubber shoes with cloth uppers must solve problems such as not being wear-resistant, hard sponge soles, and degumming, etc.

The program points out that low product quality and a lack of variety are serious problems that have long existed in Tianjin's local industry for several years. The program says that after the leaders have the determination and the masses are mobilized, the key to solving these problems is to improve enterprise management, improve technical levels, and earnestly strengthen basic technical work. To this end, the program puts forward a series of specific measures to strengthen technical work.

The program stipulates that each industrial bureau should establish technical research institutes and product inspection institutes as needed, in order to help factories research and solve technical problems and assist in managing product quality. Each industrial company and larger factory should also establish and strengthen design rooms, pattern rooms, and laboratories as needed, and be equipped with deputy managers and deputy factory directors in charge of improving product quality and increasing new products. Each factory must also improve management systems, strengthen design work, implement quality standards and process regulations, and gradually carry out technical transformation work.

The program also stipulates that in order to increase technical strength, sixty engineers and a large number of technicians and technical staff must be trained within two years. To this end, each industrial bureau and industrial company must run various technical schools and training courses, encourage engineers to conduct scientific research in combination with practical problems in production, and mobilize and organize technical personnel to sign contracts with workers to ensure teaching and learning; each factory director and administrative management personnel with a junior high school education or above must learn production technical knowledge.

The program also stipulates that each industrial bureau and industrial company must hold professional meetings at least once every six months according to industry and type of work, summarize and promote advanced experience, and generally improve the technical level of employees. Within two years, at least 180 existing advanced experiences that have a great effect on improving quality must be promoted.

The program concludes by saying that in order to meet the different needs of the masses, the daily consumer goods produced by each factory in the future will be graded and classified, heavy industrial and electromechanical products will be graded and classified, and a product warranty and exchange system will be gradually established to establish product credibility.

    天津市制定地方工业两年工作纲要
    提高1332种产品质量，增加2167种新产品
    新华社天津14日电　天津市地方工业目前出产的1，332种产品中，有国定标准或苏联和人民民主国家标准的，要在今明两年内达到或接近这个标准；没有上述标准的，也要在这两年达到或接近国内同类型先进产品的标准。
    这是天津市人民委员会十三日公布的“天津市地方工业1956年到1957年提高质量、增加品种的工作纲要”中，向全市地方工业提出的两年奋斗目标。
    这个工作纲要还规定了天津市地方工业要在今明两年内试制出2，167种新产品和新花样，其中有2，011种并且要正式投入生产。
    纲要对各种主要产品都规定了在两年内提高质量的具体要求。例如钢锭要解决缩孔、夹砂等质量问题，使正品率达到98％左右；1615M车床要提高精密度，丝杠弯度不超过十五丝；柴油机要减少耗油量；针织内衣要求解决缩水率大、罗纹松、缝制粗糙、色泽不鲜艳等质量问题；布面胶鞋要解决不耐磨、海绵底硬和开胶等质量问题，等等。
    纲要指出，产品质量低、品种少是天津市地方工业几年来长期存在的严重问题。纲要说，在领导人员有了决心和群众发动起来以后，解决这些问题的关键就是改进企业管理、提高技术水平和切实地加强基础性的技术工作。为此，纲要提出了一系列加强技术工作的具体措施。
    纲要规定，各工业局要根据需要建立技术研究所和产品检验所，以便帮助工厂研究和解决技术上的问题和协助管理产品质量。各工业公司和规模较大的工厂，也要根据需要建立和加强设计室、图案室、化验室等机构，并且配备掌管提高产品质量和增加新产品的副经理、副厂长。各厂还要健全管理制度，加强设计工作，贯彻执行质量标准和工艺规程，逐步地进行技术改造工作。
    纲要中还规定，为增加技术力量，两年内要培养出六十名工程师和大批技师、技术员。各工业局、工业公司为此必须举办各种技术学校和训练班，鼓励工程师结合生产上的实际问题进行科学研究，动员和组织技术人员同工人签定保教保学合同；各厂厂长和初中文化程度以上的行政管理人员，都要学习生产技术知识。
    纲要还规定，各工业局、工业公司每半年至少要按行业和按工种召开一次专业会议，总结和推广先进经验，普遍提高职工的技术水平。两年内，至少要推广目前已有的对提高质量有很大作用的一百八十项先进经验。
    纲要最后说，为了满足群众的不同需要，今后各厂生产的日常消费品将分等分类，重工业和机电产品将分等分级，并且逐步建立产品保修、保换制度，树立产品的信誉。
