    Seriously and Thoroughly Examine Ethnic Work
    On June 22, the Yunnan Daily published an editorial stating: In recent years, Yunnan Province has basically correctly implemented the Party's ethnic policies, and ethnic relations have undergone fundamental changes.

    However, the generalized working style in dealing with ethnic issues is currently quite common, failing to actively meet the new demands of ethnic minority masses in accordance with the new situation. Some believe that ethnic issues no longer exist after the land reform, so they mechanically apply the experience of Han areas, failing to fully take into account ethnic characteristics based on the specific circumstances of local ethnic groups. There is a lack of necessary consideration for ethnic minorities in collectivization policies and economic work.

    All these shortcomings and errors must be treated seriously. We must realistically analyze the problems through inspection and conscientiously summarize experiences and lessons. We must extensively and deeply listen to the opinions of ethnic minority masses, and also listen to the opinions of ethnic minority public leaders. We must promote democracy and encourage them to speak their minds.

专栏：地方报纸评论摘要

    认真深入地检查民族工作
    六月二十二日，云南日报发表社论说：几年来，云南省基本上正确地贯彻执行了党的民族政策，民族关系已经起了根本变化。
    但是，当前对待民族问题上的一般化的工作作风相当普遍，没有根据新的形势，积极满足少数民族群众新的要求。有的认为土地改革以后民族问题不存在了，于是生搬硬套汉族地区的经验，没有根据当地民族的特殊情况，去充分照顾民族特点。在合作化政策和经济工作上对少数民族缺乏必要的照顾。
    所有这些缺点和错误，必须严肃地对待。要通过检查实事求是地分析问题所在，认真总结经验教训。广泛深入地听取少数民族群众的意见，同时也要听取少数民族公众领袖人物的意见，一定要发扬民主，使他们把心中的话说出来。
