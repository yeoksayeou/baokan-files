Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, July 19th: TASS Budapest, July 19th: The Central Committee of the Hungarian Working People's Party held a plenary session in Budapest on July 18th.

Hegedüs made a report on the first item on the agenda: organizational matters.

Hegedüs said that the Politburo had discussed Comrade Rakosi's request to be relieved of his post as First Secretary of the Central Committee and to withdraw from the Politburo, and had agreed to this request.

The draft resolution on this issue, read by Hegedüs, affirmed the merits of Mátyás Rákosi, and stated that the Central Committee of the Hungarian Working People's Party, in accordance with Comrade Rákosi's own request, had relieved him of his position as a member of the Politburo and First Secretary of the Central Committee.

The draft resolution pointed out that the Politburo believed that taking this decision would benefit the Party and the successful completion of the tasks facing us.

Comrade Hegedüs continued, saying that the necessity of satisfying Comrade Rakosi's request to be relieved of his post as First Secretary of the Central Committee was primarily not due to the mistakes that had already been made, but because Comrade Rakosi, as First Secretary of the Central Committee, partly due to his illness and partly due to his age, had been unable to lead the struggle to complete the tasks facing our Party. In the past two years, Comrade Rakosi's working hours had been greatly limited due to illness; his health had deteriorated even further recently. Therefore, doctors advised him to undergo long-term treatment. This greatly affected the work of the Politburo and the Central Committee. In view of this situation, Comrade Rakosi himself requested to be relieved of his current position.

Comrade Hegedüs then said that we should be prepared: now the enemies, and even individual wavering elements, want to use the dismissal of Comrade Rakosi as First Secretary of the Central Committee to create chaos; possibly, the right-wing elements gathered around Imre Nagy are also attempting to do so. We should be vigilant and resolutely crush all attempts to create chaos. We should do everything in our power to strengthen the discipline of our Party and consolidate the unity of the Party.

The Central Committee then passed the following resolution:

The Central Committee affirms Comrade Mátyás Rákosi's merits in the Hungarian and international workers' movement and in the struggle for the bright future of the Hungarian people and for a socialist Hungary, and agrees with what is stated in Comrade Rakosi's letter and, at his own request, relieves him of his position as a member of the Politburo and First Secretary of the Central Committee.

The Central Committee unanimously elected Ernő Gerő as First Secretary of the Central Committee.

The plenary session of the Central Committee elected Tivadar Madarász and Ernő Molnár (both of whom were originally alternate members of the Central Committee), László Földes, Jenő Hazai, Imre Horváth, János Kádár, Gyula Kállai, György Marosán, and Imre Mézes as members of the Central Committee.

The plenary session of the Central Committee elected Jenő Fock, József Hajdú, János Horváth, János Kukucska, Károly Nemeth and Ernő Rudas as alternate members of the Central Committee.

The Central Committee elected János Kádár, Károly Kiss, György Marosán and József Révai as members of the Politburo.

The plenary session of the Central Committee elected Sándor Gáspár and Sándor Ronai as alternate members of the Politburo.

In the second item on the agenda, the plenary session of the Central Committee heard the report of the Politburo of the Central Committee on "Struggling for Socialist Democracy within a Unified Party."

The rapporteur on this agenda item was Ernő Gerő, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Hungarian Working People's Party.

    匈劳动人民党举行中央全会
    同意拉科西辞职　选格罗任第一书记
    新华社19日讯　塔斯社布达佩斯十九日讯：匈牙利劳动人民党中央委员会全体会议七月十八日在布达佩斯开幕。
    赫格居斯就第一项议程——组织问题作了报告。
    赫格居斯说，政治局讨论了拉科西同志关于解除他中央委员会第一书记职务和让他退出政治局的请求，并且同意了这项请求。
    在赫格居斯宣读的关于这一问题的决议草案中肯定了马加斯·拉科西的功绩，并且说明，匈牙利劳动人民党中央委员会根据拉科西同志本人的请求解除了他的政治局委员和中央委员会第一书记的职务。
    在决议草案中指出，政治局认为，采取这项决定将有利于党，有利于胜利地完成我们面临的任务。
    赫格居斯同志继续说，满足拉科西同志关于解除他中央委员会第一书记职务之所以必要，首先并不是由于已经犯的错误，而是由于拉科西同志作为中央委员会的第一书记，部分由于他的疾病，部分由于年纪太大，没有能够领导争取完成我党面临任务的斗争。在过去两年间，拉科西同志由于疾病而工作时间受到很大限制；他的健康状况最近更加恶化了。因此医生建议他进行长期治疗。这一点大大影响了政治局以及中央委员会的工作。鉴于这种情况，拉科西同志自己请求解除他现在担任的职务。
    赫格居斯同志接着说，我们应当有所准备：现在敌人，甚至个别动摇分子想利用解除拉科西同志中央委员会第一书记职务一事来制造混乱；可能，聚集在伊姆雷·纳吉周围的右派分子也企图这样做。我们应当戒备，并且应当最坚决地粉碎一切制造混乱的企图。我们应当竭尽全力来加强我们党的纪律，巩固党的团结。
    中央委员会接着通过了如下的决议：
    中央委员会肯定马加斯·拉科西同志在匈牙利和国际工人运动中以及在争取匈牙利人民的美好前途和争取社会主义匈牙利的斗争中的功绩，同时同意拉科西同志的信中所讲的，并且根据他自己的请求解除他担任的政治局委员和中央委员会第一书记的职务。
    中央委员会一致选举埃诺·格罗同志为中央委员会第一书记。
    中央委员会全体会议补选蒂瓦达尔·马杜赛克和埃诺·莫尔纳尔（以上两人原为中央委员会候补委员），拉斯洛·费尔德什、耶诺·哈札伊、伊姆雷·霍瓦特、雅诺希·卡达尔、居拉·卡拉伊、捷尔吉·马罗森、伊姆雷·麦泽为中央委员会委员。
    中央委员会全体会议补选耶诺·弗克、约瑟夫·哈伊杜、雅诺希·霍瓦特、雅诺希·库库契卡、卡罗伊·内麦特和埃诺·鲁达什为中央委员会候补委员。
    中央委员会选举雅诺希·卡达尔、卡罗伊·基什、捷尔吉·马罗森和约瑟夫·里瓦伊为政治局委员。
    中央委员会全体会议选举桑多·加什帕尔和桑多·罗奈伊为政治局候补委员。
    在第二项议程中，中央委员会全体会议听取了中央委员会政治局的关于“在统一的党内，为社会主义民主而斗争”的报告。
    这一议程的报告人是匈牙利劳动人民党中央委员会第一书记埃诺·格罗。
