Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, July 14th: The "Times of India" yesterday refuted Dulles's recent renewed attack on neutralism in an article entitled "Dulles is at it again."

    The newspaper said: "Dulles believes that neutral countries are 'very few.' This is typically and entirely his own view, because everyone admits that the majority of the countries participating in the Bandung Conference were, and still are, inspired by 'neutral' sentiments."

    The newspaper then refuted another of Dulles's arguments, saying: "There is also absolutely nothing irreconcilable between membership in the United Nations and non-participation in blocs. Such membership does not oblige any country to participate in alliances and blocs; if there is any conflict, then that conflict must be in the policies of those countries which, although members of this international organization (the United Nations), are seeking security outside the United Nations in so-called regional defense arrangements."

    After pointing out the obvious state of confusion in the statements of American officials regarding neutralism, the article asked: "Which of the countless definitions of 'neutrality' given by the President, Vice President, and Secretary of State of the United States reflects the official policy of the American government?"

    印报斥杜勒斯攻击中立主义
    据新华社新德里14日电　“印度时报”昨天在一篇题为“杜勒斯又来了”的文章中驳斥了杜勒斯最近又一次攻击中立主义的谈话。
    这家报纸说：“杜勒斯认为中立国家是‘非常少’的。这典型地而且完完全全地是他自己的看法，因为大家都承认，参加万隆会议的国家大多数都曾经受到而且现在仍然受到‘中立’情绪的鼓舞。”
    这家报纸接着驳斥杜勒斯的另一个论点说：“联合国会员资格和不参加集团之间也决没有任何不可调和的地方。这种会员资格并不使任何国家有义务要参加联盟和集团，如果说有任何抵触的话，那末这种抵触就一定是在那样一些国家的政策里面，这些国家虽然是（联合国）这个国际组织的会员，但是却在联合国以外在所谓区域性防御安排中寻求安全。”
    文章在指出美国官方负责人关于中立主义的谈话已经陷于明显的混乱状态以后问道：“美国总统、副总统和国务卿对‘中立，所下的数不清的各种各样的定义，究竟那一个反映美国政府的官方政策呢？”
