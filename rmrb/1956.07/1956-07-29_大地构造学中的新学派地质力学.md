    A New School of Thought in Tectonics: Geomechanics
    Geomechanics is a new branch of geology, and also a new marginal science. It starts from analyzing various deformations and relative displacements in rocks, studies the integrated forms of their coordination, arrangement and distribution, determines the laws of their interrelationships, and investigates the stress conditions under which various deformations and relative displacements occur in rock masses and blocks of different properties, in order to demonstrate the relative movements of various parts of the Earth's crust. Advanced scientific countries around the world, especially the Soviet Union, have already started research in the field of tectonic geophysics; however, the systematic organization of tectonic forms from a mechanical point of view based on the results of their analysis should be attributed to the pioneering work of Chinese geologist Li Siguang and his collaborators.
    As early as thirty years ago, Li Siguang had already noticed the mechanical significance of various folds and fractures in rocks, and pointed out their connection with the modes of crustal movement they express. Through the long-term work of him and the geologists under his guidance, several tectonic systems of different sizes and ages have been discovered in vast areas of the Earth's crust. From some of their morphological characteristics and mechanical analysis, several structural patterns with certain regularities have been determined, such as "mountain" type, "many" type, "歹" type, etc. Moreover, it has been proven from experiments on elasto-plastic materials that a certain structural pattern is often the result of a certain mode of stress application. Based on the rules of structural patterns, it is now possible to predict certain tectonic phenomena in some areas. This predictability of tectonic phenomena is a first in the development of geology. Because of these research results, geomechanics has gradually formed a new school in tectonic research.
    Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, Li Siguang's research has made new progress. In his book "On the Three Basic Concepts of Geological Structure" published in 1953, he made a theoretical summary of his several basic views on geological structure. In "Spiral Structures and Other Problems Related to the Complex of Tectonic Systems in Northwest China" published in 1954-1955, in addition to proposing the newly discovered spiral structure, he also systematically analyzed the various tectonic systems in Northwest China and discussed their relationships from a mechanical point of view. This May, he gave an academic report on "The Problem of Crustal Movement" at the Beijing Geological College, focusing on introducing his theory. At the 30th Annual Meeting of the Geological Society of China recently held in Beijing, he presented an academic paper on "Two Typical Lotus-shaped Spiral Structures" based on his recent research insights.
    Under the promotion of the Central Government's policy of "Letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend," a geomechanics research office has been established in the Ministry of Geology this year to carry out research in this area. At present, the geomechanics research office has sent several geologists to the Northwest and Central South regions to conduct research on tectonics in conjunction with geological exploration. The rock property and model experiment section of the geomechanics research office will also gradually start working this year. (Kui)

    大地构造学中的新学派地质力学
    地质力学是地质学的一个新部门，也是一门新的边缘科学。它从分析岩石中各种形变和相对位移入手，研究它们配合、排列和分布的综合形态，确定它们相互联系的规律，推究在不同性质的岩块和地块中所产生的各种形变和相对位移的应力的条件，来论证地壳各部分的相对运动。世界各科学先进国家，首先是苏联，在地质构造物理学方面已经展开了研究工作；但是根据分析大地构造形态的结果，从力学观点把它们加以系统化的，应当属于我国地质学家李四光和他的协作者所首创。
    早在三十年以前，李四光已注意到岩石中各种褶皱和破裂的力学意义，并指出它们同它们所表达的地壳运动方式的联系。经过他和在他指导下的地质学家们的长期工作，在地壳上广大范围内发现了不同大小、不同时代的若干个构造体系，从它们的某些形态特征和力学分析确定了几个具有一定规律性的构造型式，如“山”字型、“多”字型、“歹”字型等。并且从弹塑性物质实验中证明了一定的构造型式常常是一定的应力作用方式的结果。根据构造型式的规律，已能在某些地区预见到某些构造现象。这种构造现象的预见性，在地质学发展中尚属首创。由于这些研究成果，使得地质力学在大地构造研究中逐渐形成了一个新的学派。
    中华人民共和国成立以来，李四光的研究工作更有了新的发展。他在1953年所著的“关于地质构造的三重基本概念”中，把他对地质构造的几个基本观点作了理论性的总结。1954—1955所著的“旋卷构造及其他有关中国西北部大地构造体系复合问题”中，除了提出了新发现的旋卷构造外，还系统地分析了我国西北地区的各个构造体系，从力学上讨论了它们的关系。今年五月，他曾在北京地质学院作了“地壳运动问题”的学术报告，把他的学说作了重点介绍。最近在北京召开的中国地质学会第三十届年会上，他以最近研究的心得，提出了“两个典型的莲花状旋卷构造”的学术论文。
    在中央“百家争鸣”方针的推动下，今年已在地质部设立地质力学研究室来进行这方面的研究。目前地质力学研究室已派出若干地质学家分别到西北、中南地区结合地质勘探进行大地构造的研究工作。地质力学研究室所设岩石性质和模型实验部分，今年内也将陆续开始工作。　（葵）
