Polish "People's Tribune" Publishes Article
Makes Preliminary Conclusions on Poznan Events

(Reported by this newspaper) Warsaw dispatch: On July 6th, the Polish "People's Tribune" published an article entitled "Preliminary Conclusions." The article stated: "The interrogation of the armed provocateurs in Poznan is being conducted by the relevant authorities. However, after studying and analyzing the course of events, the following questions can now be raised: In Poznan on June 28th, there were two phenomena. One phenomenon was the workers' dissatisfaction and unrest, and the other was hostile actions against the People's Government. So the question is how did these two phenomena converge and act in concert? How did the enemy's armed provocations, which reached their peak that day, become intertwined with the strike action caused by economic problems?" The article stated: "Although our Party and the state oppose disrupting production organization and oppose strikes, it must be emphasized that no administrative measures or coercive methods were taken to arrest people. Because this fabricated rumor played a big role in the Poznan provocation, saying that the government arrested the delegation sent by the workers of the Poznan Stalin Metal Machinery Factory. In fact, this delegation had been satisfied in negotiations with the Ministry of Industry. It must be emphasized that the People's Government will not shoot at the working class today or in the future. Because the enemy is spreading rumors that the People's Government has started shooting at workers. It was precisely this principle of not allowing attacks on marching workers that prevented the Poznan government, the Party, even the public security organs, and the prison guards from taking timely action. Even the Party organs and activists were like this. Comrades who were at a loss did not distinguish between strikes, marches, and the illegal, forceful criminal acts that were already taking place at that time. They should be doing everything they can to oppose these criminal acts." The article stated: "From the standpoint of the people, the state, and the working class, what were the results? The workers had reasons for dissatisfaction, but the course of the Poznan events proves that the form they took was incorrect and dangerous." The article stated: "The Poznan events are a serious warning to the entire working class, especially to advanced workers and workers in large industrial enterprises, and an even more serious warning and painful lesson to our Party and workers' organizations such as trade unions. Remember Lenin's words: Bureaucratic errors and shortcomings of the proletarian state are one of the reasons for strike sentiment and action. The painful truth of the Poznan workers' strike action cannot be denied; the bureaucratic errors of our proletarian state and government contributed greatly to this strike." The article pointed out that in recent years, the state has had unavoidable economic difficulties, which are due to the war damage suffered by Poland, the need to develop heavy industry, and the need to establish a strong military industry. All of these have affected the people's living standards. The article also pointed out that some mistakes by the Party have aggravated these objective difficulties. The article pointed out that we should accept the criticism of Comrade Vittorio from Italy and not attribute everything to objective reasons. The article said, "In recent months, we have done a lot in terms of democratizing social and political life, which is very good. But we have been slow in democratizing economic life. We have not noticed, as Comrade Vittorio said, the limit of the sacrifices that workers are willing to make for the construction of a socialist future. Beyond this limit, differences will arise between the Party and the class. The main conclusion that the Poznan events give us is that this difference has manifested itself in action." The article said, "The economic tasks before us are very heavy, especially in the Poznan events, the enemy is urging us to accomplish these tasks, and at the same time, it requires us to increase the vigilance of the Party and the people." The article pointed out that we will strengthen the democratization of economic management at the greatest speed and increase the production of consumer goods. But the greatest speed cannot produce results immediately. The Party and the People's Government need the initiative, creativity, and consciousness of an organized people, first and foremost the working class, in the struggle to improve the economy and improve the people's living standards.

    波兰“人民论坛报”发表文章
    对波兹南事件作出初步结论
    本报讯　华沙消息：七月六日波兰“人民论坛报”登载题为“初步的结论”的一篇文章，文章说：“对波兹南武装挑衅者的审讯，正由有关机关进行中。但在对事件经过加以研究分析后，现在就可以提出如下的问题：六月二十八日的波兹南有两种现象，一种现象是工人的不满和波动，另一种现象是反对人民政府的敌对行为。那么问题就是这两种现象是怎样汇合起来并且一致行动的呢？在那天达到顶点的敌人的武装挑衅行为，是怎样同由经济问题引起的罢工行动交织在一起的呢？”文章说：“尽管我们的党和国家反对破坏生产组织，反对罢工，但是谁也未采取行政手段和强迫方法来抓来捕，这是必须强调的。因为这种捏造的谣言，在波兹南挑衅事件中起了很大作用，说是政府把波兹南斯大林五金机械厂工人派出的代表团逮捕了。实际上是这个代表团在同工业部的谈判中已得到了满足。人民政权今天和将来都不会向工人阶级开枪射击，必须强调这一点。因为敌人正造谣说是人民政府曾开始向工人射击。不许攻击游行的工人，正是这个原则，使波兹南的政府、党以至公安机关和监狱看守队，都未及时采取行动，甚至党的机关和积极分子们也如此。不知所措的同志们未能区别罢工、游行和当时就已发生的非法的强力的犯罪行为，他们正应全力去反对这种犯罪行为”。文章说：“从人民、国家和工人阶级的立场看来，有了什么结果呢？工人们有不满的理由，但是波兹南事件的经过证明，他们采取的这种形式是不正确的和危险的”。文章说：“波兹南事件对全体工人阶级特别对先进工人和大工业企业的工人，都是个严重的警告，而对我们党和工人组织如工会就是更严重的警告和痛苦的教训。记住列宁的话：无产阶级国家的官僚主义错误和缺点，是罢工情绪和行动的原因之一。波兹南工人的罢工行动的痛苦的真象是不能不承认的，我们无产阶级国家和政府的官僚主义错误在很大程度上促成了这次罢工”。文章指出，近几年来，国家有着不可避免的经济上的困难，这些困难是因为波兰曾遭受战争破坏又要发展重工业和不得不建立强大的军事工业。所有这些，都使人民生活水平受到影响。文章还指出，由于党的一些错误，又加重了这些客观上的困难。文章指出，应该接受意大利维多里奥同志的批评，不能把一切都推到客观原因上去。文章说，“近几月来，我们在社会政治生活的民主化方面作了很多事情，这是很好的。但是在经济生活的民主化方面，却作的慢了。我们没有注意到像维多里奥同志所说的工人为建设社会主义的未来所同意作的牺牲的界限，超出这个界限就要在党和阶级之间产生分歧。波兹南事件给我们的主要结论就是这种分歧已见诸行动”。文章说，“摆在我们面前的经济任务是很重的，尤其是在波兹南事件中，敌人督促着我们要实现这些任务，同时也要求我们提高党和人民的警惕性”。文章指出，我们将以最大的速度来加强经济管理中的民主化，并增加生产消费品的生产。但最大的速度也不能立刻得到结果。党和人民政府在为改善经济和提高人民生活水平的斗争中，是需要有组织的人民，首先是工人阶级的积极性创造性和自觉性的。
