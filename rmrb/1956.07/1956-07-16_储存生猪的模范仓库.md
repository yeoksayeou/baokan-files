Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, 14th -- The Changsha First Warehouse of the Hunan Provincial State-Owned Food Company did not have a single pig die in the first half of this year. The 76,947 live pigs that were taken into the warehouse for storage and management in the first half of the year gained an average of about one and a half jin of meat per head per day.

When this warehouse was established in early December 1953, the mortality rate of live pigs reached more than 40%. Later, the warehouse director, Communist Party member Pan Rui, led the staff to improve the feeding and management of live pigs, which reduced the mortality rate of live pigs year by year, but the phenomenon of death had not yet been eliminated. This year, the warehouse implemented the method of feeding by variety and economic accounting by pen, which further improved the enthusiasm of the feeding and management personnel. The feeders not only carried forward the advantages of their past work, but also created many new experiences. Most of the feeders have learned how to treat sick pigs. Communist Youth League member Peng Youcai created a feeding method of "fine feeding, frequent addition, less release, and thin before thick." The pigs he raised rarely get sick, and the pig that gained the most meat gained two jin of meat per day, creating the warehouse's latest record.

    储存生猪的模范仓库
    新华社长沙14日电　湖南省国营食品公司长沙第一仓库今年上半年没有死亡一头猪。上半年进仓储存保管的76，947头生猪，平均每头每天长肉一斤半左右。
    这个仓库在1953年12月初成立的时候，生猪死亡率达到40％以上。后来，仓库主任、共产党员潘瑞领导职工改进了生猪的饲养保管工作，使生猪死亡率逐年降低，但还没有消灭死亡现象。今年，这个仓库实行了分品种饲养和分栏经济核算的方法，进一步提高了饲养保管人员的积极性。饲养员们不但发扬了过去工作中的优点，而且创造了许多新的经验。大部分饲养员学会了医疗病猪的方法。青年团员彭友才创造“细喂、勤添、少放、先稀后浓”的饲养方法，他喂养的猪很少生病，长肉最多的猪每天长肉二斤，创造了这个仓库的最新纪录。
