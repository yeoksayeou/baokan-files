The subscription plans of the broad masses of workers, staff, and military officers have all been overfulfilled. Farmers enthusiastically subscribed to the national public bonds during the vigorous upsurge of agricultural cooperation. Currently, some areas have completed the estimated sales figures ahead of schedule, while others are still in the process of promotion due to the harvest season. Encouraged by the joint state-private ownership of all industries, most industrialists and businessmen have purchased the public bonds.
