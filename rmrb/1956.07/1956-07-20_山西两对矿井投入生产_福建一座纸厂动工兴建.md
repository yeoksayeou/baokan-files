Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 17th. Recently, two newly built mines in the Ningwu and Qinshui coalfields in Shanxi Province were officially handed over for production. These two mines include the Huangjiapu adit of the Xuangang Coal Mine and the Huangshiban adit of the Yangquan Mining Bureau.

　　Both mines have relatively good mechanical equipment and complete safety and ventilation facilities.

　　These two mines will produce coking coal and coal for civilian use.

Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, 17th. Construction began on the 16th in the suburbs of Nanping City, upstream of the Minjiang River in Fujian Province, on a modern paper mill with a daily output of 200 tons.

　　The construction of this paper mill will be carried out in two phases, with all construction completed by 1958. The first phase of the project includes a mechanical wood pulp workshop, a paper-making workshop, a machine repair workshop, and staff dormitories, covering an area of 5,000 square meters. In addition, an artificial lake capable of holding 12,000 cubic meters of pine wood and a large tap water pool will be built in the valley near the factory. After the completion of this phase of the project in the fourth quarter of 1957 and its commissioning, it will be able to produce 33,000 tons of newsprint annually.

　　The raw material for papermaking in this paper mill is Masson pine. The counties near the factory are producing areas of Masson pine. Locally sourced materials will reduce costs.

    山西两对矿井投入生产
    福建一座纸厂动工兴建
    新华社太原17日电　在山西境内的宁武煤田和沁水煤田上，最近有两对新建成的矿井正式移交生产。这两对矿井中，一对是轩岗煤矿的黄甲堡平峒，一对是阳泉矿务局的黄石板平峒。
    这两对矿井都有比较好的机械设备，并且有完善的安全和通风设备。
    这两对矿井将生产炼焦用煤和民用煤。
    新华社福州17日电　一座日产二百吨的现代化造纸厂，十六日在福建省的闽江上游南平城郊动工兴建。
    这座造纸厂工程分两期进行，全部工程到1958年全部完成。第一期工程包括机械木浆车间、造纸车间、机修车间和职工宿舍等，占地面积达五千平方公尺；此外，还要在工厂附近的峡谷里建筑一个能容纳一万二千立方公尺松木的人造湖和一个大自来水池。这期工程在1957年第四季度完工投入生产以后，每年能产新闻纸三万三千吨。
    这座造纸厂的造纸原料，是马尾松。工厂附近各县是马尾松产地，就地取材，成本低廉。
