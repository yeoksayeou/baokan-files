Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, July 8th Dispatch: The Egyptian newspaper "Al-Ahram" wrote that Arab officials and people from all walks of life in Arab countries welcome the proposal of establishing a federal union between Egypt and Syria, considering it the first step towards uniting all Arab countries.

    "Al-Shaab" wrote that establishing the union will help the Arab peoples in their struggle to maintain peace in the Middle East, help promote the consolidation of national independence of Arab countries, and help them counter the pressure that imperialism has been exerting on them in order to drag them into foreign conventions.

    "Akhbar al-Youm" said: "We trust the alliance of Arab countries, and we believe that the unification of Arab countries will appear in the East... The day is coming when all barriers currently existing between Arab countries will be broken. We do not demand the establishment of an Arab empire or pursue imperialist policies. We only hope that the people who have been divided by imperialism will unite. We have no intention of aggression, but we will defend every inch of our land, and we are willing to sow the seeds of freedom, prosperity and peace on our land."

    埃及舆论赞成埃叙联盟
    认为是全体阿拉伯国家团结起来的第一步
    据新华社9日讯　塔斯社开罗8日消息：埃及“金字塔报”写道：阿拉伯官方人士和阿拉伯各国社会人士欢迎埃及和叙利亚建立联邦形式的联盟的主张，认为这是把全体阿拉伯国家联合起来的第一步。
    “人民报”写道，建立联盟将有助于阿拉伯各国人民维护中东和平的斗争，有助于促进阿拉伯各国民族独立的巩固，并且帮助它们反击帝国主义为了把它们拖入外国公约而一直在对它们施加的压力。
    “今日消息”说：“我们信任阿拉伯国家的联盟，我们相信，阿拉伯各国的统一将要在东方出现……打破阿拉伯各国之间目前的一切壁垒的日子就要到来了。我们不要求建立阿拉伯帝国或是奉行帝国主义政策。我们只希望被帝国主义分裂的人民团结起来。我们没有侵略打算，但是我们将保卫我们每一寸土地，我们愿意在我们土地上播下自由、繁荣和和平的种子。”
