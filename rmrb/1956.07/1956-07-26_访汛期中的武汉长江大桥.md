Visiting the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge During Flood Season

This year's annual flood arrived in Wuhan a month early. At its peak, the water level exceeded the level of the same period in 1954 by one meter and exceeded the level of the same period in 1955 by five meters. This brought many difficulties to the construction of the underwater pier foundations of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge, and even posed a danger to the most arduous No. 7 pier. However, the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge adopted the world's latest pier foundation construction method. The workers actively implemented various flood control measures, accelerated the pouring of underwater concrete, and strengthened the underwater foundations of each pier, ensuring that the bridge construction continued during the flood season. (Our Wuhan Reporter)

Foundation Construction Proceeds as Usual

The Yangtze River water level between Turtle Mountain and Snake Mountain has risen to twenty-six meters, but the underwater pier foundation construction of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge is still proceeding on a large scale. Around the island-like piers, huge floating cranes wave their thirty-meter-high steel arms, pile drivers spew thick white smoke, power boats and rock drills emit rhythmic sounds, and bridge builders safely carry out multi-trade joint labor on the water platforms.

This is the effect achieved by the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge using the world's latest pier foundation construction method – the caisson drilling method. According to the old "pneumatic caisson method," after the Yangtze River water level rose to twenty meters, the workers working underwater could not withstand it and had to stop work, and could only work for two or three months throughout the year. According to old workers who participated in the Qiantang River Bridge project in the past: the No. 4 "pneumatic caisson" of that bridge was washed away six or seven miles away by the rising river water because it was launched a little late, which not only delayed the construction period but also hindered water traffic. Now, with the "caisson drilling method," workers do not work underwater. No matter how high the river water rises, they only need to lengthen the caisson and raise the working platform. Hundreds of workers can safely carry out rock drilling, concrete pouring, and other work on the water to build underwater foundation projects.

Currently, three piers of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge have been built out of the water before the flood season, while piers No. 3 and No. 6 continue to be drilled, and pier No. 4 is also carrying out underwater mud suction and re-driving of steel sheet piles. (Ci Dong, Jiang Bo)

Pier No. 7 Out of Danger

The most arduous and complex No. 7 pier project of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge, after several consecutive days and nights of intense repairs by the workers, reached a height of sixteen meters on July 12, out of the dangerous situation, and stood like a rock in the rapid center of the river.

The geological conditions at the bottom of the river for pier No. 7 are the most complicated, and the construction method is also different from other piers. It uses the method of driving cement pipe piles to build the underwater foundation. At the same time, pier No. 7 is located in the mainstream of the Yangtze River, where the water is deepest and the flow is fastest. This year's flood arrived a month early, and the rapids formed a trough in front of pier No. 7, rushing against the pipe pile group, causing the pipe piles to shake violently. In June, the rapids washed away more than twenty steel sheet piles that had been inserted, and the situation was very urgent. According to calculations by Soviet experts and Chinese engineers: "If the river water rises to twenty-six meters and the flow rate reaches three meters per second, and pier No. 7 has not been built to a height of sixteen meters, there is a possibility of danger at any time." This would not only affect the early opening of the Yangtze River Bridge but also affect the completion of the Yangtze River Bridge in the short term. In this situation, everyone was urgently mobilized to close and seal the bottom of the steel sheet pile cofferdam of pier No. 7 in the early stage of the flood to get pier No. 7 out of the flood threat.

In order to pull out the steel sheet piles that had been washed away and re-insert them, loading and hoisting worker Ai Yunshu risked his life by sitting on a hook and pulley, rising to a height of more than thirty meters to release the lifting rope and remove the shackle. The people below were worried for him, but he still insisted on finishing the work before coming down. Two steel sheet piles were submerged more than one meter deep by the rapidly rising river water, and loading and hoisting workers Xu Linshan and Liu Xishan jumped into the rapids to tie the lifting rope and fasten the shackle. Divers also took turns working day and night at the bottom of the river. After the workers' vigorous and intense work, the steel sheet piles were finally closed on July 1.

In early July, the river water rose to 25.9 meters, only one centimeter away from the dangerous water level. The unit responsible for the construction of pier No. 7 immediately took emergency measures to continuously seal the bottom. The workers worked continuously for five days and nights in the scorching heat, completed the bottom sealing on the 12th, and built it to a height of sixteen meters, so that pier No. 7 was out of danger.

Steel Beams Extend Towards the River Surface

The brown-red steel beams of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge have been assembled for more than one hundred meters at the Turtle Mountain bridgehead and are gradually extending towards the river surface. Six riveting guns emit sounds like machine guns day and night. Workers are assembling the third "rice-shaped" joint.

Each hole of the steel beam of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge extends one hundred and twenty meters, which is thirteen point five eight meters longer than the entire Shanghai Waibaidu Bridge, the tallest bridge in Shanghai. Its rivets are eighty millimeters longer and three millimeters thicker than the largest ordinary rivets, making them very difficult to rivet. In addition, most of the bridge riveters are level three or four workers, with low technical levels, and there are many difficulties in their work. The riveting team led by Shen Yunqing learned the Kovalev working method, gave full play to each person's strengths, cooperated closely with each other, and ensured the quality of the rivets. When assembling the first "rice-shaped" joint, the workers used eighteen work shifts, and when assembling the second "rice-shaped" joint, it had been shortened to twelve and a half work shifts.

The bridge workers are very satisfied with the steel beams manufactured by the Shanhaiguan Bridge Factory. According to chief engineer Luo Qibin, this is the best quality steel beam he has encountered in ten years of work. (Ci Dong)

Protection Work During the Flood Season

A sixth-level northerly wind suddenly blew over the Yangtze River, and the "Deck 35" large floating crane and floating concrete factory parked next to pier No. 3 were immediately rolled up by the wind and waves and crashed into the caisson of the pier, damaging the working platform on the caisson. At this time, several small tugboats of the Bridge Engineering Bureau were rescuing other ships and were unable to spare any manpower. It looked like these two large ships were about to hit the cable pile and damage the power line.

The Bridge Engineering Bureau immediately asked the Yangtze River Shipping Bureau for assistance. The Yangtze River Shipping Bureau sent the No. 319 large tugboat, but it was already too late.

At this time, the "Shengji" and "Shengxiong" tugboats of the Minsheng Company passed by the bridge construction site, saw the request for assistance signal, and immediately quickly entered the dangerous situation, dragged the floating concrete factory to a safe area, and then turned around to assist the No. 319 tugboat to drag the "Deck 35" large floating crane away, protecting the safe construction of the pier.

Similar things are very easy to happen at the bridge construction site during the flood season. In order to ensure the safe construction of the Yangtze River Bridge during the flood season, the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge Engineering Bureau established flood control organizations at all levels since May and began to carry out protection work on the water and on the shore. They set up lookout posts equipped with special communication equipment in Wuchang Baishazhou and Hanyang Parrot Island, etc., and were on duty day and night. They sent two special ships to patrol frequently between the lookout posts and the construction site in order to detect bamboos, wood, and other debris drifting downstream as early as possible, drag them away, and prevent the piers from being damaged by these debris. Anchor chains, wooden floats, and light signals were also added around the piers under construction, and thousands of cubic meters of rubble were thrown down to reinforce the piers and make the targets clear. At the same time, they have blocked the culverts at the bridgeheads on the shore and blocked the breaches in the embankment at the construction site to a height of more than 27 meters. They also established pumping stations to drain accumulated water and prepared iron, wood, earth, stone, and other materials to block the breaches.

In addition, the bridge construction site also formulated emergency rescue signals, organized two water rescue squadrons and a rescue ship group, and rescue reserve teams were also established on both sides of the river to meet emergency needs.

All relevant units fully support the construction and protection work of the Yangtze River Bridge. Whenever bamboo and wood rafts pass through the bridge construction site, the Wuhan Bamboo and Wood Security Committee will notify the Bridge Engineering Bureau in advance and send special ships to escort them through the construction site. The Bridge Engineering Bureau can obtain the weather conditions for the next day and the rise and fall of the water levels of the upstream rivers from relevant units every day, and prepare for protection in a timely manner. In case of emergency, the Yangtze River Shipping Bureau will immediately send large ships to support the bridge. (Jiang Bo)

Technical Strength Grows Rapidly

The technical strength of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge Engineering Bureau is growing rapidly. Since the bridge began construction, more than 120 junior technicians have grown into excellent technicians and engineers, and many engineers have been able to independently design and organize construction. In the first half of this year, 41 technicians were promoted to engineers, 39 engineers were promoted and promoted, and 9 engineers were promoted to directors and deputy directors of various business divisions. Now, engineer Zhang Zongnai, who is in charge of the construction of a pier, was recently promoted. He was still a college student before 1953. In three years, the number of technical workers has also more than doubled. Recently, more than 2,000 workers have been upgraded to varying degrees, and five workers have been promoted to technicians. The technical level of the workers has been greatly improved. Now, the workers have been able to manufacture large-scale caissons and master complex technologies such as caisson sinking and rock drilling inside the caissons. (Hu Bo) (Attached picture)

    访汛期中的武汉长江大桥
    一年一度的洪水今年提前一个月来到武汉。水位最高的时候曾超过1954年同期水位一公尺，超过1955年同期水位五公尺。这就给正在修建水下桥墩基础的武汉长江大桥建设工程带来许多困难，甚至一度给最艰巨的七号桥墩造成危险。但是，武汉长江大桥采用了世界最新的桥墩基础施工方法，职工们又积极贯彻各项防汛措施，并提前和加速浇灌水下混凝土，加固各个桥墩的水下基础，保证了大桥工程在洪水期中继续施工。　（本报武汉记者）
    基础工程照常施工
    龟山和蛇山之间的长江水位已经涨到二十六公尺，武汉长江大桥的水下桥墩基础工程依然在大规模施工。在一座座小岛般的墩台周围，巨大的吊船挥动着三十公尺高的钢铁臂膀，打桩机喷吐出浓烈的白烟，发电船和钻岩机都发出有节奏的响声，建桥工人们安全地在水上的平台上进行着多工种的联合劳动。
    这是武汉长江大桥采用世界最新的桥墩基础施工方法——管柱钻孔法所获得的效果。按照旧有的“压气沉箱法”施工，长江水位涨到二十公尺后，在水底工作的工人身体就受不了，必须停工，全年只能施工两三个月。据过去参加钱塘江大桥工程的老工人谈：那座大桥的四号“压气沉箱”因为下水迟了一些，被上涨的江水冲走六七里远，不仅延误工期，而且妨碍水上交通。现在采用“管柱钻孔法”施工，工人不下水工作，无论江水上涨多高，只需将管柱接长些，工作平台升高些，数百名工人可以安全地在水上进行钻岩、浇灌混凝土等工作，来修筑水下基础工程。
    现在，武汉长江大桥已有三个桥墩在洪水期前修出水面，另有三号和六号桥墩在继续钻岩，四号桥墩也在进行水底吸泥和复打钢板桩的工作。　（慈栋、江波）
    七号桥墩脱离险境
    武汉长江大桥最艰巨、最复杂的七号桥墩工程，经过职工们连续几昼夜的紧张抢修，在七月十二日修筑到十六公尺的标高以后，脱离了危险境地，像盘石一样屹立在急流的江心。
    七号桥墩的江底地质情况最复杂，施工方法也同其他桥墩不同，是采用打水泥管桩的办法来修筑水下基础的。同时，七号桥墩正位于长江主流之中，水最深，流最急。今年的洪水提前一个月来到，激流在七号墩前形成了一道水槽，哗啦啦地冲击着管桩群，使管桩抖动得很厉害。六月里，激流的江水曾将插好的钢板桩冲垮了二十几块，形势非常紧急。据苏联专家和我国工程师计算：“如果江水涨到二十六公尺，流速达到每秒三公尺，七号桥墩还没有修到十六公尺的标高，随时都有发生危险的可能。”这不仅影响长江大桥提前通车，而且会影响长江大桥不能在短期内建成。在这种情况下，大家都紧急动员起来了，要在洪水初期将七号墩钢板桩围堰合拢并封底完毕，使七号墩摆脱洪水威胁。
    为了将冲开了的钢板桩拔起来再插下去，装吊工艾耘书冒着危险坐着吊勾壶芦，上升到三十多公尺的高空去解千斤绳和卸卡环。下面的人都为他捏了一把汗，而他仍然坚持将工作干完才下来。有两块钢板桩被迅速上涨的江水淹了一公尺多深，装吊工徐林山和刘喜山便跳到急流中去，栓好千斤绳，扣好卡环。潜水工们也轮流日夜潜入江底工作。经过职工们奋发紧张的工作，终于在七月一日将钢板桩合拢。
    七月初，江水涨到二十五点九公尺，离危险水位只差一公寸。负责七号墩施工的单位又立即采取连续封底的紧急措施。职工们在酷热中连续工作五个昼夜，在十二日封底完毕，并筑到十六公尺的标高，使七号墩脱离了险境。

    钢梁向江面伸展
    武汉长江大桥棕红色的钢梁，已在龟山桥头拼装了一百多公尺，正节节向江面伸展中。六部铆钉枪日夜发出像机关枪似的响声。工人们正在拚装第三个米字大接点。
    武汉长江大桥的钢梁每孔伸出一百二十公尺，比上海最高大的外白渡桥全桥还长十三点五八公尺。它的铆钉比一般最大的铆钉要长八十公厘，粗三公厘，很难铆接。加上大桥铆工多是三、四级工人，技术水平不高，工作困难很多。沈云清领导的铆工小组便学习郭瓦廖夫工作法，发挥各人的特长，互相密切配合，保证铆钉质量。拚装第一个米字大接点时，工人们用了十八个工班，拚装第二个米字大接点时，已缩短为十二个半工班。
    大桥职工们对山海关桥梁厂制造的钢梁很满意。据主管工程师罗其斌谈，这是他十年工作中遇到的质量最好的钢梁。　（慈栋）
    洪水期中的防护工作
    长江上突然刮起六级北风，停在三号墩旁的“德克35”大吊船和水上混凝土工厂，顿时被风浪卷起来，撞在桥墩的围囹上，把围囹上的工作平台撞坏了。这时，大桥工程局的几个小拖轮正在抢拖别的船只，分身不开，眼看这两艘大船就要碰到电缆桩上，把动力线碰坏。
    大桥工程局马上向长江航运局求援，长江航运局派了319号大拖轮来，但是已经来不及了。
    这时，民生公司的“生机”号和“生雄”号拖轮路过大桥工地，看见了求援信号，马上就快速驶入险境，将水上混凝土工厂拖到安全地带，然后又回过头来援助319号拖轮将“德克35”大吊船拖走，保护了桥墩安全施工。
    类似这样的事情，在洪水期间是很容易在大桥工地发生的。为了确保长江大桥在洪水期中安全施工，武汉长江大桥工程局从五月以来便成立了各级防汛组织，开始进行水上、岸上的防护工作。他们在武昌白沙洲和汉阳鹦鹉洲等地设立了备有专用通讯设备的了望哨，日夜值班了望。派了两只专用轮船经常在各个了望哨和工地之间巡逻，以便随时发现上游漂下的竹、木等杂物，及早拖走，防止桥墩被这些杂物冲坏。在正在施工的桥墩周围也增设了锚链、木浮和灯光讯号，并抛下了数千方片石，以加固桥墩，显明目标。同时，他们已将岸上的桥头函管堵死，将工地的江堤决口堵到标高27公尺以上。他们还建立了排除积水的抽水机站，并筹齐了堵决口的铁、木、土、石等材料。
    另外，大桥工地还制定了抢险讯号，组织了两个水中抢险中队和抢险船舶组，两岸也成立了抢险后备大队，以应紧急需要。
    对长江大桥的施工防护工作，各有关单位都全力支援。每当竹木排筏通过大桥工地时，武汉市竹木保安委员会都事先通知大桥工程局，并派专轮送过工地。大桥工程局每天都能从有关单位获得次日的气象情况和上游各河水位涨落情况，及时做好防护准备。遇有紧急情况，长江航运局便立即派大型船舶支援大桥。　（江波）
    技术力量迅速成长
    武汉长江大桥工程局的技术力量正迅速成长中。自大桥开始建设以来，有一百二十多名初级技术人员成长为优秀的技术员和工程师，有许多工程师已能独立进行设计和组织施工。今年上半年，有四十一名技术员升为工程师，有三十九名工程师晋级和升职，有九名工程师被提拔为各业务处正副处长。现在，正领导一个桥墩施工的张宗乃工程师，是新近才提拔的，他在1953年以前还是一个大学生。三年中，技术工人也增长了一倍多，最近有两千多个工人得到不同程度的升级，有五个工人被提升为技师。工人们的技术水平有了很大提高，现在，工人们已经能够制造大型管柱，能掌握围囹下沉和管柱内钻岩等复杂的技术。　（胡伯）（附图片）
