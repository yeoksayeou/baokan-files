American Goods in South Vietnam
Chen Hanzhang

Not long ago, a Saigon newspaper raised this question: "We have abundant mountain forests and trees, our fields yield plenty of rice, our rivers and seas teem with fish and shrimp, and underground mineral deposits are also rich. We have everything we need, so why do we import fish, shrimp, and timber at exorbitant prices? Why must even a nail be a foreign import?"

As if in answer to this question, the French bourgeois newspaper "Marchés Coloniaux" wrote: "The United States does not intend to use American aid to enable South Vietnamese capitalists to engage in production and management but prefers them to purchase and sell American goods." The newspaper pointed out that South Vietnam's economy has become "a precarious and unstable economy subordinate to the United States."

Since July 1954, when the United States supported the Ngo Dinh Diem clique to rule South Vietnam, the United States has, on the one hand, instructed the Ngo Dinh Diem government to refuse to implement the Geneva Accords, obstructing Vietnam's general elections and unification. On the other hand, the United States has replaced France's former colonial rule, controlling all sectors of South Vietnam's economy and dealing a fatal blow to the local economy.

Rubber is one of the main resources of South Vietnam. Before the war, it accounted for a quarter of Indochina's total exports. In 1955, South Vietnam exported 62,000 tons of rubber, accounting for 80% of its total foreign trade income. However, since the end of 1955, the United States has exported 30,000 tons of synthetic rubber to South Vietnam, forcing high-priced sales under the guise of "aid." A Saigon newspaper complained: "It only takes one kilogram of rubber, worth 18 piastres (South Vietnamese currency), to make a bicycle tire, but now we have to spend 190 piastres to buy it from abroad. Isn't that heartbreaking?" At the same time, the United States also wants to curb the sales of South Vietnamese rubber by using "embargoes." Under such a two-pronged attack, the price of South Vietnam's natural rubber fell to 16.7 piastres per kilogram in May of this year, a 64% decrease from the 46 piastres in July of last year. Many rubber plantations have been forced to stop production.

All kinds of American surplus agricultural products have flooded the South Vietnamese market. Southern Vietnam is originally rich in fruits. The olives of Sa Dec and My Tho, the mangoes of Thu Dau Mot, the coconuts of Ben Tre and Binh Dinh, etc., are not only high in yield but also taste good. However, in December 1955 alone, South Vietnam imported 1,787 tons of fruit from the United States. South Vietnam's aquatic products are also abundant. In Rach Gia province, it is said that a fishing net can catch nearly 100 kilograms of fish every night. However, in 1955, the United States exported 3,143 tons of canned fish and meat to South Vietnam. Even American vegetables and potatoes have become imported goods in South Vietnam. The import volume of these two types of goods in 1955 was 19,317 tons and 9,395 tons, respectively.

American surplus rice has also been sold to South Vietnam. Southern Vietnam has always been known as the "granary of Southeast Asia." Before World War II, Vietnam's average annual rice production reached 6 million tons, of which 2 million tons were exported. However, the current situation is very different. The United States instructed the Ngo Dinh Diem government to carry out the so-called "land reform," depriving farmers of the land they had gained during the war of resistance. Land became more concentrated in the hands of landlords, and the exploitation of farmers became even more severe, with rents increasing by an average of 15% to 20%. Agricultural production has been severely hit. In 1955, rice production fell to 2.1 million tons, almost only one-third of the pre-war level. From May 1955 to March 1956, rice prices increased fivefold. South Vietnam was forced to buy rice from the United States and Thailand to relieve the famine.

Not to mention industrial products. The dumping of American surplus goods and goods from Japan and West Germany, such as cloth, silk, cigarettes, canned goods, sugar, etc., to South Vietnam has caused a large number of South Vietnam's original small-scale industries and handicrafts to collapse and go bankrupt. According to the Saigon "Chung Sheng Bao" on May 8, 1956, "Due to the high cost of raw materials and the competition of American goods, 40% of the total number of 3,301 looms have enough raw cotton and silk, and 60% are forced to completely stop production or carry out limited production."

While the United States is hitting the industry and agriculture of Southern Vietnam, it is vigorously cultivating comprador merchants. According to Nguyen Ngoc Tho, the Minister of Economy of the Ngo Dinh Diem government, there are now 20,000 merchants engaged in import and export trade in South Vietnam, which is an unprecedented number.

In the first quarter of 1956, South Vietnam imported goods worth 1.963 billion piastres, while exports were only 446 million piastres, with a trade deficit of 1.517 billion piastres. Exports were less than a quarter of imports. Compared with the same quarter last year, the export value has decreased by another 26%. This fully reflects the serious situation of South Vietnam's economy being on the verge of bankruptcy.

The proportion of American goods in the total import value of South Vietnam accounted for only 7.8% in 1954, but it has risen to 23% in the first quarter of this year. In addition, a large number of American goods are shipped to the South Vietnamese market for dumping under the guise of so-called "aid" without going through trade. The American currency has also replaced the French franc in dominating South Vietnam, constantly creating waves in the market. Last January, one US dollar was exchanged for 55 piastres, but this May it rose to 84 piastres.

The rampant influx of American goods, the collapse of production, and the high prices have further reduced the living standards of the people in Southern Vietnam. Unemployment and hunger seriously threaten the working people. A Saigon newspaper controlled by the Ngo Dinh Diem clique also said: "Poverty threatens the workers on the plantations," "One hundred thousand textile workers face the danger of complete unemployment." According to South Vietnamese newspaper materials, the current number of unemployed people in South Vietnam is 1.5 million.

The people and patriots of Southern Vietnam have expressed increasingly strong resistance to American colonial enslavement. In May 1956 alone, the number of strikers in South Vietnam reached 27,000. On this year's "May Day" International Labor Day, 200,000 people in Saigon-Cholon held a parade, demanding peaceful reunification of the motherland and limiting the import of foreign goods to develop domestic industry. This is a powerful demonstration by the South Vietnamese people against American colonialism. (Attached picture)

### 美国商品在南越

    美国商品在南越
    陈汉章
    不久以前，西贡的一家报纸提出了这样一个问题：“我们的山林树木多，我们的田地谷米多，我们的河海鱼虾多，地下的矿藏也丰富，一切应有尽有，然而为什么要以勒脖子的价钱进口鱼虾和木材，甚至一根洋钉也要用洋货？”
    好像是回答这个问题，法国资产阶级报纸“殖民地市场报”写道：“美国不打算用美援让南越资本家从事生产经营，而愿让他们购售美国货。”这个报纸指出：南越的经济，已成为“一种隶属于美国的朝不保夕的不稳定的经济”。
    自从1954年7月美国扶植吴庭艳集团统治南越以来，美国一面指使吴庭艳政府拒绝履行日内瓦协议，阻挠越南的普选和统一；另一方面，美国又取代法国过去的殖民统治地位，控制了南越经济的各个部门，给当地的经济以致命的打击。
    橡胶是越南南部主要富源之一，战前占印度支那出口总值的四分之一。1955年，南越输出橡胶六万二千吨，占对外贸易总收入的80％。但自1955年年底到现在，美国却向南越输出了三万吨人造橡胶，以“援助”为名强迫高价推销。一家西贡报纸发牢骚说：“作一副自行车胎只需要价值十八皮阿斯特（南越货币名）的一公斤橡胶，可是现在要花一百九十皮阿斯特向外国购买，难道这还不令人痛心吗？”同时，美国还要以“禁运”来扼制南越橡胶的销路。在这样两面夹攻之下，南越的天然橡胶价格在今年五月跌到每公斤16.7皮阿斯特，比去年七月的四十六皮阿斯特降低了64％，不少橡胶园已经被迫停止生产。
    各式各样的美国剩余农产品都涌到南越市场上。越南南部本来是盛产水果的。沙沥和美萩的橄榄、土龙木的芒果、槟椥和平定的椰子等，不仅产量高，而且味道好，可是，仅在1955年12月，南越就自美国进口了1，787吨水果。南越的水产也丰富，在迪石省，据说，一个吊网每晚可以捕获近百公斤的鱼，而1955年，美国却向南越输出了3，143吨鱼肉罐头。甚至美国的蔬菜和马铃薯也成了南越进口的货物。这两类商品在1955年的进口量分别为19，317吨和9，395吨。
    美国的剩余大米也销到南越来了。越南南部一直以“东南亚的谷仓”著称。第二次世界大战前，越南大米平均年产量达六百万吨，其中有二百万吨出口。但是，现在的情况已大非昔比。美国指使吴庭艳政府进行所谓“土地改革”，剥夺了农民在抗战期间分得的土地。土地更加集中到地主手里，农民所受的剥削更加沉重，地租平均增加15％到20％。农业生产受到了重大打击。在1955年，产米量降到二百一十万吨，差不多只及战前的三分之一。从1955年5月到1956年3月，米价上涨了五倍。南越被迫从美国和泰国买进大米来救济粮荒。
    工业品方面更不用说了。美国剩余商品和日本、西德的商品，像布匹、丝绸、香烟、罐头、糖等向南越倾销的结果，使南越原有的小型工业和手工业大量地倒闭和破产。据1956年5月8日西贡“钟声报”报道：“由于原料昂贵和美国货的竞争，在总数为3，301架织布机中，有40％有足用的原料棉纱和丝，有60％被迫完全停止生产或进行有限度的生产。”
    美国一面打击越南南方的工农业，同时却大力培植买办商人。据吴庭艳政府的经济部长阮玉诗说，南越从事进出口贸易的商人现在有两万人，这是空前未有的数目。
    在1956年第一季度，南越进口商品共值十九亿六千三百万皮阿斯特，而出口只有四亿四千六百万皮阿斯特，入超达十五亿一千七百万皮阿斯特。出口不及进口的四分之一。和去年同一季度比较，出口值又下降了26％。这就充分反映了南越经济濒于破产的严重情况。
    美国货在南越进口总值中所占的比重，在1954年只占7.8％，而今年第一季度已上升到23％。另外还有大量的美国货不通过贸易而以所谓“援助”为名运到南越市场上倾销。美国的货币也代替了法国的法郎宰制着南越，不断在市场上兴风作浪。去年一月，一美元换五十五皮阿斯特，而今年五月涨到了八十四皮阿斯特。
    美货泛滥、生产倒闭、物价高涨，使得越南南部人民的生活水平更加降低，失业和饥饿严重地威胁着劳动人民。吴庭艳集团控制下的一家西贡报纸也这样说：“贫困威胁着种植园的工人”，“十万纺织工人面临着完全失业的危险”。据南越报纸的材料，南越目前失业人数达150万人。
    越南南部人民和爱国人士，对美国的殖民奴役已表示越来越强烈的反抗。仅在1956年5月份，南越罢工的人数就有二万七千人。在今年“五一”国际劳动节，西贡—堤岸有二十万人举行游行，要求和平统一祖国和限制外货进口，发展国内工业。这就是南越人民对美国殖民主义者的一次有力的示威。（附图片）
