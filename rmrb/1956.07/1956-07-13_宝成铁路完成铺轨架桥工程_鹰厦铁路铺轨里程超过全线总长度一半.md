    Baocheng Railway Completes Track Laying and Bridge Construction
    Yingxia Railway's Track Laying Mileage Exceeds Half of the Total Length
    (Our Newspaper) On July 12th, at 16:50, the track laying and bridge construction of the last major bridge of the Baocheng Railway, the Huangsha River Bridge, was fully completed. On the 13th, the Baocheng Railway will be connected at Huangsha River in Huixian County, Gansu.
    Thus, the entire track laying and bridge construction of the Baocheng Railway, which runs through the Northwest and Southwest, with a total length of approximately 670 kilometers, has been completed. The dashed line on the map for decades has become a solid line.
    Together with the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway, which was completed as early as 1952, the two major lines, with a total length of more than 1,170 kilometers from north to south, have been connected to the Longhai Railway and the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway, which is advancing westward. The completion of the Baocheng Railway has connected the Southwest with all regions of the country.
    In order to meet the urgent needs of transportation, the sections of the Baocheng Railway that have not yet opened for transport operations are actively preparing for temporary operations.
    Since June, the Baocheng Railway line has been experiencing continuous rainfall. In order to complete the railway as soon as possible, the workers have been working in the rain with high morale. During the construction of the Huangsha River Bridge, the workers of the track laying and bridge construction team used a rapid bridge erection method, completing the six-span steel beams on the nearly 200-meter-long bridge in only a dozen hours, creating a new record for steel beam erection since the start of construction on the northern section of the Baocheng Railway.

    Xinhua News Agency, Yingxia Railway Construction Site, July 12th. The track laying project of the Yingxia Railway is advancing rapidly towards Yong'an County in Fujian Province. On the 11th, the track had been laid to a location more than 378 kilometers from Yingtan, exceeding half of the total length of the Yingxia Railway's main and branch lines.
    Xinhua News Agency, Yingxia Railway Construction Site, July 12th. At 5:00 AM on the 10th, a track laying team of the Railway Corps of the Chinese People's Liberation Army began laying tracks outside Waiyang Village, the starting point of the Waiyang-Nanping branch line of the Yingtan-Xiamen Railway.
    This branch line is more than 23 kilometers long and will connect the Yingxia Railway with the Nanping-Fuzhou Railway (formerly known as the Nanping-Shentou Railway).
    On the construction site, filled with the strong creosote smell of new sleepers, pairs of steel rails produced by Anshan Iron and Steel Company were placed one after another on the new line. The clanging sound of rail pulling and track nailing, and the roaring sound of the track laying train advancing, broke the tranquility of the quiet mountain village in the morning. Cinematographers were busy filming the moving scenes of the soldiers enthusiastically laying tracks.
    The weather was very hot, and women from nearby mountain villages continuously brought tea to the construction site for the soldiers to drink.
    The track quickly stretched forward. The rail pulling team led by Communist Party members Li Shude and Ding Chengquan used sixteen minutes to pull the first car of steel rails, and quickly reduced the time to only ten to twelve minutes to pull a car.
    The branch line track is about to cross the Sha Creek, a tributary of the Min River, and advance towards Nanping.

    宝成铁路完成铺轨架桥工程
    鹰厦铁路铺轨里程超过全线总长度一半
    本报讯　七月十二日十六时五十分，宝成铁路最后一座大桥——黄沙河大铁桥的铺轨架桥工程全部完成。十三日，宝成铁路即将在甘肃徽县境内黄沙河接轨了。
    至此，贯通西北和西南全长约六百七十公里的宝成铁路，已经完成全部铺轨架桥工程。几十年来，在地图上画着的虚线已经变成了实线。
    连同早在1952年已经建成的成渝铁路，南北共长1，170多公里的两大干线已经和陇海铁路以及正在向西挺进的兰新铁路相接。由于宝成铁路的建成，已经把西南和全国各地区连结起来。
    为了满足运输的迫切需要，现在宝成铁路还未开办运输营业的地段，正在积极进行临时营业的准备工作。
    六月份以来，宝成铁路沿线阴雨连绵，工人们为了早日把铁路修通，浴雨工作，情绪非常高涨。铺轨架桥队的工人，在架设黄沙河大桥的过程中，运用了快速架梁法，只用了十几个钟头，就架完了这座长近二百公尺的大桥上的六孔钢梁，创造了宝成铁路北段开工以来架设钢梁的新纪录。　（田庆丰）
    新华社鹰厦铁路工地12日电鹰厦铁路铺轨工程快速向福建省永安县城方向前进。十一日已铺轨到离鹰潭378公里多的地点，超过鹰厦铁路干线、支线总长度的一半。
    新华社鹰厦铁路工地12日电十日早晨五点钟，中国人民解放军铁道兵部队的一支铺轨队，在鹰潭—厦门铁路的外洋—南平支线的起点外洋村外开始铺轨。
    这条支线长二十三公里多，它将使鹰厦铁路和南平—福州铁路（以前称南平—?头铁路）互相连接起来。
    在散发着新枕木浓厚的重气油味的工地上，鞍山钢铁公司出产的钢轨一对接着一对被放到新线上去。拉轨、钉道的叮当声和铺轨列车前进的轰隆声，冲破了宁静的山村的早晨。电影摄影师忙着把战士们热情高涨地铺轨的动人场景拍摄下来。
    天气非常炎热，附近山村的妇女们不断地把茶水送到工地给战士们饮用。
    轨道迅速向前伸展。共产党员李树德、丁成全领导的拉轨组，拉出第一车钢轨时用了十六分钟，跟着很快地把时间缩短为只要十分钟到十二分钟就拉一车。
    支线轨道即将跨过闽江支流沙溪河，向南平推进。
