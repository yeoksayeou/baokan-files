    The Tradition of the National People's Congress
    Chu Anping

    The National People's Congress has convened three times. Through its annual sessions, it is gradually establishing its own traditions. We see two traditions emerging. One is that the deputies to the National People's Congress, through their own work, inspections, and observations, express their views on major national policies, offer criticisms of the government's work, and reflect the opinions of the people. The other is that responsible personnel of state organs report on their work to the Congress and, through the Congress, to the entire nation. Especially in this year's session, both of these points have made an exceptionally vivid impression on people.

    At this year's National People's Congress, more deputies than in the previous two sessions have offered frank, in-depth, and even sharp opinions on the government's work based on their actual experiences. All speeches that were substantive, based on facts, and sharply worded were met with enthusiastic applause from the Congress. This shows that the Congress welcomes such speeches, considering their attitude to be positive and patriotic, and helpful for improving the government's work. On the other hand, the leading and responsible personnel of state organs spoke at this year's Congress with more detail and thoroughness than in the past. This year, twenty-eight heads of various central departments reported to the Congress seriously and earnestly on the work of their respective departments over the past year. In addition to continuing to expound on our country's foreign policy to domestic and foreign audiences through the Congress, as he had done in the past two years, Premier Zhou also made a second speech this year, providing instructions and explanations on some important domestic issues. Vice Premier Chen Yun also made a second speech at this year's Congress, mainly offering explanations and responses to the speeches of some deputies at this session. Their repeated speeches demonstrate the Party and government's responsibility and importance placed on the National People's Congress and the National People's Representatives.

    At this year's Congress, some other new atmospheres also appeared. In terms of the method of speaking, there were several joint speeches this year. Some were joint speeches because they worked in the same location, some were joint speeches because they belonged to the same profession, and some were joint speeches because they went to the same place for inspection. This joint speech method was also welcomed by the Congress. One advantage of this speech method is that it can correspondingly streamline the speaking time of the Congress. Another advantage is that the content of the speech is more solid due to the collective discussion of several people. The emergence of the joint speech method reflects the flexibility and ease of the Congress activities. This joint speech method may be adopted more often in the future. In terms of the rhetoric of the speeches, more humorous, meaningful, and witty language appeared in this year's Congress. Those elegant and playful insertions often brought a light and lively atmosphere to the venue. At the same time, these humorous words will also indirectly have some enlightening effect on changing the general writing style of the current society.

    The above-mentioned new phenomena give people a general impression that this year's National People's Congress was more democratic, more genuine, more active, and more united. The reason why it was able to be like this is that, on the one hand, our people's congress system is becoming more mature and more perfect year by year through its practice. Another reason is that the policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend" proposed by the Party and Chairman Mao has been reflected in this conference imperceptibly. The National People's Congress is an advanced and exemplary deliberative forum in our country. It is completely reasonable and appropriate that the spirit of "Let a hundred flowers bloom" and "Let a hundred schools of thought contend" should be reflected first in the National People's Congress.

    Based on the experience of the three previous conferences, I believe that: First, the future National People's Congress will definitely be more brilliant; in particular, its democratic spirit will be given greater play. Recently, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China proposed the policy of "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision between the Communist Party and the democratic parties." According to the spirit of this policy, the National People's Congress, which represents the people of the whole country, should be able to reflect the opinions of the people more widely in the future, and further put forward more and better suggestions and criticisms on the work of the government. Although this year's conference was better than the previous two, everyone's ideological preparation for speaking frankly may still be insufficient and not universal. I believe that the National People's Congress next year and in the years to come will definitely be more active, richer, and more in line with the hopes and demands of the people.

    Second, the responsible personnel of state organs using the method of speaking at the conference to report their work of the past year to the conference representatives and through the conference to the people of the whole country is a very good method. This method should be maintained well, making it a system and a solid tradition. I believe that, starting from next year, it can be considered that after the representatives' speeches are over, in addition to the Premier or Vice Premier, if necessary, making some guiding explanations on the current policies and guidelines or other important issues, the heads of various government departments should make a response to the business of their department based on the speeches of the conference representatives.

    Third, I suggest that the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress consider whether to establish such a system: After each conference is closed, the Standing Committee, based on a certain part of the speeches in the conference, conducts appropriate investigations to those places or units mentioned in those speeches, in order to understand whether the situation reflected in some speeches is completely in accordance with the facts; whether the relevant places or units have already corrected, improved or solved some shortcomings and problems reflected in the speeches; if the representatives have made some suggestions to the relevant parties, whether those suggestions are feasible, and if they are feasible, whether they have been adopted and implemented? Then, the results of the understanding are either reported to the representative who spoke, or published publicly in the newspaper, so that these speeches are not only finished after speaking for a while at the conference, but also further generate more practical effects.

    If the above-mentioned second and third points can be achieved, it can make all aspects of the country pay more attention to the inspections and suggestions of the National People's Representatives, and at the same time, it can greatly encourage the enthusiasm of the National People's Representatives, so that they will go through more thinking, more investigations and research, and more contact with the masses before speaking, in order to make their speeches have a greater positive effect on the country, and make the National People's Congress, as a new type of political system, more perfectly create its characteristics and functions.

    全国人民代表大会的传统
    储安平
    全国人民代表大会已经开过三次。通过一年一次的大会，它正在逐步奠定它自己的传统。我们看到有两个传统正在育长之中。一个是全国人民代表大会的代表，通过他们自己的业务、视察和见闻，在大会上对国家大政陈述主张，对政府工作提出批评，并反映人民群众的意见。另一个是国家机关的负责人员向大会并通过大会向全国人民报告他们的工作。特别在今年召开的大会里，这两点都给人们以异常鲜明的印象。
    在今年的全国人民代表大会上，比过去两次的大会，有更多的代表根据他们的实际接触对政府工作提出了坦率的、深入的、甚至尖锐的意见。凡是内容踏实的、根据事实的、言辞锐利的发言，一致受到大会热烈的鼓掌。这说明大会欢迎这样一些发言，认为这些发言的态度是积极的、爱国的，对于改进政府工作是有帮助的。在另一方面，国家机关的领导人员和负责人员今年在大会上发言，比过去更细致周详。今年有二十八位中央各部门的负责人向大会认真严肃地报告了各该部门一年来的工作。周总理除了仍像过去两年一样、通过大会向国内外阐述了我国的外交政策以外，今年又作了第二次发言，就当前国内的一些重要问题作了指示和说明。陈云副总理在今年的大会上也作了第二次发言，主要是对本次大会上一部分代表的发言，提出了解释和答复。他们的重复发言，说明了党和政府对全国人民代表大会和全国人民代表的负责和重视。
    在今年的大会上，还出现了另外一些新气氛。在发言的方式上，今年出现了好几次联合发言。有的是因为在同一个地点工作而联合发言的，有的是因为同属一种职业而联合发言的，有的是因为同到一个地方去视察而联合发言的。这种联合发言的方式也受到大会的欢迎。这种发言方式的一个好处是可以因此相应地精简了大会发言的时间，另一个好处是由于经过几个人的集体讨论，发言的内容更为结实。联合发言方式的出现反映了大会活动的灵活和自如。这种联合发言的方式在今后可能会更多地被采用。在发言的辞藻上，今年大会里出现了较多幽默的、隽永的、饶有风趣的语言。那些典雅的、谑而不虐的穿插经常给会场带来轻快和活跃的气氛。同时，这些风趣的言辞对于改变当前社会上的一般文风，也会间接发生一些启发作用。
    上述这些新的事象给人们一个总的印象是：今年的全国人民代表大会开得更民主、更真切、更活跃、更团结。所以能够这样，一个原因是，我国的人民代表大会制度通过它的实践，正一年比一年成熟，一年比一年完美。另一个原因是，党和毛主席所提出的
  “百花齐放、百家争鸣”的方针，无形中已经在这次大会上反映了出来。全国人民代表大会是我们国家中的先进的示范的议事论坛。“百花齐放”和“百家争鸣”的精神首先在全国人民代表大会上反映出来，是完全合理的、应该的。
    根据已经开过三次大会的经验来看，我认为：第一，以后的全国人民代表大会一定会开得更光芒灿烂；特别是它的民主精神一定会得到更大的发扬。最近中共中央提出了“共产党和民主党派长期共存、互相监督”的方针。按照这个方针的精神推论，代表全国人民的全国人民代表大会以后应该能够更广泛地反映人民群众的意见，更进一步地对政府的工作提出更多更好的建议和批评。今年的大会虽然开得比过去两次好，但大家对于坦率发言的思想准备可能还是不够，不普遍的。我相信，明年和明年以后的全国人民代表大会，一定会开得更活跃、更丰富、更符合于人民的希望和要求。
    第二，国家机关的负责人员运用在大会发言的方式，向大会代表并通过大会向全国人民报告他们一年来的工作，这是一个非常好的办法。这个办法应当好好地保持下来，使它成为一种制度，成为一种牢固的传统。我认为，从明年起，可以考虑在代表发言结束以后，除了由总理或副总理，假如有必要，就当前的政策方针或其他重要问题作一些指导性的说明以外，政府各部门的负责人应当根据大会代表的发言，就本部门的业务作一次答复。
    第三，我建议全国人民代表大会常务委员会考虑，是否可以建立这样一个制度：每次大会闭幕以后，常务委员会根据大会发言中的某一部分发言，向那些发言中所提到的某些地方或单位，进行适当的调查，以便了解某些发言中所反映的情况是否完全符合事实；发言中所反映的某些缺点和问题，有关地方或单位是否已经或正在加以纠正、改善或解决；假如代表们曾经向有关方面作了一些建议，那些建议是否可行，假如可行，是否已被采纳并执行？然后再把了解的结果，或者报告那位发言的代表，或者在报上公开发表，使这些发言不仅仅是在大会上讲了一阵就完事，还能进一步发生更实际的效用。
    假如上述第二第三两点能够做到，就可以使全国各方面更重视全国人民代表的视察和建议，同时可以更大地鼓励全国人民代表的积极性，使他们在发言以前，将经过更多的思索、更多的调查研究，更多地联系群众，以便使自己的发言对国家发生更大的积极作用，并使全国人民代表大会，作为一种新型的政治制度来说，更完美地创造出它的特点和作用。
