    四千多种日用工业品在京展出
    用好坏对比的方法推动各厂提高产品质量
    新华社7日讯　一个规模较大的日用工业品质量展览会今天在北京苏联展览馆开幕。
    这个展览会是轻工业部、化学工业部、食品工业部、纺织工业部、商业部共同举办的。展览品共有四千多种、一万六千件，包括日用百货和文化用品、纺织品（各种纤维织品和针棉织品）、药品和医疗器械、交通电工器材、民用五金等五个部分，另外还有进口样品陈列室和商业事故陈列室。
    这个展览会的目的是通过好坏产品对比的方法，推动生产部门不断地提高产品质量，降低成本，增加品种，特别是迅速改变目前某些产品质量低劣的严重状况；并促使商业部门不断改进商品的保管、运输工作，以适应人民日益增长的需要。在陈列的展品中，有质量好的产品和新产品，有质量一向低劣的产品，也有原来质量不好现在已有改进的产品和原来质量较好现在质量反而下降的产品。这些展品都是从全国各地送来的六万多件产品中挑选出来的，并且经过了初步的鉴定，一部分还作了物理性能和化学分析的试验。展览会用生动的事实揭露了质量低劣的产品对消费者和国家造成的损害情况。
    这个展览会将有计划地组织各机关、工厂、企业职工和全国各省、市工商有关单位代表前来参观，从这里吸取经验教训。但不接待个人参观。
