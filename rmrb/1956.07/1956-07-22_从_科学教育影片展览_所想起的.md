    Reflections on the "Science Education Film Exhibition"
    Hong Lin, Director of Shanghai Scientific Education Film Studio

    In my hand, I have a letter that I just received. This letter was written by a young man. He said, "The Party and the Youth League call on us young people to study culture and march towards science. In addition to responding to this call in practical action, we also hope to learn some scientific knowledge from movies. But it is currently difficult for us to see such science education films. I don't understand: Why don't filmmakers produce more science education films? Why don't distribution companies distribute more of these films? Don't they like these films?"

    This question is very reasonable. We usually don't see many science education films. To say that people only like to watch feature films and don't like to watch science education films is not in accordance with the facts. People's cultural life is multifaceted. Just as a person can have both literary magazines and science popularization publications on their desk, people in movie theaters or clubs do not only want to see "Dong Cunrui" but also "The Origin of Life." Recently, the number of people subscribing to science magazines, listening to science lectures, and reading science and technology books has been increasing day by day, which shows that everyone wants to acquire more knowledge and is interested in science and technology issues. Although not everyone is engaged in scientific research, people understand that humanity is on the eve of a new technological revolution and want to know some scientific and technological issues and are eager to improve their cultural and scientific level.

    Taking many of the films in this "Science Education Film Exhibition" as an example, "Cultivating Strong Seedlings" introduces Chen Yongkang's important experience in high-yield rice, "Artificial Pollination of Corn" promotes this method of promoting corn yield, "The Function of the Cerebral Cortex and the Organism" and "For Humanity" popularly and vividly introduce Pavlov's materialistic theory of higher nervous activity, "The Growth and Development of Plants" and "Flowers" tell us some basic knowledge of plant growth, as well as other films on preventing pests and diseases such as "Prevention and Control of Cotton Aphids," "Preventing Chicken Plague," and films introducing the mechanization of Soviet agriculture such as "Mechanization of Grain Cultivation" and "Comprehensive Mechanization of Cotton." Don't people like to watch these films? Don't people know that increasing this knowledge is very beneficial to themselves?

    At present, the production of science education films is more than before, and several high-quality films have also been produced (such as "Contract System in Agricultural Production Cooperatives," "Freshwater Fish Farming," "Artificial Pollination of Corn," "Cultivating Strong Seedlings," etc.); some improvements have also been made in distribution work, such as the establishment of cinemas specializing in short films in several cities; these are all welcomed by the vast audience. China's science education is progressing and developing. However, it is also a fact that the current science education films, whether in production or distribution, cannot meet the requirements of the vast audience, especially the new situation after marching towards science.

    In terms of film production, in addition to the small quantity, we also feel that the subject matter is very narrow. For example, we have filmed very few films introducing scientific research activities, films on basic scientific knowledge suitable for general cadres, and educational films on history, geography, and culture. We have not yet touched on films introducing China's ancient scientific achievements, science common sense films for children, and science fiction films. In terms of film structure, a fixed formula has also been formed: eliminating pests is always "one life history, two harms, and three prevention and control methods." Many films have the problem of being obscure, difficult to understand, and boring. Things that are vivid in nature, phenomena that people often encounter in their daily lives, become lifeless, flat, and dull in the films. Therefore, in the current production of science education films, the output urgently needs to be increased, the scope of subject matter urgently needs to be expanded, and the quality urgently needs to be improved, so as to produce more and better films for the vast audience.

    We have not done enough to strive for the more active participation of scientific workers in science education film work. Although in the films produced this year, more than half of the scripts were written by comrades engaged in science and technology in various departments, and almost every film has experts and technicians as consultants and technical guidance, the difference between science education films and other types of films is that they must be produced under the closest cooperation between film workers and scientific workers. When the Soviet Union was producing "The Origin of Life," it received the help of many famous scientists and experts, such as Oparin and Lepeshinskaya, who directly participated in the production of this film. We can imagine that without the assistance of scientific workers, only relying on film workers, it would not be possible to make such a scientific film. Striving for more scientific workers in our country to write scripts for science education films, serve as consultants and provide specific guidance should be the key to improving the quality of science education films. We believe that in addition to science popularization films, China should also have scientific research films that record the research activities of scientists or are made for the purpose of studying a certain scientific problem. In this way, more cooperation between scientific departments and film studios is needed.

    As for the distribution of science education films, there are currently many problems. For example, many films have very few copies printed, and it takes a long time to circulate among the national screening units. And these few copies may not be appropriately and fully utilized. The past situation of screening films on mosquito and fly eradication during the Spring Festival is now rare, but the phenomenon of not differentiating films with different content and distributing them to different regions and different audiences still exists. A viewer in Shaanxi once said: "Our village only screened 'Li Xikui's Shunting Method' once, but the masses here don't even know what a train looks like. This area is a producer of grains and miscellaneous grains. Why not show farmers films such as 'Artificial Pollination of Corn' and 'Prevention and Control of Cotton Aphids'?" Some viewers also criticized: "Science education films often sleep in warehouses, affecting the exertion of their function." Up to now, China has produced more than 60 science education films, and more than 100 science education films have been translated from the Soviet Union and other people's democratic countries. The content included here is very broad. Almost every department in industry, various important crops in agriculture, as well as physiology, hygiene, physical exercise, basic scientific knowledge, culture, and art, all have a few available films to some extent. How to let areas with serious insect pests see films on pest control, let aquatic areas see films on fish farming, let construction workers see films on construction, let rural women see films on new midwifery methods, let athletes see films on gymnastics and swimming, let young art workers see films on Tolstoy's manuscripts... and make it convenient for them to watch these films and deliver them to their front, these are indeed not easy things, but they are indeed problems that the audience urgently needs to solve.

    The "Science Education Film Exhibition" has begun. Through this exhibition, more people will be willing to befriend science education films and will be willing to see these films often, so as to obtain some scientific knowledge, expand their horizons, and inspire interest in further studying this knowledge.

    We warmly welcome the holding of this "Science Education Film Exhibition," and we also warmly look forward to improvements in the production and distribution of science education films.

### 从“科学教育影片展览”所想起的

    从“科学教育影片展览”所想起的
    上海科学教育电影制片厂厂长　洪林
    在我手头上，有一封刚刚收到的来信，这信是一位青年人写的，他说：“党和团号召我们青年学习文化，向科学进军，我们除了在实际行动中响应这一号召外，还希望从电影中学习些科学知识。但是我们目前很难看到这种科学教育影片。我不明白：为什么电影工作者不多制作些科学教育影片呢？发行公司为什么不多发行些这种影片呢？难道他们不喜欢这种影片吗？”
    这一质问是很有理由的。平日我们看到的科学教育影片确是不多的。要说人们只爱看故事片，不爱看科学教育片，这是不符合事实的。人们的文化生活是多方面的。正如一个人的案头上可以同时放着文学杂志和科学普及刊物一样，人们在电影院或俱乐部里，也并非只希望看到“董存瑞”，而不希望看到“生命的起源”的。近来，订阅科学杂志，听科学演讲，阅读科学技术书籍的人，一天天增多起来，这说明大家要求获得更多的知识，对科学和技术问题发生了兴趣。尽管不是每一个人都做科学研究工作，但人们却都理解到目前人类正处在一个新的技术革命的前夕，都愿意知道一些科学与技术方面的问题，都渴望着提高自己的文化科学水平。
    拿这一次“科学教育影片展览”中的许多影片来说，“培育壮秧”介绍了陈永康丰产水稻的重要经验，“玉米人工授粉”推广了这一促使玉米丰产的办法，“大脑皮质和机体的功能”和“为了人类”通俗而生动地介绍了巴甫洛夫关于高级神经活动的唯物主义的学说，“植物的生长和发育”和“花”告诉我们一些植物生长的基础知识，以及其他关于预防病虫害的“防治棉蚜”、“预防鸡瘟”，介绍苏联农业机械化的影片“谷物耕作的机械化”与“棉花的综合机械化”等等，难道人们不喜欢看这些影片吗？难道人们不知道增加这些知识对自己是十分有益的事吗？
    目前在科学教育片的生产上，比从前多了一些，也出产了几部质量较好的影片（如“农业生产合作社的包工制”“淡水养鱼”“玉米人工授粉”“培育壮秧”等）；在发行工作上也作了一些改进，如在几个城市设立了专门放映短片的影院等；这些都是为广大观众所欢迎的事。我国的科学教育事业是在进步着，发展着。但是，现在的科学教育片不论在生产上或是发行上都不能适应广大观众的要求，尤其不适应向科学进军后的新形势，这一点，却也是事实。
    在影片制作方面，除了数量少以外，我们还感到题材范围很窄。比如像介绍科学研究活动的影片，适于一般机关干部看的科学基础知识的影片，以及有关历史、地理、文化方面的教育影片，我们拍得极少。而介绍我国古代科学的成就，给少年儿童看的科学常识片，以及科学幻想片等，我们更还没有涉及过。从影片的结构上说，也形成了一套固定的公式，消灭害虫总是“一生活史，二危害，三防治办法”。在许多影片里，都有晦涩难懂、枯燥无味的毛病。明明在自然界活生生的东西，明明在人们日常生活中经常接触到的现象，但到了影片里就变成毫无生气、平淡沉闷的了。因此目前科学教育片的制作上，产量亟需增加、题材范围亟需扩大，质量亟需提高，这样才能为广大观众生产出更多更好的影片。
    在争取科学工作者更积极地参加科学教育片工作上，也是做得不够的。虽然在今年摄制的影片中，半数以上的剧本是各个部门的科学技术工作同志写作的，也差不多每一部影片都有专家、技术人员担任顾问和技术指导，但是，科学教育片与别的片种不一样的地方，就是它必须是在电影工作者和科学工作者最亲密的合作的条件下摄制的。苏联在摄制“生命的起源”时，得到许多著名的科学家、专家的帮助，如奥巴林、勒柏辛斯卡娅，都直接参加了这一影片的摄制工作。我们可以想到，没有科学工作者的协助，只靠电影工作者，是拍不成那样一部科学片的。争取我国科学工作者更多地为科学教育片写作剧本，担任顾问和具体指导，这应当是目前提高科学教育片质量的重要关键。我们觉得，除了科学普及影片以外，我国还应当有把科学家的研究活动纪录下来、或是为了研究某一项科学问题而制作的科学研究片。这样，就更需要科学部门与电影制片厂的合作了。
    至于说到科学教育片的发行问题，目前存在的问题是较多的。比如说，许多影片印的拷贝数量很少，要在全国放映单位兜个圈子，就需要很长的时间。而这些数量很少的拷贝，又未必能够适当地充分地被利用。过去那种把扑灭蚊蝇的影片排在春节放映的情况，现在已经很少出现了，但是没有区别不同内容的影片向不同地区、不同的对象发行的现象，却还是不少的。一位陕西的观众曾经这样说：“我们村里只映过一次‘李锡奎调车法’，可是这里的群众连火车是什么样子都不知道。这一带倒是五谷杂粮的产地，为什么不将‘玉米人工授粉’、‘防治棉蚜’等影片放给农民们看呢？”还有的观众指责：“科学教育片时常在仓库里睡觉，影响了发挥它的作用。”到现在为止，我国的科学教育片，已制成的有六十余部，而翻译苏联和各人民民主国家的科学教育片则在一百部以上了。这里面包括的内容很广，几乎工业上各个部门，农业上各种重要的作物，以及生理卫生、体育锻炼，基础科学知识，文化艺术等各个方面，都或多或少地有几部可用的影片。怎样让某些虫害严重的地区看到防治害虫的片子，让水产地区看看养鱼的片子，让建筑工人看看建筑方面的片子，让农村妇女看看新法接生的片子，让运动员们看看体操游泳之类的片子，让青年文艺工作者看看托尔斯泰手稿之类的片子……并且使他们在看这些片子时很方便，送到他们的面前，这些，确不是一件很容易的事，但也确是观众们所迫切需要解决的问题。
    “科学教育影片展览”开始举行了。通过这一展览，会有更多的人愿意和科学教育片交朋友，愿意经常看到这种影片，以便于得到一些科学知识，扩展自己的眼界，启发进一步学习这些知识的兴趣。
    我们热烈地欢迎这一次“科学教育影片展览”的举办，同时我们也热烈地期待着在科学教育片的制作上、发行工作上有所改进。
