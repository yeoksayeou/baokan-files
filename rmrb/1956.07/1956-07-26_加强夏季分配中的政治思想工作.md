Strengthen Political and Ideological Work in Summer Distribution

The Guangxi Daily published an editorial on July 22nd entitled "Strengthen Political and Ideological Work in Distribution."

The editorial stated that some cadres believe that this year's summer harvest distribution, which is based on the principle of "to each according to his work" and distribution according to workdays, with specific regulations for various deductions from higher authorities, is simpler than that of primary cooperatives. Moreover, summer crops have increased in production, so it is enough to formulate a pre-distribution plan and submit it to the masses for approval, thus neglecting political and ideological work. However, the current reality is that some agricultural cooperatives have spent more than twenty days without finalizing a pre-distribution plan, resulting in the failure to distribute large quantities of harvested early rice in a timely manner. Some cooperatives have finalized distribution plans, but some households with reduced income are dissatisfied with the distribution, and households with increased income also have many opinions about the amount of their increase, with some even falsely reporting their income from last year and denying this year's increase. The dissatisfaction of these members with the summer distribution has affected the consolidation of agricultural cooperatives and the completion of the urgent production tasks of summer harvesting and planting.

The editorial pointed out that the problems existing in the current summer distribution work are diverse. Some agricultural cooperatives cannot guarantee that 90% of their members will increase their income because of excessive deductions. Other cooperatives only care about increasing the income of their members, and even in cases of significant production increases, they do not deduct the portions that should be deducted, such as public grain, seeds, and production investment. Some cooperatives handle non-productive work points simplistically, causing dissatisfaction among many people. Some places simply emphasize publicizing the principle of "to each according to his work," causing anxiety among some households lacking labor. Others overemphasize publicizing the care for "five-guarantee" households, causing some who do not meet the "five-guarantee" conditions to also demand care from the cooperative. Some members, seeing that the seedlings in their production team are growing better than those in other teams, demand independent distribution based on production teams, and some even collectively conceal production after harvesting.

The editorial pointed out that in order to make the summer harvest distribution fair and reasonable, it is necessary to further publicize the principle of "to each according to his work" and the principle of "fewer deductions and more distribution," to conduct collectivist education for members, and to criticize departmentalism. At the same time, it is necessary to vigorously publicize the superiority of advanced agricultural cooperatives, especially to strengthen education for members with reduced income, eliminate their dissatisfaction, and encourage them to work actively and strive for increased income in the second half of the year.

### 加强夏季分配中的政治思想工作

专栏：地方报纸评论摘要

    加强夏季分配中的政治思想工作
    广西日报在七月二十二日发表了一篇题为“加强分配中的政治思想工作”的社论。
    社论说，有些干部认为今年的夏收分配，反正是实行按劳取酬，按劳动日进行分配，各项扣除上级已有具体规定，分配比初级社简单，而且夏收作物增产，只要把预分方案制定出来交群众通过就行了，因而忽视了政治思想工作。而目前的实际情况是：有的农业社预分方案花二十多天还没有订好，以至收割的大批早稻不能及时分配；有的社虽然订好了分配方案，但部分减收户对这项分配表示不满，增收户对自己增多增少的问题也有不少意见，有的甚至虚报去年收入而不承认今年增收。这些社员对夏季分配的不满，影响了农业社的巩固和夏收夏种这一紧急生产任务的完成。
    社论指出，目前正在进行的夏季分配工作存在的问题是多种多样的。有些农业社因各项扣除过多，不能保证90％的社员增加收入，而另一些社只顾社员增收，在增产很多的情况下，连公粮、种子和生产投资等应扣的部分也不扣除，有的社在处理非生产工分时简单从事，而引起了许多人的不满。有些地方单纯强调宣传按劳取酬的分配原则，而引起一些劳力缺乏的困难户不安；而另一些地方过分强调宣传照顾“五保”户，使有些不合乎“五保”条件的，也要求社里照顾。有的社员看到自己生产队里的禾苗比别队禾苗长得好，就要求以生产队为单位独立分配，甚至有的在收割后集体隐满产量。
    社论指出，为了使夏收分配做到公平合理，必须进一步宣传按劳取酬的分配原则和“少扣多分”的原则，对社员进行集体主义教育，批判本位主义思想；同时大张旗鼓地宣传高级农业社的优越性，特别是加强对部分减少收入的社员进行教育，消除他们的不满情绪，从而鼓励他们积极劳动、争取下半年增加收入。　（据新华社讯）
