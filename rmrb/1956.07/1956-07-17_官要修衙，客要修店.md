Title: "Officials Want to Renovate Offices, Travelers Want to Renovate Inns"

　　There is an old Chinese saying: "Officials don't renovate offices, travelers don't renovate inns." The meaning is obvious and doesn't need explanation. Now I've changed both "don't" to "want," which allows me to elaborate a bit.

　　Today, we have many large cities, especially Beijing. Throughout the year, countless people come to report, request instructions, attend meetings and discussions, and even sightsee, seek medical treatment, visit friends, and see relatives... In short, endless reasons. However, the old hotels, big and small, are almost entirely booked. It's not just that there are no vacancies; even if there were, only one thing would welcome the visitors from afar: a closed door!

　　Booking all the hotels still doesn't solve the problem, so countless "guesthouses," big and small, are established for unforeseen needs. Roomier civilian houses are bought up, one guesthouse here, another there, creating a peculiar spectacle.

　　The travelers arrive in Beijing or wherever, full of excitement. The notice says to report to a certain ministry, department, or committee. But these organizations aren't open 24 hours a day—and even if they are, they aren't prepared to handle this matter—so even after arriving, there's nowhere to report. Especially those arriving after 8 or 9 p.m., they're even more at a loss: the offices are closed, and the inns are full. As for the vast majority of ordinary travelers who have nowhere to report, their situation is naturally even more miserable. To describe it in the style of *Water Margin*: "Having gotten off the train, one sees: bright lights, bustling crowds, restaurants and inns, all full—a lively scene indeed! As the poem goes: Nowhere to report, nowhere to stay. Wandering aimlessly around the city, the feeling is indescribable." Booking hotels and setting up guesthouses are both a great waste, especially the guesthouses. A guesthouse, though small, is fully equipped, with a director, section chiefs, staff, service personnel, cooks... everything. When there are guests, they entertain the guests; when there are no guests, they entertain themselves. It's truly: "Many empty houses in the city, travelers sleep on the streets." How unreasonable.

　　This isn't the only example. From Wuchang Railway Station to the ferry terminal on the Yangtze River, there's quite a long stretch of road, without any shelter. Only at the edge of the dock is a small room the size of a palm, which can accommodate dozens of people but still doesn't provide shelter from the wind and rain. Over 90% of the passengers on a train have to support the old and carry the young, lugging luggage and standing there waiting for two or three hours. When it rains heavily, it's enough to make people want to jump up and curse—but the ground is full of water, and no one dares to jump. (Before 1953, I had the pleasure of experiencing this several times; I don't know what the situation is now.)

　　Should government offices be renovated? Of course, they should. But shouldn't the dormitories, hospitals, hotels of the vast number of workers and staff, and the waiting rooms of places where thousands of people come and go every day be renovated, even more so? Some people say that we can't do everything at once. True. Weighing priorities, can offices be renovated in a more simple way? Can fewer clubs, large auditoriums, etc., be built for government organizations, or can they be built more simply?

　　The people do not approve of building "government offices" too many or too lavishly. The people's inns—long-term homes, temporary hotels—should be built as many and as extensively as possible.

　　Otherwise, you won't escape the blame of only renovating offices and not renovating inns.

### “官要修衙，客要修店”

    “官要修衙，客要修店”
    严秀
    中国有句老话叫“官不修衙，客不修店”，意思一看就明白的，用不着解释了。现在我把两个不字都改成要字，就可以借此发挥一番议论。
    现在我们有很多大城市，特别是北京，一年到头不知有多少人要来报告、请示、开会座谈，以至观光、治病、访友、探亲……总之，说不完的事。但是，旧的大大小小的旅馆差不多都被人包下来了，不用说没有空位，就是有空位，也只用一件东西来欢迎远方的来客：闭门羹！
    旅馆包完了还是解决不了问题，就设立无数大大小小的、以备不时之需的“招待所”，把比较宽敞的民房通通买下来，你一个招待所，我一个招待所，蔚为奇观。
    旅客们兴高采烈地来到了北京或者哪里。通知上是到某部、某府、某委员会报到。但是这些机关并不是二十四时都办公的——即使办公，它也并没有专管这件事情的准备——虽然到了，却无处可报。尤其是晚上八、九时以后到的，更是走头无路：衙已关门，店已人满。至于那些占绝大多数的无到可报的普通旅客，当然更是狼狈了。用水浒传式的笔墨来描写一下，那就是：“下得车来，但见：灯火辉皇，熙来攘往，酒家客店，俱是人满——好一番热闹景象！有诗为证：到也无处报，店也无处投。满城团团转，滋味在心头。”包旅馆与设招待所，都是很大的浪费，尤其是招待所。一个招待所，麻雀虽小，肝胆俱全，主任、科长、科员、服务员、炊事员……应有尽有。有客人时招待客人，没客人时招待自己。正是：“满城多空屋，来客宿街头。”好不合理。
    这不是唯一的例子。从武昌车站到长江边的轮渡码头，还有好长一截路，无遮无盖，只在码头边上有巴掌大一间小屋，可容数十人还不蔽风雨，一列车的旅客，十分之九以上都要扶老携幼、扛着行李在那里立着等候两三个钟头不等，大雨倾盆时，简直要令人跳起脚来骂人——不过满地是水，谁也不敢跳。（1953年以前，笔者数次恭逢其盛，现在的情形不晓得了。）
    机关应该不应该修呢？当然应该修。但是广大职工的宿舍、医院、旅馆、天天来往成千上万人的地方的候车室等应不应该修呢，更应该修。有人说，不能百废俱兴。对。权衡轻重缓急，办公室可不可以修得简朴一点呢？俱乐部、机关大礼堂等等可不可以少修几个，或者修建得简朴一点呢？
    人民是不赞成把“衙门”修建得太多太阔气的。人民住的店——长住的家，临时的旅馆——倒应该尽可能的多修多盖。
    如若不然，你就难逃只管修衙、不管修店的责骂了。
