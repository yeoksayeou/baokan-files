A Huge Industrial Base of the Future Soviet Union
Jun Qiang

Kustanai in the Kazakh Republic is no stranger to us. The heroic deeds of Soviet youth reclaiming wasteland are closely linked to this name. With admiration for the patriotic actions and labor achievements of Soviet youth, and with infinite joy at the reclamation achievements of our Soviet friends, we came to Kustanai.

In 1954, responding to the call of the Party and the government, thousands of young volunteers came from Moscow and Leningrad, from Ukraine and other places. They brought the labor of their youth and songs of happiness to this formerly desolate grassland—Kustanai Oblast. In two years, they built ninety-four new state farms in this oblast (there were only twenty-nine originally). They have already settled down and started families on the grasslands, turning four million hectares of grassland into a boundless, sea-like wheat field.

The face of Kustanai Oblast has undergone great changes. But even greater changes are yet to come. In the near future, Kustanai Oblast will not only be an agricultural oblast with large-scale state farms, but also become one of the huge metallurgical industrial centers with rows of chimneys. Because recently extremely rich deposits of various minerals have been discovered in this oblast.

Kustanai Oblast is located within the Turgai Basin. This large basin has an area of ​​400,000 square kilometers, with the southern Ural Mountains to the west and the Kazakh Uplands to the east. The Turgai Basin includes the entire Kustanai Oblast, as well as parts of four oblasts of the Kazakh Republic and parts of Chelyabinsk Oblast and Kurgan Oblast. This area, which was initially considered just a "hopeless" grassland, is now called "Greater Turgai" and is listed among the richest treasures of the Soviet Union.

In Kustanai, we visited Comrade Jiechelev, manager of the "Kustanai Geological Exploration Trust," and Comrade Bagishev-Tarasov, chief engineer. They enthusiastically and in detail introduced to us the situation of mineral deposits discovered in Greater Turgai.

The main mineral deposit area of ​​Greater Turgai is tens of kilometers wide from east to west and extends three hundred kilometers from north to south. Some of the world's largest magnetite deposits have been discovered near the city of Kustanai, which can be mined in open pits. Now, the Sokolovsk-Sarbay Mining and Beneficiation Combine has been established 50 kilometers away from Kustanai and has begun mining iron ore. The planned annual output is ten million tons.

Billions of tons of limonite have been prospected. This is an oolitic limonite that can be used to refine iron, vanadium, and phosphorus. The largest limonite production area, the Ayat mining area, has an area of ​​2,000 square kilometers. Another Lisakovsk mining area stretches for one hundred kilometers, and the ore sand is only one to three meters deep from the ground. The reserves of these two mining areas will be no less than the world-renowned Lorraine mining area in Western Europe.

In addition to iron ore, many lignite deposits have also been discovered in the Turgai Basin. The Ubagen lignite area has reserves of 47 billion tons, with a coal seam thickness of 30 to 70 meters.

High-quality bauxite has also been discovered in the Amangelda district of Kustanai Oblast. Deposits of nickel, cobalt, titanium, zirconium, asbestos, etc. are also abundant in Kustanai Oblast.

Based on the currently proven resources, Greater Turgai will be the largest mineral and mineral raw material base in the Soviet Union, because its resources are many times greater than the reserves of the Urals in terms of important mineral deposits.

The treasure hunt in Kustanai Oblast was launched on a large scale at the end of 1950, and the first stage ended in 1954. In four years, they drilled a total of two million meters. The explorers' great achievements in such a short period of time are an amazing achievement in the history of world exploration.

The Soviet Party and government have allocated a large amount of manpower and material resources to support the treasure hunt in the wilderness. However, no matter how abundant the machinery and equipment, it would not have been possible to achieve such achievements in such a short period of time without the heroic labor of the people who explored the treasures for the motherland.

Greater Turgai can become the most important iron ore base for the rapidly developing metallurgical industry in the Southern Urals, Kazakhstan, and Western Siberia. Ubagen's coal can also supply the Urals, so that the Urals no longer needs to transport coal to distant Eastern Siberia. Due to the unique natural resources of the Turgai Basin, it itself will also become a new industrial base in the Soviet Union. There will be huge ferrous metallurgy industry, agricultural machinery manufacturing industry, sulfuric acid and various building materials manufacturing industries, etc. Kustanai Oblast will also prosper with the development of the natural wealth of Greater Turgai.

    苏联未来的一个巨大工业基地
    君强
    哈萨克共和国的库斯坦奈，对我们说来并不生疏。苏联青年开荒的英勇豪迈的事迹，是同这个名字紧密地连在一起的。我们怀着对苏联青年的爱国行为和劳动功绩的敬佩的心情，怀着对苏联朋友垦荒成绩的无限欣慰，来到了库斯坦奈。
    1954年，响应党和政府的号召，从莫斯科和列宁格勒，从乌克兰和其他各地来了成千上万的青年志愿垦荒者。他们把青春的劳动和幸福的歌声带到了这个过去荒漠的草原——库斯坦奈州。两年来，他们在这个州新建了九十四个国营农场（原来只有二十九个），他们已经在草原上成家立业，把四百万公顷草原变成了一望无际的碧海般的麦田。
    库斯坦奈州的面貌已经发生了很大的变化。但是更大的变化还在前面。不久的将来，库斯坦奈州不仅是拥有大规模的国营农场的农业州，而且要成为烟囱林立的巨大的冶金工业中心之一。因为近来在这个州发现了极其丰富的各种矿藏。
    库斯坦奈州处于图尔加依盆地内。这个大盆地的面积有四十万平方公里，它的西部是南乌拉尔山，东部是哈萨克丘陵地带。图尔加依盆地除库斯坦奈州全部外，还包括哈萨克共和国的四个州的各一部分以及车里雅宾斯克州和库尔干州的各一部分。这个地带，最初被认为只不过是“没有前途”的草原，现在已被称做“大图尔加依”而列入苏联最富的宝库行列之中了。
    我们在库斯坦奈访问了“库斯坦奈地质勘探托辣斯”的经理皆切列夫同志和总工程师巴吉谢夫—塔拉索夫同志。他们两位热情而详细地向我们介绍了在大图尔加依发现矿藏的情况。
    大图尔加依的主要矿藏地区，东西宽好几十公里，南北长达三百公里。在靠近库斯坦奈城的地方发现了一些世界上最大的磁铁矿，可以露天开采。现在，在距库斯坦奈五十公里的地方建立了索科洛夫斯克—萨尔巴依选矿联合公司，已经着手开采铁矿。年产量计划是一千万吨。
    勘探出来的褐铁矿有好几十亿吨。这是一种鲕状褐铁矿，可以用来炼铁、钒和磷。最大的褐铁产地阿雅特矿区面积有二千平方公里。另外一个里萨科夫卡矿区连绵达一百公里，而且矿砂距地面只有一至三公尺深。这两个矿区的储藏量将不亚于西欧具有世界声誉的洛林矿区。
    除去铁矿，在图尔加依盆地还发现了许多褐煤。乌巴干褐煤区的蕴藏量就有四百七十亿吨，煤层厚度是三十公尺至七十公尺。
    在库斯坦奈州的阿曼格尔达区还发现了质量很高的铝土矿。镍、钴、钛、锆、石棉等矿藏，在库斯坦奈州也很丰富。
    根据现在探明的资源，大图尔加依将是苏联最大的矿产和矿物原料基地，因为这儿的资源在重要矿藏方面比乌拉尔的储藏量多出许多倍。
    库斯坦奈州的探宝工作是从1950年底大规模展开的，到1954年第一阶段结束。四年间，他们共钻探了二百万公尺。勘探工作者在这样短的时期内获得这样大的成绩，是世界勘探史上惊人的成就。
    苏联的党和政府曾拨出了大量的人力物力来支持荒原上的探宝工作。但是，无论有怎样丰足的机器设备，如果没有为祖国勘探宝藏的人们的英勇劳动，也不可能在这样短的时期内得到这样的成就。
    大图尔加依可以成为南乌拉尔、哈萨克斯坦和西部西伯利亚迅速发展着的冶金业最重要的铁矿基地。乌巴干的煤也可以供给乌拉尔，使乌拉尔不必再到遥远的东西伯利亚去运煤。由于图尔加依盆地有独一无二的各种自然富源，它本身也将要成为苏联一个新的工业基地。这里将有巨大的黑色冶金业、农业机器制造业、硫酸和各种建筑材料制造业等等。库斯坦奈州也将随着大图尔加依自然财富的开发而繁荣起来。
