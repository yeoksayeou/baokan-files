    Datong Shili River Bridge Opens to Traffic

    The newly built Shili River Bridge in Datong city opened to traffic on July 1st. This is a heavy-duty steel and concrete bridge with a length of 202 meters. Before the completion of this bridge, the city center and the industrial area in the western suburbs were connected by a wooden bridge. With the rapid development of Datong's industry, the wooden bridge could no longer meet transportation needs. After the opening of the new Shili River Bridge, the city center and the industrial area in the western suburbs—Datong Cement Plant, Datong Power Plant, and other factories, and the Datong Mining Bureau—have become connected as a whole.

    大同十里河大桥通车
    大同市区新建的十里河大桥，已于七月一日通车。这是一座长达202公尺的钢骨水泥重型大桥。在这座大桥未建成以前，市中心区和西郊的工业区是通过一条木桥联系的。随着大同市工业的迅速发展，木桥早已不能满足运输需要，新建的十里河大桥通车后，市中心区和西郊的工业区——大同水泥厂、大同电厂等工厂和大同矿务局已连成一片。　（刘树岗）
