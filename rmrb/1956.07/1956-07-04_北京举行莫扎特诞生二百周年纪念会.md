	Mao Dun, a member of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Council, delivered the opening speech. He said that Mozart became an immortal master of the Classical period not only because he composed those perfect, bright and cheerful melodies, but more importantly because he expressed the thoughts and feelings of the general people on the eve of the French Revolution, and supported truth and justice with practical actions. He worked tirelessly and creatively, writing more than 600 works in his short life. Mao Dun said that a powerful dawn of peace has appeared on the horizon of the human world. In order to defend, inherit and carry forward Mozart's artistic heritage, we must continue to work hard to strengthen and expand the peace forces, so that the people of all countries in the world can live in harmony in a free and equal family, and so that all mankind can enjoy all the material and spiritual wealth created by generations, and live a richer and more meaningful life. In his opening speech, Mao Dun, on behalf of the China Preparatory Committee for the Commemoration of World Cultural Celebrities in 1956 and the people of Beijing, paid high tribute to the Austrian people who produced the great genius Mozart, and congratulated the growing friendship between the Chinese and Austrian people.

This year, the whole world is commemorating him, which marks how closely art connects the people of all countries and brings them closer to each other in spirit.
