    Night Air Combat
    Xinhua News Agency Reporter Fang Huang
    At midnight on June 22nd, while people were still sound asleep, an American-made B-17G four-engine bomber belonging to the "Intelligence Department of the Air Force Headquarters" of the Chiang Kai-shek army, sneaked into the skies over Zhejiang and Jiangxi provinces like a thief. Carrying a radio and a large number of reactionary leaflets filled with slander and vilification, they were confident that they could carry out all kinds of evil sabotage activities unnoticed in the darkness of night. However, as soon as this Chiang Kai-shek aircraft entered the mainland of the motherland, it was already under the close surveillance of the Air Defense Force soldiers.
    That night, the commanders and fighters on combat duty at an air force airport, as always, vigilantly guarded their posts. A little after 11 p.m., the airport command post received intelligence from an Air Defense Force observation post that Chiang Kai-shek aircraft were operating nearby. Simultaneously with receiving these continuous enemy situation reports, radar, like a net spread across the vast sky, quickly and accurately detected a Chiang Kai-shek aircraft in flight. At this time, the combat personnel at the airport and command post were all busy. The commander issued an order to annihilate the Chiang Kai-shek aircraft. Soon, the fighter planes were fully loaded with ammunition, ready for take-off. Bao Yuqiao, the duty officer on duty at the radar station, was concentrating on operating the machine, closely monitoring the Chiang Kai-shek aircraft, and maintaining the clarity of the signal.
    At each anti-aircraft artillery position, officers and soldiers were also ready to fire at any moment.
    As soon as Air Force First-Class Combat Hero Major Lu Min received the order, he immediately took off in a high-speed jet fighter. In the sky, at the airport, at the radar station, and at the command post, the officers and soldiers were all encouraged by the confidence of annihilating the Chiang Kai-shek aircraft. The young guiding navigator, Tang Zhiyao, watched the track of the Chiang Kai-shek aircraft on the fluorescent screen, accurately calculated the altitude, speed, and direction, and quickly reported the enemy situation to the commander and pilot, guiding our giant-winged eagle to pounce on the Chiang Kai-shek aircraft.
    It was already past 12 a.m. The shadows of the mountains and plains stretched far into the distance. The majestic roar of our aircraft broke the silence of the earth. The voice of our air force command post guiding the pilot forward echoed in the radio.
    In order to avoid being discovered, the Chiang Kai-shek aircraft kept changing course, sometimes to the east and sometimes to the south. But no matter how cunning the Chiang Kai-shek aircraft was, it could not overcome the courage and resourcefulness of the People's Liberation Army Air Force. Under correct command and guidance, our fighter plane kept tracking the Chiang Kai-shek aircraft and was getting closer and closer. When it was only five kilometers away from the Chiang Kai-shek aircraft, the cunning Chiang Kai-shek aircraft changed direction to the south again. Our fighter plane quickly followed and changed direction accordingly, and, based on night combat experience, circled to a favorable position where it was easier to observe the Chiang Kai-shek aircraft.
      "The Chiang Kai-shek aircraft is two kilometers away from you," "You are together with the Chiang Kai-shek aircraft," the guiding voice of the command post came continuously from the radio. The fighter plane piloted by Major Lu Min quickly approached the Chiang Kai-shek aircraft. He stared intently at the wriggling shadow. When it was within range, he immediately aimed accurately and pressed the button. A series of shells were fired, and a flame burst out of the wing of the Chiang Kai-shek aircraft, indicating that it had been hit. The sudden and heavy blow panicked the Chiang Kai-shek aircraft. The Chiang Kai-shek aircraft reduced its altitude and tried to escape, but Major Lu Min calmly followed closely behind the Chiang Kai-shek aircraft, aligned the sight, and started a second fierce attack at a distance of 270 meters. The fire dragon of the shells roared through the night sky, and two larger flames flashed out of the left wing of the Chiang Kai-shek aircraft, quickly followed by streams of fire. This Chiang Kai-shek aircraft, which came to disturb the peaceful and happy life of the people of the motherland, dragging thick smoke and bright red flames, swept across the quiet night sky and crashed into a mountain gully in Guangfeng County, Shangrao area, Jiangxi Province, at 1:00 a.m. on the 23rd. The wreckage of the Chiang Kai-shek aircraft, shattered into countless pieces by the hillside, burned with two raging fires, illuminating the hillside and the small river as if it were daytime.
    Major Lu Min, with a relaxed and happy mood, flew over the sweet sleeping and lovely motherland and returned victoriously.

    黑夜空战
    新华社记者　方徨
    六月二十二日的午夜，当人们都还在沉沉熟睡的时候，一架蒋军
  “空军总司令部情报署”的美制B—17G型四引擎轰炸机，像小偷般悄悄地窜入浙江、江西两省的上空。他们带着电台，还有大量充满了造谣诬蔑的反动传单，满以为乘这无光的深夜，可以神不知鬼不觉地进行各种罪恶的破坏勾当。可是，这架蒋机刚开始进入祖国大陆上空，已经在防空军战士们的严密监视下了。
    这天晚上，我空军某部机场上执行战斗值班的指挥员、战斗员们，像往常一样警惕地严守在各自的岗位上。深夜十一点多钟，机场指挥所接到了来自防空军观察哨的情报，说有蒋机在附近活动。在接到这些不断传来的敌情报告的同时，向辽阔的天空张开罗网的雷达，也迅速准确地侦察到一架蒋机正在飞行。这时候，机场和指挥所的战勤人员都忙碌起来。指挥员下达歼击蒋机的命令。很快地，歼击机满载了炮弹待命起飞。正在雷达站值班的值班军官包钰桥，全神贯注地操纵着机器，牢牢地监视着蒋机，保持信号的清晰。
    在各个高射炮兵阵地上，官兵们也时刻准备着开火。
    空军一级战斗英雄鲁珉少校一接到命令，马上驾着高速度的喷气式歼击机，腾空而起。在天空、在机场、在雷达站、在指挥所，官兵们都为歼击蒋机的信心鼓舞着。年青的引导领航员汤志耀，注视着萤光板上蒋机的航迹，精确地计算着高度、速度、方位，把敌情迅速报告指挥员、飞行员，引导着我们张开巨翼的雄鹰扑向蒋机。
    已经是深夜十二点多钟了，群峰和原野的暗影一直延伸到远方，我机雄壮的吼声冲破了大地的寂静，无线电中回响着我空军指挥所引导飞行员前进的声音。
    蒋机为了避免被发觉，就一会儿向东、一会儿向南不停地调换着航向。可是不管蒋机怎样狡猾，总战胜不了人民解放军空军的英勇和机智。在正确的指挥和引导下，我们的歼击机一直追踪着蒋机，而且越来越近了。就在离蒋机只有五公里远的时候，狡猾的蒋机又改向南飞了，我们的歼击机很快地跟随着也改变了方向，并且根据夜间作战的经验，绕到比较容易观察蒋机的有利位置。
      “蒋机离你二公里”，“你和蒋机在一起了”，无线电里连续传来指挥所引导的声音。鲁珉少校驾驶的歼击机迅速地迫近蒋机。他紧紧盯住那蠕动着的黑影，到了射程以内，立刻瞄得准确，把电钮一按，一连串的炮弹打出去了，蒋机的机翼顿时冒出了一道火光，已经中弹了。突如其来的狠狠的打击，使蒋机发了慌。蒋机降低高度企图挣扎着逃跑，鲁珉少校沉着地紧跟在蒋机的正后方，对好了瞄准器，在距离二百七十公尺的时候，又开始第二次猛烈的射击，炮弹的火龙呼啸着在夜空飞过，蒋机的左机翼又闪出更大的两团火光，很快又吐出一道道火舌，这架来扰乱祖国人民和平幸福生活的蒋机，拖曳着浓烟和鲜红的火焰，掠过宁静的夜空，坠落在江西省上饶地区广丰县境的山沟里，时间是二十三日一时。被山坡撞碎而分成无数片的蒋机残骸，燃烧着两堆熊熊大火，把山坡和小河照射得如同白昼。
    鲁珉少校怀着轻松愉快的心情，飞过甜睡着的可爱的祖国大地的上空，胜利返航了。
