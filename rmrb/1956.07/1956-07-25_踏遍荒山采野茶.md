Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, 22nd July: Farmers in the tea-producing areas of Fujian Province are picking and processing wild tea from the barren mountains to sell to the state. According to incomplete statistics from the Fujian Provincial Company of the China Tea Corporation, since the summer tea harvest began this year, the province has already purchased more than 42,000 jin of wild tea from the barren mountains, increasing the income of farmers in tea-producing areas by 20,000 to 30,000 yuan.

Fujian Province has a long history of tea production. Before the War of Resistance Against Japan, the province had a total of 540,000 mu of tea gardens. During the war, most of the tea gardens were abandoned. Since liberation, although tea production in the province has greatly recovered, there are still many abandoned tea gardens that have not been reclaimed. Therefore, picking wild tea from the barren mountains is one of the important sources for increasing tea production.

In June of this year, the Fujian Provincial People's Committee stipulated that those who pick and process wild tea from the barren mountains will be given an additional bonus of 10% of the total sales value, which further increased the production enthusiasm of farmers in tea-producing areas. Many tea-producing areas have formed a surge of "Traversing the wild mountains to pick wild tea, striving to return every leaf to the old home." At present, the work of picking wild tea is still continuing.

### 踏遍荒山采野茶

    踏遍荒山采野茶
    新华社福州22日电　福建省茶区农民采制荒山野茶，卖给国家。据中国茶业公司福建省公司到昨天为止的不完全统计，今年开始采制夏茶以来，全省已经收购四万二千多斤荒山野茶，使茶区农民增加收入二、三万元。
    福建省茶区历史悠久。在抗日战争前，全省共有茶园五十四万亩。抗战期间，茶园大部荒芜。解放后到现在，全省茶叶生产虽然已有很大恢复，但是没有垦复的荒芜茶园还很多。因此，采摘荒山野茶是增加茶叶产量的重要来源之一。
    今年六月，福建省人民委员会规定对采制荒山野茶者按其出售总值另发给10％的奖金，进一步提高了茶区农民的生产兴趣。不少茶区形成了“踏遍荒山采野茶，争取片叶还老家”的热潮。目前，采野茶的工作还在继续进行。
