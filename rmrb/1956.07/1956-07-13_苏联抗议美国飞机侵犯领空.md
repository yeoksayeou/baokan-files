Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, July 11th: Soviet Ambassador to the United States, Zarubin, visited U.S. Secretary of State Dulles on July 10th and handed him a note from the Soviet government protesting the intrusion of U.S. aircraft into Soviet airspace.

    The note stated: According to verified information, on July 4th at 8:18 AM Moscow time, a U.S. Air Force twin-engine medium bomber flew from the American occupation zone in West Germany, passing over the airspace of the German Democratic Republic, and at 9:35 AM intruded into Soviet airspace in the Grodno region from the Polish People's Republic. The intruding aircraft flew along the route Minsk, Vilnius, Kaunas, Kaliningrad, penetrating 320 kilometers into Soviet territory, and remained there for one hour and thirty-two minutes.

    On July 5th at 7:41 AM Moscow time, a U.S. Air Force twin-engine medium bomber flew from the American occupation zone in West Germany, passing over the airspace of the German Democratic Republic, and at 8:54 AM intruded into Soviet airspace near Brest from the Polish People's Republic. The intruding aircraft flew along the route Brest, Pinsk, Baranovichi, Kaunas, and Kaliningrad, penetrating 150 kilometers into Soviet territory, and remained there for one hour and twenty minutes. On the same day, another U.S. Air Force twin-engine bomber violated Soviet airspace, penetrating a considerable distance into Soviet territory.

    On July 9th, another incident occurred of U.S. aircraft violating Soviet airspace.

    The note stated: The above-mentioned incidents of U.S. aircraft intruding into Soviet airspace can only be considered intentional and for reconnaissance purposes.

    The note emphasized that these serious violations of Soviet airspace occurred at a time when international tensions had been somewhat eased. The note stated that in some countries, reactionary elements hostile to the cause of peace were alarmed by the apparent easing of international tensions. They are doing everything possible to prevent further improvement in relations between countries and to prevent the establishment of trust between countries. The serious violations of Soviet airspace by the aforementioned U.S. Air Force aircraft must be seen as such an attempt.

    The note stated that it is noteworthy that the above-mentioned actions of U.S. aircraft violating Soviet airspace occurred while U.S. Air Force Chief of Staff General Twining was staying in the Federal Republic of Germany.

    The Soviet government lodged a strong protest with the U.S. government regarding the serious violations of Soviet airspace by U.S. aircraft, believing that this was a deliberate act by certain elements in the United States aimed at worsening relations between the Soviet Union and the United States. The note stated: Such violations are unacceptable. The Soviet government declared that the U.S. government would bear full responsibility for any consequences that might arise from these violations. The Soviet government hoped that the U.S. government would take measures to punish those responsible for the violations and to prevent such violations from happening again.

    苏联抗议美国飞机侵犯领空
    新华社讯　据塔斯社莫斯科11日讯：苏联驻美国大使查鲁宾七月十日访问了美国国务卿杜勒斯，交给他苏联政府照会一份，抗议美国飞机侵犯苏联领空。
    照会说：根据已经证实的材料，在今年七月四日莫斯科时间八时十八分，美国空军双引擎中型轰炸机一架从西德美国占领区飞来，飞过德意志民主共和国领空，在九时三十五分从波兰人民共和国侵入苏联格罗德纳州的领空，入侵的飞机沿明斯克、维尔纽斯、考那斯、加里宁格勒路线飞行，深入苏联领土达320公里，在那里逗留了一小时又三十二分钟。
    七月五日莫斯科时间七时四十一分，美国空军双引擎中型轰炸机一架从西德美国占领区飞过德意志民主共和国领空，在八时五十四分从波兰人民共和国侵入布列斯特附近的苏联领空。入侵的飞机沿布列斯特、平斯克、巴拉诺维济、考那斯和加里宁格勒路线飞行，深入苏联领土一百五十公里，在那里逗留了一小时又二十分钟。同一天，另一架美国空军双引擎轰炸机侵犯苏联领空，深入苏联领土很远的地方。
    七月九日，又发生了美国飞机侵犯苏联领空的事件。
    照会说：上述美国飞机侵犯苏联领空的事件只能被估计为有意的，是为了侦察目的的。
    照会强调指出，这些严重侵犯苏联领空的行为是在国际紧张局势已经得到一定程度的缓和的时候发生的。照会说，在若干国家中，敌视和平事业的反动分子因国际紧张局势的明显的缓和而感到惊慌。他们正在千方百计地企图阻止各国间关系的进一步改善，阻止各国间的信任的建立。上述美国空军飞机严重侵犯苏联领空的行为，必须被认为是这样一种企图。
    照会说，在这方面值得注意的事实是：上述美国飞机侵犯苏联领空的行动正是在美国空军参谋长特文宁将军停留在德意志联邦共和国的时候发生的。
    苏联政府为美国飞机严重侵犯苏联领空的行为向美国政府提出坚决抗议，认为这是美国某些分子故意采取的行动，目的在于使苏联和美国的关系恶化。照会说：这种侵犯活动是不能容许的。苏联政府宣布，这种侵犯所可能造成的后果的全部责任要由美国政府承担。苏联政府希望美国政府采取措施，惩办那些对侵犯事件负责的人员，并且防止今后再发生这种侵犯事件。
