    The Evolving Japanese Political Situation
    Shen Yuqiang
    The political situation in Japan is undergoing noteworthy changes along with the development of the international situation. This evolution reflects the waxing and waning of two lines of struggle: the forces demanding peace and independence are growing daily, while the forces succumbing to the United States and rearming are constantly being defeated.
    The House of Councillors election held on July 8 was an important sign of the evolution of the Japanese political situation. In this election, the Socialist Party increased its seats by twelve, and the Communist Party increased its seats by one. Together with progressive independents, they won a total of eighty-six seats, exceeding one-third of the total two hundred and fifty seats in the House of Councillors. This means that the combined strength of these parties, which oppose rearmament, has prevented the ruling conservative parties, led by the Liberal Democratic Party, from realizing their plan to amend the constitution through this election.
    The Japanese constitution prohibits Japan from participating in war and possessing war forces. This provision has become a stumbling block for the United States to rearm Japan. However, to amend the Japanese constitution, it must first be approved by a two-thirds majority of both houses of the Diet. The Liberal Democratic Party, which advocates rearmament, does not have enough seats in either house of the Diet to reach this number. Therefore, it hoped to first obtain two-thirds of the seats in the House of Councillors through this election, and then, in one fell swoop, announce the dissolution of the House of Representatives, and use the opportunity of re-election to achieve the same goal in the House of Representatives. However, in the House of Councillors election, the Liberal Democratic Party's plan was rejected by the voters. As a result of the election, the Liberal Democratic Party could only maintain its pre-election number of seats—122, which is less than half of the total seats in the House of Councillors. At the same time, the Ryokufukai, the Liberal Democratic Party's ally in the House of Councillors, plummeted from its original forty-three seats to thirty-one. The sum of the seats of these two parties is also far from a two-thirds majority. Under normal circumstances, both houses of the Japanese Diet will not be re-elected until three years later. The plan to amend the constitution will be "frozen" for these three years.
    In the campaign for this House of Councillors election, the issue of Japan's foreign policy occupied a very important position. The focus of the issue was whether Japan should continue to follow the United States and accelerate rearmament, and whether it should quickly restore normal relations with China and the Soviet Union. In essence, this is the question of whether Japan wants peace and an independent and autonomous policy. The failure of the Liberal Democratic Party in the election is the inevitable result of its policies failing to meet the wishes and interests of the broad masses of the Japanese people.
    The United States is very uneasy about the results of the Japanese House of Councillors election. The "New York Times" believes that "it must be regarded as a sign that there is some political instability in Japan, and that a trend that is not very friendly to the United States has emerged and persisted..." The American "Daily Mirror" believes that this election reflects Japan's neutral tendency.
    The neutral tendency in Japan that the United States is worried about actually refers to the widespread demand in Japan for pursuing a policy of peace and independence: opposing the continued occupation of Japan by the United States, opposing Japanese rearmament, demanding the improvement of relations with China and the Soviet Union, demanding the restoration of Sino-Japanese trade... With the further trend towards relaxation of the international situation recently, with the expansion of the area of peace and the development of the struggle for national independence in the whole of Asia after the Asian-African Conference, and with the bankruptcy of the U.S. "embargo" policy towards China, this demand of the broad masses of the Japanese people has become increasingly strong, and has been vividly reflected in the domestic political situation in Japan. The Socialist Party and the Communist Party, in line with the demands of the people, launched a powerful attack on the current policies pursued by the Liberal Democratic Party, and achieved victory.
    This situation of struggle was very prominent in the House of Councillors election and the 24th regular session of the Diet, which closed in June. In this session, the Liberal Democratic Party, relying on its majority in the Diet, coupled with some crude methods, including extending the session and sending police to beat up Socialist Party members, forcibly passed the 1956 budget, the bills for establishing the "National Defense Council" and the "Constitution Investigation Committee," and the new Education Committee Bill. These bills were formulated around the same goal of re-militarization. Nevertheless, the real victor of the struggle is still not the rulers, but the people. When the Diet session closed on June 3, there were still thirty bills that failed to pass. The most important of these was the Small Electoral District System Bill. This bill is directly related to the plan to amend the constitution. Because the electoral districts are smaller, it will help the ruling party to obtain a two-thirds majority. Immediately after the failure of this House of Councillors election, some conservatives revealed their regret over the abandonment of this bill.
    The struggle between the two lines is also reflected in the exacerbation of internal contradictions and differences within the Liberal Democratic Party. The Liberal Democratic Party was originally unstable. It is a mixture of Japanese conservative parties, with internal factions and conflicting interests.
    With the development of the international and domestic situation, sharp differences have arisen among the various factions within the Liberal Democratic Party on whether it is necessary to unify and change policies to adapt to changes in the situation. This difference is particularly evident in the issues of Soviet-Japanese negotiations and attitudes towards China. Pro-former Prime Minister Shigeru Yoshida's former Liberal Party members insisted on opposing the conclusion of an agreement in the Soviet-Japanese negotiations and opposing the normalization of Sino-Japanese relations. They supported and encouraged the heads of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' argument of "prudence" in conducting Japanese-Soviet negotiations. The faction that actually controls the government, which supports Prime Minister Ichiro Hatoyama, advocates reaching an agreement in the Soviet-Japanese negotiations as soon as possible, so as to obtain public opinion's sympathy and support for the Liberal Democratic Party, thereby consolidating its rule. Under the strong demands of the Japanese people and the irresistible impetus of the international situation, the Hatoyama government took some steps to meet the demands of the Japanese people, such as reaching an agreement with the Soviet Union in the negotiations on fishery issues, and agreeing to reopen Soviet-Japanese negotiations before July 31. The Hatoyama government has also repeatedly expressed its willingness to improve relations with China, and expressed its intention to follow Britain in relaxing the "embargo" against China. At the same time, these measures further promoted the contradictions within the Liberal Democratic Party. In May, there were rumors that the important positions of the Liberal Democratic Party and the Hatoyama Cabinet would be changed. It was revealed that this reorganization was to unify the opinions of the party and the government in order to facilitate the early restoration of Japanese-Soviet diplomatic relations; at the same time, it was also aimed at this House of Councillors election, hoping to use a "completely renovated lineup" to win over the voters who had lost their trust.
    During this period, a new faction that attracted attention appeared within the Liberal Democratic Party—the "Reformists." They are composed of eighteen former Progressive Party members and Liberal Party members within the Liberal Democratic Party, including Shuji Kawasaki and Yoshio Namiki. Their purpose is to cultivate an "enterprising conservative party." According to the statement issued by this faction on June 14, they intend to restore normal relations with the Soviet Union and adjust basic relations with the United States in terms of diplomacy, including revising the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty.
    The reorganization plan of the Liberal Democratic Party and the Hatoyama Cabinet has been delayed due to internal opposition. After the failure of the House of Councillors election, the contradictions within the Liberal Democratic Party further deepened, and the demand for the reorganization of the cabinet and party personnel rose again. However, this time the demands mainly came from factions dissatisfied with Ichiro Hatoyama and the "Mainstream Faction," especially the former Liberal Party members who were pro-former Prime Minister Shigeru Yoshida. They took the opportunity to completely attribute the responsibility for the Liberal Democratic Party's failure in the House of Councillors election to the Hatoyama Cabinet, intending to stabilize the weakened ruling position of the Liberal Democratic Party and strengthen their influence within the party by sacrificing Hatoyama and his cabinet.
    At the same time, the deadline for the resumption of Soviet-Japanese negotiations (before July 31) is getting closer and closer. The "prudent faction" that advocates "taking it slowly" stepped up its obstruction activities, attempting to delay the reopening and smooth progress of the negotiations. Under their constraints, the weak Hatoyama Cabinet has been unable to decide on the candidates for plenipotentiary representatives, and even once wanted to invite Naotake Sato, a member of the Ryokufukai outside the party, to serve as the plenipotentiary representative in order to quell the internal strife within the party. However, this measure can only be met with more attacks. Finally, on July 13, it was decided to appoint Foreign Minister Mamoru Shigemitsu as the chief plenipotentiary representative, and former negotiator Shunichi Matsumoto remained as plenipotentiary representative. This repeated postponement and change in the selection of negotiators widened the rift between the related factions, and gave the anti-Hatoyama elements a new handle. The "Yoshida Faction" was particularly active among them, and fifty former Liberal Party members, including Hayato Ikeda and Namaji Hayashi, openly called for Ichiro Hatoyama to "retire," and resolved that Japan should adhere to the so-called territorial claims in the Japanese-Soviet negotiations and immediately send back the "detained personnel" in the Soviet Union. The arrogance of this part of the Liberal Democratic Party is to use the weakness of the Hatoyama Cabinet's "dual policy" to bomb it out of office and completely pull Japan back to the pro-American Yoshida line that has been proven unworkable.
    Faced with the increasingly powerful pressure of the people, the contradictions and instability within the Japanese conservative camp will develop more sharply. No matter how the future changes, one thing is certain, that is, the will of the people is unstoppable. The Japanese people demand to get rid of American control and embark on the road of peaceful and independent development. This is the only way to achieve stability in the Japanese political situation, and it is also the broad road leading to the prosperity and flourishing of the Japanese nation.

    演变中的日本政局   
    沈毓强
    日本的政治局势正在随着国际局势的发展起着引人注意的变化。这种演变反映了斗争着的两条路线的消长过程：要求和平独立的力量正在日益增长，而屈从美国、重整军备的势力在不断遭到失败。
    七月八日举行的参议院选举，是日本政局演变的一个重要标志。在这次选举中，社会党增加了十二席，共产党增加了一席。它们和进步的独立人士总共获得了八十六席，超过了参议院全部二百五十个议席的三分之一。这意味着，这些反对重整军备的党派的联合力量，已经阻止了以自由民主党为首的保守党派企图通过这次选举修改宪法的计划的实现。
    日本宪法是禁止日本参加战争和拥有战争力量的。这个规定成了美国重新武装日本的绊脚石。但是，要修改日本宪法，首先必须经过国会两院的三分之二多数的批准。而主张重新武装的自由民主党在国会两院的议席都不够这个数目。因此，它希望通过这次选举先在参议院取得三分之二的议席，然后一鼓作气，宣布解散众议院，利用重选的机会再在众议院达到同样的目的。但是，在参议院选举中，自由民主党的计划就遭到了选民的否决。选举结果，自由民主党只能维持它在改选前的席次——122席，还不到参议院全部议席的半数。同时，自由民主党在参议院的盟友绿风会，则从原来的四十三席激减到三十一席。这两个党派的议席的总和，也远不够三分之二的多数。在正常情况下，日本国会两院都要到三年以后再改选。修改宪法的计划在这三年中将遭到“冻结”。
    在这次参议院改选的竞选运动中，日本的外交政策问题占有很重要的地位。问题的焦点是日本要不要继续追随美国、加速重新武装；要不要迅速恢复日本同中国、苏联的正常关系。实质上，这就是日本要不要和平和奉行独立自主的政策的问题。自由民主党在选举中的失败，正是它的施政没有能够符合广大日本人民的意愿和利益的必然结果。
    美国对于日本参议院选举的结果感到十分不安。“纽约时报”认为，“必须把它看作是一个迹象，说明在日本存在着某种政治不稳定状态，说明对美国不大友好的趋势已经出现并且坚持下去……”美国的“每日镜报”认为，这次选举反映了日本的中立趋向。
    美国所担心的日本的中立趋向，实际上就是指的弥漫在日本的对于奉行和平独立政策的普遍的要求：反对美国继续占领日本、反对日本重新武装、要求改善同中国、苏联的关系、要求恢复日中贸易……。随着最近国际局势的进一步趋向和缓，随着亚非会议以后在全亚洲出现的和平地区的扩大和争取民族独立斗争的发展，以及美国对中国实施的“禁运”政策的破产，日本广大人民的这种要求变得越来越强烈，并且在日本国内政治局势中得到了鲜明的反映。社会党和共产党顺应着人民的要求，对自由民主党目前奉行的政策展开了有力的攻击，并且取得了胜利。
    这种斗争形势在这次参议院选举和六月间闭幕的国会第二十四次平时会议上表现得非常突出的。在这届会议中，自由民主党凭持它在国会中的多数，再加上一些粗野的手段，包括延长会期和出动警察殴打社会党议员，强行通过了1956年度预算、设立“国防会议”和“宪法调查会”的法案、新教育委员会法案等。这些法案是环绕着重新军国主义化这个同一的目的制定出来的。尽管如此，斗争的真正胜利者依然不是统治者，而是人民。当国会会议在六月三日闭幕的时候，还有三十项法案没有能够通过。其中最主要的是小选举区制的法案。这个法案是和修改宪法的计划直接相关的。因为选举区划小，将有助于执政党取得三分之二的多数。就在这次参院选举失败后，一部分保守人士流露出对这个法案被作废这件事不胜遗憾的情绪。
    两条路线的斗争也反映在自由民主党内部矛盾和分歧的擅长上。自由民主党内部本来就不稳定。它是日本保守党派的混合体，内部派系林立，利益冲突。
    随着国际和国内局势的发展，自由民主党内部各派系之间，在是否需要统一和改变政策来适应形势变化上，产生了尖锐的分歧，这种分歧特别表现在对苏日谈判和对中国的态度问题上。亲前首相吉田茂的前自由党分子坚持反对使苏日谈判达成协议，反对恢复中日关系正常化。他们支持和鼓励外务省首脑人物“慎重”进行日苏谈判的论调。而支持首相鸠山一郎的实际掌握政权的派系，主张早日使苏日谈判取得协议，以便取得舆论对自由民主党的同情和支持，从而巩固自己的统治。在日本人民的强烈要求和国际局势的不可抗拒的推动之下，鸠山政府采取了一些步骤来满足日本人民的要求，例如和苏联在渔业问题的谈判中达成了协议，并且同意在七月三十一日以前重开苏日谈判。鸠山政府也一再表示愿意改善同中国的关系，并且表示要跟着英国放宽对中国的“禁运”。同时，这些措施又进一步促进了自由民主党内部的矛盾。在五月间就盛传自由民主党和鸠山内阁的重要职务将有变动的消息。据透露，这种改组是为了统一党内和政府的意见，以利及早恢复日苏邦交；同时，也是着眼于这次参议院竞选，希望能以“全面革新的阵容”去争取因失信而失去的选民。
    在这个期间，在自由民主党内部出现了令人重视的新的派系——“改良派”。他们是由川崎秀二、并木芳雄等自由民主党内十八名前改进党人和自由党人组成的。他们的目的是要培养一个“有进取心的保守党”。根据这一派在六月十四日发表的声明，他们打算在外交方面恢复同苏联的正常关系和调整同美国的基本关系，其中包括修改日美安全条约。
    自由民主党和鸠山内阁的改组计划，由于内部的对立，迟迟没有能够实行。在参议院选举失败后，自由民主党内部的矛盾进一步加深，又兴起改组内阁和党的人事的要求。但是，这次的要求主要来自不满鸠山一郎和
  “主统派”的派系，特别是亲前首相吉田茂的前自由党人。它们乘机把自由民主党在参院选举中失败的责任完全推到鸠山内阁头上，打算用牺牲鸠山和他的内阁的办法，来稳定受到削弱的自由民主党的统治地位和加强自己在党内的势力。
    同时，日苏谈判恢复的期限（七月三十一日以前）愈来愈临近。主张“慢慢来”的“慎重派”加紧阻挠活动，企图拖延谈判的重开和顺利进展。在它们的牵制下，软弱的鸠山内阁迟迟不能决定全权代表的人选，甚至一度想请党外的绿风会议员佐藤尚武担任，以求平息党内的倾轧。但是，这种措施只能遭到更多的攻击。最后，在七月十三日才决定任命外务相重光葵为首席全权代表，前谈判代表松本俊一留任全权代表。这种在谈判代表人选上的一再迁延改变，扩大了有关派系的裂痕，并且授给了反鸠山分子以新的把柄。“吉田派”在其中显得特别活跃，池田勇人、林浪治等五十名前自由党人，公然提出要鸠山一郎“退休”，并且决议要日本在日苏谈判中坚持所谓领土要求和立即送回在苏联的“被扣人员”。自由民主党内这部分人的嚣张跋扈是想利用鸠山内阁“二元政策”的弱点，轰它下台，把日本完全拉回到已经被证明行不通的亲美的吉田路线上去。
    面临着愈来愈强大的人民的压力，日本保守阵营内部的矛盾和不稳将有更尖锐的发展。不论变化的前途如何，有一点是肯定的，就是人民的意志是不可阻挡的。日本人民要求摆脱美国的控制，走上和平和独立发展的道路。这是求得日本政局稳定的唯一的出路，也是导向日本民族繁荣兴盛的康庄大道。
