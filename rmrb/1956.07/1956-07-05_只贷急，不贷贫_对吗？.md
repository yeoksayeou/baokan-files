    Is "Only Lend to the Urgent, Not the Poor" Correct?
    The Xinhua Agricultural Cooperative in Changle Township, Haimen County, Jiangsu Province, stipulated the principle of "only lending to the urgent, not the poor" when distributing state-issued living loans. As a result, farmers who are genuinely in financial difficulty cannot obtain loans, while some relatively wealthy farmers borrow money under the pretext of "urgent need" to buy bicycles and fish and meat to eat. Does this align with the state's purpose of issuing living loans?

    “只贷急，不贷贫”对吗？
    江苏海门县常乐乡新宏农业社，代国家发放生活贷款规定了“只能贷急，不能贷贫”的原则。因此生活真正困难的农民得不到贷款，而某些生活较富裕的农民却在“急需”的借口下，贷款买自行车和鱼、肉吃。这符合国家发放生活贷款的目的吗？
