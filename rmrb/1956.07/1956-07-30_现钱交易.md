    "Cash Transactions"
    Ding Jing
    Whenever "cash transactions" are mentioned, people immediately think of the scene in the market where one hand gives money and the other receives goods. What I want to talk about here is only the "cash transactions" that appear in factories.
    This kind of "transaction" has various attractive names: some are called "sudden attack bonuses," where you have a chance to get a bonus as long as you are willing to work hard, work overtime, and complete the task. It is said that the director of a certain factory once held a stack of banknotes in his hand and shouted loudly: those who complete the production task within five days will receive a bonus of thirty yuan, and those who complete the task within four days will receive a bonus of sixty yuan, plus a prize flag. It’s really a combination of bonus and prize flag, gaining both fame and fortune. Some are called "comfort fees," which are characterized by not having a clear price tag, but rather acting at discretion to show gratitude. Some places bluntly call it "cash transactions," and post price lists to entice workers to work overtime.
    Some people believe that the form of cash transactions and overtime work is in line with the principles of voluntary mutual benefit and piece-rate wages. This is obviously a distortion. The principles of piece-rate wages and payment according to work are intended to make workers care about their labor results from the perspective of personal material interests and to encourage workers to improve technology and increase labor productivity. However, this must not be understood as allowing unlimited enticement of workers to work overtime, extend working hours, disregard health conditions, and violate labor protection regulations. Our country advocates creative labor, encourages everyone to improve labor tools, reduce labor intensity, and increase labor productivity. The state has specially formulated reward regulations to reward employees for their creations and inventions, and give them certain bonuses according to the value of the creations and inventions, which is in line with the personal interests of workers and the interests of the state. However, the state will never allow the use of bonuses to entice workers to work overtime and work desperately. Because this approach not only has no positive effect on labor production, but also directly violates the personal interests of workers and the interests of the state.
    Many leading comrades in enterprises, although they also know these principles, are unable to arrange production well or rationally organize labor. Therefore, when they encounter critical moments, they are at a loss and have to resort to overtime work. As a result, many names and forms have appeared in factories: "rotational rest," "make-up shifts," "adjusted shifts," "voluntary labor," and so on. According to incomplete statistics from Tangshan, Shijiazhuang, Zhangjiakou, Qinhuangdao and other cities in Hebei Province, a total of 1,437,155 hours of overtime work were recorded from January to April, equivalent to 179,644 working days. The working hours of some factories are as long as ten to twenty hours, and workers are dozing off even while eating and walking. Zhou Fengzhen, a worker at the Tangshan Power Plant, worked overtime for four consecutive days without rest. He fell asleep on the road while riding his bicycle home.
    In order to completely change this phenomenon, we need to make up our minds and earnestly and thoroughly learn scientific economic management work, and eliminate capitalist management thinking.

### “现钱交易”

    “现钱交易”
    丁井
    一提到“现钱交易”，人们就会想起市场上一手拿钱，一手拿货的情景。我这里要说的只是出现在工厂里的“现钱交易”。
    这种“交易”有着各种诱人的名目：有的叫“突击奖金”，只要你肯拚命干活，加班加点，完成任务，就有得奖的机会。据说某工厂厂长曾亲手拿着一叠钞票，大声疾呼地叫唤：五天内完成生产任务者奖金三十元，四天内完成任务者奖金六十元，另发奖旗一面。真是奖金加奖旗，名利双收。有叫“慰劳费”的，它的特点是没有明确的标价，只是酌情行事，聊表谢意。有的地方赤裸裸的叫做“现钱交易”，并且挂出牌价，以“现钱交易”引诱工人加班加点。
    有人认为现钱交易、加班加点的形式是符合于自愿两利、计件工资的原则。这显然是一种曲解。计件工资和按劳取酬的原则，是为了使工人从个人物质利益上来关心自己的劳动成果，激励工人改进技术，提高劳动生产率。但是，这绝不能理解为可以无限制地引诱工人加班加点，延长工时，不顾健康条件，违犯劳动保护规程。我们的国家提倡创造性的劳动，提倡大家改进劳动工具，降低劳动强度，提高劳动生产率，国家为了奖励职工的创造和发明，特地制定了奖励条例，按照创造发明的价值，给以一定的奖金，这是符合劳动者个人利益和国家利益的。但是，国家绝不允许利用奖金的名义诱骗工人加班加点，拚命干活。因为这种作法，不仅对劳动生产没有什么积极作用，而且直接违犯了劳动者的个人利益和国家利益。
    很多企业的领导同志们，他们虽然也知道这些道理，但是由于他们不善于安排生产，不善于合理组织劳动，因而一碰到紧要关头，就束手无策，只好乞救于加班加点了。于是在工厂里出现了许多名目和形式：“轮休”“补班”“调班”“义务劳动”等等。据河北省的唐山、石家庄、张家口、秦皇岛等市不完全统计，从一月到四月份共加班加点一百四十三万七千一百五十五个小时，共合十七万九千六百四十四个工作日。有的工厂的工时长达十几小时到二十小时，工人连吃饭走路都在打盹。唐山发电厂工人周凤珍连续加班四天没有休息，他在骑着自行车回家的时候就倒在路上睡着了。
    为了彻底改变这种现象，需要我们痛下决心，切实地深入地学好科学的经济管理工作，肃清资本主义经营思想。
