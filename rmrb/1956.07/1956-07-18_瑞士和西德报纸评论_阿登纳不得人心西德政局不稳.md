Xinhua News Agency dispatch: An article published in the "Journal de Genève" in early July stated: If the West German constitution, like the French one, only required one vote of no confidence, "perhaps Adenauer would have collapsed long ago."

The article was titled "Opposition to Adenauer's Internal Strife Intensifies." It described how all opposition parties were criticizing Adenauer, saying he was too old and too autocratic, and demanding that West Germany not rely solely on the West but should engage with the Soviet Union.

Even Germany's most outstanding editorial writers admit that the situation in the Federal Republic is becoming increasingly unstable, and Adenauer is becoming increasingly unpopular because people accuse him of not taking a positive attitude towards Moscow, Warsaw, and Prague.

West Germany's "Die Welt" wrote: Adenauer has become the target of everyone's, even his friends', venting their anger. The regime seems to be disintegrating. The old Chancellor's prestige seems to be declining daily, while the prestige of the opposition, which is preparing to seize power and turn the ship around, seems to be growing.

The article said: As long as this situation continues, it must be expected that relations between Germany and the Allies will soon experience a crisis, and the consequences for the Federal Republic may be terrible.

    瑞士和西德报纸评论
    阿登纳不得人心西德政局不稳
    据新华社讯　七月初的“日内瓦日报”刊载的一篇文章说：假若西德宪法像法国一样只需要一次不赞成投票就够了，“也许阿登纳早已垮了台”。
    这篇文章的题目是“反对阿登纳的内哄加紧了”。它描述各反对党派都在指责阿登纳，说他太老了，太专权了，都要求西德不要一味依靠西方，而要同苏联接触一下。
    连德国最出色的社论作家也承认：联邦共和国局势是越来越不稳定了，阿登纳越来越不得人心，因为人们指责他没有向着莫斯科、华沙和布拉格的方向采取积极的态度。
    西德的“世界报”写道：阿登纳成了大家、甚至他的朋友们发泄脾气的对象。政权似乎正在解体。老总理的威望看来日益下坠，同时准备取得政权来掉转船头的反对派的威望看来却在日益增长。
    文章说：只要这种情况继续下去，就得预料：德国和盟国的关系不久将经历一次危机，而其后果对于联邦共和国可能是可怕的。
