    Is This Supporting the New Factory?
    The expansion project of the state-owned Guangzhou Paper Mill is nearing completion this year, and a large number of new equipment are being put into production one after another. The need for skilled workers is more urgent than ever. However, look at what kind of support the state-owned Yingkou Paper Mill has given us at this time!
    Among the twenty-three skilled workers transferred from Yingkou Paper Mill to support our factory from last year to now, eight of them are unable to work regularly due to illness. Chen Gongming, a paper machine operator, suffers from severe heart disease; Fan Zhongqin, a fitter, is disabled in his leg and cannot persist in his work; and some are patients suffering from third-stage pulmonary tuberculosis, inguinal hernia, neurasthenia, and other diseases.
    Although these workers came to new positions with full enthusiasm, they are weak and sickly, and in addition, they are not accustomed to the southern climate, and their spirits are also very depressed. Because these workers often ask for leave, it also affects the factory's production. Six of the above eight people work on the No. 4 paper machine, which is staffed with four people per shift. Because they often ask for leave, there are only three people working per shift. For twenty days, there were only two people per shift, and product quality and output were affected to a certain extent.
    It is hoped that Yingkou Paper Mill will correct this act of departmentalism.

    这是支援新厂吗？
    国营广州造纸厂今年的扩建工程已经接近完成，大批新设备正陆续投入生产，需要技术熟练的工人比任何时候都迫切。但是，请看就在这时候，国营营口造纸厂给了我们一些什么样的支援呢！
    营口造纸厂从去年到现在调来支援我厂的二十三名技术工人里，因为生病不能经常工作的就有八名，抄纸看网工陈功明患有严重的心脏病，钳工范忠勤腿部残废，不能坚持工作，还有些是患三期肺结核、小肠疝气、神经衰弱等症的病人。
    这些工人虽然满腔热情地到新的岗位来工作，无奈体弱多病，再加上不习惯南方的气候，精神也很苦闷。由于这些工人经常请假，也影响了厂里的生产。上述八个人中有六个人在四号抄浆机工作，这台机器定员是每班四个人，由于他们经常请假，每班只有三个人工作，有二十天期间，每班只有两个人，产品质量、产量都受到一定的影响。
    希望营口造纸厂纠正这种本位主义的作法。
