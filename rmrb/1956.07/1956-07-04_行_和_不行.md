    "It Can Be Done" and "It Can't Be Done"
    Fan Rongkang
    In factories or on construction sites, if someone says, "It can't be done! Materials can't keep up, the plan is too ambitious, it's difficult to complete," this is usually criticized as right-leaning conservatism.

    If someone says, "It can be done! A bigger plan is fine, no problem," regardless of whether it's really "no problem" or not, it is often regarded as a "new atmosphere" and called a sign of a high tide in industrial production or industrial construction.

    One says "it can't be done," and the other says "it can be done." There seems to be a clear distinction between conservatism and progressiveness. However, on closer reflection, such rash judgments are not necessarily correct. Take the supply of materials as an example, this is an important factor in determining the plan. A very important part of the planning balance is the material balance. The so-called "acting according to one's capabilities" includes the issue of material resources. If the materials are clearly not enough, but the plan is still ambitious, and someone objects, saying "it can't be done," this is being pragmatic. How can we pin a right-leaning conservative label on them? If the materials are clearly not enough, but this is ignored, and only quantity and speed are pursued, then this, if a judgment is to be made, leans towards blind and reckless advance. How can this be called a "new atmosphere"?

    However, some people are indeed not interested in objective, existing problems such as the lack of materials. They don't like others to say "it can't be done," regardless of whether it really can't be done, and only like others to say "it can be done," regardless of whether it really can be done.

    Please look at the following matter!

    The Zha Zi vertical shaft in the Tonghua mining area was originally planned to start construction in April of this year, but was brought forward to December of last year. After construction began, the plan was not completed for a long time. One of the most important reasons was the lack of materials. Some comrades in the engineering department believed that this was the result of starting construction early. They said, "Steel and cement are allocated uniformly by the state, and many projects have started construction early, so there is a difficulty in supply falling short of demand."

    Some people disagreed with this view. Comrades Cheng Mozhi and Xiao Lan published an article in the Jilin Daily entitled "Don't Blame Objective Conditions When You Fail to Complete the Plan," criticizing this view, saying, "Steel and cement are allocated uniformly by the state, which has nothing to do with the lack of materials. The problem is whether the order plan was submitted as early as possible. They didn't place an order until more than a month after construction started, so how can they blame the state for allocating materials late?"

    I have not conducted an investigation in Zha Zi vertical shaft and originally had no right to speak. The criticisms of comrades Cheng Mozhi and Xiao Lan may be mostly correct. The work of the Zha Zi vertical shaft engineering department may indeed have many shortcomings. However, from the point of view of the lack of materials alone, "blaming the state for allocating materials late" is certainly not right, but the criticism of comrades Cheng and Xiao is also not convincing, and some views of some comrades in the engineering department are in line with the actual situation.

    Not having "submitted the order plan as early as possible," and "not placing an order until more than a month after construction started" are indeed shortcomings in the work of the Zha Zi vertical shaft engineering department. The criticism of comrades Cheng and Xiao is correct on this point. However, they have overlooked the other aspect of the problem. That is, although steel and cement are allocated uniformly by the state, and although the "order plan should be submitted as early as possible," this does not mean that as long as an order plan is submitted, the materials will flow in. Because the reason why our country's economy is called a planned economy is that it is not acting independently. On the one hand, it is from bottom to top, and on the other hand, it is from top to bottom. The state cannot respond to every unit's production and construction plan. It must balance it according to the policies of the Party and the state, according to the specific situation of the national economy, and according to many factors such as human, financial, and material resources. Less will be increased, slow will be accelerated, too much will be reduced, and too fast will be postponed. At present, there are indeed many difficulties in the state's material allocation work. Therefore, some projects may be postponed or even temporarily suspended because steel and cement cannot be supplied for a while. This is by no means a problem that can be solved by whether or not the "order plan is submitted as early as possible." As for the Zha Zi vertical shaft engineering department, which not only has no reserve materials, but also has not even placed an order, and then rashly started construction, it can only be said that it did not see the objective difficulties and blindly pursued impossible "speed."

    Comrades Cheng Mozhi and Xiao Lan do not quite understand this principle, and are also not very good at distinguishing between "it can be done" and "it can't be done" in actual work. They only saw that the construction plan of the Zha Zi vertical shaft failed month after month, and only saw that "an order was not placed until more than a month after construction started," and then stood up to criticize. Although the intention was good, they did not look at the problem comprehensively, and as a result, the original intention was to criticize other people's negative emotions, but instead revealed their own impatience. Holding this kind of impatient emotion, obliterating the actual objective difficulties, does not have much positive effect on the work.

    Of course, this does not mean that all units can sit and wait for materials. The general situation at present is that materials are in short supply, but various units can still give play to their initiative, actively think of ways, and solve some problems within a certain range. The Zha Zi vertical shaft engineering department can check the extent of its efforts in this regard. The Nanjing Xinhua Daily published an article on June 18, introducing the work experience of the supply section of the Nanjing Machine Tool Factory, which is very meaningful. The factory's demand for steel in the first quarter of this year increased three times compared with the same period last year, but only one-third of the materials could be purchased. They actively cleared the warehouse, looked for substitutes, used waste materials, and contacted fraternal units, and finally ensured the supply. Doesn't this show that it is still possible to turn "it can't be done" into "it can be done"?

    In actual work, there are real "it can be done," and there are real "it can't be done"; there are those who say "it can't be done" when "it can be done," and there are those who say "it can be done" when "it can't be done"; there are those who can turn "it can't be done" into "it can be done" but do not actively try to change. These various situations cannot be tolerated, nor can they be rushed. Tolerating them protects right-leaning conservatism, and rushing them fosters blind and reckless advance. Those who write articles should think again and again before putting pen to paper, and those who make suggestions should think again and again before opening their mouths. To regard "it can't be done" as conservative and blame it as negative, to praise "it can be done" as positive and praise it as advanced, without studying the actual situation, is a very bad tendency. Especially now, when blind and reckless advance has grown after opposing right-leaning conservatism, it is even more necessary to listen to the opinions of those who say "it can't be done," and to study whether those who say "it can be done" are really capable.

### “行”和“不行”

    “行”和“不行”
    范荣康
    在工厂里，或者是在建筑工地上，要是有人说：“不行呵！材料供应不上，计划订得太大了，很难完成”，这通常都要被批评为右倾保守。
    要是有人说：“行呵！计划订大些，没有什么问题”，不管是不是真的“没有什么问题”，却常被人视为“新气象”，称为工业生产高潮或工业建设高潮来到的标志。
    一个说“不行”，一个说“行”，看来确有保守与先进之别。然而，细细思想，这样妄下断语，却未必是正确的。就拿材料供应来说，这是确定计划的一个重要因素。计划平衡工作中一个很重要的部分就是材料平衡，所谓“量力而行”，里面就有一个物力问题。材料分明供应不上，计划却订得老大的，有人提出来反对，说“不行”，这是实事求是，怎么能扣一顶右倾保守的帽子呢？材料分明供应不上，却撇开不管，一味求多、求快，这要下断语的话，倒有几分盲目冒进，怎么能称之为“新气象”呢？
    可是，确实有些人对材料供应不上等客观存在的实际问题不感兴趣，他们不喜欢别人说“不行”，不管是不是真的不行，只喜欢别人说“行”，也不管是不是真的行。
    请看下面这件事情吧！
    通化矿区砟子立井原计划今年四月动工，后来提前在去年十二月动工了。动工之后，长期完不成计划。其中一个很重要的原因是材料供应不上。工程处的一些同志认为这是提前动工的结果，他们说：“钢材、水泥由国家统一调拨，许多工程都提前动工，所以发生了供不应求的困难。”
    有些人不同意这种看法。程谟志，晓兰两同志就以“不要完不成计划就埋怨客观条件”为题，在吉林日报上发表文章，批判这种看法说：“钢材，水泥归国家统一调拨，这与材料供应不上并没有什么关系，问题是是否尽先提出订货计划，他们直到开工一个多月了才去订货，这又怎能怪国家调拨材料晚呢？”
    我没有到砟子立井作过调查研究，本来没有发言权。程谟志、晓兰两同志的批评也许大都是正确的。砟子立井工程处的工作也许确实有许多缺点。不过，单从材料供应不上这一点来看，“怪国家调拨材料晚”当然不对，但程、晓两同志的批评也是不能令人信服的，工程处一些同志的有些看法倒是符合实际情况的。
    没有“尽先提出订货计划”，“直到开工一个多月了才去订货”，确实是砟子立井工程处工作中的缺点。程、晓两同志的批评，在这一点上是对的。只是他们忽略了问题的另一方面。这就是虽然钢材和水泥是由国家统一调拨的，虽然应该“尽先提出订货计划”，可是，这并不等于只要一提订货计划，材料就源源而来。因为我们国家的经济所以叫作计划经济，乃在于它不是各自为政的，它一方面自下而上，另一方面又自上而下。国家对于各个单位的生产和建设计划，不能有求必应，它要根据党和国家的政策，根据国民经济的具体情况，根据人力、财力、物力等多方面的因素来进行平衡，少则增多，慢则加快，太多则削减，太快则推迟。当前国家材料调拨工作的确存在很多困难，因此某些工程完全可能因为钢材水泥一时供应不上而延期开工，甚至暂时停工。这就决不是是否“尽先提出订货计划”所能解决的问题了，至于砟子立井工程处不但没有储备材料，而且连订货还没有提，就贸然开工，更只能说是没有看见客观存在的困难，就盲目追求不可能实现的“速度”。
    程谟志、晓兰两同志不大明白这个道理，也还不大善于区别在实际工作中的“行”和“不行”，他们只看见砟子立井的建设计划月月落空，只看见“直到开工一个多月了才去订货”，就站出来批评，用心虽好，只是看问题不全面，因而原意是要批评别人的消极情绪，结果反而露出自己的急躁情绪。持这种急躁情绪，抹杀实际存在的客观困难，对工作是没有多少积极作用的。
    当然，这并不是说一切单位都可以坐待材料。目前总的情况是材料紧张，但各个单位还是可以发挥主动性，积极想办法，在一定范围内解决一些问题的。砟子立井工程处倒是可以检查一下在这方面的努力程度。六月十八日南京新华日报发表了一篇文章，介绍南京机床厂供应科的工作经验，就很有意义。这个工厂今年第一季度需要的钢材比去年同期增加了三倍，能够采购到的材料却只有三分之一，他们积极清理仓库，找代用品，利用废料，和兄弟单位联系，终于保证了供应，不是说明变“不行”为“行”也还是有可能的吗？
    实际工作中有真“行”的，有真“不行”的；有“行”而说“不行”的，有“不行”而说“行”的；有可以变“不行”为“行”而不积极设法去变的。对此种种，不可姑息，也不可急躁，姑息则保护了右倾保守，急躁则助长了盲目冒进。写文章的在动笔之前，提意见的在开口之前，要再思再想，闻“不行”就指为保守，责为消极，闻“行”就赞为积极，誉为先进，全不研究实际情况，是一种很不好的倾向。特别是在现在，当反对了右倾保守之后，盲目冒进有所滋长的时候，更需要多听听说“不行”的人的意见，多研究研究说“行”的人是不是真行。
