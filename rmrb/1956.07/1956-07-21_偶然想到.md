People who hang mottoes on their walls don't necessarily act in accordance with them; those who are down-to-earth and work hard generally don't hang mottoes. Hanging a motto only indicates ambition; practice is what turns hope into reality.

"This person likes to show off!"
        Thus, showing off becomes a shortcoming.
"This person shows off well!"
        Thus, showing off becomes a virtue.

Showing off is necessary, but the pronunciation and placement of the word "well" is determined by oneself.

    偶然想到

    座右挂着格言的人，行为未必符合格言；脚踏实地、埋头苦干的人，大抵不挂格言。挂格言只标示出志向，实践才能把希望变成现实。
    “这个人好表现！”
    于是表现成了缺点。
    “这个人表现好！”
    于是表现成了优点。
    表现是要的，只是“好”字的读音和位置的安排，却决定于自己。
