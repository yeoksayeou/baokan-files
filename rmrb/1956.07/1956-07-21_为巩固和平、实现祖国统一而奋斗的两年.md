Two years have passed since the restoration of peace in Vietnam.

According to the Geneva Accords, authorities in both North and South Vietnam were to convene consultative conferences from July 20, 1955, and hold free general elections nationwide within July 1956 to reunify the country.

However, there have been no consultations this year, and no general elections have been held this July as stipulated by the Geneva Accords.

Who is responsible for this grave situation?

The entire Vietnamese people and all peace-loving people in the world know that the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has consistently and strictly implemented the Geneva Accords, and has repeatedly suggested to the Southern authorities that normal relations between the two regions be restored, consultative conferences be convened, and free general elections be discussed to unify the country.

However, Ngo Dinh Diem, following the orders of U.S. imperialism, has consistently rejected all suggestions from the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, using the excuse that the Southern authorities did not sign the Geneva Accords and therefore bear no responsibility for the agreements. Moreover, U.S. imperialism and Ngo Dinh Diem are implementing a suffocating dictatorial system in the South and are turning the South into a U.S. military base and dependency, preparing to re-launch the war.

U.S. imperialism and Ngo Dinh Diem are responsible for the current grave situation in Vietnam. They are openly hostile to the entire Vietnamese people and all peace-loving people in the world.

U.S. imperialism and Ngo Dinh Diem deliberately sabotage the Geneva Accords, but the Vietnamese people have already fought and won, and facilitated the signing of the Geneva Accords. We must rely on this legal basis to continue fighting for the peace, unification, independence, democracy, and prosperity of Vietnam. This struggle is essentially to complete the tasks of the national democratic revolution nationwide, and it will inevitably be a long and arduous one, but it will surely be victorious.

In order to achieve victory, the Vietnamese people, under the leadership of the Vietnam Labor Party, the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and President Ho Chi Minh, are coordinating struggles on three fronts to continuously strengthen their own power: striving to consolidate the North, persisting in and developing the patriotic movement of compatriots in the South, and winning the sympathy of peace-loving people all over the world.

The past two years have been a very important journey in this struggle. We have failed to hold general elections within the time limit stipulated by the Geneva Accords to unify the country, but we are strengthening our own power in all aspects, laying a good foundation for continuing the struggle to achieve complete victory.

The main and greatest victory that the Vietnamese people have achieved in the past two years is that North Vietnam has been completely liberated and has begun to consolidate.

The North has shaken off imperialist rule and achieved complete liberation. Land reform has been basically completed, and the thousands-year-old rule of the feudal landlord class has been destroyed. Land reform has liberated the productive forces of the countryside, making peasants and workers a close alliance, masters of the country, and masters of society. The land reform in the North has forever destroyed the reliance of imperialist aggressors and has also created fundamental conditions for the development of a people's democratic system in the North. The democratic system in the North thoroughly realizes national independence and various rights to democratic freedom, and is constantly developing, gradually moving towards socialism, becoming a component of the socialist camp.

The completely liberated North is a peaceful region with good conditions for construction, enabling us to move towards prosperity and build a solid foundation for the struggle to unify the country. This is being realized. Since the restoration of peace, we have utilized all favorable conditions to strive to restore the economy and develop culture in order to gradually improve the people's living standards.

In the early days of liberation, farmers in many places were starving, many places lacked food, agricultural tools, and cattle, and many places even lacked labor. In addition, natural disasters such as floods, droughts, winds, and insects followed one after another. The imperialist lackeys also insidiously sabotaged production. Thanks to the centralized leadership of the Party and the government and the efforts of the entire people, these difficulties have gradually been resolved or alleviated.

In terms of industry and commerce, we have also overcome many major difficulties. When the imperialists and their lackeys withdrew, they implemented a plan of comprehensive destruction, attempting to plunge our industrial production and people's lives, especially in the cities, into difficulties. The "family fortune" we took over was very small and was an economy completely subordinate to imperialist countries, serving the war of aggression. This situation posed a heavy task: to restore industry, mainly handicrafts and small crafts, and to change the nature of all economic activities, develop them in new directions, serve the people's lives, and build an independent and autonomous economy. The basic favorable condition for us is that the Vietnamese working class has become the master of factories and mines, giving full play to their enthusiasm and creativity, and contributing their strength to rebuilding the motherland. We have also received selfless assistance from fraternal countries in terms of materials, equipment, and technology. In this way, industry has gradually recovered, and commerce has also recovered and is being adjusted.

Dozens of new factories are under construction, and the Hanoi-Munankwan and Hanoi-Laocai railways and the Haiphong port have been restored one after another. They connect the cities and the countryside and connect with other countries.

Due to the recovery of production, we have partially solved the unemployment problem left over from the old system and have begun to improve the lives of workers, staff, and cadres. In the countryside, farmers' incomes have begun to increase, and their burdens have begun to lighten.

The increasing consolidation of the North demonstrates that the democratic republican system is superior to the U.S. and Ngo Dinh Diem's system in the South. In the struggle for national reunification, this is a powerful mobilizing force for compatriots in the South. The consolidation of the North is a guarantee of peace in Vietnam and a solid foundation for the struggle to unify the country through peaceful means. The consolidation of the North is the main condition for gathering our strength more broadly, making U.S. imperialism and its lackeys even more isolated in the South.

Therefore, consolidating the North is a key task in the cause of struggling to achieve national reunification. Therefore, the fact that the North has begun to be consolidated is the main victory of the Vietnamese people in the past two years.

In the South, despite the brutal suppression by U.S. imperialism and Ngo Dinh Diem, the patriotic movement of compatriots in the South has been able to persist and develop.

Under the dictatorial system of U.S. imperialism and Ngo Dinh Diem, the lives of compatriots in the South are very painful. Economically, the monopoly policy of U.S. imperialism has caused economic panic and serious unemployment. Militarily, Ngo Dinh Diem is desperately conscripting soldiers, strengthening the army, and building military bases in order to prepare for war. Politically, the people have no freedom or democracy, and their lives and property are not guaranteed. Ngo Dinh Diem's public security, police, and intelligence agencies are expanding day by day, like a large net, closely controlling the people.

This dictatorial system of the U.S. imperialist lackeys—a small number of comprador bourgeois and the most reactionary feudal class—weighs heavily on the heads of the people of all strata, arousing public indignation and generating a universal anti-American, anti-Ngo Dinh Diem sentiment. Therefore, the power of U.S. imperialism and Ngo Dinh Diem is no different from a building built on the beach. This profound contradiction between all compatriots in the South and U.S. imperialism and Ngo Dinh Diem is the fundamental factor that enables the patriotic movement in the South to persist and develop.

In the past two years, there have been many large-scale mass struggles: against revenge and massacres, against "controlling the Communists," demanding the restoration of normal relations between the two regions, demanding the holding of consultative conferences to discuss the issue of general elections, opposing the false solicitation of public opinion, opposing the election of the "Southern National Assembly." These struggles have appeared in various very flexible forms, raising the level of awareness of the masses, strengthening the unity and struggle strength of the masses, and also winning the sympathy of many people in the Southern government agencies.

This patriotic movement is constantly expanding in the countryside, plantations, enterprises, schools..., among hundreds of thousands of farmers, workers, and students. The Vietnam Fatherland Front was established, and its program was disseminated among the people of all strata in the South, winning widespread sympathy and support.

Diplomatically, the struggle of the Vietnamese people is proceeding under favorable conditions and has won the sympathy and support of the people and governments of all peace-loving countries in the world.

The current world situation is undergoing many changes that are favorable to the camps of peace, democracy, and socialism. The views of the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union are a beacon for the revolutionary movements of various countries.

Socialism has become a world system, and the zone of peaceful neutrality is expanding. These situations are conducive to the just struggle of the Vietnamese people.

The Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam is striving to carry out peaceful construction in North Vietnam, consistently and strictly implementing the Geneva Accords, sincerely cooperating with the International Commission, and adopting various methods to establish friendly relations with neighboring countries and Southeast Asia and all peace-loving countries in the world. Implementing a policy of peace, proceeding from national interests, is in line with the interests of world peace. The Vietnamese people and the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam have won the widespread sympathy and support of peace-loving countries, especially fraternal countries and Asian and African countries. This sympathy and support is a great encouragement to the Vietnamese people and, at the same time, makes U.S. imperialism and Ngo Dinh Diem increasingly isolated at home and abroad. The Vietnamese people cherish this support full of the spirit of justice and are determined to work hard to advance the struggle for the peaceful reunification of their nation, so as to contribute a part to the common cause of peace for progressive mankind.

Relying on the resolute will of the Vietnamese people from North to South, and relying on the broad sympathy and support of world public opinion, we firmly believe that all conspiracies of U.S. imperialism and Ngo Dinh Diem to abolish the Geneva Accords will surely fail. In the recent letters from the two chairmen of the Geneva Conference to the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the Southern authorities, the two chairmen emphasized that the authorities of North and South Vietnam should convene consultative conferences as soon as possible to discuss the issue of free general elections nationwide in order to unify the whole of Vietnam in accordance with the spirit stipulated in the Geneva Accords. The Vietnamese people's strong will to fight for unification and the broad sympathy and support of world public opinion for the Vietnamese people's struggle are effective guarantees for maintaining the legal value of the Geneva Accords.

Relying on the strong unity at home and abroad, and constantly holding high the banner of peace, unification, and justice, the Vietnamese people have a practical basis to firmly believe in their glorious tomorrow of victory.

The three-pronged task of the political struggle of the entire Party and the entire people of Vietnam in the past two years has achieved initial victories. We must strive to overcome various difficulties, correct various shortcomings, and develop the various achievements already obtained. Only through long-term struggle can we achieve the goal of consolidating peace and unifying the motherland on the basis of independence and democracy.

Through two years of peaceful struggle, we have summarized a few important experiences: the line of struggling to achieve national reunification through peaceful means is currently the most correct and the most beneficial to us. The banner of peaceful reunification is a banner of justice, and it can broadly gather various forces to complete the national democratic revolution on a nationwide scale. The Vietnamese people are determined to always defend the peace they have already won and continue to fight for the implementation of the Geneva Accords in order to achieve the reunification of the motherland, but they also constantly maintain vigilance and are always ready to deal with all the conspiracies of U.S. imperialism and its lackeys.

The policy of consolidating the North and taking care of the South has been appropriately put forward. The North is the foundation for struggling to achieve national reunification. Therefore, the North must be consolidated under all circumstances. At the same time, in all policies for consolidating the North, the spirit of taking care of the South must be implemented, and special attention should be paid to correctly implementing various policies and doing a good job in various tasks of consolidating the North in order to effectively take care of the South.

Under the illumination of the light of practical struggle in the country and the light of the resolutions of the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the entire Vietnamese people firmly believe in the line of the Vietnam Labor Party, the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and President Ho Chi Minh, firmly believe in their own strength of unity and struggle and the support of fraternal countries and the people and governments of peace-loving countries, and firmly believe in Vietnam's glorious tomorrow of peace, unification, independence, democracy, and prosperity.

    为巩固和平、实现祖国统一而奋斗的两年
    越南劳动党中央执行委员会委员　阮维桢
    越南恢复和平刚好两年了。
    根据日内瓦协议，越南南、北双方当局要从1955年7月20日起召开协商会议，并在1956年7月内，在全国范围内举行自由普选，以便统一祖国。
    但是，今年一直没有协商，今年七月也没有按照日内瓦协议的规定举行普选。
    是谁造成这种严重的情况？
    越南全体人民和全世界爱好和平的人士都知道，越南民主共和国政府始终严格执行日内瓦协议，并且曾多次向南方当局建议，恢复两个地区之间的正常关系，召开协商会议，讨论自由普选以统一祖国。
    但是吴庭艳遵从美帝国主义的命令，始终拒绝越南民主共和国政府的一切建议，借口南方当局没有在日内瓦协议上签字，而对协议不负责任。而且，美帝国主义和吴庭艳正在南方实行一种令人窒息的独裁制度，并正使南方变成美国的军事基地和属地，准备重新发动战争。
    美帝国主义和吴庭艳要对目前越南的严重情况负责。他们公然与全体越南人民以及全世界爱好和平人士为敌。
    美帝国主义和吴庭艳蓄意破坏日内瓦协议，但是越南人民已经斗争胜利，并且促成了日内瓦协议的签订，我们一定要凭借这种法理，为越南的和平、统一、独立、民主和富强继续斗争到底。这一场斗争实质上是要在全国范围内完成民族民主革命任务，它必然是长期、艰苦的，但是一定会获得胜利。
    为了争取胜利，越南人民在越南劳动党、越南民主共和国政府和胡志明主席的领导下，正配合三方面的斗争来不断增强自己的力量：努力巩固北方，坚持并发展南方同胞的爱国运动，争取全世界爱好和平人士的同情。
    过去两年是这场斗争所经历的一段非常重要的路程。我们未能按照日内瓦协议规定的期限举行普选以便统一祖国，但我们正在从各方面增强自己的力量，为继续斗争以达到完全胜利建立良好的基础。
    越南人民在过去两年中所获得的主要的和最大的胜利是：越南北方已经完全解放，并且开始巩固。
    北方摆脱了帝国主义的统治，获得了完全的解放，土地改革基本已经完成，封建地主阶级数千年的统治制度被摧毁。土地改革解放了农村的生产力，使农民和工人紧密联盟，成为国家的主人、社会的主人。北方的土地改革，永远摧毁帝国主义者侵略的依靠，同时也为在北方发展人民民主制度创造根本的条件。北方的民主制度彻底实现了民族独立和民主自由的各种权利，并且不断发展，逐步走向社会主义，成为社会主义阵营的一个组成部分。
    完全解放了的北方是一个和平地区，有很好的建设条件，使我们走向富强，为统一祖国的斗争建立巩固的基础。这件事正在实现。自从和平恢复以来，我们利用了一切有利条件，努力恢复经济，发展文化，以便逐步提高人民生活的水平。
    刚刚解放的那些日子，许多地方的农民挨饿，许多地方缺粮、缺农具、缺牛马，许多地方连劳动力也缺少，加上水、旱、风、虫等灾害……接踵而来。帝国主义者的走狗还阴险地破坏生产。由于党和政府的集中领导，由于全体人民的努力，这些困难逐渐得到解决或减轻。
    工商业方面，我们也克服了许多重大困难。帝国主义者及其走狗们在撤退的时候，实行了一种全面破坏的计划，企图使我们的工业生产和人民生活，特别是各城市毁于困境。我们所接收下来的“家财”很少，并且还是一种完全附属于帝国主义国家的为侵略战争服务的经济。这种情形提出了一个沉重的任务，必须恢复工业，主要是手工业和小工艺，并且改变一切经济活动的性质，向新方面发展，为人民生活服务，建设独立自主的经济。对我们有利的基本条件是，越南工人阶级成为工厂、矿山的主人，彻底发挥了他们的积极性和创造性，为重建祖国贡献自己的力量。我们还得到各兄弟国家在物资、装备和技术方面无私的援助。这样，工业逐渐恢复了，商业也已经恢复并进行调整。
    几十个新工厂正在建设，河内—睦南关和河内—老街的铁路以及海防的港口相继恢复了。它们把城市和乡村连接起来，并且和各国相通。
    由于生产的恢复，我们已经部分解决了旧制度遗留下来的失业问题，并且开始改善职工和干部的生活。在农村，农民的收入开始增加，负担开始减轻。
    北方日益巩固，说明了民主共和制度比南方的美国和吴庭艳的制度优越。在为祖国统一而进行的斗争中，对于南方同胞，这是一种强大的动员力量。北方的巩固是越南和平的保证，是通过和平方式为统一祖国而斗争的坚固基础。北方的巩固是更广泛地集结我们的力量的主要条件，而使得美帝国主义和它的走狗在南方更加孤立。
    因此，巩固北方在为实现祖国的统一而斗争的事业中是一项带有关键性的任务。因此，北方开始获得巩固是过去两年中越南人民的主要胜利。
    在南方，尽管美帝国主义和吴庭艳实行野蛮的镇压，南方同胞的爱国运动仍然能够坚持和发展。
    在美帝国主义和吴庭艳的独裁制度下，南方同胞的生活非常痛苦。经济方面，美帝国主义的垄断政策造成了经济恐慌和严重的失业现象。军事方面，吴庭艳为了准备战争，拼命抓壮丁，加强军队，建设军事基地。政治方面，人民没有丝毫自由民主，生命财产都得不到保障。吴庭艳的公安、警察和特务机关日益扩大，像一个大网一样，严密地控制着人民。
    美帝国主义的走狗们——少数买办资产阶级和最反动的封建阶级的这种独裁制度，沉重地压在各阶层人民的头上，引起人民的公愤，普遍产生一种反美、反吴庭艳的倾向。因此，美帝国主义和吴庭艳的势力，无异于建筑在沙滩上的楼台。南方全体同胞和美帝国主义与吴庭艳之间的这种深刻矛盾，是南方的爱国运动能够坚持和发展的根本因素。
    在过去两年中，曾发生过许多次大规模的群众斗争；反对报仇屠杀，反对“控共”，要求恢复两个地区的正常关系，要求举行协商会议以讨论普选问题，反对虚伪的征求民意，反对选举“南方国会”。……这些斗争以各种非常灵活的形式出现，提高了群众的觉悟水平，加强了群众的团结斗争力量，并且还争取到了南方政权机构中许多人的同情。
    这种爱国运动，在农村，庄园、企业、学校……里；在成千上万的农民、工人、学生中不断扩大。越南祖国阵线成立，它的纲领在南方各阶层人民中传播，获得了广泛的同情和拥护。
    外交方面，越南人民的斗争正在顺利的条件下进行，并且取得了全世界爱好和平各国的人民和政府的同情和拥护。
    目前的世界形势正有许多有利于和平、民主和社会主义阵营的变化。苏联共产党第二十次代表大会的各种观点，是各国革命运动的指路明灯。
    社会主义已经成为一个世界体系，和平中立区域正在扩大，这些情况有利于越南人民的正义斗争。
    越南民主共和国政府正在越南北方努力进行和平建设，一贯严格履行日内瓦协议，和国际委员会诚实合作，并且采取各种办法同各邻国和东南亚以及全世界爱好和平各国建立友谊关系。贯彻实行了和平政策，从民族利益出发，这是符合于世界和平的利益的。越南人民和越南民主共和国政府获得了爱好和平各国，特别是各兄弟国家和亚非各国的广泛同情和拥护。这种同情和拥护对于越南人民是一种很大的鼓舞，同时，使美帝国主义和吴庭艳在国内和国际上日益孤立。越南人民非常宝贵这种充满着正义精神的支持，并决心努力推进为自己民族的和平统一而进行的斗争，借以为进步人类的共同和平事业贡献一部分力量。
    依靠越南人民从北至南的坚决斗争的意志，依靠全世界舆论的广泛同情和拥护，我们坚信美帝国主义和吴庭艳企图废除日内瓦协议的一切阴谋一定失败。在日内瓦会议两位主席最近寄给越南民主共和国政府和南方政权的信中，两位主席强调指出，越南北方和南方的当局应该早日召开协商会议，讨论全国自由普选的问题，以便按照日内瓦协议所规定的精神，统一全越南。越南人民为统一而斗争的坚强意志以及全世界舆论对越南人民的斗争所表示的广泛同情和拥护，是保持日内瓦协议的法理价值的有效保证。
    依靠国内，国外的坚强团结力量，经常高举和平、统一和正义的旗帜，越南人民具有实际的基础，可以坚信自己的光荣胜利的明天。
    越南全党和全体人民过去两年的政治斗争任务的三方面工作已经获得初步胜利。我们必须努力克服各种困难，纠正各种缺点并且发展已经获得的各种成绩，经过长期奋斗才能达到巩固和平，在独立和民主的基础上统一祖国的目的。
    经过两年的和平斗争，我们总结了几点重要经验：通过和平方式实现祖国统一的斗争路线在目前是最正确的并且是对我们最有利的。和平统一的旗帜是正义的旗帜，它能够广泛地集结各种力量，来完成全国范围内的民族民主革命。越南人民决定始终保卫已经获得的和平，继续为执行日内瓦协议而斗争，以便实现祖国的统一，但也经常提高警惕性，随时准备对付美帝国主义和它的走狗的一切阴谋。
    巩固北方、照顾南方的方针已经恰当地提出来了。北方是为实现祖国统一而斗争的基础。因此，北方在一切情况之下都必须获得巩固。同时，在一切为了巩固北方的政策中，必须贯彻照顾南方的精神，并且特别应该正确执行各种政策，做好各种巩固北方的工作，以便切实地照顾南方。
    在国内实际斗争的明灯和苏联共产党第二十次代表大会决议的明灯的照耀下，越南全体人民非常相信越南劳动党、越南民主共和国政府和胡主席的路线，非常相信自己的团结斗争力量和各兄弟国家以及爱好和平各国的人民和政府的支援，并且非常相信越南获得和平、统一、独立、民主和富强的光荣的明天。
