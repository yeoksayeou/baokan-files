Strengthening Soil and Water Conservation Work in the Upper Reaches of the Yongding River

    (Our report) The Zhangjiakou Special District of Hebei Province is strengthening soil and water conservation work in the mountainous areas of the upper reaches of the Yongding River. In the past six months, the sixteen counties in the entire special district have built soil and water conservation projects covering an area of more than 1.5 million mu. These projects have effectively reduced soil erosion in the upper reaches of the Yongding River and are playing a positive role in protecting the Guanting Reservoir and agricultural production in the mountainous areas.

    In the process of carrying out soil and water conservation work, the farmers are simultaneously carrying out afforestation on closed hillsides, digging canals, building earth dikes, stone dams, and small reservoirs, and planting crops in these areas. For example, it is estimated that the beans planted in fish-scale pits in Changjiagou, Huai'an County, this year will yield more than 100,000 jin, equivalent to 143% of the total grain purchase in the entire township in 1955. This summer, Zhangjiakou Special District will utilize mountain floods to silt 1.5 million mu, an increase of 450,000 mu compared to last year. These silted fields are expected to increase grain production by more than 11.2 million jin this year.

    永定河上游加强水土保持工作
    本报讯　河北省张家口专区加强永定河上游的山区水土保持工作。半年来，全专区十六个县已经修建了150多万亩面积的水土保持工程。这些工程有效地减少了永定河上游的水土冲刷，对于保护官厅水库和山区农业生产，正在发生良好的作用。
    在进行水土保持工作过程中，农民们一面进行封山育林、开渠、修筑土堤、石坝和小型水库，一面在这些地方种植作物。如怀安县常家沟今年仅在鱼鳞坑内点种的豆子估计就可收十万多斤，相当于全乡1955年粮食征购总数的143％。今年夏季，张家口专区将利用山洪放淤150万亩，比去年增加45万亩，这些淤田今年可增产粮食1，120多万斤。
