    Spring Soybean Harvest in Overseas Chinese Hometowns Along the Fujian Coast

    (Our report) The spring soybean crop in the overseas Chinese hometowns of Jinjiang and Longxi Special Districts and the suburbs of Xiamen City in Fujian province is being harvested, and the farmers of these hometowns are joyfully reporting their bumper harvest to their relatives abroad. Spring soybean is one of the main grain crops in the summer harvest of the overseas Chinese hometowns. This year's planting area is approximately 500,000 mu, accounting for about 80% of the province's spring soybean planting area.

    The area has now entered the busy harvest season. Relatives of overseas Chinese and farmers are beaming with joy as they harvest soybeans with thick stalks, many pods, and full grains. They are passing on the good news of another bumper harvest after collectivization to their relatives abroad.

    In order to guarantee increased production and income for the relatives of overseas Chinese and farmers, the grain departments in the overseas Chinese hometowns along the southern Fujian coast have established more than 100 purchasing stations or purchasing points. Many people in the overseas Chinese hometowns have already sold their surplus soybeans to the state.

    福建沿海侨乡春大豆丰收
    本报讯　福建沿海侨乡晋江、龙溪专区和厦门市郊的春大豆开始登场，侨乡农民向国外亲人喜报丰收。春大豆是侨乡人民夏收粮食中的主要粮种之一。今年种植面积约五十多万亩，占全省春大豆播种面积80％左右。
    这里目前已进入收获大忙季节。侨眷和农民在收割秆粗、多荚、颗粒饱满的大豆的时候，喜气洋洋，他们纷纷把合作化后的又一次丰收的喜讯，传给国外的亲人。
    侨乡粮食部门为了保证侨眷和农民增产增收，已在闽南沿海侨乡设立一百多个收购站或收购点。不少侨乡人民已把自己用不完的大豆卖给国家。
