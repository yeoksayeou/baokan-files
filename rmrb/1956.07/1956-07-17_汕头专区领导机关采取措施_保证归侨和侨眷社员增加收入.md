Xinhua News Agency, Shantou, July 15th. The leading organs of the Shantou Special District of Guangdong Province have decided to ensure that 90% of returned overseas Chinese and family members of overseas Chinese participating in agricultural cooperatives will have higher incomes than last year. This decision was made at a conference of overseas Chinese affairs cadres in the entire special district.

The specific measures adopted by the Shantou Special District to guarantee increased income for 90% of overseas Chinese households are as follows: First, all counties will conduct a "three checks" (check resources, check technology, check income) on sideline occupations in overseas Chinese areas, and rapidly expand sideline production to increase income. Second, if returned overseas Chinese and family members of overseas Chinese have labor force members working elsewhere, and no one at home is participating in labor, the cooperative will be required to pay 15% of the land remuneration. Third, returned overseas Chinese and family members of overseas Chinese who cannot participate in major labor should be assigned appropriate labor according to their actual abilities, so that they can obtain certain remuneration. Fourth, overseas Chinese households that still have difficulties in life after adopting the above methods will be subsidized by the public welfare fund of the agricultural cooperative.

The Shantou Special District Party and government leading organs have also decided to relax the quantity of grain supply, that is, regardless of whether in urban or rural areas, the monthly grain ration quota for returned overseas Chinese and family members of overseas Chinese will be increased from 24 catties to 26 to 30 catties. In addition, it has also been decided that for special needs such as weddings, funerals, and celebrations of returned overseas Chinese and family members of overseas Chinese, all departments should do their best to meet the supply.

    汕头专区领导机关采取措施
    保证归侨和侨眷社员增加收入
    新华社汕头15日电　广东汕头专区领导机关决定保证90％参加农业社的归侨和侨眷社员比去年增加收入。这一决定是在全专区侨务干部会议上作出的。
    汕头专区保证90％的侨户社员增加收入采取的具体措施是：一、各县在侨区进行副业三查（查资源、查技术、查收入），迅速展开副业生产以增加收入。二、归侨、侨眷社员如劳动力外出，家中无人参加劳动时，决定由合作社偿付15％的土地报酬。三、对不能参加主要劳动的归侨和侨眷社员，要按照他们的实际能力安排他们适当的劳动，使他们可以获得一定的报酬。四、采用上述办法后生活还有困难的侨户，由农业社的公益金补助。
    汕头专区党政领导机关还决定：放宽粮食供应的数量，即不论在城市或农村，归侨和侨眷，每月口粮供应指标从二十四斤增加到二十六至三十斤。此外还决定凡归侨、侨眷婚丧喜庆等特殊需要，各部门要尽最大可能来满足供应。
