Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, 16th - From the 13th to the 15th, most areas of Hunan Province experienced widespread rainfall. According to statistics from the Hunan Provincial Water Conservancy Department, rainfall in most areas ranged from 20 to 30 millimeters, with some areas reaching 50 millimeters.

Since mid-June, Hunan Province had not received rain for over a month. More than five million mu of paddy fields with relatively poor water conservancy conditions throughout the province were threatened by varying degrees of drought. This rainfall has greatly reduced the threat of drought. In areas that were previously severely drought-stricken, such as Yiyang, Pingjiang, Shimen, and Sangzhi counties, the rice fields affected by drought now have more than an inch of water. After the rainfall, agricultural production cooperatives in various localities launched water storage and conservation activities and blocked leaky ponds.

    湖南普降喜雨
    旱灾威胁大大减轻
    新华社长沙16日电　13日到15日，湖南省绝大部分地区普降喜雨。据湖南省水利厅统计，大部分地区降雨量二十到三十公厘，有些地区达五十公厘。
    湖南省自六月中旬以来，有一个多月没有下雨。全省五百多万亩水利条件较差的稻田遭受不同程度的干旱威胁。这次降雨后，旱灾威胁大大减轻。益阳、平江、石门、桑植等县原来干旱比较严重的地区，现在降雨后受旱稻田里已有一寸多深水。各地农业生产合作社在降雨后都展开了蓄水、保水活动，并堵塞漏水的池塘。
