    Production and Construction Corps Helps Farmers
    Plan a New Type of Farm

    The Production and Construction Corps in the Anjihai Reclamation Area is helping nearby farmers plan a new type of farm, which will have more than 70,000 mu of cultivated land.

    Farmers of four ethnic groups, Uygur, Kazakh, Hui, and Han, live in the Anjihai Reclamation Area. Their residences are very scattered, making business management extremely inconvenient after the establishment of agricultural cooperatives. At the same time, the Production and Construction Corps wants to comprehensively plan this reclamation area, and the farmers' small plots of cultivated land, scattered within the reclamation area, also affect the planning of the farm. After several consultations, the farmers voluntarily agreed to move to a new location.

    During this period, the farm's commanders personally selected the most fertile land for the farmers, and the water conservancy and wasteland surveying teams also comprehensively planned the farm. Currently, the soldiers are building irrigation canals and reclaiming wasteland for the farm. In the future, they will also build the farm's office and the farmers' residences. These residences will be better than the ones the farmers originally lived in. This fully demonstrates the good relationship between the army and the people.

    生产建设部队帮助农民
    规划一座新型农场
    安集海垦区的生产建设部队，正在给附近的农民规划一座新型的农场，这座农场将拥有耕地七万多亩。
    安集海垦区内，住有维吾尔、哈萨克、回、汉四个民族的农民，他们住的地方很分散，农业合作社成立后，经营管理极不方便。同时，生产建设部队要全面规划这个垦区，农民们小块的耕地，分散在垦区内，也影响到农场的规划。经过多次协商，农民们自愿集中迁移到新的地方。
    在这期间，农场的指挥员们亲自给农民选择了最肥沃的土地，水利和荒地勘测队也全面规划了这座农场。目前，战士们正在给农场兴修水渠，开垦荒地，将来他们还要修建农场的办公室和农民的住宅。这些住宅比农民原先住的要好。从这里，充分表现出军民之间良好的关系。
