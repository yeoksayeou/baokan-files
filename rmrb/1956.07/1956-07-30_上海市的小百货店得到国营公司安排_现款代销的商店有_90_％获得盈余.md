    Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, July 27th. The business situation of 405 small general merchandise stores in Shanghai, which operate miscellaneous goods, has generally improved since they were arranged by state-owned companies and implemented cash consignment sales over the past month. Currently, 90% of the stores have achieved a surplus, and the past difficulties in the lives of small business owners have been changed.

    These small stores are scattered throughout the small streets and alleys of Shanghai, most of them being "husband-and-wife stores" where the home and business are not separate. They operate a wide variety of goods and have close ties with the nearby residents. After the high tide of socialist transformation of private industry and commerce this year, although state-owned companies continued to make some arrangements for them, their long-standing difficulties were not completely resolved, and more than 160 households were still losing money. Starting in June, state-owned department stores entrusted them with cash consignment sales, allocating 420,000 yuan as commodity loans to help them overcome the difficulty of insufficient funds. This loan is more than twice the self-owned funds of all the small stores. In addition, they were helped to form 37 cooperative groups, distributed according to location and responsible for their own profits and losses, to implement mutual assistance in business operations, labor, and life.

    The thirty-one state-owned general merchandise wholesale departments distributed in various places have provided them with many conveniences in terms of supply of goods. The department stores issue each store a purchase voucher, which they can use to select goods from any wholesale department at any time, without having to prepare a purchase plan in advance. The department stores give them priority in supplying fast-selling goods, simplified their purchasing procedures, and also contacted state-owned silk companies and textile companies on their behalf to assist them in purchasing silk thread, shoe upper binding, sunflower fans, straw mats, DDT, prickly heat powder, and other commodities that the department stores do not operate. The wholesale departments pay the consignment fee and deduct the business tax when the small business owners purchase goods, so that the small stores can receive a certain income in advance and reduce the trouble of paying taxes.

    After implementing cash consignment sales, these small stores have maintained their original operating characteristics, and the operating enthusiasm of small business owners has also increased. The Taili General Merchandise Store in Changning District originally had only 300 yuan of funds and sold only about 100 kinds of goods. After obtaining the commodity loan, it added more than 200 new commodities. Small business owner Gao Xiangyun used to go to the department store wholesale department to purchase goods once every two or three days. Now, he goes to see it whenever he is free, sometimes purchasing goods two or three times a day. The turnover in June and July increased by more than 60% compared to May before the consignment sales. Bao Qirong, the small business owner of Ruifeng General Merchandise Store in Yulin District, and his wife and son take turns working, and the business hours are from 6:00 in the morning to 10:00 in the evening, which is convenient for the families of nearby workers to buy things. The consignment fee income obtained in June, after deducting the expenses of a family of ten, still had a surplus of about 50 yuan.

### 上海市的小百货店得到国营公司安排  现款代销的商店有90％获得盈余

    上海市的小百货店得到国营公司安排
    现款代销的商店有90％获得盈余
    新华社上海27日电　上海市四百零五家经营零星百货的小商店，最近一个多月得到国营公司安排和实行现款代销以来，营业情况普遍好转。现在，90％的店子都获得了盈余，小业主过去生活困难的情况已经得到改变。
    这些小商店散布在上海的小街小巷，大部分是家店不分的“夫妻商店”，经营的商品多种多样，和附近居民联系很密切。今年私营工商业社会主义改造高潮以后，国营公司虽然继续对他们作了一些安排，但他们长期存在的困难没有完全解决，还有一百六十多户亏损。从六月份起，国营百货公司委托他们现款代销，前后拨出四十二万元作为商品贷款，帮助他们克服资金短少的困难，这笔贷款相当于所有小商店自有资金的二倍多；另外还帮助他们按地段组成三十七个分散经营、各负盈亏的合作社小组，在业务经营、劳动力和生活等方面实行互助。
    分布在各处的三十一个国营百货商品批发部，在货源供应上给予他们许多方便。百货公司发给每店一张购货凭证，他们可以随时到任何一个批发部去选购商品，不用再事先编造进货计划。百货公司优先供应他们热销货，简化了他们进货的手续，还代他们同国营丝绸公司和纺织品公司等部门联系，协助他们采购了丝线、鞋面滚条、葵扇、草席、滴滴涕、痱子粉等百货公司不经营的商品。各批发部在小业主进货的时候就付给代销手续费，代扣营业税，使小商店提前得到一定的收入，减少了缴税的麻烦。
    这些小商店实行现款代销以后，保持了原有的经营特色，小业主的经营积极性也提高了。长宁区泰利百货商店原来只有三百元资金，出售的商品不过一百种左右，获得了商品贷款以后，就添置了二百多种新商品。小业主高祥云以前两三天才到百货公司批发部进一次货，现在有空就跑去看看，有时一天进两、三次货，六、七月份的营业额都比代销以前的五月份上升60％以上。榆林区瑞丰百货店小业主包启荣和他的妻子、儿子交替上班，营业时间从清晨六时一直到晚上十时，便利附近工人家属买东西，六月份来获得的代销手续费收入，除去一家十口开支，还有五十元左右盈余。
