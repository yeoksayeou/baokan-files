    Grasping “Thousand-Jin Fields” While Also Grasping the “Wanbao Mountains”

    Grasping "thousand-jin fields" must also entail grasping "Wanbao Mountains"—this is the experience and lesson the Sha County Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has drawn in leading mountain area production.

    Sha County is one of the rich counties in the northern mountainous area of ​​Fujian Province. There are more than 230 agricultural, forestry, animal husbandry, and local specialty production projects in more than 90 townships across the county. People call the mountainous areas here the "Wanbao Mountains" (Mountains of Treasures). Local farmers have rich experience in managing diverse economies.

    In recent years, due to the one-sided emphasis on grain production by local leading cadres, the production of diverse economies, which accounts for more than half of the county's total income, has been ignored. As a result, only timber, oil tea, and live pig production in this county have caught up with the highest levels before the War of Resistance Against Japan. The production of other major local specialties such as shiitake mushrooms, dried bamboo shoots, and tea has not been restored and developed as it should be. Before the spring plowing this year, 95% of the farmers in the county joined advanced cooperatives. The county's leading organs still only emphasized grain production and failed to promptly study and handle the policy issues of forest land, bamboo mountains, and tea gardens joining the cooperatives, resulting in large areas of bamboo mountains and tea gardens being abandoned. Because the agricultural cooperatives "controlled" labor too rigidly, the collection of highly valuable wild plants such as medicinal materials and persimmon peels was also greatly reduced. In this way, although grain production increased, the actual income of the cooperative members did not increase, and it also caused tension in market supply.

    Not long ago, the Sha County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party summarized this serious lesson, criticized the one-sidedness of the leading ideology, and quickly mobilized Party organizations at all levels to designate special personnel to be responsible for a comprehensive and in-depth inspection of issues related to mountain forest joining cooperatives, taxes and prices of local specialties, and grain production targets. It also helped agricultural cooperatives properly solve problems such as labor arrangement and the method of calculating and paying remuneration to cooperative members for managing local specialty production. At the same time, the county party committee sent a large number of cadres to the mountains to visit experienced old farmers who managed local mountain specialties and learn from them the experience of developing the production of mountain specialties.

    Now, the Sha County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has revised the production plan for developing diverse mountain economies, clearly stipulating that all districts and townships where local specialty production is the main source of income should take the development of local specialty production as the central task. The county party committee has also determined key production areas for shiitake mushrooms, tea, dried bamboo shoots, native paper, fruit trees, tung oil, oil tea, and timber forests based on the different natural conditions of the county’s more than 90 townships, helping agricultural cooperatives to establish fixed specialized production team organizations, formulate short-term production plans for different production seasons, and mobilize farmers to widely exchange their production experiences. The county's economic departments have also strengthened the procurement of local specialties and promptly issued loans to support agricultural cooperatives in developing diverse production.

    抓千斤田也要抓万宝山
    新华社记者　郑汀
    抓“千斤田”，也要抓“万宝山”——中共沙县县委在领导山区生产工作中得出了这样的经验教训。
    沙县是福建省北部山区富饶的县份之一。全县九十多个乡的农、林、畜牧业和土特产等生产项目计有二百三十多种。人们把这里的山区称为“万宝山”。当地农民有经营多种经济的丰富经验。
    这几年来，由于当地领导干部片面强调了粮食生产，把占全县总收入一半以上的多种经济的生产忽略了。因而，这个县现在只有木材、油茶、生猪等生产赶上了抗日战争前的最高水平，其他如香菇、笋干、茶叶等大宗土特产品的生产，未得到应有的恢复和发展。今年春耕前，全县95％的农户加入了高级社，县的领导机关仍然只强调粮食生产，对林地、竹山、茶园的入社政策问题又未及时进行研究和处理，以致大片竹山、茶园荒芜了。由于农业社对劳动力“统”的太死，药材、山柿皮等价值很高的野生植物的采集也大大减少了。这样，虽然粮食有了增产，但社员的实际收入没有增加，还造成市场供应的紧张。
    不久以前，中共沙县委员会总结了这个严重教训，批判了领导思想的片面性，迅速动员各级党组织指定专人负责全面深入地检查了有关山林入社、土特产品的税收、价格和粮食生产指标等问题，并帮助农业社妥善解决了劳力安排和社员经营土特产品生产的计工报酬办法等问题。同时，县委派出大批干部上山拜访经营山区土特产有经验的老农，向他们学习发展山区土特产品生产的经验。
    现在，中共沙县县委已修订了发展山区多种经济的生产规划，明确规定凡是土特产生产为主要收入来源的区乡，都应以发展土特产生产为中心任务。县委又根据全县九十多个乡不同的自然条件，分别确定了香菇、茶叶、笋干、土纸、果树、油桐油茶和用材林等重点产区，帮助农业社建立固定的专业生产队组织，订出各个不同生产季节的短期生产计划，并发动农民广泛交流他们之间的生产经验。县的经济部门也加强了对土特产品的收购，并及时发放了贷款，扶持农业社发展多种生产。
