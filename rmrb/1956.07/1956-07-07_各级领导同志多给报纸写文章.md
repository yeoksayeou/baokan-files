    Leaders at All Levels Should Write More Articles for Newspapers

    In recent years, leading comrades of Party and government organs at all levels have written many articles for newspapers, which have been very instructive for various tasks. However, some leading comrades do not pay enough attention to this aspect, especially leaders above the county and district committees write fewer articles for newspapers. In order to run newspapers better, I believe that the secretaries of Party committees at all levels and the responsible persons of governments at all levels should write more articles for newspapers; newspaper editorial departments should also do more to organize稿件 (gaojian - manuscripts/contributions).

    各级领导同志多给报纸写文章
    几年来，各级党政机关的负责同志给报纸写了不少文章，对各项工作很有指导作用。但是，有些领导同志对这方面还重视不够，特别是县委地委以上的领导同志给报纸写文章更少。为了把报纸办得更好，我认为各级党委书记、政府的各级负责人，应该多给报纸写文章；报纸编辑部也应该多做一些组织稿件的工作。　（夏好礼）
