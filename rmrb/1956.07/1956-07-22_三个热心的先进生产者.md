Three Enthusiastic Advanced Producers

　　By our reporter Xiao Yan

Liu Guangyi from the heat treatment workshop of the Yantai Bearing Factory, Xu Xiaohai from the heat treatment workshop of the Yantai Machine Tool Accessories Factory, and Xiang Tongli from the heat treatment workshop of the Yantai Machine Manufacturing Factory all attended the Shandong Provincial Advanced Producers Representative Conference. Although the three of them lived in Yantai City and were in the same industry, they didn't know each other before. Since they took the train to Jinan together and were assigned to the same group and lived in the same dormitory during the provincial advanced producers representative conference, they became very good friends.

At the conference, the Yantai Clock Factory was severely criticized for neglecting product quality. These three advanced producers were very moved when they heard these criticisms. When they further learned that the clock factory's product quality was affected precisely because of problems with the heat treatment of the pendulum tips, they could hardly contain their enthusiasm to jointly assist the brother factory in solving the problem. From then on, studying the quenching problem of alarm clock pendulum tips became the central topic of their conversations. They exchanged experiences with the representatives of the clock factory attending the meeting and initially came up with a way to help the clock factory improve quenching. After the meeting, Liu Guangyi and Xu Xiaohai went to Beijing. Xiang Tongli, who returned first, went to the clock factory to help first. He carefully observed the raw materials, tools, and methods used to make the pendulum tips and took back some previously made pendulum tips to study and test their hardness.

A few days later, Xu Xiaohai returned from Beijing. On a holiday, the two of them were invited to the clock factory at the same time. Based on their analysis of the steel material currently used, they suggested using salt water quenching to increase the hardness of the pendulum tips from 40 degrees to 60 degrees. Xiang Tongli also brought an optical pyrometer to help the clock factory test how to control the quenching temperature. They also suggested using high-carbon steel raw materials and improving the quenching fixture. These two enthusiastic people stayed at the clock factory for a whole day, assisting in quenching more than three thousand pendulum tips. Later, Liu Guangyi returned from Beijing and also ran to the clock factory to provide specific assistance.

The poor quality of the pendulum tips was the key factor affecting the short lifespan of alarm clocks, and this problem has now been solved. The employees of the clock factory are very grateful to these three enthusiastic advanced producers. They said: This is all the power of the advanced producer movement led by the Party.

    三个热心的先进生产者
    本报记者　萧彦
    烟台轴承厂热处理车间的刘广义，烟台机床附件厂热处理车间的徐肖海和烟台机器制造厂热处理车间的相同礼一起出席了山东省先进生产者代表会议。三个人虽然都住在烟台市，而且是同行，但是过去彼此都不相识。自从他们一块坐火车到了济南，在全省先进生产者代表会议期间又编为一个小组、住在一个宿舍以后，就成了非常要好的朋友。
    在会上，烟台造钟厂因为忽视产品质量受到了严正的批评。这三个先进生产者听见这些批评，心里都非常激动。他们进一步了解到钟厂恰恰是因为造摆尖的热处理有问题影响产品质量的时候，简直抑制不住要合力协助兄弟厂解决难题的热情了。从这以后，研究闹钟摆尖淬火问题成了他们交谈心事的中心课题。他们和造钟厂列席会议的代表在一块交流了经验，初步想出帮助造钟厂改进淬火的办法。会后，刘广义和徐肖海到北京去了。先回来的相同礼便先到钟厂去帮忙。他仔细地观察了造摆尖的原料、工具和方法，拿回了一些过去做的摆尖，研究试验它的硬度。
    过了几天，徐肖海从北京回来了。在一个休假日，他们两人同时被请到造钟厂。他们根据对现在使用的钢料的分析，建议改用盐水淬火，使摆尖硬度由四十度提高到了六十度。相同礼还带去了光学高温计，帮助钟厂试验如何掌握淬火的温度。他们还建议改用高炭钢原料和改进淬火夹具。这两个热心人在钟厂坚持了一整天，协助试淬了三千多个摆尖子。后来刘广义从北京回来，也跑到钟厂具体协助。
    摆尖的质量不好，是影响闹钟寿命不长的关键，这个难题现在解决了。钟厂的职工非常感激这三位热心的先进生产者。他们说：这都是党领导开展先进生产者运动的力量。
