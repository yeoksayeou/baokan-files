While Being Responsible to Party Members, Cadres Must Also Be Supervised

The Changjiang Daily (Wuhan) on July 4th exposed the fact that leading cadres in the Wuhan Post Office were engaged in unprincipled disputes, causing disunity within the Party. In an editorial published on the same day, the Changjiang Daily pointed out that this situation is not an isolated phenomenon in grassroots Party organizations in Wuhan, especially in factories and enterprises.

The editorial pointed out that the main reason is that these grassroots Party organizations cannot regularly carry out ideological struggle and eliminate errors when they are just budding. Many grassroots Party organizations only supervise ordinary Party members, and only collect Party dues and issue documents to cadres responsible for Party members. They never ask about their thoughts, studies, or work. There are also a few cadres responsible for Party members who regard themselves as special figures within the Party, using the excuse of being busy with work to avoid participating in organizational life, let alone reporting their work and thoughts to the branch and listening to criticism from Party members.

The editorial pointed out that it is necessary to strengthen the Party organization's supervision of all Party members, improve democratic life within the Party, and regularly carry out ideological struggles in order to eliminate these unhealthy phenomena in Party life.

    地方报纸评论摘要
    对党员负责干部也要监督
    七月四日，长江日报（武汉）揭露了武汉邮局领导干部之间闹无原则纠纷，造成党内不团结的事实。长江日报在同日发表的社论中，指出这种情况在武汉市基层党组织特别是工厂企业基层党组织中还不是个别的现象。
    社论指出，主要原因在于这些基层党组织不能经常地开展思想斗争，在错误萌芽的时候就把它消灭。不少基层党组织只监督一般党员，对党员负责干部就只是向他们收党费、发文件，对于他们的思想、学习、工作情况从来不去过问。也有少数党员负责干部在党内以特殊人物自居，借口工作忙不参加组织生活，更谈不上向支部汇报自己的工作和思想情况，听取党员的批评。
    社论指出，必须加强党组织对全体党员的监督，健全党内民主生活，经常地开展思想斗争，才能消除党内生活中的这种不良现象。
