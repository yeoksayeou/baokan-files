	Shenyang, this newspaper, 20th - The Shenyang Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China recently arranged industrial work for the third quarter, deciding to broadly launch a competition for producing excellent products to ensure a more significant improvement in product quality.
	In the first half of the year, the situation regarding the completion of national plans by state-owned and local state-owned factories in Shenyang was relatively good. Thirty-three of the sixty-three state-owned factories reached the production level of the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule, and fifty-three exceeded the plan for the first half of the year; the total output value increased by 55.8% compared with the same period last year; labor productivity increased by 42.9% compared with the same period last year; and the total cost was also reduced by more than 2% compared with the plan. Since the Municipal Party Committee strengthened its leadership in improving product quality in the second quarter, launched a competition for producing excellent products in more than one hundred factories throughout the city, and exchanged the experiences of grassroots organizations in improving product quality, product quality has also improved significantly.
	However, poor product quality remains a serious problem in Shenyang's current production. The quality of many products is very unstable and not good, and the defect rate and rework rate of intermediate products are still high. Therefore, the Municipal Party Committee has determined that in the third quarter, the competition for producing excellent products must truly become a broad mass movement. The industrial departments of the Municipal Party Committee must continue to summarize and exchange experiences in improving product quality and in carrying out the competition for producing excellent products; they must inspect units with serious fluctuations in product quality and help them improve their work. In the competition, it is essential to proceed from the specific circumstances of each factory; some should focus on technical transformation, some should focus on rectifying technology, and some should improve technology and learn from advanced experience.
	In addition to emphasizing the improvement of product quality, the Municipal Party Committee has also decided to pay attention to overcoming formalism in the advanced producer movement and eliminating the phenomenon of hundreds or thousands of advanced producers who still cannot complete their production tasks. At present, the standards and reward methods for advanced producers are very chaotic, and the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions is responsible for formulating a unified standard within the third quarter. The Municipal Party Committee also decided that in terms of the lives of employees, it is necessary to ensure that wage reform is carried out well; actively solve the housing problems of employees; quickly adjust the prices of tap water, gas, trams, and automobiles in public utilities; appropriately reduce hospital drug prices and change the employee hospitalization deposit method; and also decided to withdraw a batch of money from the labor insurance fund and enterprise bonus fund to help employees who are unable to repay their debts clear their debts.

### 沈阳市委安排第三季度工业工作  决定广泛开展生产优良产品竞赛

    沈阳市委安排第三季度工业工作
    决定广泛开展生产优良产品竞赛
    本报沈阳20日电　中共沈阳市委最近安排了第三季度工业方面的工作，决定广泛开展生产优良产品的竞赛，保证产品质量有更加显著的提高。
    上半年，沈阳市国营和地方国营工厂完成国家计划情况是比较好的。六十三个国营工厂有三十三个提前达到五年计划的生产水平，五十三个超额完成了上半年计划；总产值比去年同期提高了55.8％；劳动生产率比去年同期提高了42.9％；总成本也比计划降低了2％强。自从第二季度市委加强了对改进产品质量工作的领导，在全市一百多个工厂中开展了生产优良产品的竞赛，交流了基层组织改进产品质量的经验以后，产品质量也有了显著的提高。
    但是，产品质量低劣，仍然是沈阳市当前生产中的一个严重问题。许多产品质量很不稳很不好，中间产品废品率和返修率还很高。因此，市委确定第三季度内要使生产优良产品的竞赛真正成为一个广泛的群众性运动。市委各工业部要继续总结和交流改善产品质量的经验和开展生产优良产品竞赛的经验；对产品质量波动严重的单位，要进行检查，帮助他们改进工作。在竞赛中，一定要从各厂的具体情况出发，有的应该着重进行技术改造，有的要着重整顿工艺，有的要提高技术和学习先进经验。
    除了强调改进产品质量外，市委还决定要注意克服先进生产者运动中的形式主义，消除先进生产者上百上千、但是生产任务仍然完不成的现象。目前先进生产者的标准和奖励办法都很混乱，市委责成市工会要在第三季度内订出一个统一的标准来。市委还决定，在职工生活方面，要保证搞好工资改革；积极解决职工的住宅问题；迅速调整公用事业中自来水、煤气、电车和汽车的价格；适当降低医院药价和改变职工住院押金办法；还决定从劳保基金和企业奖励基金中抽出一批钱，帮助无力归还债款的职工还清债务。
