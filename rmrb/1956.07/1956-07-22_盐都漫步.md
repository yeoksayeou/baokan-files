A Stroll Through the Salt Capital
By Our Correspondent Ji Xichen

About 45 kilometers southwest of Neijiang lies Zigong, the salt capital of our motherland.

The salt produced annually in Zigong is sold to Sichuan, Yunnan, Guizhou, and the southern parts of Shaanxi, and the western parts of Hubei and Hunan, providing salt for 50 to 60 million people. But how is well salt produced here? How do the salt workers extract brine from over a thousand meters underground and boil it into salt using natural gas? To understand these questions, Xiao Shaocheng, vice director of the Xinhua Second Salt Factory, who has been a salt worker here for 18 years, accompanied me on a visit to their salt factory.

Before even reaching the salt factory, we could hear the rapidly spinning winch, the “sky wheel,” rumbling above the ancient and majestic salt well derrick. I originally thought these salt well derricks, tens of meters high, were made of reinforced concrete. However, upon closer inspection, I discovered that these brine-extracting derricks were all made of fir wood bound with bamboo strips and ropes. Regarding this astonishing construction, Comrade Xiao Shaocheng smiled and said to me:

"You think it's simple? But don't underestimate it! This fir wood frame is more durable than steel when used in salt wells. Steel is easily corroded and damaged by salt brine, while these bamboo-and-fir-wood-built derricks become even more nourished and stronger when exposed to brine, and won't break down for 20 or 30 years. This simple and ingenious method began to be used as far back as 2,000 years ago!"

We stopped at the brine rock well under the derrick. Although the wellhead of this brine well is only the size of a small porcelain jar, it is over a thousand meters deep. To extract the salt from the salt rock beneath the earth, our wise ancestors first dug salt wells, and then poured clean water down the well from the surface. When the clean water dissolved the salt rock into brine, they used long steel ropes tied to iron pipes to lower into the well and extract the clean brine. It is said that every pound of brine contains seven to nine ounces of salt. In the past, brine extraction was done by people pushing and oxen pulling, but now it has been replaced by electricity and steam engines.

On a hillside, we also visited the black brine wells and yellow brine wells, with wellheads only the size of medium and small bowls. The brine from the black brine wells resembled the ink in an inkstone, while the brine from the yellow brine wells was waxy yellow. Although the salt yield of these wells is not as high as that of the brine rock wells, the brine contains abundant chemical raw materials and can be extracted without artificial watering, serving as a natural brine source for salt making. In the past, one salt well could only extract more than 20,000 dan of brine, but now it can extract 130,000 to 140,000 dan.

The crisscrossing brine pipelines are one of the most striking sights in the salt fields. These giant python-like brine pipelines, all made of nan bamboo, carry brine freshly extracted from the salt wells, across fields and hills, over clear rivers, and through the city's airspace, transporting the brine to boiling workshops more than ten kilometers away, where it is boiled into salt using natural gas or coal. If all the pipelines in the city were connected, their length would reach 127 kilometers. Regarding this, Comrade Xiao Shaocheng said with a proud expression: "When our ancestors began to use this inexpensive and practical 'salt field water pipe' to transport brine, the principle of running water had not yet been discovered in the world!"

The most interesting thing in the salt factory is the fire well used for boiling salt. In that deep and narrow wellhead, blue-green flames of gas (natural gas) spurt upwards day and night. Small fire wells can burn two or three salt pans, while large ones can burn two or three hundred.

Who began to dig such deep salt wells, and when? When did people discover that underground gas could be used to boil salt? According to comrades from the Zigong Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, well digging began here as early as the Qin Dynasty, two thousand years ago. By the Tang Dynasty, the natural gas reserves in Zigong were discovered, and the scale of excavation expanded. During the Song Dynasty (960-1279 AD), China's working people further massively excavated gas fire wells. This was several centuries earlier than when Britain began using gas to light lamps in 1886.

In the dark years under Kuomintang rule, the prosperous salt capital suffered from shrinking production, the closure of wells and stoves, and the extremely painful lives of the people. From 1937 to 1947, the price of salt rose twenty-seven times. Even the salt workers had the saying that "a dou of rice buys a jin of salt". Salt workers waged heroic struggles to resist harsh exploitation and oppression. In 1926 alone, under the leadership of the underground organization of the Chinese Communist Party, salt workers in the city carried out more than ten strikes.

The salt workers of Zigong, with their glorious revolutionary tradition, have been fully engaged in the struggle to restore and develop salt production since the day of liberation on December 5, 1949. Dilapidated and desolate salt fields were repaired, collapsed derricks were erected, the stoves for boiling salt were burning again, and salt production rapidly increased. Last year, salt workers completed the annual plan ahead of schedule with selfless labor, producing 8.01 million dan of salt, exceeding the highest annual output in history by more than 60%. Now, the city's salt workers are striving to over fulfill the task of producing 8.5 million dan of salt in 1956.

The salt fields are filled with a vibrant construction scene. Many fields that were desolate not long ago have now become lively construction sites, with towering drilling rig derricks. The newly established state-owned Salt Affairs Bureau's First and Second Workshops have transformed Zigong's salt industry, which had been fragmented and backward for thousands of years, from simple manual operations to semi-mechanized and mechanized production. Xu Daxing, a special-class labor model, created the "cylinder brine extractor," and other salt workers created the "automatic brine measuring device" and "automatic oil cup," which greatly improved the working conditions of the workers, increased labor productivity, reduced waste products, and lowered costs. In order to extract more than ten valuable chemical raw materials such as potassium, iodine, bromine, and borax contained in the salt brine, Zigong City has built a modern chemical plant. More chemical plants will soon appear in the salt capital.

During the high tide of socialist transformation this year, all large and small salt fields in Zigong City implemented joint public-private ownership. Regarding this earth-shaking change, Comrade Mou Haixiu of the Zigong Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party once said to me:

"According to the management principles of socialist enterprises, we have organized more than 100 small wells and stoves within a 30-li range into two large companies, Jianhua and Jiuda. In these two companies, on a regional basis, seven or eight small wells and stoves are jointly formed into seventeen large workshops. Due to the establishment and improvement of enterprise management institutions, the production of well salt has changed from the past decentralized and backward handicraft production method to large-scale production. In these two enterprises, we have implemented various management systems and carried out large-scale repairs and renovations of some outdated production equipment. After Jianhua Company's joint public-private ownership, the production scale has doubled; Jiuda Company's total assets have increased more than fourfold."

In recent years, more than 20,000 square meters of new employee dormitories have been built. In the past, workers slept on bamboo boards in the summer and were confined to bamboo sleeping mats in the winter. Now they have all happily moved into new homes. In the past, workers worked in low, hot, and stuffy stove rooms. When it was hot in the summer, some workers would faint. Now, the factory buildings are not only equipped with better ventilation equipment, but the Second Salt Plant of Jiuda Company is also equipped with roof sprinklers, and chimneys have been set up in the gas stove rooms to remove sulfur dioxide gas. Due to improved working conditions and medical equipment, the employee injury rate has been reduced by more than 60% in recent years.

Workers' cultural life is also becoming increasingly active. More than 7,000 employees throughout the city are studying in amateur cultural schools. Many old workers who didn't know a single character in the past can now read newspapers. The newly built workers' cultural palace in the city center and the clubs in various industrial districts are often visited by a constant stream of workers to play ball, play chess, and play cards. The city has also newly built two cinemas, two Sichuan opera theaters, and a storytelling venue for employees. The newly built skating rink and illuminated ball field in the park are all places for workers to relax and enjoy themselves.

There are now more than 20 primary and secondary schools in the city, and two newly built normal schools and salt industry technical schools. Along the banks of the Fuxi River in the city, many new houses have been built. Buses run along the flat roads all day long. The newly installed tap water brings great convenience to the citizens living in the mountains. The Binjiang Road area, known as Zigong City's "Dragon Beard Ditch," has been built with neat stone embankments, and floods will no longer climb up the embankments. The large iron bridge spanning the river is also under construction. It is foreseeable that after the Neikun Railway opens to traffic, our salt capital will become even more prosperous!

    盐都漫步
    本报记者　纪希晨
    从内江往西南行走四十五公里，便到了祖国的盐都——自贡。
    自贡每年生产的食盐，运销四川、云南、贵州和陕西南部、湖北、湖南西部，可供五、六千万人民食用。可是这里的井盐是怎么生产的？盐工们是怎样在一千多公尺深的地下汲出卤水，把它用天然气煎煮成盐的？为着了解这些问题，在这里当了十八年盐工的新华第二制盐厂萧绍成副厂长，陪同我对他们的盐厂进行了访问。
    没到盐厂以前，老远就听到飞速转动着的绞车“天车轮”，在古老雄伟的盐井架上隆隆作响。我原以为这些十多二十丈高的盐井架，都是钢筋水泥制成的，可是，仔细一看，却发现这些汲卤井架，全是由竹篾绳索捆着的杉木组成的。对于这种令人惊奇的建筑，萧绍成同志笑着对我说：
    “你看它简单吗？可是，你可别小看它哩！这种杉木架用在盐井上，比钢铁还要经久耐用呢。钢铁容易被盐卤水腐蚀损坏，而这些竹皮杉木建成的井架，沾上卤水以后，反而更加滋润、结实，用上二、三十年也不会坏。这个简单巧妙的办法，远在两千年前，就开始使用了！”
    我们在井架下面的卤岩井跟前停了下来。这个卤井的井口虽然只有小磁罐子口那么大小，却有一千多公尺深。为了取出地层下盐岩的盐分，我们聪明的祖先先凿了盐井，然后再把清水从地面上顺井灌注到地下去。等到清水把盐岩溶解成卤水的时候，再用长长的钢绳，系着冰铁管，放下去，把清洁的卤水汲出来。据说，每斤卤水含盐七至九两。从前汲卤都是用人推、牛拉，现在却改成电力和蒸气机了。
    在一处山坡上，我们还参观了井口只有中小碗口那么大的黑卤井和黄卤井。黑卤井的卤水像砚池里的墨水，黄卤井里的卤水则是蜡黄色的。这种井的产盐量虽然没有卤岩井那么高，卤水中却含有丰富的化工原料，并且不需要人工放水就可以汲来作制盐的天然卤源。过去一眼盐井只能提两万多担卤水，现在已经能提十三、四万担卤水了。
    纵横交错的输卤枧管，是盐场上令人注目的景物之一。这些全部由楠竹制成的巨蟒般的输卤枧管，带着刚从盐井内汲出来的卤水，越过田野和山坡，跨过清清的河流，穿过市区的上空，把卤水输送到十多公里以外的煮盐车间，用天然气或煤煎煮成盐。如果将全市枧管衔接起来，长度可达一百二十七公里。对于这，萧绍成同志带着自豪的神情对我说：“当我们的祖先开始用这物美价廉的‘盐场自来水管’输卤的时候，世界上还没有发现自来水的原理呢！”
    盐厂里最使人感到兴趣的，要算是用来煮盐的火井了。在那深邃狭小的井口里，日夜向上喷吐着蓝茵茵的瓦斯火焰（天然气）。这种火井，小的能烧两三口盐锅，大的能烧二、三百口。
    是什么人，在什么时候开始凿出这样深的盐井呢？从什么时候起人们就发现用地下瓦斯来煮盐了呢？据中共自贡市委的同志说：早在两千年前的秦朝，这里就开始凿井了。到了唐朝，自贡蕴藏的天然气被发现了，开凿的规模也扩大了。在宋朝的时候（公元九六○年至一二七九年），我国的劳动人民更进一步地大量开凿瓦斯火井。它比英国在1886年才用瓦斯来点灯要早几个世纪。
    富饶的盐都，在国民党统治下的黑暗岁月里，生产萎缩，井灶倒闭，人民生活十分痛苦。从1937年到1947年的十年间，盐价上涨了二十七倍，连盐工们吃的盐都有“斗米斤盐”的说法。盐工们为反抗苛重的剥削和压迫，曾英勇地进行了斗争。仅1926年一年，在中共地下组织领导下，全市盐工就进行过十多次罢工。
    富有光荣革命传统的自贡盐工，从1949年12月5日解放那天起，便全力投入恢复和发展盐业生产的斗争。破烂荒凉的盐场修复了，倒斜的井架立起了，煎盐的火灶又燃烧起来了，盐的产量迅速提高。去年，盐工们以忘我的劳动，提前完成全年计划，产盐801万担，超过历史上最高年产量的60％以上，现在全市盐工正在为超额完成1956年产盐850万担的任务而奋斗。
    盐场上充满着蓬勃建设的景象。许多不久前还是荒僻的田野，现在变成热闹的工地，高耸起了钻机的井架。新建立的国营盐务局第一、二车间，使千百年来分散落后的自贡盐业，从简陋的手工操作，变成了半机械化和机械化的生产。特等劳动模范徐大兴创造的“筒内汲卤器”，其他盐工创造的“自动量卤器”、“自动压油杯”等，大大改善了职工的劳动条件，提高了劳动生产率，减少了废品，降低了成本。为着提取盐卤中含有的钾、碘、溴、硼砂等十多种贵重的化工原料，自贡市新建起一座近代化的化工厂，不久以后，还将有更多的化工厂出现在盐都。
    在今年的社会主义改造高潮中，自贡市大小盐场全部实行了公私合营。对于这个翻天复地的变化，中共自贡市委牟海秀同志有一次对我说：
    “按照社会主义企业的管理原则，我们把30里范围内的100多个小井小灶，组织成了建华、久大两个大的公司。在这两个公司里，以地区为单位，以七、八个小井、灶联合组成十七个大的车间。由于建立和健全了企业管理的机构，井盐的生产由过去那种分散落后的手工业生产方式，变成了大生产。在这两个企业中，我们推行了各种管理制度，对某些陈旧的生产设备，进行了规模较大的修整、改建。建华公司公私合营后，生产规模扩大了一倍；久大公司资产总值增加了四倍多。”
    这几年来，新建的职工宿舍达两万多平方公尺。过去，夏天工人们睡在竹板上，冬天困在篦包里，现在他们都高高兴兴地迁入了新居。过去工人们在低矮闷热的灶房里工作，夏天炎热的时候，有些工人就昏倒过去；现在厂房里不仅装上了较好的通风设备，久大公司第二制盐处还装上了屋顶喷水器，在瓦斯灶房里，也都设置了排除二氧化硫气体的烟囱。由于劳动条件和医疗设备的改进，几年来职工的病伤率已降低了60％多。
    工人的文化生活也日益活跃。全市有七千多职工在业余文化学校学习，过去一字不识的老工人，现在有许多能阅读报纸了。市中心区新建的工人文化宫和各工区的俱乐部里，经常有川流不息的工人前往打球、下棋、玩扑克。全市又为职工新建了两个电影院、两个川剧院、一个曲艺场，公园内新修的溜冰场、夜光球场，都是工人游息的地方。
    全市现在有中小学二十多所，新建师范学校，盐业技术学校两所。沿着釜溪河岸的市区，新修了不少房屋。平坦的马路上终日奔驰着公共汽车。新设的自来水给居住在山上的市民带来极大的方便。号称自贡市“龙须沟”的滨江马路一带，已经修起了整齐的石堤，洪水再也不会爬上堤岸。横跨河上的大铁桥也正在修建。可以预见，内昆铁路通车后，我们的盐都将更加繁荣！
