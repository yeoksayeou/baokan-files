Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, July 12th: The Fourth Congress of the Chinese Communist Party Taiyuan City Committee discussed the question of how party organizations can further care for the masses and implement the party's mass line.

The conference lasted four days and closed yesterday.

The delegates listened to the report made by Chi Biqing, First Secretary of the CPC Taiyuan City Committee. The report pointed out that with the deepening development of the city's surging advanced producer movement, party organizations have exposed undesirable tendencies such as subjectivism, bureaucratism, and commandism, which are detached from the masses, in their leadership work. The work style formed by this undesirable tendency, which neglects the living conditions of the workers and "coming from above and going below," has already brought adverse effects to the advanced producer movement on all fronts in the city.

Thirty-four delegates spoke at the meeting. They sharply exposed and criticized the erroneous views of some party organizations that did not care about the hardships of the masses, opposed being responsible to the higher authorities and being responsible to the masses, and opposed the personal interests of the masses and the collective interests. They inspected and criticized the bureaucratic and paperwork style of some party leaders who did not go deep into the masses, but only sat in the office to hold meetings, issue instructions, and orders.

The meeting believes that it is necessary to further care for the masses and implement the party's mass line, and requires party organizations at all levels to take effective measures to improve the ideological level of leading cadres. These cadres should complete the study of five documents such as "Rectifying the Party's Style of Work" within one year, and conduct a general training on the mass viewpoint and mass line for grassroots leading cadres.

In order to quickly reverse the bureaucratic tendency of not caring about the hardships of the masses, the meeting required all enterprise departments in the city to take measures to provide subsidies to workers with financial difficulties, establish a regular promotion system and improve the reward system while doing a good job in wage reform, and systematically and actively solve various welfare facilities problems such as worker housing, canteens, children's schools, and hospitals.

The meeting emphasized that when implementing each policy instruction of the party, party organizations at all levels must develop a good work style of consulting with the masses, promote inner-party democracy, and fully carry out criticism and self-criticism, paying special attention to bottom-up criticism and criticism from the people, so as to effectively eliminate shortcomings and errors in work. A system of collective leadership with division of labor and responsibility under the Party Committee should be established in enterprises, and the administrative command style should be resolutely corrected. Leading cadres at the city and district levels should spend at least one day a week going deep into the field and participating in activities among the people. The municipal and district party committees should hold a leadership experience exchange meeting for grassroots organizations every six months. Enterprise leaders should spend more time understanding the hardships of workers and listening to their opinions. All grassroots party organizations should discuss issues related to the vital interests of the masses at least once every three months, and take effective measures to solve them in a timely manner.

Finally, the meeting made a resolution based on the above situation and opinions.

    中共太原市第四次代表会议
    决定进一步执行党的群众路线
    对某些党组织脱离群众和不关心群众疾苦的现象作了揭发批判
    新华社太原12日电　中国共产党太原市第四次代表会议讨论了党组织如何进一步关心群众、贯彻执行党的群众路线的问题。
    这次会议共举行了四天，已在昨天闭幕。
    代表们听了中共太原市委员会第一书记池必卿作的报告。这个报告指出，随着全市高涨的先进生产者运动的深入发展，党组织在领导工作中暴露出了主观主义、官僚主义和命令主义等脱离群众的不良倾向。这种不良倾向所形成的忽视职工群众生活状况和“从上边来到下边去”的工作作风，已经给全市各个战线上的先进生产者运动带来了不利的影响。
    有三十四个代表在会上发了言。他们对于某些党组织不关心群众疾苦、把对上级负责和对群众负责对立起来、把群众的个人利益和集体利益对立起来等错误观点，进行了尖锐的揭发和批判；对于某些党的领导干部不深入群众，只坐在办公室里开会、发布指示和命令的官僚主义和文牍主义作风，进行了检查和批评。
    会议认为，必须进一步关心群众和贯彻执行党的群众路线，要求各级党组织采取有效措施来提高领导干部的思想水平，这些干部要在一年中学完“整顿党的作风”等五种文件，并且对基层领导干部普遍进行一次群众观点和群众路线的训练。
    为了迅速扭转不关心群众疾苦的官僚主义倾向，会议要求全市各企业部门采取措施，对生活上有困难的职工给予补助，在作好工资改革的同时建立经常性的晋级制度、健全奖励制度，并且对职工住宅、食堂、子弟学校、医院等各种生活福利设施问题，有步骤地和积极地加以解决。
    会议强调指出，各级党组织在贯彻执行党的每一项政策指示的时候，都必须养成和群众商量的优良作风，发扬党内民主，充分开展批评与自我批评，特别注意自下而上的和来自人民群众的批评，以便有效地消除工作中的缺点和错误。在企业中应当建立党委集体领导分工负责制，坚决纠正行政命令作风。市级和区级的领导干部，每周至少要有一天时间深入现场，在人民群众中活动。市区党委每半年要召开一次基层组织的领导经验交流会议。企业的领导干部要用更多的时间了解职工的疾苦和听取他们的意见。所有基层党组织每三个月至少要讨论一次有关群众切身利益的问题，并且采取有效办法及时加以解决。
    会议最后根据上述情况和意见作出决议。
