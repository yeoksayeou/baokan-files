    Hengda Brand Cigarettes Are Getting Worse
    I started smoking Hengda brand unpackaged cigarettes last summer. Back then, Hengda cigarettes had a pure flavor, the cigarette sticks were neither too loose nor too tight, and the tobacco shreds were neither too coarse nor too fine. I even thought they were not inferior to unpackaged Qianmen brand. However, in recent months, these cigarettes have been getting worse day by day. Some cigarette sticks are very loose; tapping them on the table a few times can leave a long empty space. Some cigarette sticks constantly shed tobacco into the mouth when smoked. Some cigarette sticks have large pieces of uncut tobacco stems inside. Especially the paper used for the cigarettes, when smoked, the lit area turns black. These are all phenomena that did not exist in the past. I sincerely hope that the Tianjin Hengda Tobacco Factory will quickly improve product quality. (Yiming)

    恒大牌卷烟越来越坏
    我从去年夏天起就开始吸恒大牌简装卷烟。那时候的恒大烟烟味纯正，烟支不松不紧，烟丝不粗也不细，我甚至认为它并不次于简装的大前门牌。可是，最近几个月来，这种烟却一日不如一日了。有些烟支很松，向棹子上顿几下就能空出很长一截。有的烟支在吸的时候，烟丝不断地往嘴里跑。有的烟支肚子里有大块没有切碎的烟梗。尤其是卷烟用的纸，抽起来着火的地方就黑一圈。这些都是过去没有的现象。我衷心希望天津恒大烟草厂赶快提高产品质量。　　（一鸣）
