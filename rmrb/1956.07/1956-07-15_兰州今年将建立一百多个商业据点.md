    Lanzhou to Establish Over a Hundred Commercial Outlets This Year

    (Our Newspaper) In order to meet the needs of production workers in factories and mines and construction workers on construction sites, the Lanzhou Municipal Bureau of Commerce plans to establish over a hundred commercial outlets this year in industrial and newly built areas, including department stores, catering, food, vegetables, coal and building materials, textiles, and welfare industries. More than fifty outlets have already been built, and another fifty or so will be completed in the third quarter. Before the end of the year, the Bureau of Commerce also plans to move one restaurant each from Shanghai and Tianjin to the industrial area to supply workers from East and North China who come to Lanzhou to participate in construction.

    In addition to operating at storefronts, these commercial outlets will adopt a door-to-door delivery approach for workers' family dormitories with concentrated housing, delivering fuel and meat to workers' doors. In addition, mobile teams will circulate to supply workers with daily necessities such as cigarettes, candies, and soap. (Yan Shugui)

    兰州今年将建立一百多个商业据点
    本报讯　为了满足厂矿企业生产职工和建设工地建筑职工的需要，兰州市商业局计划今年在工业区和新建区建立一百多个商业据点，包括百货、饮食、食品、蔬菜、煤建、纺织、福利等行业。现在有五十多个据点已经建成，另外五十多个据点将在第三季度建成。在年底前，商业局还计划在工业区由上海、天津各迁去一个饭馆，供应来兰州参加建设的华东、华北工人。
    这些商业据点除在门市部营业外，对于居住集中的职工家属宿舍采用送货上门的方式，把燃料、肉食等送到职工门上。另外职工日常需要的一些杂货，如香烟、糖果、肥皂等，也由流动小组巡回供应。（燕树桂）
