A new atmosphere has recently emerged among the families of workers at the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant: family members are very concerned about the lives of the workers. In the past few days, the trade union organizations of the steelmaking, rolling, and refractory materials departments of the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant have collected many workers' feedback. The workers said that recently their mothers, wives, sisters, and younger sisters have been very considerate of them. They spend less money, but eat better. Family members also don't let them do much housework, so workers can rest well after work.

This new atmosphere of infinite consideration for workers appeared after these workers' family members visited the workshops as new guests in the first half of July.

Since July, the three workshops of the steelmaking, rolling, and refractory materials departments have organized large numbers of employees' family members to visit. In the steelmaking and rolling departments alone, more than 430 workers' family members have visited. Accompanied by guides, these family members visited the main production processes of each workshop. They saw the intense labor of their loved ones, and also saw the sweat and effort their loved ones put into building the motherland. Some family members said, "Before, I thought they were just sitting comfortably next to the machine watching it, but now it seems that's not the case at all." After seeing the intense labor of the steelmaking workers, Li Guizhi's wife said with emotion, "I can't ask him to do housework when he gets home in the future. I have to compare myself to him. I live too easily!" Some family members who had not cared enough about the workers in the past were even more moved. They said that because they didn't understand the workers' labor situation, they didn't take good care of them in life, and they felt very ashamed.

Two family members who were considerate of the workers, Wang Chengfeng and Song Sujuan, received awards from the workshop leadership when they visited the rolling department.

The workers said, "The trade union has grasped the key to thinking this time! We eat well, dress well, don't have quarrels, and rest well. We have no burden when we go to work!"

    工人家庭的新气象
    在太原钢铁厂工人的家庭中间，最近出现了一种新气象——家属们非常关心工人们的生活。最近几天，太原钢铁厂炼钢部、轧钢部和耐火材料部的工会组织收集了许多工人的反映。工人们说，最近他们的母亲、妻子、姐姐和妹妹们对他们非常体贴。花钱少了，吃的反而好了。家属们也不让他们多管家里的事，因此，下班以后，工人们都能很好地休息。
    这种对工人无限体贴的新气象是这些工人家属在七月上半月去车间里当了一次新客人以后出现的。
    七月以来，炼钢部、轧钢部、耐火材料部三个车间组织了大批职工家属来参观。仅炼钢、轧钢两部，参观过的工人家属就有四百三十多人。这些家属在说明员的陪同下，参观了各车间主要的生产过程，她们看到她们的亲人的紧张劳动，也看到了她们的亲人在建设祖国的事业中所流出的汗和花费的力量。有的家属说：“以前以为他们不过坐在机器旁边舒舒服服看机器，现在看来，完全不是那么回事儿。”李桂只的爱人看见炼钢工人们的紧张劳动以后，感动地说：“往后可再不能叫人家回家干活啦，要和他们比一下，自己可活得太轻闲啦！”一些在过去对工人关心不够的家属受到了更深的感动。她们说，因为不了解工人的劳动状况，生活上没有好好照顾他们，感到很抱愧。
    两位体贴工人的家属——王成凤、宋素娟在参观轧钢部的时候，接受了车间领导部门给予她们的奖励。
    工人们说：“工会这一下可抓住思想关键啦！吃得好、穿得好、不吵不闹也休息得好，咱上班再也没有负担啦！”
