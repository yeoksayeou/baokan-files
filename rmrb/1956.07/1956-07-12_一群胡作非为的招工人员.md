    A Group of Reckless Recruiters
    In April of this year, the Hebei Provincial Textile Bureau and its subordinate state-owned Shijiazhuang No. 2 and No. 3 Cotton Textile Factories sent people to Tianjin to recruit workers. These recruiters privately stipulated many inexplicable and absurd rules to refuse qualified personnel. For example, Guo Jiaxiu is twenty-five years old this year, in good health, and scored 100 in both Chinese and mathematics, but the recruiters said that his body was "coarse" and "clumsy" and refused to hire him. Zhao Tianmin had worked in a textile factory before and had certain textile skills, but the recruiters wrote "This person's hands are rough and clumsy, not to be hired" on his oral examination form. Wang Fengde's age and education level were both qualified, but he was not good at speaking. During the oral examination, he could not answer fluently. The recruiters wrote "dull, fool" on his oral examination form and decided not to hire him. Unemployed workers Song Shuling, Li Xiuying, Zhang Xiumin, Tong Jinying, and others all had qualified ages, education levels, and political conditions, but the recruiting unit refused to hire them because they had body odor. Li Xiuying, with the consent of the recruiting unit, borrowed more than 20 yuan to go to the hospital for treatment; but after the body odor was cured, the recruiting unit still refused to hire her. Some people were not hired for reasons such as "too tall" or "too short." The most serious thing is that the recruiting unit refused to hire pregnant women across the board. Tao Jiaping is a Communist Party member, a people's representative of Hexi District in Tianjin, twenty-four years old, with a junior high school first grade education level, and in good health, but the recruiting unit refused to hire her simply because she was four months pregnant. Jing Suqing, the secretary of the Communist Youth League branch in the Southwest Building New Village of Tianjin, is twenty-three years old, with a junior high school first grade education level, and in good health, and was also not hired because of pregnancy.
    The work style of these recruiters is also very bad. During the physical examination, they demanded that female applicants undergo naked examinations. The hospital suggested that the focus of physical examinations for textile workers should be on the heart, lungs, and blood pressure, and that naked examinations were not necessary at all. However, the recruiters unreasonably said: "We paid the money, so you have to give us the examination!" During the oral examination, some recruiters asked female workers some inexplicable questions in an extremely unserious manner, such as "When do you have your period?" and "Do you often get close to men?" The female workers were very unhappy, but they were afraid that raising objections would cause them to fail the exam, so they dared not say anything to their faces and had to answer reluctantly. Cao Wenhua, a female Youth League member, was so unable to answer the questions that she cried in anger and confronted the recruiters; the recruiters said aggressively, "Looking at you like this, we can't take you either." Sure enough, Cao Wenhua was not hired! Once, the comrades from the Tianjin Labor Bureau heard that these questions from the recruiters had exceeded the scope of a general oral examination and raised objections on the spot, but the answer they received was: "I have the right to ask like this!"
    These recruiters also have a very bad attitude towards the government agencies in the areas where they are recruiting. They said repeatedly that they were "here to solve the problem of unemployed workers for you," and they acted like overlords to the comrades in the district. The Hebei District People's Committee had prepared office space for them in advance, but they complained that the house was not good and demanded that the house of the District Consultative Committee be vacated for them; some comrades reflected that it was as if "imperial envoys" had arrived.
    It is conceivable what kind of negative impact it has when this kind of attitude of capitalists in the old society towards workers appears in the people representing state-owned enterprises in recruiting workers. Some applicants have already written letters to the local government to file complaints. I suggest that the Ministry of Textile Industry and the Ministry of Labor jointly investigate and deal with this matter and give these reckless recruiters the punishment they deserve.

    一群胡作非为的招工人员
    今年四月，河北省纺织管理局和所属国营石家庄第二、第三两个棉纺织厂派人到天津来招收工人。这些招工人员私自规定了许多莫名其妙的清规戒律，来拒绝录用合格的人员。例如，郭家修今年二十五岁，身体健康，语文和数学都考了一百分，但是招工人员说他身体“粗大”“笨”，不予录取。赵天民过去曾经在纺织厂工作过，有一定的纺织技术，但是招工人员在口试表上批上“该人手粗笨，不予录取”。王凤德的年龄和文化水平都合格，但是不善于说话，在口试的时候不能应答如流，招工人员竟在口试表上批上“呆笨，傻子”几个字，决定不录取。失业工人宋淑玲、李秀英、张秀敏、佟金英等人的年龄、文化水平和政治条件都合格，但是招工单位因为她们有狐臭拒绝录用。李秀英征得招工单位同意以后，借了二十多元钱到医院去治疗；但是在狐臭治好以后，招工单位仍然不同意录用她。还有一些人因为“个子太长”、“个子太低”等理由而没有被录取。最严重的是，招工单位对孕妇一概拒绝录用。陶家萍是个共产党员，天津市河西区的人民代表，二十四岁，初中一年级的文化水平，身体健康，但是招工单位就因为她已经怀孕四个月，拒绝录用。天津市西南楼新村的团支部书记荆素青，二十三岁，初中一年级文化水平，身体健康，也是因为怀孕没有被录用。
    这些招工人员的作风也很恶劣。在检查体格的时候，他们要应试女工裸体检查。医院提出意见说：纺织部门招用工人，体格检查的重点应该放在心、肺和血压等方面，根本不需要裸体检查。但是招工人员蛮不讲理地说：“我们花了钱，你们就得给检查！”在口试的时候，某些招工人员用极不严肃的态度对女工问了一些莫名其妙的话，如“你什么时候来月经？”“你常和男子接近吧？”女工都很有意见，但是又怕提意见会考不取，因此当面不敢说什么，只得勉强回答。女青年团员曹文华被问得实在没有办法回答了，气得哭起来，当面顶了招工人员两句；招工人员就气势汹汹地说：“瞧你这样，也不能要你。”果然，曹文华就没有被录取！有一次，天津市劳动局的同志听到招工人员的这些问话已经超出了一般口试的范围，当场提出意见，但是得到的答复是：“我有权利这样问！”
    这些招工人员对招工所在地区的政府机关态度也很坏。他们口口声声说是“来给你们解决失业工人问题的”，对区里的同志作威作福。河北区人民委员会事先给他们准备好了办公房屋，他们却嫌房子不好，要求把区协商委员会的房子给他们让出来；有的同志就反映：简直是“钦差大臣”来了。
    像这种旧社会资本家对待工人的态度，居然出现在代表国营企业招工的人员身上，造成的不良影响是可以想见的。有些应试的工人已经写信向当地政府提出了控诉。我建议纺织工业部和劳动部共同来调查和处理这件事，给这些胡作非为的招工人员以应得的处分。
