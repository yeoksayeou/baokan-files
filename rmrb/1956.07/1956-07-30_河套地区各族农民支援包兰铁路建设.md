Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, July 28th: The first group of 1,000 laborers from various ethnic groups, including Mongolian and Han, in the Hetao area of Inner Mongolia in the middle reaches of the Yellow River, who are supporting the construction of the Baotou-Lanzhou Railway, have all arrived at the construction line before July 25th. The Baotou-Lanzhou Railway extends from Baotou for over one hundred kilometers in a northwest direction and enters the famous Yellow River Hetao area. The farmers of all ethnic groups in the Hetao Plain are excited about the construction of the railway and have already organized a second support team, ready to depart. They are also preparing to increase vegetable cultivation by more than 80,000 mu along the railway line to supply food for the railway workers. Many relevant departments have also made plans to support the construction of the railway. In order to uniformly allocate support forces, the Hetao Administrative Region Support Baotou-Lanzhou Railway Construction Committee has been established.

In the past, due to the closed traffic in the rich Yellow River Hetao area, a large amount of surplus grain and animal products were difficult to transport out, and industrial products could not be transported in time, which restricted the improvement of the lives of people of all ethnic groups.

    河套地区各族农民支援包兰铁路建设
    新华社呼和浩特28日电　黄河中游内蒙古河套地区第一批支援修建包（头）兰（州）铁路的一千名蒙汉等族民工，在七月二十五日以前全部到达施工线上。包兰铁路从包头向西北方向伸延一百几十公里就进入著名的黄河河套地区。河套平原的各族农民为兴修铁路所振奋，已经组织了第二批支援队伍，待命出发。他们还准备在铁路沿线增种蔬菜八万多亩，供应筑路职工食用。不少有关部门也作出了支援铁路建设的计划。为统一调配支援力量，河套行政区域支援包兰铁路建设委员会已经成立。
    富饶的黄河后套，过去因为交通闭塞，大批余粮和畜产品难以外运，工业品也不能及时运进来，使各族人民生活的改善受到了限制。
