    Writing News Should Always Consider the Reader
    The People's Daily published a news item on July 7th on page seven entitled "Jiaotong University to Begin Relocation to Xi'an in Mid-July." After reading it, I still couldn't figure out where Jiaotong University was moving to Xi'an from. Writing news should always consider the reader; you can't assume that just because the author and editor understand something, the reader will too. In fact, this kind of news that is either missing a nose or an eye is not at all unique in the newspaper.

    写新闻要处处为读者着想
    七月七日人民日报第七版登了一则题为“交通大学七月中旬开始迁往西安”的新闻，读后始终看不出交通大学究竟从何处迁往西安。写新闻应该处处为读者着想，不能以为只要作者、编者懂了的东西，读者也一定都懂的。其实这类不是缺鼻子就是缺眼睛的新闻，在报上还不是绝无仅有的。　（栩生）
