    This Loss Should Not Be Borne by the User
    All the raw coal used for coking at Anshan Iron and Steel is supplied by various coal mines under the Ministry of Coal Industry. Due to the poor dewatering work in most mines, the average moisture content of the coal is as high as 10% or more, exceeding the planned 5%. Transporting this kind of coal requires a lot of extra freight. From January to May this year, the excess moisture over the plan was 171,120 tons, wasting 3,422 railcars and losing 850,000 yuan in freight. This not only creates a false impression of inflated production costs, but also seriously affects the quality of coking coal.
    Last year, Anshan Iron and Steel sent people to various mines and relevant departments to request compensation for the losses and to improve coal washing and dewatering, but there were no results. The State Planning Commission stipulates that this loss should be borne by the user. I think this regulation is unreasonable. The freight loss caused by excessive moisture in washed coal should be borne by the coal mine. Otherwise, it will not only violate the enterprise's planned management system and economic accounting principles, but also fail to promote the coal producing units to improve the coal washing and dewatering work.

    这项损失不该用户负担
    我们鞍钢炼焦用的全部原料煤，都是由煤炭工业部所属各煤矿供应的。由于多数矿山的脱水工作做得不好，煤的平均水分高达10％以上，超过计划5％。运这种煤，要多支出很多运费。今年一至五月超过计划的水分有十七万一千一百二十吨，浪费车皮三千四百二十二辆，损失运费八十五万元。这样不仅造成了生产费虚增的假象，而且严重地影响炼焦煤质量。
    去年，鞍钢曾派人向各矿及有关部门要求补偿损失，并改善洗煤脱水情况，但是没有什么结果。国家计划委员会规定这项损失由用户负担，我认为这个规定是不合理的。洗煤水分过高造成运费损失，应该由煤矿负担。否则，不仅与企业的计划管理制度和经济核算原则相违背，而且不能促使产煤单位改进洗煤脱水工作。		鞍钢会计处　苏伯光
