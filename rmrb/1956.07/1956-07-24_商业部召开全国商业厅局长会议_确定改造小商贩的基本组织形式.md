Xinhua News Agency, July 23rd—The State's socialist transformation of private commerce for the second half of the year has been discussed at the National Conference of Commercial Department Directors convened by the Ministry of Commerce.

    The conference mainly studied the problems that currently exist for the scattered small vendors and peddlers across various regions concerning sources of goods, capital, tax burdens, and organizing to embark on the socialist path, and proposed solutions.

    The conference believes that the basic organizational form for carrying out the socialist transformation of the 2.4 million small vendors and peddlers nationwide is the cooperative group. These cooperative groups can engage in joint purchasing and separate sales, with each bearing its own profits and losses, or they can operate separately, each bearing its own profits and losses. Joint purchasing is adopted when economically necessary, and is not mandatory otherwise. This type of cooperative group should be distinguished from the cooperative stores that have already been organized, which adopt joint purchasing and joint sales, sharing profits and losses (some of which are also nominally called cooperative groups).

    The organizational steps for cooperative groups should currently focus on starting with industries and households facing difficulties. Efforts should be made to basically organize industries and households facing difficulties before the end of the third quarter of this year (in a few places with large numbers of small vendors and peddlers, the time can be extended). By the end of this year or the end of the first quarter of next year, all existing small vendors and peddlers should be basically organized. During the organization process, the principle of voluntarism should be followed, and it should be carried out in stages, by industry and by trade. State-owned commercial departments in various regions should designate state-owned wholesale departments, state-owned retail stores, or joint state-private retail stores as central stores, responsible for managing several cooperative groups and organizing the supply of goods.

    The conference affirmed that the form of cooperative stores is a necessary one and can be stabilized, without further arbitrary changes. In the future, they can directly transition into state-owned stores. Currently, in general, cooperative stores should not be converted into joint state-private stores, nor should there be undue haste in converting them into state-owned stores.

    The conference believes that the current difficulties in the supply of goods for small vendors and peddlers can be roughly divided into two types: one that state-owned commerce can resolve, which should be actively resolved in the future; and one that state-owned commerce cannot solve alone, such as the grain needed by the catering industry and for making non-staple foods, handicrafts, and certain small local products. State-owned commercial departments must make suggestions to relevant departments, requesting assistance in solving these. Regarding how to help small vendors and peddlers solve their tax and capital difficulties, the conference discussed the initial drafts of new tax and loan measures recently drafted by the Ministry of Finance and the People's Bank, basically agreeing with these measures. At the same time, it proposed that after the bank loan problem is resolved, cooperative groups should try their best to pay cash for goods purchased from state-owned commercial departments, with consignment sales as a supplement.

    Under the conditions of voluntarism and possibility of all members, the cooperative group can extract a portion of public welfare funds to run collective welfare undertakings for the group, especially to subsidize the needs of births, old age, sickness, death, injuries, and disabilities.

    Regarding the personnel arrangements for capitalist personnel and their collaboration in enterprises, the conference believes that wholesalers who closed down after January 1, 1954, including employees and capitalist personnel, should all be absorbed and placed. Wholesalers who closed down before January 1, 1954, closed down for complex reasons, and a considerable portion of them did not close down because of the development of state-owned commercial wholesale business. Therefore, the method of the commercial departments unilaterally taking responsibility for placement cannot be adopted, and it should be resolved in social employment. Commercial personnel with technical skills that are needed by commercial departments can also be absorbed. Some commercial personnel in society with advanced skills who have improperly changed jobs can also be returned to the commercial departments to work after the state-owned commercial departments consult with the transfer departments and obtain their consent. In the joint state-private ownership of the entire industry, all old and sick employees and private personnel in all joint ventures and cooperative stores must continue to be employed.

    Collaborating with capitalists in joint state-private enterprises, giving play to their strengths, overcoming their shortcomings, and helping them transform themselves in their work is one of the current political tasks of state-owned commercial cadres, and it is also the key to doing a good job in state-private relations. In order to do this work well, the conference stipulated that in the future, the central stores that manage cooperative groups, the specialized companies that manage joint state-private enterprises, and the grassroots business units with a large number of private personnel must establish institutions or full-time personnel to manage private personnel, responsible for uniting, educating, and transforming private personnel.

    The conference also proposed that state-owned commerce, joint state-private commerce, cooperative stores, and cooperative groups should have some division of labor in retail commodity operations. In the past, some stores only sold high-end and mid-range goods, some stores mainly sold mid-range and low-end goods, some large department stores did not sell odd and end merchandise, some stores mainly bought and sold several types of goods, with other goods as supplements, and some stores had large seasonal changes in the goods they operated. These division of labor methods of old commerce were naturally formed to adapt to objective economic laws. The conference required various regions to study these old division of labor methods and restore the useful parts, so as to give play to the potential of various types of commercial institutions and reduce the phenomenon of excessive crowding in state-owned stores.

### 商业部召开全国商业厅局长会议  确定改造小商贩的基本组织形式

    商业部召开全国商业厅局长会议
    确定改造小商贩的基本组织形式
    提出帮助小商贩解决货源、资金、税收负担问题的办法
    新华社23日讯　国家下半年对私营商业的社会主义改造工作，已经在商业部召开的全国商业厅局长会议上进行了讨论。
    会议主要研究了目前各地　分散经营的小商小贩在货源、资金、税收负担和组织起来走向社会主义道路等方面所存在的问题，并且提出了解决的办法。
    会议认为对全国二百四十万户小商小贩进行社会主义改造的基本组织形式是合作小组。这种合作小组可以联购分销、各负盈亏，也可以分散经营、各负盈亏。在经济上需要联购的就联购，不需要联购的也可以不联购。这种合作小组，同过去已经组织起来的采取联购联销、共负盈亏的合作商店（有些在名义上也叫合作小组）应有所区别。
    合作小组的组织步骤，目前着重从困难行业和困难户着手，争取在今年第三季度末以前，基本上把困难行业和困难户组织起来（少数小商小贩人数很多的地方，时间可以延长一些），在今年年底或明年第一季度末，把现有的全部小商小贩基本上组织起来。组织的时候，应该根据自愿的原则，并且分期地分行分业地逐步进行。各地国营商业部门要指定国营批发部、国营零售商店或公私合营零售商店为中心店，负责管理若干合作小组，并且组织货源供应。
    会议肯定合作商店的形式是一种必要的形式，可以稳定下来，不要再随意变动，将来可以直接过渡为国营商店。现在一般不要把合作商店转为公私合营商店，也不要急于去转变为国营商店。
    会议认为目前小商小贩的货源困难，大致可以分为两种，一种是国营商业所能解决的，今后要积极加以解决；一种是国营商业不能单独解决的，如饮食业需要的和制作副食品用的粮食，手工业品和某些小土产，国营商业部门必须向有关部门提出建议，要求帮助解决。关于如何帮助小商小贩解决税收和资金上的困难，会议讨论了最近财政部和人民银行分别起草的新的税收和贷款办法的初稿，基本上同意这些办法，同时提出在银行贷款问题解决以后，今后合作小组向国营商业部门进货，应尽量做到以现款代销为主，以欠款代销为辅。
    合作小组在全体成员自愿和可能的条件下，可以提取一部分公益金，举办小组的集体福利事业，特别是补助生、老、病、死、伤、残的需要。
    关于对资方人员的人事安排和在企业中的共事问题，会议认为对于在1954年1月1日以后歇业的批发商，包括职工和资方人员，都应当吸收安置工作。在1954年1月1日以前歇业的批发商，因为歇业的原因复杂，其中有相当一部分并不是因为国营商业的批发业务发展而歇业的，因此不能采取由商业部门一律包下来安置的办法，应当在社会就业中加以解决，对其中有技术的商业人员，商业部门在业务上需要的，也可以吸收。社会上有些有高级技术的商业人员，转业不当的，也可以由国营商业部门同转业部门商量，在取得他们同意后，回到商业部门来工作。在全行业公私合营中，对一切合营企业内和合作商店内年老的、有病的职工和私方人员都要继续录用。
    在公私合营企业中同资本家共事，发挥他们的长处，克服他们的短处，在工作中帮助他们改造，是国营商业干部当前的政治任务之一，也是搞好公私关系的关键。为了做好这个工作，会议规定：今后管理合作小组的中心店、管理公私合营企业的专业公司和私方人员较多的基层业务单位，都要设立管理私方人员的机构或专职人员，负责对私方人员进行团结、教育和改造工作。
    会议还提出国营商业、公私合营商业、合作商店、合作小组在零售商品经营上应该有所分工。过去，有些商店只卖高档货和中档货，有些商店主要卖中档货和低档货，有些大的百货店不卖零星百货，有些商店以买几类商品为主，其他商品为辅，有些商店经营的商品有很大的季节变化。旧商业的这些分工办法，是适应客观的经济规律自然形成的。会议要求各地研究这些旧有的分工办法，恢复其中合用的部分，这样才能发挥各种类型的商业机构的潜力，减少国营商店过分拥挤的现象。
