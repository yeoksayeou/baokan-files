Xinhua News Agency, 26th dispatch: The 1956 demobilized soldier placement work has basically concluded. Currently, various regions are organizing inspection teams to conduct comprehensive and in-depth checks on issues such as improper job assignments, less-than-reasonable salary and benefits, and a small number of demobilized soldiers not yet placed in certain departments during the placement of demobilized soldiers.
This year, Party and government leading organs at all levels have attached great importance to the placement of demobilized soldiers. Many organs, organizations, factories, mines, enterprises, and agricultural production cooperatives prepared for the reception and placement of demobilized soldiers before they even arrived, ensuring that the demobilized soldiers returning to various regions this year largely achieved "receive and settle upon arrival" and "join the commune upon return home."
Demobilized soldiers returning to rural areas have basically joined agricultural production cooperatives. According to surveys in some areas of Anhui Province, 98% of demobilized soldiers have joined cooperatives, with an average of 85% joining advanced cooperatives. In Ziyuan County, Guangxi Province, over 80% of the 208 demobilized soldiers who returned home this year have taken on leading positions in cooperatives and township governments. Many demobilized soldiers have also invested their production assistance funds into agricultural production cooperatives to help solve production difficulties. For example, in Xiangtan County, Hunan Province, the 1,500 demobilized soldiers who returned home this year invested 191,212 yuan in agricultural cooperatives.
For demobilized soldiers with technical skills and education, a placement method of division of labor between the central and local governments was adopted this year, with the relevant central departments placing approximately 120,000 people. When assigning them jobs, all units generally considered their original ranks and work nature in the military, ensuring that they largely obtained jobs that were the same or similar to their work in the military. In addition, tens of thousands of demobilized soldiers have also been employed by local people's governments at all levels.
In order to solve some of the existing problems in the placement work, inspection teams organized by various regions are conducting comprehensive inspections. According to incomplete statistics from fifteen provinces and cities, as many as seventy-seven inspection teams have been dispatched recently, with nearly three hundred cadres participating, including cadres from the provincial Party committees, provincial people's committees, and other relevant departments.
Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 26th dispatch: The demobilized soldiers who returned to their hometowns in Shandong Province in the first half of this year have basically been properly settled. Demobilized soldiers who live in rural areas and returned home to participate in agricultural production have been settled in their hometowns. Various localities have used public houses and public land in rural areas to help demobilized soldiers who have no homes to settle down. Among the demobilized soldiers who live in towns and have a certain level of education and technical skills, 11,243 have joined organs, factories, mines, and enterprises.
Over 95% of the demobilized soldiers who returned to rural areas in the first half of the year have joined agricultural production cooperatives. In the Tai'an area, 3,971 demobilized soldiers were elected as chairmen of agricultural production cooperatives, and another 3,709 served as township cadres.

### 随接收随安置　随回乡随入社  今年复员军人安置工作基本结束

    随接收随安置　随回乡随入社
    今年复员军人安置工作基本结束
    据新华社26日讯　1956年的复员军人安置工作已经基本结束。目前各地正组织检查组对某些部门在安置复员军人时工作分配不当、工资待遇不尽合理和少数复员军人尚未得到安置等问题进行全面深入的检查。
    今年地方各级党政领导机关对安置复员军人的工作十分重视。许多机关、团体、厂矿企业和农业生产合作社，在复员军人还没有到达以前，就做好了接收和安置复员军人的准备工作，使今年回到各地的复员军人大体上做到了“随接收随安置”，“随回乡随入社”。
    回到农村的复员军人已经基本上都加入了农业生产合作社。据安徽省部分地区调查，有98％的复员军人加入合作社，其中加入高级社的平均占85％。广西省资源县今年回乡的208名复员军人中有80％以上担任了合作社、乡政权的主要干部。许多复员军人还把自己的生产资助金投入农业生产合作社，帮助解决合作社生产上的困难。例如湖南省湘潭县今年回乡的一千五百名复员军人就向农业社投资191，212元。
    对有技术有文化的复员军人，今年采取了由中央和地方分工负责的安置办法，由中央各有关部门安置的约达十二万多人。各单位在分配他们工作的时候，一般都照顾了他们原在部队的级别和工作性质，使他们大体上都得到了与原在部队工作性质相同或者相近的工作。此外，由地方各级人民政府安置就业的复员军人，也有好几万人。
    为了解决安置工作中存在的若干问题，各地组织的检查组正在进行全面的检查。据十五个省、市的不完全统计，最近派出的检查组就有七十七个，参加的干部包括中共省委、省人民委员会及其他有关部门的干部近三百名。
    据新华社济南26日电　山东省今年上半年回到家乡的复员军人已基本上得到了妥善的安置。家住农村回乡参加农业生产的复员军人，已在他们的家乡得到安置。各地对无家可归的复员军人，都用农村中的公房公地来帮助他们安家。家居城镇而又具备一定文化和技术水平的复员军人中已经有11，243人参加了机关、厂矿、企业单位工作。
    上半年回到农村的复员军人中已经有95％以上参加了农业生产合作社。泰安专区有3，971名复员军人被选为农业生产合作社的社长，另外还有3，709名担任了乡干部。
