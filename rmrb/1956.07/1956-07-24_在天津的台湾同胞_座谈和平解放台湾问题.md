Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, July 22nd: "Peaceful liberation of Taiwan is the most important concern of the people of the whole country, especially our Taiwan compatriots. No foreigner can interfere with our just cause of liberating our own territory." This was said by Liao Canhui, a Taiwan compatriot who returned from Japan in 1953, at a forum held in Tianjin today for Taiwan compatriots to discuss the peaceful liberation of Taiwan.

　　Liao Canhui is now a member of the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and an engineer at the Tianjin Design Institute. He also said: We have sufficient strength to liberate our own territory of Taiwan.

　　Taiwan compatriots who attended the forum unanimously supported the measures for peaceful liberation of Taiwan proposed by Premier Zhou Enlai. Wu Biao, Standing Committee member of the Chengnan District Committee of the CPPCC in Tianjin and Director of the Dongqiao Electrical Refrigerator Factory, said: Peaceful liberation of Taiwan can save Taiwan compatriots from the disasters of war. This is the deep concern of the motherland for the eight million Taiwan compatriots who are in dire straits. As a Taiwanese, how grateful I am!

　　Those who attended the forum today all talked about Taiwan's rich products and expressed infinite nostalgia for their hometown. Zhan Dewu, attending doctor of the Tianjin Stomatology Prevention and Treatment Hospital, said: I firmly believe that the Kuomintang military and political personnel who fled to Taiwan with Chiang Kai-shek must also miss their relatives living on the mainland of the motherland. As long as they abandon the darkness and turn to the light, they will have a good chance for a new life. I hope they dispel their concerns and work hard for the peaceful liberation of Taiwan, and I hope they organize tourist groups to visit the mainland of the motherland.

　　The thirty-one Taiwan compatriots who attended the forum were all overseas Chinese who returned from Japan successively since 1953.

    在天津的台湾同胞
    座谈和平解放台湾问题
    据新华社天津22日电　“和平解放台湾是全国人民特别是我们台湾同胞最关心的事，任何外国人都干涉不了我们解放自己领土的正义事业”。这是1953年从日本回来的台湾同胞廖灿辉在天津市今天举行的台湾同胞座谈和平解放台湾问题的座谈会上说的。
    廖灿辉现在是中国人民政治协商会议天津市委员会委员、天津设计院工程师。他还说：我们有足够的力量解放自己的领土台湾。
    参加座谈会的台湾同胞一致拥护周恩来总理所提出的和平解放台湾的措施。政协天津市城厢区委员会常务委员、东侨电气冰箱制造厂厂长吴标说：和平解放台湾可以使台湾同胞免于战争灾难，这是祖国对处在水深火热中的八百万台湾同胞的深切关怀。作为一个台湾人该是多么感激！
    今天参加座谈会的人都谈到了台湾丰富的物产，并且对故乡表示了无限的怀念。天津市牙病防治院主治大夫詹德戊说：我深信跟蒋介石跑到台湾去的国民党军政人员，一定也很怀念他们居住在祖国大陆上的亲人，只要他们弃暗投明，就是新生的好机会。希望他们打消顾虑，为和平解放台湾而努力，并且希望他们组织观光团到祖国大陆来参观访问。
    参加座谈会的三十一名台湾同胞都是1953年以来从日本陆续回国的华侨。
