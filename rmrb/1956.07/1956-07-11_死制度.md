    Dead System
    Huang Tian
    A People's Liberation Army soldier sent a sum of money to his mother. Simply because the recipient didn't have a personal seal, the postal worker didn't dare hand the letter to her, requiring her to bring her household registration booklet to the post office in person to collect it. The old woman did as she was told, and also brought her son's "Revolutionary Soldier Certificate" and a military dependent preferential treatment certificate with her photo on it. However, just because she lacked that carved seal, the post office负责人 (person in charge), despite having examined those documents, still refused. The old woman said indignantly, "Is it possible that I, as a person, am not worth as much as a wooden seal!"
    A critically ill cadre was carried to the designated medical institution for emergency treatment. Simply because there wasn't time to go to the outpatient department to complete referral procedures, the hospital refused to admit him. Contacting the outpatient department, they refused to issue the referral because there had been no prior diagnosis. After repeated negotiations, the procedures were finally completed, but the patient had already reached a nearly incurable state!
    These kinds of absurd things happen all the time. Because they happen so frequently, everyone has become accustomed to them.
    These people are rigidly clinging to dogma, turning the system into shackles that bind people. They believe that by doing so, they are being faithful to their duties and the system, while remaining indifferent to the suffering of others. To expose them, they are simply "cowards" who neither care about the interests of the masses nor are they afraid of "making mistakes."

    死制度
    黄恬
    一个解放军战士寄了一笔钱给母亲。只因收件人没有私章，邮递员不敢把信交给她，要她带上户口薄亲自到邮局去领。老人照着做了，同时还带去她儿子的“革命军人证明书”和贴有她的照片的军属优待证。但是，就因为她缺少那颗图章，邮局的负责人虽然验看了那些证明，还是不行。老人气愤愤地说：“难道我这个人还比不上一颗木刻的图章！”
    一个重病垂危的干部，被抬到指定住院的医疗机关去急诊。只因来不及到门诊单位办理介绍手续，医院不肯收容。到门诊单位联系，又因为没有经过诊断，也不肯给办介绍手续。经过再三交涉，才把手续办妥，但病人已到将近不可救药的地步了！
    这种怪事还有的是。因为太多的缘故，大家也就觉得平常了。
    这些人是死抱紧教条不放，把制度变成了束缚人们的枷锁。他们自以为，这样做正是忠实于职责和制度，而对他人的痛苦无动于衷。揭穿来看，他们只是既不关心群众利益、又害怕“犯错误”的“胆小鬼”而已。
