Three Thousand Households Exchange Residences

    (Our dispatch) Over the past few years, the Harbin Municipal Real Estate Administration has adjusted and exchanged residences for 3,011 households based on the principle of mutual consent. Among them, 64.3% were exchanges between employee residences located far from their workplace or across districts; 35.7% were intra-district exchanges to better match living space with family size. With the development of the city's economy, culture, and other aspects, the number of employees requesting residential exchanges is increasing daily. To adapt to this situation, the Real Estate Administration has recently formulated a work plan for adjusting employee housing.

    Organizing the exchange of houses has played a significant role in resolving housing problems, facilitating production, and reducing the economic burden on employees. (Song Yanping)

    三千户居民互换住宅
    本报讯　几年来，哈尔滨市房地产管理局根据双方自愿的原则，调剂互换住宅已有3，011户。其中，职工住宅与工作地址距离远、跨区互换的占64.3％；居住面积大小与人口多少不相适应、区内互换的占35.7％。随着全市经济、文化建设等各方面的发展，要求互相调换住宅的职工逐日增多。为了适应这种情况，房地产管理局最近又制定了调整职工住宅的工作方案。
    组织互换房屋，对解决住宅问题，便利生产以及减轻职工经济负担都起了很大的作用。（宋彦平）
