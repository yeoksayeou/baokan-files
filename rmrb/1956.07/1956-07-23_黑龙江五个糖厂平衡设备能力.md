Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 20th: Heilongjiang Province's five beet sugar factories are currently balancing their equipment capacity. The increased production capacity after the five factories balance their equipment will be equivalent to building a new mechanized sugar factory with a daily processing capacity of 1,100 tons of beets.

After the Hongguang and Heping sugar factories complete the ongoing projects of raising the height of the diffusion tanks and adding evaporation tanks, the production capacity of the two factories can be increased from 1,000 tons to 1,250 tons of beets per day. Acheng Sugar Factory is learning the "three fixed" operational method of "fixed time, fixed quantity, and fixed quality" from the diffusion section of Hongguang Sugar Factory to solve the contradiction that the production capacity of the diffusion process is less than that of other processes, and the production capacity can be increased from the current 1,051 tons to 1,129 tons of beets per day.

This year, due to the development of the advanced producer movement, the technical level and labor enthusiasm of the workers in the sugar factories of Heilongjiang Province have been greatly improved, and the production capacity of some processes in each factory has been broken through. The work of balancing equipment capacity currently being carried out by each factory is to adapt to this new situation, change the weak links in production, and further unleash production potential. The production volume increased by the five sugar factories due to the balanced equipment is equivalent to building a new mechanized sugar factory with a daily processing capacity of 1,100 tons of beets. Building such a large sugar factory requires an investment of more than 17 million yuan, while the cost of balancing the equipment of these five sugar factories is only more than 200,000 yuan.

    黑龙江五个糖厂平衡设备能力 
    ——投资二十多万元，增加的生产能力等于投资一千七百多万元建设的一个新厂——
    新华社哈尔滨20日电　黑龙江省五个甜菜制糖工厂，目前正在平衡设备能力。五个工厂平衡设备以后增加的生产能力，将等于新建一座每天加工甜菜一千一百吨的机械化新糖厂。
    红光、和平两个制糖厂把正在进行的加高渗出罐、增添蒸发罐等工程完成后，两厂的生产能力可以从每天处理甜菜一千吨提高到一千二百五十吨。阿城糖厂学习红光糖厂渗出工段“定时、定量、定质”的三定操作法，解决渗出工序生产力量小于其他工序的矛盾，生产能力可由现在的每天处理1，051吨甜菜提高到1，129吨。
    黑龙江省各糖厂，今年由于开展了先进生产者运动，工人的技术水平和劳动积极性都大大提高，各厂都发生了部分工序的生产能力被突破的情况。各厂目前进行的平衡设备能力的工作，就是为了适应这种新情况，改变生产的薄弱环节，进一步发挥生产潜力。五个糖厂由于平衡设备增加的生产量，等于新建一座日处理一千一百吨甜菜的机械化糖厂。新建这样大的糖厂需要投资一千七百多万元，而这五个糖厂平衡设备所用的费用只要二十多万元。
