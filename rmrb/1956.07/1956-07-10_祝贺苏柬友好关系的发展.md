　　Prince Norodom Sihanouk of the Kingdom of Cambodia, Prime Minister Khim Tit, and their entourage visited the Soviet Union at the invitation of the Soviet government, and a joint communique was issued on the 7th after talks with Soviet state leaders. The communique affirmed that relations between the two countries are based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, and the two countries decided to exchange diplomatic representatives at the ambassadorial level. The two countries will strengthen economic and cultural cooperation and specifically study the issue of Soviet assistance to the Kingdom of Cambodia's economic construction. Soviet state leaders also accepted the invitation to visit the Kingdom of Cambodia. This meeting laid a solid foundation for friendly cooperation between the Soviet Union and Cambodia.
　　Although the Soviet Union and Cambodia are geographically far apart, and their social systems are different, the Soviet Union has always sympathized with the Cambodian people's struggle to win and consolidate their independence, and has always attached importance to Cambodia's efforts to implement the Geneva Accords and pursue a policy of peace and neutrality. Now, the Soviet Union has established friendly diplomatic relations with Cambodia and is willing to provide technical and economic assistance to Cambodia without attaching any selfish conditions and with full respect for Cambodia's autonomy, independence, and national dignity. This is another vivid example of the Soviet Union's consistent implementation of a peaceful foreign policy and its willingness to befriend all countries on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. This policy of the Soviet Union will have an increasingly profound impact on international affairs and will increasingly isolate those forces that attempt to manipulate the fate of other countries by means of bullying the weak.
　　The success of the Soviet-Cambodian talks is also another positive result of Cambodia's implementation of a policy of consolidating peace and independence with a firm and courageous spirit. The policy of neutrality adhered to by the Royal Government of Cambodia and Prince Sihanouk has earned Cambodia the respect of many major countries in the world and has enabled Cambodia to play an increasingly important role in the cause of maintaining world peace. Cambodia's international status has been significantly improved, and it has more and more friends in the world. Relying on the selfless assistance of its friends and its own active efforts, Cambodia has a good opportunity to independently develop its economy. In this situation, some people who have ulterior motives towards Cambodia cannot help but be somewhat wary. There is an old Chinese saying: "Those who are virtuous receive much help." This is a true reflection of the international status of Cambodia, which pursues an independent policy today.
　　The Chinese people have always strived to maintain peace in Asia, hoping for the expansion of the spirit of friendly cooperation advocated by the Bandung Conference, and, just as we cherish our own national independence, we support the Asian countries that have recently taken control of their own destiny in consolidating their independence. Our country has already established friendly relations with Cambodia, and we wholeheartedly welcome the establishment of friendly relations between the Soviet Union and Cambodia, and sincerely congratulate the increasing consolidation and development of this relationship.

    祝贺苏柬友好关系的发展
    柬埔寨王国西哈努克亲王和首相钦·迪等一行应邀访问苏联，和苏联国家领导人举行会谈之后，在七日发表了联合公报。公报确定两国之间的关系以和平共处五项原则为基础，两国决定互派大使级的外交代表，两国将加强经济文化合作，并具体研究苏联援助柬埔寨王国经济建设的问题。苏联国家领导人并接受了访问柬埔寨王国的邀请。这次会谈，给苏、柬两国友好合作打下了巩固的基础。
    虽然苏联和柬埔寨在地理上相隔很远，两国的社会制度也不同，但是，苏联对于柬埔寨人民争取和巩固自己的独立的斗争一直是同情的，对于柬埔寨履行日内瓦协议和执行和平中立政策的努力一直是重视的。现在，苏联又和柬埔寨建立了友好的外交关系，并愿意在不附加任何利己的条件，充分尊重柬埔寨的自主、独立和民族尊严的情况下，向柬埔寨提供技术和经济援助。这是苏联始终不渝地执行和平外交政策、愿意在和平共处的五项原则的基础上同一切国家修好的又一个生动的例子。苏联的这种政策，将在国际事务中产生日益深远的影响，并将使那些企图用以强凌弱的手段来操纵其他国家的命运的势力日益陷于孤立。
    苏、柬会谈的成就，也是柬埔寨以坚定和勇敢的精神执行巩固和平和独立的政策所取得的又一个积极的结果。柬埔寨王国政府和西哈努克亲王所坚持的中立政策，使柬埔寨赢得了世界上许多大国的尊重，也使柬埔寨在维护世界和平的事业中发挥了越来越大的作用。柬埔寨的国际地位显著地提高了，它在世界上的朋友是越来越多了。依靠朋友们的无私援助和自己的积极努力，柬埔寨有着良好的机会独立地发展它的经济。在这种情况下，某些对柬埔寨别有企图的人，现在也不能不有所忌惮。中国有句古话说：“得道者多助。”这就是今天奉行独立政策的柬埔寨的国际地位的写照。
    中国人民一向为维护亚洲和平而努力，期望万隆会议所倡导的友好合作精神的扩大，并且如同珍视自己的国家独立一样，支持新近掌握了自己的命运的亚洲各国巩固它们的独立。我国和柬埔寨已经建立了友好的关系，我们衷心地欢迎苏柬两国友好关系的建立，并热诚地祝贺这种关系日益巩固和发展。
