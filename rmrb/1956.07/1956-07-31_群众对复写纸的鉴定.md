Public Appraisal of Carbon Paper

The "Renmin (People's) Brand" thin carbon paper produced by the local state-owned Shanghai Paper Products Reproduction Factory, and the "Guqian (Ancient Coin) Brand" carbon paper produced by the Shanghai Joint Private-Public Guanghui Stationery Factory, are both inexpensive and high-quality carbon papers. A box of "Guqian Brand" carbon paper retails for 4.5 yuan, which is 3 yuan cheaper than "Qunsheng Brand" carbon paper. The biggest characteristics of these two types of carbon paper are that they are smooth, non-stick, brightly colored, thin, and have even and abundant oil. In the past, when I used other brands of carbon paper to issue invoices, I could write a maximum of 20 to 25 copies, and the handwriting was unclear and it was very laborious. Now, with "Guqian Brand" carbon paper, I can write 35 to 42 copies on one sheet.

The "Qunsheng Brand" carbon paper produced by the Shanghai Qunsheng Industrial Cooperative and the "Daxiang (Elephant) Brand" carbon paper produced by the Tianjin Xin Dahua Industrial Factory are not only of low quality, but also very expensive, with a box of "Qunsheng" carbon paper costing 7.5 yuan. These two products are not only dull in color, thick, and have little and uneven oil, but also have lumps, and what is most annoying is that they stick to paper.

The "Qianmen (Front Gate) Brand" carbon paper produced by the Guangzhou Daxin Stationery Manufacturing Factory is of very good quality, with a rich and even color and strong adhesion. One sheet of carbon paper can be used more than ten times and the writing is still clear, which is equivalent to two or three sheets of other carbon paper, and the price is not expensive.

The "Fanchuan (Sailboat) Brand" carbon paper produced by the Shanghai Huazhong Factory has a light and uneven color and weak adhesion. After one copying, the color of the strokes peels off completely, and the writing becomes blurred and unclear after another copying. One sheet of carbon paper cannot be used after copying three or four times. Some even have unclear writing during the first copying. In addition, the "Xinyong (Credit) Brand" carbon paper produced by the Shanghai Synthetic Company Educational Supplies Factory and the "Luotuo (Camel) Brand" carbon paper produced by the Jinji Industrial Cooperative are also not good enough, and cannot be used after copying three or five times.

After finishing the pre-distribution work meeting in the county, I rushed to the supply and marketing cooperative to buy carbon paper. The salesman told me that the "Jianshe (Construction) Brand" carbon paper produced by the Beijing Carbon Paper United Mutual Aid Group was "cheap and good," so I bought a box. Who knew that this kind of carbon paper was of very poor quality. Wherever it was touched by hand or pressed by the arm, it became a big mess, and it was impossible to distinguish the details. Using this kind of carbon paper, our pre-distribution lists have become "pre-distribution confused lists."

### 群众对复写纸的鉴定

    群众对复写纸的鉴定
    地方国营上海纸品复制厂出品的“人民牌”薄型复写纸，上海公私合营光辉文具厂出品的“古钱牌”复写纸，都是价格低廉质量好的复写纸。一盒“古钱牌”复写纸零售四元五角，比群生牌复写纸便宜三元。这两种复写纸最大的特点是光滑，不粘纸，色泽鲜艳、纸地薄，油多而匀。我过去用其他牌子的复写纸开发票，顶多写二十到二十五份，字迹不清，还很吃力，现在用“古钱牌”复写纸，一张可以写三十五份到四十二份。
    上海群生工业社出品的“群生牌”复写纸、天津新大华实业工厂出品的“大象牌”复写纸，不但质量低，价格也很贵，一盒“群生”复写纸就要七元五角。这两种产品，不但色泽暗淡，纸地厚、油少，不匀，还有疙瘩，最使人讨厌的是还粘纸。

    广州大新文具制造厂出品的“前门牌”复写纸质量很好，颜色浓而匀，粘性强，一张复写纸用十多次写出字来还很清楚，可以顶两三张复写纸用，价格也不贵。
    上海华中工厂出品的“帆船牌”复写纸，颜色淡薄而不均匀，粘性不强。复写一次之后，有笔划的地方颜色全部剥落，再写一次字迹就模糊不清晰，一张复写纸复写三、四次就不能用了。有的甚至在第一次复写时字迹就不清晰。还有上海合成公司文教用品工厂生产的“信用牌”复写纸、金鸡工业社出品的“骆驼牌”复写纸也都不够好，复写三、五次就不能再用了。

    在县里开完预分工作会议，我就赶到供销社去买复写纸，营业员告诉我北京复写纸联合互助组出品的“建设牌”复写纸“价廉物美”，我就买了一盒。谁知这种复写纸质量很不好，凡是用手摸和用臂压的地方都成了大花脸，分不清眉目。用了这种复写纸，我们的预分清单都成了“预分混单”。
