Design and Manufacture More and Better New Products!
    155 New Woolen Fabrics Are About to Be Mass Produced
    (Our newspaper reports) One hundred and fifty-five new woolen fabrics will soon be mass-produced. This was decided at the National Wool Textile New Products Appraisal Meeting held in Beijing from June 25th to 29th.
    Although China's wool textile industry has a history of eighty years, it is unprecedented to mass-produce more than one hundred and fifty new varieties in the same period.
    These new products were designed by designers and workers in wool textile factories across the country after studying consumers' preferences. Among them are single-sided serge made of rayon and wool silk suitable for spring and autumn wear, high-grade gabardine, striped fancy worsted, and inexpensive overcoating made of camel hair embryos. What is particularly interesting is the embossed overcoating; this kind of fabric used to be imported, but it has now been successfully trial-produced at the Tianjin Renli Wool Textile Factory. There are also several light-colored yarns suitable for girls, which are new products trial-produced by the Shanghai Huafeng Wool Textile Factory, including three-strand, six-strand, and four-strand double-silk yarns; there are yarns that look like chains, and there are also pearl-like yarns that look like strings of pearls. Although some of the raw materials for these yarns are artificial wool, the shortcomings of general artificial wool have been overcome by using the ply method.
    At the meeting, nine wool textile factories that had achieved outstanding results in trial-producing new products were commended and rewarded. They are: State-owned Shanghai No. 1 and No. 2 Wool Textile Factories, State-owned Harbin Woolen Mill, Shanghai Joint State-Private Yuanfeng Wool Textile Factory, Xiexin Wool Textile Factory, Huafeng Wool Textile Factory, Tianxiang Camel Hair Factory, Tianjin Renli Wool Textile Factory, and Yinchuan Woolen Mill.

    设计和制造更多更好的新产品！
    一百五十五种新的毛织品即将大量生产
    本报讯　一百五十五种新的毛织品不久就可以大量生产了。这是六月二十五日到二十九日在北京召开的全国毛纺织新品种评选会议决定的。
    我国毛纺织工业虽然已有八十年的历史，但是在同一时期内大量生产一百五十多种新品种，还是空前的。
    这些新产品是全国毛纺织厂设计人员和职工研究了消费者的爱好以后设计出来的。其中有适合春秋季穿的人造丝和毛丝合股的单面呢，有高级华达呢、条子凡立丁，也有利用驼绒坯子制成的廉价大衣呢。特别使人感到兴趣的是拷花大衣呢，这种呢子过去都是进口的，现在已经在天津仁立毛纺厂试制成功。还有几种适合姑娘们用的各种浅色的绒线，是上海华丰毛纺厂试制的新产品，其中有三股的，六股的，四根双丝合股的绒线；有像锁链似的绒线，也有像一颗颗珍珠串在一起的珍珠式的绒线。这种绒线的原料，虽然有的是人造毛的，可是采用合股的办法以后，已经克服了一般人造毛的缺点。
    在这次会议上，九个试制新产品成绩优异的毛纺织厂受到表扬和奖励。它们是：国营上海第一、第二毛纺织厂，国营哈尔滨毛织厂，上海公私合营元丰毛纺厂、协新毛纺厂、华丰毛纺厂、天翔驼绒厂、天津仁立毛纺厂和银川毛纺厂。
