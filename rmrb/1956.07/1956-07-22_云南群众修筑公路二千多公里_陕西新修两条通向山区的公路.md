    Yunnan Masses Build Over 2,000 Kilometers of Highways
    Shaanxi Builds Two New Highways to Mountainous Areas

    (Our newspaper's dispatch from Kunming) Since the upsurge of rural collectivization last autumn, the masses in Yunnan Province have built 114 highways, totaling over 2,000 kilometers. Yunnan Province has a complex terrain and transportation is difficult. For example, Xinping County alone has more than 50 million *jin* of "dead-end grain" that cannot be transported out, while industrial products and new-style farm tools cannot be transported in. Therefore, the masses have an urgent need for road construction. Before the spring plowing, the masses in Wuding County spent only eight days building a 14-kilometer highway. In the construction of highways, people of all ethnic groups helped each other and demonstrated a high degree of enthusiasm and creativity. The 8-kilometer highway from Shaopo to Longshu was originally planned to be completed in 20 days with 2,500 people per day. As a result, it was completed in only 13 days with less than 1,300 people per day. In the past, transportation in Yunnan Province was underdeveloped. In 1950, only 35.1% of the province's counties and cities were accessible by road. Now, 74% of the counties and cities are accessible. By the end of this year, it is planned that 77.7% of the counties and cities will be accessible.

    (Our newspaper's dispatch from Xi'an) Shaanxi Province has begun constructing two new highways to mountainous areas. One is the highway from Yanchang County to Madouguan, and the other is the highway from Guozhen in Baoji to Taibai District.

    After the Yan-Ma Highway opens to traffic, it can connect to Daning County in Shanxi Province in the east, and converge with the Yan'an-Yulin Highway in the west. In the past, agricultural products from this mountainous area could not be transported out, but now they will be sold well. Various production and daily necessities will be transported in continuously.

    Taibai District originally had only a packhorse road to Guozhen in Baoji. In rainy weather, both manual and animal-powered transportation had to be stopped. The inconvenience of transportation seriously affected the lives of the people in the mountainous area. After the highway from Taibai District to Guozhen in Baoji is completed, it will play a significant role in meeting the production and living needs of the people in the mountainous area.

    云南群众修筑公路二千多公里
    陕西新修两条通向山区的公路
    本报昆明电　云南省自去年秋天农村合作化高潮以来，群众修筑的公路已经有一百一十四条，计二千多公里。云南省地形复杂，运输困难，如单是新平县就有运不出来的“死角粮”五千多万斤，而工业品和新式农具又运不进去。所以群众对修筑公路的要求很迫切。武定县群众在春耕前，只用八天时间，就修好了一条十四公里的公路。在修筑公路中，各族民工互相帮助，发挥了高度的积极性和创造性。哨坡到龙树的一条八公里的公路，原来计划每天二千五百人，二十天修好。结果每天不到一千三百人，只十三天就完成了。云南省过去交通不发达，在1950年通车的县市只占全省县市总数的35.1％。现在已经有74％的县市通车了。到今年年底，计划通车的县市将达到77.7％。
    本报西安电　陕西省又开始修建两条通向山区的公路。一条是延长县到马斗关的公路，一条是由宝鸡虢镇到太白区的公路。
    延马公路通车以后，东面可以连接山西省大宁县，西面可以到延安和咸榆公路汇合。这个山区过去无法外运的农产品，将会得到畅销。各种生产和生活用品将源源运入。
    太白区原来只有一条驮马路通向宝鸡虢镇，碰到天雨，人力和畜力的运输也不得不停止。交通运输的不便，严重地影响了山区人民的生活。太白区到宝鸡虢镇这条公路修通后，对于满足山区人民的生产和生活需要将起很大的作用。
