Xinhua News Agency, London, 5th: The Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference re-discussed the relations between the Commonwealth and the Soviet Union on the afternoon of the 4th.

According to the United Press, Indian Prime Minister Nehru explained in detail at the meeting that the correct attitude should be adopted towards the Soviet Union, and there was no need to be afraid of coexisting with the Soviet Union.

British Prime Minister Eden told the meeting that a Soviet trade delegation would visit Britain soon to discuss the possibility of expanding Anglo-Soviet trade.

Eden said that the Soviet Union has begun to pay attention to export production. The Commonwealth should work together to deal with this "economic challenge."

Pakistani Prime Minister Ali agreed with Eden's views on how to deal with "competitive coexistence."

The Prime Minister of Ceylon emphasized that the Commonwealth should develop into a "third force" and act as an intermediary between the United States and the Soviet Union.

Australian Prime Minister Menzies and Canadian Prime Minister St. Laurent believe that the Commonwealth should fully inform the United States and other allies of its assessment of the international situation before changing its "defense" policy.

South African Prime Minister Strydom believes that the Commonwealth should not only consider the policies of the Soviet Union, but also measure the internal changes in its own member states.

The morning session on the 4th discussed the expansion of the scope of Commonwealth membership and the peaceful use of nuclear energy.

Indian Prime Minister Nehru suggested that British colonies should automatically have the right to become formal and equal members of the Commonwealth once they have full control over their internal affairs and foreign affairs.

Ceylon Prime Minister Bandaranaike told the meeting that Ceylon intends to become a republic "at an appropriate time" but remain within the Commonwealth.
