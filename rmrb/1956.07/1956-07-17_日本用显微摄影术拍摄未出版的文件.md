Japan Uses Microphotography to Photograph Unpublished Documents

Under the sponsorship of the International Science Association, the Japan Academy of Sciences has begun using microphotography to photograph unpublished documents related to Japanese affairs scattered in archives throughout Europe. Professor Iwao Seiichi of Japan has already photographed Japanese documents in the Netherlands and other places. In London, Iwao is also photographing unpublished Japanese documents held in the Public Record Office, the Department of Manuscripts of the British Museum, and other places. A batch of documents from the early 17th century belonging to the Japan Department of the East India Company has been photographed.
