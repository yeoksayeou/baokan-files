    Bricks and Tiles Head South, Bricks and Tiles Head North
    ——Irrational Transportation Should Be Eliminated
    I am a freight planning worker at the Xuzhou Railway Sub-bureau. Here, the counterflow and excessively long-distance transport of bricks and tiles are very serious. For example, the Shandong Provincial Construction Company Supply and Marketing Department transported 32 truckloads of bricks from Xuecheng to Hefei; meanwhile, the Xinhailian City Construction Company transported 30 truckloads of bricks from Su County to Lianyungang, Xinpu, and other places, creating a 74-kilometer counterflow transportation between Xuzhou and Su County. In June, the Xuzhou Railway Sub-bureau wasted 344,587 ton-kilometers of transport capacity due to counterflow transportation, and the consigning units also paid more than 3,700 yuan in extra freight.
    I believe that the irrational transportation of bricks and tiles is mainly due to the decentralized management of production units, and the lack of a unified and centralized management organization by the state. Therefore, when the production of bricks and tiles appears to be in short supply, buyers rush to purchase them from all over, regardless of distance; the railway department also fails to analyze whether the consignment plan is reasonable, nor does it reflect the unreasonable situation to the local government.
    In order for the state to allocate building materials in a planned manner and to implement the principle of obtaining materials locally as much as possible, I suggest that a unified organization be established nationwide to manage the supply of bricks and tiles, with branches set up in various places. Through unified sales, it can be guaranteed that bricks and tiles are supplied locally as much as possible. Secondly, the State Planning Commission or the Provincial Planning Commission should stipulate the national or regional transportation scope of bricks and tiles. When the railway department reviews the consignment plan, if it finds any violations of this regulation, it will not approve it. In this way, the phenomenon of wasting transportation capacity and state wealth can be gradually corrected. (Li Shiwu)

### 南下是砖瓦，北上也是砖瓦——不合理的运输应该消除

    南下是砖瓦，北上也是砖瓦
    ——不合理的运输应该消除
    我是徐州铁路分局的货运计划工作人员。我们这里砖瓦的对流和过远运输很是严重。如山东省生建公司供销处由薛城运三十二车砖到合肥；新海连市建筑公司却从宿县运三十车砖到连云港、新浦等地，在徐州宿县间造成了七十四公里的对流运输。六月份徐州铁路分局由于对流运输浪费了运输力三十四万四千五百八十七吨公里，托运单位也支出了额外运费三千七百多元。
    我认为砖瓦运输不合理主要是生产单位分散经营，国家又没有统一集中的管理机构，因此，当砖瓦生产显得供不应求时，买者即不问远近，四处抢购；铁路部门也没有分析托运计划是否合理，也没有把不合理的情况反映给当地政府。
    为了使国家能有计划地分配建筑材料，并尽量贯彻就地取材的方针，我建议全国设立一个统一管理砖瓦供应的机构，各地分设分支机构，通过统一销售，就能保证砖瓦尽可能由当地供应。其次，由国家计划委员会或省计划委员会规定全国或地区性的砖瓦运输范围，铁路部门在审核托运计划的时候如发现有违反这个规定的就不予批准。这样，浪费运输力和国家财富的现象就可以逐渐得到纠正。（李世武）
