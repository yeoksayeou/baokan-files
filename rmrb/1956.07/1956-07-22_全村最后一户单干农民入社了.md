    The Last Individual Farmer in the Village Joins the Cooperative
    Lian Wenwu
    With the early rice and lychee crops both yielding bumper harvests, everyone on both sides of the Jiulong River is invigorated. Now, I want to tell you about a new development in an ordinary village on the banks of the Jiulong River – Changfu Village, Jiuhu Township – that is, the last individual farmer in the whole village has joined the advanced cooperative during the summer harvest.
    This individual farmer is named Zhu Wenzhang, and he is a lower-middle peasant. He believed that he had thirteen good lychee trees, which could yield 1,600 jin of lychees each year; more than fifty mandarin orange trees, which could yield more than 1,300 jin of mandarin oranges a year; and nine fen of good paddy fields, which could yield about 1,000 jin of grain each year. His family of five had two laborers, farm tools, and an ox. They had no shortage of food, supplies, or money, so why should he care about cooperation? During the high tide of cooperation last year, more than 440 farmers in the village joined the cooperative, but he still refused to join.
    The summer harvest season arrived. The Pioneer Cooperative's lychee trees were laden with fruit and ready to be picked, and the harvesting of the abundant rice crop also began. The cooperative formulated a preliminary distribution plan, estimating that the early rice harvest would be 2.5 million jin, an increase of one and a half times compared to last year's disaster-stricken and reduced yield (now most of the harvest is complete, and the whole cooperative can harvest more than 2.7 million jin); the lychee harvest could be more than 4 million jin, worth more than 300,000 yuan, an increase of one time compared to last year. It was estimated that each labor day in the early season would be worth 1.4 yuan. He also saw that the "Monkey Exploring Well" reservoir, which had never been built in previous dynasties, was completed this year by the advanced cooperative. As a result, the 1,035 mu of land that had suffered from drought and crop failure last year yielded a bumper harvest of more than 500 jin per mu. He also knew that Zhu Quitou, whose labor force was weaker than his, also had a family of five and used to have a worse life than him, could get 140 yuan in the early season this year. And what about himself? During the early season, his wife and children were sick for two months, and he couldn't manage the farming, so he didn't plant seedlings in his nine fen of good paddy fields. Later, the agricultural cooperative provided waterwheels, oxen, and labor to help him plant sweet potatoes, which could only yield a few hundred jin of dried sweet potatoes. As for the lychees, because the weeding work was not done well, the lychees he harvested could only be sold for more than 30 yuan. The income of the cooperative members with the same labor force as him was more than double his.
    The facts moved Zhu Wenzhang's heart. He consulted with his nephew Zhu Aishi, who had already joined the cooperative, and asked him in detail about the situation after joining the cooperative. He successively approached the director of the cooperative and the secretary of the Party branch and applied to join the advanced cooperative. His action immediately received a warm welcome from the cooperative members, and he was approved to join the cooperative. On June 21st, the first day that the Pioneer Cooperative used sickles to harvest rice, Zhu Wenzhang and his wife participated in the cooperative's rice harvesting. While the stars were still shining, they ate breakfast and went to the fields with the other cooperative members. The old cooperative members were very kind to them, some told him about the cooperative's rules, and some told him about this year's bumper harvest. The rice harvested that day was very good, yielding more than 500 jin per mu, and Zhu Wenzhang became more and more energetic as he harvested. On this day, Zhu Wenzhang earned eight and a half work points, and his wife earned six work points, and they felt it was very fair and reasonable. From then on, his wife sent the youngest child to the cooperative's seasonal nursery every morning and went to participate in the summer harvest herself; in the evening, she would take the child, who was well cared for in the nursery, back home. In the past half month, Zhu Wenzhang and his wife have participated in rice harvesting, lychee picking, weeding, and water wheeling, and have already earned more than one hundred work points. Because he didn't plant seedlings in the paddy fields in the early season, he is now short of grain. In order to take care of him, the agricultural cooperative treated him the same as the old cooperative members and temporarily distributed 75 jin of grain to each person. His family was extremely happy. His wife said: "Now we don't have to carry sacks to Zhangzhou to buy rice anymore. We have only tasted the sweetness of cooperation for half a month."

    全村最后一户单干农民入社了
    连文伍
    早稻、荔枝齐告丰收，九龙江两岸人人振奋。现在我要告诉大家的，是九龙江畔普通一村——九湖乡长福村出现的一件新事情，那就是全村最后一户单干农民在夏收中加入了高级社。
    这个单干农民名叫朱文章，是个下中农。他认为：自己有十三株好荔枝树，每年能收荔枝一千六百斤，五十多株柑子树，一年也能收柑子一千三百多斤，还有九分好水田，每年能收一千斤左右的粮食；一家五口人，两个劳力，有农具、有耕牛，吃、用、花三不缺，还管什么合作化不合作化呢？去年合作化高潮中，全村四百四十多户农民都入社了，而他还是拒绝入社。
    夏收季节来到了，先锋社果实累累的荔枝开始采摘了，丰硕的水稻的收割工作也开始了。社里订出预分方案，预计早稻要收二百五十万斤，比受灾减产的去年增产一倍半（现在大部分收割完了，全社可收二百七十多万斤）；荔枝可收四百多万斤，值三十多万元，比去年增加一倍。早季每个劳动日可预分一元四角。他还看到，历代历朝修不起来的“猴探井”水库，今年高级社把它修好了，一千零三十五亩去年受旱绝收的田，因此得到了每亩五百多斤的大丰收。他又知道，劳力比自己弱的朱欺头，一家也是五口人，过去生活比自己差，今年早季可分到一百四十元。而自己呢？早季时老婆、孩子病了两个月，耕种不过来，九分好水田没有插上秧，后来还是农业社拿出水车、耕牛和劳力，帮助他种上了番薯，只能收几百斤番薯干。至于荔枝，因为除草工作没做好，收的荔枝也只能卖到三十多元。社里和他同等劳力的社员的收入都比他多一倍还多。
    事实打动了朱文章的心，他找已经入社的侄儿朱爱食商量，详细问了入社以后的情况。他先后找了社主任、党支部书记，申请参加高级社。他的行动立即受到社员们满腔热情的欢迎，他被批准入社了。六月二十一日，先锋社动镰割稻的第一天，朱文章夫妻就参加社里割稻了。星星还亮着，他俩就吃了早饭，同别的社员一道到田里去。老社员对他们很亲切，有的告诉他社内的制度，有的告诉他今年丰收的情形。这一天割的稻子都很好，每亩能打五百多斤，朱文章越割越有劲。这一天，朱文章得了八分半工，他妻子得了六分工，他们感到很公平合理。从此以后，他的妻子在每天早晨就把最小的孩子送到社里的农忙托儿所，自己去参加夏收；晚上，再把在托儿所里照顾得挺好的孩子领回家。半个月来，朱文章夫妻参加割稻、摘荔枝、锄草、车水，已经得了一百多个工分。由于水田早季没有插上秧，他现在已经缺粮了。农业社为了照顾他，对他同老社员一样看待，每口人暂分给七十五斤谷子。他一家人高兴极了。他的妻子说：“现在不用拿着麻袋上漳州买大米了。入社只半个月，就尝到了合作化的甜头。”（原载福建日报）
