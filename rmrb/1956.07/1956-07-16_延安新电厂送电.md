Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, July 15th: A newly built thermal power plant in Yan'an officially went live on the 14th. That evening, men, women, old and young throughout the city came out to enjoy the first brightly lit weekend. Many stores welcomed customers under the bright electric lights; several entertainment venues were filled with the glow of electric lights, where hundreds and thousands of people watched plays and danced. Until late at night, people lingered on the city walls, gazing at the night view. The former site of the Eighth Route Army General Headquarters – the dense forest of Wangjiaping – revealed twinkling lights. The lights and figures on the slopes of Qingliang Mountain were reflected in the calm Yan River, creating a beautiful picture.

Yan'an had no power plant in the past. After the national liberation, the State Council decided to build a thermal power plant in Yan'an to provide electricity for local people's lighting. Construction of the power plant began in September 1955 and was officially completed by the end of June this year.

    延安新电厂送电
    新华社延安15日电　在延安新建的一座火力发电厂十四日正式送电。当晚，全市男女老幼都出来消度这第一个灯火辉煌的周末。许多商店都在雪亮的电灯下接待顾客；几处娱乐场所也充满了电灯的光亮，成百成千的人在那里观剧、跳舞。直到深夜，还有人流恋城头眺望夜景。原八路军总司令部住址——王家坪茂密的林子里，透露着点点灯火。清凉山山坡上的灯光人影，倒映在平静的延河里，构成一幅美丽的图画。
    延安过去没有发电厂。全国解放以后，国务院决定在延安建立一座火力发电厂，专供当地人民照明用电。这座电厂从1955年9月动工，到今年六月底正式建成。
