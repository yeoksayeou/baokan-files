    Lu Xun Museum Under Construction

    (Our Newspaper) The structural engineering of the exhibition hall of the newly built Lu Xun Museum in the capital has been completed. Interior painting and decoration are now underway. The design drawing for courtyard landscaping is being designed by the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Parks and Woods. A twelve-meter-wide road directly connecting the museum to Fuchengmen Street will soon begin construction.

    The Lu Xun Museum Preparatory Office has now collected many of Mr. Lu Xun's manuscripts and life photos, as well as valuable items such as magazines he edited during his lifetime. Models of Lu Xun's former residence in Shaoxing, the Anqiao Village home of Lu Xun's maternal grandmother, Lu Xun's former residence in Beijing, and the surrounding environment of Lu Xun's former residence in Beijing are also being produced. Famous Beijing artists will also create oil paintings and prints about Lu Xun's life for the museum.
