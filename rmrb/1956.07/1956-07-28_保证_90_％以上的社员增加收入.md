Xinhua News Agency, Baoding, July 26th: In the summer harvest distribution, most agricultural cooperatives in Hebei Province have seen increased incomes for their members.

**Most Agricultural Cooperatives in Hebei Province See Increased Incomes for Members**
**Tea Production Cooperatives in Southern Anhui See Increased Incomes for Over 90% of Members**

The summer harvest distribution work in agricultural cooperatives in Hebei Province has basically concluded. In the vast majority of cooperatives, over 90% of members have seen increased incomes.

According to a survey of over 6,000 cooperatives in the six special districts of Handan, Xingtai, Baoding, Tongxian, Tangshan, and Cangxian, over 5,000 cooperatives, accounting for 81% of the total, saw increased incomes for over 90% of their members. Among the cooperative members with increased incomes, most earned 10% to 20% more wheat than last year, with some earning as much as 50% or even several times more. In cooperatives where fewer than 90% of members saw increased incomes, some experienced reduced wheat fields, while others suffered reduced yields due to disasters. Additionally, in some joint township and village cooperatives, during the unified distribution of wheat, villages with originally high yields and large wheat fields saw a portion of their wheat transferred out, resulting in fewer than 90% of members seeing increased incomes. However, most members received a significant amount of wheat. In the 140+ cooperatives in Handan County, the 2,300+ households facing labor shortages and difficulties received assistance from the cooperatives, ensuring they had enough wheat to last until the autumn harvest.

To strive for increased incomes for over 90% of cooperative members, over half of the cooperatives in the province revised their originally excessively high and large financial expenditure and non-production labor plans before the wheat harvest. Fifty percent of the cooperatives implemented financial contract systems, overcoming extravagance and waste within the cooperatives. Agricultural cooperatives in various regions also strengthened the late-stage management of wheat fields. Therefore, although over 30 million mu of wheat in the province suffered some losses due to heavy rains during harvesting, a record bumper harvest was still achieved, guaranteeing increased incomes for cooperative members.

Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, July 26th: In the preliminary distribution of spring and summer tea income, over 90% of members in tea-growing cooperatives in the mountainous areas of southern Anhui Province saw increased incomes compared to last year, generally by 20% to 30%, with some increasing by more than half.

In the preliminary distribution of spring tea income, members of the Xinmin Tea Production Cooperative in Xin'an Township, Qimen County, received a preliminary distribution of 100 to 300 yuan per household, with 95% of members seeing an increase of half their income compared to the same period last year. Wang Peifen, a member of the well-known tea production cooperative in Kouchi Township, this county, earned 126 yuan for the entire year last year. This year, in the pre-distribution of the summer harvest, her income increased by more than 50 yuan compared to her total income last year.

This year, the total output of spring and summer tea in the tea-growing areas of southern Anhui Province increased by approximately 25% or more compared to last year. The state's purchase price for tea has also increased compared to last year. According to statistics from the Anhui Provincial Agricultural Products Purchasing Bureau, to date, farmers in tea-growing areas have seen an increase of over 6 million yuan in income from tea sales alone, due to increased tea production and the state's increased tea prices, compared to the same period last year.

**Agricultural Cooperatives in Hubei Province Prepare for Autumn Harvest Distribution Work**

Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, July 26th: Agricultural cooperatives in Hubei Province have begun preparing for autumn harvest distribution work. Since mid-July, Xiangyang Special District has started pilot autumn harvest distribution work in 19 agricultural cooperatives. The pilot autumn harvest distribution work carried out in 28 agricultural cooperatives in Huanggang Special District has largely resulted in the formulation of autumn harvest distribution plans.

During the pilot distribution, various regions have universally implemented policies of deducting less and distributing more, paying according to labor, and rewarding more labor with more pay. At the same time, appropriate solutions have been provided for living subsidies for elderly, weak, widowed, and disabled cooperative members, as well as subsidies for cooperative cadres whose participation in field labor is affected by official duties.

Many places have dispatched a large number of accounting instructors and accountants to go to the countryside to help production cooperatives clear financial accounting books.

**Prepaying a Portion of Cash to Cooperative Members Monthly Based on Needs and Possibilities**

Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, July 26th: The Huangjueping Agricultural Production Cooperative in Nongsheng Township, Yibin City, Sichuan Province, has been prepaying cash to cooperative members every month for the past three months based on needs and possibilities. According to the cadres of this cooperative: from May this year to now, cash has been prepaid three times, with a total amount of more than 5,800 yuan. The July prepayment was made in advance at the end of June, in order to ensure that cooperative members are prepared with daily necessities such as oil, salt, cigarettes, and alcohol before the autumn harvest and planting.

The pre-payment of cash to cooperative members is calculated according to the amount of labor points earned by individuals, distributed in proportion, with more labor earning more and less labor earning less, and deducted uniformly during the formal distribution after the autumn harvest. Therefore, everyone is very satisfied.

In the past, this cooperative only distributed twice a year, and members could not prepay, resulting in a lack of pocket money during normal times. In April this year, the cooperative's leadership, in order to solve this problem, in addition to actively helping members develop household sideline occupations, also considered that there were 21 public sideline occupations within the cooperative, including dairy farming and vegetable growing, which had fixed monthly income, and decided to adopt the method of prepaying cash to members several times.

### 保证90％以上的社员增加收入

    保证90％以上的社员增加收入
    在夏收分配中
    河北省绝大多数农业社社员增加收入
    皖南茶叶生产社90％以上的社员收入增多
    新华社保定26日电　河北省各地农业社的夏收分配工作基本结束，绝大多数社90％以上的社员都增加了收入。
    据邯郸、邢台、保定、通县、唐山、沧县六个专区对六千多个社的调查，90％以上社员增加收入的社就有五千多个，占总社数的81％。在增加收入的社员中，一般都比去年多收小麦10％到20％左右，多者达50％甚至几倍。没有达到90％的社员增加收入的社，有的是因为麦田减少，有的因为麦田遭灾减产；还有一些联乡、联村社在小麦统一分配中，原来产量高和麦田多的村因调出一部分小麦，增加收入的社员也没有达到社员总数的90％。但多数社员都分到许多麦子。邯郸县一百四十多个社里的二千三百多户缺劳力的困难户，经过社的照顾，分的小麦都能吃到秋收。
    为了争取90％以上的社员增加收入，麦收前这个省曾有半数以上的社修订了原来过高过大的财务开支和非生产用工计划；有50％的社推行了财务包干制度，克服了社内铺张浪费现象。各地农业社还加强了麦田的后期管理工作，因此，全省三千多万亩小麦虽因收割时雨多遭受部分损失，还是获得了空前的丰收，保证了社员增加收入。
    新华社合肥26日电　安徽省皖南山区种茶的合作社，在春夏茶收入的预分中，90％以上的社员比去年增加了收入，一般的增加20％到30％，有的增加一半以上。
    祁门县新安乡新民茶叶生产合作社，在春茶收入的预分中每户社员预分到一百元到三百元，其中95％的社员比去年同期增加了一半的收入。这个县?口乡驰名茶叶生产合作社社员汪配芬，去年全年收入一百二十六元，今年在午季预分中，他的收入比去年全年还增加五十多元。
    今年，安徽省皖南茶区的春夏茶总产量约比去年增加25％以上。国家收购茶叶的价格，也比去年有所提高。根据安徽省农产品采购厅的统计，到目前为止，茶区农民仅仅由于茶叶增产和国家提高了茶价，从出售茶叶中就比去年同期增加了六百多万元的收入。湖北省农业社准备秋收分配工作
    新华社武汉26日电　湖北省的农业社已经开始准备秋收分配工作。襄阳专区从七月中旬就先后在十九个农业社内着手进行秋收分配的试点工作。黄冈专区在二十八个农业社中进行的秋收分配试点工作，大部分已经制定出秋收分配方案。
    各地在试点分配中普遍贯彻了少扣多分、按劳计酬和多劳多得的政策。同时对孤寡老弱残疾社员生活补助和对社干因公影响参加田间劳动的补贴也作了适当的解决。
    许多地方派出了大批会计辅导员和会计员，下乡帮助生产合作社清理财务会计账目。
    根据需要和可能按月给社员预付一部分现金
    新华社成都26日电　四川省宜宾市农胜乡黄桷坪农业生产合作社根据需要和可能，最近三个月每月都预付现金给社员。据这个社的干部谈：从今年五月起到现在已经预付现金三次，金额共有五千八百多元。七月份的一次是在六月底提前预付的，这是为了使社员们在秋收秋种前都准备好油、盐、烟、酒等日常生活用品。
    社员预支现金，是根据本人劳动工分的多少，按比例计算，多劳多支，少劳少支，到秋收后正式分配时统一扣除。因此，大家都很满意。
    过去这个社一年只分两次，社员不能预支，以致平时缺少零花钱。今年四月，社的领导机构为了解决这一问题，除积极帮助社员发展家庭副业外，还考虑到社内有二十一项公共副业，其中养奶牛、种蔬菜等副业每月都有固定的收入，便决定采取给社员多预付几次现金的办法。
