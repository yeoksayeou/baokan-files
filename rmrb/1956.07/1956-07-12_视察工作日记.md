Inspection Work Diary
    Zheng Yun

    Editor's Note: The author of this article, Zheng Yun, is the Deputy Director of Teaching Affairs and Director of the Kindergarten at Beijing No. 2 Experimental Primary School, a representative of the Beijing Municipal People's Congress, a member of the Municipal People's Committee, and a member of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. This May, she inspected primary school education in Shanghai and other places, and recorded the situation and problems related to teaching in her diary. We are now publishing a part of her "Inspection Work Diary" here.
    May 18th, Friday
    Today, the inspection team held a meeting to study the issues related to the inspection work. All the representatives drafted inspection plans and made requests so that the reception office could make proper preparations.

    My inspection plan mainly focuses on primary school education and preschool education work. I plan to visit three or four primary schools and one or two kindergartens, and hold two symposiums to understand the problems of primary school teachers in their work, study, and life. In the remaining time, I would like to learn more about the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce in Shanghai, as well as cultural undertakings such as libraries and exhibition halls.
    May 19th, Saturday
    In the afternoon, a symposium for primary school teachers was held. Six or seven teachers attended the symposium. They unanimously reflected that in the implementation of the primary school teaching plan, the teaching tasks are heavy. In addition to having to concurrently implement the universal five-grade scoring system, they also have to learn standard Chinese and implement it in teaching. More importantly, primary school teachers must continuously study and improve, have sufficient time to prepare lessons, and improve teaching methods in order to improve the quality of education and complete teaching tasks well. However, teachers' afternoons (from Monday to Friday) are filled with learning and meetings. Saturday afternoon was originally scheduled as lesson preparation time, but the Culture and Education Bureau often arranges observation lessons or lectures. As a result, teachers have to revise homework and prepare lessons in the evening or on Sundays.

    If they are excellent teachers or advanced workers, they have even more meetings, concurrent jobs, and social activities. These teachers often sleep very late. Over time, this will have a bad impact on their health. Teachers reflect that "there are too many social activities, and there is no time for teaching." "We are not afraid of being busy, but the current situation is busy and fruitless."
    May 21st, Monday
    In the morning, I went to Luwan District No. 1 Central Primary School to visit, wanting to understand the issues of the first grade's pilot teaching of the new Chinese textbook and the fifth grade's pilot teaching of the history textbook. The school leaders and teachers accompanied me to listen to the first grade's Chinese and arithmetic classes. The young teacher, Lü Muqing, taught the Chinese lesson on "Selling Vegetables," a poetic genre. The teacher spoke standard Chinese very well, and it didn't feel unfamiliar at all, which shows that Shanghai's Chinese teachers are working very hard to learn standard Chinese. The content of the text is close to children's lives, and children can easily understand it, but the new characters representing the names of these vegetables are unfamiliar to the children. There are a total of thirteen new characters in the whole lesson. For the convenience of teaching, the teacher first taught eight new characters such as "selling chives, peppers, melons, scallions, garlic, and persimmons." The teaching was carried out in this way: the teacher used intuitive teaching aids—real objects and pictures of vegetables—to teach new characters, such as first writing the phonetic alphabet according to the name of each vegetable using the method of phonetic analysis and synthesis, then proposing new characters, analyzing the shapes of the characters, and combining observation of real objects to vividly explain the characteristics of various vegetables, and finally teaching the writing method, which took a long time. By the time of the writing practice, there was not much time left. In this lesson, the teacher's lesson preparation was very sufficient, the explanation was lively and vivid, and it was very successful in inspiring students' thinking and developing their language. However, there was not a minute of rest time in the forty-five minutes. The children used their brains to think, their ears to listen, their eyes to look, their hands to write, and their mouths to read, which is very tiring for children under the age of eight.

    According to the teacher, students have to learn an average of about a dozen new characters every day (a total of 641 new characters have to be learned in two semesters of the first grade), and the children feel extremely tired, which is detrimental to the physical and mental development of children.
    May 22nd, Tuesday
    Today, I listened to a lesson taught by teacher Mao Jiying at Xincheng District No. 1 Central Primary School. She was still teaching the "Selling Vegetables" lesson that was taught at Luwan District Primary School yesterday. Therefore, I had the opportunity to review it again. From the teaching, it can be seen that she is an experienced teacher. She omitted the repeated hanging of pictures for direct viewing, and only used real objects, and the "free time" was more.

    As soon as the class was over, teacher Mao Jiying said to me: "You listened to my class, and I really have a lot of burdens. On the one hand, I am afraid of not teaching well, and on the other hand, my Mandarin is not good, and I am worried about bringing out the dialect." I smiled and said to her: "The weight of this lesson is not light. In this lesson, you repeatedly helped the students consolidate the eight new characters in the text. Your Mandarin is very successful. I, a Beijinger, understood everything."

    On the way back, I thought: The teacher and students in this lesson were very nervous. To reduce the burden, the selection of teaching materials should be improved.
    May 23rd, Wednesday
    In the morning, I went to Shanghai No. 1 Normal School Affiliated Primary School to inspect. This primary school is a school that I have long heard of. With a learning attitude, I listened to another first-grade Chinese lesson and gained a deeper understanding of the problems in the Chinese textbook.

    Teacher Shi Huifang taught the lesson "Harvesting Wheat." The text is long, there are many characters, and it is very literary, so there are considerable difficulties in dealing with the teaching materials. The teacher fully used intuitive teaching aids and the principle of enlightenment when teaching. For example, she first took out wheat seedlings and asked the children what they were: "wheat"? Then pointing to the ears of wheat, she asked what they were? The children didn't know, so the teacher told them that they were called ears of wheat, and asked what color the wheat turns when it is ripe? The teacher naturally led to the explanation of the text. When talking about farmers harvesting wheat, the teacher hung up a picture of harvesting wheat. The children watched the picture while listening to the explanation of the Chinese lesson. The teacher also taught the eight new characters "穗 (sui, ear of grain), 接 (jie, connect), 望 (wang, look), 员 (yuan, person), 镰 (lian, sickle), 割 (ge, cut), 捆 (kun, bundle), 装 (zhuang, load)" in the order of the text. Her process of teaching literacy is first the sound of the character, then the new character is proposed, then the shape of the character is analyzed, and finally the writing of the character is taught. The time taken in this area is also very long, and the time for writing practice is short.

    I feel that the lesson "Harvesting Wheat" is much more difficult to teach than the lesson "Selling Vegetables." Some sentences in the text, such as "望不到头 (wang bu dao tou, cannot see the end)" and "在很远的地方接起来 (zai hen yuan de difang jie qilai, connecting in a very far place)," children of young age do not have this kind of imagination, and these sentences are difficult to understand. If the children ask: How can the blue sky and the wheat field be connected? It will take some time to explain.

    After class, I exchanged opinions with the teachers. They felt that the new first-grade textbook has long texts and many new characters. Because there are many new characters, the opportunities for repetition and practice are reduced, and it is difficult to consolidate. Some teachers said: Characters with many strokes do not need to require children to practice writing. However, if they are not familiar with the stroke order, it is difficult to remember firmly, and if they are not required to teach writing in the first grade, in which year will they teach them?

    视察工作日记
    郑芸
    编者按：本文作者郑芸是北京市第二实验小学的副教导主任兼幼儿园主任，北京市人民代表大会代表、市人民委员会委员，中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会委员。她在今年五月到上海等地视察了小学教育，在日记中记下了有关教学等方面的情况和问题。现在把她的“视察工作日记”一部分发表在这里。	五月十八日　星期五
    今天视察组开会研究了视察工作的问题。各位代表都拟定了视察计划，提出了要求，以便招待办事处妥为准备。
    我的视察计划主要放在小学教育和学前教育工作上，计划参观三四所小学和一两所幼儿园，召开两次座谈会，了解小学教师在工作、学习、生活当中的问题。剩余的时间，我想再了解上海市资本主义工商业社会主义改造的问题以及文化事业如图书馆、展览馆等方面的情况。	五月十九日　星期六
    下午举行了小学教师座谈会。参加座谈会的有六七位教师。他们一致反映，在贯彻执行小学教学计划当中，教学任务繁重，除去必须兼任普遍推行五级制记分法以外，还要学习标准语，并且要贯彻到教学当中去。更重要的是小学教师必须不断地学习提高，有充分时间备课，改进教学方法，才能提高教育质量，很好地完成教学任务。但是，教师们每周（从星期一到星期五）每天下午课后，都排满了学习和开会等活动。星期六下午半天原定是备课时间，但是文教科常常布置观摩教学或听报告。这样，教师们不得不把批改作业和备课工作，改在晚间或星期日去做了。
    如果是优秀教师或是先进工作者，会议、兼职、社会活动就更多了。这些教师经常睡的很晚。长此下去，对他们的身体健康会有很坏的影响。教师们反映“社会活动实在太多，没有时间搞教学了。”“我们不怕忙，但是目前的情况是忙乱而无收获。”	五月二十一日　星期一
    上午，到庐湾区一中心小学去参观，想了解一年级试教语文新课本和五年级试教历史课本的问题。学校的领导同志和教师陪同我听了一年级的语文课和算术课，讲课的是青年教师吕慕清，讲授的课文是“卖菜”，诗歌体裁。教师的标准语讲得很好，听来一点也不感到隔膜，这说明上海的语文教师在学习标准语方面是很努力的。课文内容接近儿童生活，孩子们容易了解，不过代表这些菜的名称的生字，孩子们是感到生疏的。全课共有十三个生字，教师为了教学便利，先讲了“卖韭、辣椒、瓜、葱、蒜、柿”等八个生字。教学是这样进行的，教师运用直观教具——菜的实物和图画，来教学生字，如先根据每种蔬菜的名称，用音的分析综合法写出注音字母，再提出生字，分析字形，并且结合观察实物，活生生地说出各种菜的特征，最后教写法，费去很长时间，到练习写的时候，时间已经不多了。这一节课，教师的备课很充分，讲解生动活泼，对启发学生的思维，发展学生的语言方面是很成功的。但是，在四十五分钟内没有一分钟的休息时间，孩子们用脑想、用耳听、用眼看、用手写、用口念，这对不满八岁的孩子们来说是很吃力的。
    据教师说，学生每天平均差不多要学十几个生字（在一年级两学期间共要学六百四十一个生字），孩子们感到极度疲劳，这样对于儿童的身心发育是不利的。	五月二十二日　星期二
    今天到新城区一中心小学听了毛季英教师讲的一堂课。她讲的教材还是昨天卢湾区小学讲的“卖菜”一课。因此，我有机会又温习了一次。从教学中看得出来她是一位有经验的教师。她省去了重复的挂图直观，只采用了实物，“空堂”的时间多。
    刚下课，毛季英老师对我说：“您听我的课，我真有很多负担，一方面怕教不好，另一方面我的普通话说不好，担心把方言带出来。”我笑着对她说：“这节课的分量是不轻的，您在这节课里，反复地帮助学生把课文的八个生字巩固了。您的普通话讲得很成功，我这个北京人全都听懂了。”
    在回来的路上，我想：这节课师生都是很紧张的，要想减轻负担，应当改进教材的编选工作。
          五月二十三日　星期三
    上午到上海第一师范附属小学去视察。这所小学是我久已闻名的学校，我抱着学习的态度，又听了一节一年级语文课，更深入地了解了语文课本中的问题。
    史慧芳教师讲的是“收麦”一课。课文长，字多，文艺性很强，在教材处理上是有相当困难的。教师讲课的时候充分运用了直观教具和启发原则。如她先拿出麦秧问孩子是什么“麦子”？又指着麦穗问是什么？孩子们不知道，老师便告诉他们叫麦穗，又问麦子熟了是什么颜色？教师很自然地引到正文的讲解上去了。讲农民收麦子的时候，老师就挂出收麦图。小朋友一面看着图，一面听着讲解语文课，教师也按照课文顺序教会了“穗、接、望、员、镰、割、捆、装”八个生字。她的教识字的过程是先字音，再提出生字，然后分析字形，最后教字的写法。在这方面占用的时间也很长，练习书写的时间少。
    我体会“收麦”这课书比“卖菜”那一课难讲的多，课文中有些句子如“望不到头”，“在很远的地方接起来”。年龄小的孩子是没有这种想像力的，这些句子是不好理解的。假如小同学问：蓝天和麦地怎会接起来呢？这样就要费些时间来讲解了。
    下课后，我和教师们交换了意见，他们觉得一年级新课本课文长，生字多。因为生字多，复现的机会和练习的机会就少，也难以巩固。有的教师说：笔画多的字，可以不要求孩子们练习书写。但是，不熟习笔顺，是难记得牢的，并且在一年级不要求教会书写，究竟在那一年内教他们呢？
                          （未完）
