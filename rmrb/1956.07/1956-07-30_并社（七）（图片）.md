	25. It turned out that Qiao Tianrui, the vice leader of the mutual aid team, had come in. The idea of ​​leaving only 3% of the public accumulation fund was his idea for Li Baichuan. Now, seeing that Li Baichuan was angry, he further provoked him with words.

	26. Li Baichuan was so angry that he shook his fist and gritted his teeth. Qiao Tianrui smiled and came up with another idea: he wanted Li Baichuan to hold a meeting of cooperative members, saying, "Our west side has more mutual aid teams than the east side, why can't we run an advanced cooperative ourselves!" As long as everyone shouts, it will be considered passed.

	27. At this time, Yinghua was walking home from the club. She wanted to talk to her father, which was so difficult! She still remembers that when she was thirteen, her mother made a sock too small and was beaten by her father so badly that she couldn't get out of bed for three days.

	28. Yinghua pushed the door open, and her father and Qiao Tianrui were both taken aback. Yinghua felt disgusted as soon as she saw Qiao Tianrui, who had worked in the police station of the puppet Manchukuo. When Qiao Tianrui saw her, he also hurriedly got up, smiled "hee hee hee hee", and left.

    25　进来的原来是乔天瑞，互助组的副组长。把公积金只留百分之三的主意就是他给李百川出的。现在一看李百川正恼火，就进一步用话来挑他。
    26　李百川气得晃着拳头，咬起牙来。乔天瑞笑着，又出了个主意：要李百川开个社员会，说“咱西头比东头多个互助组哩，为什么不能自办高级社！”只要大伙一嚷，就算通过了。
    27　这时，莺花正从俱乐部向家里走去。要跟爹谈谈，这多么不容易！她至今记得，十三岁上，妈做小了一只袜子，就被爹打得三天不能起炕。
    28　莺花推门进去，她爹和乔天瑞都吃了一惊。莺花一看见这个曾在伪满洲国的警察局做过事的乔天瑞，就觉得挺讨厌。乔天瑞看见她，也慌忙起身，“嘻嘻嘻嘻”笑着，走了。
