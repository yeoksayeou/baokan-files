    Increasing Soybean Yield and Quality
    Wang Shou
    China ranks first in the world in soybean production. With high output and excellent quality, the beans are uniform in size and beautiful in color, holding a very important position in the international market. However, in recent years, the increase in soybean production and quality in China has been very slow. According to international statistics from 1952, China's soybean yield per unit area still lags far behind Canada, the United States, and even Brazil and Japan. This is a phenomenon worth noting.
    This year, all parts of the country have planted soybeans according to plan, and many regions have adopted improved varieties and advanced technologies. Key producing areas such as Heilongjiang, Liaoning, and Shandong have selected certain agricultural cooperatives to conduct large-scale demonstration projects for high soybean yields. These will play a positive role in improving soybean production and quality.
    Currently, spring-sown soybeans are approaching the flowering season, and summer-sown soybeans are also in their peak growth period. This year, many areas have experienced more rainfall, and soybeans may be prone to excessive vegetative growth. The way to prevent this is to strengthen field management, carry out thinning, inter-tillage, and drainage.
    Topping soybeans is a good way to prevent excessive growth and lodging. According to a comparative survey conducted by the Jiutai Agricultural Experiment Station in Jilin Province in Jiutai County, topped soybeans not only inhibited excessive growth and prevented lodging but also had more branching, stronger plants, and better bean quality (reduced immature beans, increased hundred-grain weight). According to an experiment in the Lingnan Agricultural Production Cooperative in Jiangkou District, Guiping County, Guangxi Province, this year with early-maturing yellow soybeans, topping resulted in an approximate yield increase of one to two times compared to not topping. Farmers in some areas of Shandong Province also have experience with yield increases from topping. The timing for topping is generally during the peak flowering period for soybeans in Northeast China, and at the beginning of flowering in Shandong and Guangxi.
    In recent years, soybean pod borers have caused serious damage in soybean producing areas of Northeast China, and soybean worms have also caused significant losses in various parts of Shandong Province in recent years. Therefore, these areas must pay close attention to the occurrence of pests this year and make timely preparations for prevention and control.
    Soybeans require the most water during flowering and pod formation. If drought occurs, flower and pod drop will increase. Last year, most areas of Jilin Province experienced drought after August, reducing soybean production by about 20%. If areas with uneven rainfall distribution, especially those prone to drought in autumn, prepare for drought resistance and irrigate in a timely manner when drought occurs, soybean pod setting and grain filling can obtain the necessary moisture.
    After soybeans flower, it is inconvenient to cultivate and weed, and many large weeds often invade the nutritional space of the soybeans. Therefore, removing weeds from the field is very important. Farmers in many areas of Northeast China have always had the habit of pulling large weeds in soybean and millet fields, and this practice is worth promoting.

    提高大豆的产量和质量
    王绶
    我国大豆生产占世界第一位。出产量多，品质优良，豆粒整齐，色泽美观，在国际市场上一向占着极重要的地位。但是，近年来我国大豆的产量和质量都提高很慢。据1952年国际统计资料，我国大豆的单位面积产量还远远落在加拿大、美国，甚至巴西、日本的后面。这是值得注意的现象。
    今年全国各地大都按照计划播种了大豆，不少地区还采用了优良品种和先进技术。黑龙江、辽宁、山东等重点产区，都选定了一定的农业合作社进行大豆大面积丰产示范。这些对于提高大豆的产量和质量，都会起到积极作用。
    目前，春播大豆已接近开花时节，夏播的大豆也已到了生长旺期。今年许多地区雨水较多，大豆有贪青徒长的可能。防止的办法是：加强田间管理，进行间苗、中耕、排水。
    对大豆实行摘顶，是防止徒长倒伏的好办法。据吉林省九站农业试验站在九台县的对比调查：摘顶（又叫摘心）后的大豆，不但抑制了徒长、防止了倒伏，而且分枝多，植株健壮，豆粒质量也好（未熟粒减少，百粒重增加）。另据今年广西省桂平县江口区岭南农业生产合作社种植早黄豆的试验，实行摘顶的，比没有摘顶的大约增产一倍至二倍。山东省部分地区的农民，也有摘顶增产的经验。摘顶的时间，东北地区一般在大豆开花盛期，山东、广西在开花初期。
    近几年来，东北大豆产区的大豆食心虫为害很严重，山东省各地近年来受豆虫为害的损失也很大。因此，这些地方今年要密切注意虫害的发生，及时做好防治的准备。
    大豆开花结荚需要水分最多，若遇干旱，落花落荚便会增加。去年吉林省大部地区在八月以后遇到干旱，大豆减产约二成左右。雨量分布不均匀、特别是秋季容易发生干旱的地区，如果做好抗旱准备，遇到干旱，及时灌溉，大豆结荚灌浆就能得到必需的水分。
    大豆开花以后，由于中耕除草不便，田间常有许多大草侵占大豆的营养空间，因此拔除田间杂草就是很重要的事。东北许多地区的农民，一向有在大豆、谷子田中拔大草的习惯，这种作法值得提倡。
