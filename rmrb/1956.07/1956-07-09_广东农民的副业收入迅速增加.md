Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, July 7th. Sideline income for Guangdong farmers is rapidly increasing. According to incomplete statistics from only the Shaoguan, Gaoyao, and Foshan Special Zones, sideline production income for the past month alone reached 13.2 million yuan.

Starting in late May, various regions in Guangdong Province generally began to emphasize the development of sideline production and the implementation of diversified operations. Most agricultural cooperatives, based on the principles of low investment, quick results, and high returns, utilized the slack farming season before the summer harvest to rapidly launch temporary sideline production activities suited to local conditions. After the agricultural cooperatives in Chengmai County on Hainan Island organized a portion of their labor force to engage in diversified sideline activities such as bamboo and wood processing and fishing, the county's income reached more than 22,600 yuan in ten days.

Various localities are also actively developing the livestock breeding industry and beginning to pay attention to the sideline production of cooperative members' families. In the Huiyang Special Zone, by late June, the number of pigs raised by farmers had increased by 230,000 head, and the number of poultry had increased by nearly 2 million.

    广东农民的副业收入迅速增加
    新华社广州7日电　广东省农民的副业收入迅速增加。仅据韶关、高要和佛山等三个专区的不完全统计，近一个月的副业生产收入就有一千三百二十万元。
    从五月下旬起，广东省各地才开始普遍重视发展副业生产和开展多种经营，大部分农业社根据投资少、收效快和收益大的原则，利用夏收前的农闲时间，因地制宜迅速地展开了临时性的副业生产。海南岛的澄迈县各农业社组织一部分人力展开竹、木器加工和打鱼等多样化副业活动后，全县在十天内的收入达二万二千六百多元。
    各地还积极发展家畜饲养业和开始注意社员的家庭副业生产。惠阳专区的农民，到六月下旬养猪的数量增加了二十三万头，家禽增加了近二百万只。
