Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, July 5th. Xinhua News Agency reporter Wang Dian reports: Yunnan Province's ethnic work has entered a new stage. How to eliminate the backwardness historically left over from the minority nationalities and help them carry out socialist transformation and construction has become the fundamental task of the Party on ethnic issues. This was the unanimous understanding reached at the first Congress of the Communist Party of China in Yunnan Province, held in late June.

The Yunnan Provincial Party Congress comprehensively reviewed the Party's ethnic work over the past six years. The congress held that: Because the Provincial Party Committee and organizations at all levels correctly implemented the central government's guidelines, policies, and instructions, the Party has achieved significant victories in ethnic work. Now, in the inland rural areas that have completed land reform, agriculture in the minority nationality areas, inhabited either solely or jointly by four million people, has basically achieved semi-socialist cooperativization, with the number of households participating in advanced agricultural production cooperatives accounting for 30% of the total number of households. In the border ethnic areas, democratic reforms have been completed successively in areas with a population of 800,000 through peaceful consultation, and more than 1,000 key production cooperatives have been established. The reforms in the Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture and the Honghe Hani Autonomous Prefecture will also be completed this year. In the Lisu and Jingpo ethnic areas, where class differentiation is not yet obvious, pilot projects for directly establishing cooperatives have also begun. The Congress held that the development of socialist transformation and construction of various ethnic groups has given ethnic issues new content.

The Congress seriously criticized the current phenomenon of insufficient understanding of the new situation among some Party members, pointing out that: treating ethnic issues in socialist transformation in a general way, ignoring ethnic characteristics, and acting simplistically are contrary to the Party's guidelines; and clinging to outdated situations and views, or one-sidedly emphasizing the particularity of nationalities and thus ignoring the urgent desire of minority nationalities for socialism, and not daring to actively lead the people of all nationalities to realize their demands, are also erroneous ideas that are not conducive to the development of various nationalities.

The Congress held that: Only by helping minority nationalities complete socialist transformation and construction can the tasks of the Party and the state in the transition period on ethnic issues be fulfilled satisfactorily. After discussing the situation of various nationalities, the Congress unanimously agreed that: For the minority nationality areas in the plains and semi-mountainous areas with a population of about three million, it is necessary to affirm that the steps of agricultural cooperativization should be roughly the same as those of the Han nationality, complete the transition to advanced agricultural production cooperatives after this autumn, and consider economic and cultural development plans in a unified manner with the Han nationality; it is also necessary to fully take into account the characteristics of ethnic production and other aspects, provide special assistance to their difficulties and demands, and strive to reach a level equivalent to that of the Han nationality in the next seven years. For the minority nationalities living in high and cold mountainous areas with a population of about one million, because they still have great difficulties in production and life, and the current number of households joining cooperatives accounts for only 30% to 50% of the households in mountainous areas, more assistance should be given. Specific measures suitable to the specific circumstances should be formulated on the specific policies, speed, and steps of cooperativization, as well as other socialist measures, and the principle of "less exaction, more assistance, and fair prices" should be adopted to consolidate and improve the existing agricultural production cooperatives, vigorously develop agriculture and sideline production, implement free medical care, publicly run primary schools, meet supply at low prices in trade, reduce or exempt agricultural taxes and other taxes, relax the self-retention standards for grain unified purchase, and provide more loans and relief. Strive to complete cooperativization in the next one or two years, achieve enough to eat and wear, and basically change the backwardness of the nationalities in seven years. For areas that have completed democratic reforms in the border areas, according to the principle of "generally developing mutual aid teams, focusing on pilot cooperative societies, and vigorously developing production," increase agricultural and cash crop yields, increase people's income, and establish local medium and small-scale industries in a planned way, and complete the socialist transformation of agriculture in two or three years. For areas such as the Jingpo, Lisu, and Kawa ethnic groups with a population of nearly 700,000, under the strong support of the state, production should be developed through mutual assistance and cooperation, local economic and cultural centers should be established, and the transition to socialism should be gradually achieved.

The Congress held that: In order to help people of all nationalities give play to their enthusiasm, initiative, and creativity in socialist transformation and construction, it is necessary to continue to complete the ethnic regional autonomy of the entire province in the next two years, actively train ethnic cadres and develop Party organizations, help nationalities that do not yet have written languages create written languages, and improve the people's cultural level. In order to smoothly realize these tasks, it is necessary to continue to criticize the remnants of Han chauvinism among Han cadres, oppose "left" or right ideological tendencies in ethnic work, adhere to the mass line in ethnic work, and effectively help minority nationality cadres overcome local nationalism.

    云南民族工作发展到新阶段
    中共云南省代表大会根据各民族不同情况确定今后工作内容
    据新华社昆明5日电　新华社记者王甸报道：云南省的民族工作发展到了新的阶段。如何消灭少数民族历史上遗留下来的落后状态，帮助他们进行社会主义的改造和建设，已经成为当前党在民族问题方面的根本任务。这是六月下旬举行的中国共产党云南省第一次代表大会的一致认识。
    云南省党的代表大会全面地检查了六年来党的民族工作。大会认为：由于省委和各级组织正确地执行了中央的方针、政策和指示，使党在民族工作方面已经取得重大的胜利。现在，完成土地改革的内地农村中，四百万少数民族聚居或杂居地区的农业，已经基本上实现了半社会主义的合作化，参加高级农业生产合作社的农户已占总农户的30％。边疆民族聚居区，已有八十万人口的地区采用和平协商方式先后完成民主改革，并且重点建立了一千多个生产合作社。西双版纳傣族自治州和红河哈尼族自治地方的改革也将在今年完成。在阶级分化尚不明显的傈僳、景颇族地区，也开始直接办社的试点。代表大会认为：各民族的社会主义改造和建设的发展，使民族问题具有了新的内容。
    代表大会严肃地批判了目前在若干党员中存在的对新情况认识不足的现象，指出：一般化地对待社会主义改造中的民族问题，忽视民族特点，简单行事是与党的方针相违背的；而拘泥于陈旧的情况和观点，或片面强调民族的特殊性因而忽视少数民族对社会主义的迫切愿望，不敢积极地去领导各族人民实现要求，也是不利于各民族发展的错误思想。
    代表大会认为：只有帮助少数民族完成社会主义的改造和建设，才能圆满地实现过渡时期党和国家在民族问题方面的任务。大会在讨论了各民族的情况以后，一致认为：对于平原和半山区的约三百万人口的少数民族地区，既需肯定农业合作化的步骤应和汉族大体一致，在今秋以后完成转为高级农业生产合作社的工作，并在经济、文化发展规划上和汉族统一考虑；又须充分照顾到民族生产和其它方面的特点，对其困难与要求给予特殊的帮助，争取在今后七年内使他们达到和汉族相当的水平。对于居住在高寒山区的约一百万人口的少数民族，由于他们在生产和生活上还存在很大的困难，目前入社的农户还只占山区农户的30％到50％，因此应该给予更多的帮助。在合作化的具体政策、速度、步骤上，以及其它社会主义措施上，应制定适合具体情况的办法，采取一少（要的少）二多（给的多）三公道（价格公道）的方针，巩固和提高现有的农业生产合作社，大力发展农业、副业生产，实行免费医疗，公办小学，在贸易上以低廉的价格满足供应，减免农业税和其它税收，放宽粮食统购的自留标准，并给予更多的贷款、救济。争取在今后一、二年内完成合作化，达到够吃够穿，七年内基本上改变民族的落后面貌。对于边疆已经完成民主改革的地区，应根据“普遍发展互助组，重点试办合作社，大力发展生产”的方针，提高农业和经济作物产量，增加人民收入，并有计划地建立地方中、小型工业，在两三年内完成对农业的社会主义改造。对于约近七十万人口的景颇族、傈僳族、佧瓦族等地区，则应在国家大力扶助之下，通过互助合作发展生产，建立当地的经济、文化中心，逐步向社会主义过渡。
    代表大会认为：为了帮助各族人民在社会主义改造和建设中发挥积极性、主动性和创造性，必须继续在今明两年内完成全省的民族区域自治，并积极培养民族干部和发展党的组织，帮助还没有文字的民族创造文字，提高人民的文化水平。为了这些任务的顺利实现，必须继续批判汉族干部中的大民族主义思想残余，反对民族工作中“左”或右的思想倾向，坚持在民族工作中的群众路线，并有效地帮助少数民族干部克服地方民族主义思想。
