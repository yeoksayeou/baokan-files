Xinhua News Agency, July 1st: A type of foam cement mixed with waste coal fly ash has begun to be used on construction sites in the capital. The roof panels of the newly completed Central Institute for Nationalities' Arts Building were irrigated with this cement. A total of over 20,000 *jin* of silicate cement was saved in this building. The cost of foam cement mixed with fly ash is 10.80 yuan per cubic meter lower than that of silicate cement.

The Beijing Sixth Construction Engineering Company plans to start using this cement in mid-July for small prefabricated components such as lintels, ditch covers, road blocks, and lightweight partition walls. This company plans to save the state 37,500 kilograms of silicate cement in the second half of this year.

This new type of cement was successfully trial-produced by the Construction Technology Research Institute of the Beijing Municipal Construction Engineering Bureau.

    北京市建筑工程局使用烟灰配成水泥
    新华社1日讯　首都的建筑工地上，开始使用一种用废煤烟灰配成的泡沫水泥。新近落成的中央民族学院文艺楼的屋顶板，就是用这种水泥灌溉的，在这幢楼房里，共节省了两万多斤矽酸盐水泥。用烟灰配成的泡沫水泥，每立方公尺的造价比矽酸盐水泥低十元八角。
    北京市第六建筑工程公司准备从7月中旬起，开始在浇灌小过梁，沟盖、路面块、轻质隔断墙等小型预制构件中使用这种水泥。这个公司今年下半年计划为国家节约三万七千五百公斤矽酸盐水泥。
    这种新的水泥是北京市建筑工程局施工技术研究所试制成功的。
