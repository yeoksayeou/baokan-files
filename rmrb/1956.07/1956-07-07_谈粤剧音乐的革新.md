    On the Innovation of Cantonese Opera Music
    Li Ling
    The Guangdong Cantonese Opera Troupe's tour has aroused great interest among the capital's audience. In particular, the richness and improvement of Cantonese opera music have left a deep impression on the audience.
    Many people were previously familiar with the small tunes (interlude music) and melodies in Cantonese opera music. This part of the music, due to the lack of language barriers, has long been spread throughout the country, gradually forming the main repertoire of Chinese instrumental music. Small tunes such as "Dragon Boat Race," "Zhaojun's Lament," and "Double Sigh of Regret" are welcomed and well-evaluated in various brotherly countries in Eastern Europe.
    However, the singing part of Cantonese opera music, especially the Bangzi and Erhuang melodies, is still relatively unfamiliar to northern audiences due to pronunciation differences. The subtitles used by the Cantonese Opera Troupe in its performances in the capital to reduce the audience's difficulties made it easier for the audience to appreciate the true meaning of the singing. Therefore, many people who have heard Cantonese opera feel that Cantonese opera music not only has strong local characteristics but also has a certain artistic achievement.
    According to the research of older artists, Cantonese opera music originated from Yiyang Opera, grew from Kunqu Opera, and may have been the first to break through the form of Kunqu Opera. Among various operas, it incorporated some tunes from Huizhou Opera, Siping, Erhuang, Yiyang Opera, Xiangyang Opera, and even Hainan Opera, and gradually formed a kind of opera with strong local colors by merging with Guangdong folk music. After continuous reform, these singing styles have changed greatly from the original tune patterns, but if we analyze them carefully, they have a very close blood relationship with other brotherly opera types. For example, "Xipi" (one of the main tunes of Cantonese opera) and "Siping Tune" are of the same tune type; "Erliu" and "Gunhua" are similar to Qinqiang Opera; various Banlu of "Bangzi" originated from Guiju Opera and Xiangju Opera, especially the early female roles' "Bangzi" tune is very similar to the tunes of Hunan Flower Drum Opera; "Nanyin" actually comes from storytelling and ballad singing in Jiangsu and Zhejiang, and later merged with Guangdong's Longzhou, Yueou, and Muyu, etc. It integrates the advantages of various opera music and combines with native musical sentiments, transforming into a novel and beautiful art form.
    The reform of Cantonese opera music roughly has two more prominent stages: one is the use of "Pinghou and Cantonese" singing around 1920, and the other is the innovation after liberation. The earliest Cantonese opera music was roughly similar to the current Gui Opera, and it was also sung in Jingyin (referred to as official dialect in Guangdong). Around the "May Fourth" Movement, Guangdong's industry and commerce and overseas Chinese capital developed, and the audience of Cantonese opera expanded day by day, demanding that Cantonese opera music be understandable and sound intimate. This greatly stimulated changes in singing methods, pronunciation, and singing styles. Famous actors such as Bai Jurong, Ma Shizeng, Xue Juexian, and Li Cuifang were all the main figures involved in this spontaneous reform movement.
    The characteristics of the reform at that time were: singing in Cantonese (a very small part, such as official scenes, was still sung in the Guangdong official dialect). Guangdong folk songs such as Longzhou, Yueou, and Hainan tunes were absorbed into Cantonese opera singing; the orchestra used some Western musical instruments (such as violins, clarinets, trumpets, etc.) for accompaniment, interludes and tunes increased, and male and female voices used ordinary singing methods (only some male dan roles used falsetto). Among them, what was particularly important was that the inherent singing styles of Erhuang, Bangzi, and Nanyin developed due to the changes in pronunciation when Cantonese was used for singing; coupled with the artists' competition to create, the basic singing styles of Cantonese opera underwent fundamental changes. In addition, the adoption of various modes such as Zhengxian, Fanxian, Shigong, and Yifan affected various tunes, thereby creating and developing many new singing styles. For example, "Yifan Erhuang," "Long Sentence Erhuang," and "Flowing Nanyin" were all created and developed at this time.
    After 1937, due to the one-sided pursuit of new tunes, it gradually became chaotic. Instrumental tunes such as "Qishan Feng," which were not suitable for singing at all, were fitted with lyrics for singing, and Shanghai dance hall tunes such as "Man Chang Fei" also appeared on the Cantonese opera stage. The use of Western musical instruments was also unselective. Instruments such as guitars, along with Hawaiian playing methods, were all moved in, no wonder the audience at that time laughed and cried.
    It was not until after liberation that the Guangdong Opera Research Association proposed restoring the excellent traditions of Cantonese opera music, eliminating the influence of imperialism and commercialization on Cantonese opera music; and vigorously engaged in research, sorting out, innovation, and creation. After several years of efforts, Cantonese opera music has the new look seen in the recent performances of the Guangdong Cantonese Opera Troupe.
    The achievement of the reform of Cantonese opera music is first to restore and develop the inherent excellent tunes, such as Bangzi slow, medium, and slow-medium tempos; because in the past, it was not only chaotic, but also gradually neglected. This performance of the Cantonese Opera Troupe preserved the integrity of the original singing style and greatly strengthened its expressiveness. For example, the duet between Cuilian and Zhang Yimin in the academy in "Searching the Academy," and Qin Xianglian's singing of "Fanxian Slow Tempo" in "Qin Xianglian," "Persuading My Husband Not to Pretend to Be Foolish," etc., are fresh, complete, and deeply moving.
    Another example is the Erhuang tune, which not only purely preserves the original beautiful melody and perfect structure, but also makes creative improvements according to the plot and the current situation of the characters in the play. Like the phrase "The so-called love is still mixed with hate, it is inevitable that it cannot be given up" sung by Zeng Rong in "Pan Fu" (Erhuang singing style, in the past, basically a sentence was divided into several times to sing), the original melody sang to "give up" and then after an interlude sang "cannot." The word "cannot" is always handled with a very long drawn-out tone, which makes the actors feel fragmented and not focused in the emotional processing, and the audience cannot appreciate the meaning of the words more coherently. Therefore, after joint research by the composer and the actors, they creatively streamlined and developed the ending sentence, making it completely connected with the previous tune and becoming a new tune. I think this innovative method of cooperation between actors and composers is very worthy of learning.
    Cantonese opera music has long been performed in some dramas of family life and love, so it has special creations in the development of lyric tunes. Many people who have heard Cantonese opera feel that Cantonese opera's music that expresses tenderness, sadness, and narrates the state of mind is much more accomplished than other opera types. For example, Qin Xianglian sings, "Yifan Medium Tempo" "Tears and Grief Call My Husband," "Bitter Throat Nanyin" "After the Husband Left," etc., the melody is free and suitable for the characteristics of the language, and the mode is mournful and deep; many audiences hear these songs from the actors and can't help but feel sad and tearful.
    However, in the sorting out and development of Cantonese opera singing, we can still see the traces of excessive fragmentation caused by the past pursuit of change. Like Qin Xianglian's scene in "Shoutang," this is unique to Guangdong opera. Qin Xianglian used "Gunhua," the tune "Do Not Recognize Wife," "Yifan Xipi," the tune "Pomegranate Flower," "Yifan Liantan," and "Bitter Throat Nanyin" from "holding the pipa in her hand and grief arises" to withdrawing from this short paragraph. Changing every few sentences, the mode changes greatly. It sounds not only fragmented, but also the transposition is very abrupt. Such splicing is worthy of study.
    The original interlude music of Cantonese opera (commonly known as "Guangdong Small Tunes") is very famous. They often play a section of small tunes during interludes or curtain changes to gradually lead the audience to another plot; sometimes they add a section of small tunes according to the needs of the plot to increase the dramatic atmosphere. After liberation, composers further developed these interlude tunes into "overtures" or "interludes." For example, the newly sorted "Qin Xianglian," "Searching the Academy," "Luo Han Qian," etc. all wrote "overture" according to the theme of the drama and used simple harmonic counterpoint methods to compile. They believe that it is not a big problem to make vigorous improvements to the "overture" or "interlude"; if you want to match the music that creates the atmosphere in the progress of the drama, you will often encounter many difficulties. Cantonese opera actors are mostly accustomed to the method of constantly repeating short sentences to enhance the atmosphere, so they often feel restricted by some newly created tunes. This problem has not been well resolved until now. Some audiences also think that only a few notes are used repeatedly, feeling a lack of change. This needs to be continuously improved in practice in the future.
    The second is the reorganization of the application of musical instruments. The application of the distinctive Guangdong Erhu has been greatly strengthened. The use of Coconut Hu, Sanxian, Throat Pipe, and Long Pipe has been restored, and bass Huqin and Ruanqin have been added to better express the color of folk music.
    The richness and diversity of percussion instruments is also one of the characteristics of Cantonese music. The drums include high drums (single drums), small drums (Beijing drums), medium drums, large drums, and wooden board drums; the gongs include small gongs, literary gongs, cloud gongs, large gongs, and Beijing gongs, of which the large gongs and Beijing gongs have special effects. There are also two sizes of cymbals. Such a complete band is also rare.
    As for the use of Western musical instruments, appropriate choices have now been made. Instruments such as trumpets, clarinets, electric steel plate pianos, especially guitars, have been abandoned, and only violins and soil winds have been retained. Because these instruments have a good foundation among the audience and have expanded the range of Cantonese music. For some tunes, such as "Fast Qin Yin" and some low-pitched singing styles, if the existing folk music is used for performance, it is necessary to raise it by an octave when it reaches the extremely low notes to perform, which is easy to destroy the integrity of the tune. Such selective use of Western musical instruments enriches the timbre of the orchestra and makes the performance of the tune perfect and smooth. This is a good experience.
    The composition and timbre of the Cantonese opera orchestra are very rich, with many types (usually about twenty kinds, sometimes as many as thirty or forty), and the tones are harmonious. They pay great attention to the musical effect and often select musical instruments according to the plot, characters, and plot, and sometimes use them according to the timbre characteristics of a certain actor; sometimes the actor speaks, and the orchestra uses plucked instruments or certain instruments to accompany softly. Percussion instruments are placed on the side of the stage, and stringed instruments are placed in the orchestra pit, so that the volume of the orchestra is balanced. This is also a better attempt.
    They also pay great attention to the expressiveness of the orchestra. Its range of strength is very large, sometimes light and lovely, sometimes majestic and impassioned; these are done more meticulously.
    Third, Cantonese opera's singing has been changed to Pinghou. In the classification of voices, there are tenor (such as young male roles, young martial roles), baritone, bass (mostly clown roles, young male roles), soprano (flower dan), and contralto (old female roles). Among them, the contralto has only been determined in recent years (in the past, it was mostly played by male roles, and Yue'er sang the bass as a counter-sung male voice. For example, the Guotai (played by Huang Jieping) in "Qin Xianglian" is a new type of contralto. She also sang high notes at first, but later found that she could not only play the old dan, but also that her timbre was suitable for contralto; after she practiced and expanded the bass, she sang with great characteristics and enhanced the character and characteristics of the characters at the same time.
    Some Cantonese opera actors have high singing skills. For example, Hong Xiannv is known for her beautiful timbre, clear pronunciation, melodious singing, and delicate performance. Bai Jurong is famous for his stable singing, full timbre. Ma Shizeng is humorous and sophisticated. Each has its own strengths. But in recent years, they have continued to demand improvement. What is most admirable is Ma Shizeng. In the past, he often excessively pursued short staccato notes in singing. After returning to China, he accepted the audience's opinions and improved again and again, making his singing simple and kind. This humble and sincere spirit of treating the opinions of the masses is rare and precious.
    In the past, Cantonese opera had so-called four-pillar system and six-pillar system, that is, it only required four or six more important actors to be enough, and the performances of the rest of the people were not important. In recent years, this unreasonable system has also been broken. In the selection of actors, try to ask for comprehensive care; not only do the work, but also require the voice to have a good foundation and training. Like the drama "Qin Xianglian," there are many actors, but each actor has a certain level in singing.
    The innovation of Cantonese opera music in the past few years is gratifying. It has enabled Cantonese opera music to return to its original excellent traditional foundation for development. Although there are still some weaknesses and shortcomings in the steady progress, if the cooperative improvement spirit of the arranger and actors can be further developed, more processing and polishing can be done in singing, and the reform experience of brotherly opera types can be referred to, I believe that Cantonese opera music will have a more brilliant future.

    谈粤剧音乐的革新
    李凌
    广东粤剧团的巡回演出，引起首都观众极大的兴趣。特别是粤剧音乐的丰富和改进，给观众留下很深的印象。
    好些人，过去对粤剧音乐中的小曲（过场曲）、小调比较熟悉。这一部分音乐，由于没有语言的隔阂，很早已经流传到全国各地，渐渐形成为我国器乐曲的主要曲目。像“赛龙夺锦”、“昭君怨”、“双声恨”等小曲，在东欧各兄弟国家，都受到欢迎和较好的评价。
    但对于粤剧音乐的唱腔部分，特别是梆子、二黄，因为语音的关系，对北方听众来说，还是比较生疏的。粤剧团在首都的演出，为了减少听众的困难所采用的字幕，使得听众较容易欣赏到唱腔的真意。因此许多听过粤剧的人，都觉得粤剧音乐，不仅具有浓厚的地方特色，而且在艺术的造诣上也有一定的成就。
    粤剧音乐，据老辈艺人的研究，起于弋阳腔，壮大自昆曲、可能最早突破了昆曲的形式，在众腔之中，兼收徽调、四平、二黄、弋阳腔、襄阳腔甚至海南戏等的一些腔调，并和广东的民间音乐融合，逐渐形成一种带有强烈的地方色彩的戏曲。这些唱腔经过不断的改革，到了现在，虽然和原来的曲牌的面貌相差很大，但如果细细地分析，它和其他兄弟剧种是有着极密切的血缘关系。如“西皮”（粤剧主要曲牌之一）和“四平调”同一曲型；“二流”、“滚花”和秦腔相近；“梆子”各种板路脱胎于桂剧、湘剧，特别是早期的旦腔“梆子”和湖南的花鼓戏的曲调极相似；“南音”其实来自江浙的弹词，后来同广东的龙州、粤讴、木鱼相融合，……。它综合了各剧种音乐的优点，同土生土长的音乐情调结合，蜕化成一种新异而优美的艺术形式。
    粤剧音乐的改革，大致有两个较突出的阶段，一是在1920年左右的采用“平喉和粤语”演唱，一是解放后的革新。最初的粤剧音乐，大致和现在的桂戏差不多，也用京音（广东称为官腔）演唱。“五四”运动前后，广东的工商业和华侨资本获得了发展，粤剧观众一天天扩大，要求粤剧音乐听得懂，听起来亲切。这就大大地刺激了唱法、语音和唱腔上的变化，当时的名演员如白驹荣、马师曾、薛觉先、李翠芳等人都是参与这一自发的改革运动的主要人物。
    那时革新的特点是：用粤语演唱（极少部分如官场场面仍用广东官腔演唱）。广东民间歌调如龙州、粤讴、海南曲等被吸收为粤剧唱腔；乐队采用一些西洋乐器（如小提琴、黑管、小号等）伴奏，过场小曲增加，男女声采用普通唱歌方法演唱（只部分男旦角用子喉）。其中特别重要的是二黄、梆子、南音各种固有唱腔，因采用粤语演唱时语音的变动，促使曲调有了发展；加上艺人们的竞相创造，使粤曲基本唱腔，起了基本上的变化。加上正线、反线、士工，乙反各种调式的采用，都波及各种曲牌，从而创造和发展了不少新的唱腔。如“乙反二黄”、“长句二黄”、“流水南音”就都是这时所创造和发展出来的。
    1937年以后，由于片面地探求新腔，渐渐变得杂乱无章。器乐小曲如“岐山凤”等根本不适合演唱的小曲都配上歌词演唱，上海舞场的小调如“满场飞”等也上了粤剧舞台。西洋乐器的采用也毫无选择，像吉他等乐器连同夏威夷的演奏方法也都搬了进来，无怪当时的观众听了啼笑皆非。
    直到解放以后，广东戏曲研究会提出了恢复粤剧音乐的优秀传统，清除粤剧音乐上的帝国主义和商业化影响；大力从事研究整理，革新创造。经过这几年的努力，粤剧音乐才有像广东粤剧团最近演出时所看到的新面貌。
    粤剧音乐改革的成就，首先是恢复和发展了固有的优秀曲牌，如梆子慢、中、慢中板；因为在过去的日子里，不仅是混乱，而且渐渐不受重视。这次粤剧团的演出，一方面保存了原有唱腔的完整性，并且大力加强了它的表现力。如“搜书院”中翠莲在书院和张逸民的对唱，“秦香莲”中秦香莲唱“反线慢板”、“劝夫君你莫要装痴作哑”等段，都是新鲜完整、感人至深的。
    又如二黄曲牌，不仅纯真地保留了原来的优美旋律和完美的结构，而且根据剧情和剧中人物当时的情景，作了创造性的改进。像“盘夫”中曾荣唱的二王“所谓爱还带恨未免割舍不能”之类的乐句，（二黄唱腔，过去基本上都是将一句词分几次来唱的）原来的旋律唱到“割舍”之后经过一句过门然后再唱“不能”。而“不能”二字，总是用很长的拖腔来处理，这样便使得演员在情感的处理上感到零碎、不集中，听众也不能比较连贯地来欣赏词意。因此他们在编曲者和演员的共同研究之后，创造性地把尾句精简发展，使它和前面的曲调完整地连接起来，变成一种新曲调。我认为这种演员和作曲者共同合作的革新办法是很值得学习的。
    粤剧音乐由于长期地表现一些家庭生活和爱情的剧目，因此在抒情曲调的发展上，有着特出的创造。许多听过粤曲的人，觉得粤曲表现柔情、悲哀、诉述心境的音乐的造诣比其他曲种要高得多。如秦香莲唱的，“乙反中板”“忍泪含悲叫句我良人”、“苦喉南音”“郎去后”等段，旋律自由适合语言的特点，调式哀怨而深沉；许多观众听到演员这些歌唱，不觉凄然泪下。
    不过，在粤曲唱腔的整理发展中，仍然还能看到过去为了求变化造成的过分零碎的痕迹。像秦香莲在“寿堂”的一场，这是广东戏特有的。秦香莲从“手抱琵琶悲从中起”到退出这短短的一段，就采用了“滚花”、小曲“不认妻”、“乙反西皮”、小曲“石榴花”、“乙反恋弹”、“苦喉南音”等六、七种曲牌。几句一换，调式变动很大。听起来不但感到支离破碎，而且转调非常突然。像这样的剪接是值得研究的。
    粤剧原来的过场音乐（普通称为“广东小曲”）是非常有名的。他们常常在过场或换幕时选奏一段小曲，把观众渐渐引到另一情节；有时按剧情的需要，配上一段小曲，增加戏剧气氛。解放以后，作曲家们把这些过场曲进一步发展为“序曲”或“间奏曲”。如新整理的“秦香莲”、“搜书院”、“罗汉钱”等都根据戏剧主题写了“序幕曲”，并且采用了简单的和声对位方法编写。他们认为要将“序曲”或“间奏曲”作大力的改进，问题不大；如要在戏剧进行中配合创造气氛的乐曲，就常常碰到很多困难。粤剧演员大都习惯于短句不断重复的方法来增进气氛，因而对于新作的一些曲调，每每觉得受束缚。这个问题到现在还没有很好的解决。有些观众听了也认为仅仅几个音反复使用，感到缺乏变化。这一点需要今后在实践中不断改进。
    第二是对乐器的应用进行了整理。富有特色的广东二胡的应用大大加强了。椰胡、三弦、喉管、长管等恢复使用，又增加了低音胡琴、阮琴，更好地表现了民乐色彩。
    打击乐器的丰富多样，也是粤乐的特色之一。鼓有高鼓（单鼓）、小鼓（京鼓）、中鼓、大鼓，还有木板鼓；锣有小锣、文锣、云锣、大锣、京锣，其中大锣和京锣，都有特殊的效果。钹也有大小两种。像这样完整的乐队也是少见的。
    至于西洋乐器的采用，现在也进行了适当的选择。如小号、黑管、电气钢板琴，特别是吉他等都放弃不用，只保留了小提琴、索土风。因为这些乐器已在观众中有了很好的基础，而且扩大了粤曲的音域。好些曲调，如“快琴音”和一些低音的唱腔，如果用现有的民乐演奏，到了极低的几个音时，一定要提升八度才能表演，容易破坏曲调的完整性。像他们这样有选择的采用西洋乐器，一方面丰富了乐队的音色，同时也使曲调的表演获得完美顺畅，这是很好的经验。
    粤剧乐队的组成，和音色的配合非常丰富，种类众多（通常采用二十种左右，有时多到三、四十种），音调谐和。他们很注意音乐效果，并且常常根据剧情、人物、情节选用乐器，有时还根据某一演员的音色特点而配用；有时演员说白，乐队则用拨弹乐器或某些乐器轻声伴和。打击乐放在台侧，管弦乐放在乐池，使乐队音量得到均衡，这也是较好的尝试。
    他们对乐队的表现力也非常注意。它的强弱幅度很大，有时轻清可爱，有时雄壮、激昂；这些都做得比较细致。
    第三，粤剧的演唱自改了平喉以来，在声部的分类上，有男高音（如小生、小武）、男中音、低音（多半是丑生、生生）、女高音（花旦）、女低音（老旦）。其中女低音还是近年来才确定的（过去多用男角担任，月儿演唱低音是当作反唱男声来使用的，像“秦香莲”中的国太（黄洁屏饰）就是女低音的新型。她最初也是唱高音的，后来发现她不仅能演老旦，而且音质也适合于女低音；在她练习和扩大了低音以后，演唱得很有特色了，同时也增强了人物的性格和特点。
    有些粤剧演员的演唱，技巧很高。如红线女等是以音色优美、语音清晰、唱腔婉转，表演精细见称。白驹荣是以行腔稳重、音色充实闻名。马师曾则是诙谐老练。各有各的特长。但是他们在近几年来仍然不断要求改进。最使人敬佩的是马师曾，他过去在歌唱上常常过分追求短顿音，回国以后，接受了观众的意见，一次又一次的改进，使他的演唱变得纯朴而亲切。这种虚心诚恳地对待群众意见的改进精神，是难得而宝贵的。
    过去，粤剧曾有所谓四柱制、六柱制，就是只要求有四个、或六个较主要的演员就够了，其余的人的表演都是不重要的。这几年来，也打破了这种不合理的制度。在演员的选择上，尽量要求全面的照顾；不仅做工，而且声音也要求有较好的基础和训练。像“秦香莲”一剧，演员不少，但每一个演员，都在歌唱上具有一定的水平。
    粤剧音乐这几年的革新是令人高兴的。它使粤剧音乐回复到原有的优秀的传统基础上来发展。在稳步向前中，虽然仍有一些弱点和不足，如果能够进一步发挥编曲者和演员的合作改进精神，在演唱上作更多的加工琢磨，并且参考兄弟剧种的改革经验，我相信粤剧音乐一定会有更灿烂的前途。
