Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, 3rd. More than a thousand employees of the Anshan Iron and Steel Company, who had been living in dilapidated temporary housing, have begun to move into newly built employee residences. From the day before yesterday to today, one hundred and two construction worker families have already moved into their new homes.

Three years ago, in order to meet the urgent needs of its employees, the Anshan Iron and Steel Company built a batch of simple earthen houses nearby to serve as employee dormitories. Now that these earthen houses are no longer habitable, the Anshan Iron and Steel Company has allocated more than 20,000 square meters of housing from the more than 150,000 square meters of residences newly built this year for these thousand-plus workers to live in.

    迁入新居
    新华社鞍山3日电　鞍山钢铁公司一千多户住在破旧的简易住宅中的职工开始搬入新建的职工住宅。从前天到今天，已经有一百零二户建筑工人迁入新居。
    三年前，鞍山钢铁公司为了满足职工的迫切需要，在附近修建了一批简陋的土房子，作为职工宿舍。现在这些土房子不能再住下去，鞍山钢铁公司从今年新建的十五万多平方公尺的住宅中，拨出两万多平方公尺住宅给这一千多户工人居住。
