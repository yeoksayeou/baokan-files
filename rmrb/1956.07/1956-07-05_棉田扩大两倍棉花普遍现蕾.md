    Cotton Fields Expand Twofold, Cotton Plants Universally Show Buds
    The cotton in the Manas River basin is universally showing buds. Last year, this area only had 82,000 mu of cotton fields, but this year it has more than 240,000 mu. With the expansion of the cotton field area, the cotton fields managed by the soldiers of the Production and Construction Corps have also increased. Although mechanical cultivation is used, there is still a shortage of labor. A new group of young volunteers who came from Henan to reclaim wasteland immediately joined the management of the cotton fields after a few days of rest. With the help of experienced male and female soldiers in cotton planting, they will soon be armed with advanced cultivation techniques.
    This year, the climate in the Manas River basin is abnormal, with alternating sunny and rainy days, and sometimes sudden cold weather, which affects the normal growth of cotton. Some cotton fields have also been ravaged by hailstorms. When the weather suddenly changed, some soldiers braved the heavy rain to stay in the cotton fields. When the meteorological station forecast that the temperature would drop, Zhang Zhonghan, the deputy political commissar of the Production and Construction Corps, got up late at night and took a flashlight to check the outdoor thermometer. This man, who once opened up wasteland in Nanniwan in northern Shaanxi, has been concerned about cotton for six years! When the cotton was shipped from Xinjiang to Xi'an and Shanghai, people who saw these "white gold" knew how hard it was to come by. (Attached picture)

### 棉田扩大两倍棉花普遍现蕾

    棉田扩大两倍棉花普遍现蕾
    玛纳斯河流域的棉花普遍现蕾了。去年这个地区还只有八万二千亩棉田，今年已经有二十四万多亩了。棉田的面积扩大，生产建设部队的战士们管理的棉田也随着增多，尽管是用机械耕作，劳动力仍然感到不足。新从河南来的一批志愿垦荒的青年，休息几天以后，马上参加了棉田管理，他们在富有植棉经验的男女战士帮助下，将很快被先进的耕作技术武装起来。
    今年玛纳斯河流域的气候不正常，时晴时雨，有时天气骤冷，影响棉花正常的生长，有一部分棉田，还受到冰雹的摧残。当天气突变时，有的战士，冒着大雨守在棉田里。当气象台预报气温将降低时，生产建设部队的副政治委员张仲翰深夜起来，拿着电筒去看室外的气温表。这位曾经在陕北南泥湾开过荒的人，六年来为棉花操过多少心思啊！在棉花从新疆装运到西安、上海的时候，人们看到这些“白色的金子”，当知它来得多么不容易。（附图片）
