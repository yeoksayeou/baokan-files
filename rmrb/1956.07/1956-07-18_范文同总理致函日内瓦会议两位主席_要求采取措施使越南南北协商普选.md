Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, July 16th: The government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has requested the two chairmen of the Geneva Conference to take necessary measures to enable the consultation conference between the North and South Vietnamese governments to be held, the nationwide free general election to be conducted, and the unification of Vietnam to be realized. This request from the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam was made by Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs Pham Van Dong in a letter to the two chairmen of the Geneva Conference on July 13.

Pham Van Dong told the two chairmen of the Geneva Conference that all the Vietnamese people demand that the unification of their country must be achieved through free general elections, and demand that their legitimate aspirations and national rights recognized by the Geneva Accords be respected. Only when the unification of Vietnam is achieved can peace in Vietnam and Southeast Asia be consolidated and lasting.

Pham Van Dong said that now, the deadline set by the Geneva Accords for realizing free general elections to unify Vietnam, namely July 1956, has arrived, but the South Vietnamese regime still refuses bilateral consultations. Therefore, free general elections have not been realized, and the implementation of the Geneva Accords has been seriously undermined. The South Vietnamese regime should bear full responsibility for the above situation; according to the Geneva Accords and the recommendations of the two chairmen, the French government should also bear its own responsibility.

Pham Van Dong pointed out that, legally, practically, and in action, the Southern regime is fully bound by the Geneva Accords and has the responsibility to implement the Geneva Accords and realize the general elections stipulated by the Geneva Accords.

In the letter, Pham Van Dong described the efforts made by the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam to strive for the realization of the political clauses of the Geneva Accords, and pointed out that the position and attitude of the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam in strictly and thoroughly implementing the Geneva Accords is fully in line with the wishes of the Vietnamese people and peace-loving people of the world.

    范文同总理致函日内瓦会议两位主席
    要求采取措施使越南南北协商普选
    新华社河内16日电　越南民主共和国政府已经要求日内瓦会议两位主席采取必要的措施，使越南北南双方政府的协商会议得以举行，全国的自由普选得以进行，越南的统一得以实现。越南民主共和国政府的这个要求，是由总理兼外交部长范文同在七月十三日写给日内瓦会议两位主席的信件中提出的。
    范文同告诉日内瓦会议的两位主席说，全体越南人民要求必须通过自由普选的方式实现他们的国家的统一，要求尊重日内瓦协定所承认的他们的正当愿望和民族权利。越南的统一得以实现，越南和东南亚的和平才能巩固和持久。
    范文同说，现在，日内瓦协定所规定的实现自由普选以统一越南的期限，即1956年7月已经到了，但是越南南方政权仍旧拒绝双方的协商。因此，自由普选未能实现，日内瓦协定的履行遭到严重的破坏。越南南方政权对上述情况应负完全责任；根据日内瓦协定和两位主席的建议，法国政府也应承担自己的责任。
    范文同指出，在法理上、实际上和行动上，南方政权完全受日内瓦协定的约束，有责任履行日内瓦协定和实现由日内瓦协定所规定的普选。
    范文同在信中叙述了越南民主共和国政府在争取实现日内瓦协定的政治条款方面所作的努力，并且指出，越南民主共和国政府严格和彻底履行日内瓦协定的立场和态度是完全符合于越南人民和世界爱好和平人民的愿望的。
