Xinhua News Agency, Xining, July 18th: Health and epidemic prevention personnel engaged in eliminating mosquitoes in the Qaidam Basin recently reported to the Qinghai Provincial Department of Health that adult mosquitoes have been basically eliminated in areas where pesticides have been sprayed, and mosquito larvae in stagnant water pits have also been poisoned to death.

This group of health and epidemic prevention personnel, numbering more than twenty, was dispatched by the Qinghai Provincial Department of Health. They began focusing on mosquito eradication work in the Qaidam Basin in May.

Mosquitoes are abundant in the marsh areas of the Qaidam Basin and in areas overgrown with shrubs and wild grasses such as sand willows and reeds. Personnel engaged in topographic surveying, geological exploration, housing construction, and land reclamation in these areas must wear mosquito nets to work. In July of last year, the Qinghai Provincial Department of Health organized a working group to investigate the types of mosquitoes and breeding conditions in the Qaidam Basin. In addition to continuing to investigate mosquito species, breeding grounds, overwintering conditions, and the epidemic diseases they can transmit, the mosquito eradication team sent to the Qaidam Basin this year will also focus on spraying pesticides in an area of one million square meters to eliminate adult mosquitoes.

    在柴达木盆地消灭蚊子
    新华社西宁18日电　在柴达木盆地消灭蚊子的卫生防疫人员最近向青海省卫生厅报告说，凡是用药剂喷撒过的地区，成蚊已经基本消灭，死水坑中的蚊子幼虫也被毒死。
    这批卫生防疫人员共二十多人，是由青海省卫生厅派出的。他们从五月开始就在柴达木盆地有重点地进行灭蚊工作。
    柴达木盆地的沼泽地区和生长着沙柳、芦苇等灌木、野草的区域，蚊子很多。在这些地区进行地形测量、地质勘探、房屋建筑和开垦荒地的人员，都得戴上防蚊罩工作。青海省卫生厅在去年七月曾组织工作组到柴达木盆地调查蚊子的种类和孳生条件。今年派往柴达木盆地的灭蚊队，除了继续调查蚊子的种类、孳生地、越冬情况及其所能传染的疫病等以外，还要在一百万平方公尺的面积内重点进行药剂喷撒工作，消灭成蚊。
