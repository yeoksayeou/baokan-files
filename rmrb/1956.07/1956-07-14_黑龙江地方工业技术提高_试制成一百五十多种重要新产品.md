Heilongjiang Local Industry Improves Technology
Trial-Produces More Than 150 Important New Products

(Our dispatch) This year in the first half of the year, Heilongjiang province's local industrial enterprises successfully trial-produced nearly 150 new products. Among them, 62 have been officially put into production.

Among these new products, some serve state-owned industries. Such as the KO-16 electric furnace for industrial experiments, steel paper tubes suitable for high and low voltage switches and various lightning arrester parts, solid rust inhibitors for industrial boilers, logging rubber shoes for forest industry workers, leather washes for wiping light metals, and car horns for the First Automobile Factory. Some serve the agricultural economy, such as Liberation-style waterwheels, axial-flow pumps, efficient and durable striated small threshers, tractor-drawn rocker arm harvesters, feed crushers, and clear water rice milling machines. These new products are very popular in the market. For example, the wooden hand-cranked waterwheel trial-produced by Acheng Iron Factory pumps 40 tons of water per hour, which is 30% more efficient than the Liberation-style waterwheel, and the cost is very low. At the technical appraisal meeting, farmers requested to place orders. The manure filter box trial-produced by Yilan County Iron Factory saves fertilizer and can maintain soil moisture, which is also very popular among farmers. The logging rubber shoes trial-produced by Harbin Rubber Shoe Factory meet the needs of workers in forest areas and are now in short supply. Among these new products, some have never been manufactured in China, such as steel paper tubes, rocker arm harvesters, KO-16 electric furnaces, and water bicycles. These all mark a step forward in the technology of Heilongjiang Province's industry. At present, all factories are carrying out more intensive trial production and research work, and plan to trial-produce another 111 new products in the second half of this year.

    黑龙江地方工业技术提高
    试制成一百五十多种重要新产品
    本报讯　今年上半年，黑龙江省地方工业企业试制成功了近一百五十多种新产品。其中62种已正式生产。
    这些新产品中，有的是为国营工业服务的。如供工业实验用的KO—16电炉，适用于高低压开关及各种避雷器零件用的钢纸管，工业锅炉用的固体防锈剂，森林工业工人用的伐木胶鞋，拭擦轻金属用的洗革，第一汽车厂用的汽车喇叭等。有为农业经济服务的。如解放式水车，轴流式水泵，效率大、耐力强的纹杆式小型脱谷机，机引摇臂收割机，饲料粉碎机，清水制米机等，这些新产品很受市场欢迎。如阿城铁工厂试制的木制手摇水车，每小时抽水40吨，比解放式水车的效率高30％，成本又很低，在技术鉴定会上，农民纷纷提出订货。依兰县铁工厂试制的滤粪箱，又省肥料，又可以保持土壤水分，也很受农民欢迎。哈尔滨胶鞋厂试制的伐木胶鞋适合林区工人需要，现在已经供不应求。这些新产品中，还有些是我国从未制造过的，如钢纸管、摇臂收割机、KO—16电炉、水上自行车等。这些都标志着黑龙江省工业在技术上跃进了一步。目前各厂都在进行更紧张的试制研究工作，计划在今年下半年内，再试制一百十一种新产品。
