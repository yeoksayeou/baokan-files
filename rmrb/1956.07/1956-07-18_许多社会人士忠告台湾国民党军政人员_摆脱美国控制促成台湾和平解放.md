Xinhua News Agency, July 17th: Recently, many former Kuomintang military and government personnel in Wuhan, Xi'an, Chengdu, Chongqing, Guangzhou, Jinan, and Hefei held gatherings to discuss how to contribute to the peaceful liberation of Taiwan.

    These meetings were convened by the provincial and municipal organizations of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) or local organizations of democratic parties.

    At the symposiums held in various places, speakers unanimously supported Premier Zhou Enlai's speech on the peaceful liberation of Taiwan at the Third Session of the First National People's Congress. These former Kuomintang military and government personnel all hoped that their old friends, classmates, and colleagues in Taiwan would promptly awaken, resolutely break free from American control, and facilitate the early peaceful liberation of Taiwan.

    Yan Daogang, former Director of the Kuomintang Military Commission Chairman's Office and current member of the Hubei Provincial People's Committee, said that Premier Zhou's renewed discussion of the peaceful liberation of Taiwan, "is even more sincere in its purpose and more detailed in its methods. We, therefore, feel even more the generosity and wisdom of the Communist Party and the government. Patriotism unites all, regardless of when they join. Kuomintang military and government personnel in Taiwan should promptly awaken and return to the right path." Sun Weiru, former Commander of the Sixth War Zone of the Kuomintang, Chairman of the Kuomintang Shaanxi Provincial Government, and current Vice Chairman of the Shaanxi Provincial CPPCC, who participated in the "Xi'an Incident," said: "We only need to recall the historical facts of the 'Xi'an Incident' to know that the Chinese Communist Party has always prioritized the interests of the nation and the people. The Taiwan authorities and military and government personnel should recognize the situation, accept Premier Zhou Enlai's proposal, conduct consultations, and complete the unification of the motherland."

    At a symposium in Chongqing, Qing Yuncan, former Deputy Commander of the Kuomintang 72nd Army and current Counselor of the Chongqing Municipal People's Committee, and Guo Congyi, former Major General Deputy Commander of the Independent Division of the Kuomintang 20th Army and currently working for the People's Committee, earnestly hoped that the military and government personnel in Taiwan would consider their personal interests and quickly choose their own future. They said that the socialist construction of the motherland is advancing rapidly, and everyone is living a happy and fulfilling life. Should the Kuomintang military and government personnel in Taiwan continue to live a humiliating life of dependence on others? Or should they return to the embrace of the motherland and reunite with their families? They should make a choice, turn back as soon as possible, abandon the darkness and embrace the light. This is not only related to their own future, but also to the expectations of the elders in the motherland.

    Some people, in their speeches, used their own experiences to illustrate the policies of the People's Government. They hoped that the Kuomintang military and government personnel in Taiwan would no longer have any concerns. Cheng Weihuang, former Director of the Political Department of the Kuomintang Hebei-Chahar War Zone and Secretary-General of the Special Party Headquarters, and now a member of the Chongqing Municipal CPPCC, said, "I was a senior responsible person in the Kuomintang army, but the People's Government does not hold past misdeeds against me, but gives me generous treatment in politics and economics. I hope that my subordinates, relatives, and friends in Taiwan will not have any concerns, try to return, and devote themselves to the construction of the motherland." Lei Xiumin, former Commander of the 152nd Division of the Kuomintang 63rd Army, said at a symposium held in Guangzhou that the policies of the Communist Party and the People's Government towards former Kuomintang military and government personnel are benevolent and righteous to the utmost. Perhaps some people still suspect, as I did in the past, that the Communist Party and the government say one thing and do another; but more than eight years of contact have made me believe that the Communist Party and the government can be trusted to keep their word."

    At a symposium held in Chengdu, someone suggested: "If the Kuomintang military and government personnel in Taiwan still have doubts, we sincerely welcome them to come back and take a look first." The former Kuomintang military and government personnel who participated in the symposium in Wuhan put forward many concrete suggestions conducive to the peaceful liberation of Taiwan. Qiu Qingyong, former Deputy Director of the Guangzhou Financial Administration of the Kuomintang Ministry of Finance, said, "If the Kuomintang military and government personnel in Taiwan are willing to come back to understand the situation in the motherland, I can be their guide and bridge."

    许多社会人士忠告台湾国民党军政人员
    摆脱美国控制促成台湾和平解放
    新华社17日讯　最近武汉、西安、成都、重庆、广州、济南和合肥等地许多前国民党军政人员举行了集会，座谈如何为和平解放台湾而贡献力量。
    这些会议都是由政协省市组织或民主党派地方组织召集的。
    在各地举行的座谈会上，发言的人一致拥护周恩来总理在第一届全国人民代表大会第三次会议上关于和平解放台湾问题的发言。这些前国民党军政人员都希望在台湾的老朋友、老同学和老同事们及时猛省，毅然摆脱美国的控制，促成台湾早日和平解放。
    前国民党军事委员会委员长侍从室主任、现任湖北省人民委员会委员晏道刚说，周总理再一次谈到和平解放台湾问题，“词旨更加恳切，办法更为详尽，我们因此更感到共产党和政府的宽大与英明。爱国一家，不分先后，台湾国民党军政人员应及时猛省，回头是岸。”曾参加过西安“双十二”事变的前国民党第六战区司令长官、国民党陕西省政府主席、现任陕西省政协副主席孙蔚如说：“我们只要回忆一下当年西安‘双十二’事变的历史事实，就可以知道中国共产党从来是以国家民族的利益为重的，台湾当局和军政人员应当认清局势，接受周恩来总理的建议，进行协商，完成祖国的统一。”
    在重庆市的一个座谈会上，前国民党第七十二军副军长、现任重庆市人民委员会参事卿云灿和前国民党第二十军独立师少将副师长、现在人民委员会工作的郭从臬等，恳切地希望在台湾的军政人员应考虑个人利害，迅速地选择自己的前途。他们说，祖国社会主义建设事业突飞猛进，每个人都过着幸福美满的生活，在台湾的国民党军政人员是继续过着寄人篱下的屈辱日子呢？还是回到祖国怀抱和家人团聚？应该有所选择，从速回头，弃暗投明，这不但关系自身前途，也是祖国父老所期望的。
    有的人在发言中，以自己亲身的经历来说明人民政府的政策，他们希望在台湾的国民党军政人员不要再有任何顾虑。前国民党冀察战区政治部主任兼特别党部书记长、现在重庆市政协委员程维黄说，我在国民党军队中是高级负责人员，但人民政府不咎既往，反而在政治上、经济上给我优厚的待遇。希望在台湾的部属、亲友不要有任何顾虑，设法归来，投入祖国建设事业。前国民党六三军一五二师师长雷秀民在广州举行的一个座谈会上说，共产党和人民政府对前国民党军政人员的政策是仁至义尽的。也许还有人像我过去一样的怀疑共产党和政府讲是一套，做又是一套；但八年多的接触，使得我相信共产党和政府是讲得到、做得到的。
    在成都举行的座谈会上有人提出：如果在台湾的国民党军政人员还有疑问，我们诚恳欢迎他们先回来看看。在武汉市参加座谈会的前国民党军政人员，提出了许多有助于和平解放台湾的具体建议。前国民党财政部广州金融管理局副局长丘庆镛说，如果在台湾的国民党军政人员愿意回来了解祖国的情况，我可以做他们的向导和桥梁。
