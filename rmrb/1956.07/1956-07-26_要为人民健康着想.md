	We Must Consider the People's Health
	According to state regulations, diseased pigs suffering from infectious diseases such as erysipelas must not be slaughtered and sold. However, from March to early June this year, the Changzhou Food Company Processing Plant successively processed 56 diseased and dead pigs into pork floss or sold them as good meat. This practice of the Changzhou Food Company Processing Plant, which disregards the health of the people, should be sanctioned by state law. (Chu Songlin)

    要为人民健康着想
    按照国家规定，患丹毒等传染性的病猪不得宰杀出售。但常州市食品公司加工厂在今年三月到六月上旬，先后把五十六头病、死猪肉制作肉松或充作好肉出卖。常州市食品公司加工厂的这种不顾人民健康的作法，应该受到国家法律的制裁。　（储松林）
