    News? Historical Materials?
    The news item on page four of the July 5th issue threw people into a maze right from the start. What does it mean to say "During the Second Revolutionary Civil War period, 101 former Soviet area cadres in Ruijin County gloriously joined the Communist Party and returned to the embrace of the Party"? Anyone who strictly adheres to Chinese language conventions would read this passage and be unable to guess whether it is a news item or a piece of historical material on the Chinese revolution. It seems that it should be changed to: "One hundred and one former Soviet area cadres from Ruijin County during the Second Revolutionary Civil War period gloriously joined the Communist Party..." To make it clearer, the word "recently" can also be added before "Ruijin County" or before "gloriously joined."
    The photo caption on page five of the same day's newspaper states: "The Mongolian Erlianhot State-Owned Ranch is currently harvesting a huge amount of livestock feed." Obviously, the words "a huge amount of" can be omitted; otherwise, it should be changed to: "...is currently carrying out the huge work of harvesting livestock feed."
    I hope the editorial department will pay attention to eliminating this kind of grammatically incorrect phenomenon. (Lu Nianci)

    新闻呢？　史料呢？
    七月五日四版的一条新闻，一开头就使人陷入迷魂阵，什么“第二次国内革命战争时期，瑞金县一○一名前苏区干部光荣地参加了共产党，重新回到党的怀抱”。严格遵守汉语习惯的人读了这一段文字，真猜不透这是一条新闻，还是一篇中国革命史料。看来似乎应该改为：“瑞金县有一○一名第二次国内革命战争时期的苏区干部，光荣地参加了共产党……”为了说得更清楚一些，还可以在“瑞金县”或是在“光荣地参加”的前面加上“最近”两字。
    同一天报纸第五版的照片说明：“蒙古热尔哈蓝吐国营牧场正在收割牲畜饲料的巨大工作。”显然，“的巨大工作”五个字是可以省去的，否则，就应改为：“……正在进行收割牲畜饲料的巨大工作。”
    我希望编辑部注意消灭这种文理不通的现象。　（卢念慈）
