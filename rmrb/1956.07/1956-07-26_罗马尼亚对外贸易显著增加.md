    Xinhua News Agency dispatch from TASS: Romania is actively developing foreign trade activities.
    In 1955, Romania's trade volume with France increased to more than twenty-two times that of 1950. Its foreign trade volume with West Germany, the United Kingdom, Finland, Italy, and Turkey also increased several times.
    Recently, Romania's foreign trade organization, "Industrial Products Export Company," concluded contracts with Egypt, the Netherlands, West Germany, and Finland for the sale of lathes and planers to these countries; with India and the German Democratic Republic for the sale of drilling equipment to these countries; and with Turkey for the sale of electric motors, road construction machines, and welding units.
    Romania's rapidly developing national economy also requires many imported goods. Romania imports textile raw materials from Italy, wool and chemical products from the United Kingdom, clothing and cosmetics from France, equipment and pharmaceuticals from West Germany, leather and tanning materials from Argentina, cotton from Egypt, and citrus fruits, coffee, cocoa, and spices from Middle Eastern and Far Eastern countries.
