Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, July 7th. The Shenyang Pneumatic Tool Factory, remodeled from an old workshop into a modern factory, has recovered all its remodeling investment within one and a half years of production. By the end of June, the factory's profits and depreciation fees turned over to the state had already exceeded the total remodeling investment.

After the factory's remodeling, its production capacity is more than twenty-eight times greater than before, and the total remodeling investment is more than one-third less than the capital required to build a new factory of the same scale.

Since the factory went into production, it has successfully trial-produced nineteen types of pneumatic tools that China had never manufactured before, and produced tens of thousands of rock drills, rivet guns, pneumatic picks, and pneumatic drills, supplying them to the mining, metallurgy, machinery industry, transportation, water conservancy, and other departments.
