    Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, July 7th: The first hydropower station on the Yili River in northern Yunnan Province began construction on July 1st.

    The Yili River is a tributary of the Jinsha River in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River and has abundant hydropower resources. From now until the period of the Second Five-Year Plan, four hydropower stations will be built here. The entire project includes the construction of four dams, two underground power plants, and two above-ground power plants. It will also involve digging ten kilometers of tunnels and inclined shafts, and three kilometers of open channels to divert the Yili River water into the Jinsha River, making it China's first cross-basin hydropower station. Its total engineering volume is greater than the combined engineering volume of the Guanting Hydropower Station in Hebei, the Gutian Hydropower Station in Fujian, and the Shizitan Hydropower Station in Sichuan, which is about to be completed. Once completed, the total power generation will reach 330,000 kilowatts. In addition to supplying industrial electricity to northern Yunnan and Kunming and other regions, it can also meet the electricity needs for nearby farmland irrigation.

    The entire project of the hydropower station was designed by Chinese engineers and technicians under the guidance of Soviet experts.

    以礼河上第一座水电站动工
    发电总量将达三十三万瓩
    新华社昆明7日电　云南省北部以礼河上的第一座水力发电站已经在七月一日动工兴建。
    以礼河是长江上游金沙江的一条支流，水力资源丰富。从现在到第二个五年计划期间，将在这里建设四座水力发电站。全部工程包括建设四个坝、两个地下厂房和两个地面厂房，并且要开凿十公里的隧洞斜井和三公里的明渠，把以礼河水引入金沙江，成为我国第一座跨流域开发的水电站。它的工程总量比河北官厅、福建古田和即将建成的四川狮子滩三个发电站工程量的总和还要大。建成以后，发电总量共达三十三万瓩，除了供给云南北部和昆明等地区的工业用电以外，还可以满足附近农田灌溉对电力的需要。
    水电站的全部工程，是由我国的工程技术人员，在苏联专家指导下设计的。
