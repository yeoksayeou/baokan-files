    Deer
    Tian Jian
    　　Beside a mountain cliff, a stag comes to drink; three streams cascade downwards, sparkling with silvery light. In ancient times, there was an emperor who shot two whistling arrows; one pierced the deer's antlers, and the other flew across the grassland. The place where the emperor stood is now a sand dune; he said, "The city here in the future, shall be called Baoketu." [Note] Baoketu is Baotou; many years have passed, and our vast grassland is still the path of the deer.

    　　The herd of deer has left the grassland, see how quickly they flee; now all around them is the blaze of fire and the roar of thunder. On the path they’ve taken, builders pitch camp; they are turning a piece of grassland into a steel city. They are now raising their hands, to welcome a giant star; this star is steel, and steel will be born here. Our brothers will know, at the foot of the Daqing Mountains on the banks of the Yellow River, who is the true marksman? His name is: the People!

  [Note] Baoketu is a Mongolian word, meaning
  deer. (Attached picture)

    鹿
    田间
    一一座山崖的旁边，有只牡鹿来喝水；三股泉往下倾泻，亮晶晶银光四射。古代有一位皇帝，他射出两枝响箭；这一枝穿过鹿角，那一枝飞过草原。皇帝站的这块地方，就是一个沙丘；他说：“将来这里的城，要叫做包克图”。〔注〕包克图就是包头，多少年已经过去，我们广阔的草原，依然是鹿走的路。
      二群鹿已经离开草原，看它逃得多么迅速；现在在它的四面，都是火光雷声。在它走过的路上，建设者扎下野营；他们把一块草原，变成了一座钢城。他们正在举起双手，要迎接一颗巨星；这一颗星就是钢，钢要在这里诞生。我们的兄弟会知道，大青山下黄河岸上，谁是真正的射手？他的名字是：人民！

  就是鹿。（附图片）
