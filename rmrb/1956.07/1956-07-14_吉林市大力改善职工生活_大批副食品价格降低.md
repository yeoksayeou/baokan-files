Jilin City Vigorously Improves Workers' Lives
Substantial Reduction in Prices of Non-staple Foods

(Our dispatch) Jilin City has recently vigorously improved workers' welfare facilities and reduced the prices of non-staple foods.

The state-owned commercial sector in Jilin City has lowered the prices of over one hundred kinds of non-staple foods. The aquatic products company reduced the prices of fifty-one kinds of aquatic products by 15.7%. Department stores reduced the prices of forty-five kinds of pastries. The vegetable company purchased more than 180,000 jin of vegetables from twelve cities including Beijing and Guangzhou, and reduced vegetable prices by approximately 50%. To make it easier for workers to buy vegetables, it was also decided to add two markets in the factory area.

In order to solve the severe housing shortage for workers, many factories have decided to build worker housing, with one factory alone planning to build 13,000 square meters. Flour mills, waterworks, and other units have decided to build worker dormitories using a self-construction and public assistance approach.

Workers with financial difficulties have generally received relief. The City Yingzao Paper Mill sent cloth to workers who lacked clothing and bedding, and the Transportation Company subsidized sixty-three people with financial difficulties.

In order to genuinely improve the lives of workers, the Jilin City Party and government leading organs organized a 150-person inspection team in late June to conduct in-depth inspections of factories, construction sites, schools, and medical and commercial systems. Problems discovered during the inspection were promptly assigned to relevant units for improvement.
