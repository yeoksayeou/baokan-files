	Reader's Letters
	Transfer Doesn't Equal Cancellation
	In the recent process of transferring the management of traditional Chinese medicinal materials, many supply and marketing cooperatives have developed negative emotions, adopting measures such as transferring large numbers of cadres and funds, reducing inventory, and even canceling institutions and only selling without buying. For example, in the Chengde Special District Medicinal Materials Station in Hebei Province, the manager, two section chiefs, and two accountants were all transferred, which greatly affected the station's business. The manager said, "I have been working in the medicinal materials business for more than ten years, and now I have to obey the transfer, and I have no choice but to turn from an expert into a layman." Similarly, the main business cadres (including managers) of the medicinal materials departments of supply and marketing cooperatives in Qichun, Hubei, Gongxian, Huaxian, Changyuan, Henan, and Xiangyin, Hunan, have all been transferred. The Linxian Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Henan originally had 145,000 yuan in funds for operating medicinal materials, but now 110,000 yuan has been withdrawn. The Shanghe County Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Shandong Province only allows the medicinal materials department to sell goods and does not allow it to purchase goods, and all the proceeds from sales are withdrawn every day. Danfeng, Shanyang, and other county cooperatives in Shaanxi Province immediately canceled the established medicinal material institutions as soon as they heard about the transfer.
	Traditional Chinese medicinal materials are already in short supply, and this will only exacerbate the situation. It is hoped that local governments will stop this parochialism of supply and marketing cooperatives and not treat "transfer" as "cancellation." (Wu Jingqing)
	Need Children's Clothing Suitable for Children's Characteristics
	Since the beginning of summer this year, I wanted to buy an outer garment for my four-year-old son. I searched almost all the department stores and retail stores with children's clothing near Xidan in Beijing, and finally bought a more suitable uniform-style blue coat. The child was very happy when he first put it on, but he didn't want to wear it the next day, always saying his neck hurt. Upon careful inspection, I found that the collar of the clothes was the same as that of adults, with a stiff collar about an inch wide, which rubbed the child's neck red. How can three- or four-year-old children wear this kind of clothes?
	Speaking of children's pants, they are even more awkward. Especially the navy-style clothes, which are worn by four- or five-year-old children, are the same as adult clothes, with trousers tied with belts. If the belt is tied a little tighter, the child will feel uncomfortable; if it is loose, the pants will always fall down.
	I hope that department stores will consider the age and characteristics of children when making children's clothing, and make clothing suitable for them to wear. (Xiufeng)
	Can't Buy Rain Boots in the Rainy Season
	Since June, it has been raining every other day in Longhua County, Hebei Province, but rain boots cannot be bought here. I have been to various state-owned, joint state-private department stores and cooperatives in the county town, and besides a few pairs of ill-fitting flat-mouth rain boots and defective shoes, there is not a single pair of high-top ones, and it is even more difficult to buy ones for women and children.
	I hope you can supply us with some suitable rain boots as soon as possible, so that we will no longer feel that it is difficult to walk in the rainy season. (Ji Kexiang)
	Color-Changing Shirt
	A month ago, I bought a light blue Xinhua woolen shirt for more than nine yuan at the Women's Clothing Store outside Qianmen in Beijing. The next day, I happily put on this new shirt, but I didn't expect that just because I stayed in the sun for a long time, this new shirt turned into a non-gray, non-white, reddish color, looking like it had been worn for several years. (Huang Shufang)
　　It Is Difficult for Salt Field Workers to Purchase Goods
　　The Tanggu Salt Field is about twenty li away from Tanggu City. It takes the workers in the salt field two hours to walk back and forth to Tanggu City to buy things. In the past, we had raised some opinions with the commercial departments, hoping that a sales outlet could be set up in the salt field. They always said: "The salt field cannot set up a 'point' because it cannot make money." In this way, it is very inconvenient for the workers in the salt field to buy things, especially for some workers who live with their families, they have to run to Tanggu to buy grain, oil, vegetables, etc., which is more tiring than working for a day.
	The commercial departments should solve this difficult problem for the workers in the salt field. Even if they cannot set up a retail outlet in the salt field, it would be better to organize some mobile sales vendors to come than it is now. (Shao Zaitian)
	What Kind of Commercial Policy Is This?
	Recently, I went to the Tianjin Cultural Goods Company from Ninghe County, Hebei Province, to buy a huqin (Chinese fiddle). The salesperson said, "The goods here can only be sold to this city and not to people from other places." I asked why, and he said this was the "policy." He also advised me to go to the Ninghe County Supply and Marketing Cooperative to buy it. In fact, I came to Tianjin specifically because there were no huqins for sale there. At this time, I had a flash of inspiration and said, "I am from Tianjin, should you sell it to me?" The salesperson said, "That's fine. However, this is the policy, and you didn't abide by the policy." At that time, I felt both angry and amused. I thought, why is it a violation of the policy to buy things from Ninghe to Tianjin? What kind of policy is this? (Liu Jimin)

    移交不等于撤销
    在最近移交中药材经营业务的过程中，许多供销合作社产生了消极情绪，采取了大量抽调干部和资金，压缩库存，甚至撤销机构和只卖不买等作法。例如河北省承德专区药材站的经理一人、股长二人、会计二人全被调走，使药材站的业务受到很大影响。这个经理说：“我干了十几年的药材工作，现在要服从调配，只好由内行变成外行了。”又如湖北圻春、河南巩县、滑县、长垣和湖南湘阴等地供销合作社药材部的主要业务干部（包括经理）都被抽走了。河南林县供销社经营药材的资金原有十四万五千元，现在抽走了十一万元。山东商河县供销社只准药材部销货，不准进货，每天所卖的货款全部提走。陕西省丹凤、山阳等县社，听说要移交，马上把已成立的药材机构撤销。
    中药材本来供不应求，这样一来，供不应求的情况就更严重了，希望各地政府制止供销合作社这种本位主义的作法，不要把“移交”当作“撤销”。　（吴敬卿）
    需要适合儿童特点的童装
    今年入夏以来，我想为我的四岁的男孩子，买件上身外衣，在北京西单附近几家有童装的百货公司，零售商店几乎都找遍了，才买到一件较合适的制服样式的蓝色外衣。小孩刚一穿上非常高兴，可是第二天就不愿穿了，老说脖子疼。仔细检查了一下，发现衣服的领子和成年人的衣服一样，是一寸来宽的硬领，把孩子的脖子都磨红了。三、四岁的孩子怎能穿这种衣服呢？
    提起儿童的裤子来，做的更是别扭。特别是海军式的衣服，四、五岁孩子穿的和成年人衣服一样，是用皮带扎腰的裤子。腰带扎的稍为紧一些，小孩就会感到难受；松了呢，裤子老是往下掉。
    希望百货公司再做童装的时候，考虑到儿童的年龄和特点，做出适合他们穿的服装来。（秀峰）
    雨季里买不到雨鞋
    六月以来，河北省隆化县三天两头地下雨，可是在这里却买不到雨鞋。我曾到县城各个国营、公私合营百货部和合作社去买过，除了有几双不合脚的平口雨鞋和残鞋外，一双高腰的也没有，妇女和小孩穿的更难买到。
    希望赶快供给我们一些适用的雨鞋，不要再让我们感到在雨季里行路难。　（冀克祥）
    变色衬衣
    一月前，我在北京前门外妇女服装商店花了九块多钱买了一件浅蓝色新华呢衬衣。第二天我高高兴兴的穿上了这件新衬衣，没想到只
  是因为我在太阳下呆了较长的时间，这件新衣服就变成了不灰不白，带点儿红色的了，看起来好像是已经穿过几年的旧衣服。（黄淑芳）
　　盐场职工购货难
　　塘沽盐场距离塘沽市有二十来华里。盐场里的职工要买点东西都得到塘沽市去，往返一趟光走路就要花两个钟头。过去我们曾向商业部门提过意见，希望在盐场设立售货门市部，他们总是说：“盐场不能设‘点’，因为赚不了钱。”这样，盐场职工们要想买东西就非常不方便，特别是一些有家属同住的职工，买粮食、买油、买菜等都得跑到塘沽去买，一往一返，比干一天的活还累。
    商业部门应该替盐场的职工们解决这个困难问题，即使不能在盐场设立零售门市部，如果能组织一些流动售货的商贩来也要比现在好些。　　（邵在田）
    这是什么商业政策
    最近，我从河北宁河县到天津市文化用品公司去买胡琴，售货员说：“这里的东西只能卖给本市，不卖给外地来的。”我问为什么，他说这是“政策”。他还劝我到宁河县供销社去买。实际上我正是因为那里没有胡琴卖，才特地跑到天津来的。这时我灵机一动地说：“我就是天津市的，该卖了吧？”售货员说：“那就可以了。不过，这是政策，是你没有遵守政策。”当时我听了又好气、又好笑。我想，为什么从宁河到天津买东西就违反了政策，这是什么政策呢？		（刘继敏）
