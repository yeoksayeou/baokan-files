Xinhua News Agency, 8th. How to implement the policy of "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom" in academic journals? From the 2nd to the 5th, the editorial heads of 31 philosophy and social science academic journals held a symposium in Beijing to discuss this issue.

At the symposium, the editorial heads of various journals unanimously supported the policy of "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom". They believed that academic journals are the main venue for academic activities. To enable "a hundred schools" to "contend", first and foremost, there must be full academic freedom of discussion in academic journals. In the past, some journals had too many rigid rules in their manuscript selection process; some journals adopted simplistic and rude attitudes towards certain academic issues, restricting the free discussion of different opinions; some journals published critical articles that lacked a pragmatic and mutually exploratory spirit, being overly critical of those being criticized and even arbitrarily labeling them; some journals' editors did not give enough respect to authors' independent opinions when handling manuscripts; and some journals published many empty articles filled with dogmatic sentiments. All of these have greatly hindered the development of free academic discussion. In order to implement the policy of "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom", various academic journals must fully reflect the research results and opinions of academic workers in all fields in the future; reflect the different viewpoints of various schools in the relevant disciplines; encourage academic workers' theoretical courage and creativity; and for academic criticism, should advocate a reasonable, pragmatic, and mutually consultative attitude, combining ideological clarity and attitudinal humility in academic criticism. The boundary between academic issues and political issues should be clarified, and no critic should be allowed to arbitrarily label those being criticized with political labels in academic debates. Academic journals can publish idealist articles, and a materialist critique of idealist thought should be carried out through academic discussion methods, with freedom of criticism and counter-criticism. Academic journals should be run vigorously and strive to overcome dogmatism.

Regarding the issue of improving editorial work, the editorial heads of various journals participating in the symposium believed that: journal editors have the full right to modify and select or reject manuscripts, but must be very cautious when exercising this right. If it is necessary to modify a manuscript, the original views of the author must be respected, as well as their new theoretical insights and unique style in the article. For veteran experts with specialized knowledge, journal editors should establish close contact with them and rely on them to run the journals well. Young authors should be cherished, and journal editors should regard the discovery and cultivation of new forces as one of the important tasks in their work. If different opinions cannot be reconciled for the issues that are debated in the journal, there is no need to force a conclusion or uniformity.

Participants in the symposium also believed that academic journals should encourage academic workers to write articles that theoretically elaborate on national policies, and articles that offer opinions and criticisms on various specific measures or shortcomings in the country's policy implementation and work. Academic workers should care about state affairs and actively participate in national political life.

Some people at the symposium suggested that, in order to further guarantee academic democracy and freedom of academic discussion, the editorial boards of academic journals could be elected by relevant academic circles through correspondence elections in the future. This opinion was supported by the vast majority of attendees. They believed that this would not only be beneficial to the development of academic research work, but also can urge academic journals to be run better. The symposium also exchanged views on how to solve the current shortage of editorial staff, appropriately improve the material and political treatment of editorial staff, and strengthen the academic research work of editorial staff.

More than 50 people participated in the symposium, including the heads of the journals of 15 universities such as Peking University, Nankai University, Shandong University, and Sun Yat-sen University, and the editors-in-chief and deputy editors-in-chief of 16 academic journals and newspaper supplements such as "Philosophical Research", "Economic Research", and "Historical Research".

    学术刊物应有充分的学术讨论自由
    全国学术刊物编辑负责人员在北京举行座谈会讨论“百家争鸣”
    新华社8日讯　在学术刊物中如何贯彻“百家争鸣”的方针？全国三十一个哲学、社会科学学术刊物的编辑负责人二日到五日在北京举行座谈会，讨论了这个问题。
    座谈会上，各个刊物的编辑负责人一致拥护“百家争鸣”的方针。他们认为，学术刊物是学术活动的主要园地，要使“百家”能够“争鸣”起来，首先要在学术刊物上有充分的学术讨论自由。过去有的刊物在选稿工作中清规戒律太多；有的刊物对于一些学术问题，采取简单化的粗暴的态度，限制不同意见的自由讨论；有的刊物登载的批评文章，缺乏实事求是，互相探讨的精神，对被批评者挑剔过多甚至乱扣帽子；有的刊物的编辑人员在处理稿件时，对作者独立见解尊重不够；有的刊物发表了不少言之无物的充满教条主义气味的文章。所有这些，对于展开学术自由讨论都有很大妨碍。为了贯彻“百家争鸣”的方针，今后各种学术刊物必须充分地反映各方面学术工作者的研究成果和意见；反映各有关学科中各个学派的不同见解；鼓励学术工作者在理论上的勇气和创造性、对于学术上的批评，应该提倡讲道理、实事求是、互相商榷的态度，要使学术批评中思想上的明确性和态度上的谦逊相结合。划清学术问题和政治问题的界线，在学术论争中不允许任何批评者给被批评者乱扣政治帽子。学术刊物可以发表唯心主义的文章，应当采取学术讨论方法开展唯物主义对唯心主义思想的批判，有批评和反批评的自由。学术刊物应当要办得有生气，努力克服教条主义。
    关于改进编辑工作的问题，参加座谈会的各刊物的编辑负责人认为：刊物编辑对于来稿完全有修改取舍的权利，但在行使这个权利的时候，必须十分慎重，如果要修改稿件，必须尊重作者原来的见解，尊重他们在理论上新的见解和文章中的独特风格。对于学有专长的老专家，刊物编辑人员要和他们取得密切联系，依靠他们办好刊物。对于青年作者要多爱护，刊物的编辑人员应该把发现、培养新生力量作为工作中重要的任务之一。在刊物上展开讨论的问题，如果各方面的意见一时不能取得一致，不必勉强作出结论或强求一致。
    参加座谈会的人还认为，学术刊物应当鼓励学术工作者撰写从理论上阐述国家政策的文章、对国家在执行政策中的各种具体措施或工作中的缺点提出意见和批评的文章。学术工作者应当关心国事，积极参与国家政治生活。
    座谈会上有的人提出：为了进一步保证学术民主、学术讨论的自由，今后学术刊物的编辑委员会可以采取由有关学术界用通讯选举的办法产生。这个意见得到到会绝大多数人的拥护。他们认为这样不仅对开展学术研究工作有利，并且可以督促学术刊物办得更好。座谈会还就如何解决目前刊物编辑人力不足、适当提高编辑人员物质待遇和政治待遇、加强编辑人员学术研究工作等问题交换了意见。
    参加这次座谈会的有北京大学、南开大学、山东大学、中山大学等十五个高等学校学报负责人，“哲学研究”、“经济研究”、“历史研究”等十六个学术杂志和报纸副刊的主编、副主编共五十余人。
