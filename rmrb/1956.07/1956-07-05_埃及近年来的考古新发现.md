    Recent Archaeological Discoveries in Egypt

    Recently, Professor Fikri of Ancient Egyptian History and Oriental History at Cairo University, Egypt, gave a report on recent archaeological discoveries in Egypt at an academic symposium held at the Chinese Academy of Sciences. He said that according to news received on May 1st of this year, the Egyptian Antiquities Department discovered the tomb of Princess Pta-i-neferu, daughter of King Amenemhat III of the 12th Dynasty (circa 1840 BC), near the Hawara Pyramid in Fayyum. The tomb contained three silver bottles engraved with her name. The granite sarcophagus was intact and had never been opened; however, inside, there was nothing but water, bones, and a small amount of gold leaf.

    From 1951 to 1955, Professor Fikri led excavations near Dahshur for the Egyptian Antiquities Department, discovering temples and hundreds of reliefs and statues inside and around the Pyramid of Sneferu, and also discovered new corridors inside the "Bent Pyramid." Sneferu reigned around 2680 BC. He was the builder of the first true pyramid in Egypt and the father of King Khufu, the builder of the Great Pyramid. The study of his pyramids, reliefs, temples, statues, and other artifacts has increased our knowledge of general Egyptian culture, as well as the art and architecture of the Old Kingdom period of Egypt.

    In addition, excavations led by other archaeologists have also yielded great results. Excavation work at the tomb site of the first dynasty kings has continued since 1952. Some ancient tombs were discovered in both 1953 and 1954. The cultural relics unearthed here are of great importance for studying the history of the beginning of Egyptian civilization. In May 1954, near the Great Pyramid of Giza (built around 2640 BC), a large pit was discovered containing a buried funerary wooden boat, covered with stone slabs. One of the boats also contained the disassembled parts of another large boat, 30 meters long, as well as boat equipment such as sails and oars. Funerary wooden boats have been discovered before, but this time the discovered wooden boat is the largest, oldest, and also relatively well-preserved. In July 1954, a large stone tablet was discovered in Luxor, with thirty-eight lines of text describing the details of King Kamose's (1575 BC) war against the Hyksos invaders of Egypt for independence, which is an important source for the study of ancient Egyptian history.

    埃及近年来的考古新发现
    最近，埃及开罗大学埃及古代史和东方史教授费克里，在中国科学院召开的学术座谈会上，作了关于近年来埃及考古新发现的报告。他说，据本年五月一日传来的消息，埃及古迹部在法郁穆的豪瓦拉金字塔附近，发现了第十二朝国王门姆哈特三世（约公元前1840年）的女儿普塔一内夫罗公主的墓室。墓室中有三个刻着她的名字的银瓶。花岗岩的石椁是完整的，从未掀动过；但是，里面除了水、骨骸和少量的金叶以外，没有旁的东西。
    1951年至1955年，费克里教授为埃及古迹部在达赫舒尔附近领导发掘工作，在斯尼弗罗金字塔的内部和周围发现了庙宇和数以百计的浮雕和雕像，又发现了“弯角金字塔”内部的新的走廊。斯尼弗罗在位的时代约当公元前2680年。他是埃及第一个真正金字塔的建筑者，是大金字塔建筑者国王库夫的父亲。对于他的金字塔、浮雕、庙宇、雕像和其他器物的研究，使我们增加了关于一般埃及文化以及埃及古王朝时代的艺术和建筑的许多知识。
    此外，其他考古学家所领导的发掘也取得了很大的收获。第一朝国王墓地的发掘工作，自1952年起继续进行。1953和1954年都发现了一些古墓。这里出土的文物，对于研究埃及文明的开端的历史是非常重要的。1954年5月，在基最的大金字塔（建于公元前2640年左右）附近，发现了埋藏殉葬木船的大土坑，坑上盖着石板。有一只船中还放置着另一只长达三十公尺的大船的拆卸下来的各部分，以及船上的设备如帆、桨之类。这种殉葬木船以前也发现过，但是这次发现的木船最大最古，而且也相当完好。1954年7月，在卢克索发现了一块大石碑，碑上有文字三十八行，叙述国王卡莫斯（公元前1575年）反对侵略埃及的希克索斯人的独立的战争详情，这是研究埃及古代史的重要资料。
