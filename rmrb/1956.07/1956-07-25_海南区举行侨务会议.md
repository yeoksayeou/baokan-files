Xinhua News Agency, Haikou, July 24th: The Fourth Overseas Chinese Affairs Work Conference of the Hainan Region was held in Haikou City from the 16th to the 21st.

Yang Zejiang, Deputy Secretary of the Hainan Regional Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, said at the meeting that in order to fully mobilize the enthusiasm of returned overseas Chinese and their families in building socialism, key overseas Chinese counties must first consider the interests of returned overseas Chinese and their families when arranging all work, and listen to their opinions on the work.

When discussing the development of Hainan's tropical economic resources, Yang Zejiang particularly emphasized the important role of overseas Chinese and their families. He said: Overseas Chinese have extremely rich experience in planting tropical economic crops. Therefore, from the perspective of talent, technology, and capital, overseas Chinese and their families are an important force to rely on for the development of Hainan. Yang Zejiang also talked about the policy issues of incorporating some economic crops into cooperatives. He said that economic crops such as coconuts, pepper, and oil palm do not need to be incorporated into cooperatives; if returned overseas Chinese and their families have any objections to rubber plantations that have already been incorporated into cooperatives, they should be allowed to withdraw from the cooperatives. The incorporation of rubber plantations into cooperatives can only be considered on the basis of guaranteeing increased income for rubber farmers.

The meeting focused on conveying the resolutions of the Fourth Expanded Meeting of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission of the People's Republic of China and reviewing the implementation of overseas Chinese affairs policies in various counties of the Hainan Region. The meeting demanded a thorough resolution of outstanding legacy issues in various regions and new problems arising in agricultural cooperativization and made a decision to this effect.

    海南区举行侨务会议
    新华社海口24日电　海南区第四次侨务工作会议十六日到二十一日在海口市举行。
    中共海南区委员会副书记杨泽江在会上说，为了充分发挥归侨、侨眷建设社会主义的积极性，今后重点侨县在安排一切工作时，必须首先考虑归侨、侨眷的利益，倾听归侨、侨眷对工作的意见。
    杨泽江在谈到开发海南热带经济资源时，特别强调华侨、侨眷的重要作用，他说：华侨种植热带经济作物有极丰富的经验，因此，从人材、技术和资金方面看，华侨、侨眷是开发海南的一个重要的依靠力量。杨泽江还谈到一些经济作物入社的政策问题，他说，椰子、胡椒、油棕等经济作物都不必入社；胶园已经入社的，归侨和侨眷如有意见也应准予退社。只有在保证胶农增加收入的基础上才可以考虑胶园入社。
    会议着重传达了中华人民共和国华侨事务委员会召开的第四次侨务扩大会议的决议和检查了海南区各县贯彻执行侨务政策情况。会议要求彻底解决各地存在的遗留问题和在农业合作化中产生的新问题。并为此作出了决定。
