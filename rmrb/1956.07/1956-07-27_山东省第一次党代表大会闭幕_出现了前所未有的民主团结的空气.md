Xinhua News Agency, Qingdao, July 25th: At the recent First Congress of the Communist Party of China Shandong Province, an unprecedented atmosphere of democracy and unity emerged within the Shandong Party. The congress seriously criticized the abnormal democratic life within the Party, and the shortcomings and errors of subjectivism, bureaucracy, and commandism in the work of the leading organs. It demanded the improvement of the Party's leadership style, the establishment of a normal democratic life within the Party, the elimination of the fear of making mistakes and taking responsibility among some Party members and cadres, and the further promotion of initiative and creativity within the Party.

This congress was held in Qingdao City from July 12th to 22nd. The 975 delegates attending the congress represented more than 1.12 million Communist Party members in the province.

Before the official opening of the congress, a nine-day preparatory meeting was held, during which many criticisms and suggestions were made regarding the overestimation of achievements and insufficient self-criticism in the draft work report of the previous provincial party committee. The provincial party committee held a four-day enlarged meeting, and made two relatively significant revisions to the work report based on the opinions of the delegates.

During the congress, the delegates engaged in full discussions, with 66 people speaking and 101 people making written statements. The congress consistently implemented the spirit of promoting democracy and carrying out criticism and self-criticism. Many important issues were discussed and debated until a consensus was reached, reflecting the congress's principle of unity and setting a good example for the construction of Shandong's Party organizations. Many delegates reflected that this situation was unprecedented in the Shandong Party organization.

The congress believed that in the past two years, especially since the arrival of the upsurge of the socialist revolution, the economic foundation and social outlook of the entire province, both rural and urban, have been transformed, and the socialist economy has become the basic economic form within the province. Industrial and agricultural production have developed. At the same time, there have been significant gains in improving leadership style. Based on these circumstances, the congress determined that the central task for all levels of Party committees in the province in the future, both urban and rural, must be to develop industrial and agricultural production and comprehensively complete and overfulfill the first Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule. All other tasks must be centered on and serve this central task. At the same time, the task of socialist transformation must be thoroughly completed.

The congress pointed out that due to the provincial party committee's detachment from reality and the masses in its leadership, the existence of subjectivism, bureaucratic work style, and complacency, many concerns arose about the development of agricultural producers' cooperatives after the arrival of the upsurge of agricultural cooperation. It did not dare to let go, especially the development of advanced cooperatives, and failed to put forward appropriate plans in a timely manner, resulting in a continuous development situation that prolonged the development time and process. Many cooperatives could not be stabilized more quickly, which seriously affected the spring plowing production and consolidation work of the cooperatives, causing passivity in the work below. Conversely, in the agricultural production increase campaign and well-drilling campaign in the first half of this year, the requirements were too high, too urgent, and too rigid. Some agricultural technical measures were promoted rigidly, and numbers were assigned. On the issue of well-drilling, unrealistic demands such as "drilling 5 million wells" were blindly put forward. Delegates criticized that erroneous practices such as naming and ranking, urging numbers, requiring tasks, and claiming that organizational measures would be taken against those who could not complete the tasks in the reports, newspapers, and telephone conferences, increased the pressure on cadres below, resulting in phenomena such as assigning well-drilling numbers at all levels regardless of region or conditions, and pursuing quantity over quality. As a result, many wells were abandoned, the utilization rate was not high, there were many work-related injuries, a lot of manpower and material resources were wasted, and coercion and commandism were caused, arousing dissatisfaction among the masses. The delegates believed that the provincial party committee's hasty and rash sentiment of not proceeding from reality was also manifested in other aspects, and criticized the provincial party committee's past practice of making criticisms and accusations from top to bottom while the leaders could not humbly listen to the opinions of those below.

The congress pointed out that the emergence of these shortcomings and errors was due to the complacency of the provincial party committee leadership in the smooth progress of the overall work. They did not accept the historical lessons in the work of Shandong Province, and lacked comprehensive investigation and research and multi-faceted consultation and discussion.

The Party Congress particularly emphasized that attention should be paid to the fact that there are still abnormal situations in the Party's organizational life in Shandong Province. This situation is manifested in the fact that people from top to bottom and between each other cannot raise opinions without any concerns or see problems in leadership and work. The psychology of fearing mistakes and fearing responsibility in work still exists among many Party members and cadres, which has a certain impact on the Party's unity and limits the initiative and creativity of Party members and cadres. The congress analyzed the reasons for this abnormal situation. The congress proposed that in order to mobilize all positive forces to serve the socialist cause, the key lies in further strengthening the Party's unity, improving the Party's internal life, and establishing a normal democratic life.

The congress elected the new provincial party committee members and delegates to the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China. Before the election, the delegates repeatedly discussed and reviewed the list of candidates submitted to the congress by the congress presidium, made strict criticisms of the shortcomings and errors of some candidates, and requested the presidium to replace individual candidates. The presidium adopted the opinions of the delegates.

After supplementing opinions, the congress finally passed a resolution approving the work report of the previous provincial party committee.

    山东省第一次党代表大会闭幕
    出现了前所未有的民主团结的空气
    据新华社青岛25日电　在最近举行的中共山东省第一次代表大会上，出现了山东省党内前所未有的民主团结的空气。大会严肃地批评了党内民主生活不正常，领导机关工作中主观主义、官僚主义和命令主义等缺点和错误；要求改进党的领导作风，建立正常的党内民主生活，消除某些党员干部怕犯错误、怕负责任的心理，进一步发挥党内的积极性和创造性。
    这次大会从七月十二日到二十二日在青岛市举行。出席大会的975名代表，代表着全省一百一十二万多个共产党员。
    代表们正式开会以前，曾进行了九天的预备会，对前届省委工作报告（草案）中的成绩估计过高和自我批评差的地方提出了许多批评和建议，省委举行了四天的扩大会议，根据代表们提出的意见对工作报告作了两次比较重大的修改。
    大会过程中，代表们展开了充分的讨论，有六十六人发了言，101人作了书面发言。大会自始至终贯彻了发扬民主开展批评与自我批评的精神，许多重要问题经过讨论、争论达到了认识一致，体现了大会的团结方针，为山东党组织的建设树立了一个良好的榜样。许多代表反映说，这种情况在山东党组织来说是空前的。
    代表大会认为，近两年来特别是从社会主义革命高潮到来以后，全省整个农村和城市的经济基础与社会面貌已经改观，社会主义经济已经成为省内的基本经济形态。工业和农业生产有了发展。同时在改进领导作风方面也有重大的收获。根据这些情况，大会确定全省各级党委必须以发展工业和农业生产，全面的提前和超额完成第一个五年计划作为城市与农村今后的中心任务，其他各项工作都必须围绕这一中心任务来进行，并为中心任务服务。同时还要彻底完成社会主义改造任务。
    大会指出，由于省委领导上脱离实际、脱离群众，存在着主观主义、官僚主义的作风和麻痹自满情绪，因而在农业合作化高潮到来以后，对农业生产合作社的发展顾虑很多，不敢放手，特别是高级社的发展未能及时提出适当的规划，以致形成连续发展的状况，拉长了发展的时间与过程，使很多社不能较快的稳定下来，严重地影响到社的春耕生产和整顿巩固工作的进行，造成下边工作上的被动。相反地，在今年上半年的农业增产运动和打井运动中，则要求过高、过急、过死，硬性地推广某些农业技术措施和摊派数字。在打井问题上，盲目地提出“打五百万眼井”等不切合实际的要求。代表们批评说，由于在通报中、报纸上和电话会上采取了点名排队、催数字、要任务，并声言要对不能完成任务的人必要时进行组织处理等错误作法，增加了对下边干部的压力，造成了不分地区、不顾条件层层分配打井数字，只求数量不求质量等现象。结果废井很多，利用率不高，工伤事故不少，浪费了很多人力物力，造成强迫命令，引起群众不满。代表们认为省委领导上这种不从实际出发的急躁冒进情绪，还表现在其他方面，同时批评了省委领导过去自上而下的批评指责多，领导者不能虚心听取下边意见。
    大会指出这些缺点和错误的产生，是由于省委领导上在整个工作的顺利进展情况下，产生了麻痹自满情绪，没有接受山东省工作中的历史教训，缺少全面的调查研究和多方面请教商量的结果。
    党代表大会特别强调应该注意这样一种情况：目前在山东省党组织生活方面还存在着不正常的情况，这种情况表现在上下之间与互相之间有意见或者看到领导上和工作中的问题，不能毫无顾虑地提出来，工作上怕犯错误、怕负责任的心理在不少党员干部中依然存在，这就使党的团结受到一定的影响，党员干部的积极性与创造性的发挥受到一定的限制。大会分析了产生这种不正常情况的原因。大会提出要调动一切积极力量为社会主义事业服务，这个问题的关键在于进一步增强党的团结，改进党内生活状况，建立正常的民主生活。
    大会选出了新的省委委员和出席中共第八次全国代表大会的代表。在选举之前，代表们曾反复地讨论和审查了大会主席团提交给大会的候选人名单，对某些候选人的缺点和错误进行了严格的批评、并要求主席团调换个别候选人，主席团采纳了代表们的意见。
    大会最后经过补充意见后，通过决议，同意上届省委的工作报告。
