Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, July 13th: A message from Laos: The Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front, at its meeting on July 5th, issued a letter to all the Lao people, calling on them, regardless of party, religion, class, or ethnicity, to warmly respond to Prince Souphanouvong's statement of May 28th and unite as a strong whole to fight for the neutrality, democracy, and unity of the nation.

The appeal believes that Prince Souphanouvong's statement of May 28th on the issues of peace and unity in Laos is in line with the interests and aspirations of the Lao people and consistent with the development of the current domestic and world situation. The Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front fully approves and warmly responds to this statement.

The appeal pointed out that if Laos implements a policy of peaceful neutrality, it will be able to stop the interference of foreign reactionary forces, defend national independence and democracy, promote national economic prosperity and national unity, and enhance Laos' international standing, gaining more friends and the help of many countries. At the same time, it can also contribute to consolidating and expanding the Southeast Asian peace zone. The appeal believes that Cambodia, which has adopted a policy of peaceful neutrality, is a model for Laos.

The Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front hopes that the Lao Royal Government will resume political consultative conferences with the Lao Fighting Units and jointly seek ways to achieve the policy of peaceful neutrality that Prince Savang and Prime Minister Souvanna Phouma have also announced.
