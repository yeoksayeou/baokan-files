Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, July 24th: Guangzhou's financial departments are helping small vendors overcome current difficulties in business operations and living conditions.

    The Guangzhou State-owned Department Store, starting from July 16th, has expanded the price difference between wholesale and retail prices for fifteen major categories, totaling six hundred and thirty-nine types of small commodities, allowing small vendors to earn more profit. Previously, the wholesale-retail price difference for these goods was 14% to 20%; now it has been expanded to 17% to 25%. The State-owned Cultural Goods Company used to have a minimum consignment commission rate of only 7% for small vendors, and also divided miscellaneous goods into more than twenty categories, each with different commission rates, adding a lot of trouble to small vendors. Recently, based on the demands of small vendors, this company has abolished the different commission rates and uniformly increased them to 12%. When selling goods to small vendors, the State-owned Transportation Electrical Equipment Company, Department Store, and Cultural Goods Company have removed the minimum wholesale order requirement for most goods. No matter how much the small vendors want, they can buy them at wholesale prices. The supply of goods needed by small vendors has also received special attention. The State-owned Cultural Goods Company used to have many restrictions on the types of goods consigned by small vendors and often distributed slow-selling goods along with them. Now, it has changed to allowing consignment of all available goods, generally without restrictions. The Department Store previously rarely supplied small vendors with popular goods such as Shaochang soap and camphor balls. Now, it prioritizes supplying these to small vendors and is studying the possibility of allocating a portion of the assortment specifically for small vendors to operate.

    The Guangzhou Tax Bureau has also taken some measures to reduce the tax burden on small vendors. The Tax Bureau stipulates that small vendors with small household income, before the implementation of regular fixed-amount collection, will not be taxed on income tax if the monthly business income of each household is less than 250 yuan, or the business profit is less than 100 yuan, or the consignment commission is less than 50 yuan. All small vendors who previously used the democratic appraisal method for taxation and now do not meet the conditions for bookkeeping taxation shall be changed to assessed taxation, and the democratic appraisal method shall be abolished.

    The Guangzhou branch of the People's Bank of China has issued loans totaling more than 80,000 yuan to more than 460 small vendors who have financial difficulties in the past month. Now, the procedures for small vendors to obtain loans from banks are simplified. As long as they are reviewed by the responsible state-owned commercial departments, they can obtain loans. At the same time, they can use the purchased goods as collateral, eliminating the requirement to find a guarantor. The loan term has also been extended to one year in some cases.

    For a small number of households in difficulty that still cannot maintain their business after taking the above measures, the state-owned commercial departments have absorbed some of their personnel and made other arrangements for their work. So far, a total of 101 people have been absorbed, some of whom have become staff members of state-owned companies or joint state-private stores.

    广州市各财经部门
    帮助小商贩克服经营上的困难
    新华社广州24日电　广州市各财经部门正在帮助小商贩克服当前在经营上和生活上存在的一些困难。
    广州市国营百货公司从七月十六日起扩大了十五大类共六百三十九种小百货的批发价格和零售价格之间的价格差额，使小商贩能够多得一些利润。过去这些商品的批零差价是14％到20％；现在扩大为17％到25％。国营文化用品公司过去规定给小商贩的代销手续费率最低的只有7％，而且把零星商品划分成二十多类，每类手续费率不同，给小商贩增加不少麻烦。这个公司最近根据小商贩的要求，取消了不同的手续费率，把它统一提高为12％。国营交通电工器材公司、百货公司和文化用品公司在出售商品给小商贩时，对绝大部分商品取消了批发起点的规定，无论小商贩要多少，都可以按批发价格售给他们。小商贩所需要的货源也得到了特别照顾。国营文化用品公司过去对小商贩代销的品种有很多限制，并且经常配售滞销货，现在已经改为有货都给以代销，一般不加限制。百货公司过去很少供给小商贩的畅销货如绍昌皂和樟脑丸等，现在都优先供应小商贩，并且正在研究划出一部分品种，专门给小商贩经营。
    广州市税务局对减轻小商贩税收负担也采取了一些措施。税务局规定对小商贩的小型户所得税在没有实行定期定额征收以前，凡每户每月营业收入额不满二百五十元的，或营业收益额不满一百元的，或代销手续费不满五十元的，都不征所得税；凡是以前用民主评议方式征税的小商贩而现在又不具备查账征收条件的，一律改为核标征收，取消民主评议方式。
    中国人民银行广州分行，近一个月来共给四百六十多户资金有困难的小商贩发放了八万多元的贷款。现在小商贩向银行贷款手续简便，只要经过主管的国营商业部门审查以后就可以贷到，同时可以把购买进来的商品作保证，取消找保等规定，贷款期限有的也延长到一年。
    在采取上面这些措施帮助以后，还是不能维持的一小部分困难户，国营商业部门已经吸收它们的部分人员，另行安排他们的工作。到目前为止，共吸收了一百零一人，其中有些已经成为国营公司或公私合营商店的工作人员。
