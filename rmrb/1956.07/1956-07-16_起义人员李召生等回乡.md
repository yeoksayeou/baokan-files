Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, 15th. Insurgent personnel Li Zhaosheng and 23 others, who had defected from the Chiang army in Burma and were visiting and receiving medical treatment in Kunming, left Kunming today to return to their long-separated hometowns. In addition, two people are going to Beijing for a visit. They spent more than a month enjoying a happy life and receiving proper treatment in Kunming, and those who were sick have fully recovered their health.

On the afternoon of the 14th, the Chinese People's Liberation Army stationed in Kunming held a farewell meeting. At the meeting, Senior Colonel Zhou Zhengyi encouraged them to return to their hometowns and work with the people of all ethnic groups in the border areas to build the motherland. He also presented Li Zhaosheng and others with certificates of uprising, funds for returning home to engage in production and construction, and new bedding on behalf of the Yunnan Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army.

When Li Zhaosheng and others boarded the car this morning to leave Kunming, they smiled and said goodbye to the people who came to see them off.
