Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, July 28th: Jilin Province's counties recently conducted a detailed typical survey on the pre-distribution of autumn harvest in agricultural production cooperatives during the summer hoeing period. The survey shows that if there are no major natural disasters in the future, 90% of the members of many agricultural cooperatives will be able to increase their income; if we actively help the remaining 10% of the members organize sideline production and appropriately arrange farm work, it is also possible to prevent them from reducing their income or even increase their income. Jilin Province is now using every means to increase the income of its members.

Most agricultural cooperatives in Jilin Province will be able to increase production and income this year. According to a survey of thirty-two cooperatives, based on the current growth of crops and other production income, under normal conditions, the total production value of these cooperatives will increase by 10% to 50% compared with last year in fourteen cooperatives; it will increase by 50% to 70% compared with last year in eleven cooperatives; and it will increase by more than 70% in seven cooperatives. According to a survey of forty-one cooperatives, either by household or by selecting typical households, members' income can increase by more than 90% in thirty-two cooperatives; and more than 80% of the members in the remaining nine cooperatives will be able to increase their income. The reason why most of the cooperatives surveyed will be able to increase production and members will be able to increase income is that they have adopted many measures to increase production and strive to increase income, and on the other hand, they have eliminated waste and reduced production costs.

An investigation and study was also conducted on the issue of striving to ensure that the remaining 10% of members do not reduce their income and strive to increase it. According to the results of typical surveys in various regions, the reason why these 10% of members generally cannot increase their income is primarily because sideline production has decreased; secondly, after the cooperatives that originally planted paddy fields were merged into dry land cooperatives, the income of this group of members decreased; thirdly, the income of members with many livestock was also affected after the livestock became publicly owned; furthermore, the income of upper-middle peasants who originally had carts and horses, and who had previously had high incomes from carts, horses, and land, and good sideline conditions, has now decreased; in addition, a small number of poor peasants with weak labor forces and widowed or orphaned households cannot increase their income.

Based on the reasons for the decrease in income, various regions have proposed many good methods to avoid these members reducing their income and strive to increase it. Among them, the most important method is to actively organize household sideline production so that those with weak labor forces or upper-middle peasants who had many avenues for sideline production in the past can increase or guarantee that they do not reduce their income. Guangming Agricultural Cooperative in Qian'an County originally estimated that elderly member Liu Fengyang might reduce his income this year. Later, they found a way for him to engage in sideline production, letting him grow melons, which can earn him one hundred and seventy yuan a year, several times more than his income last year. Antu County has already organized more than six thousand members who may reduce their income to invest in sideline production such as forestry and animal husbandry.

For some members who still cannot guarantee to increase or not reduce their income even after engaging in sideline production, agricultural cooperatives in various regions have also arranged appropriate farm work for them, so that they have more labor opportunities in order to obtain more labor remuneration. Yu Deshui, an upper-middle peasant member of the Guangming Agricultural Production Cooperative in Qian'an County, used to raise a lot of livestock. After joining the cooperative, his income might decrease this year. The cooperative helped his family make a plan and mobilized the women to participate in production. According to the plan, his family only needs to work fifty more labor days to make up for the reduced income, and exceeding fifty labor days will increase their income. After planning, of the eleven member households that were originally estimated to have reduced income in this cooperative, six households can increase their income, and the income of the remaining five households will not be reduced much.

    用一切办法增加社员收入   
    吉林各县争取农业社90％的社员收入增多
    帮助其余10％的社员开辟增加收入的门路
    据新华社长春28日　电吉林省各县在最近夏锄期间作了一次细致的关于农业生产合作社秋收分配试分的典型调查，调查说明：今后如果没有较大的自然灾害，许多农业社90％的社员都能增加收入；如果积极帮助其余10％的社员组织副业生产和适当安排农活，也可能使他们不减少收入或者增加收入。现在吉林省正在用一切办法增加社员收入。
    吉林省大部分农业社今年都能增产增收。据三十二个社的调查，根据当前农作物生长情况和其他生产收入等计算，在正常年景的情况下，这些社的生产总值，比去年增加一成到五成的有十四个社；比去年增加五成到七成的有十一个社；增加七成以上的有七个社。另据四十一个社的逐户或选择典型户的调查，社员增加收入可占90％以上的有三十二个社；其余九个社80％以上的社员能够增加收入。所调查的这些合作社大部分将能够增产和社员能够增加收入的原因，是它们采取了很多的增产措施，争取增加收入，另一方面是它们消灭了浪费、降低了生产成本。
    对争取其余10％的社员不减少或者增加收入的问题，也进行了调查研究。根据各地典型调查的结果，这10％的社员一般不能增加收入的原因，首先是因为副业生产减少了；其次是原来种水田的社并入旱田社以后，这部分社员的收入减少了；再次是牲畜多的社员，牲畜公有后收入也受了影响；还有原来有车有马的上中农，过去车马、土地收入多、副业条件好，现在收入减少了；另外，少数劳动力弱的贫农和孤、寡户等也不能增加收入。
    根据减少收入的原因，各地都提出了许多避免这些社员减少收入并且争取增加收入的好办法。其中，最主要的办法是积极组织家庭副业生产，以便使劳动力弱的或是过去副业生产门路多的上中农等，都能增加或者保证不减少收入。乾安县光明农业社，原来估计年老的社员刘凤阳今年可能减少收入。后来找到了副业门路，让他种瓜，一年能收入一百七十元，比他去年的收入增加好几倍。安图县已经组织六千多名可能减少收入的社员投入了林、牧业等副业生产。
    对一些经营了副业生产还是不能保证增加或者不减少收入的社员，各地农业社又给他们安排了适当的农活，让他们有更多的劳动机会，以便取得较多的劳动报酬。乾安县光明农业生产合作社上中农社员于德水，过去养的牲口较多，入社后今年可能减少收入。合作社就帮助他家作了计划，发动妇女参加生产，根据计划，他家的人只要多作五十个劳动日就可以补上减少的收入，超过五十个劳动日就能增加收入。这个合作社经过规划，原来估计要减少收入的十一户社员，有六户反能增加收入，其余五户的收入也减少不多。
