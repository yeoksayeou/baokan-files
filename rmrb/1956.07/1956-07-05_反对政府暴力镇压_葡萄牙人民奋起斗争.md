Xinhua News Agency, 4th dispatch from Paris: The Portuguese people are extensively carrying out a struggle against the government's violent suppression. An article in a June issue of the French General Confederation of Labor's publication "People's Bi-Monthly" comprehensively reported on this situation.

The article, titled "Portugal Under Fascist Terror," stated that Portuguese workers have raised reasonable demands for higher wages and improved living conditions. However, the government has resorted to force and assassination to deal with the workers' movement.

In Porto, when male and female workers at the Texidos Aliança factory went on strike to oppose increased labor intensity, the political police broke into the factory, attempting to force the workers back to work. However, the workers defied all threats and intimidation, only returning to work after their demands were met. In Lisbon, the shipyard of the Onifável company was occupied by political and public security police, and machine guns were set up to force workers to work on May 1st.

In the countryside, an increasing number of peasants are rising up against the government's policies of hunger and low wages. In Vale de Vargo, Alentejo, over a thousand male and female peasants gathered in front of the GNR post, demanding the release of several peasant women who had been arrested for striking to demand higher wages. The GNR opened fire on the crowd. However, the masses, with courageous resistance, forced the GNR troops to hide in the post.

In the village of Baleizão, not far from Beja in southern Portugal, when over a thousand peasants tried to persuade peasants from neighboring areas not to work for lower wages, the GNR prevented the peasants from approaching each other. An officer shot and killed a pregnant woman holding a child, and also opened fire on some of the peasant women who were with her. Later, at the funeral of the deceased peasant woman, three thousand five hundred peasants engaged in a heroic struggle with the public security police and the GNR.

The working masses of Portugal are increasingly bravely carrying out the struggle against fascist suppression. In the city of Viana do Alentejo, residents stopped a vehicle transporting a worker arrested by the political police. In the city of Seixal, the GNR arrested three young people collecting signatures for peace, so around a thousand citizens held a demonstration near the GNR post, demanding the release of the arrested individuals, who were released that day. In many places, workers or peasants prevent the police from making arrests or searches, and the police often have to give way and slip away.

In many factories and villages, secret agents are openly exposed and despised by all residents.

Throughout Portugal, the movement demanding the release of the four members of the Central Committee of the National Democratic Association is expanding. These four people were arrested for advocating a peaceful resolution to the Goa issue.

    反对政府暴力镇压
    葡萄牙人民奋起斗争
    据新华社4日电　巴黎消息：葡萄牙人民正在广泛开展着反对政府暴力镇压的斗争。六月间一期法国总工会机关刊物“人民半月刊”里的一篇文章，综合报道了这方面的情况。
    这篇题目是“法西斯恐怖下的葡萄牙”的文章说，葡萄牙工人提出了提高工资和改善生活条件的合理要求。但是政府采取武力和暗杀的办法来对付工人运动。
    在波尔托，当特西多斯·阿里昂沙工厂的男女工人罢工反对加强劳动强度的时候，政治警察就闯进工厂，试图强迫工人复工。但是工人们不顾一切威胁和恐吓，直到他们要求得到满足以后才恢复工作。在里斯本，奥尼弗法贝利尔公司的造船厂曾被政治警察和公安警察占领，并且架设了机关枪，强迫工人在五月一日工作。
    在农村里，日益众多的农民在起来反抗政府的饥饿和低工资政策。在阿伦特若的瓦勒德瓦尔哥，一千多男女农民曾聚集在宪兵队派出所前面，要求释放因举行罢工要求增加工资而被捕的几个农妇。宪兵队向群众开枪。但是群众用勇敢的反抗迫使宪兵部队躲在派出所里。
    在葡萄牙南部距卑惹不远的巴勒热奥村，当一千多农民试图说服从邻近地方来的农民不要在更低的工资条件下工作时，宪兵队不许农民们互相接近，一个军官开枪打死了一个抱着小孩的孕妇，还向跟她在一起的一些农妇开枪。后来在安葬死难的农妇时，三千五百个农民又同公安警察和宪兵队进行了英勇的斗争。
    葡萄牙劳动群众正越来越勇敢地进行着反对法西斯镇压的斗争。在维纳德勒利亚市，居民拦住了押送一名被政治警察逮捕的工人的车辆。在塞沙尔市，宪兵队逮捕了三名征集和平签名的青年，于是一千来个市民就在宪兵队派出所附近举行示威，要求释放被捕者，他们在当天获释。在很多地方工人或农民等阻止警察进行逮捕或搜查，警察往往不得不让步溜走。
    在很多工厂和乡村里，密探被公开揭露，为全体居民所唾弃。
    在葡萄牙各地，要求释放全国民主协会中央委员会四个委员的运动，正在扩大着，这四个人是因为主张和平解决果阿问题而被捕的。
