    Electric Rammer
    (Our newspaper reports) Recently, the Northwest Textile Administration Engineering Company successfully trial-produced an electric rammer. This machine is very light. The ramming worker only needs to turn on the power button, and the rammer will automatically rise and fall to tamp the ground. One worker can tamp 240 square meters of ground in eight hours a day, which is equivalent to the workload of more than a dozen ordinary workers a day, and the quality is better than manual ramming. According to preliminary calculations, the use of electric rammers can reduce costs by more than 60% compared to manual ramming. The electric rammer also has a wide range of uses. It can tamp large areas of ground, and it can also tamp narrow trenches and tombs. (Li Qian)

    电动打夯机
    本报讯　最近西北纺织管理局工程公司试制成功了一种电动打夯机。这种机器很轻便，打夯工人只要把电钮一开，夯锤就自己一起一落地往地面上打，一个工人一天工作八小时可以夯实二百四十平方公尺的地面，顶十几个普通工一天的工作量，而且质量比人工打夯还要好。据初步计算，利用电动打夯机比人工打夯降低成本60％以上。电动打夯机的使用范围也很广，它可以在大面积的地坪上打夯，也可以把窄狭的沟槽和墓穴夯实。（李茜）
