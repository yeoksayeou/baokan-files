Xinhua News Agency Report: Recently, the Shantou Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party of Guangdong Province, based on the experiences and lessons of the early rice technical reform, put forward several specific requirements for the technical measures for cultivating late rice.

This year, in the planting of early rice, some areas of Shantou Prefecture blindly promoted single-seedling close planting regardless of soil and seedling strength, resulting in reduced production of early rice in some agricultural cooperatives. The Prefectural Committee believes that all localities should learn from these lessons and decide whether to plant single-seedling close planting or small-seedling close planting according to the soil quality and seedling strength. Therefore, before transplanting, each agricultural cooperative must specifically classify the soil.

When transplanting, it is required to ensure that the depth of transplanting, the size of the clumps, and the spacing between plants and rows are uniform, so that the seedlings can grow completely. For densely sown old seedlings that have already developed nodes, they should be deeply planted to prevent early lodging.

This year, the drainage and irrigation work in various places during the early season was done well, so the rice plants rarely lodged. The Prefectural Committee requires all agricultural cooperatives to continue to do a good job in drainage and irrigation for late rice. After transplanting, the paddy fields should be slightly deeply irrigated. After the seedlings turn green, shallow water irrigation within one and a half inches should generally be implemented, so that heat dissipation is fast at night and the soil temperature is low, which is beneficial to rice growth. In the late stage of rice tillering, drain the water once, and maintain shallow water irrigation until the rice ripens.

This year, the amount of fertilizer is generally insufficient in various places in Shantou Prefecture for late rice, so the Prefectural Committee believes that it is even more necessary to do a good job in rational fertilization. According to the characteristics of late rice's long growth period and the need for a continuous supply of fertilizer, the application of base fertilizer should be controlled. In addition to organic fertilizer as base fertilizer, decomposed human and animal manure, peanut cake, and chemical fertilizers should be used for topdressing and late-stage fertilizer. Different fertilizers must be applied to different soils during the application of base fertilizer and topdressing.

After these technical measures were put forward, all agricultural cooperatives in the region revised their late rice technical reform plans based on these requirements.

    接受早稻技术改革的经验教训
    汕头地委规定晚稻技术措施
    据新华社讯　最近，中共广东省汕头地委会根据早稻技术改革的经验教训，对栽培晚稻的技术措施提出了几项具体的要求。
    今年种植早稻，汕头专区某些地区不顾土壤和秧苗壮弱等条件，盲目推广单株密植，以致有些农业社的早稻减产。地委会认为各地应该记取这些教训，根据土壤好坏、秧苗壮弱来决定晚造插单株密植或插小株密植。因此在插秧之前，各农业社必须对土壤进行具体分类。
    在插秧时要求做到插秧深浅、科株大小一致和株行距离均匀，使秧苗生长齐全。对已经出节的密播老秧则要深插，以防早期倒伏。
    今年早造各地排灌工作做得较好，因此稻禾很少倒伏。地委会要求各农业社继续做好晚稻排灌水工作。在插秧后稻田略加深灌外，等禾苗回青后，一般应实行一寸半以内浅水灌溉，使夜间散热快，土温低有利水稻生长。在水稻分蘖后期，要排水一次，以后一直到稻禾黄熟都保持浅水灌溉。
    今年汕头专区各地晚造肥料普遍不足，因此，地委会认为更须做好合理施肥工作。根据晚稻生长期长，需要源源施放肥料的特点，在使用肥料时要控制基肥的施用，除有机质肥料作基肥外，腐熟人畜粪尿，花生麸和化学肥应用于追肥和壮尾肥。在施基肥及追肥中必须根据不同土壤施放不同肥料。
    这些技术措施提出后，全区各农业社都根据这些要求重新修订了晚稻技术改革计划。
