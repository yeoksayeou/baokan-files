Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 16th: News from Washington: On the early morning of July 14th, burning crosses were discovered planted in front of the residences of the Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court, Earl Warren, Supreme Court Justice Felix Frankfurter, and Deputy Attorney General Simon Sobeloff.

The cross planted in front of the apartment where Warren lived was a six-foot-tall wooden cross soaked in gasoline, and it was beginning to burn when discovered. The wooden cross in Frankfurter's yard was also smoking when discovered. The cross in front of Sobeloff's door, which was partially burned, was inscribed with "Sobeloff is a Jew."

On May 17, 1954, the U.S. Supreme Court made the decision to prohibit racial segregation in public schools. Warren and Frankfurter were both supporters of this decision. Sobeloff also expressed a relatively positive attitude in implementing this decision, which is why racists burned crosses in front of their homes.

Burning crosses late at night is originally a form of terrorist act by the American Ku Klux Klan. They often hold a "ceremony" of burning crosses before lynching or killing black people. But this time, the racists actually moved this terrorist activity to the front of the homes of senior officials in Washington, which is unusual. This matter has aroused widespread concern in the United States.

    美国种族主义者横行
    三K党在最高法院官员门前烧十字架
    新华社16日讯　华盛顿消息：七月十四日清晨，在美国最高法院首席法官埃尔·华伦、最高法院法官费利克斯·弗兰克福特和副总检查长西蒙·索贝洛夫的住所前面发现了被人栽上了燃烧着的十字架。
    栽在华伦所住的公寓前面的是一个六英尺高的浸透了汽油的木十字架，发现的时候正在开始燃烧。弗兰克福特院子内的木十字架在发现的时候也已经在冒烟了。索贝洛夫门前已经烧掉了一部分的十字架上写着“索贝洛夫是犹太人”。
    1954年5月17日，美国最高法院作出了在公立学校中不准实行种族隔离的决定。华伦和弗兰克福特都是支持这个决定的人。索贝洛夫在执行这个决定的时候也表示了比较积极的态度，这就是种族主义者要在他们门前烧十字架的原因。
    在深夜烧十字架本来是美国三K党徒的一种恐怖行为，他们在对黑人施行私刑或者杀害黑人之前，往往要举行烧十字架的“仪式”。但是这一次种族主义者居然把这种恐怖活动搬到华盛顿高级官员的门前来进行，这是异乎寻常的。目前这件事在美国已经引起了广泛的关切。
