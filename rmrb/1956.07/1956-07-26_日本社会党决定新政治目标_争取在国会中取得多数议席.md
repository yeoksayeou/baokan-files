Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 25th: The Japan Socialist Party decided on a new political struggle goal at a meeting of senior party leaders today: "Striving to achieve a completely independent majority of seats."

The meeting held that the Socialist Party's past slogan of striving for one-third of the seats had been realized. Therefore, in the second half of this year, the party will launch a large-scale offensive against conservative parties, striving to win a majority of seats in the Diet to achieve Japan's complete independence.

The meeting, which discussed the Socialist Party's action plan, decided that the main tasks of the Socialist Party's struggle in the future are: (1) to promote the national movement demanding the return of Okinawa; (2) to strive for the early restoration of diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union and China; (3) to oppose the militarization of Japan by the United States; (4) to oppose atomic and hydrogen bombs; (5) to oppose amending the current Constitution; and (6) to defend the people's livelihood.

According to Kyodo News, the Socialist Party will also formulate a realistic economic policy in mid-October this year, because the Socialist Party believes that the past economic policy was not realistic enough.

    日本社会党决定新政治目标
    争取在国会中取得多数议席
    新华社25日讯　东京消息：日本社会党今天在党的高级领导干部会议上决定新的政治斗争目标是“争取实现完全独立的过半数议席”。
    会议认为，社会党在过去提出的争取三分之一的议席的口号已经实现，所以今年下半年要向保守党派积极展开大规模的攻势，在国会中争取获得多数议席来实现日本的完全独立。
    这次讨论社会党活动方针的会议决定社会党今后的主要斗争任务是：（一）推进要求归还冲绳岛的国民运动；（二）争取早日同苏联和中国恢复外交关系；（三）反对美国把日本军事基地化；（四）反对原子弹和氢弹；（五）反对修改现行宪法；（六）保卫国民的生活。
    据共同社报道，社会党还要在今年十月中旬制定一个切合实际的经济政策，因为社会党认为过去的经济政策是不够现实的。
