Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 30th—In the first half of this year before “July 1st”, more than 5,700 new party members were admitted from among the workers in the industrial system of Shenyang, which is more than the total number of workers admitted to the Party in previous full years.

The reason why more workers were admitted to the Party than in previous years is that after the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and private industry and commerce across the country, the enthusiasm of workers in Shenyang to participate in industrial construction reached a new high. This construction enthusiasm is politically expressed as an urgent desire to become a vanguard fighter in building socialism - a member of the Communist Party of China.

The newly admitted workers are mostly those who play a pioneering role in industrial construction. According to a recent survey of 691 new party members, more than one-third of the new party members have won the titles of advanced producer or outstanding worker in creative labor.

This newspaper, Shanghai, 30th—In today's high tide of socialist revolution, the ranks of Shanghai local party organizations are stronger than ever. From July 1955 to the present, a total of more than 20,000 new party members have been admitted by party organizations at all levels in the city. New party members of worker composition account for the largest proportion of these new party members. More than 10,000 industrial workers in the industrial, basic construction, and transportation systems have joined the Party, of which more than 7,000 have been developed in the new joint state-private factories. Among handicraftsmen and stall vendors, many outstanding individuals have also been admitted to the Party. In the ranks of intellectuals, where the strength of the Party was previously relatively weak, a group of outstanding individuals has also been absorbed into the Party. In the first six months of this year, nearly 200 senior intellectuals were approved to join the Party. A group of faculty and staff members in primary and secondary schools throughout the city have also been admitted to the Party this year.

    沈阳上海工人成分的党员迅速增加
    据新华社沈阳30日电　沈阳市工业系统职工今年“七一”前的半年中新入党的就有五千七百多人，比过去每年全年入党的职工还要多。
    新入党职工比往年多的原因，是由于全国对农业、手工业和私人工商业进行社会主义改造后，沈阳市职工参加工业建设的热情出现了新高涨，这种建设热情表现在政治上就是迫切要求成为一个建设社会主义的先锋战士——中国共产党党员。
    新被吸收入党的职工大都是在工业建设中起先锋作用的分子。据最近对691个新党员的调查，其中三分之一以上的新党员在创造性的劳动中获得了先进生产者或优秀工作者的称号。
    本报上海30日电　在社会主义革命高潮的今天，上海地方党组织的队伍比过去更加壮大了。从1955年7月到目前一年中，全市各级党组织共接收了二万多名新党员。工人成分的新党员占这批新党员总数的最大比例，一共有一万多名工业、基本建设、交通运输等系统的产业职工加入了党的队伍，其中有七千多人是在新公私合营工厂中发展的。在手工业和摊贩中，也有不少优秀分子被吸收入党。在以往党的力量比较薄弱的知识分子队伍中，也吸收了一批优秀分子到党的队伍里来。在今年上半年的六个月里，被批准入党的高级知识分子将近二百名。全市中小学教职员中也有一批人在今年被分别接收入党。
