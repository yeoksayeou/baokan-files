　　As soon as you enter the courtyard of the Fang Jia Yuan kindergarten class, you hear the children's singing and laughter. The children are singing: "Mom and Dad went to work, Grandma sends me to kindergarten class, kindergarten class, so good, the teacher calls me a good baby..." The teacher says, "Children, who can sing by themselves?" One, two, many small hands are raised. Everyone is eager to sing first. Yang Jiaqiang, a five-year-old girl in a floral dress, sings "Little White Rabbit" while performing.

　　This is the children's free activity time. These are all children aged four to seven before school age. Every morning at eight o'clock, after the children arrive at the kindergarten class, they listen to the teacher tell stories, draw pictures, sing songs, play games, and learn the principles of how to be good children. At ten o'clock, the children are tired from playing, take a ten-minute break, and then wash their hands clean to prepare for a snack. The snack for this day is a piece of bread with white sugar and sesame paste.

　　At noon, the children in the morning class go home, and in the afternoon, the children in the afternoon class come here.

　　The director, deputy director, and teachers of the kindergarten are all housewives who are enthusiastic about children's welfare. Some have given up their own houses, some have donated savings to buy furniture, and some have donated toys and books. The deputy director also makes a delicious snack for the children every other day. They only charge each child 50 cents for snacks and one yuan for miscellaneous expenses per month. Every day, every day, they have to devote their labor to the children. (Attached picture)

    为了孩子
    一走进芳嘉园幼儿班的院落，就听见孩子们的歌声和嘻笑声。孩子们唱着：“爸爸妈妈上了班，奶奶送我幼儿班，幼儿班，真真好，老师叫我好宝宝……”老师说：“小朋友谁会自己唱歌？”一只，二只，许多只小手都举起来了。都争着要先唱。穿花裙衣的五岁小女孩杨家强一面唱着“小白兔”，一面还表演着。
    这个时候正是孩子们自由活动的时候。这些都是四周岁到七岁学龄以前的儿童。每天早上八点，孩子们来到幼儿班以后，就听老师讲故事，画画，唱歌做游戏，学些怎样做个好孩子的道理。十点钟，孩子们玩累了，休息十分钟，然后，把手洗干净，准备吃点心。这一天的点心是一片面包夹白糖和芝麻酱。
    中午，上午班的孩子们回家去了，下午又有下午班的孩子来到这里。
    幼儿园的主任、副主任和老师，都是热心儿童福利事业的家庭妇女。她们有的让出了自己的住房，有的捐出积蓄买家具，有的赠送玩具和图书。副主任还隔一天给孩子们做一次好吃的点心。一个月她们只收一个孩子五角钱的点心费和一块钱的杂费。每天，每天，她们都要为孩子们付出她们的劳动。（附图片）
