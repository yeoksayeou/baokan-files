Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, 9th -- The Huohua (Spark) Agricultural Cooperative in Dazhai Township, Longxi County, Fujian Province, has implemented an overproduction award system in its summer pre-distribution, which has powerfully promoted current production.

The Huohua Agricultural Cooperative has a total of eleven production teams. Because the cooperative implemented contracting output to work groups, the labor enthusiasm of the members of each team was very high. By the time of the summer harvest, the agricultural and sideline production of each team had exceeded the contracted output quota, resulting in an unprecedented bumper harvest. The total summer income of the cooperative reached more than 136,200 yuan, an increase of more than two times compared with last year.

During the first trial distribution, the cooperative saw that each team had overproduced, so it did not implement overproduction awards on a team-by-team basis. Each team distributed income based on the number of workdays completed. However, the amount of overproduction varied from team to team. As a result, the eleventh production team, which actively promoted advanced technology and overproduced more than 24,400 catties of grain, and the tenth production team, which had poorer production techniques and overproduced more than 9,500 catties, received the same amount of labor remuneration. This affected the unity between the teams and the enthusiasm of the members to improve farming techniques and increase labor efficiency.

Later, this unreasonable distribution method was replaced by an overproduction award system. The cooperative first extracted 60% of the overproduction of each team as an overproduction bonus to be distributed by each team according to the number of workdays of the members in the team. In this way, those production teams and members who worked well and increased production more were rewarded, thus encouraging the labor enthusiasm of the members. Now, a upsurge of improving farming techniques and striving for an autumn harvest has been set off within the cooperative. Up to now, the various types of farmyard manure accumulated by the cooperative have increased by more than one times compared with the same period last year, and the transplanting of more than 3,400 mu of double-cropping late rice in the cooperative has also started half a month earlier than last year.

### 鼓励社员努力劳动  火花农业社实行超产奖励

    鼓励社员努力劳动
    火花农业社实行超产奖励
    新华社福州9日电　福建省龙溪县大寨乡火花农业社，在夏季预分中实行超产奖励办法，有力地推动了当前生产。
    火花农业社共有十一个生产队，因为实行了包工包产，各队社员的劳动热情都很高，到夏收的时候，各队农副业生产都超过了包产定额，获得了空前丰收。全社夏季总收入共达十三万六千二百多元，比去年增加两倍以上。
    这个社在第一次试分时，因为看到各队都超产了，没有以队为单位实行超额奖励，各队都根据包工的劳动日数分得收益。但是，各队超产的数量有多有少，结果积极推广先进技术、超产谷子两万四千四百多斤的第十一生产队和改进生产技术较差、超产九千五百多斤的第十生产队的社员，劳动报酬都一样多，因而影响了队与队之间的团结和社员改进耕作技术、提高劳动效率的积极性。
    后来这种不合理的分配办法，为超产奖励制度代替了。社里首先抽出各队超产部分的60％给各队作为超产奖励金，由各队按队里社员出工数分配。这样，就使那些劳动好、增产多的生产队和社员得到奖励，因此，鼓舞了社员的劳动积极性。现在，社内已经掀起了一个改进耕作技术、争取秋季丰收的热潮。到目前止，全社所积各种农家肥料比去年同期增加一倍以上，全社三千四百多亩双季晚稻的插秧工作也比去年提前半个月开始。
