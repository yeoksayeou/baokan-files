Xinhua News Agency, Changchun. As the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant transitions to full-scale production, nearly nine thousand employees have been promoted and upgraded. Among them, over seven hundred are newly promoted management personnel above the rank of foreman, and more than fifty technicians have been promoted to engineers.

The promotion and upgrading of a large number of employees plays a significant role in improving the organizational structure of this newly built factory. At present, the 1,200 leading cadres above the rank of foreman required for full-scale production have been fully equipped. The remaining 170 or so engineers will also be supplemented from the existing technical personnel within the factory in August and September.

The majority of these newly promoted and upgraded production workers, engineering technicians, and management personnel have undergone business and technical studies through various methods, such as overseas internships, training in factories across the country, cultural and technical studies organized within the factory, and professional study classes. They have also been tempered through practical experience in various stages of factory production preparation and production adjustment. Therefore, they have all initially mastered the advanced Soviet automobile production technology and management methods.

    第一汽车厂九千名职工升级
    全厂一千二百名领导骨干配备齐全
    据新华社长春讯　正在向全面开工生产过渡的第一汽车制造厂，已经有近九千名职工得到了晋级和提拔。其中，光是新提拔的工长以上的管理人员，就有七百多人，还有五十多名技术员被提升为工程师。
    大批职工的被提拔和晋级，对健全这个新建工厂的组织机构，有极大的作用。目前全厂开工生产需要的一千二百名工长以上的领导骨干，已经配备齐全。还缺的一百七十多名工程师，也将在八、九月份从厂内现有技术人员中提升补齐。
    这批新提拔和晋级的生产工人、工程技术人员和管理人员，绝大部分都曾经经过出国实习、各地工厂的培养训练、厂内组织的文化技术学习和专业学习班等各种不同的方法，进行了业务和技术学习；在工厂生产准备、生产调整等各个阶段，他们又经过了实际锻炼。因此，他们都已经初步掌握了苏联先进的汽车生产技术和管理方法。
