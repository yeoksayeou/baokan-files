Xinhua News Agency, July 7th, Rome dispatch: Three million Italian agricultural workers began a 48-hour general strike on July 6th to protest the farmers' refusal to meet their demands for improved living conditions. The strike was called by the three major agricultural workers' unions led by the Italian Communist Party, the Christian Democratic Party, and the Social Democratic Party, respectively.

This strike is the third large-scale demonstration by Italian agricultural workers in less than a month. For a long time, Italian farmers have stubbornly refused to improve the living conditions of workers. Therefore, Italian agricultural workers have had to intensify their struggle.

The Italian government authorities attempted to suppress the demands of agricultural workers by high-handed means. Before the start of the strike, they dispatched a large number of police to various agricultural areas to intimidate workers who were preparing for the strike. On July 6th, a large number of striking workers were arrested.

    抗议农场主拒绝改善生活条件
    意大利三百万农业工人总罢工
    新华社7日讯　罗马消息：意大利三百万农业工人从七月六日起开始四十八小时的总罢工，抗议农场主拒绝他们提出的改善生活条件的要求。罢工是在分别在由意大利共产党、天主教民主党和社会民主党领导的三大农业工人工会的号召下进行的。
    这次罢工，是意大利农业工人在不到一个月时间里的第三次大规模示威行动，长时期以来，意大利的农场主一直顽固地拒绝改善工人生活的要求。因此，意大利的农业工人不得不再接再厉地进行斗争。
    意大利政府当局企图以高压手段来压制农业工人的要求，在这次罢工开始以前，就调派了大批警察前往各农业地区，对酝酿罢工的工人进行恫吓。七月六日又有大批罢工工人被逮捕。
