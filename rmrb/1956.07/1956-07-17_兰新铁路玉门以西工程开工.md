(Our newspaper's dispatch from Lanzhou, July 14th) Construction has begun on the section of the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway west of Yumen. Currently, over 10,000 railway workers are working intensely on the trunk line, stretching approximately 230 kilometers from Yumen East Station to Anxi Gorge East Station. As of July 9th, a brand new roadbed, about 20 kilometers long from Yumen to Huoshaogou, has been completely built; the earth and stone work for the roadbed west of Huoshaogou has also completed more than 200,000 cubic meters. A newly built transportation access road, about 60 kilometers long along the line, has already begun to serve the project.

The Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway line west of Yumen passes through sparsely populated villages and towns, with significant climate variations and complex geological conditions, making construction relatively difficult. However, with the active efforts of the workers and the enthusiastic support of the farmers along the line, the project is progressing rapidly.

    兰新铁路玉门以西工程开工
    本报兰州14日电　兰新铁路玉门以西的工程已经开工。目前，一万多名铁路工人正在从玉门东站到安西峡东站长约二百三十公里的干线上紧张施工。截至七月九日，玉门到火烧沟长约二十多公里的一条崭新路基，已经全部修筑起来；火烧沟以西的路基土石方工程，也完成了二十多万方。沿线新修的一条约六十公里长的运输便道，已经开始为工程服务。
    兰新铁路玉门以西的线路，沿途村镇稀少，气候变化很大，地质情况也很复杂，施工比较困难。但是在工人的积极努力和沿线农民的热情支援下，工程进展很快。
