Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang -- The reconstruction project of the Shenyang Cable Factory (formerly known as the Shenyang Wire Factory) is nearing completion, and all the newly installed equipment has comprehensively begun trial production. The three main workshops that started trial production first—bare wire, electromagnetic wire, and daily necessities—have already produced more than 3,200 tons of products such as steel-cored aluminum stranded wire, bare copper single wire, bare copper stranded wire, cellophane-wrapped wire, and yarn-wrapped wire. These products have been supplied to construction units in Wuhan, Changchun, Baotou, Chongqing, Luoyang, Anshan, and other places.

The reconstruction of the Shenyang Cable Factory began in July 1953. During the reconstruction process, the factory installed more than 1,500 new machines. After the completion of the reconstruction, it can produce more than 30 kinds of cables and wires. The annual output will increase six times compared to before the reconstruction.
