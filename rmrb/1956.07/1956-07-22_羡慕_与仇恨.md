“Envy” and Hatred
—International Notes—

    The "Wall Street Journal" recently reported that the total investment of the Arabian American Oil Company (ARAMCO), opened by American monopoly capital in Saudi Arabia, has reached $750 million, making it one of the largest American investments abroad. However, in the past year alone, ARAMCO earned a net profit of $540 million. According to the "Wall Street Journal," ARAMCO has found that its highly profitable business is both "envied and hated."
    Who envies it? Who hates it?
    According to the "Wall Street Journal," it seems that other Arab countries and the people of Saudi Arabia "envy" it. This is because the Saudi Arabian government is said to receive half of ARAMCO's profits annually. Also, it is said that ARAMCO has launched large-scale so-called "charitable undertakings" in order to "be loved," to the point where this company, which sucks the fat from the people of Saudi Arabia, can be called a "welfare institution."
    However, just by looking at the actual situation, one can know that the feelings of the Saudi Arabian people towards ARAMCO are by no means "envy."
    Saudi Arabia is a major oil-producing country in the Middle East. According to a 1954 estimate, its oil reserves are close to five billion tons, ranking first in the capitalist world. Since 1933, such abundant resources have fallen into the hands of the American Rockefeller monopoly group. For more than twenty years, ARAMCO and its predecessor, Arabian Mobil Oil Company, have plundered a large amount of oil from Saudi Arabia and earned astronomical profits. ARAMCO's annual profit is seven times its production cost. According to the company itself, this is because the Saudi Arabian oil fields are close to the surface and the production cost is low. However, a more important reason is its brutal exploitation of Saudi Arabian workers. Because the wages of Saudi Arabian workers are extremely low, the production cost of one ton of oil in the United States is twelve US dollars, while in Saudi Arabia it is less than seventy cents. Saudi Arabian workers have to work more than twelve hours a day for meager wages that cannot even maintain the minimum standard of poverty, with only eight days of rest a year. They live in dirty, simple huts. Poor nutrition and lack of medical services affect their health. The vast majority of workers cannot read or write. Moreover, because oil resources have been ruthlessly plundered by American monopoly capital, Saudi Arabia cannot use this resource to improve its backward economic situation and the lives of its people, and is thus trapped in terrible poverty.
    The people of Saudi Arabia know that it is ARAMCO that has brought them poverty and suffering instead of happiness with their huge oil resources. Facing the increasingly awakened people of Saudi Arabia, ARAMCO attempts to use a negligible portion of the fat it has sucked to buy the "love" of the Saudi Arabian people and maintain its exploitation and plunder of the Saudi Arabian people and resources. However, this plan is doomed to failure. The people of Saudi Arabia do not "envy" ARAMCO, but only hate it.
    Moreover, hatred comes not only from the Saudi Arabian people, but also from other imperialist monopoly groups. The "Wall Street Journal" admits that "using the word hatred" to describe the attitude of many British people towards ARAMCO "does not seem to be too strong." This is not difficult to understand. The United States is expanding its influence in the Middle East, which harms the interests of Britain. A fierce life-and-death struggle is underway between American and British monopoly groups for oil resources.
    Hatred, hatred, this is the only response that American monopoly capital can encounter in this world. (Ding) (Attached picture)

    “羡慕”与仇恨
    ——国际札记——
    “华尔街日报”最近报道说，美国垄断资本在沙特阿拉伯开设的阿（拉伯）美（国）石油公司在中东的投资，总数已达七亿五千万美元，是美国在国外投资企业中数一数二的一个。可是仅仅去年一年，阿美石油公司就获得净利五亿四千万美元。据“华尔街日报”说，阿美石油公司发现，它这个一本万利的生意既“受人羡慕也受人仇恨。”
    谁羡慕呢？谁仇恨呢？
    照“华尔街日报”的文章看来，“羡慕”的似乎是其他阿拉伯国家和沙特阿拉伯的人民。因为，据说，沙特阿拉伯政府每年得到了阿美石油公司的利润的一半。还因为，据说，阿美石油公司为了“要受人爱戴”而举办了大规模的所谓“慈善事业”，以至于这个吮吸沙特阿拉伯人民脂膏的公司可以被称为一个“福利机构”。
    但是，只要看一看实际情况，就可以知道沙特阿拉伯人民对阿美石油公司的感情决不是什么“羡慕”。
    沙特阿拉伯是中东盛产石油的国家，根据1954年估计，它的石油储藏量近五十亿吨，占资本主义世界的首位。从1933年起，这样丰富的资源就落到了美国洛克菲勒垄断集团的手里。二十多年来，阿美石油公司和它的前身阿拉伯美孚油公司已经掠夺了沙特阿拉伯的大量石油，赚取了天文数字的利润。阿美石油公司每年所赚的利润为其生产成本的七倍。据它自己说，这是因为沙特阿拉伯油田靠近地层表面，生产成本低。但是，更重要的原因是它对沙特阿拉伯工人的残酷剥削。由于沙特阿拉伯工人的工资极低，因此在美国一吨石油生产成本是十二美元，而在沙特阿拉伯还不到七角。沙特阿拉伯工人为了微不足道的、甚至不能维持最低贫困生活的工资，每天要工作十二小时以上，一年只有八天的休息。他们住在肮脏、简陋的小屋里。恶劣的营养和医疗服务的缺乏，影响了他们的健康。绝大多数的工人都不能阅读和写作。而且，由于石油资源遭到美国垄断资本的无情掠夺，沙特阿拉伯无法利用这个资源来改善它的经济落后的状况和人民的生活，因而陷于可怕的贫困。
    沙特阿拉伯人民知道，正是阿美石油公司使得他们的巨大的石油资源带给他们的不是幸福而是贫困和苦难。阿美石油公司面对着日益觉醒的沙特阿拉伯人民，企图用吮吸来的脂膏中的微不足道的一部分来收买沙特阿拉伯人民的“爱戴”，维持自己对沙特阿拉伯人民和资源的剥削和掠夺。但是，这种打算是注定了要失败的。沙特阿拉伯人民对阿美石油公司有的不是“羡慕”，而只是仇恨。
    而且，仇恨不仅来自沙特阿拉伯人民，还来自其他的帝国主义垄断集团。“华尔街日报”承认，“用仇恨这个字眼”来形容许多英国人对阿美石油公司的态度“似乎是并不过分强烈的”。这是不难理解的。美国在中东扩张它的势力，损害了英国的利益。美、英垄断集团之间为了争夺石油资源正在进行着尖锐的你死我活的斗争。
    仇恨，仇恨，这就是美国垄断资本在这个世界上所能遇到的唯一的回应。　　　　　　　（丁）（附图片）
