Xinhua News Agency Report: More than two hundred bolts of worsted gabardine produced by the state-owned Northwest Fourth Cotton Textile Factory have been shipped from Xi'an to Lanzhou and Wuwei in Gansu Province. This batch of worsted gabardine is the first high-grade cotton fabric produced by the Northwest cotton textile industry.

This batch of worsted gabardine, successfully trial-produced by the state-owned Northwest Fourth Cotton Textile Factory in June, has been dyed at the New Northwest Printing and Dyeing Factory into two varieties, Phthalamine and An'an blue, in both dark and light shades, meeting national standards in color and quality.

Currently, the state-owned Northwest Fourth Cotton Textile Factory has begun mass production of this gabardine and has added a black variety. The state-owned Northwest Third Cotton Textile Factory and Fifth Cotton Textile Factory will also trial-produce new products such as yarn khaki drill and yarn sateen this year to further meet the needs of the people of Northwest China for high-grade cotton fabrics.
