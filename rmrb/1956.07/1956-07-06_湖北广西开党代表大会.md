Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, July 4th: The First Congress of the Chinese Communist Party Hubei Province, which began on June 25th, closed this afternoon. The meeting adopted the Comprehensive Plan (Draft) for the Development of Agriculture in Hubei Province from 1956 to 1967 and the Main Points (Draft) of the Comprehensive Plan for Agriculture and Transportation Enterprises in Hubei Region. Wang Renzhong and thirty-six others were elected as new members of the Provincial Party Committee, and fourteen alternate members were elected. Twenty-seven delegates and two alternate delegates were elected to attend the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China.

    The industrial plan adopted by the meeting requires all factories and mining enterprises to strive to complete the first five-year plan ahead of schedule, and requires all possible units to strive to double productivity in seven to twelve years. For key construction projects built by the state in Hubei, they should be completed as early as possible and put into production on the condition of ensuring quality. The agricultural plan requires that the entire province basically completes the advanced form of agricultural cooperation before October this year, with about 90% of farmers participating in advanced cooperatives. The grain yield will be 440 jin per mu on average in 1956 and 850 jin per mu in 1967. The total fresh fish production in the province will reach 300 million jin this year, and it will reach 2 billion jin in 1967.

    During the discussion, in addition to affirming the achievements of the past work led by the Provincial Party Committee, the representatives also criticized the shortcomings in the work of the Provincial Party Committee. The representatives believed that the purchase prices of certain agricultural products were not reasonably set, the grain supply was somewhat tight, the pig feed problem was not well resolved, there was a lack of serious concern for the lives of workers and staff in industrial and mining enterprises and schools, a lack of care for teachers and staff, and insufficient attention to the personal interests of the masses. Many representatives from rural areas believed that the Provincial Party Committee did not seriously adhere to the method of typical demonstration and gradual promotion in promoting japonica rice this year, which resulted in a reduction in the yield of some japonica rice this year.

    Wang Renzhong, on behalf of the presidium of the congress, made a summary at the closing meeting. He believed that the emergence of these shortcomings was generally due to the bureaucracy and subjectivism of the Provincial Party Committee's leadership and the commandism in the implementation by lower levels resulting therefrom. Therefore, he called on the representatives to re-study Comrade Mao Zedong's report on the Yan'an Rectification Campaign and Comrade Liu Shaoqi's book "On the Party".

    Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, July 4th: The First Congress of the Chinese Communist Party Guangxi Province was held in Nanning City from June 21st to July 3rd.

    More than 500 representatives from all parts of Guangxi and from various ethnic groups listened to the report "The Main Situation and Tasks of Industrial and Agricultural Production in the Province in 1956" made by Chen Manyuan, Secretary of the Guangxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, on behalf of the Provincial Party Committee. The representatives were satisfied with the implementation of the policy of "healthy development and ensuring quality" in the agricultural cooperation movement. The representatives unanimously believed that the proposal in the report to mobilize the masses of the province to complete the agricultural production increase plan, implement reasonable distribution, and require agricultural cooperatives to distribute 65% to 70% of the total annual income to the members to strive for increased production and income for 90% of the members is very important and must be resolutely implemented. In terms of industrial construction, the report analyzed that due to the development of national socialist construction, the economic characteristics of Guangxi's subtropical region, and the rich underground resources, Guangxi Province's industrial construction tasks are becoming increasingly heavy. During the second five-year plan period, Guangxi will be one of the key points and bases of national industrial construction. Many industrial construction projects should immediately begin planning, surveying, site selection, design, and other work from now on.

    During the discussion, in addition to affirming the great achievements in socialist transformation and socialist construction, the representatives also criticized many shortcomings and errors in their work, such as the blindly increased grain production targets in the anti-Rightist sentiment after agricultural cooperativization in various places; in arranging current agricultural production, they only focused on grain production while relaxing economic crops and sideline production, resulting in the failure to complete the province's planting plans for various economic crops in the first half of the year, and the sideline income of many agricultural cooperatives was reduced compared with the same period last year; after the construction of agricultural cooperatives in various places, there was a serious phenomenon of extravagance and waste for a time, excessive non-productive expenditures of various cooperatives, and an excessive emphasis on the collective interests of the members while ignoring the personal interests, and other biases.

    After repeated discussions, the meeting decided to revise the province's original plan to increase grain production by 30% this year to 20%. The meeting required the adoption of various agricultural measures to ensure the completion of this task and to ensure increased production and income for the members.

    At the end of the conference, a new committee and alternate committee members of the Chinese Communist Party Guangxi Provincial Committee, totaling forty-six people, were elected, and representatives and alternate representatives to the Party's Eighth National Congress, totaling twenty-two people, were elected.

    湖北广西开党代表大会
    据新华社武汉4日电　六月二十五日开始的中国共产党湖北省第一次代表大会已经在今天下午闭幕。会议通过了1956年到1967年湖北省发展农业的全面规划（草案）和湖北地区农业、交通运输企业工作全面规划要点（草案），选出王任重等三十七人为新的省委委员和十四个候补委员，选举了出席中共第八次全国代表大会的二十七个代表和两个候补代表。
    会议通过的工业规划要求各厂矿企业努力争取提前完成第一个五年计划，要求一切可能的单位努力争取在七年到十二年内使生产率提高一倍左右，对于国家在湖北地区兴建的重点建设工程，应当在保证质量的条件下，争取提早建成，投入生产。农业规划要求今年十月份以前，全省基本上完成高级形式的农业合作化，参加高级社的农户达到90％左右。粮食产量，1956年平均每亩四百四十斤，1967年达到八百五十斤。今年全省的鲜鱼产量达到三亿斤，1967年要达到二十亿斤。
    在讨论中，代表们除肯定了过去省委领导工作的成绩以外，还对省委工作中的缺点进行了批评。代表们认为某些农产品的收购价格规定得不够合理，粮食供应上有些偏紧，生猪饲料没有很好解决，没有认真执行养猪户自留肉，对工矿企业、学校职工、教职员的生活缺乏认真的关怀和对群众的个人利益照顾不够等。许多农村来的代表认为省委今年在推广粳稻上没有认真坚持典型示范、逐步推广的办法，使今年有些粳稻减产。
    王任重代表大会主席团在闭幕会上作了总结。他认为这些缺点的产生总起来说是由于省委领导上的官僚主义、主观主义和由此而产生的下级执行中的强迫命令。因此，他号召代表们重新学习毛泽东同志延安整风的报告和刘少奇同志的“论党”一书。
    据新华社南宁4日电　中国共产党广西省第一次代表大会六月二十一日至七月三日在南宁市召开。
    来自广西各地、各民族的五百多位代表，在会上听取了中共广西省委员会书记陈漫远代表省委作的“1956年全省工、农业生产的主要情况和任务”的报告。代表们对于在农业合作化运动中贯彻“健康发展，保证质量”的方针感到满意。对报告中提出的动员全省群众完成农业增产计划，实行合理分配，要求农业社把全年总收入的65％至70％分配给社员，争取90％的社员增产增收，代表一致认为是十分重要的，必须坚决努力，贯彻执行。在工业建设方面，报告分析了由于国家社会主义建设的发展，广西亚热带地区多种经济的特点以及蕴藏丰富的地下资源，广西省工业建设任务日益繁重，在第二个五年计划期间，广西将是全国工业建设的重点和基地之一。许多工业建设项目从现在开始就要立即进行计划、勘测、选厂、设计等工作。
    代表们在讨论中，除肯定了在社会主义改造和社会主义建设中的巨大成就，还批判了许多工作中的缺点和错误，例如农业合作化后各地在反右倾的情绪下，盲目提高粮食增产指标；在安排当前农业生产中，只抓紧粮食生产而放松了经济作物和副业生产，致使全省上半年各项经济作物播种计划没有完成，很多农业社的副业收入比去年同期减少；各地农业社建成后，曾一度出现过严重的铺张浪费现象，各社非生产开支过大，并且过分强调了社员的集体利益而忽视了个人利益等等偏向。
    经过反复讨论后，会议确定将全省原订的今年粮食增产30％的计划指标修订为20％。会议要求采取各种农业上的措施来保证完成这一任务并且保证社员增产增收。
    大会最后选出新的中共广西省委员会的委员、候补委员共四十六人，选出了出席党的第八次全国代表大会代表、候补代表共二十二人。
