    Package Deal Apologies
    Lao Hong
    In several large and small cities, I have discovered a completely new profession that has emerged since liberation. It is indeed difficult to categorize this profession. However, if we trace the roots of those engaged in this profession, they originally belonged to the "astrology and fortune-telling" category, but they have now completely changed their trade to meet the needs of society. Just look at how they have changed the words on their original signs from "predicting fortunes and foretelling good and bad luck" to "ghostwriting autobiographies, package deal apologies," and you will suddenly understand the nature of this profession.

    Look: a young wife walks over and says:
    "Sir, my child is too disobedient. This morning I gently patted him twice, and a comrade from the residents' committee wants me to write a self-criticism. Please write it for me."
    "Okay, okay, this is feudal and autocratic thinking. I'll write it for you."

    Another female worker walks over and says:
    "Sir, because I know a few male comrades, and I haven't done anything wrong, the team leader wants me to write a self-criticism, but I don't know how to write it..."
    "Okay, okay, this should be bourgeois corrupt thinking, would you agree?"
    "Just write it however you want."

    The problem is not that this young wife or female worker is illiterate. The problem is why this kind of "package deal apology writing" can actually become a social profession.

    包写检讨
    劳洪
    我在几个大小城市里，发现有一种在解放后说来是全新的职业。这种职业如果要给它归一下类，的确很难。但倘若要追寻一下操这种职业的人的根柢，他们原是属于“星、相”一流，可是现在已经应社会的需要而完全改业了。这只要看一看他们把原来招牌上写着的“代推流年，预卜吉凶”改为“代作自传，包写检讨”，你就会恍然大悟这种职业的性质。
    请看：一个年轻媳妇走过来了，说：
    “先生，我那孩子太不听话，今天早上轻轻拍了他两下，居民委员会有个同志就要我写检讨，请你代我写写吧。”
    “好的好的，你这是封建专制思想嘛，我替你写。”
    又一个女工走过来了，说：
    “先生，我因为认识几个男同志，又没做甚么坏事，组长就要我写检讨，我又不会写，……”
    “好的好的，这应当是资产阶级的腐化思想，你说对吗？”
    “随你怎么写就怎么写吧。”
    问题不在于这个年轻媳妇或女工不认识字。问题在于为什么这种“包写检讨”也居然能成为一种社会职业。
