Shenyang Paint Factory Produces 98 New Types of Paint

(Our Shenyang Dispatch) After winning first place in the inter-factory competition among the heavy industry system's eight factories in the Shenyang area in the first quarter of this year, the Shenyang Paint Factory completed its semi-annual plans for total product value, major product varieties, profits, and costs eight days ahead of schedule on June 22nd. In the first half of this year, the factory successfully trial-produced a total of ninety-eight new types of heat-resistant, climate-resistant, and moisture-resistant paints, exceeding the new product trial production plan by 48%, averaging one new product successfully trial-produced every two days. After technical inspection, the quality of these new products fully meets Soviet standards. These ninety-eight new paints, which are bright in color and excellent in quality, are mainly used for agricultural machinery, precision instruments, heavy machinery, and transportation vehicles, and most of them could not be produced in our country in the past. For example, the newly trial-produced alkyd paint can withstand the erosion of different climates when brushed on train carriages. There is a 65-degree reversible discoloration paint that changes color when heated to 65 degrees Celsius and returns to its original color when the temperature decreases. Various electrical equipment coated with this paint can promptly reflect the temperature of the electrical equipment and prevent malfunctions.

    沈阳油漆厂制成98种新油漆
    本报沈阳电　沈阳油漆厂在今年第一季度取得沈阳地区重工业系统八个工厂厂际竞赛第一名后，又在六月二十二日提前八天完成了上半年的产品总值、主要产品品种、利润、成本计划。这个厂在今年上半年总共试制成功九十八种耐热、耐气候侵蚀、抗潮的新油漆，超过新产品试制计划的48％，平均每两天就试制成功一种新产品。这些新产品经过技术检查，质量完全合乎苏联标准。这九十八种色泽鲜明、质量优良的新油漆中，主要是供应农业机器、精密仪器、重型机器和交通工具使用的，绝大部分也是我国过去不能生产的。例如新试制的醇酸漆，刷在火车车厢上能耐不同气候的侵蚀。有一种六十五度可逆变色漆，加热到六十五度时，就能变色，温度减低时，又能恢复原色，各种电器设备涂上这种油漆，可以及时反映电器设备的温度防止故障。
