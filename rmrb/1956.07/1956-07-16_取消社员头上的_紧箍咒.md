Removing the "Tightening Spell" on Cooperative Members
Lu Qing

Some cadres of agricultural production cooperatives mistakenly use punishment and coercion as means to advance their work. They use many methods to restrict cooperative members as if they were wearing a "tightening spell."

The agricultural production cooperative in Lianhe Township, Dalai County, Jilin Province, stipulates: If a member misses work without reporting it and it affects others' production, the member who missed work must compensate for the full cost of labor and animal power; if the member only misses his own work, three work points will be deducted; being late or leaving early for work will result in no work points being calculated for the day. Cooperative members will have work points deducted for arguing during work; work points will be deducted for not attending meetings; work points will be deducted for being absent from study sessions; work points will be deducted for not offering opinions or speaking ill behind others' backs. Party members, Youth League members, team leaders, and group leaders who violate the rules will be fined double.

In some places in Hebei Province, cooperative cadres casually label cooperative members with big hats. When dealing with issues related to the individual interests of cooperative members and the collective interests of the cooperative, they often favor the interests of the cooperative while neglecting the individual interests of cooperative members. If a cooperative member raises a different opinion, the cooperative cadre will label them as "sabotaging production" or "opposing socialism." Some cooperatives even hang "lazybones" signs on the doors of cooperative members who are not actively working and insert "lazybones" flags.

Some cooperatives refuse to adjourn meetings until members agree to invest when mobilizing members to invest; or freeze members' deposits in credit cooperatives as investments in the cooperative; or even search members' homes at will.

The result of using these methods of punishment and coercion is that the production enthusiasm of cooperative members is greatly frustrated. Wasted work, absenteeism, and missed work are becoming more and more common in the cooperative. After the Lianhe Cooperative in Dalai County stipulated so many "deduction of points" methods, a production team often had five or six people missing work. Some cooperative members dawdle during production, taking breaks while working, and some feign illness to avoid work. Wealthy cooperative members are afraid of revealing their wealth and deliberately pretend to be poor in order to get relief; some withdraw their savings and spend them lavishly.

Obviously, using this simple and crude method of punishment and coercion can only ruin the cooperative, not make it better. It shackles the enthusiasm and creativity of cooperative members. How can we bring out the enthusiasm and creativity of cooperative members? On the one hand, we must strengthen political and ideological work for cooperative members to raise their socialist consciousness; on the other hand, we must make cooperative members care about the interests of the cooperative, correctly handle the relationship between the individual interests of cooperative members and the collective interests, and make cooperative members care about the fruits of their labor from a material point of view. This labor achievement must be protected by the cooperative and must not be deducted or fined at will. Only through these two aspects of work can cooperative members truly feel that they are the masters of the cooperative and consciously and willingly use their strength in the collective cause.

    取消社员头上的“紧箍咒”
    鲁青
    有些农业生产合作社的干部，错误地把惩罚和强制作为推进工作的手段。他们用许多办法把社员限制得像戴上了“紧箍咒”一样。
    吉林省大来县联合乡农业生产合作社规定：误工不报告，影响别人生产，误工人要包赔全部人、畜用工的代价；光自己误工的扣工三分；劳动中迟到早退，一天不计工分。社员在劳动中发生争吵要扣工分；开会不到要扣工分；学习缺席要扣工分；有意见不提、背后乱说也要扣工分。党员、团员、队长、组长违反制度者加罚一倍。
    河北省有些地方的社干部动不动就给社员乱扣大帽子。在处理有关社员个人利益和社的集体利益的问题的时候，往往偏于照顾社的利益而忽视社员个人的利益。社员提出不同的意见，社干部就给扣一个“破坏生产”或“反对社会主义”的帽子。有的社甚至给不积极劳动的社员门上挂“懒汉牌”，插“懒汉旗”。
    有些合作社，在动员社员投资的时候，不认数不散会；或者冻结社员在信用社里的存款，作为对合作社的投资；甚至随便到社员家里去搜查。
    采用这些惩罚和强制的办法，结果是使社员的生产积极性大受挫折。社里的窝工、旷工、误工现象越来越多。大来县联合社规定了那么多“扣分”的办法以后，一个生产队经常都有五、六个人误工。有些社员在生产中磨磨蹭蹭，一边干活一边歇，有的装病不出工。有钱的社员怕露富，故意装穷要救济；有的取出存款大吃大喝。
    显然，用这种简单粗暴的惩罚和强制的办法是只能把社办坏，不能把社办好的。它束缚了社员的积极性和创造性。怎样才能使社员的积极性和创造性发挥出来呢？一方面要加强对社员的政治思想工作，提高社员的社会主义觉悟；另一方面要使社员关心社的利益，正确的处理社员个人利益和集体利益的关系，使社员从物质利益上去关心自己的劳动成果。这种劳动成果一定要受到合作社的保护，决不能随便乱扣乱罚。只有通过这两方面的工作，才能使社员真正感觉到自己是合作社的主人，自觉自愿地把自己的力量用在集体的事业上。
