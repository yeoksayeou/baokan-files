Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, 20th -- After more than three months of teaching practice, the Yunnan Nationalities Institute has proven that the improved New Dai script can be learned by adult Dai people in two months.

Fifty Dai youths studying the New Dai script at the Yunnan Nationalities Institute have been studying for three and a half months. Thirty of them have learned the New Dai script of the Dehong Dai Autonomous Region, and twenty have learned the New Dai script of the Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Region. Now, they can not only skillfully write letters and take notes in the New Dai script, but also jointly undertake the translation of all Dai language broadcast scripts for the Yunnan People's Broadcasting Station to the Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture. These fifty Dai youths all have a Chinese proficiency of at least junior primary school level and are the first batch of Dai translation talents cultivated by the Yunnan Nationalities Institute in a planned way.

According to Dao Zhongqiang, a teacher of the New Dai script, teaching practice has proved that the New Dai script is easy for adult Dai people to learn. Generally, Dai cadres without a basis in the old Dai script and who do not understand Chinese can learn to read and write in just one month, and can use it proficiently after two months.

    两个月可以学会新傣文
    新华社昆明20日电　云南民族学院经过三个多月的教学实践，证明改进后的新傣文，成年的傣族人在两个月内就可以学会。
    在云南民族学院学习新傣文的五十名傣族青年，经过了三个半月的学习，其中三十个人学会了德宏傣族地区的新傣文，二十个人学会了西双版纳傣族地区的新傣文。现在，他们不仅能用新傣文熟练地写信和记笔记，而且共同担负起云南人民广播电台对西双版纳傣族自治州全部傣语广播稿的翻译工作。这五十名傣族青年都具有初小以上的汉文水平，是云南民族学院有计划地培养的第一批傣族翻译人材。
    据新傣文教员刀忠强说，教学的实践证明，新傣文很容易为傣族成年人学会，一般没有旧傣文基础和不懂汉语的傣族干部，只要一个月就可以学会读和写，两个月以后能熟练的运用了。
