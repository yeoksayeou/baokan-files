Letter to Danny

(Discussing the performance of Act II Scene II of "Romeo and Juliet")

Danny:

The performance of "Romeo and Juliet" was very successful. I had a very enjoyable evening. On the long walk home late at night, I savored your directorial successes scene by scene. The night didn't feel cold, and the road didn't seem long. The starlight after the long rain was especially lovely. And the charm of art was even more intoxicating.

But when I thought of Act II Scene II, I felt uneasy. This is Shakespeare's ode to eternal love and youth. Its beauty will live on with humanity forever. The garden wall suddenly retreated to the side of the stage automatically – forgive me for saying so, but this was too much like a magic trick. It surprised the audience. The scenery could also walk. One of the most important lyrical scenes was damaged by the applause for the scene-changing technique.

And what kind of garden did it reveal! Please don't be offended by my analogy. It was too much like a corner of a Shanghai alley house. So narrow, the balcony almost touched the wall that Romeo jumped into the garden from. The word "almost" might be an exaggeration, because there were stone seats in between. But it was indeed too close. I couldn't imagine this little corner being the place where this immortal love poem took place. The feeling of a "garden" was gone; the feeling of a warm night and the twinkling stars was also gone. I know the stage itself is too small (why should an "experimental" theater be small? Why does it have to be like a "model"? How can you experiment? Shouldn't experiments be particularly large? Particularly scientifically investigated? I read Comrade Li Bozhao's speech at the Third Session of the National People's Congress, and I sympathize with her one hundred and twenty percent), scene changes must be quick and simple, and you have racked your brains, but I would rather sacrifice everything and hope that Shakespeare's poetry lives more vividly in front of the audience.

The actors were naturally inevitably affected in this scene as well. Romeo and Juliet's soliloquies were like dialogues. The cramped space limited the movements and ruined the mood. Speaking of soliloquies, forgive me for being frank again: the actors were too focused on making sure the audience could hear them (the audience will hear them, as long as they speak appropriately). Maybe they didn't have this idea at all, but they didn't create a more beautiful lyrical realm for the audience, especially since the environment was already unsuitable, they had to rely more on the power of the words!

I think you should put special effort into this scene, because almost every educated audience member has imagined themselves as Romeo and Juliet in their imagination and emotions when they read this scene before.

I don't know if my regret is correct. Because I was in a hurry to leave after the show, I didn't have the opportunity to talk to you in detail, so I had to leave it here as a criticism. But I am extremely satisfied with the entire performance. As an audience member, I express my twelve points of respect for the performance of the training class.

    （谈“柔密欧与幽丽叶”第二幕第二场的演出）丹尼：
    “柔密欧与幽丽叶”的演出很成功。我过了一个非常愉快的夜晚。我在深夜的悠长的归路上，一场一场回味你在导演上的成功。夜不觉凉了，路不嫌长了。久雨之后的星光分外可爱。艺术的魅力也更醉人。
    但是我一想到第二幕第二场，却就心绪不宁了。这是一首莎士比亚对永生的爱情和青春的赞歌。它的隽美将永远和人类一道活了下去。花园墙忽然自动退到舞台一旁去了，——恕我直说，这太像戏法儿。它使观众惊奇。布景也会走路。一场最重要的抒情好戏，就在称赞换景技巧的心情之下受了损伤。
    而它露出了一个什么样的花园！请你不要见怪我的比喻。这太像上海阔弄堂房子的一个角落。那样狭小，阳台几乎贴住柔密欧跳进花园的那堵墙了。几乎两个字也许过分，因为中间还有石头座位。但是确实是太近了些。我想像不出这小角落会是这首不朽情诗的发生所在。“花园”的感觉没有了；夜晚的温馨和星空的晶莹的感觉也没有了。我知道舞台本身太小（为什么“实验”剧场，就应该小？就非像“模型”不可？怎么做实验啊？做实验，不正该特别大吗？特别科学地考究吗？我读李伯钊同志在全国人民代表大会第三次会议上的发言，一百二十分同情），换景必须简快，你们已经绞尽了脑汁，但是我宁可牺牲一切，也希望莎士比亚的诗更多地活在观众面前。
    演员自然而然在这一场也不免受到了牵连。柔密欧和幽丽叶的独白就像在对话一样。空间的局促限制了动作，也毁坏了境界。说到独白，恕我再直说一句：演员太想着要观众听见了（观众会听见的，只要说的恰到好处）。也许他们根本没有这种想法，不过他们没有把更美的抒情境界给观众创造出来，尤其是环境已经不衬了，就非多靠读词的力量不可！
    我觉得你们应该特别在这一场下工夫，因为几乎每一个有修养的观众，从前念这一场戏的时候，都在想像上、感情上做过柔密欧、幽丽叶。
    我这一点遗憾，不知道是否正确。因为散戏的时候，我急着要走，没有机会和你细谈，只好作为指摘，留在这里提出。但是我对整个演出是极其满意的。作为一个观众，我对训练班的演出表示十二分敬意。
