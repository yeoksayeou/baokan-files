Xinhua News Agency, Qiqihar, July 2nd: The question of how rural party branches should lead advanced agricultural production cooperatives has been on the minds of many rural party members and grassroots organizations in Keshan County, Heilongjiang Province for more than three months. In mid-June, the CPC Keshan County Committee convened a rural political work conference, providing a clear answer to this question.

Before the spring plowing this year, 98% of farmers in Keshan County, Heilongjiang Province, joined advanced cooperatives. Afterwards, many rural party branches and members became vague about the Party's tasks in rural areas. Who should lead the advanced cooperatives? Many rural branch cadres said that "it should be led by the cooperative's management committee," believing that "the party branch committee members are all members of the cooperative's management committee, and everyone is singing from the same hymn sheet, so there is no need to hold separate party meetings." Some grassroots party cadres also believed that "advanced cooperatives have the superior system of 'distribution according to work', and without ideological education, members can still work actively." Many party members said: "In the past, we took the lead in following the cooperative path, and now that the masses have joined the cooperatives, in the future, we will just take the lead in working hard and earning more workdays!" As a result, the organizational life of many rural branches became lax. In some districts, 80% of the rural branches had not held a single meeting in the three months after the realization of advanced cooperation, abandoning their leadership over the cooperatives. A serious tendency of blurring the lines between the Party and the cooperative, and the cooperative management committee taking over everything, appeared in rural work.

More than three hundred grassroots party cadres from the county reflected the above situation at the rural political work conference convened by the CPC Keshan County Committee, and then examined its consequences: Due to the weakening of the Party's political and ideological work in the cooperatives, the bureaucratic and coercive style of work of the cooperative cadres became widespread, and the principle of democratic management of the cooperatives was forgotten by many. Many cooperative cadres were accustomed to issuing orders in the office, rarely going deep into the fields, and replacing persuasion and education with administrative orders in their work. In the county's cooperatives, 30% to 40% of the production team leaders did not regularly participate in field labor. The principle of running cooperatives diligently and thriftily was not well implemented in some cooperatives where the party branch had abandoned leadership. Many cooperatives blindly set up stalls, sought extravagance, and wasted resources. In these cooperatives, phenomena such as members not observing labor discipline, not cherishing public property, not caring about the quality of labor, and a lack of unity among some cooperative cadres also occurred continuously.

The above situation educated the cadres attending the meeting, and they began to realize that the emergence of a complex, collective, large-scale socialist agricultural economy did not lighten the leadership responsibility of rural party branches, but increased it. How should rural party branches lead cooperatives in the future? The CPC Keshan County Committee, in its resolution on strengthening the leadership of rural branches over cooperatives, pointed out that the basic task of the Party in rural areas in the future is to lead farmers to learn how to manage cooperatives, gradually realize the forty demands put forward in the National Agricultural Development Program (Draft), thoroughly change the economic and cultural outlook of the countryside, and consolidate the socialist economic system. The resolution put forward five specific tasks for rural party branches, including discussing and deciding on major issues in the cooperatives based on the Party's policies, educating members to raise their socialist consciousness, actively learning culture and science and technology, overcoming selfishness and conservatism, correctly resolving the contradictions between individual members and the collective of the cooperative, and running the cooperative well. The resolution also put forward five specific requirements for every rural party member, including conscientiously implementing the Party's policies, having a high degree of responsibility for the collective cause of the cooperative, and becoming a model for uniting members to complete various tasks. The resolution also made specific provisions on strengthening the collective leadership and division of labor and responsibility of party branches, holding party member meetings in a timely manner, and promoting inner-party democracy.

At present, rural party organizations at all levels in the county's districts, townships, and cooperatives are holding committee meetings and grassroots party member meetings to conscientiously convey and implement this resolution, and are actively correcting the tendency of neglecting and abandoning the leadership of grassroots party organizations over cooperatives.

    中共克山县委召开农村政治工作会议
    讨论支部怎样领导高级社
    农村的党支部怎样领导高级农业生产合作社的问题，已经在黑龙江省克山县的不少农村党员和基层组织中存在三个多月了。六月中旬，中共克山县委员会召开了农村政治工作会议，对这个问题作了明确的回答。
    据新华社齐齐哈尔2日电　今年春耕前，黑龙江省克山县98％的农户加入了高级社。以后，许多农村支部和党员对党在农村的任务模糊起来。高级社应该由谁来领导？不少农村支部的干部都说“应该由合作社管理委员会领导”，他们认为“党的支部委员都是社的管理委员，一百个和尚都念一本经，没有单独召开党的会议的必要了”，一些党的基层干部还认为：“高级社有‘按劳取酬’的优越制度，不进行思想教育，社员也能积极劳动”；许多党员这样说：“过去咱带头走合作化道路，现在群众都入社了，今后咱光带头干活，多挣劳动日就够了！因此，许多农村支部的组织生活涣散起来，有的区80％的农村支部在实现高级合作化以后的三个多月中没有开过一次会，放弃了对合作社的领导。农村工作中出现了党、社不分，以及合作社管理委员会包揽一切的严重倾向。
    来自全县的三百多名党的基层干部，在中共克山县委员会召开的农村政治工作会议上反映了上述情况以后，又检查了它的后果：由于合作社中党的政治思想工作的削弱，合作社干部的官僚主义和强迫命令作风普遍滋长起来了，合作社民主管理的方针被许多人忘在脑后。许多社干部习惯在办公室里发号施令，很少深入田间，在工作中用行政命令代替了说服教育。全县合作社中还有百分之三、四十的生产队长不经常参加田间劳动。勤俭办社的方针在党支部放弃领导的一些合作社里普遍贯彻执行得不好，不少合作社盲目摆摊子，图阔气，浪费现象严重。在这些合作社里，社员不遵守劳动纪律、不爱护公共财产、不关心劳动质量以及一些社干部之间不团结的现象也不断发生。
    上述情况，教育了参加会议的干部们，他们开始认识到复杂的集体的大规模的社会主义农业经济的出现，不是减轻了农村党支部的领导责任，而是加重了。今后农村支部怎样领导合作社呢？召开这个会议的中共克山县委在加强农村支部对合作社领导的决议中指出：今后党在农村的基本任务是领导农民学会管理合作社，逐步实现全国农业发展纲要（草案）中提出的四十条要求，彻底改变农村的经济、文化面貌，巩固社会主义的经济制度。决议中向农村党支部提出了根据党的方针政策讨论决定合作社中的重大问题，以及教育社员提高社会主义觉悟，积极学习文化和科学技术，克服自私心理、保守思想、正确解决社员个人和合作社集体之间的矛盾，办好合作社等五项具体任务。决议中对每一个农村党员也提出了认真执行党的政策，对合作社集体事业有高度的责任心，成为团结社员完成各项任务的模范等五项具体要求。决议还对加强党支部的集体领导和分工负责制、及时召开党员大会，发扬党内民主等问题做了具体的规定。
    目前，全县的区、乡、合作社的各级农村党组织都在召开委员会议和基层党员大会认真地传达、贯彻执行这个决议，积极纠正忽视和放弃基层党组织对合作社领导的偏向。
