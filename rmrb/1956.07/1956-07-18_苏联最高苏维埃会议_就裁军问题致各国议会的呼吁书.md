Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, July 17th, TASS dispatch: The appeal to the parliaments of all countries on the issue of disarmament, passed by the Supreme Soviet of the USSR on the 16th, states that, guided by the lofty goal of consolidating international peace, the Supreme Soviet of the USSR considers it its duty to bring to the attention of the peoples, governments, and parliaments of all countries the urgent and extremely important issue of stopping the arms race, reducing armaments, and banning atomic and hydrogen weapons—an issue of deep concern to the people of all countries.

Unfortunately, the efforts made in the United Nations over the past decade to reach an agreement on disarmament have not yet achieved success.

The world continues to expand its armaments and further stockpile weapons of mass destruction—atomic and hydrogen bombs. Millions of people remain separated from their homes, serving in the military. All of this places a heavy burden on the people of all countries, making them more insecure about their future and increasing their fear of a new war threat.

In this situation, it is the sacred duty of the parliaments and governments of all countries to take effective measures to stop the arms race, without waiting for the United Nations to find a solution acceptable to all relevant countries. The recent relaxation of international tensions, the further development of friendly contacts and good relations between countries based on the principles of peaceful coexistence, all contribute to this.

Unilateral disarmament by individual countries is an extremely important measure to create conditions for the implementation of a general disarmament plan. The major powers, which bear the primary responsibility for maintaining and safeguarding world peace, should play a special role in this regard. It is the major powers with large armed forces that should set an example in reducing their armed forces and armaments.

The Soviet Union has already reduced its armed forces and armaments and cut military spending. Without waiting for the conclusion of a general disarmament agreement, the Soviet Union reduced its armed forces by 640,000 men in 1955 and decided to further reduce its armed forces by 1.2 million men before May 1, 1957. The Soviet Union's armaments, combat equipment, and defense expenditures would also be reduced accordingly.

The Supreme Soviet approves the Soviet government's decision to reduce armed forces and armaments, considering it a measure of goodwill and a very important beginning that can promote a practical solution to the disarmament issue.

The Supreme Soviet of the USSR calls on the parliaments of all countries to study and support this action taken by the Soviet Union as a pioneering effort, to also take effective measures aimed at stopping the arms race, and to make due contributions to the cause of strengthening international peace.

### 苏联最高苏维埃会议  就裁军问题致各国议会的呼吁书

    苏联最高苏维埃会议
    就裁军问题致各国议会的呼吁书
    新华社17日讯　塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联最高苏维埃会议十六日通过的就裁军问题致各国议会的呼吁书说，苏联最高苏维埃本着巩固国际和平的崇高宗旨，认为有责任提请各国人民、政府和议会注意急迫的、现代极其重要的、为世界各国人民所深切关心的问题——停止扩充军备、裁减军备和禁止原子武器和氢武器的问题。
    最近十年来在联合国中为了达成裁军协议所作的努力，可惜至今还没有取得成就。
    世界继续扩充军备、进一步贮藏大规模毁灭性的武器——原子弹和氢弹。数以百万计的人仍旧离别家园，在服兵役。这一切都使各国人民肩负重担，使他们对自己前途更加没有信心和增加对新战争威胁的恐惧。
    在这种情况下，不等联合国求得为一切有关国家所能接受的解决办法就采取停止扩充军备的有效措施，是各国议会和政府的神圣责任。最近国际紧张局势的缓和、各国以和平共处的原则为基础的友好接触和良好关系的进一步发展，都有助于这一点。
    各国单独裁军是为实现普遍裁军计划创造条件的极为重要的措施。对维护和保卫世界和平负有主要责任的大国应该在这方面起特别的作用。正是拥有大量武装力量的大国应当在裁减武装部队和军备方面树立榜样。
    苏联已经裁减了自己的武装部队和军备，削减了军费。苏联不等总的裁军协定的达成，就在1955年裁减了自己的武装部队六十四万人，还决定在1957年5月1日以前再把武装部队裁减一百二十万人。苏联的军备、战斗装备以及国防费用也将作相应的缩减。
    最高苏维埃批准苏联政府关于裁减武装部队和军备的决定，认为这是一个善意的措施，是一个能促使裁军问题得到实际解决的非常重要的开端。
    苏联最高苏维埃呼吁各国议会研究和支持苏联率先采取的这个行动，也采取旨在停止扩充军备的有效措施，为加强国际和平的事业作出应有的贡献。
