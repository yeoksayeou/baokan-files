We Are Still Waiting for a Reply

　　In April, this newspaper forwarded a letter from reader Wang Hongwen accusing Zhai Yutian, the secretary of the general branch of Xinyuanzhuang Township in Ninghe County, Hebei Province, of retaliating against him, to the CCP Ninghe County Committee, hoping they would investigate the truth and reply to this newspaper. At the end of June, the reply letter from the CCP Ninghe County Committee arrived. Upon opening it, it felt somewhat strange. The person writing the reply was none other than Zhai Yutian, the very general branch secretary being accused. In addition, there were a few sentences from the Junliangcheng District Committee agreeing with Zhai Yutian's reply. As for the Ninghe County Committee, apart from adding an envelope, there was nothing else. Apparently, in the eyes of the County Committee, since the accused had written a reply, and since the District Committee agreed with this reply, that was the most authoritative conclusion. What else was there to say besides forwarding it? What's strange is not that the accused is only blaming the accuser for how egregious he is, which is very easy to understand; what is strange is the attitude of the Ninghe County Committee in handling this accusation letter, which is a bit difficult to understand.

　　As a County Committee, why, upon receiving this accusation letter, did it actually forward it to the accused? Why did it adopt such an irresponsible and unserious attitude of "forwarding the letter as is" toward the issue that the Party newspaper requested be investigated and handled? For the sake of being responsible to the accuser, we are still looking forward to a reply that is not strange but normal.

    我们还等着答复
    四月间，本报曾经把读者王鸿文控告河北省宁河县新元庄乡总支书记翟玉田对他实行打击报复的信，转给中共宁河县委会，希望他们调查真相并且答复本报。六月底，中共宁河县委会的答复信寄来了，打开一看，使人觉得有些古怪，写答复信的不是别人，正是被控告的总支书记翟玉田自己，另外还有军粮城区委会同意翟玉田答复信的几句话，至于宁河县委会，除过加了一个信封，什么都没有。大概在县委会看来，既然被控告的人写了答复，既然区委会同意了这个答复，这就是最权威的定案，除过照转，还有什么可说的呢？古怪的不是被控告人一味指责控告人如何罪大恶极，这是极容易理解的；古怪的是宁河县委会处理这封控告信的态度，这就有点不容易理解了。
    作为一个县委会，为什么在接到这封控告信的时候，竟然把控告信转给被控告者呢？为什么对党报要求调查处理的问题采取了“来函照转”的极不负责极不郑重的态度呢？为了对控告者负责，我们还期待着一个不是古怪的而是正常的答复。
