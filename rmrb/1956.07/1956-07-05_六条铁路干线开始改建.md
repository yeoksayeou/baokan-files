    Reconstruction Begins on Six Major Railway Lines
    (Our dispatch) Reconstruction work is underway on six major railway lines. These routes are: Bin (Harbin) Bei (An) Line, Sui (Hua) Jia (Musi) Line, Shen (Yang) Ji (Lin) Line, Bao (Ji) Lan (Zhou) Line, South Tongpu Line (Taiyuan to Fenglingdu), and Ning (Nanjing) Hu (Shanghai) Line.

    These trunk lines mostly connect other major trunk lines and large industrial areas. Most of them were built before liberation, and many places were not designed reasonably. Either the station lines are short, the slopes are steep, or the tracks are narrow, so the locomotive traction tonnage is very low, and it cannot meet the needs of the increasing transportation. After reconstruction, the transportation capacity of these lines will be greatly improved, and the safety of train operation can be further guaranteed. The completed part of the Bubei Line and Suijia Line has increased the transport capacity by 4.45%; the Suijia Line has rebuilt a large slope, which has increased the locomotive traction tonnage from more than 1,000 tons to 2,600 tons, and the locomotive traction tonnage of the three branch lines of Tanglin Line, Hegang Line and Jiafu Line connected to the Suijia Line can also be increased accordingly. After the reconstruction of the South Tongpu and Baolan lines, large locomotives will be running.

    六条铁路干线开始改建
    本报讯　六条铁路干线的改建工程正在进行。这些路线是：滨（哈尔滨）北（安）线、绥（化）佳（木斯）线、沈（阳）吉（林）线、宝（鸡）兰（州）线、南同蒲线（太原至风陵渡）和宁（南京）沪（上海）线。
    这些干线大都连接着其他主要干线和大工业区。多数是解放前建成的，许多地方设计得不够合理。不是站线短、坡度大，就是道轨窄，因而机车牵引定数很低，不能满足日益增加的运输的需要。经过改建后，这些线路的运输能力将大大提高，并可更进一步保障行车安全。滨北线和绥佳线现在已经完工的一部分工程就使运输能力提高了4.45％；绥佳线改建了一处大坡度，使机车牵引定数由一千多吨提高到二千六百吨，和绥佳线相连的汤林线、鹤岗线、佳富线等三条支线的机车牵引定数也可相应提高。南同蒲和宝兰线改建后将行驶大型机车。
