    Xinhua News Agency, 12th: The whole country will mobilize the masses to collect tree seeds on a large scale to meet the needs of afforestation tasks stipulated in the national greening plan.
    The National Forest Seed Work Conference convened by the Ministry of Forestry in Beijing on July 2nd concluded today. The conference believes that to green the country within twelve years, the annual afforestation task is huge, and a large number of tree seeds are needed. Next year, the country plans to afforest with 140 million kilograms of forest seeds. However, as long as the masses are mobilized to strive for local seed collection and local afforestation, self-use and self-collection, planting what trees and collecting what seeds, with surplus areas supporting seed-deficient areas, and vigorously improving the quality of collected tree seeds, China has enough tree seeds to meet the needs of large-scale afforestation.
    The conference believes that the poor quality of tree seeds currently collected in various places is a serious problem. A large number of seeds are collected from poorly developed mother trees or from disparate alien lands, resulting in poor heredity; low germination rates; and many seeds are impure and infected with diseases and insect pests. It is urgent to improve seed collection work and improve seed quality. This requires strengthening technical guidance on seed collection for the broad masses, especially for agricultural producers' cooperatives and Communist Youth League members. All localities must first train forestry grassroots cadres to guide the masses.
    The conference also decided to strengthen the survey of forest tree seed sources to ascertain the source conditions, delineate seed collection areas, tap the potential of tree species and protect mother trees, improve seed collection, inspection, storage, allocation, and other work, and improve seed collection tools and promote existing excellent tools.

    领导群众做好采集树种工作
    新华社12日讯　全国将发动群众大规模地采集树种，来满足绿化全国规划所规定的造林任务的需要。
    七月二日林业部在北京召开的全国林木种子工作会议今天已经结束。会议认为，要在十二年内绿化全国，每年造林的任务很大，所需树种极多。明年全国计划造林就需林木种子达一亿四千万公斤。但是，只要发动群众争取就地采种就地造林，自用自采，造什么林采什么种，自给有余地区支援缺种区，并大力提高所采树种的质量，中国有足够的树种，可以满足大规模造林的需要。
    会议认为，当前各地采集的树种质量很差是一个严重的问题。大量种子采自发育不良的母树或条件悬殊的异地，遗传性不好；发芽率低；种子不纯和感染有病虫害的很多，亟须改进采种工作，提高种子的质量。这就须要加强对广大群众，特别是对农业生产合作社、对青年团员的采种技术指导。各地须首先训练指导群众的林业基层干部。
    会议还决定了加强林木的种源调查来摸清种源情况，并划分采种区，挖掘树种潜力和保护母树，改进种子采集、检验、保管、调拨等工作，并改进采种工具和推广现有的优良工具。
