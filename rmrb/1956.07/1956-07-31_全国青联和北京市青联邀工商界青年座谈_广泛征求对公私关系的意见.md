    All-China Youth Federation and Beijing Youth Federation Invite Industrial and Commercial Youth to Symposium
    Widely Soliciting Opinions on Public-Private Relations

    (Our newspaper reports) The All-China Democratic Youth Federation and the Beijing Democratic Youth Federation invited young people from industrial and commercial circles in Beijing to a symposium on the 28th, focusing on exchanging views on public-private relations.

    At the meeting, everyone believed that there had been great improvements in public-private relations compared to the past, but some problems still existed. Many people frankly criticized some of the shortcomings of the public representatives. They generally felt that the biggest distress of private personnel in cooperative work at present is that they feel unsure and restrained, and dare not take bold responsibility when working. Therefore, they requested clear division of labor and responsibilities, and the correction of certain phenomena that do not sufficiently respect their authority. Guo Zengyao, the factory director of the joint public-private Zhenhua Oil Factory, said: The Zhenhua Oil Factory implemented joint public-private ownership in February this year, but the resident factory representative system is still maintained. Due to unclear responsibilities, it has already caused losses in production. Many people also reflected that after joint ownership, private personnel lack methods for socialist management and operation, and hope that public representatives will support and help them.

    Everyone believed that many problems in public-private relations are caused by small things such as a rigid working attitude and simple working methods. If these misunderstandings are not resolved in a timely manner, they will accumulate more and more, resulting in losses to the work. Therefore, as long as both the public and private sectors frequently exchange opinions frankly and carry out criticism and self-criticism, public-private relations will be easier to manage well.

    At the meeting, everyone requested that public representatives be able to find private personnel more often to exchange opinions, and it would be best to affirm the work achievements of private personnel and point out problems in work and thought at any time. Private personnel must also seriously do their work. Attendees also hoped that the All-China Youth Federation and the Beijing Youth Federation would cooperate with relevant parties to summarize the experiences of one or two factories and stores in managing public-private relations well and promote them.

    全国青联和北京市青联邀工商界青年座谈
    广泛征求对公私关系的意见
    本报讯中　华全国民主青年联合会和北京市民主青年联合会在二十八日邀请北京市工商界青年举行座谈会，着重交换了对公私关系问题的意见。
    会上，大家认为在公私关系方面，比过去已有了很大改进，但还存在一些问题。对某些公方人员的缺点，许多人也坦率地提出了批评。他们普遍感到在合作共事方面，当前私方人员最大的苦闷是工作时心中无底，束手束脚，不敢大胆负责。因此，要求明确分工和职责分明，纠正某些不够尊重他们的职权的现象。公私合营振华制油厂厂长郭增尧说：振华制油厂今年二月份已实行公私合营，但至今还保存驻厂员制度，由于职责不明，已造成生产上的损失。许多人还反映，合营后私方人员对社会主义经营管理缺少办法，希望公方代表支持和帮助他们。
    大家认为公私关系上的不少问题，都是由于工作态度生硬，工作方法简单等细小的事情所引起的。这种误会没有及时解决，日积月累，越积越多，结果给工作带来了损失。因此，只要公私双方经常坦率地交换意见，开展批评和自我批评，公私关系就比较容易搞好。
    会上，大家要求公方代表能够多找私方人员交换意见，对私方人员的工作成绩最好能够加以肯定，对工作和思想上的问题也要随时指出。私方人员也要认真的做好工作。到会的人还希望全国青联和北京市青联配合有关方面总结一两个厂店搞好公私关系的经验，加以推广。
