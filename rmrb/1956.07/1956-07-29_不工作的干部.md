    Non-Working Cadre
    In the Yangzhou Coal Construction Company, there is a clerk named Meng Zaiguang. Since she took office in February of last year, she has been using the excuse of not being able to find a nanny to hold her child all day and refuses to work. In August of last year, she took leave to visit her sick child in Nanjing and has been gone for eleven months. It is said that this long leave of absence was approved by the Yangzhou Municipal People's Committee. When the employees questioned this matter, the personnel section said, "The department is responsible for this cadre's long absence." We want to ask the Municipal Personnel Section what exactly its responsibility is? Why do you take "special" care of this kind of "special" cadre? Does the system not apply to her?

    不工作的干部
    扬州市煤建公司有一位文书名叫孟再光，自从她去年二月到职以后，一直借口找不到保姆，整天抱孩子，不肯工作。去年八月她请假到南京去看望生病的孩子，一去就是十一个月。据说，这样长的事假是经过扬州市人民委员会批准了的，当职工们对这件事提出质问时，人事科说：“这个干部长期不归，本科是有责任的”。我们要问市人事科究竟有什么责任呢？你们为什么要对这种“特殊”干部采取“特殊”照顾呢？难道制度对她不适用吗？
