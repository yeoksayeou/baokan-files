    The Wonderful Use of "Transitional Period"
    Some people use the four words "transitional period" as a shield. When male workers request improved working conditions, they use "transitional period" to resist; when female workers suggest establishing childcare organizations, they also use "transitional period" to parry. In their view, the transitional period seems to be a period of not solving problems.
    How can it be considered a "transition" if it transitions but doesn't move? May the thinking of these people also "transition" forward a bit!　Long Zuhhao

    “过渡时期”的妙用
    有的人把“过渡时期”这四个字作为挡箭牌。男工要求改善劳动条件，用“过渡时期”抵挡，女工建议成立托儿组织，也用“过渡时期”招架。在他们看来，过渡时期好像就是不解决问题的时期。
    过渡而又不动，怎么能算“过渡”呢？愿这些人的思想也向前“过渡”一番吧！　龙祖浩
