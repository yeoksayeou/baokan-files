    The Friendship Between the Chinese and Japanese People
    I. Letter from Yasuko Hayase
    In this sultry rainy season, we wholeheartedly welcome the visit of the Chinese Peking Opera Delegation to Tokyo. The Peking Opera Delegation performed many plays in Tokyo, each of which reached the highest artistic level and movingly touched every audience member. Although I have not been able to personally see the Peking Opera at the theater, I have been enjoying the televised broadcasts from the Kabuki-za every night with a feeling of emotion. I am ceaselessly marveling at the amazing and beautiful scenes of the Peking Opera. When the Peking Opera Delegation comes to Tokyo again for performances in July, I plan to see it once no matter what. It would be a great honor if I could see it.
    In these times, we are still constantly receiving letters from our Chinese friends, and we have become good friends with them. Now, it has come to the point where both my daughter and I are corresponding with Chinese friends.
    My daughter has already entered her second year of high school and is studying very diligently. We hope that one day my daughter and I can go together to your picturesque and beautiful country. We pray that this wish of ours is not just a dream but can become a reality.
    Please convey to our deeply affectionate Chinese friends that we have not yet replied to all of their letters one by one. Please ask them to forgive us.

    II. Letter from Nobuyuki Kato
    Please forgive me for impolitely asking you for pigeon whistles in the past without any reason!
    I have been anxiously waiting for them, and now I have received them. In order to make the packaging sturdy, you even specially made a small wooden box, so they arrived without any damage.
    I immediately tied this whistle, which can resolve my homesickness, to the body of a pigeon, so the whistle rang out over the skies of Tokyo and amazed the people of Tokyo.
    Upon receiving the whistles, I can only express my endless gratitude to your company for such kindness.
    The day when diplomatic relations between China and Japan reach a normal state will certainly not be far away. When that time comes, I will definitely repay this kindness.
    Mr. Mei Lanfang is currently performing Peking Opera in Tokyo, which has caused a sensation in the Japanese theater world. However, even if diplomatic relations between the two countries are restored, I will not be able to hear again the performances of Tan Xinpei that I heard in Tianjin when I was sixteen, and later the famous voices of Mr. Bai Wenkui, Mr. Li Jirui (especially in "Dumuguan" and "Beating the Dragon Robe"), Mr. Yang Xiaolou, and others. This is very regrettable. I offer my sincere thanks.
    Nobuyuki Kato

    Editor's Note:
    Nobuyuki Kato
    Mr. Nobuyuki Kato is already over eighty years old and worked as an educator in Henan, Tianjin, Beijing, and other places in our country for about thirty years during the late Qing Dynasty. He believes that Beijing, China, is his second hometown. When he was in Beijing, he raised many pigeons. Later, when he returned to Japan, he often missed China. He often reminisces about his life in Beijing, even in Tokyo. In order to alleviate this "homesickness," he began raising pigeons again. However, there were no pigeon whistles in Japan. This April, he sent a letter to this newspaper describing this situation and asking us to find some pigeon whistles for him. We sent them to him. This is his reply after receiving them.

### 中日两国人民的友谊

专栏：国外来信

    中日两国人民的友谊
    一、早濑安子的信
    在这个闷人的梅雨的季节里，我们衷心地欢迎着中国访日京剧代表团的莅临东京。京剧代表团在东京演出了许多戏，每出戏都达到了最高的艺术水平，动人心弦地感动了每一个观众。我虽然还没有能够亲自在剧院看到京剧，但是我每天晚上都怀着感动的心情欣赏着从歌舞伎座播出来的电视。我为那京剧的惊人美妙的场面，感叹不止。当京剧代表团七月间再度来东京公演的时候，我打算无论如何总得去看一次。如果能够看到，那真是无上光荣。
    这些时候来，我们仍然不断地收到中国朋友们给我们的来信，我们和他们之间已经成了好朋友。现在已经形成我们母女两人都和中国朋友通信的情况了。
    我的女儿已经升入高中二年级了，并且很用功地在学习。我们盼望着有一天我们母女能够一同到你们那景色如画的美好的国家去。我们祈盼我们的这个愿望不是空想，而能成为现实。
    请你们转告隆情厚谊的中国朋友们，他们的来信我们还没有全部一一答复。请他们多多原谅。

    二、加藤信行的信
    过去毫无理由地就向你们要鸽子哨，这是很无礼的事，请你们多多原谅！
    一日千秋地挂念着，可是现在收到了。你们为了使包装坚固，还特为制造了小木箱，结果没有任何损坏地全部收到了。
    我马上就把这个能解乡愁的哨子，绑在鸽子的身上，这样，哨子就在东京的上空响了起来，并且使东京的人们感到惊奇。
    在收到哨子的同时，我只有对贵社这种隆情表示感谢不尽。
    中日两国间的邦交、达到正常状态的日子，一定不会很远了。到那时，我一定要报答这次的厚意。
    梅兰芳先生现在正在东京公演京剧，这使得日本戏剧界为之轰动。然而对我来说，即使两国邦交恢复了，我十六岁时在天津听到的谭鑫培的戏和后来听到的白文奎、李吉瑞（特别是“独木关”、“击鼓骂曹”）、杨少楼等先生的名嗓子也是再听不到了。这是非常令人遗憾的。谨此致以谢意。
    编者按
    加藤信行
    加藤信行先生已经有八十多岁，清朝末期曾经在我国河南、天津、北京等地作过约三十年的教育工作。他认为中国北京就是他的第二故乡。他在北京时，养过许多鸽子。后来他回到日本，经常想念着中国。他在东京也经常回想起北京的生活。为了解他的这种“乡愁”，他就又养起鸽子来。可是在日本没有鸽子哨。今年四月他寄给本报一封信，叙述了这个情况，请我们给他弄些鸽子哨去，我们给他寄去了。这是他收到后的回信。
