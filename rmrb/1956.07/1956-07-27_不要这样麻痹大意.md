    Don't Be So Careless
    In the past six months, our crew members on the Huainan Railway branch line have picked up more than 30 public document bags and briefcases lost by passengers on the train. These bags contained top-secret documents, materials related to counter-revolutionary suppression, bridge design charts, and large sums of Renminbi. Fortunately, these items were all found by our crew members, who then made efforts to return the lost items to their owners. Just imagine, if these important documents, materials, charts, etc., were picked up by saboteurs, what great losses would be caused to the country.
    We hope that the staff members who lost these documents, materials, and charts will seriously examine their own complacency.

    不要这样麻痹大意
    半年来，我们淮南铁路支线的乘务员，在列车上拾到乘客遗失的公文包、皮包达三十多件，这些公文包、皮包内装有绝密文件，肃反材料，还有桥梁设计图表和巨额人民币。幸好，这些东西都是被我们乘务员拾到了，并且设法将失物归还了失主。试想，这些重要文件、材料、图表等要是被破坏分子拾去，将会给国家造成多么大的损失。
    我们希望这些丢失文件、材料、图表的工作人员，要好好检查一下自己的麻痹思想。
