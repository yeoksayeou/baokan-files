    Qin Yi and Ma Lan
    ——Thoughts on the film "Flowers of Ma Lan"
    Sang Fu
    Qin Yi, who plays the female protagonist Ma Lan in the film "Flowers of Ma Lan," is a well-known actress. Before this, she played La Ying in "Happy Family" and Zhui'er in "Two Families."
    "Happy Family" and "Two Families" are Qin Yi's works from the early days after liberation, and also the beginning of her portraying new figures in the new society. At that time, she encountered great difficulties in creating her roles, and she did indeed fail. But failure is often the starting point for success. After more than five years of hard work, today, in "Flowers of Ma Lan," we have seen Qin Yi create a beautiful image of a working woman – the vivid image of Ma Lan!
    Ma Lan is one of the millions of working women in our country. She is gentle yet strong. For the sake of the socialist construction of the motherland, she left her mother and children and resolutely joined the ranks of construction workers, wholeheartedly wanting to become a bulldozer operator, bravely fighting against the feudal remnants of thought that belittled women (including her own husband), and finally succeeded. Qin Yi has very well completed the mission of an actress in shaping this role image. I think this is not only because the actress herself has a beautiful appearance, but more importantly, the actress has endowed the role with a more beautiful inner emotion.
    Here, I don't want to repeat the story of the film. I'll just talk about how the actress created the role based on the prescribed situation in one or two scenes. In the film, there is a scene that shows the situation when Ma Lan leaves home. When the train carrying Ma Lan speeds towards the Northwest Plateau, her mood is very complicated: there is the joy of seeing her husband, whom she has been separated from for a long time, and also the pain of leaving her elderly mother and young children behind. Qin Yi delicately conveyed the complex emotions of the character. Her forced smile, her long lean against the train window, watching the figures of her mother and children gradually recede into the distance, show how much she cherishes these old and young relatives; and the gleam of excitement in her eyes when she gazes at the rotating fields and mountains outside the window also shows how much she hopes to fly to the construction site, to fly to her husband's side as soon as possible. In the monotonous and rhythmic roar of the train, her excited emotions gradually calmed down, and when she got to know the instructor, she seemed even more cheerful. Qin Yi was very natural in expressing the changes in the character's emotions, without giving people a pretentious feeling.
    In another scene – the scene where Ma Lan burned the rice, causing her husband's anger – Qin Yi's performance is also very moving. When Ma Lan's husband disliked the burnt rice and refused to eat it, and even snatched Ma Lan's bowl away, she felt extremely uncomfortable, but she didn't burst into tears, just remained silent and quietly wiped away the tears from the corners of her eyes. This very small action vividly expresses Ma Lan's resolute and unyielding character. Ma Lan loves her husband after all. She feels very sorry for not cooking the rice well, so she hands a steamed bun to her husband and earnestly says to him, "Let me try again! If I still can't learn, I'll give up!" In this scene, Qin Yi did not emphasize any one aspect of the character's personality, but rather blended the character's complex emotions very well, so she made us feel that Ma Lan is a real person, a person with ideals in her career, and a person with deep affection in her marital relationship. Some actors often only express the character's "rationality" when creating roles, and dare not touch the character's inner emotions. Isn't this one of the reasons for the production of formulaic performances, limiting the charm of art to a few correct conclusions?
    Some people think that Qin Yi still has some intellectual flavor in the creation of the image of Ma Lan. I think that since Ma Lan is an urban housewife with some culture, it is acceptable for Qin Yi to express it in this way. However, Qin Yi's design and selection of certain actions are not precise enough. For example, in the first few shots of Ma Lan on the bulldozer, her surprised facial expressions are a bit exaggerated; the emotional transition in the scene where she walks and talks with the instructor after sending her husband away also reveals traces of stiffness.
    Here, we look forward to Qin Yi's new work – the early release of Fang Lin's Wife in the film "Railway Guerrilla," and wish her greater success in the artistic creation of actors.

### 秦怡和马兰——看影片“马兰花开”有感

    秦怡和马兰
    ——看影片“马兰花开”有感   
    桑夫
    在影片“马兰花开”里面扮演女主人公马兰的秦怡，是观众熟知的演员。在这以前，她曾饰演过“农家乐”中的拉英和“两家春”中的坠儿。
    “农家乐”和“两家春”是秦怡解放初期的作品，也是她扮演新社会的新人物的开始。当时，她的角色创造遇到很大的困难，她也确是失败了。但是失败往往是成功的起点。经过五年多的努力，今天，在“马兰花开”中，我们却看到了秦怡创造的一个优美的劳动妇女——马兰的生动的形象！
    马兰，是我国千百万劳动妇女当中的一个。她温柔而又坚强。为着祖国的社会主义建设事业，她离开了母亲和孩子，毅然地走进建设工人的行列里，一心一意要成为一个推土机手，勇敢地和轻视妇女的封建残余思想作斗争（包括她自己的丈夫在内），最后终于获得了成功。秦怡在这个角色形象的塑造上，很好地完成了演员的使命。我想，这不仅是由于演员本身有着一个美丽的外形，更重要的是演员赋予了角色更美丽的内心情感。
    在这里，我不想重复影片的故事。只就一两场戏里面演员如何根据规定情境创造角色来谈谈。在影片里面，有一场戏是表现马兰离家时的情况的。当列车载着马兰驰向西北高原的时候，她的心情是很复杂的：有着即将见到久别的丈夫的欢乐，也有着抛别老母幼儿的苦痛。秦怡细致地将人物复杂的情感传达了出来。她的强作欢笑的神情，她长久地伏在车窗上，注视着母亲和孩子渐渐远去的身影，说明她对这一老一小的亲人是多么依恋；而她凝望着车窗外旋转的田野和高山时，眼睛里闪着的兴奋的光芒，也显示出她多么盼望早些飞到建筑工地，飞到自己丈夫的身边。在列车的单调而有节奏的轰鸣中，她的激动的情感逐渐平静下来，而当她跟教导员相识以后，她就显得更开朗了。秦怡在表现人物情感的变化的时候，非常自然，没有给人矫揉造作的感觉。
    在另外一场戏——马兰烧焦了饭，引起丈夫的愤怒一场戏里面，秦怡的表演，也是很动人的。当马兰的丈夫嫌饭烧焦了，不愿吃饭，并且连马兰的碗也给夺下来的时候，她心里难受极了，但是她没有放声大哭，只缄默着，悄悄用手抹去了眼角上的泪。这个很小的动作，却把马兰坚毅的不易屈服的性格形象地表现了出来。马兰毕竟是爱自己的丈夫的，饭没做好，她心里很歉然，便把一个馒头递给丈夫，而且恳切地向他说，“让我再试试吧（指学开推土机）！我要是再学不会，就死了这条心！”秦怡在这场戏里，没有强调人物性格的任何一方面，而是把人物错综复杂的情感很好地揉合融汇起来的，因此她使我们感到马兰是一个真实的人，是一个在事业上有理想的人，在夫妻关系上深情的人。有些演员在创造角色的时候，常常只表现人物的“理智”，而不敢触及人物的内在感情，这样把艺术的魅力局限在几条正确的结论上，难道不就是产生概念化表演的原因之一么？
    有人认为秦怡在马兰这一形象的创造上，还有着一些知识分子的味道。我想，马兰既然是一个具有一些文化的城市家庭妇女，秦怡这样来表现还是可以的。但是，秦怡在某些动作的设计和选择上还不够精确。比如像马兰第一次在推土机上的几个镜头，她的惊讶的面部表情就嫌稍稍夸张；她送走丈夫以后和教导员边走边谈话的那节戏，情感的转折也还露出生硬的痕迹。
    在这里，我们期待着秦怡的新作——影片“铁道游击队”中的芳林嫂早日问世，并且预祝她在演员艺术创造上获得更大的成功。
