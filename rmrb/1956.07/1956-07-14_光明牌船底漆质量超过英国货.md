Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, July 12th: The "Guangming" brand antifouling paint successfully trial-produced by the Shanghai Kailin Paint Factory is of better quality than the world-renowned British Red Hand and Leaf brand antifouling paints.

    The "People No. 13" ocean liner, which was coated with this domestically produced antifouling paint last July, has been sailing at sea for a year, and the paint has not peeled off.

    The Kailin Paint Factory had previously applied their successfully trial-produced new paint and British Red Hand brand antifouling paint to iron sheets separately and placed them in the seawater of ports such as Qingdao, Zhoushan, Wenzhou, and Xiamen for testing. The erosive power of the seawater in these places is relatively strong, and the reproductive capacity of marine organisms such as barnacles, oysters, and bryozoans is also relatively high. The test results showed that the iron sheets coated with British Red Hand brand antifouling paint had mostly peeled, rusted, and some areas were even attached with marine organisms such as barnacles; while the iron sheets coated with domestically produced Guangming brand antifouling paint had no peeling, rusting, or marine organism attachment.

    The factory also compared this new product with the British Leaf brand antifouling paint, which was only imported this year. They simultaneously conducted accelerated tests in the factory's laboratory in artificially created seawater with even stronger erosive power. The test results proved that Guangming brand antifouling paint was better than British Leaf brand antifouling paint in terms of peeling, blistering, rusting, and antifouling properties.

    The Guangming brand antifouling paint was developed by the factory's technicians with reference to Soviet, British, American, and Japanese paint manufacturing data, and after soliciting opinions from technicians from major Shanghai paint factories. A total of sixty different formulations were made, and after experimental comparison and gradual elimination, a final formulation was selected.

### 光明牌船底漆质量超过英国货

    光明牌船底漆质量超过英国货
    据新华社上海12日电　上海开林油漆厂试制成功的光明牌船底漆，质量比世界闻名的英国红手牌、叶子牌船底漆还要好。
    “人民十三号”海轮，去年七月涂上这种国产船底漆，已经在海上航行了一年，油漆没有剥落。
    开林油漆厂曾经把他们试制成功的新油漆和英国红手牌船底漆分别涂在铁片上，放在青岛、舟山、温州、厦门等港的海水中进行试验。这些地方海水的侵蚀力较强，藤壶、牡蛎、苔藓虫等海生物繁殖力也较大。试验结果，涂上英国红手牌船底漆的铁片，已经大部分脱漆、生锈，有的地方还附着藤壶等海生物；而涂上国产光明牌船底漆的铁片，没有脱漆、生锈，也无海生物附着。
    这个厂又将这种新产品和今年才进口的英国叶子牌船底漆进行了比较。他们在厂内实验室侵蚀力更强的人造海水中，同时进行加速试验。试验的结果证明，光明牌船底漆在脱漆、起泡、生锈、防污等方面，都比英国叶子牌船底漆好。
    光明牌船底漆是这个厂技术人员参考了苏联、英国、美国和日本制漆的资料，并且征求了上海主要造漆厂技术人员的意见，共做了六十几种配方，经过试验比较，逐步淘汰，最后才选择出来的一种配方。
