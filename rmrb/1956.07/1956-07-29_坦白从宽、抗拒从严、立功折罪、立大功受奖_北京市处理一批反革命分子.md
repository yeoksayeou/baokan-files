Following the policy of "leniency for confession, strictness for resistance, merit offsets crime, and major merit is rewarded," the Beijing Municipal People's Procuratorate and the Beijing Municipal Intermediate People's Court recently handled a batch of counter-revolutionaries.

Among these counter-revolutionaries, there were not only counter-revolutionaries who had committed general historical crimes, but also blood-debtors, dispatched agents, hidden agents, and other active counter-revolutionaries with serious crimes. According to their crimes, they should all be dealt with according to the law. However, the majority of them received lenient treatment because they voluntarily surrendered themselves and thoroughly confessed their crimes. Only a very small number of counter-revolutionaries who persisted in their counter-revolutionary stance and refused to confess were punished by law.

Among the counter-revolutionaries who received lenient treatment, there was Zhang Guojing, a dispatched agent who surrendered himself and performed great meritorious service. During the Kuomintang rule, he served as the secretary-general of the Kuomintang Liaoyang Municipal Party Department. After the liberation of Shenyang, Zhang Guojing, on the one hand, confessed his reactionary identity to the People's Government, and on the other hand, secretly colluded with a small group of reactionary party and league backbone elements to secretly form a counter-revolutionary organization called the "Northeast Anti-Soviet Anti-Communist National Salvation Corps." In 1950, Zhang Guojing fled to Hong Kong and established relations with the US-Chiang Kai-shek secret service agencies such as the "Second Department of the Ministry of National Defense," the "Presidential Palace Archives," and the "Kuomintang Reform Committee," receiving secret service funds of 3,800 Hong Kong dollars. According to the instructions of the secret service agencies, he changed the "Northeast Anti-Soviet Anti-Communist National Salvation Corps" to the "Northeast Anti-Russian Anti-Communist National Salvation Corps." In 1950, Zhang Guojing once secretly returned to Beijing to deploy counter-revolutionary activities for the members of this organization. After June 1953, Zhang Guojing recruited agents for the US-Chiang Kai-shek secret service agencies and dispatched them to the mainland. At the end of December 1955, Zhang Guojing accepted the dispatch mission of two secret service systems under the Chiang Kai-shek secret service agency "National Security Bureau." With the dual identities of "North China Special Commissioner" and "Commissioner," he came to Beijing again to engage in espionage activities such as intelligence gathering and defection, sending military and economic intelligence to secret service agencies in Hong Kong four times and receiving secret service funds of 1,000 Hong Kong dollars sent by secret service agencies in Hong Kong four times. In the past six months, he saw the vigorous development of the socialist cause in the motherland and the consolidation of the people's democratic dictatorship, and he was frightened all day long, falling into a dead end. Under the persuasion of his relatives, Zhang Guojing finally surrendered himself to the People's Government on June 4 this year, confessed all his crimes, and reported nearly 20 major dispatched agents. According to the policy of "rewarding major meritorious service," the Beijing Municipal People's Procuratorate announced on July 21 this year that it would exempt Zhang Guojing from prosecution. The government also gave him material rewards and is helping him find employment.

Ji Yangtian, a hidden agent who was treated leniently by the government for his thorough confession and meritorious performance, joined the "Zhangjiakou Hidden Group of the North China Supervision Group of the Second Department of the Ministry of National Defense" of Chiang Kai-shek at the end of 1948, serving as an upper lieutenant telegraph operator, receiving a radio station and special agent activity funds, and had attempted to communicate with overseas secret service agencies twice. After liberation, he infiltrated the Beijing Municipal Telecommunications Bureau. For six years, Ji Yangtian was full of worries and dared not confess his crimes. During the suppression of counter-revolutionaries movement last year, after a fierce ideological struggle, Ji Yangtian took the initiative to confess and reported all the members of this hidden group he knew. In accordance with the policy of "merit offsets crime," the Beijing Municipal People's Procuratorate decided to exempt him from prosecution. Now Ji Yangtian is still working in his original position and salary in his original unit (Beijing Telegraph Bureau).

Active counter-revolutionary Chen Xun joined the "Zhejiang Southern People's Anti-Communist Alliance Ruian County Committee" in 1949; in 1950, he joined the bandit "Southeast People's Anti-Communist National Salvation Army" and was appointed as the "Mayu District" chief, attempting to cooperate with the US-Chiang Kai-shek counter-attack on the mainland, conspiring to establish a counter-revolutionary base, and had twice supported agents who sneaked into the mainland from coastal islands. In 1951, Chen Xun forged his resume, concealed his crimes, and infiltrated Peking University to study. In the suppression of counter-revolutionaries movement last year, he thoroughly confessed his crimes and reported all the counter-revolutionaries in the same case, with meritorious performance. The Beijing Municipal People's Procuratorate decided to exempt Chen Xun from prosecution. Now Chen Xun is still studying at Peking University.

Wang Jingcen, a military agent and blood-debtor, served as the military section chief of the pseudo-self-defense regiment headquarters in Daxing County and the deputy head of the pseudo-Tuanhe Township and the head of the intelligence team from 1945 to 1948, and participated in the military agent organization. He once led self-defense members to arrest and shoot Zhang Guangshu, an underground worker, on the orders of the pseudo-Daxing County magistrate and the military section chief. He also arrested four revolutionary workers and sent them to the pseudo-county government, and their whereabouts are still unknown. After the liberation of Beijing, he fled to Zhangjiakou and other places, hiding everywhere, unable to settle down. On September 9 last year, Wang Jingcen surrendered himself to the Supreme People's Procuratorate. According to the policy of "leniency for confession," the Beijing Municipal Intermediate People's Court only sentenced Wang Jingcen to three years in prison, suspended for three years, and deprived of political rights during the probation period.

At the same time, in accordance with the policy of "strictness for resistance," the Beijing Municipal People's Court legally punished Cao Yuwen, a dispatched agent who persisted in his counter-revolutionary stance and refused to confess. Cao Yuwen served as the pseudo-county magistrate of Yingshan County, Hubei Province during the Japanese puppet regime. In 1950, he fled to Hong Kong to rely on the American secret service agencies. In December 1954, he accepted the task of collecting military intelligence and sneaked into Beijing, sending military intelligence to the American secret service agencies in Hong Kong continuously. Last year, the Beijing Municipal Public Security Bureau arrested Cao based on conclusive evidence. The Beijing Municipal Intermediate People's Court sentenced Cao Yuwen to 15 years in prison in May this year.

    坦白从宽、抗拒从严、立功折罪、立大功受奖
    北京市处理一批反革命分子
    本报讯　北京市人民检察院和北京市中级人民法院，最近根据“坦白从宽、抗拒从严、立功折罪、立大功受奖”的政策，先后处理了一批反革命分子。
    在这些反革命分子当中，不仅有犯有一般历史罪行的反革命分子，而且有罪恶严重的血债分子、派遣特务、潜伏特务和其他现行反革命分子。论他们的罪恶，都是应该法办的。但是，他们中间的大多数由于主动地投案自首，彻底交代了罪行，所以受到了宽大处理。只有极少数坚持反革命立场、拒不坦白的反革命分子，受到了法律制裁。
    在一批受到宽大处理的反革命分子中，有投案自首并且立了大功的派遣特务分子张国镜。他在国民党统治时期，曾经担任过国民党辽阳市党部书记长。沈阳解放以后，张国镜一面向人民政府交代了他的反动身份，一面又暗地勾结一小撮反动党团骨干分子，秘密成立了所谓“东北抗苏反共救国团”的反革命组织，1950年，张国镜逃到香港，先后同“国防部二厅”“总统府资料室”“国民党改造委员会”等美蒋特务机关建立了关系，领取了特务经费三千八百元（港币），并且根据特务机关的指令，把“东北抗苏反共救国团”改为“东北抗俄反共救国团”。张国镜在1950年曾经一度潜回北京，对这个组织的成员进行了反革命活动的部署。1953年6月以后，张国镜替美蒋特务机关招募特务，向大陆派遣。1955年12月底，张国镜接受了蒋介石特务机关“国家安全局”所属两个特务系统的派遣任务，以所谓“华北区特派员”和“专员”的双重特务身份，又来到北京从事情报和策反等特务活动，先后向香港的特务机关发送军事、经济等情报四次，并且连续四次领取了香港特务机关寄来的特务经费一千元（港币）。半年以来，他看到祖国社会主义事业的蓬勃发展，看到人民民主专政的巩固，整天心惊胆跳，陷入走头无路的境地。在他的亲属的规劝下，张国镜终于在今年六月四日向人民政府投案自首，交代了自己的全部罪行，并且检举了重大的派遣特务近二十人。北京市人民检察院根据“立大功受奖”的政策，在今年七月二十一日宣告对张国镜免予起诉，政府还给了他物质奖励，并且正在帮助他就业。
    因为彻底坦白并且有立功表现而受到政府宽大处理的潜伏特务计养田，在1948年底参加了蒋介石“国防部二厅华北督导组张家口潜伏小组”担任上尉报务员，领到了一部电台和特务活动经费，并且曾经两次企图同海外特务机关试行通报。解放后，他混入了北京市电信局。六年来，计养田顾虑重重，不敢坦白交代自己的罪行。在去年肃反运动中，计养田经过激烈的思想斗争以后，主动地坦白了，并且检举了他所知道的这个潜伏小组的全部成员。北京市人民检察院本着“立功折罪”的政策，决定对他免予起诉。现在计养田仍旧原职原薪，继续在原单位（北京市电报局）工作。
    现行反革命分子陈珣，1949年参加了“浙南人民反共同盟瑞安县委员会”；1950年又参加了匪“东南人民反共救国军”，被任命为“马屿区”区长，妄图配合美蒋反攻大陆，阴谋建立反革命根据地，并且曾经两次策应从沿海岛屿潜入大陆的特务。1951年，陈珣伪造履历，隐瞒了罪行，混入北京大学学习。在去年肃反运动中，他彻底坦白了罪行，并且检举了同案全部反革命分子，有立功表现。北京市人民检察院决定对陈珣免予起诉。现在陈珣仍旧在北京大学学习。
    军统特务、血债分子王景岑，在1945年到1948年期间，先后担任大兴县伪自卫团总部的军事股长、伪团河乡副乡长兼情报组长，并且参加了军统特务组织。他曾经奉伪大兴县县长和军事科长的命令，率领自卫队员逮捕并且枪杀了我地下工作人员张广树，还逮捕过革命工作人员四人送伪县政府，到现在不知下落。北京解放以后，他逃到张家口等地，到处匿藏，不能安身。去年九月九日，王景岑到最高人民检察院投案自首。北京市中级人民法院根据“坦白从宽”的政策，只判处王景岑徒刑三年，缓期三年执行，缓刑期间剥夺政治权利。
    在这同时，北京市人民法院根据“抗拒从严”的政策，依法惩办了坚持反革命立场、拒不坦白的派遣特务分子曹玉霦。曹玉霦在日伪时期曾经任湖北省应山县伪县长，他在1950年逃到香港投靠美国特务机关，1954年12月接受搜集军事情报的任务后潜来北京，连续给香港的美国特务机关寄发了军事情报。去年，北京市人民公安机关根据确凿的证据依法逮捕了曹犯。北京市中级人民法院在今年五月判处了曹玉霦有期徒刑十五年。
