Xinhua News Agency Dispatch:

    Jiaozuo Coal Mine has achieved great success in eliminating miners' occupational diseases. In the first half of this year, many workers in this mining area who had lost their ability to work due to occupational diseases and were receiving labor insurance benefits have returned to production after recovering.
    In order to eliminate occupational diseases among miners, Jiaozuo Coal Mine conducted a physical examination of the miners and took measures to strengthen the treatment and prevention of various diseases suffered by the miners. Since last winter, the Jiaozuo Mining Bureau has built two artificial sulfur bath pools near the Wangfeng and Lifeng mines, and established a hot spring sanatorium in Wenquanji, Linru County, Henan Province. According to statistics from December of last year to the present, 153 of the 254 miners being treated for occupational diseases have been cured, and the conditions of the others have also improved. In order to eliminate miners' silicosis and gastrointestinal diseases, the Jiaozuo Mining Bureau, in addition to strengthening the treatment of those already suffering from the diseases, has also taken various measures to prevent these diseases from occurring. Since the first half of this year, the Mining Bureau has universally promoted water-flushing drills and the establishment of dedicated water-sprinkling personnel in its mines to control the flying of rock powder and coal dust in the mines. It has also added 36 hot water carts underground and established a system for the cafeteria to directly deliver hot meals to the workers working underground, so that the miners working underground can regularly drink hot water and eat hot meals in a timely manner. After taking these measures, the incidence of disease among miners has been greatly reduced. According to statistics from the Lifeng Mine, the incidence of gastrointestinal diseases among miners in the first half of this year decreased by 42.6% compared with the second half of last year.

    焦作煤矿采取措施消灭矿工职业病
    据新华社讯　焦作煤矿在消灭矿工职业病方面获得很大成绩。今年上半年，这个矿区有许多因为职业病失去了生产能力而享受劳保待遇的工人，在病愈后又参加了生产。
    焦作煤矿为了消灭矿工的职业病，曾经对矿工进行了一次体格检查，并且对矿工们所患的各种疾病采取了加强治疗和预防的措施。从去年冬季以来，焦作矿务局在所属的王封矿和李封矿附近，修建了两个人工硫磺浴池，并且在河南省临汝县温泉集设立了一个温泉疗养所。据从去年十二月份到现在的统计，治疗职业病的二百五十四名矿工，已经治愈的有一百五十三人，其余的病情也有好转。为了消灭矿工的矽肺病和肠胃病，焦作矿务局除对已经患病的人加强治疗以外，还采取各种措施防止这些疾病的发生。这个矿务局从今年上半年以来，在所属的矿井中，普遍推广了水湿风钻和设专人上水等办法，控制矿井中的岩粉和煤尘的飞扬，并且在井下增设了三十六个热水车，建立了食堂直接为井下生产的工人送热饭的制度，使井下生产的矿工都能经常地喝到热水，及时地吃到热饭。采取这些措施以后，矿工的发病率大大减少了。据李封矿的统计，今年上半年矿工肠胃病的发病率比去年下半年降低了42.6％。
