Two Scenes in "Tracking the Tiger's Den"
Su Fang

After watching "Tracking the Tiger's Den," I feel that the layout of this film is relatively well-thought-out, and the handling of certain scenes is also relatively meticulous. Therefore, it can attract the audience and make people concentrate from beginning to end.

In this film, I greatly appreciate the scene where the detective Li Yonghe, disguised and deep inside the "tiger's den," searches for the special agent roster hidden in the ancient painting scroll. After the special agent leader Cui Xizheng discovers it, he engages in a sharp struggle with him.

Cui Xizheng, who pretends to be progressive, is very cunning. When he found that things in the house had changed slightly, especially when the knot on the ancient painting scroll was loose, he immediately suspected Li Yonghe again and pressed Huang Yunmeng to tell him who Li Yonghe really was (because Li Yonghe was introduced to Cui Xizheng through the arrested Huang Yunmeng, disguised as the leader of another group of lurking agents). This subtle plot fully illustrates how cunning, clever, and keenly aware Cui Xizheng is; and his stern yelling and shameless threats to Huang Yunmeng vividly reveal the poisonous and brutal side of his nature.

When I saw Huang Yunmeng being interrogated to the point of almost being unable to answer in front of the murderous Cui Xizheng, I secretly sweated for him, worried that: what if Huang Yunmeng... But at this moment, Li Yonghe pushed the door open and came in. His appearance immediately changed the tense situation that was about to explode. He calmly admitted that he had moved things in the house. He sternly rebuked Cui Xizheng for being insincere to him. He claimed that if Cui Xizheng did not trust him, he would leave immediately. Li Yonghe was able to counterattack Cui Xizheng so fiercely because he had a full basis. Because he grasped the contradiction that Cui Xizheng, although suspicious of him, wanted to firmly grasp him in his hands in order to expand his own power through him. And Li Yonghe's sharp conversation and aggressive demeanor made Cui Xizheng have no room for defense, making Cui Xizheng completely passive, and finally had to bow his head and apologize. This clever handling method of making the play "turn from despair to hope" not only better reflects the agility and bravery of the people's detectives, but also introduces the audience into the realm of "when the mountains and rivers are exhausted and there seems to be no way out, the willows are dark and the flowers are bright, and there is another village."

The plot development of this scene is reasonable, and the actors' performances are also very moving. The actor who plays Li Yonghe is able to grasp the measure when expressing the character's grievances, angry and straightforward expression, without excessive movements and unnatural affectation. The actor who plays Cui Xizheng also fully portrays the face of a cunning and treacherous special agent leader from his initial frown and glare to his subsequent expressions of calling Li Yonghe brother and shaking hands and making peace.

Comparing this scene with a similar scene later—the scene where the airborne agent Sun Shigao "investigates" Li Yonghe—the latter is much inferior.

The special agent "special envoy" who sneaked into the mainland from Taiwan discovered that Li Yonghe's name was not in the roster collected by Cui Xizheng, became suspicious, and decided to "investigate" Li Yonghe again. So, late that night, he broke into Li Yonghe's bedroom. After being discovered by Li Yonghe, he immediately pretended to be a public security officer, saying that he wanted to learn about Cui Xizheng's situation from Li Yonghe. After Li Yonghe's ridicule and Cui Xizheng's persuasion, the two finally reconciled.

Logically speaking, Sun Shigao, as a special envoy, should be a more "experienced" agent than Cui Xizheng, but what this scene shows is that Sun Shigao seems to have broken into Li Yonghe's house rashly. If he went to search, it seems unlikely. Li Yonghe was sleeping in bed, wouldn't he be awakened? If he wanted to pretend to be a public security officer to deceive, he wouldn't pretend so clumsily: he exposed his "public security officer" identity to others as soon as he opened his mouth, and then talked about the "Korean War." It is difficult for the audience to imagine what method Sun Shigao wants to use to "investigate" Li Yonghe.

As for how Li Yonghe gained Sun Shigao's trust in this scene, it is also very vague. After Li Yonghe heard the words "Korean War," he immediately rebuked Sun Shigao, saying, "What! Korean War! I think you should go back to Taiwan and change your tongue!" Later, he directly called Sun Shigao "Sun" and ordered "get out." These mocking and instructive words of Li Yonghe, in addition to showing that he is very shrewd and has seen through Sun Shigao's trick, really cannot show his so-called "own people" identity. And his very rude attitude towards Sun Shigao seems to have exceeded the norm for treating "own people." So, why would Sun Shigao believe him? These are indeed puzzling. Therefore, although this scene seems very tense on the surface, after careful consideration, it feels false and untrue. (Attached picture)

    “虎穴追踪”里的两场戏
    苏方
    看完“虎穴追踪”以后，觉得这部影片的布局比较周密、某些场面的处理手法也比较细致，所以能够吸引观众，使人全神贯注地从头看到底。
    在这部影片里面，我很欣赏侦察员李永和化装深入“虎穴”、搜查了藏在古画画轴内的特务名册被特务头子崔希正发觉以后，跟他作尖锐斗争的一场戏。
    伪装进步的崔希正，是非常狡猾的。他发现屋里的东西稍有变样，特别是古画轴上的绳结松了的时候，就立刻又怀疑到李永和身上，并且追逼黄云梦说出李永和究竟是什么人来（因为李永和是通过已落网的黄云梦，化装为另一股潜伏的特务的首领介绍给崔希正的）。这一细微的情节，就充分说明崔希正是多么诡诈、机灵和具有多么敏锐的嗅觉；而他对于黄云梦的厉声的吆喝，无耻的威胁，也鲜明地揭示出他本性中毒辣、残暴的一面。
    当我看到在杀气腾腾的崔希正面前，黄云梦被逼问得几乎答不出话来的时候，确实暗地捏了一把汗，耽心着：万一黄云梦……但是就在这时候，李永和推门进来了。他一出现，使得这一触即发的紧张局面立刻为之一变。他坦然地承认屋里的东西是他动过的。他厉声斥责崔希正对他不真诚。他声称：如果崔希正不信任他，他就立刻离去。李永和能够这样狠狠地向崔希正反击，是有着充分依据的。因为他掌握住了崔希正虽然对他有所怀疑，但又想把他牢牢地抓在手里，以通过他扩大自己势力的矛盾。而李永和的锋利的谈吐，咄咄逼人的神态，也使得崔希正没有辩解的余地，使得崔希正完全陷于被动，最后不得不低头谢罪了。这种使戏“绝处逢生”的巧妙的处理方法，不仅更好地反映了人民侦察员的机敏，勇敢，也把观众引入“山穷水尽疑无路，柳暗花明又一村”的境界。
    这场戏的情节发展是合情合理的，演员的表演也很动人。李永和的扮演者在表现剧中人满怀委屈、愤怒直言的神态时，能够掌握分寸，没有过火的动作和不自然的矫饰。扮演崔希正的演员从他开始的一皱眉、一瞪眼以及后来跟李永和称兄道弟、握手言欢的表情，也充分把一个老奸巨猾的特务头子的面目刻划了出来。
    把这场戏和后面一场类似的戏——空降特务孙士高“考察”李永和的戏比较，后者就显得逊色不少。
    从台湾潜入大陆的特务“特派员”发现崔希正收藏的名册里没有李永和的名字，起了疑心，决定要再“考察”李永和一下。于是当天深夜他闯入了李永和的卧室。被李永和发现以后，他就立刻伪装成公安人员，说要向李永和了解崔希正的情况，经过李永和一番嘲弄和崔希正的劝解，最后两人和好了。
    按理说，作为特派员的孙士高，应该是比崔希正更有“经验”的特务，但是这场戏所表现出来的，孙士高到李永和屋里去，似乎是贸然地就闯进去的。如果说他去是为了搜查，似乎不大可能。李永和就睡在床上，难道他不会惊醒过来吗？如果说他想伪装成公安人员去进行哄骗，也不会伪装得如此拙劣：一开口就向别人暴露自己的“公安人员”的身份，接着又说什么“韩战”。孙士高究竟想用什么方法来“考察”李永和呢？观众就很难想像了。
    至于在这一场戏里，李永和如何取得孙士高的信任，也表现得很模糊。李永和听见“韩战”两字以后，立刻就斥责孙士高说，“什么！韩战！我看你还是回到台湾换个舌头去吧！”后来又直呼孙士高为“姓孙的”，并且命令“出去”。李永和的这些带嘲弄和教训意味的说话，除了表明他这个人很精明，已经识破了孙士高的诡计外，实在不能表明他的所谓“自己人”的身份。而他对于孙士高的非常不逊的态度，似乎超越了对待“自己人”的常轨。那么，孙士高凭什么会相信他呢？这些确实令人费解。因此这场戏表面看来虽很紧张，仔细推敲一下以后，就觉得虚假而不真实了。（附图片）
