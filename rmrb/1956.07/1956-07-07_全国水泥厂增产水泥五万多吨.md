    National Cement Plants Increase Cement Production by More Than 50,000 Tons

    (Our newspaper reports) Cement plants under the Ministry of Building Materials Industry overfulfilled their production plans for the first half of the year, increasing cement production by 53,872 tons, an increase of 11.13% compared to the same period last year. Based on the annual plan formulated this year to complete the First Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule, 51.6% of the annual plan has been completed.

    The main methods used by various cement plants to complete the plan are to promote advanced experiences and adopt new technologies. For example, as a result of promoting long-term safe operation experience, the cement kiln operation cycle has increased from an average of 38.5 days last year to 79.37 days. Jiangnan Cement Plant's No. 1 kiln has always been a model for cement kilns nationwide. By the end of June, it had been operating safely for 505 days, an increase of 37.6% compared to last year's national high record of 367 days. The average kiln operation cycle of Fushun Cement Plant in the first half of last year was 11.1 days, but in January to May of this year, it increased two and a half times compared to the same period last year. For another example, by mixing blast furnace slag into the raw materials to produce cement, not only was the output greatly increased, but also the cost was reduced. According to the results of the trial period at Fushun Cement Plant, the output increased by 17.02%, coal consumption decreased by 14.32%, and raw material consumption quota decreased by 10.46%.

    Currently, the Ministry of Building Materials Industry is continuing to organize the promotion of various advanced experiences and new technologies to ensure the completion and overfulfillment of the annual plan.

    全国水泥厂增产水泥五万多吨
    本报讯　建筑材料工业部所属水泥厂超额完成上半年的生产计划，增产水泥53，872吨，产量比去年同期增长了11.13％。从今年制定的提前完成第一个五年计划的年计划看，已完成年计划51.6％。
    各水泥厂完成计划的主要方法是推广先进经验和采用新技术。例如，推广长期安全运转经验的结果，水泥窑运转周期由去年的平均38.5天，提高到79.37天。江南水泥厂的一号窑一直是全国水泥窑的榜样，到六月底已安全运转505天，比去年全国最高的新纪录——367天提高37.6％。抚顺水泥厂去年上半年窑的运转周期平均是11.1天，而今年一至五月份即比去年同期提高了两倍半。又如由于把高炉矿渣掺入原料生产水泥，不但大大地提高了产量，而且降低了成本。根据抚顺水泥厂试用期间的结果看，即提高产量17.02％、降低煤消耗量14.32％、生料消耗定额降低10.46％。
    现在，建筑材料工业部正继续组织推广各种先进经验和新技术，来保证完成和超额完成年度计划。
