Even Production Funding Difficulties are Not Feared
    (Our Newspaper Report) Agricultural production cooperatives in Xishui County, Hubei Province, have summarized the work of summer harvest pre-distribution and mobilized members to comprehensively develop agricultural and sideline production. The summer harvest pre-distribution in Xishui County has been basically calculated to the household. According to the principle of "more work, more gain, less deduction, more distribution," more than 75% of the income is distributed to the members, ensuring that the vast majority of members increase their income. Currently, agricultural cooperatives in various regions need to purchase large quantities of fertilizers and pest control machinery to ensure the good growth of crops such as cotton and rice. However, after the implementation of "less deduction and more distribution," varying degrees of funding difficulties have occurred in agricultural cooperatives in various regions. In order to solve this problem, according to the instructions of the Xishui County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, agricultural cooperatives in various regions have widely and deeply mobilized members to develop diversified operations and save on investment based on the summary education of summer harvest distribution. After a rational arrangement of labor, the Victory Agricultural Cooperative of Wangcheng Township carried out nine sideline productions such as processing and oil extraction, kiln firing, and duck raising. It is estimated that the annual income can be more than 5,800 yuan, and more than 1,800 yuan can be earned before harvesting rice, which can basically solve the funding difficulties for purchasing production materials. In order to save production investment, agricultural cooperatives in various regions are carrying out a vigorous summer fertilizer accumulation campaign, accumulating a large amount of natural fertilizer by cutting green grass, composting, and digging turf. General cooperatives can save one-quarter to one-half of their annual production investment.

    生产资金困难也不怕
    本报讯　湖北省浠水县农业生产合作社通过总结夏收预分的工作，发动社员全面开展农副业生产。浠水县的夏收预分已基本计算到户，根据“多劳多得，少扣多分”的原则，把75％以上的收入分配到社员手中，保证了绝大部分社员增加收入。目前各地农业社为了保证棉花、水稻等作物良好生长，需要购买大批肥料和除虫药械等；但是，实行“少扣多分”之后，各地农业社都发生了程度不同的资金困难，为了解决这个问题，根据中共浠水县委的指示，各地农业社在夏收分配总结教育的基础上，广泛深入的发动社员开展多种经营和节约投资。望城乡胜利农业社，经过合理安排劳力，进行加工榨油、烧窑、养鸭等九项副业生产后，预计全年可收入五千八百多元，在收割稻谷以前，可以收入一千八百多元，基本上可以解决购买生产资料的资金困难。为了节约生产投资，各地农业社正在开展一个声势浩大的夏季积肥运动；用割青草、沤堆肥、挖地皮等办法积了大批自然肥料，一般的社可以节约全年生产投资四分之一到二分之一。
