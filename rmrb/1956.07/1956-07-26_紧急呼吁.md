    Urgent Appeal
    A large quantity of materials imported by the Xinjiang Petroleum Administration through the Horgos and Sandahe Wharf ports from foreign countries has been piled up on the mountains at the wharf ports since last winter and has not been processed as of June this year.  At the Horgos port, there are more than 4,000 tons of various oil well casings and drill pipes, and more than 20 large machines such as diesel engines and mud pumps for various drilling operations. At the Sandahe Wharf, there are more than 5,000 tons of various casings and drill pipes, more than 6,680 tons of barite, and more than 540 tons of cement for water injection wells.

    According to past experience, the Ili River will flood after the end of July, often rising above the riverbanks of the wharf. If these materials are still not processed by then, the state property will suffer significant losses. We suggest that the Xinjiang Petroleum Administration quickly organize forces to process these materials.

    Editor's note: The Xinjiang Transportation Bureau and the Xinjiang Petroleum Administration should quickly find a way to transport these materials out.

    紧急呼吁
    新疆石油管理局经霍尔果斯和三道河码头两口岸从国外进口的大批物资，从去年冬天起就一直堆积在码头口岸山上，直到今年六月份还没有处理。堆积在霍尔果斯口岸的有各种油井用的套管和钻管四千多吨，有各种钻井用的柴油机和泥浆泵等大型机器二十多台；堆积在三道河码头上的有各种套管和钻管五千多吨，重晶石六千六百八十多吨，注井用水泥五百四十多吨。
    根据往年经验，七月底以后，伊犁河就要涨水，常常涨到码头河岸以上，如果到那时这批物资仍没有处理，就会使国家财产受到重大损失。我们建议新疆石油管理局赶快组织力量处理这批物资。
