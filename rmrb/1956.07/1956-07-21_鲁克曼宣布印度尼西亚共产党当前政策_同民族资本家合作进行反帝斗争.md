Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, July 19th: The Indonesian "People's Daily" reported today that the Deputy Secretary-General of the Indonesian Communist Party, Lukman, told the press on July 18th that the goal of the Indonesian Communist Party's struggle at this stage is to cooperate with national capitalists to fight against foreign capitalism and imperialism, not to eliminate national capitalism.

He said that this does not mean that the Indonesian Communist Party is unaware that capitalism—whether national or foreign—also exploits workers. The Indonesian Communist Party is also very clear that there are contradictions between workers and national capitalists. However, besides these contradictions, they also have the same interests in the struggle against foreign imperialism and in consolidating Indonesia's independence.

Lukman said that in the current stage of the Indonesian revolution, the Communist Party can tolerate minor exploitation of workers by national capitalists.

Lukman pointed out that, therefore, the contradictions between workers and national capitalists should not be of an antagonistic nature, but should be reconciled in order to achieve the urgently needed cooperation and unity to fight against imperialism. He said that in the current stage of the revolution, his party will support the efforts of national capitalists to seek government protection to compete with large foreign capitalists.

He continued that as long as capitalism still exists and the socialism that the Communist Party and the general progressive people yearn for has not yet been realized, the exploitation of workers can only be limited or alleviated at best. In order to alleviate or limit the exploitation of capitalists, the Indonesian Communist Party is striving to secure the recognition of general democratic rights, especially the right of workers to strike.

    鲁克曼宣布印度尼西亚共产党当前政策
    同民族资本家合作进行反帝斗争
    新华社雅加达19日电　印度尼西亚“人民日报”今天报道，印度尼西亚共产党副总书记鲁克曼七月十八日对报界说，印度尼西亚共产党现阶段的斗争的目标是同民族资本家合作来对外国资本主义和帝国主义进行斗争，而不是消除民族资本主义。
    他说，这并不意味着印度尼西亚共产党没有注意到资本主义——不论是民族资本主义或是外国资本主义——同样剥削劳动者。印度尼西亚共产党也很清楚地知道：现在工人和民族资本家之间存在着矛盾。但是除了这种矛盾以外，他们在反对外国帝国主义的斗争中和巩固印度尼西亚的独立的事业中也存在着相同的利益。
    鲁克曼说，在印度尼西亚革命的现阶段，共产党可以容忍民族资本家对工人的轻微剥削。
    鲁克曼指出，因此，工人和民族资本家之间的矛盾不应当具有敌对性质，而应当加以调和，以便实现迫切需要的合作和团结来对帝国主义进行斗争。他说，在革命的现阶段，他的党将支持民族资本家争取政府的保护来同外国大资本家进行竞争的努力。
    他接着说，在资本主义还存在，而共产党和一般进步人民所向往的社会主义还没有实现的时候，对工人的剥削充其量只能加以限制或减轻。为了减轻或限制资本家的剥削，印度尼西亚共产党正在努力争取承认一般的民主权利，特别是工人罢工的权利。
