    A School for Remolding Capitalists
    By our correspondent Xi Ping
    The building on Hong Kong Road in Shanghai, formerly the Financial Association, has suddenly become lively. In the morning, as the city's clamor just begins, various vehicles carry groups of people from all corners of Shanghai to this place. They are capitalists from all walks of life in Shanghai, and a small number are family members of capitalists. It turns out that this building now houses China's first school to help capitalists reform themselves—the Shanghai Industry and Commerce Political School.
    After the complete public-private partnership of private industry and commerce in Shanghai, more and more industrialists and businessmen urgently demanded more systematic political theory study. Thus, the Shanghai Industry and Commerce Political School was born at the end of April this year. The school is led by the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and sponsored by the Shanghai Federation of Industry and Commerce and the Shanghai Branch of the China Democratic National Construction Association. The Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China gave strong support and assistance. Currently, the more than 2,000 students entering the school are the first batch of students. In the future, sixteen branch schools will be set up successively, with plans to allow more than 90,000 industrialists, businessmen, and some family members in the city to study in turn within two years.
    One morning, I visited this new type of school. All the students in the school are organized into twenty classes. The class teachers and group leaders who lead the study are elected by the students. The students have also formed a school life committee to lead extracurricular study and recreational activities for all students. The courses in the school are taught by university professors, scholars, and some responsible comrades. In addition to attending classes, they also have a considerable amount of time for full and free discussion. The atmosphere of free discussion can be felt everywhere in the school, whether on the wall newspapers of each class, in the class and group study discussion meetings, or in daily conversations. School staff told me that not long ago, when they studied the issue of capitalist exploitation, almost all classes in the school launched debates. Some believed that capitalists were not exploiters, while others believed that capitalists were exploiters. Both sides listed many facts for heated debate, and even some who had never spoken before spoke up. In order to ensure the full development of this free discussion, the school also stipulates that no one is allowed to be "labeled" or satirized in the discussion, and those with different opinions are allowed to reserve them. The truth becomes clearer through debate. Through this free discussion and mutual education, the effect is very good, allowing many industrialists and businessmen to clarify problems that they had not been able to figure out for a long time.
    With the introduction of the school staff, I visited a student named Chen Yuanqin, who is the private director of the Shanghai Public-Private Joint China Plush Factory. This capitalist, who is only in his forties, has spent twenty years running capitalist enterprises. Chen Yuanqin told me frankly: "Before liberation, I was a capitalist who ran the business quite well, and the factory had a surplus every year. After liberation, I saw from many facts that capitalists had an exploitative side, but I always felt that I could not be considered a complete exploiter myself. I thought: I used to go to the factory early and late every day to work, and I never interrupted it. Isn't this labor? In this study, I truthfully talked about this idea. Although, after the explanation and analysis of many classmates, I felt that their reasons could not convince me, so I insisted on my opinion. Not long ago, our class held a relatively large debate meeting. At this meeting, a classmate's opinion convinced me. His opinion made me realize this truth: From the phenomenon, capitalists participate in labor, but the capitalist's participation in labor is only to supervise the workers' labor, and its purpose is to occupy more of the workers' surplus value. Therefore, it is essentially different from the worker's labor—creating social wealth." Chen Yuanqin said: "When I realized the truth, I gave up my original wrong opinion. It is a pleasure to really solve the problem in thought." In my conversation with Chen Yuanqin, I was reminded of an old Chinese saying: "No destruction, no construction." Destroying capitalism makes it possible to build socialism, and admitting exploitation prepares for abandoning exploitation in thought.
    When I visited the school, many students spoke to me with satisfaction about the rich learning life and flexible teaching methods in the school. The students told me that in addition to classes and discussions, the school also conducts extracurricular tutoring activities and figurative education. For example, when teaching "Love the great motherland" and "The working class is the leading class in our country," they were organized to visit the "Exhibition of the History of the Shanghai Workers' Movement Struggle" and the exhibition of Shanghai's advanced production experience at the Workers' Cultural Palace. Facts are always the most convincing, especially after they began to understand some knowledge of the laws of social development in the classroom and in group meetings, and then they went to see these physical exhibitions, which inspired them even more. The blood-stained clothes of martyr Wang Xiaohe at the time of his martyrdom in the exhibition hall, and the pictures of the heroic struggle of the workers, deeply moved many people.
    I heard many interesting stories in this school. The school staff once told me about the story of "mother and son classmates" circulating in the school. Chen Yueying, a student in the family class, and Xu Dunchu, a student in the fourth class, were originally mother and son. Xu Dunchu used to be a small boss who enjoyed eating, drinking, and playing. After liberation, he didn't care much about the factory's production. His mother was dissatisfied with her son and had separated from him long ago. Now, both mother and son are participating in political studies at the Industry and Commerce Political School. In the morning, Xu Dunchu came to his mother's house with his briefcase, inviting his mother to go to school together. In the evening, the mother and son checked their study notes together and prepared their speaking outlines. Chen Yueying's husband, Xu Benpei, was really happy to see his mother and son studying at the Political School together. The family was reunited in harmony.
    I visited the wall newspapers written by each class in the school, which were also full of a new atmosphere of life. The content of the wall newspapers is rich, including learning experiences, free debates on a question, cartoons, poems, and news reports of various cultural and sports activities. On the wall newspaper of one class, I saw a poem written by Chai Zhixiang, an old student who is already fifty-nine years old. In the poem, he described his happy situation in participating in learning.
    On the wall newspaper of another class, I saw a "Holiday Travelogue" written by a study group. One Sunday, this group collectively visited the suburbs, visited an agricultural production cooperative, and held a picnic. Recreational activities in the school are very active, with various ball games, singing competitions, and even games such as "The Eagle Catches Chickens" being played, as if people have restored their childhood.
    When I finished my visit to the Shanghai Industry and Commerce Political School, I thought of a passage that Cao Diqiu, Deputy Secretary of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, said at the opening ceremony of the school. He said: The emergence of this school "is a pioneering initiative in Shanghai's history. It is only possible to run such a school under the specific historical conditions of our country, which is carrying out socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce by peaceful methods. This is the victory of the Party's policy and the result of the initial mastery of their own destiny by industrialists and businessmen." Many facts in this school precisely illustrate this point.

    一座改造资本家的学校  
    本报记者　习平
    上海香港路原金融公会的大楼门前，现在突然变得热闹起来了。早晨，当城市的喧嚣刚刚开始，各种车辆载着一群群的人，从上海市的各个角落来到这里。他们是上海各行各业的资本家，也有一小部分是资本家的家属。原来，这座大楼里现在设立着中国第一座帮助资本家进行自我改造的学校——上海市工商界政治学校。
    上海市私营工商业全部公私合营以后，越来越多的工商业者迫切要求进行比较系统地政治理论学习，这样，上海市工商界政治学校便在今年四月底诞生了。这个学校由政协上海市委员会领导，由上海市工商业联合会、中国民主建国会上海分会主办。中共上海市委给予了大力的支持和协助。目前进入学校学习的二千多人是第一期学员，大部分是工商界中的骨干分子，以后将陆续分设十六个分校，计划在两年内，使全市九万多工商业者和部分家属都能轮流学习一次。
    在一个早晨，我访问了这个新型的学校。全校学员被组成二十个班，领导学习的班主任、小组长，都是学员中推选出来的，学员们还组成了一个学校生活委员会，领导全校学生课外学习和文娱活动。学校里的课程，是请大学的教授、学者和一些负责同志来讲授的。他们除了听课以外，还有相当多的时间来充分地进行自由讨论。自由讨论的空气在学校里到处都可以感觉到，无论是在各班的墙报上，在班组学习讨论会上，在日常的闲谈中。学校的工作人员告诉我，不久前，他们学习到关于资本主义的剥削问题的时候，全校各班几乎都展开了辩论，有的认为资本家不是剥削者，有的认为资本家是剥削者，双方列举了许多事实热烈辩论，连一些过去从来不发言的也发了言。学校里为了保证这种自由讨论的充分展开，还规定在讨论中不许给人“戴帽子”，不许打击讽刺，有不同意见的人允许他保留。真理是越辩越清楚的，通过这种自由讨论和相互教育，效果很好，使不少工商业者弄清了过去长期没有搞清楚的问题。
    在学校工作人员介绍下，我访问了一个叫陈元钦的学员，他是上海公私合营中国毛绒厂的私方厂长。这个现年才四十多岁的资本家，有二十年的时间是在经营资本主义企业。陈元钦坦率地告诉我：“解放前，我是一个经营得不坏的资本家，厂里每年都有盈余；解放后，我从许多事实中，看到资本家有剥削的一面，可是总感到我自己不能算是完全的剥削者。我想：我过去每天起早落晚到厂工作，从来没有中断过，这不是劳动吗？在这次学习中我就把这种思想如实地谈出来了，虽然，经过许多同学的解释和分析，我觉得他们的理由不能使我信服，因此，我就坚持了我的意见。不久前，我们班里召开了一个较为大型的辩论会，在这个会上，有个同学提出的意见使我信服了。他的意见使我认识到这样一条真理：从现象上来看，资本家是参加劳动的，但是，资本家参加劳动只是为了监督工人劳动，其目的却是为了更多的占有工人的剩余价值，因此和工人的劳动——创造社会财富，有本质的不同。”陈元钦说：“当我认识了真理以后，我就放弃了原来的错误意见。真正在思想上解决了问题，这是一种愉快。”在和陈元钦的谈话中，使我想到中国的一句古话：“不破不立。”破掉资本主义，就有可能建立社会主义，承认了剥削，就为放弃剥削作了思想上的准备。
    我在学校访问的时候，许多学员都用满意的口吻和我谈到学校里丰富的学习生活和灵活的教学方法。学员们告诉我，学校里除了上课和讨论以外，还进行课外的辅导活动和形象化的教育。例如在讲授
  “热爱伟大的祖国”、“工人阶级是我国的领导阶级”的时候，组织他们到工人文化宫参观了“上海工人运动斗争史”展览和上海先进生产经验的展览。事实总是最有说服力的，特别是当他们在课堂和小组会里开始懂得了一些社会发展规律的知识以后，再去看这些实物展览，启发就更大。展览室里的王孝和烈士殉难时的血衣，工人英勇斗争的图片，使许多人深受感动。
    在这个学校里我听到了许多有趣的故事，学校里的工作人员，曾经和我谈到学校里流传的关于“母子同学”的佳话。家属班的学员陈月英和第四班的学员徐敦础，原来是母子。徐敦础过去是个吃喝玩乐的小老板，解放后也不大管厂里的生产，母亲对儿子不满，很早就分居了。现在，母子俩人都参加了工商界政治学校的政治学习，早晨，徐敦础挟着皮包到母亲家里来，邀请母亲一齐去学校，晚上，母子俩人一同核对学习笔记、准备发言提纲。陈月英的丈夫徐本培，看到他们母子俩人一同进政治学校学习，真是高兴。家庭重新和睦团结了。
    我参观了学校各班自己编写的墙报，这里也充满着新的生活气息。墙报的内容是丰富的，有学习体会，有关于一个问题的自由辩论，有漫画、诗歌，也有各种文化体育活动的消息报道。在一个班的墙报上，我看到一个年已五十九岁的老学员柴志香写的诗，他在诗里描述了他参加学习的愉快情景。
    在另一个班的墙报上，我看到一个学习小组写的“假日游记”。一个星期天，这个小组集体游玩了郊区，访问了农业生产合作社，举行了野餐。学校里文娱活动非常活跃，经常举行各种球类、歌咏比赛，甚至还玩“老鹰捉小鸡”之类的游戏，人们就像恢复了他们的童年时代一样。
    当我结束在上海工商界政治学校参观的时候，我想起了中共上海市委副书记曹荻秋在学校开学典礼上说的一段话。他说：这个学校的出现，“是上海历史上的一个创举，只有在以和平方法对资本主义工商业进行社会主义改造的我国特定历史条件下，才有可能开办这样的学校，这是党的政策的胜利和工商业者初步掌握了自己命运的结果。”这个学校的许多事实，正是说明了这一点。
