　  Trial Assembly of Cars in July
    (Our newspaper dispatch) The First Automobile Manufacturing Plant will trial assemble cars in July.
    Currently, the entire plant is actively preparing for the trial assembly of cars. On June 20th, the engine workshop began continuous material input on some production lines, implementing assembly line production. This workshop adjusted production the fastest, having trial-assembled fifteen engines in May and assembled thirty in June. A batch of car part blanks produced by the foundry workshop have been sent to the machining workshop for processing. The forging workshop has forged the majority of car parts, and the important car parts - crankshaft, front beam, and steering knuckle - have also been forged. The work of assembling the car chassis assembly in the chassis workshop is progressing rapidly. The process department and the technical sections of each workshop are checking and modifying process data, striving to draw process conclusions as soon as possible. The steel and collaborative products needed for the car are being transported to the First Automobile Plant one after another.
