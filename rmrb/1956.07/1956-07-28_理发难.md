Title: The Difficulty of Getting a Haircut

It's a mess—my hair, that is. Sweat, dirt, all stuck together, impossible to comb. I decided to go to the barbershop for a trim.

After getting off work, I rushed to the Dongdan First Barber Shop, but ran into a brick wall as soon as I walked in. The people there said, "We're all booked up for today. Please come early another day!" I went to Dingxin next door, and the situation was even worse. A small room was packed full of people, and the person handing out numbers said: The moment we opened this morning, we handed out all the numbers for the whole day in just over ten minutes. Retreating from Dingxin, I turned to Capital, and as soon as I stepped over the threshold, I heard a customer grumbling impatiently: "I've been waiting for hours, and I still haven't gotten a haircut." If it's crowded in the Eastern District, maybe it'll be better in the Western District! I held onto a glimmer of hope and hurriedly went to Xidan, asking at every barbershop, but the answer was always the same: No appointments.

Finally, Sunday arrived, and I got up early, rushing to the Meibai Barber Shop a little after seven. From a distance, I saw a group of people lining up. I thought they were waiting to buy something good. But when I got closer, I saw it was a group of women waiting to get their hair done. Some were heavily pregnant, and others were holding children. This time, I wasn't going anywhere. I would just have to wait in line!

The door opened, and I went inside, waiting aimlessly. There were so many people. Later arrivals couldn't even find a place to stand, let alone sit. Early in the morning, the room was as stuffy as a steamer. Although the electric fan was spinning furiously, you couldn't feel a bit of wind. Still, people stubbornly waited for hours and hours.

The people around me started having lively conversations. One said she had taken the first bus from the suburbs, another said she had come three times already and had never been able to get in.

"Isn't there a barbershop on your street?"

"There is, but the equipment isn't good, and it's not clean. And a perm costs 1.5 yuan. It costs about the same amount of money, so who wants to go to those small shops?"

A female comrade who was getting a perm asked the barber:

"How much would it cost to curl it after the perm?"

"No extra charge. It's still 1.8 yuan."

"Then please curl it for me after the perm."

A female customer next to her chimed in, "They used to spray a fragrant lotion on your hair after a haircut. Why don't they do that anymore? Actually, the bigger barbershops could raise their prices a bit and restore the old features. Those who want to make their hair look nicer would pay more money. Isn't that the best of both worlds—quality for price?"

This question piqued my interest, so I asked a worker named Li Jigang about it. He said, "That's right. The price of a haircut just isn't set properly. For example, it costs 50 cents for men to get a haircut, shampoo, blow-dry, shave, and hair oil. But just a blow-dry with some hair oil costs 45 cents. Some people don't plan on getting a haircut and shave when they come in, but when they hear the price is the same, they change their minds and ask for a haircut and shave too."

He continued, "Barbershops in Beijing are divided into six grades, with different equipment, but there's only a five-cent difference between each grade. Since it costs about the same, who doesn't want to go to the big shops with the better skills?"

Li Jigang has a fellow villager who opened a Gexin Barber Shop on Nanxiao Street, and he doesn't get many customers in a day. I heard that many small shops are like that. But the people in the big shops are busy until ten or eleven o'clock at night every day. Some even can't finish at that time, so that one gets sick today and another collapses tomorrow. Some workers even faint on their feet while they're working.

I noticed that even though the room was so crowded and the barbers were so busy, there were several chairs that were always empty. Other big shops also have this strange phenomenon.

Li Jigang said that the workers now work in shifts, and each shift has several people off work. "We can find ways to keep the chairs from being idle," he continued. "Some people are always complaining that there aren't enough people, but actually, there are people in the shop, they just haven't been put in the right place." He mentioned several assistants by name, saying that their skills are no worse than some of the regular barbers, but they have never been promoted. They came to the shop as assistants years ago, even decades ago, and they're still doing the work of assistants. For example, Ren Lingkui, an assistant in the women's section, can cut, perm, and curl hair in various styles, and he does it quite well. But for decades he has been paid assistant wages, so he has no motivation to work. When someone talks to him about improving his skills, he complains, "Why should I learn if I get the same amount of money whether I learn or not!" Li Jisheng, another barber in the shop, also said that some of the janitors are already qualified to be assistants, but they still spend their days sweeping and wiping chairs.

After seeing these phenomena and hearing these words, a series of questions appeared in my mind: Why can't the price differences between barbershop grades be widened? Why can't the shops with slightly worse equipment be improved? Why can't the prices for haircuts be set more reasonably? Why can't workers be paid according to their actual skills? Why? Why?

    理发难
    本报记者　傅冬
    头发脏得不像话了，又是汗，又是土，粘成一团，梳都梳不开。我决定去理发馆理一理。
    下班以后，我跑到东单第一理发馆，那知道一进门就碰了个钉子，店里的人说：“今天没位子了，改天请早来吧！”跑到隔壁鼎新一看，情形更不好，一间不大的房子里挤得满满的，发牌号的人说：早上一开门，十几分钟的时间里就把一天的牌号统统发完了。从鼎新退出来转到首都，刚跨过门槛，就听见一位顾客不耐烦地在嘟囔：“我等了好几个钟头了，还理不上。”东城挤，西城也许好一点吧！我抱着一丝希望急急忙忙赶到西单，挨着个儿把理发馆问了一遍，回答都是一样的：没位子。
    好容易盼到星期天，我起了个早，七点多就匆匆赶去美白理发馆。远远地看见一群人在排队。我以为是在等买什么好东西呢？走近一看，原来是一群妇女在排队等理发。有的人挺着个大肚子，有的手里还拉着个孩子。这一次，我可不走了，排就排吧！
    门开了，我进到店里，无聊地等着。人真多，后来的人，别说找坐处，连站都没地方站。一大早，房子里就闷得像蒸笼似的，虽然电扇一个劲儿地扇着，可一丝儿风也感不到，但是人们仍硬着头皮几个钟头几个钟头地等着。
    旁边的人开始了热烈的谈话。这个说她是坐头班汽车从郊外赶来的，那个说她已来了三次了，一直等不着。
    “你们住的那条街没理发馆吗？”
    “有是有，但设备不好，又不干净，烫一次发还要一块五，花的钱差不多，谁愿去那些小铺子理呢？”
    一个正在烫发的女同志问理发员：
    “烫了再卷卷要多少钱？”
    “不加钱，还是一块八。”
    “那呆会儿烫完给我卷一卷。”
    旁边一个女客插进来说：“早先理完发头上给洒一种有香味的药水，现在怎么都没了？其实大理发馆可以加点价，把旧有的特点恢复了。谁想把头发弄得漂亮些，谁就多花些钱。优质优价有多好呢？”
    这个问题引起了我的兴趣，就向一位叫李继刚的工人打听了一下。他说：“可不是，理发的价钱就是订得不合适。比如，男同志又理又洗又吹风又刮脸又上油是五毛钱，光吹吹上点油倒要四毛五。有好些人进门时并不打算推头和刮脸的，一听到价钱一样，临时变卦又要推又要刮脸了。”
    他接着说，北京的理发馆一共分六级，设备不同，但一级和一级之间却只差五分钱。花的钱差不多，谁不想去手艺好的大铺子理呢？
    李继刚有个乡亲在南小街开了个阁新理发店，一天就理不上几个头。听说好些小铺都是这样。可大铺子的人每天忙到夜里十点、十一点，有的到时还完不了，弄得今天这个病了，明天那个躺倒了。有些工人正作着作着活就晕得站不住了。
    我注意到屋子里这样挤，理发师这样忙，可是有几个椅子一直空着。其他几个大铺子里也有这种怪现象。
    李继刚说，工人们现在分班干活，每班都有几个人歇工。“椅子可以想法不让它闲着，”他接着说，“有些人成天嚷嚷没人哪没人哪！实际上店里就有现成的，只是没放到合适的地方就是了。”他举出几个助手的名字，说这些人的手艺并不比一些正式的理发师低多少，可是一直没提拔。几年前甚至十几年前他们进店的时候是助手，现在还干的是助手的活。像女部的助手任伶魁，能剪电烫头发，也能卷各种花样，而且作的还挺不错，可十几年来他一直拿的助手的工钱，这样他干得就没劲了。有人给他谈起提高技术的话，他就发牢骚：“不学拿这么点钱，学了也拿这么些钱，学它干什么！”在店里的另一个理发员李济生也说，有些勤杂工，早就够上助手的标准了，可他们成天还是扫地擦椅子。
    看了这么些现象，听了这么些话，我脑子里出现了一大串问题：为什么不能把理发馆的等级差价拉得大一些？为什么不能把设备稍差的铺子改善改善？为什么不把理发的价钱订得合理一点？为什么不能按工人的真正手艺给工资？为什么？为什么？
