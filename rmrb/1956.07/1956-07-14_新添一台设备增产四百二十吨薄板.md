Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 12th. The "Non-Stop Up and Down Sleeve Connection" equipment jointly developed by technician Zhou Zhenya and veteran worker Ruan Chengpu of the Thin Plate Department of Taiyuan Iron and Steel Works has recently been put into production. The commissioning of this equipment will enable the Thin Plate Department to produce an additional 420 tons of thin plates within a year.

The Thin Plate Department uses one motor to drive two rolling mills for production. In the past, one rolling mill often had problems requiring roll changes, and the other rolling mill had to stop production as well. The "Non-Stop Up and Down Sleeve Connection" equipment can ensure that when one rolling mill stops, the other rolling mill continues to operate. Approximately 179 hours of rolling time can be added within a year.

    新添一台设备增产四百二十吨薄板
    新华社太原12日电　太原钢铁厂薄板部技术员周震亚和老工人阮成普合作制成的“不停车上下接套”设备，最近投入生产。这套设备投入生产，可使薄板部在一年内多生产四百二十吨薄板。
    薄板部是用一个马达带动两部轧机进行生产的。过去，常常因为一部轧机发生毛病需要换辊，另一部轧机也不得不停止生产。“不停车上下接套”设备，可以保证一部轧机停车时，另一部轧机继续开动。一年内，大约可以增加179小时的轧制时间。
