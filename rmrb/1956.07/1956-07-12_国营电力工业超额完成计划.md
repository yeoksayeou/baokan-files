    State-Owned Electricity Industry Exceeds Planned Targets

    (Our report) The state-owned electricity industry has exceeded its production plan for the first half of this year. In the first half of the year, state-owned power plants across the country generated more than 220 million kilowatt-hours of electricity than planned. This amount of electricity can supply coal mines to excavate 18 million tons of coal.

    In the first half of this year, local electricity bureaus and power plants strengthened the analysis of technical and economic indicators, and universally launched a coal-saving and electricity-saving campaign. In the past six months, the electricity loss in the lines of electricity bureaus across the country has been reduced by 15 million kilowatt-hours than planned. The electricity consumption of internal machines in power plants across the country has been reduced by 26 million kilowatt-hours. Due to the reduction of coal consumption rate indicators, thermal power plants across the country saved the country 47,800 tons of standard coal.

    In the first half of this year, the labor productivity plan of the state-owned electricity industry was completed by 104.4%, and the plan for delivering profits to the state has also been overfulfilled.

    国营电力工业超额完成计划
    本报讯　国营电力工业超额完成今年上半年的生产计划。全国国营发电厂上半年比计划多发了二亿二千多万度电，用这些电力可以供给煤矿挖掘1，800万吨煤炭。
    今年上半年各地电业局和发电厂加强了技术经济指标的分析工作，普遍开展了省煤节电竞赛。半年来，全国各电业局的线路损失电量比计划节省了1，500万度，全国发电厂厂内机器用电节省了2，600万度，全国火力发电厂由于煤耗率指标的降低，给国家节省了47，800吨标准煤。
    今年上半年国营电力工业的劳动生产率计划完成了104.4％，上缴利润计划也已超额完成。
