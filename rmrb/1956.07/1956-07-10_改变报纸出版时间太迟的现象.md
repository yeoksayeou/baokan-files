    Changing the Phenomenon of Overly Late Newspaper Publication Times
    In recent days, the editorial department of this newspaper has frequently received phone calls from readers criticizing the overly late publication time of the newspaper. Zhu Yuanzhu, a reader from Tianjin, wrote: "The People's Daily is always published late, often making readers anxiously and angrily wait. The editorial department should bear the main responsibility for this."
    The readers' criticism is correct. The fact that the newspaper cannot be published and delivered to readers on time is indeed something for which the "editorial department should bear the main responsibility," especially since the newspaper has been expanded to eight pages. Due to insufficient preparation by some in the editorial department and certain difficulties in the work, the newspaper publication time has been delayed. The editorial department of this newspaper accepts the readers' criticism and is now working hard to change this phenomenon and strive for the timely publication of the newspaper. (Editor)

    改变报纸出版时间太迟的现象
    近几天来，本报编辑部经常接到读者来电话，批评报纸出版时间太迟。天津市的读者朱元铸来信说：“人民日报老是不按时出版，常常使读者等得心焦恼火，编辑部对此应负主要责任。”
    读者的批评是正确的。报纸不能按时出版，并送到读者手里，确实应该由“编辑部负主要责任”，特别是从本报改出八版以后，由于编辑部某些准备工作做得不够，工作
  中存在某些困难，以致延迟了报纸出版的时间。本报编辑部接受读者的批评，现在正在努力改变这种现象，争取报纸按时出版。（编者）
