    The Ministry of Railways' Construction Engineering Company
    Unclear Tasks, Overly Large Organization

    The Ministry of Railways' Construction Engineering Company has unclear tasks, a large organization, and very chaotic work. This phenomenon was criticized in the "Reader's Letter Page" of the People's Daily on September 11, 1955, and the Ministry of Railways also sent a working group to investigate. However, more than nine months have passed, and the problem remains unresolved.

    Since its establishment in 1953, the Construction Engineering Company has actively been "recruiting soldiers and buying horses, accumulating grass and storing grain," spreading its operations very widely, but with little actual work to do. It has had to contract civil construction or projects from other units everywhere. The construction and installation tasks completed by the four engineering divisions under the company's leadership in 1954 and 1955 were not even comparable to the amount of work completed by a single work zone of the Beijing Construction Company in two years. As a result, the phenomenon of wasted work is very serious.

    According to an inspection by the company's People's Supervision Office in December of last year, the actual number of employees in the company exceeded the prescribed number by 60%; in reality, the originally prescribed number of employees was also far beyond the needs of the work. The proportion of non-production personnel in the company is very large. According to statistics from 1955, the number of administrative management personnel was 26% of the number of production workers; the company completed tasks worth 25.5 million yuan for the whole year, but administrative management expenses amounted to 2.7 million yuan, accounting for more than 10% of the production value.

    The company's backlog of materials is also very serious. The entire company has 558 machines, most of which are stored in warehouses; even the 150 machines that are used most frequently have a utilization rate of only about 49%.

    These situations have been reported to the leaders of the Ministry of Railways more than once by many comrades over the years. Some have suggested that the Ministry of Railways does not have many construction tasks, so there is no need to establish a Construction Engineering Company; others have suggested that if construction engineering needs to develop in a specialized direction, a management organization that meets the actual needs should be established based on the existing tasks. In short, everyone believes that the phenomenon of the Ministry of Railways establishing a construction organization to contract projects everywhere is abnormal. However, the leadership of the Ministry of Railways has not been determined to solve this problem.

    The current problems existing in the Construction Engineering Company are very serious and must be resolved immediately and can no longer be delayed. (Meng Yan)

### 铁道部建厂工程公司  任务不明确，机构太庞大

    铁道部建厂工程公司
    任务不明确，机构太庞大
    铁道部建厂工程公司的任务不明确，机构庞大，工作十分混乱。1955年9月11日人民日报“读者来信专页”对这种现象曾经提出批评，铁道部也曾经派工作组进行了检查，但是时间过了九个多月，问题仍然没有解决。
    建厂工程公司从1953年成立以后，就积极地“招兵买马，积草屯粮”，摊子铺得很大，但是没有多少事情做，只好到处承包民用建筑或其他单位的工程。公司领导下的四个工程处在1954年和1955年两年中完成的建筑安装任务，还抵不上北京市建筑公司一个工区在两年中完成的工作量。因此，窝工现象十分严重。
    根据公司人民监察室在去年十二月的检查，当时公司的实有人数超过规定人数的60％；而实际上，原来规定的编制人数也是大大超过工作需要的。公司里的非生产人员比重很大，据1955年的统计，行政管理人员人数为生产工人人数的26％；公司全年完成任务2，550万元，行政管理费却开支了270万元，合生产价值的10％以上。
    这个公司积压器材的情况也很严重。全公司共有机械558台，大部分都放在仓库里；使用最多的150台机械，利用率也只有49％左右。
    这些情况，几年来有许多同志不止一次地向铁道部领导同志反映过。有人提出铁道部的建厂任务不多，没有必要设立建厂工程公司；有人提出如果建厂工程需要向专业化方向发展，应该按现有的任务设立一个切合实际需要的管理机构；总之，大家认为铁道部设立一个建筑机构来到处承包工程的现象是不正常的。但是铁道部领导方面一直没有下决心解决这个问题。
    建厂工程公司目前存在的问题是很严重的，必须立刻解决，不能再拖下去了。　　（孟炎）
