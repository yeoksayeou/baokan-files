    A year ago today, the heads of government of the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France held their first meeting in Geneva in ten years since the end of the war. This meeting was of great historical significance, opening up good prospects for improving relations between countries, especially major powers, and safeguarding lasting world peace, becoming a turning point in the post-war international situation. Over the past year, the "Geneva Spirit" has increasingly taken root in people's hearts. The struggle of people of all countries to safeguard peace and strive for international cooperation has achieved great results, and the international situation has definitely trended towards relaxation.
    The "Geneva Spirit", like the "Bandung Spirit" that has been praised by the world, embodies the vibrant spirit of the present age of mankind. This is the spirit of peaceful coexistence and international cooperation. Now, not only the peace-loving people of all countries, but also far-sighted politicians in Western countries, have confirmed that the era of resorting to force and war is over, and the world has entered a new period of peaceful coexistence. This new period requires the settlement of all international disputes through consultation and the extensive development of international cooperation on the basis of respecting the independence and sovereignty of all countries.
    The principle of peaceful coexistence has been universally accepted as a guiding principle in international relations. On the basis of this principle, a vast area of peace, including socialist and non-socialist countries, has now been formed and is expanding, which provides a practical prerequisite for establishing lasting and consolidated peace.
    Establishing friendly contact between leaders of various countries, especially heads of major powers, is playing an important role in promoting the favorable development of the situation. The recent talks between the Soviet Union and Britain, and the Soviet Union and France, are important facts that have laid the foundation for adjusting and improving relations between major powers. Leaders of Western powers such as Britain and France are now openly stating their willingness to play the role of "bridge" in communicating between East and West. The recent Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference also reiterated this attitude, which is conducive to the cause of peace and international cooperation. This has made the international Cold War forces unprecedentedly isolated. This is an important development in the current situation.
    Under the influence of the "Geneva Spirit" and the "Bandung Spirit", the idea of peaceful neutrality has rapidly developed in many countries. In some countries that participate in Western military blocs or are selected by the United States as Cold War bases, the development of this idea is particularly noteworthy. This development has an increasingly significant impact on the international situation. As many prominent politicians have explained, peaceful neutrality is not passive, but active. It means resolutely safeguarding peace, promoting international friendship, and safeguarding the independent development of all countries. Therefore, it has gained great trust and support from all honest, kind, and peace-loving people.
    Due to the development of the ideas of coexistence and neutrality, the evils caused by the notorious "Cold War" policy of the past few years have gradually been eliminated. The aggressive military blocs pieced together by the United States and other Western countries have encountered an unprecedented crisis. The friendly relations between all countries that refuse to participate in military blocs are increasingly consolidated, and even countries that have participated in military blocs are increasingly demanding to improve and enhance relations with other countries. The estrangement and differences that originally existed between many countries have narrowed, and understanding and trust have begun to be established. Economic and cultural exchanges between countries have greatly developed, promoting friendly cooperation between countries. Now, the myth of the so-called "communist aggression threat" that was taken out of the Cold War arsenal has been completely bankrupt. The embargo and trade restriction policies imposed on various countries, which damaged the interests of these countries, have begun to disintegrate, and international cooperation based on equality, mutual benefit, mutual respect for national sovereignty, and non-interference in internal affairs is expanding.
    The strengthening of international trust and cooperation, and the improvement of relations between major powers, have certainly created favorable conditions for solving pressing international problems.
    However, the road to peaceful coexistence and negotiated settlement of major international issues is not smooth and without obstacles. Currently, the United States is the only major power that has not adopted a positive attitude towards peaceful coexistence. Although the results of the US policy of pursuing the Cold War and creating division, suspicion, and discord have made its prestige unprecedentedly low and increasingly isolated, some groups in the United States still refuse to abandon this bankrupt and rigid policy. They try to attribute the relaxation of the situation to their "policy of strength." They still try to make people believe that there is a so-called "communist threat", so it is necessary to continue to maintain hostile military blocs and huge armaments. They set up many obstacles on the road to solving various pressing international problems in order to maintain the tense situation that is as precious as life to them. They have recently even viciously attacked neutrality, attempting to deepen the division of the world. However, as a Chinese saying goes, lifting a stone to drop it on one's own feet, these practices of the United States have only aroused greater dissatisfaction among the people of all countries and all people with a sense of reality and independent thinking, further reducing the prestige of the United States in the international arena. People who once tried to bury the "Geneva Spirit" but failed are now forced to increasingly recognize that the situation is trending towards relaxation, and that war violates the spirit of the times. They now have to take more covert and roundabout methods to carry out "Cold War" activities.
    The American people do not want war. They are increasingly powerfully grasping the issue of war and peace in their own hands. At present, even many people in the US ruling groups and business circles have seen that the "policy of strength" will not work and advocate changing foreign policy. People welcome this realistic assessment of the situation and believe that improving US relations with various countries, thereby promoting East-West cooperation, has a broad realistic basis. Recently, people have sometimes seen some conciliatory gestures from the US government, but on all current major issues, people have not yet seen any determination from Washington to change course. On the contrary, people have heard US foreign policy makers repeatedly emphasize the role of the "policy of strength" and adopt a rigid and even hostile attitude towards peace and international cooperation on many major international issues. The people of all countries demand that the US government, for the sake of peace and the interests of the American people, follow the conciliatory approach taken by its leaders at the Geneva Four-Power Summit Conference and implement it in concrete actions.
    The Chinese government and people have always made unremitting efforts to consolidate peace, establish and expand international cooperation, and seek negotiated settlements of international disputes. The Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence advocated by China, India, and Myanmar have made significant contributions to the cause of international peace and cooperation. These principles are the basic conditions for peaceful coexistence. If all countries, especially major powers, act in accordance with these principles, respect the right of other peoples to choose their own social and political systems and to handle their own affairs, and do not engage in or attempt to engage in interference and aggression; then, peaceful coexistence will replace the harmful "Cold War" on a worldwide scale, and the people of all countries will be able to enjoy lasting peace with peace of mind. Now, even many who were originally skeptical understand that in our time, broad international cooperation is a completely achievable goal. Although there will be many obstacles and difficulties ahead that need to be overcome through effort, as long as peace-loving countries and people persist and continue to carry forward the "Geneva Spirit", these difficulties and obstacles can be completely overcome, and lasting peace and broad international cooperation can be fully realized.

### 继续发扬“日内瓦精神”

    继续发扬“日内瓦精神”
    一年前的今天，苏、美、英、法四国政府首脑在日内瓦举行了战后十年来第一次会议。这次会议具有十分重要的历史意义，它打开了改善各国特别是大国之间的关系和保障世界持久和平的良好前景，成为战后国际局势的转折点。一年来，“日内瓦精神”日益深入人心，各国人民维护和平、争取国际合作的斗争，已经取得巨大的成果，国际局势已经肯定地趋向和缓。
    “日内瓦精神”，它同已经得到举世称颂的“万隆精神”一样，体现着人类当前生气勃勃的时代精神。这就是和平共处和国际合作的精神。现在，不仅是各国爱好和平的人民，而且西方国家中有远见的政治家，都已确认：诉诸武力和战争的时代已经过去了，世界已经进入和平共处的新时期。这个新时期，要求以协商方式解决一切国际争端，要求在尊重各国的独立和主权的基础上广泛发展国际合作。
    和平共处原则已经普遍地被接受为国际关系中的指导准则。在这个原则的基础上，包括社会主义国家和非社会主义国家的广大的和平地区，现在已经形成并正在扩大，这为建立持久和巩固的和平提供了实际的前提。
    各国领导人特别是大国首脑之间建立友好接触，对于促成局势的有利发展，正在起着重要的作用。最近苏英、苏法的会谈，是奠定了调整和改善大国关系的基础的重要事实。西方的大国如英国和法国的领导人，现在公开表明他们愿意为沟通东西方关系起“桥梁”的作用。最近英联邦总理会议也重申了这种有助于和平和国际合作事业的态度。这就使得国际冷战势力空前地孤立起来。这是当前局势中的一个重要的发展。
    在“日内瓦精神”和“万隆精神”的影响下，和平中立的思想，已经在许多国家里迅速地发展起来。在一些参加西方军事集团或被美国选择为冷战基地的国家里，这种思想的发展特别引人注意。这种发展对国际局势发生日益显著的影响。正像许多卓越的政治家所解释的，和平中立不是消极的，而是积极的。它意味着坚决维护和平，促进国际友谊，保障各国的独立发展。因此，它得到了所有正直的、善良的、爱好和平的人民极大的信任和支持。
    由于共处和中立的思想的发展，几年来臭名远扬的“冷战”政策所造成的恶果，已有可能逐渐得到消除。美国和其他西方国家拼凑的侵略性军事集团，遭到了空前的危机。所有拒绝参加军事集团的国家之间的友好关系正日益巩固，即使参加了军事集团的国家，也越来越多地要求改善和增进同其他国家的关系。原来在许多国家间存在着的隔阂和分歧缩小了，谅解和信任开始建立起来。各国经济和文化的交流有了很大的发展，促进了国与国间的友好合作。现在，从冷战武器库中搬出来的所谓“共产主义侵略威胁”之类的神话已经彻底破产，强加在各国身上、损害这些国家利益的禁运和贸易限制政策开始瓦解，建立在平等互利、互相尊重国家主权、互不干涉内政的基础上的国际合作日益扩大。
    国际信任和合作的加强，大国关系的改善，这肯定地已为解决迫切的国际问题创造了良好的条件。
    但是，在和平共处和协商解决重大国际问题的道路上，并不是平坦和毫无阻碍的。目前大国中还剩下美国一国在和平共处方面仍然没有采取积极的态度，尽管美国奉行冷战，制造分裂、猜疑和不和的政策的结果，已经使它的威信空前低落，愈来愈陷于孤立的境地，但是美国的某些集团到现在还是不肯放弃这个破了产的僵硬政策。他们力图把局势的和缓归因于他们的“实力政策”。他们仍努力想要使人们相信存在所谓“共产主义的威胁”，因此必须继续保持敌对的军事集团和庞大的军备。他们在解决各种迫切的国际问题的道路上设置许多障碍，以便维持对他们说来像生命一样宝贵的紧张局势。他们最近甚至恶毒地攻击中立，企图加深世界的分裂。但是，中国有句俗语说得好，搬起石头打自己的脚，美国这些作法只是引起了各国人民以及一切具有现实感和独立思想的人们的更大不满，使得美国在国际上的威信进一步降低。曾经企图埋葬“日内瓦精神”而没有成功的人们，现在被迫愈来愈多地承认局势趋向和缓，承认战争违背时代的精神，他们现在不得不采取更加隐蔽和迂回的办法来进行“冷战”的活动了。
    美国人民是不要战争的。他们正愈来愈有力地把战争与和平这个问题掌握在自己手里。目前，连美国统治集团和企业界中也已有不少人看到“实力政策”走不通，主张改变外交政策。人们欢迎这种对局势的现实估计，并认为改善美国同各国的关系，从而促进东西方的合作，是有广泛的现实基础的。最近，人们有时也看到美国政府某些和缓的姿态，但是，在所有当前的重大问题上人们还不能看到华盛顿有表现出任何改弦更张的决心，相反，人们却听到美国外交政策制定人们一再强调“实力政策”的作用，并在许多重大国际问题上采取僵硬以至仇视和平和国际合作的态度。各国人民要求美国政府为了和平和美国民族的利益，遵循它的领导人在日内瓦四国首脑会议上采取的和解的方针，并把它贯彻到具体的行动中去。
    中国政府和人民始终不懈地为巩固和平，建立和扩大国际合作，谋求协商解决国际争端而努力。中印、中缅所倡导的和平共处五项原则，已经对国际和平合作事业作出了重大的贡献。这些原则就是和平共处的基本条件。如果所有国家，特别是大国，都按这些原则办事，尊重别国人民选择自己社会和政治制度以及处理本国事务的权利，不进行或试图进行干涉和侵略；那么，和平共处就将在全世界的范围内代替有害的“冷战”，各国人民就将能够安心地享受持久的和平。现在，连许多原来抱有怀疑的人也明白了：在我们的时代里，广泛的国际合作是一个完全可以实现的目标。尽管横在前面的阻碍和困难还会很多，有待于努力克服，但是，只要爱好和平的国家和人民坚持不懈、继续发扬“日内瓦精神”，这些困难和阻碍是完全可以克服的，持久的和平和广泛的国际合作是完全可以实现的。
