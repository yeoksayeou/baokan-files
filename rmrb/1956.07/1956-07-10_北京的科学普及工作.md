    北京的科学普及工作
    据新华社讯　北京市科学技术普及协会负责人在六日举行的会员大会上说：五年来，这个协会组织了近五千次科学技术知识讲演，听讲的共达一百七十多万人次。
    向工人普及生产技术知识是这个协会近两年来组织讲演的重点。有九万六千多个各种工种的工人分别听了高速切削法、机械工人速成看图法、汽车专业、钳工等方面的讲演。最近，这个协会还订出了关于原子能、半导体和无线电技术等很多方面的科学技术新成就的介绍计划。两千多个干部听了北京大学物理系教授褚圣麟、清华大学教授徐亦庄等人讲的原子能及其应用的介绍，都感到很大兴趣。
    在北京的高等学校、科学研究机关和工厂里，很多教授、研究员和工程师都挤出业余时间，担负科学普及工作。
