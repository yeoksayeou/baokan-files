    Editorials Should Be Timely
    The problems raised in the People's Daily's editorial on June 25th, "Tea Harvesting and Purchasing," are all correct, but the editorial was published too late. The editorial stated: "Currently, the spring tea purchasing work has not yet concluded, and the summer tea and autumn tea purchasing are about to begin…," "In order to make the summer tea and autumn tea grow well and sprout more, tea farmers should be mobilized to carry out a thorough cultivation and fertilization after the spring tea harvest." In reality, by June 25th, the summer tea season was almost over, and the quantity of autumn tea is very small. Therefore, if this editorial had been published earlier, at the end of May, its impact would have been much greater.

    社论要及时
    人民日报六月二十五日社论“茶叶的采制和收购”所提出的问题都是正确的，但是，社论刊出的时间太迟了。社论说：“现在，春茶的收购工作还没有完结，夏茶和秋茶的收购又要开始……”，“为了使夏茶和秋茶长得好，发芽多，要动员茶农在春茶采摘以后，全面地进行一次中耕施肥”。实际上，至六月二十五日，夏茶即将结束了，而秋茶的数量又很少。因此，如果这篇社论提早在五月底刊出，它的作用就更大了。
