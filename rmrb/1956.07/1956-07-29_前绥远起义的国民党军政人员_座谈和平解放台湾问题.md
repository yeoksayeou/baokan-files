Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, July 28th: Sun Lanfeng, Vice Chairman of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and member of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, stated at a symposium on the peaceful liberation of Taiwan held by the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference on the 26th: "The fact that the Communist Party and the People's Government have consistently treated the uprising personnel with generosity in the nearly seven years since the peaceful liberation of the former Suiyuan Province powerfully tells the Kuomintang military and political personnel in Taiwan that they no longer need to have any doubts or concerns about their future."

Sun Lanfeng was the former commander of the Kuomintang Ninth Army Corps and Chairman of Chahar Province. He participated in the peaceful liberation uprising of the former Suiyuan Province. He said, "I am now the Vice Chairman of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, with position and power, and I am responsible for leading seven departments and bureaus of the autonomous region, including forestry and health. I have to handle many specific work problems every day. The country's socialist construction is progressing rapidly, and my work is intense and joyful." He also earnestly hoped that the military and political personnel in Taiwan, for the sake of the country, the nation, and their own vital interests, would quickly embrace the motherland.

An Chunshan, the former commander of the Kuomintang Provisional Third Army and current Deputy Director of the Forestry Department of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, said, "Beijing and Suiyuan were able to be peacefully liberated, and Taiwan certainly can be too. The military and political personnel in Taiwan should make a decision sooner rather than later." Zhang Zhuoqing (Hui nationality), the former Deputy Commander of the Kuomintang Suiyuan Province Security Force and current member of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region People's Committee and Deputy Mayor of Hohhot, said, "The military and political personnel in Taiwan only have one way out: to quickly get rid of American control and stop living a life dependent on others."

More than ten people, including Li Juyi, the former Director of the Finance Department of Suiyuan Province and current Deputy Director of the Counselor's Office of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region People's Committee, spoke at the symposium. They all unanimously supported Premier Zhou Enlai's speech on the peaceful liberation of Taiwan at the Third Session of the First National People's Congress.
