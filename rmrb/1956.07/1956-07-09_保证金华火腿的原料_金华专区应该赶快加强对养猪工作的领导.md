    Raising a Large Number of Pigs Increases Income from Sideline Occupations
    Editor's Note: The State Council's "Directive on Developing Pig Raising," issued on July 1, points out that raising a large number of pigs is a decisive measure for agricultural producers' cooperatives to develop production and ensure increased income for their members. Currently, some regions have relaxed their leadership over pig raising. Jinhua District is a specific example. Jinhua District and other regions with similar situations should quickly attach importance to the work of developing pig raising.
    
    Guarantee Raw Materials for Jinhua Ham
    Jinhua Special District Should Quickly Strengthen Leadership Over Pig Raising
    Xu SanSi, Wang ZhuangDuan
    Farmers in Jinhua Special District, Zhejiang Province, have long regarded raising pigs as their main sideline occupation. The annual income from raising pigs is equivalent to one-third of the rice production. The Jinhua ham here is famous throughout the country. This year, the special district's pig production is planned to increase by 86.5% compared to last year. However, according to a survey in May, the entire district raised a total of 690,431 pigs, a decrease of 3.11% compared to last year. Currently, 20% of the pigsties of the pre-purchase households in the district are still empty. Since June, the number of pigs in some areas has increased slightly, but the development speed is still very slow.

    Why is pig development so slow? The main reason is that some county, district, township, and cooperative cadres do not have a sufficient understanding of the policy of combining agricultural and sideline production, and have relaxed their leadership over pig production. Some leading cadres of cooperatives fear that if members raise too many pigs themselves, it will affect agricultural production within the cooperative, so they take various measures to restrict members from raising pigs. For example, the township head of Lingdi Township in Jiangshan County does not manage pig work himself and also prevents pig pre-purchase staff from carrying out their work. The Shengli Cooperative in Wantian Township, Qu County, does not provide feed for pigs raised privately by members. This has greatly frustrated the enthusiasm of farmers to raise pigs. This cooperative originally had 74 households raising 92 pigs, but now there are only 43 left.

    Expanding the production and supply of feed is one of the important conditions for developing pig production, but many places have not done this work well. After cooperativization, land was used uniformly, and in order to produce more grain, cooperatives no longer reserved land for planting green fodder, and even ponds that originally grew green fodder were converted to growing lotus roots. Zhou Luxing, a member of the Changkeng Agricultural Cooperative in Xinchuan Township, Jinyun County, planted 300 pumpkin plants (mainly for pig feed) before joining the cooperative. This year, a production team of 20 households in the cooperative only planted 160 pumpkin plants. The number of pigs raised by this cooperative has decreased significantly compared to before. The Zhongzhou Agricultural Cooperative in Lanxi County raised 25 pigs. Because there was no feed, they had to sell "Ke Lang pigs" to exchange for some feed. Now there are only 12 pigs left in the cooperative. Piglets need to eat refined feed, but people pay little attention to the refined feed needed by piglets. A sow gives birth to two litters of piglets a year, generally producing 20 piglets. Each piglet needs to eat 15 jin of refined feed from the start of feeding to the time of sale, for a total of 300 jin for 20 piglets. However, when the grain "three fix" work was carried out last year, except for Dongyang and Songyang counties, which reserved 300 jin of refined feed per sow, most counties only reserved more than 100 jin of refined feed per sow, which was not enough at all. The lack of refined feed directly affects the development of piglets. One sow in Cheng Peihong's family in Yaban Township, Jinhua County, gave birth to 17 piglets. Because of the lack of feed and milk, 7 died. The remaining 10 were raised for more than 50 days, and each weighed only three or four jin.

    The failure of feed processing and supply departments to take responsibility has also aggravated the difficulty of feed supply. For example, the bran processed by the processing department is of poor quality and small quantity, and the promotion of substitute feeds such as corn cobs and sorghum husks has not been actively promoted. The procedures for purchasing feed are also too cumbersome. Generally, it is necessary to go through investigation and queuing, mass evaluation, registration and application, party branch review, district committee approval, and verification by the county pig production and sales committee before obtaining a feed certificate from the district grain management office and purchasing feed with the certificate. This year, the province allocated more than 11.12 million jin of refined feed to Jinhua Special District in February, but only 33.05% was supplied to farmers by mid-May. The 150,000 jin of refined feed allocated to Xuanping County by the special district was only supplied 5,000 jin by mid-May.

    There is a saying among farmers: "If raising pigs doesn't make money, look back at the fields." Farmers raise pigs not only to accumulate sporadic funds but also to accumulate fertilizer. However, at present, the price of pig manure of many agricultural production cooperative members is too low. An agricultural production cooperative in Chengnan Township, Jinyun County, stipulates that the pig manure of members should be converted into investment in the cooperative, but each dan is only converted into 1 jiao 1 fen. Farmers in Qu County are accustomed to using rice straw to pad pigsties. It costs one yuan to buy one dan of rice straw, and one dan of rice straw can produce four dan of manure after being used as bedding. The cooperative prices each dan of manure at 2 jiao, and four dan of manure is only worth 8 jiao. Pig manure is not counted, and the rice straw alone costs 2 jiao. Farmers reflect: Raising pigs to sell fertilizer is not as cost-effective as working in the fields to earn work points.

    Failure to actively prevent the spread of pig diseases also prevents pigs from developing rapidly. The plum rain season is the time when pig infectious diseases spread. In previous years, pigs were prone to death from swine erysipelas and swine fever during this season. This year, pig disease prevention work is worse than in the past. For example, in 1954, more than 400,000 pigs were vaccinated, but this year, due to a lack of medicines, only 24,280 pigs have been vaccinated, accounting for 3.47% of the actual number of pigs. Because the prevention work has not been done well, pig infectious diseases are currently occurring in Jinhua, Lanxi, Xuanping, Yongkang, and other counties. In Jinhua County alone, 250 pigs died in April. In the farm in Pujiang County, 31 of the 35 piglets died of white dysentery.

    Since the wheat harvest, the enthusiasm of farmers for raising pigs has increased, but because the relevant departments do not pay attention to the management of the piglet market, pig dealers take the opportunity to operate, and piglet prices have soared. The price of piglets in Dongyang County has risen from 7 jiao 2 fen per jin to 9 jiao. The highest price of piglets in Longyou County is 2 yuan 1 jiao per jin, exceeding the normal price by 1-3 times. The cost of one piglet is equivalent to 200 jin of wheat. In addition, the price of pig feed is also unreasonable. For example, the price of carrots used as pig feed was 8 jiao per dan in 1953, but rose to 1 yuan 5 jiao after 1954, while the purchase price of fat pigs has not changed. Farmers reflect: "The coffin is expensive, and raising pigs is not profitable."

    Jinhua Special District is a key area for pig production. If these problems are not effectively resolved, the district's export plan for pigs and the production plan for salt-cured Jinhua ham will not be completed this year. It is hoped that the party and government leading organs and business departments at all levels in the Jinhua area will quickly take effective measures to eliminate various obstacles to the development of pig production.

    大量养猪增加农副业收入
    编者按：国务院在七月一日发布的“关于发展养猪的指示”中指出，大量养猪是农业生产合作社发展生产、保证社员增加收入的一项具有决定意义的措施。目前有些地区放松了对养猪工作的领导。金华地区就是一个具体例子。金华地区和别的一些有类似情况的地区，都应该赶快把发展养猪的工作重视起来。
    保证金华火腿的原料
    金华专区应该赶快加强对养猪工作的领导
    徐三思　王庄端
    浙江省金华专区的农民，很久以来就把饲养生猪作为自己的主要副业，每年养猪的收入，相当稻谷产量的三分之一。这里的金华火腿驰名全国。今年全专区的生猪生产，按计划要比去年增加86.5％。但从五月份的调查看来，全区共养生猪690，431只，比去年还减少3.11％。目前，全区生猪预购户中，有20％的猪栏还是空的。六月份起，部分地区生猪数量略有增加，但发展速度仍然很慢。
    为什么生猪发展这样缓慢？主要是因为部分县、区、乡、社干部，对农副业生产相结合的方针认识不够，放松了对生猪生产的领导。有些合作社的领导干部怕社员自己养猪多了，影响社内农业生产，就采取种种办法限制社员养猪。如江山县岭底乡乡长自己不管生猪工作，还阻止生猪预购办事员进行工作。衢县万田乡胜利社对社员私养的猪不给饲料。这样，就大大挫折了农民养猪的积极性。这个社原有74户养猪92只，现在只剩了43只。
    扩大饲料的生产和供应，是发展生猪生产的重要条件之一，但是许多地方没有做好这个工作。合作化以后，土地统一使用了，合作社为了多生产粮食，不再留种青饲料的土地，连原有的种青饲料的池塘也改种藕了。缙云县新川乡长坑农业社社员周芦幸，入社前种了300棵南瓜（主要作猪饲料），今年这个社的一个20户的生产队才只种了160棵南瓜。这个社养猪数比较以前显著减少。兰溪县中洲农业社养猪25只，因为没有饲料，只得出卖“克郎猪”换回一点饲料来，现在全社只剩下12只猪了。仔猪是需要吃精饲料的，但是人们对仔猪所需要的精饲料很少注意。一只母猪一年生两窝仔猪，一般可生20只，一只仔猪从开食到出卖需吃15斤精料，20只共食精料300斤，但去年进行粮食“三定”工作的时候，除了东阳、松阳二县每只母猪留精饲料300斤外，大部县份一只母猪只留精料100多斤，这根本不够吃。精料缺乏，直接影响仔猪的发展。金华县雅畈乡程培洪家的一只母猪生下17只仔猪，因为缺料无奶，死了7只，其余10只养了五十多天，每只还只有三、四斤重。
    饲料加工和供应部门没有负起责任，也加重了饲料供应的困难。比如加工部门加工的统糠质粗量少，对玉米芯、高粱壳等代饲料也没有积极推广。购买饲料的手续也太麻烦，一般要经过调查排队、群众评议、造册申请、党支部审查、区委批准、县生猪产销委员会核准，才能到区粮食管理所领取饲料证，凭证购买。今年二月省拨给金华专区1，112万多斤精饲料，到五月中旬只供应给农民33.05％，专区分配到宣平县的15万斤精饲料，到五月中旬只供应了5千斤。
    农民有句俗话说：“养猪不赚钱，回头看看田。”农民养猪，除开为了零星储积资金外，就是为了积攒肥料。但是，目前不少农业生产合作社社员的猪肥作价偏低。缙云县城南乡一个农业生产合作社规定社员的猪肥要折价向社投资，但每担只折价一角一分。衢县农民习惯用稻草垫猪栏，买一担稻草要一元，一担稻草垫栏后可起四担栏粪，合作社给每担粪折价二角，四担栏粪只值八角，猪粪不算数，光稻草就要赔二角。农民反映：养猪卖肥料，不如下田干活挣工分上算。
    没有积极防止猪病的流行，也使生猪不能迅速发展。梅雨季节正是生猪传染病蔓延的时候。往年这个季节，猪容易死于猪丹毒、猪肺疫。今年猪病预防工作比过去更差。如1954年受预防注射的猪40多万只，今年因药品缺乏，目前只有24，280只，受了预防注射。占实有生猪数的3.47％。由于预防工作没有做好，目前金华、兰溪、宣平、永康等县，猪传染病正在发生。只金华县四月份一个月，就死亡生猪250只，浦江县农场有35只仔猪，死于白痢病的就有31只。
    麦收以来，农民的养猪积极性虽有提高，但因有关部门对小猪市场的管理不重视，致使猪贩乘机活动，小猪价格猛涨。东阳县的小猪由一斤七角二分涨到九角，龙游县的小猪最高卖到二元一斤，超过正常价格1—3倍，一只小猪成本合200斤麦子。此外，猪饲料价格也不尽合理。如作猪饲料用的胡萝卜1953年每担八角，1954年后涨到一元五角，而肥猪收购价格却没有变。农民反映：“板贵棺材贱，养猪没有利。”
    金华专区是生猪生产的重点区，如果上面的这些问题得不到有效解决，今年全区的生猪出口计划和盐制金华火腿的生产计划就无法完成。希望金华地区的各级党政领导机关和业务部门赶快采取有效措施，消除发展生猪生产的各种障碍。
