Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, July 1st: In the past two days, the water level of the Yangtze River's upper and middle reaches has risen rapidly. At 2:00 PM on June 30th, the water level at Shashi had already exceeded the warning level, and the river surface at Hankou Wuhan Customs had risen more than 7 decimeters compared to three days prior. Many hydrological stations in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River have recorded their highest water levels since the beginning of this flood season.

Since late June, most areas in the Yangtze River basin have experienced continuous rainfall. Provinces such as Sichuan, Hubei, Anhui, and Jiangsu have also experienced continuous heavy rain, with rainfall mostly exceeding 100 millimeters, causing floods in the main stream of the Yangtze River and many tributaries. After heavy rain in the Jialing River basin in Sichuan, the flood peak water level at the Beibei hydrological station on the Jialing River exceeded the highest recorded water level by more than one meter. The floodwaters flowing from the Jialing River and the upper reaches of the Yangtze River converged in the Three Gorges area with the runoff from heavy rains entering the river above and below the Three Gorges, causing the water level to rise even faster. When the floodwaters reached Yichang, the Yichang water level rose more than seven meters compared to five days prior. At the same time, due to the impact of heavy rains in nearby areas, the Yangtze River's middle and lower reaches have generally risen by three to six decimeters or more in the past two days from Chenglingji downstream. In addition, the Han River recently experienced a flood peak. According to experienced hydrological workers, due to the discharge of floodwaters from the upper reaches, the water level at Hankou Wuhan Customs will continue to rise in early July.

Currently, flood prevention activities are being intensified on the Jingjiang Dike. Flood prevention materials from various places along the river are also being rapidly mobilized. In addition, the flood prevention and diversion preparations for the Jingjiang flood diversion area's inlet sluice have been completed. The management personnel of the newly built Dujiatai flood diversion project in the lower reaches of the Han River are also stepping up the installation of lighting equipment on the flood diversion sluice gates, training laborers to open and close the gates, and actively carrying out preparations before flood diversion.

Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou: After surviving the second flood, it is necessary to conduct a comprehensive inspection and preparation of flood prevention work in order to meet potentially larger floods – this is the requirement put forward by the Yellow River Flood Prevention Headquarters in its instructions issued today to flood prevention headquarters at all levels along the Yellow River.

The Yellow River has broken the convention of not entering the flood season until July, entering the flood season about a month earlier in June. The Yellow River has already experienced two floods this June. Not only did these two floods arrive early, but the flood peak of the second flood also exceeded the warning water level at Qinchang, Gaocun, Sunkou, Aishan, Luokou, and other places. Because the silted-up riverbed has not yet been scoured away, the flow rate of the second flood peak this year was not as high as the maximum flow rate in 1954, but the water level at Gaocun exceeded the highest water level in 1954 by two centimeters. If there is more heavy rain in the middle reaches of the Yellow River recently, the third flood may very well arrive. Therefore, the Yellow River Flood Prevention Headquarters has requested the Yellow River flood prevention headquarters at all levels to seize the gap between the second and third floods to conduct a comprehensive inspection and summary of the characteristics of the floods and the changes in the river situation and engineering conditions, and to make comprehensive preparations ideologically, organizationally, and in terms of materials and supplies, and to be on strict guard against the arrival of the third flood.

The Yellow River Flood Prevention Headquarters itself is also actively carrying out preparatory work. On the afternoon of June 30th, a rescue team consisting of more than sixty cadres, engineers, and workers was formed; the rescue team has ten vehicles, four generators, and searchlights and other equipment, so that it can immediately rush to the rescue if there is danger to the Yellow River dikes. In addition, after dispatching a flood prevention inspection team on June 19th, it is now preparing to dispatch a second flood prevention inspection team.

Xinhua News Agency: The Dagong flood diversion project, built to defend against extraordinarily large Yellow River floods, was completed as planned on June 26th.

With the completion of this flood diversion project, in the event of an extraordinarily large flood in the Yellow River, the area between the Jin Dike and the Taihang Dike near Dagong Village on the north bank of the Yellow River in Fengqiu County, Henan Province, can be used for temporary flood diversion. This project, together with many other temporary flood control projects and dikes, strengthens the downstream area's ability to defend against extraordinarily large Yellow River floods that occur once every ten years before the completion of the Sanmenxia and Yihe and Luohe reservoirs, in order to avoid serious floods.

### 长江水势迅速上涨，黄河洪水可能再发  沿江沿河加紧准备防汛

    长江水势迅速上涨，黄河洪水可能再发
    沿江沿河加紧准备防汛
    新华社武汉1日电　近两天来，长江上、中游水势迅速上涨。六月三十日下午二时，沙市的水位已经超过警戒水位，汉口武汉关前的江面比三天以前升高七公寸多。长江中、下游许多水文站都出现了今年汛期以来的最高水位纪录。
    六月下旬以来，长江流域大部分地区连续下雨。四川、湖北、安徽、江苏等省并且连续降落暴雨，雨量大都在一百公厘以上，致使长江干流和许多支流都出现洪峰。四川嘉陵江流域暴雨以后，嘉陵江北碚水文站出现的洪峰水位，超过了有纪录以来的最高水位一公尺多。从嘉陵江和长江上游干流下泄的洪流在三峡地区又和三峡上下入江的暴雨径流汇合，水势上涨更快，洪流到达宜昌的时候，宜昌水位比五天以前上涨了七公尺以上。同时，长江中、下游由于受附近地区的暴雨影响，近两天内，从城陵矶以下江水普遍上涨三到六公寸以上。另外，汉水最近也出现了一次洪峰。据有经验的水文工作者估计：由于上游洪水的下泄，七月上旬，汉口武汉关的水位将继续保持上涨的趋势。
    目前，荆江大堤上的防汛活动正在加紧进行。沿江各地的防汛器材也正在迅速调集。另外，荆江分洪区进洪闸的防汛分洪准备工作已经完成，今年新建的汉水下游杜家台分洪工程的管理人员，也在加紧安装分洪闸上的照明设备，训练启闭门的民工，积极进行分洪前的准备工作。
    据新华社郑州电　度过第二次洪水以后，要对防汛工作进行全面检查、全面准备，以便迎接可能到来的更大洪水——这是黄河防汛总指挥部在今天向沿黄河各级防汛指挥部发出的指示中提出的要求。
    黄河今年打破了不到七月不入汛的惯例，提前一个月左右在六月入汛。今年六月，黄河已经出现了两次洪水。这两次大水不但来的早，第二次洪水的洪峰还在秦厂、高村、孙口、艾山、洛口等处超过了警戒水位。由于淤垫高了的河底还没有冲刷下去，以致今年的第二次洪峰的流量虽然还赶不上1954年的最大流量，水位却在高村超过了1954年的最高水位两公分。黄河中游地区如果在最近再下大雨，第三次洪水很可能就要到来。因此，黄河防汛总指挥部向黄河各级防汛指挥部提出要求：第二次洪水过去以后，要抓紧第三次洪水还没有到来的空隙，对洪水的特点及河势、工程情况的变化进行一次全面的检查和总结，并且要从思想上、组织上和器材工料等方面做全面的准备，严阵以待第三次洪水的到来。
    黄河防汛总指挥部本身也积极进行准备工作。6月30日下午，组成了有六十多名干部、工程师和工人参加的抢险队；抢险队里有汽车十辆、发电机四部和探照灯等设备，一旦黄河堤坝发生危险，就可以立即驰往抢救。另外，在6月19日派出了防汛检查组以后，现在正筹备派出第二个防汛检查组。
    据新华社讯　为防御黄河特大洪水兴修的大功分洪工程已经在六月二十六日按计划完成了。
    这个分洪工程修成，在黄河发生特大洪水的时候，就可利用河南省封丘县黄河北岸大功村附近金堤和太行堤两堤之间来临时分洪。这个工程和其他许多临时性防洪工程和堤防一起，加强了下游地区三门峡和伊河、洛河水库建成以前，防御黄河发生十年一遇的特大洪水的能力，以避免发生严重水灾。
