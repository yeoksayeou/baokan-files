Xinhua News Agency, July 21st: The report of the Central Supervisory Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Ministry of Supervision of the People's Republic of China regarding the investigation of the case of the state-owned Shenyang Transformer Factory. The full text is as follows:

    The case of disunity among leading cadres, damage to machinery, and harm to production at the state-owned Shenyang Transformer Factory is a very serious one. The main reason for this case is the serious bourgeois individualism among the factory's principal leading cadres. In order to vie for personal power, they undermined the unity of the Party, focusing their main energy on intrigue and mutual recrimination, and abandoning leadership and supervision over production. They led the socialist enterprise with bourgeois management ideas, resorting to fraud to obtain personal honors and bonuses. We believe that lessons should be drawn from this case to strengthen the struggle against various undesirable tendencies in industrial and mining enterprises.

    1. Bourgeois individualism is the ideological root cause of leading cadres vying for power and creating disunity. Disunity among leading cadres in industrial and mining enterprises will inevitably lead to relaxation or abandonment of leadership and supervision over production, even harming the cause of socialist construction. Given the phenomenon of disunity existing among leading cadres in many industrial and mining enterprises, Party organizations should continue to implement the resolutions of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Party and the National Congress of the Party in industrial and mining enterprises, persistently oppose bourgeois individualism, and resolutely and conscientiously overcome any phenomenon of disunity. On the other hand, legitimate principled debates arising from work should also be protected, and conclusions should be drawn in a timely manner after inspection. Do not confuse legitimate principled debates with disunity.

    2. The prolonged existence of serious errors in certain industrial and mining enterprises without timely correction is often related to the bureaucratic style of the higher Party and government leading organs to varying degrees. The Shenyang Transformer Factory case revealed that the Shenyang Municipal Party Committee's leadership over the factory was generalized, and it failed to understand the many serious problems existing in the factory in a timely manner. The Electrical Industry Bureau of the First Ministry of Machine Building Industry has treated the work of the Transformer Factory with a bureaucratic attitude for several years, only listening to good news and not to bad news, trusting false reports. Even when the problems of the Transformer Factory had been somewhat noticed, they did not inspect and correct them, but instead continued to praise them, causing them to easily obtain the honor of "First-Class Factory" in the national electrical engineering system and a large amount of bonuses. This lesson should be remembered. It is necessary to constantly struggle against bureaucratic phenomena in enterprise leadership. Relevant derelict personnel should be given appropriate criticism, and those who have caused serious consequences should also be given due disciplinary action.

    3. It is necessary to resolutely oppose capitalist management thinking in industrial and mining enterprises and earnestly implement the principles of socialist management. Certain leading cadres of the Shenyang Transformer Factory, for the sake of the so-called "interests" of their unit and personal "honor," did not hesitate to adopt bourgeois management methods, did not faithfully implement state plans, and resorted to fraud. They neglected product quality, shipped substandard products as qualified products, and deceived fraternal factories and mines, etc. These are all reflections of capitalist management thinking in socialist enterprises, which have caused extremely serious losses to the cause of socialist construction, and this is completely unacceptable. However, this kind of erroneous thinking still exists in many industrial and mining enterprises today, and it is necessary to constantly wage a resolute struggle against this kind of erroneous thinking to ensure the implementation of socialist management principles.

    4. The reason why bad elements in industrial and mining enterprises dare to carry out sabotage activities rampantly, and some even climb to leadership positions, is inseparable from the serious political numbness of some leading cadres and their neglect of the leading role of the Party and the tendency to neglect political work. Therefore, it is necessary to strengthen the Party's leadership and political and ideological work in industrial and mining enterprises, and oppose the tendency to only manage business and not ask about politics.

    5. It is necessary to strengthen the Party's and state's supervisory work in industrial and mining enterprises. The failure to promptly expose and correct the above-mentioned serious errors of the Shenyang Transformer Factory is inseparable from the weakness of the Party's and state's supervisory work in the factory. The factory's Party Discipline Inspection Committee was controlled by the bad element Yue Zhenshan, and the factory's Supervision Office also showed weakness. The Party's supervisory organs and state supervisory organs at higher levels also failed to go deep into the lower levels to strengthen leadership. This made it impossible to expose and correct errors in a timely manner. All localities should learn from this lesson, attach importance to the Party's and state's supervisory work, promptly establish Party Discipline Inspection Committees in industrial and mining enterprises in accordance with regulations, pay attention to the allocation of supervisory cadres, and conscientiously select Party and state supervisory cadres in accordance with the conditions stipulated by the central government, so that the Party's and state's supervisory organs can play their due role and ensure the smooth progress of the cause of socialist construction.

### 中央监委会和监察部检查这一案件的报告

    中央监委会和监察部检查这一案件的报告
    新华社21日讯　中国共产党中央监察委员会、中华人民共和国监察部关于检查国营沈阳变压器厂案件的报告。全文如下：
    国营沈阳变压器厂领导干部之间闹不团结、损坏机器、危害生产的案件，是一个十分严重的案件。造成这一案件的主要原因，是该厂的主要领导干部存在着严重的资产阶级个人主义思想；他们为了争夺个人权力而破坏党的团结，把自己的主要精力放在勾心斗角、互相倾轧上面，放弃了对生产的领导和监督；他们以资产阶级的经营观点来领导社会主义企业，为了骗取个人荣誉和奖金而弄虚作假。我们认为应该从这个案件中吸取教训，以加强反对工矿企业中各种不良倾向的斗争。
    一、资产阶级个人主义思想，是领导干部争夺权力、闹不团结的思想根源；而工矿企业中领导干部闹不团结，就必定会导致放松或放弃对生产的领导和监督，以至损害社会主义建设事业。鉴于在不少工矿企业的领导干部中存在着不团结的现象，党的组织应该在工矿企业中继续贯彻执行党的七届四中全会和党的全国代表会议的决议，坚持不懈地反对资产阶级个人主义思想，坚决地、认真地克服任何不团结的现象。另一方面，也应当保护从工作出发的正当的原则争论，经过检查，及时得出结论。不要把正当的原则争论和不团结混为一谈。
    二、某些工矿企业中长期存在着严重错误而得不到及时纠正，往往同上级党政领导机关的不同程度的官僚主义作风有关。沈阳变压器厂案件暴露出沈阳市委对该厂的领导一般化，没有及时地了解该厂存在的许多严重问题。第一机械工业部电器工业管理局，几年来以官僚主义的态度对待变压器厂的工作，听喜不听忧，信任假报告；甚至当变压器厂的问题已经有所察觉的时候，也不去检查纠正，反而继续表扬他们，致使他们轻易地骗取了全国电工系统“一等厂”的荣誉和大量奖金。这种教训应当记取。必须经常和企业领导上的官僚主义现象作斗争。对有关的失职人员，应该给予适当批评，造成严重后果者也应当给以应得的纪律处分。
    三、必须坚决反对工矿企业中的资本主义经营思想，切实执行社会主义的经营管理原则。沈阳变压器厂的某些领导干部，为了所谓本单位的“利益”和个人的“荣誉”，不惜采取资产阶级的经营手段，不忠实执行国家计划，弄虚作假；忽视产品的质量，以次品顶合格品出厂，欺骗兄弟厂矿等等，这些都是资本主义经营思想在社会主义企业中的反映，给社会主义建设事业造成了极为严重的损失，这是完全不能容许的。但是这种错误思想至今仍然在不少工矿企业中存在着，必须经常同这种错误思想作坚决的斗争，保证社会主义经营管理原则的贯彻执行。
    四、工矿企业中的坏分子，所以敢于猖獗地进行破坏活动，有的并且爬上了领导岗位，是同有些领导干部存在着严重的政治麻木和忽视党的领导作用、忽视政治工作的倾向分不开的。因此，必须加强工矿企业中党的领导和政治思想工作，反对只管业务不问政治的偏向。
    五、必须加强工矿企业中党的和国家的监察工作。沈阳变压器厂的上述严重错误没有及时揭发与纠正是和该厂党的和国家的监察工作薄弱分不开的。该厂党的纪律委员会掌握在坏分子岳振山手中，该厂监察室也表现软弱无力，上级党的监察机关和国家监察机关也都未能深入下层，加强领导。这就不可能及时揭发和纠正错误。各地应该吸取这一教训，重视党和国家的监察工作，按照规定迅速地在工矿企业中成立党的监察委员会，重视监察干部的配备，切实按照中央规定的条件来选择党的和国家的监察干部，使党的和国家的监察机关发挥其应有的作用，保证社会主义建设事业的顺利进行。
