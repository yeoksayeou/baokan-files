    Central State Organs Convene Party Congress
    Focus on Discussing How Party Organizations Supervise Party Members

    (Our Newspaper News) The Second Congress of the Communist Party of China's Central State Organs was held from June 30th to July 6th. A total of 601 delegates attended this congress, representing more than 40,000 Communist Party members in the central state organs.

    This congress was conducted relatively well, with full democracy promoted and criticism and self-criticism carried out. While affirming the achievements of the Party's work in the state organs, the congress also sharply exposed and criticized shortcomings and errors in the work: the leadership of the state organs' Party committee had shortcomings and errors such as conservatism, bureaucracy, and preoccupation with routine matters, as well as subjective and one-sided impetuosity. For example, in the work of developing new Party members, there was serious conservative closed-doorism; in the past six years or so, only more than 4,000 new Party members were accepted. In the work of Party discipline inspection, more than 500 pieces of materials from mass reports and accusations were accumulated and not processed. On some routine matters, the committee took on too much, causing the Party work of the organs to fall into preoccupation with routine matters. In the arrangement of theoretical education work for the organs, there were shortcomings and errors of subjective and one-sided impetuosity, demanding too much too quickly, causing Party members and the masses to be exhausted and achieving little. The system of collective leadership of the Party committee was unsound, with Party committee meetings held very rarely, and the Party committee existed in name only, losing its actual role of collective leadership, thus delaying many important tasks. The Party committee lacked comprehensive planning in its leadership work, grasping the center but neglecting the Party's daily work. In its work, it also did not pay attention to fully developing the enthusiasm and potential of lower-level Party organizations, and was not good at using and developing the role of activists in various departments. At the same time, it also did not adopt diverse organizational forms and working methods, based on the different situations of different departments of the central state organs.

    The focus of this congress was to discuss how the Party organizations in the organs should supervise Party members, and how to closely combine the Party's work with administrative work. The meeting believed that, due to the particularity of the work of the organs, the Party organizations in the organs cannot lead and supervise the administrative work of the organs, but must supervise the political and ideological situation of every Party member (including administrative heads) in the organs, constantly care about the improvement of the work of the organs, and wage struggle against bureaucracy, formalism, documentalism and other bad tendencies that hinder the smooth progress of the administrative and professional work of the organs, and promptly inform the administrative heads of the organs of the shortcomings and errors in the work of the organs and report them to the higher Party committee up to the Central Committee.

    Regarding the supervisory role of the Party organizations in the organs, the meeting pointed out that supervision should focus on the political and ideological situation of Party members, but when issues involving administrative work are concerned, one cannot ignore them, otherwise the supervision of the political and ideological situation of Party members will be abstracted. The meeting criticized the method of "graded supervision" of Party members proposed by some comrades (i.e., general Party members are supervised by groups, section and department heads are supervised by branches, and bureau and department directors are supervised by Party groups), believing that doing so would inevitably divide Party members into several grades, preventing Party members from receiving criticism and supervision from the bottom up. This is harmful. In order to effectively strengthen the supervision of Party members, especially the supervision of responsible Party cadres, according to past experience, the method of regular "ideological meetings" of leading backbone members, i.e., expanded Party committee meetings attended by Party cadres above the level of bureau and department directors, to conduct criticism and self-criticism, or the form of rectification and the form of regular democratic inspection meetings attended by all staff members of the organs, as well as activist meetings and individual talks, etc., to conduct criticism and self-criticism, are all effective methods.

    The meeting also discussed the issue of collective leadership of the Party committee of the organs.

    Finally, the meeting elected a new Party committee for the state organs and elected delegates to the Eighth National Congress of the Party.

    中央国家机关召开党代表大会
    着重讨论了党组织如何对党员进行监督问题
    本报讯　中国共产党中央国家机关第二次代表大会六月三十日到七月六日举行。出席这次大会的代表共601人，代表着中央国家机关四万多名共产党员。
    这次大会开得比较好，会议中充分发扬了民主，开展了批评与自我批评。代表大会在肯定了国家机关党的工作成绩的同时，也尖锐地揭发和批评了工作中的缺点和错误：国家机关党委领导上存在着保守主义、官僚主义和事务主义，以及主观片面的急躁冒进等缺点和错误。例如在发展新党员的工作上，即存在着严重的保守关门主义，六年多来只接收了四千多名新党员，在党的纪律检查工作上，积压未处理的群众检举和控告的材料即有五百多件；对一些属于事务性的工作，则又包揽过多，致使机关党的工作陷于事务主义；在对机关理论教育工作的布置，则存在要求过急、使党员群众疲于奔命而收效不大的主观片面和急躁冒进的缺点和错误；党委的集体领导制度不健全，党委会议召开次数极少，党委会形同虚设，失去了集体领导的实际作用，因此曾贻误了许多重大工作。党委在领导工作上缺乏全面规划，抓了中心，放松了党的日常工作；在工作中也没有注意充分发挥下级党组织的积极性和潜在力，不善于运用和发挥各部门的积极分子的作用；同时也没有针对中央国家机关不同性质部门的不同情况，采用多种多样的组织形式和工作方法。
    这次大会的中心是讨论机关党组织如何对党员进行监督，以及怎样把党的工作同行政工作密切结合起来的问题。会议认为，由于机关工作的特殊性，机关党组织不能领导和监督机关行政工作，但必须对机关中每一个党员（包括行政负责人）的政治思想情况进行监督，经常关心机关工作的改进，同官僚主义、形式主义、文牍主义以及其他阻碍机关行政业务工作顺利进行的各种不良倾向开展斗争，及时地把机关工作的缺点和错误，通知本机关行政负责人并报告上级党委直至中央。
    关于机关党组织对党员的监督作用问题；会议指出，应该以监督党员的政治思想情况为主，但涉及到行政工作方面的问题时，不能抛开不管，否则就会把对党员的政治思想情况的监督抽象化。会议批判了某些同志提出的对党员实行“分级监督”的办法（即一般党员由小组监督，处、科长由支部监督，司、局长由党组监督），认为这样做，势必把党员分成若干等级，使党员得不到自下而上的批评和监督。这是有害的。为了有效地加强对党员的监督，特别是对负责党员干部的监督，根据过去的经验，可以采用定期的领导骨干“思想见面会”，即吸收司、局长以上党员干部参加的党委扩大会议的形式，进行批评与自我批评，或采用整风的形式和定期召开机关全体工作人员参加的民主检查会议形式，以及积极分子会和个别谈话等形式，进行批评和自我批评，都是行之有效的方法。
    关于机关党委的集体领导问题，会议也作了讨论。
    会议最后选出了国家机关新的党委会，并选出了出席全国第八次党代表大会的代表。
