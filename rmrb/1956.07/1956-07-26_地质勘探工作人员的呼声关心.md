Concerns Voiced by Geological Exploration Workers
    Our Material and Cultural Life
    To the Editors:
    We are geological workers who work in the field for long periods. We sincerely hope that leading comrades from central and provincial departments and representatives of the People's Congress can come to the geological exploration teams to inspect our work and understand our work requirements and living difficulties in a timely manner.
    Comrades working in the field all hope to seize the time to read more books and newspapers, but the supply of books and newspapers is very slow. We often see the day's news newspapers half a month or even a month later. Therefore, comrades reflect: "Old news from the foot of the mountain is still news on the mountain." As for the supply of publications and books, it is not only slow but also small in quantity, and there are even fewer business books related to geological exploration. It is even more untimely for us to watch movies here. We have to wait half a year or a year to see many new movies, and many comrades in remote areas cannot see movies at all.
    In addition, our field staff still have many difficulties in terms of living welfare, such as poor conditions for eating, drinking water, housing, transportation, hygiene, and medical care. Some field teams do not have supply and marketing cooperatives nearby. Employees often have to travel thirty or forty li to buy staple and non-staple foods and daily necessities, and they also have to queue up to buy things, which is really inconvenient.
    These problems cannot be solved by the strength of a team or a department alone without the support of relevant parties.

    Don't Just Focus on Production
    To the Editors:
    We are lathe workers in the repair shop of the 325 Team of the East China Geological Bureau of the Ministry of Geology. In the area where we work, the temperature has often been above 100 degrees in recent days. Workers are covered in sweat during the day, and their bodies are covered in oil and iron filings from head to toe. But after get off work, they cannot find a place to take a bath. At present, our repair shop has been changed to two shifts, day and night. After get off work at night, we are very hungry and cannot find a place to eat. Because our team works in the field, there are no cultural and recreational activities. Under such circumstances, workers have to stay in the dormitory all day on Sundays and other holidays. Our 325 Team has about 400 employees in the team headquarters and repair shop alone. If the administrative leaders only pay attention to production and do not care about solving the specific problems of the employees' living welfare, this is extremely detrimental to production.

    Why Different Pay for the Same Work
    To the Editors:
    When the drilling team of the Hebei Provincial Department of Industry and the 138 drilling team of the Central Ministry of Geology were drilling for coalfields in the Guo'erzhuang area, the employees discovered that the two teams had the phenomenon of different pay for the same work. For example, for the same fourth-grade worker, the salary of the Central 138 Team is 209 wage points, while Hebei Province is 192 wage points. Similarly, the standard for field subsidies is also different. The subsidy for ordinary employees of the 138 Team is 3.5 wage points (equivalent to more than 8 jiao and 6 fen), while the subsidy for Hebei Province is only 3 jiao. These unreasonable phenomena have had a bad impact on our team, hindering the further development of the workers' enthusiasm for production. We hope that the relevant parties will pay attention to solving this type of problem in this wage reform.

    Trade Union Committee Should Supply Test Materials in a Timely Manner
    To the Editors:
    In the experimental research work of the geological department, we often encounter the situation that we cannot buy experimental materials. Especially since the joint state-private ownership of private industrial and commercial enterprises and agricultural cooperativization, all production departments have been carrying out large-scale production, and it has become more difficult to equip the scattered materials we need. Because our work is different from other production departments, many of the things we trial-produce are temporarily designed under new tasks, and some are improved based on new situations found in the work. It is impossible to make an ordering plan in advance; also, because the instrument and machine parts we need are often only one of a kind, or at most a few of the same kind, and do not need to be produced in large quantities. In this way, some factories are unwilling to undertake the production of such parts. Therefore, the designs and creations that we have put a lot of effort into have to be shelved. We know that experimental work always has to be ahead of production and construction, otherwise, how can large-scale construction be carried out? For this reason, we hope that instrument, machine, and tool production and repair organizations should be established in major cities and important industrial and mining areas to serve research and experimental units.

### 地质勘探工作人员的呼声关心

    地质勘探工作人员的呼声关心
    我们的物质和文化生活编辑同志：
    我们是长期在野外工作的地质工作者，我们很希望中央和省的一些部门的领导同志和人民代表大会的代表能够到地质勘探队来视察工作，及时地了解我们工作上的要求和生活上的困难。
    在野外工作的同志都希望抓紧时间多看些书报，但书报供应却十分迟缓。我们经常在半个月甚至一个月以后才看到当天的新闻报纸。因此同志们反映说：“山下的旧闻，传到山上还是新闻。”至于刊物书籍的供应不仅时间慢而且数量少，有关地质勘探的业务书籍就更少了。在我们这里看电影更不及时，许多新影片，我们要在半年或一年后才能看到，很多在边远地区的同志根本看不到电影。
    另外，我们野外工作人员在生活福利方面还有许多困难，如吃饭、喝水、居住、交通、卫生、医疗等条件都很差。有的野外队附近没有供销合作社，职工们要买主食副食及日用百货，经常要跑三、四十里的路，而且还要排队才能买到东西，实在感到十分不方便。
    这样的一些问题，有关方面不给我们支持，仅仅靠一个队或一个部的力量是难以解决的。　沈阳地质勘探公司尖兵不能只顾生产编辑同志：
    我们是地质部华东地质局三二五队修配间的车床工人，在我们工作的地区，这几天的温度常在一百度以上，工人们白天流了满身的汗，从头到脚又沾满了油污和铁砂，下班以后却找不到洗澡的地方。目前我们修配间改为日夜两班，晚上下班以后，肚子很饿也找不到个地方吃东西。因为我们这个队是在野外工作，没有文化娱乐活动。在这样的情况下，每逢星期日和其他假日工人们只好整天呆在宿舍里。我们三二五队仅队部及修配间就有四百左右的职工，如果行政领导上只重视生产，不关心解决职工生活福利方面的具体问题，这是对生产极为不利的。

    为什么同工不同酬编辑同志：
    我们河北省工业厅所属钻探队和中央地质部所属一三八钻探队在郭二庄地区钻探煤田时，职工们发现这两个队有同工不同酬的现象。例如同为一个四级工，中央一三八队的工资是二零九个工资分，河北省却为一九二个工资分。同样，野外补助费的标准也有高低，一三八队一般职员的补助费是三点五个工资分（合八角六分多），而河北省的补助费只有三角。这些不合理的现象，在我们队已经产生了不好的影响，妨碍了工人们的生产积极性的进一步发挥，我们希望在这次工资改革中，有关方面要注意解决这一类的问题。

    工会委员会及时供应试验材料编辑同志：
    在地质部门试验研究工作中，我们常常遇见买不到试验材料的情况，特别在私营工商业公私合营和农业合作化以来，各生产部门都在进行大规模生产，我们所需要的零星材料，配备更加困难。因为，我们的工作和其他生产部门不同，很多试制的东西是在新的任务下临时设计的，也有是根据工作中发现的新情况提出改进的，不可能预先作出订货计划；又因为我们所需要的仪器机械零件，常常是一样一个，至多也不过一样几个，不需要大量生产。这样，有些工厂不愿意承制这种零件，因此，我们费了好多精力的设计创作，只好搁置起来。我们知道，试验工作总是要走在生产和建设前面的，要不然，怎能进行大规模建设呢？为此，我们希望在各大城市和重要工矿企业地区，应该设立仪器机械工具生产修配机构，专门为研究试验单位服务。
