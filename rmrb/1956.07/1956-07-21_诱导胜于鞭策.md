    Inducement is Better Than Whipping
    By our reporter Xiāo Yàn
    In the workshops of the Yantai Machine Tool Accessories Factory, some eye-catching slogans have recently appeared. These were written by the propagandists to promptly spur on those who are lagging behind. In the Third Workshop, Second Work Section, the four people on the row of machines on the south side of the north building were the first to exceed their quotas and receive "Glorious Flowers," while none of the people on the row on the north side received any. At this time, the slogan was posted, reading: "Comrades on the north side, look up! What should you do?" Slogans were also posted in the workshops with fewer "Glorious Flowers"! The slogan "Other workshops are full of flowers, are you worried or not?" was posted. When the propagandist discovered that Meng Qingyu, a third-grade worker who had recently been transferred from another workshop, was not working as fast as his predecessor, Chi Zhentian (an apprentice), on the same machine tool, they posted the slogan "Chi Zhentian works fast, Meng Qingyu works slow, quickly catch up by exchanging experiences!" in front of their machine tools. When Meng Qingyu saw the slogan posted in front of him, and everyone read and shouted the slogan, he felt greatly stimulated. He thought, "This is so embarrassing! A third-grade worker can't keep up with an apprentice! How can I bring myself to learn from Chi Zhentian?" He even thought, "Just transfer me away from this machine tool...". Just as Meng Qingyu's thoughts were going in circles, Li Peiren, a Party member working on a nearby machine tool, felt that it was wrong to stimulate lagging workers by posting slogans. So, he took the initiative to warmly help Meng Qingyu, earnestly talking with him. After Li Peiren's enlightenment and guidance, Meng Qingyu realized that it was a virtue for young people to humbly learn from others, and it was not shameful. He then took the initiative to go to Chi Zhentian to exchange experiences and asked other experienced workers for advice and learning. In just two days, Meng Qingyu's product quantity and quality caught up with Chi Zhentian.

    诱导胜于鞭策 
    本报记者　萧彦
    在烟台机床附件厂的车间里，最近出现了些惹人注意的标语。这是宣传员为了及时鞭策后进的人们而编写的。三车间二工段北屋南边一行机床的四个人，先突破了定额得到光荣花，而北边一行一个也没有。这时标语贴出来了，写道：“北边同志抬头看，你们应该怎么办？”对得光荣花少的车间，也贴上了！“人家车间花儿到处开，你们车间着忙不着忙”的标语。宣传员发现刚从别的车间调来不久的三级工孟庆雨，在同一车床上，不如他的前班迟振田（学徒）干的快，便把写着“迟振田干的快，孟庆雨干的慢，快把经验交流往上赶！”的标语贴在他俩的车床前边。孟庆雨看到标语贴到自己脸前来了，大伙再把标语一念、一嚷，给了他很大刺激，他心里想：“这多丢人啊！三级工赶不上学徒！怎么拉下脸皮向迟振田学习经验呢？”甚至想：“干脆把我调开这部车床吧……”。当孟庆雨思想总转不过弯来的时候，在邻近车床干活的党员李培仁，感到用贴标语来刺激后进的工人是不对的，便主动地、热情地帮助孟庆雨，恳切地和他交谈。经过李培仁的启发诱导，孟庆雨认清了虚心向别人学习是青年人的美德，并不是耻辱，于是便主动地去找迟振田交流经验，并向其他老师傅请教学习。不过两天，孟庆雨的产品数量和质量都赶上了迟振田。
