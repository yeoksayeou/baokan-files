Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, July 9th. On the Nanping-Guantou Railway construction site in Fujian, the sound of blasting to open mountains and build roads echoes all day long, and smoke rises from the verdant slopes from time to time.

The roadbed engineering of this 215-kilometer-long railway, which runs from Nanping through Fuzhou City to Guantou Town in Lianjiang County, is being intensified. A large number of officers and soldiers of the railway corps and civilian workers who built the Yingtan-Xiamen Railway have been transferred to the Nanping-Guantou Railway construction site. The railway corps and civilian workers constructing the northern section of the Nanping-Guantou line have used advanced methods such as "large-scale blasting" and "medium-scale blasting" to blast open the first large excavation on the Nanping-Guantou line - Motian Ridge; a tunnel adjacent to it has also been excavated halfway.

On the Minjiang River, ships and wooden sailboats loaded with steel, cement, and other road-building materials, and wooden and bamboo rafts flowing downstream, are speeding towards various work areas. Rows of construction sheds have appeared in various work areas. Dozens of material supply stations along the line have prepared sufficient grain, oil, salt, vegetables, meat and other non-staple foods for the construction army.

    爆破声终日震响，闽江里船只奔忙
    南平——琯头铁路加紧施工
    新华社福州9日电　福建南平—琯头铁路工地上，终日震响着开山筑路的爆破声，青葱的岭坡上不时腾起烟雾。
    这条215公里长的、从南平经过福州市到达连江县琯头镇的铁路路基工程，正在加紧施工。大批修建鹰厦铁路的铁道兵部队官兵和民工，已转到南琯铁路工地。在南琯线北段施工的铁道兵部队和民工，采用“大爆破”、“中爆破”等先进方法炸开了南琯线上第一座大挖方——摩天岭；和它相邻的一座隧道，也已经挖进了一半。
    闽江江面上，满载着钢筋、水泥等筑路器材的轮船、木帆船，顺流而下的木排、竹排，飞快驰向各工区，一排排筑路工棚已经在各工区出现。沿线几十个物资供应站，已经替筑路大军准备了充足的粮食和油、盐、菜蔬、肉等各种副食品。
