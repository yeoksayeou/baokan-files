    Demands and Opinions on Publishing Houses

    More Agricultural Science Books Should Be Published
    Rural workers, especially technicians at agricultural technology extension stations and agricultural production cooperatives, urgently need to learn agricultural science and technology. However, there are very few agricultural science and technology books available now, especially in small and medium-sized cities and the vast countryside. When you go into a bookstore, you can see many books on politics, theory, and literature, but you can't find books on agricultural science and technology, or there are only some thin pamphlets. However, these pamphlets are far from meeting people's needs for learning agricultural science knowledge. Some rural workers, because they cannot systematically learn agricultural science and technology, often mechanically apply or cannot properly handle some technical measures, which has caused many difficulties in their work. This greatly hinders the training of a large number of agricultural technology cadres to meet the needs of agricultural production.
    I hope that publishing departments will take measures as soon as possible to publish a large number of agricultural science and technology books. Agricultural science research departments and scientists should actively write books in this area for publishing units to publish, in order to meet the urgent requirements of the vast number of rural workers to learn agricultural science and technology.

    Eliminate Unnecessary Complimentary Copies of Publications
    At present, some book and magazine publishers send complimentary copies to a wide range of recipients. For example, the propaganda departments of various municipal Party committees receive complimentary copies of magazines such as "Chinese Workers" and "Reading Monthly," and other departments also have this situation. Other national or local publications are distributed even more widely. I think this is unnecessary. Because, now organizations and groups have a certain amount of book and magazine expenses. If they need that kind of publication, they will subscribe themselves. The Propaganda Department of the Shaoxing Municipal Party Committee of the Communist Party of China had already subscribed to "Reading Monthly," and the publisher sent another complimentary copy. Now we are promoting the expansion of individual subscribers, so it is not necessary to give complimentary copies to individuals. The more complimentary copies published by the publishing house, the more it is not only a waste, but also increases the burden on the majority of readers.
    The purpose of the publisher sending complimentary copies is to expand influence and attract more readers to read it. If so, I think you can publish more advertisements in newspapers and magazines, or send long-term subscribers some book and magazine catalogs. Of course, mutual complimentary copies and exchange of publications between some publishing houses are still acceptable.

    Publish Books with More Planning
    The People's Daily published an editorial on July 4th, "Saving Paper from All Aspects," which criticized the phenomenon of waste of paper by publishing and distribution departments. These criticisms are pertinent. Taking Shandong as an example, there is a phenomenon of blindly increasing the number of books in stock. For example, "Questions and Answers on Soviet Collective Farms" was printed twice with 480,000 copies, but only 340,000 copies were sent out, with 140,000 copies in stock; "Experience of Upgrading Primary Agricultural Cooperatives to Advanced Agricultural Cooperatives" (1) was printed with 300,000 copies, with 110,000 copies still in stock; "Practical Manual of Agricultural Machinery and Equipment" was printed with 350,000 copies, with 120,000 copies still in stock. There are about 1 million copies in stock, accumulating about 4,000 reams of paper. This has created a tense situation of paper and printing, which not only stockpiles a large number of books, but also makes it impossible to supply books needed by many readers, such as political theory and cultural education books, which are out of stock.
    The phenomenon of duplicate versions in publishing is also very serious. There are no less than 20 kinds of pamphlets on eliminating the four pests published nationwide. Such examples are too numerous to mention. When the publishing house publishes a new book, Xinhua Bookstore knows that the version is duplicated, but it has to purchase the book. Otherwise, it will violate the first provision of the production and sales agreement. This provision is: all publications published by the publisher shall be distributed by the bookstore, and the bookstore shall not refuse. This creates difficulties for the distribution side in purchasing and for readers in purchasing. I am not saying that only one kind of book can be published, but that publishing departments should have plans and division of labor when publishing books, and should not "overpublish."

    Small Number and High Prices of Scientific Books
    Since the Party put forward the call to march towards science, the broad masses of people across the country, especially the vast number of young intellectuals on various fronts, have actively responded to this call and joined the ranks of marching towards science. One of the main difficulties they encounter on the way to march towards science is the insufficient supply of scientific books.
    The types and number of scientific books published now are really too small. Most of the existing ones are incomplete, some have the first volume but not the second, and some have the second volume but not the first. Except for large cities, where the supply of scientific books is relatively abundant, there are even fewer scientific books in bookstores in small and medium-sized cities.
    In addition, the prices of general scientific books are very high, one or even several times more expensive than other types of books printed on the same paper.
    Can the relevant publishing authorities change the phenomenon of the small number and high prices of scientific books?

### 对出版社的要求和意见

    对出版社的要求和意见
    多出版农业科学书籍
    农村工作人员，特别是农业技术推广站和农业生产合作社的技术人员，都迫切要求学习农业科学技术知识。可是，目前农业科学技术书籍非常少，特别是在中、小城市和广大的农村里，更买不到这方面的书籍。走进书店，可以看到很多政治、理论和文艺等方面的书，却看不见农业科学技术方面的书，或者只有一些内容单薄的小册子；但是，这些小册子已经远远不能满足人们学习农业科学知识的要求了。有些农村工作人员，因为不能系统地学习农业科学技术方面的知识，对于一些技术措施常常生搬硬套或者无法处置，工作中发生了不少困难。这对于培养大量的农业技术干部，适应农业生产的需要，是有很大妨碍的。
    我希望出版部门尽快地采取措施，出版大量的农业科学技术书籍。农业科学研究部门和科学家们应该积极编写这方面的书籍，供给出版单位出版，满足广大农村工作干部学习农业科学技术的迫切要求。

    取消不必要的赠阅书刊
    目前，有些书刊出版社赠阅书刊的面很广，如各市委宣传部都接到赠阅的“中国工人”、“读书月报”等杂志，别的一些部门也有这种情况。其他还有一些全国性或地方性的书刊赠阅更广更多。我认为这是不必要的。因为，现在机关、团体等都有一定的书刊费，如果需要那种刊物，他们自己会订阅的。中共绍兴市委宣传部里本来就订了“读书月报”，出版社又赠阅了一本。现在正在提倡扩大个人订户，因此赠阅个人也大可不必。出版机关赠阅的数量多了，不仅是一种浪费，而且加重广大读者的负担。
    出版社赠阅的目的是为了扩大影响，吸引更多的读者去读它。如果是这样，我认为可以通过报刊多登一些广告，或者送长期订户一些书刊目录等。当然，一些出版机关的相互赠阅和交换书刊还是可以的。　　　　　　　　　姚峙夏
    出书要更有计划
    七月四日人民日报发表“从各方面节约纸张”的社论，对出版、发行部门浪费纸张的现象提出批评。这些批评是中肯的。以山东来说，在图书的备货上有盲目增加数量的现象。如“苏联集体农庄问答”两次印了48万册，只发出34万册，存货14万册；“初级农业社升高级农业社的经验”（一）印了30万册，尚存11万册；“农业药械实用手册”印35万册，尚存12万册。存货约有100万册，积压纸张约4，000令。这就造成了纸张和印刷的紧张状况，既积压了大批书，又使许多读者需要的书供应不上，如政治理论、文化教育等类图书，都发生脱销现象。
    出版方面版本重复的现象也很严重。有关除四害的小册子，全国出版了不下20种，这种事例举不胜举。出版社出了新书，新华书店明知版本重复也得进货。否则，就违犯产销协议第一条规定。这条规定是：出版社出版之出版物全部交书店发行，书店不得拒绝。这就造成发行方面进货和读者购买的困难。我不是说，一种书只能出版一种，而是说出版部门出书要有计划，有分工，不要“滥出”。

    科学书籍数量少价格高
    自从党提出了向科学进军的号召以后，全国广大人民、特别是各个战线上的广大知识青年，都积极地响应这一号召，投入了向科学进军的行列。他们在向科学进军途中所遇到的主要困难之一是科学书籍的供应不足。
    现在科学书籍出版的种类和数量真是太少了。已经有的，也大都残缺不全，有的有上册没有下册，有的有下册又没有上册。全国除大城市的科学书籍供应比较充裕外，在中小城市书店里，科学书籍更少。
    此外，一般科学书籍的价格都很高，比用同等纸张印刷的其他性质的书籍要贵一倍甚至好几倍。
    有关出版机关能不能改变科学书籍数量少、价格贵的现象呢？
