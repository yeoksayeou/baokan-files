	Transfer to a Mountain Village
	Zhong He
	The setting sun leaned against the edge of the western hills, shining on the river surface, still slightly dazzling. Old Li sat in the cargo hold, constantly looking at the sky, complaining that the boat was moving too slowly.

	As the cargo ship approached Lishan, Old Li, gazing at the familiar villages on both banks, couldn't help but hum a mountain song:

	Joyful things are endless to tell,
	Clear waters, beautiful mountains, and good families.

	Old Li's work at the supply and marketing cooperative only started the year before last.

	The year before last, during the Qingming Festival, he returned to his hometown, which he had left for more than ten years, with his red-covered demobilized soldier certificate. His hometown was completely different from the past "poor mountains, sad waters, and suffering families," and every village was thriving. He thought: What can I, this old soldier, do for my hometown? After being idle for a few days, the township asked him to be a salesman at the supply and marketing cooperative. He thought for a while, "Am I suitable for doing business?" But he didn't say anything and accepted the task.

	One drizzly afternoon, the cooperative was damp and sticky, and Old Li leaned against the counter, idly gazing. An old woman stepped into the doorway and handed Old Li an oil bottle, saying, "I want four liang of soy sauce." Old Li thought to himself, "This attitude is so uncomfortable!" He didn't respond, listlessly picked up the bottle, and started pouring. Unexpectedly, the funnel slipped, and soy sauce flowed down the neck of the bottle onto the counter. He felt ashamed and hurriedly handed the bottle to the old woman. She looked at him, didn't say anything at first, then softly reproached, "That's everyone's money!"

	Old Li still remembers the old woman's expression very clearly. Since then, Old Li began to carefully pay attention to the affairs of the cooperative. People often saw him wearing his faded yellow military uniform, busily going in and out.

	By December, there was even more to do. One snowy night, the northwest wind outside was blowing harder and harder. He was calculating accounts in the room, waiting for someone from the township to come and get kerosene to light the lamps for a cadres' meeting. After waiting for a long time, no one came, probably because the road was difficult to travel or they couldn't spare anyone. He thought about asking someone passing by to take it, but there wasn't a single figure on the small path along the riverbank in front of the door. "Can a good meeting be held without lamps?" Thinking this, he immediately grabbed the bottle filled with kerosene, told his companion, and went out. The road to the meeting place was originally uneven and wild, and the snow these past two days had made it even more muddy and difficult to walk. Old Li, who was getting on in years, slipped several times after walking only half a li, and the snow water filled his shoes, icing his bone where the shrapnel had injured him, making it ache and go numb. Old Li finally managed to reach the meeting place, handed over the kerosene, and a group of young people surrounded him, excitedly shouting:

	"Uncle Liberation Army, Comrade Old Li, you have given us light!"

	In the autumn of the following year, Old Li and his companions did their best to purchase the locally abundant Mao bamboo, much to the joy of the mountain people. The Mao bamboo here had been difficult to sell for several years, which inevitably affected the lives of the mountain people. How could Old Li sit idly by? He discussed the reasons for the poor sales with everyone, investigated the production, and learned about the sales destinations, running around to make connections. Firstly, there was external demand, and secondly, there was support from higher authorities and various parties. A series of problems that had not been resolved in the past, such as prices and transportation, were solved, and there were more outlets for Mao bamboo. The mountain people watched rows and rows of bamboo rafts heading downstream. They all discussed: They had never sold so much bamboo before, thanks to Old Li and the others for their efforts! That's right, bamboo itself has also been put to great use. For generations, they only knew that Mao bamboo could be used to make bamboo goods, but they didn't know that it could now replace "steel bars" to build buildings!

	Today, Old Li brought back a boatload of goods that the mountain people needed. "I am still suitable for doing business! How wonderful it is to work for this eternally beautiful mountain village!" Old Li thought, and the boat was almost at the dock.

    转业在山村
    钟赫
    夕阳斜傍在西山岭边，照着河面，还微微耀眼。老黎坐在货舱里，不住望望天色，怪船行得慢了。
    货船驶近了里山，老黎望着两岸熟悉的村庄，不禁哼着山歌：
    欢乐事情说不完，
    清水秀山好人家。
    老黎做供销社工作，还是前年的事。
    前年清明时分，他拿着红皮面的复员军人证书，回到了这个阔别十多年的家乡来。家乡完全不是过去那种“穷山愁水苦人家”的样子了，村村兴旺。他想：家乡有什么事情好让我这老军人来做呢？闲住了几天，乡里要他当供销社营业员。他呆想了一阵：“我做生意合适么？”但他没说二话，接受了任务。
    一个细雨绵绵的下午，社里潮粘粘的，老黎靠着柜台闲望。一个老大娘一脚跨进门来，递给老黎个油瓶说：“要四两酱油。”老黎心想：“这态度，多不舒服！”他也不应声，没精打采地拿起瓶子就灌。不料漏斗一滑，一股酱油顺着瓶颈淌到柜上。他觉得惭愧起来，慌忙把瓶递给老大娘，人家看了看他，先没言语，随后又低低地责备似地说了一句：“大家的钱哪！”
    那老大娘的脸色，老黎至今记得很清楚。自那回以后，老黎开始细心地注意起社里的事情来了。人们常见他穿着那件褪了色的黄军衣进进出出忙碌着。
    到了腊月，事情更多。一个雪后的夜晚，外面西北风一阵紧一阵，他在屋里算账，一面等着乡里来人拿火油点灯开干部会。看看又过了半晌，不见人来，想是路难走或是派不出人来。叫一个顺路人带去吧，可是门前这河岸小路上早没一个人影了。“没有灯能开好会吗？”他想着，立刻拿上那装火油的瓶子，向同伴交代了一声，就出门去了。往会场去的路本是七高八低的野荒路，这两天下雪弄得夹泥夹水的更难走了。上了年纪的老黎，才走了半里多，就一连滑了几跤，雪水满进鞋里，冰得那弹片伤过的脚骨又痛又麻。老黎好不容易挨到会场，交出火油，一群年青人猛地把他围住，兴高采烈地叫道：
    “解放军伯伯，老黎同志，你给我们光明啦！”
    第二年秋里，老黎和同伴们尽力收购了这里盛产的毛竹，山民们个个欢喜。这里毛竹滞销了好几年了，山民生活不免受到影响。老黎那能坐视，就和大家研究滞销原因，调查产量，了解销地情况，奔来跑去的接头。一来外面需要，二来上级和各方面的支持，解决了价格、运输等一系列过去没解决的问题，毛竹出路多了。山民眼望着成排成排的竹筏顺水奔去。都谈论着：从来没有卖掉过这么多的竹子，多亏老黎他们出大力啊！可也是，竹子自己也派了大用场了。祖祖辈辈传下来只知道毛竹能做毛竹货，不知道现在能代替“钢筋”造楼房哩！
    今天，老黎又办了一船山民们需要的货回来了。“我做生意还合适哩！为这个永远美丽的山乡工作，多么好啊！”老黎想着想着，船已快到码头了。
