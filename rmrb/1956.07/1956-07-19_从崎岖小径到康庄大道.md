III. Adapting "Fifteen Strings of Cash"

Under the leadership and with the participation of the Zhejiang Provincial Bureau of Culture and the Provincial Federation of Literary and Art Circles at the end of last year, we revised the Kunqu opera "Fifteen Strings of Cash." We had always been troubled by the profundity of Kunqu, which made it difficult for audiences to understand. Today, being able to perform such a popular and easily understandable Kunqu opera with strong realistic educational significance makes everyone very excited. This is truly our long-cherished wish, and we sincerely thank the Party for leading us to do such meaningful good things. Most of the lyrics in "Fifteen Strings of Cash" have been revised, and we have re-composed the music. It only took us twenty days from revision to rehearsal. The role assigned to me was that of Kuang Zhong. Originally, I had always played young male roles, but Kuang Zhong was to be played by an old male role, which made it difficult for me to accept this role initially. But after accepting the role, I tried to study how to integrate the movements of young and old male roles to express Kuang Zhong's steady, serious, and refined demeanor. I also tried to break away from stylized performances, making each movement purposeful, concise, and not repetitive. I love Kuang Zhong, I play Kuang Zhong, and I strive to express his noble qualities, which also educates me very well. I hate Guo Yu Zhi and Lou A Shu. I use the feelings I once had of hating reactionary bureaucrats and local bullies to understand Kuang Zhong's struggle against them and his plea for the people. The entire rehearsal period was very exciting and pleasant.

On April 1st of this year, with the approval of the Zhejiang Provincial Bureau of Culture, our Guofeng Kunsu Opera Troupe was changed to the publicly-owned Zhejiang Provincial Kunsu Opera Troupe. This made us even more excited. At the celebration of our troupe becoming publicly owned, many comrades were moved to tears. From then on, we forever ended our wandering life and lonely explorations. The Party's warm hand led us onto a broad avenue.

During our performance in Beijing, we had the honor of performing for the leading comrades of the Party Central Committee. When we finished the performance and took our bows, we saw Chairman Mao and other central leaders smiling and applauding us. We were so excited that we almost jumped up. This was something we could never have dreamed of before. I understand that the Party is giving us honor to encourage us to work harder and move forward. (To be continued)

    三、改编“十五贯”
    去年年底在浙江省文化局、省文联的领导和参与下，我们整理了昆曲“十五贯”。我们一直苦于昆曲深奥，观众不易看懂，今天能够上演这样通俗易懂而又具有强烈现实教育意义的昆剧，大家都非常兴奋。这真是我们多年的愿望，衷心地感谢党领导我们作了这样有意义的好事情。“十五贯”的大部分唱词都改动了，我们重新填了谱。从整理到排演只用了二十天时间。我分配到的角色是况钟。本来我一直是演小生的，而况钟是要由老生来演的，这点使我最初接受这一角色时感到困难。但是接受了这个角色之后，我就设法研究如何把小生和老生的动作融汇在一起，用来表现况钟的稳重严肃而又文雅的风度，我并且尝试打破程式化的表演，使得每个动作都有目的性，简练而不重复。我爱况钟，饰演况钟，努力表达出他的高贵品质，同时也使我自己受到了很好的教育，我恨过于执和娄阿鼠，我以过去憎恨反动官僚和地痞流氓的心情来体会况钟同他们进行斗争、为民请命的心情。整个排演期间，我们都是非常兴奋而愉快的。
    今年四月一日经浙江省文化局批准我们国风昆苏剧团改为公营浙江省昆苏剧团。这使我们更加振奋。在庆祝我们剧团改为公营的大会上，不少同志感动得满眶热泪。从此我们永远结束了流浪生活和孤独的摸索，党的温暖的手把我们领上了康庄大道。
    在北京演出的时候，我们得到了为党中央领导同志演出的荣幸。当演完谢幕的时候，我们看到毛主席和其他中央领导同志向我们微笑鼓掌，我们简直激动得跳了起来。这是我们从前作梦都想不到的事。我明白，党给我们荣誉，是鼓励我们更努力地前进。　　（未完）
