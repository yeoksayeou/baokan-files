    Lost Ancient Qin Score Discovered in Sichuan
    (Our Dispatch) The long-lost ancient qin score "Qin Yuan Xin Chuan" has recently been found in Chongqing. This is a qin score compiled by Kong Xingyou, a qin player during the Shunzhi and Kangxi periods of the Qing Dynasty, which compiles qin scores from the Ming Dynasty and the early Qing Dynasty. In the past, everyone thought that only the Library of Congress in the United States possessed this extremely precious Chinese document. During a recent interview in Chengdu, the ancient qin interview team led by ancient qin expert Zha Fuxi also discovered a Taoist music engraving "Quan Zhen Zheng Yun" at the Qingyang Palace, which is the most complete set of works in the Taoist music system. The Buddhist music "Chan Zong Zan Song" they found in the Wenshu Monastery in Chengdu is also more strict and complete in terms of form, musical instruments, and performance specifications than those preserved in other places.

    失传的古琴谱在四川发现
    本报讯　久被认为失传的古琴谱“琴苑心传”最近已在重庆寻获。这是一部清代顺治、康熙年间古琴家孔兴诱汇编的明代和清初的琴谱。过去大家都以为只有美国国会图书馆才存有这部我国极为珍贵的文献。以古琴专家查阜西为首的古琴采访小组最近在成都市采访期间，还在青羊宫发现了道教音乐刻本“全真正韵”，这是道教音乐中体系最完整的成套作品。他们在成都文殊院找到的佛教音乐“禅宗赞颂”，从形式、乐器、演出规格上讲也比其它地方保存的更严格和完整。
