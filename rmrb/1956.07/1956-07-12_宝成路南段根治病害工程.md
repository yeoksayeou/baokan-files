Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, July 11th. After the completion of track laying on the southern section of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway, vigorous efforts are being made to radically cure diseases along the line. Among the workers in the track-laying section for this year, 60% have remained to carry out this work.

On the line stretching over 200 kilometers from Guangyuan, Sichuan, to Huangsha River, Gansu, trains are transporting engineering materials to various construction sites. On both banks of the Jialing River, the rumbling sound of quarrying stone can still be heard. At 186 disease-affected work sites that require continued radical cure, prevention work such as slope trimming and drainage is already underway.

The terrain and geological conditions on the southern section of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway are complex. Due to rock weathering and groundwater, natural collapses, landslides, and debris flows have occurred in many places. This year, the Jialing River's flood season came particularly early and aggressively, preventing some planned disease prevention projects from being completed on time. These disease projects can only be progressively cured after the urgent task of restoring the line is completed.

    宝成路南段根治病害工程
    新华社成都11日电　宝成铁路南段铺轨完成之后，正在大力进行根治沿线的病害工程。在今年度的铺轨地段的工人当中，有60％的工人已经留下来进行这项工作。
    从四川广元至甘肃黄沙河二百多公里的线路上，列车拉着工程材料运到了各个施工点。现在嘉陵江的两岸，依然可以听到开采片石的隆隆炮声。186处需要继续进行根治的病害工点，已经开始刷坡、排除水患等防治工作。
    宝成铁路南段的地形同地质情况复杂，因为岩石风化和地下水的关系，好些地方都出现天然崩坍、山坡滑动和流石流泥现象。今年嘉陵江水来得特别早、特别猛，使预计的一些防治病害的工程没有来得及好做，只能在抢通线路的紧急工作告一段落以后，再来逐步根治这些病害工程。
