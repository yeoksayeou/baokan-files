    Can it be "Left Unresolved"?
    Several responsibility accidents have occurred successively this year in the subordinate cooperatives of the Miao Autonomous County Supply and Marketing Cooperative in the Great Miao Mountains of Guangxi, causing huge losses to the people's property. For example, in January of this year, more than 110,000 catties of tree seeds purchased by the Antai District Cooperative rotted and deteriorated due to lax acceptance, poor storage, and untimely transportation, resulting in a loss of more than 10,000 yuan; Another example is that the Gunbei District Cooperative purchased a batch of tree seeds but did not pay the farmers in cash, issuing many "IOUs"; Later, because all the seeds rotted, the debt owed to the farmers has never been repaid. Also in January of this year, the deputy director of the Zhongzhai District Cooperative, without asking for instructions, arbitrarily sold a large quantity of seasonal and popular commodities on credit, but the payment for the goods could not be recovered at all. As a result, the supply and marketing cooperative had to rely on loans from the state to survive.
    After these accidents occurred, the county supply and marketing cooperative felt that the problem was serious and reported the situation to the Party committee and the superior cooperative. However, the leading organs did not investigate. As time passed, the county cooperative simply let it go. Someone wrote to the Guangxi Daily to report the tree seed rotting incident, and the newspaper also published it, but the matter was still not dealt with.
    In my opinion, the leading organs' attitude of letting these accidents go unresolved will inevitably lead to lax discipline in these departments. They should seriously deal with these accidents in order to learn from them, educate cadres, and improve their work.

### 能“不了了之”吗

    能“不了了之”吗
    广西大苗山苗族自治县供销合作社所属下级社，今年连续发生几宗责任事故，使人民财产遭受了巨大的损失。例如今年一月，安太区社收购的树种，因为验收不严、保管不善和调运不及时，霉烂变质了十一万多斤，损失达一万多元；又如滚贝区社收购一批树种，没有给农民现款，打了很多“白条”；后来因为种子全部霉烂，欠农民的这笔账就一直没还。也是今年一月，中寨区社副主任未经请示，擅自将时令畅销商品大批赊销，而货款却根本收不回来，结果供销社只好靠向国家贷款过日子。
    这些事故发生以后，县供销社感到问题严重，曾经向党委和上级社反映了这些情况。但是，领导机关没有追究。时间久了，县社也就听之任之了。有人给广西日报写信反映树种霉烂的事件，报纸也刊登了，但是事情还是没有得到处理。
    我认为，领导机关对这些事故所采取的不了了之的态度，结果必然会使这些部门的纪律松弛。他们应该认真处理这些事故，以便吸取教训，教育干部，来改进工作。
