    At the Beijing Emergency Station
    Dian Yi
    Outside the window, the rain continued to patter, and the emergency station's duty room was so quiet that all that could be heard was the ticking of the clock.
    The duty officer was carefully examining the empty bed situation reported by the city's hospitals tonight under the lamp. The sharp ringing of the telephone broke the silence of the room, and the duty officer hurriedly picked up the receiver. "What? ... Unconscious ... Have you asked a nearby doctor for a diagnosis? ..."
    "Hello, where is it? ... 26 Fuyou Street." The duty car driver, who had entered the room unnoticed, took the receiver and asked the other party for the detailed address.
    Dr. He, who was on duty, also came in to take the first-aid kit and oxygen cylinder. I followed him onto the ambulance.
    Everything happened so suddenly. The call came at 8:12, and three minutes later, the car had already driven into the courtyard behind a large building. The courtyard and stairs were filled with people, waiting anxiously. They breathed a sigh of relief when they saw the doctor. The patient was lying on a recliner in a room upstairs, pale-faced, but had already regained consciousness and was still groaning in pain. After diagnosing him, Dr. He believed that his condition had improved and decided to send the patient to the nearby Beijing Municipal Seventh Hospital for treatment.
    By 8:30, we had already left the Seventh Hospital and were on our way back.
    The car driver told me that this trip was the closest and the patient's condition was relatively mild. This afternoon, he had gone to Changping, dozens of miles from the city, to save a person who had been electrocuted. In the past, he had also been to Gu'an, Liangxiang, and Tongxian. I also heard the driver's remarks from the two station directors at the emergency station. They told me that the emergency station was established last year and now has more than a dozen medical personnel who take turns on duty day and night. The emergency station is equipped with four ambulances, which are dispatched at any time when something happens for rescue. The city's hospitals report the situation of empty beds to the emergency station twice a day so that they can send critically ill patients to the nearest hospital with empty beds in the shortest possible time. In the past year, they have saved many people from the brink of death, including those injured in accidents in factories, construction sites, and traffic, as well as patients with acute poisoning, difficult labor, drowning, or acute attacks of chronic diseases. At the busiest times, they have dispatched cars more than 20 times a day. Station Director Zhang told me that the emergency station is a new medical institution, and the manpower and ambulances are currently insufficient. The emergency station is preparing to train a group of emergency personnel among the residents to organize a city-wide emergency network.
    When I bid farewell to the emergency station, the rain had stopped, and the bright red characters "Beijing Emergency Station Telephone 5th Bureau 5678" shone brightly on the wall under the street lights. How important is the telephone number "55678" to the citizens of the capital!

    在北京市急救站
    甸义
    窗外还在淅沥地下着雨，急救站值班室内宁静得除了时钟滴?滴?的响声以外，就什么也听不到了。
    值班员正在灯下细心察看着今晚市属各医院汇报来的空床位情况。一声刺耳的电话铃声划破了室内的沉寂，值班员急忙拿起听话筒，“什么？……昏迷……有没有请附近医生诊断过？……”
    “喂，在什么地方？……府右街二十六号”值班的汽车司机不知什么时候进来的，他接过听话筒详细地问明了对方的地址。
    值班的贺大夫也进来取走急救包和氧气袋。我紧随着他一起登上急救车。
    一切发生得这么突然，八点十二分接到电话，过三分钟汽车已经开进一幢大楼后的院子。院子里和楼梯上下都站满了人，他们正在焦虑地等待着，一见到大夫才松了一口气。病人躺在楼上一个房间的躺椅上，面色苍白，这时已经苏醒过来，还在痛苦地呻吟着。贺大夫给他诊断之后，认为病情已有好转，决定把病人送到附近北京市立第七医院去治疗。
    八点半钟我们已经离开了第七医院，踏上归途。
    汽车司机告诉我，这次出车是最近的一次，病人病情也是较轻的。今天下午他就曾去离城几十里的昌平救一个触电的人，过去还去过固安、良乡和通县。司机的这番话，我在急救站两位站长那里也听说过。他们对我说，急救站成立在去年，现在有十几名医务人员，每天昼夜轮流值班。急救站配备有四辆急救车，发生了事情随时派出急救车进行抢救。市属各医院每天向急救站汇报两次空床位的情况，这样他们就能在最短时间内把急病人送到最近的有空床位的医院去。一年来他们从死亡的边缘救活了不少人，其中有在工厂、工地和交通发生事故受伤的，也有急性中毒、难产、溺水或慢性病急性发作的病人。最忙的时候曾一天出车二十多次。张站长对我说，急救站是一个新的医疗机构，目前人力和急救车都感到不足，急救站正准备在居民当中训练一批急救人员，以便组织全市的急救网。
    告别急救站的时候雨已停止，路灯照射着墙壁上“北京市急救站电话五局五六七八”几个大红字闪闪发光，“五五六七八”这个电话号码对首都市民来说是多么重要啊！
