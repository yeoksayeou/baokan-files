Readers, Authors, Editors
This newspaper frequently receives letters from readers and authors offering various criticisms and suggestions regarding the newspaper; simultaneously, the editorial department of this newspaper frequently has hopes and requests regarding readers and authors. Therefore, we are opening a "Readers, Authors, Editors" column in the newspaper in order to promptly publish these opinions and further strengthen the connection between readers, authors, and editors. Editorial Department

Hoping Writers Will Write More Essays
The People's Daily published Ba Ren's "Kuang Zhong's Pen" on May 6th. It was an outstanding essay. I read it three times in a row. I hope the People's Daily will frequently publish articles that criticize current malpractices like this; I hope the older generation of writers—like Ba Ren and others—will use the sharp weapon of essays more often in the future. (Shen Zhan)

More Important is Setting an Example
Recently, various newspapers have exposed many instances of poor product quality, criticizing units producing low-quality products, thereby promoting improvements in product quality. This is very good; doing so is absolutely necessary.

However, I believe that doing just this is not enough. More importantly, we should commend and encourage units producing good quality products, setting examples so that these advanced units can drive the backward units. Although newspapers have praised some units, it is not enough; as for introducing experiences on how to improve product quality, that is even less so. This is a shortcoming of various newspapers in promoting improved product quality, and I hope it will be improved in the future. (Li Yongcheng)

Publish More Articles on Handicraft Industry Transformation
We are engaged in handicraft work. We request that the People's Daily publish more articles on the transformation of the handicraft industry to help us learn and work. (Yang Xinglu Guo Zhencheng)

What Kind of Manuscripts Does the Supplement Need?
The supplement of this newspaper (the upper half of page 8) needs the following manuscripts:

\tI. Short essays, miscellaneous articles, short political commentaries with literary color, social criticism, and literary criticism;
\tII. Prose, sketches, quick sketches, short reports, satirical pieces, travel notes, diaries, letters with literary color, memoirs;

专栏：读者  作者  编者

    读者  作者  编者
    本报经常收到读者和作者的来信，对报纸提出各种批评和建议；同时，本报编辑部对读者和作者，也经常有些希望和要求。因此，我们在报纸上辟“读者、作者、编者”一栏，以便及时地把这些意见发表出来，进一步密切读者、作者和编者的联系。　编辑部
    希望作家多写杂文
    五月六日人民日报刊载巴人作的“况钟的笔”，这是一篇出色的杂文，我曾经一连读了三遍。我希望像这样针砭时弊的文章，人民日报能经常刊登；希望老一辈的作家，——像巴人等，今后多多使用杂文这一锐利的武器。　（沈展）
    更重要的是树立榜样
    各个报纸最近揭发了很多产品质量低劣的现象，批评了生产质量低劣产品的单位，因而促进了产品质量的提高，这是很好的；这样做是完全必要的。
    但是我认为光这样是不够的，更重要的是应该表扬、鼓励生产质量好的产品的单位，树立榜样，以便通过这些先进单位带动落后单位。报纸虽也曾经表扬过一些单位，但是做的很不够；至于介绍如何提高产品质量的经验，那就更少了。这是各个报纸在宣传提高产品质量方面的一个缺点，希望今后加以改进。　（李永成）
    多发表些关于手工业改造的文章
    我们是作手工业工作的，我们要求人民日报多发表一些有关手工业改造方面的文章，帮助我们学习和工作。　（杨兴禄　郭振诚）
