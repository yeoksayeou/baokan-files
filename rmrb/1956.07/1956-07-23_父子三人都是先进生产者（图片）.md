    Father and Three Sons are All Advanced Producers (Picture)
    Zhao Fengyi, Zhao Wencai, and Zhao Wenzhang, father and sons from the mechanical repair shop of Tangshan Qixin Cement Factory, have recently been selected as advanced producers. The father, Zhao Fengyi, is a casting worker. He improved the sandblasting machine, and three people can now complete the work that twenty people could not complete before. Lathe worker Zhao Wencai improved his operating methods, increasing work efficiency fivefold. The wooden pattern group led by Zhao Wenzhang has continuously completed production tasks from January to June this year and has repeatedly won the workshop's red banner of excellence.

    父子三人都是先进生产者（图片）
    唐山启新水泥厂机械修配厂的赵凤仪、赵文才和赵文章父子三人，最近都被选为先进生产者。父亲赵凤仪是浇注工人，他改进了吹砂机，三个人就能完成原来二十个人还完不成的工作。车工赵文才改进了操作方法，提高工作效率五倍多。赵文章领导的木样小组，从今年一月到六月，连续完成生产任务，屡次获得车间优胜红旗。这是赵文才（左）、赵文章（中）在帮助父亲画图纸。  洪勋摄（新华社稿）
