Xinhua News Agency, Washington, July 26th: British Prime Minister Eden's speech in the House of Commons has caused unease in the United States. The "New York Times" said on July 25th that "due to previous indications that British defense spending would be greatly reduced, and Eden's emphasis on greater flexibility, including increased friendship with the Soviet Union," this has strengthened a certain feeling of wavering in the United States.

The "New York Times" said: "Although Western viewpoints are basically consistent, some will undoubtedly make efforts to contrast Britain's flexibility with the tough policy allegedly sponsored by Dulles." The newspaper pointed out that, so far, Britain's "flexibility" is mainly manifested in increasing trade with the Soviet Union and other countries in the socialist camp, and Eden's proposal to discuss limiting nuclear weapons tests outside of disarmament negotiations.

Reuters' Washington correspondent said that American officials "were surprised" by Eden's plan to limit nuclear weapons tests.

    艾登强调政策要灵活华盛顿方面颇感不安
    据新华社26日讯华盛顿消息：英国首相艾登在下院辩论中的发言引起了美国的不安。“纽约时报”七月二十五日说，“由于先前有迹象表明英国防御开支要大大削减，同时艾登强调应当有更大程度的灵活性，包括增加对苏联的友谊在内”，这就加强了美国某种动摇不定的感觉。
    “纽约时报”说：“尽管西方的观点基本上是一致的，但是有人无疑将作出努力来把英国的灵活性同据说是杜勒斯所赞助的强硬政策作个对比。”这家报纸指出，到目前为止，英国的“灵活性”主要表现在增加同苏联和社会主义阵营其他国家的贸易上和艾登认为可以在裁军谈判之外讨论限制核子武器试验的主张上。
    路透社驻华盛顿记者说，美国官员对艾登的限制核子武器试验计划“感到意外”。
