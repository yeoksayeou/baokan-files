Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, July 15th: Representatives of tofu-making workers from twenty-one provinces and cities held an experience exchange meeting in Shanghai from July 9th to 15th, to study how to make more palatable tofu. Representatives of oil pressing workers from various regions also participated in the meeting, exchanging experiences in providing better raw materials—cold-pressed soybean flakes—for tofu workshops.

Tofu made in Shanghai's tofu workshops using cold-pressed soybean flakes, which have already been pressed for oil, is white in color, fine in texture, and tastes the same as that made from soybeans. They can also produce seventeen kinds of bean products such as bai ye (thousand-layer tofu), spiced dried tofu, tofu skin, and fried tofu. This experience was widely praised at the meeting. The representatives visited eighteen well-known tofu workshops in Shanghai, observed the workers' operations, and practiced making tofu on the spot.

The representatives from Zhejiang Province introduced their method of using wooden knocking machines and wooden bumping machines to cold-press soybeans, which also produces delicious tofu. Everyone believed that this experience is suitable for promotion in towns lacking mechanical oil pressing equipment.

The experience of Changsha Local State-Owned Sanxiang Oil Factory in using automatic screw oil presses to cold-press soybeans was also introduced at the meeting. Soybean flakes pressed using this method will not deteriorate within twenty days and do not need to be ground again when making tofu.

This meeting was jointly convened by the Ministry of Food, the Ministry of Commerce, and the Ministry of Food Industry. Li Guangjun, the host of the meeting, said that tofu is a major non-staple food for the Chinese people. In recent years, the promotion of using cold-pressed soybean flakes that have already been pressed for oil to make tofu has led to a decline in the quality of tofu in some areas. However, as long as the oil pressing and tofu making operations are improved, it is possible not only to increase oil production for the country but also to make good tofu.

    把豆腐做得更好吃
    二十一个省市的代表在上海交流经验
    新华社上海15日电　二十一个省、市的制豆腐工人的代表，七月九日到十五日在上海举行经验交流会议，研究怎样做出更可口的豆腐。各地榨油工人代表也参加了会议，交流了为豆腐作坊提供更好的原料——冷榨豆片的经验。
    上海的豆腐作坊用榨过油的冷榨豆片磨制的豆腐，色泽洁白，质地细嫩，同黄豆做的滋味一样。他们还能做出百页、香干、豆腐衣、油豆腐等十七种豆制品。这个经验在会上受到普遍赞赏。代表们参观了上海十八家著名的豆腐作坊，观摩了工人的操作，并且当场学习试做。
    浙江省的代表介绍了他们用木头敲车、木头撞车等工具冷榨大豆的办法，做出的豆腐同样好吃。大家认为这个经验适合在缺乏机器榨油设备的城镇里推广。
    长沙地方国营三湘油厂用自动螺旋榨油机冷榨大豆的经验，也在会上作了介绍。用这个方法榨出的豆片，二十天内不会变质，而且做豆腐的时候不要再磨。
    这次会议是粮食部、商业部和食品工业部联合召开的。会议的主持人李光军说，豆腐是我国人民的主要副食品，近年来推行用冷榨方法把榨过油的大豆片做豆腐，有些地方豆腐品质下降了。但只要改进榨油和制豆腐的操作方法，不但能为国家增产油脂，而且同样可以做出好豆腐。
