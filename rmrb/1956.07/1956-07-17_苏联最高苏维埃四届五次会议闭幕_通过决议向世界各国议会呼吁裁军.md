Moscow Dispatch from Our Newspaper, July 16th: The joint meeting of the Soviet Supreme Soviet of the Union and the Soviet of Nationalities decided today to transform the Karelo-Finnish Soviet Socialist Republic into the Karelian Soviet Socialist Autonomous Republic, and to incorporate it into the Russian Federation. When discussing this request from the Supreme Soviet of the Karelo-Finnish Republic, Kuusinen, Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of this Republic, provided an explanation. Kuusinen said that this was considered from the perspective of national composition and economic and cultural characteristics. Since its establishment in 1940, the Karelo-Finnish Republic has become more prosperous after sixteen years, but now the Karelian and other ethnic groups only account for a quarter of the national composition, while the Russian and other ethnic groups account for three-quarters. The Republic's economy is characterized by forestry and other industries, and its cultural ties with Russia are even closer. Tarasov, Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Russian Federation, spoke, representing the Russian Federation in welcoming this change. Representatives Fousse, Anchipov, Qiusiyamen, Kozlov, and others spoke in detail, all supporting the demands of the people of the Karelo-Finnish Republic. Finally, the joint meeting of the two chambers unanimously passed the law transforming the Karelo-Finnish Union Republic into the Karelian Autonomous Republic, and the two chambers also separately and unanimously passed the law incorporating the Karelian Autonomous Republic into the Russian Federation.

Thus, the Fifth Session of the Fourth Soviet Supreme Soviet concluded successfully at 3:30 PM on the sixteenth.
