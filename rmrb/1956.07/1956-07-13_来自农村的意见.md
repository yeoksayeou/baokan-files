    Larger Cooperatives Need Larger Threshing Grounds
    During the wheat harvest season, continuous rain caused many cut wheat stalks to sprout, turning into "bean sprouts." A lot of grain that was almost in our mouths was wasted. It really hurt to see.
    In the past, farmers harvested and threshed their wheat separately. Now, the wheat is threshed collectively by the cooperatives. However, the existing threshing grounds are too small, not to mention during rain, they are insufficient even on sunny days. Threshing takes over a month to complete each day. The wheat piles up, unable to be turned and dried, naturally leading to mold.
    I suggest that all agricultural production cooperatives expand their threshing grounds as much as possible. If the village really cannot find spacious threshing grounds, they can build some outside the village. Occupying some land is worth it. One can calculate whether the loss of grain due to small threshing grounds or the loss from occupying land is greater.
    It may be too late for the summer harvest, but I hope we can learn from this lesson and prepare the threshing grounds for the autumn harvest. (Ge Yinzhu)
    Fewer Meetings
    Currently, it is the busy farming season, but in Xinpu District, Jiaoling County, there are too many meetings, big and small, every day. For example, in Youkeng Township, from May 13th to 19th, the township held Party branch meetings, Communist Youth League branch meetings, and member representative meetings. The county and district held Party branch secretary meetings, Communist Youth League branch secretary meetings (to discuss literacy work), Forestry Committee meetings (CYL branch secretaries had to attend), public security officer meetings, water conservancy cadre meetings, childcare work meetings, Farmer's Daily correspondent meetings, agricultural cooperative accountant meetings, agricultural cooperative technician meetings, women's director meetings, Party branch propaganda officer meetings, and credit cooperative accountant meetings. Some of these meetings lasted all day, others for several days. Some township staff are busy attending all kinds of meetings all day long, unable to participate in production, and even after returning from meetings, they do not have time to convey the meeting content to the masses and arrange work.
    Let's have fewer meetings during the busy farming season! Too many meetings not only affect production but are also not beneficial to the work. (He Shao, Xiao Chuan)
    Requirements for Accounting Supervisors
    Currently, the financial management system for small cooperatives is not entirely suitable for large cooperatives. However, the cooperative's financial management, accounting system, and bookkeeping methods are not uniform across regions.
    Recently, the Zhejiang Provincial Department of Agriculture drafted a set of methods for handling large cooperative accounts. Shaoxing County modified it based on that, while Shangyu County has another set. Just the handouts for these management methods are making us confused.
    The account book categories are becoming more and more complicated, which is a heavy burden for farmer accountants. For example, the set of accounts drafted by the Zhejiang Provincial Department of Agriculture lists twenty-nine categories, while Shaoxing County's has thirty-one, with over a hundred detailed categories, and the detailed categories are further divided into many scopes and sub-items. It is said that establishing these categories is for "future economic accounting." As for what economic accounting is and how to implement it, no one understands. Originally, one person handled receipts and payments, but now it takes at least two people to cope. Yu Zhangmei, an accountant from Yuezhong Cooperative in Yucan Village, Yuexi Township, Shangyu County, reflected that the account book categories are becoming more and more complicated, the work is getting busier and busier, they are required to run the cooperative diligently and thriftily, and they cannot go to the fields to produce. He is very discouraged, so after learning the new accounts, he is not prepared to use them in the cooperative.
    I suggest that the central agricultural departments draft a simple financial accounting system suitable for the current cooperatives, stipulating a unified method for handling accounts. (Wan Tongsun)
    We Don't Have Cooperative Statutes Yet
    I am a demobilized soldier who returned to my hometown this March and now serve as the accountant of the Qinlao Agricultural Production Cooperative in Nanwu Village, Yuanshi County, Hebei. Our cooperative was formed at the beginning of this year by merging four elementary cooperatives. Until now, we have not formulated cooperative statutes, and we don't plan to formulate them at all. The director once said, "It's easier to handle things without cooperative statutes; it's harder with cooperative statutes." That is to say, he is afraid that having cooperative statutes will restrict the work and he won't be able to do whatever he wants. Currently, there are many cadres in the cooperative, the division of labor is unclear, and the management committee has never formally discussed the cooperative's work plan, not to mention annual or long-term plans, even seasonal or monthly plans, or even five-day plans are lacking. Many things are grasped haphazardly on a temporary basis; or whatever the higher authorities assign, we do whatever they tell us to do. Financial management is also chaotic, the labor quotas are not uniform, and the cooperative members are not motivated to work. I think that if this continues, it will be difficult to consolidate the cooperative. I hope the county leaders can help solve the above problems as soon as possible. (Wang Bingyin)

专栏：

    社大了需要大场院
    麦收季节，阴雨连绵，不少割下来的麦子出了麦芽，变成了“豆芽子”。已经吃到嘴边的粮食，糟踏了不少。看着真心疼。
    过去农民收了麦子分散收打，现在麦子都由合作社集中打，但是现有的场院都很小，不用说下雨，即使是晴天也不够用。每天打场，也得一个来月才能打完。麦子堆成大堆，不能翻晒，自然要霉坏了。
    我建议各个农业生产合作社，尽量把打粮食的场院扩大，如果村里实在找不到宽敞的场院，可在村外修几个。这样占点土地也是值得的。可以算算账看，因为场院小损坏的粮食和场院占用地的损失哪多哪少？
    现在夏收可能赶不上了，希望接受这次教训，准备好秋收打粮食的场院。　（葛银柱）
    少开些会
    目前正是农忙时节，可是蕉岭县新铺区各乡开会特别多，大会、小会天天都有。像油坑乡从五月十三日到十九日七天中，乡上召开了党支部会、团支部会、社员代表会；县、区开了党支部书记会、团支部书记会（讨论扫盲工作）、林业委员会（团支部书记要参加）、公安员会、水利干部会、托儿工作会、农民报通讯员会、农业社会计会、农业社技术员会、妇女主任会、党支部宣传员会、信用社会计会。这些会议有的开一整天，有的开好几天。乡里有些工作人员整天忙着开各式各样的会，根本无法参加生产，甚至开会回来后连向群众传达会议内容和布置工作的时间都没有。
    农忙季节少开些会吧！会开多了，既影响了生产，对工作也是没有好处的。　（何韶　筱传）
    会计辅导员的要求
    现在，小型社的财务管理制度，对大型社不完全适用了。可是社的财务管理、会计制度和记账方法，各地都很不统一。
    最近浙江省农业厅拟了一套处理大型社账的办法，绍兴县的在这个基础上变更了一下，上虞县的又另是一套。仅是这些管理办法的讲义，就使我们摸不着头脑。
      账薄科目愈来愈繁，对农民会计员也是一个很大的负担。像浙江省农业厅拟定的一套账，科目列二十九个，绍兴县的是三十一个，明细科目多至百余个，而明细科目下面还要分许多范围设置细目。据说设立这类科目是为了“将来实行经济核算”。至于什么叫经济核算，怎样实行，谁也不懂。原来收付账一个人做，现在起码要二个人才能应付。上虞县越南区两溪乡于坎村越众社的会计于张美反映：账簿科目愈变愈繁，工作愈来愈忙，又要勤俭办社，又不能下田生产，他非常泄气，因此他学习了新账回社后就不准备用。
    我建议中央农业部门拟订一套适合目前合作社使用的简便财务会计制度，规定账务的统一处理办法。
                        （万桐孙）
    我们还没有社章
    我是今年三月才还乡的复员转业军人，现任河北元氏县南吴村勤劳农业生产合作社的会计。我们的社是在今年年初由四个初级社合并成的。直到现在还没有订出社章，而且也根本不打算订社章了。主任曾说：“没有社章还好办，有了社章更难办。”也就是说怕有了社章对工作有了约束，不能随便想怎么干就怎么干了。目前，社里干部不少，分工不明，管委会从未正式讨论过社的工作计划，别说全年或远景规划，就是季节或月份甚至连五日的计划都没有。许多事情都是临时乱抓；或是上级布置什么作什么，怎样布置怎样作。财务管理也很乱，劳动定额不统一，社员干活不起劲。我看这样下去合作社是很难巩固的。希望县的领导上能及早帮助解决上述问题。　（王丙寅）
