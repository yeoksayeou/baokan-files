    Launch a Struggle for Drainage and Emergency Harvesting
    Jiangsu's Summer Harvest Increases Production
    (Our Dispatch) Jiangsu Province's summer harvest on over 50 million mu of land has concluded, with the total summer grain output increasing by nearly 300 million jin compared to the bumper year of 1955. Although this year's wheat suffered from diseases, waterlogging, and other natural disasters in the later stages of ripening, the broad masses actively adopted a combination of manual and chemical methods to prevent waterlogging and reduce the damage caused by wheat spider mites on several million mu of land. During the heavy rain before the wheat harvest, many agricultural cooperatives drained water and rushed to harvest, completely draining the accumulated water from 11 million mu of waterlogged fields across the province within three to five days. For example, Songjiang Prefecture rushed to harvest all of its more than 1.1 million mu of wheat in two days. Songjiang County also organized more than 19,000 elderly, weak, and children to glean wheat ears, reducing losses. Therefore, the total wheat output of the province is still more than 3.6 billion jin. The wheat in Songjiang, Suzhou, Nantong, Xuzhou, and other prefectures has either approached or exceeded the original production increase plan. Suzhou Prefecture's nearly 4.4 million mu of wheat averaged 160 jin per mu, an increase of 25% over last year, with a total output exceeding the plan by more than 100 million jin.

    开展排涝抢收的斗争
    江苏夏收增产
    本报讯　江苏省五千多万亩田的夏收已经结束，夏季粮食总产量比丰收的1955年增产将近三亿斤。今年的小麦虽然在成熟后期连遭病、涝等自然灾害的侵袭，但广大群众积极采用人工和药剂结合防涝的办法，减轻了数百万亩麦蜘蛛的为害；在麦收前的大雨中，许多农业社排涝抢收，全省一千一百万亩受涝田亩的积水在三、五天内全部排出。例如松江专区一百一十多万亩小麦在两天时间内就全部抢收结束。松江县还组织了老弱小孩一万九千多人拾麦穗，减少了抛损。因此全省小麦总产量仍为三十六亿多斤。松江、苏州、南通、徐州等专区的小麦，都接近或者超额完成原订增产计划，苏州专区近四百四十万亩小麦平均每亩收一百六十斤，比去年增产二成半，总产量超过计划一亿多斤。　（江苏站）
