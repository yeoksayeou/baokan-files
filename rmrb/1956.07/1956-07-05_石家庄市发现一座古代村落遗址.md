    An ancient village site has recently been discovered in Shijiazhuang.

    Construction workers, while excavating drainage ditches in the southeastern part of the city, discovered that in an area approximately 400-500 meters long from north to south and 200-300 meters wide from east to west, about one meter underground, was generally mixed with many broken bricks and tiles with rope patterns, and fragments of black, red, and grey pottery with various patterns.  Intermingled with these were many utensils used by ancient people in their lives and production, including a large iron plowshare (weighing 14 jin), a small iron plowshare, a broken iron adze, a small iron knife, a broken bronze mirror, and fragments of broken pottery urns.
