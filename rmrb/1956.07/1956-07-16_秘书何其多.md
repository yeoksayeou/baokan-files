    Too Many Secretaries
    I work at the Bureau of Surveying and Mapping under the Urban Construction Bureau. The phenomenon of overstaffing in our organization is very serious.
    Our bureau has six divisions and two sections. Each division and section has an average of only six or seven people, including the leaders. However, each division has one secretary, and the secretary section has five secretaries, totaling eleven secretaries. This accounts for 25% of the bureau's staff (not including the bureau director's secretary and the personnel section secretary).
    Those secretaries who are busier can complete all their work in an average of half a day. When they are free, these secretaries read newspapers and other books in the office, and the female comrades knit sweaters and make shoes.
    Based on the situation in our bureau, the secretarial work can be completely centralized (except for the personnel section). A secretarial section or office can be set up, and people can be assigned to be responsible for receiving and sending documents, keeping files, etc. In this way, five people would be enough.　Liu Yang

    秘书何其多
    我在城市建设总局勘察测量管理局工作。我们机关里人浮于事的现象很严重。
    我们这个局下面设六个处、两个科，每个处、科连领导同志在内平均不过六、七人，但是每个处都设秘书一人，秘书科设秘书五人，共有秘书十一人，占全局工作人员的25％（局长室秘书、人事科秘书还没有计算在内）。
    这些秘书工作较忙的平均每天用半天时间也就可以做完全部工作。闲下来的时候，这些秘书们就在办公室看报纸和其他书籍，女同志就织毛衣，做鞋子。
    根据我们局的情况看，秘书工作完全可以集中起来，（人事科除外），设一个秘书科或办公室，派人分别负责收发文件、保管文件等工作。这样五个人就够了。　刘　洋
