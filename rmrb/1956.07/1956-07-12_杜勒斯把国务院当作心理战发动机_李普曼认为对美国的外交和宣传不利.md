Xinhua News Agency, 10th dispatch from Washington: The "Washington Post" recently published an article by Lippmann which stated that Dulles has now "appointed himself as the chief of propaganda and is using loud and blustering publicity to turn the State Department into a psychological warfare engine." He said: "In the past, psychological warfare warriors, like intelligence agents, have always been separate from diplomatic affairs," but "Dulles has recently expanded his personal activities, undertaking propaganda and psychological warfare."

Lippmann said that for the U.S. Secretary of State "to become an active propagandist is a new task, and we believe that this is detrimental to both our diplomacy and our propaganda." Lippmann explicitly expressed doubt about the value of Dulles' current approach, believing that a "proper distinction" must be maintained between diplomacy and propaganda, "because the Secretary of State cannot handle being seen as a propagandist."

Lippmann particularly disagreed with the propaganda approach taken by Dulles towards the socialist camp's movement against the cult of personality. He said that this movement "is likely to be of epoch-making significance. In the face of this development, what attitude should the United States take? Should we, like anxious otters, call attention to ourselves, making it seem as if we are the driving force in this upheaval, and say or do something every day that implies American intervention? Should we believe, like a rooster, that the sun rises because it crows at dawn?" In Lippmann's view, the United States should avoid giving such an impression.

Lippmann concluded: "Now is the time for the cunning American psychological warfare warriors to retire. A clever Secretary of State should stay out of matters that he cannot control and dominate, rather than interfere in them."

    杜勒斯把国务院当作心理战发动机
    李普曼认为对美国的外交和宣传不利
    新华社10日讯　华盛顿消息：“华盛顿邮报”最近刊载的李普曼的一篇文章中说，杜勒斯目前已经“自任为宣传首脑，并且用虚张声势的大肆宣传把国务院当作一个心理战的发动机”。他说：“在过去，心理战的战士们，像情报局的间谍一样，一直是和外交事务分开的”，但是“杜勒斯最近却扩大了他个人的活动，承揽了宣传和心理战”。
    李普曼说，美国国务卿“要成为一个积极的宣传家是一个新的任务，而我们认为，这对于我们的外交和我们的宣传说来都是不利的”。李普曼对杜勒斯目前的做法的价值明白表示怀疑，他认为必须在外交和宣传之间保持“适当的区别”，“因为把国务卿看作是一个宣传家，他是吃不消的”。
    李普曼特别不同意杜勒斯对社会主义阵营反对个人崇拜的运动所采取的宣传方针。他说，这个运动“很可能具有划时代的意义。在这种发展的面前，美国应该采取什么态度呢？我们难道应该像焦急的海獭一样叫人注意我们自己，使得我们好像是这个剧变中的原动力，并且每一天都说一些或者作一些意味着美国干涉的事情吗？难道我们要像公鸡那样相信太阳的升起是因为它在黎明时啼叫吗？”在李普曼看来，美国应该避免给人造成这种印象。
    李普曼最后说：“现在是狡猾的美国心理战战士退隐的时候了。一个聪明的国务卿对于他不能控制和支配的事应该置身事外，而不是干预其事。”
