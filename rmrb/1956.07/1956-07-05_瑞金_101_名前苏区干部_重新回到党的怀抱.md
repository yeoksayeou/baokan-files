101 Former Soviet Area Cadres in Ruijin
Rejoin the Party

    (Reported by this newspaper) 101 former Soviet area cadres in Ruijin County, during the Second Revolutionary Civil War, have gloriously rejoined the Communist Party of China.
    During the Second Revolutionary Civil War, these comrades made certain contributions to the revolutionary work under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and thus gloriously joined the Communist Party of China. After the Red Army marched north to resist Japan, for the needs of revolutionary work, they obeyed the assignment of the Party organization and were left behind to continue to do Party work and fight against the enemy. In extremely difficult circumstances, they lost contact with the Party.
    After the liberation of Ruijin, they returned to the revolutionary ranks, actively participated in various movements led by the Party, and made many achievements. Currently, among the 101 Party members who have been readmitted to the Party, four have served as members of the Ruijin County Party Committee, and the rest have participated in leadership work at the district or township level.

    瑞金101名前苏区干部
    重新回到党的怀抱
    本报讯　第二次国内革命战争时期，瑞金县有101名前苏区干部光荣地参加了中国共产党，重新回到党的怀抱。
    这些同志在第二次国内革命战争时期，在党中央和毛主席领导下，在革命工作中有一定的贡献，因而光荣地参加了中国共产党。红军北上抗日后，为了革命工作的需要，他们服从了党组织的分配，被留下来继续坚持做党的工作，同敌人进行斗争。在极端艰苦的环境里，他们和党失去了联系。
    瑞金解放后，他们重新回到了革命队伍，积极地参加了党所领导的各项运动，做出了很多成绩。目前重新吸收入党的101名党员中，已有四名担任了中共瑞金县委委员，其余都参加了区或乡级的领导工作。
