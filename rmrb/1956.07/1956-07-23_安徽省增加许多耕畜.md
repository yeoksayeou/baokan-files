Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, 21st - The number of draft animals raised by farmers in Anhui Province has reached more than 3.42 million, an increase of more than 700,000 compared to last year. The average amount of cultivated land burdened by each draft animal has decreased from 36 mu last year to 27 mu.
	During the high tide of cooperativization last autumn, the Anhui Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party called on cooperatives to achieve "three increases" (increased grain and cotton production, increased pig production, and increased draft animal production). Since then, cooperatives in various regions have actively bred and protected female and young animals and improved breeding management methods. More than 30,000 breeders have been trained for cooperatives throughout the province.
	During this period, the state has successively issued loans of 2.51 million yuan to support farmers in raising draft animals.

    安徽省增加许多耕畜
    新华社合肥21日电　安徽省农民饲养的耕畜已达三百四十二万多头，比去年增加七十多万头。现在，平均每头耕畜负担的耕地，已从去年的三十六亩减低到二十七亩。
    在去年秋季合作化高潮中，中共安徽省委号召合作社要做到“三增产”（粮棉、生猪和耕畜增产）以后，各地合作社都积极繁殖和保护母畜、幼畜，并改进饲养管理方法，仅全省为合作社训练的饲养员就有三万多人。
    这一期间，国家先后发放了二百五十一万元贷款，支援农民饲养耕畜。
