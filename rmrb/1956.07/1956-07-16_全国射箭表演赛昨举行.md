    National Archery Demonstration Competition Held Yesterday

    (Our newspaper dispatch) The first national archery demonstration competition was held yesterday at the Temple of Agriculture Sports Ground in Beijing. Qinghai Province athlete Cuo Shiji won the women's group championship with a total score of 31 rings. The following places were taken by Tong Peiyun from Shanghai, Li Chaogema from Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, Cai Ren from Qinghai Province, Luan Xiuyun from Beijing, and Hai Shuxiu from Henan Province. Four herdsmen from Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, Buhe Aoqier, Aomulaxi, Li Cheng, and Mari Se, defeated all their opponents and took the top four places in the men's group. Buhe Aoqier's total score was 143 rings.

    Thirty-seven athletes from provinces and cities including Beijing, Shanghai, Hebei, Henan, Shandong, Qinghai, and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region participated in this demonstration competition, including Han, Manchu, Mongolian, Hui, and Tibetan nationalities. Among the athletes were workers, farmers, herdsmen, teachers, students, doctors, handicraftsmen, and so on. Shanghai athlete Ma Baochen is already a 71-year-old veteran, and Li Chaogema, who finished fourth in the women's group, is a 16-year-old first-year junior high school student.

    The person in charge of the organizing committee told reporters that archery is one of China's traditional folk sports. In ancient times, there were many "hundred-step piercing willow" master archers. Now herdsmen in Qinghai, Inner Mongolia and other places still like to use bows and arrows for hunting, and there are archery competitions at every Nadaam festival. This competition is for foot archery. The men's group is divided into 20, 30, and 40 meters accuracy shooting, and the women's group is divided into 20 and 30 meters accuracy shooting. Each person shoots ten arrows at each distance, and the target is divided into ten rings.
