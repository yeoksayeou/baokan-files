    The First Lesson
    Lin Ye
    After dinner, I invited Teacher Zhang for a walk. Old Zhang said:
    "I'm not going. I have to prepare more for class tomorrow."
    I wanted to persuade him, "You've already prepared enough. Preparing more won't make much difference; it might just leave you tired tomorrow." But after glancing at him, I held back the words. No wonder! It was his first time as a teacher, his first time preparing a lesson! Didn't I have the same experience before? Before teaching my first lesson, hadn't I flipped through the textbook dozens of times?
    I returned to my room after the walk and saw Teacher Zhang sitting at his desk, hands on his cheeks, lost in thought. The desk was covered with books, notebooks, blank paper… I was afraid to disturb him, so I quietly took a novel from the bookshelf and lay down to read. But he suddenly turned around and saw me, immediately asking me questions about teaching. The questions became more and more detailed, to the point where I could hardly answer them. Finally, my eyes were so tired I could barely keep them open. I vaguely heard him still asking me something, and I mumbled in response, falling asleep without realizing it. When I woke up, Teacher Zhang was full of energy, still preparing the lesson. Looking at the clock, it was already twelve. I urged him to go to sleep, and he said, "I'll just look through it one more time and then I'll sleep."
    I turned over and fell asleep again. When I woke up again, the room was dark. I needed to go to the toilet, but I was afraid of waking Teacher Zhang, so I didn't turn on the light and quietly felt my way out of the room. Suddenly, I saw a faint light coming from the classroom. What was going on? I went over and quietly peeked in through the window. It was still Teacher Zhang. He was standing on the podium, facing rows of dark desks, concentrating intently and lecturing in a low voice, occasionally writing a few words on the blackboard. A faint light was coming from a flashlight on the desk.
    I didn't call him. The sky was full of stars at this time, and the night was already deep.
    I returned to my room, tossing and turning, unable to sleep. "One, two, three, four..." I counted silently, planning to count to three hundred, and if he wasn't back by then, I would definitely go and drag him back to bed. Before I even reached that number, he gently pushed open the door and came in, quietly lying down in the darkness. Soon, I heard his even, light snoring. But I couldn't fall asleep for a long time.
    The next day when I got up, Teacher Zhang was already gone. After class, the principal asked me to find out the students' reaction to Teacher Zhang's lesson. The students told me that the new teacher explained things very clearly and well, but seemed a bit nervous.
    I went to find Teacher Zhang excitedly, and shook his hand tightly, saying:
    "Congratulations, the lesson was very successful!"
    He widened his eyes and, after listening to my report of the students' feedback, heaved a long sigh of relief, as if a great weight had been lifted:
    "This first lesson is finally over."

    第一课
    林夜
    吃罢晚饭，我邀张老师去散步。老张说：
    “不去了，明天上课，我得再准备准备。”
    我想劝说他：“早都准备好了，再准备也不过这样，反倒弄得明天没精神。”但我看了他一眼，话到口边就留住了。难怪呀！他是第一次做教员，第一次备课呢！我自己从前不也有过这经历吗？在上第一课以前，何止几十次去翻课本呢？
    我散步回房，看见张老师坐在书桌前，两手托腮，正在凝神地想着什么。书桌上摆满了书、笔记本、白纸……。我怕扰乱他，轻轻地从书架上抽了一本小说，躺到床上看起来。但他猛回头发现了我，立刻就问起教课中的问题来。问题越问越细，弄得我几乎答不上来。最后我的眼睛实在睁不开了，朦胧中还听见他问我什么，我含含糊糊地应着，不知不觉睡着了。一觉醒来，张老师精神抖擞，还在那里备课，看看表已经十二点了。我催他睡觉，他说：“我再看一遍就睡。”
    我翻个身，又睡着了。再醒来时，屋里黑了。我想到厕所去一趟，怕惊醒张老师，没敢开灯，轻轻地摸出了房间。忽然，我看见从教室里透出来一道微弱的亮光。这是怎么回事？我走过去悄悄伏在窗口往里看，原来还是张老师。他站在讲台上，面对黑洞洞的一排排桌椅正聚精会神地在小声讲课，还不时在黑板上写几个字。一丝微弱的亮光，是从讲桌上一个手电筒里发出来的。
    我没有叫他。这时天上繁星密布，夜已经深了。
    我回到房里，翻来复去睡不着。“一、二、三、四、……”，我默数着，打算数到三百，他再不回来，我就一定去拉他回来睡觉。还没数到，他已轻轻地推门进来了，在黑暗中轻轻地睡下了。不一会儿，就听见他匀称轻微的鼾声。而我，却久久不能入睡。
    第二天我起床时，张老师已经不在房里了。下课以后，校长叫我去了解一下对张老师讲课的反应。同学们告诉我，新老师讲得很清楚，很好，只是好像有些拘束。
    我兴冲冲地去找张老师，紧紧地握住他的手说：
    “恭喜你，课讲得很成功！”
    他瞪圆了眼睛，听我说完同学们的反映，长呼了一口气，好像放下了千斤重担：
    “这第一课总算过去了。”
