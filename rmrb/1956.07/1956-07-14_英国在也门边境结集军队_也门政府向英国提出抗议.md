Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, July 13th: Yemen's Chargé d'Affaires in Egypt, Ahmed Shami, said yesterday that Britain is assembling troops in the eastern border area of Yemen. Approximately two hundred troops, commanded by the British, have surrounded the checkpoint area in eastern Yemen.

The Chargé d'Affaires stated that the Yemeni government considers this an act of aggression and has instructed the Yemeni Minister to Britain, Hassani Ibrahim, to immediately travel to London to protest to the British government.

On June 10th, Yemeni Minister of State and Deputy Foreign Minister Al-Amari issued a statement pointing out that the so-called Eastern and Western Aden Protectorates under British rule are part of Yemeni territory. He demanded that Britain abandon these territories and allow the people to build their lives according to their own wishes. The statement also expressed the hope that disputes with Britain could be resolved peacefully.

Shami said that the news of the British troop assembly has been notified to the joint command of Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and Yemen, located in Cairo.

These three countries have signed a tripartite defense agreement, which stipulates that if any of the three countries is subjected to aggression, they will provide mutual assistance.

    英国在也门边境结集军队
    也门政府向英国提出抗议
    据新华社13日讯　开罗消息：也门驻埃及大使馆代办艾哈迈德·沙米昨天说，英国正在也门东部边界地带集结军队。大约有二百名由英国人指挥的部队包围了也门东部的关卡地区。
    这位代办说，也门政府认为这是一种侵略行动，并且已经指令也门驻英公使哈萨尼·易卜拉欣立即前往伦敦向英国政府提出抗议。
    也门国务大臣兼外交副大臣艾马里在六月十日曾经发表一项声明，指出英国统治下的所谓亚丁东部和西部保护地是也门领土的一部分，并且要求英国放弃这些土地，让人民按照自己的愿望来建设自己的生活。这个声明还表示希望能够和平解决同英国的纠纷。
    沙米说，英国集结军队的消息已经通知了设在开罗的埃及、沙特阿拉伯、也门联合司令部。
    这三个国家曾经签订了一个三边防御协定，这个协定规定三国中任何一国受到侵略时要互相援助。
