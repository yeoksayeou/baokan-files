    Erratic Instructions Delay Important Matters
    During this period in Hunan Province, supply and marketing cooperatives received dozens of letters and telegrams daily, all from various locations requesting the allocation of sprayers. However, the supply and marketing cooperatives had no stock and were unable to supply them. Some areas are already experiencing pest infestations. The Chenxian Prefectural Office has discovered locusts and leaf rollers on more than 50,000 mu of rice paddies. The Dongfanghong Agricultural Cooperative in Shaodong County bought 3,000 jin of wettable 666 but couldn't buy sprayers. Farmers in Tiaoshi Township, Xinning County, unable to buy sprayers, told the supply and marketing cooperative cadres: "If production is reduced in the future, we will settle accounts with you."
    Why are sprayers out of stock? When Hunan Province drafted the 1956 national economic plan last year, the original plan was for local industrial departments in Hunan Province to produce 75,000 sprayers, and the necessary raw materials and accessories were also prepared. Later, the Central Handicraft Administration proposed that production be unified under the handicraft system and directly allocated 235,000 units to the Hunan Provincial Handicraft Administration for production, so the task of local industrial production of sprayers was cancelled. In February, the Hunan Provincial Handicraft Administration arranged production and ordered a batch of rubber tubes and rubber gaskets from Shanghai. At this time, the Central Handicraft Administration sent a telegram: "Such materials will be supplied directly by the Central Government." The Provincial Handicraft Administration had no choice but to apply for cancellation of the contract and wait for the Central Government to allocate the materials. However, even by April, the rubber tubes supplied by the Central Handicraft Administration had not yet arrived. Our province, due to the urgency of the rural season, urged the immediate supply. But the reply received was: it cannot be supplied. This is really embarrassing. The originally ordered goods were returned, and the supplied goods were not given, resulting in falling through on both sides. To remedy this situation, the Hunan Provincial Planning Commission convened an emergency meeting and was forced to decide to stop the production of rubber shoes in the province and immediately convert to the production of rubber tubes. However, just as this task was being deployed, a telephone call was received from the Central Handicraft Administration: "Rubber tubes and rubber gaskets can be resolved, and a batch will be shipped in May." Who knew that May had passed, and the rubber tubes promised to be allocated by the Central Handicraft Administration had still not arrived, and the province's plan to convert rubber shoe factories to produce rubber tubes had also failed.
    Due to the erratic instructions of the Central Handicraft Administration, our province is currently unable to solve the problem of the spread of insect pests. It is hoped that the relevant departments of the Central Government will investigate and deal with this matter and immediately solve the supply problem of sprayers in our province. (Yu Guoqing)

### 反复无常的指示耽误大事

    反复无常的指示耽误大事
    湖南省这一时期，供销社每天接到几十封函电，都是各地要求拨给喷雾器的。但是供销社没有货，无法供应。现在有些地方已经发生虫害、郴县专署有五万多亩稻田发现了蝗虫和纵卷叶虫，邵东县东方红农业社买了三千斤可湿性六六六，但是买不到喷雾器。新宁县跳石乡的农民买不到喷雾器，对供销社的干部说：“将来减了产要和你们算账”。
    喷雾器为什么脱销？去年湖南省编制1956年国民经济计划草案的时候，原计划湖南省地方工业部门生产喷雾器75，000架，所需用的原材料和配件也作了准备。后来中央手工业管理局提出统一交由手工业系统生产，并且直接分配给湖南省手工业管理局生产23.5万架，因此地方工业生产喷雾器的任务就取消了。二月份，湖南省手工业管理局安排生产，向上海订购了一批橡胶管和胶垫圈。这个时候，中央手工业管理局发来电报：“此类物资概由中央直接供应。”省手工业管理局只好申请毁约，专等中央调拨材料。可是一直等到四月，中央手工业管理局供应的橡胶管还没有运来，我省因为农村季节紧迫，即催请火速供应。但得到的答复是：不能供应了。这真叫人为难，原来订购的货退了，供应的又不给了，落得两头扑空。为了补救这项工作，湖南省计划委员会召开了紧急会议，被迫决定停止省内胶鞋生产，马上改制橡胶管。但是，当这项任务刚刚布置下去，又接到中央手工业管理局的电话：“橡胶管和胶垫圈，可以设法解决，并在五月份运到一批。”谁知五月份已过，中央手工业管理局答应调拨的橡胶管，仍然没有运来一根，而省里打算由胶鞋厂改制橡胶管的计划，又落了空。
    由于中央手工业管理局反复无常的指示，害得我省目前眼看虫害的漫延，无法解决。希望中央有关部门检查处理这件事，立即解决我省喷雾器的供应问题。（余国清）
