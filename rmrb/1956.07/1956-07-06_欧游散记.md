　　Rambling Notes from a European Tour

　　The towering iron tower, entirely a large steel structure, allows you to ascend in a cable car to the highest level near the tip, from which you can overlook the entire city of Paris. Next to it, on Chaillot Hill, is the famous Palais de Chaillot. This building was constructed in 1878 for an exhibition and renovated in 1937. Now, part of it is the Museum of Mankind, and the basement houses the famous Grand Theatre, where the Théâtre National Populaire (National People's Theatre) frequently performs. This area is indeed very scenic. From the iron tower, the Palais de Chaillot, with its white colonnades, looks like a pair of strong arms embracing a beautiful square. It should be said that these buildings demonstrate the spirit with which the French Republic, during its heyday, constructed its capital. The iron tower, a steel giant, is said to have been initiated and built by an engineer named Eiffel. It cannot be called beautiful, but it is powerful.

　　In this beautifully structured area, there is now one more building: the American-style NATO office. Many Parisians shake their heads as soon as they see this building, which disrupts the beautiful composition of the entire area. Indeed, this matchbox-like high-rise is too dissonant with the Palais de Chaillot, which also has a modern style. This is because the matchbox-like high-rise lacks the imposing and graceful demeanor of the Palais de Chaillot in its exterior. Therefore, when the American troops had not yet withdrawn from Paris after the war, and the French were shouting "Yanks go home" everywhere, it is said that this matchbox-like high-rise also became a target for the masses to vent their righteous indignation, with small stones flying from nowhere often shattering the glass of doors and windows. Therefore, even now, some of the doors and windows of this building are still fitted with glass that has wire mesh embedded in the gaps.

　　Versailles and Fontainebleau are famous palaces in the suburbs of Paris. The former is not only famous as the site where the European war treaties were signed, but also because its marble architecture and magnificent gardens demonstrate the French people's outstanding contribution to architectural art. The Palace of Fontainebleau, on the other hand, is linked to the anecdotes of Napoleon. It is therefore also a good place to attract foreign tourists.

　　The Palace of Versailles has a good collection of paintings, and the oil paintings on the ceilings are especially admired by enthusiasts. However, some palaces have not been repaired for many years, and the murals are particularly prone to peeling and discoloration. The museum guides said, "Although the government has allocated funds to start repairs, the limited budget means that it is not possible to start work on all the places that need repair at the same time." Therefore, when the Chinese Art Troupe was performing in Paris, some French friends suggested that, in order to meet the needs of more Parisians, the Chinese Art Troupe could perform once in the square of the Palace of Versailles, so that nearly 100,000 people could come to see the performance on the marble steps. This would be a grand festival. And all the income, the Chinese artists were willing to donate to the Versailles Palace Museum for repairs. Although this plan was supported by many relevant parties and agreed to by the Paris authorities, it was unfortunately not possible to realize it due to the fixed performance schedule of the Chinese Art Troupe in other countries.

　　When we went to Fontainebleau, it was raining, and the nearby forest was truly beautiful. But in the forest, many places were cut down into bald patches. Parisians are so proud of their forests, and believe that it is the greatest blessing for Parisians to be able to keep such good forests near the city center. Therefore, we were very surprised that these forests were being cut down in patches. When we asked a walking person, this elderly gentleman replied with disdain, "Humph, isn't it done by the Yanks!" It turned out that the American garrison stationed after the war cut down these trees to build barracks. Our car turned to another place, and we saw rows of American-style apartment houses, and the driver also angrily told us, "These houses are still inhabited by the families of some American officers, they really know how to choose a good place to enjoy themselves."

    欧游散记
    赵风
    〔四〕
    高耸入云的铁塔，全部是一个钢铁的大结构，乘电缆车爬到将近尖端的最高一层，可以俯瞰巴黎全景。在它旁边，是夏乐山畔著名的夏乐宫。这个建筑物是1878年为展览会而修建的，1937年重修过。现在，一部分是人类博物馆，地下室部分是著名的大剧场，法兰西人民剧院便经常在这里演出。这一带的确是风景很美的地方。从铁塔上看夏乐宫，白色的柱廊像是一双有力的巨擘环抱着一个美丽的广场。应该说，这些建筑表现了法兰西共和国全盛时期在建设自己的首都上所表现的气魄。那钢铁的巨人似的铁塔，据说是一个工程师爱菲尔所倡议和修建的。它不能说是美丽的，但是是有力的。
    就在这个构图很美丽的地区，现在多了一个建筑物，那便是美国式的大西洋公约国办事处。许多巴黎人一看见这破坏了整个地区美丽构图的建筑物便摇头不已。的确，这个火柴盒式的高楼和虽然也具有现代风格的夏乐宫显得太不调和了。因为，火柴盒式的高楼缺少了像夏乐宫那样在外形上雄厚而又婀娜多姿的风度。所以，当战后美国军队还没有从巴黎撤退，法国人到处喊“美国佬回家去”的时候，据说这座火柴盒式的高楼也成了群众发泄义愤的对象，天外飞来的小石头常会把门窗的玻璃打得粉碎。所以，直到现在，这座房子的有些门窗，还装着那种夹缝中附有铁丝网的玻璃呢。
    凡尔赛和枫丹白露宫。是巴黎近郊的著名宫殿，前者不仅以欧战的和约签订地而著名，更因为它那大理石的建筑、雄伟的庭园的确表现了法国人民在建筑艺术上的杰出贡献。枫丹白露宫则和拿破仑的遗事连在一起。因而也是吸引外国游客的好地方。
    凡尔赛宫有着很好的绘画收藏，特别是天花板上的油画更为爱好者所叹赏。但有些宫殿年久失修，特别是壁画更易剥落变色。博物馆的向导人员说：“政府虽然拨款着手修理了，但是限于经费数字不能把应该修理的地方同时着手进行。”所以，当中国艺术团在巴黎演出的时候，有些法国朋友建议，为了满足巴黎更多的市民的要求，中国艺术团可以在凡尔赛宫的广场上演出一次，那么，将近十万人可以在大理石的台阶上来看到演出。这必将是一个盛大的节日。而全部收入，中国艺术家愿意捐给凡尔赛宫博物馆作为修缮费用。这个计划虽然得到许多有关方面的赞助以及巴黎官方的同意，但可惜由于中国艺术团在其他国家演出的期限已定，限于时间而没有能够实现。
    我们到枫丹白露去的时候，天正下雨，附近的森林真是美丽极了。但在森林里，许多地方被砍得光秃秃的一片。巴黎人是那么以他们的森林为骄傲，并且认为在闹市附近而能保有这么好的森林是巴黎人最大的福气。所以，这些森林被成片的砍掉便很使我们惊异。当我们问起一位散步的人，这位老年的绅士鄙夷地答道：“哼，还不是美国佬干的！”原来是战后的美国驻军砍掉这些树来盖营房。我们的汽车又转过一处，便看见了成排的美国式公寓房子，司机也生气地告诉我们说：“这些房子现在还住着些美国军官的家属，他们倒真会选好地方享福呢。”（附图片）
