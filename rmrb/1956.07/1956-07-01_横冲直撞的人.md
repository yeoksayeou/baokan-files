    A Person Who Charges Around Recklessly
    Around 11:00 AM on June 1st, Li Yulin, a security police officer at the Tianjin State-Owned Commercial Storage Company's warehouse, was on duty at the entrance when a tricycle arrived. A person resembling a "cadre" got off the vehicle and rushed headlong into the warehouse. Only after repeated questioning by Li Yulin did it come to light that he was Comrade Zhang Maocai from the Beijing Department Store, who had come to "handle business." Since he was there for business, he should have had a letter of introduction or a work ID, but the answer Li Yulin received was "no." Therefore, Li Yulin, following regulations, suggested that he should contact the warehouse beforehand. Unexpectedly, this suggestion offended the dignity of the "uninvited guest," provoking him to burst into a thunderous rage.
    Since Zhang Maocai is a state organ cadre who frequently "handles business," he should understand the principle of "warehouse restricted area, unauthorized personnel not allowed." Why did he insist on charging in without carrying any identification documents or agreeing to make contact beforehand?

    横冲直撞的人
    六月一日上午十一点钟光景，天津市国营商业仓储公司仓库的值岗警察李玉林正在门口值勤，忽然一辆三轮车来到了门口，从车上下来了一个“干部”模样的人，闷着头就往仓库里闯。经过李玉林的一再问讯，才知道他是北京市百货公司来“办业务”的张茂财同志。既然是来办业务的，当然应该有证明信件或工作证，但是李玉林得到的答复是“没有”。于是李玉林就按照规定提出应该事先和仓库联系一下的意见，不料，这个意见竟冒犯了“不速之客”的尊严，惹得他雷霆大作起来。
    张茂财既然是经常“办业务”的国家机关干部，应该懂得“仓库重地，闲人免进”的道理，为什么既不携带任何证明文件，又不同意取得联系然后进去，硬要横冲直撞呢？
