Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, July 19th: In the recent work of organizing local rice varieties, various counties in Guangdong Province have cultivated a large number of technicians for agricultural cooperatives to breed fine rice varieties. Currently, agricultural cooperatives in various places are selecting appropriate locations in the late-season rice fields as seed farms. More than 800,000 mu of such seed farms will be established throughout the province. In these seed farms, the single-plant close-planting method will be used to plant strong seedlings cultivated from superior varieties in order to breed the fine late-season rice varieties needed for next year.

The Guangdong Province's fine rice variety breeding system was established this year. More than 700,000 mu of fine varieties have already been cultivated for early-season rice this year. In the future, the work of breeding fine varieties will be carried out every year. State-owned farms, demonstration breeding farms, and fine variety breeding areas established by various counties throughout the province will become bases for breeding and promoting fine rice varieties.

    广东农业社建立留种田
    新华社广州19日电　广东省各县在最近结合整理地方水稻品种的工作中，已经给农业社培养出大批繁育水稻良种的技术员。目前，各地农业社正在晚造稻田里选择适当的地方作为留种田，这种留种田，全省将设置八十多万亩。在这些留种田里，将用单株密植的方法，插栽用优良品种育成的壮秧，以便繁育明年需用的晚稻良种。
    广东省水稻良种繁育制度是今年开始建立的。今年早造水稻已经培育了七十多万亩良种。今后，每年都将进行繁育良种的工作。全省的国营农场、示范繁殖场和各县设立的良种繁殖区，将成为繁育推广水稻良种的基地。
