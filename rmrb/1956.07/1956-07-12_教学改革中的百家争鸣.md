A Hundred Schools of Thought Contend in Teaching Reform
Lou Chenghou

Since liberation, in the process of teaching reform in higher education institutions, the Ministry of Higher Education has frequently convened teaching staff from relevant universities and colleges across the country to discuss and formulate teaching plans for various majors and teaching syllabi for various courses. In this work, based first on the needs of our country's construction, the establishment of majors and the goals of cultivating professional talents are discussed. Subsequently, teaching plans are formulated, and the items, order, teaching, and internship hours of courses are arranged to achieve these goals. For each course, its content is selected based on its task in the teaching plan and its relationship with relevant courses, and teaching and internship syllabi are formulated. In early attempts, it was only with the help of Soviet experts and by using relevant Soviet materials as blueprints that this complex system could be established in a short period of time. With this common understanding and system, higher education could guarantee the combination of theory and practice, define standards for cultivating talent, and universally improve the level of teaching. All of this is far from comparable to the aimless old education system before liberation.

However, in teaching, the implementation of these plans is not without difficulties and shortcomings. Due to the large number of new courses, the lack of teaching materials and teachers, the uneven levels of students, the frequency of social movements, and the multiple changes in rules and regulations, the teaching results and the talents cultivated are not as satisfactory as expected. The most prominent shortcoming is that in solving practical problems, they often show that they are bound by some fixed dogmas, their work tends to be general and rough, their basic operations are not skilled enough, and the methods they can use are limited. Upon careful investigation, this is related to our lack of experience in formulating teaching plans for the first time, learning from the Soviet Union in a relatively rigid manner, and failing to conform to the current actual situation in our country. Especially now, when marching towards science in the spirit of "a hundred schools of thought contend," it is even more necessary to examine whether, in our teaching reform, we have regarded our achievements as satisfactory, adhered to "one school of thought," and thus deviated from reality and become narrow-minded.

Take the plant physiology teaching syllabus formulated by Soviet higher agricultural colleges after the August 1948 Biological Science Conference and the new Soviet 1954 teaching syllabus that we recently used as a reference for revising our syllabus. Although their guiding spirit is consistent, it is not difficult to see that there are many differences between the two. When teaching based on the old syllabus as a blueprint, we encountered some difficulties in the specific explanations of some items and could only use the Soviet textbooks translated at the time as a basis. Now it seems that some arguments were not mature enough, some criticisms were not fair enough, and it was not appropriate to list them unilaterally in the teaching materials. Taking only the chapter on development, the irreversibility of vernalization treatment of wheat contradicted experimental reports in international literature at the time; the statement that plants require constant light or constant darkness during the light stage is fundamentally contradictory to the unity of biology and the environment and the alternation of day and night light and darkness in nature. The reasons for the degradation of potatoes are not only due to high temperatures, and are still being debated; the statement that malignant weeds in the field are caused by crop degradation has recently been openly criticized in the Soviet Union. It is hard to say that these unacknowledged "one-sided views" could have been included in teaching materials at one time without being influenced by the idea of "I am the only one who is right." In the new Soviet syllabus, some items that are still being tested have been deleted.

In the early days of liberation, we only heard some criticisms of Liebig's theory of plant mineral nutrition, and we severely refuted his mechanical materialist viewpoint, while at the same time proposing the slogan that soil fertility and yield per unit area could be increased infinitely. This approach easily led to some unrealistic and blindly optimistic sentiments among beginners, and did not help those familiar with Liebig's contributions much. Soviet soil science experts who lectured in our country a few years ago did not do this. He patiently and meticulously expounded the history of the development of soil science, and cited Liebig's outstanding contributions: According to the scientific achievements and field experiments at the time, Liebig overthrew the prevailing but incorrect "humus" theory of soil fertility, theoretically proved that plant soil nutrition mainly lies in minerals, and practically laid the foundation for the huge chemical fertilizer industry. As Marx said, agricultural products come from the field and are consumed in the city, and the soil fertility is therefore rapidly depleted, and it is indeed necessary to return the nutritional minerals to the land, so his law of return is timely. After affirming the merits of this founder of agricultural chemistry, the Soviet expert correctly criticized Liebig for being blinded by his great discoveries, stubbornly adhering to his views, regarding the soil as a passive container for nutritional minerals, and failing to recognize that the soil is a developing natural body. Liebig's erroneous ideas led the development of this science to a dead end, and made his work in his later years hit walls everywhere. How can such a comprehensive description of the strengths and weaknesses of a school of thought from the developmental point of view of dialectical materialism not be convincing and enlightening?

When criticizing the reactionary essence of American and European genetics, we pointed out that the statement that germplasm exists outside the body in organisms is metaphysical, and we pointed out that it is also the same mistake as the one-sided idea of "I am the only one who is right" to emphasize the heredity of chromosomes without separating it from the entire life of the organism. This local separation from the whole is still exposed in American and European theories from time to time, and this trend has been maintained and utilized by the bourgeois rulers in order to maintain their own interests. However, American and European science is also developed based on actual observation and experimentation, and is not stagnant. Modern American and European geneticists do not all believe that nuclear material is immutable, and have made many new discoveries about the heredity of cell organelles (nucleus, plastids, mitochondria, etc.) and cytoplasm, and their interrelationships, and have made great progress in the study of their biochemical mechanisms.

However, in our teaching work, although we emphasize in biochemistry that protein is the main component of living matter, in biology courses, we regard nuclear material (especially chromosomes) as a "taboo," avoid talking about it, or when talking about the material basis of heredity, we tend to treat the internal structure of cells as equal and without distinction between primary and secondary, and even sometimes, some phenomena recognized by the scientific community in chromosomes, such as the relationship between meiosis and alternation of generations, are ignored. No wonder students who have never heard of chromosomes can only swallow it whole when they hear criticisms of chromosome theory, and become inexplicably vigilant when they hear that someone is studying chromosomes. These "taboos" are not without reason. If we neglect a certain aspect in teaching, we will suffer corresponding losses in practice. Precisely because we overemphasize in genetics that species formation is a certain variation caused by adaptation to changes in living conditions, and ignore that changes in the structure of nuclear material itself can also cause beneficial changes in organisms, we have practically blocked some rapid and effective breeding methods using physical and chemical factors.

Individual scientific observations and experiments are small, fragmented, and limited by the background of the times compared to the endless changes in nature. Therefore, the outstanding discoveries of some scientists in an era are only a step forward in some aspects of the long stream of absolute truth. It has a positive effect to make appropriate evaluations of it with modern knowledge, but as mentioned above, making exaggerated theoretical generalizations without sufficient factual basis and then guiding practice will hinder scientific progress and cause losses to production. A hundred schools of thought contend, and launching criticism and self-criticism in academic circles is an excellent way to prevent such deviations and one-sidedness.

Science has its traditions and inheritance, and is the crystallization of the wisdom of the masses and years of experience. Although our foundation for modern scientific research is still very weak, we have accumulated some in individual departments. Since liberation, facts have proved that under the guiding principles of socialist construction, measures that are good at utilizing past experience and accumulated data (such as wheat selection) will play a significant role in practice, while starting from scratch by negating the past will fall far behind. Our country has an extremely long and rich tradition in agriculture and medicine. If we can scientifically organize it in time with modern knowledge, we will surely be able to create a new style and show unique brilliance in modern science. This is also something that should be paid attention to in teaching reform.

    教学改革中的百家争鸣
    娄成后
    解放以来，在高等学校教学改革的过程中，高等教育部经常召集全国有关院校的教学工作人员，讨论、制定各种专业的教学计划和各种课程的教学大纲。在这个工作中，首先根据我国建设上的需要，讨论专业的设置和培养专业人才的目标，随后制定教学计划，安排课程的项目、顺序、教学和实习的时数等等，以便达到这个目标。每个课程就它在教学计划中的任务和有关课程的联系，选定它的内容，制定出教学和实习大纲来。在早期的尝试中，只有在苏联专家的帮助下并且利用苏联的有关资料作为蓝本，才能够在短时间内把这庞杂的体系建立起来。有了这个共同的认识和体系，高等教育才能保证理论同实际结合，划定培养人才的标准，普遍提高教学的水平。这一切，远不是解放以前漫无目的的旧教育制度所能比拟的。
    然而在教学中，执行这些计划并不是没有困难和缺点的。由于新课程的种类繁多，教材和师资的缺乏，学生程度的参差不齐，社会运动的频繁，以及规章制度的多次更动，使得教学效果和培养出来的人才，并不如预期的那样满意。而最突出的缺点，是他们在解决实际问题中，往往表现出受一些固定教条的束缚，工作偏于笼统和粗糙，基本操作不够娴熟，能够运用的办法有限。仔细追究原因，这同我们初次制定教学计划缺乏经验、学习苏联比较生硬，没有能切合我国目前实际情况有关，特别是现在本着“百家争鸣”的精神向科学进军的时候，更有必要检查一下，我们在教学改革中，有没有把已经获得的成就认为满足，拘泥于“一家之言”，因而脱离现实、流于偏狭的倾向。
    试拿苏联高等农业院校在1948年8月生物科学会议以后制定的植物生理学教学大纲和最近我们修订大纲时参考用的苏联1954年新的教学大纲来说，虽则它们的主导精神是一致的，但是不难看到，两者间有不少的差别。按照旧大纲作蓝本教学的时候，在有些节目的具体解释上曾经遇到一些困难，只能以当时翻译过来的苏联教材作为依据。现在看来，有些论点不够成熟，有些批判不够公允，不宜单方面地列入教材中去。仅就发育一章来说，小麦春化处理的不可逆性，在当时就同国际文献中的实验报告抵触；植物在光照阶段中要求不断光照或不断黑暗的说法，根本同生物和环境统一以及自然界有昼夜光暗的交替就有矛盾的地方。马铃薯的退化原因，并不仅仅是由于高温，到现在还在争论；田间的恶性莠草，被认为是由于作物退化而来的说法，近来在苏联已经受到公开的批判。而这些未经公认的“一家之言”所以能一度列入教材里，很难说不是受了“惟我独尊”思想的影响。而在苏联的新大纲里，已经把一些还待考验的节目都删去了的。
    解放初期，我们仅听到一些对李比希植物矿质营养学说的批判，就对他的机械唯物观点痛加驳斥，同时却提出土壤肥力和单位面积产量可以无限增长的口号，这样的作法很容易使初学的人产生一些不切实际的盲目乐观情绪，而对熟悉李比希贡献的人没有多少帮助。前年来我国讲学的苏联土壤学专家却不是这样作法。他耐心而详尽地阐述了土壤学的发展史，举出了李比希的卓越贡献：李比希根据当时科学的成就和实地试验打倒了盛行一时但不正确的土壤肥力“腐植质”学说，在理论上证明了植物的土壤营养主要在于矿质，在实践上奠定了庞大的化学肥料工业的基础。正如马克思所说，农产品来自田间而消耗于城市，地力因而急剧耗损，确实需要将营养矿质归还于土地，因之他的归还法则是切合时宜的。苏联专家随着肯定这位农业化学创始人的功绩之后，又正确地批评李比希为他的伟大发现所蒙蔽，固执他的观点，把土壤当作被动的营养矿质的容纳器，而认识不到土壤是发展着的自然体。李比希的错误思想把这门科学的发展引上了绝路，而使得他本人的晚年工作到处碰壁。照这样从辩证唯物的发展观点，把一家学说的短长源源本本地叙述出来，怎能不令人心悦诚服而对学问有所启发呢？
    在批判欧美遗传学说的反动本质的时候，我们指出有机体中种质超然在体质之外而存在的说法是形而上学的，我们指出不能脱离有机体的整个生活而强调染色体的遗传性，也正是指出了同“惟我独尊”的片面思想同样的错误。这种局部脱离整体的看法还不时地在欧美学说中暴露出来，而且这种趋向曾被资产阶级统治者为了维护自己的利益加以维护和利用。但是欧美的科学也是根据实际的观察和试验而发展的，并不是停滞不前的。现代欧美的遗传学家并不都认为核物质是一成不变的东西，并且对细胞器（胞核、质体、粒线体等）同细胞质的遗传，以及它们之间的相互关系都有了不少的新发现，在它们的生物化学机构的研究上也有了长足的进步。
    但是，在我们的教学工作中，我们虽然在生物化学上着重介绍蛋白质是生活物质的主要成分，而在生物学课程里却认为核物质（特别是染色体）是种“禁忌”，避而不谈，或者在谈到遗传性的物质基础的时候，却有把细胞内部结构一视同仁、主次不分的倾向，甚至有时把一些染色体中科学界公认的现象，如减数分裂与世代交替的关系，都抛开不提。难怪现在从未听过什么是染色体的学生，听到批判染色体学说的时候，只能囫囵吞枣，强咽下去，而一听到有人在研究染色体的时候，就要发生莫名其妙的警惕。这些“禁忌”不是没有来由的。我们在教学上疏忽了某一方面，在实践上就会遭受到相应的损失。正是因为在遗传学上过分强调了物种形成乃是适应生存条件改变而引起的一定变异，而忽视了核物质本身构造上的更动也会在有机体中引起有利的改变，在实践上就杜绝了一些利用物理化学因素处理的迅速而有效的育种方法。
    个别的科学观察和试验，比起自然界永无休止的千变万化来是渺小、片断并受时代背景的限制的。因之，一个时代某些科学家的卓越发现，只是在绝对真理的长流中的某些方面推进了一步。就现代的知识对它作适当的评价，是有它肯定的作用的，然而如上所述，没有足够的事实根据就强作夸大的理论概括，再来指导实践，那就会阻碍科学进步，使生产受到损失。百家争鸣，在学术界展开批评和自我批评是防止这种偏差和片面性的绝好方法。
    科学有它的传统和继承性，是群众智慧和多年经验的结晶。虽然我们对现代科学研究的基础还很薄弱，但是个别部门中多少也积累了一些。解放以后，事实证明，在社会主义建设的指导原则下，善于利用过去经验和积存资料（如小麦的选种）的措施，在实践上就会起很大的作用，而一笔抹煞过去从头搞起的作法，却远远地落在后面。我国在农业和医学上有着极其悠久而丰富的传统，若能就现代知识及时地加以科学整理，必然可以在现代科学上别开生面，独出异彩。这也是在教学改革中应该注意到的。
