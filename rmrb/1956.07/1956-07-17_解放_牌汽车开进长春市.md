    "Liberation" Brand Automobiles Enter Changchun City
    Chen Ji Bao Shun Shu Xian
    On the 14th, the first batch of "Liberation" brand domestically produced automobiles appeared on the streets of beautiful Changchun.

    Forty-six-year-old veteran driver Ma Guofan specially shaved his beard, put on a neat light blue coat, and walked into the driver's seat of the first car in high spirits, guiding the twelve newly made cars onto the streets of Changchun. This old driver, who has been driving for more than twenty years, was driving a domestically produced car for the first time. On the night of the 13th, he went to inspect the roads of Changchun with great excitement. Driving the fourth car was a young nineteen-year-old girl named Wang Lizhong. She had just completed a driver training course last winter. Because she worked well, more than one hundred drivers at the automobile factory voted to elect her and other drivers to drive the first batch of successfully trial-produced cars. When she sat on the soft seat of the domestically produced car, she was so excited that tears welled up in her eyes.

    A long line of domestically produced cars left the factory. From the rooftops of the automobile factory, through the glass windows, and along both sides of the road, a burst of cheers and enthusiastic applause erupted immediately. These heroes who built China's first automobile factory with their own hands and manufactured the first batch of domestically produced automobiles were particularly excited and nervous today. Look, the workers from the engine workshop are coming. Some are lying on the outer casing of the car engine, listening carefully to its sound. Probably hearing a harmonious sound, they breathe a sigh of relief and run to another car. Li Longtian, a process engineer from the chassis workshop, excitedly climbed into a car to study the effectiveness of the shock absorbers they had just successfully trial-produced a few days ago. When he felt that the car was running smoothly, he raised his head happily.

    At two o'clock in the afternoon, the cars entered Changchun City. On the wide Stalin Avenue, a constant stream of people surged like a tide. In front of the gates of the Jilin Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Jilin Provincial People's Committee, firecrackers and drums sounded in unison. Girls sprinkled colorful confetti on the bright green cars, and the cars were decorated like brides wearing grand costumes. Children wearing red scarves pointed innocently at the cars, reading out one word at a time: "First Automobile Manufacturing Plant." Wang Fengxiang, the director of the Xinghuo Agricultural Cooperative who had just come to Changchun from Sandao Township, Jiutai County, to study, saw this motorcade in front of the Fifth Department Store. He said in an unexpected tone: "Oh, we heard that Changchun is building an automobile factory, but we never thought that cars would be successfully trial-produced today!" The agricultural cooperative he leads plans to purchase a "Liberation" brand car in 1958. He asked particularly about the car's load capacity and speed... He heard that this car could carry 4,000 kilograms and travel 15 kilometers in one hour. He said with emotion: "Our four-horse carts can only travel seven kilometers in an hour and can only carry about 1,000 kilograms at a time. If we use your cars, our agricultural cooperative will be transformed!" Many workers, students, citizens, and an eighty-three-year-old man named Wang Dianqing, all came to stroke the cars, asking questions. After the cars had driven far away, many people still looked into the distance, unwilling to leave. People couldn't help but sincerely congratulate the end of the history that the motherland could not manufacture automobiles, and congratulate the motherland's socialist construction cause for taking another big step forward.

    “解放”牌汽车开进长春市
    陈迹　宝顺　述仙
    十四日，美丽的长春市街头出现了第一批“解放”牌国产汽车。
    四十六岁的老司机马国范，特地刮光了胡子，穿起整洁的淡蓝色外衣，精神饱满地走进了第一辆汽车的驾驶室，引导着十二辆新制成的汽车开往长春街头。这位开了二十多年车的老司机第一次驾驶国产汽车，十三日夜晚，他就怀着极兴奋的心情去察看长春市的道路。驾驶第四辆汽车的是一位十九岁的年轻姑娘王立忠。她在去年冬天刚刚学完司机训练班的课程，因为她工作得好，汽车厂的一百多名司机才投票选举她和其他司机一起，来驾驶第一批试制成功的汽车。当她坐上国产汽车的柔软的椅子的时候，兴奋得眼睛里滚动着泪水。
    一长排国产汽车出厂了。汽车厂的屋顶上、玻璃窗口里和道路两旁，立即爆发出一阵欢呼声和热烈的掌声。这些用自己的双手建造起我国第一座汽车工厂、制造出第一批国产汽车的英雄们，今天都特别兴奋和紧张。你看，发动机车间的工人走来了，有的伏在汽车发动机的外壳上，细细倾听着它的声响。大概是听到声音和谐吧，才松口气跑到另一辆汽车旁边去。底盘车间的工艺师李龙天，激动地爬上汽车去研究前几天他们才试制成功的减震器的效能。当他感到汽车走得很平稳的时候，才愉快地昂起头来。
    下午两点钟，汽车开进了长春市。宽阔的斯大林大街上，像潮水一般涌来不断的人流。在中共吉林省委员会和吉林省人民委员会的门前，鞭炮声和锣鼓声齐鸣。姑娘们把五彩缤纷的纸屑洒在碧绿的汽车身上，汽车被打扮得好像穿着盛装的新娘。戴着红领巾的孩子们天真地指着汽车，一个字一个字地念着：“第一汽车制造厂”。刚从九台县三道乡到长春来学习的星火农业合作社主任王凤祥，在第五商店门口看到了这个汽车队，他用出乎意料的口吻说：“哎呀，我们听说过长春正在建设汽车厂，可真想不到今天汽车就试制成功啦！”他领导的农业社打算在1958年购买一辆“解放”牌汽车。他特别关心地打听这种汽车的载重量、速度……他听说这种汽车能拉四千公斤东西，一点钟能跑十五公里，不胜感慨地说：“我们的四匹马的大车，一小时才走七公里，一次才能拉一千来公斤。要是用上你们的汽车，我们的农业社就要变样儿啦！”许多工人、学生、市民，还有一个八十三岁的老人王殿清，都赶来抚摸汽车，问长问短。当汽车开出很远之后，还有许多人远远了望不肯走开。人们都不禁由衷地祝贺祖国不能制造汽车的历史的结束，祝贺祖国社会主义建设事业又迈进了一大步。
