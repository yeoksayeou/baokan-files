    Exorbitant Rents
    Yu Jin
    More than a thousand years ago, the great poet Du Fu wrote these lines: "Oh, for a vast mansion of ten thousand rooms, to shelter all the poor scholars of the world and make them rejoice, a bulwark against wind and rain, as stable as a mountain!"

    More than a thousand years later, a few landlords in Shenyang are doing the following: requiring tenants to prepay rent for one or even four years, with rents as high as thirteen to twenty yuan per room per month. Otherwise, they would rather leave the houses empty than rent them out.

    The poet Du Fu hoped for "a vast mansion of ten thousand rooms" so that "all the poor scholars of the world" could live in them and avoid the suffering of "wind and rain." The few landlords in Shenyang are calculating how to take advantage of their ownership of houses to extort high rents endlessly. The ancient poet was so concerned about people, while these modern landlords are so concerned about money. The contrast is as stark as heaven and earth.

    In the high tide of socialist transformation, many landlords have made great progress. They are willing to rent out their vacant houses according to normal procedures and normal rents, so that those without homes can settle down and actively participate in work and production. However, these few landlords are just the opposite. They attempt to monopolize housing in order to arbitrarily demand rent. This behavior adds extra burdens to some tenants and creates difficulties for more tenants that could have been overcome.

    This behavior is not only wrong but also illegal. Now, the government allows private individuals to rent out houses and allows landlords to receive a certain amount of rent. However, no one is allowed to use housing for speculation and manipulation. These landlords had better consciously correct their mistakes and provide tenants with the convenience they deserve. As the saying goes, to be fair, put yourself in the other's shoes. If these landlords could think from the tenants' perspective, they probably wouldn't feel so comfortable!

    The era when Du Fu only had good wishes but could not realize them concretely has long passed. Our country cares about the people's housing problems and can solve them. We are building thousands upon thousands of new houses for people to live in; we will also use thousands upon thousands of old houses for people to live in. In this work, will you play a positive role or a negative role? I hope that those who are now making things difficult for the people by exploiting housing will choose wisely.

    惊人的房租
    余今
    一千多年以前，伟大的诗人杜甫曾经写过这样的诗句：“安得广厦千万间，大庇天下寒士俱欢颜，风雨不动安如山！”
    一千多年以后，沈阳市的少数房主却在做着这样的事实：出租房屋必须住户预付一年甚至四年的租金，有的租额（每月每间）竟高达十三元至二十元。不然，宁愿使房屋空着，也不出租。
    诗人杜甫希望的是：有“广厦千万间”，使“天下寒士”都能住进去，以免尝受“风雨”之苦。沈阳的少数房主盘算的是：利用自己拥有的房屋，乘人之危，无止境地勒索高额的房租。古代的诗人是那样的关怀人，现代这些房主是这样地关怀钱，对比一下，这真是天上和地下的悬殊。
    在社会主义改造的高潮中，许多房主都有了很大进步，他们愿意把自己的空闲房屋按照正常手续和正常租额出租。使那些没有住处的人安定下来，能够积极的参加工作和生产。可是，这些少数房主恰恰相反，他们企图将房屋垄断起来，以便任意索取房租。这种行为，给一些住户增加了分外的负担，给更多的住户制造了本来可以克服的困难。
    这种行为不仅是错误的，而且是违法的。现在，政府允许私人出租房屋，并允许房主得到一定的租金。但是，决不能允许任何人利用房屋来进行投机取巧、操纵把持的活动。这些房主们最好自觉的改正自己的错误，给住户以应有的方便。俗话说，若要公道，打过颠倒，这些房主们，如果能够设身处地替住户想一想，恐怕就不会那么心安理得了吧！
    杜甫的仅有善良愿望而无法具体实现的时代早已过去了。我们的国家关怀人民的居住问题，也能够解决人民的居住问题。我们正在兴建千千万万新的住宅，供给人民居住；我们也要利用千千万万旧的房屋，供给人民居住。在这个工作中，是发挥积极作用呢？还是起消极作用呢？希望那些现在利用房屋和人民为难的人善自选择。
