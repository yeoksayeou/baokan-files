    Reclaiming the Mosuo Bay
    Millions of Mu of Fertile Land Awaken
    Mosuo Bay is located on the east bank of the Manas River, 80 kilometers north of Manas County. Production and Construction Corps soldiers have established many farms on the west bank of the river. Today, their spearhead is pointed towards this wasteland on the east bank. Soldiers returning from surveying Mosuo Bay reported to the division political commissar, saying, "There are more than a million mu of wasteland there, and the soil is very fertile, but it lacks water." Political Commissar Yu Zhengdong said, "We must divert the water from the Manas River there to awaken this land." Not long after the political commissar's words, in April of this year, a wasteland survey team of more than 200 people came here. Among them were young people newly arrived from Guangdong, Jiangsu, and Sichuan. Under the leadership of veteran surveyors, after more than two months, they slowly came to understand surveying, and some also learned to identify soil. Currently, the geodetic control team has completed its work here and moved to a new construction site. The topographic survey team and the soil detailed survey team are braving the summer sun, traveling back and forth on this land. They plan to leave here in August. Once the data is collected, the planning of new farms in Mosuo Bay will begin.

    开垦莫索湾
    百万亩沃土苏醒
    莫索湾，在玛纳斯河东岸，玛纳斯县城以北八十公里。生产建设部队的战士们，在河的西岸建立了许多农场，今天，他们的矛头又指向东岸这一片荒地了。战士们从莫索湾踏勘回来，向师政委汇报说：“那里有荒地一百多万亩，土壤很肥，只是缺水。”政委鱼正东说：“我们一定要把玛纳斯河的水引过去，让这片土地苏醒过来。”政委的话，说过没有多久，今年四月，一支二百多人组成的荒地勘测队来到这里。他们当中有新从广东、江苏、四川来的青年。在老测量员带领下，经过两个多月，他们慢慢地懂得了测量，有的也学会鉴别土壤了。目前，大地控制队已经结束了这里的工作，转移到新的工地，地形测量队和土壤详查队的人，正冒着夏天的骄阳，来往在这片土地上。他们准备八月离开这里。当资料搜集好后，莫索湾新的农场就要开始规划了。
