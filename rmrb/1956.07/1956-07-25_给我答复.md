    After graduating from the Zhongnan 247 Technical School of Jiangxi Province last August, I was assigned to work in a certain factory. Before leaving the school, the school's Party General Branch notified me to bring my application materials for joining the Party with me to the factory. Therefore, I followed the instructions and went to the General Branch to collect them, but to my surprise, they searched and searched but couldn't find them. Helpless, I had to ask them to send them to the factory later if they found them. Soon after, probably because they couldn't find them, they wrote to me saying that maybe a classmate had taken my materials to the factory. However, none of the classmates who worked with me knew anything about this. Later, I wrote several letters to the school's Party General Branch to inquire about the materials, but it has been almost a year without any reply.

    I request this Party General Branch to reply: Why is the safekeeping of materials related to joining the Party so irresponsible? Why are my subsequent letters ignored? (Xu Hanying)

    给我答复
    去年八月我从江西省中南二四七技工学校毕业后，被分配到某工厂去工作。离校前夕，学校党总支通知我，要我把申请入党的材料随身带到某工厂去。于是，我遵嘱到党总支去领，谁知到了总支办公室，他们翻来翻去，始终找不到。无奈，我只好请他们以后找到了寄到厂里去。不久，大概是他们无法找到了，写信告诉我说，可能有同学把我的材料带到厂里去了。但是，同我在一块工作的同学，谁都不晓得这回事。后来，我又给学校党总支写了几封查询材料的信，现在快一年一直不见答复。
    我要请求这个党总支答复，为什么保管入党问题的材料这样不负责任？为什么对我以后写的信置之不理？　（徐含英）
