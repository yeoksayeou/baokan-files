    Shanghai is actively preparing to implement universal compulsory education.
    (By Our Correspondent) The Shanghai Education Bureau is working hard to prepare for the implementation of universal compulsory education throughout the city this autumn. The Shanghai Education Bureau has conducted a preliminary survey of the number of students likely to enroll this year. According to initial statistics, approximately 170,000 primary school students will enroll this year.
    To solve the problem of a large number of new students entering school, the Shanghai Education Bureau has decided to implement a two-shift system in most primary schools throughout the city. The Shanghai Education Bureau believes that 46% of primary school students in the city already implemented the two-shift teaching system last year, and the results were generally good. Therefore, implementing the two-shift system is the most important way to solve the current shortage of schools. At the same time, the Shanghai Education Bureau plans to complete the construction of eleven new schools in the city before the start of the new school year this year.
    In order to implement universal compulsory education, a large teaching force is also being organized. It is estimated that Shanghai will add about 4,000 primary school teachers this year. Currently, some cadres from government organs and educated youth from society who are suitable to become teachers are studying in teacher training classes organized by the Education Bureau.

    上海市积极准备实行普及义务教育
    本报讯　上海市教育局正在努力做好各项准备工作，迎接今年秋天就要在全市实行的普及义务教育。上海教育局对于今年可能入学的人数进行了摸底，据初步的统计，今年入学的小学生约有十七万人。
    为了解决大批新生入学的问题，上海市教育局决定在全市绝大部分小学校实行二部制。上海市教育局认为，去年全市已经有46％的小学生实行了二部制教学，效果一般都良好，因此，实行二部制是解决目前学校不足的最主要的途径。同时，上海市教育局计划在市内新建的十一个学校，在今年的新学年到来前就可以完工。
    为了实施普及义务教育，一个庞大的教师队伍也正在组织中，预计今年上海市要增加四千名左右的小学教师。目前一部分适合做教师的机关干部和社会知识青年，正在教育局举办的师资训练班里学习。
