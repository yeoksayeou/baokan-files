Turpan Rural Areas Have Telephones

    (Reported by Xinjiang Daily Editorial Department) The rural areas of Turpan County, the famous grape-producing region, have been widely equipped with telephones and began operations on July 1. This is the first county in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region to basically achieve telephone access in every township.
    The county's telephone line is 140 kilometers long, with seven switchboards, connecting all six districts, twenty-five townships, and one experimental farm in the county. The "Five-Star" Agricultural Production Cooperative, which is engaged in socialist competition with the "Eastern Light" collective farm in Soviet Kazakhstan, has also installed telephones.

    吐鲁番农村有了电话
    本报讯　著名的葡萄产地——吐鲁番县的农村，已经普遍安装了电话，于七月一日开始通话。这是新疆维吾尔自治区境内第一个基本上达到乡乡通电话的县。
    这个县的电话线路，全长一百四十公里，有七部交换机，贯通着全县六个区、二十五个乡和一个试验农场。同苏联哈萨克斯坦“东方之光”集体农庄开展社会主义竞赛的“五星”农业生产合作社也安装了电话。
