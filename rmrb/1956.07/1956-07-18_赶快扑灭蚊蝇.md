    Quickly Eradicate Mosquitoes and Flies

    China has used decisive methods to eliminate a large number of pests, which has been praised by the world. This battle must continue. This year, there seem to be significantly more flies and mosquitoes in Beijing than in the past. I think we don't need to wait for the government to issue new calls before taking action to eradicate them. We should regard every fly and mosquito as an irreconcilable enemy threatening our own and our children's lives. Let's take action! Don't let flies and mosquitoes escape by chance and continue to do harm.

    赶快扑灭蚊蝇
    中国用果断的办法消灭了大量害虫，这是为全世界所赞扬的。这种战斗必须继续下去。今年，北京的苍蝇和蚊虫比过去似乎大大地增多了。我想，我们不必等待政府发出新的号召才来动手扑灭。我们应当把每个苍蝇和蚊子看作是威胁自己和孩子生命的不共戴天的仇敌。行动起来吧！不要让苍蝇蚊子侥幸逃生，继续为害。		英国朋友　艾德尼
