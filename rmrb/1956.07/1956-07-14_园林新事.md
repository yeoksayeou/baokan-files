    New Developments in Gardens
    Double Swing at Taoranting Park
    Taoranting Park is installing a double swing that allows two people to swing at the same time. This swing is different from the common swings in China; instead of wooden footboards, it has a light iron box like a cart. This double swing is specially for young people and adults to play on.

    New Look for the Temples of the Sun and Moon
    The Temple of the Sun outside Chaoyangmen and the Temple of the Moon outside Fuchengmen are changing their desolate appearances. Grass is being laid and roads are being repaired next to the trees planted this spring. The Temple of the Moon is erecting bamboo fences to replace the old walls. The renovated Temples of the Sun and Moon will become good places for people in the suburbs to take walks and sightsee. (Xing)
    The Ancient Temple of Heaven is Young Again
    The ancient Temple of Heaven, known for its solemnity, has now become a new type of park that is both ancient and young. Flower beds have appeared in its pine and cypress forests and in the large areas of wasteland in the past.
    Now, the horticultural workers of the Temple of Heaven Park have cleared the flowers and plants that bloomed and withered in the spring, and replanted summer-blooming balsams, dwarf jasmines, cannas, dahlias, and cockscomb flowers. Various colors of flowers are mixed together, fragrantly welcoming visitors. (Jing)
    Shan Guo Temple Park is More Beautiful
    Shan Guo Temple Park in Xuanwu District has attracted more children in recent days. In groups of two or three, they run to the northeast corner of the park, happily playing in the children's playground where new swivel chairs, seesaws, and other equipment have been installed. Mothers leading their children sit on the new park chairs under the shade of the trees, watching their little darlings with smiling faces.
    The trees planted two years ago on the earthen hill in the park, along the winding paths, have already become lush and green, and the shrubs in the flower beds are blooming with various colors of flowers. (Jing)

    园林新事
    陶然亭的双人秋千
    陶然亭正在安装一种两人能同时荡摆的双人秋千。这种秋千和我国常见的秋千不同，代替木踏板的是一个像斗车一样的轻便铁箱。这种双人秋千是专供青年和成年人玩的。　（邢）
    日坛、月坛的新面貌
    朝阳门外的日坛和阜成门外的月坛正在改变自己的荒凉面貌。在今春种下的树旁正铺草皮并修缮道路。月坛正架起竹篱笆代替旧围墙。修缮后的日坛和月坛将成为郊区人民散步、游览的好地方。（邢）
    古老的天坛年轻了
    以肃穆著称的古老的天坛，现在已经成为一座既古老又年轻的新型公园了。在它的松柏林中和过去大片的荒地上，出现了座座花坛。
    现在，天坛公园的园艺工人，清除了春季开谢的花草，重新培植上夏季盛开的凤仙、矮茉莉、美人蕉、大理花、鸡冠草。各色花朵杂陈，芬芳馥郁地迎接着游人。　（京）
    善果寺公园更美了
    宣武区善果寺公园，最近几天吸引来更多的少年儿童。他们三三两两地奔向公园的东北角，在新安上转椅、跷板等设备的儿童运动场里，高高兴兴地玩耍着。领着孩子来的妈妈，坐在树荫下崭新的园椅上，满脸笑容地看视着她的小宝贝。
    公园里的土山上，园路曲径的两旁，两年前栽植的树木，已经碧绿成荫，花坛里的灌木丛盛开着各色花朵。　（京）
