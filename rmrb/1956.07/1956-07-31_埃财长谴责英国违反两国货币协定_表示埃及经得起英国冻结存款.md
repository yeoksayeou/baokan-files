Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, July 30th: Egyptian Finance Minister al-Kaissouni today accused Britain of violating the monetary agreement signed with Egypt. Britain announced on the 28th that it was freezing Egyptian pound deposits in retaliation for Egypt's nationalization of the Suez Canal.

The Finance Minister said that Britain's decision violated the monetary agreement signed by Egypt and the United Kingdom in 1951 and amended in 1955, and had absolutely no legal basis.

Kaissouni said that the Egyptian economy will withstand this action by Britain. He said, "Thanks to the independent financial policies pursued by Egypt in recent years, our large gold and foreign exchange reserves, and the trade and payment agreements we have signed with most countries with whom we have extensive business relations, the Egyptian economy is able to stand firm and confidently against the recent illegal measures of the British government."

Previously, Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser had discussed the financial situation caused by the nationalization of the Suez Canal and the freezing of Egyptian assets by Britain and France with Kaissouni yesterday. Kaissouni later told reporters that Egypt was prepared "to face all eventualities."

Before discussing with Abdel Nasser, Kaissouni also held talks with commercial, financial and industrial experts, and prepared a detailed list of British and French companies operating in Egypt. Kaissouni studied this list with Nasser.

    埃财长谴责英国违反两国货币协定
    表示埃及经得起英国冻结存款
    新华社30日讯　开罗消息：埃及财政部长凯舒尼今天指责英国违反了同埃及签订的货币协定。英国为了报复埃及把苏彝士运河收归国有的行动在二十八日宣布冻结埃及的英镑存款。
    这位财政部长说，英国的这个决定违反了埃及和联合王国在1951年签订的、在1955年修正的货币协定，并且是根本没有法律根据的。
    凯舒尼说，埃及的经济将经得起英国的这个行动。他说，“由于埃及过去几年执行的独立的财政政策，我们的大量黄金和外汇储存，以及我们同大多数同我们有广泛的商务关系的国家签订的贸易和支付协定，埃及的经济能够坚定地、有信心地经得起英国政府最近的非法措施”。
    在这以前，埃及总统阿卜杜勒·纳赛尔曾在昨天同凯舒尼商谈了苏彝士运河国有化和英法冻结埃及资财所引起的财政局面。凯舒尼后来对记者说，埃及准备“面对一切不测事件”。
    凯舒尼在同阿卜杜勒·纳赛尔商谈以前，还曾经同商业、财政和工业专家们进行了会谈，并且准备了一张在埃及营业的英国和法国公司的详细一览表。凯舒尼同纳赛尔一起研究了这张表。
