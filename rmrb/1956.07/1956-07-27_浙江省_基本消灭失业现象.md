Zhejiang Province

Basically Eliminates Unemployment

(Our newspaper, Hangzhou, July 25th) Zhejiang Province has now basically eliminated unemployment. Over the past six years, more than 130,000 unemployed and jobless people have been employed. Among them, more than 117,000 were organized and allocated by labor administrative departments to participate in national construction, and more than 10,000 were introduced to employment by relevant departments.

　　Of these more than 130,000 employed people, excluding more than 15,000 who went to Xinjiang, Qinghai, Xi'an and other places to support the country's industrial construction, all were placed within the province according to their education level and technical expertise. In order to create employment conditions for personnel with junior high school or higher education, in recent years, the Zhejiang Provincial Labor Administrative Department, together with relevant units, has also held training courses in accounting, statistics, civil engineering, textiles, hardware technicians, railway employees, and nursery workers, training more than 12,000 people.

　　Among these more than 130,000 employed people, 110,000 were unemployed workers, shop assistants, small vendors, old intellectuals, technicians, and unemployed and jobless people without education or skills left over from the old society; the other more than 20,000 were unemployed people in industries that were no longer suitable for the needs of the people due to the reorganization of the national economy and changes in people's living habits after liberation. Over the past six years, Zhejiang labor administrative departments have spent a total of more than 6.45 million yuan on unemployment relief and employment placement.

　　Now, in Zhejiang Province, apart from the old, weak, disabled, and other people who are currently unable to be employed, all unemployed and jobless people who are qualified to participate in work have been fully placed, and the phenomenon of unemployment has been basically eliminated. Therefore, since July 1st of this year, all levels of relief agencies in the province have been completely abolished, and the unemployment worker relief fund has also ceased to be collected.

    浙江省
    基本消灭失业现象
    本报杭州25日电　浙江省现在已经基本消灭失业现象，六年来有十三万多失业、无业人员就业。其中有十一万七千多人由劳动行政部门组织调配参加国家建设事业，有一万多人由有关部门介绍就业。
    这十三万多就业人员中，除去一万五千多人到新疆、青海、西安等地支援祖国工业建设外、全部根据各人的文化程度、技术特长在省内安置。为了替具有高小、初中以上文化程度的人员创造就业条件，几年来，浙江省劳动行政部门同有关单位还先后举办了会计、统计、土木工程、纺织、五金技工、铁路员工、保育员等训练班，训练了一万二千多人。
    这十三万多就业人员中，有十一万人是旧社会遗留下来的失业工人、店员、小商贩、旧知识分子、技术员以及无文化、技术的失业、无业人员；另外二万多人是解放后由于国民经济改组、人民生活习惯改变，不适合人民需要的行业的失业人员。六年来，浙江劳动行政部门对失业救济和安置就业工作等方面支出经费共达645万多元。
    现在浙江省除了老弱、残废以及其他一部分目前不可能就业的人员外，对失业、无业有条件参加工作的人员全面进行了安置，失业现象已基本消灭。因此，自今年七月一日起，全省各级救济机构已全部撤销，失业工人救济基金也已停止征收。
