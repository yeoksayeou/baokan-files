    In the Soviet Union
    Over Two Thousand Coal Mining
    Combines
    Xinhua News Agency, according to TASS reports: The Soviet Union ranks first in the world in terms of the number of coal mining combines in use. Currently, there are more than two thousand two hundred coal mining combines working in mines across the country. They replace a large amount of manual labor in excavating coal seams and greatly improve labor productivity in coal mining.
    The Soviet coal mining industry receives new, high-efficiency coal mining combines every year. The adoption of the new "ШБМ type" combine has completely changed the face of the working surface of Mine No. 7 in the Donets Coal Basin. It undertakes all labor processes such as drilling, blasting, and loading rock onto coal cars in roadway excavation. This mine alone freed up five excavation teams by using this combine, allowing them to engage in other work.
    The "ПК一一 type" coal mining combine, recently created by Soviet engineers, can easily overcome the limitations of coal seams with slopes of thirty degrees or more, mining coal seams in very difficult geographical conditions, and consumes very little electricity. Mining coal with this combine costs 40% to 50% less than coal mined with the "Miner" type combine.
    In 1956, the degree of mechanization in Soviet coal mines will be greatly improved. The mines of Donbas, Kuzbass, and Karaganda will receive many new coal mining combines and transportation machines. The mines in the Moscow Coal Region will receive a "ПК—three type" coal mining combine. This machine is even superior to the "ПК一一 type" combine. It can excavate twelve to fourteen meters of roadway per shift.
    Fur Resources and Products Increased Significantly
    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 11th: An article published in the fourth issue of the Soviet "Foreign Trade" magazine this year stated that the Soviet Union ranks first in the world in terms of fur resources and the export volume of fur products.
    Compared with 1940, the number of animal farms in Soviet collective farms has doubled, the number of fur-bearing animals they raise has tripled, and the number of valuable animals such as minks, arctic foxes, and black foxes raised on state farms has increased thirteen to twenty-nine times.
    The magazine pointed out that in the Soviet Union, more than 130 kinds of fur-bearing animals are hunted in the hunting industry. Among them are many valuable fur-bearing animals known to the world's fur markets. They are distributed in a vast area from the Arctic to Kazakhstan and Central Asia, and from Kamchatka in the Far East to Ukraine and Belarus in the west. The fur of these fur-bearing animals produced in the Soviet Union is not only high in quantity, but also many of its furs have always enjoyed a high reputation in domestic and foreign fur markets in terms of quality.
    The Soviet Union's Karakul lambskin is world-renowned for its production and quality, and its number of Karakul sheep ranks first in the world.
    Canned Food Production Ranks First in Europe
    Xinhua News Agency, 12th: According to TASS reports: The southern regions of the Soviet Union are currently in the production season for canned vegetables and fruits. The Soviet Union's canned food production currently ranks first in Europe.
    A spokesman for the Soviet Ministry of Food Industry told a TASS reporter that a canning factory in the town of Krymskaya in the Krasnodar Territory alone will produce 100 million cans by the end of this year, which is more than the total canned food production of the entire Russia before the October Revolution. At present, the Soviet Union is building more than 30 large canning factories and many small and medium-sized enterprises. After these enterprises are put into full production, canned food production will increase by more than 50%.
    Canned food enterprises put into production in the Sixth Five-Year Plan (1956-1960) can produce approximately one billion cans of vegetables and fruits and three hundred million cans of fish annually. These enterprises alone will produce more than 310,000 cans of meat and 370,000 cans of milk in a single day.

    在苏联
    二千多台采煤
    联合机
    新华社据塔斯社报道　苏联采煤工业在使用采煤联合机的数量方面占世界第一位。现在，苏联共有二千二百多台采煤联合机在各地的矿井中工作。它们代替大量的人力挖掘煤层，并且大大提高了采煤的劳动生产率。
    苏联采煤工业每年都获得新式的高效率的采煤联合机。新型的“ШБМ式”联合机的采用，完全改变了顿尼兹煤区第七号矿井的工作面貌。它承担了掘进巷道中的钻岩、炸岩和把岩石装上煤车等一切劳动过程。单是这个矿井由于采用了这种联合机，就腾出了五个掘进工作队，使它们能够从事别的工作。
    苏联工程师不久前创制的“ПК一一式”采煤联合机，能够很容易地克服三十度或三十度以上坡度的煤层的限制，在非常困难的地理条件下开采煤层，而且消耗的电力也非常节省。用这种联合机采煤，比“矿工”式联合机所采的煤的成本还要低40％到50％。
    1956年，苏联各煤矿的机械化程度将大大提高。顿巴斯、库兹巴斯和卡拉干达的各矿井将得到许多新式采煤联合机和运输机器等。莫斯科煤区各矿井将得到一种“ПК—三式”采煤联合机。这种机器比“ПК一一式”联合机还要优越。每班可以掘进十二到十四公尺的巷道。皮毛资源和制品增加很多
    据新华社莫斯科11日电　今年第四期苏联“对外贸易”杂志登载的一篇文章说，苏联的皮毛资源和皮毛制成品的出口量占世界第一位。
    和1940年比较，现在，苏联集体农庄的养兽场的数目增加了一倍，它们饲养的皮毛兽增加了三倍，而国营农场饲养的水貂、北极狐、黑狐这样一些珍贵的兽类的只数，则增加了十三倍到二十九倍。
    这家杂志指出，在苏联，狩猎业所猎取的皮毛兽有一百三十多种。其中，包括许多闻名世界皮货市场的贵重的皮毛兽。它们分布在从北极到哈萨克和中亚细亚、从远东的堪察加到西部的乌克兰和白俄罗斯这样广大的地区内。在苏联出产的这些皮毛兽的皮毛中，不单是数量，而且许多皮毛的质量在国内外皮货市场上一直享有很高的声誉。
    苏联的卡拉库尔羔羊皮的产量和质量在世界上是驰名的，它的卡拉库尔羊的只数占世界第一位。
    罐头产量占欧洲首位
    新华社12日讯　据塔斯社报道：苏联南部地区正是蔬菜和水果罐头的生产季节。苏联的罐头产量目前占欧洲第一位。
    苏联食品工业部的发言人对塔斯社记者说，单是克拉斯诺达尔边疆区克里米亚镇的一个罐头制造厂，到今年年底就要生产一亿听罐头，这个数量比十月革命前整个俄国的罐头产量还要大。目前，苏联正在建设三十多个大罐头工厂和许多中小企业，这些企业全部投入生产后，罐头的产量将增加50％以上。
    在第六个五年计划（1956—1960年）中投入生产的罐头企业，每年可以生产约十亿听蔬菜和水果罐头，三亿听鱼类罐头。这些企业单在一天里就要生产三十一万多听肉类罐头和三十七万多听牛奶罐头。
