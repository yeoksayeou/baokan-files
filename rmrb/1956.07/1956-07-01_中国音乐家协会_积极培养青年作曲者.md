    Chinese Musicians Association
    Actively Cultivates Young Composers
    (By our newspaper) The Chinese Musicians Association recently held a forum for young composers in Beijing. Over forty young composers attended the forum. Li Huanzhi, deputy director of the Theory and Creation Committee of the Chinese Musicians Association, said at the meeting that the work of cultivating young composers has become one of the important tasks of the Music Association, and this work will be carried out nationwide soon.
    At the forum, young composers requested composers to "take apprentices" and cultivate young composers in a planned and organized way. They also hoped to organize concerts of young people's works and publish young people's works, etc.
    The Chinese Musicians Association has hired 43 composers, including Lü Ji, Ma Sicong, He Luting, Ding Shande, Jiang Dingxian, Shi Lemeng, Wang Xin, Ma Ke, Jie Fu, Qu Xixian, and Zheng Lucheng, to serve as creative consultants for young composers. Some of these composers will begin lecturing to young authors in July of this year.
