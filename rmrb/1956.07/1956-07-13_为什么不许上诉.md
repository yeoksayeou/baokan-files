    Why Appeals Are Not Allowed

    To the Editor:
    Recently, during our inspection of the work of the People's Court of Kalaqin Left Banner, Liaoning Province, we discovered that this court has a phenomenon of suppressing the right of litigants to appeal. Some cases were executed during the appeal period. For example, the case of Gao Shirong's theft was sentenced on May 3 this year and the detention center was notified to carry out the execution on the same day. In some cases, the trial personnel did not process the appeal procedures for the parties involved. For example, in the case of Du Wencheng, who was sentenced to eight years in prison for gambling on January 9 this year, the defendant stated that he wanted to appeal at the time of sentencing, but the court did not process the appeal procedures for submission to a higher court for review and simply executed the sentence.
    According to our understanding, the trial personnel who have committed such errors, in addition to not seriously studying the national laws, also have the idea of seeking convenience. A certain Mr. Li from this court said: "It's more pleasant to execute the sentence immediately after it's pronounced, it's like finishing a case; if there's an appeal, there's an appeal, if there isn't, it saves a second effort." This practice violates the Organic Law of the People's Courts and infringes upon the legitimate rights of the parties involved.

### 为什么不许上诉

    为什么不许上诉编辑同志：
    最近我们在检查辽宁省喀喇沁左旗人民法院的工作中，发现这个法院有压制诉讼当事人上诉权利的现象。有的案件在上诉期间就执行了判决。如高士荣窃盗案件，就是在今年五月三日宣判、在当天通知监所执行的。有的案件，审判人员不给当事人办理上诉手续。如今年一月九日处理的杜文成因赌博被判处有期徒刑八年的案件，被告在宣判时就声明要上诉，但是法院却没有给办理上诉手续送上级法院审理，就宣判执行了事。
    据我们的了解，犯有这样错误的审判人员除了对国家法律没有认真学习以外，还有着贪图方便的思想。这个法院的一个姓李的就说过：“宣判完了就执行，痛快些，算是办完了一件案子；上诉再说，不上诉就省着费二遍事了。”这种作法是违背人民法院组织法的，是侵害当事人合法权利的行为。
