    Let the Whole Nation Understand Qinghai

    The nation is now vigorously developing the Northwest. In Qinghai Province, there is the Qaidam Basin's petroleum industry and the rich mineral deposits of the Qilian Mountains.

    People who have come to the Qinghai area to participate in construction have the following reaction: newspapers rarely introduce the situation in Qinghai, so some people do not understand Qinghai well enough. At first, they were not very willing to come, but after arriving, no one wants to go back. This shows that newspaper publicity is insufficient. I suggest you pay more attention to news reports about Qinghai so that the whole nation can understand Qinghai.

    让全国人民都了解青海
    国家现在正在大力地建设西北，在青海省，有柴达木的石油工业，有祁连山一带的丰富的矿藏。
    来到青海地区参加建设的人们，都有这样的反应：报纸上很少介绍青海的情况，因此有些人对青海不够了解，当初是不大愿意来的，可是来到以后，谁也不愿意再回去。这说明了由于报纸宣传不够。我建议你们多关心青海的新闻报道，让全国人民都了解青海。
