    Ambassador Sukardjo Wirjopranoto delivered a speech when presenting his credentials, and Vice Chairman Zhu De delivered a reply.

    Ambassador Sukardjo Wirjopranoto said in his speech when presenting his credentials:

    In carrying out my mission, I will take the results of the Asian-African Conference held in Bandung, the Ten Principles, as my guiding principle. In this achievement of the Asian-African Conference, the delegation of the People's Republic of China, led by the esteemed Premier Zhou Enlai, played a very important role. The various achievements of the Bandung Conference strengthened the foundation for determining the form of the active and independent policy of the government of the Republic of Indonesia. Please allow me to express that in realizing the various achievements of the Bandung Conference, the strength and aspirations of all the people of Asia and Africa have become the decisive driving force.

    It can be said with certainty that the relationship between Indonesia and China is very good. I am convinced that this very good relationship will take shape in a way that is beneficial to our two countries.

    Vice Chairman Zhu De said in his reply:

    The people of China and Indonesia have a long-standing friendship. In recent years, our two peoples have established a closer and deeper friendly cooperative relationship in the common cause of safeguarding their national sovereignty, opposing colonialism, promoting friendly cooperation among Asian and African countries, and consolidating world peace. Trade, cultural exchanges, and mutual friendly visits between our two countries are constantly being strengthened and developed. The Chinese government and people are pleased to see that our friendly neighbor, the Republic of Indonesia, is playing an increasingly important role in international affairs. More than a year ago, the Asian-African Conference held in Bandung played an immeasurable role in easing international tensions and promoting friendly cooperation among the peoples of Asian and African countries. As one of the initiators and the host of the Asian-African Conference, Indonesia made a particularly significant contribution to the convening of this conference and the great achievements it achieved.

    I believe that under the guidance of the Bandung spirit, and through the efforts of Ambassador, the friendly relations between our two countries will be further developed.

    Xinhua News Agency, July 28th -- Sukardjo Wirjopranoto, the newly appointed Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of the Republic of Indonesia to China, paid a visit to our Minister of Foreign Affairs Zhou Enlai on the afternoon of the 28th to discuss matters related to the presentation of credentials.

    Present at the meeting were Ke Hua, Director of the Protocol Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and Zhang Wenjin, Deputy Director of the Asian Affairs Department.
