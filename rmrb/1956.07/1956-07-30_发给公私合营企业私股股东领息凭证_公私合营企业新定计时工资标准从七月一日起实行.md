Xinhua News Agency, July 28th – The State Council, in response to the widespread desire of private shareholders of joint state-private enterprises for an interest voucher after asset verification and the implementation of fixed interest rates, approved on July 24th the opinion of the Central Administration for Industry and Commerce on issuing interest vouchers to private shareholders of joint state-private enterprises after asset verification and stock determination. It instructed all regions to issue interest vouchers to private shareholders of joint state-private enterprises that have implemented fixed interest rates. The specific measures are as follows:

	I. The form of shareholder interest vouchers does not need to be uniform and should be determined by each region based on its actual situation. For old joint venture enterprises that have already issued stocks, private shareholders can receive dividends from the enterprise or specialized company with their stocks, without the need to exchange for new vouchers. If the private enterprise had stocks, share certificates, or other investment documents before the joint venture, and the private shareholders request not to reissue new vouchers, they can also receive dividends from the enterprise or specialized company with the original enterprise's investment documents, according to the newly verified share amount after the joint venture.

	II. The procedure for issuing interest vouchers to private shareholders should be as simple as possible. As long as private shareholders have reliable proof of investment, the enterprise or specialized company can issue vouchers. The voucher only needs to clearly state the shareholder's name, address, occupation, verified share amount, interest rate, and other items; no other restrictive provisions should be added.

	III. When private shareholders receive dividends or vouchers, if they cannot handle it in person, they can entrust someone else to do so, but the entrusted person must hold the entrusting party's authorization documents.

	IV. If enterprises or specialized companies that need to issue interest vouchers to private shareholders do not have enough time to complete the voucher issuance work before the interest distribution in July and August, they can distribute the interest first and then complete the voucher issuance procedures later.

Xinhua News Agency, July 29th – The State Council issued a notice on July 25th stating that the newly established hourly wage standards after the wage reform of new joint state-private enterprises shall be implemented from July 1, 1956.

The notice said: "The State Council has decided to convene a special meeting in early August to study the wage reform issues of enterprises that implemented joint state-private ownership after the full industry-wide joint state-private ownership and enterprises and institutions that directly transitioned from private to state-owned. It is now decided that regardless of the month in which the new wage plan is announced, the portion of the newly established hourly wage standards that is higher than the current wage shall be retroactively paid from July 1, 1956."

    发给公私合营企业私股股东领息凭证
    公私合营企业新定计时工资标准从七月一日起实行
    新华社28日讯　国务院根据公私合营企业在清产核资和实行定息以后，私股股东普遍希望有一个领息凭证的要求，在七月二十四日批转了中央工商行政管理局关于公私合营企业清产定股以后发给私股股东领息凭证的意见，并指示各地，对实行定息的公私合营企业私股股东发给领息凭证。具体办法规定如下：
    一、股东领息凭证的形式不必统一，由各地结合实际情况，自行确定。老合营企业已经发了股票的，私股股东可以凭股票向企业或专业公司领取股息，不必另换凭证；如果私营企业合营前原来就有股票、股折或其他投资证件，而私股股东要求不换发新凭证的，也可以凭原企业的投资证件，按照合营后新核定的股额向企业或专业公司领取股息。
    二、发给私股股东领息的凭证，在手续上应力求简便。只要私股股东具备确实的投资证明，企业或专业公司就可以发给凭证。凭证上只要简单地写明股东的姓名、地址、职业、核定的股额、息率等项目就够了，不应增列其他具有限制性质的规定。
    三、私股股东领取股息或凭证的时候，如果本人不能亲自来办理，可以委托别人代办，但被委托人必须持有委托人的委托证件。
    四、需要发给私股股东领息凭证的企业或专业公司，如果在七、八月发息前来不及做好发凭证的工作，可以先发息，以后再补办发凭证的手续。
    新华社29日讯　国务院在七月二十五日发出了关于新公私合营企业工资改革后新定计时工资标准一律从1956年七月一日起实行的通知。
    通知说：“在全行业公私合营以后实行公私合营的企业和由私营直接转为国营的企业、事业单位的工资改革问题，国务院已决定在八月上旬召开专门会议研究。现决定：新的工资方案不论在那一月份公布，新定的计时工资标准高于现行工资的部分，一律从1956年七月一日起补发。”
