    Salesman on the Borderline
    By our reporter Chen Yongjin
    This is the southernmost part of our country, Yunnan Province. Here, mountains are connected to mountains, and dense forests are connected to dense forests. Here, villages are sometimes hundreds of miles apart, and wild animals threaten the people. In these scattered villages live people of different languages and lifestyles, including the Dai, Aini, Han, and other ethnic minorities. Here, there is a young man loved by all ethnic groups—Bu Yuxuan. The girls here often take off Bu Yuxuan's hat to put flowers on it, and some girls simply embroider flowers on Bu Yuxuan's hat. Bu Yuxuan is a salesman, and he always asks people if they need anything. Bu Yuxuan will satisfy even the slightest requests of the people here. The people of Manmai Village say that we like Bu Yuxuan's trade group more than the flowers here.
    I interviewed Bu Yuxuan in Menghai—a small town in the southernmost part of Yunnan Province. Bu Yuxuan had just arrived at the trade company from Nan Nuo Mountain, sixty miles away. He was wearing faded green military trousers, with two large patches on the legs. His face was a little pale, and his body was also very thin. His Henan dialect was mixed with Yunnan's unique local expressions like "keshi" (but) "nayang" (what kind)... It is not difficult to imagine that Bu Yuxuan is a demobilized soldier.
    Our army liberated Bu Yuxuan's hometown of Song County, Henan Province, in 1947. His father joined the work team and was soon killed by the Kuomintang army. Bu Yuxuan buried his father, threw down his shepherd's whip, picked up a gun, and followed our army south. When the army came to these deep mountains inhabited by ethnic minorities, Bu Yuxuan often saw that the daily necessities of the people here came from foreign countries, even the salt they ate every day was foreign and very expensive. The leaders of the troops mobilized him to work locally, and the local comrades assigned him to the trade company and asked him to be the leader of the trade group. Bu Yuxuan was a little scared because he had not studied culture and was afraid that he would not be able to calculate accounts well and that he would not be able to manage money well. But who else could do it? At that time, the manager of the trade company said to him:
    "Trade work is a very important task of the Party. We must do it well. We must find ways to solve the needs of the masses, no matter how difficult it is. We must have a sufficient supply of labor tools and daily necessities for our fraternal ethnic groups, and we must let the masses buy things from their own country. Do you have any opinions on this work?"
    "I have no objections to whatever work the Party assigns me, but I can't keep accounts, and I'm afraid I'll cause losses to the Party's work."
    In June, the trade group composed of Bu Yuxuan, Ma Diandong, and Wang Zhengqiang was assigned to Daluo. As soon as Bu Yuxuan arrived in Daluo, he heard the bad news of tigers eating people. But what scared Bu Yuxuan was not the tiger but a batch of money given to them by the trade company. A person who has never managed so much money will not be so calm in his heart. At first, Bu Yuxuan hardly dared to leave the money, and he couldn't even sleep at night.
      The first problem Bu Yuxuan's trade group encountered when they arrived in Daluo was the lack of housing. They couldn't set up their stall, so they ran to the mountains to cut bamboo and build their own houses. After five or six days, the house was built, and they moved into their self-built bamboo and thatched house, feeling an indescribable sense of pleasure. But this pleasure was only fleeting. What stimulated the eyes of these trade comrades were the foreign goods in the market, those cloths, soaps... Salt cost five jiao per jin. The masses generally believed that their country was good, but it would not make anything. All ethnic groups looked at the staff expectantly, hoping that they would transport some goods to meet the needs that had never been met for generations. Bu Yuxuan surveyed the masses for two days. He wanted to know what the people in this mountain urgently needed? The district chief also convened a mass meeting for them.
    A few days later, they brought salt, cloth, cigarettes, rock candy, soap and blankets from the company, and they also brought noodles, chili peppers, vermicelli, and shredded radish, etc., filling the three thatched houses. These Chinese people who had never seen Chinese goods jumped and sang and ran to the trade group. The girls touched the colored cloth with satisfaction, and some people dipped a little salt in their hands and tasted it, and then smiled. Several loads of goods were quickly bought by the people. Dai youth Ai Kang said to Bu Yuxuan with emotion:
    "I really don't know that our country has so much salt and such good things."
    "Our country's sea salt is as big as a mountain," said Bu Yuxuan.
    Ai Kang was so excited that he couldn't speak for a while, and said very ashamed: "I really don't know enough about my own country!"
      Soon after Bu Yuxuan and others arrived in Daluo, the fraternal ethnic groups here were able to buy what they needed, and at the same time, they completed the task of purchasing cotton assigned by the superiors. Adults and children here like this trade group, and they especially like Bu Yuxuan. Because Bu Yuxuan is so loyal to people, no matter how you choose, he will not be bothered even if you change it a hundred times. Even if he is eating, if someone comes to buy something, he will immediately put down his bowl and give you something.
      During the days when Bu Yuxuan was in Daluo, tigers had eaten many people here. Because of this, people did not dare to buy things from afar. Don't look at Bu Yuxuan's gentle appearance, he is very brave and has a strong will. In the moonless night, he still walks alone in this deep mountain and dense forest. He doesn't know what fear is, what hardship is. One day, Bu Yuxuan went to find out about the new goods. He went from Daluo to the trade company one hundred and twenty miles away early in the morning. As soon as the sun came out, he walked on the mountain road between the weeds and shrubs that were more than one person deep. Suddenly, the roar of wild animals came from not far ahead. Bu Yuxuan looked up and saw that a big tiger was lying across the path. Bu Yuxuan walked over boldly, his eyes fixed on the tiger that looked like a calf. The tiger's eyes, like eggs, were also looking at Bu Yuxuan, as if they were both ready to fight. Bu Yuxuan held his revolver tightly and walked past the tiger from the grass layer five or six steps away. The tiger roared helplessly, stood up, wagged its tail, and walked away. Just when the fraternal ethnic groups in the Daluo area were suffering from tiger attacks and dared not come out, Bu Yuxuan and his trade group often went to the border line at night to check on illegal merchants smuggling foreign goods.
    In February 1953, Bu Yuxuan was sent to study. After studying for a few months, he was sent to Mengsong to establish a trade group. The fraternal ethnic groups in Mengsong, like the fraternal ethnic groups in Daluo, needed trade staff sent by the Communist Party.
  Before Bu Yuxuan came, he was afraid that he would not be able to find livestock to transport goods, but when he came to Mengsong, many Dai people said: Let's set up a trade group. How many horses do you want to carry things? Their business is expanding rapidly. The original small room was not enough, and the masses automatically helped build five more rooms. All this made Bu Yuxuan feel that he must better serve the fraternal ethnic groups in this mountain area. The people of Mengsong proposed to buy iron pots and blankets. The next day, Bu Yuxuan led the livestock to Jinghong to carry them. He saw that the hoes sold by private merchants were expensive, so he went to transfer hoes again. He knew that the Dai people needed red thread for weaving, the Aini people needed spinning knives and cotton blankets, and the Laji people needed homespun cloth. He respected the various ethnic groups here and learned ethnic languages. He could speak a few words of the languages of the fraternal ethnic groups living in Mengsong. Girls asked Bu Yuxuan to bring needles and thread and colored cloth; young men asked Bu Yuxuan to buy notebooks, pens, and ink for learning culture; people needed axes for chopping firewood and also looked for Bu Yuxuan. Sometimes, the transferred production tools were not suitable, so he found a blacksmith to process them. As long as the masses needed it, he would do everything possible to satisfy them.

    国境线上的售货员
    本报记者　陈勇进
    这是我们祖国云南省的南边，最南边。在这里，大山连着大山，密林连着密林。在这里，村庄有时相距百多里，野兽威胁着人们。在这疏落的村庄上住着语言不同，生活习惯不同的傣族、僾尼族、汉族人民和其他少数民族。在这里，有一个为各族人民所喜欢的青年人——卜育轩。这里的姑娘们常把卜育轩的帽子摘下来给他插上花儿，有的姑娘就干脆在卜育轩的帽子上绣个花儿。卜育轩是个售货员，他见了人总要问问缺不缺东西。对这里人们的一点微小的要求，卜育轩也会使他们得到满足。曼买村的群众说，我们喜欢卜育轩的贸易小组赛过这里的花儿。
    我访问卜育轩，是在勐海——云南省最南面的一个小镇子。卜育轩刚从六十里外的南糯山来到贸易公司里。他穿着褪色的绿军服裤，裤腿打着两个大补绽。他面孔有些苍白，身体也很消瘦，一口河南话里夹杂云南特有的土话什么“可是”“哪样”……。这不难想像卜育轩是个复员军人。
    我们的军队1947年把卜育轩的家乡河南嵩县解放了，他父亲参加了工作队，不久，被国民党军队杀了。卜育轩埋葬了父亲，丢下放羊的鞭子，拿起枪杆，随着我们的军队南下了。军队来到这少数民族聚居的深山里，卜育轩常看到这里人民日常用品都是从外国来的，连每天吃的盐也是外国来的，并且非常贵。部队领导同志动员他到地方上来工作，地方上的同志又把他分配到贸易公司里来，并且叫他到贸易小组里去当组长。卜育轩真有点害怕。因为他没学过文化，怕账算不好，怕钱管得不好。可是这又叫谁办呢，当时贸易公司的经理对他说：
    “贸易工作是党的非常重要的工作，我们一定要做好，群众需要的东西，不管多么困难也要想办法解决，一定要有充分的劳动工具和日用品供应兄弟民族，要叫群众买到自己国家的东西。你对这个工作有什么意见吗？”
    “党分配给我的啥工作都没意见，就是我不会上账算账，怕给党的工作造成损失。”
    六月间，卜育轩和马殿东、王正强组成的贸易小组被分配到打洛去了。卜育轩一来到打洛就听说老虎吃人的恶消息。可是使卜育轩害怕的不是老虎而是贸易公司交给他们一批钱。一个没管过这样多钱的人，他心里是不会那么平静的。开始，卜育轩几乎不敢离开那些钱，夜里连觉也睡不着。
      卜育轩的贸易小组来到打洛碰到的第一个问题就是没有房子。摊子摆不下来，他们就跑到山上砍竹子，自己盖房子。五、六天后房子盖起来了，他们搬到自己盖起的竹茅草房里，有一种说不出来的愉快味儿。可是这愉快只不过一闪就过去了，刺激这几位贸易工作同志眼睛的是集镇市场上的外国货，那些布匹、肥皂……食盐每斤要五角钱。群众普遍认为自己的国家好是好，就是不会制造什么东西。各兄弟民族眼巴巴地望着工作人员，盼望他们给运些货物来满足世世代代从没满足过的要求。卜育轩在群众中调查了两天，他要知道这大山里的人们迫切需要的是什么？区长还为他们召开了群众大会。
    几天后他们公司里驮来了盐、布、烟卷、冰糖、肥皂和毛毯，他们还驮来了挂面、辣椒、粉丝和萝卜丝等等，把三间茅草房摆得满满的。这些没有见过中国货的中国人们跳着唱着跑到贸易小组里来，姑娘们满意地摸着花布，有的人用手沾一点点盐放在嘴里尝，然后笑笑，几驮货物很快就给人们抢购完了。傣族青年艾康感动地对卜育轩说：
    “真不知道咱们的国家有这样多盐，有这样好的东西。”
    “咱们国家的海盐多得像山儿一样大，”卜育轩说。
    艾康那个青年激动得一时说不出话来，很惭愧地说：“自己对自己的国家实在太不了解啦！”
      卜育轩等来到打洛不久，就使这里的兄弟民族购买到自己需要的东西，同时还完成了上级收购棉花的任务。这里的大人孩子都喜欢这个贸易小组，其中特别喜欢卜育轩。因为卜育轩对人那个忠实劲儿，不管你怎样挑选，就是换一百次他也不嫌麻烦，就是他吃着饭，有人来买东西，他也会马上放下饭碗来给你拿东西。
      卜育轩在打洛的日子里，老虎曾在这里吃过很多的人。为这件事人们不敢到远处购买东西。别看卜育轩那个温温和和的劲儿，他的胆量很大，意志很坚强。在无月亮的深夜，他还独个儿在这深山密林里走路。他不知道什么是害怕，什么是艰难。有一天，卜育轩去了解新货物的情况，一早从打洛到一百二十里路外的贸易公司去。太阳刚出来，他在一人多深的荒草灌木间的山路上行走。忽然，在前面不远的地方传来野兽的吼叫。卜育轩抬头一看，原来是一只大虎横卧在小路上。卜育轩大胆地走过去，他的眼睛直盯着那只像牛儿样的老虎，老虎那对像鸡蛋样的眼睛也在看着卜育轩，好像都准备战斗一样。卜育轩手里紧握着左轮手枪从老虎北面五六步远的草层里走过去。老虎无奈何地吼叫了一声站起来摇着尾巴走了。就在打洛这一带兄弟民族遭受猛虎侵害而不敢出来的时候，卜育轩和他的贸易小组，经常在夜里在国境线上去检查私运外国货的不法商人。
    1953年2月，卜育轩被派去学习，学习了几个月，又被派到勐嵩去建立贸易小组。勐嵩这个地方的兄弟民族像打洛的兄弟民族一样，需要共产党派来的贸易工作人员。
  卜育轩未来前就怕找不到牲口运货物，可是当他来到勐嵩的时候，傣族的不少群众说：你们成立贸易小组吧，驮东西要多少马有多少马。他们的业务迅速地扩大着，原来的一间小屋子不够用，群众又自动地帮助盖了五间房子。这一切，都使卜育轩感到必须更好地为这带大山里的兄弟民族服务。勐嵩人们提出要买铁锅、毛毯，第二天卜育轩就牵着牲口到景洪去驮。他看到私商卖的锄头贵，就又去调锄头。他知道傣族织布要红线，僾尼族要旋刀、棉毯，拉基族要土布。他尊重这里的各兄弟民族，学习民族语言。他对居住在勐嵩的兄弟民族的语言，都会说几句。姑娘们缺少针线、花布叫卜育轩捎；青年小伙们学文化缺少日记本、钢笔、墨水，叫卜育轩买；人们需要砍柴的斧头也找卜育轩。有时候，调来的生产工具不合用，他就找铁匠加工。只要是群众需要的，他就想尽一切办法来满足。
