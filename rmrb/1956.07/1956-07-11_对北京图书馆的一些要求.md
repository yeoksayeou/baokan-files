    Some Requests for the Beijing Library

    Many scientists rely on the collection of the Beijing Library for their scientific research. However, the Beijing Library is currently unable to fully meet this need.

    The Beijing Library lacks important old books and periodicals. Although they have paid attention to collecting old books and periodicals that are not rare editions but are very useful for scientific research since liberation, judging from the "reference book" cards in the library, very few new books have been added. Some books are available on the market, but the Beijing Library does not have them. It is hoped that the Beijing Library will improve its work in this regard. For rare books that are not necessary to be reprinted by publishing houses for the time being, but are useful for scientific research and are not in the library's collection, it is hoped that they will be copied from other libraries.

    The Beijing Library has compiled and printed many kinds of catalogs, and these catalogs should be placed at the circulation desk for readers to consult. They have sorted out a large number of books, but readers cannot see the catalog of these books at the circulation desk. Indexes of clippings and reference materials for newspapers and periodicals are also not available in the newspaper and periodical reading room. At the borrowing place, only the catalog cards of new books are published, not those of old books. Old books are very useful for scientific research, and the catalog of old books that have been cataloged should also be published at any time.

    The Beijing Library indicates the main content of the book, the author's era, and his important resume on the catalog cards of some thread-bound books, which is very convenient for readers. It is hoped that necessary explanations will be universally added to this type of book.

    The Beijing Library stipulates that only three types of thread-bound books can be borrowed at a time, not exceeding fifteen volumes, which cannot satisfy those engaged in research work. Therefore, the restrictions on the number of types and especially the number of volumes of thread-bound books borrowed should be relaxed, and it should be allowed to continue borrowing books by submitting a request slip before returning the first batch of borrowed books, and then collecting the second batch of borrowed books after returning the first batch of books. The restrictions on the number of types and volumes of other books and periodicals borrowed should also be appropriately relaxed, and continuous requesting of books should also be allowed.

    Many newspapers and periodicals, especially those from the Qing Dynasty and the early Republic of China, and academic newspapers and periodicals, do not require a letter of introduction to borrow them. Like thread-bound books, they can be borrowed publicly. For the convenience of scientific research, it is also possible to consider re-examining books and periodicals that were previously considered non-circulating to see if there are any that can still be borrowed, and to allow borrowing in different ways by category.

    It is appropriate to carry out inter-library borrowing, but some books have been out for a long time and have not been returned, which affects the borrowing of readers who come to the library. It is necessary to establish necessary systems to take care of the needs of both parties. If a reader who comes to the library to borrow books finds that the required book has already been borrowed out, they can register the title of the book, and the library will retrieve it from outside the library for the next borrowing.

    Some readers come to the library from farther away to read books, often for a whole day. It is also appropriate for the Beijing Library to prepare a suitable place for readers to rest. In addition, the seats in the reading room are too crowded, and it is difficult to copy materials when reading thread-bound books. It is hoped that these problems will be solved.

### 对北京图书馆的一些要求

    对北京图书馆的一些要求
    不少的科学工作者在他们进行科学研究的时候，都指望着北京图书馆的藏书。但是北京图书馆现在还不能充分满足这方面的需要。
    北京图书馆缺少重要的旧书刊。解放以后他们虽然也注意搜集不是善本但在科学研究上很有用处的旧书刊，但从馆中“参考书”的卡片来看，新添的书很有限。有一些书，市场上有，北京图书馆却没有。希望北京图书馆改进这方面的工作。一些罕见而又一时没有必要由出版社重印的，而在科学研究上又有用处并且馆内无藏的书，希望他们从别的图书馆转钞过来。
    北京图书馆曾经编印了许多种书目，这些书目应该放在借书处让读者查阅。他们曾经整理出一大批书，但是读者在借书处却看不见这批书的目录。剪报资料目录和报刊参考资料索引在报刊阅览室也看不到。在借书的地方，只公布着新书编目卡片，没有旧书的。旧书对科学研究是很有用的，也应该随时公布已经编目的旧书目录。
    北京图书馆在一些线装书的编目卡片上注明了书的主要内容，作者时代及其重要履历等，对读者有很大方便，希望普遍地对这类书加以必要的说明。
    北京图书馆规定线装书每次只能借三种，不超过十五册，这对作研究工作的人不能满足。所以借阅线装书的种数特别是册数的限制应当放宽，并且允许在未还第一次借的书以前，交索书单继续借书，还清第一次借的书再领取第二次借的书。借阅其他书刊的种数，册数的限制也应适当放宽，并且也允许连续索书。
    许多报刊特别是清代和民国初年的报刊，学术性质的报刊，并不需要有介绍信才能借阅的制度，同线装书一样，完全可以公开借阅的。为了科学研究的方便，还可以考虑把过去认为不能出借的书刊重新审查，看其中是否有仍然可以出借的书刊，分门别类，通过不同的方式允许出借。
    开展馆际借书是应当的，但是有些书却长期在外面没有收回，影响来馆读者的借阅。应该建立必要的制度，照顾双方的需要。来馆借阅的读者如遇需要的书已经借出馆外，可以登记书名，由图书馆从馆外索回，下次借阅。
    有些读者是从较远的地方来馆看书的，往往一看就是一整天。北京图书馆为读者准备适当的休息地方也是应当的。这以外，阅览室的座位太拥挤，看线装书再想抄录材料就很困难。这类问题希望加以解决。
