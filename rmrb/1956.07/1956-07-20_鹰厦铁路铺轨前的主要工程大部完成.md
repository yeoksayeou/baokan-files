    Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: Major Works Completed Before Rail Laying on the Yingtan-Xiamen Railway

    According to Xinhua News Agency, the laying of tracks on the Yingtan-Xiamen Railway has exceeded 390 kilometers, advancing towards Yong'an County. Currently, 92% to 96% of the earthwork, tunnel, bridge, and culvert projects along the entire line have been completed. By the end of August, the major works before track laying, including roadbeds, bridges, culverts, and tunnels, can all be completed. This was stated to Xinhua News Agency reporters by the technical负责人 of the Railway Engineering Corps of the Chinese People's Liberation Army.

    The technical负责人 said that the Yingtan-Xiamen Railway has an extremely large number of tunnels, culverts, and large-scale cut slope projects. In some project sections, tunnels, bridges, and large-scale filling and excavation works are closely connected. The earthwork of the entire line averages more than 90,000 cubic meters per kilometer. In the Daiyun Mountain area of central Fujian, within a 50-kilometer section, it averages 174,000 cubic meters per kilometer. In one place, a one-kilometer-long section of the line has a total earthwork volume of up to 610,000 cubic meters. In some places, it is necessary to split a mountain in half or dig away half of it for the railway to pass through. The construction of this railway is one of the most arduous railway projects currently underway in the country. However, thanks to the efforts of all the soldiers, workers, and technicians, and the support of the people from various regions, these difficulties have been overcome or are being overcome. The progress of the project is far ahead of the original planned speed, and it is expected that the entire line can be opened to traffic by the end of this year, one year ahead of schedule.

    Due to the initiative and creativity of the construction troops, workers, and technicians, constantly improving the engineering design based on the actual situation, avoiding and opposing blind construction, the construction time has been greatly shortened, the amount of work has been reduced, and a large amount of national wealth has been saved.

    The technical负责人 concluded by saying that the brilliant prospects of the motherland's railway construction have greatly encouraged the construction enthusiasm of the officers and soldiers of the Railway Engineering Corps. The officers and soldiers are very enthusiastic about learning advanced experience and improving their technical level. Everyone is determined to build more and better railways for the motherland.

    鹰厦铁路铺轨前的主要工程大部完成
    据新华社讯　鹰潭—厦门铁路铺轨已经超过三百九十公里，向永安县城推进。全线的土石方、隧道、桥梁、涵洞工程，目前已分别完成92％到96％。到八月底，铺轨前的主要工程，包括路基、桥梁、涵洞、隧道等都可以全部完成。这是中国人民解放军铁道兵技术负责人对新华社记者说的。
    技术负责人说，鹰厦铁路的隧道、涵洞和大劈方工程数量十分巨大。在有些工程地段，隧道、桥梁、大填挖方工程等紧密相连。全线土石方工程平均每公里九万多立方公尺。在福建中部戴云山区五十公里内，平均每公里达十七万四千立方公尺。有一处一公里长的线路，土石方工程总量高达六十一万立方公尺。有些地方必须把一座山劈为两半或者挖掉一半，铁路才能通过去。这条铁路的工程是现在国内铁路建设中最艰巨的工程之一。但是，依靠全体军工、民工和技术人员的努力和各地人民的支援，这些困难已经被克服或者正在被克服，工程进展远远超过原订计划速度向前进展，预计可以提前一年在今年年底全线通车。
    由于施工部队、民工和技术人员发挥主动性和创造性，根据实际情况，不断改善工程设计，避免和反对盲目施工，大大缩短了施工时间，减少了工程数量，并且为国家节省了大量的资财。
    技术负责人最后说，祖国铁路建设的光辉远景，大大地鼓舞了铁道兵部队官兵的建设热情。军官和士兵们学习先进经验、提高技术水平的热情很高，大家都决心为祖国修建更多更好的铁路。
