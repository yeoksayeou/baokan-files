    Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, 30th -- Polish Premier Cyrankiewicz delivered a radio address on the Poznan events on June 29th on Poznan Radio.
    Cyrankiewicz said: This kind of provocation and disturbance shocked the conscience of every honest Poznan resident and every Pole, and was met with the full condemnation of the public.
    We are telling the truth, and there is no need to conceal the fact: Sinister provocateurs took advantage of the discontent that undoubtedly existed in some factories due to economic difficulties and various, often vexing shortcomings.
    As for the dissatisfaction manifested in some factories in Poznan, which was obviously caused by mistakes and by the incorrect implementation of binding regulations, these mistakes must obviously be corrected, and will be corrected immediately, especially since the government and the Party received a delegation of workers a few days ago and satisfied their legitimate demands.
    Imperialist organizations have long had their eye on Poznan, and they wanted to turn Poznan, the city hosting the international fair, into a place where riots occurred during the fair. This kind of thing did not happen by accident.
    Cyrankiewicz said: The Party Central Committee and the government have formulated an implementation plan that will gradually improve the living standards of the working masses. Those working people with particularly low incomes will be considered first. This is the task we must do our best to accomplish.
    However, if the purpose of the Poznan workers was undoubtedly to make their demands—which is their right—then the saboteurs and imperialist agents were considering the exact opposite. They wanted to make these demands impossible to realize—which they will not succeed in doing—and they also hoped to create a state of anarchy that would also hinder the process of democratizing our lives that is underway. The democratization of life is what imperialist agents fear most. Therefore, once the vast majority of the working class understood this and broke away from and withdrew from the second stage of the demonstration, and refused to participate in the despicable conspiracy of agents and provocateurs carrying weapons to attack public buildings, it is not surprising that these aims of the perpetrators could not be achieved. Therefore, this is no longer a question of workers' criticism, nor of more or less legitimate demands, it has become a question of saboteurs instigating armed attacks against the people's regime, against state buildings, against the police and public security personnel. Therefore, apart from a few deceived workers, the working masses naturally support the people's regime, their own regime.
    Cyrankiewicz said: The imperialist agents hope to plunge the entire Poland into the abyss, and then repeat the tragedy suffered by the heroic residents of Poznan during the Nazi offensive. "The blood shed in Poznan should be borne by the enemy, by the imperialist organizations opposing Poland and the underground reactionary forces that directly instigated this riot. However, the bloody riot in Poznan will never stop or weaken the efforts of the Party and the government to democratize our lives and to better carry out our tasks with the utmost care and to promote the country's economic and cultural development and to improve the living conditions of the working people as quickly as possible.
    In these efforts, the Party and the People's Government believe that they will surely receive the full support of the entire public, and all the working people of Poznan will surely consciously fulfill their responsibilities."
    Cyrankiewicz emphasized that we can tell every provocateur or mentally disturbed person who dares to raise a hand against the people's regime that their hand will be cut off.
    Cyrankiewicz finally called on the citizens of Poznan to fully support the people's regime in this difficult and painful moment to eliminate the shortcomings that can be eliminated today, and called on you to assist in eliminating the shortcomings that can be eliminated tomorrow through our joint efforts, to make our economy more effective, and to improve the living conditions of the masses.

    西伦凯维兹就波兹南事件发表演说
    揭露帝国主义和反动势力阴谋制造混乱
    相信党和政府一定得到全体人民的支持
    新华社华沙30日电　波兰部长会议主席西伦凯维兹，六月二十九日就波兹南事件在波兹南广播电台发表了广播演说。
    西伦凯维兹说：这种挑衅和骚动震惊了每一个正直的波兹南居民和每一个波兰人的良心，受到了公众的全力谴责。
    我们说老实话，一点也没有必要掩饰这个事实：罪恶的挑拨分子利用了在某些工厂中由于经济困难和各种往往是令人着恼的缺点而无疑存在的不满情绪。
    至于波兹南有些工厂中表现出来的显然由于错误和由于不正确地实行约束性条例而引起了不满，这种错误显然必须予以纠正，而且将立即予以纠正，特别是因为政府和党在几天前接见了工人代表团，满足了它们的正当要求。
    帝国主义组织长期以来就看中了波兹南，他们要想把举行国际博览会的城市波兹南变成在举行博览会期间发生骚乱的地方。这种事情并不是偶然发生的。
    西伦凯维兹说：党中央委员会和政府已经拟定了一个实施方案，这个方案将逐步提高劳动群众的生活水平。凡是收入特别少的那些劳动人民将首先得到考虑。我们要竭尽全力完成的就是这个任务。
    可是，如果说，波兹南工人的目的无可怀疑地是要提出他们的要求——这是他们的权利，那么破坏分子和帝国主义特务所考虑的是完全相反的。他们想使这些要求不能实现——这是他们不会成功的事——而且他们还希望造成一种无政府状态，这种状态还将使正在实现中的使我们生活民主化的过程受到阻碍。生活民主化是帝国主义特务所最恐惧的事。因此，一旦工人阶级中绝大多数人明白这一点以后脱离和退出第二阶段的示威，拒绝参加携带武器袭击公共建筑物的特务和挑拨分子的卑鄙阴谋，肇事者的这些目的就无法达到，这并不是令人惊奇的。因此，这不再是工人们的批评问题了，也不是或多或少是正当的要求了，这已经成了一个破坏分子策动的反对人民政权的、对国家建筑物、对民警和公安人员进行武装袭击的问题了。因此，除了个别被骗的工人以外，工人群众自然支持人民政权、支持他们自己的政权。
    西伦凯维兹说：帝国主义特务希望使整个波兰陷入深渊，然后使英勇的波兹南居民在纳粹进攻期间遭受到的悲剧再次重演。“波兹南所流的血，应该由敌人，由反对波兰的帝国主义组织和直接策动这次骚乱的地下反动势力负责。然而，波兹南的流血暴动决不会停止或削弱党和政府为了使我们生活民主化和用最大的关心来更好地执行我们的任务和促进全国的经济和文化发展以及使劳动人民的生活条件得到最迅速的改善而进行的努力。
    在这些努力中，党和人民政权相信一定会得到全体公众的充分支持，波兹南全体劳动人民一定也会自觉地完成他们的责任。”
    西伦凯维兹强调说，我们可以明白告诉每一个胆敢举手反对人民政权的挑拨分子或是神经失常的人，他们的手将被砍断。
    西伦凯维兹最后号召波兹南公民们在这个困难和痛心的时刻充分支持人民政权消灭今天已经能够消除的缺点，号召你们协助消除那些靠我们的共同努力明天就能消灭的缺点，使得我们的经济更加有效，使得广大群众生活条件有所改善。
