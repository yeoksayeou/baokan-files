Xinhua News Agency report: The All-China Association for Science and Technology Popularization invited responsible persons from local popular science associations attending the Third Session of the First National People's Congress to a forum in Beijing on the 1st, to solicit their opinions on popular science work.

    Liang Xi, Chairman of the All-China Association for Science and Technology Popularization, introduced the main work of the Association in the past six months. Afterwards, popular science workers from various places raised the following questions and suggestions:

    Farmers urgently need scientific and technological knowledge related to agricultural production increase, but popular science work in some areas cannot meet the farmers' needs. For example, farmers in Jiangxi Province raised many scientific and technological questions that popular science workers cannot answer; the quality of scientific knowledge lectures is not high enough, and they are not easy to understand; there is a lack of visualized publicity materials, such as slides, films, and wall charts; in some places, trade union organizations and Party and government departments do not pay enough attention to and understand popular science work, and local popular science organizations are not adequately striving for leadership from all sides; the problems of funding, staffing, and cadre quality of local popular science organizations have not been well resolved; the work of leveraging the enthusiasm of members has not been done well; the experience of popular science work has not been well summarized. They hope that the All-China Association for Science and Technology Popularization will compile and produce more nationally applicable publicity materials on basic scientific knowledge, such as lecture scripts and slides; local popular science associations can compile more publicity materials tailored to local conditions, and strengthen the exchange of publicity materials and work experience compiled by various places themselves.

    More than 20 people attended this forum, including responsible persons and committee members of popular science associations from 12 provinces and cities, including Anhui, Jiangxi, Shanxi, Liaoning, Beijing, Tianjin, and Anshan, as well as standing committee members of the All-China Association for Science and Technology Popularization.

    出席人代会会议的部分科学家
    座谈科学普及工作
    据新华社讯　中华全国科学技术普及协会一日邀集出席第一届全国人民代表大会第三次会议的各地科普协会负责人在北京举行座谈会，征求他们对科学普及工作的意见。
    全国科普协会主席梁希在会上介绍了全国科普协会半年来的主要工作以后，各地科普工作者分别提出了下列一些问题和建议：
    农民十分需要农业增产方面的科学技术知识，但有些地方的科普工作不能满足农民的要求，例如江西省农民提出了许多科学技术问题，科普工作者不能解答；科学知识讲演的质量还不高，不通俗；缺少形象化的宣传材料，如幻灯片、电影、挂图等；有的地方的工会组织和党政部门对科普工作的重视和了解还不够，同时地方科普组织争取各方面的领导也不够；地方科普组织的经费、人员编制和干部质量问题还没有很好地解决；发挥会员积极性的工作做得不够；没有很好地总结科普工作经验。他们希望全国科普协会更多地编写和制作全国通用的基础科学知识方面的宣传资料，如讲演稿、幻灯片等；地方科普协会可以多编写因地制宜的宣传资料，并且加强交流各地自己编写的宣传资料和工作经验。
    出席这个座谈会的有安徽、江西、山西、辽宁、北京、天津、鞍山等十二个省、市的科普协会负责人和委员以及全国科普协会常务委员等共二十多人。
