    About Pandas
    Zhou Jianren
    There are pandas in the Beijing Western Suburban Zoo. It is a long-famous animal. People love to watch it, and there are often people surrounding it. It is a plump, bear-like animal, with creamy (white) fur. The front of the ears is black. There are black circles around each eye. The shoulders and legs are also black. But some individuals have chestnut-colored reddish hues. It is also called the giant panda.
    It lives in western China. According to zoologists, it lives by eating bamboo shoots, bamboo leaves, and branches. Although it belongs to the carnivore order systematically, it does not eat meat. Since it is a carnivore, its ancestors must have eaten meat. When did it become a vegetarian? And for what reason? We do not yet know these things.
    According to investigators, the locals call it "white bear." This name is also accurate because its fur is mostly white, and its shape resembles a bear. But we now call polar bears white bears, and the two names are easily confused. Now we generally call it panda, not white bear. Mr. Fu Yunsen, the compiler of the Ci Yuan dictionary and a very well-read scholar, once told me that the ancient term "Pixiu" probably referred to this animal. Although he was not entirely certain when he said it, I might as well record it here.
    There is also a kind of panda that is much smaller than it, a little bigger than a cat, and its shape is like a raccoon, very much like a cat, and it can also climb trees. The fur is reddish-brown, with white around the ears. There are several white patches on its face. The legs and feet are black. The tail is reddish-brown with black rings. It also lives in western China, and its food is mainly bamboo, but it also likes to eat lichen growing on trees. It also belongs to the carnivore order, but now we do not know why it does not eat meat anymore. I heard that its local name is called nine-section wolf. Nine sections, because its tail has black rings, forming sections. As for the word wolf, I don't know how it was added, because its shape does not look like a wolf, but like a cat. It is called the lesser panda, to distinguish it from the relatively large giant panda.
    The scientific name of the giant panda is Ailuropoda melanoleuca, David. The scientific name of the lesser panda is Aelurus fulgens styani, Thomas. Earlier zoological classifications placed the giant panda in the bear family and the lesser panda in the raccoon family. In recent years, there has been a tendency to separate them and establish a lesser panda family.
    Both of these animals are very interesting. Their shape and fur color are very beautiful, and everyone likes to watch them. Their nature is very gentle, and children are not afraid to watch them at all. Also, these two animals are relatively rare, so they are considered very precious. The giant panda is especially famous.
    These animals also have a use, which is that studying them can increase the spirit of respecting objective facts. Studying natural sciences generally has this effect, and what is particularly noteworthy about studying pandas is that although it is listed in the carnivore order, it does not eat meat. If you rely on common sense, you will inevitably make mistakes. Everyone hears the name carnivore and always thinks that the animals included are all meat-eaters. Originally, the nature of carnivores is various: tigers, leopards, cats, etc. love to eat fresh meat. Dogs also eat spoiled meat. Bears are omnivorous, eating meat, as well as fruits, tubers, and other plant matter. As for pandas, they are completely vegetarian.
    Studying natural phenomena in the field greatly helps to reduce arbitrary and dogmatic thinking, and to cultivate the idea and style of handling things realistically. The ancients saw that the Guo Luo (a kind of wasp) captured small green caterpillars and sealed them in mud houses, and then said that they were hatched into their own offspring; later, Hao Yixing in his Erya Yishu quoted the words of field observers, pointing out that the Guo Luo captured the small green caterpillars to feed the larvae, not to hatch them into their own offspring. Hao said that the words of hatching into one's own offspring came from "the ancients' observation of things was not precise, and they measured things rashly." To avoid measuring things rashly, the only way is to be precise in observing things; here, being lazy and opportunistic, taking words at face value, and pretending to know what one does not know will not help in the slightest.
    Studying natural science can mainly obtain correct knowledge, but there is no doubt that it can also exercise thinking. (Attached picture)

    关于熊猫
    周建人
    北京西郊动物园中有熊猫。它是久已著名的动物。人们很喜欢看它，常常有人在围着看。它是胖胖的体形像熊的动物，毛色呈乳脂色（白色）。耳朵前方黑色。两眼各有一黑色圈。肩部及腿也是带黑色的。但有些个体带栗壳色的赤色。它又叫大熊猫。
    它生长在我国的西部，据动物学者说，它是吃竹笋、竹叶及其枝生活的。虽然它系统上属于食肉类，却不吃肉。它既然是食肉类，它的祖先一定是吃肉的，什么时候变为素食主义者的呢？又由于什么原因呢？这些我们却还没有知道。
    据调查者说，本地人叫它“白熊”。这名称也对，因为它的体毛大部分呈白色，形态又像熊的缘故。但我们现在称北极熊为白熊，两个名称容易相混淆，现在就通叫它熊猫，不叫它白熊了。辞源的编者、读书极广博的傅运森先生曾经对我说过，古时候所谓貔貅大概便是指这动物。他说时虽没有十分断定，但这里不妨记一笔。
    还有一种熊猫比它小得多，比猫则大些，体形像浣熊，很有点像猫，也能爬树。毛色赤褐，耳边白色。脸上有几块白色斑。腿与脚黑色。尾赤褐色，有黑色环纹。它也生长在我国西部，食物也以竹为主，但又喜欢吃树上生长着的须状的地衣。它也属于食肉类，但现在也不知道为什么，也已不吃肉了。听说它的本地方的名字叫做九节狼。九节，由于它的尾巴有黑色环纹，成一节节的形状，至于狼字不知怎样加上去的，因为它的形状并不像狼，却像猫。它叫小熊猫，以别于前一种比较巨大的大熊猫。
    大熊猫学名叫 A iluropoda melanoleuca，David。小熊猫学名叫A elurus fulgens styani，Thomas。早一些时候的动物学分类，把大熊猫归在熊科里，小熊猫归在浣熊科里，近年有把它们独立出来，成立一个小熊猫科的倾向。
    这两种动物都很有意思，体形、毛色都很好看，大家喜欢看；性质很和善，小孩看了一点不害怕。又这两种动物比较稀少，所以被看作很珍贵。大熊猫更特别著名些。
    这些动物还有一种用处，是研究它们可以增加尊重客观事实的精神。研究自然科学一般都有这一种作用，而研究熊猫的特别可说的地方，就在它虽然列名在食肉类，却并不吃肉，如果靠常识判断，就难免犯错误。大家听了食肉类这名称，总以为所包含的动物都是吃肉的。原来食肉类动物的性质有各种不同：虎，豹，猫等爱吃鲜肉。狗则腐败点的肉类也吃。熊是杂食的，肉也吃，又吃果实、块根等植物质。至于熊猫，竟完全吃素了。
    实地研究自然现象，大有助于减少随意武断，和培养实事求是地处理事情的思想和作风。古人看到果蠃（一种细腰蜂）把小青虫捕去，封在泥房里，遂说是孵育为己子的；后来郝懿行在尔雅义疏里，引证实地观察者的话，指出果蠃把小青虫捕去是供给幼虫食用的，并非孵育成为己子。郝说，孵育成己子的话是由于“古人察物未精，妄为测量”而来。要不妄为测量，唯一的办法就是精于察物；在这里，偷懒取巧，望文生义，强不知以为知，是不会有丝毫帮助的。
    研究自然科学，主要可以获得正确的知识，但毫无疑义，也可以锻练思想。（附图片）
