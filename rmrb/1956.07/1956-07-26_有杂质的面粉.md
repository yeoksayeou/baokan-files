Reader's Letters:

    Flour with Impurities
    When the Shijiazhuang Flour Mill was implementing the state's grain processing policy of "increasing purity and reducing refinement," it only emphasized the aspect of reducing refinement to increase the flour yield, while neglecting the aspect of increasing purity, resulting in a gradual decline in product quality. The flour recently transferred from this factory to Tangshan was dark greenish in color, with the bran content reaching twenty-seven taels per bag, and it also contained a large amount of sand and other impurities.

    有杂质的面粉
    石家庄面粉厂在执行国家“提高纯度、降低精度”的粮食加工政策的时候，只强调降低精度提高出粉率的一面，忽视了提高纯度的一面，产品质量逐步下降。这个厂最近调往唐山的面粉颜色青暗，含麸量每袋达到二十七两，里面还有大量砂石等杂质。　（左李、路张）
