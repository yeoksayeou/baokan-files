Also Discussing "A Word Worth a Thousand Gold Pieces"
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Zhù Jiā

    Mr. Feng Qiyong published an article entitled "'A Word Worth a Thousand Gold Pieces' Saying" in the "Literary Gazette" No. 9, 1956, which was about Lü Buwei and the "Lüshi Chunqiu." He began by quoting the "Biography of Lü Buwei" from the "Records of the Grand Historian," from "Lü Buwei then had his guests each write down what they had heard" to "Whoever can add or subtract a single word will be given a thousand gold pieces." Then he said:

　　How Lü Buwei as a person should be
　　evaluated, we will not concern ourselves with that for now.
　　Just looking at him using the resource of a thousand gold, extensively soliciting others'
　　strict criticisms of his and his retainers' works,
　　this spirit is commendable.
　　No wonder it is still passed down as a beautiful story after thousands of years.

    I think this attitude of discussing issues is worth studying. First, how can we separate our view of a person's behavior from the evaluation of the entire person? Second, we cannot simply look at the surface of the issue of "'Whoever can add or subtract a single word will be given a thousand gold pieces'" without asking about the motivation and then conclude that his humility is commendable. Third, is something necessarily a beautiful story just because it has been passed down for thousands of years?

    The reasons I dare not agree with Mr. Feng are: First, why did Lü Buwei ask his retainers to write books for him, calling them "Lüshi Chunqiu"? Second, what was the purpose of offering a reward of a thousand gold pieces in the Xianyang market? Third, why didn't anyone change a single word?

    According to the "Biography of Lü Buwei" in the "Records of the Grand Historian," he rose from a great merchant to the high-ranking official of Qin, addressed as "Second Father." He emulated the actions of Lord Xinling, Lord Pingyuan, and Lord Mengchang by harboring guests. He was like "Xun Qing and his disciples, who wrote books and spread them throughout the world," having his guests write more than 200,000 words, calling them "Lüshi Chunqiu."

    My view on this matter is: Lü Buwei was a great conspirator who gained a high position through trickery. He had nothing in common with people who were humble and discussed scholarship. He himself could not write books, but he had others write books for him while he enjoyed the fame. That "posting in the market gate of Xianyang" was undoubtedly for fame and self-promotion. He was a man of means, and such large-scale use of original advertising techniques could, of course, be passed down for a long time. A thousand gold pieces is a great reward! Surely brave men will come forth under a great reward. Why does history not record anyone changing a single word and receiving a thousand gold pieces? Of course, this would not happen! What kind of environment was Qin at that time? With his red-hot power and influence, who would dare to change even a single word of his? He saw this very clearly. I think it is much more reasonable to say that he was "arrogant and complacent," because he was boasting about "his work"!

    Chairman Mao also told us in "On Contradiction": "In studying problems, one must avoid subjectivity, one-sidedness, and superficiality." It is impossible to be correct in commenting on the ancients if we violate this truth.

    也谈“一字千金”
    祝嘉
    冯其庸先生在“文艺报”1956年第九号上发表了一篇“‘一字千金’说”，是说吕不韦和“吕氏春秋”的。他开头是引“史记”的“吕不韦列传”，从“吕不韦乃使其客人人著所闻”，到“有能增损一字者予千金。”接着就说：
        吕不韦这个人，应该如何
    评价，我们现在且不去管他。
    单看他以千金之资，广征别人
    对他及他的门客的著作以严格
    的批评，这种精神，是可取的。
    无怪乎千载以后，仍传为美谈。
    我想这种谈问题的态度，是值得研究的。第一、我们对一个人的行为的看法，怎么能和他整个人的评价分开呢？第二、“有能增损一字者予千金。”也不能不问动机而从表面上看问题，就认为他虚怀若谷是可取的。第三、传之千载，一定是美谈吗？
    我所以不敢苟同于冯先生的，是：第一，吕不韦为什么要叫门下客为他著书，名曰“吕氏春秋”？第二，在咸阳市上悬千金之赏，是为了什么？第三，又为什么没有人去改一个字？
    据“史记”“吕不韦列传”所载，他是从一个大贾而做到秦相国，称“仲父”的大官僚，他是慕信陵、平原、孟尝之所为而蓄宾客的，他是“如荀卿之徒著书布天下”，而使其客著书二十余万言，称曰“吕氏春秋”的。
    我对这一事的看法是：吕不韦是一个大阴谋家，以险诈取得高位，和虚怀若谷而谈学问的人，没有相通之处。他自己并不能著书，但是却叫别人为他著书而自己享名。那“布咸阳市门”无疑是为了名为了自我宣传。他是有手段的人，这样大规模地运用独创的广告术，当然可以传之久远了。千金，重赏也！重赏之下，必有勇夫，何以史上并不记载有人去改过一个字而取得千金呢？这当然是不会有的！当时的秦国，是怎样一个环境呢？他那炙手可热的权势，谁敢去改他一个字呢？这一层，他是看得很清楚的。我以为说他是“骄傲自满”，还合理得多；因为他正在夸耀“他的著作”啦！
    毛主席在“矛盾论”上也告诉我们：“研究问题，忌带主观性、片面性和表面性。”违背了这个真理而去评论古人，是不会正确的。
