    To the East for Construction
    Over 100,000 Soviet Youths Embark on New Jobs

    Moscow Dispatch from our Newspaper, July 27th – Hundreds of thousands of Soviet youths have enthusiastically responded to the call of their Party and government to go to the East for construction. This was stated by Zaruzhny, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Soviet Komsomol, to reporters at the Press Club on the 26th. He said that this year, 210,000 youths will participate in new construction projects. Currently, there are still more than 5,000 applicants in Ukraine, 2,400 applicants in Belarus, more than 4,000 in Azerbaijan, 6,500 in Georgia, and more than 3,700 in the Moscow region and Moscow. More than 100,000 people have already arrived at various construction sites. About 40,000 Ukrainian youths have gone to the mines and construction sites of Donbass, more than 4,000 have arrived in Kazakhstan, and more than 2,000 youths from Moscow and Leningrad have begun working in Norilsk. These include workers, staff members, demobilized soldiers, vocational school students, and high school graduates.

    Zaruzhny said that the Soviet Party and government are very concerned about the young people participating in the new construction and have prepared all necessary equipment for them. For example, the Ministry of Commerce has organized a commercial network in the areas where the youths are going, establishing shops, canteens, etc. The Ministry of Health has established many medical institutions for the youths and sent a large number of medical personnel. The Ministry of Culture has organized performance groups, opened cinemas there, prepared mobile projectors, and transported a large number of books and reading materials.

    In addition, the government has also stipulated many preferential policies for them, such as issuing temporary subsidies. The youths are warmly welcomed everywhere.

    At the press conference, young engineer Yermolov and young nursery worker Chebakina spoke about the comfortable conditions they had in Moscow, but patriotism inspired them to go to places where construction was needed. Chebakina said that although she loves children very much, in order to participate in the country's new construction, she is prepared to learn new technologies and participate in assembly work at the Irkutsk factory.
