    Not Yet Twisted Into One Rope
    Jian Hong
    The Hongqi Agricultural Production Cooperative in Zhuozhou County, Hebei Province, has a total of 1,914 households and nearly 30,000 mu of land, divided into 28 production teams. This cooperative was formed last winter by merging small, elementary cooperatives from three townships and six villages into an advanced cooperative.
    Judging from the summer harvest distribution and current production, this cooperative is doing reasonably well. Despite heavy rains, tight schedules, and over one hundred laborers working elsewhere (flood prevention and supporting construction sites) this year, agricultural tasks such as pest control, summer harvesting, summer planting, thinning, and weeding were not delayed. According to the preliminary distribution plan and the actual wheat harvest, 90.9% of the cooperative members increased their income compared to last year's wheat season, generally by 25%, with the highest increase reaching 30%. An average able-bodied laborer can receive approximately 300 jin of wheat.
    Although the harvest is not bad, some cooperative members' thinking is somewhat unstable. This cooperative needs to solve many important problems to move forward. The most important problem is that the leadership and members of the entire cooperative are still working with several different forces; these forces have not yet been truly twisted into one solid rope.
    After the cooperatives merged, the main cadres from each township and small cooperative came together, which should have greatly strengthened the leadership. However, this has not really strengthened it much. Although the leadership structure appears to be centralized, the strength of the cadres has not been concentrated. The cadres' thinking is very inconsistent. Cadres from a particular township favor that township; cadres who were originally in a particular small cooperative only care about the team that small cooperative was reorganized into. The teams often distrust each other and bicker.
    With the merger of the cooperatives, the form of the Party's grassroots organization has changed, and a unified general branch committee has been established. Under the guidance of the district committee, Liu Dexiang, the original township branch secretary, was selected to serve as the general branch secretary. At that time, the Party members from the various townships did not understand each other, and the selection was not appropriate; now, other branch committee members are not convinced. Therefore, they not only do not respect the leadership, but also deliberately find fault with the general branch secretary. In this situation, it is difficult for Liu Dexiang to exert his initiative. Some cooperative cadres (Party members) have localism in their thinking and falsely report labor work points; there are also individual Party members who stole wheat while guarding the fields. The general branch has not dealt with these serious problems.
    After the townships merged, the thirteen township cadres from the three townships gathered together. However, they have not played their due role. The township cadres push many of their responsibilities (delivering public grain, giving preferential treatment to military families, etc.) to the agricultural cooperative cadres. The township cadres have been idle with nothing to do, while the cooperative cadres are overwhelmed.
    The leadership of the Agricultural Production Cooperative Management Committee is relatively strong; however, because it handles too many and too miscellaneous matters, it has not done its own work well. Many cooperative cadres spend most of their energy on complex administrative affairs. They are constantly being sought by people from this township or that team; one moment they are resolving disputes, the next moment they are solving livelihood problems. The eleven cadres are barely able to cope with these matters alone; many problems in production and members' thinking cannot be solved in a timely manner. The cooperative cadres' thinking is also inconsistent. Although the Management Committee includes members elected by the members of each village, the members from Songlindian Township, which originally had a better foundation, are more numerous and capable, and dominate the leadership. These cadres have some prejudice against the work and cadres of other villages; they do not unite well with the cadres of each township and village, and give more criticism and blame. They do not provide enough concrete help to Fangshu Township, which has a poorer work foundation, and simply say that Fangshu Township is "backward" in this and "bad" in that. Therefore, some antagonistic emotions have arisen among the cadres. It is difficult for the Management Committee to reach a consensus when dealing with any problem or making any decision; even if a decision is made, it cannot be well implemented. This spring, the Management Committee called for pest control, some teams implemented it quickly, while others delayed. Some old members reflected: "The big cooperative has so many cadres, but it is not as good as the leadership of the small cooperative. This year is much looser than last year, and some members don't go to the fields for several days, and no one cares."
    Now, in order to overcome localism, the cooperative cadres have swapped the teams originally led by the various Management Committee members. This does not solve the problem ideologically and does not actually avoid localism; instead, it is more detrimental to the work. This exchange makes the cadres unfamiliar with the situation; although some cooperative cadres have arrived in the teams, they cannot delve deeply into the work because they are unfamiliar with the situation.
    Team-based and township-based thinking not only exists among the cadres but is also common among the members. The members of each team only say that their own team is good, and only want to find fault with other teams; mutual learning and assistance are very poor. They rush to do beneficial things in their own team and always want to push unprofitable things outward. This year, many people in the townships that did not suffer wheat losses (mostly high ground) are complaining that they bore the losses of other townships. They did not see that the increased grain harvested after the paddy fields were converted in the low-lying areas would also be distributed uniformly, nor did they see that no matter which piece of land produced wheat, it actually contained the labor of all the members and the production funds of the entire cooperative. These ideas are clearly hindering the consolidation and development of the cooperative. However, some local cadres have not paid due attention to this issue.
    The historical conditions and work foundation of each village and team are different, the ability and experience of the cadres are different, and the class composition and ideological awareness of the members are different. Therefore, the production conditions between teams and groups are also very different. For example, Teams 15 and 16 have almost the same land and labor force, but the growth of the seedlings is very different.
    Team 16 is mostly made up of hired laborers and is a very good team. A few days ago, some members of some teams saw that some of the land was waterlogged and the wheat suffered a little damage, and their morale declined. However, the morale of many members in Team 16 has remained very good. This team also has relatively good methods in labor management. They appropriately adjusted the unreasonable labor remuneration standards according to the specific situation of agricultural work in the team. After careful study, they reduced the scores that were set too high and increased those that were set too low. The total number of work points contracted by the team from the Management Committee did not change, but the distribution within the team was more reasonable. The members of the team are very satisfied with this, feeling that they do not lose out no matter what work they do, and they will do whatever they are asked to do. The team has strict regulations: work is recorded every day, and no backlog is allowed. They also have a good grasp of the land and agricultural work, dividing all the land into three categories: far, middle, and near. Within each category of land, they further divide it into many plots of roughly the same size according to the number of groups and the crop cultivation situation. Each plot is marked with the number of mu, what is planted, and numbered with a wooden sign. The captain and group leaders have detailed registration forms; when the several group leaders and the captain meet, they can quickly arrange the agricultural work, and can arrange several days of work at once. Therefore, this team has fewer and shorter meetings, and production is fast and good. If we carefully study and summarize the experience of this team and promote it to all teams in the cooperative, what a great role it would play! However, many local cadres only see that this team has fewer meetings, and this team is also unwilling to participate in many cooperative meetings, so they say that this team "lacks politics."
    It is not surprising that some production teams are doing better and some are doing worse. If the cooperative cadres are united and the teams can learn from each other, learning from each other's strengths to offset their weaknesses, any good experience of any team can become the wealth of the entire cooperative. It is just that the cadres of the entire cooperative lack collectivist spirit, and the teams not only do not learn from each other but also exclude each other. The local small interests have blinded their eyes, and they cannot see the huge interests of the entire cooperative.

    还没有拧成一根绳

    河北涿县的红旗农业生产合作社，共有一千九百一十四户，近三万亩土地，分了二十八个生产队。这个社是在去年冬天由三个乡六个村的小型初级社合并转成高级社的。
    从夏收分配和目前的生产情况看，这个社办的还算不坏。在今年雨多、活紧并且有一百多个劳力外出（防汛和支援建设工地）的情况下，除虫、夏收、夏种、间苗、除草等农活，都没有耽误。根据预分方案和麦季实收的情况，90.9％的社员比去年麦季增加了收入，一般能增加25％，最高的能增加30％。一个中常劳动力差不多能分三百来斤麦子。
    虽然收成不坏，一些社员的思想却有些动荡。这个社要再向前迈进，还得解决许多重要问题。最重要的一个问题，就是全社领导人员和社员还是几股劲，几股线还没有真正拧成一根结结实实的绳子。
    并社以后，各个乡各个小社的主要干部都合到了一块儿，应该说领导力量是大大加强了。可是，实际上并没有加强多少。虽然从领导机构上看是集中了，可是干部的力量并没有集中起来。干部的思想很不一致。家在哪个乡住的干部，心眼就偏向哪个乡；原来在哪个小社的干部，就只关心哪个小社改编成的队。各队之间往往互不相信，相互扯皮。
    随着合作社的合并，党的基层组织形式已经有所改变，建立了统一的总支委员会。在区委指导下，选了原来的一个乡支部书记刘得祥担任总支书记。当时各乡的党员互不了解，选得不够恰当；现在，别的支委都不服气。因此，不但不尊重领导，还故意找总支书记的岔子。刘得祥在这种情况下，也很难发挥积极性。有的社干部（党员）有本位主义思想，假报了劳动工分；还有个别党员在守场的时候偷了麦子。总支对于这些严重问题都没有处理。
    并社以后，乡也合并了。三个乡的十三个乡干部集中了起来。可是，他们也没有起应有的作用。乡干部把自己应担负的许多工作（交公粮，优待军属等），都推给农业社干部去做。乡干部曾经闲得没有事干，社干部却忙得不可开交。
    农业生产合作社管理委员会的领导力量比较强；但是因为包办的事情太多太杂，本身工作也没有做好。许多社干部把大部分精力消耗在庞杂的行政事务工作中了。整天不是这个乡的人找就是那个队的人找；一忽儿解决纠纷，一忽儿解决生活困难问题。十一个干部只应付这些事就应付不过来；生产上和社员思想上的许多问题，都不能及时解决。社干部的思想也不一致。管理委员会虽然包括各村的社员选出的委员，但是，原来基础较好的松林店乡的委员较多，能力也较强，在领导上占优势。这些干部对别的乡村的工作和干部或多或少有些偏见；对各乡各村的干部团结得较差，指责和批评较多。他们对工作基础较差的房树乡，具体帮助很不够，光说房树乡这也“落后”那也“不好”。因此，在干部之间已引起了一些对抗情绪。管理委员会处理什么问题，决定什么事情，意见很难一致；就是决定了，也不能很好地执行。如今春管理委员会号召除虫，有的队很快执行了，有的队迟迟不动。有些老社员反映：“大社这么多干部，反不如小社领导的好了。今年比去年松多了，有的社员几天不上地里干活，也没人管。”
    现在，社干部为了克服本位主义的毛病，把各个管理委员原来领导的队互换了一下。这样做，并没有从思想上解决问题，实际上并不能避免本位主义；反而对工作更不利了。这样一调换，使干部对情况不熟悉了；有些社干部虽然到了队里，但是因为对情况生疏，工作却深入不下去。
    队本位、乡本位思想，不仅在干部之间存在，在社员之间也很普遍。各队的社员都只说自己的队好，光想找别队的缺点，互相间的学习和帮助很差。有利的事情抢着自己队里做，没利的事情总想往外推。今年小麦没有受损失的乡（高地多），许多人在埋怨背了别乡的亏。他们没有看到低洼地区改稻田后多收了粮食也要统一分配，也没有看到无论哪块地生产出来的麦子，实际上都包含着全体社员的劳动和全社的生产资金。这些思想，显然妨碍着合作社的巩固和发展。但是，当地的一些干部对这个问题却没有予以应有的注意。
    各村各队的历史情况和工作基础不同，干部的能力和经验不同，社员的阶级成分和思想觉悟水平不同，因此，队与队、组与组之间的生产情况也有很大差别。如十五队和十六队的土地、劳力都差不多，但禾苗生长情况却差得很远。
    第十六队雇农占多数，是很好的一个队。前几天，有些队的社员看到一部分地涝了，小麦受了点损失，情绪就消沉了。第十六队里许多社员的情绪却一直很好。这个队在劳动管理方面也有比较好的办法。他们根据队里农活的具体情况，适当调整了不合理的劳动报酬标准。他们经过认真的研究，把定高了的分数减下来，把定得低了的提高。全队从管委会承包的工分总数没有变，在队里分配得却比较合理了。这样做，队里的社员很满意，觉得无论做什么活都不吃亏，叫干什么就干什么。队里规定有严格的制度：每天记工，一天也不许积压。他们对于土地和农活情况掌握得也比较好，全队土地分远、中、近三类，在每类土地中，又按组数和作物种植情况划分成差不多大的许多地块，每块地都标明亩数、种什么，编号插上木牌。队长和组长掌握着详细的登记表；几个组长和队长一碰头，很快就可以把农活安排好，一下子就可以安排好几天的活。因此，这个队开会又少又短，生产搞的又快又好。如果认真研究和总结一下这个队的经验，把它推广到全社各队，会起多么大的作用啊！可是，当地许多干部只看到这个队开会少，这个队也不愿多参加社里的会，便说这个队“缺乏政治”。
    有的生产队的工作比较好，有的生产队的工作比较差，这并不是什么奇怪的事。如果社干部团结得好，各队之间能相互学习，取长补短，任何一个队的好经验都可以变成全社的财富。只是因为全社干部还缺少集体主义精神，各队不但不互相学习，反而互相排斥，局部的小利益把眼睛遮蔽住了，就看不见全社的巨大的利益了。
