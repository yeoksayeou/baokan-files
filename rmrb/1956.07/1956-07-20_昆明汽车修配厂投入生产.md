Xinhua News Agency News: The Kunming Automobile Repair Factory, the largest automobile repair factory in Yunnan Province, which has been rebuilt, went into production on July 17th.

If this factory implements a three-shift work system, it can overhaul more than 2,000 vehicles per year. Now, operating on a one-shift work system, it can already undertake 80% of the major repairs for state-owned vehicles in Yunnan Province. This will gradually alleviate the current congestion in Yunnan's vehicle repair situation, and it will also improve the quality of repairs and the utilization rate of old vehicles, in order to adapt to the busy transportation tasks on the Yunnan plateau.

This factory was successfully rebuilt from an existing small automobile repair factory. The newly built factory buildings are located on the shores of Kunming Lake, with a factory area twice as large as the old factory. The new factory building is equipped with various lathes purchased from Hungary and from Tianjin, Shanghai and other domestic locations, which has made up for the deficiencies in the incomplete processes of the old factory. The heavy manual transport labor in the general assembly workshop will soon be replaced by electric traveling cranes transported from Beijing. (Attached picture)

    昆明汽车修配厂投入生产
    据新华社讯　经过改建的云南省最大的汽车修配厂——地方国营昆明汽车修配厂，七月十七日投入生产。
    这个工厂若实行三班工作制，每年可以大修理汽车两千辆以上；现在实行一班工作制，已经能担负起目前云南省80％的国营汽车的大修理工作，这将逐步改变云南目前修车拥挤的现象，并且可使修车质量和旧车利用率提高，以适应云南高原上繁忙的运输任务。
    这个厂是利用一个旧有的小型汽车修配厂改建成功的。新建的厂房座落在昆明湖边，厂房面积比旧厂房大一倍。新厂房里安装有从匈牙利和国内天津、上海等地买来的各种车床，旧厂工序不齐的缺陷得到了弥补。总装配车间里繁重的人工运输劳动，也即将由北京运来的电动行车所代替。（附图片）
