Following the Mass Line
—An Interview with Shang Jinxiu, Director of Wuhan Yuhua Cotton Mill—
　　Our Reporter Cao Baoming (Continued from yesterday)

    Learning from Advanced Experience

    "Another issue we paid attention to during the organization of the production upsurge was the serious learning and promotion of advanced experiences. The Municipal Party Committee called on all factories in the city to catch up with the national advanced production levels. We considered: to catch up with the advanced, we must first understand the advanced and learn from the advanced. The masses have high enthusiasm, and the cadres have great energy, but to realize the plan, we still need a material foundation—that is, advanced science and technology.

      "Our Chief Engineer Ye has always paid attention to learning from advanced experience and has also paid attention to studying the advanced experiences published in newspapers and periodicals. However, our past work had shortcomings: a few people learned, but most people didn't; we paid attention to learning from other places but not from other cotton mills in our city; after sending people to study outside and return, we would listen to his report once and ask him to make a plan for promotion, but then rarely asked about it. When he encountered difficulties below, he lacked specific support and assistance, so the promotion was very poor.

      "This time, the Party Committee conducted a lot of ideological education among all employees, especially among technicians. I mainly focused on ‘organization’ and ‘support.’ Once I found advanced experience somewhere, I would organize relevant personnel to learn it. After they returned from learning, I would specifically support their experiments and promotions in terms of labor allocation and material supply. In March, we heard from the Wuhan No. 1 State-owned Cotton Mill at the Municipal Textile Management Bureau that the small bottom of the modified carding machine had stabilized the quality of cotton yarn. The next day, we sent six technicians to learn it. After returning, we actively promoted it, and quickly improved the efficiency of the carding machine in removing impurities. Later, Deputy Chief Engineer Shen led five technicians to stay in this factory for two days to specifically learn their experience in cleanliness work. After returning and promoting it, the number of broken ends was reduced by 13%. At that time, Secretary Zhang of the Provincial Party Committee came to our factory. We reported this situation to him. He praised it very much and said that it was the right thing to do. We have also recently established a regular exchange of technical data with cotton mills in Beijing, Qingdao, Tianjin, Zhengzhou, and other places, which makes it easier to understand and learn from the advanced.

     Carefully Summarizing and Promoting

      "Another important content of learning from the advanced is to require technicians at all levels to go deep into reality and specifically and carefully summarize the advanced operating experience of workers. We also summarized the experience of our factory's workers in the past, but many of them did not consult with the masses and simply wrote a few points, and even the advanced producers themselves did not know if these were the characteristics. This time, we emphasized to the technicians that they must not only be able to talk about it theoretically, but also go deep into reality and study together with the masses. Technician Jiang Meisheng of the reeling workshop found that Yuan Yugui had completed all her plans very well, so he went to carefully observe her operating characteristics, then talked to her about her experience, and then observed and studied. After the initial summary, he also gathered the workers in the group to discuss and further inspire Yuan Yugui to clarify what her strengths and weaknesses were in her operation. Yuan Yugui's operating characteristics were fast knotting (high output), small knots (good quality), and short waste silk (saving), but her action of taking the bobbin down was not as fast as Wei Chunmei. It took her 18 minutes to take down 80 spindles, while Wei Chunmei only needed 10 minutes. The workshop also organized Yuan Yugui to learn Wei Chunmei's action to make this experience more perfect.

    "Also, in the past, our promotion of advanced experience was just that the technicians talked about it at the meeting, and the advanced producers performed it. It was not very in-depth, and the workers were bored with it. The place where we originally gave reports was at Station No. 4, and the workers made up a jingle: 'Station No. 4, rehashing old news, blink of an eye, all is lost.' This satirized that our promotion of advanced experience was just talking about big principles, and also satirized that our promotion of advanced experience was quick to start and quick to fail. This time, we emphasized that the people who promote advanced experience must be able to speak and do. When the reeling workshop promoted Yuan Yugui's operating experience, they first taught the foremen and deputy foremen to truly become the leaders in promoting this advanced experience. The workshops also created many in-depth promotion methods, such as using the ten-minute meeting time after work to conduct observation and learning, organizing workers who learned well to teach and learn with workers who learned poorly, and the foreman of each shift understanding the learning progress of the workers in the shift on the same day to help overcome difficulties in a timely manner, and so on. When promoting certain major operating experiences, the advanced producers themselves were also extracted to specifically serve as technical instructors for a short period of time. In this way, we summarized and promoted 47 advanced experiences of our factory's workers, of which 19 were relatively important experiences incorporated into the technical regulations, which had a great effect on improving production. Yuan Yugui's experience increased the shift output of each worker by 5 to 15 catties, up to more than 20 catties, overcoming the phenomenon of backlog of semi-finished products in the reeling workshop.

      Caring for the Livelihood of Employees

    "We also have an experience in organizing production upsurges, that is, we must care for the livelihood of employees. In February, the front spinning workshop promoted the needle-copying method and found that worker Lu Dengxiang was unwilling to learn and was very depressed. The workshop's labor union chairman and deputy foreman went to understand the situation in depth and found that he had borrowed more than 50 yuan when he entertained his fellow villagers the year before; his monthly income was 54 yuan, and he also had to support a family of five. After he received his salary every month, many people asked him to repay his debts, which made him depressed. The workshop labor union specifically helped him arrange his life so that he could save 6 yuan a month to repay his debts. The labor union also convened the creditors to talk and decided that he would hand over the money to the labor union every month, and the labor union would repay it for him. In this way, the family life problem was solved, no one came to the door to collect debts, and he was at ease. He later actively learned the needle-copying method and was also elected as the labor union group leader. The front spinning workshop ranked the 49 people who were not active in learning advanced experience and found that 13 of them were because of financial difficulties and could not concentrate on production. Under the leadership of the branch, they also formed a visiting group to go deep into the workers' families to help solve specific difficulties.

    "In terms of caring for the livelihood of employees, our administration mainly takes two measures: one is regular summary, inspection, and arrangement. Our factory director's office meeting has one meeting every month that is specifically for discussing the livelihood and welfare work of employees. The deputy factory director in charge of life reports, and finally unifies the arrangements. During the Spring Festival this year, we took a sum of money from the enterprise bonus to subsidize employees with multiple children and those with financial difficulties, so that everyone could have a good Spring Festival. A total of 268 people were subsidized, spending more than 3,000 yuan. Recently, the administration has also advanced funds to buy more than 140 mosquito nets for single employees who do not have nets. Because each net costs 8 yuan, some workers have financial difficulties and cannot afford so much money at one time. Now we advance the funds to buy them first, and then deduct them in four installments, 2 yuan each time, which is easier to afford.

      Going to the Workers' Dormitories

    "Another way to care for the livelihood of employees is for leaders to go deep into the employees' dormitories to specifically understand and solve problems. At the beginning of this year, when it snowed heavily, I went to inspect the collective dormitories with the deputy factory director and the head of the public utilities section and found that the stairs were very slippery and easy to fall. We asked the cleaners to sweep away the snow on the corridors and put straw mats on the stairs, and the problem was solved immediately. A few days ago, we went to inspect the dormitories again and found that there were too many clothes drying in the room and the air was not circulating. The main reason was that no one took care of the clothes drying outside, and everyone was afraid of losing them, so they were all drying them indoors. More than 1,000 people live in the collective dormitory. We decided to transfer two elderly women to take care of them, so that the employees could wash their clothes and dry them outside without losing them. Everyone was very satisfied with this practice. This time, we also found that female workers were wearing wooden slippers in the collective dormitory, disturbing other people's sleep and affecting the unity of the two shifts of workers. They wore wooden slippers to go to the bathhouse to take a bath. We decided that the administration would buy some wooden slippers and place them in front of the bathhouse door, so that people who take a bath could change their shoes there and were not allowed to wear wooden slippers in the collective dormitory. Those who had already bought wooden shoes could put them away and not wear them, or the administration would pay to buy them. If they didn't want to sell them, they could take them home, and it was not forced. Recently, I heard that there are still a few people who do not understand, and we are working with the labor union to persuade them. Don't look down on this small matter, if it is not resolved in time, these young girls will first make trouble in the dormitory, and slowly they will argue about shifts, affecting production.

      "We have also done some work in medical and health, food, wages, production bonuses, etc., and there are summaries every month, so I won't say more.

      The Ears and Eyes are Sharp Now

      "Recently, everyone has reflected that there are too few recreational and sports activities. I also asked the club committee members the reason. He said that there was no money, no time, and the leaders did not support it. In fact, there is only one reason—the leaders do not support it. I specifically studied with him. He said: 'The play has been rehearsed, but there are sixteen wooden frames missing for the scenery.' I immediately agreed to have the administration make them, but after the frames are made, the club must perform the play. He also said that the employees' spare time was filled with other activities. I asked the Party Committee for instructions and decided that the spare time on Saturday afternoon would be free activity time for employees to rehearse plays, practice singing, and practice ball. No work would take up this time. I also told him: 'In the future, when you have meetings to study work, notify me, and I will take time to participate.'

      "Why do we do this? There are many young workers in our factory, and if recreational and sports activities are not done well, it will affect everyone's mood. Many of the people who participate in these activities are activists in production. If you contact them once or twice, they will become familiar with you, and when they meet you, they will chat with you and tell you many important situations, even though they don't want to report anything to you.

      "As a factory director, I don't have much time to contact the masses directly. When we go to the workshops, the workers are in production, and we can't talk about other issues besides work. When the workers get off work, we are still in the office. If there is nothing important, they will not come to us. After implementing some of the above practices, we can unite a group of technicians and old workers in technology, unite a group of advanced producers in production, and unite a group of young activists in recreational activities. With a wider range of contact with the masses, our ears and eyes will be much sharper, we can understand the situation more, and we can consider problems more comprehensively and practically."

    走群众路线
    ——访武汉裕华纱厂厂长尚金修——
　　本报记者　曹葆铭（续昨）
    学习先进经验
    “我们在组织生产高潮中注意的另一个问题，是认真学习和推广先进经验。市委号召全市工厂赶上全国先进生产水平。我们考虑：要赶上先进，就必须首先了解先进，学习先进。群众热情高，干部劲头大，但是要实现规划，还得有物质基础——这就是先进的科学技术。
      “我们的叶总工程师一贯就比较注意学习先进经验，对报刊上登的先进经验也注意研究。但是，我们过去的工作有缺点：少数人学，多数人没学；注意学外地的，不注意学本市各纱厂的；派人到外面学习回来后，我们听他汇报一次，叫他订个推广的计划后，便很少过问，他在下面遇到困难，又缺少具体支持和帮助，所以推广得很差。
      “这次，党委在全体职工中，特别是在技术人员中，进行了许多思想教育工作。我主要抓‘组织’和‘支持’这两件事。一发现哪里有先进经验，便组织有关人员去学，学习回来后，又在劳动调配上、材料供应上具体支持他们试验和推广。三月里，我们在市纺管局听到武汉国棉一厂改装梳棉机小漏底，稳定了棉纱质量，第二天便派了六名技术人员去学，回来后积极推广，很快就提高了梳棉机清除杂质的效能。后来，沈副总工程师又领着五名技术人员去这个工厂住了两天，专门学习他们的整洁工作的经验，回来推广后，便降低了断头13％。当时，省委张书记来我们工厂，我们向他汇报了这个情况，他很赞扬，说这样做对头。我们最近还同北京、青岛、天津、郑州等地的纱厂建立了定期交换技术资料的关系，这样更便于了解先进，学习先进。
     细致地总结和推广
      “学习先进的另一个重要内容，是要各级技术人员深入实际，具体细致地总结工人的先进操作经验。我们过去也总结过本厂工人的经验，但是很多都不同群众商量，便简单写上几条，连先进生产者本人也不知道是不是这几个特点。这次，我们就在技术人员中强调不光要会从理论上讲，还必须深入实际，和群众共同研究。摇纱车间技术员江美盛发现袁玉桂各项计划都完成得很好，便去仔细观察她的操作特点，然后找本人谈体会，再观察研究。初步总结出来以后，还召集本组工人讨论，进一步启发袁玉桂明确自己的操作有哪些长处、哪些缺点。袁玉桂的操作特点是接头快（产量高）、结头小（质量好）、回丝短（节约），但她下筒生头的动作不如魏春梅快，她下八十个锭子需十八分钟，而魏春梅只需十分钟。车间又组织袁玉桂学习魏春梅这个动作，使这项经验更加完善。
    “还有，我们过去推广先进经验，只是技术员在大会上讲讲，先进生产者表演表演，很不深入，工人们都厌烦了。我们原来作报告的地方在四号站，工人便编了个顺口溜：‘四号站，炒现饭，眼睛一眨，完了蛋。’讽刺我们推广先进经验是光讲大道理，也讽刺我们推广先进经验是起得快，垮得快。我们这次强调推广先进经验的人必须会说、会作。摇纱车间在推广袁玉桂的操作经验时，是先教会工长、副工长，使她们真正成为推广这个先进经验的领导。各车间还创造出许多深入推广的办法，如利用下班后的十分钟碰头时间进行观摩学习，组织学习好的工人同学习差的工人包教包学，每班工长了解本班工人当天学习进度情况及时帮助克服困难，等等。在推广某些重大的操作经验的时候，还将先进生产者本人抽出来，专门作一个短时期的技术指导工作。我们就这样总结和推广了本厂工人的先进经验四十七项，其中有十九项是纳入了技术规程的比较重大的经验，对改进生产的作用很大。袁玉桂的经验使每个工人的班产量提高了五斤至十五斤，最高二十多斤，克服了在摇纱车间积压半成品的现象。
      关心职工生活
    “我们在组织生产高潮中还有一个体会，就是必须关心职工生活。二月里，前纺车间推广抄针工作法，发现工人路登香不愿学，很沉闷。车间工会主席和副工长去深入了解情况，发现他在前年招待乡亲时借了五十多元的债；他每月收入五十四元，还要养活五口人，每月发工资后，很多人找他还债，弄得他情绪低落。车间工会便具体帮助他安排生活，每月可以节余六元还债。工会又召集债主谈话，决定他每月将钱交给工会，工会替他还。这样，家庭生活问题解决了，没有人上门讨债，他也就安心了。他后来积极学会了抄针工作法，还当选为工会小组长。前纺车间将学习先进经验不积极的四十九个人排了排队，查出有十三人是因为生活困难，生产安不下心。他们又在支部领导下成立了访问小组，深入工人家庭帮助解决具体困难。
    “在关心职工生活方面，我们行政上主要采取两个办法：一个是定期总结、检查和安排。我们厂长办公会议每月有一次是专门讨论职工生活福利工作的，由管理生活的副厂长汇报，最后统一安排。今年春节，我们从企业奖金中抽出一笔钱来补助多子女和生活困难的职工，让大家过好春节，一共补助了268人，花了三千多元。最近，行政上又垫款买了一百四十多床蚊帐给没有帐子的单身职工。因为每床帐子值八元钱，有的工人生活困难，一次拿不出这多钱，现在由我们垫款先买来，以后分四次扣还，每次两元，就比较容易出了。
      到工人宿舍去
    “关心职工生活的另一个办法，是领导人深入职工宿舍，具体了解和解决问题。今年年初下大雪，我同副厂长、公共事业科长到集体宿舍检查，发现楼梯很滑，容易滑倒人。我们便叫清洁工将走廊上的积雪扫掉，在楼梯上铺上草垫子，马上就把问题解决了。前几天，我们又到宿舍检查，发现室内晾的衣服太多，空气不流通。主要原因是衣服晒在外面没人照管，大家怕丢失了，所以都晾在室内。集体宿舍住有一千多人，我们决定调两个老年妇女去照管，职工洗好衣服晒在外面，便不致丢失。这个做法大家很满意。我们这次还查出女工们在集体宿舍穿木板拖鞋，搅扰别人睡眠，以致影响两班工人不团结。她们穿木板拖鞋，是为了到澡堂洗澡。我们便决定由行政上买些木板拖鞋摆在澡堂门前，洗澡的人就在那里换鞋子，不准在集体宿舍穿木板拖鞋。已经买了木板鞋的，收起来不穿也可惜，便由行政上出钱收买。如不愿卖，也可以拿回家去，不勉强。最近听说还有少数人思想不通，我们又协同工会进行说服工作。别看这是件小事，如果不及时解决，这些年轻女孩子先在宿舍里闹不团结，慢慢地就会在交接班上扯皮，影响生产。
      “我们还在医疗卫生、伙食、工资、生产奖励等方面作了些工作，每月都有总结，就不多说了。
      耳目灵敏了
      “最近，大家反映文娱体育活动太少。我又找俱乐部委员来问原因，他说是没有钱，没有时间，领导不支持。实际上就是一个原因——领导不支持。我便同他具体研究。他讲：‘戏都排好了，就是缺十六个布景的木框子。’我马上答应由行政制作，但框子作好后，俱乐部就得演出戏来。他又说职工业余时间都被别的活动排满了，我便请示党委决定星期六下午的业余时间为职工排戏、练歌、练球的自由活动时间，任何工作都不占用。我还告诉他：‘你们以后开会研究工作，通知我，我抽空去参加。’
      “为什么要这样作呢？我们工厂的青年工人很多，文娱体育活动搞不好，影响大家情绪。参加这些活动的，有很多是生产上的积极分子。你跟他们接触一两次，他们就跟你熟了，见了面就跟你扯谈，谈许多重要情况给你听，虽然他并不想向你汇报什么东西。
      “作为一个厂长，跟群众直接联系的时间并不多。我们下车间去，工人正在生产，除了工作外，不能谈别的问题。工人下班的时候，我们还在办公，如果没有重要事情，他们也不来找我们。实行了上面所说的一些做法以后，我们就能在技术上团结一批技术人员和老工人，在生产中团结一批先进生产者，在文娱活动中团结一批青年活动分子。同群众联系的面宽了，我们的耳目就会灵敏的多，能更多地了解情况，考虑问题也能较比全面，较比切合实际。”　　（完）
