Xinhua News Agency, Zhenyuan, July 24th: At the first session of the first People's Congress of the Qian Dongnan Miao and Dong Autonomous Prefecture, nineteen representatives from the Lu Mountain Miao Autonomous County were entrusted to bring three precious gifts to the congress: a pair of black velvet cloth shoes, a pair of fish-scale-shaped cloth sock bottoms, and a pair of embroidered cloth insoles.

These three gifts were presented to the congress by Grandma Jiang Chongma, a 114-year-old woman from Qingping Town, Lu Mountain Miao Autonomous County. She specifically instructed the People's Representatives who brought the gifts to say: "These are for the Governor, and I hope he will wear the gifts I send, go to the countryside more, travel more, and do more good things for the Miao people."

This elderly but still healthy Grandma Jiang was very excited when she heard the news about the establishment of the Qian Dongnan Miao and Dong Autonomous Prefecture a month ago. She and her daughter-in-law made these three gifts.

In her more than a hundred years, Grandma Jiang experienced the cruel ethnic oppression of the Qing Dynasty and the Kuomintang reactionaries. Her uncle and brother, along with five others, were successively brutally murdered by the reactionary rulers. She herself suffered the torment of a bitter life. In the six years since liberation, she has personally experienced the happy life of the Miao people after they stood up.

    114岁苗族老人的礼物
    据新华社镇远24日电　黔东南苗族侗族自治州第一届人民代表大会第一次会议上，炉山苗族自治县的十九位人民代表，受托带给大会三件珍贵的礼物——一双黑色绒面布鞋；一双鱼鳞形布袜底和一双绣花布鞋垫。
    这三件礼物是炉山苗族自治县清平镇114岁的姜重麻老太太给大会的献礼。她曾特别嘱咐给她带礼物的人民代表说：“这是献给州长的，希望他穿上我送的礼物，多下乡，多跑路，多为苗家办好事。”
    这位年迈而仍健康的姜老太太，在一个月前听到黔东南苗族侗族自治州将要成立的消息以后，非常兴奋。她和自己的儿媳做出了这三件礼物。
    姜老太太在一百多年的岁月里，经受过清朝和国民党反动派的残酷的民族压迫。她的叔叔和哥哥等七人先后惨遭反动统治者杀害。自己曾受尽了苦难生活的煎熬。解放后六年来，她亲身体会到苗族人民翻身后的幸福生活。
