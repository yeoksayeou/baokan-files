Why Disrupt the Production and Sales Relationship of Qichun Camphor?

Camphor is an important sideline product for farmers in Qichun County, Hubei Province. Due to the increasing need for camphor in chemical, pharmaceutical, and other industries, the production of camphor in Qichun County has greatly developed in recent years. In 1951, the county produced approximately 80,000 jin of camphor, and by 1955, the county's production had increased to 800,000 jin. Every year, people from Shanghai and Hunan come to Qichun to purchase camphor.

However, at the beginning of this year, the Native Produce and Subsidiary Food Management Office of the Hubei Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative (hereinafter referred to as the Provincial Management Office) issued a notice to the Qichun County Supply and Marketing Cooperative, stating that camphor is an industrial oil and cannot be sold outside the province. The notice instructed the Qichun County Supply and Marketing Cooperative to cancel the contracts signed with Shanghai and other places and to have the Provincial Management Office purchase the camphor. However, the seller was required to transport the camphor to Hankou, and the price was even lower than what Shanghai offered when picking up the goods in Qichun. Qichun County disagreed with this practice of the Provincial Management Office, so the Provincial Management Office directly sent people to Shanghai and Hunan to prevent buyers from picking up and transporting camphor in Qichun. In this way, the channel for Qichun camphor to be sold outside the province was blocked.

What happened afterwards? 70,000 jin of camphor were purchased by the Provincial Management Office according to the prescribed price and method, and then transported to Hunan for high-price sales. Currently, the Qichun County Supply and Marketing Cooperative has more than 200,000 jin of camphor in stock that have not been sold. It is understood that farmers also have more than 200,000 jin in stock. Many farmers who manufacture camphor have been forced to stop production, while some units in other places that need camphor cannot buy it.

Is the practice of the Native Produce and Subsidiary Food Management Office of the Hubei Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative aimed at supporting farmers' sideline production, or is it for its own profit?

    为什么打乱蕲春樟脑的产销关系
    樟脑是湖北省蕲春县农民重要的副业产品。由于化工、医药等生产对樟脑的需要日益增多，蕲春县樟脑生产几年来有了很大的发展。1951年全县生产樟脑约八万斤，到1955年全县就增产到八十万斤。每年，上海、湖南都有人到蕲春来采购樟脑。
    但是，今年年初，湖北省供销合作社土产副食品管理处（以下简称省管理处）给蕲春县供销合作社发来一个通知，说樟脑是工业用油，不能外销，要蕲春县供销合作社撤销和上海等地订立的合同，由省管理处收购，但是要卖方把樟脑送到汉口，而价格却比上海到蕲春提货的还低。蕲春县不同意省管理处这种做法，于是省管理处就直接派人到上海、湖南制止买方到蕲春提运樟脑。就这样，蕲春樟脑外销的路被卡住了。
    以后的情况怎样呢？有七万斤樟脑由省管理处按规定的价格和办法收购后，竟被运往湖南高价销售了。现在蕲春县供销社还积压着二十多万斤樟脑没有卖出去，据了解在农民手里也积压着二十多万斤。有很多制造樟脑的农民已经被迫停止了生产，而外地有些需要樟脑的单位却买不到货。
    湖北省供销合作社土产副食品管理处这种作法，到底是为了扶持农民的副业生产呢？还是为了自己赢利呢？
