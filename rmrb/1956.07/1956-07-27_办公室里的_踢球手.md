    The "Kicker" in the Office

    Quite a few cadres in offices are "kicking the ball." They kick official documents, letters, and such back and forth endlessly.

    A says, this matter should be handled by B. B says, this matter should be handled by A. Sometimes C and D, and even more people, are kicking it back and forth, with no one willing to concede.

    Does this kind of kicking delay work? It seems they haven't considered this question.

    办公室里的“踢球手”
    不少干部在办公室里“踢球”。把公文、信件等类踢来踢去，踢个不休。
    甲说，这件事该乙办。乙说，这件事该甲办。有时丙和丁以至更多的人都在里面互相踢，谁也不肯服输。
    这样踢法是否贻误工作呢？好像他们没有考虑这个问题。
