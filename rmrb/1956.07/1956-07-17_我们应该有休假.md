    We Should Have Vacations
    We are all township cadres who have participated in the revolution for six or seven years. Because the leadership has not stipulated a vacation system for us, we have not had any holidays in the past six or seven years. We get up at six o'clock every morning and can't rest until around twelve o'clock at night. Over time, this inevitably affects our health.
    Our work is to deal with the peasant masses, and most of our work is concentrated in the evenings, with very little to do during the day. Except for the summer harvest, autumn harvest, and rush planting seasons, we are fully able to rest. Therefore, we suggest that the leadership quickly establish a vacation system for our township cadres.

    我们应该有休假
    我们都是参加革命六、七年的乡干部，因为领导上没有给我们规定休假制度，所以，六、七年来一直没有度过什么假日。我们每天早上六点起床，直到夜里十二点左右才能休息。天长日久，就不能不影响到我们的健康。
    我们的工作是同农民群众打交道，工作大半集中在晚上，白天事很少。除去夏收、秋收、抢种等季节，我们完全是有条件休息的。因此，我们建议领导上赶快给我们乡干部规定休假制度。
