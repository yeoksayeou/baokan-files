    Guangxi Animal Liquor is Selling Well in Southeast Asia

    (Our Dispatch) Various animal medicinal liquors manufactured by the jointly state-private Guangxi Wuzhou Longshan Distillery are selling well in Singapore, Malaya, Borneo, Thailand, Indonesia, and other places. In May of this year, the Wuzhou branch of the China National Native Produce Export Corporation reached a deal with returning overseas Chinese merchants at the Guangzhou Materials Exchange Fair for export to Singapore. This merchant bought more than 120 cases of animal medicinal liquor in one purchase, and then negotiated a long-term contract for annual sales of 2,100 cases of animal medicinal liquor.

    Guangxi's animal medicinal liquor production was just over 120,000 jin last year, with only four varieties: gecko wine, hairy chicken wine, and Gouania leptostachya wine. This year, the plan is to produce 250,000 jin, and three more types of wine will be gradually added: tiger bone and papaya wine, horse mane snake wine, and black gibbon wine. The export volume is also increasing accordingly. Only more than 30,000 bottles were exported throughout last year, while the export volume in the first half of this year has reached more than 30,000 bottles.

    The manufacturing of animal medicinal liquor has a history of several decades in Wuzhou. These liquors are not only fragrant and mellow in quality, but some can also nourish, and some can treat diseases such as dispelling wind, removing dampness, and promoting blood circulation. They are extremely popular among consumers at home and abroad.

    广西动物药酒畅销南洋
    本报讯　公私合营广西梧州龙山酒厂制造的各种动物药酒，远销新加坡、马来亚、婆罗洲、泰国、印度尼西亚等地。今年五月间，中国土产出口公司梧州支公司在广州物资交流会上和归国华侨达成远销新加坡的交易，这个侨商一次就买了120余箱动物药酒，接着商洽成年销2，100箱动物药酒的长期合同。
    广西的动物药酒去年才生产了12万余市斤，品种仅蛤蚧酒、毛鸡酒、抓鸡虎酒等四种，今年计划生产了25万市斤，并陆续增加虎骨木瓜、马鬃蛇、乌猿等三种酒。出口数量也随着增加，去年全年才出口三万余瓶，今年上半年出口量就达三万余瓶。
    制造动物药酒在梧州已有几十年的历史，这些酒不但品质香醇，而且有的还能滋补，有的还能治如祛风、去湿、活血等病症，极受国内外消费者的欢迎。
