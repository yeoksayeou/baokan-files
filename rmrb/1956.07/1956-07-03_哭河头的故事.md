The year we began to harness the Huai River, I took a trip to Lingbi and Sixian counties in the middle reaches of the Huai River and visited historical sites such as Overlord City, Yu Ji's Tomb, and Cry River Head. Due to the passage of time, they no longer have any distinctive features, but many legends circulate in this area. Cry River Head is one of them.

It is said that when Xiang Yu, the Overlord of Chu, was trapped in Gaixia by Liu Bang, his beloved concubine Yu Ji committed suicide. The Overlord of Chu hid her head in his arms, fighting and retreating, until he reached a dry riverbank. Seeing that the pursuing soldiers had slowed down a bit, he took out the beauty's head and mourned her. As he looked at it, he couldn't help but shed a few tears and finally burst into tears. This river, due to its perennial dryness, was once called Dry River Head, but after the Overlord of Chu cried here, people have since called it Cry River Head.

Cry River Head is a tributary of the Sui River. When the Sui River was dredged in 1951, the laborers dug up layers of grain from the riverbed. These grains also have a sad story.

According to legend, when Emperor Yang of Sui, Yang Guang, traveled to Yangzhou in a dragon boat, he passed through Cry River Head, but there was no water, and the dragon boat couldn't pass. Yang Guang was very anxious. To dig out water would require digging for at least ten miles, and it was unknown how long it would take to complete, which would delay his enjoyment of the Qionghua flowers. Someone came up with an idea for him: if the grain was stir-fried with oil until it was slippery and then spread on the riverbed, the dragon boat could be pushed over it. Yang Guang immediately ordered the search for all the grain from the people, fried it with sesame oil, spread it on the riverbed, and had tens of thousands of laborers push the dragon boat across the ten-mile stretch of dry river.

Thus, in Cry River Head, there fell once again the tears of the people on both sides of the river under tyrannical rule.

    哭河头的故事
    维进
    开始治理淮河那年，我在淮河中游的灵璧、泗县一带走了一趟，访问了霸王城、虞姬墓、哭河头等古迹。由于年代久远，它们已经没有什么特色，但是在这一带，却流传着许多传说。哭河头就是其中之一。
    据说楚霸王项羽被刘邦困在垓下的时候，他的爱妾虞姬自刎了。楚霸王把她的头颅藏在怀里，且战且退，到了一条干枯的河畔，看见追兵稍缓，便取出美人的头颅凭吊，看呀看的，不由得落下了几滴泪，终于大哭起来。这条河由于长年干枯，曾经叫枯河头，后来楚霸王在这里哭了一场，人们从此都叫它哭河头了。
    哭河头是濉河的支流。1951年濉河疏浚的时候，民工在河床里，挖出了一层层的谷子。这些谷子却又有一段伤心的故事。
    据传说，当年隋炀帝杨广坐龙船到扬州去的时候，路经哭河头，没有水，龙船过不去。杨广很焦急。挖出水来吧，至少要挖十来里地，不知要多少时间才能竣工，看琼花就耽误了。不知是谁给他想了一个办法：如果将谷子用油炒得滑溜溜的，铺在河床里把龙船从这上面推过去。杨广就立刻下令搜索民间所有的谷子，用香油炒好，铺在河床里，由成千上万的民工把龙船推过这十多里地的干河。
    于是，哭河头里，又落过两岸人民在暴政下的无告的眼泪。
