Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 1st. Recently, the Liaoning Provincial Aquatic Products Department and aquatic product research institutes caught thirteen rare freshwater fish species – mirror carp – in a reservoir in Jin County. Each weighed three to four *jin*. They have been released into a specially established temporary breeding farm.

This type of fish originated in Europe. Currently, in our country, only a small amount is produced in the southwest region. Compared with common carp, this fish has large and sparse scales, a golden-red to yellow body color, and some are blue-gray. It is lively and agile when swimming in the water.

According to relevant department identification, in addition to the advantages of rapid growth and early maturity, this fish also has high nutritional value. It contains more than 4% more protein, 2.74% more fat, and 27.36% more minerals and solids than ordinary carp.

The discovery of this fish has aroused widespread interest in domestic aquatic product production and experimental research departments. At present, the Liaoning Provincial Aquatic Products Bureau is working with staff from aquatic product experimental farms in Shandong Province, Harbin City, and other places to continue fishing. It is preparing to distribute the caught mirror carp in a planned way to experimental research institutions and breeding farms inside and outside the province for release and breeding.

    镜鲤——辽宁新发现的珍贵淡水鱼种
    新华社沈阳1日电　辽宁省水产部门和水产试验研究机关，最近在金县一座水库中捕捞出十三尾稀有的淡水鱼种——镜鲤。每尾都有三、四斤重。已被放养在临时专设的养殖场中。
    这种鱼原产于欧洲。在我国目前只有西南地区有少量出产。比起普通鲤鱼，这种鱼的鳞片大而稀少，体色金红带黄，还有青灰色的，在水中游泳时活泼矫健。
    根据有关部门鉴定，这种鱼除具有成长迅速和早熟的优点外，还具有较高的营养价值，它比普通鲤鱼所含的蛋白质多4％以上，脂肪多2.74％，矿物质和固形物多27.36％。
    这种鱼的发现，引起国内水产生产和试验研究部门的广泛兴趣。目前辽宁省水产局正在协同从山东省、哈尔滨市等水产试验场来的工作人员，继续进行捕捞。准备将捕捞上来的镜鲤，有计划地分配给省内外各地试验研究机关和养殖场进行放养繁殖。
