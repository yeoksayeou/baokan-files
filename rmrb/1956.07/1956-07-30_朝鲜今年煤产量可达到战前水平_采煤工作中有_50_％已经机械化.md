    Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 29th: North Korea's coal industry, severely damaged during the war, has increased its production capacity four and a half times in the three years since the war. It is estimated that this year's output will reach the level of 1949 before the war. At present, North Korea can already be self-sufficient in coal for other industries and residential use, except for coking coal and some locomotive coal which still needs to be imported. Furthermore, it has already begun to export some anthracite this year.

    During the war, most of North Korea's coal mines were flooded, tunnels collapsed, and more than 90% of the above-ground equipment was destroyed. Now, the length of newly excavated and restored tunnels has reached the pre-war length. At the same time, coal mines have gradually begun to use new machinery such as combined coal mining machines and belt conveyors for coal mining, and 50% of production has been mechanized. The welfare facilities for coal miners have also been restored and developed to some extent.

    朝鲜今年煤产量可达到战前水平
    采煤工作中有50％已经机械化
    据新华社平壤29日电　朝鲜在战争中遭到严重破坏的煤炭工业，在战后三年中生产能力增加了四倍半。预计今年的产量可达到战前1949年的水平。现在，朝鲜除炼焦用煤和部分的机车用煤还要进口外，其他工业和居民用煤已经能够自给。并且已经在今年开始出口一些无烟煤。
    在战争时期，朝鲜的煤矿大部遭到水淹，坑道塌落，井上设备也有90％以上被破坏了。现在，新挖的和恢复的坑道的长度已经达到战前的长度。同时，煤矿已经逐渐使用联合采煤机、皮带运输机等新式机械来采煤，生产中有50％已经机械化。煤矿工人的福利设施也已恢复并且有所发展。
