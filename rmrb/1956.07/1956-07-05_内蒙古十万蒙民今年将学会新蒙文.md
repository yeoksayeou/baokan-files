This Year, 100,000 Mongolian People in Inner Mongolia Will Learn the New Mongolian Script
    This year, 100,000 Mongolian people in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region will learn to use the new Mongolian script to replace the old Mongolian script that has been used for hundreds of years. Relevant departments are currently engaged in various preparatory work for the promotion of the new Mongolian script. Leagues and administrative regions have already begun training teachers for the promotion of the new Mongolian script in large numbers.
    The Inner Mongolia People's Publishing House is mass-producing books and periodicals in the new Mongolian script. This year, more than 600,000 copies of new Mongolian script literacy textbooks and new Mongolian script readers will be provided for eliminating illiteracy. More than 70,000 Mongolian first-grade children entering school this fall will no longer learn the old Mongolian script; the publishing house has prepared new Mongolian script textbooks for them.
    Because the new Mongolian script is more convenient to write, closer to the language of the masses, and better reflects modern life than the old Mongolian script, the Mongolian people of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region warmly welcome the promotion of the new Mongolian script. Many literate Mongolian farmers, herdsmen, and intellectuals in various places are actively learning the new Mongolian script.

    内蒙古十万蒙民今年将学会新蒙文
    内蒙古自治区今年将有十万蒙族人民学会用新蒙文，来代替沿用了几百年的旧蒙古文字。现在有关部门正从事各种推行新蒙文的准备工作。各盟、行政区已经开始大批训练推行新蒙文的师资。
    内蒙古人民出版社正在大量编印新蒙文书刊。今年供给扫除文盲用的新蒙文识字课本和新蒙文读本就有六十多万册。今年秋季入学的七万多名蒙族小学一年级儿童将不再学习旧蒙文，出版社已给他们准备了新蒙文课本。
    由于新蒙文比旧蒙文书写便利，更为接近群众语言和更能反映现代生活，内蒙古自治区的蒙族人民十分欢迎新蒙文的推行。各地许多识字的蒙族农、牧民和知识分子都在积极地学习新蒙文。
