    Pig Farmer Qi Fengxiang
  　Our Reporter　Lin Mo
    The Nalin Farm, a state-owned farm in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, raises over a thousand pigs. In the past, due to poor feeding and management, the grown pigs couldn't fatten up, and the sows had few piglets. When swine fever broke out, the pigs died in droves, causing the farm to suffer significant losses.
    When Qi Fengxiang, a young Mongolian man, took over as a pig farmer, the previous pig farmer, surnamed Li, stood beside the pigpen, frowned, and said to him, "You really have nothing better to do, coming to do this? Dealing with these things all day, what future is there?" But Qi Fengxiang said, "All jobs are the same, as long as you do it well, there's a future."
    "The pigs in the same pen, fed the same food, why are some fat and some thin?" Qi Fengxiang added feed to the trough, watching the pigs eat, often thinking this way. He quickly discovered that the fat pigs rushed to eat the thick feed first, while the slower ones could only eat the thin soup. From then on, he slowly tried to divide the pigs into three groups – fat, medium, and thin – and fed them in separate pens, providing different feeds according to their physique. For the thin pigs, he not only gave them better feed but also took extra care in feeding them, and they gradually fattened up.
    In the past, the farm's pig farmers would feed each adult pig two and a half catties of grain a day. They often said: If you're not willing to use the grain, you won't see fat pigs. But according to Qi Fengxiang's experience, if you don't pay attention to feeding methods, even if you lock the pigs in a granary, you still won't fatten them up. In the past, some pig farmers, to save trouble, would dump all the grain and roughage into the trough at once. The pigs would all rush to eat the good stuff first, leaving some of the roughage that they didn't like to eat. This would leave half a trough each time, wasting feed and not filling the pigs up. In order to make the pigs eat well, Qi Fengxiang practiced frequent and careful feeding. Each meal, he would give them thin feed first, then thick feed, and finally sprinkle a handful of concentrated feed. Nothing was left in the trough, and the pigs ate their fill. This way, the pigs had a strong appetite, digested well, and easily gained weight.
    Qi Fengxiang also sought ways from all sides to save grain for the country. One day, he saw a large pile of sorghum husks in the yard of the cultivation team, and he remembered that distilleries used to feed pigs with distiller's grains, and they would get very fat without feeding grain. So, he tried putting the sorghum husks in a large pot, covering them with a layer of bran, and heating the sorghum husks to ferment before feeding them to the pigs. The pigs loved to eat it. Later, he imitated the method of making distiller's grains and built a large brick pool specifically for fermenting sorghum husks to feed the pigs.
    He remembered that during the famine years in the old society, he had eaten corn cobs. He thought: If people can eat this, why can't pigs? He tried drying some corn cobs, crushing them, and boiling them into a paste in a pot. The pigs also ate it happily. Later, the farm's pig farmers all learned his method, processing sorghum husks and corn cobs as feed for the pigs, saving a lot of grain for the country.
    Qi Fengxiang raises sows. He tries to make them produce more piglets. He can't read and can't read books about pig farming. Once, a sow went into heat. After mating with a local boar, a Berkshire boar ran over and mated with it again. As a result, this sow gave birth to three local piglets and nine Berkshire piglets. People were very curious about this. Qi Fengxiang thought: If the Berkshire boar hadn't mated a second time, it might have only given birth to three local piglets. Could it be that mating twice can result in more piglets? He discussed this question with others and consulted livestock workers. It turned out that this advanced method of double mating had already been implemented in many places in the Soviet Union and China. Qi Fengxiang immediately implemented this advanced breeding method, using another boar to mate with the same sow ten minutes after the first mating. In the past, sows only gave birth to about ten piglets each time with a single mating. After implementing double mating, they could give birth to fifteen to twenty. Since the autumn of last year, all production teams on the farm have implemented the double mating method.
    When sows have more piglets, some teats are not enough, and some piglets can't get milk. Qi Fengxiang makes some flour paste and feeds the piglets while holding them in his arms, and he also takes some piglets to other sows to nurse. One sow had the bad habit of eating piglets. Qi Fengxiang thought of a way to put a "muzzle" on it. In winter and spring, it's cold, and he was afraid that the piglets would freeze to death. Whenever it was windy or snowy, he would take the newborn piglets into the house and put them on his warm kang.
    In the past, the farm leaders often told the pig farmers to maintain good sanitation in the pig pens. But some pig farmers always felt: Can pigs really be clean? When Qi Fengxiang took over, the mud in the pigsty was half a foot deep. When it rained, the pigpen became a pool of water, and the pigs were soaking in the water. Before long, swine fever broke out. Qi Fengxiang felt very sad to see the state's property being damaged, and he was determined to improve the sanitation of the pig pens. He thoroughly renovated the pig pens, added soil every day, and disinfected them with lime water every week. He also built a small separate pen to isolate any sick pigs.
    Qi Fengxiang is not only a good pig farmer, but he also cares about everything and does all kinds of work on the farm as long as he can. When spring plowing is busy, he helps deliver manure; during the autumn harvest, he takes time to pick up grain in the fields. When the cook is sick and no one is cooking, or when the driver is gone and no one is feeding the livestock, people naturally mention, "Let's ask Qi Fengxiang to help!" When working, he is a lively and energetic young man; when managing the household, he is like a careful and frugal old man. If anyone leaves furniture in the yard, he will clean it up. Even some hemp rope ends and broken rubber shoes, he carefully collects and takes them to exchange for matches. Qi Fengxiang has been at the farm for almost nine years and has never been absent from work for a single day. He works tirelessly year-round, treating the farm as his own home.

    养猪员齐凤祥
  　本报记者　林沫
    内蒙古自治区国营乃林农场养有一千多头猪，过去因为饲养管理不好，壮猪养不肥，母猪下仔少；一发生猪瘟，猪就成圈成圈地死，可把农场赔苦了。
    蒙族青年齐凤祥去接手当饲养员的时候，原先那个姓李的饲养员，站在猪圈旁边皱起眉头向他说：“你真是没事干了，来干这，一天同这些东西打交道，有啥出息？”齐凤祥却说：“不论干啥工作都一样，只要干好了，就有出息。”
    “一个圈的猪，喂一样的食，为什么会有的肥，有的瘦呢？”齐凤祥把饲料添到猪槽里，看着猪吃食，心里常常这样想。他很快发现，那些肥壮的猪，先抢着把稠的吃了，那些吃的慢的猪，只能吃些稀汤。从此，他就慢慢试着把猪分为肥壮的、中等的和瘦弱的三种，分群分圈饲养，并且根据猪的体质，配给不同的饲料。对那些瘦弱的猪，不但给好的饲料，喂养也特别细心，这样它们也就慢慢地肥壮起来了。
    过去，农场的养猪员每天给一口大猪要喂二斤半粮食。他们常说：舍不得粮食，就不能见肥猪。但是根据齐凤祥的经验，如果不讲究饲养方法，就是把猪圈在料囤里也还是喂不肥。过去有的养猪员为了省事，每次都是把粮食和粗饲料一下倒在猪槽里。猪都先抢着吃好的，剩下些粗饲料就不爱吃了。这样每次剩下半槽，饲料浪费了，猪也没吃饱。齐凤祥为了让猪吃得好，做到勤添细喂。每顿都是先给稀的，后给稠的，最后撒一把精料。槽里一点不剩，猪也吃足吃饱了。这样，猪的食欲旺盛，消化好，也容易上膘。
    齐凤祥还从各方面找门路为国家节约粮食。有一天，他见耕作队的院子里有一大堆高粱壳子，他就想起过去烧锅坊用酒糟喂猪，不喂粮食也很肥。于是，他就试着把高粱壳子放在大锅里，上面盖一层谷糠，把高粱壳加温发酵后喂猪，猪很爱吃。后来他就仿照作糟的办法，修了一个大砖池子，专门用它发酵高粱壳子喂猪。
    他记得自己在旧社会度荒年，曾吃过玉米心子。他想：这东西人都可以吃，猪就不能吃吗？他试着把一些玉米心子炕干、碾碎，在锅里煮成糊糊，猪也吃得很欢。以后，农场的饲养员都学习他的办法，把高粱壳，玉米瓤加工，当作喂猪的饲料，为国家节约了很多粮食。
    齐凤祥喂养的是母猪。他想办法让它多产猪仔。他不识字，不能阅读关于养猪的书籍。有一次，一只母猪发情了，用本地公猪交配后，又有一只巴克夏种公猪跑去交配一次。结果，这只母猪就下了三只本地猪和九只巴克夏猪。人们对这事很稀奇。齐凤祥就想：要不是后来这只巴克夏种公猪二次交配，可能就只下三只本地猪仔，是不是交配两次就能多下猪仔呢？他拿这问题和别人研究，找畜牧工作人员请教。原来在苏联和中国的许多地方，都已经实行过这种先进的双重交配法。齐凤祥立即实行了这种先进配种方法，第一次交配后十分钟，再用另一只公猪和同一母猪交配。过去，一次交配，母猪每次只下十来个猪仔，实行双重交配以后，可以下十五个到二十个。从去年秋季，全场各生产队都实行了双重交配法。
    母猪下的小猪多了，有的奶头不够，小猪吃不上奶。齐凤祥就做些面糊糊，把小猪仔抱在怀里来喂它，又把一部分小猪抱给别的母猪哺乳。有一口母猪有吃猪仔的恶习。齐凤祥就想办法给它带上“箍嘴”。冬、春天寒，怕把小猪冻死，一遇刮风下雪，他就把刚生下的小猪抱到屋里，放在自己睡的热炕上。
    过去，农场的领导人也常向饲养员讲，要搞好猪的环境卫生。但是有些饲养员心里总觉得：猪这东西，还能干净了吗？当齐凤祥接手工作的时候，猪窝里的尿泥有半尺深。一下雨猪圈就成了水池子，猪都泡在水里。不多日子，就发生了猪瘟。齐凤祥看到国家财产受到损失，心里很难过，他下决心改善猪的环境卫生，把猪圈彻底整修，天天垫土，每星期用石灰水消一次毒。他还另外修了一个小圈，发现病猪就隔离。
    齐凤祥不单是一个很好的养猪员，在农场里，只要是他照顾得到的，什么事都关心，什么活都干。春耕忙的时候，他帮助送粪；秋收的时候，他抽空到地里去捡粮食。炊事员病了没人做饭，赶车的不在了，没人喂牲口，人们会自然地提到：“找齐凤祥来帮助一下吧！”劳动起来，他是个生龙活虎的青年；管起家来，却又像个细心、俭省的老人。谁把家具扔在院子里了，他就收拾起来。就连一些麻绳头啦、破胶鞋啦，他都要经心地收拾起来，拿去换火柴用。齐凤祥到农场快九年了，从来没旷过一天工。他终年孜孜不倦地工作着，把农场当成了自己的家。
