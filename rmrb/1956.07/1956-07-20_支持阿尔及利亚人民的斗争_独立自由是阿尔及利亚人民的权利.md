    Support the Algerian People's Struggle
    Independence and Freedom are the Rights of the Algerian People
    Responsible officials of the French government have repeatedly stated: "The way in which Tunisia and Morocco became independent countries after decades under French protection cannot be applied to Algeria." This cannot but make people feel puzzled. President Sukarno said it well: "Freedom is the inherent right of all mankind." Why shouldn't the Algerian people obtain the sacred right inherent to all mankind – freedom and independence? The African people have awakened, and anyone who intends to continue enslaving the African people will be submerged by the raging waves of anti-colonialism.
    As people and students of a country that was once bullied by imperialism but is now independent and free, I deeply sympathize with and support the just struggle of the Algerian people and students. The French authorities should rein themselves in at the brink of the precipice and resolve the Algerian issue on the basis of recognizing the freedom and independence of the Algerian people.

### 支持阿尔及利亚人民的斗争  独立自由是阿尔及利亚人民的权利

    支持阿尔及利亚人民的斗争
    独立自由是阿尔及利亚人民的权利
    法国政府的负责官员一再声称：“突尼斯和摩洛哥在法国保护下几十年后变成独立国家的方式不能应用于阿尔及利亚。”这不能不使人感到难以理解。苏加诺总统说的好：“自由是全人类生而具有的权利。”阿尔及利亚人民为什么不应该获得人类生而具有的神圣权利——自由和独立呢？非洲人民已经觉醒了，谁如果打算继续奴役非洲人民，反对殖民主义的惊涛骇浪必将把它淹没。
    作为一个过去曾备受帝国主义欺凌而现在已经独立自由的国家的人民和学生，我深切地同情并支持阿尔及利亚人民和学生的正义斗争。法国当局应当悬崖勒马，在承认阿尔及利亚人民自由和独立的基础上解决阿尔及利亚问题。
