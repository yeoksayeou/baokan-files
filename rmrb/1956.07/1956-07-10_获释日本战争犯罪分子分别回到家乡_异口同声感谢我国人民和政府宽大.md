Our correspondent Lan Hai, Tokyo, 9th. When Japanese war criminal Toshitaro Kunimoto landed at Maizuru Port on the 3rd, he immediately approached and embraced his parents upon seeing them, crying bitterly, "Father, Mother, the Chinese people and the Chinese government saved me!" His father, who was over sixty years old, cried loudly, "Son, I will never let you go to war again!"
    The 335 Japanese war criminals released by China have returned to their respective hometowns on the 7th and 8th, amidst joyous welcomes from their families.
    In the past few days, major newspapers across Japan have been filled with news about the reunions of these war criminals and their families. Every newspaper has expressed surprise that they do not say a single bad word about the Chinese government. These newspapers point out that these returning war criminals not only do not speak ill of the Chinese government but also unanimously express their gratitude for the lenient measures of the Chinese people and the Chinese government. They frankly confess the serious crimes they committed in China. They express that, in order to live a peaceful life with their parents and wives, they will resolutely oppose war and strive for Sino-Japanese friendship.
    Arita Hachiro, Chairman of the "Japan National Bereaved Families Association," said in a statement on July 8: "Not only the bereaved families, but all Japanese people are grateful for the Chinese government's lenient measures in releasing war criminals ahead of schedule and allowing bereaved families to visit China. We are deeply grateful for the kindness of the Chinese Red Cross in providing information regarding the list of missing Japanese persons during the war, and we ask for continued assistance."
    Arita also said: "Although diplomatic relations between China and Japan have not yet been normalized due to various obstacles, I believe that with the efforts of the people of both China and Japan and the changes in the world situation, the opportunity for normalization of diplomatic relations will soon arrive."

    获释日本战争犯罪分子分别回到家乡
    异口同声感谢我国人民和政府宽大
    本报记者蓝海东京9日电　日本战争犯罪分子国友俊太郎三日在舞鹤港上岸时，见到来迎接的父母，立即走近拥抱，并痛哭流涕地说：“爸爸、妈妈，中国人民和中国人民政府救了我。”已经六十多岁的父亲放声大哭说：“孩子，决不让你再去打仗了！”
    中国释放的335个日本战争犯罪分子，已分别在七日和八日两天，在家族欢天喜地的迎接中回到自己的家乡。
    这几天，日本全国各地的大报纸，充满了关于这些战争犯罪分子和家族见面的消息。每家报纸都对他们不说中国政府的一句坏话表示惊讶。这些报纸指出：这些回国战争犯罪分子不但不说中国政府的坏话，反而异口同声地感谢中国人民和中国人民政府的宽大措施。他们毫不隐讳地坦白出在中国犯过怎样的严重罪行。他们表示：今后为了能够同父母妻子度过和平的生活，要坚决反对战争，并为中日友好而努力。
    “日本全国留守家族会”会长有田八郎在七月八日发表谈话说：“不单是留守家族，所有的日本人民都感谢中国政府提前释放战犯和允许留守家族前往中国访问的宽大措施。关于战争中一部分不知下落的日本人名簿，蒙中国红十字会的厚意，提供资料，我们深深地表示感谢，并请继续给与协助。”
    有田还说：“虽然中日两国邦交因种种障碍还没正常化，但我相信，有中日两国人民的努力和世界情势的变化，邦交正常化的时机不久一定会到来。”
