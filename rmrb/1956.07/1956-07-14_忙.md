    "Busy"
    Yu Jin
    In the socialist construction, everyone is busy.

    There is a type of person who especially likes to keep the word "busy" on their lips. Busy! Busy! No matter when or where, you can hear them saying "busy." However, in reality, they spend more time talking about how "busy" they are than actually working or studying; they are "busy people" who are busy talking about being "busy."

    Busy and idle are very easy to distinguish. One is certainly clear about whether one is busy or idle; it's not a case of "the onlooker sees more than the players," where one is so "confused" that one's words become inverted. The reason for this is due to some inexplicable ideas at play.

    One idea is: Everyone is busy now, so how can I say I'm not busy? Thus, others are actually busy, while one is verbally busy. Saying it over and over again, an idle person becomes a "busy person," not busy becomes "very busy," and one is even complacent, not finding it strange.

    Another idea is: Being busy signifies a heavy workload; a heavy workload shows the importance of one's work. Thus, the "finishing touch" method is adopted, using the single word "busy" to encompass everything one wants to express, making others see how extraordinary one's work is!

    However, words ultimately cannot replace reality. Regardless of the reason for deliberately saying "busy," apart from empty talk, there will never be any real gains.

    Let's take a simple example: If workers want to build a large building, if they just shout at the empty ground: I'm busy tying steel bars! I'm busy pouring cement! Then the empty ground will forever remain empty ground. To erect a building on the empty ground, one must truly start tying steel bars and pouring cement, and only through much real labor can one achieve the desired goal.

    All of our work is indispensable to the socialist construction. To achieve the overall goal, we must make a concerted effort in different positions. Those who are not busy at work should find ways to make themselves busy, should not "steal leisure from busyness," and even more should not use "busy" to show off. We are not busy for the sake of being busy, but to be busy with a definite effect. Therefore, empty talk of "busy" is useless; we must work honestly. All those who say "busy," please show some real work achievements!

    “忙”
    余今
    在社会主义建设事业中，大家都在忙。
    有一种人，特别喜欢把这个“忙”字经常地挂在嘴上。忙呀！忙呀！不论在什么时候和什么地方，都听得见他在说“忙”。不过，在实际上，他忙于说自己“忙”的时候多，忙于工作或学习的时候少，而是个忙于说“忙”的“忙人”。
    忙和闲，这是非常容易分别的。自己的忙闲，自己当然清楚，并非“当局者迷”，“迷”得自己在说法上发生了颠倒。所以如此，是由于有些莫名其妙的想法作怪。
    想法之一是：现在大家都很忙，自己怎好说不忙呢？于是，别人实际忙，自己口头忙，说来说去，闲人变成“忙人”，不忙变成“很忙”，而且俨然自得，不以为异了。
    想法之二是：忙，标志着工作的繁重；工作繁重，显示了自己工作的重要。于是，采用“画龙点睛”法，以一个“忙”字，概括了自己所要表现的一切。使别人看着：自己的工作是怎样的不简单！
    可是，口头毕竟代替不了实际。不论由于那一种原因而故意的说“忙”，除过空话以外，决不会有任何确实的收获。
    试以浅显的事物做为例证：工人要修建一座大厦，如果只是对着平地空喊：我扎钢筋忙呀！我灌水泥忙呀！这样，平地将永远是平地。要使平地上树立起楼房，必须真正动手去扎钢筋、灌水泥，经过许多确实的劳动，才可以达到所要达到的目的。
    我们的一切工作，都是社会主义建设事业中不可缺少的工作。为了达到总的目的，我们必须在不同的岗位上做共同的努力。在工作中不忙的人，应当设法使自己忙起来，不应“忙里偷闲”，更不应拿“忙”来炫耀自己。我们不是为忙而忙，而是要忙出一定的效果。因此，“忙”的空话是没有用处的，必须老老实实地工作。一切说“忙”的人，请拿出些真正的工作成绩吧！
