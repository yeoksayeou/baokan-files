    The Writer's "Subjectivity" and the Work's "Objectivity"
    ——On the Worldview of the Author of "The Story of the Pipa" and Realistic Creation

                                    I
    Gao Zecheng's "The Story of the Pipa" has been widely known for hundreds of years, and to this day, it is still warmly welcomed by a large audience in the traditional repertoire of various local operas. However, such a drama welcomed by the people was also welcomed by the feudal ruling class. In its early circulation, it was praised by Zhu Yuanzhang, the founding emperor of the early Ming Dynasty. Zhu Yuanzhang said: "The Five Classics and Four Books are like the five grains, indispensable to every family. Gao Ming's 'The Story of the Pipa' is like a delicacy, how can the wealthy families lack it?" Both the people and the rulers admired and appreciated it, which formed the focus of the debate on its evaluation for hundreds of years. In recent years, some drama history works and commentaries have shown a negative trend. The reasons are all concentrated on Gao Zecheng's exoneration of Cai Bojie, distorting the folk legends and changing the "Zhao Zhennü and Cai Erlang" of the "Song and Yuan Old Plays" in nature. The original tragic karma of "Ma Tramples Zhao Wuniang, Lightning Strikes Cai Bojie" was adapted into a happy ending of "Virtuous and Loyal Zhao Zhennü, Completely Loyal and Filial Cai Bojie" in "The Story of the Pipa". In particular, the purpose of Gao Zecheng's feudal ethical preaching in the "Deputy Role Opening" of advocating "It doesn't matter about morality, it's in vain even if it's good," and "Just look at filial sons and virtuous wives" has become the target of critics.
    However, the fundamental characteristic of literature and art is to embody thought through artistic images. In the writer's complex labor process, because the "reality" of the reflected and created works expresses the true and complex appearance of real life to a certain extent or height, the embodiment of the writer's subjective intention in the works is very complex and tortuous. Sometimes, it itself presents opposing contradictions. For such works, it is impossible to draw correct conclusions if only one aspect is grasped and simply affirmed or denied. Instead, it is necessary to specifically analyze the contradictions that exist in it and explore and study the value of these works through the phenomena of these contradictions.
    Undoubtedly, "The Story of the Pipa" is indeed shrouded in a strong atmosphere of feudal preaching. It promotes feudal "filial piety" and praises the "virtue" of women actively advocated by feudal ethics. However, the actual performance of the work, to a large extent, also exposes the tyranny and dominance of the feudal ruling class and accuses the hypocrisy and cruelty of feudal human relationships. At the same time, even in its feudal preaching, there are still profound contradictions that need to be carefully analyzed. On the surface, the author seems to be praising "complete loyalty and complete filial piety" (which may be the reason why Zhu Yuanzhang praised it!), but from the actual look of the work, it is obvious that it shows the self-contradiction of the feudal preaching of "loyalty and filial piety cannot be both." The author affirmed filial piety and denied loyalty. From this description of affirmation and denial, the sin of feudal ethics is ruthlessly criticized. Not only that, but even in the filial piety praised by the author, it is not only feudalism's filial piety. It also shows different content in different characters. In the image of Zhao Wuniang, her filial piety and virtue have surpassed the hypocritical feudal ethical relations, showing the inherent goodness of the people in daring to sacrifice themselves, and promoting the humanitarian love of sympathy. In the image of Cai Bojie, the contradiction between loyalty and filial piety is also intertwined with the pessimistic idea of feudal scholar-officials giving up their official careers and the contradiction between the ideal of flying to the top created by feudal education. Only in the idealized character created by the author – the Niu family – does "filial piety" and "virtue" truly show a strong color of feudal ethical preaching.
    The so-called "complete loyalty and complete filial piety," if not viewed from the author's declaration but from the objective effect of art, the grand finale of "a family being praised" in "The Story of the Pipa" does not cover up the essence of this tragedy in the feudal era but exposes the hypocrisy and cruelty of the feudal system. This objective exposure and accusation was once exposed by insightful people in the feudal era. Chen Meigong pointed out very cleverly in the end of his annotation: "The tomb-dwelling is commended, and there is nothing more to scold!" Therefore, in such a work with complex and contradictory ideological content, if only a one-sided generalization of so-called "virtuous people and beautiful deeds" is made and it is simply attributed to a typical feudal preaching play, discarding the dross and also discarding the essence, it is difficult to convince the broad audience who love "The Story of the Pipa".
                             II
    Those who regard "The Story of the Pipa" as a typical feudal preaching play, in addition to using the author's preaching tendency and Zhu Yuanzhang's praise as the basis, also have an important basis: the remaining folk legends and the fragments of the so-called "Song and Yuan Old Plays".
    (1) Lu You's poem: "The setting sun and ancient willows, Zhao's village, a blind old man is performing with a drum, who cares about the right and wrong after his death, the whole village listens to Cai Zhonglang."
      (2) The "Southern Drama Narrative" has a note under the "Zhao Zhennü and Cai Erlang" drama listed in the old Song and Yuan plays: "It is Cai Bojie who abandoned his parents and betrayed his wife and was struck to death by thunder, which is a fabricated story by the local customs. It is actually the head of opera."
      (3) Modern Peking Opera: The aria in "Little Tomb Sweeping" has: "There is also the virtuous Wuniang trampled by a horse, and later Cai Bojie was struck by five thunders."
    These three fragments mentioning the past legends of "The Story of the Pipa" naturally vaguely show some differences in the plot and character of the characters from "The Story of the Pipa". Judging from their structure and ending, they seem to be the same type of story as "Qin Xianglian" and "Capturing Wang Kui Alive". Many ancient writers have drawn from the people's creation and re-created on the basis of this "source". For such works, they cannot be dismissed in general or simply said that they are "scholar-official writers who tampered with the original work". Instead, it should be regarded as an independent creation and evaluated from its entire content and ideological inclination. The most attacked part of "The Story of the Pipa" is the image of Cai Bojie. Cai Bojie in "The Story of the Pipa" and its prototype Cai Erlang are characters with different personalities. From the author's subjective intention, Gao Zecheng did consciously exonerate Cai Bojie. It should be admitted that this is a creative development of the "Zhao Zhennü and Cai Erlang" story. He wanted to prove that Cai Bojie was innocent in this tragedy, but because this subjective intention did not achieve a complete expression of artistic truth, there were many factual inaccuracies in the details of this "innocent person." For example, why didn't Cai Bojie mention that he already had a wife in his resignation? Why didn't he welcome and support his parents or communicate with his family after marrying into the Niu family? And why didn't his family know anything after Cai Bojie passed the imperial examination? These all damaged the integrity of the character image and weakened the expression of realistic art. However, if viewed from the main mental state of Cai Bojie, it must be admitted that it has a certain typical significance.
      “Ten years of study by lamplight, discussing high talent and peerless learning, not boasting like Ban Gu and Sima Qian; in the days of peace and prosperity, a fine horse wants to gallop, a fish wants to turn into a dragon." This is originally an ideal of intellectuals nurtured by feudal education. It is not surprising that a character like Cai Bojie has such an ideal. However, this ideal does not occupy a major position in Cai Bojie's personality. We abandon those feudal preaching such as "human titles are not as noble as heavenly titles, and fame is not as good as filial piety." The three acts of Cai Bojie not following orders also reveal reasonable life aspirations. Especially the psychological contradictions before and after resigning from marriage and officialdom vividly show the complex character of a feudal scholar. After reluctant farewell after a sweet new marriage, he suddenly encounters the incident of the Prime Minister's family proposing marriage, and he will naturally refuse with righteous indignation:
  "Stop entangling with wild vines, I have my own dodder, relatives by marriage, who is provoking it for no reason, don't waste your breath." However, it is unimaginable for a person who "is happy to have made contributions in the first battle, and grateful for the emperor's grace in reporting the triumphant words" not to be reluctant to leave "the world at this time is a fish turning into a dragon, leaving the Qionglin, with endless beautiful scenery". So no matter how the author enriches and develops the inner pain of Cai Bojie's character, in the true artistic depiction, this mentally contradictory character is gradually developing and changing. The satisfactory marriage with the Prime Minister's family, initially refused but eventually accepted, the so-called "locked up like a phoenix, when will I be able to go home, I don't blame him, the only thing is that I shouldn't have come to Chang'an to see the flowers, scaring my parents." It is just a weak defense. The sentimental mood of "It's a pity that the new people are laughing and talking, but they don't know that my old people are crying" cannot cover up the joyful mood of "climbing the osmanthus tree and walking on the moon palace, unexpectedly the dodder is on a tall tree, rejoicing in the book, today there is a daughter like jade, worth seeing is the silk curtain pulling the red, it is exactly the lotus clothing wearing green". It was like this at the beginning of the marriage, and when he was settled in the luxurious life of the Prime Minister's mansion, he would naturally have the complex feeling of "the old string is broken, the new string is not used to, the old string cannot be put on again, and it is difficult to give up the new string".
    The author's portrayal of Cai Bojie's inner contradictions is quite true and profound. The author has painted a vivid portrait of a type of intellectual in the feudal era. However, no matter what extent the author's efforts have reached, he cannot save Cai Bojie's fate. The image of Cai Bojie cannot arouse the audience's sympathy and love, but more often arouses the audience's contempt, because one of the issues closely related to this image is his affection for his parents, but the author only used some exaggerated and embellished words, lacking the true expression of artistic life. However, despite this, the author has achieved another effect in artistic creation. Although people despise Cai Bojie's character, they do not focus their hatred on him but turn their hatred towards tyrannical rulers such as the feudal emperor and Prime Minister Niu through this character. Only those who create feudal ethical codes are the most unprincipled people.
    It is difficult to see what the "real" Cai Bojie of the so-called "Song and Yuan Old Plays" looked like from the past surviving records. Therefore, saying that Gao Zecheng's "The Story of the Pipa" distorts the original work by shaping Cai Bojie into a contradictory character, that it is feudal preaching, and that the tragedy of cause and effect retribution of "Ma Tramples Zhao Wuniang, Lightning Strikes Cai Bojie" is regarded as something of "high people's nature" is also an empty and extreme view. In the study of classical literature, there has always been a view that everything folk is superior to the creation of writers. Whenever writers draw on folk legends for processing and creation, they are always classified as second-rate products. Even if the folk original work is only a trace of record, a pyramid must be built for it in imagination. If you carefully distinguish it, I am afraid that both cause and effect retribution and feudal preaching are dross that must be eliminated, and there is no imaginary difference in superiority or inferiority.
    What shows a clear color of feudal preaching from the content to the expression of artistic image is the character of Niu. If it is said that for the character creation of Zhao Wuniang, although the author also tried his best to render it with the color of feudal ethical preaching, but due to the power of real life, and the life experience of Zhao Wuniang's prototype of the lower class people, and her own virtues, even though she is wearing a coat of feudal ethical preaching, she can't cover up her rich and distinct characteristics of people's character after all. Then, Niu is completely the incarnation of feudal ethics and the mouthpiece of feudal preaching. In order to make his ideal character a typical "virtuous wife," the author has endowed her with almost all the idealized qualities of the feudal class. Niu received strict feudal education from her father, "gentle and dignified," and turned a deaf ear to all the temptations from the outside world, so-called "Even with a thousand worries and a hundred kinds of spring sorrows, it's hard to get on my brow," "Let the spring colors be year after year, my heart is still the same"; on the occasion of forced marriage, she stood on the righteous position and opposed her father: "Too much, what my father is doing, only asking for strength, not caring about people's opinions at all"; and when she married Cai Bojie, she became a gentle and obedient virtuous wife who sang and followed her husband; when she learned of Cai Bojie's thoughts, she asked her father to return to her hometown with her husband, and also accused her father of injustice: "My father is in the position of Prime Minister, how can you say words that hurt customs and morality and are unreasonable," and even declared to Cai Bojie because her father did not allow her to return home:
  "I am willing to give up my body, fulfill his filial piety, and save his parents"; when she met Zhao Wuniang, she had no jealousy and blamed herself: "I am willing to let her, live under her", and finally abandoned her glory and wealth, returned to her hometown with her husband, and fulfilled her filial piety of "ancestral graves must be guarded together".
    This character, from thought to life, is all the author's idealized decoration and rendering, lacking both a realistic foundation and the breath of life. However, even on such a character, due to the author's realistic power in artistic image creation, the artistic feeling formed in the audience's mind is still different from the author's subjective intention. In contrast to Niu, the author concentratedly created two characters full of life breath in "Niu's Rules for Servants" - Grandma and Xichun. Obviously, the author's subjective intention is to reflect the "virtue" and "nobility" of Niu through the "vulgar" life ideals and "frivolous" actions of these two characters. However, contrary to the author's expectations, it is Grandma and Xichun who actually arouse the audience's sympathy and love.
      Grandma, of "old age," "unsuitable for thousands and ten thousands, I did not plant blessings in my previous life, my parents sent me to the Prime Minister's mansion to be a maid, I have been old this year, and I have never been able to show a smile." She buried her youth and her life in the Prime Minister's mansion, which is a prison on earth. Young Xichun is following the same path that Grandma took back then. At a young age, she was locked in this prison with "layers of courtyards". Even "spring" is not allowed to be "hurt," "men are not allowed to" "look up," and even the flowers and willows in the garden are not allowed to be admired. When the old master is not there, she occasionally goes to the garden to play, and she is also blamed. Through the lives and experiences of these two characters, we see how the female slaves of the oppressed class in the feudal era were deprived of their youth and happiness under the norms of feudal ethics. What they yearn for is only "to be able to dance with a husband like wild geese in one place," but they can never get it in their lifetime. Lively Xichun and humorous Grandma are the real and vivid characters. They have reasonable life ideals, and they have fantasies and desires to pursue a better life. What the artistic image shows is exactly the opposite of the author's subjective intention. The description of these characters in contrast does not achieve the purpose of praising feudal ethics. On the contrary, it vividly shows the essence of cannibalistic ethics and shows the ruthlessness and inhumanity of the "pine and bamboo integrity, orchid-like mind" that the author praised. The artistic effect is that in the minds of the audience, sympathy and love are aroused for Grandma and Xichun, while they feel pale and pitiful for that idealized Niu.
    Niu and Prime Minister Niu also have a contrasting effect in image. The author's attitude towards Prime Minister Niu is to expose him. Prime Minister Niu is the root of the disaster who "makes disasters as big as the sky just because he did not follow three orders." "Resigning from marriage is not allowed", "Resigning from officialdom is not allowed", exposing his tyranny and shamelessness. He does not allow his son-in-law to return to his hometown to visit his parents, and he does not allow his daughter to return to her hometown with her husband. Even after his son-in-law and daughter left, he pretended to be a praiser of filial piety: "I am now going to submit a report to the court to report the filial piety of the Cai family, and the emperor will be sure to issue a red decree to summon him", exposing his selfishness and hypocrisy. The author wants to highlight the idealized virtue of Niu through the contrast between Niu and Prime Minister Niu. However, precisely in this artistic expression, the hypocrisy of feudal ethical preaching is revealed. Prime Minister Niu educates his daughter with the three obediences and four virtues, and the integrity of pine and bamboo. The facts show that these feudal ethical norms are only of educational significance to him and can only obey his interests. When reality violates his interests, feudal ethical norms can also be completely ignored.
    Naturally, what particularly shows that the realistic artistic expression ability weakens the author's subjective feudal ethical preaching role is the characteristic artistic structure of the entire drama of "The Story of the Pipa". The author is not only good at revealing the contradictions of life through the contrast of character personalities but also good at using strong and distinct contrasting scenes to unfold dramatic conflicts on the stage image. From the seventh scene "Talented Young Man Sets Out" to the thirty-second scene "Hardships on the Road," the plot and conflict of the drama, which occupy most of the play, are carried out in alternating scenes of two extreme opposites. One scene is Cai Bojie's experience in the capital, and the other scene is Zhao Wuniang's life changes in her hometown. The author's subjective intention, or as Aoki Masaru said: "To regulate the misery of the Cai family's life with the comfort and luxury of life in the Niu's mansion, so that the audience does not become extremely sad", or it is to express the pain and misery of longing for each other in two places and life experiences in two places. However, due to this vivid description of the vast disparity between the rich and the poor, it has reached the point of accusing the crimes of the luxurious enjoyment of the feudal ruling class, and exposing the hungry and miserable lives of the exploited people behind this luxurious enjoyment. There is no classical drama that expresses the two extremes of life of the so-called "vermilion gates smell of wine and meat, and there are frozen bones on the road" more truly and profoundly than "The Story of the Pipa". It is precisely in this shocking and distinct contrast of artistic images that the audience's sympathy and love for Zhao Wuniang, hatred for the feudal rulers, and contempt and disgust for Cai Bojie are more deeply aroused.
    Judging from this complex and contradictory phenomenon shown by the artistic image of "The Story of the Pipa", it is undeniable that Gao Zecheng's artistic creation has a profound contradiction between his worldview and his realistic creation. This is by no means an empty dogma, but "The Story of the Pipa" does have complex content that needs to be specifically analyzed.
                            III
    Explaining the profound contradiction between Gao Zecheng's worldview and his realistic creation shown in "The Story of the Pipa" from the main aspects does not mean that Gao Zecheng's worldview is completely reactionary, but that he only achieved the success of
  "The Story of the Pipa" by virtue of expressing the truth of life. It is impossible for us to imagine that a writer can create realistic works if all his views on understanding real life are reactionary. Gao Zecheng's preaching for feudal ethical ideas in "The Story of the Pipa" is reactionary, feudalistic, and attempts to maintain the feudal system by praising feudal ethical relations. However, not all aspects of his understanding of real life stand on a strictly feudalistic position. The theme of "The Story of the Pipa" is complex. In addition to the aspect of preaching feudal ethics, there is also a central idea that permeates the entire play, that is, the question of the way out for feudal scholar-officials. This idea is also intertwined with the development of the entire tragedy. The so-called "three disobediences" are, in form, a
  "filial piety" preaching, but in essence, it shows the end of being obsessed with fame and wealth through the whole artistic image. In the author's mind, the significance of Cai Bojie as a tragic image is that he did not adhere to the ideal of "fame is not my intention", so that he was "trapped by fame and wealth, firmly entangled in the corners of the world", and "made disasters as big as the sky". This idea of ​​disheartening official career and non-cooperation with the rulers is closely related to the author's political views. Aoki Masaru appropriately evaluated Gao Zecheng's ideological tendency reflected through Cai Bojie: "The Story of the Pipa is actually a divine masterpiece in which a talented writer in a chaotic world expresses his dissatisfaction in words." Gao Zecheng's "official biography" in the "Ruian County Annals", which records his life experience, can provide us with clues to explore this idea. Gao Zecheng had been an official of the Yuan Dynasty, but he was clean and upright, not only "compromisingly protecting and adjusting for the people's peace" in front of the "greedy and cruel" dignitaries but also able to "interrogate and send away all prisoners without verification" when he "changed his transfer to the Siming Dutong of the Zhejiang East Border Command." And he dared to "repeatedly offend the dignitaries." His experience as a person and an official is probably the reason for forming his idea of ​​disheartening official career and non-cooperation with the rulers. His action of "Emperor Ming Taizu heard his name and summoned him, but he resigned due to old age" further shows that this person had elements of resisting feudal rule to a certain extent. The ideas that permeate "The Story of the Pipa" also entrust the author's political views and life ideals. If he did not have opposing views on many unreasonable things in feudal society, and if he did not have an understanding and love for the good qualities of the lower class people, he would never have been able to adopt and adhere to realism, especially to create such a beautiful female image as Zhao Wuniang.
    Some people say that the reason why the character of Zhao Wuniang was successful in "The Story of the Pipa" is that Gao Zecheng retained the prototype of folk legends in her. Some people also say that Gao Zecheng might as well not write "The Story of the Pipa". If he wants to write "The Story of the Pipa", he must write Zhao Wuniang truthfully. I think these views make some sense. Niu is an example. Gao Zecheng originally created Niu as an ideal character. However, because it lacks a realistic foundation and the true life, in the minds of the audience, it is only a conceptual shadow of feudal preaching. However, the relationship between the writer and his characters is complex. Especially a character like Zhao Wuniang. She is
  the soul of "The Story of the Pipa". If the quality of Zhao Wuniang and her life experience are not the crystallization of Gao Zecheng's deep observation and understanding of real life, it is difficult for us to imagine that he can create such a true and moving image,
    As a beautiful female type, Zhao Wuniang's hard work, kindness, loyalty, generosity, and spirit of daring to take on all difficulties, as well as her tragic life experience, are the common character and fate of hundreds of millions of women in China in the feudal era. Although Gao Zecheng also tried to render this character with the color of feudal preaching, due to his profound insight, true life experience, and love for this character, the realistic qualities of it are summarized more deeply and higher, and scenes such as "Providing Relief in the Righteous Granary", "Encouraging the Stepmother to Eat", and "Self-pity for Rough Food" are written, which are called "divine works." In this way, the role of its feudal preaching is greatly weakened.
    Judging from the whole play, along with the development of the entire plot, Gao Zecheng also exposed the unreasonable reality of feudal society to a considerable extent. The exposure and ridicule of officialdom life and the imperial examination system, and the spicy description of the feudal officials' cruel exploitation of the people and embezzlement of disaster relief grain in "Providing Relief in the Righteous Granary" obviously show the author's bold critical views and angry feelings, and it cannot be said that they have nothing to do with the writer's worldview.
    All of this shows that Gao Zecheng not only had a profound contradiction between his worldview and his realistic creation, but also that his worldview itself had complex and contradictory elements. It is precisely because he has reactionary elements and progressive elements close to the people in all his views on understanding real life that the creation of his artistic image presents a complex phenomenon. I think that specifically analyzing and studying these phenomena is not only of great significance for clarifying the value of "The Story of the Pipa" but also will greatly promote the research and exploration of many principles in literary and artistic theory.

    作家的“主观”和作品的“客观”
    ——谈“琵琶记”作者的世界观和现实主义创作
    李希凡
                                    一
    高则诚的“琵琶记”，脍炙人口达数百年之久，至今在各种地方戏曲的传统剧目中，还受到广大观众的热烈欢迎。但是，这样一个受到人民欢迎的剧目，却也受到封建统治阶级的欢迎。在它流传的初期，就受到明初开国皇帝朱元璋的推崇。朱元璋说：“五经四书如五谷，家家不可缺。高明琵琶记如珍羞百味，富贵家岂可缺耶？”人民和统治者都推崇它，欣赏它，这也就形成几百年来对它评价分歧的焦点。近年来，一些戏剧史著作和评论文章中，却表现着一种否定的趋向。理由都集中在高则诚替蔡伯喈翻案，歪曲了民间传说，使“宋元旧篇”的“赵贞女蔡二郎”变了质。本来是“马踹赵五娘，雷击蔡伯喈”的果报悲剧，在“琵琶记”里，却被改编成“有贞有烈赵贞女，全忠全孝蔡伯喈”的大团圆结局。尤其高则诚在“副末开场”中所标榜的“不关风化体，纵好也徒然”，“只看子孝共妻贤”的封建伦理说教的目的，更加成了批评家的矛头所向。
    但是，文学艺术的根本特征，是通过艺术形象来体现思想。在作家复杂的劳动过程里，由于所反映和创造的作品的“现实”，在一定程度上或一定高度上表现着现实生活的真实的复杂面貌，因此，作家的主观意图在作品中的体现，就表现得非常复杂和曲析，有时它本身就呈现出对立的矛盾。对于这样的作品，如果只抓住其中的一个片面，进行简单的肯定或否定，都不可能得出正确的结论。而是必须具体地分析它所存在的矛盾，透过这些矛盾的现象，来探讨和研究这些作品的价值。
    无疑问的，笼罩着“琵琶记”的，确实是浓重的封建说教气氛。它宣传了封建的“孝道”，歌颂了封建礼教所积极提倡的妇女的“贤慧”。然而，作品的实际表现，却在很大程度上也暴露了封建统治阶级的专横、霸道，控诉了封建人间关系的虚伪和残酷。同时，即使是在它的封建说教里，也还是存在着深刻的矛盾，需要很好地进行具体分析。表面看起来，作者似乎是在歌颂“全忠全孝”（这也许是朱元璋推崇它的原因吧！），而从作品的实际看起来，很显然，是表现了“忠孝不能两全”的封建说教的自相矛盾。作者是肯定了孝而否定了忠的。从这种肯定和否定的描写里，无情地批判了封建礼教的罪恶。不但这样，就是在作者歌颂的孝里，也还不只是封建主义的孝道，它在不同的人物身上也表现着不同的内容。在赵五娘的形象里，她的孝和贤，已经超越了虚伪的封建伦理关系，表现了人民固有的勇于自我牺牲的善良品质，高扬着人道主义的同情的爱。在蔡伯喈的形象里，忠孝不能两全的矛盾，还交织着封建士大夫的灰心仕途的出世思想，与封建教育所造成的“骅骝欲骋，鱼龙将化”的飞黄腾达的理想的矛盾。只有在作者所塑造的一个理想化的人物——牛氏身上，“孝”和“贤”，才真正表现了浓厚的封建伦理说教的色彩。
    所谓“全忠全孝”，如果不从作者的宣言，而从艺术的客观效果来看，“琵琶记”的“一门旌奖”的大团圆结局，并没有掩盖住封建时代这个悲剧的本质，反而暴露了封建制度的虚伪和残酷。这种客观的暴露和控诉，在封建时代就曾被有识者揭破过。陈眉公在他的批语的最后，就十分机智地指出过：“庐墓旌表，骂到无可骂处矣！”因此，在这样一部交织着复杂矛盾的思想内容的作品里，如果只进行所谓“人贤事美”的片面的概括，而把它简单地归结为典型的封建说教戏，弃其糟粕，也弃其精华，是很难说服喜爱琵琶记的广大观众的。
                             二
    把“琵琶记”看成典型的封建说教戏的人，除去以作者的说教倾向和朱元璋的推崇作为依据，还有一个重要的依据，是残存的民间传说和所谓“宋元旧篇”的断片。
    （1）陆游诗：“斜阳古柳赵家庄，负鼓盲翁正作场，身后是非谁管得，满村听唱蔡中郎。”
      （2）“南词叙录”在列举的宋元旧篇的“赵贞女蔡二郎”一剧下有注：“即蔡伯喈弃亲背妇，为暴雷震死，里俗妄作也，实为戏文之首。”
      （3）近代皮黄剧：“小上坟”中的唱词有：“也有贤慧的五娘遭马踹，到后来五雷轰顶是那蔡伯喈。”
    这三段提到过去传说的“琵琶记”的断片，自然都模糊地显示着和“琵琶记”的情节与人物性格有所不同。从它们的结构和结局看来，似乎和“秦香莲”、“活捉王魁”是同一类型的故事。许多古代作家都汲取了人民的创作，并在这个“源泉”的基础上进行再创造。对于这样的作品，不能一概予以抹煞，或者简单地说它是“士大夫文人篡改了原作”。而要把它看成独立的创作，从它的整个内容和思想倾向上进行评价。“琵琶记”最受到攻击的，是蔡伯喈的形象。“琵琶记”中的蔡伯喈，和它的原型蔡二郎，是性格不同的人物。从作者的主观意图来探讨，高则诚确实是有意识地替蔡伯喈翻案。应该承认，这是对于“赵贞女蔡二郎，”故事的一种独创性的发展，他想证明在这个悲剧中蔡伯喈是无罪的，但由于这种主观意图，并没有取得艺术真实的完整的表现，在这个“无罪的人”的身上，却有很多细节上的不真实。像蔡伯喈为什么在辞表中不提已有糟糠之妻？为什么在入赘牛府后不迎养双亲，不和家中通信？而蔡伯喈中状元后，家中也竟一无所知？这些都损害了这个人物形象的完整，削弱了现实主义艺术的表现力量。然而，如果从蔡伯喈的主要精神状态来看，却又不能不承认，它有着一定的典型意义。
      “十载亲灯火，论高才绝学，休夸班马；风云太平日，正骅骝欲骋，鱼龙将化”。这本是封建教育哺育出来的知识分子的一种理想。像蔡伯喈这样一个人物，有这样的理想是不足为怪的。可是，这种理想在蔡伯喈的性格里，并不占据着主要地位。我们舍弃了那些“人爵不如天爵贵，功名争似孝名高”的封建说教，在蔡伯喈三不从的行动里，也透露着合理的人生愿望。尤其是辞婚辞官前后的心理矛盾，生动地表现了一个封建书生的复杂性格。燕尔新婚依恋惜别之后，忽然遭遇到相府提亲的事件，他自然会理直气壮地给以拒绝：
  “野蔓休缠也，俺自有正兔丝，亲瓜葛，是谁人无端调引，漫劳饶舌。”但是，一个“喜鳌头一战有功，荷君恩奏捷词锋”的人，能不留恋“人间此时鱼化龙，留取琼林，胜景无穷”，却是不可想像的。所以不管作者怎样在蔡伯喈性格的内在痛苦上充实和发展它，而在真实的艺术描写里，这个精神矛盾的人物却是逐渐在发展和变化。称心如意的相府婚姻初拒而终从，所谓“鸾拘凤束，甚日得到家，我也休怨他，这其间只是我不合来长安看花，闪杀我爹娘也。”只不过是无力的辩护之词。“可惜新人笑语喧，不知我旧人哭”的感伤情绪，终究也掩盖不住“攀桂步蟾宫，岂料丝萝在乔木，喜书中，今朝有女如玉，堪观处丝幙牵红，恰正是荷衣穿绿”的得意心情。初婚时就已如此，到安然于豪华的相府生活的时候，自然会产生“旧弦已断，新弦不惯，旧弦再上不能，待撇了新弦难拚”的复杂感情。
    作者对于蔡伯喈内心矛盾的刻画，是相当真实和深刻的，作者为封建时代知识分子的一种类型画了一幅生动的画像。但是，不管作者的努力达到了什么样的程度，他却挽回不了蔡伯喈的命运。蔡伯喈的形象，不能激起观众的同情和喜爱，更多地是引起了观众的轻蔑，因为与这个形象密切相关的一个问题是他对父母的感情，作者却只用了一些夸张的粉饰的词句，而缺乏艺术生命的真实表现。然而，尽管如此，作者在艺术创造上，却达到了另外一个效果，人们虽然轻蔑蔡伯喈的为人，却没把憎恨集中在他的身上，而是透过这个人物，把憎恨转向封建皇帝和牛相这类专横暴虐的统治者。只有那些制造封建伦理纲常的人，才是最没有天理的人。
    所谓“宋元旧篇”的“真正”的蔡伯喈，究竟是什么样的精神面貌，从过去残存的断片记载里，很难看出一个轮廓来。因此，说高则诚的“琵琶记”把蔡伯喈塑造成一个矛盾型的人物，就是歪曲了原作，就是封建说教，把“马踹赵五娘，雷击蔡伯喈”的因果报应的悲剧，就看成“高度人民性”的东西，也未免是一种驾空的偏激的看法。在古典文学研究中，一向就流行着这样一种看法：凡是民间的都是高于作家创作的。凡是作家汲取了民间传说的素材进行加工创造，总是被列为次等产品，即使民间原作只是蛛丝马迹的记载，也要从假想中替它建筑金字塔。如果认真地辨别一下，恐怕因果报应和封建说教，都是必须剔除的糟粕，其中并没有什么假想的高下之分。
    从内容到艺术形象的表现、显示了鲜明的封建说教色彩的，是牛氏这个人物。如果说，对于赵五娘的性格创造，作者虽然也竭尽心力地给它渲染了封建伦理说教的色彩，但由于生活真实的威力，和赵五娘原型的下层人民的生活遭遇，和她本身具有的美德，使它虽然披着封建伦理说教的外衣，也终究掩饰不住她的丰富的鲜明的人民性格的特征。那么，牛氏就完全是封建伦理的化身，封建说教的传声筒。作者为了使他的理想人物成为“贤妻”的典型，几乎把封建阶级一切理想化的品质都赋与它了。牛氏受了父亲严格的封建教育，“娴静端庄”，对外界的一切引诱都充耳不闻，所谓“纵有千斛闷怀，百种春愁，难上我的眉头”，“任他春色年年，我的芳心依旧”；在逼婚的场合，她站在正直的立场反对父亲：“忒逾分，爹行所为，但索强，全不顾人议”；而当她和蔡伯喈成婚以后，却又变成温柔和顺夫唱妇随的贤妻；当她知道了蔡伯喈的心事，向父亲要求和丈夫同归乡里的时候，还指责了她父亲的不义：“爹居相位，怎说著伤风败俗、非理的言语，”甚至为了爹爹的不许还乡，还向蔡伯喈声言：
  “奴身拚舍，成伊孝名，救伊爹妈”；和赵五娘见面的时候，也毫无嫉妒之心，并且引咎自责：“情愿让他，居他下”，最后是抛弃了荣华富贵，随夫还乡，尽了她的“亲坟须共守”的孝道。
    这个人物从思想到生命，都是作者理想化的装璜和渲染，既缺乏现实基础，也没有生活的气息。可是，即使是在这样一个人物身上，由于作者在艺术形象创造上的现实主义力量，它在观众心目中形成的艺术感受，也还是和作者的主观意图有着分歧。和牛氏相对照，作者在“牛氏规奴”里，集中地创造了两个充满着生活气息的人物——姥姥和惜春，很显然，作者的主观意图，是想通过这两个人物的“庸俗”的生活理想和“轻浮”的行动，映照出牛氏的“贤德”和“高尚”，然而，事出作者意料之外，实际上唤起观众同情和喜爱的，却是姥姥和惜春。
      “老大”年纪的姥姥，“千不合万不合，前生不曾种得福田，爹娘把我送在府堂中做个丫头，到今年纪老了，不曾得一日眉头舒展”，将自己的青春和一生，都葬送在这人间牢狱的相府里。年轻的惜春，正在走当年姥姥的道路。小小的年纪就被关在这座“庭院重重”的牢狱里。连“春”也不许“伤”，“见男儿也不许”“抬头看一看”，甚至连园庭花柳也不能去欣赏。等老主人不在，偶而去花园玩耍，还受到了规责。通过这两个人物的生活和遭遇，我们看到了封建时代被压迫阶层的女奴，怎样在封建礼教的规范下，被夺去了青春和幸福。他们渴望的，只是“甚年能够和一丈夫，一处里双双雁儿舞”，却终生也不能得到。活泼的惜春和风趣横生的姥姥，才是真正的活生生的性格。他们有合理的人生理想，有追求美好生活的幻想和愿望。艺术形象所显示的，恰恰和作者的主观意图相反，这几个人物对照的描写，并没有达到颂扬封建礼教的目的，相反的，却十分动人地表现出了吃人礼教的本质，表现出了作者所颂扬的“松筠节操，蕙兰襟怀”的冷酷无情和违反人性。其艺术效果是，在观众的心目中，对姥姥和惜春，激发起同情和喜爱，而对于那个理想化的牛氏，却感到苍白和可怜。
    牛氏和牛相在形象上也有着对照的作用。作者对牛相采取的态度，是暴露的。牛相是“只为三不从，做成灾祸天来大”的祸根。“辞婚不可”，“辞官不可”，暴露出他的专横和无耻。女婿归省双亲不从，女儿从夫回乡不从，以至于女婿和女儿走了以后，又伪装成孝道的表扬者：“我如今去朝廷上表，奏蔡氏一门孝道，管取吾皇降丹诏，把他召”，暴露了他的自私和虚伪。作者是想通过牛氏和牛相的对照，烘托出牛氏的理想化的美德，然而，恰恰在这个艺术表现上，揭露了封建伦理说教的虚伪性。牛相是以三从四德、松筠节操来教育他的女儿的。事实表明，这些封建礼教的规范，对于他只有说教的意义，只能服从于他的利益，当现实违反了他的利益的时候，封建伦理规范，也完全可以弃之不顾。
    自然，特别表明了现实主义艺术表现能力削弱了作者主观的封建伦理说教作用的，是“琵琶记”全剧富有特征的艺术结构。作者不仅善于透过人物性格的对比，揭示生活的矛盾，而且善于运用强烈的鲜明对照的场面，展开舞台形象上的戏剧冲突。从第七出“才俊登程”一直到三十二出“路途劳顿”，占全剧大半篇幅的场面，戏剧的情节和冲突，都是在两种极端对立时相交替的场面上进行的。一个场面是蔡伯喈在京都的遭遇，一个场面是赵五娘在家乡的生活变化。作者的主观意图，或如青木正儿所说：“以牛府生活之安乐华丽，调节蔡家生活之凄惨，使观者不至酸鼻之极”，或者是为了表现两地相思，两地生活遭遇的痛苦和悲惨。然而，由于这种贫富悬殊鲜明生动的描写，却达到了控诉封建统治阶级豪华享受的罪恶，暴露了在这种豪华享受的背面被剥削的人民饥饿悲惨的生活。所谓“朱门酒肉臭，路有冻死骨”的两极生活，在古典戏剧中，没有再比“琵琶记”表现得真实而深刻的了。正是在这样的震撼人心的鲜明的艺术形象的对照里，更深地激起了观众对于赵五娘的同情和热爱，对于封建统治者的仇恨，对于蔡伯喈的轻蔑和憎恶。
    从琵琶记的艺术形象所显示出的这种错综复杂的矛盾现象来看，说高则诚在他的艺术创作中存在着世界观与现实主义创作的深刻的矛盾，是无可指摘的，这绝不是一个空洞的教条，而是“琵琶记”确实存在着需要具体分析的复杂内容。
                            三
    从主要的方面，说明“琵琶记”所显示的高则诚的世界观与现实主义创作存在的深刻矛盾，并不等于说，高则诚的世界观就完全是反动的，只是凭借表现生活的真实，才取得了
  “琵琶记”的成就。我们不可能设想，一个作家在认识现实生活的一切观点的总和上，都是反动的，却能创造出现实主义的作品。高则诚在“琵琶记”里为封建伦理思想进行的说教，是反动的，是封建主义的，是企图从赞颂封建伦理关系上来维护封建制度。但是，他对于现实生活认识的各个方面，并不都站在严格的封建主义立场。“琵琶记”的主题思想是复杂的，除去为封建伦理说教的一面，渗透着全剧还有着一个中心思想，那就是封建士大夫的出路问题。这个思想也是和整个悲剧的发展交织在一起的。所谓“三不从”，在形式上是
  “孝”的说教，在实质上，却是透过艺术形象的整体，表明醉心功名利禄的下场。在作者的心目里，蔡伯喈作为一个悲剧形象的意义，就是因为他没有坚持“功名非吾意儿”的理想，以致被“名缰利锁，牢络在海角天涯”，“做成灾祸天来大”。这种灰心仕途和统治者不合作的思想，是和作者的政治观点密切相关的。青木正儿恰当地评价了高则诚通过蔡伯喈所反映的思想倾向：“琵琶记实为避乱世之有为文人发满腔不平于词彩中之神品。”“瑞安县志”高则诚“本传”中所记载的他的身世经历，可以提供给我们探讨这种思想的线索。高则诚做过元朝的官，但为官清正，不仅在“贪残”的权贵面前，“委曲调护，民赖以安”，而且在“改调浙东阃幕四明都事”的时候，能做到“凡狱囚无验者悉讯遣之”，并且敢于“数忤权贵”。他的为人和为官的经历，恐怕就是形成他灰心仕途同统治者不合作的思想的原因。“明太祖闻其名召之，以老疾辞”的行动，更加说明这个人在一定程度上有反抗封建统治的因素。渗透在“琵琶记”中的思想，也正寄托着作者的政治观点和人生理想。如果他没有对封建社会许多不合理的事物，抱有反对的见解，没有对下层人民善良品质的认识和热爱，他就决不可能采取和坚持现实主义，尤其不可能塑造出赵五娘那样优美的妇女形象。
    有人说，赵五娘这个人物，在“琵琶记”里所以获得成功，是由于高则诚在她身上保留了民间传说的原型。又有人说，高则诚不写“琵琶记”便罢，要写“琵琶记”，就得把赵五娘写得真实，我想这些看法都是有些道理的。牛氏就是例证。高则诚本来是把牛氏作为理想人物塑造的，但是，由于它没有现实基础，缺乏真实的生命，所以在观众的心目中，它只是封建说教的概念化的影子。但是，作家和他的人物之间的关系是复杂的。尤其是像赵五娘这样的人物、她是
  “琵琶记”的灵魂。如果赵五娘的品质和她的生活遭遇，不是由高则诚对于现实生活深刻观察和认识的结晶，我们很难设想他能塑造出这样真实感人的形象。
    赵五娘作为一个优美的妇女典型，她的勤劳、善良、忠诚、宽厚和勇于承担一切困难的精神，以及她的悲惨的生活遭遇，是封建时代中国千百万妇女共同的性格和命运。高则诚虽然在这个人物身上也企图渲染上封建说教的色彩，可是，由于他的深刻的洞察能力，真实的生活感受，和对于这个人物的热爱，使它的现实性的品格概括得更深和更高，写出像“义仓赈济”、“勉食姑嫜”、“糟糠自厌”等被称为“神品”的场面来，这样，就大大地削弱了它的封建说教的作用。
    就全剧来看，伴随着整个剧情的发展，高则诚还在相当广阔的范围内暴露了封建社会不合理的现实。像对官场生活科举制度的暴露和嘲笑，像在“义仓赈济”中对于封建官吏残酷剥削人民贪污赈粮的辛辣描写，显然都表明着作者大胆的批判的见解和愤怒的感情，不能说它们就和作家的世界观毫无关系。
    所有这一切，都说明了高则诚不仅在世界观和现实主义创作上存在着深刻的矛盾，就是他的世界观的本身，也还存在着复杂矛盾的因素。正是由于他在现实生活的认识的一切观点的总和上，有反动的成分，也有进步的接近人民的成分，才使得他的艺术形象的创造，呈现出错综复杂的现象。我以为，具体地分析和研究这些现象，不仅对于辨明“琵琶记”的价值有很大的意义，就是对于研究和探讨文艺理论上的许多原则问题，也将有很大的推动作用。
