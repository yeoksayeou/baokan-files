    Shanghai Establishes Sanatorium for Barbers and Bathhouse Workers

    (Our Dispatch) The Shanghai Huangpu District Barber and Bathhouse Workers' Union Working Group of the Chinese Shop Employees' Union and the Shanghai Welfare Corporation Huangpu District Joint Venture Working Group recently established a sanatorium in Shanghai specifically for employees who have long-term illnesses that prevent them from working but cannot return to their hometowns and have no home in Shanghai to recuperate in.

    Currently, there are already ten barbers and bathhouse industry employees recuperating in this sanatorium.

    The equipment costs for this sanatorium totaled only a little over 50 yuan. Ten bamboo beds, mats, and some other daily necessities such as washbasins, hot water bottles, and spittoons were purchased. Everyone feels that the money was spent frugally, but it was done very well.

    In the past, barbers and bathhouse workers lived in the business premises. If they were sick, they could only endure it or rest in public places, and could only go back after closing time in the evening. Now that there is a sanatorium, employees have a place to recuperate. Everyone says that this is a benefit brought to employees by public-private partnerships. (You Gu)

    上海有了理发、沐浴职工休养所
    本报讯　中国店员工会上海市黄浦区理发沐浴工作组和上海市福利事业公司黄浦区合营工作组，最近在上海市设立了一个职工休养所，专门供给长期有病不能工作，但又不能回乡、在沪又没有家的职工去休养。
    现在，这个休养所里已经有十位理发和沐浴业的职工在休养了。
    这个休养所的设备费用一共只化了五十多元钱，买了十张竹床、席子和其他一些日用品如面盆、热水瓶、痰盂等，大家都觉得花钱少，但办得很好。
    过去理发沐浴业的职工都住在营业厅里，有病只能硬挺住或者到公共场所去休息，要到晚上打烊后才能回去。现在有了休养所，职工有了休养的地方，大家都说这是公私合营给职工带来的好处。（幽谷）
