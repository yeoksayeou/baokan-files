　　Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, July 8th: An unmanned cafeteria has appeared on the construction site of the Wuhan Iron and Steel United Enterprise. About half an hour before mealtime, the cooks neatly portioned and arranged the food, allowing the workers to freely choose and automatically pay with meal tickets. This allows workers to eat as soon as they arrive, and they can finish a meal in just a few minutes after entering the cafeteria.
　　In the past, eating in this cafeteria required long queues, and neither workers nor cooks had enough time for rest and recreation after meals. Since the implementation of the unmanned meal service, workers can fully rest for two hours after lunch. Carpenter Zhang Chongjian said, "Working under the scorching sun in the summer is very tiring. Being able to quickly eat and rest for two hours after work at noon gives me energy for work in the afternoon." At the same time, cooks can also free their hands to wash dishes and do other work while the workers are eating, and they also have time to rest and relax after meals.

    无人售饭食堂
    新华社武汉8日电　在武汉钢铁联合企业工地上，出现了一个无人售饭食堂。在开饭以前半小时左右，炊事员们就把饭菜井井有条地盛好摆开，由工人们随意挑选、自动付给饭票。这样随到随吃，工人们进食堂以后只要几分钟就能吃完一餐饭。
    往常，在这个食堂吃饭需要排队久等，工人和炊事员们饭后都没有充分的休息和娱乐时间。实行无人售饭的办法以后，工人们吃过午饭，可以足足休息两小时。木工张崇鉴说：“夏天在烈日下工作很疲倦，中午收工能迅速吃罢饭休息两个钟头，下午上班就有劲了。”同时，炊事员们也能在工人吃饭的时候腾出手来洗碗筷和干其他活，饭后也有时间休息和娱乐了。
