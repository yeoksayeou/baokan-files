    The Suez Canal Company

    The Suez Canal Company was established in 1858. It was formally known as an international private joint-stock company. The initial stock capital was 200 million francs, with 400,000 shares at 500 francs each. In 1924, the number of shares doubled to 800,000, and the price per share was correspondingly reduced to 250 francs. Initially, 52% of the shares were held by French capitalists. Egypt held 44%, and other relevant countries held only 4% of the shares. By 1875, the Egyptian shares were bought by the British government. Since then, the company has gradually been controlled by the British.

    In two decrees issued by Egypt in 1854 and 1856, the main rights and obligations of the Suez Canal Company were defined. These two decrees were approved by the Turkish Sultan in March 1866. The main contents of the decrees are as follows:

    1. The joint-stock company has a 99-year lease on the Suez Canal, from the date of the canal's opening to navigation until November 17, 1968.
    2. After the expiration of the lease, the Suez Canal will be wholly owned by Egypt.
    3. The distribution of the company's profits shall be in the following proportions: Egypt gets 15%, the company's investors and founders get 10%, administrative personnel get 2%, a special fund accounts for 2% (pensions, subsidies, and bonuses for company employees, etc.), and the shareholders get 71%.
    4. The Suez Canal Company is managed by a board of directors consisting of 32 directors. The directors are appointed by people from the main relevant countries.

    In addition to the above two decrees, more than seventy various agreements were signed later. These agreements superficially "stipulated" the relationship between the company and the Egyptian government, but in reality, they forced the Egyptian government to recognize many of the company's privileges.

    According to the company's articles of association, all major issues, including the distribution of profits, should be decided at the shareholders' meeting. The management of the canal is decided by the board of directors (both meetings are held in Paris). The board of directors has a total of 32 directors. Since 1950, the board of directors has consisted of sixteen French, nine British, five Egyptians, one Dutch, and one American. However, before 1936, there were no Egyptians on the board of directors at all. After the signing of the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty in 1936, two of the French directors' seats were allocated to Egypt, and after the agreement in March 1949, the number of Egyptian directors was expanded to five.

    The profit margin of the Suez Canal Company is enormous. In the sixty years from 1870 to 1930, the company's net profit reached 3.5 billion gold francs, which is about nine times the cost of digging the canal. After the Second World War, the company's profits increased significantly. In 1950, the company's income reached 28 billion francs, which is almost 18 times more than before the war. Among them, the net profit was about 17 billion francs.

    Despite the company's large profits, Egypt received very little. A large part of the 15% of the profits that Egypt should have received according to regulations was transferred to the French company - Egypt's creditor. From 1937 to 1949, the Egyptian government received only a pitiful amount - 300,000 Egyptian pounds per year and income tax on the company's profits.

    苏彝士运河公司
    苏彝士运河公司是1858年成立的。它在形式上被称为是一个国际私人股份公司。最初股票资本共二亿法郎，股票四十万张，每张五百法郎。1924年股票数目增加一倍，即达到八十万张，每张股票的价格也相应地降低到二百五十法郎。最初股票的52％都握在法国一些资本家的手里。埃及握有44％，其他有关国家只握有股票的4％。到1875年，埃及股票被英国政府买走。从此，公司即逐渐被英国人控制。
    埃及在1854年和1856年颁发的两个法令中，曾确定了苏彝士运河公司的主要权利和义务。这两个法令是在1866年3月经土耳其苏丹批准的。法令的主要内容如下：
    一、股份公司拥有对苏彝士运河的租借权九十九年，即从运河通航日到1968年11月17日止。
    二、租借期满后，苏彝士运河完全归埃及所有。
    三、公司的利润分配应按照下列比例进行：埃及得15％，公司的投资开办人得10％，行政管理人员得2％，专门基金占2％（公司职工的抚恤金、补助费和奖金等），各股东得71％。
    四、苏彝士运河公司由三十二位董事组成的董事会来管理。董事由主要有关国家人士担任。
    除去上述两个法令外，后来还陆续签订了七十多个各种协定。这些协定表面上是“规定”公司和埃及政府之间的关系，实际上是强使埃及政府承认该公司的许多项特权。
    根据公司章程，一切主要问题，包括利润的分配，都应在股东大会上来决定。运河的管理问题则由董事会决定（这两个会都设在巴黎）。董事会共有三十二名董事。自1950年后，董事会中法国人占十六名，英国人九名，埃及人五名，荷兰人和美国人各一名。但是，在1936年以前，董事会中根本没有埃及人。1936年英埃条约签订后，法国董事的位子才拨出二名给埃及，到1949年3月的协定后，埃及董事才扩大到五人。
    苏彝士运河公司的利润额是非常巨大的。从1870年到1930年的六十年间，公司的纯利就达三十五亿金法郎，约等于运河开凿费的九倍。第二次世界大战后，公司利润显著增加。1950年公司收入已达到二百八十亿法郎，几乎较战前增加了十八倍。其中纯利约一百七十亿法郎。
    尽管公司利润很大，但是埃及得到的却很少。埃及根据规定所应得的利润的15％，很大一部分却转到法国公司——埃及债主的手中去了。从1937年到1949年，埃及政府每年所得只有少得可怜的数目——三十万埃镑和公司利润的所得税。
