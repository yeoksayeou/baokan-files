Xinhua News Agency, Zhenyuan, July 24th: The social landscape of the Southeast Guizhou region has undergone fundamental changes, and the Miao, Dong, and other ethnic groups have entered a new era of socialist construction characterized by ethnic equality, friendship, and mutual assistance. This was stated by Zhang Yuhuan, Secretary of the CPC Southeast Guizhou Local Committee, in his report on the work situation in the Southeast Guizhou region over the past six years and his opinions on the work for 1956, delivered at the first session of the First People's Congress of the Southeast Guizhou Miao and Dong Autonomous Prefecture on the 16th.

In his report, Zhang Yuhuan said that under the encouragement of the Party Central Committee's "Resolution on the Question of Agricultural Cooperation" and Chairman Mao's "On the Question of Agricultural Cooperation," and under the principle of taking into account ethnic characteristics, the people of all ethnic groups in the Southeast Guizhou region have basically realized elementary agricultural cooperation together with the Han areas. The unity of all ethnic groups has been further consolidated on the basis of consistent economic interests.

Thanks to the strong economic and technical support of the People's Government, production in the Southeast Guizhou region has developed rapidly. In 1955, the total grain output increased by 39% compared to 1950, and cash crops such as flue-cured tobacco, cotton, rapeseed, and peanuts increased by 20% to 200% respectively. Forestry and animal husbandry have also developed greatly; this spring alone, more than 270,000 mu of afforestation and 1,968 mu of seedling cultivation were carried out.

In terms of local industry, more than 40 small factories and mines have been built successively for power generation, winemaking, wood processing, agricultural tool repair, coal, and iron.

With the development of production, state-owned commerce has greatly developed. State-owned and cooperative commerce have supplied a large number of production and daily necessities suitable for the needs of all ethnic groups over the past few years. The total purchase amount in 1955 increased fourteen times compared to 1950, and the total sales amount increased seventy-five times.

The material and cultural life of all ethnic groups has been significantly improved and enhanced. In 1955, the average purchasing power of the people in the region increased by more than double compared to 1950. In this region, there are now more than 120,000 primary school students and more than 4,300 secondary school students, of whom children of workers and peasants account for 84% of the total. Mobile film projection teams and radio stations have been established in vast urban and rural areas. Medical and health workers here have treated and controlled the infectious diseases that posed the greatest threat to people's health in the past, and have trained 2,970 midwives, improving delivery methods and greatly reducing the mortality rate of mothers and infants.

Zhang Yuhuan said that in the past six years, the Southeast Guizhou region has actively promoted the policy of ethnic regional autonomy, successively established ethnic democratic joint governments at the prefectural or county level, established Miao autonomous counties such as Danzhai, Lushan, Taijiang, and Leishan, and cultivated a large number of ethnic minority cadres. At present, cadres from various ethnic groups account for more than 41% of the cadres at the township level and above, and local Han cadres account for 45%, basically realizing ethnic representation and localization.

When talking about the work tasks of the Southeast Guizhou region in 1956, Zhang Yuhuan said that it is necessary to strengthen the consolidation and improvement of agricultural production cooperatives, earnestly implement the policy of running cooperatives diligently and thriftily, and strive to complete and overfulfill the region's increased production plans for grain, flue-cured tobacco, rapeseed, ramie, and tea this year, so that more than 90% of the members increase their income. Efforts should be made to run the existing batch of advanced cooperatives well, laying a solid foundation for realizing advanced cooperation this winter and next spring. Local industry and handicrafts are required to meet the growing needs of urban and rural people. The postal, telecommunications, transportation, and state-owned commerce sectors should be further developed. In order to cultivate a large number of talents to meet the needs of national construction, it is planned to build one ethnic normal school and one agricultural school this year, as well as eleven primary schools, and actively develop cultural broadcasting and health undertakings. It is planned to achieve that every county has a film projection team, every township has a midwifery station, and every cooperative has a health worker this year.

    黔东南地区的六年
    新华社镇远24日电　黔东南地区的社会面貌根本改变了，苗族、侗族及其他各族人民进入了民族平等、友爱互助的社会主义建设新时代。这是中共黔东南地方委员会书记张玉环十六日在黔东南苗族侗族自治州第一届人民代表大会第一次会议上作的关于黔东南地区六年来的工作情况和1956年工作意见的报告时说的。
    张玉环在报告中说：黔东南地区各族人民在党中央“关于农业合作化问题的决议”和毛主席“关于农业合作化问题”的鼓舞下，在照顾民族特点的原则下，已经和汉族地区一道，基本上实现了初级农业合作化。各族人民的团结，在经济利益一致的基础上更加巩固了。
    由于人民政府在经济上和技术上的大力支援，黔东南地区的生产获得迅速发展。1955年比1950年粮食总产量增加了39％，烤烟、棉花、油菜、花生等经济作物都分别增长两成到两倍。林业和畜牧业也都有了很大发展，仅今年春天就造林二十七万多亩，育苗一千九百六十八亩。
    在地方工业方面，先后兴建了发电、酿酒、木材加工、农具修配、煤铁等小型厂矿四十多个。
    随着生产的发展，国营商业有了很大发展。国营、合作社商业几年来供应了大批适合各族人民需要的生产和生活用品。1955年比1950年收购总额增加了十四倍，销售总额增加了七十五倍。
    各族人民的物质文化生活，有了显著的改善和提高。1955年全区人民的购买力平均比1950年增长一倍多。在这个地区，现在有十二万多小学生和四千三百多个中等学校学生，其中工农子女占总数84％。巡回电影队、广播收音站已在广大城镇和农村建立起来。这里的医务卫生工作人员对过去危害人民健康最大的传染病作了治疗和控制，并且训练二千九百七十名接生员，改进了接生方法使产妇和婴儿的死亡率大大降低。
    张玉环说，六年来黔东南地区积极推行了民族区域自治政策，先后建立了专区或县的民族民主联合政府，丹寨、炉山、台江、雷山等苗族自治县，培养了大批的民族干部，目前各兄弟民族干部占乡级以上干部数的41％多，地方汉族干部占45％，已基本上实现了民族化和地方化。
    张玉环谈到1956年黔东南地区的工作任务时说，必须加强农业生产合作社的巩固提高工作，认真贯彻执行勤俭办社方针，争取完成和超额完成全区今年粮食、烤烟、油菜、苎麻、茶叶等增产计划，使90％以上的社员增加收入。努力办好现有的一批高级社，为今冬明春实现高级合作化打下巩固基础。要求地方工业和手工业满足城乡人民日益增长的需要。邮电、交通运输业和国营商业要有进一步的发展。为了大量培养人材，适应国家建设的需要，计划今年新建民族师范、农业学校各一所，小学十一所，并积极发展文化广播和卫生事业，计划今年达到县县有电影队，乡乡有接生站，社社有保健员。
