Xinhua News Agency Report:

    Many new crops and fruit trees trial-planted at the Lhasa Agricultural Experiment Station have proven that they can be promoted for planting on the Tibetan Plateau.
    Over 700 mu of Wugong No. 17 and Nanda 2419 spring wheat, which were massively propagated this year, are currently in the grain-filling stage. It is estimated that they will mature more than ten days earlier than the local spring wheat. After several years of trials, the yield can reach about 800 jin per mu, and they have the advantages of being cold-resistant, disease-resistant, and lodging-resistant. These varieties will be promoted in Tibet next year.
    The rape and newly introduced soybeans trial-planted at the experiment station are full of pods. Several types of hemp have grown to two meters tall. The person in charge of the farm said that judging from the growth of these rape and hemp crops, they all have promotional value.
    The more than 300 mu of vegetables planted by the experiment station this year began supplying construction units and transportation departments in Lhasa two months ago. Watermelons that have been hybridized and grafted have grown to more than ten jin each; after solving the cultivation technology, they can be promoted for planting in the Lhasa area.
    In the farm's orchard area, more than 800 apple, pear, grape, and peach trees donated by the central delegation and introduced by the experiment station have all sprouted branches and leaves. Among these fruit trees, one was planted personally by Vice Premier of the State Council Chen Yi.
    The planting area of the experiment station has been expanded to 1,800 mu this year. During the spring sowing period, the staff of the experiment station helped farmers in several nearby villages plant the experimentally successful spring wheat, teaching them to use new farm tools and field management. Currently, the staff is also teaching farmers how to use medicines to promote the early maturity of tomatoes and other methods.
    Xinhua News Agency Xigaze, July 27th: More than 340 varieties of crops and vegetables newly introduced to the Xigaze Agricultural Experiment Station this year are generally growing well.
    More than 20 varieties of wheat, such as Bima No. 1 and Nanda No. 2419, have entered the grain-filling stage. These varieties have shown strong disease resistance and lodging resistance on the plateau.
    Four varieties of potatoes, such as Baron, introduced from the Northeast, mature earlier than the local potato varieties, and the tubers are also larger. Agricultural workers believe that the Xigaze area is a good area for planting these new potato varieties.
    The rape, sunflower, flax, and other crops introduced this year are growing very well. The apple, peach, plum and other fruit trees planted on a larger area this year have also sprouted and grown.

    新引进的许多农作物
    在拉萨日喀则生长良好
    据新华社讯　拉萨农业试验场试种的许多新作物和果树，证明能够在西藏高原上推广种植。
    今年大面积繁殖的七百多亩武功十七号和南大二四一九等春小麦，正在灌浆，估计比当地的春小麦要早熟十多天。经过几年来的试验，每亩可产八百斤左右，并具有耐寒、抗病、不倒伏等优点。这些品种明年将在西藏推广。
    试验场试种的油菜和新引进的大豆都结满荚子。几种麻都已长到两公尺高。农场负责人说，从这些油菜和麻类生长情况来看，都有推广价值。
    今年试验场种植的三百多亩蔬菜，两个月前就开始供应拉萨施工单位和运输部门。经过杂交和嫁接的西瓜已长到十多斤重；在栽培技术上求得解决后，就可在拉萨地区推广种植。
    在农场的果树区里，中央代表团赠送的和试验场引进的八百多株苹果、梨、葡萄、桃子等，都抽出枝叶。这些果树中，有一株是国务院副总理陈毅亲手栽上的。
    试验场的种植面积，今年已扩大为一千八百亩。在春播期间，试验场的工作人员帮助附近几个村子的农民种植了经试验成功的春小麦，教给他们使用新式农具和田间管理。目前工作人员还正教给农民用药剂促进西红柿早熟等方法。
    新华社日喀则27日电　日喀则农业试验场今年新引进的三百四十多个品种的作物和菜蔬，普遍生长良好。
    碧蚂一号和南大二四一九号等二十多个品种的小麦，都已进入灌浆期，这些品种在高原上显示出了抗病力强和不易倒伏等优点。
    从东北引进的男爵等四个品种的马铃薯，比当地品种的马铃薯成熟早，薯块也大。农业工作者认为日喀则地区是种植这些新品种马铃薯的好地区。
    今年引进的油菜、向日葵、亚麻等都长得很好。今年较大面积种植的苹果、桃和李等果树，也都已抽条发芽。
