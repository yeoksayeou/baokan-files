Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 16th: Shenyang City has begun adjusting worker housing. The first batch of thirty-four worker households have recently moved into residences closer to their factories. They are all very satisfied after moving. Cao Xingxu, a worker at the Shenyang Clothing Factory, originally lived in the Tiexi District and worked in the city center. On sunny days, it took him more than an hour to cycle from home to the factory. Zhou Xingran, who works at the Shenyang Light Bulb Factory in the Tiexi District, lived not far from where Cao Xingxu worked. This time, they swapped houses, and it only takes them about twenty minutes to get to work.

Every morning and evening, on the streets of Shenyang, thousands of workers ride bicycles, trolleybuses, trams, and buses, flowing back and forth long distances in eastern and western, and northwestern directions. These long-distance commutes take a lot of time, preventing these workers from getting adequate rest and study.

In light of this situation, the Shenyang Municipal Real Estate Administration Bureau and relevant departments conducted in-depth investigations of worker housing, learned that more than a thousand worker households requested housing adjustments, and organized them to exchange houses voluntarily.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Changsha: Hengyang City, Hunan Province, which is short of housing, plans to use the "self-construction with public assistance" method to help workers and residents build 1,200 new houses in the second half of this year. Currently, 335 worker households have applied to build.

The city's Housing Construction Committee recently dispatched a large number of cadres to conduct investigations in more than 80 factories and enterprises throughout the city in order to make a citywide housing construction plan and strive to basically solve the problem of the lack of worker housing in the city this year.

    沈阳组织职工互换住宅
    衡阳采用自建公助办法建筑职工住房
    新华社沈阳16日电　沈阳市开始调整职工住宅，第一批三十四户职工，最近已经搬进了离工厂较近的住宅。他们搬家以后，都很满意。沈阳市被服厂工人曹兴旭，原来家住铁西区，工作地点在城里。天晴的时候，从家到工厂骑自行车需要一个多钟头。在铁西区沈阳灯泡厂工作的周醒然，家住的地方和曹兴旭工作的地点距离不远。这次他们两人对换了房屋，大家上班都只需要二十来分钟。
    每天早晨和傍晚，在沈阳市街头上，有成千职工骑着自行车、乘着无轨电车、有轨电车、公共汽车，往东西方向、西北方向长距离互相对流。这样距离很远的往返，花费很多时间，使这些职工不能很好的休息和学习。
    根据这种情况，沈阳市房地产管理局和有关部门，深入到职工住宅进行调查，了解了有一千多户职工要求调整住宅，就组织他们在自愿的原则之下互相调换。
    据新华社长沙讯　住房不足的湖南省衡阳市，准备今年下半年采用“自建公助”办法帮助职工和居民建筑一千二百间新住宅。目前已经有三百三十五户职工申请认建。
    这个市的住宅兴建委员会最近派出大批干部，分别到全市八十多个工厂企业单位进行调查，以便作出全市住宅兴建规划，争取在今年内基本上解决全市职工住宅缺乏的问题。
