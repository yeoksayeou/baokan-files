    Xinjiang Petroleum Administration Completes Drilling and Geological Survey Plan for the First Half of the Year

    (Our newspaper, Urumqi, 4th dispatch) The Xinjiang Petroleum Administration, on June 25th, exceeded the state drilling plan for the first half of the year five days ahead of schedule. On June 26th, it also exceeded the state oil production plan for June. By the end of June, the geological survey plan for the first half of the year had also been exceeded.

    Since April, the Xinjiang Petroleum Administration has promoted 58 advanced experiences created by its employees, and new production records have been continuously emerging. The discovery of the Karamay oil field is even more inspiring. After Ren Yutang, a drilling technician, led his drilling team in proposing "fast drilling" in Karamay, a "fast drilling week" was launched in the Karamay oil area. The drilling team led by Qi Maosheng used a Bayi-40 drilling rig, and the workers drilled 310 meters in one day and night, setting the highest drilling record for similar drilling rigs in the country. The drilling team led by Li Shishun completed an exploratory well in just thirteen days.

    Geological survey teams are also constantly setting new records. The Zhuang Guocheng seismic team, which surveyed Karamay last year, set a national record of measuring 20 stations per day on May 20th this year. The Ba Yuli surveying team overcame sand hills, snow, and severe cold, and completed 454 kilometers of guide wire measurement in 40 days, averaging 11.35 kilometers per day, breaking the quota of 6 kilometers per day.

    新疆石油管理局完成上半年钻井和地质调查计划
    本报乌鲁木齐4日电　新疆石油管理局，在六月二十五日提前五天超额完成上半年的国家钻井计划，二十六日又超额完成六月份的国家采油计划。到六月底，上半年的地质调查计划也超额完成了。
    四月份以来，新疆石油管理局推广了职工们创造的五十八项先进经验，生产上的新纪录不断出现。克拉玛依油田的发现，更振奋人心。钻井技师任玉堂率领的钻井队，在克拉玛依提出“快速钻进”的倡议后，“快速钻进周”就在克拉玛依油区展开了。戚茂生率领的钻井队使用的是贝乌—四十型钻机，工人们一昼夜钻进三百一十公尺，创造了全国同类型钻机钻进的最高纪录。李世顺率领的钻井队，仅仅十三天便钻完了一口探井。
    地质调查队也不断创造新纪录。去年在克拉玛依勘测过的庄国成地震队，在今年五月二十日创造了日测二十站的全国最高纪录。导线测量队的白玉礼小组，战胜了沙山、积雪和严寒，在四十天内完成了454公里的导线测量任务，平均日测十一点三五公里，突破了日测六公里的定额。
