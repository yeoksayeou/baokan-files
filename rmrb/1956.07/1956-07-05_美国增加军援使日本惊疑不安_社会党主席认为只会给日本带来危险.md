Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 4th dispatch: Japanese Socialist Party Chairman, Suzuki Mosaburo, stated today that the United States’ large increase in military “aid” funds “will bring great danger to Japan's future."

According to testimony from the US House Appropriations Committee on the new foreign aid bill released on the 2nd, the United States plans to provide approximately 13.5 times more military "aid" to Japan in the 1957 fiscal year than in 1956. Based on Japan's actual receipt of US military "aid" in 1956, which amounted to $11.1 million, the total amount of new US military "aid" to Japan will reach $148.85 million. This military "aid" will include jet aircraft, warships, tanks, and "advanced weapons."

According to the Associated Press, quoting the testimony of senior US government officials, the US suddenly wants to substantially increase military "aid" to Japan because, among all Far Eastern countries receiving US military "aid," only Japan can "fully afford to undertake the task of primary defense responsibility in the Far East." US Assistant Secretary of State Robertson, in testifying for this plan, told the Appropriations Committee, "The money we spend on Japanese troops is not spent solely for Japan. If the defense of this region were not related to our interests... we certainly would not recommend spending millions of dollars in Japan."

Suzuki Mosaburo pointed out that the testimony of US officials clearly demonstrates that the US wants to force Japan to accept US defense plans and strategies. He said that if this US plan is realized, Japan's army, navy, and air force will increase rapidly. "The United States will demand that Japan spend more on military expenses. This will undermine Japan's finances and economy, cause military inflation, and plunge the national livelihood into instability." He said, "We firmly oppose this US conspiracy to turn Japan into an outpost base and use Japanese people to defend the United States."

The news says that this new US plan for large-scale rearmament of Japan has caused surprise and suspicion among officials of the Japanese Defense Agency and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. According to Kyodo News, Defense Agency officials believe that the US plan indicates that "the United States, through indirect means of increasing aid, is expressing dissatisfaction with Japan's long-term (military expansion) plan and is demanding that Japan further strengthen its rearmament in both quality and quantity."

### 美国增加军援使日本惊疑不安  社会党主席认为只会给日本带来危险

    美国增加军援使日本惊疑不安
    社会党主席认为只会给日本带来危险
    新华社4日讯　东京消息：日本社会党主席铃木茂三郎今天发表谈话说，美国大量增加对日本的军事“援助”费“将给日本的将来带来很大的危险”。
    根据美国众议院拨款委员会在二日发表的新的援外法案的证词，美国在1957财政年度计划给予日本的军事“援助”约等于1956年度的十三点五倍。按照1956年度日本实际接受美国军事“援助”为一千一百万美元计算，美国对日本的新的军事“援助”的总额将达一亿四千八百五十万美元。在这些军事“援助”中将包括喷气式飞机、战舰、坦克和“先进武器”。
    据合众社引用美国政府高级官员的证词说，美国突然要对日本大量增加军事“援助”，是因为在所有得到美国军事“援助”的远东国家中只有日本能够“充分负担得起在远东承担主要防御责任的任务”。美国助理国务卿罗伯逊在为这个计划作证时向拨款委员会说，“我们将花在日本部队身上的钱并不是仅仅为日本而花的。如果这个地区的防御不关系到我们的利益的话……我们当然不会向你们建议在日本花成百万的美元。
    铃木茂三郎指出，美国官员的证词清楚地表明，美国要强迫日本接受美国的国防计划和战略。他说，如果美国的这个计划实现的话，日本的陆、海、空军就要迅速增加。“美国将会要求日本支出更多的军费。这将破坏日本的财政和经济，引起军事通货膨胀，并且使国民生活陷入不稳定状态中。”他说：“我们坚决反对美国这种把日本变成前哨基地和用日本人来保卫美国的阴谋”。
    消息说，美国的这个大规模重新武装日本的新计划引起了日本防卫厅和外务省官员的惊讶和怀疑。据共同社报道，防卫厅人士认为，美国的这个计划表明“美国以增加援助的间接方式对日本的长期（扩军）计划表示不满，要求日本在质和量两方面进一步加强重整军备”。
