    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, July 29th: According to TASS, the Japanese delegation, led by Japanese Foreign Minister Mamoru Shigemitsu, arrived in Moscow by plane from Stockholm on the evening of July 28th to conduct negotiations on the normalization of Soviet-Japanese relations.
    Negotiations were temporarily suspended this spring at the request of the Japanese side. According to the agreement already reached, negotiations should resume no later than July 31st.
    The head of the Japanese delegation, Mamoru Shigemitsu, made a statement at the airport. He said: I have come here as a representative of the Japanese people and government. The purpose of our meeting is to quickly end the abnormal state of war that has continued for more than ten years since the end of the war, and to seek a path to the normalization of Soviet-Japanese relations. Establishing solid peaceful relations between Japan and the Soviet Union should be the responsibility of the national leaders of both countries. At the same time, I believe that this issue should be resolved to the satisfaction of both parties, so that it will no longer become a source of trouble in future relations between the two countries. It is for this purpose that I intend to exchange opinions frankly with the responsible representatives of the Soviet government and achieve good results.
    Greeting the Japanese delegation at Vnukovo Airport were Soviet Foreign Minister Shepilov and other government officials, diplomatic envoys from various countries stationed in Moscow, and Soviet and foreign journalists.

    新华社29日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科二十九日讯：由日本外务相重光葵率领的日本代表团在七月二十八日晚上从斯德哥尔摩乘飞机到达莫斯科，前来进行关于苏日关系正常化的谈判。
    谈判曾于今年春天应日本方面的要求暂时中断，根据已经达成的协议，谈判应当不迟于七月三十一日恢复。
    日本代表团团长重光葵在机场上发表谈话。他说：我作为日本人民和政府的代表来到这里。我们这次会谈的目的是要迅速终止战争结束十多年以来继续存在的不正常的战争状态，并且寻求苏日关系正常化的道路。建立日苏两国之间的巩固和平关系应当是两国国家领导人的责任。同时，我认为，这个问题应当得到彼此感到满意的解决，从而不再成为两国今后关系中的祸根。正是为了这个目的，我打算同苏联政府的负责代表开诚布公地交换意见，取得良好的结果。
