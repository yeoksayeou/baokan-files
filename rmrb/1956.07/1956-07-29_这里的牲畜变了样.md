    The Livestock Here Have Changed
    By Our Correspondent Lin Mo
    Have you ever seen a fine wool sheep? Its wool is about two or three inches long, thick all over, so dense you can't grab through it. The wool is fine and soft, and when sheared, it comes off in clumps like cotton fluff. In the factory, it can be spun into 64-count fine yarn. An ordinary purebred fine wool sheep produces about 15-20 jin of wool per year, and the best can produce up to 50 jin. That's enough raw material for several suits of clothes. But currently, our sheep produce wool that is both coarse and sparse. One sheep can only produce three or four jin of wool per year. This wool can only be used for making felt, carpets, and some coarse woolen fabrics. If factories want to weave fine wool fabrics, they still have to import fine wool from abroad.
    Then there are cows. A good breed of dairy cow can produce 30-40 jin of milk per day. But now, the dairy cows in our pastoral areas can only produce four or five jin of milk a day. If these cows were all improved to superior breeds, not only could the milk supply in big cities like Beijing and Shanghai be fully guaranteed, but even many members of collective farms could eat milk and butter.
    So, is it possible to improve the breeds of cattle and sheep on a large scale? The situation of livestock improvement in Ongniud Banner in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region can answer this question with certainty. Currently, one-third of the sheep in Ongniud Banner are improved breeds. There are also several hundred improved cattle.
    In the Red Star Pastoral Production Cooperative in the Seventh District, I saw dozens of improved calves born this year. Their coats were exceptionally shiny, and they were taller and bigger than the local cattle from birth. Each one was happily frolicking, which was really delightful. Comrade Sa Renqimuge, the female member in charge of managing the calf herd, told me that the fiery red ones are Shorthorn cattle, the black and white spotted ones are Dutch cattle, and there are also Korean cattle, which are especially strong for plowing.
    "Look, that one is a second-generation improved calf that was just born." Sa Renqimuge pointed to a fiery red calf that was being nursed, "Its mother was the first-generation hybrid born in 1953 (crossbred between Shorthorn cattle and local cattle). Now the calf born is even better. It's truly one generation surpassing the previous!"
    After I saw the calves, I went to see the lambs. Improved sheep accounted for 70% of the sheep in the Red Star Cooperative. When I went in May, more than a hundred improved lambs had just been born, filling a pen. Each one was covered in fluffy, curly, fine wool. It is said that each lamb can be shorn of four or five jin of wool in the autumn, which is twice as much as the wool produced by local sheep, and it can be sold for several times the price.
    The livestock improvement work in Ongniud Banner began in 1952. That year, the former Rehe Provincial Department of Agriculture (Ongniud Banner originally belonged to Rehe Province; after Rehe Province was abolished in 1955, it was assigned to Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region) successively sent twenty Northeast improved sheep (descendants of several fine wool sheep, such as Bluefaced Leicester, Caucasian Merino, and Stavropol sheep, crossed with local sheep), six Shorthorn breeding bulls, two Dutch breeding bulls, and several Korean breeding bulls, and sent four livestock technicians. The Northeast Academy of Agricultural Sciences also sent specialists to provide guidance.
    A new task is always bound to encounter many difficulties at the beginning. At that time, the breeding technology was not skilled enough, the masses were not used to it, and there was a lack of experience in everything. In order to let the masses understand the benefits of improved breeds, Director Ma of the Rehe Provincial Department of Agriculture personally went to the pastoral areas with pictures of improved livestock to publicize them to the masses.
    The herders had never heard of using artificial insemination to breed livestock, and they were surprised when they saw it: "Hey, what are you doing! If injections (referring to injecting semen) can produce lambs, what do we need rams for!" Some old people would either purse their lips or turn their faces away when they encountered artificial insemination being performed on livestock. No one went to the breeding station's house. Bad elements also took the opportunity to spread rumors and sabotage.
    The following spring, the first generation of hybrid lambs was born. The herders didn't like them either, saying that they were "bare-bottomed" (newborn hybrid lambs have sparse and short wool), had no tails, and had mixed colors. From head to toe, they couldn't find a single thing to like. "Look at this reddish thing, it's neither a cat nor a dog, what is it?" Everyone who saw it had to comment on it.
    But in less than half a month, the little lambs grew a dense coat of curly wool and became larger. In the autumn, when the wool was sheared, a one-year-old lamb produced more wool than a local adult sheep; when taken to the supply and marketing cooperative to sell, one jin could fetch the price of two jin. This was when the herders' views began to change:
    "Oh, improved lambs are good! We should breed more of them!"
    Comrade Hasidalai, the head of the Agriculture and Animal Husbandry Section of the Ongniud Banner People's Committee, who is responsible for leading the entire banner's livestock improvement work, repeatedly emphasized to me that the quality of temporary herd management during the breeding period is an important factor in determining the effectiveness of breeding. Because in the autumn, before the ewes are close to the estrus period, the herders of each village drive the sheep to be bred to the breeding station. Each breeding station has to concentrate 500 to 800 sheep for temporary grazing for one and a half months. If you are not careful, it will cause confusion and losses.
    "We didn't pay attention to this matter in the first year, and the facts taught us a harsh lesson!" Hasidalai recalled the situation at the time and said: "At that time, the pasture was not well chosen, and the temporarily hired herders were not very responsible, causing the ewes to lose weight, which affected estrus and conception. When the sheep were concentrated, we did not strictly check for diseases, and various diseases were transmitted to each other. After breeding, when the herders drove the ewes back, there were also confusion and incidents of wrong taking and loss.
    "Later, we paid close attention to this work every year. We select pastures in advance in the summer; hire excellent herders; ensure good pastures, good grazing, no diseases, and increased fatness. The conception rate of sheep is above 90%."
    The party and government leaders of the banner regard the improvement of livestock breeds as an important task in the development of animal husbandry production, and often help them sum up experience and mobilize all parties to support it. The livestock improvement work has been developed and expanded year by year. In 1952, there were only three breeding stations, breeding 1,900 ewes. By 1955, it had developed to sixteen breeding stations, breeding 6,500 ewes and 321 cows. This year, it is planned to set up eighteen stations, and the number of ewes to be bred will be doubled compared to last year, and the number of cows to be bred will be increased fivefold.
    What is particularly important is that in the past few years of work, a group of ethnic Mongolian herder technicians has been trained, so that the breeding work has taken root among the masses. Each breeding station absorbs several herder activists every year - most of them are village animal care committee members - and teaches them technology by apprenticeship. Now 30 herders have become staff members of the breeding station; there are also about 20 herders who have mastered the technology of artificial insemination. This year, they plan to hand over four breeding stations to the herders completely, and the banner will only send a technician to provide guidance. Now more than 90% of the herders in the banner have joined pastoral production cooperatives. This has created even more favorable conditions for livestock improvement work.
    Ongniud Banner has formulated a long-term plan for improving livestock breeds: by 1962, the improvement of all the banner's sheep will be completed. By then, the banner will have 250,000 improved sheep. The cattle improvement work will be completed by 1967. At that time, the banner will have 255,000 head of improved cattle. Based on past experience and existing work foundations, they are fully confident of completing this plan.

    这里的牲畜变了样
    本报记者　林沫
    你见过良种细毛羊吗？它身上的毛，约有两三寸长，满身厚厚的，一把抓不透。毛又细又软，剪下来一团团像棉花绒一样。拿到工厂里，可以纺成六十四支的细毛纱。一头普通的纯种细毛羊，每年约产十五——二十斤羊毛，最好的可达到五十斤。足够几套衣服的原料。可是眼下咱们的羊，产的毛既粗又少。一只羊一年只能产三、四斤毛。这些毛，只能杆毡子，制毯子和织一些粗呢子。工厂要织细呢子，还得从外国进口细羊毛。
    再说牛，一头好的良种乳牛，每天能产三、四十斤奶。可是现在咱们牧区的乳牛，一天只能挤四、五斤奶。如果把这些牛都改良成优良品种，不要说北京、上海等大城市的牛奶可以充分供应，连许多集体农庄的庄员们，也能吃上牛奶和黄油了。
    那么，大规模地改良牛、羊的品种能办得到吗？内蒙古自治区翁牛特旗牲畜改良的情形，可以肯定的回答。现在翁牛特旗的绵羊有三分之一是改良羊。改良牛也有几百头。
    在七区红星牧业生产合作社，我看到几十头今年刚生下的改良牛犊，毛色分外光亮，生下来就比本地牛高大，一个个欢蹦活跳的，实在逗人喜爱。负责管理牛犊群的女社员萨仁其母格向我说，那火红色的是短角牛、黑花儿的是荷兰牛，还有耕地特别有力气的朝鲜牛。
    “看，那一头是刚生下的第二代改良牛犊。”萨仁其母格指着一头正在吃奶的火红色的牛犊说，“它的母亲是1953年生下来的第一代杂种（短角牛和本地牛交配），如今生下的犊儿更好了，真是一代胜过一代！”
    我看了牛犊，又去看羊羔。红星社的绵羊，改良羊占70％。五月间我去时，刚生下一百多只改良羊羔，挤满了一圈，个个满身长着茸茸的卷曲的细毛儿。据说，每只羊羔到秋天就能剪下四、五斤毛，比本地羊出的毛多一倍，卖的钱要多几倍。
    翁牛特旗的牲畜改良工作是从1952年开始的。那年，原热河省农业厅（翁牛特旗原属热河省，1955年热河省撤销后，始划归内蒙古自治区）先后送来二十只东北改良羊
  （蓝布列羊、高加索美利奴羊、斯达夫罗夫羊等几种细毛羊和当地羊杂交改良的后代）、六头短角种公牛、二头荷兰种公牛和数头朝鲜种公牛，派来四名畜牧技术人员。东北农业科学研究所也派专人来指导。
    一件新的工作，开始总要遇到许多困难。当时，配种技术不够熟练，群众不习惯，事事缺乏经验。为了让群众了解改良畜种的好处，热河省农业厅的马厅长，曾带着良种牲畜的图片，亲自到牧区向群众宣传。
    用人工授精的办法给牲畜配种，牧民从来没有听说过，一见就怪起来了：“嘿，瞎胡整咧！要是打针（指注射精液）能生下羊羔，还要那羊趴子（公羊）干啥哩！”有些老年人一碰见给牲畜进行人工授精，不是撇嘴，就是扭脸。配种站的房子，谁也不去。坏分子也乘机造谣破坏。
    第二年春天，第一代杂种羊羔生下来了。牧民又看不惯，说它光腚子（初生的杂种羊羔，毛稀而短）没尾巴，毛色杂。从头到尾，一处也看不上。“看这红不楞登的，猫不是猫，狗不是狗，像个啥？”谁看了都要议论一番。
    可是不出半月，小羊羔就长了一身密密的卷毛儿，个子又大。到秋天一剪毛，一岁的羔子，足顶上一只本地的大羊出毛多；拿到供销社去卖，一斤能顶二斤的价钱。这一下，牧民的看法才开始改变了：
  “咳呀，改良羊羔就是好嗳！再配种要多配上几只！”
    翁牛特旗人民委员会农牧科负责领导全族牲畜改良工作的哈斯达莱同志，在向我介绍情况时，曾再三强调说明：在配种期间，对临时畜群管理的好坏，是决定配种成效的重要因素。因为在秋季母羊临近发情期以前，各村牧民就把要配种的羊赶到配种站。每个配种站要集中五百到八百只羊，临时放牧一个半月。稍不注意，就会引起混乱和损失。
      “头一年我们对这事不注意，事实狠狠教训了我们！”哈斯达莱回忆起当时的情况说：“当时，牧场选择得不好，临时找来的牧工也不大负责任，弄得母畜都掉了膘，影响了发情和受胎。在羊群集中时，我们也没有严格检查病疫，各种疫病互相传染。配种以后，牧民往回赶母畜的时候，又发生了错拿、丢失的混乱现象。
      “后来，我们每年都十分注意这个工作。在夏季就预先选定牧场；聘请优秀的牧工；做到草场好，放牧好，不生病，增加膘，羊的受胎率都在90％以上。”
    旗的党、政领导人把改良牲畜品种作为发展畜牧业生产中一项重要的工作，经常帮助他们总结经验，动员各方面的力量加以支援。牲畜的改良工作逐年发展扩大。1952年只有三个配种站，配种母羊一千九百只。到1955年，已发展到十六个配种站，配种母羊六千五百只、母牛321头。今年准备设十八个站，配种母羊将比去年扩大一倍，牛的配种数目将扩大五倍。
    特别重要的是，在几年来的工作中，已经培养了一批本民族的牧民技术员，使配种工作在群众中生了根。各配种站每年都吸收几个牧民积极分子——大部分是村的爱畜委员，用带徒弟的办法向他们传授技术。现在有三十名牧民成了配种站的工作人员；还有二十来名牧民，已能掌握人工授精的技术。今年，他们准备把四处配种站完全交给牧民去作，旗里只派一个技术人员加以指导就行了。现在全旗90％以上的牧民都已加入牧业生产合作社。这就使牲畜改良工作具备了更加有利的条件。
    翁牛特旗已经制定了改良牲畜品种的长期规划：到1962年，将完成全旗绵羊的改良工作。到那时，全旗将有二十五万只改良羊。牛的改良工作到1967年完成。那时，全旗将有良种牛二十五万五千头。根据过去的经验和已有的工作基础，他们完全有信心完成这一计划。
