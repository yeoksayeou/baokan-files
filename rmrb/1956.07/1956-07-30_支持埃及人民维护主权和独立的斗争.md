The Egyptian people have taken another step forward in their heroic struggle to safeguard their sovereignty and independence.

On July 26, Liberation Square in Alexandria resounded with the proud laughter of the independent Egyptian people. Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser announced a decree nationalizing the Suez Canal Company. He also announced that Egypt would use the company's revenue to build the Aswan Dam.

The Egyptian people cheered the Egyptian government's decisive action. All people around the world who oppose colonialism and support national independence also expressed their sincere support and congratulations for Egypt's action to safeguard its sovereignty and independence. Those who once vainly attempted to strangle Egypt's independence by refusing to help build the Aswan Dam were greatly dismayed and extremely angry.

However, the consternation of the colonialists only shows that they fundamentally do not understand what the independence of the Egyptian people means. They still look at Egypt with old eyes, thinking that the Egyptian people can continue to tolerate the shackles of those unequal treaties imposed on them. And their anger is completely unjustified. They have no right to be angry. The Egyptian people have the right to be angry, because the colonialists, through the Suez Canal Company, have robbed them of hundreds of millions of dollars worth of property that should belong to the Egyptian people. When the Egyptian government announced the nationalization of the Suez Canal Company, it did not ask the colonialists to return this huge sum of stolen money, which is precisely a manifestation of the broad-mindedness of an independent people not dwelling on the past.

Now, the colonialists are clamoring that the Egyptian government's nationalization of the Suez Canal Company is a so-called "violation of a solemn international agreement" and a so-called "threat to peace." They are planning to use this excuse to file charges with the United Nations Security Council and the International Court of Justice, and to send their troops to the Suez Canal area to threaten the Egyptian people with force.

However, the colonialists' excuse is utterly absurd and ridiculous. Everyone knows that the 1866 agreement and subsequent agreements imposed on the Egyptian people regarding the Suez Canal Company are typical unequal treaties used by colonialists to shackle and exploit oppressed people. The Chinese people have suffered greatly from such unequal treaties and can therefore fully understand the Egyptian people's hatred for these agreements. An independent country cannot tolerate being continuously bound by such unequal treaties. The Egyptian people have written a new chapter in Egyptian history. Unequal treaties from ninety years ago are worthless today. The independent Egyptian people have every right to declare the abolition of such enslaving treaties.

Imperialists have always used the Suez Canal Zone as a military base for preparing for war and suppressing the people of the Middle East. As long as they still control the Suez Canal Company, they can still use various excuses to return to this area and push the Egyptian and Middle Eastern people into the abyss of war. The Egyptian government's nationalization of the Suez Canal Company has permanently eradicated the old roots of imperialist adventurers in the Suez Canal Zone, making the Suez Canal no longer a paradise for international adventurers, but instead serving normal international shipping and trade, and removing a major threat to peace in the Middle East. This is a valuable contribution to world peace.

The colonialists should now understand that once a long-oppressed people have tasted the flavor of independence, they would rather die than give up independence and freedom, and they can accomplish earth-shattering feats. Threats and intimidation are of no use to people who understand the meaning of "give me liberty or give me death." Now, except for a small number of colonialists, all peace-loving and freedom-loving people around the world stand on the side of the Egyptian people. The Egyptian government's heroic action to reclaim the Suez Canal Company will greatly encourage the courage and confidence of people around the world who are striving for independence and freedom to fight against the colonialists.

It should be pointed out that the colonialists will never give up. However, we believe that as long as the Egyptian people maintain a high degree of vigilance and unite as one, they will be able to thwart any colonialist conspiracies and tricks, achieve success in all aspects of Egyptian construction and revitalization, and achieve continuous victories in the struggle to safeguard their independence and sovereignty.

### 支持埃及人民维护主权和独立的斗争

    支持埃及人民维护主权和独立的斗争
    埃及人民又在维护自己的主权和独立的英勇斗争中前进了一步。
    七月二十六日，亚历山大港的解放广场上响彻着独立了的埃及人民的自豪的欢笑声。埃及总统阿卜杜勒·纳赛尔在这里宣布了把苏彝士运河公司收归国有的法令。他并且宣布，埃及将用这家公司的收入来建造阿斯旺水坝。
    埃及人民欢呼埃及政府这个果断的行动。全世界一切反对殖民主义、支持民族独立的人民，也都对埃及这个维护主权和独立的行动表示衷心的支持和祝贺。而那些曾经妄想用拒绝援助修建阿斯旺水坝来绞杀埃及的独立的人们，却大为惊恐而且愤怒万分。
    可是，殖民主义者的惊恐，正好说明了他们根本不了解埃及人民的独立意味着什么。他们还用旧的眼光去看待埃及，以为埃及人民还能继续容忍那些强加在他们身上的不平等条约的束缚。而他们的愤怒是完全没有道理的。他们没有权利愤怒。有权利愤怒的是埃及人民，因为殖民主义者通过苏彝士运河公司，抢走了数以亿计的应该属于埃及人民的财产。埃及政府在宣布把苏彝士运河公司收归国有的时候，并没有向殖民主义者们索回这笔巨额的赃款，这正是独立了的人民不究既往的宽大胸襟的表现。
    现在，殖民主义者们叫嚷说，埃及政府把苏彝士运河公司收归国有，是所谓“违反了一项庄严的国际协定”，是所谓“对和平的一个威胁”。他们正在打算利用这种借口去向联合国安全理事会和国际法院告状，把他们的军队派到苏彝士运河地区去，去对埃及人民进行武力威胁。
    但是，殖民主义者的这个借口是十分荒谬可笑的。谁都知道，1866年以及后来强加在埃及人民头上的关于苏彝士运河公司的协定，是典型的殖民主义者用来束缚和剥削被压迫人民的不平等条约。中国人民曾经吃尽了这种不平等条约的苦头，因此完全可以理解埃及人民对于这些协定的憎恨。一个独立了的国家，是不能容忍继续受这种不平等条约的束缚的。埃及人民已经给埃及历史写下了新的史章。九十年以前的不平等条约，在今天已经一钱不值。独立了的埃及人民完全有权利宣布废除这种奴役性的条约。
    帝国主义者一直把苏彝士运河区作为他们准备战争和镇压中东人民的军事基地。只要他们仍然控制着苏彝士运河公司，他们就仍然可以利用种种借口回到这个地区来，把埃及人民和中东人民推进战争的火坑。埃及政府把苏彝士运河公司收归国有，就永远铲除了帝国主义冒险家在苏彝士运河区的老根，使苏彝士运河不再成为国际冒险家的乐园，转而为国际间的正常航运和贸易服务，解除了对中东和平的一个重大的威胁。这正是对世界和平的一个有价值的贡献。
    殖民主义者们现在应当懂得，长期受压迫的人民一旦尝到了独立的滋味，他们就宁死也不愿放弃独立和自由，他们就能做出惊天动地的事业。威胁、恫吓，对于懂得“不自由毋宁死”的意义的人民是丝毫没有作用的。现在，除了一小撮殖民主义者以外，全世界爱好和平和自由的人民都站在埃及人民这一边。埃及政府收回苏彝士运河公司的英勇行动，将要大大鼓舞全世界争取独立和自由的人民同殖民主义者进行斗争的勇气和信心。
    应该指出，殖民主义者是绝不会就此罢休的。但是，我们相信，只要埃及人民保持高度的警惕，团结一致，他们就能挫败殖民主义者的任何阴谋诡计，就能使埃及建设和复兴的各方面都得到成就，就能在维护自己的独立和主权的斗争中取得不断的胜利。
