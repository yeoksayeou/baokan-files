    The automated grain destoner, worth thirteen thousand yuan, has been sitting idle and unattended in the Hangzhou No. 1 Rice Mill since 1954. This complete imported machine was allocated by the Ministry of Food based on the fact that Hangzhou had an automated grain processing plant. However, it turned out that the capacity of this destoner was half that of the mill's grinders, making it incompatible, and thus it has been left unused for a long time. (Zhang Xingya)

    粮食吸石机的恶运
    价值一万三千元的自动化粮食吸石机，从1954年以来一直堆放在杭州市第一碾米厂无人过问。这部完整的进口机器是粮食部根据杭州有一座自动化粮食加工厂分配来的，哪知这部吸石机比厂里的磨机生产能力要小一半，不相适应，这样就被长期弃置不用了。（张醒亚）
