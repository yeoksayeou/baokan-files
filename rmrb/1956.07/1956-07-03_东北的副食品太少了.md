    Northeast Lacks Sufficient Non-Staple Foods
    In recent years, more and more southerners have come to the Northeast to participate in national construction. They deeply feel that the Northeast lacks sufficient non-staple foods, making life very inconvenient. Some non-staple food stores in cities only have fresh meat. In the high-end goods section of the Changchun No. 2 Department Store, only some processed sealed sausages and ham can be found. Could the non-staple food departments in the Northeast find ways to increase the variety of processed meat products? The Northeast also lacks vegetables, with only about ten kinds such as Chinese cabbage and radish. Southern vegetables like amaranth, rapeseed, and mustard greens are not available. Although the weather in the Northeast is cold, most southern vegetables can be grown in the Northeast. It is suggested that relevant departments collect some vegetable seeds that are not available in the Northeast from the south and try planting them, so that people living in the Northeast can also eat a variety of delicious vegetables.

    东北的副食品太少了
    近几年，到东北参加祖国建设的南方人越来越多，他们深深感到东北的副食品太少，生活很不方便。有些城市的副食品门市部只有鲜肉，在长春第二百货公司高级商品部，也只看到一点加过工的封肠，火腿。东北的副食品部门能不能设法增加一些肉类加工品？东北的蔬菜也太少，只有白菜、萝卜等十种左右，像南方的苋菜、油菜、芥菜等都没有。东北的天气固然冷，但是，南方的蔬菜大多数在东北也可以种植。建议有关部门到南方收集一些东北没有的蔬菜种籽，试种一下，使住在东北的人们也能够吃到多种多样美味的蔬菜。　（王华）
