Response to Criticism

    Fire Clay Has an Owner
    Following the publication of an article titled "Lost and Found" in this newspaper on July 5th, which reported on the waste of state property by Exploration Team 315, formerly under the Ministry of Heavy Industry, the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry sent an urgent telegram to Manager Cao of the Guangzhou Exploration Company on July 6th. The telegram instructed Manager Cao to immediately dispatch a section chief and the original personnel involved to handle the matter, allocate the fire clay to the Hunan Refractory Materials Factory for use without compensation, and report the handling process to the Ministry in order to draw lessons from it.
    The Ministry of Metallurgical Industry's attention to the newspaper's criticism and its timely measures to deal with the matter will enable the state property, which has been unattended for three years, to serve the cause of construction again.

专栏：对批评的反应

    耐火粘土有了主人
    本报在本月五日用“失物招领”为题，发表了原重工业部所属315勘探队浪费国家财产的文章后，冶金工业部在七月六日给广州勘探公司曹经理发了一份加急电报。责成曹经理即日派一个科长和原经办人员前去处理这件事，把耐火粘土无代价的拨给湖南耐火材料厂使用，并且把处理经过报部，以便从中吸取经验教训。
    冶金工业部这样重视报纸的批评，及时采取措施处理这件事，将使三年无人过问的国家财产，又能为建设事业服务了。
