(Kunming Dispatch) In order to strive for increased production in over 90% of agricultural producers' cooperatives and increased income for over 90% of cooperative members, the Yunnan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has issued a decision on carrying out summer rectification and improvement of agricultural producers' cooperatives. The decision requires that all of the province's more than 30,000 agricultural producers' cooperatives must universally undergo a rectification from now until the autumn harvest, which will take two to three months. The central task of the rectification is to strive for increased production in over 90% of agricultural cooperatives and increased income for over 90% of cooperative members. The rectification method is divided into two steps: the first step is to inspect production, strengthen management, and ensure increased production; the second step is to prepare for the autumn harvest and autumn planting through pre-distribution and trial calculations. The content of the rectification includes the following three aspects: First, focusing on production inspection, convene Party branch meetings, cooperative management committee meetings, and member representative meetings to identify current problems, summarize advanced experiences, improve business management, and place the production increase plan on a reliable foundation. Second, through pre-distribution and trial calculations, further specifically solve some problems to ensure the universal increase of income for cooperative members, and make plans for the autumn harvest and autumn planting; primary cooperatives should also conduct planning for transitioning to advanced cooperatives after the autumn, according to the policies already determined by the Provincial Committee. Third, in conjunction with the rectification, rectify the rural Party grassroots organizations, emphasize improving thinking from a positive perspective, promote the style of the mass line, in order to enhance the vigorous fighting spirit of the Party branch and further exert the enthusiasm of rural Party members. The county committees and district committees, as well as the cadres assisting the agricultural cooperatives in their work, must pay attention to helping the branch and the cooperative management committee carry out constructive work from a positive perspective; it is necessary to prevent and overcome the style of only criticizing, labeling, without providing specific assistance, only holding large meetings without going deep into the countryside or production.

    以保证增加社员收入为中心
    云南省委决定整顿合作社
    本报昆明电　中共云南省委为争取90％以上的农业生产合作社增加生产和90％以上的社员增加收入，发出了关于夏季整顿提高农业生产合作社作的决定。要求全省三万多个农业生产合作社从现在起，到秋收的两三个月内，各地必须普遍地对农业生产合作社进行一次整顿。整社的中心任务是争取90％以上的农业社增加生产和90％以上的社员增加收入。整社的作法分为两步：第一步是检查生产，加强管理，保证增产；第二步是通过预分试算，准备秋收秋种。整社的内容包括以下三个方面：一、以检查生产为中心，召开党的支部大会、社管会和社员代表会，找出当前存在的问题，总结先进经验，改善经营管理，把增产计划放在可靠的基础上。二、通过预分试算去进一步具体地解决保证社员普遍增加收入的一些问题，并作出秋收秋种的计划；初级社还要根据省委已经确定的方针进行秋后转高级社的规划。三、结合整社去整顿农村党的基层组织，强调从积极方面去提高思想、提倡群众路线的作风，以便提高党支部的旺盛的战斗情绪、进一步发挥农村党员的积极性。县委和区委以及帮助农业社工作的干部，必须注意帮助支部和社管委会从正面进行建设性的工作；必须防止和克服那种只指责、戴帽子，而不去具体帮助，只开大会不深入农村、深入生产的作风。
