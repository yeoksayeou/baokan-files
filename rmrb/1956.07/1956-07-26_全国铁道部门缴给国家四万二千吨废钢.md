According to the People's Railway News: In the first half of this year, the national railway department recovered and collected more than 42,000 tons of scrap steel, turning it over to the state as smelting resources. The Dalian Steel Plant completed its production tasks in the first half of this year thanks to the timely allocation of more than 2,000 tons of scrap steel from the railway department.

Many units in the railway department have further strengthened the organization and leadership of this work to collect more scrap steel to turn over to the state, achieving remarkable results. The Taiyuan Railway Administration overfulfilled the allocation task stipulated by the Ministry of Railways in the first half of the year; the Shenyang Railway Administration Branch turned over 240 tons more scrap steel in the second quarter than planned. The material supply departments of many bureaus also organized scrap steel collection teams to go deep into the vast areas along the railway lines to collect scrap steel. The collection teams from the Fengtai and Shijiazhuang material factories went deep into the vast rural areas on both sides of the Jinggu, Jingbao, and Shitai lines, and with the help of local governments and local farmers, collected a large number of old rails and other accessories buried underground and in rivers and ditches. In the first quarter of this year, they collected 20 tons of scrap steel near Zhangjiakou alone.

    全国铁道部门缴给国家四万二千吨废钢
    据人民铁道报讯　今年上半年，全国铁道部门回收和搜集了废钢四万二千多吨上缴国家作为冶炼资源。大连钢厂今年上半年由于铁道部门及时地拨给他们二千多吨废钢，保证了生产任务的完成。
    铁道部门许多单位为了搜集更多的废钢上缴国家，进一步加强了对这一工作的组织领导，取得了显著成绩。太原铁路管理局上半年超额完成了铁道部规定的调拨任务；沈阳铁路管理分局第二季度上缴的废钢比计划多二百四十吨。许多局的材料供应部门还组织了搜集废钢铁小组，深入铁路沿线广大地区搜集废旧钢材。丰台、石家庄两个材料厂的搜集小组，深入到京古、京包、石太等线两侧的广大农村，在地方政府和当地农民的帮助下，搜集了大批埋在地下和河沟里的旧钢轨和其他配件，今年第一季度仅在张家口附近就搜集了废钢二十吨。
