Can Rice Be Grown on a Large Scale in the North?

    In many people's minds, rice is always a southern crop. In recent decades, a few areas in the north have also begun to grow rice. The "Xiaozhan Rice" near Tianjin is famous throughout the country. Everyone already believes that rice can be grown in the north. However, the rice planting area in the north is not large after all, and the total output is still not high. Therefore, many people still doubt: Is it because these places have particularly favorable conditions that they can grow rice?
    Today's "People's Daily" publishes "The Experience of High Rice Yields in the Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture," which most powerfully answers this question. It can almost be said that in our country, if appropriate measures are taken, rice can be grown everywhere.
    The rice planted by farmers in the Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture in 1955 yielded an average of nearly 500 jin per mu, and the highest yielded more than 1,300 jin per mu. This record cannot be considered low compared to single-cropping rice in the south.
    The main reason why most areas have not yet grown rice is because many farmers, including some rural work cadres, believe that the local natural conditions are not good enough and are not suitable for growing rice at all. However, please consider whether the natural conditions in the Yanbian area are very good? Obviously not. Here, the altitude is more than 500 meters above sea level, the average annual temperature is 2-4 degrees Celsius, the frost-free period is only 140-160 days, the minimum is only 110 days, and the rainfall is generally between 400-600 millimeters. Most areas north of the Yellow River have similar natural conditions. However, the rice planting area north of the Yellow River currently only accounts for about 1.65% of the cultivated land area. The farmers in the Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture can grow rice very well, so why can't other areas do the same?
    Most farmers in the north dare not grow rice, mainly because they feel that there is too little water. Is there very little water in the north? Compared with the south, it is indeed less. However, the water conservancy conditions in most areas of the north are not worse than those in the Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture; on the contrary, they are better than those there. In order to develop paddy fields, farmers in the Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture once dug water from the dry riverbeds. Isn't this spirit of actively striving for wealth from nature setting a good example for farmers across the country?
    In our country, except for a very few small areas, there are various water sources everywhere. Rainwater from the sky can be retained, spring water from underground can be drawn up, and snow and river water can be fully utilized. The agricultural history of our country is actually the history of developing water conservancy and preventing water disasters. Farmers in our country have always attached great importance to water conservancy resources. As long as we earnestly and actively discover and utilize various water sources, there can be paddy fields everywhere. After reading the experience of high rice yields in the Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture, farmers in the north should generally increase their confidence.
    Rice cultivation in the Yanbian area is also a matter of recent decades. In the process of trial planting rice, local farmers have experienced successes and failures, and there have been bumper harvests and poor harvests. However, they have always believed in their experiments and have never been discouraged. They constantly studied production techniques suitable for local natural conditions; they repeatedly learned from the experience of rice labor models in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea who had achieved a high-yield record of more than 2,800 jin per mu; they established many demonstration fields to test various high-yield experiences learned from other places, and once successful, they boldly promoted them. Successes and failures, setbacks and then successes, are phenomena that any area starting to grow rice will encounter. However, as long as we earnestly learn the tenacious spirit of the farmers in the Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture, we will inevitably be able to achieve the final victory like them.
    Rice is a high-yield crop with huge potential for increased production. According to the 1955 statistics, the rice planting area only accounted for 22.4% of the national grain crop area, while the rice yield has already accounted for 42.5% of the national total grain output, ranking first among various grain yields. From this, it can be seen how significant it is to actively promote rice planting for rapidly increasing grain production in our country and improving people's lives. Taking the situation in the Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture as an example, before rice was grown, each hectare only produced about 3,000 jin of miscellaneous grains; after rice was grown, each hectare could produce 7,000 to 8,000 jin of rice. In the past, local farmers could only eat sorghum, which was not very abundant, but now they can eat very abundant rice.
    According to the provisions of the National Agricultural Development Program (Draft), within twelve years, the rice planting area in our country will increase from the existing 430 million mu to 740 million mu (including the 140 million mu of planting area increased due to changing from single-cropping rice to double-cropping rice). Where exactly will these hundreds of millions of mu of rice planting area be opened up? The areas south of the Qinling Mountains and the Huai River have long been the main rice-producing areas in our country; these areas may continue to expand the rice area, but the quantity will not be large. Therefore, the areas where rice fields will be developed on a large scale in the future will not be in the south but in the north. Therefore, the Yanbian rice high-yield experience, which appears in the north and is suitable for the conditions of the vast areas of the north, should and must attract people's full attention.

### 北方能大量种水稻吗

    北方能大量种水稻吗
    在许多人的心目中，水稻总归是南方的农作物。近几十年来，北方的少数地区，也开始种植水稻，像天津附近的“小站稻”，便是全国著名的。北方可以种水稻，大家已经这样相信了。但是，北方的水稻种植面积毕竟不大，总产量也还不多，因此，许多人还有怀疑：这些地方所以能种水稻，是不是因为有什么特别优越的条件呢？
    本报今天发表的“延边朝鲜族自治州水稻丰产经验”，最有力地回答了这个问题。简直可以这样说，在我国，如果采取了适当的措施，到处都能种水稻。
    延边朝鲜族自治州的农民在1955年种植的水稻，每亩平均产量近五百斤，最高的每亩生产一千三百多斤。这个纪录，和南方的单季稻比较，也不能算是低的。
    现在多数地区所以还没有种水稻，主要是因为许多农民，包括某些农村工作干部，认为当地的自然条件不够好，根本不适合种水稻。可是，请看延边地区的自然条件是不是很好的呢？显然不是。这里拔海500公尺以上，常年平均温度为摄氏2—4度，无霜期只有140—160天，最少的地方只有110天，降雨量一般在400—600公厘之间。类似这样的自然条件，在黄河以北的绝大多数地区都有。但是，现在黄河以北的水稻种植面积却只相当于耕地面积的1.65％左右。延边朝鲜族自治州的农民能够把水稻种的很好，别的地区为什么就不能这样作呢？
    北方地区多数农民不敢种植水稻，主要是因为他们觉得水源太少。北方的水源是不是很少呢？跟南方比较起来，确实是要少一些。但是，北方多数地区的水利条件，不仅不比延边朝鲜族自治州的坏，反而要比那里的好。延边朝鲜族自治州的农民为了开发水田，曾经从干枯了的河滩底下挖出水来。这种积极向大自然争取财富的精神，难道不是给全国农民树立了良好榜样吗？
    在我国，除了极个别的小范围的地区以外，到处都有各种各样的水源。天上的雨水可以保留起来，地下的泉水可以汲取上来，雪水、河水更可以充分地加以利用。我国的一部农业史，实际上就是开发水利、防止水害的历史。我国农民历来是很重视水利资源的，只要认真地积极地发现和利用各种水源，到处就都可以有水田。看了延边朝鲜族自治州水稻丰产的经验，北方的农民们应该普遍提高了信心。
    延边地区种植水稻也是近几十年的事情。当地农民在试种水稻的过程中，有成功也有失败，有丰收也有歉收。但是，他们一直相信自己的试验，从来没有灰心过。他们不断地钻研适合当地自然条件的生产技术；他们几次向获得每亩两千八百多斤丰产纪录的朝鲜民主主义人民共和国水稻劳动模范学习经验；他们建立了许多示范田，试验各种从外地学来的丰产经验，一旦成功就大胆推广。有成功有失败、几经挫折然后成功，这种现象是任何开始种植水稻的地区都会遇到的。但是，只要认真地学习延边朝鲜族自治州农民的顽强精神，就必然能够像他们一样地取得最后的胜利。
    水稻是有巨大增产潜力的高产作物。根据1955年的统计，水稻的种植面积只占全国粮食作物面积的22.4％，而稻谷产量却已占全国粮食总产量的42.5％，居各种粮食产量的第一位。从这里可以看出，积极提倡种植水稻，对于迅速增加我国粮食产量，改善人民生活，具有多么重大的意义。就以延边朝鲜族自治州的情况来说，在没有种植水稻以前，那里每公顷仅仅生产三千斤左右的杂粮；种植水稻以后，每公顷却能生产七、八千斤稻谷。当地农民过去只能吃并不丰裕的高粱，现在却能吃非常丰裕的大米。
    根据全国农业发展纲要（草案）的规定，我国水稻的种植面积，在十二年以内，将要从现有的四亿三千万亩增加到七亿四千万亩（包括由于改单季稻为双季稻而增加的一亿四千万亩种植面积）。这几亿亩水稻种植面积，究竟要在什么地方开辟出来？秦岭、淮河以南地区，早已是我国水稻的主要产区；这些地区可能继续扩大水稻面积，但数量是不会多的。因此，将来大量发展稻田的地区，将不是南方而是北方。因此，出现在北方、适合北方广大地区情况的延边水稻丰产经验，就应该而且必然要引起人们的充分重视。
