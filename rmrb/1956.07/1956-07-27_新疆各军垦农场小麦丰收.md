Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi, 25th. The Xinjiang Military Region Production and Construction Corps of the Chinese People's Liberation Army is busily harvesting 500,000 mu of ripe wheat in various reclamation areas north and south of the Tianshan Mountains. This year, the wheat harvest is generally good, with dense stalks, large ears, and full grains. According to field observations, the total yield in each reclamation area will be no less than the bumper wheat harvest of 1955.

In the Shihezi Farm in the Manas River basin reclamation area, more than 94,000 mu of winter wheat has been harvested. After pre-harvest yield appraisal, the average yield per mu reached 294 jin, of which more than 6,300 mu can produce 300 to 380 jin per mu. The reclamation areas in the Ili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture have generally achieved good wheat harvests. The 10th and 12th farms' more than 15,000 mu of wheat will have an average yield of 400 jin per mu, completing the "10,000 mu, 10,000 shi" (each shi is 400 jin) plan for these two farms. The 5th farm in the Yanqi reclamation area, which is currently being harvested, has more than 20,000 mu of wheat with an average yield of more than 240 jin per mu, an increase of 52% over last year. The more than 20,000 mu of Ukrainian wheat in the Aksu oasis, which was harvested earlier, can produce 236 jin per mu.

All reclamation areas used combine harvesters and horse-drawn harvesters to harvest wheat this year, shortening the harvest period compared to previous years. During the busy wheat harvest season, the leading organs of each reclamation area organized a large number of cadres to go deep into the fields to inspect and guide the harvesting work, and to promote yield-increasing measures such as quick harvesting, quick transportation, clean harvesting, clean hauling, and thorough threshing. The wheat in each reclamation area will be fully harvested by early August.

    新疆各军垦农场小麦丰收
    新华社乌鲁木齐25日电　中国人民解放军新疆军区农业生产建设部队在天山南北各垦区，正在紧张地收割五十万亩黄熟的小麦。今年小麦普遍丰收，麦株茂密，穗大粒满，根据田间观察，各垦区总产量将不低于小麦丰收的1955年。
    玛纳斯河流域垦区石河子农场九万四千多亩冬小麦已经收完，经过收前产量鉴定，平均每亩产量达二百九十四斤，其中六千三百多亩每亩可产三百斤到三百八十斤。伊犁哈萨克族自治州各垦区小麦普遍获得丰收，第十农场和十二农场的一万五千多亩小麦平均每亩产量将达四百斤，完成了这两个农场的万亩万石（每石四百斤）计划。正在进行收割的焉耆垦区第五农场二万多亩小麦平均每亩产量二百四十多斤，比去年增产52％。收割较早的阿克苏绿洲二万多亩乌克兰种小麦每亩可产二百三十六斤。
    各垦区今年全部使用联合收割机和马拉收割机收割小麦，收割期比往年缩短了。在紧张的麦收时期，各垦区领导机关组织了大批干部深入田间检查，指导收割工作，推行快割、快运、收净、拉净、打净等增产措施。各垦区小麦在八月初可全部收割完毕。
