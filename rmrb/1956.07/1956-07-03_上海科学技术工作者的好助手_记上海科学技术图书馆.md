    A Good Helper for Shanghai Science and Technology Workers
    ——A Record of the Shanghai Science and Technology Library
    By Our Correspondent Xi Ping
    The newly established Shanghai Science and Technology Library is located on South Shaanxi Road in Shanghai. Every morning, as the city's hustle and bustle just begins, the library opens its doors to warmly welcome a steady stream of readers.

    The Shanghai Science and Technology Library's rich collection of books attracts many science and technology workers. According to incomplete statistics, the library currently holds over 60,000 books and more than 1,800 periodicals (bound into 35,000 volumes). These books and periodicals come from 46 countries around the world and are in 19 different languages. Books and periodicals on chemistry, biology, mathematics, and physics are particularly complete. For example, it has collections of Curtis's Botanical Magazine, founded in England in 1787, the Journal de Conchyliologie published in France in 1850, the Annals and Magazine of Natural History published in England in 1838, as well as the works of world-renowned scientists such as Newton, Galileo, Pavlov, and Michurin.

    The library staff has created a conducive reading environment for readers. They have opened a science popularization reading room for general readers. Popular science books and newspapers are displayed here, and anyone with an interest in scientific knowledge and a certain level of education can come to this reading room to read. The library has prepared various convenient conditions for science and technology personnel. There are special reading rooms for experts and science and technology workers. Soon, the library will also set up a reference reading room, which will concentrate a portion of important and frequently used reference materials, specifically for experts conducting professional research on a particular issue.

    Due to the needs of their work, the library's managers, in addition to understanding the library's own business knowledge, are also familiar with some scientific knowledge and foreign languages, because they not only have to quickly and accurately provide readers with many books, but also act as consultants for readers. The managers here often encounter the following situation: after a college student or factory technician comes to the library, he himself does not know which book contains the material he needs, or which one to read. At this time, the manager will introduce him to the appropriate book. On March 30th of this year, an electrical engineering technician came to the library, wanting to know about photos and diagrams of 6,000-volt to 10,000-volt indoor distribution equipment, but he did not know where to find them. The manager selected the materials he needed from hundreds of books.

    The Science and Technology Library also has a set of document reproduction equipment, to reproduce the documents needed by readers at home and abroad for scientific and technological research, either by photographic reproduction or by typewriter. Readers only need to specify the title and page of the materials they need, and the library can handle it for them. Since February of this year, many important documents have been requested for reproduction from all over the country, such as Dalian Institute of Technology, a basic construction office in Guangzhou, Shanghai Smelter, and East China Institute of Chemical Technology. Zhou Dingxin, a young technician from the state-owned Shanghai Precision Medical Instrument Manufacturing Factory, also reproduced important materials here in the process of researching and manufacturing cadmium sulfide photo-sensitive semiconductors. The library staff treats the readers' achievements in research work as their own achievements in their work.

    The predecessor of the Shanghai Science and Technology Library was the Shanghai Mingfu Library. As early as thirty years ago, the pioneers of our country's scientific community established a scientific organization—the Science Society of China. The Mingfu Library was founded by scientists within the Science Society who were enthusiastic about the country's scientific cause. Domestic and foreign scientists have donated a large number of books and periodicals to this library. Last year, in order to enable the library to develop further and make more contributions to the country's scientific and technological work, the scientists of the Science Society of China dedicated this library, which had been cultivated for many years, to the country. Subsequently, the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Culture accepted the collections donated by the Chinese Chemical Industry Society, the former Chinese Institute of Engineers, the Chinese Mechanical Engineering Society, and the Electrical Engineering Society. Now, all these books have been concentrated in the Science and Technology Library.

    In order to meet the needs of the country's scientific and technological research work, the Shanghai Science and Technology Library was officially established on February 19th of this year at the former site of the Mingfu Library. Under the call of "marching towards science," the library has been facing an increasing number of readers from the very beginning. The number of readers coming to this library every day exceeds the highest record in the past thirty years. The original equipment and manpower are far from meeting the needs of readers. This year, the state allocated 100,000 yuan to the library to add new books. The library staff is now actively planning to add a batch of useful books and periodicals for scientific research work.

    上海科学技术工作者的好助手
    ——记上海科学技术图书馆
    本报记者　习平
    上海市新成立的科学技术图书馆，设在上海的陕西南路。每天清早，当城市的喧嚣刚刚开始的时候，图书馆就打开大门，热忱地接待川流不息的读者。
    上海科学技术图书馆的丰富的藏书，吸引了许多科学、技术工作者。据不完全的统计，目前在这座图书馆里约有存书六万册以上，杂志一千八百多种（分册装成合订本三万五千册）。这些书刊来自世界上四十六个国家，包括十九种不同的文字。其中化学、生物学、数学、物理学等科目的书刊特别完整。如1787年在英国创刊的柯氏植物学报，1850年在法国出版的贝壳学杂志，1838年英国出版的自然历史学报，以及世界著名的科学家如牛顿、伽利略、巴甫洛夫、米丘林等人的著作，都有收藏。
    图书馆的工作人员为读者布置了一个便于阅读的环境。他们为一般的读者开辟了一个科学普及阅览室。这里陈列着通俗的科学普及书报，凡是对科学知识有兴趣的、具有一定文化水平的人都可以到这个阅览室来阅览。图书馆更为科学、技术人员准备了各种便利的条件。这里设有专家和科学技术工作者的专门的阅览室。不久，图书馆还要专门布置一个参考阅览室，在这里集中一部分重要的通常要用的参考资料，专门供给对某一个问题进行专业研究的专家使用。
    这个图书馆的管理人员，由于工作的需要，他们除了懂得图书馆的本身业务知识以外，还熟悉一些科学知识和外国语文，因为他们不但要经常迅速准确地供给读者许多书，同时还要做读者的顾问。这里的管理人员常常碰到这样的情况：一个大学生或者工厂技术人员来到图书馆以后，他本人不知道哪一本书里有他需要的材料，不知道读哪一本好，这时管理人员就把适当的书介绍给他。今年三月三十日，有一个电气工程技术人员来到图书馆，他想知道六千伏到一万伏室内配电设备的附照和图解，但是他不知道在哪一本书里可以找到，管理人员就在几百本书中给他挑选出他所需要的资料。
    科学技术图书馆还设置了一套复制文献的设备，为外地和本市读者复制他们在科学技术研究上所需要的文献，或者是采用摄影翻印，或者是用打字机打印。读者只要指定他所需要的材料的书名篇页，图书馆就可以替他办理。从今年二月开始，从全国各地，如大连工学院，广州市的某基本建设处，上海冶炼厂，华东化工学院都曾要求图书馆替他们复制许多的重要文献。国营上海精密医疗器械制造厂青年技术员周鼎新，在研究制造硫化镉光敏半导体的过程中，也曾经在这里复制过重要资料。图书馆的工作人员把读者在研究工作上的成就，当作自己在工作上的成绩一样的高兴。
    上海科学技术图书馆的前身是上海明复图书馆。远在三十年前，我国科学界的先辈成立了一个科学界的组织—中国科学社，明复图书馆就是由科学社内热心于祖国科学事业的科学家们创办起来的。国内和国外的科学工作者曾经给这个图书馆捐赠了大批的书刊。去年，中国科学社的科学家们为了使图书馆能得到更大的发展，为国家科学技术工作作出更多贡献，将这座多年培植的图书馆献给了国家。接着，上海市文化局又接受了中华化学工业会、前中国工程师学会、中国机械工程学会、电机工程学会献出的藏书。现在，这些书籍都已经全部集中在科学技术图书馆。
    为了适应国家开展科学技术研究工作的需要，今年二月十九日，上海科学技术图书馆在明复图书馆的旧址宣告正式成立。在“向科学进军”的号召下，图书馆一开始就面对着日益增多的读者。每天来到这个图书馆的读者，超过三十年来一天的最高纪录。原有的设备和人力已经远远不能满足读者的要求。今年国家拨了十万元经费给图书馆添置新书。图书馆的工作人员现在正在积极筹划，为科学研究工作添置一批有用的好书刊。
