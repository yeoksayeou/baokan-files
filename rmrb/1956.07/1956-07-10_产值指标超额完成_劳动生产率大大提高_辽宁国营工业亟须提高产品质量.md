This newspaper's Shenyang dispatch on the 9th: State-owned industries in the Liaoning area have exceeded their production value and labor productivity targets for the first half of this year. In the first half of the year, the total output value plan was fulfilled by 101.9%, accounting for 47.4% of the total annual output value plan. In terms of speed, the original output value plan for the first half of the year was 31% higher than last year, but the actual increase was 39.3% higher than last year. The labor productivity plan was fulfilled even better. The average annual increase in labor productivity in state-owned industries in Liaoning has historically been only 16% to 18%, but the actual increase in the first half of the year was 36%.

However, from the overall implementation of the plan in the first half of this year, apart from the quantitative indicators, other indicators have not been fulfilled well enough. From a regional perspective, only Shenyang fully completed the plan from January to May among the ten cities in the province, with Anshan being the worst performer, failing to meet any of the four indicators from January to May. Lüda and Benxi only completed two indicators. In particular, the quality indicators were the worst performed.

In the high tide of production, many units one-sidedly pursued output and neglected quality. This phenomenon did not significantly change in the second quarter. Many units still remained at the stage of ideological criticism and general appeals on the issue of quality, lacking practical and specific measures. In some units, quality not only did not improve but even fluctuated and declined. From January to May, one-third to two-thirds of more than 30 heavy industrial products failed to meet national quality standards, and the quality of 26 of the 44 comparable heavy industrial products declined compared to the fourth quarter of last year. The quality of most products from Anshan Iron and Steel, except for thin plates and pig iron, declined. The first-class rate of heavy rail steel was 91.4% in the fourth quarter of last year, but this year the highest was 87% and the lowest was 82%, failing to reach the level already achieved last year. The first-class rate of large steel had reached 93.9% last year, but this year it is all below 89%. The quality plans for high-quality steel ingots and high-quality steel materials at Fushun Steel Plant have not been completed for five consecutive months. Among them, the waste products of high-quality steel materials increased by 3.4 times compared to the same period last year. Benxi Steel Plant failed to meet the quality indicators for high-quality steel materials for three out of five months. The quality of raw coal has also declined seriously. Among the 45 batches of coking coal allocated to Anshan by the Longfeng Mine in Fushun in May, 20 batches were substandard. The quality of some factories and mines is still declining month by month. The processing scrap rate of Shenyang Universal Machinery Plant rose more than twofold in May compared to March.

The direct causes of product quality fluctuations and declines, in addition to the influence of technical level and raw material quality, are mainly violations of operating procedures, rush production, and overtime work. The director of the rolling mill workshop at Benxi Steel Plant mistakenly believed that violating procedures was necessary to complete the task, and strict adherence to procedures would make it impossible to complete the task. As a result, there were 545 violations of operating procedures from January to April, an increase of 77% compared to the fourth quarter of last year, and the number of defective products also increased by 1.7 times. Leading cadres of Dalian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Manufacturing Plant took the lead in violating operating procedures and adopting the abominable means of reducing product quality in order to rush to meet the task. As a result, 603 tons of metal were scrapped from January to April, resulting in a loss of 400,000 yuan, and the national plan was not completed for five consecutive months.

In addition, state-owned industries in the Liaoning area also have many serious shortcomings in ensuring production safety, reducing costs, and trial-manufacturing new products in the first half of the year.

### 产值指标超额完成　劳动生产率大大提高  辽宁国营工业亟须提高产品质量

    产值指标超额完成　劳动生产率大大提高
    辽宁国营工业亟须提高产品质量
    本报沈阳9日电　辽宁地区国营工业超额完成今年上半年生产总值和劳动生产率指标。上半年，总产值计划完成了101.9％，为全年总产值计划的47.4％。从速度上来看，上半年原订产值计划较去年提高31％，但实际达到的比去年提高了39.3％。劳动生产率计划完成得更好，辽宁地区国营工业历年劳动生产率平均只提高16％到18％，上半年实际提高了36％。
    但从今年上半年整个计划执行情况来看，除了数量指标外，其它指标都完成得不够好。从地区来看，全省十个城市一至五月全面完成计划的只有沈阳一个城市，完成最差的是鞍山，一至五月的四个指标一个也没有完成。旅大和本溪只完成了两个指标。其中特别是质量指标完成得最不好。
    在生产高潮中，许多单位片面追求产量，忽视质量，到第二季度这种现象仍然没有显著改变，许多单位对质量问题仍然停留在思想批判和一般号召上，缺少切实具体的措施。有的单位质量不仅没有改进，反而有波动和下降的趋势。一至五月份，三十多项重工业产品中有三分之一到三分之二弱达不到国家的质量标准，44项可比的重工业产品的质量，有26项比去年第四季度下降。鞍钢除薄板、生铁外，多数产品的质量是下降的。重轨钢材去年第四季度一级品达91.4％，但今年最高是87％，最低是82％，都没有达到去年已达到的水平。大型钢材去年一级品曾达93.9％，今年都在89％以下。抚顺钢厂的优质钢锭和优质钢材连续五个月没有完成质量计划，其中优质钢材废品较去年同期增加了3.4倍。本溪钢厂优质钢材五个月有三个月没有达到质量指标。原煤质量下降也很严重。抚顺龙凤矿五月份拨给鞍山的四十五批炼焦煤中就有二十批不合格。有些厂矿质量还在逐月下降。沈阳通用机器厂加工废品率五月比三月上升一倍多。
    产品质量波动和下降的直接原因，除技术水平和原材料质量的影响外，主要是违反工艺规程，突击生产和加班加点。本溪钢厂轧钢车间主任错误地认为要想完成任务就得违反规程，要严格执行规程就休想完成任务。因而一至四月违反操作规程545次，较去年第四季度增加77％，废品也随之增加了一点七倍。大连机车车辆制造厂领导干部为了赶任务，竟带头违反工艺规程，采取降低产品质量的恶劣手段，结果一至四月报废金属603吨，损失四十万元，一连五个月没有完成国家计划。
    此外，上半年辽宁地区的国营工业在保障生产的安全、在降低成本和新产品试制方面，也都存在着许多严重的缺点。
