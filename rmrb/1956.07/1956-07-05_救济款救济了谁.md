    Who Did the Relief Funds Relieve?
    Editor:
    In March, the higher authorities allocated 1,600 yuan in social relief funds to our Xinhuang Township to solve the living difficulties of households in need, in order to promote spring plowing production. However, up to now, only 830 yuan has actually been distributed to needy households. Some needy households have not received any relief. Where did the remaining money go? It turns out that some of it was distributed to cadres. For example, the family of cadre Wu Weijun recently received two relief payments, totaling 50 yuan. What difficulties does he have? He just lacks things like a thermos and soap, so he used the relief money to buy these things. I don't understand, is this kind of practice allowed?

### 救济款救济了谁

    救济款救济了谁
    编辑同志：
    三月份上级拨给我们新篁乡社会救济款一千六百元，解决困难户的生活困难，以便推动春耕生产。但是到目前为止，只有八百三十元真正发放到困难户手里。还有一些困难户没有得到救济。剩下的钱哪里去了呢？原来有一部分是发放给干部了。例如干部吴伟君家属最近就拿到两次救济款，共五十元，他有什么困难呢？就是缺乏热水瓶、肥皂之类，所以他用救济款买了这些东西。我不明白，这种作法能允许吗？
