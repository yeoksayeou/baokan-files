    Model Photography Design Method
    The General Planning Group of the Fourth Design Bureau of the First Ministry of Machine Building, using Czechoslovakia's advanced design experience - "Model Photography Design Method," has increased work efficiency by two to six times. The "Model Photography Design Method" uses wooden or paper-cut models as factory building models. Designers can arbitrarily adjust and change the positions of these models and then photograph them.

    模型照相设计法
    第一机械工业部第四设计分局总平面组运用捷克斯洛伐克的先进设计经验——“模型照相设计法”，使工作效率提高两倍到六倍以上。“模型照相设计法”是用木制的或用纸片剪的模型作厂房模型，设计人员可以任意调整和改换这些模型位置，然后把它拍成照片。
