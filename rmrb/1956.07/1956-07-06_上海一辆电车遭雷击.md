    Shanghai, July 4th (reporter dispatch) On July 2nd at around 8 PM, Shanghai experienced torrential rain. Tram No. 116 of Route 6, running on Fuzhou Road Bund, was struck by lightning, causing a fire in the car. Sixteen passengers were injured. After being rushed to the hospital for emergency treatment, most have been safely discharged. Two passengers with more severe injuries are still hospitalized, but their lives are not in danger. On the morning of July 3rd, the Shanghai Public Utilities Bureau, the Hunnan Depot, and the Huangpu Public Security Bureau sent personnel to the hospital and the homes of the injured passengers to express their condolences.
    This is the first time since the liberation of Shanghai that a tram has been struck by lightning and caused injuries. The Shanghai Public Utilities Bureau conducted a technical inspection of the accident and initially determined that the tram was equipped with an old-fashioned horn-type lightning arrester. If the lightning current is too strong, this type of arrester produces a large amount of heat from the large arc, causing the air to expand, leading to explosions and combustion. At the same time, the position of the arrester was also incorrect. Generally, tram arresters are installed on the roof of the car, but the No. 116 tram had it installed inside the car. Based on this inspection, the Shanghai Public Utilities Bureau has decided to take technical measures to prevent similar accidents from happening again.

    上海一辆电车遭雷击
    本报上海4日电　七月二日下午八时光景，上海暴雨如注，行驶在福州路外滩的六路有轨电车第一一六号车遭受雷击，车厢起火，十六名乘客受伤，经送医院急救后，大都已安全出院，还有两个伤势较重的乘客仍住院治疗，也无生命危险。三日上午，上海市公用事业管理局、沪南车场和黄浦公安分局，都派员到医院和受伤乘客家中进行慰问。
    电车遭到雷击，并发生伤人事故，这是上海解放后第一次发生的事情。上海市公用事业管理局对这次事故进行了技术检查，初步查明原因是这辆有轨电车装着老式的羊角式的避雷器。这种避雷器，如果雷击电流过大，大电弧就产生大量的热能，造成空气膨胀，引起爆炸和燃烧。同时避雷器装置的位置也不对，一般电车的避雷器都装在车厢顶上，而一一六号电车却装在车厢里面。上海市公用事业管理局根据这次检查，已决定采取技术措施，防止再发生类似事故。
