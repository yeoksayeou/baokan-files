Liaoning: 25 Factory and Mine Construction Projects Underway

    (Our Dispatch from Shenyang) This year, Liaoning Province has 25 major factories and mines, including Anshan Iron and Steel Company, Fuxin Power Plant, Benxi Gongyuan Steel Plant, Dalian Heavy Machinery Plant, Shenyang Smelter, Shenyang Transformer Factory, Jinzhou Petroleum Factory No. 6, Fushun Victory Inclined Shaft, and Wafangdian Bearing Factory, starting and continuing intense reconstruction and expansion work. Anshan Iron and Steel Company plans to renovate six blast furnaces during the First Five-Year Plan. In addition to the four blast furnaces that have already been renovated, Blast Furnace No. 9 will also be completed this year. With the completion of the new blast furnace renovation, Anshan Iron and Steel's production capacity will increase by 230% compared to 1952. The planned output of transformers at the Shenyang Transformer Factory after renovation in the fourth quarter of this year will increase by 120% compared to the highest quarter in 1955. Last year, the largest capacity transformer produced by this factory was only 31,500 kVA. After the renovation, the first modern giant transformer with a capacity of 40,500 kVA will be produced in November of this year.

    Among the 25 major factories and mines being expanded and renovated this year, nine, including the Fuxin Power Plant, Shenyang Transformer Factory, Jinzhou Petroleum Factory No. 6, and Fushun Victory Inclined Shaft, will be fully renovated within this year.

Zhejiang: 121 New and Expanded Factories and Mines

    (Our Dispatch from Hangzhou) Zhejiang Province will build and expand 121 factories and mines this year. The amount of investment in basic construction is equivalent to the total investment in the first three years of the province's First Five-Year Plan. Currently, 70 factories and mines have already started or are about to start construction in the first half of the year, and the remaining factories and mines are planned to start construction in the third quarter of this year.

    After these newly built and expanded factories and mines are put into production, they will play a significant role in supporting national construction and meeting the needs of the people's lives. The Suichang Pyrite Mine, which is under construction, will be able to extract more than 4,500 tons of pyrite annually after it is put into production. After the renovation of the Hangzhou Power Plant, it will increase its power generation by 10,000 kW. The newly built Zhejiang Agricultural Machinery Factory is expected to produce 3,500 paddy field plows next year.

    In order to adapt to the increasingly developing fishing industry in the coastal areas of Zhejiang, shipyards have also been built and expanded in Ningbo and Zhoushan.

    辽宁25个厂矿建设工程紧张施工
    浙江新建扩建121个厂矿
    本报沈阳电　辽宁地区今年有鞍山钢铁公司、阜新发电厂、本溪工源钢厂、大连起重机器厂、沈阳冶炼厂、沈阳变压器厂、锦州石油六厂、抚顺胜利斜井、瓦房店轴承厂等二十五个主要厂矿开始和继续进行紧张的改建、扩建工作。鞍山钢铁公司在第一个五年计划期间计划改建的六个高炉，除过去已经改建完工的四个高炉以外，今年又有九号高炉可以改建完毕。由于新的高炉改建完工，鞍钢铁的生产能力将比1952年提高230％。沈阳变压器厂今年第四季度改建以后的变压器计划产量，将比1955年最高的一个季度的产量提高1.2倍。去年这个厂生产的变压器，最大容量只有三万一千五百千伏安，改建以后，今年十一月份就可以生产出第一台四万零五百千伏安的现代化的巨型变压器。
    今年扩建、改建的二十五个主要厂矿中，阜新发电厂、沈阳变压器厂、锦州石油六厂、抚顺胜利斜井等九个厂矿将在今年内全部改建完毕。
    本报杭州电　浙江省今年将新建、扩建一百二十一个厂矿，基本建设投资额相当于全省第一个五年计划头三年的投资总和。现在，上半年已经开工和即将开工的有七十个厂矿，其余厂矿计划在今年第三季度全部动工。
    这些新建和扩建的厂矿投入生产后，对支援国家建设和满足人民生活需要将起很大的作用。正在建设的遂昌黄铁矿，投入生产后每年能开采黄铁矿四千五百吨以上。杭州电厂改建以后，将增加发电量一万瓩。新建的浙江农业机械厂，预计明年生产水田机拉犁三千五百台。
    为了适应浙江沿海日益发展的渔业生产，还在宁波和舟山两地，兴建和扩建了造船厂。
