    Mapping the Area Between Lanzhou, Jiuquan, and Taldin
    Large-Scale Aerial Photography Begins
    (Our dispatch from Jiuquan, July 3rd) The aerial photography team of the Surveying and Mapping Bureau of the Ministry of Geology has begun aerial photography work over the vast area between Lanzhou, Jiuquan, and Taldin. They will use the aerial photography data to map the geology of this area. The aerial photography work began on May 20th, and by the end of June, the original task of photographing 30,000 square kilometers had been overfulfilled.

    Within this team is a group of Soviet experts. In addition to flying daily to complete photography tasks, they are also responsible for teaching aerial photography techniques to all the Chinese staff in the team. It is expected that by the end of October, all staff will be familiar with the entire set of aerial photography techniques and be able to operate independently.

    Aerial photography is a new undertaking that greatly improves the efficiency of mapmaking and ensures quality. A task that would take at least ten years to complete by manual surveying can be done in just over four months using aerial photography methods. This is of great significance for ensuring good geological exploration work and identifying underground mineral deposits.

    填绘兰州、酒泉、塔尔丁之间的地图
    空中摄影大规模展开
    本报酒泉3日电　兰州、酒泉和塔尔丁之间辽阔的地面上，地质部测绘局航空摄影大队展开了空中摄影工作。他们要根据空中摄影的资料填绘这个地区的地质图。空中摄影工作从五月二十号开始，截至六月底，原订拍摄三万平方公里面积的任务已超额完成了。
    在这个大队里，有一个苏联专家队。他们除每天飞行，完成摄影任务之外，还负责将空中摄影技术教给大队所有的中国工作人员。预计到十月底全部工作人员都能熟悉全套航空摄影技术，单独进行操作。
    空中摄影是一个新的工作，它大大提高了绘制地图的工作效率，并且保证质量。人工测量至少需十年才能完成的任务，用航空摄影的方法只需四个多月就行了。这对保证作好地质勘探工作，查明地下矿藏具有很重要的意义。
