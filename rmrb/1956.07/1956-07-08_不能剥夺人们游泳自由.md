    Cannot Deprive People of the Freedom to Swim
    In Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province, there is a Mituo Mountain swimming pool. It not only has a large area and clean water, but also beautiful scenery, making it a good place for swimming. However, this year, a new office building for the Zhejiang Provincial People's Committee was built next to the pool, and the swimming pool is no longer open to the public, but is for the exclusive use of the Provincial People's Committee. The reason given for doing so is to improve security work. We believe this is wrong. Other measures can be taken to strengthen security, but people's freedom to swim should not be deprived.

    不能剥夺人们游泳自由
    浙江省杭州市有一个弥陀山游泳池，那里不但地方大，水清洁，而且风景幽美，是个游泳的好地方，但今年池旁新建了浙江省人民委员会办公大楼，这个游泳池对外就不开放了，让省人民委员会专用。所以要这样做，据说是为了做好保卫工作。我们认为这是不对的，可以采取其他措施加强保卫工作，但不能剥夺人们游泳自由。
