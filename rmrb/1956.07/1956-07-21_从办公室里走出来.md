    Stepping Out of the Office
    By Our Correspondent Shang Kai

    After Ping Shun County, Shanxi Province, achieved complete socialist cooperativization, the 415 primary cooperatives were merged into 184 advanced cooperatives, and the 101 townships were merged into 49 townships, resulting in over eight hundred township and cooperative cadres being detached from production. The leaders of the Ping Shun County Committee of the Communist Party of China had conversations with many township cadres after the merging of townships and cooperatives. In these conversations, they discovered that these cadres no longer had the same concrete understanding of the situation as before. Cadres in Xingcheng Township were even unable to clearly state the production targets of the agricultural cooperatives. Later, several staff members from the county-level organs returned from the countryside and reported similar situations to the County Committee.

    The County Committee felt that the situation was somewhat alarming and immediately dispatched work teams to conduct separate investigations in the townships. The investigations revealed that many township and cooperative cadres were sitting in their offices from morning to night, busy with meetings, accounting, and formulating plans. They were floating above, relaxing their specific leadership of production. Consequently, many agricultural cooperatives experienced serious idleness and waste. For example, the "Five Star" Agricultural Cooperative in Luye Township, with over three hundred laborers, only built seven-tenths of a mu of terraced fields in seventy days, but recorded over one thousand workdays. The situation in Yeyu Township was also poor; with planting season approaching, only 40% of the fertilizer accumulation plan had been completed. At that time, more than fifty agricultural cooperatives throughout the county had failed to complete their fertilizer accumulation plans. The cooperative members were very dissatisfied with this situation, fearing that the production increase plan would fail. They said, "If the cadres only shout slogans but don't lead, how can production be improved?" The township and cooperative cadres, upon hearing these calls, did not raise their vigilance, and still believed that "advanced cooperativization requires putting on a 'socialist air'." Some township governments even hung large signs at their entrances reading "Office Hours Start" and "Office Hours End," presenting a "government office" facade to the masses.

    At the same time, the County Committee's work teams also discovered many township and cooperative cadres who were deeply involved and closely connected with the masses. Li Jinhai, the Party Branch Secretary of Xiwang Township, frequently went into the fields. Before sowing, he discovered that some members of the agricultural cooperatives doubted the county committee's four measures for increasing production based on the characteristics of the mountainous area: intercropping, mixed cropping, replanting, and planting along field edges. They believed that "there will be a lot of trouble, but little increase in production." Li Jinhai went deep into the labor groups and worked with experienced old farmers to study and summarize their years of experience in implementing intercropping, mixed cropping, and planting along field edges, as well as the actual increase in production. They calculated that if these four measures for increasing production were universally implemented throughout the township, each household could eat 213 jin of beans and 20 jin of oil each year, and each person could also eat 120 jin of millet each year. This could change the situation of only eating corn and potatoes year-round. Using these facts, Li Jinhai finally persuaded the members of the agricultural cooperatives and promoted the four measures for increasing production proposed by the county committee.

    Li Jinhai's in-depth and concrete working method was praised by the County Committee at the enlarged cadre meeting of the county. At the same time, the County Committee severely criticized the working style of some township and cooperative cadres who were divorced from reality and the masses, pointing out that if this style continued to develop, the county's 1956 production increase plan would be in danger of failing. It called on all township and cooperative cadres to learn from Li Jinhai's example, immediately step out of the office, go deep down, and specifically lead production. To effectively help township and cooperative cadres change their style, the County Committee also organized many work teams, led by the county's leading cadres, to lead all township and cooperative cadres into the fields. This approach achieved good results. After stepping out of the office, the cadres of Miaozhuang Township discovered that the "Patriotic" Agricultural Cooperative had originally planned to apply 100 dan of fertilizer per mu, but had only completed 45 dan; furthermore, they were short 800 jin of "Golden Queen" corn seeds. The cadres of Yangwei Township used to rely on sitting in their offices, listening to reports, and giving guidance; after going deep down this time, they discovered that the "Red Star" Agricultural Cooperative's report of having accumulated 120 dan of fertilizer was untrue. In reality, they had only completed 80 dan, and the quality was not high... Big and small problems, like basins of cold water, poured one after another, instantly sobering the minds of the township and cooperative cadres. They said: If we don't step out of the office, we won't know even if the sky is falling outside, how dangerous!

    Township and cooperative cadres stepped out of the office. However, in today's new situation of large townships and large cooperatives, how can concrete leadership be achieved? This problem has not yet been solved. Many township and cooperative cadres felt overwhelmed with problems after stepping out of the office, not knowing where to start, and then running around aimlessly. The situation in Zhongwujing Township was like this. Zhongwujing Township includes nine natural villages, seven agricultural cooperatives, and 1,400 households, distributed in a ravine eighteen li long and wide. Branch Secretary Wu Shuiqing had to run to Tuoshan, Beitou, and Longyugou every day, and Township Head Liu Jingxin had to go to Liucun, Xisai, and other villages every day. They ran around in such a hurry that no problem could be completely solved. At this time, the County Committee's work team assisted the cadres of Zhongwujing Township in studying the situation together and prioritizing problems based on their severity and urgency for sequential resolution. At that time, the most serious problem in the entire township was the shortage of more than 108,000 dan of fertilizer with spring plowing and planting imminent. With the help of the work team, the township cadres learned from the fertilizer accumulation experience of Yangjingdi Township, and the township cadres divided their responsibilities and contracted to the cooperatives, leading the cooperative members to carry out a fertilizer accumulation campaign together. In just one and a half days, more than 98,000 dan of fertilizer was accumulated. After solving the fertilizer problem, the township cadres divided their responsibilities again, summarized and promoted the experience of two production groups in Longyugou Village in repairing terraced fields, enabling the entire township to repair more than 1,000 mu of land in ten days. Then, they summarized and promoted the experience of Guo Xinke of Zhongwujing Village in raising livestock, changing the chaotic situation in livestock breeding and management throughout the township. At the same time, Township Head Liu Jingxin convened a forum of old farmers to study and summarize the technical problems of spring plowing and sowing to ensure the quality of sowing throughout the township. Many production problems in Zhongwujing Township were solved one by one in this way.

    After spring plowing and sowing ended, the County Committee then organized work teams to go deep into various townships to check the quality of sowing. From the process of checking the quality of sowing, they continued to help township and cooperative cadres improve their working methods and work style. For example, the cadres of Xigou and Chuandi Townships did not conduct a good inspection after sowing, and subjectively believed that the autumn seedlings were growing "very well" this year, and even if there were a few missing seedlings, it was a "small matter". In order to help them recognize the harm of this blindly optimistic attitude, the County Committee's work team carefully inspected the autumn fields with them. As a result, it was found that two-thirds of the cornfields in Jinxing Cooperative were missing 30 to 100 seedlings per mu, and the most were missing more than 200 to 300 seedlings. The seedling shortage phenomenon in Wuyi Cooperative of Chuandi Township was also very serious. Preliminary estimates showed that the entire cooperative would reduce its grain yield by more than 20,000 jin due to the seedling shortage. These facts greatly surprised and sobered the cadres of Xigou and Chuandi Townships. They went deep down separately and led the masses to carry out seedling inspection and replanting work, finally reaching the standard of full and vigorous seedlings.

    The leading cadres of Ping Shun County led work teams to the townships to specifically help township and cooperative cadres in their work, not only helping them to change their work style, making them feel that their eyes were bright and they had solutions, but also making the masses feel that they had leadership and support, thereby strengthening the relationship between cadres and the masses. As many members of agricultural cooperatives said: In the past, we avoided the cadres and were afraid of them coming because they only held meetings and stayed up late without solving problems; now we think about the cadres and look forward to them coming because they help with work and solve problems.

    从办公室里走出来
    本报记者　商恺
    山西省平顺县实现了完全社会主义合作化以后，由415个初级社合并为184个高级社，由101个乡合并为49个乡，脱离生产的乡干部和社干部有八百多人。中共平顺县委的领导人员，在并乡并社以后曾和许多乡干部谈过话；在谈话中发现，他们不像从前那样具体了解情况了。杏城乡的干部，连农业社的生产指标都说不清楚。后来，县级机关的几个工作人员从乡下回来，也向县委汇报了类似的情况。
    县委感到情况有些不妙，马上派遣工作组分头下乡进行考察。在考察中发现许多乡、社干部天天从早到晚坐在办公室里忙着开会、算账、制定规划，浮在上面，放松了对生产的具体领导。因此，不少农业社窝工和浪费现象很严重。如芦芽乡“五星”农业社，三百多个劳动力，七十天中只修了七分梯田，劳动日却记了一千多个。野峪乡的情况也不佳，眼看到了下种的时候，积肥计划才完成40％。当时从全县来看，没有完成积肥计划的，就有五十多个农业社。社员群众对这种情况很不满意，担心增产计划会落空。他们说：“干部空喊不领导，生产怎么能搞好？”乡干部和社干部听到了这些呼声，并没有提高警惕，仍然认为“高级合作化了，应该摆出个‘社会主义的派头’来。”有的乡公所的门口，挂上了“上办公”（办公时间）“下办公”（停止办公）的大牌子，对群众摆出了一副“机关衙门”的面孔。
    同时，县委工作组也发现了不少具体深入、密切联系群众的乡干部和社干部。西湾乡党支部书记李金海，经常深入田间，在播种前发现有些农业社的社员对县委根据山区特点提出的套种、间作、复播、种边岸等四项增产措施表示怀疑，认为“麻烦不少，增产不大”。李金海便深入劳动小组，同种地有经验的老农共同研究，总结了他们多年来实行间作、套种、种边岸的经验和实际的增产效果。他们推算出来：如果在全乡普遍推行这四项增产措施，每户每年可以吃到豆子二百一十三斤、油二十斤，每人每年还可吃到小米一百二十斤。这就可以改变那种常年光吃玉米、山药蛋的情况。李金海运用这些事实，终于说服了农业社的社员，推行了县委所提出的四项增产措施。
    李金海这种深入具体的工作方法，在全县扩大干部会议上，受到了县委的表扬。同时县委严厉批评了某些乡干部社干部脱离实际、脱离群众的工作作风，指出如果让这种作风继续发展下去，全县1956年的增产计划就有落空的危险；号召全体乡干部和社干部，学习李金海的榜样，立刻走出办公室，深入下去，具体地领导生产。为了切实帮助乡、社干部改变作风，县委又以县的领导干部为首组织了许多工作组，分头带领全体乡、社干部深入到田间去。这种作法，收到了良好的效果。苗庄乡乡干部在走出办公室以后，便发现“爱国”农业社原计划每亩施肥一百担，才完成了四十五担；金皇后玉米种子还缺八百斤。扬威乡的干部，平日靠坐在办公室里听汇报指导工作；这次深入下去以后，才发现“红星”农业社向他们汇报的已积肥一百二十担的情况不真实，实际上只完成了八十担，而且质量不高。……大大小小的问题，像一盆一盆的凉水接二连三地迎面泼来，使乡干部和社干部的头脑顿时清醒了。他们说：再不走出办公室来，外边塌下天来也不知道，多末危险啊！
    乡、社干部从办公室里走出来了。但是，在今天乡大社大的新形势下，怎样才能实现具体领导？这问题还没有解决。有许多乡干部和社干部走出办公室以后，感到问题很多，茫无头绪，不知如何下手，又发生了乱跑腿的现象。中五井乡的情况便是如此。中五井乡包括九个自然村，七个农业社，一千四百户，分布在一条纵横十八里长的山沟里。支部书记吴水清每天要到驮山、北头、龙峪沟跑一趟，乡长刘景新每天也要到留村、西赛等村转一遭。他们就这样匆匆忙忙地跑来跑去，什么问题也不能彻底解决。这时候，县委工作组便援助中五井乡的干部，共同研究情况，根据问题的轻重缓急排队依次解决。当时全乡最严重的问题是眼看就要春耕下种了，还缺肥料十万八千多担。乡干部在工作组的帮助下，学习了羊井底乡的积肥经验，由乡干部分工包干，深入到社，和社干部一起领导社员开展了积肥运动。仅仅用了一天半的时间，便积肥九万八千多担。在解决肥料问题以后，乡干部又分工负责，总结和推广了龙峪沟村两个生产小组整修梯田的经验，使全乡在十天中整修了土地一千多亩。接着，又总结和推广了中五井村郭新科饲养牲畜的经验，改变了全乡在牲畜饲养管理方面的混乱情况。与此同时，乡长刘景新召开了老农座谈会，研究总结春耕播种的技术问题，保证了全乡的播种质量。中五井乡生产上的许多问题，就这样一个一个解决了。
    春耕播种结束以后，紧接着，县委又组织了工作组深入各乡检查播种质量。从检查播种质量的过程中，继续帮助乡干部和社干部改进工作方法和工作作风。比如西沟和川底两个乡的干部，在播种以后，没有很好地进行检查，便主观地认为今年秋苗出得“很好”，即使缺几株苗也是“小事情”。县委工作组为了帮助他们认识这种盲目乐观情绪的害处，便和他们一起对秋田仔细地进行了检查。结果，发现金星社有三分之二的玉米地每亩缺苗三十株到一百株，最多的缺到二百株到三百株以上。川底乡五一社的缺苗现象也很严重，初步估算了一下，全社将因缺苗而减产两万斤以上的粮食。这些事实，使西沟和川底两乡的干部大吃一惊，清醒过来，分头深入下去，领导群众开展了查苗补苗工作，终于达到了苗全苗旺的标准。
    平顺县领导干部带领工作组下乡，具体帮助乡干部和社干部工作，不仅帮助他们转变了作风，使他们觉得眼睛亮了，有了办法，而且使群众觉得有了领导，有了依靠，密切了干部和群众的关系。正如许多农业社社员所说的：过去是躲干部，怕他们来，因为他们来了光开会熬夜，不解决问题；现在是想干部，盼他们来，因为他们来了又帮助干活，又解决问题。
