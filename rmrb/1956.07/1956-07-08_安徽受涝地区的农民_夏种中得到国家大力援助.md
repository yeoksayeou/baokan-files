Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, July 7th: Farmers in the flood-stricken areas along the Huai River in Anhui Province have received tremendous assistance from the state for their summer planting. Today, a Xinhua News Agency reporter learned from the Anhui Provincial Agricultural Department that over 29 million jin of high-yield crop seeds such as corn and late rice, and over 13 million jin of chemical fertilizers, have already been transported to the flood-stricken rural areas along the Huai River; over 7 million yuan in loans for drainage and replanting have also been fully distributed to agricultural production cooperatives and farmers. Currently, another 7.35 million jin of chemical fertilizers and 5 million yuan in loans are being rushed for transport and distribution.

After the flooding in the Huai River area of Anhui Province, farmers, in order to make up for their losses and strive to complete the annual production increase plan, further expanded high-yield crops and increased the multiple cropping area during the summer planting season. In addition, some early autumn crops needed to be replanted and fertilized due to the flooding, which created a shortage of fertilizer and seeds. To help farmers overcome difficulties and complete the production increase plan, after the flood disaster occurred, the relevant departments in Anhui Province quickly transported the province's inventory of seeds and fertilizers to the disaster areas and sent a large number of cadres to Shandong, Hebei, Henan and other provinces to urgently transfer seeds, and obtained the active support of the above provinces. Therefore, the seeds and fertilizers needed by the farmers in the flood area were delivered in the shortest possible time.

With the strong assistance of the state, the farmers along the Huai River are seizing the season, working day and night to rush the planting and topdressing. At present, the farmers along the Huai River have completed more than 60% of the summer planting plan, of which the area of ​​high-yield crops and intercropping and relay cropping has reached half.

    安徽受涝地区的农民
    夏种中得到国家大力援助
    新华社合肥7日电　安徽省沿淮受涝地区农民的夏种得到国家的巨大援助。今天新华社记者从安徽省农业部门获悉：两千九百多万斤玉米、晚稻等高产作物种子和一千三百多万斤化学肥料，都已经运到沿淮受涝农村；七百多万元的排涝补种贷款也已经全部发到农业生产合作社和农民手中。现在还有735万斤化学肥料和五百万元贷款正在赶运和发放中。
    安徽省沿淮地区受涝后，农民为弥补损失，争取完成全年增产计划，就在夏种中进一步扩大高产作物和增加复种面积，再加部分早秋作物受涝需要重新补种和加工施肥，这样就产生了缺乏肥料、种子的困难。为帮助农民克服困难，完成增产计划，在涝灾发生后，安徽省的有关部门就迅速把省内库存的种子、肥料向灾区赶运，并派出大批干部分赴山东、河北、河南等省紧急调运种子，并获得上述各省的积极支援，所以涝区农民所需的种子、肥料在最短期间就运到了。
    沿淮农民在国家的大力援助下，抓紧季节，日夜突击抢种和追肥，现沿淮农民已完成夏种计划的60％以上，其中改种高产作物和间种、套种的面积已达一半。
