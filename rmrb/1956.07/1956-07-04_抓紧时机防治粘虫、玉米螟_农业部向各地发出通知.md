    Ministry of Agriculture Issues Notice to Various Regions
    (Our Dispatch) The Ministry of Agriculture of the People's Republic of China issued a notice to various regions on June 30th, urging them to seize the opportunity to eliminate and control armyworms and corn borers.

    The notice pointed out: Currently, armyworms and corn borers are occurring in many areas. Judging from pest reports from thirteen provinces and cities including Jilin, Heilongjiang, and Tianjin, the number of armyworm moths and corn borer moths this year is very large. In Helong County, Jilin Province, each light trap attracts 130 moths per day, and in Mudanjiang, Heilongjiang, each light trap attracts 300 moths per day. Shandong, Jiangsu, Anhui and other provinces have discovered a large number of corn borer moths laying eggs. In many areas of Hebei Province, the first generation of corn borer larvae have been found. This year, armyworms and corn borers are also quite severe in some areas. According to a survey by the Northeast Academy of Agricultural Sciences in Gongzhuling City, in areas severely affected by armyworms, there are generally 100 to 200 worms per square meter (in densely planted wheat fields). According to another survey, armyworm larvae have also occurred in Jiangsu, Shandong, Hubei and other provinces, and some areas have already been affected. The notice requires rural work leading departments at all levels to attach importance to the work of preventing and controlling armyworms and corn borers this year, conduct in-depth inspections and supervision, do a good job in pest forecasting, appropriately allocate pesticides and machinery, organize forces, seize the opportunity, and effectively achieve early control and elimination. The notice also briefly introduced methods for preventing and controlling these two pests.
