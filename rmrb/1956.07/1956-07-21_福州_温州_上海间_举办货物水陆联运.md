Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, 19th. Water-land intermodal transport of goods between Fuzhou, Wenzhou, and Shanghai began on the 16th. The first batch of several hundred tons of Fujian tea has already been transported by land from the production area of Fuan to Wenzhou, and then by sea from Wenzhou to Shanghai. General merchandise, cotton cloth, and building materials produced in Shanghai, Zhejiang, and other places have also begun to be consigned to Fujian.

The opening of water-land intermodal transport can accelerate the circulation of some import and export materials in Fujian Province, and the sea transportation costs through Shanghai and Wenzhou are also low.

    举办货物水陆联运
    新华社福州19日电　福州—温州—上海间从十六日起开始举办货物水陆联运。第一批几百吨福建茶叶已经由产地福安陆运温州，再由温州海运到上海。上海、浙江等地出产的百货、纱布、建筑器材也已经开始托运福建。
    水陆联运的开办，可以加速福建省部分进出物资的流转，而且通过上海、温州海运成本低廉。
