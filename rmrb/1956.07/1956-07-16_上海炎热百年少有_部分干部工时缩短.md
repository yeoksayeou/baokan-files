    Shanghai Heat Wave Unprecedented in a Century
    Some Cadres' Working Hours Shortened
    (Our newspaper's Shanghai dispatch, 15th) For the past half-month, the outdoor temperature in Shanghai has consistently been above 100 degrees Fahrenheit, an unprecedented heat wave in a century. The Municipal People's Committee has issued a special notice to care for the health of weak and pregnant female staff members. The notice states: Due to the hot weather, in order to care for the health of weak staff members and pregnant female staff members, it is now stipulated that these personnel may arrive at the office half an hour to one hour later than the prescribed office hours each morning, or take a pedicab to the office. The difference between all pedicab fares and public transport fares can be paid by each department under the item of transportation subsidies.
