　　Rich Mineral Deposits Bordering Our Country

　　Soviet geologists have explored the Ertis (Irtysh) fractured zone in the Altai region. This zone extends for 500 kilometers within the Soviet Union, with the remaining portion in China. In some areas, the zone is 30 kilometers wide. Soviet geologists previously estimated that non-ferrous metals were extremely abundant there. Exploration has revealed several enormous polymetallic deposits. One of these, the Novo-Berezovsky deposit, lies beneath 60 kilometers of soil. Another deposit is located below the Belousov mine.

　　Exploration of the Nikolaev copper mine in eastern Kazakhstan has been completed. It is rich in copper, zinc, and lead, as well as arsenic, iron, gold, silver, antimony, and other rare metals. Sulfur alone amounts to millions of tons. One of the largest copper mines in the Soviet Union will be established there.

　　Jet Civil Aviation Line in Preparation

　　The Soviet Union is actively preparing to use the "Tu-104" jet airliner on the Moscow to Irkutsk route. On the 17th, one of these jet airliners flew from Moscow to Irkutsk, and on the 18th, it returned from there. According to Soviet journalists interviewed on board, the flight results were good. The plane took to the sky in one to one and a half minutes, and the plane proceeded at a speed of 830 kilometers per hour, but the passengers did not feel the speed. Outside the plane windows was a boundless expanse of clean blue sky, with clouds far below. This is because the plane was flying at an altitude of 10,000 meters. The outside temperature was minus 53 degrees Celsius, but inside the cabin it was very warm. The plane moved smoothly, without jolting, and without giving people the uncomfortable feeling of suddenly falling, as if driving on a flat road. More than fifty passengers chatted, read, and played chess in a lively and comfortable manner. The plane landed once in Omsk en route. The plane began to descend 250 to 270 kilometers from the airport, and the passengers barely noticed it. The 4,500 kilometers from Moscow to Irkutsk were flown in only five hours and fifty minutes, whereas ordinary planes take thirteen to fourteen hours.

　　Increasing Travel

　　In the summer, Moscow attracts many foreign tourists. The number of travelers from the West is increasing day by day. Hotels are often fully booked. At noon on the 17th, a large group of people with bags and cameras arrived at the Kiev Railway Station. They were more than three hundred French people who had landed via Odessa, and they were welcomed by Muscovites. Half of the French tourists remained on board, traveling along the Black Sea.

　　A group of Soviet travelers departed from Kamchatka on the ship "Asia" to Korea and China. Among the travelers were welders, fitters, and female teachers. This group of travelers will visit Pyongyang and other Korean cities, and then visit scenic spots, museums, theaters, factories, and construction sites in Beijing and Shenyang. Soon, a second group of travelers will depart along the same route.

　　Three-Wheeled Car

　　A peculiar three-wheeled, two-seater car has recently appeared on the streets of Moscow, arousing great interest among Muscovites.

　　This small car, called "Baby," surpasses similar small cars from other countries in many respects. It is beautifully styled and very simple in structure. It weighs only 170 kilograms, slightly more than a motorcycle, and two people can lift it.

　　This small car has a top speed of 90 kilometers per hour and is very stable to drive. It will not shake even when turning at high speed. The exposed engine in the front of the car is easily cooled by the oncoming airflow, unlike most cars in other countries, which require ventilators and complex coolers to cool the engine cylinders.　(Xinhua News Agency)

    在苏联
    同我国接壤的丰富矿藏
    苏联地质学家勘探了阿尔泰边疆的额尔齐斯扭曲地带。这个地带有五百公里在苏联境内，其他部分在中国境内。这个地带有些地方宽三十公里。苏联地质学家曾经估计那里有色金属非常丰富，勘探结果发现了好些巨大的多种金属矿床。其中一个诺伏别列佐夫矿床埋藏在六十公里土层下面。另一个矿床埋藏在别洛乌索夫矿井下面。
    哈萨克斯坦东部尼古拉也夫铜矿的勘探已经结束。那里富有铜、锌和铅，也有砷、铁、金、银、锑和其他稀有金属，仅仅硫就有几百万吨。在那里将建立苏联最大的铜矿之一。
    喷气机民航线在准备中
    苏联积极准备在莫斯科到伊尔库次克的航线上使用“Ty—04”式喷气民航机。十七日有一架这种喷气民航机由莫斯科飞到伊尔库次克，十八日从那里回来。据随机采访的苏联记者报道，飞行的结果良好。在一分到一分半钟间飞机腾上天空，飞机以一小时八百三十公里的速度前进，但是乘客不觉得快。在机窗外是无边的洁净的蓝天，云彩留在下面远处。因为飞机飞在一万公尺高空。舱外温度零下五十三度，而舱内很暖和。飞机平稳地前进着，不颠簸，不给人忽然跌落的难过感觉，好像驶在平坦的公路上。五十多位乘客活跃自在地谈心，看书下棋。飞机在中途鄂木斯克着陆一次。飞机在离机场二百五十到二百七十公里远开始降落，乘客不大觉得。从莫斯科到伊尔库次克四千五百公里只飞行了五小时五十分，而平常飞机要飞行十三四小时。
    旅行往来越来越多
    在夏天里，莫斯科吸引着众多的外国游客。从西方来的旅行者一天比一天多起来。旅馆常常客满。十七日中午基辅车站到了大批拿着提包、挂着照相机的人们。他们是经过敖德萨登陆的三百多个法国人，他们受到莫斯科人的欢迎。还有半数法国人留在船上沿着黑海旅行。
    一批苏联旅行者乘着“亚细亚”号轮船从堪察加出发到朝鲜和中国去。旅行者中有电焊工、钳工、女教员等。这批旅行者将访问平壤和其他朝鲜城市，然后到北京和沈阳参观名胜古迹、博物馆、戏院、工厂、工地。很快将有第二批旅行者顺着同一路线出发。
              （本报莫斯科电）
    三轮小汽车
    莫斯科街头最近出现了一种奇特的三轮双座小汽车，引起了莫斯科人很大的兴趣。
    这种被称为“婴儿”的小汽车，在许多指标方面都超过别的国家同类小汽车。它的式样美观，结构非常简单。它只有一百七十公斤重，比摩托车稍微重一点，两个人就可以把它抬起来。
    这种小汽车的时速达九十公里，行驶起来非常平稳，用很快的速度转弯也不会发生震荡。装在汽车前面的敞开的发动机，很容易在迎面来的气流中冷却，不像别国的大多数汽车那样要装通风器和复杂的冷却器来冷却发动机的汽缸。　（新华社）
