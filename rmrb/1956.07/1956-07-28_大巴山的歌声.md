After the Baoji-Chengdu Railway leaves the Chengdu Plain in western Sichuan, it hugs the precipitous cliffs of the Daba Mountains, ascending along the surging Jialing River straight to Baoji in the Qinling Mountains. In this sparsely populated area of over 400 kilometers, railway workers have built their homes, leveled high mountains, and filled deep ravines, instantly bringing life to this desolate mountain region that had been barren for generations.

Due to the inconvenient transportation and poor supply conditions in the mountainous area, everyone had to squat at home chatting during rest periods. Some felt so bored that they went climbing mountains, but how could one always relieve boredom by climbing mountains all day long! The workers organized an amateur entertainment team. Whenever they stopped work to rest, they would beat gongs, drums, and perform the Yangko dance. After a while, everyone felt a bit bored again. Some people used waste bamboo tubes, bamboo shoots, and other materials to make simple single-stringed instruments; some drilled small holes in bamboo to make flutes; some wrapped tinfoil on combs and used them as instruments. In this way, without spending a penny, they formed a "local instrument group."

Later, the trade union bought erhus, sanxians, moon lutes, violins, and accordions. New instruments were bought, but most of the workers didn't know how to use them. If they didn't know, they learned; if there was no one to teach, they explored on their own. In less than two months, more than forty active members of the Mixed Fifteenth Detachment's entertainment activities could all play, sing, and perform.

The singing in the Daba Mountains never ceases. They closely integrate with production and central work, carrying out diverse and varied activities.

The farmers living in the Daba Mountains rarely had the chance to see plays and dances due to inconvenient transportation. Therefore, railway workers invited them to participate in every performance. Old farmer Ren, who lives near the Mixed Fifteenth Detachment, is already seventy-six years old this year. When the workers first came to this area, they had to pass by the edge of his field when going to and from work, and he was always a bit unhappy because he was afraid that the workers would trample the seedlings. Later, he often attended evening parties. After watching the opera "On the Jialing River," the next day he led his granddaughter to repair the road workers took to work, making it smooth and wide. He also specially set aside several plots of land for the workers to grow vegetables.

In the evening, hundreds and thousands of people flock to the theater. The girls of the 060 Women's Team are here to participate in the performance; white-haired old men are here with their grandchildren to watch the performance. The workers who have worked hard for a week are all gathered in the theater, enjoying a happy weekend.

    大巴山的歌声
    林尚　马华
    宝成铁路出川西平原后，就倚着悬崖绝壁的大巴山，沿着波涛汹涌的嘉陵江而上，直达宝鸡秦岭。在这四百多公里人烟稀少的地区里，铁路工人建立了自己的家园，削平了高山，填满了深壑，使得这世世代代荒凉的山区，顿然热闹起来。
    山区交通不便，物资供应条件差，逢到休息时间，大家只好蹲在家里聊天，有的闷得发慌，就跑去爬山，但一天到晚那能老拿爬山解闷呢！工人们组织了一支业余文娱队。一停工休息，就打起锣鼓扭秧歌。日子一久，大家又有些乏味了。有人用废竹筒、笋壳等东西，做成了简单的单弦琴，有用竹子挖了些小孔做成笛子，有人把锡泊纸包在梳子上，也当作乐器。就这样，一钱未花，就组成了一个“土乐器组”了。
    后来，工会又购买了南胡、三弦、月琴、提琴、手风琴。新式乐器买来了，但工人们大多不会使用。不会，就学，没有人教，就自己来摸索。还不到两个月的时间，混合十五中队四十多个文娱活动的积极分子，都能拉能弹，能唱会演了。
    大巴山区的歌声是不息的。他们紧密结合生产和中心工作，开展了多式多样的活动。
    住在大巴山区的农民，由于交通不便，很难得看见演剧跳舞，因此铁路工人每次演出，都要邀请他们来参加。住在混合十五中队附近的老农民任大爷，今年已经七十六岁了，起初工人才到这一带来时，上下工都要经过他的地边，他怕工人踏了禾苗，总是有些不高兴。后来他经常参加晚会，看了歌剧“嘉陵江上”后，第二天就带领了孙女，把工人上工的路，修得平平宽宽的，还专门抽了几块地，给工人种小菜。
    傍晚，成百上千的人拥向剧场。零六零女工中队的姑娘们来了，她们是来参加演出的；白发苍苍的老汉，携着孙儿来了，他们是来看演出的。辛勤劳动了一周的工人们，都聚集在剧场，欢度着愉快的周末。
