    In the Soviet Union

    150,000 Young People Go to New Lands to Help with Harvesting
    Every day, thousands upon thousands of young men and women from all over the Soviet Union are arriving in the vast rural areas of Siberia and Kazakhstan. They are responding to the call of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League to help collective farms and state farms harvest the abundant crops. The two thousand young men and women from Leningrad arrived in Pavlodarsk on July 19th. Ten thousand young workers and students from various cities in Kazakhstan have already begun working in the fields. These days, young men and women from all over the country can be seen on the railway lines. According to incomplete statistics, 150,000 young people have now arrived in Siberia and Kazakhstan to help harvest crops.

    Mechanized Iron Shovel
    Soviet engineer Cheglovsky recently created a mechanized iron shovel. When installed on the front of a C-80 tractor, it can be operated freely to unload stones and sand from open wagons. This iron shovel is operated by the tractor's machinery. The lower chord of the shovel is equipped with a slot that can be automatically opened and closed. After loading stones and sand, the slot automatically closes and then moves away. The adoption of this iron shovel completely changes the long-standing method of manually unloading stones and sand from open wagons, improving unloading efficiency. Previously, it took twenty-five workers twelve hours to unload six thousand tons of stones and sand from forty train cars. After using the mechanized iron shovel, it only takes six workers four hours to unload everything.

    New Horizon for Television
    In a scientific research institution in Leningrad, experiments are being conducted to apply television to the scheduling of water and land transportation. In the near future, dispatchers or duty officers at stations or junctions will have electric tuning machines installed in their offices. At that time, as long as a switch is flipped, the scene that can usually only be seen on site will appear on the television screen: intersecting railway tracks, carriages, liaison officers and inspectors at work, and the progress of loading and unloading. All of this is accurately and clearly displayed in front of the dispatchers and duty officers.

    Now, regardless of the weather or time of day, car number clerks walk along the long rows of carriages, recording the car numbers, and then use a small transmitter to send the verified car numbers. Before long, these car number clerks will be able to work in front of the television in the studio.

    Similarly, port dispatchers can also use the television screen to grasp the situation of ship loading and unloading and the mechanical work of the port.

    在苏联
    十五万青年到新地帮助收割
    天天都有成千成百的青年男女，从苏联各地来到西伯利亚和哈萨克斯坦的广大农村，他们是响应共青团中央的号召到那里帮助集体农庄和国营农场收割丰收的庄稼的。从列宁格勒去的两千青年男女已经在七月十九日到达巴夫诺达尔斯克。从哈萨克斯坦各城市下乡的一万个青年职工和学生已经开始在田地上工作。这些日子以来，在铁路线上每天可以看到从全国各地去的青年男女。据不完全统计，现在到达西伯利亚和哈萨克斯坦帮助收割庄稼的青年已有十五万名。
    机械化的铁铲
    苏联工程师车格洛夫斯基最近创造了一种机械化的铁铲，把它安装在C八○式拖拉机前端，可以操纵自如地卸下敞车上的石块与沙土。这种铁铲是依靠拖拉机的机械来操纵的。铁铲的下弦，装着一个能自动开闭的槽子，装上石块沙土后，槽子自动紧闭，然后开走。这种铁铲的被采用，彻底地改变了长期以来用手工从敞车上卸石块沙土的方法，提高卸运效力。以前四十个火车厢上六千吨的石块沙土，需要二十五个工人在十二个小时之内才能卸完，改用了机械化铁铲之后，只需六个工人在四小时之内就能全部卸完。
    电视的新天地
    在列宁格勒的一个科学研究机关，正在实验把电视应用到调度水陆运输的工作上去。不久的将来，在车站或岔道口的调度员或值班长的工作室内就要安装电调机，那时只要一拨开关，电视机的银幕上就出现平常只有在现场才能看到的情景：交叉的铁路路轨、车厢、联络员和检车员在工作、装货和卸货的进行情况。这一切都准确地和清晰地展现在调度员和值班长的眼前。
    现在，无论天气好坏、无论白天黑夜，车号员沿着长列的车厢一边走一边把车号记录下来，然后用小发报机把这些查验过的车号发走。不要太久，这些车号员就可以在工作室的电视机前工作了。
    同样，港口的调度员也只要通过电视机的银幕，就能掌握船只装卸货物和港口机械化工作的情况。
