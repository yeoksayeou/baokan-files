    Our Country Manufactures a New Type of Fishing Vessel
    (By Our Staff Reporter) Our country has recently successfully trial-produced a new type of fishing vessel. This is a 300-horsepower side trawler, 39.15 meters in length and with a displacement of 450 tons. Each voyage can catch a maximum of over 110 tons of fish. Equipped with ice-breaking equipment, it can also navigate in climates as cold as minus 40 degrees Celsius.
    Many of the devices on this fishing vessel are electric. For example, the echo sounder can use radio waves to detect fish shoals. Radio direction finders, electric rangefinders, and full-wave transceivers can maintain contact inside and outside the fishing vessel at the fastest speed. The electric snow sweeper on the driver's cab doors and windows prevents rain and snow from staying on the doors and windows for even a moment. The fishing equipment includes a trawl for catching bottom fish and a drift net for catching surface fish, both of which are also electric. At the stern of the fishing vessel, there is also a fish liver oil rendering room, where the sailors can refine fish liver into fish liver oil while fishing.
    This beautiful and exquisite fishing vessel also provides a safe and comfortable living environment for the crew. The room partition walls have one-foot-thick cork insulation, so the sailors will not suffer in severe cold weather; the restaurant is equipped with wave-proof tables, so the crew can dine peacefully even in rough seas. On the deck, there are also swivel armchairs.
    This fishing vessel is the first fishing vessel manufactured by our country for the Soviet Union. The Soviet Import and Export Corporation named it "Shouchuang (Pioneer) ". (Zhou Huimin, Zhou Shuzhen)

    我国制成一艘新型渔轮
    本报讯　我国最近试制成功了一艘新型的渔轮。这是一艘三百马力舷拖网渔轮，全长三十九点一五公尺，排水量四百五十吨，每次出海最多时可捕鱼一百一十多吨。由于装有破冰设备，在零下四十度（摄氏）气候里还可以航行。
    这艘渔轮上有许多设备是电动的。如音响测深仪能够用电波来探测鱼群区。无线电定向计、电动测程仪，以及全波收发机等设备，能以最快的速度保持渔轮内外的联系。驾驶室门窗上的电动扫雪机，使雨雪在门窗上片刻也不能停留。捕鱼设备有专捕底层鱼的拖网机和捕上层鱼的漂网，也都是电动的。渔轮尾部还有一个鱼肝油熬油室，海员们一边捕鱼，一边就可以把鱼肝炼成鱼肝油。
    这艘美丽而精致的渔轮，还为船员们安排了一个安全舒适的生活环境。房间板壁上有一尺厚的软木隔热设备，在严寒天气海员们也不会吃苦；餐厅里准备着有防浪设备的餐桌，船员们在大风浪里也能安宁地进餐。甲板上，还钉有可以转动的安乐椅。
    这艘渔轮是我国为苏联制造的第一艘渔轮。苏联进出口公司把它命名为“首创号”。（周惠民、周淑珍）
