    Craftsmen's Income Decreased

    After the handicrafts cooperatives were established in some counties of Baoding Special District, Hebei Province, the income of cooperative members generally decreased somewhat. The reasons are: extravagance and waste, such as the Dingxing County Construction Cooperative spending 1,136 yuan on tearing down old houses to build new ones and adding non-productive equipment in order to show off; excessive extraction of public accumulation funds, such as the wages of the members of the Wangdu County Chengguan Service Cooperative only accounting for 47.4% of the total processing income; blindly establishing large cooperatives, reducing the number of retail outlets, causing inconvenience to the masses, and also reducing income.

    The decrease in the income of cooperative members affects the consolidation of handicrafts cooperatives. The Hebei Provincial Handicrafts Department should take effective measures to correct this.

    手工业者的收入减少了
    河北省保定专区部分县手工业合作化以后，社员收入普遍下降了一些。原因是：铺张浪费，如定兴县建筑社为了摆阔气，拆旧房盖新屋，添置非生产设备等共花去1，136元；提取公积金过多，如望都县城关服务社社员工资只占全部加工收入的47.4％；盲目办大社，减少了门市部，使群众感到不便，也减少了收入。
    社员收入减少，影响手工业合作社的巩固，河北省手工业主管部门应该采取有效措施加以纠正。
