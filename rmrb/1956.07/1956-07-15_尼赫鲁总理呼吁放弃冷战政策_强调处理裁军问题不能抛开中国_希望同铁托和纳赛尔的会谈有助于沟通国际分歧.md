Xinhua News Agency, July 14th: London Dispatch: Indian Prime Minister Nehru told reporters at London Airport on the 13th, before leaving Britain for West Germany, that in the current world situation, it is particularly important that "we must abandon the Cold War approach. This approach is not suitable for modern conditions, and if you abandon the hot war approach, then the Cold War is useless."

He said, secondly, "It is very important that the People's Government of China must be represented in the United Nations. Otherwise, all issues in the Far East cannot be properly addressed." He added that, in his view, if disarmament issues are to be addressed, it is clear that "you cannot ignore one of the most powerful countries in the world (referring to China)."

A reporter asked: "At the press conference you held in London last week, you didn't like to use the word 'neutral' to explain your country's foreign policy. Would you like to give a final definition?" Nehru replied that India's policy is "an active and independent policy adopted by a country that intends to be friends with all countries and not hostile to any country."

When asked if his upcoming talks with Tito and Gamal Abdel Nasser would help bridge the divisions in the world political situation, Nehru said that he hoped everything they did would help bridge the divisions, but "we don't have any specific goals in mind, just to understand the general situation."

Referring to the Cyprus issue, Nehru said that there was no question of India supporting the British government on this issue. "We will independently judge the situation based on the facts." He added that the Cyprus issue is a very complex one. On the one hand, India is clearly in favor of freedom and against violence. But this issue is very difficult, and it is quite reckless to make suggestions casually.

Nehru said, referring to the talks held in London with other Commonwealth Prime Ministers, that the most beneficial part was "the talks we all had together."

    尼赫鲁总理呼吁放弃冷战政策
    强调处理裁军问题不能抛开中国
    希望同铁托和纳赛尔的会谈有助于沟通国际分歧
    新华社14日讯　伦敦消息：印度总理尼赫鲁十三日在离开英国去西德以前在伦敦机场上向记者说：在目前世界局势下，特别重要的一点是，“我们必须放弃冷战的办法。这种办法是不适合现代的情况的，如果你放弃了热战的办法，那末冷战就没有用处的了。”
    他说，其次，“十分重要的是：中国的人民政府必须有代表参加联合国。不然的话，远东的一切问题就无法获得适当的处理。”他又说，在他看来，如果要处理裁军问题的话，显然“你不能抛开世界上最强大的国家之一（指中国）”。
    有记者问：“你上周在伦敦举行的记者招待会上不喜欢用中立这个字眼来解释你的国家的外交政策，你愿意下一个最后的定义吗？”尼赫鲁回答说，印度的政策是“一个打算同所有国家做朋友而不敌视任何国家的国家所采取的积极的、独立的政策”。
    有记者问到，即将举行的他同铁托和阿卜杜勒·纳赛尔的会谈是否有助于沟通世界政局中的分歧，尼赫鲁说，他希望他们所做的一切事都有助于沟通分歧，但是“我们心中并没有抱着什么具体的目标，只是要了解一般的局势”。
    尼赫鲁在谈到塞浦路斯问题时说，在这个问题上不存在印度支持英国政府的问题。“我们将实事求是地独立判断局势”。他又说，塞浦路斯问题是非常复杂的问题。一方面，印度显然赞成自由，反对暴力。但是这个问题非常困难，随便提出建议是相当鲁莽的。
    尼赫鲁谈到在伦敦同其他英联邦总理所进行的会谈时说，最有益的一部分是“我们大家在一起的会谈”。
