    Wuhan Steel Morning
    Special Correspondent of this Newspaper: Xu Chi
    We are awakened in the morning by the distant cooing of "Cuckoo, cuckoo, cuckoo."

    The sky has just been smeared with a faint layer of red light, and some street lights are still shining. Some early-rising staff are brushing their teeth at the door, while workers are already hurrying across the fields to the construction site.

    The excavator operators start work at six o'clock in the morning. We also planned to arrive at the construction site at six o'clock. Secretary Long of the Communist Youth League Committee learned of this idea. This enthusiastic man got us a car. As we were getting ready, he came in and told us that the car was already parked by the roadside.

    Naturally, the road to the construction site is always muddy, bumpy, and quite far from the large company. Actually, we are already used to it. Walking on such a road is the most pleasant thing – walking to the great construction site.

    It is impossible to refuse him. He himself is in front of the car door, watching you get in the car, watching the car drive away. Sometimes, you will meet such enthusiastic people who are considerate to you in every way.

    The car sped along, here are winding paths, the rice fields are filled with spring water. The morning air is tranquil, and peach and plum trees and farmhouses are all reflected in the water.

    We passed the auxiliary factory, also known as the production enterprise's factory area, and then drove in the fields again. Yellow rapeseed flowers flashed before our eyes, and purple water lilies in the pond. Suddenly, the Wuhan Thermal Power Plant's construction site towered before you, rows of scaffolding, and cranes. A particularly tall, particularly large chimney pierced the sky. No pagoda is as high as it: the Kaifeng Iron Pagoda is fifty meters high, only half its height.

    After passing through the thermal power plant construction site, we got out of the car and walked on the dew-moistened grass.

    We arrived at the construction site of Wuhan Iron and Steel Company.

    The loudspeaker broadcast the chorus of "The East is Red." The day's work begins like this.

    We walked into the area where a dozen bulldozers were crawling and winding. The bulldozer's iron plates were also covered with dew. They were digging up the soil, pulling hard forward, and the soil was "rustling."

    We crossed this dawn's hill of earth. The sky is getting redder and redder. We walked to the front of Construction Site No. 3, which was a desolate little hill that had already been half dug away. More than a dozen excavators, like a line in front of a city wall of earth, were all working up and down. On the two roads going back and forth, dozens of dump trucks were flying around in a noisy and endless cycle.

    The sun rises from the horizon, lovingly illuminating everything.

    This is a brilliant April day. Amidst the sound of locomotives, the cuckoo is calling again.

    In this bright morning, we saw Wang Guijun, the leader of a youth shock brigade at Wuhan Steel. He is a rosy-cheeked young man, only twenty-two years old. He came from the Northeast to Huangshi, and then from Huangshi to Wuhan. In the Northeast, he was a mechanical fitter. It has not been two years since he started driving excavators.

    "We are all young. Do you ask if there are master craftsmen here? Yes, there are also a few master craftsmen, you see, he is one of them," Wang Guijun said, pointing to a worker who was walking towards him.

    However, the one coming was also a young man. Wang Guijun smiled, "Our master craftsmen have only studied one or two years more than others." Then he asked the master craftsman, "What's the matter?"

    "Today, you should 'nen' (弄 - do) that No. 301," the person said. He pronounced "do a bit" as "nen a bit". 301 is the number of another excavator.

    "Okay, I'll go in a bit," he said.

    At this time, driving his famous No. 307 excavator was a shock team member, who was sitting in the driver's cab stretching his legs and arms, pushing and pulling some levers. When the shovel bucket rotated over, you could just see his slightly vibrating whole body, wearing a blue khaki top, with a red and white striped vest exposed. After a while, the shovel bucket rotated away again, and you couldn't see him, and after a while it rotated back again, and you saw him sitting in the cab just as if a full-body photo was fitted in a frame, his eyes fixed on the shovel bucket.

    We wanted to ask Wang Guijun to operate the machine to take a picture of him, but he flatly refused:

    "No, this will affect the work."

    The excavator operators calculate their work efficiency by the second.

    He said, "Let's talk about it." And asked, "What to talk about?"

    The enthusiastic Secretary Long, knowing that we were interested in Wang Guijun, had already given us three pieces of information about him. We have all read the materials. One piece was written by Wang Guijun himself: "How I learned technology, cherished machinery, and overfulfilled tasks." There are many places in it, such as "... because the rotary clutch cannot release the brake, causing the brake shoe to jam with the rocker arm small shaft..." etc. that are incomprehensible, this is a technical summary.

    Another piece of material is divided into four paragraphs: The subheadings are cherish the locomotive like cherishing your own eyes; there are no difficulties that cannot be overcome in front of shock team members; learn advanced operations and improve technical level; unite and help each other, and advance together. This piece of material is very detailed, but a bit empty.

    Another one is written more vividly, but some places are also very simple. For example, Wang Guijun came to the construction site and waited for the excavator to be assigned. At that time, everyone wanted to be assigned a good one, but later, they assigned a "most difficult to use" excavator to Wang Guijun. That material said "Wang Guijun was very happy. He loved this machine!"

    "Is there such a thing?" We asked.

    He laughed. Later, he told us that this is how things happened.

    This construction site started construction in August 1955. Before this, there were only tents and geological markers of the geological company, saying that, he pointed to a triangular wire mesh nearby.

    The first to be built was the building base - in mid-August, houses for people to live in, without leveling the ground. In mid-September, the auxiliary factory buildings were leveled first, where the bulldozers were responsible for the task.

    A day or two later, their excavator operators also came out. At that time, there was no road built to the construction site, so they drove to the wilderness and drove all the way to the thermal power plant construction site. The task of leveling the ground at the thermal power plant was very large, more than 400,000 cubic meters.

    The allocation of excavators was carried out at the thermal power plant construction site. At that time, there were two types of excavators, one digging one cubic meter and the other digging 0.5 cubic meters. Wang Guijun saw that everyone wanted the one-cubic-meter locomotive, and they did not like the 0.5-cubic-meter one, and they thought it was difficult to use.

    He thought to himself, if the country bought such a machine, if no one loved it or was willing to use it, wouldn't it be a waste? But even though he thought so in his heart, he did not clearly express that he was willing to use the 0.5-cubic-meter excavator. When he was studying, he also studied the one-cubic-meter one.

    He didn't say anything, to see which one he would be assigned to. If it was the one-cubic-meter locomotive, he would of course like it, but if he was assigned to the other one, he could also accept it. Later, the leaders assigned the 0.5-cubic-meter excavator to him.

    He was not "very happy" because he was very unfamiliar with this locomotive, and when he started test driving it, it had problems, and he could not "fall in love with this machine" at first.

    The first day, the first shovel, went smoothly, the second shovel was also okay. The third shovel, when he wanted to turn the shovel rod, the shovel rod would not listen to commands, and the shovel door could not be opened.

    The car stopped, and it stopped until the night. The team members were all depressed and pondering, what to do? Could it be that it should be stopped? The task is very large, how can it be stopped?

    Wang Guijun was born as a mechanical fitter, which was very convenient for him. First of all, he decided not to send the locomotive back for repair. He pulled the control lever, followed the parts it transmitted, chased the fault, found it on the rotary clutch, and solved it.

    The shovel rod was obedient, but the shovel door could not be opened. A foreman came to see it and said that it should be burned with oxygen, but at that time there was no oxygen welder on the construction site. He asked them when they would come? The answer was, maybe, three or four days later! What to do? Night came, and he was still thinking of a way. He thought that the shovel door could not be opened because it must be closed too tightly. If he didn't let it close too tightly, he would block it with an iron bar! He jumped up, shining a flashlight on and off, to find an iron bar on the construction site.

    The construction site was still leveling the ground on the first day, where could he find an iron bar? After a long time, he actually found a screw nail. A screw nail would also work, he tied it to the shovel door. After working hard for most of the night, he actually solved the problem. The next morning, No. 307 worked very well.

    It turned out that from the first day, Wang Guijun was such an enthusiastic, tireless, and indomitable builder. Later, he solved many constantly occurring difficulties, and No. 307 listened to their commands.

    The master craftsman came again to urge Wang Guijun to fix the No. 301 excavator. It turned out that No. 307 had not been overhauled since it participated in the construction. According to regulations, this locomotive should be overhauled every two thousand and four hundred hours, but by this morning, it had worked for more than four thousand hours. This is an amazing achievement. It has maintained the highest attendance rate.

    On this morning, Wang Guijun was going to adjust the No. 301 locomotive, and then use it to work, so that No. 307 could be overhauled in the repair shop.

    While we were talking, bulldozers, excavators, and dump trucks roared. The hills and depressions retreated in front of them. Looking around, here, there, leveling work was in progress, but you could not see a laborer carrying soil with his shoulders.

    Wang Guijun's plan this year is to dig 168,000 cubic meters of soil. The first quarter plan has already been completed. The whole factory's task this year is five million cubic meters, and the total task is nearly 20 million cubic meters. This is simply a mythical labor of moving dozens of mountains away.

    The field crawling with so many locomotives is the future Wuhan Steel large factory.

    The place where we stood is the ironmaking area.

    In April, the preparatory project was basically completed. The large factory project started.

    The morning sun rose very high. The morning sun in April is already very hot. The dew turned into water vapor, and the water vapor evaporated. In a corner, you can still see farmers driving water buffaloes slowly moving in the rice fields. But on this entire field, you see strings of concrete transport vehicles coming from the tall mixing plant. Tower cranes lift prefabricated steel bars. Female welders are welding them. There are plenty of movable templates and lifting templates here, and the concrete is tamped with vibrators, and you can't see a single iron pick. On this construction site, you see fewer people than on other construction sites, because its degree of mechanized and industrialized construction is much higher than other construction sites.

    In Wuhan Steel, I don't know how many youth shock troopers like Wang Guijun there are! According to Secretary Long, they have forty-nine already named youth shock brigades, no wonder he is so energetic! In addition, they also have more than one hundred youth teams. It is the flame of youth and the light of youth of these builders that shines on this future steel base like this April morning.

    On this base with so many powerful machines moving mountains and overturning seas, first-class large blast furnaces and open-hearth furnaces in the world will soon appear, and huge factory buildings will be stacked layer by layer. Wuhan Steel will be the most advanced industrial base.

    What a beautiful morning at Wuhan Steel!

    武钢之晨
    本报特约记者　徐迟
    早晨把我们唤醒的是远远的“布谷，布谷，布谷”的啼声。
    天空刚抹上一层淡淡的红光，还有些路灯在发亮呢。一些起早的工作人员在门口刷牙，工人们却已经从田野中穿过，急忙忙地到工地去了。
    挖土机手在早上六点钟开始工作。我们也准备六点钟赶到工地。这个想法给团委龙书记知道了。这位热情澎湃的人给我们要了车。我们正梳洗，他就进来，告诉我们，车已经停在路边。
    自然，到工地去的路总是泥泞不堪，坎坷不平，而且离大公司相当远的。其实我们已经习惯了。徒步走在这样的路上是最快意的事——走上伟大建设工地去。
    拒绝他也是办不到的。他自己就在车门前，看你上车，看车开掉。有时候，你就会遇到这样热情的人，对你无微不至。
    车驰行了，这儿阡陌弯弯，稻田里贮满春水。早晨的空气宁静，桃李田舍都在倒影中。
    我们经过了附属工厂，又称生产企业的厂区，又驰行在田野中。在我们眼前闪过了黄黄的油菜花，池塘中紫色的荇藻。一下子武汉热电厂的工地已经高耸在你面前，一排排的脚手架，一台台的塔式起重机。一个特别高，特别大的烟囱，高插云霄。没有一个宝塔有它那么高：开封铁塔高五十公尺，只及它的一半。
    穿过热电厂工地后，我们下了车，走上露珠润湿的草地。
    我们来到了武汉钢铁公司的工地上。
    扩音喇叭送来了“东方红”的合唱声。一天的工作就这样开始。
    我们走进十几辆铲运机爬行盘绕的区域。铲运机铁板上也全是露水。他们刨起泥土，使劲往前拉，泥土“簌簌”地响着。
    我们越过了这黎明的泥土的丘陵地。天空越来越红。我们走到三号工地前面，那是一个已经给挖去了一半的荒凉的小山岗。十几辆挖土机，像在一座泥土的城墙之前排开一样，都在一上一下地工作。来去两条公路上，噪噪杂杂的几十辆自卸车正在循环不息地飞奔。
    太阳从地平线上升起来，爱恋地照亮了这一切。
    这是一个灿烂的四月天。机车声中，布谷鸟又在啼叫了。
    在这光明的早晨，我们看到武钢的一个青年突击队队长王贵君。他是一个脸色红红的青年，才二十二岁。他从东北来到黄石，又从黄石来到武汉。在东北时，他是一个机械钳工。他自从开挖土机到现在还不满两年。
    “我们都是年轻的。你问这儿有老师傅吗？有，也有几个老师傅，你看，他就是一个。”王贵君说，指着正向他走来的一个工人。
    不过，走来的这个也是个青年。王贵君笑了，“我们的老师傅只是比别人多学了一年两年。”于是向老师傅问：“什么事？”
    “今天你把那三○一号弄一弄吧，”那个人说。他把“弄一弄”说成“嫩一嫩”。三○一是另一台挖土机的号码。
    “好，我一会儿就去。”他说。
    这时候，驾驶着他那一台有名的三○七号挖土机的是一个突击队员，那人坐在驾驶室里伸长腿，拉长臂，手推着拉着一些杠杆。当锹斗旋转过来时，你恰好可以看见他微微震动的全身，披着蓝色卡其布的上衣，袒胸露出一件红白条纹的背心。一会儿，锹斗又旋转过去，看不见了，一会又旋转过来，你看见他坐在驾驶室里正像一张全身照片装在镜框中一样合适，两眼钉住锹斗。
    我们想请王贵君上机车去操作一下，好给他照相，他干脆地拒绝了：
    “不好，这影响工作。”
    挖土机手是以秒来计算他们的工效的。
    他说：“还是让我们谈一谈吧。”又问：“谈什么呢？”
    热情的龙书记在知道我们对王贵君有兴趣之后，早就给了我们关于他的三份材料。材料我们都看了。一份是王贵君自己写的：“我是怎样学习技术、爱护机具、超额完成任务的”。其中有不少地方，如“……是因为回转离合器，不能放闸，使闸皮与摇臂小轴卡着……”等是看不懂的，这是篇技术总结。
    另外一份材料分四段：小标题是爱护机车像爱护自己的眼睛一样；在突击队员面前没有克服不了的困难；学习先进操作，提高技术水平；团结互助，共同前进。这一份材料很详细，但是有点空洞。
    另外一份写得比较生动，可是有的地方也很简单。例如，王贵君来到工地，听候分配挖土机。那时大家都想分到一部好的，但后来，却把一部“最不好使唤”的挖土机分给王贵君了。那份材料中说“王贵君很高兴。他爱这部机器！”
    “有这样的事吗？”我们问。
    他好笑起来。后来，他告诉我们，事情是这样的。
    这个工地是在1955年8月开始施工的。这以前只有地质公司的帐篷和这些地质标志，说着，他指了指近傍一个三角形铁丝网。
    首先建设的是建筑基地——八月中，住人的房子，不用平土。九月中，先是附属厂房平土，那里是铲运机担任的任务。
    稍后一两天，他们挖土机手也出动了。那时，还没有修起通到工地去的道路，他们就向原野上开，一直开到热电厂工地。热电厂的平土任务很大，有四十多万方呢。
    就在热电厂工地上进行挖土机的分配。那时有挖一方和挖零点五方的两种挖土机。王贵君看大家都想要挖一方的机车，而对挖零点五的都不爱，他们认为它难使唤。
    他心里想，国家买了这样的机器，如果谁都不爱，都不愿用，这不是浪费了吗？不过心里虽这末想，他也没有明白表示他是愿用这挖零点五的挖土机的。他学习的时候，也学了那挖一方的。
    他不作声，看到底分配他哪一种。如果是那挖一方的机车，他当然喜欢，但如果分配到另一种，他也可以接受。后来领导上把那挖零点五方的挖土机分配给他了。
    他并不是“很高兴”，因为他对这台机车很陌生，并且他一开始试车，它就出问题，他也并不能最初就“爱上这部机器”。
    第一天，第一锹，很顺利，第二锹，也可以。第三锹，当他要转动锹杆时，锹杆就不听指挥了，再开锹门，也打不开了。
    车停下，一停就停到夜晚。队员们都苦闷地沉思着，怎末办呢？难道就让它停下来吗？任务很大，怎末能停？
    王贵君是机械钳工出身的，这对他有很大便利。首先他决定不把机车送回去修理。他拉动操纵杆，沿着它传动的部件，追寻着毛病，在回转离合器上发现了它，解决了它。
    锹杆倒是服从指挥了，可是锹门还是打不开。有个工长走来看了看，说要用氧气烧，可是那时工地上还没有氧焊工。他问他们什么时候来呢？回答说，也许，三四天后吧！怎末办呢？夜来了，他还在想办法。他想到锹门打不开，一定是关得太紧了。如果不让它关得太紧，用一根铁棍拦住它！他跳起来，一闪一闪地亮着一个手电筒，要在工地上寻找铁棍。
    工地还在平土第一天，那里找得到铁棍呢？好半天，居然找到了一只螺旋钉。螺旋钉也行，他把它绑扎在锹门上。闹了大半夜，居然解决了问题。第二天清早，三○七号就很好地工作起来。
    原来从第一天起，王贵君就是这样一个热情的、不知疲倦、不屈不挠的建设家。以后，他解决了许多不断地发生的困难，三○七号就听他们使唤了。
    老师傅又来催王贵君去弄那三○一号挖土机了。原来那三○七号从参加施工以来，一直没有检修过。按规定，这台机车超过二千四百小时就要中修一次，可是到这个早晨，它已经工作了四千多小时。这是一个惊人的成就。它保持了最高的出勤率。
    就在这个早晨，王贵君要把三○一号机车调整一下，然后拿它来工作，好让三○七号进修配厂中修一次。
    在我们谈话的时候，铲运机、挖土机、自卸车轰响着。山岗和洼地在它们面前退让。放眼望去，这里，那里，平土的工作都在进行，但是你看不到一个用肩膀挑土的劳动者。
    王贵君今年的计划是挖土十六万八千方。其中第一季度计划早已完成。全厂，今年的任务是五百万方，全部任务是将近两千万方。这简直像是将几十座山搬走的神话一般的劳动。
    爬行着这末多的机车的原野上，就是未来的武钢的大厂。
    我们站立的地方是炼铁区。
    四月，准备工程基本上完成了。大厂工程开了工。
    朝阳升起得很高了。四月的朝阳已经很灼热。露珠化为水气，水气蒸发干了。在一个角落里，你还可以看见农民驱着水牛在稻田中缓慢地移动。但在这整个原野上，你看见的是成串的混凝土运输车辆从高大的搅拌厂里开来。塔式吊车把预制钢筋吊上去。女电焊工在焊接它们。这里有的是活动模板和提升模板，这里捣固混凝土，全用震动器，看不见一根铁钎子。这一个建设工地上，你看比起其他的建设工地来人更少，因为它的机械化工厂化施工的程度，比较其他的工地又高了许多。
    在武钢，像王贵君那样的青年突击手不知有多少呢！照龙书记说的是他们有四十九个已经命名的青年突击队，怪不得他这样精力饱满！此外，他们还有一百多个青年班组。正是这些建设家的青春的火焰，青春的光芒像这个四月的早晨一样，闪耀在这未来的钢铁基地上。
    在这么多强大的机具移山倒海一样的、轰响着的基地上，很快将出现世界上第一流的大高炉和大平炉，将出现层层叠叠的巨大的厂房。武钢将是一个最先进的工业基地。
    多末美丽的武钢之晨啊！
