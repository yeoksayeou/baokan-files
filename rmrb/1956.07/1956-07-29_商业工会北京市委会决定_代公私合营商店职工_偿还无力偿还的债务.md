Xinhua News Agency, July 27th - The person in charge of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Commercial Trade Union requested at a meeting held yesterday that the subordinate grassroots trade union organizations repay the debts of employees of joint state-private shops in accordance with regulations.

For more than half a month, commercial trade union organizations at all levels in Beijing investigated the living welfare conditions of more than 34,000 employees of joint state-private shops, and found that more than 2,100 employees and their directly supported family members owed a lot of debts due to illness or financial difficulties. Among these, apart from those that can be repaid within this year, there are more than 148,000 yuan of debts that they are unable to repay.

The Beijing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Commercial Trade Union has decided to repay all of the debts they are unable to repay. In the funds already allocated, apart from a portion being the surplus of grassroots trade union funds and employee welfare funds, the majority is uniformly adjusted by the Beijing Federation of Trade Unions from the labor insurance fund.

While repaying the debts for employees, the grassroots trade unions will further understand the problems and difficulties in the lives of employees and continue to help solve them.

    商业工会北京市委会决定
    代公私合营商店职工
    偿还无力偿还的债务
    新华社27日讯　中国商业工会北京市委员会负责人在昨天举行的一次会上，要求所属基层工会组织按规定代公私合营商店的职工偿还债务。
    半个多月来，北京市各级商业工会组织调查了公私合营商店三万四千多名职工的生活福利情况，发现有二千一百多个职工本人和供养的直系亲属因病或生活困难，都欠有很多债务，其中除今年内能够偿还的以外，还有十四万八千多元债务无力偿还。
    中国商业工会北京市委员会决定全部代他们偿还无力偿还的债务。在已经拨出的款额中，除一部分是基层工会的经费节余和职工福利费以外，大部分是北京市工会联合会统一由劳动保险金内调剂出来的。
    各基层工会在代职工偿还债务的同时，还将进一步了解职工生活中的问题和困难，继续帮助解决。
