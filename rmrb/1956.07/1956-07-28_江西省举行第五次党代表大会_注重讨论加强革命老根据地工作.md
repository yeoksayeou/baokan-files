Xinhua News Agency, Lushan, July 26th: The Fifth Congress of the Communist Party of China in Jiangxi Province, recently held in Lushan, discussed the issue of further strengthening work in old revolutionary base areas. The congress began on the 1st and concluded on the 22nd. A total of 499 delegates attended, representing more than 250,000 party members throughout the province.

The congress focused on discussing and studying a series of new issues that have emerged under the new situation, summarized the experiences and lessons learned in socialist construction and socialist transformation in Jiangxi Province since liberation, and conducted criticism and self-criticism.

This congress of the Jiangxi Provincial Party Committee is the first since the Second Domestic Revolutionary War. During the First Domestic Revolutionary War, the Jiangxi Provincial Party organization organized workers' movements, peasant movements, and youth movements, which powerfully coordinated with the Northern Expedition. Two provincial party congresses were held during this period. During the Second Domestic Revolutionary War, two party congresses were also held. At that time, under the direct leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and with the strong cooperation of party organizations in other regions, the party organization in Jiangxi Province relied on the broad masses of the people to make significant contributions to the creation of the Red Army and the establishment of revolutionary base areas such as the Central District, the Hunan-Hubei-Jiangxi District, and the Fujian-Zhejiang-Anhui-Jiangxi District.

The congress emphasized the important significance of further strengthening work in the old base areas. The congress pointed out that the area of the old revolutionary base areas in Jiangxi Province accounts for more than two-thirds of the province's area, and the population accounts for more than half of the province's population. Therefore, further strengthening work in the old base areas is a very important task in Jiangxi Province. Mobilizing the strength of cadres and people in the old base areas is one of the important tasks in mobilizing all positive factors to build the socialist motherland.

The congress pointed out that the previous provincial party committee has always attached importance to the work in the old revolutionary base areas. In the seven years since liberation, the party and government leadership in Jiangxi Province have actively led and assisted the people of the old revolutionary base areas in carrying out the work of rebuilding their homes. A large amount of production, living subsidies, and relief funds have been distributed successively to help the people in the old base areas purchase cattle, farm tools, and build houses. At present, agricultural cooperation has been realized in all the old revolutionary base areas in the province, and the living standards of the people have also been greatly improved. According to investigation materials from Ruijin, Xingguo, and other four counties, 70% of the farmers in the old base areas have risen to the living standards of middle peasants, but 20% to 30% of the farmers still have relatively difficult lives due to a lack of or loss of labor.

Since liberation, more than 1,400 veteran cadres from the Second Domestic Revolutionary War period have been employed throughout the province. However, there are still many problems in the use of veteran cadres, mainly that too few veteran cadres are being used. For example, in Ruijin County during the Second Domestic Revolutionary War, there were 2,200 main cadres above the township level, but only 120 are currently employed. The congress analyzed that the main reasons why some veteran cadres have not been trusted and used are that some cadres underestimate the role played by veteran cadres in history and their close ties with the local masses; some excessively exaggerate certain historical blemishes and historical complexity of veteran cadres; some believe that veteran cadres who dare to express opinions and dare to criticize are mischievous and difficult to lead; and some believe that these people are old, have low educational levels, and have no prospects for development. The congress criticized these erroneous views and made specific instructions for improving this situation.

The congress made a resolution on further strengthening work in the old revolutionary base areas. The resolution pointed out: "Vigorously restoring and developing the economy of the old base areas is the central link in further strengthening all work in the old base areas." In order to more effectively exert the role of cadres in the old base areas, "the work and party membership issues of veteran cadres in the old base areas must be seriously resolved." The congress believes that this is a special and important political task for party organizations at all levels in Jiangxi Province. The congress also believes that it is necessary to further improve the work of preferential treatment and relief for the families of martyrs, military dependents, and disabled soldiers.

The congress believes that if party organizations at all levels in Jiangxi Province can do a good job in the old base areas, the veteran cadres and the masses in the old base areas throughout the province will be able to carry forward the revolutionary tradition, strive for greater glory, and make more contributions to the motherland.

Finally, the congress elected 41 new members of the Provincial Committee, 15 alternate members, and 23 delegates to the Eighth National Party Congress.

    江西省举行第五次党代表大会
    注重讨论加强革命老根据地工作
    据新华社庐山26日电　最近在庐山举行的中国共产党江西省第五次代表大会上，讨论了进一步加强革命老根据地的工作问题。这次代表大会从一日开始，到二十二日闭幕。出席代表共499人，代表着全省二十五万多名党员。
    这次代表大会着重讨论和研究了新形势下出现的一系列新问题，总结了江西省解放以来社会主义建设和社会主义改造的经验教训，开展了批评和自我批评。
    江西省的这次党代表大会，是第二次国内革命战争以后的第一次。在第一次国内革命战争时期，江西省党组织组织了工人运动、农民运动和青年运动，有力地配合了北伐战争，在此期间召开过两次全省党代表大会。在第二次国内革命战争时期，也召开过两次党代表大会，当时江西省党的组织，在党中央和毛主席的直接领导下，在其他地区党组织的有力配合下，依靠广大人民，对于创造红军，建立中央区、湘鄂赣区、闽浙皖赣区等革命根据地，作出了重大的贡献。
    这次党代表大会强调了进一步加强老根据地工作的重要意义。大会指出，江西省革命老根据地的面积占全省面积的三分之二以上，人口占全省的半数以上；因此，进一步加强老根据地工作在江西省说来是一项很重要的工作；把老根据地干部和人民的力量调动起来，是调动一切积极因素建设社会主义祖国的重要工作之一。
    大会指出：上届省委对革命老根据地工作一直是重视的，解放七年来，江西省党政领导方面积极领导和帮助革命老根据地人民进行了重建家园的工作。先后发放了大量生产、生活补助款和救济款，帮助老根据地人民购买耕牛、农具和修建房屋。目前全省革命老根据地都已实现了农业合作化，人民的生活水平也有了很大提高。根据瑞金、兴国等四县调查材料，老根据地有70％的农户已上升到中农的生活水平，但还有20％到30％的农户由于缺少或丧失了劳动力，生活还比较困难。
    解放以来，全省已吸收了一千四百多个第二次国内革命战争时期的老干部参加工作。但对老干部使用上还存在很多问题，主要是对老干部使用得太少了。如瑞金县第二次国内革命战争时期，乡级以上的主要干部有二千二百人，现在只使用了一百二十人。大会分析了部分老干部所以没有得到信任和使用的主要原因是部分干部对老干部在历史上所起的作用及其和当地群众的密切联系估计不足；有的过分夸大老干部的某些历史污点和历史复杂性；有的认为老干部敢于提意见、敢于批评是调皮捣蛋，不好领导；还有的认为这些人年纪大，文化程度低，没有发展前途。大会批判了这些错误观点，并对这种情况的改进作出了具体的指示。
    这次大会作出了关于进一步加强革命老根据地工作的决议。决议中指出：“大力恢复和发展老根据地的经济，是进一步加强老根据地各项工作的中心环节。”为了更有效的发挥老根据地干部的作用，“必须认真解决老根据地老干部的工作和党籍问题”。大会认为这是江西省各级党组织的一项特殊的重要的政治任务。大会还认为必须进一步作好烈属、军属和残废军人的优抚救济工作。
    大会认为，江西全省各级党组织如果能够作好老根据地的工作，全省老根据地的老干部和人民群众就能够发挥革命传统，争取更大光荣，为祖国作出更多的贡献。
    大会最后选出了四十一名新的省委员会委员，十五名候补委员和二十三名出席第八次全国党代表大会的代表。
