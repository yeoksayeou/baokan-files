    Shedding This Layer of Conservatism
    People always think that those who work in the Communist Youth League must be young and energetic, but some places have completely broken this "convention." For example, in Liaoning Province, many township Communist Youth League general branch secretaries are strong men in their thirties and forties, or even old men in their fifties and sixties. In Xifeng County, out of the thirty-five township League general branch secretaries, only two were in their thirties, twenty-five were between thirty and forty, and eight were over fifty. It is of course very difficult for these old men, who are over half a century old with grizzled hair, to lead the work of the Communist Youth League well. For example, the Panshan County League Committee wanted a 59-year-old township League general branch secretary to carry out work according to the characteristics of young people. This secretary was extremely distressed and could not find the characteristics of young people after searching for a long time.
    Why are so many old men allowed to do the work of young people? It is said that they are afraid that young people cannot do it, and that older people must concurrently hold the position. Even if these old men are incompetent when holding the position concurrently, they are very relieved and unwilling to promote a few young people to give it a try. In fact, as long as we shed this layer of conservative thought, this situation can be greatly improved.

    剥掉这层保守思想
    人们总以为干青年团工作的人，一定都是年轻有朝气的，可是有些地方却完全打破了这种“常规”。像辽宁省就有许多乡青年团总支书记是三、四十岁的壮年，甚至五、六十岁的老年。西丰县三十五个乡团总支书记中，三十岁的仅有二人，三十岁到四十岁的有二十五人，五十岁以上的还有八人。这样一些年过半百、须发斑白的老头子，要领导好青年团的工作，当然是有很大困难的。比如盘山县团委，要一个五十九岁的乡团总支书记，根据青年人的特点进行工作，这个书记苦恼极了，找了许多时候，找不到青年人的特点。
    为什么要让这么多的老头子做青年人的工作呢？据说是：怕青年人干不了，必须要上了年纪的人兼任。即使这些老头子兼而不能胜任，他们也很放心，而不愿提几个青年人闯一闯。其实呢？只要剥去一层保守思想，这种现状就可以大大改观的。
