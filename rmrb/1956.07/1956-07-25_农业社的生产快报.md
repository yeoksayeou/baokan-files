    Agricultural Cooperative Production Bulletin
    Chen Kenhua
    In March 1955, the only agricultural production cooperative in the Dutao District of Linhai County, Zhejiang, started a blackboard newspaper called "Production Bulletin." In November, this cooperative merged with three nearby cooperatives and was upgraded to a higher-level cooperative—the Diligent Agricultural Production Cooperative. The production organization was divided into four brigades, and the blackboard newspapers were increased to four. After the start of spring plowing this year, the cooperative had heavy production tasks and many ideological problems among its members. To take care of the members' health and reduce meetings, the Party branch and the cooperative committee decided to add a mimeographed "Production Bulletin" as a tool for guiding production and educating members.
    The mimeographed "Production Bulletin" includes news, poems, and illustrations. It contains praise, as well as criticism and reports of shortcomings being corrected after criticism. When the wheat was about to ripen, the bulletin called on everyone to prepare and harvest the wheat well, and praised the female members who enthusiastically cut the wheat. In June, there was a heavy rain, and the bulletin immediately mobilized the members to bail out water and save all the submerged seedlings. Member Jin Renzhou only cared about earning work points. The bulletin published a short rhyme criticizing him: "When planting and transplanting rice, you don't lift a hand, but when recording work points, you're at the front." "Doing work is like a swallow carrying mud; evaluating work points is like Wu Song fighting a tiger." As soon as this bulletin, which contained these fresh events, was published, literate members rushed to read it, and illiterate members asked others to tell them what it said. The members quickly knew what the newspaper was saying and started doing it.
    Jin Lusheng, the Party branch secretary, attached importance to leading the work of the bulletin and promptly urged members to write articles, sometimes writing them himself. The cooperative's club has a "Bulletin Group," and the group leader is a member of the cooperative committee, with four members distributed in the four production brigades. In this way, the activities of the whole cooperative and each brigade can be reflected in the newspaper in a timely manner. Local primary school teachers often help the "Bulletin Group" write and edit articles, as well as cut stencils, draw illustrations, and print the newspaper. The cost of running the bulletin is very low. The mimeographed "Production Bulletin" prints 32 copies per issue, costing only one dime. The four blackboards for the blackboard newspaper and the four blackboards for special reports on domestic and international events are worth a total of twenty yuan, which have been gradually added over the past year or so. The members like these two kinds of "Production Bulletins" very much, praising them for their great effect, low cost, and good quality.

    农业社的生产快报
    陈垦华
    1955年三月，浙江临海县杜桃区的唯一农业生产合作社办了一块黑板报“生产快报”。十一月里这个社同附近的三个社合并升为高级社——勤劳农业生产合作社，生产组织划为四个大队，黑板报也就增加到四块。今年春耕开始后，社里的生产任务重，社员的思想问题多，为照顾社员身体健康又要减少会议，党分支部和社务委员会便决定再增出油印的“生产快报”一种，作为指导生产和教育社员的工具。
    油印的“生产快报”登的有消息、诗歌、插图。有表扬，也有批评和批评后改正缺点的报道。麦子快熟的时候，快报号召大家作好准备、收好麦子，并且表扬了踊跃割麦子的女社员。六月里下了一场大雨，快报立刻动员社员去戽水，救出全部被水淹的秧苗。社员金仁周光图挣工分，快报便登了一首小唱，批评他“种田插秧不动手，记工分，前头走。”“做工作，真像燕子衔泥；评工分，好比武松打虎。”登着这些新鲜事的快报一出版，识字的社员争着看，不识字的要别人马上讲给他们听。社员很快就知道报上说些什么，并且动手做起来。
    党支部书记金吕生重视领导快报的工作，还及时催促社员写稿，有时自己也写稿。合作社的俱乐部设有“快报组”，组长是社务委员，四个组员分布在四个生产大队里。这样全社和各个队的活动，就能及时在报上反映。当地的小学教师经常帮助“快报组”的人写稿编稿，还帮他们刻写蜡纸、画插画、印报。办快报的费用很省。油印的“生产快报”每期印32份，只花一角钱。出黑板报的四块黑板和专登国内外大事的四块黑板，一共值二十元，是一年多来逐步添置起来的。社员很喜欢这两种“生产快报”，夸它作用大、花钱少、办得好。
