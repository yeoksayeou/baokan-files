    Random Thoughts

    Regarding the "buy one get one free" scheme for seeing plays (see the 26th issue of this newspaper), it turns out it’s not unique to Woyang County, but also exists in Anhui Province, though in Quanjiao County. According to a reader, when the film screening team there shows "The Fairy Maiden," they also show "Glorious Family," and the ticket price is, of course, increased. "Glorious Family" has already been shown many times in Quanjiao. Many viewers have already seen it and don’t want to see it again. So they explained their reasons for not wanting to see it to the person in charge. In fact, even if they didn't explain, the other party understood very well. The result of the negotiation: the audience was slapped with a big label. You want to know what the person in charge said?
      "Why don't you want to watch it? This is to increase national wealth!"

    The American "Time" magazine has expressed great unease about the correspondence between Chinese students and their relatives (Xinhua News Agency dispatch on July 6). It said that these letters "arouse traditional feelings of love for the family and cause each student to doubt his situation in the United States."
    The American rulers, who are extremely concerned about the freedom of thought in other countries, actually consider "love for the family," no matter how "traditional" or common it is in human society, as an illegal thought, or "un-American" thought, or "subversive" thought, or a Soviet and Chinese "aggressive" thought...
    One day, "Home, Sweet Home" (the widely circulated American song "Home, Sweet Home") will also be examined by Mr. Dulles' microscope and found to contain Communist propaganda!

    关于看戏“买一送一”的事（见二十六日本版），竟然无独有偶，并非涡阳县的独创。地点还是安徽省，不过换了全椒县。据读者反映，那儿的电影放映队在放映“天仙配”时，连带放映“光荣人家”，票价当然照加。“光荣人家”在全椒已经放映过好多次了。许多观众早已看过，不想再看。于是向负责人申述不要看的理由。其实这理由即使不说，对方也明白得很。交涉结果：观众头上被扣上一顶大帽子。你道负责人怎么说？
      “你们为什么不看？这是为了增加国家财富！”

    美国“时代”周刊对中国留学生同他们的亲人之间的信札来往表示了极大不安（七月六日新华社电）。它说，这些信件“唤起了传统的爱家的感情，并且引起每个留学生对在美国处境的怀疑”。
    非常关心别国的思想自由的美国统治者们，居然把“爱家的感情”，不管它在人类社会中是多么“传统”，多么普遍，也认为是一种不合法思想，或“非美”思想，或“颠复性”思想，或苏联和中国的“侵略”思想……
    总有一天，“Home，Sweet Home”（广泛流传的美国歌曲“可爱的家庭”）也将被杜勒斯氏显微镜审查出，其中含有共产党的宣传！
