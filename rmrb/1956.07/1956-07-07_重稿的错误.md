    Errors in Redundant Articles
    Readers Luo Chang, Li Li, Fang Ling, Yang Boqun, and others wrote to criticize this newspaper for repeatedly publishing the news item "Japanese Ships Arrive at Tanggu New Port to Pick Up Released Japanese War Criminals" on the first and third pages on June 25th. In their letters, Fang Ling and others also pointed out that the news item on the third page of this newspaper mistakenly wrote "Foreign Affairs Department" (外事部) as "Foreign Ministry" (外交部) in "Taro Inoue, Director of the Foreign Affairs Department of the Japanese Red Cross Society," and mistakenly wrote "畑" (Hatake) as "烟" (Yan) in "Ship Representative Hata Michiyoshi."
    Editor: These two criticisms from readers are correct. The editorial department of this newspaper will strive to avoid similar errors from happening again.

    重稿的错误
    读者罗昶、李立、方凌、杨博群等来信，批评本报六月二十五日在第一版和第三版重复登载了“日本轮船到达塘沽新港，接运被释放的日本战争犯罪分子”一则消息。方凌等的来信中，还指出了本报第三版登载的消息中，把“日本红十字会外事部部长井上益太郎”中的“外事部”错为“外交部”，把“乘船代表畑道好”中的“畑”字错为“烟”字。
    编者：读者的这两个批评是正确的。本报编辑部将努力避免再发生类似的错误。
