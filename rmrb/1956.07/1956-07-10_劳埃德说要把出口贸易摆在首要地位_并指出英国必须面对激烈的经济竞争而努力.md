    劳埃德说要把出口贸易摆在首要地位
    并指出英国必须面对激烈的经济竞争而努力
    新华社8日讯　波韦西城（英国威尔士）消息：英国外交大臣劳埃德七月七日在这个城市附近的丁纳斯村一个保守党集会上说，英国必须“把出口贸易放在首位”，英国“必须面对激烈的竞争努力”。
    他说，“更坦率地说，就是我们继续被人称为一大国的权利，将取决于我们重建我们经济实力的成功。”
    劳埃德说，英国要重建国家的健全的财政状况。
    他认为，英国出口商人要有“到外地去做新买卖的热情和决心”和“在海外扩大推销的熟练技巧”。他说，“德国人推销商品工作是进行得非常起劲的。”
    劳埃德在演说里还强调，英国为了战略利益，必须保持它在新加坡、亚丁和塞浦路斯的地位。他说，任何解决塞浦路斯问题的方案必须保证英国能够利用它在塞浦路斯的基地。
