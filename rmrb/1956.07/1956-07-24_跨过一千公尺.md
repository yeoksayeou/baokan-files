    Crossing One Thousand Meters
    Huang Ti
    In the south of the motherland, active among the majestic and beautiful peaks, there is an outstanding geological exploration team—the 404 Exploration Team.
    In this outstanding geological exploration team, there is an outstanding assault drilling rig, which is the famous "May Fourth Youth" drilling rig. This drilling rig not only overfulfills the state's tasks every month, but also breaks records repeatedly, fulfilling its promise to "advance towards one thousand meters" and creating a national record of 1,090 meters for monthly footage (the core footage of one drilling rig in one month).
    The captain and assault team leader of this drilling rig is Wang Guoji, a twenty-three-year-old Communist Party member.
    In 1951, Wang Guoji was still a clerk in a private bookstore in Hankou. He had been working in this small bookstore for four years. As the saying goes, "a waterfront pavilion gets the moonlight first." Despite the bookstore owner's many restrictions, Wang Guoji still read many books, picking up one here and another there, and what he liked to read most was maps—maps of the motherland. Whenever he had free time, he would stand in front of the map, silently memorizing those winding mountain ranges, meandering rivers, and those countless cities and towns like stars... Gradually, he developed a stubborn idea: "Leave this stuffy little bookstore and go to all parts of the vast motherland!"
    Coincidentally, in that year, the Central South Industrial Department's Geological Drilling Brigade was recruiting drilling workers in Hankou, and Wang Guoji secretly signed up without telling the bookstore owner.
    During the exam, there was an essay question: "Why do you want to study drilling?" How should this essay be written? He couldn't possibly say he wanted to travel around the country. As he thought, he suddenly remembered a lesson from his primary school days (that was several years before liberation):
        "China, China!
        Five hundred million people,
        Five thousand years of culture,
        Treasures are endless,
        Buried deep underground!"
    At that time, his young mind thought: "Why are they always buried deep underground? It would be great if they could be dug out!" As for why they couldn't be dug out and what would happen if they were dug out, he didn't think about it. Now, remembering this lesson again (he remembered it firmly), he had many more ideas. Yes, he would write these ideas: "In order to dig out those treasures buried deep underground and build the motherland, I want to learn drilling!" This was his initial ambition.
    As a result of the exam, Wang Guoji was admitted. From then on, he left that small private bookstore and embarked on a brand-new path.
    He was assigned to work in a small drilling team. When he first walked into that giant-like, tall drilling tower and watched the drill rods "whoosh" into the heart of the earth, he was so excited. However, he only followed one shift, and before he even understood how the drill bit could drill into the rock, the captain transferred him to the team headquarters. The explanation was very clear: "The team lacks an accounting clerk. You managed the accounts in the bookstore for a few days and know something about it. Take over temporarily for a couple of days until someone is transferred, then they will replace you."
    However, one day, two days, ten days, half a month, three or four months passed, and there was no news of a replacement. It seemed he was destined to be an accountant. This worried Wang Guoji, and he decided to have a formal conversation with the captain.
    "Captain! Let me go back to the drilling rig. I can't do accounting."
      "Hmm? You're doing fine! Work hard, the organization will train you, and in the future, we will send you to accounting school to study."
      "No, I want to learn drilling!"
      "Why don't you want to learn accounting? Accounting is also a very important job, accounting..." The captain patiently explained the revolutionary division of labor, the meaning and importance of accounting work.
    Wang Guoji was listening, and he did not underestimate accounting work at all. On the contrary, he very much agreed with the captain's evaluation of accounting work. However, after the captain finished speaking, he just kept repeating: "Let me go back to the drilling rig, I want to learn drilling!"
      "Didn't you understand what I said? There are people doing the work on the drilling rig. You should still do accounting!" The captain's words already carried a decisive tone.
      "Captain!..." Wang Guoji's blood rushed to his face, as if he had a stomach full of things to say, but after holding it back for a while, he just blurted out: "If I wanted to do accounting, I wouldn't have come to the drilling team!"
    "Hmm?" The captain realized that he was arguing back and wanted to criticize him a bit, but looking at the young man with his face flushed red, he felt that he was hot-tempered and stubbornly cute, so he didn't say it, but just said: "Let's talk about this issue later. We will answer you after the team headquarters has studied it."
    Soon, Wang Guoji was transferred to the drilling training class organized by the Central South Industrial Department to study drilling.
    After graduating from the drilling training class, Wang Guoji was immediately assigned to the drilling rig as a squad leader.
    For two or three years, he and his comrades traveled through many beautiful mountains and rivers, through wind and rain, and countless times they drove the drill rods into the earth to uncover the secrets of underground treasures. With the growth of the entire geological undertaking, Wang Guoji gradually grew into an excellent drilling technician, becoming the advanced drilling rig squad leader and deputy captain of the 404 Exploration Team. Because he improved the "alloy drill bit" and improved production efficiency, he has been rewarded many times.
    In June 1955, one day, Wang Guoji received a notice from the team headquarters: he was assigned to be the captain of the thirty-ninth drilling rig.
    The thirty-ninth drilling rig was a notorious "troublesome" drilling rig in the team. Not only was its efficiency low, often failing to complete tasks, but the quality often did not meet geological requirements, often causing serious rework and waste. Therefore, everyone shook their heads when mentioning it: "They are number one in our team—but counting backwards."
    Of course, Wang Guoji also knew about these situations. Although it was his first time as a captain, he was not worried because he had this experience: the more difficulties, the more people can be trained. Fighting against difficulties and overcoming them is quite suitable for his personality.
    However, to fight, one must first grasp the enemy's situation. What is the key problem with the thirty-ninth drilling rig? For example, the "hole deviation phenomenon" is a problem in drilling that directly affects quality. Why can others prevent it, but the thirty-ninth drilling rig cannot? Could it be that the technical level of the comrades is low? In order to find out this problem, Wang Guoji decided to convene everyone for a meeting before drilling, with the topic "How to prevent and eliminate the hole deviation phenomenon?" and let the comrades discuss it.
    The discussion proved that everyone's technical level was not lower than others. Comprehensive meeting opinions and adopting corresponding technical measures were sufficient to eliminate the "hole deviation phenomenon" that had emerged in the past.
    This made Wang Guoji feel strange, and he asked everyone: "Why didn't you have a meeting to discuss it earlier?"
      "Meeting? Who is calling it? You just transferred here!" A young man rolled his eyes and muttered.
      "Eh, what about the previous captain? He..."
      "Don't mention him, we were thinking of holding a party to celebrate his transfer."
    "Hey, we have to write a program for him!..." The drillers began to become active.
      "What?" Wang Guoji wanted to ask carefully, but it was already time to start drilling. Everyone entered the drilling tower one after another. This time, Wang Guoji personally controlled the "feeding handle" for the start of drilling, and followed several shifts in a row, helping the drillers implement the technical measures proposed at the meeting. From then on, the "hole deviation phenomenon" was eliminated under the drill rods of the thirty-ninth drilling rig.
    By personally following shifts, Wang Guoji gradually understood the details of this drilling rig. He realized that the key to the backwardness of this drilling rig was not in the equipment, nor in the technical conditions, but in the leadership of the captain.
    It turned out that the former captain, although an old technician, was narrow-minded, conservative, and did not trust the masses. For example, in order to improve drilling efficiency, someone suggested to him to increase pressure and speed up the pace. He immediately said: "That won't work, the machine can't handle it. If there is an accident, are you responsible, or am I?" If you say: "Others are doing it this way, and the footage is progressing very quickly." He would answer like this: "You only look at the fast footage, why don't you look at the stuck drills and broken drill rods?" If you raise any more opinions, he would say: "I was learning drilling before you were even born. Learn the work in front of you first, then try new things!" Some young men, such as Zhou Dazao and Peng Xingyan, these young squad leaders, couldn't bear it, so they secretly did it without telling him. If he found out, regardless of the effect, he would impose the label of being undisciplined. Therefore, some people argued, debated, and sulked with him all day long, and some silently made plans to leave the thirty-ninth drilling rig as soon as they had the opportunity, never wanting to come back. How could anyone bring out their enthusiasm for production in this way?
    These situations alerted Wang Guoji, and he deeply realized that the captain is the most basic commander in the drilling team, and his own cultivation, style, and ability play a decisive role in whether a drilling rig can complete the tasks assigned by the state.
    However, to transform the atmosphere of this drilling rig and liberate the comrades' enthusiasm for production, did not require much effort for Wang Guoji. Because he is not only a supporter of advanced things, but also a creator of advanced things himself.
    Gradually, on the thirty-ninth drilling rig, like a clear morning after rain, a refreshing breeze came: the Youth Assault Team was established, production efficiency improved, and even the relationship between people became better.
    In the past, the comrades were not united enough. For example, two young squad leaders—Peng Xingyan and Tan Yongfeng—had opinions of each other, looked down on each other, did not cooperate in work, and did not interact in life. Wang Guoji came and built a bridge between them, finding every opportunity to promote their reconciliation. When Peng Xingyan was sick, he mobilized Tan Yongfeng to visit him. When Tan Yongfeng had difficulties, he asked Peng Xingyan to help solve them. ... Soon, they became a close pair of comrades-in-arms.
    In the past, some drilling workers' marital relationships were not harmonious. For example, there were four young Communist Youth League members with the surname Liu on the drilling rig, who all quarreled with their wives at the same time, causing husbands not to go home and wives not to cook, so these four comrades Liu had to sit on the hillside gnawing cold steamed buns and drinking plain water. When Wang Guoji found out, he mobilized the family committee to persuade their wives and organized the Communist Youth League members to get through to the minds of their husbands. From then on, the couples were reconciled and the families were filled with joy.
    In the past, after get off work, the drillers either played around, complained, or went back to the work shed to sleep. After Wang Guoji became the captain, he organized everyone to study and also taught everyone to play the harmonica and sing. After a day of work, they would swim in the summer and play ball in the winter. As long as there were people from the thirty-ninth drilling rig, you could hear them singing their own heroic song:
    "We sing happily,
      In the distant borderland;
      We work selflessly,
      In the beautiful mine; ...............
      With our iron will,
      Through the rock layers, to knock on the door of coal, iron,
    and petroleum!"
    At this time, exciting news came: the thirty-eighth drilling rig of this team created a new record of 535 meters of monthly footage and challenged the brother drilling rigs across the country!
    Please think, what power can stop the assault team members of the thirty-ninth drilling rig from rising up to respond to the challenge?
    In the fierce competition, as a grassroots production commander, Wang Guoji exerted his organizational talent and wisdom, leading his assault team to steadily catch up with the thirty-eighth drilling rig. Last November, he first created the national record of 765.78 meters of monthly footage.
    In order to reward their pioneering spirit, the Central South Geological Bureau specially awarded the thirty-ninth drilling rig the glorious title of "May Fourth Youth" drilling rig, and their captain Wang Guoji was selected to attend the National Congress of Active Builders of Socialism. He met Chairman Mao in Beijing. Following that, he also became a member of the Second National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference.
    In February of this year, at the Second Session of the Second National Committee of the CPPCC, Wang Guoji, on behalf of the entire drilling rig, made a guarantee to Chairman Mao and the people of the country: "In order to find more treasures in our country with its vast land and abundant resources, we must further improve the monthly efficiency and advance towards one thousand meters!"
    In March, after only one month, they practiced their promise, crossed one thousand meters, and advanced towards a higher record!

    跨过一千公尺
    黄悌
    在祖国的南方，活跃在巍峨、秀丽的峰峦之间，有一支出色的地质勘探队——四○四勘探队。
    在这支出色的地质勘探队里，有一台出色的突击钻机，这就是著名的“五四青年号”钻机。这台钻机不仅月月超额完成国家任务，而且连连突破纪录，实现了“向一千公尺进军”的诺言，创造了台月进尺（一台钻机一个月的岩芯进尺）1，090公尺的全国最高纪录。
    这台钻机的机长兼突击队长，是二十三岁的共产党员王国骥。
    1951年，王国骥还是汉口一家私营书店的店员。他已经在这家小书店里工作四年了。俗语说：“近水楼台先得月”，尽管书店老板对他有不少限制，王国骥还是东一本西一本的看了不少书，而他最喜欢看的却是地图——祖国的地图。他一得空，就站在地图的面前，默默地记忆着那些蜿蜒的山脉、曲折的河流、以及那些繁星般的数不尽的城市、县镇……。渐渐的，他产生了一个固执的念头：“离开这个闷人的小书店，到辽阔广大的祖国各地去走走！”
    恰好，就在这一年，中南工业部地质钻探总队在汉口招考钻探工人，王国骥瞒着书店老板，偷偷地报了名。
    考试的时候，出了一道作文题：“你为什么要学习钻探？”这篇文章怎么做呢？总不能说想借此周游各地吧，想着，想着，忽然想起在小学读书的时候（那是解放前好几年的事哩），语文课本上有这么一课：
        “中华，中华！
        五万万人民，
        五千年文化，
        宝藏无穷尽，
        深深埋地下！”
    那时候在他幼小的心灵里就想过：“干吗总深深埋地下？要是挖出来，那可多好！”至于为什么挖不出来，挖出来又怎么样这些他倒没想。如今，又想起这篇课文
  （他记得牢牢的哩），想法可就多起来了。对，就把这些想法写上：“为了把那些深深埋在地下的宝藏挖出来，建设祖国，我要学钻探！”这就是他最初立下的志愿。
    考试结果，王国骥被录取了，从此，他脱离了那个狭小的私营书店，走上了一条崭新的道路。
    他被分配到一个小型的钻探队去工作，当他第一次走进那巨灵似的高大的钻塔，眼看着一根根钻杆
  “忽隆隆”钻进地心去的时候，他的心里是多么激动呵。可是，他仅仅跟了一个班，连钻头怎么会钻进岩石去的道理还没弄明白，队长就把他调到队部去了。话说得很明白：“队上缺少个记账的会计，你在书店里管过几天账，还懂得一些，暂时先代理两天，等调来人，就替换你。”
    可是，一天两天，十天半月，三、四个月都过去了，连个换人的讯息都没有，看样子，会计是当定了。这可把王国骥急坏了，他决定找队长做一次正式的谈话。
    “队长！还是让我回钻机吧，会计，我干不下去。”
      “嗯？还可以嘛！好好干，组织上培养你，将来送你到会计学校去学习。”
      “不，我要学钻探！”
      “你为什么不愿意学会计？会计也是一门很重要的工作，会计……”队长耐心地给他讲解革命的分工，会计工作的意义其及重要性。
    王国骥在听着，他丝毫也没有轻视会计工作的意思，相反的，他非常同意队长对会计工作的评价，可是等队长说完了，他还只是重复着：“让我回钻机，我要学钻探！”
      “你没听懂我的话么？钻机上的活儿有人做，你还是干会计吧！”队长的话已经带着决定的语气了。
      “队长！……”王国骥的血液往脸上一涌，好像有一肚子的话要往外说似的，可是，憋了一下，却直楞楞地说出这么一句话：“要干会计，我还不到钻探队上来哩！”
    “嗯？”队长觉出来他在顶撞，原想批评他两句，可是看着这个满脸涨得通红的小伙子，又觉得他火辣辣的，性格执拗得可爱，就没说出口，只是说：“这问题以后再谈吧，等队部研究好了，再答复你。”
    不久，王国骥被调到中南工业部主办的钻探训练班去学习，学钻探。
    王国骥从钻探训练班毕业以后，立即被分配到钻机上去做班长。
    两、三年来，他和同志们在一起，风里来雨里去，跋涉过不少美丽的山河，无数次地把钻杆探进大地，去揭开地下宝藏的隐秘。随着整个地质事业的壮大成长，王国骥也逐渐地成长为一个优秀的钻探技工，成为四○四勘探队先进的钻机班长和副机长。由于他改进了“合金钻头”，提高了生产效率，已经多次受过奖励。
    1955年6月，有一天，王国骥得到了队部的通知：派他担任三十九号钻机的机长。
    三十九号钻机是队上出了名的
  “麻烦”钻机，不仅效率低，常常完不成任务，而且质量也常不合地质上的要求，往往因此造成严重的返工浪费。所以，谁提起来都摇头：“他们呀，在我们队算数上第一了，——可倒着数。”
    当然，这些情况王国骥也是知道的，虽说他是头一次当机长，可他并没发愁，因为他有这么个体会：困难越多，越能锻炼人，跟困难作战，并且战胜它，这倒挺适合他的性格。
    然而，作战首先必须掌握敌情，三十九号钻机的关键问题在哪里呢？譬如说，“孔斜现象”，这是钻探上一个直接影响质量的问题，为什么别人都能预防，而偏偏三十九号钻机做不到呢？难道说是同志们的技术水平低吗？为了弄清这个问题，王国骥决定在开孔前召集大家开会，以“怎样预防并消灭孔斜现象？”为题，让同志们讨论。
    讨论结果，证明大家的技术水平并不比别人低，综合会上的意见，采取相应的技术措施，是足以消灭过去层出不穷的“孔斜现象”的。
    这反而使王国骥感到奇怪了，他问大家：“你们为什么不早开个会研究呢？”
      “开会？谁召集呀？你不是刚调来么！”一个小伙子翻了翻眼，嘟嚷着。
      “咦，以前那位机长呢？他……”
      “别提他啦，听说把他调走，我们都想着开晚会哩。”
    “嘿，得给他编个节目！……”钻工们开始活跃起来。
      “怎么？”王国骥想问个仔细，但已经到开钻的时间了。大家纷纷走进钻塔，这次，王国骥亲自掌握“给进把”开孔，并且一连跟了好几个班，帮助钻工们实现了会上提出的技术措施。从此，“孔斜现象”在三十九号钻机的钻杆下被消灭了。
    在亲自跟班当中，王国骥逐渐摸清了这台钻机的底细。他领悟了这台钻机所以落后的关键，不在于设备，也不在于技术条件，而在于机长的领导。
    原来，那位前任机长虽然是个老技工，可为人狭隘、保守而且不相信群众。譬如说，为了提高钻进效率，有人向他提出要加大压力，加快速度。他连忙说：“这可不行，机器扛不了，要是出了事故，这责任是你负呀，还是我负？”如果你说：“人家都这么干了，进尺进的可快哩。”他就会这样回答：
  “你光看着那进尺快的啦，你怎么就不瞧瞧那卡钻、断钻杆的？”如果你再提意见，他就该说啦：“我学钻探那会儿，还没有你哩，你把眼面前这些活儿都学会了，再翻新的吧！”有的小伙子，譬如周大早、彭兴焱这几个青年班长，气不过，就瞒着他偷偷的干。万一让他发现，不管收效如何，一律扣上顶无组织无纪律的帽子。因此，有人整天跟他提意见，辩论，呕气，有人就不声不响地打主意，一有机会就离开这三十九号，再也不想回来了。如此这般，谁还能发挥出生产的积极性呢？
    这些情况，使王国骥得到警惕，他深深地体会到：机长，是钻探队伍中最基层的指挥员，他本身的修养、作风和能力，对一台钻机能否完成国家交付的任务，起着决定性的作用。
    不过，要转换这台钻机的空气，解放同志们的生产积极性，对于王国骥说来，却并不需要经过多少曲折。因为，他不仅是先进事物的支持者，而且他本身就是先进事物的创造者。
    逐渐的，在三十九号钻机，像雨后的清晨一样，拂来一阵阵沁人心脾的清风：青年突击队成立了，生产效率提高了，连人与人之间的关系也变得美好了。
    从前，同志们之间是不够团结的，例如：两个青年班长——彭兴焱与谭永凤，互相有意见，互相看不起，工作上不合作，生活上不来往。王国骥来了，在他们之间建立了一道桥梁，找一切机会促使他们和解，当彭兴焱生病的时候，就动员谭永凤去探病，谭永凤有困难，就让彭兴焱去帮助解决。……不久，他们就成为一对亲密的战友。
    从前，有些钻工的夫妻关系是不和美的，例如：钻机上有四个姓刘的青年团员，都在同一时期内和自己的老婆吵架，闹得丈夫不回家，妻子不做饭，使这四位刘同志只得坐在山坡上啃冷馒头，喝白开水。王国骥知道了，就动员家属委员会去说服他们的妻子，组织青年团员们去打通她们的丈夫的思想。从此，夫妻们重新和好，家庭喜气洋洋。
    从前，钻工们下班以后，不是打打闹闹，就是发发牢骚，再不然就回到工棚里蒙头睡大觉。王国骥当了机长以后，组织大家学习，还教会大家吹口琴唱歌。一天劳动完了，夏天游泳，冬天打球，只要有三十九号钻机的人，就能听见他们唱着自己豪迈的歌：
    “我们愉快的歌唱，
      在遥远的边疆；
      我们忘我的劳动，
      在美丽的矿山；……………………
      用我们钢铁的意志，
      穿过岩层，去敲开煤、铁、
    石油的家门！”
    就在这个时候，传来一个令人激动的消息，本队三十八号钻机创造了台月进尺535公尺的新纪录，并向全国兄弟钻机挑战！
    请想想看，还有什么力量能阻挡住三十九号钻机的突击队员们奋起应战呢？
    在炽烈的竞赛中，作为一个基层的生产指挥员，王国骥发挥了他的组织才能和智慧，带领着他的突击队稳步地赶上了三十八号钻机。去年十一月，首先创造了台月进尺765.78公尺的全国最高纪录。
    为了奖励他们这种首创精神，中南地质局特授予三十九号钻机以
  “五四青年号”钻机的光荣称号，他们的机长王国骥被选出席全国青年社会主义建设积极分子大会，他到北京见到了毛主席。随着，他又成为中国人民政治协商会议第二届全国委员会的委员。
    今年二月，在政协第二届全国委员会第二次全体会议上，王国骥代表全钻机，向毛主席和全国人民提出了保证：“为了在我们地大物博、资源丰富的祖国里寻找更多的宝藏，我们要进一步提高台月效率，向一千公尺进军！”
    三月，仅仅经过一个月，他们就实践了诺言，跨过了一千公尺，向更高的纪录前进！
