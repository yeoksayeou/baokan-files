Tobacco Leaves from the Sky

The Cangzhen Tobacco and Wine Company in Cangxian County, Hebei Province, received 4,127 jin of tobacco leaves transferred from Tianjin in early May. However, this batch of goods did not have a price allocation order. Although tobacco leaves were out of stock in the market, they could not be sold because there was no price. Why didn't this batch of goods have a price allocation order? Inquiries were made to the county, the special zone, and even the Hebei Provincial Agricultural Products Purchasing Bureau, and a new problem emerged: no one knew where this batch of goods came from.

    从天而降的烟叶
    河北沧县沧镇烟酒公司在五月初接到由天津转调来烟叶4，127斤，但是这批货物没有价格调拨单；烟叶市场虽然脱销，但因为没有价格就不得销售。这批货为什么没有价格调拨单？经向县、专区直到河北省农产品采购局查询，却问出了新的问题，原来没有人知道这批货是从哪里调来的。　（谦文）
