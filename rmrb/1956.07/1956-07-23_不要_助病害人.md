    Don't "Help Disease Harm People"
    The various pills, powders, creams, and plasters produced by the "Hulunbuir League Pharmaceutical Factory" in Zhalantun, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, frequently have instances of incorrect packaging and wrong formulations. On June 28th, the Tongfahe Pharmacy in Zhalantun sold a bag of "Qingfei Powder" (Lung Cleansing Powder), which upon inspection, was confirmed to be "Taohua Powder" (Peach Blossom Powder).  Niu Huang Qingxin Pills (Bezoar Heart-Clearing Pills), Niu Huang Shangqing Pills (Bezoar Upper Clearing Pills), Niu Huang Baolong Pills (Bezoar Protect the Dragon Pills) and other pills, because of insufficient honey, are all as hard as iron. The pills coated with wax paper become moldy and deteriorate over time due to unclean water, resulting in ineffectiveness at best and toxicity at worst.
    Medicines are for "treating illnesses and saving lives." It is hoped that the factory's staff comrades, especially the leading comrades, will produce and package medicines with the utmost sense of responsibility, and not allow medicines to become things that "help disease harm people."

### 不要“助病害人”

    不要“助病害人”
    内蒙古自治区扎兰屯“呼伦贝尔盟制药厂”生产的各种丸散膏丹，经常有装错和配错的现象。六月二十八日扎兰屯同发和药店售出一袋“清肺散”，经检查证实是“桃花散”。牛黄清心丸、牛黄上清丸、牛黄抱龙丸等丸药，因为用蜜少，都硬得像铁。挂蜡皮的丸药，因为水不清净，日子一长，就发霉变质，轻则失效，重则生毒。
    药品是“治病救人”的。希望这个工厂的职工同志们，特别是领导同志，要以最大的责任心来生产和包装药品，不要使药品成为“助病害人”的东西。　申龙
