Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, July 16th: A 75-horsepower tugboat conducted a trial voyage yesterday on the upper reaches of the Foziling Reservoir. This tugboat, adorned with a portrait of Chairman Mao and decorated with colored flags and pine branches, towed a wooden barge behind it. The tugboat and barge carried more than 300 workers, farmers, and other personnel participating in the trial voyage ceremony.

The tugboat slowly proceeded towards Guanjia Ferry, more than 20 li away from Foziling. The mountains on both banks were steep, covered with verdant pines and cypresses. The boat traveling on the water was like entering a painting.

The transport on the Pi River, a tributary of the Huai River, was extremely inconvenient, especially above Foziling. In the past, the current was rapid during the flood season, and after the flood season, the water was shallow and there were many shoals. Not only could steamboats not navigate, but even wooden sailing boats could not sail, only bamboo rafts pulled by people that drew very little water could travel. After the completion of the Foziling Reservoir, the reservoir was filled with water, which created conditions for steamboats to navigate above Foziling. The navigation of steamboats above Foziling is of great significance for transportation in the mountainous areas and for supporting the Mozitan Reservoir project, which is currently under construction.

### 佛子岭水库上游试航

    佛子岭水库上游试航
    新华社合肥16日电　一只七十五匹马力的拖轮，昨天在佛子岭水库上游试航。这只挂着毛主席像、扎着彩旗松柏的拖轮，后面拖带着一只木驳船。在拖轮和木驳船上载着三百多名工人、农民和其他参加试航典礼人员。
    拖船缓缓向距佛子岭二十多里的管驾渡前进。两岸丛山峻岭，苍松翠柏，船行水上，如入画中。
    淮河支流的淠河，交通运输非常不便，特别在佛子岭以上，过去汛期水流湍急，汛期过后，水浅滩多，不仅不能行驶轮船，连木帆船也无法航行，只能行驶用人拉的吃水很浅的竹筏。佛子岭水库建成以后，水库里蓄满了水，这就为佛子岭以上航行轮船创造了条件。佛子岭以上航行轮船，对山区的交通运输和支援正在兴建的磨子潭水库工程具有重大意义。
