    A Good Way to Solve the Problem of Pocket Money for Commune Members
    Fu Sheng
    The agricultural production cooperatives in Wuyuan County, Jiangxi Province, have implemented a system of monthly advance payments based on labor days to solve the problem of the daily lack of pocket money for commune members. This method is based on a monthly advance payment according to the number of labor days earned by each commune member, with more advance payments for more labor and less for less labor. In special circumstances, more can be advanced with the approval of the cooperative committee. The amount of advance payment is determined based on the different circumstances of each cooperative, such as the amount of regular income and the amount of savings. Generally, the amount of advance payment per labor day should not exceed half of the remuneration earned per labor day. For example, if one labor day can be divided into 1.5 yuan based on the annual production plan, then the advance payment is 0.7 yuan. Cooperatives with less regular income have lower advance payment standards. Some cooperatives advance 10% of the labor day remuneration, and each commune member can only advance 3 or 4 yuan per month, but this is already enough to solve the problem of commune members buying oil, salt, and other pocket money items.
    Before the implementation of this method, some cooperatives adopted the method of "whoever lacks borrows, borrows as needed" to temporarily pay part of the income from sideline production to commune members. Because this method was unplanned, it was difficult to control borrowing, often resulting in more labor borrowing less, less labor borrowing more; those who do not lack money borrow it, and those who really lack money do not get it, and other unreasonable phenomena. This not only cannot reflect the distribution principle of "to each according to his work, more pay for more work" and improve the production enthusiasm of commune members, but also easily causes chaos in financial management.
    In March of this year, the Wuyuan County Committee of the Communist Party of China conducted a trial implementation of the planned monthly advance payment method in the Zhongyun and Baishiyuan cooperatives, which achieved good results. This method was then promoted throughout the county; currently, 20 of the county's 76 advanced cooperatives have implemented this method.
    There are many benefits to implementing monthly advance payments based on labor:
    First, it can stimulate the production enthusiasm of commune members and increase labor attendance. For example, after three forestry cooperatives in Tuanjie Township implemented advance payments, commune members, regardless of men or women, whole or half labor force, all competed to participate in production. The attendance rate of male labor is generally 98%-99%, and the attendance rate of female labor is also over 90%.
    Second, it can promote cooperatives to expand their business scope and increase sideline income. Many cooperatives that originally had low sideline income have actively sought production avenues and expanded sideline income in order to ensure the realization of the advance payment plan. For example, the Fuchun cooperative extracted a part of the surplus labor force to engage in coal mining, lime burning, food processing for the grain department, and transportation for the supply and marketing cooperative. In ten days, the income from transportation fees alone was more than 1,000 yuan.
    Third, it strengthens the financial management work of the cooperative. Because monthly advance payments are to be implemented, the accountant must clearly settle how much income, how much expenditure, and how many work points each household and commune member has each month. In this way, problems such as omissions and errors can be discovered and corrected in time, so that problems do not accumulate and become difficult to clear.

    解决社员零花钱的一个好办法
    傅生
    江西省婺源县农业生产合作社实行按月按劳动日预支的办法，解决社员日常缺乏零花钱的问题。这个办法是根据每个社员每月所得的劳动日数按月进行一次预支，多劳多支，少劳少支。有特殊情况的经社委研究批准可以多支。预支钱数多少根据各社经常性的收入多少和存款多少等不同情况来确定。一般的每个劳动日预支的款数以不超过每个劳动日应得报酬数量的一半为标准。如根据全年生产计划，一个劳动日可分一元五角，则预支为七角。经常性收入较少的社，预支标准较低。有的社预支劳动日报酬的10％，每月每个社员只能支三、四元钱，但已经能够解决社员买油盐等零用钱的问题。
    在实行这个办法以前，有些合作社采取“谁缺谁借、随用随借”的办法把部分副业生产收入临时支给社员。由于这种办法没有计划，对借支不易掌握，往往造成劳动多的借得少，劳动少的借得多；不缺钱的借去了，真正缺钱的没借到等不合理现象。这样不但不能体现“按劳取酬、多劳多得”的分配原则，提高社员生产积极性，而且容易引起财务管理工作的混乱。
    今年三月间中共婺源县委在中云、白石沅二个社试行了有计划地按月按劳预支办法，取得了良好的效果，接着就在全县范围内推广了这个办法；目前全县七十六个高级社，已有二十个社实行了这个办法。
    实行按月按劳预支好处很多：
    首先是能激发社员的生产积极性，提高劳动出勤率。如团结乡三个林业社实行预支以后，社员无论男女整半劳动力，凡能参加生产的人都争着参加生产。男劳动力出勤率一般均达到98％—99％，女劳动力出勤率也达到90％以上。
    其次是能促进合作社扩大经营范围，增加副业收入。不少原来副业收入少的社，为了保证预支计划的实现，都积极寻找生产门路，扩大副业收入。如赋春社抽出一部分剩余劳动力从事挖煤炭、烧石灰、给粮食部门进行粮食加工、替供销社运输等，在十天内光运输费就收入一千多元。
    第三是加强了合作社的财务管理工作。因为要实行按月预支，会计必须将每月收入多少、支出多少、各户社员工分多少都结算清楚。这样有漏账、错账等问题能及时发现与纠正，不致让问题成堆，不易清理。
