Xinhua News Agency, 20th -- The head of the State Council's Eighth Office today addressed Xinhua reporters on two issues: the return of funds increased by private industrialists and merchants during the peak of the full joint state-private ownership movement, and the review of property inventory during the period of joint state-private ownership.

The head of the office said that during the peak of the full joint state-private ownership movement in private industry and commerce at the beginning of this year, many private industrialists and merchants voluntarily increased their investment, but there were instances of mobilized capital increases. Increasing investment during or after the full joint ownership was originally a patriotic action in support of socialism, but mobilizing capital increases easily leads to bad results. The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China issued instructions three times, on January 24th, April 28th, and June 4th, to stop this practice, and pointed out that except for capital increases by capitalists before the peak of full joint state-private ownership and capital increases by capitalists using their original advances in the enterprise, all other capital increases, whether in cash or in kind, during the peak period should be returned. If some materials cannot be returned due to reasonable production needs or have already been used, they should be returned at a depreciated value. The State Council, in its reply to a telegram from the Guizhou Provincial People's Committee on July 5, instructed: "The increased investment in joint state-private enterprises by capitalist industrialists and merchants, small business owners, small vendors, and individual laborers during the peak period (except for capital increases by capitalists using their original advances in the enterprise) should be resolutely and fully returned, regardless of whether the individual is experiencing financial difficulties or not, and whether it is in cash or in kind. Only in individual cases where industrialists and merchants, after being clearly informed of the policy of returning the increased investment, still insist on not returning it, can their request be accepted with the approval of the relevant departments."

The head of the office then spoke about the review of property inventory during the period of joint state-private ownership. He said that the State Council issued an instruction on April 28 regarding the review of property inventory for joint state-private ownership, which stated: "After private enterprises implement full-industry joint state-private ownership, the inventory and valuation of enterprise property generally takes the form of self-assessment and self-reporting by capitalists, and mutual evaluation by the industry. The work has generally progressed smoothly. However, based on the situation in various regions, there is generally a phenomenon of underestimation. The reasons for the underestimation are mainly that capitalists are actively expressing themselves and deliberately lowering the value, and some are harboring doubts, preferring to be low rather than high; secondly, there is mutual squeezing during industry mutual evaluation; and when employees and cadres assist in supervision, they are afraid that the state will suffer losses, so they are grasping more tightly." This instruction further pointed out: "Carrying out inventory and valuation of enterprises and determining the private share is an important task for the state in handling the means of production of the bourgeoisie, and it should be handled realistically, fairly, and reasonably as much as possible. Therefore, if the work of inventory and valuation of capitalists' property has not yet ended, the above-mentioned established policy should be resolutely implemented. If it has already ended, a focused review should be conducted based on the specific situation. In the local area, first identify several industries with more prominent problems that need to be adjusted, deeply understand the situation, find out the problems, and correct them; then, adjustments should be made to other industries that need to be adjusted."

The head of the office said that enterprises throughout the country that implemented joint state-private ownership this year have entered the stage of property inventory and are preparing to issue fixed interest for the first half of the year in July and August. In order to do a good job in the asset verification work, these instructions must continue to be implemented.

    国务院第八办公室负责人宣布
    退还全面合营期间资本家所增投资
    对资本家财产的清理估价工作将进行复查
    新华社20日讯　国务院第八办公室负责人今天就退回在全面公私合营高潮期间私营工商业者增加的资金、对公私合营时的清产核资进行复查等两个问题。对新华社记者发表谈话。
    负责人说，在今年年初各地私营工商业实行全面公私合营的高潮期间，不少私营工商业者主动增加投资，但其中发生动员增资现象。在全面合营期间或者以后增加投资，这本来是一种拥护社会主义的爱国行动，但是动员增资容易引起不好的结果。中共中央曾经于一月二十四日、四月二十八日、六月四日三次发出指示，制止这种做法，并指出除全面公私合营高潮以前资本家的增资及资本家以原来在企业的垫款增资的以外，其他不论以现金实物在高潮中的增资，应当一律退还。其中有些实物如果由于生产的合理需要或者已经使用而不能退还时，应当折价退还。国务院于七月五日批复贵州省人民委员会电报中指示：“对资本主义工商业者、小业主、小商贩、个体劳动者在高潮中对公私合营企业的增资（除资本家以原来在企业的垫款增资的以外）应当坚决全部退还，不论本人生活困难或者不困难，都应当主动退还，不论是现金或者其他实物，都一律退还。只有个别工商业者在明确告以退还增资的政策后，仍然坚持要求不退还的，经主管部门审核批准，才可以接受他们的要求。”
    负责人接着谈到对公私合营时的清产核资进行复查的问题。他说，国务院曾于四月二十八日对公私合营的清产核资进行复查工作发出过一个指示，这个指示中说：“私营企业实行全行业公私合营以后，对企业财产的清理估价，各地大体上采取资本家自估，自报，同业互评等方式，工作一般进行得很顺利。但根据各地情况，一般有偏低现象。造成偏低的原因，主要是资本家表示积极，故意压低，也有的心存疑虑，宁低勿高；其次是同业互评时，彼此挤压；而职工、干部在协助监督时，怕国家吃亏，抓得比较紧。”这个指示还进一步指出：“对企业进行清理估价，确定私方股额是国家处理资产阶级的生产资料的一项重要工作，应该实事求是，公平合理地处理，尽量了结。因此，各地对资本家的财产清理估价工作，如果尚未结束，应该坚决贯彻上述既定的方针，如果已经结束，应当根据具体情况，有重点地进行一次复查。在当地，先找出问题较为突出需要加以调整的若干行业，深入了解情况，摸清问题所在，加以改正；然后，对其他行业需要加以调整的，都应加以调整。
    负责人说，全国在今年实行公私合营的企业，都已进入清产核资阶段，并且准备在七、八月份发给上半年定息，为了做好核资工作，对以上这些指示必须继续加以贯彻。
