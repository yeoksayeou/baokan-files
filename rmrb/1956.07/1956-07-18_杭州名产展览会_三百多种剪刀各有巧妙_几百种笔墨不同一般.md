Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, July 15th: More than 30,000 people visited the Hangzhou-produced scissors, brushes, ink, and eyeglasses exhibition that closed today in Hangzhou. The exhibition opened on July 1st.

The scissors section of the exhibition showcased 310 kinds of Hangzhou-produced scissors used in industry, agriculture, medical care, tailoring, and daily life. These scissors all have their own characteristics according to their different uses. For example, the machine scissors used by silk factory workers to repair silk surfaces have a circular, elastic handle, making them small and lightweight, and they can be hung on the ear when not in use. The craft scissors for elementary school students have rounded tips, which are safer for beginners and won't poke holes in their schoolbags. Hangzhou scissors have a production history of more than 300 years. Zhang Xiaoquan scissors from Hangzhou, which are popular domestically and have received international acclaim, also have a history of more than 100 years. This year, the Hangzhou Rural Visiting Work Group discovered a pair of Hangzhou scissors from thirty years ago in Qicun, Kaiyuan Township, Yuyao County, Zhejiang Province, which is still usable today. Before liberation, the highest annual output of Hangzhou scissors reached 1.6 million pairs. Later, due to commercial capitalists buying at low prices and selling at high prices, and cutting prices in the off-season, the scissors handicraft industry could not maintain production due to lack of profit. By the time of Hangzhou's liberation in 1949, the annual output was only 400,000 pairs. After liberation, with the support of the People's Government, the output of Hangzhou scissors has increased year by year. This year, it is expected to reach 4 million pairs, more than double the highest annual output before liberation. After the joint state-private ownership of the scissors industry in the first quarter of this year, not only has the quality of the scissors improved, but also some varieties that had been discontinued for many years have been restored to production. The twenty-one kinds of famous scissors on display at the exhibition, such as chrome-plated and white rattan-wrapped scissors, have only recently been restored to production. There were also eighteen new varieties of scissors on display at the exhibition that had never been produced before.

Another part of the exhibition displayed 222 kinds of writing brushes and 246 kinds of ink. Exquisitely carved gift inks are elegant gifts that literati have given to each other throughout the ages. They have unique shapes, mostly imitating ancient bells, drums, zithers, coins, balances, or measuring instruments. Some gift inks are also carved with beautiful landscapes such as Huangshan in Anhui and the Ten Scenes of West Lake in Hangzhou. Good gift inks are made with high-quality domestic soot and contain musk and borneol. When ground on an inkstone, they emit a clear fragrance. When written on paper, the ink color can remain unchanged for thousands of years. A Hangzhou-produced goat-hair brush displayed in a brocade box at the exhibition has been used for ninety-two years. This brush is still not moth-eaten or rotten, and it still writes smoothly. Hangzhou-produced writing brushes have historically enjoyed a reputation in Southeast Asia. Exports will be resumed in the third quarter of this year, with the first batch including more than 44,000 brushes for painting orchids and bamboos, as well as brushes for general writing.

The exhibition also displayed 179 kinds of eyeglasses manufactured in Hangzhou.

### 杭州名产展览会  三百多种剪刀各有巧妙　几百种笔墨不同一般

    杭州名产展览会
    三百多种剪刀各有巧妙　几百种笔墨不同一般
    据新华社杭州15日电　有三万多人参观了今天在杭州闭幕的杭产剪刀、笔、墨、眼镜展览会。展览会是在七月一日开幕的。
    展览会的剪刀部分，展出了工业、农业、医务、裁衣和日常生活所用的三百一十种杭产剪刀。这些剪刀都根据不同的使用对象而各具特点。例如供绸厂工人修理绸面用的机剪，剪脚是一个圆环，有弹性，小巧轻便，不用的时候可以挂在耳朵上。给小学生用的劳作剪，剪头是圆的，对于初学使用剪刀的小学生来说，比较安全，放在书包里也不致把书包戳破。杭州剪刀已经有三百多年的生产历史。畅销国内并且在国际上得到好评的杭州张小泉剪刀也已经有一百多年的历史了。今年，杭州市农村访问工作团在浙江省余姚县开元乡七村曾经发现一把三十年前的杭剪，至今还可以使用。解放以前，杭州剪刀最高年产量曾经达到一百六十万把。后来，由于商业资本家低价收购，高价出售，淡季杀价，使剪刀手工业因无利可图而不能维持生产，到1949年杭州解放时，年产量只有四十万把了。解放以后，在人民政府的扶植下，杭州剪刀产量逐年增加，今年预计可达四百万把，超过解放以前最高年产量的一倍以上。今年第一季度剪刀业公私合营以后，不仅剪刀质量有了提高，而且一些中断多年的品种也已经恢复生产。展览会上陈列的镀克罗米、扎白藤等二十一种名剪，就是最近才恢复生产的。展览会上还有十八种过去从未生产过的新品种剪刀。
    展览会的另一部分展出了二百二十二种毛笔和二百四十六种墨。雕刻精细的礼品墨，是历代文人互相馈赠的高雅礼物，形状别致，大多模仿古时的钟、鼓、琴、钱币、衡器或量器等，有的礼品墨上还雕刻着徽州黄山、杭州西湖十景等秀丽的山水。好的礼品墨用上等的国产本烟制成，里面放有麝香、艾片，磨在砚上，清香四溢，写在纸上，可以保留几千年而墨色不变。展览会上一枝被装置在锦匣中的杭产羊毫笔，已经使用了九十二年。这枝笔到现在一点不蛀不烂，写起来仍很流利。杭产毛笔历史上在南洋一带享有声誉，今年第三季度将重新恢复出口，第一批出口的有：专画兰、竹的画笔和一般写字用笔共四万四千多枝。
    展览会还展出了杭州市制造的一百七十九种眼镜。
