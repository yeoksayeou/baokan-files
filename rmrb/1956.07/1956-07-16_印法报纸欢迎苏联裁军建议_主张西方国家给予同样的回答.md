Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, July 14th: Today's "Hindustan Times" wrote in an editorial that Soviet representative Gromyko's statement at the United Nations Disarmament Committee meeting, expressing readiness to accept the Western proposals on the level of armed forces, "provides the greatest encouragement for disarmament." The editorial said: "This action will greatly help to break the deadlock in the Disarmament Committee."
    "Indian Express" welcomed the Soviet statement, considering it a "valuable contribution." The newspaper said: "Now that Russia has accepted the Western proposals regarding conventional armaments limitations, it should now be the latter's turn to accept the proposals on banning nuclear tests and nuclear bombs."
    "The Times of India" believes: "The Soviet action reflects 'the increasingly clear desire of people everywhere to obtain even partial agreements on thermonuclear and arms supervision.'"
    Xinhua News Agency, according to TASS, Paris, July 14th: Parisian newspapers reported prominently on the speech of Gromyko, the Soviet representative to the United Nations Disarmament Committee meeting, on the 12th.
    "Liberation" believes that the Soviet Union has moved one step closer to the Western countries' proposals, and the Western countries should give the same response.
    "Liberation" wrote, "The more we wait, the more disarmament becomes an intractable problem… the public will not agree to this situation: when suggestions that can be realized have already been put forward, to then abandon them. The public will not agree to using 'preconditions' such as the restoration of German unification as an excuse to evade negotiations…"

    新华社新德里14日电　今天的“印度斯坦时报”在社论中写道，苏联代表葛罗米柯在联合国裁军委员会会议上发表准备接受西方建议的武装部队水平的声明，“对裁减军备提供了最大的鼓舞力量”。社论说：“这个行动将大大有助于打破裁军委员会里的僵局。”
    “印度快报”欢迎苏联的声明，认为这是“可贵的贡献”。这家报纸说：“既然俄国已经接受了西方提出的关于常规军备的限制，现在应该由后者来接受关于禁止核子试验和核子弹的建议了。”
    “印度时报”认为：“苏联的这个行动反映“各地人民越来越明确地希望获得关于热核子和军备监督的即使是部分的协议”。
    新华社据塔斯社巴黎14日讯巴黎报纸以显著地位报道苏联出席联合国裁军委员会会议的代表葛罗米柯在十二日会议上的发言。
    “解放报”认为，苏联向西方国家的建议又靠近了一步，西方国家也应该给予同样的回答。
    “解放报”写道，“越是等待，裁军越加变成难以解决的问题，……公众不会同意这种情况：当已经提出的建议可以实现的时候，又放弃它。公众不会同意，提出像恢复德国统一之类的“先决条件”作为借口，来规避谈判……”
