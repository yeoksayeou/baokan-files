	Reactions to Criticism
	A letter from the Hebei Provincial Department of Industry: The "Reader's Letters" column on April 1st published criticism of the substandard products of the Shijiazhuang Vegetable Oil Factory. After our inspection, this criticism is correct. In the past, the leaders of the Shijiazhuang Vegetable Oil Factory had capitalist management ideas that neglected product quality and were complacent, failing to rely on and mobilize the masses to improve product quality; we also failed to conduct quality inspections of the factory. Recently, we convened a technical professional meeting of all machine oil pressing factories in the province to study measures to improve quality; and we have begun to conduct quality inspections of the oil factories in Shijiazhuang, Baoding, and Zhangjiakou, and are earnestly helping them improve their work.
	A letter from the Kailuan Coal Mine General Administration: The "Reader's Letters" column on April 30th criticized the error of our mine supplying inferior quality coal to Qixin Cement Factory. We humbly accept this criticism and have taken some specific measures to improve our work. Now the quality of each grade of coal from our mine has reached the national quality standards.
	A letter from the Tianjin No. 1 Machine Factory: The Beijing Brick and Tile Factory criticized the poor quality of the vacuum brick making machine produced by our factory in the People's Daily on May 20th. Our factory accepts this criticism and has sent people to repair the machines with poor quality.

    对批评的反应
    河北省工业厅来信：四月一日“读者来信专页”发表了对石家庄植物油厂产品不合规格的批评。经过我们检查，这个批评是正确的。过去石家庄植物油厂领导人员有着忽视产品质量的资本主义经营思想和骄傲自满情绪，没有依靠和发动群众提高产品质量；我们对工厂也没有进行质量检查工作。最近我们召开了全省各机器榨油厂的技术专业会议，研究改进质量的措施；并且着手对石家庄、保定、张家口各油厂进行质量检查，切实帮助他们改进工作。
    开滦煤矿总管理处来信：四月三十日“读者来信专页”批评了我矿供应启新水泥厂的煤炭质量低劣的错误。我们虚心接受这一批评，已经采取了一些具体措施来改进工作。现在我矿各级煤的质量已经达到国家质量指标。
    天津市第一机器厂来信：北京市砖瓦厂在五月二十日人民日报上批评我厂出产的真空制砖机质量不好。我厂接受这个批评，已派人负责修理质量不好的机器。
