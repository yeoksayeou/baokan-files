Xinhua News Agency, Montevideo, July 13th (TASS dispatch) – The Brazilian newspaper "People's Daily" published a speech by Luís Carlos Prestes, General Secretary of the Communist Party of Brazil, regarding the current political situation in Brazil. This speech illustrates the growing strength of political forces within Brazil that are defending national sovereignty and opposing the surrender of the country's natural resources to American monopoly capital.

Prestes pointed out that the development of democratic forces in Brazil reflects the people's hatred of American oppression. This development is meeting resistance from reactionaries who are attempting to hinder the unity of Brazilian democratic forces and establish a system of terror.

Referring to the recent measures taken by the government against the workers' movement and the patriotic movement, Prestes pointed out that the government's banning of the dockworkers' union and the National Liberation Alliance is a threat to democratic freedom and national sovereignty.

Prestes went on to point out that President Kubitschek has adopted a bad approach, setting himself against the broad and powerful forces that elected him president. He is wrong if he thinks that he can solve the serious problems of concern to the people by using police to suppress the working people and transferring oil and other national wealth to monopoly capital.

Prestes said that the basic task at present is to unite the broad democratic and patriotic forces under the slogans of fighting for democratic freedom, amnesty for political prisoners, defending national sovereignty, striving for measures to curb rising prices, and striving to maintain friendly relations with all countries.

    普列斯特斯指出
    巴西人民痛恨美国压迫
    民主爱国力量日益壮大
    新华社14日讯　据塔斯社蒙得维的亚十三日讯：巴西“人民报”刊登了巴西共产党总书记路易斯·卡洛斯·普列斯特斯关于巴西当前政局的谈话，这个谈话说明巴西国内维护国家主权、反对把国家天然富源交给美国垄断资本的政治力量日益壮大。
    普列斯特斯指出，巴西民主力量的发展反映了人民对美国压迫的仇恨。这种发展遇到反动派的反抗，反动派企图阻碍巴西民主力量的团结，并且建立恐怖制度。
    普列斯特斯谈到最近政府采取的反对工人运动和爱国运动的措施，他指出，政府禁止码头工人工会和民族解放大同盟这样的行动是对民主自由和国家主权的威胁。
    普列斯特斯接着指出，库比契克总统采取了一种不好的方针，他把自己同选他为总统的广泛的强大力量对立起来。如果他以为利用警察镇压劳动人民的方法，把石油和国家的其他民族财富转交给垄断资本，就可以解决人民所关心的严重问题，那他就错了。
    普列斯特斯说，目前的基本任务就是把广大民主爱国力量在为争取民主自由、大赦政治犯、保卫民族主权、争取采取制止物价上涨的措施、争取同一切国家保持友好关系而斗争的口号下团结起来。
