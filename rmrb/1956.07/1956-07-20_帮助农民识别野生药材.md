    Helping Farmers Identify Wild Medicinal Herbs
    Shidi Township in Xiushan County, Sichuan Province, is a mountainous area with wild medicinal herbs growing all over the mountains. In the past, because local farmers lacked experience, they rarely picked them. This year, Zou Shengchu, a cadre from the Shidi Township Supply and Marketing Cooperative, collected medicinal herbs such as Dichroa febrifuga, Evodia rutaecarpa, Arnebia euchroma, black soybeans, and Asparagus lucidus, planting them in small flowerpots. When they grew up, he displayed them to the farmers and explained in detail the names, uses, and harvesting methods of these medicinal herbs. This method was very successful. Now, this supply and marketing cooperative has purchased more than seventy kinds of medicinal herbs.

    帮助农民识别野生药材
    四川省秀山县石堤乡是高山地区，满山遍野都生长着野生药材。过去因为当地农民没有经验，很少去采摘。今年石堤乡供销社的干部邹胜楚采集了常山、吴于、紫草、乌豆、天冬等药材，用小花钵栽起来，等到长大后，把它们展出给农民看，并且向农民详细介绍这些药材的名称、用途和采摘方法等。这种办法很成功，现在，这个供销社已经收购了七十多种药材。
