Xinhua News Agency, 11th July. The Nepalese Kingdom's Minister of Education, Health, and Local Self-Government, Mr. Ba. Sharma, said at a welcome banquet held by Minister of Culture Shen Yanbing today that the Nepalese cultural delegation, crossing the Himalayas to come to China, is here to extend greetings to the old friends of the Nepalese people.

In his welcoming speech, Shen Yanbing praised the great contributions of the Nepalese people in culture, art, philosophy, and other fields, and explained the long-standing friendly relations and cultural exchange history between China and Nepal. Shen Yanbing said that the Chinese monk Faxian arrived in Nepal in 406 AD, and the monk Xuanzang visited Nepal in 635 AD. China and Nepal have had mutual influence in literature, art, and philosophy. Shen Yanbing concluded by saying that among the friends present today are renowned Nepalese professors, historians, economists, writers, poets, artists, and social activists. Shen Yanbing believes that through their visits, not only will mutual understanding and cooperation between the two countries be further enhanced, but also Chinese cultural workers will learn more knowledge and experience from them.

In his enthusiastic speech, delegation leader Sharma said that the warm send-off the delegation received when leaving Kathmandu showed that the profound love and friendly feelings towards the Chinese government and people represented by the delegation came not only from the Nepalese government but also from the Nepalese people.

Delegation leader Sharma said that the task of the Nepalese cultural delegation's visit to China is to introduce Nepalese culture to China and promote cultural relations between the two countries. Delegation leader Sharma guaranteed that he and the members of the delegation would strive to complete these two great tasks. He finally shouted "Long live Nepal-China friendship." At the end of his speech, the audience stood up and applauded and cheered for China-Nepal friendship.

Delegation leader Sharma then presented Minister Shen Yanbing with his own work on history.

The Nepalese guests and their Chinese counterparts had cordial conversations at the banquet and toasted to friendship together.
