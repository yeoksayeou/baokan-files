Fully Develop the Potential of Coastal Industry
Many Factories in Lüda Undertake Technical Transformation and Reconstruction and Expansion

(Our newspaper, Dalian, 15th dispatch) In order to develop the potential of coastal industry and better support inland construction, many factories in Lüda are stepping up technical transformation and reconstruction and expansion.

After several years of recovery and development, the output of many factories in Lüda has increased several times over. In particular, after technical transformation, the machinery industry has changed from being able to only repair and assemble to being a manufacturing industry capable of independently manufacturing locomotives, ships, precision machine tools, industrial and mining vehicles, and various cranes. However, the industrial potential of Lüda is still very large. At present, the equipment utilization rate of the machinery industry is only 73%. The equipment capacity of many factories is still unbalanced, and about 30% of the existing equipment is outdated and backward. On the other hand, past technical transformation work has ignored the mechanization of heavy labor, which has affected the health of workers and hindered the improvement of production efficiency and cost reduction.

Now, many factories are speeding up expansion and reconstruction according to the needs and possible conditions, and in accordance with the requirements of less investment, greater benefits, and quick returns. In order to create conditions for building and repairing large ships, the Dalian Shipyard dispatched several dredgers to dredge the sand and gravel blasted from the seabed to expand the sea embankment wharf. The company's expanded central laboratory and oxygen plant have already started construction; the newly laid gas pipeline for heating in various factories has been completed, which can improve the working conditions of workers and increase production efficiency by two to three times. In order to meet the requirements of mass production of the new 1-5-1 type locomotives, Dalian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Factory has started a large-scale reconstruction and expansion project. After the completion of the project, the locomotive output can be increased three times compared with the present. The reconstruction and expansion project of Dalian Crane Factory is also being stepped up. In the next two years, six workshops and other auxiliary equipment of the factory will be renovated and expanded. After the completion of the project, the annual output tonnage will also be doubled compared with this year.

These reconstruction and expansion projects can all meet the requirements of less investment and greater returns. After the Dalian Insulator Factory realizes the technical transformation plan for the next two years, the main processes of the factory will be changed from manual labor to mechanization. The output in 1958 can be increased by 2.3 times compared with 1955, and the technical transformation investment can be recovered from the profit of increased output in about one year. Although the investment in the reconstruction and expansion of Dalian Crane Factory is very large, it will only take half a year to earn it all back based on this year's output. In the past, the local industry of Lüda only utilized 46% of its equipment capacity due to the limitations of raw materials and sales. With the advent of the upsurge of agricultural cooperation, the supply of agricultural products and the sales of industrial products have been greatly improved, and many industrial products need and may increase production. According to the preliminary calculation of the Lüda Municipal Industrial Bureau, as long as the Lüda Machinery Industry Company invests 3.91 million yuan to expand the operating area and add necessary equipment, the output can be increased by more than one time, and the annual profit can be increased by more than 8 million yuan.

    充分发挥沿海工业的潜力
    旅大许多工厂进行技术改造和改建扩建
    本报大连15日电　为了发挥沿海工业的潜力，更好地支援内地建设，旅大许多工厂正在加紧进行技术改造和进行改建、扩建。
    经过几年来的恢复和发展，旅大许多工厂的产量已经成倍地提高。尤其是机械工业经过技术改造以后，已经从过去只能修修配配，变成了能独立制造机车、轮船、精密机床、工矿车辆和各种起重机的制造工业了。但是，旅大的工业目前仍然有很大的潜力。现在机械工业的设备利用率只达到73％。许多工厂的设备能力还不平衡，现有设备中也有约30％是陈旧落后的。另一方面，过去的技术改造工作忽视了繁重劳动的机械化，这就影响了工人的健康，妨害了生产效率的提高和成本的降低。
    现在，许多工厂正在根据需要和可能的条件，按照投资少、收效大、收效快的要求，加紧进行扩建和改建。大连造船公司为了给建造和修理大型船只创造条件，出动了数只挖泥船淘挖海底爆破出来的砂石，扩建海坝码头。这个公司扩建的中央试验室和氧气厂已经动工了；新铺设的供各厂加热用的煤气管道已经竣工，它可以使工人的劳动条件得到改善，并且能使生产效率提高两三倍。为了适应大批生产1—5—1型新型机车的要求，大连机车车辆制造厂开始了大规模的改建扩建工程。工程完工以后，机车产量可以比现在提高三倍。大连起重机厂的改建扩建工程也在加紧进行。在今明两年内，这个厂将有六个车间和其它附属设备进行改建和扩建。工程完工以后，年产吨数也将比今年提高两倍。
    这些改建扩建工程，都能符合投资少、收益大的要求。大连电瓷厂实现今明两年的技术改造计划以后，这个厂的主要工序都将由手工劳动改为机械化，1958年的产量可以比1955年提高2.3倍，大约在一年左右就可以从增加产量的利润中收回技术改造的投资。大连起重机厂改建和扩建的投资虽然很大，但是按照今年的产量计算，也只需要半年就能全部挣回来。旅大地方工业过去因为原料和销路的限制，设备能力只发挥了46％。随着农业合作化高潮的到来，农产品供应和工业品销售情况有很大改善，许多工业品都需要和可能增加生产。据旅大市工业局初步核算，旅大机械工业公司只要投资391万元用来扩大作业面积和增添必要的设备，就可以使产量提高一倍多，每年的利润可以增加八百多万元。　（毛先智）
