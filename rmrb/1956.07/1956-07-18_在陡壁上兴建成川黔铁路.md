Building the Chengyu Railway on Steep Cliffs
By Our Correspondent Li Ce

    Passengers traveling from Chongqing to Guiyang take a long-distance bus from Haitangxi on the south bank of Chongqing, passing through Qijiang, Songkan, Tongzi, Zunyi, Xifeng, and other places, spending three days in a tiresome journey before arriving in Guiyang. On the way, the Lou Mountain Pass in the Lou Mountain Range rises into the clouds. The Liangfengya highway winds from the top of the mountain to the foot, full of sharp turns, known as the "Seventy-Two Turns." Some sections of the road are carved out of the cliffs on the mountainside, with unfathomable narrow valleys below. One place is called "Hanging Corpse Rock," and as the name suggests, one can imagine the impression its danger leaves on people. For many years, people have been hoping for a railway that would allow them to comfortably complete this journey in a dozen hours. People's wishes will soon be realized. The Chengyu Railway has been started ahead of schedule and is expected to be open to traffic on October 1st next year. At that time, taking a train from Zhanjiang in Guangdong, passing through Guangxi, Guizhou, Sichuan, and Shaanxi, one can reach the northwestern provinces of China, the capital Beijing, and the northeastern provinces.

    Guizhou is a province rich in mineral resources. Mercury and antimony in Tongren, copper in Dading and Weining, and aluminum in Xifeng are all famous. After the Chengyu Railway is completed, the mineral resources along the line and throughout the province can be quickly exploited. The economic and cultural life of all ethnic groups in the province will develop more rapidly. Currently, Sichuan Province supplies Guizhou with salt, requiring more than 1,000 trucks with a carrying capacity of 3.5 tons each month to transport it all. In the future, a few trains will be enough to transport it, which will not only free up trucks to strengthen short-distance transportation but also reduce the freight cost of salt.

    The Chengyu Railway utilizes the existing Qijiang Railway within Sichuan. This section of the railway, from Maoertuo on the banks of the Yangtze River to Ganshuichang on the Sichuan border, only requires partial modifications to the curvature of the line, bridges, and tunnels. The Chengyu Railway Yangtze River Bridge and the location of the Chengyu and Chengyu railway connecting station are also under consideration. Currently, the section from Ganshuichang to Guiyang, with a total length of 340 kilometers, is under construction. The design and construction departments have adopted a rolling operation of surveying, designing, and constructing simultaneously. Currently, the route forty kilometers south of Ganshuichang is under construction. The key project, the Xiaoqing Tunnel, has already started excavating the mountain. The Wujiang River Bridge is undergoing drilling exploration.

    Most of the railway line winds through high mountains more than 2,000 meters above sea level, with nearly 60% of the line needing to be carved out of the steep cliffs on the mountainside. There will be bridge piers sixty meters deep and tunnels three thousand meters long on the line, which is longer than the Qinling Tunnel on the Baoji-Chengdu Railway.

    The surveying and construction of the line presented many difficulties. The "Karst" phenomenon is a significant feature of the line's geology. This is a phenomenon never encountered before in the history of railway construction in China. Anyone who has been to Guilin will inevitably visit the Seven Star Cave. It is an integral part of the "unparalleled" Guilin landscape. The cave is humid, dark, and spacious, with strangely shaped stones, stone gates, stone pillars, and unfathomable abysses. This is because the limestone layer has been dissolved by water, forming strangely shaped "caves," which are called the "Karst" phenomenon in geology. On the Chengyu line, especially in the Liangfengya area, these caves are connected one after another. Looking at the surface, it is hard rock, but drilling a hole reveals that it is empty underneath. Its bearing capacity is very small, and it would naturally be very dangerous to build the roadbed on top of the caves. Therefore, the line must bypass the caves. Surveyors drill into the caves to take measurements.

    Surveying caves is not the same as visiting the scenic Seven Star Cave in Guilin. In the Seven Star Cave, there are guides, and the caves are familiar to the guides, and you are not allowed to go to dangerous areas. However, here, the surveyors are drilling into caves that no one has ever drilled before, and they must measure the size and area of each cave, and they must personally see every place. The surveyors selected young men and organized cave exploration teams. They put on raincoats and rubber shoes, carried short knives to defend against wild animals and venomous snakes, and brought gas lamps, flashlights, and soft ladders made of ropes, as well as surveying instruments. They went inside, where it was pitch black. Wide areas could accommodate two large buildings or a factory, while narrow areas could only accommodate one person crawling through. Some places were humid and hot, while others had howling winds, and sometimes the sound of rushing water could be heard. When encountering deep abysses, flashlight beams did not reflect back, and it took a long time to hear the echo of stones thrown down. People climbed down step by step using soft ladders, sometimes reaching depths of two or three hundred meters.

    Since ancient times, people have used "No three days of sunshine, no three miles of flat ground" to describe Guizhou's foggy and mountainous terrain. Because the mountains along the line are often foggy, surveyors climbed the mountains early in the morning, carrying oil lamps with colored shades to take measurements. In Tiaoyu Cave, there were steep cliffs on both sides, and a turbulent river in the middle. They rowed small boats upstream. People climbed up the cliffs from the boats, with safety ropes tied around their waists, holding onto the surveying instruments.

    Surveying and drilling personnel are constantly creating new experiences and improving work efficiency. The Third Detachment, following the new staffing plan, reduced its personnel by about half and also transferred three engineers. However, they adopted the Soviet Union's advanced experience of "integration of internal and external operations" and continued to work as usual. This advanced experience means that engineers conduct field observations for six hours and then immediately organize the data on the spot for the last two hours, training surveyors to replace the work of engineers. Organizing data on-site allows for on-the-spot verification, ensuring the accuracy of the data, and it also facilitates on-the-spot guidance of surveyors' observations, which is very beneficial for cultivating technical personnel. In the evenings, they returned to their lodgings, saving them from staying up all night organizing data as in the past, allowing them to engage in formal theoretical and professional learning or cultural and recreational activities.

    在陡壁上兴建成川黔铁路
    本报记者　李策
    从重庆去贵阳的旅客，在重庆南岸海棠溪坐上长途汽车，经过綦江、松坎、桐梓、遵义、息烽等地，度过三天烦闷的旅途生活，才到贵阳。途中娄山山脉上的娄山关，高入云际。凉风垭的公路从山顶到山脚，曲曲折折尽是急弯，号称“七十二道拐”。有几段公路是从山腰的悬岩上开凿出来的，下边是深不可测的狭谷，有个地方叫“吊尸岩”，顾名思义，可见它的艰险程度给人们留下的是什么印象。多少年来，人们盼望有条铁路、用十几个钟头舒服地走完这段旅程，人们的愿望不久就要实现了。川黔铁路已经提前兴建，预计明年十月一日可以通车。那时候，从广东的湛江坐上火车，经过广西、贵州、四川、陕西，可以到我国西北各省，可以到首都北京，也可以到东北各省。
    贵州是个矿产丰富的省份。铜仁的汞和锑，大定、威宁的铜，息烽的铝，都是著名的。川黔铁路修通以后，沿线以及全省矿产可以迅速地开采出来。省内各民族经济、文化生活会更快地发展。仅四川省供给贵州的食盐，现在每月需要一千多辆载重三吨半的卡车才能运完，将来用几列火车就运完了，不但可以腾出汽车加强短途运输，而且可以降低盐的运费。
    川黔铁路在四川境内，利用原有的綦江铁路。这段铁路从长江岸边的猫儿沱到四川边境的赶水场，只有线路的弯度、桥梁、隧道需要作部分修改。川黔铁路的长江大桥，川黔和成渝两条铁路连接站的位置也正在考虑中。现在修建的是从赶水场到贵阳这一段，全长三百四十公里。设计和施工部门，采取了边勘测，边设计，边施工的流水作业。现在从赶水场往南四十公里的路线，正在施工。重点工程小庆隧道已经开凿山洞。乌江大桥正进行钻探。
    这条铁路大部分线路在拔海两千多公尺的高山上弯弯曲曲地走过去，几乎60％的线路需要在山腰的陡壁上开凿出来。线路上将要有六十公尺深的桥墩，有三千公尺长的隧道，它比宝成铁路秦岭隧道还要长。
    线路的勘测和施工就有不少困难。“科斯特”现象是线路地质上的一个很大的特点。这是中国修建铁路史上从来没有碰到的现象。到过桂林的人免不了去逛一逛七星岩的山洞。它是“甲天下”的桂林山水的一个组成部分。洞里潮湿、阴暗，地方宽敞，有奇形怪状的石头，石门、石柱，有深不可测的深涧。这就是石灰岩层受了水的溶解，形成了奇形怪状的“溶洞”，在地质上叫做“科斯特”现象。在川黔线上，特别是凉风垭一带，这种溶洞是一片连一片。看地表面，是坚硬的岩石，打个钻眼，底下是空的。它的承载力很小，路基修在溶洞上边自然是很危险的，因此，线路必须绕过溶洞。测量人员就钻进溶洞里进行测量。
    测量溶洞跟逛桂林市七星岩的名胜可不一样，在七星岩有向导，洞子是向导走熟了的，危险的地段不许你去。可是，在这里测量人员钻的是从来没有人钻过的洞子，还要测量每个溶洞的大小，面积，每个地方非要亲自看看不可。测量人员挑选了年青小伙子，组织了溶洞小组。他们穿上雨衣、胶鞋，带上防野兽、毒蛇袭击的短刀，带上煤气灯、电筒，带上用绳子结成的软梯，还要带上测量仪器。他们走进去，里边黑洞洞的，宽阔的地方可以盖两幢大楼，一座工厂；狭窄的地方只能容一个人爬过去。有的地方潮湿、闷热；有的地方却刮着呼呼的狂风，有时听见哗哗的流水声。遇到深涧，手电筒照下去没有反光，石子投下去半天听不到回声。人们顺着软梯一步步地爬下去，有的竟达两三百公尺深。
    自古以来，人们用“天无三日晴，地无三里平”来形容贵州多雾、多山。因为沿线山上多雾，测量人员早晨爬上山去，提着灯罩上蒙上颜色的油灯，进行测量。在跳鱼洞，两边是立陡的削壁，中间是一条湍急的河流。他们划着小船，溯流而上。人们从船上攀登削壁上去，腰上拴着安全绳，手扶着测量的仪器进行测量。
    测量和钻探人员在工作中不断创造新的经验，提高工作效率。三分队按照新的编制，人员减少一半左右，还调走了三个工程师。但是他们采取了“内外业合一”的苏联先进经验，照样继续工作。这条先进经验就是说工程师在野外实地观测六小时，用最后两小时就地整理资料，培养测工代替工程师的工作。这样在现场整理资料，可以就地核对，保证了资料的准确性，还可以就地指导测工观测，对培养技术力量十分有利。晚上，他们回到住宿地，省得像过去那样熬夜整理资料，可以从事正规的理论和业务学习，或开展文化娱乐活动。（附图片）
