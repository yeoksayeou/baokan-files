Xinhua News Agency, July 21st: Miyazaki Hiroshi, the representative of the second group of 296 Japanese war criminals released in Fushun, delivered a letter of gratitude to the staff of the war criminals management center on the afternoon of the 18th, before leaving the center.

The letter of gratitude stated: We are now receiving a lenient pardon from the Chinese people, for which we have gratitude and appreciation that is beyond words. In the past, we grew up in a Japanese society ruled by greedy and insatiable warlords and plutocrats, and from childhood, we were influenced by barbaric militarist deceptive education. More than a decade ago, we took up hideous murder weapons and invaded the sacred territory of China, openly violating international law and humanitarianism, treating the diligent, simple, brave, and intelligent Chinese people who were working for peace and a happy life as "enemies," and committing countless crimes.

We committed irreparable sins and made indelible mistakes in history, and we deserved to be severely punished by the victorious Chinese people. However, the warm attitude of the Chinese people towards us and the meticulous and lenient humanitarian treatment they gave us were in no way similar to the cruel acts we had committed against the Chinese people in the past. For us, the past six years have been a process of moving from the dead end of death to the rebirth of light, a process of imparting new life force into our minds and bodies, and resurrecting us.

The letter of gratitude also stated: During our life here, the objective reality that we have directly come into contact with, whether it is a small matter in daily life or a major matter that needs attention, reflects the lofty and just will of the Chinese people to hope for lasting peace and happiness and to oppose imperialist aggression.

The Chinese people are not the "enemies" of the Japanese, but close friends who have had a deep friendship with the Japanese people for 2,000 years.

Our contact with such living facts has made us acutely aware of the greatness of peace and labor and the preciousness of human life.

Now we are about to return to our hometown, to that beautiful land where we have lived since childhood, and spend reunion days with our families, but the Chinese people who were killed by us will never return to your rich land! Thinking of this, our hearts are filled with shame and feelings of guilt, and we feel ashamed.

Our lives have been given to us by those who do not remember past grudges, only talk about the future, and treat us with smiling faces.

Only the Chinese people are our benefactors of regeneration and our reborn parents.

We will take the two treasures we have received from you—new life and truth—and in the second half of our lives, we will fight for the people, for society, and for peace."

The letter of gratitude concluded by saying that we have realized that the ugly war of aggression in the past was an unparalleled disaster for both the Chinese and Japanese people; it was of no benefit to ourselves either, and we will fight against wars of aggression and defend peace in the future.

    忏悔参加侵略战争的罪行
    感激中国人民的宽大待遇
    在抚顺释放的日本战争犯罪分子发表感谢文
    据新华社21日讯　在抚顺释放的第二批296名日本战争犯罪分子的代表宫崎弘，十八日下午在离开战犯管理所前，发表了对管理所工作人员的感谢文。
    感谢文说道：我们现在受到中国人民的宽大赦免，有着言语所不能形容的感谢和感激。我们过去生长在贪婪无厌的军阀和财阀们所统治的日本社会里，从幼小的时候起就受到野蛮的军国主义欺骗教育的影响。在十几年以前，我们拿着丑恶的杀人凶器，侵入神圣的中国领土，公然地违反国际法和人道，把勤劳、朴素、勇敢、智慧、为了和平和幸福生活而劳动着的中国人民当作“敌人”，犯下了罄竹难书的罪行。
    我们做出了不可挽回的罪恶，犯下了在历史上不可消灭的错误，理应受到胜利了的中国人民的严惩。但是，中国人民对于我们的温暖态度和给与我们的无微不至的宽大的人道待遇，却和我们过去对待中国人民的残虐行为，丝毫没有相同之处。过去六年的生活，对我们说来，是从死亡的绝路走向光明再生的过程，是在我们的头脑和身体里付与新生的力量，而使我们苏生过来的过程。
    感谢文还说：我们在这一期间的生活中，所直接接触到的客观的现实，不论是日常生活中多么细小的事情，或是需要注目的大事情，都反映了中国人民希望持久和平与幸福、反对帝国主义侵略的崇高和正义的意志。
    中国人民并不是日本人的“敌人”，而是两千年来一贯和日本人民有着深厚友谊的亲密的朋友。
    我们由于接触到了这样活生生的事实，使我们痛切地感到和平和劳动的伟大以及人类生命的宝贵。
    现在我们将要回到故乡，在幼时就住惯了的那个美丽的土地上，和家人们一起过团圆的日子了，可是，被我们所杀害了的中国人民，却永远也回不到你们富饶的土地上来了！想到这件事情，我们的心中充满了惭愧和对不起人的心情，感到了无地自容。
    我们的生命，是从不记前仇、只谈论着将来而用笑脸对待我们的各位所赐予的。
    只有中国人民，才是我们的再生恩人和重生的父母。
    我们要把从各位那里得到的两件宝物——新的生命和真理，在后半生中，要为人民、为社会和和平而奋斗。”
    感谢文最后说，我们已经认识到：过去的那个丑恶的侵略战争，对于中国人民，对于日本人民，都是一种无比的灾难；对于我们自己也是没有丝毫利益的，我们今后要为反对侵略战争和保卫和平而斗争。
