We Cannot Neglect Rural Drug Supply Work
Zhou Jun

This year, the need for medicine in rural areas has increased significantly. According to surveys in five counties in Shandong Province (Linyi, Junan, Tai'an, Jiaxiang, etc.), farmers' expenditures on medicine and hygiene products are expected to increase by an average of 69% compared to last year. This spring, the Liuzhuang and Yigou primary-level supply and marketing cooperatives in Puyang County, Henan Province, sold more than 70 health kits and 813 women's sanitary belts in two days. A member of the Qianjin Agricultural Production Cooperative in Hanchuan, Hubei Province, said: "In the past, we were afraid of spending money on medicine when we were sick, but now that we have joined the cooperative, we must take medicine immediately to keep our bodies healthy in order to increase our income." The above facts show that the task of supplying medicines in rural areas is becoming more arduous.

However, some leaders of supply and marketing cooperatives and pharmaceutical companies are not paying enough attention to the supply of medicines in rural areas. They do not inquire or inspect regularly, and they do not solve problems in a timely manner. In many counties in Liaoning Province, supply and marketing cooperative salespersons who have received drug supply training have been transferred to other jobs. The Yanglin District Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Hanchuan County, Hubei Province, keeps many medicines in boxes for a long time, preventing them from being seen by the masses. The Ping Le County Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Guangxi Province deals in 400 kinds of medicines, but more than 300 kinds are not suitable for sale in rural areas or have very low sales. The Ping Le County State-owned Pharmaceutical Company in Guangxi Province distributes penicillin ointment that will expire in three days to the supply and marketing cooperatives. Some pharmaceutical companies in some areas are pushing valuable maintenance drugs that are overstocked in cities to the supply and marketing cooperatives. Because the leaders of the supply and marketing cooperatives do not pay enough attention to the supply of medicines, accidents of selling the wrong medicine or taking the wrong medicine occur frequently. For example, a salesperson at the Liujia Village Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Taonan, Jilin, sold DDT powder to the masses as baking soda. The Fifth District Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Huitong County, Hunan Province, sold DDT emulsion as milk to farmers to feed their children, resulting in the death of the children from poisoning. The Lanxi County Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Zhejiang Province sold Santonin tablets without explaining the dosage, which also caused deaths. These are no longer ordinary mistakes, but dereliction of duty and criminal behavior! Staff of pharmaceutical companies and supply and marketing cooperatives in various regions must be vigilant and pay attention to and improve the supply of medicines in rural areas.

Summer is the season when medicines are most susceptible to mold and deterioration. All supply and marketing cooperatives that deal in medicines should conduct a general inspection of their stock of medicines, and resolutely stop selling medicines that have expired, become moldy, or deteriorated. At the same time, they should replenish new medicines in a timely manner according to the needs of the masses, so that there will be no stockouts or backlogs, and medicines will be available whenever they are needed. Supply and marketing cooperatives that are not yet dealing in medicines should actively start dealing in medicines according to the list of finished medicines for rural areas.

The pharmaceutical business is related to the people's health and safety, and it is also a highly technical job. This business can only be carried out well with knowledgeable salespersons. Therefore, supply and marketing cooperatives in various regions should assign personnel with medical knowledge to the pharmaceutical outlets; do not transfer personnel who have received pharmaceutical supply training to other jobs. All supply and marketing cooperatives that deal in medicines must strengthen the education of pharmaceutical salespersons, improve their sense of responsibility, so that they not only do not take the wrong medicine, but also patiently introduce the properties, usage, dosage, and storage methods of the medicine to the masses, so as to not only meet the needs of farmers for medicines in a timely manner, but also avoid making mistakes.

    不能忽视农村药品供应工作
    周钧
    今年农村对医药的需要，有了显著的增加。据山东临沂、莒南、泰安、嘉祥等五个县的调查，今年农民用于医药卫生用品的支出预计平均比去年增加了69％。今春河南濮阳县的柳庄、宜沟两个基层供销社，两天销出保健箱七十多个、妇女月经带813个。湖北汉川前进农业生产合作社的一个社员说：“过去是养病怕吃药花钱，现在参加合作社了，为了增加收入，有病得马上吃药把身体保养好。”上面这些事实说明，农村的医药供应工作更加繁重了。
    但是，现在有一部分供销合作社和医药公司的领导人员，对于农村的医药供应工作重视不够，平常不过问，不检查，有了问题也不及时解决。辽宁省有不少的县，把受过药品供应训练的供销合作社售货员调作其他工作。湖北汉川县杨林区供销合作社把很多药品长期放在箱子里，不使药品同群众见面。广西平乐县供销合作社经营药品四百种，但是有三百多种不适于在农村销售或销量很少。广西平乐县国营医药公司把再过三天就要失效的盘尼西林软膏批给供销合作社。有些地区的医药公司把在城市积压的贵重保养药品向供销合作社推销。由于供销合作社的领导人员对药品供应工作重视不够，错卖药、错服药的事故不断发生。如吉林洮南六甲村供销合作社营业员把滴滴涕粉当做小苏打卖给群众。湖南会同县五区供销合作社把乳剂滴滴涕当牛奶卖给农民喂小孩，结果小孩中毒死亡。浙江兰溪县供销合作社出售山道年片不介绍用量，也造成了死亡事故。这些已经不是一般的错误，而是渎职犯罪的行为了！各地医药公司和供销合作社的工作人员必须警惕起来，重视和改进农村的医药供应工作。
    夏季是药品最易发霉变质的季节。凡是经营药品的供销合作社，应该普遍检查一次存药，失效、发霉、变质的，要坚决停止出售。同时还要根据群众的需要，及时补充新药，做到既不脱销，也不积压，何时买，何时有。目前还没有经营医药的供销合作社，应该根据成药下乡的目录，积极把药品经营起来。
    医药业务关系人民的身体健康和生命安全，而它又是一项技术性较强的工作。只有有了内行的售货员，这项业务才能开展得好。所以，各地供销合作社应该把有医药知识的人员配备到医药门市部去；不要把受过医药供应训练的人员调作其他工作。所有经营药品的供销合作社都必须对药品营业员加强教育，提高他们的责任心，使他们不但不拿错药，还能耐心地向群众介绍药性、用法、用量和保存方法，做到既能及时满足农民对药品的需要，又不出差错。
