    New Things in the Countryside
    Relief Household Becomes a Surplus Grain Household
    Feng Jiaosheng, a member of the Liangwan Agricultural Cooperative in Wangwan Township, Xinyang County, Henan, has only a fourteen-year-old daughter; there is no one else in his family. Although he was allocated 5.5 mu of land during the land reform, he had no livestock or farm tools. In addition, he suffered from tuberculosis and could not do heavy work, so his annual income was not enough to eat for half a year. Therefore, he could not survive without relief grain. Village cadre Li Kaiwen said that he was "not able to deliver grain for seven years after liberation and has become a long-term recipient of relief!"
    Last December, he joined the agricultural cooperative. According to his physical condition, the cooperative assigned him to be a feeder, responsible for feeding three cows. After Feng Jiaosheng became a feeder, he worked very actively. He often prepared sufficient fodder for the cows and paid attention to hygiene, feeding the three cows very well, and the members were happy to use them. He not only carefully fed the cows he was responsible for but also helped and motivated other feeders. When the cows were plowing the fields, he also took time to participate in other labor.
    Because he actively participated in labor, by the time of the wheat harvest pre-distribution, he had already accumulated 1,005 work points, and could pre-distribute about 400 jin of wheat, which is almost twice as much as his total income in 1954. By the time of the autumn harvest final settlement, he could distribute at least 2,200 jin of grain. After eating, it is estimated that he could have a surplus of more than 1,000 jin. Feng Jiaosheng happily said: "I couldn't afford to make a cotton quilt in the past two years, but this year I will no longer suffer from not having a quilt!" (Wu Naiduo)

    农村新事
    救济户变余粮户
    河南信阳县王湾乡梁湾农业社社员冯叫生，只有个十四岁的小女外，家中再没有别的人。土地改革时虽分到了五亩五分田地，但是没有牲口、农具，再加上他有痨病不能作重活，每年的收入还不够半年吃。因此，不吃救济粮就活不下去。村干部李开文说他是“解放七年没完粮，成了救济老对象”！
    去年十二月，他加入了农业社。社里根据他的身体条件，分配他当饲养员，负责喂养三条牛。冯叫生担任饲养员以后，工作很积极。他常常给牛准备的草料很充足，又注意卫生，把三条牛都喂得很肥，社员们都乐意使用。他不仅精心喂养好自己负责的牛，还帮助和带动别的饲养员。在牛耕田时，他又抽空参加其它劳动。
    由于他积极参加劳动，到麦收预分时，已做到一千零五个工分，可预分小麦四百斤左右，几乎比他1954年全年的收入要多一倍。要是到秋收决算，最少也能分粮二千二百斤，除吃外估计可余粮一千多斤。冯叫生高兴地说：“我前两年想做条棉被也做不起，今年是不会再受没被子的苦了！”　（武乃铎）
