    Short Stories That Aren't Short Enough
    Wang Zhanying
    Some short stories nowadays easily run to ten thousand words. Clearly the story is short, but they insist on stretching it out; clearly there isn't much to say, but they just pad it out. You read a thousand words or so, and you've only seen a night scene, or only heard a burst of wind and rain.

    How we long to read those short stories like those of Lu Xun and Chekhov! In a space of two thousand words or so, the story is so engaging, the characters so lifelike, the whole thing is solid and substantial, every word rings like gold and stone. — However, these kinds of short stories are almost extinct now.

    This is probably because the “short” work is insufficient, and they take long stories to be a sign of ability. Commentary on short stories rarely pays attention to this issue.

    For a short story that should be short not to be short is, to the reader, truly unforgivable.

    短篇不短
  　王占英
    现在有些短篇小说，动不动就是万把字。明明故事短，硬要拉长，明明话不多，硬是往上凑。看上千把字，才只看到一幅夜景，或者才听到一片风雨声。
    我们是多么渴望着读到像鲁迅、契呵夫的那些短篇啊！在两千多字的篇幅里，故事那么吸引人，人物那么栩栩如生，通篇结结实实，字字掷地作金石声。——然而，现在这种短篇几乎绝迹了。
    这大抵是“短”工不足，而以长为能事。评论短篇小说的文字，也很少注意这个问题。
    该短的短篇而不短，对读者来说，实在是一件不能原谅的事。
