Strolling Through the Forest of Books
Xidi

Editor's Note: "Strolling Through the Forest of Books" is the general title of the reading notes that Mr. Xidi has written for us on request. In this column, the author will talk about some good books, both Chinese and foreign, ancient and modern, mainly focusing on ancient Chinese books. The first to be introduced are Wang Zhen's "Book of Agriculture" and "Bianmin Tuzuan" ("Illustrated Compendium for the Convenience of the People"), "Tiangong Kaiwu" ("Exploitation of the Works of Nature"), "Nongzheng Quanshu" ("Complete Treatise on Agricultural Administration"), and other ancient science books, with illustrations attached when necessary.

Walking on the road, seeing a lush, shady forest in the distance brings joy, and one can't help but walk into this forest and stroll around for a while, just a while, whether it is at the rising of the morning sun, or at noon when the old cicadas are chirping noisily, or when the shadows of trees and people are stretched long on the ground by the setting sun, it will give us a refreshing feeling. The delicate chirping of birds, the soft carpet of fallen leaves, the cool shade under the trees, and the sunlight, which has played enough on the branches and then jumps through the leaves in dappled spots onto the ground, almost all seem to be calling us to linger there for a while. Even the activities of the ants on the ground, such as how they go hunting, how they capture huge prey, and how they drag huge insects into small ant nests, if you want to carefully appreciate or observe them, are enough to kill half an hour or even an hour of your time.

In the past, scholars regarded "not peeking into the garden" as a virtue, which meant that they stayed in the study to read, and were not even willing to take a walk in the backyard. Today's students are different. Except for heavy snow or heavy rain, they can't be kept indoors. In twos and threes, they all bring books or notebooks to the campus, playground, or park to read. When I see them, I can't help but feel happy. Thirty or forty years ago, I used to bring books or galley proofs of books and periodicals that were about to be published to the park to work.

But let's get back to the subject. What I have said above is just the "introduction" of an "introduction." "There are houses of gold in books" is an old saying that encourages people to study. Of course, none of us today would think that the purpose of studying is to live in "houses of gold." No, we only understand that reading books and becoming all kinds of experts is for the purpose of serving the people. In the process of studying, that is, in the process of conducting research work, at the moment of engaging in this kind of labor, the research work itself will make people feel infinite joy. — Of course, it must go through the groping, sweating, and hard stage, the so-called stage of "I regret that my clothes are gradually loosening, but I am willing to be haggard for her." Strolling in the forest of books will at least not be less rewarding than strolling in a lush, shady forest.

There are so many things in the forest of books that can attract people that there will certainly not be fewer than in the forest. I'm just afraid that you won't go in. Once you go in, you will be fascinated by it and unable to leave. For example, if you take a "Water Margin" from the bookshelf, and read from Hong Taiwei's pilgrimage all the way to Wang Jin's grievance, secretly leaving Yanan Prefecture, to Lu Ti Xia punching Zhen Guanxi, and Lin Jiaotou's Snow Mountain Temple, would you be willing to put this book down? There are many people who read "Dream of the Red Chamber" so much that they can't eat, and read until late at night without sleeping. Once, many young artists scrambled to read "The Seagull" and "The Brave," reading until three o'clock the next morning, and were still unwilling to turn off the lights. As a result, they had to forcibly turn off the main gate of the lights at midnight. Some people say that these are novels, which naturally attract people and are fascinating. More rigid things may not be like this. In fact, that is not the case. The situation is still the same. For example, I often like to read books on planting flowers and fruits. If I accidentally get a "Runan Nursery History," how can I not rush to finish reading it? From this book, I learned that Wang Shimao had a "Miscellaneous Notes on Learning Gardening," but I searched everywhere and could not find it. Suddenly, one day, I saw a "Miscellaneous Works of Wang Fengchang" in an antique bookstore. I flipped through it, and there was "Miscellaneous Notes on Learning Gardening" in it, and it was a complete three-volume edition (the "Baoyantang Secret Collection" edition only had one volume). I quickly took it home and finished reading it under the lamp, and gained a lot. A friend likes to stroll through old bookstores, and he spends several hours doing so. Regardless of whether it is useful or not, he always carries a large bag of old books back. Sometimes he buys an illustrated Spanish version of
"The Adventures of Don Quixote," an exquisite German version of "Schiller's Complete Works," although he doesn't understand much Spanish or German, he feels unspeakable joy just looking at them on the bookshelf. Some experts have collected several rooms of old books and old magazines. They may not have read every book, but just flipping through the table of contents will give them an idea and benefit them a lot. Sometimes things that are "worn out iron shoes with nowhere to find" can be "obtained without any effort" in one of these flips. A Song Dynasty poem says: "I searched for her in the crowd thousands of times, and when I looked back suddenly, she was in the dimly lit place." This kind of realm is often encountered when strolling in the forest of books.

The forest of books is the most worthwhile and most deserving place to stroll, with boundless scenery and infinite wonders. Regardless of whether you are young or old, whether you are an expert or not, as long as he (or she) walks into this fascinating forest of books, as long as he strolls there for a while, he is guaranteed to go there constantly, and each stroll is guaranteed to have some harvest, more or less.

The above is just an opening remark. Below, I would like to "report truthfully" on what I have seen and gained while strolling in this forest of books. As long as everyone is not afraid of getting bored, I won't be able to finish my words for a while.

### 漫步书林

专栏：

    漫步书林
    西谛
    编者按：“漫步书林”是西谛先生应约为我们写的读书笔记的总题，在这一栏里，作者将谈谈一些中外古今的好书，而以中国的古书为主。首先要介绍的是王桢的“农书”和“便民图纂”、“天工开物”、“农政全书”等古代科学书，必要时将附以插图。
    在路上走着，远远地望见一座绿荫沉沉的森林，就是一个喜悦，就会不自禁地走入这座森林里，在那里漫步一会儿，仅仅是一会儿，不管是朝暾初升的时候也好，是老蝉乱鸣的中午也好，是树影、人影都被夕阳映照得长长地拖在地上的当儿也好，都会使我们有清新的感觉。那细碎的鸟声，那软毯子似的落叶，那树荫下的阴凉味儿，那在枝头上游戏够了，又穿过树叶儿斑斑点点的跳落在地上的太阳光，几乎无不像在呼唤着我们要在那里留连一会。就是地上的蚂蚁们的如何出猎，如何捕获巨大的俘虏物，如何把巨大的虫拖进小小的蚁穴等等的活动，如果要仔仔细细地玩赏或观察一下的话，也足够消磨你半小时乃至一小时的工夫。
    从前的念书人把“目不窥园”当作美德，那就是说，一劲儿关在书房里念书，连后花园也不肯去散步一会的意思。如今的学生们不同了。除掉大雪天或下大雨的时候，他们在屋里是关不住的了。三三两两地都带了书本子或笔记本子到校园里、操场上、或者公园里去念。我看了他们，就不自禁有一股子的高兴。我自己在三四十年前就是这样地带了书本子或带了将要出版的书刊的校样到公园里工作的。
    可是言归正传。以上所说的只是一个“引子”的“引子”。“书中自有黄金屋”是一句鼓励念书人的老话。当然，我们如今没有人还会想到念书的目的就是去住“黄金屋”。不，我们只明白念通了书做了各式各样的专家，其目的乃是为人民服务。在念书的过程里，也就是说，在进行研究工作的过程里，在从事这种劳动的当儿，研究工作的本身就会令人感染到无限喜悦的。——当然必须要经过摸索的流汗的辛苦阶段，即所谓“衣带渐宽终不悔，为伊消得人憔悴”的阶段。在书林里漫步一会儿，至少是不会比在绿荫沉沉的森林里漫步一会儿所得为少的。
    书林里所能够吸引人的东西，实在太多了，决不会比森林里少。只怕你不进去，一进去，准会被它迷住，走不开去。譬如你在书架上抽下一本“水浒传”来，从洪太尉进香念起，直念到王进受屈，私走延安府以至鲁提辖拳打镇关西，林教头风雪山神庙，你舍得放下这本书么？念“红楼梦”念得饭也吃不下去，念到深夜不睡的人是不少的。有一次有好些青年艺术工作者们抢着念“海鸥”，念“勇敢”，直念到第二天清晨三时，还不肯关灯。结果，只好带强迫地在午夜关上了电灯总门。有人说这些是小说书，天然地会吸引人入胜的。比较硬性的东西恐怕就不会这样了。其实不然。情况还是一般。譬如我常常喜欢读些种花种果的书。偶然得到了一部“汝南圃史”，又怎肯不急急把它念完呢。从这部书里知道了王世懋有一部“学圃杂疏”，遍访未得。忽然有一天在一家古书铺里见到一部“王奉常杂著”，翻了一翻，其中就有“学圃杂疏”，而且是三卷的足本（“宝颜堂秘笈”本只有一卷），连忙挟之而归，在灯下就把他读毕，所得不少。有一个朋友喜欢逛旧书铺，一逛就是几个钟头，不管有用没用，临了总是抱了一大包旧书回去。有时买了有插图的西班牙文的
  “吉呵德先生传”，精致的德文本的“席勒全集”，尽管他看不大懂西班牙文或德文，但他把它们摆在书架上望望，也觉得有说不出的喜悦。有的专家们，收集了几屋子的旧书、旧杂志，未见得每本都念过，但只翻翻目录，也就胸中有数，得益非浅。有时“踏破铁鞋无觅处”的东西，就在这一翻时“得来全不费工夫”。宋人的词有道：“众里寻他千百度，蓦然回首，那人却在灯火阑珊处。”这样的境界在漫步书林时是经常地会遇到的。
    书林是一个最可逛，最应该逛的地方，景色无边，奇妙无穷。不问年轻年老的，不问是不是一个专家，只要他（或她）走进了这一座景色迷人的书林里去，只要他在那里漫步一会儿，准保他会不断地到那儿去的，而每一次的漫步也准保会或多或少地有收获的。
    以上只是一个开场白。下面想把我自己在这座书林里漫步的时候的所见所得，择要地“据实道来”。只要大家不怕厌烦，我的话一时完不了。
