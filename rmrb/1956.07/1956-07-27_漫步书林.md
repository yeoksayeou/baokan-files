Strolling Through the Book Forest
Wang Zhen: "Nong Shu" (On Agriculture) (Part 1) Xidi

The book forest is as vast as the sea. Where does one begin with the "Twenty-Four Histories"? One can only talk about what one is familiar with. "The people regard food as their heaven." Agricultural production is a crucial link in socialist construction. It is meaningful to introduce some ancient books related to agriculture. China has long been known as a "nation founded on agriculture," but there are not many books about agriculture, far fewer than books on military affairs, and even less than the "stacks of books" on medicine. The "Siku Quanshu" (Complete Library in Four Sections) records ten titles from Jia Sixie's "Qi Min Yao Shu" (Essential Techniques for the Welfare of the People) of the Later Wei Dynasty onwards, and its supplementary catalog lists nine titles from Lu Guimeng's "Lei Si Jing" (Plow and Weeding Manual) of the Tang Dynasty onwards. Other bibliographies also record very few agricultural books. However, if books on economic crops, flowers, fruits, medicinal herbs, water conservancy, and livestock such as cattle and horses are included, they can also form a large collection. I remember that a "Chinese Agricultural Bibliography" was printed more than twenty years ago, but it is now rare. The reason I collect agricultural books is very simple: because they have woodcut illustrations. Later, by association, I also collected agricultural books without illustrations. Among the agricultural books with woodcut illustrations, I like Wang Zhen's "Nong Shu" (On Agriculture) of the Yuan Dynasty the most. This is a book of considerable length. I once saw a Shandong edition of the Ming Jiajing ninth year (1530 AD) at a certain place, in six volumes, with a preface by Yan Hong of Linqing. The illustrations in the book are simple and powerful, with a very broad atmosphere, and are top-notch works of woodcut painting. I intended to acquire a copy. After searching various bookstores in the north and south, I obtained a partial copy, in five volumes, only missing the sixteenth to twentieth sections of the "Nong Qi Tu Pu" (Illustrated Compendium of Agricultural Tools). Although not the complete book, I am satisfied. This book covers a wide range of topics and is divided into three parts. The first part is "Nong Sang Tong Jue" (General Principles of Agriculture and Sericulture), divided into six chapters. (The "Tong Jue" catalog has a note: "In ancient times, writing was done on bamboo and silk. It was not until the Later Han Dynasty that paper was used for writing, which then became scrolls, so they could be rolled and unrolled. In the second year of Changxing during the Mingzong reign of the Later Tang Dynasty of the Five Dynasties, an imperial edict ordered the printing of the Nine Classics, all in the form of collections of volumes. Today, it is appropriate to change 'scroll' to 'collection'." The Inner Rare Edition has no catalog, but changes 'collection' to 'volume'.) From the beginning of farming, the beginning of cattle plowing, the beginning of silkworm farming, the chapter on teaching time, the chapter on geographical advantages, the chapter on filial piety and diligence in farming, the chapter on land reclamation, the chapter on harrowing, the chapter on sowing, the chapter on weeding, the chapter on fertilizer, the chapter on irrigation, the chapter on encouragement, the chapter on harvesting, the chapter on storage, the chapter on planting, the chapter on animal husbandry, the chapter on silkworm reeling, to the chapter on prayer and recompense, it is a book of a "general discussion" nature, especially emphasizing the suitability of soil in various regions. "According to the northern agricultural customs: spring is suitable for early and late plowing, summer is suitable for both day and night plowing, and autumn is suitable for plowing when the sun is high. The Central Plains are all flat and open, with dry land. One plow must use two, three, or four oxen, with one person holding it, measuring the strength of the oxen, and the amount of land plowed. Their plowing all has fixed methods. The southern paddy fields are muddy. The fields vary in height, width, and narrowness. One plow uses one ox to pull it, and the turning is convenient for the person. This is the difference in the suitability of the terrain between the north and the south." (Land Reclamation Chapter) Words like this "adapting to local conditions" and meeting the needs of various regions can be read everywhere. The second part is "Nong Qi Tu Pu" (Illustrated Compendium of Agricultural Tools), divided into twenty chapters: the land system section, the plow and weeding tool section, the hoe and shovel section, the hoe section, the sickle section, the rake section, the raincoat and hat section, the basket section, the pestle and mortar section, the granary section, the pot section, the boat and cart section, the irrigation section, the utilization section, the wheat section, the silkworm reeling section, the silkworm and mulberry section, the weaving section, the cotton section, and the hemp section. All the tools needed for agriculture and sericulture are fully equipped, with detailed illustrations and explanations. The third part is "Gu Pu" (Grain Compendium), divided into eleven chapters: Chapters one and two are for grains, chapter three is for melons, chapters four and five are for vegetables, chapters six to eight are for fruits, chapter nine is for bamboo and wood, chapter ten is for miscellaneous items (ramie, cotton, tea, etc.), and chapter eleven is for food (this category lacks the "Bin Qiyue Shi Shuo" (Explanation of the "Seventh Month" poem of Bin) and "Shi Shi Wu Guan" (Five Observations at Mealtime), which are the same in all editions).

This book was written in the Gui Chou year of the Huangqing reign of the Yuan Dynasty (1313 AD), more than 640 years ago. Reading it still feels realistic, popular, and useful. It not only summarizes the good experiences of ancient agricultural science but also has new insights and new creations. The Siku Tiyao (Summary of the Complete Library in Four Sections) says: "The water tools recorded in the illustrated compendium are especially helpful for practical use." Indeed, some water tools in the irrigation and utilization sections are important creations. Wang Zhen himself said: "I have both narrated the old and added new things, and made objects according to local conditions, either setting up machinery to borrow its power, or using excavation to rely on its merit forever." (Introduction to the "Irrigation Section".) At the end of the "Illustrated Compendium" are attached the "Lawful and Longevity House" and the "Method of Making Movable Type Printing". The "Method of Making Movable Type Printing" is the most detailed description of the method of movable type printing before the publication of the "Wuyingdian Juchenban Chengshi" (Program of the Wuying Hall Movable Type Edition) during the Qianlong era, which is extremely important. It says that there are those who use baked clay characters, those who cast tin characters, and those who carve wooden characters. After Bi Sheng of the Song Dynasty created the clay movable type, in the early fourteenth century, it was further used for tin movable type and wood movable type (movable type printing in Europe began in the mid-fifteenth century). Describing the method of picking characters, it says: "Two wheels are placed, one wheel is placed with the tone board, and one wheel is placed with the miscellaneous character board. One person sits in the middle, and can push and pick characters to the left and right. It is difficult for people to find characters, but it is easy for characters to come to people. This method of rotating the wheel does not require effort and can easily retrieve the number of characters, and after taking them, they can be put back into the rhyme, which is convenient in both ways." This is also a creation. In the past, I saw the typesetting workers all standing and picking characters, the so-called "people looking for characters," but they did not use this scientific method of sitting and picking characters, "characters coming to people," which was invented more than 640 years ago.

    漫步书林
    王祯：农书（上）西谛
    书林浩瀚如大海，“一部二十四史从何说起”呢？只能就自己所熟悉的谈谈吧。“民以食为天”。农业生产乃是社会主义建设的一个重要的环节。首先介绍几部古代的有关农业的书籍是有意义的。中国夙称“以农立国”，但有关农业的书却不很多，远不如兵书之多，更不如医书的“汗牛充栋”。“四库全书”所著录的自后魏贾思勰“齐民要术”以下凡十部，其附存目则自唐陆龟蒙“耒?经”以下凡九部。其他书目里，著录的农书也很少。但如果把有关经济作物的书，有关花、果、药物的书，水利的书，和有关牛马等牧畜的书一同统计在内，则也可成一巨帙。记得二十多年前曾有“中国农业书目”一册印行，惜今已罕见。我之所以收集农书，原因很简单，就是因为它们有木刻的插图。后来，连类而及，就连没有插图的农书也兼收并蓄之了。在有木刻插图的农书里，我最喜欢元代王祯撰的“农书”。这是一部篇幅相当大的书。我曾于某氏处见到一部明嘉靖九年（公元一五三○年）的山东刊本，凡六册，首有临清阎闳序。书中插图，浑朴有力，气象甚为阔大，是木刻画里的上乘之作。因着意欲收购一部。访之南北各肆，乃获残本一部，凡五册，仅阙“农器图谱”集之十六至二十。虽非全书，亦自满意。此书包罗甚广，凡分三部分。首为“农桑通诀”，分六集。（“通诀”目录下“注云：“古之文字皆用竹帛。逮后汉始纸为疏，乃成卷轴，以其可以舒卷也。至五代后汉〔按“汉”应作“唐”〕明宗长兴二年，诏九经版行于世，俱作集册。今宜改卷为集”。内聚珍本无目录，却改集为卷。）自农事起本，牛耕起本，蚕事起本，授时篇，地利篇，孝弟力田篇，垦耕篇，耙劳篇，播种篇，锄治篇，粪壤篇，灌溉篇，劝助篇，收获篇，蓄积篇，种植篇，畜养篇，蚕缫篇到祈报篇，是“通论”性质的书，特别着重说明南北各地的土宜。“北方农俗所传：春宜早晚耕，夏宜兼夜耕，秋宜日高耕。中原地皆平旷，旱田陆地，一犁必用两牛、三牛或四牛，以一人执之，量牛强弱，耕地多少，其耕皆有定法。南方水田泥耕，其田高下阔狭不等，以一犁用一牛挽之，作止回旋，惟人所便。此南北地势之异宜也。”（垦耕篇）像这一类的“因地制宜”，切合各地需要的话是随处可以读到的。次为“农器图谱”，分二十集：田制门，耒?门，钁臿门，钱镈门、铚艾门、杷朳门、蓑笠门、蓧蒉门、杵臼门，仓廪门、鼎釜门、舟车门、灌溉门、利用门、麰麦门、蚕缲门、蚕桑门，织紝门、纩絮门及麻苎门，凡农桑所需的器物，无不毕具，绘图立说，极为详尽。第三部分为“谷谱”，分十一集：集之一至二为谷属，集之三为蓏属，集之四至五为蔬属，集之六至八为果属，集之九为竹木，集之十为杂类（苎麻、木绵，茶等），集之十一为饮食类（这类内阙“豳七月诗说”及“食时五观”二篇，各本皆同）。
    这部书作于元皇庆癸丑（公元一三一三年），离今已有六百四十多年了，读起来还觉得语语翔实，通俗合用，不仅总结了古代农业科学的好的经验，而且，更有新的见解和新的创造。四库提要云：“图谱中所载水器，尤于实用有裨。”的确，在灌溉、利用二门里，有的水器是很重要的创作。王祯自云：“既述旧以增新，复随宜以制物，或设机械而就假其力，或用挑浚而永赖其功。”（“灌溉门”引言。）“图谱”的最后，附有“法制长生屋”，“造活字印书法”等。“造活字印书法”乃是乾隆时的“武英殿聚珍版程式”一书出版前的一篇最详尽的叙述活字印书的方法的文章，极为重要。其中说，有用烧熟瓦字的，有铸锡作字的，又有雕板木为字的。从宋代毕升创作胶泥活字版后，到了十四世纪的初期，已进一步地用到锡活字和木活字了（欧洲用活字印书开始于十五世纪中）。叙述捡字方法，说：“凡置轮两面，一轮置监韵板面，一轮置杂字板面，一人中坐，左右皆可推转摘字。盖以人寻字则难，以字就人则易。此转轮之法，不劳力而坐致字数，取讫又可铺还韵内，两得便也。”这也是一个创造。我从前见排板的工人们皆立而摘字，所谓“以人寻字”的，却没有利用到六百四十多年前就已发明的这种坐而摘字，“以字就人”的科学方法。
