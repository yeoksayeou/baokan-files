Xinhua News Agency, Zhenyuan, July 24th: The Southeast Guizhou Miao and Dong Autonomous Prefecture has been officially established. This was announced at the first session of the First People's Congress of the Southeast Guizhou Miao and Dong Autonomous Prefecture, which opened on July 15th and closed on July 23rd in Zhenyuan County, Guizhou Province.

    254 representatives of the Miao, Dong, Han, and Buyi ethnic groups attended the meeting. Sa Kongliao (Mongolian), Deputy Director of the Nationalities Affairs Commission of the People's Republic of China, Tian Fuda (Gaoshan), a member of the Nationalities Committee of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, and a Guizhou Provincial delegation headed by Zhou Lin, Secretary of the Guizhou Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and Governor of Guizhou Province, also came to participate in the meeting to congratulate the establishment of the Southeast Guizhou Miao and Dong Autonomous Prefecture. The conference also received more than ten congratulatory telegrams from party and government leading organs in Yunnan, Guizhou, Hunan and other provinces.

    During the meeting, the representatives listened to, reviewed, and approved the report made by Zhang Yuhuan, Secretary of the CPC Southeast Guizhou Local Committee on the work situation in the Southeast Guizhou region over the past six years and the work opinions for 1956, on behalf of the CPC Southeast Guizhou Local Committee. They elected Wang Dean (Miao) as the Governor of the Autonomous Prefecture, Liang Wanggui (Dong), Wu Chaoming (Miao), Liu Xuemin (Han), Wang Yaolun (Miao), and Yang Fuhe (Dong) as Deputy Governors, and twenty-nine members of the Autonomous Prefecture People's Committee; and Yang Zairong (Miao) as President of the Autonomous Prefecture Intermediate People's Court. It was decided that Kaili Town, Lushan Miao Autonomous County, would be the site of the Autonomous Prefecture; and the organizational regulations (draft) of the Autonomous Prefecture People's Congress and People's Committee were formulated and adopted.

    During the four days of discussions at the conference, seventy-six representatives stated in their speeches that the political, economic, and cultural construction undertakings in the Southeast Guizhou region had made great progress in the six years since liberation. Especially after the realization of elementary agricultural cooperation throughout the region this spring, with the economic support and technical guidance of the people's government, the "slash-and-burn" cultivation methods in remote mountainous areas have been changed, and agricultural production has been rapidly developed. The material and cultural lives of all ethnic groups have been significantly improved. Many representatives could not help but sing loudly in their speeches, one of the song's lyrics roughly saying:

    Communist Party!
    We are like small fish,
    And you are the long flowing water of the Qingshui River;
    Chairman Mao!
    We are like small trees on the Miaoling Mountains,
    You are the sun that shines on our growth.

    At the meeting, representatives also criticized the shortcomings and errors in the implementation of ethnic policies in some areas, such as failing to take into account the characteristics of minority ethnic groups and failing to respect ethnic customs. For example, in some places, the cattle raised by minority ethnic groups for bullfighting and the fields used by girls for dowries were all indiscriminately incorporated into the cooperatives. In agricultural production, some agricultural cooperatives lacked arrangements for sideline occupations for members' families, and in the cultural life of minority ethnic groups, the Malanpo, Lusheng Pond, and bullfighting arenas, which occupy an important position, were also reclaimed and planted with crops. In the work of training ethnic minority cadres, some leading cadres do not pay attention to training women cadres; in commercial work, state-owned commercial departments provide poor special commodities for minority ethnic groups, which cannot meet the special needs of minority ethnic groups.

    In order to correct these shortcomings and better build the autonomous prefecture, the representatives attending the meeting put forward 299 suggestions and proposals, including strengthening cadres' study of ethnic policies and investigation and research on ethnic conditions, and paying attention to the all-round training of ethnic minority cadres.

    On the last day of the meeting, Wang Dean, Liang Wanggui, and Liu Xuemin, on behalf of the Southeast Guizhou Miao and Dong Autonomous Prefecture, presented local specialties such as silver fungus, Yunwu tea, and tiger skin to the beloved great leader of all ethnic groups, Chairman Mao Zedong. Sa Kongliao accepted the gifts on behalf of Chairman Mao. The conference also passed a congratulatory telegram to the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, expressing the sincere gratitude of the people of the Southeast Guizhou Miao and Dong Autonomous Prefecture to the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao.

    黔东南苗族侗族自治州成立
    新华社镇远24日电　黔东南苗族侗族自治州正式成立。这是七月十五日在贵州省镇远县开幕、二十三日闭幕的黔东南苗族侗族自治州第一届人民代表大会第一次会议宣布的。
    出席这次会议的有苗、侗、汉、布依等民族人民代表254人。中华人民共和国民族事务委员会副主任萨空了（蒙古族）、全国人民代表大会常务委员会民族委员会委员田富达（高山族）、和以中共贵州省委书记、贵州省省长周林为首的贵州省代表团，也前来参加了这次会议，祝贺黔东南苗族侗族自治州成立。大会还收到云南、贵州、湖南等省党政领导机关的贺电十多件。
    会议期间，代表们听取、审查并批准了中共黔东南地方委员会书记张玉环代表中共黔东南地方委员会所作关于黔东南地区六年来的工作情况和1956年工作意见的报告。选出州长王德安（苗族）、副州长梁旺贵（侗族）、吴朝明（苗族）、刘学民（汉族）、王耀伦（苗族）、杨富和（侗族）及自治州人民委员会委员二十九人；和自治州中级人民法院院长杨再荣（苗族）；确定以炉山苗族自治县凯里镇为自治州州址；并制定和通过了自治州人民代表大会和人民委会员组织条例（草案）。
    在四天的大会讨论中，七十六位代表在发言中一致认为黔东南地区解放六年来，政治、经济和文化建设事业都获得很大发展。特别是今春全区实现了初级农业合作化以后，在人民政府经济上的支持和技术上的指导下，改变了边远山区“刀耕火种”的耕作方法，农业生产得到迅速发展。各族人民的物质文化生活都得到显著的改善和提高。许多代表在发言中都情不自禁地放声高歌，其中有一首歌词大意说：
    共产党啊！
    我们像一条条小鱼，
    而您是清水江的长流水；
    毛主席啊！
    我们像苗岭山上的小树，
    您就是照耀我们成长的太阳。
    会上，代表们对某些地区贯彻执行民族政策中，不照顾少数民族特点和不尊重民族风俗习惯的缺点和错误，也提出了批评。例如有些地方把少数民族养来斗牛的牛，留给姑娘出嫁用的田，都一律入社。在农业生产中，有的农业社对社员 家庭副业缺少安排，在少数民族文化生活中，占重大地位的马郎坡、籚笙塘、斗牛场，也被开垦种上了庄稼。在培养民族干部工作方面，有些领导干部不重视培养妇女干部；在商业工作中，国营商业部门供应少数民族特殊商品差，满足不了少数民族人民的特殊需要。
    为了纠正这些缺点，更好的建设自治州，参加会议的代表们提出了299件建议和提案，这些建议和提案中包括有加强干部对民族政策的学习，和对民族情况的调查研究，注意全面培养少数民族干部等。
    会议最后一天，王德安、梁旺贵、刘学民代表黔东南苗族侗族自治州，向敬爱的各族人民伟大领袖毛主席献了当地特产银耳、云雾茶和虎皮，萨空了代表毛主席接受了献礼。大会还通过了向党中央和毛主席的致敬电。表达了黔东南苗族侗族自治州人民对中国共产党和毛主席的衷心感激心情。
