Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, July 11th: The Indonesian "People's Daily" reported on the 10th that the General Secretary of the Indonesian Communist Party, Aidit, analyzed the current domestic situation in Indonesia at a public gathering in Bandung on the 8th, and explained the Communist Party's attitude towards several current issues.

Aidit pointed out that there are currently three major social forces in Indonesia, which are roughly evenly matched. These three forces are: 1. The force of the stubborn group, which is the combined force of compradors and landlords allied with foreign imperialists; 2. The progressive force, which is the combined force of workers, peasants, petty bourgeoisie, and revolutionary intellectuals; 3. The middle force, which is the force of the national bourgeoisie. Each of these three forces has its own political views on realizing the ideals of the August 1945 Revolution.

The stubborn group only demands Indonesia's nominal independence, and in reality, they want to place Indonesia under the control of American forces. The progressive force is committed to eliminating the power of foreign imperialists and landlords and establishing a people's regime. The middle-of-the-road faction's view on realizing the ideals of the August Revolution is only to carry out some democratic reforms so that national capitalism can develop in Indonesia.

Aidit said that the progressive view is the most in line with the ideals of the August 1945 Revolution. He recalled that President Sukarno said on the eve of the declaration of independence that Indonesian independence was not for the aristocracy and capitalists, but for all the people.

Aidit said that the political line of the Indonesian Communist Party is to develop the progressive forces, unite the middle forces, and oppose the stubborn group. "At the current stage, we do not consider the national bourgeoisie to be more dangerous than the imperialists. We believe that the poverty of the Indonesian people is not due to the large number of national capitalists, but to the large number of imperialist elements who are plundering Indonesia's wealth. Therefore, at the current stage, the Indonesian Communist Party does not oppose national enterprises - national enterprises that are not agents of comprador or foreign monopoly capitalists. We also agree to cooperate with landlords who oppose imperialism, but at the same time demand a reduction in land rent so that they cannot excessively exploit the peasants."

When talking about his party's attitude towards the current cabinet, Aidit said that the Communist Party will adhere to the policy adopted by the party's Fifth Congress, which is to demand the organization of a national united government composed of representatives from all social classes in Indonesia, including the working class. This demand means that the Communist Party is willing to share the responsibility of the government, which should naturally be the result of the Communist Party's pursuit of a national united front policy. Whenever a cabinet crisis occurs, the Communist Party will make this request. The fact that the Communist Party is excluded from the cabinet means that the party is only responsible for the good measures of the government, because it only supports the government's progressive program. It is unfair to say that the Communist Party is also responsible for the bad situation. If the situation deteriorates, it is not the fault of the Communist Party, but the fault of the stubborn group that hinders the Communist Party from participating in the cabinet.

Aidit welcomed the attitude of various political parties agreeing to abolish the Round Table Conference agreement. He also said that abolishing the Round Table Conference agreement does not mean simply abolishing it on paper. This first means driving all Dutch big capitalists out of Indonesia.

Aidit suggested that the funds needed for Indonesia's first five-year plan should be obtained by reducing the profits of imperialists, landlords, and the wealthy. "If the implementation of the five-year plan will increase the tax burden on the people, we cannot agree to that, because at present, the burden on the people is already too heavy."

    艾地阐述印度尼西亚共产党政策
    要求组织各社会阶级的民族联合政府
    新华社雅加达11日电　印度尼西亚“人民日报”十日报道，印度尼西亚共产党总书记艾地八日在万隆的公众集会上分析了印度尼西亚目前的国内局势，并且说明了共产党对当前几个问题的态度。
    艾地指出，目前印度尼西亚大体上有三种社会力量，它们差不多势均力敌。这三种力量是：一、顽固集团的力量，这是跟外国帝国主义者结成联盟的买办和地主的联合力量；二、进步力量，这是工人、农民、小资产阶级和革命知识分子的联合力量；三、中间力量，即民族资产阶级的力量。这三种力量各有其实现1945年8月革命理想的政治见解。
    顽固集团只要求印度尼西亚的名义上的独立，实际上他们想把印度尼西亚置于美国势力控制之下。进步力量致力于消除外国帝国主义者和地主的势力，建立人民的政权。而中间派关于实现八月革命理想的见解只是进行某种民主改革，以使民族资本主义能够在印度尼西亚发展。
    艾地说，进步派的见解是最符合1945年8月革命的理想的。他追述说，苏加诺总统在宣布独立的前夕说，印度尼西亚独立不是为了贵族和资本家，而是为了全体人民。
    艾地说，印度尼西亚共产党的政治路线是发展进步力量，团结中间力量，反对顽固集团。“在目前阶段，我们并不认为民族资产阶级比帝国主义者更危险。我们认为，目前印度尼西亚人民的贫困并不是由于有很多的民族资本家而是由于有很多正在掠夺印度尼西亚财富的帝国主义分子。因此，在目前阶段，印度尼西亚共产党并不反对民族企业——民族的而不是买办的或外国垄断资本家的代理人的企业。我们还同意同反对帝国主义的地主合作，但是同时要求减轻地租，使他们不可能过多地剥削农民。”
    艾地在谈到他的党对于现内阁的态度时说，共产党将坚持党第五次代表大会通过的政策，即要求组织由印度尼西亚各社会阶级包括工人阶级在内的代表组成的民族联合政府。这个要求意味着，共产党愿意分担政府的责任，这自然应该是共产党奉行民族统一战线政策的结果。不论在什么时候发生内阁危机，共产党就要提出这个要求来。共产党被排斥在内阁之外的事实意味着，党只对政府的好的措施负责，因为它只支持政府的进步纲领。说共产党也要对不良的情况负责是不公正的。如果形势恶化，这不是共产党的过失，而是阻挠共产党参加内阁的顽固集团的过失。
    艾地欢迎各政党同意取消圆桌会议协定的态度。他又说，取消圆桌会议协定丝毫不是说只是在纸上取消。这首先意味着，把所有荷兰大资本家从印度尼西亚赶出去。
    艾地建议，应该用减少帝国主义者、地主和富翁的利润的办法来取得印度尼西亚第一个五年计划所需的资金。“如果实施五年计划将使人民的捐税负担增加，那是我们不能同意的，因为在目前，人民的负担已经太重了。”
