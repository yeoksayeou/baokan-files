      IV. Small Streams Flow into the Sea

    In April of this year, the Party approved my application to join the Party. I still remember that unforgettable night of swearing the oath of admission to the Party. In front of the solemn Party flag and the portrait of Chairman Mao, the hardships of the past and the happiness of today surged into my heart, and I let the tears flow down my face. However, I have never felt my life so full, I am already forty-five years old, but I feel like I have never been so young.

    At the Party branch meeting, I loyally reported to the Party my life's experiences and actions. Actors from various brotherly theatrical troupes also attended this branch meeting as observers. I told the Party what was in my heart: I am willing to be a Party art worker for life, and I want to do a good job in art wholeheartedly, without haggling over fame and fortune. Not caring about fame and fortune is not just my personal characteristic, all the brothers and sisters in our troupe are like this. Perhaps it is the past bumpy and difficult experiences that have cultivated this good tradition in us. In the harsh environment of the old society, we were able to rely on each other and barely continue the dying lives of Kunqu Opera and Suju Opera, relying on everyone's close unity. In this play, you play the main role, and I play a minor role; in that play, I play the main role, and you play a minor role. Everyone did not have the idea that playing the main role made you superior or playing a minor role made you inferior. Everyone believes: I am performing well for the sake of the play, not performing well for my own sake. Now, our troupe is on the right track. But we must maintain this tradition. If an actor constantly thinks about his own fame and fortune, he will be discouraged when his fame and fortune are not satisfied, and after he has gained both fame and fortune, he will lose his motivation to improve, and his artistic life will be over, which is the most terrible thing!

    After joining the Party, I felt even more the importance of my task. In order to develop Kunqu Opera art, we must make greater efforts. We must pass on the art to the next generation, so that the next generation will surpass the previous one. This is the task assigned to us by the Party. I will definitely work hard to complete this task. (The End)

    从崎岖小径到康庄大道
    周传瑛
      四、细流归大海
    今年四月，党批准了我的入党要求。我还记得宣誓入党的那个难忘的夜晚。在庄严的党旗和毛主席像前，过去的辛酸和今天的幸福一齐涌上心头，我一任眼泪在脸上流。但是，我也从来没有感到过生命这样充实，我已经四十五岁了，可是我觉得我从来没有这样年轻过。
    在党支部大会上，我忠诚地向党报告了我半生的经历和行为。参加这次支部大会旁听的还有各兄弟剧团的演员。我向党讲了我心里的话：愿意终身作一个党的艺术工作者，要一心搞好艺术工作，不要斤斤计较名利。不计较名利，这并不只是我个人的特点，我们剧团中的兄弟姐妹们都是这样的。也许是过去的坎坷困顿的遭遇，使我们培养了这个好的传统。我们在旧社会那种恶劣环境里，能够相依为命，把昆剧和苏剧的奄奄一息的生命勉强地延续下来，就是依靠了大家的亲密团结。在这个戏里你演主角，我跑龙套；在那个戏里，我演主角，你跑龙套。大家都没有演主角就高人一等、跑龙套就矮人一头的想法。大家都认为：我为了演好戏，而不是演好戏为了我。现在，我们剧团是走上顺境了。但是这个传统我们是一定要保持下去的。一个演员若是念念不忘自己的名利，当名利得不到满足的时候，他会灰心丧气，而当名利双收之后，他又会失掉上进心，他的艺术生命也就完了，这是最可怕的事！
    入党以后，我更加感到自己任务的重大。为了发展昆曲艺术，我们必须作更大的努力。必须把艺术传给下一代，使下一代青胜于蓝。这是党交给我们的任务。我一定努力去完成这个任务。　（完）
