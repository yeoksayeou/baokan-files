    Give More Care to the Masses in Marginal Areas
    At the Second Congress of the Communist Party of China in Shaanxi Province, delegates from the southern border areas of Shaanxi Province made well-founded, bold, and sharp exposures and criticisms of the bureaucratic and subjective style of leadership of provincial-level leading organs, which failed to care about the construction of the border areas, understand the situation in the border areas, and provide specific assistance to solve the difficulties of the border areas.
    In the southern border areas of Shaanxi Province, with the victory of socialist reform, the enthusiasm of the people for building socialism has soared to unprecedented heights. Everyone is thinking about how to increase grain yield even higher, raise cattle, sheep, and pigs even fatter, and harvest more tea trees, lacquer trees, tung trees, as well as ramie, wood ear, and other local specialties... to cultivate the mountainous areas into rich and beautiful paradises. In order to realize this ideal, a large-scale production movement has been launched everywhere. This year, the per-mu yield of wheat and broad beans in the Ankang area increased by 30% compared to last year, and the area of autumn crops this year has been expanded compared to previous years, with high-yield fields of thousand-jin rice, thousand-jin corn, thousand-jin beans, and ten-thousand-jin sweet potatoes everywhere. In the Hanzhong area, summer crops this year increased by more than 20% compared to last year, and various other local specialties, such as oranges, tea, tung seeds, and lacquer, will also have a bumper harvest this year. However, the people's enthusiasm has not received the attention and support of the provincial-level leading organs. On the contrary, the people's enthusiasm for building socialism has been affected because the provincial Party committee and various provincial-level leading organs have not paid attention to strengthening leadership over the border areas.
    At the Second Congress of the Communist Party of China in Shaanxi Province held from June 27 to July 5, delegates from the border areas criticized these shortcomings of the provincial-level leading organs.
    Delegates from the border areas generally stated that they have not seen responsible personnel from provincial departments going deep into the border areas to inspect work and help solve problems for a long time. The work style of some personnel sent down by leading organs is not good. After they go down, they not only do not provide much help to the work in the border areas, but also leave a very bad impression among the masses. A delegate from Baihe County, which borders Hubei Province, said that once the Primary Education Section of the Provincial Education Department sent a comrade to Baihe to inspect education work. At that time, the staff of the Baihe County People's Committee and the County Party Committee were very happy, hoping that this comrade could help solve some problems in local education work. The result was very disappointing. This comrade only looked at the primary school in the county seat and criticized the leaders of Baihe County. Later, in order to make him understand the overall situation of primary education, the comrades in the county asked him to go to the primary school in the mountains. He didn't want to go because the road was too far. The county agreed to hire livestock for him, but he said he couldn't ride. The county said it would hire a sedan chair (a type of transportation like a palanquin) for him, but he said he didn't have time. This situation is not an isolated case. Some personnel sent down by leading organs are like "imperial envoys," criticizing everything after seeing some trivial matters.
    Because provincial-level leaders often do not go to the border areas, and the personnel sent down do not go deep into their work, the provincial departments are not familiar with the situation in the border areas, and often make instructions and decisions that do not conform to the actual situation in the border areas. A representative from Zhenping County said that most of Zhenping County is mountainous, and more than 60% of the mountainous land has been afforested. The most urgent requirement of the masses at present is how to protect the existing forests. However, the Provincial Forestry Department decided to plant 180,000 mu of trees in Zhenping County. The masses in Zhenping County asked: Where should the trees be planted? For example, some representatives reflected that relevant departments instructed and required these places to eliminate "four pests" within half a year, and required every village to have a ball field! They did not think that in a place full of high mountains and forests, how could they eliminate "four pests" within half a year, and how could they find a place to build a ball field in every village?
    When the border areas reflect problems, the leading organs cannot deal with them in a timely manner. Some problems have not been resolved for more than a year. Many delegates criticized this style of work of the provincial-level leading organs at the meeting. For example, in the spring of 1955, the Sichuan Provincial Industrial Department's exploration team discovered a phosphorus mine in the Beiba district of Nanzheng County and conducted detailed drilling work. At that time, the Nanzheng County Party Committee and the County People's Committee reported to the Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial People's Committee, respectively, requesting the mining of this phosphorus mine, and explained that mining this mine would not cost much money, but it would have a very important effect on the agricultural production movement in the Hanzhong area. After that, they urged it many times, but there were no results. It was not until March of this year, when the Sichuan Provincial Industrial Department sent the factory director and construction workers to formally build a factory, that the province decided to build and mine the factory in this province. In addition, tea farmers in the Pingli, Ziyang, and Nanzheng areas lacked fine hemp bags for kneading tea. They had made countless suggestions to the higher authorities, but the problem had not been solved for a long time. A culvert on the highway in Baihe County was broken, and the repair cost was only 900 yuan, but it has not been resolved. Later, Zhushan County, Hubei Province, which is adjacent to it, paid this expense.
    Some representatives said: The provincial departments have an even more erroneous view of the border areas, regarding the masses in the border areas as backward. Therefore, no matter what, these places are always ranked behind. For example, the cadres assigned to these places are often ideologically backward or have made mistakes. There is a popular saying among cadres in the southern border area of Shaanxi: "Don't be afraid of being naughty and troublesome, you will be assigned to the mountainous area to train." There are also many problems in the distribution of chemical fertilizers and fine seeds. The amount of chemical fertilizer obtained by a county here is not as much as that obtained by a township in the central area. Is it because these counties do not need it? No, each county needs chemical fertilizer very much. For example, Pingli County carried out a 10,000-mu thousand-jin rice production movement this year, and other work was done very well, but there was a lack of fertilizer, and the relevant departments did not solve it.
    The people and staff in the border areas generally feel that the provincial departments do not care enough about their lives, such as the shortage of department stores, high prices, and poor medical and health conditions. The prices in the areas of Sichuan and Hubei provinces adjacent to these counties, which are also border areas, differ greatly from those in this area, so it is no wonder that the masses have opinions.
    The most painful thing in the lives of the masses in the border areas is that there are many diseases. However, the health centers in the counties are mostly equipped with very simple equipment, so there is no way to treat diseases, especially some acute diseases. Although the Ankang Area People's Hospital can accept patients from various counties, it is far from the counties, and transportation is inconvenient. In fact, it is difficult for patients from various counties to come here for treatment. The provincial leading departments are not unaware of this situation. Sometimes, the provincial health department also sends medical personnel down, but these personnel cannot endure hardship and are unwilling to work in the mountains. Once, measles was very prevalent in Xunyang County, and there were four or five hundred patients in the most serious area. However, the medical personnel sent down by the province could not endure hardship and left after only a few days. This incident aroused great dissatisfaction among the masses.
    What is even more infuriating is that sometimes when people are sent to the province for treatment, no one cares about them. For example, Wang Dengfa, the deputy secretary of the district committee of Baihe County, suffered from mental illness. Baihe County could not treat it, so it asked to be sent to Ankang People's Hospital. The Ankang Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China disagreed. They said that the conditions in the province were better and asked them to send it to the Provincial Party Committee. The Baihe County Committee of the Communist Party of China sent cadre Wang Pengyuan to send Wang Dengfa to the Provincial Party Committee. Unexpectedly, as soon as he arrived at the Cadre and Administrative Department of the Organization Department of the Provincial Party Committee, he was turned away. They asked who asked to send a madman here, insisted that this was not in accordance with organizational procedures, and refused to accept him, and even refused to let him stay in the guest house, asking them to stay in a hotel, and stated that if there was a problem, Wang Pengyuan would be responsible. In the end, Wang Pengyuan had to send Wang Dengfa back to his old home in northern Shaanxi. Since then, if the staff of Baihe County have any diseases, they would rather go to Xiangyang Area in Hubei Province for treatment than look for the Prefectural Committee and the Organization Department of the Provincial Party Committee.
    Now is the time to mobilize all positive factors to complete the first five-year plan ahead of schedule and exceed the target. The representatives believe that the Provincial Party Committee and leading departments at all levels must overcome past shortcomings and strengthen specific leadership over these areas. Only in this way can the enthusiasm of the people in the border areas be fully brought into play and used for the cause of building a socialist society.

    更多地关心边沿地区的群众
    在中共陕西省第二次代表大会上来自陕西省南部边沿区的代表对省级领导机关不关心边沿地区建设，不了解边沿地区情况，不具体帮助边沿地区解决困难的官僚主义和主观主义的领导作风作了有根有据的大胆尖锐的揭发和批评。
    在陕西省南部的边沿区，随着社会主义改革的胜利，人民群众建设社会主义的积极性空前高涨。每个人都在想着如何把粮食产量提得更高些、把牛羊猪养得更肥些，把茶树、漆树、桐树以及苎麻、木耳等土特产收的更多些……，把山区培育成富饶而又美丽的乐园。为了实现这个理想，到处都掀起了大生产运动。安康专区今年的小麦、胡豆亩产比去年增产30％，今年的秋季作物面积比往年扩大了，到处都有千斤稻、千斤玉米、千斤豆和万斤红薯丰产田。在汉中专区，今年夏季作物比去年增产20％以上，其它各种土特产，如橘子、茶叶、桐籽、漆等，今年也都将获得丰收。但是，人民群众的这种积极性，并没有得到省级各领导机关的重视和支持，相反的，由于省委以及各省级领导机关不注意加强对边沿地区的领导，而使人民群众建设社会主义的积极性受到影响。
    在六月二十七至七月五日举行的中共陕西省第二次代表大会上，来自边沿区的代表们，对省级领导机关的这些缺点提出了批评。
    边沿区的代表们普遍提出，长期看不到省级各部门负责人员深入边沿区检查工作，帮助解决问题。有些领导机关派下去的工作人员作风不好，他们下去后不但对边沿地区的工作没有多少帮助，而且在群众中留下很坏的印象。来自和湖北省交界的白河县的代表说，有一次省教育厅小学教育科派了一位同志去白河检查教育工作。当时，白河县人民委员会和中共县委会的工作人员都非常高兴，希望这位同志能够帮助解决一些当地教育工作中的问题。结果却使人非常失望，这个同志只看了看县城的小学，就对白河县领导上批评了一顿。后来，为了使他了解小学教育的全面情况，县里的同志要求他到山里的小学去看看。他嫌路远不愿意去；县上答应给他雇牲口，他说他不会骑；县上又说给他雇滑杆（一种像轿子一样的交通工具），他说没有时间。这种情况并不是个别的，有些领导机关派下来的工作人员就像是“钦差大臣”一样，看到一些鸡毛蒜皮的事就指手划脚地批评一通。
    省级领导人员经常不到边沿区去，派下去的工作人员又不深入工作，因此，省级各部门对边沿区的情况不熟悉，常常作出一些不符合边沿区实际情况的指示和决定。镇坪县的代表说，镇坪县大部分是山区，60％以上的山地都已经绿化，全县到处是森林。当前群众最迫切的要求是如何把现有的森林保护好。但是，省林业厅却决定要镇坪县植树造林十八万亩。镇坪县的群众问：把树栽到那里去呢？又如有些代表们反映有关部门指示要求这些地方在半年内消灭“四害”，要求村村都有球场！他们却没有想到在到处是高山森林的地方，怎么能够在半年内消灭“四害”，又怎么能够村村都找一块可以做球场的地方？
    边沿区把问题反映上来了，但是，领导机关却不能及时地处理，有的问题甚至拖了一年多也没有下落。很多代表在会议上批评了省级领导机关的这种作风。例如，1955年春天，四川省工业厅勘察队在南郑县碑坝区发现了磷矿，并且进行了详细的钻探工作。当时，南郑县委和县人民委员会分别报告省委和省人民委员会，请求开采这个磷矿，并且说明开采这个矿花钱不多，可是对汉中地区农业丰产运动有很重要的作用。以后，也催过多次，但是也没有结果。直到今年三月，四川省工业厅派来了厂长和建筑工人要正式建厂的时候，省里才决定由本省建厂开采。还有平利、紫阳、南郑一带的茶农，缺少揉茶用的细麻袋，曾向上边提过无数次的意见，长期得不到解决，白河县公路上有个涵洞坏了，修理费只要九百元，但是一直解决不了，后来还是由邻近的湖北省竹山县支出了这笔费用。
    有些代表说：省级各部门对边沿区更有一种错误看法，把边沿区的群众都看成是落后的。因此，不管什么事情都要把这些地方排在后边，例如给这些地方分配的干部常常是思想落后的，或者是犯了错误的。在陕南边沿区干部中流行着这样一句话：“不怕你调皮捣蛋，分配你到山区去锻炼”。其它如分配化学肥料、优良种籽等也存在着很多问题，这里一个县得到的化学肥料没有中心地区一个乡得到的多。是这些县不需要吗？不是的，各县都非常需要化学肥料，如平利县，今年搞万亩千斤稻丰产运动，其它工作都作得很好，就是缺乏肥料，而有关部门却不给解决。
    边沿地区的人民和工作人员，普遍感到省级各部门对他们的生活关心不够，如百货缺，物价贵，医疗卫生条件太差等。邻近这些县的四川、湖北等省的地区，同样都是边沿区，但物价和这一带相差很多，这就难怪群众要有意见。
    边沿地区群众生活中最痛苦的事情是疾病多，但是，各县的卫生院，大都设备非常简陋，因此有了病——特别是一些急性疾病就没有办法医治。虽然安康专区人民医院可以接受各县的病人，但是又和各县相距很远，交通不便，各县的病人实际上很难来这里治病。省领导部门并不是不知道这样情况。有时，省里卫生部门也派医疗人员下去，可是，这些人员吃不得苦，不愿在山区里工作。有一次，洵阳县麻疹流行的非常利害，最严重的区就有四、五百病人，可是，省里派下来的医疗人员因为吃不下苦，住了没几天就走了。这件事引起群众极大的不满。
    更令人气愤的是，有时下边把病人送到省里来，却没有人管。例如白河县的区委副书记王登发，得了精神病，白河县无法治疗，就要求送到安康人民医院。中共安康地委不同意，他们说省里的条件更好些，让送省委。中共白河县委就派干部王鹏远把王登发送到省委。想不到刚到省委组织部干部行政处，就被碰回来了。他们问是谁让把一个疯子送来的，硬说这样做不合组织手续，不予收留，甚至连招待所也不让住，叫他们住在旅馆里，并且声言如果出了问题，由王鹏远负责。最后，王鹏远只好把王登发送到陕北老家去。从那以后，白河县的工作人员要是有了病，宁可到湖北省襄阳专区去治，也不愿找地委和省委组织部了。
    现在正是调动一切积极因素，来提前和超额完成第一个五年计划的时候，代表们认为省委和各级领导部门一定要克服过去的缺点，加强对这些地区的具体领导。边沿区人民群众的积极性才能充分地发挥出来，用到建设社会主义社会的事业上。
