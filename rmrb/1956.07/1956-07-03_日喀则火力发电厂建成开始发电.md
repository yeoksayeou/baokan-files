    日喀则火力发电厂建成开始发电
    新华社日喀则2日电　西藏日喀则市人民热烈欢庆历史上第一个火力发电厂建成并开始发电。
    六月二十九日的黄昏，日喀则街头路灯大放光明，班禅额尔德尼的夏居地德庆颇章和扎什伦布寺的窗口里，也射出了耀眼的电灯光，这些建筑物显得更加雄伟。
    在庆贺电厂落成的典礼上，日喀则各界代表纷纷向修建电厂的工人献哈达和锦旗。班禅额尔德尼的代表尧西·公保才旦，在掌声中把“继续发扬工人阶级的创造性，为建设新的西藏奋斗”的大锦旗赠给电厂。中共西藏工委日喀则分工委书记梁选贤和班禅堪布会议厅委员会副主任委员纳旺金巴都讲了话。
    当天晚上，班禅额尔德尼对新华社记者说：“工人们工作都很好，我和日喀则的僧俗人民都很高兴。”在这以前，他和僧官苏吉堪布曾向工人赠送哈达表示感谢。
