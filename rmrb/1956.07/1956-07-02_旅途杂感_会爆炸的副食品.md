Travel Musings
Side Dishes That Explode
Sun Qian Hai Mo

    Zhongyuan City, the seat of the People's Committee of Lehui County, Hainan Island, is a beautiful town: the streets are quite wide, and the shops are painted snow-white. However, the shops here have no names, only some signs that are exactly the same in size and style. The signs read: "Metal Repair Production Cooperative Factory," "Comprehensive Service Store First Service Department," "Non-staple Food Store Third Outlet," "Supply and Marketing Cooperative Production Materials Outlet"...

    We wanted to get a haircut, but we didn't know where the barber shop was. We didn't understand Hainanese, so we had to search the streets. After searching the whole street, we finally found that its name had been changed to "Comprehensive Service Store First Service Department." It took us several days to figure out the truth. It turned out that all of this happened last December, during the transformation of private enterprises, as if everything changed suddenly after a gust of wind. We don't know where the leader of this private industrial and commercial transformation got his "inspiration" from. The barber shop is no longer called a barber shop, but "Comprehensive Service Store First and Second Service Department"; the laundry was changed to "Comprehensive Service Store Fourth Service Department"; the photo studio became another service department of the Comprehensive Service Store; the bicycle repair shop was changed to "Metal Repair Production Cooperative Factory"...

    And it's not just that. Later, we wanted to buy some cookies. According to the previous pattern, we thought there would be a "Non-staple Food Store Third Outlet," which would probably be correct. When we walked in, it turned out to be a pharmacy. Although the items on the shelves could be eaten, they were Chinese and Western medicines. This is truly a joke! Li Shizhen, the author of our ancient "Compendium of Materia Medica," probably never imagined that his later generations would classify medicines as side dishes.

    We went to the "Non-staple Food Store Second Outlet" to look for cookies. It was even stranger here: it was filled with clogs, iron wire, straw hats, and, strangest of all, firecrackers. Would the person who awarded the plaque to this store dare to eat this kind of explosive "side dish"?

    We couldn't "risk" it anymore, so we had to ask the county party secretary to "point us in the right direction." But the county party secretary said: "The county party committee rarely understands the situation." Perhaps he saw that we didn't quite believe him. The county party committee lives on the street. Unless the people of the county party committee never go to the street, or they always close their eyes when they go to the street, how could they not know the situation? He skirted the issue, saying, "The signs were put up last December, and we wanted to correct them in February this year, but we were too busy with drought relief work to take care of it."

    We believe that the county party committee may really be "concentrating its efforts on drought relief." However, one thing can probably be confirmed: if an agricultural cooperative that is suffering from drought wants to buy a waterwheel, then it must send a member who has studied "political economy" to the city, otherwise, how would he know to buy a waterwheel at the "means of production" store? In fact, even if this member who has studied "political economy" knows that waterwheels belong to the "means of production" category actually goes to the "Lehui County Supply and Marketing Cooperative Production Materials Outlet," he still cannot buy a waterwheel, because there are only pots, bowls, ladles, basins, and small stoves for cooking there - stoves are also means of production!

    旅途杂感
    会爆炸的副食品
    孙谦　海默
    海南岛乐会县人民委员会所在地——中原市，是一个漂亮的市镇：街面挺宽，店铺的房子粉刷得雪白。但是，这里的店铺没有字号，只有些大小、式样完全一样的招牌，招牌上写的是：“金属修理生产合作社工厂”、“综合服务店第一服务部”、“副食商店第三门市部”、“供销合作社生产资料门市部”……
    我们想理一理发，可是不知道理发店在那里。我们不懂海南话，只好遍街去找，一直找遍了全街，最后才发现原来它的名字已经改称为“综合服务店第一服务部”了。好几天以后，我们才弄清真相。原来这一切是在去年十二月间，私营企业改造时候，就像刮一阵风以后倏地变了样的。也不知道这位私营工商业改造的领导人从什么地方得来的“启发”，理发店不叫理发店了，叫“综合服务店第一、二服务部”；洗衣店改成了“综合服务店第四服务部”；照相馆成了综合服务店另外一个服务部；修理自行车的店子改成了“金属修理生产合作社工厂”……。
    还不仅如此。后来我们想买点饼干，我们想根据前面的规律，有一家“副食商店第三门市部”，大概不会错了吧。走进去一看，原来是一家药铺。货架上摆的虽然也可以吃，但却是中西药品。这真是千古笑话！我们古代的“本草纲目”的作者李时珍，大概从来也没有想到他的后世子孙会把药物划到副食品里去。
    我们又走进了“副食商店第二门市部”去找找饼干看。这里更怪：居然摆满了木屐、铁丝、草帽，最怪的还有炮仗。这种会爆炸的“副食”，也许给这家商店赐匾的人敢于吃它？
    我们不能再“冒险”了，只好请求县委书记给我们“指点一下”。但是县委书记却说：“县委很少了解情况。”也许他看出了我们不大相信他的话，县委就住在街上，除非县委会的人根本就不上街，要不就是上街时候常蒙着眼睛，不然怎么会不知道情况呢？他绕了个湾子说：“招牌是去年十二月搞的，今年二月就想把它纠正过来，可是抗旱工作一来，就忙得顾不上了。”
    我们相信县委也许真的在“集中力量抗旱”。但是，有一件事情大概也可以肯定的：如果有一个发生旱灾的农业社想买一架水车，那么他必需派一个读过“政治经济学”的社员到城里来，要不，他怎么晓得买水车要到“生产资料”商店里去买呢？其实就是这位读过“政治经济学”的，晓得水车是属于“生产资料”类的社员，真正地走到了“乐会县供销合作社生产资料门市部”，他也不能买到水车，因为那里只有锅、碗、瓢、盆，还有烧饭用的小火炉——火炉也是生产资料！
