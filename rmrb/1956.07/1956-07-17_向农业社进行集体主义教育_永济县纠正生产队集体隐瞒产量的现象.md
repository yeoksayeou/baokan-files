Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, July 13th: The Yongji County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, during the wheat distribution, paid attention to conducting collectivist education among agricultural cooperatives and promptly dealt with the problem of some agricultural cooperative production teams collectively concealing the actual wheat yield, thereby hindering the unified distribution of the entire cooperative.

The Sixth Production Team of the Shuguang Agricultural Cooperative in Chaoyang Township farmed eighty mu of wheat fields. The cooperative originally estimated a yield of eight thousand jin, but the actual harvest recently reached twelve thousand jin. The leading cadres of this team and some backward members, seeing that the actual yield was four thousand jin more than originally estimated, coveted partial and personal interests and concealed three thousand jin, privately distributing it among the team members. A total of eight production teams in the county's agricultural cooperatives were found to have collectively concealed or underreported the actual wheat yield to the cooperative, concealing over twenty thousand jin of wheat.

After discovering this situation, the Yongji County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party immediately dispatched working groups to conduct inspections and deal with the matter. At the Shuguang Agricultural Cooperative in Chaoyang Township, they specifically held a forum for cooperative members. Through the facts of the Sixth Production Team concealing the actual wheat yield and harming the collective interest, they conducted collectivist ideological education among the cadres and members of the cooperative, criticized selfish departmentalism, commended Communist Party member Wei Mengling and cooperative member Wei Hongli, who upheld the collective interest and fought against the erroneous behavior of concealing output, and the party member cadres who participated in the collective concealment of wheat were subjected to Party disciplinary action.

Currently, the cooperatives where the concealment of wheat output occurred have adopted the methods of the Shuguang Agricultural Cooperative and made respective arrangements. The cooperative members who participated in the eight cases of collective concealment of wheat throughout the county, after being educated, have turned over all the extra wheat they received to the cooperative for unified distribution. The Yongji County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, in order to educate the broad masses of Party members, also issued a circular to the Party's grassroots organizations throughout the county to learn from this lesson and strengthen the collectivist ideological education of Party members and cooperative members during the summer harvest distribution, and to fight for the sake of safeguarding the collective interests of the agricultural cooperatives.

    向农业社进行集体主义教育
    永济县纠正生产队集体隐瞒产量的现象
    新华社太原13日电　中共永济县委员会在小麦分配中注意向农业社进行集体主义教育，并且及时处理了某些农业社的生产队集体隐瞒小麦实产量妨害全社统一分配的问题。
    朝阳乡曙光农业社第六生产队经营的八十亩麦地，原来社里估产八千斤，在最近夏收中实产到一万二千斤。这个队的领导干部和一些落后社员看到实产量比原来估产量多了四千斤，便贪图局部和个人的利益，隐瞒了三千斤，私自在队内分配给社员。类似这个队向社里集体隐瞒或少报小麦实产量的生产队，在全县农业社里共发现八起，隐瞒小麦达两万斤以上。
    中共永济县委员会发现这种情况后，立即派出工作组进行检查处理，在朝阳乡曙光农业社专门开了社员座谈会，通过第六生产队隐瞒小麦实产量危害集体利益的事实，向社内干部和社员进行了集体主义的思想教育，批判了自私本位思想，表扬了维护集体利益向隐瞒产量的错误行为作斗争的共产党员魏孟令和社员魏宏礼，参与集体隐瞒小麦的党员干部受到了党纪处分。
    现在，发生隐瞒小麦产量的社都采取了曙光农业社的办法，分别作了处理。全县参加八起集体隐瞒小麦的社员，在受到教育后已经把多分的麦子全部交给社统一分配。中共永济县委会为教育广大党员，也通报全县党的基层组织接受这一教训，在夏收分配中加强对党员、社员的集体主义思想教育，为维护农业社的集体利益而斗争。
