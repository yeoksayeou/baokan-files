	Is it Care or Discrimination?
	Ge Xian

	For the past two years, the Beijing Public Transportation Company has not recruited any women to work, because it believes that women have too many things to deal with, and after getting married, they have to have children. To avoid these troubles, the leadership issued a ban stating “no female workers will be hired under any circumstances.” It is said that this is to “fundamentally achieve the goal of truly safeguarding the interests of female workers.” Therefore, from September 1954 until now, not a single woman has been among the more than 500 employees recruited by the Public Transportation Company.

	Even some of the female workers recruited two years ago have now caused headaches for some of the company's leaders. Today, this one is pregnant, tomorrow that one is giving birth... all require care.

	Let's see how the leaders of the Public Transportation Company "care" for them!

	One day, I was in the trade union office of the First Maintenance Depot of the Public Transportation Company and saw a pregnant female comrade staring listlessly out the window. The chairman of the trade union told me that she had been "removed from her shift." Her name is Ma Chaojun, and she used to be a ticket seller on the No. 8 bus. Ma Chaojun said embarrassedly, "I can't get involved in the work, and I don't have a fixed position. Look at me, I've become a waste product!" Indeed, Ma Chaojun often doesn't know what work she should do in the afternoon, or what she will be assigned to do tomorrow. Perhaps she has no work to do for half a day. Feeling really bored, Ma Chaojun can only carry a kettle to fetch hot water and wipe the table with a rag. Ma Chaojun spends her days in this kind of care, until she gives birth to her child.

	What's going on? It turns out that the Public Transportation Company has a rule that as soon as a female ticket seller or female driver is found to be pregnant, she is removed from her shift. If a female worker is pregnant and not suitable for working on the bus, her job can and should be changed. But they cannot be removed arbitrarily, and after they are removed, their work is not properly arranged. After each department puts up a "full quota" sign, these women can only become "superfluous," only able to help answer the phone or sell meal tickets. One pregnant female driver has been removed from her shift for half a month and has not even been assigned any "odd jobs." Speaking of these things, Ma Chaojun said with deep feeling, "Think about it, which young woman doesn't want to make progress? Is there anything more painful than being treated as 'waste'?"

	Once a female worker gives birth, the leadership's "care" is over. After the maternity leave is over, she has to work the same as men. This creates a problem with breastfeeding. Liang Yuzhen, a ticket seller, gave birth to a child, and no one at home could take care of the child. She was penalized with suspension without pay for not being on time for work. After Liang Yuzhen went to work, breastfeeding her child became a problem. It just so happened that this child had to have her mother's milk and wouldn't eat milk in any form. What mother doesn't love her child? Although Liang Yuzhen's income was not high, she still bought milk, milk powder, condensed milk, and milk cakes. However, the child was still thin, and Liang Yuzhen poured cup after cup of her milk onto the ground. Because of the lack of breast milk, the child was very weak and often got sick. Liang Yuzhen couldn't help but sigh deeply when she said, "I am now enjoying the 'care' of being removed from my shift again. After being removed from my shift..." She didn't say any more.

	Pregnancy, removal from the shift; giving birth, going to work; the leadership sees these things as very simple. Little do they know that there are many problems here! Female comrades not only have the desire to take care of housework and children, but they also have the desire to improve their skills and learn culture! But the leadership seems to rarely consider these things. Some female ticket sellers want to learn to be drivers, but instead of being welcomed, they are ridiculed and obstructed: "Go take care of the children! You still want to be a driver?" So now, out of nearly a thousand drivers in the company, there are only seven female drivers.

	The Public Transportation Company's decision not to recruit female workers is supported and approved by the Beijing Public Utility Bureau. As late as June 11 this year, in a document to the Women Workers Department of the Beijing Federation of Trade Unions, the Public Utility Bureau stated that working on the bus is harmful to the physiological functions of female workers, that breastfeeding is difficult and detrimental to the health of mothers and children, and that if they are transferred to work in the factory after becoming pregnant, they cannot handle the work due to their limited cultural and professional level. Therefore, in the future, the two companies (Electric Trolley Company and Public Transportation Company) should recruit as few female workers as possible when hiring drivers and ticket sellers, or not recruit them at all.

	Of course, working on the bus while pregnant or after giving birth is difficult. However, as long as the leadership can actively find solutions, the difficulties are not insurmountable, but the Public Transportation Company is only annoyed and discriminatory towards them, and even simply refuses to let them in the door.

	I heard that the leaders of the Public Transportation Company are now preparing to solve the difficulties of female workers and are also preparing to consider recruiting women to work, which is a welcome change. I hope they will not just talk and think, but take concrete measures to solve the problem.

### 是照顾还是歧视？

    是照顾还是歧视？
    葛娴
    北京市公共汽车公司近二年来没有招收一个妇女参加工作，原因是认为妇女事情多，结了婚又要生孩子，为了免去这些麻烦起见，领导上就下了一道“一律不招用女工”的禁令。据说这是为了从“根本上达到真正维护女工利益的目的”。因此，从1954年9月，直到现在，公共汽车公司在录用的五百多个职工中，就没有一个女的。
    就是在二年以前录用的一些女工，现在也已经使公司的某些领导同志伤透脑筋了。今天这个怀孕、明天那个生孩子……都需要照顾。
    且看公共汽车公司的领导者是怎样来“照顾”她们的吧！
    一天，我在公共汽车公司第一保养场的工会办公室里，看见一个怀孕的女同志在无聊地望着窗户。工会主席告诉我，她是被“撤班”下来的，她叫马超俊，原来在第八路公共汽车上当售票员。马超俊不好意思地说：“工作插不上手，也没有一个固定的职务，瞧我成了浪费品啦！”真的，马超俊常常是上午不知下午应干什么工作，或者今天不知明天会被分配做什么事情，也许整半天没一点活干。闲得实在无聊，马超俊就只有提个壶打点开水，拿个抹布擦桌子。马超俊就在这样的照顾下，一天天地过去，要一直到生了孩子为止。
    这是怎么一回事呢？原来公共汽车公司有这么个规矩，一发现那个女售票员或女司机怀了孕，就把她从班上撤下来。女工怀了孕，不适于在车上工作，可以也应该调换一下工作。但是不能把她们随便撤下来，撤下来以后，对她们的工作不进行妥善的安排。在各科室对她们挂了“满额”的招牌以后，这些就只能成为“多余者”，只能帮人接接电话，卖卖饭票。其中有一个怀孕的女司机，已撤下来半个月，连“零活”都没分配到。谈起这些来，马超俊深有所感地说：“想想看，哪个女青年不要求进步？还有什么比当成‘废品’更痛苦的事？”
    女工生了孩子，领导上的“照顾”也就完了。产假满了一上班，就得男女同样干，这样，喂奶就成了问题。售票员梁玉珍生了孩子，家中无人照应，没有准时上班，就受到了停薪留职的处分。梁玉珍上班以后，给孩子喂奶又成了问题。恰恰这个孩子又非要吃妈妈的奶不可，牛奶怎么也不爱吃。哪个妈妈不疼孩子，梁玉珍虽然收入不多，还是买了牛奶，又买奶粉，买了炼乳，又买奶糕，然而，孩子还是瘦了，而梁玉珍的奶却一杯杯地挤出往地上倒。因为缺少母奶，这个孩子体质很弱，常常闹病。梁玉珍说到这里，不禁深深叹一口气：“我现在又一次在享受撤班的‘照顾’了，撤班以后……”她没有再说下去。
    怀孕，撤班；生了孩子，上班；领导上把这些看得很简单。殊不知这里面问题重重啊！女同志不仅有搞好家务、带好孩子的要求，她还有提高技术、学好文化的要求哩！而领导上却似乎很少考虑这些。有些女售票员想去学当司机，她们受到的不是欢迎而是讽刺和阻挠：“看孩子去吧！还想当司机？”所以现在全公司近一千个司机中，女司机只有七个。
    公共汽车公司不招收女工，是得到北京市公用局的支持和批准的。直到今年六月十一日，公用局在给北京市工会联合会女工部的一项公文中，还说明在车上工作如何如何有害女工的生理机能，哺乳又很困难，有碍母子健康，若怀了孕调往厂内工作，又因文化业务水平的限制，不能胜任，因此今后二公司（电车公司和公共汽车公司）招录司机和售票人员的时候要尽量少招或不招女工。
    当然，怀了孕、生了孩子在车上工作是有困难的。但是，只要领导上能够积极想办法，困难并不是不能克服的，而公共汽车公司却只是对她们厌烦、歧视，甚至干脆拒绝她们入门。
    听说现在公共汽车公司的领导上准备着手解决女工的困难，也准备考虑吸收妇女参加工作，这是一种值得欢迎的转变。我希望他们不要只是说说想想，而要切切实实地采取措施解决问题。
