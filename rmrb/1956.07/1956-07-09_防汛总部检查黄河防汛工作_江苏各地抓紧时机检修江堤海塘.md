Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 8th. The Central Flood Control Headquarters has dispatched an inspection team to inspect the Yellow River flood control work. They departed from Zhengzhou on the 6th for a month-long inspection of the river defense lines in Henan and Shandong. The inspection includes key defensive sections of the dikes, the diversion gates at Dagong and Shitou Zhuang, and the preparatory work in the detention areas between the Beijin Dike and the Linhuang Dike, and Dongping Lake.

Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou. The dike construction and annual maintenance project for defending against extraordinary floods in the lower reaches of the Yellow River was completed at the end of June. This project was undertaken to defend against extraordinary floods occurring before the completion of the Sanmenxia and Yi River and Luo River reservoirs. After the completion of this project, in the event of an extraordinary flood, it can cooperate with the flood diversion projects at Shitou Zhuang spillway and other places to avoid serious breaches and changes in the course of the Yellow River in the lower reaches.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 7th. Various parts of Jiangsu Province, located on the coast and in the lower reaches of the Yangtze and Huai Rivers, are seizing the favorable opportunity during the lull in the flood season and the sunny weather to inspect and repair river embankments and seawalls.

The Yangzhou Special District mobilized more than 28,000 people to actively remove reeds and reeds that obstruct water diversion, and used dredgers to excavate underwater earth and stone from the old dams of the Huai River, expanding the flow of the Huai River into the Yangtze River. As a result, the flow of the Huai River into the Yangtze River has increased from 2,300 cubic meters per second on June 12 to more than 5,700 cubic meters per second, allowing the water level of Hongze Lake in the lower reaches of the Huai River to continue to decrease.

Emergency repairs have also been carried out on seawalls, sea dikes, and river embankments that play an important role in preventing tides and typhoons. The Nantong and Yangzhou Special Districts alone have completed more than 3.7 million cubic meters of earthwork for emergency repairs. The river embankment in Qidong County has been universally raised by five centimeters.

    防汛总部检查黄河防汛工作 
    江苏各地抓紧时机检修江堤海塘
    新华社郑州8日电　中央防汛总指挥部派出检查黄河防汛工作的检查组，已经在六日从郑州转赴河南、山东沿河河防线，作为期一个月的检查。检查内容包括几个重点防守的堤段，大功和石头庄等分洪口门以及北金堤和临黄堤之间和东平湖等滞洪区的准备工作。
    据新华社郑州电　黄河下游防御特大洪水的修堤和岁修工程已经在六月底完成。这一工程是为了防御在三门峡和伊河、洛河水库完成以前发生的特大洪水而进行的。这一工程修成后，如遇特大洪水，便可在石头庄溢洪堰等处分洪工程的配合下避免黄河下游发生严重的溃决和改道。
    新华社南京7日电　地处滨海和长江淮河下游的江苏各地，抓紧汛期空隙和天晴的有利时机检修江堤海塘。
    扬州专区动员了两万八千多人积极割除引水障碍的芦柴，用挖泥船开挖淮河旧江各坝的水下土方，扩大了淮河入江的流量。这样，淮河入江流量已从六月十二日的两千三百个秒公方增加到五千七百多个秒公方，使淮河下游的洪泽湖水位继续降低。
    对防潮、防台风具有重要作用的海塘、海堤、江堤也进行了抢修，仅南通、扬州二个专区就抢修完成土方三百七十多万公方。启东县的江堤，普遍加高了五公寸。
