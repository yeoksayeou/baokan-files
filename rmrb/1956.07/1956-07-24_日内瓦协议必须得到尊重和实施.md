    It has been more than two years since the signing of the Geneva Accords on the restoration of peace in Indochina. The signing of the Geneva Accords ended the eight-year Indochina War and ensured that the national rights of peace, independence, democracy, and unification of the Indochinese people were recognized and respected.

    Over the past two years, the military clauses of the Geneva Accords regarding the cessation of hostilities in Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia have been implemented or largely implemented. This is the result of the joint efforts of all parties concerned in overcoming the obstruction of certain forces. It should be pointed out that the International Commission for Supervision and Control in Indochina has made valuable contributions in this regard. The implementation of the ceasefire clauses of the Geneva Accords has enabled the people of Indochina to get rid of the long-term war disaster and frustrated the US attempt to expand the Indochina War, thereby easing the tension in Asia.

    However, regarding the implementation of the political clauses stipulated in the Geneva Accords, that is, the realization of peaceful unification of these countries through general elections in the three countries of Indochina, there are still difficulties in Vietnam and Laos, except for Cambodia. Especially in Vietnam, due to the open obstruction and sabotage by the United States, the issue of peaceful consultation and unification of Vietnam is being unduly delayed.

    In Cambodia, the relevant clauses of the Geneva Accords have been implemented. Cambodia has emerged on the international stage as an independent country. The Royal Government and people of Cambodia, adhering to a policy of neutrality based on compliance with the Geneva Accords, and peacefully coexisting and cooperating in a friendly manner with other countries, have strengthened its domestic unity and are playing an active role in international affairs.

    In Laos, the Royal Lao Government and the Lao Fighting Units have not yet reached agreement on the implementation of several issues of political settlement. However, both sides have repeatedly expressed their willingness to fully implement the Geneva Accords and seek the peaceful unification of their motherland. Recently, both sides have expressed a conciliatory attitude and are preparing to resume their consultations. People expect them to strive for the early and full implementation of the Geneva Accords and the restoration of the peaceful unification of Laos in a spirit of mutual tolerance and consultative cooperation.

    The serious problem is in Vietnam. According to the Geneva Accords, Vietnam should hold nationwide free elections in July this year to achieve peaceful unification; the responsible authorities of both North and South Vietnam should have begun consultations a year ago to arrange this general election. However, for more than a year, although the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has constantly taken the initiative to request consultations with the South Vietnamese authorities on the issue of holding general elections, the latter has been unreasonably refusing, making it impossible to realize the general election and unification. Not only that, the clauses in the Geneva Accords regarding the prohibition of the introduction of foreign military personnel and war materials into Vietnam and the prohibition of retaliation and discrimination against former resistance personnel, which guaranteed the stability of the ceasefire, have also been openly violated in South Vietnam. In a letter to the British Foreign Secretary on May 22, the South Vietnamese authorities said that it would respect the provisional military demarcation line and the demilitarized zone stipulated in the Geneva Accords, and would cooperate with the International Commission, but at the same time it declared that it was "not bound by the Geneva Accords," attempting to refuse to implement nationwide free elections. In this letter, the South Vietnamese authorities avoided answering the question raised by the two chairmen regarding the timing of the start of consultations between North and South Vietnam and the timing of the nationwide elections.

    The attitude of the South Vietnamese authorities in openly resisting the implementation of the Geneva Accords regarding the holding of nationwide free elections is clearly the result of instigation and encouragement by the United States. Everyone knows that in order to turn Indochina into its military base and maintain and intensify tensions in Asia, the United States has been obstructing and undermining the implementation of the Geneva Accords. The United States has not only included South Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia in the "protected area" of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, preparing for military intervention in Indochina, but also openly interfered in the internal affairs of the Indochinese countries. The United States has put pressure on Cambodia to abandon its policy of peace and independence. US Secretary of State Dulles even instigated the Royal Lao Government to launch an attack on the Lao Resistance Forces. The United States is particularly actively engaged in a conspiracy to split Vietnam and obstruct the peaceful unification of Vietnam. On the one hand, the United States, disregarding the Geneva Accords, has sent thousands of American military personnel and a large number of war materials to South Vietnam to strengthen the war machine of the Ngo Dinh Diem clique; on the other hand, it has squeezed out France, controlled the Ngo Dinh Diem clique in all aspects, and instructed it to resist the realization of general elections and the peaceful unification of Vietnam.

    The US actions of undermining the Geneva Accords and deliberately splitting Vietnam cannot but arouse the indignation of the Vietnamese people and peace-loving people of all countries. The United States is replacing France in implementing colonial rule in South Vietnam, turning South Vietnam into a US military base, and refusing to recognize the national rights of the Vietnamese people to peace, independence, and unification. This shows that the United States is a vicious and greedy colonialist, and that the United States is determined to create tension in Indochina and Asia. The US obstruction of the peaceful unification of Vietnam is, in fact, a serious provocation to all people in Asia who are striving for peace and independence.

    The government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has made many efforts for the peaceful unification of Vietnam. On July 13, Prime Minister Pham Van Dong of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam wrote to the two chairmen of the Geneva Conference, reiterating the position of resolutely implementing the Geneva Accords and requesting the two chairmen to take necessary measures to ensure that consultations and general elections in Vietnam can be conducted. Three million people in North Vietnam have signed petitions demanding the realization of general elections and unification, and the people of South Vietnam are also constantly struggling for peaceful unification. The Vietnamese people's strong will to unify their motherland is irresistible. It will inevitably lead to the failure of the US conspiracy to obstruct the unification of Vietnam.

    Our people have always had the greatest sympathy and support for the Vietnamese people's desire for the peaceful unification of their motherland. Our country is one of the countries that participated in the Geneva Conference, and naturally, we cannot but pay great attention to guaranteeing the implementation of the Geneva Accords and safeguarding peace in Indochina. We believe that the two proposals put forward by President Ho Chi Minh in his letter to the people of Vietnam on July 6 are important steps towards realizing the peaceful unification of Vietnam. These two proposals are: 1. Restore normal relations and freedom of travel between the two regions of North and South Vietnam; create conditions for various political, economic, cultural, and social organizations in the North and South to contact each other. 2. Convene a consultative conference including representatives of both regimes to discuss the issue of free elections aimed at unifying the country on the basis of the Geneva Accords. In a letter to British Foreign Secretary Lloyd on May 22, Foreign Minister Vu Van Mau of South Vietnam said that the South Vietnamese authorities also believe that it is necessary to seek practical solutions to the problems raised by the Geneva Accords for Vietnam. If these words have any sincerity, the South Vietnamese authorities have no reason to reject the two proposals put forward by President Ho Chi Minh. The Soviet government, as one of the chairmen of the Geneva Conference, has proposed to the British government on July 21 that the two chairmen should once again advise the South Vietnamese authorities to immediately express their views on the timing of the start of consultations and the timing of holding general elections. The Chinese people fully support this proposal of the Soviet government. We believe that for the independence and freedom of the people of Indochina and for peace in Asia and the world, the Geneva Accords must be respected and implemented.

### 日内瓦协议必须得到尊重和实施

    日内瓦协议必须得到尊重和实施
    自从恢复印度支那和平的日内瓦协议签订以来，已经两年多过去了。日内瓦协议的签订，结束了历时八年的印度支那战争，使印度支那人民的和平、独立、民主、统一的民族权利得到了承认和尊重。
    在过去两年多时间中，日内瓦协议关于在越南、老挝和柬埔寨停止敌对行动的各项军事条款，都已经实现或基本上已经实现。这是有关各方克服了某些势力的阻挠，共同努力的结果。应当指出，监督印度支那停战的国际委员会在这方面作出了极有价值的贡献。日内瓦协议中停战条款的实现，使得印度支那各国人民摆脱了长期的战争灾难，挫败了美国企图扩大印度支那战争的阴谋，从而缓和了亚洲的紧张局势。
    但是，在实现日内瓦协议所规定的政治条款方面，也就是在印度支那三国分别实行普选来求得这些国家的和平统一方面，除了柬埔寨以外，在越南和老挝都还存在着困难。特别在越南，由于美国的公开阻挠和破坏，通过和平协商统一越南的问题正在遭到不应有的拖延。
    在柬埔寨，日内瓦协议的有关条款都得到了实现。柬埔寨已经作为一个独立的国家出现在国际舞台上。柬埔寨王国政府和人民在遵守日内瓦协议的基础上坚持奉行中立政策，同其他国家和平共处，友好合作，因此它的国内团结加强了，它在国际事务中也正在起着积极的作用。
    在老挝方面，老挝王国政府和寮国战斗部队在实现政治解决的若干问题上还未能取得一致。但是，双方都再三表示具有全部履行日内瓦协议和谋求和平统一祖国的意愿。最近，双方都表示了和解的态度，并正在准备恢复双方的协商。人们期望它们都能本着互相容忍的精神和协商合作的态度，争取早日全部实现日内瓦协议，恢复老挝的和平统一。
    严重的问题是在越南。依照日内瓦协议，越南应在今年七月举行全国自由普选以实现和平统一；越南南北双方的负责当局，在一年前就应开始为安排这一普选进行协商。可是，一年多来，虽然越南民主共和国政府不断地主动要求同越南南方当局就举行普选问题进行协商，但是后者却一直无理拒绝，使得普选和统一无法实现。不但这样，日内瓦协议中关于禁止向越南运入外国军事人员和作战物资、禁止对前抗战人员施行报复歧视等保障停战稳定的条款，在越南南部也遭到了公开的破坏。越南南方当局在五月二十二日给英国外交大臣的信中说，它将尊重日内瓦协议所规定的临时军事分界线和非军事区，并且将同国际委员会合作，但是它却又同时宣称它“不受日内瓦协议的约束”，企图拒绝实行全国的自由普选。南越当局在这封信中对于两位主席所提出的关于越南南北双方开始协商和举行全国选举的时间问题，更避而不作答复。
    越南南方当局这种公开抗拒履行日内瓦协议关于举行全国自由选举的规定的态度，显然是美国嗾使和鼓励的结果。谁都知道，美国为了把印度支那变成它的军事基地，在亚洲保持和加剧紧张局势，一直在阻挠和破坏日内瓦协议的实施。美国不但把越南南部、老挝和柬埔寨划入东南亚军事集团的“保护地区”，为对印度支那进行军事干涉作好准备，而且公开干涉印度支那各国的内政。美国曾经对柬埔寨施加压力，要它放弃和平独立的政策。美国国务卿杜勒斯甚至曾经嗾使老挝王国政府对寮国抗战部队发动进攻。美国特别积极地进行分裂越南、阻挠越南和平统一的阴谋。美国一方面不顾日内瓦协议，向越南南部派入成千的美国军事人员，运入大批的作战物资，加强吴庭艳集团的战争机器；另一方面它挤走了法国，从各方面控制吴庭艳集团，指使它抗拒实现普选和越南的和平统一。
    美国破坏日内瓦协议蓄意分裂越南的这种行径，不能不引起越南人民和各国爱好和平的人民的愤慨。美国代替法国在越南南部实行殖民统治，把越南南部变成美国的军事基地，拒绝承认越南人民的和平、独立、统一的民族权利，这就说明美国是一个凶恶而贪婪的殖民主义者，说明美国决心要在印度支那和亚洲制造紧张局势。美国阻挠越南和平统一，实际上是对亚洲一切争取和平和独立的人民的一个严重的挑衅。
    为了越南的和平统一，越南民主共和国政府已经作了多次的努力。越南民主共和国范文同总理在七月十三日又写信给日内瓦会议两位主席，重申坚决贯彻日内瓦协定的立场，要求两位主席采取必要的措施，使越南的协商和普选得以进行。越南北部已有三百万人签名要求实现普选和统一，越南南部人民也在不断地为争取和平统一而进行斗争。越南人民这种强烈的统一祖国的意志是不可抗拒的。它必然将使美国阻挠越南统一的阴谋遭到失败。
    我国人民对于越南人民要求和平统一祖国的愿望，一向抱有最大的同情和支持。我国是参加日内瓦会议的国家之一，对于保证日内瓦协议的实施和维护印度支那的和平，自然不能不予以极大的关心。我们认为，胡志明主席在七月六日告越南全国人民书中提出的两点主张，是实现越南和平统一的重要步骤。这两点主张就是：一、恢复越南南北两个地区之间的正常关系和往来的自由；为北方和南方的各个政治、经济、文化、社会等团体得以互相联系创造条件。二、召开包括双方政权代表的协商会议，来讨论目的在日内瓦协定的基础上统一国家的自由普选问题。南越当局的外交部长武文牡在五月二十二日给英国外交大臣劳埃德的信中曾经说，南越当局也认为有必要寻求日内瓦协议对越南所提出的问题的实际解决办法。如果这些话具有任何诚意的话，南越当局就没有理由拒绝胡志明主席所提出的两点主张。苏联政府，作为日内瓦会议的主席之一，已经在七月二十一日向英国政府提出，两位主席应该再一次建议南越当局立即表示自己对开始协商的时间和举行普选的时间的意见。中国人民完全支持苏联政府的这一主张。我们认为，为了印度支那各国人民的独立和自由，为了亚洲和世界的和平，日内瓦协议必须得到尊重和实施。
