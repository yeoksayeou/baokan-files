    Are They Useless People?
    To the Editor:
    Just as our motherland is striding forward towards socialism, every young person wants to dedicate their youth to this magnificent cause. Dong Chengxing, a student who graduated from Dalian No. 2 Junior High School in 1955, is one such youth. However, because he has a slight physical defect, he has suffered coldness and discrimination from all sides for the past year.
    Dong Chengxing is twenty years old this year, and his father is an old printing worker. In 1945, while herding cattle in the wild, he lost his right hand to a Kuomintang landmine. This, of course, caused him great pain, but after liberation, thanks to the care of the Party and the school, he forgot his physical pain and studied hard. Therefore, his academic performance at school was generally "good," and he also exercised well, even being the champion of the school's 100-meter and 200-meter races.
    When he was about to graduate, the school, based on his aspirations, strengths, and physical condition, recommended him to apply to the Northeast Academy of Fine Arts. Who knew that this school would say that he was a useless person and would not approve his application. Later, the Dalian City Zhongshan District Committee of the Communist Youth League introduced him to the Dalian Shipyard Industrial School to take the drafting class, but a comrade at the school's registration office said: "A girl is better than you, a disabled person."
    The school doors were tightly closed to him, so he decided to find a job. Since last August, he has written and visited the Dalian City Labor Bureau and the Zhongshan District Labor Section several times, requesting job placement. However, he did not expect that the City Labor Bureau's attitude towards him was also very cold, pushing him to the District Labor Section, which also used the excuse that "you are disabled and cannot do anything" to refuse to help him find a job. Later, he wrote to the Lüda Daily. The Lüda Daily transferred the matter to the Zhongshan District People's Committee for handling. The People's Committee still handed it over to the District Labor Section, and the problem remained unresolved. After some time, Dong Chengxing heard that the Dalian Maritime School's canteen management section needed people, so he asked the Labor Section for an introduction. The Labor Section reluctantly gave him a letter of introduction, without detailing his situation. The Maritime School saw that he was missing an arm and was also very cold and discriminatory towards him. A Comrade Shang from the Maritime School's canteen management section said, "Why would we want a disabled person like you?" One blow after another did not diminish his enthusiasm for participating in work. After a few days, he applied to the Dalian Dye Factory as a laboratory technician. A week after submitting his resume, he received a notice asking him to attend a meeting. How happy he was! But when the time came, the comrades at the dye factory asked him about the cause of his disability and had him do some gymnastics. Everything was fine, but the dye factory still didn't want him.
    According to our understanding, there are now more than ten junior high school graduates with disabilities in Dalian City's Zhongshan District and Shahekou District who have not been placed. Among them, four have had experiences similar to Dong Chengxing's. We believe that although young people like Dong Chengxing have some physical defects, they still have healthy thoughts and healthy physiques, and they can do a lot of work. Therefore, state organs should care for them and give them work, and should not adopt a cold and discriminatory attitude towards them.

### 他们难道是没用的人吗

    他们难道是没用的人吗编辑同志：
    正当我们的祖国迈着大步向社会主义进军的时候，每个青年人都想把自己的青春贡献给这个壮丽的事业，1955年毕业于大连市第二初级中学的学生董成兴就是这样的青年当中的一个。但是，因为他生理上有一点缺陷，一年来受尽了各方面的冷淡和歧视。
    董成兴今年二十岁，父亲是个老印刷工人。1945年，他在野外放牛的时候，被国民党的地雷炸去了一只右手。这当然给了他极大的痛苦，但解放以后，由于党和学校的关怀，使他忘掉了生理上的痛苦而努力学习。因此，他在校的学习成绩一般都是“良好”，身体也锻炼的很好，还是全校一百公尺和二百公尺赛跑的冠军。
    临毕业的时候学校里根据他的志愿、特长和身体条件，介绍他去投考东北美术专科学校。谁知这个学校说他是一个没用的人，就没有批准他投考。后来，青年团大连市中山区委会就介绍他到大连船渠工业学校考制图班，这个学校报名处的一个同志又说：“要一个女生也比你这残废人强。”
    学校的门对他关的紧紧的，他就决定找一个工作做。从去年八月他曾几次给大连市劳动局和中山区劳动科写信和前往面谈，请求介绍职业。但是他没有想到，市劳动局对他的态度也很冷淡，把他推给区劳动科，区劳动科也借口“你是残废人，什么都不能干”不给介绍职业。后来，他写信给旅大日报。旅大日报转请中山区人民委员会处理。人民委员会仍交给区劳动科，结果问题还是得不到解决。过了一些时候，董成兴听说大连海校食堂管理科要人，就去请求劳动科介绍。劳动科勉强给他开了一个介绍信，并没有详细地介绍他的情形。海校看到他缺一个胳膊，对他也十分冷淡和歧视。海校食堂管理科的一位商同志说：“我们为什么要你这样的残废人呢？”一次又一次的打击，并没有使他减低参加工作的热情。过了些日子，他又去投考大连染料厂的化验员。送去履历表后一个星期，他接到了要他去开会的通知。他是多么高兴啊。可是到时候，染料厂的同志询问了他残废的原因，让他作了一段体操，一切很好，但是染料厂还是不要他。
    据我们了解，现在大连市中山区和沙河口区，还有十多名有残疾的初中毕业生没有得到安置。其中有四人和董成兴的遭遇差不多。我们认为，像董成兴这样的青年，生理上虽然有些缺陷，但是他们还有着健康的思想和健康的体质，他们还可以做很多工作。因此国家机关应当十分关怀他们，给他们以工作，不应当对他们采取冷淡和歧视的态度。
