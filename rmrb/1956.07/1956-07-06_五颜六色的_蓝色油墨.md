    Colorful "Blue Ink"
    Blue ink, as the name implies, should of course be blue. However, the Jixing brand blue ink produced by the Tianjin No. 545 Factory that we bought in June had some that were purplish and some that were greenish. Users are unwilling to accept items printed with this kind of colorful "blue ink." This has made the more than 1,460 jin of ink we bought for 6,200 yuan unusable for production, disrupted our production plans, and affected the work of our users.
    Similar situations have occurred in the past, and we have submitted written opinions to the Tianjin No. 545 Factory, asking them to improve, but they have consistently ignored them. We demand that the No. 545 Factory seriously address this issue and quickly improve product quality.

### 五颜六色的“蓝色油墨”

    五颜六色的“蓝色油墨”
    蓝色油墨，顾名思义当然是蓝色的。可是六月份我们买来的天津五四五厂出产的机星牌蓝色油墨，里面却有带紫色的，也有带绿色的。用这种五颜六色的“蓝色油墨”印出来的东西，用户都不愿意要。这使我们花了六千二百多元买来的一千四百六十多斤油墨无法投入生产，打乱了生产计划，也影响了用户的工作。
    类似的情况，过去就曾发生过，我们也曾向天津五四五厂提过书面意见，请他们改进，但他们一直置之不理。我们要求五四五厂认真解决这个问题，迅速提高产品质量。
