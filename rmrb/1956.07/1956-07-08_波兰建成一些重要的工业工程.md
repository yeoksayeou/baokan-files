Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw Dispatch: Poland has recently completed a number of new and important industrial projects.

    The first iron mine in Poland's young Więcławice iron ore district (Łódź Province) has begun production. Miners have already extracted the first batch of iron ore. The other five iron mines in this mining area are under construction. In the near future, the Więcławice mining area, which has reserves of 100 million tons, will become Poland's largest ferrous metallurgy base.

    Construction workers at the Nowa Huta Lenin Metallurgical Combine recently completed the installation of the fifth open-hearth furnace. The equipment of the new open-hearth furnace is currently being tested, and it will soon be able to produce its first batch of steel.

    The fourth turbine generator unit with a generating capacity of 30,000 kilowatts at the Żerań Power Plant in Warsaw has been installed. It was installed in six months, which is faster than the installation of previous turbines. Within a few days, this generator unit will be officially put into production to supply electricity to industrial enterprises and residential areas in the Polish capital. This power plant will also install two more turbine generator units this year.

    The new knitting factory in the city of Sieradz, which is under construction, is also nearing completion. In a few weeks, this new factory will be able to manufacture its first batch of products.

    波兰建成一些重要的工业工程
    新华社华沙电　波兰最近建成了一些新的重要的工业工程。
    波兰年青的维契查铁矿区（罗兹省）的第一个铁矿已经开始生产。矿工们已经开采了第一批铁矿。这个矿区的另外五个铁矿正在建筑中。不久的将来，这个蕴藏量有一亿吨的维契查矿区，将成为波兰最大的黑色冶金基地。
    诺瓦胡塔列宁冶金联合企业的建筑人员，最近完成了第五座平炉的安装工作。现在正在试验新平炉的装备，不久它就可以炼出第一炉钢了。
    华沙泽兰电力厂的第四台发电能力为三万瓩的涡轮联动机已经安装完毕。这是用六个月的时间安装的，比以前几个涡轮机的安装都要快。几天之内，这台联动机就将正式投入生产，向波兰首都的工业企业和住宅区供电。今年这个电力厂还要安装两台涡轮联动机。
    正在建筑的谢拉兹城的新针织厂也已经接近完工，再过几个星期，这个新工厂就可以制造出第一批产品了。
