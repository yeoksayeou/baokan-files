Xinhua News Agency, Hegang, 6th July. The Xing'an Platform Shaft in the Hegang Coal Mine has been completed and is currently in trial production. Soon, this new type of shaft will be officially put into production.

The Xing'an Platform Shaft was designed with Soviet assistance, and its main equipment was also supplied by the Soviet Union. Therefore, like the new-type shafts built in various places, it is a highly mechanized shaft.

The Xing'an Platform Shaft is the second pair of large-scale shafts built by the Hegang Coal Mine after the Dongshan Shaft was put into production. The output of this pair of shafts is two-fifths larger than that of the Dongshan Shaft, and the amount of construction and installation work has also increased significantly. However, its construction time only took four years, more than a year earlier than the Dongshan Shaft.

The completion of the Xing'an Platform Shaft has enabled the Hegang well-building team, which has built two pairs of shafts in succession, to grow rapidly. They have not only achieved fast speed, but also achieved good results with economy. In the current trial production of the Xing'an Platform Shaft, except for a small accident with a small motor, all other equipment is operating normally. During the well-building process, they also adopted advanced experiences such as hollow concrete pillars, saving the country more than 370 tons of steel.

### 鹤岗兴安台竖井建成

    鹤岗兴安台竖井建成
    新华社鹤岗6日电　鹤岗煤矿兴安台竖井已经建成，目前正在试生产；不久，这对新型竖井就要正式投入生产了。
    兴安台竖井是苏联帮助我国设计的，它的主要设备也是苏联供给的。因此，它和各地建成的新型竖井一样，是一对高度机械化的竖井。
    兴安台竖井是鹤岗煤矿在东山竖井投入生产后建成的第二对大型竖井。这对竖井的产量比东山竖井大五分之二，土建安装等工程量也增大很多。但是，它的建设时间只用了四年，比东山竖井提前了一年多。
    兴安台竖井的建成，使连建两对竖井的鹤岗建井队伍，迅速地成长壮大起来。他们不但做到速度快，而且取得了好、省的成绩。在兴安台竖井目前进行的试生产中，除了一个小马达发生了一点小事故外，其他设备都在正常地运转。在建井过程中，他们还采用了中空混凝土支柱等先进经验，为国家节省了三百七十多吨钢材。
