Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, July 18th. A Qinling Geological Survey Team composed of six teachers from the Geology Department of Northwest University is currently conducting exploration activities in the Shuangshipu area of the Qinling Mountains.

The Qinling Mountains enter Shaanxi Province from Gansu, pass through the Han and Wei rivers, and connect to the Funiu Mountains in Henan. According to past surveys, this area is known to have deposits of copper, iron, coal, phosphorus, asbestos, lead, and other minerals. The Qinling Geological Survey Team, composed of six teachers from Northwest University, plans to complete a preliminary investigation of the geological conditions in the Qinling area within three to four years. Starting this year, they plan to use their summer vacations each year to conduct activities in the Qinling Mountains, carrying out specialized investigations along three routes traversing the Qinling Mountains from north to south. The scope of research includes the structural forms of various strata in the Qinling Mountains, the geotectonic features of geosynclines, and the geological history development, etc. They strive to complete the preliminary geological research of the Qinling Mountains within the next three to four years, providing a reliable basis for future exploration of mineral resources in the Qinling Mountains.

This survey team is led by Zhang Bosheng, the head of the Geology Department of Northwest University. The Northwest Branch of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the Northwest Geological Bureau, and other units are providing various support and assistance.

    大学教师考查秦岭地质情况
    新华社西安18日电　西北大学地质系的六位教师组成的秦岭地质调查队，现在正在秦岭山区双石铺一带展开考察活动。
    秦岭山脉从甘肃入陕西境，经过汉水、渭水，接河南伏牛山脉。这个地区据过去调查，已知有铜、铁、煤、磷、石棉、铅等矿藏。西北大学六位教师组成的秦岭地质调查队，计划在三、四年内初步完成秦岭地区的地质情况的调查工作。从今年开始，他们准备利用每年暑假到秦岭活动，分三条横贯秦岭南北的路线进行专门调查，研究范围包括秦岭山脉各种岩层的构造形式、地槽的大地构造和地质历史发育等情况。争取在最近三、四年内初步完成秦岭的地质研究工作，为今后勘探秦岭的矿产提供可靠的依据。
    这个调查队由西北大学地质系主任张伯声领导，中国科学院西北分院、西北地质局等单位都给予各种支持和帮助。
