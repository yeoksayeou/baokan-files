Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, July 18th: The First Ministry of Machine Building Industry and the National Committee of the First National Machinery Trade Union of China recently formed a work team to thoroughly inspect the problems existing in the promotion of advanced experiences in machinery factories in the Northeast region, and to help the factories promote advanced experiences in the weak links of production.

　　This work team consists of three working groups: inspection, promotion, and measures. In mid-July, the work team began working at the Shenyang No. 2 Machine Tool Factory. On the 16th, workers and technicians from the promotion group imparted various metal cutting experiences in various workshops. The advanced experience they imparted was aimed at the weak links in production that were identified by the inspection group a few days ago. For example, the drilling workers in the mechanical secondary processing workshop of this factory used manual tapping in the past, and had not completed their tasks for twenty-six months, becoming a weak link in the workshop's production. After Chen Weili, a drilling worker from the Dalian Machine Tool Factory, taught them how to use a drilling machine to replace manual tapping, the processing efficiency increased by more than 30 times. In the afternoon, the measures group also conducted process analysis based on the problems found by the inspection group in inspecting and promoting advanced experiences, and the more than 40 technical suggestions related to the promotion of advanced experiences proposed by the promotion group, according to the technical data collected by various types of work. Aiming at the weak links in production, they helped Shenyang No. 2 Machine Tool Factory formulate a plan for promoting advanced experiences and measures for consolidating advanced experiences.

　　This work team will go to Fushun, Dalian, Harbin, Qiqihar and other places to work in August.

    一个工作队在东北地区
    检查推广先进经验的问题
    据新华社沈阳18日电　第一机械工业部和中国第一机械工会全国委员会，最近组成一个工作队，准备深入检查东北地区机械工厂在推广先进经验中存在的问题，并且帮助各厂在生产薄弱环节上推广先进经验。
    这个工作队组成了检查、推广和措施三个工作组。七月中旬，这支工作队首先在沈阳第二机床厂开始工作。推广组的工人和技术员，十六日在各个车间里传授了各种金属切削经验。他们传授的先进经验，是针对前几天由检查组检查出来的生产薄弱环节进行的。如这个厂机械二加工车间的钻工们，过去用手工绞丝，二十六个月未完成任务，成为这个车间在生产上的薄弱环节。大连机床厂钻工陈维礼向他们传授了用钻床代替手工绞丝的方法以后，加工效率提高了三十多倍。下午，措施组还根据检查组在检查推广先进经验中发现的问题，和推广组提出的四十多项有关推广先进经验的技术建议，按照各工种搜集的技术资料，进行工艺分析，针对生产中的薄弱环节，帮助沈阳第二机床厂制定了推广先进经验的规划和巩固先进经验的措施。
    这个工作队八月间将去抚顺、大连、哈尔滨、齐齐哈尔等地进行工作。
