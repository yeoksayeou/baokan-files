    Drilling Rig That Can Drill 500 Meters Deep
    A drilling machine capable of exploring geological conditions and mineral deposits 500 meters underground has been successfully trial-produced at the Tianjin Joint State-Private Tonghuamao Machinery Factory. Operational testing shows that this drilling machine can rotate 200 times per minute with no noise, and all parts meet design requirements.
    Based on national needs, the Tianjin Second Mechanical Industry Company has decided to expand this small factory, which had been doing odd jobs for seventeen years, into a factory specializing in the manufacture of drilling machines. This year, it will manufacture 110 drilling machines capable of drilling to a depth of 500 meters for the geological, coal, petroleum, and electric power industries. The planned total output value for this year will be more than seven times the highest annual output value before the implementation of joint state-private ownership.

    钻深500公尺的钻机
    可以探知地下500公尺深处的地质和矿藏情况的钻探机，已经在天津市公私合营同华茂机器厂试制成功。运转试验的结果表明，这种钻探机每分钟可以旋转200次，旋转的时候没有一点杂音，各个部分都合乎设计要求。
    天津市第二机械工业公司根据国家需要，确定把这个作了十七年零活的小工厂，扩建成为专门制造钻探机的工厂，今年将为地质、煤炭、石油、电力等工业部门制造110台钻探深度达500公尺的钻探机，今年的计划总产值将比实行公私合营以前的最高年产值多七倍以上。
