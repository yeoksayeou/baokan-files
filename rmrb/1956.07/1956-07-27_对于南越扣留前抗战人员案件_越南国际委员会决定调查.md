    对于南越扣留前抗战人员案件  
    越南国际委员会决定调查
    新华社河内26日电  据越南通讯社报道，越南国际委员会已经决定派一个机动小组，对被南越当局拘禁在承天省内三个集中营的前抗战人员的案件进行调查。
    国际委员会在七月十九日给越南人民军总司令部联络代表团的信中宣布，这次调查将从七月三十一日开始。
    据越南人民军联络代表团在以前给国际委员会的信中所揭发的材料，南越当局在承天省大禄和普泽两地的集中营拘留了约一百二十户家庭，另有七十二户被拘留在承天省汝集的集中营里。
    布置在集中营里外的一批警察特务和间谍密切地监视这些被拘留的人，不许他们同营外的任何人接触。
