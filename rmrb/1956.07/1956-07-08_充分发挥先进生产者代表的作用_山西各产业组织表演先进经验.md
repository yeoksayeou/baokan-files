Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, July 5th: The activities of the textile, coal, machinery and other industrial systems and highway transportation departments in Shanxi Province to exchange advanced experiences have recently concluded one after another.

The Advanced Experience Demonstration Team of the Taiyuan First Machinery Industry System, composed of nine advanced producers and six engineering technicians, gave eight days of demonstrations in nine machinery factories in late June, disseminating thirteen advanced experiences such as the "boring tool" and "tangential cutting tool" to the workers of these factories. Now, a batch of new advanced producers who have increased production efficiency by one to three times have emerged in the machinery industry system.

At the Shanxi Province Cotton Textile Industry Conference for Promoting and Learning from National Textile Advanced Experiences, which concluded at the end of June, representatives attending the National Textile Industry Advanced Producer Representatives Conference demonstrated twenty advanced experiences in eleven types of work, including cotton cleaning and steel wire drawing, which had already been summarized nationwide. More than one hundred and thirty advanced producers in the textile industry system have basically learned these advanced production experiences. Some workers, after learning the "forward-winding package" operation method, have achieved 100% uniformity in the roving sliver.
