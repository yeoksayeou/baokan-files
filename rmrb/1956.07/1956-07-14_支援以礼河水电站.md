    Supporting the Yili River Hydropower Station
    Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, July 12th: Thousands of tons of mechanized construction equipment and various building materials have been continuously transported to the construction site of the Yili River Hydropower Station in northern Yunnan Province. Since the beginning of this year, over a dozen major cities across the country have supplied the construction project of this hydropower station with the necessary machinery and building materials. The various metal cutting machine tools used by the workers here come from Shanghai, Changsha, and Dalian; large quantities of steel are supplied by major factories in Anshan, Fushun, Chongqing, and Wuhan. The power station searchlights used to provide lighting for night shift workers have also been transported from Tianjin.
    The engineering and technical personnel here also come from all directions. The Gutian and Shangyou Hydropower Engineering Bureaus (Offices) recently transferred many senior technical cadres, including the chief engineer; more than 300 various technical workers have been transferred from construction sites such as the Shizitan construction site. In addition, many factories in Kunming have also successively trained a large number of technical workers for this construction project.

    据新华社昆明12日电　成千吨的机械化施工设备和各种建筑器材，已经源源运到云南省北部以礼河水电站建筑工地。今年以来，全国有十几个大城市供应了这个水电站建筑工程需要的机器设备和建筑材料。这里的工人们使用的各种金属切削机床，是来自上海、长沙和大连等地的；大量的钢材，是由鞍山、抚顺、重庆和武汉各大工厂供应的。供给夜班工人施工照明用的电站探照灯也从天津运来了。
    这里的工程技术人员们也是来自四面八方。古田和上犹等水力发电工程局（处），不久以前调来了包括总工程师等许多高级技术干部；从狮子滩建筑工地等地调来的各种技术工人有三百多人。此外，昆明市的许多工厂，也先后为这个建筑工程培养了大批技术工人。
