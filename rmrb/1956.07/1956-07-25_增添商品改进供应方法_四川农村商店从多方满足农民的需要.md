Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, July 21st. More than two thousand rural service stores in Sichuan Province are increasing commodities and improving supply methods to meet the needs of farmers for daily necessities in many ways during the autumn harvest.

    The rural service stores in Sichuan Province are mostly established in agricultural production cooperatives far from market towns and are led by local supply and marketing cooperatives. The commodities they operate generally number around a hundred, including daily necessities such as oil, salt, sundries, stationery, and household medicines. In areas with inconvenient transportation such as Changshou and Fuling, there is already a store in every township. Changshou County is harvesting early rice, and its fifty-eight service stores and three hundred and fifty-eight mobile supply groups have increased commodities based on the consumption habits of farmers during the autumn harvest in previous years. The more than seven hundred farmer households around the Seventh Joint Cooperative of the Shaxi Township Agricultural Cooperative can buy daily necessities nearby because a service store has been established, without having to delay production to travel to distant markets. In order not to delay farmers' production time, the eighteen rural service stores in Shijia District, Neijiang County, deliver goods to the door at noon or after work in the afternoon, taking agricultural production teams as units. At the same time, they also use the favorable conditions of familiar people, places, and customers, and adopt oral appointment and timed supply methods to deliver goods to farmers.

    增添商品改进供应方法
    四川农村商店从多方满足农民的需要
    新华社成都21日电　四川省二千多个农村服务商店，正在增添商品和改进供应方法，从多方面满足农民秋收时对生活用品的需要。
    四川省的农村服务商店大都设立在距离场镇较远的农业生产合作社中，由当地供销合作社领导。经营的商品一般在百种左右，包括油、盐、日用杂货、文具、家用成药等日常必需用品。在交通不便的长寿、涪陵等地，已经乡乡有店。长寿县正在收割早稻，这里的五十八个服务商店和三百五十八个流动供应组，根据农民历年秋收时的消费习惯，增加了商品。沙溪乡农业社第七联社周围七百多户农民，由于设立了服务商店，可以就近买到日常生活用品，不需要耽误生产去远地赶场了。内江县史家区的十八个农村服务商店，为了不耽误农民生产时间，以农业社生产队为单位，在中午或下午生产收工时间送货上门，同时还利用熟人、熟地、熟顾客的有利条件，采取口头预约、定时供应办法，把商品送到农民手里。
