    Construction of Two Modernized Hospitals
    (Our report) On a vacant lot outside Chaoyangmen's Dongdaqiao, a 工-shaped building is under construction. This will be the future Beijing Ninth General Hospital, equipped with modern facilities. The Tenth General Hospital, also with similar facilities, is under construction outside Xuanwumen.
    These two hospitals are both general hospitals, divided into departments such as surgery, internal medicine, obstetrics, otolaryngology, pediatrics, physiotherapy (mainly hydrotherapy and electrotherapy), and traditional Chinese medicine. Each hospital will have 400 beds and can accommodate 800 outpatients daily.
    The equipment in the hospitals will be modernized. The operating rooms will have two power supplies; if one fails during surgery, the other will automatically take over, ensuring the surgery continues as normal. The operating rooms will also be equipped with shadowless lights and oxygen equipment.
    The wards are also designed according to the characteristics of patients. The wards are equipped with floor lights that only illuminate the ground, so that nurses will not wake up patients when they turn on the floor lights for nursing care at night.
    These two hospitals are expected to be completed by the end of this year.
    In addition, Beijing is also building and will build a number of hospitals, clinics, and sanatoriums. They are Nanyuan Hospital, Fengtai Clinic, Dongjiao Clinic, Xidan Clinic, Jingxi Mining Area Hospital, Dongsi Clinic, Heishanhu Sanatorium, and the capital's first obstetrics and gynecology hospital.

    修建两所近代化设备医院
    本报讯　朝阳门外东大桥的一片空地上，正在建筑一座工字形楼房。这就是未来的有着近代化设备的北京市第九综合医院。在宣武门外也在建筑一所具有同样设备的第十综合医院。
    这两所医院都是全科医院，内分外科、内科、产科、五官科、小儿科、理疗科（水疗和电疗为主）、中医科等。每个医院都设有四百个床位，每天还可门诊八百人。
    医院的设备都将是近代化的。手术室中的电源是两路的，动手术中间，一路停电时，另一路可自动接上，保证手术照常进行。手术室内部还装有无影灯，并有氧气设备。
    病房也是根据病人特点而设计的。病房中安有只照亮地面的脚灯，护士夜晚护理病人开脚灯时，不致惊醒病人。
    这两所医院预计今年年底可完工。
    此外，北京市还正在建筑和将要建筑一批医院、门诊部和疗养所。它们是南苑医院、丰台门诊部、东郊门诊部、西单门诊部、京西矿区医院、东四门诊部、黑山扈疗养院以及首都第一个产妇科医院等。（邢克）
