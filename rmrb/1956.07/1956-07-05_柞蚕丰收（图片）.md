Tussah Silkworm Harvest

    The Silk and Cocoon Purchasing Station of Dazhou Prefecture, Sichuan Province, introduced more than 80,000 tussah silkworm seed cocoons from Henan Province this spring, and experimentally released them in ten agricultural producers' cooperatives in Binlang, Shuanglong and other townships in Dazhou County, which is rich in Quercus dentata leaves. The tussah silkworms are growing well, and the cooperatives have now begun harvesting cocoons. It is planned to raise 2 million tussah silkworm seed cocoons here next year.

    The picture shows members of the Fifth Cooperative of Binlang Township picking cocoons.
