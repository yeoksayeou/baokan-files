Xinhua News Agency, July 7th: Two more four-story residential buildings for construction workers broke ground today outside Fuchengmen and Deshengmen in Beijing.

In the past seven months or so, more than 1,500 construction workers and staff members in Beijing have moved into new homes. Oil painter Zhao Zizhen, who previously lived with three generations in two small rooms, has now moved into five spacious rooms with a kitchen and sanitary facilities.

Recently, many construction units in the central government and Beijing have submitted applications to the Beijing Municipal Urban Planning Bureau for the construction of residential buildings for construction workers. According to incomplete statistics from the Beijing Municipal Construction Engineering Bureau, this year it is planned to build 1,800 residential units, a chronic disease hospital, and a kindergarten for construction workers.

In recent years, Beijing has built 121 sanatoriums, amateur recreation centers, clubs, family guesthouses, nurseries, and bathhouses and other cultural and welfare facilities for construction workers. Many construction worker residential areas also have welfare facilities. For example, the Jiuxianqiao construction worker residential area has a library, a floodlit ball field, and a small garden. Seven residential areas for construction workers' families, such as Xizhaosi and Xiaonanzhuang, have formulated plans to build nurseries, health stations, cultural stations, and clubs.

    为建筑工人盖新房
    新华社7日讯　在北京阜成门外和德胜门外，今天又有两幢四层楼的建筑工人住宅破土兴建。
    到今天为止的七个多月中，北京市已经有一千五百多户建筑工人和职员，陆续迁进了新居。油画工赵子珍以前三代同住两间小屋，这次迁进了五间宽敞的房间，里面还有厨房和卫生设备。
    最近几天，中央和北京的许多建筑单位，都向北京市城市规划管理局提出了兴建建筑工人住宅的申请。据北京市建筑工程局不完全统计，今年计划为建筑工人兴建一千八百户住宅、一座慢性病院和一座幼儿园。
    几年来，北京市已经为建筑工人兴建了121座疗养院、业余休养所、俱乐部、家属招待所、托儿所和浴室等文化福利设施。许多建筑工人住宅区也设有福利设施。如九仙桥的建筑工人住宅区里设有图书馆、灯光球场和小花园。夕照寺、小南庄等七个建筑工人家属居住区，已经制定了兴建托儿站、保健站、文化站和俱乐部的计划。
