    Don't Let Cooperative Members Be "Left Disappointed"
    Yi Ding
    Regarding the amount of public accumulation to be deducted during this year's summer income distribution, different opinions arose between some agricultural production cooperative cadres and members in Henan Province.

    Cooperative cadres believed that the cooperative's public accumulation was still small, and there were many difficulties in developing production, so they advocated deducting more and distributing less. For example, Hou Erzhong, deputy director of the Sima Agricultural Production Cooperative in Xingyang County, said, "We can't deduct less just because we've increased production! The difficulties we faced this spring were really unbearable!" Some cooperative cadres in Anyang Prefecture said, "Keeping it within the cooperative is easier than asking for it from the members again." Some cooperatives had particularly large deduction ratios. For example, the deduction ratio of the Niuwa Cooperative in Wen County reached 48.3%, and the deduction ratio of the Lixia Cooperative in Jiyuan County even reached 54%.

    The members generally advocated deducting less and distributing more. They worried about cadres being extravagant and wasteful, and worried that increased production would not lead to increased income. They said: What we fear most is deducting too much and not getting enough grain, leaving us with nothing but disappointment.

    Sufficient attention should be paid to the opinions of the members. After the task of increasing production is resolved, the correctness of the deduction ratio will have a decisive impact on ensuring that more than 90% of the members increase their income. If it cannot be guaranteed that the vast majority of members increase their income, the members' enthusiasm for labor will be affected. Before the Hongguang Agricultural Production Cooperative in Lushan County formulated its preliminary distribution plan, some cooperative cadres wanted to deduct more wheat; the members heard the rumors and were generally afraid of reduced income, so their production enthusiasm was not high, and the attendance rate was only about 30%. Later, the cooperative implemented the policy of deducting less and distributing more in the formulation of the preliminary distribution plan, so that more than 90% of the members increased their income compared to last year. The members' enthusiasm for labor quickly increased, and the attendance rate rose to 95%.

    In order to implement the principle of deducting less and distributing more, the Henan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China stipulated in its summer preliminary distribution instructions: The various deductions of the cooperative (including agricultural tax) should generally not exceed 35% of the total income from agriculture and sideline occupations, and the distribution to members should generally not be lower than 65%; reserve grain should generally not be retained in the summer; due national loans should be repaid as much as possible. If repayment affects the increase in income for more than 90% of the members, less can be repaid, or repayment can be postponed until after the autumn harvest; members' production investment exceeding the share of the shareholding fund should be appropriately returned, and interest on the investment must be paid on time. This regulation of the Henan Provincial Committee correctly reflects the interests of the state, the cooperative, and the members. According to a typical survey of five cooperatives in Xuchang Prefecture, the deduction ratio only accounted for 33.13% of the total income as a result of the summer distribution conducted in accordance with this regulation, enabling 91.41% of the members to increase their income compared to last year, while also fulfilling the obligations to the state and ensuring the needs of further development of production within the cooperative.

    When implementing the policy of deducting less and distributing more, a very important task is to be meticulous in calculation and economize on unnecessary expenses. When the Qingnian Agricultural Production Cooperative in Anyang County formulated its preliminary distribution plan, it conducted a survey of the members' investment situation last year and the cooperative's economic potential, and made accurate calculations of various expenses, so that the deduction ratio was reduced from 51.52% to 35%, and the number of households with increased income rose from 66% to 94%. Facts have proven that as long as the work of increasing production avenues and economizing on unnecessary expenses are done simultaneously, it is entirely possible to guarantee that more than 90% of the members increase their income.

    不要让社员“落个空欢喜”

    今年夏季收益分配中公共积累应该扣除多少，河南省许多农业生产合作社的社干部和社员之间曾经发生了不同的意见。
    社干部认为合作社的公共积累还很少，发展生产的困难多，主张多扣少分。如荥阳县司马农业生产合作社副主任侯二中说：“增了产可不能少扣，今年春天的困难真叫人受够了！”安阳专区有的社干部说：“扣留在社内，总比再从社员的手里要来得容易。”有些社的扣除比例特别大。如温县牛洼社的扣除比例占到总收入的48.3％，济源县黎霞社的扣除比例甚至占到总收入的54％。
    社员们普遍主张少扣多分。他们担心干部铺张浪费，担心增加了生产不能增加收入。他们说：最怕的就是扣留太多，分不到粮食，落个空欢喜。
    对于社员们的意见应当充分地注意。当增加生产的任务解决以后，扣除比例的正确与否，对争取做到90％以上的社员增加收入有着决定性的作用。如果不能保证绝大部分社员增加收入，社员的劳动积极性就会受到影响。鲁山县红光农业生产合作社在制定预分方案以前，有的社干部想多扣下些麦子；社员们听到了风声，普遍怕减少收入，生产情绪不高，出勤率只到30％左右。后来，社里在制定预分方案中贯彻执行了少扣多分的政策，使90％以上的社员都比去年增加收入，社员们的劳动热情迅速地高涨起来，出勤率上升到95％。
    为了贯彻执行少扣多分的原则，中共河南省委在夏季预分指示中规定：合作社的各项扣除（包括农业税在内），一般不应超过农副业总收入的35％，分配给社员的一般不应低于65％；储备粮夏季一般不留；到期的国家贷款，能够归还的应尽可能归还，如因归还后影响90％以上社员增加收入，可以少归还一些，或缓到秋后归还；社员的生产投资超过应摊股份基金部分，必须酌情归还一部分，投资的利息必须按期付清。河南省委这个规定，正确地体现了国家、合作社和社员三方面的利益。据许昌专区五个合作社的典型调查，按照这个规定进行了夏季分配的结果，扣除比例只占到总收入的33.13％，使91.41％的社员都比去年增加了收入，同时也履行了对国家应尽的义务，保证了社内进一步发展生产的需要。
    在贯彻执行少扣多分的政策的时候，一个很重要的工作，就是精打细算，节约不必要的开支。安阳县青年农业生产合作社在制订预分方案的时候，由于对社员去年的投资情况和社内经济潜力进行了调查，对各项开支进行了精确的核算，使扣除比例由51.52％降低到35％，社员增加收入的户数由66％上升到94％。事实证明，只要把增加生产门路和节约不必要的开支两方面的工作同时做好，保证90％以上社员增加收入是完全可以做得到的。
