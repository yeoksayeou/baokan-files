How Anhui Daily Promotes Agricultural Production Reform
Liao Qi
    As we all know, in the past three years, Anhui Province has achieved great success in implementing three agricultural production reforms (referred to as the "Three Reforms"). What work has Anhui Daily done in this major reform of local agricultural production, and what are some of the main experiences?
    The "Three Reforms" are methods proposed by the Anhui Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China based on the specific conditions of Anhui to ensure increased agricultural production. Nevertheless, promoting the "Three Reforms" was not an easy task. Especially in the beginning, the masses did not understand the specific content of the "Three Reforms" and did not realize the benefits of the "Three Reforms" from personal experience, so there were inevitably more difficulties. Just as it is necessary to make good use of typical demonstration methods in practical work, it is also necessary to make good use of this method in newspaper propaganda. Anhui Daily's propaganda on the "Three Reforms" focused on using practical examples and advanced models among the masses to educate the masses, help the masses build confidence in realizing the "Three Reforms," and encourage the masses to move forward. Opening Anhui Daily, there are many such examples. For example, the newspaper on January 16, 1954, focused on reporting the experiences of Su County farmer Lü Yunxian, who had achieved bumper harvests of potatoes for more than ten years, and Fuyang County farmer Yan Xifeng's successful trial planting of potatoes. These vivid facts illustrate the necessity and possibility of changing to early-maturing crops such as potatoes. Anhui Daily also often organizes special pages to vigorously promote the achievements of the "Three Reforms" through text and pictures, various creations among the masses, and the personal experiences of advanced figures in promoting the "Three Reforms." With the promotion of the "Three Reforms," various problems have emerged in practical work. For example, expanding the planting area of ​​summer crops has to a certain extent brought about the difficulty of insufficient spring land; how to arrange crop stubble for changing to double-cropping rice and promoting a three-crop-a-year system are all new problems. Anhui Daily pays close attention to these problems; in order to solve these problems, it similarly adopted the approach of vigorously publicizing the creations, innovations, and advanced experiences among the masses. The newspaper successively published the experience of labor model Zhang Huiting in planting four crops and harvesting three crops a year (one season of green manure), the experience of seedling storage in the Jiangnan area, and the advanced experience of rational close planting and rational fertilization, which played a good role in solving these problems and promoting the masses to further implement the "Three Reforms."
    A new thing must go through a struggle to grow in life. The promotion of the "Three Reforms" in Anhui Province is no exception. Although the "Three Reforms" were actively supported and endorsed by the broad masses, some people, confined to habitual forces and conservative ideas, held skeptical, mocking, and critical attitudes towards the "Three Reforms." In order to eliminate ideological obstacles in promoting the "Three Reforms," Anhui Daily waged an irreconcilable struggle against right-leaning conservative thought. The newspaper once published two essays by Comrade Zeng Xisheng, Secretary of the Anhui Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, which powerfully criticized right-leaning conservative thought from a theoretical and practical perspective. The editorial department also strived to strengthen the newspaper's commentary work, successively publishing sixty-seven commentaries, and also organized dozens of responsible comrades from the prefectural and county party committees to write special articles, starting from the local natural conditions, mass experience, and increased production requirements, analyzing the possibility and necessity of promoting the "Three Reforms," and refuting various excuses of representatives of right-leaning conservative thought. In addition to launching struggles against right-leaning conservative thought through commentaries, Anhui Daily paid more attention to using advanced models to educate those with conservative ideas. For example, in terms of planting double-cropping rice, Anhui Daily prominently introduced the news of the successful trial planting of double-cropping rice at the Xujiagang Rice Experiment Station in Huaibei, proving that double-cropping rice can not only cross the Yangtze River but also the Huai River, thereby criticizing the argument that "double-cropping rice cannot cross the Yangtze River." Such reports appear frequently in the newspaper.
    In the process of promoting the "Three Reforms," Anhui Daily paid great attention to the principle of adapting to local conditions. The newspaper raised this issue in the first editorial promoting the "Three Reforms"; later, it successively published editorials such as "Promote the Style of In-depth Research, Find Key to Increased Production According to Regional Characteristics," "Promote 'Three Reforms' Must Actively Lead and Adapt to Local Conditions," and "Further Discussion on Promoting 'Three Reforms' Must Actively Lead and Adapt to Local Conditions." In these editorials, the newspaper analyzed the importance of adapting to local conditions in promoting agricultural production reform with concrete facts, repeatedly emphasized that promoting the "Three Reforms" is a difficult and meticulous task of changing customs, and must not be copied mechanically, but must proceed from the actual situation of the local area, conduct in-depth investigation and research, and consult with the masses more in order to do the work well. The newspaper also sharply criticized the practice of some cadres blindly deploying the task of planting double-cropping rice regardless of the local water conservancy conditions. At the same time, it introduced some good examples of adapting to local conditions in promoting the "Three Reforms," such as "Preliminary Summary on the Promotion of Double-Cropping Early Rice" (Anqing area), "Research on Agricultural Production Increase and Income Protection Issues in Dingyuan County," "Ways to Increase Grain Production in the Mountainous Areas of Yuexi County," and so on. These articles introduced methods of increasing production by adapting to local conditions, inspiring leading workers in various places to further study local production conditions and how to promote the "Three Reforms" by adapting to local conditions.
    In the "Three Reforms" propaganda, Anhui Daily also emphasized the guaranteeing role of strengthening the Party's leadership in promoting the "Three Reforms." The "Three Reforms" is a new and important work related to the production and life of the broad masses of farmers, and it is impossible to do well without the strong leadership of party organizations at all levels. Anhui Daily promoted the excellent leadership style of going deep into reality, conducting investigations and research, conscientiously cultivating typical examples, and summarizing and promoting the experience of the "Three Reforms," criticized the phenomenon of some party organizations neglecting the leadership of the "Three Reforms," and pointed out that due to the "Three Reforms," new changes have taken place in production materials (such as seeds, fertilizers, etc.) and technical personnel, and party organizations at all levels must have an overall plan. In the reform of cultivation systems and cultivation techniques, strengthening technical guidance is very important. Anhui Daily also attaches great importance to the publicity of agricultural technology. The newspaper opened a "Agricultural Technology" column, which systematically explained some cultivation technical problems that must be solved in promoting the "Three Reforms," and introduced the eating, storage methods, and pest and disease control methods of certain high-yield crops.
    Now, in the agricultural production increase movement, many regions regard reforming the cultivation system and cultivation methods as important measures to increase production. Some of the good experiences of Anhui Daily in publicizing the three agricultural production reforms over the past three years are worthy of reference by newspapers in various regions.

    安徽日报是怎样宣传农业生产改革的
    廖奇
    大家知道，近三年来，安徽省推行农业生产的三项改革（简称“三改”），已经取得了很大的成就。安徽日报在当地农业生产的这一重大改革中作了哪些工作，有些什么主要的经验呢？
      “三改”是中共安徽省委根据安徽具体情况提出来的保证农业增产的办法。尽管如此，推行“三改”却不是一件轻而易举的事。特别是开始的时候，群众还不了解“三改”办法的具体内容，没有从亲身的体验中认识到“三改”的好处，困难不免更多一些。正如在实际工作中需要很好地运用典型示范的方法一样，在报纸的宣传中也需要很好地运用这个方法。安徽日报宣传“三改”，就是着重用实际事例和群众中先进的榜样来教育群众，帮助群众树立实现“三改”的信心，鼓舞群众前进。翻开安徽日报一看，这样的例子是很多的。像1954年1月16日的报纸，就集中地报道了宿县农民吕运先十几年来种马铃薯都获得丰收、阜阳县农民阎西峰试种马铃薯成功的经验等等，这些活生生的事实说明了改种早熟作物马铃薯的必要和可能。安徽日报还常常组织专页，通过文字和图片有力地宣传“三改”的成就，群众中的各种创造，以及先进人物在推行“三改”中的亲身体会。随着“三改”办法的推广，在实际工作中出现了各种问题。例如，扩大午季作物种植面积，就在一定程度上带来了春地不足的困难；改种双季稻、推行一年三熟制，如何安排作物茬口，这些都是新问题。安徽日报密切地注意到这些问题；为了解决这些问题，同样地采用了大力宣传群众中的创造、革新和先进经验的做法。报纸先后发表的劳动模范张会庭一年四种三收（一季绿肥）的经验，江南地区的窖秧经验，合理密植和合理施肥的先进经验，对解决这些问题，推动群众进一步贯彻执行“三改”办法，起了良好的作用。
    一件新的事物要在生活中成长起来，都是要经过一番斗争的。安徽省推行“三改”也不例外。“三改”办法虽然得到广大群众的积极支持和拥护，但也有一些人囿于习惯势力和保守思想，对“三改”抱着怀疑、讥笑和非难的态度。为了清除推行“三改”中的思想障碍，安徽日报向右倾保守思想作了不调和的斗争。报纸曾经发表中共安徽省委书记曾希圣同志关于“三改”的两篇论文，从理论上和实践上有力地批判了右倾保守思想。编辑部也努力加强了报纸的言论工作，先后发表了六十七篇评论，还组织几十位地委和县委负责同志写了专文，从当地的自然条件、群众经验、增产要求等方面出发，分析了推行“三改”的可能性和必要性，批驳了右倾保守思想的代表者的各种借口。除了通过评论向右倾保守思想展开斗争以外，安徽日报更注意运用先进的榜样来教育那些有保守思想的人。例如，在种双季稻方面，安徽日报突出地介绍了淮北徐家港稻作试验场试种双季稻成功的消息，证明双季稻不仅可以过长江，而且可以过淮河，从而批判了那种“双季稻不能过长江”的论调。这样的报道，在报纸上是出现得很多的。
    安徽日报在宣传“三改”过程中，十分注意因地制宜的原则。报纸在宣传“三改”的第一篇社论中，就提出了这个问题；以后又陆续发表了“发扬深入研究作风，根据地区特点，寻找增产关键”、“推行‘三改’必须积极领导因地制宜”和“再论推行‘三改’必须积极领导因地制宜”的社论。在这些社论里，报纸用具体的事实分析了推行农业生产改革必须因地制宜的重要性，一再强调说明推行“三改”是一件移风易俗艰苦细致的工作，决不能照搬硬套，必须从当地实际情况出发，进行深入的调查研究，多同群众商量，才能把工作做好。报纸还尖锐地批判了有些干部不问当地水利条件如何，就盲目部署种植双季稻的任务的做法。同时，介绍了一些推行“三改”做到了因地制宜的好例子，如“关于推广双季早稻工作初步总结”（安庆地区）、“关于定远县农业增产保收问题的研究”、“在岳西县山区增产粮食的途径”等等。这些文章都介绍了因地制宜的增产办法，启发了各地领导工作人员更深入地去研究当地生产条件，研究如何因地制宜地推行“三改”。
    在“三改”宣传中，安徽日报也强调了加强党的领导对推行“三改”的保证作用。“三改”是关系广大农民生产和生活的一项新的重要的工作，没有各级党组织的坚强领导，是不可能做好的。安徽日报宣扬了那种深入实际、调查研究、认真培养典型、总结推广“三改”经验的优良领导作风，批判了某些党组织忽视对“三改”领导的现象，提出了由于推行“三改”所带来的在生产资料（如种子、肥料等）和技术人材等方面的新变化，各级党组织必须有通盘的规划。在耕作制度、耕作技术的改革中，加强技术指导是很重要的。安徽日报也很重视农业技术的宣传。报上辟了“农业技术”专栏，比较系统地说明了推行“三改”中必须解决的一些耕作技术问题，并且介绍了某些高产作物的食用、贮藏方法和病虫害的防治办法。
    现在许多地区在农业增产运动中，都把改革耕作制度和耕作方法当作重要的增产措施。安徽日报三年来宣传农业生产三项改革的一些好经验，是值得各地报纸参考的。
