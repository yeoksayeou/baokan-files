    Following the adjustment of the commercial network, business at Ruifuxiang thrives
    (Our newspaper dispatch) After the adjustment of the commercial network, business at the most famous silk and fabric store in Beijing – the joint state-private “Ruifuxiang” Fabric Store – has become even more prosperous. In order to implement the correct measures for adjusting the commercial network, the state-owned commercial leadership department, on June 1st, revoked the cotton cloth department of the Beijing Department Store’s Second Branch, in order to increase Ruifuxiang’s turnover and overcome the phenomenon of “public business busy, private business idle.” In the month since the commercial network was adjusted, Ruifuxiang’s average daily business has increased by more than 1,000 yuan compared to the past. In the first half of this year, the sales plan was not completed for four months, but the sales plan for June was overfulfilled. The employees are also busier. (Yu)

    商业网调整之后瑞蚨祥生意兴隆
    本报讯　北京最有名的绸缎布店——公私合营“瑞蚨祥”布店，在调整商业网之后，生意更加繁荣。国营商业领导部门，为了贯彻执行调整商业网的正确措施，于六月一日将北京市百货公司第二门市部的棉布部撤销，以便增加“瑞蚨祥”的营业额，克服“公忙私闲”的现象。经过调整商业网后的一个月来，瑞蚨祥平均每日比过去多做了一千多元的生意。今年上半年，有四个月的销售计划都没有完成，六月份的销售计划竟超额完成了。职工们也忙起来了。　（瑜）
