    The Development of Friendly Relations Between the Soviet Union and Arab Countries
    Soviet Foreign Minister Shepilov recently visited Egypt, Syria, and Lebanon, and held talks with the government leaders of these countries on important international issues. The communiqués issued after the talks all pointed out that they had completely identical views on the various issues discussed. The communiqués described the desire of the Soviet Union, Egypt, Syria, and Lebanon to continue cooperation in order to consolidate world peace, and expressed the common desire to further strengthen economic and cultural exchanges. Arab public opinion called the Soviet Foreign Minister "an envoy of friendly countries" because his visit promoted mutual understanding, trust, and friendship between the Soviet Union and Arab countries.

    The continuous development of friendly relations between the Soviet Union and Arab countries has profound reasons. The Soviet-Egyptian, Soviet-Syrian, and Soviet-Lebanese joint communiqués all stated their friendly relationship is based on the principles of the United Nations Charter and the famous principles of the Bandung Conference. Although The USSR did not attend the Bandung Conference, it has always warmly welcomed and supported the resolutions of this conference because these resolutions also conform to the basic principles of Soviet foreign policy.

    Since its founding, the Soviet Union has consistently respected the national sovereignty and independence of oppressed Eastern countries and supported the struggles of Eastern countries for independence and freedom. The Soviet Union is the natural friend of all oppressed nations. In the Middle East, just as in other regions, the Soviet Union has never pursued any privileges, special interests, or spheres of influence. The Soviet Union is concerned with ensuring the independence and autonomy of all countries in this region, establishing good-neighborly relations with them, and maintaining peace and security in this region. In recent years, as Arab countries, led by Egypt, have embarked on the path of national rejuvenation and adhered to an independent and autonomous policy, the friendly relations between the Soviet Union and Arab countries have developed under new conditions. Mutual visits between them have increased, and their economic and cultural cooperation has been strengthened. The broad masses of Arab people deeply cherish this sincere friendship. Egyptian Prime Minister Nasser has said more than once that Egypt is willing to be friendly with whoever is willing to be friendly with the Egyptian people. Syrian President Kuwatli also said at a banquet in honor of Shepilov that Syria responds with gratitude to sincere relations, and it extends a friendly hand to everyone who responds to it in the same manner. It is entirely understandable that Arab countries, which have long suffered from imperialist oppression and continue to be threatened by imperialism, have found sincere friendship in the Soviet Union.

    The Soviet Union, like the Arab countries, is very concerned about its economic cooperation with the Arab countries. During his visits to Egypt, Syria, and Lebanon, Shepilov reiterated the Soviet Union's willingness to support these countries in developing their national economies. The Soviet Union's economic and technical assistance to other countries does not come with any conditions attached. For example, the recent agreement by the Soviet Union to help Egypt establish a nuclear physics laboratory is an example. Therefore, strengthening economic cooperation with the Soviet Union and obtaining economic and technical assistance from the Soviet Union is entirely in line with the national interests of the Arab countries.

    The friendly cooperation between the Soviet Union and the Arab countries not only does not exclude their friendly relations with any other country but will also promote broader friendly cooperation between countries around the world. However, strangely enough, the United States has become uneasy. American propaganda organs have recently said that because Egypt has established friendly relations with the Soviet Union, US-Egyptian relations seem to have "ended." In the ruling circles of the United States, some people have even openly advocated a "tough" policy toward Egypt. It seems that the United States is really suffering from "monopoly disease," and it wants to monopolize everything. According to its thinking, it seems that a certain country only has the obligation to interact with the United States and does not have the right to interact with other countries. However, the Arab countries are no longer pawns on the chessboard of imperialist power politics, and who else is willing to abide by this rule set by the United States?

    No force in the world can stop the Arab countries from establishing sincere friendships with all countries, and no force can stop them from advancing on the road of independent development. As Shepilov said during his visit to Egypt, "Under the new conditions of the great development of independent Eastern countries at present, and under the conditions where there are many friendly, powerful, peace-loving countries in the West and the East that advocate sincere cooperation between all peoples, you have good fellow travelers and good neighbors. Under these conditions, no difficulties and dangers are enough to resist your lofty movement of patriotism." We wish the friendly relations between the Arab countries and all countries of the world will continue to develop, and we wish the national rejuvenation cause of the Arab countries will continue to achieve victory.

### 苏联同阿拉伯国家友好关系的发展

    苏联同阿拉伯国家友好关系的发展
    苏联外交部长谢皮洛夫最近访问了埃及、叙利亚和黎巴嫩，并同这些国家的政府领袖就重要的国际问题分别地举行了会谈。在会谈以后发表的各项公报都指出，它们对所讨论的各种问题的观点完全一致。公报叙述了苏联同埃及、叙利亚和黎巴嫩为了巩固世界和平而继续合作的愿望，并表达了进一步加强经济文化交流的共同要求。阿拉伯国家舆论把苏联外交部长称为“友好国家的使者”，因为他的访问促进了苏联同阿拉伯国家之间的互相了解、信任和友谊。
    苏联同阿拉伯国家友好关系的不断发展，是有深刻的原因的。苏埃、苏叙和苏黎会谈公报一致声明，他们的友好关系是以联合国宪章的原则和万隆会议的著名原则为基础的。苏联虽然没有参加万隆会议，但是它一直热烈欢迎和支持这个会议的决议，因为这些决议也符合于苏联外交政策的基本原则。
    苏联自从成立的一天起，就始终不渝地尊重被压迫的东方国家的民族主权和独立，支持东方国家争取独立自由的斗争。苏联是一切被压迫民族的天然的朋友。在中近东，正同在其他地区一样，苏联从来不追求任何特权、特殊利益和势力范围，苏联所关心的是保障这个地区所有国家的独立自主，同它们建立睦邻关系，并维护这个地区的和平和安全。近几年来，由于以埃及为首的阿拉伯国家走上民族复兴的道路，并坚持实行独立自主的政策，苏联同阿拉伯国家的友好关系更在新的条件下发展起来了。他们之间互相访问日益增多，他们之间的经济文化合作日益加强。广大的阿拉伯人民都十分珍视真诚的友谊。埃及总理纳赛尔不止一次地说过，谁愿意同埃及人民友好，埃及人民也就愿意同谁友好。叙利亚总统库阿特利在接待谢皮洛夫的宴会上也说，叙利亚以感谢的心情来回答真挚的关系，它向每一个用同样态度来回答它的人伸出友好的手。长期遭受帝国主义压迫并且至今仍然不断遭受帝国主义威胁的阿拉伯国家，在苏联那里找到了真诚的友谊，这是完全可以理解的。
    苏联和阿拉伯国家一样，十分关心它和阿拉伯国家的经济合作。谢皮洛夫在访问埃及、叙利亚和黎巴嫩期间，再次表示了苏联支持这些国家发展民族经济的愿望。苏联对其他国家的经济和技术援助，是不附带任何条件的。例如，不久以前，苏联同意帮助埃及建立核子物理实验所，就是一个例子。因此，加强同苏联的经济合作，取得苏联的经济和技术援助，是完全符合阿拉伯国家的民族利益的。
    苏联同阿拉伯国家的友好合作，这不但并不排斥它们同其他任何国家的友好关系，而且会促进世界各国之间更广泛的友好合作。但是，奇怪的是美国却不安起来了。美国宣传机关最近说，由于埃及同苏联建立了友好关系，美埃关系似乎是“结束”了。在美国统治集团中，有人竟公开主张对埃及实行“强硬”政策。看来，美国真是害了“垄断病”，它什么都想垄断。照它的想法，好像某一个国家只有义务同美国来往，而没有权利同其他国家来往。可是，阿拉伯国家早就不是帝国主义强权政治的棋盘上的卒子了，现在还有谁愿意遵守这种美国定下的清规戒律呢？
    世界上没有任何力量能够阻挡阿拉伯国家同各国建立真诚的友谊，也没有任何力量能够阻挡它们在独立发展的道路上前进。正像谢皮洛夫访问埃及时所说的，“在目前东方独立国家大大发展的新条件下，在西方以及东方存在着许多同阿拉伯人友好的、强大的、主张和平和各国人民之间真诚合作的国家的条件下，你们有好旅伴，也有好邻居。在这些条件下，再也没有任何困难和危险足以抗拒你们爱国主义的崇高运动。”我们祝阿拉伯国家同世界各国的友好关系得到不断发展，我们祝阿拉伯国家的民族复兴事业得到不断胜利。
