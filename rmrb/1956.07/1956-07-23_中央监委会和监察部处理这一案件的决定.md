Xinhua News Agency, July 21st: Decision of the Central Supervisory Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Ministry of Supervision of the People's Republic of China regarding the handling of the case of disunity among leading cadres, damage to machinery, and endangerment of production at the state-owned Shenyang Transformer Factory. The full text is as follows:

The state-owned Shenyang Transformer Factory has had many serious problems in its work over the past few years, such as damage to machinery, substandard product quality, fraudulent practices, failure to earnestly learn from advanced Soviet experience, and disunity among leading cadres, which have caused serious losses to the state. After a joint inspection by the central and local Party supervisory organs and state supervisory organs, the main erroneous facts were found to be as follows:

I. Massive damage and waste of state property, and damage to machinery and equipment. According to statistics from January 1954 to the first quarter of 1955, production losses, waste, and stockpiling amounted to more than 12.7 million yuan, of which losses and waste amounted to 2.2 million yuan; in terms of capital construction, losses, waste, and stockpiling from 1952 to 1954 amounted to 5.17 million yuan, of which losses and waste amounted to 1.76 million yuan. The total losses, waste, and stockpiling in production and capital construction amounted to 17.87 million yuan, including thirty-six product quality accidents, with a total loss of 740,000 yuan. The damage to machinery and equipment reached an alarming degree. Of the 348 various machine tools in the factory, 90% had suffered damage to varying degrees. A large number of machine parts were lost. For example, of the 123 imported precision new machine tools, 44 had lost key components. When difficulties arose in using new machines, the factory's leading cadres did not organize workers to study the operation properly, but instead dismantled and modified the machines haphazardly. Thirty-five imported new machines were dismantled and modified successively, of which sixteen had their automated devices converted to manual operation or used manual operation because of the loss of components. At the same time, 43 original machine tools were left idle, resulting in the loss of most of their parts. The factory also had a complete set of three-ton electric iron furnace, which other factories requested to use, but they refused to allocate it, preferring to dismantle it (with the approval of the factory director) and scrap it for iron. Workers raised objections to these erroneous actions, but the leadership refused to adopt them. In addition, since 1954, there have been eleven accidents involving dangerous objects such as scissors, gloves, and iron wires being found in transformers leaving the factory.

II. Unilaterally pursuing output, neglecting product quality, passing off substandard products as qualified products, and deceiving the state and fraternal factories and mines. According to statistics for 1953 and 1954, a total of 1,338 unqualified large and small transformers and 3,116 unqualified voltage and current transformers were produced. Of the more than 1,200 small transformers currently in stock, more than 670 are leaking or seeping oil, and these finished products must be reworked. Products that have already left the factory are often returned by the thousands, or personnel must be sent to rework them. In 1954, the cost of rework trips to various locations reached more than 220,000 yuan. Eighty-nine fraternal factories and mines suffered losses in 1954 alone, including six factories and mines belonging to key projects within the 156 items, and thirteen factories and mines belonging to above-quota projects. More seriously, in February 1954, transformers known to be unqualified were sent to the Leipzig Trade Fair in Germany. Oil leaks occurred during the exhibition, and the oil had to be poured out, causing extremely bad international repercussions for the country.

III. Failing to faithfully implement state plans, engaging in fraudulent practices, and obtaining honors and bonuses through deception. The Transformer Factory adopted a series of actions to deceive the Party and the state, and obtained the honor of "First-Class Factory" in the national electrical engineering system and a large amount of enterprise bonuses. For example, it falsely reported that it had overfulfilled the 1954 cost plan and profit plan, when in fact it had not even completed the original plan. It intentionally lowered the quality of products and tried to cover up the unqualified products to get them “through the gate.” It falsely reported that 98.81% of the capital construction tasks were completed in 1954, when in fact only 58.47% were completed. The Transformer Factory has introduced 43 articles of experience since 1953, of which 16 contained falsehoods. Employees sarcastically said: "The Transformer Factory is a mother machine for manufacturing work experience."

IV. Failing to earnestly learn from advanced Soviet experience, refusing to implement correct suggestions from Soviet experts, and arbitrarily deleting and modifying Soviet technical data. They assigned the important political task of learning from advanced Soviet experience and correctly implementing the suggestions of Soviet experts to Chief Engineer Tang Mingqi, and a small number of technicians led by Tang took a rejecting attitude towards learning from the Soviet Union. Soviet experts repeatedly made suggestions regarding the factory's low product quality, but they mostly refused to implement them. From 1951 to the first quarter of 1955, Soviet experts made a total of 374 suggestions, of which only 31% were implemented or implemented relatively well, and most were not implemented or were implemented incompletely. At the same time, they also arbitrarily modified a large number of drawings and data, modifying 28 of the 31 Soviet data adopted, and producing a large quantity according to the modified drawings, resulting in serious losses.

V. The factory leadership has serious right-leaning paralysis thinking, emphasizing talent and neglecting morality in the selection of cadres and the development of Party members, lowering the conditions for Party membership, violating Party principles, and causing serious impurity in the factory's administrative and Party organizations.

The reason for the above errors is mainly that the Party and administrative leaders of the factory have been in disunity for a long time, abandoning the leadership and supervision of production. Party Secretary Lang Zongying is arrogant and complacent, believing that he came to the factory earliest, calling himself the factory's "local tyrant," and competing with the factory director for power. Factory Director Ren Junjie believes that he is an old Party member, unilaterally emphasizing the "one-chief system," disrespecting the leadership of the Party, and refusing Party criticism and supervision. They schemed against each other, excluded each other, and engaged in factionalism. The serious disunity between the factory's Party secretary and the factory director directly affected the disunity of the Party's grassroots organizations and administrative department and workshop cadres, thus causing serious losses to production.

Based on the above circumstances, the following decisions have been made regarding the relevant personnel:

I. Party Secretary Lang Zongying, joined the Party in 1945. After coming to the factory in 1950, he has consistently been in disunity with the former factory director, the chairman of the trade union, and the current factory director, and has abandoned supervision of production. He usually bullies those above and suppresses those below, and implements a patriarchal leadership style. This time, he showed schadenfreude towards the inspection work and intentionally exaggerated the factory director's mistakes. It is decided to give him the punishment of removal from the position of Party Secretary.

II. Factory Director Ren Junjie (Party Committee Member), joined the Party in 1937. After coming to the factory in 1952, he unilaterally emphasized the "one-chief system" in his work, disrespecting the leadership of the Party, refusing Party supervision, and being in disunity with Lang Zongying for a long time. He abandoned the leadership of production. He bears direct leadership responsibility for the errors of low product quality, many accidents, and damage to machinery and equipment. It is decided to give him the punishment of removal from work within the Party and demotion administratively.

III. Yue Zhenshan, Director of the Organization Department of the Party Committee and Deputy Secretary of the Discipline Inspection Commission, joined the Party in 1950 and served as Deputy Secretary of the General Branch of the Youth League in the factory. In his work, he has consistently suppressed criticism, sowed discord among cadres, undermined unity, shielded Zhao Hong (relative), a counter-revolutionary element with blood debts, and Tian Fachun (father-in-law), a bad element, knowing that his wife fabricated history. He did not pay Youth League dues, and instead of reporting to the organization, he asked the head of the cadre department to solve the problem of her joining the Party, which is of extremely bad character. It is decided to expel him from the Party.

IV. Zhang Shangyi, First Deputy Factory Director (Party Committee Member), joined the Party in 1948 and was promoted to Deputy Factory Director (Assistant Engineer) in 1952. He is irresponsible in his work, engages in fraudulent practices, fabricates "experience," and obtains personal honors through deception. He shirked responsibility during the inspection process and was not honest in his attitude. It is decided to give him the punishment of removal from work within the Party and a demerit administratively.

V. Chen Shanli, Second Deputy Factory Director, joined the Party in 1947 and was recently promoted. His political and professional level is not high, and he showed a good understanding of his mistakes during the inspection. It is decided to exempt him from punishment.

VI. The fact that the serious errors committed by the Party and administrative leaders of the Transformer Factory have not been inspected and dealt with for a long time is inseparable from the bureaucratism of the Municipal Party Committee and the leadership of the former Electrical Industry Administration Bureau of the First Ministry of Machine Building Industry. They should conduct a self-criticism and earnestly improve their leadership style.

    中央监委会和监察部处理这一案件的决定
    新华社21日讯　中国共产党中央监察委员会、中华人民共和国监察部关于处理国营沈阳变压器厂领导干部闹不团结、损坏机器、危害生产案件的决定。全文如下：
    国营沈阳变压器厂几年来在工作中存在着不少严重问题，如损坏机器、产品质量低劣、弄虚作假、不认真学习苏联先进经验、领导干部闹不团结等，已经给国家造成了严重的损失。经中央和地方党的监察机关和国家监察机关联合检查，查明其主要错误事实如下：
    一、大量损坏、浪费国家资财，损坏机器设备。根据1954年1月到1955年第一季度的统计，生产损失、浪费和积压为1，270多万元，其中损失浪费为220万元；基建方面损失浪费积压从1952年到1954年为517万元，其中损失浪费为176万元。生产基建损失浪费积压共1，787万元，其中发生产品质量事故三十六次，共损失七十四万元。机器设备的损坏达到惊人的程度，全厂348台各式机床中，有90％已遭到不同程度的损伤。机器零件大量丢失，例如123台进口的精密新式机床，有四十四台丢失了要害部件。当使用新机器发生困难的时候，该厂领导干部不是组织工人很好地学习操作，而是将机器乱拆乱改，先后拆改进口的新式机器三十五台，其中将自动化装置改为人工操作或因为部件损失而改用人工操作的有十六台。同时，将原有机床四十三台闲置不用，造成大部机件丢失。该厂还有一部机件齐全的三吨电气化铁炉，别厂要求调用，他们拒不拨给，宁愿（经厂长批准）拆掉报废，打碎化铁。工人对这些错误行为提出意见，领导上拒不采纳。此外，自1954年以来，还发生过在出厂的变压器中夹有剪刀、手套、铁丝等危险物的事故十一起。
    二、片面地追求产量，忽视产品质量，以次品冒充合格品，欺骗国家和兄弟厂矿。据1953年和1954年的统计，不合格的大小变压器共出厂1，338台，不合格的电压电流互感器共出厂3，116台。现在库存的1，200多台小型变压器中，漏油、渗油的就有670多台，这些成品必须返修。已出厂的产品，往往成千台地被退回，或者要派人前往返修，1954年往返各地返修的费用达22万余元。受到损失的兄弟厂矿，仅1954年就有八十九个，其中有六个厂矿属于156项内的重点工程，十三个厂矿属于限额以上的工程。更严重的是，1954年2月，将明知不合格的变压器送到德国莱比锡去展览，展览期间发生漏油现象，只好将油倒出展览，给国家在国际上造成极坏的影响。
    三、不忠实执行国家计划，弄虚做假，骗取荣誉和奖金。变压器厂采取一系列欺骗党和国家的行为，骗得了全国电工系统“一等厂”的荣誉和大量企业奖金。如谎报超额完成1954年成本计划和利润计划，实际上连原计划还没有完成。有意降低产品的质量，设法掩护不合格品“过关”。谎报1954年完成基本建设任务为98.81％，实际上只完成58.47％。变压器厂从1953年以来向外介绍经验四十三篇，其中内容有虚假的有十六篇，职工讽刺说：“变压器厂是制造工作经验的母机。”
    四、不认真学习苏联的先进经验，拒绝执行苏联专家的正确建议，任意删改苏联技术资料。他们把学习苏联先进经验和正确执行苏联专家建议这项重要的政治任务，交给主任工程师汤明奇去领导，以汤为首的少数技术人员对学习苏联抱着拒绝的态度。苏联专家对于该厂产品质量低劣的问题，曾屡次提出建议，他们大都拒不执行。从1951年到1955年第一季度，苏联专家共提出建议374项，其中执行的或执行得较好的只占31％，大部分没有执行或执行得很不彻底。同时，他们还任意地大量修改图纸资料，将采用的三十一本苏联资料修改了二十八本，并按照修改了的图样大量生产，结果造成了严重的损失。
    五、该厂领导上存在着严重的右倾麻痹思想，在选拔干部和发展党员工作中重才轻德，降低党员条件，违反党的原则，造成该厂行政组织和党组织的严重不纯。
    造成以上错误的原因，主要是厂的党政领导干部长期闹不团结，放弃了对生产的领导和监督，党委书记郎宗颖骄傲自满，认为自己来厂最早，自称是厂的“座山虎”，与厂长争夺权力。厂长任俊杰认为自己是老党员，片面强调“一长制”，不尊重党的领导，拒绝党的批评和监督。他们勾心斗角，互相排斥，进行宗派拉拢。该厂党委书记和厂长的严重不团结现象直接影响到党的基层组织和行政科室车间干部不团结，因此给生产上造成了严重损失。
    根据以上情况，决定对有关人员作如下处理：
    一、党委书记郎宗颖，1945年入党。1950年来厂工作后，同前厂长、工会主席和现任厂长一贯闹不团结，放弃对生产的监督。平时欺上压下，实行家长式的领导。这次对检查工作表现幸灾乐祸，有意夸大厂长的错误。决定给予撤销党委书记的处分。
    二、厂长任俊杰（党委委员），1937年入党。1952年来厂后，在工作中片面强调“一长制”，不尊重党的领导，拒绝党的监督，同郎宗颖长期闹不团结。放弃对生产的领导。对产品质量低劣、事故多和损坏机器设备的错误负有直接的领导责任。决定党内给予撤销工作处分，行政上给予降职处分。
    三、党委组织部长兼纪律检查委员会副书记岳振山，1950年入党，历任该厂青年团总支副书记。在工作中一贯压制批评，在干部中挑拨离间，破坏团结，包庇有血债的反革命分子赵洪（亲戚）和坏分子田发春（岳父），明知其爱人伪造历史。不缴纳团费，不但不向组织报告，反而要干部科长为她解决入党问题，品质十分恶劣。决定开除他的党籍。
    四、第一副厂长张尚怡（党委委员），1948年入党，1952年提为副厂长（助理工程师），对工作不负责任，弄虚作假，伪造“经验”，骗取个人荣誉。在检查过程中推卸责任，态度不老实。决定党内给予撤销工作处分，行政上给予记过处分。
    五、第二副厂长陈善礼，1947年入党，新提拔不久，政治和业务水平不高，在检查中对错误的认识较好，决定免予处分。
    六、变压器厂党政领导干部所犯严重错误长期没有检查处理，是同市委和原第一机械工业部电气工业管理局领导方面的官僚主义分不开的，应进行检讨，切实改善领导作风。
