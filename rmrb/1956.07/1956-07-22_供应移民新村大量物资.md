Xinhua News Agency report:
More than 100,000 volunteer land reclaimers from Shandong Province have arrived in various parts of Heilongjiang Province. After settling in the new immigrant villages, local supply and marketing cooperatives have supplied a large quantity of materials based on their living habits and production characteristics. According to statistics from counties with the most immigrant villages, such as Gannan, Lindian, and Luobei: more than 27,000 head of draft animals such as horses and cattle have been supplied, as well as more than 4,620 sets of new-style animal-powered farm implements, in addition to other large quantities of small farm tools. The supply of various daily necessities needed for life, such as clothing, shoes, hats, yellow tobacco, and vegetables, has also been continuously improved. Supply and marketing cooperatives in various places have also specially organized the processing of tools needed by Shandong people to make "jianbing" – "aozi" (griddles). Qinggang, Zhaozhou, and other counties have also organized twelve sewing workers to process summer clothing for the land reclamation team members.

In terms of material supply, various counties have also adopted measures to prioritize the supply of certain insufficient daily commodities to new immigrant villages, ensuring the living needs of the land reclamation team members.

Not only do the supply and marketing cooperatives in the reclamation area strive to supply the materials needed by the land reclaimers, but they also help them make plans for developing sideline production, and promptly purchase native and sideline products from the reclamation area, ensuring increased income for them.

    供应移民新村大量物资
    来到黑龙江省各地的十多万名山东省志愿垦荒者，他们在移民新村定居后，各地供销合作社根据他们的生活习惯和生产特点，供应了大量的物资。据移民新村最多的甘南、林甸、萝北等县统计：已经供应了马牛等耕畜二万七千余头，新式畜力农具四千六百二十多套，另外还有其他大量小农具。生活上需要的各种日用品，如衣服、鞋帽、黄烟、蔬菜等的供应也不断有改进。各地供销社还特地组织加工山东人制作“煎饼”需要的工具——“鏊子”。青岗、肇州等县还组织了十二个缝纫工人为垦荒队员加工夏衣。
    各县在物资供应上，对某些不足的日用商品，还采取了优先供应移民新村的措施，保证了垦荒队员的生活需要。
    垦区供销社不仅努力供应垦荒者需要的物资，还帮助他们做发展副业生产的规划，及时收购垦区的土副产品，保证增加他们的收入。
