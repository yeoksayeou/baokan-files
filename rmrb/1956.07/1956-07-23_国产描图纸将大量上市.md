    Domestically Produced Tracing Paper to be Available in Large Quantities
    (Our Newspaper) News: The public-private joint venture Minfeng Paper Mill in Zhejiang Province has begun producing tracing paper in large quantities, and 50 tons will be supplied to the market by the end of July. Tracing paper is indispensable for industrial construction and production, and the demand is considerable. In the past, all the tracing paper used in our country was imported. Since the Dagong Bao published the news of the successful trial production of tracing paper by the Minfeng Paper Mill on June 12, more than 20 units in the metallurgical, machinery and other industrial departments have successively written to the Minfeng Paper Mill requesting rapid and large-scale production. The workers of the Minfeng Paper Mill will soon be able to meet these requirements. The quality of the tracing paper produced by the Minfeng Paper Mill this time has reached the Soviet standard and is even higher than that of some capitalist countries. The price is only 4,800 yuan per ton, which is half the price of imported goods. (Yang Changqi)

    国产描图纸将大量上市
    本报讯　浙江省公私合营民丰造纸厂开始大量生产描图纸，七月末将有五十吨供应市场。描图纸是工业建设和生产所不可缺少的，并且用量相当大。过去我国所用的描图纸，都是进口货。自从六月十二日大公报发表民丰造纸厂试制成功描图纸的消息以来，已经有冶金、机械等工业部门二十多个单位，先后去信要求民丰造纸厂迅速大量生产。对这些要求，民丰造纸厂的职工很快就可以予以满足。民丰造纸厂这次生产的描图纸质量达到苏联的标准，比某些资本主义国家的还高，每吨价格只有四千八百元，比进口货便宜一半。（杨昌琪）
