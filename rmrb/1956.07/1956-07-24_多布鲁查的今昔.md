    Dobruja: Then and Now
    Bulgaria Tao Duoluo fu Andeliejifu
    In northeastern Bulgaria, between the Black Sea and the Danube River, stretches the vast plain of Dobruja.
    Before liberation, life in Dobruja was unpleasant. At that time, Dobruja had a semi-feudal landlord land ownership system. More than half of the arable land belonged to a small number of landlords and rich peasants, while 78% of the peasants lived miserably on their small plots of land, cruelly exploited by the landlords.
    The bourgeoisie and landlords ruined Dobruja's fertile land. In the 50 or 60 years, the trees on the Dobruja mountains were cut down, the pastures were plowed, and most of the rivers dried up. The plains lost their beautiful scenery. In summer, the grain was dried up by hot winds before it ripened; in winter, the crops were attacked by cold winds and frozen to death. As a result, the land became increasingly barren. The harvest of the important crop wheat was as low as only about 100 kilograms per hectare.
    In the past, most villages were not connected by roads, but the greatest difficulty and suffering for the people of Dobruja was the lack of water. Drinking water was very scarce and had to be drawn from deep wells of 100 meters or more. But people had to pay for the water because the wells belonged to the landlords. In some villages, water even had to be transported from 11 or 12 kilometers away. The peasants lived in dilapidated small houses. The villages were dirty. There were very few public buildings, hospitals, or cultural palaces, and even schools were lacking.
    After liberation, during the land reform of 1945-1946, the people's democratic government confiscated more than 800,000 hectares of land from the big landlords and rich peasants, part of which was distributed to landless poor peasants, and the other part was used to establish state farms. After the land reform, the peasants began to quickly unite into agricultural production cooperatives. The degree of cooperativization reached 47% in 1950, and even reached 66% in 1955. If state farms are included, the socialist part of Dobruja agriculture accounts for more than 80%, and in some areas even 96% of all cultivated land.
    In 1951, the necessary prerequisites for eliminating agricultural backwardness and improving the material welfare of farmers had been established in our country. Therefore, the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party and the Council of Ministers formulated a seven-year plan to transform Dobruja, and passed the "Resolution on Developing Agriculture, Water Conservancy, and Electrification in Dobruja." The plan stipulates the establishment of state-owned protective forest belts, expansion of irrigation areas, improvement of soil and expansion of fertilization, guaranteeing the use of fine seeds, implementation of complete mechanization of farming, improvement of agricultural scientific research, ensuring that all settlements have water sources and achieve electrification, expanding and improving road and railway networks, and so on. After the implementation of this plan, Dobruja will become a highly developed animal husbandry and major grain base.
    By the end of 1957, all the measures stipulated in the resolution must be implemented. What the bourgeoisie could not do in seventy years can be accomplished by the working people under the leadership of the Bulgarian Communist Party in just a few years.
    On the land of state farms and agricultural production cooperatives in Dobruja, nine state-owned protective forest belts have been built, with a total length of 6,000 kilometers and an area of 153,000 hectares. Residents have planted trees on 40,000 hectares of barren land, and young forests have sprung up on the plains. These young forests help to improve the water situation of drought-stricken rivers, store large amounts of water in the soil, change the harmful effects of cold winter winds and hot summer winds, and increase and stabilize crop yields.
    Many agricultural machinery stations have been established in Dobruja. Currently, there are 27 machine tractor stations serving the agricultural production cooperatives in Dobruja. Last year, Dobruja had a total of 2,530 tractors, 762 grain combines, 60 corn combines, 70 threshing machines, and thousands of other agricultural machines. In the past few years, 2,400 agricultural buildings have been built in agricultural machinery tractor stations, state farms, and agricultural production cooperatives. Due to all these measures, the mechanization of various major field operations in agricultural production cooperatives and state farms has reached 80%, and in some counties it has reached 93%.
    The mechanization of field work and the adoption of advanced agronomic measures have gradually increased the unit area yield of crops. The average unit area yield of wheat in 1952 was 153 kilograms per hectare, while in 1955 it increased to 184 kilograms per hectare, corn increased from 120 kilograms to 250 kilograms, and so on. On the 8,200 hectares of land in the Chernokovo Village Agricultural Production Cooperative, 226 kilograms of wheat were harvested per hectare.
    Water supply work is also being carried out vigorously. This is such a huge undertaking for us! The length of the main water pipe network will reach 2,300 kilometers, and dozens of pumping stations, hundreds of water towers, reservoirs, wells, thousands of water pipes, and other equipment will be built.
    Before liberation, only three cities had water sources. Now, in the past five years, a water pipe network of 1,500 kilometers in length, many pumping stations and reservoirs have been built, and all cities and about 200 villages have water sources. Most of the residents of Dobruja no longer know the difficult life without water.
    The electrification of Dobruja is also accelerating. A 2,000-kilometer-long low-voltage power transmission network has been built, and all cities and 225 villages have been electrified, where more than 80% of the residents live. 222 kilometers of roads have been built, and most of the villages in Dobruja now have good roads.
    Now, the lives of the people of Dobruja have become better. For example, in the Victory Village of Torbuhin, there are very good shops. Electric lights are installed on the streets and in the houses, and almost every family has a radio. Veterinary clinics, health clinics, maternity hospitals, and permanent kindergartens have been opened. Public bakeries have also been built. Farmers have joined cooperatives, and most of them have built new houses. The doors of schools are wide open to the children of Dobruja farmers. The number of students and schools has almost doubled. In a few years, 30,000 illiterates have been eliminated. Now there are no people in Dobruja who cannot read and write. Seventy-nine new schools have been built, and these schools are enlivening the lives of the villages.
    Great changes have also taken place in health care. In the past, there were no doctors in the villages of Dobruja. The mortality rate was very high. Now, clinics and district hospitals, dental offices, and pharmacies have been established in all administrative center villages. The mortality rate has been reduced by more than 70%. As in the rest of the country, medical services here are also free.
    Due to the implementation of cooperativization, the income of farmers has also increased. For example, Rizhiu Tosyanov of Prolez Village in Balchik has been a farmhand for landlords since he was twelve years old. Life is getting better and better now. He said: "Since I joined the cooperative, I have often had grain income and savings. I built a new house. Last year, my income was 13 tons of wheat, corn, and barley, 97 kilograms of sunflower oil, 120 kilograms of cheese, 18 kilograms of wool, and 11,775 leva (Bulgarian currency) in cash. I bought wardrobes, soft beds, tables and chairs, carpets, and many other things. My two little girls – Stoyanka and Ivanka, put on new little dresses. A few months ago, we also bought a radio."
    In the past, only landlords had radios in their homes, but now almost 30,000 farmers, workers, and staff have radios in their homes, and 87 settlements have broadcasting equipment. The number of cinemas has increased to 75. Film projection teams tour various villages showing films from our country, the Soviet Union, China, India, Germany, Hungary, and other countries. In the past year, the audience reached 2.65 million people.
    Dobruja, which used to be the most backward area in our country, has now become a prosperous and modern socialist agricultural border area thanks to the care of the Party and the government and the efforts of the people.

    多布鲁查的今昔
    保加利亚  陶多罗夫  安德列耶夫
    在保加利亚东北部，黑海和多瑙河之间，延伸着辽阔的多布鲁查平原。
    解放以前，多布鲁查的生活是不愉快的。当时，多布鲁查存在着半封建的地主土地所有制。一大半的可耕地属于为数不多的地主和富农，而百分之七十八的农民则可怜地生活在自己的一小块土地上，被地主残酷地剥削着。
    资产阶级和地主们糟踏了多布鲁查的肥沃的土地。在五六十年期间内，多布鲁查山上的树木被砍伐殆尽，牧场被翻耕，大多数河流都干涸了。平原失去了美丽的风光。夏季，谷物还没有成熟就被热风吹干了；而到冬季，农作物又却受到寒风的吹袭而冻死了。结果这里的土地越来越瘠薄了。重要的作物小麦的收获量甚至低到只有每公顷一百来公斤。
    从前大多数的村庄都不同公路相联，但多布鲁查人最大的困难和痛苦是缺水。饮水是非常不充足的，不得不从一百公尺和一百公尺以上的深井里打水。但人们必须付钱才能得到水，因为井是属于地主的。在某些村庄里甚至要从十一、二公里的远处去运水。农民居住在破旧的小房子里。村庄是肮脏的。公共建筑物、医院、文化宫少得可怜，甚至连学校都是缺乏的。
    解放以后，在1945—1946年的土地改革中，人民民主政权从大地主和富农那里没收了八十万公顷以上的土地，这些土地的一部分分给了没有土地的贫农，另一部分建立了国营农场。土地改革以后农民开始迅速地联合到农业生产合作社里来。合作化的程度在1950年时就已达到了47％，而在1955年更达到了66％。如果把国营农场包括在内，则多布鲁查农业中的社会主义部分占到80％以上，某些地区甚至占全部耕地的96％。
    1951年，在我国已经建立了消除农业落后状态和提高农民的物质福利的必要前提。因此保加利亚共产党中央委员会和部长会议拟定了改造多布鲁查的七年计划，通过了“关于发展多布鲁查的农业、水利和实行电气化”的决议。计划规定建立国营防护林带，扩大灌溉面积，改进土壤和扩大施肥，保证用优良种子，实行耕作的完全机械化，改进农业科学研究工作，使所有的居民点都有水源并且实现电气化，扩大和改进公路网和铁路网，等等。在这个计划实现以后，多布鲁查将变成为一个畜牧业高度发展和主要谷物基地。
    到1957年底，决议规定的一切措施都要实现。资产阶级在七十年中所不能做的事情，在保加利亚共产党领导下的劳动人民只要几年期间就可以完成了。
    在多布鲁查国营农场和农业生产合作社的土地上，已经建造了九条国营防护林带，共长六千公里，面积十五万三千公顷。居民在四万公顷的不毛之地上植了树，幼林已经耸立在平原上了。这些幼林有助于改善干旱的河流的河水情况，在土壤中蓄积大量的水份，改变冬季寒风和夏季热风的有害影响，提高和稳定农作物的产量。
    在多布鲁查建立了许多农业机器站。现在为多布鲁查各农业生产合作社服务的，有二十七个机器拖拉机站。去年多布鲁查共有2，530部拖拉机、762部谷物联合收割机、六十部玉蜀黍联合机、七十部打谷机和几千部其他的农业机器。几年来，在农业机器拖拉机站、国营农场和农业生产合作社中建成了二千四百座农业建筑物。由于这一切措施，在农业生产合作社、国营农场中各种主要田间工作的机械化达到了80％，而有的县则达到了93％。
    田间工作的机械化和先进的农艺措施的采用，逐步提高了农作物的单位面积产量。1952年小麦的平均单位面积产量是每公顷153公斤，而在1955年就增加到每公顷184公斤，玉蜀黍从一百二十公斤增加到二百五十公斤，等等。而在切尔诺科村的农业生产合作社的八千二百公顷土地上，每公顷收获小麦226公斤。
    供水工作也在大力进行。这对我们来说是规模多么巨大的事情啊！主要水管网的长度将达二千三百公里，将建筑几十个抽水站、几百个贮水塔、贮水池、水井，几千条水管和其他设备。
    在解放以前，只有三个城市有水源。现在，五年来已经建成了长一千五百公里的水管网、许多抽水站和贮水池，而且所有的城市和大约二百个村庄都有水源。多布鲁查的大多数居民已经不知道没有水的艰难生活了。
    多布鲁查的电气化工作也加速进行着。已经建设了二千公里长的低压输电网，所有的城市和二百二十五个村庄都电气化了，在这些村庄里居住着80％以上的居民。建筑了二百二十二公里的公路，并且目前大部分多布鲁查的村庄都有良好的道路。
    现在，多布鲁查人的生活变得更好了。例如，在托尔布辛胜利村有很好的商店。街上和房子里都装置着电灯，差不多所有的家庭里都有无线电收音机。开办了兽医诊疗所、保健所、产科医院，还有常设的幼儿园。公共面包房也建成了。农民参加了合作社，他们之中的大部分都建筑了新的住宅。学校的大门为多布鲁查农民的子女大大地敞开着。学生和学校的数目差不多增加了一倍。在几年内已经扫除了三万个文盲。现在多布鲁查已经没有不会写和读的人了。建成了七十九所新学校，这些学校活跃着村庄里的生活。
    在卫生保健方面也发生了很大的变化。从前，在多布鲁查的村庄中没有医生。死亡率是很高的。现在，在所有行政中心的村庄中都设立了诊疗所和分区的医院、牙医室和药房。死亡率减低了70％以上。和全国一样，这里的医疗服务也是免费的。
    由于实行了合作化，农民的收入也增加了。例如，巴尔契克的普罗列兹村的日留·托斯扬诺夫，从十二岁起就给地主作雇农。现在的生活越来越美了。他说：“从我加入合作社的时候起，我就经常有谷物收入和积蓄。我盖了新房子。去年我得到的收入有十三吨小麦、玉蜀黍、大麦，九十七公斤向日葵油，一百二十公斤干酪，十八公斤羊毛和11，775利瓦（保币）的现金。我购置了衣柜、软床、桌椅、地毯和许多东西。我的两个小女孩——斯托扬卡和伊万卡穿上了新的小连衣裙。几个月以前我们还买了一架无线电收音机。”
    过去，只有在地主的家里才有无线电收音机，而现在差不多在三万个农民、工人和职员的家里都有了无线电收音机，八十七个居民点有广播设备。电影院的数目已增加到七十五家。电影放映队在各个村庄里巡回放映本国的和苏联、中国、印度、德国、匈牙利等国家的影片。在去年一年中观众达到二百六十五万人次。
    多布鲁查在过去是我国最落后的一个地区，现在由于党和政府的关怀和人民的努力建设，已变成了一个繁荣的、现代化的社会主义化农业边区了。
