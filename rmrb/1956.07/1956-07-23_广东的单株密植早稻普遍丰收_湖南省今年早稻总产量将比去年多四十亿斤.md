Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 21st. More than 1.46 million mu of early rice in Guangdong Province, planted using single or double-plant dense planting methods, have generally achieved a bumper harvest this year. In Chaoyang County, approximately 260,000 mu of early rice adopted this new technology, yielding an average of over 400 to 500 jin per mu, about 50 jin more than ordinary small-clump dense planting, and an increase of more than 30% compared to last year. Yunguang Agricultural Cooperative in Jieyang County achieved an average yield of 898 jin per mu on more than ten mu of early rice. The first agricultural cooperative in Shaxu Township, Panyu County, achieved an average of 1,067 jin per mu on more than one and two-tenths mu of land, one and a half times higher than the cooperative's general yield.

Single or double-plant dense planting of rice is an advanced technique newly promoted in Guangdong Province this year. The method involves sparsely sowing rice seeds and cultivating strong seedlings, then using robust tillering seedlings and three-footed seedlings for single or double-plant dense planting. The paddy fields must be fertile, with convenient water sources and good drainage and irrigation. It can be adopted wherever there is sufficient labor and technical experience in cultivating strong three-footed seedlings. Its advantages are: due to the strong and vigorous seedlings, there are many and uniform tillers after transplanting, uniform heading, and large, full ears of grain; moreover, the base stems are solid and not prone to lodging; therefore, the yield is high. Therefore, it must implement a series of new technical measures such as seed selection, sparse sowing, and strong seedlings, and must have better soil and water conservancy and other production conditions to ensure increased production.

Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, 21st. More than 15 million mu of early rice in Hunan Province have generally begun to be harvested. In Liling County, a high-yield double-cropping rice area, over 600,000 mu of early rice yielded an average of over 500 jin per mu, an increase of 15% compared to last year. The highest yield reached over 1,000 jin per mu. In the Dongting Lake area, the harvested early rice generally yields 400 to 500 jin per mu, with the highest reaching over 700 jin.

According to estimates by relevant departments, the total output of early rice in the province this year will increase by about 4 billion jin compared to last year.

Currently, in the main double-cropping rice producing areas of the Dongting Lake Plain and along the Xiang River, commune members of agricultural cooperatives are working hard to harvest early rice and rush to plant late rice, striving for a comprehensive bumper harvest of double-cropping rice.

### 广东的单株密植早稻普遍丰收  湖南省今年早稻总产量将比去年多四十亿斤

    广东的单株密植早稻普遍丰收
    湖南省今年早稻总产量将比去年多四十亿斤
    新华社广州21日电　广东省今年实行单株或双株密植的146万多亩早稻普遍丰收了。潮阳县约有二十六万亩早稻采用这种新技术，平均每亩收四百多至五百斤，比普通的小棵密植约多收五十斤，比去年增产30％以上。揭阳县云光农业社的十亩多早稻平均产量898斤。番禺县沙墟乡第一农业社有一亩二分多田平均一亩达到1，067斤，比社里一般产量高出一倍半。
    水稻单株或双株密植是广东省今年新推广的一种先进技术，它的方法是先把稻种疏播和培育壮秧，然后用茁壮的分蘖秧苗、三脚秧进行单株或双株密植。稻田必须肥沃，水源便利，排灌良好的。凡劳力充足，有培育三脚壮秧的技术经验的都可采用。它的好处是：由于秧苗壮旺，移植后分蘖多而且整齐，出穗整齐，穗大饱满；但又基干坚实不易倒伏；因而产量高。所以它必须贯彻选种、疏播和壮秧等一系列新的技术措施，并且要有较好的土壤和水利等生产条件，才能保证增产。
    新华社长沙21日电　湖南省一千五百多万亩早稻已经普遍开始收割。双季稻高产区醴陵县六十多万亩早稻平均每亩产量五百多斤，比去年增产一成半。最高的每亩达一千多斤。洞庭湖滨地区已收割的早稻一般每亩产四百斤到五百斤，最高的达七百多斤。
    据有关部门估计，今年全省早稻总产量将比去年增加四十亿斤左右。
    现在，双季稻主要产区洞庭湖滨平原和湘江两岸的农业社社员们，正在紧张的抢收早稻和赶种晚稻，争取双季稻全面丰收。
