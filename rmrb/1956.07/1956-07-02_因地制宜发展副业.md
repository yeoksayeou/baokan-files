Develop Sideline Occupations According to Local Conditions

	Mass Production of Straw Braid
	Agricultural Production Cooperatives in Shandong Province, a straw braid producing area, selected and stored a relatively abundant amount of straw braid raw material—wheat straw—during the wheat harvest.
	This year, Shandong Province plans to produce about 30,000 bundles of various straw braids (each bundle containing 240 braids, each braid being 120 yards long). To date, the Shandong Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative has purchased more than 12,700 bundles, of which 4,085 bundles have been sold abroad.
	Weaving straw braids is one of the sideline occupations that women in more than 20 counties in Shandong Province, such as Ye County, Changyi, and Xintai, have historically engaged in. This year, it is estimated that farmers in these more than 20 counties will increase their income by more than 5 million yuan as a result.

	Heilongjiang Honey to Have a Bumper Harvest
	The honey harvesting season has arrived in Heilongjiang Province. The bee farms, located in wild flower bushes, have begun to get busy. This year, the province plans to produce 30% more honey than in 1955, the year with the highest output.
	Heilongjiang Province's honey is white in color and has a sweet taste, making it very popular with customers. This year, the province will export 600 tons of honey.
	After the realization of full socialist agricultural cooperation in Heilongjiang Province, beekeeping has become an important sideline occupation for cooperative members.

	Deer Hunting, Deer Raising, and Antler Production
	Five agricultural production cooperatives in Yuli County, Xinjiang, recently organized deer farming groups to specialize in deer hunting and raising. They are now taming more than a dozen young deer captured this year from both banks of the Tarim River in preparation for producing deer antlers.
	There are large groups of wild elk on the lush grasslands along the lower reaches of the Tarim River and in the mountainous forest areas of northern Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region. Antlers have historically been one of Xinjiang's major export commodities. However, in the past, farmers and herdsmen of the Uygur, Kazakh, and other ethnic groups had not collectively raised herds of wild deer.

	Medicinal Herb Exhibition
	The "Great Storm" Agricultural Cooperative in Shuanghe Township, Enshi County, Hubei Province, which has rich experience in planting and collecting medicinal materials, recently held a medicinal herb exhibition. The exhibition was held to help members of other agricultural cooperatives in the township identify medicinal materials and carry out medicinal material production.
	The exhibition displayed a total of 72 kinds of medicinal herb samples. More than 500 people from the whole township visited it. Medicinal herb technician Yang Yuzhi and five others introduced the names and habitats of various samples to the audience in detail; cadres from the district supply and marketing cooperative told the audience about the current purchase prices and specifications of various medicinal materials.
	Shuanghe Township is a mountainous area. Recently, when various agricultural cooperatives discussed developing diversified operations, they planned to collect medicinal materials, but many people could not recognize them. This exhibition helped people solve this problem. (Xinhua News Agency)

    因地制宜发展副业
    大量编制草帽辫
    山东省草帽辫产地的农业生产合作社，在麦收中挑选、贮存了数量比较充裕的草帽辫原料——麦秸草。
    今年山东省计划生产各种草帽辫三万包左右（每包二百四十把，每把长一百二十码）。到目前为止，山东省供销合作社已经收购一万二千七百多包，其中有四千零八十五包销到国外。
    编制草帽辫，是山东省掖县、昌邑、新泰等二十多个县的妇女历来所从事的副业生产之一。今年预计，这二十多个县的农民将因此增加收入五百多万元。
    黑龙江蜂蜜将丰收
    黑龙江省割蜂蜜的季节已经到来了。设在野花丛中的一个个养蜂场已开始忙碌起来。今年，这个省计划生产的蜂蜜将比产量最高的1955年还增加30％。
    黑龙江省的蜂蜜色泽洁白，味道香甜，很受顾客欢迎。今年这个省出口的蜂蜜将有六百吨。
    黑龙江省实现了全社会主义的农业合作化后，养蜂已成为合作社社员们重要的副业生产。
    捕鹿养鹿制鹿茸
    新疆尉犁县有五个农业生产合作社最近组织了养鹿小组，专门捕鹿和养鹿。现在他们正把今年从塔里木河两岸捕获的十几只幼鹿加以驯养，准备生产鹿茸。
    塔里木河下游两岸丰美的草原上和新疆维吾尔自治区北部山林地带都有大群的野生麋鹿。鹿角是新疆历来外销的大宗货之一。但过去维吾尔、哈萨克等族的农民、牧民都还没有集体养过成群的野鹿。
    药材展览会
    湖北省恩施县双河乡种植和采集药材很有经验的“大风暴”农业社最近举办了一个药材展览会。这个展览会是为帮助乡里其他农业社社员辨认药材开展采药生产而举办的。
    展览会共计展出七十二种药材的样品。全乡先后前往参观的有五百多人。药材技术员杨玉枝等六人详细地向观众介绍了各种样品的药名、生长地；区供销合作社的干部给观众讲了各种药材现在收购的牌价和规格。
    双河乡是个山区，最近各农业社讨论开展多种经营的时候，准备采集药材，但是很多人认不清。这个展览会帮助人们解决了这个问题。　（新华社）
