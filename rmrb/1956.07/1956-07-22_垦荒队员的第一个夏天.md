    The 3,942 young land reclamation team members from cities and counties in Jilin Province are spending their first summer in the thirty-five new farms they have built with their own hands from the wilderness of Jilin Province.
    When they first came from the city this spring, this place was still a deserted wilderness. They used their own hands to break open the frozen soil and sow seeds on more than 6,000 hectares of land. At present, the rice, sorghum, corn, and soybeans planted by the farms have grown luxuriantly.
    Now these young farm members are busy carrying out the second and third weeding.
    In the past six months, they have initially mastered the skills of agricultural production. Through labor training, their bodies have become much stronger than when they first came, and their political consciousness has also greatly improved.

    垦荒队员的第一个夏天
    吉林省各市、县城镇的3，942名青年垦荒队员，正在他们从吉林省的荒山野地中亲手建立起来的三十五个新农庄里度着第一个夏天。
    今年春天他们刚从城市来的时候，这里还是一片荒无人烟的野地。他们用自己的双手刨开了冻土，在六千多公顷的土地上播下种子。目前各农庄栽培的水稻、高粱、苞米和大豆等庄稼，都已经枝叶茂盛。
    现在这些青年庄员们正在忙于进行第二遍和第三遍除草。
    半年来，他们已经初步掌握了农业生产的本领。在劳动锻练中，身体都比刚来时强壮得多了，政治觉悟也有很大提高。
