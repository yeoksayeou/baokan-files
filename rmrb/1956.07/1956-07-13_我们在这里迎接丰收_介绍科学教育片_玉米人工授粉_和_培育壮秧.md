    We Greet the Harvest Here
    – Introducing the Science Education Films “Artificial Pollination of Corn” and “Cultivating Strong Seedlings”
    Huang Zongzhen
    What is sown are seeds, and what is harvested are also seeds. How can we increase the yield of crop seeds and win a good harvest? From the science education films "Artificial Pollination of Corn" and "Cultivating Strong Seedlings," we can see that this requires not only hard work but also contains mysterious scientific principles.
    If you peel open the husk of a mature corn ear, you will often find that the kernels on the ear are not very plump. Some are uneven in size, and some are even shriveled. Why can't corn ears produce plump kernels? The film "Artificial Pollination of Corn" provides an answer. It turns out that the male flowers of corn grow on the top of the plant. Many male flowers grow together, forming the tassel. The female flowers, however, grow in clusters on a fleshy, swollen ear on the side of the plant. Each female flower has a slender style, gathered like a bundle of fluffy whiskers at the top of the ear. When the male flowers bloom, the pollen falls on the stigmas of the female flowers, and after the female flowers are fertilized, kernels gradually grow. But there is also often this situation: if there is a strong wind or heavy rain, the pollen is scattered or disappears completely; if there is a drought, the male flowers bloom early, and by the time they wither, the female flowers are just budding and drawing out a few thin, thread-like styles. Pollen cannot easily fall on the stigmas of the female flowers, the female flowers have few opportunities to be fertilized, and therefore cannot produce plump kernels.
    The film "Artificial Pollination of Corn" tells us that artificial pollination can ensure that the female corn flowers are fully pollinated and produce plump kernels. Here, we see male and female farmers busy carrying out artificial pollination. They use various light tools to collect the pollen when the corn flowers are in full bloom, and then sprinkle it on the stigmas of the female flowers. In this way, corn can increase its yield because it obtains ample pollination opportunities, and at the same time, the quality of the corn variety can be improved. Because the collected pollen is mixed together, artificial pollination can cause the corn varieties to cross, strengthening the contradiction between the male and female genders, thereby greatly enhancing the viability of the offspring seeds.
    The film "Cultivating Strong Seedlings" mainly introduces the methods of cultivating strong seedlings through the situation of the seedling cultivation of the Lianmin Agricultural Production Cooperative led by Chen Yongkang, a national model of high rice yield.
    The seedlings of the Lianmin Agricultural Production Cooperative are fat and strong, a green, smooth, and steady expanse, just like a large velvet carpet, truly lovely! The main experience for these seedlings being able to grow so strong is "sparse sowing." Sowing the seeds relatively sparsely not only enables the seedlings to obtain ventilation and light, but also each seedling has a certain amount of nutritional space, and the roots can absorb sufficient nutrients and moisture, making it easier to grow strong.
    To make the seedlings grow fat and strong, the seed selection work is also very important. The film tells us about the methods of selecting seeds with salt water and muddy water. When the seeds are mixed in muddy water or salt water, barnyard grass and half-grains of rice can float up.
    To make the seedlings grow fat and strong, careful cultivation and harrowing are also very necessary. We see the cooperative members cultivating and harrowing the soil very finely, and making the seedling beds flat and even, which makes it easier to control the amount of water and prevent the seedlings from rotting. "Ninety percent of the harvest depends on the seedlings in ten years." With fat and strong seedlings, a good harvest is hopeful.
    At the end of the films "Artificial Pollination of Corn" and "Cultivating Strong Seedlings," the screen shows scenes of harvest: the plump, pearl-like kernels of corn bursting out of the husks; the heavy, laden ears of grain hanging their heads... Hard work has already been rewarded with a rich harvest!
    Let advanced agricultural technical experience be promoted more quickly, and let us greet the harvest here!

    我们在这里迎接丰收
    ——介绍科学教育片“玉米人工授粉”和“培育壮秧”
    黄宗甄
    播种的是种子，收获的也是种子。怎样能使农作物的种子产量增加，怎样能赢得丰收呢？从科学教育片“玉米人工授粉”和“培育壮秧”中，我们可以看出，这除了需要付出辛勤的劳动外，也还包含着奥秘的科学原理。
    如果你用手剥开一个成熟了的玉米果穗的苞叶，常常会发现果穗上结的籽粒并不是很丰满的。有些地方大小不齐，有些地方甚至是干瘪瘪的。为什么玉米果穗不能丰满地结实呢？影片“玉米人工授粉”作了解答。原来玉米的雄花是生在植株的头顶上的。许多雄花簇生在一起，成为雄穗。雌花却是簇生在植株腰间的一个多肉臃肿的果穗上。每朵雌花都有一条细长的花柱，像一束蓬松的须发一样集合在果穗的顶端。雄花开花了，花粉落在雌花的柱头上，雌花受精以后，就逐渐孳生出籽粒来。但是也往往有这种情形：如果碰到狂风暴雨，花粉被弄得七零八落或者完全无影无踪；如果碰到干旱，雄花开花早，在它萎谢的时候，雌花才刚含着苞抽出几根细丝似的花柱。花粉就不容易落到雌花的花柱上，雌花很少有受精机会，也就结不出饱满的籽粒来了。
    影片“玉米人工授粉”告诉我们，施行人工授粉可以使玉米雌花得到充分授粉机会，结出饱满的籽粒来。在这里，我们看到男女农民正在为进行人工授粉忙碌着。他们运用种种轻便的工具，在玉米花盛开的时候，将花粉搜集起来，然后再撒在雌花的花柱上。这样玉米就因为获得充分的授粉机会而增加产量，同时还可以改善玉米品种的质量。因为搜集来的花粉是混合在一起的，经过人工授粉，可以发生玉米的品种的杂交作用，加强雌雄两性之间的矛盾性，从而就大大增强后代种子的生活力了。
    影片“培育壮秧”主要是通过全国水稻丰产模范陈永康领导的联民农业生产合作社培养秧苗的情况，介绍了培育壮秧的方法。
    联民农业生产合作社的秧苗长得又肥又壮，绿油油的平平稳稳的一片，就像一块大绒毡一样，真是可爱极了！这些秧苗能够长得这样壮，主要的经验是“稀播”。种子播得比较稀，不但能使长出的秧苗获得通风透光的条件，而且每棵秧苗都有一定的营养地方，根能吸收充分的养料和水分，就容易长得健壮了。
    要使秧苗长得肥壮，选种工作也是很重要的。影片告诉我们用盐水和泥水选种的方法。种子合在泥水或盐水里，稗子和半粒米都能漂浮上来了。
    要使秧苗长得肥壮，精耕细耙也是很必要的。我们看到社员们将泥土耕耙得很碎烂，将秧板做得平平整整，这样就容易控制水量，不会烂秧。“十成年景，九成靠秧”。秧苗肥壮，收成也就有望了。
    影片“玉米人工授粉”和“培育壮秧”在结尾的时候，画面上都出现了丰收的景象：玉米的丰满的珍珠一样的籽粒绽在苞叶外；结实累累的谷穗垂下了它们的头……。辛勤的劳动已经换得了丰盛的收成！
    让先进的农业技术经验更快地推广，让我们在这里迎接丰收吧！
