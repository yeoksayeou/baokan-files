Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, July 24th: Indonesian Prime Minister Ali Sastroamidjojo said in Semarang on July 23rd that he fully agreed with the outcome of the talks held by the leaders of India, Egypt, and Yugoslavia in Brioni because it reflected the Bandung spirit.

Antara News Agency quoted the Prime Minister as saying that the resolutions of the Asian-African Conference should indeed be implemented and not just treated as decorative documents. He said that he would be very happy if the Brioni meeting meant that the Ten Principles of the Asian-African Conference would be equally active in the European political atmosphere.

Sastroamidjojo believes that it would have been better if the five Colombo countries had consulted before the Brioni meeting. He stated that he had suggested making Egypt a member of the Colombo countries before the Brioni meeting. Currently, the Colombo countries refer to India, Indonesia, Burma, Pakistan, and Ceylon.

    沙斯特罗阿米佐约说
    南印埃会谈反映万隆精神
    新华社雅加达24日电　印度尼西亚总理阿里·沙斯特罗阿米佐约七月二十三日在三宝垄说，他完全同意印度、埃及和南斯拉夫领袖在布里俄尼举行的会谈的结果，因为它反映了万隆精神。
    安塔拉通讯社述这位总理的话说，亚非会议的决议的确应该予以实行而不只是当成装饰性的文件。他说，如果布里俄尼会议意味着亚非会议的十项原则将同样活跃在欧洲政治气氛中，那他将感到很高兴。
    沙斯特罗阿米佐约认为，如果在布里俄尼会议以前，五个科伦坡国家进行了协商的话，那就会更好了。他表明，在布里俄尼会议举行以前，他曾经建议使埃及成为科伦坡国家的成员。目前科伦坡国家是指印度、印度尼西亚、缅甸、巴基斯坦和锡兰五国。
