St. Peter's Basilica
It is said that the three largest churches in the world are in Rome, Milan, and Paris, and St. Peter's Basilica is the largest of these. This church is in Vatican City, next to the famous museum. The police, dressed in the ancient uniforms of Swiss mercenaries, are the Pope's personal guards, and it is said that many of them are actually mercenaries hired from Switzerland. The Vatican is an independent country, but these papal guards, who do not object to tourists taking pictures of them, also do not check tourists' passports; the archway-like structure is only a symbolic border.

The interior of St. Peter's Basilica is magnificent, but the square in front of it is even more grand. This tall church uses two semi-circular stone colonnades as its wings, making the church appear even more magnificent.

The Vatican Museum's collection is simply dazzling. Raphael's "Assumption of the Virgin" and "Ascension of Christ," Michelangelo's "Moses"... Especially the countless ancient Greek and Roman sculptures; these works by anonymous artists are each astonishingly detailed and beautiful. However, these nude statues, both male and female, have been adorned with a fig leaf for modesty, supposedly done on the orders of a former pope.

The most famous part of the Vatican Museum is of course the paintings on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel, Michelangelo's masterpiece. Tourists will always hear a rare lively explanation amid the tour guide's monotonous introduction: "The great painter wanted to take revenge on a bishop who was supervising his painting, so he painted this sharp-tongued supervisor into the picture and had a poisonous snake wrapped around him. The supervising bishop had to plead for the Pope's grace to have the painter add clothes to the bishop to cover his shame."

Dozens of kilometers from Rome is a small city called Tivoli. This city is famous for its famous fountain park. This is a private garden built by a pope in the 16th century, which diverted all the water from a small river flowing down from the hill into the palace, using this water to irrigate the various fountains in the garden. Artistically speaking, this is a model of Renaissance architecture, exquisite and elegant, and with a special decorative style. There is a road in the garden with hundreds of fountains, which people call "The Road of a Thousand Fountains." In another place, spring water hangs like a beaded curtain at the entrance of a cave, and under the path outside the cave entrance is a large lake. People can walk through the small path under the cave entrance formed by the beaded curtain of fountains. The Italian friend accompanying us pointed to the actor playing the Monkey King and said: I heard that your hometown is called "Fairy Cave with a Curtain of Water Beads," this is really a Water Curtain Cave.

The day we arrived in this city, the residents were holding the "Newspaper Day" of the Italian Communist Party's newspaper "L'Unità." The city council of this city is completely controlled by progressive parties, and the mayor is a communist. In Italy, many local councils, like the Tivoli city council, have left-wing parties as the majority in the council. The residents of this lovely city welcomed the Chinese artists as honored guests, adding a layer of joy to the already festive small town.

    欧游散记
    〔二十〕
    圣彼得教堂
    据说，罗马、米兰、巴黎的三个教堂是世界上最大的教堂，而圣彼得教堂又是其中最大的一个。这个教堂在梵蒂冈城，教堂旁边便是著名的博物馆。穿着瑞士佣兵式的古代制服的警察，是教皇的亲兵，据说其中不少还真是由瑞士雇来的佣兵呢。梵蒂冈是独立的国家，但这些并不反对游人替他们撮影留念的教皇亲兵们也不检查游客的护照，那个城门式的建筑只是象征性的国境线罢了。
    圣彼得教堂内部是伟大的，但更宏伟的是它前面的广场。这个高大的教堂用两个半圆的石制廊柱作为它的两翼，使这个教堂更加显得宏伟。
    梵蒂冈博物馆的收藏之多简直令人目不暇给。拉斐尔的圣母升天和基督升天，米盖朗基罗的摩西像……。特别是多到不胜枚举的古希腊和罗马雕塑，这些无名作家的作品，每一个都是惊人的细致和美丽。但是这些裸体的雕像，无论男女都被加上一片树叶来遮羞，据说是根据从前一位教皇的命令才这样做的。
    梵蒂冈博物馆中最著名的当然还是圣西斯丁教堂的天花板上的图画，这是米盖朗基罗的杰作。游览者总会在导游者的刻板的介绍中听到少见的生动的说明：“伟大的画家要报复监守他作画的一位主教大人，把这位尖刻的监工者画到画面上，并且使毒蛇缠在他身上。监工的主教大人不得不请求教皇恩典，才让画家为这位主教添上遮羞的衣裳。”
    离罗马几十公里有个小城市，叫做狄沃里城。这个城市因有著名的喷泉公园而著名。这是十六世纪时一个教皇修建的私人庭园，把一条从小山上流下来的一条小河的河水全部引入宫堡中，利用这些水灌到这个花园中的各种各样的喷泉中去。从艺术上说，这是文艺复兴式建筑的典范，精致而典雅，并且具有着特别的装饰风格。园内一条路上有着数以百计的喷泉，人们称之为“万泉路”。另一个地方，在山洞口上垂着像珠帘似的泉水，洞口外面的小路下边是个大湖。人们可以从挂着用喷泉形成的珠帘下的洞口小路走过。同行的意大利朋友指着我们饰演猴王的演员说：听说你的家乡叫做“挂着水珠的帘子的仙洞”，这里真是水帘洞呢。
    我们到这个城市的那一天，居民们正举行意大利共产党机关报“团结报”的“报刊日”。这个城市的市议会完全由进步党派掌握，市长由一位共产党员担任。在意大利，有许多地方议会都像狄沃里城议会一样，左翼政党是议会的多数派。这个可爱的城市的居民们把中国艺术家当作贵宾来欢迎，使本来已是节日的小城，更加上一层喜悦的色彩。（附图片）（下图为圣彼得教堂的前景）美丽的喷泉城
