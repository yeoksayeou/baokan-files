    New Technology on Yangtze River Steamships
    (Our dispatch) A device to solve the most troublesome boiler scaling problem—the "electronic water descaler"—has been installed on ten steamships on the Yangtze River, including the "Quxia" and "Baxia". On these ships, the difficult task of cleaning boiler scale has become a breeze.

    In the past, ships sailing on the Yangtze River had to rely on manual cleaning of scale. The two to three thousand seamless steel pipes densely packed within the boiler had to be cleaned one by one, requiring three to four days of downtime for each cleaning. Because scale accumulated quickly, fuel consumption was high, and the lifespan of the boilers was affected. The "electronic water descaler" utilizes high-frequency electronic force of approximately 18,000 cycles per second. This causes the mineral salt impurities in the water passing through the descaler to no longer solidify into hard scale after being treated by high-frequency oscillation electronic force, but instead become fine, sand-like particles. This device can also cause existing scale inside the boiler to detach. After installing the "electronic water descaler" on the boiler, flushing the boiler takes at most one day.

    川江轮船上的新技术
    本报讯　一种解决锅炉水垢最有效的装置——“电子水解器”已经在川江上的“瞿峡”、“巴峡”等十艘轮船上装置起来。在这些轮船上，清洗锅炉水垢的困难工作，已经成为一件轻而易举的事情了。
    航行在川江上的轮船，过去都是用人工清洗水垢。密布锅炉内的二三千根无缝钢管，必须一根一根地去清洗，洗一次就要停航三四天。由于水垢沉积快，燃料消耗大，对锅炉寿命也有影响。“电子水解器”是利用每秒约一万八千次频率的高周波电子力，使通过水解器的水内矿盐杂质，经过高周波振荡电子力处理后，不再结为坚硬的固体，而成为泥沙般的细粒。这种装置还能使锅炉内原来的水垢脱落。在锅炉上装置“电子水解器”后，冲洗一次锅炉，最多只要一天的时间。
