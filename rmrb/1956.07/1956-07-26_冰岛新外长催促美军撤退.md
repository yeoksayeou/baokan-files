Xinhua News Agency, Oslo, July 25th: Iceland's new Foreign Minister, Guðmundur Guðmundsson, reiterated Iceland's unwavering decision to withdraw U.S. troops from the Keflavík Air Base during a meeting with Norwegian government leaders in Oslo on July 24th.

Guðmundsson also stated that Iceland does not intend to withdraw from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).

According to the Danish newspaper "Land og Folk," the "People's Alliance," which is part of the new Icelandic government, had expressed the hope that Iceland would withdraw from NATO. However, this proposal did not receive the support of the Social Democratic Party and the Progressive Party.

Guðmundsson arrived in Oslo on July 22nd, the day after the Icelandic government was formed. He is reportedly holding several days of "private" talks with Norwegian government officials there.

    冰岛新外长催促美军撤退
    新华社25日讯　奥斯陆消息：冰岛新任外交部长格德门德尔·格德门森七月二十四日在奥斯陆同挪威政府领袖举行的会谈中，重申冰岛坚定不移的决定：要美国军队撤出凯夫拉维克空军基地。
    格德门森同时表示，冰岛并不打算退出北大西洋集团。
    据丹麦“国土与人民报”报道，参加冰岛新政府的“人民联合”曾经表示希望冰岛退出北大西洋集团，但是，这种主张没有得到社会民主党和进步党的支持。
    格德门森是在冰岛政府组成的第二天（七月二十二日）到达奥斯陆的。据报道，他将在那里同挪威政府官员举行几天“私下”的会谈。
