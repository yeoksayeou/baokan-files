Xinhua News Agency report: To date, excessively long working hours for employees in the national state-run commercial system has become a widespread and serious problem, especially in some grassroots units of department stores, food companies, and retail companies. According to key investigations, employees in these units generally work more than ten hours a day. Due to excessively long working hours, employees do not get adequate rest, suffer from sleep deprivation, become excessively fatigued, and experience increased rates of illness. Excessively long working hours also hinder employees' cultural, political, and professional development, impede their recreational and sports activities, and affect their family life and the education of their children.

The National Commercial Enterprise Labor Protection and Welfare Work Conference, jointly convened by the Ministry of Commerce and the National Committee of the China Commercial Trade Union, has proposed a reasonable solution to the problem of excessively long working hours for employees in the state-run commercial system.

The conference believes that to solve the problem of excessively long working hours, it is first necessary to strengthen education on labor protection policies, especially to ensure that leaders at all levels, while concerned with the completion of national plans, also establish a mindset of caring for the health and lives of the working masses.

In order to effectively correct the phenomenon of excessively long working hours, the Ministry of Commerce has formulated the "Provisional Measures on Working Hours for State-Run Commercial Enterprises (Draft)." This conference focused on studying these measures and proposed revised and supplementary opinions, which are to be submitted to the upcoming national conference of provincial and municipal commercial department and bureau directors for approval and implementation.

The measures stipulate that, without affecting external business hours, the vast majority of employees, such as sales personnel, factory workers, and general office staff, should implement a standard eight-hour workday. Workers in factories engaged in particularly heavy or health-hazardous work may have their working hours reduced to seven or six hours; underage employees or female employees during pregnancy may have their working hours appropriately shortened. The measures also stipulate that, based on the needs of market seasonal changes, with the approval of designated authorities, working hours may exceed eight hours a day for a certain period of time, up to a maximum of ten hours. However, the extended workday for urban commercial enterprises should not exceed sixty days per year, and for county and town enterprises, it should not exceed ninety days. To prevent excessive overtime, the measures stipulate that continuous overtime should not exceed two instances; the total number of overtime hours per year should not exceed one hundred and twenty hours in large and medium-sized cities and sixty hours in counties and towns. Whether it is an extended workday or overtime, employees should be given equal time off or paid additional wages.

The measures emphasize the need to ensure that employees have rest on public holidays, while opposing lax labor discipline during the prescribed working hours.

The conference pointed out that the utilization of labor should be improved, as unreasonable labor utilization is often an important cause of labor waste and unnecessarily prolonged working hours.

In addition to the issue of working hours, the conference also studied how to gradually solve specific problems such as employee housing difficulties, childcare centers, and living allowances.

Xinhua News Agency, July 1st: The Beijing State-Run Commercial System is implementing the Labor Insurance Regulations starting today. More than 35,000 employees will henceforth enjoy the benefits stipulated by the Labor Insurance Regulations. Based on the current wage levels, the state will allocate more than 600,000 yuan annually in insurance funds to help them solve economic difficulties caused by birth, old age, illness, death, injury, and disability; if we add subsidies for medical care, welfare, and recreation, the state will pay approximately more than 3.5 million yuan annually.

In the past few years, employees in the Beijing State-Run Commercial System have implemented collective labor insurance contracts, and their material lives have improved to some extent. However, due to limited funds, there were not many subsidized items, and many employees' life difficulties could not be resolved in a timely manner, especially for employees with many children, who faced even greater difficulties due to having to pay all medical expenses for their immediate family members' illnesses.

After the implementation of the Labor Insurance Regulations, the state will not only bear all medical expenses for employees' immediate family members when they are ill, but also increase the subsidy for medicine expenses from 40% to 50%. The administrative leaders and trade union organizations of the Beijing State-Run Commercial System have also decided to fully repay employees' debts incurred due to supporting immediate family members, medical treatment, and having many children, before July 15th. The Beijing State-Run Vegetable Company has already repaid more than 20,000 yuan in debt for its employees.

    纠正工作时间过长现象
    全国国营商业绝大部分职工将实行八小时工作制
    北京市三万五千多名国营商业职工享受劳保待遇
    据新华社讯　直到目前为止，全国国营商业系统职工工作时间过长已经成为一种普遍而严重的问题，尤其是在百货、食品和零售公司的若干基层单位。根据重点调查，这些单位职工每天的工作时间一般都在十小时以上。由于工作时间过长，职工得不到适当休息，睡眠不足，疲劳过度，疾病率增高。工作时间过长，也妨碍了职工的文化、政治和业务学习，妨碍了职工的文娱体育活动，影响了职工的家庭生活以及对子女的教育。
    商业部、中国商业工会全国委员会召开的全国商业企业劳保福利工作会议，对国营商业系统职工工作时间过长的问题提出了合理的解决办法。
    会议认为解决工作时间过长的问题，首先必须加强劳动保护政策教育，特别要使各级领导人员在关心国家计划完成的同时，树立关心职工群众健康和生活的思想。
    为了有效地纠正工作时间过长的现象，商业部曾经制定“国营商业企业工作时间暂行办法（草案）”。这次会议着重研究了这个办法，并且提出了修正补充的意见，准备提交最近召开的全国各省、市商业厅、局长会议上通过后公布实行。
    办法规定：在不影响对外营业时间的原则下，售货人员、加工厂工人和科室一般职员等绝大部分职工，都要实行八小时的标准工作日制度。加工厂中从事特别繁重或有害健康的工作的职工，工作时间可以缩短为七小时或六小时；未成年的职工或女职工在怀孕期间，可以适当缩短工作时间。办法还规定，根据市场季节变化的需要，经过一定机关的批准，在一定时间之内，每天工作时间可以超过八小时，最多到十小时。但是城市商业企业单位延长工作日全年不得超过六十天，县镇不得超过九十天。为了防止过多的加班加点，办法规定连续加班加点不得超过两次；全年加班加点总时数，在大中城市不得超过一百二十小时，县镇不得超过六十小时，无论是延长工作日或加班加点，都应该给予相等时间的补休息或加发一定的工资。
    办法强调必须保证职工在公休假日的休息，同时在规定工作时间内要反对劳动纪律松弛的现象。
    会议指出劳动力的使用情况应当改善，因为劳动力使用不合理，常常是造成劳动力浪费和不必要地延长工作时间的重要原因。
    除了工作时间的问题以外，这次会议还研究了如何逐步解决职工住宅困难、托儿所、生活补助费等具体问题。
    新华社1日讯　北京市国营商业系统从今天起实行劳动保险条例。三万五千多名职工从此享受劳动保险条例所规定的待遇。按照现行工资水平，国家每年将拨给他们六十多万元保险金帮助解决因生、老、病、死、伤、残等所引起的经济困难；如果加上在医药卫生、福利、文娱等方面的补助，国家每年支付的资金大约在三百五十万元以上。
    在过去几年中，北京市国营商业系统的职工曾实行劳动保险集体合同，职工们的物质生活有了一定的改善。但由于资金少，补助的项目不多，许多职工生活中的困难得不到及时解决，特别是子女多的职工，由于要支付直系亲属治病的全部医疗费，困难更大。
    实行劳动保险条例后，国家不但负担职工直系亲属有疾病时的全部医疗费，药费的补助也由过去的40％增到50％。北京市国营商业行政领导和工会组织，还决定在七月
  十五日以前，代职工全部偿还因供养直系亲属、治病和子女多而欠的债务。北京市国营菜蔬公司已经给职工偿还了二万多元的债务。
