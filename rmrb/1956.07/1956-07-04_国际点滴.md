    Japanese Students' Hard Lives
    Japanese university students live a very hard life. Many students work and study, working more than twenty-five hours a week. Some drive taxis, some sell things on the street, or do odd jobs in government offices. It is very common for university students to sell blood. Many university students live in dilapidated apartments, and they are lucky if they can eat one hot meal a day. As a result, many university students suffer from tuberculosis. Despite this, the Japanese government decided to increase tuition fees by half when formulating the draft budget for 1956.
    The U.S. Constitution and Soap Bubbles
    During a recent election registration in Mississippi, several black voters were asked the question: "How many bubbles are in a bar of soap?"
    Election laws in some U.S. states stipulate that voters must be able to answer questions about the Constitution. It is said that the question about bubbles in soap was used to test whether these black voters understood the Constitution.
    These black voters were of course unable to answer, so they were "legally" deprived of their right to vote.

    日本学生生活困苦
    日本大学生生活很苦。许多学生半工半读，每周要做二十五小时以上的工作。他们有的开出租汽车，有的在街上卖东西，或者到机关里做一些零碎事情。大学生卖血已很普遍。许多大学生在破旧的公寓里安身，一天能吃到一顿热饭就算好的了。因此，许多大学生患了肺结核。尽管如此，日本政府在制定1956年度预算草案时还决定把学费提高一半。
    美国宪法和肥皂泡
    在美国密士失必州最近举行的一次选举的登记中，几个黑人选民被问到了这样一个问题：“一块肥皂里有多少泡沫？”
    在美国某些州的选举法上规定，选民必须要能够回答一些有关宪法的问题。据说，这个关于肥皂中的泡沫的问题就是用来测验这几个黑人选民是否懂得宪法的。
    这几个黑人选民当然回答不出，于是他们就“依法”被剥夺了选举权。
