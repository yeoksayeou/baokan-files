    The Stirring "Wuhan Flood Prevention Picture"
    Yu Feian
    Since I can remember (the late Qing Dynasty), it seems there have never been grand, moving masterpieces of traditional Chinese painting. After 1911, classical paintings gradually dispersed among the people. The study and development of the tradition of national painting has made great progress compared to before, but there are still limited large-scale works by artists who delve into life or undergo sketching. Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, due to the correctness of the Party's literary and artistic policy and the attention and care for national painting, the creation of traditional Chinese paintings has progressed and improved year by year, and many excellent works have emerged. This second National Chinese Painting Exhibition has more and better works than the first one. Among them, the "Wuhan Flood Prevention Picture" scroll, I believe, is a rare grand and moving masterpiece in recent decades. This scroll is one of the moving modern works I have seen in my life.
    The author of "Wuhan Flood Prevention Picture," Li Xiongcai, used a long scroll of about eight zhang (approximately 26.67 meters) long and less than one chi (approximately 0.33 meters) high to create this painting. Some say that the author's brushwork and techniques are from the Lingnan School; others say that he was also influenced by the painters of Western Sichuan. I am not familiar with the author. I am just talking about the painting itself. I may make many mistakes. I ask the readers and the author to correct me.
    From the author's inscription on this painting, we can roughly understand his creative process: In the autumn of 1954, the water level of the Yangtze River in Wuhan rose sharply, exceeding the highest water level in 1931, which was unprecedented in a century. More than 289,000 people participated in the flood prevention struggle. From the beginning to the end of the struggle, it lasted a hundred days. Under the leadership of the Party and with the support of the people of the whole country, a historical miracle was created. The author also personally experienced this struggle at that time and was deeply moved, so he created the "Wuhan Flood Prevention Picture" scroll to commemorate the event. This painting was sketched by the author on Zhanggong Dike in September 1954 and completed in 1956. From this, we can easily see that the success of this painting is primarily due to the author's deep feeling for this vivid event. At the same time, he collected and accumulated rich materials in the actual struggle. How to handle, arrange, and express this subject matter is directly related to the author's artistic accomplishment. We see that the author uses the national form of a long scroll, and we also need to see how he highlights the theme in his expression techniques, how he attracts people, how he turns and concludes, and how he runs through, echoes, and relates from beginning to end. All of this takes great effort.
    The content of "Wuhan Flood Prevention Picture" has twelve sections. The first section depicts: a summer day shrouded in rain clouds, looking towards the Yellow Crane Tower in Wuchang from Hankou. July is the flood season of the Yangtze River, and the flood is constantly rising. Water level measurement personnel are guarding the water level scale day and night, recording and reporting to the flood prevention headquarters in a timely manner. In this opening section, the author first guides the audience to look at Wuchang on the opposite bank from Hankou. Only a faint shadow is seen, immersed in the gloomy weather. He concisely depicts the loyalty and diligence of the measurement personnel and the tense atmosphere, making people realize that this will be the prelude to a fierce struggle.
    The second section depicts: under the unprecedented sustained rainfall and the giant wind of level six or seven, the Danshui Pond was attacked by violent winds and waves and was in danger. The embankment body began to collapse, and the rescue team members went to the dangerous area to rush to plug the gap. The third section depicts the breach in 1931, which is now as solid as a rock. In these two sections, the author fully praises the heroic struggle of the rescue team members to repair the breach, and at the same time reminds people of the great flood disaster in Wuhan during the Kuomintang rule in 1931, forming a sharp contrast with the facts before our eyes today after liberation. In terms of plot arrangement, this section plays a role in connecting the next section, which praises the "human wall."
    The fourth section depicts that in a very tense situation, the flood prevention fighters displayed a high degree of revolutionary heroism and self-sacrifice spirit, bravely fighting the danger in the wind and rain. Many people jumped into the water and formed a "human wall" with their bodies to protect the embankment body. This is the most moving and thrilling scene, and also the most wonderful section of the entire scroll. In this section, the white waves are turbulent, the wind and rain are dim, and the situation is very bad and dangerous. The painter used extremely concise brushwork to summarize, concentrate, and prominently shape the heroic image of the "human wall" and their noble qualities. He also fully exerted the traditional expressive methods of emptiness and reality, setting off, and cropping in traditional Chinese painting.
    The fifth section is the home of the soldiers, depicting the flood prevention service team composed of students and other masses serving the flood prevention soldiers after the rain cleared (such as washing clothes, etc.). The sixth section is water transportation, depicting a large number of grass bags and other materials shipped from all over the country to support the dike repair. The seventh section is Daijiashan, the location of the first flood prevention command headquarters. In these three sections, the author depicts the flood prevention organizers and commanders and the extensive and enthusiastic support of the people. These, coupled with the heroic battles of the flood prevention fighters depicted earlier, clearly point out the basic reasons why we were able to overcome this great flood that has not been seen in a century. The pictures in these three sections have gradually shifted from the thrilling atmosphere to another relatively quiet world, so that the viewers not only get spiritual comfort, but more importantly, they deeply appreciate the greatness and correctness of the Communist Party and the infinite power of the Chinese people.
    In the eighth section, the author depicts the reinforcement project. The sections after this are all aftermath work. In order to eliminate hidden dangers in the embankment body, people are carrying out a large-scale pond filling project and have created a new method of soil extraction. There are motorcade patrols of the People's Liberation Army on the embankment. The ninth section is the drainage station. Countless water pumps drawn from all over the country are working hard to drain the accumulated water. Some workers are installing machines and transformers. At this time, the sky has cleared. The author only uses some light ocher colors to appropriately render the pleasant sunlight. This is not the author's leisure strokes in his busy schedule. This little bit of sunshine is the turning point of this scroll, that is, the turning point of this struggle.
    After that, the author's brushwork and ink interest became more fluent, and the color changed from dark to bright. In the tenth section, he depicts the farmers returning to their homes after the accumulated water was drained. The eleventh section depicts the so-called "water Great Wall" (wave-proof wooden rafts) from the "Jin Yintan" and "Gusao Tree" areas. On the slowly receding water, there are some grass piles flowing down from Dongting Lake.
    Finally, in the twelfth section, the farmers return victoriously from the flood prevention front line and immediately put themselves into production. On the boundless fertile land, the brilliant sun rises gradually from the east. The author indeed spent considerable effort in the section where the farmers immediately put themselves into production. In terms of the picture performance, there is no repetitive feeling with the tenth section where the farmers return to their homes. However, I think, considering the entire theme of Wuhan flood prevention, if the ending only depicts the farmers returning to their homes, only depicts the "water Great Wall" and the rising sun in the east, and omits the description of the farmers putting themselves into production, wouldn't it feel that there is more poetry and painting meaning left over?
    I can be said to be a layman when it comes to figure and landscape painting. In my opinion, this scroll is "pure" overall, but it cannot be said that there are no "minor flaws." For example, some of the images of the soldiers are not precise and detailed enough, appearing rough; the distant chickens and the nearby people are about the same size; the division of this section and that section is often separated by drawing a few large trees, with less variation; and so on. But these cannot obscure the completeness and success of this work. It is not accidental that such good works of traditional Chinese painting appear that reflect the struggle life and have brush and ink. I fully believe that with the leadership of the Party and the efforts of traditional Chinese painters, more and better moving works will continue to appear! (Attached picture)

    动人心目的“武汉防汛图”
    于非暗
    从我能够记忆时（清末）起，好像不曾有过鸿篇巨制、动人心目的国画创作出现。1911年后，古典绘画逐渐散落民间，钻研和发展民族绘画的传统，比前已大有进步，但是画家深入生活或是经过写生的大作品，却仍有限。建国以来，由于党的文艺方针的正确和对于民族绘画的重视与关怀，在国画创作方面，就一年比一年进步，一年比一年提高，出现了很多优秀的作品。这次第二届全国国画展览，作品就比第一届的更多更好，其中“武汉防汛图”卷，我认为就是近几十年来罕见的鸿篇巨制动人心目的作品。这卷画，是我有生以来所见的动人的现代作品之一。
    “武汉防汛图”作者黎雄才，用长约八丈、高不到一尺的长卷形式画成了这幅画。有人说，作者的笔墨技法是岭南派的；也有人说他还受西蜀画家的影响。我对作者不熟识，只是就画谈画，可能谈得有很多错误，要请读者和作者指教。
    从作者在这幅画的题跋中，我们可以大致了解他的创作经过：1954年秋天，武汉江水高涨，超过1931年最高水位，为百年来所未有。参加防汛斗争的有二十八万九千余人。从斗争开始到胜利结束，经历了一百天，在党的领导下和全国人民的支援下，创造了历史的奇迹。作者当时也亲历了这一斗争，并深受感动，因此作武汉防汛图卷以纪其事。这幅画是作者于1954年9月在张公堤上速写，1956年创作完成的。从这里，我们不难看出，这幅画的所以成功，首先是由于作者对这一生动事迹有极深的感受，同时在实际的斗争生活中搜集和积累了丰富的素材。至于如何处理、安排和表达这一题材，又直接关系到作者的艺术修养问题。我们看到作者采用的是长卷这一民族形式，我们还要看他在表现手法上怎样的突出主题，怎样的引人入胜，怎样的折转和归结，并且怎样的由头到尾，通体贯串、照应和关联，都是煞费苦心的事。
    “武汉防汛图”的内容，有十二段。第一段描写的是：雨云笼罩的夏天，从汉口望武昌黄鹤楼一带。七月是长江汛期，洪水不断上涨，水情测量人员日夜守候在水位标尺旁，及时记录，报送防汛指挥部。作者在开头这一段里，首先引导观众由汉口望对岸的武昌，只见一片淡影，浸淫在阴沉的天气中，简括地描绘出测量人员的忠勤职守和紧张的空气，使人意味到这将是一场激烈的斗争的前奏。
    第二段描绘的是：在空前持久的雨势和六、七级的巨风下，丹水池被狂风巨浪袭击出险，堤身开始崩塌，抢险队员们齐上险地，抢堵缺口。第三段描绘的是1931年的缺口处，这里现在安如磐石。这两段，作者全力来歌颂抢险队员修复缺口的英勇搏斗，同时使人记起1931年国民党统治时期的武汉大水灾，和解放后今天眼前的事实形成鲜明的对比。这一段，在情节安排上，为下一段歌颂“人墙”起了承接的作用。
    第四段是描绘在万分紧张的情况下，防汛战士们发挥了高度的革命英雄主义和自我牺牲的精神，在风雨中奋勇抢险，许多人跳下水去，用自己的身体结成“人墙”保护着堤身。这是最使人感动、最惊心动魄的大场面，也是全卷最精彩的一段描写。这一段，白浪滔天，风雨如晦，形势十分恶劣惊险。画家用极其精练的笔法，概括、集中和突出地塑造出作为“人墙”的英雄形象和他们的崇高品质。也充分发挥了国画中虚实、烘托和剪裁等传统的表现方法。
    第五段是战士之家，画着雨过天晴之后，有学生等群众组成的防汛服务队来为防汛战士服务（如洗衣裳等）。第六段是水上运输，画着从全国各地运来支援修堤的大批草包等物资。第七段是戴家山，防汛第一指挥部所在地。作者在这三段中描绘了防汛的组织指挥者和人民群众的广泛热烈的支援。这些，加上前面所描绘的防汛战士们的英勇的战斗，就显明地指出了这次百年来未有的大汛之所以能被我们战胜的基本原因。这三段的画面，已逐渐从惊险的气氛转到另一比较安静的天地，使看的人，不仅得到了精神上的安慰，更重要的是：使观众深切地体会到共产党的伟大和正确，体会到中国人民的无穷力量。
    作者在第八段里描绘的是加固工程，从这以后的几段，都是善后工作了。为了消灭堤身隐患，人们正展开大规模的填塘工程，并创造了采土的新方法，堤上有人民解放军摩托部队在巡逻。第九段是排水站，从全国各地抽调来无数的抽水机，正紧张地排除积水，有些工人在安装机器和变压器。这时的天空已经晴朗，作者仅仅使用一些浅淡的赭石颜色，就恰当地渲染出令人愉快的太阳光影，这不是作者在百忙之中着此一些闲笔，这点点阳光，是这卷画的转捩点，也即是这场斗争的转捩点。
    以后，作者的笔情墨趣更酣畅了，色彩由阴暗而转为鲜明了。他在第十段描绘了排除积水后，农民们重返家园。第十一段描绘了从“金银滩”、“姑嫂树”一带望所谓“水上长城”（防浪木排），慢慢下退的水上，有由洞庭湖流下来的一些草堆。
    最后，第十二段，农民们从防汛前线胜利回家，又立即投入了生产，在一望无际的肥沃土地上，光辉的旭日，从东方渐渐升起来了。作者在农民立即投入生产这一段中确实花费了相当大的精力，在画面表现上，和第十段农民重返家园并无重复的感觉。不过，我想，从整个武汉防汛这一题材着想，假如结尾只画农民重返家园，只画“水上长城”和东升的旭日就完了，而省略农民投入生产这一描写，岂不更觉诗情画意有余不尽吗？
    我对于人物山水画，可以说是个门外汉。这卷画在我看来，“大纯”之中，也还不能说没有“小疵”。例如：战士的形象，有些还不够精确细致，显得粗糙；远的鸡和近的人大小差不多；这一段和那一段的划分，往往都是画几棵大树来隔开，变化较少；等等。但是这些都不能湮没这一作品的完整、成功。国画中出现反映斗争生活、有笔有墨、像这样好的作品，并不是偶然的。我完全相信：国画创作在党的领导和国画家的努力下，将会有更多更好动人心目的作品继续出现！（附图片）
