The Adventurers' "Grief" and "Shock"

	Just as the Polish working people and all righteous people around the world are united in angrily condemning the instigators of the Poznań events, American official figures have also come out to speak. They are doing their utmost to put on a hypocritical, compassionate face, expressing "grief" and "shock." The U.S. State Department hastily issued a statement, openly encouraging subversive activities, and the U.S. House of Representatives even passed a proposal to bring the so-called Polish situation to the United Nations. However, the imperialists' hypocritical attitude and shameless interference in Poland's internal affairs have more thoroughly and completely exposed to the world that they are the masterminds behind this provocative incident. Otherwise, why would they be so "concerned" and gloating?

	As everyone knows, the Polish government and people are working hard to carry out huge reforms, solve new economic tasks, in order to expand socialist democracy and better meet the material needs of the working people. The imperialist forces do not like these facts, and they are frightened. Therefore, like a cornered dog jumping over a wall, they create provocative incidents, dreaming of achieving goals they cannot achieve.

	But these adventurers' conspiracy is doomed to failure. Indeed, how can they not fail? It is impossible to drag people who have chosen the socialist system back from the path they have taken. Let these adventurers "grieve" and be "shocked" in the face of their own failure. The Polish people will continue to advance along the path they have chosen.

    冒险家的“悲痛”和“震惊”
    正当波兰劳动人民和全世界正义人类对波兹南事件的煽动者同声愤怒谴责的时候，美国的官方人物也出来说话了。他们极力装出一副悲天悯人的面孔，表示“悲痛”和“震惊”。美国国务院迫不及待地发表声明，公然鼓励颠覆活动，而美国众议院甚至通过了一项提案，要向联合国提出所谓波兰局势问题。不过，帝国主义者这种伪善的态度和对波兰内政的无耻干涉，倒是更彻底无遗地向全世界暴露了：他们就是这次挑衅事件的幕后操纵人。要不然他们又为什么会这样“关心”和幸灾乐祸呢？
    大家知道，波兰政府和人民正在努力进行巨大的改革，解决新的经济任务，以便扩大社会主义民主和更好地满足劳动人民的物质生活需要。帝国主义势力不喜欢这些事实，他们害怕起来了。于是乎狗急跳墙，制造挑衅事件，梦想来达到他们所不能达到的目的。
    但是冒险家们的这种阴谋是失败了。的确，他们又怎能不失败呢？要想把选择了社会主义制度的人民从自己所走的道路上拖回来，这是办不到的。让这些冒险家们在自己的失败面前“悲痛”和“震惊”吧，波兰人民还是照样沿着自己选择的道路前进着。
