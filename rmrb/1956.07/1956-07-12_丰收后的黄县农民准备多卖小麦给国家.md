    Xinhua News Agency dispatch: Huang County in Shandong Province has had a bumper wheat harvest this year. Farmers are preparing to sell more wheat to the state, while also retaining significantly more wheat for their own use than in previous years. The Finance and Grain Department of the Huang County People's Committee estimates that the total amount of wheat purchased in the county this year may reach over 47 million catties, 64% more than last year.
    According to a recent survey by the Huang County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, except for a few agricultural cooperatives whose members will still sell surplus grain according to the "three fix" figures, most cooperative members are preparing to sell 15% to 20% more wheat to the state than the "three fix" figures.
    Due to the conscientious implementation of the principle of deducting less and awarding more, the wheat distributed to cooperative members in various agricultural cooperatives has generally increased by about 50% compared to last year. Many cooperative members with strong labor forces have received an average of more than 200 catties of wheat per person for their entire family. Therefore, they plan to sell more.
    Huang County has a population of 430,000 and only 710,000 mu of cultivated land. Before liberation, the county could not produce enough grain for its own needs. In the past few years, agricultural production has flourished throughout the county, not only changing the situation of not being self-sufficient, but also becoming the county that provides the most commodity grain in the entire Jiaodong Peninsula.

    丰收后的黄县农民准备多卖小麦给国家
    据新华社讯　小麦丰收了的山东黄县，今年农民准备卖给国家的小麦增多，自己留用的小麦也大大超过了往年。黄县人民委员会财粮部门预计：今年全县收购小麦可能达四千七百多万斤，比去年多64％。
    据中共黄县委员会最近调查，除个别农业社社员仍将按照“三定”数字出售余粮外，大多数社的社员准备卖给国家的小麦都比“三定”数字多15％到20％。
    由于认真贯彻执行少扣多分的原则，各农业社分给社员的小麦一般都比去年增加了50％左右。很多劳动力较强的社员分到的小麦，全家大小平均每人二百多斤。因而他们打算多卖。
    黄县全县人口四十三万，耕地面积只有七十一万亩。解放前这个县粮食不能自足。几年来全县农业生产蓬勃发展，不仅改变了不能自足的状况，并且一跃而为整个胶东半岛提供商品粮最多的县份了。
