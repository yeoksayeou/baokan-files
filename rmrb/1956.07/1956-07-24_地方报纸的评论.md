    Local Newspaper Reviews
    Overcoming Current Construction Difficulties
    On July 14th, the Heilongjiang Daily published an editorial entitled "Full Support for Industrial Construction." The editorial stated that Heilongjiang Province is currently encountering a series of difficulties in construction, such as a shortage of labor, a lack of transportation, a severe shortage of steel and cement, and delays in the processing of non-standard equipment, which are affecting project progress.

    The editorial pointed out that overcoming these difficulties is possible. For example, based on a rather conservative estimate of the existing cultivated land area and labor force in Heilongjiang Province's rural areas, it is possible to appropriately transfer a portion of the labor force from rural areas to meet the needs of industrial construction; the shortage of animal-drawn carts for transportation in basic construction can be resolved by appropriately drawing them from agricultural producers' cooperatives near urban areas; local state-owned enterprises have great potential, and this year the factories and mines under key construction in Heilongjiang Province also have the capacity to undertake the manufacture of non-standard equipment and guarantee on-time delivery; although the severe shortage of steel and cement is a prominent problem in current industrial construction, in addition to quickly and widely adopting alternative materials that have been successfully tested and saving as much cement as possible, the needs of industrial construction can also be met by distinguishing between priorities and concentrating the limited amount of materials on key projects.

    The editorial said that the current problem lies in the incorrect thinking of some leading comrades in relevant departments. After the upsurge of the socialist revolution in rural areas, some comrades mistakenly pitted support for increased agricultural production against support for industrial construction; they were unwilling to transfer labor and animal-drawn carts from rural areas, using the excuse that "agricultural production is too strained and the potential of rural areas has been exhausted." After opposing right-leaning conservative thinking, some comrades mistakenly believed that from then on they could carry out large-scale construction indiscriminately, regardless of conditions and possibilities, and without distinguishing between priorities, placing secondary projects on an equal footing with key projects. On the issue of steel and cement, many key projects are stalled awaiting materials, while some civil engineering projects are unwilling to lend any.

    The editorial finally demanded that, in order to quickly overcome the current difficulties in construction, it is necessary to correct the erroneous thinking of focusing only on agriculture and neglecting industry, and of focusing only on general projects and neglecting key projects, to vigorously support industrial construction from all aspects, and to ensure that key projects are constructed according to plan.
    Improving the Living Conditions of Employees in Newly Joint State-Private Factories
    The Wuhan "Changjiang Daily" published an editorial on the 19th, calling on newly established joint state-private factories to actively find ways to improve the living conditions of their employees. The editorial pointed out that among the factories in Wuhan that were newly approved for joint state-private operation this year, some factories and the specialized companies that lead them only care about workers completing their plans and do not care about workers' lives. When workers' enthusiasm for production is affected as a result, they do not examine the reasons from this perspective, but instead blame the workers for being lax in their labor discipline.

    The editorial said: The living problems of employees in new joint state-private factories are more numerous than those in state-owned enterprises and older joint ventures. We cannot solve all of these problems in a short period of time, but we should take a proactive approach to gradually solve them according to needs and possibilities. Some people think that "no movement for half a year" means that everything remains unchanged, ignoring some problems among employees that must be solved and can be solved; others want to postpone everything until after the economic restructuring, and these ideas are wrong.

    The editorial said that after enterprise joint ventures, the living conditions of employees should gradually improve compared to before the joint ventures, and should not be reduced. However, the leaders of some enterprises not only do not try to improve the lives of workers, but also cancel some of the original benefits. The editorial said: Unreasonable outdated rules and regulations should be gradually reformed, but which ones should be abolished, which ones can be retained, and what kind of new system should be used to replace the old system, must be carefully studied and implemented only after being approved by a certain leading body. It is wrong to simply abolish the old system without considering the specific circumstances.

    The editorial finally called on each specialized company and joint state-private factory to investigate and study the current problems in the lives of employees, distinguish between priorities, and take effective measures to gradually solve them.

    地方报纸的评论
    克服当前施工中的困难
    七月十四日黑龙江日报以“全力支援工业建设”为题发表了社论。社论说，黑龙江省当前施工中遇到了劳动力缺少、运输工具不足、钢材水泥奇缺、非标准设备加工拖期等一系列困难，影响着工程进度。
    社论指出，克服这些困难是有条件的。例如，根据黑龙江省农村现有耕地面积和劳动力的较保守的估算，是可以从农村适当调出一部分劳动力，来满足工业建设需要的；基本建设运输中缺少的畜力大车，只要从城市附近县份的农业生产合作社里适当抽调一下就可解决；地方国营企业的潜力很大，今年各重点建设的厂矿在黑龙江省加工的非标准设备，也是有能力承制和保证按期交货的；钢材和水泥奇缺虽然是目前工业建设中的突出的问题，但是除了迅速地广泛地采用已经鉴定成功的代用材料，尽可能地节约水泥使用量外，只要分清轻重缓急，把数量有限的材料集中用到重点工程上去，也能够满足工业建设的需要。
    社论说，目前问题就在于有关部门的领导同志有一些不正确的思想。有些同志在农村掀起社会主义革命高潮以后，错误地把支援农业增产和支援工业建设对立起来；以“农业生产过于紧张，农村潜力已经挖光”为理由，不愿意往外抽调劳动力和畜力大车。有些同志在反对右倾保守思想以后，以为从此可以不分条件和可能，可以不分轻重，一律进行大规模建设，错误地把次要工程摆在重点工程同等的地位。在钢材和水泥问题上，许多重点工程在停工待料，有些民用工程却不愿意借用。
    社论最后要求，为了迅速克服当前建设中的困难，必须纠正只顾农业放松工业和只顾一般放松重点的错误思想，从各方面大力支援工业建设，保证重点工程按计划施工。改善新合营厂的职工生活
    武汉“长江日报”十九日发表社论，要求新实行公私合营的工厂积极想办法改善职工的生活。社论指出，在武汉市今年新批准实行公私合营的工厂中间，有些工厂和领导它的专业公司，只顾要工人完成计划，不管工人生活。当工人生产情绪因此受到影响的时候，他们不从这方面去检查原因，却责备工人劳动纪律松弛。
    社论说：新公私合营工厂中职工的生活问题，比国营企业和老合营企业要多。对这些问题，我们不可能在一个短时期内全部解决，但是应该根据需要和可能，采取积极态度逐步地去解决。有些人认为
  “半年不动”，就是什么都原封不动，眼看职工中有些必须解决而又可以解决的问题，也置之不理；有的人则想什么事都拖到经济改组以后再去处理，这些想法都是错误的。
    社论说，企业合营以后，职工生活应该比合营以前逐步改善，而不能降低。但是有些企业的领导不但不设法改善工人生活，反而取消了一些原有的福利。社论说：不合理的陈规旧套，是应该逐步改革的，但是，哪些应该取消，哪些可以保留，应该用什么样的新制度去代替旧制度，都必须经过慎重研究，经过一定的领导机关批准以后才能实行，那种不根据具体情况，简单地把旧制度一概废除的作法是不对的。
    社论最后要求每个专业公司和公私合营工厂调查研究当前职工生活中存在的问题，分别轻重缓急，采取有效措施，逐步加以解决。
