Xinhua News Agency News: The season for Salar farmers to harvest spring wheat has arrived, and the fields on the south bank of the Yellow River in Qinghai Province are a scene of bustling activity. Young members of the agricultural cooperatives are harvesting purple highland barley and golden wheat, while elderly members are watching over the threshing grounds, managing the turning and drying. People are driving livestock back and forth between the fields, transporting wheat bundles from the fields to the threshing grounds, and seeds and fertilizers for summer planting from the villages to the fields. According to estimates from areas already harvested, this year's spring wheat production for Salar farmers is expected to increase by more than 20% compared to last year, and the harvest is better than any previous year. The Solidarity Second Agricultural Cooperative, composed of more than 300 Salar farmer households on the banks of the Yellow River, has seen increased production of both highland barley and wheat, and the income of the members has increased compared to last year.

In order to advance summer planting, Salar farmers generally adopt the method of irrigating the wheat fields a few days before harvesting to maintain a certain level of moisture in the fields. As soon as the spring wheat is harvested, they can plow and plant late autumn crops such as buckwheat and millet on the same day.

More than 92% of the more than 30,000 Salar people in Qinghai Province who are engaged in agricultural production have joined agricultural production cooperatives. They live in the Xunhua Salar Autonomous County area on the south bank of the Yellow River. The climate here is warm, and the rainfall is abundant, making it the area with the highest spring wheat production in Qinghai Province.

    青海撒拉族农民92％入了社
    今年春麦要比去年增产两成
    新华社讯　撒拉族农民收割春麦的季节来到了，青海省黄河南岸的田野里呈现一片繁忙景象。农业社的年轻社员们收割着紫色的青稞和金黄色的小麦，老年社员在晒场上看场，经管翻晒。人们赶着牲畜在田间来来往往，把麦捆由地里运到晒场，又从村里把夏种用的种子和肥料运到地里。根据已经收割的地区估算，撒拉族农民今年的春麦产量要比去年增加两成多，比过去任何一年的收成都好。黄河边上由三百多户撒拉族农民组成的团结第二农业社，青稞、小麦都增产，社员们比去年增加了收入。
    为了提前夏种，撒拉族农民普遍采用收割前几天向麦田灌一次水的办法，使麦田保持一定湿度，只等春麦收割完，当天便可以翻耕和种上乔麦、谷子等晚秋作物。
    青海省的三万多撒拉族人民都从事农业生产，已有92％以上参加了农业生产合作社。他们聚居在黄河南岸的循化撒拉族自治县一带。这里气候温暖，雨量较多，是青海省春麦产量最高的地方。
