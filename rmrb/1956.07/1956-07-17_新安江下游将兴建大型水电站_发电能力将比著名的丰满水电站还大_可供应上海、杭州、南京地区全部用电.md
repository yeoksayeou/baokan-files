Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, 16th. The first large-scale hydropower station designed and surveyed by Chinese engineers and technicians will be built downstream of the Xin'an River in Zhejiang Province. As of the end of June, the preliminary design work for this power station has been basically completed. Various preparatory works for the power station are already underway; all construction work is expected to be completed in 1961.

The Xin'an River is a major tributary of the Qiantang River. The basin has abundant rainfall, with an average annual rainfall of 1,754 millimeters; the average annual flow of water is 370 cubic meters per second. From Tunxi City in Anhui Province to Tongguan Village in Chun'an County, Zhejiang Province, the natural drop reaches 100 meters, containing abundant natural hydropower resources.

The Xin'an River also has excellent conditions in terms of topography and geology. The entire basin is divided into two major basins and three sections of canyons. In the canyons, the rocks are hard and the riverbeds are narrow, making it possible to find more dam sites; the basins between the canyons are good reservoir sites.

In the autumn of 1952, Chinese hydropower, geology, hydrology and other engineering technicians and Soviet experts began detailed and meticulous surveys of the entire Xin'an River basin. They surveyed all the river sources and related mountains in the Xin'an River basin and finally determined the current dam site.

The construction of the Xin'an River Hydropower Station will adopt the world's most advanced overflow-type layout. When floods arrive, flood discharge will take place on top of the plant building. After completion, its generating capacity will be greater than that of China's famous Fengman Hydropower Station.

After the completion of this power station, it will supply all the electricity for the cities and villages in the Shanghai, Hangzhou, and Nanjing areas; in addition, it can also dam and store the floodwaters of the Xin'an River, freeing or reducing the downstream cities and farmland from flood disasters.

    新安江下游将兴建大型水电站
    发电能力将比著名的丰满水电站还大
    可供应上海、杭州、南京地区全部用电
    新华社杭州16日电　第一座由我国工程技术人员勘测设计的大型水力发电站，将在浙江省新安江下游兴建。到六月底为止，这座电站的初步设计工作已经基本完成。电站的各项准备工程，目前已经着手进行了；全部建筑工程预计在1961年完工。
    新安江是钱塘江的一大支流。流域内雨量充沛，平均年降雨量达一千七百五十四公厘；水流的平均年流量为三百七十秒立方公尺。自安徽省屯溪市至浙江省淳安县铜官村的一段，天然落差达一百公尺，蕴藏着丰富的天然水力资源。
    新安江在地形同地质方面，条件也很优越。全流域地形分成两大盆地和三段峡谷。在峡谷当中，岩石坚硬，河床狭窄，可以找到较多的拦河坝址；峡谷之间的盆地，是良好的水库地址。
    1952年秋天，我国的水力发电、地质、水文等工程技术人员和苏联专家，就开始对整个新安江流域进行了详尽、细致的勘测。他们查勘了新安江流域所有的河源和有关的山岳，最后确定了现在的坝址。
    新安江水电站的建筑，将采用目前世界上先进的溢流式的布置型式。洪水到来的时候，将在厂房的顶部泄洪。建成以后，它的发电能力将比我国著名的丰满水电站还要大。
    这个电站建成以后，将供应上海、杭州、南京地区的城市和乡村的全部用电；另外，还可以拦蓄新安江的洪水，使下游城市和农田，免除或减少洪水灾害。
