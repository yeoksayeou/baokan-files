Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, July 14th – TASS reports: The Soviet Foreign Ministry has sent a statement to twenty-four nations regarding Pan-European cooperation on the peaceful uses of atomic energy. The Soviet government believes the time is ripe for convening a conference of European countries to discuss the establishment of a regional Pan-European agency for the peaceful uses of atomic energy. This agency could be composed of the governments of all European nations willing to participate. The United States could also participate.

The statement was transmitted by the Soviet Foreign Ministry on July 12th through the embassies and legations in Moscow of Austria, Albania, Belgium, Bulgaria, the United Kingdom, Hungary, the German Democratic Republic, Greece, Denmark, Iceland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Romania, the Federal Republic of Germany, Finland, France, Czechoslovakia, Switzerland, Sweden, Yugoslavia, and the United States to the governments of those countries.

At the same time, the statement was also transmitted through the embassies in Moscow of China, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the Mongolian People's Republic and the Republic of Vietnam to the governments of those countries.

The Soviet government believes that the European conference on the peaceful uses of atomic energy could discuss the rights and powers of the Pan-European agency for the peaceful uses of atomic energy. The following issues could be included within its purview: research into the economic aspects of the peaceful uses of atomic energy, studying the possibilities of mutual coordination in the use of raw materials, providing technical assistance, exchanging information, providing technical and scientific consultations to other countries by those countries advanced in atomic energy, providing manpower support, discussing the issue of maintaining regular contact between existing international and national organizations in Europe for the peaceful uses of atomic energy, and any other suggestions from countries regarding the expansion of international cooperation in the peaceful uses of atomic energy.

The broad development of Pan-European cooperation in the peaceful uses of atomic energy would in no way exclude bilateral agreements in this area. On the contrary, such bilateral agreements would only contribute to the joint efforts and cooperation of countries in the peaceful uses of atomic energy, as long as such agreements are based on equality and are not attached with any political, economic, military or other conditions imposed by one party on another that do not conform to the principles of respecting national sovereignty and independence.

The statement first addressed the enormous potential that discoveries in atomic energy have brought to technological progress and the improvement of the material welfare of all peoples.

The statement said that further development of atomic energy and its practical application in science and technology require a corresponding production base and scientific and technological foundation, and necessitate the joint efforts of countries in organizing production and the peaceful uses of atomic energy.

Currently, the "Cold War" and distrust in international relations are becoming a thing of the past, thus creating more favorable conditions for atomic energy scientists, engineers, and other experts from various countries to devote themselves not to the military uses of atomic energy, but to its peaceful uses, for the benefit of mankind.

The Soviet government has consistently advocated the unconditional prohibition of atomic and hydrogen weapons, and advocated the complete use of atomic energy for peaceful purposes. Therefore, it is now taking necessary measures to do its utmost to develop international cooperation in the peaceful uses of atomic energy.

The Soviet government's starting point here is that international cooperation in this area should completely exclude the use of atomic materials provided under corresponding agreements for military purposes.

Cooperation in the peaceful uses of atomic energy can only be effective if all parties concerned enjoy equal rights, strictly respect national sovereignty, do not interfere in their internal affairs, and strictly abide by the lofty principles of the United Nations Charter. For such cooperation to be fruitful, it must be ensured that it does not cause harm to the security of these or those countries, and that the assistance provided will not be subject to any political or military demands.

The statement went on to say: The Soviet government believes that the possibilities for developing international cooperation in the peaceful uses of atomic energy have not yet been exhausted. For example, regional cooperation in this area can also be developed. At present, the broad public is paying more and more attention to the issue of European countries cooperating in the peaceful uses of atomic energy. The development of such cooperation among European countries would greatly strengthen trust between them and is in line with the common interests of European security.

In the present situation, with the exception of the United States, European countries have extremely favorable conditions for developing cooperation among European countries in the peaceful uses of atomic energy and providing appropriate assistance to other countries. For example, they have highly developed industries, skilled labor, well-trained scientific and engineering cadres, and the necessary resources. However, it must be pointed out that certain Western European countries have recently made certain efforts, attempting to take advantage of the legitimate desire of the people of all countries to develop international cooperation in the peaceful uses of atomic energy, to establish exclusive groups of certain countries in this area. Doing so cannot but hinder broad cooperation in this area on a Pan-European basis. The plan to establish the so-called European Atomic Energy Community, composed of six Western European countries, including France, Italy, and West Germany, provides for just such a group.

According to the draft for the establishment of the European Atomic Energy Community, formulated by the special committee between the governments of the aforementioned six countries, it is intended to give this organization the right to practically monopolize all fissile materials and the right to distribute such materials among the member states of this organization. The draft also proposes to give the leading organs of this organization such power that this agency can practically supervise the entire atomic industry of the participating countries and, to a large extent, the economic sectors related to it. In this way, the agency is practically given a supranational character.

It cannot be overlooked that, in the case of some Western European countries participating in exclusive military groups against other European countries, the establishment of such an agency would make the work of the European Atomic Energy Community subordinate to the strategic goals of these groups. Since the European Atomic Energy Community has such a nature, it certainly cannot be expected that its activities will be beneficial to those countries that do not have the possibility of arranging their own atomic energy production. This means that economically strong countries may use the European Atomic Energy Community to force other economically weaker countries to accept their conditions. There is no doubt that this can only deepen distrust between countries and create more difficulties on the road to establishing an effective European security system.

It must also be taken into account that the establishment of such an agency, with only one part of Germany participating, would further deepen the division of the two parts of Germany, making it more difficult to implement measures for the establishment of a unified, peaceful, and democratic Germany. The establishment of the European Atomic Energy Community will actually eliminate the various restrictions currently imposed on West Germany in the production of atomic energy. This will enable West German revanchist groups to organize the production of atomic weapons themselves, thereby posing a serious threat to peace in Europe.

The statement pointed out: The Soviet Union has consistently advocated broad international cooperation in the peaceful uses of atomic energy. It does not keep secret its achievements in the peaceful uses of atomic energy and is happy to introduce these achievements to all countries. The Soviet Union has provided many countries with effective assistance in developing research work in nuclear physics, the peaceful uses of atomic energy, the construction of atomic reactors, and the training of experts, etc.

In order to promote cooperation among scientists from various countries in theoretical and experimental research work in nuclear physics and to expand the possibilities of the peaceful uses of atomic energy, at the initiative of the Soviet Union, representatives of eleven Eurasian countries convened a meeting in Moscow in March 1956 and concluded an agreement on the establishment of an international scientific research organization called the "Joint Institute for Nuclear Research." According to the concluded agreement, the Soviet government transferred the Nuclear Research Institute, the Electrophysics Experimental Institute and all the valuable equipment belonging to them to the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research.

The agreement directly stipulates that other countries that are willing to participate in the work of the Institute in the future can become equal members of the Institute as long as they declare their agreement to the terms of the already concluded agreement and are decided upon by a majority of the member states of the Institute.

It can be seen that such a Joint Institute for Nuclear Research, which is open to participation by other countries, should become an important center for cooperation among scientists from various countries.

The Soviet Union also submitted a proposal to the Eleventh Session of the Economic Commission for Europe in April 1956 regarding the establishment of an agency for the peaceful uses of atomic energy within the scope of this organization for the meeting to consider. The starting point for proposing this proposal was that some countries, especially small countries, do not have the strength to independently solve the various complex problems related to the peaceful uses of atomic energy.

Broad cooperation in this area among all European countries can undoubtedly ensure that the production of atomic energy for peaceful applications is developed more quickly, greatly promoting the improvement of people's welfare.

The statement concluded by saying that the Soviet government believes that such cooperation among all European countries can greatly promote the achievement of an agreement on the prohibition of atomic and hydrogen weapons and the elimination of such weapons from the arsenals of all countries, which would ensure that all nuclear materials are used exclusively for peaceful purposes, for the advancement of science and technology, and for the benefit of mankind.

    苏联向二十四个国家发表声明
    建议全欧合作和平利用原子能
    新华社14日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联外交部送给二十四个国家的关于和平利用原子能方面的全欧合作的声明说，苏联政府认为召开欧洲国家会议来讨论关于建立区域性的全欧和平利用原子能机构的时机已经成熟。这一机构可以由各国政府组成，凡是愿意参加这一机构的欧洲国家都可以参加。美国也可以参加这一机构。
    这个声明是苏联外交部七月十二日通过奥地利、阿尔巴尼亚、比利时、保加利亚、英国、匈牙利、德意志民主共和国、希腊、丹麦、冰岛、意大利、卢森堡、荷兰、挪威、波兰、罗马尼亚、德意志联邦共和国、芬兰、法国、捷克斯洛伐克、瑞士、瑞典、南斯拉夫和美国驻莫斯科大使馆和公使馆转交给这些国家的政府的。
    同时，这个声明也通过了中国、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国、蒙古人民共和国和越南民主共和国驻莫斯科大使馆转达给这些国家的政府。
    苏联政府认为，在讨论和平利用原子能的欧洲国家会议上可以讨论全欧和平利用原子能机构的权利和权力的问题，可以把下列一些问题列入它的权限之内，例如，研究和平利用原子能的经济方面，研究在利用原料上互相配合的可能性，提供技术援助，交换情报，由原子能方面发达的国家向其他国家提供技术上和科学上的咨询，提供人力上的支援，讨论欧洲现有的国际性和全国性和平利用原子能组织之间保持经常联系的问题，和各国关于扩大和平利用原子能方面的国际合作的任何其它建议。
    在和平利用原子能方面全欧合作的广泛发展，决不排除在这一方面的双边协定。相反，这种双边协定只会有助于各国在和平利用原子能方面的共同努力和合作，只要这种协定是建立在平等的基础上和不附有一方强迫另一方接受的任何政治、经济、军事或其他不符合尊重国家主权和独立原则的条件。
    这项声明首先谈到原子能方面的发现给技术进步和提高各国人民物质福利带来的巨大可能性。
    声明说，原子能方面的进一步发展及其在科学和技术上的实际利用，要求有相应的生产基础和科学技术基础，需要各国在组织生产和和平利用原子能的事业中共同努力。
    目前，“冷战”和国际关系中的互不信任正在成为过去，因而创造出更加有利的条件，使各国原子能科学家、工程师和其他专家不致力于原子能的军事用途，而致力于它的和平用途，为人类造福。
    苏联政府一贯主张无条件禁止原子武器和氢武器，主张把原子能完全用于和平目的，因此现在采取必要措施来尽力在和平利用原子能方面发展国际合作。
    这里苏联政府的出发点是，在这方面的国际合作，应当完全排除把根据相应的协定所提供的原子材料用于军事目的。
    在和平利用原子能方面的合作，只有在下列情况下才能是有效的，即：一切有关方面享有平等权利，严格尊重国家的民族主权，不干涉它们的内政以及严格遵守联合国宪章的崇高原则。这种合作要有成果，就必须做到不给这些或那些国家的安全带来损害，并且所提供的援助将不受到任何政治的或军事性的要求的约束。
    声明接着说：苏联政府认为，在发展和平利用原子能方面的国际合作的可能性还远没有用尽。例如，还可以发展这方面的地区性的合作。现在广泛的公众越来越多地注意到欧洲国家在和平利用原子能方面实行合作的问题。欧洲国家间这种合作的发展，会大大加强它们之间的信任，并且是符合欧洲安全的共同利益的。
    在现在的情况下，除了美国，就数欧洲国家有极有利的条件来发展欧洲各国之间在和平利用原子能方面的合作以及给其他国家以适当的帮助。例如，它们有高度发达的工业，熟练的劳动力，受过良好训练的科学工程干部以及必要的资源。然而，不能不指出，最近某些西欧国家作出一定的努力，企图利用各国人民对和平利用原子能方面发展国际合作的合理愿望，在这一方面建立某些国家的排他性集团，这样做不能不妨碍在全欧的基础上进行这一方面的广泛合作。成立由法、意、西德等六个西欧国家组成的所谓欧洲原子能联营组织的计划所规定的正是这样一种集团。
    根据上述六国政府之间的专门委员会所制定的成立欧洲原子能联营组织的草案，打算使这一组织实际上有权垄断全部分裂物质，并且有权在这一组织的成员国中分配这种物质。这个草案还建议给予这个组织的领导机关以这样一种权力，使这一机构可以实际上监督这一机构参与国的全部原子工业以及在很大程度上监督与它有关的经济部门。这样一来，实际上就是赋予这一机构以超国家的性质。
    不能不注意到，在一些西欧国家参加反对其他欧洲国家的排他军事集团的情况下，这样一个机构的成立会使得欧洲原子联营组织的工作服从于这些集团的战略目的。欧洲原子联营机构既然具有这种性质，当然不能指望它的活动能够有利于那些没有可能自己安排原子能生产的国家。这就是说，在经济上强的国家有可能利用欧洲原子联营组织来强迫其他经济比较薄弱的国家接受它们的条件。毫无疑问，这只能加深各国之间的不信任，在建立有效的欧洲安全体系的道路上造成更多的困难。
    还必须考虑到，建立起这种只有德国一部分参加的机构，会使德国两部分的分裂更为加深，会使建立统一、和平、民主的德国的措施更加难于实行。欧洲原子联营的建立，实际上还将取消目前对西德所规定的生产原子能方面的各种限制。这样将会使西德复仇主义集团有可能自己组织生产原子武器，从而对欧洲的和平造成严重的威胁。
    声明指出：苏联一贯主张在和平利用原子能方面实行广泛的国际合作。它并不对自己在和平利用原子能方面所获得的成就保守秘密，并且乐意把这些成就介绍给一切国家。苏联在发展核子物理学的研究工作、和平利用原子能、建筑原子反应堆和培养专家等等方面，给予许多国家有效的帮助。
    为了各国科学家在核子物理学理论研究和实验研究工作中进行合作和扩大和平利用原子能的可能性，在苏联的倡议下，十一个欧亚国家的代表1956年3月在莫斯科召开了会议，缔结了一项关于成立一个定名为“联合核子研究所”的国际性科学研究组织的协定。根据缔结的协定，苏联政府把核子研究所、电子物理学实验所及其所属的全部珍贵装备移交给联合核子研究所。
    协定中直接规定，其他在将来愿意参加研究所工作的国家，只要宣布同意已经缔结的协定的条款，经研究所多数会员国决定就可以成为研究所的平等的成员。
    可见，这样一个任由其他国家参加的联合核子研究所应当成为各国科学家进行合作的重要中心。
    苏联还曾经在1956年4月向欧洲经济委员会第十一次会议提出一项关于在这个组织范围内建立一个和平利用原子能问题的机构的建议供会议审议。提出这项建议的出发点是，某些国家，特别是小国，没有力量独立解决同和平利用原子能有关的各项复杂问题。
    一切欧洲国家在这方面进行广泛的合作，无疑可以保证和平应用的原子能的生产得到更快的发展，大大促进人民福利的提高。
    声明最后说，苏联政府相信，全体欧洲国家这种合作可以大大促进达成禁止原子武器和氢武器的协议以及从各国军备中取消这一类武器，这也就保证了把所有核子材料专门用于和平目的，用于要求科学和技术的进步，用于造福人类。
