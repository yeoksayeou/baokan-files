Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing. Jiangsu Province transferred more than 2,600 textile workers and silk reeling workers in the first half of this year to work in newly built textile and silk reeling factories in Henan, Xinjiang, and other places.

These workers were drawn from textile factories in Wuxi, Changzhou, Nantong, Suzhou, Changshu, and other cities, and silk reeling factories in Wuxi City. Many of them are advanced producers.

Workers in textile and silk reeling factories in Jiangsu Province are actively learning techniques and promoting advanced operating methods in the textile and silk reeling industries. Their technical level and their ability to manage machines and spindles are gradually improving. For example, the number of spindles managed by fine yarn workers has generally increased from 400 to 600 or 800, and the number of ordinary looms managed by weaving workers has increased from two to three or four. Some factories have trained a group of new workers, making it possible to transfer some workers to support newly built factories in the interior.

    两千多名纺织、缫丝工人支援内地
    新华社南京电　江苏省今年上半年抽调了二千六百多名纺织工人和缫丝工人，到河南、新疆等地新建的纺织、缫丝工厂工作。
    这些工人是从无锡、常州、南通、苏州、常熟等市的纺织厂和无锡市的缫丝厂内抽调的，其中有很多人是先进生产者。
    江苏省各纺织、缫丝厂的工人，积极学习技术和推广纺织、缫丝业中的先进操作方法，技术水平和看台、看锭能力逐渐提高，如细纱工人的看锭能力一般由四百锭增加到六百锭、八百锭，织布工人挡普通布机的台数由二台增加到三台、四台，有些工厂训练了一批新工人，因此有可能抽出一部分工人去支援内地新建的工厂。
