Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, July 15th (Reporter Zhang Jiachi): Shanghai's 25,853 industrial enterprises that implemented joint state-private ownership in January of this year have undergone investigation and rectification in the first half of the year, and have been preliminarily reorganized in terms of production. Among them, 2,141 struggling enterprises and individual handicraft businesses without independent operating conditions have been absorbed and merged by larger factories; 637 have been determined to be independently operated enterprises. The remaining ten thousand-plus enterprises have been classified and grouped according to the principle of "same product, similar region" and are managed by 2,936 central factories.

The independent factories that have been determined are all enterprises with relatively unique products or well-known quality brands. Several household chemical factories that produce famous brands of toothpaste such as Jian'er Toothpaste, Gu Chi Ling, and Rulanxiang, have been designated as independent factories. They will continue to produce independently in order to promote their original good characteristics. The selected central factories are generally larger-scale, well-organized, and have stronger management capabilities; however, there are also small factories like Liangyou Watch Factory with only six employees, which have been designated as central factories due to their high-quality spring manufacturing technology, also managing five similar factories. The central factory and the factories it manages currently implement a method of unified management, decentralized production, and independent accounting of profits and losses, and will gradually merge production as needed in the future, or continue to retain the decentralized production method for a long time.

Determining central factories and independent factories is an extremely important measure for the steady reorganization of Shanghai's newly joint state-private industrial enterprises, and it is also an effective way for industrial specialized companies to lead and manage a large number of decentralized joint venture enterprises. In the past six months, due to the implementation of this type of grouped management, the enterprise's asset inventory work was completed smoothly, some necessary financial management systems were established, and the business management level and technical level of each enterprise were initially improved. Therefore, most enterprises are able to complete the production tasks entrusted by the state very well.

In April of this year, the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party discovered that there were too few central factories, and many of the groupings did not belong to the same industry or product, which resulted in the central factories managing too many enterprises, and also could not meet the state's requirements for leveraging the production potential of coastal industries. In the past two months, enterprises with improper divisions and groupings have been re-adjusted and regrouped, and a large number of central factories have been added. The government's eight industrial bureaus have also correspondingly increased the number of industrial specialized companies to fifty-eight. Now, the specialized companies have dispatched more than 3,100 public representatives to these joint venture enterprises; private personnel of central factories and grassroots enterprises are also being arranged and negotiated with business circles in accordance with the principle of "mostly unchanged, slightly adjusted." All grouped factories and enterprises will also establish a production management committee in the central factory. This new form of democratic management, jointly participated by representatives of both public and private sectors and responsible cadres of Party, Youth League, and trade union organizations, will fully leverage the operating enthusiasm of all joint venture enterprises and create favorable conditions for further transformation and reorganization of the enterprises.

    上海两万家公私合营工厂初步改组
    采取设立中心厂和独立厂的措施收到好效果
    新华社上海15日电　新华社记者张家炽报道：上海市今年一月份实行公私合营的25，853家工业企业，在上半年内经过调查、整顿，已经作了初步的生产改组。其中有2，141户困难企业和没有独立经营条件的个体手工业户，已经由较大的工厂吸并；有637户已经确定为独立经营的企业。其他一万多户企业，按照“产品相同、地区相近”的原则，进行了分类编组，规定由2，936个中心厂分别管理。
    已经确定的独立厂，都是产品比较特殊的，或品质牌号闻名的企业。像出产坚尔齿、固齿灵、留兰香等名牌牙膏的几家家用化工厂，都被确定为独立厂。它们都将继续独立生产，以发扬原有的优良特点。已经选定的中心厂，一般都是规模较大、组织健全、管理能力较强的企业；但是也有像良友钟表厂那样的只有六个从业人员的小厂，由于制造发条的技术高、质量好，也被确定为中心厂，兼管了五个同类的工厂。中心厂和它所管理的工厂，目前实行统一管理、分散生产、各计盈亏的办法，将来根据需要再逐步合并生产，或仍然长期保留分散生产的方式。
    确定中心厂和独立厂，是上海市新合营工业企业稳步地进行改组的一个极重要的措施，也是各工业专业公司对大量的分散的合营企业，进行领导管理的有效的方式。半年来，由于实行这种编组管理，顺利地完成了企业的清产核资工作，建立了一些必要的财务管理制度，初步提高了各企业的经营管理水平和技术水平。因此，大多数企业，能够很好地完成国家委托的生产任务。
    在今年四月间，中共上海市委，曾经发现中心厂太少，编组有很多不是属于同行业同产品的缺点，因而使中心厂带管的企业过多，同时也不能适应国家对发挥沿海工业生产潜力的要求。最近两个多月来，划分编组不当的企业，已经重新进行调整、分组，增添了大批中心厂。政府八个工业局也相应地把工业专业公司增加到五十八个。现在，各专业公司已经派出三千一百多个公方代表到这些合营企业中去；中心厂和基层企业的私方人员，也正在按照“大部不动，小部调整”的原则，和工商界进行协商安排。所有编组的工厂企业，还将在中心厂成立生产管理委员会。这种由公、私双方代表和党、团、工会组织的负责干部共同参加的新的民主管理形式，将充分发挥各合营企业的经营积极性，为企业进一步改造、改组，创造有利的条件。
