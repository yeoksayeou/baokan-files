Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 8th. The double-track railway project from Shenyang to Dalian has already had 300 kilometers restored and opened to traffic. Currently, bridge construction workers and track workers are continuing to build bridges and repair lines ahead. After the entire Shenyang-Dalian railway double track is restored and open to traffic, a large number of industrial products and well-known Northeast specialties - soybeans, timber, and apples - can be more conveniently transported to the interior of the motherland or to Dalian Port for shipment overseas.

The railway from Shenyang to Dalian is 398 kilometers long. The double track was built during the Japanese occupation of Northeast China. However, during the Liberation War, this double track was severely damaged by Chiang Kai-shek's army. With the rapid development of our country's construction cause, the volume of transportation has increased year by year, and the single-track railway from Shenyang to Dalian can no longer meet the current transportation needs. Therefore, the state decided to invest in the phased restoration of the double track of this railway.

    沈阳到大连铁路三百公里复线修复通车
    新华社沈阳8日电　从沈阳到大连的铁路复线工程，已经有三百公里修复通车。现在，架桥工人和线路工人正在继续向前架设桥梁、整修线路。沈（阳）——大（连）铁路复线全部修复通车以后，铁路沿线大量的工业品和东北著名特产——大豆、木材、苹果，可以更加便利地运向祖国内地或运往大连港口装船外运。
    沈阳到大连的铁路共长398公里，日寇统治东北时就修建了复线。但是，在解放战争时期，这条复线已经遭到了蒋介石军队严重破坏。随着我国建设事业迅速的发展，运输量逐年增加，沈阳到大连的铁路单线已经不能适应目前运输的需要。因此，国家决定投资来分段修复这条铁路的复线。
