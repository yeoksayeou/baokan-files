Xinhua News Agency, July 15th: The Central Committee of the China Democratic League held a memorial meeting today to commemorate the tenth anniversary of the martyrdom of Li Gongpu and Wen Yiduo, martyrs of the China Democratic League. Those present included Shen Junru, Chairman of the Central Committee of the China Democratic League, Vice-Chairmen Zhang Bojun, Luo Longji, and Gao Chongmin, Secretary-General Hu Yuzhi, members of the Central Committee in Beijing, members of the Beijing Municipal Committee, and family members of the martyrs Li Gongpu and Wen Yiduo, totaling more than seventy people.

    The memorial meeting was presided over by Gao Chongmin. Zhang Bojun, Wen Yiduo's son Wen Lihe, and Li Gongpu's wife Zhang Manjun spoke at the meeting.

    Zhang Bojun called on all members of the League to inherit the legacy of the martyrs and further improve the work of the China Democratic League.

    Wen Lihe said: "The people recognize my father as a poet, scholar, and soldier, and this is an accurate assessment." He said that his siblings have all become glorious Communist Party members under the example of their father. He assured the elders and comrades present on behalf of his entire family that they would devote themselves to the cause of socialism under the education of the Party, and be worthy of being Wen Yiduo's children.

    Zhang Manjun recalled the circumstances of Li Gongpu's martyrdom and several touching deeds from his lifetime. She cited facts to show that Mr. Gongpu was still running around the streets for the democratic movement until the very last minute before his death. She said that Mr. Gongpu deeply cared for young people and often spent all day and night in sincere and frank conversations to help a young person solve ideological problems.

    Shen Junru spoke at the end of the memorial meeting. He said that he had not planned to speak due to poor health, but this morning he was moved to tears by the memory of his comrades-in-arms and as if he saw his two friends, Li and Wen. He encouraged the comrades of the League to strengthen unity, work hard, and commemorate the martyrs with action.

    李公朴、闻一多殉难十周年
    民主同盟中央举行纪念会
    据新华社15日讯　中国民主同盟中央委员会今天举行民盟先烈李公朴、闻一多殉难十周年纪念会。到会的有民盟中央委员会主席沈钧儒，副主席章伯钧、罗隆基、高崇民，秘书长胡愈之和在京中央委员、北京市委员会委员及李公朴和闻一多烈士家属等共七十多人。
    纪念会由高崇民主持。章伯钧和闻一多的儿子闻立鹤、李公朴夫人张曼筠在会上讲了话。
    章伯钧在会上要求全盟同志继承先烈的遗志，更进一步地把民盟的工作做好。
    闻立鹤说：人民公认我的父亲是诗人、学者和战士，这是确切的评价。他说，他们弟兄姊妹在父亲的榜样之下都已作了光荣的共产党员。他代表全家向在座的长辈和同志们保证：一定要在党的教育下为社会主义事业而献身，无愧为闻一多的儿女。
    张曼筠回忆了李公朴在殉难时的情况和生前的几桩感人事迹。她举事实说明公朴先生在临难的前一分钟还在为民主运动奔走街头。她说，公朴先生深深爱护青年，常为帮助一个青年解决思想问题，诚恳坦白地与之作终日通宵的谈话。
    纪念会将结束时，沈钧儒讲了话。他说他因健康不佳，本不打算讲话，但今晨因怀念战友情殷，仿佛看见了李、闻二位朋友，不禁感动流泪。他勖勉盟的同志加强团结，努力工作，用行动来纪念先烈。
