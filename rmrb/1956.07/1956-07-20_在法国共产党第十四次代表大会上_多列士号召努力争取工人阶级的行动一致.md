Xinhua News Agency, Paris, 19th - According to TASS: At the 14th Congress of the French Communist Party on July 18th, the General Secretary of the French Communist Party, Maurice Thorez, made a report on the first item on the agenda, "Striving for Social Progress, Defending Peace, and Fighting for the National Dignity of France."

    Thorez said that although only two years have passed since the conclusion of the 13th Congress of the French Communist Party, tremendous changes have taken place in the international situation and within France.

    Thorez said that socialism has gone beyond the boundaries of a single country. The fact that socialist ideas are attracting millions of people in capitalist countries has developed completely new conditions for striving for the unity of the working class, for preventing war, and for winning the victory of socialism in places where socialism has not yet been established.

    Thorez continued that in France, the masses of people are launching struggles to win their vital interests and to strive for the national independence of France. There have been certain changes in French policies.

    Through its activities, the French Communist Party has made significant contributions to the victorious struggle of the working people to achieve these changes in French policies.

          The Economic and Political Situation in France

    Thorez then spoke of the economic and political situation in France. He said that the concentration of French capital is continuing to strengthen. Capitalist enterprises, which account for only 0.5% of French enterprises in terms of number, pay more than 48% of the wages to the French working class. The French economy is falling behind. Thorez cited the following figures: In 1929, France's steel production was 10 million tons, while in 1955, production only increased to 12.2 million tons. In 1913, France accounted for 8% of world industrial output, but now it accounts for only 3.6%.

    Thorez pointed out the problem of the impoverishment of the French working class and peasants. He said that taxes are getting higher and higher, and the capitalist monopolies' attacks on the working people are becoming more and more severe.

    Thorez said that the French Communist Party calls on all workers and all democratic forces to fight to change the situation in which France finds itself due to the representatives of monopoly capital and which is further deteriorated due to the policy of submitting to American monopolists.

          The Essence of the Algerian Question

    Thorez then pointed out the essence of the Algerian question. He emphasized that the colonialist groups' attempt to maintain the demand of "France's position in Algeria" is in fact promoting the loss of this position, because the Algerian war is widening the divisions between the Algerian people and the French people, and this war is not in line with national interests. Communists and socialists will continue to wage a common struggle in various ways to end military operations in Algeria. They will defend those newspapers that advocate peace, keeping them free from violation. They will strive for the release of democrats imprisoned in France and Algeria. They will give fraternal support to the demands of the Algerian working people in France, and will protect the rights of Islamic students in our universities.

    Thorez said that communists and socialists jointly oppose the colonialist attitude towards Algeria and other dependent countries, and advocate replacing the colonialist attitude with a new attitude, that is, with an attitude based on the principle of uniting according to the free will of the people themselves. Thorez emphasized that only by maintaining constant vigilance by all forces defending peace can the prevention of war be guaranteed. The recent good development of the French-Soviet talks has largely promoted the restoration of friendly relations between all major powers that bear the main responsibility for maintaining peace. Now the French working people and all peace advocates are expecting our leaders to take new actions, such as stopping the expansion of armaments and solving the European problem. The French Communist Party has always supported all efforts for peaceful cooperation and coexistence on an equal footing between countries with different social systems.

        The Question of France's Transition to Socialism

    Thorez spoke about the question of France's transition to socialism. He pointed out that the working peasants, intellectuals, and handicraftsmen of France, that is, the vast majority of the French people, can be united around the working class.

    Thorez said that in order to advance towards socialism, and in order to satisfy the urgent economic and political demands of the working people, the entire working class must act in unison. We should unite all the trade unions in France and strive for the unity of action between the Socialist Party and the Communist Party. In this regard, the French Communist Party faithfully abides by its own traditions, and the Socialist Party has also slightly changed its policies, adopting a program different from that of 1947, especially in foreign policy.

    However, the Socialist Party's organ, "Le Populaire de Paris," has conducted systematic attacks on the Communist Party, and the leaders of the Socialist Party continue to refuse to cooperate with the communists.

    When talking about the issue of the cult of personality, Thorez said that open and bold criticism of this issue is another vivid manifestation of the strength of the Soviet Communist Party and the vitality of the Soviet system. The French working people's confidence in the first socialist country in history has never wavered, and this confidence has been further strengthened due to the courage and lofty political qualities shown by our Soviet comrades in this regard. He pointed out the great importance of the resolution of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union "On Overcoming the Cult of Personality and Its Consequences." He emphasized that this resolution has received a wide response from the French Communist Party and the unanimous and enthusiastic support of the French working people.

                Party Issues

    Thorez then spoke of party issues. He said that after the 13th Congress, our party has become stronger. The 1955 provincial council elections affirmed the consolidation of its position as the largest party in France. The general election this year once again demonstrated the working people's trust in our party.

    The experience of the past two years has fully confirmed the thesis of the 13th Congress: there are some forces in our country that are necessary to change policies, and our task is to unite these forces.

    Thorez pointed out the shortcomings in the party's political activities. He called for overcoming the sectarian sentiments toward the working people in the Socialist Party, developing the number of party members, strengthening propaganda and mobilization work, expanding the circulation of party newspapers, and improving the educational work among young people and women. He also called for strengthening inner-party democracy and encouraging constructive criticism.

    Turning to the question of the international communist and workers' movement, Thorez called for strengthening international solidarity. He said that the recent visit of the French Communist Party delegation to Moscow to discuss a number of issues was conducted in a spirit of unreserved solidarity with the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. He expressed regret over the relations that had developed between the French Communist Party and the League of Communists of Yugoslavia due to errors and unjust accusations against the Yugoslav communists. Thorez emphasized the need for the parties of the two countries to send delegations to hold talks and restore their fraternal relations.

    Thorez finally called for efforts to make the Communist Party stronger! Striving to establish unity of action of the working class, uniting all democratic forces, in order to stop the war in Algeria, strive to ease international tensions, respect democratic freedoms, meet the demands of the working people, and strive to establish a unified people's front!

    Thorez's report was greeted with storms of applause. The delegates and guests sang the Internationale.

    在法国共产党第十四次代表大会上
    多列士号召努力争取工人阶级的行动一致
    新华社19日讯　据塔斯社巴黎讯：法国共产党总书记多列士在法国共产党第十四次代表大会七月十八日的会议上，就会议的第一项议程“争取社会进步、保卫和平和争取法国民族尊严”作了报告。
    多列士说，自从法国共产党第十三次代表大会闭幕以来虽然只有两年期间，但是国际局势和法国内部都发生了巨大的变化。
    多列士说，社会主义已经越出了单一国家的界限，在资本主义国家里社会主义思想吸引了千百万人民的这结果就为争取工人阶级的团结，为防止战争和为在还没有建立社会主义的地方争取社会主义的胜利发展了完全新的条件。
    多列士继续说，在法国，人民群众正在为争取他们的切身利益和为争取法国的民族独立而展开斗争。在法国政策方面已经有了某些改变。
    法国共产党通过它的活动对劳动人民争取法国政策中的这些改变的胜利斗争作了重大的贡献。
          法国经济和政治形势
    多列士接着谈到法国经济和政治形势。他说，法国资本的集中还在继续加强。以数目计仅占法国企业0.5％的资本主义企业就付给了法国工人阶级48％以上的工资。法国经济正在变得落后，多列士举出了下列数字：1929年法国的钢产量是一千万吨，而1955年的时候产量只增加到一千二百万吨。在1913年，法国占世界工业产量的8％，而现在它只占3.6％。
    多列士指出了法国工人阶级和农民贫困化的问题，他说，赋税越来越高，资本主义垄断资本对于劳动人民的进攻越来越厉害。
    多列士说，法国共产党号召全体工人和一切民主力量为改变垄断资本的代表使法国所处的并且由于屈从美国垄断资本家的政策而进一步恶化的情况而进行斗争。
          阿尔及利亚问题的本质
    多列士接着指出了阿尔及利亚问题的本质，他强调指出，殖民主义集团企图保持
  “法国在阿尔及利亚的地位”的要求事实上是促使这种地位的丧失，因为阿尔及利亚战争扩大了阿尔及利亚人民和法国人民之间的分歧，这个战争是不符合民族利益的。共产党人和社会党人将通过各种方式为结束在阿尔及利亚的军事行动而继续进行共同斗争。他们将维护那些主张和平的报纸，使它们不受侵犯。他们将争取释放在法国和阿尔及利亚被监禁的民主人士。他们将对在法国的阿尔及利亚劳动人民的要求给以兄弟般的支持，并且将保护我们大学里的伊斯兰教学生的权利。
    多列士说，共产党人和社会党人共同反对对阿尔及利亚和其他附属国家采取殖民主义态度，主张用新的态度，即用那种以根据人民自己的自由意志而联合的原则为基础的态度来代替殖民主义态度。多列士强调指出，只有一切维护和平的力量经常保持警惕才能保证防止战争。最近法—苏会谈的良好发展在很大程度上促进了对维护和平负有主要责任的一切大国间友好关系的恢复。现在法国劳动人民和所有和平拥护者正在期望我们的领导者采取新的行动，例如，停止扩充军备和解决欧洲问题。法国共产党始终支持为社会制度不同的国家之间在平等的基础上和平合作和共处所作的一切努力。
        法国向社会主义过渡问题
    多列士谈到了法国向社会主义过渡的问题，他指出，法国的劳动农民、知识分子和手工业者，即绝大多数的法国人民，是可以团结在工人阶级周围的。
    多列士说，为了向社会主义前进，为了满足劳动人民迫切的经济和政治要求，整个工人阶级必须一致行动。我们应当团结法国的所有工会，争取社会党和共产党的行动一致。在这方面，法国共产党忠实地遵守自己的传统，社会党也已经稍稍改变了自己的方针，采取了不同于1947年的纲领，特别是在外交政策方面。
    但是社会党机关报“巴黎人民报”对共产党进行了有系统的攻击，而且社会党的领袖们继续拒绝同共产党人合作。
    多列士在谈到个人崇拜问题时说，对这个问题进行公开的和大胆的批评是苏联共产党的力量和苏维埃制度的生命力的又一个生动的表现。法国劳动人民对历史上第一个社会主义国家的信心绝没有动摇，由于我们的苏联同志们在这方面所表现的勇气和崇高的政治品质，这种信心进一步加强了。他指出了苏联共产党中央委员会“关于克服个人崇拜及其后果”的决议的巨大重要性，他强调说，这项决议得到了法国共产党的广泛响应以及法国劳动人民一致和热烈的支持。
                党的问题
    多列士然后谈到党的问题，他说，在第十三次代表大会之后，我们的党变得更加强大了。1955年省议会的选举肯定了它作为法国第一大党的地位的巩固。在今年大选中再一次表明了劳动人民对我们的党的信任。
    过去两年的经验完全证实了第十三次代表大会的论点：在我们国家中存在着一些为改变政策所必需的力量，我们的任务就是团结这些力量。
    多列士指出了党的政治活动中的缺点，他要求克服对社会党劳动人民的宗派主义情绪，发展党员数量，加强宣传鼓动工作，扩大党报的销路和改进在青年和妇女中进行的教育工作。他还要求加强党内民主，鼓励建设性的批评。
    多列士在转而谈到国际共产主义和工人运动的问题的时候要求加强国际团结。他说，最近法国共产党代表团访问莫斯科讨论若干问题是本着同苏联共产党保持毫无保留的团结精神进行的。他对于由于错误和对南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟的不公正的指责而在法国共产党和南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟之间发展起来的关系表示遗憾。多列士着重指出两国的党有必要派遣代表团举行会谈，恢复它们的兄弟关系。
    多列士最后要求努力使共产党更加强大起来！努力建立工人阶级的行动一致，团结一切民主力量，以便制止阿尔及利亚的战争，争取缓和国际紧张局势，尊重民主自由权，满足劳动人民的要求，并且为建立统一的人民阵线而努力！
    多列士的报告博得暴风雨般的掌声。代表们和来宾们唱了国际歌。
