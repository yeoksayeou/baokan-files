How Wangcheng County Develops Hog Production
    Yao Huibin
Wangcheng County, Hunan Province, has achieved great success in pig farming. By the end of June 1955, the county had a total of 71,540 pigs, averaging about 0.75 pigs per household. By the end of May this year, the number of pigs in the county had increased to 140,298 (excluding the number of pigs raised in two towns and by government agencies), averaging 1.5 pigs per household, an increase of nearly 100% compared to the end of June last year. Due to the rapid development of hog production, the procurement of live pigs has been excellent, domestic sales are normal, and the foreign transfer tasks have been overfulfilled.

        Developing Pig Sources
    To greatly develop hog production, there must be enough piglets; to have enough piglets, there must be enough boars and sows. Wangcheng County first grasped this key link. They carefully calculated the county's pig source account, making the selection and retention of breeding pigs and local breeding of piglets the primary task of hog production. They formulated plans for monthly piglet breeding and the selection and retention of breeding pigs. In order to effectively develop pig sources, the county vigorously promoted double mating and re-mating, and stipulated that castration was prohibited during certain periods. All boars and sows with reproductive capacity were retained for breeding purposes. This increased the breeding rate and the number of piglets rapidly. There was sufficient pig source for fattening pigs and guaranteeing the selection of high-quality breeding pigs. By the end of April this year, the number of breeding sows in the county had increased eightfold compared to the end of June last year, and the number of breeding boars had increased more than eightfold compared to the end of June last year. Therefore, after April, there was no longer a need to universally retain newborn piglets for breeding purposes, and the selected boars and sows could also be rectified to eliminate the weak and retain the strong. In order to stabilize piglet prices and protect the reasonable profits of sow breeders, Wangcheng County also stipulated standard prices for ordinary piglets, ensuring the interests of both buyers and sellers of piglets.

        Reserving Feed
    Effectively solving the feed problem is a crucial key to greatly developing hog production. Wangcheng County's main method of solving the green fodder problem is to make full use of dry land and ponds to grow feed crops. In cooperatives, tasks are assigned to agricultural production teams according to needs, using fixed quotas, quantitative methods, and contracted production. Women and children, who are semi-laborers, are mobilized to collect wild feed. Many agricultural cooperatives have set aside a certain amount of land as a hog feed base. At the same time, more than 250 kilograms of water hyacinth were transported back from Guangzhou for key breeding and promotion.
    In last year's "Three Fixes" campaign, Wangcheng County also gave appropriate consideration to feed grain for pig farming. Before the "Three Fixes," there were more than 3,700 sows in the county. After the "Three Fixes" ended, the number increased to more than 9,200. Local departments concerned also paid more attention to the operation of feed. There were many varieties of refined feed, including mixed bran, Grade A fine bran, coarse bran, bran cake, broken rice, and bran dregs. The quantity was also sufficient, and the supply was timely, which was very popular among farmers.

          Public or Private Rearing
    In the process of developing hog production in Wangcheng County, the leadership encountered the question of whether public or private rearing should be the main focus. Initially, they adopted the policy of "relying on agricultural cooperatives for public rearing, while also taking into account private rearing by members." In early April, the responsible comrades of the County Party Committee and the County Animal Husbandry Bureau inspected the pig farming situation in several agricultural cooperatives. They found that although collective rearing had achieved certain results, the management methods were still very chaotic, with few being well-managed and many being poorly managed. Newly established cooperatives also faced many difficulties in terms of funds, equipment, and technology. A considerable proportion of cooperative members still had empty pens. 27.2% of the total number of farm households in the county had the conditions for raising pigs but had not done so due to various difficulties. The County Party Committee believed that if the problem of empty pens was not resolved quickly, it would inevitably affect the realization of the county's hog production increase plan. Collective pig raising should be gradually expanded after the potential of private rearing by members has been tapped and the phenomenon of empty pens has been eliminated. Therefore, Wangcheng County's guidance on hog production was timely shifted to the policy of "focusing on developing private rearing by members while also developing collective pig raising in a planned manner." The slogan "Tap the potential of members and eliminate the phenomenon of empty pens" was put forward, and members were helped to solve the difficulties of funds, equipment, and lack of piglets. In this way, the number of empty pens was quickly reduced. From April to the first half of May, more than 17,000 empty pens were eliminated in the county, and 28 townships completely eliminated the phenomenon of empty pens.

          Reasonable Pricing of Manure
    Reasonable pricing of manure from pig farming by members and returning it to the cooperative is one of the important conditions for encouraging members to raise pigs. In Wangcheng County, the price of manure is generally a maximum of 0.3 yuan and a minimum of 0.2 yuan per dan (approximately 50 kg). Each pig can produce 40-50 dan of pure manure from small to large (about 150 kg), which can be valued at about 12 yuan, equivalent to the price of 200 kg of rice. One standard for calculating the price of manure is to compare pig manure with ammonium sulfate: pig manure contains 0.5% nitrogen, ammonium sulfate contains 20% nitrogen, and the nitrogen content of 40-50 dan of pig manure is approximately equal to the nitrogen content of 100 kg of ammonium sulfate. However, the labor required to apply pig manure is greater, and ammonium sulfate costs about 16 yuan per 100 kg. Therefore, a manure value of about 12 yuan per pig is relatively reasonable. (Editor's note: Whether this calculation method is reasonable remains to be studied. Wangcheng County's spirit of conducting in-depth and specific research on problems is very good.) Members are generally satisfied with this pricing.

          Timely Prevention and Control of Diseases
    Wangcheng County is a region where swine fever, swine erysipelas, and swine pleuropneumonia are relatively prevalent. Before March this year, the number of pigs dying from diseases every month was between 800 and 1,000. In order to eliminate this biggest obstacle to hog production, Wangcheng County carried out a large amount of work in training veterinarians and improving veterinary organizations. In April, 445 veterinarians were trained at one time. Together with the original veteran veterinarians, veterinary associations and groups were established by region. Due to the strengthening of epidemic prevention forces, as of early June, 50,000 pigs in the county had been vaccinated. Temporary shock teams were also organized to carry out shock treatment in epidemic areas. In addition, pigpens were continuously disinfected with lime water in April and May, so the disease was greatly reduced.

        Strengthening Leadership
    In order to strengthen the organization and leadership of hog production, systematic organizational structures were gradually established from the county to the cooperative at the beginning of this year. The county established a Hog Production Administration Bureau (now renamed the Animal Husbandry Bureau), each district established a Hog Production Management Section, and agricultural production cooperatives raising pigs collectively also established a Hog Production Section. Cadres of the County Animal Husbandry Bureau directly contacted the heads of hog production sections in each district and cooperative. In this way, the leadership was able to understand the situation in a timely manner and solve problems specifically.

    Local farmers have circulated the saying: "Don't be afraid of a poor family, just be afraid of not raising pigs," "No pigs in the pen, no grain in the field." The Party and government leading cadres of Wangcheng County deeply realized the farmers' demand for raising pigs and the importance of developing pig farming for increasing production and increasing income. They regarded the development of pig farming as a major event in the county's upsurge in agricultural and sideline production. In early February, the responsible comrade of the County Party Committee personally went to Xitang Agricultural Cooperative in Gushan District to understand the problems of hog production. He then convened a symposium of cooperative cadres from 69 cooperatives to discuss pig farming issues, analyze the county's pig sources, the demands of the masses, and pig farming habits, and study ways to solve the problems of pig sources, feed, and pig houses. In the process of implementation, the responsible comrades of the County Party Committee and the Animal Husbandry Bureau went to various cooperatives in a timely manner to conduct inspections and summaries. This is an important reason why Wangcheng County's hog production has been able to develop rapidly.

    望城县怎样发展生猪生产
    姚会宾
    湖南省望城县养猪很有成绩，1955年6月底，全县共养猪71，540头，平均每户约0.75头。到今年5月底，全县的猪增加到140，298头（尚缺两个镇及机关团体养猪数），平均每户养1.5头，比去年六月底养猪数增加近一倍。由于生猪生产发展较快，因而生猪收购情况很好，内销供应正常，外调任务也超额完成。
        发展猪源
    要大量发展生猪生产，就要有足够的小猪；要有充足的小猪，就必须有足够的公、母猪。望城县首先就抓住了这一环。他们仔细算了全县的猪源账，把选留种猪、就地繁殖小猪，作为生猪生产的首要工作。拟订了分月繁殖小猪和选留种猪的计划。为了有效地发展猪源，全县大力推行双重配种和复配，并且规定在一定的时期内禁止阉割，凡是有生殖能力的公、母猪都留作繁殖用。这样繁殖率提高，小猪增加很快，肉用肥猪有了充足的猪源，选留优良种猪也有了保证。到今年四月底，全县种母猪数比去年六月底增加了八倍，种公猪比去年六月底增加八倍多。因此，在四月以后新生的小猪，已经不需要再普遍留作繁殖用，选留的公、母猪也可以进行整顿，去弱留强了。为了稳定小猪价格和保护母猪饲养户的合理利润，望城县还规定普通小猪的标准价格，使买卖小猪双方的利益都有了保障。
        贮备饲料
    切实解决饲料问题，是大量发展生猪生产的一个重要关键。望城县解决青饲料的主要办法是充分利用旱地水塘种植饲料作物，在合作社里按照需要，采用定额定量、包产包工办法，分配任务给农业生产队，并发动妇女小孩半劳动力采集野生饲料。许多农业社都留出了一定的土地作生猪饲料基地。同时还从广州运回水浮莲二百五十多斤，重点繁殖推广。
    望城县去年“三定”中对养猪的饲料粮也有适当的照顾，“三定”前全县有三千七百多头母猪，“三定”结束即增至九千二百多头。当地有关部门对饲料的经营也比较重视，精饲料的品种较多，有混合糠、甲细糠、粗糠、糠饼、碎米、糠糟等，数量也较充足，供应及时，很受农民欢迎。
          公养还是私养
    望城县发展生猪生产的过程中，在领导思想上曾经遇到公养私养究竟以何者为主的问题。他们最初是采取“依靠农业社公养，兼顾社员私养”的方针。四月初县委和县畜牧局负责同志到几个农业社检查了养猪情况，发现集体饲养虽有一定成绩，但经营管理方法还很混乱，养得好的少，养得不好的多。新建的社在资金、设备、技术等方面的困难也很多。社员中的空栏户还占有相当的比重。全县有条件饲养因有不同困难而未养猪的占全县总农户的27.2％。县委认为空栏户的问题如不迅速解决，势必影响全县生猪增产计划的实现，集体养猪应当在发掘了社员私养潜力、消除了空栏现象的基础上再行逐步扩大。因此望城县对生猪生产的指导又及时地转为“着重发展社员私养，同时有计划的发展集体养猪”的方针，提出“挖掘社员潜力，消除空栏现象”的口号，并帮助社员解决资金、设备和缺乏小猪的困难。这样，空栏户很快就减少了。从四月份到五月上半月，全县即消除空栏户一万七千多户，完全消除了空栏现象的乡有二十八个。
          粪肥合理作价
    社员养猪的粪肥合理作价归社，是鼓励社员养猪的重要条件之一。望城县的粪价一般每担最高三角，最低二角，每头猪从小到大（一百五十斤左右）可出纯粪四十—五十担，约可折价十二元左右，相当于二百斤稻谷的价钱。他们折算粪肥价格的一个标准是以猪粪和硫铵比较：猪粪含氮量为0.5％，硫铵含氮量为20％，40—50担猪粪的含氮量约等于100斤硫铵的含氮量，但施猪粪所需的人工较多，硫铵每百斤十六元左右，因此一头猪的粪值十二元左右也是比较合理的。（编者按：这种折算办法是否合理，尚待研究。望城县这种深入具体研究问题的精神，是很好的。）对这样的作价社员一般感到满意。
          及时防治病疫
    望城县是猪瘟、猪丹毒和猪肺疫比较流行的地区。今年三月以前每月死于病疫的猪都在八百头至一千头左右。为了消除生猪生产中的这个最大阻碍，望城县进行了大量训练兽医和健全兽医组织的工作。四月份一次即训练兽医445人，连同原有老兽医按区建立了兽医分会和小组。由于防疫力量加强，全县至六月上旬已有五万头猪进行了预防注射，还组织了临时突击队对疫情地区进行了突击治疗，加以四、五两月连续进行对猪栏用石灰水消毒，因而病疫大大减少。
        加强领导
    为了加强对生猪生产的组织领导，今年年初从县到社逐步建立了系统的组织机构，县成立生猪生产管理局（现改名畜牧局），各区成立生猪生产管理股，集体养猪的农业生产合作社也设立生猪生产股，县畜牧局干部则分片与各区各社生猪股长直接进行联系。这样，使领导上能够了解情况及时，解决问题具体。
    当地农民流传着这样的说法：“不怕家不富，只怕不养猪”，“栏内没有猪，田中不出谷”。望城县党政领导干部深切地体会到农民的养猪要求和发展养猪对增加生产增加收入的重要性，他们把发展养猪事业视为全县农副业增产高潮中的一件大事。县委负责同志于二月初亲自到谷山区西塘农业社了解了生猪生产问题，随即召集了六十九个社的社干部座谈养猪问题，研究分析了全县的猪源、群众的要求和养猪习惯等情况及解决猪源、饲料、猪舍等问题的办法，在贯彻执行中县委及畜牧局负责同志又及时到各社进行检查总结。这是望城县生猪生产能够迅速发展的一个重要原因。
