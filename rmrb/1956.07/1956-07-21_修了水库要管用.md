Reservoirs Must Be Effective After Construction
Xu Da

Since last winter, more than 27,000 small reservoirs have been newly built across the country. These reservoirs will play a certain role in increasing agricultural production, and if used well, they can also intercept some floodwaters and reduce water disasters in some areas.

However, due to the large number of reservoirs built this year, and the lack of experience among the masses, coupled with the failure of technical guidance from business departments to keep up, many completed reservoir projects have serious shortcomings. Among the 688 newly built reservoirs in the three special districts of Shaoyang, Hengyang, and Xiangtan in Hunan Province, about 22% have incomplete engineering facilities or poor quality. The flood discharge capacity of the Shiqiao Reservoir in Dengfeng County, Henan Province, is less than one-tenth of what is actually needed. Jilin Province once inspected twenty-five small reservoirs (including four old reservoirs) in Hailong, Panshi, and Dongfeng counties, and cracks were found in all the water-retaining dams. In other areas, there are also many newly built small reservoirs with thin dam bodies, unsound ramming, water leakage from dam foundations and culverts, or a lack of flood control equipment. Some reservoirs appear to be of good quality on the surface, but because the dam body has not yet settled, there may still be hidden dangers, and it is not certain whether they can withstand the test of the rainy season. Now that the rainy season has arrived, if we do not seize the time to repair and remedy these reservoirs with poor quality or hidden dangers, and strengthen maintenance, these reservoirs will not only fail to fully exert their role in drought and flood prevention, but may also be washed away by floods, causing water disasters.

So, what exactly should be done to ensure the quality of the small reservoirs built this year? Recently, some areas have found some effective methods. For example, after the completion of small reservoirs, organize inspection and acceptance, find loopholes, and seize the time to repair them. Guangxi Province's approach is: first, the provincial water conservancy department stipulates engineering quality standards and acceptance methods, and is responsible for inspection and acceptance according to the size and nature of the project. In order to enable all inspection and acceptance personnel to correctly master the inspection methods and standards, demonstrations are first carried out, and then inspections are carried out universally from point to surface. Projects that are fully qualified are transferred to the management organization, which is responsible for management and use. Projects that are partially substandard but do not pose a risk of collapse are repaired by the construction organization. For projects with serious shortcomings, methods are studied on the spot, and forces are organized to remedy them as soon as possible, and work is not stopped until a certain standard is reached. In Guiping County, Guangxi Province, the original 32% of projects were substandard. After inspection and remedial work, the number of substandard projects was reduced to 8%. After the spring water conservancy construction was generally completed in Xiangxiang County, Hunan Province, a group of technical forces was drawn to re-measure the water inflow area of the reservoir and revise the cross-section of the flood discharge channel to strengthen the safety guarantee of small reservoirs.

After the reservoir is built, management and maintenance should be strengthened and not left unattended. The management and maintenance of the Hetang Reservoir in Lanxi County, Zhejiang Province, is relatively good. The benefited farmland of this reservoir is more than 800 mu, distributed in two villages and ten agricultural production cooperatives. After the completion of the reservoir, the benefiting cooperatives selected fifteen members to form a management committee to take over the reservoir. The management committee maintains frequent contact with the cooperatives to improve management work. They also send administrators to regularly inspect, maintain, and control water release. Usually, they also pay attention to water storage in the fields, try to collect natural rainwater, and save reservoir water in order to improve the reservoir's drought resistance capacity. The management committee of this reservoir also needs reserve maintenance workers to repair any damage at any time to ensure the consolidation of the project.

Some places are negligent and do not pay attention to the flood season protection of reservoirs, resulting in unexpected disasters. In order to prevent accidents, some areas in Henan Province stipulate that the current water storage of newly built reservoirs should be lower than the designed water level, and gradually accumulate to the designed water level after the dam body gradually settles to ensure the safety of the dam body. This approach is correct. During the rainy season, attention should be paid to changes in the weather. According to weather forecasts or rainfall conditions, before the flood arrives, a part or all of the reservoir's stored water should be released to prepare for the possible arrival of the flood, ensure the safety of the reservoir, and reduce the threat of flooding to the downstream. In addition, each reservoir should establish a protection and rescue organization, prepare rescue materials and tools, and establish communication equipment or stipulate emergency assembly signals. During the rainy season, special personnel should be designated to patrol or guard the reservoir day and night. Once a dangerous situation occurs, rescue should be carried out with all efforts to prevent accidents. Planting trees and grass in the reservoir's catchment area and building check dams, sedimentation ponds, and other soil and water conservation projects can delay the concentration time of floods and prevent reservoir siltation. All places where reservoirs are built should do this.

    修了水库要管用
    徐达
    从去年冬季以来，各地新修了27，000多座小水库。这些水库对于农业增产将起一定作用，如果运用得好，还可拦蓄一部洪水，减轻部分地区的水患。
    但是，由于今年修建的水库数量多，而群众经验却很不够，业务部门的技术指导又跟不上，因此，许多已完工的水库工程存在着严重的缺点。湖南省邵阳、衡阳、湘潭三个专区新建的688座水库中，约有22％工程设施不完备或质量不好。河南省登丰县石桥水库溢洪道的容量，还不到实际需要的十分之一。吉林省曾检查过海龙、磐石、东丰三个县的二十五座小水库（其中有旧水库四座），蓄水坝都有裂缝。其他地区也有许多新修小型水库坝身单薄、夯硪不实、坝基及涵管漏水或缺乏防洪设备。有些水库，从表面上看质量不坏，但因坝身还未沉实，可能还有隐患，是否能经得起雨季的考验，还没有把握。现在已经进入雨季，如果对这些质量不好或有隐患的水库，不抓紧整修弥补和加强养护，这些水库不但不能充分发挥防旱防洪的作用，而且可能被洪水冲毁，酿成水灾。
    那么究竟怎样做，才能保证今年建成的小型水库的质量呢？最近，有些地区已经找到了一些有效的办法。如在小型水库完工后，组织检查验收，发现漏洞，抓紧修补。广西省的做法是：先由省水利部门规定工程质量标准和验收办法，并按规模大小和工程性质，分别负责检查验收。为使所有的检查验收人员都能正确地掌握检验方法和标准，先进行示范，然后由点到面地普遍进行检验。完全合格的工程，即移交管理组织，负责管理使用。部分不合标准但不致有崩坍危险的，由施工组织负责补修。工程有严重缺点的，当场研究办法，组织力量赶紧补救，不达到一定的标准不收工。广西省桂平县原有32％的工程不合标准，经检验补救以后，不合标准的工程减到8％。湖南省湘乡县在春修水利大体结束以后，抽出一批技术力量，在事后补测水库的来水面积和修正排洪道的断面，加强了小水库的安全保证。
    水库修成以后要加强管理养护，不能丢下不管。浙江省兰溪县荷塘水库的管理养护工作是比较好的。这个水库的受益田有八百多亩，分散在二个村十个农业生产合作社。水库完工以后，由各个受益的合作社选出十五个委员组成管理委员会，接管水库，管理委员会同各社经常保持联系，改进管理工作。并派管理员经常检查、养护，掌握放水。平时，他们也很注意田间蓄水，尽量接蓄天然雨水，节省库水，以便提高水库的防旱能力。这个水库的管委会还需有养护的后备工，发现损坏随时修补，经常保证工程的巩固。
    有些地方疏忽大意，不注意对水库的汛期防护工作，以致发生了意外的灾害。为防止事故，河南省有的地区规定新建水库目前蓄水要低于设计水位，等坝身逐渐沉实以后，再逐步蓄到设计水位，以保坝身的安全。这样的做法是正确的。在暴雨季节，应当注意天气的变化，根据气象预报或降雨情况，在洪水到来以前，先把水库的存水放出一部或全部，准备容纳可能到来的洪水，保证水库的安全，减轻洪水对下游的威胁。此外，各水库还应建立防护抢险组织，准备好抢险物料和工具，建立起通讯设备或规定紧急的集合信号。在暴雨季节应当指定专人在水库昼夜轮流巡察或守护，一旦发生险情，立即全力抢救，防止出险。在水库集水区内植树种草，修建谷坊、沉沙池等水土保持工程，可以延缓洪水集中的时间，并防止水库淤积。修了水库的地方，都应当这样做。
