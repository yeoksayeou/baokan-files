Xinhua News Agency dispatch from TASS: Soviet Foreign Minister Shepilov stated on July 16th at the session of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR that it is very important for all the people of the world to stop conducting experimental explosions of atomic weapons without delay. If the United States and Britain are sincere, it will be easy to find an appropriate form for a corresponding agreement.

Shepilov said that, in our opinion, this could be achieved within the framework of the United Nations; or through a trilateral agreement between the governments of the United States, the Soviet Union, and Britain, subsequently joined by other countries; or by means of formal declarations by the aforementioned governments, guaranteeing that they will no longer conduct atomic weapons and thermonuclear weapons tests.

At the session of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR held on this day, a number of deputies, including Nesmeyanov and Ehrenburg, inquired of the Soviet government what measures it intended to take to universally cease nuclear weapons testing. These deputies endorsed the World Peace Council's call for the governments of the United States, the Soviet Union, and Britain to conclude an agreement on the immediate cessation of all atomic weapons tests.

In his reply statement, Shepilov explained the Soviet government's attitude on this issue and put forward the concrete measures mentioned above. He said that the appeal of such an authoritative and representative body as the World Peace Council should receive special attention from the three governments.

Shepilov said that any of the above methods are acceptable to the Soviet government, and the Soviet government is willing to begin negotiations with the United States and British governments on this issue immediately.

Shepilov pointed out that the Soviet Union is striving to genuinely guarantee the implementation of universal disarmament and the prohibition of nuclear weapons, and to establish an effective international system for supervising disarmament. Unfortunately, due to the attitude adopted by certain Western countries, it has not yet been possible to reach a universal agreement on this issue. Western countries have used all sorts of excuses to refuse to reach such an agreement. Recently, a statement was seen in the Western press saying that the Soviet Union is no longer interested in the issue of banning atomic weapons. This is an absurd and foolish fabrication.

The Soviet Union's recent proposal to first reach an agreement on the reduction of armed forces and conventional armaments is entirely due to the Soviet Union's efforts to find a way out of the deadlock.

Shepilov said that the Soviet government believes that the issue of stopping atomic weapons and hydrogen weapons tests can be considered separately from the general disarmament plan, and can be resolved now, without waiting until after the conclusion of a general agreement on disarmament.

Shepilov also said that, of course, stopping nuclear weapons testing is not a panacea for solving all problems. The main task is to achieve the complete prohibition of atomic weapons, the cessation of the production of atomic weapons, the prohibition of the use of atomic weapons, and the elimination of these weapons from national armaments. The Soviet government's position on this issue is very clear. Now it is entirely up to the governments of Western countries.

Shepilov said that stopping atomic weapons and hydrogen weapons tests themselves does not require the conclusion of any complex international supervision agreement, because under current scientific and technological conditions, any atomic or hydrogen bomb explosion, no matter where it occurs, can be detected immediately. To reach an agreement on this issue, lengthy multilateral negotiations are also not required, because the conclusion of such a treaty today depends solely on an agreement between the three governments that are currently capable of manufacturing such weapons, namely: the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union.

Shepilov announced that the Soviet government believes that it is necessary to conclude a trilateral agreement between the Soviet Union, the United States, and Britain on the immediate cessation of all atomic weapons and thermonuclear weapons tests and experimental explosions without delay.

    谢皮洛夫建议缔结苏美英协定
    停止核子武器的试验和实验性爆炸
    新华社据塔斯社报道　苏联外交部长谢皮洛夫七月十六日在苏联最高苏维埃会议上说，原子武器的试验性爆炸应当毫不拖延地停止进行，这对于全世界人民来说是很重要的。如果美国和英国有诚意的话，那么就会容易为一个相应的协定找出适当的形式。
    谢皮洛夫说，在我们看来，这可以在联合国范围内；或者通过美国、苏联和英国政府缔结一个三边协定，随后由其他国家加入这个协定；或者是通过上述政府各自发表正式声明，说它们保证自己不再进行原子武器和热核子武器试验的办法来实现。
    在这一天举行的苏联最高苏维埃会议上，涅斯米扬诺夫、爱伦堡等一批代表询问苏联政府，它打算为普遍停止核子武器试验采取什么措施。这些代表赞同世界和平理事会要求美国、苏联和英国政府就立即停止一切原子武器试验缔结协定。
    谢皮洛夫就在他的答复声明中，说明了苏联政府对这个问题的态度，并且提出了上述具体的办法。他说，像世界和平理事会这样一个权威的和有代表性的机构的呼吁应该得到三国政府的特别注意。
    谢皮洛夫说，上面这些办法中的任何一个，都是苏联政府可以接受的，苏联政府愿意同美国和英国政府就这个问题立刻开始进行谈判。
    谢皮洛夫指出，苏联努力切实保证普遍裁军和禁止核子武器的实施，和建立一种有效的国际监督裁军的制度。不幸由于某些西方国家采取的态度，到现在为止还不可能就这个问题达成普遍的协议。西方国家使用了各种各样的借口拒绝达成这种协议。最近在西方报纸上看到这样一种说法，说苏联已经对禁止原子武器问题不感兴趣了。这是一个荒谬和愚蠢的捏造。
    苏联最近提出要求首先就裁减武装部队和常规军备达成协议，这完全是因为苏联努力要找出一个摆脱僵局的办法。
    谢皮洛夫说，苏联政府认为，停止原子武器和氢武器的试验问题，是可以同普遍裁军计划分别开来考虑的，并且可以在现在解决，而不用拖到缔结一项关于裁军的普遍协定以后再解决。
    谢皮洛夫又说，当然，停止核子武器试验并不是解决一切问题的万应灵丹。主要的任务是做到完全禁止原子武器、停止原子武器的制造、禁止原子武器的使用并且从国家军备中取消这些武器。苏联政府在这个问题上的立场是十分清楚的。现在完全要看西方国家政府了。
    谢皮洛夫说，停止原子武器和氢武器试验本身并不需要缔结任何复杂的国际监督协定，因为在目前的科学和技术条件下，不论在什么地方爆炸了原子弹或氢弹，可以立即被发觉。为了在这个问题上达成协议，也不需要进行长期的多边谈判，因为这种条约的缔结，今天只取决于现在能够制造这种武器的三个国家即：美国、英国和苏联三国政府之间的达成协议。
    谢皮洛夫宣布，苏联政府认为：有必要毫不拖延地就立即停止一切原子武器和热核子武器的试验和实验性爆炸的问题，缔结苏联、美国和英国的三国协定。
