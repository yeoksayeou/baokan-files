Since the winter and spring of last year, with the emergence of the socialist upsurge in rural areas and the development of the Party's propaganda and education work in rural areas, the circulation of various books and periodicals in rural areas has greatly increased, which has played a certain role in enriching farmers' cultural life, inspiring farmers' production enthusiasm, and promoting the development of agricultural production. However, in some places, in the work of distributing books and periodicals in rural areas, the actual economic situation in rural areas and the cultural level of farmers have not been well understood, and the purchasing power of farmers and their cultural requirements have been overestimated. Therefore, books and periodicals are blindly promoted in rural areas, and in individual places, there have even been disguised compulsory apportionments. As a result, on the one hand, the economic burden on farmers has been increased, affecting agricultural production; on the other hand, the state's property has been stockpiled and wasted.

The situation of Xinhua Bookstore's Taigu County branch in Shanxi Province in distributing books and periodicals in rural areas is an example. The total amount of books in stock at the beginning of the first quarter of this bookstore this year was 2,900 yuan, but by the end of the quarter, the total amount of books in stock had surged to 4,300 yuan, an increase of 48%. The bookstore planned to distribute 500 sets of "The Socialist Upsurge in China's Countryside" (complete edition), but the Shanxi Provincial Branch of Xinhua Bookstore distributed 1,080 sets, sold 164 sets, and still had 916 sets in stock. The plan was to distribute 5,000 copies of "Model Regulations for Agricultural Production Cooperatives", sold 2,490 copies, and still had 2,510 copies in stock. The distribution of other books and periodicals also had this situation of supply exceeding demand to some extent.

With so many books not sold, is it because the bookstore's promotion efforts were insufficient? The manager of the Taigu County Xinhua Bookstore said: "Baihe Township has four agricultural production cooperatives, 33 production teams, and 121 production groups. Each cooperative bought a set of 'The Socialist Upsurge in China's Countryside' (complete edition), each team bought a copy of the selected edition of the same book, and each group bought a copy of the 'National Agricultural Development Program (Draft)'. The situation in each agricultural production cooperative in the county is roughly the same as that in this agricultural cooperative." What does this fact illustrate? First, the book and periodical distribution plan of the county branch was formulated too high and too large, lacking a reliable basis. Second, the provincial branch distributed books to the county branch without understanding the situation at the lower level, blindly increasing it by a factor of one. At the same time, this situation is related to the fact that the book and periodical distribution plan of the Xinhua Bookstore Headquarters is too high and too large. Third, due to the blind distribution of books and periodicals, a large amount of inventory has been created, making it difficult for the bookstore to turn over funds. Fourth, due to the blind distribution of books and periodicals, the number of publications has surged, artificially increasing the production difficulties of printing plants and the tension in paper supply.

Since the countryside doesn't need so many books, how are these books distributed? To quote the manager again: "We used a tough method to distribute so many. This tough method is: When the county convenes a meeting of township cadres, the bookstore first proposes specific targets for the distribution of books and periodicals, and comrades from the work team mobilize the township cadres. Then, the township cadres put forward a plan to buy books, and settle the payment for the books according to the price of the books and periodicals. The township cadres then issue an IOU to the bookstore, and the bookstore distributes the books according to the number on the IOU." The tough method adopted by the branch is related to the fact that the higher-level bookstores have increased the task level by level.

Some comrades believe that the more good books are sold, the better. Of course, good books should be distributed as much as possible, but it is also necessary to consider whether these good books are suitable for the target audience, whether the quantity is appropriate, whether the supply is timely, whether the masses can afford it, whether they are willing to buy it, and what the effect will be, and so on. If these issues are ignored, and we deviate from the actual situation and blindly pursue figures, then we will turn good things into bad things.

With the gradual improvement of rural economic life and the development of the movement to eliminate illiteracy, the demand of the peasant masses for learning culture is becoming increasingly urgent, and it is right to satisfy their needs for books and periodicals suitable for their needs to obtain agricultural production and scientific and technological knowledge. However, it is not right to blindly distribute a large number of books and periodicals to rural areas without considering the actual needs of rural areas and the economic affordability and cultural level of the peasant masses. We suggest that the cultural departments in various localities earnestly check the work of distributing books and periodicals in rural areas, and take effective measures to bring the work of distributing books and periodicals in rural areas into the normal track.

    不要盲目地向农村推销书刊 
    缪群
    去冬今春以来，随着农村的社会主义高潮的出现和党在农村宣传教育工作的开展，各种书刊在农村的发行量有了很大的增长，对于丰富农民的文化生活，鼓舞农民的生产情绪，推动农业生产的发展起了一定的作用。但是，有些地方在农村书刊发行工作当中，没有很好地去了解农村经济的实际情况和农民的文化水平，过高地估计了农民的购买力和对文化的要求，因而盲目地向农村推销书刊，个别地方甚至出现了变相的强迫摊派现象。结果，一方面增加了农民的经济负担，影响了农业生产；另一方面积压和浪费了国家的资财。
    新华书店山西省太谷县支店在农村发行书刊的情况就是一个例子。这个书店今年第一季度初期存书总额是2，900元，到季末存书总额便激增到4，300元，增加了48％。这个书店发行“中国农村的社会主义高潮”（全本）一书，原计划发行500套，但是新华书店山西省分店发下1，080套，卖出164套，尚存916套；计划发行“农业生产合作社示范章程”5，000本，卖出2，490本，尚存2，510本。其他有些书刊的发行工作，也多少有这种供过于求的情况。
    这么多的书没有销售出去，是不是书店推销不力呢？太谷县新华书店的经理说：“小白乡有四个农业生产合作社，33个生产大队，121个生产小组，每个社都买了‘中国农村的社会主义高潮’（全本）一套，每个大队都买了同书的选本一本；每个小组都买了‘全国农业发展纲要（草案）’一本。全县每个农业生产合作社大体上同这个农业社情况差不多。”这个事实说明什么呢？第一，县支店的书刊发行计划制定得偏高偏大，缺乏可靠的根据；第二，省分店向县支店发书，不了解下情，盲目地增加了一倍；同时，这种情况和新华书店总店的书刊发行计划偏高偏大是有关系的；第三，由于书刊的盲目发行，造成了大量的积压，使书店的资金周转发生了困难；第四，由于书刊的盲目发行，引起出版数量的激增，人为地增加了印刷厂的生产困难和纸张供应的紧张情况。
    既然农村里不需要这么多的书，这些书是怎么发行下去的呢？还用这个经理的话来说：“用了一个硬办法才发行到这么多。这个硬办法就是：当县里召开乡干部开会的时候，书店先提出发行书刊的具体指标，由工作组的同志去向乡干部动员，于是，乡干部就提出了买书的计划，并且根据书刊的价格结算书款，由乡干部打一张欠条交给书店，书店就按照欠条的数字发书。”支店采用的这个硬办法，是同上级书店层层加重任务有关系的。
    有些同志认为：只要是好书，卖得越多越好。当然，好书是应该尽可能的多发行一些，但是，也必须考虑到这些好书，对象是否合适，数量是否恰当，供应是否及时，群众能否负担，是否愿意购买，效果如何，等等。如果忽视这些问题，离开实际情况，一味追求数字，那就会把好事办成坏事。
    随着农村经济生活的逐步提高和扫除文盲运动的开展，农民群众对学习文化的要求日益迫切，渴望获得农业生产和科学技术知识，满足适合他们需要的书刊是对的。但是，不估计农村实际需要和农民群众的经济负担能力和文化水平，盲目地向农村发行大量的书刊，也是不对的。我们建议各地文化部门认真检查一下在农村中的书刊发行工作，并且采取有效的措施，把农村书刊发行工作纳入正常的轨道。
