Xinhua News Agency, July 20th: Obstetric and Gynecology experts from the Ministry of Health told Xinhua reporters: Heatstroke in postpartum women is a serious problem every summer. According to investigations by health departments, last summer, during the peak heat season, temperatures suddenly rose in various places, and many postpartum women suffered from heatstroke. According to statistics from ten counties in Hebei Province, postpartum women accounted for about 80% of those who died from heatstroke.

The experts said that some postpartum women follow old customs, keeping doors and windows tightly closed after childbirth, wearing many clothes, resulting in excessively high room temperatures and excessive sweating. The mammary glands also produce heat. Coupled with the exhaustion of childbirth, postpartum blood loss, and insufficient water intake, the heat generated in the body cannot be dissipated, making it very easy to suffer from heatstroke, sometimes even leading to death.

The experts said that the way to prevent heatstroke in postpartum women is to avoid overheating. Pay attention to ventilation in the room, sprinkle water on the floor frequently, and postpartum women should wear loose, breathable clothing. Bathe and wash hair frequently when sweating a lot, and braid the hair to keep the head cool. Drink plenty of water, preferably sanitary and cool beverages. If heatstroke occurs, quickly move the postpartum woman to a cool place, or make the room ventilated. Have the patient lie on their back, remove thick clothing, rub the back and limbs with shochu, or bathe with cold water, and feed large amounts of soda water and cold boiled water. If necessary, send the patient to the hospital for emergency treatment.

    防止产妇中暑的办法
    据新华社20日讯　卫生部妇幼卫生专家向新华社记者说：历年夏季产妇中暑的情况相当严重，根据卫生部门的调查，去年夏季中伏时节，各地气温突然增高，产妇中暑的很多，据河北省十个县的统计，在中暑死亡的人中产妇约占80％。
    专家说，有些产妇沿守旧习，在分娩以后把门窗紧闭，衣服穿得很多，室温过高，出汗过多，乳腺分泌也产生热度；再加上分娩劳累，产后失血，饮水不足，体内产生的热量不能散发，所以很容易中暑，严重的时候甚至死亡。
    专家说，预防产妇中暑的办法就是避免产妇过热。室内要注意通风，地上常常洒水，产妇衣服要宽大、透凉，出汗多时要经常擦澡，洗头，把头发编起来，使头部凉爽。多喝水，最好多喝卫生的清凉饮料。如果发生中暑时，要赶快把产妇移到凉快的地方，或使室内透凉，要病人仰卧，脱去厚衣服，用烧酒擦背部和四肢，或用冷水擦澡，并且喂给大量苏打水和凉开水，必要的时候应该送医院急救。
