Rewards

    The whistle sliced through the silent sky. Locomotive No. 1175, passing through the green signal section, pulled into Shanhaiguan Station.

    The driver frowned, glancing at the assistant driver and the stoker. In the past, there was always laughter and conversation when the locomotive arrived, everyone happy to have completed their task. But today? Everyone hung their heads, not saying a word. It was truly embarrassing to bring up: the locomotive had stopped before the slope and couldn't be pulled up no matter how hard they tried, eventually requiring a rescue engine to push it up. This was called a "slope stop" accident in railway terms. Such an accident not only delayed the train but also disrupted the entire operating order, and on top of that, a rescue engine had to be dispatched; no wonder some people said it was a waste of manpower and resources. Thinking of all this, the driver and his assistants regretted blindly exceeding the axle load. However, remembering the Party Branch Secretary, they couldn't help but sigh: "This was all the Branch Secretary's strong encouragement to exceed the axle load! If we didn't follow his opinion, wouldn't we be called in for individual talks and criticized all the same?"

    The locomotive finally stopped at the platform, and the drivers got off the train dispiritedly. Suddenly, the sounds of gongs, drums, and firecrackers erupted, and a crowd of people surged forward, forming a semicircle in front of the platform. The Party Branch Secretary, the Director, and the Chairman of the Labor Union of the Shanhaiguan Locomotive Depot stood at the front of the crowd, smiling broadly and applauding vigorously.

    What was going on? The drivers were confused. Before they could clear their heads, the Branch Secretary and the Director stepped forward and pinned honorary flowers on their chests, followed by bonuses. Then, the Branch Secretary delivered a congratulatory speech…

    In the past, after an accident, it was considered lucky to receive only a light reprimand. The Director and the Branch Secretary would even point their fingers at your nose, scolding you, "What are you doing?" and questioning you, "Are you a member of the working class?" Now, there was a sudden 180-degree turn. Not only were you not criticized for an accident, but you were even rewarded. This was difficult to understand.

    After 9 p.m., the Party Branch Secretary's office was brightly lit, and the room was filled with drivers. Some drivers were pulled into the meeting straight after work, without even time to eat. They listened to the Branch Secretary's instructions over and over again: "Be bold! As long as you can exceed the axle load and pull more, it doesn't matter if there are minor accidents. The Party supports you and rewards you. If anyone wants to restrict you from exceeding the axle load, that's right-leaning conservatism, which is precisely what the Party Central Committee opposes..." So, everyone understood that the reason why the No. 1175 driver was rewarded even after an accident was because they were "courageous in breaking conventions."

    The Director listened from the side, sweat constantly pouring down his forehead. These days, there were accidents every day, and he was criticized every day. Exceeding the axle load and pulling more was a good thing, but if a locomotive could only pull 2,300 tons, and you forced it to pull 2,600 tons, wasn't that clearly inviting accidents? If he offered suggestions, the label of "right-leaning conservatism" was frightening, especially since the Branch Secretary was looking for a "typical example." The more he thought about it, the more anxious he became, and beads of sweat kept rolling down his head, soaking his whole body. But as anxious as he was, the thought of not wanting to be a "typical example" ultimately prevailed, and the Director sat to the side, not saying a word.

    Exceeding the axle load truly seemed to be booming in a lively way. The Shanhaiguan Locomotive Depot was "boiling."

    The accountants, naturally, were not willing to lag behind under the inspiration of the Branch Secretary. An advanced plan for breaking the rules of payroll was put forward, and the payroll date was brought forward to the fourth of each month. The Branch Secretary nodded greatly upon hearing this. The movement was truly deeply rooted in people's hearts! So, it was decided to give out rewards again. Someone objected, saying, "The plan hasn't been implemented yet, so giving out bonuses might not be appropriate!" The Branch Secretary's vision was superior: "We're breaking conventions, aren't we! Comrades, rewards must be timely, they must be ahead of the plan!" This sentence silenced the others again.

    When the bonuses wrapped in red paper were distributed to the accounting office, the accountants became nervous. They held an emergency meeting and decided to go all out to achieve the plan of issuing salaries early. So, not only were weeknights out of the question, but they also had to endure the complaints of their spouses on Saturday nights, working overtime until late at night. Sundays were naturally no longer for family gatherings. After working hard day and night, the plan to issue salaries early was finally realized. The rewards that went ahead of the plan seemed to have worked, but no one had yet calculated how much this plan cost to implement.

    In those days, it truly felt like a golden age for the Shanhaiguan Locomotive Depot. The drums were being beaten to pieces, and sometimes sixteen or seventeen yuan's worth of firecrackers were set off in a single day. Mobilization meetings and symposiums followed one after another. The Branch Secretary was very pleased. Not long ago, when superiors came to inspect the progress of the advanced producer movement, he was at a loss. After several calls and several rounds of rewards, 108 advanced producers emerged. When the leaders came to inspect this time, they would have to change their views...

    Sure enough, the superiors came to inspect the work again. However, the conclusion of the inspection was very different from what the Branch Secretary had envisioned. The inspection revealed that in the very month that 108 advanced producers were selected, the entire depot had 23 "slope stop" accidents, and there were even days when seventeen or eighteen locomotives could not leave the depot. Due to blindly exceeding the axle load, accidents increased, and the workers' enthusiasm for production was severely dampened. The entire depot failed to complete its production tasks for several months. Although the calls were made again and again, and the rewards were unprecedentedly timely, they failed to provide the Party Branch Secretary of the Shanhaiguan Locomotive Depot with any help.

    奖励

    汽笛声划破了静寂的长空，一一七五号机车，穿过显示着绿色信号的地段，驶进了山海关车站。
    司机愁眉不展地瞅了瞅副司机和司炉。往日机车到站总是有说有笑，完成了任务谁不高兴。可是今天呢？大家都搭拉着脑袋，一言不发。提起来也真丢人，机车在坡前停下来了，怎么使劲也拉不动，结果还是救援车把它推了上来。这在铁路上被称作“坡停”事故。发生这样一次事故，列车晚点自不必说，整个运行秩序也被打乱了，再加上还要派出救援车，难怪有人说这是劳民伤财的事。想起这些，司机同他的助手们就后悔不该盲目超轴。不过，想起党总支书记，又不得不叹气：“这也是总支书记硬动员超的呀！如果不按照他的意见做，还不是要找去个别谈话，同样挨批评。”
    机车终于在站台边停了下来，司机们没精打采地下了车。突然间，锣鼓声、鞭炮声震天动地地响了起来，一群人涌上前来在站台前围成了一个半圆形。山海关机务段的党总支书记、段长、工会主席笑容满面地站在人群的最前面，用力地鼓着掌。
    这是怎么一回事？司机们糊涂了。没等他们清醒过来，总支书记和段长便走上前来在他们胸前挂上了光荣花，接着发了奖金，紧接着又是总支书记致贺词……
    如果在过去，出了事故后挨一顿轻一点的训，已经是万幸了。段长和总支书记甚至会把手指指到你的鼻尖上，骂你“干什么吃的？”责问你“是不是工人阶级”。现在，突然来了一个一百八十度的大转变，出了事故不仅不挨批评，反而得奖，这就很难理解了。
    晚上九点多钟，总支书记办公室灯火辉煌，屋内坐满了司机。有的司机下班后来不及吃饭就被拉来开会。他们一遍又一遍地听着总支书记的指示：“大胆干吧！只要你们能超轴多拉，出点小事故没有关系。党支持你们，奖励你们。如果谁想限制你们超轴，那就是右倾保守思想，正是党中央所反对的……”于是，大家明白了，一一七五号司机所以出了事故还得奖，正是因为他们“勇于打破常规”。
    段长在旁边听着，额上不断往下淌汗。这些日子天天出事故，也天天挨批评。超轴多拉是好事，可是有的机车只能拉二千三百多吨，硬要它拉二千六百吨，这不是明摆着把事故往身上揽。提意见吧，
  “右倾保守”的帽子骇人，何况总支书记正在找“典型”。他愈想愈急，汗珠不断从头上滚下来，把全身都湿透了。但是急虽急，毕竟还是不愿当“典型”的思想占了先，段长坐在一旁，竟一言不发。
    超轴，真像是很热闹地轰起来了。山海关机务段“沸腾”了。
    会计员们在总支书记的启发下自然也不甘落后，先进的打破陈规的发薪计划被提出来了，发薪日期也提前到每月四日。总支书记听了大为点头。运动真是深入人心哪，于是又决定奖励。有人反对说：“计划还没有实现，就发奖金，怕不好吧！”总支书记的见解却高人一等：“本来就是打破常规嘛！同志，奖励要及时，要走在计划前面啊！”这句话又堵住了别人的嘴。
    当用红纸包着的奖金发到会计室时，会计员们紧张起来了。他们召开了紧急会议，决定全力以赴，实现提早发薪的计划。于是，平日的晚上不用说了，就是星期六的晚上也只得忍受爱人的怨言，加班加点到深夜。星期日自然也不能同孩子团聚了。经过日夜苦干，提前发薪的计划算是实现了。走在计划前面的奖励好像起了作用，只是还没有人算过这个计划的实现究竟付出了多少代价？
    在这些日子里，对山海关机务段来说真是全盛时代。锣鼓敲破了，有时一天放十六、七元的火炮，动员会、座谈会更是一个接着一个。总支书记很得意，前不多久，上级来检查先进生产者运动开展情况时，自己还束手无策；经过几番号召，几番奖励，结果就涌现出一百零八名先进生产者。这次领导上再来检查，可得改变看法啦……
    果然，领导上又来检查工作了。不过，检查的结论同总支书记的设想大不相同。在检查中发现：就在评选出一百零八名先进生产者的那个月里，全段发生坡停事故二十三起，甚至一天有十七、八台机车不能出库。由于盲目超轴，事故增多，工人们的生产热情受到严重挫折，全段几个月都完不成生产任务。虽然号召是一而再、再而三，奖励是空前的及时，也没有能给山海关机务段的党总支书记以任何帮助。
