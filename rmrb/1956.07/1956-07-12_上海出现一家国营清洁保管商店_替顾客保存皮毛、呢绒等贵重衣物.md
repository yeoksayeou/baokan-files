    Shanghai Opens State-Run Cleaning and Storage Shop to Preserve Customers' Valuable Clothing Like Furs and Woolens

    (Our dispatch) Shanghai recently opened a service-oriented store for citizens undertaking cleaning and storage work – the State-Run First Cleaning and Storage Shop. This shop has a specially designed cold storage warehouse to preserve various furs, woolens, yarn, and other clothing items for customers, preventing them from becoming moldy or moth-eaten. This cold storage warehouse is different from ordinary cold storage warehouses. You cannot see rows of condensing pipes covered with frost in the warehouse, nor is there any humid, cold air. It uses isolated refrigeration equipment to blow dry, cold air through air ducts, keeping the temperature in the warehouse constantly between 40 and 60 degrees Fahrenheit. This way, the clothes remain very dry, and all kinds of moths completely lose their ability to breed and be active. When the shop accepts a customer's woolen Zhongshan suit or other clothes, they dry it in the sun, brush it clean, cover it with a cloth cover, and then send it to the cold storage warehouse for preservation, so that various clothes can safely pass through the moldy season. In addition, this shop also uses machines to wash carpets for customers and stores furniture for them.

    上海出现一家国营清洁保管商店
    替顾客保存皮毛、呢绒等贵重衣物
    本报讯　上海最近出现了一家为市民担任清洁保管工作的服务性商店——国营第一清洁保管商店。这家商店有一个特设的冷藏仓库，为顾客保存各种皮毛、呢绒、绒线等衣物，使这些衣物不会发霉和虫蛀。这个冷藏仓库，与一般的冷藏仓库不同。仓库里看不到一根根结着霜的冷凝管，也没有潮湿的冷空气，它是用隔离起来的冷气设备通过鼓风管吹出干燥的冷风，使库里的温度经常在华氏四十度至六十度之间，这样衣服仍很干燥，各种蛀虫完全失去它们的繁殖和活动能力。当商店里接受顾客一套呢制中山装或其它衣服后，他们便把它晒干、刷净，再用布套套上，然后送进冷藏仓库去保存，这样，各种衣服就能安度霉季。另外，这家商店还用机器为顾客洗涤地毯，代为保存家俱等。
