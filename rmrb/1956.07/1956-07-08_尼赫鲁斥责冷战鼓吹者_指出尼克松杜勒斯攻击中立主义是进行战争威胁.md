Xinhua News Agency, London, July 7th: Indian Prime Minister Nehru, on July 6th in London, condemned the remarks of U.S. Vice President Nixon and Secretary of State Dulles regarding neutralism as "undemocratic." Nehru said at a press conference: "I regret to say that Dulles's attack on the word (neutralism) was too fierce, even to the point of saying it was immoral." He also said that Nixon was also against neutralism.

Nehru said that Nixon and Dulles' attitude was a product of the "Cold War" and was meaningless except as a threat to wage a hot war. He said that it is "completely undemocratic" to insist that someone is "immoral" simply because they disagree with you. He added, "I ask them to consider: what they are saying now violates democratic choices and methods of thought, and violates democratic philosophy." Because "the essence of democracy lies in the fact that everyone can have different ideas, and everyone should be given the opportunity to express their opinions."

Nehru further stated that neutralism simply means adopting an independent policy. India does not side with either of the two major camps in the world. "We have an independent policy, and we judge according to the merits of the issues." Standing with one side means forced organization. "I oppose the forced organization of communism, and I also equally oppose the non-communist forced organization of peoples and countries." He said, "In the struggle between the two huge world power blocs, choosing the middle path is always the best policy. All that neutralism implies is being able to judge good and evil while maintaining one's independence."

Nehru believed that restoring China's legitimate seat in the United Nations is of great significance. He said: It is "fundamentally wrong" that 600 million people are not represented in this world organization. This is not a question of admitting new member states. The question is: What is China? "It is hard to say that some people in Taiwan are China."

Nehru also expressed regret that China was not invited to participate in the United Nations Disarmament Committee. He said that once a disarmament agreement is reached, China "will not be bound by any agreement." This is not a good thing.

    尼赫鲁斥责冷战鼓吹者
    指出尼克松杜勒斯攻击中立主义是进行战争威胁
    据新华社7日讯　伦敦消息：印度总理尼赫鲁七月六日在伦敦斥责美国副总统尼克松和国务卿杜勒斯关于中立主义的言论是“不民主的”。尼赫鲁在一次记者招待会上说：“我很遗憾地说，杜勒斯对（中立主义）这个字眼的抨击太猛烈了，甚至竟说它是不道德的”，他又说，尼克松也反对中立主义。
    尼赫鲁说，尼克松和杜勒斯的态度是“冷战”的产物。除了作为进行热战的威胁以外是毫无意义的。他说，人家不同意你的意见你就硬说他是“不道德的”，这是“完全不民主的”。他又说“我提请他们考虑：他们现在所说的话是违反民主的选择和思想方法的，是违反民主的哲学的。”因为“民主的实质在于一切人可以有不同的想法，而且应当给予一切人表示他们的意见的机会”。
    尼赫鲁又说，中立主义仅仅意味着采取一种独立的政策。印度不同世界上两个大阵营的任何一个站在一边。“我们有独立的政策，我们根据问题的是非曲直来进行判断。”而同某一方站在一起就意味着强制组织化。“我反对共产主义的强制组织化，我也同样地反对对各国人民和各个国家的非共产主义的强制组织化。”他说：“在两个巨大的世界大国集团的斗争中，选择中间道路永远是最上策。中立主义暗含的全部意义就是要能判断善恶而同时又保持自身的独立。”
    尼赫鲁认为恢复中国在联合国的合法席位具有重大的意义。他说：六亿人民在这个世界组织里没有代表是“根本错误的”。这不是一个接纳新会员国的问题。问题是：什么是中国？“你很难说在台湾的一些人就是中国。”
    尼赫鲁也对没有邀请中国参加联合国裁军委员会表示遗憾。他说，一旦达成裁军协议，中国“将不受任何协议的约束”。这不是一件好事情。
