    Pricing Based on Quality

    There is a Chinese saying: "You don't get good goods cheap, and cheap goods aren't good." Some people who cannot distinguish the quality of goods tend to think that expensive items are necessarily better than cheaper ones. However, this is not always the case. For example, regarding the yellow cardboard used for packaging in industry, the product from the Jiangsu Provincial Joint State-Private Hua Sheng Paper Mill has a relatively smooth surface, uniform thickness, and meets folding strength requirements, with a factory price of 188 yuan per ton. The product from the Hebei Provincial State-Owned Xuanhua Paper Mill has a rough surface, uneven thickness, varying moisture content, and is easily deformed, with a factory price of 260 yuan per ton. Another example is the Xiang Mao brand soap produced by the State-Owned Shanghai Soap Factory, which is fine, produces abundant lather, is durable, and has strong cleaning power, with a factory price of 15.5 yuan per case. The Da Lou brand soap produced by the Tianjin Joint State-Private Soap Cooperative is inferior to the Xiang Mao brand in all aspects, shrinks and deforms over time, yet its factory price is as high as 33.08 yuan per case, more than double that of the Xiang Mao brand. There are many similar examples.

    From the perspective of production enterprises, because equipment varies, technical levels differ, management quality varies, and the quality and price of raw materials are not the same, the quality and cost of products are not entirely the same. The phenomenon of "poor quality, high price" is understandable here. However, under the conditions of a domestic market uniformly led by state-owned commerce, the existence of the "poor quality, high price" phenomenon in the field of commodity circulation is incomprehensible and unreasonable. Selling inferior goods at high prices to users is irresponsible. If commercial departments purchase low-quality goods at high prices and high-quality goods at low prices, this will encourage production enterprises to focus only on quantity and neglect quality, and will encourage production enterprises not to pay attention to improving production technology. This becomes "penalizing the advanced and encouraging the backward," which is harmful to the development of production, especially to the improvement of product quality.

    This newspaper stated in its editorial on March 16th that commercial departments should price based on quality when processing orders to production enterprises or when purchasing products, and they should also price based on quality when selling goods. Pricing based on quality means giving high prices for good quality goods and low prices for poor quality goods. Different factories producing the same type of product should be priced based on quality, and different products from the same factory should also be priced based on quality. For the same product, if the quality produced today is better, a premium price should be given; if the quality produced tomorrow is lower, a lower price should be given. In short, as long as the product quality is different or unstable, the purchase price cannot be uniform and cannot remain unchanged. Pricing based on quality is more troublesome for commodity purchasing work, but it is necessary. After pricing based on quality, the good or bad quality of the product will be reflected in the enterprise's financial plan at any time and place: if the quality improves, the financial plan will be completed well; if the quality declines, the financial plan will not be completed well. This will urge every production enterprise to care about the quality of its products and urge commercial departments to improve their business management. Those units with good product quality and good management will pay more attention to improving quality; those units with poor product quality will become nervous and try to improve quality. Therefore, pricing based on quality is a powerful weapon to encourage the advanced to become more advanced and to promote the backward to learn from the advanced.

    However, some units and some comrades do not quite agree with pricing based on quality. They say: "Pricing based on quality is good, but it is not suitable for inland industrial enterprises." Why? Because the equipment and technical conditions of inland industrial enterprises are generally not as good as those of similar coastal industrial enterprises. Their product quality is either lower than that of the coastal areas or their costs are higher than those of the coastal areas. If priced based on quality, they would be in danger of being squeezed out, which would be detrimental to the development of inland industry. In fact, pricing based on quality should take into account the equipment conditions of each enterprise. As for industrial enterprises with relatively poor technical conditions or management levels, whether inland or coastal, as long as their products are needed by the state, in order to give them the opportunity to change their backward status, ways can be found to give them appropriate care. However, even with care, products should still be priced based on quality: if the product quality improves, a higher price should be given; if the quality declines, a lower price should be given. For backward enterprises that have not caught up with the level of advanced enterprises with the same equipment conditions, or that have not made any improvements, for the benefit of the country, consideration can be given to using advanced methods to replace backward ones for elimination or reorganization. In Tianjin, there is a Jiuxing Factory that manufactures steel wire screens. Before the third quarter of 1953, the quality was very poor and no one wanted the products. The Tianjin Planning Commission gave the factory a deadline of three months to improve, otherwise it would be shut down. After being pressured, the factory actively learned from advanced experience. As a result, in less than three months, the product quality really improved. This shows that if inland industrial enterprises are indeed backward, then adopting the method of pricing based on quality plus a time limit for improvement will not only prevent them from being squeezed out, but also allow them to quickly catch up with the level of advanced enterprises. This is not detrimental to the development of inland industry, but more beneficial.

    Some comrades are also afraid that pricing based on quality will reduce local fiscal revenue. Because the product quality of some local industries is not good, if state-owned commercial departments purchase at a unified price, then the losses caused by the accumulation or sale of products at depreciated prices will be borne by the commercial departments, and the income of the commercial departments belongs to the central government. After pricing based on quality, if the product quality is not good, the income of local industrial enterprises will decrease, and therefore local fiscal revenue will also decrease. This means that they are attempting to increase local fiscal revenue by increasing the losses of commercial departments, that is, reducing central fiscal revenue, which is of course a method that should not be adopted. After pricing based on quality, local industrial leading organs can only actively help their affiliated enterprises improve product quality to ensure local fiscal revenue. This method of increasing fiscal revenue through developing production and improving quality is beneficial to both the local area and the whole country in the long run.

    In the process of implementing pricing based on quality, another deviation must also be prevented, that is, the factory price remains unchanged after the product quality has improved. This practice will hinder the improvement of product quality. At present, because some products have not yet had quality standards established, the method of promoting pricing based on quality must be gradual, and should first begin with those products that have already had quality standards set. Relevant industrial and commercial departments should also negotiate the range of price differences that should be based on different qualities, so that all localities can refer to them for implementation.

    From all aspects, pricing based on quality is a completely reasonable method. It is an effective method for improving the quality of industrial products, and it should be unanimously supported and resolutely implemented by everyone.

### 按质论价

    按质论价
    中国有一句俗话说：“便宜没好货，好货不便宜”。有些不能鉴别商品好坏的人，也往往以为价钱贵的东西一定比价钱贱的好。然而，事实有时并不完全是这样。例如工业上用来包装的一种黄板纸，江苏省公私合营华盛造纸厂出产的，纸面比较平滑，厚薄均匀，折合力合于要求，每吨的出厂价格是188元；河北省地方国营宣化造纸厂出产的，纸面粗糙，厚薄不一，含水量有多有少，容易变形，每吨出厂价格是260元。又如国营上海制皂厂出产的祥茂牌肥皂，细致、泡沫多、耐用、去垢力强，每箱出厂价为15.5元；天津公私合营肥皂联社出产的大楼牌肥皂，各方面都不如祥茂牌的好，放久了还要缩水变形，每箱出厂的价格却高达33.08元，超过祥茂牌的一倍以上。类似这样的例子还很多。
    从生产的企业来说，因为设备好坏不一样，技术水平高低不一样，管理工作好坏不一样，原材料的质量和价格不一样，所以产品的质量和成本也不完全一样。这里出现“质次价高”的现象，是可以理解的。但是在国内市场由国营商业统一领导的条件下，在商品流通的领域内，允许“质次价高”的现象存在，就是不可理解的，也是不合理的了。因为把不好的东西高价卖给使用者，就是对使用者不负责。商业部门用高价收购质量次的商品，用低价收购质量好的商品，就会助长生产企业只顾数量、忽视质量偏向的发生，就会助长生产企业不注意改进生产技术。这就变成了“打击先进，鼓励落后”，对于生产的发展，特别是对于产品质量的提高，有害无益。
    本报在三月十六日的社论中说过：商业部门在向生产企业加工定货的时候，或在收购产品的时候，要按质论价；出售商品的时候也要按质论价。所谓按质论价，就是质量好的东西给高价钱，质量次的东西给低价钱。对于不同工厂的同类产品要按质论价，对于同一个工厂的各种产品，也要按质论价。同样一种商品，今天生产的质量好一些，就给以优价；明天生产的质量低一些，就给以低价。总之，只要产品质量不一样，不稳定，收购价格就不能统一，不能一成不变。对于商品的收购工作来说，按质论价是比较麻烦的，然而是必要的。按质论价以后，产品质量的好或坏，随时随地都反映到企业的财务计划上来：质量提高了，财务计划就完成得好；质量下降了，财务计划就完成得不好。这就能督促每一个生产企业都关心自己的产品质量，督促商业部门改善经营管理。那些产品质量好的和经营好的单位就会更加注意提高质量；那些产品质量不好的单位就会紧张起来，想办法改进质量。所以，按质论价是一种鼓励先进的使它们更加先进，推动落后的向先进看齐的有力武器。
    然而，有些单位、有些同志不大赞成按质论价。他们说：“按质论价好是好，但是不适合于内地工业企业。”为什么呢？因为内地工业企业的设备和技术条件，一般地都不如沿海同类工业企业的好；它们的产品质量不是比沿海的低，就是成本比沿海的高，如果按质论价，它们就有被挤垮的危险，这对于发展内地工业是不利的。其实，按质论价是应该考虑每一个企业的设备条件的。至于技术条件或者管理水平比较差的工业企业，不管是内地的还是沿海的，只要它们的产品是国家需要的，为了使它们有机会改变落后状况，可以设法给以适当的照顾。但是，即使是照顾，对于产品也要按质论价：产品质量改进了，就给高价；质量下降了，就给低价。对于经过照顾还没有赶上设备条件相同的先进企业水平的，或者毫无改进的落后企业，为了国家的利益，可以考虑用先进代替落后的办法来加以淘汰或改组。天津有个制造钢丝纱窗的九星工厂，1953年第三季度以前的质量很不好，产品没人要，天津市计划委员会限这个厂在三个月内改进，否则就停产。这个厂受到压力以后，积极学习先进经验，结果，不出三个月，产品质量真的提高了。这说明，如果内地工业企业的确是落后的话，那末，采取按质论价加上限期改进的办法，不仅不会被挤垮，而且还可以迅速赶上先进企业的水平。这对发展内地工业不是不利，而是更加有利。
    也有些同志害怕按质论价会减少地方财政收入。因为有些地方工业的产品质量不好，如果国营商业部门按照统一价格收购，那末，产品积压或贬价出卖所受到的损失，就由商业部门负责，而商业部门的收入是归中央的；按质论价以后，产品质量不好，地方工业企业的收入就会减少，因而地方财政收入也将跟着减少。这就是说，他们企图用增加商业部门的损失即减少中央财政收入的办法来增加地方财政收入，这当然是不应该采取的办法。按质论价以后，地方工业领导机关只有积极帮助所属企业改进产品质量，以保证地方财政收入。这种从发展生产和改进质量中增加财政收入的办法，从长远看来，既有利于地方，也有利于全国。
    在实现按质论价的过程中还要防止另一种偏向，那就是产品质量提高以后工厂价格依然不变。这样做法是会阻碍提高产品质量的。在目前由于有若干产品还未订出质量标准，因此，推行按质论价的办法必须是逐步的，首先应当从那些已定有质量标准的产品开始。有关的工商部门还应当商订由于质量不同价格应该差多少的幅度，以便各地参照执行。
    无论从那一方面来说，按质论价是完全合理的办法。这是提高工业品质量的一种有效的办法，它应该受到大家的一致支持和坚决实行。
