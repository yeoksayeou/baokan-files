Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, 16th. At the invitation of Hong Kong charitable organizations, the Chinese Folk Art Troupe will perform three pro bono performances starting on the evening of the 15th to raise funds to support charitable causes in Hong Kong.

The Art Troupe has newly arranged Peking opera programs such as "Mulberry Garden Meeting," "Killing Xiong Xin," "The Case of Chen Shimei," and "Entering the Palace Twice," as well as other new singing and dancing programs to enrich these three performances. Although Hong Kong charitable organizations have already raised the ticket price for the charity performance from HK$10 to HK$100, the audience from all walks of life who pre-ordered tickets is still very crowded, and the tickets for the night show on the 15th were quickly sold out. According to the statistics of the ticket office of the Reception Committee of the Art Troupe, by the afternoon of the 15th, pre-ordered ticket sales had reached nearly HK$120,000.

    为香港的慈善事业筹款
    中国民间艺术团义务演出
    新华社香港16日电　中国民间艺术团应香港慈善团体的邀请，从十五日晚间开始，将要义务演出三场，筹款资助香港的慈善事业。
    艺术团已经新排定“桑园会”、“斩雄信”、“铡美案”、“二进宫”等京剧节目和其他新的歌唱、舞蹈节目来充实这三场的演出。香港的慈善团体虽然已经将义演筹款的票价从港币十元提高到一百元，但是预购戏票的各界观众仍然十分拥挤，十五日夜场的戏票很快就卖完了。据接待艺术团委员会票务组的统计，到十五日下午止，已经售出预购戏票款近港币十二万元。
