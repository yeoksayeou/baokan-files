Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 10th. The Zhang Wei drilling team of the No. 131 team of the Northwest Coalfield Geological Exploration Bureau has set a new record for core drilling in the coal industry.

In June of this year, this drilling team drilled a total of 806 meters, which is 151 meters more than the highest monthly progress efficiency of the No. 508 drilling rig of the No. 117 team of the North China Coalfield Geological Exploration Bureau, which created the new national coal system core drilling record. The drilling quality also exceeded the national standards.

The workers of the Zhang Wei drilling team, who are working in the Weibei coalfield, studied the advanced experience of many model drilling rigs across the country from Sun Jingyang, a representative who attended the National Conference of Advanced Producers' Representatives, in May of this year. With the help of the exploration team's technicians, they comprehensively promoted many advanced experiences on their own drilling rigs. They used double sets of drilling tools to reduce auxiliary work time, adopted "drill collars" to increase the drilling tool pressure, and at the same time accelerated mechanical operation, increased drainage volume, and appropriately used different drill bits according to geological conditions, thereby greatly accelerating the drilling progress and improving the drilling quality. Dozens of drilling rigs scattered in the Weibei coalfield are now learning the fast drilling method of the Zhang Wei drilling team.

    西北一钻机创造新纪录
    新华社西安10日电　西北煤田地质勘探局一三一队张伟钻机组，创造了煤炭系统岩心钻探的最新纪录。
    今年六月，这个钻机组共钻进了八百零六公尺，比全国煤炭系统岩心钻探新纪录的创造者——华北煤田地质勘探局一一七队五零八号钻机的最高月进效率还要多一百五十一公尺，钻探质量也突破国家规定的指标。
    在渭北煤田上工作的张伟钻机组的工人们，今年五月学习了出席全国先进生产者代表会议的代表孙景阳传授的全国许多模范钻机的先进经验，在勘探队技术人员的帮助下，把许多先进经验在自己的钻机上综合推广。他们使用双套钻具，减少了辅助工作时间，采用“钻铤”，加大了钻具压力，同时加快机械运转，加大排水量，根据地质条件适当采用不同钻头，从而大大加速了钻探进度，提高了钻探质量。散布在渭北煤田上的几十台钻机，现在都在学习张伟钻机组的这种快速钻探的工作方法。
