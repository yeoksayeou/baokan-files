    Local Newspaper Commentary Summary
    Resolving Issues Left Over from the Wheat Season Pre-Distribution
    The wheat pre-distribution work of agricultural production cooperatives in Shandong is nearing completion. Due to rain during the wheat harvest, the pre-distribution work of agricultural cooperatives in various places was generally rough, leaving behind many problems. To this end, the Dazhong Daily published an editorial on the 26th entitled "Wheat Season Pre-Distribution Work Must Be Done Well From Beginning to End," calling on various localities to earnestly resolve the various issues left over from the pre-distribution.
    The editorial stated: The rough nature of this year's wheat season pre-distribution work is a common problem. In response to the above situation, some local party committees have already made timely arrangements for the "good beginning and good end" of the pre-distribution work. However, some local party committees, rural work cadres, and cooperative cadres believe that the pre-distribution work has been largely completed, and they feel that "everything is fine." In particular, some agricultural cooperatives, because they have indeed enabled more than 90% of their members to increase their income, have become complacent; many cadres also ignore the actual situation that some other members have reduced their income and are therefore dissatisfied. They believe that this is only a matter for a very small number of people and does not matter much. Little do they know that if they do not do a good job and properly handle these problems, it will become an unfavorable factor in consolidating the work of the cooperatives and completing this year's agricultural production increase plan.
    To this end, the editorial proposed that ending the pre-distribution work well from beginning to end should be regarded as an important part and condition for rectifying, consolidating, and developing agricultural cooperatives. Local party committees should, under leadership, conduct a comprehensive inspection of the wheat season pre-distribution work in an organized manner, and organize specialized forces according to the number of problems that exist, and seriously handle the various problems left over with a spirit of responsibility to the end. We must see whether more than 90% of the members have increased their income, whether the pre-distribution plan has been realized, and whether it reflects the principle of correctly combining collective and individual interests; what are the problems and reasons for not completing the pre-distribution plan requirements; whether work points and financial accounts have been cleared up; whether the actual income distribution of members is unreasonable; what problems remain in the determination of the treatment of cooperative cadres and the handling of "five guarantees" households, etc.
    The editorial specifically mentioned that appropriate arrangements should be made for some members who have reduced their income, according to different types. At the same time, they should also be helped to clear up their accounts and understand whether their income has really decreased or not. For members whose income has truly decreased, they should be helped to analyze the reasons and make plans for future attendance, so as to strive to increase income during the annual final distribution. If there are still difficulties in life after the wheat harvest, we should earnestly find ways to help them solve them. (Xinhua News Agency)

    地方报纸评论摘要
    解决麦季预分中的遗留问题
    山东各地农业生产合作社的小麦预分工作即将结束。由于麦收时期遇雨，各地农业社的预分工作一般作得粗糙，遗留了不少问题。为此，二十六日的大众日报发表了题为“麦季预分工作要做到善始善终”的社论，号召各地应该认真地解决预分中的各种遗留问题。
    社论说：今年麦季预分工作的粗糙现象，是个带有普遍性的问题。针对上述情况，有些地区党委已经及时地作了预分工作的“善始善终”的布置。但是，有些地区党委、农村工作干部和社干部，认为预分工作已经大体上完成，就觉得“万事大吉”了。特别是有些农业社，由于确实做到了90％以上的社员增加了收入，就麻痹自满起来；还有不少干部，忽视另外一些社员减少收入因而产生不满情绪的实际情况，他们认为这是极少数人的事，没有多大关系。殊不知如果不做好工作，把这些问题加以妥善地处理，将会在巩固社的工作和完成今年农业增产计划中成为不利的因素。
    为此社论提出应该把善始善终地结束预分工作，当作整顿、巩固、发展农业社的一项重要内容和条件。各地党委领导上，要有组织地对麦季预分工作进行一次全面的检查，根据存在问题的多少，组织专门力量，以负责到底的精神，认真处理遗留下来的各项问题。要看看90％以上的社员有没有增加收入，预分方案有没有实现，是否体现了集体利益和个人利益正确结合的原则；没完成预分方案要求的，有哪些问题，原因是什么；工分、财务账目有没有清理好；社员实际收益分配有没有不合理的地方；对社干部待遇的确定、“五保”户的处理方面还有哪些问题等等。
    社论特别提到：对于某些减少收入的社员，应分别不同类型，进行妥善安排。同时，还应帮助他们把账算清，弄明白到底收入是真正减少还是没有减少。对于真正减少收入的社员，应帮助他们分析原因，作出今后出勤打算，以便在全年决分时争取增加收入。麦收后生活仍有困难的，就应认真想办法帮助他们解决。　（新华社）
