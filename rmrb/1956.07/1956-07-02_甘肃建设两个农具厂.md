Lanzhou Dispatch: Gansu Province will build one new farm implement factory and expand another this year. Construction on the new Gansu Farm Implement Factory began in March, and is now in full swing. The main factory buildings are expected to be completed between August and September, and production will begin next year. Expansion of the Tianshui Farm Implement Factory, which is continuing this year, is nearing completion. Machines are being installed and production is expected to begin by the end of the year.

Once these two factories are fully completed, they will be able to produce more than 300,000 double-wheeled, double-furrow plows and hillside plows annually, as well as a large number of small and medium-sized farm implements.

In order to meet the current needs of farmers for new-style farm implements, some of the expanded facilities at the Tianshui Farm Implement Factory have already been put into production. The Gansu Farm Implement Factory will also carry out basic construction on the one hand, and put completed workshops into production on the other.

    甘肃建设两个农具厂
    本报兰州电　甘肃省今年新建和扩建农具厂各一座。新建的甘肃农具厂大部分工程已在三月开工，现已进入施工的紧张阶段，主要厂房可在八、九月间建成，明年投入生产。今年继续扩建的天水农具厂，厂房工程已接近完工，正在着手安装机器，年底可投入生产。
    这两个工厂完全建成后，每年可以生产双轮双铧犁和山地犁三十多万部，还可生产大量中小型农具。
    为了满足当前农民对新式农具的需要，天水农具厂的部分扩建工程已投入生产；甘肃农具厂也将一方面进行基本建设，一方面把已完工的车间投入生产。
