Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, July 18th: The Second National Congress of the Indonesian People's Youth League opened in Jakarta on July 16th. First Secretary Sukatno announced at the opening meeting that the Indonesian People's Youth League now has 700,000 members. In 1954, the number of members was 490,000.

    Sukatno said that the Indonesian People's Youth League supports the principle of peaceful coexistence and opposes the organization of aggressive military blocs. The People's Youth League fully supports President Sukarno's demand during his visit to the United States for the dissolution of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization. He said that the People's Youth League must strive for the liberation of West Irian.

    The leader of the Indonesian People's Youth League announced that this youth organization will support the good elements in the current cabinet's program, but he called on all members to widely express their hopes and demands so that a government that truly reflects the results of the general election can be formed. Sukatno believes that the abolition of the Round Table Conference agreements should become a struggle for national independence in the economic field. He demanded the establishment of free trade relations with all countries on the basis of mutual benefit.

    Aidit spoke on behalf of the Central Committee of the Indonesian Communist Party at the meeting. He explained that the current political line of the Communist Party is to develop progressive forces, unite intermediate forces, and isolate stubborn forces. He hopes that in realizing this line, the Indonesian Communist Party will be able to obtain the active and loyal assistance of the People's Youth League.

    The congress received many congratulatory messages from organizations such as the World Federation of Democratic Youth. The congress, attended by more than 500 representatives from across the country, will last for three days.

    印度尼西亚人民青年团举行代表大会
    艾地号召协助共产党实现政治路线
    新华社雅加达18日电　印度尼西亚人民青年团第二次全国代表大会七月十六日在雅加达开幕。第一书记苏卡特诺在开幕会议上宣布说，印度尼西亚人民青年团现在共有七十万团员。1954年的团员人数是四十九万人。
    苏卡特诺说，印度尼西亚人民青年团支持和平共处的原则，反对组织侵略性的军事集团，人民青年团完全支持苏加诺总统在访问美国时提出的关于解散东南亚条约组织的要求。他说，人民青年团必须为西伊里安的解放而努力。
    这位印度尼西亚人民青年团的领袖宣布，这个青年组织将支持现任内阁的纲领中的好的因素，但是他号召所有的团员广泛表达他们的希望和要求，以便使真正反映大选结果的政府能够组成。苏卡特诺认为，废除圆桌会议协定应当成为在经济领域内争取民族独立的斗争。他要求在互利的基础上同所有国家建立自由的贸易关系。
    艾地代表印度尼西亚共产党中央委员会在会上讲话。他说明共产党的当前的政治路线是发展进步力量、团结中间力量和孤立顽固力量。他希望在实现这个路线当中，印度尼西亚共产党将能够得到人民青年团的积极而忠实的协助。
    大会接到了世界民主青年联盟等组织拍来的许多贺电。这个有全国五百多名代表参加的大会将举行三天。
