    No Time to Manage the Cooperative's Work: For Whom Are We Working So Hard?
    Currently in Yongji County, Shanxi Province, we have this phenomenon: agricultural cooperative cadres are busy all day dealing with "official business" assigned by government agencies and departments, while cooperative affairs are squeezed into incidental work.
    Take the Liming Agricultural Cooperative as an example! On May 11th, the township government notified them to attend a civil affairs meeting at the township government in the afternoon. All twelve natural villages in the township had to be notified by the cooperative. The cooperative cadres immediately went to spread the word, running around all day. For example, on April 7th, the township government notified Liming Cooperative's accountants, Feng Xingzhi and Zhang Minghan, to attend a public bond meeting in the township on the morning of the 8th, requiring them to bring the purchase situation of each village, payment figures, and problems and experiences in the public bond purchase. The township government's notice was very simple, but the cooperative cadres were busy all day for this. Sometimes, even the opera tickets contracted by the township government had to be sold and collected by the cooperative cadres.
    Not only must the tasks from the township be completed, but the family disputes of the masses must also be resolved by the cooperative cadres. One day in early April, the Shi family in Changning Village had a family dispute, and the township government ignored it, telling them to resolve it at the cooperative. On May 19th alone, there were two such family disputes.
    Various departments increase the burden on cooperative cadres when they go to the countryside to carry out their own business. When the credit cooperative lends living expenses to cooperative members, the director reviews it, but it must also be approved by the cooperative director; the cooperative director spends a lot of time just approving the notes. In April, a Xinhua Bookstore salesperson came to the cooperative, bringing 280 copies of "New Socialist Things in the Countryside," placing them in the cooperative for the cadres to promote. A department store salesperson came to the cooperative, asking the statistician to pre-sell goods. The supply and marketing cooperative, timber company, and other units are also like this.
    This phenomenon makes the cooperative cadres feel very distressed. They no longer have enough time to consider and handle the affairs of the cooperative.

### 社里工作没空管  为谁辛苦为谁忙

    社里工作没空管  为谁辛苦为谁忙
    我们山西永济县当前有这么一种现象：农业社的干部整天忙着应付政府机关和业务部门派下来的“公事”，社务工作反而被挤成捎带的工作了。
    就拿黎明农业社的情况来说罢！五月十一日，乡政府通知当天下午在乡政府召开民政会。全乡共十二个自然村，都要社里去通知。社干部马上分头转达，紧跑慢跑就是一天。又如，四月七日，乡政府通知黎明社会计冯兴致、张名汉在八日早晨到乡里开公债会议，要求带上各村认购情况、交款数字和公债认购中的问题及经验。乡政府下个通知很简单，可是社干部就为此整天奔忙了。有时候，甚至连乡政府包下的戏票，也要社干部来销售和收款。
    不但乡里的任务要完成，群众的家务纠纷也要社干部解决。四月上旬的一天，长宁村师家闹家务纠纷，乡政府就不管，叫他们到社里解决。像这样的家务纠纷，五月十九日一天就有两起。
    各业务部门下乡搞自己的业务工作，也要给社干部增加负担。信用社贷给社员生活款，理事审查了，还要社主任批准；社主任光批条子就要花许多时间。四月里新华书店营业员到社里来，带来二百八十本“农村社会主义新事情”的书，放到社里让干部给推销。百货公司营业员到社里来了，让统计预售商品。供销社、木材公司等单位也是这样。
    这种现象，使社干部们感到非常苦恼，他们已经没有充分时间考虑和办理社里的事情了。
