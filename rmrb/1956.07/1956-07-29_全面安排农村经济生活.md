Editorial: Overall Arrangement of Rural Economic Life

    The Rural Economic Work Combination Conference convened by the CCP Shandong Le陵 County Committee (see the front page of this newspaper on July 28th), with the participation of the directors of the supply and marketing cooperatives, agricultural production cooperatives, bank business offices, and grain management offices, to comprehensively arrange rural economic life, is a very good way of working.
    Originally, individual farmers also arranged their own economic lives. Although some of their arrangements were very unreasonable, they generally had a set of rules for when to sow, when to harvest, when to buy things, and when to sell things, where to buy from, and where to sell to. Following these rules generally worked. After agricultural cooperativization, the farmers' mode of production and living conditions, sources of income and items of expenditure, have undergone great changes. Many old rules are no longer applicable, and new methods must be devised. How to arrange the economic life of the countryside has become a prominent issue.
    Currently, many departments formulate work targets in their offices and send them to various places to assign tasks; although the starting point is good, to "support farmers" and "build socialism in the countryside," the result is often not like this. Who can say that sending double-wheeled double-shared plows to farmers is a bad thing? However, haven't many places seen "sleeping plows"? Is it not convenient for farmers to send bacon and candy to their homes? However, because too much was sent and the timing was wrong, it was seen as a heavy burden by the farmers! Isn't it a good thing to let farmers hear the radio sooner? However, the farmers said, "Radio machines are too expensive, it's not the time to listen to them yet." Only being responsible to the higher authorities, focusing on completing numerical tasks, without asking whether the masses urgently need it, and without seeing whether it is actually possible, doing it blindly, inevitably and has already caused many phenomena of coercion and commandism. The masses are very dissatisfied with these phenomena.
    The seriousness of the problem is not just this. Various departments assign tasks separately, requiring completion within a limited time, proceeding simultaneously, and the lower levels can only follow and cannot choose. Thus, the principle of prioritizing tasks is destroyed. Various departments work on their own, without connection, or even competing with each other, thus, the principle of mutual cooperation and mutual support in doing work is also destroyed. With the above "issuing orders from multiple sources," the lower levels will of course feel "at a loss as to what to do," and of course complain about "heavy tasks, unable to cope."
    After agricultural cooperativization, party organizations and people's committees at all levels have the responsibility to take various appropriate measures to comprehensively and uniformly help agricultural production cooperatives arrange their economic lives. The Rural Economic Work Combination Conference convened by the Le陵 County Committee precisely meets the requirements of the broad masses of farmers. Everyone knows that the various works done by various economic departments in the countryside, directly and indirectly, are all for the purpose of promoting agricultural production and improving the lives of farmers. If everyone works well and cooperates well, they can help farmers overcome various difficulties and successfully complete their tasks. However, if everyone does not work well and does not cooperate well, it will add a lot of trouble to the farmers, and even hinder their production activities and restrict their freedom of life. The Le陵 County Committee convened a combination conference with the participation of all parties, and everyone discussed making a unified arrangement for various tasks: what to do first, what to do later, who contributes money, who contributes labor... all of which are stipulated in the form of contracts. In this way, everyone did not spend more money or invest more, but simply by organizing various forces and making a unified deployment and arrangement, as a result, the problem of stockpiled materials in the supply and marketing cooperatives was solved, the difficulty of lack of funds in the agricultural production cooperatives was overcome, the issuance of bank loans was also more appropriate, and the advance payment for unified purchase of grain was also used very reasonably. This is truly a win-win situation. No wonder the district party secretaries of Le陵 County reflected that the measures taken by the county party committee were very timely and pointed out a path for their future work. Indeed, in terms of the basic spirit of this working method, it is not just Le陵, but other regions should also do the same.
    Many rural cadres often say that they encounter various difficulties in their work. Some difficulties are inevitable and difficult to avoid. Some difficulties are squeezed out by the lack of connection and cooperation between various parties. Some difficulties are artificially created because of problems in this department or other departments' work. But no matter what the source and nature of the various difficulties, to overcome them smoothly, we should adopt the method that many people often say, "ask for instructions from above and seek help from the left and right." That is to say, not only should we ask the higher authorities for instructions on how to overcome the difficulties, but also ask the masses for advice on how to overcome the difficulties; not only should we mobilize all the forces in this region and this department to overcome the difficulties, but also actively strive for the assistance of neighboring regions and relevant departments. Whoever can do work in this way can do better and go faster. The Rural Economic Work Combination Conference convened by the Le陵 County Committee is not only a conference for arranging rural economic life, but also a conference for mobilizing the forces of various departments, supporting each other, and overcoming difficulties. Some materials of the Le陵 County Supply and Marketing Cooperative were placed in other counties and could not be transported back to this county in time to supply the needs of the people. Many agricultural production cooperatives had some surplus labor that could not find a suitable outlet for a while. These are difficulties for both parties. However, everyone discussed it at the combination conference, the supply and marketing cooperative paid the freight, and the agricultural production cooperative contracted to transport the materials, and the difficulties of both parties were easily overcome. If party and government leading organs at all levels can consciously use this method to do work, wouldn't the many difficulties encountered by rural cadres in their work be easier to overcome?
    In the past, many regions have also held similar meetings, made some good contracts, and made some good resolutions. However, after the meeting closed, some contracts were not fulfilled, some resolutions were implemented in a distorted way, and instead caused some new difficulties for the farmers. Why did this happen? The main reason is that the personnel in charge of the meeting thought that the problem was solved when the meeting ended, but they did not continue to conduct in-depth inspections, did not urge those who did not fulfill the contract to fulfill the contract, and revised the resolutions that could not be implemented or were not completely appropriate. After the conclusion of this meeting, the Le陵 County Committee transferred seventy cadres to go deep into the districts to check the implementation of the resolutions and revise inappropriate contracts. This approach is completely correct and worthy of learning from other regions.

### 全面安排农村经济生活

    全面安排农村经济生活
    中共山东乐陵县委召开农村经济工作结合会议（见七月二十八日本报第一版），有供销合作社、农业生产合作社、银行营业所和粮食管理所主任参加，全面安排农村的经济生活，这是非常好的工作方式。
    本来，个体农民也会安排自己的经济生活。尽管他们的安排有些地方很不合理，但是，什么时候下种，什么时候收获，什么时候买东西，什么时候卖东西，从那里买，向那里卖，大体都有一套规矩。按照这个规矩办事，一般是行得通的。农业合作化以后，农民的生产方式和生活情况，收入的来源和支出的项目，都发生了很大的变化。许多旧规矩不适用了，必须想出一些新办法。怎样安排农村的经济生活，就变成了一个突出的问题。
    现在有许多部门在办公室里定出工作指标，拿到各地去布置任务；虽然出发点是好的，是为了“支援农民”，“在农村建设社会主义”，可是得到的结果却常常不是这样。把双轮双铧犁送到农民手中，谁能说是坏事情？可是，许多地方不是出现了“睡犁”吗？把腊肉、糖果送到农民家里，对农民不是很方便吗？可是，因为送的数量太多，送的时机不对，却被农民看成是一笔大负担！早日让农民听到广播，难道不是好事情吗？可是，农民说：“广播机器太贵了，还没到听这个的时候。”这样只对上级负责，一心完成数字任务，而不问群众是不是迫切需要，也不看实际上是不是有这种可能，瞎干一气，必然而且已经引起许多强迫命令的现象。群众对这些现象是很不满意的。
    问题的严重还不只是这样。各个部门单独布置任务，要求下面限期完成，齐头并进，下面只能照办不能选择，于是，办事情必须分别轻、重、缓、急的原则就被破坏了。各个部门各干各的，互不连系，甚至互相竞争，于是，做工作要互相配合、互相支援的原则也被破坏了。上面这样“政出多门”，下面当然要感到“不知所从”，当然要埋怨“任务重、吃不消”了。
    农业合作化以后，各级党组织和人民委员会有责任采取各种适当的措施，全面地、统一地帮助农业生产合作社安排经济生活。乐陵县委召开的农村经济工作结合会议，正是符合广大农民的要求。大家知道，各个经济部门在农村作的各种工作，直接间接都是为了推进农业生产，改善农民生活。大家如果工作的好，配合的好，就能帮助农民克服各种困难，并且圆满地完成自己的任务。但是，大家如果工作的不好，配合的不好，就会给农民增加很多麻烦，甚至妨碍了他们的生产活动，限制了他们的生活自由。乐陵县委召开各方面参加的结合会议，大家商量着把各种工作做个统一的安排：先作什么，后作什么，谁出钱，谁出力……都用合同形式定好。这样，大家并没有多花钱，多投资，只是由于把各种力量组织起来，作了统一的部署和安排，结果，供销合作社积压物资的问题解决了，农业生产合作社缺乏资金的困难克服了，银行的贷款的发放也更适当了，统购粮食的预付款也使用的很合理了。这真是一举数得的事情。难怪乐陵县的区委书记们反映，县委采取的这个措施很及时，给他们今后的工作指出了一条道路。真的，从这种工作方法的基本精神来说，就不仅仅是乐陵，其他各个地区，也都应该这样作。
    许多农村干部常常说他们在工作中遇到这样那样的困难。有些困难是必然产生、难以避免的。有些困难是各方面互不连系、互不配合挤出来的。有些困难竟是因为本部门或者别的部门工作有毛病，人为地造成的。但不管各种困难的来源和性质怎么样，要想顺利地克服它们，都应该采取许多人常说的那种“上下请示，左右求援”的办法。就是说，不仅要向上级请示克服困难的办法，而且要向群众请教克服困难的办法；不仅要动员本地区、本部门一切力量克服困难，而且要积极争取友邻地区和有关部门的援助。谁会这样作工作，谁就能作的好一些，也走的快一些。乐陵县委召开的农村经济工作结合会议，是安排农村经济生活的会议，也是动员各个部门的力量，互相支援，克服困难的会议。乐陵县供销社有些物资放在外县，不能及时运回本县，供应人民的需要。许多农业生产合作社剩余一些劳动力，一时找不到合适的出路。这在双方都是困难。可是，大家在结合会议上一商量，供销合作社支出运费，农业生产合作社包运物资，双方的困难很容易地被克服了。如果各级党政领导机关都能自觉地运用这种方法做工作，农村干部在工作中遇到的许多困难，岂不是更加容易克服了吗？
    过去，有不少地区也开过类似的会议，定了一些好合同，作了一些好决议。但是，会议闭幕以后，有的合同没有履行，有的决议执行的走了样子，反而给农民造成一些新的困难。为什么发生了这样的情况？主要原因是主持会议的人员认为会议结束了，就等于问题解决了，而没有继续进行深入的检查，没有督促没有履行合同的履行合同，把不能执行的或不完全适当的决议加以修改。乐陵县委在这次会议闭幕以后，抽调七十名干部深入各区，检查决议执行情况，修改不适当的合同。这种作法是完全正确的，也值得别的地区来学习。
