    埃及设立运河管理委员会
    据新华社29日讯　开罗消息：根据埃及总统阿卜杜勒·纳赛尔的命令，埃及已经设立了苏彝士运河管理委员会。
    埃及报纸的报道说，新设立的运河管理委员会已经完全接管了前苏彝士运河公司的业务。在塞得港的前公司管理处大厦上升起了埃及国旗。原任苏彝士运河公司法籍董事长弗朗索瓦·夏尔·鲁克斯已经被埃及当局指令“无限期离职”。
    这个管理委员会宣布说，各轮船公司必须遵行新的缴费规章，并且警告说，如果它们不照办的话，它们的船只将被扣留在塞得港或苏彝士一直到它们遵行新的规章时为止。同时，据埃及报纸报道，埃及财政部长凯舒尼已经向所有在埃及经营业务的银行发出了一份通知，告诉它们苏彝士运河公司已经收归国有，并且设立了苏彝士运河的国家管理机构。凯舒尼通知外国银行说，属于前苏彝士运河公司的全部资金已经冻结。
