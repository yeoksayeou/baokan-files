Xinhua News Agency, July 14th: In the past two months, the Chinese Writers Association has held several meetings to study how to implement the policy of "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom, Let a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend" in the literary field. Those present expressed their opinions from various aspects on how to promote the healthy development of literary creation and art criticism based on this policy.

At two presidium (enlarged) meetings, special discussions were held on how to implement this policy. Writers Mao Dun, Zhou Yang, Lao She, Feng Xuefeng, Shao Quanlin, Wu Zuxiang, Zang Kejia, Yan Wenjing, Kang Tuo, and Qin Zhaoyang all expressed their opinions. They believed that in recent years, the themes of most literary and artistic works have been narrow and monotonous, and the creative styles have not been diversified enough. There is also a lack of a free atmosphere for discussion in art criticism. They pointed out that these phenomena, in addition to certain objective reasons, are mainly due to the dogmatism and one-sidedness in the past understanding of the policy of literature and art serving workers, peasants, and soldiers, as well as the creative method of socialist realism, which has limited the development of literary and artistic creation. The past crude and simplistic criticisms and inappropriate interference from relevant leadership have also been detrimental to the development of literary and artistic creation. Everyone believes that intervention must be taken on certain issues, such as the conspiracy activities of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique, but in artistic creation and academic exploration, independent thinking should be encouraged, and the development of different schools and styles should be promoted. Lao She said: We should overthrow the idol worship and make creation and life more lively. Wu Zuxiang said: "Let a hundred schools of thought contend" must be based on objective truth, and Marxism-Leninism is a summary of objective truth. This can urge people to study Marxism-Leninism more seriously.

The novel and essay group, poetry group, children's literature group, and theoretical criticism group of the Creation Committee of the Chinese Writers Association also held meetings separately.

Novelists and essayists focused on discussing the issue of overcoming formulaic and conceptual writing, and creating diverse artistic styles. Poets studied the content and form of poetry. They unanimously believed that the content and form of poetry should be rich and colorful, and there should be originality, especially in the methods of expression.

Writer Qin Zhaoyang said that the creative method should be created by writers in their creative practice, and no one can make rigid regulations. The creative method of socialist realism is also very broad, and it should help to give play to the creativity of each writer and create various different artistic styles.

Writer Zhang Henshui said that the scope of themes of literary and artistic works should be infinitely broad, and it can both praise the new society and criticize the old society. He said that this would allow writers to make the most of their strengths and write about what they are most familiar with.

The old poet Wang Jingzhi criticized the Chinese Writers Association for its past shortcomings in not providing universal care and help to poets. He said: A seed needs water, sunlight, and other conditions to blossom. To promote the blooming of a hundred flowers, most seeds must have the conditions to bloom.

Children's literature writers pointed out in the discussion that strict rules and regulations are one of the main reasons for the lack of prosperity in children's literature creation. They believe that while children's literature works are tasked with educating children, they cannot force writers to write entirely from the perspective and methods of educators, nor can they equate the educational role of literary works for children with the educational role of schools. Writer Zhang Tianyi said that strict rules and regulations are sometimes set by writers themselves. Writers should make up their minds, create boldly, and not be bound by strict rules and regulations.

Literary theorists, critics, and writers raised sharp opinions on the work of literary theory and criticism in recent years. They pointed out that literary theory and criticism work has indeed made great achievements in defending the direction of literature and art serving workers, peasants, and soldiers and criticizing the erroneous literary and artistic thoughts of the bourgeoisie, but the shortcomings are also serious. They believe that the problem with literary theory and criticism workers is that they have not properly mastered and used the weapons of literary theory and criticism. Generally, common literary theory and criticism articles often focus on the evaluation of the political content of the works, and rarely make specific analyses from the artistic aspect. Not enough care for literary and artistic creation and respect for writers' labor are also lacking. Everyone believes that, unfortunately, this kind of criticism has almost formed a social atmosphere. They cited many facts to illustrate the severity of it. For example, after some works satirizing the backward phenomena within the people were published recently, some readers accused the authors of slandering the new society, but these works are precisely of great social significance and play a great educational role.

Writer Xiao Yemu talked about the undue neglect he had suffered for a long time because some of his previously published works were criticized. He said that criticism of literary and artistic creation must not be lightly turned into personal attacks on those who are criticized, which will inevitably affect his courage and confidence to recreate, and the due effect of literary criticism cannot be obtained.

Theoretical critics also raised many opinions at the meeting. Some people analyzed the historical roots of the formation of the social atmosphere, pointing out that it is unfair to excessively blame literary theory and criticism work, and that it has already caused many concerns for theoretical criticism workers, and adopted a negative attitude towards literary and artistic creation. Writer Shu Wu said: In recent years, there has been too little encouragement for theoretical criticism work. No fair evaluation has been made on which criticisms are correct and have played a good role.

Liu Baiyu, First Secretary of the Secretariat of the Chinese Writers Association, reported to everyone at a recent enlarged meeting of the Secretariat about the vigorous atmosphere he saw in Chongqing, Kunming and other branches of the Chinese Writers Association in June when he visited these areas to implement the policy of "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom, Let a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend." Inspired by this policy, the local writers' enthusiasm for creation is unprecedentedly high. Li Jieren, an old writer from Sichuan Province who is sixty-six years old, has also set a plan to complete the writing of nine novels before he turns seventy-eight. Many writers have actively devoted themselves to life. Literary theory and criticism work has also begun to become active. Non-Party writers have made sharp criticisms of the sectarian sentiments of some Party-member writers, demanding that "sectarianism be transformed into scholarship." Liu Baiyu said: Judging from the high enthusiasm for creation and the eagerness for "Let a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend" among writers in Chengdu, Chongqing, Kunming, and other places, as long as the relevant parties seriously lead, change the status quo of theoretical criticism, vigorously support creation, improve the work of literary journals, and open up a venue for "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom, Let a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend," our literary creation will surely move towards prosperity.

### 促进文学创作和文艺批评健康发展  中国作家协会研究执行“百花齐放，百家争鸣”的方针

    促进文学创作和文艺批评健康发展
    中国作家协会研究执行“百花齐放，百家争鸣”的方针
    新华社14日讯　近两个月来，中国作家协会连续举行多次会议，研究在文学领域内如何贯彻“百花齐放，百家争鸣”的方针。到会的人都根据这个方针，对于如何促进文学创作和文艺理论批评的健康发展问题，从多方面发表了各自的见解。
    在两次主席团（扩大）会议上，专门就如何执行这一方针作了讨论。作家茅盾、周扬、老舍、冯雪峰、邵荃麟、吴组缃、臧克家、严文井、康濯、秦兆阳等都发表了意见。他们认为近几年来大部分文艺作品题材范围狭窄、单调，创作风格不够多样化。在文艺评论方面也缺少自由讨论的风气。他们指出，这种现象除了有一定的客观原因之外，主要是由于过去对于文艺为工农兵服务的方针，以及对社会主义现实主义创作方法的理解存在着教条主义和片面性，以至使文艺创作的发展受到了限制。过去存在的粗暴的、简单化的批评和有关领导方面不适当的干涉，也都对文艺创作的发展不利。大家认为对某些问题，如对胡风反革命集团的阴谋活动是必须加以干涉的，但在艺术创造和学术探讨上，应该提倡独立思考，鼓励不同流派，不同风格的发展。老舍说：应该打倒偶像崇拜，使创作和生活都更加活泼一些。吴组缃说：“百家争鸣”必须根据客观真理，而马克思列宁主义是客观真理的概括，这样，正可以督促人们更认真地学习马克思列宁主义。
    中国作家协会创作委员会的小说散文组、诗歌组、儿童文学组和理论批评组也分别举行了会议。
    小说、散文作家们着重讨论了克服公式化、概念化，创造多种多样艺术风格的问题。诗人们环绕着诗歌的内容和形式问题作了研究。他们一致认为诗的内容和形式都应该是丰富多采的，特别在表现方法上应该有独创性。
    作家秦兆阳说，创作方法应该是由作家在创作实践中创造出来的，任何人也不能加以硬性的规定。就是社会主义现实主义创作方法也是非常宽阔的，它应该有助于发挥每个作家的创造性，创造出各种各样不同的艺术风格来。
    作家张恨水说，文艺作品的题材范围应该是无限宽广的，既可以歌颂新社会，也可以批判旧社会。他说，这样才可以让作家各尽所长，写自己最熟悉的东西。
    老诗人汪静之对中国作家协会过去对诗人们的关怀和帮助不够普遍的缺点作了批评。他说：一颗种子要得到了水分、阳光等等条件才能开花，要促使百花齐放，必须让多数种子都具备开花的条件。
    儿童文学家们在讨论中指出：清规戒律是儿童文学创作不繁荣的主要原因之一，他们认为儿童文学作品固然是以教育儿童为任务的，但不能强求作家完全用教育家的观点、方法来写作，也不能把文学作品对儿童的教育作用和学校的教育作用等同起来。作家张天翼说，清规戒律有时候是作家自己定下的。作家应该拿定主意，大胆创作，不要被清规戒律所约束。
    文艺理论批评家和作家们对近几年间的文艺理论批评工作提出了尖锐的意见。他们指出，文艺理论批评工作在捍卫文艺为工农兵服务的方向和批判资产阶级错误文艺思想等方面确有很大成就，可是缺点也是严重的。他们认为理论批评工作者存在的问题是没有恰当地掌握和运用文艺理论批评的武器，一般常见的文艺理论批评文章往往偏重于对作品政治内容的评价，而很少从艺术性方面作具体的分析。对文艺创作的爱护，对作家劳动的尊重也都是不够的。大家认为不幸的是这样的批评方式，几乎已经形成了社会风气。他们列举许多事实，说明其严重程度。例如，最近一些讽刺人民内部落后现象的作品发表之后，就有一部分读者指责作者诽谤新社会，而这些作品却正是有着重大社会意义和起着很大教育作用的。
    作家肖也牧讲到他由于过去发表的某些作品被批评之后而长期受到的不应有的冷遇。他说，切不可把对文艺创作的批评轻率地变成对被批评者的人身攻击，这样势必影响他重新创作的勇气和信心，得不到文艺批评应有的效果。
    理论批评家们也在会上提出了很多意见。有些人分析了形成社会风气的历史根源，指出过多地责备文艺理论批评工作是不公平的，而且已经由此而使理论批评工作者产生许多顾虑，对文艺创作采取消极态度。作家舒芜说：近几年来对理论批评工作的鼓励太少了，究竟有那些批评是正确的，起了良好作用的，都没有作公正的评价。
    中国作家协会书记处第一书记刘白羽在最近召开的一次书记处（扩大）会议上向大家报告了他六月间访问中国作家协会重庆、昆明等地分会时看到这些地区贯彻执行“百花齐放，百家争鸣”方针的蓬勃气象。当地作家在这一方针鼓舞之下，创作热情空前高涨，四川省六十六岁的老作家李劼人也订出了在七十八岁之前要完成写作九部长篇小说的计划。很多作家都已积极投入生活。文艺理论批评工作也已在开始活跃。非党作家对某些党员作家的宗派情绪提出了尖锐的批评，要求“化宗派为学派”。刘白羽说：从成都、重庆、昆明等地的作家们创作热情之高和对“百家争鸣”要求之切的情形看来，只要有关方面认真加以领导，改变理论批评的现状、大力支持创作；改进文艺刊物的工作；开辟“百花齐放，百家争鸣”的场地，我们的文学创作就一定可以走向繁荣。
