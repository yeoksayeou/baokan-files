Xinhua News Agency report: A new atmosphere has emerged in scientific research at Tianjin University, with teachers actively engaging in 119 scientific research projects.

At the beginning of this year, only one-third of the teachers in Tianjin University participated in scientific research. The reason was that leaders at the school, department, and teaching and research office levels, as well as some teachers, regarded scientific research as too advanced, underestimated their own capabilities, and emphasized a lack of experience. After thoroughly studying the problems existing in scientific research work and extensively learning from the experiences of other universities, the school focused on criticizing conservative thinking in scientific research. Now, the majority of teachers in the school have been mobilized. The steel and wood structure teaching and research office of the Civil Engineering Department originally had only three teachers proposing scientific research topics, but now all ten teachers in the teaching and research office are conducting scientific research. Professors in the Physics teaching and research office are also leading young teachers in researching semiconductors, material magnetism, and other issues. In the hydraulic laboratory of the Hydraulic Engineering Department, teachers can now be seen conducting scientific research experiments all day long.

Tianjin University has also recently completed a number of scientific research papers with a certain scientific level and practical value, five of which have been submitted by Tianjin University to the Ministry of Higher Education as important scientific research topics of the school. "Trial Production of Contact Welding Chromium Bronze Electrodes," completed in cooperation by teachers of the Metalworking teaching and research office of the Mechanical Engineering Department, is one of them. This research was commissioned by the production department. Chromium bronze electrodes are not only very useful for welding oil drums in the petroleum industry, but also have great practical value in the manufacturing of automobiles and aircraft, as well as in tool welding.

### 天津大学科学研究的新气象

    天津大学科学研究的新气象
    据新华社讯　天津大学出现了科学研究的新气象，教师们正在积极地进行一百一十九项科学研究。
    在今年年初天津大学参加科学研究的教师只占全校教师的三分之一。原因是学校、系和教研室的领导方面以及一些教师把科学研究看得太高，把自己力量估计过低，强调缺乏经验。学校在深入研究了科学研究工作中存在的问题和广泛地学习了其他高等学校的经验以后，着重批判了科学研究中的保守思想。现在全校多数的教师已经发动起来。土木工程系钢木结构教研室原来只有三个教师提出科学研究题目，现在全教研室的十个教师都进行科学研究了。物理教研室的教授们也正领导着年轻的教师进行半导体、物质磁性等问题的研究。在水利工程系的水利馆里，现在整天都可以看见教师们在进行科学研究的实验。
    天津大学在最近还完成了一些具有一定科学水平和实用价值的科学研究论文，其中有五篇已经由天津大学作为学校的重要科学研究题目呈报给高等教育部。机械工程系金属工学教研室教师们合作完成的“接触焊接铬青铜电极的试制”就是其中的一项。这项研究是接受生产部门的委托进行的。铬青铜电极不仅对石油工业方面的焊接油桶有很大用处，而且对汽车、飞机制造业以及刀具焊接方面都有很大的实用价值。
