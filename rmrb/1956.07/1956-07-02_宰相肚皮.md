    A Prime Minister's Belly
    Chang Lu
    "A prime minister's belly can float a boat." This saying reflects the people's long-held desire for leaders to have great tolerance, although such prime ministers have been rare throughout history.
    Today's era is different. The people's cause requires a new type of leader. This kind of leader is, of course, very different from the prime ministers of the old days. But for anyone doing leadership work today, the people still demand that he "have a belly that can float a boat." Or, more correctly, the people have even more reason to demand that leaders have a grand and broad-minded style, and oppose a narrow-minded and petty style.
    Whether the policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend" can be implemented depends to a considerable extent on whether the leaders of literature and art have great tolerance. Taking artistic creation and art education in the past few years as an example, in my opinion, that tolerance is not great. In music and art, some comrades, even responsible comrades, have not taken traditional Chinese painters, folk music, and folk artists to heart. The situation in opera is better, but there are still some types of opera and repertoire that have almost been submerged; very few concrete measures have been taken in the area of national traditional education in art.
    Western European cultural history has the Greek and Roman eras, and our cultural history also has the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods; Western Europe has the Renaissance, and we also have the glorious and splendid era since the Tang and Song dynasties. What right do we have to bury the extremely rich and diverse historical treasures in the dust, or even trample on them? Of course, we must learn from all the advanced and beneficial things from foreign countries, but if foreign countries also cherish their national historical heritage, why shouldn't we?
    Our long-term plan advocates the creation of diverse schools of thought. Just as the "Book of Changes" says: "The world tends to the same goal by different routes, and arrives at the same destination through a hundred deliberations." Today, as long as we "agree" with the Party's policies and guidelines, and "tend to the same goal" of socialist construction, "a hundred deliberations" and "different routes" are completely permissible and should be allowed. In this way, the relevant leaders must have great tolerance. Conversely, if they do not enlarge their bellies, then their bellies will feel the pain of being squeezed in the grand occasion of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend," until they are burst. However, we do not want this undesirable thing to happen. Therefore, let our bellies be even bigger than the belly of a prime minister "who can float a boat."

    宰相肚皮
    长路
    “宰相肚里能撑船”，这句话反映了历来人民对于领导人物要有大度量的一种愿望，虽然历史上这样的宰相并不多见。
    今天的时代不同了。人民的事业要求新型的领导者。这种领导者同旧日的宰相当然有很多不同。但是对于今天不论做什么领导工作的人，人民也一样要求他“肚里能撑船”。或者更正确些说，人民更有理由要求领导者具有气魄宏大、胸襟宽广的作风，而反对气量短浅、胸怀狭窄的作风。
    “百花齐放，百家争鸣”的方针能不能贯彻，在相当的程度上要看文艺和学术的领导人有没有大的度量。单拿几年来的艺术创作和艺术教育来说，据我看，那度量是不大的。在音乐和美术方面有的同志甚至是负责的同志，就没有把国画家、民族音乐和民间艺人放在心里。戏曲的情况比较好点，但也还是有些剧种和剧目几乎被湮没；在艺术的民族传统教育方面，采取的具体措施很少很少。
    西欧的文化史上有希腊罗马时代，我们的文化史上也有春秋战国时代；西欧有文艺复兴时代，我们也有唐宋以来辉煌灿烂的时代。我们有什么权利把极为丰富多采的历史宝藏埋没在尘土之中，甚至践踏它呢？我们当然要学习外国的一切先进的、对我们有益的东西，但是如果外国也珍视他们民族的历史遗产，我们为什么就不该这样呢？
    我们远景规划里，是提倡创立多样流派的。正像“易经”上说的：“天下同归而殊涂，一致而百虑”。今天，只要“一致”于党的政策路线，“同归”于社会主义建设，“百虑”和“殊涂”是完全可以允许而且应该的。这样，有关的领导人就必需有大的度量。相反的，如果不把自己的肚皮放大一些，那么，他们的肚皮就将会在“百花齐放，百家争鸣”的盛况下感到挨挤的痛苦，直到被挤破为止。然而，这种万无一得的事，我们是不愿它出现的。因此还是让我们的肚皮比“能撑船”的宰相的肚皮更大些吧。
