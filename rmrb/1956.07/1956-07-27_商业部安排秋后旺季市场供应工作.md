Xinhua News Agency, July 26th. The Ministry of Commerce, at the National Commerce Bureau Directors' Conference held in Beijing, arranged the market supply work for the peak season after autumn.

Based on the situation of industrial and agricultural production this year, as well as new circumstances such as the increase in state loans to agriculture and the comprehensive adjustment of wages for workers and staff nationwide, the conference estimates that the national markets in major cities and vast rural areas will see new activity in the second half of this year, and the national purchasing power will increase by 15% compared to last year.

The task of the national commercial system in the second half of the year, as determined by the conference, is to mobilize all favorable factors, actively organize the supply of materials, meet the needs of the people as much as possible, and stabilize market prices. Corresponding measures should be taken in commodity supply, price policy, organizational work, allocation, storage, and transportation to ensure the completion of the above tasks.

In terms of commodity supply, the conference required that, for certain national production materials that are in short supply and for which the state cannot increase allocations in the second half of the year, such as steel and hardware, all regions should actively organize supply from existing sources and try to organize the supply of waste materials and substitutes. To alleviate the impact of steel shortages on the overall market commodity supply, commercial departments should prioritize allocating the steel they have on hand to daily-use merchandise production and processing units.

For daily-use merchandise, cotton textiles, and cultural and educational supplies that urban and rural residents universally need after autumn, vigorous promotion should be carried out, and there should be no conservative reluctance to sell; to do a good job in this aspect of supply, the method of frequent collection, transportation, and supply can be adopted. For some long-term stockpiles of damaged or deteriorated goods, prices can be appropriately reduced for sale. High-grade commodities currently stockpiled in some county towns and market towns should be transferred back to large and medium-sized cities or industrial and mining areas for supply. If regions have commodities that are not suitable for the needs of local residents, they should organize exchanges and adjustments between each other.

According to the conference's reflection, many places have recently experienced blind ordering of goods during the organization of supply. Due to the fact that certain regions have sent people everywhere to seize sources of goods, artificially creating a tense situation in the market, the conference believes that this chaotic situation must be corrected. However, it is still permissible for commercial departments in various regions to send personnel to production areas to freely purchase small commodities, non-planned commodities, and commodities in the planned category that are surplus after free subscription through supply conferences.

The conference determined that the supply volume of major commodities in the second half of this year will increase significantly compared to the same period last year. The increase for commodities such as cotton cloth, sugar, rubber shoes, bicycles, matches, towels, socks, undershirts, radios, and sewing machines ranges from 16% to 3.9 times.

This conference specifically studied the supply problems in new industrial and mining areas. It was considered that the commercial network and material supply work in the new industrial and mining areas are not keeping up with the development requirements of the new industrial and mining areas. To improve the supply work in the new industrial and mining areas, the conference believes that it is necessary to solve problems such as commercial organization, commercial personnel, commercial settings, and transportation tools, and requests that Party and government leading organs in various regions regard the basic construction of commercial and service industries in new industrial and mining areas as part of productive construction and strengthen leadership. The most difficult problems in the new industrial and mining areas are the supply of vegetables, meat, and other non-staple foods. In addition to doing its best to allocate support from various regions, the Ministry of Commerce also needs relevant departments to find ways to plan the production of these non-staple foods near the new industrial and mining areas to facilitate supply. Only in this way can the long-term supply problems in the new industrial and mining areas be fundamentally solved.

In order to do a good job in the material supply for geological exploration teams, forest logging teams, and small independent construction units, the conference decided that these units should compile their own supply personnel, provide their own working capital and equipment, and commercial departments will designate certain supply institutions to promptly supply the commodities they need at wholesale prices.

    商业部安排秋后旺季市场供应工作
    据新华社26日讯　商业部在北京召开的全国商业厅局长会议，安排了秋后旺季市场的供应工作。
    根据今年工农业生产的情况，以及国家对农业的贷款增加、全国职工工资全面调整等方面的新情况，会议估计今年下半年全国各大中城市和广大农村市场将出现新的活跃，今年社会购买力将比去年增加15％。
    会议确定的下半年全国商业系统的任务是：调动一切有利因素，积极组织物资供应，尽可能满足人民需要，稳定市场物价。在商品供应、物价政策、组织工作、调拨储运等方面采取相应措施，以保证上述任务的完成。
    在商品供应方面，会议要求各地对某些全国性的、供不应求的、国家下半年已不可能再增加调拨的生产资料，如钢铁、五金等，应该就已有的货源积极组织供应，并且尽量注意组织废旧材料和代用品的供应。为了减轻因钢铁不足对整个市场商品供应发生的影响，商业部门应该把已掌握的钢铁尽先分配给日用百货生产加工单位。
    对城乡居民秋后普遍需要的日用百货、针棉织品和文化教育用品，应该大力推销，不应有保守惜售思想；为了做好这方面的供应工作，可以采取勤取勤运勤供应的办法。对一些长期积压的残损的变质的商品，可以适当降低价格出售。目前积压在某些县城、集镇的高级商品，要调回大中城市或工矿区供应。各地如果有不适合于当地居民需要的商品，互相之间要组织交流调剂。
    根据会议反映，不少地方最近在组织货源中发生盲目要货的现象。由于某些地区派人四出乱抓货源，人为地造成市场的紧张局面。会议认为，这种混乱情况必须加以纠正。但是各地商业部门派员到产地自由去采购小百货、非计划商品以及计划商品中通过供应会议自由认购以后有多的商品，还是可以允许的。
    会议确定的今年下半年各主要商品的供应量，比去年同期增加了很多。棉布、糖、胶鞋、自行车、火柴、毛巾、袜子、汗衫、收音机、缝纫机等商品，增加了16％到三点九倍。
    这次会议专门研究了新工矿区的供应问题。认为目前新工矿区的商业网和物资供应工作赶不上新工矿区发展的要求。为了改进新工矿区的供应工作，会议认为必须解决商业组织、商业人员、商业设置和交通运输工具等问题，请求各地党政领导机关把新工矿区商业和服务性行业的基本建设，看做生产性建设的一部分，加强领导。新工矿区最感困难的是蔬菜、肉类和其他副食品的供应，商业部除了尽力从各地调拨支援以外，大部分还需要有关部门设法在新工矿区附近规划这些副食品的生产，以利供应。而且只有这样，才能根本解决新工矿区长期的供应问题。
    为了做好地质勘探队、森林采伐队和小型单独施工单位的物资供应，会议确定由这些单位自己编制供应人员，自备流动资金和设备，商业部门将指定一定的供应机构，按批发价格及时供应他们所需要的商品。
