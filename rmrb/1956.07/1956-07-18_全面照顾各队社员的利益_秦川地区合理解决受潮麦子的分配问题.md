Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, July 16th: Party and government leading bodies in the Qin Chuan area of Shaanxi Province are holding meetings and sending cadres to help agricultural production cooperatives resolve some new problems that have arisen in the summer harvest pre-distribution. Gaoling and other counties recently held three-level cadre meetings, while Chang'an and Hu County held telephone conferences. The Baoji Special District and its counties have dispatched more than 1,200 cadres to rural areas to specifically lead this work.

This year, agricultural cooperatives in the Qin Chuan area have generally achieved a bumper wheat harvest. However, during the harvest, they suffered from rain, and some wheat fields suffered reduced yields. Therefore, in the summer harvest distribution, some cooperative members, seeing that some wheat had sprouted and become moldy, requested to receive more of the good wheat. Some production teams of agricultural cooperatives, because they harvested, transported, and milled as soon as the wheat ripened, did not suffer any damage to the wheat and requested distribution by production team. Other production teams only harvested but did not mill, and the wheat was exposed to rain on the threshing ground; these production teams requested unified distribution. Still other agricultural cooperatives did not revise their pre-distribution plans based on the disaster situation, and the public accumulation fund and public welfare fund were deducted too little or not at all during the distribution. Some cooperatives even distributed the original accumulated funds to the members, affecting future production within the cooperative. Regarding these problems, leading bodies in various places have been resolving them according to the different situations.

The meetings held in various places pointed out that when the losses between teams in agricultural cooperatives are significantly different, if it is indeed due to unreasonable division of cultivated areas and uneven distribution of labor and livestock, the good and bad grain should be mixed and distributed uniformly with the cooperative as a unit. If it is due to poor labor or inadequate rescue efforts, the shortcomings of the members of that team should be pointed out to make them recognize their mistakes. At the same time, the production teams with less losses should be educated and persuaded to proceed from solidarity so that all members can rationally distribute good and bad grain, and the teams with less losses should be appropriately taken care of. During distribution, each agricultural cooperative should give priority to retaining the good grain for seeds, and the rest should be mixed according to the proportion of public grain, purchased grain, and member distribution. Whether to distribute by production team or uniformly by the entire cooperative should be handled according to different situations. Some cooperatives can distribute by production team, and others can distribute uniformly by the cooperative.

Regarding the payment of public grain, the meetings pointed out that good grain should be used to pay good grain, and bad grain should be used to pay bad grain; those with both good and bad grain should pay public grain in proportion. This takes into account both the interests of the state and the interests of individual members. If the total income of some agricultural cooperatives has decreased, the original distribution plan and the proportion of public accumulation fund and public welfare fund should be revised.

### 全面照顾各队社员的利益  秦川地区合理解决受潮麦子的分配问题

    全面照顾各队社员的利益
    秦川地区合理解决受潮麦子的分配问题
    据新华社西安16日讯　陕西省秦川地区各地党政领导机关正在召开会议并派出干部帮助农业生产合作社解决夏收预分中所发生的一些新问题。高陵等县在最近召开了三级干部会议，长安、鄠县召开了电话会议，宝鸡专区和该专区各县派出一千二百多名干部到农村具体领导这一工作。
    秦川地区的农业社今年小麦普遍丰收，但在收获期间，遭受雨淋，部分麦田受到减产损失，因此在夏收分配中，有些社员看到部分麦子发芽和霉坏，自己要求多分好麦；有些农业社的生产队在夏收当中因为做到随黄随割，随运随碾，麦子没有受到损害，要求按生产队分配；还有些生产队光割不碾，麦子在场上受到雨淋，这些生产队要求统一分配；还有些农业社没有根据遭灾情况修订预分方案，分配的时候，公积金和公益金扣除过少或者根本没有扣除，甚至有个别社连原来的积累都分配给社员，影响今后社内的生产。对于这些问题，各地领导机关分别不同情况，加以解决。
    各地在召开的会议中指出，各农业社队与队间损失相当悬殊时，如果确因耕作区划分不合理、劳力畜力搭配不均，应以社为单位，好坏粮搭配统一分配；如果由于劳动不好、抢救不力，应向这个队的社员指出缺点，使他们认识错误，同时教育说服受损失少的生产队从团结出发，使全体社员好坏粮合理分配，并适当照顾损失小的队。在分配中，各农业社应该把好粮尽先留作籽种，其余的按照公粮、购粮、社员分配的比例，进行好坏搭配。到底是以生产队为单位分配或者全社统一分配，要根据不同情况处理。有些社可以以生产队为单位进行分配，也可以以社为单位统一分配。
    关于交纳公粮，会议指出，打好粮交好粮；打坏粮交坏粮；好粮坏粮都有的，按比例交纳公粮，这样既照顾了国家的利益，又照顾了社员个人的利益。某些农业社的总收入减少了，应当重新修订原来的分配计划和扣除公积金、公益金的比例。
