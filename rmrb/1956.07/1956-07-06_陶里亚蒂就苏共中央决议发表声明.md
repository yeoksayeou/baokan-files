Xinhua News Agency, Rome, July 4th (TASS dispatch): “The Evening Nation” published a statement by Palmiro Togliatti, General Secretary of the Italian Communist Party Central Committee, on the resolution of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, on July 3rd.

Togliatti said: "I have not yet read the full text of the CPSU Central Committee's resolution on the causes and consequences of the cult of personality. From what I know, I believe this document is a very important contribution, which helps to clarify the doubts caused in the international workers' and communist movement by the criticism of Stalin's activities put forward at the 20th Congress of the CPSU.

As for what I said in the interview that everyone knows about, perhaps the best thing to do now is to read carefully what I wrote. The policy implemented by the Soviet comrades in the cause of building a socialist society is correct, and I have no doubts about this, and I have said so publicly. However, within the scope of recognizing this, there can be different opinions regarding the significance of the errors committed during Stalin's leadership, the destruction of the rule of law, the restriction of party and Soviet democracy, and the impact of these errors on the entire economic and political development of the Soviet Union. I repeat, such differences of opinion are possible, and a sincere discussion of this issue will only benefit the development of our movement, because it is in line with greater maturity, mutual understanding, and trust. Especially because these differences of opinion do not negate, but rather affirm, my personal and our party leadership's unconditional support for the work done by the Soviet leaders in the past and present to completely eliminate the consequences of the cult of personality of Stalin in the Soviet Union and the international workers' movement."

    陶里亚蒂就苏共中央决议发表声明
    新华社5日讯　塔斯社罗马四日电：“国家晚报”七月三日刊载了意大利共产党中央委员会总书记陶里亚蒂关于苏联共产党中央委员会决议的声明。
    陶里亚蒂说：“我还没有读到苏共中央委员会关于个人崇拜的原因和后果的决议的全文。据我所知道的来说，我认为这一文件是一个十分重要的贡献，它有助于澄清因苏共二十次代表大会上提出的对斯大林的活动的批判而在国际工人和共产主义运动中引起的疑问。
    至于我在大家都知道的答记者问中所说的话，或许现在最好的做法就是仔细读一下我所写的东西。苏联同志在建设社会主义社会的事业上所执行的方针是正确的，我对这一点没有任何怀疑，我也曾公开地这样说过。但是，在承认这一点的范围之内，对于在斯大林领导时期所犯的错误，法制遭到破坏，党和苏维埃的民主受到限制等等情况的意义，以及对于这些错误对苏联的整个经济和政治的发展的影响，可以有不同的意见。我重复说一遍，这种意见上的不同是可以的，并且对这个问题的真诚的讨论只会对我们的运动发展有好处，因为这符合于更高度的成熟、相互了解和信任。尤其是因为这种意见上的不同并不否定，相反地，是肯定了我个人和我们党的领导机构无条件地拥护苏共领导人过去和现在为在苏联以及国际工人运动中完全肃清对斯大林个人崇拜的后果所做的工作。”
