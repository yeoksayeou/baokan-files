    High Moisture Content of Newly Harvested Wheat This Year:
    Henan Grain Departments Help Agricultural Cooperatives Improve Storage Work
    (Xinhua News Agency) Zhengzhou -- Grain departments in various parts of Henan Province have dispatched a large number of personnel and adopted various measures to help agricultural cooperatives actively improve grain storage work.
    According to incomplete statistics, grain departments in Anyang, Xuchang, Nanyang and other places have trained more than 10,000 grain storage personnel for agricultural cooperatives. They have also transferred several thousand grain inspectors and cadres with experience in grain storage to rural areas to provide on-site instruction on techniques for sorting, storing, and identifying grain quality.
    Grain workers from Xinxiang and Kaifeng prefectures who went to the countryside helped 1,990 agricultural cooperatives inspect their grain reserves in just over ten days.
    Henan Province experienced heavy rainfall this summer. Most of the province's more than 70 million mu of wheat were harvested and threshed in the rain. The wheat stored in agricultural cooperatives' warehouses generally had a moisture content of 16% to 20%, and temperatures reached 30 to 40 degrees Celsius. In addition, the state continued to implement a policy of increasing production without increasing procurement this year, leading to an increase in grain reserves in agricultural cooperatives. However, there were fewer warehouses and a lack of grain storage experience, resulting in mold and insect infestations in many areas. In response to this situation, Party and government leading organs and grain departments at all levels in the province have taken various measures to conscientiously guide agricultural cooperatives in carrying out activities such as inspection and sun-drying of grain, striving to avoid or reduce grain losses.

    今年收的小麦含水量大
    河南粮食部门帮助农业社改进保管工作
    据新华社讯　河南省各地粮食部门派出了大批人员，采取多种措施，帮助农业社积极改进粮食保管工作。
    据不完全统计，安阳、许昌和南阳等地的粮食部门，已经为农业社训练了粮食保管员一万多人。还抽调了几千名粮食化验员和对保管粮食有经验的干部，到农村巡回传授整理、保管与鉴别粮食质量的技术。
    新乡和开封专区下乡的粮食工作人员，在十多天中，帮助一千九百九十个农业社检查了存粮。
    河南省今年夏季多雨，全省的七千多万亩小麦，大部分是冒雨抢收抢打的，农业社仓库存放的麦子，一般含水分16％到20％，温度达三十度到四十度；再加上国家今年继续执行粮食增产不增购的政策，农业社存粮增多，但仓库少，又缺乏粮食保管经验，不少地区的麦子发生了霉变和生虫现象。针对这一情况，这个省的各地党、政领导机关和粮食部门便采取各种措施，认真领导农业合作社，开展了检查和晒粮等活动，争取避免或减少粮食损失。
