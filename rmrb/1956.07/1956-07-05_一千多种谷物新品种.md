Xinhua News Agency, 3rd: TASS reports: There are now more than two hundred research and experimental institutions in the Soviet Union engaged in the cultivation of crop varieties. During the Soviet era, they have cultivated more than a thousand new grain varieties.

    The Soviet Ministry of Agriculture has formulated measures to promote new grain varieties in collective farm production. According to the natural conditions of various regions, the country has designated specific areas to plant one hundred and sixty-two kinds of winter wheat and many other new grain varieties. High-yielding varieties have been planted on millions of hectares of land. After the widespread adoption of these new varieties, the country will be able to increase grain production by more than 500 million poods (one pood equals 32.76 jin or about 16.4 kg) per year.

    In order to universally adopt high-yielding hybrid corn varieties nationwide in the next five years, the Soviet Union has designated more than two thousand collective farms and state-owned farms to produce hybrid corn seeds for the whole country. It is estimated that after the promotion of this variety nationwide, the annual corn yield will increase by approximately 600 million poods.

    一千多种谷物新品种
    新华社3日讯　据塔斯社报道：苏联现在总共有两百多个研究和实验机构从事农作物品种的培育工作。在苏维埃政权的年代中，它们已经培育出一千多种谷物新品种。
    苏联农业部制定出了在集体农庄生产中推广谷物新品种的措施。根据各地的自然条件，全国已经划定专门的地区来种植一百六十二种冬小麦和许多其他谷物新品种。有数百万公顷的田地上种上了产量高的品种。这些新品种经广泛采用以后，每年将可以为国家增产五亿普特（每普特合三十二点七六市斤）以上的粮食。
    为了在最近五年内在全国范围内普遍采用产量高的杂交种玉蜀黍，苏联已经划出两千多个集体农庄和国营农场为全国生产杂交种玉蜀黍种子。据估计，这种品种在全国范围内推广以后，每年玉蜀黍的产量大约将增加六亿普特。
