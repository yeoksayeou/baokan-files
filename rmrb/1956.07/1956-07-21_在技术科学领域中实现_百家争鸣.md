    Achieving "Let a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend" in Technical Sciences
    Hu Weibai
    Since the "Let a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend" policy was put forward, the academic world, especially in philosophy, literature, history, and theoretical science, has immediately shown a lively atmosphere. However, in technical sciences, the reaction seems to be not enthusiastic enough. As I speculate, because the so-called "hundred schools" in the past were mostly related to philosophies of life and nature, and technical sciences, for many years, have been neglected, and considered as just some technical operations, rarely able to become "schools". Since liberation, technical sciences have been valued and greatly developed, but some people think that the current technical foundation of our country is mainly established with the help of the Soviet Union and other brother countries, and we ourselves cannot "contend" immediately. I think this view is not correct enough. The policy of "Let a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend" is to promote the enthusiasm and creativity of scientific workers, to accelerate socialist construction, and technical science directly serves production construction. In the process of construction in our country, many technical problems have emerged, which urgently need to be solved, and more technical problems will emerge in the future, waiting for workers in the technical science departments to conduct free discussions from all aspects, and to conduct experimental research from various angles, in order to solve these problems as early and as quickly as possible. Therefore, technical science will not only "let a hundred schools of thought contend" in the future, but also, due to objective needs, will become a field with the most "contention" and the fastest "formation of schools".
    In order for the technical science of our country to meet the needs of production development and to quickly catch up with the world level, I think there are three points that are worth noting when implementing the "Let a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend" policy.
    First, a large-scale competition in experimental research work should be launched in the field of technical science. With the development of industrial construction, many major and complex technical problems (such as the comprehensive utilization of resources, the trial manufacture of new products, the adoption of new technologies, etc.) are constantly emerging. To solve these problems quickly and well, it is absolutely necessary to conduct experimental research from all aspects. To attack the fortress of a technical problem, there can be many plans in strategy and tactics. Before the work, it is necessary to solicit various plans, and when deploying the work, several well-founded plans should be selected to advance simultaneously, so that victory will be guaranteed. However, at present, for some complex and major technical problems, only a small number of people in a certain research institution are entrusted to lead, and others do not actively raise their opinions. Especially in departments with Soviet experts, often as soon as the expert expresses an opinion, a decision is immediately made, and some people have different views and supplements to the experimental methods and steps, but they are not fully expressed. Some of them were said, but did not receive enough attention and concrete support in terms of manpower and material resources. Especially for the opinions put forward by technical personnel who have studied in capitalist countries, sometimes they are arbitrarily labeled as "capitalist methods" without analysis, which easily makes these people passively watch and cannot enthusiastically and actively come together to think of solutions. In ancient China, there was a method of "rewarding for solutions", and many technologically advanced countries in modern times often have a method of "rewarding for solutions" (such as the Soviet Ministry of Nonferrous Metals Industry's suspended problems this year include "mineral processing of a certain copper-zinc mine", "process improvement of a certain mercury smelting plant", etc., with a top prize of 20,000 rubles for each question, as well as second and third prizes, etc., and individuals or collectives from various research institutions, factories, mines, and schools can apply). I think this method is worth considering by industrial departments. For any individual, collective, or unit, as long as the experimental research program they propose has a certain basis, it should be carefully considered, and then given the necessary manpower and material support respectively, so as to carry out a competition in experimental research. This competition is not a competition, but a friendly competition, and mutual cooperation should be carried out in the competition process. At the end of the competition, the winners are certainly glorious, and other units or individuals who have participated in the work will also gain improvement from it.
    Secondly, for major technical direction issues in my country's industrial construction, free discussions should be organized. As the old saying goes, "The benevolent see benevolence, and the wise see wisdom." There are often different views on technical direction issues. For example, there are many different views on the method of mineral processing of poor iron ore in my country, the development direction of steelmaking in my country, and the method of using high-silicon aluminum ore to refine aluminum in my country. If these views can be organized and published for discussion, and then some experimental research can be done, it will be beneficial to the construction cause. Some people think that launching these possibly endless discussions will cause ideological confusion and delay the speed of construction. I don't think it will. Because we have the advanced example of the Soviet Union, some technical problems can be solved by constructing according to Soviet experience, but since technology is advancing rapidly, some of the specific problems in our country may not be exactly the same as those in the Soviet Union. Giving full play to our own strength and looking at the problems from all aspects is not only not contradictory to the speed of construction, but also guarantees the practicality and advancement of our country's construction technology.
    Third, we must support theoretical research in technical experiments and encourage various theoretical hypotheses to be put forward on the basis of reliable experiments. Due to the fact that technical science is more directly related to production, coupled with the urgent need for construction in our country, industrial departments often raise some problems in the production process to technical science and require them to be solved within a limited time. Therefore, technical science research departments often concentrate all their efforts on doing those large-scale experimental works that are very similar to production conditions and are mechanically methodical. This is an objective need and should be done. However, from a long-term and fundamental point of view, in order to advance technology to new heights and solve problems more thoroughly, it is necessary to devote some efforts to theoretical research. Starting from concrete phenomena, simplifying some complex conditions and conducting some more abstract research, studying various conditions clearly separately, and then gradually studying their interrelationships, and finally returning to concrete problems to guide practice. This is the common method of scientific research and understanding things. However, at present, there is this tendency: If you want to study, you must solve the problems of design or production within a limited time. The theoretical study of technical problems will be considered "nitpicking" and "divorced from reality". If these theoretical studies require more complex instruments and a longer time, they will also be labeled with the hat of "not being able to meet the requirements of construction". This phenomenon is worth noting and overcoming.
    On the other hand, there is still this situation now: after a large number of experimental studies, submitting a thick report is considered enough. If the design and construction departments use some figures, they are satisfied. As for the new situations discovered in the experimental process, the connection of many objective internal laws, they are not deeply noticed. In other words, there is a lack of theoretical exploration. What is even more worth noting is that when some authors attempt to put forward some hypotheses, others will "criticize" them, saying that "the data is insufficient," "experimental data is materialistic, while inferring hypotheses is arbitrary inference and idealistic." This makes experimenters dare not put forward hypotheses, that is to say, dare not "contend". In fact, in the process of scientific thinking development, "hypothesis" plays a considerable role. We should encourage technical science workers to put forward theoretical "hypotheses" after sufficient experimental research, after new situations are observed, and after careful and meticulous analysis and consideration, rather than so-called "bold hypotheses" without any basis. Through the debate of theoretical research and theoretical hypotheses, the level of technical science will be rapidly improved.
    The Party Central Committee's proposal of the "Let a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend" policy vividly illustrates the true freedom of scholarship under the socialist system and provides conditions for the rapid development of scholarship. With the development of socialist construction in our country, under the kind care of the Party and the enthusiastic expectations of the people, the technical science of our country will surely flourish. In the near future, our country will get rid of the situation of technical backwardness and be listed among the world's advanced countries with an unprecedented technical level.

    在技术科学领域中实现“百家争鸣”
    胡为柏
    “百家争鸣”的方针提出以后，在学术界特别在哲学、文学、史学以及理论科学方面，立刻呈现了活跃气象。但是在技术科学方面，反应似乎还不够热烈。据我揣测，因为过去所谓“诸子百家”，多半是有关人生哲理和自然方面的，而技术科学，许多年来，一直就被忽视，被认为不过是一些技术操作，很少能成“家”。解放以来，技术科学是被重视了，并且大大发展了，但是有人以为目前我国的技术基础，主要是在苏联和其他兄弟国家帮助下建立的，我们自己一下子还“鸣”不起来。我觉得这种看法是不够正确的。“百家争鸣”的方针是为了发扬科学工作者的积极性和创造性，来加速社会主义的建设，而技术科学是直接为生产建设服务的。在我国建设过程中，已经出现了许多技术问题，迫切需要解决，将来还会出现更多的技术问题，等待着技术科学部门的工作者从各方面进行自由讨论，从各种角度去试验研究，以求尽早尽快地解决这些问题。所以技术科学不仅在今后要“百家争鸣”，而且由于客观需要，还会成为“争鸣”最多，“成家”最快的一个领域。
    为了我国技术科学能够适合生产发展的需要，并且迅速地赶上世界水平，在实现“百家争鸣”方针的时候，我想有三点是值得注意的。
    首先，要在技术科学领域中开展试验研究工作的大竞赛。随着工业建设的发展，许多重大而复杂的技术问题（如资源的综合利用、新产品的试制、新技术的采用等）不断涌现。要把这些问题解决得又快又好，就完全有必要从各方面来进行试验研究。向一个技术问题的堡垒进攻，在战略和战术上可以有许多方案。工作之先有必要征求各种方案，在布置工作的时候还应该选取好几个有根据的方案齐头并进，胜利才会有把握。但是目前对于一些复杂重大的技术问题，只交给某一研究机构少数人去领导，其他人有意见也不积极提。特别是在有苏联专家的部门，往往专家一发表意见，立刻就做了决定，有人对于试验的方法、步骤有不同的看法和补充，也没有充分说出来。有些说出来了，也没有得到足够的重视和人力物力的具体支持。特别对于留学资本主义国家的技术人员所提的意见，有时候没有经过分析，就被武断地贴上“资本主义国家的办法”的标签，这就很容易使这些人消极旁观，不能热烈而积极地来一起想办法。在我国古代，就有过“悬赏求解”的办法，而现代的许多技术先进国家，经常有“悬赏求解”的办法（如苏联有色金属工业部今年的悬赏问题就有“某铜锌矿的选矿”、“某炼汞厂流程改进”等，每一题的头奖是两万卢布，还有二奖、三奖等，凡各研究机关、厂矿、学校的个人或者集体都可以应征），我认为这一办法很值得工业部门考虑。对于任何个人、集体或者单位，只要他们提出的试验研究方案有一定的根据，就应该慎重地加以考虑，然后分别给以必要的人力和物力的支持，从而开展试验研究的竞赛。这种竞赛不是竞争，而是友谊的竞赛，在竞赛过程中要相互配合。竞赛结束的时候，获赏者固然光荣，其它参加过工作的单位或者个人，也会从中获得提高。
    其次，对于我国工业建设中重大的技术方向问题，应该有组织地开展自由讨论。古话说，“仁者见仁，智者见智”，对于技术方向的问题，常常有不同的看法。譬如说我国贫铁矿的选矿方法问题，我国炼钢的发展方向问题，对于利用我国高矽铝矿炼铝方法的问题等等，各方面就有许多不同的看法。如果能够有组织地把这些看法发表出来，进行讨论，然后做一些试验研究，对建设事业是有利的。有人认为开展了这些可能是无休止的讨论，会造成思想混乱以致会延误建设速度。我认为并不会这样。因为我们有苏联先进的榜样，有些技术问题可以先根据苏联经验进行建设，但是由于技术是在日新月异地进步，我国的一些具体问题同苏联未必完全相同，充分发挥我们自己的力量，从各方面来看问题，不仅同建设速度不矛盾，并且还会保证我国建设技术的现实性和先进性。
    第三，要赞助技术试验中的理论研究，鼓励在可靠的实验的基础上，提出各种的理论假说。由于技术科学同生产联系比较直接的这一特点，加上我国建设的迫切需要，产业部门往往对技术科学提出一些生产过程中的问题，要限期解决。所以技术科学研究部门往往集中全部力量做那些同生产条件很相近的、工作量很大的、方法上很机械的试验工作。这是客观需要，是应该做的。但是从长远和根本来看，为了使技术向新的境界推进并且比较彻底地解决问题，有必要分出一部分力量做些理论的研究。从具体现象出发，把一些复杂条件简化而进行一些较抽象的研究，把各种条件单独研究清楚以后，再逐步研究它们的相互联系，最后又回到具体问题上来指导实践。这本是科学研究和认识事物的普通方法。但是目前就有这种倾向：你要研究吗？就要限期解决设计或者生产上的问题，对于技术问题的理论钻研，会被认为“钻牛角尖”、“脱离实际”，如果这些理论研究需要比较复杂的仪器和比较长的时间，还会被扣上“不能适合建设要求”的帽子。这种现象是值得注意克服的。
    另一方面，现在还有这种情况，在进行大量的试验研究以后，提出一份厚厚的报告就算了。设计建设部门如果用上了一些数字，也就满意了。至于对在试验过程中发现的新的情况，许多客观内在规律的联系情况，就不深入加以注意了。换句话说，就是缺乏理论上的探索。还有更值得注意的，就是有些作者企图提出一些假说时，其他人就会进行“批评”，说什么“数据不足”，“实验数据是唯物的，而推论假说是妄自推断，是唯心的。”这就使得试验者不敢提出假说，也就是说不敢“鸣”。实际上在科学思唯发展过程中。“假说”是起相当作用的，我们应该鼓励技术科学工作者在经过充分的试验研究以后，在新的情况被观察到以后，经过慎重细致的分析考虑，然后提出理论“假说”，而不是毫无根据的所谓“大胆的假说”。通过理论研究和理论假说的争辩，技术科学的水平就会迅速地提高。
    党中央提出“百家争鸣”的方针，生动地说明了社会主义制度下学术的真正自由，提供了学术迅速发展的条件。随着我国社会主义建设的发展，在党的亲切关怀和人民热烈期望下的我国技术科学，一定会兴旺茂盛起来。在不久的将来，我国将摆脱技术落后的情况，而以空前的技术水平列入世界先进国家的行列。
