    Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 9th - The advanced experience imparted by Soviet advanced producers to Shenyang mechanical workers has blossomed and borne fruit.
    In the "Advanced Experience Study Class" of the Shenyang No. 1 Machine Tool Plant, lathe operator Zhang Lianjiang mastered the high-speed precision turning experience of Shummilin, a high-speed lathe operator from the "Red Proletarian" factory in Moscow, in just over ten days, increasing the production efficiency of internal hole turning by more than three times. The face milling cutters and end milling cutters of Lelyonov, a Soviet advanced producer and milling worker from the Kirov factory in Leningrad, have been widely welcomed and valued by milling workers in Shenyang machinery factories. The Shenyang Air Compressor Factory has organized three or four advanced technology demonstration meetings of face milling cutters and end milling cutters, so that many milling workers have mastered the milling experience of these milling cutters, and the production efficiency has been increased by two to three times. Milling worker Li Jikun used Leonov's face milling cutter to cut off the "connecting rod," increasing efficiency by more than four times. When the Soviet machine manufacturing advanced producer delegation visited Shenyang in early May, workers from more than ten state-owned machinery factories in Shenyang learned the advanced experience they imparted. Now, the number of workers who have mastered these advanced experiences has increased from more than 40 to hundreds.

    友谊的种子开花结果
    新华社沈阳9日电　沈阳机械工人学习苏联先进生产者传授的先进经验，已经开花结果。
    在沈阳第一机床厂“先进经验研究班”里，车工张连江只用十多天的工夫就熟练地掌握了苏联先进生产者、莫斯科“红色无产者”工厂高速车工舒米林的高速精车经验，车内孔的生产效率提高了三倍多。苏联先进生产者、列宁格勒基洛夫工厂铣工列里诺夫的片铣刀和端铣刀，受到沈阳机械工厂铣工们的普遍欢迎和重视。沈阳空气压缩机厂曾经组织了三、四次片铣刀和端铣刀的先进技术表演会，使很多铣工掌握了这种铣刀的铣削经验，生产效率提高了两倍到三倍。铣工李际昆利用里昂诺夫的片铣刀切断“连杆”，提高效率四倍以上。苏联机器制造业先进生产者代表团，五月上旬来沈阳访问的时候，沈阳有十多个国营机械工厂的工人学习了他们传授的先进经验。现在，掌握这些先进经验的工人，已经由当初四十多人增加到数百人。
