    Behind the Dazzling Paris
    As we were about to leave Paris, our French friends asked us again, "You've been here for a month. How do you understand Paris?" We said, "We can only repeat what we said a month ago: the deepest impression we have is of the people of Paris."

    Parisians are life-loving, frank, and hospitable. The dazzling Paris I have seen is not the entirety of Paris; it is only a small part. We will not talk about the French people's great contributions to culture and science, nor about the Parisians' goodwill towards us, which they express everywhere. I will only speak of the small number of ordinary people I encountered who are creating the real life of Paris. Their voices and expressions I will never forget. The devout Catholics, the ordinary artists, the waitresses in small cafes, the telephone operators in hotels... Life and common sense have gradually forced them to pay attention to issues they previously did not notice or want to notice. The French people understand too well what war is, whether it is the memory of the humiliation of the days when Hitler ruled France, or the disgusting taste of canned food after the war, or the deficit on the monthly and annual household accounts, or the decline of their own industry, from different angles, they feel: "This doesn't seem right; maybe there really needs to be another way." Many honest intellectuals are seriously thinking about the issues. I personally met an intellectual who had not asked about politics for more than twenty years. His Catholic faith had always kept him from touching these matters, but he felt some issues from his own family affairs, which led him to ask me some questions. A congenial artist from afar also couldn't help but tell me with deep meaning but doubt: "It seems there will have to be some changes. Everything seems to be somewhat different from what I thought before." So, even during our short stay in Paris, we saw debates about colonial issues in the newspapers every day. On some days, the news that newly enlisted soldiers refused to depart for Africa shocked the leisurely Parisians; we received a printed request for signatures initiated by a member of parliament to "Recognize China"; the most famous individualistic writer wrote a play that caused a sensation in Paris against the "Cold War"...

    There is a popular song called "Paris will always be Paris." But Paris is not just that dazzling Paris. In our memory, Paris is also the Paris of lively, cordial, and friendly ordinary Parisians. (Attached picture)

    欧游散记

    〔十〕
    在五光十色的巴黎的后面
    当我们要离开巴黎的时候，我们的法国朋友又问我们：“你们已经住了一个月了，你们怎么了解巴黎呢？”我们说：“我们还只能重复一个月以前的话，给我们最深的印象的还是巴黎人民”。
    巴黎人是热爱生活的、坦率好客的。在我已经看到的那个五色缤纷的巴黎，那不是全部的巴黎，那只是巴黎的一小部分。我们且不说法国人民对文化、科学的伟大贡献，也不要说巴黎人民处处表露出来的对我们的好意。我只说我接触过的极少数的那些创造着真正的巴黎生活的普通的人们中间，他们的声音和表情我将永远不会忘记。虔诚的天主教徒，普通的艺术家，小咖啡店的招待员，旅馆的电话接线生……生活和常识已经渐渐地迫使他们注意一些他们从前所不注意也不愿注意的问题了。法国人民太了解什么是战争了，希特勒统治法国时的屈辱的日子的记忆也好，战后那些令人生厌的罐头食品的味道也好，每月、每年家庭簿记上的赤字也好，自己从事的行业的衰落也好，各个不同的角度都使他们感到：“这样好像不行，也许真的要有别的办法才好”。不少正直的知识分子在认真地思索着问题。我便亲自遇见过一位二十多年不问政治的知识分子，他的天主教的信仰使他从来也不去接触这些事情，但是，他从自己家事中也感觉到了一些问题，使他来问我一些事情。一个谈得来的远道来的艺术家也不禁有深意地但是疑惑地告诉我：“看来总要有些变化才行。一切好像是和我从前所想的有些不同了。”所以就在我们停留在巴黎的短短的日子里，我们也看到报纸上每天都有关于殖民地问题的辩论。有些日子，新入伍的士兵拒绝出发到非洲去的新闻震动着悠闲的巴黎人；我们收到一位国会议员发起的“承认中国”的征求签名的印刷品；最有名的个人主义的作家写了一个轰动巴黎的反对“冷战”的剧本……。
    有一首流行歌曲叫“巴黎永远是巴黎”。但巴黎不仅只是那个五色缤纷的巴黎，在我们的记忆中，巴黎还是那个生气勃勃、殷勤友好的普通巴黎人的巴黎。（附图片）
