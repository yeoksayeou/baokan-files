*Post-Editing Musings*

	The Harbin Municipal Real Estate Administration organized 3,000 households to exchange residences, resolving the contradiction of homes being too far from workplaces. This is truly a good thing.

	There is an unreasonable phenomenon in railway freight work called "cross-transport." In urban public transportation, there is also an unreasonable phenomenon: human "cross-transport." Organization A is in the east of the city, and its dormitories are in the west; Organization B is in the west, and its dormitories are in the east. Staff commute "crosswise" every day, and the losses in time and transportation capacity are incalculable. Everyone sees that this is unreasonable. The idea of ​​"exchanging residences" has also been raised, but no one has organized it.

	It is hoped that the real estate management agencies in various cities will learn from Harbin's experience and change this unreasonable situation.

	"Ostrich" ink used to not be a particularly popular product, but now it is rated as first-class ink. What is the reason for this? It turns out that the Tianjin Ink Factory, which produces "Ostrich" ink, learned from the production experience of domestic "Minsheng" ink and absorbed the advantages of imported "Parker," "Waterman," and other better-quality inks.

	"Minsheng" is domestic ink, and its experience should of course be learned. "Parker" is American ink. Is it right to learn from their experience? Answer: Yes. The good experience of all countries should be learned, and it should be learned well.

	A trolleybus in Shanghai caught fire after being struck by lightning on July 2, resulting in injuries. This is an unfortunate incident.

	Many cities have trolleybuses, and many people ride them several times a day. Trolleybuses are closely related to the people's lives. The public utilities bureaus and trolleybus companies in various cities need to learn from this lesson and check whether the lightning arresters on each carriage are truly effective.

    ·编后杂感·
    哈尔滨市房地产管理局组织三千户居民互换住宅，解决了住宅与工作地址相距过远的矛盾，真是件好事。
    铁路货运工作中有一种不合理的现象，就是“对流运输”。而城市里的公共交通事业中，也有一种不合理的现象，这就是人的“对流运输”。甲机关在东城，宿舍在西城；乙机关在西城，宿舍在东城。工作人员天天“对流”，时间的损失，运输力的损失，不可计算。这，大家也看出是不合理的。“互换住宅”的意见，也曾有人提过，可是，就是没有人加以组织。
    希望各个城市的房地产管理机关，学习哈尔滨的经验，改变这种不合理的情况。
    “鸵鸟”墨水过去并不是什么特别受人欢迎的产品，现在被评为第一流的墨水了。这是什么原因呢？原来是生产“鸵鸟”墨水的天津市墨水厂，学习了国内“民生”墨水的生产经验，吸取进口的“派克”，“瓦特曼”等质量较好的墨水的优点。
    “民生”是国内的墨水，它的经验当然应该学习。“派克”是美国墨水，学它们的经验对不对呢？答：对。一切国家好的经验都应该学，而且要好好地学。
    上海市一辆电车七月二日在雷雨中遇击起火，发生伤人事故，这是件不幸的事情。
    许多城市都有电车，许多人一天要乘几回电车。电车之与人民生活，关系至密。各个城市的公用事业局和电车公司，都有必要吸取这个教训，检查一下每节车厢的避雷器是否确有实效。
