Xinhua News Agency, New York, July 4th (TASS dispatch) The United Nations Disarmament Commission began its meeting here on July 3rd to discuss the report of the Disarmament Subcommittee. The subcommittee held a meeting in London from March 19th to May 4th this year.

    British representative Nutting, on behalf of the governments of the United Kingdom, the United States, France, and Canada, submitted a proposal reaffirming the general principles in the statement made by the representatives of the Western countries on May 4th this year. It advocated that the solution to the disarmament issue depends on the "resolution of important political issues" and the realization of an aerial inspection plan.

    U.S. representative Lodge, in his speech, placed the aerial inspection plan in the first priority. He said that the Western countries would consider any agreement on disarmament from the perspective of "the effectiveness of implementation of supervision."

    Soviet representative Gromyko, in his speech, stated the Soviet government's position on the disarmament issue. He pointed out that the Western countries are currently beginning to regress, both on the issue of the level of armed forces of major powers and on a series of other issues. All these facts have complicated the disarmament negotiations and made it virtually impossible to reach an agreement on the disarmament issue, either in its entirety or in its individual parts.

    Gromyko said that if any further evidence is needed to prove what attitude the Western countries are taking on the disarmament issue, then this evidence is the proposal submitted by the British representative to the committee for discussion today. The main intention of this proposal is to effectively remove the disarmament issue from the agenda until other outstanding international political issues are resolved. Needless to say, the Soviet Union cannot agree to this attitude. The resolution of the disarmament issue cannot depend on the resolution of other issues. This proposal is not in the interest of disarmament and violates the demands of the people of all countries to end the arms race.

    Gromyko emphasized that, under the current circumstances, it is necessary to take concrete and practical actions to reduce armed forces and stop the arms race, especially for major powers to do so. The Soviet Union has taken the lead in deciding to reduce its armed forces by 1.2 million people. The Soviet Union hopes that other countries will also take measures to promote the resolution of the disarmament issue. Gromyko also pointed out the important significance of banning atomic weapons.

    Gromyko then put forward a draft declaration of countries on consolidating world peace and security for the meeting to consider. The draft stipulates that the United Nations General Assembly (Security Council) declares that all United Nations member states, in order to maintain peace and the security of all peoples, now solemnly undertake the obligation: not to use force or the threat of force in their international relations, nor to use atomic and hydrogen weapons. The United Nations General Assembly (Security Council) also calls on all other non-United Nations member states in the world to support this declaration.

    The Soviet representative pointed out that accepting this proposal would be an important step in freeing mankind from the threat of atomic war and would help reach an agreement on a complete ban on nuclear weapons.

    French representative Moch then spoke, defending the attitude of the Western countries.

    The meeting passed a resolution deciding to hear the opinions of the Indian representative on the issue of banning nuclear weapons testing and an armistice at the next meeting.

    The next meeting is scheduled to be held on July 5th.

    联合国裁军委员会举行会议
    葛罗米柯斥西方国家阻挠裁军
    新华社据塔斯社纽约4日讯  联合国裁军委员会七月三日在这里开始举行会议，讨论裁军小组委员会的报告，小组委员会今年三月十九日到五月四日在伦敦举行了会议。
    英国代表纳丁代表英国、美国、法国和加拿大四国政府提出一项提案，重申今年五月四日西方国家代表的声明中的一般原则，主张裁军问题的解决取决于“重要政治问题的解决”和空中视察计划的实现。
    美国代表洛奇在发言中把空中视察计划提到首要地位。他说，西方国家将从“实行监督的效果”这个观点来考虑关于裁军的任何协定。
    苏联代表葛罗米柯在发言中表明了苏联政府在裁军问题上的立场。他指出，不论在大国武装部队水平的问题上，还是在其他一系列问题上，西方国家目前都在开始倒退。所有这些事实使裁军谈判更加复杂化了，并且使裁军问题无论从整个方面或者是在它的个别部分都实际上失去了达成协议的可能。
    葛罗米柯说，如果还需要一个证据来证明西方国家在裁军问题上究竟采取怎样的态度，那么这个证据就是英国代表今天提交委员会讨论的提案。这个提案的主要意图是在解决其他悬而未决的国际政治问题之前，把裁军问题从议程上实际取消，不用说，苏联是不能同意这种态度的。裁军问题的解决不能够取决于其他问题的解决。这个提案是不符合裁军利益的，并且违背各国人民希望终止扩充军备的要求。
    葛罗米柯强调说，在当前的情况下，须要对裁减武装部队和停止扩充军备采取具体的、切实可行的行动，特别是须要大国这样做。苏联已经率先决定裁减武装部队一百二十万人，苏联希望其他国家也将采取措施来促进解决裁军问题。葛罗米柯还指出禁止原子武器的重要意义。
    葛罗米柯接着提出了各国关于巩固世界和平和安全的宣言草案，供会议考虑。草案里规定，联合国大会（安全理事会）宣布，所有联合国会员国为维护和平和各国人民的安全，现在庄严地承担义务：在它们的国际关系中不使用武力或武力威胁，也不使用原子武器和氢武器。联合国大会（安全理事会）并且号召世界上其他所有非联合国会员国支持这个宣言。
    苏联代表指出，接受这项建议就是在使人类摆脱原子战争威胁方面的一个重要步骤，并且有助于就完全禁止核子武器达成协议。
    法国代表莫克接着发言，为西方国家的态度辩护。
    会议通过了一项决议，决定在下一次会议上听取印度代表关于禁止核子武器试验和军备休战问题的意见。
    下次会议定在七月五日举行。
