    Rembrandt's Etched Portraits
    Situ Qiao

    This is a 1631 etching "Old Man in Contemplation" by the great 17th-century Dutch painter Rembrandt. His superb technique opened a new era for modern etching art. He took the achievements of his predecessors a big step forward. For example, this portrait of an old man is so lifelike. Looking at this old man, he seems to be thinking of some unpleasant things, tightening his brow and wrinkling the lines on his forehead. The sparse, messy hair on his head and the gray beard under his cheeks are fluttering, as if a breeze is blowing. We feel that this old man is standing there alive, just like many old people we know.
    Rembrandt's etched portraits, like his oil portraits, highlight the subject with strong contrasts of light and dark. The old man is depicted in strong light and shadow. Because the levels of light and shadow are fully and appropriately expressed, the image, ingeniously combined and organized with dots, extremely fine lines, fine lines, and thick lines, is so complete. In the painter's hands, even the tips of the old man's hair are full of life.
    Once the etching pen is down, it cannot be changed, which is generally thought to limit the freedom of expression. But Rembrandt used it to capture the rapidly changing real objects, and even used it for portraits where a hair's breadth of difference makes a world of difference. This is absolutely impossible if the sketch is not accurate enough.
    To paint such a portrait, skilled sketching is important, but keen observation is even more essential. In such a small portrait, the inner world and facial expressions of the character can be expressed; in the simple black and white picture, the sense of color is very rich, and the flexible brushstrokes form a black and white symphony, which fully possesses the completeness of oil painting, but also maintains the freshness of a sketch. These are the unique features of Rembrandt's etched portraits.
    However, these things were not easy for him to come by. A relatively complex etching composition would take him a year or two to deliberate and revise (his "Christ Healing the Sick" took three years). Even after signing a small portrait, he often had to add three or four more strokes. Even if it was just a few strokes, he wouldn't let go until he had fully achieved the desired effect. In his early works, it was common to change several copper plates for a small head.
    This is how Rembrandt worked. (Attached picture)

    伦勃朗的腐蚀版肖像画 
    司徒乔
    这是荷兰十七世纪的大画家伦勃朗在1631年作的腐蚀版画“沉思中的老人像”。他的卓越技巧给近代腐蚀版画艺术开辟了新纪元。他把前人的成就推进了一大步。例如这幅老人像，就是画得如此栩栩如生。看这老人，似乎正想到一些不愉快的事情而锁紧了眉心，蹙起了额上的皱纹，头上稀疏的乱发和腮下灰白的胡须都在飘动，好像有微风拂过。我们感觉到这老人活生生的待在那里，就像我们所认识的许多老人一样。
    伦勃朗的腐蚀版肖像，和他的油绘肖像一样，是以强烈的光和暗的对比来把主题突出的。老人在强烈的光影中被刻画出来。因为充分和适当地表现了光和阴影部分的层次，所以用点、用极细线、细线和粗线巧妙地结合组织起来的形象是这么完整。在画家笔下，老人头发的末梢都充满了生命。
    腐蚀版下笔便不能更改，一般都因此以为表现的自由不免受到限制。但伦勃朗却用他来捉取飞速幻变中的现实物象，甚至用它来作失之厘毫、便差之千里的肖像画，如果素描不够准确，这是绝对办不到的。
    要画成这么一个肖像，熟练的素描固然重要，敏锐的观察尤不可少。在这么一幅小小的肖像画里，能表现人物的内心世界和面部表情；在单纯的黑白画面里，色感却非常丰富，灵活的笔触，组成黑白的交响乐，完全具备了油画的完整性，却又保持住速写的新鲜感，这些都是伦勃朗腐蚀版肖像画独到之处。
    不过这些东西，在他也真得来不易，一幅比较复杂的腐蚀版构图，固然要花上一年两年的工夫来推敲修补（他的“基督为患者治病”画了三年），一个小肖像，在签了名之后，往往也还要添补三四次，就是只有几笔，也得非完全达到预期效果不放手。在初期作品中，为一个小头像换上几块铜版是寻常事。
    伦勃朗就是这样工作的。（附图片）
