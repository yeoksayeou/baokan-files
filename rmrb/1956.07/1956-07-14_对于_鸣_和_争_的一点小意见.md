    A Few Humble Opinions on "Letting a Hundred Flowers Bloom" and "Contending"
    Mao Dun

    For academic researchers to freely discuss based on their own perspectives is called "Letting a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend." This "school" can be plural; the plural "schools" means that this faction of scholars who are "reasonable in their arguments and have grounds for their claims" share common characteristics and viewpoints in academic research. This "school" can also be singular; the singular "school" means that a certain scholar has unique and "reasonable" insights in academic research, and he is also "justified in his arguments." Such a scholar is said to "establish his own school of thought."

    However, it cannot be inferred from this that those who have not "established their own school of thought" are not entitled to participate in "Letting a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend."

    A "school" is not born. A "school" is gradually established through continuous "blooming." A "school" cannot be self-proclaimed. A "school" is ultimately recognized by the public through continuous "blooming."

    Therefore, under the policy of "Letting a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend," we hope to see both those who have already become a "school" and those who have not yet become a "school" actively contend; we look forward to all fields open to contention being unconditionally open.

    On the other hand, we also hope that all "blooming" will be "reasonable and justified." Those who "bloom" should have a serious sense of responsibility and a pragmatic attitude. All "blooming" should also not deviate from the recognized achievements of science today. If someone today still talks about what Zou Yan did of exaggerating the Great Nine Continents (this is a metaphor), then it can only be said that they are daydreaming. This is completely irrelevant to establishing one's own school of thought!

    There was a man named Hu Huaichen, who groundlessly used his arbitrary "textual research method" to insist that Mozi was an Indian. He insisted on his "discovery" and refused to admit defeat to any criticism. Such an attitude of "contention" is not what we should welcome. Such a "school of thought" will not benefit the development of academics.

    Here, I am reminded of President Guo Moruo's saying that we must bloom well and contend well. I believe that President Guo's words should be understood in a pragmatic way, and should not be regarded as a "restriction" on "blooming" and "contending."

    对于“鸣”和“争”的一点小意见
    茅盾
    学术研究工作者，各就其所见，展开自由讨论，这叫做“百家争鸣”。这个“家”可以是多数；多数的“家”，就是说这一派的“言之成理、持之有故”的学者们在学术研究上有他们的共同的特点和观点。这个“家”也可以是少数；少数的“家”，就是说某一学者在学术研究上有他的独特的“言之成理”的见解，而且他又是“持之有故”的。这样的学者，叫做“成一家言”。
    然而不能由此推论，谓没有“成一家言”者，即不得与于“百家争鸣”之列。
    “家”不是生而成的。“家”是“鸣”之不已而逐渐确立起来的。“家”亦不能自封。“家”又是“鸣”之不已而最后获得公认的。
    因此，在“百家争鸣”的方针下，我们希望看到已经成为“家”的，和尚未成为“家”的都踊跃争鸣；我们盼望所有的可供争鸣的园地都无条件地开放。
    另一方面，我们也希望，凡有所“鸣”，必“言之有理，持之有故。”“鸣”者要有严肃的责任感，要有实事求是的态度。凡有所“鸣”，亦应当不背于今日科学所达到的公认成果。谁要是在今天还像邹衍那样侈谈什么大九洲，（这是比方），那就只能说是白日作梦。这和成一家言，完全是风马牛！
    曾有胡怀琛其人，毫无根据地、用他的随心所欲的“考证法”硬说墨翟是印度人。他坚持自己的“发见”，不向任何责难认输。这样的“争鸣”态度，也不是我们应当欢迎的。这样的“一家言”，对于学术的发展，也不会有好处。
    在这里，我想起郭沫若院长说的要鸣得好，争得好。我以为应当实事求是地去理解郭院长的话，而不应当认为是对于“鸣”和“争”的“限制”。
