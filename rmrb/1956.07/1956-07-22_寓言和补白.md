    Fables and Fillers
    Opening the July issue of "People's Literature," the table of contents includes novels, plays, features... and finally a section called "Fillers." Listed in this section are "Fables." This is somewhat puzzling. Why can't fables be listed as a separate section like novels, plays, features...? What kind of literary form is "Filler"? What does it include? Does it mean that fables can only be fillers? If these four fables were all works by famous writers, perhaps the editors wouldn't have put them in the filler section?

    寓言和补白　　　
    干预
    翻开七月号的“人民文学”，目录里有小说，剧本，特写……最后有一栏是“补白”。列入这一栏都是“寓言”。这就使人有点不解了。为什么寓言就不能像小说，剧本，特写……等单列成一栏。“补白”是文艺形式的哪一类？它包括些什么？难道寓言只能当补白吗？假若这四篇寓言都是名作家的作品，恐怕编者不把它放在补白栏吧？
