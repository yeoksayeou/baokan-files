Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, July 23rd. The Shenyang Bridge Factory has successfully trial-produced a type of "floating whale" for the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge project. In the past, bridge builders working on the water dreamed of working on a "floating plain." Now, this dream is about to become a reality.

This "floating whale" is rectangular, welded from copper plates and angle steel, with a volume of more than forty-six cubic meters and a "back" of nearly twenty-six square meters. If several "floating whales" are connected on the water, they become a "floating plain."

This "floating whale" can carry thirty-seven tons. Placed on the water, it can be used to store bridge-building materials such as steel beams and cement. Workers can also operate cranes and automobiles on it for various water operations. The belly of the "floating whale" can be filled with water. Workers operating on the water can adjust the height of the "floating whale" above the water surface by controlling the amount of water inside.

Besides being used for bridge construction, this "floating whale" has many other uses. Placed on the water next to a wharf, it can be used for loading and unloading goods. Several "floating whales" can be joined together to form a pontoon bridge for vehicles. If water power generation equipment is installed in the abdomen of the "floating whale" and control equipment is installed on its back, it becomes a hydroelectric power station.

In August, the first batch of dozens of trial-produced "floating whales" will be shipped to the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge construction site.

The "floating whale" is a product that the Soviet Union successfully trial-produced in 1953. With the help of Soviet experts, the workers of the Shenyang Bridge Factory began trial production last winter. Now, they can produce a "floating whale" on average every three days.

### 建桥工人的“水上平原”

    建桥工人的“水上平原”
    新华社沈阳23日电　沈阳桥梁厂为武汉长江大桥架桥工程试制成功了一种“浮鲸”。过去，在水上作业的建桥工人，曾经梦想过能在“水上平原”上工作，现在，这个梦想就要变成现实了。
    这种“浮鲸”是长方形的，用铜板和三角钢焊成，体积有四十六立方公尺多，鲸背将近二十六平方公尺。如果把几个“浮鲸”接连起来放在水上，就成为“水上平原”了。
    这种“浮鲸”可以载重三十七吨。把它放在水上，可以用来放置钢梁、水泥等架桥器材，工人们还可以在上面驾起重机和汽车，进行各种水上作业。“浮鲸”肚子里面可以装水。在水上作业的工人，可以根据需要用装水的多少来调整“浮鲸”露出水面的高度。
    这种“浮鲸”除了供给架桥使用以外，还有许多别的用处。把它放在码头旁边的水面上，可以用来装卸货物。几个“浮鲸”可以拼成一座浮桥，通行车辆。如果在“浮鲸”的腹部安上水力发电设备，在背上安装操纵设备，它便成为一座水力发电站。
    八月间，第一批试制成功的几十具“浮鲸”，就要运到武汉长江大桥工地。
    “浮鲸”是苏联在1953年试制成功的产品。沈阳桥梁厂职工在苏联专家帮助之下，从去年冬天开始试制。现在，他们平均每三天就能造出一具“浮鲸”。
