    The Development of the Trend Towards Peace and Neutrality
    Shi Lü
    In recent years, a group of countries that have declared non-alignment as a principle of their foreign policy have emerged on the world stage. These countries are generally referred to as countries of peace and neutrality.
    Peace and neutrality is not passive non-interference, let alone "sitting on the mountain to watch the tigers fight," but an independent, active policy of fighting to safeguard national sovereignty and world peace. Peace and neutrality does not mean standing outside all forces, but only standing outside the forces of war; it is an important component of the world's peaceful forces. The positive role that India, Burma, Indonesia, Egypt, and other countries pursuing the same policy have played in international affairs in recent years, and their outstanding contributions to the cause of world peace, illustrate the positive significance of peace and neutrality.
    Peace and neutrality is a resistance to the American aggressive bloc's "policy of strength." As everyone knows, one of the characteristics of the "policy of strength" is to actively prepare to attack socialist countries under the guise of "opposing communism" by piecing together military blocs and concluding military agreements, and on the other hand, to use these blocs and agreements to ensure the dominance of the United States in the capitalist world. Countries pursuing a policy of peace and neutrality correctly recognize that joining an imperialist military bloc inevitably leads to the loss of their sovereignty and interests, inevitably leads to an arms race that is greatly detrimental to the national economy and the people's livelihood, and carries the risk of being dragged into a whirlpool of war that they do not need at all. Therefore, these countries resolutely refuse to join imperialist military blocs, and actively oppose the piecing together of military blocs, advocating peaceful coexistence among all countries in the world. The struggle of these countries to safeguard their right to pursue an independent foreign policy, and their efforts to strive for world peace, have won the support of their people, won the respect of the people of the world, raised their international status, and to an increasing extent, aroused the envy of those countries that have fallen into difficulties due to joining imperialist military blocs.
    Precisely because of this, in recent years, the trend towards peace and neutrality has been strengthening day by day in Asia and Western Europe. More and more countries have openly declared that they pursue a policy of neutrality, agree to peaceful coexistence, and do not participate in imperialist military blocs. In those countries that have been dragged into military blocs by the United States, there is a growing centrifugal tendency away from the United States. Although the ruling figures of these countries are still勉强 struggling to justify their policy of participating in military blocs, they also frequently express their dissatisfaction with the United States.
    Due to the direct influence of peaceful and neutral countries such as India, Burma, Indonesia, and Egypt, and also because the arms expansion and war preparation policy pursued by the American aggressive bloc in the Asian-African region contains obvious colonialist aims, the imperialist military bloc has met with the greatest resistance in this region, and the trend towards peace and neutrality has achieved the most significant development.
    Speaking of the widespread development of the trend towards peace and neutrality in the Asian-African region, the Asian-African Conference in April 1955 should be mentioned first. It was precisely at this conference of great historical significance that the call for peaceful coexistence and the development of friendly cooperation among all countries in the world was issued; and it was from the Asian-African Conference onwards that peace and neutrality gradually became the mainstream of the political climate in the Asian-African region.
    In the Ceylon parliamentary elections in April of this year, the People's United Front led by Bandaranaike, which advocated peace and neutrality, defeated the United National Party, which pursued a pro-American policy, with an absolute advantage. After the new Bandaranaike government was formed, it has taken a series of measures to ensure that Ceylon moves forward along the path of peace and neutrality. The political changes in Ceylon are an important development in the trend towards peace and neutrality in the Southeast Asian region.
    The political situation in Cambodia is another important development in the trend towards peace and neutrality in the Southeast Asian region. Under the leadership of Prince Sihanouk, Cambodia is fighting against the overbearing pressure of the United States in order to maintain its peaceful and neutral stance. The friendly relations between China and Cambodia, which were established through Prince Sihanouk's visit to China in February of this year, have been further consolidated through the recently signed Sino-Cambodian economic assistance agreement. Last month, Prince Sihanouk visited Poland, and recently paid friendly visits to the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia and other countries. Cambodia has repeatedly stated that it rejects the "protection" of the Manila Treaty. All the above shows that Cambodia's trend towards peace and neutrality is becoming increasingly clear.
    Even in some Asian countries that have joined the so-called "Southeast Asia Defense Group," such as Pakistan, the Philippines, and Thailand, the idea of peace and neutrality is gradually gaining ground. More and more political figures in these countries are beginning to doubt the benefits of joining military blocs.
    In the Middle East, most Arab countries have increasingly clearly expressed their will for peace and neutrality. Egypt and many other countries in the Middle East resolutely oppose the Baghdad Pact; Egypt has established diplomatic relations with China; Soviet Foreign Minister Shepilov visited Egypt, Syria, and Lebanon; the Crown Prince of Yemen visited the Soviet Union, the German Democratic Republic, and Czechoslovakia; and so on. All these indicate that the position of peace and neutrality in the Middle East is being consolidated day by day. The Baghdad Pact is not only unable to make any progress in the Middle East, but is also becoming increasingly lifeless.
    In Europe, the development of the trend towards peace and neutrality has also been increasingly significant in recent years. As everyone knows, among the European countries other than socialist countries, the vast majority have been dragged into the North Atlantic Group by the United States, and the United States has also been attempting to establish control over the small number of countries that have not been dragged in. However, the hope of realizing this attempt by the United States is becoming increasingly small. Austria has declared permanent neutralization; Switzerland and Sweden have repeatedly reiterated their intention to adhere to their traditional neutrality; the results of the Finnish presidential election in February of this year emphasized the election of Kekkonen, who advocates Soviet-Finnish friendship and pursues a policy of peace and neutrality, as president; and the government leaders of Finland and Sweden have visited the Soviet Union, strengthening their friendly relations with the Soviet Union.
    Within the member states of the North Atlantic Group, the United States has also failed to prevent the development of the trend towards peace and neutrality.
    Take Iceland as an example. The previous parliament of Iceland passed a resolution requesting the withdrawal of American troops from Iceland. In the recent parliamentary elections, the parties advocating the withdrawal of American troops from Iceland again won a majority of seats.
    The government leaders of Norway and Denmark have successively visited the Soviet Union. They all agreed that relations between countries should be based on the principles of non-interference in each other's internal affairs, respect for each other's sovereignty, non-aggression, and equal cooperation.
    In the Greek elections in February of this year, the Greek Democratic Alliance, which called for the establishment of friendly relations with all countries and the implementation of an independent foreign policy, won a majority of votes. The pro-American party only maintained its ruling position by relying on an unreasonable electoral system to obtain a slim majority of seats. Nevertheless, the Western press also admitted that neutral sentiments are growing among senior Greek government officials.
    In Italy, the call for the implementation of a neutral policy is becoming louder and louder. During his visit to the United States in March of this year, Italian President Gronchi openly declared that he was neither right nor left politically, advocating that "all hopes and aspirations should be aimed at achieving peaceful coexistence and understanding," and believed that peaceful coexistence between East and West was possible.
    It is especially worth noting that during the Anglo-Soviet talks in April and the Franco-Soviet talks in May, both Britain and France agreed to improve their relations with the Soviet Union and, in essence, recognized the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. This reflects that in Britain and France, the forces demanding the implementation of an independent policy and opposing blindly following a policy of cold war have developed more than in the past.
    The strengthening of the trend towards peace and neutrality is obviously causing great unease to the American ruling clique, because, for the United States, this means that America's aggressive policy is in a more seriously isolated situation.
    If in the previous few years, when the trend towards peace and neutrality had just appeared on the world stage, the American ruling clique sneered at it and rudely used political and economic pressure in an attempt to suppress this trend, then now, some more flexible minds within the American ruling clique, including President Eisenhower, have begun to feel that they must face reality. Hard suppression is no longer possible, and other methods (such as a "soft" policy) need to be adopted to ease the contradictions between the United States and neutral countries in order to alleviate their increasingly serious isolation. This explains why Indonesian President Sukarno received a grand reception in the United States, and why Eisenhower expressed respect for neutral countries that do not participate in military blocs in his June 6th speech.
    However, there are still some diehards in the American ruling clique. They fear that neutralism will disintegrate the military blocs they have painstakingly pieced together. They hate neutralism and still dream of killing neutralism with one blow. Dulles's speech on June 9th represents the thinking of this group of people. In that speech, Dulles once again advocated the necessity of piecing together military blocs, and rudely attacked the principle of neutralism as "an obsolete... immoral and shortsighted concept."
    Dulles's speech is obviously contradictory to Eisenhower's speech. This shows that the American ruling clique is still hesitant on how to eliminate the influence of peace and neutrality in order to promote its aggressive policy. We are not prepared to guess here whether the "soft" policy or the "big stick" policy will prevail in the future in the American ruling clique's attitude towards the issue of neutralism; we only want to point out that as long as the American ruling clique does not abandon its aggressive policy for one day, and does not respect neutral countries in true action for one day, then neither the "soft" policy nor the "big stick" policy can prevent the increasing development of the trend towards peace and neutrality in the Asian-African region and Western Europe, and cannot help the United States escape its increasingly serious isolation.

    和平中立趋向的发展
    施旅
    最近几年来，世界舞台上出现了一批宣布以不参加集团作为外交政策的原则的国家。人们通常把这些国家称为和平中立的国家。
    和平中立不是消极的袖手旁观，更不是“坐山观虎斗”，而是一种独立的、积极的、为维护国家主权和世界和平而斗争的政策。和平中立不是置身于一切力量之外，而只是置身于战争势力之外；它是世界和平力量的重要组成部分。印度、缅甸、印度尼西亚、埃及以及其他执行同样政策的国家，这几年来在国际事务上所起的良好作用和对世界和平事业的卓越贡献，就说明了和平中立的积极意义。
    和平中立是对美国侵略集团的“实力”政策的一种反抗。大家知道，“实力”政策的特点之一就是：通过在“反对共产主义”的幌子下拼凑军事集团和缔结军事协定的办法，一方面积极准备进攻社会主义阵营各国，另一方面也就利用这些集团和协定，来确保美国在资本主义世界的统治地位。执行和平中立政策的国家正确地认识到，参加了帝国主义军事集团，就不可避免地要丧失自己的主权和利益，就不可避免地会使自己陷入大大有害于国计民生的军备竞赛里面去，就有随时被卷入自己完全不需要的战争漩涡中去的危险。因此，这些国家坚决拒绝参加帝国主义军事集团，并且还积极反对拼凑军事集团，主张世界各国和平共处。这些国家为了维护自己执行独立的外交政策的权利而进行的斗争，以及它们为争取世界和平而提供的努力，获得了本国人民的拥护，赢得了世界人民的尊敬，提高了它们的国际地位，并且在日益加深的程度上，引起了那些由于参加了帝国主义军事集团而陷于困境的国家的羡慕。
    正是因为这样，近年来在亚洲和西欧，和平中立的趋向一天一天加强。越来越多的国家公开宣布奉行中立政策，赞成和平共处，不参加帝国主义军事集团。在那些被美国拖入军事集团的国家中，滋长着日益强烈的对美国的离心倾向，这些国家的当政人物虽然还在勉强为自己参加军事集团的政策辩解，但是也经常表露出对美国的不满情绪。
    由于印度、缅甸、印度尼西亚和埃及这些和平中立国家的直接影响，也由于美国侵略集团在亚非地区推行的扩军备战政策包含着明显的殖民主义目的，因此，在这一地区，帝国主义军事集团受到了最大的抵抗，和平中立的趋向获得了最显著的发展。
    说到和平中立趋向在亚非地区的广泛发展，首先应该提到1955年4月的亚非会议。正是在这个有着伟大历史意义的会议上，发出了要求世界各国和平相处并发展友好合作的呼声；也正是从亚非会议以后，和平中立逐渐形成为亚非地区政治气候的主流。
    在今年四月的锡兰议会选举中，主张和平中立的由班达拉奈克领导的人民联合阵线，以绝对优势击败了执行亲美政策的统一国民党。新的班达拉奈克政府组成后，已采取了一系列的措施，以保证锡兰沿着和平中立的道路前进。锡兰的政治变化，是和平中立趋向在东南亚地区的一个重要发展。
    柬埔寨的政治形势，是和平中立趋向在东南亚地区的另一个重要发展。柬埔寨在西哈努克亲王的领导下，正为维护自己的和平中立立场而同美国的横暴压力进行着斗争。由于今年二月西哈努克亲王来华访问而建立起来的中柬友好关系，通过最近签订的中柬经济援助协定而更加巩固了。上一个月西哈努克亲王访问了波兰，最近又对苏联、捷克斯洛伐克等国进行了友好访问。柬埔寨一再声明拒绝马尼拉条约的“保护”。以上一切都说明柬埔寨的和平中立趋向是日益鲜明了。
    即使是参加了所谓“东南亚防御集团”的一些亚洲国家，如巴基斯坦、菲律宾和泰国，和平中立的思想也在逐渐抬头。这些国家里越来越多的政界人物，开始怀疑参加军事集团有什么好处。
    在中近东，大多数阿拉伯国家越来越明确地表示了和平中立的意志。埃及和中近东的其他许多国家坚决反对巴格达条约；埃及同中国建立外交关系；苏联外交部长谢皮洛夫访问埃及、叙利亚和黎巴嫩等国；也门皇太子访问苏联、德意志民主共和国和捷克斯洛伐克；等等，这些都表明了和平中立的阵地在中近东地区是日益巩固了。巴格达条约在中近东地区不但寸步难进，而且越来越无生气。
    在欧洲，近年来和平中立趋向的发展也是日益显著的。大家都知道，除了社会主义国家之外的欧洲国家中，绝大多数都被美国拖进了北大西洋集团，而对少数未被拖进去的国家，美国也一直企图建立对它们的控制，然而，美国这一企图实现的希望是越来越微小了。奥地利已宣布永久中立化；瑞士和瑞典一再重申要坚持它们的传统的中立；今年二月芬兰总统选举的结果，强调苏芬友好和奉行和平中立政策的吉科宁当选为总统；芬兰和瑞典的政府领导人都访问了苏联，加强了和苏联的友好关系。
    在北大西洋集团各成员国中，美国也未能阻止和平中立趋向的发展。
    拿冰岛来说，冰岛上届议会曾经通过决议要求美国军队撤出冰岛，在最近举行的本届议会选举中，主张美军撤出冰岛的各党派又获得了大多数席位。
    挪威和丹麦的政府领导人相继访问了苏联，他们都同意了各国之间的关系应该建立在互不干涉内政、尊重各国主权、互不侵犯、平等合作这些原则的基础上。
    在今年二月的希腊选举中，要求同所有国家建立友好关系并执行独立外交政策的希腊民主联盟获得了多数选票，亲美政党只是依靠不合理的选举制度才得到了微弱多数的议席而保住了执政地位；尽管如此，西方报刊也承认中立情绪在希腊政府高级官员中日益滋长。
    在意大利，要求执行中立政策的呼声越来越响亮。意大利总统格隆基今年三月访问美国时，公开宣称自己在政治上既不偏右也不偏左，鼓吹“所有希望和抱负都应当以获致和平共处和谅解为目的”，并且认为东西方的和平共处是可能的。
    尤其值得注意的是，今年四月的英苏会谈和五月的法苏会谈中，英、法两国都同意要改善它们和苏联的关系，并且在实质上承认了和平共处的五项原则。这就反映了在英法两国内部，要求执行独立政策、反对一味追随冷战政策的力量，已比过去有了发展。
    和平中立趋向的加强，显然使美国统治集团大大不安，因为，对美国说来，这就意味着美国的侵略政策处于更严重的孤立境地。
    如果说在前几年当和平中立趋向在世界舞台上刚出现的时候，美国统治集团是嗤之以鼻、粗暴地运用政治的和经济的压力，企图把这种趋向硬压下去的话，那末，现在美国统治集团中包括艾森豪威尔总统在内的某些头脑比较灵活的人，开始感到必须正视现实，硬压已经不行，需要采取其他办法（譬如说“怀柔”政策）来缓和美国同中立国家之间的矛盾，以减轻自己越来越严重的孤立地位了。这说明了为什么印度尼西亚苏加诺总统在美国受到了隆重的接待，为什么艾森豪威尔在他六月六日的谈话中表示尊重不参加军事集团的中立国家。
    然而，美国统治集团中还有一部分顽固分子，他们害怕中立主义将要瓦解他们苦心拼凑的军事集团，他们仇视中立主义，仍梦想把中立主义一棍子打死。杜勒斯六月九日的演说就代表了这部分人的思想；在那篇演说中，杜勒斯又一次鼓吹拼凑军事集团的必要性，并且粗暴地攻击中立主义原则是“一个陈旧的……不道德的和近视的概念。”
    杜勒斯的演说同艾森豪威尔的谈话显然是矛盾的，这表明了美国统治集团内部在如何消除和平中立的影响以利于推行侵略政策这一点上，还是举棋不定。我们这里也不准备去猜测今后美国统治集团在对待中立主义的问题上究竟是“怀柔”政策得胜，还是“大棒”政策占上风；我们只愿意指出：只要美国统治集团一天不放弃它的侵略政策，一天不在真正的行动上尊重中立国家，那末，无论是“怀柔”政策，也无论是“大棒”政策，都不能阻止亚非地区和西欧地区和平中立趋向的日益发展，都不能帮助美国解脱日益严重的孤立地位。
