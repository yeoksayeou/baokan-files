    Wuhan Steps Up Flood Prevention Preparations
    Yangtze and Han River Flood Peaks Pass Hankou
    Wuhan dispatch: Recently, the water levels of the Yangtze River and Han River have risen rapidly. At 2:00 PM on the 6th of this month, the water level at the Wuhan Customs station had risen to 25.75 meters, approaching the warning level. On the 5th, the water level at the Duoluokou station of the Han River had risen to 27.4 meters, exceeding the warning level by 1.1 meters. The patrol teams organized by the Duoluokou construction site of the Hankou Engineering Office of the Wuhan Municipal Water Conservancy Bureau are patrolling the dikes day and night. Responsible comrades such as the site director and the party general branch secretary have implemented a round-the-clock duty system. Site cadres have organized a dike patrol and inspection team to solve any sudden problems at any time. Special personnel have been assigned to guard weak areas and dangerous areas subject to backflow and head-on impact. Many capital construction units have also taken the initiative to remove construction materials originally piled on the dikes to reduce the load on the dikes.
    The Wuhan Municipal Water Conservancy Bureau has inspected all the gates in the city. All gates within one meter of the water level have been closed, and sufficient yellow earth and sacks have been prepared near the gates. At present, the Water Conservancy Bureau has prepared more than 60,000 cubic meters of sand and stone, more than 100,000 grass bags, as well as lighting equipment, iron tools and other flood control materials.

    武汉市加紧防汛准备
    长江和汉水洪峰已过汉口
    本报武汉电　近来长江、汉水水位都迅速上涨，本月六日下午二时，武汉关水位已涨到25.75公尺，接近警戒水位。五日汉江舵落口水位已涨到27.4公尺，超过警戒水位1.1公尺。武汉市水利局汉口工程处舵落口工地组织的巡堤队伍，正在日夜巡堤。工地主任、党总支书记等负责同志实行了通宵值班制度，工地干部组织了巡堤检查小组，以便随时解决突然发生的问题，对回流顶冲的薄弱地区和险区，已派专人看守。很多基本建设单位为了减轻堤防的乘载，也主动把原堆放在堤上的建筑器材搬走。
    武汉市水利局已将全市闸门作了检查，距离水位一公尺的闸门都已封闭，在闸门附近，还预备了足够的黄土、麻袋。目前水利局已准备沙、石六万多方，草袋十万多条，以及照明设备、铁具等防汛器材。
