In the coming two years, while simultaneously expanding the construction scale of both heavy and light industries, the state plans to increase investment in light industry. The investment ratio between heavy and light industries will change from the original Five-Year Plan's eight-to-one to seven-to-one. The number of light industrial construction units above the limit planned for construction within the first Five-Year Plan will increase from the original 65 to 99. Vice Premier Li Fuchun explained this issue in his speech at the Third Session of the First National People's Congress. Clearly, these increases in light industrial construction units and changes in investment ratios are necessary, and they fully align with the interests of socialist industrialization.

Some ask, since socialist industrialization requires prioritizing the development of heavy industry, and light industry's output currently still accounts for more than half of the total industrial output in our country, why not further increase the investment ratio in heavy industry to rapidly establish its dominance? Why change the investment ratio between heavy and light industries from eight-to-one to seven-to-one instead? Why is it said to be necessary and in line with the interests of socialist industrialization?

This must be discussed from the perspectives of meeting the people's growing material and cultural needs and increasing national construction accumulation. We know that gradually improving the people's living standards on the basis of developing production is the Party and the People's Government's policy. To improve the people's living standards, it is not enough to merely increase the people's wage income or other labor income; it is also necessary to correspondingly increase the production and supply of consumer goods so that people can buy more and better things. Light industry can meet people's needs for food, clothing, and daily necessities. Currently, calculated on a per capita basis, our country's light industrial output still lags behind many countries. Taking the textile industry as an example, China's cotton textile industry needs to increase more than threefold to catch up with the current Soviet Union, and more than double to catch up with the current India. The wool, flax, and silk weaving industry needs to increase nearly fortyfold to catch up with the current Soviet Union, and nearly twofold to catch up with India four years ago. From this, it can be seen that although light industry already occupies a dominant position in the total industrial output value, it is far from meeting the actual needs.

90% of our light industry's raw materials come from rural areas, and about 60% of its products are sold in rural areas. This means that the development speed of light industry, to a large extent, depends on the development of agriculture. If agriculture increases production, rural areas will supply more raw materials to light industry, and rural areas will need more consumer goods, so light industry production must increase accordingly. If agriculture decreases production, rural areas will supply fewer raw materials to light industry, and rural areas will need fewer consumer goods, so light industry production must also decrease accordingly. The trend of agricultural cooperativization and rapid development of agricultural production in our country, and the trend of rapid growth in the purchasing power of urban and rural people, all require us to actively develop light industry on the basis of vigorously developing agriculture, while prioritizing the development of heavy industry. Otherwise, the raw materials that farmers produce will be much more than now, and there will be nowhere to sell them, and the consumer goods needed by 600 million people, which are much more in quantity and higher in quality than now, will not be satisfied.

From the perspective of increasing national accumulation, actively developing light industry is of even greater significance. Light industrial products are necessities for people's lives and the main source of supply for the market. The profits, depreciation, and taxes generated by it each year become one of the main sources of national fiscal revenue. Compared to heavy industry, light industrial enterprises require less basic construction investment, have shorter construction periods, and recover investment quickly. Generally, light industrial enterprises can recover all investment in about one year after going into production, and some light industrial enterprises can even recover all investment in a few months after going into production. In the industrial construction of the first Five-Year Plan, the investment ratio between heavy and light industries has changed from eight-to-one to seven-to-one, that is, about 369 million yuan more will be taken out of industrial investment to increase light industrial construction. If 369 million yuan represents the investment of a not-so-large modern heavy industrial enterprise, then it is at the cost of temporarily building one less heavy industrial enterprise, and in a few years, it will be exchanged for investment that can build several of the same enterprises.

Based on the above reasons, under the guidance of the national general plan, actively developing light industry in proportion not only does not violate the policy of prioritizing the development of heavy industry, but also helps to realize the policy of prioritizing the development of heavy industry; it will not only not postpone the increase in the proportion of heavy industry output value in the total industrial output value, but also accelerate the increase in the proportion of heavy industry. Therefore, the view that actively developing light industry is opposed to prioritizing the development of heavy industry is one-sided and wrong; the view that only heavy industry is important and light industry is not important is also incorrect. Under the circumstance that the construction scale of light and heavy industries is expanded simultaneously, appropriately increasing the investment ratio of light industry is not to cancel the policy of prioritizing the development of heavy industry, but only to adjust the ratio of heavy industry, light industry and agriculture to be more suitable for the current actual situation in our country, and to adjust it to be more conducive to the overall development of the entire national economy, and to adjust it to be more conducive to gradually improving the living standards of our people, under the premise of prioritizing the development of heavy industry.

Now, the investment ratio in light industry has increased, and the basic construction tasks of the light industry sector have been greatly increased. If these newly built light industrial enterprises, especially the newly built enterprises in the textile, sugar making, and paper making industries, cannot be completed on schedule and put into production, they will not be able to meet the growing urgent needs of the people's lives. Therefore, all employees who are responsible for the construction tasks of light industrial enterprises should strive to complete this year's plan, strive to complete the first Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule, and prepare to welcome the basic construction tasks of light industry in the second Five-Year Plan, which has a construction scale much larger than the first Five-Year Plan, so as to increase the production of light industrial products, let our people live better, and let our country get more funds to build heavy industry.

In addition to stepping up the construction of new light industrial enterprises, it is also necessary to tap the potential of existing light industrial enterprises. So far, the potential of many industries in China's light industry has not been fully exploited. In terms of fully exploiting the potential of existing light industry, the main thing is to do two things well. One is to do a good job in the socialist transformation of joint state-private enterprises, private enterprises, and handicrafts, because the output value of these economic types of enterprises accounts for more than half of the total output value of light industry, and these enterprises have greater potential than state-owned enterprises of the same scale. Another task is to gradually carry out necessary technical transformations of existing enterprises, the main one being the transformation of machinery and equipment. Some enterprises can greatly increase output and quality and increase varieties as long as they balance or add some equipment, and some enterprises can greatly increase output and quality and increase varieties as long as they transform or replace some main equipment.

The output value of existing light industry in coastal areas accounts for about 70% of the total light industry, and the equipment and technical conditions are generally better than those in the inland. For these enterprises, except for those that are too far from the raw material producing areas and markets, and have large transportation volumes, those that require less investment, have high and fast returns, and are needed by society can reasonably and fully exploit their potential. Enterprises that have the conditions for expansion or renovation can also produce products equivalent to those produced by a new factory with only one-third or one-half of the investment and construction period of a new factory. In this way, we can use less investment, less manpower and material resources, and in a shorter period of time, to achieve the goals of increasing output, improving quality, increasing varieties, meeting social needs, and increasing national accumulation.

### 为什么要增加轻工业的投资比重

    为什么要增加轻工业的投资比重
    在今明两年内，国家准备在轻重工业的建设规模同时扩大的情况下，更多地增加一些轻工业方面的投资。重工业和轻工业的投资比例，将由原五年计划规定的八比一变为七比一；第一个五年内计划施工的限额以上的轻工业建设单位，将由原来的六十五个增加到九十九个。李富春副总理在第一届全国人民代表大会第三次会议上的发言里说明了这个问题。显然这些轻工业建设单位的增加和投资比例的改变是必要的，这完全符合于社会主义工业化的利益。
    有人问，既然社会主义工业化要求优先发展重工业，而我国目前轻工业产值仍占全部工业总产值的一半以上；在这种情况下，为什么不更多地增加重工业的投资比重，使它迅速占优势，反而要把重工业和轻工业的投资比例由八比一改变为七比一呢？为什么说它是必要的和符合于社会主义工业化的利益的呢？
    这要从满足人民日益增长着的物质生活和文化生活的需要，从增加国家建设积累两个方面来谈。我们知道，在发展生产的基础上，逐步改善人民生活，是党和人民政府的方针。而要改善人民生活，仅仅增加人民的工资收入或其它劳动收入是不够的，还需要相应地增加生活资料的生产和供应，使人民能够买到更多更好的东西。轻工业就能够满足人们吃的、穿的和用的需要。现在，按人口平均计算，我国的轻工业产量也还是落在许多国家之后。以纺织工业为例：我国的棉纺织工业要增加三倍以上，才能赶上现在的苏联，要增加一倍以上，才能赶上现在的印度；毛麻丝织工业需要增加近四十倍，才能赶上现在的苏联，需要增加近两倍，才能赶上四年前的印度。由此可见，我国轻工业在工业总产值中虽然已占优势，但是它还远远不够满足实际的需要。
    我国轻工业的原料，有90％来自农村，产品约有60％销售于农村。这就是说，轻工业的发展速度，在相当大的程度上要决定于农业的发展。农业增产了，农村供给轻工业的原料多一些，农村需要的消费品多一些，轻工业的生产就要相应地增加。农业减产了，农村供给轻工业的原料少一些，农村需要的消费品少一些，轻工业的生产也就要相应地减少。我国农业合作化和农业生产迅速发展的趋势，城乡人民购买力迅速增长的趋势，都要求我们在优先发展重工业的同时，在大力发展农业的基础上，积极地发展轻工业。否则，农民们生产出来的比现在多得多的原料，就会没处推销，六亿人民所需要的数量比现在多得多、质量还要高的消费品，就会得不到满足。
    从增加国家积累来看，积极地发展轻工业更有重大的意义。轻工业产品是人民生活必需品，是供应市场的主要货源，它每年所产生的利润、折旧和税收，就成为国家财政收入的主要来源之一。比起重工业来，轻工业企业的基本建设投资少，建设期间短，投资收回也很快。一般轻工业企业在投入生产以后，只要一年左右就可以收回全部投资，有的轻工业企业甚至在投入生产以后几个月就可以收回全部投资。在第一个五年计划的工业建设中，重工业和轻工业的投资比例由八比一变为七比一，也就是从工业的投资中，多拿出约3.69亿元来增加轻工业的建设。如果以3.69亿元代表一个不算大的现代化的重工业企业的投资的话，那末，就是以暂时少建设一个重工业企业的代价，数年内换来可建几个同样企业的投资。
    根据上述理由，在国家总计划的指导之下，按比例地积极地发展轻工业，不但不违背优先发展重工业的方针，而且更有助于实现优先发展重工业的方针；不但不会推迟重工业产值在工业总产值中比重的上升，而且更能加速重工业比重的上升。所以，把积极地发展轻工业同优先发展重工业相对立起来的观点是片面的、错误的；那种认为只有重工业才是重要的、轻工业是不重要的观点，也是不对的。在轻重工业建设规模同时扩大的情况下，适当地增加轻工业的投资比重，并不是取消优先发展重工业的方针，而仅仅是在优先发展重工业的前提下，把重工业、轻工业和农业的比例调整得更适合于我国当前的实际情况，调整得更有利于整个国民经济的全面发展，调整得更有利于逐步提高我国人民生活水平。
    现在，轻工业的投资比重增加了，轻工业部门的基本建设任务大大加重了。这些新建的轻工业企业，特别是纺织业、制糖业和造纸业的新建企业，如果不能如期建成，投入生产，就不能满足人民生活日益增长的迫切需要。所以，担负轻工业企业的建设任务的全体职工，应该努力完成今年的计划，争取提前完成第一个五年计划，并准备迎接建设规模比第一个五年还大得多的第二个五年计划的轻工业的基本建设任务，以便增加轻工业产品的生产，让我国人民生活得更好，让我们的国家得到更多的资金去建设重工业。
    除了加紧建设新的轻工业企业以外，还需要发挥现有轻工业企业的潜力。到目前为止，我国轻工业中许多行业的潜力还没有充分发挥。在充分发挥现有轻工业潜力方面，主要是做好两件工作。一是做好公私合营企业、私营企业和手工业的社会主义改造，因为这些经济类型企业的产值占轻工业总产值的一半以上，这些企业比同样规模的国营企业具有更大的潜力。另一个工作就是逐步地对现有企业进行必要的技术改造，其中主要的是改造机器设备。有的企业，只要平衡或增添一些设备，有的企业，只要改造或更换一些主要设备，就可以大大提高产量和质量，增加品种。
    沿海现有轻工业的产值占全部轻工业的70％左右，而且设备和技术条件一般都比内地的好。对于这些企业，除了距离原料产地和市场太远、运输量又大的以外，凡是投资少、收效大而快、社会又需要的，都可以合理地充分地发挥它的潜力。有条件扩建或改建的企业，也只要新建厂三分之一或二分之一的投资和建设年限，就能生产出相当于一个新建厂所生产的产品来。这样，我们就可以用比较少的投资，比较少的人力和物力，在比较短的时间内，达到增加产量，提高质量，增加品种，满足社会需要，增加国家积累的目的。
