Xinhua News Agency, London, July 10th: The British Foreign Office announced that British Prime Minister Eden had written a reply to Soviet Chairman of the Council of Ministers Bulganin’s letter of June 6th concerning the call for disarmament by major powers. Eden’s reply was delivered to Bulganin on the 9th by British Ambassador to the Soviet Union Hayter.

Bulganin’s letter of June 6th mentioned the Soviet Union's new decision to reduce its military by 1.2 million troops, and suggested that major powers immediately take disarmament measures without waiting for the achievement of an international agreement.

In his reply, Eden welcomed the Soviet disarmament. According to him, Britain has significantly reduced its armed forces over the past three years and since the Second World War. Eden continued, "I personally feel that such unilateral reductions are helpful. However, I do not consider them sufficient in themselves if international trust and security are to develop as we hope. To promote this trust, disarmament must be based on an international agreement providing for effective supervision and observation, as well as measures to guard against surprise attacks."

Eden said that the British government "will continue to make every effort to secure, through the United Nations, an agreement on the limitation, reduction, and supervision of armaments, including nuclear weapons. The United Nations Disarmament Commission and its Subcommittee must work tirelessly to reach an agreement that will establish an appropriate international system of supervision to ensure everyone's safety."

In his letter, Bulganin also suggested that the United States, Britain, and France follow the Soviet example of reducing their troops stationed in Germany, in order to facilitate the resolution of the German problem.

In his reply, Eden said when addressing this proposal: "It seems to me that it is not practical to consider your suggestion in isolation. I earnestly hope to find ways to reduce armed forces and armaments. However, in order to establish genuine understanding in Europe, it is also necessary for the people of Western Europe to feel that the existing safeguards that guarantee their security will be retained."

He also said: "On the other hand, making broad arrangements that consider not only disarmament issues but also pressing political issues, especially the issue of restoring German unification, will make genuine progress possible. In this regard, I am always ready to do my best to provide any assistance."

Reuters said that this reply from Eden had been discussed with NATO allies during its drafting.

    艾登复信布尔加宁欢迎苏联裁军
    但又说裁军问题要和政治问题同时考虑
    新华社10日讯　伦敦消息：英国外交部宣布，英国首相艾登写信答复苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁六月六日一封关于呼吁大国裁军的信。艾登的复信已经在九日由英国驻苏联大使海特尔交给布尔加宁。
    布尔加宁六月六日的信里提到苏联裁军一百二十万人的新决定，并且建议大国立即采取裁军措施，而不必等到达成国际协议以后。
    艾登在回信里对苏联裁军表示欢迎。照他说，英国在过去三年来和第二次大战以后已经大大裁减了武装部队。艾登接着说：“我个人感到，这样的单方面裁减是有帮助的。但是，我并不认为它们本身是充分的，假如必须像我们希望的那样发展国际信任和安全的话。为了促进这种信任，裁军必须根据一项国际协定来进行，这种国际协定规定有效的监督和观察，也规定防卫突然袭击的措施。”
    艾登说：英国政府“将要继续进行一切努力来争取通过联合国达成一种关于限制裁减和监督包括核子武器在内的军备的协定。联合国裁军委员会和它的小组委员会必须坚持不懈地进行工作，以便达成一种协定，这种协定将要建立起适当的国际监督制度，以保证大家的安全。”
    布尔加宁在信里还建议美、英、法三国仿效苏联的榜样减少在德国境内的驻军，以便有利于德国问题的解决。
    艾登在回信里谈到这个建议时说：“在我看来，孤立地考虑你的这种建议似乎是行不通的。我迫切希望找到裁减武装部队和军备的方法。但是，为了在欧洲建立真正的谅解，也必须使西欧各国人民感觉到，保证他们安全的现有的保障，将要保留下来。”
    他并且说：“另一方面，进行广泛的安排，不仅考虑裁军问题，也考虑到迫切的政治问题，特别是恢复德国统一的问题，将会使真正的进展成为可能。在这方面，我随时准备尽力予以任何帮助。”
    路透社说，这封艾登的复信，在草拟的时候曾经同北大西洋集团的盟国商量过。
