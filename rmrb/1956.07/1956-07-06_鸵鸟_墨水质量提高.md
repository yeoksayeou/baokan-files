Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 4th - The "Ostrich" ink produced by the Tianjin Ink Factory has been rated as first-class ink by the China Stationery Company.

The quality of "Ostrich" ink was not very good for a period of time. However, after the efforts of the staff in the past six months, it has been improved. According to multiple tests by the factory's laboratory personnel, the current "Ostrich" ink has a lower corrosive effect on steel pen nibs than American "Parker" ink. When this ink is used to write on drawing paper, the writing will not disappear even after being soaked in water for twenty-four hours. Because this ink undergoes a ten-day stilling and settling process in the factory before leaving, ordinary bottled "Ostrich" ink will not produce sediment even after being left uncapped for twenty days.

In order to improve the quality of "Ostrich" ink, the staff of the Tianjin Ink Factory conducted qualitative and quantitative analyses of domestically produced "Minsheng" ink and imported "Parker," "Waterman," and other high-quality inks in January of this year. Based on the advantages of these products, they continuously improved the formula ratio and manufacturing methods of "Ostrich" ink.

### “鸵鸟”墨水质量提高

    “鸵鸟”墨水质量提高
    新华社天津4日电　天津市墨水厂出品的“鸵鸟”墨水，被中国文化用品公司评为第一流墨水。
    “鸵鸟”墨水有一个时期质量不十分好，近半年来经过职工们的努力，已有改进。据这个厂的化验人员多次试验证明，现在的“鸵鸟”墨水对钢笔尖的腐蚀性能比美国“派克”墨水还要低。用这种墨水在道林纸上写的字，被水浸泡二十四小时以后，字迹也不会消失。因为这种墨水在制成以后，要在工厂经过十天的静置沉淀才出厂，所以普通瓶装的“鸵鸟”墨水开盖放置二十天也不会产生沉淀现象。
    天津市墨水厂的职工为了改进“鸵鸟”墨水的质量，今年一月份曾经把国内的“民生”和进口的“派克”、“瓦特曼”等质量较好的墨水作了定性定量分析，根据这些产品的优点，不断地改进了“鸵鸟”墨水的配方比例和制造方法。
