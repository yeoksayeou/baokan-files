Xinhua News Agency, July 18th: According to TASS, the government delegations of the Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic held talks in Moscow on July 16th and 17th and issued a statement on the results of the talks on the 17th.

The statement said that during the talks, the two sides discussed issues related to further expanding the friendly relations and fraternal cooperation between the two countries, and reached a consensus on all issues discussed. Both sides unanimously pointed out that the comprehensive friendly relations between the two countries are developing smoothly, fully based on the principles of equal rights, mutual respect for sovereignty, and non-interference in internal affairs, and on the basis of the treaty between the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the German Democratic Republic signed on September 20, 1955.

In the spirit of promoting the further development of the economy of the German Democratic Republic and improving the people's living standards, the two governments agreed to reduce the expenses allocated by the German Democratic Republic for maintaining the Soviet troops stationed in Germany from 1.6 billion marks to 800 million marks per year, starting from January 1, 1957, in accordance with the above-mentioned treaty. The measure to reduce the expenses borne by the German Democratic Republic in this regard by 50% is linked to the large-scale reduction of the Soviet armed forces (including the reduction of Soviet troops stationed in Germany), and the resulting reduction in the overall cost of military needs.

Both sides determined that in 1956, the quantity of mutual supplies should greatly exceed the quantity stipulated in the current trade agreement. The Soviet Union will supply the German Democratic Republic with convertible currency so that it can purchase the goods it needs on the world market. In addition, the Soviet Union will grant it long-term credit on favorable terms.

The two sides also reached an agreement on measures to ensure the fullest and most rational utilization of the industrial potential of the German Democratic Republic and to expand the mutual supply of the latest machinery and equipment and other commodities and materials.

The statement said, "After the implementation of all the economic measures agreed upon during the talks, the German Democratic Republic will obtain a large amount of supplementary resources from 1957 to 1960 to develop its national economy."

The two government delegations stated that the achievements made by the German Democratic Republic in developing its national economy, as well as the fraternal assistance given by the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries, have enabled its working people to take a major step forward in building socialism, promoting economic development, and improving people's welfare.

The two countries expressed their intention to take further measures to develop scientific and cultural contacts and cooperation between each other.

The two governments reached an agreement on the establishment of a 100,000-kilowatt atomic energy power station in the German Democratic Republic. According to this agreement, the Soviet Union will help design the atomic energy power station and will supply the necessary equipment and materials.

The statement continued that a thorough exchange of views was conducted on international issues of mutual concern during the talks. The views of both sides on major international issues were completely consistent.

Both sides unanimously believed that the recent easing of international tensions has created a favorable atmosphere for countries, especially major powers, to reach agreements on disarmament and to ensure pan-European security through effective measures. The two governments believe that the attempts by certain countries to make the issue of disarmament dependent on any preconditions can only hinder the resolution of the issue of disarmament and other political issues.

The recent initiative taken by the government of the German Democratic Republic in reducing the number of the National People's Army, the proposal to reduce the armed forces of East and West Germany and to prohibit the storage of atomic weapons in Germany, and other measures taken to ease tensions in Germany, have created a real possibility for the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany to reach an understanding on issues of vital importance to the German people.

The statement also pointed out that "the conscription implemented by West Germany against the will of the German people has greatly complicated the solution of the national problem of the German people and hindered the easing of political tensions in Germany and other parts of Europe."

Considering that the Soviet Union has recently reduced the number of Soviet troops stationed in Germany by more than 50,000, the two governments requested the governments of the United States, Britain, and France to reduce the number of their troops stationed in the Federal Republic of Germany in order to withdraw all foreign troops from Germany in the future.

The statement said that the two governments believe that eleven years after the end of the war, and at a time when there are two generally recognized independent German states, it cannot be considered normal to maintain foreign troops in Germany.

Regarding the issue of German unification, the government of the German Democratic Republic announced that, proceeding from the interests of all the German people, it will strive in all its activities to restore German unification, making it a free, peace-loving, and democratic country. The Soviet government stated that it consistently adheres to the Leninist principle of the right of all nations to self-determination in its policies, and believes that the restoration of the unity of the German state is a matter for the German people themselves. "Both sides unanimously believe that under the current circumstances, there is no other way to restore German unification except through direct negotiations and agreements between the governments of the two German states (the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany)."

The two governments finally stated in the statement that they believe that the joint decisions made during this meeting will promote the further strengthening of friendship and fraternal cooperation between the two countries and will be a major contribution to consolidating peace and security in Europe.

The statement was signed by: Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, Bulganin, and Prime Minister of the German Democratic Republic, Grotewohl.

    对巩固欧洲和平和安全的重大贡献
    苏联和民主德国决定进一步扩大合作
    双方同意削减苏军驻德费用一半　主张两个德国直接协商统一
    新华社18日讯　据塔斯社报道：苏联政府代表团和德意志民主共和国政府代表团七月十六日和十七日在莫斯科举行了会谈，并且在十七日就会谈结果发表了声明。
    声明说，在这次会谈中双方讨论了有关进一步扩大两国之间的友好关系和兄弟合作的问题，并且就所讨论的一切问题取得了一致意见。双方一致指出，完全根据平等权利、互相尊重主权、互不干涉内政的原则，并且在1955年9月20日签订的关于苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟和德意志民主共和国之间的关系的条约的基础上，两国之间的全面的友好关系正在顺利地发展。
    本着促进德意志民主共和国经济的进一步发展和人民生活水平的提高的愿望，两国政府一致同意从1957年1月1日起把德意志民主共和国根据上述条约拨作维持苏联驻德国部队的经费，从每年十六亿马克削减到八亿马克。把德意志民主共和国在这方面承担的费用减少50％的这一措施，是同苏联武装部队的大量裁减（包括苏联驻德国部队的裁减），以及由此而引起的军事需要的全面费用的减少联系着的。
    双方认定，在1956年使互相供应的数量大大超过现行贸易协定所规定的数量，苏联将供给德意志民主共和国以可以兑换的货币，使它能够在世界市场上购买它所需要的货物。此外，苏联还将按有利的条件给它以长期的信贷。
    双方还就保证最充分地和最合理地利用德意志民主共和国的工业潜力和扩大最新机器和设备以及其他商品和物资的互相供应的一些措施达成了协议。
    声明说，“在实行所有在会谈期间一致同意的经济措施以后，德意志民主共和国将在1957年到1960年获得大量补充资源来发展它的国民经济。”
    两国政府代表团声明，德意志民主共和国在发展国民经济方面所取得的成就以及苏联和人民民主国家给予它的兄弟的支援，使得它的劳动人民在建设社会主义、促进经济发展和增进人民福利方面又迈进了一大步。
    两国表示要采取进一步的措施来发展彼此之间的科学、文化的接触和合作。
    两国政府就在德意志民主共和国建立一座十万瓩的原子能电力站问题达成了协议。根据这个协议，苏联将帮助设计原子能电力站，并且将供应必要的设备和材料。
    声明接着说，在会谈中就双方关心的国际问题彻底地交换了意见。双方在重大国际问题上的意见是完全一致的。
    双方一致认为，最近国际紧张局势的缓和为国家之间，尤其是大国之间，就裁军和通过有效措施来保障全欧安全达成协议创造了有利气氛。两国政府认为，某些国家使裁军问题决定于任何先决条件的企图，只能阻碍裁军问题的解决和其他政治问题的解决。
    德意志民主共和国政府最近在裁减国家人民军人数方面所采取的主动，关于裁减东西德武装部队和禁止在德国储存原子武器的建议，以及为了缓和德国紧张局势而采取的其他措施，为德意志民主共和国和德意志联邦共和国之间在对德国人民至关重要的问题上取得谅解创造了真正的可能性。
    声明同时指出，“西德违反德国人民的意志而实行的征兵，使德国人民的民族问题的解决大大地复杂起来，阻碍了德国和欧洲其他地区政治紧张局势的缓和。”
    考虑到苏联最近已经把苏联驻德国的军队裁减了五万多人，两国政府要求美国、英国和法国政府裁减它们驻在德意志联邦共和国的军队人数，以便以后从德国撤退一切外国军队。
    声明说，两国政府相信，战争结束已经十一年，今天存在着两个得到普遍承认的自主的德国，在这个时候，不能认为在德国保持外国部队是正常的。
    关于德国的统一问题，德意志民主共和国政府宣布，它从全体德国人民的利益的出发，将在它的一切活动中努力争取恢复德国统一，使它成为一个自由的、爱好和平的、民主的国家。苏联政府声明，它在它的政策中一贯遵循各国自决权利的列宁主义原则，认为恢复德意志国家的统一是德国人民自己的事情。“双方一致认为，在目前的情况下，除了通过两个德意志国家（德意志民主共和国和德意志联邦共和国）的政府之间的直接谈判和协议以外，没有恢复德国统一的其他办法。”
    两国政府最后在声明中表示相信，它们在这次会谈中作出的共同决定将会促进两国之间的友谊和兄弟合作的进一步加强，并且将是对巩固欧洲的和平和安全的重大贡献。
    在这个声明上签字的是：苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁和德意志民主共和国总理格罗提渥。
