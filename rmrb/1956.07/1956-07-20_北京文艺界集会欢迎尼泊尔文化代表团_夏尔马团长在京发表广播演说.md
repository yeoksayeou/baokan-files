Xinhua News Agency, July 19th—This evening, more than 4,000 people from Beijing's literary and art circles gathered at the Zhongshan Park Music Hall to welcome the visiting Nepalese Cultural Delegation.

    The cool summer breeze gently blew through the tree-lined theater. On the stage, decorated with the national flags of China and Nepal, were rows of vibrant potted flowers. The gathering began under the chairmanship of Cao Yu, vice chairman of the Beijing Federation of Literary and Art Workers. Professor Wu Han, Deputy Mayor of Beijing, delivered a welcoming speech, saying, "Today we are very happy to be able to gather with our Nepalese friends who have come to visit our country. The deep goodwill of the Nepalese people adds glory to this midsummer night."

    The head of the Nepalese Cultural Delegation to China, Ba. Sharma, spoke amidst warm applause. After recalling the long-standing friendship between the Chinese and Nepalese peoples, he happily said, "Friends, when our two peoples see representatives of both countries sitting together, respecting each other and respecting each other, who would not be happy!"

    The guests and hosts watched performances by actors from both countries at the meeting. Seated with Ba. Sharma were Vice Premier of the State Council He Long, Minister of Culture, Minister of Higher Education, Minister of Education, and others.

    Xinhua News Agency, July 19th—Ba. Sharma, head of the Nepalese Cultural Delegation to China, accepted an invitation from the Central People's Broadcasting Station here today to deliver a radio address to the Chinese people. He said that anyone who has a little interest in ancient history and culture can fully understand the essence and depth of the friendly relations that have existed between China and Nepal for hundreds of years. The people of China and Nepal have always respected each other, treated each other with honor and friendly feelings, and have always felt obligated to help each other and provide cooperation in all aspects.

    The Nepalese friend said, "I want to ask the Chinese people to believe that whenever the help and cooperation of the Nepalese people is needed, the Nepalese people are always ready to do their best."

    Ba. Sharma said that the world is a vast place that allows for the existence of many ideas and ideals. In their historical processes, China and Nepal have produced several cultures, the contents of which are roughly: loving the motherland and not hesitating to shed the last drop of blood to defend the independence of the motherland; sympathizing with and willing to help countries that are behind us in national development; sympathizing with the oppressed, and the most sincere desire to improve their own destiny through self-reliance and mutual assistance.

    Ba. Sharma said: "This virtue of caring for other countries is not unique to China and Nepal. It is a common characteristic of the various ancient civilizations of Asia and Africa. Last year's Bandung Conference was fundamentally inspired by the inherent cultural traditions of countless past generations. The success of the Bandung Conference made Asian and African countries feel their own strength. This feeling will inevitably deeply influence our mutual development and cooperation. This feeling will always exist, it is an eternal source of inspiration, and it calls on us to strive for greater achievements."

    北京文艺界集会欢迎尼泊尔文化代表团
    夏尔马团长在京发表广播演说
    据新华社19日讯　今天傍晚，北京文艺界人士四千多人在中山公园音乐堂集会欢迎尼泊尔访华文化代表团。
    夏夜的凉风徐徐吹过这个绿树环绕的剧场。在挂有中尼两国国旗的主席台上排着一列鲜艳的盆花。大会在北京市文学艺术工作者联合会副主席曹禺主持下开始。北京市副市长吴晗教授致欢迎词说：“今天我们非常高兴，能够和前来我国访问的尼泊尔朋友们欢聚一堂，你们带来的尼泊尔人民的盛意，给这仲夏的夜晚增添了光荣。”
    尼泊尔访华文化代表团团长巴·夏尔马在热烈掌声中讲话。他在回忆了中尼两国人民长远的友谊后，高兴地说：“朋友们，当我们两国人民看到两国代表坐在一起，彼此互相尊敬、互相尊重的这种动人景象，谁不感到高兴呢！”
    宾主在会上观看了两国演员的演出。和巴·夏尔马坐在一起的有国务院副总理贺龙和文化部长、高等教育部长、教育部长等。
    新华社19日讯　尼泊尔访华文化代表团团长巴·夏尔马今天在这里应中央人民广播电台的邀请向中国人民发表广播讲话。他说，任何人只要对古代历史和文化有一点兴趣，就能够充分了解中尼两国过去好几百年间存在的友好关系的本质和它的深厚程度。中国和尼泊尔的人民一直是互相尊敬的，彼此以荣誉和友好的感情相对待，并且永远认为有义务互相帮助和在各方面提供合作。
    这位尼泊尔友人说：“我要请中国人民相信，不论什么时候，如果需要尼泊尔人民的帮助和合作，尼泊尔人民是随时准备竭尽他们的能力的。”
    巴·夏尔马说，世界是一个广大的地方，它允许许多意念和理想存在。中尼两国在它们的历史进程中就产生过好几种文化，这些文化的内容大体上是：爱祖国、为保卫祖国的独立不惜流尽最后一滴血；同情而且愿意帮助在民族发展上比我们落后的国家；同情被压迫者，以及用自立和互助来改善自己命运的最衷心的愿望。
    巴·夏尔马说：“对其他国家的关切这种美德并不仅是中尼两国才有的。它是亚洲、非洲各种悠久文明的共同特征。去年的万隆会议在根本上就是受到过去无数世代的固有的文化传统的启发才召开的。万隆会议的成功，使得亚非国家感到了自己的力量。这种感觉必然深深地影响我们彼此的发展和合作。这种感觉将永远存在，它是亘古长流的灵感的泉源，它召唤着我们为了更高的成就而努力。”
