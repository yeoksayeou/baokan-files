    Shaanxi Conducts Comprehensive Survey of Crop Diseases, Pests, and Weeds
    (Our report) Shaanxi Province began a comprehensive survey of crop diseases, pests, and weeds in late July. This work is under the leadership of the Provincial Department of Agriculture, with the participation of more than 600 people, including students from agricultural colleges and agricultural technology extension cadres. Through this survey, the province will clarify the types, distribution, and damage of diseases, pests, and weeds, as well as their routes of transmission, laying the foundation for further plant quarantine and strengthening plant protection work.
    In order to promptly resolve technical issues arising during the survey, the Provincial Department of Agriculture has also established a Disease, Pest, and Weed Identification Committee, compiled survey manuals, and organized short-term training for survey personnel. (Yang Fan)

    本报讯　陕西省在七月下旬开始农作物病、虫、杂草的全面调查工作。这个工作是省农业厅领导的，参加这一工作的人有农业院校的学生、农业技术推广干部六百多人。通过这次调查，将摸清本省病、虫、杂草的种类、分布、为害等情况和它们的传播途径等，为进一步开展植物检疫，加强植物保护工作奠定基础。
    为了及时解决调查中的技术问题，这个省的农业厅还建立了病、虫、杂草鉴定委员会，编印了调查手册，和组织调查人员分别进行短期的学习。　（杨蕃）]
