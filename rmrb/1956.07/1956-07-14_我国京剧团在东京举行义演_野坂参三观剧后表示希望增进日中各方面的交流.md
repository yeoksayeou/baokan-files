Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, July 13th: The Chinese Peking Opera Delegation to Japan held two benefit performances at the "International Theater" in Tokyo on the 12th to aid orphans and atomic bomb victims of the war in Japan. The benefit performances were co-sponsored by the "Asahi Shimbun."

As soon as the theater opened, tens of thousands of people poured into the theater. They were workers, office staff, farmers, young students, and housewives from Tokyo and nearby urban and rural areas. The two performances were attended by more than 11,000 people.

The audience, which filled the theater, responded to each program with thunderous applause and cheers. Finally, representatives from six units, including the "Asahi Shimbun," the Shochiku Company (which operates film and theater businesses), and the Japan-China Friendship Association, presented flowers to the delegation on behalf of the Japanese people to express their gratitude.

After watching the performance, Nozaka Sanzō, First Secretary of the Japanese Communist Party, said: The visit and performance of the Chinese Peking Opera Troupe to Japan to introduce outstanding Chinese classical art to the Japanese people, especially the opportunity to give the broad masses a chance to see the opera today, is of great significance. All the audience who watched the Peking Opera were charmed by the opera and deeply moved. He also said that the Peking Opera Troupe's performance in Japan and the Japanese "Kabuki" performance in China have the same great effect on promoting cultural exchanges between China and Japan, restoring diplomatic relations between the two countries, and promoting the friendly relations between the two peoples. He hopes that exchanges between China and Japan in all aspects will develop further in the future.

After the performance, Nozaka Sanzō made a special trip backstage to pay his respects to Mei Lanfang and asked Mei Lanfang to convey his and the Japanese people's gratitude to Chairman Mao Zedong, Chairman Liu Shaoqi, and Premier Zhou Enlai after returning to China.

On behalf of the entire delegation, Mei Lanfang expressed his gratitude to the Japanese people for their help to the delegation and congratulated Nozaka Sanzō on his election as a member of the House of Councillors.

On the day of the benefit performance, the Chinese Peking Opera Troupe also received a letter of thanks from Takeo Ito, Secretary-General of the Japan-China Friendship Association. The letter said: The Peking Opera Troupe's performances in various places in Japan will play a significant role in the Japan-China friendship movement. He expressed his gratitude on behalf of the Japanese people for the Chinese people's friendly sincerity.

    我国京剧团在东京举行义演
    野坂参三观剧后表示希望增进日中各方面的交流
    据新华社东京13日电　中国访日京剧代表团十二日在东京“国际剧场”为救济日本的战争中的孤儿和原子弹受害者举行了两场义演。这次义演是在和“朝日新闻社”共同主持下举行的。
    剧场刚开门，成千上万的人源源不绝地涌进剧场来。他们都是东京和附近城乡的工人、机关职员、农民、青年学生和家庭妇女。两场观众达到一万一千多人。
    挤满了剧场的观众，对每一个节目都报以雷鸣般的掌声和欢呼声。最后由“朝日新闻”社、经营电影和戏剧事业的松竹公司、日中友好协会等六个单位代表日本人民向代表团献花致谢。
    日本共产党第一书记野坂参三看完戏以后说：中国京剧团前来日本访问演出，向日本人民介绍优秀的中国古典艺术，尤其是今天特地给了广大群众看戏的机会，这个意义是非常大的。看过京剧的所有观众都被京剧的魅力迷住，受到深刻的感动。他还说：京剧代表团到日本演出和日本“歌舞伎”曾经在中国演出，同样地对促进中日两国文化交流，恢复两国邦交和两国人民的友好关系有很大的作用。希望今后中日两国各方面的交流，更向前发展。
    在演出终了后，野坂参三还特意到后台向梅兰芳致意问候，并且请梅兰芳回国后向毛泽东主席、刘少奇委员长、周恩来总理转达他和日本人民的谢意。
    梅兰芳代表全团对日本人民给予代表团的帮助表示感谢，并且对野坂参三这次当选国会参议员表示祝贺。
    中国京剧团在义演这一天，还接到了日中友好协会事务总长伊藤武雄的感谢信。信上说：京剧团这次在日本各地公演，对日中友好运动将起重大的作用。他代表日本人民对中国人民的友好的诚意表示感谢。
