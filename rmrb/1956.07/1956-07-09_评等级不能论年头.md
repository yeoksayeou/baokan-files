    Grade Evaluation Should Not Be Based on Seniority
    I work at the Eleventh Engineering Division of the Shenyang Infrastructure Bureau of the Ministry of Electric Power Industry. The responsible comrades of our engineering division said at the wage reform report meeting that this wage reform is "not based on seniority, nor on ranking by age; it mainly depends on whether the technology has truly improved." But in reality, it is exactly the opposite. Those who joined in 1952 are all Grade 6 workers, those who joined in 1953 are all Grade 5 workers, and those who joined in 1954 are all Grade 3 workers. Therefore, everyone is talking about it. Some comrades say: "No matter how high your skill is, if you haven't been here long enough, there is no hope of getting a raise." One worker got so angry about not getting a raise that he refused to work. The leading cadres on the construction site did not ask about his technical skills but gave the worker a raise. I think it is wrong to base it on seniority, and it is also wrong to make unprincipled concessions. (Li Mianyin)

    评等级不能论年头
    我在电力工业部沈阳基建局十一工程处工作。我们工程处负责同志在工资改革的报告会上说，这次工资改革是“不分年头，也不是排辈式，主要是看技术是不是真正的提高了”。实际上恰恰相反。1952年参加的完全是六级工、1953年参加的完全是五级工、1954年参加的完全是三级工。因此，大家议论纷纷。有的同志说：“你的技术再高，年头不到，也没有升级的希望。”有一个工人因为没有升级就大发雷霆，不干工作，工地领导干部也不问技术高低，给那个工人升了一级。我认为论年头是不对的，无原则的迁就也是错误的。　（李面印）
