    To meet foreign needs, Hangzhou is increasing silk production.
    (Our newspaper reports) Hangzhou's silk weaving industry will increase the production of silk for export by 679,600 meters in the second half of this year. Among the increased production of silk, most are plain taffeta, rayon brocade, rayon antique satin, and other fabrics that are extremely popular in foreign markets. The increased production of plain taffeta is almost three times the original plan. After these export silks are exported, they can earn the country more than 11,000 tons of steel.
    Silk factories with increased production tasks will make all preparations before the 10th of this month. The Hangzhou Cotton Textile Industry Professional Company has transferred more than 1,000 outstanding workers and more than 100 looms to support the silk weaving industry. The pattern workers' production cooperative, which specializes in designing silk patterns, has designed many novel and beautiful patterns to make these export silks more beautiful and colorful.

    满足国外需要，杭州增产绸缎
    本报讯　杭州市丝织工业今年下半年将增加生产外销绸缎六十七万九千六百公尺。增产的绸缎中，大部分是素塔夫绸、人造丝织锦缎、人造丝古香缎等在国外市场上极受欢迎的织物。素塔夫绸的增产数量比原定的计划多了将近三倍。这些外销绸缎出口后，可以给国家换回一万一千多吨钢铁。
    有增产任务的绸厂，将在本月十日以前做好各项准备工作。杭州市棉织工业专业公司，已经抽调一千多名优秀工人和一百多台织机支援丝织工业。专门为绸缎设计花色图案的纹工生产合作社，已经设计了许多新颖美丽的图案，使这些外销绸缎更加美丽多彩。
