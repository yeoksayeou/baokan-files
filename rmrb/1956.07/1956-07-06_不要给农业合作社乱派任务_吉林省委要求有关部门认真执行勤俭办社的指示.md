Do not randomly assign tasks to agricultural cooperatives
Jilin Provincial Party Committee Requires Relevant Departments to Conscientiously Implement the Instruction of Running Cooperatives Thriftily

(This newspaper dispatch) Changchun – The Jilin Provincial Party Committee's Rural Work Department recently inspected the situation of some agricultural production cooperatives and found that some administrative and business departments were blindly assigning tasks and requisitioning labor from the cooperatives, causing the cooperative cadres to be busy and chaotic, and seriously wasting manpower and financial resources. For example, the Dunhua Road Maintenance Section of the Jilin Railway Bureau required the Wuyi Agricultural Cooperative of Xin'nong Township, Jiaohe County, to plant trees along the roadside during the busy farming season. The Shuangyang County Tax Bureau, for the convenience of tax collection, stipulated that each agricultural cooperative should set up a slaughterhouse according to the natural village. The Yanji County Postal and Telecommunications Bureau stipulated that the Liming Agricultural Cooperative should have two rural postmen detached from agricultural production, and the cooperative should provide labor remuneration. Some business departments or administrative departments added administrative work to the agricultural cooperative cadres, handling everything, big and small. For example, issuing loans, promoting public bonds, resettling demobilized and transferred soldiers, purchasing live pigs, preventive injections and children's vaccinations, civil mediation, rural taxation, household registration migration, marriage registration, issuing oil coupons, food coupons, and cloth coupons, etc., all had to be handled by the agricultural production cooperative cadres. Some agricultural cooperatives had to designate a director to specifically deal with these "errands." Some business departments blindly issued various survey forms, making the agricultural cooperative accountants busy all day filling out forms not required by the cooperative, unable to do accounting work. Therefore, currently about 30-50% of the agricultural cooperatives in the province have not settled their old accounts or established new accounts; as for missed accounts and incorrect accounts, they are even more common. The phenomenon of forcibly selling goods and publications, regardless of whether the agricultural cooperatives need them or not, is also very serious.

The Jilin Provincial Party Committee issued a notice to relevant departments, pointing out that this practice of randomly assigning tasks to agricultural production cooperatives violates the spirit of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council's instructions on running cooperatives thriftily, and seriously affects the agricultural production cooperatives' plan to increase production and increase income. The Jilin Provincial Party Committee requires leading comrades of party committees, governments, party groups, and various departments at all levels to conduct another careful inspection based on the instructions of the Central Committee and the State Council, and strengthen education for all cadres, explaining that the spirit of actively completing tasks is good, but one cannot carry out work with a one-sided and partial view of tasks. The Provincial Party Committee also pointed out: whether cooperative members want to buy things, subscribe to newspapers, or want to watch movies is entirely their own freedom; any act of forced sales is illegal.

### 不要给农业合作社乱派任务  吉林省委要求有关部门认真执行勤俭办社的指示

    不要给农业合作社乱派任务
    吉林省委要求有关部门认真执行勤俭办社的指示
    本报讯　中共吉林省委农村工作部，最近检查了一些农业生产合作社的情况，发现有些行政部门和业务部门向合作社盲目摊派任务，征用人力，以致合作社干部忙乱不堪，人力财力严重浪费。如吉林铁路管理局敦化养路段，要蛟河县新农乡五一农业社在农忙时候在路旁造林。双阳县税务局为了收税方便，规定每个农业社按自然屯设立屠宰所。延吉县邮电局规定黎明农业社要有两名脱离农业生产的乡邮递员，并且由合作社给劳动报酬。有些业务部门或行政部门把行政工作加到农业社干部身上，大事小事，样样都做。如发放贷款，推销公债，安置复员转业军人，收购生猪，预防注射和小孩种痘，民事调解，农村税收，户口迁移，结婚登记，发放油票粮票布票等等，都要农业生产合作社干部代办。有的农业社不得不指定一名主任专门应付这些“差事”。有些业务部门盲目增发各种调查表格，使农业社会计成天忙于填写非本社所需的表报，不能做会计工作。因此，全省目前约有30—50％的农业社旧账没有结清，新账没有建立；至于漏账、差账，更是普遍现象。不问农业社需要与否，硬性推销物品、书刊的现象也很严重。
    中共吉林省委向有关部门发出通知，指出这种向农业生产合作社乱派任务的作法，违背了中共中央和国务院关于勤俭办社指示的精神，严重地影响农业生产合作社增加生产增加收入的计划。吉林省委要求各级党委、政府、党组和各部门的领导同志，根据中央和国务院的指示，再进行一次认真的检查，并加强对全体干部的教育，说清积极地去完成任务的精神是好的，但不能用片面的局部的任务观点进行工作。省委还指出：合作社社员要不要购买东西、订阅报纸，愿不愿看电影，完全有他们自己的自由；任何强派硬售的作法，都是非法的。
