Xinhua News Agency, 9th: U.S. Vice President Nixon arrived in Taiwan on the evening of the 7th for a 20-hour visit. Nixon's activities demonstrate that the United States is concerned about the impact of the Chinese government's recent proposal for the peaceful liberation of Taiwan and is trying to stabilize the Chiang Kai-shek clique, which is restless day and night.

    On the night of his arrival in Taipei, Nixon handed Chiang Kai-shek a letter written by U.S. President Eisenhower. In the letter, Eisenhower stated that there should be "no misunderstanding" about the United States' "firm and continued support" for the Chiang Kai-shek clique. Eisenhower also wanted Chiang Kai-shek to continue to maintain the "characteristic" of "close cooperation" with the United States.

    On the morning of the 8th, Nixon and Chiang Kai-shek held talks. According to Nixon at a press conference after the talks, they discussed the Chiang Kai-shek clique's problems and its problems in Taiwan, as well as the problems in the overall Asian situation. Nixon said he was "particularly concerned" about Chiang Kai-shek's reaction to China and the Soviet Union's "new strategies."

    At the press conference, Nixon revealed that the United States deliberately delayed holding talks between the foreign ministers of China and the United States. He said, "I know there is no situation for such talks, nor is there any plan to discuss such talks." "I do not anticipate the possibility of such negotiations."

    Referring to the book "Inside Story" by "New York Herald Tribune" reporter Donovan, Nixon said that Donovan "leaves the impression in his book that President Eisenhower once believed that the door should be opened to recognizing Communist China and accepting it into the United Nations." He said, "Based on what I have heard and seen, it is absurd to say that Eisenhower ever expressed at a high-level meeting of his government that he believed we should change our opposition to recognizing Communist China and opposing its admission to the United Nations."

    美国对我和平解放台湾的建议感到担心
    尼克松在台湾安抚蒋介石集团
    据新华社9日讯　美国副总统尼克松曾经在七日晚到达台湾进行了二十小时的访问。尼克松的活动说明，美国对中国政府最近提出的和平解放台湾的建议所产生的影响感到担心，竭力想稳定日夜不安的蒋介石集团。
    尼克松在到达台北的当天深夜，把美国总统艾森豪威尔写的一封信交给了蒋介石。艾森豪威尔在信中表示，对于美国“坚决地继续支持”蒋介石集团这一点，“不容有任何的误解”。艾森豪威尔还要蒋介石继续保持和美国“紧密合作”的“特点”。
    八日上午，尼克松和蒋介石举行了会谈。据尼克松在会谈后举行的记者招待会上透露，他们讨论了蒋介石集团的问题以及它在台湾的问题，还讨论了整个亚洲局势中的问题。尼克松说，他“特别关心”蒋介石对于中国和苏联的“新策略”的反应。
    在记者招待会上，尼克松透露，美国方面蓄意拖延举行中美两国外交部长级会谈。他说，“我知道没有这种会谈的形势，也没有计划商及这种会谈。”“我预料没有这种谈判的可能”。
    尼克松在谈到“纽约先驱论坛报”记者杜诺万所著“内幕故事”一书时说，杜诺万在他的书中“给人留下这样的印象：艾森豪威尔总统一度认为应当敞开承认共产党中国和接纳它参加联合国的大门”。他说，“根据我所听到的和看到的来说，说艾森豪威尔任何时候曾经在他的政府的高级会议上表示过他认为我们应当改变我们反对承认共产党中国和反对接纳它参加联合国的任何说法都是荒谬的。”
