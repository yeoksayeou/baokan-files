Xinhua News Agency, Washington, July 13th: US Democratic Senator Mansfield, who recently traveled extensively in the Far East, delivered a lengthy speech in the Senate on July 12th, calling for a comprehensive re-evaluation of US policy in the Far East. He believes that the policies implemented by the United States are increasingly losing popular support in Asia, and therefore it is now necessary to seek the reasons for this outcome.

Mansfield believes that the current policies pursued by the US government in the Far East contain the danger of leading to war. He said that the Eisenhower administration is "more recklessly" "gambling with the risk of large-scale war" in the Far East than the previous Democratic administration. After pointing out the instability of the Korean armistice, Mansfield said, "In Taiwan, there is a situation that is even more dangerous than this. The United States has said more than it has used wisdom on the Taiwan issue, and published more news than it has taken decisive action."

Mansfield expressed concern about the recent deterioration of US relations with the Philippines and Japan.

Mansfield also said: "Most notably, tensions have arisen in relations with Japan. The Japanese have not yet developed their own defense forces. But in Japan, there is a growing resentment of continuing to rely on the United States for defense. The Japanese are still striving to demand the return of the Ogasawara Islands and Okinawa... In addition, they are also expressing increasing impatience with the restrictions placed on their trade with Communist China."

In his speech, Mansfield did not offer any specific suggestions on changing US policy toward the Far East. He only warned that "US policy toward the Far East or any region cannot be based on slick rhetoric and clever empty talk," but must proceed from "US interests in the Far East."

    美参议员曼斯菲尔德不满美国在远东进行战争赌博
    据新华社13日讯　华盛顿消息：最近曾经在远东广泛旅行的美国民主党参议员曼斯菲尔德七月十二日在参议院发表长篇演说，要求全面地重新估计美国在远东的政策。他认为，美国所实行的政策在亚洲愈来愈失去人心，因此现在必须寻求产生这种结果的原因。
    曼斯菲尔德认为，美国政府目前在远东奉行的政策包含着导致战争的危险。他说，艾森豪威尔政府比以前的民主党政府“更加鲁莽地”在远东“冒大规模战争的危险来进行赌博”。曼斯菲尔德在指出朝鲜停战的不稳定以后说，“在台湾，存在着一种比这更危险的局势。美国在台湾问题上所讲的话比使用的智慧要多，发表的新闻比决策行动要多。”
    曼斯菲尔德对美国最近同菲律宾和日本的关系恶化表示忧虑。
    曼斯菲尔德还说：“最值得注意的是在同日本的关系中发生了紧张状态。日本人还没有发展起自己的防御部队。但是在日本却滋长着一种日益强烈的对于在防务方面继续依靠美国的愤慨。日本人还在竭力要求归还小笠原群岛和冲绳岛……此外还表示对于他们同共产党中国的贸易所受到的限制愈来愈感到不耐烦”。
    曼斯菲尔德在演说中并没有提出什么关于改变美国对远东政策的具体建议。他只是警告说，“美国对远东或任何地区的政策不能以油腔滑调的时髦话和巧妙的空话为根据”，而必须从“美国在远东的利益”出发。
