    帮助失业知识分子就业
    广西各地举办训练班
    本报讯　自今年初中央提出了知识分子问题以来，中共广西省委和广西省人民委员会的各级组织，都全面地加强了对知识分子的工作，对于社会上尚未就业的一部分知识分子，也积极地采取了各种措施，帮助他们就业。
    目前，广西省直属各单位，已按工业交通、农林水利、财经贸易、文化教育等系统，分别训练了失业知识分子共二百余人，各专区、市也分别训练了失业知识分子共约一千人。省直属单位和各专区、市的训练班，多数已经在六月间开办，少部分将在七月间陆续举办。训练班的教学内容主要是我国宪法、五年计划、国际与国内形势等，通过这种学习，要求学员能提高爱国主义觉悟。训练期间一般是五十天左右，训练结束后，将根据国家需要和受训者的专长，分配工作。
