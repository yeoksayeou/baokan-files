Xinhua News Agency, July 5th. TASS Moscow Dispatch: "Pravda" published on July 2nd the Resolution of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union on Overcoming the Cult of Personality and Its Consequences. The full text is as follows:

(I)
The Central Committee of the CPSU notes with satisfaction that the resolutions of the historically significant 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union have been fully endorsed and enthusiastically supported by our entire party, the entire Soviet people, all fraternal communist and workers' parties, the working people of the socialist countries family, and millions of people in capitalist and colonial countries. This is understandable because the 20th Party Congress, marking a new stage in the creative development of Marxism-Leninism, made a profound analysis of the current international and domestic situation, armed the Communist Party and the entire Soviet people with a magnificent plan to continue the struggle to build communism, and opened up new prospects for all working-class parties to work together to prevent the threat of a new war and safeguard the interests of the working people.

Under the leadership of the Communist Party, the Soviet people have achieved new and remarkable successes in all aspects of the country's political, economic, and cultural life in implementing the resolutions of the 20th Congress of the CPSU. The Soviet people are more closely united around the Communist Party and have demonstrated a high degree of creative initiative in the struggle to fulfill the tasks put forward by the 20th Congress.

The period since the Congress has also shown the great vitality of the Congress's resolutions for the international communist and workers' movement, and for the struggle of all progressive forces to consolidate world peace. The important principled theories put forward by the Congress on the peaceful coexistence of countries with different social systems, on the possibility of preventing wars in modern times, and on the diversity of forms of transition to socialism in various countries, have had a positive impact on the international situation, promoted the relaxation of tensions, strengthened the unity of action of all forces fighting for peace and democracy, and further consolidated the positions of the world socialist system.

The historically significant resolutions of the 20th Congress of the CPSU have aroused vigorous enthusiasm, new and vigorous creative initiative, and revolutionary determination among the Soviet people, in the people's democracies, and among the working people of the world, while causing panic and resentment in the camp of the enemies of the working class. Reactionary groups in the United States and some other capitalist countries are clearly disturbed by the great program for the struggle to consolidate peace formulated by the 20th Congress of the CPSU. Their unease continues to increase as this program is actively implemented step by step.

Why are the enemies of communism and socialism focusing their fire on the shortcomings mentioned by our Party Central Committee at the 20th Congress of the CPSU? They do so in order to divert the attention of the working class and working-class parties, preventing them from paying attention to the main issues raised at the 20th Congress, which cleared the way for new achievements in the cause of peace, socialism, and working-class unity.

The resolutions of the Party's 20th Congress and the Soviet government's foreign and domestic policies have thrown the imperialist groups in the United States and other countries into disarray.

The bold and consistent foreign policy pursued by the Soviet Union in guaranteeing peace and cooperation between all countries (regardless of their social systems) has won the support of the broadest masses of people in all countries, expanded the front of peace-loving countries, and caused a profound crisis in the policies of "cold war," the formation of military blocs, and the expansion of armaments. It is no accident that the imperialist groups in the United States are making a great uproar around the Soviet Union's struggle against the cult of personality. The existence of negative phenomena associated with the cult of personality is beneficial to them because they can use these facts to oppose socialism. Now, when our party is courageously overcoming the consequences of the cult of personality, the imperialist elements see this as a factor that accelerates our country's advance towards communism and weakens the position of capitalism.

Capitalist ideologues are trying to weaken the great appeal of the resolutions of the 20th Congress of the CPSU and its influence on the broad masses of people, and therefore adopt various conspiracies to divert the attention of the working people, preventing them from seeing the progressive and encouraging ideas put forward by the socialist world to all mankind.

Recently, the bourgeois press has carried out extensive slanderous anti-Soviet propaganda, and reactionaries have attempted to use some facts related to the Soviet Communist Party's criticism of the cult of personality of J.V. Stalin as a reason for carrying out this slander. The planners of this anti-Soviet propaganda have tried to "muddy the waters," trying to conceal the fact that the facts now revealed belong to the past stages of Soviet state life; they also want to evade and distort the following point: in the years after Stalin's death, the Soviet Communist Party and the Soviet government have eliminated the consequences of the cult of personality with extraordinary decisiveness and determination, successfully implementing new tasks that are beneficial to consolidating peace and building communism, and beneficial to the broad masses of people.

Bourgeois ideologues have launched slanderous propaganda, once again vainly attempting to slander the great ideas of Marxism-Leninism, undermine the trust of the working people in the world's first socialist country—the Soviet Union, and create chaos in the ranks of the international communist and workers' movement.

Historical experience shows that the enemies of proletarian international solidarity have not only once attempted to take advantage of what they considered to be good opportunities to undermine the internationalist unity of communist and workers' parties, split the international workers' movement, and weaken the strength of the socialist camp. However, communist and workers' parties have always seen through the conspiracies of the enemies of socialism, more closely united their ranks, and demonstrated their unbreakable political unity and unwavering loyalty to the ideas of Marxism-Leninism.

The fraternal communist and workers' parties have also timely seen through the conspiracies of the enemies of socialism this time and given them the due rebuff. However, it is also incorrect to close our eyes to the fact that some of our foreign friends have not thoroughly understood the issue of the cult of personality and its consequences, and sometimes made incorrect interpretations of some situations related to the cult of personality.

The Party's criticism of the cult of personality proceeds from Marxist-Leninist principles. For more than three years, our party has unswervingly opposed the cult of personality of J.V. Stalin and resolutely overcome the harmful consequences of the cult of personality. It is natural that this issue occupies an important position in the work and resolutions of the 20th Congress of the CPSU. The Congress pointed out that the Central Committee's opposition to the cult of personality was completely correct and timely; the prevalence of the cult of personality reduced the role of the Party and the masses of people, reduced the role of the Party's collective leadership, and often brought serious losses to the work and caused the socialist legal system to be brutally violated. The Congress instructed the Central Committee to unswervingly implement various measures to ensure the complete overcoming of the cult of personality, which is incompatible with Marxism-Leninism, eliminate the influence of the cult of personality in all aspects of the Party's work, state work, and ideological work, and strictly implement the norms of inner-party life and the principles of collective leadership of the Party formulated by the great Lenin.

In the struggle against the cult of personality, the Party follows the Marxist-Leninist view on the role of the masses of people, the Party, and individuals in history, and the famous argument that no matter how great the merits of political leaders are, personal worship of them is not allowed. Karl Marx, the founder of scientific communism, emphasized his aversion to "any cult of personality," saying that his and Engels' participation in the Communist League was "conditional on the deletion of everything in the statutes that promoted blind worship of authority." (Complete Works of Marx and Engels, First Edition, Volume 26, pages 487-488)

When creating our Communist Party, V.I. Lenin waged an irreconcilable struggle against the anti-Marxist views of so-called "heroes" and "rabble," and resolutely condemned setting individual heroes against the masses of people. Lenin said, "What is created by the wisdom of millions of creators is infinitely superior to the foresight of the greatest genius." (Complete Works of Lenin, Volume 26, page 431)

The Central Committee of the CPSU raised the issue of opposition to the cult of personality of Stalin based on the fact that the cult of personality violates the essence of the socialist system, hinders the development of Soviet democracy, and hinders the Soviet society's advance towards communism.

Based on the initiative of the Central Committee, the Party's 20th Congress believed that it was necessary to boldly and openly explain the serious consequences of the cult of personality and the serious mistakes made by Stalin in the later period of his life, and called on the entire Party to work together to eradicate all the consequences caused by the cult of personality. The Central Committee knew that frank admission of the mistakes made would allow the enemy to take advantage of loopholes. The bold and ruthless self-criticism on the issue of the cult of personality once again demonstrated the strength and consolidation of our Party and the Soviet socialist system. It can be said with certainty that no ruling party in a capitalist country would dare to do this. On the contrary, they would try their best not to talk about such unpleasant facts and hide such facts from the people. However, the Soviet Communist Party, which was cultivated with Marxist-Leninist revolutionary principles, told the whole truth, no matter how painful it was. The Party took this step proactively based entirely on principled considerations. The Party believes that if the action against the worship of Stalin causes some temporary difficulties, then, from the fundamental interests and ultimate goals of the working class, there will be huge and good results in the future. Because doing so can reliably ensure that similar phenomena of the cult of personality will never occur in our Party and country in the future, guarantee collective leadership of the Party and the country in the future on the basis of implementing Marxist-Leninist policies, developing inner-party democracy, and with the active participation of millions of working people, and vigorously developing Soviet democracy.

The Party resolutely opposes the cult of personality and its consequences, and openly criticizes the mistakes caused by the cult of personality, thus once again demonstrating its loyalty to the immortal principles of Marxism-Leninism, its loyalty to the interests of the people, and its concern for creating the most favorable conditions for developing inner-party democracy and Soviet democracy, in order to smoothly build communism in our country.

The Central Committee of the CPSU confirms that when discussing the issue of the cult of personality and its consequences in party organizations at all levels and in the congresses of the working people, both party members and non-party members actively participated, and the line of the Central Committee of the CPSU has been fully approved and supported by the Party and the people.

The facts publicized by the Party about the destruction of the socialist legal system and other mistakes related to the cult of personality of Stalin are of course painful and deeply regrettable. But Soviet people understand that it is necessary to condemn the cult of personality for the benefit of the communist construction in which they are actively participating. The Soviet people see that the Party has firmly taken practical measures in recent years to eliminate the consequences caused by the cult of personality in all aspects of the Party, the state, the economy, and cultural construction. As a result of this work, the Party's strength is now no longer bound by anything, the Party is closer to the people, and the creative initiative within the Party has been unprecedentedly improved.

(II)
Under the conditions of the Soviet socialist system, how could the cult of personality of Stalin occur and become popular, causing various negative consequences?

When examining this issue, we should take into account both the specific objective historical conditions in which the Soviet socialist construction was located and some subjective factors related to Stalin's personal qualities.

The October Socialist Revolution is recorded in history as a model for completing the revolutionary transformation of capitalist society under the leadership of the working class. Communist parties in other countries, and all progressive and democratic forces, learn from the heroic struggle of the Bolshevik Party, and from the example of the world's first socialist country—the Soviet Union—the experience of solving the fundamental social problems raised by modern social development. In nearly forty years of socialist social construction, our working people have accumulated a great deal of experience, which the working people of other socialist countries are studying and creatively applying in combination with the specific conditions of their own countries.

This is the first experience in history of building a socialist society. This society was formed in the process of exploring and practically testing many truths, before which socialists only knew a rough outline of these truths in theory. For more than twenty-five years, the Soviet state was the only country that opened up the road to socialism for mankind. It was like a fortress besieged in a capitalist encirclement. The enemies of the Soviet state in the West and the East, after the failure of the armed intervention of fourteen countries from 1918 to 1920, continued to prepare for a new "crusade" against the Soviet Union. The enemies sent a large number of spies and saboteurs to the Soviet Union, trying every possible way to undermine the world's first socialist country. After fascism seized power in Germany in 1933 and declared its goal to eliminate communism and eliminate the Soviet Union—the world's first country of working people—the threat of a new aggression against the Soviet Union by imperialism was particularly strengthened. The so-called "Anti-Comintern Pact," which was actively supported by the entire international reactionary forces, and the formation of the "Berlin-Rome-Tokyo Axis," are all remembered by everyone. Under the circumstances that the threat of a new war was approaching, and the Western countries rejected the Soviet Union's repeated suggestions on measures to curb fascism and organize collective security, the Soviet state had to do its best to strengthen its national defense and struggle against the conspiracies of hostile capitalist encirclement. The Party had to educate the entire people to maintain vigilance consistently and mobilize them to prepare to deal with external enemies.

At that time, the conspiracies of international reactionary forces were even more dangerous due to the long-term and cruel class struggle being carried out domestically and the resolution of the issue of "who will win." After Lenin's death, hostile factions of Trotskyites, right-wing opportunists, and bourgeois nationalists became active in the Party, and they adopted the position of abandoning Lenin's theory that socialism could be victorious in one country, which would actually lead to the restoration of capitalism in the Soviet Union. The Party launched a ruthless struggle against these enemies of Leninism.

The Communist Party adhered to Lenin's legacy and adopted the policy of socialist industrialization, agricultural collectivization, and the realization of cultural revolution. On the road to solving these extremely huge tasks of building a socialist society in a single country, the Soviet people and the Communist Party needed to overcome many unimaginable difficulties and obstacles. Our country was to eliminate its historical backwardness in an extremely short historical period and transform the entire national economy according to new socialist principles without any external economic assistance.

In this complex international and domestic environment, there was a need for iron discipline, a need to constantly improve vigilance, and a need for extremely strict centralized leadership, which could not but have a bad impact on the development of some democratic forms. In the process of carrying out a cruel struggle against the entire imperialist world, our country had to make some restrictions on democracy, which was correct from the logic of our people's struggle for socialism in the context of imperialist encirclement. However, these restrictions were already regarded by the Party and the people at that time as temporary and should be lifted with the consolidation of the Soviet state and the development of democratic and socialist forces throughout the world. The people saw that the Soviet social system was achieving new successes day by day, and consciously endured this temporary sacrifice.

Under the leadership of the Communist Party and its Central Committee, which implemented Lenin's general line, the Soviet people overcame all these difficulties on the road to building socialism.

Our country's achievement of socialist victory in the context of enemy encirclement and constant threats of external aggression is a contribution of world historical significance, which was made by the Soviet people. Due to the intense labor and heroic efforts of the people and the Party, an economically backward country had a huge leap in its economic and cultural development in the first few five-year plans. On the basis of the achievements of socialist construction, the living standards of the working people improved, and unemployment was eliminated forever. A very profound cultural revolution occurred domestically. In a short period of time, a large number of technical cadres grew up from among the Soviet people; they reached the level of world technological development, making Soviet science and technology at the forefront of the world. The great Communist Party is the inspirer and organizer of these victories. The working people of the world see through the example of the Soviet Union that workers and peasants, after gaining political power, can victoriously build and develop their own socialist state without capitalists and landlords, reflecting and protecting the interests of the broad masses of people. All this has played a great inspiring role in expanding the influence of communist and workers' parties in various countries around the world.

J.V. Stalin served as the General Secretary of the Party Central Committee for a long time, and he actively struggled with other leaders to realize Lenin's legacy. He was loyal to Marxism-Leninism, and as a theorist and great organizer, he led the Party's struggle against the Trotskyites, right-wing opportunists, and bourgeois nationalists, as well as the struggle against the conspiracies of capitalist encirclement. In this political and ideological struggle, Stalin gained great prestige and reputation. However, all our great victories have since been incorrectly linked to his name. The achievements of the Communist Party and the Soviet state, as well as the praise for Stalin, made him dizzy. Under such circumstances, the cult of personality of Stalin began to gradually form.

Some of J.V. Stalin's personal qualities greatly contributed to the development of the cult of personality. V.I. Lenin once pointed out Stalin's bad character. At the end of 1922, Lenin said in his letter to that Party congress:

"Comrade Stalin, having become General Secretary, has concentrated an enormous power in his hands; and I am not sure that he always knows how to use that power with sufficient caution." In early January 1923, Lenin again mentioned in the supplementary opinion of this letter some of Stalin's personal qualities that were intolerable for leaders. Lenin wrote: "Stalin is too rude, and this defect is quite tolerable among us communists in dealing with one another, but it becomes intolerable in a General Secretary. That is why I suggest the comrades think about a way of removing Stalin from that post and appointing another man in his stead who in all other respects differs from Comrade Stalin in having only one advantage, namely, that of being more patient, gentler and more polite to comrades, less capricious, etc."

At the Party's Thirteenth Congress held shortly after Lenin's death, Lenin's letters were read out among the delegations. As a result of the discussion of these documents, everyone believed that it would be best to let Stalin continue to serve as General Secretary, but to ask him to consider Lenin's criticism and draw all the necessary conclusions from it.

After Stalin remained as the General Secretary of the Central Committee, he still valued Lenin's criticisms in the early period after Lenin's death. But later, Stalin overestimated his own merits too much and believed that he would not make mistakes. Under the conditions of a fierce struggle with class enemies and their pawns, and later in the war against German fascist bandits, some restrictions on inner-party democracy and Soviet democracy were inevitable, but Stalin began to turn these restrictions into the norms of inner-party life and state life, and brutally trampled on Lenin's principles of leadership. The Central Plenary Sessions and Party Congresses were not held regularly, and later were not held at all for many years. Stalin actually placed himself outside of criticism.

Stalin's erroneous formula that the further the Soviet Union advances towards socialism, the sharper the class struggle becomes, caused great harm to the cause of socialist construction and to the development of democracy within the Party and the country. This formula was only correct in a certain stage of the transition period, when resolving the issue of "who will win," when carrying out a tenacious class struggle to build the foundations of socialism; however, in 1937, when socialism had already won in our country, and when the exploiting classes and their economic foundations had been eliminated, this formula was raised to the forefront. In practice, this erroneous theoretical formula became the argument for brutally destroying the socialist legal system and carrying out large-scale repression.

It was precisely under such circumstances that the special status of state security organs was formed, and these organs were greatly trusted because they had undeniable merits for the people and the country in defending the achievements of the revolution. For a long period of time, state security organs did not betray this trust, and their special status did not cause any danger. However, when the Party and government's supervision of these organs was gradually replaced by Stalin's personal supervision, and the usual judicial norms were often replaced by his personal decisions, things changed. The situation became even more complicated after the heinous gang of Beria, the agent of international imperialism, usurped the leadership of the state security organs. The Soviet legal system was seriously damaged, and large-scale repression occurred. Due to the conspiracies of the enemies, many honest communist party members and non-party Soviet people were falsely accused and innocently suffered.

The Party's 20th Congress and the entire policy implemented by the Central Committee after Stalin's death clearly prove that there is a formed Leninist leadership core within the Party Central Committee, which correctly understands the mature requirements in domestic and foreign affairs. It cannot be said that there was no opposition to those negative phenomena related to the cult of personality that hindered the socialist progress. And in certain periods, for example, during the war, Stalin's arbitrariness was greatly restricted, and negative phenomena such as illegalities and autocracy were greatly reduced.

Everyone knows that it was precisely during the war that the members of the Central Committee and the outstanding Soviet generals took the work of some parts of the rear and the front into their own hands, independently made decisions, and together with the local party organizations and Soviet organs, ensured the victory of the Soviet people in the war with their work in organization, politics, economy, and military affairs. After the victory, the negative effects of the cult of personality became more serious.

The Leninist core of the Central Committee immediately began a resolute struggle against the cult of personality and its serious consequences after Stalin's death.

Perhaps it is necessary to ask: why did these people not openly oppose Stalin and remove him from his leading position? Under the circumstances that had been formed at that time, it was impossible to do so. Of course, the facts show that Stalin was responsible for many illegal phenomena, especially those that occurred in the later period of his life. But at the same time, it cannot be forgotten that Stalin was in the minds of Soviet people a person who always protected the Soviet Union, opposed the conspiracies of the enemies, and always struggled for the cause of socialism. In this struggle, he sometimes adopted inappropriate methods, undermining Leninist principles and norms of inner-party life. Stalin's tragedy lies here. However, all this also made the struggle against the illegal phenomena that occurred at that time difficult, because the achievements of building socialism and consolidating the Soviet Union were attributed to Stalin under the influence of the cult of personality.

Under such circumstances, any opposition to him would not be understood by the people, and the issue here is not entirely about insufficient personal courage. Obviously, whoever opposed Stalin under such circumstances would not receive the support of the people. Moreover, under that situation, such actions would be considered actions against the cause of socialist construction, and extremely dangerous actions that would undermine the unity of the Party and the entire country in the environment of capitalist encirclement. At the same time, the achievements made by the Soviet working people under the leadership of their own Communist Party gave rise to a reasonable sense of pride in the hearts of every Soviet person, and created an atmosphere in which individual errors and shortcomings appeared secondary against the backdrop of great achievements; and in fact, the negative consequences caused by these errors were quickly overshadowed by the vibrant forces that were rapidly growing up in the Party and Soviet society.

It should also be noted that many facts and Stalin's incorrect behaviors, especially the behaviors that undermined the Soviet legal system, were only discovered in recent times, after Stalin's death, mainly after the Beria gang was exposed and the Party's supervision of the state security organs was established.

These are the main conditions and reasons for the emergence and popularity of the cult of personality of Stalin. Of course, everything said above is only an explanation for the cult of personality of Stalin and its consequences, and is by no means a defense for them, which has been sharply and fairly condemned by our Party.

(III)
There is no doubt that the cult of personality has caused serious losses to the cause of the Communist Party and Soviet society. However, it would be a serious mistake to draw the conclusion from the fact that the cult of personality existed in the past that the Soviet social system has changed in any way, or to look for the roots of this cult in the essence of the Soviet social system. Both of these ideas are absolutely incorrect. Because this is not in line with the facts and violates the facts.

Despite the fact that the cult of personality of Stalin caused great harm to the Party and the people, it could not change and did not change the essence of our social system. No cult of personality can change the essence of a socialist country, because the foundation of a socialist country is the public ownership of the means of production, the alliance of workers and peasants, and the friendship of all nationalities, although this worship has caused serious damage to the development of socialist democracy and to the unleashing of the creative initiative of millions of people.

To think that individual figures, including such great figures as Stalin, can change our social and political system is to fall into a completely factual, anti-Marxist, and anti-truth situation, falling into idealism. That is to think that individual figures have extraordinary and superhuman powers, capable of changing social systems, and even capable of changing social systems in which millions of working masses play a decisive role.

Everyone knows that what determines the essence of the social and political system is: what kind of mode of production is possessed, to whom the means of production belong in society, and in whose hands political power is held. The whole world knows that in our country, due to the October Revolution and the victory of socialism, a socialist mode of production has been established, and political power has been in the hands of the working class and peasants for nearly forty years. Therefore, the Soviet social system is consolidated year by year, and its productive forces are constantly developing. Even those who are malicious to us cannot but admit this fact.

Everyone knows that due to the consequences of the cult of personality, there have been some serious errors in the leadership of various departments of the Party and the Soviet state, and in the domestic and foreign policies of the Soviet state. For example, it can be pointed out that Stalin made serious mistakes in leading agriculture, in organizing the preparation of the state to resist the fascist aggressors, and his brutal and arbitrary behavior caused the conflict with Yugoslavia in the post-war period. These errors hindered the development of individual aspects of Soviet state life, especially hindered the development of Soviet society in Stalin's later years, but, needless to say, these errors did not lead Soviet society away from the correct path of development towards communism.

Our enemies insist that the cult of personality of Stalin arose not due to certain historical conditions that have become the past, but due to the Soviet system itself, due to (in their opinion) the undemocratic nature of this system, and so on. The entire history of the development of the Soviet state refutes this slander. The Soviets, the new democratic form of state power, were produced on the basis of the revolutionary creation of the broad masses of people fighting for freedom. The Soviets have been and still are the organs of truly people's power. It is precisely the Soviet system that enables the people to exert tremendous creativity. The Soviet system launched the infinite power of the masses of people, attracting millions of people to consciously manage the country and actively and creatively participate in socialist construction. In a short historical period, the Soviet state has withstood the most arduous tests and experienced the tests of the flames of World War II.

When the last exploiting class was eliminated in our country, when socialism became the dominant system in the entire national economy, and when our country's international status underwent fundamental changes, the scope of Soviet democracy was immeasurably expanded and continued to expand. Soviet democracy is different from any bourgeois democracy in that it not only declares, but also materially guarantees all members of society the right to work, be educated, rest, participate in state affairs, freedom of speech, publication, belief, and the actual opportunity to freely develop personal talents and enjoy all other democratic rights and freedoms. The essence of democracy does not lie in formal symbols, but in whether the political power serves the will and fundamental interests of the majority of the masses of people, and the interests of the working people, and whether it actually reflects their will and interests. The entire domestic and foreign policy of the Soviet state shows that our system is a truly democratic and truly people's system. The highest goal and constant concern of the Soviet state is to fully improve the living standards of residents and guarantee the peaceful life of its own people.

The measures taken by the Party and government to expand the powers of the allied republics, strictly abide by the legal system, change the planning system to give play to local initiative, strengthen the activities of local Soviets, and develop criticism and self-criticism are all evidence of the further development of Soviet democracy.

Despite the existence of the cult of personality, the vigorous initiative generated by our system in the masses of people under the leadership of the Communist Party overcame all obstacles on the road to socialist construction and created their own historically significant great cause. This is the highest expression of the democracy of the Soviet socialist system. The brilliant victory of socialism in our country did not come about on its own. The achievement of this victory is due to the huge organizational and educational work carried out by the Party and its local organizations, and it is due to the Party constantly educating its cadres and all communist party members in the spirit of loyalty to Marxism-Leninism and to the spirit of the cause of communism. The strength of Soviet society lies in the consciousness of the masses. Its historical destiny in the past and now is determined by the creative labor of our heroic working class, glorious collective farm members, and people's intellectuals.

Our Party has further strengthened its ties with the broad masses of people and united them more closely under the banner of the great Lenin by eliminating the consequences of the cult of personality, restoring the Bolshevik norms of Party life, and promoting socialist democracy.

The fact that the Party boldly, openly, and automatically raised the issue of eliminating the cult of personality and the intolerable errors committed by Stalin convincingly proves that the Party is firmly protecting Leninism, safeguarding the cause of socialism and communism, safeguarding the socialist legal system and the interests of the people, and guaranteeing the rights of Soviet citizens. This is the best proof of the strength and vitality of the Soviet socialist system. It also demonstrates the determination to completely eliminate the consequences of the cult of personality and never make similar mistakes in the future.

Our Party's criticism of the cult of personality of Stalin and its consequences has been approved and widely responded to by the fraternal communist and workers' parties. Communist parties in various countries have pointed out that the 20th Congress of the CPSU has great significance for the entire international communist and workers' movement, and regard the struggle against the cult of personality and its consequences as a struggle to maintain the purity of Marxist-Leninist principles, to creatively solve the current problems in the international workers' movement, and to establish and further develop the principles of proletarian internationalism.

Many declarations by fraternal communist parties have endorsed and supported the measures taken by our Party against the cult of personality and its consequences. The People's Daily, the organ of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, expounded the conclusions drawn by the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China from discussing the resolutions of the 20th Congress of the CPSU. In the editorial article "On the Historical Experience of the Proletarian Dictatorship," it wrote: "The Soviet Communist Party is following Lenin's legacy and is now seriously dealing with some serious errors committed by Stalin in leading socialist construction and the consequences left behind. Due to the seriousness of its consequences, it is necessary for the Soviet Communist Party to sharply reveal the essence of the errors committed by Stalin while affirming Stalin's great achievements, calling on the entire Party to take this as a warning and resolutely eliminate the negative consequences caused by this error. We Chinese communists firmly believe that after this sharp criticism by the Soviet Communist Party at its 20th Congress, all the positive factors that were seriously suppressed by certain erroneous policies in the past will generally become active, and the Soviet Communist Party and the Soviet people will be more united than in the past, and will strive to build a great communist society that mankind has never seen before and to strive for lasting peace in the world."

The Political Bureau of the French Communist Party stated: "The merit of the leaders of the Soviet Communist Party lies in the measures they have taken to correct the errors and shortcomings related to the cult of personality, which proves the strength and unity of Lenin's great Party, proves the trust it enjoys among the Soviet people, and also demonstrates its prestige in the international workers' movement." Comrade Eugene Dennis, General Secretary of the National Council of the Communist Party of the United States, pointed out the great significance of the 20th Congress of the CPSU in a well-known article, saying: "The 20th Congress strengthened world peace and social progress. It marks a new stage in the development of socialism and the struggle for peaceful coexistence. The struggle for peaceful coexistence began when Lenin was alive, and this struggle has continued ever since, and it has become more and more effective and successful."

At the same time, it should also be pointed out that in the discussion of the issue of the cult of personality, not all explanations of the causes of the cult of personality and the consequences caused by this worship to our social system are correct. For example, in a detailed and noteworthy reply by Comrade Togliatti to the questions of the "New Argument" magazine, in addition to making many extremely important and correct conclusions, it also contains incorrect arguments. For example, one cannot agree with Comrade Togliatti's formulation of the question: has Soviet society moved towards "some form of degeneration"? There is no basis for raising this question. This question is particularly perplexing because Comrade Togliatti correctly stated in another part of his reply: "It must be concluded that the essence of the socialist system has not been lost, because none of the previous achievements, first and foremost the support of the masses of workers, peasants, and intellectuals who make up Soviet society for this system, has been lost. This support itself proves that, in any case, this society has maintained its basic democratic nature."

Indeed, without the support of the broad masses of people for the Soviet regime and for the policies of the Communist Party, our country could not have established a strong socialist industry in an unprecedentedly short period, realized agricultural collectivization, and it could not have won in World War II, which determined the fate of all mankind. Due to the thorough crushing of Hitlerism, Italian fascism, and Japanese militarism, the strength of the communist movement has been widely developed, the communist parties of Italy, France, and other capitalist countries have grown stronger and become mass parties, people's democratic systems have been established in some countries in Europe and Asia, the world socialist system has been established and consolidated, and the national liberation movement that is leading the imperialist colonial system to collapse has achieved unprecedented victory.

(IV)
Communist party members and the entire Soviet people unanimously support the resolutions of the 20th Congress of the Soviet Communist Party criticizing the cult of personality, believing that these resolutions are proof of the growth of our Party's strength, proof of the Party's Leninist principles, and proof of the Party's unity and solidarity. Lenin said: "The revolutionary proletariat's party is strong enough to openly conduct self-criticism and unambiguously call its own mistakes and weaknesses mistakes and weaknesses."

    苏共中央关于克服个人崇拜及其后果的决议
    新华社5日讯　塔斯社莫斯科讯：“真理报”七月二日刊载了苏联共产党中央委员会关于克服个人崇拜及其后果的决议，全文如下：
    （一）
    苏共中央委员会满意地指出，有历史意义的苏联共产党第二十次代表大会的决议，得到了我们全党、全体苏联人民、各兄弟共产党和工人党、社会主义国家大家庭的劳动人民、资本主义国家和殖民地国家的千百万人的完全拥护和热烈支持。这是可以理解的，因为标志着创造性地发展马克思列宁主义的新阶段的第二十次党代表大会，对当前的国际和国内形势作了深刻的分析，用继续为建成共产主义而奋斗的宏伟计划武装了共产党和全体苏联人民，并为一切工人阶级政党共同努力防止新战争威胁、维护劳动人民的利益开辟了新的远景。
    在共产党的领导下，苏联人民在执行苏共第二十次代表大会的决议中，在国家的政治、经济和文化生活各方面取得了新的卓越成就。苏联人民更加紧密地团结在共产党的周围，并且在为完成第二十次代表大会所提出的任务的斗争中表现了高度的创造性积极性。
    代表大会以后的这一段时期也表明了代表大会的决议对国际共产主义运动和工人运动、对一切进步力量为巩固世界和平的斗争具有伟大生命力。代表大会所提出的关于不同社会制度的国家和平共处、关于现代防止战争的可能性、关于各国向社会主义过渡的形式的多样性这些重要原则性的理论，对国际局势有良好的影响，促进了紧张局势的缓和，加强了一切为和平和民主而斗争的力量的行动一致，进一步巩固了世界社会主义体系的阵地。
    苏共第二十次代表大会的有历史意义的决议，在苏联人民中，在各人民民主国家和全世界劳动人民中，引起了蓬勃的热情、新的旺盛的创造性主动性和革命毅力，而在工人阶级的敌人的营垒里，则引起了惊慌和忿恨。美国和其他一些资本主义国家的反动集团对苏共第二十次代表大会所制定的为巩固和平而斗争的伟大纲领，显然感到不安。他们的不安随着这个纲领的积极地逐一地实现而不断增加。
    为什么共产主义和社会主义的敌人要集中火力来攻击我们党中央委员会在苏共第二十次代表大会上所说的缺点呢？他们这样做是为了转移工人阶级和工人阶级政党的视线，使它们不去注意第二十次代表大会上提出的主要问题，这些主要问题为和平、社会主义和工人阶级团结的事业取得新成就扫清了道路。
    党的第二十次代表大会的决议和苏联政府的对外和对内政策，使美国和其他国家的帝国主义集团惊惶失措。
    苏联在保障和平和各国（不问它们的社会制度如何）之间的合作方面所执行的大胆的和一贯的外交政策，得到世界各国最广大的人民群众的支持，扩大了爱好和平国家的阵线，引起了“冷战”政策、拼凑军事集团和扩充军备政策的深刻危机。美国的帝国主义集团围绕着苏联反对个人崇拜的斗争而大肆叫嚣，这不是偶然的。与个人崇拜有关的不良现象的存在，对他们是有利的，因为他们可以利用这些事实来反对社会主义。现在，当我们党勇敢地克服个人崇拜的后果的时候，帝国主义分子看出这是加速我国向共产主义的前进并削弱资本主义阵地的一个因素。
    资本主义的思想家力图削弱苏共第二十次代表大会决议的伟大的吸引力和它对广大人民群众的影响，因而采用种种阴谋诡计来转移劳动人民的视线，使他们看不到社会主义世界向全人类提出的进步的和令人鼓舞的思想。
    最近资产阶级报刊广泛进行污蔑性的反苏宣传，反动派企图利用有关苏联共产党指责对约·维·斯大林的个人崇拜的一些事实来作为进行这种污蔑的理由。这次反苏宣传的策划人竭力“把水搅混”，力图掩饰这一点，即现在揭发的事实是属于苏维埃国家生活中过去的阶段的；他们也想回避和歪曲下列一点：苏联共产党和苏联政府在斯大林逝世后的几年中，以异常的果断和决心来消除个人崇拜的后果，成功地实现着有益于巩固和平和建设共产主义、有益于广大人民群众的新任务。
    资产阶级思想家展开污蔑宣传，再一次妄费心机地中伤马克思列宁主义的伟大思想，破坏劳动人民对世界上第一个社会主义国家——苏联的信任，在国际共产主义运动和工人运动的队伍中制造混乱。
    历史经验说明，无产阶级国际团结的敌人过去不只一次企图利用他们所认为的良机，来破坏共产党和工人党的国际主义团结，分裂国际工人运动，削弱社会主义阵营的力量。但是，共产党和工人党每次都识破了社会主义的敌人的诡计，更紧密地团结了自己的队伍，显示了自己的牢不可破的政治团结和对马克思列宁主义思想的不可动摇的忠诚。
    各兄弟共产党和工人党这次也及时识破了社会主义的敌人的诡计，并且给以应有的回击。然而，闭眼不看下一事实也是不对的：我们的某些外国朋友没有彻底弄清楚个人崇拜及其后果的问题，有时候对有关个人崇拜的某些情况作了不正确的解释。
    党批判个人崇拜是从马克思列宁主义原则出发的。三年多以来，我们党坚持不渝地反对对约·维·斯大林的个人崇拜，坚决克服个人崇拜的有害后果。这个问题在苏共第二十次代表大会的工作和决议中占着重要的地位，这是很自然的。代表大会指出，中央委员会反对个人崇拜是完全正确的，适时的；个人崇拜的流行缩小了党和人民群众的作用，降低了党的集体领导的作用，并且常常给工作带来严重的损失，使社会主义法制遭到粗暴的破坏。代表大会责成中央委员会始终不渝地实行各种措施，以保证完全克服同马克思列宁主义不相容的个人崇拜，肃清个人崇拜在党的工作、国家工作和思想工作各方面的影响，并严格实行伟大的列宁所制定的党内生活准则和党的集体领导原则。
    在反对个人崇拜的斗争中，党遵循着马克思列宁主义关于人民群众、党和个人在历史中的作用，以及不论政治领导者的功绩多大绝不容许对他个人崇拜的有名的论点。科学的共产主义奠基人卡·马克思曾着重指出自己“对任何个人崇拜”的反感，他说，他和恩格斯参加共产主义者团体的“条件就是：章程中一切促成盲目崇拜权威的东西都应该删去”。（马克思恩格斯全集第一版第二十六卷第四八七—四八八页）
    弗·伊·列宁在缔造我们共产党的时候，曾经同所谓“英雄”和“群氓”的反马克思主义观点进行了不调和的斗争，坚决谴责把个人英雄同人民群众对立起来。列宁说，“千百万创造者的智慧所创造的东西，比一个最伟大的天才的预见要高超得无比。”（列宁全集第二十六卷第四三一页）
    苏共中央提出反对对斯大林的个人崇拜的问题是基于这样一点：个人崇拜违反社会主义制度的本质，阻碍苏维埃民主的发展，阻碍苏维埃社会向共产主义前进。
    党的第二十次代表大会根据中央委员会的创议，认为必须大胆和公开地说明个人崇拜的严重后果和斯大林生平的后期所犯的严重错误，号召全党共同努力铲除个人崇拜所引起的一切后果。中央委员会知道，坦白承认所犯的错误将使敌人可能钻空子。在个人崇拜问题上的大胆无情的自我批评，再一次表明我们党和苏维埃社会主义制度的力量和巩固性。可以肯定地说，资本主义国家的任何一个执政党决不敢这样做。相反地，它们将竭力不讲这样的不愉快的事实，向人民隐瞒这种事实。但是以马克思列宁主义革命原则培养出来的苏联共产党说出了全部真实情况，不管它多么令人痛心。党完全是根据原则性的考虑主动采取这一步骤的。党认为，反对崇拜斯大林的行动如果引起某些暂时的困难，那么，从工人阶级的根本利益和最终目标来看，将来会有巨大的良好的结果。因为这样做就能可靠地保证今后在我们党和国家内绝不会产生类似个人崇拜的现象，保证今后在实行马克思列宁主义政策的基础上，在开展党内民主的条件下，在千百万劳动者的积极参加下，在大力发展苏维埃民主的情况下，对党和国家实行集体领导。
    党坚决反对个人崇拜及其后果，公开批评个人崇拜所产生的错误，这样就再次表明自己忠于马克思列宁主义的不朽原则，忠于人民的利益，关心创造最有利的条件来发展党内民主和苏维埃民主，以利于在我国顺利建设共产主义。
    苏共中央确认，在各级党组织中和劳动人民的大会上讨论个人崇拜及其后果的问题时，党员和非党员都积极地参加了，苏共中央的路线在党和人民当中得到了完全的赞同和支持。
    党所公布的破坏社会主义法制的事实以及与对斯大林的个人崇拜有关的其他错误，当然令人痛心和深感遗憾。但是苏联人了解，为了他们所积极参加的共产主义建设的利益，谴责个人崇拜是必需的。苏联人民看到，党在近几年中坚定地采取了实际措施来消除个人崇拜在党、国家、经济和文化建设各方面所引起的后果。由于这一工作，党内力量现在再不受什么东西束缚了，党更加靠近了人民，党内的创造性积极性空前提高了。
    （二）
    在苏维埃社会主义制度条件下，对斯大林的个人崇拜居然发生并且得到了流行，造成了各种不良后果，这种情况如何能够产生呢？
    在考察这一问题的时候，应该既考虑到苏联的社会主义建设所处的具体的客观历史条件，也考虑到同斯大林的个人品质有关的某些主观因素。
    十月社会主义革命，是作为在工人阶级的领导下完成对资本主义社会的革命改造的典范而载入史册的。其他国家的共产党、一切进步和民主势力都以布尔什维克党的英勇斗争、以世界上第一个社会主义国家——苏联为范例，来学习解决现代社会发展所提出的根本社会问题的经验。在将近四十年的社会主义社会建设中，我国劳动人民积累了大量的经验，其他社会主义国家的劳动人民都在研究这些经验，并且结合本国的具体条件创造性地加以运用。
    这是历史上建成社会主义社会的第一个经验。这个社会是在探求和用实践检验许多真理的过程中形成的，在这以前，社会主义者只在理论上知道这些真理的一个大概轮廓。在二十五年多的时期内，苏维埃国家是为人类开辟走向社会主义道路的唯一的国家。它像一个在资本主义包围中被围困的堡垒。苏维埃国家的西方和东方的敌人，在1918到1920年十四国武装干涉失败之后，继续准备向苏联进行新的“十字军讨伐”。敌人向苏联派遣大批间谍和破坏分子，千方百计地力图破坏世界上第一个社会主义国家。法西斯主义于1933年在德国掌握了政权，宣布自己的目标是要消灭共产主义、消灭苏联——世界上第一个劳动人民的国家，在这以后，帝国主义对苏联发动新侵略的威胁特别加强了。得到整个国际反动势力的积极支持的所谓“反共产国际公约”，“柏林—罗马—东京轴心”的形成，是大家都记得的。在新战争威胁迫近、西方国家拒绝苏联不止一次建议的关于制止法西斯主义和组织集体安全的措施的情况下，苏维埃国家不得不竭尽全力来加强国防，同敌对的资本主义包围的阴谋进行斗争。党必须教育全体人民始终一贯地保持警惕性，并且动员起来，准备对付外部敌人。
    当时，由于在国内长期地进行着残酷的阶级斗争和解决着“谁战胜谁”的问题，国际反动势力的阴谋就更具有危险性。列宁逝世以后，敌对派别托洛茨基分子、右倾机会主义者、资产阶级民族主义者在党内活跃起来了，他们采取了抛弃列宁提出的关于社会主义能够在一国取得胜利的理论的立场，这样实际上会导致资本主义在苏联的复辟。党对列宁主义的这些敌人展开了无情的斗争。
    共产党遵守列宁的遗训，采取了国家社会主义工业化、农业集体化和实现文化革命的方针。苏联人民和共产党在解决这些在单独一个国家内建设社会主义社会的极其巨大的任务的道路上，需要克服许多难以想像的困难和阻碍。我国要在极短的历史时期内，在没有任何外来经济援助的情况下，消灭历来的落后状态，按新的社会主义的原则改造整个国民经济。
    在这种复杂的国际国内环境里，需要有铁的纪律，需要不懈地提高警惕性，需要有极其严格的集中领导，这不能不对一些民主形式的发展起不好的影响。在同整个帝国主义世界进行残酷斗争的过程中，我国不得不对民主作一些限制，从我国人民在帝国主义包围形势下为社会主义奋斗的逻辑上来说，这是正确的。但是，这些限制还在当时就已经被党和人民看成是暂时的，是应当随着苏维埃国家的巩固以及全世界民主和社会主义力量的发展而予以取消的。人民看到苏维埃社会制度一天天取得新的成就，自觉地承受了这种暂时的牺牲。
    在共产党及其贯彻列宁的总路线的中央委员会的领导下，苏联人民克服了建设社会主义道路上的这一切困难。
    我国在敌人包围和不断有外来侵略的威胁的情况下取得社会主义胜利，这是有世界历史意义的功绩，这一功绩是苏联人民作出的。由于人民和党的紧张的劳动和英勇的努力，一个经济落后的国家在最初几个五年计划中，在它的经济和文化发展上有了巨大的飞跃。在社会主义建设的成就的基础上，劳动人民的生活水平提高了，失业现象永远消除了。国内发生了极深刻的文化革命。在短短的时期内，从苏联人民当中成长起许许多多的技术干部；他们达到了世界技术发展的水平，使苏联的科学和技术居于世界的前列。伟大的共产党是这些胜利的鼓舞者和组织者。全世界的劳动人民通过苏联的例子，看到工人和农民在取得政权之后，可以不要资本家和地主而胜利地建设和发展自己的、反映和保护广大人民群众利益的社会主义国家。这一切对扩大世界各国共产党和工人党的影响起着极大的鼓舞作用。
    约·维·斯大林在长时期担任党中央委员会总书记，他同其他领导者们一起，为实现列宁遗训而积极斗争。他忠于马克思列宁主义，作为一个理论家和大组织家，他领导了党反对托洛茨基分子、右倾机会主义者、资产阶级民族主义者的斗争，以及反对资本主义包围的阴谋的斗争。在这个政治和思想斗争中，斯大林获得了巨大的威信和声望。但是，我们一切的伟大胜利从此被不正确地都同他的名字联系起来。共产党和苏维埃国家所取得的成绩，以及对斯大林的颂扬，使他冲昏了头脑。在这样的情况下，开始逐渐形成对斯大林的个人崇拜。
    约·维·斯大林的一些个人品质在很大程度上助长了个人崇拜的发展，弗·伊·列宁就曾经指出过斯大林的不好的性格。1922年年底，列宁在他给那届党代表大会的信中说：
    “斯大林同志当总书记后，在他的手中集中了极大的权力，我还不能肯定，他是否能够经常充分审慎地利用这个权力。”1923年1月初，列宁在这封信的补充意见中又提到对领导者来说所不能令人容忍的斯大林的某些个人品质。列宁写道：“斯大林过于粗暴，这个缺点在我们共产党人之间和我们彼此的交往中是完全可以容忍的，但是身为总书记，这种缺点就不能令人容忍了。因此，我建议同志们考虑一下撤消斯大林总书记职务的方法，任命另外一个人，只要他在下列几方面比斯大林强就行：更耐心，更忠顺，更温和，更关心同志，少任性等等。”
    在列宁逝世后不久召开的党的第十三次代表大会上，列宁的这些信件在代表团中间宣读过。对这些文件讨论的结果，大家认为最好让斯大林继续任总书记，但是要他考虑列宁的批评，并且从中得出一切必要的结论。
    斯大林留任中央委员会总书记后，在列宁逝世后的初期还重视列宁的批评意见。但是后来，斯大林太过分地高估了自己的功绩，相信自己不会犯错误。在和阶级敌人及其走狗进行严酷斗争的条件下，在后来反抗德国法西斯强盗的战争的条件下，党内民主和苏维埃民主受到某些限制是不可避免的，可是斯大林开始把这些限制变成党内生活和国家生活的准则，粗暴地践踏了列宁的领导原则。党的中央全体会议和代表大会不定期召开，以后甚至多年内完全不召开。斯大林实际上置身于批评之外。
    斯大林关于苏联愈向社会主义前进，阶级斗争就愈尖锐的错误公式，给社会主义建设事业，给党内和国家内的民主的开展造成了很大的危害。这个公式只是在过渡时期的一定阶段，当解决“谁战胜谁”的问题的时候，当进行着争取建成社会主义基础的顽强的阶级斗争的时候才是正确的；然而在1937年，当社会主义已经在我国取得胜利，当剥削阶级及其经济基础已经被消灭的时候，这个公式竟被提到首位。在实践中，这个错误的理论公式，成了粗暴地破坏社会主义法制和大规模进行镇压的论据。
    正是在那样的情况下，形成了例如国家保安机关的特殊地位，这些机关受到极大的信任，因为它们在保卫革命的成果方面对人民和国家有了无容置疑的功绩。在很长的时期内，国家保安机关没有辜负这种信任，它们的特殊地位也没有引起什么危险。然而，当党和政府对这些机关的监督逐渐为斯大林的个人监督所代替，通常的司法准则常常被他个人的决定所代替之后，事情就发生了变化。在国际帝国主义的代理人贝利亚的罪恶匪帮窃取了国家保安机关的领导地位之后，情况就更加复杂了。苏维埃法制遭到了严重的破坏，发生了大规模的镇压。由于敌人的阴谋活动，许多正直的共产党员和非党的苏联人遭到诬告，无辜受难。
    党的第二十次代表大会和中央委员会在斯大林逝世后执行的整个政策清楚地证明，在党中央委员会内有着已经形成的列宁主义的领导核心，这个领导核心正确地了解了内政方面和外交方面已经成熟的要求。不能说，没有反对过那些与个人崇拜有关的、阻碍社会主义向前发展的不良现象。而且在某些时期，譬如说，在战争时期，斯大林的独断独行曾经受到大大的限制，违法和专横等等不良现象曾经大大地减弱。
    大家知道，中央委员会的委员以及杰出的苏联将领正是在战争时期曾把后方和前方的某些部分的工作掌握到自己手里，独立地作出决定，并以自己在组织、政治、经济和军事方面的工作，同地方党组织和苏维埃机关一起保证了苏联人民在战争中的胜利。胜利以后，个人崇拜的不良影响又变得厉害起来了。
    中央委员会的列宁主义核心在斯大林逝世后就立即着手同个人崇拜及其严重后果作坚决的斗争。
    也许要问：为什么这些人不公开地反对斯大林，不解除他的领导职务呢？在当时已经形成的情况下，这样做是不可能的。当然，事实说明，斯大林对许多违法现象，尤其是在他生平的后期中所发生的违法现象，是负有责任的。但同时也不能忘记，斯大林在苏联人的心目中是一个始终保护苏联、反对敌人的阴谋、始终为社会主义事业奋斗的人。他在这一斗争中有时采用了不适当的方法，破坏了列宁主义原则和党内生活准则。斯大林的悲剧就在这里。然而，这一切也使反对当时发生的违法现象的斗争感到困难，因为，建设社会主义和巩固苏联的成就在个人崇拜的影响下都被归功于斯大林。
    在这种情况下，对他的任何反对都会为人民所不理解，这里问题完全不在于个人勇气不够。显然，谁要是在这种情况下反对斯大林，他就不会得到人民的支持。而且，在那种情况下，这样的行动会被认为是反对社会主义建设事业的行动，被认为是在资本主义包围的环境下破坏党和整个国家团结的极其危险的行动。同时，苏联劳动人民在自己的共产党领导下所取得的成就，使每一个苏联人的心里产生合情合理的自豪感，并且造成这样一种气氛：在巨大的成就的衬托下，个别错误和缺点看起来是次要的；而实际上，这些错误所造成的不良后果，很快地就被党和苏维埃社会的迅速成长起来的有生力量盖过了。
    还应当注意到：许多事实和斯大林的不正确的行为，特别是破坏苏维埃法制的行为，只是在最近时期，在斯大林逝世后，主要是在揭露了贝利亚匪帮和建立起党对国家保安机关的监督以后才发觉的。
    对斯大林的个人崇拜得以产生和流行的主要条件和原因就是这样。当然，上面所说的一切，只是对于对斯大林的个人崇拜及其后果的说明，而决不是为它们作辩护，这种个人崇拜及其后果已经受到我们党的尖锐的公正的谴责。
    （三）
    毫无疑问，个人崇拜给共产党的事业和苏维埃社会造成了严重的损失。但是，如果从过去存在个人崇拜的事实中作出苏联的社会制度有了什么改变的结论，或是从苏维埃社会制度的本质中寻找这种崇拜的根源，那就是严重的错误。这两种想法都是绝对不正确的。因为这是不符合事实的，是违反事实的。
    尽管对斯大林的个人崇拜给党和人民造成了很大的祸害，但是它不能改变而且也没有改变我们的社会制度的本质。任何个人崇拜都不能改变社会主义国家的本质，因为社会主义国家的基础是生产资料的公有制、工农联盟和各民族的友谊，虽然这种崇拜对社会主义民主的开展，对千百万人的创造性主动性的发挥造成了严重的损失。
    认为个别人物，包括像斯大林这样的大人物在内，能够改变我国的社会政治制度，那就是陷入完全违反事实、违反马克思主义、违反真理的境地，陷入唯心主义的境地。那就是认为个别人物有非凡的、超人的力量，能够改变社会制度，甚至能够改变千百万劳动群众起决定作用的社会制度。
    大家知道，决定社会政治制度的本质的是：具有什么样的生产方式，生产资料属于社会中的什么人，以及政权掌握在什么阶级的手里。全世界都知道，在我国，由于十月革命和社会主义的胜利，确立了社会主义的生产方式，政权掌握在工人阶级和农民手里差不多已经有四十年。因此，苏维埃社会制度一年比一年巩固，它的生产力不断发展。这个事实，甚至连对我们心怀恶意的人也是不能不承认的。
    大家知道，由于个人崇拜的后果，在领导党和苏维埃国家的各种工作部门方面，在苏维埃国家的内政和外交政策方面，都有一些严重的错误。例如，可以指出，斯大林在领导农业上、在组织国家反击法西斯侵略者的准备工作上犯了严重错误，他的粗暴专横行为造成了在战后时期同南斯拉夫的冲突。这些错误妨碍了苏维埃国家生活的个别方面的发展，特别是在斯大林的晚年妨碍了苏维埃社会的发展，但是，不用说，这些错误并没有使苏维埃社会离开向共产主义发展的正确道路。
    我们的敌人硬说，对斯大林的个人崇拜之所以产生，不是由于已经成为过去的一定历史条件，而是由于苏维埃制度本身，是由于（在他们看来）这一制度的不民主，等等。苏维埃国家发展的全部历史驳斥了这种诽谤。苏维埃即国家政权的新的民主形式，是在为自由而奋斗的广大人民群众的革命创造的基础上产生的。苏维埃曾经是并且现在仍然是真正的人民政权机关。正是苏维埃制度使得人民能够发挥巨大的创造力。苏维埃制度发动了人民群众的无穷无尽的力量，吸引千千万万的人来自觉地管理国家和积极地创造性地参加社会主义建设。在短短的历史时期内，苏维埃国家经受住了最艰苦的考验，经历了第二次世界大战炮火中的考验。
    当我们国家内消灭了最后的剥削阶级的时候，当社会主义在整个国民经济中成为统治的制度的时候，当我国的国际地位有了根本的改变的时候，苏维埃民主的范围不可估量地扩大了，而且还在继续扩大。苏维埃民主和任何资产阶级民主不同，它不仅宣布，而且从物质上保证全体社会成员有工作、受教育、休息、参加国家事务的权利，有言论、出版、信仰的自由，有自由发展个人才能的实际机会，能享受一切其他的民主权利和自由。民主的实质不在于形式上的标志，而在于政权是否为大多数人民群众的意志和根本利益、为劳动人民的利益服务，是否在实际上反映他们的意志和利益。苏维埃国家的整个对内和对外政策说明，我们的制度是真正民主的、真正人民的制度。苏维埃国家的最高目标和经常关怀的事情，是全力提高居民的生活水平，保障本国人民的和平生活。
    党和政府所采取的扩大加盟共和国的职权，严格遵守法制，改变计划制度以发挥地方积极性，加强地方苏维埃的活动，开展批评和自我批评等方面的措施，都是苏维埃民主进一步发展的证明。
    尽管存在着个人崇拜，但是在共产党领导下的人民群众中由于我国制度而产生的旺盛的主动精神，克服了社会主义建设道路上的一切障碍，创造了自己的具有历史意义的伟大事业。这就是苏维埃社会主义制度的民主的最高表现。社会主义在我国的辉煌胜利并不是自行到来的。这种胜利的取得，是由于党和它的地方组织进行了巨大的组织工作和教育工作，是由于党经常以忠于马克思列宁主义的精神，忠于共产主义事业的精神教育自己的干部和全体共产党员。苏维埃社会的力量就在于群众的觉悟。它的历史命运在过去和现在都是由我们英勇的工人阶级，光荣的集体农庄庄员和人民的知识分子的创造性劳动来决定的。
    我们的党由于消灭个人崇拜的后果，恢复党的生活的布尔什维克的准则，发扬社会主义民主，从而进一步加强了同广大群众的联系，把他们更加紧密地团结在伟大的列宁的旗帜下。
    党勇敢地公开地自动提出了关于消除个人崇拜、关于斯大林所犯的不可容忍的错误的问题，这一事实令人信服地证明：党是在坚决保护列宁主义，维护社会主义和共产主义的事业，维护社会主义法制和人民的利益，保障苏联公民的权利。这是苏维埃社会主义制度的力量和生命力的最好的明证。这同时也说明了对彻底消除个人崇拜的后果和今后不再犯类似错误的决心。
    我们党对于对斯大林的个人崇拜及其后果的指责，得到了各兄弟共产党和工人党的赞同和广泛的反应。各国共产党人都指出苏共第二十次代表大会对整个国际共产主义运动和工人运动有着巨大的意义，都把反对个人崇拜及其后果的斗争看作是为维护马克思列宁主义原则的纯洁性、为创造性地解决国际工人运动中的当前问题、为确立和进一步发展无产阶级国际主义原则而进行的斗争。
    许多兄弟共产党的声明都拥护和支持我们党所采取的反对个人崇拜及其后果的措施。中国共产党中央委员会机关报“人民日报”阐述了中国共产党中央委员会政治局会议从讨论苏共第二十次代表大会决议中所得出的结论，在“关于无产阶级专政的历史经验”这篇编辑部文章中写道：“苏联共产党遵循列宁的遗教，现在正在认真地对待斯大林在领导社会主义建设中所犯的某些性质严重的错误及其所遗留的后果。由于其后果的严重性，所以苏联共产党有必要在肯定斯大林的伟大功绩的同时，又尖锐地揭露斯大林所犯的错误的实质，号召全党以此为戒，坚决地消除这种错误所造成的不良后果。我们中国共产党人深信，经过苏联共产党二十次代表大会这一次尖锐的批判之后，过去被某些错误政策所严重地压抑了的一切积极因素，必将普遍地活跃起来，苏联共产党和苏联人民将比较过去更好地团结一致，为了建设一个人类从来没有看见过的伟大的共产主义社会和争取全世界的持久和平而奋斗。”
    法国共产党政治局声明说：“苏联共产党领导人的功绩，在于他们采取措施来纠正同个人崇拜有关的错误和缺点，这证明列宁的伟大的党的力量和团结，证明它在苏联人民中所享有的信任，也证明它在国际工人运动中的威信。”美国共产党全国委员会总书记尤金·丹尼斯同志在一篇大家知道的文章中指出了苏共第二十次代表大会的巨大意义，他说：“第二十次代表大会加强了世界和平和社会进步。它标志着社会主义发展和为和平共处而斗争的新阶段。为和平共处的斗争是从列宁在世的时候起就开始的，这一斗争以后一直在继续着，并且越来越有作用和成效。”
    同时也应该指出，在讨论个人崇拜问题的时候，对产生个人崇拜的原因和对这种崇拜给我国社会制度造成的后果所作的解释，并非都是正确的。例如，陶里亚蒂同志在对“新议论”杂志的问题所作的一篇详尽的、引人注意的答复中，除作出了许多极重要的、正确的结论之外，同时还含有不正确的论点。例如，不能同意陶里亚蒂同志关于这样一个问题的提法：苏维埃社会是否已经走向“某种蜕化形式”呢？提出这一问题是没有什么根据的。这个问题的提出尤其令人莫解的是，陶里亚蒂同志在自己的答复的另一处十分正确地说：“必须作出结论，社会主义制度的本质并没有丧失，因为以前的任何一个成果，首先是组成苏维埃社会的工人、农民、知识分子群众对这一制度的支持，都没有丧失。这种支持本身就证明，无论如何，这个社会保持了它的基本民主性质。”
    真的，要是没有广大人民群众支持苏维埃政权，支持共产党的政策，我们的国家就不可能在空前短的时期内建立起强大的社会主义工业，实现农业集体化，它就不可能在决定全人类命运的第二次世界大战中取得胜利。由于彻底粉碎了希特勒主义、意大利法西斯主义和日本军国主义，共产主义运动的力量得到了广泛的发展，意大利、法国和其他资本主义国家的共产党壮大了，并且成了群众性的政党，在欧洲和亚洲的一些国家里建立起了人民民主制度，世界社会主义体系产生并得到了巩固，使帝国主义殖民体系走向崩溃的民族解放运动取得了空前的胜利。
    （四）
    共产党员和全体苏联人民一致拥护苏联共产党第二十次代表大会指责个人崇拜的决议，认为这些决议是我们党的力量增长的证明，是党的列宁主义原则性、党的统一和团结的证明。列宁说：“革命无产阶级的政党强大得能够公开进行自我批评，毫不含糊地把自己的错误和弱点叫做错误和弱点”。（列宁全集第二十一卷第一五○页）我们党遵循着列宁的这个原则，今后仍将勇敢揭发、公开批评和坚决消除自己工作中的错误和过失。
    苏共中央认为，到现在为止党所进行的消除个人崇拜及其后果的工作已经有了良好的结果。
    苏共中央委员会根据第二十次代表大会的决议向所有党组织发出下列号召：
    在我们全部工作中始终如一地遵循马克思列宁主义学说中关于人民是历史的创造者、是人类一切物质财富和精神财富的创造者，关于马克思主义政党在改造社会、争取共产主义胜利的革命斗争中的决定性作用这样一些最重要的原理；
    不屈不挠地继续贯彻党中央委员会近几年来进行的工作，即各级党组织自上而下地严格遵守列宁主义的党的领导原则，首先是集体领导这个最高原则，遵守我们党章所规定的党的生活的准则，开展批评和自我批评；
    完全恢复苏联宪法中所体现的苏维埃社会主义民主的原则，彻底消除破坏革命的社会主义法制的现象；
    动员我们的干部、全体共产党员和最广大的劳动人民群众为实现第六个五年计划的任务而奋斗，为此尽力发挥群众——历史的真正创造者的创造性主动性和力量。
    苏共第二十次代表大会指出，我们这个时代的一个极重要的特点是，社会主义变成了世界体系。发展和确立社会主义的最困难的时期已经过去了。我们的社会主义国家不再是资本主义国家汪洋大海中的孤岛了。现在，全人类三分之一以上的人口在社会主义的旗帜下建设着新生活。社会主义思想正在掌握资本主义国家中千千万万人。社会主义思想对于正在反对各种殖民主义的亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲的人民的影响是巨大的。
    苏共第二十次代表大会的决议，被一切拥护和平和社会主义的人、一切民主和进步人士看成是鼓舞人们为巩固世界和平、为工人阶级的利益、为社会主义事业的胜利而斗争的纲领。
    在目前的条件下，在各国共产党和整个国际工人运动面前开辟了广阔的令人鼓舞的前景——同一切和平力量一道努力防止新的世界大战，约制垄断资本，保障持久和平和各国人民的安全，停止扩充军备，使劳动人民摆脱因扩充军备而带来的沉重的税收负担，捍卫保障劳动人民为自己的美好生活和光辉未来而奋斗的民主权利和自由。这正是世界各国千百万普通人切身关心的事情。苏联、中华人民共和国以及其他走上社会主义道路的国家的和平政策和日新月异的成就，在极大程度上促进这些问题的顺利解决。
    在新的历史情况下，共产国际和共产党情报局这样的工人阶级国际组织停止了自己的工作。但是，这决不是说，站在马克思列宁主义立场上的革命的兄弟政党的国际团结和接触的必要性已经失去意义。现在，当社会主义力量和社会主义思想在全世界的影响有了无限增长的时候，当不同国家沿着不同道路走向社会主义的时候，工人阶级的马克思主义政党当然应该在反对新战争威胁的斗争中，在反对那些力图镇压所有革命运动和进步运动的垄断资本的反人民势力的斗争中，保持并加强自己的思想统一和国际主义的兄弟团结。把各国共产党团结在一起的，是把工人阶级从资本的压迫下解放出来这一伟大目标；把各国共产党结成一体的，是对科学的马克思列宁主义的思想和无产阶级国际主义精神的忠诚，对于人民群众利益的绝对忠诚。
    在现时情况下，各国共产党的工作都从每一个国家的民族特点和条件出发，最充分地反映自己人民的民族利益。而且，它们意识到为工人阶级利益、为和平和自己国家的民族独立而进行的斗争，同时就是整个国际无产阶级的事业，因此它们团结起来，加强彼此之间的联系和合作。现在，各国工人阶级的马克思主义政党的思想团结和兄弟般的团结尤其是必要的，因为垄断资本正在建立诸如北大西洋公约组织、东南亚条约组织和巴格达条约这样一些国际侵略性的联盟和集团，来反对爱好和平的各国人民，反对民族解放运动，反对工人阶级以及劳动人民的切身利益。
    苏联过去和现在为缓和国际紧张局势做了许多工作，现在大家也都承认这一点，但是，美国垄断资本却继续拨出大笔款项来加紧在社会主义国家中进行破坏活动。大家知道，当“冷战”正激烈的时候，美国国会正式拨出一亿美元（非正式拨出的经费除外），在人民民主国家和苏联进行破坏活动。现在，当苏联和其他社会主义国家尽一切努力来缓和国际紧张局势的时候，主张“冷战”的人却力图使遭到全世界人民谴责的“冷战”活动加紧起来。美国参议院关于补充拨款二千五百万美元以从事破坏活动的决议，就说明了这一点，这种破坏活动被厚颜无耻地称为对“铁幕”后面的“自由的鼓励”。
    我们应当冷静地估计这个事实，并且从中得出相应的结论。譬如，反人民的波兹南骚动的经费显然就是从这里来的。但是，领取大洋彼岸的经费的挑衅分子和破坏分子只逞了几小时的威风。波兹南劳动人民对敌人的袭击和挑衅作了反击。卑鄙的“斗篷和短剑”骑士的计划失败了，他们对波兰人民政权的可耻的挑衅失败了。今后在各人民民主国家进行的破坏活动还会像这样地遭到失败，不管这种破坏活动从美国垄断资本那里得到多么慷慨拿出的经费。可以说，这些钱是白花的。
    这些都证明，对于力图潜入社会主义国家来危害和破坏劳动人民成就的帝国主义间谍的新阴谋，绝不能疏忽大意。
    帝国主义反动势力力图使劳动人民离开为自己的利益而斗争的正确道路，力图向他们灌输毒素，使他们不相信和平和社会主义事业的胜利。虽然资本主义垄断组织思想家玩弄各种阴谋，以久经考验的共产主义先锋队为领导的工人阶级在沿着自己的道路前进，这条道路已经引导到了社会主义的历史性成就，并且还要引导到和平、民主和社会主义的新胜利。可以相信，各国共产党和工人党将更高地举起光荣的马克思主义的无产阶级国际主义的旗帜。
    苏联人民理所当然地引为自豪的是，我们的祖国第一个铺设了通向社会主义的道路。现在，当社会主义已经成为世界体系，各个社会主义国家之间建立了兄弟合作和互助的时候，发扬社会主义民主，进一步加强共产主义的物质生产基础，不断提高劳动人民的生活水平，全面发展新型的人——共产主义社会建设者的个性，就有了良好的新条件。让资产阶级的思想家去编造共产主义“危机”、共产党队伍“混乱”的神话吧。我们听惯了敌人的这类咒语。他们的预言最后总是化成泡影。这些倒霉的预言者出现了，又消失了，而共产主义运动，不朽的、生气勃勃的马克思列宁主义思想却不断取得胜利。今后也仍将是这样。我们的敌人的任何恶毒的诽谤攻击，都不能终止人类走向共产主义的不可遏制的历史发展进程。
