    Is Such Treatment of Criticism Permissible?
    —Letter from a Party Member—
    To the Editor:
    On May 5th, the first Party Congress of Xinhailian City, Jiangsu Province, was held. At this congress, the delegates raised many criticisms of Comrade Fang Jin, member of the CPC Xinhailian City Committee and Secretary of the General Branch of the Phosphate Mine, and demanded that he make a public self-criticism at the meeting.
    Logically, Comrade Fang Jin, as a member of the CPC City Committee, should have humbly listened to the opinions of Party members and the masses and made a profound self-criticism of his mistakes. However, the opposite was true. Comrade Fang Jin adopted a "light touch" approach to these criticisms from below, attempting to "get away with it" by using individualism to criticize his own individualism! For example, the delegation from the county's directly subordinate organs criticized him for being overly concerned with personal reputation and status, and revealed the following two incidents: One incident occurred last year during the ranking of Xinhailian City's government cadres. At that time, Fang Jin was anxious to know if he had been promoted, so he went to the Organization Department of the City Committee to ask. When the comrades in the Organization Department told him that the ranking materials had been sealed and sent to the mailroom for submission, he actually went to wake up the mail clerk in the evening, unauthorizedly opened the Organization Department's mailbag, and checked to see if he had been promoted. The other incident occurred shortly after he was transferred from Changzhou City to Xinhailian City. Once, when filling out a cadre registration form, Comrade Fang Jin told the comrades in the Organization Department that he was about to become the Deputy Secretary of the CPC Changzhou City Committee before coming to Xinhailian City, and this should be filled in on his registration form. This kind of filling was obviously not in accordance with organizational regulations, and after the comrades in the Organization Department asked Comrade Xu Yaolin, Deputy Secretary of the CPC Xinhailian City Committee, they did not follow his requirements, which caused Fang Jin's dissatisfaction.
    How did Fang Jin criticize these two incidents that fully exposed his serious individualistic thinking? Although he started with the opening remark "This time I want to make a thorough and profound self-criticism at the congress," and the "self-criticism" was very long, apart from the empty phrase "It's my fault," the rest was to defend his mistakes, and some of the defenses were simply unreasonable. Taking his unauthorized opening of the Organization Department's sealed mail as an example, instead of examining this mistake from his own thinking, he said, "The envelope was not sealed with glue, but stapled." The implication seemed to be that he should not be blamed for unauthorized opening of official mail, but rather the Organization Department should be blamed for not sealing the mail with glue. Speaking of wanting to fill in the form that he was about to become the Deputy Secretary of the Changzhou City Committee, he seemed to have no responsibility either. Why? Because he "heard it from the former Secretary of the Changzhou City Committee." As for why he requested that this "unprecedented" "experience" be filled in the cadre registration form, he avoided talking about it.
    Comrade Fang Jin's attitude towards criticism is not accidental. Last year, the Xinhua Daily criticized Fang Jin for nepotism and arbitrarily arranging for his relatives to work in the phosphate mine and power plant. Not only did Fang Jin not examine his shortcomings subjectively, but he also emphasized objective reasons to the responsible comrades of the City Committee and expressed dissatisfaction with the criticism in the Party newspaper; moreover, he has been procrastinating until now without making a self-criticism. The delegates also criticized Fang Jin for this matter at this meeting. Why didn't Fang Jin make a public self-criticism in the Party newspaper in accordance with the "Decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on Carrying Out Criticism and Self-Criticism in Newspapers and Periodicals"? In his self-criticism at this meeting, he said: "Due to my own procrastinating work style, I was unable to make a timely self-criticism in the newspaper. This is my fault." Why so "procrastinating"? What exactly is wrong? Comrade Fang Jin did not say.
    I believe that Comrade Fang Jin should correct his attitude towards criticism and self-criticism; the CPC Xinhailian City Committee should also, in accordance with the requirements of the Party representatives, seriously deal with Comrade Fang Jin's mistakes.

    允许这样对待批评吗？
    ——党员来信——
    编辑同志：
    五月五日，江苏省新海连市召开了第一次党代表大会。在这次大会上，代表们对中共新海连市市委委员兼磷矿总支书记方进同志提出了很多批评，并要求他在会上作公开的检讨。
    照理，作为中共市委委员的方进同志应该虚心听取党员群众的意见，深刻检讨自己的错误。但事实恰恰相反，方进同志对待这些来自下面的批评，采取了“避重就轻”的“过关”态度，以个人主义来检讨自己的个人主义！比如县直属机关代表团对他的斤斤计较个人的名誉、地位提出了批评，并揭发了这样两件事情：一件事发生在去年新海连市机关干部评级的时候。当时，方进急于要知道自己是不是被提了级，就跑到市委组织部去问，当组织部的同志告诉他评级的材料已经封好，并已送到收发室准备上报以后，他竟在晚间去叫收发员开门，擅自把组织部的信包打开，看看自己有没有提级。另一件事发生在他由常州市调来新海连市不久的时候，有一次填干部登记表，方进同志告诉组织部的同志说，他在来新海连市以前快要担任中共常州市委副书记了，登记表里应该给他填上。这种填法显然不合组织规定，组织部的同志在请示中共新海连市市委副书记许耀林同志以后，就没有按照他的要求办结果，又引起了方进的不满。
    对于这两件充分暴露了他的严重的个人主义思想的事情，方进是怎样检讨的呢？虽然一开始他就作了“这次我在大会上要作彻底深刻的检讨”的开场白，而且“检讨”的时间也很长，但对于自己的错误，除了“是我的不对”这样一句空话以外，剩下的就是为自己的错误辩解，有的辩解简直到了无理取闹的程度。拿他私拆组织部已封好上报的信件来说，他没有从自己的思想上检查这一错误，反而说什么：“信封不是胶水封的，是钉起来的。”言外之意，似乎不应该怪他私拆公函，而应该责备组织部不把信件用胶水封起来。说到要在表上填写他快要当常州市委副书记一事，他好像也没有责任。为什么呢？因为他“是听原常州市委书记说的”。至于他为什么要求把这种“史无前例”的“履历”也填到干部登记表上去，却避而不谈。
    方进同志这种对待批评的态度，不是偶然的。去年新华日报批评了方进任人唯亲，随意安插自己的亲属到磷矿和电厂里工作以后，方进不但不从主观上来检查自己的缺点，反而向市委负责同志强调客观原因，对党报的批评表示不满；而且一直拖到现在不作检讨。这次会上代表们为这件事也对方进提出了批评。为什么方进不按照中共中央“关于在报纸刊物上开展批评和自我批评的决定”在党报上作公开的检讨呢？他在这次会上检讨说：“由于我本人作风太拖拉的原因，所以不能及时在报纸上作检讨，这是我的不对。”为什么这样“拖拉”？究竟那里不对？方进同志却没有说。
    我认为方进同志应该端正自己对待批评和自我批评的态度；中共新海连市委也应该根据党代表们的要求，对方进同志的错误进行严肃的处理。　共产党员　戴芳山
