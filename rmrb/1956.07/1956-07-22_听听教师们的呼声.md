Listen to the Teachers' Voices
    Zhong Huai
    Recently, while sorting through letters, I came across a few from my sister. My sister is a primary school teacher in Jiangjin County, Sichuan, and is very busy with work. She is also the mother of four children and has a lot of housework, so she rarely writes, only once or twice during winter and summer vacations. In each letter, my sister always talks about her holiday life. What surprises me is that after re-reading these letters together, I found that the content of her life during each vacation is so similar in terms of being "busy."
        "During the holidays, we went down every day to engage in labor production education and study the Constitution's propaganda work, which did not end until August 21st. But we still have to go down frequently to understand the situation. Plus, there is the work of recruiting new students, so this vacation is quite busy." (September 16, 1954)
          "The vacation has started, but it's not really a vacation, but the beginning of another intense work period—labor production education, which has not stopped for a single day in July and August. It was originally planned that teachers could take turns taking a week off, but for the needs of the work, we have been working all along. I am the leader of a work group, so of course I can't rest, and I haven't asked for a rest." (August 19, 1955)
          "On the surface, we have been on vacation for a long time, but in order to plan the literacy campaign, many comrades have gone to the countryside. I and several teachers who stayed at the school are doing street surveys and statistics, and are responsible for helping the teachers of the spare-time schools that have already started classes to prepare lessons. Life and class time are not much different." (January 28, 1956)
    Look, "vacation is quite busy," "not really a vacation, but the beginning of another intense work period," "life and class time are not much different"—this is the life pattern of a primary school teacher for several vacations. A vacation, as the name suggests, is for people to get rest. But now it has become inextricably linked with "busy" and "intense." It is no wonder that teachers like my sister, who are politically active and responsible in their work, cannot help but reveal dissatisfaction in their words when talking about their holiday life.
    And it's not just the teachers in my sister's province, county, or school who have such experiences! Recently, a primary school teacher in Renhua County, Guangdong, wrote to the China Youth Daily saying that the summer vacation is here again, "But I am very worried. Because in the past, the cadres of our county and district... never let us rest well, whether it was winter or summer vacation, it was either learning, training, or voluntary labor." A primary school teacher in Yiyang County, Hunan, also poured out his feelings to the New Hunan Daily: "With more than ten days to go before the summer vacation, the teachers are worried... Worried about how busy we will be this summer vacation."
    The school's summer vacation has arrived. I hope that all relevant leading organs will listen to the voices of the teachers. May the holiday bring people not "worry" and "sorrow," but physical health, increased knowledge, and a pleasant mood.

    听听教师们的呼声
    钟怀
    最近在清理书信的时候，翻阅了姐姐的几封来信。姐姐是四川江津县的一个小学教员，平日工作很忙，又是四个孩子的母亲，家务也多，因此很少来信，只是逢到寒假、暑假才通一两次信。姐姐每次来信，总要谈谈假期生活的情况。使我奇怪的是，把姐姐这些来信放在一起重读一遍之后，发现她每个假期的生活内容在“忙”这一点上竟是这么相似。
        “我们假期里天天下去搞劳动生产教育和学习宪法
    的宣传工作，直到八月二十一日才结束，但还要经常下去
    了解情况，加上招考新生的工作，因此这个假期相当忙。”
      （1954年9月16日）
          “假期开始了，其实并不是假期，而是另一种紧张
    工作的开始——劳动生产教育，七、八两月没有中止一
    天。原订教师可以轮流休假一个礼拜，可是，为了工作的
    需要，一直在搞。我担任一个工作组长，当然更不能休息
    了，我也没有要求休息。”（1955年8月19日）
          “我们表面上是放假很久了，但是为了规划扫盲工作，
    很多同志下乡去了，我和几个留校的教师搞街上的调查统
    计工作，并负责帮助已开学上课的业余学校的教师们备课，
    生活和上课时并没有多大差别。”（1956年1月28日）
    请看，“假期相当忙”，“并不是假期，而是另一种紧张工作的开始”，“生活和上课时并没有多大差别”——这就是一个小学教师几个假期的生活规律。假期，顾名思义，是要人们得到休息。可是现在它却同“忙”、“紧张”结了不解之缘。这就难怪像姐姐这样政治上积极，工作上也负责的教师，谈到假期生活，字里行间也不免要流露出不满来了。
    又岂止是姐姐所在的那个省、那个县、那个学校的教师，才有这样的遭遇！最近广东仁化县的一个小学教师写信给中国青年报说，今年的暑假又到了，“但是，我却很担心。因为过去我们县、区的干部……无论是寒假、暑假都没让我们好好休息过，不是学习、训练，就是义务劳动。”湖南益阳县一个小学教师也向新湖南报倾吐了自己的心情：“隔暑假还有十多天，教师们就愁起来了……愁的是今年暑假不知又要忙成什么样子。”
    学校的暑假已经到了。但愿一切有关的领导机关，都听听教师们的呼声。但愿假期带给人们的不是“担心”和“愁”，而是身体的健康、知识的增长和心情的愉快。
