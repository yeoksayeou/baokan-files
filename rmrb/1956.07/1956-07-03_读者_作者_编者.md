Readers, Authors, Editors

    Pay Attention to Propaganda and Education Work
    I am an educator, so I am very concerned about the publicity regarding education in the newspapers. The People's Daily does not publish much in this area. For example, problems in the current comprehensive education, problems in classroom teaching, communist education for the younger generation, students' homework and academic burden, all should be reported and discussed. Some problems cannot be solved solely by publications such as People's Education.
    In addition, I suggest adding editor's notes to important essays and communications every day. The note should correctly assess the value of the article and point out what issues should be noted when reading it. This would be beneficial for many readers.
                    (Shèng Déqīng)

    "Unprecedented in Decades" Cannot Explain the Extent of the Bumper Harvest
    Recently, I often see reporters in local newspapers using "unprecedented in more than a decade," or even "unprecedented in decades" to describe this year's wheat harvest. Is it really "unprecedented in decades"? Of course, that is correct. But this does not explain the extent of the bumper harvest. The production level was very low decades ago. 1936 was the highest level before the war, and we have already surpassed it by a lot. In the years after liberation, agricultural productivity in various regions has improved a lot. Although our harvests are not yet very stable every year, they are much better than in old China. I think: the older the harvest, the worse it is, but the more recent the harvest, the better it is. It is not appropriate to use "unprecedented in decades" to mark the current bumper harvest. (Shēn Fēi)

    Is This Sentence Wrong?
    We saw in the "Editor's Note" of the article "Actively and Prudently Admit Intellectuals into the Party" published in the People's Daily on May 29, 1956, said: "... holding a swearing-in ceremony for new party members is not a necessary procedure." We think that the word "not" should be "this" - this is a necessary procedure for joining the Party. Is this correct?
                      (Huá Déshān)

    Editor: The sentence in the "Editor's Note" of this newspaper is not wrong. New Party members do not necessarily have to hold a swearing-in ceremony when joining the Party.

    Needs the following manuscripts:
    1. Comments and discussions on academic and cultural thoughts;

    注意宣传教育工作
    我是一个教育工作者，因此我十分关心报纸上有关教育方面的宣传。在这方面，人民日报登载的不多，例如目前全面教育中的问题，课堂教学中的问题，对青少年一代进行共产主义教育问题，学生的家庭作业和课业负担问题，都应该有所报道和论述，有些问题是不能够单纯由人民教育等报刊去解决的。
    此外，我建议对每天的重要论文、通讯，加上编者按语。按语应正确估计这篇文章的价值，指出在阅读这篇文章时应注意那些问题，这对于许多读者都是有益处的。

    “几十年所未有”不能说明丰收的程度
    近日常在各地报纸上看到记者用“十几年所未有”，甚或是“几十年所未有”来形容今年的小麦丰收。是不是“几十年所未有”呢？当然是对的。但这并不能说明丰收的程度。几十年前的生产水平是很低的。1936年是战前最高的水平，我们已经超过很多了。解放后几年，各地农业生产力都已提高很多，我们每年的收成虽然还不能十分稳定，但比起旧中国，那是好得太多了。我想：收成不是年代越古越好，而是越古越低，用“几十年所未有”来标示现在的丰收，总是不够恰当的。　（申非）
    这句话是不是错了？
    我们看到1956年5月29日人民日报发表的题为“积极慎重的吸收知识分子入党”文中“编者按”说：“……举行新党员入党宣誓仪式，不是必经的手续”。我们认为这个
  “不”字该是“这”字——这是入党必经手续。不知对否？
                      （华德山）
    编者：本报“编者按”语中这句话没有错。新党员入党，不一定要举行宣誓仪式。
