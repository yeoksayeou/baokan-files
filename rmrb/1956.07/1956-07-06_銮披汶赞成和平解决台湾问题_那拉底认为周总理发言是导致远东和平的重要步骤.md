Xinhua News Agency, 5th: Bangkok newspaper reports: Thai Prime Minister Phibunsongkhram said on June 29th that if the Taiwan issue could be resolved peacefully through negotiations, it would make a great contribution to world peace.

According to Thai newspapers, Phibunsongkhram said at a press conference that this was a problem of a Chinese family fighting, and he himself did not want to interfere.

When a reporter asked about Zhou Enlai's expression of China's hope to resume contact with Thailand, which had been interrupted, Phibunsongkhram did not give a direct answer. In his speech, he said that he thought this was a "new attitude" from China.

A reporter asked Phibunsongkhram why Thais were not allowed to visit China. The Prime Minister said, "If I knew it was an infectious disease ward, I would not let my compatriots go there to get infected." He went on to say that the Thai government does not want Thais to visit mainland China for sightseeing yet, but he believes there will be such an opportunity in the future.

Xinhua News Agency, 5th: Bangkok newspaper reports: Thai Foreign Minister Naradhip commented on Premier Zhou Enlai's recent speech to the press on June 30th, saying that the speech was an important step in guiding the situation in the Far East to the path of peace.

Naradhip said that we dare not predict that such direct negotiations, if truly realized, will lead to an agreement. However, if both parties are willing to sit down and negotiate, it will always ease extreme hostility.

Naradhip also mentioned Zhou Enlai's advocacy of first conducting cultural and economic ties with countries that have not yet established diplomatic relations. Naradhip said that the Thai government has never speculated or doubted the sincerity expressed by the Chinese Premier, but Thailand believes that conducting economic or cultural ties first is tantamount to a prelude to recognizing the People's Republic of China. Therefore, the Thai government decided to wait until China enters the United Nations before considering this proposal and resolving the issue of recognizing China.

In his speech, Naradhip listed China's peaceful resolution of the Taiwan issue and its agreement to allow the United Nations to supervise elections in Korea as prerequisites for China's entry into the United Nations.

Regarding the issue of convening the Second Asian-African Conference, the Thai Foreign Minister said that Thailand's support would depend on the agenda. He said that if the agenda only stipulated discussions on issues related to individual countries, such as the dispute between Indonesia and the Netherlands, the conflict between Egypt and Israel, or China's entry into the United Nations, Thailand would not support it. However, if it discusses general issues, such as national self-determination and the maintenance of world peace, Thailand will support it.

    銮披汶赞成和平解决台湾问题
    那拉底认为周总理发言是导致远东和平的重要步骤
    新华社5日讯　曼谷报纸消息：泰国总理銮披汶·颂堪六月二十九日说，台湾问题如果能够通过谈判获得和平解决，那将对世界和平有极大的贡献。
    据泰国报纸报道，銮披汶在记者招待会上说，这是中国一家人打架的问题，他本人不想干预。
    当新闻记者提出了关于周恩来表示中国希望同泰国恢复一度中断的接触的问题的时候，銮披汶没有作正面的答复。他在谈话中表示，他认为这是中国的一种“新姿态”。
    有记者问銮披汶，为什么不准泰国人访问中国。这位总理说：“假如我明知那里是一所传染病房，我是不会让我的同胞到那里去染一身病回来的。”他接着说，泰国政府现在还不想让泰国人到中国大陆去观光，不过，相信将来一定会有这种机会的。
    新华社5日讯　曼谷报纸消息：泰国外交部长那拉底在六月三十日向报界评论周恩来总理最近的发言说，这个发言是把远东局势引导到和平坦途的一个重要的步骤。
    那拉底说，我们不敢预断，说这种直接谈判如果真的实现就会获致协议。但是，假如双方愿意坐下来谈判，总会使得极端仇视的情绪和缓下来。
    那拉底在谈话中也谈到了周恩来主张同尚未建交的国家先进行文化和经济联系的问题。那拉底说，泰国政府对中国总理所表示的诚意，绝未曾作任何推测和怀疑，但是，泰国认为在经济或文化上先进行联系，无形中即等于是承认中华人民共和国的先声，因此，泰国政府决定等待中国进入联合国以后才考虑这个建议和解决承认中国的问题。
    那拉底在谈话中把中国和平解决台湾问题和同意让联合国监督朝鲜的选举等列作中国进入联合国的先决条件。
    这位泰国外交部长在谈到关于召开第二次亚非会议的问题的时候说，泰国是否给予支持，要看议程而定。他说，如果议程中只规定讨论像印度尼西亚同荷兰的纠纷、埃及和以色列的冲突或者是中国进入联合国这样的有关个别国家的问题，泰国将不予支持；但是，如果谈论一般性问题，像民族自决和维护世界和平等问题，泰国就将给予支持。
