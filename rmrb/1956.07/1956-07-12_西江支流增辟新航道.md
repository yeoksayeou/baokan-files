Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: New navigable waterways for ships have been extended nearly 700 kilometers into eight tributaries of the West River upstream, including the Gui River. When a brightly decorated small steamboat sailed for the first time from Rong'an County town in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Prefecture along the Rong River to Laobaokou in Sanjiang Dong Autonomous County, farmers of Zhuang, Dong and other ethnic groups on both banks greeted it with enthusiastic applause, songs, cheers and firecrackers.

The rivers in the upper reaches of the West River are full of dangerous shoals and reefs, and the river channels are narrow and winding. The 443-kilometer-long Gui River has more than 360 dangerous shoals. Due to the difficulty of navigating the river channels, the various goods produced in abundance on both sides of the rivers, such as grain, timber, live pigs, tung oil, rosin, and medicinal materials, could not be transported out in time. Since this spring, the Wuzhou, Liuzhou, and Nanning branches of the Pearl River Navigation Administration have carried out large-scale projects such as blasting reefs, dredging silt, removing cobblestones, building dams, and setting up navigation marks on the eight tributaries of the West River, constantly extending the navigable waterways.

    西江支流增辟新航道
    据新华社讯　通行轮船的新航道，又向西江上游的桂江等八条支流伸展了近七百公里。当一艘装扮得花花绿绿的小轮船，第一次从桂西僮族自治州融安县城沿着融江开向三江侗族自治县的老堡口的时候，两岸的僮、侗等族农民，以热烈的掌声、歌声、欢呼声和爆竹声迎接了它。
    西江上游的各河道，多滩险，多礁，河道狭窄而曲折，443公里长的桂江，就有三百六十多处滩险。由于河道行船困难，江河两岸盛产的粮食、木材、生猪、桐油、松脂、药材等各种物品不能及时运出。今春以来，珠江航运管理局梧州、柳州、南宁等分局在西江的八条支流上，大规模地进行了炸礁、挖泥沙、扒卵石、筑坝、设航标等工程，使航道不断伸延。
