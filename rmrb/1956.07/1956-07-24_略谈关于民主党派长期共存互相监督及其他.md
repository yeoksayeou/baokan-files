A Brief Discussion on the Long-Term Coexistence and Mutual Supervision of Democratic Parties, and Other Matters
Zhou Jianren

China's democratic parties are unique political organizations in China, different from the bourgeois parties, both large and small, other than the proletariat's parties in capitalist countries. Before the liberation of mainland China, all democratic parties supported the call of the Chinese Communist Party. After liberation, they all participated in the government and carried out revolutionary and construction work under the leadership of the Communist Party. Therefore, China's democratic parties are different from the parties in capitalist countries that oppose the Communist Party. On the contrary, they have formed a united front with the Communist Party at its head to carry out work. They are a special type of party that arose in response to China's specific circumstances. Since the Central Committee of the CPC proposed the policy of long-term coexistence and mutual supervision of the democratic parties, some democratic parties have held meetings one after another to discuss this issue. Now I will briefly state my personal thoughts on this matter; and I should add that the opinions expressed here are entirely my own.

As I have already said, China's democratic parties are a product of China's specific historical circumstances; they are not opposed to the Communist Party, but rather a constituent part of the united front led by the Communist Party; its mission is not yet complete, and it should continue to exist to complete it. I remember deeply what Chairman Mao said in "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship": "We are the opposite of the bourgeois parties. They are afraid to talk about the elimination of classes, the elimination of state power, and the elimination of the party. We, on the other hand, openly declare that we are creating the conditions and striving to bring about the elimination of these things." We democratic parties should also think and act in this way, striving to participate in the construction of socialism, striving to complete the things left over from the past or newly arising that should be done, until there is no need to do them anymore. In earlier times, people who did not die young were said to have lived out their "natural lifespan," meaning that they lived to the age they should have lived, and this was considered longevity. The same is true of democratic parties: they exist until the time they need to exist is over, and this is also long-term existence.

There has been much discussion about the issue of mutual supervision, so I will only briefly describe it here. To understand the meaning of supervision, we must first understand the nature of the current government; the politics led by the working-class party is to change ownership and establish a socialist society; that is, to serve the people. Because the benefits gained from increasing production and improving culture belong to all the people, not just a few. Therefore, its relationship with the people is completely different from the relationship between the ruling class and the people in the old society. Officials in the old society were most afraid of supervision by the people, because their politics were inherently unreasonable, and their implementation was of course not reasonable. If they were exposed by the people, they would not be able to continue, so they adopted methods of concealment and deception. The people's democratic dictatorship is doing things for the people, and is only afraid that there will be shortcomings or deviations in implementation, so that the work is not done well, and therefore it is extremely willing for the people to point out or expose these things, so that they can be corrected and the work can be done better. The leaders and the people are integrated into one. We know that the national leading organs generally attach great importance to letters from the people. What do the people's letters say? Some say that cadres have deviations in the implementation of policies, or that personnel arrangements are inappropriate, or that funds are overstocked, or that there are extravagant and wasteful phenomena in handling affairs, and so on. Isn't this supervision? I think this is supervision. The governments at all levels of the new China are doing things under the supervision of the people of the whole country.

Some people have people's organizations or party affiliations, but not all people are organized. An unorganized individual who makes a suggestion once has fulfilled a supervisory role once, and that is the end of his matter; while a democratic party is both organized and participates in the government, so it is more convenient to exercise this right and obligation, to reflect various situations to the leading party and government, to point out shortcomings in implementation, and to make suggestions. There is no doubt that its supervisory role can naturally be done better than that of scattered individuals, but this supervision is still part of the people's supervision, but it is more internal in nature. People's supervision is originally a matter within the people; the term "more internal" here refers to the internal affairs of the united front, and not every member of the people is necessarily a member of the united front. Therefore, the supervision of democratic parties is more internal and can be done better. Moreover, supervision is mutual and has a mutually promoting effect.

Any government that seeks the interests of the people can do a better job with more supervision. Because if there are deviations, shortcomings, or errors, they must be pointed out to be corrected. If they are hidden and not noticed, the deviations will only expand and will not disappear on their own, unless the implementers discover them themselves, and at this time their policy and theoretical level have been improved, so that they can consciously correct them. This situation also exists, but one dare not hope that it can be done universally. Therefore, democratic parties must do this internal work well.

Democratic parties have another task to do. The development of Chinese culture is extremely unbalanced, and is generally very backward. Only because modern international relations are extremely close, unlike the isolation of the past, it is easy to understand that even in a backward country, people on the progressive side can progress to the international level or above. But on the most backward side, as Minister Luo Ruiqing said in his speech some time ago, in a certain period, twenty-seven "emperors" were found in China. Not only did they regard themselves as emperors, but also the backward masses of secret societies actually recognized them! It was really too backward. However, these are matters for the public security departments to handle, not the objects of unity and education for democratic parties. But there is another part of the people in society who may have some progressive demands, but are progressing slowly or very slowly, and democratic parties should allocate part of their strength to contact them. Although their political development is slow, if they are contacted and helped, because socialist construction is advancing, they have a great possibility of accelerating their progress. After a period of time, once their thinking is improved and progressed, it is possible to transform negative forces into positive forces, which is clearly of great benefit to socialist construction. The responsible comrades of the China Association for Promoting Democracy already believe that this is an important task.

There is also the question of how to improve and develop thought. It would be more appropriate to call developing thought "liberating thought." In the old society, thought was greatly restricted and oppressed. The rule of the exploiters was extremely hostile to the people's thought and its development, and it was unfavorable to the exploiting rulers if the people thought more. Although Chinese history does not have the burning and mistreatment of scientific inventors by the power of the Western Church, there have been facts of suppressing thought and opposing knowledge. Not to mention anything else, just citing Confucius's words, "The people can be made to follow it, but not to know it," which has ruled the Chinese ideological circles for a long time, can give one a general idea.

The new China's production and construction are progressing rapidly, and the people's material living standards are constantly improving. But the people are by no means satisfied with just having enough food and clothing. Eating well and dressing well, but lacking thought and growing into a "brain-filled and fat-gutted" big merchant is really not what the people want. The people demand rich thoughts, feelings, rationality, and high wisdom. The Party Central Committee has always paid great attention to this point. "Letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend," marching towards science, and promoting materialism are all related to liberating thought and developing thinking power. Only the continuous development and continuous improvement of thought can lead to a higher level of humanity.

In this regard, I think democratic parties also have work to do. The branch associations of the China Association for Promoting Democracy in other provinces have done some work in this regard in response to the demands of members and the masses they contacted: such as holding forums or lectures, explaining some theoretical and business issues. The Shenyang branch of the China Association for Promoting Democracy has raised the march towards science to an important position in its work. Chinese people are willing to have a high culture, but they must go through deep study and research to achieve something. Only then can they appear in the world as a highly cultured nation; in socialist construction, developing thought is as important as developing industry. It is an important task of socialism for members of democratic parties and the masses they contact to study and delve into knowledge together. This not only adds the nature of a learning group to the democratic parties, but also strengthens the political nature of the democratic parties.

In short, the China Association for Promoting Democracy, as one of the democratic parties, originally aspired to contribute all possible strength to socialist construction. The above is just a brief presentation of a few points. In addition, everything that is beneficial to building socialism should of course be participated in and done, without any doubt. I believe that the members of the China Association for Promoting Democracy, together with the masses they contact, are willing to dedicate their strength to these tasks.

    略谈关于民主党派长期共存互相监督及其他
    周建人
    中国的民主党派是中国特有的政治团体，与资本主义国家的无产阶级政党以外的大小资产阶级的政党是不相同的。在中国大陆解放以前，各民主党派都拥护中国共产党的号召，解放以后都参加了政权，在共产党领导下进行了革命工作和建设工作。因此中国的民主党派与资本主义国家中与共产党对立的政党不同，恰恰相反，它们却以共产党为首结成了统一战线进行工作。它们是应中国的特殊情况而产生的一种特殊党派，自中共中央提出民主党派长期共存，互相监督的方针以后，有些民主党派已先后开会讨论了这一问题。现在我就个人所想到的意见略述于下；并且应当再说一句，这里所说意见完完全全是我个人的。
    前面已经说过，中国民主党派系应中国的特殊历史情况产生的；它们不是与共产党对立，而是共产党领导的统一战线的一个构成部分；它的任务既还没有完了，应继续存在来完成它。我深刻地记得毛主席在
  “论人民民主专政”上曾经说过：“我们和资产阶级政党相反。他们怕说阶级消灭，国家权力的消灭和党的消灭。我们则公开声明，恰是为着促使这些东西的消灭而创设条件，而努力奋斗。”我们民主党派也应当这样想这样做，努力参加建设社会主义，努力做完以前遗留下来或新发生的应做的事情，直到不需要再做而止。早一些时候，叫不在青年夭折的人为尽了“天年”，就是说活到了应该活到的年代，这也就算作长寿。民主党派也是这样，存在到需要存在的时候完结为止，这也就是长存。
    关于互相监督的问题，讨论得已经很多，这里只要略略叙述几句。我们要明了监督的意思，必须首先了解现在政权的性质；工人阶级政党领导的政治是要改变所有制，建立社会主义社会；也就是为人民服务。因为增加生产，提高文化，所获得的利益是全人民的，不是少数人享有的。因此它和人民的关系与旧社会统治阶级与人民的关系就完全不同。旧社会的官吏最怕人民监督，因为它的政治本身就是不合理的，执行上也当然不会合理。如被人民揭发，他们就将搞不下去，所以就采取隐瞒蒙蔽的办法。人民民主专政是在替人民做事，唯恐执行上有缺点或偏差，以致工作做得不好，因此极愿人民指出即揭发出来，以便纠正，使工作做得更好。领导者与人民是结合成一体的。我们知道：全国领导机关一般都很看重人民来信。人民来信中说的是什么呢？有的是说干部执行政策有偏差，或人员安排不适当，或资金有积压，或办事有铺张浪费现象等等。这些不就是监督吗？我想这就是监督。新中国的各级政府是在全国人民的监督之下办事的。
    有的人民有人民团体或党派关系，但不是所有人民都是有组织的。没有组织的个人，提了一次意见，尽了一次监督作用，他的这一次事情就完了；而民主党派却是既有组织，又参加了政权，因此施行这种权利和义务，向领导党和政府反映各种情况，指出执行上的缺点和提出建议，更为便利。它的监督作用自然能比分散的个人做得更好，是没有疑义的，但这种监督也仍然是人民监督的一部分，不过性质上是更属于内部的。人民的监督本来也是人民内部的事；这里所谓更属内部是指统一战线的内部，每个人民则不一定是统一战线的成员。所以民主党派的监督是更属内部，能做得更好的。并且监督是相互的，具有互相促进的作用。
    凡是为人民谋利益的政权，愈有人监督则工作便能做得愈好。因为如有偏差，缺点，错误，必须指出来才能纠正，如隐藏着没有注意到，则偏差只会扩大，不会自行消灭的，除非执行者自己发见，并且此时政策及理论水平已有提高，才能自觉地改正。这种情况也是有的，但不敢望普遍做到。因此民主党派必须做好这一内部工作。
    民主党派还有一项工作应该做。中国文化的发展是极不平衡的，一般地说是很落后的，只因为近代国际关系是极密切了，不像过去那样隔离与孤立，所以纵使在一个落后的国家里，进步的一方面的人士可以进步到国际水平或国际水平以上，这是容易理解之事。可是在最落后一方面，如前一些时候，罗瑞卿部长发言上说，在某一时期中，在中国竟找出二十七个“皇帝”来。他们不仅自己以皇帝自居，还有会道门的落后群众竟这样承认他们哩！实在太落后了。不过这些是公安部门管的事情，不是民主党派团结教育的对象。但社会上还另有一部分人们，他们可能或多或少的有一些进步要求，但是进步较慢或者很慢，民主党派就应分出一部分力量去联系他们。他们的政治开展虽然表现的慢，但如加以联系，予以帮助，因为社会主义建设是在前进，他们很有加快进步的可能。经过一个时期，他们的思想一到提高和进步之后，是有化消极的力量为积极的力量的可能的，这对于社会主义建设分明是大有利益。民主促进会的负责同志们，已都相信这是一项重要的工作。
    还有一个问题，是如何提高和发展思想的问题。发展思想，不如叫做解放思想更适切些。在旧社会里，思想本是大受束缚与压迫的。剥削者的统治异常仇视人民的思想和它的发展，人民如果多思想，对于剥削统治者是不利的。中国历史上虽没有像西洋教会的权力烧死和虐待科学发明家的事情，但压迫思想和反对知识的事实是有过的。别的不说，只要举统治中国思想界很长久的孔老夫子的“民可使由之，不可使知之”的话，就可以知道一般了。
    新中国生产建设进步很快，人民物质生活水平已在不断提高。但人民绝不以仅仅丰衣足食为满足。吃得好，穿得好，但是缺乏思想，长成一个像“脑满肠肥”的大腹贾实非人民所愿。人民要求有丰富的思想，感情，理智和高度的智慧。这一点，党中央原是非常注意的，“百家争鸣”，向科学进军，宣传唯物主义等都与解放思想，发展思考力有关系。只有思想的不断发展和不断提高，才能成为更高级的人类。
    在这方面，我想，民主党派也有应做的工作。民主促进会外省的分会，曾应会员和联系的群众的要求，做了一些这方面的工作：如开座谈会或讲演会之类，讲述一些理论上和业务上的问题。沈阳的民主促进会分会，在自己的工作中把向科学进军提高到重要的地位。中国人愿意有高的文化，但必须经过深沉的学习和研究，才能够有所成就。才能以一个高文化的民族出现于世界上；在社会主义建设上，发展思想与发展工业，是同等重要的。民主党派的成员和联系的群众共同来学习钻研学问，这是社会主义的重要工作，这不仅给民主党派增加了学习团体的性质，同时也加强了民主党派的政治性。
    总之作为民主党派之一的民主促进会，本来就立志要为社会主义建设尽一切可能的力量的，以上讲到的只是扼要的提出几点，此外，凡是利于建设社会主义的事当然都应当参加去做，没有疑义。我相信民主促进会的成员与联系的群众一起，在这些工作上是愿意献出自己的力量来的。
