    At the Legal Advisory Office
    Xing Ke
    Every morning, the waiting room and corridors of the Beijing First Legal Advisory Office are crowded with people. They have all sorts of problems: some with debt issues, some with housing issues, some with marriage issues, seeking help from the Legal Advisory Office to resolve them. On June 25th, although it rained all day, there were still many people waiting here.
    In each reception room, lawyers patiently answered questions from the public and drafted legal documents. A woman named He Zeqin requested the advisory office to draft a divorce appeal for her. Before starting to write, lawyer Liu Shufen kindly advised her to reconcile with her husband. Tan Binglan was very distressed because her husband's younger brother had been sentenced to imprisonment, and she didn't know whether she should appeal. Now, she told lawyer Song Zifen about this situation and found a solution.
    In another courtyard, the clatter of a typewriter could be heard from a room from time to time, where typists were busy printing legal documents for people. In another room, lawyers were holding a meeting, attentively discussing defense statements. It turned out that lawyer Fu Zhiren was going to court that afternoon to defend a case!
    The lawyers of the First Legal Advisory Office work so diligently. Since its establishment on April 26th, this advisory office has answered legal inquiries, drafted legal documents, and accepted cases as defenders and agents for a total of 1,285 person-times, with answering legal inquiries being the most frequent. People who have been helped often come here to express their gratitude. The family woman Lü Yunting suffered discrimination from her elder brothers and sisters-in-law for many years because her husband died early. With the help of the Legal Advisory Office, the problem was resolved relatively quickly. She gratefully said, "Thanks to you, I have a place in my family!"

    在法律顾问处
    邢克
    每天早上，北京市第一法律顾问处的休息室和过道里便挤满了人。他们有着各种各样的问题：有的是债务问题，有的是房屋问题，有的是婚姻问题，来要求法律顾问处帮助他们解决。六月二十五日这天，虽然一直下着小雨，但等待在这里的人仍然很多。
    在各个接待室里，律师们耐心地给群众解答着问题，撰写着法律文件。妇女何泽琴要求顾问处代她写离婚上诉书，律师刘淑芬在动笔以前，还善意地劝解她能同丈夫和解。谭秉兰，她丈夫的弟弟被判处了徒刑，她不知道是否还应该上诉，非常苦恼。现在她把这一情况告诉了律师宋子芬，得到了解决。
    在另一个庭院，从一个房间里不时传出哒哒的打字声，这是打字员在忙着为人们打印法律文件。另一个房间里，律师们正在开会，聚精会神地讨论着辩护词。原来傅志人律师当天下午就要出庭作辩护了！
    第一法律顾问处的律师们，就是这样紧张地工作着。这个顾问处自四月二十六日成立以来，他们解答法律询问、撰写法律文件，以及接受作辩护人、代理人的案件共1，285人次，其中以解答法律询问的最多。受到帮助的人，常常到这里来致谢。家庭妇女吕云婷因丈夫早死，多年在家庭中受兄嫂歧视。她在法律顾问处帮助下，使问题较快地得到了解决。她感激地说：“多亏有了你们，才使我在家中有了地位！”
