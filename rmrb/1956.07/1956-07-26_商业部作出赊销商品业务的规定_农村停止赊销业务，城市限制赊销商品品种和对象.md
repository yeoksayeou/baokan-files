Xinhua News Agency, July 25th. The Ministry of Commerce of the People's Republic of China issued an instruction to the commercial departments and bureaus of all provinces, cities, and autonomous regions on the 23rd, making several provisions regarding the business of selling goods on credit in urban and rural areas.

The instruction stated that since the commercial departments began offering sales on credit, it has played a certain role in expanding the sales of certain commodities and meeting the needs of some consumers, but in many places, there has been some confusion, with goods being sold on credit that should not be.

The instruction stipulates that, apart from the small power generation equipment that has already been promised to be sold on credit to agricultural production cooperatives, all sales on credit to rural areas should be stopped; in cities, the commodities sold on credit are limited to watches priced above 300 yuan and cameras priced above 250 yuan. The targets of sales on credit are limited to staff and workers of state organs, organizations, schools, factories, mines, and enterprises (including joint state-private enterprises with fixed interest rates) and cadres of military organs with fixed locations.

The instruction stipulates that the sales on credit of the above commodities should be handled only after the consumer voluntarily submits an application and it is reviewed, and there should be no forced sales on credit. If state-owned companies and localities find it necessary to increase the varieties of goods sold on credit, they must report to the Ministry of Commerce for approval before they can increase them.

    商业部作出赊销商品业务的规定
    农村停止赊销业务，城市限制赊销商品品种和对象
    新华社25日讯　中华人民共和国商业部在二十三日向各省、市、自治区商业厅、局发出指示，对城乡赊销商品的业务作了几项规定。
    指示说，商业部门在开办赊销业务以来，对扩大某些商品的推销和满足部分消费者的需要起了一定的作用，但不少地方发生了一些混乱，把不应赊销的商品进行赊销。
    指示规定，除了已经答应赊销给农业生产合作社的小型发电设备仍旧应该赊销以外，对农村一律停止赊销；在城市，赊销的商品限于三百元以上一只的手表和二百五十元以上一只的照相机，赊销对象限于国家机关、团体、学校、厂矿、企业（包括实行定息的公私合营企业）的职工及固定驻地的军事机关干部。
    指示规定，上述商品的赊销都应该由消费者自愿提出申请经审查后办理，不得有任何强迫赊销的现象。各国营公司和各地如果有必要增加赊销商品品种，必须报商业部批准后才可以增加。
