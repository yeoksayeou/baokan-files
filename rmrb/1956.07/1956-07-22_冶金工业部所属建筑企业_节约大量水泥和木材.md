Construction Enterprises Under the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry
Save Large Amounts of Cement and Wood

    (Our dispatch) The construction enterprises under the Construction Bureau of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry have saved a large amount of cement and wood for the country in the first half of the year.

    The demand for wood and cement by the construction enterprises under the Construction Bureau of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry in the first half of this year generally increased by 50% to 100% compared to the same period last year. Therefore, each construction enterprise has paid more attention to the issue of saving construction materials than in previous years.

    Regarding cement conservation, from January to June of this year, eight construction enterprises have adopted the advanced experience of Soviet dry-hardened concrete. Using this type of concrete can save 15% of cement compared to ordinary concrete. From January to June, the Sixth Construction General Company used more than 15,100 cubic meters of dry-hardened concrete, saving 850 tons of cement. Five construction enterprises have adopted admixtures such as fly ash, red brick ash, and clay, generally saving 15% to 30% of cement. From January to May, the Anshan Construction General Company used tailings powder admixtures in foundation projects, saving 2,020 tons of cement. According to incomplete statistics from Anshan and the Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, and Seventh Construction General Companies, more than 15,000 tons of cement were saved in the first half of the year.

    Regarding wood conservation, many units have promoted the use of bamboo instead of wood. In the first half of the year, the Ninth Construction General Company used bamboo instead of wood for scaffolding, making planks, formwork, retaining boards, and rainproof equipment, saving more than 2,000 cubic meters of wood on eight major projects alone. The Second Company of the Seventh Construction General Company used bamboo to replace more than 1,300 cubic meters of wood. Many units have promoted the use of flip-type formwork, which has increased the turnover rate of formwork and also played a significant role in saving wood. In total, the construction units under the Construction Bureau saved more than 12,000 cubic meters of wood in the first half of the year.

    冶金工业部所属建筑企业
    节约大量水泥和木材
    本报讯　冶金工业部建筑局所属各建筑企业，上半年为国家节约了大量的水泥和木料。
    冶金工业部建筑局所属各建筑企业，今年上半年所需要的木料和水泥，普遍比去年同期增加半倍到一倍以上。因此，各个建筑企业比往年更加重视了节约建筑材料的问题。
    在节约水泥方面，从今年一月到六月已经有八个建筑企业采用了苏联的干硬性混凝土的先进经验。使用这种混凝土，比一般混凝土可以节约15％的水泥。第六建筑总公司一到六月份使用了一万五千一百多立方公尺的干硬性混凝土，节约了八百五十吨水泥。有五个建筑企业采用了粉煤灰，红砖灰、粘土等掺合料，一般都节约了15％到30％的水泥。鞍山建筑总公司一到五月份在基础工程中使用尾矿粉掺合料，节约了两千零二十吨水泥。据鞍山和第四、第五、第六、第七等四个建筑总公司的不完全统计，上半年共节约水泥一万五千吨以上。
    在节约木料方面，很多单位都推广了以竹材代替木材的办法。第九建筑总公司上半年用竹材代替木材搭脚手架，制跳板、模板、挡土板和防雨设备，仅在八个主要工程上就节约了两千多立方公尺的木材。第七建筑总公司的第二公司利用竹材代替了一千三百多立方公尺木材。很多单位推广了翻转式模板，提高模板的周转率，对节约木材也起了很大作用。总计在上半年内建筑局所属各建筑单位节约的木材共有一万二千多立方公尺。
