Xinhua News Agency, London, July 10th: Soviet Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers, Malyshev, and a group of technical experts accompanying him have arrived in London.

They are here to discuss expanding Anglo-Soviet trade with representatives of the British government. During their visit to Britain in April this year, Soviet leaders Bulganin and Khrushchev proposed such talks to specifically discuss the Soviet proposal that, in the absence of trade restrictions or discrimination, the Soviet Union could purchase goods worth 800 million to 1 billion pounds from Britain over the next five years.
