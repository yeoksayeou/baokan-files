    Northwest Region Builds One Thousand Homes for Construction Workers

    (Our newspaper dispatch) The Northwest First Engineering Company of the Ministry of Construction Engineering has decided to build a batch of houses for construction workers in the near future. The first phase of housing, which can accommodate one thousand households, began construction on July 11 and will be completed successively in August and September. The residential area will include nurseries, public canteens, bathhouses, shops, health stations, film screening grounds, and small gardens.

    In order to implement the principle of thrift, all buildings will use bamboo structures, flat tiles, and adobe walls (plastered inside and out). Doors and windows will be processed and manufactured using waste wood from the construction site.

    The Northwest First Engineering Company has more than 40,000 employees. In the past, although the dormitories of the construction units solved the housing problem for most workers, there were still more than 3,000 households of employees who did not have fixed housing. After the workers raised their opinions at the staff and worker representative meeting, the company administration and the trade union decided to allocate approximately 750,000 yuan from the welfare fund to build the first batch of houses. This news greatly encouraged the production enthusiasm of the construction workers. (Huang Dongyu)

    西北地区为建筑工人修建一千户住宅
    本报讯　建筑工程部西北第一工程公司决定在最近期间为建筑工人修建一批住宅，第一期可容一千户居住的住宅已经在七月十一日动工修建，将在八、九月间陆续完工。住宅区里将修建托儿所、公共食堂、澡堂、商店、保健站、电影放映场和小花园等。
    为了贯彻节约原则，全部建筑将采用竹结构、平瓦、土坯墙（内外粉刷），门窗将利用工地上的废木料加工制造。
    西北第一工程公司共有四万多名职工，过去虽然利用建设单位的宿舍解决了大部分工人的住宅问题，但是还有三千多户职工没有固定房子住。工人在职工代表会议上提出意见以后，公司行政方面和工会就决定从福利金中拨出约七十五万元来修建第一批住宅。这个消息传出以后，大大鼓舞了建筑工人的生产情绪。　（黄东瑜）
