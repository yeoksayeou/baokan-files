Xinhua News Agency Report:

    China's oldest library, the Tianyi Pavilion in Ningbo, which was established more than 390 years ago, has changed its past restrictions since liberation. It is now open to the public for regular visits, and those who need to consult the collection are allowed to enter the pavilion for reading. By the end of June this year, it had received 100,000 visitors.

    The Tianyi Pavilion was founded by Fan Qin in the Ming Dynasty, around 1561 to 1566, and is the oldest existing library in China. The pavilion houses many valuable cultural classics, including books on classics, history, philosophy, and literary collections. At its peak, it held more than 70,000 volumes. After several losses, more than 14,000 volumes remain, totaling more than 1,500 titles, many of which are rare Song and Yuan dynasty editions. The most valuable books in the collection are more than 270 kinds of Ming Dynasty local chronicles, including county chronicles, prefectural chronicles, general chronicles, and those of various provinces. In addition, there are 389 kinds of records of imperial examinations from the early to late Ming Dynasty. Both are direct historical materials of the Ming Dynasty and are of great value for historical research.

    From the establishment of the Tianyi Pavilion until before liberation, the books in the pavilion had almost no contact with the academic community, except for the more than 600 kinds that were used in the compilation of the Siku Quanshu (Complete Library of the Four Branches of Literature) during the Qianlong period of the Qing Dynasty. The library was closed all year round, and even visits were difficult. After liberation, the Tianyi Pavilion became a cultural institution serving the general public. In addition to regularly receiving thousands of domestic visitors, it has also received many international friends.

    Mr. Fan Luqi, who is in charge of the Tianyi Pavilion, recently told Xinhua News Agency reporters that in order to enable the collection of the Tianyi Pavilion to play a role in the national upsurge of academic research, they plan to provide a batch of Tianyi Pavilion catalogs, compiled and printed in 1940, to academic research institutions and libraries across the country. Those who need to consult the collection in the pavilion can entrust them to make photocopies of the original books.

    我国历史最悠久的藏书楼——天一阁
    新华社讯　建立了三百九十多年的宁波天一阁藏书楼，从解放以来，改变过去历代的禁例，定期开放供人参观，并准许需要参考藏书的人进阁阅览，到今年六月底，已经接待了十万个参观者。
    天一阁是明朝人范钦在公元1561年到1566年前后创建的，也是我国现存的一座历史最悠久的藏书楼。阁内藏有许多珍贵的文化典籍，经部、史部、子部和文集等书，最多时有七万多卷，后来几经散失，留存到现在的还有一万四千多卷，计一千五百多种，其中不少是目前罕见的宋元刻本。藏书中最名贵的是二百七十多种明代地方志，包括县志、府志、通志，各省的都有，另外还有从明朝初年到末年的试士录三百八十九种，两者都是明朝的直接史料，在历史研究上极有价值。
    从天一阁创建到解放以前几百年来，阁内的藏书除了在清朝乾隆时修四库全书被采用了六百多种以外，和学术界几乎没有接触，书楼终年关闭，连参观也很困难。解放以后，天一阁才成为了一所接待广大群众的文化机构，它除了经常接待成千成百的本国参观者以外，还接待了不少国际友人。
    负责管理天一阁的范鹿其先生最近告诉新华社记者，为了使天一阁的藏书在全国学术研究高潮中发挥作用，他们准备把留存的一批在1940年编印的天一阁书目供应给全国的学术研究机关和图书馆；需要参考阁内藏书的，可以委托他们照原书样子影抄。
