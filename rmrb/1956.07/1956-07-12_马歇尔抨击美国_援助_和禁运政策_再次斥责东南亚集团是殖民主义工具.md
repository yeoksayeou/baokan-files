Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, July 11th: According to International News Service Tokyo, the former Chief Minister of Singapore and leader of the Labour Front, David Marshall, who is currently visiting Japan, reiterated his opposition to the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization (SEATO) on July 10th, stating that SEATO is "an instrument for promoting colonialism in Southeast Asia." "(It) provides a base for achieving imperialist aims, and if this can happen in Singapore, it can happen anywhere." Marshall added that he did not believe that Southeast Asia was in danger of military aggression from China.

Speaking on the issue of U.S. foreign "aid," Marshall said that one example of clumsy U.S. handling was its insistence on providing military aid to Asian countries rather than economic aid. He believed that the U.S. emphasis on military aid was a mistake. He said that Southeast Asia needs constructive aid projects and does not need military aid to be used for destruction.

Marshall expressed regret over Western trade embargo policies. He said that the embargo hinders Singapore and other Southeast Asian countries from trading with China. He said, "It only harms us. Singapore needs trade."

Marshall said that Singapore is by no means neutral. "Neutralism does not apply to Singapore because we are realists there, and we recognize that Singapore has a very important role to play in the defense of the free world." He then said, "But let us have internal autonomy and stop manipulating us arbitrarily."

    马歇尔抨击美国“援助”和禁运政策
    再次斥责东南亚集团是殖民主义工具
    新华社11日讯　据国际新闻社东京消息，正在日本访问的新加坡前首席部长、劳工阵线主席马歇尔七月十日再次表示反对东南亚条约组织，他说，东南亚条约组织是“在东南亚促进殖民主义的一个工具”。“（它）提供了实现帝国主义目的的基地，这种情况如果能够在新加坡发生，也就能够在任何地方发生。”马歇尔又说，他并不认为东南亚有遭受中国的军事侵略的危险。
    马歇尔谈到美国对外“援助”问题时说，美国处理得笨拙的例子之一，就是它坚持要给予亚洲国家以军事援助而不给予经济援助。他认为美国把重点放在军事援助上是错误的。他说，东南亚需要建设性的援助项目，并不需要用来进行破坏的军事援助。
    马歇尔对西方的贸易禁运政策表示遗憾。他说，禁运妨碍新加坡和其他东南亚国家同中国进行贸易。他说，“它所损害的就只有我们。新加坡需要贸易”。
    马歇尔说，新加坡绝不是中立的。“中立主义不适用于新加坡，因为我们是那里的现实主义者，我们认识到新加坡在自由世界的防御中要起非常重要的作用。”他接着说，“但是，让我们有内部自治，不要再任意摆布我们。”
