    "How much for him?" "Two bananas."
    According to reports, in French Cameroon in West Africa, a worker in some places receives only seven CFA francs per hour. At the same time, the French buy agricultural products at low prices, paying less than half a CFA franc for a banana; however, when these bananas are sold in Paris restaurants, one banana sells for fifty francs (equivalent to twenty-five CFA francs). This means that if a Parisian eats two bananas after a meal, he consumes almost a day's income of a Cameroonian worker.

    “给他多少？”　“两只香蕉。”
    据报载，在西非法属喀麦隆，有的地方一个工人每小时的工作只得到七个喀麦隆法郎的报酬。同时，法国人低价收购农产品，一只香蕉只付给不到半个喀麦隆法郎；可是拿到巴黎餐馆里，一只香蕉就要卖五十个法郎（合二十五个喀麦隆法郎）。这就是说，如果一个巴黎人饭后吃上两只香蕉，他就吃掉了一个喀麦隆工人将近一天的收入。
