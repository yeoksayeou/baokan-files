Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, July 15th – Nie Zhiwei, former deputy company commander of the Chiang Kai-shek army who returned to the mainland from Taiwan, said excitedly at a welcome meeting here today: "I am very lucky to have returned to the mainland, but I will never forget the Taiwanese compatriots who are still in dire straits. I want to contribute my strength to the liberation of Taiwan."

Nie Zhiwei, representing Chiang Kai-shek soldiers Zhang Dailin, Wang Jialun, and Huang Kunxiong, who recently returned to the mainland, called on military and government personnel and their friends and colleagues in Taiwan to respond to the call of the motherland, oppose the United States' occupation of Taiwan, and strive to perform meritorious service for the liberation of Taiwan under the banner of patriotism. Nie Zhiwei and others also revealed to the more than 1,500 people who welcomed them the crimes of Americans killing children and insulting women in Taiwan. Nie Zhiwei said that he once saw an American military vehicle crush a child to death in Taiwan like it was running over a chick. He said that Americans in Taiwan do not value the lives of Chinese people.

At 8:00 a.m., Nie Zhiwei and others walked into the meeting place, and warm applause rang out throughout the venue. Yan Shuxia, Deputy Mayor of Fuzhou, delivered a speech, welcoming and encouraging their heroic act of breaking away from the Chiang Kai-shek army under American control and returning to the mainland. He Xuchu, a female teacher from Fuzhou No. 5 Middle School who spoke at the meeting, hoped that her second elder brother, who is still in the Chiang Kai-shek army in Taiwan, would one day return to the embrace of the motherland like Nie Zhiwei and others to reunite with his family.

Also speaking at today's welcome meeting were representatives of the People's Liberation Army stationed in the Fuzhou area, uprising general and member of the Fujian Provincial People's Committee Lian Tisheng, Vice Chairman of the Fuzhou Municipal Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference Liu Yongye, and Zhao Jiaxin, a representative of the Fuzhou Municipal Democratic Youth Federation.

    福州一千五百人集会
    欢迎渡海归来蒋军官兵
    新华社福州15日电　从台湾回到祖国大陆的前蒋军副连长聂智威，今天在此间的一个欢迎会上兴奋地说：“我现在很幸运回到了祖国大陆，但我决不忘记还在水深火热中的台湾同胞，我要为解放台湾而贡献自己的力量。”
    聂智威代表最近先后回到大陆的蒋军士兵张代林、王家轮和黄坤雄，向在台湾的军政人员和他们的朋友、同事们提出，要求他们响应祖国的号召，反对美国霸占台湾，在爱国主义旗帜下争取为解放台湾立功。聂智威等人还向欢迎他们的一千五百多人揭露了美国人在台湾残杀儿童和侮辱妇女的罪恶事实。聂智威说，有一次他亲眼看到美国军车在台湾像辗小鸡一样把一个小孩子压死了。他说，在台湾的美国人是不重视中国人的生命的。
    上午八时，聂智威等人走进会场，会场上响起了热烈的掌声。福州市副市长严叔夏致词，欢迎和勉励他们脱离美国控制下的蒋军部队而回到祖国大陆的英勇行为。在会上讲话的福州市第五中学女教师何旭初，希望她现在还在台湾蒋军部队中的二哥，有一天也像聂智威等人一样回到祖国的怀抱来和家人团聚。
    今天在欢迎会上讲话的还有中国人民解放军驻福州地区的部队代表，起义将领、福建省人民委员会委员练惕生，中国人民政治协商会议福州市委员会副主席刘永业和福州市民主青年联合会代表赵家欣等人。
