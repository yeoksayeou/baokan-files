    Growing Vegetables on Hainan Island
    Song Qun
    Everyone who has eaten in the artillery battalion's soldiers' mess hall says that their meals are well-prepared. Each meal consists of two dishes and a soup, with a wide variety of dishes, all cooked deliciously. Since the beginning of this year, the weight of all the comrades in the battalion has generally increased, with the most significant increase being six kilograms. The new recruits who enlisted this year, after examination, did not have any illnesses due to malnutrition.
    If you ask them why they can provide such good meals, their answer is very simple: we grow our own vegetables.
    Around their barracks, there are about seven mu of land planted with various vegetables: scallions, peppers, eggplants, winter melons, chives... Whatever the kitchen needs, a quick trip to the vegetable garden will provide it all. In the vegetable garden, you can see large winter melons lying under the trellises, some weighing more than thirty kilograms; red peppers, with thirteen or fourteen growing on one branch; the scallions grow straight and tall, over a foot high, completely comparable to the famous Shandong scallions. According to statistics, from December of last year to April of this year alone, they harvested 31,092 catties of vegetables, achieving a large degree of self-sufficiency in vegetables. Over the past year, they used the surplus money from vegetables to buy pigs and cattle, and through breeding, they now have thirty-four pigs, large and small, and six cattle. In addition, they also bought two plows and a waterwheel.
    Growing vegetables may be commonplace in other areas and nothing remarkable. However, here, on Hainan Island in southern China, it is not a simple matter. Initially, people said that vegetables only grew for a few months around winter, and that in June, July, and August, the land was like a fire oven, and nothing would grow at all. Even if you sowed seeds, the seedlings would wither. Some said that the soil here was sandy and that the vegetables would flower before they grew tall and stop growing. Therefore, for the troops stationed on Hainan Island, vegetables were a problem that had not been solved for a long time.
    When the artillery battalion first moved into the barracks, this long-unsolved problem became even more prominent. Sometimes, even after traveling hundreds of miles, they couldn't buy any vegetables. Even if they bought some, after deducting transportation costs and spoilage, the soldiers didn't get to eat much. At that time, although they were eating small quantities of poor-quality vegetables, they were still overspending their food budget. After the implementation of in-kind supply, the price of vegetables was no longer a factor affecting food quality for small units. However, from the perspective of the entire army, vegetables remained a serious problem. Many vegetables had to be shipped across the sea from the mainland; even potatoes had to be transported by train from the Northeast, and scallions from Shandong. In response to this situation, at the beginning of 1955, the leadership put forward the slogan of learning from the spirit of Nanniwan in growing vegetables to achieve self-sufficiency, so that Hainan Island could also have green vegetables all year round.
    The artillery battalion responded to the call of the leadership and mobilized everyone to grow vegetables in their spare time from training. They plowed the wasteland around the barracks and sowed the seeds. Everyone cherished them like treasures, carefully tending to them. At noon, when the sun was too hot, they were afraid of damaging the seedlings, so they ran out to water them. During afternoon breaks, some used small shovels, while others simply used their hands to loosen the soil. They waited and hoped that the vegetables would grow strong and healthy. However, the reality was the opposite of their hopes: some seedlings withered before they had grown for a few days. Even the radishes that they managed to grow with great effort were small and thin, and didn't look like radishes at all. Many comrades looked at the sandy soil and said: What the old folks say is true, it is impossible to grow vegetables in this kind of sandy soil with this kind of climate!
    At that time, the artillery battalion commander, Comrade Zhu Hongyun, did not lose heart. He mobilized everyone to look for the reasons again, to see exactly why they couldn't grow vegetables well. The head of the cooking squad, Xiao Quanjun, had grown vegetables at home, so he was asked to study the problem together. Whenever he had time, Battalion Commander Zhu would stroll around the vegetable garden. Later, the reasons were finally found, and the solutions were also devised. For example, some seedlings withered after growing for a few days because when watering, they only cared about splashing water on the seedlings with basins, but didn't pay attention to washing away the soil around the roots; some were not planted deep enough, and when the sun came out, the surface of the soil dried out, and the seedlings withered; some had insects in the roots, which were not eliminated in time; others only spread a layer of fertilizer on the surface, which didn't have much effect. Based on these findings, they improved the watering method. In March of last year, the entire battalion mobilized to build a water barrier dam more than eighty meters long near the vegetable garden, blocking the water flowing down from the mountain, completely solving the water source problem. Battalion Commander Zhu also first tested the method of deep planting tomato seedlings; Supply Platoon Leader Qi Lianjun and others studied methods for killing and removing insects. The tomatoes grown by the battalion commander were red and big, and beans and cabbages also grew. The scallion seeds that the battalion commander brought back from his visit to his home in Shandong, and the pepper seeds that the second company commander brought back from his visit to his home in the Northeast, grew on this hot, stony, and sandy soil, and were no less impressive than they would have been in their native soil.
    Vegetables are spread all around the barracks, and under the care and cultivation of all the officers and soldiers of the battalion, they are producing more and more, and producing better and better every day. These vegetables not only directly improved the food of the artillery battalion, but also vividly and powerfully broke the various claims that vegetables cannot be grown in the summer on Hainan Island.

    海南岛上种青菜
    宋群
    凡是在炮兵营战士食堂吃过饭的人，都说他们的伙食办得好。每顿饭两菜一汤，菜的花样多，也炒得有滋味。今年以来全营的同志体重普遍增加，最多的竟增加了六公斤。今年入伍的新兵，经过检查，也没有一个因为营养不良而发生病症的。
    要问他们，为什么能把伙食办得这样好呢？他们的回答很简单：我们自己种了青菜。
    在他们营房周围，约有七亩左右的土地上，长满了各种各样的青菜：大葱、辣椒、茄子、冬瓜、韭菜……伙房里需要甚么，只要到菜地里转上一遭，就一应俱全了。在菜地里，你可以看到，躺在架棚下的大冬瓜，有的重达三十多斤；红色的辣椒，在一枝上就长了十三四只；那大葱长得挺直，有一尺多高，完全可以和著名的山东大葱比美。据统计，仅仅从去年十二月到今年四月，他们就收获了三万一千零九十二斤蔬菜，做到了大部蔬菜自给。一年来，他们用节余的菜金，买了猪和牛，经过繁殖，现在已经有大、小猪三十四只，牛六条，此外，还买了两部耕犁和一部水车。
    种菜的事，在别的地区也许是平平常常，没有什么了不起的。但是，在这里，在祖国南方的海南岛上，却不是一件简单的事。最初，人们传说这里一年四季，只有冬季前后几个月还长点菜，到了六、七、八月，土地像火烤的一样，根本就不长菜。就是撒上种子，小苗长出来也要枯萎的；有的说，这里是砂土地，菜长不高就开花，不再长了。因此，驻在海南岛上的部队，蔬菜是一个长时间没有解决的问题。
    炮兵营刚刚进驻营房的时候，这个长时间没有解决的问题就更加突出了。有时跑出几百里外，也买不到一点菜，就是买了点菜回来，去掉运费和耗损，战士们吃到口的也就不多了。那时虽然吃着量少质差的菜，却还超支了一笔菜金。实行实物供应以后，对小单位来说，菜价高低已不是影响伙食的原因，但是，从整个部队来看，蔬菜仍是个严重问题。许多菜要渡海到大陆上去买；甚至坐上火车到东北调运土豆，到山东调运大葱。根据这种情况，1955年初领导上提出了学习南泥湾种菜自给自足的精神，让海南岛上也常年长青菜的口号来。
    炮兵营响应了领导的号召，动员大家在训练的空隙时间里种菜。他们刨开了营房周围的荒地，撒下了菜种。大家真是当作宝贝似的细心经营，中午太阳太热，大家怕晒坏了小苗，就跑出来浇水；下午休息的时候，有的用小锹，有的干脆就用手来把地耙松。今天盼，明天盼，希望青菜茁壮地成长起来。可是，事实和希望相反：有的小苗还没长几天就枯死了，就是费了很大劲种活了的一些萝卜，也长得又小又瘦不像样子。很多同志望着这砂土地说：老百姓的话是有道理的，这种砂土地再加上这种气候，怎么可能长出青菜来呢！
    当时的炮兵营长朱鸿运同志可没有灰心。他动员大家再找找原因，看看究竟为什么种不好。炊事班长肖全均在家里种过菜，就找他来一起研究研究，一有空朱营长就到菜地里蹓跶蹓跶。后来，原因到底找到了，办法也想出来了。比方，有些小苗长几天就枯，那是因为浇水的时候，只顾用脸盆往苗上泼，却没注意把苗根土冲走了；有的是栽得不深，太阳一出来，地皮上干了，苗也就枯了；有的是根子里生了虫子，没有及时消灭；还有的是只在表面铺了一层肥料，起不了什么作用。根据这些情况，他们改进了浇水的方法，去年三月间全营动员，在菜地附近修了一条长八十多公尺的拦水坝，挡住了从山上流下来的水，彻底解决了水源问题。朱营长还首先试验了深栽西红柿苗的方法；供给排长戚连均等人，研究了杀虫、除虫的办法。营长种的西红柿又红又大，豆角、白菜也长起来了。营长到山东探家带回来的大葱种，和二连长到东北探家带回来的辣椒种，都在这炎热的石沙很多的土地上长了起来，并且一点儿也不次于这些种子在它们故乡土地上长出来的样子。
    青菜铺满在营房周围，它们在全营官兵的爱护培植下，一天比一天出产得多、出产得好。这些菜不仅直接改善了炮兵营的伙食，并且生动有力地打破了海南岛夏天不能种菜的种种说法。
