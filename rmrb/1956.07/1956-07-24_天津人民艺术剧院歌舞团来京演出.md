    Tianjin People's Art Theatre Song and Dance Troupe Performs in Beijing

    (Our report) The Tianjin People's Art Theatre Song and Dance Troupe began its performance at the Beijing People's Theatre on the 21st. This is the song and dance troupe's first performance in Beijing.

    The song and dance troupe was formally established in 1953, consisting of all or part of the members of several cultural work troupes such as the North China Mass Theatre. In the past, they have created some excellent works loved by the masses, such as the songs "Without the Communist Party, There Would Be No New China" and "Ode to the Motherland", and the dance "Dock Workers' Dance". In the past few years, the song and dance troupe has also made efforts to learn from the folk arts, such as the processed and adapted Hebei local Yangko: "Sawing the Crock" and "Beating the Bear," the adapted folk song chorus: "Praising the Son-in-Law" and "Wang Sanjie Goes to the Fair," as well as folk instrumental music such as "Selling Vegetables," all of which have won praise from the audience.

    This time, the song and dance troupe also brought many newly arranged programs, such as the dances "Bench Dance" and "Gu Zi Yangko," the chorus "Agriculturalization Medley," the adapted folk song "The Plain Truth," and other instrumental solos.

    天津人民艺术剧院歌舞团来京演出
    本报讯　天津人民艺术剧院歌舞团二十一日起在北京市人民剧场公演。这是歌舞团的第一次来京演出。
    歌舞团是由华北群众剧社等几个文工团的全部或一部分成员，在1953年正式组成的。过去，他们曾创作过一些优秀的、为广大群众喜爱的作品。如：歌曲“没有共产党就没有新中国”“歌唱祖国”，舞蹈
  “码头工人舞”等。几年来，歌舞团在向民间学习方面也作了努力，如加工改编的河北地方秧歌：“锯缸”“打熊”，改编的民歌合唱：
  “夸女婿”“王三姐赶集”以及民间器乐曲：“卖菜”等节目，均博得观众的好评。
    这一次歌舞团还带来了不少新排的节目，如：舞蹈“板舞”“鼓子秧歌”，合唱：“农业化联唱”，改编的民歌“大实话”以及其他器乐独奏等。
