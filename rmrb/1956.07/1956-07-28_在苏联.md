    In the Soviet Union
    "Air Motorcycle"
    The Soviet Union has recently successfully tested a new type of helicopter, the "KA-10," which was successfully trial-produced under the leadership of designer N.I. Kamov. It will soon be mass-produced. The new helicopter has two overlapping rotors, a lightweight engine, a driver's seat, and a control stick. At the bottom are two long tubular pontoons. That's all it's equipped with. The advantages of this helicopter are practicality, lightness, and economy. It is very small; at a low altitude of four or five hundred meters, it already looks like a black dot. It does not need to look for a landing point; a piece of land of five to six square meters is enough for it to land. It requires very little fuel, only ten to twenty liters of gasoline for every hundred kilometers of flight. It can fly to an altitude of 2,500 meters and hover a few meters above the ground. Its total weight is only 200 kilograms, making it easy to carry, disassemble, and reassemble. After disassembly, it can be transported by ordinary aircraft, and it can be assembled in just half an hour. Therefore, people have given this helicopter the nickname "Air Motorcycle." This helicopter has great practical value. It can be used to find fish shoals for fishing fleets at sea, protect forests from disasters, guide icebreakers navigating in the Arctic Ocean, and be used for road construction.
    
    New Passenger Ship with a Speed of 60 Kilometers per Hour
    According to the Soviet newspaper "Pravda," designers at the Red Sormovo Factory in Gorky City have designed a new type of passenger ship with hydrofoils. One of these passenger ships with thirty seats has recently undergone testing.
    This passenger ship is designed using new principles. When it travels at low speed, it is the same as an ordinary ship. However, as the speed increases, the supporting wings installed under the hull generate a large lifting force, causing the ship to rise above the water surface. At this time, only the wing surface of the supporting wings, the propulsion wheel, the rudder, and the part where the supporting wings are tightly connected to the hull are submerged in the water. This greatly reduces water resistance. Its usual speed in the water is 60 kilometers per hour.
    
    New Schools are Popular
    People in Moscow, Leningrad, and other cities are extremely interested in boarding schools and are applying for their children to be admitted. Many people, seeing that the number of places is limited this year, are pre-registering for next year. This year, 167 boarding schools will be established in the Russian Federation, enrolling more than 32,000 students. Admission is based on the voluntary application of parents, and parents must be local residents. This year, priority will be given to the children of families lacking childcare conditions, such as the children of single mothers and mothers with many children, the children of those disabled in combat and labor, and orphans. Orphans and children whose parents' wages are not high or who have many family members will have all expenses paid by the state after admission. Other children's parents will pay a portion of the expenses according to their salary level and the number of dependents they support.
    
    General education in boarding schools will be combined with social and labor education. It is expected that there will be various new measures. For example, Chinese has never been taught in Soviet middle schools. Starting from September 1, students at the 157th Boarding Middle School in the Leningrad District of Moscow will study Chinese and Indian languages (Hindi and Urdu). Graduates of this school must master these languages. This is a pilot project. The Moscow Municipal People's Education Bureau and the School Administration Bureau of the Russian Republic Ministry of Education are selecting teachers and compiling teaching plans. The syllabuses and textbooks for Chinese and Indian languages are being prepared by the Soviet Ministry of Higher Education. (Report from our Moscow correspondent)

    在苏联
    “空中摩托车”
    苏联最近试验成功了一种新的直升飞机——“KA——一○”式，这种飞机是在设计师尼·伊·卡莫夫领导下试制成功的，不久它将大量生产。新式直升飞机有两个上下重叠的螺旋桨、一个轻便发动机、一个驾驶员座、和一根操纵杆、最下面是二个长管状的轻气胎。这就是它的全部装备。这种直升飞机的优点是实用、轻便和经济。它的体积很小，在四五百公尺的低空已经像一个黑点一样。它不需要找寻着陆点，一块五—六平方公尺的地盘就足够它降落了。它需用的燃料极少，飞行一百公里只需十到二十公升汽油，它既可以飞行到二千五百公尺的高空，又可以吊悬在离地几公尺的空中。它的总重量才二百公斤，便于携带，易于拆卸和重新装配，拆卸后可以由普通飞机运走，只要半小时就可以把它装配起来。因此，人们已给这种直升飞机起了个绰号——“空中摩托车”。这种直升飞机的实用价值很大。它既可以在海洋上为捕鱼船队寻找鱼群，又可以保护森林免遭灾害；既可以为在北冰洋上航行的破冰船指路，又可以用于筑路。
    时速六十公里的新客船
    据苏联“真理报”报道，苏联高尔基城红色索尔莫沃工厂的设计师设计了一种有水下翼的新型客轮。一艘有三十个座位的这种客轮最近已经经过了试验。
    这种客轮是运用新的原理设计出来的。当它用低速度航行的时候，情形同普通的轮船一样。但是，随着速度的增加，装在船身下面的支撑翼就产生了很大的提升力，使船升上水面。这时候，沉在水下的只有支撑翼的翼面、推进轮、舵，以及支撑翼同船身紧紧连接的那一部分。这样，就大大减低了水的阻力。它在水中的通常速度是每小时六十公里。
    新型的学校受欢迎
    莫斯科、列宁格勒等等城市人们对寄宿学校兴趣极高，纷纷申请让自己的子女入学。许多人看到今年名额有限，预报到明年。今年在俄罗斯联邦将成立一百六十七所寄宿学校，招收三万二千多名学生。入学儿童必须凭父母的自愿并且父母必须是当地的居民。今年首先招收那些家庭缺乏抚养条件的儿女，如像独身的母亲和多子女的母亲的儿女、战斗中和劳动中残废者的儿女和孤儿。孤儿和其父母工资不高或者家口很多的儿童，入学后全部费用由国家负担。其他的儿童的父母，按他们的工资高低和赡养的家属的多少，付出一部分费用。
    寄宿学校的一般教育将和社会与劳动教育结合起来。预计将有种种新措施。例如，苏联中学从来没有学习汉语的。从九月一日开始，莫斯科市列宁格勒区第157寄宿中学的学生将学习汉语和印度语（印地语和乌尔都语）。这个学校的毕业生必须掌握这种文字。这是试点。莫斯科市人民教育局和俄罗斯共和国教育部学校管理局正在挑选教师和编制教学计划。汉语和印度语的教学大纲和课本正由苏联高等教育部准备中。　（本报莫斯科电）
