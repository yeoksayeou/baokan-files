	Washington and Bonn's Tricks
	Xí Línshēng
	Recently, the US and West German governments have been conducting a series of intense activities. They don't shy away from stating that their purpose is to use the German unification issue to fuel the "Cold War."
	After the meeting between Adenauer and Dulles in June, Dulles openly claimed that this meeting was a "pressure" on the Soviet Union. Subsequently, West German Foreign Minister von Brentano also delivered a similar foreign policy statement in parliament.
	However, the Soviet Union's position on the German issue is well known. As in the past, the Soviet Union still advocates that Germany be unified into a peace-loving and democratic country. The path to German unification should primarily be through direct negotiations between the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany, while relevant countries should contribute to creating conditions conducive to German unification. This Soviet position is in line with the national interests of the German people and the interests of consolidating peace in Europe and the world. If the parties concerned, mainly Bonn and Washington, could adopt the same position, the German issue would be resolved smoothly, and trust and normal relations between countries would be more firmly established. These are all very obvious facts. Why are Bonn and Washington now putting so-called "pressure" on the Soviet Union?
	Adenauer's crude distortion and slander of Soviet policy before his visit to the United States proves that he and his Washington supporters first need to distort the Soviet Union's consistent and upright position in order to carry out an unspeakable deal, causing people to be confused. For this purpose, Adenauer resorted to unscrupulous means, relying on information that seemed to come from French leaders to insist that Khrushchev had said during his meeting with French government leaders in Moscow that the Soviet Union would rather maintain a divided Germany than have a unified, even neutral, Germany. Anyone who pays a little attention to the Soviet Union's consistent attitude on the German issue can see at a glance how crude this fabrication is. Adenauer did this in an attempt to create the impression that the Soviet Union opposes the restoration of German unity.
	In fact, it is the United States and its Bonn cronies who are most unwilling and doing everything possible to obstruct the restoration of German unity on a peaceful and democratic basis. The communique of the Dulles-Adenauer meeting also proves that what they are really concerned about has nothing to do with German unification. As widely pointed out by public opinion, the communique does not propose any new ways to help German unification from the current favorable world situation, but only rehashes the old plan of annexing the German Democratic Republic through so-called "free elections" from their arsenal of obstructing the resolution of the German issue in the past. They demand that the Soviet Union accept these conditions for their reunification of Germany before considering changing their attitude towards the Soviet Union. That is, as Reuters said, they "can do nothing but" merge East Germany into West Germany.
	All these outdated conspiracy tricks cannot fool people. People are already experienced in seeing through this: the reason why they are making a lot of noise on international issues that are currently difficult to resolve—mainly because Western countries are unwilling—is because their current situation is very bad, but they are unwilling to face reality and still want to go against the tide.
	The current international situation is conducive to creating conditions for resolving the German issue. Intensifying the revival of German militarism, strengthening the military machine of the North Atlantic Group, and other activities are increasingly out of touch with the times. Countries should strive to promote the resolution of outstanding international issues for the sake of consolidating universal peace, rather than creating new obstacles on international issues and undermining international understanding and trust. Recently, the Soviet Union announced the reduction of 1.2 million troops, including the disbandment of more than 30,000 troops stationed in the German Democratic Republic. If other countries take similar measures, it will greatly help resolve the issue of a unified Germany. However, Western governments have not shown corresponding sincerity.
	With the support of peace-loving people, the German Democratic Republic has been taking the initiative in seeking to resolve the German unification issue. It has repeatedly proposed holding talks with the West German government. The eight-point proposal by Premier Grotewohl not long ago put forward specific and feasible ways to conduct talks on improving relations between East and West Germany and creating internal conditions conducive to unification. On June 30, the government of the German Democratic Republic decided to reduce its army by 30,000 men, limiting the National People's Army to a level of 90,000 men. This has greatly eased the internal situation in Germany and created favorable conditions for consultations between the two parts of Germany to seek unification.
	Now, broad sections of people in West Germany, including people from various bourgeois political parties, and even some important members within Adenauer's own Christian Democratic Union, have expressed dissatisfaction with Adenauer's policy of obstructing German unification and demanded that it be changed. Social Democratic leaders have repeatedly pointed out that under conditions where tensions have eased, West Germany's policy must be thoroughly revised, because pursuing such a policy "can only sacrifice the reunification of Germany." Free Democratic Party leader Dehler also demanded that the West German government should change its foreign policy in consideration of the changes that have taken place in world politics. Recently, he also suggested negotiating with the German Democratic Republic on the issue of German reunification. At the recent Sixth Federal Congress of the Christian Democratic Union, there were historically "unprecedented" disagreements. All this, as the West German "Social Democratic News Bulletin" said, Adenauer "is actually in a completely isolated situation."
	It is precisely this development that has made the Washington and Bonn authorities, which are pursuing a policy of deepening the division of Germany and rearming West Germany, feel uneasy. In order to prop up the precarious position of the Adenauer group and block the favorable situation for a unified Germany, they once again resorted to slanderous propaganda against Soviet policy and were eager to tie new dead knots on the German issue. The famous American commentator Lippmann made a good explanation of Adenauer's visit to the United States. He pointed out: "Because of the loss of confidence in Dr. Adenauer at home, he came to Washington for help. He hopes to get evidence to prove that... the United States government wholeheartedly supports him and his own policies." He also believes that this meeting in Washington shows that Dulles and Adenauer "have adopted an attitude that has become an insurmountable obstacle to reunification," but this attitude is based on "subjective wishes and fantasies."
	The rigid attitude taken by Dulles and Adenauer has also aroused adverse reactions in the public opinion of Britain, France and other Western European countries. French Foreign Minister Pineau openly stated during his visit to the United States that he disagreed with the opinions of the Dulles-Adenauer communique, saying, "To say that nothing can be done before Russia resolves the German reunification issue is 'an exaggeration' of the importance of German reunification." According to a report by "New York Times" reporter Middleton, authoritative figures in London believe that "if Adenauer does not understand, then the United States should understand that in the issue of a unified Germany, the theory of the 'Cold War' must be abandoned."
	The West German public opinion and broad sections of the people have even more fiercely criticized the results of Adenauer's visit to the United States. "Die Welt" wrote: Adenauer and Dulles "are still at the center of the Cold War... they are going against the tide... the result may be that one day they will both fall into a more isolated situation than the isolation that has begun to appear today, and then they will be overwhelmed by the turbulent world political currents." Obviously, Washington's support has not strengthened Adenauer's position.
	The road to resolving the German issue is not narrow. But it is only possible to succeed if we adopt a policy that conforms to the interests of European and world peace, respects the German people's national right to solve their own problems, and faces up to the reality that there are currently two countries with different systems in Germany. More and more people in West German political circles recognize this. Even among American bourgeois political representatives, more sober remarks can be heard. For example, the influential American Senator Flanders believes that rearmament and reunification are "actually contradictory." He suggested establishing a free and unified Germany that agrees to disarm and remain neutral.
	It is not surprising that Dulles has publicly expressed a cold attitude towards Flanders's proposal. What is significant is that Dulles, with his "Cold War fever," has put himself in a very unenviable situation.

    华盛顿和波恩的花样
    席林生
    最近以来，美国和西德政府进行了一连串紧张的活动。他们并不讳言，其目的是在利用德国统一问题煽动“冷战”。
    六月间阿登纳和杜勒斯会谈之后，杜勒斯公然声称，这次会谈是对苏联施加的一个“压力”。接着，西德外长勃伦塔诺也在议会发表了一篇类似的外交政策声明。
    但是，苏联对德国问题的立场，是大家都知道的。像过去一样，苏联仍然主张德国统一成为爱好和平的民主的国家，而达到德国统一的道路，主要应由德意志民主共和国同德意志联邦共和国直接进行谈判，至于有关各国则应该为创造有利于促成德国统一的条件作出贡献。苏联这个立场，符合于德国人民的民族利益和巩固欧洲及世界和平的利益。如果有关方面，主要是波恩和华盛顿当局能够采取同样的立场，那末，德国问题就会顺利地得到解决，国与国之间的信任和正常关系也会更加坚固地确立起来。这都是十分明显的事实。为什么现在波恩和华盛顿方面要对苏联施加所谓“压力”呢？
    阿登纳在访美之前对苏联政策的粗暴歪曲和诬蔑，证明了他和他的华盛顿支持者为了进行一种不可告人的勾当，首先需要歪曲苏联的一贯的正直的立场，使人们发生迷惑。为此目的，阿登纳竟不择手段地根据仿佛是从法国领导人那里得来的消息硬说，赫鲁晓夫同法国政府领导人在莫斯科会谈期间曾经表示：苏联宁愿保持德国分裂，而不愿有一个统一的、即使是中立的德国。只要稍微注意苏联在德国问题上一贯表示的态度，都能一目了然这是多么粗暴的捏造。阿登纳这样作是企图造成一种印象，仿佛苏联反对德国恢复统一。
    实际上，现在最不愿意并多方阻挠在和平民主基础上恢复德国统一的正是美国和它的波恩伙计。杜勒斯和阿登纳的会谈公报，也证明了他们真正关心的事，是同德国的统一毫不相干的。正像广大舆论所指出的，公报丝毫没有从目前有利的世界形势中提出任何新的有助于德国统一的办法，而只是从过去他们阻挠德国问题的解决的武器库里，重新搬出通过所谓“自由选举”来吞并德意志民主共和国的老方案。他们要求苏联接受他们重新统一德国的这种条件，然后才能考虑改变对苏联的态度。也就是像路透社所说的，他们在使东德归并西德之外，“不能做旁的什么事”。
    这一切过时了的阴谋花样，是迷惑不了人的。人们已经有经验识破这一点：他们所以要在目前还难以解决——主要是因为西方国家不愿意——的国际问题上大叫大嚷，是因为他们目前的处境很不妙，但又不肯正视现实，并且还想逆流而行。
    目前的国际局势有利于创造解决德国问题的条件。加紧复活德国军国主义，加强北大西洋集团的军事机器等等活动，已经越来越不合时宜了。各国应该为了巩固普遍和平的利益，努力促进悬而未决的国际问题的解决，而不应该在国际问题上制造新的障碍，破坏国际谅解和信任。最近苏联宣布裁减一百二十万军队，包括解散驻扎在德意志民主共和国境内的三万多军队。如果其他国家也采取类似的措施，就将大大有助于解决统一德国的问题。但是西方国家政府却没有表现出相应的诚意。
    在爱好和平人民的支持下，德意志民主共和国一直在谋求解决德国统一问题方面采取了主动。它曾屡次提出与西德政府举行会谈的建议。不久前格罗提渥总理的八点建议，更为就改善东西德之间的关系和创造有利于统一的内部条件问题进行会谈，提出了具体的可行的办法。六月三十日，民主德国政府又决定裁军三万人，把国家人民军限制在九万人的水平上。这样就大大缓和了德国内部的局势，替德国两部分之间的协商谋求统一增加有利的条件。
    现在西德广泛阶层的人士，包括各个资产阶级政党的人士，甚至是阿登纳自己的基督教民主联盟内部一些重要分子，都对阿登纳的阻挠德国统一的政策表示不满，要求加以改变。社会民主党领袖们就曾一再指出，在紧张局势已经缓和的条件下，必须彻底重新修正西德的政策，因为奉行这种政策“就只有牺牲德国的重新统一”。自由民主党领袖戴勒也要求西德政府，应当估计到世界政治已经出现了的变化来改变它的外交政策。最近他并建议就德国的重新统一问题同德意志民主共和国进行谈判。在最近举行的基督教民主联盟第六次联邦代表大会上发生了历史上“空前未有的”分歧。这一切正如西德“社会民主新闻公报”所说的，阿登纳“实际上陷入了完全孤立的境地”。
    正是这种局势的发展，使得执行加深德国分裂和重新武装西德的政策的华盛顿和波恩当局感到惶恐不安。为了支撑阿登纳集团岌岌可危的地位，并阻挡统一德国的有利形势，他们就又一次乞灵于对苏联政策的诬蔑宣传，并急于在德国问题上打上新的死结。美国著名评论家李普曼曾经对阿登纳的访问美国作了很好的说明，他指出：“由于国内对阿登纳博士丧失了信心，所以他到华盛顿来求援。他希望得到证据证明，……美国政府是衷心支持他和他本人政策的”。他并认为华盛顿的这次会谈表明，杜勒斯和阿登纳“采取了一种成为重新统一的不可克服的障碍的态度”，但这种态度是建立在“主观愿望和幻想”之上的东西。
    杜勒斯和阿登纳采取的这种僵硬态度，在英国，法国和其他西欧国家的舆论中，也引起了不良的反应。法国外长比诺在访问美国期间，就公开表明他不同意杜勒斯—阿登纳会谈公报的意见，他说：“要说在俄国解决德国重新统一问题以前不能做任何事情，那‘未免夸大了’德国重新统一的重要性”。据“纽约时报”记者密德尔顿的报道，伦敦权威人士认为“如果阿登纳不懂得，那么美国应当懂得，在统一德国的问题上必须放弃‘冷战’的理论”。
    西德的舆论界和广泛阶层更是猛烈抨击阿登纳访美的结果。“世界报”写道：阿登纳和杜勒斯“仍旧处在冷战的中心………他们逆流而进………结果可能是，他们两人总有一天会陷入比今天所开始出现的孤立状态更加孤立的处境，那时候，他们就要在汹涌的世界政治潮流中灭顶”。显然，华盛顿的支持并未能加强阿登纳的地位。
    解决德国问题的道路并不是狭窄的。但必须采取既符合欧洲和世界和平的利益，又尊重德国人民自己解决自己的问题的民族权利的方针，并正视目前在德国存在着两个不同制度的国家的现实情况，才能走得通。在西德政界人士中认识这一点的人越来越多了。就是在美国资产阶级政治代表中间，也可以听见比较清醒的言论。譬如，有地位的美国参议员弗兰德斯认为，重新武装和重新统一“实际是矛盾的”。他建议成立一个同意解除武装和保持中立的自由的统一的德国。
    杜勒斯已对弗兰德斯的建议公开表示冷淡的态度，这是不足为奇的。有意义的是，杜勒斯以他的“冷战热”使自己陷进了非常不令人羡慕的境地。
