Subjectivism Kills People

	This February, Director Rao of the Silkworm Guidance Station in Cangxi County, Sichuan Province, made an astonishing calculation when assigning silkworm rearing tasks to various districts. Holding his notebook, he gesticulated and said: This year, the county has planted so many mulberry trees, and the mulberry leaf production will increase by several million catties. Pruning, pest control, and fertilization will also increase mulberry leaf production by several million catties. In reality, his calculation was unreliable. For example, the statistics showed that 550,000 mulberry trees were planted in the suburban area, but only 500,000 were actually planted. The small mulberry trees need to be pruned in the first year, generally resulting in little or no income. Although pruning and pest control can increase production, the current technical guidance work has not been fully implemented, and universal pruning and pest control cannot be achieved. Because Director Rao made this muddled calculation, the guidance groups in various districts followed suit, using this calculation to persuade the masses to order more silkworm eggs and raise more silkworms blindly. For example, the suburban area could only raise 1,700 sheets of silkworm eggs based on the existing mulberry leaves, but the Silkworm Guidance Station insisted on allocating 1,952 sheets. As a result, the silkworm guidance group had no choice but to forcibly assign the task downwards. When silkworm farmer Li Feng'en worried that there would not be enough mulberry leaves, the comrades of the silkworm guidance group immediately criticized him for having "conservative thinking" and "passive thinking." The masses, fearing being labeled as backward, dared not object anymore.
	The concerns of the masses were correct. Now, the leaf shortage in various districts is quite serious. The suburban area alone is short of more than 40,000 catties of leaves. Some cooperatives had no choice but to dump the nearly mature silkworms into latrines, while others went to grab mulberry leaves. Xie Chengying, a technician from the Jiankang Cooperative, cried for three days and nights without eating because of the silkworms. The masses, unable to find mulberry leaves, ran around everywhere to buy them, some going to Guangyuan, others to Langzhong, traveling hundreds of miles back and forth, only to return home hungry and empty-handed. At this time, the silkworm guidance cadres hid everywhere, afraid to meet the masses.

    主观主义害死人
    今年二月四川省苍溪县蚕桑指导站饶站长，在给各区布置养蚕任务时，算了一笔惊人的大账。他拿着笔记本指手划脚地说：今年全县栽了多少桑树，要增加桑叶几百万斤，修枝、除虫、施肥又要增产桑叶几百万斤。实际上他的这笔大账是不可靠的，如统计城郊区栽桑树五十五万棵，实际只栽了五十万棵，栽的小桑树第一年要剪条，一般是没收入，或收入很少的。虽然修枝除虫能增产，但是现在的技术指导工作还没有全面贯彻，不能做到普遍的修枝除虫。由于饶站长算了这笔糊涂账，各区的指导组也依样画葫芦，用这笔账去打通群众的思想，盲目地叫群众多订蚕种，多养蚕。如城郊区按现有桑叶计算只能养蚕种1，700张，可是蚕桑指导站硬要分配1，952张，于是蚕桑指导组就不得不把分配的任务硬往下派。蚕农李凤恩怕以后桑叶不够吃，蚕桑指导组的同志就当场批评他是“保守思想”“消极思想”，群众怕带落后帽子，就再也不敢反对了。
    群众的担心是正确的。现在各区缺叶相当严重，光城郊区就缺叶四万多斤，有的社不得已就把快要成熟的蚕往茅坑里倒，有的社就去抢桑叶。健康社技术员谢成英守着蚕哭了三天三夜连饭都没吃。群众找不到桑叶，就东奔西跑到处去买，有的上广元，有的到阆中，来回数百余里，结果挨饥受饿，空手回家。在这个时候，蚕桑指导干部却到处隐藏，不敢和群众见面了。
