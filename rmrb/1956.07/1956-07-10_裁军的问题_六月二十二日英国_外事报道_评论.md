"The Question of Disarmament"
Commentary from the British "Foreign Affairs Report" on June 22nd

Next year, people will need to pay increasing attention to the economic problems of disarmament: (1) if international relations continue to ease; (2) if, as a result, following the current trend of manpower reductions in the three largest countries, Britain, Russia, and the United States, there is a subsequent reduction in arms production. When examining the situation in these three countries, as far as the research institute knows, it is difficult not to conclude that a sudden decision to disarm would have a less severe impact on Russia than on Britain, and a less severe impact on Britain than on the United States. The effects of rapid disarmament would likely be as follows:

(1) In Russia, labor and industrial capacity could be quickly redirected to other areas of production after minor adjustments. This would mean that there would likely be more industrial products available for the Soviet Union's trade activities in non-Communist countries, with potentially more cars, machine tools, and aircraft available for export. More people and materials could be used to develop the entire Eastern Bloc. Scientists leaving military factories would likely be of considerable importance to the peaceful development of atomic energy and electronics in Russia.

(2) The American economy would need some time to recover from the impact of rapid disarmament. The recession of 1954 was mainly due to the reduction in defense spending after the Korean War. A sudden, larger-scale reduction could not but produce effects that would cause a depression—more due to the reduction in public spending in industry than due to a surplus of labor.

Even under favorable conditions, some kind of recession would occur, resulting in the following effects: certain industries—especially aircraft, shipbuilding, and parts of the electronics industry—would be severely hit. As a result of the recession, the United States might make greater efforts in exports. Increasing aid to underdeveloped countries so that they can import more goods would help mitigate the impact of the American export drive on European exporters, but the possibility of such aid is small, because it is more difficult to "sell" aid to Congress during a period of easing international tensions.

(3) In Britain, the domestic impact would generally be positive. It would ease the labor market and the supply of steel, machinery, and other goods. The forces of domestic expansion or those creating inflation in Britain are so strong that the government should have no difficulty preventing a general recession. Some long-overdue public investment projects—such as highway construction plans—could be initiated. The aircraft industry, and perhaps some vehicle, arms, and electronics companies, would be affected, but there should not be as widespread a recession as in the United States.

The main economic danger comes from outside. If a recession occurs in the United States, it would affect Britain's and the Sterling Area's dollar earnings. If British domestic policy remains expansionary while recessions occur in the United States and other disarming countries, payment difficulties could become severe.

This preliminary study is certainly not exhaustive. It definitely shows that Russia would reap the greatest benefits from rapid disarmament in the short term (if other countries also disarm). From the American point of view—and to a lesser extent from the British point of view—the short-term problems caused by disarmament conducted bit by bit would be less than those caused by signing a general disarmament agreement.

    “裁军的问题”
    六月二十二日英国“外事报道”评论
    明年人们对裁军的经济问题将需要给予越来越大的注意：（一）如果国际关系继续缓和；（二）如果因此继目前三个最大的国家英国、俄国和美国裁减人力的趋势之后，接着减少军备生产的话。在研究所知道的三国的情况的时候，很难不得出这样的结论：要是突然决定裁军，对俄国的影响不及对英国的影响严重，对英国的影响又不及对美国的影响严重。迅速裁军的影响大概如下：
    （一）在俄国，劳动力和工业能力在经过小调整后会很快用于其它方面的生产。这会意味着：大概会有更多的工业产品可以用于苏联在非共产党国家方面的贸易活动，可能有更多的汽车、工作母机和飞机可以出口；可以有更多的人和物资用来发展整个东方集团；离开军事工厂的科学家大概会对于原子能和电子学在俄国的和平发展有相当大的重要意义。
    （二）美国经济将需要一些时间来从迅速裁军的影响中恢复过来。1954年的不景气主要是由于朝鲜战争以后的防御开支削减。突然的规模更大的裁减不能不产生会引起萧条的影响——更多的是由于工业中公共开支的削减而不是由于多余了人力。
    即便在有利的条件下，某种衰退也会发生，而产生下列的影响：某些工业——特别是飞机、造船和某些部分的电子工业——将会受到严重的打击；由于衰退的结果，美国可能在出口方面作更大的努力。增加对不发达国家的援助，使它们能够进口较多的东西，会有助于缓和美国出口运动对欧洲出口商人的影响，但是这种援助的可能性是微小的，因为在国际局势缓和的时期要向国会“兜售”援助是比较困难的。
    （三）在英国，国内的影响总的来说会是良好的，它会缓和劳动力市场和钢、机器及其他货物的供应。英国国内扩展的力量或者造成通货膨胀的力量是那么强大，政府应当不难防止总的衰退。有些早就应该进行的公共投资计划——例如修筑公路的计划——可以开始进行。飞机工业，也许还有某些车辆、军火和电子公司会受到打击，但是，应当不会有像美国那么普遍的衰退。
    主要的经济上的危险来自外面。如果美国发生衰退，就会影响英国和英镑区的美元收入。如果在美国和其他裁军的国家发生衰退的时候英国的国内政策保持扩充，支付的困难就可能变得很严重。
    这个初步的研究当然不是很充分的。它肯定地表明，俄国会在短期内从迅速裁军中收获最大（如果其他国家也裁军的话）。从美国的观点看——在较小的程度上从英国的观点看——，一点一滴地进行裁军所引起的短时期内的问题会比签订总的裁军协定所引起的来得少。
