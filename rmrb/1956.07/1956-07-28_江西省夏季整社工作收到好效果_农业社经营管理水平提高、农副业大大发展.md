This newspaper Nanchang, 27th dispatch: Jiangxi Province's summer rectification of communes work is nearing completion. Among them, the rectification work in the Gannan District and Ji'an Prefecture has basically ended. Generally, good results have been achieved in the summer rectification in various places. Through rectification, the vast majority of communes conscientiously implemented the policy of "running communes diligently and frugally," promoting the development of production.

After the rectification, the diversified operations of agricultural cooperatives have greatly developed, and the members are more actively participating in labor production. Ji'an Prefecture planted 24,203 mu of improved cotton during the rectification phase, exceeding the planting plan by 101%. They also carried out one to two rounds of thinning, weeding, and topdressing. The growth of sideline production was even more significant after the rectification. In Yongxiu, Hukou, and four other counties in Jiujiang Prefecture, 391 cooperatives extracted more than 2,600 laborers to engage in sideline occupations, earning an income of 40,300 yuan in less than a month. In addition to expanding production, many cooperatives also reduced expenses accordingly to ensure increased income for the members.

After rectification, agricultural cooperatives also improved their management level, and most cooperatives revised their plans in line with the actual situation during the rectification process. After detailed accounting, 58 out of 134 cooperatives in Leping County lowered their production targets, and 14 cooperatives whose original targets were relatively conservative slightly increased them after tapping their potential. The members were very satisfied. In Jiujiang Prefecture, 21 advanced cooperatives and 142 elementary cooperatives had disorganized labor organizations. After rectification, the implementation of labor quotas and remuneration based on labor changed the chaotic situation. Most cooperatives also rectified the internal financial work, so that the cooperatives gradually moved onto the track of planned management. Through rectification, the awareness of the members has also been raised, and the organization of the cooperatives has been purified. Many cooperatives have purged hidden counter-revolutionaries and dealt with cases of cadre corruption.

During the rectification process, adjustments were generally made to the improper handling of mountains, forests, water conservancy, and other cash crops left over from the establishment of the cooperatives in various places. The Xingxing Cooperative in Shangrao County originally included the members' rapeseed into the cooperative without compensation, which aroused dissatisfaction among the members. This time, it was re-evaluated and the members were given certain remuneration, which pleased everyone.

During the rectification, some places blindly carried out the rectification without investigation or analysis. For example, in Wanggang Township, Nanfeng County, the production targets of all 13 cooperatives were lowered, which affected the production enthusiasm of the members. Some places are now conducting a review to solve new problems arising from the rectification.

    江西省夏季整社工作收到好效果
    农业社经营管理水平提高、农副业大大发展
    本报南昌27日电　江西省各地夏季整社工作将近结束。其中赣南区、吉安专区的整社工作目前已基本结束。各地在夏季整社中，一般都收到了良好的效果。绝大多数社通过整顿，认真地贯彻了“勤俭办社”的方针，促进了生产的发展。
    整社后，农业社的多种经营大大发展了，社员更积极地参加劳动生产。吉安全区在整社阶段播种了良棉24，203亩，超额101％完成了播种计划，并进行了一至二次间苗锄草和追肥工作，副业生产在整社后增长更为显著。九江专区的永修、湖口等六个县391个社抽出二千六百多个劳动力搞副业，不到一个月即得到了四万零三百元的收入。除了扩大生产以外，许多社还相应地缩减了开支，以保证社员增加收入。
    农业社经过整顿，还提高了经营管理水平，多数社在整顿中切合实际情况修订了计划。乐平县134个社经过具体算账以后，有五十八个社降低了生产指标，有十四个社原来指标比较保守，经过挖掘潜力后，稍有提高，社员都很满意。九江专区有二十一个高级社和142个初级社，劳动组织涣散，整社后，推行了劳动定额和按劳取酬制，改变了混乱现象。多数社还对社内财务工作进行了整顿，使合作社逐步走上计划管理的轨道。通过整社，还提高了社员的觉悟，纯洁了社的组织。许多社清洗了隐藏的反革命分子；对干部贪污事件也作了处理。
    在整社中，各地对建社时遗留下来的对山林、水利和其他经济作物处理不当之处，一般都作了调整。上饶县星星社原来将社员的油菜无代价入社，引起了社员的不满，这次重新估价，给社员一定报酬，社员皆大欢喜。
    在整社时，有的地方还有既不调查、又不分析、盲目进行整社的情况。如南丰县王岗乡十三个社生产指标全部降低，影响了社员的生产积极性。现在有些地方正在进行复查工作，以便解决整社中产生的新问题。
