On the eve of "July 1st," the General Branch Committee of the Communist Party of China in Huayuantuo Township, Gaiping County, Liaoning Province, at a meeting to discuss accepting new party members, once again refused a person who had actively requested to join the Party since 1954, and who had been loyal to the Party's cause for a long time and was willing to fight for communism for the rest of her life, from the door of the Communist Party, on the grounds that "she is old and there is not much future in joining the Party." This person is Chen Guiqiu, a 56-year-old female production team leader of the Taiyangsheng Agricultural Production Cooperative in this township.

The reason why Chen Guiqiu has not been accepted into the Party is not clear to her, and even the cadres of the township's General Branch in charge of Party work cannot give a truly tenable reason. Fu Songshan, the secretary of the township's General Branch Committee of the Communist Party of China, told reporters that Chen Guiqiu, who was impoverished in the old society, has greatly improved her class consciousness after several political movements since liberation. After the outbreak of the war of aggression against Korea by American imperialism in 1950, she sent her only son to join the Chinese People's Volunteers. After her son joined the army, she should have enjoyed the treatment of a military family member according to her family's production situation, but she never asked the government and the masses to give her any preferential treatment. She often said, my son went to resist America and aid Korea, to defend the motherland, for everyone, and for ourselves. As long as I can work for a day, I will never trouble everyone. Therefore, she has won the title of Model Military Family Member of Gaiping County four times. In 1954, when Guoyuan Village (where Chen Guiqiu is located) was just beginning to establish the Huohong Elementary Agricultural Production Cooperative, Chen Guiqiu took the lead in responding to the Party's call, joined the cooperative, and was elected by the masses as a member of the cooperative's management committee and a female production team leader. In the two years of running the elementary cooperative in 1954 and 1955, in order to consolidate and develop the cooperative and strive to increase the income of the members, she always took the lead in everything, never fearing difficulties and caring about personal interests. In 1955, the counter-revolutionary element Liu Xueshi, who had infiltrated the cooperative, sabotaged the cooperative in an attempt to bring it down. Chen Guiqiu immediately reported the situation to the Party organization and helped the government to promptly crack the case and consolidate the cooperative.

At the beginning of this year, after the merger of Huohong Cooperative and neighboring cooperatives into an advanced cooperative, the cooperative lacked funds. Chen Guiqiu took the lead and invested 400 yuan in the cooperative at one time. In production, she is also more active than in the past. For example, recently when transplanting rice seedlings, some members were unwilling to do it because the water was cold. Chen Guiqiu took the initiative to lead the way in transplanting rice seedlings. Under her influence, more than 20 members immediately went into the water, ensuring the smooth progress of the rice transplanting work. Because Chen Guiqiu can actively and diligently work in various tasks without fear of hardship, she has been rated as a first-class labor model in each of the two model evaluations in the cooperative since the beginning of spring. Chen Guiqiu's consistent exemplary actions over the years have earned her a high reputation among the masses. As long as people mention Aunt Guo (her husband's surname is Guo, and people call her Aunt Guo), no one says she is not good. Aunt Guo is also concerned about the suffering and interests of the members in daily life. The female members of the production team she leads receive good care during menstruation and pregnancy. Once, the old soldier's family member Gao Dianliang was sick and no one took care of him. She not only personally served him for three or four days, but also asked her daughter-in-law to often cook medicine for him.

Fu Songshan said: Guo Dama's performance and her long-standing desire to join the Party shows that she has a high level of class consciousness and determination to strive for the cause of communism. According to the Party Constitution, her application should have been accepted and she should have been admitted to the Party long ago. Although all the Party members of the branch in the production team where Chen Guiqiu is located agreed to accept her as a probationary member, most of the members of the General Branch Committee ideologically believed that she was too old and that there was not much future in joining the Party, so it could not be passed, let alone consciously cultivated and helped her.

On June 28, the reporter visited Chen Guiqiu. After she introduced to me why she wanted to join the Party and why she so urgently hoped to have her wish resolved, she humbly said: "I still have some shortcomings now, and I have not studied well enough. I should overcome these shortcomings as soon as possible in the future and strive hard!"

    拒绝老人入党是不对的
    新华社记者　杨绍山
      “七一”前夕，中共辽宁省盖平县花园坨乡总支委员会在一次讨论接收新党员入党的会上，又一次以“年龄老了，入党也没有多大前途”为理由，把一个从1954年就积极要求入党，并且长期忠实于党的事业，愿意终身为共产主义奋斗的人，拒绝于共产党的大门之外。这个人就是这个乡太阳升农业生产合作社五十六岁的妇女生产队长陈桂秋。
    陈桂秋究竟为什么没有被接收入党的原因，不但她自己不大清楚，就连乡总支负责党的工作的干部，也说不出个真正站得住脚的理由来。这个乡的中共总支委员会书记傅松山向记者介绍说：在旧社会清贫如洗的陈桂秋，解放后几年来经过各种政治运动，阶级觉悟已经有了很大提高。1950年美帝国主义侵略朝鲜战争爆发以后，她把自己的独生子送去参加了中国人民志愿军。儿子参军走后，根据她家的生产情况，理应享受军属待遇，但她从来不要求政府和群众给她什么优待。她常说，我儿子去抗美援朝，保卫祖国，为了大家，也是为了我们自己，我能够干一天，就决不麻烦大家。因此，她曾四次荣获盖平县的一等军属模范称号。1954年果园村（陈桂秋所在村）刚刚开始建立火红初级农业生产合作社时，陈桂秋便首先带头响应党的号召，参加了合作社，并被群众选为社的管理委员会委员和妇女生产队长。在1954和1955两年办初级社当中，她为了巩固、发展合作社和争取让社员都能增加收入，事事都走在前头，从不害怕困难和计较个人利益。1955年，混进社里的反革命分子刘学诗对合作社进行破坏，企图搞垮社。陈桂秋马上就向党组织反映了情况，帮助政府及时地破获了这个案件，巩固了合作社。
    今年年初，火红社和邻近社合并转成高级社以后，社内缺少办社资金，陈桂秋带头一次就向社里投资四百元。在生产上，她也比过去更加积极了。例如最近水稻插秧时，因为水凉，有的社员就不大愿意干。陈桂秋便主动带头插秧，在她的影响下，立刻就有二十多名社员下水，保证了水稻插秧工作顺利进行。由于陈桂秋在各项工作中都能不避辛苦地积极肯干，入春以来社内两次评模，每次她都被评上了一等劳动模范。陈桂秋几年来始终一贯的模范行动，在群众中享有很高的威信。只要人们一提起郭大娘（她丈夫姓郭，人们都称她为郭大娘），没有一个不说她是好样的。郭大娘在日常也很关心社员的疾苦和利益。她领导的生产队，妇女社员来月经和怀孕期间，都得到很好的照顾。有一次，军属高殿良老头有病没有人照看，她不但亲自侍候了三、四天，而且还让她儿媳经常给熬药。
    傅松山说：就郭大娘的这些表现和她几年来迫切要求入党的愿望，说明了她有着很高的阶级觉悟和为共产主义事业而奋斗的决心，按照党章规定，理应早就该接收她的申请，吸收她入党。虽然陈桂秋所在生产队的分支部全体党员都同意接收她为候补党员，但是总支委员会的多数委员在思想上认为她年纪老了，入党没有多大前途，得不到通过，更谈不到有意识地培养和帮助她了。
    六月二十八日，记者访问了陈桂秋。她在向我介绍了她为什么要求入党，以及为什么这样迫切希望得到解决的愿望以后，谦虚地说：“我现在还有些缺点，学习的还不够好，今后还应该尽快地克服这些缺点，努力争取啊！”
