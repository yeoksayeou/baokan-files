	Are They Cadres or Lords?
	Ding San
	The July 14th "Workers' Daily" on its third page exposed the abominable phenomenon of certain personnel looking down upon and insulting primary school teachers, and published a cartoon with the title: Is it a Teacher or a Cook? Judging from the text and the content of the cartoon, these people are treating teachers as more than just cooks! They simply see themselves as lords, treating teachers as their servants.
	It is said that the reason they despise and insult primary school teachers is that the primary school teacher ranks are "too complex." This is a paper shield. No matter how "complex" the vast primary school teacher ranks may be, an upright leader should, according to the policies of the Party and the government, treat them fairly and realistically: commend those who should be commended, criticize those who should be criticized, and dismiss those who should be dismissed. What reason is there to adopt a lordly and crude attitude towards primary school teachers indiscriminately? Frankly speaking, this kind of crude behavior is proof of how "complex" the thinking of these personnel themselves is, proving that there are lordly elements in their minds!
	This is not the first time we have heard calls for justice regarding the unfair treatment of primary school teachers. It is clear that this is not an isolated phenomenon, and it is time to arouse people's serious attention. Those "complex" theorists holding paper shields should also calmly use the mirror of thought to reflect on their own spiritual outlook: to see whether they are cadres of the new society or lords of the old society!

    是干部还是老爷？
    丁三
    七月十四日“工人日报”第三版揭发了某些人员轻视、侮辱小学教师的恶劣现象，并发表了一幅漫画，画的标题是：是教师还是厨师？从文字和漫画的内容看来，这些人员岂只把教师看作厨师！他们简直以老爷自居，把教师看作自己的仆人了。
    据说他们所以轻视、侮辱小学教师的原因，是小学教师队伍“太复杂”。这是纸糊的盾牌。不管庞大的小学教师队伍怎样“复杂”，一个正直的领导人员应该根据党和政府的政策，实事求是地分别对待：该表扬的表扬，该批评的批评，该撤职的撤职，有什么理由可以不分皂白地对小学教师采取老爷式的粗暴态度？老实说，这种粗暴行为正是那些人员本身思想意识“太复杂”的反证，证明他们的头脑里，竟有老爷思想的成分在！
    我们听到小学教师遭受不公平待遇的呼声，这不是第一次。可见这并不是个别的现象，是应该唤起人们严重注意的时候了。那些手拿纸糊盾牌的“复杂”论者，也应该冷静地用思想的镜子来照照自己的精神面貌：看它到底是新社会的干部还是旧社会的老爷！
