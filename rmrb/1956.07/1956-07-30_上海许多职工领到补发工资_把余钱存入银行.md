Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, July 27th: Many workers in Shanghai have deposited their surplus money in banks after receiving back pay for the wage increases from April to July.

Wage reform is currently underway in Shanghai. Municipal-level government agencies, people's organizations, and enterprises such as insurance companies under the jurisdiction of the Municipal People's Committee have already paid the wage difference from April to July to 70,000 employees before July 25th, according to the new standards of the wage reform. After 161 workers at the Shanghai Textile Industry Bureau received their back pay, 104 of them deposited their surplus money into banks, with the amount stored accounting for over 48% of the total back pay. Yuan Chuanrong, a civil servant at the bureau who had never deposited money in a bank before, also opened a new current deposit account with prize savings.

Due to the impact of wage reform, the savings deposits balance in Shanghai's banks increased by 9,010,000 yuan in the first 25 days of July, a rate of growth exceeding any previous month. According to general patterns, bank savings increase less in the latter half of the month, but from July 20th to 25th, the savings deposit balance of the Shanghai Branch of the People's Bank of China increased by more than 300,000 yuan per day. The deposits increased during these five business days exceeded the growth in the entire first quarter of this year.

Since the beginning of this year, due to rapid production growth and an increase in the number of employed people, monthly bank savings deposits have increased in a straight line. As of July 25th, the city's bank savings deposit balance had increased by 27,730,000 yuan compared to the end of last year. Calculated by the city's population, each Shanghai citizen has an average of over 60 yuan deposited in the bank, and on average, one out of every three people has savings in the bank.

    上海许多职工领到补发工资
    把余钱存入银行
    新华社上海27日电　上海市许多职工在补领到四月到七月增发的工资以后，把余钱存进了银行。
    上海市的工资改革目前正在进行，市人民委员会所属市区机关、人民团体以及保险公司等企业单位，已经在七月二十五日前按工资改革的新标准向七万职工补发了四月到七月的工资差额。上海市纺织工业局一百六十一个职工补领到工资以后，有一百零四人把余钱存进了银行，储存金额占补发工资总数的48％以上。这个局的公务员袁传荣从来没有在银行存钱，这次也新开了一个活期有奖储蓄存单。
    由于工资改革的影响，七月份前二十五天内，上海市的银行储蓄存款余额增加了九百零一万元，增长的速度超过了以往任何一个月。按照一般规律，每月下旬银行储蓄增加较少，但在七月二十日到二十五日间，中国人民银行上海分行的储蓄存款余额每天增加三十多万元，这期间五个营业日所增加的存款，比今年第一季度的增长数还要多。
    今年以来，由于生产迅速增长和就业人数扩大，银行每月的储蓄存款成直线上升。到七月二十五日止，全市银行储蓄存款余额比去年年底增加了二千七百七十三万元。如果按全市人口计算，平均每个上海市民在银行存有六十多元，平均不到三个人中就有一个人在银行储蓄。
