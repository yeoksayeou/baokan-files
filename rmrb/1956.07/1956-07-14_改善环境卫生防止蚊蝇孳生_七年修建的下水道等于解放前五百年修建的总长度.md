    Improve Environmental Sanitation to Prevent Mosquito and Fly Breeding
    Sewers Built in Seven Years Equal the Total Length Built in the Five Hundred Years Before Liberation
    (Our newspaper reports) In the past, during the rainy season in July, many streets in the capital often turned into "ink boxes" after rain. Now, the serious water accumulation problems on hundreds of streets in the city have been resolved. Tricycle workers often say to passengers: "These days, the roads are much easier to travel after rain!"
    Since liberation, the People's Government has done a lot of work in eliminating rainwater and sewage. The total length of newly built sewage pipes from 1949 to 1955 is equal to the total length of sewers built in the five hundred years before liberation. By the end of June this year, the investment in water supply and drainage has completed 63.6% of the total investment for this year.
    Beijing originally had a relatively complete sewer system five hundred years ago, but due to disrepair over the generations, most of it was silted up and collapsed. At the beginning of liberation, the usable sewer length was only twenty kilometers. On the mess left by the Kuomintang, the People's Government has dredged and repaired the old 287 kilometers of sewers in the past seven years, and built 289 kilometers of new sewers in key construction areas such as the western and eastern suburbs and in residential areas for the working people. Among them, sixty-two kilometers are dedicated sewage sewers, which the city has never had before.
    The last stinking open ditch in the city, from Shichahai to Donghuamen—the Imperial River—was recently rebuilt into a sewer. From then on, stinking open ditches have completely disappeared in the city.
    The People's Government has also vigorously repaired and dredged rivers and lakes. In the past seven years, a total of 4.38 million cubic meters of earth and stone have been excavated from rivers and lakes, and 700,000 square meters of water surface have been added. The turbid water of Beihai, Zhongnanhai, Shichahai, and Jishuitan has turned into clear water, and reed ponds have become parks. When the people of the capital go to the beautifully scenic Taoranting, Zizhuyuan, Longtan, and Jinyuchi parks on Sundays, who remembers that this used to be a stinking pool and reed pond!
    At the beginning of this year, a 19-kilometer-long Yongding River water diversion channel was built. In addition to supplying water for factories and the daily life of citizens, the water introduced by this channel can also flush riverbeds and supply fresh water to Beihai, Shichahai, and Kunming Lake, improving the people's environmental sanitation.
    Now, when you stroll through the streets of Beijing, you will see sewer construction projects everywhere. A main sewage pipe is being built in the moat of the Qian San Men (front three gates), which will divert the sewage discharged from the inner city before the Yongding River water is introduced. To cooperate with key construction projects, a sewage pipe more than five kilometers long is being built on the south and north streets of Yuetan. In Heishanhu, Taijichang, Wenjin Street, Jingshan Front Street… large sewer pipes are being laid one after another. These pipes will divert sewage and rainwater like the great arteries of blood vessels. (Xing Ke)

### 改善环境卫生防止蚊蝇孳生  七年修建的下水道等于解放前五百年修建的总长度

    改善环境卫生防止蚊蝇孳生
    七年修建的下水道等于解放前五百年修建的总长度
    本报讯　从前在七月多雨的季节里，首都城内很多街道在雨后常常变成“墨盒子”。现在城内数百处街道的严重积水问题已经得到解决。三轮车工人常对乘客说：“这会儿，下过雨后路可好走多了！”
    解放后，人民政府在排除雨水和污水方面做了许多工作。1949年到1955年的七年中，新建下水管道总长度，已等于解放前五百多年修建下水道的总长度。今年六月底对上下水道的投资已完成今年投资总额的63.6％。
    北京在五百年前本来就有一个较完整的下水道系统，但由于历代失修，已经大部淤塞、坍塌，到解放初能用的下水道长度只有二十公里。人民政府在国民党遗留的乱摊子上，七年来掏挖、修整了旧有的287公里下水道，并在西郊、东郊等各处的重点建设区及劳动人民居住区新建下水道289公里，其中有六十二公里是本市从来没有过的专排污水的下水道。
    城内从什刹海到东华门的最后一条臭明沟——御河，不久前已经改建成为下水道。从此，城内臭明沟就全部绝迹了。
    人民政府还大力整修疏浚了河湖。七年来开挖河湖土方共438万公方，增辟水面七十万平方公尺。北海、中南海、什刹海和积水潭的浊水变成了清水，苇塘变成了公园。首都人民星期天去风景优美的陶然亭、紫竹院、龙潭、金鱼池游览时，谁还记得从前这里就是臭水坑和苇塘呢！
    今年年初又兴建了全长达十九公里的永定河引水渠道。这条渠道引进的水除供工厂和市民生活用水外，还可以冲刷河槽，供应北海、什刹海、昆明湖的活水，改善人民的环境卫生。
    现在，当你漫步在北京街道，随时都会看到兴建下水道的工程。前三门护城河正在修建一条排污水的干管，它将在引永定河水前把内城排出的污水引走。为配合重点建设，在月坛南、北街，正修建五公里多长的污水管。在黑山扈、台基厂、文津街、景山前街……敷设下一根根粗大的下水道管。这些管道将像血管大动脉一样把污水和雨水引走。　（邢　克）
