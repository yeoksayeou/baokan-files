    Welcoming the Enrollment of Institutions of Higher Education
    Young Applicants Bury Themselves in Preparation

    (Reported by our newspaper) The date for this year's college entrance exams is drawing near, and preparing for the exams has become a major part of the lives of young people in the capital who are applying to colleges and universities. In recent days, it has become common to see young people holding books and preparing for exams in the Beijing Library, in parks, and even on streetcars.

    More than 3,000 young people from society, government workers, demobilized soldiers, and employees of factories and enterprises who are taking high school courses at the Beijing Radio Correspondence School are about to finish their studies. They have systematically reviewed high school courses in about three months. The learning has been very intense, and many students have lost weight from fatigue, but their spirits are high and their academic progress is rapid, with 70% of them passing the mid-term exams. Many students have strengthened their confidence in further education after the tutoring.

    报考青年埋头备课
    本报讯　今年高等学校招生考试的日期一天天临近了，准备应试已经成为目前首都报考高等学校的青年生活中的一件大事情。最近几天来，在北京图书馆和各公园里，甚至在电车上，常常会看见抱着书本准备考试的青年。
    三千多名在北京广播函授学校补习高中课程的社会青年、机关工作人员、复员军人和工厂企业的职工就要结束学习。他们在三个月左右的时间内，有系统地复习了高中课程。学习非常紧张，很多学员都累瘦了，但精神饱满，学业进步很快，70％的人在期中测验都能及格。很多学员经过补习以后，加强了升学的信心。
