Xinhua News Agency, Manila, 26th: According to the "Manila Chronicle", the chairman of the Philippine House Foreign Affairs Committee, Miguel Cuenco, said on July 20th that because the US bases in the Philippines have a 99-year lease, the Philippines has been deprived of the freedom of action necessary in many aspects of exercising sovereignty.

In a formal statement to the press, he pointed out that the US military bases have brought these evils: prostitution, gambling, alcoholism and other crimes have increased in the towns around these bases; the income of the municipal authorities within the base or reservation is deprived; and the means of livelihood of many residents within or near the base are deprived.

Cuenco also condemned the "mysterious and secretive atmosphere" of the current negotiations on expanding US military bases in the Philippines.

Cuenco also said that the US military authorities have selected Mactan Island near Cebu, Laoag in Northern Ilocos Province, and some towns in Zambales, Bataan, Zambales, and Leyte as possible sites for new bases. The US military authorities plan to establish radar equipment in Laoag, Northern Ilocos Province. The US military authorities may later establish bases in the area because it is adjacent to the China Sea.

    菲众议院外委会主席指责
    美军事基地给菲律宾带来罪恶
    据新华社26日讯　马尼拉消息：据“马尼拉纪事报”报道，菲律宾众议院外交委员会主席米格尔·库恩柯在七月二十日说，由于美国在菲律宾的基地具有九十九年租借期，菲律宾已经被剥夺了在行使主权的许多方面所必需的行动自由。
    他在向报界发表的一篇正式声明中指出，美国军事基地带来了这些罪恶：这些基地周围的市镇里娼妓、赌博、酗酒和其他罪行增加；基地或保留地范围以内的市镇当局的收入被剥夺；基地以内或基地附近的许多居民的谋生手段被剥夺。
    库恩柯还谴责目前就扩大美国在菲律宾的军事基地问题所进行的谈判的“神秘和秘密气氛”。
    库恩柯还说，美国军事当局已经选定宿务附近的目丹岛、北依罗戈省的老沃和三描礼示、巴丹、三描和礼智的一些市镇作为新基地的可能的地点。美国军事当局计划在北依罗戈省的老沃建立雷达设备。美国军事当局以后还可能在该地区建立基地，因为它邻近中国海。
