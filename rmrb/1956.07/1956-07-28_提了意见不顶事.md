Title: Offering Opinions Doesn't Help

To the Editor:

    The Party organizational life in our institution – the head office of the Bank of Communications – is not active. Everyone has long expressed opinions about this lifeless, listless, and weak organizational life, but it has not been resolved. Although there are many reasons why the Party organizational life is not active, the main reason is the lack of criticism and self-criticism. For example, everyone has many opinions on the leadership style and lifestyle of a few leading cadres, but they are unwilling or dare not raise them. For example, Comrade Wang Geng, director of the Accounting Department, and Comrade Song Yaoxian, deputy director of the Personnel Department, both have some opinions about Manager Zhang, and they have also raised them, but these issues have not been seriously dealt with. Once, a Party member raised the following opinion to the branch: Manager Zhang has a dormitory outside, enough for his whole family to live in, so he should not occupy three office rooms in the institution as a dormitory. The branch secretary not only did not seriously deal with this issue, but criticized the Party member, saying: Party members should not care about these small matters of life. Since the branch secretary believes this is a "small matter of life," this issue naturally had to be left unresolved. Later, I learned that the branch secretary also occupied office rooms (he also had a dormitory outside). This is truly a case of "if you are not upright yourself, how can you rectify others?" Manager Zhang also has some improper behavior in his relationships with women. Last September, I reported this matter to the Party organization. The branch secretary immediately told Manager Zhang exactly what I had reported, and specifically declared to him that this was an opinion raised by Lin Wei, not the opinion of the branch. After hearing this, Manager Zhang summoned me and questioned me sternly: "Lin Wei, what kind of private activities have you been up to these days?" Good heavens, I really don't know what he meant by that. I am a Communist Party member. When I see a Party member with a tumor in their thinking, I should ask the branch to help this Party member remove this tumor. This is my right and my obligation. How can it be called "private activity?" This matter has been dragging on until now without being properly dealt with.

    Editor, I now urgently request (no, this is the common request of the vast majority of Party members in our branch) that the higher Party committee come soon to help us revitalize Party life so that every Party member can fully exert their enthusiasm. Lin Wei

    提了意见不顶事编辑同志：
    我们机关——交通银行总行的党组织的生活是不活跃的，大家对这种死气沉沉的涣散无力的组织生活，早就提出过意见，但一直没有得到解决。党组织生活不活跃的原因虽然很多，但主要是批评和自我批评不开展。比如大家对少数领导干部的领导作风和生活方式都有不少意见，但是都不愿或不敢提出来。如会计处处长王更同志和人事处副处长宋耀先同志，都对张经理有些意见，也都提了出来，但是这些问题却没有得到认真的处理。曾经有个党员向支部提出这样的意见：张经理在外面有宿舍，足够全家住用，就不该再占用三间机关办公用房作宿舍。支部书记不但没有严肃地处理这个问题，反而批评这个党员说：党员不应当计较这些生活小事。既然支部书记认为这是“生活小事”，这问题自然就只好不了了之。后来才知道，原来支部书记同样占用了办公用房（他外面也有宿舍），这真是“己不正，焉能正人”。张经理在男女关系上还有一些不正当的行为。去年九月间，我向党组织揭发了这件事。支部书记却立即把我所揭发的事情原原本本的告诉了张经理，还特别向他声明这是林威提的意见，不是支部的意见。张经理听到这话之后，就把我找了去，声色俱厉地质问我：“林威，你这些天又在搞什么私下活动？”我的天，我真不知道他这句话是什么意思。我是一个共产党员，当我看到一个党员思想上长了毒瘤，就应当要求支部帮助这个党员把这个毒瘤割掉，这是我的权利，也是我的义务，怎么能叫做“私下活动”呢？这件事情一直拖到现在还没有得到正确的处理。
    编辑同志，我现在迫切地要求（不，这是我们支部绝大多数党员的共同要求）上级党委能早些来帮助我们把党的生活活跃起来，使每个党员都能够充分发挥自己的积极性。　林威
