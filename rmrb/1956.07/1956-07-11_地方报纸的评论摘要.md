Local Newspaper Review Summary

Strive for a Bumper Autumn Harvest with All Our Might

    The Henan Daily published an editorial on the 7th of this month titled "Strive for a Bumper Autumn Harvest with All Our Might." The editorial pointed out that this year's wheat crop was hit by disasters, directly increasing the task of increasing agricultural production in the autumn; and this year's autumn field management work, due to the tense flood prevention and disaster relief work, excessive rainfall, and insufficient fertilizer, has increased many difficulties. At present, the central task in production is to cultivate, weed, and fertilize, while also doing a good job in the cultivation and management of cotton, corn, and tobacco.

    In order to do this work well, all localities must first summarize the summer harvest and planting work, carry out mass field inspections, rationally arrange various farm tasks, and formulate plans for increasing autumn agricultural production. This can enhance farmers' confidence in striving for a bumper autumn harvest, and can also break the paralysis of complacency, discover and solve the serious problems existing in autumn field management.

    The labor management methods of many cooperatives have been disrupted during the rush harvest and planting period; now it is necessary to quickly improve the labor organization situation.

    The editorial demanded that all agricultural technology extension stations, agricultural machinery stations and other technical forces in the province immediately devote themselves to field management. Various localities can also adopt various forms such as technical guidance groups to strengthen technical instruction and experience exchange in field management.

Summer Harvest and Planting Cannot Be Delayed

    On the 5th of this month, the Shandong Dazhong Daily published an editorial saying: At present, the progress of summer harvesting and planting in various parts of Shandong is very slow. The threshing of wheat and the summer planting work in most parts of the province have only completed 70%. About 10% of crops such as cotton, corn, sorghum, and millet have not been hoed, and 20% have not been thinned. Cotton aphids, locusts, corn borers and other pests are spreading.

    The editorial suggested that leading Party and government organs at all levels stop holding all non-essential meetings, simplify or postpone everything that can be simplified or postponed, and transfer forces that can be transferred to form temporary working groups to specifically help districts, townships, and cooperatives do a good job in production. Special attention should be paid to strengthening assistance to the approximately 10% of agricultural cooperatives that are not well managed.

    The editorial said that the work of wheat threshing, summer planting, and autumn field management should be carried out closely. Those who can plant sweet potatoes and corn should plant them immediately; those who cannot plant these crops should quickly switch to other crops.

    地方报纸的评论摘要
    全力争取秋季丰收
    河南日报在本月七日发表了题目是“全力争取秋季丰收”的社论。社论指出，今年小麦受灾，直接加重了秋季的农业增产任务；而今年的秋田管理工作，因为防汛、救灾工作紧张，以及雨水过多，肥料不足等等情况，增加了许多困难。目前，生产上的中心工作，是中耕锄草、增肥追肥，同时做好棉花、玉米、烟叶的栽培管理。
    为了做好这些工作，各地首先要把夏收夏种工作加以总结，开展群众性的田间大检查，合理安排各项农活，订好秋季农业增产计划。这样，可以增强农民对于争取秋季丰收的信心，也可以打破麻痹自满心里，发现和解决秋田管理上存在的严重问题。
    许多合作社的劳动管理办法，在抢收抢种期间被打乱了；现在需要迅速改善劳动组织状况。
    社论要求，全省农业技术推广站、农业机器站等技术力量，立即全部投入田间管理上去。各地还可以采取技术辅导团等多种形式，加强田间管理的技术传授和经验交流工作。
    夏收夏种，不能迟缓
    本月五日，山东大众日报发表社论说：目前，山东各地夏收夏种的进度很迟缓。全省大部地区的小麦脱粒，夏季播种工作仅完成70％。棉花、玉米、高粱、谷子等作物约有10％还没有锄头遍，20％还没有间苗。棉蚜、蝗虫、玉米钻心虫等虫害正在蔓延。
    社论建议各级党政领导机关，停止召开一切非急需的会议，简办或缓办一切可以从简或从缓的事情，并且抽调可以抽调的力量，组成临时工作组，具体帮助各区、乡、社搞好生产。特别对于10％左右的办的不好的农业合作社，要更注意加强帮助。
    社论说，对于打麦、夏种和秋田管理工作要抓紧进行。能种甘薯、玉米的，应该马上种上；不能种这些庄稼的要迅速改种其他作物。
