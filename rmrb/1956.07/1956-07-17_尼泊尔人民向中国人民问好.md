Greetings from the People of Nepal to the People of China

Friends:
	Hello! Greetings once again to you, our closest northern neighbors!
	Greetings once again to you, the people who have forever eliminated feudalism and foreign enslavement from the land of your motherland, and are now dedicated to the development and peaceful construction of your country!
	The people of Nepal can only wish you—our good neighbors—well and express our admiration for your recent heroic struggles. The achievements you have made under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao have brought hope to the people of Asia and Africa. It has changed the outlook of the whole world.
	The people of Nepal, through their own struggles, have also gained a certain degree of freedom since 1950; and with your goodwill and friendship, as we have received from our southern neighbors, we hope to be able to quickly transform and develop our motherland.
	Throughout history, Nepal has had political, cultural, and religious relations with your country, but it was only in the past few decades of this century that relations between our two governments stagnated; however, since the signing of the historic agreement on August 1, last year (1955) based on the Five Principles, or Panchsheel, diplomatic relations have been established between our two countries, and the friendly relations between us have become increasingly close. This was what the people of our country firmly demanded. We believe that the visit of our Nepalese delegation to China at the invitation of your government is a historic event and the beginning of further and closer friendly exchanges between the people of our two countries. Our association is very pleased with this visit. We extend our admiration and congratulations.

	Long live the friendship between Nepal and the People's Republic of China!
	Long live peace!
	Yours most sincerely,

	Purna Bahadur,
	President of the Nepal-China Friendship Association
					July 1, 1956

### 尼泊尔人民向中国人民问好

    外国朋友的来信
    尼泊尔人民向中国人民问好朋友们：
    你们好！向你们，我们的北方最近的邻居再次问好！
    向你们，已经从你们祖国的土地上永远消灭了封建和外国奴役的人们，而现在致力于你们国家的发展和和平建设工作的人们又一次问好！
    尼泊尔人民唯有向你们——我们的好邻居祝好，和对你们的最近的英勇斗争表示钦佩。你们在毛主席的英明领导下所取得的成就，给亚非人民带来了希望。它改变了整个世界的前景。
    尼泊尔人民经过自己的斗争，从1950年以来，也已取得了一定的自由；而且有了你们的善意和友谊，正如我们从我们南方的邻居那儿所得到的，我们希望能够很快地改造和发展我们的祖国。
    有史以来，尼泊尔就跟你们的国家有了政治上的、文化上的和宗教上的关系，只是到了本世纪过去的几十年间，我们两国政府的关系才停顿下来；可是自从去年（1955年）8月1日在五项原则或称潘查希拉的基础上签订了历史性的协定以来，我们两国之间建立了外交关系，而我们之间的友好关系更日益亲密起来。这曾经是我国人民所坚决要求的。我们相信，我们尼泊尔代表团这次应贵国政府的邀请前来访问中国，是一个历史性的事件，它是我们两国人民之间进一步的更加密切的友好往来的开端。我们协会对这次访问感到十分喜悦。谨致以我们的爱慕和祝贺。
    尼泊尔和中华人民共和国之间的友谊万岁！
    和平万岁！
    你们的最忠诚的
    尼泊尔—中国友好协会主席　普尔纳·巴哈杜尔
                                        1956年7月1日
