Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, July 27th: Kaesong News: Staff members of the Korean-Chinese side delegation to the Korean Military Armistice Commission held a gathering today to commemorate the third anniversary of the Korean Armistice.

	Korean-Chinese side Chief Member, Major General Zheng Guolu, delivered a report at the commemoration meeting. He pointed out that, thanks to the efforts of the people of Korea and China and the support of peace-loving people all over the world, the work of the Korean-Chinese side delegation has achieved great success, timely exposing and thwarting the US side's conspiracies to constantly violate and undermine the armistice agreement, and safeguarding the armistice agreement. Recently, the US side has openly undermined the work of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission and is arming the South Korean Syngman Rhee army with a large number of weapons and ammunition in an attempt to further undermine the armistice agreement.

	Major General Zheng Guolu finally said that the Korean people have always loved peace, and the Korean people's determination to strive for the peaceful reunification of Korea is unshakable. The Korean-Chinese side delegation will, in accordance with its consistent just stance in the past, make unremitting efforts to continue to consolidate the Korean Armistice Agreement.

	After the meeting, actors from the Korean National Choi Seung-hee Dance Research Institute, who had come to express their regards to the staff of the Korean-Chinese side delegation, gave a performance. Staff members from Poland, Sweden, Switzerland, and Czechoslovakia of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission were also invited to watch the performance.

    朝中方面代表团集会
    纪念朝鲜停战协定签订三周年
    新华社平壤27日电　开城消息：朝鲜军事停战委员会朝中方面代表团工作人员今天举行集会纪念朝鲜停战三周年。
    朝中方面首席委员郑国禄少将在纪念会上作了报告。他指出，由于朝中两国人民的努力和全世界爱好和平人民的支持，朝中方面代表团的工作取得了很大成就，及时揭露并且阻遏了美方不断违反和破坏停战协定的阴谋，维护了停战协定。近来，美方公开破坏中立国监察委员会的工作，并且正以大批武器弹药武装南朝鲜李承晚的军队，企图进一步破坏停战协定。
    郑国禄少将最后说，朝鲜人民一贯热爱和平，朝鲜人民争取和平统一朝鲜的决心是不可动摇的。朝中方面代表团将本着过去一贯的正义主张，为继续巩固朝鲜停战协定而不懈地努力。
    会后，特地前来慰问朝中方面代表团工作人员的朝鲜国立崔承喜舞踊研究所的演员们作了表演。中立国监察委员会的波兰、瑞典、瑞士和捷克斯洛伐克的工作人员也应邀观看了表演。
