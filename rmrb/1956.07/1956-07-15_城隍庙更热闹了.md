    The nearly 700-year-old Shanghai City God Temple is even more bustling today than usual, with at least ten thousand people braving the summer heat to visit this all-encompassing department store. People admire the scenic spots such as the Nine-Turn Bridge and the Inner Garden while selecting inexpensive and good-quality small commodities.

    This year is the first summer since the City God Temple market implemented joint public-private ownership and cooperation. In the past, the City God Temple relied on "one season a year" (spring), and summer was usually the off-season. This old rule has been broken this year, with the second quarter's turnover mostly exceeding the first quarter's.

    The densely packed shops and workshops, bearing the signs of joint public-private ownership or cooperatives, are busily receiving customers today. They all maintain the operating characteristics welcomed by consumers: abacus beads that have fallen off, erhu strings that have broken, and missing go pieces can all be replaced here. The various snack shops unique to the City God Temple are hanging signs that say "Supply Resumed." The famous fermented glutinous rice balls, Nanxiang steamed buns, pigeon egg glutinous rice balls, crystal dumplings, scallion oil noodles with dried shrimp, etc., all attract customers with their unique aromas. Zhang Zhifei's red bean sweet congee stall, which has been around for more than 80 years, is full of customers, and his turnover today has reached more than 30 yuan.

    Gathered on a small street, the doorways of more than a dozen bird shops are filled with cages of various birds and small animals. This street also has new customers today, as these stores now also sell rabbits, turtles, and other animals for medical testing or specimen preparation. A state-owned specimen factory in the Northeast once ordered more than a thousand large turtles from Rongshunxiang Bird Shop. (Ji Yin)

### 城隍庙更热闹了

    城隍庙更热闹了
    已有近七百年历史的上海古城隍庙，今天比平日显得更喧闹，至少有上万的人冒着盛暑来到了这座包罗万象的百货市场。人们一面观赏着九曲桥、内园等名胜古迹，一面选购价廉物美的小商品。
    今年是城隍庙市场实行了公私合营和合作化以后的第一个夏季。往年城隍庙是“一年靠一季”（春季），夏季照例是淡季。这个旧规律今年被打破了，二季度营业额大部分都超过了一季度。
    挂着公私合营或合作社招牌的密密层层的商店，作坊，今天忙碌地接待着顾客。它们都保持着为消费者所欢迎的经营特色，算盘掉了珠，胡琴断了弦，围棋缺了子，在这里都可以配齐。城隍庙所独有的各种小吃店挂着“恢复供应”的牌子。有名的酒酿园子、南翔包子、鸽蛋园子、水晶大包、开洋葱油面……都以特有的香味吸引着顾客。已有八十多年历史的张志飞的赤豆糖粥摊，坐满了顾客，他今天的营业额达三十多元。
    聚集在一条小街上的十几家鸟店门口，摆满着各种飞禽和小动物的笼子。这条街道上今天也来了新的顾客，原来这些商店都已兼卖医疗化验或制标本用的兔子、乌龟等各种动物。东北一家国营标本厂一次曾向荣顺祥鸟店订购了一千多只大乌龟。　（季　音）
