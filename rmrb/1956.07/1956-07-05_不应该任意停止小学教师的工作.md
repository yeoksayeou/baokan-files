    To the Editor:
    The education administrative departments in certain counties of Liaoning Province have not correctly implemented the State Council's "Instructions on Consolidating and Improving Primary School Education," and are arbitrarily stopping the work of primary school teachers. This year, in Tai'an County, the work of twelve primary school teachers has been stopped, and they have been mobilized to return to their hometowns. These teachers are all young people, and five of them are Youth League members who started working before 1951. Before three female teachers left the school, the principal talked to them for ten minutes, explaining that the reason for stopping their work was: "You all have two children, and hiring a nanny is not cost-effective, so it's better to go back and take care of the children yourselves!" These three female teachers raised objections at the time, expressing their willingness to hire a nanny. The principal had nothing to say, so he insisted that their "level was too low" and sent them away. Su Xuehui (Youth League member), a teacher at Dagao Lifang Complete Primary School in Tai'an County, has been active and responsible since starting work in 1950. He has served as the acting director of teaching affairs at the school and has also been elected as the chairman of the trade union. However, because he took sick leave to recuperate at home, the leadership included him in the list of those "whose work is to be stopped and who are to be mobilized to return to their hometowns." After he recovered, he repeatedly requested reinstatement from the County Bureau of Culture and Education and raised objections. A comrade from the Bureau of Culture and Education said: "If we reintroduce you to the work, then everyone else will have to come back, this won't work! If you have any opinions, go and raise them wherever you want!" When the Jin County education administrative department reorganized the primary school teacher ranks in 1954, it mobilized Song Qingge, who had 33 years of teaching experience, and Jiang Fangchun, who had more than 20 years of teaching experience, to return home to production. As a result, they have both experienced difficulties in their lives after returning home, and this problem has not been resolved to this day.
    The above situation has seriously affected the morale of primary school teachers and has created an extremely bad political impact. Many female teachers with children are very uneasy, and they are all trying to save money in preparation for being laid off in the future. Some primary school teachers are afraid to ask for leave when they are sick, fearing that the leadership will say that they are not working actively and order them to return home to production.

    不应该任意停止小学教师的工作
    编辑同志：
    辽宁省某些县的教育行政部门没有正确地执行政务院“关于整顿和改进小学教育的指示”，任意停止小学教师的工作。台安县今年有十二名小学教师被停止工作，动员回乡。这些教师都是青年人，其中有五名是1951年以前参加工作的青年团员。有三名女教师在离开学校前，校长找她们谈了十分钟的话，说明停止她们工作的理由是：“你们都有了两个孩子，雇保姆也不上算，不如自己回去照顾孩子！”这三位女教师当时提出意见，表示愿意雇保姆。校长没有话说了，就咬定“水平低”而把她们打发走了。台安县大高力房完全小学校教师苏学会（青年团员），1950年参加工作以来一直积极负责，代理过学校的教导主任，还被选为工会主席。但是因为他有病回家休养，领导方面便把他列入“停止工作、动员回乡”的名单中。他病好以后，曾多次向县文教科要求复职，并且提出意见。文教科的同志说：“给你介绍工作，其他的人就都得回来，这不成！你有意见愿到哪里提，就到哪里去吧！”锦县教育行政部门在1954年整顿小学教师队伍时，曾把具有三十三年教龄的宋庆格和有二十多年教龄的蒋芳春都动员回家生产。结果他们回家以后，生活都发生了困难，这个问题直到现在还得不到解决。
    上述情况，已经严重地影响了小学教师的情绪，造成了极坏的政治影响。许多有孩子的女教师思想都非常不安，她们都在想办法积钱，以备来日被停止工作后使用。有些小学教师得了病也不敢请假，恐怕领导上说他们工作不积极而叫回家生产。
