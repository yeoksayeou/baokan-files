Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, July 7th. China's first high-temperature, high-pressure thermal power plant using electronic automatic control—the Jilin Thermal Power Plant—officially transferred its first boiler and turbine generator to production yesterday after trial operation.

The members of the plant's startup committee and Soviet experts unanimously expressed their satisfaction with the installation quality and operation of this set of equipment.

This modern thermal power plant began construction in January of last year. The first unit to be put into production was six months ahead of the original plant construction plan.

After completion, the Jilin Thermal Power Plant will be one of China's largest combined heat and power projects. The equipment of this thermal power plant is mostly complete sets of automated equipment supplied by the Soviet Union. The main equipment here—the high-temperature and high-pressure boiler—is controlled by electronic automatic instruments. Operators, standing in front of the console, can clearly understand its entire operation through various instruments. This type of boiler burns low-grade coal, and its heating and power generation costs are quite low.

The Jilin Thermal Power Plant is built on the scenic banks of the Songhua River to meet the needs of industrial development in the Jilin area. In addition to supplying a large amount of electricity to industry in Northeast China, it will undertake the heating tasks of the newly built chemical plants such as the Jilin Calcium Carbide Plant, as well as the heating tasks for the employees' dormitories and offices of these factories.

At present, the main building of this large-scale thermal power plant is nearing completion, and the installation of other units and heat transmission pipelines is in full swing.

    吉林热电厂开始部分供热发电
    新华社长春7日电　中国第一座用电子自动控制的高温高压热电厂——吉林热电厂的第一台锅炉和透平发电机，经过试运转以后，在昨天正式移交生产。
    这个厂的起动委员会的委员同苏联专家们，对这套设备的安装质量和运行情况，一致表示满意。
    这座现代化的热电厂是去年一月开始动工兴建的。最先投入生产的一台机炉，较原定的建厂计划提前了半年。
    吉林热电厂建成以后，将是中国最大的供热、发电两用的动力工程之一。这座热电厂的装备大部是由苏联供给的成套自动化设备。这里的主要设备——高温高压锅炉是用电子式自动仪表控制的。操作人员站在操作台前，依靠各种仪表，能够清楚地了解它的全部运行情况。这种锅炉燃用劣煤，它的供热、发电的成本相当低廉。
    吉林热电厂建设在风景优美的松花江畔，它是为适应吉林地区工业发展的需要而建设的。除了供应东北地区工业大量的电力以外，它将担负吉林电石厂等新建的化工厂的供热任务，以及这些工厂的职工宿舍、办公室采暖任务。
    目前这座规模宏大的热电厂的主厂房快要全部建成了，其他各台机炉和输热管道的安装，正在紧张进行中。
