　　As early as 1883, George Bernard Shaw came into contact with Marxism. After reading Henry George's "Progress and Poverty," he was determined to study "Das Kapital." However, at that time, there was no English translation of "Das Kapital," and he only managed to find a French translation at the British Museum. He said more than once: reading "Das Kapital" gave his life meaning. "Before Marx turned me into a communist, I was a coward. He gave me confidence and made me a man." He also said: "Marx was a revelation to me, a turning point in my life, because he unveiled the world for me, allowing me to see the true face of history and civilization, providing me with a new concept of the universe, and helping me find the meaning and mission of life."
　　Judging from Shaw's works, he still had many contradictions and unscientific views on life, so Lenin said he was "a good man trapped among the Fabians," and Lunacharsky said he was an unwelcome guest in life, not a fighter. Despite this, he always ridiculed the bourgeois regime and wholeheartedly supported the Soviet Union. Living among so many opportunists, he was able to maintain such a clear position, which must be attributed to the initial inspiration "Das Kapital" gave him.
　　Shaw was not a writer who buried himself in a study; he actively participated in life. According to himself, when he was in his thirties, he gave an average of six lectures on socialism every month, sometimes on the street, sometimes in pubs, and more often in Hyde Park in London. In these activities, he naturally had conflicts with the police. Once, it was raining heavily in London, and he was giving an open-air speech in Hyde Park. According to him, the audience consisted of only six policemen monitoring him and the secretary of the society that invited him to speak—who kept holding an umbrella for him. Shaw later recalled: "I tried my best to make the police interested in what I was saying, and I gave them more than an hour of entertainment. Even now, when I close my eyes, I can still see the rainwater running down their raincoats." He considered it the most successful speech of his life.
　　In his speeches, he inevitably had to denounce the bourgeois government. In a speech titled "Anarchy Won't Work" in 1888, he said: "The current government is nothing more than a huge machine that uses violence to plunder and enslave the poor."
　　In 1917, when the Russian people resolutely refused to participate in the imperialist war, the bigwigs of the Fabian Society expressed deep hostility towards the emerging socialist country. At one such anti-Russian conference, Shaw sat quietly in a corner of the venue, without saying a word. As the meeting was about to end, he suddenly stood up and shouted, "Since we are socialists, Russia's position is our position."
　　In the same year, he wrote to a friend in the United States, saying: "The news from Russia isn't bad, is it? However, this situation is not what the Entente powers originally expected, just as Bismarck did not expect France to become a republic in 1870."
　　In 1931, he was invited to visit the Soviet Union. Upon arriving in Moscow, he said at the welcoming banquet:
　　"If the experiment initiated by Lenin succeeds, the world will enter a new century; if it fails, I will surely die full of sorrow. But if the future is as Lenin predicted, then we can face the future without fear and with a smile." At the farewell banquet, he said again: "I am now bidding farewell to the land of hope and returning to the land of despair."
　　On his way back, passing through Warsaw, a group of bourgeois reporters surrounded him, hoping to extract some anti-Soviet material from him. Shaw solemnly told them: "To return mankind to capitalism is tantamount to branding mankind. If you see Bolshevism on the spot, you will have no doubt that the end of capitalism is inevitable."
　　Someone once encouraged Shaw to visit the United States, and he replied: "The American people don't know that if I honestly express my views on politics and religion, I won't even be allowed to land."

    萧伯纳二三事
    萧乾
    远在1883年，萧伯纳就接触了马克思主义。读完了亨利·乔治的“进步与贫穷”一书，他下决心要研究“资本论”。可是当时“资本论”还没有英译本，好容易他才在大英博物馆找到一部法译本。他说过不止一次：读了“资本论”，他的生命才有了意义。“在马克思把我变成一个共产主义者以前，我是个懦夫。他给了我信心，使我成为一个人。”他还说：“马克思对我是个启示，是我一生的转折点，因为他替我揭开了世界的面罩，使我看到历史和文明的真实面目，提供我一个对宇宙崭新的观念，叫我找到人生的意义和使命。”
    从萧伯纳的作品来看，他对人生还存在着许多矛盾和不科学的看法，所以列宁说他是“陷到费边社一帮人中间的一个好人”，卢纳察斯基说他在生活中是个不速之客，而不是个斗士。尽管这样，他对于资产阶级政权一直是冷嘲热骂的，对于苏联，他一直是衷心拥护的。生活在那么多机会主义者中间，他能坚持这样鲜明的立场，这不能不归功于“资本论”最初给他的启发。
    萧伯纳不是个埋首在书斋里的作家，他积极地参与生活。据他自己说，他三十几岁上，每个月平均要做六次关于社会主义的演讲，有时候是在街头，有时候是在酒馆里，更多的时候是在伦敦的海德公园。在这些活动里，他自然短不了跟警察起冲突。有一回伦敦下着倾盆大雨，他站在海德公园露天演讲，据他说听众只有六名监视他的警察和邀他去演讲的那个学会的秘书——他一直帮演讲者撑着伞。萧伯纳后来回忆说：“我拼命讲得叫警察听起来感到兴趣，我给了他们一个多钟头的娱乐。到现在闭上眼睛，我还能看见他们穿的防雨斗篷上面淌的雨水。”他认为那是他一生最得意的一次演讲。
    在讲词里，他总不免要痛骂资产阶级政府。1888年，在一篇题为“无政府行不通”的演讲里，他说：“目前这种政府不过是个凭借暴力掠夺和奴役穷人的巨大机器。”
    1917年，当俄罗斯人民毅然拒绝参加帝国主义战争的时候，费边社的衮衮诸公对新兴的社会主义国家表示了深切的敌意。在一次这种反俄的大会上，萧伯纳一直坐在会场的一个角落里，一声不吭。快散会的时候，他忽然站起来，大声嚷道：“咱们既然是社会主义者，俄罗斯的立场就是咱们的立场。”
    同年他写信给一个在美国的朋友说：“俄国的消息不坏，对吗？然而这局面可不是参战国原来所期望的，正如1870年俾斯麦没期望叫法国成为共和国一样。”
    1931年，他应邀访问苏联。到了莫斯科，他在欢迎宴会上说：
      “列宁创始的这个尝试如果成功了，世界将进入一个崭新的世纪；如果失败了，我死的时候一定满腹悲哀的。可是如果未来正像列宁所预示的，那么我们就可以毫无惧色、满面笑容地面向未来了。”在饯别的宴会上，他又说：“我如今是向希望之土告别，回到那绝望之土上去”。
    归途路过华沙，一群资产阶级记者把他密密匝匝地包围起来，希望能从他那里挤出点反苏的资料。萧伯纳庄重地告诉他们说：“要人类重新回到资本主义上去，那就等于给人类上烙刑。如果你在现场看到了布尔什维主义，你就不会怀疑资本主义的末日必然到来了。”
    曾经有人怂恿萧伯纳访问美国，他回答说：“美国人民不晓得如果我把对政治和宗教的看法老老实实地讲出来，我连上岸的许可也得不到的。”
