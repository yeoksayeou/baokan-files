Thank You, Members of the Peking Opera Troupe!
    Nakamura Shizue

The esteemed members of the Peking Opera Troupe are about to return to their country, and I am writing this reflection with a sense of reluctant farewell.

I am a housewife from a poor family of seven, a mere employee's family. I wouldn't have dared to dream of seeing any kind of opera, and I had never seen Kabuki. However, this time I was determined to see Peking Opera at least once. Finally, my wish came true. At the Peking Opera benefit performance on July 12th, to my surprise, I saw both the daytime and evening performances. My gratitude is beyond words. I don't understand art at all, but the scenes on the stage strongly attracted me, and I couldn't help but be excited and moved.

The four plays, "Havoc in Heaven," "At the Crossroads," "Mount Yandang," and "Autumn River," felt like taking an elixir, instantly dispelling the accumulated fatigue of years of housework, and completely immersing me in a relaxed and happy atmosphere. In addition, Mr. Mei's elegant and beautiful acting in "The Drunken Concubine" and "Lady Yu" made me feel as if I were actually there.

What touched my heart even more deeply were the images of the characters on stage. Every move made me feel as if my own relatives were appearing on the stage. The joys and sorrows of the characters in the play were my own joys and sorrows. As I watched, I was reminded of the images of my ancient ancestors and the long-standing friendship between the two peoples since ancient times.

After watching Sun Wukong eat immortal peaches and pills, gaining immortality, and using his great powers to defeat the heavenly soldiers and generals, I even fantasized: "Isn't there a magical power like Sun Wukong's, enough to eliminate atomic bombs, hydrogen bombs, or radioactivity?"

I don't understand complicated politics, but I would like to silently wish: that the Japanese people, who have tasted the bitterness of defeat, can shake hands tightly with the Chinese people, who treat us with generosity and friendship, as soon as possible, and relive the friendship of the past. Here, I would like to express my greetings to the Chinese people.

This unexpected gain has made me forget the sadness of a poor home without an electric washing machine or a juicer. Now, I am happily washing clothes vigorously in the kitchen. Here, I once again thank the members of the Peking Opera Troupe. I hope to see you all again in the near future.

### 谢谢你们，京剧团的诸位！

    谢谢你们，京剧团的诸位！
    中村静枝
    京剧团的诸位先生们都要回国去了，我以惜别的心情写下这篇感想。
    我是一个贫苦的七口之家的职员家庭之主妇，连想都不敢想看什么戏，也没看过歌舞伎，但是，这次说什么我也得看一次京剧。终于如愿以偿了，七月十二日的京剧义演，出乎意料地我看了昼夜两场，感激之情是说不完道不尽的。我一点也不懂得艺术，但是舞台场面强烈地吸引了我，使我不能不为之兴奋感动。
      “闹天宫”、“三岔口”、“雁荡山”、“秋江”四出戏，对于我好像吃了一服仙丹灵药，瞬息间忘却了长年家事的积劳，完全沉浸在轻松愉快的气氛之中。此外，梅先生的优雅艳丽的“贵妃”、“虞姬”的演技，使我恍忽间有身临其境之感。
    比这些更深刻地打动心弦的是舞台人物的形象，一举一动无一不使我感到尤如自己的亲人出现在台上，剧中人的喜怒哀乐就是我的喜怒哀乐，看着，看着，我联想起自己的远古祖先的形象，并想起两国人民之间自古以来的绵长的友谊。
    看了孙悟空吃仙桃仙丹之后能够长生不老，神通广大而大破天兵天将时，我竟幻想着：“难道没有像孙悟空的神通那样；足以消灭原子弹氢弹或放射能的法术么？”
    我不懂得难缠的政治，但是，我愿意默祝：饱尝战败苦头的日本人，能够尽早地和待我以宽大友好的中国人紧紧地握起手来，重温昔日的友谊是再好没有的了。我这里谨向中国人民致意。
    这场意外的收获，使我忘却了没有电气洗衣机和挤果汁机的穷家的悲哀，现在，我愉快地在厨房里用劲地洗着衣服，这里再一次向京剧团的诸位致谢了。但愿最近的将来能再一次和各位见面。
