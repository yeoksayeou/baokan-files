Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang – In the first half of this year, factories and basic construction units in Shenyang promoted 3,956 outstanding cadres and equipped 10,211 reserve cadres ready to be transferred to new industrial and mining enterprises. Among the newly promoted and equipped cadres, there were 1,517 Party committee secretaries, factory directors, and engineers.

Shenyang City is responsible for supplying cadres to new industrial and mining enterprises. Many factories are expected to train a full set of cadres equivalent to the needs of one to three factories of their current size within the next two years. To accomplish this task, all units have actively carried out the work of promoting and training cadres. Many of the newly promoted and equipped cadres are advanced figures who have emerged this year. Liang Zhifu, an advanced producer and deputy director of the zinc electrolysis workshop at Shenyang Smelter, was originally a section chief in the workshop. Because of his continuous study of professional skills and solving many key production problems, he was promoted to deputy director of the workshop. Chen Changgeng, a new technician promoted in the process section of the Shenyang Pneumatic Tool Factory, used to be a worker. Through hard work, his technical level has improved significantly. Now, he is a third-year student in the night university of Northeast Institute of Technology.

This year, industrial production and construction units in Shenyang City have formulated plans for promoting and training cadres and have established systems for training and managing cadres. Many units have adopted the "master-apprentice" method to train cadres in actual work. At the same time, employees are also organized into the spare-time education network by category. According to the statistics of the Shenyang Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, the number of employees in the city's factories and construction units currently participating in cultural and technical studies has reached more than 186,000.

    发挥现有工业基地的巨大作用
    沈阳市大规模地为新建企业培养干部
    新华社沈阳电　沈阳各工厂和基本建设单位，今年上半年提拔了3，956名优秀干部，还配备了10，211名准备输送给新建工矿企业的后备干部。在新提拔和配备起来的干部中，仅企业的中共党委书记、厂长、工程师就有1，517名。
    沈阳市担负着为新建工矿企业输送干部的任务。不少工厂在今明两年内要培养相等于各厂现有规模一个到三个工厂需要的全套干部。各单位为了完成这一任务，都积极地进行了提拔干部和培养干部的工作。新提拔和配备的干部中，有很多是今年新涌现出来的先进人物。先进生产者、沈阳冶炼厂锌电解车间副主任梁志福，原来是这个车间的一个工段长。由于他不断地钻研业务，解决了不少生产关键问题，被提拔为车间副主任。沈阳风动工具厂工艺科新提拔的技师陈长庚，过去是一个工人，他经过刻苦努力，技术水平有了显著提高。现在，他已经是东北工学院夜大学的三年级生。
    今年，沈阳市的工业生产和建设单位都制定了提拔干部和培养干部的规划，建立了有关培养、管理干部的制度。许多单位采取了“师傅带徒弟”的办法，在实际工作中培养干部。同时，也把职工分门别类地组织在业余教育网里。据中共沈阳市委员会统计：全市工厂、建设单位目前参加文化、技术学习的职工人数已经达到十八万六千多名。
