Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, 19th: The Wuli Coal Mine on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau is undergoing trial mining. The several hundred tons of coal already mined are being transported by truck to various stations and sections along the Qinghai-Tibet Highway near the Tanggula Mountains, as well as to construction teams participating in the Qinghai-Tibet Highway renovation project.

	In the second half of this year, the Wuli Coal Mine preparatory office will construct the first batch of power plant buildings, repair shops, offices, and employee dormitories. Construction workers from Chongqing, Xi'an, Henan, and other places have arrived at the construction site one after another.

	Wuli cannot yet be found on maps. It is located on an uninhabited prairie upstream of the Tongtian River. In 1954, workers building the Qinghai-Tibet Highway discovered coal here and named it Wuli. Preliminary geological surveys have proven that this area has extremely rich coal deposits. The Wuli Coal Mine will gradually expand production in the future to supply the needs of various places in Tibet.

    青藏高原上的煤矿
    新华社拉萨19日电　青藏高原上的乌丽煤矿正在作试验性的开采，已经采出的几百吨煤炭，由卡车运往青藏公路唐古拉山附近各站、段和参加青藏公路整修工程的各工队。
    今年下半年，乌丽煤矿筹备处将建筑第一批发电厂厂房、修配厂、办公室和职工宿舍、来自重庆、西安和河南等地的建筑工人，已陆续到达工地。
    人们现在在地图上还找不到乌丽的名字，它在通天河上游一个荒无人烟的大草原上。1954年修筑青藏公路的职工发现这里有煤，他们给它命名为乌丽。经地质人员初步勘察，证明这一带有着极为丰富的煤藏。乌丽煤矿今后将逐渐扩大生产，供给西藏各地的需要。
