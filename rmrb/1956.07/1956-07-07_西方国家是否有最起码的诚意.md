The United Nations Disarmament Commission began its meeting in New York on July 3 to discuss the report of the Disarmament Subcommittee's London meeting this year. In this international situation which has already tended to ease, and with the principle of peaceful coexistence being widely accepted, the people of all countries have reason to expect that this meeting can break the deadlock of many years and achieve practical progress on this issue of worldwide concern, so that the world can reduce the burden of armaments and use the enormous wisdom, labor, and material wealth that has been consumed in armaments to benefit the people.

But people are uneasily aware that the first day of the meeting again showed two diametrically opposed attitudes.

The British representative, Mr. Nutting, who presented the proposal on behalf of the Western countries, while acknowledging that "multilateral disarmament would be the greatest creator of security and peace," and acknowledging that the Soviet Union's initiative to reduce 1.2 million troops was "welcome" and that "such unilateral disarmament on both sides may achieve some kind of balance," he opposed the Western countries following the Soviet example to turn the Soviet Union's unilateral action into multilateral disarmament by major powers, thereby promoting world security and peace.

Nutting demanded that the Soviet Union reach a disarmament agreement with the Western countries. It seems that the Western countries are now very enthusiastic about reaching a disarmament agreement. Thank heavens for that. But that is not the case.

The consistent attitude of the Western countries has been to express the desire for disarmament with the most empty rhetoric possible, while avoiding the substantive issues of disarmament. They take no action that would help to reach a disarmament agreement, and turn the negotiations into endless debates on some non-substantive issues that are completely irrelevant to disarmament.

The proposal put forward by the Western countries at the New York meeting this time is new evidence of this attitude of the Western countries. This proposal contains nothing new, it just repeats the arguments that the Western countries used to oppose reaching an agreement at the London meeting. Its main points are as follows:

1.  Disarmament in stages, but the beginning of each stage depends on the resolution of important political issues.

This makes any wonderful provisions on disarmament become empty talk on paper. The Western countries will be able to use certain outstanding international disputes or create new disputes to make disarmament practically impossible to begin, while being able to shift the responsibility to others.

2.  Supervision, including aerial inspection, should be a starting step and proceed simultaneously with disarmament.

This is a modified version of the United States' proposal to use aerial inspection as a prerequisite for disarmament. In fact, it is still using the method of demanding aerial inspection, which is ineffective and increases suspicion, to obstruct the resolution of the disarmament issue.

3.  If a "threat to peace" arises, disarmament should be stopped in whole or in part.

Only those who intend to make excuses to abandon any possible agreement at some point would demand such a provision.

The speech by the US representative Mr. Lodge at the New York meeting, is a clear example of trying to use tedious debate to reject substantive discussions on disarmament. He reduced the entire disarmament issue to an aerial inspection issue, simply rejecting the practical method of disarmament by major powers, and posed a series of purely fictitious questions to the Soviet representative, such as "Why does the Soviet Union despise the work of the United Nations?"

But the fatal weakness of the Western countries' position lies in the serious contradiction between their superficial enthusiasm and their true intentions. When they try to use false words to conceal their true intention of obstructing a disarmament agreement, they put themselves in a logically ridiculous position. In order to belittle the significance of the Soviet Union's disarmament actions, they said that such disarmament actions are the result of a sense of security. So how can we increase the sense of security? They also said that people will only feel relieved when everyone knows that disarmament is really being implemented.

In contrast to the ambiguous and self-contradictory attitude of the Western countries, the Soviet Union's attitude at this New York meeting is as clear as it has always been, which is to strive to narrow differences in order to achieve even a preliminary agreement on the issue of disarmament. Because even a preliminary agreement will help to further improve the international atmosphere, increase international trust and understanding, and facilitate reaching an agreement on comprehensive disarmament.

Even some Western newspapers and public opinion, which are by no means sympathetic to the Soviet Union, admit that the Soviet Union has made constructive efforts more than once to reach an agreement. At the London meeting, the Soviet representative also suggested that at least an agreement could be reached on such simple and feasible preliminary measures as immediately stopping nuclear weapons tests and reducing foreign troops stationed in Germany. But even this was flatly rejected by the Western countries.

After the London meeting, the Soviet government, in the spirit of taking action to eliminate doubts and promote agreements, took the major decision to disarm on its own initiative. Following the Soviet example, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and the German Democratic Republic have all announced their decisions to disarm. Soviet Premier Bulganin also specifically sent letters to the Western countries, earnestly suggesting that they also take practical actions to disarm, thereby promoting the resolution of the entire disarmament issue. However, the Western countries not only failed to show corresponding sincerity to these constructive actions and suggestions of socialist countries, but also made malicious distortions to cover up their refusal to disarm.

Soviet representative Gromyko pointed out at the New York meeting that the Western countries' regressive attitude on a series of disarmament issues complicates disarmament negotiations and makes it virtually impossible to reach an agreement on disarmament issues. This criticism is undoubtedly correct and well-founded.

Nevertheless, the Soviet representative stated that the Soviet government still believes that efforts should continue to be made to achieve practical progress on the issue of disarmament that meets the expectations of the people of all countries. To do this, disarmament should not depend on the resolution of other international issues, but should adapt to the current situation which is tending to ease, and take concrete and practical actions to reduce armed forces and stop the expansion of armaments. In order to be able to reach an agreement at least on the main spirit of disarmament, the Soviet representative proposed a "Draft Declaration of States on Strengthening World Peace and Security." The draft stipulates that states undertake obligations not to use force or the threat of force in their international relations, nor to use atomic and hydrogen weapons.

There is no doubt that if countries can jointly declare and undertake these sacred obligations, it will powerfully promote the cause of consolidating peace and security, help to reduce the threat of atomic war and finally reach an agreement on the complete prohibition of nuclear weapons.

The recent declaration issued by the Standing Committee of the World Peace Council emphasized the universal desire of the peoples of all countries for disarmament, and requested that governments and the United Nations be able to conclude the first few agreements expected by the peoples of all countries. The Standing Committee also specifically wrote to the governments of the Soviet Union, the United States, and the United Kingdom, requesting that an agreement to stop atomic weapons tests be concluded without delay to prevent the spread of radioactive poisoning and to prove their sincerity in seeking to conclude more comprehensive agreements. The wishes of the people of the whole world expressed by the Standing Committee of the World Peace Council should be given serious consideration by governments and the United Nations.

The Western countries recently insisted that the Soviet Union had changed its position on the issue of banning nuclear weapons, and said that this was the reason why the London meeting failed to reach an agreement. They have also expressed opposition to the use of force and the threat of force in international relations countless times in official statements and propaganda. If the Western countries are truly sincere in this regard, then reaching an agreement on the basis of the draft proposed by the Soviet Union will not be difficult. Reaching an agreement on this draft will not only not harm the interests of any country, but will also promote universal peace and security. It is all beneficial and without any harm. Whether the Western countries accept this draft will prove whether they have the minimum sincerity.

### 西方国家是否有最起码的诚意

    西方国家是否有最起码的诚意
    联合国裁军委员会七月三日开始在纽约举行会议，讨论裁军小组委员会今年伦敦会议的报告。在这国际局势已经趋于缓和、和平共处原则被广泛接受的情况下，各国人民有理由期望这次会议能够打开多年来的僵局，就这个全世界人民所迫切关怀的问题取得实际的进展，以便世界能够减轻军备负担，把迄今消耗于军备的大量智慧、劳力和物质财富用来为人民谋福利。
    但是人们不安地注意到，第一天会议就又表现出两种截然相反的态度。
    代表西方国家提出提案的英国代表纳丁在发言中虽然承认，“多方面裁军将是安全和和平的最大的一个缔造者”，承认苏联主动采取的裁减一百二十万军队的决定是“可以欢迎的”，而且“双方面进行的这种单方面裁军或许将会达到某种均势”，但是他却反对西方国家仿效苏联的榜样，把苏联这单方面行动变为各大国的多方面裁军，从而促进世界安全和和平。
    纳丁要求苏联同西方国家达成裁军协议。看来西方国家现在非常热心于取得裁军的协议了。那真是谢天谢地。可是事实并不是这样。
    西方国家一向的态度是：用尽可能空泛的辞藻表示裁军的意愿，而避开裁军的实质问题。不采取任何有助于达成裁军协议的行动，把谈判变成在一些非实质性的以至是同裁军全不相干的问题上展开无休止的辩论。
    这一次西方国家在纽约会议上提出的提案，是西方国家这种态度的新的证据。这个提案没有一点新的内容，只是把西方国家在伦敦会议上用来反对达成协议的论点重复一遍。它的主要之点是这样的：
    1．分阶段裁军，但是每一阶段的开始要取决于重要政治问题的解决。
    这一条使得关于裁军的任何美妙规定都会变成纸上空谈。西方国家将能利用某些悬而未决的国际争端或者制造新的争端来使裁军实际上不能开始，同时却可以把责任推到别人身上。
    2．包括空中视察在内的监督工作应当作为开始步骤，并同裁军同时进行。
    这一条是美国以空中视察作为裁军先决条件的建议的改装。实际上仍然是以要求实行空中视察这种毫无实效反足以增加猜疑的方法，来阻挠裁军问题的解决。
    3．如果产生了“对和平的威胁”，就全部或部分地停止裁军。
    只有预先就打算在某个时候造出借口来废弃可能达成的协议的人，才会要求作这样的规定。
    美国代表洛奇在纽约会议上的发言，是力图以烦琐的辩论来排斥关于裁军的实质性讨论的显明例证。他把整个裁军问题归结为一个空中视察问题，干脆拒绝了各大国各自裁军的切实办法，而向苏联代表提出了一连串诸如“为什么苏联轻视联合国工作”这类纯属虚构的问题。
    但是西方国家立场的致命弱点，在于他们的表面热诚和真实意图之间存在着严重的矛盾。当他们企图用虚伪的词令来掩饰他们阻挠裁军协议的真实意图时，他们就使自己在逻辑上陷于可笑的地位。为了贬低苏联裁军行动的意义，他们说这种裁军的行动是安全感的结果。那么怎样才能增加安全感呢？他们又说，只有大家知道裁军真在实行时才会放心。
    同西方国家暧昧和自相矛盾的态度相对照，苏联的态度在这次纽约会议上和它历来一贯地采取的态度一样明确，这就是力求缩小分歧，以便在裁军问题上取得即便是初步的协议。因为即便是初步的协议，也有助于进一步改善国际气氛，增加国际间的信任和谅解，便利于就全面裁军问题取得协议。
    连西方国家某些绝非对苏联怀有同情的报纸舆论也承认，苏联曾不止一次地为达成协议而作出建设性的努力。在伦敦会议上，苏联代表还曾建议至少能就立即停止核子武器试验和减少驻德国的外国军队这样简易可行的初步措施取得协议。可是就连这一点也被西方国家一口拒绝了。
    在伦敦会议后，苏联政府本着以行动来消除疑虑和推进协议的精神，主动采取了裁军的重大决定。仿效苏联的榜样，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国、越南民主共和国和德意志民主共和国都先后宣布决定裁军。苏联总理布尔加宁还特意分别致函西方国家，恳切建议它们同样采取裁军的实际行动，从而促进整个裁军问题的解决。可是西方国家对社会主义国家这些建设性的行动和建议不但没有表现相应的诚意，而且还进行恶意的歪曲，以掩盖它们拒绝裁军的事实。
    苏联代表葛罗米柯在纽约会议上指出，西方国家在裁军的一系列问题上倒退的态度，使裁军谈判复杂化，并使裁军问题实际上失去达成协议的可能。这个批评无疑是正确和有根据的。
    虽然如此，苏联代表表明，苏联政府仍然认为，应该继续努力在裁军问题上取得符合于各国人民期望的实际进展。要做到这一点，就要求不把裁军取决于其他国际问题的解决，而应当适应目前趋向于和缓的局势，采取裁减武装部队和停止扩充军备的具体切实的行动。为了能够至少在裁军的主要精神方面达成协议，苏联代表提出了“各国关于巩固世界和平和安全的宣言草案”。草案里规定各国承担义务，在它们的国际关系中不使用武力或武力威胁，也不使用原子武器和氢武器。
    毫无疑问，如果各国能共同宣布承担起这些神圣义务，将有力地促进巩固和平与安全的事业，有助于缩小原子战争的威胁并最后就完全禁止核子武器达成协议。
    世界和平理事会常务委员会最近发表的宣言中，强调指出了各国人民希望裁军的普遍愿望，并要求各国政府和联合国能够缔结为各国人民所期望的头几个协定。常务委员会还特地致书苏、美、英三国政府。要求刻不容缓地缔结停止原子武器试验的协定，以制止放射性毒害的散布，并证明它们有谋求缔结更加完善的协定的诚意。世界和平理事会常务委员会所表达的这种全世界人民的愿望，应当得到各国政府和联合国的认真重视。
    西方国家最近曾硬说苏联在禁止核子武器问题上改变了立场，并说这是伦敦会议未能达成协议的原因。它们也曾在官方声明和宣传中无数次表示反对在国际关系中使用武力和武力威胁。如果西方国家真有这种诚意，那么在苏联提出的草案的基础上达成协议将不是困难的。就这个草案达成协议不但不会损害任何国家的利益，而且能增进普遍的和平与安全。有百利而无一弊。西方国家是否接受这个草案，将证明它们是否有最起码的诚意。
