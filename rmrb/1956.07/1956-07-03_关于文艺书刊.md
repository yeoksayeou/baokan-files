    Regarding Literary Books and Periodicals
    Yun He
    As a reader who frequently engages with literary books and periodicals, I often find myself pondering a few questions. These questions are not related to the ideological content of the books and periodicals, but they seem worth mentioning.
    First is the issue of language. Literary books and periodicals are different in nature from general scientific books and periodicals. From scientific books and periodicals, we mainly hope to gain knowledge, so as long as the writer can explain the principles correctly and clearly, they have basically completed their task. Literary works, however, should have the ability to stir emotions and uplift and delight the spirit. Reading literary works is a form of spiritual cultivation and enjoyment. Language is the tool of literature. That's why we say writers are artists of language. However, the language of some literary books and periodicals currently seems too lacking in refinement. Grammar is created arbitrarily, vocabulary is impoverished and dry, adjectives are piled up in heaps, and sentences are so long that one forgets the beginning by the time one reaches the end. Sentences that are completely incomprehensible leave one feeling "lost"; sentences that are barely understandable leave one feeling "bored."
    Second is the issue of layout and typography. On this issue, I focus on books. I believe that layout, typography, and binding are important components of literary books—here I won't talk about other books—and are by no means insignificant. Some books in China in the past had such spacious margins, such clear and distinct lines, such refreshing fonts, and such beautiful and elegant binding that was convenient for reading—isn't the purpose of books to be read? —Reading such books could truly be called "a pleasure in life." Seeing such books, even people who don't particularly like to read would come to love reading. Some books now are not like that. They are crammed from top to bottom, with dense layers of small print, lines packed tightly together. Readers who want to add a note or jot down a few words can't find a place to write, and they have to use both hands to read. Reading such books is simply torture. Some people say that paying attention to layout and binding is a manifestation of bourgeois ideology and that in an era where the working people are in charge, we should not emphasize this. This is slandering the working people. Just look at how ordinary people buy a calendar or a small ledger, they also choose ones with beautiful colors and styles. This shows that the people love beauty.
    Third, there is the issue of pricing. Currently, the prices of many books are unreasonably high. What is especially unreasonable is the pricing of some facsimile and reprint editions of classical masterpieces. Publishing these ready-made books requires relatively little effort, and there is no need to pay royalties. Sometimes the quality of the paper and binding is also very poor, so why are the prices set so high? In the past, private publishers pursued high profits, but what are state-owned publishers pursuing now? It is understandable that state-owned enterprises need to complete the task of remitting profits, but at the same time, they should also look downwards and consider the state's policy of continuously raising the cultural level of the people.
    Finally, there is a small issue. It is perfectly correct that the number of publications should be planned. However, as far as periodicals are concerned, we should also try to take care of the customers who buy single copies. Sometimes readers really can't subscribe to all the periodicals they want to read in advance. Publishers should make appropriate adjustments to the print runs of individual periodicals at any time, based on the actual needs of readers.
    The problems in the distribution of books and periodicals are also serious, and readers outside of Beijing have endless grievances.

    关于文艺书刊
    云何
    作为一个经常接触文艺书籍刊物的读者，我心里有几个问题常在转圈儿。这些问题与书刊的思想内容都没有关系，可是似乎也值得提一提。
    首先是语言问题。文艺书刊跟一般科学书刊性质不一样。从科学书刊里，我们主要是希望得到知识，所以只要写文章的人能把道理说得正确而清楚，基本上就算完成了任务。文艺作品却应该有可以激动情感、使人精神向上而愉快的作用。阅读文艺作品是一种精神修养和享受。语言是文学的工具。我们说作家是语言艺术家，就是这道理。然而目前有些文艺书刊的语言似乎太欠讲究了。语法随意创造，词汇贫乏而枯燥，形容词叠了一大堆，句子长得使人看到末尾忘了开头。根本看不懂的句子叫人看了感觉到“茫然”；勉强看懂了的句子叫人看了感觉到“索然”。
    其次是版式行款问题。在这问题上，我着重的是书籍。我觉得版式、行款、装订是文艺书籍的——这里我不谈别的书——重要组成因素，决不是无关紧要的东西。中国从前有些书；天地那么开阔，行格那么疏朗，字体那么爽目，装订那么美观大方而便于阅读——难道书籍的用途不是供人阅读吗？——阅读那种书真说得上是“人生一乐”。看见了那种书，本来不大爱读书的人也会爱读书。现在有些书可就不然了。上顶天而下立地，中间密密层层，一行行小号字挤得紧紧的，读者想加一条批或是注几个字，都找不出下笔的地方，并且读的时候还必须双手一齐用。阅读那种书简直是受罪。有人说，讲究版式装订是资产阶级思想的表现，劳动人民当家作主的年代不该着重这一套。这是诬蔑劳动人民的话。只要看老百姓买一张月份牌，买一个小账本儿，也要挑颜色式样好看的，就知道人民爱美不爱美。
    再其次，是定价问题。目前有许多书定价高得没道理。尤其没道理的是一些古典名著的影印本和翻印本。刊印这种现成书，费力比较少，也不用付稿费，有时候纸张和装订的质量都很差，价钱为什么要定得那么高？过去私营出版社追求的是高额利润，现在国营出版社追求的是什么？国营企业需要完成上缴利润的任务，这是可以理解的，然而同时也应该把眼睛往下看一看，想一想国家要不断提高人民文化水平的政策。
    最后还有个小问题。出版数量要有计划性，这是完全正确的。可是，就期刊方面说，也应该尽量照顾一下零买的主顾。有时候读者的确没法子把要看的期刊预先全部订下来。出版社应该针对读者的实际需要对于个别刊物的印数随时作出适当的伸缩。
    书刊发行方面存在的问题也严重，北京以外的读者更是有苦说不尽。
