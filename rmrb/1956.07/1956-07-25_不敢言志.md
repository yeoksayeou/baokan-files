    Afraid to Express Ambitions
    Hu Jiao
    In the "Analects," there's a passage recording Confucius and his disciples, Zeng Xi, Zilu, Ran You, and Gongxi Hua, sitting together discussing their ambitions. The old master encouraged his disciples not to be apprehensive and to boldly express their aspirations. After his motivational speech, they all opened up. Some wanted a leisurely life of seclusion, some wanted to study rites and music, and some wanted to be politicians, managing national affairs. The old master listened patiently, nodding in agreement to what he considered right, and merely smiling at what he considered wrong, without reprimanding.
    I believe this spirit and attitude of encouraging students to talk about their ambitions is commendable.
    It shouldn't be a bad thing for a person to set a correct ambition from youth and strive for its realization. However, some people now disagree, saying that cultivating young people's ambitions is an education in individual heroism, incompatible with collectivism and communism, and absolutely unacceptable. According to them, it's best for young people to be "ambitionless," with no personal plans for the future, diligently "being screws in the machine." Although this idea isn't a systematic theory, it's quite popular.
    If you don't believe me, you can visit some high schools or higher education institutions. Just ask young students, "What are your future aspirations?" It's unlikely you'll hear a definite answer. Someone asked the Communist Youth League secretary of a graduating high school class, "What faculty do you want to study at university?" The answer was, "Science and engineering." Asking "Why?" elicited no response. Asking what kind of work they wanted to do in the future, the answer was, "Whatever is needed, I'll do." Asking them to think for themselves, they would say nothing more. Some students are very relaxed about their personal future, feeling that the environment will arrange everything, so there's no need to think too much, as thinking too much can cause trouble. Some students have thoughts in their hearts but dare not speak them, fearing ridicule or being labeled with a big hat, which they couldn't handle. The strangest thing is that some engineering students dare not say they want to be engineers in the future, and agricultural students dare not say they want to be agronomists.
    Admittedly, the desire for fame and success easily mixes with ideas of individual heroism, which requires education. Educators bear a dual task: to cultivate experts and to overcome individual heroism. The difficulty is real, but trying to lump the dual tasks together, forbidding even the ambition for success in order to overcome individual heroism, makes things much easier, but also terribly muddled. If this muddled thinking is allowed to spread, can we even imagine the future of our motherland's scientific development?

    不敢言志
    胡椒
    “论语”上有一段文章记载着孔子和他的几个门人曾皙、子路、冉有、公西华围坐谈志。老夫子鼓励他的门人不要有顾虑，大胆谈出自己的志愿。经了他的一番思想动员，于是都谈开了。有的想过隐居的闲适生活，有的想学制礼作乐，有的想当政治家，管理国家大事。老夫子耐心听着，讲对了点一点头，表示赞同，讲不对的也只笑一笑，不加斥责。
    这种鼓励学生谈志的精神和态度，我以为是可取的。
    一个人从青年时代起，就立下了一个正确的志向并且为它的实现而发奋努力，这总不见得是坏事罢。可是现在有些人很不以为然，说，培养青年立志是一种个人英雄主义的教育，这是与集体主义，共产主义的教育不相容的，绝对要不得。照他们看，青年最好是“无志”，没有丝毫个人前途的打算，切切实实“当螺丝钉”。这套想法虽还不成系统的理论，却也相当流行。
    你若不信，不妨到一些高中以上的学校去走访一遭。随便问一问青年同学：“你将来的志愿怎样？”大概很难听到确定的答案。有人问某高中毕业班的团支书：“你愿考大学什么科？”答说：“理工”。问再“为什么？”就答不上来。再问他将来想干什么工作，答说：“需要什么，就干什么？”再要他自己想，他就不说了。有的学生对个人的前途很放心，反正环境会给安排好的，无需去瞎想，想多了容易出事。有的学生，心有所想，口不敢言，怕说出来之后惹人讥笑或被扣上大帽子，吃不消。最奇怪的是有些工学院的学生不敢说将来要当工程师，农学院的学生不敢讲将来要当农学家。
    诚然，成名、成家的想法是容易夹杂个人英雄主义的想法的，这正需要教育。教育者，肩负着双重的任务：又要培养专家，又要克服个人英雄主义。困难是困难的，可是要想把双重任务捏成一团搅，为了克服个人英雄主义，连成家的志向也不许有，这样做，事情当然好办得多，可也就糊涂得可怕了。倘使让这种糊涂思想泛滥开去，祖国的科学发展前途还能设想吗？
