Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, 18th: Zhejiang Province's production of medicinal materials this year has increased significantly compared to last year. According to statistics from the Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative, the total value of medicinal materials purchased in the first half of this year increased by 400,000 yuan compared to the same period last year, and the variety of medicinal materials purchased also increased by nearly 200 types compared to the same period last year.

The planting area of ​​famous Chinese medicines produced in Zhejiang Province, such as Atractylodes macrocephala, Fritillaria thunbergii, Corydalis yanhusuo, Ophiopogon japonicus, Citrus medica, and Atractylodes lancea, has expanded this year compared to last year. The tonic medicine Atractylodes macrocephala has been in short supply in the past. After the planting area was expanded this year, it can increase production by more than 30,000 dan compared to last year, which can meet the needs of the national market.

The output of wild medicinal materials in this province is also quite abundant. Nearly 200 kinds of wild medicinal materials are produced throughout the province, but in the past few people mined them. This year, agricultural cooperatives in various places have actively mobilized members to go to the mountains to mine medicinal materials in the development of diversified economies. Agricultural cooperatives in mountainous or semi-mountainous areas such as Jiande, Jinhua, and Ningbo have also established special medicinal material production groups. Jinshui Agricultural Cooperative in Qingtian County mobilized its members to mine more than 100 kinds of wild medicinal materials on the mountains, and their income has increased significantly.

    浙江药材产量比去年增多
    新华社杭州18日电　浙江省今年药材生产比去年增加很多。据省供销合作社统计，今年上半年收购药材的总金额比去年同期增加四十万元，收购的药材品种也比去年同期增加了近两百种。
    浙江省出产的著名中药白术、浙贝、元胡、麦冬、佛手、于术等，今年种植面积都比去年扩大了。补药白术过去历年来都供不应求，今年种植面积扩大后，能比去年增产三万多担，可以满足全国市场需要。
    这个省野生药材的产量也相当丰富，全省出产近二百多种野生药材，但是过去很少有人挖掘，今年各地农业社在发展多种经济中，都积极发动社员上山挖掘药材。建德、金华、宁波等山区或半山区的农业社，还专门成立了药材生产小组。青田县锦水农业社发动社员到山上挖掘了一百多种野生药材，收入有显著增加。
