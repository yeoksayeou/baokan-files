    Cold-Hearted People
    Hong Yuping
    On June 27th, Guangming Daily exposed a heartbreaking incident: Yu Youxing, a student at Tianjin Industrial School, was reportedly disliked by his homeroom teacher, Zhang Zhaozhong, because his academic performance was poor and he "damaged" the "honor" of the collective class. On June 8th of last year, Yu Youxing was five minutes late for class, and Zhang Zhaozhong first punished him with confinement, then interfered with his freedom of correspondence and beat him. Finally, he fabricated charges and, through a temporary school affairs meeting, made a decision to force him to leave the school, ultimately driving him insane!

    A few days ago, China Youth Daily (May 27th) also exposed the incident of bad elements such as Ji Yunmao of the Tianjin Joint Public-Private Yongyuande Weaving Factory forcing young worker Si Baorui into insanity. It is evident that such bad people and bad deeds are not entirely nonexistent today.

    That they exist is not surprising, because even in communist society, there will still be contradictions between good and bad people. What is strange is: why do the leaders of the organs, factories, and schools where these events occur turn a blind eye to these bad people and bad deeds, which are plainly in front of them, and remain indifferent? Before Yu Youxing, a student at Tianjin Industrial School, was driven insane, didn't many students witness him being robbed of his letters and beaten? After he was beaten, didn't the personnel cadre and the secretary of the Communist Youth League take him to the League committee dormitory? Then, what reason is there to defend that the relevant leaders of this school ordered Yu Youxing to leave the school because they didn't understand the situation and mistakenly listened to Zhang Zhaozhong's lies? Is it possible that this lawless Zhang Zhaozhong could single-handedly conceal everything from the eyes and ears of all the leaders in the school? The Si Baorui incident is also like this. The Tianjin Hongqiao District Committee of the Communist Youth League heard as early as last year that Si Baorui was mentally disturbed because of "love problems" and being attacked, but for a year, they never inquired about it!

    Our country has a heroic saying: "Draw your sword to help when you see injustice on the road!" In our new society, people who want to "help" when they see "injustice" don't even need to "draw" their "swords," because the people already have their own government and legal system. As long as they step forward and speak out righteously, most problems can be solved. Especially for leading workers, as long as they have a little sense of justice and speak a few fair words, they can prevent bad people from wantonly doing evil, or at least prevent tragic consequences from happening.

    However, unfortunately, some people, especially certain high-ranking leaders, simply do not have even the most basic sense of justice! Although they usually say "serve the people" and "care about the masses," once the masses really need their "care," they invariably use various excuses, such as "still don't understand the situation," "need to consider carefully," "must persuade and educate," etc., ignoring the life and death of the victims, repeatedly condoning and indulging the bad people; thus, the bad people become even more arrogant and lawless, while the good people are wronged for a long time! When the masses report and the truth comes out, they immediately hold up a shield and make a perfunctory self-criticism about "bureaucratism." In fact, people can still glimpse the "true face of Mount Lu" through the shield, and they can still see the "cold heart" hidden behind "bureaucratism"!

    This kind of cold-heartedness is "incompatible" with our new society, which is filled with people caring for each other and comrade-like friendship, and will be condemned by the people!

    As for those scoundrels who blatantly disregard everything and infringe upon human rights, like Ji Yunmao and Zhang Zhaozhong, the issue is not to criticize why their hearts are so rigid, but once they are discovered, our judicial organs must give them the legal sanctions they deserve.

    冷心肠的人
    洪禹平
    六月二十七日光明日报揭发了一个令人痛心的事件：天津市工业学校学生于有兴，据说因为学习成绩不好，“破坏”了集体班的“荣誉”，班主任张肇忠就非常不喜欢他。去年六月八日，于有兴因上课迟到五分钟，张肇忠始则罚以禁闭，继而干涉他的通信自由并加以殴打，最后还捏造罪名通过临时校务会议作出决定，勒令他离校，结果把他逼疯了！
    前些日子，中国青年报（五月二十七日）也揭发过天津公私合营永源德织布厂纪云茂等坏分子逼疯青年工人司宝瑞的事件。可见这类坏人坏事在今天还不是绝无仅有。
    有，是不足为奇的，因为即使到共产主义社会也还会有好人与坏人的矛盾。奇怪的是：为什么发生这类事件的机关，工厂和学校的领导者对于这类明明摆在眼面前的坏人坏事却熟视无睹，处之泰然？天津市工业学校学生于有兴被逼疯之前，不是有许多学生亲眼看见他被抢去信并被殴打的吗？被打之后，人事干部和团委书记不是把他带到团委宿舍去了吗？那末，有什么理由可以辩解说，这个学校的有关领导者是因为不了解情况误听了张肇忠的谎言，而勒令于有兴离校的；难道说，这个无法无天的张肇忠竟能一手遮尽学校中所有领导者的耳目吗？司宝瑞事件也是这样的，青年团天津市红桥区委早在去年就听说司宝瑞因为“恋爱问题”和受打击而神经失常，但一年来就从来没有过问一下！
    我国有一句洋溢着英雄气概的名言：“路见不平，拔刀相助！”在我们新社会里，见“不平”而欲“相助”的人当然连“刀”都无需“拔”，因为人民已经有自己的政权和法制，只要挺身而出，仗义执言，大都可以解决问题，尤其是领导工作人员，只要稍有正义感，出来说几句公道话，就可以使坏人不敢肆无忌惮地为非作歹，至少也可以使惨痛的后果得以避免。
    然而不幸得很，有些人，特别是某些高高在上的领导者，就是连起码的正义感都没有！尽管他们平时也口口声声说“为人民服务”、“关心群众”，但一旦当群众真的需要他们“关心”的时候，他们却偏偏用各种各样的借口，什么“还不了解情况”啦，“需要慎重考虑”啦，“必须说服教育”啦等等，不顾被害者的死活，对坏人百般姑息，一再纵容；于是，坏人更加目中无人，无法无天，好人则长期含冤莫白！等到群众一检举，事情水落石出之时，他们立即举着盾牌，不关痛痒地检讨一下“官僚主义”。其实，人们透过盾牌还是可以窥见“庐山真面目”，还是可以看到在“官僚主义”的后面隐藏着的“冷心肠”！
    这种冷心肠，与我们这个到处充满着人对人的关怀，充满着同志式的友爱的新社会是“水火不相容”的，会受到人们的斥责！
    至于对于那些悍然不顾一切地侵犯人权的坏蛋，像纪云茂、张肇忠之流，就不是斥责其心肠为什么那样僵冷的问题，而是一经发现，我们的司法机关就必须给以应得的法律制裁。
