European Travel Notes
(18) Milan, a Commercial Center
　　
Venice has preserved an ancient city intact. It is said that any house repair plan in Venice must be approved by the Public Education Department before construction can begin. But Milan is a completely modern city. It can be said to be the Italian city with the fewest ancient cultural relics preserved. But the famous Milan Cathedral is said to be one of the three largest cathedrals in the world. This stone-built church does not appear so spectacular from the outside, perhaps because some buildings are crowded around it.

　　But if we enter the interior of this church, with its ceiling so high that one can only look up, and the pictures on the stained glass windows so beautiful that one dare not look directly at them, and if we think of the simple technical conditions of the building hundreds of years ago, we will be even more amazed at the greatness of the people's creativity.

　　Milan's museum has a good collection, but during the war, the main hall and courtyard were bombed. The rebuilt hall is all in the same form as in the past. The people of Milan hung the photos taken when it was bombed into ruins in the most conspicuous place. It is said that the US Air Force only damaged the museum when the last world war was about to end. No wonder the Italian people feel so indignant about this, and even foreign tourists cannot help but feel regret when they see that such beautiful Renaissance columns, courtyards, halls, ceilings... have all been rebuilt.

　　Milan's famous opera house is on holiday, but the building of this theater called "La Scala" is world-renowned. This is one of the few largest opera houses in the world, and several thousand spectators can clearly hear the singers' singing no matter where they are sitting.

    欧游散记
    十八〕商业中心的米兰
    威尼斯是把一个古代城市完整地保存下来了。据说，威尼斯城的任何房屋的修理计划必须经过公共教育部批准才能动工。但米兰却完全是一个现代化的城市。这可以说是意大利城市中保有古代文化遗迹最少的地方。但有名的米兰大教堂，据说是世界上三个最大的教堂之一。这个用石头建成的教堂从外部看来并不显得多么壮观，也许是因为周围一些建筑拥在它身边的原故吧。
    但如果我们走进这个教堂的内部，高到令人只能仰望的天花板，美丽得令人不敢逼视的五彩玻璃窗的图画，如果想起这是几百年前的简陋技术条件下的建筑物，便更要令人惊叹人民的创造力的伟大了。
    米兰的博物馆有着不坏的收藏，但在战争时，主厅和庭院被炸。重修的大厅一切都按照过去的形式，米兰人民把被炸成废墟时摄得的照片挂在最引人注意的地方。据说，上一次世界战争已经将要结束的时候，美国空军才把这博物馆炸坏了的。怪不得意大利人民对这件事如此感觉到忿懑，而连外国游客看到这样美丽的文艺复兴时代的廊柱、庭院、大厅、天花板……都是重修了的，也不禁感到遗憾了。
    米兰的著名歌剧院正在休假，但这个叫做“斯卡拉”的剧场的建筑是世界驰名的。这是世界上少数的几个最大的歌剧院之一，而好几千观众无论坐在哪里都能清晰地听到演员的歌唱。
