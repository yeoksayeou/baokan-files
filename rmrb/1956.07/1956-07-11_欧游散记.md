The First Performance of "Romeo and Juliet"

The great French Romantic composer Berlioz once wrote a work in the form of a "song and dance drama": "Romeo and Juliet." This work used a mixed form of opera and ballet, divided into the following sections: 1. Ballet: Duel. 2. Ballet and mezzo-soprano solo: Romeo's Grief. 3. Ballet: Ball. 4. Ballet: Love Scene. 5. Ballet, chorus, and tenor solo: The Queen's Court. 6. Ballet and chorus: Funeral Procession. 7. Ballet: Tomb. 8. Ballet, chorus, and bass solo: Finale. This work has never been staged before, and now a government committee has overseen its first performance. The choreography was collectively created by three choreographers, and in the performance, one can see some traces of a rushed job. Interestingly, this performance does not take place in a theater, but in the open-air courtyard of the Louvre Palace. The palace serves as the backdrop, with wooden stairs and balconies built as part of the palace, and the actors perform on these stairs and balconies.

It should be said that this performance method is unique and gives the performance a more solemn form.

Mime, Music Halls, and More

The performances of the famous French mime artist Marcel Marceau are of great interest to our Chinese artists. He also has a strong love for "Beijing Opera." He always says: "Chinese Beijing Opera is the noble distant relative of French mime. They have many similarities in terms of performance style. However, French mime has declined, while your Beijing Opera has become more prosperous due to the support of the entire nation." Indeed, this talented artist no longer has frequent opportunities to perform alone, although they were originally capable of performing scripts like Gogol's "The Overcoat." When we went to see his performance, he was doing some short skits in a variety show. It seems that this art with a long tradition, preserved in him, is in a very difficult situation.

But near the simple variety show where Marceau performed, there is another kind of entertainment venue called a music hall. What is staged are some short drama-like scenes accompanied by music, and the dancers are semi-nude or completely nude. The ticket prices are probably the highest in Paris, but the smoky hall is packed with people. Of course, it is inevitable that there are some foreign tourists mixed in, whom one encounters everywhere. The photographs hanging at the entrance of these music halls often attract adults and teenagers alike to linger there.

    “柔密欧和幽丽叶”的第一次演出
    法国的伟大浪漫主义作曲家辽士曾经用“歌舞剧”的形式写过一个作品：“柔密欧和幽丽叶”。这个作品用了歌剧和舞剧的混合形式，分为如下的几个段落：一、舞剧：决斗。二、舞剧和女中音独唱：柔密欧的悲伤。三、舞剧：舞会。四、舞剧：爱情的场面。五、舞剧、合唱和男高音独唱：女王的宫廷。六、舞剧和合唱：送葬的行列。七、舞剧：墓室。八、舞剧、合唱和男低音独唱：终场。这个作品从来没有上演过，现在由一个官方委员会主持了首次的演出，编舞是由三位舞剧家集体创作的，在演出上，可以看出临时赶工的某些痕迹。有趣的是这个演出不在剧场内进行，而是在卢夫宫的露天庭院中，宫堡就是布景，用木板搭成的阶梯和阳台作为宫堡的一个部分，演员们就在这些阶梯和阳台上表演。
    应该说，这种演出方法是别致的，也赋予了这个演出以更为庄严的形式。
    哑剧、音乐厅等等
    著名的法国哑剧演员马塞尔·马索的演出对我们中国艺术家说来是极有兴味的。他对“京戏”也有着极强烈的爱好。他总是说：“中国京戏是法国哑剧的高贵的远亲，它们在表现形式上有很多相似之处。但是，法国哑剧已经衰落了，而你们的京戏由于得到整个民族的扶持而更加兴盛起来”。的确，这位有才能的艺术家现在已经没有经常单独演出的机会了，而本来他们是能够演出像果戈里的“外套”这样的剧本的。我们去看他的演出时，他在一个杂耍场子串演一些小节目，看起来，在他身上保存着的这门有着久远传统的艺术已经处于很困难的境地了。
    但是在马索演出的简陋的杂耍场的附近，就有着另外的一种娱乐场所，名字叫做音乐厅。上演的是伴着音乐的一些类似短剧的场面，而舞女是半裸体或者全裸体的。票价恐怕是巴黎最高的了，但烟雾弥漫的厅座里挤满了人。当然，免不了的是其中总夹杂一些到处都会碰见的外国的游客。这种音乐厅门口挂着剧照，经常也吸引着一些成年人和半大孩子们在那里徘徊。
