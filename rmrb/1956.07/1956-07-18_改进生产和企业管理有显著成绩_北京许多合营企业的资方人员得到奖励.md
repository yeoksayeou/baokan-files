Xinhua News Agency, 16th - A person in charge of the Beijing Federation of Industry and Commerce told Xinhua News Agency reporters on the 14th that in recent months, capitalist personnel in joint state-private enterprises across the city have launched socialist competitions together with workers. More than 800 people have made outstanding achievements and have received rewards and commendations from the administrative leadership of their respective enterprises.

Wu Jincui, deputy director of the joint state-private Yushengxiang Electric Motor Factory, and his younger brother Wu Jinqi, successfully trial-produced an absorption refrigerator suitable for use on trains. When this refrigerator is installed on a locomotive, the temperature in the driver's cabin can be reduced from about 45 degrees Celsius to about 31 degrees Celsius when the train passes through a tunnel. Smoke in the cabin can also be removed, so drivers are no longer choked by smoke and unable to see the instruments clearly. Ding Ruiyun, deputy director of the joint state-private paint factory, utilized his technical expertise and, with the support of the public representative, successfully trial-produced recording tape. This recording tape has a loud sound and is comparable to imported goods. Lu Ziyin, manager of Tongji Paper and Stationery Store, added more than 200 kinds of goods according to customer needs. He often takes the initiative to introduce the performance and characteristics of the goods to customers, and was praised by customers 32 times in one month.

    公私合营裕生祥电机厂副厂长吴金萃和他弟弟吴金起，试制成功一种火车上适用的吸收式冷冻机。把这种冷冻机安装在机车上，当火车通过隧道的时候，司机室内的温度可以由摄氏四十五度降低到三十一度左右，室内的烟雾也可以被排除，司机们不再被呛得呼吸困难和看不清仪表了。公私合营油漆厂副厂长丁瑞云，发挥了技术专长，在公方代表支持下，试制录音片成功。这种录音片发音宏亮，可与进口货媲美。同记纸张文具店经理逯子荫，根据顾客需要，增加了二百多种商品，他经常主动向顾客介绍商品性能、特点，有一个月曾受到顾客三十二次表扬。
