Xinhua News Agency, July 24th - A person in charge of the Beijing Municipal Administration for Industry and Commerce announced today that Beijing has decided to fully pay the first and second quarter fixed interest on private shares of joint state-private industrial and commercial enterprises by the end of July or early August. All industrial and commercial enterprises that implemented joint state-private ownership during the 1956 high tide of socialist transformation will generally be paid dividends at an annual interest rate of five percent based on the amount of shares determined by asset verification, starting from January 1st of this year. A small number of enterprises with incomplete verification of some shares can also appropriately pay dividends in advance, and adjustments will be made according to the actual situation after the funds are verified in the future.
The person in charge of the Beijing Municipal Administration for Industry and Commerce announced this decision at a symposium held this morning with the participation of the chairman and members of the Beijing Federation of Industry and Commerce and the district federations of industry and commerce. The person in charge then explained at the meeting that if the fixed interest rate of industrial and commercial enterprises that implemented joint state-private ownership before 1956 exceeded an annual interest rate of five percent, it would be paid as before without reduction; if the fixed interest rate was less than five percent, it would be raised to an annual interest rate of five percent. For enterprises that implemented joint state-private ownership in the fourth quarter of 1955, if the profits after joint operation have not been distributed, the method of fixed interest or "four-horse profit sharing" can be determined through specific consultation between the public and private parties.
Le Songsheng, chairman of the Beijing Federation of Industry and Commerce, and the heads of the district federations of industry and commerce who participated in the symposium spoke generally, supporting this decision and expressing their gratitude to the People's Government for its meticulous care for private industrialists and merchants. They also put forward many good methods on the issue of the first large-scale distribution of fixed interest procedures.
Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, July 24th - The work of distributing the 1955 profits of Shanghai's joint state-private enterprises and private enterprises has come to an end. According to statistics from the Shanghai Municipal Administration for Industry and Commerce as of July 15th, excluding enterprises with unsound accounting books, among the industrial and commercial enterprises that can be distributed according to the principle of "four-horse profit sharing", 7,153 have reached an agreement or begun distributing dividends. These enterprises distributed a total of more than 35.45 million yuan in dividends, accounting for 20.7% of the total book profit, of which private shares received more than 27 million yuan.
While distributing the 1955 surplus, 1,106 households also reissued the 1953 surplus, and 1,158 households reissued the 1954 surplus. Among the reissued surpluses for these two years, private shares received more than 5.5 million yuan.
According to the Bureau of Industry and Commerce's analysis, the number of enterprises distributing the 1955 surplus increased by 74.8% compared to 1953 and 139% compared to 1954. The 1955 surplus distribution amount was also higher than in previous years. The 1953 surplus distribution of private and joint state-private enterprises, including recent re-issuances, was only 32.78 million yuan. In 1954, it was only 11.12 million yuan. For example, the shareholder dividends of the Shenxin system textile factories, which began joint state-private ownership last September, reached more than 910,000 yuan in this distribution, compared to only 630,000 yuan in 1954. The shareholder dividends of the Yong'an system textile factories, which also began joint ownership last September, received more than 1,027,700 yuan, compared to only 568,000 yuan in 1954.

    北京市合营企业发付私股定息
    上海公私合营企业和私营企业分配去年盈余
    本报24日讯　北京市工商管理局负责人今天宣布：北京市已经决定在七月底八月初全部发付公私合营工商企业私股第一、二季度的定息。凡是在1956年社会主义改造高潮中实行公私合营的工商业企业，一般从今年一月一日算起，按照清产核资所确定的股金额发给年利五厘的股息。少数企业部分股金未完全核定，也可以酌量先发股息，等到将来资金核定后按实调整。
    北京市工商管理局负责人是在今天上午举行的有北京市工商联和各区工商联主任委员等参加的座谈会上宣布这一项决定的。负责人在会上接着说明，凡在1956年以前实行公私合营的工商企业，定息利率超过年息五厘的，照旧发付，不予降低；定息利率不到五厘的，提高到年息五厘发付。在1955年第四季度内实行公私合营的企业，如果合营后盈余尚未分配，采用定息或“四马分肥”办法，由公私双方具体协商确定。
    参加这次座谈会的北京市工商联主任委员乐松生和各区的工商联负责人等普遍发言，拥护这一项决定，并对人民政府对于私营工商业者的无微不至的照顾表示感激。他们还就第一次大规模发放定息的手续问题提出了许多很好的办法。
    新华社上海24日电　上海市公私合营企业和私营企业1955年的盈余分配工作已经结束。根据上海市工商行政管理局到七月十五日的统计，除去账册不健全的企业以外，凡是可以按照“四马分肥”的原则进行分配的工商企业，已经有7，153户取得协议或者开始分发红利。这些企业总共分配红利3，545万多元，占账面盈余总额的20.7％，其中私股所得有二千七百多万元。
    在分配1955年盈余的同时，还有1，106户补发1953年度盈余，1，158户补发1954年度盈余。这两个年度的补发盈余中，私股所得有五百五十多万元。
    据工商局分析，分配1955年度盈余的企业，户数比1953年度增加74.8％，比1954年度增加139％。1955年度盈余分配数也比往年高。1953年度私营和公私合营企业盈余分配数包括最近补发数在内只有3，278万元。1954年度只有1，112万元。例如去年九月开始公私合营的申新系统各纺织厂在这次分配中股东红利达九十一万多元，1954年只有六十三万元。也是去年九月开始合营的永安系统各纺织厂股东红利分得一百零二万七千多元，1954年只有五十六万八千元。
