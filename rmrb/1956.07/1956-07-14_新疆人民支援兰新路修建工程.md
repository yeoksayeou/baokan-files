The first group of over 600 farmers of various ethnic groups from the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, supporting the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway construction project, have recently arrived at the construction site of the Hongliuhe to Hami section on the Xinjiang border. The second group of over 7,000 farmers and herdsmen, mobilized by relevant regions under the instruction of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region People's Committee to support the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway construction project, will also start heading to the construction site in batches from the beginning of August, so as to start construction of the subgrade engineering of the section from Hongliuhe on the Xinjiang border to Hami in early September.

Thousands of tons of materials have now been concentrated in the Hami area; batches of trucks fully loaded with flour, vegetables, lump coal, and timber are heading from Hami to construction sites along the railway east of Hami every day. The Hami Prefectural Logging Company has prepared more than 20,000 cubic meters of construction timber, and began supplying it to various construction areas from the beginning of July. The northern forest area in the central section of the Tianshan Mountains will also prepare more than 100,000 cubic meters of construction timber by the end of this year for construction along the railway west of Urumqi. Farmers in many areas along the railway are also preparing to open up several thousand mu of vegetable gardens and increase vegetable planting in order to supply food for the railway construction workers.

    新疆人民支援兰新路修建工程
    据新华社乌鲁木齐13日电　新疆维吾尔自治区第一批支援兰新铁路修建工程的各族农民六百多人，最近已经到达新疆边境红柳河至哈密段的工地。由新疆维吾尔自治区人民委员会指示有关地区动员的第二批支援兰新铁路修建工程的七千多名农牧民，也将从八月初开始陆续前往工地，以便在九月初分段开工修建从新疆边境红柳河至哈密段的路基工程。
    现在哈密地区已经集中了成千上万吨物资；每天都有成批满载面粉、蔬菜、块煤、木材的汽车，从哈密开往哈密以东的铁路沿线工地。哈密专区伐木公司备妥的两万多立方公尺建筑木材，从七月上旬就开始供应各个建筑区。天山中段北部林区，到今年年底还将准备十几万立方公尺的建筑木材，供给乌鲁木齐以西铁路沿线建筑使用。铁路沿线许多地区的农民还准备新开辟几千亩菜园，增植蔬菜，以便供应筑路民工食用。
