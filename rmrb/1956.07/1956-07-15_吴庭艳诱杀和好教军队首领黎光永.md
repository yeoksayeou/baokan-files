Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, July 14th: Saigon dispatch: Ngo Dinh Diem authorities executed Le Quang Vinh, leader of the Hoa Hao army, with a guillotine in Can Tho, southwest of Saigon, on July 12th.

Le Quang Vinh, nicknamed Ba Cut, was captured by Ngo Dinh Diem's army in April of this year. The thousands of troops he led once posed a significant threat to the Ngo Dinh Diem regime. In order to eliminate this opposition army, Ngo Dinh Diem mobilized a large number of American-equipped troops to conduct a long-term encirclement and suppression in the western region of South Vietnam.

According to Saigon sources, Ngo Dinh Diem used a conspiracy to capture Le Quang Vinh. Before capturing Le Quang Vinh, Ngo Dinh Diem sent people to negotiate ceasefire terms with him. During the negotiation process, Ngo Dinh Diem set a trap, ambushing troops and secret agents, and captured the unsuspecting Le Quang Vinh and his entourage.

After Le Quang Vinh's capture, scattered Hoa Hao armed forces continued to operate in western Vietnam.

    吴庭艳诱杀和好教军队首领黎光永
    据新华社河内14日电　西贡消息：吴庭艳当局七月十二日在西贡西南的芹苴用断头机处决了和好教军队的首领黎光永。
    绰号三断（即巴卡特）的黎光永是在今年四月间被吴庭艳军队俘获的。他率领的几千名军队曾经给吴庭艳政权以很大的威胁。为了肃清这支反对派的军队，吴庭艳曾经出动了大量美国装备的军队在南越的西部地区进行长期的围剿。
    据西贡的消息透露，吴庭艳是用阴谋捕获黎光永的。在捉住黎光永以前，吴庭艳曾经派人同他谈判停战条件。在谈判过程中，吴庭艳就设下圈套，埋伏好军队和特务人员，把没有防备的黎光永和他的随从人员抓住了。
    在黎光永被捕后，零星的和好教武装继续在越南西部活动。
