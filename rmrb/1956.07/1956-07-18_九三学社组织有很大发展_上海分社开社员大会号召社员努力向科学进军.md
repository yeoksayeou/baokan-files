Xinhua News Agency, 16th: The organization of the Jiu San Society has recently seen significant development. From the time the Jiu San Society convened its First National Congress of Members in February, to the end of June, the number of members developed in the four months was four and a half times the total number of members developed in the two years from 1953 to 1955. This was announced yesterday by Xue Yu, Deputy Director of the Organization Department of the Jiu San Society, at the third meeting of the Central Standing Committee of the Jiu San Society.

Among the newly developed members, assistant researchers, attending physicians, and lecturers or above account for more than 96%, some of whom are well-known academics, such as medical scientist Yan Fuqing, physicist Gui Zhitin, writers Feng Yuanjun and Liu Wendian, geologist Xie Jiarong, astronomer Zhang Yuzhe, economist Qin Zan, and psychologist Sun Guohua, and others.

In these four months, the Jiu San Society also formally established a branch in Chengdu; and established central directly affiliated groups in Kunming, Tangshan, and Guangzhou.

Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 16th: The Shanghai Branch of the Jiu San Society held a membership meeting on the 15th.

Lu Yudao, Chairman of the Shanghai Branch of the Jiu San Society, said at the meeting that this conference was held after the Chinese Communist Party put forward the policy of long-term coexistence and mutual supervision between the Chinese Communist Party and other democratic parties, and the "Hundred Schools of Thought Contend" policy was implemented in academics. He called on members to strive to continue to consolidate and expand the people's democratic united front and to enable China's science to rapidly catch up with the world's advanced levels.

Da Yijin, Deputy Chairman of the Shanghai Branch of the Jiu San Society, gave a work report on the branch's work over the past three years. He said that the Shanghai Branch of the Jiu San Society currently has 322 members, of whom 70% are natural science workers and 20% are social science workers. In the first half of this year, the branch developed 169 new members, a figure exceeding the total developed in the past three years. The branch has now established fifteen grassroots organizations, and five more are about to be established. He pointed out that in the future, under the leadership and supervision of the Chinese Communist Party, the Shanghai Branch of the Jiu San Society should reflect the opinions of the intellectual circles more and represent their reasonable demands; promote members and the masses they contact to actively participate in free academic debates and advance towards science; and while actively developing the organization, strengthen ideological education and theoretical study.

At the meeting, Mao Qishuang and 26 others were elected as members of the Fifth Committee of the Shanghai Branch of the Jiu San Society.

    上海分社开社员大会号召社员努力向科学进军
    新华社16日讯　九三学社的组织最近有了很大发展。从今年二月九三学社召开第一届全国社员代表大会起，到六月底止的四个月内，发展的社员为1953到1955年两年内发展社员总数的四倍半。这是九三学社组织部副部长薛愚昨天在九三学社的中央常务委员会第三次会议上宣布的。
    新发展的社员中，助理研究员、主治医师和讲师以上的占96％以上，其中有些是著名的学术工作者，如医学家颜福庆，物理学家桂质庭，文学家冯沅君、刘文典，地质学家谢家荣，天文学家张钰哲，经济学家秦瓒和心理学家孙国华等。
    在这四个月中，九三学社还在成都正式成立了分社；在昆明、唐山、广州建立了中央直属小组。
    新华社上海16日电　九三学社上海分社十五日举行了社员大会。
    九三学社上海分社主任委员卢于道在会上说，这次大会是在中国共产党提出和各民主党派长期共存、互相监督并在学术上贯彻“百家争鸣”的方针后举行的。他号召社员们为继续巩固与扩大人民民主统一战线和使中国科学迅速赶上世界先进水平而奋斗。
    九三学社上海分社副主任委员笪移今作了分社三年来工作报告。他说，九三学社上海分社现有社员322人，其中自然科学工作者占70％，社会科学工作者占20％。今年上半年内分社发展了169个新社员，这个数字超过过去三年发展的总和。分社现在已经建立了十五个基层组织，即将建立的还有五个。他指出，九三学社上海分社今后要在中国共产党的领导和监督下，更多地反映知识界的意见并代表其合理要求；推动社员和所联系的群众踊跃参加学术上的自由论争，向科学进军；在积极发展组织的同时，加强思想教育和理论学习。
    会上选出了毛启爽等二十七人为九三学社上海分社第五届委员会委员。
