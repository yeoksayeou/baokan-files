    Called for a Thousand Times, But Still Doesn't Come Out
    ——Opinions on New Product Production and Promotion
    As early as the first half of last year, newspapers reported that the Shanghai Industrial Experiment Institute of the Ministry of Light Industry had successfully trial-produced a hearing aid for deaf patients. This news was truly exciting. Xia Yuzhong, a worker at the Qinghe Woolen Mill in Beijing, has a child with an ear problem. After seeing this news, he inquired everywhere, wanting to buy one, but never managed to find it.
    In March and April of this year, Xinhua News Agency issued two news reports, stating that the Guangzhou Joint State-Private Tongji Instrument Manufacturing Factory had also successfully trial-produced a hearing aid and that small-scale production could begin in the second quarter. Newsreels also featured it. On May 25th, the editors of China Youth Daily, in answering a reader's letter, even told people that to buy a hearing aid, they could contact and order from local pharmaceutical companies.
    Recently, our pharmaceutical company has received many letters from the people requesting to order this hearing aid. However, after contacting relevant parties, the two types of hearing aids mentioned above have not yet been produced. According to the Guangzhou Tongji Instrument Manufacturing Factory, no one can say for sure when hearing aids can be produced because: 1. The main component – small-sized vacuum tubes – must be imported, but no plan has been submitted to foreign countries to date; 2. The required batteries have not been resolved. The only set of samples uses batteries that are twice the size of the hearing aid, making it unusable.
    Therefore, we have the following suggestions for newspapers and news agencies: It is right to publicize the successful trial production of new products, but if there is no certainty, do not estimate when production can begin. Because production involves many issues, such as equipment, raw materials, and working hours, problems often arise. If an "estimate" is made, and it cannot be realized at the time, it will reduce the effectiveness of the report and put the production and sales departments in a passive position.
    In addition, there is also an opinion for the industrial departments: Although there is a process from the successful trial assembly of a new product to formal production, all industrial departments should try their best to shorten this process to meet the people's need for new products.

### 千呼万唤不出来——对新产品生产和宣传工作的意见

    千呼万唤不出来
    ——对新产品生产和宣传工作的意见
    远在去年上半年，报纸上就曾报道过轻工业部上海工业试验所试制成功了一种供耳聋患者使用的耳聋助听器，这个消息真使人兴奋。北京清河制呢厂的工人夏玉钟有一个小孩耳朵有毛病，看到了这个消息，到处打听，想购买一只，但是一直没有买到。
    今年三、四月间，新华社又先后发出两条新闻，报道广州市公私合营同济仪器制造厂又试制成功了一种耳聋助听器，并且说第二季度就能开始小量生产。新闻纪录影片中也作过介绍。五月二十五日，中国青年报的编者在答复读者来信的时候，还告诉人家要买耳聋助听器可到各地医药公司联系订购。
    最近，我们医药公司就接到很多人民来信，要订购这种耳聋助听器。但是经我们同有关方面联系，上面说的两种耳聋助听器都还没有生产。据广州同济仪器制造厂说，究竟何时能生产耳聋助听器，谁也肯定不了，因为：一、其中主要部件——小规格的真空管必须进口，但是到现在还没有向国外提计划；二、所需电池一直没有解决，仅有的一套样品所用的电池也比助听器大一倍，实在不堪使用。
    因此，我们对报纸、通讯社有这样的意见：对新产品试制成功进行宣传是对的，但是如果没有十分把握，就不要预计何时能生产。因为生产上牵涉的问题很多，如设备、原料、工时等，时常会发生问题。如果“预计”了，到时不能实现，就会降低报道的作用，使生产和销售部门的工作陷于被动。
    另外，对工业部门也有一个意见：一种新产品从试装成功到正式生产，这中间虽然有一个过程，但是各个工业部门应该尽可能地来缩短这个过程，满足人民对新产品的需要。　　中国医药公司　孙民友
