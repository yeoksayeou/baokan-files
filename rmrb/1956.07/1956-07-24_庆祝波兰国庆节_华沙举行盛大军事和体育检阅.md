Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, July 23rd: A grand military and sports parade was held in Warsaw on July 22nd—Polish National Day.

Early in the morning, many Warsaw citizens gathered along more than a dozen streets leading to the Palace of Culture and Science. The stands around Stalin Square in front of the Palace of Culture and Science were packed with over 30,000 spectators. Two large slogans were hung high opposite the rostrum: "Strengthen the unbreakable connection between the Party and the working class with all the people!" and "Strive for greater democratization in all aspects of our lives!"

On the rostrum were Polish United Workers' Party and government leaders Ochab, Zawadzki, Cyrankiewicz, and others, as well as Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union Bulganin, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister of the German Democratic Republic Bolz, heads of various diplomatic missions and military attachés, and trade union delegations from various countries.

The parade began at exactly 10:00 a.m. After Polish Minister of National Defense, Marshal of Poland Rokossovsky inspected the troops, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Polish People's Republic, Cyrankiewicz, delivered a speech. He briefly described the achievements of the Polish people in the struggle against fascism and in building their motherland, and then said: We salute all fraternal people's democratic countries. The cooperation, unity, and mutual assistance between the countries of the peace camp, the Soviet Union, great China, and the various people's democratic countries are the foundation of victory in the struggle for socialism, our security, and our development. We salute all countries that desire peace and international cooperation.

Following this, the military parade began. As the neat formations passed in front of the rostrum, several squadrons of twin-engine jet bombers and jet fighters roared overhead, the sound deafening. After the military parade, strong sports teams then passed through the square. The number plates they held high indicated that Polish athletes had set 322 new national records in 1955.

    庆祝波兰国庆节 
    华沙举行盛大军事和体育检阅
    据新华社华沙23日电　华沙在二十二日——波兰国庆日——举行了盛大的军事和体育检阅。
    一清早，许多华沙市民就沿着十几条通向文化科学宫的大街汇集在一起，在文化科学宫前的斯大林广场四周的观礼台上，密集着三万多观礼的人。主席台对面高高地悬挂着两幅大字标语：“加强党和工人阶级同全体人民的牢不可破的联系！”、“为我们生活各方面的更加民主化而斗争！”
    在主席台上，有波兰统一工人党和政府领导人奥哈布、萨瓦茨基、西伦凯维兹等，还有苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁、民主德国副总理兼外交部长博尔茨、各外交使团的首长和武官和各国工会代表团等。
    十时正检阅开始。波兰国防部长、波兰元帅罗科索夫斯基检阅部队以后，波兰人民共和国部长会议主席西伦凯维兹接着讲话。他简要地叙述了波兰人民在反法西斯和建设祖国的斗争中取得的成就后说：我们向所有兄弟人民民主国家致敬。和平阵营国家、苏联、伟大的中国和各人民民主国家之间的合作、团结和互助，是争取社会主义、我们的安全和我们的发展的斗争中的胜利的基础。我们向所有希望和平和国际合作的国家致敬。
    接着，举行了阅兵式。整齐的队伍通过主席台前的时候，几中队双引擎的喷气轰炸机和喷气战斗机从上空掠过，隆隆之声，震耳欲聋。检阅结束后，健壮的体育队伍接着通过了广场。他们高举的数字牌表明波兰运动员们在1955年创造了322项全国新纪录。
