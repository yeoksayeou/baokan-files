A Brief Discussion on "Letting a Hundred Flowers Bloom"
By Our Staff Commentator

Currently, people in China's academic and cultural circles are discussing the policy of "Letting a Hundred Flowers Bloom and a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend." Many thoughts and opinions have already been published in newspapers and magazines. Judging from these responses, most people warmly support this policy, but there are still disputes, doubts, and concerns on certain issues.

What are the disputes about? Mainly the requirements and interpretations of "contending." Some say that since it is a hundred "schools" contending, one must first establish a school before being qualified to contend. Some say that not only must one contend, but one must contend well. Others enthusiastically hope that contenders will be like orchestral musicians, unified under a conductor. Still others disagree with this view, considering it a restriction.

We believe that "contending well" is a reasonable hope, but it should not be regarded as a restriction. As long as the overall effect of the hundred schools of thought contending is to promote academic prosperity and cultural progress, that is "good." However, it is natural for the overall "good" to include some "not good." Only through the process of contention can we achieve "good" overcoming "not good" and "good" developing into "better." Contention is neither a unison nor a chorus, so discordant notes are bound to appear. The various schools of thought should create their own musical pieces, rather than performing according to the musical pieces specified by the orchestra conductor. As long as the tune he plays is not counter-revolutionary, he has the freedom to contend. We have only one requirement for contenders: to truly engage in academic research, and not, as Engels criticized, understand the freedom of science as "people can write anything they have not studied." As long as one has done serious research, speaks with reason, and has evidence, then those who have established schools can contend, and those who have not can also contend; great figures can contend, and small figures can also contend; it is welcome to contend well, and it does not matter if one does not contend well. Many people have suggested that contention should not be "random," but the interpretation of what is "random" varies from person to person. In fact, since it is to "contend," it cannot be absolutely "not random." If "random" refers to "diverse opinions" or "novel arguments," this kind of "random" may not be bad; only the kind of "random" that is without any research and is spoken off the cuff is what we do not take. Arguments that are unreasonable and without evidence will inevitably have no listeners.

Whether "Letting a Hundred Flowers Bloom" can be implemented in university teaching is also one of the disputed issues. Our opinion is that schools of thought are mainly formed in universities, and university students should also have a certain ability to think independently. In order to encourage the formation of schools of thought and cultivate students' ability to think independently, different opinions can be taught in the classroom. Of course, there are still some specific issues that need further research.

Finally, there is the issue of the status of Marxism in the contention of a hundred schools of thought. Some people believe that "contention should be based on Marxism," "should use dialectical materialism as the standard for judging right and wrong," "should use Marxism as a guiding ideology," and so on. Marxism is the guiding ideology of our national activities and cultural science; this has already been determined. However, in academic issues and in scientific research, if someone does not adopt the method of dialectical materialism or reaches conclusions that are inconsistent with Marxism, he still has the right to express his own views. Therefore, whether to base it on Marxism or use it as a standard for judging right and wrong is up to each individual. We advocate dialectical materialism, and we encourage everyone to learn and apply the viewpoints and methods of dialectical materialism, but we also advocate that others have the freedom to doubt and criticize dialectical materialism, just as we have the right to criticize non-dialectical materialistic ideas. If it is stipulated that it must be based on or judged by materialism, then it is actually depriving idealists of the qualification to contend. Disputes can occur between Marxists, between Marxists and friends of Marxism, and even between Marxists and idealists. These different disputes each have different foundations and cannot be forced to be the same.

The suspicion of "Letting a Hundred Flowers Bloom" mainly lies in two issues: First, why should we let idealism come out? Will this cause ideological confusion? Second, does this practice mean that the Party has given up leadership? To the first question, we say: There is no need to be afraid that idealism will gain power, and there is no need to be afraid that it will cause confusion in the ideological field. We believe in the power of the truth of Marxism, so we do not believe that the result of contention will damage Marxism. On the contrary, contention will greatly benefit the development of Marxism. Marxism originally grew and strengthened in the struggle against idealism. We should use the power of theory to refute idealistic ideas, and we do not need to use administrative means to protect materialism. To the second question, we say: Consciously implementing the policy of "Letting a Hundred Flowers Bloom" put forward by the Party in academic, cultural, and ideological fields is the realization of the Party's leadership. This is one. Our academic contention is based on political unity. Contention does not exclude common planning and cooperation in scientific undertakings. This is two. The principle that Marxism is the leading ideology in academic and cultural circles has been established. The Party's leadership over academic and cultural affairs is to lead with Marxist ideas. This is three.

Concerns about "contending" mainly stem from some people's fear of making mistakes, especially fear of making idealist mistakes and turning into political issues. This has objective reasons. We once criticized the bourgeois idealism of the Hu Shi and Hu Feng factions. This criticism adopted a fierce, revealing, and movement-based form, because Hu Shi and Hu Feng were our ideological and political enemies. This is only one form of ideological criticism, but many people misunderstand it as the only form, and also misunderstand that any idealist thought is a political issue. In addition, under the influence of authority worship and dogmatism, a simplified and rude criticism has also grown in recent years.

A healthy and normal attitude towards criticism is welcomed by everyone. At present, China's academic and cultural circles are still not very accustomed to criticism, and have not yet regarded public criticism as something as common and necessary as sweeping the floor and washing one's face. As soon as someone is criticized in newspapers and magazines, it is terrible. Others think that this person is "finished," and he himself thinks he is "finished." In fact, if the criticism is wrong, he can refute it and debate it; if the criticism is correct, then accepting the criticism will never mean he is "finished."

For some people who are afraid of criticism, we must also say that "contention" itself includes mutual criticism. No one can have the privilege of not being criticized. The problem is not to oppose criticism, but to oppose rude, unreasonable, and random labeling criticism. Whether in research work or academic criticism, we must advocate a realistic and scientific attitude.

No matter how great the achievements of scientific progress are today, compared with the future history of mankind as a whole, our knowledge is still in a very naive stage. Every scientific department now has many difficult problems waiting to be solved, and countless new problems will continue to emerge in the future. An academic worker who wants to make a creative contribution must bravely step into those unknown areas and explore unfamiliar paths. He may further uncover the secrets of nature and society here, but he may also be confused by a large number of new problems, lose his way in the tortuous process of understanding, and fall into the quagmire of idealism. In any era, even in the era of communist society, everyone's understanding cannot but be limited by historical conditions. Marxists can completely get rid of the limitations of class prejudice, but they still cannot completely get rid of the limitations of other conditions. Things are not as simple as some people imagine, thinking that once they have learned the principle of the primary nature of matter and the secondary nature of consciousness, they will never make the mistake of idealism again, or that as long as they enter a communist society, idealism can be eliminated.

The policy of "Letting a Hundred Flowers Bloom" is not sudden. Our constitution stipulates freedom of speech, publication, and scientific research. "Letting a Hundred Flowers Bloom" is only a further development and concretization of this provision.

In history, we had the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods, a time of academic prosperity and the contention of a hundred schools of thought, and we also had the May Fourth period of ideological liberation and rational awakening. Today we are in an unprecedentedly great era, and we should have the ambition to create an unprecedentedly prosperous culture. Our current academic foundation is very weak, but our social system provides the material conditions and freedom for scientific research—real freedom for the people and for the truth. This is the most powerful guarantee for the development of academia. This kind of freedom is not enjoyed by scientists in capitalist countries. The truth and the interests of the working class are completely consistent. Engels said, "The more courageously and resolutely science advances, the more it conforms to the interests and aspirations of the workers." This is the objective basis for the development of science under the socialist system.

Under the great goal of striving for socialism, people in cultural and scientific circles unite, contribute their talents and wisdom, and the broad masses also pour into the ranks of advancing towards culture and science, forming a magnificent and brilliant picture. "Appearing in the world as a nation with a high level of culture" (Mao Zedong). —This is the socialist cultural upsurge in our minds.

    略论“百家争鸣”  
    本报评论员
    目前，我国学术文化界人士正在讨论“百家争鸣”的方针，报纸杂志上已经发表了许多感想和意见。从这些反应看来，大多数人是热烈拥护这个方针的，但是，在某些问题上，也还是有争论，有怀疑，有顾虑。
    争论什么？主要是对“争鸣”的要求和解释问题。有人说，既然是百“家”争鸣，可见首先要成家，不成家的没有资格鸣。有人说，不仅要鸣，还要鸣得好。还有人热心地希望争鸣者像演奏管弦乐一样，统一于一个指挥。另外有些人不同意这种提法，认为这是限制。
    我们认为，“鸣得好”是一种合理的希望，但不必当作一种限制。只要百家争鸣的总的效果是促进了学术繁荣，推动了文化进步，那就是“好”。但是在总的“好”之中包含部分的“不好”，那也是自然的。要使“好”克服“不好”，使“好”发展到“更好”，这只有通过争鸣的过程才能实现。争鸣既不是齐唱，也不是合唱，因此必然会出现不和谐音。诸子百家应该自己去创作乐曲，而不是按照乐队指挥所指定的乐曲来演奏。只要他奏出来的曲调不是反革命的，他就有争鸣的自由。我们对争鸣者只有一个要求，就是要真正作学术研究，不要像恩格斯批评过的那样，把科学的自由了解成“人们可以撰写一切他们所不曾研究过的东西”。只要是认真作过研究，言之成理，持之有故，那么，成家的可以鸣，不成家的也可以鸣，大人物可以鸣，小人物也可以鸣，鸣得好固然欢迎，鸣得不好也没有关系。很多人都提出，争鸣不是“乱鸣”，但什么是“乱鸣”，各人的解释却并不一致。其实，既然要“争”，就不能绝对“不乱”。如果“乱鸣”指的是“众说纷纭”，或者“立论新奇”，这种“乱鸣”未必是坏的；只有那种毫无研究，信口开河的“乱鸣”，才是我们所不取的。言之不成理，持之无故的议论，必然没有听众。
    关于高等学校的教学中能不能实行“百家争鸣”，也是争论的问题之一。我们的意见是：学派主要是在大学里形成的，大学生也是应该有一定的独立思考的能力的，为了鼓励学派的形成和培养学生的独立思考的能力，不同的意见是可以在课堂中讲授的。自然，这里面还有些具体问题，需要作进一步的研究。
    最后还有马克思主义在百家争鸣中的地位问题。有些人认为，“争鸣要以马克思主义为基础”，“要以辩证唯物主义为衡量是非的标准”，“要用马克思主义作为指导思想”，等等。马克思主义是我们国家活动和文化科学的指导思想，这是已经确定的。但是，在学术问题上，在科学研究中，如果有人不采取辩证唯物主义的方法，或达到了和马克思主义不一致的结论，他仍然可以有权发表自己的见解。因此，是不是要以马克思主义为基础或评判是非的标准，那也要看各人自愿。我们是主张辩证唯物主义的，是提倡大家来学习和运用辩证唯物主义的观点和方法的，但是我们也主张别人有怀疑和批评辩证唯物主义的自由，正像我们也有权利批评非辩证唯物主义的思想一样。如果规定必须以唯物主义为基础或标准，那实际上是取消唯心主义者争鸣的资格。争论可以发生在马克思主义者相互之间，也可以发生在马克思主义者和马克思主义的友人之间，还可以发生在马克思主义者和唯心主义者之间，这些不同的争论都各有不同的基础，不能强求一律。
    对于“百家争鸣”的怀疑，主要在两个问题上：一、我们为什么要让唯心主义出来呢？这会不会造成思想混乱呢？二、这种做法是党放弃了领导吧？对于第一个疑问，我们说：用不着害怕唯心主义会得势，用不着害怕会因此造成思想界的混乱。我们相信马克思主义的真理的力量，因此我们就不相信争鸣的结果会损害马克思主义，相反，争鸣会大大有利于马克思主义的发展。马克思主义本来是在和唯心主义作斗争的当中成长壮大起来的。我们应该用理论的力量驳倒唯心主义思想，而不需要用行政手段来保护唯物主义。对于第二个问题，我们说：在学术文化思想各方面有意识地贯彻执行党提出来的“百家争鸣”的方针就是实现了党的领导，这是一。我们的学术上的争鸣是以政治上的团结一致做基础的，争鸣也并不排斥科学事业的共同规划和合作，这是二。马克思主义作为学术文化界的领导思想这一条已经确立，党对学术文化的领导就是用马克思主义的思想来领导的，这是三。
    关于对“争鸣”的顾虑，主要是有人很害怕自己犯错误，特别怕犯唯心论的错误，怕变成政治问题。这是有客观原因的。我们曾经批判过胡适派和胡风派的资产阶级唯心主义，这种批判采用了猛烈的，揭露式的，运动的形式，那是因为胡适和胡风是我们的思想敌人兼政治敌人。这只是思想批判的一种形式，很多人却把它误解成为唯一的形式，同时也误解为一有唯心主义思想就是政治问题。另外，在权威崇拜和教条主义的影响下，近年来也滋长了一种简单化的、粗暴的批评。
    健康的正常的对待批评的态度是人人欢迎的。现在我国的学术文化界还是不十分习惯于批评的，还没有把公开批评看成是像扫地洗脸一样平常和必需的事情。只要某人一旦在报纸杂志上受到了批评，这就不得了，旁人就认为这个人“完了”，他本人也自认为“完了”。其实，如果这批评是错误的话，他尽可以反驳，辩论；如果这批评是正确的话，那么，接受这批评以后，就决不会“完了”。
    对于有些害怕批评的人，我们也要说，“争鸣”本身就包括相互批评在内，任何人也不能有不受批评的特权。问题不在于反对批评，而在于反对粗暴的、不讲道理的、乱扣帽子的批评。不论是在研究工作或者学术批评中，我们都要提倡实事求是的科学的态度。
    不管今天科学的进步有多么大的成就，和整个人类未来的历史比较，我们的知识还是处在很幼稚的阶段。每一个科学部门现在都有许多等待解决的困难问题，将来还会不断出现数不清的新问题。一个想要作出创造性的贡献的学术工作者，就必须勇敢地踏进那些未知的领域，在生疏的道路上探索。他可能在这里进一步揭开自然和社会的秘密，但是也可能为大量的新问题所迷惑，在迂回曲折的认识过程中迷失方向，而陷入唯心主义的泥沼。任何时代，即使在共产主义社会的时代，每一个人的认识都不能不受到历史条件的限制。马克思主义者可以完全摆脱阶级偏见的限制，但也还不能完全摆脱其他条件的限制。事情决不像某些人想像的那样简单，以为一旦学习了物质第一性意识第二性的原理，就不会再犯唯心论的错误，或者只要进入了共产主义社会，就可以消灭唯心论。
    “百家争鸣”这一个方针，并不是突如其来的。我们的宪法规定了言论出版和科学研究的自由。“百家争鸣”不过是这种规定的进一步发展和具体化而已。
    历史上我们曾经有过学术昌盛，百家争鸣的春秋战国时代，也有过思想解放、理性觉醒的五四时期。今天我们正处在一个空前伟大的时代，我们应该有雄心来创造一个空前繁荣的文化。我们目前的学术基础是很薄弱的，但是我们的社会制度给予了科学研究的物质条件和自由——为人民、为真理的真正自由。这就是发展学术的最有力的保证。这种自由，是资本主义国家的科学家享受不到的。真理和工人阶级的利益是完全一致的。恩格斯说过，“科学愈加勇敢、愈加坚决地前进，那它就愈加符合于工人的利益和热望。”这就是在社会主义制度下科学能够发展的客观根据。
    在为社会主义奋斗的大目标下，文化科学界的人士团结起来，贡献出自己的才能和智慧，而广大群众也都涌入向文化科学进军的行列，构成一幅光辉灿烂的画图。“以一个具有高度文化的民族出现于世界”（毛泽东）。——这就是我们心目中的社会主义文化高潮。
