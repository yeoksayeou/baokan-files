    Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, July 1st: The industrial city of Chongjin in North Korea now has fifteen state-owned factories that have resumed production.
    During the war, 90% of the city's buildings and production equipment were destroyed. Thanks to the hard work of the Korean people and the generous assistance of the Polish people, the destroyed factories have now been rebuilt. The No. 1 blast furnace of the Kim Chaek Iron and Steel Works stands tall above the city, belching black smoke day and night. Since resuming production last year, the output of this blast furnace has now increased to twice that of the pre-liberation period. The four 60-meter-long converters of the Chongjin Steel Plant, which have resumed production, are constantly rotating. The output of granular iron produced by them for electric furnace steelmaking reached the pre-war level last year, and will exceed last year's output by more than 60% this year.
    Chongjin City now has a population of 120,000. According to the new construction plan, the city will be built into an industrial city with a north-south length of more than ten kilometers and a population of 350,000.

    朝鲜清津市重建工作进展迅速
    据新华社平壤1日电　朝鲜的工业城市清津现在已经有十五个国营工厂恢复生产。
    在战争期间，这个城市的建筑物和生产设备90％都被破坏了。经过朝鲜人民的辛勤劳动和波兰人民慷慨的援助，现在，被破坏了的工厂已经重新建立起来。金策制铁所第一号高炉耸立在城市上空，日夜喷着黑烟。这座高炉自从去年恢复生产以来，现在的产量已经提高到解放前的两倍。清津炼钢厂恢复生产的四座六十公尺长的大转炉不停地旋转着，它们生产的供电气炉炼钢用的粒铁的产量，去年就达到了战前的水平，今年将要超过去年60％以上。
    清津市现在已经有十二万人口。根据新的建设计划，这个城市将要建成一个南北长十多公里、有三十五万人口的工业城市。
