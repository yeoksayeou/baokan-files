    The Lives of Six Young Men

    Off the coast of South Carolina in the United States, there is a small island called Parris Island. This is a desolate island with many swamps, but the U.S. Marine Corps chose it as the main training base for recruits. One dark, starless night in early April, a sergeant instructor led seventy-odd recruits, only seventeen or eighteen years old, into the swampy area, ordering them to cross a swamp that was known to be deadly. It is said that this was a disciplinary education with a punitive nature, often held at night, because he found that some of the recruits in this platoon were undisciplined during daytime drills. The recruits carried out the instructor's orders, and although the exercise lasted only ten minutes, in a burst of chaos and cries for help, six young men drowned in the swamp.
    This is the simple account of the "death march" tragedy that recently shocked the United States and was reported in American newspapers. Of course, this is far from the whole picture of training camp life.
    American newspapers published a letter written by Thomas, one of the drowned recruits, to his family before the exercise, which read: "It's like living in hell here… Many things… I'll tell you when I get home…" But he will never be able to do so.
    A Mr. Mini complained to reporters that his eighteen-year-old son, Bobby, committed suicide last year while on leave because he could not bear the abuse of the Marine Corps. He also said that Bobby's abuse had been testified to by his twelve colleagues...
    From a report in the American "Newsweek," one can get a glimpse of some of the barbaric conditions on this island. According to the magazine, Marine recruits on Parris Island are called "waste" or "idiots" by instructors. They are often beaten and verbally abused, and are subjected to various "painful actions." "Collective punishment" is very common.
    The magazine also revealed that not only in the Marine Corps, but also throughout the U.S. military, "strictness" towards soldiers is generally advocated. Some bourgeois newspapers even called the Marine Corps instructors "professional beasts." Members of Congress have questioned the Pentagon about military training issues, and finally, even President Eisenhower ordered a special investigation into the Parris Island incident.
    In an official investigation report, Marine Corps Commandant General Pate admitted that after the war, the Marine Corps had a tendency to "torture" and "insult" soldiers during training. He stated that he would prohibit the use of "torture," "punishment," and any methods that contradict American standards of human dignity in the Marine Corps, but that the methods that had "successfully" trained the Marine Corps would not be changed. He blamed the tragedy on Parris Island on Sergeant McKeon being "drunk" and said that he would therefore be tried by court-martial on four counts: "manslaughter," "abuse of recruits," "violation of orders," and "damaging the reputation of the military."
    Obviously, this unlucky sergeant is just a scapegoat. Even Republican Congressman Cunningham spoke out in defense of McKeon, saying that if Sergeant McKeon committed "manslaughter," then the officers, at least the superior who led him, should also be "punished." Cunningham can be considered to have expressed the most basic fair view. The Chicago "People's World" pointed out the real culprit behind this tragedy to the American people in an editorial. The newspaper wrote that people can recall what General Hershey, director of the U.S. Selective Service System, said in July 1950, when he said that we need a younger generation of "killers"; in July of the same year, General Clark also said that troops must be trained to wage "war in the most barbaric way." The newspaper pointed out that Sergeant McKeon is precisely the successful product of these American military leaders who demanded the training of "a younger generation of killers to wage war in the most barbaric way."

    General: "How is the training going?"
    Sergeant: "Report! They are in normal condition."

    六个青年的生命
    在美国南卡罗来纳州南面的海上，有一个叫巴利斯的小岛。这是一个有很多沼泽的荒岛，美国海军陆战队却选择它来作为新兵的主要训练基地。四月初的一个漆黑无星的晚上，一个上士教官把七十几个年纪只有十七、八岁的新兵带到沼泽地带，命令他们通过明知可以令人丧命的沼泽。据说，这是常在晚间举行的一种带有惩戒性质的纪律教育，因为白天操练时，他发现这一排新兵有一部分人不守纪律。新兵们执行了教官的命令，虽然演习时间仅有十几分钟，但是就在一阵混乱和一片呼救声中，结果有六个年青小伙子淹死在沼泽里。
    这就是最近轰动美国并且被美国报刊称为“死亡行军”惨剧的简单经过。这当然远不是训练营生活的全貌。
    美国报刊发表了淹死的新兵之一托马斯在演习前给家里写的一封信，信上写道：“在这里就像生活在地狱里一般……许多事……等我回家时再告诉你们……”。可是他永远不可能做到了。
    有一位米尼先生向新闻记者控诉说，他的十八岁儿子保比，由于忍受不了陆战队的虐待，在去年回家休假时自杀了。他还说，保比所受的种种虐待，有他的十二个同事签名证明……
    从美国“新闻周刊”的一篇报道中，人们可以捉摸到这个岛上的一些野蛮情况。据这家杂志的报道，陆战队新兵在巴利斯岛上被教官叫作“废物”或“笨蛋”。他们常被殴打和辱骂，并且被罚做各种“痛苦的动作”。“集体惩罚”很盛行。
    这家杂志还透露，目前不仅在海军陆战队，并且在整个美国军队中，都普遍提倡对士兵“严厉”。一些资产阶级报纸甚至于把海军陆战队的教官称为“职业畜生”。国会议员纷纷就军队训练问题向五角大楼提出质问，最后，连艾森豪威尔总统也命令必须对巴利斯岛事件进行专门调查。
    在一份官方调查报告中，海军陆战队司令潘特将军承认说，战后海军陆战队在士兵训练时期产生了对士兵采取“折磨”和“侮辱”的趋向。他表示要禁止在陆战队采用“折磨”、“惩罚”以及任何与美国标准的人类尊严相抵触的方法对待士兵，但是，曾经“成功地”训练陆战队的一套方法将不予改变。他把巴利斯岛上发生的惨剧归咎于麦克翁上士“喝醉了酒”，并且说因此将对他进行军事法庭的审判，加以“杀人”、“虐待新兵”、“违犯命令”和“损害军队威信”四项罪名。
    显然，这位倒霉的上士不过是一只替罪羊。连共和党众议员坎宁汉也替麦克翁鸣了不平，他说，如果麦克翁上士犯了“杀人罪”，那么军官们，至少领导他的那一位上级，也应该“惩罚”。坎宁汉算是发表了最起码的公平观点。芝加哥“人民世界报”在一篇社论中，却向美国人民指出了这场悲剧幕后的真正凶手。这家报纸写道，人们可以回忆1950年7月美国征兵局长赫尔赛将军说的话，当时他说，我们需要年青一代的“杀人者”；同年七月，克拉克将军也说，必须训练部队进行“最野蛮方式的战争”。这家报纸指出，麦克翁上士，正是这批要求训练“年青一代的杀人者进行最野蛮方式的战争”的美国军事领袖们成功的产品。（林龙铁）（附图片）
    将军：“训练进行得怎么样了？”
    上士：“报告！他们处在正常的状态。”
