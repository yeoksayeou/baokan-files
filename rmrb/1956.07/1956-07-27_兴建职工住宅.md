    兴建职工住宅
    据新华社讯　兰州市各厂矿、建筑企业，今年将兴建七十多万平方公尺的职工住宅。这个数字等于兰州市1950年到1955年新建职工住宅总面积的两倍。现在，这批新建住宅工程已经有二十多万平方公尺开工。
    江西省今年计划为厂矿企业职工兴建十四万平方公尺的新住宅。其中有四万三千多平方公尺，在今年上半年已经建成。现在，江西化工厂、江西电机厂和江西机械厂等工厂的大约二千六百多户职工家属，已经先后迁入新房。今年江西省投资新建的职工住宅加上第一个五年计划前三年建筑的住宅，超过第一个五年计划规定职工住宅建筑总面积的26.1％。
    沈阳铁路管理局正在为两千多户铁路职工兴建新住宅。由国家投资兴建的首批三百户职工的新住宅，已经在七月十日开工，预计工人在十月间就能迁入新居。采取自建公助的办法，贷款给一千三百多户职工自己兴建的新住宅，预计将在八月末全部建成。最近，他们又拨出一批企业奖励基金，决定再新建两万多平方公尺的新住宅。此外，他们还利用旧仓库和旧办公室等，改建成几百户职工住宅，并且在住宅区整修和新建了一批俱乐部、食堂、澡塘、托儿所和公共厕所。
