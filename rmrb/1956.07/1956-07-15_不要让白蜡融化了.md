Don't Let the Paraffin Wax Melt

The Hangzhou Chemical Raw Materials Company has a backlog of imported paraffin wax. Because this paraffin wax has been stored for too long, coupled with the current hot weather, some of it has already melted.

The reason for the backlog of paraffin wax is that the sales plan of the Hangzhou Chemical Raw Materials Company was too large; at the same time, the Zhejiang Provincial Chemical Raw Materials Company blindly transferred 120 tons of paraffin wax to them, which made the backlog of paraffin wax even more serious.

    不要让白蜡融化了
    杭州市化工原料公司积压了许多进口白蜡。这些白蜡因为搁得太久，加上目前天气炎热，有的已经融化了。
    积压白蜡的原因，是杭州市化工原料公司的销售计划偏大；同时浙江省化工原料公司又盲目调给他们一百二十吨白蜡，这就使白蜡的积压更严重了。　（俞宏业）
