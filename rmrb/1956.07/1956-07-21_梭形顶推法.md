    Shuttle-Shaped Pushing Method

    (By our correspondent) On the winding waterways with turbulent currents of the Sichuan River, an advanced method of ship transportation - the "Shuttle-Shaped Pushing Method" - is being widely promoted among the tow-barge fleets on the Yichang-Chongqing section of the Sichuan River. On this route, 61% of the ships that can tow double barges are now using this method.

      The "Shuttle-Shaped Pushing Method" has greater advantages than the "Semi-Pushing Method" which was commonly used by tow-barge fleets on the Sichuan River in the past. It can reduce the resistance of the fleet during navigation and greatly improve transportation efficiency. A tugboat with 2,000 horsepower using the "Shuttle-Shaped Pushing Method" can travel from Yichang to Chongqing six hours and eighteen minutes faster and save 0.8% of coal compared to the "Semi-Pushing Method."

    梭形顶推法
    本报讯　航道弯曲、水流湍急的川江上，一种先进的船舶运输方法——“梭形顶推法”，正在川江宜（昌）渝（重庆）线上的拖驳船队中广泛推行。在这条航线上，现在有61％可以拖双驳的船舶推行了这个方法。
      “梭形顶推法”，比过去川江上拖驳船队普遍采用的“半顶推法”具有更大的优越性。它可减少船队航行中的阻力，大大提高运输效率。一艘二千匹马力的拖轮采用“梭形顶推法”，从宜昌到重庆可比“半顶推法”快六点十八分，节省燃煤0.8％。
