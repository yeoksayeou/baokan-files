Xinhua News Agency, Hami, 29th. Construction preparation work is being stepped up for the section east of Hami on the Lanxin Railway where track has not yet been laid. In the Gobi Desert on both sides of the line, from Hongliu River at the Gansu-Xinjiang border south of Xingxing Gorge to Kushui, green tents have recently appeared. The first group of Uyghur, Han, and Hui workers have entered the construction site; some road construction workers and rock blasting workers have also arrived at the construction site one after another.

The construction of four simple highways, totaling 300 kilometers in length, leading to the construction site from Xingxing Gorge, Luotuoquan and other places, has been more than one-third completed. On the newly built highways, trucks transporting road-building materials, grains, and vegetables are shuttling back and forth every day.

Workers' sheds for road construction workers are also being built along the Gobi Desert. These sheds will be built strong and tight in accordance with the winter living needs, and can withstand the strong winds and severe cold in the Gobi Desert. At Xingxing Gorge and Luotuoquan, three newly built water supply bases have begun to supply fresh water to the construction site.

    兰新铁路哈密以东的线路
    加紧进行施工准备工作
    新华社哈密29日电　兰新铁路哈密以东没有铺轨的线路修筑工程，正在加紧进行施工准备工作。从猩猩峡以南的甘（肃）新（疆）交界处的红柳河起，西到苦水之间线路两侧的戈壁滩上，新近已经出现了一座座草绿色的帐篷。第一批维吾尔、汉、回等族民工，已经进入了工地；一部分筑路职工和石方爆破工人，也陆续到达了工地。
    从猩猩峡、骆驼圈等地通向工地的四条总长达三百公里的简易公路的修建工程，已经完成了三分之一以上。新修成的公路上，每天都穿梭般地奔驰着运输筑路器材和粮食、蔬菜等的卡车。
    筑路职工住的工棚，也正在沿线戈壁滩上修盖。这些工棚都将按照冬季居住的需要，修得坚固、严密，能够抵御戈壁滩上的大风和严寒。在猩猩峡和骆驼圈，新近修好的三处供水基地，已经开始向工地供应淡水。
