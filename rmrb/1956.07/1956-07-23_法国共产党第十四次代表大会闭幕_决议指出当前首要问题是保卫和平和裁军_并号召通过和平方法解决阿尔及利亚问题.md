Xinhua News Agency, Hafoer, July 22nd (TASS): The 14th Congress of the French Communist Party closed on July 22nd.

    The congress passed a resolution on political issues. When discussing the French economic situation, the resolution stated that the unbalanced economic development of capitalist countries is causing losses to France and the French economy. France is suffering from the bad consequences of the traditional policies of financial oligarchs, who prefer to export capital rather than invest it in the domestic economy, thus hindering the development of French productive forces. The resolution said that in France, latent crisis phenomena can already be seen.

    The resolution then analyzed the impoverished state of the French working people. It pointed out that economic stagnation and the poverty of the working people are largely due to the direction of French foreign policy.

    The resolution also pointed out new factors in the international situation, considering that the most important factor is that socialism has become a world system. The resolution also talked about the current easing of international tensions.

    The resolution continued, "The collapse of the imperialist colonial system requires the French people to make fundamental political decisions. The ruling class is not capable of guaranteeing a solution, in a democratic and national spirit, to the problems arising from the loss of historical colonial positions."

    The resolution condemned the Algerian war and called for a peaceful resolution to the Algerian issue, taking into account the national aspirations of the Algerian people. The congress believes that it is possible to establish a true French Federation based on the free union of all nations.

    The resolution also analyzed the methods and forces capable of preventing war under modern conditions. The resolution said: "The goal of the French Communist Party is to make our government act with the purposes of peaceful coexistence, disarmament and collective security, and of turning the easing of the international situation into lasting peace. In order to implement this national policy, the Communists strive to unite all patriots and strive to continuously develop a powerful movement to defend peace in which millions of French people participate." The congress believes that one of the most important issues at present is defending peace and resolving the issue of disarmament.

    The congress pointed out the great international significance of the resolutions of the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union regarding the paths of different countries transitioning to socialism. The congress pointed out that this resolution helps Communists around the world draw profound lessons from the changes that have occurred in the current situation. It is possible to unite the majority of the working people of France around the working class, and in this way strive to win a majority in parliament and transform parliament from a tool of the bourgeoisie into a truly popular organ that relies on the mass revolutionary movement.

    The resolution formulated the current tasks of the French Communist Party in defending the interests of workers and working peasants, and also mentioned ways to establish the unity of the working class.

    The final part of the resolution discussed the issues of the party and the work of the party.

    法国共产党第十四次代表大会闭幕
    决议指出当前首要问题是保卫和平和裁军
    并号召通过和平方法解决阿尔及利亚问题
    新华社22日讯　据塔斯社哈佛尔讯：法国共产党第十四次代表大会在七月二十二日闭幕。
    大会通过了关于政治问题的决议，决议在谈到法国经济情况的时候说，资本主义国家不平衡的经济发展给法国和法国的经济带来损失。法国遭受到财政寡头传统政策造成的恶果，财政寡头宁愿输出资本，而不愿把资本投在本国经济中，这样就使法国生产力的发展受到阻碍。决议说，在法国，实际上已经可以看出隐伏的危机现象。
    决议接着分析法国劳动人民的贫困状况。它指出，经济的停滞和劳动人民的贫困在很大程度上是由于法国外交政策的方针而产生的。
    决议也指出国际情势中出现的新因素，认为其中最重要的因素是社会主义已经变成了世界的体系。决议也谈到了目前国际紧张局势的缓和。
    决议接着说，“帝国主义殖民体系的崩溃使法国人民必须作出根本的政治决定。统治阶级没有能力保证本着民主精神和民族精神来解决由于丧失历来的殖民阵地而产生的问题。”
    决议谴责阿尔及利亚战争，号召考虑阿尔及利亚人民的民族愿望来和平解决阿尔及利亚问题。代表大会认为，建立以各民族自由联合为基础的、真正的法兰西联邦是可能的。
    决议还对在现代条件下能够防止战争的办法和力量作了分析。决议说：“法国共产党奋斗的目标就是：使我国政府本着和平共处、裁军和集体安全、本着变国际局势的缓和为持久和平这样一些目的行事。为了执行这种国策，共产党人争取团结一切爱国人士，争取不断发展有千百万法国人参加的强大的保卫和平运动。”代表大会认为目前最重要的问题之一是保卫和平和解决裁军问题。
    代表大会指出了苏联共产党第二十次代表大会决议中关于不同国家向社会主义过渡的道路这一部分的重大国际意义。代表大会指出，这一决议帮助全世界的共产党人从目前局势发生的变化中吸取深刻的教训。把法国大多数劳动人民团结在工人阶级的周围，用这种办法争取在议会中占多数，把议会由资产阶级的工具变成为依靠群众革命运动的、真正表达人民意志的机关，是可能的。
    决议中拟定出法国共产党在保卫工人和劳动农民利益方面的当前任务，还提到建立工人阶级团结的办法。
    决议最后一部分谈到党的问题和党的工作的问题。
