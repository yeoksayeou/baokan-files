    Difficulty Reading Newspapers While Working Away From Home
    From July 1st to the 11th, I worked in Pingyuan County, Shandong Province, for eleven days.
    After settling in with the arranged accommodation, I went to find a place to satisfy my spiritual nourishment. I went to the post office, but they didn't have retail sales and didn't sell the "People's Daily"; then I found the cultural center, only to find that it was under repair and closed for reading.
    Isn't it possible to consider expanding newspaper retail sales? And as for a county's cultural center, during such a long repair period, can't they find a room to display newspapers and magazines for readers to read? (Yi Zhen)

    在外工作看报难
    从七月一日到十一日，我到山东省的平原县城工作了十一天。
    在安排下食宿之后，我就去寻找解决精神食粮的场所。我跑到邮局，他们没有零售业务，不零售
  “人民日报”；又找到文化馆，谁知文化馆在修理房屋，停止阅览。
    是不是可以考虑扩大报纸的零售业务呢？而作为一个县的文化馆，在这样长的修理期间，难道不能找一点房子把报纸、杂志陈列出来，让读者阅读吗？　（易珍）
