Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, July 17th: The public representatives and private personnel of the Shanghai Public-Private Partnership Yong'an Company sat together cordially yesterday to hold a symposium, exchanging opinions on various aspects of work after the public-private partnership of the enterprise.

In the speeches of the private personnel, they all believed that the cooperation between the public and private parties has been good in the six months since Yong'an Company's public-private partnership. Guo Linshuang, Chairman and Manager, said: In terms of leadership, one manager and three deputy managers are assigned to be responsible for different tasks, and collective leadership is implemented. Every week, three mornings are dedicated to managers' meetings for brainstorming. Many things are decided after joint discussion at the meetings. Private personnel arranged to be department heads not only have the same duties and powers, but are also extremely busy. Thanks to the leadership of the public representatives and the support of the employees, Yong'an Company turned from years of losses to a surplus in less than three months after the public-private partnership. He said that the relationship between private personnel and employees is also normal. Nine private department heads participate in socialist competitions with the employees, and six of them received awards in the first quarter. The trade union also invites private personnel to participate in learning and recreational activities.

Private personnel also raised some criticisms and requests regarding personnel arrangements, supply of goods, political study, and welfare, among other issues. For example, although all eighteen former equity-holding staff members of the original Yong'an Co., Ltd. were arranged for positions at the time of the partnership, some were not appropriate, and they still have no specific work to this day. They criticized the relevant commercial departments for emphasizing that they cannot operate across industries and for not allocating high-end hams and fruits, making it difficult for Yong'an Company to develop the operational characteristics of a comprehensive store. Some private personnel requested opportunities to study policies and theories, while others requested to receive living subsidies.

In their speeches, private personnel also examined their own shortcomings, such as favoring the operation of brand-name goods and formulating conservative plans.

Chen Xunguan, the first deputy manager and public representative, said that since the public-private partnership of the enterprise, the relationship between the public and private parties has been normal, and the private personnel have also played a positive role. However, there is more contact in work and less communication on personal matters. He expressed acceptance of the opinions of the private personnel and responded to some specific issues. He also put forward suggestions on further improving the cooperative relationship between the two parties in the future.

Both the public and private parties believe that such meetings are very good and should be held regularly in the future.

    上海市永安公司公私双方举行座谈会
    进一步改善公私共事关系
    新华社上海17日电　上海市公私合营永安公司的公方代表和私方人员，昨天亲切地坐在一起开座谈会，交换企业公私合营后各方面工作的意见。
    私方人员的发言中，都认为永安公司自从公私合营以后的半年中，公私双方合作共事关系是好的。董事长兼经理郭琳爽说：在领导工作上，一个经理和三个副经理分工负责，实行集体领导，每星期有三个上午是经理开会碰头的时间，许多事情都是在会上共同商量以后决定的。在每星期一次的科长会议上，公方代表和我一起听取汇报，讨论和检查计划执行情况等。被安排担任科长的私方人员不但同样有职有权，而且是忙不过来。由于公方代表领导和职工支持，永安公司公私合营不到三个月，就由历年亏损转为盈余。他说，私方人员和职工的关系也是正常的，九个私方科长和职工一起参加社会主义竞赛，并且有六人在第一季度评奖中获得了奖励。工会也邀请私方人员参加学习和文娱活动。
    私方人员对人事安排、货源组织、政治学习和生活福利等问题，也提出了一些批评和要求。例如原永安股份有限公司的十八名资方实职人员，合营的时候虽然都得到安排，但是个别由于不够恰当，至今没有具体工作。他们批评有关商业部门强调不能跨业经营，不分配高档的火腿和水果，使永安公司发扬综合性商店的经营特点有困难。有的私方人员提出要求，希望能有学习政策理论的机会；有的要求能得到生活补助金。
    私方人员的发言中，也检查了自己爱经营名牌货、制定计划保守等缺点。
    公方代表、第一副经理陈恂贯说，企业公私合营以来，公、私双方的关系是正常的，私方人员也发挥了积极作用；但是，彼此在工作上接触得多，谈心、谈家常就比较少。他表示接受私方人员的意见，对一些具体问题也作了答复。他并且对今后进一步改善双方合作共事关系，提出了意见。
    公私双方都认为这样的会议很好，以后要经常开。
