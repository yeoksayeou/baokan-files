    Fresh Apples from Liaoning Shipped to the Mongolian People's Republic

    (Our dispatch) The "Fu Apples" (Huang Kui variety) produced this year in Gaiping and Fuxian counties, Liaoning Province, began exporting for the first time on July 3rd from Xiongyuecheng in the fruit-producing area. This batch of apples was shipped to celebrate the National Day of the Mongolian People's Republic. In order to transport fresh apples to the Mongolian People's Republic, the fruit tree production cooperatives in Fuxian and Gaiping counties picked the best fresh apples from the trees in advance, and after being packaged by the purchasing departments, they were transported in refrigerated cars with ice.

    Currently, the Gaiping and Fuxian purchasing stations of the Liaoning Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative have begun purchasing Fu Apples, which will be shipped in large quantities to the Soviet Union and other fraternal countries, as well as to various cities in China, in July and August.

    辽宁的鲜苹果运往蒙古人民共和国
    本报讯　辽宁省盖平、复县两地今年生产的伏苹果（黄奎），在七月三日由产果区熊岳城第一次开始出口。这批苹果是为了祝贺蒙古人民共和国国庆节而运去的。为了把新鲜的苹果运往蒙古人民共和国，复县、盖平两县的各果树生产合作社，提前从果树上摘下了最好的鲜苹果，经过采购部门包装好后，用冷藏车加冰运出。
    现在、辽宁省供销合作社盖平、复县采购站已开始收购伏苹果，将在七、八月份大量运往苏联等兄弟国家和国内各城市。　（景玉德）
