    Shanghai's Industry Can Play a Greater Role
    By Staff Reporter Ji Yin
    The question of fully utilizing the potential of coastal industries has been placed on the important work agenda of our country. People are now asking: What about Shanghai, the most concentrated coastal city of modern industry in our country? What has Shanghai's industry already done in the past few years? What new contributions can it make to the country in the future? …
    This article intends to briefly answer these questions that readers are concerned about.

    Light Industry Faces an Increasingly
    Expanding Domestic and International Market
    As everyone knows, Shanghai is the city with the highest concentration of textile and light industries in our country. Before liberation, 70% of the cotton for Shanghai's textile industry had to be imported from the United States, and 50% of the wheat and 60% of the tobacco for light industry were also imported from abroad. Now, the vast rural areas of the country have become its raw material supply base and sales market. Shanghai's light and textile industries, which are now independent and self-reliant, have experienced rapid growth in production in recent years. Compared with 1949, the output value of Shanghai's light industry has increased by 2.1 times, and the output value of the textile industry has increased by 1.3 times this year. These achievements have been mainly obtained by using existing equipment.
    Now, Shanghai is the largest supply base of daily-use industrial products in the country. The cotton cloth, cotton yarn, and cigarettes produced here account for about one-third of the country's total output. 70% of the toothpaste used by consumers nationwide is produced in Shanghai. 60% of the thermos bottles in the country also come from Shanghai. The proportion of Western medicine produced in Shanghai is even greater...
    Shanghai's light industrial products are not only large in quantity, but also come in a wide variety, novel styles, and good quality. Shanghai's textile industry produces thousands of varieties of patterned fabrics and dozens of high-grade textiles every year, such as 100-count combed cotton yarn, cashmere, velvet, and high-grade wool fabrics. Shanghai also produces dozens of special high-grade textiles, such as tire cord fabric, insulating silk, parachute silk, and yellow wax cloth, to supply the whole country. Shanghai's light industrial products are even more all-encompassing. It has 122 industries, and it is difficult to make an accurate statistics of product types. In the Shanghai Daily-Use Merchandise Product Exhibition Hall, there are thousands of samples on display, and this is still very incomplete, because Shanghai's light industrial factories are almost constantly manufacturing new specifications of products, and the product display department often lags behind actual life.
    Today, Shanghai's light industry not only supplies the increasingly expanding domestic market, but also enjoys an increasingly high reputation in the international market. Shanghai now exports more than 3,000 kinds of industrial products, mainly light industrial products. Many products have a large proportion of exports, such as silk and worsted wool fabrics, which account for 80% of Shanghai's total output, towel quilts account for 81%, and nearly 10 million bolts of cloth are exported every year.

    Heavy Industry Forms an Independent
    Manufacturing System
    Shanghai's heavy industry has developed considerably in recent years. Compared with 1949, Shanghai's light industry output value will increase by 2.1 times in 1956, and heavy industry will increase by 10.2 times. The proportion of Shanghai's heavy industry in the city's total output value has also increased rapidly. In 1949, Shanghai's heavy industry accounted for 7.92% of the city's total output value, and it will increase to 27% in 1956.
    In the past, Shanghai's heavy industry was only an assembly and repair industry serving ships and light and textile industries, lacking independent manufacturing capabilities, and raw materials also depended on foreign countries. This situation has now been fundamentally changed. Shanghai's heavy industry is now manufacturing complete sets of machinery and equipment for the country. The proportion of complete sets of equipment manufactured and the collaborative manufacturing of important parts by the mechanical and electrical manufacturing industry of Shanghai's local industry has now increased to 97.1%, and the task of repair and odd jobs has dropped to 2.9%. In the past two years, many heavy industrial factories have further shifted from manufacturing old-specifications of machines and equipment to manufacturing new-type of machines and equipment. For example, after the successful manufacture of 6,000-kilowatt power generation equipment, it has now begun to collaborate in the manufacture of 12,000-kilowatt power generation equipment.
    Shanghai's heavy industry includes the mechanical and electrical industry, shipbuilding industry, metal smelting industry, chemical industry, and building materials industry. Among them, the fastest growing are the mechanical and electrical and shipbuilding industries. In 1955, the total output value of Shanghai's mechanical and electrical industry accounted for one-fifth of the total output value of the country's mechanical and electrical industry. The growth rate of production in many factories is astonishing. For example, the output of the Shanghai Wire Factory in 1955 was 474 times that of 1950, and the output of the Shanghai Bicycle Factory in 1955 was 26 times that of 1950.
    Shanghai's metal smelting industry is also developing rapidly. From the early days of liberation to 1956, the annual steel production of the steel industry has increased by nearly 79 times. Shanghai's steel has many varieties and specifications, and hundreds of specifications of small and medium-sized steel are supplied to all parts of the country, accounting for 70% of the country's supply. The technical level of steelmaking and steel rolling has also improved quite rapidly.

    Superior Technical Conditions
    The rapid development of Shanghai's industry is inseparable from its superior technical conditions.
    A factory in Shanghai recently successfully trial-produced a precision instrument: a box-type sensitive galvanometer. It can directly measure a current of one hundred millionth of an ampere. It is nearly ten times more sensitive than the galvanometer currently used by this factory. Since 1952, this factory has successfully trial-produced nearly 30 kinds of new precision products, three of which have been exhibited abroad and are about to be test-marketed abroad. However, the entire factory building of this factory is just an ordinary two-story building, and most of the machinery and equipment are modified old machine tools. The entire factory has only fourteen workers, and many workers also do several jobs concurrently. This factory is called Lianyan Electrical Instrument Factory.
    There are many "alley factories" like this in Shanghai that have a relatively high technical level but are small in scale. In the past few years, quite complex instruments and high-quality boilers have been manufactured in many factories with simple equipment, and some products have reached international standards. Some precision instruments can also be copied by these factories without drawings.
    The result of more than 100 years of industrial development has cultivated a valuable technical force in Shanghai. According to incomplete statistics, Shanghai currently has more than 30,000 engineering and technical personnel equivalent to technicians or above (excluding the original private industrial enterprises) and more than 320,000 skilled technical workers. Among them, some are technical personnel with scientific theoretical knowledge, and some are experts who lack theoretical knowledge or are even illiterate, but are extremely rich in practical experience. Among the capitalists in Shanghai, it is estimated that there are also seven or eight thousand talented people with production technology capabilities, many of whom have special technologies. After the implementation of joint state-private ownership in enterprises, their enthusiasm for studying technology is very high. In addition, Shanghai also has many experts and researchers distributed in colleges and universities and scientific and technological research institutions, and they also have contacts with production units.
    Another important feature of Shanghai in terms of technology is that the city has 194 industries, the types of work are quite complete, and production collaboration is very extensive. Many factories have traditional cooperative relationships. Often a very small factory can rely on collaboration to continuously assemble a large number of lathes. The production of a new product can be quickly completed due to the collaboration of many factories. This cooperative relationship is also reflected in the rational use of raw materials. The waste and by-products produced by many large factories are utilized layer by layer by some small and medium-sized factories, which greatly reduces the cost of industrial products.
    Shanghai also has a fairly developed transportation network. Railways, highways, sea transportation, the Yangtze River and inland river shipping, air transportation and other dozens of transportation lines closely connect Shanghai with all parts of the country and overseas markets.
    These favorable conditions of Shanghai's industry cannot be compared with other parts of the country.

    Shanghai's Industry
    Contains Huge Potential
    Shanghai has been playing the role of an industrial base for several years. It has sent tens of thousands of various machine tools and a large number of other heavy industrial products to the whole country. Dozens of its factories directly support projects such as Anshan Iron and Steel and Changchun Automobile Factory, producing dozens of main products. It produces more than 400 kinds of mechanical parts for the Northwest Petroleum Industry. It has sent nearly 210,000 people to various provinces and cities across the country. It supplies about 60% of the country's total supply of daily-use merchandise. It has accumulated a large amount of construction funds for the country. According to statistics, the profit income and state tax revenue of Shanghai's various departments and enterprises since liberation account for about 20.9% of the basic construction investment amount of my country's first five-year plan. ... These figures are enough to prove how important it is to utilize coastal industries.
    Although Shanghai has made many contributions to the country, the industrial enterprises in Shanghai still have huge potential that has not been utilized. The relevant departments in Shanghai have conducted some preliminary investigations. For example, the utilization rate of existing equipment in factories throughout Shanghai is generally below 70%, except for heavy industry which is higher, such as cotton yarn at 54%, cotton cloth at 61%, paper at 67%, cigarettes at 38%, automobile tires at 43%, and so on. Some factories can increase production as long as they adjust the surplus factory buildings. For example, utilizing the vacant factory buildings of textile factories throughout the city can add more than 100,000 spindles and 600 looms. Some factories have unbalanced machinery and equipment, and production capacity can be greatly increased if they are properly allocated and added. Some factories can increase the number of shifts if they reasonably adjust the workers' living and transportation conditions.
    Shanghai has a better industrial foundation. Many factories can quickly benefit from expansion with a little investment, which is much faster and cheaper than building new factories. If a meter factory in Shanghai is expanded, it can produce a large amount of products within a year, while building a new meter factory in the inland that is twice as large as it requires four times more investment and takes at least three years to put into production. A steel factory in Shanghai, after expansion, can increase the production of paper-making machines, saving 16 million yuan per year, and all the investment can be recovered in just a few months. However, another feature of many factories in Shanghai is that the equipment is old and unbalanced, some still retain backward manual operations, and the factories are too dispersed. These factories need to be technically transformed and economically reorganized in a planned way to better unleash their potential. In the past, due to insufficient understanding of the significance of utilizing coastal industries, the transformation of Shanghai's industry was not active enough, so that these many potential forces have not been fully mobilized.
    The explicit proposal of the issue of fully utilizing coastal industries has given great encouragement to the vast number of cadres and workers in Shanghai's factories and enterprises. Recently, Shanghai's leading organs are re-discussing the development plan of Shanghai's industry in the next few years, and a more beautiful long-term vision is being designed.

    上海的工业可以发挥更大的作用
    本报记者　季音
    充分发挥沿海工业的潜力问题，被提到我们国家重要的工作日程上来了。现在人们在问：我国近代工业最集中的沿海城市上海，今天不知道怎样了？上海的工业在过去几年中已经作了些什么？今后还能为国家作出些什么新的贡献？……
    这篇文章里准备简略地答复读者们所关心的这些问题。
    轻工业面向着日益
    扩大的国内外市场
    大家都知道，上海是我国纺织、轻工业最集中的城市。解放前，上海纺织工业有70％的棉花要从美国进口，轻工业中也有50％的小麦、60％的烟叶从国外输入。现在，国内广大农村成了它的原料供应基地和销售市场。已经独立自主的上海轻、纺工业几年来生产迅速增长，以今年同1949年比较，上海轻工业的产值增长了二点一倍，纺织工业的产值增长了一点三倍。这些成绩主要是利用旧有设备得到的。
    现在上海是全国最大的日用工业品的供应基地。这里生产的棉布棉纱和卷烟约占全国总产量的三分之一。全国消费者所用的牙膏有70％是上海生产的。全国的热水瓶也有60％来自上海。上海生产的西药比重甚至还要大……。
    上海生产的轻工业品不仅数量庞大，而且品种极多，式样新颖，质量较好。上海纺织工业每年生产上千种的各式花布，几十种高级纺织品，如一百支精梳棉纱、开司米、丝绒、高级毛织品等。上海还生产数十种特种高级纺织品，如轮胎帘布、绝缘绸、降落伞绸、黄蜡布等等，供应全国。上海的轻工业品更是包罗万象，它有122个行业，产品种类很难作出精确的统计。在上海市日用百货产品陈列所里，就陈列着一万几千种样品，这还是很不完全的，因为上海轻工业工厂中几乎每天不断地在制造着新规格的产品，产品陈列部门往往落在实际生活的后边。
    上海的轻工业今天不仅供应着日益扩大的国内市场，它在国际市场上也是声誉愈来愈高。上海现在出口的工业品已有三千多种，其中主要是轻工业品，不少产品出口的比重很大，如丝绸、精纺呢绒的出口量都占上海总产量的80％，毛巾被占81％，布匹的出口每年也近一千万匹。
    形成了独立制造
    体系的重工业
    上海的重工业几年来有相当大的发展，同1949年比较，1956年上海轻工业的产值将增长2.1倍，重工业将增长10.2倍。上海重工业在全市所占的比重也迅速增长了，1949年上海重工业占全市总产值7.92％，1956年将增长为27％。
    过去，上海的重工业只是为船舶和轻、纺工业服务的装配修理性质的工业，缺乏独立制造的能力，原料也依赖国外。这种状况现在已经根本改变，上海的重工业现在为国家制造着成套的机器设备。上海地方工业的机电制造业制造成套设备和协作制造重要配件的比重，现在已经增加到97.1％，修配打杂任务已下降到2.9％。这两年来，许多重工业工厂又进一步从制造旧规格的机器装备，转向制造新型的机器装备。例如，继六千瓩发电设备制造成功之后，现在已经开始协作制造一万二千瓩的发电设备。
    上海的重工业包括机电工业、造船工业、金属冶制工业、化学工业、建筑材料工业等部门，其中发展最快的是机电、造船工业。1955年上海机电工业总产值占全国机电工业总产值的五分之一。许多厂生产的增长速度是惊人的，例如上海电线厂1955年的产量为1950年的474倍，上海自行车厂1955年的产量为1950年的26倍。
    上海的金属冶制工业也在迅速发展，钢铁工业的炼钢年产量从解放初期到1956年，已增长了将近79倍。上海钢材的花色品种多，数百种规格的中小型钢材供应着全国各地，占全国供应比重的70％。炼钢、轧钢的技术水平也提高得相当快。
    优越的技术条件
    上海工业的迅速发展，同它的优越的技术条件是分不开的。
    上海有一家工厂，最近试制成功一种精密仪器：箱式灵敏检流器。它能直接测量一万万分之一安培的电流。它比这个厂现在使用的检流器灵敏度要高出近十倍。这个厂从1952年以来，已试制成功了近三十种精密的新产品，其中有三种已经出国展览，就要到国外试销。但是这个厂的全部厂房只是一幢普通的二层楼房，机器设备大多是旧机床改装的，全厂仅十四个工人，许多工人都兼做几种活。这个厂叫联研电工仪器厂。
    上海像这种有相当高的技术水平，但是规模很小的“弄堂工厂”是很多的。几年来，在许多设备简陋的工厂里，制造出了相当复杂的仪表、质量优良的锅炉，有的产品达到了国际水平。有些精密仪器在没有图样的情形下，这些工厂也可以仿制出来。
    一百多年来工业发展的结果，给上海培养出了一支可贵的技术力量。据不完全统计，上海现有相当于技术员以上的工程技术人员三万多人（不包括原私营工业企业），熟练技术工人三十二万多人。他们当中有的是有科学理论知识的技术人员，也有一部分是缺少理论知识、甚至是文盲，但都是实际经验极其丰富的专家。在上海的资本家中，据估计也有七、八千名具有生产技术能力的人才，其中还有不少是有特种技术的，他们在企业实行公私合营以后，钻研技术的积极性都很高。此外，上海还有不少分布在大专学校和科学技术研究机构中的专家和研究人员，他们跟生产单位也有联系。
    上海在技术上的另一重要特点是：全市有194个行业，工种相当齐全，生产协作非常广泛，许多工厂都有传统的协作关系。往往一个很小的工厂，依靠协作，就可以源源不绝地装配出大批的车床来。生产一种新产品，由于许多厂协作，很快就可以制成。这种协作关系还表现在合理利用原材料上，许多大工厂生产后的废料、副产品，由一些中小工厂一层层的加以利用，这样便使得工业产品的成本大大降低。
    上海还有相当发达的交通运输网。铁路、公路、海运、长江和内河航运、空运等数十条运输线，把上海和全国各地以及海外市场紧密地联系起来。
    上海工业的这些有利条件，是国内其他地方不能比拟的。
    上海的工业
    蕴藏着巨大潜力
    上海几年来一直发挥着工业基地的作用，它向全国送出了数以万计的各种机床和大批的其他重工业产品。它有几十个工厂直接支援着鞍钢、长春汽车厂等工程，生产着数十种主要产品。它为西北石油工业生产着四百多种机械配件。它向全国各省市送出了近二十一万人。它供应着约占全国总供应量60％左右的日用百货。它为国家积累了大量建设资金，据统计，解放以来上海各部门企业利润收入和国家税收，约占我国第一个五年计划基本建设投资额的20.9％。……这些数字已足以证明利用沿海工业是何等重要。
    尽管上海已经给国家作出了不少的贡献，但是上海的工业企业仍然蕴藏着巨大的潜力还没有被利用。上海有关部门曾作了些粗略调查，例如上海全市工厂现有设备利用率，除重工业较高外，一般都在70％以下，如棉纱为54％，棉布为61％，纸为67％，卷烟为38％，汽车轮胎为43％，等等。有的工厂只要调整一下多余厂房，即可增产，如利用全市纺织厂空余厂房，就可增添十万多枚纱锭和六百台布机。有的工厂机器设备不平衡，如果适当调配添置，生产能力也可以大大增加。有的工厂只要合理调整一下工人的居住、交通条件，就可以增加开工的班次。
    上海工业基础较好，不少工厂只要稍加投资进行扩建，就可以很快收效，比新建厂要快得多，省得多。上海有一个仪表厂，如果加以扩建，一年内即可大量生产，而在内地建设一个比它大一倍的新仪表厂，投资要多四倍，至少要三年才能投入生产。上海有一家铁工厂，扩建后，就可增产造纸机，每年可节约一千六百万元，只要几个月就可以把投资全部收回。但上海许多工厂的另一特点是设备陈旧，不平衡，有的还保留着落后的手工操作，工厂又过于分散，这些工厂需要有计划地进行技术改造和经济改组，才能更好地发挥潜力。过去由于对利用沿海工业的意义认识不足，上海工业的改造是不够积极的，以致这许多潜在力量还没有被充分调动起来。
    充分利用沿海工业的问题被明确地提出来以后，给了上海工厂企业的广大干部和工人以极大的鼓舞。最近，上海的领导机关正在重新讨论今后若干年内上海工业的发展规划，一幅更美丽的远景图正在设计中。
