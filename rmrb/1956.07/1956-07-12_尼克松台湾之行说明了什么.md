Nixon's Trip to Taiwan—What Does it Show?

U.S. Vice President Nixon visited Taiwan on July 7th and 8th and held talks with the Chiang Kai-shek clique. Nixon's visit once again shows that the United States intends to occupy Taiwan for a long time and obstruct the easing of tensions in the Taiwan region.

Nixon's visit to Taiwan was decided by Washington on short notice after Premier Zhou Enlai expressed at the Third Session of the First National People's Congress his willingness to consult with the Taiwan authorities on the specific steps and conditions for the peaceful liberation of Taiwan. Premier Zhou Enlai's statement on the peaceful liberation of Taiwan was welcomed and valued by people and politicians of all countries who longed for the easing of the Far East situation. Even some people who had previously leaned towards the Chiang Kai-shek clique believed that Premier Zhou Enlai's statement opened the door to the peaceful liberation of Taiwan. However, the U.S. ruling clique felt very panicked. It feared that the peaceful liberation of Taiwan would cause it to lose Taiwan as a war base and that the situation in Asia and the world would further ease as a result. The "New York Times" once clamored that "the significance of Premier Zhou Enlai's recent efforts must not be ignored." The Washington "Star" also demanded that "some special precautions be taken" to prevent the peaceful liberation of Taiwan.

Nixon's mission in visiting Taiwan was to ask the Chiang Kai-shek clique to adhere to a position hostile to the Chinese people and to obstruct the Taiwan authorities from conducting negotiations with the Chinese government on the peaceful liberation of Taiwan. When Nixon left Taiwan, he openly stated that he was "particularly concerned" in his talks with the Chiang Kai-shek clique about obtaining the Chiang Kai-shek clique's reaction to the Chinese government's new ideas on the peaceful liberation of Taiwan.

Nixon also publicly announced that the United States has no intention of holding a Sino-U.S. foreign ministers' meeting to seek an easing of the situation in the Taiwan region. This shows the real reason why the Sino-U.S. talks in Geneva have been protracted and without result.

Nixon's activities and remarks prove that the United States is deliberately trying to occupy Taiwan, separate Taiwan from China, and plunge China into division. The United States not only does not want to withdraw its troops from the Taiwan region and does not want to hold diplomatic negotiations with China to ease the situation in Taiwan, but also tries its best to openly interfere in China's internal affairs and prevent the Taiwan authorities from conducting negotiations with the Chinese government on the peaceful liberation of Taiwan. Who is creating tension and unrest in Asia, who is indulging in threats of force and unwilling to resolve disputes peacefully, and who is obstructing the peaceful liberation of Taiwan are now all clear.

However, Nixon even wants to slander China for carrying out "activities that create artificial divisions" in Asia and for "opposing all existing independent and free governments in Asia." Nixon clearly belongs to the Dulles type of person, fantasizing that every word of American politicians will be regarded as a golden rule by the Asian people. In fact, the Chinese people and the Asian people have long seen through the truth of the U.S. policy of aggression and interference, and the development of history will never proceed according to the wishes of these politicians.

### 尼克松台湾之行说明了什么

    尼克松台湾之行说明了什么
    美国副总统尼克松在七、八两日访问了台湾，并和蒋介石集团举行了会谈。尼克松的这次访问，再度表明美国打算长期侵占台湾，阻挠台湾地区紧张局势的缓和。
    尼克松这次访问台湾，是在周恩来总理在第一届全国人民代表大会第三次会议上表示愿意同台湾当局协商和平解放台湾的具体步骤和条件以后，由华盛顿临时决定的。周恩来总理的关于和平解放台湾问题的发言，受到了渴望和缓远东局势的各国人民和政界人士的欢迎和重视。就是某些曾经倾向于蒋介石集团的人，也认为周恩来总理的发言给和平解放台湾打开了大门。但是美国统治集团却感到非常恐慌，它害怕台湾的和平解放将使它丧失台湾这样一个战争基地，害怕亚洲和世界局势因此而进一步缓和下来。“纽约时报”就曾经叫嚷说：“决不能忽视周恩来总理最近这次努力的意义。”华盛顿“明星报”并且要求“采取一些特殊的预防办法”，来防止台湾的和平解放。
    尼克松访问台湾的任务，就是要求蒋介石集团坚持同中国人民敌对的立场，阻挠台湾当局同中国政府进行关于和平解放台湾的谈判。尼克松在离开台湾的时候公开表示，他在同蒋介石集团会谈中“特别关心”的，是获得蒋介石集团对于中国政府关于和平解放台湾的新意见的反应。
    尼克松还公开宣布，美国无意举行中美外长会议，来谋求台湾地区局势的缓和。这就说明了日内瓦中美会谈长期拖延而没有结果的真正原因。
    尼克松的活动和言论证明：美国蓄意要侵占台湾，把台湾从中国割裂出去，使中国陷于分裂。美国不但自己不想从台湾地区撤走它的军队，不想同中国举行外交谈判来和缓台湾局势，而且还想尽办法公开干涉中国的内政，不让台湾当局同中国政府进行和平解放台湾的谈判。究竟是谁在亚洲制造紧张和不安，是谁在沉缅于武力威胁而不愿意用和平办法解决争端，是谁在阻挠台湾的和平解放，现在都是一清二楚的了。
    可是，尼克松却居然还想诬蔑中国在亚洲进行什么“造成人为的分裂的活动”，诬蔑中国“反对全亚洲现存的独立自由的政府”。尼克松显然属于杜勒斯那一类型的人，幻想着美国政客的每一句话都会被亚洲人民当作金科玉律。其实中国人民和亚洲人民早已看穿了美国的侵略和干涉政策的真相，历史的发展是绝不会按着这些政客们的愿望进行的。
