    Sunday "Occupied"

    Sunday is supposed to be a day of rest, but in some factories and mines, the Sundays of workers are "occupied" by all sorts of meetings.

    Lu Yuming, a female worker at the Liuzhou Dyeing and Weaving Factory in Guangxi, holds five positions simultaneously and hardly gets any rest on Sundays. One Sunday, Lu Yuming went to the Communist Youth League class as soon as she got up; as soon as the League class ended, she rushed to the Workers' Newspaper to attend the correspondent meeting. After returning, there were three more meetings waiting for her: Communist Youth League group meeting, Communist Youth League branch meeting, and workshop analysis meeting. Then, there were administrative group meetings and employee meetings. According to Lu Yuming, this kind of life is commonplace. Because there are too many meetings, she doesn't even have time to wash her own clothes, let alone think about going to plays, movies, or parks.

    It is hoped that relevant units will rationally arrange time, reduce some meetings, and allow the majority of workers to rest on Sundays. Sun Benjie

    星期天被“占用”了
    星期天本来是休息的日子，但是，有的厂矿职工的星期天被各色各样的会议“占用”了。
    广西柳州染织厂女工卢玉明身兼五职，差不多每个星期天都得不到休息。有一个星期天，卢玉明刚一起床便去上团课；团课刚一结束，就赶快跑到工人报社参加通讯员会议。回来后，又有三个会等着她：团小组会、团分支会、车间分析会。接着，又是行政小组会和职工大会。据卢玉明说：这样的生活已经是家常便饭了。因为会议太多，连自己的衣服也没有时间洗，至于看戏、看电影、逛公园等等，更没有工夫去想了。
    希望有关单位合理安排时间，减少一些会议，让广大劳动者在星期天得到休息。　孙本杰
