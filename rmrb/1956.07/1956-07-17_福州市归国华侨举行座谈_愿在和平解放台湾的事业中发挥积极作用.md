Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, July 16th: Fuzhou's returned Overseas Chinese held a forum on the evening of the 15th to discuss the issue of liberating Taiwan.

This forum was convened by the Fuzhou Overseas Chinese Friendship Association.

Zeng Jianping, a returned Overseas Chinese from Malaya who formerly served as the Director of the Taiwan Broadcasting Station and a professor at National Taiwan University, and is now a professor at Fujian Normal College, said that the glory of the motherland is also the glory of Overseas Chinese. The vast number of Overseas Chinese are willing to play an active role in the cause of the peaceful liberation of Taiwan. He hopes that his old colleagues in Taiwan will quickly join the patriotic ranks and contribute to the cause of the peaceful liberation of Taiwan.

Ye Hongbao, a returned Overseas Chinese who served as an inspector in the Fujian Provincial Department of Education of the Kuomintang when he was in China, and as the chairman of the Yogyakarta Chinese General Association in Indonesia, and is now a member of the Fuzhou Municipal People's Political Consultative Conference, said that the peaceful liberation of Taiwan is the greatest wish of Overseas Chinese. Premier Zhou Enlai's solemn call will surely be supported by Overseas Chinese abroad.

Chen Zhiting, an octogenarian returned Overseas Chinese, was unable to attend the meeting in person due to health reasons, but he submitted a written statement to the meeting. He stated that the Chinese people have the strength to liberate Taiwan. The Chiang Kai-shek clique in Taiwan cannot last by relying on American imperialism. Kuomintang military and political personnel in Taiwan should quickly distinguish right from wrong and make contributions to the peaceful liberation of Taiwan. Guo Shouzhen, a returned Overseas Chinese from Malaya who is currently a professor at Fujian Normal College, and Yang Yinxiang, a returned Overseas Chinese from Indonesia who is currently the deputy director of the joint state-private New Overseas Chinese Store, both expressed in their speeches the hope that Kuomintang military and political personnel in Taiwan or abroad would no longer hesitate. They said that as long as they return to the embrace of the motherland, they will surely receive the trust and care of the people.

    福州市归国华侨举行座谈
    愿在和平解放台湾的事业中发挥积极作用
    新华社福州16日电　十五日晚上，福州市归国华侨集会座谈解放台湾问题。
    这个座谈会是福州市华侨联谊会召集。
    曾任台湾广播电台总台台长、台湾大学教授，现任福建师范学院教授的马来亚归国华侨曾建平说，祖国的光荣也就是华侨的光荣。广大华侨都愿意在和平解放台湾的事业中发挥积极的作用。他希望在台湾的老同事们赶快站到爱国行列中来，为和平解放台湾的事业作出贡献。
    在国内时当过国民党福建省教育厅视导员、在印度尼西亚时当过日惹中华总会主席、现任福州市政协委员的归国华侨叶鸿宝说，和平解放台湾，是华侨的最大愿望，周恩来总理的这一庄严号召，一定会得到海外华侨的拥护。
    八十多岁的归国华侨陈芷汀因为健康的关系没有能亲自到会，他向会议作了书面发言。他表示，中国人民有力量解放台湾。台湾蒋介石集团依靠美帝国主义是不能持久的。台湾国民党军政人员应快快明辨是非，为和平解放台湾建立功勋。现任福建师范学院教授的马来亚归国华侨郭寿镇和现任公私合营新侨商店副主任的印度尼西亚归国华侨杨银仙等人，在发言中都希望在台湾或去国外的国民党军政人员不要再徘徊瞻顾。他们说，只要投到祖国怀抱，一定能得到人民的信赖和照顾。
