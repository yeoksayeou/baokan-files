    Suburban Vegetable Bumper Harvest Steadily Supplies the Market
    (Our newspaper reports) In July, vegetable production in the suburbs of the capital has entered its peak season. Currently, many agricultural cooperatives growing vegetables are steadily supplying the market with large quantities of fresh and tender tomatoes, eggplants, cucumbers, zucchini, potatoes, onions, green beans, and other major vegetables. The Dongfanghong Cooperative in Fengtai District alone (a vegetable production cooperative with more than 2,500 households) recently put more than thirty varieties of vegetables on the market, with a daily supply of more than 300,000 jin, reaching a maximum of 500,000 to 600,000 jin. The people of the capital can enjoy the most complete variety and the cheapest fresh vegetables during this season.
    This year, the rainy season came earlier and the rainfall was heavier, which affected the growth of some vegetables. However, agricultural production cooperatives have improved cultivation techniques, implemented increased production cultivation regulations for major vegetables, and strengthened field management. Therefore, the vast majority of spring and summer vegetables have increased production this year. The tomatoes currently being harvested are expected to see an overall increase in production. The Longzhaoshu area in Nan Yuan District, with forty-five mu of tomatoes, is estimated to have a yield of more than 10,000 jin per mu. Potatoes are now being harvested in large quantities, and overall production is also increasing. The Shuguang Cooperative in Xihongmen Township, Nan Yuan District, harvested 844.5 mu of potatoes, with an average yield of 2,500 jin per mu, an increase of more than double compared to 1955. The 2.2 mu of high-yield experimental land for potatoes in the Fenzhuang East Second Team of this cooperative yielded 6,702 jin per mu, and the 7.467 mu of high-yield land in the Panjiamiao South Team yielded more than 5,600 jin per mu, both exceeding the highest yields in the suburbs of Beijing.

    郊区蔬菜丰收源源供应市场
    本报讯　七月，首都郊区的蔬菜生产进入了旺季。现在，种植蔬菜的许多农业社正把大量鲜嫩的西红柿、茄子、黄瓜、西葫芦、土豆、洋葱、菜豆等主要蔬菜源源供应市场。仅丰台区东方红社（一个二千五百多户的蔬菜生产社）最近上市的蔬菜就有三十多种，每天上市量三十多万斤，最多时达五十万到六十万斤。首都人民在这个季节里可以吃到种类最全价格最便宜的鲜菜。
    今年雨季到来较早，雨量也较大，影响了某些蔬菜的生长。但是各农业生产合作社改进了栽培技术，贯彻执行了主要蔬菜的增产耕作规程，加强了田间管理，因此今年春夏季蔬菜绝大部分是增产的。正在收获的西红柿能够全面增产。南苑区龙爪树四十五亩西红柿，估计每亩产量可超过一万斤。土豆现正大量刨收，总的看来也是增产的，南苑区西红门乡曙光社844.5亩土豆，平均每亩产二千五百斤，比1955年增产一倍多。这个社汾庄东二队二点二亩丰产试验地的土豆，每亩产6，702斤，潘家庙南队7.467亩丰产地每亩产五千六百多斤，都超过了京郊的最高产量。（鲁仁庆）
