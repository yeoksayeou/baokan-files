Xinhua News Agency, July 24th, Tass, Cairo, July 23rd: July 23rd is Egypt's National Day—the fourth anniversary of the July 23, 1952 revolution. The government decided to declare July 23rd as a holiday. Newspapers reported that mass celebrations were held throughout the country to celebrate National Day.

The newspapers published articles and materials introducing the achievements made by Egypt in the four years since the establishment of the new regime. The newspapers proudly wrote that the Egyptian people are celebrating the fourth anniversary of the revolution at a time when the country has been completely liberated, has gotten rid of foreign occupation, and has strengthened Egypt's national independence and political autonomy. As a warrior for peace, peaceful coexistence, and resolute opposition to imperialist covenants and imperialist blocs, Egypt's international prestige is constantly increasing.

The "Republic News" editorial wrote: "We defeated the reactionaries and traitors. We resisted imperialism and drove the colonialists out of the country. We got rid of foreign influence and Western control. We have achieved complete freedom." The newspaper wrote that because Egypt implemented a policy of defending peace and independence, it has gained many reliable friends in other countries.

The newspaper went on to write that Egypt's enemies "attempted to hinder Egypt from following its own path and set up various obstacles on its path." "We know that in order to defend our national independence, we must vigorously fight against the forces of imperialism. This struggle requires us to have tenacity, perseverance, and a spirit of sacrifice. We are prepared to carry out this struggle.

"News" wrote, "Egypt has recognized People's China and strengthened ties with all countries with different political systems." The newspaper finally pointed out, "Egypt's foreign policy is based on the principle of peaceful coexistence among all countries."
