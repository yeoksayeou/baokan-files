The slogan "Marching towards science" has resounded throughout the country, and the broad masses of technical personnel are all eager to make contributions. However, many technical personnel in the No. 2 Thin Plate Plant of Anshan Iron and Steel Company have become demoralized instead.

What is the reason for this?

Is it that they have no ambition to march towards science? No, they are also full of enthusiasm to do more for the country. Could it be that Anshan Iron and Steel Company has no unresolved scientific problems that need them to tackle? That is not the case either. The science and technology of the iron and steel industry are changing with each passing day, and Anshan Iron and Steel Company is the largest iron and steel enterprise in the country, with many categories and complex technologies. How many scientific and technological problems need to be solved by technical personnel!

The No. 2 Thin Plate Plant is the unit in the Anshan Iron and Steel rolling system with the most technical personnel. However, the No. 2 Thin Plate Plant's use of them is not appropriate. The six technicians in the hot rolling section only undertake the work that two technicians can handle. Many technicians are doing purely non-technical work, such as collecting labor protection products, counting materials, collecting materials, and compiling statistical reports. The work of technical personnel is often transferred. Technician Zhong Shuxiu has only been in the factory for two years, but has been transferred six times. As for those who have been transferred three or four times in a short period, there are even more.

On the one hand, the potential of technical personnel cannot be fully utilized, and on the other hand, there are many technical tasks that no one is responsible for, or lack technical strength to solve well. The annealing work in the finishing section is a weak link in the factory, but the leadership does not consider putting technician Jin Jingying, who once studied annealing technology in the Soviet Union, in this position. The quality of the factory's products in the first quarter was not good, and the first-class product rate dropped to 61%, but the leadership did not organize and promote technical personnel to study improvements.

No one cares about the professional and technical improvement of young technical personnel. When the factory holds meetings on product quality, new product trial production, and technical issues explained by Soviet experts, technicians are often excluded. Due to the limitations of the confidentiality system, many technical materials cannot be taken back to the dormitory to read at night, and no learning is organized during the day. Li Guobin and other five technicians in the galvanizing section have been troubled by the lack of leadership in their work for a long time. They wrote a joint letter to the factory director in June last year, requesting a meeting to study, but there has been no response until now. In March of this year, all the technicians in Class C proposed to launch a socialist labor competition among the technical personnel in the entire factory, but they were treated coldly by the factory leaders. This proposal naturally died.

Young technicians are very keen to learn, but the leadership has not arranged a minimum learning environment for them. Seven or eight technicians in the second, third, and fifteenth dormitories are squeezed into a small room with only one small two-drawer table. Whoever returns first occupies it, and other comrades can only sit on the bed and write materials against their knees or lie down and read books. Technicians on the long day shift also live with workers on three shifts, which affects each other, and even normal sleep time cannot be guaranteed.

Zhang Weiming, the director of the No. 2 Thin Plate Plant, not only does not check and improve his own work, but instead says: "There are indeed many technical personnel in our factory, who are fully capable of solving some problems in quality and technology, but they are not active and do not study hard." What an unreasonable accusation!

    技术人员的苦闷
    荣清玉　吴晋翔
    “向科学进军”的口号响遍全国，广大的技术人员都是磨拳擦掌、跃跃欲试。然而，鞍山钢铁公司第二薄板厂的许多技术人员反而情绪低落下来。
    这是什么缘故呢？
    难道他们无志于向科学进军吗？不是的，他们也是满腔热情地想替国家作更多的事。莫非鞍山钢铁公司没有什么悬而未决的科学课题需要他们去进军？也不是的，钢铁工业的科学技术日新月异，鞍山钢铁公司又是全国最大的钢铁企业，门类繁多、技术复杂，不知多少科学技术上的问题需要技术人员去解决呵！
    第二薄板厂是鞍钢轧钢系统中技术人员配备最多的单位，但是第二薄板厂对他们的使用是不够恰当的。热轧工段的六个技术员只担负了两个技术员就能胜任的工作。不少技术员做着纯粹非技术性的工作，如领取劳动保护品、盘料、领料、统计表报等。技术人员的工作经常调动，技术员钟淑秀来厂不过两年，已经被调动了六次，至于短期内调动三、四次的为数更多。
    一方面技术人员的潜力不能得到充分发挥，另一方面却有不少技术工作无人负责，或者缺乏技术力量不能很好地解决。精整工段的退火工作是厂内的薄弱环节，可是领导上不考虑把曾经到苏联学习过退火技术的金镜映技术员放到这个岗位上去。这个厂第一季度的产品质量不好，一级品率降到61％，但是领导上也没有组织和推动技术人员去研究改进。
    对青年技术人员业务上和技术上的提高更是无人关心。工厂召开有关产品质量、新产品试制和苏联专家讲解的技术性问题的会议的时候，技术员往往是被拒之于门外的。不少技术资料因受保密制度的限制，晚上不能带回宿舍去看，白天又不组织学习。镀锌工段李国彬等五个技术员苦于在工作中长期无人领导，曾在去年六月联名写信给厂长，要求召开会议研究，但是直到现在也没有答复。今年三月，丙班的全体技术员提出在全厂技术人员中开展社会主义劳动竞赛的倡议，也受到厂领导上的冷淡待遇。这个倡议自然也就夭折了。
    青年技术员们的学习劲头都很大，但是领导上没有为他们安排起码的学习环境。第二、第三、第十五宿舍的技术员七八个人挤在一间小屋里，屋内只有一个两屉小桌，谁先回去谁占用，其他同志只能坐在床上靠着膝盖写材料或躺着看书。长白班的技术员还和三班倒的工人住在一起，彼此互相影响，连正常的睡眠时间都没法保证。
    第二薄板厂厂长张维明不但不检查和改进自己的工作，反而说：“我们厂里技术人员的确很多，满能够解决质量上和技术上的一些问题，不过就是不积极，不钻研。”这是多么不近人情的指责呵！
