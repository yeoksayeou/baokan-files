Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, July 13th: A joint communiqué on the talks between the Soviet government and the Korean government delegation, issued on July 12th, stated that both sides noted with satisfaction that the Korean armistice played a significant role in easing tensions in Asia and worldwide. Both sides stated that they will continue to work with all peace-loving forces to achieve a peaceful resolution of the Korean question and to transform the Korean armistice into a lasting peace.

   Given that the concern for a peaceful resolution of the Korean question is not limited to the people of Korea and its neighboring countries, both sides support the proposal to convene an international conference of relevant countries to peacefully resolve the Korean question and to discuss the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korean territory.

   The joint communiqué was signed by Chairman of the Soviet Council of Ministers Nikolai Bulganin and Premier of the Korean Cabinet Kim Il-sung. The communiqué announced that the Korean government delegation, headed by Kim Il-sung, visited Moscow from July 6th to 12th at the invitation of the Soviet government, and held talks with Soviet government leaders in a sincere and friendly atmosphere. The two sides extensively and frankly discussed issues concerning the further strengthening and development of friendly relations and cooperation between the Soviet Union and Korea, as well as important international issues of mutual concern.

   The communiqué stated that further expanding the comprehensive friendly ties between the Soviet Union and Korea, which are developing smoothly, is in the interests of the two peoples and helps to consolidate world peace, especially peace and security in the Far East. The two sides share a completely unified view in their assessment of the most important international issues. Both sides reaffirmed their willingness to continue cooperating for the benefit of their people and for the benefit of consolidating peace and security.

   Both sides believe that their joint efforts with other peace-loving countries will help to ease international tensions and consolidate world peace.

   Both sides affirmatively pointed out that the initiatives of the Soviet Union, Korea, and other people's democratic countries in the area of disarmament are a significant contribution to the cause of consolidating peace and security.

   The two sides exchanged views on the measures taken by the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to develop contact with South Korea in affairs, economy, and culture, and to promote free movement between North and South Korea. Both sides regret that these measures have not yet received due attention from the South Korean authorities. The two governments believe that the establishment of direct contact and the establishment of economic, cultural, and other ties between the two parts of Korea will help create practical conditions for the peaceful reunification of Korea.

   The communiqué continued by saying that during the talks, the two sides also discussed the issue of further expanding economic and technical cooperation between the Soviet Union and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. The Soviet Union decided to increase the supply of materials, equipment, food, and daily necessities to Korea for the restoration and further development of the national economy. For example, it will help expand the production capacity of the Hungnam Mineral Fertilizer Factory in Korea. Most of the supplementary supplied materials will be provided as fraternal assistance.

   The Soviet and Korean governments noted with satisfaction that close ties have been established between the two countries in the fields of culture and science. In the future, both sides will continue to encourage comprehensive cultural exchanges between the two countries. To this end, both sides agreed to sign a cultural cooperation agreement in the near future.

    苏朝两国政府发表联合公报
    双方支持就和平解决朝鲜问题召开国际会议
    决定进一步扩大两国在经济文化方面的合作
    新华社莫斯科13日电　七月十二日，苏联政府和朝鲜政府代表团发表一项关于会谈的联合公报说，双方满意地指出，朝鲜停战在缓和亚洲和全世界的紧张局势方面起了重大的作用。双方表示，它们将同一切和平力量一起继续努力，以使朝鲜问题得到和平解决，把朝鲜停战变为持久和平。
    鉴于关心朝鲜问题的和平解决的，并不限于朝鲜和它的邻国的人民，双方支持这种主张：就和平解决朝鲜问题和一切外国军队撤出朝鲜领土的问题，召开有关国家的国际会议。
    这个联合公报是由苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁和朝鲜内阁首相金日成签署的。公报宣布，以金日成为首的朝鲜政府代表团，应苏联政府的邀请，从七月六日到十二日在莫斯科访问，并且和苏联政府领导人在恳切友好的气氛中进行了会谈，双方广泛地、坦率地讨论了关于进一步加强和发展苏联和朝鲜之间的友好关系和合作的问题，以及双方关心的一些重要的国际问题。
    公报说，进一步扩大顺利发展中的苏朝两国的全面的友好联系，符合于两国人民的利益，有助于巩固世界和平，特别是远东的和平和安全。双方在对最重要的国际问题的估计方面，看法是完全一致的。双方重申为自己人民的利益和为巩固和平和安全的利益而继续合作的愿望。
    双方相信，它们同其他爱好和平国家的共同努力将有助于缓和国际紧张局势和巩固世界和平。
    双方肯定地指出，苏联、朝鲜和其他人民民主国家在裁军方面的主动精神，是对巩固和平和安全的事业的重大贡献。
    双方就朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府为了发展同南朝鲜在事务、经济和文化方面的联系，以及为了南北朝鲜之间的自由来往而采取的措施交换了意见。双方遗憾地指出，这些措施至今还没有受到南朝鲜当局的应有注意。两国政府认为，直接接触的建立以及朝鲜两个部分之间的经济、文化和其他联系的建立，将有助于为和平统一朝鲜创造实际的条件。
    公报接着说，在会谈中，双方还讨论了进一步扩大苏联和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国在经济上和技术上的合作问题。苏联决定向朝鲜增加供应用于恢复和进一步发展国民经济的物资、设备、粮食和日用品。例如，将帮助扩大朝鲜兴南矿质肥料工厂的生产能力。在补充供应的物资中，大部分将作为兄弟援助。
    苏联政府和朝鲜政府满意地指出，两国之间建立了密切的文化和科学的联系。双方今后还将鼓励两国全面的文化交流，为此，双方同意在最近期间签订一项文化合作协定。
