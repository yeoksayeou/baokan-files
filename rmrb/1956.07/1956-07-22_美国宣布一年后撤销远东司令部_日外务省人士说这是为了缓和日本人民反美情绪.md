Xinhua News Agency, Washington, July 20th: The U.S. Department of Defense announced on July 18th a measure to adjust the U.S. military command structure in the Pacific and Far East: dissolve the Far East Command based in Japan, move the so-called "United Nations Command" from Japan to South Korea, and place all U.S. troops stationed in the Pacific and Far East regions under the command of Admiral Stump's Pacific Command based in Hawaii.

The reorganization of the U.S. military command will take effect on July 1st next year. It is revealed that the U.S. is doing this to change the current situation of excessively dispersed power, strengthen U.S. military forces in key areas such as Taiwan and Okinawa, and ultimately concentrate all U.S. Army, Navy, and Air Force units in the Pacific region under the command of a single command. Currently, U.S. troops stationed in Okinawa, Japan, and South Korea are under the command of the Far East Command, while other areas in the Pacific are under the command of the Pacific Command.

A U.S. Department of Defense spokesman emphasized that this reorganization of the command structure does not mean that the number of U.S. troops stationed in the Far East will be reduced. At the same time, according to the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty, a small-scale U.S. military headquarters will still be located in Tokyo. Its mission is to "cooperate" with the Japanese military forces.

Xinhua News Agency, July 20th: According to International News Service reports, Japanese Foreign Ministry officials believe that the U.S. announcement to withdraw the U.S. military command from Japan is to "alleviate the growing anti-American sentiment among the Japanese people." These officials pointed out that the unresolved land issue on Okinawa, the anti-base struggles of the Japanese people, and the abnormal presence of U.S. troops are the reasons for the anti-American sentiment among the Japanese.

Japanese Foreign Minister Shigemitsu reported at today's cabinet meeting on the dissolution of the U.S. Far East Command, saying: "The Foreign Ministry has received official notification that the dissolution of the command is purely a matter of military organization, and the joint defense system established in accordance with the (U.S.-Japan) Security Treaty will not be weakened as a result." In addition, Defense Agency Director General Funada made the following explanation: "This reform of the U.S. military organization will not create any obstacles to strengthening the Self-Defense Forces plan and the existing defense cooperation system between the Self-Defense Forces and the U.S. military."

    美国宣布一年后撤销远东司令部
    日外务省人士说这是为了缓和日本人民反美情绪
    新华社20日讯　华盛顿消息：美国国防部七月十八日宣布了一项调整美国在太平洋和远东的军事司令部的措施：撤销设在日本的远东司令部，把所谓“联合国军司令部”从日本移到南朝鲜，并且把驻在太平洋和远东地区的全部美国军队划归斯图普海军上将率领的设在夏威夷的太平洋司令部指挥。
    美军司令部的调整将在明年七月一日生效。据透露，美国这样做的目的是为了改变目前权力过于分散的状况，加强像台湾和冲绳这样关键性的地区的美国军事力量，最后将使整个太平洋地区的美国陆、海、空军集中在一个司令部的指挥之下。在目前，美国驻在冲绳、日本和南朝鲜一带的军队是由远东司令部指挥的，太平洋其他地区是由太平洋司令部指挥的。
    美国国防部发言人强调，这次司令部的改组绝不意味着美国驻在远东的部队人数会有所减少。同时，根据美日安全条约，东京将仍然设有一个小规模的美军总部。它的任务是同日本的军事部队“合作”。
    据新华社20日讯　据国际新闻社报道，日本外务省人士认为，美国宣布把美军司令部撤出日本是为了“缓和日本人民日益增长的反美情绪”。这些人士指出，未解决的冲绳岛土地问题、日本人民的反基地斗争和美国军队不正常的驻留是日本人形成反美情绪的原因。
    日本外务相重光今天在内阁会议上就远东美军司令部被撤销一事作报告说：“外务省已经接到正式通知，司令部的撤销是纯粹军事编制上的问题，按照（日美）安全条约建立起来的共同防御体系将不会因此而有所削弱”。此外，防卫厅长官船田作了这样的说明：“这次美军的机构改革对加强自卫队计划和现有的自卫队和美军之间的防御合作制度不会发生任何障碍。”
