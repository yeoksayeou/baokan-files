    A Day at the Labor Exchange
    In the morning, the benches in the corridors of the labor exchange are full of people. Some have just received notice that they are going to new jobs today; some are here to register for work; and some are here to find people to work.
    Deng Guichun is taking up his post for the first time today. Before seven o'clock, he came here to wait for assignment. He went into the office in charge of liaison work and took out his notification letter. The comrade in charge of this work said to him: "Go to the Central Academy of Arts and Crafts, they need a car driver." Deng Guichun took the letter of introduction with a smile. Deng Guichun is nineteen years old this year. His parents are old, and his four younger sisters are still young, so he needs to work to support the family. Originally, he did not have employment conditions, but he found an opportunity to learn to drive a car. More than two months ago, he took the exam at the Municipal Public Security Bureau and obtained a driver's license.
    At half past nine, two soldiers came to the office in charge of liaison work. They were from the Air Force Headquarters and came here to request the introduction of female telephone operators. One of them took out several forms from his briefcase, stating that the seven housewives introduced from here were ready to be hired, pending a final decision after a physical examination. He hopes to introduce three more female telephone operators.
    A middle-aged woman came to the registration office to request employment. The comrades in the registration office learned that she was a housewife who had to take care of all the housework for a family of eight. If she participates in work, it will definitely affect her husband's work and raising children. Therefore, they patiently gave this woman an educational explanation of "family labor is equally glorious," and finally made her go home satisfied.

    劳动力介绍所的一天
    早晨，在劳动力介绍所的走廊长椅上坐满了人。他们有的是刚接到通知，今天要到新的岗位上去工作；有的是来登记找工作的；也有人是来找人去工作的。
    邓贵春今天是第一次走上工作岗位。不到七点，他就来到这里等分配了。他走进了负责接洽工作的办公室，拿出了通知信。负责这项工作的同志对他说：“你到中央工艺美术学院去吧，那里需要一个汽车司机。”邓贵春笑嘻嘻地拿着介绍信走了。邓贵春今年十九周岁，他的父母都已年老，四个妹妹又还年幼，生活需要他参加工作。原来他没有就业条件，但是他自己找机会学会了开汽车，两个多月前，他在市公安局考试，得到了汽车驾驶执照。
    九点半钟，两个军人来到负责接洽工作的办公室。他们是空军司令部的，来这里要求介绍女话务员。其中一个人从皮包里拿出几张表格，说明从这里介绍去的七个家庭妇女已准备录用，只等体格检查后作最后确定。他希望再介绍三个女话务员。
    一个中年妇女来到了登记处要求就业。登记处的同志了解到她是一个要操劳全家八口人家务事的家庭主妇。她若是参加工作，一定要影响到她丈夫的工作和抚养孩子。于是，他们耐心地对这位妇女进行了“家庭劳动同样光荣”的说明教育，终于使她满意地回家去了。
