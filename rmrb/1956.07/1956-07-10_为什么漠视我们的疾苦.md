    Why Disregard Our Suffering

    The Chain Bucket No. 1 dredging vessel of the Hankou Navigation Engineering Area of the Yangtze River Navigation Administration is a very important vessel responsible for dredging the river channel in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River. The workload is heavy and the work is intense. However, the workers cannot find a place to rest and have to sleep in the engine room at night. The engine room of the dredger is the hottest place, even in winter the temperature is around 90 degrees Fahrenheit. It is even hotter in the summer and it's impossible to sleep soundly, so many people sleep outside the cabin. Rainy days are the worst, it’s hot inside and you can't sleep, and it's raining outside. The workers have requested that their superiors provide a dormitory ship, but have not received a reply. Because there is no place to rest, many people get sick and do not receive timely treatment.

    The workers work in the river every day, so in principle everyone should have a life jacket. However, we have very few life jackets, and every time we set sail, we have to grab for them. Those who can't get a life jacket are worried and afraid of drowning if an accident occurs while working. The workers raised this issue as early as 1954 and asked the leaders to solve it, but it has not been resolved until now.

    The entire engineering area has sixty-five navigation mark stations. Some navigation mark stations have no buildings, and some are made of thatched grass. When it rains, five or six workers have to work holding umbrellas. Because there has been no place to shelter from the wind and rain for many years, many navigation mark personnel have contracted rheumatism. Navigation mark personnel work all day on small boats in the heart of the river, so in principle everyone should be issued a water bottle. However, the Yangtze River Navigation Administration believes that Yangtze River vessels "have no such precedent" and does not implement this regulation. Navigation mark personnel sometimes have to drink unclean river water. There are many similar examples.

    Last winter, Comrade Zou Ming, Director of the Yangtze River Navigation Administration, Comrade Zhu, Director of the Navigation Engineering Department, and other responsible comrades came to inspect the work and verbally promised to solve these problems. Now, a winter has passed, a spring has passed, and the scorching summer is coming again, but the problems remain unresolved. Have these responsible comrades forgotten about these issues as soon as they left the site? Whether they have forgotten or not, the leadership style of not caring about the suffering of the employees should be changed. (Zhú Yún)

### 为什么漠视我们的疾苦

    为什么漠视我们的疾苦
    长江航运管理局汉口航道工程区的链斗一号挖泥船，是长江中游担负疏通河道任务的一条很重要的船，工作量大，工作很紧张。但是，工人却找不到一个可以休息的地方，夜间也得睡在机舱里。挖泥船的机舱是温度最高的地方，即使在冬天，温度也在华氏九十度左右。夏天更热得没法安稳睡觉，许多人都在舱外睡。下雨天最糟糕，舱里热，睡不着，舱外又下雨。工人们要求上级配备个宿舍船，一直得不到答复。因为没有地方休息，很多人都患病，也得不到及时的治疗。
    工人们天天在河里工作，照理每人应有一件救生衣。但是，我们的救生衣很少，每次出航都抢救生衣，抢不着的人，工作的时候提心吊胆，害怕出了事故被淹死。这个问题早在1954年工人们就提出来请领导上解决，直到现在还没解决。
    全工程区有六十五个航标站。有的航标站没有站房，有的站房是茅草搭的，遇到下雨天，五、六个工人只得撑着伞工作。因为长年累月没有挡风避雨的地方，不少航标员得了风湿病。航标员整天在江心小划子上工作，照理每人可以发给一个饮水瓶。但长江航运管理局认为长江的船只“无此先例”，不执行这个规定，航标员有时只能喝不清洁的江水。类似这种事例还很多。
    去年冬天，长江航运管理局邹明局长、航道工程处祝处长等负责同志来视察工作的时候，曾口头答应一定解决这些问题。现在，一个冬天过去了，一个春天也过去了，酷热的夏天又来临了，问题依然没有解决。是不是这些负责同志一离开现场就把事情忘了呢？忘也好，不忘也好，不关心职工疾苦的领导作风总该改变了。　　（竹筠）
