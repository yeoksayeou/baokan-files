Xinhua News Agency, July 13th -- The Ministry of Supervision of the People's Republic of China issued an urgent notice to the Supervision Departments and Bureaus of all provinces (autonomous regions) and municipalities on July 11th regarding strengthening the supervision and inspection of flood control work.

The notice pointed out: Since the beginning of summer, there have been continuous heavy rains, and the water levels of rivers have risen sharply. Some areas have exceeded the warning water level, and some low-lying areas have accumulated water and become waterlogged. At present, the areas along rivers and lakes have launched intensive flood control work, and most supervisory agencies in these areas have also organized forces to supervise and inspect flood control work. It has been found that some areas have unsound flood control organizations, and cadres have paralysis and dependence; the quality of dikes in some areas is very poor, and they do not pay attention to maintenance; some areas have insufficient preparation and poor storage of flood control materials.

The notice pointed out that national supervisory agencies in areas along rivers and lakes must list the supervision and inspection of flood control work as the current top priority. The focus should be on checking whether the regional flood control organizations are sound; whether the quality of dikes, culverts, and sluice gates can guarantee safe passage through the flood peak; and whether flood control materials are sufficient and whether there is improper storage. In particular, it is necessary to check whether there is a risk of dam collapse in the small reservoirs built this year. In areas where floods have occurred, the focus should be on checking the rescue, relocation, and resettlement of disaster victims, and whether there are deaths due to illness or food shortages. In waterlogged areas, the focus should be on checking drainage, harvesting, and replanting work. At the same time, it is also necessary to urge factories, mines, and enterprises to make good preparations for flood control and rescue work after disasters.

The notice finally requested that national supervisory agencies in areas with flood control tasks must concentrate a certain amount of force under the unified leadership of the local Party and government, closely cooperate with relevant departments to conduct inspections, and should try their best to help solve the problems found during the inspections on the spot. Those who are derelict of duty, bureaucratic, coercive, violate laws and regulations, engage in corruption and theft, etc., should be dealt with in a timely manner according to the circumstances.

    加强对防汛工作的监督检查
    国家监察机关必须把这项工作列为当前首要任务
    新华社13日讯　中华人民共和国监察部十一日向各省（区）、市监察厅、局发出关于加强对防汛工作监督检查的紧急通知。
    通知指出：入夏以来，连降暴雨，江、河水位急剧上涨，有的地方超过警戒水位，有的低洼地区积水成涝。目前，沿江、沿河、沿湖地区已经开展了紧张的防汛工作，这些地区的大部监察机关也已组织力量对防汛工作进行监督检查。目前已发现有的地区防汛组织不健全，干部有麻痹依赖思想；有的地区的圩堤质量很差，又不注意养护工作；有的地区对防汛器材准备不足和保管不善。
    通知指出，沿江、沿河、沿湖地区国家监察机关必须把对防汛工作的监督检查列为当前的首要任务。要着重检查地区防汛组织是否健全；圩堤、涵闸、陡门的质量能否保证安度洪峰；防汛器材是否备足，有无保管不善等问题。尤其要检查今年兴修的小型水库有无倒坝的危险。对已发生水灾的地区，应着重检查对灾民的抢救、转移和安置工作，有无因病、缺粮而发生死亡的现象。对内涝地区，着重检查排涝、抢收、抢种工作，同时还要督促厂矿企业部门作好防汛准备工作和受灾后的抢救工作。
    通知最后要求有防汛任务地区的国家监察机关均须集中一定力量在当地党政统一领导下，密切配合有关部门进行检查，并应尽力就地帮助解决检查出的问题，对有怠忽职守、官僚主义、强迫命令、违法乱纪、贪污盗窃等行为者，应分别情况及时处理。
