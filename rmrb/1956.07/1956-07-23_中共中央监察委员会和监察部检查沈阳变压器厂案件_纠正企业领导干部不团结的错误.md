Xinhua News Agency, July 22nd. The main leading cadres of the state-owned Shenyang Transformer Factory, due to competition for personal power, were disunited with each other, damaged machinery, and abandoned leadership and supervision over production, resulting in serious losses to production. The CCP Central Supervisory Committee and the Ministry of Supervision of the People's Republic of China jointly investigated this case and made a "Report on the Investigation of the Shenyang Transformer Factory Case" and a "Decision on Handling the Case of Disunity Among Leading Cadres, Damage to Machinery, and Harm to Production at the Shenyang Transformer Factory." These two documents (see page four of today's newspaper) have been approved by the CCP Central Committee and the State Council.

According to the investigation by the CCP Central Supervisory Committee and the Ministry of Supervision, the main mistakes made by the state-owned Shenyang Transformer Factory in its work over the past few years are: massive damage and waste of state property, damage to machinery and equipment; one-sided pursuit of output, neglecting product quality, passing off substandard products as qualified products, deceiving the state and brother factories and mines; unfaithful implementation of state plans, engaging in deception to obtain honors and bonuses; failure to earnestly learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, refusal to implement the correct suggestions of Soviet experts, and arbitrary deletion and modification of Soviet technical data; the factory leadership had serious right-leaning paralysis and ideological problems, and leading cadres were disunited, etc.

The "Report on the Investigation of the Shenyang Transformer Factory Case" by the CCP Central Supervisory Committee and the Ministry of Supervision of the People's Republic of China pointed out that the main reason for this case was the serious bourgeois individualism of the factory's leading cadres; in order to compete for personal power, they undermined party unity, focused their main energy on infighting and mutual squeezing, and abandoned leadership and supervision over production; they used bourgeois management concepts to lead socialist enterprises, and engaged in deception in order to obtain personal honors and bonuses. The report emphasized that lessons should be learned from this case to strengthen the struggle against various unhealthy tendencies in factories and mines.

In the decision, relevant personnel were dealt with accordingly.

    中共中央监察委员会和监察部检查沈阳变压器厂案件  
    纠正企业领导干部不团结的错误
    新华社22日讯　国营沈阳变压器厂主要领导干部由于争夺个人权力，相互之间闹不团结，损坏机器，放弃了对生产的领导和监督，以致给生产造成严重的损失。中共中央监察委员会以及中华人民共和国监察部对这个案件联合进行了检查，并就检查的结果作出“关于检查国营沈阳变压器厂案件的报告”和“关于处理国营沈阳变压器厂领导干部闹不团结、损坏机器，危害生产案件的决定”。这两个文件（见今天本报第四版）已经中共中央和国务院批准。
    根据中共中央监察委员会和监察部的检查，国营沈阳变压器厂几年来在工作中所犯的主要错误是：大量损坏、浪费国家资财，损坏机器设备；片面地追求产量，忽视产品质量，以次品冒充合格品，欺骗国家和兄弟厂矿；不忠实执行国家计划，弄虚作假，骗取荣誉和奖金；不认真学习苏联的先进经验，拒绝执行苏联专家的正确建议，任意删改苏联技术资料；工厂领导上存在着严重的右倾麻痹思想，领导干部闹不团结等等。
    中共中央监察委员会和中华人民共和国监察部“关于检查国营沈阳变压器厂案件的报告”中指出，造成这一案件的主要原因，是这个厂的领导干部存在着严重的资产阶级个人主义思想；他们为了争夺个人权力而破坏党的团结，把自己的主要精力放在勾心斗角、互相倾轧上面，放弃了对生产的领导和监督；他们以资产阶级的经营观点来领导社会主义企业，为了骗取个人荣誉和奖金而弄虚作假。报告中着重指出，应该从这个案件中吸取教训，以加强反对工厂矿山企业中各种不良倾向的斗争。
    在决定中对有关人员作了处理。
