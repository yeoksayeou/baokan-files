Xinhua News Agency, 6th, London dispatch: British newspapers report that six million British workers, through their unions, have demanded wage increases. They declared their determination to defend and improve their living standards.

The Transport and General Workers' Union, with 1.3 million members, and the National Union of Railwaymen, with over 360,000 members, have recently put forward demands for wage increases.

The annual conference of the National Union of Mineworkers held in Ramsgate unanimously passed a resolution demanding wage increases in line with rising prices.

The National Craftsmens' Coordinating Committee of the British steel industry called on 14,000 steelworkers on July 4th to go on strike on July 14th to demand higher wages.

Joining the ranks of the movement demanding higher wages are: members of building cooperatives, foundry workers, boilermakers, and railway car workers, among others.

Prices are constantly rising in Britain, but the British government is insisting on implementing its policy of freezing wages, a situation that seriously threatens the lives of British working people. South Wales Miners' Union Chairman, Mr. Pinter, said that the wages of coal miners are completely insufficient to guarantee the minimum cost of living. The National Union of Railwaymen chairman, Mr. Stamford, also stressed that the living conditions of British workers are deteriorating due to rising prices, while company profits are rising sharply.

    物价不断上涨　生活条件恶化
    英国六百万工人要求增加工资
    新华社6日讯　伦敦消息：英国报纸报道，六百万英国工人已经通过他们的工会，提出增加工资的要求。他们宣布决心要保卫和改善他们的生活水准。
    拥有一百三十万会员的英国运输与普通工人工会和拥有三十六万多会员的英国全国铁路工人工会新近提出了增加工资的要求。
    在拉姆斯格特举行的全国矿工联盟年会一致通过决议，要求根据物价上涨情况来增加工资。
    英国钢铁业技术工人全国联合委员会七月四日号召一万四千名钢铁工人在七月十四日举行罢工，要求提高工资。
    参加到要求提高工资运动的行列中来的还有：建筑合作社社员、翻砂工人、锅炉制造工人和造车工人等。
    英国物价目前在不断上涨而英国政府却坚持执行它冻结工资的政策，这种情况严重地威胁着英国劳动人民的生活。南威尔士矿工联盟主席潘特尔说，煤矿工人的工资完全不足以保证最低生活费用。英国全国铁路工人工会主席史丹福德也强调指出，英国工人生活条件由于物价上涨而日益恶化，而公司的利润却在急剧上升。
