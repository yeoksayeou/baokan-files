    Instructions of the State Council on Several Issues in the Socialist Transformation of Private Industry, Commerce, Handicraft Industry, and Private Transportation Industry
    In January of this year, the socialist transformation movement of private industry, commerce, handicraft industry, and private transportation industry reached a climax across the country. Capitalist enterprises implemented the joint state-private ownership of entire industries, and individual laborers' enterprises achieved various degrees of cooperativization. Up to now, the number of people participating in the socialist transformation accounts for about 80% of private industry, commerce, handicraft industry, and private transportation industry. The transformation of private industry, commerce, handicraft industry, and private transportation industry from capitalist and individual production and management systems to joint state-private and cooperative production and management systems is a fundamental change in the relations of production and a great victory for socialist transformation in our country. The process of this socialist transformation was generally normal, with production and management proceeding normally in various regions and continuously improving. However, some chaotic phenomena occurred in many areas. There are still many problems to be solved in this transformation. Now, the State Council hereby issues the following instructions on several issues that need to be resolved at present:
      I. On the Issue of Business Arrangements for Small Vendors
    First, for small vendors who have not participated in the fixed-interest joint state-private shops and cooperative shops, they should be gradually, in stages, and by trade, be organized into cooperative groups that are independently managed and responsible for their own profits and losses under the principle of voluntariness and based on local conditions. This type of cooperative group is not only applicable to various industries in commerce but also to the catering and service industries. In terms of steps, it should start with difficult industries and households, and gradually expand.
    Second, state-owned commercial enterprises and supply and marketing cooperatives should designate one shop among state-owned shops, supply and marketing cooperative shops, and joint venture shops as the wholesale shop for each cooperative group to lead the cooperative group in business. The tasks of this wholesale shop for the cooperative group are: to be responsible for supplying goods; to borrow money from the bank on behalf of the group to solve financial difficulties; and to collect the taxes payable by the group members and pay them to the tax bureau on their behalf. In the future, the tax payment of the cooperative group should strictly implement the method of fixed tax amount with no changes for one year. The expenses of the wholesale shop shall be borne entirely by state-owned commercial enterprises and supply and marketing cooperatives and shall not be borne by the cooperative group.
    Third, state-owned commercial enterprises, supply and marketing cooperatives, joint venture shops, and cooperative shops should appropriately divide their work in the sales of goods. Some goods should be mainly allocated to cooperative groups. The wholesale and retail price differences of some goods should be expanded.
    Fourth, state-owned commercial enterprises and supply and marketing cooperatives should take responsibility and, according to the different income situations of small vendors in various places, distinguish between those who rely on commerce as their main income or those who use commerce as a supplementary income, and must ensure that all types of small vendors in various places can obtain the necessary income.
    Fifth, after implementing the above methods, if there are still difficulties in a certain place or industry, state-owned commercial enterprises and supply and marketing cooperatives can absorb some, merge some, or relocate some to other places, so as to completely settle small vendors.
    II. Issues Concerning Handicraft Production Cooperatives, Transportation Cooperatives, and Cooperative Shops
    First, the income of members of handicraft production cooperatives and transportation cooperatives should not be lower than their labor income before joining the cooperatives, and efforts should be made to increase their labor income compared to before cooperativization on the basis of improving production and management. The wages of members of cooperative shops should not be reduced if they are higher than those of state-owned shops and supply and marketing cooperative shops; those that are lower should be gradually and appropriately increased. In order to ensure that the labor income of members of the above-mentioned types of cooperative enterprises is not reduced, wages should be paid first each month, and then the amount of public accumulation funds should be determined based on the remaining surplus.
    Second, if members of the above-mentioned cooperative enterprises have reduced income and have difficulty in life due to joining the cooperative enterprises and request to withdraw from the cooperative enterprises, they should be allowed to withdraw, but it is absolutely not allowed to force them to withdraw. When they withdraw, their shares, including the means of production and cash, should be returned.
    Third, the products of handicraft production cooperatives that are produced and sold locally can be sold by themselves, but they must obey market management in terms of prices; those sold far away should be purchased by state-owned commercial enterprises or supply and marketing cooperatives, or sold by the production cooperatives themselves. Raw materials used by handicraft cooperatives can be purchased by themselves after being approved by the local government, but they are not allowed to raise prices to抢购(qiǎnggòu, rush to purchase); state-owned commercial enterprises and supply and marketing cooperatives should actively supply the required foreign raw materials. Various places must incorporate the production, supply, and sales plans of handicraft production cooperatives into local industrial plans.
    Fourth, the organizational form of transportation cooperatives should not be forced to be uniform. Do not force the organization of cooperatives where tools such as wooden sailboats and carts do not share profits. If a transportation cooperative has already been organized where the tools do not share profits, and the members request that the tools share profits, it should be changed to tool profit sharing. In order to meet the requirements of the members, it is also possible to form a cooperative group that unifies the distribution of goods, unifies freight rates, unifies deployment, and also has public accumulation.
    III. Appropriately Solve the Existing Problems for Small Business Owners
    First, for the houses of private enterprises that were originally factories and homes undivided, and shops and homes undivided, they should be dealt with according to the opinions of the owners after the implementation of joint state-private ownership. All houses connected to factories and houses connected to shops, if they are rented by the owners, should be renewed by the joint venture enterprise; if they are owned by the owners, then except for the original storefronts, factory buildings, and warehouses that should be inventoried and verified and become the assets of the joint venture enterprise, all other houses should belong to the owners. If the storefront has been returned to the original owner, it will no longer be changed.
    Second, among small business owners, those car owners and boat owners who lack labor and rely on means of production for their livelihood, must be absorbed into the enterprise and properly arranged after their vehicles and boats participate in the cooperative. When the small business owner's car is transferred to another place, generally the person goes with the car, and is arranged by the local transportation department; if the person cannot go to another place, the local transportation department is responsible for arranging according to their past income situation.
    Third, the method of handling the assets of small business owners' enterprises: If the small business owners' enterprises participate in joint state-private enterprises, or are changed to state-owned enterprises (such as grain stores, meat stores, etc.), their assets are handled according to the fixed-interest method. If small business owners' enterprises participate in cooperative shops, they will share dividends according to the shares according to the methods stipulated by the National Supply and Marketing Cooperative for cooperative shops. Some cooperative shops that have already implemented fixed interest can remain unchanged. If small business owners join handicraft production cooperatives or transportation cooperatives, and if the assets they invested exceed the fixed quota shares to be paid, and the handicraft production cooperatives or transportation cooperatives are unable to repay the assets exceeding the shares to be paid, then the assets exceeding the shares can be adopted by the method of pricing, depositing in the cooperative, and paying interest.
    Fourth, small business owners can serve as directors, supervisors, and other leadership positions within handicraft production cooperatives and transportation cooperatives. Their wages should be assessed according to technical standards and should not be discriminated against. Encourage skilled handicraft small business owners to take apprentices, and they should be given appropriate remuneration.
      IV. Issues Concerning Fixed Interest on Private Shares in Joint State-Private Enterprises and Issues Concerning Public-Private Relations
    First, the fixed interest rate for joint state-private enterprises nationwide, regardless of industry and commerce, size, profit or loss, region, industry, old or new joint ventures, is uniformly stipulated as 5%, that is, 5% per year. Individual enterprises that need to increase the interest rate can exceed 5%. If the interest rate of joint state-private enterprises that have already adopted the fixed-interest method in the past exceeds 5%, it will not be reduced; if the interest rate is less than 5%, it will be increased to 5%. The first and second quarterly private share interest for 1956 should be issued between July and August of this year.
    Second, the competent departments of industry and commerce should regularly convene meetings of public share representatives and private share representatives of joint venture enterprises separately, and sometimes also convene meetings of public and private representatives together to collect opinions, conduct education, and solve the difficulties they encounter in handling public-private relations. In order to ensure that the business guidelines, policies, and methods stipulated by the higher-level business departments are familiar to relevant personnel from both the public and private sectors, the business departments should be responsible for issuing these guidelines, policies, and methods, and should publish their main points in the newspaper as much as possible.
    Third, the leaders of the industry and commerce business departments at the central and provincial and municipal levels should respectively and periodically invite the responsible persons of the local Federation of Industry and Commerce, trade associations, and the China Democratic National Construction Association to hold symposiums to exchange opinions on various issues related to public-private relations. After the symposiums at the central and provincial and municipal levels are widely promoted and gain experience, they will gradually be promoted to county towns and market towns.
    Fourth, under the leadership of the competent business departments, widely absorb experienced leaders, employees, shop assistants of state-owned enterprises and private personnel to form business improvement committees for various industries to improve business work.
      V. Wage and Welfare Issues for Employees and Private Personnel
    First, the wages of employees and private personnel in joint state-private enterprises after the joint venture of the entire industry, if higher than the local equivalent wage standards of state-owned enterprises, will not be reduced. Those lower than the local wage standards of state-owned enterprises will be gradually increased in stages according to the production and business situation and the conditions of the enterprise. The relevant departments of the central government and local governments should submit a plan at the wage reform meeting in August of this year, and implement it after approval. The State Council has decided that the above-mentioned wage reform plan for joint state-private enterprises, regardless of the month it is implemented, the portion of the newly determined hourly wage standard that is higher than the current wage shall be retroactively paid from July 1, 1956.
    Second, production safety equipment and sanitary equipment in joint state-private enterprises should be gradually improved.
    Third, employees in joint state-private enterprises who have not yet implemented labor insurance should have their medical expenses and wages during sick leave resolved by the enterprises where they are located. Difficulties caused by medical treatment for private personnel should be helped. When the enterprise verifies assets, private personnel whose personal shares are less than 2,000 yuan should have their own medical treatment and wage payment methods during sick leave handled according to the treatment of employees of the enterprise. After the enterprise verifies assets, even if the personal shares exceed 2,000 yuan, as long as there are indeed difficulties, no matter how many shares they have, they can also be handled with reference to the treatment of employees of the enterprise. The current methods for medical treatment and wage payment during sick leave for private personnel that have already been handled according to employee treatment will not be changed. Joint state-private enterprises that originally had clinics should allow private personnel to seek medical treatment there like employees.
    VI. Enterprise Reorganization and Personnel Arrangement Issues
    First, enterprise reorganization work must be carried out cautiously. The business department should jointly consult with private personnel and employees to draft a reorganization plan, which is not subject to time limits, and conduct reorganization in stages and batches. If, during the socialist transformation climax this spring, those factories, workshops, commerce, and transportation industries merged too much, or the units that uniformly calculate profits and losses are too large, appropriate adjustments should be made with preparation. Make the organizational form of the enterprise suitable for the needs of production and operation.
    Second, in order to overcome the artificially divided phenomena in the original supply and marketing relations and collaborative relations in industry and commerce, the Fourth Office and the Fifth Office of the State Council should re-plan the affiliation relationship between certain industrial enterprises, certain handicraft enterprises, and certain commercial enterprises, and formulate an adjustment plan based on the habits of production and operation and the experience of the past few months, so that the organizational form and management relationship of the enterprise are suitable for production and operation and facilitate people's consumption. The Seventh Office of the State Council should study an appropriate solution to the relationship between rural handicraftsmen and agricultural production cooperatives, and the relationship between rural sideline handicrafts and urban handicraft cooperatives, so that it is both beneficial to rural handicraftsmen and agricultural production cooperatives; it can develop the production of rural sideline handicrafts, and it does not harm the production of urban handicraft cooperatives and the lives of members.
    Third, all employees in private enterprises at the time of the implementation of joint state-private ownership should be arranged according to the principles of employing people according to their talents and giving appropriate consideration. If the family members of members of cooperative shops, handicraft production cooperatives, and transportation cooperatives, and the family members of small business owners, were previously auxiliary labor in the enterprise, then they should continue to be absorbed as auxiliary labor in the enterprise or make other appropriate arrangements. The personnel arrangement plans of joint venture enterprises in various places can first be submitted by the Federation of Industry and Commerce, trade associations, and private personnel for opinions, and then reviewed and approved by the relevant business departments. If there are any inappropriate aspects in the personnel arrangements for private personnel in some enterprises in the past, they should be checked and adjusted.

    国务院关于对私营工商业、手工业、私营运输业的社会主义改造中若干问题的指示
    今年一月间，全国各地私营工商业、手工业、私营运输业的社会主义改造运动达到了高潮，资本主义企业实行了全行业的公私合营，个体劳动者的企业实现了各种不同程度的合作化。到目前为止，参加社会主义改造的人数，约占私营工商业、手工业、私营运输业的80％。私营工商业、手工业、私营运输业由资本主义的、个体的生产经营制度转变为公私合营的、合作化的生产经营制度，这是生产关系的一种根本变化，这是我国社会主义改造的伟大胜利。这次社会主义改造的过程，大体是正常的，各地生产和经营都正常地进行，并且在不断地改进。但也有不少地区曾发生过某些混乱现象。在这个改造中，还有许多问题需要解决，现在国务院就目前需要解决的若干问题，作如下的指示：
      一、对于小商贩业务安排问题
    第一、对于没有参加定股定息的公私合营商店和合作商店的小商贩，应当在自愿的原则下，根据当地情况，逐步地、分期地、分行分业地把他们组成分散经营、各负盈亏的合作小组。这种合作小组不但适用于商业的各个行业，同时也适用于饮食业和服务性的行业。在步骤上，应当先从困难行业和困难户着手，逐步扩大。
    第二、国营商业和供销合作社，应当在国营商店、供销合作社商店、合营商店中指定一个店作为每个合作小组的批发店，在业务上领导合作小组。这个批发店对合作小组的任务是：负责供应货源；代向银行借款，解决资金困难；汇集小组成员的应缴税款，代向税局交纳。合作小组的税款今后应当严格实行一年不变的、定期定额的收税办法。批发店的开支，全部由国营商业和供销合作社负担，不由合作小组负担。
    第三、国营商业、供销合作社、合营商店、合作商店之间，在商品的销售上，应当适当分工。有一些商品，应当主要分配给合作小组。有些商品的批零差价，应当扩大。
    第四、国营商业和供销合作社应当负起责任，按照各地小商贩不同的收入情况，区别小商贩中依靠商业为主要收入或者以商业为辅助收入的不同对象，必须负责做到使各地各类小商贩都能获得必需的收入。
    第五、在实行上述办法以后，一个地方和一个行业中，如果仍有困难，可以由国营商业、供销合作社吸收一部分，合并一部分，或者向外地迁移一部分，以便把小商贩完全安排下来。
    二、关于手工业生产合作社、运输
      合作社、合作商店方面的问题
    第一、手工业生产合作社、运输合作社社员的收入不应当比参加合作社以前的劳动收入降低，应当在改善生产经营的基础上，努力做到比合作化以前的劳动收入有所增加。合作商店成员的工资，比国营商店和供销社商店高的不降低，低的应当逐步地适当地提高。为了保证上述各类合作企业成员的劳动收入不降低，每月先开支工资，然后根据剩下的盈余多少，再定公积金的数量。
    第二、上述合作企业的成员，如果因为参加了合作企业，收入减少，生活困难，要求退出合作企业的，应当批准他们退出，但是绝对不准强迫他们退出。退出的时候，他们的股份包括生产资料和现金应当退还。
    第三、手工业生产合作社的产品，当地产当地销的可以自销，但在价格上要服从市场管理；远销的由国营商业或供销合作社选购，或者由生产合作社自销。手工业合作社所用的原料，经过当地政府批准可以自购，但不准抬价抢购；所需外来的原料，国营商业和供销合作社应当积极供应。各地必须把手工业生产合作社的产、供、销计划，纳入地方工业计划之内。
    第四、运输合作社的组织形式，不要强求一律。不要勉强组织木帆船、大车等工具不分红的合作社。已经组成了工具不分红的运输合作社，如果社员要求工具分红，应当改变为工具分红。适应社员的要求，也可以组成统一分配货源、统一运价、统一调配同时又有公共积累的合作小组。
    三、适当解决小业主方面所存在的
                        问题
    第一、原来是家厂不分、家店不分的私营企业的房屋，在实行公私合营以后，应当根据业主提出的意见处理。凡家厂相连、家店相连的房屋，如果是由业主租入的，应当由合营企业续租；如果是业主所有的，则除原有铺面、厂房、栈房应当清产核资，成为合营企业的资财以外，其余房屋都应当归业主所有。如果铺面已归原业主，不再变动。
    第二、小业主中间，缺乏劳动力依靠生产工具为生的车主、船主，当他们的车辆船只参加合作社以后，必须吸收他们到企业内加以适当安排。小业主的汽车调到外地的时候，一般是人随车走，由所在地的交通部门安排；如果本人不能去外地，则由当地交通部门按其过去收入状况，负责安排。
    第三、小业主企业资财的处理办法：小业主的企业参加公私合营企业的，或者改变为国营企业的（如粮食店、肉店等等），他们的资财都按定息办法处理。小业主的企业参加合作商店的，依照全国供销合作社对合作商店所规定的办法，按股金分红。有些合作商店，已经实行定息，可以不变。小业主加入了手工业生产合作社或者运输合作社，如果他们投入的资财超过了应交的定额股金，而手工业生产合作社或者运输合作社又无力偿还他们超过应当交纳股金部分的资财，那末可以把超过股金部分的资财采取作价、存社、付息的办法。
    第四、小业主可以担任手工业生产合作社、运输合作社的理事监事和社内的其他领导职务。他们的工资，应当按照技术标准来评定，不应当被歧视。鼓励有技术的手工业小业主带徒弟，应当给他们适当的酬劳金。
      四、公私合营企业的私股定息问题和
                公私关系问题
    第一、全国公私合营企业的定息户，不分工商、不分大小、不分盈余户亏损户、不分地区、不分行业、不分老合营新合营，统一规定为年息五厘，即年息5％。个别需要提高息率的企业，可以超过五厘。过去早已采取定息办法的公私合营企业，如果它们的息率超过五厘，不降低；如果息率不到五厘，提高到五厘。本年七、八月间，应当发给1956年度的第一、第二两季的私股利息。
    第二、工商业务主管部门应当经常召集合营企业的公股代表和私股代表分别举行会议，有时，也应当召集公私双方代表在一起举行会议，收集意见，进行教育，解决他们在处理公私关系中所遇到的困难。为了使上级业务部门规定的业务方针、政策和办法，都能为公私双方有关人员所熟悉，业务部门应当负责下达这些方针、政策和办法，并且尽可能地把它们的要点，在报纸上公布。
    第三、中央和省市两级的工商业务主管部门的领导人员，应当分别定期邀集当地工商联、同业公会、民建会的负责人员举行座谈会，就公私关系中各个方面的有关问题交换意见。待中央和省市两级座谈会广泛推行并且取得经验以后，再逐渐把这种座谈会推行到县城集镇。
    第四、在业务主管部门的领导下，广泛吸收有经验的国营企业的领导人员、职工、店员和私方人员组成各行各业的业务改进委员会，改进业务工作。
      五、职工和私方人员的工资福利问题
    第一、全行业合营以后的公私合营企业中职工的工资和私方人员的工资，高于当地相当国营企业工资标准的，不降低。低于当地国营企业工资标准的，根据生产经营情况和企业的条件，分期地逐步增加，中央和地方的有关部门，应当在今年八月工资改革会议上提出方案，经过批准后予以实行。国务院已经决定，上述公私合营企业的工资改革方案，不问在那个月份实行，新定计时工资标准高于现行工资的部分，一律从1956年7月1日起补发。
    第二、公私合营企业中的生产安全设备和卫生设备，应当逐步加以改进。
    第三、公私合营企业中的职工，目前尚未实行劳动保险的，应当由所在企业解决他们的疾病医疗费用和病假期内的工资。私方人员由于疾病医疗而引起的困难，应当加以帮助。企业核定资财的时候，本人股金在两千元以下的私方人员，本人疾病治疗和病假期内的工资支付办法，都按照所在企业职工的待遇办理。企业核定资财以后，本人股金虽然超过了两千元，只要确有困难，不论他的股金有多少，也可以参照所在企业职工的待遇办理。现在私方人员的疾病医疗和病假期内的工资支付办法，已经按照职工待遇办理的，不改变。公私合营企业原来设有医务所的，应当像对待职工一样准许私方人员去医治。
    六、企业改组和人事安排问题
    第一、企业改组工作，必须慎重地进行。业务部门应当同私方人员和职工共同协商拟出改组方案，不受时间的限制，分期分批地进行改组。今年春天社会主义改造高潮的时候，如果那些工厂、作坊、商业、运输行业合并得太多了的，或者统一计算盈亏的单位太大了的，应当有准备地加以适当调整。使企业的组织形式，适合于生产经营的需要。
    第二、为了克服工商业中原来供销关系和协作关系方面人为地割裂的现象，国务院第四办公室和第五办公室，应当对某些工业企业、某些手工业企业、某些商业企业间的隶属关系重行规划，根据生产和经营的习惯和几个月来的经验，定出调整方案，使企业的组织形式和管理关系，适合于生产经营，便利于人民的消费。国务院第七办公室应当对农村手工业者同农业生产合作社的关系，农村手工业副业同城镇手工业合作社之间的关系，研究出一种适当的解决方案，使它既有利于农村手工业者，又有利于农业生产合作社；既能发展农村的手工业副业生产，又不妨害城镇手工业合作社的生产和社员生活。
    第三、对私营企业实行公私合营时候的所有在职人员，都应当根据量才录用、适当照顾的原则，加以安排。合作商店、手工业生产合作社、运输合作社成员的家属，小业主的家属，如果她们过去都是企业的辅助劳动，那末，应当继续吸收她们为企业的辅助劳动或者作其他的适当安排。各地合营企业的人事安排方案，可以先由工商联、同业公会和私方人员提出意见，再由有关业务部门审查批准。过去有些企业对私方人员的人事安排，如果有不妥当的地方，应当进行检查，加以调整。
