    A Painful Lesson
    Due to negligence and inadequate defense, the Ansheng Dyke in Anxiang County, Hunan Province, breached on July 4th, flooding over 21,000 mu of farmland and affecting nearly 9,000 people. The New Hunan Daily published an editorial on July 9th entitled "A Painful Lesson" regarding this incident. The editorial stated: The breach of the Ansheng Dyke in Anxiang County is extremely distressing. At the time of the breach, the dyke crest still had 2.5 meters of freeboard, and was more than 6.6 centimeters above the county's flood control guarantee level. Furthermore, it was the third day of the overall retreat of the water from the Songzi, Taiping, and Ouchi outlets where the Yangtze River enters the lake, and the four rivers had not risen either. This dyke should not have breached at all.
    The breach of the Ansheng Dyke is clearly a serious accident caused by negligence and inadequate defense, a matter of responsibility. All lakeside and riverside areas must learn a painful lesson from this incident.
    The editorial pointed out that the flood control preparations in many lakeside areas are currently very poor, with only deployment but a lack of inspection; flood control teams are disorganized, and flood control materials are not fully prepared. Recently, due to drought and lack of rain, many cadres and the masses in the lake area believe that there will not be major floods and that it does not matter; seeing that early rice is about to be harvested, they are also not paying attention to strengthening flood control preparations and arranging flood control forces. If this continues, they will inevitably be caught off guard when floods arrive. In order to ensure that no more dykes breach, all areas must be vigilant at all times and be prepared for any eventuality.

### 一个沉痛的教训

    一个沉痛的教训
    由于麻痹大意，疏于防守，湖南省安生垸在七月四日发生溃决，淹田两万一千余亩，受灾人口将近九千。新湖南报就这一事件，在七月九日发表社论“一个沉痛的教训”。社论说：安乡县安生垸溃决，是令人十分痛心的。这个垸子溃决时，堤顶还吊水二点五公尺，距县境防汛保证水位尚差六公寸以上，又是长江入湖的松滋、太平、藕池各口水势全面转退的第三天，四水也都没有涨水。这个垸子是完全不应该溃的。
    安生垸的溃决，显然是由于麻痹大意、疏忽防守而造成的严重责任事故。所有滨湖临江各地都要从这个事件中吸取沉痛教训。
    社论指出，目前滨湖不少地方的防汛准备很差，只有布置，缺乏检查；防汛队伍涣散，防汛器材准备不齐。最近天旱无雨，湖区不少干部和群众认为洪水不大，没有关系；眼看早稻就要开始收割，也不注意加强防汛准备和安排防汛力量。这样下去，一旦洪水到来，势必陷于被动。为了保证不再溃垸，各地就要时刻警惕，做到有备无患。
