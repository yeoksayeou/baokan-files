    Factory Complacency, Municipal Committee Connivance: Guilin Local Industrial Products are of Poor Quality and High Price
    (Our Newspaper News) Guilin's local industrial and handicraft products, such as towels, soap, toothbrushes, and bone combs, are piling up in warehouses due to their low quality and high cost. More than 7,000 boxes of soap are stockpiled, equivalent to the city's total soap production from January to May. Toothbrushes are almost immediately stockpiled upon arrival. Other products such as tripods, flat-bottomed pans, wine, and umbrellas are also of poor quality and high price. The ex-factory price of Guilin tripods is 365 yuan per hundred, but they have many sand holes, making them unpopular with customers. Tripods produced in southern Hunan, on the other hand, have an ex-factory price of 275 yuan, and even with transportation costs, they are still 87 yuan cheaper than those from Guilin, and the quality is better.
    The main reason for the low product quality and high cost is that the leaders of local industrial and handicraft production units are not strict enough with themselves. For example, the factory director of the joint state-private cotton knitwear factory believes that the factory has a short history and that demands should not be too high, so the low quality of towels is natural. Consumers have many complaints about the tripods and flat-bottomed pans produced by the joint state-private Zhongxin Pot Factory, saying that they have many sand holes and are prone to explosions. However, the factory leaders explained, "There has never been a tripod without sand (holes)." The wine produced in Guilin has a strong sour taste and a lot of sediment, but the director of the state-owned Guilin Winery, which produces the wine, said, "Eating it won't kill you!" This kind of thinking of the leaders of the production units is related to the shortcomings of the commercial departments in processing orders, purchasing, and exclusive sales, and also to the leadership of the Guilin Municipal Committee. For example, according to the contract, every hundred umbrellas should have twelve catties of oil, but the umbrella production cooperative only applies six or seven catties. The Guangzhou Export Office of the Ministry of Foreign Trade refused to purchase more than 17,000 umbrellas and demanded that the cooperative rework them. The cooperative refused. After several rounds of negotiation, the Export Office had to bear half of the processing materials and repair wages in addition to the transportation costs before the cooperative agreed to repair them. The soap produced by the Guilin Joint State-Private Chemical Manufacturing Factory deforms after being stored in the warehouse for a short time. The commercial department refused to accept the goods, and the factory leaders complained to the leadership organs, saying, "If you don't accept the goods, we will have to close the factory!" So the Guilin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China made a decision: the commercial department should continue to accept the goods.
    At present, the situation of stockpiling of certain products of local industry and handicrafts in Guilin is still developing. For example, towels have filled the warehouses of commercial departments and factories, and even the manager's office of the Municipal Knitting and Cotton Products Company. Because the warehouse cannot hold any more soap, even the toilets are full. Due to the large backlog of goods, commercial departments have to pay a lot of interest and insurance fees every month, resulting in great losses. (Wei Yuping)

### 工厂自满，市委迁就  桂林地方工业产品质次价高

    工厂自满，市委迁就
    桂林地方工业产品质次价高
    本报讯　桂林市地方工业、手工业出产的毛巾、肥皂、牙刷、骨篦，因为质量低，成本高，已经堆满了仓库。肥皂已积压七千多箱，等于今年一至五月份全市的肥皂产量，牙刷几乎是进仓一把，积压一把。其它产品如鼎锅、扒锅、葡萄酒、雨伞，也是质次价高。桂林市鼎锅的出厂价格，每百个是365元，砂眼很多，顾客很不欢迎；而湘南产的鼎锅出厂价是275元，加上运费，比桂林市还要便宜87元，质量也好。
    造成产品质量低、成本高的原因，主要是地方工业和手工业生产单位的领导人对自己要求不严格。如公私合营棉针织厂厂长，认为工厂厂龄短，要求不能过高，毛巾质量低是很自然的事。消费者对公私合营中新锅厂的鼎锅、扒锅砂眼多，容易爆炸，意见很多，但工厂的领导人解释说：“自古无砂（眼）不成鼎”。桂林市出产的葡萄酒酸味大，沉淀多，生产这种酒的地方国营桂林酿酒厂厂长却说：“吃了不会死人！”生产单位的领导人员的这种思想，跟商业部门在加工订货、收购包销工作中的缺点有关系，跟桂林市委的领导也有关系。如按合同规定每百把雨伞得上十二斤油，但雨伞生产合作社只上六、七斤。对外贸易部广州出口办事处拒绝收购一万七千多把，要求合作社返工修理。合作社不干。经几度协商，最后出口办事处除损失运费外，还负责出一半加工原料和修理工资，合作社才肯修理。桂林市公私合营化工制造厂出产的肥皂，在仓库里存放不久就变形，商业部门拒绝收货，工厂领导人员就向领导机关诉苦说：“不收货就得关厂！”于是中共桂林市委便作了决定：要商业部门继续收货。
    目前桂林市地方工业、手工业的某些产品的积压情况仍在发展。如毛巾已堆满了商业部门和工厂的仓库，甚至堆满了市针棉织品公司经理室。肥皂因为仓库放不下，连厕所也堆满了。由于商品大量积压，商业部门每月需付出大量利息和保险费，损失很大。　（韦雨平）
