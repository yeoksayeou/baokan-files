Xinhua News Agency, July 27th: Over a thousand people from Chinese and foreign theater circles and other walks of life gathered in Beijing today to commemorate the centenary of the birth of world cultural figure George Bernard Shaw and the fiftieth anniversary of the death of Henrik Ibsen.

Mao Dun, Vice Chairman of the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles and Chairman of the Chinese Writers Association, delivered the opening speech at the commemorative meeting, saying that both Shaw and Ibsen were playwrights who made outstanding contributions to world culture, and their excellent works encourage people to love peace and freedom. People all over the world who love peace have immense affection for their works.

Mao Dun said that the Chinese people are not unfamiliar with the playwrights George Bernard Shaw and Henrik Ibsen. The Chinese people immensely love Shaw's sharply written political commentaries and humorously satirical comedies. The playwright had connections with the Chinese people during his lifetime, and the great Chinese writer and thinker Lu Xun had a precious friendship with Shaw. As early as around the time of the Chinese "May Fourth" Movement, the thoughts and feelings of pursuing freedom and liberation in Ibsen's plays had a great influence on the Chinese New Literature Movement.

Mao Dun pointed out that Shaw was a peace-loving realist playwright who more than once expressed his sympathy for socialist countries, and his life's activities enthusiastically supported the cause of human peace and democracy. In his satirical comedies, he exposed and satirized the faces of warmongers and arms dealers with humorous and incisive strokes, and exposed the imperialist policy of enslaving the people through aggression. In his plays, he repeatedly opposed the colonialists' policy of aggression and showed sympathy for the people striving for freedom and liberation. We commemorate Shaw to expand the peace ranks and strive for lasting peace for the people of all countries in the world. Ibsen cared about the progress of humanity in the world, and his plays were closely linked to the social life of the time. His works have profound thoughts because he constantly pursued truth and observed the society and reality of 19th-century Europe. We commemorate Ibsen because his works encourage mankind to strive for freedom and liberation, criticize petty and vulgar realities, and expose the oppression of patriarchal systems on the happy and beautiful lives of human beings.

Today's commemorative meeting was co-sponsored by the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, the China Federation of Literature and Art Circles, the Chinese Writers Association, and the Chinese Dramatists Association.

The presidium walked onto the stage amidst warm applause. They were Mao Dun, Lennox Robinson, director of the Irish National Theatre, Geda Ringdal, director of the Norwegian National Theatre, Rouben James Minney, British writer and friend of Shaw, Gerhard Knoop, Norwegian stage and radio director and representative of the Norwegian Theatre Association, Chu Tunan, President of the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, Xia Yan and Zheng Zhenduo, members of the Presidium of the National Committee of the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles, Yang Hansheng, Vice President of the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries and Secretary-General of the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles, Tian Han, Chairman of the Chinese Dramatists Association, Mei Lanfang, Vice Chairman, Li Bozhao and Chen Qitong, members of the Presidium of the Council of the Chinese Dramatists Association, Feng Xuefeng, Vice Chairman of the Chinese Writers Association, and Liu Baiyu, First Secretary of the Secretariat.

Tian Han delivered a report at the meeting entitled "Learning from the Great Realist Drama Masters." He introduced the great artistic achievements of Shaw and Ibsen and the historical background in which they lived, and introduced the great spiritual influence they had on the growth and development of Chinese spoken drama.

At the meeting, Lennox Robinson, Rouben James Minney, and Geda Ringdal also spoke successively, introducing the lives of Shaw and Ibsen respectively and analyzing the brilliant characteristics and great influence of their plays. They all expressed their deep gratitude to China for holding a meeting to commemorate these two artistic giants.

After the meeting, a commemorative evening was also held to celebrate the centenary of the birth of world cultural figure George Bernard Shaw, during which the Beijing Film Actors Troupe and the Cadre Training Class of the Central Academy of Drama performed excerpts from the second act of Shaw's famous work "The Apple Cart," and excerpts from the second and third acts of "Mrs. Warren's Profession."

The commemorative evening for the fiftieth anniversary of the death of world cultural figure Henrik Ibsen will be held tomorrow evening, during which the China Youth Art Theatre of Beijing will perform Ibsen's famous work "A Doll's House."
