    "Family Collective Dormitory"
    By Our Correspondent Jin Yukun
    The Shenyang State-Owned Trading United Company has a "family collective dormitory" housing sixteen employee families.
    Upon entering, one is greeted by a narrow, dark corridor. The corridor is crammed with eleven coal stoves. The long, narrow corridor is almost entirely blocked by stoves, wooden boxes, and other miscellaneous items.
    The room closest to the stairs houses three couples, with thin boards serving as partitions. In the room closest to the window, a woman named Zhang Shuqing, cradling her four-month-old child, said: "Since the child was born, it has been constantly ill. Later, it was always smoked by the fumes. Now, the child's health is getting worse and worse."
    The middle room has no partitions. Some of the couples living here have been separated for two or three years. A young couple by the window is worried about having a child. Shen Hongwen's wife is already seven months pregnant, and her due date is approaching day by day. She can't possibly give birth in the collective dormitory! Their neighbor (living in the middle of the common sleeping platform), Hong Houfu, and his wife told me: "We have been applying and registering for housing every year since 1953, but we don't know when it will be resolved." His two children, the older one already ten years old, have not been with their father for a long time, and after every meal, they clamor to go to the warehouse to see their father (who works in the warehouse).
    In 1952, the United Company had only seven hundred employees, but now it has grown to one thousand two hundred. The rate of increase in family members is even greater. Those who were not married in the past have gotten married, those who did not have children now have children, and those whose homes were elsewhere have also moved here. In several adjustments, the single dormitory increased by more than four hundred square meters, while the family dormitory decreased by five hundred square meters. No wonder the housing problem is becoming more and more serious.
    Of course, it is impossible for the company to solve the housing problem immediately. However, if the leadership takes active measures, some problems can at least be partially solved. For example, the company has a four-story dormitory building with complete kitchen, toilet, bathroom, and gas facilities, which can accommodate more than one hundred and thirty families, but it is allocated to single people. The kitchen cannot function as it should, and many employees with families are squeezed into houses with incomplete facilities. They have no choice but to put coal stoves in the corridors, which is very unreasonable.
    If the Shenyang Municipal Property Management Department could reasonably adjust the existing houses, it could also help employees solve part of their housing problems. But they have done very little in this regard. On the floor above this "family collective dormitory," there are four empty rooms. These were originally the dormitory for employees of the Communications Department. When the employees moved with the agency, these four rooms were left empty. There is also an agency office nearby with very few people but occupying a large courtyard. If the property management department came out to adjust, the housing problem would not be so tight.
    Housing is a necessary condition for people's work and life. This problem should be actively and systematically solved along with the development of production, and a passive and procrastinating attitude should never be adopted. It is wrong to only pay attention to increasing production, expanding business, and increasing personnel without simultaneously solving the housing problem for employees.

### “家属集体宿舍”

    “家属集体宿舍”
    本报记者　金雨困
    沈阳市国营贸易联营公司有个“家属集体宿舍”，住着十六户职工家属。
    一走进门，就是一条又窄又黑的走廊。走廊上整整放了十一只煤球炉子，狭长的走廊几乎全被炉子、木箱、和其他杂物堵塞了。
    靠楼梯的一间住着三对夫妇，当中用薄板做了个间壁。靠窗的一家，女的叫张淑清，怀里抱着一个四个月的孩子，她说：孩子生下来一直闹病，后来又老是被烟熏着过日子，现在孩子的身体越来越不好了。
    另一个房间当中没有间壁。住在这里的夫妇，有的已经分居二、三年了。靠窗的一对年青夫妇正在担忧着生孩子的事情。沈鸿文的爱人已经怀孕七个月，产期一天一天临近了，总不能在集体宿舍里生孩子呀！他们的邻居（住在统铺的中部）洪厚甫夫妇告诉我：“为了房子问题，从1953年就年年申请，年年登记，不知哪天能解决”？他的两个孩子，大的已经十岁，长期不和爸爸在一起，一吃完饭就闹着要到仓库去看爸爸（爸爸在仓库工作）。
    1952年，联营公司仅有七百人，现在已经发展到一千二百人。家属的增加比率更大。过去没有结婚的结婚了，没有孩子的有孩子了，家在外地的也迁来了。在几次调整中，独身宿舍增加了四百多平方公尺，家属宿舍却减少了五百平方公尺，难怪房子问题越来越严重了。
    当然，要公司立即解决房子问题也是不可能的。但是，如果领导方面采取积极措施，有些问题至少可以解决一部分。例如公司有一座厨房、厕所、浴室、瓦斯等设备齐全的四层宿舍大楼，可以容纳一百三十多户家属，却分配给独身者居住，厨房就不能发挥应有的作用，许多有家属的职工反而挤在设备不全的房子里，他们只好在走廊里安煤球炉子，这是很不合理的。
    沈阳市房产管理部门如果能合理调整现有房屋，也能帮助职工解决一部分住房。但是他们恰恰在这方面做得很少。就在这个“家属集体宿舍”的楼上，就有四间房子空着，原来这是交通厅的职工宿舍，职工们随着机关迁移，这四间房子就空下了。附近还有一个机关的办事处，人很少，占的院子却很大。如果房产管理部门出来调整一下，房子问题决不会这样紧张。
    居住是人们工作和生活必需的条件。应该随着生产的发展，积极地有计划地解决这个问题，绝不能采取消极拖延的态度。只注意提高生产、扩大业务、增加人员，而不同时给职工解决住宅问题，是错误的。
