Xinhua News Agency, Helsinki, July 13th: Finnish Parliament Speaker Sukselainen, upon returning from a visit to China, told a representative of the Finnish News Agency: "The trip to China was very successful and enriching."

The Speaker said that in China, the Finnish parliamentary delegation mainly discussed the issue of cooperation between parliaments with the Chinese National People's Congress. Regarding this matter, a Chinese parliamentary delegation may visit Finland in a year, at which time it will be further discussed. He said that at his farewell banquet, he had expressed his hope to invite a Chinese parliamentary delegation to visit Finland, and he would issue an invitation later.

Sukselainen said: The delegation members spent a total of two weeks in China, during which they traveled by plane 26 times. The total distance of these 26 trips, calculated as a straight line, would be equal to a quarter of the Earth's circumference.

The most profound impression of visiting China was the phenomenon of rapid and enthusiastic work being carried out everywhere. People are building feverishly. The most enthusiastic scenes were at the Anshan Iron and Steel Works and the huge Changchun Automobile Factory.

However, housing construction has not been neglected. The state pays attention to the construction of all housing. A considerable number of brick-built workers' houses have been built on sites that were previously thatched mud huts.

The rural cooperative farms give the impression that cultivation is very good. A farmer's annual income is currently estimated to be about 400 yuan, but the goal is to increase it to 600 yuan. The houses and the people living in them are neat and clean, and the honesty of the people is a very pleasant thing. If a traveler forgets something or pays too much money, they will immediately return the lost part.

A reporter asked him if the Chinese people understood Finland and what attitude the Chinese people took toward Finland. Sukselainen said: Finland is well known in China, and it is surprising that many of them have been to Finland. Our delegation received an extremely friendly reception, and when Liu Shaoqi, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, explained China's relationship with small countries and its attitude towards them at an ordinary banquet, I truly felt like a member of a large country myself. Sukselainen laughed as he said this.

Speaker Sukselainen concluded: In short, we should do our best to ensure that our Chinese counterparts receive the same hospitality during their return visit as we did during our visit, and that everything is arranged so wonderfully.

    芬兰议会议长谈访华观感
    表示欢迎我国人民代表大会代表团访问芬兰
    新华社13日讯　赫尔辛基消息：芬兰议会议长苏克西莱宁从中国访问回来向芬兰通讯社的代表说：“到中国去的旅行是很成功的、而且是很丰富的。”
    这位议长说，在中国，芬兰议会代表团同中国人民代表大会主要讨论了关于议会间的合作问题。关于这个问题，一年以后中国议会代表团也许到芬兰来，那时将继续加以讨论。他说他在临别宴会上已经表示了请中国议会派代表团访问芬兰的希望，他将在以后发出邀请。
    苏克西莱宁说：在中国逗留的日子一共是两个星期，在这期间，代表团团员一共乘飞机旅行了二十六次，这二十六次旅行如果按直线长度计算的话就足以等于地球的四分之一。
    访问中国最深刻的印象是到处可以看到的迅速、热情地进行工作的现象。人们在狂热地进行建设，特别热烈的景象是在鞍山钢铁工厂和巨大的长春汽车工厂。
    但是住房的建造也未被忽视，国家注意一切住房的建筑，相当数量的用砖头建筑的工人住房已在以前是茅草泥土小屋地方建立起来。
    农村的合作农庄使人感觉耕种很好。一个农民的全年收入估计目前大约有四百元，但是目标是要提高到六百元。住宅和住在里面的人都是整齐干净的，人民的诚实是一个非常令人愉快的事情。如果一个旅行者忘了什么东西或是给钱给得太多了的话，他们就会立刻交还损失的那部分。
    记者问他中国人对芬兰是不是了解，中国人对芬兰采取什么态度。苏克西莱宁说：芬兰在中国是大家都知道的，令人惊奇的是他们有许多人曾经到过芬兰。我们代表团受到了极其友好的接待，并且，当人民代表大会常务委员会委员长刘少奇在一次普通宴会上解释中国同小国家的关系和对它们的态度的时候，我确实感觉到我自己是一个大国的一分子。苏克西莱宁说到这里笑了。
    苏克西莱宁议长最后说：总之，我们应该尽最大的努力来使我们的中国同行们在答访中受到同我们访问时一样的接待，每一件事都安排得如此美妙。
