    It was many years ago. I was only six years old, returning home from kindergarten, preoccupied with my toys and the pleasures of life. On the way home, I noticed something unusual happening. The streets were filled with crowds shouting loudly, and I remember them shouting things like, "Freedom and death for freedom are better than living under colonialism" ... and so on. I didn't understand what they were shouting, nor why they were so angry, but suddenly, I found myself running along with the people who were running. I heard the whistling of bullets, and when I saw many young men, women, and girls falling to the ground, covered in blood and dying, I was terrified. I could hardly breathe… Hours later, I don't know exactly how many hours, I found myself among a group of strangers, in a very cold and dark place, with none of my relatives around. I cried for my mother; someone among the people around me greeted me kindly, trying to make me forget the scene. Finally, I saw some soldiers with faces very different from my compatriots, speaking a different language, who cruelly dragged me away, one of them even kicking me and telling me not to cry, complaining that my crying was disturbing him.

    From that day on, I understood the pain of living under colonialism, and I felt that the blood shed by my brothers and sisters was my own blood. At such a young age, I knew what freedom was, what independence was, and why people shouted "Death for independence is our goal," and why they would rather die than live this kind of life. This day was not the beginning of the struggle for independence. In the years before and after this day, the Egyptian people had already been fighting, they were imprisoned, killed, and exiled from their homeland—exiled to remote islands with the flag of the British Empire flying high.

    The Egyptian people suffered greatly, just as my Chinese friends suffered for their independence, in the struggle for the freedom they longed for. The word "freedom" is not just a word; it occupies such a large place in people's lives. It means… but my friends, you all know what it means because we have shared experiences. Striving for their right to survival and freedom, the Egyptian people opposed not only colonialism but also the power of imperialism, feudalism, and capitalism.

    The people's emotions reached a boiling point, and in the hearts of every Egyptian child, man, and woman, there was a demand for a revolution. That day was July 23, 1952. History will never forget this day. This day is worth writing about in the hearts of all the Egyptian people. This day is the birth of our revolution, please forgive me, my Chinese friends, this day is the rebirth of the Egyptian people. On the twenty-sixth of this month, King Farouk was driven out of his paradise. Yes, he left Egypt, and if you have the opportunity to visit Egypt, don't forget to visit the palace, and then you will agree with me that Farouk did indeed live in paradise.

    But was he loyal to his paradise and the people who fought to the death to allow him to live like a king of a free country? No, my friends, do you know who brought about seventy-four years of colonialism? It was a member of this royal family, Farouk's grandfather. He requested the protection of the British army to deal with the Egyptian people's revolution. But friends, could any Egyptian do this…? Don't be surprised yet; Farouk's grandfather and his family, including Farouk, were not Egyptian; they came from Turkey. They were Turks, so you will understand who Farouk was, what his family was, and why the Egyptian people drove Farouk out of their homeland.

    From this day on, Egypt was governed by true Egyptians, and we began to clash with the colonizers. After Farouk was driven away, they were alone. Farouk supported them to protect himself against the Egyptian people. The colonizers had to face the Egyptian people alone. We had been eagerly looking forward to this day. We, the Egyptian people, had made life in their barracks almost like hell. Every minute they tasted the punishment inflicted by Egyptian patriots. These were difficult days for the colonizers. They faced and awaited death at every moment. Finally, they lost control, realized that they could not live in Egypt, and they succumbed… After seventy-four years of colonization and the struggle for freedom, they left Egypt. They returned Egypt to the Egyptians. Unfortunately, I was not there to see the last British soldier leave my homeland. I was in China, among brothers and sisters, and I will never forget that the friendship of my Chinese friends was the best compensation for me being away from my homeland at this historic moment. All my Chinese friends were so happy, and I could feel their emotions when they congratulated me. My friends, the Chinese people, we will never forget your deep affection, and we are sure that the friendship between China and Egypt will last forever.

    埃及人民的新生

    那是多年以前的事了。当时我才六岁，正从幼儿园回家，净惦念着我的玩具和生活的乐趣。在回家的路上，我注意到发生了一些不平常的事。大街上挤满了高声喊叫的人群，我记得他们喊的是：“自由和为自由而死，比在殖民主义底下活着强”……等等。我不懂他们在喊些什么，也不明白他们为什么这样气愤，但是突然间，我发现自己跟着那些在奔跑的人一块奔跑起来。我听到子弹的呼啸，当我看到许多青年、妇女和女孩子们倒在地上，满身是血而且奄奄一息的时候，我简直害怕得要死。我完全透不过气来了……几小时之后，我不知道倒底是几个小时，我发现自己混在一群陌生人当中，在一个很冷很黑的地方，我的亲人一个也不在跟前。我哭着找妈妈；我周围的人当中有人亲热地招呼我，想让我忘了这个情景。最后，我看到一些面孔跟我的同胞大不一样的士兵，也说着不一样的语言，他们残忍地把我牵走，其中一个还用脚踢我，叫我别哭，嫌我的哭声吵着了他。
    打这一天起，我懂得了在殖民主义底下活着的痛苦，而且我感觉到我的兄弟姊妹所流的鲜血就是我自己的鲜血。这样小的年纪，我就知道了什么是自由，什么是独立，以及人们为什么高呼“为独立而死是我们的目标”，以及他们为何宁死也不要这种生活。这一天并不是争取独立的斗争的开始。在这一天的几年前和几年后，埃及人民已经进行了斗争，他们被监禁、杀害和放逐出他们的祖国——被流放到高高挂着大英帝国旗帜的遥远的海岛上去。
    埃及人民受尽了苦难，正如我的中国朋友为了他们的独立所受的苦难一样，在为渴望着的自由斗争。“自由”这个词，不仅仅是一个词而已，它在人民的生活中占着多大的分量呀。它意味着……可是我的朋友们，你们全都晓得它意味着什么，因为我们有着共同的遭遇。力争他们的生存和自由的权利，埃及人民不仅反对殖民主义，而且也反对帝国主义、封建主义和资本主义的权势。
    人民的情绪达到了顶点，在每个埃及儿童、男子、妇女的心灵里都要求来个革命。是这一天，1952年7月23日。历史将永远忘不了这一天。在全体埃及人民的心坎上这一天是值得大书特书的。这一天是我们革命的诞辰，请原谅，我的中国朋友们，这一天是埃及人民的新生。在这个月的二十六日，法鲁克国王被赶出他的天堂。是的，他离开了埃及，如果你们有机会到埃及作客的话，可别忘了去看一看皇宫，然后你们就会同意我的说法，法鲁克确是住在天堂里。
    但是他是否忠于他的天堂和那些为了让他能够活得像个自由国家的国王而拚死奋斗的人民呢？不是的，我的朋友，你们可知道是谁招来了七十四年的殖民主义吗？他就是这个皇族中的一员，法鲁克的祖父。他请求英国军队的保护来对付埃及人民的革命。但是朋友们，难道可能有那一个埃及人会这样做吗……！先别忙着惊讶；法鲁克的祖父和他一家，连法鲁克在内，都不是埃及人，他们来自土耳其。他们是土耳其人，这样你们就会明白法鲁克是什么人，他的家庭是什么，以及埃及人民为什么要把法鲁克赶出他们的祖国。
    从这天开始，埃及由真正的埃及人来治理，于是我们开始同殖民者交锋。在法鲁克被赶走以后，他们便孤单了。法鲁克支持他们来保护他自己，反对埃及人民。殖民者不得不单独同埃及人民相对了。我们早就迫切地盼望着这一天的来临。我们，埃及人民曾经使得他们的兵营的生活跟地狱差不多。他们每分钟都尝到埃及爱国志士给他们的惩罚。对殖民者来说这是艰难的日子。他们时刻都面临和等待着死亡。最后，他们失去了自制，认识到他们不可能在埃及生活下去，他们屈服了……经过了七十四个年头的殖民地化同争取自由的斗争，他们离开了埃及。他们把埃及还给了埃及人。可惜的是，我没有在那儿亲眼看看最后一个英国士兵离开我的祖国。我当时在中国、在兄弟姊妹中间，我将永远忘记不了，我的中国朋友们的友情对我来说，是我在这个历史时刻远离祖国的最好的补偿。所有我的中国朋友们都是这样的高兴，我可以体会当他们向我道贺的时候的感情。我的朋友们，中国人民，我们将永远不会忘记你们的深情厚意，而且确信中埃两国之间的友谊将万年常青。
