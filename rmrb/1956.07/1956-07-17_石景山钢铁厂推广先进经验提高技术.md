    Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant Promotes Advanced Experiences to Improve Technology

    (Our Dispatch) In order to catch up with and surpass the advanced domestic production levels, the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant has vigorously studied and promoted advanced experiences in production. In the first half of this year, the factory successively sent 342 representatives to 28 brother factories and mines, including Anshan, Taiyuan, and Shijiazhuang, to learn 99 advanced experiences. These advanced experiences have played an important role in over fulfilling the state plan for the first half of this year. For example, the factory has an old coke oven, the furnace body of which often leaked gas and needed to be patched with a specially prepared slurry. In the past, spraying the slurry once would only last three or four days. This year, they learned the experience of Shijiazhuang Coking Plant in preparing slurry and spraying, and spraying this slurry now lasts thirty or forty days.
    In the first half of this year, Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant also summarized and promoted 200 advanced experiences of its own, and adopted 60 advanced Soviet experiences. Due to the study and promotion of advanced experiences, the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, according to incomplete statistics, has already reached advanced domestic levels in four major technical and economic indicators such as blast furnace utilization coefficient and hot blast stove wind temperature.

    石景山钢铁厂推广先进经验提高技术
    本报讯　石景山钢铁厂为了赶上和超过国内先进生产水平，在生产上大力学习和推广先进经验。今年上半年，这个厂先后派了342名代表到鞍山、太原、石家庄等二十八个兄弟厂矿学来九十九项先进经验。这些先进经验对超额完成今年上半年国家计划起了重要作用。比如这个厂有一座老炼焦炉，炉体经常跑气，需要用配制好的一种浆把缝补住。过去喷一回浆，过三、四天就掉了。今年他们学习了石家庄炼焦厂有关喷浆配料的经验，喷上这种浆，三、四十天也掉不了。
    石景山钢铁厂今年上半年还总结和推广了本厂的先进经验二百项，并且采用了六十项苏联先进经验。石景山钢铁厂由于学习并推广了先进经验，目前据不完全统计，已经有高炉利用系数、热风炉风温等四种主要的技术经济指标达到了国内先进水平。　　　（杜介民）
