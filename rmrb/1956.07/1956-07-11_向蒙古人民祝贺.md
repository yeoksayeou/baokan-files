    Congratulations to the Mongolian People
    Thirty-five years ago today, on July 11, 1921, when most of Asia was still under the yoke of colonialism, feudalism, and capitalism, the heroic Mongolian people, with the assistance of the Soviet people, overthrew the dark rule of foreign invaders and domestic feudal lords, established a people's revolutionary government, and embarked on a new path of freedom, democracy, and independence.
    After the victory of the People's Revolution, the Mongolian people, under the leadership of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party, guided by Marxism-Leninism, carried out tremendous social and economic reforms to ensure that the country moved towards socialism. However, because Mongolia's economy and culture were extremely backward before the revolution, and the vast majority of herdsmen were heavily bound by religion and feudalism, the democratic revolution lasted for nearly twenty years. It was not until the late 1930s that the Mongolian people eliminated the feudal class. In 1940, a new constitution was promulgated, declaring the basic completion of the democratic revolution, and the Mongolian people entered a new stage of socialist revolution and socialist construction.
    In the era of people's democracy, the Mongolian people, with the comprehensive brotherly assistance of the Soviet Union, have made great achievements in economic and cultural construction, fundamentally changing the backwardness that had persisted for generations. In the animal husbandry, the main sector of the national economy, the achievements of modern breeding science and technology have been widely adopted, and the number of livestock has increased by more than half. Crop cultivation has also seen significant development. Industry has been established and developed from scratch. Now, the proportion of industrial output value in the total industrial and agricultural output value is approaching half, and this year's industrial output will increase by more than 12% compared to last year. In Mongolia's national economy, socialist components have already taken a leading position. As a result of the profound cultural revolution, Mongolia has almost eliminated illiteracy, all school-age children have been enrolled, and a large number of native intellectuals and scientific and technical experts have grown up. With the development of national construction, the Mongolian people have been freed forever from poverty and are living an increasingly happy life.
    The achievements of the Mongolian people's revolution and construction vividly demonstrate the immortal vitality of Lenin's theory that backward countries can bypass capitalism and transition to socialism with the help of socialist countries. Thirty-five years is very short in the history of human development, but in this short period, the Mongolian people have broken away from the darkness and ignorance of the Middle Ages, realized a revolutionary leap, and moved towards the brilliant socialism. The victory of the Mongolian People's Revolution and the achievements of construction have inspired all righteous people in the world and greatly encouraged the people of backward countries who are fighting for national independence and social progress.
    Striving for lasting world peace and strengthening friendly cooperation between countries is a consistent and deep-seated desire of the Mongolian people. In the Second World War against fascist aggression, and in the post-war struggle to defend peace and strive to ease international tensions, the Mongolian people have made significant contributions. Due to the consistent pursuit of a peaceful foreign policy by the Mongolian People's Republic, its international status continues to improve. Countries accounting for more than half of the world's population, including the Soviet Union, China, and India, have established and are developing friendly diplomatic relations with the Mongolian People's Republic.
    The Chinese people are particularly excited and delighted about the brilliant achievements the Mongolian people have achieved in the past thirty-five years. Mongolia is our close neighbor, and the people of China and Mongolia have a long tradition of friendship. After the founding of the People's Republic of China, this friendship has greatly developed on a new basis. The Sino-Mongolian Economic and Cultural Cooperation Agreement signed in 1952 has brought the comprehensive cooperation between the two countries into a new stage. Over the years, the volume of trade between the two countries has continued to grow, and economic and cultural exchanges have expanded. The two countries have repeatedly sent various delegations to conduct mutual friendly visits, enhancing mutual understanding and close friendship between the two peoples. The opening of the Beijing-Ulan Bator railway in January this year has provided more convenient conditions for friendly cooperation between the two countries. The development of this brotherly friendship and cooperation not only conforms to the interests and aspirations of the two peoples, but also contributes to the cause of world peace and socialism.
    As the Mongolian people jubilantly celebrate the 35th anniversary of the victory of the People's Revolution, we warmly congratulate the brotherly Mongolian people on their great victory over the past thirty-five years, and sincerely hope that they will achieve new and greater achievements in the cause of national construction and defense of peace.

    向蒙古人民祝贺
    三十五年前的今天，1921年7月11日，当亚洲绝大部分土地还处在殖民主义、封建主义和资本主义的奴役之下的时候，英勇的蒙古人民在苏联人民的援助下，推翻了外国侵略者和本国封建主的黑暗统治，成立了人民革命政府，走上了自由、民主和独立的新生活的道路。
    在人民革命胜利之后，蒙古人民在以马克思列宁主义为指南的蒙古人民革命党的领导下，进行了巨大的社会的和经济的改革，保证国家向社会主义前进。但是，由于革命前蒙古的经济和文化极端落后，广大牧民受到宗教和封建主义的重重束缚，因此，民主革命延续了将近二十年。到三十年代末，蒙古人民才消灭了封建阶级。1940年颁布新宪法，宣告民主革命的基本完成，蒙古人民从此转入了社会主义革命和社会主义建设的新阶段。
    在人民民主年代中，蒙古人民在苏联兄弟般的全面援助下，在经济和文化建设上取得了伟大的成就，从根本上改变了世世代代以来的落后面貌。国民经济主要部门的畜牧业，广泛地采用了现代饲养科学技术的成就，牲畜头数增加了一倍半以上。农作物种植业也有了显著的发展。工业从无到有地建立和发展了起来。现在，工业产值在工农业总产值中的比重已将近达到一半，而今年的工业产量又将比去年增加12％以上。在蒙古国民经济中，社会主义成分已经占着领导的地位。由于进行了深刻的文化革命，蒙古几乎已经没有了不识字的人，所有学龄儿童都已入学，本民族的大批知识分子和科学技术专家已经成长起来。随着国家建设的发展，蒙古人民已经永远摆脱了贫穷的处境，过着越来越好的幸福生活。
    蒙古人民革命和建设的成就，生动地证明了列宁关于落后国家在社会主义国家帮助下可以越过资本主义向社会主义过渡这一学说不朽的生命力。三十五年，这在人类发展史上是很短暂的，但是蒙古人民却在这个短短的期间摆脱了中世纪的黑暗和蒙昧，实现了革命的跃进，向着光芒万丈的社会主义迈进。蒙古人民革命的胜利和建设的成就，使全世界正义人类感到振奋，使正在为争取民族独立和社会进步而斗争的落后国家人民得到极大的鼓舞。
    争取世界持久和平和加强各国之间的友好合作，是蒙古人民一向的深切愿望。在反对法西斯侵略的第二次世界大战中，在战后保卫和平和争取缓和国际紧张局势的斗争中，蒙古人民作出了重大的贡献。由于蒙古人民共和国一贯奉行和平的外交政策，它的国际地位还在不断地提高。包括苏联、中国和印度在内，占世界人口一半以上的国家，已经同蒙古人民共和国建立了并且发展着友好的外交关系。
    中国人民对于蒙古人民三十五年来所获得的光辉成就感到特别的兴奋和喜悦。蒙古是我们亲密的邻邦，中蒙两国人民之间有着悠久的传统友谊。在中华人民共和国成立以后，这种友谊在新的基础上大大地向前发展了。1952年签订的中蒙经济和文化合作协定，使两国的全面合作进入了新的阶段。几年以来，两国之间的贸易额不断增长，经济和文化交流日益扩大。两国多次派遣了各种代表团进行相互的友好访问，增进了两国人民的相互了解和亲密友谊。今年一月北京—乌兰巴托铁路的通车，为两国的友好合作提供了更加便利的条件。这种兄弟般的友谊和合作的发展，不仅符合两国人民的利益和愿望，而且有助于世界和平和社会主义的事业。
    当蒙古人民举国狂欢地庆祝人民革命胜利三十五周年的伟大节日的时候，我们热烈地祝贺兄弟般的蒙古人民三十五年来的伟大胜利，并衷心地期望他们在国家建设和保卫和平的事业中获得新的更大的成就。
