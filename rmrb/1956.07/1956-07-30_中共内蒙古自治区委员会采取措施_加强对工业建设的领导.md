Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, July 27th: The newly elected CCP Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Committee is taking effective measures to implement the resolution of the first CCP Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Congress on gradually shifting the focus of leadership to industry.

The CCP Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Committee recently held its first plenary session, deciding that in the second half of this year, it will strengthen leadership and support for the construction of the Baotou industrial base, new railway construction, and exploration work. To adapt to the current construction situation of the Baotou iron and steel industrial base, the meeting decided that the Autonomous Region Committee should establish three departments based on the current Industry Department: Industrial Transportation, Forestry, and Basic Construction. It also suggested that the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region People's Committee establish a Construction Committee to manage comprehensive construction work, coordination of basic construction, and urban construction planning. The meeting also determined that the Baotou, Hohhot, and Jining municipal party committees should focus their leadership on basic construction and industrial production while also paying attention to leading other undertakings. Party committees at the league, district, banner, and county levels should focus on agricultural and animal husbandry production while also paying attention to leading other economic, cultural, educational, and health undertakings.

The meeting decided that in the second half of the year, a thorough struggle against bureaucracy and red tape would be launched within party and government departments above the banner and county levels to improve leadership style, increase the efficiency of government offices, and improve the quality of work.
