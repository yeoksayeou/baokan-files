Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 8th. Over the past six months, workers in more than 40 factories in Shanghai have rushed to produce approximately 4,000 pieces (sets) of mechanical and electrical equipment to support the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant in producing cars ahead of schedule.

The vast majority of this equipment was urgently ordered. It includes various automatic control switches, instruments for automatically adjusting and recording temperatures, test benches, and some specialized machine tools, many of which are being manufactured domestically for the first time. Factories undertaking these orders generally completed them ahead of schedule or on time, and the quality was excellent.

In order to see domestically produced cars driving in Shanghai as soon as possible, many model workers, advanced producers, and the most skilled workers from many factories participated in this work. The Shanghai Machine Tool Electrical Appliance Factory, which already had a heavy production load, recently completed an emergency task for the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant to produce a batch of micro switches in three days. The Xin Cheng Electrical Appliance Factory trial-produced a pneumatic regulating instrument for the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant. Although the technical requirements were very high and the structure was also very complex, they still supplied the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant with the entire contract quantity three months ahead of schedule.

    支援第一汽车厂提前出产汽车
    上海职工赶制出四千件设备
    新华社上海8日电　上海四十多家工厂的职工，在今年的六个多月里，已经为支援第一汽车制造厂提前出产汽车赶制出约四千件（台）机械电器设备。
    这些设备绝大部分都是紧急定货。其中包括有各种自动控制开关、自动调整和纪录温度的仪表、试验台和一些专用的机床，有许多在国内还是第一次制造。承制这些定货的工厂一般都做到了提前和按期完成，质量也很好。
    为了能早日看到国产汽车在上海行驶，许多工厂的劳动模范、先进生产者和技术最好的工人，都参加了这项劳动。生产任务本来已很繁重的上海机床电器厂，不久前用三天时间为第一汽车制造厂突击完成了一批微动开关的紧急任务。新成电器厂为第一汽车制造厂试制的有一种气动调节仪表，虽然技术要求很高，结构也很复杂，但也提前三个多月按合同数量全部供给了第一汽车制造厂。
