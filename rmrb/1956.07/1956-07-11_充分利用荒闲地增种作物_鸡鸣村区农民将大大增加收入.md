    Make Full Use of Barren and Idle Land to Increase Crop Planting
    Farmers in Jiming Village Area Will Greatly Increase Income
    (Our Newspaper) This district has achieved complete socialist cooperation and the Jiming Village area of Zunhua County, Hebei Province, launched a "No Idle Land" campaign, greatly increasing the income of its members. Jiming Village area is a mountainous area with about 27,200 mu of scattered barren land, corners, and beaches. In order to make full use of these vacant lands and increase the income of the members, the Jiming Village Area Committee of the Communist Party of China led the farmers to carry out the "No Idle Land" campaign this spring. As of mid-June, more than 6,700 people from cooperatives throughout the area have participated in this campaign, reclaiming 2,125 mu of mountainous land and 783 mu of corners and edges. On these newly reclaimed larger plots of land, 2,559 mu of grain crops and 129 mu of cash crops have been planted. On the idle land such as field corners, river banks, and ditch banks, 350,000 pumpkin seedlings and 43,128 castor bean plants have been planted. In addition, many eggplants, green peppers, and other vegetables have been planted on vacant land near the villages.
    The full utilization of scattered land has greatly increased the planted area of crops, and the income of cooperatives throughout the area will increase significantly. The Jianming Agricultural, Forestry, and Animal Husbandry Production Cooperative, led by Wang Guofan, which is famous throughout the country for its thriftiness, has increased the planting area of grains and potatoes by about 800 mu due to the full utilization of barren land and scattered vacant land. In addition, a large number of melons and vegetables have been cultivated. It is estimated that the income from crops, melons, and vegetables on scattered barren land alone is worth more than 30,000 yuan, and the average income of each laborer in the cooperative can increase by 28.8 yuan.

    充分利用荒闲地增种作物
    鸡鸣村区农民将大大增加收入
    本报讯　实现了完全社会主义合作化的河北省遵化县鸡鸣村区开展“无闲地”运动，大大增加了社员收入。鸡鸣村区是个山区，零星荒闲的地头、地角、沙滩约有27，200多亩。为充分利用这些空闲地，增加社员收入，中共鸡鸣村区委今春领导农民开展“无闲地”运动。截至六月中旬止，全区合作社投入这一运动的人数有6，700多人，共开荒山2，125亩，地头地角783亩，并在这些已开垦的较大片的土地上，种植了粮食作物2，559亩，经济作物129亩，地头、地角、河边沟岸等废地，种了倭瓜35万窝，蓖麻43，128棵，在离村近的空闲地上，还栽了很多茄子、青椒等蔬菜。
    零星土地的充分利用，大量增加了作物种植面积，全区各个合作社的收入将有显著的增加。以勤俭办社闻名全国的，由王国藩所领导的建明农林牧生产合作社，由于充分利用荒地和零星空闲地，增加了粮食和薯类的种植面积约八百亩。此外，还大量栽培了瓜菜。据估计，仅仅利用零星荒闲土地上的农作物和瓜菜的收入，就约值三万多元，全社平均每个劳动力可增加收入28.8元。
