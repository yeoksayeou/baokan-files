The poet's talent is love, love for his motherland, love for his people.
      ——Wen Yiduo

Facing the "Red Candle," I once again hear Mr. Wen Yiduo's voice, as soft as a vibrating zither; I once again intently gaze at his warm and illuminating eyes; my thoughts, along the path of memory, instantly fly back to thirteen years ago.

On an autumn afternoon in 1943, the sky over Kunming seemed exceptionally blue and high, and the warm sun shone on the long, dry grass, emitting a fragrant scent. Inside the new campus of the Southwest Associated University, there was silence; only from a classroom near the east wall could one hear intermittent bursts of happy laughter.

The classroom was packed with people. Professor Wen Yiduo was not standing on the podium, but sitting in the middle of the classroom, squeezed among the students. Many unwavering gazes surrounded him.

It was a lecture on Tang poetry. But this was nothing like a teacher giving a lesson to students! (I had never seen a class taught like this before.) Wen Yiduo wore silver-rimmed glasses, dressed in a wide, old, faded gray gown, comfortably propped his right elbow on the writing board on the right side of his chair, gently supporting his chin, and held up a thread-bound copy of Tang poetry. He recited in a low, slow voice, as if he wanted to melt all the poem's thoughts, rhymes, and the author's emotions into his voice; he was savoring it, appreciating it, and at the same time re-expressing it. This voice was so beautiful, so pleasant to listen to, I had never heard such a pleasant voice.

He recited Chen Zi'ang's "Ascending Youzhou Terrace": "Before me, I see not the ancients, after me, I see not those who are to come; thinking of the immensity of heaven and earth, alone, I shed tears of sorrow." He liked Chen Zi'ang, saying his poems were simple and unadorned, unlike the decadent sounds of the palace-style poetry since the Six Dynasties; Chen Zi'ang was incompatible with the people of his time, and the feelings of worry, anger, depression that he expressed a thousand years ago seemed to have also seeped into the heart of the poet Wen Yiduo.

He cursed the tastes of the scholar-official class (including those of the past and the present, including others and also what he himself had once possessed); he cursed the Tang dynasty for using poetry to select officials, thereby ruining poetry. But somehow the conversation drifted to the "strong laborers" along the highway outside Kunming's Great Western Gate. Mr. Wen's voice became even lower, his eyes looking out the window, as he said, word by word: "I also have a heart. Seeing those strong laborers along the highway, treated worse than livestock, collapsing as I watched, it was a punishment to me—like a whip lashing my back!"

The reality of life filled with blood and tears, and the people's resistance struggles, educated Wen Yiduo. In those years, Chinese intellectuals once again underwent a dramatic division: people like Hu Shih were elevated to the position of ambassador to the United States, serving his two masters with great satisfaction; while Wen Yiduo embarked on the difficult path of Mr. Lu Xun. Once, at his home, he said: "Lu Xun was right, I was wrong!" Mr. Wen said this more than once. He did not want to use these words to demonstrate that he was willing to correct his mistakes. He knew that in front of his students, in front of the younger generation he trusted, saying such words would sow certain seeds and point out a certain direction.

At night, in a small building, a group of young people who loved poetry gathered together excitedly. Each brought their recently written poems and exchanged them.

Mr. Wen also came. He was a reader of everyone's poems, and also a temporary critic. The house was too small, there were too many people, and there were no stools, so they stacked round cushions made of straw against the wall and sat in a row; the screen railing was also full of people.

Mr. Wen was originally respectfully seated on the bed, but halfway through he squeezed into the row sitting on the straw cushions. He recited some poems and also read one of mine. As he read, I felt ashamed, but also deliriously happy. I only cared about listening to how he recited it, so I didn't hear what he said about my poem.

The discussion about poetry was very intense. Mr. Wen smiled, listened, and did not participate much in the debate. Suddenly, he asked a question: "What do you think I came here to do?" Everyone was caught off guard by this question, and before they could answer, he paused and said: "You may think that I came here to teach you, to lead you? It would be wrong to think that way. I came here to warm myself! In fact, it's not me leading you, it's you pushing me forward! The young people of today are doing many things that they shouldn't be doing, but they are doing them, and doing them quite well. They are carrying the burdens of the middle-aged on their shoulders. This makes people happy to see, but also makes people feel sad. Why not let them study hard in school? This is exactly the age when they should be studying. This shows that many middle-aged people have abandoned their responsibilities to life, and if young people don't take up this burden, things will be even more neglected!..."

Most of the young people did not fail Mr. Wen's trust—they had undergone a long period of tempering through national disasters that began as far back as the "September 18th Incident," just like wolf cubs raised in the forest, their vision, hearing, biting strength, and even the muscles of their limbs and the nerves in their bodies had to be slightly more sensitive and powerful than the previous generation of young people. It can also be said that the reactionary rule was about to end, so the nascent forces were able to universally expand and grow stronger. In fact, this was indeed the case: young people, especially the advanced elements among them who had accepted Marxism, were like the surging tide of the Qiantang River, pushing Wen Yiduo forward; and when Wen Yiduo saw the light of the proletarian party and came into contact with the revolutionary theory of Marxism, he stepped forward and consciously took on the combat tasks of leading the youth and organizing the masses, and ultimately died for his cause.

I will never forget Mr. Wen's voice. I still want to write a poem for Mr. Wen, to find a word that can describe Mr. Wen's voice, but I can't find it; because it is so rich and profound. Sometimes—for example, when he recites Tang poetry, or when he speaks normally—it is like the vibration and harmony of the low strings of a cello, like the boatmen's songs of the Volga Boatmen sung by Chaliapin, coming from far away; sometimes, it is like the roar of a lion—when he faces thousands of people, denouncing the fascist secret service rule, or encouraging the marching demonstration teams to set off, or when he recites Tian Jian's "She Also Wants to Kill," the thick hair on his head trembles, like the mane of a ferocious lion; his voice, made even grander by anger, and the righteousness and irresistible truth conveyed by this voice, make your blood boil, your fists clench, and your throat feel a thirst for action.

Sometimes when I pass by Tiananmen Square, I can't help but think: Mr. Wen should have lived to this day, standing in front of Tiananmen Square, watching the marching ranks of the people he loved cheer and advance; Mr. Wen's voice should have resonated in Tiananmen Square, resonated on the world's platform for defending peace, so that the whole world could hear it. His voice would make the new generation of Chinese people love their motherland and their people even more, and encourage the oppressed around the world to fight for freedom; to imperialism and their lackeys, this voice would be a terrifying thunderbolt—accurately striking their heads.

    教我学步的人
    ——闻一多先生逝世十周年祭
    闻山
    诗人的天赋是爱，爱他的祖国，爱他的人民。
      ——闻一多
    面对“红烛”，我耳边重又响起闻一多先生低若鸣琴的声音；我又凝神注视着他那温暖照人的目光；我的思想，沿着记忆的道路，霎忽飞回到十三年前。
    1943年秋天的一个下午，昆明的天空显得又蓝又高，和暖的太阳晒着长长的干草，散发着香味。西南联大新校舍内，一片寂静；只有靠东墙边一个课室里，断续地传出一阵阵高兴的笑声。
    课室里挤满了人。闻一多教授不站在讲台上，却坐在课室当中，挤在学生里面。许多一瞬不移的目光，包围着他。
    是讲唐诗。但这那里像先生给学生上课！（我过去从来就没看见过这样子上课的）闻一多戴着银边眼镜，穿着宽大的旧得发灰的长袍，舒服地用右手支在椅子右边的写字板上，轻托着腮，一只手举起线装的唐诗。他低声缓慢地念着，像要把诗的全部思想、音韵、作者的感情，都融化在他的声音里似地；他在体味着，欣赏着，同时也在重新表现着。这声音，是那么的美，那么好听，我从来没听过这么好听的声音。
    他念着陈子昂的“登幽州台歌”：“前不见古人，后不见来者；念天地之悠悠，独怆然而涕下。”他喜欢陈子昂，说他的诗古朴，不同于六朝以来宫体诗的靡靡之音；陈子昂与时人不合，他千年前抒发的忧愤抑郁之情，似乎也潜入了诗人闻一多的心底。
    他骂士大夫阶级（包括过去的和当代的，包括别人也包括他自己身上曾经有过的）的趣味；骂唐代以诗取士糟蹋了诗。但不知道怎么竟谈到了昆明大西门公路两旁的“壮丁”。闻先生的声音更低沉了，眼睛望向窗外，一字一字地说：“我也有一颗心。看到公路两旁那些壮丁，牲畜不如，看着看着就倒下了，这对我是一种刑罚——就像鞭子抽在我的背上！”
    血泪交流的现实生活和人民的反抗斗争，教育了闻一多。在那样的岁月里，中国的知识分子再一次剧烈地分化：如胡适，被宠升为驻美国大使，正得意万分地侍奉着两代主人；而闻一多，却踏上了鲁迅先生的艰难的道路。有一次在他家里，他说：“是鲁迅对，我错了！”闻先生不只一次这样说。他并不想用这样的话来说明自己勇于改过。他知道，在他的学生面前，在他所信赖的年青一代面前，说这种话，会播下甚么样的种子，指出甚么方向。
    夜晚，在一座小楼上，一群喜爱诗的年青人热哄哄地聚在一起。各人带来自己最近写的诗，交换看着。
    闻先生也来了。他是大家的诗的读者，也是临时的批评家。房子太小，人多，又没有凳子，于是拿稻草打成的园垫子叠起来，靠着墙坐了一排；屏风栏上也坐满了人。
    闻先生原先被尊敬地安置在床上坐着，但半中间他却挤到了坐草垫子那一排里去。他朗诵了一些诗，也读了我的一首。他读时，我觉着害羞，但又感到幸福的发慌。我只顾听他怎样念，以至他如何说我的诗，竟没有听进耳朵里去。
    谈诗谈得很激烈。闻先生笑着，听着，不大参加论争。突然地，他问了一句：“你们以为我到你们中间是干甚么来的？”大家没提防有此一问，还来不及回答，他顿了顿，说：“你们也许以为我是来教你们，来领着你们走的吧？那样想就错了。我是到你们中间来取暖的！其实，哪里是我领着你们，那是你们推着我走！今天的年青人做了许多不应该由他们来做的事，但是他们做了，而且做得很不坏。他们肩上挑着中年人的担子。这教人看了高兴，也使人想着悲哀。干嘛不让他们好好在学校里念书呢？这正是应该念书的年龄。这说明了，有许多中年人放弃了自己对生活的责任，如果年青人不挑起这担子来，事情就更没人过问了！……”
    青年们大多没有辜负闻先生的信赖——他们经过了远自“九一八”便开始了的民族灾难的长久磨练，就像在森林中长大的狼子，他们的视觉、听觉、牙的咬劲，以至于四肢的筋肉、体内的神经，都不能不比过去那一代的青年稍为灵敏，有力。也可以说是：反动统治的时刻已行将结束，所以新生的势力就得以普遍地伸张壮大。事实上也是这样：青年们、尤其是他们中间接受了马克思主义的先进分子，就像钱塘江汹涌的浪潮，推拥着闻一多前进；而闻一多，当他看见了无产阶级的党的光芒，接触了马克思主义的革命理论，他也就挺身而出，自觉地担负起了领导青年、组织群众的战斗任务，并且终以身殉。
    我永远忘不了闻先生的声音。我还想为闻先生写一首诗，想寻找一个能够形容闻先生的声音的字眼，但是找不到；因为它是那么的丰富和深沉。有时候，——例如他念唐诗，或者平时讲话，它就像大提琴低音弦的颤动与和鸣，像夏里亚宾唱“伏尔加船夫曲”时纤夫们自远而近的歌声；有时候，像雄狮的怒吼——当他面向万千群众，痛斥法西斯特务统治，或鼓舞游行示威队伍出发，或者，在他朗诵田间的“她也要杀人”的时候，他头上厚密的长发抖动着，有如猛狮的髦毛；他那由于愤怒而更加宏大的声音，以及这个声音所传达的正气与无可抗拒的真理，使你血液为之沸腾，拳头握紧，喉中感到需要行动的干渴。
    有时候经过天安门，我就禁不住想：闻先生应该活到今天，在天安门前，看着他所热爱的人民欢呼挺进的行列；闻先生的声音，应该响在天安门广场上，响在全世界保卫和平的讲坛上，让全世界都听见。他的声音，将会使新中国的年青一代更热爱祖国，热爱人民，鼓舞全世界被压迫者为自由而斗争；对帝国主义和他们的奴才，这声音便是可怕的雷击——准确地轰击他们的头顶。
