    Fluorescent lamps produced by the state-owned Nanjing Bulb Factory have been sold abroad. To date, the factory has sold more than 43,000 fluorescent lamps to Burma.
    Fluorescent lamps are a novel lighting device. Their lifespan, luminous efficiency, and power consumption are all better than ordinary light bulbs. For more than a decade, the fluorescent lamps used in our country were all imported from foreign countries. In 1952, this factory successfully trial-produced fluorescent lamps and gradually improved their quality. The fluorescent lamps produced have a long lifespan, uniform light emission, and quick ignition. Since exports began at the end of last year, they have been very popular in the international market.

    荧光灯运销国外
    国营南京灯泡厂出产的荧光灯已经运销国外。到现在，这个厂销往缅甸的荧光灯已有四万三千多支。
    荧光灯是一种新颖的照明设备。使用寿命、发光效率和电力消耗都比普通灯泡要好。十多年来，我国使用的荧光灯，都是外国进口的。1952年这个厂试制成功了荧光灯，并且逐步提高质量，做出来的荧光灯使用寿命较长，发光均匀，跳火迅速。自从去年年底出口以来，在国际市场上很受欢迎。
