    Talking About Prose
    Han Fu
    Some say China is a country of poetry. This is certainly true, but aren't we also a country of prose? Without going back to ancient times, from Sima Qian to Liang Qichao, which dynasty didn't have many excellent prose writers? During the "May Fourth" literary revolution, the revivalists boasted that their "descriptive and emotional" writing was superior to ancient prose; but the emergence of beautiful vernacular prose gave them a great demonstration. Lu Xun is a representative figure among prose writers.
    Just taking a few examples from Lu Xun's works: the "Preface to A Call to Arms" tells how he went through a long period of loneliness and finally joined the battle; "My Old Home" (literal: "Village Opera") is also a beautiful piece of prose, which makes people recall their childhood after reading it; "On the Fall of the Leifeng Pagoda" is full of love and hate; "On Photography," "Talking About Beards," "Spring Evening Chat," etc., are graceful and humorous, freely wielding criticism, attacking the ancient feudal fortress, occasionally revealing the glint of a dagger; in "Wild Grass" and "Dawn Blossoms Plucked at Dusk," there is nothing that is not superior prose; his late work "In Memory of Forgetting" has truly entered the realm of perfection, and decades later, reading it still stirs the soul.
    Today, there is still no lack of prose writers, and some beautiful prose occasionally appears in newspapers and periodicals. But regrettably, there are not many people writing, and there are fewer good works. The literary and art circles' lack of promotion of prose in recent years is probably an important reason for this phenomenon.
    We need prose. We are willing to see the dynamic figures of laborers at any time, hear the wonderful songs of pioneers, and also hope to see the magnificence of high mountains and great rivers, and smell the fragrance of rice flowers and grass leaves. If writers depict these, in the rhythmic and varied writing, sometimes revealing formidable and lovely sharpness, it will surely make us feel excited in our hard work and get encouragement in difficulties!
    But today, there is still so little of such prose! A message to the writers of our time: great works naturally need to be written, but being able to mold what you feel at any time into odds and ends is equally valuable training for your pen, and equally unforgettable grace for readers!

    话说散文
    汗夫
    有人说中国是一个诗的国家。这诚然是不错的，但是我们何尝不是一个散文的国家？不必上溯远古，从司马迁到梁启超，哪个朝代没有好些优秀的散文家？“五四”文学革命，复古派自诩“状物写情”的话比不得古文；但白话的优美的散文一出现，就给了他们一个大示威。鲁迅就是散文作家中的代表人物。
    就鲁迅的作品举几个例子说：“呐喊自序”是说他自己如何经过漫长的孤寂而最后终于参加了战斗的；“社戏”也是一篇优美的散文，读了使人顿忆儿时；“论雷峰塔的倒掉”爱憎分明；“论照相之类”“说胡须”“春末闲谈”等篇，雍容谈笑，纵意挥斥，袭击古老封建的堡垒，时露匕首的闪光；在“野草”“朝华夕拾”中，无一不是散文的上乘；他的晚年之作“为了忘却的纪念”真是已入化境，隔了几十年，读起来还是那么激动人的灵魂。
    在今天，散文作家仍然不乏其人，报刊上也偶或出现一些优美的散文。但遗憾的是，写的人不多，好的作品也少了。文艺界近年对于散文缺少提倡，恐怕是这种现象的一个重要原因。
    我们需要散文。我们愿意随时看到劳动者的跃动的身影，听到开拓者的奇妙的歌声，也希望看到高山大川的壮丽，闻到稻花草叶的芳香。如果作家们把这些描绘出来，在低吟高唱、疾徐有致的行文中，时见可畏、可爱的锋芒，一定会使我们在辛劳中感到兴奋，困难中得到激励！
    但今天，这样的散文还这样的少！寄语我们时代的作家：大作品自然要写，但能够把你随时感受到的，塑成零金碎玉，对自己的笔是同样可贵的锻炼，对读者是同样难忘的恩惠！
