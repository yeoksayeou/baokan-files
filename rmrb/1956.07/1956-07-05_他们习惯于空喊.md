	“They are used to empty slogans”
	In March of this year, the Yongcheng County Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Henan Province, based on the county Party committee's instructions to carry out labor competitions in enterprise departments, established a competition committee. In addition to mobilizing all employees, the committee also formulated competition evaluation criteria and inspection systems for units and individuals, and the "Competition Corner" bulletin board was also posted.
	However, from the beginning to the present, this competition movement has not yet established competition conditions, and the "Competition Corner" column is still posted on the wall, only somewhat old after being exposed to the sun and wind. (Chang Qing)

    “他们习惯于空喊”
    今年三月，河南永城县供销社根据县委开展企业部门劳动竞赛的指示，成立了竞赛委员会。委员会除了向全体职工进行动员外，还制定了单位和个人的竞赛评比条件和检查制度，“竞赛园地”的墙报栏也贴出来了。
    但是这项竞赛运动从始至今，还没有订出竞赛条件，“竞赛园地”栏仍旧贴在墙上，只是经过日晒风吹有些陈旧罢了。　（长庆）
