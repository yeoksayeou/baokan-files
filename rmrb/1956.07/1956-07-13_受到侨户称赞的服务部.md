Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, July 11th: The staff of the Overseas Chinese Service Department of the Bank of China's Guangzhou Branch provide thoughtful service to overseas Chinese households. They often deliver interest payments to the homes of overseas Chinese, earning praise from them. According to the branch's recent statistics, since the autumn of 1954, more than 400 overseas Chinese depositors have benefited from the convenience of remittances and interest payments delivered personally to their homes by the Overseas Chinese Service Department. These depositors are generally overseas Chinese dependents who live far away, are busy with household chores, or are elderly. Most of the remittances are entrusted by overseas Chinese to remit interest to their families monthly for living expenses or to support their children's education.

The Overseas Chinese Service Department of the Bank of China also accepts special entrustments, such as sending pocket money monthly to students studying in China on behalf of overseas Chinese, inquiring about their health, and regularly writing letters to inform their relatives overseas about the students' situation.

    受到侨户称赞的服务部
    新华社广州11日电　中国银行广州分行华侨服务部的工作人员为侨户服务周到，他们经常给侨户送利息上门，受到侨户的称赞。据分行最近统计：从1954年秋季开始到现在，有四百多个华侨存户得到了华侨服务部转汇和派专人送利息上门的便利。他们中一般是住地远、家务忙或年纪老的侨眷。转汇大部分是受海外华侨的委托，按月代他们汇利息给他们的家人作生活费或供子弟上学。
    中国银行华侨服务部还接受特种委托，如代国外华侨按月给在国内学习的学生送零用钱和关心他们的健康情况，并且经常把学生的情况写信告诉他们在海外的亲人。
