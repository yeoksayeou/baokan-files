Shaanxi's 4.71 Million Mu of Cotton Fields Budding and Blooming

(Our dispatch from Shaanxi, July 6th) This year, the 4.71 million mu of cotton in Shaanxi Province are growing vigorously. At present, the vast majority of the cotton has budded, and some has begun to bloom. In the Jinghui, Luohui, Weihui, Fenghui, and Heihui irrigation areas and the 1.4 million mu of irrigated cotton fields in Chang'an, Xianyang, and other counties, the lush green cotton has reached 1.5 chi in height, with an average of thirteen or fourteen flower buds per plant. The cotton in general dryland areas also has about ten flower buds, which is better than the same period last year.

At the beginning of this year, the Shaanxi Provincial Department of Agriculture issued a call to strive for a large-scale bumper harvest of cotton, planning to achieve an average yield of over 400 jin of ginned cotton per mu in more than 500,000 mu of high-yield cotton fields in more than ten counties, including Dali, Jingyang, Chang'an, and Xianyang.

In order to achieve a large-scale bumper harvest of cotton, the Provincial Department of Agriculture trained more than 3,800 cotton planting experts before the cotton sowing. After returning, these cotton planting experts taught the advanced cultivation techniques they had learned to the farmers. Therefore, cotton production in Shaanxi Province is generally good this year. (Li Qian)

    陕西471万亩棉田现蕾开花
    本报陕西6日电　今年陕西省471万亩棉花生长茁壮，目前绝大部分棉花已现蕾，部分开始开花。在泾惠、洛惠、渭惠、沣惠、黑惠等灌溉区和长安、咸阳等县的140万亩水浇棉田，绿油油的棉花已高达一尺五寸，平均每棵生长十三、四个花蕾，一般旱地棉花也长起了十个左右花蕾，比去年同期长得好。
    今年年初，陕西省农业厅就提出争取棉花大面积丰产的号召，计划在大荔、泾阳、长安、咸阳等十多个县的50多万亩丰产棉田中，平均亩产皮棉400斤以上。
    为了使棉花大面积丰产，在棉花播种以前，省农业厅训练了3，800多名植棉能手。这些植棉能手回去后，又把他们学习到的先进耕作技术教给农民。因此，今年陕西省棉花生产普遍良好。　　　（李茜）
