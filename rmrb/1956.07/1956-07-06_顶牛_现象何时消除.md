When Will the "Head-Butting" Phenomenon Disappear?
Huang Haiping

Jiangsu Province is a cattle-deficient region, and every year it has to purchase a batch of oxen from outside the province. Last year, it purchased more than 10,000 head, and since the spring of this year, it has purchased more than 7,000 head. From nearby Zhejiang, Anhui, and Shandong to as far as Jiangxi, Henan, and Fujian, each purchase of cattle requires "trekking thousands of miles," taking months for a round trip, and incurring huge transportation costs. The phenomenon of competing to purchase oxen also often occurs between counties within the province. This spring, farmers in the Suzhou area went to cattle-deficient areas such as Nantong to buy at high prices, causing dissatisfaction among local farmers.

In such a cattle-deficient region, the "head-butting" phenomenon of rejecting young calves is now widespread. According to statistics from mid-May, there were more than 15,000 unsold young calves in the province. These young calves are all produced within the province. The producing area (around Xuzhou) has too many young calves and must export them. In the past, individual farmers had the habit of raising young calves as a sideline; now that they have joined cooperatives, they no longer raise cattle. The cooperatives, however, only want large cattle and not small calves. Therefore, despite the widespread calls for cattle, no one is interested in young calves. For example, Chongming County originally wanted to buy 5,000 head of cattle, but later, when they couldn't find large cattle to buy, they resolutely refused young calves. As a result of this "head-butting," the already purchased young calves are kept in the purchasing units for a long time, increasing management costs and resulting in continuous deaths. Farmers in the producing areas are even more unwilling to breed oxen. In Donghai County, an unequal exchange of a chicken for a young calf has occurred. In Datun District of Pei County, some farmers drive young calves to the lakeside to let them run wild, "exposed to the sun and wind, and not brought in at night." In the Huang Lijie area of Feng County, some farmers simply don't give the young calves fodder, saying, "If they can't be sold, they are worthless, better to starve them to death and eat the meat!"

Why do cattle-deficient areas only want large cattle and not young calves? It is said that the reason is: "Raising young calves, losing labor, and wasting fodder is not cost-effective." Is it really not cost-effective? These young calves are generally about five or six months old, worth about twenty yuan when transported from the producing area to the selling area; after two years of raising them into large cattle, they are worth at least one hundred yuan according to current prices. In two years, they can accumulate 4,000 jin of fertilizer worth thirty yuan; the fodder cost for two years (calculated at half the time eating dry grass) is about fifty yuan. Thus, raising a young calf can increase income by about sixty yuan. As for the feeding method, generally large and small cattle are together, and raising an additional young calf does not actually require much more labor. As long as more work is done, explaining the reasons to the agricultural cooperatives, and calculating the detailed accounts, they will be willing to raise young calves. However, the leading organs of many special districts and counties have not seriously solved this problem, so this "head-butting" phenomenon has been going on for several months without being eliminated. If this continues, not only will there be no small calves, but there will also be no large cattle! What will happen then? The leading organs at all levels in Jiangsu Province should consider the long-term interests and quickly solve the "head-butting" problem.

    “顶牛”现象何时消除
    黄海平
    江苏省是缺牛地区，年年都要向省外采购一批耕牛，去年采购了一万多头，今年春季以来采购了七千多头。近至浙江、安徽、山东，远至江西、河南、福建，每购一批牛，都要“跋涉千里”，往返数月，而且运费开支很大。省内县和县之间也常常发生争购耕牛的现象，今年春季苏州一带的农民就曾到南通等缺牛地区用高价购买，引起了当地农民的不满。
    在这样缺牛的地区，目前却普遍发生了不要小牛的“顶牛”现象。据五月中旬的统计，全省有卖不出去的小牛一万五千多头。这些小牛都是省内出产的。产区（徐州一带）的小牛太多，非向外输出不可。过去个体农民有养小牛作副业的习惯；现在他们都入社了，不养牛了。而合作社呢，却只要大牛不要小牛。于是尽管缺牛呼声到处可闻，小牛却无人问津。例如崇明县本来要买五千头牛，后来大牛没处买，他们又坚决不要小牛。“顶牛”的结果，不仅使已经收购来的小牛长期养在收购单位，增加了管理费用，不断死亡。产区农民更普遍不愿繁殖耕牛，东海县竟发生一只鸡换一头小牛的不等价交换，沛县大屯区有些农民把小牛赶到湖边放野牛，“日晒风吹夜不收”。丰县黄李集一带有些农民干脆不给小牛草料，说：“卖不掉，不值钱，不如饿死吃肉！”
    为什么缺牛地区只要大牛不要小牛呢？据说理由是：“养小牛，赔人工，贴草料，不合算。”是不是真的不合算呢？这些小牛一般都在五六个月左右，从产区运到销区约值二十元；二年后养成大牛，按现在价格计算最低值一百元，二年可积肥四千斤值三十元；二年的草料费（按一半时间吃干草计算）约值五十元。这样算来，养一头小牛约可增加收入六十元。至于饲养方法，一般都是大牛小牛在一起，多养一条小牛实际上是不要多花多少人工的。只要多做一些工作，向农业社讲清道理，算算细账，他们是会愿意养小牛的。但是许多专区、县的领导机关没认真地解决这个问题，所以这种“顶牛”现象已经顶了几个月还没有消除。长此下去，不仅小牛没有，大牛也将要没有了！那时候怎么办呢？江苏省各级领导机关应该为长远利益设想，赶快解决“顶牛”问题。
