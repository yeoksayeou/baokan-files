    Peking Duck: Year-Round Fattening
    ·Mò Jiāzhāng·
    The "Peking Duck" is a fine breed of duck cultivated and selected by the working people of our country over a long period. Whenever people want it to be fat, it can become fat.

    This duck originally came from the western suburbs of Beijing. Through continuous promotion, especially after liberation, the areas raising this duck have gradually increased. Domestically, the suburbs of cities like Shanghai and Tianjin also raise this duck. Abroad, the Soviet Union, the United States, and Britain have also long raised this duck. This spring, our country supplied a batch of "Peking Duck" fertilized eggs to the People's Democratic countries. These countries will also have "Peking Ducks" now.

    The "Peking Duck" has snow-white feathers, orange-yellow beak and feet, and a stout body, making it very attractive.

    The advantages of the "Peking Duck" can be summarized as follows: Large size: Ordinary ducks weigh two to three *jin* each; "Peking Ducks," after force-feeding, weigh seven to nine *jin* each. Fast growth: Ordinary ducks take one hundred days to grow to two *jin*; "Peking Ducks" take just over sixty days to grow to three and a half *jin*. Laying many large eggs: "Peking Ducks" lay one hundred and twenty to one hundred and eighty eggs a year, each weighing three *liang*; ordinary ducks lay an average of eighty to ninety eggs a year, each weighing only about two *liang*. In addition, "Peking Ducks" are strong and highly adaptable.

    The "Peking Ducks" raised in the suburbs of the capital are mostly supplied to roast duck restaurants in the city to make Peking duck. In order to continuously supply the city's needs throughout the year, the duck farmers in the suburbs of the capital have created a special method of raising ducks. One method is to change the living conditions of the ducks, forcing them to shed their feathers and controlling their egg-laying period. The other is to use specially made feed and artificial force-feeding (i.e., cramming), forcing them to develop and become fat. In this way, people can get tender and fat ducks all year round.

    The main areas raising "Peking Ducks" in the suburbs of Beijing are in the Yuquan Mountain area in the western suburbs. Many agricultural cooperatives here regard raising this duck as a sideline production. Some state-owned farms in the suburbs of Beijing also raise large numbers of "Peking Ducks." The state-owned Beijing Western Suburb Farm raises more than 30,000 "Peking Ducks." Because "Peking Ducks" grow fast, are easy to fatten, and lay many eggs, raising this duck is very profitable.

### 北京鸭四季肥

    北京鸭四季肥
    ·莫家璋·
    “北京鸭”是我国劳动人民长期培养、选育出来的一个好鸭种。人们要它什么时候肥，它就能什么时候肥。
    这种鸭子原产北京西郊，经过不断的推广，特别是解放以后的推广，饲养这种鸭子的地区渐渐多起来了。在国内，上海、天津等城市郊区都饲养这种鸭子；在国外，苏联、美国、英国也早已饲养这种鸭子。今年春季，我国供应人民民主国家一批“北京鸭”的种卵。这些国家，也要有“北京鸭”了。
    “北京鸭”毛色雪白，嘴、脚橘黄，体格肥壮，外形很好看。
    “北京鸭”的优点，概括起来，有下面几个：个子肥大：普通鸭子每只重二、三斤；“北京鸭”经过填肥，每只重七至九斤。生长的快：普通鸭子饲养一百天才能长到二斤重；“北京鸭”饲养六十多天就能长到三斤半。生的蛋多而大：“北京鸭”一年能下一百二十到一百八十个蛋，每个蛋重三两；普通鸭每年平均生八、九十个蛋，每个重量不过二两左右。此外，“北京鸭”体质强壮，适应性很强。
    首都郊区饲养的“北京鸭”，大部是供给市内的烤鸭店制做烤鸭用的。首都郊区的养鸭农民为了一年四季源源不断地供应市内的需要，创造了一套特殊的饲育鸭子的方法。这种方法一个是改变鸭子的生活条件，强迫它脱换羽毛，控制它的生蛋期。另一个是用特制的饲料，实行人工填喂（就是填鸭），迫使它发育肥胖。这样，人们在一年四季就能得到又嫩又肥的鸭子。
    北京郊区养“北京鸭”的地区，主要在西郊玉泉山一带。这里的许多农业合作社都把饲养这种鸭子作为副业生产。北京郊区的一些国营农场也饲养大量的“北京鸭”。国营北京西郊农场饲养的“北京鸭”有三万多只。由于“北京鸭”生长快、容易喂肥，产卵又多，饲养这种鸭子收益很大。
