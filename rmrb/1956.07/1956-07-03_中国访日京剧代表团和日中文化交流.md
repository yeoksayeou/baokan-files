Chinese Peking Opera Troupe's Visit to Japan and Sino-Japanese Cultural Exchange
Japanese Playwright Kinoshita Junji

I did not expect Peking Opera to be so unanimously praised by Japanese people from all walks of life. Before the Chinese Peking Opera Troupe visited Japan, Japanese audiences, in addition to curiosity, also harbored a feeling that it was nothing special and not easy to understand. Indeed, not understanding the language is a great obstacle to appreciating drama. However, after the performances, according to the feedback I heard from the audience, without exception, they all said: "I understand!" or "Surprisingly easy to understand." This naturally does not mean that they understood every detail of the lines, but that the excellent expressiveness of Peking Opera's acting and the beauty of its form conquered the Japanese audience, and the wonderful content of Peking Opera touched the hearts of the Japanese audience. Pantomimes and works that do not need to be fully understood through language, such as "San Cha Kou" and "Havoc in Heaven," were universally welcomed by the audience, which is very natural. Among intellectuals, programs such as "The Reconciliation of General and Prime Minister" and "Farewell My Concubine" were also praised for their strong dramatic nature and expressiveness.

However, what truly captivated the Japanese audience was not just the visual appeal and entertainment value of Peking Opera. Take Mei Lanfang's "The Drunken Concubine," performed on the first night, as an example. Yang Guifei, waiting for Emperor Tang Minghuang in the Hundred Flower Pavilion, drowns her sorrows in wine when she hears that the emperor is not coming. The beautiful singing and dancing that expressed her drunken state and changes in mood truly delighted us. But what Mr. Mei expressed here was not just this kind of beauty. This noblewoman, with "three thousand beauties in the harem, all favored by one," despite her extremely beautiful appearance, also had a perhaps unconscious emptiness and suffering in her heart. Mr. Mei vividly expressed Yang Guifei's poignant feelings and her humanity hidden behind the gorgeous attire and light singing and dancing. Therefore, we, the Japanese audience, were able to be deeply moved while reveling in the beautiful singing and dancing on the stage and also deeply sympathizing with this woman. This outstanding artistic achievement, formed by tradition, refinement, and creativity, captivated the Japanese audience.

Today, when we say Japanese audience, naturally many of them harbor doubts or antipathy towards communism in their thoughts and feelings. However, these people's thoughts and feelings did not prevent them from welcoming the Peking Opera Troupe, appreciating, and understanding Peking Opera. If it is said that this is also very natural, it is certainly not impossible, but it must be said that this is an unexpected success of the Peking Opera Troupe. As the old saying goes: "Art knows no borders." This time, we have once again strongly felt the true meaning of this sentence.

However, if we think a little deeper about the success of the Peking Opera performance, we will first discover the fact that since Mr. Mei Lanfang's visits to Japan in 1919 and 1924, Japanese audiences have had a very good impression of him. The name of the famous actor Mei Lanfang has maintained a mysterious charm among Japanese audiences for thirty or forty years, even among those who have never seen Mr. Mei's plays. Moreover, Mr. Ouyang Yuqian studied in Japan in 1904 and had a relationship with the Japanese "New School" drama at that time and performed in Japanese theaters. This is also a major reason why the visit of the Chinese Peking Opera Troupe to Japan evoked a very intimate feeling among Japanese audiences, especially the seniors in the Japanese theater circle who knew about these things.

Before the Chinese Peking Opera Troupe arrived in Japan, the Japanese audience already had such a sense of closeness to it, and there are some historical reasons for this. But this is also the result of the gradual formation of Sino-Japanese cultural exchanges in the post-war period. To name a few major events: the visit of the Chinese Red Cross delegation led by Ms. Li Dequan to Japan, the visit of the Japanese Academic Conference delegation to China, the visit of the Chinese Science Delegation led by Mr. Guo Moruo to Japan, the performance of the Japanese Kabuki Troupe in China, the exhibition of Chinese commodities in Japan, and so on. In addition, countless representatives from all walks of life in Japan have been invited to visit China.

Among the Japanese who returned from China, there are naturally individuals who published critical and emphasized the shortcomings of China in their travelogues, and there are also readers who felt "relieved" after reading these travelogues and feeling that "China is not all good after all!" However, at least as far as I know, even those so-called "relieved" people feel in their own hearts that their "relief" is illusory. Because despite some people nitpicking, the new China is advancing with vigorous strides, which is a reality, and the vast majority of people in Japan, although they may not actively promote these things, will unyieldingly move in this direction once they know the truth about the new China, which is also a reality.

I believe that the success of the Chinese Peking Opera Troupe's visit to Japan is indirectly the result of the powerful role played by the combination of many factors mentioned above. Without these, merely out of curiosity, the Kabuki-za Theater with 2,600 seats would not have had seven consecutive sold-out performances, and the phenomenon of secretly trading so-called black market tickets at prices several times higher than the already high ticket prices would not have occurred.

Through the performance of the Chinese Peking Opera Troupe, the Japanese audience strongly felt the historical relationship between the peoples of China and Japan sharing the same script and race. In addition to the wonderful content and expressive techniques of Peking Opera, there is also a kind of emotion that can be called common to both nations, which connects the vast stage of the Kabuki-za Theater and the audience. At this time, the art of Peking Opera eliminated the "national borders" between the two countries. The visit and performance of the Chinese Peking Opera Troupe to Japan deepened and expanded the achievements of Sino-Japanese cultural exchanges that have been continuing for the past few years.

Last year, the Japanese Kabuki Troupe visited China. At that time, they were treated as state guests in China, which deeply moved the members of the troupe; this news was also transmitted to the Japanese people by many Japanese newspapers and magazines, which also deeply moved the Japanese people. The Japanese Kabuki Troupe's visit to China was at the invitation of the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries. However, regrettably, the current Japan cannot host the Chinese Peking Opera Troupe's visit to Japan on a national scale with government funding. As a result, the largest private newspaper, "Asahi Shimbun," came forward to invite them. The Japan-China Friendship Association, the Japan-China Cultural Exchange Association, the Shochiku Company which provided the theater, and many groups in the entertainment industry such as Mr. Matsuo Kunizo wholeheartedly did their best to assist. The Welcome Committee for the Chinese Peking Opera Troupe's Visit to Japan, gathered around the Asahi Shimbun and composed of representatives from the Japanese cultural circles, made every effort to prepare. However, Japan's welcome preparations were really not enough. We were very ashamed of this, and we were carrying out this work nervously while conducting self-criticism.

Last year, I saw Mr. Yuan Shihai's performance of "Eliminating the Three Evils" in Beijing and greatly admired his acting skills. Later, I had the honor of meeting Mr. Yuan at the Chinese Peking Opera Theatre. As soon as Mr. Yuan met me, he said: "If there is anything that is not good enough, please offer criticism." When we parted, he shook my hand tightly and said: "See you in Japan next time!" Frankly speaking, I had no confidence in whether this could be realized at the time. Since then, eight months have passed, and thanks to the efforts of the peoples of China and Japan, various difficulties have been overcome. Now I can hear Mr. Yuan's loud singing voice again at the Kabuki-za Theater in Tokyo. For me, in addition to the excitement I got from Peking Opera itself, it is a double joy and emotion. Eleven years after Japan's surrender, Sino-Japanese cultural exchanges have finally reached such a point. We should take this opportunity to deeply reflect on the path we have taken in the past. We should fully exchange the kind of "unceremonious constructive criticism" that Mr. Yuan Shihai said between the peoples of the two countries. I believe that if we really want the joy and emotion that the visit of the Chinese Peking Opera Troupe to Japan has brought us to blossom and bear fruit, the best way is to promote the normalization of diplomatic relations between China and Japan as soon as possible!

    中国访日京剧代表团和日中文化交流
    日本剧作家　木下顺二
    我没有想到京剧会像这样受到各阶层日本人的一致赞扬。中国访日京剧代表团来日本访问前，日本观众对于京剧所怀抱的期待中，除了一种好奇心之外，同时也掺杂着一种认为没有什么了不起、反正不容易看懂的心情的。的确，不懂语言，对于欣赏戏剧是个极大的障碍。可是在公演之后，据我所听到的观众的反响，无例外地都是说：“看懂啦！”或者说：“出乎意外地容易懂。”这自然不是说直到台词的细微末节他们都听懂了，而是说京剧演技所具有的出色的表现力和它的形式的优美征服了日本观众，京剧的美妙的内容也打动了日本观众的心弦。哑剧以及不必完全通过语言去理解的作品，如“三岔口”、“闹天宫”等等受到了观众普遍欢迎，这是很自然的。在知识分子中间，“将相和”、“霸王别姬”等节目也以其强烈的戏剧性和表现力受到了赞赏。
    但是，使日本观众真正倾倒的，决不是仅仅由于京剧的悦目和有趣。就以头一天晚上演出的梅兰芳先生的“贵妃醉酒”为例吧。在百花亭等待唐明皇的杨贵妃，当她听说皇帝不来后，就借酒消愁。表现那醉态和心情变化的美妙歌舞，确实使我们赏心悦耳。但梅先生在这里所表现的，并不仅仅是这方面的美。这个“后宫佳丽三千人，三千宠爱在一身”的贵妇人、尽管她有极其艳丽的外表，但心里却也有着也许不自觉的空虚和苦闷。梅先生淋漓尽致地表现了藏在那华装丽服和轻歌妙舞后面的杨贵妃的凄切心情以及她的人性。因而，我们日本观众才能在陶醉于舞台上的美妙歌舞的同时，也深深同情这个妇女，而受到巨大的感动。这种集传统、洗炼和创意而形成的杰出的艺术成果，使日本观众为之倾倒。
    今天，我们说的日本观众，自然其中有很多人在思想感情上对共产主义抱有怀疑或反感。但是这些人的这种思想感情，并没有妨碍他们欢迎京剧团、欣赏和理解京剧。如果说这也是很自然的，固然也无不可，但是不能不说这是京剧团的出人意外的成功。老话说：“艺术无国境”这次我们又重新强烈地体会了这句话的真正含义。
    然而，我们如果对京剧公演的成功这件事稍微深入地想想，首先就会发现这样的事实：梅兰芳先生在1919年、1924年访问日本演出以来，日本观众就对他很有好感，名演员梅兰芳的名字，三、四十年来，在一次都没有看到过梅先生的戏的日本观众之间可以说是一直保持着一种神秘的魅力。而且，欧阳予倩先生在1904年曾在日本留学，和当时日本的“新派”剧有过关系，并且在日本的剧场演过戏，这也是为什么在知道这些事情的日本观众特别是日本戏剧界的前辈们之间，为这次中国访日京剧代表团的来访引起了非常亲切之感的很大理由。
    中国访日京剧代表团到达日本之前，日本观众就已经对它有着这样的亲近之感，是有着这样一些历史的原因的。但这也是在战后日中两国文化交流的过程中，无形中逐步形成的结果。举大的事情来说，例如：李德全女士等中国红十字会代表团的访日，日本学术会议代表团的访华，郭沫若先生等中国科学代表团的访日，日本歌舞伎剧团的访华演出，中国商品展览会在日本的展出等等。此外还有无数的日本各界的代表人士应邀访问过中国。
    从中国回来的日本人，其中自然不无个别的发表挑剔并且强调中国的缺点的访问记之类的人，而且也不无读了这些访问记感到“中国毕竟也不是什么都好！”从而感到所谓“安心”的读者。但是，至少据我所知，那些所谓“安心”的人们，连他们自己内心也感到他们的“安心”是虚幻的。因为尽管有人吹毛求疵，但新中国却是以雄劲的步伐向前发展，这是现实，而且，日本国内的广大人民，虽然他们也许不去积极宣传这些，但是一旦知道了新中国的真相，就会不屈不挠地向这个方向走去，这也是现实。
    我以为，这次中国访日京剧代表团的成功，间接地也是由于上面所说的这许多因素加在一起发挥了有力的作用的结果。如果没有这些，仅仅是由于好奇心，那末拥有二千六百个座位的歌舞伎座也就不会有连续七场超额满座的事情了，也就不会发生用超出本来就已很高的票价数倍的价钱暗中买卖所谓黑票的现象了。
    通过中国访日京剧代表团的演出，日本观众重新强烈地感到了日中两国人民同文同种的历史关系。除了京剧的美妙的内容和表现手法以外，还有一种可以叫做两民族共通的感情，把那广大的歌舞伎座的舞台和观众席连成了一片。京剧这种艺术，这个时候是把两国间的“国境”消除了。中国访日京剧代表团的来日演出，把这几年来一直继续进行着的日中文化交流获得的成果加深了，并且扩展了。
    去年，日本歌舞伎剧团访问了中国。当时在中国受到了国宾的礼遇，使剧团的人们深受感动；这个消息又由许多日本报纸杂志传给了日本人民，也使日本人民为之深深感动。日本歌舞伎剧团的访问中国，是接受中国人民对外文化协会的邀请而去的。但遗憾的是，现在的日本，不能以政府资助的国家规模来招待中国访日京剧代表团，结果是由民间最大的报社“朝日新闻社”来出面邀请的。日中友好协会、日中文化交流协会、提供剧场的松竹公司以及松尾国三先生等娱乐业界等许多团体，都由衷地尽力协助。以朝日新闻社为中心聚集起来的、由日本文化界的代表们组成的欢迎中国访日京剧代表团委员会，尽全力进行了准备工作。但是，日本的欢迎准备工作是实在不够的。这件事使我们非常抱愧，我们一面进行着自我批评，一面紧张地进行着这一工作。
    去年，我在北京看到了袁世海先生演的“除三害”，对他的演技大为佩服。后来我又有幸在中国京剧院会见了袁先生。袁先生一见面就说：“有什么不够的地方，请提出批评。”分别的时候，他又紧紧握着我的手说：“下次在日本见吧！”坦白地说，当时我对这事能否实现是没有信心的。从那时候起，过了八个月，由于日中两国人民的努力，克服了种种困难。现在我又能在东京歌舞伎座听到了袁先生的宏亮的歌声。这对我来说，加上从京剧本身所得到的激动，是双重的喜悦和感动。日本投降后的第十一年，日中两国的文化交流好容易才达到现在这样的地步，我们应该借着这个机会，深刻地反省一下从前所走的道路。我们应该在两国人民之间，充分交换袁世海先生所说的那种“不客气的建设性的批评”。我相信，如果真正要使中国京剧代表团访日带给我们的喜悦和感动开花结实，最好的途径是早日促成日中两国邦交的正常化！
