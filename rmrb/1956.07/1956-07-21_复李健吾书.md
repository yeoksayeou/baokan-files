    Dear Comrade Li Jianwu:

    Reading your letter to me in the People's Daily, everyone was very excited and talked about "Letter to Danni" all day long. On behalf of myself and all the actors of "Romeo and Juliet," I thank you for your concern and encouragement. Thank you for giving us such specific and valuable advice.

    You said that the Capulet's garden is too small, like a Shanghai alley house, and I agree. Because the stage is too small and we wanted to change scenes quickly, we sacrificed the poetic atmosphere and the beauty of the environment. The actors themselves also agree that the soliloquies in that scene were indeed recited loudly because they were afraid the audience wouldn't hear them. Because the general opinion of the audience is that they can't hear the lines clearly. This shows that our actors are still young, still lack experience, and are not able to read the lines "just right" as you said. Another point is the moving scenery. Some people have also given us similar opinions to yours. But regarding this point, I have some of my own superficial views. I think this is the style of the entire set design. Shakespearean drama sets don't need to be completely realistic; this automatic set is not for conjuring tricks, but to connect scenes one and two of Act Two. Of course, we could easily push the scenery in the dark. However, given this style, it is okay to unfold the scene on the other side of the wall in front of the audience. I quite like this approach, and I have heard many people in the theater praising it. Regarding this point, opinions are also divided among our actors and staff. The above is just a little immature opinion of my own.

    Your praise of me is excessive; I lack experience. We still have many shortcomings; this is just an initial attempt at performing Shakespearean drama. I thank you again and hope you will care for us and guide us more in the future.

                                                 Danni

    复李健吾书
    丹尼亲爱的李健吾同志：
    从人民日报上读了您给我的信，大家都很兴奋，整天都在谈着“与丹尼书”。我代表我自己和“柔密欧与幽丽叶”的全体演员向您致谢，谢谢您对我们的关心和鼓舞。谢谢您给我们提出这样具体和宝贵的意见。
    你说凯布家的花园太小，像上海的阔弄堂房子，我是同意的。由于舞台太小，又希望换景换得快，因此损失了诗的气氛和环境的优美。演员们自己也同意，在那场戏当中的独白，的确是怕观众听不见，才高声朗诵的。因为观众普遍的意见是听不清台词。这就说明了我们的演员还年轻，还缺乏锻炼，还不能够像您说的把台词念得“恰到好处”。再一点，就是自己会走动的布景了。也有人给我们提过类似您提出的意见。但是对于这一点，我有一些自己的粗浅看法，我认为，这是这次整个布景设计的风格，莎士比亚戏剧的布景不需要完全真实；这个自动布景不是为了变戏法，而是为了把第二幕一场和二场的戏联接起来。当然，我们很容易在暗场中推动布景。但是，既然是这种风格，也就不妨在观众面前展开围墙另一面的情景。我很喜欢这样的做法，我在剧场中也听到不少人对它的赞赏。关于这一点，就是在我们演员和工作人员当中，意见也是不一致的。以上仅仅是我个人的一点不成熟的看法。
    您对我的夸奖太过份了，我很缺乏经验。我们还有很多缺点，这不过是莎士比亚戏剧演出的一个初次尝试。我再次谢谢您，希望您以后更多的关怀我们，指导我们。
                                                 丹尼
