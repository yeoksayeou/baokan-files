    Chinese Medicine Research Institute Compiles Classical Works of Traditional Chinese Medicine

    (Our newspaper reports) The Chinese Medicine Textbook Editorial Committee of the Chinese Medicine Research Institute, since April, after three months of selfless labor, has cooperatively completed the language translation work of four classical works: "Essentials of the Inner Canon," "Treatise on Cold Damage," "Golden Chamber," and "Materia Medica Classic," as well as the editing work of five Chinese medicine textbooks: Internal Medicine, Surgery, Acupuncture, Materia Medica, and History of Traditional Chinese Medicine. In order to make these books more complete, the Chinese Medicine Research Institute has decided to print and publish a portion of them at the end of July, and distribute them to Chinese and Western medical organizations and Chinese and Western medical experts across the country for discussion, and then revise and publish them based on everyone's opinions.

    中医研究院编译中医经典著作
    本报讯　中医研究院中医教材编辑委员会自四月份以来，经过三个月忘我的劳动，合作完成了四部经典著作——内经知要、伤寒论、金匮、本草经等语译工作和五部中医教材——内科、外科、针灸、本草、中医学史等编辑工作。为了使这几部书更加完善，中医研究院决定在七月底先印刷出版一部分，分送全国各地中西医学团体和中西医学家，组织讨论，然后根据大家的意见进行修改出版。　（高辉远）
