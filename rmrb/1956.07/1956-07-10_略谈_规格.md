    A Brief Talk on "Specifications"
    Ding San
    A little over two months ago, I passed through a county town in Zhejiang and went into a "Cooperative Restaurant." As soon as I started ordering, I ran into a problem: the variety of dishes was limited, to say nothing of that, the most difficult thing to deal with was the "specifications" of the dishes. For example, the "Three Delicacies Stir-fry," according to the "specifications," must include fatty pork chunks, lean meat balls, bamboo shoot pieces, squid slices..., none could be missing. I said I couldn't eat that much alone, and I didn't like some of those ingredients. I asked for a dish of shredded pork stir-fried with bamboo shoots instead, without making it the "Three Delicacies Stir-fry". The answer was: "No, we don't have such a specification here."
    I'm not surprised that dishes have specifications, but are these kinds of "specifications" really necessary?
    The reason for these "specifications" is clearly a misunderstanding of the meaning of cooperation on the part of the "Cooperative Restaurant's" managers and cooks. They don't understand that a restaurant after cooperation should and can better serve its customers, and should not force customers with different needs and tastes to all eat the "Three Delicacies Stir-fry" that meets the "specifications". I think, as long as their thinking is straightened out, these "specifications" are easy to break, and perhaps have already been broken.
    What is relatively not easy to break is the "specifications" of articles.
    Articles are not absolutely without specifications, but they absolutely do not need the "eight-legged essay" style of specifications. Many people have talked about the disadvantages of such specifications. When newspapers publish articles that meet the "specifications" and force readers to read them, the situation is at its worst like that "Cooperative Restaurant" forcing me to eat the "Three Delicacies Stir-fry" that meets the "specifications."
    Beijing cuisine has the flavor of Beijing cuisine, Sichuan cuisine has the characteristics of Sichuan cuisine, and they each have their own specifications and styles. And the cooking arts of high-level Beijing cuisine chefs or Sichuan cuisine chefs have their similarities, but also their differences, and each has its own style. Only by constantly developing personal creativity can we enrich the characteristics of various types of dishes, so that customers who already like to eat this or that dish will like it even more, and their taste level will continue to improve. True specifications and style should be living things with creativity and vitality, and its great enemy is dead "specifications." Once you encounter dead "specifications," all living things will die. It's the same with cooking, and especially with writing articles, and how is it not the same with handling affairs and doing work!
    Then, boldly breaking dead "specifications" and carefully creating living specifications and living styles, is it just a matter for chefs and writers?

### 略谈“规格”

    略谈“规格”
    丁三
    两个多月前，我路过浙江某县城，走进一家“合作饭店”。一点菜，便碰到难关：菜的品种少，姑且不说，最难应付的是菜的“规格”。例如炒三鲜吧，照“规格”，一定要包含肥肉块、精肉丸子、笋块、鱿鱼片……，缺一不可。我说一个人吃不了这么多，其中有几样也不爱吃。来一盆肉丝炒笋片吧，不要这样炒三鲜。回答是：“不行，这里没有这样的规格。”
    菜有规格，我不奇怪，但有这样的“规格”吗？
    产生这样“规格”的原因，显然是“合作饭店”的经理和厨师们对合作化意义的误解。他们不懂得合作化后的饭馆应该而且能够更好地为顾客服务，不应该硬要在需要上和口味上不相同的顾客们一律吃合“规格”的炒三鲜。我想，只要思想一通，这“规格”是容易打破的，也许已经打破了。
    比较不容易打破的是文章的“规格”。
    文章也不是绝对没有规格的，但绝对不需要八股式的“规格”。关于这样规格的坏处，许多人谈过了。报刊发表合“规格”的文章，硬要读者看，情况最坏的时候就像那家“合作饭店”硬要我吃合“规格”的炒三鲜一样。
    京菜有京菜的味道，川菜有川菜的特色，它们各有各的规格和风格。而高明的京菜厨师们或川菜厨师们的做菜艺术有其相同处，也有其不同处，也各有各的风格。只有不断发挥个人的创造性，才能丰富各种类型的菜的特色，使本来喜欢吃这样那样菜的顾客更喜欢吃，使他的味觉水平不断提高。真正的规格和风格应该是有创造性和生命力的活东西，它的大敌就是死的“规格”。一碰到死“规格”，一切活东西便呜呼哀哉了。做菜如此，写文章尤其如此，办事做工作又何尝不是如此！
    那么大胆地打破死“规格”，细心地创造活规格、活风格，难道仅仅是厨师和作家的事？
