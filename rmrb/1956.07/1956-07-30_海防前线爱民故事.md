  I. Before the Storm
　　One early summer morning, a thick fog enveloped the calm sea. Two hundred fishing boats from a certain area of Fujian raised their white sails and set out for the fishing grounds. That same day, at nine o'clock in the morning, the fisheries production cooperative received an emergency notice from the meteorological station: there would be a storm at sea around twelve o'clock, with winds of force seven to eight.
　　The naval unit at the harbor received the meteorological station's notice. The commanders and fighters immediately thought of the fishing boats at sea and were worried about them. At this time, the head of a certain unit of the naval troops gathered the soldiers on the deck and said firmly:
　　"We are the people's servants, and we must inform the fishing boats at sea before the big storm arrives, so that the fishing boats can return safely!"
　　The soldiers weighed anchor and set sail, speeding towards the fishing grounds. The sea wind whipped the waves against the soldiers' bodies and faces. Many people's clothes were soaked, and the seawater flowed down their necks and over their bodies. The soldiers fought the wind and waves at sea for a long time, searching everywhere for the fishing boats, but the heavy fog prevented them from seeing anything. The wind and waves grew stronger, but the soldiers still hadn't found the fishing boats. Under the calm command of their commander, they continued to forge ahead through the waves.
　　At nearly eleven o'clock, the soldiers finally found the fishing boats near a small island. They immediately used loudspeakers to tell the fishermen about the meteorological station's emergency notice. When the wind force at sea increased to level six, more than two hundred fishing boats had already returned safely.

  II. Forty-two Lives
　　One Sunday morning, two F-84 American-made Chiang Kai-shek planes appeared over Wuyu Island, bombing and strafing the island's fishing village. The men and women on the island all hid in air-raid shelters. Under the fierce fire of the People's Liberation Army's anti-aircraft artillery, one American-made Chiang Kai-shek plane was shot down, and the other fled in panic.
　　The wreckage of this Chiang Kai-shek plane happened to fall on the entrance of an air-raid shelter for residents on the island. Burning gasoline flowed into the air-raid shelter, and the bullets on the plane wreckage exploded crackling in the flames. In the air-raid shelter, which was filled with thick smoke, forty-two civilians were hiding. They were almost unable to breathe, and the entrance was blocked by exploding bullets.
　　At this extremely critical moment, officers and soldiers of a certain company stationed on the island arrived. They immediately went into the cave in batches to rescue the people. The deputy company commander and deputy instructor first led five soldiers, braving the thick smoke and flames, and rushed into the cave, rescuing four people. When the officers and soldiers entered the cave for the third time, there was no oxygen in the cave, and the civilians still inside had passed out. The officers and soldiers gritted their teeth, covered their mouths with wet handkerchiefs, and continued to carry out the rescue. Squad leader Li Shifeng and soldier Li Bingzhi saw an old man in his seventies whose face was burned, and a woman in her thirties holding a baby less than one year old lying straight in the cave. Without regard for their own breathlessness, they carried the three of them out with all their strength.
　　All forty-two civilians were finally rescued by the officers and soldiers. Then, the officers and soldiers used "artificial respiration" to give emergency treatment to those who were unconscious. Some gave boiled water to those who were burned, and the military doctors and medics bandaged them and gave them stimulant injections. After more than an hour of rescue, forty-two lives were completely out of danger.

  III. Soldier and Girl
　　One afternoon, the Chiang Kai-shek army's artillery stationed on Jinmen Island began firing on our coastal villages. Zhang Zhenguang, a soldier in the communications platoon of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army, was inspecting the telephone lines in the face of the artillery fire. On the road, he saw a four- or five-year-old girl who was frightened by the sound of the artillery shells and didn't know where to go. He quickly went over and picked up the girl, preparing to take her to a nearby air-raid shelter. Suddenly, several more Chiang Kai-shek shells fell nearby. Zhang Zhenguang quickly lay down, shielding the girl with his body. After the shells exploded one after another, he picked up the girl again, braving the smoke and running into the air-raid shelter in one breath.

    海防前线爱民故事　
    新华社前线记者
  一、风暴到来之前
    初夏的一个早晨，浓雾笼罩着平静的海面。福建某地两百条渔船扬起白帆驶向渔场。就在这一天上午九点钟，渔业生产合作社里接到气象台的紧急通报：十二点钟左右，海上将有风暴，风力是七级到八级。
    海港上的水兵部队接到了气象台的通报，指战员们立刻想到了出海的渔船，都为它们担起忧来。这时，水兵部队某部的首长把水兵们集合到甲板上，斩钉截铁地说：
  “我们是人民的勤务员，一定要在大风暴到来之前给出海的渔船去报信，让渔船安全归来！”
    水兵们起锚开航，向渔场疾驶。海风卷着浪花打到水兵的身上和脸上。许多人的衣服湿透了，海水顺着脖子流遍全身。水兵们在海上与风浪搏斗了很长时间，到处寻找着渔船，但是重重浓雾使他们甚么也看不见。风浪越来越大了，水兵们还是没有发现渔船。他们在指挥员沉着的指挥下，继续破浪前进。
    将近十一点钟的时候，水兵们终于在一个小岛的附近找到了渔船。他们立刻用扩大器把气象台的紧急通报告诉渔民。当海上的风力增加到六级的时候，两百多条渔船已安全返航了。
  二、四十二条生命
    一个星期日的上午，有两架F—八四型美制蒋机出现在浯屿岛上空，向岛上的渔村进行轰炸和扫射。岛上的男男女女都躲到防空洞里去。在人民解放军高射炮部队的猛烈炮火下，美制蒋机一架被击落，另一架仓惶逃走了。
    这架蒋机的残骸恰恰坠落在岛上居民的一个防空洞口，燃烧着的汽油往防空洞内流去，飞机残骸上的子弹在烈火中噼啪地爆炸。在被浓烟充塞的防空洞里，这时还躲藏着四十二个老百姓，他们已经快喘不出气来，而洞口又给爆炸着的子弹堵住了。
    正当这万分危急的时刻，驻在这个岛的某连队的军官和战士们赶到了，他们立即分批进洞抢救。副连长和副指导员首先带领五个战士，冒着浓烟烈火冲进洞去，救出了四个人。当官兵们第三次进洞的时候，洞里已经没有氧气了，还在洞里的老百姓已经昏迷过去。官兵们咬紧牙关，用湿手帕掩着嘴，继续进行抢救。班长李世峰和战士李炳芝看到一个七十多岁的老大爷脸上给火烧伤了皮肤，一个三十多岁的大嫂怀抱着一个不满周岁的婴儿直挺挺地躺在洞里，他们顾不得自己喘不出气来，一股劲将他们三人抱出来。
    四十二个老百姓终于被官兵们全部救出来了。接着，官兵们用“人工呼吸法”给那些昏迷不醒的人进行急救，有的给被火烧伤的人喂开水，军医和卫生员又给他们包扎，打强心针。经过一个多钟头的救护，四十二条生命完全脱险了。
    三、战士与女孩
    一天下午，驻金门岛的蒋军炮兵向我沿海村庄开起炮来。人民解放军某部队通信排的战士张振广，这时候正在冒着炮火检查电话线路。他在路上看到一个四、五岁的小女孩被炮弹的爆炸声吓呆了，不知往哪里走才好。他连忙过去把女孩抱起来，准备把她送到附近的防炮洞去。忽然，附近又落下几发蒋军的炮弹。张振广连忙卧倒，用身子把女孩遮护起来。在炮弹连连爆炸以后，他又抱起女孩，冒着硝烟一口气跑进了防炮洞。
