The more than 100 million mu of double-cropping early rice across the country is now ready for harvest. In Guangdong and Fujian provinces, where the season is earlier, most of the harvest has already been completed. Farmers in these areas generally report that this year's early rice is growing particularly well, with uniform heading and plump grains, estimating at least a 10 to 20 percent increase compared to last year. Provinces with later seasons, such as Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, Zhejiang, and Jiangsu, are also showing a scene of abundant harvest.

The time when early rice is universally harvested coincides with the rainy season and flood season. Therefore, attention must be paid to timely harvesting. Generally, early-maturing indica rice varieties (such as Nantao No. 1) are more prone to shattering. If harvesting is delayed until they are overripe, losses may occur. In paddy fields that have already lodged or may lodge, special attention should be paid to rushing the harvest to prevent the rice from sprouting in the field.

This year, the early rice seeds in many areas were temporarily procured from other places, resulting in mixed varieties. Therefore, during the early rice harvest, seed selection and retention work should be done well to prepare seeds for next year.

To ensure a comprehensive bumper harvest of double-cropping rice, it is necessary not only to harvest early rice well but also to plant late rice well. Double-cropping late rice is highly seasonal. The appropriate season for transplanting late rice is before the Start of Autumn (early August). Transplanting late rice after the Start of Autumn may lead to reduced yields. To simultaneously do various farm works well, agricultural cooperatives must overcome the difficulty of labor shortages during the busy farming month of July, achieving simultaneous harvesting of early rice, plowing fields, and transplanting seedlings.

The general lack of fertilizer is a prominent problem in promoting double-cropping rice this year. It is understood that most areas have used fertilizer on early rice, so late rice is generally deficient in fertilizer. At present, it is very necessary to appropriately allocate some labor to accumulate fertilizer without affecting the main farm work. In terms of fertilization technology, advanced methods such as applying fertilizer at the harrowing mouth, dipping seedling roots, and inserting ash at the base of seedlings should be adopted to solve the problem of fertilizer shortage.

Currently, the late rice transplanting season has arrived. Agricultural cooperatives should check the quantity and growth of seedlings within the cooperative and prepare for transplanting.

Areas where the double-cropping rice plan is too large and is estimated to be difficult to complete should make appropriate adjustments based on local conditions. In some areas, the harvesting period of double-cropping early rice may be delayed until after the Start of Autumn. These areas should consider planting sweet potatoes, autumn potatoes, buckwheat, or cultivating ratooning rice and other late autumn crops after the early rice harvest to ensure the completion of this year's grain production tasks.

    收好早稻种好晚稻
  　娄其
    全国一亿多亩双季早稻，目前已经要收割了。季节较早的广东、福建等省已大部收割。这些地区的农民普遍反映，今年早稻生长特别好，出穗整齐、谷粒饱满，估计至少比去年多收一、二成。季节较晚的湖南、湖北、江西、浙江和江苏等省，也呈现一片丰收的景象。
    早稻普遍收割的时候，正是雨季汛期。因此必须注意收割及时。一般早熟的籼稻品种（如南特号等），都比较容易脱粒，如果等到过分成熟才收，就可能遭受损失。在已经发生倒伏或可能倒伏的稻田，应该特别注意抢收，以免水稻倒在田里发芽。
    今年许多地区的早稻种子都是临时从外地筹调的，品种混杂；因此，应该在收获早稻的期间，做好早稻选种，留种工作，为明年准备好种子。
    为了保证双季稻全面丰收，不但要收好早稻，而且要种好晚稻。双季晚稻的季节性很强。适宜插植晚稻的季节是在立秋前（八月上旬），过了立秋插晚稻，就有减产的可能。为了同时做好各种农活，各农业合作社必须在农事大忙的七月里，克服劳动力不足的困难，做到边收早稻、边犁田、边插秧。
    普遍缺乏肥料是今年推广双季稻中的一个突出问题。据了解，大部分地区已把肥料用在早稻上，因此晚稻普遍缺肥，目前在不影响主要农活的情况下，适当抽出一部分劳力进行积肥是很必要的。在施肥技术上，应该采用打耖口、蘸秧根、插安蔸灰等集中施肥的先进方法，以解决缺肥问题。
    目前晚稻插秧季节已经到来，各农业合作社应该检查社内秧苗数量和生长情况，做好插秧的准备。
    双季稻计划太大，估计确实难以完成的地区，应该根据当地具体情况加以适当调整。有些地区的双季早稻的收割期可能拖到立秋以后，这样的地区，应考虑在早稻收割后种红薯、秋马铃薯、荞麦或培育再生稻等晚秋作物，以保证完成今年粮食生产任务。
