Even an Honest Official Can't Judge a Ghost Case
　　　　Zhang Baoshen
　　A certain playwright, late at night under the lamp, opened an old script and began to adapt it. After revising a few pages, weariness struck, and he unconsciously fell asleep at his desk.
　　He felt himself drifting, drifting, to a place. The mountains and rivers were beautiful, but it was the West Lake. He walked along the lake and saw, in the distance under the shade of the willows, two women talking; looking closely, he realized they were the ghosts of Jiao Guiying and Li Huiniang. Li Huiniang held a withered red plum blossom in her hand, her brow furrowed with sorrow, stopping by the lakeside. The two ghosts were in conversation.
　　He heard Jiao Guiying asking, "I heard that sister once fiercely scolded Jia Sidao at the Banxian Hall, which was very gratifying. Why don't you scold him now?"
　　Li Huiniang sighed and said:
　　"Sister, you don't know, I can't go to Banxian Hall anymore."
　　"Why is that?"
　　"Since 'Red Plum Blossom' was changed to 'Touring the West Lake,' for some reason, the 'Ghost Debate' scene was completely deleted, and I no longer have the opportunity to appear on stage."
　　Jiao Guiying, upon hearing this, was touched in her heart and sighed. Li Huiniang asked:
　　"I heard that you went to the mortal world and captured the ungrateful Wang Kui. With the great revenge avenged, could there be other worries?"
　　Guiying said, "We sisters are truly in the same boat. Now the stage is plastered with a seal that says 'Break superstitions, ghosts retreat to their place,' and I can't go to capture Wang Kui either."
　　The more they talked, the sadder they became, and the more they talked, the more indignant they grew. Jiao Guiying suddenly had an idea and said:
　　"Lord Bao is impartial and selfless, we might as well go and ask him to make a fair judgment."
　　After the two reached an agreement, they immediately left the West Lake. The playwright quickly and secretly followed behind them. In an instant, they arrived at Kaifeng Prefecture, and the two beat the drum to cry injustice. Wang Chao and Ma Han quickly brought the two ghosts up to the main hall, and the playwright secretly followed inside.
　　Li Huiniang and Jiao Guiying, upon arriving at the court, recounted the playwright's deletion and revision of the script, preventing ghosts from appearing on stage, and other matters.
　　Upon hearing this, Bao Gong frowned and said with emotion: "I, Bao Zheng, have upheld justice and impartiality, and have exclusively judged matters of the yin and yang for hundreds of years. Now, the playwrights dislike me for being superstitious, and have cut off my authority to judge the yin, only allowing me to judge the yang. Therefore, I can only judge cases like Qin Xianglian's, and you are ghosts, which I can no longer manage. Recently, I also heard that some people, because I served the ruling class, do not allow the performance of public trial plays, and even I myself may soon be unable to appear on stage."
　　Upon hearing this, the playwright suddenly broke out in a cold sweat. Raising his head, he saw the lights were still bright, the strong tea was not cold, and it was all a dream…

    清官难断鬼官司
    张葆莘
    戏曲作家某，深夜在灯下展开一本旧剧，着手改编。改了几页，倦意袭来，不觉伏在书桌上睡着了。
    他只觉得悠悠荡荡，来到一个所在。山明水秀，却是西湖。他顺着湖边走了一程，远远看见柳荫之下，有两个女子在谈话；定睛一看，原来是敫桂英和李慧娘的鬼魂。李慧娘手里拿着一枝枯萎的红梅，愁眉苦脸地停在湖边。两个鬼魂正在互相倾谈。
    只听得敫桂英问道：“听说姐姐曾在半闲堂上痛骂贾似道，真是大快人心，现在为何不骂了呢？”
    李慧娘叹口气，说：
    “姐姐有所不知，小妹如今去不得半闲堂了。”
    “这是为甚？”
    “自从‘红梅记’改成了‘游西湖’，不知是何缘故，‘鬼辩’一折全被删掉，小妹也就无缘再登台了。”
    敫桂英听罢，触动了心事，便叹了一声。李慧娘问道：
    “闻得你曾到阳世间，活捉那忘恩负义的王魁。大仇已报，莫非还有别的心事不成？”
    桂英说：“我们姐妹真是同病相怜。现在舞台上贴着‘破除迷信，鬼魂退位’的封条，我也不能去活捉王魁了。”
    两人越说越难过，越说越激愤。敫桂英忽然灵机一动，说：
    “包公爷铁面无私，我们不妨前去请他公断公断。”
    两人商议妥当，当即离开西湖。戏曲作家赶紧偷偷跟在后面。顷刻之间，来到开封府，二人击鼓喊冤。王朝、马汉连忙把两名鬼魂带上大堂，戏曲作家也暗暗跟了进去。
    李慧娘、敫桂英到得公堂之上，将剧作家删改剧本，不许鬼魂登场诸事，诉说一遍。
    包公一听，紧皱眉头，感慨地说道：“想我包拯，秉公持正，专断阴阳，已数百载。如今，剧作家嫌我迷信，削去了断阴的职权，只准断阳。因而我只能断断秦香莲等人案件，你们乃是鬼魂，我已管不着了。近来还听说有人为了老夫是为统治阶级服务，不准上演公案戏，连我自家也快上不得台也。”
    戏曲作家一听，突然浑身出了一身冷汗。抬起头来，但见灯火犹明，浓茶未冷，原来是南柯一梦……。
