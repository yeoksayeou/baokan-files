European Travel Notes

Venice, the City of Water

Leaving the station, a steamboat took us to the Grand Canal of Venice. The banks were lined with medieval buildings, mostly in the Renaissance style, with delicate decorations; there were also other antique-style buildings, everywhere white marble and Roman columns, mostly engraved with beautiful reliefs. An Italian friend pointed out a very poetic courtyard, saying that this was the former residence of "Othello." The steamboat left the canal and entered a quiet bay. People said: "Marco Polo once set sail from here to travel to the great China. Now, it is very meaningful that Venice, Marco Polo's hometown, can welcome the Chinese theater troupe, which is visiting Italy for the first time in history."

Venice is a water city composed of many small islands, and every street is a canal. People either walk along the shore or take small wooden boats with high prows—"gondolas"—for transportation. Many small streets, or rather, small waterways, cannot accommodate steamboats; only a few large waterways have steamboats like buses. Naturally, this is a resort that attracts tourists, and everywhere are tourists speaking foreign languages. Only outsiders look around in amazement and rush to and fro. The local boatmen and shop assistants selling various souvenirs are very calm even when they are busy working. We couldn't help but ask our hosts: "In Venice, only wooden boats can travel on the small waterways. What do people do in case of emergencies?" The host humorously replied: "For Venetians, time is just an abstract concept." Indeed, in Italy and France, a performance scheduled to start at 8:00 PM will not start until at least 9:00 PM.

St. Mark's Square

This is Venice's only square. The magnificent St. Mark's Basilica shines brightly in the sun, and tens of thousands of tourists walk around as if attending a temple fair. The shops around the square sell all kinds of souvenirs: glassware is famous, from vases to necklaces, sculptures to tie clips. Many silver butterflies and boat-shaped tie clips are very similar to Beijing's products. Women admire the Venetian handmade embroidery and lace. (In Europe, anything "handmade" is considered superior; similarly, custom-made items are more upscale than ready-made ones).

In the square, hundreds of fearless pigeons fly around, waiting for tourists to throw them rice or breadcrumbs. Mass is being held in St. Mark's Basilica, with incense swirling and the singing sounding very pleasant. The gold-embroidered vestments of the clergy harmonize exceptionally well with the decorations inside the church. Some tourists climb to the roof of St. Mark's Basilica to see the gilded carvings on the roof, while more people look up at the beautiful battlements on the white high walls of the "Doge's Palace" next to the church. Everywhere are people taking pictures, and you often hear apologies for blocking someone else's shot. Crystal clear grapes hang on the fruit stalls, and the hot weather forces people to ignore washing them, buying a bag and devouring them in public.

At night, St. Mark's Square is filled with tables and chairs; these are open-air cafes, and the municipal band plays music on the stage in front of the church. To satisfy different preferences, they sometimes play classical music, but more often they play light music or dance music. Right next to it, the tide is lapping against the stone shore, and in the distance, the boatmen's songs are carried by the wind from the "gondolas." (Attached picture)

    水都威尼斯
    从车站出来，坐上汽船便到了威尼斯的大运河。两岸都是中世纪的建筑，其中最多的是文艺复兴式的，有着细致的装饰；也有其他仿古的建筑，到处是白色的大理石和罗马式的圆柱，大多还刻着美丽的浮雕。同行的意大利朋友指出其中一个很有诗意的庭园，说这就是“奥赛罗”的故居。汽船走出运河便是一个安静的海湾。人们说：“从前马可波罗便是从这里扬帆出海，到伟大的中国去旅行的。现在，马可波罗的故乡——威尼斯，能够欢迎在历史上还是第一次访问意大利的中国剧团，是很有意思的一件事。”
    威尼斯是许多小岛组成的一个水城，每条街道都是运河。人们要不就在岸边步行要不就坐上两端高耸的小木船——“冈多拉”来代步。许多小街道，不，应该说小河道上是不能行驶汽船的，只在几个大的河道才有像公共汽车一样的汽船。这里，当然是吸引游人的胜地，到处都是说着外国语言的游客。只有外地人才目不暇给地东张西望，匆忙地赶来赶去。而当地的船夫和出卖各色各样纪念品的商店店员，在忙着工作的时候也表现得非常从容。我们不由得要问起我们的主人们：“在威尼斯，小河道只能行驶木船，万一发生些紧急事情时，人们怎么办？”主人幽默地回答我们：“对于威尼斯人，时间只是个抽象的观念而已”。的确，在意大利和法国，写明八点钟开演的演出，至少要到九点钟才能开演呢。
    圣马可广场
    这是威尼斯的唯一的广场，金碧辉煌的圣马可教堂在太阳照射下闪闪发光，成千上万的游客们像赶庙会一样地走来走去。广场四周的商店出卖着各色各样的纪念品：玻璃料器是有名的，从花瓶到项练，塑像到领针。许多银制的蝴蝶和船形领针和北京的出品非常相似。妇女们赞赏着威尼斯的手工刺绣和花边。（在欧洲，凡是“手做的”都会被认为是上等的，同样，定做的也要比现成的要高贵一些）。
    在广场上，千百只不怕人的鸽子在飞来飞去，等待着游人把碎米或面包屑丢给它们。圣马可教堂正做着弥撒，香烟缭绕，唱诗的声音很是动听。教士们绣金的法衣和教堂内的装饰配合得异常谐调。有些游客爬到圣马可教堂的屋顶来参观房顶上镀金的雕刻，更多的人仰望着教堂紧邻的“公爵府”的白色高墙上美丽的城垛。到处是照像的人，也经常听见因为遮挡了别人的镜头而连连道歉的声音。水果摊上悬挂着晶莹的葡萄，炎热的天气迫得人们顾不得去洗它们了，买上一包便当众大嚼。
    夜晚，圣马可广场摆满了桌椅，这是露天的咖啡馆，市政府的乐队在教堂前的台子上奏着音乐。为了满足不同的爱好，有时也奏古典音乐，但更多的时候奏着轻音乐或跳舞音乐。就在旁边，海潮在拍打着石岸，远处“冈多拉”上随风传来船夫的歌声。（附图片）
