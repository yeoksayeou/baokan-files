Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 26th: This summer, the heat in Shanghai is rare for the past century, and it has become even hotter in the past two days. Yesterday, many industrial leadership departments and trade union organizations held emergency meetings to study how to implement the State Council's emergency notice on heatstroke prevention and cooling.

The Shanghai Iron and Steel Company has decided that in the New Joint Venture Steel Rolling Plant, where labor conditions are poor and delivery tasks are not urgent, it is prepared to reduce workers' working hours and stop production when the temperature is too high; in the steelmaking plant where work cannot be stopped, it is prepared to increase workers and extend rest time. The Shanghai No. 1 Steel Plant's converter workshop, where the workshop temperature is high, has decided to reduce the daily working hours of each shift of workers from an average of eight hours to six hours. In addition, the Shanghai Iron and Steel Company also requires all plants to establish "water curtain rest rooms" next to high-temperature workshops.

The construction administrative department and the trade union stipulate that construction workers should have four hours of rest time around noon every day; when the outdoor temperature reaches 108 degrees Fahrenheit, outdoor workers can be temporarily transferred to indoor work.

The East China Textile Administration Bureau, the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the China Textile Trade Union, and the Shanghai No. 1 Heavy Industry Bureau also held meetings to study how to further strengthen ventilation and cooling work, and strictly limit overtime.

Some departments have put forward many specific measures to further ensure that workers sleep well and increase workers' nutrition and cool drinks.

This newspaper reports: In order to implement the State Council's emergency notice on heatstroke prevention and cooling, the Beijing Municipal Labor Bureau, the Public Health Bureau, and the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions jointly convened a city-wide conference of labor protection personnel and medical personnel from administrative and trade unions of factories, mines, and transportation enterprises on the 27th. A total of more than 1,500 people attended the meeting. The meeting pointed out that many factories and mining enterprises have already taken or are taking measures to prevent heatstroke and cool down. For example, the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant held a telephone conference on the afternoon of the 25th to deploy this work to various workshops: a large supply of salt soda and traditional Chinese medicine herbal tea, increased temporary shelters, workers working in high-temperature workshops use small ice packs, and at the same time organize cooling inspection teams to start inspections from the 26th, and also contact the Meteorological Observatory, if they can know in advance that the temperature will be high the next day, they should take emergency measures the night before. However, some factories and mines have not paid attention to this work, and even work overtime, resulting in heatstroke, which seriously damages the safety and health of workers. For example, the Doudian Brick and Tile Factory had an average of 300 people falling ill every day from June 15th to 24th; and more than a dozen people at the Chenguang Pesticide Factory also suffered from heatstroke.

Therefore, the Municipal Labor Bureau and other departments require all factories and mining enterprises to submit emergency measures to improve heatstroke prevention and cooling work before next Tuesday. It is necessary to make full use of the original cooling equipment and natural ventilation, and add ventilation and cooling equipment where possible. In accordance with the provisions of the State Council, when necessary, employees working in high-temperature operations may temporarily stop production.

After the meeting, the inspection team jointly formed by the Municipal Labor Bureau, the Public Health Bureau, and the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions went to seven key factories with high-temperature operations, such as the Heating Material Factory and the Glass Factory, for inspection.

    上海北京决定紧急防暑
    新华社上海26日电　今年夏天，上海天气的炎热程度是近百年来少有的，最近两天更热了。昨天，许多工业领导部门和工会组织都召开紧急会议，研究如何贯彻执行国务院关于防暑降温的紧急通知。
    上海钢铁公司已经作出决定，在劳动条件很差、交货任务并不紧迫的新合营轧钢厂，准备减少工人工作时间，在温度过高的时候可以停止生产；在不能停工的炼钢厂，准备增加工人，延长休息时间。车间温度高的上海第一钢厂转炉车间，决定把每班工人每天的工作时间由八小时平均减少到六小时。此外，上海钢铁公司还要求各厂在高温车间旁边，普遍建立“水幕休息室”。
    建筑行政部门和工会规定，建筑工人在每天中午前后应该有四小时的休息时间；室外温度达到华氏一百零八度的时候，室外工人可以暂时调做室内工作。
    华东纺织管理局、中国纺织工会上海市委员会和上海市第一重工业局，也分别开会研究如何进一步加强通风降温工作，并且严格限制加班加点。
    有些部门对进一步保证工人睡得好、增加工人营养和清凉饮料等方面，都提出了许多具体措施。
    本报讯　北京市劳动局，公共卫生局和市工会为了贯彻执行国务院关于防暑降温的紧急通知，在二十七日联合召开了全市厂矿、交通运输企业行政、工会的劳动保护人员和医务人员大会。到会的共有一千五百多人，会上指出许多厂矿企业已经或正在采取防暑降温的措施。如石景山钢铁厂在二十五日下午就举行了电话会议，向各车间布置了这项工作：大量供应盐汽水和中药凉茶，增加临时凉棚，在高温车间作业的工人使用小冰袋，同时组织降温检查组，从二十六日起开始检查，又同气象台取得联系，如能事先知道第二天气温高，在前一天晚上就要采取紧急措施。但是有些厂矿还没有重视这一工作，甚至加班加点，以致发生中暑现象，严重地损害了工人的安全健康。如窦店砖瓦厂从六月十五日到二十四日平均每天有三百人得病；晨光农药厂也有十多人中暑。
    因此市劳动局等要求各厂矿企业在下星期二以前，提出改进防暑降温工作的紧急措施。必须充分利用原有降温设备和自然通风，和在可能条件下增加通风降温设备。按照国务院的规定，必要时，高温作业的职工可以暂时停止生产。
    会后，市劳动局、公共卫生局和市工会联合会联合组成的检查组分赴暖气材料厂和玻璃厂等七个高温作业的重点厂进行检查。
