Xinhua News Agency, July 21st: Paris Dispatch: The section of the joint statement by the heads of government of Yugoslavia, Egypt, and India that supports the rights of the Algerian people has caused dissatisfaction in French political circles.

    United Press International reported from Paris on July 20th: "The full text of the Brioni Communiqué has infuriated the Prime Minister's Office and the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs." The French Ministry of Foreign Affairs specifically issued a statement to defend France's policy in Algeria. The statement said that the French government "cannot even discuss" being subject to criticism regarding colonial rule, and that the expression of hope by the three countries of South-Egypt-India for a ceasefire in Algeria was "superfluous." It stated: "It doubts whether the Brioni joint statement will help resolve the Algerian issue." It also expressed concern that the joint statement by the three countries would "encourage" the Algerian people who are resisting this colonial rule.

    Xinhua News Agency, July 21st: Algiers Dispatch: The Governor-General of French Algeria, Lacoste, held a lengthy meeting on the 19th with French Minister of Defense Maurice Bourgès-Maunoury, Under-Secretary of the Army Levraud, Under-Secretary of the Interior Champeix, responsible for Algerian civil affairs, and senior military leaders regarding the situation in Algeria. According to Agence France-Presse, they discussed plans to launch a "summer offensive" against the Algerian people.

    Xinhua News Agency: Paris Dispatch: The Finance Committee of the French National Assembly recommended on the 19th that the term of military service be extended from the current eighteen months to two years in order to solve the need for troops in the Algerian war.

    The committee's report stated that doing so would avoid extending the service time of active-duty soldiers who have reached the end of their terms, and would also save the procedure of recalling reserve soldiers.

    Currently, in order to wage war in Algeria, the French authorities are extending the service time of active-duty soldiers whose terms have expired and are conscripting reservists into the army. People and soldiers in various parts of France have repeatedly held demonstrations against these measures.

    法国政府坚持殖民政策
    对南印埃联合声明表示不满
    据新华社21日讯　巴黎消息：南斯拉夫、埃及、印度三国政府首脑联合声明支持阿尔及利亚人民权利的一节在法国政界引起了不满。
    合众社七月二十日从巴黎发出的电讯说：“布里俄尼公报全文激怒了总理办公室和法国外交部。”法国外交部特地为此发表了声明，为法国在阿尔及利亚的政策辩护。这个声明说，法国政府“是谈不到”受关于殖民统治的批评的，南、埃、印三国表示希望在阿尔及利亚实现停火是“多余”的。它说：“它怀疑布里俄尼联合声明是否有助于阿尔及利亚问题的解决。”它并且表示担心三国联合声明会使得反抗这种殖民统治的阿尔及利亚人民得到“鼓励”。
    新华社21日讯　阿尔及尔消息：法国驻阿尔及利亚总督拉戈斯特在十九日同法国国防部长布歇—莫努里、陆军次长勒荣纳、负责阿尔及利亚民政的内政次长香佩以及高级军事领袖们就阿尔及利亚局势举行了长时间的会谈。据法新社说，他们讨论了对阿尔及利亚人民发动“夏季攻势”的计划。
    新华社讯　巴黎消息：法国国民议会财政委员会十九日建议把兵役期限由现在的十八个月延长到两年，以便解决在阿尔及利亚战争中所需要的兵源。
    这个委员会的报告说，这样做就可以避免延长现役军人的服役时间，也可以省去召回后备兵的手续。
    目前法国当局为了在阿尔及利亚进行战争而延长服役期满的现役军人的服役时间，并且征召后备兵入伍。法国各地人民和军人曾经屡次举行示威，反对这些措施。
