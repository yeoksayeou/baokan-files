    Good Harvests Shouldn't Mean Excessive Deductions and Low Distribution
    Twelve Agricultural Cooperatives Revise Summer Harvest Distribution Plans

    (Reported by this newspaper) Cadres from twelve agricultural production cooperatives in the Gangkou District of Zhongshan County, Guangdong Province, recently clarified their understanding of the principle of "less deductions and more distribution." Consequently, they revised their preliminary summer harvest distribution plans, ensuring that each work day would be compensated with approximately one yuan.

    These twelve cooperatives are large-scale cooperatives organized on a township basis. Due to the conversion of 95% of paddy fields to plowing during the spring planting season this year, an unprecedented bumper harvest of early rice is anticipated. According to on-site measurements, the early rice yield of each cooperative will increase by 60% to over 100% compared to last year. Seeing the good harvest, the cadres of these cooperatives believed that even if they distributed less to the members, the members would not object. Therefore, the initial preliminary distribution plan stipulated that only about 40% of the total income would be distributed to the members. They wanted to deduct more for capital construction expenses that could have been deducted over several years. Some cooperatives also deducted loans that could have been repaid during the late rice harvest. The Gangkou District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Zhongshan County realized that this preliminary distribution plan was inappropriate and helped them revise the preliminary distribution plan according to the principle of "less deductions and more distribution." The new plan was supported by the members, and in order to earn more income, the members are actively developing diversified operations.

### 收成好也不该多扣少分  十二个农业社重订夏收分配方案

    收成好也不该多扣少分
    十二个农业社重订夏收分配方案
    本报讯　广东省中山县港口区十二个农业生产合作社的干部最近明确认识了“少扣多分”的方针之后，重新制订夏收预分方案，使每个劳动日的报酬达到一元左右。
    这十二个社都是以乡为单位组成的大社。由于今年春耕的时候把95％的稻田改为翻耕，预计早稻可以获得空前的丰收。根据田间实测，各社的早稻产量都会比去年增加六成到一倍以上。这些社的干部看到这次的收成好，以为就是少分配一些给社员，社员也不会有意见，因此第一次制订的预分方案，规定只要把总收入的40％左右分配给社员。要多扣一些本来可以分几年扣除的基本建设费。有些社还扣除了可以在晚稻还的贷款。中共中山县港口区委员会发觉这个预分方案订得不妥当，帮助他们根据“少扣多分”的方针，重新制订了预分方案。新的方案得到社员的拥护，为了争取得到更多的收入，社员们正积极开展多种经营。
