    Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 19th: U.S. Secretary of State Dulles said at a press conference held on July 18 that it seems the whole world has a tendency to demand the reduction of armed forces. However, he explained that this tendency is due to people's recognition that the development of modern weapons makes manpower "not as important as before."
    He said that the general concept of American military policy is to "mainly rely on selective deterrent force." When discussing this issue, he refused to answer whether he himself was in favor of reducing the American armed forces. Dulles said that apart from news in the newspapers, he had not heard of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Radford, suggesting that the American armed forces be reduced by 800,000 by 1960. However, he said that he did not doubt that the Pentagon was discussing the issue of reducing American armed forces.
    Dulles said that if military figures propose suggestions for reducing manpower from their point of view, then he can't raise any reasons from a political point of view to oppose doing so. However, he believes that although the trend of reducing personnel may continue somewhat, the United States must maintain an "advantage" over the Soviet Union in nuclear weapons. He believes that this point is "extremely important" and does not allow "any special reductions in this area."
    When asked whether the United States might gradually withdraw its overseas bases due to the growth of neutralist sentiment and the development of new weapons, Dulles said that the cost of using the American continent as a base to take "retaliatory" actions is "much greater" than using foreign bases.
    A reporter asked whether it was possible to reduce European troops. Dulles said that the United States stated when signing the Paris Agreement in 1954 that American policy was to maintain armed forces in Europe, and the United States now "has absolutely no intention of violating this policy statement." He also said that all NATO member states should provide the troops stipulated by the Allied Command Europe and the committee that stipulates the number of troops there. The obligation of West Germany to build twelve divisions, which has already been agreed upon, should be fulfilled unless NATO takes joint action to make some changes.

    杜勒斯承认世界人民要求裁军
    但还是重复美国军事政策依赖“威慑力量”的滥调
    据新华社19日讯　华盛顿消息：美国国务卿杜勒斯在七月十八日举行的记者招待会上说，看来，全世界有着一种倾向，这就是要求裁减武装部队。不过他解释说，这种倾向是由于人们认识到现代武器的发展使得人力“不像以前那样着重”而产生的。
    他说，美国军事政策的一般概念是“主要依赖有选择的威慑力量”。在谈这个问题的时候，他拒绝回答他本人是否赞成裁减美国的武装部队。杜勒斯说，除了报纸上的消息以外，他没有听到过美国参谋长联席会议主席雷德福建议到1960年把美国武装部队裁减八十万人这回事。不过他说，他不怀疑五角大楼正在讨论裁减美国武装部队的问题。
    杜勒斯说，如果军界人士从他们的观点提出裁减人力的建议，那么他从政治观点方面提不出什么理由反对这样作。不过，他认为，尽管裁减人员的趋势也许会多少继续下去，美国在核子武器方面一定要对苏联保持“优势”。他认为这一点是“极为重要的”不允许“在这方面有任何特别的裁减”。
    在回答由于中立主义情绪增长和新武器的发展，美国有没有可能逐渐撤除它的海外基地的问题的时候，杜勒斯说，用美国大陆作基地来采取“报复”行动所需要的费用比用外国的基地“大得多”。
    有记者问到欧洲部队是否有可能裁减。杜勒斯说，美国在1954年签订巴黎协定的时候就声明过，美国的政策是要在欧洲维持武装部队，美国现在“根本没有违背这个政策声明的打算”。他还说，所有北大西洋成员国应该提供欧洲盟军司令部和在那里规定军队人数的委员会所规定的军队。已经商定好的西德建军十二个师的义务，除非北大西洋公约组织共同采取行动，作某些改变，否则就应该履行。
