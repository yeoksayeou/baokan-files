    Half Vest
    In June, the workers' representatives of the Dongkou Manganese Mine in Hunan bought a batch of undershirts at the Dongkou County Department Store, including a dozen of the "Hua Fu" brand. The colors of these vests, red, yellow, blue, and green, were not unattractive, and the price was not low, at 1.54 yuan per piece. But after washing them in water, they were a disaster: the original width of 90 cm became 150 cm, while the length shrank by a third. Short and wide, when worn, half the stomach is exposed, and the wind blows it back and forth like a bath towel. People call it the "half vest." May I ask, how are people supposed to wear this kind of vest!

    半截背心
    六月间，我们湖南洞口锰矿代职工在洞口县百货公司买了一批汗背心，其中一打是华福牌的。这打背心的颜色，有红、黄、蓝、绿四种，不算难看，价钱也不算低，每件一元五角四分。可是经水一洗，就不像话了：原来宽90公分变成了150公分，长度却缩短了三分之一，又短又宽，穿在身上半截肚皮露在外面，风吹来，飘飘荡荡，像披一条浴巾。人们都叫它“半截背心”。请问，这种背心叫人怎么穿呢！
