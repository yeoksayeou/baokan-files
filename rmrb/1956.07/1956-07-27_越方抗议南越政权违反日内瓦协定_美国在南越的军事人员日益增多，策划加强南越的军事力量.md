    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 25th - The General Headquarters of the Vietnam People's Army stated that the number of U.S. military personnel in South Vietnam is increasing daily. In March of this year, the United States added another 100 military personnel to the U.S. military training delegation in South Vietnam; in May and June, another 320 U.S. military personnel entered South Vietnam. Before March, there were already 1,300 U.S. and Philippine military personnel in South Vietnam.
    This is a fact pointed out by the liaison delegation of the General Headquarters of the Vietnam People's Army in a letter to the International Commission of Vietnam on July 9th. The letter stated that since March of this year, the South Vietnamese regime's violations of the military terms of the Geneva Accords have become increasingly serious.

    The letter also pointed out that many U.S. military aircraft and weapons have been transported into South Vietnam. A total of 45 military aircraft were transported in the four months from March to June. These aircraft were not subject to any inspection by the International Commission. In March, the South Vietnamese regime also illegally transported two ships of weapons and military supplies. In the four months from March to June, the South Vietnamese regime transported a total of 23 landing craft and 32 armored motorboats. These are used to equip the South Vietnamese army.

    越方抗议南越政权违反日内瓦协定
    美国在南越的军事人员日益增多，策划加强南越的军事力量
    新华社河内25日电　越南人民军总司令部说，美国在南越的军事人员日益增多。今年三月份，美国又把一百名军事人员补充到美国在南越的军事训练代表团；五、六月中，又有三百二十名美国军事人员进入南越。而在三月份以前，在南越的美国和菲律宾军事人员就已经有一千三百人。
    这是越南人民军总司令部联络代表团在七月九日给越南国际委员会的一封信里指出的事实。这封信说，从今年三月份起，南越政权违反日内瓦协定军事条款的行为越来越严重了。
    今天公布的这封信说，美国的军事人员主持南越的各种军事活动，视察在同塔梅和西宁地区同各教派作战的南越军队，以及各军事训练学校和飞机场、军港等。
    许多美国高级军事人员也不断到南越去，督促和策划加强南越的军事力量。
    这封信还指出，有许多美国的军用飞机和武器运进南越。在今年三月到六月的四个月中又共运进四十五架军用飞机。这些飞机没有受到国际委员会的任何检查。三月份内，南越政权还非法运入两船武器和军事物资，在三月到六月的四个月中，南越政权一共运入二十三只登陆艇和三十二只装甲汽艇。这些都是用来装备南越军队的。
    越南人民军联络代表团指出，南越政权和美国继续在进行实际上的军事联盟的活动。南越政权还不断地阻挠国际委员会的活动。
    越南人民军总司令部联络代表团对南越政权的各种违反日内瓦协定的行为表示抗议，要求国际委员会对南越政权上述行动进行调查，并且要求国际委员会把南越的这些违反协定的行为报告日内瓦会议的两位主席。
