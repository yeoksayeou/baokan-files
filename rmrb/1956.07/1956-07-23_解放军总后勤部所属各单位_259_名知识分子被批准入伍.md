    解放军总后勤部所属各单位   
    259名知识分子被批准入伍
    本报讯　中国人民解放军总后勤部所属各单位最近有259名知识分子被批准入伍。这些人中包括各军医院校和工程建筑系统的教授、副教授、讲师、主治医生和工程师等115名高级知识分子。评为尉级或校级军官的军衔，已经由国防部批准授予。
    这些被批准入伍的知识分子，几年来在我军现代化正规化建设的不同岗位上，对国防建设事业贡献出不少力量；他们在工作中不断提高了思想觉悟和业务能力，并表示了愿意长期为军队建设服务的决心。总后勤部营管部于七月十四日召开了知识分子入伍授衔大会，当领导上宣布三十三名知识分子的入伍申请已被批准以后，全场立即响起了热烈的掌声。在大会以后召开的座谈会上，有十九人发言表示，一定要加倍努力工作，爱护国家给予他们的荣誉。工程师周心恺向大家提出倡议，保证今后要积极钻研业务，努力学习军事科学，全面地发展自己。有的知识分子被批准入伍以后，全家人都像过节日一样为他祝贺；有的孩子第一次看到他的父亲穿上军装，愉快地说：“过去我喊别人解放军叔叔，现在我有了解放军爸爸了。”（吕文烈、徐圣渔）
