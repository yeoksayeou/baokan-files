    So Many Township Cadres
    Anyone who comes to Yanqiao Township in the Eastern Suburban District of Shanghai will be surprised by the large number of cadres in this township. The township itself has 31 cadres, and recently the higher authorities are going to transfer two more. There are already six cadres stationed in this township by various departments at the higher level, and recently one more will be sent, adding up to exactly forty. Is the population of this township particularly large? No, there are only 1,700 households. Is the area of this township particularly large? No, the diameter of the entire township is only three kilometers. Is the work of this township particularly complicated? No, it is just simple rural work, with no towns, shops, factories or schools. As a result, there are too many people, but not too much work. What should be done? Many cadres have nothing to do and spend a lot of time reading newspapers and comic books.
    Why is it that today, when cooperatives need a large number of leading personnel, so many cadres are piled up in this township without some being sent down?

    好多的乡干部
    谁要来到上海市东郊区严家桥乡，谁就要对这个乡里的干部之多发生惊讶。这个乡本身的干部有三十一名，最近上级还要调来两名，上面各部门派驻这个乡的干部本来已有六名，最近还要派来一名，加在一起，不多不少四十名。是这个乡的人口特别多吗？不，只有一千七百户。是这个乡的范围特别大吗？不，全乡直径只有三公里。是这个乡的工作特别复杂吗？不，只是单纯的农村工作，既无市镇商店，也无工厂学校。结果，人太多，事却不太多，怎么办呢？不少干部只得无所事事，就用不少时间去看报纸和小人书了。
    为什么在合作社需要大批领导骨干的今天，这个乡却堆了这么多的干部而不放下去一些呢？
