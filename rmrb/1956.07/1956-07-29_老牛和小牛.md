    Old Ox and Calf
    In the early summer noon, the sun was annoyingly hot. At the livestock market in Xiazhuang Village, Gaomi County, an old man named Zhang, in his fifties, anxiously shouted, leading two oxen: "Who wants them! Fifteen yuan for the pair, seventeen yuan for the old ox alone!" These two oxen, one old and one young, the old ox with sparse teeth and smooth horns, drooping eyelids, chewing on fodder weakly. The calf, however, had thick legs and a large dewlap, soft fetal hair, and bright eyes, very lovable.
    Responding to Zhang’s call, several people came forward to ask the price, but all wanted to buy only the old ox, not the calf. They offered fifteen yuan for the old ox alone, but were unwilling to take the calf. Old man Zhang repeatedly shook his head: "The calf can't leave the old ox yet, not selling it!". Although the old man said he wouldn't sell, he was actually anxious, because the cattle feed was running out.
      As the day passed noon, and people were about to leave the market, under the "mobilization" and persuasion of the trader, Old Man Zhang finally agreed to sell the old ox alone for sixteen yuan. After the money and ox were exchanged, the buyer contentedly led the old ox south. Old Man Zhang, with tears in his eyes, hugged the calf that was mooing sadly, muttering in a low voice: "It's not even worth a chicken! Not even worth a chicken!" The old ox walked further and further away, the calf cried more and more mournfully, and Old Man Zhang's tears turned into a string. When the old ox entered the crowd and was about to disappear, Old Man Zhang suddenly stood up and punched the calf's butt hard: "Go to your mother!" The calf obediently went through the crowd straight to its "mother." Old Man Zhang strode away, relieved, through the north gate of Xiazhuang Village.
    The fact that no one wants calves is not an isolated phenomenon in the Jiaodong area. What impact will the development of this abnormal phenomenon have on the development of production?
    Everyone knows that under the current conditions in our country, oxen are still a very important productive force, but cattle also grow from small to large! Without calves, where do the big oxen come from? No one wants to raise calves, everyone wants to use "ready-made" ones, who will raise the calves?
    Now, many areas have achieved collectivization, and if the cooperatives do the same, it will only fuel the development of this abnormal phenomenon. I think that cooperatives, as advanced production organizations, should not only consider immediate interests and ignore long-term interests, only calculate small accounts and not large accounts. In addition, the leading organs should also pay attention to helping farmers solve the difficulties of raising calves. It is hoped that this abnormal phenomenon can be quickly changed.　(Mu Li)

    老牛和小牛
    初夏的中午，太阳晒得人心烦。在高密县夏庄村集日的牲畜市里，一位五十多岁的张老大爷牵着两个牛焦急地喊着：“谁要！买一对十五元，光要老牛十七元”。这两个牛，一老一小，老牛齿稀角滑，搭拉着眼皮，有气无力地嚼着刍草。小牛犊却是粗腿大嗉，柔软的胎毛，明朗的眼睛，十分可爱。
    应着张大爷叫声，上前问价的也有几个人，但都是只买老牛，不要小牛。光买老牛价钱出十五元；带小牛就不愿意要。张老大爷连连摇头：“小牛还不能离开老牛，不卖！”。老大爷嘴说不卖，实际心里着急，因为牛草已经快没有了。
      日已过午，人将散市，张大爷在交易员的“动员”说服下，终于答应十六元钱光卖了老牛。钱牛两交后，买牛人心满意足的牵着老牛向南走去，张大爷眼噙着泪水抱着哞哞哀叫的小牛，低声咕哝着：“就不如一只鸡！就不如一只鸡！”。老牛越走越远，小牛愈叫愈哀，张大爷的泪水也连成了串。当老牛进入人群快要看不见了的时候，张大爷猛地站起来，狠狠地在小牛犊的屁股上揍了一拳：“去你娘的吧！”小牛乖乖地穿过人群直奔它“老娘”而去。张大爷三步两脚，如释重负地走出了夏庄村的北门。
    小牛没人要，在胶东地区并不是个别的现象。这种不正常的现象发展下去，对生产的发展会发生些什么影响呢？
    谁都知道，在我国当前条件下，耕牛还是相当重要的生产动力，可是，牛也是由小到大生长起来的呵！没有小牛，何来大牛？谁也不愿养小牛，谁也想用“现成”的，小牛又靠谁来成长呢？
    现在，许多地区已经实现了合作化，合作社也这样干，就更助长了这种不正常现象的发展。我觉得合作社既是先进的生产组织，就不能只顾眼前利益不顾长远利益，只算小账，不算大账。另外，领导机关也应该注意帮助农民解决饲养小牛的困难。希望这种不正常的现象能迅速有所改变。　（木犁）
