Who Exactly Has "Personal Emotions"?
　　Guo Yi
　　Young technicians Chen Yuguang and Zhi Lianrui of the coking workshop of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant have a problem because they have been labeled as "undisciplined," "opposing the Party," and other serious accusations.
　　The situation is as follows: In January of this year, the coking workshop began to select advanced producers. Dong Jilai, the chairman of the workshop's trade union, asked Chen Yuguang and Zhi Lianrui to compile materials for technician Dai Honglin, preparing to nominate him as a candidate for advanced producer. Dai Honglin had been promoted to technician for less than a year and had not yet made any outstanding achievements in his work. Therefore, Chen Yuguang and Zhi Lianrui disagreed with nominating Dai Honglin as an advanced producer. They sought the opinions of other comrades, who shared the same view, and reported this situation to Dong Jilai. However, Dong Jilai did not consider the opinions of the masses. At the general meeting of all union members in the workshop office for electing advanced producers, he still insisted on nominating Dai Honglin as a candidate and criticized those who raised objections for having "personal emotions," exclaiming excitedly, "The evaluation work has been discussed and studied by the Party branch. Is there anyone here who is more capable than the Party branch?" Despite Dong Jilai's assertion that no one was more capable than the Party branch, many people still stood up and expressed different opinions, and Dai Honglin was not elected as an advanced producer.
　　One would expect that even if trade union chairman Dong Jilai still did not recognize his mistake at this point, the Party organization should have been clear-headed. However, the Party branch of this unit was not like that. Zhao Yaohua, the propaganda committee member of the Party branch, summoned these young technicians for a discussion. He actually said, "You went to solicit the opinions of the masses on the evaluation work without going through the organization. What kind of behavior is this? You even had outlines in your hands when you spoke at the meeting. Isn't this planned? Aren't you consciously opposing the Party? Think about it yourselves, isn't this actually a small-group activity?"
　　Here, without dwelling on how these young technicians answered these questions, let us also raise a few questions to this propaganda committee member and the trade union chairman: Is the advanced producer supposed to be selected by the masses or decided by the trade union? Is the Party organization "superior" because it is good at listening to the opinions of the masses, or because it is good at labeling those who raise objections with various "hats"? When did our Party stipulate that the masses are not allowed to have outlines when they express opinions to leaders, are not allowed to prepare in advance, and are not allowed to exchange opinions with others? If these restrictive rules were not established by the Party but were created by yourselves, then who exactly is opposing the Party, undisciplined, and has personal emotions?

    到底谁有“个人情绪”
    郭仪
    石景山钢铁厂炼焦车间的青年技术员陈煜光、智联瑞等有一个苦恼，因为他们被戴上了“无组织无纪律”、“和党闹对立”……的大帽子。
    事情是这样的：今年一月，炼焦车间开始评选先进生产者。车间工会主席董吉来要陈煜光、智联瑞整理技术员戴洪林的材料，准备让他作为先进生产者候选人。戴洪林被提拔为技术员不到一年，工作还没有作出突出的成绩。因此，陈煜光和智联瑞不同意戴洪林作先进生产者，他们就去征求其他同志的意见，大家也有同样的看法，于是就向董吉来汇报了这一情况。可是，董吉来没有考虑群众的意见，在选举先进生产者的车间办公室全体工人会员大会上，他还要戴洪林作先进生产者候选人，而且批评提意见的人是有“个人情绪”并激动地宣称：“评宣工作是经过党总支讨论和研究过的，难道你们还有谁能比党总支更高明吗？”尽管董吉来宣称没有人会比党总支更高明，可是，很多人还是起来发表了不同的意见，戴洪林还是没有被选举为先进生产者。
    按说，到这时候，即使工会主席董吉来仍然没有认识到自己的错误，党组织头脑应该是清醒的。可是，这个单位的党总支却不是这样。党总支的宣传委员赵耀华却把这几个青年技术员找来谈话了。他居然说道：“你们不经过组织擅自去征求群众对评选工作的意见，这算什么行为？你们大会发言手里还拿提纲，你们这不是有准备的？不是有意识地来和党闹对立？你们自己想想，实际上这是不是小组织活动？”
    这里，姑且不管这些青年技术员怎样回答这些问题，让我们也来向这位宣传委员以及工会主席提出几个问题：先进生产者究竟是让群众来评选呢还是由工会来研究决定？党组织所以“高明”，究竟是因为它善于听取群众的意见，还是因为善于给提意见者戴这样那样的“帽子”？我们党又什么时候规定过群众对领导提意见的时候发言不能有提纲、事先不能有准备，也不许和别人交换意见？如果这些清规戒律不是党立下的，而是你们自己制造出来的，那么和党闹对立、无组织无纪律、以及有个人情绪的倒底是谁？
