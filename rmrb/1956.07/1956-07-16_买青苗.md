    Buying Green Crops
    Sha Ou
    In recent years, the practice of "buying green crops" has become very prevalent in literary and art circles. Publishers are sending "commissioning contracts" flying everywhere, and along with these contracts, young authors receive hundred-yuan or fifty-yuan advances. The accompanying letters are also very earnest, insisting that the author sign the contract, that the author accept the hundred or fifty yuan, and that the author sell their green crops to the publisher.
    I am not at all suggesting that publishers should not establish close ties with young authors, and even signing "commissioning contracts" can have its benefits. The problem lies with the hundred or fifty yuan.
    Since those who insist on signing "commissioning contracts" are made to accept this money, it means that buying the green crops is a done deal. With the green crops secured, the publisher can sit back and relax, confident in completing their publishing plan on schedule.
    Unfortunately, things often don't go as planned.
    Those who buy green crops rarely consider that there are "selling air" types who don't actually have the confidence to write a work, but are attracted by the hundred or fifty yuan, and boldly "sell air." Moreover, there isn't just one publisher, nor just one hundred or fifty yuan, nor just one "commissioning contract," so "selling air" happens more than once.
    This is very bad. Because the green crops have already been sold, but the seedlings are nowhere to be seen, they have to rush the production. This hurried production results in the quality of the work being far from guaranteed. The China Juvenile and Children's Publishing House has had such examples, where the manuscript arrived and was very poor, but because a deposit had already been paid, they couldn't simply reject it, nor could they force its publication, so they could only suffer in silence.
    The impact doesn't stop there! If publishers send money around too easily, it could become a trend. For publishers, this would simplify the complex, detailed, and arduous editorial work into merely writing checks; and especially for young authors, using money to attract their creativity could have unimaginable consequences.
    As for the competition and quarrels between publishers caused by buying green crops, these are also frequently heard of.
    Clearly, this is not a good method.

    买青苗
    沙鸥
    近年来，文艺界买青苗之风很盛。出版社的“约稿合同”满天飞，随着“约稿合同”到达青年作者手中的，则是百元或五十元现款。附的信也是十分恳切，一定要作者签合同，一定要作者收下这百元或五十元，一定要把青苗卖给出版社。
    我丝毫不是说出版社不应该同青年作者建立密切联系，就是签签“约稿合同”，也是有好处的。问题在于这百元或五十元的身上。
    既然硬要签“约稿合同”的人收下这笔钱，就是说买青苗是买定了。青苗既定，出版社就可以稳坐钓鱼台，按期完成发稿计划了。
    可惜常常是事与愿违的。
    买青苗的人很难想到，就有这样“卖空”的人，他其实并没有把握写出作品来，但是，百元或五十元对他也颇为吸引，就大胆“卖空”了。而且，出版社不只一个，百元或五十元也不止一笔，“约稿合同”也不只一张，于是“卖空”也不止一次了。
    这就很糟了。因为青苗既然已卖出去，而苗还没有影子，只好赶制。这样加快赶制的结果，作品的质量就丝毫也谈不上保证。中国少年儿童出版社就有这样的例子，稿子来了，很不好，但是，这又是早就付了定金的，既不便简单地退掉，又不能勉强出版，只得暗暗叫苦。
    影响还不止此！如果出版社把钱很轻易地送来送去，就有可能成为一种风气。对出版社说来，这就会把复杂、细致、艰苦的编辑工作简单化为开开支票就行了；特别是对青年作者说来，用钱去吸引他们创作，后果是不堪设想的。
    至于出版社之间因买青苗而引起的竞争、争吵，也时有所闻了。
    显然，这不是一个好办法。
