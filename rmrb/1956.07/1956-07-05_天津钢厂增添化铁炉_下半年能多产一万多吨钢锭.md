Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: The iron smelting furnace added to the Tianjin Steel Plant this year has been completed. On June 28th, steelworkers poured the first batch of molten iron into the open-hearth furnace, and the first batch of steel produced took 32 minutes less than planned to smelt.

    70% of the raw materials used in each batch of steel produced by the Tianjin Steel Plant is pig iron. In the past, pig iron blocks were directly added to the open-hearth furnace to be melted into molten iron before steelmaking, which was a lengthy smelting process. Now, the pig iron blocks can be melted into molten iron in advance using the iron smelting furnace, and then added to the open-hearth furnace for steelmaking, thus greatly shortening the smelting time.

    According to preliminary calculations by the Tianjin Steel Plant, with the addition of the iron smelting furnace, the plant will be able to produce more than 10,000 tons more steel ingots in the second half of this year than in the first half.

    天津钢厂增添化铁炉
    下半年能多产一万多吨钢锭
    据新华社讯　天津钢厂今年增添的化铁炉已经建成。六月二十八日炼钢工人第一次把化好的铁水送进了炼钢平炉，炼出的第一炉钢冶炼时间比计划缩短了三十二分钟。
    天津钢厂每炼一炉钢所采用的原料，有70％是生铁。过去都是把生铁块直接加到平炉中先化成铁水以后再炼钢，冶炼过程很长；现在，可以事先用化铁炉把生铁块化成铁水，然后加到平炉中炼钢，因而冶炼时间大大缩短。
    根据天津钢厂初步计算的结果，由于增添了化铁炉，这个厂在今年下半年能比上半年多产一万多吨钢锭。
