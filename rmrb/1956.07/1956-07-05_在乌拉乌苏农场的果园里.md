    In the orchard of the Ula Usu Farm, the green trees provide ample shade. Grapes emit an enticing fragrance, and peach and apple trees bear lovely fruit.

    Last October, Comrade Dong Biwu inspected this farm. The male and female soldiers working in the orchard invited this relative who had come from the capital to taste the fresh peaches newly picked from the orchard. This year, even more peaches have grown. When the farm's soldier, Huai Junjie, collected fruit tree seeds from afar and planted them in the ground, he once wondered: when will we be able to eat fruit? Only five years later, he tasted the flavor of honey peaches. The orchard he manages now has even more varieties of fruit trees. When the young women Yue Shulan, Sun Shuzhi, and Wang Huandong first arrived at this farm from Rongcheng County, Shandong, in late autumn and early winter, they were surprised to see the soldiers burying the grapevines in the ground and asked the instructor, "Why bury them underground?" The instructor replied, "When it gets cold, we all have to wear cotton clothes, and grapes in this place also have to wear cotton clothes!" At that time, they did not know how to cultivate fruit trees. Xie Zhengya, who came from the Southwest Agricultural College, lived with them, and she patiently told them what she had learned at school. Today, these young women have all become skilled fruit tree cultivators.

    在乌拉乌苏农场的果园里
    乌拉乌苏农场的果园里，绿林成荫。葡萄发出诱人的芳香，桃树、苹果树结了可爱的果实。
    去年十月，董必武同志视察这座农场，在果园生产的男女战士们，请从首都远道而来的亲人，尝了新从果园里摘下的鲜桃。今年，桃结得更多了。当农场的战士槐俊杰，从老远的地方，搜集来果木的种子，种到地里时，他曾经想：要到什么时候才能吃上水果呢？仅仅隔了五年，他就尝到了蜜桃的滋味。他经营过的果园，果树的品种更多了。当年轻的姑娘岳淑兰、孙淑芝、王焕东在秋末冬初从山东荣成县初到这座农场的时候，看到战士们把葡萄藤埋在地里，惊奇地问指导员：“为什么要埋在地下呢？”指导员回答说：“天冷了，我们都要穿棉衣，葡萄在这个地方，也得穿棉衣哩！”那时候，她们还不知道怎样栽培果树。从西南农学院来的谢征亚，同她们生活在一起，她把在学校里学到的东西，耐心地告诉了她们。今天，这几位姑娘都已经成为栽培果树的能手了。
