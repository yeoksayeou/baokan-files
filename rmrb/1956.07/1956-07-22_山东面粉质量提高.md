    Since January of this year, the product quality of grain processing factories in Shandong Province has improved greatly. Qingdao Joint State-Private Shuangfu Flour Mill has strengthened its work on the fine selection of raw grains and finished product testing. Since the first quarter, it has basically overcome shortcomings such as high ash content, coarse fineness, and poor color in its products. Qingdao State-Owned No. 2 Flour Mill implemented the operating method of "separating the fine from the bran beforehand, separate milling and screening," and increased the brushing of the bran in the middle and tail sections, increasing the quality pass rate from 84% in the fourth quarter of last year to over 88%. Weifang Joint State-Private Dalai Flour Mill adopted the "five diligences" operating method of diligently scraping the sieve bottom and diligently watching the windmill, as well as a patrol operation method. From January to April this year, the average monthly quality pass rate increased from 89% to over 95%.

    山东面粉质量提高
    本报讯　从今年一月以来，山东省各地粮食加工厂的产品质量已有很大改进。青岛市公私合营双蚨面粉厂，加强了对原粮的精选、成品化验等工作，从第一季度起基本上克服了产品灰粉大、精度粗、色泽次等缺点。国营青岛市第二面粉厂实行了“精渣前提、分磨分筛”操作方法，并且增加了中路和尾路的刷麸后，使质量合格率由去年第四季度的84％提高到88％以上。潍坊市公私合营大莱面粉厂在生产中采用了勤刮筛底，勤看风车等五勤操作法和巡回作业法后，今年一月到四月份，每月平均质量合格率由89％提高到95％以上。
