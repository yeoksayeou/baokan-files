    Exert All Efforts to Fight Against Rain and Floods:
    Henan Completes the Rush Harvest and Threshing of 72.89 Million Mu of Wheat
    (Our dispatch) Zhengzhou -- Henan Province has basically completed the rush harvest and threshing of 72.89 million mu of wheat. As of June 30th, 60% of the wheat had been threshed once, and 30% had been threshed twice. Although the province's wheat suffered damage from rain and floods this year, the yield is still higher than last year.
    Entering June, the province experienced continuous rainfall. In order to prevent the wheat from mildewing and sprouting, farmers in various counties braved the rain and waded through water to launch a rush harvest and threshing campaign. For the wet wheat salvaged from the mud and floods, farmers came up with various methods to grind and thresh. The Chengguan Agricultural Production Cooperative in Yancheng County chopped off the wheat ears, dried them with fire, and then knocked them to thresh. A common practice was to mobilize all cooperative members to thresh and rub the ears day and night, which proved to be very effective.
    While the farmers were urgently engaged in rushing to harvest and thresh, Party and government leading organs at all levels in Henan Province organized delegations to brave the rain and visit disaster-stricken areas for relief and condolences. The local troops, government cadres, school teachers and students, etc., all braved the rain to help farmers with the rush harvest; the health departments organized medical teams to provide farmers with epidemic prevention and treatment; the supply and marketing cooperatives also sent mobile sales teams to sell goods in the wheat fields and threshing grounds. Thanks to the strong support from all sides, the victory of the province's farmers in the fight against the disaster was ensured. (Wang Changlong)

    全力向阴雨和洪水作斗争
    河南7，289万亩小麦抢收抢打完毕
    本报讯　河南省7，289万亩小麦抢收抢打工作已经基本结束，截至六月三十日止，已有60％小麦打过头遍，30％小麦打过二遍。今年全省小麦虽然遭了雨水和洪水的损害，但仍比去年增产。
    进入六月，全省连续阴雨，为了不使小麦发霉发芽，各县农民冒雨、趟水展开了抢收抢打运动。从泥浆和洪水中抢收回来的湿麦，农民想出了多种多样的办法来碾打脱粒。郾城县城关农业生产合作社把麦穗铡下来，用火烘干，再敲打脱粒。普遍的作法是发动全体社员日夜摔打、搓穗，效果很好。
    农民紧急抢收抢打的时候，河南省各级党政领导机关组织了代表团，冒雨到受灾严重的地区进行救济和慰问。各地的驻军、机关干部、学校师生等都冒雨帮助农民抢收；卫生部门组织了医疗组，巡回给农民防疫、诊病；供销社也派出流动推销小组到麦地、场边卖货。由于各方面的有力支援，保证了全省农民抗灾斗争的胜利。　（王昌隆）
