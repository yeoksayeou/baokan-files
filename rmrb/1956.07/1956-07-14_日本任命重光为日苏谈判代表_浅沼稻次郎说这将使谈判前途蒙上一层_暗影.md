Xinhua News Agency, July 13th, Tokyo dispatch: The Japanese government today formally appointed Foreign Minister Mamoru Shigemitsu as the chief plenipotentiary representative for the normalization of diplomatic relations between Japan and the Soviet Union. Shigemitsu has accepted the appointment.

Matsumoto Shunichi, the former chief plenipotentiary representative who negotiated in London, has been appointed as a plenipotentiary representative to assist Shigemitsu in the upcoming resumption of Japanese-Soviet negotiations. Today's cabinet meeting also tentatively decided that the location for the resumption of negotiations would be Moscow, and that this would be finalized by Shigemitsu in consultation with the Soviet side.

Shigemitsu Kio is known for advocating a "cautious" approach to the normalization of Japanese-Soviet relations. His appointment this time was decided after several days of contention within the ruling Liberal Democratic Party regarding the selection of the chief plenipotentiary representative. News reports indicate that Prime Minister Ichiro Hatoyama and Agriculture and Forestry Minister Ichiro Kono initially advocated for appointing Shigemasa Sunada (former Director-General of the Defense Agency) of the Hatoyama faction as the chief plenipotentiary representative, but this was unsuccessful due to opposition from others within the party. Later, Hatoyama intended to appoint Naotake Satō (who served as the Japanese ambassador to the Soviet Union during the war) of the Green Wind Society, another conservative party faction, to the position of chief plenipotentiary representative, but this also met with strong opposition within the party.

Secretary-General of the Japan Socialist Party, Inejirō Asanuma, said today that the Hatoyama government's appointment of Shigemitsu as chief plenipotentiary representative would cast a "shadow" over the prospects of negotiations. He said that Shigemitsu's appointment would raise many serious problems because he has consistently obstructed the government's efforts to promote the restoration of peaceful relations with the Soviet Union.

### 日本任命重光为日苏谈判代表  浅沼稻次郎说这将使谈判前途蒙上一层“暗影”

    日本任命重光为日苏谈判代表
    浅沼稻次郎说这将使谈判前途蒙上一层“暗影”
    新华社13日讯　东京消息：日本政府今天正式任命外务相重光葵为日苏两国外交关系正常化谈判的首席全权代表。重光已经接受了任命。
    曾经在伦敦谈判的日本首席全权代表松本俊一被任命为全权代表，在行将恢复的日苏谈判中协助重光。今天的内阁会议还初步决定恢复谈判的地点在莫斯科，并且要由重光同苏联方面联系以后最后确定。
    重光葵一向以主张在对日苏关系正常化问题采取“慎重”态度著称。他这次被任命是执政的自由民主党内部就首席全权代表人选问题争执了几天以后才决定的。消息报道，首相鸠山一郎和农林相河野一郎等人最初曾经主张让鸠山派的砂田重政（前防卫厅长官）担任首席全权代表，但遭到党内另一些人的反对而未能成功。后来，鸠山又打算任命另一个保守党派绿风会的佐藤尚武（战时曾任日本驻苏联大使）担任首席全权代表职务，但是也遭到党内的强烈反对。
    日本社会党总书记浅沼稻次郎今天说：鸠山政府任命重光担任首席全权代表将使谈判前途蒙上一层“暗影”。他说，重光的任命会引起很多严重的问题，因为他一贯阻碍政府关于促使同苏联恢复和平关系的努力。
