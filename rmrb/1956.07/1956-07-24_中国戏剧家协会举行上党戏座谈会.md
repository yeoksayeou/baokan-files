The China Theatre Association held a座谈会 on July 21st for the Shangdang Opera Performance Troupe from Changzhi Prefecture, Shanxi Province, who were in Beijing to give report-back performances of "Shangdang Bangzi and Shangdang Lezi." Writer Zhao Shuli, with a warm tone of loving his local opera, introduced the characteristics of Shangdang Opera. Liu Zhiming, Deputy Minister of Culture, and theatrical figures such as Li Gang and Liu Naichong, when discussing their impressions, analyzed the characteristics of Shangdang Opera, such as the simplicity and boldness of the performance style, the high-pitched and passionate singing, and the strong spirit of people's struggle preserved in the scripts. They expressed hope that the troupe would maintain and promote these inherent characteristics, make efforts to explore and整理 traditional repertoire, especially their own unique repertoire, and pay attention to cultivating the next generation, so that this distinctive local opera genre can develop and flourish even better.

Shangdang Opera is a local opera that is popular in the Taihang Mountain area in southeastern Shanxi Province. It has been influenced by Qin腔, Kunqu Opera, and Pi Huang, but its local characteristics are extremely distinct. There are many repertoires in Shangdang Opera that other opera genres do not have; there are also some repertoires with the same themes as other opera genres, but the content is very different.

    中国戏剧家协会举行上党戏座谈会
    本报讯　中国戏剧家协会在七月二十一日为山西省长治专区赴京汇报演出团举行了“上党梆子、上党乐子”座谈会。作家赵树理以热爱家乡戏的亲切语调介绍了上党戏的特点。文化部副部长刘芝明、戏剧界人士李刚、刘乃崇等在谈自己的观感时，对上党戏的特点，如表演风格的朴实、豪放，唱腔的高吭、激越，剧本里所保存的强烈的人民斗争精神等等作了分析，希望剧团保持、发扬这些固有特点，努力发掘整理传统剧目，特别是自己特有的剧目，注意培养下一代，以使这个富有特色的地方剧种能够更好地发展和繁荣起来。
    上党戏是流传于山西省东南部太行山区的地方戏。它接受过秦腔、昆曲、皮黄等剧种的影响，但地方色彩极为鲜明。上党戏中有很多剧目是其他剧种所没有的；还有一些题材虽和其他剧种相同，但内容却大有差异的剧目。
