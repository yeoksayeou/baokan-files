    Secretary of the State Party Committee
    Just arrived in Leningrad, the comrades from "Pravda" informed us that the Secretary of the State Party Committee would meet with us tomorrow. I thought that such a responsible comrade meeting with us would probably only provide a general introduction to the work of the Leningrad State Party Committee. As reporters, hoping to find fresh and vivid material, I probably shouldn't have high expectations for this meeting.
    Unexpectedly, the next morning, while sitting in the car, the comrade from "Pravda" casually told us: the Secretary of the State Party Committee we are about to meet is a "famous production innovator"; he has put forward many rationalization proposals. He modernized an old machine tool—a hexagonal lathe—to process very complex parts, for which he even obtained a candidate doctoral degree.
    This was truly unexpected and fresh news. The Secretary of the State Party Committee actually understands technology! Moreover, not just generally understands, but can also achieve something in scientific research!
    We walked into the office of this Secretary of the State Party Committee with great interest. The host came to greet us and shook hands warmly. The "Pravda" comrade introduced us: "This is Comrade Mitrofanov."
    This Secretary of the State Party Committee has a pair of blue eyes that blink frequently, and is much younger than we imagined. He heard that we were very interested in knowing about his deeds as a production innovator, so he sat down and briefly introduced his experience to us.
    He is only thirty-eight years old this year. Five years ago, he was still working as the chief production engineer in a factory. He started doing Party work in 1951. Initially, he was the secretary of the district Party committee, then he became the secretary of the municipal Party committee, and now he has been the secretary of the state Party committee for almost a year.
    He studied mechanical manufacturing. In 1953, he developed a "group processing" method. Applying this method to old-fashioned hexagonal lathes can increase efficiency by 40%-70%, and shorten the time for adjusting the lathe by 50%-60%. Using this method on other machine tools can also improve efficiency and shorten auxiliary time. This method is not only of great significance for modernizing old equipment, but also provides important new ideas for designing new machine tools in the future. Now, this method he has developed has been adopted by many factories throughout the Soviet Union.
    The research work is still ongoing. Now Comrade Mitrofanov is writing a book, giving a further detailed discussion of the group processing method. At the same time, new research work—writing a doctoral dissertation—has already begun.
    What a persevering person, and what a special Party worker!
    Perhaps he misunderstood our surprised expressions, and quickly added:
    "Of course, my main work is still Party work. These scientific research work can only be done in my spare time. For example, after nine o'clock in the evening, taking a little less rest on holidays, getting up earlier in the summer, I can squeeze out time. Sometimes when I get carried away, I don't sleep until one or two o'clock in the morning." He said with a smile: "The Russian saying goes, more rest is always better than more work; people always have inertia, and it mainly depends on themselves to seize the time."
    "Naturally, research work cannot be considered Party work," he continued. "But this is related to Party work. Because I am responsible for leading industry, I should be an expert in industrial matters. Party organizations must lead enterprises to continuously study and adopt new technologies, and Party workers themselves should understand what new technologies are. Only in this way can we go to factories and put forward suggestions that are truly helpful to the factory, and only then can we talk about specific leadership. Our Soviet Party workers are all familiar with professional knowledge. The second secretary of the state Party committee, Comrade Brezhnev, is responsible for leading agriculture, and he is a doctor of agriculture. Last year, he wrote a very thick book on improving tomato varieties and increasing tomato production."
    We thought that a Secretary of the State Party Committee must be very busy with his work. He has to attend various meetings, review documents, and probably doesn't spend much time going down to factories. Therefore, we did not directly use the words "go deep among the masses," but carefully and indirectly asked: "Your work is very busy, but can you also spare some time to go to the factory?"
    He looked at us and smiled.
    The answer was again beyond our expectations: "I go to the factory almost every day," he said. "Talking with workers and technicians in the factory, understanding the production situation, and jointly studying with them what measures to take to improve production, this is our daily work, this is what we do." It seems that this secretary understands that reporters are most interested in "concrete" things. He paused, and then continued: "For example, yesterday, I went to the Kirov factory. A production innovator there, Comrade Karashov, invented a new milling cutter with very high efficiency. I went to the factory and had a small meeting with Comrade Karashov, the factory director, and scientific researchers. We decided to manufacture a batch of this new tool in our factory first, and then test it. If there are no problems, we will send the drawings to the tool factory for mass production."
    "Similar things happen every day. When advanced things come out in the factory, we go down to see if they are really advanced. If they are indeed good, we support them and organize their promotion."
    Speaking of this, the "Pravda" comrade interjected: "The day before yesterday, when I came here to make an appointment to talk to you, I saw Comrade Mitrofanov was looking at the drawings just sent by the factory. Only a day later, the factory is already mass-producing this new tool. You see, things here are progressing very quickly."
    Comrade Mitrofanov ignored this interjection and continued: "Helping backward enterprises become advanced enterprises is also an important responsibility of the Party organization. And to help backward enterprises, we cannot only use criticism, shouting in the ears of the factory director and the secretary of the Party committee. Instead, we must give them concrete help, and truly implement the experience of advanced enterprises there. For example, we have a "Forward" factory here, which failed to complete its tasks well last year. Therefore, the state Party committee studied the situation of this factory and decided that I should lead a working group to the factory. The people participating in this group all understand technology. We helped them analyze the reasons for their backwardness in the factory, promoted advanced production methods such as precision casting and "group processing" that I researched, and improved the organization of labor. Some measures that needed to be taken by the competent industrial department and administration were also helped by the factory to propose to the higher authorities and were resolved. Now, this factory often maintains the rotating red flag and has become an advanced factory that is well-known in the ministry and the city."
      "Similar examples can be cited a lot. Of course, the method is not only organizing a working group. Sometimes, we go to the factory to participate in the meetings of the Party organization, help them to carry out self-criticism and eliminate shortcomings. Sometimes, the secretary of the factory Party committee and the factory director come to the state Party committee to ask for help. We quickly help them solve any problems that can be solved locally. For problems that cannot be solved locally, we also forward them to the relevant ministries and bureaus as soon as possible to get them resolved."
    We wanted to know more about the state Party committee's connection with the masses. After Comrade Mitrofanov explained in detail to us the industrial situation in the Leningrad region and the implementation of the decisions of the Seventh Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the CPSU and the 20th Party Congress by the Party organization, we asked him:
      "Besides going down to the factory, do ordinary people often come to visit you?"
      "Of course. Almost every day, so-called "ordinary people" come to me. Some of them are Party members, some are non-Party members, there are workers, scientists, and engineers. The issues they talk about are related to production, and some are related to personal matters. Because we often go to the factory, ask the workers beside the machine tool whether their working conditions are good, see if their tools are placed in order, and get to know them very well. So they are willing to discuss any problems with us."
    He looked down at his watch and said with a smile; "The phone call that came in just now while we were talking was from a worker, and he wanted to make an appointment to talk to me. He may have already arrived and is waiting outside now."
    This reminded us that we had probably taken up too much of his time. Although there were still many things we wanted to ask, we had to suppress them, stand up, thank him, and say goodbye.
    Walking past the secretary's room, we saw that there was indeed a worker sitting there pensively, with his hands on his knees, waiting patiently. We thought that from this secretary of the state Party committee, who is both proficient in technology and familiar with workshop life, no matter whether he is eager to discuss production issues or personal life issues with him, he will probably leave this simple room as satisfied as we are.

### 州委书记

专栏：

    州委书记
    刚到列宁格勒，“真理报”的同志就通知我们，明天州委书记将和我们会见。我想，这样一位负责同志接见我们，大概只是一般地介绍一下列宁格勒州党的工作概况；作为记者，想寻找新鲜生动的材料，恐怕对这次会见不能抱多大希望。
    想不到，第二天上午坐到汽车上，“真理报”的同志闲谈似地告诉我们：我们将要会见的这位州委书记，是一个“有名的生产革新者”；他曾提出过许多合理化建议。他把一种很旧的机床——六角车床加以改造，能够加工很复杂的机件，为此还得到了副博士的学位。
    这真是想不到的新鲜事情。州委书记竟懂得技术！而且，不仅是一般地懂，还能在科学研究工作上有所成就！
    我们怀着极大的兴趣走进了这位州委书记的办公室。主人迎过来，热情地和我们握手。真理报的同志介绍说：“这就是米特洛凡诺夫同志。”
    这位州委书记有着一双蓝色的时时眨动的眼睛，远比我们想像的年轻。他听说我们很有兴趣知道他作为一个生产革新者的事迹，就坐下来简短地向我们介绍了自己的经历。
    他今年只有三十八岁。五年以前，还在工厂里担任生产总工程师的职务。一九五一年开始做党的工作。起初是区委书记，不久又做市委书记，现在当州委书记已经快一年了。
    他是学习机械制造的。一九五三年，他研究出一种“成组加工”的方法。在老式的六角车床上应用这种方法，效率可以提高40％—70％，调整车床的时间可以缩短50％—60％。在别种机床上使用这种方法，同样可以提高效率和缩短辅助时间。这种方法不仅对旧设备现代化有很大意义，而且对今后设计新机床也提供了重要的新鲜的思想。现在他研究出来的这种方法，已经被全苏联很多工厂采用了。
    研究工作还在继续进行。现在米特洛凡诺夫同志正在写一本书，对成组加工方法作进一步的详细的论述。同时，新的研究工作——博士学位论文的写作，又已经开始了。
    这是一个多么有毅力的人，又是一个多么特别的党的工作者呵！
    大概他误解了我们惊诧的神情，连忙补充说：
    “当然，我主要的工作还是党的工作。这些科学研究工作只能抽业余的时间来做。例如，晚上九点钟以后，休假的日子少休息一点，夏天起早一些，都可以挤出时间来。有时候干起劲来，要到深夜一两点钟才睡。”他笑着说：“俄国老话说，多休息总是比多工作好；人总是有惰性的，主要还是靠自己抓紧。”
    “自然，研究工作不能算做党的工作，”他接着讲。“但是，这同党的工作是有联系的。因为我负责领导工业，就应当是工业方面的内行、专家。党组织要领导企业不断钻研和采用新技术，党的工作者自己就应当懂得什么是新技术。只有这样，到工厂里去才能提出对厂里真正有帮助的建议，才能谈得上具体领导。我们苏联党的工作者都是熟悉专业知识的。州委的第二书记布列日涅夫同志负责领导农业，他就是一个农业博士，去年写了很厚的一本关于改进西红柿品种和增加西红柿产量的书。”
    我们想，一个州委书记，工作当然很忙，他要参加各种会议，要批阅文件，下厂的时间大概不会很多。于是，我们没有直截了当地使用“深入群众”这样的字眼，而是小心地、绕着弯地问：“你的工作很忙，是不是也能抽出一点时间到工厂去呢？”
    他望望我们，笑了一笑。
    回答又出乎我们意料：“我几乎每天都到工厂去。”他说。“在工厂里同工人和技术人员们交谈，了解生产情况，和他们共同研究采取那些措施来提高生产，这就是我们的日常工作，我们干的就是这种事。”看来这位书记很了解记者最有兴趣的是“具体的”东西。他停顿了一下，又接着说：“例如昨天吧，我就到基洛夫工厂去了。那里的生产革新者卡拉肖夫同志发明了一种新的效力非常高的铣刀。我到厂里，同卡拉肖夫同志、厂长、科学研究工作者一起，开了一个小会。我们决定，先在本厂制造一批这种新刀具，再试验一下。如果没有什么问题，就把图样送到工具工厂去大量制造。”
    “类似这样的事情天天有。工厂里出了先进的东西，我们就下去看看是不是真的先进。果然好，就支持他们，组织推广。”
    他讲到这里，真理报的同志插了进来：“前天我到这里来约会和你们谈话的事，看到米特洛凡诺夫同志正在看工厂刚刚送来的图样。才隔一天，工厂已经在成批制造这种新刀具了。你们看，这里的事情是进行得很快的。”
    米特洛凡诺夫同志不理会这段插话，又接着讲道：“帮助落后企业变成先进企业，同样是党组织的重要责任。而帮助落后企业，不能仅仅使用批评的方法，在厂长和党委书记的耳边叫喊。而是要给他们以具体帮助，把先进企业的经验真正在他们那里实行起来。例如，我们这里有一个
  “前进”工厂，去年一年总是不能很好地完成任务。于是，州委会研究了这个厂的情况，决定由我带领一个工作组到厂里去。参加这个组的人都是懂技术的。我们在厂里帮助他们分析了落后的原因，推行了精密铸造和我研究的“成组加工”等先进的生产方法，改进了劳动组织。有些需要主管的工业部和管理局采取的措施，也帮助工厂向上面提出来，得到了解决。现在，这个工厂经常保持着流动红旗，已经变成了一个在部里和市里都数得上先进的工厂。”
      “类似这样的例子还可以举出不少。当然，方式不只是组织工作组这一种。有的时候，我们到工厂去参加党组织的会议，帮助他们自己展开批评，消除缺点。有的时候，工厂党委书记、厂长到州委来请求帮助。凡是地方上能解决的问题，我们就很快地帮助他们解决了。地方上不能解决的，我们也转请有关的部、局，尽快地得到解决。”
    我们还想更多地知道州委和群众联系的情形。当米特洛凡诺夫同志详尽地向我们介绍了列宁格勒州的工业情况，党组织贯彻执行苏共中央七月全会和二十次党代表大会决议的情况之后，我们又提出问他：
      “除了下厂以外，是不是也常有普通群众来访问你呢？”
      “当然有。几乎每天都有所谓“普通人”到我这里来。他们有的是党员，有的是非党员，有工人、科学家、工程师。他们谈的问题有关于生产的，也有关于个人的。因为我们常常到工厂去，在机床旁边，问问工人们的工作条件好不好，看看他们的工具放得是不是有秩序，和他们搞得很熟。所以他们有什么问题都愿意找我们商量。”
    他低头看了看表，笑着说；“刚才我们说话中间来的那个电话，就是一个工人打来的，他要约我谈一谈。可能现在已经来了，在外面等着呢。”
    这提醒了我们：耽误他的时间恐怕太久了。虽然想问的事情还有很多，只好压下，站起来向他致谢，辞了出来。
    走过秘书的屋子，我们看到，真是有一个工人沉思地坐在那里，双手按在膝上，耐心地等待着。我们想，从这个既精通技术，又熟谙车间生活的州委书记那里，不管他急切要同他商量的是生产问题或是个人的生活问题，大概都会像我们一样，十分满意地离开这个朴素的房间吧。
