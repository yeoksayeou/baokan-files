    Strive for Three Harvests a Year
    (Our Dispatch) The spring silkworm cocoons in Yunnan Province have had a bumper harvest. The total output reached more than 3,000 dan, an increase of more than 1,400 dan compared with last year. This spring, the Provincial Department of Agriculture held silkworm training classes for agricultural cooperatives in various places and strengthened technical guidance in a timely manner. Therefore, the average output of each silkworm egg card this year increased by 13.2% compared with last year. In Qujing, Chengjiang and other counties, which were newly developed silkworm areas last year, and Fumin County, which was newly promoted this year, the average output of each silkworm egg card was more than ten jin. The Donggua Township Cooperative in Chuxiong raised 174 silkworm egg cards, and the silk can be sold for 8,000 yuan; in addition, there are more than 100 dan of silkworm droppings (silkworm manure), which can fertilize 390 mu of farmland. Now the agricultural cooperatives have begun to prepare for raising autumn silkworms, and some agricultural cooperatives also plan to try raising a season of late silkworms after harvesting autumn cocoons, striving for three harvests a year. The climate in the interior of Yunnan is warm, and mulberry trees are widely planted in rural areas, which is suitable for raising silkworms; in the plateau areas, the air is dry, and the survival rate of spring silkworms is also very high. Last year, agricultural cooperatives in eight special districts were engaged in silkworm production. This year, agricultural cooperatives in Wenshan, Mengzi and Kunming suburbs have also begun to raise spring silkworms. Silkworm production has become one of the main side businesses of agricultural cooperatives in various places. According to the plan of the Provincial Department of Agriculture, the province's silkworm cocoon output will reach 130,000 dan in five years. (Cun Zhen)

    争取一年收三次
    本报讯　云南省春茧普遍丰收，总产量达三千多担，比去年增产一千四百多担。今春，省农业厅为各地农业社举办了桑蚕训练班，并及时加强技术指导，因此，今年每张蚕种的平均产量比去年提高了13.2％。去年开辟的桑蚕新区曲靖、澄江等县和今年新推广的地区富明县，每张蚕种平均产量均在十市斤以上。楚雄东瓜乡合作社养了174张蚕种，蚕丝可售八千元；另外还有蚕沙（蚕粪）一百多担，可肥田三百九十亩。现在各农业社又开始做饲养秋蚕的准备工作，有些农业社还打算在收秋茧后再试养一季晚蚕，争取一年收三次。云南内地气候温暖，农村中种植桑树较普遍，适宜养蚕；高原地区，空气干燥，春蚕成活率也很高。去年已有八个专区的农业社经营桑蚕生产，今年又有文山、蒙自两个专区和昆明郊区的农业社开始饲养春蚕。桑蚕生产已成为各地农业社经营的主要副业之一。根据省农业厅的规划，五年后全省桑蚕茧产量将达十三万担。　（存真）
