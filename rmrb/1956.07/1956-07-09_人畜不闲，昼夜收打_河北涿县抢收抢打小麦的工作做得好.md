    People and Animals Not Idle, Harvesting Day and Night
    Zhuoxian County, Hebei Province Does a Good Job in Rushing to Harvest and Thresh Wheat
    (Our dispatch) Zhuoxian County, Hebei Province, has done a very good job in rushing to harvest and thresh wheat. The county has a total of 391,000 mu of winter and spring wheat, accounting for 44% of the county's cultivated land area. Just as the wheat was ripening, continuous rain threatened the wheat severely. In late June, the Zhuoxian County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party sent eight members of the County Committee, leading 106 cadres, to three districts with more wheat production, to contract and specifically promote various cooperatives to carry out a rush harvesting and threshing campaign, ensuring that all cooperatives were "not idle, day and night." In Diwo District, where livestock was insufficient, more than 4,800 laborers were organized to specialize in carrying wheat. Tongcun Township could only transport three to five carts of wheat per day at the beginning. Later, a method of harvesting in the front and transporting in the back was adopted, and five to ten carts could be transported every day. In terms of rushing to thresh, various townships also grasped it very tightly. Some places adopted manual threshing and night threshing methods to overcome the difficulty of not being able to thresh on cloudy days. The Baofeng Agricultural Production Cooperative in Dongxianpo Township, Xia Huliang District, threshed 14,000 jin in just one night on June 28th. By the end of June, 389,700 mu of wheat in the county had been harvested and transported home, of which 200,000 mu of wheat had been threshed the first time. (Liu Jincai)

    人畜不闲，昼夜收打
    河北涿县抢收抢打小麦的工作做得好
    本报讯　河北省涿县抢收抢打小麦的工作做得很好。这个县共有冬小麦和春小麦三十九万一千亩，占全县耕地面积的44％。正当小麦成熟时期，阴雨连绵，小麦受到了严重的威胁。中共涿县县委会在六月下旬派出八名县委委员，带领106名干部，分赴三个产麦较多的区，分工包干，具体推动各个合作社开展抢收抢打的突击运动，各个社都做到“人畜不闲，昼夜不停”。刁窝区牲畜不足，就组织了4，800多个劳动力专门担任扛麦。佟村乡开始每天只能运三车到五车麦，后来采取前边收、后边运的办法，每天可运五车到十车。在抢打方面，各乡也抓得很紧。有的地方采取人工摔打和夜间打场的办法，克服了阴天不能打场的困难。下胡良区东仙坡乡保丰农业生产合作社，只六月二十八日一夜就摔打了一万四千斤。到六月底止，全县已有三十八万九千七百亩小麦收运到家，其中有二十万亩的小麦已打完头场。　（刘晋才）
