Xinhua News Agency, Shantou, 28th -- The more than 310,000 mu of early rice in Chao'an County, Guangdong Province, has been basically harvested. According to preliminary estimates, the average yield per mu has reached more than 450 jin, an increase of about 12% compared to last year.

The secretary of the Chao'an County Party Committee told a Xinhua News Agency reporter: This year, the county's early rice has achieved a comprehensive bumper harvest, which is the result of the county strengthening leadership over mountainous and low-yield areas. The early rice yield in these areas has increased compared to last year. Dushu District, which had the lowest yield last year, harvested an average of 429 jin of grain per mu this year, more than double the yield of last year.

In the past, the county leadership did not pay enough attention to mountainous and low-yield areas and failed to guide production according to the characteristics of the region. Last year, although the county's double-cropping rice achieved a high yield of 1,017.34 jin per mu on average, the average yield per mu in the six mountainous and low-yield areas (out of a total of thirteen districts in the county) was only 803.71 jin. This year, after basically realizing agricultural cooperativization, in order to strive for a comprehensive bumper harvest, the county party committee specially transferred a deputy secretary and assigned a group of strong cadres to lead production in these areas.

Water and drought disasters pose a great threat to agricultural production in these areas. Therefore, before the spring plowing, the county party committee focused on water conservancy construction in mountainous and low-yield areas. Five of the six key water conservancy projects built and expanded in the county benefited these areas. In the past, the farming techniques in these areas were also relatively backward. This year, the agricultural technology department focused on training a group of farmer technicians for these six districts, and also organized them to visit and study in the plains areas during the spring plowing and rice transplanting. Therefore, early rice in these areas has all implemented close planting with small seedlings and single and double seedlings, and other series of technical reforms have also been widely promoted. In May, when rice blast began to occur in these areas, the county party committee organized forces, issued loans, and supplied pesticides for continuous prevention and treatment, so that early rice basically suffered no losses.

The county's early rice has achieved a bumper harvest because mountainous and low-yield areas have had bumper harvests, and the previously high-yield areas have also increased production compared to last year.

### 去年的千斤县，今年又增产

    去年的千斤县，今年又增产
    新华社汕头28日电　广东省潮安县的31万多亩早稻已经基本收割完毕，据初步估计：平均每亩产量达到450斤以上，比去年增产12％左右。
    中共潮安县委书记对新华社记者说：今年，这个县的早稻全面大丰收，是这个县对山区和低产区加强领导的结果。这些地区的早稻产量，都比去年提高了。去年产量最低的独树区，今年早稻平均每亩收谷429斤，比去年增产一倍多。
    这个县的领导上，过去对山区和低产区是重视不够的，没有根据地区特点来领导生产。去年，虽然全县的双季稻平均每亩得到一零一七点三四斤的高额产量，但六个山区和低产区（全县共有十三个区）平均每亩的产量只有803.71斤。今年，在基本实现农业合作化以后，为了争取全面丰收，县委特地抽调了一名副书记和配备一批较强的干部，来到这些地区领导生产。
    水旱灾害对这些地区的农业生产威胁极大。因此，春耕前，县委便把兴修水利工作的重点放在山区和低产区。全县兴建和扩建的六宗重点水利工程，有五宗是这些地区受益的。过去，这些地区的耕作技术也比较落后。今年，农业技术部门着重为这六个区培养了一批农民技术员，春耕插秧时还组织他们到平原区去观摩学习。因此，这些地区的早稻已经全部实行了小株密植和单、双株密植，其他一系列的技术改革也普遍推广了。在五月间，当这些地区开始发生稻热病的时候，县委组织力量，发放贷款和供应农药，连续进行防治，使早稻基本上没受损失。
    这个县的早稻，因为山区和低产区丰收了，再加过去的高产区也比去年增了产，全县就获得了大丰收。
