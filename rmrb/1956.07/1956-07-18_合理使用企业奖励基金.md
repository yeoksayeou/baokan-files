    Rational Use of Enterprise Reward Funds
    Tián Gōng
    How to rationally use enterprise reward funds to solve the difficulties in the lives of employees is a problem that urgently needs to be solved. Today, the situation of some units in Heilongjiang Province misusing enterprise reward funds, as published in this newspaper, precisely illustrates the seriousness of this problem.
    The state's establishment of the enterprise reward fund system is a form of material encouragement for enterprise units that implement economic accounting after completing state plans. Through this encouragement, the aim is to stimulate all employees to care about production, strive to improve labor productivity, and increase interest in enterprise profitability. Then, a certain percentage of the enterprise reward fund is extracted from the profits to improve the working and material conditions of employees by holding collective welfare activities, rewarding advanced producers, improving or expanding production equipment, and providing relief to employees in difficulty. This is a good way to combine national interests with individual interests.
    However, some leaders of units, when using this fund, only consider their own convenience, disregarding the interests of employees. They mistakenly believe that the enterprise reward fund is the factory director's personal fund, which the factory director can "freely" dispose of, and no one else can interfere. Some factory directors, under the pretext of "secrecy," not only do not report the usage to the employee congress, but even do not allow the trade union to know.
    As a result, many strange phenomena have emerged: some spend money indiscriminately, treating the enterprise reward fund as an all-purpose expense, even distributing dividends according to the proportion of wages; others accumulate surpluses year after year, freezing them unused, and the actual difficulties of employees remain unresolved. According to the Wuhan Federation of Trade Unions' investigation of materials from four industries and four districts in Wuhan, from January 1950 to June 1955, the amount of fund surplus accounted for 39.63% of the amount extracted, with some reaching 90.61%.
    Recently, there have also been instances of non-enterprise units requesting donations from the bonus. In the 1955 enterprise reward fund distribution and usage table of the Tangshan Kailuan Coal Mine, there is a figure of "50,000 yuan donated to the Municipal Party Committee Cadre School." Why is the bonus earned by Kailuan coal miners through a year of hard work "donated" to the Municipal Party Committee Cadre School? Has the problem of the difficulties of Kailuan employees been completely resolved? No, they have many problems: only 36.16% of the employees live in public housing, and it is very crowded, with seven or eight people living in one room, and three or four generations living in one room; there are also those who cannot live in public housing and have to live twenty miles away. In the Linxi district, many female workers do not even have a place to bathe or rest, and some female workers have to resign because they do not have a nursery and cannot afford a nanny; as for many other problems, it goes without saying.
    Why are these unreasonable phenomena such as misuse, accumulation, and donation of reward funds left unaddressed? It is said that there are many difficulties in addressing these matters, and some Party committees are the parties involved. For example, the donation of bonuses by the Kailuan Mine was the intention of the Tangshan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China. Then, why don't the trade union cadres of these enterprise units question the administration on behalf of the employees? Does the trade union not understand the suffering of the masses? Does the trade union not understand the basis and purpose of enterprise reward fund extraction? It is undeniable that the trade union has serious shortcomings in this regard. The trade unions of some units only ask the administration to allocate relief funds, without asking about the overall use of the fund. Some believe that the proportion of relief funds is too small to solve practical problems, thus abandoning the responsibilities that the trade union should bear.
    In order to eliminate the phenomenon of large accumulation and unreasonable use of enterprise reward funds, trade union organizations should effectively assist the administration in studying the actual problems in production and the lives of workers, formulate a fund usage plan, mobilize the masses to discuss it, and require the administration to report to the employees regularly; at the same time, relevant departments should absorb past experience and quickly formulate a new method to further clarify the scope of use of enterprise reward funds. Only in this way can we achieve the goal of rationally using funds and encouraging the production enthusiasm of employees.

    合理使用企业奖励基金
    田工
    怎样合理使用企业奖励基金来解决职工生活上的困难，是一个急待解决的问题。今天，本报发表的黑龙江省有些单位滥用企业奖励基金的情况，正好说明这个问题的严重性。
    国家建立企业奖励基金制度，是对实行经济核算制的企业单位在完成国家计划以后的一种物质鼓励。通过这种鼓励，刺激全体职工关心生产，努力提高劳动生产率，增加对企业赢利的兴趣。然后，从赢利中提取一定比例的企业奖励基金，通过举办集体福利事业、奖励先进生产者、改进或扩充生产设备和救济困难职工的方式，来改善职工的劳动条件和物质条件。这是把国家利益和个人利益结合起来的一个好办法。
    可是，有些单位的领导人使用这笔基金的时候，只图自己方便，不顾职工利益，他们错误地认为企业奖励基金是厂长个人的基金，由厂长“自由”支配，别人不能过问；有的厂长借口“保密”，不但不把使用情况向职工大会报告，甚至连工会也不让知道。
    于是，出现了许多奇怪的现象：有的乱花乱用，把企业奖励基金当做万能费，甚至按工资比例分红；有的年年结余，冻结不用，职工的实际困难无人解决。据武汉市工会联合会调查武汉四个产业和四个区的材料，从1950年1月到1955年6月为止，基金结余数占提取数39.63％，有的达到90.61％。
    最近还出现了非企业单位要求捐赠奖金的事情。唐山开滦煤矿1955年度企业奖励基金分配使用表中，就有一项“应摊负捐赠市委干校捐款五万元”的数字。为什么开滦煤矿工人一年辛勤劳动得来的奖金，“捐赠”给市委干校呢？难道开滦职工的困难问题已经完全解决了吗？不，他们的问题很多：职工们住进工房的仅有36.16％，而且非常拥挤，有七八口住一间的，也有三四辈住一间的；还有住不进工房每天要到二十里以外居住的。林西区有许多女工连洗澡、休息的地方也没有，有的女工因为没有乳儿室，又请不起保姆，只好退职；至于其他许多问题当然更不用提了。
    为什么这些滥用、积压和捐赠奖励基金等不合理的现象无人过问呢？据说过问这些事也有不少的困难，有些党委就是当事人。像开滦矿捐赠奖金就是中共唐山市委的意图。那么，为什么这些企业单位的工会干部不代表职工向行政提出质询，难道工会不了解群众的疾苦吗？工会不懂得企业奖励基金提取的根据和用途吗？不可否认，工会在这方面是有着严重缺点的。有些单位的工会只管向行政要求拨交救济金，不问整个基金使用情况。有的认为救济金比例过小，不能解决实际问题，从而放弃了工会应负的职责。
    为了消除企业奖励基金大量积存和使用不合理的现象，工会组织应当切实协助行政研究生产和工人生活中的实际问题，订出基金使用计划，发动群众进行讨论，并要求行政定期向职工作报告；同时，有关部门应该吸收过去的经验，迅速制定一个新的办法，进一步明确企业奖励基金的使用范围。只有这样，才能达到合理使用基金，鼓励职工生产积极性的目的。
