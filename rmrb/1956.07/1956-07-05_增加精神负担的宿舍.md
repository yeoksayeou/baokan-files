    Dormitory That Increases Mental Burden
    Comrade Editor:
    In people's lives, defecation and urination are generally not a problem. However, in the Zigulu Cadre Dormitory of the Jiangxi Provincial People's Committee, it has actually become a problem. Because the entire dormitory has no toilets, and there are no public toilets nearby, we have to rush to the office, which is more than half a kilometer away from the dormitory, to defecate or urinate. What if we get sick? It's unimaginable. Moreover, many of the houses in our dormitory are dilapidated and face east to west. In summer, the situation is even worse. On rainy days, it rains heavily outside, and drizzles inside, sometimes making it impossible to stand. What about sunny days? The sun shines from 12 noon until 6:30 in the afternoon, making the house like a steamer. As soon as you enter the house, you sweat all over, from head to toe. Therefore, every day when we work until almost the end of the day, the thought of sleeping becomes a burden.
    We have reported the above situation to the leadership several times, but it has not been resolved. Is it really impossible to solve? No, for example, there are three or four empty rooms in the compound of the Provincial People's Committee, which are often locked, but are not given to cadres to live in. Is this reasonable?

    增加精神负担的宿舍
    编辑同志：
    在人们的生活中，大小便总是不大会发生问题的，但是，在我们江西省人民委员会子固路干部宿舍中，竟然成了问题。因为整个宿舍没有厕所，附近地区也没有公共厕所，我们要大、小便都得赶到离开宿舍一里多路的办公室里去，生了病怎么办呢？更不堪设想。而且我们这个宿舍有很多房子既是破破烂烂，又是坐东向西，到了夏天，情况更加狼狈。下雨天，室外下大雨，室内下小雨，有时简直无立足之地。晴天呢？日晒时间从上午十二点一直到下午六点半，屋子好像蒸笼，一进屋就满身流汗，从头流到脚。所以我们每天工作到快下班时，一想到睡觉问题，就觉得成了一种负担。
    以上情况，我们虽向领导上反映过几次，但一直得不到解决。是不是确实无法解决呢？不，如省人民委员会院内就有三、四间空房子，经常锁着，但不给干部住。这是合理的吗？　之光
