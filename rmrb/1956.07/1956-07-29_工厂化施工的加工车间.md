Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, July 27th: The Anshan Metallurgical Chemical Construction General Company is building three prefabrication workshops for industrialized construction. These three workshops are a steel-wire concrete workshop, a foam concrete workshop, and a mastic asphalt workshop.

	The steel-wire concrete workshop is China's first formalized steel-wire concrete production workshop. It will produce products such as roof truss beams, purlins, and roof panels. Roof truss beams made of this steel-wire concrete can save 50% to 70% of steel compared to prefabricated components made of ordinary reinforced concrete.

	The roof panels produced by the foam concrete workshop are more durable than ordinary reinforced concrete roof panels, and can also eliminate the construction procedure of a foam layer. Once the mastic asphalt workshop is put into production, it will solve the long-standing problem of poor-quality roof waterproofing in Anshan Iron and Steel construction. Mastic asphalt can also be used for foundation waterproofing projects.

	These three processing workshops have started construction in June and July respectively, and are scheduled to be put into production in the fourth quarter.

    工厂化施工的加工车间
    新华社鞍山27日电　鞍山冶金化学建筑总公司正在兴建三个工厂化施工的加工车间。这三个车间是钢弦混凝土车间、泡沫混凝土车间和玛?脂车间。
    钢弦混凝土车间是中国第一个正规化生产钢弦混凝土的车间。它将生产屋架梁、檩条、屋面板等产品。用这种钢弦混凝土制成的屋架梁，比用普通钢筋混凝土预制构件能节省50％到70％的钢材。
    泡沫混凝土车间将生产的屋面板，比一般的钢筋混凝土的屋面板耐用，而且还可以省去一道泡沫层的施工程序。玛?脂车间投入生产以后，就可以解决鞍钢建设中长期没有解决的屋面防水工程质量不好的问题。玛?脂还可以作基础的防水工程之用。
    这三个加工车间已经先后在六、七月间动工兴建，按照计划准备在第四季度投入生产。
