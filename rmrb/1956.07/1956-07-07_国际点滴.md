    The Source of Election Funds
    Next autumn, West Germany will hold general elections. Not long ago, the Bavarian business organization "Economic and Political Association" sent a circular to its members, which read: "It must be admitted that the current Federal Parliament often maintains an 'understanding attitude' towards the demands of business groups. Therefore, extensive assistance must be prepared in the new election."
    Thus, the Bavarian Association of Large Businesses passed a resolution: All association members will contribute fifty to eighty pfennigs of election funds for every 10,000 marks of goods sold.
    "Free Vacation"
    Three American adventurers brought American-made fake dice to Monte Carlo, a famous gambling city in Southern Europe, to try their luck. Unfortunately, their methods were not clever and were exposed on the spot, so they were thrown into prison.
    The American "Time Magazine" reported this incident in very polite terms, saying that the local judge had decided to "invite these three Californian Americans" to spend "a free vacation of six months to a year" in the Monte Carlo prison.

    选举经费的来源
    明年秋天，西德就要举行大选。不久前，巴伐利亚大企业组织“经济政治联合会”向各个会员发出一份通函，这个通函写道：“不能不承认，现在的联邦议会对于企业团体的要求经常保持‘谅解的态度’。所以必须在新选举上准备予以广泛的帮助”。
    于是，巴伐利亚大商业联合会通过决议：一切联合会会员每销售一万马克货物抽五十到八十芬尼的选举捐。
    “免费的假期”
    三个美国冒险家带了美制假骰子，到南欧著名赌城蒙特卡罗碰运气，可惜手法不灵，当场被人识破，因此啷呛入狱。
    美国“时代周刊”用很体面的话报道这件事情说，当地的法官已经决定“邀请这三位美国加州人士”，在蒙特卡罗监狱里“免费渡半年至一年的假期”。
