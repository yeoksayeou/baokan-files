    Actively Help Commune Members Develop Family Sidelines
    (Our Newspaper News) The Victory Agricultural Production Cooperative in Zhangjiabian Township, Zhongshan County, Guangdong Province, while developing the collective sidelines of the cooperative, helps commune members develop family sidelines, and the collective economy and family economy have both shown a thriving atmosphere.
    This cooperative is an advanced cooperative with more than 2,100 households. Their agricultural production is very good, and they also operate a variety of sidelines. In addition to raising a large number of sows, meat pigs, female ducks, and meat ducks, they also grow sugarcane, lychees, bananas, melons, vegetables, beans and other crops with high economic value. In addition, mining teams, stone blasting teams, fishing teams, clam digging teams, carpentry teams, and bicycle transportation teams are formed to carry out sideline production. In May, the total income of the cooperative from the production of duck eggs, meat ducks, and lychees alone was more than 5,200 yuan. It is estimated that the total sideline income of the cooperative will reach 150,000 yuan by the end of the year.
    The family sidelines of the commune members are also very developed. In this township, people can see fat pigs and flocks of chickens and ducks everywhere. By mid-June, the number of sows raised by commune members themselves had reached 800, meat pigs reached 1,500, and chickens and ducks reached about 25,000. The total number of pigs raised by commune member families has exceeded the standard of "one pig per household," and is now moving towards the goal of "two or three pigs per household"; the number of chickens and ducks will also be greatly increased.
    The family sidelines of the Victory Cooperative's commune members have only developed in the past two months. Originally, commune members have always had the habit of raising pigs. A few months ago, because many people were not clear about the boundary between family sidelines and capitalist operations, commune members did not dare to raise pigs anymore. Later, the Agricultural Cooperative Management Committee explained to the commune members that engaging in family sidelines was by no means capitalist operation, and the cooperative cadres took the lead in engaging in family sidelines; at the same time, the agricultural cooperative bought more than 500 piglets and lent them to the commune members, and encouraged the commune members living near the mountains to open up a few acres of wasteland to grow sweet potatoes, and the commune members living near the water to grow water hyacinths to solve the problem of pig feed. As a result, the commune members happily resumed and developed the sideline of raising pigs, and at the same time raised a large number of chickens and ducks. The commune member Yang Chaodai has an income of five or six jiao a day just from chicken and duck eggs, which is enough for the whole family's expenses for oil, salt, lamp oil, and his own smoking. The commune member Lin Jinkai can have an income of 150 yuan from selling pigs alone by the end of the year.

### 主动帮助社员发展家庭副业

    主动帮助社员发展家庭副业
    本报讯　广东中山县张家边乡胜利农业生产合作社在发展社的集体副业的同时，帮助社员发展家庭副业，集体经济、家庭经济都出现了一片兴旺的气象。
    这个社是2，100多户的高级社。他们的农业生产搞得很好，并经营了多种多样的副业。除了养大量的母猪、肉猪、母鸭、肉鸭以外，还种了甘蔗、荔枝、香蕉、瓜菜、豆类等经济价值高的作物。另外，又组成开矿队、爆石队、捕鱼队、捞蚬队、木工队、单车运输队进行副业生产。在五月份，全社仅鸭蛋、肉鸭、荔枝等项生产收入就有5，200多元。预计到年底全社副业总收入将达到15万元。
    社员们的家庭副业也很发达。在这个乡里，人们到处可以看到肥大的猪只、成群的鸡鸭。到六月中旬，社员自养的母猪已达到800头，肉猪达到1，500头，鸡鸭达到25，000只左右。社员家庭养猪的总数已超过“一户一猪”的标准，现在正在向“一户二、三只猪”的目标前进；鸡鸭也要大大增加。
    胜利社社员的家庭副业是最近两个多月才发展起来的。本来，社员从来就有养猪的习惯。几个月前，由于许多人对于家庭副业同资本主义经营的界限划不清楚，社员不敢再养猪。后来，农业社管理委员会向社员说明搞家庭副业决不是资本主义经营，社干部又带头搞起家庭副业；同时，农业社又买了五百多头小猪借给社员，并且鼓励住在山边的社员开几分荒地种甘薯、住在水边的社员种植水浮莲，解决猪的饲料问题。于是，社员们都高高兴兴地恢复和发展了养猪的副业，同时养了大量的鸡鸭。社员杨朝带，每天光是鸡、鸭蛋的收入就有五、六角钱，足够全家的油、盐、灯油以及他自己吸烟的开支。社员林金开，到年底光卖猪就可以有150元的收入。
