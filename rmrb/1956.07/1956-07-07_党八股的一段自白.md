    A Monologue of Party Stereotype
    Zhong Xiuda
    (Since the Party Stereotype was vigorously opposed in 1942, it has been like a rat running across the street, with everyone yelling to beat it, and it had almost nowhere to hide. In recent years, I don't know how, it has re-emerged and become a guest on some newspapers. Many editors receive it cordially and consult it. In a moment of joy, it revealed a piece of its mind.)

    I often encounter my mortal enemy, "Popularization." It wants to "ize," and I also want to "ize," which is "formalization and conceptualization." Readers stand on its side, but some editors stand on my side.

    I have only one magic weapon in my life: the frame. If the content of the manuscript is too rich and difficult to process, I use a frame to enclose it, solving the problem in half an hour, producing quickly and saving brainpower. Writing about work experience usually involves: 1. Basic situation, 2. Existing problems, 3. Solutions. Writing about production activities is nothing more than: At the beginning, there were many problems, the masses were complacent and paralyzed. After in-depth inspection, they were greatly surprised. Cadres deployed tasks, and the movement developed vigorously. When talking about achievements, a statistical table is opened; when writing about the enthusiasm of the masses, a series of adjectives are used. In order to show the importance of the article, it must be written long. An article introducing the experience of a low-level cooperative turning into a high-level cooperative took up the space of one issue of an eight-page newspaper. Unfortunately, the farmers hated it, saying it was "irritating to read and annoying to listen to," and even said it was "breath-taking to read." Therefore, I gave the editor an idea to introduce three experiences in a news item of dozens of words. But some people said it was dry and tasteless.

    This really hurts my self-esteem. I don't believe I can't come up with a beautiful article. I once helped a county newspaper compile a wonderful passage: "The murmuring swallows are flying in the clear sky, the willows by the river are sprouting tender buds, nature has broken away from the severe winter and presents a bright spring scene." The comment received was: "Full of nonsense."

    The masses' reflections are completely ignored by me; anyway, the editors trust me. I know some of them are also unwilling to leave me. When I teach them to write稿子 manuscripts, I inevitably use words like "through what," "basically," "have certain achievements," "played a huge role," and "strive for..." To describe people's happiness, it is "enthusiastic mood" and "immersed in joy." Since they completely rely on me, I am also "immersed in joy."

    But there are also special circumstances. When they write letters to friends, they never ask me for help. Let alone writing letters to their loved ones. I really can't bear to see them looking sad, so I spent three minutes helping an editor draft a letter to his lover:

    ××: I haven't completed the task of writing a letter for almost a month. I think there are basically the following reasons: First of all, the work is really too busy. Specifically, first,...

    In short, it is absolutely necessary to consider some specific issues under certain conditions. Of course, my shortcomings are also serious, mainly manifested in: insufficient understanding of the necessity of completing this writing task. In the future, I must strive to overcome this shortcoming.

                        ×× above

    As soon as I put down my pen, I observed his expression. Not only did he not appreciate it, but he angrily scolded me for being dry and ugly, and unable to express his passionate feelings at all.

    This is really thankless. I thought, this is going to be a fallout. Unexpectedly, as soon as he finished writing the letter, he went to edit the manuscript, so he immediately shook hands with me again and made peace, as if nothing unpleasant had happened between us.

    党八股的一段自白
    钟秀达
    （党八股自从在1942年被大张旗鼓地反对了之后，老鼠过街，人人喊打，几乎无处存身。最近几年不知怎么一来，他又冒出头来，到一些报纸上作客了。不少编辑都殷勤地接待他，向他请教。他在高兴之余，谈出了一段心里的话。）
    我现在常常碰到我的死对头“通俗化”。他要“化”，我也要“化”，就是“公式化、概念化”。读者站在他那边，有些编辑却站在我这边。
    我生平只有一个法宝：框子。如果稿子内容太丰富，加工有困难，我就用框子一框，半个钟头里面解决问题，出品快，又节省脑力。写工作经验，通常是：一、基本情况、二、存在问题、三、解决办法。写生产活动，又不外乎：开头问题很多，群众自满麻痹，经过深入检查，不觉大吃一惊；干部布置任务，运动蓬勃开展。谈成绩，就开一张统计表；写群众的热情，叫形容词叠罗汉。为了表示文章的重要，一定要写得长。有篇介绍一个低级社转为高级社的经验的文章，就花了一期八开报纸的篇幅。遗憾的是，农民竟讨厌它，说是“读起来性急煞，听起来厌烦煞”，甚至说“读得要断气”。于是，我又给编辑出了个主意，要他在几十个字的消息里介绍三条经验。可是又有人说它枯燥乏味。
    这实在伤害我的自尊心。我不相信自己竟拿不出一篇漂亮文章。我曾帮助一个县报编过一段精采的文字：“喃喃的燕子在晴空飞翔，河边的杨柳吐出了嫩芽，大自然脱离了严寒的冬天，呈现出一片明媚的春色”。得到的批语是：“废话连篇”。
    群众反映，在我完全是耳边风，反正编辑同志信得过就行。我知道他们有些人也不愿意离开我。我教他们编写稿子，少不了用“通过什么什么”、“基本上”、“有一定的成就”、“起了巨大的作用”、“……而奋斗”的字眼；形容人的高兴，是“情绪热烈”、“沉浸在欢乐里”。他们既然完全依赖我，我也就“沉浸在欢乐里”了。
    但也有特殊情况。他们给朋友写信，就从来不叫我帮忙。给爱人写信更不用说。我实在不忍心看到他们愁眉苦脸的样子，于是用了三分钟的工夫，帮助一位编辑拟好了一封给爱人的信：
    ××：近一个月我一直没有完成写信任务。我想基本上有如下几点原因：首先，工作实在太忙。具体地说，第一，……
    总之，在一定条件下考虑一些具体问题，是完全必要的。当然，我的缺点也是严重的，主要表现在：对完成这个写信任务的必要性还认识不足。今后，我一定要为克服这个缺点而奋斗。
                        ××上
    我一放下笔，就观察他的表情。他不但不领情，反而怒气冲冲地骂我干瘪难看，根本表达不出他的热烈的感情。
    这真是好心不得好报。我想，这下子可闹翻了。想不到他刚写好信，就去编稿子，于是又马上跟我握手言欢了，仿佛我们之间并没有发生过什么不愉快的事情。
