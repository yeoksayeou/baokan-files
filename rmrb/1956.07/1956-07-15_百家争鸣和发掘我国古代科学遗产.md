Hundred Schools of Thought and Excavating China's Ancient Scientific Heritage
Zhu Kezhen

From July 9th to 12th, the Chinese Academy of Sciences held the First Symposium on the History of Natural Sciences in China in Beijing. This is precisely the time when our country is formulating a twelve-year science and technology development plan, and it is also the time when our scientific workers should strive to approach the international scientific level in various important departments in the short term. At this time, holding such a meeting, some people may raise questions: If we want to approach the international level in the short term, then we must catch up and learn the most advanced technology, apply the most effective scientific methods, and master the latest tools. On this basis, we can go deeper to establish our new science. If we look for problems in old paper piles and summarize experiences in remote areas, isn't it going in the opposite direction to reach the international scientific level? I think this idea is wrong. Modern science has made rapid progress, and we must not fall behind forever, we must catch up quickly, that's right. But this does not preclude us from sorting out ancient scientific heritage and enriching our scientific knowledge with the experience of the ancients. One of the characteristics of science is its cumulative nature, and the discoveries of later generations are often based on the achievements of predecessors. Without Copernicus's theory of the Earth revolving around the Sun, without Kepler's three laws of planetary motion, there would be no Newton's law of universal gravitation. Li Shizhen's Compendium of Materia Medica in the Ming Dynasty was a collection of materials collected and collated by countless people since the Han and Tang Dynasties. As the ancient saying goes, "The rivers and seas do not refuse small streams, so they can become great." For three or four thousand years, the wisdom of the working people in our country has been infinite, and this kind of wisdom is hidden in the objects and projects built in the past dynasties, scattered in oral secret recipes and ballads, and even more recorded in classics, histories, philosophical works, and collections of literature. Comrade Lu Dingyi once said in his report "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom, Let a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend," "We must learn knowledge extensively, and we must learn critically from the past and the present, from China and foreign countries, from friends and enemies." He also said, "We must learn knowledge extensively. Our country has many legacies in medicine, agronomy, philosophy, history, literature, drama, painting, music, etc., which should be carefully studied and critically accepted. Not too much work has been done in this area, but too little, not seriously enough, and the idea of ​​underestimating national heritage still exists, and in some departments it is still very serious." Critically studying our country's cultural and scientific heritage is indeed a solemn research work. According to my personal very superficial view, this research should make contributions in three aspects.

    First, we must correctly estimate the position occupied by the Chinese nation in the history of world culture. We must estimate the contributions of ancient Chinese science, as well as China's contributions in philosophy, art, and literature. Thirty years ago, a famous British mathematician and philosopher, Whitehead, had the following estimation of the contributions of ancient Chinese art, literature, philosophy, and natural science in the history of world culture: "The more we know about Chinese art, literature, and philosophy of life, the more we admire the high level of ancient Chinese culture. For thousands of years, China has had intelligent and knowledgeable scholars who have devoted their lives to research. If we add up the contributions of all the figures in the historical era, then Chinese culture can be regarded as the most magnificent in the world. We have no doubt that the Chinese have the talent to explore natural science, but their achievements in natural science are negligible. And if China is isolated from the world, there is no reason to believe that she will have any achievements in science." Whitehead's disregard for the achievements of ancient Chinese science is due to the fact that we ourselves have not properly sorted out, understood, and publicized the achievements of ancient Chinese scientists, so that the discoveries and inventions obtained by the hard work of the ancients can get the place they should occupy in the history of world culture. Before liberation, Chinese intellectuals living in a semi-feudal and semi-colonial social system rarely paid attention to the contributions of ancient science and technology. Even the importance of the four great inventions of ancient times, namely the compass, papermaking, printing, and gunpowder, was neglected by all but a few people. To know the importance of several ancient Chinese discoveries in the history of world culture, it is best to look at Engels' "Dialectics of Nature." As Professor Bernal of England said, Engels' "Dialectics of Nature" is the best short compilation of the history of modern natural science. In his book "Dialectics of Nature," Engels mentioned paper, compass, printing, and flintlock when talking about several most important inventions in history, and these inventions were all transmitted from China to Europe at the end of the Middle Ages. In the introduction to this book, Engels said, "Modern natural science, like the entire modern history, dates from such a great era, which we Germans call the Reformation due to the national disasters we encountered at that time, and the French call the Renaissance." The occurrence of the European Renaissance in the fifteenth century was by no means accidental. Before the middle of the fifteenth century, all books in Europe were handwritten, but in the fifty years of the second half of the fifteenth century, as many as two million copies of books were printed in Europe. The widespread influence of printing is difficult to estimate. George Sarton, the chief writer of the International Journal of the History of Natural Sciences, in his recent book "The Experience of Ancient Science in the Renaissance," dated the European Renaissance from 1450, the year when Europe began to print books. Therefore, if we regard the discovery of paper and printing in Chinese history as two epoch-making great discoveries, it can be said to be well-deserved. When Engels talked about the Renaissance, he also said: "The boundaries of the old world were broken, and it was only at this time that the earth was truly discovered, laying the foundation for future world trade and the transition from handicraft industry to workshop handicraft industry, and workshop handicraft industry is the starting point of modern large industry." What broke the boundaries of the old world was Columbus's discovery of the New World in 1492. But if the compass had not been introduced to Europe in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, Columbus's discovery of the New World would have been problematic. Because before the compass was introduced to Europe, sailors from Portugal, Spain, and Italy never dared to stray far from the Mediterranean. Even when Columbus first crossed the Atlantic, his calculations of distance and expected goals were completely inconsistent with reality. The compass was a "magic weapon" in Columbus's hands, giving him the courage to complete his mission. This can be said to be another great contribution of ancient China to the European Renaissance.

    Printing and compasses are discoveries in China that have long been famous in the world, but our ancient technical discoveries that spread to the world are far more than that. In the first volume of his "Science and Technology in China," Dr. Joseph Needham of Cambridge University in England listed twenty-six technologies that were introduced from China to Europe in the eighteen hundred years from the Eastern Han Dynasty to the Qing Dynasty, and China has not yet fully understood the technologies that were transmitted to Europe. I am very ashamed to admit that I am ignorant of most of the fact that these twenty-six inventions were introduced to Europe. Recently, Liu Xianzhou, Vice President of Tsinghua University, and Dr. Joseph Needham have successively introduced the astronomical clock described in Su Song's "Xin Yi Xiang Fa Yao" in the Northern Song Dynasty. According to Mr. Plass, a British expert specializing in the history of clocks and watches, clocks and watches were the most complicated machines in the world before the middle of the nineteenth century. Therefore, to study the source of modern complex machines, we must first study the source of clocks and watches. The development history of Western clocks and watches from 1500 to the present is very clear, but the history before 1500 is unclear, and we can only say that it evolved from ancient methods such as sundials and copper clepsydras in ancient Egypt and Greece. Research in the past two decades has further increased the difficulty of explanation, because the new knowledge has made it clear that the earliest European clocks were already extremely complex machines, and timekeeping was an incidental function, and the main function was the cycle of day and night stars. In this way, the form of European clocks in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries is very similar to the astronomical clock made by Su Song. The difference is that Su Song's astronomical clock can be traced back to the instruments of Zhang Sixun, the Si Tian Jian (Directorate of Astronomy) in the early Northern Song Dynasty, and the instruments made by Yi Xing and Liang Lingzan in the Kaiyuan period of the Tang Dynasty, but there is no such clue to be found in Europe. More importantly, Su Song's device already has a gear system similar to an escapement, which is an important link that has not been found in the transition from Greece to medieval European clocks and watches. Therefore, it is very likely that the astronomical clocks of the Tang and Song Dynasties in China are the direct ancestors of European astronomical clocks. The idea that clocks and watches were introduced to China from the West in the past is really ignoring our ancestors.

    Second, in order to mobilize all forces to serve socialist construction, we must explore all aspects of potential, including all the knowledge and methods that the working people of our country have already mastered to prevent and treat diseases, increase production, and reduce natural disasters. In medicine, Western medicine is widely learning from traditional Chinese medicine and Chinese herbal medicine. For example, the use of ancient effective prescriptions to treat type B encephalitis has achieved some results; the treatment of internal hemorrhoids has also achieved good results. This makes us feel the preciousness of ancient scientific heritage even more. There are thousands of kinds of traditional Chinese medicine books. If they are systematically sorted out and analyzed, there are many prescriptions and medicines that can be handed over to research institutions for experimental research. The development of Chinese agriculture has a history of more than three thousand years. Since the Han Dynasty, many valuable experiences of farmers have been included in agricultural books, which can be used to guide agricultural production. However, many valuable experiences passed down by ancient old farmers have not yet been paid attention to by some cadres of agricultural production cooperatives. When the National People's Congress was held last month, Li Chenggui, a representative from Hunan Province, spoke at the meeting about the promotion of fine varieties. He said that Liling County in Hunan Province transferred a batch of early japonica rice from the Northeast, which was originally a fine variety, and it was successfully trial-planted in the lake area of ​​Hunan Province in 1955. But is the soil in the hilly area suitable? Careful consideration was not given in advance. Under the call of layers, they promoted more than 7,000 mu in their county in one breath, and their cooperative also planted 64 mu... It is estimated that there will be a loss in production. Agricultural products are strictly restricted by region. The high mountains are different from the plains, and the climate and soil in the north and south are also different. The varieties suitable for this place may not be suitable for another place. Jia Sixie's "Qi Min Yao Shu" in the Northern Wei Dynasty has already mentioned that "Bingzhou peas cross Jingxing to the east, and Shandong millet enters Huguan Shangdang, and the seedlings are not beautiful." In May of this year, Academician Tsitsin of the Soviet Union came to Beijing to participate in our country's agricultural science development planning work. He repeatedly emphasized that China should establish variety testing institutions. He advocated that more than 1,000 experimental areas should be set up across the country. Because the climate and soil conditions are different in each place, the varieties used should also be different. He said that only in this way can good results be obtained in the short term. From this, we can know that the theory in Jia Sixie's agricultural book 1,500 years ago is worthy of attention by our agricultural production staff.

    Third, the study of the history of natural sciences in China will invisibly extend the scope to the history of science in our neighboring countries, and even the history of world science, thereby helping to promote patriotism and internationalism. For example, if we study the history of mathematics or astronomy in China, we cannot but talk about the history of mathematics and astronomy in India or Japan, and even the history of mathematics and astronomy in Egypt and Greece. Science is international. Since history, various ethnic groups have always exchanged cultural exchanges. The discovery of a skill, the acquisition of a knowledge, such as the manufacture of silk and porcelain, the application of "zero" in mathematics, and the compilation of calendars in astronomy, are always passed on from generation to generation. In the beginning, it would take hundreds of years, but recently it can become popular all over the world in decades or years. The birthplace of many scientific knowledge in ancient times is not easy to investigate clearly. For example, in astronomy, China has twenty-eight constellations, and India and Arabia also have twenty-eight constellations. Among the twenty-eight constellations in China and India, there are nine constellations with the same distance star. Although the distance stars are different, there are eleven constellations in the same constellation, and only eight constellations whose distance stars do not belong to the same constellation. Among the twenty-eight constellations in Arabia, thirteen are identical to those in China. From this, we can know that the twenty-eight constellations in India, Arabia, and China are from the same source. China already had twenty-eight constellations in the Qin Shihuang era, and the twenty-eight constellations in India also originated very early. This proves that in the Qin Dynasty, before our country and India had formal exchanges in history, our science had already exchanged information. After the Han Dynasty, the scientific exchanges between our country and India and Arabia became closer. There are astronomers with biographies in history. In the Tang Dynasty, there was Qutan Ada, an Indian, who wrote Jiugui Lv; in the Yuan Dynasty, there was Zhalu Madin, a Westerner, who wrote the Perpetual Calendar. At the same time as Zhalu Madin, that is, in the era of Yuan Shizu, two Chinese astronomers went to the Ilkhanate, in the present-day Azerbaijan region of the Soviet Union, and participated in the construction of the astronomical observatory. These are enough to prove that for two thousand years, our country has been exchanging astronomy with India and Arabia. Moreover, not only astronomy has international exchanges in history, but also biology, chemistry, technology, agriculture, and medicine. Many of our agricultural products and herbs are passed down from foreign countries, such as alfalfa and grapes, which were introduced from the Western Regions as early as the Western Han Dynasty.

    In short, the excavation of ancient scientific heritage is very broad. Because on the one hand, it involves the socio-economic conditions at that time, and on the other hand, we must also know the development trends of science in other countries in the world at the same time. Our Chinese natural science workers deeply feel that their historical science cultivation is not enough if they want to excavate scientific heritage, and it can be said that there are very few people who master foreign languages ​​such as Arabic, Sanskrit, and Persian. We must have many historical scientists as the main force to open up the battlefield. At the same time, we also welcome foreign authoritative scholars such as Mr. Joseph Needham of England to participate in the study of Chinese scientific history. In particular, he gave up his own scientific career, which has been very successful, and came to study Chinese scientific history alone. His spirit of internationalism is worthy of our admiration. We welcome him to participate in our Hundred Schools of Thought.

    Finally, let's talk about "Hundred Schools of Thought". At the National People's Congress held in June, President Guo Moruo said in his report: "As far as I understand, the 'Hundred Schools of Thought' is different from the rise of various schools of thought and the 'Renaissance'. The Hundred Schools of Thought that we advocate, in more detail, is a socialist competition in various academic researches." In our people's team, whether it is materialism or idealism, all opinions can be expressed. Only in this way can we achieve a hundred schools of thought contend. Comrade Lu Dingyi said, "It is impossible not to make mistakes when thinking independently and carrying out complex creative labor." We are not afraid of making mistakes, but we are afraid of knowing mistakes and not correcting them. Only through criticism and self-criticism and unfolding debates can we correct mistakes. We must humbly accept others' criticisms when we are wrong, and we must gently correct others' mistakes. We must know that criticism is help, and we must not involve individuals in the criticism of facts; if we make emotional arguments for the sake of mutual criticism, then we will completely lose the meaning of the Hundred Schools of Thought.

    百家争鸣和发掘我国古代科学遗产
    竺可桢
      七月九日到十二日，中国科学院在北京召开中国自然科学史第一次讨论会，这正是我们国家在做十二年科学技术远景规划的时候，也正是我们科学工作人员应该努力争取于短期内在各个重要部门接近国际科学水平的时候。在这时候来开这样的会，可能有人提出疑问：若要我们在短期内接近国际水平，那我们必得迎头赶上，必得学习最先进的技术，应用最有效的科学方法，掌握最新式的工具，在这个基础上更深入一层来建立我们的新科学。若是在古纸堆中去找问题，到穷乡僻壤去总结经验，要想达到国际科学水平，不是南辕而北辙吗？我以为这样的想法是错误的。现代科学有了飞速的进步，我们不要永远落在后面，必须急起直追，这是不错的。但是这并不排除我们整理古代科学遗产，用古人的经验来丰富我们的科学知识。科学特点之一是其积累性，后人的发现常常是根据前人的成果的。没有哥白尼的地球绕太阳的学说，没有刻卜勒的关于行星运行的三条定律，也就不会有牛顿万有引力的学说。明朝李时珍的本草纲目是汇集了汉唐以来无数人所搜集考订的材料而成的。古语说得好：“江海不择细流，所以能成其大”。我国三、四千年以来，劳动人民的智慧是无穷的，而这类智慧却蕴藏在历代建造的器物和工程中，散布在口授秘方和谣谚中，更有不少是记述在经史子集中。陆定一同志在“百花齐放，百家争鸣”的报告里曾经说，“要广泛地学习知识，对古今中外，对朋友，对敌人，都要批判地学习”。他又说，“我们要广泛地学习知识。我国有很多的医学、农学、哲学、历史学、文学、戏剧、绘画、音乐等等的遗产，应该认真学习，批判地加以接受。这方面的工作不是做得太多，而是做得太少，不够认真，轻视民族遗产的思想还存在，在有些部门还是很严重”。批判地学习我国的文化和科学遗产，确是一件庄严的研究工作。据我个人非常粗浅的看法，这项研究应该在三方面作出贡献来。
    第一，我们要正确地估计中国民族在世界文化史上所占的地位。我们必须把中国古代科学上的贡献，以及中国在哲学、艺术和文学上的贡献一同估计进去。三十年以前，一个英国著名数学家、哲学家怀德海，对于中国古代艺术、文学、哲学和自然科学在世界文化史上的贡献有如下的估计：“我们知道中国的艺术、文学、人生哲学越多一点，我们越敬仰中国古代文化水准之高。数千年以来，中国不绝地有聪明渊博的学者毕生在钻研着。若使我们把历史时代所有人物的贡献积累起来算一笔总账，则中国的文化要算是世界上最宏大的。我们没有疑问，中国人具有探索自然科学的才能，但是他们在自然科学上的成就是微不足道的。而且若使中国孤立于世界，也没有理由可相信她对于科学会有什么成就”。怀德海这样无视中国古代科学的成就，这是由于我们自己没有把中国古代科学家的成就作适当的整理、了解和宣传，使古人辛勤所得的发现和发明在世界文化史上能得到它应该占有的地位。解放以前，生活在半封建半殖民地社会制度下的我国知识分子，对于古代科学和技术上的贡献很少加以注意。甚至于古代四大发明，即指南针、造纸、印刷术和火药的发明的重要性，除少数人以外，也被忽视了。要知道中国古代几个发现在世界文化史上的重要性，我们最好看一看恩格斯的“自然辩证法”，正如英国勃南尔教授所说的，恩格斯的“自然辩证法”是一本最好不过的近代自然科学史简编。恩格斯在他的“自然辩证法”一书里讲到历史上几项顶重要的发明时，提到纸、指南针、印刷术和燧发机，而这几项发明统是在中世纪末期从中国传到欧洲的。恩格斯在这本书的导言中说，“近代自然科学，就像整个近代史一样，是从这样一个伟大的时代算起，这个时代我们德国人由于当时我们所遭遇的民族灾难而称之为宗教改革，法国人称之为文艺复兴”。欧洲文艺复兴之所以发生在十五世纪决非偶然的事。欧洲在十五世纪中叶以前，书籍全是手抄本，但是在十五世纪后半叶五十年中，欧洲的书籍印刷了二百万册之多。印刷术的普及知识影响之广是难以估计的。国际自然科学史期刊的主笔乔治·沙顿在他的近著“文艺复兴时代对于古代科学的体会”一书中，就把欧洲文艺复兴从1450年即欧洲开始印刷书籍这个年代算起。所以若我们把中国历史上纸和印刷术的发现，作为两个划时代的伟大发现，可说是当之而无愧的。恩格斯讲到文艺复兴时代时又说：“旧的世界的界限被打破了，只是这时候才真正发现了地球，奠定了以后的世界贸易以及从手工业过渡到工场手工业之基础，而工场手工业又是近代大工业的出发点”。打破了旧世界界限的就是1492年哥伦布发现了新大陆。但是如果指南针没有在十二、三世纪时代传入欧洲，哥伦布的发现新大陆是很成问题的。因为在指南针没有传入欧洲以前，葡萄牙、西班牙和意大利的水手总不敢远离地中海。就是在哥伦布第一次横渡大西洋的时候，他所计算的距离和预期达到的目的同实际也是完全不符的。指南针在哥伦布手里是一种“法宝”，使他有勇气完成他的使命。这可以说是中国古代对于欧洲文艺复兴的又一个大贡献。
    印刷术和指南针是中国早已驰名世界的发现，但是我们古代在技术上的发现传布到全世界的远不止于此。英国剑桥大学李约瑟博士在他的“中国科学技术史”第一卷里，说到从东汉到清代一千八百年中，从中国传入欧洲的技术，他一口气就列举了二十六个，而中国对传到欧洲的技术可还没摸到底。我很惭愧地承认对于这二十六个发明传入欧洲的事实，大多数总是一无所知。最近清华大学副校长刘仙洲和李约瑟博士先后介绍了北宋苏颂“新仪象法要”书中所叙述的天文钟，据英国专门研究钟表史的专家普拉斯说，在十九世纪中叶以前，钟表是世界上最复杂的机器。所以要研究近代复杂机器的来源，首先要研究钟表的来源。从1500年到现在，西洋钟表的发展史是很清楚的，但是在1500年以前的历史可摸不清了，只能说他是从上古埃及、希腊的日晷、铜壶滴漏这类古老方法演变而来的。近二十年的研究，更增加了解释的困难，因为新的知识弄明白了，最初欧洲的钟，已经是一架极复杂的机器，报时报刻是它附带的作用，主要作用是昼夜星象的轮回。这样说来，欧洲十四、五世纪钟的形式很类似苏颂所制的天文钟。所不同的是苏颂的天文钟可以上溯到北宋初年司天监张思训的仪器和唐代开元时一行和梁令瓒所制的仪器，但是在欧洲就没有这个线索可寻。更重要的，是苏颂的装置已经具备一个像擒纵器似的齿轮系统，而这正是从希腊过渡到欧洲中世纪钟表中间所没有发现的一个重要环节。所以很可能中国唐宋时代的天文钟，就是欧洲天文钟的嫡系祖先。从前我们以为钟表是西洋传入中国的想法，真是数典忘祖了。
    第二，为了动员一切力量为社会主义建设服务，我们必须发掘各方面的潜力，包括古代我国劳动人民所已经掌握的防治疾病、增加生产以及减免天然灾害的一切知识和方法。在医药方面，西医已经广泛地在学习中医中药。如医治乙型脑炎用古代特效方单，已经取得若干成果；医疗内痔也有很好成绩。这使我们更觉得古代科学遗产的可贵。中医书籍有一千几百种之多，如果有系统地加以整理分析，则其中有不少方单、药物可以交给研究机关试验研究。中国农业的发展有三千多年的历史，从两汉以来，不少农民的宝贵经验已经收入农书中，很可以用来指导农业生产。但是有许多古代老农所传下来的宝贵经验，目前一些农业生产合作社的干部还没有加以注意。上月全国人民代表大会开会的时候，湖南省代表李呈桂在大会发言里讲了一桩关于推广优良品种的事。他说，湖南醴陵县从东北调来一批早粳，这本是一种优良品种，1955年在湖南省湖区也试种成功了。但在丘陵区土质是不是适合呢？事先没有作周密的考虑。在层层号召之下，一口气他们县里就推广了七千多亩，他们社也种了六十四亩……估计要受到减产的损失。农业产品受地区限制很严，高山和平地既不相同，南北的气候土壤也有差异，这个地方相宜的品种不一定适合于另一地方。北魏贾思勰所著“齐民要术”里已经提到，“并州豌豆度井陉而东，山东谷子入壶关上党，苗而不秀”。今年五月间，苏联齐津院士来北京参加我国的农业科学远景规划工作。他再三强调，中国应该成立品种试验机构。他主张在全国应该设立一千个以上的试验区。因为各地方气候土壤情形不同，所用品种也应有别。他说，惟有这样，才能在短期内得到良好结果。从此可以知道，一千五百年以前，贾思勰农书里的学说是值得我们农业生产工作人员注意的。
    第三，研究中国自然科学史，无形中会把范围推广到我们毗邻各国的科学史，甚至于世界科学史，因之有助于发扬爱国主义和国际主义。如我们研究中国的数学史或是天文史，就不能不连带讲到印度或日本的数学天文史，甚至于埃及、希腊的数学天文史。科学本是国际性的，自有历史以来，各民族间在文化上一直互通有无，一种技能的发现，一种知识的获得，如蚕丝、磁器的制造，数学上“零”的应用，天文上历法的编制，总是辗转传授。初则要几百年，近来则几十年或几年之间就可以风行全球。古代有许多科学上的知识的发源地，不容易查考清楚。如天文上，中国有二十八宿，印度和阿拉伯也有二十八宿。中国和印度二十八宿中，距星相同的有九宿。距星虽然不同，但是在同一个星座里的有十一宿，距星之不隶属于同一星座的只有八宿。阿拉伯的二十八宿中，有十三宿和中国的全同。从此可知，印度、阿拉伯和中国的二十八宿同出一源。中国在秦始皇时代，已经有二十八宿，印度的二十八宿也起源很早，这证明了在秦朝时候，在历史上我国和印度还没有正式交往以前，我们的科学已经互通声息了。两汉以后，我国和印度、阿拉伯在科学上的交流更为密切。历史上有传记的天文家，唐代有瞿昙恶达，是印度人，著有九轨律；元代有札鲁马丁，是西域人，著有万年历。和札鲁马丁同时，即在元世祖时代，曾经有两位中国天文家到伊儿汗国，在现在苏联的阿塞拜疆地方，参加了建立天文台的工作。这些都足以证明，两千年以来，我国同印度、阿拉伯在天文学上是一直有交流的。而且不仅天文学在历史上有国际交流，生物、化学、工艺、农业、医药也是这样。我们有许多农产品和药草都传自外国，如苜蓿、葡萄，在西汉时就已经从西域引入。
    总之发掘古代科学遗产，方面是很广的。因为它一方面牵涉到当时的社会经济状况，一方面又必须知道同时代世界其他各国科学发展趋向。我们中国自然科学工作者要想发掘科学遗产，深深地感觉到历史科学的修养不够，掌握外国语如阿拉伯文、梵文、波斯文的，可以说是绝无仅有。必得有许多历史科学家作为主力军来开辟阵地。同时我们对于外国的权威学者如英国的李约瑟先生参加研究中国科学史也是无任欢迎的。尤其他放弃了本人已经很有成就的本行科学，单身匹马地来进行中国科学史的研究，他的国际主义的精神是值得我们钦佩的。我们欢迎他参加我们的百家争鸣。
    最后讲到“百家争鸣”。在六月份召开的全国人民代表大会会议上，郭沫若院长报告中曾经说：“‘百家争鸣’据我所了解，既不同于诸子蜂起，也不同于‘文艺复兴’。我们所主张的百家争鸣，更详细地说，就是在各种学术研究中的社会主义竞赛。”在我们人民队伍中，无论是唯物、唯心，一切见解都能发表，惟有这样才能做到百家争鸣。陆定一同志说，“独立思考，进行复杂的创造性的劳动，完全不犯错误是不可能的”。不怕犯错误，只怕知道错误而不改。惟有批评和自我批评，展开争论，才能改正错误。自己有不是的地方要虚心地接受人家的批评，别人有不对的地方要婉转地予以纠正。要知道批评就是帮助，批评事实不要牵连到个人身上去；如果为了互相批评而致闹意气，那就完全失掉了百家争鸣的意义。
