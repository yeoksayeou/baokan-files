The Second National Chinese Painting Exhibition is scheduled to open on July 10th at the Chinese Artists Association Exhibition Hall in the capital.

Since the Ministry of Culture and the Chinese Artists Association issued a notice in January soliciting submissions for the Chinese Painting Exhibition, they have successively received over 3,500 works from Chinese painting artists, branches of the Artists Association, and cultural bureaus of various provinces and cities across the country. After careful evaluation by the exhibition's selection committee, a total of 944 works were selected, representing over 760 artists, including nationally renowned veteran painters, as well as young and amateur painters. These works are all recent creations.

The submissions not only increased more than fourfold compared to the First National Chinese Painting Exhibition, but also showed a significant improvement in artistic quality. Many Chinese painting artists enthusiastically depicted the new atmosphere of the motherland's construction and the increasingly socialist spirit of the working people in their works. The forms of expression and techniques have also been developed on the traditional style of national painting, and preliminary creations and attempts have been made to adapt to the needs of expressing new things. Many painters depicted the landscape of the motherland today with a new feeling, and many excellent flower and bird paintings reflected new aspects of life.

Due to the limitations of the venue, only a portion of the selected works will be exhibited in Beijing this time, and all the works will be exhibited in Shanghai in August.

    第二届全国国画展览会即将开幕
    本报讯　“第二届全国国画展览会”七月十日起，将在首都中国美术家协会展览馆展出。
    今年一月，文化部和中国美术家协会发出征集国画展览作品的通知以后，就陆续收到全国各地国画家、美协分会和各省市文化局寄来的作品共三千五百余件。经过展览会的评选委员会认真评选，共选出作品九百四十四件，包括作者七百六十余人，其中有全国知名的老画家，也有青年画家和业余画家，这些作品都是他们近年来的新作。
    这次应征的作品，不但在数量上比第一届全国国画展览会增加了四倍以上，而且在艺术质量上也有显著的提高。不少的国画家在作品中热情地描绘了祖国在建设中的新气象和劳动人民日益成长的社会主义的精神面貌。作品的表现形式和表现技巧也在民族绘画的传统风格上有所发扬，并在适应表现新事物的需要上有了初步的创造和尝试。有不少画家以新的感觉描写了今天祖国的河山风景，也有不少优秀的花鸟画反映出新的生活情趣。
    由于会场的限制，这次在北京展出的仅是入选作品中的一部分，全部作品将于八月间在上海展出。
