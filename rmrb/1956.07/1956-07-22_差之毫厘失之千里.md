"A Hair's Breadth Difference, A Thousand Miles Lost"
To the Editor:

　　In Henan Province, there is Qinyang County and also Biyang County. Qinyang is in the north of Henan, and Biyang is in the south of Henan. The characters Qin (沁) and Bi (泌) differ by only one stroke, but the two places are more than a thousand miles apart. Some careless people often confuse the two characters, resulting in "a hair's breadth difference, a thousand miles lost," not only wasting a lot of manpower and material resources, but also causing losses in work.

　　For example, the Tianshui City Public Security Bureau sent several documents to the Qinyang Public Security Bureau on January 26th of this year, but because the character Qin (沁) was mistakenly written as Bi (泌), it was already mid-June when the Qinyang Public Security Bureau received the documents forwarded from Biyang. Another example is that the Tongxian County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Hebei sent several important documents to the Qinyang Public Security Bureau on April 19th of this year, but mistakenly sent them to Biyang. Two months later, the Qinyang Public Security Bureau received this batch of documents forwarded from Biyang. Not long ago, a comrade from a public security organ in Xi'an originally wanted to go to Qinyang Middle School to investigate materials, but he took a letter of introduction addressed to Biyang Middle School and ended up going to Biyang. Because of this, how much did this comrade waste in travel, spend in money, and lose in time!

　　We conducted a statistic from mid-April to mid-June and found that there were more than 100 investigation materials and certificates that should have been sent to Biyang but were mistakenly sent to Qinyang; about 60 items that should have been sent to Qinyang but were mistakenly sent to Biyang. Among the people sent from various places to Qinyang and Biyang to investigate materials, 15 people mistakenly went to Biyang; more than 20 people mistakenly came to Qinyang. Public security organs in various places issued incorrect migration certificates to more than 30 people who moved to Qinyang and Biyang.

　　We hope that agencies, organizations, and factory and mining enterprises in various places will pay attention to the difference between the characters Qin (沁) and Bi (泌), and avoid making these completely avoidable mistakes again.

### “差之毫厘失之千里”

    “差之毫厘失之千里”编辑同志：
    河南省有个沁阳县还有一个泌阳县，沁阳在河南北部，泌阳在河南南部，沁泌二字只有一笔之差，而两地相距却有一千多里。有些粗心大意的人们，往往把二字弄错，以致常常“差之毫厘，失之千里”，不但使人力物力有很大浪费，并且造成工作上的损失。
    如天水市公安局在今年一月二十六日给沁阳公安局寄来几份材料，因为把沁字错写成泌字，等到沁阳公安局接到从泌阳转来的材料时，已经是六月中旬了。又如中共河北通县县委会在今年四月十九日寄给沁阳公安局几份重要的材料，结果错寄到泌阳去了，两个月后，沁阳公安局才收到从泌阳转来的这批材料。不久以前，西安市一个公安机关一位同志，本来要到沁阳中学调查材料，但是他却拿着一封开给泌阳中学的介绍信，结果跑到泌阳去了。因为这样，这位同志枉跑了多少路，多化了多少钱，浪费了多少时间啊！
    我们从四月中旬到六月中旬作了一次统计，各地应寄泌阳而错寄到沁阳的调查材料和证明材料有一百余件；应寄沁阳而错寄到泌阳的约有六十余件。各地派往沁阳和泌阳调查材料的人，错跑到泌阳去的有十五人；错来到沁阳的有二十余人。各地公安机关给迁往沁阳和泌阳的三十多个人开错了迁移证。
    我们希望各地机关、团体、和厂矿企业部门，注意沁、泌二字的差别，不要再发生这类完全可以避免的错误。
