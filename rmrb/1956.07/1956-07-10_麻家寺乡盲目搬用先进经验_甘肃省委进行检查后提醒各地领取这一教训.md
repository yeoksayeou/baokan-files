Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, 8th. Majiasi Township blindly copied advanced experience, failing to increase production and instead facing reduced yields.

The Rural Work Department of the Gansu Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party recently inspected the situation in Gaolan County's Majiasi Township, where blindly changing summer crops to autumn crops and inappropriately promoting spring irrigation led to crop reduction throughout the township. It believes that this lesson is worth remembering by agricultural producers' cooperatives in all localities.

Majiasi Township is a high-altitude, cold region. In the past, farmers here mainly planted summer crops such as wheat and beans, which accounted for 60% to 70% of the total area of the township. Among them, wheat's average yield was over 200 jin per mu, and harvests were relatively stable. In recent years, the township has also promoted a three-crop rotation system (i.e., beans-wheat-millet/potatoes) based on local natural conditions and past farmer experience, with yields generally higher than in the past.

Starting this year, in order to complete the task of increasing production, the township cadres ignored the local natural characteristics and the opinions of the masses, blindly copying the experience of other regions, changing summer crops to autumn crops, reducing the original summer planting area from two-thirds to one-third, and expanding the autumn planting area to two-thirds. The result of this change was not only a failure to achieve the goal of increasing production, but also the destruction of the original, more reasonable rotation system, seriously affecting the second half of the year's production. For example, in the past, planting wheat on bean stubble land yielded 300 jin per mu, but changing to planting wheat on autumn stubble land will reduce the yield by one-third compared to bean stubble land. At the same time, because autumn crops mature late, farmers cannot plow the land during the hot season, which also affects increased production. In addition, it has created a surplus of labor and animal power in the summer and a shortage of labor in the autumn.

This township has more rain and snow in autumn and winter, and the masses also have a habit of winter irrigation, so the land is generally full of moisture in the spring and does not require spring irrigation. The local masses have a saying: "If spring water flows into the ditch, nine out of ten years will be a bad harvest." However, the township's leading cadres disregarded these actual conditions and forced the masses to irrigate with spring water, resulting in soil compaction and affecting the planting time. Now, the wheat irrigated with spring water is growing yellow and sparse, with few tillers, while the wheat not irrigated with spring water is growing vigorously. Due to spring irrigation, the township also wasted more than 9,200 units of labor and more than 1,900 units of animal power.

### 麻家寺乡盲目搬用先进经验  甘肃省委进行检查后提醒各地领取这一教训

    麻家寺乡盲目搬用先进经验
    甘肃省委进行检查后提醒各地领取这一教训
    新华社兰州8日电　麻家寺乡盲目搬用先进经验，增产不成，反而要减产。
    中共甘肃省委农村工作部，最近检查了皋兰县麻家寺乡盲目的把夏田作物改为秋田作物和不适宜的推广春灌致使全乡庄稼将要减产的情况，认为这一教训值得各地农业生产合作社深为记取。
    麻家寺乡是一个高寒地区。过去这里农民每年播种以麦、豆为主的夏田作物，面积占到全乡总面积的60％到70％。其中如小麦每亩平均产量在二百斤以上，而且收成比较稳定。近几年来，该乡又根据当地自然条件和过去农民的经验，推广以夏田为主的三样轮作制（即豆—麦—糜谷、马铃薯），产量一般也比过去提高了。
    今年开始，这个乡的干部为了完成增产任务，却忽视了当地自然特点并不顾群众的意见，盲目的搬用别的地区的经验，改夏田作物为秋田作物，将原来夏田播种面积由三分之二缩小到三分之一，秋田面积扩大到三分之二。这样改种的结果，不仅没有达到增产的目的，还破坏了原来较合理的轮作制度，严重影响到下半年的生产。如过去豆槎地播种小麦，每亩产量达到三百斤，改成秋槎地播种小麦后，产量就会比豆槎地减少三分之一。同时，因为秋田成熟晚，农民不能在伏天翻地，这也影响到增产。另外，还造成了夏季劳力畜力过剩和秋季劳力又不足的困难。
    这个乡秋冬雨雪较多，群众也有冬灌的习惯，因此一般春季地墒饱满，不需要春灌。当地群众有“春水淌开沟，十年九不收”的说法。但乡的领导干部不顾这些实际情况，硬叫群众灌春水，结果是土地板结、影响播种时间。现在灌了春水的小麦，长得黄萎、稀疏，分蘖少，没有灌春水的小麦倒生长茁壮。由于灌春水，全乡还浪费劳力九千二百多个，畜力一千九百多个。
