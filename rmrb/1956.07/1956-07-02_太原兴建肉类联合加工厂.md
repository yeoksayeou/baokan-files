    Taiyuan to Build Joint Meat Processing Plant
    (Our report) A new, semi-automated joint meat processing plant and a cold storage facility with a frozen storage capacity of 6,500 tons will begin construction on July 10th in the southern suburbs of Taiyuan.
    This joint meat processing plant will be able to slaughter 1,000 pigs, 50 cattle, and 300 sheep per day. In addition to slaughtering meat for people's consumption and export, the processing plant will have specialized workshops to process by-products of pigs, cattle, and sheep. For example, some heads, trotters, offal, and minced meat will be made into cooked meat or sausages for the market, and intestines will be processed into sausage casings for export.
    In addition to freezing and storing pork, beef, and mutton, the cold storage facility can also store fish, eggs, fruits, vegetables, and medicines that need to be refrigerated. After the factory is completed, Taiyuan will be able to basically overcome the problems of egg spoilage and fruit rot, and fresh vegetables will also be readily available in the market.

    太原兴建肉类联合加工厂
    本报讯　一座新型的、半自动化的肉类联合加工厂和有六千五百吨冷冻储藏能力的冷库，将于七月十日在太原市南郊动工兴建。
    这个肉类联合加工厂每日能屠宰一千头猪，五十头牛，三百只羊，这个加工厂除屠宰肉食供应人民食用和出口以外，对猪牛羊的副产品都有专门车间进行加工。如一部分头、蹄、上下水、碎肉将制成熟肉或香肠供应市场，肠子将加工成可供出口的肠衣。
    冷库除冷冻和存放猪、牛、羊肉外，还可以存放鱼类、蛋品、水果、蔬菜和需要冷藏的药品。这个工厂建成后，太原市可以基本上克服蛋臭、水果烂的现象，在市场上也可以经常买到新鲜蔬菜。（江维洲）
