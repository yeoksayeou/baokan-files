Xinhua News Agency, 30th, New York dispatch: According to US press reports, US industrial production is continuing to decline.

The official US industrial production index for May was announced as 142 (with the average for 1947-49 as 100), while the final confirmed index for April was 143. According to the "Economic Review" in June, based on surveys conducted in May, not since the beginning of 1954 have so many companies cut production as in recent months. Compared to the peak production levels of 1955, automobile production has decreased by 28%, television production by 41%, radio production by 40%, clothing by 8%, and metal products by 6%.

In analyzing the reasons for the production decline, many US newspapers believe that it is a result of the disconnect between production and consumption. The June issue of "U.S. News & World Report" magazine stated that unsold inventory in the manufacturing sector has increased to $47.9 billion, an increase of $4 billion compared to June 1955. Total industrial and commercial inventory is worth over $83 billion, an increase of over $6 billion compared to the middle of last year, reaching an unprecedented peak. Many enterprises, seeing poor sales of their products, are therefore producing on a smaller scale.

An Associated Press dispatch on June 26th discussed the current situation of the entire US economy. The dispatch stated that the US economy was "strong" at the beginning of the year, showed "hesitation" in the spring, and government economists predicted that there would be a "period of quiet" in the summer, with production continuing to decline. The dispatch said that overall, the current economic situation in the United States has both good and bad aspects. The "pessimistic" side is: industrial production is decreasing, housing construction is decreasing, workers' wages have declined somewhat, farmers' incomes are declining, and stock market prices have been falling for a long time, etc. The dispatch believes that the "optimistic" side is: corporate investment is increasing, and employment and personal income remain at relatively high levels. US Secretary of Commerce Weeks has even announced that in an election year, the Republican government will try every means to "ensure that the decline in business activity does not harm the Republican Party's prospects."

    美国经济走下坡路
    工业继续减产　存货不断增加
    新华社30日讯　纽约消息：据美国报刊报道，美国工业生产在继续下跌。
    美国官方宣布的五月份的工业生产指数为142（以1947—49年的平均数为一百），四月份最后确定的指数是143。据六月份的“经济评论”报道，根据五月份作的调查，自从1954年年初以来，没有像最近几个月那样有这样多的公司在削减生产。同1955年的生产最高水平相比较，汽车工业的生产已经减少了28％，电视机生产减少了41％，无线电减少了40％，衣服减少了8％，金属制品减少了6％。
    在分析生产下跌的原因的时候，美国许多报刊都认为，这是生产和消费脱节的结果。六月份一期的“美国新闻与世界报道”杂志说，目前在制造业部门中，卖不出去的存货已经增加到479亿美元，比1955年6月增加了四十亿美元。工商业的全部存货共值八百三十多亿美元，比去年年中增加了六十多亿美元，达到了空前未有的高峰。许多企业看到产品销路不佳，因此都在缩小的规模上进行生产。
    美联社在六月二十六日的一条消息中谈到了美国整个经济的目前形势。消息说，美国经济在今年开年的时候是“坚挺”的，在春季就表现了“犹豫”，政府的经济学家们预料，在夏季将会出现“沉寂时期”，生产将继续下跌。消息说，就全面而言，目前美国的经济情况有好有坏。“悲观”的一面是：工业生产减少，住房建筑减少、工人工资有一些下跌、农民收入下跌以及股票市场价格长期下跌等等。消息认为“乐观”的一面是：企业投资在增加、就业人数和个人收入仍然维持在相当高的水平上。美国商务部长威克斯并且已经宣布，在竞选的年头，共和党政府将要想尽办法“使企业活动下降的程度不致于损害共和党的前景”。
