Xinhua News Agency, Haikou, 16th: Yesterday, thirty-seven language experts and staff members departed from Haikou on a special train to the Hainan Li and Miao Autonomous Prefecture. Within this year, they will comprehensively investigate the distribution and differences of Li dialects, select a basic dialect and standard pronunciation, and propose a preliminary draft of a Li writing system. Simultaneously, they will investigate the local Miao language to provide materials for creating a Miao writing system in our country. They are the staff of the Hainan Branch of the First Working Team for Minority Language Investigation of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, including the first group of seventeen Li language workers. These Li cadres, after undergoing half a year of specialized training in Beijing, have preliminarily learned the basic knowledge of language work and can now record and initially organize linguistic data of their own ethnic group.
