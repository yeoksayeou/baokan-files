Xinhua News Agency, London, 16th: Calls for military spending cuts are rising in Britain. Liberal Party leader Clement Davies suggested on July 14 that the government should cut 500 million pounds from the annual military expenditure of 1.5 billion pounds, while increasing British industrial production to cope with the economic competition facing Britain.

Davies said: "Russia will not wage a military war against the world, but an economic war. It is waging such a war now. And we are impoverishing and weakening ourselves with obsolete, useless armaments..."

He said that, on the contrary, Britain's arms burden is heavier than that of the United States. He believes that Britain should first cut its armaments, although "this issue must be agreed upon with other countries that make up the North Atlantic Treaty Organization."

Davies also said that if Britain simultaneously stopped implementing compulsory military service, thereby putting thousands of young people into industrial production, Britain's inflation would almost be eliminated overnight.

The Associated Press, in reporting the suggestion of the Liberal Party leader, who often supports government policies, pointed out that the British government is under pressure to drastically reduce military personnel and expenses. Government ministers are also talking about cutting military spending by 35%.

Xinhua News Agency, 16th: The British "Daily Express" published an article on July 13 calling for a large reduction in military spending.

The article said: "...The news is good. The prospect of lasting peace is now better than it has been for many years. So why are so many people restless with discontent? Why is the government so unpopular?

"Look at the chart next door, and you will get your answer. Rising prices are lightening every wage packet and draining the money from every purse.

"There is only one way to quickly fix the situation -- drastically cut government spending. "Military spending should be drastically cut first.

"...So, what happens next?

"First, reduce obligations. Stop wasting troops in Germany and Korea.

"Second, end conscription.

"Third, use the strength to run businesses."

The article pointed out that Britain's annual "defense" expenditure is about 1.5 billion pounds. It is possible to cut 500 million pounds from this huge number without affecting "defense."

The "Daily Express" said: This will bring endless benefits to the stability of the country and the welfare of every citizen.

    英国内要求削减军费呼声高涨
    自由党领袖建议减少五亿镑军事开支
    “每日快报”指出削减军费才能稳定局面
    新华社16日讯　伦敦消息：英国自由党领袖克莱门特·戴维斯在七月十四日提出建议，要求政府从每年十五亿英镑的军费开支中削减五亿英镑，同时提高英国的工业生产，来应付英国面临的经济竞争。
    戴维斯说：“俄国将对世界发动的并不是军事战争而是经济战争。它现在正在进行这样的战争。而我们正在因为过时的、无用的军备而使我们自己贫穷和柔弱……。”
    他说，相反地说来，英国的军备负担比美国还要沉重。他认为英国应该首先裁减军备，尽管关于“这个问题必须同组成北大西洋公约组织的其他国家取得一致的意见”。
    戴维斯又说，如果英国同时停止实行义务兵役制，从而把成千的年轻人放到工业生产上去的话，英国的通货膨胀就几乎会在一夜之间消除掉。
    美联社在报道这位常常是支持政府政策的自由党领袖的建议时指出，英国政府正在受到压力，要它大大削减军事方面的人员和费用。政府大臣们也正在谈论削减军费开支35％这样一个数目。
    新华社16日讯　英国“每日快报”七月十三日发表的一篇文章要求大大削减军费。
    这篇文章说：“……消息是好的。持久和平的前景现在比过去许多年要好。那末，为什么这样多的人由于有不满情绪而急躁呢？政府为什么这样不得人心呢？
    “看一下隔壁一行的图表，你就可以得到你的答案。上涨的物价减轻了每一个工资袋，耗尽了每一个钱袋里的钱。
    “要很快地把局面整顿好的办法只有一个——大大削减政府的开支。“首先应该大大削减军费。
    “……那末，以后怎么办呢？
    “第一，减少义务。停止在德国和朝鲜浪费军队。
    “第二，结束征兵。
    “第三，把力量用来经营事业。”
    这篇文章指出，英国每年的“防御”费用是十五亿英镑左右。有可能从这个巨大的数字削减五亿英镑而不至于影响“防务”。
    “每日快报”说：这样将给这个国家的稳定和每一个公民的福利带来无穷的好处。
