    Rescuing National Music
    Zha Yiping

    In the past few years, under the guidance of the Party and the government's call to promote the fine traditions of the nation and attach importance to national heritage, China's music workers have done a great deal of work in the field of national music and have achieved certain results. Through collection and arrangement, the Institute of National Music of the Central Conservatory of Music has collected more than 30,000 folk songs and folk music pieces, and has preliminarily researched some musical pieces from the Six Dynasties, Tang Dynasty, and Song Dynasty. Through observation, performances, learning, and absorption, the national music and singing of many performance organizations have won the love of the broad masses, and national music has been developed and improved.

    I have been engaged in amateur ancient music activities and research for many years. At the end of the year before last, I was invited by the Chinese Musicians Association to participate in the national tour performance of folk classics in ten major cities across the country. The tour lasted two months and had an audience of 100,000 people. Cultural circles in various places believed that this performance conducted profound patriotic education for the broad masses and aroused everyone's attention to the heritage of national music. This year, I led a group to fifteen provinces, cities, and counties across the country to collect guqin music, came into contact with some issues in the development of national music, and put them forward for your comments and support.

    The following problems exist in national music:

    First, the issue of attention from all parties. National music has been neglected for a long time. Before the庚子 year (1900), China only had national music. After the 庚子 year, Western music dominated intellectuals for more than 30 years. After the May Fourth Movement, Xiao Youmei, Zhao Yuanren, Huang Zi, and others introduced Western music, and China had music academies. At that time, although there were requirements to engage in national music at the same time, it was not explored from the folk but relied on a few old intellectuals. Their theoretical and technical levels were not very high, and most of them could not take root in music academies. As a result, national music was neglected, and Western music still dominated. From the War of Resistance Against Japan to the War of Liberation, music workers under the leadership of the Party approached the masses in the battles, and many songs full of national style emerged. After the national liberation, although the Party and the government emphasized the need to inherit and develop the heritage of national music, because musicians did not conduct in-depth research on the heritage of national music, they were unable to inherit the tradition of national music and achieve due achievements in creation and singing.

    Creators with high musical levels subjectively strive for national forms, and there are also a large number of collected materials for them to adopt. However, the materials are written in simple notation, which is difficult to be accurate and not unified, and they have no confidence in them. In addition, most of the adapters adapt the tunes to suit Western counterpoint and harmony, and the national style is removed.

    Music schools and even performance units have absorbed many folk artists, but their cultural level is low and they are not good at teaching. As a result, those who learn from them cannot achieve due achievements and do not help promote the heritage of national music.

    Secondly, there is the issue of research work. The only national music research institution is the Institute of National Music of the Central Conservatory of Music. In 1953, it moved to a pitifully small house in the suburbs of Beijing. Although it is directly led by the Ministry of Culture, it has to undertake the collection, arrangement, and research of various national music materials, answer questions from all parties, explore, arrange, and research folk and classical music, receive foreign guests, and research and improve musical instruments. Because of the small number of people and heavy workload, and the lack of funds, it is difficult to achieve results.

    After a large number of members of Western music ensembles transferred to local opera troupes, many people were able to learn modestly and achieved very good results, such as Shandong Lü Opera. However, some people were unable to learn modestly, resulting in many local opera types being changed to Western music in the reform of drama, and the national style in drama music was also damaged.

    In addition, I heard that last year Beijing organized forces to compile some music textbooks for primary and secondary schools. The content only consisted of translating some original songs and some songs from the Soviet Union and People's Democratic countries. It did not introduce any common knowledge of national music. Fortunately, it was discovered and corrected by the Chinese Musicians Association after being sent there.

    The music counseling agencies in many places deliberately do not allow folk national music groups to perform, and do not allow their performances to meet the masses. The excuse is that they are afraid that the content is unhealthy or reactionary, but in reality, they are excluding national music. Some are also afraid that after being welcomed by the masses, they will ask the public for subsidies. This kind of thinking and practice should be criticized.

    There is also a problem. Traditional fixed-pitch national musical instruments, such as xiao and flute, have a fixed temperament. Even if there is a difference, it is only about half a temperament, which is necessary for folk traditions and songs. However, in the past two years, the temperament in Beijing and Shanghai has been messed up. If this continues to spread, it will make it impossible for the vast number of farmers to set the tone for singing.

    There is more than one such example: There are elderly, poor, and sick senior intellectuals with good old knowledge who cannot be absorbed into the Research Institute for History and Literature or the Cultural Relics Management Committee to be taken care of. It is said that the reason is that although he is a famous guqin player, it is still inconvenient to let him be listed alongside other old gentlemen.

    Judging from the above situation, national music has become a problem that needs to be rescued! I suggest that the government urge the cultural and educational departments to take necessary measures to improve and reverse these situations.

    抢救民族音乐
    查夷平
    几年来，我国的音乐工作者，在党和政府要求发扬民族的优良传统和重视民族遗产的指示之下，在民族音乐方面做了不少的工作，并且得到了一定的成绩。通过收集整理，中央音乐学院民族音乐研究所收集的民间歌曲和民间音乐有三万首之多，并且初步地研究出来了一些六朝、唐代和宋代的乐曲；通过观摩、会演、学习和吸收，许多演出机构的民族音乐和歌唱都获得了广大群众的热爱，民族音乐得到了发展与提高。
    我作了多年的古乐业余活动和研究，在前年底因受中国音乐家协会的邀请，参加了民间古典巡回演出团在国内十大城市演出，历时两月，观众十万人，各地文化界都认为这次演出对广大群众进行了深刻的爱国主义教育，引起了大家对于民族音乐遗产的重视；今年又领导一个小组到国内十五个省市县从事古琴音乐的收集工作，接触到发展民族音乐中的一些问题，提出来，请大家给予指正，支持。
    民族音乐存在着下列一些问题：
    首先，是各方面的重视问题。民族音乐的被轻视已经很久了，在庚子以前，我国只有民族音乐。庚子以后，西洋音乐在知识分子中统治了三十多年。五四以后，萧友梅、赵元任、黄自等介绍了西洋音乐，我国才有音乐学院，那时虽有同时搞民族音乐的要求，但未向民间发掘，只依靠几个旧知识分子，他们的理论和技术水平都不很高，大多数不能在音乐学府扎好根，民族音乐就被轻视了，结果仍是由西洋音乐来统治。从抗日到解放战争中，党领导下的音乐工作者在战斗中接近了群众，曾出现过许多充满民族风格的歌曲。全国解放后，党和政府虽强调要继承与发展民族音乐遗产，由于音乐家对民族音乐遗产没有进行深入研究，所以在创作上演唱上都没有能够继承民族音乐传统，获得应有的成就。
    音乐水平很高的创作家主观上是力争民族形式的，也有大批收集来的素材供他们采取。但是素材是用简谱写的，难得正确，也不统一，他们对它们无信心；加上改编者多是改编曲调去适合西洋的对位和声，民族风格又去掉了。
    音乐院校以至演出单位吸收了不少的民间艺人，但他们的文化水平低，不善于教，结果向他们学的人，不能获得应有的成绩，无助于民族音乐遗产的发扬。
    其次，是关于研究工作问题。民族音乐的研究机构，仅仅只是中央音乐学院的民族音乐研究所，1953年迁到北京郊外一所小得可怜的房子里，虽由文化部直接领导，但要负担收集、整理、研究民族音乐各种资料，向各方面解答问题，发掘、整理、研究民间及古典乐曲，接待各国外宾，研究改良乐器，因人少事繁，且经费太少，很难作出成绩。
    大批搞西洋音乐的文工团员转业到各地方剧团后，许多人能够虚心学习，做出了很好的成绩，如山东吕戏，但也有些人不能虚心学习，结果使得许多地方剧种在戏剧改革中向西洋音乐改过去，戏剧音乐中的民族风格也遭到破坏。
    此外听说去年北京市组织力量编了一些中小学的音乐教材，内容只是把一些创作歌曲和一些苏联和人民民主国家的歌曲转译凑成，没有介绍一点民族音乐的常识。幸而送到中国音乐家协会被发现提出意见纠正了。
    许多地方的音乐辅导机关，故意不许民间的民族音乐团体出演，不让他们的演奏和群众见面。借口的理由是怕内容不健康或反动，实际是排斥民族音乐，也有的是怕受到群众欢迎之后来向公家要求补助。这种思想和做法是应该批评的。
    还有一个问题。传统的定音民族乐器，如箫、笛，是有定律的，即使相差也只有半律左右，这对于民间传统和歌是必要的。但是近两年来，北京和上海的已经乱了，蔓延下去，将使广大农民不能定调唱歌。
    有这样不止一个例子：有老年贫病的高级知识分子，旧学很好而不能被吸收到文史馆或文管会去受到照顾，据说原因是，他虽是有名的弹琴家，但还是不便让他和其他老先生们同列。
    从以上这些情况看来，民族音乐已经是一个需要抢救的问题了！我建议请政府督促文化和教育部门采取必要措施改善和扭转这些情况。（在第一届全国人民代表大会第三次会议上的发言）
