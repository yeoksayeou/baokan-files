    Cotton and Iron
    Hou Dailin
    “Which is heavier, a pound of cotton or a pound of iron?”
    “A pound of iron is heavier.” The primary school student answered without seemingly giving it a second thought.
    This answer, of course, can elicit a laugh, but upon careful reflection, it feels like his reasoning is correct.
    A pound of iron is just a small piece, while a pound of cotton is a big pile, even though the weight of iron and cotton is exactly the same. Thus, I came to realize a truth: the concentrated must be precise and powerful, while the dispersed must be loose and soft. If you don't believe me, please look at some of the articles published in newspapers and magazines in recent years.
    As the saying goes, "If there is something to say, make it long; if there is nothing to say, make it short; skip the irrelevant details and get back to the main topic." Today, many articles often lengthen even when there is nothing to say, and narrate irrelevant details; one meaningful sentence is broken into ten sentences, and the result is bound to be "nonsense." Bland and tasteless, who would want to read it?

    棉花和铁

    “一斤棉花重，一斤铁重？”
    “一斤铁重。”小学生好像没加思索地回答了。
    这回答当然可以博人一笑，但是仔细一想，觉得还是他的道理对。
    一斤铁只一小块，一斤棉花却有一大堆，虽然铁和棉花的分量不差分毫。于是我悟出一个道理来：集中的一定精密有力，分散的必然松弛虚软。不信请看近年来报刊上发表的一些文章。
    常言道：“有话即长，无话即短；闲言少叙，书归正传。”今天很多文章却常常无话也长，闲言多叙；一句有味的话，分作十句讲，结果一定要“扯淡”。淡而无味，谁还要看？
