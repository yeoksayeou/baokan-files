    Too Many Internal Documents

    To the Editors:

    I am a typist in an office, and I handle a lot of documents. Recently, I was also responsible for sorting through documents, and I feel that the Party is issuing too many internal documents. Taking the internal documents that our Yong'an Prefectural Committee office regularly receives as an example: In addition to the publications issued by the Central Committee, there are more than a dozen publications issued by provincial-level departments directly under the province, and even more internal instructions and reports. As a result, a director of a department of the prefectural committee receives five or six kinds of documents every day. They are very busy with their work and can only read important documents, skimming the titles of general documents. Grassroots cadres also throw documents around because they cannot keep up with reading them.

    With so many documents, the number of typists, dispatchers, proofreaders, and other personnel also increases, resulting in a large organization and wasted manpower.

    In a period of rapid socialist construction, it is understandable that documents will increase with the development of work. However, the above situation shows that the increase is excessive, and it is necessary to appropriately merge some documents that can be merged and reduce some unnecessary internal documents. Internal documents that must be issued should also consider being sent only to relevant departments and leading cadres. This will not only help change the leadership style but also reduce the size of organizations and save administrative expenses.

### 内部文件太多了

    内部文件太多了编辑同志：
    我是一个机关打字员，接触文件较多，最近又负责清理文件，因此感到党内印发的文件太多。以我们永安地委机关经常收发的内部文件来说：党内刊物，除了中央印发的刊物外，省直属机关印发的有十几种，内部指示、报告就更多。这样，地委的一个部长每天就要收到五、六种文件。他们工作很忙，只能拣重要文件阅读，对一般文件流览一下标题。基层干部也因为看不过来，把文件到处乱扔。
    文件多，打字、收发、校对等人员也随之增多，结果机构庞大，人力浪费。
    在社会主义建设迅速开展的时期，文件随着工作的开展而有所增加是可以理解的，但是，上述情况说明增加得过多，需要适当地合并一些可以合并和缩减一些可有可无的内部文件。必须印发的内部文件，也应该考虑只发给有关的部门和领导干部。这样既有助于改变领导作风，又可以紧缩机构，节省行政开支。
