Xinhua News Agency, 13th.

The central topic of the National Library Work Conference, convened by the Ministry of Culture from the 5th to the 13th in Beijing, was how library work can serve scientific research.

The conference unanimously agreed that libraries are powerful weapons for advancing towards science and good assistants for scientific researchers. All forces must be mobilized and brought into play to work together to bring science up to the advanced world level.

The conference put forward the basic tasks of library work: to serve scientific research and to serve the popularization of culture and education. It also pointed out that it was incomplete to only pay attention to popularizing books in the past few years and not to assist scientific research work.

The conference criticized the phenomena that hindered service to science in the past. A large number of books were backlogged in public libraries. According to statistics in 1955, the backlogged books totaled 10 million, accounting for more than one-third of the total collection of public libraries nationwide. Most libraries have also done poorly in collecting scattered books. The purchase of new books and periodicals also lacked planning, so that some necessary books and materials were not purchased; on the other hand, unnecessary books and periodicals were blindly purchased, and there was too much duplication. The conference also criticized some public libraries for cumbersome borrowing procedures and excessive rules and regulations, making it difficult for readers to borrow the books they need. The conference believes that the main reason for these obstacles is that the Ministry of Culture and cultural leadership organs at all levels have not paid enough attention to library work and have lacked specific leadership for a long time.

The conference put forward specific measures to eliminate these obstacles. First of all, it is necessary to quickly organize forces to promptly sort out existing books and supplement needed books, and compile joint catalogs for scientific research work; at the same time, open scientific reading rooms in libraries in provinces and large cities with conditions; in general, borrowing methods should be improved, and all kinds of works of scientific research value from ancient and modern China and foreign countries should be provided as widely as possible for readers to refer to.

Ding Xilin, Vice Minister of Culture, Liu Zhiming, Vice Minister of Culture, Tao Menghe, Vice President of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and others attended the meeting. Ding Xilin introduced the general situation of national library work at the meeting. Liu Zhiming asked library workers to start from the existing foundation, give full play to the existing strength, and serve science well under the conditions of gradually increasing necessary equipment and books. Tao Menghe put forward the requirements and hopes of scientists at the meeting.

Soviet library experts from the Ministry of Culture also attended the meeting and made reports.

More than 300 people, including library experts, workers, and relevant personnel from cultural departments from various places, participated in the meeting.

    全国图书馆工作会议
    讨论图书馆工作为科学研究服务问题
    据新华社13日讯　图书馆工作如何为科学研究服务是文化部五日到十三日在北京召开的全国图书馆工作会议的中心议题。
    会议一致认为图书馆是向科学进军的有力武器，是科学研究工作者的良好助手。必须动员和发挥一切力量，共同为使科学赶上世界先进水平而努力。
    会议提出了图书馆工作的基本任务：是为科学研究服务，为普及文化教育工作服务。并且指出过去几年中仅仅注意进行图书普及工作而不注意协助科学研究工作是不全面的。
    会议对过去障碍为科学服务的现象提出批评。各地公共图书馆大量积压图书，据1955年统计，积压的图书，共达一千万册，占全国公共图书馆全部藏书量的三分之一强。大部分图书馆对搜集流散图书的工作做得也很不够。采购新的书刊也缺乏计划性，以至有些必要的图书资料没有购买；另一方面又盲目采购不必要的书刊，并且过多地重复。会议还批评了某些公共图书馆借书手续烦琐，清规戒律过多，使读者不容易借到需要的图书等缺点。会议认为产生这些障碍的主要原因是文化部和各级文化领导机关对图书馆工作重视不够，长期以来缺乏具体领导。
    会议提出了消除这些障碍的各项具体措施，首先要迅速组织力量，及时清理现有图书和补充需要图书，编制供科学研究工作应用的专题联合目录；同时在有条件的省和大城市图书馆里开辟科学阅览室；一般都应该改进借书方法，并且尽最大可能广泛提供古今中外各种学派有科学研究价值的著作，给读者参考。
    文化部副部长丁西林、刘芝明，中国科学院副院长陶孟和等人都出席了会议。丁西林在会上介绍了全国图书馆工作的概况。刘芝明要求图书馆工作者从现有基础出发，充分发挥现有力量，在逐步增加必要设备和图书的条件下，很好地为科学服务。陶孟和在会上提出了科学家们的要求和希望。
    文化部苏联图书馆专家也到会作了报告。
    参加这次会议的有图书馆专家、工作者和各地文化部门有关人员三百多人。
