Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 28th - At the Heilongjiang Provincial Department of Industry's award ceremony for excellent local industrial products and new products held on the 27th, twenty-four kinds of excellent local industrial products and twenty-five kinds of new products were assessed as award-winning products, and prize money or banners were awarded to the units producing these products. The quality of these award-winning products has reached or approached the level of advanced products in China, and many of them are products exported abroad.

The ten-row seeder produced by Songhua River Machinery Factory, which won the first prize, was of poor quality in the past. After the efforts of the workers to improve it, strengthen technical management, and learn and apply advanced manufacturing experience, the product quality reached the national standard and was welcomed by farmers. Another award-winning product, the women's high-heeled leather shoes produced by the Harbin Leather and Shoe United Factory for export, has novel styles, bright colors, and solid quality, meeting export requirements. This year, the national foreign trade export department has greatly increased orders to this factory, from 20,000 pairs exported last year to 80,000 pairs this year.

The award-winning new products are mostly important products urgently needed for current production and people's lives. For example, the large-scale thresher trial-produced by Jiamusi Machinery Factory can thresh wheat, barley, and naked barley. After a slight modification, it can also thresh crops such as soybeans and sorghum.

At the award ceremony, factories and enterprises also exchanged experiences in improving product quality, reducing costs, and trial-producing new products.

    黑龙江省工业厅  
    奖励生产优良产品和新产品的单位
    新华社哈尔滨28日电　在黑龙江省工业厅二十七日召开的地方工业优良产品、新产品奖励会上，有二十四种地方工业优良产品和二十五种新产品被评定为受奖的产品，把奖金或奖旗授予生产这些产品的单位。这些受奖的产品，质量都达到或接近了国内的先进产品水平，其中有许多是向国外出口的产品。
    获得一等奖的松花江机械厂生产的十行播种机，过去质量不好，经过职工的努力改进，加强了技术管理，学习和运用了先进的制造经验，使产品质量达到了国家标准，受到农民的欢迎。另一获奖的哈尔滨制革制鞋联合工厂生产的出口产品女高跟皮鞋，样式新颖，色泽鲜艳，质量坚固，质量达到出口要求。今年国家对外贸易出口部门向这个厂大大增加了订货，由去年出口二万双增加到今年的八万双。
    得奖的新产品，多是当前生产和人民生活上迫切需重的重要产品。如佳木斯机械厂试制的大型脱谷机，除可以脱小麦、大麦、稞麦以外，稍加改装以后还可脱大豆、高粱等农作物。
    在奖励会上，各工厂企业还交流了提高产品质量、降低成本和试制新产品的经验。
