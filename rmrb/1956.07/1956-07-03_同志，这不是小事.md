    Comrade, This is No Small Matter
    Shěn Shí
    When I visited the Junggar Basin, I heard answers like this:
    "Comrade! Is your captain here?" I asked.
    "He went to Suilai."
    "Comrade! Is your political commissar at home?" I asked. "You've come at the right time; he just returned from Dihua."
    But Urumqi stopped being called "Dihua" long ago. Manas also abandoned the name "Suilai" a long time ago.
    Near Liugou, not far from Usu County, I asked the people there, "What is this place called?"
    "Dazi Temple."
    Is it really "Dazi Temple"? The Uyghurs call it "Qayindiqi"!
    I have been to the foot of the Tianshan Mountains near Shihezi, where there is a stud farm. Not far from the stud farm, there is also a place called "Dazi Temple."
    Everyone knows that it was only during the feudal dynasties and the Kuomintang bandit gang's rule that Mongolian compatriots were called "Dazi," which is a derogatory term. After the founding of the People's Republic of China, the relationship between nationalities changed, and this term should also be changed. As early as 1951, the then Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government issued instructions on handling appellations and place names with discriminatory and insulting connotations toward ethnic minorities. However, even now, there are still a few people who use this kind of appellation, and a few places retain this kind of place name. This is incompatible with the new relationship of close unity among all ethnic groups today.
    Some people say, "These are just small things." Comrade! This is no small matter; it is a big issue involving the national self-esteem of ethnic minorities, and it is also an issue involving whether our Han comrades respect ethnic minorities. If, on the one hand, we talk about the great principle of close unity among all ethnic groups, but on the other hand, we do not pay attention to so-called small things that concretely and subtly express this close unity, it is very wrong. Therefore, any name that has been explicitly changed should not be allowed to use the old name. And any name that has not yet been changed, now is the time to change it immediately.

    同志，这不是小事
    沈石
    当我访问准噶尔盆地的时候，曾经听到过这样的答话。
    “同志！你们的队长在不在呢？”我问。
    “他到绥来去了。”
    “同志！你们的政委在家吗？”我问。“你来得正好，他刚从迪化回来。”
    但是乌鲁木齐，早就不叫“迪化”了。玛纳斯也早就抛弃了“绥来”的称呼。
    在离乌苏县城不远的柳沟附近，我问过那里的人：“这地方叫什么？”
    “达子庙”。
    真的是“达子庙”吗？维吾尔人都称它“卡因笛克”哩！
    我到过石河子附近的天山脚下，那里有座种羊场。离种羊场不远，有一处地方，也叫做“达子庙”。
    谁都知道，在封建皇朝和国民党匪帮统治的岁月里，才把蒙古族同胞叫做“达子”，这是一种带有侮辱性的名称。中华人民共和国成立以后，民族关系改变了，这种称呼也应该改变。远在1951年，当时的中央人民政府政务院就发布了处理带有歧视和侮辱少数民族性质的称谓、地名等的指示。但是，直到现在，还有少数人仍然使用这种性质的称谓，还有少数地方保留着这种性质的地名。这是和今天各族人民亲密团结的新关系不相容的。
    有人说：“这些，只不过是小事。”同志！这不是小事，这是牵涉到少数民族的民族自尊心的大问题，也是牵涉到我们汉族同志是不是尊重少数民族的大问题。如果一方面在讲各民族亲密团结的大道理，另一方面却不注意具体而微地表现这种亲密团结关系的所谓小事情，是很不对的。因此凡是已经明令改变了的名称，就不能允许用旧的名称。凡是还没有改变的，现在也是立即改变的时候了。
