    Iron Tree Blossoms
    An iron tree cultivated in the Beijing Working People's Cultural Palace has blossomed. This tall iron tree has a stem about ten feet high, and its leaves are two feet long, with a hard texture and edges that curl backwards. The open flowers are shaped like pineapples and are light yellow in color. This iron tree has been on display in the open space near the flowerbeds of the Cultural Palace since the 14th for visitors to admire. It is generally said that iron trees bloom once every sixty years, which is extremely rare.

    铁树开花
    北京市劳动人民文化宫培植的一株铁树开了花。这株高大的铁树茎高约一丈，叶儿有两尺来长，叶质坚硬，边缘反卷。开放的花，形状像菠萝，颜色是淡黄色的。这株铁树十四日起陈列在文化宫花坛附近的空地上，供游人观赏。一般说法，铁树每六十年开花一次，至为难得。
