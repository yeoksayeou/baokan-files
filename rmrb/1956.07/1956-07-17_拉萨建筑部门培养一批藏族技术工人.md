Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, 16th. More than one thousand Tibetan workers participating in various construction projects in Lhasa have mostly learned the operational techniques of over ten types of earth and stone work. Their teachers are the Han workers who work alongside them.

Now, at the construction site of the Lhasa Hydropower Station, more than one hundred Tibetan workers are excavating canals on the steep mountainside. A little over a month ago, they were ordinary workers who only knew earthwork; now they have learned the complete set of techniques for blasting rocky cliffs. Initially, they didn't know how to drill blasting holes and were afraid to load explosives. Han workers held the steel drills for them and patiently taught them the operating procedures. Several simple bridges and culverts on a recently completed highway branch line near Lhasa were built by Tibetan workers. On various building construction sites in Lhasa, one can see many Tibetan workers already doing relatively simple technical work, standing beside skilled Han workers, learning as they work.

The Lhasa construction department recently drafted a preliminary plan to train Tibetan workers, preparing to first train a group of Tibetan stonemasons, and will successively train various Tibetan technical workers in various basic construction projects.

    拉萨建筑部门培养一批藏族技术工人
    新华社拉萨16日电　参加拉萨市各项建筑工程的一千多名藏族工人，大多数人已经学会了十几种土石方作业的操作技术。他们的师傅就是一起作工的汉族工人。
    现在，在拉萨水力发电厂的工地上，有一百多名藏族工人正在一座很陡的石山山腰开凿水渠。他们在一个多月前还是只会土方作业的普通工人，现在学会了全套爆破石崖的技术。起初，他们不会打炮眼、不敢装药，汉族工人给他们掌着钢钎，耐心教会他们操作规程。拉萨附近最近完工的一条公路支线上，有好几座便桥和涵洞都是藏族工人修建的。在拉萨各个房屋建筑工地上，可以看到不少藏族工人已经在做较为简易的技术工作，他们站在熟练的汉族工人身旁，边作边学。
    拉萨的建筑部门最近拟制了一个培养藏族工人的初步计划，准备首先培养一批藏族石工，在各项基本建设中还将陆续培养各种藏族技术工人。
