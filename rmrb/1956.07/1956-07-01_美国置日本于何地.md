The Tokyo "Mainichi Shimbun" reported on June 25 that the U.S. Navy will establish a missile base in the Yokosuka area. This news immediately aroused the indignation and unease of the Japanese people. The Japan Socialist Party issued a statement firmly opposing the U.S. plan. The statement pointed out that this plan shows that the U.S. intends to completely turn Japan into a nuclear weapons base. This sentiment of the Japanese people is understandable and worthy of sympathy.

Because, as everyone knows, missiles are long-range offensive weapons that can launch nuclear weapons. The U.S. establishing a base for this kind of weapon on Japanese territory—and in the densely populated Tokyo-Yokohama area—poses an exceptionally serious threat to the safety of the Japanese people. The experience of World War II proves that the areas near the long-range weapons bases established by Hitler's forces in Western Europe were precisely the places that invited devastating retaliation.

After the U.S. plan to establish a missile base was revealed, the U.S. Far East Naval Headquarters, while admitting that the Navy had requested $240,000 in appropriations for the 1957 fiscal year to build the base, used a “putting up a sign saying 'No 300 taels of silver buried here'” tone to disguise it, saying that what they planned to build was not a base, but a kind of "maintenance equipment."

However, this kind of cover-up is futile. It is now very clear that the U.S. conspiracy is to create, inch by inch, a fait accompli of turning Japan into a nuclear war base, step by step dragging the Japanese people into the abyss of war. Everyone remembers that when the U.S. transported its nuclear rocket launchers to Japan last year, it also deceived the Japanese people by saying that only the launchers were transported and no nuclear warheads were installed. Afterwards, the U.S. transported B-57 bombers carrying nuclear weapons to Japan. In February of this year, the U.S. also held a large-scale "nuclear war" exercise on Iwo Jima near Japan. Now, while the U.S. is testing hydrogen bombs in the Pacific, it is also forcibly requisitioning large amounts of Japanese people's land to expand airports all over Japan, and is even openly establishing missile bases. Obviously, the aggressive desires of U.S. war forces are endless.

Japan is a country that has suffered large-scale slaughter by U.S. nuclear weapons, and has been severely damaged more than once in U.S. nuclear weapons tests after the war. More than 38 million people in Japan have signed petitions against nuclear weapons; the struggle against U.S. military bases has never stopped. However, the U.S. ignores the just calls of the Japanese people, and instead is increasingly actively building various bases for the use of nuclear weapons in Japan. It should be pointed out that the purpose of the U.S. in doing so is not only to poison the international atmosphere in the Far East with war preparations, and to carry out intimidation and blackmail against the peace-loving people of various countries in the Far East, but especially maliciously, the U.S. attempts to use these bases to encircle and control Japan, forming a coercive situation for Japan, in order to force the Japanese people to once again serve as sacrifices for the U.S. in a nuclear war.

It is worth noting that, according to sources in the Japanese Defense Agency, the Japanese Defense Agency has not yet received formal notification regarding the U.S. plan to establish a missile base on Japanese territory. If this is true, then where exactly does the U.S. place Japan? Obviously, in the eyes of the U.S., Japan is its colony, and it can do whatever it wants there without having to notify anyone. Can this be tolerated by an independent sovereign country?

The international situation has undergone tremendous changes. Even Iceland, which is much smaller than Japan, can no longer tolerate the U.S. maintaining military bases on its territory. We believe that the Japanese people, who have a long and glorious tradition of independence, will not allow the current humiliating situation to continue to exist.

### 美国置日本于何地

    美国置日本于何地
    李高
    东京“每日新闻”在六月二十五日报道说，美国海军将在横须贺地区建立一个导弹基地。这个消息立刻引起了日本人民的愤慨和不安。日本社会党发表声明，坚决反对美国的这个计划。声明指出，这项计划表明美国打算把日本完全变成一个原子武器基地。日本人民的这种情绪是可以理解而且值得同情的。
    因为，大家知道，导弹是可以发射原子武器的远射程攻击性武器。美国把这种武器的基地建立在日本领土上——而且是在人口稠密的东京—横滨地区，对日本人民的安全造成了异常严重的威胁。第二次世界大战中的经验证明，希特勒部队在西欧建立的远射程武器基地附近，正就是招致毁灭性的还击的地方。
    在美国建立导弹基地的计划被揭露以后，美国远东海军总部一面承认，海军已经要求在1957财政年度拨款二十四万美元来建造这个基地，一面却用一种“此地无银三百两”的口吻掩饰说，他们计划建立的据说不是基地，而是一种“检修的设备”。
    然而这种遮遮掩掩的手段是徒劳的。现在已经可以看得很清楚，美国的阴谋是要得寸进尺地造成把日本变成原子战争基地的既成事实，一步一步地把日本人民拖进战争的火坑。大家记得，去年美国把它的原子火箭发射器运到日本时，也是用所谓只运来了发射器、没有装上原子弹头的话来欺瞒日本人民的。而后，美国又把载运原子武器的B—57型轰炸机运到了日本。今年二月，美国又在日本附近的硫黄岛举行了大规模的“原子战”演习。现在，美国一面在太平洋上试验氢弹，一面又在日本各地大量强征日本人民的土地扩建飞机场，还要公然建立导弹基地。显然，美国战争势力的侵略欲望是没有止境的。
    日本是曾经遭受美国原子武器的大规模屠杀的国家，战后又不止一次地在美国的原子武器试验中受到重大损害。日本有三千八百多万人签名反对原子武器；反对美国军事基地的斗争一天也没有停止过。但是，美国却对日本人民的正义呼声置之不理，反而日甚一日地在日本积极建设使用原子武器的各种基地。应当指出，美国这样做的目的不仅是为了用战争准备来毒化远东的国际气氛，向爱好和平的远东各国人民施行恫吓讹诈，尤其恶毒的是美国企图利用这些基地包围和控制日本，对日本形成裹胁的形势，以便逼着日本人民在原子战争中再一次给美国充当牺牲。
    值得注意的是：据日本防卫厅人士说，关于美国这个要在日本领土上建立导弹基地的计划，日本防卫厅到现在还没有得到正式通知。如果这是事实的话，那末美国究竟把日本置于何地？显然，在美国心目中，日本就是它的殖民地，它用不着通知任何人就可以在那里为所欲为。这难道是一个独立的主权国家所能容忍的吗？
    国际局势已经起了巨大的变化。比日本小得多的冰岛都已经不能容忍美国在它的领土上保持军事基地了。我们相信，有长期光荣的独立传统的日本人民，是不会容许目前这种屈辱的情况继续存在下去的。
