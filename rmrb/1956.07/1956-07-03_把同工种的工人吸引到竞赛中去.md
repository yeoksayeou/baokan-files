The industrial and mining enterprises in Changchun, Jilin, Liaoyuan and other cities in Jilin Province have recently launched competitions between individuals and groups of the same trade (hereinafter referred to as "same-trade competitions"). This type of competition is very popular among employees and is developing rapidly. In Jilin City, 28 trades in five construction and installation companies have launched same-trade competitions. In the Taixin Mine of the Liaoyuan Mining Bureau, 24 trades have launched same-trade competitions, with the number of participants accounting for 94% of all personnel in their respective trades. In Changchun City, 4,193 people in eight major trades in various construction units have launched inter-factory same-trade competitions.

Workers Like Same-Trade Competitions

Workers especially like same-trade competitions because: Firstly, it can fully reflect the socialist enthusiasm of the broad masses of employees in "everyone striving to be first" and "everyone striving to improve," it can more prominently demonstrate the leading role of advanced producers as the backbone, and it can more sharply urge backward workers to catch up. Because everyone is the same worker, using the same tools, doing the same work, in the competition, they will naturally feel why others can do it, but they can’t? As the tram drivers of the Taixin Mine of the Liaoyuan Mining Bureau said after exchanging experiences: "If you can do it, I can do it too." Secondly, exchanging experiences by the same trade, everyone speaks the same language, has the same needs, and it is easy to learn from each other's strengths and make up for each other's weaknesses. Thirdly, it can involve employees in every corner in the competition and eliminate dead ends. Even the cooks in Taixin Mine have launched competitions, planning to save 25,000 jin of grain for the country by the end of the year. Therefore, workers call same-trade competitions a competition where "every profession produces a champion."

In the future, the requirements should be: In an enterprise, competitions must be carried out according to trades, and competitions in all trades must be launched, attracting everyone in a trade to the competition. Many units are still reluctant to use the past practice of all-inclusive competitions, which is a manifestation of conservative thinking. Naturally, when launching same-trade competitions, the leadership should not use force equally, but should first mobilize the production department according to the specific situation, and gradually popularize it to the auxiliary departments; focus on mastering key trades, and generally take care of general trades.

Organize Competitions Between Similar Workshops and Sections

While carrying out same-trade competitions, each unit should also actively and with preparation carry out competitions between production units (sections, workshops, pit mouths, factories and mines) that are of the same type, have similar equipment, similar products, and similar technological processes (hereinafter referred to as "competitions between similar production units"). This is because same-trade competitions can only mobilize the masses of employees, but not easily mobilize leading cadres; they can only exchange experience in technical operations, but not exchange experience in leadership, management, and major technological reforms. Competitions between similar production units can solve these problems.

Competitions between similar production units can also unify the direction of same-trade competitions, give play to the role of same-trade competitions, and create conditions for same-trade competitions. Competitions between similar production units without the foundation of same-trade competitions will not have much effect on promoting production, because the improvement of production efficiency is ultimately based on the improvement of production tools and the improvement of workers' operating skills and production experience, which can only be directly solved by same-trade competitions. However, on the basis of same-trade competitions, carrying out competitions between similar production units and combining the two well can play a greater role than just carrying out same-trade competitions. Moreover, in some production units (such as coal mining sections, tunneling teams, chartered vehicle groups, mixed trade construction teams, etc.), trades, individuals, or groups cannot independently carry out production activities. The same-trade competitions in these units must be unified by competitions between similar production units in order to reflect its role.

According to existing experience, organizing competitions at the workshop and section level is easier and more convenient than organizing competitions at the factory and mine level in terms of formulating competition conditions, organizing inspections, conducting evaluations, and exchanging experiences, and the results are twice as good with half the effort. Therefore, when we organize competitions between similar production units today, the focus should be on workshops and sections.

Oppose the Style of Secretly Competing for Supremacy

Whether socialist competition is carried out well or not, the form of competition is of course related, but the decisive factor is still the organizational work in the competition process, specifically, the work of exchanging experience. The purpose of competition is by no means simply to compare the first and second, but to make the advanced drive the backward, the backward catch up with the advanced, and the advanced become more advanced through the comparison of advanced and backward, and finally achieve common improvement. The first and second place obtained without common improvement is meaningless. Leaving aside the exchange and promotion of advanced experience, leaving aside learning from each other's strengths and making up for each other's weaknesses, what other way can we achieve common improvement? However, some comrades still do not have a clear understanding of this point, or even have a wrong understanding. For example, the Taixin, Fuguo, Xi'an, and Pinggang mines of the Liaoyuan Mining Bureau all participated in the inter-mine competition of coal mines in Northeast China. Because the Xi'an and Pinggang mines did not complete the plan in the first quarter, they completely lost confidence in the competition and had already stood outside the competition circle. The Taixin and Fuguo mines overfulfilled the plan and both had hope of winning, but they did not communicate with each other and only competed secretly. For another example, the non-ferrous metal mines participating in the all-Northeast inter-mine competition once gathered at the Shizu Copper Mine to perform. In order to show off, the Shizu Mine prepared good mines and good tools for itself, and prepared bad mines and tools for others. As for signing a competition contract and then "everything is fine" without follow-up, it is even a general phenomenon. It can be seen that the thinking of these comrades must be corrected so that same-trade competitions and competitions between similar production units can have good results.

In order to achieve the purpose of exchanging experience and making common progress, regular evaluations and periodic rewards are necessary. The essence of evaluation and reward is inspection and summary, propaganda and mobilization, praise and criticism. It can urge the backward to catch up and encourage the advanced to become more advanced. It is also very necessary to hold a competition meeting once in a certain period. This is a grand meeting of individuals or units participating in the competition, which marks the end of the previous competition and the beginning of the next competition. At the meeting, experiences should be widely exchanged, summary evaluations should be carried out, individuals or units that have progressed in the competition or helped others to progress should be rewarded, and the goals for the next competition should be formulated. Holding such a meeting well will greatly promote the competition.

    把同工种的工人吸引到竞赛中去
    中共吉林省委工业部
    最近长春、吉林、辽源等市的工矿企业，相继开展了工种相同的个人与个人之间和小组与小组之间的竞赛（下称同工种竞赛）。这种竞赛很受职工群众欢迎，发展很快。吉林市五个建筑安装公司已有二十八个工种开展了同工种竞赛。辽源矿务局太信矿二十四个工种开展了同工种竞赛，参加人数占各该工种全部人员的94％。长春市各建筑单位有八个主要工种四千一百九十三人开展了厂际的同工种竞赛。
    工人喜欢同工种竞赛
    工人特别喜欢同工种竞赛，因为：第一、它能充分地体现出广大职工“人人争先”“人人上进”的社会主义积极性，能更突出地发挥先进生产者的骨干带头作用，能更尖锐地督促落后工人赶上去。因为大家是一样的工人，拿着一样的工具，干着相同的活儿，在竞赛中很自然地会感到为什么人家能办到的事情，自己就办不到呢？正如辽源矿务局太信矿的电车司机在交流经验以后说的：“你们能的，我也能”。第二、按同工种交流经验，大家的言语相同，需求相同，便于彼此取长补短，互相学习。第三、它能够把各个角落的职工都卷入竞赛，消灭死角。太信矿连炊事员也开展了竞赛，计划到年底为国家节约粮食二万五千斤。所以工人叫同工种竞赛是“行行出状元”的竞赛。
    今后应该这样要求：在一个企业里，必须按工种开展竞赛，要把所有工种的竞赛都开展起来，把一个工种的每一个人都吸引到竞赛中去。不少单位还留恋过去那种一揽子竞赛的作法，是一种保守思想的表现。自然，在开展同工种竞赛的时候，领导上不宜平均使用力量，而应该根据具体情况，首先发动生产部门，逐渐普及到辅助部门；重点掌握关键性的工种，普遍照顾一般性的工种。
    组织同类车间、工段竞赛
    各单位在开展同工种竞赛的同时，还应该积极地有准备地开展类型相同、设备相仿、产品相近、工艺过程相似的生产单位（工段、车间、坑口、厂矿）之间的竞赛（以下简称类同生产单位之间的竞赛）。这是因为同工种竞赛只能发动职工群众，不易发动领导干部；只能交流技术操作方面的经验，不能交流领导、管理和重大技术改革方面的经验。类同生产单位之间的竞赛就可以解决这些问题。
    类同生产单位之间的竞赛，还可以统一同工种竞赛的方向，发挥同工种竞赛的作用，为同工种竞赛创造条件。没有同工种竞赛做基础的类同生产单位之间的竞赛，对推动生产是不会有多大作用的，因为生产效率的提高，归根到底是基于生产工具的改进和工人操作技术与生产经验的提高，这是靠同工种竞赛才能直接解决的问题。但是，在同工种竞赛的基础上，再开展类同生产单位之间的竞赛，并且使二者很好地结合起来，比只开展同工种竞赛能发挥更大的作用。况且，在有些生产单位（如采煤段、掘进队、包车组、混合工种建筑施工队等），工种、个人或小组，不能独立地进行生产活动，这些单位的同工种竞赛，就必须用类同生产单位之间的竞赛统一起来，才能体现出它的作用。
    根据已有的经验，组织车间工段一级的竞赛，无论在制定竞赛条件，或组织检查、进行评比、交流经验等工作上，都比组织厂矿一级的竞赛简易方便，事半功倍。因此，我们今天组织类同生产单位之间的竞赛时，重点应该在车间、工段。
    反对暗地争雄的作风
    社会主义竞赛开展得好坏，竞赛的形式当然是有关系的，但是决定性的因素还是竞赛过程中的组织工作，具体一点说就是交流经验工作。竞赛的目的决不是单纯地为了比出第一、第二，而是通过对先进与落后的比较，使先进的带动落后的，落后的赶上先进的，先进的更加先进，最后达到共同提高。不是在共同提高基础上所得出来的第一、第二，是毫无意义的。离开先进经验的交流推广，离开彼此取长补短互相学习，还有什么办法能使大家共同提高呢？但是有些同志至今对这一点的认识还不很明确，甚至是错误的。例如：辽源矿务局太信、富国、西安、平岗四个矿都参加了东北地区煤矿的矿际竞赛。西安、平岗两矿因为第一季度没有完成计划，对竞赛完全丧失了信心，早已站在竞赛圈外。太信、富国两矿超额完成了计划，都有优胜的希望，但彼此不相往来，不通声息，只在暗地里争雄。再如参加全东北矿际竞赛的有色金属矿，有一次集中到石咀铜矿作表演，石咀矿为了显示自己，给自己准备了好的矿场、好的工具，而给别人准备了坏的矿场和工具。至于签订过竞赛合同，就“万事大吉”没有下文的，更是一般现象。这可以看出，必须端正这些同志的思想，同工种竞赛和类同的生产单位之间的竞赛，才会有好的效果。
    为了达到交流经验、共同提高的目的，经常评比、定期奖励是必要的。评比奖励的实质就是检查总结，就是宣传鼓动，就是表扬和批评。它能督促落后的赶上去，鼓舞先进的更加先进。一定期间召开一次竞赛大会也是非常必要的。这是参加竞赛的个人或单位的大会师，它标志着上届竞赛的结束，下届竞赛的开始。要在会上广泛地交流经验，要进行总结性的评比，要奖励那些在竞赛中前进了的或者帮助别人前进了的个人或单位，并且制定下届竞赛的奋斗目标。开好这样的大会，对竞赛有很大的推动作用。
