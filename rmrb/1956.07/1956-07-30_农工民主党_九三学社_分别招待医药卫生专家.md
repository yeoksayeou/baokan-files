    Also reported, the Central Committee of the Jiusan Society held a tea reception on July 27th to welcome all the more than 100 members of the society and some medical and health experts from outside the society who attended the member representative conferences of the Chinese Medical Association and four other academic societies, and to discuss the difficulties to be overcome and the conditions to be created in implementing the "Let a hundred flowers bloom" policy.
    Liu Sizhi, Professor of Beijing Medical College and a physiological biochemistry expert, Zhang Xiaoqian, Professor of Peking Union Medical College and an internal medicine expert, Feng Lanzhou, a parasitology expert, Zhou Jinhuang, a pharmacologist, Chen Lunhui, Professor of Hubei Medical College and a pharmacologist, Zheng Ji, Professor of Nanjing University and a biochemist, Su Zufei, Deputy Director of Shanghai Children's Hospital, Chen Bangxian, Professor of Shanghai Second Medical College and a public health expert, and Hou Zonglian, President of Northwest Medical College, spoke at the meeting. They believed that at present, in regard to "Let a hundred flowers bloom," the emphasis should still be on overcoming ideological concerns and man-made obstacles, breaking down idol worship, authoritative thinking, and sectarian biases. However, it is more important to take immediate action. Many experts advocated and expressed their willingness to actually "bring out something," take action personally, and take the lead in "contending."

    农工民主党　九三学社
    分别招待医药卫生专家
    本报讯　中国农工民主党中央委员会在七月二十六日举行招待会，招待出席中华医学会、中国药学会、中国生理学会、中国微生物学会、中国解剖学会全国会员代表大会部分代表和北京著名中西医等共五百多人。中华医学会理事长傅连暲、中国生理学会理事长赵以炳、中国微生物学会理事长汤飞凡以及香港和澳门的医学家侯宝璋等都应邀参加了这次招待会。
    又讯　九三学社中央委员会七月二十七日举行招待茶会，欢迎出席中华医学会等五个学会会员代表大会的全体社员一百余人和社外一部分医药卫生专家，座谈了目前在贯彻执行“百家争鸣”方针中要克服那些困难和创造那些条件的问题。
    北京医学院教授、生理生化专家刘思职，协和医学院教授、内科专家张孝骞，寄生虫学专家冯兰州，药理学家周金璜，湖北医学院教授、药理学家陈伦会，南京大学教授、生化学家郑集，上海儿童医院副院长苏祖斐，上海第二医学院教授、公共卫生学家陈邦宪，西北医学院院长侯宗濂等在会上发言。他们认为关于“百家争鸣”目前还应着重克服思想顾虑和人为障碍，破除偶像崇拜、权威思想和门户之见，但更重要的是应立即行动起来，不少专家都主张并表示愿意实际“拿出东西来”，亲自动手，带头“争鸣”。
