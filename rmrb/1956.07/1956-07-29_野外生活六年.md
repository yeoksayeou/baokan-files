Six Years of Field Life
By our reporter Shen Shi

Comrade Zhao Yan, the Party Secretary of the Geological Survey Department of the Xinjiang Petroleum Administration, was very happy to hear that I wanted to interview the staff of the petroleum prospecting team. He said, "Our young lads have been in the field for six years. However, they are rarely seen in the newspapers." I am very grateful to this enthusiastic person for his timely reminder. Before leaving, he drew a route map for the visit and said to me, "The map is drawn, but I can't guarantee whether you can find them. You'll have to inquire several times on the road!"

His words were very true. It really takes some effort to visit the petroleum prospecting team. Take the Geodetic Survey Team, for example! Wherever there is a need for surveying, there are always traces of the team members first. The task of each of their periods is not tens or hundreds of square kilometers, but thousands of square kilometers. In this team, some groups move every two or three days, and some even move three times a day. If you find out in the morning that they are somewhere, by the time you get there, they have already moved. Take the Astronomy Team, for another example! This team is very different from other teams. On those cloudless nights, when people are sound asleep, the female captain Yan Xing, with her team members, appears on the desolate plains where no one lives, stays beside the astronomical instrument, and concentrates on observing the stars to determine the latitude, longitude, and azimuth angle of the ground. After measuring this astronomical point, they move to a distant place again.

We took the route map and headed to Lake Ailik, passing by the shallow drilling team led by Zhang Ruiqing. Before we had been sitting for long, Zeng Xiangming, the chief geologist, walked into the dugout carrying a small iron bucket. He said with great interest, "Look! Crude oil!" The dark brown crude oil attracted everyone of us. And such a treasure flowed out of a scrapped shallow well. Later, in another shallow drilling team, Captain Zhang Xingyou led us to see the core taken from the shallow well. He pointed to the core and said:
"Look! There is a lot of oil sand here." I picked up a piece, put it close to my nose, and the oil sand emitted a strong kerosene smell.

What a rich Junggar Basin! Although there are still vast wastelands on its surface, and you can still see continuous deserts and Gobi, there are inexhaustible treasures hidden in the strata. These treasures, buried underground for many years, attract tens of thousands of prospecting personnel. They have lived in sparsely populated areas for six years, hoping to discover large oil-bearing structures, and to see with their own eyes the derricks erected and crude oil spewing out in the areas they have prospected. I once saw the members of Zhuang Guocheng's seismic team, taking advantage of their rest days, walked from a distant construction site to Karamay to visit the exploratory well being tested for oil. Around the exploratory well, next to the oil tanks filled with crude oil, how radiant they were! They had measured the well location of the exploratory well there. By the time the derrick was erected and the crude oil was spewing out, they had already left there and were active in another wasteland.

In this seismic team, I met a tractor driver. His name is Hou Jingchang. Before, he was a soldier of the People's Liberation Army and participated in the Shajiadian and Wazijie battles. He left the army and has been driving a tractor for six full years. His tractor does not plow the fertile land in the farm, nor does it pull the seeder in the cotton field to sow cotton seeds, but often travels in the places where cars have the most difficulty passing. Wherever the prospecting team goes, Hou Jingchang follows. If the car gets stuck in the mud, people say, "Hou Jingchang! Bring the tractor!" The car is quickly pulled out of the mud. If the car gets stuck in the sand nest, people say, "Hou Jingchang! We need your tractor again." He drives the tractor to the sand nest again.

When the car drives smoothly forward, the tractor is left behind. At this time, in the endless wilderness, only Hou Jingchang is left alone. He maintains the tractor well, and then drives it calmly to catch up with the prospecting personnel. Sometimes he can't find them, so he stays in the field alone.

Someone asked Hou Jingchang, "Are you lonely being alone in the field?"
"It would be a lie to say I'm not lonely. But how can I stay if I always think about loneliness?" Hou Jingchang is not willing to be lonely, because he carries dry food and books with him.

When he finds the prospecting team, he carries a large bundle of firewood on his back and puts it in the kitchen. Sometimes he is with the car driver, helping him repair the parts. People on the team say, "I have never seen Hou Jingchang idle." When I met him, there was still a scar on the corner of his mouth. It turned out that this was a trace left by a wooden stick hitting the corner of his mouth when he was helping the prospecting team to put up a tent.

Not far from Lake Ailik, in the wild Elaeagnus angustifolia forest, there were a dozen tents, and a clear river flowed in front of the forest. The Elaeagnus angustifolia flowers exuded a burst of fragrance, and seagulls flew back and forth by the river. No wonder that when we first met, the prospecting team members boasted to me about this beautiful environment.

It is indeed rare to find a place with water and trees to set up their temporary home. Although Xinjiang does not lack water, most of the places they go are barren wastelands far from water sources. In such a wasteland, water is naturally precious. Early in the morning, everyone goes out with a pot of water. During the prospecting, they have to carefully arrange the time to drink this pot of water. Usually, they would rather drink less in the morning, and they cannot drink all the water by the time they are off work, because they may get lost on the way back.

In this Elaeagnus angustifolia forest, I met Comrade Shao Anben of the seismic team. Last year, when he was surveying in the Turpan Basin, he was once trapped in a sand nest because he couldn't get water.

In August, although the Turpan Basin was unusually hot, the prospecting team members worked as usual. One day, Shao Anben led the guide wire team to the sand dune area on the edge of the Gobi by car. Among them were Uyghur workers Rouzi, Bawudong, and Abudu, Hui worker Ma You, and Han workers Yao Jiezong and Fu Fazhang. After they got out of the car, they agreed with the driver to wait for them in front of a sand dune at two o'clock in the afternoon.

The measurement began. The arrogant sun scorched the desert, and they felt their feet burning even through their rubber shoes. In front of them were sand mountains one after another. It was easy to get tired and thirsty while measuring and climbing mountains. Every time they drank water, they got thirsty again after a short time. At noon, the water in the pot was all gone.

At two o'clock in the afternoon, the agreed time with the driver arrived. Shao Anben said to Ma You, "You and Rouzi go to the sand dune where the car is parked! Get some water."

They did not return for more than an hour. Shao Anben was secretly worried about them. Could they have taken the wrong road? Could it be that the driver couldn't find the agreed place? The comrades were so thirsty that they couldn't stand it anymore. They couldn't wait any longer! He said to his companions, "Fu Fazhang! I heard that there is a lake not far from here. You and Yao Jiezong and Abudu go to the lake to get some water! Bawudong and I will go find them."

They set off separately. Shao Anben and Bawudong went to the sand dune, but there was no car. They only saw Rouzi and Ma You lying on the hillside where the sun didn't shine. Rouzi was so thirsty that he couldn't even speak.

Five people lay there, waiting for the car. The dry and hot wind swept over them like flames, and they were all drowsy with thirst. In a daze, Shao Anben heard the sound of a car in the distance. He struggled to stand up, climbed the sand mountain, saw the car, and shouted loudly, but the driver didn't hear him. He asked Ma You to come up, and the two of them called out together, but the driver still didn't hear them. The car drove for a while, and the driver saw the measuring flower pole inserted on the roadside. He stopped the car, got out of the cab, and looked around. He saw two people waving on the sand dune, drove the car over, and they drank water happily, and their energy slowly recovered. They also asked the car to drive to the lake, only to see that all three people were lying down. It turned out that they had drunk alkaline water containing mirabilite, and their stomachs were swollen and painful. Everyone helped them get into the car. By the time they returned to the team headquarters, it was already late at night.

I once visited the electrical survey team led by Liu Jingkuan. More than 20 kilometers away from the team headquarters, two electrical survey vehicles were parked in the undulating sand dunes. In the evening, the surveyors left. Several Kazakh soldiers were guarding the electrical survey vehicles in turns. In the desert, strong winds blew, dust and sand flew, and sometimes there were showers. Regardless of whether it was windy or rainy, they always stayed at their posts. During the day, when the surveyors came, they found a shady place, laid a piece of tarpaulin on the sand, and slept soundly. When they woke up, after eating, they were reading Kazakh books and newspapers again.

Some of these Uyghurs and Kazakhs came from the countryside, and some came from pastoral areas. When they were first liberated, they were more or less estranged from the Han comrades who came from outside. However, today, in the deserted wilderness, they are joining hands with the Han comrades. Needless to say, they all understand that although the place of combat now is the wilderness, as long as they catch up head-on, the wilderness will quickly change its face.

    野外生活六年
    本报记者　沈石
    新疆石油管理局地质调查处的党委书记赵焰同志听到我要访问石油勘测队的工作人员，心头很高兴。他说：“我们的年青小伙子们，在野外六个年头了。可是，报纸上很少见到他们。”我非常感谢这位热情奔放的人，给我的当头棒喝。临别的时候，他画了一张访问路线图，对我说：“图是绘了，能不能找到他们，我可不保险，在路上，你还得多打听几次哩！”
    他的话，说得很对，访问石油勘测队的人，的确要花一番工夫。譬如说大地测量队吧！凡是需要勘测的地方，总先有这个队队员的踪迹。他们每一期的任务，不是几十、几百平方公里，而是几千平方公里。在这个队里，有的小组，两三天搬一次家，有的小组甚至一天搬三次家。如果你早上打听到他们在某处地方，等到你赶到那儿，他们却早就搬走了。再拿天文队来说，这个队和别的队大不相同，在那万里无云的夜里，当人们好梦正酣的时候，女队长言行带着她的队员们出现在周围没有人烟的荒原上，守在天文仪旁，聚精会神地观测星星，来确定地面的经纬度和方位角，等到这一天文点测完了，他们又移到老远的地方去了。
    我们带着路线图，前往艾力克湖的时候，路过张瑞清率领的浅钻队。我们坐下没有多久，主任地质员曾向明提着一只小铁桶走进地窝子里来，他兴致勃勃地说：“你们看！原油！”棕黑色的原油，吸引了我们每一个人。而这样的宝物，不过从一口报废的浅井里流出来的。后来我们在另一个浅钻队里，队长张兴有引着我们去看从浅井里取出的岩芯，他边走边指着岩芯说：
  “瞧！这里有不少油砂。”我拾起一块，凑近鼻孔，油砂发出强烈的煤油气味。
    多富饶的准噶尔盆地啊！虽然在它的表面还有着辽阔的荒原，还可以看到连绵的沙漠和戈壁，在那地层里，却蕴藏着取之不尽的财富。这些长年埋在地下的宝藏，吸引着成千上万的勘测人员。他们在人烟稀少的地区，生活了六个年头，所希望的就是发现大的含油构造，就是在自己勘测过的地区，能够亲眼看到竖起了井架，喷出了原油。我曾经见过庄国成那个地震队的队员们，趁着休息的日子，从很远的工地，走到克拉玛依，参观正在试油的探井，在那探井周围，在那满盛着原油的油罐旁边，他们是怎样的眉飞色舞，他们曾经在那里，测出了探井的井位，等到井架竖立起来了，原油喷出来了，他们早就离开了那里，又活动在另一处荒原上了。
    在这个地震队里，见到了一位拖拉机驾驶员。他叫侯景昌。以前，他是人民解放军的一名战士，曾经参加过沙家店、瓦子街战役，他离开了部队，驾驶拖拉机，整整五年了。他的拖拉机，并不是在那农庄的田野里，翻耕肥沃的土地，也不是在那棉田里，牵引着播种机，播种棉花的种子，而是经常来往在汽车最难通行的地方。勘测队到哪里，侯景昌也跟到哪里，汽车陷进淤泥里了，人们说：“侯景昌！把拖拉机开来吧！”汽车很快便从淤泥里拖出来了。汽车陷在沙窝里了，人们说：“侯景昌！又需要你的拖拉机了。”他开着拖拉机又赶到沙窝里去。
    当汽车顺利地开向前去，拖拉机留在后面了。这时候，一眼望不到尽头的旷野里，只剩下侯景昌一个人。他把拖拉机保养好，然后不慌不忙地驾驶着它，去追赶勘测人员。有时找不着他们，他便单独留在野外。
    有人问过侯景昌。“你一个人待在野外，寂寞吗？”
      “说不寂寞，那是瞎说。不过老是想到寂寞，那又怎能待下去。”侯景昌是不甘寂寞的，因为他随身带有干粮和书籍。
    当他找到了勘测队，一忽儿背回一大捆干柴，放在伙房里。一忽儿和汽车司机在一起，帮助他修理机件。队上的人说：“从来没有看到侯景昌空闲过。”我会见他的时候，他的嘴边还有一块伤痕，原来这是他给勘测队员撑帐篷的时候，一根木棍打在嘴边遗留的痕迹。
    在离艾力克湖不远的地方，野生的沙枣林里，撑着十几顶帐篷，一湾清澈的河水，从林前流过。沙枣花发出阵阵清香，水鸥来回的在河边飞翔，无怪乎初次相逢，勘测队员便向我夸耀这幽美的环境了。
    找到有水有树的地方，安下他们临时的家，的确不可多得。尽管新疆并不缺水，可是他们所到之处，多半是离水源很远的荒原，在这样的荒原，水，自然珍贵了。清早，每个人带上一壶水出去，勘测当中，要好好地安排喝这壶水的时间，通常在上午宁肯少喝一些，到了收工的时候，也不能把水喝光，因为回去的路上，可能迷路。
    在这座沙枣林里，我见到了地震队的邵安本同志。去年，他在吐鲁番盆地测量时，曾经因为喝不上水一度被困在沙窝中。
    八月，尽管吐鲁番盆地热得出奇，勘测队员却照常地工作。一天，邵安本领着导线小组的人，坐上汽车，到了戈壁边缘的沙丘地带。他们当中，有维吾尔族工人肉孜、巴吾东和阿布都，有回族工人马有，还有汉族工人姚捷中和傅发章。他们下车后，同司机约定，到了下午两点钟，在一座沙丘跟前等候他们。
    测量开始了。骄横的阳光，把沙漠晒得滚热，隔着胶鞋也感到烫脚。挡在前面的，是一座一座的沙山，边测量，边爬山，容易疲劳，也容易口渴，每喝一次水，隔不多久，又渴起来。到正午，壶里的水全光了。
    下午两点钟，同司机约定的时间到了，邵安本对马有说：“你和肉孜到停车的沙丘跟前去吧！取些水来。”
    他们去了一个多钟头，还没有回来，邵安本暗中替他们担心，会不会走错了路呢？是不是司机找不着约定的地方呢？同志们都渴得忍受不住了，不能再等下去啊！他对同伴们说：“傅发章！听说离这儿不远有一座湖，你和姚捷中、阿布都到湖边取些水来吧！我和巴吾东去找他们。
    他们分头出发了，邵安本和巴吾东到了那座沙丘跟前，并没有汽车，只见到肉孜和马有躺在阳光照射不到的山坡下，肉孜渴得连话也说不成声了。
    五个人躺在那里，等待汽车，干燥的热风，像火焰一样掠过身边，他们都渴得昏昏迷迷了。邵安本在朦胧中听到远处有汽车的声音，他挣扎着站起来，爬上沙山，见到了汽车，他高声喊叫，司机没有听见；他又让马有上来，两人一道呼唤，司机仍然没有听见。汽车走了一阵，司机看到路旁插有测量的花杆，把车停下来，走出驾驶室，四处张望，见沙丘上有两人正在招手，把车开过去，他们痛快地喝了一顿水，精力才慢慢地恢复过来。又让汽车开到湖边，只见三个人全躺下了，原来他们喝了含有芒硝的碱水，肚子又涨又痛，大家帮助他们上了车，回到队部，已经夜静更深了。
    我曾经访问过刘敬宽率领的电测队。距离队部二十多公里，在那一起一伏的沙丘中，停放着两辆电测车。傍晚，测量的人走了。电测车旁，有几位哈萨克战士在轮流地守卫着。沙漠里，刮起大风，尘沙飞扬，有时也下阵雨。不管刮风，或者下雨，他们始终守在自己的岗位上。白天，测量的人来了，他们找一处阴凉的地方，用一块油布铺在沙上，呼呼地睡去，等到醒来，吃罢饭，他们又在翻阅哈萨克文的书报了。
    这些维吾尔人和哈萨克人，有的从农村中来，有的从牧区里来；当他们刚刚获得解放的时候，对于外来的汉族同志，多多少少有些隔阂。然而，到了今天，在那没有人烟的荒原上，他们同汉族同志携手并进了。不用说，全都明白，现在战斗的地方，虽然是荒野，只要迎头赶上去，荒野会迅速改变面貌的。
