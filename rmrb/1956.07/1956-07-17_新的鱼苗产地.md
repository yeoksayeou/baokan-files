    New Fish Fry Production Area
    (Our report) During the peak fish fry season in May, the Jiangxi Provincial Aquatic Products Bureau conducted a survey of fish fry resources in a section of the Yangtze River and at the exit of Poyang Lake within the province. They discovered three new fish fry production areas: Longkou River and Zhongjiao Port, 20 li east of Hukou County, and the south bank of the Yangtze River (Youxingzhou), 3 li west of Pengze. The three areas have a combined length of 70 li, with dense fish fry populations. Each net can catch approximately 10,000 fry per hour, with a maximum of 20,000 fry per hour. The quality of the fish fry is very good, with domestic fish accounting for 70% to 90%. Bighead carp and silver carp are the most abundant, while grass carp are less common. The natural environment of these three production areas is also very good, with smooth water flow and no backflow, making them ideal locations for catching fish fry. According to the survey data, the Jiangxi Provincial Aquatic Products Bureau plans to begin harvesting and production here next year to meet the large demand for fish fry from the province's freshwater aquaculture industry.

    新的鱼苗产地
    本报讯　在鱼苗盛产时期的五月，江西省水产局在本省长江一段及鄱阳湖出口处进行鱼苗资源调查工作，发现三处新的鱼苗产地：在湖口县以东二十华里的龙口江、钟教港及彭泽以西三华里的长江南岸（右星洲）。三处共长七十华里，鱼苗密集，每张网每小时约可捞一万尾，最高每小时达二万尾。鱼苗成色很好，家鱼占70％到90％。其中以花白鲢为多，青草鱼较少。这三处产地自然环境也很好，水流平稳，没有回流，是捕捞鱼苗的良好场所。根据调查资料，江西省水产局准备明年就在这里捕捞生产，以满足本省淡水养鱼业对鱼苗的大量需要。
