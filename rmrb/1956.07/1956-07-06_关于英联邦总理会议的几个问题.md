    Several Questions Regarding the Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference
    Question: What kind of meeting is the Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference?
    Answer: The Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference is a meeting held by the leaders of Britain and its dominions, as well as independent countries participating in the Commonwealth. This conference evolved from the Colonial Conference and the Imperial Conference. The first Colonial Conference was held in 1887. In 1907, it was renamed the Imperial Conference. In 1948, it was renamed the Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference. This type of conference convened by Britain is not an organ of power and has no legal binding force on member states.
    Question: Which countries are included in the membership of the Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference?
    Answer: The participants in the earliest Colonial Conference included the British Colonial Secretary and representatives from various colonies. During the "Imperial Conference" period, only representatives from Britain, its dominions, and India attended the meetings. At that time, the British dominions included the following countries: Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the Union of South Africa, Ireland, and Newfoundland. Ireland withdrew from the conference in 1937 after declaring itself an independent republic. Newfoundland also ceased to participate in the conference after relinquishing its dominion status in 1934. Burma and Southern Rhodesia once participated in the Imperial Conference.
    Since it was renamed the Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference, in addition to the original members of the Imperial Conference, Pakistan and Ceylon began to participate in the conference after obtaining dominion status. India and Pakistan declared themselves independent republics in 1950 and 1956 respectively, but remained members of the Commonwealth, so they continued to participate in the Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference. In 1953, after the British semi-autonomous territory of Southern Rhodesia, Northern Rhodesia, and the British protectorate of Nyasaland (in Central Africa) established the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland (also known as the Central African Federation), the Prime Minister of this federation also became a member of the Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference.
    Question: What issues are discussed at the Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference?
    Answer: The Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference has already been held six times, and the current meeting is the seventh. Each conference has discussed the international situation, financial economics, and issues related to the colonies. Britain hopes to strengthen internal Commonwealth relations and its international standing through the conferences. With the development of the international situation, the foreign policies of Commonwealth countries have occupied a prominent place on the agenda of the Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference.
    Question: What issues are being discussed at this Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference?
    Answer: According to British news agency reports, this Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference is mainly discussing the relationship between the East and the West in the new situation, especially the relationship with the Soviet Union and China, and the role of the Commonwealth between the Soviet Union and the United States. The conference also discussed the Middle East and Cyprus issues, the situation in Indochina, the situation in Singapore and Malaya, relations with Japan, and European security and disarmament. The economic problems of the Commonwealth, as well as "defense" and military alliance issues, are also important issues discussed at the conference. (Weng)

    关于英联邦总理会议的几个问题
    问：英联邦总理会议是怎样的一种会议？
    答：英联邦总理会议，是英国和英国自治领，以及参加英联邦的独立国家的领导人举行的会议。这个会议是由殖民地会议和帝国会议演变而来的。1887年举行了第一次殖民地会议。1907年改称帝国会议。1948年又改称英联邦总理会议。这种由英国召集的会议不是一种权力机关，对成员国没有法律上的约束力。
    问：英联邦总理会议的成员包括哪些国家？
    答：最早的殖民地会议的参加者，有英国殖民大臣和各殖民地的代表。到了“帝国会议”时期；仅由英国、各自治领和印度的代表出席会议。那时英国的自治领包括以下这些国家：加拿大、澳大利亚、新西兰、南非联邦、爱尔兰和纽芬兰。爱尔兰在1937年宣布成为独立共和国后就退出会议。纽芬兰在1934年放弃自治领地位后，也不再参加会议了。缅甸和南罗得西亚曾一度参加帝国会议。
    及至改称英联邦总理会议后，除了原来参加帝国会议的成员以外，巴基斯坦和锡兰由于取得了自治领的地位，开始参加会议。印度和巴基斯坦先后于1950年和1956年宣布成立独立的共和国，但仍为英联邦的一员，所以它们继续参加英联邦总理会议。1953年，英国的半自治领南罗得西亚、北罗得西亚和英国的保护国尼亚萨兰（在非洲中部）建立了罗得西亚及尼亚萨兰联邦（又称中非联邦）后，这个联邦的总理也成了英联邦总理会议的成员了。
    问：英联邦总理会议讨论些什么问题？
    答：英联邦总理会议已经举行过六次会议，现在举行的是第七次会议。每次会议都讨论了国际局势、财政经济和有关殖民地的问题。英国希望通过会议来加强英联邦内部关系和它在国际上的地位。随着国际局势的发展，英联邦国家的外交政策在联邦总理会议的议程上占有了突出的地位。
    问：这次英联邦总理会议讨论的是哪些问题？
    答：根据英国通讯社的报道，这次英联邦总理会议主要讨论在新的形势下东西方的关系问题，特别是同苏联和中国的关系问题和英联邦在苏美之间的作用问题。会议还讨论了中东和塞浦路斯问题、印度支那局势、新加坡和马来亚局势、对日本的关系、以及欧洲安全和裁军等问题。英联邦的经济问题，以及“防务”和军事联盟问题，也是会议讨论的重要问题。　（翁）
