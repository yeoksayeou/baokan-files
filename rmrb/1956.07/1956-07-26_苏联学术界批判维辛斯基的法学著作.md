    Soviet Academic Circles Criticize Vyshinsky's Legal Works
    The second issue of the "Soviet State and Law" magazine this year published an editorial entitled "The 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Tasks of Soviet Jurisprudence." The editorial, in discussing the issue of opposing the cult of personality, stated that excessively exaggerating the role of Academician Vyshinsky's scientific works, blindly worshipping the principles he advocated, turning some of his principles into dogmas, and remaining silent about the serious errors in his works had created an adverse impact on the development of Soviet jurisprudence.
    The editorial listed an erroneous principle of Academician Vyshinsky in the theory of Soviet procedural evidence. This is that he denied the need for the court to establish absolute truth in the trial of each case. He believed it permissible to convict based only on the probability of a certain fact as judged by the court. For example, Academician Vyshinsky wrote: "In the article 'Problems of Evidence Judgment in Soviet Criminal Procedure' in 1937, I took a negative attitude toward the question of whether it is appropriate and possible to require the court to determine absolute truth. Because 'the conditions of judicial activity make it necessary for the judge not to solve the problem from the viewpoint of absolute truth, but from the viewpoint of the maximum probability of a certain fact judged by the court (more correctly: from the viewpoint of credibility - Vyshinsky's note).' I still maintain this view. Requiring the court to make its judgment a reflection of absolute truth is obviously a task that cannot be completed under the conditions of judicial activity..." (A.Y. Vyshinsky: "The Theory of Procedural Evidence in Soviet Law," State Legal Books Publishing Bureau, Moscow, 3rd edition, 1950, p. 201)
    The editorial said that this argument runs counter to the requirements of the Party and the government to strictly abide by the legal system in the activities of investigation, trial, and procuratorial organs. In the past, the practice of convicting solely on the basis of the defendant's own confession had occurred in the work of investigation, trial, and procuratorial organs. This practice brutally violated the principles of the socialist legal system and the foundations of jurisprudence. Therefore, the editorial called on Soviet legal workers to deeply and comprehensively study and elaborate on the methods of safeguarding and guaranteeing the realization of the legal system in protecting the rights and interests of Soviet citizens. It called on them to overcome this type of erroneous principle existing in the theory of Soviet procedural evidence.
    In addition, the articles "The Work of Soviet Trials and Its Role in Consolidating the Legal System" (by R. Rakhunov) published in the seventh issue of the Soviet "Communist" magazine this year, and "The Issue of Objective Truth in the Theory of Criminal Procedure" (by A. Stalchenko) published in the second issue of the "Problems of Philosophy" magazine, also criticized Vyshinsky's erroneous principle.

### 苏联学术界批判维辛斯基的法学著作

    苏联学术界批判维辛斯基的法学著作
    今年第二期“苏维埃国家和法”杂志以“苏联共产党第二十次代表大会和苏维埃法学的任务”为题发表了社论。社论在谈到反对个人崇拜的问题时说，过分夸大维辛斯基院士的科学著作的作用，盲目崇拜他所主张的原理，把他的某些原理变成教条，对他著作中的严重错误闭口不谈，这在苏维埃法学的发展中造成了不良的影响。
    社论列举了维辛斯基院士在苏维埃诉讼证据理论方面的一个错误原理。这就是，他否认法院在审理每一个案件中有确立绝对真实的必要性，他认为准许只根据应经法院判断的某种事实的盖然性就可定罪的做法。比如维辛斯基院士曾写道：“1937年在‘苏维埃刑事诉讼中证据判决问题’一文里，我对于要求法院确定绝对真实是否适当和可能的问题，持否定态度。因为‘审判活动的条件使审判员不是必须从绝对真实的观点，而是要从由法院判断的某种事实的最大限度的盖然性的观点（更正确些说：从可信性的观点——维辛斯基注）来解决问题。’我现在仍然坚持这一看法。要求法院使它的判决成为绝对真实的体现，显然这一任务在审判活动的条件下是不能完成的……”（安·扬·维辛斯基：“苏维埃法律中的诉讼证据理论”，国家法律书籍出版局，莫斯科1950年第三版，第201页）
    社论说，这种主张是同党和政府关于在侦查、审判和检察机关的活动中必须严守法制的要求背道而驰。过去在侦查、审判和检察机关的工作中曾发生过仅仅凭被告本人的供认就定罪的做法。这种做法粗暴地破坏了社会主义法制原则和法学基础。因此，社论号召苏联法学工作者深入而全面地研究和阐述在保护苏联公民权利和利益问题上实现法制的保障和保证方法的问题。号召他们克服在苏维埃诉讼证据理论中存在的这一类错误原理。
    另外，今年第七期苏联“共产党人”杂志发表的“苏维埃的审判工作及其在巩固法制中的作用”
  （里·拉胡诺夫作）以及第二期“哲学问题”杂志发表的“刑事诉讼理论中的客观真实问题”（阿·斯塔尔钦柯作）两文，也对维辛斯基的这一错误原理作了批判。
