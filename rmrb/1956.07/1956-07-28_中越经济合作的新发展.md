    New Developments in Sino-Vietnamese Economic Cooperation
    On July 26th, the trade delegations of our country and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam signed a number of agreements in Hanoi regarding economic cooperation for 1956, including agreements on mutual supply of goods and payment, as well as a protocol on aid to Vietnam and a protocol on technical assistance to Vietnam in accordance with the joint Sino-Vietnamese government communique of last year. The signing of these agreements is a new symbol of the continuous development of the fraternal friendship and economic cooperation between China and Vietnam.
    In recent years, Sino-Vietnamese economic and cultural cooperation, conducted on the basis of equality, mutual benefit, and mutual assistance, has greatly developed. After the visit to our country by the government delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam led by President Ho Chi Minh last year, Sino-Vietnamese friendly relations entered a new stage. According to the joint Sino-Vietnamese government communique issued at that time, the Chinese government decided to provide the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam with a grant of 800 million yuan in Renminbi to assist the Vietnamese people in healing the wounds of prolonged war and restoring and developing the economy of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. Both sides agreed to conduct full cooperation in the economic and technical fields and to gradually expand trade between the two countries on the principle of equality and mutual benefit. The signing of the Sino-Vietnamese economic cooperation agreements this year fully embodies the spirit of the joint Sino-Vietnamese government communique. According to these agreements, the trade volume between China and Vietnam this year will greatly increase compared with last year, and economic and technical cooperation between China and Vietnam will also be greatly strengthened.
    Due to the rapid development of economic construction in both China and Vietnam, both sides now have the possibility of supplying each other with more goods than in the past. The increasingly rich experience accumulated by both countries in construction also provides more favorable conditions for technical exchanges between the two sides. In the past, Vietnam supplied our country with many mineral products, forest products, agricultural and sideline products, tropical crops, and some industrial products. Among the goods supplied to our country this year are the world-famous Hong Gai anthracite coal, high-quality chromite sand, cement and apatite for fertilizer raw materials, hardwood timbers suitable for shipbuilding, and valuable medicinal materials such as cardamom. These goods are much needed by our country. According to this agreement, our country will continue to supply the Democratic Republic of Vietnam with steel, machine tools, machinery, locomotives, vehicles, ships, and other equipment needed for the development of industrial and agricultural production and transportation; and will send experts and technicians in industry, agriculture, water conservancy, transportation, and postal and telecommunications to Vietnam to provide technical assistance, while accepting interns sent by the Vietnamese side to factories and mines in our country for production internships.
    The signing of the 1956 Sino-Vietnamese economic cooperation agreements is of great significance for further developing the economies of the two countries and improving the living standards of the two peoples. The continuous development of Sino-Vietnamese economic cooperation will strengthen the power of the socialist camp, thereby contributing to the cause of world peace.

    中越经济合作的新发展
    七月二十六日，我国和越南民主共和国双方的贸易代表团，在河内签订了1956年两国经济合作的各项协定，其中包括互相供应货物和付款协定，以及根据去年中越两国政府联合公报签订的援助越南议定书和给予越南技术援助议定书。这些协定的签订，是中越两国兄弟般的友好关系和经济合作不断发展的新标志。
    近几年来，中越两国在平等互利互相帮助的基础上进行的经济和文化合作，有了很大的发展。去年由胡志明主席率领的越南民主共和国政府代表团访问我国后，中越两国友好关系进入了新的阶段。根据当时发表的中越两国政府联合公报，我国政府决定以人民币八亿元无偿地赠送给越南民主共和国政府，协助越南人民医治长期战争的创伤，恢复和发展越南民主共和国的经济。双方协议，两国在经济上和技术上进行充分的合作，并根据平等互利原则逐步扩大两国之间的贸易。今年中越两国经济合作的各项协定的签订，充分体现了中越两国政府联合公报的精神。根据这些协定，中越两国今年的贸易额将比去年有很大的增加，中越两国在经济上和技术上的合作也将大大加强。
    由于中越两国经济建设的迅速发展，现在双方都有了比过去互相供给更多的货物的可能了。两国在建设中积累的越来越丰富的经验，也为双方的技术交流提供了更加有利的条件。越南过去曾经供应过我国很多矿产品、林产品、农副业产品、热带作物和部分工业产品。在今年供应我国的货物中，还有世界著名的鸿基无烟煤，质量优良的铬矿砂，水泥和肥田粉原料磷灰石，质量坚硬、可造船舶的木材和贵重药材砂仁等，这些货物多是我国十分需要的。根据这次协定，我国也将继续供应越南民主共和国所需要的钢材、机床、机器、机车、车辆、船只，以及其它发展工农业生产和交通运输业所需要的器材；并且将派遣工业、农业、水利、交通运输和邮电等方面的专家和技术人员到越南进行技术援助，同时接受越南方面派到我国厂矿进行生产实习的实习生。
    1956年中越两国经济合作各项协定的签订，对于进一步发展两国经济和改善两国人民生活有着重大的意义。中越两国经济合作的不断发展，将加强社会主义阵营的力量，从而有助于世界的和平事业。
