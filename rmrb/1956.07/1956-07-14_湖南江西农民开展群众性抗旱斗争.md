Hunan and Jiangxi Farmers Launch Mass Drought Resistance Campaign

    (Report from our newspaper) The vast number of farmers in Hunan Province are currently fighting against drought and insect pests. For the past twenty days or so, most parts of the province have not received any rainfall, leaving more than three million mu of rice paddies short of water, with thirty thousand mu already cracked due to dryness. At the same time, various insect pests have infested three million mu of fields across the province. Hunan Province expanded its double-cropping rice acreage by fifteen million mu this year, and the early rice is nearing maturity with a promising harvest. However, the recent drought and insect pests have seriously impacted the production of mid-season and late-season rice. In areas threatened by drought and insect pests, large-scale actions to combat these disasters have been fully launched. All the pumps at the province's two hundred and forty pumping stations are operating at full capacity, and all water reservoirs, siphon pipes, and other water conservancy facilities are being utilized. In late June, the Changde Special District mobilized more than nine hundred thousand people to carry water to combat the drought, and the threat of drought has been alleviated for sixty percent of the rice paddies. In the drought resistance effort, the Yuanjiang Agricultural Cooperative in Qianyang County found three water sources and repaired small canals, ensuring that the cooperative's rice paddies receive sufficient water. While combating the drought, farmers in various areas have also achieved results in pest control. More than four hundred agricultural cooperatives in Liling, Yueyang, and Youxian have made full use of pesticides and equipment for pest control, and mobilized the masses to capture and eliminate pests, eradicating insect pests from more than two hundred and twenty thousand mu of fields. Currently, the weather in Hunan remains persistently sunny with no rain, and the drought situation continues to develop. Leaders at all levels are continuing to organize forces to fight against the natural disasters.
    (Report from our newspaper) In Jiangxi Province, except for isolated areas that experienced heavy rainfall, other regions have not received rain in the past twenty days. According to incomplete statistics, the drought-affected area in the province has reached more than one million mu. To prevent the drought from continuing to expand, overcome the threat of drought, ensure a bumper harvest of early rice, promote the healthy growth of mid-season and late-season rice, and ensure the timely completion of sowing and planting tasks for double-season late rice and other various autumn-ripening crops, all localities have made leading the masses in carrying out drought resistance and prevention efforts one of the central tasks of current agricultural production. The CPC Ji'an Prefectural Committee has issued two urgent instructions to various counties, requiring them to suspend all meetings, go deep into the countryside to lead the masses in drought resistance, and put forward the slogan "The whole Party mobilizes, the secretary takes the lead, we will not retreat until we conquer the drought." Eighty cadres have been dispatched to the countryside, and each county has established a drought resistance headquarters to lead the drought resistance and prevention work. Members of the CPC prefectural and county committees are mostly leading cadres to the countryside to guide the masses in drought resistance. At present, mass drought resistance movements involving tens of thousands of people and thousands of vehicles have been launched in the drought-affected areas. Under the action slogan of "Carrying water is like carrying grain, one drop of water is one grain," all localities are required to "People stop, machines don't stop, we will not retreat while there is drought" and "Resist when there is drought, prevent when there is no drought" to ensure an all-round bumper harvest. In the Nanchang Special District, the number of people participating in drought resistance efforts every day has reached more than two hundred and sixty thousand, and more than seventy thousand pieces of drought resistance equipment such as waterwheels and treadmills have been mobilized. In Fengcheng County alone, more than seventy thousand men and women laborers and more than thirty thousand pieces of various drought resistance equipment are mobilized every day, and all eighteen pumping stations in the county are operating day and night to help the masses carry water for drought resistance. Thanks to the mass rescue efforts, more than four hundred and eighty thousand mu of rice threatened by drought have been saved in the entire special district.

    本报讯　江西省二十天来除个别地区曾降暴雨外，其他各地都未降雨。据不完全统计，全省受旱面积已达百万亩以上。为制止旱象继续扩大，战胜干旱威胁，确保早稻丰收，中、晚稻的生长良好，以及二季晚稻和其它各种秋熟作物能及时完成播种和栽植任务，各地均把领导群众开展抗旱防旱斗争，作为当前农业生产的中心任务之一，中共吉安地委已两度紧急指示各县，要求停止一切会议，深入乡村领导群众抗旱，并提出了“全党动手，书记带头，不战胜干旱，决不收兵”的口号。并抽调了八十名干部下乡，各县均成立了抗旱指挥部领导抗旱防旱工作。各地中共地、县委委员大都率领干部下乡领导群众抗旱。目前，各受旱地区已掀起了万人千车的群众性抗旱运动，在“车水如车谷、一滴水一粒谷”的行动口号下各地都要求做到“人停车不停，有旱不收兵”和“有旱则抗，无旱则防”，保证全面丰收。南昌专区全区每天参加抗旱斗争的人数已达二十六万多人，出动水车、足车等抗旱工具七万多件。仅丰城一县每天就出动男女劳力七万多人，各种抗旱工具三万多件，全县十八部抽水机正日夜运转不停的帮助群众车水抗旱。由于群众大力抢救，全专区已挽救受干旱威胁的水稻四十八万多亩。
