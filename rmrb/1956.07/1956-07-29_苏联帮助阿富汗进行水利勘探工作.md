Xinhua News Agency, Kabul, July 27th (TASS): Representatives of the Soviet Technical Export Company and the Afghan Ministry of Public Works signed a contract in Kabul on July 26th, stipulating that Soviet experts will assist Afghanistan in the exploration of water conservancy projects.

Soviet experts will conduct exploration work for the construction of irrigation canals in the Jalalabad area. The first phase of this irrigation canal project, when completed, can irrigate approximately 20,000 hectares of fertile land for two crops a year. In addition, exploration work will be carried out for the construction of dams and reservoirs on the Paletu River.

The construction of reservoirs will expand the irrigated area. A reservoir to be built in the Hawar area is initially estimated to hold 40 million cubic meters of water. The above-mentioned water conservancy projects will bring huge economic benefits to the country and improve the people's welfare.

The costs of the above projects are provided by Soviet loans.
