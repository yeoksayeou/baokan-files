　　Fighting Natural Disasters to Ensure Agricultural Production

　　Sixteen Thousand Hectares of Land in Jilin Flooded; 200,000 People Mobilized to Rescue Farmland

　　Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, July 29th (Reporter Cao Ke): Flood prevention work in Jilin Province has entered a critical stage, urgently requiring strengthened drainage and protection of agricultural producers' cooperative reservoirs.

　　As of the 26th, the floods in several major rivers, including the Songhua River and Nen River, have reached or approached the highest water levels in past years. The large and small dikes built along the rivers over the years are resisting the surging floods. However, in some smaller rivers or low-lying areas, due to sudden heavy rains and insufficient attention to flood and waterlogging prevention in these areas, some small rivers have breached their banks, and some low-lying areas have formed inland waterlogging. Some agricultural producers' cooperative reservoirs have also experienced breaches due to poor engineering quality and lack of management experience. A total of 160,000 hectares of land in the province has been flooded. Currently, various localities are rapidly mobilizing to intensify flood and waterlogging prevention. Approximately 200,000 people are battling the rain along the rivers, and more than 40,000 hectares of farmland have been rescued.

　　Jilin Province has made many efforts in flood prevention work in recent years. In particular, the 415-kilometer-long Songhua River levee was completed this year, and many dikes have been built on larger rivers such as the Nen River. After seeing these favorable conditions, many cadres relaxed their flood prevention work. Therefore, when the rainy season with frequent torrential rains arrived this year, although the larger rivers such as the Songhua River and Nen River resisted the floods due to the construction of dikes and dams, the phenomenon of river water overflowing and breaches occurred in some smaller rivers. Some agricultural producers' cooperative reservoirs also breached their banks, and rainwater could not be discharged in low-lying areas, forming inland waterlogging and causing floods.

　　Rising River Levels Continue in Heilongjiang
　　Huma County Seat Entirely Submerged

　　Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, July 29th: Heilongjiang Province has been experiencing continuous overcast and rainy weather recently, and inland waterlogging has occurred in some areas. In the Hejiang area, several rivers have overflowed their banks one after another, submerging some farmland and a small number of villages, and destroying some water conservancy projects. In the Nenjiang area, as of late July, approximately 2% of the total cultivated land area in the area had been flooded or submerged. In Qinggang County, seven villages were completely waterlogged, and two of them were completely submerged. The most severely threatened by floods is the northern Heihe area. The Huma county seat in this area was completely submerged on the 14th. The town of Mohe in this county was also 70% submerged by the flood on July 24th. According to very incomplete statistics, more than 70,000 hectares of farmland and more than 20 villages have been submerged throughout the province, and the area affected by waterlogging is even larger. Currently, the water situation is continuing to develop in the riverine and waterlogged areas, and the water levels of the Songhua River, Nen River, and other rivers are continuously rising.

　　The leading organs of Heilongjiang Province and the Party and government leading organs in the waterlogged areas are taking emergency measures to rescue the situation and are organizing a large number of people to carry out drainage.

　　Up to now, except for the waterlogged and submerged areas, various crops throughout the province are still generally growing well. If the rain and waterlogging can be overcome, a bumper harvest is expected. Due to the heavy rain and high water levels, the summer hoeing and wheat harvesting work currently underway have been greatly affected. In particular, wheat in some areas may experience a phenomenon where a bumper harvest cannot be realized.

　　Welcome Rain Eases Drought in Fujian

　　Our newspaper, Fuzhou, July 28th: Most areas of Fujian Province received welcome rain on the 26th and 27th.

　　Prior to this, there had been no rain in the province for more than two months, and drought was very widespread, causing some middle-season rice interplanted with late-season rice, sweet potatoes, peanuts, and other crops to suffer from drought. Summer planting work was also affected. After the rainfall, the drought situation throughout the province has eased to varying degrees, and the drought in some areas has been basically relieved. On the evening of the 27th, the Provincial Department of Agriculture issued an urgent notice to all localities, requiring them to seize the opportunity, take advantage of the rain to rush plowing, rush planting, conserve water, cultivate, and weed, and do a good job of summer planting and field management in a timely manner.

　　Henan Carries Out Drought and Flood Prevention Simultaneously

　　Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, July 28th: At present, Henan Province is in the middle of the dog days, a season prone to both waterlogging and drought. In order to enable the autumn seedlings to grow vigorously in such a season, members of agricultural cooperatives in various localities are widely carrying out drought prevention, flood prevention, and preparing for drainage activities.

　　In the plains area, more than one million water wells completed last winter and this spring are being intensified in the manufacture and installation of water lifting tools in preparation for use in drought resistance. Farmers have already begun irrigating autumn seedlings in areas along the Yellow River where drought has appeared. The larger canals in the Xinxiang area, such as the Dandong, Guangli, Baiquan, and Yellow River diversion canals, have all begun irrigation. The Baisha irrigation canal, which uses floodwater impounded by the Baisha Reservoir on the Huai River for irrigation, began watering fields on the 23rd and plans to irrigate 280,000 mu within ten days.

　　Many areas with heavy rain and tense water conditions are carrying out flood prevention activities. The recent heavy rain in the upper reaches of the Zhang River in northern Henan caused the largest flood in the history of hydrological records of this river. The people along the river immediately shifted from the drought prevention struggle to the flood prevention and rescue struggle. Eight thousand farmers along the Huai River in the Xinyang area are working intensely to repair dikes, plug breaches, patrol dikes, and inspect water conditions to ensure agricultural production on both sides of the river.

　　Zhejiang Launches Mass Drought Resistance Struggle

　　Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, July 28th: A mass drought resistance struggle has been widely launched in the drought-stricken areas south of the Qiantang River in Zhejiang Province. On the vast fields, the water pipes of pumping stations spew out rolling water, and tens of thousands of waterwheels cough out silver-like flowing water. The battle cry of "Resolutely not withdraw troops without defeating the drought" has become the actual action of the vast number of farmers.

　　The Lianlian Agricultural Producers' Cooperative in Shuige Township, Lishui County, used 15 waterwheels to turn the river water over the mountains and irrigate the dry fields. The No. 1 Agricultural Cooperative in Qiancang Township, Pingyang County, deepened the bottom of three small rivers, causing the river water to flow backwards into the fields. Farmers in Longyou and other thirteen counties have rescued more than 40,000 mu of farmland by carrying water, loosening soil, and cutting grass to cover the fields. Nine counties in the Jinhua area have rescued 240,000 mu of drought-stricken farmland.

　　Since late June, Zhejiang Province, except for the northwest and Zhoushan areas, has been lacking rainfall, and the outdoor temperature is often above 100 degrees Fahrenheit, with water evaporation reaching about 8 millimeters. At present, a considerable portion of the rice paddies in the province are threatened by drought. According to meteorological department forecasts, there will still be very little rainfall in the near future. Yesterday, the Zhejiang Provincial People's Committee issued instructions on strengthening drought and drought prevention work to ensure a bumper harvest in agriculture, requiring all localities to take drought and drought prevention work as the current central task in rural areas, and requiring areas with severe drought and lack of water sources to make preparations for changing crops and replanting in a timely manner.

    同天灾作斗争　保障农业生产
    吉林十六万公顷土地被淹二十万人动员起来抢救农田
    据新华社长春29日电　新华社记者曹科报道：吉林省防汛工作进入了紧张阶段，急须要加强排涝和保护农业生产合作社的水库。
    到二十六日为止，松花江、嫩江等几支较大的河流的洪水都达到或接近了历年的最高水位，沿江连年筑起的大小堤防正在抗御着汹涌的洪水。但在一些较小的河流或低洼地带，由于骤降急雨，加上这些地区对防汛和防涝重视不够，有些小河决了堤，部分洼地形成了内涝，有的农业生产合作社的水库由于工程质量不好和缺乏管理经验，也发生了决堤事件。全省已有十六万公顷土地被淹。现在，各地正在迅速动员起来加紧防汛与排涝，全省约有二十万人在沿河一带和雨水搏斗，已抢救出农田四万多公顷。
    吉林省在近年来在防汛工作上作了很多的努力。特别是今年完成了长达四百一十五公里的松花江大堤，在嫩江等较大的河流上都建立了不少堤防。许多干部看到这些有利的条件后，对防汛工作就松懈下来。因此，今年多暴雨性的雨季一来，松花江，嫩江等较大的河流由于建立堤坝虽然抗拒着洪水，可是，在一些较小的河流上就发生了河水出槽、决堤现象，有些农业生产合作社的水库也决了口，低洼地区的雨水不能排泄形成了内涝，造成了水灾。
  黑龙江各河继续上涨
      呼玛县城全部被淹
    新华社哈尔滨29日电　黑龙江省近来阴雨连绵，部分地区发生内涝。合江专区已有好几条河流河水先后出槽，淹没了部分农田和少数村庄，冲毁了一些水利工程。嫩江专区到七月下旬已有约占全区总耕地面积2％的庄稼受涝或被淹，青冈县的有七个村全部受涝，其中两个村全部被淹。受洪水威胁最严重的是北部黑河专区。这个专区的呼玛县城，在十四日全部被淹。这个县的谟河镇也在七月二十四日被大水淹没了70％。全省据极不完全统计，已有七万多公顷农田和二十多个村庄被淹没，受涝的面积更大。目前沿河地区和受涝地区水情还在继续发展，松花江、嫩江等江河水位不断上涨。
    黑龙江省领导机关和受涝地区的党政领导机关正采取紧急措施加以抢救，并组织大量的人力进行排涝。
    到目前止，除受涝被淹地方外，全省各种作物仍然普遍生长良好，如能战胜雨涝，可望丰收。由于雨多水大，当前正在进行的夏锄和麦收工作受到极大影响，特别是某些地区的小麦可能造成丰产不能丰收的现象。
    福建喜雨旱象缓和
    本报福州28日电　二十六日到二十七日福建省大部分地区都降了喜雨。
    在此以前全省已有两个多月没有下雨，旱象十分普遍，使部分中稻间作晚稻、甘薯、花生等作物受旱，夏种工作也受到影响。降雨以后，全省旱象已有不同程度的缓和，部分地区干旱已基本解除。二十七日晚上，省农业厅已向各地发出紧急通知，要求各地抓紧时机，乘雨抢犁、抢种、保水蓄水、中耕、除草，不失时宜地做好夏种和田间管理工作。河南防旱防汛同时进行
    新华社郑州28日电　目前，河南省正处于易涝又易旱的中伏季节。各地农业社的社员们为使秋苗能够在这样的季节里旺盛生长，正广泛开展防旱、防汛和准备排涝的活动。
    在平原区，去冬今春完成的一百多万眼水井都在加紧制造和安装提水工具，预备在抗旱时使用。黄河两岸已经出现旱象的地区，农民已经开始灌溉秋苗。新乡专区的丹东、广利、百泉、引黄等较大的渠道都已开始灌溉。淮河上利用白沙水库拦蓄的洪水进行灌溉的白沙灌溉渠，自二十三日起已开始浇地，计划在十天内灌溉二十八万亩。
    许多雨多水情紧张的地区正在进行防汛活动。河南北部的漳河上游最近的一次大雨，造成了这条河流自有水文纪录以来的最大一次洪水，沿河人民立即从防旱斗争中投入防汛抢险斗争。信阳专区淮河沿岸八万名农民正在紧张地修堤堵口，巡堤查水，以保障河流两岸的农业生产。浙江展开群众性防旱抗旱斗争
    新华社杭州28日电　群众性的抗旱斗争已在浙江省钱塘江以南受旱地区广泛展开。广阔的田野上，抽水机的水管喷出滚滚的水头，成千上万部水车呼呼地吐出银练似的流水。“不战胜旱灾坚决不收兵”的战斗口号，已成为广大农民的实际行动。
    丽水县水阁乡联联农业生产合作社用十五部水车把河水翻过山岭，浇灌干旱的田地。平阳县钱仓乡第一农业社挖深了三处小河的河底，使大河的河水倒流灌田。龙游等十三个县的农民用挑水、松土和割草铺田等办法，抢救出了四万多亩农田。金华专区的九个县已抢救出受旱农田二十四万亩。
    六月下旬以来，浙江省除西北部和舟山地区以外，雨水缺少，室外温度经常在华氏一百度以上，水份的蒸发量达到八公厘左右。目前全省已有相当大的一部分稻田受到干旱威胁。根据气象部门预测，最近期内，雨量仍然很少。昨天，浙江省人民委员会发出了关于加强抗旱防旱工作、保证农业丰收的指示，要求各地把防旱抗旱工作作为当前农村中心任务，并要求缺乏水源旱情严重地区及时做好改种、补种准备。
