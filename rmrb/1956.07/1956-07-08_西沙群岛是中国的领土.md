    The Xisha Islands are China's Territory
    Shao Xunzheng
    The Xisha Islands, like the Dongsha, Zhongsha, and Nansha Islands, are indisputably Chinese territory. The name "Qizhou Yang," which the Chinese people habitually use to refer to the Xisha Islands, has appeared continuously in Chinese historical and geographical records since at least the 13th century.
    Everyone knows that the "Qizhou Yang" in Chinese historical records is the Xisha Islands. The earliest definite record should be the Biography of Shi Bi in the History of the Yuan Dynasty (compiled in the Ming Dynasty, but based on Yuan Dynasty materials). The biography records that in 1292, Yuan General Shi Bi led troops to sail "past Qizhou Yang, Wanli Shitang, and through Champa" to attack Java. Chinese and foreign scholars have confirmed that Qizhou Yang refers to the Xisha Islands. Wang Dayuan's "Daoyi Zhilüe" of 1349 recorded a Chinese maritime proverb, the first two lines of which are "Above are Qizhou (should be 'Zhou'), below are Kunlun." This and Fei Xin's record in his "Xingcha Shenglan," which he wrote while following Zheng He on his voyages to the Western Seas in the 15th century, "It is commonly said: one fears Qizhou above, and Kunlun below; if the compass is lost and the rudder fails, people and ships will perish," clearly share a common origin. The "Qizhou" mentioned here is "Qizhou Yang." Fei Xin himself certainly went to Qizhou Yang, as it was a necessary stop on the maritime route at that time. The "Wubei Zhi," written by Mao Yuanyi in 1621, transcribed a map drawn by Zheng He at that time, which recorded the names "Qizhou" and "Wanli Shitang." Scholars believe that the various island groups in the South China Sea were incorporated into the Chinese territory during the Ming Dynasty. There were often Chinese people in the Xisha Islands during the Ming Dynasty. For example, a batch of Ming Dynasty copper coins, "Yongle Tongbao," found under a living coral reef there, has been verified by scholars as most likely belonging to Chinese fishermen residing on the islands at that time. Ming Dynasty navigators and coastal people were familiar with Qizhou Yang. For example, Huang Zhong's "Hai Yu" of 1536 (Baoyantang Secret Collection edition) said: "From the Nanting Gate of Dongguan, sail to the ocean to Wuzhu, Duzhu, Qizhou (three ocean names), use the compass to the Kun Wei needle to Wailuo, Kun Jia needle forty-five legs to Old Port of Champa," which very accurately stated the location of Qizhou Yang. The coastal people of the Qing Dynasty were no less familiar with Qizhou Yang and other island groups in the South China Sea than those of the Ming Dynasty. Chen Lunhong's "Hai Guo Wen Jian Lu," recorded around 1730, and Yang Bingnan's "Hai Lu," narrated by navigator Xie Qinggao in 1820, both contain more records of Qizhou Yang. The attached map of "Hai Guo Wen Jian Lu" clearly lists Qizhou Yang, "Wanli Changsha," and "Qianli Shitang," namely the Xisha Islands, Zhongsha Islands, and Nansha Islands, as coastal islands of China and includes them in Chinese territory.
    The "Complete Geographical Treatise of the Chinese Empire" (written by French Jesuit priest Henri Havret), originally in French in 1905 and translated into English in 1908, correctly equated "Qizhou Yang" with "Paracel Islands" (i.e., the Xisha Islands). Moreover, the names "Qizhou Yang," "Changsha," and "Shitang" had long been recorded on Chinese maps. In addition to the maps of Zheng He in the Ming Dynasty and Chen Lunhong in the Qing Dynasty mentioned above, there are also various maps drawn by Shi Yongtu, Fu Yu, and others in the Qing Dynasty, which are well-known to Chinese and foreign scholars, all proving that these islands have always been Chinese territory.
    By the 19th century, Western countries began to pay attention to the islands in the South China Sea. In 1808, a British warship first measured the Xisha Islands. After the First Opium War, British warships continuously investigated and measured the islands in the South China Sea from 1844 to 1867. In 1868, the British Admiralty first published the "China Sea Pilot." In 1883, Germany also conducted surveys and measurements of the islands in the South China Sea, including the Xisha and Nansha Islands. This survey attracted the attention of the Chinese government at that time. After the Guangdong authorities protested to the German side, Germany stopped the survey (see "Compilation of Cases on the Xisha and Dongsha Islands" compiled by the Guangdong Department of Industry). Although some people in Western countries privately measured these Chinese islands for reasons such as navigation safety, just like they privately measured China's long coastline many times, and although they arbitrarily gave these islands some Western names on the map for convenience, just like they gave Western names to many coastal bays and other islands in China, the fact that the sovereignty of these islands belonged to China was recognized by all countries. For example, Article 3 of the "Sino-French Border Convention" of 1887 stipulated the boundary line, stating that "islands in the sea to the east of this line belong to China, and Jiutoushan (Vietnamese name Geduo) and other small islands in the sea to the west of this line belong to Vietnam." The Xisha and Nansha Islands are all east of the boundary line, and according to the treaty, they naturally belong to China, not Vietnam. This treaty was public, and no country at that time or afterwards questioned or objected to this treaty. From this, it can be seen that China's sovereignty over these islands has never been a problem.
    In the early 20th century, the great powers were eyeing China's borders and territorial waters. From 1907, Chinese officials also paid special attention to the security of the islands in the South China Sea. Therefore, Li Zhun, the Admiral of the Guangdong Navy, led the warships "Fubo" and "Chenhang" to inspect the Xisha Islands under the order of Zhang Renjun, the Governor of Guangdong, and also held a grand ceremony, firing cannons and raising flags on Dong Island and Lin Island, and naming and inscribing the islands on stone. This was only to prevent the coveting of foreign ambitious people at that time, and it does not mean that the Xisha Islands were officially incorporated into Chinese territory at this time. Prior to this, in 1908, the Chinese Customs had requested the Chinese government to build lighthouses on the islands at the request of various countries to ensure navigation safety, but this was not implemented. In 1930, a Far East Meteorological Observatory conference was held in Hong Kong, and the French representative suggested to China that a meteorological station be established in the Xisha Islands. Although Japanese merchants came to Xisha to exploit and manage the islands from 1921 to 1926, attempting to seize them, they finally withdrew under the opposition of the Chinese people. The Japanese government at that time did not dare to deliberately question China's sovereignty over the Xisha Islands.
    From 1930, France successively occupied nine islands in the Nansha Islands (then called the Tuan Sha Islands). Nansha and Xisha are 350 nautical miles apart, but the French knew they were unreasonable and wanted to confuse the issue by deliberately misrepresenting the facts, and further confused Xisha and Nansha, and even told the Chinese Embassy in France in January 1932 that the Xisha Islands had been occupied by troops sent by Vietnamese King Nguyen Phuc Anh and should belong to Vietnam. This statement is extremely absurd. Not only did Nguyen Phuc Anh not occupy the Xisha Islands, but it was also clearly impossible for him to do so. France's fabricated remarks were obviously based on the fallacy of a French Catholic priest, Bishop D'Espagnac, residing in Vietnam, who misinterpreted Vietnamese historical materials. D'Espagnac's "Geography of Vietnam" (in French, with an English translation, published in 1838) had been published for nearly a hundred years and had never been valued by scholars. It was only in 1929, when France decided to invade and occupy the Xisha and Nansha Islands due to their strategic importance, that they thought of using this worthless opinion as a basis and ordered a detailed investigation of old Vietnamese archives to find some materials that were irrelevant to the Xisha Islands for misinterpretation. France's unreasonable demands were severely refuted by the Chinese side at that time. ("Diplomatic Review," November 1933, p. 71)
    In 1933, France made an unreasonable demand for the Xisha Islands, but did not carry out a military occupation as promoted by the South Vietnamese Ngo Dinh Diem group recently. The propaganda of the Ngo Dinh Diem group is almost completely reversing the facts. For example, in 1929, the Xisha Islands were completely under Chinese control. The "under the jurisdiction of the Rach Gia Province of Vietnam" mentioned by the Ngo Dinh Diem group is just a blueprint prepared by the deliberate invaders themselves. In fact, on April 13, 1930, France only began to forcibly occupy Nanwei Island in the Nansha Islands and had not yet invaded the Xisha Islands. At that time, the Chinese Embassy in Paris refuted France's demands for the Xisha Islands, and France did not reply, rather than "China did not protest to France." France's conspiracy failed because Japan invaded the Xisha Islands in 1939 and drove out the French troops occupying the Nansha Islands. When Japan surrendered in 1945, from December 1946 to January 1947, with the recognition of various countries, China dispatched the navy to officially take over the islands in the South China Sea and stationed troops on some islands. However, the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs unreasonably claimed on January 9, 1947, that "the Xisha Islands should belong to France." The Chinese Embassy in France officially stated on the 17th of the same month that "the Xisha Islands have always been under Chinese sovereignty, and the Chinese government does not recognize France's claim to the islands." However, soon the French navy unreasonably landed on Coral Island ("Pattle Island") in the Xisha Islands, confronting our navy stationed on Yongxing Island ("Woody Island"). On the 21st of the same month, the then Chinese Foreign Minister met with French Minister to China, Mérillon, and solemnly stated that the sovereignty of the Xisha Islands belonged to China and questioned the meaning of the French navy's actions. Mérillon replied that "the actions of the French navy in the Xisha Islands were not instructed by the French government." ("Central Daily News," January 22, 1947). Later, France, knowing that it was unjustified, tried to avoid direct negotiations and unreasonably proposed to resolve this non-existent "dispute" through international arbitration. This was rejected by China at that time. It is extremely obvious that this series of conspiracies and actions by France were unreasonable and seriously infringed on China's sovereignty.
    There is no doubt that the Xisha Islands have long been Chinese territory. This can be verified not only by Chinese maps and records, but also by the research of scholars from various countries and historical records. Chinese and foreign books also unanimously record the continuous activities of the Chinese people on these islands. China's sovereignty over the Xisha Islands has always been recognized by all countries, and for France, there are also treaty-based grounds and obligations. Especially after World War II, the Xisha Islands, like the Nansha Islands, had already been formally returned to China through legitimate and complete procedures. The "claims" put forward by the Ngo Dinh Diem group today have long been proven to be nonsense. Of course, behind the Ngo Dinh Diem group stands its instigator, some warmongers in the United States. They also shamelessly published some absurd claims. But they should know that no fabricated reason can cover up such an obvious attempt at plunder. China will never tolerate this act of aggression in order to defend its indisputable sovereignty. (Attached picture)

    西沙群岛是中国的领土
    邵循正
    西沙群岛和东沙、中沙、南沙等群岛一样，无可争辩地是中国的领土。中国人习惯用以称呼西沙群岛的“七洲洋”这个名称，至晚从十三世纪开始就不断的出现在中国历史、地理等载籍中。
    大家都知道中国史籍上的“七洲洋”就是西沙群岛。最早的确切记载，应该说是元史（明代修，但根据元代资料）史弼传。传中记载：1292年，元将史弼率领军队航海“过七洲洋、万里石塘，历占城，”进攻爪哇。中外学者考订七洲洋都认为是西沙群岛。1349年的汪大渊“岛夷志略”记中国航海人民的谚语，头两句是“上有七州（应作“洲”）下有昆仑”。这和十五世纪跟随郑和下西洋的费信在他的“星槎胜览”中所记的，“俗云：上怕七洲，下怕昆仑，针迷舵失，人船莫存”，显出一源，这里所谓的“七洲”，就是“七洲洋”。费信这几句话可能是从汪大渊书上转录的，但他自己确是到过七洲洋，因为这是当时航路所必经的。1621年茅元仪撰的“武备志”转录有郑和当时所绘的地图，图上就著录有“七洲”、“万里石塘”的名称。学者认为南中国海的各岛群，在明代已被收入中国版图。西沙群岛上明代就经常有中国人，如前此在该处一个活珊瑚礁下发现的一批明代铜钱“永乐通宝”，已经学者考证，认为最可能是属于当时居留岛上的中国渔民的。明代航海家和沿海人民都熟知七洲洋，如1536年的黄衷“海语”（宝颜堂秘笈本）说：“自东莞之南亭门放洋至乌潴、独潴、七洲（三洋名），星盘坤未针至外罗，坤甲针四十五程至占城旧港”，就很确切地说出七洲洋的方位。清代沿海人民对七洲洋和南中国海其他岛群的熟悉决不下于明代。1730年左右，陈伦炯所记的“海国闻见录”和1820年杨炳南所记的航海家谢清高口述的“海录”，对七洲洋都有更多的记载。“海国闻见录”的附图中，更是清楚地将七洲洋和“万里长沙”和“千里石塘”，即西沙群岛、中沙群岛、南沙群岛都作为中国沿海岛屿而列入中国版图的。
    1905年法文原本和1908年英译的“中国坤輿详志”（法国耶稣会教士夏之时著），把“七洲洋”正式比定于“帕拉色尔岛”（即西沙群岛）这是对的。而且“七洲洋”和“长沙”“石塘”等名称都早已著录在中国的地图上。除了上面所举的明代郑和和清代陈伦炯的地图外，还有清代施永图、傅禹等人所绘的，也是中外学者所熟知的各项地图，都证明了这些岛屿一直是中国的领土。
    到了十九世纪，西方国家开始注意南中国海的岛屿。1808年英舰初次测量西沙群岛。第一次鸦片战争后，从1844年到1867年英舰不断调查测量南中国海的岛屿。1868年，英国海军部初次出版了“中国海指南”。1883年德国也进行了对南中国海各岛屿包括西沙、南沙群岛的调查测量工作，这次测量引起了当时中国政府的注意，经广东当局向德国方面抗议后，德国停止调查（见广东实业厅编，“西沙岛东沙岛成案章编”）。西方国家的一些人虽然曾经以航行安全等理由私自测量中国的这些岛屿，和他们许多次私自测量中国绵长的海岸线一样，他们虽然在地图上也曾经为方便起见替这些岛屿随意起了一些西文的名称，就像他们把中国许多沿海港湾和其他岛屿起了西文的名称一样，但这些岛屿的主权属于中国的事实，是各国所公认的。如1887年的“中法界务专条”第三款中规定了界线，说明“该线以东海中各岛归中国，该线以西，海中九头山（越名格多）及各小岛归越南”。西沙、南沙等群岛都在界线之东，照约文说，当然是属于中国，而不是属于越南的。这个条约是公开的，当时和事后没有任何国家对这约文发生过疑问或是提出了异议。由此也可以看出中国对这些岛屿的主权是从来不成问题的。
    到了二十世纪初叶，列强环伺中国的边境和海疆。从1907年起中国官方也特别注意南中国海各岛屿的安全问题。因此中国广东水师提督李准奉粤督张人骏命率领“伏波”“琛航”两舰前往西沙群岛视察，还特别举行了一次隆重的典礼，在东岛和林岛上鸣炮升旗，并将各岛命名勒石。这只是为防止当时外国野心家的窥伺，并不是说西沙群岛到这个时候才正式归入中国版图的。在此之前，1908年中国海关曾按各国的请求，呈请中国政府在群岛上建设灯塔，保证航行安全，但未实行。1930年，香港召开远东气象台会议，法国方面代表曾向中国建议在西沙群岛设立气象台。中间从1921年到1926年，虽然有日本商人曾来西沙开采经营，企图霸占，但在中国人民反对之下，终于撤退。日本政府在当时也没有敢故意怀疑中国对西沙群岛的主权。
    从1930年开始，法国先后强占了南沙群岛（当时称团沙群岛）中的九岛。南沙和西沙相距三百五十海里，但法国人自知无理，又想声东击西指鹿为马，就进一步把西沙，南沙混为一谈，竟于1932年1月向中国驻法使馆硬说西沙群岛曾经越南王阮福映派兵占领，应属越南。这个说法是极端荒谬的。阮福映不但没有一度占领西沙群岛的事实，也显然没有这个可能。法国无中生有的言论，显然是利用前此一个居留越南的法国天主教士达贝孚主教曲解越南史料的谬说作为根据的。达贝孚的“越南地理”（法文，并有英文译本，在1838年发表）发表了将及一百年，从来没有受过学者们的重视。只是到了1929年，法国为了西沙、南沙群岛的战略上的重要性，决意进行侵占时，才想到利用这个毫无价值的意见做根据，并且命令详查越南旧档，寻找一些和西沙群岛毫不相干的材料来进行曲解。法国的无理要求，在当时已经受到中国方面的严厉的驳斥。（“外交评论”1933年11月，71页）
    1933年法国提出了对于西沙群岛毫无理由的要求，但还没有像南越吴庭艳集团最近所宣传的那样实行武力的占据，吴庭艳集团的宣传几乎完全是颠倒事实的。如1929年西沙群岛完全在中国控制之下，吴庭艳集团所说的“已属于越南迪石省管辖”，只是蓄意侵占者自己拟好的蓝图而已。事实上，1930年4月13日，法国才开始强占南沙群岛中的南威岛，还没有侵占西沙群岛。当时中国驻巴黎大使馆曾经驳斥了法国对西沙群岛的要求，法国没有答复，而不是“中国没有向法国抗议”。法国的阴谋由于1939年日本侵占西沙群岛、并驱逐盘据南沙群岛的法国军队而失败。到了1945年日本投降，1946年12月到1947年1月，中国在各国的公认下，派遣海军正式接收了南中国海的各岛屿，并且在一些岛上派兵驻守。但法国外交部在1947年1月9日竟无理地声称“西沙群岛应归法国。”中国驻法大使馆在同月十七日正式声明“西沙群岛一向在中国主权之下，中国政府不承认法国对该群岛的主张”。但不久法国海军竟无理地强在西沙群岛的珊瑚岛（“拔陶儿岛”）登陆，和我国驻在永兴岛（“武德岛”）的海军对峙。同月二十一日，当时中国政府的外交部长约见法国驻华公使梅理蔼，郑重声明西沙群岛主权属于我国，并质问法国海军的行动究属于何种意义。梅理蔼答复说，“法海军在西沙群岛之行动，并非出于法国政府之指使。”（“中央日报”，1947年1月22日）。后来法国自知理屈，力求避免正面交涉，毫无理由地提出用国际仲裁的办法来解决这实际上并不存在的“纠纷”。这在当时已经被中国拒绝了。极其明显，法国这一系列的阴谋和行动都是毫无理由，而且是严重地侵犯中国主权的。
    毫无疑问，西沙群岛长期以来是中国的领土，这不仅有中国方面的图籍可以复按，而且也是各国学者研究和历史资料所记实的。中外书籍也一致记载着中国人民在这些岛屿上不断进行的活动。中国对西沙群岛的主权一直是各国所承认的，而且对法国来说，还有条约上的根据和义务。特别在第二次世界大战后，西沙群岛和南沙群岛一样都已经经过正当、完备的手续，正式地归还了中国。今天吴庭艳集团所提出的“主张”，老早已被证明是无稽之谈了。当然吴庭艳集团的背后还站有它的指使人，美国的一些战争贩子。他们居然也厚颜地发表了一些荒谬无比的主张。但他们应该知道，任何虚构的理由都不能掩盖这样明显的掠夺企图。中国为了保卫自己无可争辩的主权，决不能容忍这种侵略罪行。（附图片）
