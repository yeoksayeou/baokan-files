    The Xisha Islands are China's Territory
    Shao Xunzheng
    The Xisha Islands, like the Dongsha, Zhongsha, and Nansha Islands, are indisputably Chinese territory. The name "Qizhou Yang," which the Chinese people habitually use to refer to the Xisha Islands, has appeared continuously in Chinese historical and geographical records since at least the 13th century.
    Everyone knows that the "Qizhou Yang" in Chinese historical records is the Xisha Islands. The earliest definite record should be the Biography of Shi Bi in the History of the Yuan Dynasty (compiled in the Ming Dynasty, but based on Yuan Dynasty materials). The biography records that in 1292, Yuan General Shi Bi led troops to sail "past Qizhou Yang, Wanli Shitang, and through Champa" to attack Java. Chinese and foreign scholars have confirmed that Qizhou Yang refers to the Xisha Islands. Wang Dayuan's "Daoyi Zhil√ºe" of 1349 recorded a Chinese maritime proverb, the first two lines of which are "Above are Qizhou (should be 'Zhou'), below are Kunlun." This and Fei Xin's record in his "Xingcha Shenglan," which he wrote while following Zheng He on his voyages to the Western Seas in the 15th century, "It is commonly said: one fears Qizhou above, and Kunlun below; if the compass is lost and the rudder fails, people and ships will perish," clearly share a common origin. The "Qizhou" mentioned here is "Qizhou Yang." Fei Xin himself certainly went to Qizhou Yang, as it was a necessary stop on the maritime route at that time. The "Wubei Zhi," written by Mao Yuanyi in 1621, transcribed a map drawn by Zheng He at that time, which recorded the names "Qizhou" and "Wanli Shitang." Scholars believe that the various island groups in the South China Sea were incorporated into the Chinese territory during the Ming Dynasty. There were often Chinese people in the Xisha Islands during the Ming Dynasty. For example, a batch of Ming Dynasty copper coins, "Yongle Tongbao," found under a living coral reef there, has been verified by scholars as most likely belonging to Chinese fishermen residing on the islands at that time. Ming Dynasty navigators and coastal people were familiar with Qizhou Yang. For example, Huang Zhong's "Hai Yu" of 1536 (Baoyantang Secret Collection edition) said: "From the Nanting Gate of Dongguan, sail to the ocean to Wuzhu, Duzhu, Qizhou (three ocean names), use the compass to the Kun Wei needle to Wailuo, Kun Jia needle forty-five legs to Old Port of Champa," which very accurately stated the location of Qizhou Yang. The coastal people of the Qing Dynasty were no less familiar with Qizhou Yang and other island groups in the South China Sea than those of the Ming Dynasty. Chen Lunhong's "Hai Guo Wen Jian Lu," recorded around 1730, and Yang Bingnan's "Hai Lu," narrated by navigator Xie Qinggao in 1820, both contain more records of Qizhou Yang. The attached map of "Hai Guo Wen Jian Lu" clearly lists Qizhou Yang, "Wanli Changsha," and "Qianli Shitang," namely the Xisha Islands, Zhongsha Islands, and Nansha Islands, as coastal islands of China and includes them in Chinese territory.
    The "Complete Geographical Treatise of the Chinese Empire" (written by French Jesuit priest Henri Havret), originally in French in 1905 and translated into English in 1908, correctly equated "Qizhou Yang" with "Paracel Islands" (i.e., the Xisha Islands). Moreover, the names "Qizhou Yang," "Changsha," and "Shitang" had long been recorded on Chinese maps. In addition to the maps of Zheng He in the Ming Dynasty and Chen Lunhong in the Qing Dynasty mentioned above, there are also various maps drawn by Shi Yongtu, Fu Yu, and others in the Qing Dynasty, which are well-known to Chinese and foreign scholars, all proving that these islands have always been Chinese territory.
    By the 19th century, Western countries began to pay attention to the islands in the South China Sea. In 1808, a British warship first measured the Xisha Islands. After the First Opium War, British warships continuously investigated and measured the islands in the South China Sea from 1844 to 1867. In 1868, the British Admiralty first published the "China Sea Pilot." In 1883, Germany also conducted surveys and measurements of the islands in the South China Sea, including the Xisha and Nansha Islands. This survey attracted the attention of the Chinese government at that time. After the Guangdong authorities protested to the German side, Germany stopped the survey (see "Compilation of Cases on the Xisha and Dongsha Islands" compiled by the Guangdong Department of Industry). Although some people in Western countries privately measured these Chinese islands for reasons such as navigation safety, just like they privately measured China's long coastline many times, and although they arbitrarily gave these islands some Western names on the map for convenience, just like they gave Western names to many coastal bays and other islands in China, the fact that the sovereignty of these islands belonged to China was recognized by all countries. For example, Article 3 of the "Sino-French Border Convention" of 1887 stipulated the boundary line, stating that "islands in the sea to the east of this line belong to China, and Jiutoushan (Vietnamese name Geduo) and other small islands in the sea to the west of this line belong to Vietnam." The Xisha and Nansha Islands are all east of the boundary line, and according to the treaty, they naturally belong to China, not Vietnam. This treaty was public, and no country at that time or afterwards questioned or objected to this treaty. From this, it can be seen that China's sovereignty over these islands has never been a problem.
    In the early 20th century, the great powers were eyeing China's borders and territorial waters. From 1907, Chinese officials also paid special attention to the security of the islands in the South China Sea. Therefore, Li Zhun, the Admiral of the Guangdong Navy, led the warships "Fubo" and "Chenhang" to inspect the Xisha Islands under the order of Zhang Renjun, the Governor of Guangdong, and also held a grand ceremony, firing cannons and raising flags on Dong Island and Lin Island, and naming and inscribing the islands on stone. This was only to prevent the coveting of foreign ambitious people at that time, and it does not mean that the Xisha Islands were officially incorporated into Chinese territory at this time. Prior to this, in 1908, the Chinese Customs had requested the Chinese government to build lighthouses on the islands at the request of various countries to ensure navigation safety, but this was not implemented. In 1930, a Far East Meteorological Observatory conference was held in Hong Kong, and the French representative suggested to China that a meteorological station be established in the Xisha Islands. Although Japanese merchants came to Xisha to exploit and manage the islands from 1921 to 1926, attempting to seize them, they finally withdrew under the opposition of the Chinese people. The Japanese government at that time did not dare to deliberately question China's sovereignty over the Xisha Islands.
    From 1930, France successively occupied nine islands in the Nansha Islands (then called the Tuan Sha Islands). Nansha and Xisha are 350 nautical miles apart, but the French knew they were unreasonable and wanted to confuse the issue by deliberately misrepresenting the facts, and further confused Xisha and Nansha, and even told the Chinese Embassy in France in January 1932 that the Xisha Islands had been occupied by troops sent by Vietnamese King Nguyen Phuc Anh and should belong to Vietnam. This statement is extremely absurd. Not only did Nguyen Phuc Anh not occupy the Xisha Islands, but it was also clearly impossible for him to do so. France's fabricated remarks were obviously based on the fallacy of a French Catholic priest, Bishop D'Espagnac, residing in Vietnam, who misinterpreted Vietnamese historical materials. D'Espagnac's "Geography of Vietnam" (in French, with an English translation, published in 1838) had been published for nearly a hundred years and had never been valued by scholars. It was only in 1929, when France decided to invade and occupy the Xisha and Nansha Islands due to their strategic importance, that they thought of using this worthless opinion as a basis and ordered a detailed investigation of old Vietnamese archives to find some materials that were irrelevant to the Xisha Islands for misinterpretation. France's unreasonable demands were severely refuted by the Chinese side at that time. ("Diplomatic Review," November 1933, p. 71)
    In 1933, France made an unreasonable demand for the Xisha Islands, but did not carry out a military occupation as promoted by the South Vietnamese Ngo Dinh Diem group recently. The propaganda of the Ngo Dinh Diem group is almost completely reversing the facts. For example, in 1929, the Xisha Islands were completely under Chinese control. The "under the jurisdiction of the Rach Gia Province of Vietnam" mentioned by the Ngo Dinh Diem group is just a blueprint prepared by the deliberate invaders themselves. In fact, on April 13, 1930, France only began to forcibly occupy Nanwei Island in the Nansha Islands and had not yet invaded the Xisha Islands. At that time, the Chinese Embassy in Paris refuted France's demands for the Xisha Islands, and France did not reply, rather than "China did not protest to France." France's conspiracy failed because Japan invaded the Xisha Islands in 1939 and drove out the French troops occupying the Nansha Islands. When Japan surrendered in 1945, from December 1946 to January 1947, with the recognition of various countries, China dispatched the navy to officially take over the islands in the South China Sea and stationed troops on some islands. However, the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs unreasonably claimed on January 9, 1947, that "the Xisha Islands should belong to France." The Chinese Embassy in France officially stated on the 17th of the same month that "the Xisha Islands have always been under Chinese sovereignty, and the Chinese government does not recognize France's claim to the islands." However, soon the French navy unreasonably landed on Coral Island ("Pattle Island") in the Xisha Islands, confronting our navy stationed on Yongxing Island ("Woody Island"). On the 21st of the same month, the then Chinese Foreign Minister met with French Minister to China, M√©rillon, and solemnly stated that the sovereignty of the Xisha Islands belonged to China and questioned the meaning of the French navy's actions. M√©rillon replied that "the actions of the French navy in the Xisha Islands were not instructed by the French government." ("Central Daily News," January 22, 1947). Later, France, knowing that it was unjustified, tried to avoid direct negotiations and unreasonably proposed to resolve this non-existent "dispute" through international arbitration. This was rejected by China at that time. It is extremely obvious that this series of conspiracies and actions by France were unreasonable and seriously infringed on China's sovereignty.
    There is no doubt that the Xisha Islands have long been Chinese territory. This can be verified not only by Chinese maps and records, but also by the research of scholars from various countries and historical records. Chinese and foreign books also unanimously record the continuous activities of the Chinese people on these islands. China's sovereignty over the Xisha Islands has always been recognized by all countries, and for France, there are also treaty-based grounds and obligations. Especially after World War II, the Xisha Islands, like the Nansha Islands, had already been formally returned to China through legitimate and complete procedures. The "claims" put forward by the Ngo Dinh Diem group today have long been proven to be nonsense. Of course, behind the Ngo Dinh Diem group stands its instigator, some warmongers in the United States. They also shamelessly published some absurd claims. But they should know that no fabricated reason can cover up such an obvious attempt at plunder. China will never tolerate this act of aggression in order to defend its indisputable sovereignty. (Attached picture)
