Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, July 22nd: Gansu Province will comprehensively carry out soil and water conservation work and improve the quality of farmland water conservancy in the second half of this year. This decision was made at the Second Provincial Conference on Water Conservancy and Soil Conservation jointly convened by the Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry's Water Conservancy Bureau and Soil and Water Conservation Bureau from the 9th to the 20th.

The conference first conducted a comprehensive inspection and critical analysis of the water conservancy and soil conservation work in Gansu Province in the first half of this year. According to the results of the inspection, after fully utilizing the various water conservancy projects built throughout the province from March to the end of June, the irrigated area can be expanded by more than 6.31 million mu, exceeding this year's planned target by 26%; various field projects, flood diversion, gully damming, and pasture planting throughout the province can basically control soil erosion over an area of 14,000 square kilometers, equivalent to twice the total area of soil erosion controlled in the years since liberation. However, there is a common and serious neglect of quality in water conservancy and soil conservation work in various places. In terms of water conservancy construction, due to the pursuit of quantity, nearly one million mu of completed water conservancy projects are waste products or semi-finished products. Among the more than 240,000 new wells dug throughout the province, it is estimated that waste products account for about 15%, and semi-finished products account for 40% to 50%. In terms of soil and water conservation, many places have not properly implemented the principle of "overall planning and comprehensive management," resulting in a one-sided emphasis on building earth dams in gullies, neglecting the methods of controlling soil erosion such as "field first, then gully" and "from top to bottom, combining above and below," as well as other supporting measures. Some places blindly built earth dams without measurement or design, resulting in the earth dams being washed away by heavy rain. It is estimated that among the more than 36,000 earth dams completed, the proportion of those of poor quality or washed away reaches more than 25%.

In response to the above situations and problems, the meeting held that in water conservancy construction in the second half of this year, it is necessary to consolidate achievements, improve quality, and combine development to ensure that newly completed irrigation projects can achieve benefits as much as possible; soil and water conservation must also be carried out comprehensively according to local conditions, especially vigorously developing field projects and correcting the bias of only focusing on gully damming or giving equal importance to gullies and slopes.

### 甘肃省第二次水利和水土保持会议决定  下半年起全面开展水土保持工作

    甘肃省第二次水利和水土保持会议决定
    下半年起全面开展水土保持工作
    新华社兰州22日电　甘肃省今年下半年将全面开展水土保持工作和提高农田水利的质量。这是九日到二十日省农林厅水利局和水土保持局联合召开的全省第二次水利和水土保持会议作出的决定。
    这次会议首先对甘肃省今年上半年的水利和水土保持工作作了全面检查和分析批判。根据检查的结果，从今年三月到六月底，全省兴修的各种水利工程全部加以利用后，共计可以扩大灌溉面积六百三十一万多亩，超过今年计划任务26％；全省兴修的各种田间工程、引洪漫地、沟壑筑坝和种植的牧草等，共计可以基本上控制水土流失面积一万四千平方公里，相当于解放后几年来控制水土流失面积总和的两倍。但是，各地在开展水利和水土保持中有普遍而较严重的忽视质量的情况。在兴修水利方面，由于追求数量，在完成的水利工程中有将近一百万亩是废品或半废品。全省新打的二十四万多眼井中，估计废品占15％左右，半成品占40％到50％。在水土保持方面，许多地方没有很好贯彻“全面规划，综合治理”的方针，以致片面重视在沟壑中筑土坝，忽视了“先田间，后沟壑”和“从上到下，上下结合”等控制水土流失的治理方法，以及其他方面的配合措施。有些地方没有经过测量、设计，盲目乱打土坝，结果土坝被大雨冲垮。据估计，完成的三万六千多个土坝，质量不好和被冲垮的达到25％以上。
    针对以上情况和问题，会议认为今年下半年兴修水利，必须巩固成绩，提高质量，结合发展，尽可能使新完成的灌溉工程都能收到效益；水土保持也必须因地制宜，全面开展，特别是大力开展田间工程，纠正那种只重视沟壑筑坝或沟面并重的偏向。
