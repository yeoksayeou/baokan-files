Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, 22nd. A person in charge of the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant told Xinhua reporters today that, for more than two years, workers from over sixty factories in Shanghai, Hangzhou, Wuxi, and other places have rushed to manufacture more than 30,000 sets (pieces) of mechanical and electrical equipment for the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant. This year, with the rapid progress of the construction project, the equipment supply work is also very tense. In the first half of this year alone, various cooperating factories accepted urgent orders for 4,000 sets (pieces) of mechanical and electrical equipment, including various automatic control instruments and switches, automatic adjustment and temperature recording instruments, various machine tools, electric furnaces, test benches, etc. Some products are being manufactured domestically for the first time. Not long ago, workers at the Shanghai Machine Tool Electrical Appliance Factory spent only three days to complete an emergency task of 16 micro switches for the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant. More than ten factories affiliated with Shanghai Instrument Manufacturing Company and Electric Power Equipment Manufacturing Company have also given priority to trial-producing dozens of automatic control instruments and switches for the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant.

    两年来供应机器装备三万多件
    新华社长春22日电　第一汽车制造厂负责人今天对新华社记者说，两年多来，上海、杭州、无锡等地六十多个工厂的职工为第一汽车厂赶制出三万多台（件）的机械电器设备。今年，随着建厂工程的迅速进展，设备供应工作也很紧张。单是今年上半年，各协作厂就接受了四千台（件）机械电器设备的紧急订货，其中有各种自动控制仪表及开关、自动调整和记录温度的仪器、各种机床、电炉、试验台等。有些产品是国内第一次制造的。不久以前，上海机床电器厂的工人仅花了三天时间，就为第一汽车厂突击完成了十六个微动开关的紧急任务。上海仪表制造公司和电力设备制造公司所属的十多家工厂，也曾经优先为第一汽车厂试制了几十种自动控制仪表和开关。
