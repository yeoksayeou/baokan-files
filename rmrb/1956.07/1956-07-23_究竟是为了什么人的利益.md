In Whose Interest, After All?
Xu Ba

The brutal suppression of the Algerian national independence movement by France has aroused condemnation from world public opinion, especially from the people of Asian and African countries. The heads of state of South, India, and Egypt issued a joint statement a few days ago condemning the colonial rule maintained in Algeria. Within France itself, there are also a growing number of people who oppose the Algerian War because it harms the interests of the French nation. However, the French government is still continuing to increase its troops and is plotting so-called new strategies to suppress the so-called "rebellion." In whose interest is the French government doing this? In a word, it is for the narrow interests of the French colonialist group.

French colonists invaded Algeria in 1830 and later turned it into a base for expansion into Africa. Colonial plunder brought huge benefits to the French colonists, but seriously hindered the economic development of Algeria, leaving it in a backward state for a long time and making it economically dependent on France.

The agricultural population of Algeria accounts for about 80% of the total population. However, most of them do not have and lack land. Most of the arable land has been seized by French colonists. After the French colonists invaded Algeria, they plundered land on a large scale. The famous French colonist Bugeaud said in 1840: "As long as there is good and fertile land there, colonists must be settled there, regardless of who owns the land." Therefore, the area of land occupied by French colonists continued to expand. At present, only 13,000 French colonists occupy 55% of the arable land, and it is all the most fertile land. The land owned by local farmers is getting less and less. At present, there are as many as 1.15 million landless farmers, including tenant farmers, long-term workers, seasonal workers, or agricultural workers paid by the day. They are subjected to the ruthless exploitation of French colonial landlords and capitalists.

French colonists monopolized agricultural production in Algeria. According to statistics, 6,000 French colonists harvested half of all agricultural products. The agriculture operated by French colonists only cares about making profits for themselves, and does not produce food or other things needed by local residents, but only produces items such as grapes (local Muslim residents do not drink alcohol; growing grapes is to supply raw materials for French winemakers) as well as fruits and vegetables needed by France. 90% of these products are harvested by them and exported to France. Grape production in Algeria accounts for more than one-third of the total value of agricultural production. This alone shows the colonial nature of Algeria's agricultural economy. The products harvested by French colonists receive a protected price that is a quarter to a third higher than normal, while only paying local agricultural workers extremely low wages. In this way, French colonists became wealthy.

Industry in Algeria is very underdeveloped, with mining and tobacco manufacturing being the larger industries. These industries are also almost entirely monopolized by French colonists. The tobacco industry is monopolized by one company. The mining industry is monopolized by several companies. For example, the "Ouenza Iron Ore Company" monopolized 80% of iron ore production, the "Constantine Phosphate Company" monopolized 80% of phosphate production, three large companies monopolized 75% of lead production, and two large companies monopolized 80% of zinc sulfide ore and zinc carbonate production. The situation in other mining industries is roughly the same. In fact, the monopoly power is concentrated in the hands of a smaller number of financial groups, such as the "Union Bank of Paris-Mirabeau," the "Rothschild Group," and the "Mining Committee," because they control the above-mentioned large companies and some other small companies. French monopoly capitalists carried out cruel exploitation of local workers. Often, a worker earns only 80 francs per hour, but the company gets more than 1,000 francs in profit. French monopoly capitalists obtained staggering amounts of profit from Algeria. For example, the profit earned by 24 large companies in 1947 was 460 million francs, which increased to 6.58 billion francs by 1953, an increase of more than ten times in just a few years.

In terms of foreign trade, its colonial nature is even more obvious. French colonists actually monopolized all imports and exports and transportation in Algeria, so other countries cannot trade directly with Algeria. French shipping monopoly companies took advantage of this situation to raise freight rates to one to three times higher than usual. At the same time, the prices of goods imported into Algeria are also increased to protect the market. It is estimated that out of the 172 billion francs in 1954, the increased price reached 32 billion francs (not including very high freight rates). However, the total wealth of the Algerian people is only 400 billion francs. Unequal trade caused Algeria to suffer huge losses in imports and exports. In 1955, the import surplus reached 69.3 billion francs. Algeria mainly exports minerals and agricultural raw materials and food to France, and the vast majority of goods imported into it are consumer goods. This kind of import and export has damaged Algeria's economy.

Due to the French colonists' heavy plunder and exploitation, the lives of the Algerian people are extremely impoverished.

The population of Algeria is less than 10 million, but the unemployed and semi-employed population reaches 1.5 million to 2 million. Even those who have jobs do not earn enough for their minimum living needs. The cost of living in Algeria is almost as high as in France, but the average monthly income of Muslim residents in Algeria is only more than 1,300 francs, while in France, the average monthly income per person is more than 13,000 francs, a difference of ten times. Leryp, the general secretary of the French General Confederation of Labor, discovered during his investigation in Algeria this year that almost everyone, regardless of whether they are men, women, or children, has never been full, and among the workers' representatives he met, no one under the age of fifty had ever bought a new pair of pants or a new jacket. Living conditions are overcrowded, and there is a severe lack of sanitation and medical facilities. As a result, infectious diseases are prevalent, and there are about 400,000 people suffering from lung diseases. The infant mortality rate is as high as 18%.

From the above situation, it can be seen that the policy currently implemented by the French government of not recognizing the national rights of the Algerian people and adopting military suppression of the Algerian people's desire for independence is only for the narrow interests of the French colonialist group. Some people in France say that Algeria is an indispensable part of the French economy, but this is not based on facts. Exports to Algeria only account for about 1% of France's total production. (Moreover, normal trade relations will not be interrupted because the national rights of the Algerian people are recognized.) In fact, the French treasury still has to spend a large amount of maintenance expenses for Algeria every year. This expense becomes a burden on the French people and does not benefit the Algerian people in any way. It only indirectly flows into the pockets of North African colonialists. Some people also portray the interests of colonialism as the normal interests of Europeans in Algeria, which is nothing more than an attempt to cover up this fact and incite hatred between Arabs and European residents in order to continue to use force to maintain the interests of the French colonialist group.

    究竟是为了什么人的利益
    徐拔
    法国对于阿尔及利亚民族独立运动的野蛮镇压已经引起了世界公众舆论，特别是亚非国家人民的谴责。南、印、埃三国政府首脑在几天前发表的联合声明中就谴责了在阿尔及利亚维持的殖民统治。在法国国内也有越来越多的人反对阿尔及利亚战争，因为它损害法国民族的利益。但是迄今法国政府还在继续增兵，并策划所谓新战略，要把所谓“叛乱”镇压下去。法国政府这样作究竟是为了什么人的利益呢？一句话就是为了法国殖民主义集团的狭隘利益。
    法国殖民者是在1830年侵入阿尔及利亚的，后来把它变成了向非洲扩张的基地。殖民掠夺使法国殖民者获得了巨大利益，却严重地阻碍了阿尔及利亚经济的发展，使它长期处于落后状态，成为法国经济上的附属体。
    阿尔及利亚农业人口约占总人口的80％。但他们大部分没有和缺少土地。大部分耕地都被法国殖民者霸占了。法国殖民者侵入阿尔及利亚以后，就大规模地掠夺土地。著名的法国殖民者蒲育在1840年说过：“只要那里有好的土地和肥沃的土地，那里就必须安插殖民者，而不必过问这些土地是属于谁的。”因此法国殖民者占据的土地面积不断扩大。在目前，只是一万三千个法国殖民者就占有了55％的可耕地，而且都是最肥沃的土地。当地农民的土地却越来越少。目前无地的农民包括佃农、长工、季工或按日计酬的农业工人在内共有一百一十五万人之多。他们受着法国殖民地主资本家的无情压榨。
    法国殖民者垄断了阿尔及利亚的农业生产。据统计，六千个法国殖民者就收获了全部农产品的一半。法国殖民者经营的农业只顾为他们自己牟利，并不生产粮食之类为当地居民需要的东西，而只生产像葡萄（当地回教居民不喝酒。种植葡萄是为法国酿酒商供应原料）以及水果和蔬菜等供法国需要的物品。这些产品的90％由他们收获并向法国输出。阿尔及利亚的葡萄生产占农业生产总值的三分之一以上。即此一点就可以看出阿尔及利亚农业经济的殖民地性质。法国殖民者收获的这些产品得到比平常贵四分之一到三分之一的保护价格，而只给当地的农业工人付出极低廉的工资。这样法国殖民者就发福了。
    阿尔及利亚工业是很不发达的，较大的只有采矿和制烟工业。这些工业也几乎全部为法国殖民者所垄断。制烟工业由一家公司垄断。采矿业则由几家公司垄断了。比如“乌翁沙铁矿公司”垄断了铁矿砂生产的80％，“君士坦丁磷酸盐公司”垄断了亚磷酸盐生产的80％，三个大公司垄断了铅生产的75％，两个大公司垄断了硫化锌矿砂和碳酸锌生产的80％。其他采矿工业方面的情形也大体一样。实际上，垄断权是集中在为数更少的几个金融集团，像“巴黎—米拉波联合银行”、“洛希尔集团”和“矿业委员会”等手里的，因为它们控制了上述的大公司以及另外一些小公司。法国垄断资本家对当地工人进行了残酷的剥削。往往一个工人工作一小时所得工资仅八十个法郎，但是公司却得到一千多个法郎的利润。法国垄断资本家从阿尔及利亚获得了惊人巨额的利润，比如二十四家大公司1947年获得的利润是四亿六千万法郎，到1953年增加到了六十五亿八千万法郎，几年之间就增加了十几倍。
    在对外贸易方面，其殖民地性质更为显著，法国殖民者实际上垄断了阿尔及利亚的所有出入口和运输，因此别国无法和阿尔及利亚直接通商，法国船舶垄断公司利用这种情况，把运费提高到比通常贵一倍到三倍。同时向阿尔及利亚输入的货物还要因为保护市场而提高价格。据估计，在1954年的一千七百二十亿法郎中，提高的价格达三百二十亿法郎。（不包括很高的运费。）但是阿尔及利亚人民的全部财富才四千亿法郎。不等价的贸易使阿尔及利亚在输出入方面遭受巨大损失，1955年入超达六百九十三亿法郎。阿尔及利亚输往法国的主要是矿物和农业原料和食物，向它输入的货物极大部分是消费品，这种输出入使得阿尔及利亚的经济遭到破坏。
    由于法国殖民者的这重重掠夺和剥削，阿尔及利亚人民的生活极度贫困。
    阿尔及利亚的人口不到一千万，但是失业和半失业的人口竟达一百五十万到二百万人。即使有工作的人，收入也远不够最低生活所需。阿尔及利亚的生活费用差不多和法国一样高，但是阿尔及利亚的回教居民平均每人每月收入只一千三百多法郎，在法国，平均每人每月收入一万三千多法郎，相差十倍。法国总工会总书记勒里普今年在阿尔及利亚调查时发现：几乎所有的人不论是男女小孩都从来没有吃饱过，而在和他会见的工人代表中，没有一个五十岁以内的人买过一条新裤子或新上装。住的地方拥挤不堪，卫生和医疗设施非常缺乏：因而传染病流行，肺病患者约有四十多万人。儿童死亡率高达18％。
    从以上的情况可以看到，法国政府现在执行的不承认阿尔及利亚人民的民族权利、对阿尔及利亚人民的独立愿望采取武力镇压的政策，只是为了法国殖民主义集团的狭隘利益。法国有人说，阿尔及利亚是法国经济不可缺少的一部分，这是没有事实根据的。对阿尔及利亚的出口只占法国生产总值的百分之一左右。（而且，正常的贸易联系是并不会因为承认了阿尔及利亚人民的民族权利而中断的。）事实上，法国国库每年还须为阿尔及利亚支出一大笔维持费用，这笔费用成为法国人民肩上的负担，而对阿尔及利亚人民并无什么好处，它只是间接地流进了北非殖民主义者的荷包。还有些人把殖民主义的利益说成是在阿尔及利亚的欧洲人的正常利益，也不过是企图掩盖这个事实，并煽起阿拉伯人和欧洲籍侨民之间的仇恨，以便继续用武力来维护法国殖民主义集团的利益。
