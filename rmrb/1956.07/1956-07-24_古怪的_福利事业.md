    A Strange "Welfare Undertaking"
    There is a strange phenomenon at the Damaoshan Sub-bureau of the Guangxi Forestry Industry Bureau: all staff members take tonics every morning, things like cod liver oil, blood tonics, brain tonics, really all shapes and sizes.
    Why do all staff members need to take tonics? Have they all become weak? No, it turns out the bureau has accumulated a large sum of welfare funds, and in order to use this money for "collective welfare undertakings," they adopted a "going to the mountains to shoot birds, everyone gets a share" approach, dividing all employees into three grades for universal subsidies. The first grade, for those who work well but are in poor health, or who work well and are also in good health, gets nine yuan; the second grade, for those who work generally and are in poor health, or who work generally and are also in good health, gets seven yuan; the third grade, for those who work poorly and are in poor health, or who work poorly but are in good health, gets five yuan, totaling more than 1,800 yuan in subsidies. The office made unified purchases and distributed them according to grade, so the spectacle of "everyone receives a subsidy, everyone takes tonics" appeared. Some people, although strong and healthy, felt ashamed to accept the subsidy, but since it was a unified regulation, they couldn't refuse the kindness, so they had to accept and take the medicine.
    Anyone sensible who reads this news will laugh, which proves that the kind of "collective welfare undertaking" carried out by the Damaoshan Sub-bureau of the Guangxi Forestry Industry Bureau is indeed quite ridiculous. We really want to ask the leaders of this bureau, have you considered the difference between collectivism and egalitarianism? Have you thought about the big difference between rewarding and subsidizing staff? Do you know that the scope of welfare undertakings is not limited to things like cod liver oil, brain tonics, and blood tonics? If you haven't thought about it, it's time to use your brains.

    古怪的“福利事业”
    广西森林工业局大苗山支局有种奇怪的现象，所有工作人员每天早晨都吃补药，什么鱼肝油、补血丸、补脑丸，真是形形色色，不一而足。
    为什么所有的工作人员都要吃补药，是不是都得了虚弱症？不是，原来该局积下了一大笔福利金，为了把这笔钱用于“集体福利事业，”就采取“上山打鸟，人人有份”的办法，把全体职工分为三等，进行普遍补助。第一等是工作好身体坏的，或者工作好身体也好的得九元，第二等是工作一般身体坏的，或者工作一般身体好的得七元；第三等是工作坏身体也坏的，或者工作坏身体却好的得五元，一共补助了一千八百多元。由机关统一购买，按等分配，于是“个个受补助，人人吃补药”的奇观便出现了。有的人虽然身强体壮，有愧于接受补助，但既是统一规定也就盛情难却，只好照领照服了。
    只要是懂事的人看了这新闻，一定会发笑，这就证明了广西森林工业局大苗山支局举办的这种“集体福利事业”确实是相当可笑的。我们真想问问这个局的领导人员，你们是否考虑过集体主义和平均主义的区别？是否想到过对工作人员的奖励和对工作人员的补助大有区别？是否知道福利事业的范围并不限于鱼肝油、补脑丸、补血丸之类？如果没有想过，是该动动脑筋了。
