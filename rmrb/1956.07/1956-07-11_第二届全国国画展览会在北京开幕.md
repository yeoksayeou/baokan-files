Xinhua News Agency, July 10th: The Second National Exhibition of Chinese Painting opened today at the exhibition hall of the Chinese Artists Association in Beijing.

    Old painters Qi Baishi, He Xiangning, Yu Feian, Chen Banding, Wu Hufan, He Tianjian, and others have works participating in this exhibition. The artistic conception of painter Wang Ge Yis's "Chrysanthemums in a Vase" and seventy-nine-year-old painter Yao Shiqian's "Hollyhocks" gives a refreshing feeling. Although there is not a single stroke of water on the picture of painter Wang Qingfang's "Goldfish", it expresses the vivid posture of goldfish swimming in the water.

    The young painter Liu Danzhai's "The Yellow River Clears on a Sunny Day," with Chairman Mao Zedong's inspection of the Yellow River as the subject matter, successfully expresses this scene. Painter Li Xiongcai's hand scroll "Flood Control in Wuhan" is as long as 26.6 meters, fully expressing the scene of the people of Wuhan working together to engage in the flood control movement. Huang Zhou's "Playing Polo" depicts sports activities in the troops with unrestrained brushstrokes. Fang Zengxian's "Every Grain is Hard-Earned," Huang Zixi's "Joining the Cooperative," Zhou Changgus's "On the Way Home," Du Chonghua's "Going to Market," and other works are all taken from rural life.

    The exhibition is held by the Ministry of Culture and the Chinese Artists Association in order to further develop the national traditional painting art and encourage Chinese painting creation.

    第二届全国国画展览会在北京开幕
    据新华社10日讯　第二届全国国画展览会今天在北京中国美术家协会展览馆开幕。
    老画家齐白石、何香凝、于非暗、陈半丁、吴湖帆、贺天健等人都有作品参加这次展出。画家王个簃的“瓶菊”和七十九岁老画家姚石倩的“蜀葵”的意境，给人清新的感觉。画家王青芳的“金鱼”虽然画面上没有一笔水纹，却表现出了金鱼在水中游动的生动姿态。
    青年画家刘旦宅的“河清有日”，以毛泽东主席视察黄河为题材，成功地表现了这一情景。画家黎雄才的手卷“武汉防汛图”长达二十六点六公尺，充分表现了武汉人民同心协力投入防汛运动的场面。黄胄的“打马球”，以奔放的笔法描写了部队中的体育活动。方增先的“粒粒皆辛苦”、黄子曦的“入社”、周昌谷的“回家路上”、杜重划的“上市去”等作品，都取材于农村生活。
    展览会是文化部和中国美术家协会为了进一步发扬民族传统绘画艺术、鼓励国画创作而举办的。
