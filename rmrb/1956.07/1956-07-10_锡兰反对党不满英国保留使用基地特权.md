Xinhua News Agency, Colombo, 8th: Some opposition parties in Ceylon have expressed dissatisfaction with Britain's conditional handover of its military bases in Ceylon. According to a British government statement issued on July 6th, Britain will continue to enjoy certain "facilities" in Ceylon after the military bases are handed over.

    Ceylon Communist Party leader, Keuneman, said on July 7th that he did not consider this a cancellation of British bases, but rather Ceylon managing these bases for Britain.

    Ceylon's Lanka Sama Samaja Party representative, N.M. Perera, also said: "Since Britain has the right to use these bases for its purposes, and Ceylon is a weak country in relation to the British Empire, the actual situation is that Ceylon is managing its bases for Britain's purposes." He pointed out that Britain handing over the bases in this way would place a greater financial burden on Ceylon.

    De Silva also said: "What's worse is that previously Britain only had uncertain and unstable rights to use the bases, but now it has obtained the legal right to use these bases under a clearly stipulated agreement."

    锡兰反对党不满英国保留使用基地特权
    据新华社8日讯　科伦坡消息：锡兰的一些反对党派对英国有保留地移交它在锡兰的军事基地表示不满。根据英国政府七月六日发表的公报，英国在移交军事基地之后仍将在锡兰享有某些“便利”。
    锡兰共产党领袖克尼曼七月七日说：他认为这不是撤消英国基地，而是由锡兰为英国经管这些基地。
    锡兰新平等社会党的代表德西尔瓦也说：“由于英国有权为它的目的而使用这些基地，而锡兰对英帝国来说是一个弱小国家，因此，实际情况是锡兰为英国的目的而经管它的基地。”他指出，英国这样移交基地将使锡兰在财政上承受一个更大的负担。
    德西尔克还说：“更糟的是，在此以前英国对基地的使用只有不肯定和不稳定的权利，现在它根据明文规定的协定却获得使用这些基地的合法权利了。”
