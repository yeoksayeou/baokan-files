    Sino-Soviet Trade Continues to Expand
    Zheng Tuobin
    On July 25th, the governments of China and the Soviet Union signed a supplementary exchange of goods protocol in Beijing, determining that in addition to the goods stipulated in the Sino-Soviet 1956 exchange of goods protocol signed on December 27, 1955, the two countries would further increase the supply of certain goods to each other. Thus, Sino-Soviet trade will have further growth in 1956. Currently, China is in a high tide of socialist construction. All departments are working hard to exceed and complete the first Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule. With the acceleration of socialist construction, the materials needed for construction have also greatly increased. The way to solve the problem of equipment and material supply is to tap domestic potential on the one hand, and increase imports on the other. Based on this situation, the Chinese government conducted negotiations with the Soviet government on mutually supplementing the supply of goods.
    This year, the quantity of supplementary orders that China has proposed to the Soviet Union is very large, unprecedented in previous years. Originally, in the Sino-Soviet 1956 exchange of goods protocol signed on December 27, 1955, the Soviet Union had already made its greatest efforts, and the supply of many important materials necessary for China's construction, such as drilling rigs and thick steel plates, had greatly increased compared to the past. Now, to further supplement the supply of many equipment and materials to China is, of course, very difficult for the Soviet Union, which practices planned production. However, in this supplementary supply of goods negotiation, the Soviet side tried all kinds of methods and still agreed to supply China with a large number of materials. The steel rails supplied under this supplementary protocol are almost enough to lay half of the Yingxia Railway, and the drilling rigs supplied are equal to 3.3 times the total supply for the entire year of 1955. The supplementary supply of goods also includes various construction machinery, precision instruments, as well as steel and various equipment, etc. In addition, for goods that take time to manufacture and cannot be supplied this year, the Soviet Union also agreed to pre-sign contracts for next year, and try to supply China in the first quarter or first half of next year. These materials are of great significance to the Chinese people in exceeding and completing the first Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule. This is another clear manifestation of Sino-Soviet friendly relations.
    This time, the Soviet Union also accepted a large batch of industrial raw materials, rice, food, woolen fabrics, knitwear, and handicrafts from us, greatly increasing the sales of these traditional export commodities in China, which can further promote the production of China's industry (especially light industry), agriculture, and handicrafts, and provide a large amount of foreign exchange for the import of materials needed for China's industrialization.
    The Soviet Union also took special care of our difficulties in accepting China's export goods. For example, pork is a commodity that the Soviet Union needs very much, and it was originally planned to accept 30,000 tons of pork in the supplementary export list we proposed. However, it was later discovered that China's pork supply was not sufficient, and the Chinese government decided to reduce pork exports. After explaining this situation to the Soviet Union, the Soviet Union quickly understood our difficulties and cancelled all 30,000 tons of pork on the supplementary list, and instead accepted other goods from China that we had a surplus of for our own use.
    This close relationship of Sino-Soviet economic cooperation is unprecedented. We should thank the Soviet government and people for their help to China and should learn from this example. But we should work harder to produce and increase the supply of export goods, and under possible conditions, meet the needs of the Soviet people. This is also a responsibility we should fulfill in Sino-Soviet economic cooperation.

    中苏贸易继续扩大
    郑拓彬
    七月二十五日，我国政府和苏联政府在北京签订了一个补充换货议定书，确定除了1955年12月27日签订的中苏1956年换货议定书规定的货物外，两国间再互相增加供应一些货物。这样，1956年中苏贸易又将有进一步的增长。目前，我国正处在社会主义建设的高潮中。各部门都为超额和提前完成第一个五年计划而努力。随着社会主义建设的加快，建设所需要的物资也大大地增加了。解决设备和材料供应问题的办法，一方面靠发掘国内的潜力，另一方面也必须增加进口。根据这种情况，我国政府同苏联政府进行了互相补充供应货物的谈判。
    今年，我国向苏联提出的补充订货的数量很大，是历年所没有的。本来，在1955年12月27日签订的中苏1956年换货议定书中，苏联就曾尽了最大的努力，对于许多我国建设上必需的重要物资，如钻探机、厚钢板等，比已往供应的数量有了很大的增加，现在再要补充供应我国许多设备和器材，对于实行计划生产的苏联来说，当然是很困难的。但是，在这次补充供应货物谈判中，苏联方面想尽各种办法，还是同意以大批物资供应我国。这次补充议定书规定供应的钢轨，差不多就可铺设半条鹰厦铁路，供应的钻探机，等于1955年全年供应总数的三点三倍。补充供应的货物中，还有各种土建机械、精密仪器，以及钢材和各种设备等等。此外，对于制造费时不能在今年供应的货物，苏联还同意预签明年的合同，设法在明年第一季或上半年供应我国。这些物资，对于我国人民超额和提前完成第一个五年计划有着很大的意义。这是中苏友好关系的又一个鲜明的表现。
    这次，苏联也接受了我们很大一批工业原料、大米、食品、呢绒、针织品和手工艺品，大大地增加了我国这些传统出口商品的销路，从而可以进一步促进我国工业（特别是轻工业）、农业和手工业的生产，为我国工业化所需物资的进口提供大量的外汇。
    苏联在接受我国的出口货物方面，还特别照顾了我们的困难。例如：猪肉是苏联很需要的货物，原计划在我们提出的补充出口货单中接受猪肉三万吨。但后来发现我国猪肉货源不够充足，我国政府决定减少猪肉出口。在向苏联说明这个情况后，苏联很快谅解了我们的困难，把补充货单上的三万吨猪肉全部撤销了，而另外接受了我国自用有余的其他货物。
    中苏经济合作的这种密切关系是史无前例的，苏联政府和人民对我国的帮助是我们应当感谢的，应当学习这种榜样。但是我们更应当努力生产，增加出口货源，在尽可能的条件下，满足苏联人民的需要，这也是我们在中苏经济合作中应尽的责任。
