Comedy uses laughter as a weapon to achieve its educational purpose. The Xiang opera "Sacrificing the Headscarf" demonstrates this power. The story of "Sacrificing the Headscarf" is as follows: Shi Hao, eighty-two years old, has failed eight imperial examinations. This year, he went to the capital to take the examination again. Before the results were announced, he was anxious; so he took off his headscarf and wrote an essay to mourn it. Suddenly, good news came, and the old man was overjoyed and fainted. The plot is that simple, but the characters are incisively portrayed.

This play is sung in Gaoqiang style, with six songs in total. The protagonist Shi Hao was originally played by a clown. Qiu Jicai, a famous old artist of Xiang opera, in order to create this character, visited the old gentlemen who had taken the imperial examinations, observed their demeanor, and through his own specific experience, created a vivid image of an old scholar who had failed eight times but was unwilling to give up. In opera performance techniques, there is a generalization of the character image of reactionary intellectuals called "Fangjin Chou" (square-scarved clown), but Qiu Jicai's performance of Shi Hao does not rigidly apply the "Fangjin Chou" stereotype. Instead, he creatively used various clown and "Fangjin Chou" performance techniques, starting from the creation of this special image of Shi Hao. Therefore, in his performance, we cannot see a pre-made mold copied from the clown character. As soon as Shi Hao appears, he makes people see that this old Confucian scholar, although old and frail, is still extraordinarily arrogant, a frustrated man full of grievances. He wears a black scarf and a red robe, his beard and hair are white, his back is hunched, and his face is haggard; but he deliberately appears energetic, putting on a look of not accepting old age, as if a withered tree is trying to bloom. After appearing on stage, he sings: "The three exams are over, a smiling face opens, the more I think, the happier I become. My thoughts surge, my writing is quite fast, I will definitely pass this time, there will be an official hat to wear!" When Qiu Jicai performs this section, he does not superficially act out the appearance of being complacent and elated. Instead, he delves into the character's heart, thinking and feeling along the character's psychological clues. In this given situation, what is the character's demand (psychological action)? It is nothing else but eagerly and confidently waiting for the herald to announce the good news. Look, how confident this old scholar is in this exam: "After entering the examination hall, I wrote three essays in a row. If the examiner wants a poem, I give him a poem; if he wants a parallel antithetical couplet, I give him a parallel antithetical couplet." He returns to the inn with his head held high, his whole body radiating the air of being sure to win the first place. The innkeeper says, "Congratulations to the old scholar," and he replies with a "Good!" This "Good!" is not happiness, let alone humility, but approval. The innkeeper, fearing that he is tired, wants him to rest well, but he wants to sit upright all night; the innkeeper, fearing that he is cold, closes the door for him, but he says he wants to "open the dragon gate." From here, we see this old scholar sitting firmly in the center of the stage, instructing his page to pay attention to the time of the herald, and squinting his eyes, slowly savoring the endless joy of the so-called "golden list title" that is about to appear from the realm of his own thoughts. He thinks: the colored lanterns should be lit brightly, and the dragon gate should be opened wide, so that the herald can enter the door and respectfully kowtow a few congratulatory heads, and solemnly accept the report of his high score; tomorrow, he can wear palace flowers and ride a tall horse, parading through the streets in a grand show; after returning to his hometown, he can make those ordinary people who do not recognize talents tremble in front of him, admiring and envying him. Thinking of this, the skin on his old face seems to be a little numb, and his mouth seems to be sweet. As night deepens, after the first watch, there is no sound of the herald. Look at the gradually anxious look on his face. He laments his fate: "In the past, I was trapped in a cold window, working hard, hanging my head and pricking my thighs, enduring the cold and heat, morning and evening, enduring all kinds of hardships… Alas, my years are coming to an end, and I cannot wait for the first place to belong to an old man like me." At the second watch, the herald is still not there, and the old scholar is restless. Suddenly, the gong of the herald rings, and the herald passes through the stage. The old scholar can no longer hold back. He jumps out the door and intercepts the herald, questioning them for being careless in their work and why they went to the wrong door. Later, upon hearing the herald's answer, the report was of someone else's name. The old scholar's hands and feet suddenly turned cold, and he was dumbfounded. He could only anxiously ask: "Is there anyone named Shi among them... Shi Hao?" The herald casually replied, "He's behind!" Only then did the old scholar breathe a sigh of relief. He envies the pomp of these young people who have passed the exam, but he does not believe that these young people are truly virtuous and talented. He is very unconvinced. At the third watch, the herald's gong rings again. The merciless report is still of other people's names, and the old scholar is saddened once more. At this time, he felt the disillusionment of hope again, and thought of "returning home, it will be difficult to see my wife, and I will be ashamed to face my relatives and neighbors on the street." He cried. When the play is performed here, there must be a turning point, because the character's task has changed. The character's psychological activity at the beginning was to eagerly await the herald's good news. This hope has become a bubble. The current question is how the actor can further explore the character's thoughts and find the thread for the development of this scene. This thread is to shift from eagerly waiting for the herald's good news to trying to find out the root cause of this failure. Regardless of whether Qiu Jicai consciously comprehended this, the result of his performance is correct. Look: he suppressed the sad emotions of disappointment, expelling all the evil thoughts he thought were wild and random at this time, and patted his head, forcing it to wake up, so that he could concentrate all his strength to think about this serious problem. He paced back and forth, repeatedly reciting the aphorisms of the examination essay: "...The examiner's topic is this... 'The superior man is firm but not contentious'... 'The superior man rectifies himself to rectify others, as if he does not know it. The superior man is truly great, with nothing that cannot be done. How can he be as stubborn as those petty men? Therefore, the superior man is firm but not contentious'..." He stood with his hands behind his back, frowning tightly, carefully checking in his mind while reciting the original text, always feeling that the tone was sonorous, every word was like a pearl, and there was nothing to criticize. He raised his head again to think, as if he saw every dark, tiny character jumping out of the examination paper and radiating brilliance. The more he thought about it, the more unconvinced he became. He cursed the examiner: "My article is only written this way, why can they pass and I can't pass?" He suspected that the examiner did not really understand "eight-legged essays," or that the article was too profound to be understood? Or was it because his talent was envied? After judging, he felt that the examiner was reliable and there was no problem. After thinking about it, he had to go back to himself to check again, so he traced back from himself to his ancestors for three generations, and none of them had committed sins or lost their virtue; he could not figure out the reason after thinking left and right. Suddenly, he figured it out: it turned out that when he was studying and entering school, he went to the headscarf shop to order a headscarf, and the shopkeeper spoke flatteringly, saying, "Sir, if you give me a little more money, I will help you make a solid headscarf, and I guarantee you will wear it for the rest of your life!" As soon as he discovered this point, he immediately vented his anger on the headscarf. He slammed the headscarf on the ground. The page wanted to pick it up to warm the teapot, but the old scholar felt that it would be insulting to culture, so he set up an incense table and offered it on the table, writing an essay to sacrifice the headscarf.

The play has reached its climax here. Qiu Jicai expresses the character's great passion with profound comprehension and strong expressiveness. He is extremely sad, having exhausted decades of effort in vain, but failing to earn an official hat to wear. Scholars seek fame and fortune in order to become officials, and when they become officials, they can hold the seal, use the red pen, and write imperial edicts. When Qiu Jicai sacrifices the headscarf and writes the sacrificial text, he shifts the focus of the play to a pen. He picks up the pen to write, his fingers trembling, saying, "After entering the examination hall nine times, I have spent a lot of effort, but this ink pen has never turned into a red pen. If it could be turned into a red pen, and I could sign a warrant, arrest a few people, and slap three or five palms, then I would be convinced!" When Qiu Jicai performs here, although he is criticizing the pen in a light tone, his emotions are very excited, because these few words are really from the bottom of the scholar's heart, and they are also the most heartbreaking words for a failed scholar. The old scholar hates this pen, and also feels sorry for this pen, because they have been dependent on each other for decades. He only hates that he has worn through the iron inkstone and sucked dry dozens of vats of ink, but why can't it blossom on the tip of the pen and change its color? Here, the old scholar also understands that complaining is useless, the pen is innocent, and he cannot blame it. The cause and effect of the failure are all in this harmful headscarf. This matter has been investigated clearly and there is no doubt about it. It is only sad that it is too late to accept the lessons of experience. This life is over, but he cannot close his eyes in peace. Qiu Jicai uses a tragic atmosphere to render this scene: he wipes his eyes, flicks off the candle flowers, and solemnly reads the sacrificial text, one word and one tear; as if after sacrificing the headscarf, he will draw his sword and commit suicide to thank the elders of Jiangdong. Seeing this, we feel that this is a wronged soul crying.

After sacrificing the headscarf, the play does not end. The true tragedy of this comedic character lies not in failing every exam, but in finally passing it in the end. This shows that people like Shi Hao were originally full of vitality, but in order to seek fame and fortune, they tied themselves with the ropes of eight-legged essays, studying hard until old age. In the end, although they mastered the eight-legged essays, they became withered and lifeless. This is such a great tragedy. Qiu Jicai's performance of this last section, due to his profound understanding, reaches a philosophical generalization.

The last section of the play unfolds and ends like this: it is almost dawn, and the last herald truly comes to the door. The old scholar closes the door and does not open it, his mind unable to turn around for a moment, not believing it is real. When the gong rings, he suddenly wakes up and hurries to open the door, but he rushes left and right and cannot find where the door is. The page opens the door, and the herald opens the report and respectfully presents it to the old scholar. The old scholar stares blankly, suddenly unable to see it; only his lips are trembling. After a long while, he reads out the large characters "First Class, Third Place, Tan Hua, Henan, Shi Hao." He blinks hard again, staring at the twelve large characters and chanting them silently, then shouts, "My son, you passed too!" What a powerful line! How does Qiu Jicai express this line? With happy emotions? Exclamatory emotions? Painful emotions? All of these are not enough to express the weight of that line. But the old artist has a way after all. His "My son, you passed too!" made me feel as if I had grabbed the enemy's neck, so relieved and so happy.

After shouting, the old scholar gradually catches his breath, his whole body a little paralyzed, and his legs a little weak. While instructing the herald to receive the reward below, he sings, "The old scholar also has this day, palace flowers are inserted obliquely on my hat, jade belt and purple robe, parading through the streets with joy and glory, let me sway and shake as I please." Qiu Jicai dances and sings, expressing the old scholar's ecstatic mood, but it looks like a struggle. He laughs heartily, but suddenly his legs go numb and he falls heavily. By the time everyone helps him up, he has lost eight or nine tenths of his old life. He sings the last song with his dying breath: "I have studied hard all my life, hoping to pass the exam. I feel a lot when I pass the high-level exam! Only after passing do I know that I am old. What is the point of passing the high-level exam?" This is the old scholar's lament, and also his final awakening. The play ends here.

There are many comedies in opera art, and "Sacrificing the Headscarf" in the Changde Gaoqiang of Xiang opera is one of the very best, with a very high style.

I think the reason why the old artist Qiu Jicai was able to perform this play so well is that he basically achieved the following two points.

1. When Qiu Jicai plays this ridiculous old scholar, he does not deliberately express the character's ridiculousness by winking or rationally expose the character's ugly nature, requiring the character to self-criticize in physical actions; but he thinks and acts according to the character's own life logic; treating the behavior and events that the character considers reasonable and credible in the given situation with a very serious attitude, while the audience considers them absurd and ridiculous.

2. When Qiu Jicai plays this character, he is good at using the exaggerated techniques in traditional comedy, concretely combining the various technical rules of clown performance with the creation of the image of Shi Hao. But he does not generally start from the rules of clown performance, but from the creation of the character; therefore, he is both disciplined and free in his stage actions; he has Shi Hao's personality and the characteristics of this play, but he does not destroy the inherent style of traditional comedy.

This play makes the generalization of the ugly image stronger. It gives people creative inspiration in the unique performing arts of the ugly. Of course, this play is not without its shortcomings in performance. For example, when sacrificing the headscarf, the old scholar asks the page to "kowtow," but the page deliberately misunderstands it as "knocking hands," making many gimmicks; another example is when the old scholar reads the report, he asks the page to hold the lamp, and the page deliberately raises the lamp high and lowers it low, almost burning the old scholar's eyebrows. There are quite a few situations like this. Perhaps these places are intentionally trying to express the two opposing personalities and psychologies of the simple page and the old scholar in the director's intention, seeking dramatic conflict from here. But I think this is deviating from the given situation of the play and the character's thought logic, and the result is destroying the style of this comedy. These things belong to the clichés in clown plays, and I think they cannot be used randomly. In the performance of the old artist Qiu Jicai, there are also some places where the comprehension is not appropriate and deliberate addition of humorous jokes to satirize the character, which should be paid attention to and overcome.

The imperial examination era has long passed, and the image of Shi Hao certainly cannot represent our era, but the idea that scholars should be superior to others and that the way for scholars to "seek office" is to hold the red pen and wield power and fortune over the people, this kind of residual poison is not completely absent in everyone in modern times. From this point of view, "Sacrificing the Headscarf" still has its educational significance today.

    谈讽刺喜剧“祭头巾”的优秀表演
    阿甲
    喜剧是以笑为武器来实现它的教育目的的。湘戏的“祭头巾”就表现了这种力量。“祭头巾”的故事是这样的：八十二岁的石灏，连赴八科未中，这一年，他又到京城赶考，发榜之前，焦急不安；便摘下头巾，撰文祭吊。忽然喜讯报来，此老惊喜若狂，终至昏厥。情节就这么简单，可是人物刻划得入木三分。
    这出戏唱的是高腔，前后唱六支曲子。这出戏的主角石灏原是丑扮，湘戏名丑丘吉彩老艺人，为了创造这个人物，曾访问过那些经过科举考试的老先生，观察他们的生活气度，经过自己的具体体验，创造出了一位八科未中但死不甘心的老相公的生动形象。戏曲表演技术中，有一种概括反派读书人的性格形象叫做“方巾丑”的，但丘吉彩表演石灏，并不是以方巾丑来硬套，而是从石灏这一特殊形象的塑造出发，创造性地运用了各种丑角以及方巾丑的表演技巧，因此，在他的表演里，我们看不出从丑角这个模型里翻印出来的胚子。石灏一出场，就使人看出这个老儒虽已老态龙钟，却还高傲非凡，是一位怀才不遇牢骚满腹的人物。他黑巾红袍，须发苍白，曲背耸肩，面目枯憔；但故意显得精神抖擞，摆出一付不服老的样子，好像枯树硬要开花。出场后，他唱：“三场毕，笑颜开，越思越想越开怀。文思涌来，文章颇快，今科定中不虚来，准有一顶乌纱戴！”丘吉彩演这段戏时，不是表面化地去表演得意洋洋，兴高彩烈的样子，而是钻在角色的心里，沿着角色的心理线索去思想，去感受。在这个规定情景中，角色的要求（心理动作）是什么呢？不是别的，而是迫切地又是十分有把握地在等待着报录者来报喜讯。你看，这个老相公是多么自信这一场的考试啊：“进得场去，一连做了三篇文章，试官大人要诗我就诗，要对我就对。”他趾高气扬地回到客店，浑身上下都带着高魁必中的神气。店家说了一句“与老相公道喜，”他回了一声“好！”这一声“好！”不是高兴，更不是谦虚，而是批准。店家怕他累了，要他好好休歇，他却要端坐通宵；店家怕他凉了，为他把门关上，他说要“敞开龙门”。从这里，我们看到这个老相公，稳稳当当地坐在台中，一面吩咐书僮注意报录的时刻，一面眯缝着眼睛从自己思索的意境里，慢慢体味那立刻就要出现的所谓“金榜题名时”的无穷乐趣。他想着：应当把彩灯点得亮亮的，把龙门敞得开开的，好让报录的进门来规规矩矩地叩几个喜头，隆隆重重地接受那张高科得中的报单；明天，好戴上宫花骑着高头骏马，在大街上游街示威；回乡后，好叫那些有眼不识泰山的凡夫俗子在自己面前战战兢兢，赞叹艳羡。他想到这里老脸的皮肉仿佛都有些发酥，嘴里也似乎是甜蜜蜜的了。夜深了，敲过初更，报录的没有声息。看他的脸上渐渐露出焦灼神色。他感慨着自己的命运：“昔年间寒窗受困，苦琢磨悬梁刺股，挨过了寒暑晨昏，受过了万苦千辛。……堪叹我年华将尽，盼不到龙头属老成。”二更天了，报录还是没有声息，老相公坐立不安。突然，报锣响了，报录的穿台而过，老相公再也沉不住气，他跳出门去，便将报录的截住，责问他们办事好不当心，为什么走错了门？后来一听报录者的回答，报的却是别人的姓名。老相公一时手脚发凉，目瞪口呆，只能急急巴巴地问着：“内中有没有一个姓石的……石灏啊？”报录的随口答了一声“在后啊！”这老儒这才喘过气来。他羡慕这些少年人高中的威风，但又不相信这些少年就是真正的贤俊，他很不服气。三更天，报录者的锣声又响了，无情的报单，仍是别人家的姓名，老相公又一次黯然伤神。这时候，他又感到了希望的幻灭，想到“归家去难见妻身，上长街愧对亲邻。”他哭了。戏演到这里，就要有所转折，因为角色的任务变了。上场时角色的心理活动是迫切地等待报录者的喜讯，这个希望已成泡影，当前的问题是要演员如何更深一层去挖掘角色的思想，找出这段戏向前发展的线索来。这条线索，就是从急切地等待报录者的喜讯，转到竭力去追查这一次落榜的根源。不管丘吉彩是否自觉地去这样体会，可是他表演的结果是正确的。你看：他抑制了失望的悲痛情绪，把这个时候他认为是胡思乱想的万斛邪念，统通驱逐出境，他拍拍脑袋，强迫它清醒过来，好集中全力来思索这个严重问题。他踱来踱去，反复地朗诵那篇考试文章的警句：“……试官大人出的题目是这个……‘君子贞而不谅也’……‘君子正己以正人，似不知者也，夫正大哉为君子，无可无不可，岂其硜硜然如彼小人哉？所以是：君子贞而不谅也。’……”他背着手，紧皱着眉头，一面在脑子里细细检查，一面背诵原文，总觉得声调铿锵，字字珠玑，无懈可击。他又昂起头来想，仿佛看到每一个乌光光的蝇头小楷，都从试卷里跳出来放射着珠光宝气。他越想越不服气，他咒骂试官大人：“我的文章只有这个做法，为什么他们就得中，我就不得中呀？”他怀疑试官大人是否真正懂得“八股”，或者是由于文章太深奥，使人不解其意？或者是由于才高遭忌？他判断之后，认为试官是可靠的，没有问题。想来想去，还是回到自己身上来检查一番，于是又从自己一身追查到祖宗三代，又都没有造过孽，亏损过阴德；左思右想也想不出道理来。猛然，他想出来了：原来在攻书入学之时，去头巾铺里定制头巾，掌柜的说话巴结，说是“相公，你多与我钱把银子，我帮你扎扎实实做一顶好头巾，我包管你这一世戴到老！”他一发现这点，立刻把满腔怨气发泄到头巾上去。他将头巾狠狠地摔在地下。书僮想捡起来去暖茶壶，这位老相公又觉得玷辱斯文，于是就摆起香案，把它供在桌上，撰文祭起头巾来。
    戏到这里，已经进入高潮。丘吉彩以深刻的体会和强烈的表现力来表达角色的巨大激情。他老大伤悲，白白将几十年心血耗尽，却挣不上一顶乌纱戴戴。读书人求取功名，原来是为了做官，做了官就好掌印，就要提红笔，批朱谕。丘吉彩在祭头巾撰祭文之时，将戏的焦点转移到一枝笔上，他提笔撰文，手指哆嗦，说是“进了九次科场，花了许多心血，这枝墨笔总总不曾变成一枝红笔。若得变成一枝红笔，标一支签，拿个把人，打三五个手心，我的心中才是服了的哟！”丘吉彩演到这里，虽是以轻松的口吻，对笔作幽默的批评，可是情感很激动，因为这几句话实在是读书人心窝里的话，也是落第文人最伤心的话。老相公恨这支笔，又痛这支笔，因为几十年来相依为命，只恨磨穿铁砚，吸干了几十缸墨水，为什么不能在笔尖上开开花，变变颜色？这里，老相公又明白发牢骚无啥用处，笔无罪，不能怨它。落第的前因后果，全在这顶害人的头巾，这件事查得清清楚楚没有可怀疑的了。可悲的只是要接受经验教训已经来不及了，今生已矣，但是死不瞑目。丘吉彩是以悲剧气氛来渲染这个场面的：他擦擦眼睛，弹掉烛花，严肃地在朗读祭文，一字一泪；好像祭完头巾，就要拔剑自刎、以谢江东父老似的。看到这里，使我们感到这是一个被损害了的魂灵在哭诉。
    祭完头巾，戏并没有结束。这个喜剧人物真正的悲剧性，还不在于科科不中，却在于最后终于中了。这说明像石灏这样的人，本来是生气勃勃的，只为了求取功名利禄，用八股绳索把自己捆上，皓首穷经，到后来，八股虽然是通了，可是人也成了槁木死灰，这是多么大的悲哀。丘吉彩演这最后一段戏，由于体会的深刻，达到了哲学的概括。
    最后的这一段戏，是这样展开和结束的：天快亮了，最后一次报录的真正找上门来了，老相公闭门不开，头脑里一下子转不过弯来，不相信是真的。等到锣声一响，他这才突然清醒过来，急忙去开门，左冲右撞竟摸不着门在那里。书僮开了门，报录的将报单打开，恭恭敬敬地献在老相公面前，老相公两眼一瞪，忽然视而不见；只见他两片嘴唇在发抖，好一忽儿才念出“第一甲第三名探花河南石灏”这行大字。他再用劲眨眨眼睛，死盯住那十二个大字默念一遍，然后喊了一声“我的儿呀，你也中了！”这是多么有力的一句台词！丘吉彩怎样来表现这句台词儿的呢？用高兴的感情？感叹的感情？痛苦的感情？所有这些，都不足以表现那句台词的分量。可是老艺人毕竟有办法的，他那一声“我的儿呀，你也中了！”使我有这样的感受，好像一把掐住了仇人的脖子那么解恨，那么痛快。
    老相公喊了一声之后，才渐渐喘过气来，浑身有点瘫痪，两腿有点发软。他一面吩咐报子到下面领赏，一面唱着“老相公也有今朝，宫花斜插帽，玉带紫罗袍，打马游街喜荣耀，一任我摆摆摇摇。”丘吉彩边舞边唱，表达了老相公狂喜的心情，但看起来实在是一种挣扎。他哈哈大笑，忽然两脚一麻，扎扎实实地摔了一交，等到大家将他扶起，一条老命已经去掉十之八九。他气息奄奄地唱了最后一支曲子：“一生苦读望登科，得中高科感慨多！中后才知年已迈，高科中了又如何？”这是老相公的哀鸣，也是最后的觉醒。戏到这里就完了。
    戏曲艺术中喜剧很多，湘戏中常德高腔的“祭头巾”是其中非常优秀的一个，风格很高。
    老艺人丘吉彩所以能把这出戏演得那么好，我想这是由于他基本上做到了以下两点。
    一、丘吉彩扮演这个可笑的老儒，不是挤眉弄眼故意去表现角色的滑稽可笑，或是理性地去暴露角色的丑恶本质，要角色在形体动作上做自我批评；而是根据角色自己的生活逻辑去思考，去行动；以十分严肃的态度去对待角色规定情景中认为合理可信，而观众认为荒谬可笑的行为和事件。
    二、丘吉彩演这个人物，善于运用传统喜剧中夸张的手法，把丑行各种技术规律和石灏形象的创造具体地结合起来。但不是一般地从丑行的规律出发，而是从角色的创作出发；因而他在舞台动作上既守规矩又很自由；有石灏的个性，有这个戏的特点，但并不破坏传统喜剧的固有风格。
    这出戏，使丑的形象概括性更强了。在丑的特有的表演艺术上，给人以创造上的启发。当然，这出戏在表演上不是没有缺点的，如祭头巾时，老相公叫书僮“叩首”，而书僮故意误解为“扣手”，搞了许多噱头；又如老相公念报单时叫书僮掌灯，书僮故意将灯一忽儿升高，一忽儿降低，几乎把老相公的眉毛烧掉。像这类情形也还不少。这些地方，或许是在导演意图上有意去表现纯朴的书僮和老相公两种对立的性情和心理，从这里去寻求戏剧的冲突。但我觉得这是脱离了戏的规定情景，脱离了角色的思想逻辑，其结果是破坏了这出喜剧的风格的。这类东西，都属于丑戏中的俗套，我以为是不可以乱用的。在丘吉彩老艺人的表演上，也有些体会的不合适以及添加滑稽笑料故意去讽刺角色的地方，这是应当注意克服的。
    科举时代早就过去了，石灏的形象，当然不可能代表我们的时代，但是认为读书人要高人一头，读书人“求仕”之道，就是为了好掌握朱笔，在人民头上作威作福，这种遗毒，并不是在现代每一个人身上都毫无残留的。从这点来说，“祭头巾”在今天也还是有它的教育意义的。
