    Producing Good Pacifiers for Babies
    The rubber tips of pacifiers sold on the market are generally quite hard, and not suitable for babies under five months old. Because babies under five months old have very little sucking strength, if the pacifier rubber is too hard, babies have to work very hard to suck milk, and their tongues get sore before they have even finished one feeding. Some babies cry as soon as they are presented with a pacifier. I hope that factories that manufacture pacifiers will produce some softer pacifiers. For the sake of our babies, the commercial departments have a responsibility to allocate some good rubber to the factories, just as Vice Chairman Soong Ching Ling said: "Give the most precious things to the children!"

    为婴儿生产好奶嘴
    市场上卖的奶嘴的胶皮头一般比较硬，不适合五个月以下的婴儿使用。因为五个月以下的婴儿吸吮力很小，奶嘴橡皮过硬，婴儿吸奶时很费力，舌头都磨痛了还没吃饱一顿奶。有的婴儿一碰到奶嘴就哭。我希望制造奶嘴的工厂制造一些比较软的奶嘴。为了我们的婴儿，商业部门有责任给工厂调拨一些好橡胶，像宋庆龄副委员长所说的：“把最宝贵的东西给儿童！”　（阿姨）
