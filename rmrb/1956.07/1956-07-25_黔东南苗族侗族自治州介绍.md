The Southeast Guizhou Miao and Dong Autonomous Prefecture, the first autonomous prefecture established in Guizhou Province, is located in the southeastern part of Guizhou Province, adjacent to the Xiangxi Miao Autonomous Prefecture. It governs twelve counties, including Zhenyuan, Jianhe, Huangping, Shibing, Sansui, Cengong, Tianzhu, Jinping, Majiang, Liping, Rongjiang, and Congjiang, as well as four Miao autonomous counties: Lushan, Leishan, Taijiang, and Danzhai. It covers an area of approximately 25,900 square kilometers, with a population of over 1.8 million, including over 696,000 Miao people, over 436,000 Dong people, over 10,000 people from Buyi, Shui, Yao, and Zhuang ethnic groups, and over 570,000 Han people.

The autonomous prefecture features the Miao Mountains with overlapping peaks, as well as the beautiful Qingshui River, Yanghe River, and Duliu River. The area surrounding Leigong Mountain, the main peak of the Miao Mountains, is the main settlement area for the Miao people in Guizhou Province, including the three Miao autonomous counties of Leishan, Taijiang, and Danzhai, as well as Jianhe County. From the Qing Dynasty to the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, the Miao people here not only waged tenacious struggles against nature, but also carried out heroic armed struggles against the reactionary rulers of the time in the steep mountainous areas. The Qingshui River, which originates from Yunwu Mountain in Guiding County in central Guizhou, is the main river running through the Miao Mountain area. The Miao people, who are good at singing and dancing, have composed many songs praising the Qingshui River to express their love for their hometown. Tianzhu and Jinping counties, located in the lower reaches of the Qingshui River, are Dong settlements, rich in grain and timber.

This area, with its rolling mountains, crisscrossing rivers and streams, abundant rainfall, and mild climate, is well-suited for developing agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry. In the six years since liberation, under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, people of all ethnic groups have achieved remarkable results in production. By the end of 1955, the cultivated land area had reached more than 3.1 million mu, and the total grain output was more than 1.16 billion jin. While mobilizing farmers to plant trees and cultivate seedlings, the state forestry industry departments have harvested more than 587,000 cubic meters of timber in seven counties, including Tianzhu, Jinping, and Leishan Miao Autonomous County, which are rich in fir and pine. If this timber were used as railroad ties, it could be used to build more than 1,380 kilometers of single-track broad-gauge railway. In terms of animal husbandry, by the end of 1955, there were more than 430,000 head of cattle and more than 500,000 pigs and sheep. This spring, in the upsurge of agricultural cooperativization across the province, more than 90% of the farmers in the autonomous prefecture joined cooperatives, organizing more than 4,700 agricultural producers' cooperatives.

The underground mineral resources here are even richer. There are not only mercury mines that have already been mined, oil mines that are being explored, iron and gold mines that have not yet been mined, but also many coal mines.

With the development of production, there are currently 20 roads in the autonomous prefecture that can be used by cars and horse-drawn carriages, with a total length of more than 1,000 kilometers. The Lei (shan) Tai (jiang) Jian (he) highway, which started construction in February this year, is a transportation artery in the minority areas of southeastern Guizhou and is about to be completed and opened to traffic. The navigable mileage of waterways has now reached 1,200 kilometers, and the waterways have been widened and deepened.

In terms of culture, education, and health, there are already 13 junior high schools, 2 full middle schools, and 1 normal school in the autonomous prefecture. Minority students account for more than half of the students in these schools. There are more than 1,300 primary schools, with more than 126,000 students from all ethnic groups, and minority students account for more than 58%. More than 150,000 farmers in rural areas have participated in night schools and year-round literacy schools. There are already 14 county people's hospitals, 2 comprehensive people's hospitals, 77 district health centers, and many malaria prevention stations and groups, maternal and child health stations, etc. in the autonomous prefecture.

The people of all ethnic groups in the autonomous prefecture love their hometown. Before the first session of the First People's Congress of the Southeast Guizhou Miao and Dong Autonomous Prefecture was held, Miao singers sang about this place:

　　It used to be said that Guizhou had no three days of sunshine,
　　Now there is sunshine everywhere;
　　It used to be said that the people of Guizhou had no three cents of silver,
　　Now the yellow soil has turned into gold;
　　It used to be said that the roads in Guizhou were not flat,
　　We say that treasures are buried under the mountains. (Attached picture)

    黔东南苗族侗族自治州介绍
    新华社记者　吴振全
    黔东南苗族侗族自治州，是贵州省第一个成立的自治州，位于贵州省东南部，和湘西苗族自治州相连，辖镇远、剑河、黄平、施秉、三穗、岑巩、天柱、锦屏、麻江、黎平、榕江、从江等十二个县和炉山、雷山、台江、丹寨等四个苗族自治县。面积约二万五千九百多平方公里，一百八十多万人，其中苗族六十九万六千多人，侗族四十三万六千多人，布依、水家、瑶、僮等族一万多人，汉族五十七万多人。
    自治州境内有峰峦重叠的苗岭山脉，有美丽的清水江、?阳河和都柳江等河流。苗岭山脉主峰雷公山的周围，是贵州省苗族的主要聚居区，包括雷山、台江、丹寨三个苗族自治县和剑河县。从清朝到国民党反动统治时期，这里的苗族人民不仅向自然界作顽强斗争，并且在险峻的山区向当时反动统治者进行了英勇的武装斗争。起源于贵州中部贵定县云雾山的清水江，是横贯苗岭山区的主要河流，善歌善舞的苗家编唱了许多赞颂清水江的歌曲，以抒发热爱家乡的心情。清水江下游的天柱和锦屏县，是侗族聚居地区，盛产粮食和木材。
    在这个山峦起伏、河溪纵横、雨量充沛、气候温和的地方，很适宜发展农业、林业和畜牧业。解放六年来，各族人民在共产党和人民政府领导下，生产上已取得了显著成绩。到1955年年底止，耕地面积达到三百一十多万亩，粮食总产量十一亿六千多斤。在发动农民造林育苗的同时，国家森林工业部门曾在盛产杉、松的天柱、锦屏和雷山苗族自治县等七县，采伐了木材五十八万七千多立方公尺。这些木材如用作枕木，可以修单线宽轨铁路一千三百八十多公里。畜牧业方面，到1955年年底止，耕牛已达四十三万多头，猪羊五十多万只。今年春季在全省农业合作化高潮中，自治州90％以上的农户入了社，组织了四千七百多个农业生产合作社。
    这里的地下矿藏更是丰富。不仅有已经开采的汞矿，正在钻探的石油矿，尚未开采的铁矿、金矿，还有许多的煤矿等。
    随着生产的发展，目前自治州内能通汽车和马车的道路有二十条，长一千多公里，今年二月开工修建的雷（山）台（江）剑（河）公路，是黔东南少数民族地区的一条运输动脉，即将全部竣工通车。河道通航里程，现已达一千二百公里，而且航路已加宽加深。
    文教卫生方面，自治州内已有初级中学十三所，完全中学二所，师范学校一所。在这些学校里，少数民族学生占一半以上。小学有一千三百多所，各族学生达十二万六千多人，少数民族学生占58％以上。农村中参加夜校和常年民校学习的农民，已有十五万多人。自治州内已有十四所县人民医院，两个综合的人民医院，七十七个区卫生所，以及很多疟疾防治站和组、妇幼保健站等。
    自治州的各族人民都热爱自己的家乡。在黔东南苗族侗族自治州举行第一届人民代表大会第一次会议召开前夕，苗族的歌手们曾经这样歌唱这个地方：
    从前说贵州天无三日晴，
    如今啊这里充满阳光；
    从前说贵州人无三分银，
    如今啊黄土变成了金；
    从前说贵州路不平，
    我们说山下埋藏着宝藏。（附图片）
