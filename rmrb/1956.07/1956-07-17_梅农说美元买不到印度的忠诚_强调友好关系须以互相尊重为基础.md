Xinhua News Agency, New York, 16th: Indian Ambassador to the United Nations, Krishna Menon, emphasized on July 15th, when discussing the relationship between the United States and India, that no amount of aid can buy friendship, and friendly relations must be based on mutual respect.

Menon made these remarks to reporters yesterday on a New York television program. He refuted the idea that "you can buy friendship (with money)". He said that Indians would not be swayed by American aid, nor would they be swayed by Soviet aid. He said, "Not all the dollars you spend in India can buy our loyalty. Loyalty arises from your respect for us and our respect for you." When discussing the issue of aid, Menon stated that India is in favor of all foreign aid being channeled through the United Nations. He pointed out that the main objections to this approach come from Britain and the United States.

Menon said that if there has been any "deterioration" in US-Indian relations, it "was not caused by us (India)".

A reporter pointed out that US Vice President Nixon recently accused India of not making "moral distinctions" between the Soviet and American governmental systems, and asked him to comment on this. Menon said that it is not our place to distinguish between such differences. India recognizes the right of each country to adopt different governmental systems and believes that "if the people do not like that governmental system, they will overthrow it one day."

Menon told American reporters that the word "neutralism" is "inappropriate" to describe India's policy. India's attitude is: "Our policy is not predetermined by the obligations of this or that major power."

    梅农说美元买不到印度的忠诚
    强调友好关系须以互相尊重为基础
    据新华社16日讯　纽约消息：印度驻联合国代表克里希纳·梅农七月十五日在谈到美国和印度的关系问题时强调说，任何援助都不能购买友谊，友好关系必须以互相尊重为基础。
    梅农昨天是在纽约电视节目中对记者发表谈话的。他驳斥了“你能够（用金钱）买到友谊”的那种想法。他说，印度人不会被美国援助所左右，也不会被苏联援助所左右。他说：“并不是你们在印度花费的全部美元都可以买到我们的忠诚的，忠诚是由于你们对我们的尊重和我们对你们的尊重而产生的。”梅农在谈到援助问题的时候表示，印度赞成所有外援都通过联合国，他指出，对这种方针的主要的反对意见来自英国和美国。
    梅农说，如果说美—印关系有了任何“恶化”，那也“不是我们（印度）这方面造成的”。
    有记者指出美国副总统尼克松最近曾经指责印度对苏联和美国的政府制度不加“道德上的区别”，并且请他对这一点发表意见。梅农说，区分这种差别不是我们份内的事，印度承认各个国家有采取不同政府制度的权利，并且相信，“如果人民不喜欢那种政府制度，那么总有一天他们会把它推翻的”。
    梅农对美国记者说，用“中立主义”这种字眼来形容印度的政策是“不适当的”。印度的态度是：“我们的政策不是由这个或那个大国的义务所预先决定的”。
