　　Changsha Dispatch from our newspaper: Hunan Province has a promising harvest of early rice on more than 15 million mu of land. The province's grain departments are actively preparing for the storage of new grain. The grain departments in Xiangtan Prefecture are seeking out civilian granaries, cleaning up existing warehouses, and signing phased storage contracts with agricultural cooperatives. It is expected that the difficulties of insufficient storage capacity brought about by the bumper harvest can be overcome. Chen County Prefecture is carrying out large-scale warehouse cleaning and disinfection work, and the new granaries will be completed in mid-August. The Changde Prefecture Grain Bureau has ordered a batch of windmills, steelyards, drying mats, standard bamboo baskets and other utensils. The provincial New Grain Storage Preparation Office has been established.
