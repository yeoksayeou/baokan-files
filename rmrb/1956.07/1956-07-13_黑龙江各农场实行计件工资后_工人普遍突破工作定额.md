Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, July 11th: Since the Friendship, Jiusan, Hongxing, and other twenty-seven farms and ranches under the Heilongjiang Provincial State Farm Administration Bureau implemented piece-rate wages this spring, workers have universally exceeded their work quotas. In the Friendship, Hongxing, and Erlongshan farms, after implementing piece-rate wages, the wage income of tractor drivers and agricultural workers generally increased by 14% to 38% compared to the past. During the spring plowing season, work quotas for harrowing, soil compaction, and sowing were generally exceeded in all farms. The Friendship Farm exceeded its spring operation quota by an average of 15%, saving more than 1,100 catties of fuel for tractors and other machinery. In order to further improve labor efficiency, workers in various farms have put forward many rationalization proposals and improved work methods. Tractor drivers and agricultural workers at the Friendship Farm created a method of adding seeds without stopping during the spring plowing season, shortening auxiliary work time. Within one month, workers at the Erlongshan Farm put forward 532 rationalization proposals, helping the farm improve its operation and management.

Prior to implementing piece-rate wages, these twenty-seven farms and ranches universally revised and formulated various operation quotas, and established and improved various operation quality acceptance systems, thereby ensuring that the implementation of piece-rate wages could both improve workers' work efficiency and guarantee operation quality.

    黑龙江各农场实行计件工资后
    工人普遍突破工作定额
    新华社哈尔滨11日电　黑龙江省国营农场管理厅所属的友谊、九三、红星等二十七个农场、牧场今年春季实行计件工资以来，工人们普遍突破了工作定额。友谊、红星、二龙山三个农场在实行计件工资后，拖拉机手和农业工人的工资收入，普遍比过去增加了14％到38％。在春耕期间，各农场耙地、镇压和播种等作业定额普遍被突破。友谊农场春季作业平均超过定额15％，并节省拖拉机等油料一千一百多斤。为了进一步提高劳动效率，各场工人都提出了很多合理化建议和改进了工作方法。友谊农场拖拉机手和农业工人们在春耕时期创造了不停车的上种籽法，缩短了辅助工作时间。二龙山农场在一个月内，工人们就提出了合理化建议五百三十二件，帮助农场改进了经营管理工作。
    这二十七个农场、牧场在实行计件工资以前，曾普遍修改和制定了各项作业定额，建立和健全了各项作业质量验收制度，从而保证了实行计件工资后，既能提高工人的工作效率，又保证了作业质量。
