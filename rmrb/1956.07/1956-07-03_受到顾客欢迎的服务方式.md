    In Shanghai, whether on bustling avenues or quiet streets, there are many service-oriented shops that provide thoughtful services to customers based on their skills and equipment. Over the long years, these shops have accumulated a good set of experiences based on customer needs, considering the comfort and convenience of customers in everything from food and clothing to housing and daily necessities. After the joint public-private ownership of the entire industry, they further developed and improved these characteristics and came up with various ways to save people money and time, and to meticulously care for all aspects of people's well-being.

    It is very interesting to see their rich and diverse service methods and their consideration for customers in every way.

    For Those New to Shanghai

    At the Shanghai Railway Station, many passengers get off the train every night, and many of them are visiting this unfamiliar big city for the first time. In the past, the most troublesome thing for them was how to find a suitable place to stay in such a late hour. Now, they don't have to worry about this at all. In a hotel opposite the North Railway Station, there is a "Passenger Accommodation Service Station," where staff warmly greet every passenger. Under any circumstances, the service station can find a hotel in any corner of the city according to the needs of the passengers, and help them hire a car and carry their luggage without any cost, and settle them down. If some passengers are leaving Shanghai the next day, the service station can also purchase train tickets for them.

    The "Passenger Accommodation Service Station" is jointly established by twenty-nine joint public-private hotels in Zhabei District. Twelve staff members serve passengers from other places day and night. Since its establishment in early April, it has received more than 6,000 passengers in less than two months.

    "Fast Food" and Home Delivery

    Eating in Shanghai is also very convenient. More than 8,000 restaurants,饭店(fan4dian4) and snack shops supply people with various tastes and a wide variety of dishes and snacks. Many stores have a "fast food" supply. Customers sit down, and in just two or three minutes, the waiter brings the food to the table. People don't have to worry about delaying work or other things because of eating.

    In the kitchens of many restaurants, there are many stoves of all sizes, and the refrigerators are filled with pre-prepared raw vegetables. Chefs start preparing early in the morning, so as soon as they hear a customer order, they immediately start cooking. This is how they shorten the customer's waiting time.

    Many food shops in Shanghai have also implemented a home delivery service. As long as customers make a phone call, hot dishes and meals will be delivered to their door. Famous restaurants such as Da San Yuan, Xing Hua Lou, Mei Ya, and Qiao Jia Zha also actively go to factories, government offices, parties, and sports venues to supply food. Meilizhai Restaurant has used insulated buckets to deliver their famous rice and vegetables to the suburbs several times to supply picnicking people with picnics.

    Good Ways to Renew Broken Pants

    In terms of clothing, Shanghai clothing stores have also come up with many ways to save people money and make careful calculations. Even a pair of broken pants with two big holes worn on the buttocks can be restored to its original state by sewing workers. They turn the lining of the trouser legs to the buttocks, and then turn the worn-out parts to the bottom. This ingenious craftsmanship makes it impossible to see any traces. In this way, without adding an inch of fabric, the broken pants can be worn again.

    Remaking clothes is already an important service method in all Shanghai clothing stores. They also put a lot of thought into this aspect for customers. Just a woolen long gown can be remade into a set of Zhongshan suits, or a Western-style coat, a short coat, or a pair of men's and women's pants; a Chinese-style coat can be remade into a Zhongshan suit, a Western-style coat, or a short coat; a set of Western-style suits can be remade into a Zhongshan suit or a spring and autumn shirt; a woman's woolen cheongsam can also be remade into a two-way shirt or a pair of Western-style pants. Old men's Western-style pants can be remade into women's pants or skirts, and even worn-out clothes can be remade into children's clothing. Their remaking technology is excellent, and the remade clothes are no less stylish than new ones.

    Some shirt stores and garment shops in Shanghai also operate a shirt exchange business. If the collar of your shirt is torn, but other parts are still good, they can replace the collar for you, or they can turn the collar over. Some white shirt collars are pre-made, and customers can take off their shirts and put on a new collar on the spot.

    No Need to Go Out to Wash and Dye Clothes

    Some factories and schools in Shanghai now have a "laundry service box." This is a new way for laundry stores to serve customers after the joint public-private ownership. Workers and students only need to write the clothes they want to wash, the address, and when they want them to be washed on a piece of paper, and put it in the box. The laundry store staff will come to pick up the goods and deliver them back clean and ironed on time. In this way, people who are busy with work and study no longer have to carry dirty clothes and quilts to the store to wash.

    After the joint public-private ownership, laundry stores have also expanded the washing and dyeing business of small items. They proposed: "From top to bottom (referring to hats to socks), from inside to outside (underwear to outerwear), regardless of size, all services are provided." Laundry stores in Xuhui District now wash socks, towels, masks, handkerchiefs, and sleeves for customers, and the price is only one or two cents. Washing a pair of sneakers is only ten cents. If customers don't have money at the moment, they can also collect the money once on the date specified by the customer (such as when workers are paid).

    Many laundry stores can also apply glue to customers' old raincoats and disassemble and wash old cotton clothes. Cotton-padded jackets and trousers that have been worn for a winter are always dirty and heavy. The laundry store will disassemble the cotton, re-fluff it, turn it over, wash the face and lining clean, dye the faded ones, and sew on the missing buttons and repair the broken places. When winter comes next year, you will feel like you have added a new cotton coat.

    受到顾客欢迎的服务方式
    穆青　叶世涛
    在上海，不管是繁华的马路、静僻的街巷，都开设着很多服务性商店，他们凭着自己的技术和设备，周到地为顾客服务。在过去悠久的岁月里，这些商店已经根据顾客的需要积累了一套很好的经验，无论是吃的穿的、住的用的，都能够处处为顾客的舒适和方便着想。这次全行业公私合营后，他们又进一步发扬和改进了这些特点，并且想出各种办法，节约人们的金钱、时间，细致地体贴人们生活中的一切福利问题。
    看看他们丰富多样的服务方式和处处为顾客着想的情形是一件令人很感兴趣的事情。
    为了初来上海的人们
    在上海的火车站上，每天夜晚都有很多下车的旅客，他们当中有不少人是第一次来到这个陌生的大城市。过去，最使他们伤脑筋的是在这样的深夜如何找一个合适的住处。现在，他们完全不必为这件事担心了。在北火车站对面的一家旅馆里，有一个“旅客投宿服务站”，在那里，工作人员会热情地招待每一位旅客，不管在任何情况下，服务站都可以根据旅客的需要在市区任何一个角落找到旅馆，并且毫无代价地代他们雇车、提行李，一直安置他们住下。如果有些旅客隔天就要离开上海，服务站还可以给他代购火车票。
    “旅客投宿服务站”是闸北区二十九家公私合营旅馆联合设立的，十二个工作人员日夜为外地旅客服务，从四月初设立以来，不到两个月的时间已经接待了六千多位旅客。
    “快餐”和送饭上门
    吃在上海也是一件很方便的事情。八千多家菜馆、饭店和点心店供应人们各种口味、多种多样的饭菜、点心。许多店都有一种“快餐”供应，顾客坐下来，只要二三分钟，服务员就把饭菜端上来了，人们根本不用担心因为吃饭而耽误工作或其他事情。
    不少饭店的厨房里，放置着大大小小许多炉灶，冰箱里盛着事先配好的生菜，厨师们一早就开始准备工作，因此只要一听到顾客点菜，立刻下锅烹饪。他们就是这样来缩短顾客等待时间的。
    上海许多饮食店还实行了上门供应的服务方法，只要顾客打一个电话去，热菜热饭就会送上门来。著名的大三元、杏花楼、美雅、乔家栅等饮食店还主动到工厂、机关、联欢会、运动会场去供应。美味斋饭店已经好几次用保暖桶装着他们有名的菜饭到郊区供应郊游人们野餐了。
    破裤子翻新的好办法
    在穿的方面，上海的服装店也想出了许多节约的办法为人们精打细算。即使是一条屁股上已经磨成两个大洞的破裤子，缝纫工人也会把它整旧如新。他们把裤脚管内衬的料子翻到屁股上，再把破烂的地方倒在下面，这种精巧的手艺，使人一点也看不出痕迹。这样，不增加一寸布料，破裤子又能再穿了。
    改制服装已经是目前上海所有服装店一个重要的服务方法。他们在这方面为顾客动的脑筋也是很多的。光是一件本人的呢料长衫，就能改一套人民装，也可以改西装大衣、短大衣或是男裤女裤各一条；一件中式大衣可以改成人民装、西装大衣、短大衣；一套本人的西装可以改人民装或是春秋衫；一件妇女的呢料旗袍也可以改一件两用衫或是一条西装裤。旧的男式西装裤可以改女裤、女裙，那怕是穿破的衣服也能改成孩子的童装。他们这种改制的技术是高明的，改出来的服装，式样并不亚于新的。
    上海还有一些衬衫店和成衣铺兼营衬衫换领的业务。如果你的衬衫领子破烂了，而其他地方还是很好的，他们可以给你换领，也可以给你翻领，有些白色的衬衫领子是他们事先做好的，顾客脱下衬衫，当场可以换上新领子。
    洗染衣物不用出门
    上海一些工厂、学校里，现在有了一只“洗染服务箱”，这是洗染店公私合营后为顾客服务的新办法。工人、学生只要在纸条上写明要洗的衣服、地址，希望什么时候洗好，丢进箱子，洗染店的服务员就会上门接货，按期洗熨得干干净净地送来。这样，忙于工作和学习的人们不用再挟着脏衣脏被上店去洗了。
    洗染店在公私合营后还扩大了小件衣物的洗染业务，他们提出：“从上到下（指从帽子到鞋袜），从里到外（内衣裤到外衣），不论大小，一律服务”。徐汇区的洗染店现在替顾客洗袜子、毛巾、口罩、手帕和袖套，价格只有一、二分钱，洗一双球鞋也只有一角。如果顾客们一时没有钱，他们还可以在顾客指定的日期（如工人发工资的时候）去一次收款。
    许多洗染店还能替顾客的旧雨衣上胶、旧棉衣拆洗。穿了一个冬季的棉袄棉裤，总是又脏又重，洗染店会给你拆去棉花，重新弹过、翻过，把面子和夹里都洗干净，褪色的还给你染色，掉了的扣子也会补上，破了的地方又重新补好。到来年冬天的时候，你就好像又添置一件新棉衣一样。
