    The Tenacity of the Soviet People
    A Man Who Lost Both Legs Becomes an Associate Doctor
    Not long ago, at the academic thesis defense meeting of the Moscow Aviation Technology Institute, the institute's academic committee unanimously approved Klyucharev as an Associate Doctor of Technical Sciences. Finally, the dean read the author's autobiography. When he read, "…Lost both legs in 1944…," the hall buzzed. No one who didn't know would have thought that the robust man in front of them had no legs.
    …Klyucharev was only eighteen years old when he left Liangzan City to join the army in 1939. Two years later, the anti-fascist war began, and he and his troops were stationed on the border of the motherland. Initially, he was an artilleryman and was wounded twice in combat. Later, he served as a cavalryman in the heroic Cossack troops for a time, and after his third injury, he became an infantryman. Whether as an artilleryman, cavalryman, or infantryman, Klyucharev never bowed his head in the face of difficulties. He was a humorist and a skilled singer. In 1944, Klyucharev's unit drove the enemy from Minsk to the border of Vilnius, where he was seriously injured.
    Klyucharev woke up in the hospital. He then discovered that he was missing two legs, one cut off above the knee and the other below the knee... While still in the hospital, Klyucharev was determined to walk on artificial legs like a normal person and devote himself to science.
    After being discharged from the hospital, Klyucharev went to the Moscow Aviation Institute and joined the Party here. At school, he served as the chairman of the trade union, enthusiastically organizing various evenings and dances for everyone, and dancing himself. Comrades sometimes called him "Admiral," because once Klyucharev led a boating trip, and people discovered that he was a swimmer. In family life, he was also not behind, often running to the store to buy things for his family, cooking when necessary, and even washing diapers.
    Klyucharev became a graduate student because of his excellent grades. At the time of graduation, he often ran to the suburbs for internships to write his thesis, sometimes having to walk several miles, and then work next to the machine for a day. When his associate doctoral thesis was approved at the defense meeting, everyone who attended the defense meeting warmly welcomed this steel warrior in the scientific community who had lost his legs.

    The Young Poet Who Grew Up in Bed
    In Boloven Village, Kurgan Oblast, Soviet Union, a young man named Kulikov lies in bed, holding a small mirror in his hand, watching the surroundings through the mirror, because he cannot get out of bed, turn around, or even turn his head. Fifteen years ago, Kulikov suffered from ankylosing spondylitis, and no medical treatment was effective. The doctors were saddened by him, but Kulikov remained optimistic. He wrote a poem to the doctor, which reads:
    "…Like a small beetle nailed down.
    …But the beetle's mood is not low at all,
    At such a moment,
    I still want to sing and make music…"
    During the Great Patriotic War, he and his mother moved from Leningrad to Boloven Village, Kurgan Oblast. Kulikov completed his ten-year correspondence course on a bed in his own home and began to embark on the path of creation, becoming a poet. He has close ties with the children in the village, writing poems and fairy tales for them. His recent book "Why Hedgehogs Have So Many Thorns" is very popular with children. Elementary school students in the village often read his works at evening parties. At the All-Soviet Young Writers Conference, people praised the populism, enthusiasm, and humor in the works of this young poet.

    苏维埃人的顽强意志
    失去双腿的人当了副博士
    不久前，在莫斯科航空技术学院的一次学术论文答辩会上，学院的学术委员会一致通过了克留恰列夫为技术科学副博士。最后，院长宣读论文作者的自传。当他读到“……1944年失去了双腿……”的时候，大厅里哄起来了。不知道的人谁也没有想到面前的这个健壮的人是没有腿的。
    ……克留恰列夫在1939年离开了良赞市去参军的时候，才十八岁。两年后，反法西斯战争开始了，他随着部队驻守在祖国的边境。起初他是炮兵，在作战中曾两次受伤。后来他一度当过英勇的哥萨克部队的骑兵，在第三次负伤后他又改当步兵。无论是当炮兵、骑兵或步兵克留恰列夫从来没在困难面前低过头。他是个诙谐家、唱歌的能手。1944年，克留恰列夫所在的部队把敌人从明斯克赶到边境维尔纽斯，就在这里他受了重伤。
    克留恰列夫苏醒过来的时候是在医院里。这时他发现自己缺少了两条腿，一条在膝盖上割断了，另一条在膝盖下割断了……。还在医院里，克留恰列夫就下定决心用假腿像好人一样地走路，并献身于科学。
    克留恰列夫出院以后到莫斯科进了莫斯科航空工艺学院，并且在这里入了党。在学校里，他担任工会主席，热心为大家组织各种晚会、舞会，而且自己也跳舞。同志们有时叫他“海军上将”，原因是，有一次克留恰列夫领导划船旅行，途中人们发现他是个游泳家。在家庭生活中，他也不落后，常常跑到商店里去给家里买东西，必要时也做饭，甚至洗尿布。
    克留恰列夫因优良成绩成为研究生。在结业时，他为了作论文常常跑到郊外去实习，有时必须步行好几里地，而接着还要在机器旁边干一天。当他的副博士论文在答辩会上被通过的时候，参加答辩会的所有的人都热烈欢迎这位失去双腿的科学界的钢铁战士。
    在病床上成长的青年诗人
    在苏联库尔干州波罗文村里，一个年青人库里科夫躺在一张床上，手里拿着一个小镜子，从镜子里观看周围的东西，因为他不但起不了床，转不了身，而且头也不能转动一下。十五年前，库里科夫患了关节强硬症，任何医疗也无济于事。医生们都为他难过，但库里科夫仍然很乐观，他给医生写了一首诗，诗中写道：
    “……像被钉子钉住的小甲虫。
    ……但甲虫的情绪一点也不低落，
    在这样的时刻，
    我还要吟诗作乐……”
    在卫国战争期间，他和母亲一起从列宁格勒迁到库尔干州波罗文村。库里科夫就在自己家中的一张床上完成了十年制的函授学习，并开始走上创作的道路，成了诗人。他和村子里的孩子们有密切的联系，为他们写诗和童话。他最近出版的书“为什么刺猬有那么多的刺”很受孩子们的欢迎。村里小学生们在晚会上常常朗读他的作品。在全苏青年作家大会上，人们对这个青年诗人作品中的人民性、热情和幽默备加赞扬。
