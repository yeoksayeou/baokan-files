Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, July 20th. The Special Military Tribunal of the Supreme People's Court of the People's Republic of China tried twenty-eight Japanese war criminals, including Takebe Rokuzo, in Shenyang from July 1st to 20th.

These war criminals all held various important military and political positions in the puppet state of Manchuria. The court sentenced the twenty-eight defendants to fixed-term imprisonment ranging from twelve to twenty years.

The court trial confirmed that these twenty-eight Japanese war criminals, after invading the northeastern region of China, had committed crimes in various capacities, including actively implementing the Japanese imperialist policy of aggression, supporting the Japanese imperialist war of aggression against China, manipulating or participating in the manipulation of the puppet Manchurian government, usurping China's national sovereignty, and violating international law and humanitarian principles.

In the solemn courtroom, the state prosecutor sternly accused these war criminals of their serious crimes. Pu Yi, the former puppet emperor of Manchuria, and Wang Xianwei, the former vice-minister of the General Affairs Agency of the puppet Manchurian State Council, appeared in court to testify. Many victims and relatives of victims also testified in court. Faced with a large amount of conclusive evidence, the defendants confessed their crimes in court.

Nineteen lawyers appeared in court to defend the defendants.

The court gave the defendants the opportunity to state their opinions.

The Special Military Tribunal, in accordance with the spirit of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress's decision on handling war criminals in custody who committed war crimes during Japan's invasion of China, finally sentenced the twenty-eight defendants. The Special Military Tribunal sentenced Takebe Rokuzo, former Chief of General Affairs of the puppet Manchurian State Council, to twenty years' imprisonment; Furuhata Tadashi, former Vice-Minister of the General Affairs Agency of the puppet Manchurian State Council, to eighteen years' imprisonment; Saito Yoshio, former Major General and Chief of the Gendarmerie Training Center of the puppet Manchurian State Council, to twenty years' imprisonment; Nakai Kyuji, former Director of the Judicial Correction Bureau of the puppet Ministry of Justice, to eighteen years' imprisonment; Miyake Hideya, former Director of the Police Department of Fengtian Province and Director of the Local Security Bureau, to eighteen years' imprisonment; Yokoyama Mitsuhiko, former Deputy President of the Harbin High Court and President of the Special Public Security Court, to sixteen years' imprisonment; Sugihara Kazusaku, former Director of the Criminal Affairs Division and Chief of the Thought Section of the puppet Ministry of Justice, to eighteen years' imprisonment; Sako Tatsusuke, former Major General and Commander of the Mudanjiang Railway Guard Brigade, to eighteen years' imprisonment; Hara Hiroshi, former Major General and Chief of Staff of the Railway Guard Army, to sixteen years' imprisonment; Kibe Yohei, former Governor of Jiandao Province of the puppet Manchurian State, to fifteen years' imprisonment; Imayoshi Hitoshi, former Chief of the Police Affairs Section of the Police Affairs Bureau, to sixteen years' imprisonment; Utsugi Takeo, former Lieutenant Colonel and Commander of the Japanese Gendarmerie in Jiamusi, to thirteen years' imprisonment; Taii Kyujiro, former Chief of the Special Affairs Section of the Qiqihar City Police Bureau, to sixteen years' imprisonment; Kimura Mitsuaki, former Major Attached to the Third Special Guard Unit of the Japanese Kwantung Army, to sixteen years' imprisonment; Shimamura Saburo, former Chief of the Investigation Section of the Special Affairs Division of the Police Affairs Bureau, to fifteen years' imprisonment; Kage Shigeharu, former Chief of the Police Affairs Section of the Jinzhou City Police Bureau, to fifteen years' imprisonment; Tsukidani Shozo, former Chief of the Judicial Section and Chief of the Special Investigation Team of the Binjiang Province Police Department, to fifteen years' imprisonment; Yoshihusa Torao, former Lieutenant Colonel and Senior Adjutant of the Headquarters of the Japanese Kwantung Gendarmerie, to fourteen years' imprisonment; Kashiwaba Yuichi, former Chief of the Fushun City Police Bureau, to fifteen years' imprisonment; Fujiwara Hironoshin, former Major and Squad Leader of the Japanese Gendarmerie in Xinjing, to fourteen years' imprisonment; Uetsubo Tetsuiichi, former Lieutenant Colonel and Commander of the Japanese Gendarmerie in Siping, to twelve years' imprisonment; Hachisuka Shigeo, former Colonel and Commander of the Fengtian Railway Guard Regiment, to twelve years' imprisonment; Horiguchi Masao, former Lieutenant Colonel and Commander of the Japanese Gendarmerie in Jinzhou, to twelve years' imprisonment; Nozaki Shigeyuki, former Chief of the Police Affairs Section of the Huaide County Police Bureau in Jilin Province, to fourteen years' imprisonment; Mizoguchi Yoshio, former Prosecutor of the Harbin High Prosecutor's Office, to fifteen years' imprisonment; Shimura Yukio, former Lieutenant Colonel and Commander of the Training Unit of the First Special Guard Unit of the Japanese Kwantung Army, to twelve years' imprisonment; Kobayashi Kiichi, former Major and Commander of the Japanese Gendarmerie in Hinggan, to twelve years' imprisonment; and Nishinaga Shoji, former Major and Squad Leader of the Japanese Gendarmerie Daoli Sub-division in Harbin, to twelve years' imprisonment. The court ruled that the terms of imprisonment for all defendants would be calculated from the date of the verdict, and that the number of days of detention before the verdict would be counted as one day for one day of imprisonment.

Xinhua News Agency, July 20th. The Supreme People's Procuratorate of the People's Republic of China simultaneously announced on July 18th in Fushun and Taiyuan the decision to grant exemption from prosecution to 328 war criminals in custody who committed war crimes during Japan's invasion of China, and ordered their immediate release.

This is the second group of Japanese war criminals with relatively minor crimes and better expressions of repentance released by the Chinese government.

These released Japanese have already left the Fushun and Taiyuan Japanese War Criminals Management Offices on the day of their release. Representatives from the Red Cross Society of China dispatched to the two locations received them and, on the 19th, assisted them in taking trains from Fushun and Taiyuan to Tianjin, respectively, in preparation for boarding ships back to Japan.

The decision to grant exemption from prosecution was announced by Procurator Feng Rongchang and Procurator I No Suke Kuni, designated by Zhang Dingcheng, Procurator-General of the Supreme People's Procuratorate, in Fushun and Taiyuan, respectively. A total of 296 people were released in Fushun, and 32 in Taiyuan. After the procurators and representatives of the Red Cross Society of China completed the handover procedures, the representatives of the Red Cross Society of China expressed to these released Japanese their willingness to do their best to help them solve the difficulties during their journey.

When the decision to grant exemption from prosecution was announced, many of these Japanese who were granted leniency were moved to tears. Some made speeches on the spot, expressing their deep gratitude for the lenient treatment by the Chinese people. The Japanese war criminals released in Fushun also took an oath on the spot, stating that they would definitely contribute their strength to opposing war, maintaining peace, and promoting friendship between the Chinese and Japanese peoples in the future. When Kobane Kenji, who was released in Taiyuan, spoke, he asked all the released Japanese to mourn the Chinese martyrs who died in the War of Resistance Against Japan. Many people cried on the spot, deeply expressing their apologies to the Chinese people.
