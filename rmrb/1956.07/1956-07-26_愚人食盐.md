    "The Fool Eating Salt"
    Fan Jun
    Although the "Hundred Parables Sutra" is a Buddhist scripture, it is also a profound and subtle literary work. The first parable, "The Parable of the Fool Eating Salt," says:
    Once upon a time, there was a fool who went to someone else's house. The host gave him food, but he complained that it was bland. Upon hearing this, the host added more salt. Finding it delicious with salt, he thought to himself, "It's delicious because of the salt. If a little is so good, how much better would more be?" The fool, lacking wisdom, then ate the salt by itself. After eating it, his mouth felt terrible, and it became a problem.
    This story, which satirizes those who blindly believe in a certain "magic weapon" without considering the specific circumstances, is a "parable," but it indeed paints a cartoon of certain phenomena in life. Even today, it still has great practical significance. Take meetings, for example. They are an indispensable part of getting work done; assigning tasks, mobilizing the masses, studying problems, summarizing experiences... often all require meetings to resolve. However, some people therefore believe that the more meetings, the better, and the longer the meetings, the better. They even think it's fine to hold the same meeting several times, or simply treat meetings as the sole content of their work, spending their days in one meeting after another without finding it strange; and they even force others to do the same. Another example is various statistics and reports, which are very useful for investigation and research and understanding the situation. Unfortunately, some people also think the more, the better. Thus, one horizontal, one vertical, one east, one west... leaving many grassroots cadres busy all day long turning around in numbers and tables. In fact, the fate of many of these repetitive and meaningless statistics and reports is only to be stored as archives first, and then destroyed as archives.
    The principle is originally very simple. Unfortunately, sometimes it is precisely the simplest principles that are misinterpreted, forgotten, or denied.
    Comparing these comrades to the "fool" who "ate the salt by itself" may not be entirely appropriate. Because they do this, most of them still want to do a good job. But it should also be admitted that the error of both lies in a blind faith in certain things. These comrades' blind faith in the omnipotence of meetings, statistics, and reports, what difference is there from the "fool's" blind faith in the deliciousness of salt? Moreover, the latter at most makes his own mouth feel bad for a while, while our comrades not only suffer themselves and harm others, but also mess up the work.
    The ancients said to "know when to stop," and also said "too much is as bad as too little." Only by breaking down blind faith, using our brains more, and considering in everything what is "enough," what is "too much," and what is "too little," can we truly avoid being this kind of harmful, useless "fool."

    “愚人食盐”
    樊骏
    “百喻经”虽是佛教的经书，但同样也是一部浑厚含蓄的文学作品。第一条“愚人食盐喻”中说：
    昔有愚人，至于他家。主人与食，嫌淡无味。主人闻已，更为益盐。既得盐美，便自念言：“所以美者，缘有盐故。少有尚尔，况复多也。”愚人无智，便空食盐。食已口爽，返为其患。
    这个讽刺一种人不问具体情况、片面地迷信某一“法宝”的故事，虽是一个“喻”，但它确实给生活中某些现象画下一幅漫画，就是在今天，也还有很大的现实意义。比如开会。这原是进行工作不可少的环节；布置任务、发动群众、研究问题、总结经验……往往都需要开会来解决。可是有些人却因此以为会开得越多越好、越长越好，甚至同一个内容的会重复开几次也好，或者干脆把开会当作自己工作的唯一内容，成天消磨在一个接一个的会议中也不以为怪；而且还要强迫别人都这样做。又比如各种统计、报表，对于调查研究、了解情况，都是很有用的。可惜有些人又因此觉得越多越好。于是，横一个、竖一个、东一个、西一个……让许多基层干部整天忙忙碌碌地在一些数字、表格中打转。这些事实上有很多是重复的、没有意义的统计、表报的命运，也只能是先当作档案存放，然后当作档案销毁而已。
    道理本来很简单。不幸的是，有时正是最简单的道理，会被曲解、被遗忘、被否认。
    把这些同志和“便空食盐”的“愚人”相比，或许不很妥当。因为他们这样做，大多还是想把工作搞好。但也应该承认，两者的错误都在于对某些事物产生了迷信。这些同志迷信开会、统计、表报的万能，和那个“愚人”迷信盐之美味，又有什么区别呢？而且，后者至多不过使自己嘴里一时不好受，而我们这些同志就不仅苦了自己、害了别人，还会把工作搞糟。
    古人说要“适可而止”，又说“过犹不及”。我们只有破除迷信，多动脑筋，凡事都考虑一下什么是“可”、什么是“过”和“不及”，才能真正不做这种害人害己、一无是处的“愚人”。
