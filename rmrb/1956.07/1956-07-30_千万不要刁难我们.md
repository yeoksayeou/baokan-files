    Don't Deliberately Make Things Difficult For Us

    Editor's Note: What attitude should leading personnel of factories and mines adopt towards the work of state supervisory organs? Is it a welcoming attitude, or a resistant one? This is a matter of principle. The supervisory organs of our country have the responsibility to supervise and inspect all state organs, organizations, and enterprises to safeguard the interests of the state and the people. The unreasonable obstruction of state supervisory personnel by the leading personnel of the sintering plant of Anshan Iron and Steel Company is a very wrong and dangerous behavior. This should serve as a warning to other enterprise managers.

    Comrades Editors:
    We are staff members of the Anshan Office of the State Bureau of Supervision of Heavy Industry. Please give us a little space in the newspaper to tell you about the difficulties we encounter in our work. We have no intention of demanding "privileges." Our greatest wish is simply to ask everyone to provide us with some convenience in our work. Why do we raise such a question? Because we encountered a very unpleasant matter, which often makes it difficult for us to forget.
    On June 25, we went to the sintering plant of Anshan Iron and Steel Company to understand the production situation. This factory has failed to complete the state plan month after month since the beginning of this year. By May, it had already underproduced 140,000 tons of sintered ore, seriously threatening the production of the iron smelting plant; the cost also exceeded the budget by 2.09 million yuan.
    We took the letter of introduction from the Anshan Office of the State Bureau of Supervision of Heavy Industry and went to the duty director's office of the sintering workshop first, intending to look at the production daily reports for the recent period to see if we could find any problems; we usually do this in the factory. Fu Yingchen, the recording clerk in charge of statistics, told us: "There are regulations from above stating that viewing such materials requires approval from the Confidentiality Committee." We thought that since there were such regulations, the supervisory personnel should abide by them, so we went to the Confidentiality Committee. Li Guiru, the confidentiality officer of the Confidentiality Committee, said, "This requires the approval of the factory director." So we went to the factory director's office.
    Sitting in the factory director's office was a comrade in his thirties, of short stature and with a thin face. This was Sun Zhongping, the factory director's secretary. He was already an old acquaintance of ours. Last fourth quarter, when we, together with the Anshan Municipal Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, inspected the implementation of the factory's production increase plan, and again in April and May of this year when we inspected the factory's completion of production, we had had many dealings with him. As soon as we entered, we first greeted him: "Secretary Sun, are you busy? We want to understand the production situation of your factory and also want to see the production daily reports." Secretary Sun picked up the letter of introduction, pondered for a long time without saying a word, then picked up a pen and wrote a few large characters: "Contact the Education Section." We felt strange. In the past, borrowing materials had never been done through the Education Section, and we had never encountered the need to borrow production daily reports through the Education Section in other factories and mines. So we asked, "To understand the production situation, why go to the Education Section?" At this time, Secretary Sun waved his hand impatiently and said, "Go, there's nothing wrong."
    Although this matter surprised us, we were accustomed to this kind of attitude. People engaged in our work have already received "impatient" treatment in many places. As long as we can complete the task, we have long stopped taking this to heart. Since Secretary Sun said there was nothing wrong, it probably wasn't wrong. So we ran to the Education Section. Comrade Gao Dechang of the Education Section read Secretary Sun's instructions, immediately exchanged the factory's letter of introduction for us, and then introduced us to the Safety Technology Section. This made us even more puzzled: "Why do you want us to go to the Safety Technology Section? Could it be that there are new regulations in the factory?"
    Entering the Safety Technology Section, a comrade in the section read the letter of introduction and immediately said to us: "...Near the reduction roasting furnace, do not look inside towards the fire opening. There are many machines in the ore dressing workshop, be careful when walking. The belts in the sintering workshop are very messy, do not cross the belts to avoid danger..." From raw materials to finished products, he lectured on safety knowledge for a full twenty minutes. After finishing the lecture, this comrade wrote "Preliminary safety technology education has been conducted" on the letter of introduction and sent us out of the room.
    At this time, we didn't know whether to laugh or cry. What kind of medicine were these people selling in their gourds? The sintering plant was built on a hilltop. This hilltop faces south and points north, looking like a locomotive standing on flat ground. We ran from the duty director's office of the sintering workshop on the western hillside to the Confidentiality Committee, the factory director's office, and the Education Section on the top of the hill, and then to the Safety Technology Section, which was located at the foot of the hill. We ran to five places up and down the hill, and our backs ached from exhaustion. Moreover, where should we go now?
    After discussing it, everyone felt that all the procedures had been completed, so we should still go to the sintering workshop. We crossed the hill again and found Comrade Fu Yingchen, the recorder of the sintering workshop. He picked up the letter of introduction and was greatly surprised: "Why did they exchange it for a letter of introduction for interns? And it only says to understand the production process and focus on familiarizing oneself with the sintering workshop, and it doesn't say anything about being able to see the production daily reports!" At this time, we suddenly realized that Secretary Sun was playing tricks on us.
    To be honest, we were very angry at the time, so we climbed back to the top of the hill despite our fatigue and found Secretary Sun again. When Secretary Sun heard our accusations, his eyes kept rolling, and he stammered: "...These are the most confidential materials in the factory, and no one except the factory director is allowed to see them!" He didn't mention a word about treating us as "interns." After negotiation, he reluctantly wrote a few words on the letter of introduction: "May refer to the production daily reports, but not allowed to copy." At this time, the sun was already high in the sky, it was time for lunch break, and we had to return to the office, having gained nothing all morning.
    When we returned to the office, we checked the documents to see if supervisory personnel could see the production daily reports, to avoid misremembering. We found the "Simplified Rules of Organization of the State Bureau of Supervision of Heavy Industry" jointly promulgated by the Ministry of Supervision and the former Ministry of Heavy Industry on March 27 of this year, in which the authority of the Bureau of Supervision is clearly stipulated: "The Bureau of Supervision may, according to work needs, consult and obtain all documents, plans, reports, forms, and accounting statistics and other materials from relevant units." This means that it is not illegal for us to want to see the daily report forms.
    On the morning of the 29th, we reopened the letter of introduction from the office of the Bureau of Supervision and went to the factory's Confidentiality Committee to negotiate. Comrade Li Guiru still received us, and she still wanted us to find the factory director's office for approval. For the sake of work, let's make another trip! Secretary Sun looked embarrassed when he saw us coming again, and we also wanted to copy the production daily reports. After thinking for a while, he wrote on the letter of introduction: "Contact the Confidentiality Committee." It looked like we were going to have to do the same thing as the other day. What can we do? We had to make a few more trips! When Li Guiru of the Confidentiality Committee saw us coming again, she was also puzzled, so she turned and walked into the factory director's office. After a while, she came back and wrote on the letter of introduction: "Contact the Education Section." We were really scared. If we went to receive safety education again, wouldn't this day be wasted again! Therefore, we explained to her: "We came the day before yesterday, we have already been to the Education Section, and we have also received some safety education. We want to abide by the confidentiality system, but you shouldn't make us run around everywhere without solving the problem!" When she heard this, she felt it made sense and said, "I'll go inquire again..."
    Before Li Guiru finished speaking, we suddenly heard a roar from behind the screen: "The three-level safety technology education system is the company's regulation, and everyone must abide by it!" We went in to take a look and saw a middle-aged, thin man sitting in a leather chair, glaring with anger. We didn't know what the reason was that aroused such great anger from this comrade, so we stepped forward to explain: "We are not not abiding by the system, we..." Before we could finish our first sentence, the comrade said sternly, "Since you are abiding by the system, what are you shouting about, what are you shouting about!" Who is this? With such great power. So we asked, "What is your name?"
    "My surname is Liu."
    "This is our Deputy Factory Director Liu Guangyi." Someone interjected.
    "You are from which unit?" Deputy Factory Director Liu asked again:
    "Anshan Office of the State Bureau of Supervision of Heavy Industry."
    "Ah! The Bureau of Supervision, what's so great about the Bureau of Supervision! Come! Bring the proof and let me see it!"
    Although Deputy Factory Director Liu's tone contained great hostility and contempt, which was unbearable, we still handed him the letter of introduction. Who would have thought that he would pick up the letter of introduction without even looking at it, but suddenly stood up and ordered us with a livid face: "Sit down, I'll examine you!" This arrogant attitude made us unable to hold back our anger, so we retorted him: "You have no right to examine us." After speaking, we wanted to take the letter of introduction to find the factory's Party Secretary. At this moment, Deputy Factory Director Liu snatched the letter of introduction and ordered again: "Sit down! I am the factory director of this factory, I am the state representative, I am the director of the Confidentiality Committee, I have the right to examine you!"
    The few of us could not resist this deputy factory director who had lost his normal state, so we simply sat on the sofa to see how he would examine us.
    "Why are you angry?" Deputy Factory Director Liu asked.
    "Our attitude was not good, it was wrong, but why are you angry without understanding the situation?"
    "I won't talk to you about these things, I'll talk to your leader."
    "That's good, his phone number is 5882."
    "Are you Director Cao?" Deputy Factory Director Liu asked into the phone: "The two comrades who came here have a very bad attitude, what is your opinion?"
    "You are Old Liu, if they have any shortcomings in their work, you can give them some suggestions. As for the purpose of their visit is to help you with your work, so I still need you to assist more." Director Cao replied.
    It seemed that Deputy Factory Director Liu originally wanted to let us see "Hey, I don't talk to you little cadres, I can directly find your leader," in order to show his power and also scare us. But it seemed that this time it was not successful either. After he hung up the phone, he carefully looked at the letter of introduction, and a embarrassed expression replaced his anger. He sat there blankly and remained silent.
    "Deputy Factory Director Liu, what is the result of the examination of us?" We asked.
    "There there, I didn't want to examine you, I just wanted to see the letter of introduction," Deputy Factory Director Liu replied.
    "Then do you see any problems with the letter of introduction?"
    "It's in accordance with the procedures, it's in accordance with the procedures."
    Seeing that Deputy Factory Director Liu had regained his sanity, we stopped pursuing the results of the examination. We just reported to him what we had encountered the day before and today.
    "Yes, most of us here are new cadres, we don't understand the situation, and I didn't know that such a thing happened the day before yesterday." After speaking, he picked up a pen and crossed out all the instructions on the letter of introduction and rewrote: "Allowed to copy the production daily reports." In this way, we finally saw the production daily reports! How difficult!
    With the help of many comrades, we finally completed this inspection task. However, we cannot forget the things mentioned earlier for a long time. Whenever we think of this matter, we are always very happy, because in our country, wrong thoughts and behaviors will never succeed. However, for the sake of our own work, a strong desire has also grown: I hope that in future work, we will no longer encounter people like Deputy Factory Director Liu and Secretary Sun, and we earnestly request the leading personnel of various enterprises to provide us with convenience in our work instead of deliberately making things difficult.
    Finally, there is still a question that we always can't figure out: Why did Deputy Factory Director Liu and Secretary Sun deliberately make things difficult for us supervisory personnel in every possible way? Only they themselves know this. It would be best if they could publicly answer in the newspaper.

### 千万不要刁难我们

    千万不要刁难我们
    编者按：厂矿企业领导人员应该以什么态度对待国家监察机关的工作。是欢迎的态度呢，还是抗拒的态度？这是一个原则性的问题。我们国家的监察机关负有对一切国家机关、团体、企业进行监督和检查的责任，以维护国家和人民的利益。鞍山钢铁公司烧结总厂的领导人员对国家监察机关工作人员无理刁难，是十分错误和危险的行为。这一点，值得其它企业管理人员引起警惕。编辑同志：
    我们是重工业国家监察局鞍山办事处的工作人员。请你们在报纸上给一点点位置，让我们诉说一下在工作中遇到的困难。我们毫没有要求“特权”的意思，最大的愿望不过是祈求大家能给我们一些工作上的方便。为什么提出这样的问题呢？因为我们遇到一件很不愉快的事，这件事常常使我们难以忘却。
    六月二十五日，我们到鞍山钢铁公司烧结总厂去了解生产情况。这个厂今年以来月月完不成国家计划，到五月份已经欠产十四万吨烧结矿，严重地威胁着炼铁厂的生产；成本也超支了二百零九万元。
    我们拿着重工业国家监察局鞍山办事处的介绍信，先到烧结车间值班主任室，打算看一下近一个时期的生产日报，看是不是能发现一些问题；在工厂里我们通常都是这样做的。负责统计的记录员傅英琛同志告诉我们：“上级有规定，看这种资料要经保密委员会批准。”我们想，既然有这样的规定，监察人员应该遵守，于是就去保密委员会了。保密委员会的保密干事李桂儒说：“这要厂长批准。”我们又到厂长室去。
    厂长室里坐着一位三十岁左右的同志，矮小个子，瘦瘦的脸，这就是厂长的秘书孙中平。他已经是我们的老熟人了。去年第四季度，我们同中共鞍山市委一起检查这个厂增产计划的执行情况的时候、今年四、五月间检查这个厂产量完成情况的时候，都同他打过不少交道。一进门，我们首先招呼：“孙秘书忙吧？我们想了解一下你们厂的生产情况，还想看看生产日报。”孙秘书拿起介绍信，沉思良久，一言不发，接着拿起笔来一挥，批上了几个大字：“教育科接洽”。我们觉得奇怪，过去借阅资料从来没有通过教育科，在其他厂矿也没有遇见过要通过教育科借阅生产日报的事情。于是我们就问：“了解生产情况，怎么要到教育科去呢？”这时，孙秘书很不耐烦地挥一下手说：“去吧，没有错。”
    这件事虽然令我们诧异，对这种态度我们却习以为常了。像从事我们这个工作的人，已经在不少地方受到“不耐烦”的待遇。只要能完成任务，我们早就不把这放在心上了。既然孙秘书说没有错，大概是不会错的。我们就跑到教育科。教育科的高德昌同志看完了孙秘书的批语，立即给我们换了厂内的介绍信，接着把我们介绍到安全技术科去。这更使我们纳闷：“为什么要咱们去安全技术科呢？莫不是厂里有了新的规定？”
    走进了安全技术科，科内的一个同志看完介绍信，马上对我们说：“……在还原焙烧炉旁，不要对着火口往里望。选矿车间机器多，走路要小心。烧结车间的皮带很乱，不要横跨皮带，以免发生危险……”从原料到成品，足足讲了二十来分钟的安全常识。讲完以后，这个同志就在介绍信上批上“已进行过初步安全技术教育”，把我们送出了屋门。
    这时，我们啼笑皆非，这些人的葫芦里究竟装的是什么药呢？烧结总厂建立在一座山头上。这座山头面朝南、尾朝北，活像平地上站着一个火车头。我们从西面半山腰上的烧结车间值班主任室跑到山顶上的保密委员会、厂长室、教育科，又到了在山下办公的安全技术科。山上山下，跑了五个地方，累得腰酸背疼。而且，现在到什么地方去呢？
    大家商量了一下，觉得所有的手续都办了，还是去烧结车间。我们再翻过山头，找到了烧结车间记录员傅英琛同志，他拿起介绍信一看，大为惊讶：“怎么给你们换了实习生的介绍信呢？而这上面只写着了解生产过程、重点熟悉烧结车间，并没有说能看生产日报啊！”这时我们才恍然大悟，原来孙秘书在捉弄我们。
    老实说，我们当时很气愤，便不顾疲劳爬上山顶，又找到了孙秘书。孙秘书听到我们的责问，一双眼珠骨碌碌地转个不停，结结巴巴地说：“……这是厂里最绝密的资料，除了厂长谁也不准看哪！”关于把我们当“实习生”的事只字未提。经过交涉，他无可奈何地在介绍信上批了几个字：“可参阅生产日报，但不准抄录”。这时，太阳已经升在当空，该是午休的时候了，我们不得不返回机关，整个上午一无所获。
    我们回到机关查了查文件，看看监察人员能否看生产日报，免得记错了。我们找到了今年三月二十七日监察部和原重工业部联合颁布的“重工业国家监察局组织简则”中关于监察局的权限一条，上面规定得很清楚：“监察局根据工作需要，可以向有关单位调阅和索取各项文件、计划、报告、表报和会计统计等一切资料。”这就是说我们要看日报表并不是违法的。
    二十九日上午，我们又重新开了监察局办事处的介绍信，去找厂的保密委员会交涉。接待我们的还是那位李桂儒同志，她仍要我们找厂长室批办。为了工作，再跑一趟吧！孙秘书一看我们这几个人又来了，而且还要抄录生产日报，便面露尴尬之色，考虑了一会，在介绍信上批了个：“保密委员会接洽”。看样子，我们又要像前几天一样了。有什么法子呢，只好再多跑几趟吧！保密委员会李桂儒一看我们又来了，她也很纳闷，就转身走进了厂长室，一会儿她回来了，随手在介绍信上批了：“教育科接洽”。我们真有些害怕了，如果再去受安全教育，这一天不又是白白过去了吗！因此就向她解释：前天我们来过，已经去过教育科，还受了一番安全教育，保密制度我们要遵守，可是你们不应该要我们到处跑而不解决问题啊！”她一听觉得有道理，说：“我再去打听……”
    李桂儒的话还未说完，忽听得屏风背后一声吼叫：“三级安全技术教育制度是公司的规定，谁都得遵守！”我们进去一瞧，只见一个中年的瘦个子落坐在皮圈椅上，圆瞪着眼，怒气冲冲。我们不知道是什么缘故竟然惹起了这位同志那么大的怒火，便上前解释：“我们不是不遵守制度，我们……”没等我们说完第一句话，那位同志就声色俱厉地说：“你们既然遵守制度，嚷什么，嚷什么！”这是谁呢？那么大的威风。我们就问：“你贵姓？”
      “我姓刘。”
      “这是我们的刘光毅副厂长。”有人插了一句。
      “你们是那个单位？”刘副厂长又问：
    “重工业国家监察局鞍山办事处。”
    “啊！监察局的，监察局有什么了不起的！来！把证明拿来看看！”
    虽然刘副厂长的语气里包含着极大的敌意和轻蔑，使人难以忍受，我们还是把介绍信递给了他。谁想到，他拿起介绍信看也不看，却霍地站起来，铁青着脸命令我们：“坐下来，我审查审查你们！”他这种狂妄的态度，使我们再也压不住火了，也就顶撞了他一下：“你没有权力来审查我们。”说完想拿起介绍信去找厂的党委书记。就在这时，刘副厂长劈手抢去介绍信，再次命令：“坐下！我是这个厂的厂长，是国家代表，是保密委员会主任，我有权审查你们！”
    我们这几个人是拗不过这位已经失掉常态的副厂长的，索性坐在沙发上，看他怎样审查。
      “你们为什么要发脾气？”刘副厂长问。
      “我们的态度有些不好，是不对，而你为什么不了解情况就发脾气呢？”
      “我不和你们谈这些，我找你们领导谈。”
    “那也好，他的电话是5882。”
      “你是曹主任吗？”刘副厂长拿起电话问道：“你们来的两个同志在这里态度很不好，你的意见怎么样？”
    “你是老刘同志嘛，假使他们工作中有什么缺点，你可以向他们提提意见。至于他们来的目的是在于帮助你们工作，所以还要你多多协助。”曹主任这样回答。
    看样子，刘副厂长原想让我们看一看“嘿，我不和你们这些小干部谈什么，可以直接找你们领导”，以此来显示自己的威风，同时也吓唬吓唬我们。可是看来，这一下也并没有成功。他挂完电话，将介绍信仔细端详了一番，脸色上靦觍神情代替了怒气，他呆呆地坐在那里默不作声了。
      “刘副厂长，对我们审查结果怎么样？”我们问。
      “那里那里，我并不是要审查你们，我只是想看下介绍信。”刘副厂长回答道。
      “那你看介绍信有什么问题吗？”
      “合乎手续，合乎手续。”
    我们见到刘副厂长既然已经恢复了理智，也就不再追查审查的结果了。只是把前天和今天遇到的事情向他汇报了一遍。
      “是啊，我们这里大都是新干部，不了解情况，我也不知道前天有过这样的事情”。说完，提笔把介绍信上所有的批语全部划去，改写上：“准抄录生产日报”。这样，我们总算看到了生产日报了！多么困难啊！
    在许多同志的帮助下，我们终于完成了这次的检查任务。但是，对于前面所提到的事情久久不能忘却。每想到这件事，我们总是很高兴，因为在我们国家里，错误思想和行为总是无法得逞的。可是，为我们自己的工作着想，也滋长了一种强烈的愿望：但愿在今后的工作中，不再碰到像刘副厂长、孙秘书这样的人，恳求各企业的领导人员能给我们工作以方便而不是刁难。
    最后，我们还有一个问题总是想不通：刘副厂长、孙秘书为什么对我们监察人员百般刁难呢？这只有他们自己知道，如果他们能在报纸上公开答复，是最好不过了。
