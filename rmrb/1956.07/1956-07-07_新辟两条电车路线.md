    Two New Trolleybus Routes Opened
    (Our newspaper's dispatch) Beijing has newly opened two trolleybus routes – from Xizhimen to the Gymnasium and from Xizhimen to Chongwenmen. These two routes will officially open to traffic on the 10th. After the direct trolleybus from Xizhimen to the Gymnasium opens, spectators going to the Gymnasium to watch various exciting ball games will no longer have to worry about inconvenient transportation; at the same time, it will also solve the urgent need for public transportation for residents in the southeastern part of the outer city.
    Beijing has had trolleybuses since 1924. In the twenty-five years up to 1949, development was very slow. By the time of liberation, only four routes were open to traffic, with a total operating route length of more than thirty kilometers. In the seven years since liberation, Beijing's trolleybuses have experienced rapid development. Now there are nine long-distance routes, with a total operating route length of eighty-four kilometers, more than one and a half times greater than in the past. There are 217 trolleybuses running daily, reaching 227 on holidays, more than ten times more than before liberation. The average daily passenger volume reaches 330,000, more than three and a half times greater than the highest passenger volume before liberation.
    In order to meet the needs of the capital's construction, the first trackless trolleybus route has begun construction and is expected to open to traffic in the spring of next year. (Zhang Zhipeng)

    新辟两条电车路线
    本报讯　北京市又新增辟两条电车路线——西直门到体育馆和西直门到崇文门。这两条路线，将在十日正式通车。西直门到体育馆的直达电车通车后，前往体育馆参观各种精彩球赛的观众，再也不用因交通不便而发愁了；同时也解决了外城东南隅一带居民迫切需要公共交通工具的问题。
    北京市从1924年开始有电车、到1949年的二十五年时间内，发展很少，到解放时，只有四条路线能通车，营业路线的长度三十多公里。在解放以后的七年时间内，北京市的电车有了飞跃的发展，到现在已有九条长距离的路线、营业路线总长度达八十四公里，比过去增加了一倍半。每日行驶的电车有217辆，假日时达到227辆，比解放前夕增加十几倍。平均每日客运量达三十三万人，比解放前最高客运量增加三倍半以上。
    为了适应首都建设的需要，第一条无轨电车路线已开始修建，明年春即可通车。　（张志鹏）
