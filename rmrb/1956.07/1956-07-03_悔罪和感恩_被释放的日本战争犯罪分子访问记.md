Repentance and Gratitude
    ——A Visit with Released Japanese War Criminals
    By our staff reporter Li Gao

    The blue train passed Shanhaiguan. This was a special train arranged by the Red Cross Society of China to transport 295 newly released Japanese war criminals from Fushun to Tianjin.

    In one of the carriages, a Japanese man was staring out the window in a daze, tears welling up in his eyes. Reporters asked him why he was sad.

    "Yes, I am thinking about something." He stood up and bowed, tears streaming down his face. "My name is Shimazu Yujiro. During the war, I was a military policeman stationed at a mountain pass north of Shanhaiguan, and I did many bad things. Once, I broke into a house and killed a newly married couple. Now, I, a criminal, have been given lenient treatment by the Chinese people and am about to return home to be reunited with my mother and younger brother. However, the people I killed can never come back to life. When I saw the hills near Shanhaiguan and the peaceful life along the way, the more I thought about it, the sadder I became."

    Shimazu Yujiro was not the only one on this train with such feelings. During the day and night journey, many people in each carriage were lost in thought or discussing their feelings. When they spoke with the Chinese reporters, they either wept while confessing their crimes or repeatedly expressed their gratitude to the Chinese people for pardoning them. Uname Hikosaburo had been a police officer and police chief in Northeast China for more than ten years, torturing and killing many Chinese people. He said, "For the crimes I committed in the past, I could have been sentenced to death, but the Chinese people pardoned me. When I heard the decision to exempt me from prosecution, I was extremely grateful." As he spoke, he began to cry.

    The fact that a group of people who had actively participated in the war of aggression and committed serious crimes against the Chinese people can have some repentance today is the result of a long process.

    I visited the Fushun War Criminals Management Center, where more than 900 Japanese war criminals were originally detained (including Suzuki Keihisa and the other eight who were recently publicly tried and sentenced, and the first group of 295 who were exempted from prosecution). Among them were high-ranking officers who had commanded the Japanese invading forces and committed various serious crimes in violation of international law and humanitarian principles; there were lower-ranking officers and soldiers who directly engaged in murder, arson, rape, and looting; there were also high-ranking Japanese officials who manipulated the puppet government of Manchukuo and enslaved our people; and there were also military police, police officers, and secret agents who committed all kinds of evil deeds. The case files accumulated by our procuratorial organs over the years in investigating their criminal acts filled several rooms.

    When most of them were first detained, they tried to conceal their bloody hands, claiming to be "innocent people." Some still clung to militaristic ideas, fantasizing about a future comeback. On the other hand, they were all afraid of being severely punished. Suzuki Keihisa, who had committed serious crimes, said, "If the Chinese people treated me the way I used to treat the Chinese, I wouldn't be able to live for a day."

    However, the Chinese government, while seriously investigating their crimes, treated them in accordance with humanitarian principles.

    The old site of the Fushun War Criminals Management Center was originally a prison used by Japanese invaders to persecute Chinese patriots. A Japanese war criminal who had served as the warden of that prison is now detained here. When I visited him, he pointed to the buildings outside the window and talked about the contrast between this place as a prison for Japanese invaders in the past and as a war criminal management center of the Chinese government now:—The prison cells in the past were filthy and stinky, with a layer of ice on the walls in winter and full of flies and mosquitoes in summer; now they are equipped with heating, screens, and are regularly disinfected, so there are no mosquitoes or flies. The current heating boiler room and bakery were originally factories where Japanese invaders forced Chinese patriots to do hard labor. The current sports field is where Chinese patriots were forced to grow vegetables and raise pigs in the past. A dark room where Chinese patriots were tortured in the past has now become the pharmacy of the clinic for treating war criminals. The bathrooms now used by war criminals used to be warehouses for Japanese invaders... He also mentioned that in the past, Japanese invaders only gave so-called "prisoners" a small bowl of sorghum rice per meal, forced them to do hard labor from dawn to dusk, and many people were tortured and beaten to death. He himself had beaten people to death here. Now, the Chinese authorities managing war criminals ensure the prisoners' lives and health, do not beat or scold them, and do not insult their dignity.

    The reporter asked him what he thought of these changes. He said, "I think the Chinese people give us such humanitarian treatment out of lofty human love. China is now building a society that brings happiness to all mankind, a society of peace, mutual assistance, and the pursuit of a better life. Therefore, even for people like us who have committed crimes like ghosts, we are treated as human beings, allowed to walk on the right path, no longer commit crimes, and start anew."

    However, in the beginning, those Japanese war criminals who only knew how to do bad things found it difficult to understand the humanitarian treatment given to them by the Chinese people. For example, when the war criminal management center was building a heating boiler room, some people thought it was building a "killing room"; when a clinic was being built, some people were afraid that they would be "used as materials for germ warfare experiments," and therefore experienced a period of groundless fear. Ishida Denjiro, a former Japanese military police lieutenant, told reporters, "Here, the facts are always the opposite of what I thought, which made me realize that the path I had taken for the past forty years was wrong."

    It was under the influence of this humanitarian treatment by the Chinese people that many Japanese war criminals began to repent. The reporter visited many of them, and every one of them began by expressing their gratitude for the humanitarian treatment they had received from the Chinese people. Sano Kazuo, who was released this time, originally refused to admit his crimes. Later, he suffered from rectal cancer and anal stenosis. His condition was critical, and the management authorities sent him to the hospital, where he underwent two operations and had an artificial anus made, which saved his life. After recovering and being discharged from the hospital, he wrote a handwritten confession, admitting his past crimes of torturing and killing Chinese people, and described in detail how Chinese doctors and nurses treated him, expressing his repentance. When this handwritten confession was read aloud in public, the prisoners who heard it wept along with him.

    The changes in the international situation in recent years have also been an important factor in prompting many Japanese war criminals to bow their heads and confess their crimes. The Korean War had the greatest impact. At first, most of the detained Japanese war criminals thought that the Korean people and the Chinese People's Volunteers could not defeat the American aggressors. Some even fantasized that the Americans would invade and release them. However, the outcome of the Korean War was completely contrary to what these people had expected, which made many originally stubborn people see the growth of the Chinese people's strength and had no choice but to abandon the "Bushido" spirit and bow their heads to confess their crimes. Regarding the situation in Japan, some Japanese war criminals initially did not quite believe what they saw in the newspapers, but from 1954 onwards, they successively received letters from home, only to learn that some of their relatives had been killed by atomic bombs in Hiroshima, and that some of their relatives were living a life of humiliation near American military bases. This made many people realize that the war of aggression they had participated in not only brought great harm to the Chinese people, but also caused unprecedented disasters to Japan, and therefore confessed their crimes and expressed regret.

    During their detention, the War Criminals Management Center also educated them about opposing war and safeguarding peace, and gave them various opportunities for learning. They purchased more than 2,300 books for them, subscribed to some newspapers and magazines in both Chinese and Japanese, purchased some musical instruments, and regularly screened movies. In the learning and active cultural life, some people gradually distinguished right from wrong and reflected on their sins and repented. Some of them even went from being illiterate to being able to read and write, and many learned to sing, compose, dance, or play musical instruments. They formed a band of more than 30 people and a choir of more than 70 people, and regularly held cultural evenings. On this trip from Fushun to Tianjin, whenever the train stopped for a slightly longer time, they would gather on the platform and sing songs of defending peace in unison.

    This group of minor Japanese war criminals who showed repentance and performed well finally received lenient treatment from the Chinese people. On June 21, when they heard the Supreme People's Procuratorate of our country announce the decision to exempt them from prosecution, many were moved to tears and all raised their hands to request to speak. Eight people in a row expressed their feelings. Miyazaki Toshio said with sobs, "I used to be an electrician in a mine. Later, I put down my hammer, picked up a gun, and participated in the war of aggression. I killed Chinese people like my father, insulted kind women like my mother, and killed babies who were breastfeeding in their mothers' arms. These crimes cannot be forgiven. However, the Chinese people have pardoned me and taught me how to be a human being. In the future, I will answer the kindness of the Chinese people by opposing war, safeguarding peace, and returning to the ranks of the working people."

    悔罪和感恩
    ——被释放的日本战争犯罪分子访问记
    本报记者　李高
    蓝色的列车驶过了山海关。这是中国红十字会从抚顺接运295名刚被释放的日本战争犯罪分子前往天津的专车。
    在一节车厢里，有一个日本人噙着眼泪在对着窗外出神。记者们问他为什么难过。
    “是的，我正在想心事。”他躬身站起，眼泪夺眶而出。“我叫岛津酉二良、战时当宪兵，在山海关北面的一个山隘口驻扎过，做过许多坏事。有一次，我闯进人家，把一对新婚夫妇杀死了。现在，我这犯罪的人得到了中国人民的宽大处理，就要回国和我的母亲、弟弟团聚了，可是，被我杀害了的人再也活不转来了。当我看到山海关附近的山岗，看到沿途的和平生活景象的时候，我越想越难过。”
    在这列火车上，岛津酉二良并不是唯一的有这种感触的人。在一天一夜的旅途中，每一节车厢里都有许多人在沉思默想或者谈论他们的感触。他们在同中国记者们交谈的时候，不是流着眼泪忏悔自己的罪行，就是再三再四地对中国人民宽赦他们表示感激。宇波彦次郎曾在我国东北做过十多年警官和警察局长，拷打、杀害过许多中国人民。他说：“像我过去所犯的罪行，是可以被判处死刑的，但是中国人民宽赦了我。当听到免予起诉决定书的时候，我感激到了极点。”谈着谈着他就哭起来了。
    这样一批曾经积极参加侵略战争，对中国人民犯下严重罪行的人，今天能够有所悔悟，是经历了很长的过程的。
    我访问过抚顺战犯管理所，那里原来关押着九百多名日本战争犯罪分子（包括最近公审判刑的铃木启久等八人和第一批免予起诉的295人在内）。其中有曾经指挥日本侵略军队，犯下各种违反国际公法和人道原则的严重罪行的高级军官；有直接进行杀人、放火、强奸、抢劫的下级军官和士兵；有操纵伪满傀儡政府、奴役我国人民的日本高级官吏；也有无恶不作的宪兵、警察和特务分子。我国检察机关几年来在侦讯他们的犯罪行为中所积累的案卷，堆满了几间屋子。
    大多数人在刚被关押的时候，曾经想要掩藏自己的血手，自称为“无罪的人”，有的人还抱着军国主义思想，幻想将来东山再起。另一方面，他们又全都害怕受到严厉的惩罚。罪行严重的铃木启久说：“如果中国人民像我过去对待中国人那样对待我，那我一天也活不了。”
    可是，我国政府一面严肃地侦查他们的罪行，同时又以人道主义的原则对待他们。
    抚顺战犯管理所的旧址，原是日本侵略者残害中国爱国志士的一所监狱。做过那个监狱的典狱长的一个日本战争犯罪分子，现在就关押在这里。我访问他的时候，他指点着窗外的房屋，谈起这里过去作为日本侵略者的监狱和现在作为中国政府的战犯管理所的前后对比：——过去的监号里又臭又脏，冬天墙上冻一层冰，夏天充满苍蝇蚊子；现在安了暖气，装了纱窗，还定期消毒，见不到蚊蝇。现在的暖气锅炉房和面包房，原来是日本侵略者强迫中国爱国志士做苦工的工厂。现在的运动场，是过去强迫中国爱国志士种菜、养猪的地方。过去一所折磨中国爱国志士的暗室，现在变成了为战犯们治病的医务所的药房。现在战犯们用的浴室，过去是日本侵略者的仓库……他还谈到：过去日本侵略者在这里只给所谓“犯人”每餐一小碗高粮米饭，强迫他们从天亮到天黑做苦工，许多人被虐待和拷打致死，他自己就在这里打死过人。而现在，中国管理战犯当局保障犯人的生活和健康，不打不骂，不侮辱犯人的人格。
    记者问他对这些有什么感想。他说：“我想，中国人民给予我们以这样的人道主义待遇，是出于崇高的人类爱。现在中国正在建设给全人类带来幸福的、和平的、互相帮助的、谋求更美好的生活的社会，所以对我们这样过去犯了像鬼一样的罪行的人，也当做人看待，让我们走正当的道路，不再犯罪，从新做人。”
    可是，在最初的时候，那些从前只知道做坏事的日本战争犯罪分子，对于中国人民给予他们人道主义的待遇是很难理解的。例如，战犯管理所修暖气锅炉房的时候，有的人曾以为是在盖“杀人房”；修医务所的时候，有的人就害怕拿他们“做细菌战试验材料”，因而曾经无端恐惧过一阵。前日本宪兵少尉石田传郎对记者说：“在这里，事实总是和我所想的相反，这才使我悔悟到，过去四十年的道路是走错了。”
    就在中国人民这种人道主义待遇的感化之下，许多日本战争犯罪分子开始悔罪了。记者访问过他们中的许多人，每一个人一开口总先要对中国人民对他们的人道待遇表示感激。这次被释放的佐野一，本来不肯承认自己的罪行。后来他患了直肠癌，肛门狭窄，病情危急，管理当局把他送到医院，动了两次手术，做了人工肛门，才把他挽救过来。病愈出院之后，他写了一篇手记，供认了自己过去拷打、杀害中国人民的罪行，并且详细描写了中国的医生、护士为他治病的经过，表示悔罪。这篇手记当众诵读的时候，听到的犯人都和他一道流泪。
    几年来国际形势的变化，也是促使许多日本战争犯罪分子低头认罪的一个重要因素。影响最大的是朝鲜战争。起初，大多数在押的日本战争犯罪分子都以为朝鲜人民和中国人民志愿军是敌不过美国侵略者的，有的人还幻想美国人会打进来，释放他们。可是，朝鲜战争的结果完全和这些人所料想的相反，使得许多本来很顽固的人也看到了中国人民力量的壮大，不得不丢弃“武士道”精神，低下头来认罪。关于日本国内的许多情况，有些日本战争犯罪分子起初看到报上所说的还不大相信，但从1954年开始，他们陆续收到家信，才知道有的人的亲属已在广岛被原子弹炸死，有的人的亲属在美国军事基地附近过着屈辱的生活。这就使许多人醒悟过来：自己所参加的侵略战争，不但给中国人民带来了重大的损害，而且使日本也遭受了空前的灾难，因而供认罪行，表示悔恨。
    在管押期间，战犯管理所还对他们进行了反对战争维护和平的教育，并给他们以各种学习的机会，为他们购置了二千三百多册图书，订了中日两国的一些报纸和杂志，购置了一部分乐器，并经常放映电影。在学习和活跃的文化生活中，有些人也逐渐辨别了是非，思过悔罪。其中还有一些人由文盲变成了能读能写，许多人学会了唱歌、作曲、舞蹈或演奏乐器。他们组成了一个三十多人的乐队和七十多人的合唱队，经常举行文艺晚会。在这次从抚顺到天津的路上，每当火车停得稍久的时候，他们就拥在月台上、齐声高唱着保卫和平的歌曲。
    这一批次要的和悔罪表现较好的日本战争犯罪分子，终于获得了中国人民的宽大处理。六月二十一日，他们听到我国最高人民检察院宣布免予起诉决定书的时候，许多人都感激涕零，全体举手要求发言，一连有八个人发表了感想。其中的宫崎敏夫泣不成声地说：“我过去在矿山当电工，后来放下锤子，拿起枪杆，参加侵略战争，杀害过像我父亲那样的中国人民，污辱过像我母亲那样善良的妇女，杀死过在母亲怀里吃奶的婴孩。这种罪行是不能饶恕的。但是，中国人民宽赦了我，还教育我怎样做人。我今后要以反对战争、维护和平，回到劳动人民队伍中去，来回答中国人民的恩情。”
