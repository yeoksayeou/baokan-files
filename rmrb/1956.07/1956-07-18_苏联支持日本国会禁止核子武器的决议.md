Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, July 17th: The Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, in a statement, expressed its full support for the resolution passed by the Japanese Diet in February of this year concerning the prohibition of nuclear weapons and the cessation of testing of such weapons.

The statement expressed the hope that the unified stance of the Soviet Union and Japan on this noble cause would also receive the active support of the parliaments of other countries.

The statement, passed by the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union on the 16th, said, "The Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union fully understands the particular concern expressed by the Japanese people regarding the continued expansion of armaments and the continuous testing of atomic and hydrogen weapons."

"The Soviet Union believes that only by completely prohibiting atomic and hydrogen weapons, that is, stopping their production, banning their use, destroying their stockpiles, and eliminating them from the armaments of all countries, can the people of all countries in the world be freed from the threat of a devastating atomic war and the serious consequences brought to mankind by the use of such weapons."

"Precisely for this reason, the Soviet Union has consistently strived for the complete prohibition of atomic weapons and the elimination of such weapons from the armaments of all countries in the post-war years, and has submitted corresponding proposals to the United Nations on more than one occasion."

"Regrettably, these proposals have not received corresponding support to this day, and the issue of stopping the testing of thermonuclear weapons has not been resolved to this day."

The statement by the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union said, "However, all this will not prevent the Soviet Union from continuing to fight for the complete prohibition of atomic weapons, and for the immediate cessation of testing thermonuclear weapons as the first step in this direction."

    苏联支持日本国会禁止核子武器的决议
    新华社17日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科消息：苏联最高苏维埃在一项声明中表示完全支持日本国会今年二月所通过的关于禁止核子武器和停止试验这种武器的决议。
    声明表示，希望苏联和日本在这一崇高事业上的一致立场也将获得其他国家的议会的积极支持。
    苏联最高苏维埃会议在十六日通过的这一声明中说，“苏联最高苏维埃完全理解日本人民对继续扩充军备和不断试验原子武器和氢武器所特别表示的担忧。”
    “苏联认为，只有完全禁止原子武器和氢武器，即停止它的生产、禁止它的使用、销毁它的储备和从各国军备中取消它，世界各国人民才能摆脱毁灭性原子战争的威胁和由于使用这种武器而给人类带来的严重后果。”
    “正因为这样，苏联在战后这些年中坚持不懈地争取完全禁止原子武器和从各国军备中取消这种武器，并且不止一次地向联合国提出了相应的建议。”
    “遗憾的是，这些建议至今没有得到相应的支持，停止试验热核子武器的问题至今没有得到解决。”
    苏联最高苏维埃的声明说，“然而，这一切将不会使苏联不再为完全禁止原子武器、为立即停止试验热核子武器作为这方面的第一个步骤而奋斗。”
