    Since agricultural cooperativization, the productive enthusiasm of farmers has been unprecedentedly high. They hope to do more and better work in the cooperatives, so that they can earn more work points and more income. Under these circumstances, they feel that "going to town to buy things once takes away half a workday," so they demand "a store in the countryside" to bring goods to their doorsteps.
    To meet this demand from farmers, the work of adjusting the rural commercial network has been widely carried out throughout the country since the first half of this year. The state-owned commercial wholesale organizations should be established in counties and important market towns below the county level; the supply and marketing cooperatives will concentrate on retail sales, establishing stores in the townships, basically achieving "a store in every township." From the current situation, in areas where adjustments have been made well, it is more convenient for farmers to buy and sell things, the scope of commodity circulation has been further expanded, and small merchants and peddlers have also undergone socialist transformation. However, in many areas, the work of adjusting the commercial network has not yet been completed, and two deviations have occurred: one deviation is to overemphasize the complexity of this work, fearing difficulties and not daring to act; the other deviation is to completely ignore the complexity of this work, blindly increasing points, merging stores, and relocating merchants without careful research and planning. Both of these attitudes are obviously wrong.
    The current rural commercial network cannot remain unchanged, but it cannot be changed randomly. If it remains completely unchanged, it will not be able to meet the needs of farmers and adapt to the needs of expanding commodity circulation. When the peak season arrives, artificial tension in the rural market may also occur. However, the old commercial network has been formed naturally over many years. It has unreasonable aspects, but it also has reasonable aspects. If simple and crude methods are used to change it, the old will be destroyed, and the new will not be established, the needs of farmers will not be met, and chaos may occur in the rural market.
    Adjusting the rural commercial network is a difficult and complex matter. However, as long as we conduct arduous and meticulous investigation and research, understand the basic situation of the local area (such as the local villages, population, the distance between each village and the market town stores, township distribution stores, the distribution of the original commercial network, and the management capabilities of small merchants and peddlers, etc.), conduct typical surveys of the purchasing power of different economic types of villages and farmers, make preliminary plans in accordance with the principles of facilitating mass buying and selling, promoting the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas, and enabling merchants to maintain their livelihoods, supplement and revise according to the opinions of local township and village cadres and farmers, and obtain approval from relevant leading agencies, and gradually adjust, this work can basically meet the objective needs and be done quickly and well.
    The foundation of rural stores is the grassroots organization of supply and marketing cooperatives. However, it is impossible to have a store in every township relying solely on the organization and manpower of the supply and marketing cooperatives. Therefore, the supply and marketing cooperatives should organize small merchants and peddlers in rural areas. Existing small merchants and peddlers should naturally be well arranged, and even those who were originally half-farmers and half-merchants should be well utilized. These people originally opened small stores in the countryside, participating in agricultural production during the busy farming season and doing small business during the slack farming season. They are an indispensable force in the large network of material exchange between urban and rural areas. In the upsurge of agricultural cooperativization and agricultural production, these people abandoned business for agriculture, which had a great impact on material exchange between urban and rural areas. When adjusting the commercial network, the commercial departments can conduct good consultations with the agricultural production cooperatives, explain the principles to these small merchants and peddlers, and, on a completely voluntary basis, absorb some of them to continue to engage in commerce and restore the original small stores.
    The organizational form of rural stores is best to act as an agent for the supply and marketing cooperatives, but they can also directly purchase goods from state-owned stores. This can not only maintain the original business characteristics of small merchants and peddlers that facilitate customer buying and selling, but also encourage their business enthusiasm. The handling fees obtained by small merchants and peddlers for selling goods on consignment are similar to piecework wages. Therefore, these consignment stores should also be regarded as socialist enterprises. This point should be explained clearly to small merchants and peddlers.
    The operating methods of rural stores can be diverse. There must be people doing fixed store business, and there must be people providing mobile supplies in villages and fields; it is necessary to supply farmers with a variety of commodities, and it is also necessary to purchase farmers' small local products and by-products. Only in this way can it be more convenient for farmers to buy and sell and activate the rural economy.
    Rural stores should generally be led by specialized stores or comprehensive stores of supply and marketing cooperatives located in market towns. For rural stores in areas far from market towns or remote areas, supply and marketing cooperatives can entrust the local Party organizations in agricultural production cooperatives to conduct political and ideological leadership, and the supply and marketing cooperatives regularly send people to rural areas to guide and inspect work.
    In areas where the rural commercial network has not yet been adjusted, it is necessary to continue to organize small merchants and peddlers to deliver goods to the countryside for the time being. This is a better form of commercial service for agricultural production and the needs of farmers' lives, and farmers are very welcome. Moreover, organizing peddlers to deliver goods to the countryside in a planned way is also beneficial to understanding the economic situation in rural areas and formulating plans for adjusting the commercial network that meet the actual situation. Therefore, one should never despise or stop this activity of delivering goods to the countryside just because the commercial network is about to be adjusted.
    The small merchants and peddlers who deliver goods to the countryside can implement management methods such as dividing areas of responsibility, designating villages, and assigning people. At the same time, it is necessary to help them solve the difficulties of insufficient funds and appropriately increase consignment fees to give play to their enthusiasm. The activities of these small merchants and peddlers should be diverse, either visiting homes to purchase goods and delivering goods to the door; or setting up fixed stalls and displaying goods on the spot; or ordering goods at fixed times, ordering first and then delivering; or going deep into the fields; or selling at night. These many methods, as long as they meet the various needs of farmers, can be adopted.

### 把商品送到农民手里

    把商品送到农民手里
    农业合作化以后，农民的生产积极性空前高涨；他们希望在社里作的活儿又多又好，以便多挣一些工分，多得一些收入。在这种情况下，他们感到“上镇买一次东西，要少作半个劳动日”，因此要求“在乡下设个店”，把货物送到他们家门口来。
    适应农民的这种要求，从今年上半年开始，全国各地普遍展开调整农村商业网的工作。国营商业的批发机构要设立到县和县以下的重要集镇上去；供销合作社将集中力量进行零售，把商店设立到乡，基本上要做到“乡乡有店”。从目前的情况来看，凡是调整得好的地区，农民买卖东西更加方便，商品流转范围更加扩大，小商小贩也进行了社会主义改造。但是，不少地区调整商业网的工作到现在还没有作好，发生了两种偏向：一种偏向是过分地夸大这个工作的复杂性，害怕困难，不敢动手；另一种偏向是完全忽视了这个工作的复杂性，不经过慎重研究和规划，就盲目地增点、并店和迁移商户。这两种态度显然都是不对的。
    目前的农村商业网，不能不变动，又不能乱变动。如果完全不变动，就不能满足农民的要求，不能适应扩大商品流转的需要，等到市场旺季到来，还可能发生农村市场人为的紧张现象。但是，旧的商业网是多年来自然形成的，它有不合理的地方，也有合理的地方，如果采取简单、粗暴的方法加以改变，旧的毁掉了，新的又没有建立起来，农民的要求更不能满足，农村市场同样可能发生混乱现象。
    调整农村商业网是一件困难、复杂的事情。但是，只要进行艰苦、细致的调查研究，摸清当地的基本情况（例如当地的村庄、人口，各村和集镇商店、乡分销店的距离，原有商业网的分布情况和小商贩的经营能力等等），作好不同经济类型的村庄、农户的购买力的典型调查，按照便利群众买卖、促进城乡物资交流、使商贩能够维持生活等原则，作出初步规划，根据当地乡、村干部和农民的意见补充修正，经有关领导机关审查批准，逐步进行调整，这个工作就能够基本上符合客观的需要，做得又快又好。
    农村商店的基础是供销合作社的基层组织。但是，单靠供销合作社的组织和人力，不可能作到乡乡有店。因此，供销社就应该把农村中的小商贩组织起来。对于现有的小商贩，自然应该很好地加以安排，就是原有的半农半商的人们，也要很好地加以使用。这些人原在乡村开设小店，农忙的时候参加农业生产，农闲的时候做小生意。他们在城乡物资交流的大网中，是一支不可忽视的力量。在农业合作化和农业生产高潮中，这些人纷纷弃商就农，对城乡物资交流很有影响。在调整商业网的时候，商业部门可以同农业生产合作社很好地进行协商，并向这些小商贩讲清道理，在他们完全自愿的情况下，吸收他们当中的一部分继续经营商业，恢复原来的小店。
    农村商店的组织形式，最好是替供销合作社代销，但也可以直接向国营商店进货。这样既可以保持小商小贩原有的便利顾客买卖的经营特点，又可以鼓励他们的经营积极性。小商贩代销货物取得的手续费，类似计件工资，因此，这种代销小店也应该被看作社会主义性质的企业。这一点，要向小商贩解释清楚。
    农村商店的经营方式，可以是多种多样的。既要有人做固定的门市生意，又要有人在村庄、田头流动供应；既要向农民供应多样商品，又要收购农民的小土产和副产品。只有这样，才能更加便利农民买卖，活跃农村经济。
    农村商店一般地应由设在集镇上的供销社专业商店或综合商店领导；对于离集镇较远的或偏僻地区的农村商店，供销社可以委托当地农业生产合作社中的党组织进行政治思想领导，供销社定期派人流动下乡指导和检查工作。
    在农村商业网还没有调整好的地区，暂时还要继续组织小商贩送货下乡。这是商业为农业生产和农民生活需要服务的一个较好的形式，农民是非常欢迎的。而且，有计划地组织小贩送货下乡，对于了解农村的经济情况，制定符合实际情况的调整商业网的规划也有好处。所以决不应该因为快要调整商业网了，就轻视或停止这种送货下乡的活动。
    送货下乡的小商贩，可以实行划片分工、定村、定人的管理办法，同时要帮助他们解决资金不足的困难，适当地增加代销手续费，以发挥他们的积极性。这些小商贩的活动方式应该多种多样，或者登门收购，送货上门；或者固定摆摊，就地展览；或者定货定时，先定后送；或者深入田间；或者夜晚推销。这许许多多方式，只要是适合农民各种各样需要的，都可以采用。
