    Capitalists' Creative Activities Should Also Be Encouraged
    Xiao Gu
    Some time ago, when I was visiting Zhang Songpo, a young capitalist at the Shanghai Public-Private Joint Guanghua Optical Company, he shared an opinion with me. He said that, based on his work, he felt that some government departments often lacked active support and rewards for their (i.e., technically skilled capitalists) creative research work that was beneficial to the country, which somewhat affected their morale. He hoped to convey this opinion to relevant departments.
    Zhang Songpo is an active member of the Shanghai young industrialists and businessmen and participated in the National Congress of Young Activists in Industry and Commerce. He specializes in optical instruments. In the past six months, he has worked hard on technology and has successfully manufactured cystoscopes, urethroscopes, corneal microscopes, rhinoscopes, laryngoscopes, and other medical devices that have never been manufactured in China. Recently, he completed the only bronchoscope in Shanghai. He said that in the past, if a new product that had never existed in China was manufactured, one could make a fortune. Now, he has dedicated all of these to the country without reservation. However, when he reported these research achievements to the relevant state authorities, the responses were often very cold. Some took months to get a reply, and he received no rewards (even the research expenses were paid out of his own pocket). He said that he had helped a worker study how to improve the efficiency of grinding eyeglass lenses. After the research was successful, the efficiency increased many times over. The trade union praised the worker but made no mention of his help at all (he repeatedly stated to me that he was not asking for praise but felt that this practice was unfair).
    Zhang Songpo's opinion is worth noting because such things are by no means limited to this one case.
    There are approximately seven or eight thousand capitalists with certain specialized skills like Zhang Songpo in Shanghai, some of whom are special technical talents. This is a technical force that cannot be ignored. The general state of mind of these people is that they are satisfied with the rapid development of the country's construction and scientific and technological work, and they have also seen their bright future, are willing to accept socialist transformation, and strive to have better development and the opportunity to contribute their skills in the future. Their aspirations should be supported and encouraged.
    Some of our comrades still do not seem to know that after private industrial and commercial enterprises implemented overall public-private partnerships, the original capitalists and capitalist agents are already staff members of the public-private joint ventures. Their technical research work is already a part of the country's work. Failing to support or care about these activities that are beneficial to the country only frustrates these people's enthusiasm and harms the country's interests. We should adopt a positive attitude toward these technical forces, that is, we should care about and support their creative activities, organize their work, give appropriate rewards for their research achievements, and also offer well-intentioned criticisms of their shortcomings. Only in this way can we help capitalist personnel to be further transformed.

    资本家的创造活动也应当鼓励
    肖谷
    前些日子，我在访问上海公私合营光华眼镜公司的青年资本家张松坡的时候，他向我反映了一个意见。他说，他从自己的工作中，感到政府的有些部门对他们（即有技术的资本家）有益于国家的一些创造研究工作，还常常缺乏积极的支持和奖励，以致多少影响了他们的情绪。他希望把这个意见转告给有关的部门。
    张松坡是上海青年工商业者中的积极分子，曾经参加了全国工商界青年积极分子大会。他是专门研究光学仪器的，近半年来，在钻研技术上很努力，先后制造成功了膀胱镜、尿道镜、角膜显微镜、鼻喉镜等国内从未制造过的医疗器械，最近他又完成了上海仅有的一只气管镜。他说，在过去，如果制造出了国内没有过的新产品，就能发一笔大财。现在他把这些都无保留地献给了国家。但是，当他把这些研究成果向国家有关机关上报的时候，得到的回答常常非常冷淡，有的一拖几个月没有回音，也没有得到什么奖励（连研究费用也是他自己拿出来的）。他说，他曾帮助一个工人研究提高磨眼镜片的效率，研究成功后效率提高了许多倍，工会表扬了这位工人，却完全没有提到他的帮助（他一再向我申明，他并不是要求表扬，而是觉得这种做法不公平）。
    张松坡反映的这个意见是值得注意的。因为像这类的事情，绝不只是这一件。
    像张松坡这样具有一定专门技术的资本家，在上海大约有七、八千人，其中有一部分人是特种技术人材。这是一支不可忽视的技术力量。这些人一般的思想状况是：对国家建设事业和科学技术工作的迅速发展感到满意，从而也看清了自己的光明前途，愿意接受社会主义改造，争取今后能有更好地发展和贡献自己技术的机会。他们的这种愿望应当得到支持和鼓励。
    我们有些同志至今似乎还不知道，私营工商业在实行全行业公私合营以后，原来企业的资本家和资本家代理人已经是公私合营企业的工作人员，他们的技术研究工作已是国家工作的一部分，不支持不关心这些有利于国家的活动，结果只是挫伤了这些人的积极性，损害了国家的利益。我们对这些技术力量应当采取积极的态度，即应当关心和支持他们的创造性活动，把他们的工作组织起来，对于他们的研究成果给予相应的奖励，对于他们的某些缺点也可以作善意的批评。只有这样，才能帮助资方人员得到进一步改造。
