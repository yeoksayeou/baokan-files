    Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: By the end of June, more than 15,700 farmers in the suburbs of Beijing had passed the literacy graduation examination and received literacy graduation certificates.
    The farmers celebrated this happy event with gongs and drums. Members of the Liulangzhuang Agricultural Production Cooperative even performed the local traditional drama - Five Tiger Staffs. Many townships in the eastern suburbs, Haidian District, and other areas held exhibitions displaying the learning achievements of farmers participating in literacy studies.
    These farmers have all learned more than 1,500 characters and can keep labor record books and read simple and popular books and newspapers. Many of them have entered higher elementary classes to continue their studies. Some also serve in the township's literacy work in the literacy association.
    Currently, agricultural production cooperatives that have basically eliminated illiteracy have emerged in the suburbs of Beijing. In the Hebei Agricultural Production Cooperative in Bei'anhe Township, Haidian District, 70% of young and middle-aged people have escaped illiteracy, and many have become work recorders, technicians, and statisticians. In the Mayufangzi Village Agricultural Production Cooperative in Changping District, last year, anything that required writing had to be done by elementary school teachers. Now, many cadres and young people in this cooperative have not only learned to write but can also use the abacus for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

    一万五千多农民领到扫盲学习毕业证书
    据新华社讯　到六月底为止，北京市郊区有一万五千七百多名农民经过扫盲毕业考试，领到了扫盲学习毕业证书。
    农民们敲锣打鼓欢庆这件喜事。六郎庄农业生产合作社的社员还演了本乡传统的戏剧——五虎棍。东郊、海淀等区的许多个乡用参加扫盲学习农民的学习成绩举办了展览会。
    这些农民都认识了一千五百多个字，能记劳动手册、阅读浅近通俗的书报。其中有不少人升入了高小班继续学习。有的人还在扫盲协会担任乡的扫盲工作。
    现在，北京市郊区已经出现了基本上扫除了文盲的农业生产合作社。海淀区北安河乡和平农业生产合作社有70％的青年、壮年摆脱了文盲状态，不少人还做了记工员、技术员和统计员。昌平区麻峪房子村农业生产合作社，去年凡是动笔的事，都得请小学教师代劳，现在这个社的许多干部和青年不但学会了书写，而且还能用算盘作加、减、乘、除。
