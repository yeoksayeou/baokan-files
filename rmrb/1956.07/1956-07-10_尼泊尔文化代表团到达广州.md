Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, July 9th. The Nepalese Cultural Delegation, consisting of twenty-one members and led by the head of the delegation, the Minister of Education and Health of the Kingdom of Nepal, Mr. Ba. Sharma, arrived in Guangzhou at 4:00 PM today for a friendly visit to China at the invitation of the Ministry of Culture of the People's Republic of China. Welcoming them at the station were Chen Ru Tang, Deputy Governor of Guangdong Province, and Guo Qiao Ran, Deputy Mayor of Guangzhou, among others. Wang Zi Cheng and Yang Feng Zhu, representatives of the Ministry of Culture, made a special trip to Shenzhen to greet them.

In Guangzhou, Mr. Sharma told Xinhua News Agency reporters: Nepal and China originally had very ancient friendly relations, but for a period of time, this relationship was not direct. This delegation's visit to the People's Republic of China hopes to re-establish the relationship that existed in the past. He said: Nepal and China are close neighbors, and the friendly relations between the two countries should grow day by day. This is not only the wish of all members of the delegation, but also the wish of the Nepalese government, the Nepalese people, and the King of Nepal himself. He said that the delegation also brought letters of respect from the King of Nepal, the Prime Minister, and the Nepalese people to Chairman Mao Zedong, Premier Zhou Enlai, and the Chinese people.

Chen Ru Tang, Deputy Governor of Guangdong Province, and Guo Qiao Ran, Deputy Mayor of Guangzhou, received all members of the delegation at 7:00 PM this evening and hosted a banquet to welcome them.
