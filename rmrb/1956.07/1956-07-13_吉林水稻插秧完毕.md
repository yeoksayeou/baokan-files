Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, July 12th: Agricultural cooperatives in Jilin Province have completed rice transplanting after more than twenty days of intense work. This is in addition to the direct-sown rice, which was planted earlier.

According to statistics, the total rice planting area in Jilin Province this year reached 280,100 hectares, nearly double that of last year. The early-planted rice seedlings are now growing very lushly, and farmers everywhere are busy weeding and applying fertilizer in the paddy fields. Mid-June was the most intensive season for transplanting. However, due to continuous rain, transplanting was delayed in about 30% of the paddy fields. Agricultural departments are taking effective technical measures to help agricultural cooperatives accelerate the ripening of this portion of the rice.

Planting rice is one of the important measures for increasing grain production in Jilin Province. The yield per hectare is about 4,000 jin more than that of ordinary early-maturing grain crops.

    吉林水稻插秧完毕
    新华社长春12日电　吉林省各地的农业社，经过最近二十多天的紧张插秧，都种完了水稻。因为直播的水稻早已种下去了。
    据统计，今年吉林全省种水稻的面积共达二十八万零一百公顷，比去年增加了近一倍。现在，种得早的稻苗都长得很茂盛，各地农民在水田里紧张除草和追肥。六月中旬是插秧最紧张的季节。但由于雨水连绵，因此各地约有30％的稻田插秧较迟。农业部门正采取一些有效的技术措施帮助农业社加快这部分水稻的成熟。
    种水稻是吉林省增产粮食的重要措施之一。每公顷可比一般早作粮食作物多收约四千斤粮食。
