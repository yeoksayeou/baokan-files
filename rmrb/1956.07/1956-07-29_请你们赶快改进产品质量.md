Please Quickly Improve Product Quality

    One Rotten Apple Spoils the Whole Barrel
    Over 300 "ㄨ50" type freight cars produced by the Qiqihar Rolling Stock Plant from April to June this year were all detained at Qiqihar Station or on dedicated lines and could not be operated, resulting in a loss of more than 140,000 vehicle-hours, due to the poor quality of their couplings, which affected traffic safety.
      The couplings on the "ㄨ50" type freight cars were produced by Shanghai Asia Steel Plant and Qingdao Sifang Rolling Stock Plant. From April to June this year, the Qiqihar Rolling Stock Plant received more than 1,700 couplings manufactured by Shanghai Asia Steel Plant. After inspection, only more than 300 of them met the standards. During the same period, of the more than 1,200 couplings manufactured by Sifang Rolling Stock Plant, less than half met the standards.
    The Qiqihar Rolling Stock Plant has repeatedly made written suggestions to them, requesting them to improve the quality of the couplings. The quality of the couplings produced by Sifang Rolling Stock Plant later improved, but the couplings from Shanghai Asia Steel Plant remained the same as before, with no improvement. Zhang Zhichen

  "Forever" Brand Bicycles That Aren't Forever
    Our organization recently bought more than ten "Forever" brand bicycles produced by the Shanghai Bicycle Factory. The comrades were happy to see these brand new bicycles, saying, "Now we can ride Shanghai goods!" But in less than a month, most of these bicycles were taken for repairs. It turned out that "Forever" brand bicycles aren't forever; some lost their chains or had flat tires before travelling a mile, and they had to push the bicycles back; some had their bells or pedals fall off as soon as they started riding. Our organization has a rule: whoever damages a bicycle must state the reason before being reimbursed for the repair cost. Everyone feels embarrassed to damage a new bicycle and have to find a reason to get reimbursed for the repair cost, and repairing the damaged bicycles also delays work and causes a lot of trouble. Therefore, when they need to go out, they would rather walk than ride a "Forever" brand bicycle.
    We hope that the Shanghai Bicycle Factory will carefully check why "Forever" brand bicycles break down so easily.

    A Generator That Can't Generate Electricity
    Our school bought a hand-cranked AC/DC generator produced by the Shanghai Jinghua Scientific Instrument Factory at the end of last year for thirteen yuan for teaching purposes; little did we know that this kind of generator couldn't generate electricity at all. Later, we mailed it back to the Shanghai Jinghua Scientific Instrument Factory for repair, urging them repeatedly. It was not until the end of April this year that it was sent back. After the repair, the generator could finally generate electricity, but it could only make a six-volt light bulb emit a faint red light. We used all our strength to crank it, sweating profusely, but the current produced could only make the pointer of the galvanometer move a few times. This kind of generator can only be used as a model and cannot be used for teaching experiments at all.

    Wire Pliers That Can't Cut a Sheet of Paper
    The seven-inch "Hu Gong" brand wire pliers produced by the Shanghai Xuhua Machine Factory are described on the packaging box as: "Made of high carbon steel by die forging and subjected to appropriate heat treatment, with hardness and strength meeting the standards." We publicized this product according to the product packaging instructions, but we didn't expect this product to be so bad. A factory in Harbin bought 300 of them, and more than 100 broke within two days of use, and they came to demand a refund. The three wire pliers we sold to an agricultural cooperative in the suburbs were also returned the next day.
    According to the standard, this kind of wire pliers should be able to cut off number 10 iron wire, but after our test, the head of the wire pliers broke before the iron wire was cut off. We then used it to cut a one-centimeter thick piece of paper, and as a result, the head of the wire pliers also broke before the paper was cut. We don't know why the product quality of the Shanghai Xuhua Machine Factory is so bad.

  Not Prickly Heat Powder, but Talcum Powder
    The 25-gram prickly heat powder produced under the supervision of the China Pharmaceutical Company, with the words "cool, anti-itch, smooth, and sterilizing" written on the paper bag, I bought a package, and after bathing, I put it on my body, but it was neither cool nor anti-itch. At first, I thought maybe only this package was ineffective, so I bought another package, but it was still the same. Many people say that this is not prickly heat powder, but talcum powder.

      "Insurance Lock"
    The bicycle lock manufactured by the Shenyang Local State-owned Metal Products Factory is very difficult to use. Our organization recently bought two of them, and both are difficult to open. When opening, one hand has to use the key to insert into the lock and shake, and the other hand has to pull the lock bolt outward with force. Sometimes, opening a lock once is so urgent and strenuous that you sweat all over and still can't open it. It's really an "insurance lock"! Cao Qinzhao

    A Small Electric Fan with a Malfunctioning Switch
    Our organization recently bought dozens of small electric fans for office use. This kind of small electric fan looks very beautiful and is quite lightweight to hold. Everyone said it was good when they saw it. However, after using it for a few days, it was found that the switch was not easy to turn, and the fan made abnormal noises when it was running. Although repairs were carried out, the switches of almost all the small electric fans lost their effectiveness in less than a month. We hope that the Shanghai Huasheng Electrical Appliance Factory, a joint state-private enterprise that produces this kind of small electric fan, will quickly improve product quality.

    请你们赶快改进产品质量
    一只老鼠坏了一锅粥
    齐齐哈尔机车车辆制造厂今年四月至六月间出厂的三百多辆“ㄨ50”型货车，由于车钩的质量低劣，影响行车安全，全部被扣留在齐齐哈尔站内或专用线上不能行驶，共损失十四万多车辆小时。
      “ㄨ50”型货车上的车钩是上海亚细亚钢铁厂和青岛四方机车车辆制造厂生产的。齐齐哈尔机车车辆制造厂今年四月至六月间共收到上海亚细亚钢铁厂制造的车钩一千七百多个，经过检查，合规格的只有三百多个。同时期收到的四方机车车辆制造厂制造的一千二百多个车钩，合规格的还不到一半。
    齐齐哈尔机车车辆制造厂曾几次向他们提出书面意见，要求提高车钩质量。四方机车车辆制造厂后来出厂的车钩质量就有了好转，但是上海亚细亚钢铁厂的车钩仍同过去一样，没有什么改进。　张秩宸
  “永久牌”自行车不永久
    我们机关最近买来十多辆上海自行车厂生产的“永久牌”自行车。同志们看到这些崭新的车子都乐得说：“咱们可骑到上海货啦！”可是不到一个月，这些车子大部分都拿去补修了。原来“永久牌”自行车不永久，有的骑不到一里路，练子就掉了，车胎就跑气，结果还得推着车子回来；有的刚骑上还没有用力，车铃铛或脚踏子就掉了。我们机关有一项制度：不管任何人骑坏了车子，都得说出理由才给报销修车费。大家觉得把新车子骑坏了找理由报销修车费很难为情，而且车子坏了修理还要耽误事，添好多麻烦，因此有事出去宁可用两腿走，也不愿骑“永久牌”自行车啦。
    希望上海自行车厂好好检查一下，为什么“永久牌”的自行车那么容易坏？

    发电机不能发电
    我们学校因为教学需要，去年年底花了十三元买来一架上海景华科学仪器厂出产的手摇式交直流两用发电机；谁知这种发电机根本发不出电来。后来，我们把它邮回上海景华科学仪器厂去修理，屡次催促，直到今年四月底才寄回来。修理以后，发电机总算是能发电了，可是它只能使六伏特的小电珠发出一点微弱的红光。我们用尽浑身的力气去摇它，累得满头大汗，但是所产生的电流仅能使灵敏电流计的指针转动几下。这种发电机只能作为模型，根本无法进行教学试验。

    钢丝钳难剪一分纸
    上海叙华机器厂生产的七吋沪工牌钢丝钳，据包装盒上的说明是：“用高炭钢经模锻后制造并经适当热处理，其硬度和强度均符合标准”的。我们按照这个产品包装说明进行了宣传，可是没想到这种产品非常糟糕。哈尔滨市某厂买了三百把去，使用不到两天，就有一百多把断了头，找来要求退货。我们卖给郊区某农业社的三把钢丝钳，也是第二天就被退了回来。
    按标准，这种钢丝钳应该可以剪断十号铁线，可是经我们试验，铁线还没有剪断，钢丝钳的头就断了。我们又用它来剪一分厚的纸，结果纸还没有剪断，钢丝钳的头也断了。不知道上海叙华机器厂的产品质量为什么这么坏。

  不是痱子粉，是滑石粉
    中国医药公司监制的25克痱子粉，纸袋上写着“有阴凉、止痒、爽滑、杀菌作用”，我买了一包，浴后扑在身上，不凉也不止痒。最初以为也许只这一包失效，又买了一包，结果还是这样。很多人都说这不是痱子粉，是滑石粉。　清　晨
      “保险锁”
    沈阳地方国营金属用品制造厂制造的自行车锁非常不好使。我们机关最近买了两把，都是锁上不好开。开的时候得一只手用钥匙插到锁里边摇，另一只手拉着锁栓用力往外拔，有时开一次锁连急带费劲，累得满头大汗，也开不开。真是

    开关失效的小电扇
    我们机关最近买了几十部办公用的小电扇。这种小电扇从外表上看很漂亮，拿着也挺轻便，大家看到都说好。但是使用不几天，就发现开关扭动不自如，扇子转动的时候发出不正常的响声。虽然进行了修理，可是使用不到一个月，小电扇的开关差不多全部失去了效用，希望生产这种小电扇的公私合营上海华生电气厂迅速改进产品质量。
