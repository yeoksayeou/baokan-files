Xinhua News Agency, Fuxin, 19th. The Fuxin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China convened a safety conference from the 16th to the 18th, attended by leading personnel from various production factories, mines, and basic construction units in the city.

    The conference examined and criticized the erroneous thinking of pitting production against safety, and determined to focus on safety work in the recent month or so, concentrate efforts on promoting the safe production experience of the Jiaozuo Mining Bureau, and further advance the advanced producer movement.

    Unsafe production has become a key problem hindering the in-depth development of the advanced producer movement and the comprehensive completion of the state plan here. The continuous occurrence of accidents has severely frustrated the production enthusiasm of workers and affected the completion of the state plan. In the first half of this year, the Fuxin Mining Bureau lost 48,840 tons of coal due to workers' work-related injuries, calculated according to average efficiency.

    At the meeting, the Fuxin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and the leading personnel of various units examined and criticized the erroneous thinking of only paying attention to quantity and speed in production and construction, while neglecting quality, economy, and safety. Due to pitting safety against production, some leading personnel, faced with tight tasks, mistakenly put technical safety regulations out of their minds in order to complete output targets, even taking the lead in violating regulations and operating recklessly; in order to save money, they reduced safety measure expenditures. Many staff members only paid lip service to safety, and there were no safety measures ensured in the production plan. Regular safety inspections, safety analysis meetings, and safety report systems were not implemented, and safety education for workers was insufficient.

    Through discussion, the attendees realized that as long as the policy of safe production is clarified ideologically, and safety work is strengthened in terms of technical and organizational measures, major liability accidents and fatalities can be completely avoided, and production tasks can be completed even more outstandingly.

    At the end of the meeting, the Fuxin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China made a decision on "Implementing the Policy of Safe Production and Learning from Jiaozuo's Safe Production Experience," requiring all factories, mines, and basic construction units to focus on promoting the safe production experience of the Jiaozuo Mining Bureau while promoting various advanced experiences, focusing on the key safety issues in current production and construction, so as to gradually make safety work planned, mass-based, institutionalized, and disciplined, reverse the deteriorating safety situation, deepen the advanced producer movement, and ensure the overfulfillment of various economic indicators in 1956.

    解决阻碍全面完成计划的关键问题
    阜新市委纠正忽视安全的倾向
    新华社阜新19日电　中共阜新市委员会在十六日到十八日召集全市各生产厂矿和基本建设单位的领导人员举行安全会议。
    这次会议检查批判了把生产和安全对立起来的错误思想，确定在最近一个多月中以安全工作为中心，集中力量推广焦作矿务局的安全生产经验，把先进生产者运动进一步向前推进。
    生产不安全已经成为这里当前阻碍先进生产者运动深入开展和全面完成国家计划的关键问题。由于事故的不断发生，严重地挫折了职工的生产积极性，影响了国家计划的完成。阜新矿务局在今年上半年，按照平均效率计算，只是生产工人因为工伤歇工就少产煤四万八千八百四十吨。
    会上，中共阜新市委员会和各单位的领导人员检查和批判了在生产、建设中只注意多、快，忽视好、省、安全的错误思想。由于把安全和生产对立起来，有些领导人员在紧张的任务面前，为了完成产量任务，就错误地把技术安全规程置于脑后，甚至带头违反规程制度，冒险作业；为了节约，削减了安全措施费用。很多工作人员只是在口头上注意安全，而在生产计划中没有确保安全的措施。经常性的安全检查、安全分析会议和安全汇报等制度都没有实行，对职工安全教育不够。
    出席会议的人员经过讨论，认识到只要从思想上明确了安全生产的方针，从技术措施和组织措施上加强安全工作，重大责任事故和死亡事故完全可以避免，生产任务也能完成得更出色。
    中共阜新市委员会在会议最后作出了“贯彻执行安全生产方针、学习焦作安全生产经验”的决定，要求各厂矿、基本建设单位针对当前生产建设中的安全方面的关键问题，在推广各种先进经验的同时，要大力着重推广焦作矿务局安全生产的经验，使安全工作逐步做到计划化、群众化、制度化和纪律化，扭转安全情况恶劣的局面，使先进生产者运动得到深入开展，保证超额完成1956年各项经济指标。
