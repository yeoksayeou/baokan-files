    Sincere Greetings
    Editor's Note: After our newspaper published Ma Shaobo's "Unforgettable Night Banquet" on July 1, we received a letter from an unnamed couple of readers entrusted to our newspaper to forward to Mr. Ichikawa Ennosuke. This letter expresses the Chinese people's respect and love for Mr. Ichikawa Ennosuke and the deep friendship between the Chinese and Japanese people. We are now publishing this letter in our newspaper. The original letter has been forwarded to Mr. Ichikawa Ennosuke.

Mr. Ennosuke:
    Deep respect from the bottom of my heart propels my pen, and it is already midnight. The article "Unforgettable Night Banquet" conveyed to us your deep friendship for the Chinese people; we naturally have a quick response. No wonder you can be called a performer of folk art; even your family banquet can so meaningfully express the sincere feelings between our two peoples!

    The song "Ryushin Uchi," although sung in your garden, the Chinese people who have experienced many disasters and just freed themselves from oppression, know very well how to care for and listen to the voices of such oppressed people.

    Indeed, how can sincere feelings be blocked by the Milky Way?! The wishes symbolized on the "Tanabata ribbon" will surely be transformed into human reality in endless cheerful laughter.

    According to your wife, "Mr. Ennosuke rarely laughs so heartily." This cannot help but remind people of the common experience of the entire Japanese nation. However, the flowers of art will eventually bloom, and the laughter of the people cannot be suppressed forever.

    We believe that the light of independence, peace, and democracy will surely shine on Japan, and the era of promoting and developing Japanese folk art is coming soon; even if the current difficulties still require us to have a sober estimate of them.

    We wish the 69-year-old a long life to a hundred years, and make greater contributions to world peace and human culture!

    Thank you to your daughters for releasing fireflies for our peace envoys!

    Thank you to your wife for the gifts to the eighty-six Chinese guests!

    Thank you to the Japanese people for cultivating such good wishes in your family!

    If possible, we hope that you and your friends and relatives will come to Beijing to perform again! We regret that we were unable to see it last time due to circumstances.

    Please convey our greetings to the Japanese literary and intellectual circles, and convey our greetings to the Japanese people who are bravely fighting for independence, peace, and democracy!

    Greetings to your wife and all your family members!

    Greetings to the guests of the "Night Banquet"!

Salute,
    Readers of People's Daily
                                            A couple from Beijing
                                        Late night, July 1

### 真挚的问候

专栏：读者来信

    真挚的问候
    编者按：　本报七月一日发表马少波的“难忘的夜宴”
  一文后，收到了一对未署名的读者夫妇托本报转寄给市川猿之助先生的一封信。这封信表达了中国人民对市川猿之助先生的敬爱和中日两国人民之间的深厚友情。现在将这封信在本报发表。原信已转寄给市川猿之助先生。猿之助先生：
    内心深处的敬意催动着我的笔尖，这时已经是子夜。“难忘的夜宴”一文，给我们传来了您对中国人民的深厚友情；我们自然会有很快的反应。怪不得您能够被称为民间艺术的表演家，连您的家庭宴会，也可以那么意味深长地表达我们两国人民的真挚感情！
    “流新内”一曲，虽然是在您的庭园演唱；经历过重重灾难，刚从压迫中解脱出来的中国人民，是很懂得怎样去关心听取这种被压迫人民的声音的。
    诚然，真挚的感情，哪是银河可以阻挡？！“七夕带”上象征着的愿望，必将在无穷的开朗的喜笑声中，化为人间的现实。
    据您的夫人告诉别人：“猿之助先生很少这样痛快的笑过。”这不免令人想起整个日本民族的共同遭遇。但是，艺术之花终将怒放，民间的喜笑总不能够永远被压抑。
    相信独立、和平、民主的光芒必将普照日本，日本民间艺术发扬光大的时期即将到来；纵令眼前的困难依然要我们对它有清醒的估计。
    祝六九老人百年长寿，为世界和平与人类文化有更大的贡献！
    谢谢您家的女孩们为我们的和平使者放起的萤虫！
    谢谢您的夫人对八十六位中国客人的馈赠！
    谢谢日本人民给您的家庭培养起来的这样良好的愿望！
    如果可能，希望您和您的亲友们再来北京表演！上次因事未能看到，颇为遗憾。
    请代向日本文艺界知识界致意，并代向为独立、和平、民主而英勇奋斗的日本人民致意！
    问候您的夫人和您的全家成员！
    问候“夜宴”的陪宾们！敬礼　人民日报读者
                                            北京市的一对夫妇
                                        七月一日深夜
