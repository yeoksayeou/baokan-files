    Important Cultural Relics Discovered in Southern Shanxi

    (Our dispatch) The Shanxi Provincial Cultural Relics Survey Experimental Work Team, jointly organized by the Cultural Relics Bureau of the Ministry of Culture and the Shanxi Provincial Bureau of Culture, conducted a survey in southern Shanxi in early April. It completed the survey task in June and is now sorting out materials and summarizing experiences. The cultural relics, historical sites, and revolutionary memorials they have harvested are extremely rich. In Quwo County alone, more than 40 sites were discovered. From the Paleolithic Age to the Han Dynasty, there are traces of human habitation in almost every historical stage. Among them, the Paleolithic Age site is the most important.

    This site is located in the quarrying layer of the Fushui River valley in Xigou, Licun, Quwo. The site covers an area of approximately 50 meters east-west and 30 meters north-south. There are crafted stone tools and vertebrate fossils in the gravel layer under the red soil layer. The stone tools obtained this time include stone balls, stone core tools, and stone flake tools, totaling about 30 pieces. Based on the discovery situation and shape of the relics, they are basically the same as the Paleolithic site in Dingcun, Xiangfen County. This discovery provides new materials for the history of the Paleolithic Age in China.

    The sites discovered in Anyi County range from the late Neolithic period to the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods, including a series of large and small sites connected together. In terms of ancient architecture, in addition to the famous Dabei Temple built in the Song Dynasty in Qucun, Quwo, two Yuan Dynasty wooden structures and more than ten pagodas from the Tang, Song, Yuan, and Ming Dynasties were also discovered in Anyi County. Among the scattered cultural relics are statues and stone tablets from the Northern Zhou, Tang, and Song Dynasties, all of which have high historical value. The Tang Dynasty Salt Pond, the Lingqing Gong Ancestral Hall stele, and the Song Dynasty Daguan Shengzu stele in Anyi County are the most important.

    Four stone cave statues and cliff statues were discovered in Luan County. The one at Shizhuang Shouyang Mountain is the largest in scale, dating back to the late Northern Wei Dynasty at the earliest, and around the Song and Yuan Dynasties at the latest. The mountainous area near Luan County was the old revolutionary base area during the War of Resistance Against Japan. This time, a total of more than 40 revolutionary monuments, memorial pavilions, and other items were surveyed. Many revolutionary sites were also discovered in the Taihang Mountains.

    In other areas, a large number of Neolithic, Yangshao, Longshan, and other period sites, ancient tombs, ancient buildings of past dynasties, and scattered cultural relics were also discovered.

    Now, after the work team completes the task of sorting out materials and summarizing experiences, it will enter the re-examination stage.

    山西南部发现重要文物
    本报讯　文化部文物管理局和山西省文化局共同组织的山西省文物普查试验工作队，于四月初到晋南一带进行普查工作，六月间已经完成了普查任务，现在正整理材料和总结经验。他们所收获的文物古迹以及革命纪念物，极为丰富。曲沃一县就发现了遗址四十多处，从旧石器时代一直到汉代，几乎每一个历史阶段中，都有人类居住的遗迹，其中尤以旧石器时代遗址为最重要。
    这个遗址在曲沃里村西沟，滏水河谷中的采石层里。遗址范围东西约五十公尺，南北约三十公尺。在红土层下砾石层中有打制石器，有脊椎动物化石。这次获得的石器，为石球、石核器和石片制器等约三十件。根据遗物发现的情况和形制，同襄汾县丁村的旧石器遗址基本相同。这个发现给中国旧石器时代历史提供了新的材料。
    安邑县发现的遗址，从新石器晚期一直到春秋战国的都有，其中有一系列的大小遗址多处联系起来的。古建筑方面，除曲沃曲村著名的宋代所建的大悲院以外，在安邑县还发现了元代木结构建筑两座，以及唐、宋、元、明各时代的塔十多座。在流散文物中有北周、唐、宋的造像和石碑，都有很高的历史价值，而以安邑县的唐盐池、灵庆公祠碑和宋大观圣作的碑为最重要。
    潞安县发现四处石窟造像和摩崖造像，师庄寿阳山的规模最大，年代早的到北魏晚期，晚的也在宋、元左右。潞安县近山地区，原为抗日战争时期的老根据地，这次共调查了革命纪念碑、纪念亭等四十多处。太行山上也发现了不少的革命遗迹。
    其他各地区也都发现了新石器、仰韶、龙山等各时期的遗址，古墓葬和历代古建筑以及流散文物的数量很大。
    现在工作队待整理材料和总结经验这一段工作完成以后，将进入复查阶段。　　　　　　臧华云
