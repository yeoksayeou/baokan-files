    Moving Ahead of the Rainy Season
    Residents Rush to Repair Dangerous Houses
    (Our newspaper reports) By the end of June, approximately 90% of the more than 40,000 dilapidated houses in residential areas of Beijing's various districts that needed repair this year have been repaired.
    Beijing has 600,000 old houses, most of which were built a hundred years ago. To ensure the safety of the lives and property of residents living in these houses, the People's Government mobilizes the vast number of residents to conduct self-inspections and repairs every year before the rainy season. The government has also issued a large number of housing repair loans; last year alone, 330,000 yuan in loans and more than 5,000 yuan in relief funds were issued. From 1953 to 1955, more than 150,000 instances of dangerous houses have been repaired.

    走在雨季前面
    居民赶修危险房屋
    本报讯　北京市各城区的居民住宅中，今年需要修缮的四万多间破旧房屋，到六月底止已经约有90％修缮完了。
    北京市的古老房屋有六十万间，其中大部分是在一百年前修盖的。为了保证居住在这些房屋的居民生命财产的安全，每年雨季前，人民政府都要发动广大居民自检自修。政府还发放了大批房屋修缮贷款，仅去年一年就发放了三十三万元贷款，五千多元救济款。从1953年到1955年，已有十五万多间次危险房屋经过修缮。
