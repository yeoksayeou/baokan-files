Ten Exploration Wells Have Spouted Crude Oil
Karamay Once Again Proven to Be China's Largest Oil Region Currently
(Our newspaper's dispatch from Urumqi, July 11th) Ten exploration wells in the Karamay oil region have already spouted crude oil.

\tA year ago, when the first exploration well was drilled, some people said: The Karamay area has asphalt outcrops, and the hope of finding oil is not high. Now, ten exploration wells have successively produced oil, powerfully proving that Karamay is a large oil region in China with the largest oil content currently, shallow oil layers, high pressure, and self-flowing oil.

\tIn June 1955, when drilling technician Lu Mingbao led drilling workers to Karamay, it was still a desolate grassland and Gobi desert. In just one year, drilling derricks have sprung up like bamboo shoots after a rain. The workers of the drilling teams have now completed fifteen exploration wells, and new exploration wells are also being drilled one after another.

\tCurrently, more than 4,000 people transferred from the Production and Construction Corps of the Xinjiang Military Region are stepping up the construction of the highway from Dushanzi to Karamay. By mid-August, the wide highway will be completed, and large quantities of materials and equipment will be continuously transported to Karamay via the highway.

\tBoketu, 47 kilometers away from Karamay, has abundant water sources. A dam will be built here, and water pipes will be laid from here to the oil region. Currently, the technical design of the dam project is underway, and construction is expected to begin in August. After the first phase of the dam project is completed, it can initially store 5 million cubic meters of water, and the industrial water and drinking water in the oil region will have a relatively reliable source.

\tThe offices and dormitories in the Karamay oil region are being stepped up by the engineering team of the Xinjiang Military Region Production and Construction Corps. In the third quarter, the area of ​​houses built by this engineering team in the Karamay oil region will reach more than 13,000 square meters.

\tThe biggest problem in developing the Karamay oil region is the shortage of transportation capacity. The People's Government of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region has transferred a large number of vehicles to provide support, but it still cannot keep up with the needs of the developing situation. Now, the Xinjiang Petroleum Administration is actively organizing forces and looking forward to the support from all over the country.

### 十口探井已喷出原油  克拉玛依再次被证明是我国当前最大油区

    十口探井已喷出原油
    克拉玛依再次被证明是我国当前最大油区
    本报乌鲁木齐11日电　克拉玛依油区已经有十口探井喷出了原油。
    一年前，当第一口探井开钻的时候，有人说：克拉玛依地区沥青露头，含油的希望不大。现在，十口探井相继出油了，有力地证明了克拉玛依是我国当前含油量最大、油层距地面浅、压力大、石油能够自喷的一个大油区。
    1955年6月，当钻井技师陆铭宝率领钻井工人来到克拉玛依的时候，这里还是一片荒芜的草原和戈壁。仅仅一年，探井的井架像雨后的春笋一样，一座一座地竖立起来。钻井队的工人们，现在已经钻完十五口探井，新的探井也陆续开钻了。
    目前，从新疆军区生产建设部队调来的四千多人，正在加紧修建从独山子到克拉玛依的公路，到八月中旬，宽阔的公路便可竣工，大批的物资器材，将通过公路源源不断地运往克拉玛依。
    距克拉玛依四十七公里的博克图，有很充足的水源。这里将修建拦河坝，并将从这里铺设通向油区的水管。现在，拦河坝工程的技术设计正在进行，预计八月份可以动工。拦河坝第一期工程完成后，可以初步蓄水五百万立方公尺，油区的工业用水和饮水也就有了比较可靠的来源。
    克拉玛依油区的办公室和宿舍正由新疆军区生产建设部队的工程队在加紧修建。克拉玛依油区在第三季度内，由这个工程队建筑的房屋面积将达一万三千多平方公尺。
    当前开发克拉玛依油区最大的问题是运输力量的不足。新疆维吾尔自治区人民委员会抽调了大批车辆前往支援，还是赶不上形势发展的需要。现在，新疆石油管理局正在积极组织力量，并且期待全国各地的支援。
