    Anshan Construction Machinery Repair Factory Produces 15 Kinds of Construction Machinery Parts
    (Our newspaper's dispatch from Shenyang) The Construction Machinery Repair Factory of Anshan Metallurgical and Chemical Construction Corporation, built last year, recently successfully trial-produced fifteen kinds of construction machinery parts, including four-row chains for excavators and tractors, high-pressure oil pumps, walking chains, copper sleeves, pistons, flexible shafts for concrete vibrators, rubber tubes, etc. These parts are frequently used when repairing construction machinery. In the past, because Anshan could not manufacture them itself and they were not easy to buy domestically, many construction machines often had to be shut down due to the lack of a single part. The successful trial production of these fifteen important parts will play a significant role in ensuring the normal operation of machinery and improving the utilization rate of equipment. The Anshan Metallurgical and Chemical Construction Corporation has decided to allocate 2,000 yuan in bonuses to reward employees who actively participated in the trial production work.

    鞍山建筑机械修理厂制成15种建筑机械配件
    本报沈阳电　去年建成的鞍山冶金化学建筑总公司的建筑机械修理厂，最近试制成功了十五种建筑机械配件，其中有挖土机、拖拉机的四排链子、高压油泵、行走链子、铜套、活塞、混凝土震动器的软轴、胶皮管等。这些零件，是修理建筑机械的时候经常要用的，过去由于鞍山不会自制，国内又不易买到，许多建筑机械常常因为缺乏一个配件而停工。这十五件重要零件试制成功，对保证机械的正常运转，提高设备的利用系数，将起重大作用。鞍山冶金化学建筑总公司，已经决定拨付两千元奖金，奖励积极参加试制工作的职工。
