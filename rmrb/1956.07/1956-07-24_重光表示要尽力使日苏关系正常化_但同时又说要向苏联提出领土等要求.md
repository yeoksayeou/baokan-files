Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, July 23rd: Japanese Foreign Minister Mamoru Shigemitsu stated in the Diet today that he would conduct negotiations with the Soviet Union according to established policy. He explained that the so-called established policy meant that the purpose of the negotiations was to conclude a peace treaty, but at the same time to demand that the Soviet Union repatriate "detained personnel" and demand that the Soviet Union "return" the Habomai Islands, Shikotan Island, Kunashir Island, and Etorofu Island to Japan.

At the same time, Shigemitsu also stated that he would do his best to ensure that the negotiations achieve the goal of normalizing diplomatic relations between the two countries, and not allow the negotiations to break down.

Shigemitsu was answering questions at a special meeting of the House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee to discuss the issue of Japan-Soviet negotiations. He will lead the Japanese delegation to Moscow on the 25th to resume negotiations with the Soviet Union on the normalization of Japan-Soviet relations.

At today's meeting, the Socialist Party demanded that the Japanese government guarantee that it would not succumb to pressure from the United States in the Japan-Soviet negotiations, but would restore diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union. If a peace treaty cannot be concluded, the "Adenauer formula" should be adopted to sign a temporary agreement to end the state of war between Japan and the Soviet Union and exchange diplomatic envoys.

    重光表示要尽力使日苏关系正常化
    但同时又说要向苏联提出领土等要求
    新华社23日讯　东京消息：日本外务相重光葵今天在国会说，他将按照既定方针同苏联进行谈判。他说明，所谓既定方针就是谈判要以缔结和约为目的，但是同时要求苏联遣返“被扣人员”，并且要求苏联把齿舞群岛、色丹岛、国后岛和择捉岛“归还”日本。
    同时，重光又表示，他要竭尽全力使谈判达到两国邦交正常化的目的，而不使谈判破裂。
    重光是在众议院外务委员会的一次专门讨论日苏谈判问题的会议上答复质询。他将在二十五日率领日本代表团赴莫斯科同苏联恢复举行日苏关系正常化的谈判。
    在今天的会议上，社会党要求日本政府保证在日苏谈判中不屈服于美国的压力，而要同苏联恢复外交关系。如果不能缔结和约，就采取“阿登纳方式”，签订临时协定来结束日苏间的战争状态，互派外交使节。
