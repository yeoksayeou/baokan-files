    The sixth issue of the 1956 "Kommunist" magazine, a theoretical and political journal of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, published a book review by M. Sidorov, reviewing the book "Plekhanov's Philosophical Views" by V. A. Fomina, published by the Soviet State Political Literature Publishing House in 1955. From this book review, we can see that Soviet philosophers are paying attention to overcoming the incorrect attitude towards Plekhanov's philosophical legacy in philosophical circles in recent years.

    Plekhanov's philosophical works constitute an entire era in the history of Russian social thought. Lenin once said that an entire generation of Russian Marxists studied Plekhanov's works. Dialectical and historical materialism, the history of philosophy, ethics, aesthetics – Plekhanov made valuable contributions to all these sciences. Plekhanov's merits in criticizing philosophical revisionism and idealism were particularly great. His theoretical legacy is rich. However, Plekhanov himself was contradictory; on the one hand, he conducted extremely valuable research, and on the other hand, he also held erroneous principles. Lenin gave him due evaluation, while also relentlessly criticizing his political opportunism and his Menshevik errors. However, Lenin never forgot his merits. Lenin often emphasized that in philosophy, Plekhanov defended a just cause.

    When mentioning the attitude of Soviet philosophical circles towards Plekhanov's philosophical legacy in recent years, the book review author stated that insufficient attention has been paid to Lenin's evaluation of Plekhanov's philosophical legacy; until recently, few people studied Plekhanov's philosophical works. Especially in recent years, historians of philosophy have mainly focused their energy on the errors and shortcomings of Plekhanov's works. As a result, there was more criticism than research on Plekhanov. Among Soviet philosophers, the phenomenon of underestimating Plekhanov's philosophical legacy was widespread. People believed that Plekhanov was at most a person who popularized and annotated the works of Marx and Engels. People forgot that Plekhanov was an original researcher in the field of Marxist philosophy.

    The book review author said that Fomina's merit lies in her efforts to overcome those incorrect opinions on many issues and prove the originality of Plekhanov's Marxist writings. After thoroughly studying Plekhanov's theoretical legacy, she wrote a useful book introducing Plekhanov's philosophical views. This book convincingly proves that Plekhanov attached great importance to the theoretical education of the working class; it narrates his views on the regularity of the development of the Russian revolution. The book briefly comments on Plekhanov's work on the role of the masses and individuals in history. This book particularly emphasizes the analysis of Plekhanov's works attacking revisionism. The key chapters of the book, namely chapters four and five, explore Plekhanov's defense, promotion, and argumentation of dialectical materialism and historical materialism during the twenty years from 1883 to 1903. The book emphasizes that Plekhanov was the first to propose in philosophical books that Marx and Engels' creation of dialectical materialism and historical materialism was a revolution in philosophy. The book specifically critically analyzes Plekhanov's concept of the base and superstructure. The book also introduces Plekhanov's views on literature and art. This book touches on all the most important aspects of Plekhanov's theoretical and socio-political activities. The author's task in writing this book was to give a Marxist-Leninist evaluation of Plekhanov's philosophical legacy and point out his great merits as a thinker and politician, as well as his weaknesses. The book review author believes that Fomina basically completed this task, but deviated from objective evaluation in several important places. In many places, Fomina only regarded Plekhanov as a promoter and popularizer of Marxist thought. Plekhanov did a lot of work in discussing several important issues of historical materialism. He made contributions in concretizing and developing Marxism's theories on the role of the masses and individuals in history, the relationship between economics and ideas, and the interrelationships of various forms of social consciousness. The author only briefly touches on all this, as if afraid of overestimating Plekhanov's merits. There is also a major omission in the book, which is the lack of an introduction to Plekhanov's role as a historian of philosophy. Plekhanov was an outstanding researcher in this regard. His analytical methods in the history of philosophy are worthy of in-depth study.

    Finally, the author of the book review said that Fomina put a lot of effort into studying Plekhanov's theoretical legacy and commenting on Plekhanov's original views. She critically analyzed many incorrect views on Plekhanov. She recommends to readers a book that basically correctly elucidates Plekhanov's philosophy, theory, and social activities. However, due to being engrossed in criticizing Plekhanov's shortcomings and weaknesses, she failed to fully elucidate Plekhanov's contributions in arguing for and developing dialectical materialism and historical materialism. The book review author also pointed out that some of the shortcomings in the book should be the responsibility of the State Political Books Publishing House. The publishing house dragged on publishing Fomina's work for five years, during which time the book was subjected to much criticism. In fact, it was forcing the author to accept the erroneous views that were popular at the time.

    重视普列哈诺夫的哲学遗产
    苏联“共产党人”杂志的评论
    苏共中央理论政治刊物“共产党人”杂志1956年第六期，发表了马·西道罗夫的一篇书评，评介了1955年苏联国家政治书籍出版局出版的弗·阿·福米娜著“普列哈诺夫的哲学观点”一书。从这篇书评里，我们看到苏联哲学家在注意克服近年来哲学界对待普列哈诺夫哲学遗产的不正确态度。
    普列哈诺夫的哲学著作，在俄国社会思想史上构成整整一个时代。列宁曾说过，整整一代的俄国马克思主义者都学习过普列哈诺夫的著作。辩证唯物主义和历史唯物主义、哲学史、伦理学、美学，——所有这些科学中，都有普列哈诺夫的宝贵贡献。普列哈诺夫在批评哲学修正主义、唯心主义方面的功绩特别大。他的理论遗产是丰富的。但是，普列哈诺夫本身是矛盾着的，一方面他进行了十分宝贵的研究，另一方面他也有错误的原理。列宁曾经给了他应有的评价，同时也无情地批判过他在政治上的机会主义，以及他的孟什维主义的错误。但是，列宁从来也没有忘记他的功绩。列宁经常强调说，在哲学方面，普列哈诺夫维护了正义的事业。
    书评作者在提到近年来苏联哲学界对普列哈诺夫的哲学遗产的态度时说，人们对于列宁对普列哈诺夫哲学遗产的评价重视不够；直到最近很少有人研究普列哈诺夫的哲学著作。特别是近年来哲学史学者主要是把精力集中在普列哈诺夫著作的错误和缺点方面了。结果是对于普列哈诺夫批评多于研究。在苏联哲学家当中，对于普列哈诺夫哲学遗产估计不足的现象广为流行。人们认为普列哈诺夫最多不过是一个把马克思、恩格斯著作予以通俗化和加以注释的人。人们忘记了，普列哈诺夫是马克思主义哲学领域内有独创性的研究者。
    书评作者说，福米娜的功绩在于她极力在好多问题上克服那些不正确的意见，证明普列哈诺夫所写的马克思主义著作的独创性。她在详尽地研究过普列哈诺夫的理论遗产后，写出了介绍普列哈诺夫哲学观点的有益的著作。这本书令人信服地证明了普列哈诺夫十分重视工人阶级的理论教育；叙述了他对俄国革命发展规律性所持的观点。书中简略地评论了普列哈诺夫关于人民群众和个人在历史上作用问题的著作。这本书特别重视分析普列哈诺夫攻击修正主义的那些著作。这本书的重点章次，即四、五两章探讨了普列哈诺夫在1883—1903年这二十年间保卫、宣传和论证辩证唯物主义和历史唯物主义。书中着重提到，普列哈诺夫第一个在哲学书籍中提出马克思、恩格斯创立辩证唯物主义和历史唯物主义是哲学中的革命。这本书专门批判地分析了普列哈诺夫对基础和上层建筑的观念。这本书还介绍了普列哈诺夫对文学、艺术的观点。这本书涉及了普列哈诺夫的理论和社会政治活动的一切最重要方面。作者写这本书的任务就是要对普列哈诺夫哲学遗产给以马克思列宁主义的评价，并指出他做为一个思想家和政治家的巨大功绩以及他的弱点。书评作者认为，福米娜基本上完成了这个任务，但是在若干重要的地方，脱离了客观的评价。福米娜在好多地方只是把普列哈诺夫看作马克思主义思想的宣传者和通俗化者。普列哈诺夫对于研讨历史唯物主义的若干重要问题，作了很多工作。他在把马克思主义关于人民群众和个人在历史上的作用、经济和思想的关系、社会意识各种形态的相互关系的学说加以具体化和发展方面，是有功绩的。关于这一切，作者只是轻描淡写，好像害怕把普列哈诺夫的功绩评得过高了似的。书中还有一个重大的疏漏，就是没有介绍普列哈诺夫作为哲学史学家的作用。普列哈诺夫在这方面是一位杰出的研究者。他的哲学史的分析方法值得深刻研究。
    最后，书评的作者说，福米娜在研究普列哈诺夫的理论遗产，以及评论普列哈诺夫观点的原著，用了很多工夫。她批判地分析了许多对普列哈诺夫的不正确看法。她把这样一本基本上正确地阐明普列哈诺夫的哲学、理论、社会活动的著作推荐给读者。但是由于醉心于批评普列哈诺夫的缺点和弱点，她就没能充分地阐明普列哈诺夫在论证和发展辩证唯物主义和历史唯物主义方面的贡献。书评作者又指出，书中的某些缺点是应由国家政治书籍出版局负责。出版局把福米娜的著作一直拖了五年才出版，在这当中这本书遭到了许多批评，事实上就是硬要作者接受当时广为流行的错误见解。
