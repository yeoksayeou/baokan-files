    Xinhua News Agency, Rome, July 15th: The Italian government released on the 14th the Italian Prime Minister Segni's reply to Bulganin on the disarmament issue. Bulganin wrote to Segni in June suggesting that countries promote international disarmament by taking practical measures to reduce their own armaments.
    In his reply, Segni reiterated the Western argument, emphasizing that an international disarmament agreement providing for "effective supervision" should be reached. Segni linked the resolution of some international political issues to the issue of disarmament, in this regard, he specifically mentioned "the issue of German reunification." At the same time, Segni pointed out in his letter that easing international tensions is a prerequisite for reaching a general disarmament agreement.

    意总理复信给布尔加宁
    他认为缓和局势是普遍裁军的先决条件
    新华社15日讯　罗马消息：意大利政府在十四日发表了意大利总理塞尼就裁军问题写给布尔加宁的复信。布尔加宁曾在六月间写给塞尼的信里建议，各国以裁减自己的军备的实际措施来促进国际裁军。
    塞尼在复信中重复西方的论点，强调应当达成一项规定“有效的监督”的国际裁军协定。塞尼把一些国际政治问题的解决同裁军问题联系起来，在这方面，他特别提到“德国统一问题”。塞尼同时在信里指出，缓和国际紧张局势是达成普遍裁军协议的先决条件。
