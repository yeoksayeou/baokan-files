　　Wenzhou—Shanghai
　　Successful Sea Towing of Timber Rafts
　　Xinhua News Agency dispatch: The sea towing of timber rafts on the Wenzhou-Shanghai shipping line has been successful. The first batch of over 2,000 cubic meters of fir and pine wood produced in Zhejiang was towed to Shanghai on the 29th by the "Production No. 1" tugboat.
　　The waterway from Wenzhou to Shanghai is particularly winding, with rapid currents and many hidden reefs on both sides. The tugboat crew members constantly calculated the direction and speed of the sea tides, grasped the correct navigation direction, and enabled the large timber raft, which was eighty meters long and thirteen meters wide, to pass smoothly through the seven narrow waterways between the coastal islands and safely arrive in Shanghai.
　　In the past, timber from Wenzhou to Shanghai was transported by ships. When ships were busy transporting other goods, the timber produced in abundance in southern Zhejiang could not be shipped out in time, affecting the supply of timber to Shanghai.
　　Prior to this, the sea towing of timber rafts on the Dalian-Shanghai shipping line had already been successful. From May 1954 to the present, a large amount of timber towed from Dalian to Shanghai has saved more than 340,000 yuan in freight costs alone.

### 温州——上海  海上拖运木排成功

      温州——上海
      海上拖运木排成功
    据新华社讯　温州—上海海运线上拖运木排成功。第一批二千多立方公尺浙江出产的杉木和松木，二十九日由“生产一号”拖轮拖到了上海。
    从温州到上海，航道特别曲折，水流湍急，两旁暗礁又多。拖轮的船员们随时测算海上潮水的流向和流速，掌握正确的航运方向，使拖运的长八十公尺，宽十三公尺的大木排，顺利地在沿海群岛之间的七个狭水道中穿过，安全到达上海。
    过去，从温州到上海的木材都用轮船装运，在轮船忙于运输其他货物的时候，浙江南部盛产的木材就不能及时运出，影响上海木材的供应。
    在这以前，大连—上海海运线上拖运木排已经成功。从1954年5月到现在，从大连拖运到上海的大批木材，仅运费就节约了三十四万多元。
