　　At the foot of the Nanshan Mountain in Huaxian County, Shaanxi Province, there is a large green orchard, which is the production area of the famous "Huazhou Apricot" in Shaanxi. There are more than 100,000 large apricot trees growing here, and they bear so many apricots that there are more than 30 apricots on a two-foot-long branch. This year, this apricot orchard has already produced 270,000 catties of fresh apricots, and it is estimated that it can also produce 160,000 catties of apricot kernels and 750,000 catties of dried apricots, with a total output about four times higher than last year. According to Gu Yishan, an 84-year-old man, this is the first bumper harvest in decades.
　　There are many varieties of Huaxian apricots, including Zhi apricot, Red Silver apricot, Rouge apricot, Peach apricot, Late Bangzi, Kalarala, White Sand apricot, Yizi apricot, Horse apricot, Plum apricot, and Sugar Jar, some of which are sold to Tianjin, Shanghai, Lanzhou, Guangzhou and other places. Nearly 2,000 farmers in this area are engaged in apricot tree cultivation, and apricots are a significant source of income for farmers.
　　Before liberation, the sales of apricots and apricot kernels here were poor, and three catties of apricot kernels only sold for the price of one catty of apricot kernels today. Many dried apricots and apricot kernels could not be sold, and the fruit farmers could only watch them rot. Some even cut down apricot trees out of spite. After liberation, the farmers had the incentive to manage them.
　　In 1955, Soviet agricultural expert Comrade Vasilyev visited the Huaxian Apricot Orchard area. He offered many suggestions to local fruit farmers on methods of fertilizing, preventing frost, pruning, and preventing pests in cultivating fruit trees. These advanced experiences have played a significant role in the cultivation of apricot trees.
　　In the early winter of last year, the fruit farmers launched a campaign to accumulate and apply fertilizer to the fruit trees. They applied more than 2.1 billion catties of fertilizer to the orchards and also built a three-foot-wide dam on the Shidi River. This spring, they also carried out pest control in a timely manner, ensuring the bumper harvest of apricots. (Hu Yutian)

    华州杏大丰收
    陕西省华县南山脚下，有一大片丛绿的果林，这就是陕西著名的“华州杏”产地。这里生长着十多万棵大杏树，杏子结得多极了，一个二尺长的树枝上就有三十多个杏子。今年这片杏林，已经生产了二十七万斤鲜杏，预计还可以生产十六万斤杏仁和七十五万斤杏干，总产量约可高出去年四倍。据八十四岁的老人顾熠山说，这是几十年来的第一次大丰收。
    华县杏的种类很多，有质杏、红银杏、胭脂杏、桃杏、迟梆子、喀拉拉、白沙杏、遗子杏、马杏、梅子杏、糖罐罐等，有些远销到天津、上海、兰州、广州等地。这一带有近二千户农民经营杏树，杏子是农民一笔很大的收入。
    解放以前，这里的杏子和杏仁销路不好，三斤杏仁只卖今天一斤杏仁的价钱。很多杏干和杏仁卖不出去，果农们只好眼巴巴的看着它们霉坏。有些甚至赌气把杏树砍了。解放后农民才有了经营的兴趣。
    1955年苏联农业专家华西列夫同志曾到华县杏林区参观。他对当地果农施肥、防霜、整枝、防虫等培育果树的方法，提了不少意见。这些先进的经验，对杏树的培育起了很大作用。
    去年冬初，果农们展开给果树积肥、施肥运动，他们把二十一多亿斤肥料施到果园里，还在石堤河上修了一条三丈宽的拦河坝；今年春季，又及时进行了除虫，保证了杏子的丰收。　（胡玉田）
