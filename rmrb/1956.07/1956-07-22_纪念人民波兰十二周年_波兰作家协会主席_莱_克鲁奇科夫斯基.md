    Commemorating the Twelfth Anniversary of People's Poland
    Chairman of the Polish Writers' Association, Lai·Kruchkovsky

    This year, the Polish people will celebrate the twelfth anniversary of what constitutes a turning point in Poland's modern history. On July 22, 1944, on the land east of the Vistula River in Poland, liberated by the Soviet army, the Polish Committee of National Liberation, representing the democratic forces fighting against the occupiers, issued a declaration. This declaration stipulated the main national principles of the new Poland and heralded revolutionary social reforms.

    Like every true revolutionary document, its contents soon began to be realized. As the battlefront moved forward and in the bloody struggle against domestic reactionary gangs, the provisions for distributing the land of landlords to peasants and handing over factories to workers were implemented. The glorious Soviet army defended our country from open armed intervention by imperialist forces, which had severely affected our politics and economy in the past few decades. It was also due to this victory of the Soviet army that the old territories that originally belonged to our country were returned to Poland. This part of the territory has been inseparably linked to Poland since the founding of the nation. Today, the Oder River has become one of the most important rivers in Europe, serving as a peaceful border between Poland and Germany.

    It is not surprising that the July anniversary has become a festival for the people of the new Poland. Every year, the anniversary allows us to examine the work we have completed and the extent to which the principles of the declaration have been realized in our country and our lives. Each anniversary has a unique face, clearly showing the latest achievements in our country's development. For example, four years ago, on this day in 1952, the Constitution of People's Poland was adopted. This event added special brilliance to the festival. In other years, this anniversary has also been closely linked to the completion of our great projects in our capital and elsewhere.

    The Polish people are preparing to greet the twelfth anniversary this year in a completely different atmosphere than in previous years. Because the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union is regarded as a very important historical event in all countries of the socialist camp. This event has great significance for the future lives of the people of all countries building socialism. Its results extend to all departments of life: political and economic, moral and cultural. The restoration of the Leninist principles of Party life also involves the entire social and national life in our country. According to the Leninist principles of the Party, all work should be carried out through a critical evaluation of the methods of building a socialist country and a new socialist society. Issues such as leadership methods, guaranteeing the people's practical influence on the economy and administration, and effective supervision of state organs should also be improved through mass discussions. The most obvious manifestation of these changes is the active work of our National Assembly. The role and prestige of the parliament have greatly increased since the recent meeting to discuss the national budget. It can also be said that people's congresses at all levels have become more active than before. The role of trade unions and all workers in enterprises is growing. Some newly issued instructions and decrees from the Party and the government have decided to gradually decentralize the power of the central government to plan and lead production in all aspects of our lives and in various sectors of the economy.

    At the same time, the entire process of eliminating shortcomings and errors in our lives has been vividly reflected in our various newspapers and periodicals. The reasons for the errors that existed in the past twelve years are, to no small extent, due to the ideological approach itself. A dogmatic understanding of the laws of social development and the excessive importance attached to propaganda and its influence have all led to a neglect of the reality of life. After changing formalism and eulogistic optimism, our newspapers and periodicals have become vigorous factors in activating thought and truly mobilizing public opinion.

    Naturally, while we fully affirm the sound significance of this great process of change, we have not for a minute overlooked the possibility that forces currently hostile to us may attempt to undermine our struggle to restore Leninist norms. Reactionaries first want to stir up nationalist sentiments, the obvious aim of which is to weaken the friendship between our people and the countries of the great socialist camp, especially the fraternal peoples of the Soviet Union. But today, all such tricks will meet with greater failure than ever before. Because the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union has created new conditions for the further development of the friendship between the people of all countries building the socialist system and the friendly alliance with the peoples of the Soviet Union and the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.

    Finally, it is impossible not to see the scale and effectiveness with which the peaceful diplomacy of the countries of the socialist camp has been carried out since the 20th Congress of the CPSU. In particular, the activism of the Soviet state leaders has aroused the respect and welcome of hundreds of millions of peace advocates in the world. We also realize the great significance of the strong economic and cultural development of the People's Republic of China for consolidating the cause of peace.

    The progress of international relations and the process of sound domestic relations will undoubtedly be reflected in this year's celebration of the Polish people's festival. The work of strictly liquidating the errors that occurred in the past years has not ended. However, the ways to overcome these errors are already clearly seen, and we have already taken several decisive steps on this road. This road can bring us much closer to realizing the goals put forward by the Polish government in the declaration of July 22, 1944, twelve years ago. The main ones have been fully realized, but there are many that we have not given them their due significance in the past twelve years. We have clearly seen the essence of the problem and maturely understood the truth that the future society must not only grow in the constant struggle against poverty, oppression, and material scarcity, but also in the constant struggle against ideological stagnation, spiritual dullness, the decline of creative criticism, and the insincere expressions in our lives. Nothing can erase this truth from the banner of our Polish United Workers' Party, which is leading the people to overcome various difficulties and move towards socialism.

    纪念人民波兰十二周年
    波兰作家协会主席　莱·克鲁奇科夫斯基
    今年，波兰人民将第十二次庆祝作为波兰现代历史转折点的周年纪念日。1944年7月22日，在由苏军所解放的波兰维斯杜拉河以东的土地上，波兰民族解放委员会代表着同占领者进行斗争的人民民主力量，发布了宣言。这个宣言规定了新波兰的主要的国家原则，预示了革命的社会改革。
    像每一个真正的革命文件一样，这个文件的内容没有多久就开始实现了。随着战线的推移以及在同国内反动派匪帮的流血斗争中，就实现了把地主的土地分配给农民，把工厂交给工人接管的规定。光荣的苏军保卫我们国家免受帝国主义势力公开的武装干涉，而在过去几十年内，帝国主义势力曾经严重地影响过我国的政治和经济。也是由于苏军的这个胜利，原来属于我国的旧领土又归还了波兰。这部分领土是从波兰立国之初就同它不可分割地联系着的。而今天，奥德河成了欧洲最重要的河流之一，它是波兰和德国之间的和平国界。
    七月纪念日之成为新波兰人民的节日是并不奇怪的。每一年的纪念日都使我们能够检查我们所完成的工作，检查宣言的原则在我国和我们的生活中实现的程度如何。每一个周年纪念日都有独特的面貌，都清楚地显示出我国发展过程中所获得的最新的成就。例如，在四年前，1952年的这一天通过了人民波兰的宪法。这件事给这个节日增添了特别的光辉。在别的年份，这个纪念日也都同我们在我国首都和其他地方的伟大工程的完工密切联系着。
    波兰人民今年完全是在与往年不同的气氛中来准备迎接第十二周年纪念日的。因为，苏联共产党第二十次代表大会在社会主义阵营的所有国家中都被看作是一件非常重要的历史事件。这个事件对于正在建设社会主义的各国人民的未来生活有着巨大的意义。它的结果扩及到生活的一切部门：政治的和经济的、道德的和文化的。恢复党的生活的列宁原则，这在我国也涉及到整个社会和国家生活。按照党的列宁主义的原则，一切工作要通过对建设社会主义国家和新的社会主义社会的方法的批判评价来进行。关于领导方法，关于保证人民群众对经济和行政的实际影响和对国家机关的有效监督等问题，也要通过群众性的讨论来加以改进。这些改变中最明显的表现是我们国民议会工作的活跃。议会的作用和威信，从讨论国家预算的最近一次会议开始起，大大地提高了。也可以说各级人民会议已比以前更加发挥主动性了。企业中的工会和全体工人的作用在增长着。党和政府新发布的一些指示和法令，决定有步骤地使中央对我国生活各方面和经济各部门的计划和领导生产的权力分向地方。
    同时，消除我们生活中的缺点和错误的整个过程，也在我们的各种报刊上得到了生动的反应。过去十二年中存在的错误的原因，在不小的程度上是从思想方法本身所造成的。对社会发展法则的教条主义的理解，对宣传及其影响赋予了过分的意义，这一切都造成了对于生活现实的忽视。在改变了公式主义和歌功颂德的乐观主义以后，我们的报刊就变成为使思想积极化和真正动员舆论的生气勃勃的因素。
    自然，在我们完全肯定这个伟大变革过程的健全的意义时，我们一分钟也没有忽视这样的可能，即在目前与我们敌对的力量企图破坏我们为恢复列宁主义准则的斗争的可能。反动派首先想煽起民族主义的情绪，其明显的目的是在削弱我国人民同伟大的社会主义阵营各国，首先是同兄弟般的苏联各族人民的友谊。但在今天，所有这类伎俩比任何时候都会遭到更大的失败。因为苏联共产党第二十次代表大会为进一步发展建设社会主义制度的各国人民之间的友谊，发展同苏联各族人民和苏联共产党之间的友好同盟，创造了新的条件。
    最后，不能不看到在苏共第二十次代表大会以后社会主义阵营各国的和平外交以怎样的规模和成效在开展起来。特别是苏联国家领导人的积极性，引起了世界上亿万和平拥护者的尊敬和欢迎。我们也意识到中华人民共和国强大的经济和文化发展对巩固和平事业的重大意义。
    国际关系的进展和国内关系健全化的过程，无疑将在今年庆祝波兰人民节日时反映出来。严格清算过去年代所发生的错误的工作，并没有结束。但是，已经很明显地看出了克服这些错误的途径，而且在这条路上我们已经作了决定性的几个步骤了。这条道路可以使我们大大接近实现波兰政府在十二年前——1944年7月22日的宣言中所提出的目的。其中主要的已经完全实现了，不过有许多我们在过去十二年期间没有赋予它们应有的意义。我们已明确地看到问题的实质，成熟地理解到这样的真理：未来的社会不仅要在同贫困、压迫和物质匮乏的不断斗争中成长，而且也要在同思想的停滞、精神上的迟钝、创造性批评的衰落和我们生活中的不真挚的表现的不断斗争中成长。无论什么东西也不可能从我们波兰统一工人党的旗帜上抹掉这个真理，我们波兰党正在领导人民克服各种困难，走向社会主义。（本报特约稿）
