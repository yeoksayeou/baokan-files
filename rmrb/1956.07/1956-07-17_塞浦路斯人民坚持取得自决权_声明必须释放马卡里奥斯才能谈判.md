Xinhua News Agency, Nicosia, 16th: Radcliffe, the "constitutional commissioner" sent by the British to Cyprus, arrived in Cyprus on July 14th.

    An official statement said that Radcliffe's purpose in coming is to have extensive contact with all sectors of Cypriot society to negotiate the drafting of the so-called Cypriot "constitution." The British government, refusing to allow the people of Cyprus to exercise self-determination, intends to ease the resistance of local residents by negotiating a "constitution."

    On the 15th, many Cypriot organizations of workers, farmers, intellectuals, and educators, as well as some religious groups, expressed the same attitude. In statements issued or letters to Radcliffe, they stated that they would refuse to negotiate if the exiled Cypriot religious leader Makarios was not released. They once again demanded that the residents of Cyprus be given the right to self-determination.

    塞浦路斯人民坚持取得自决权
    声明必须释放马卡里奥斯才能谈判
    据新华社16日讯　尼科西亚消息：英国派到塞浦路斯来的“宪法专员”拉德克利夫，已经在七月十四日到达塞浦路斯。
    官方发表的声明说，拉德克利夫此行的目的是要同塞浦路斯各界进行广泛接触，谈判起草所谓塞浦路斯“宪法”的问题。拒绝让塞浦路斯人民实行自决的英国政府打算通过谈判“宪法”的办法来缓和当地居民的反抗。
    十五日，塞浦路斯的许多工人、农民、文教界人士的组织和一些宗教团体也都先后表示了同样的态度。它们在发表的声明或给拉德克利夫的信中都表示：如果不把被流放的塞浦路斯宗教领袖马卡里奥斯放回来，他们就拒绝谈判。他们再一次要求给塞浦路斯居民以自决权。
