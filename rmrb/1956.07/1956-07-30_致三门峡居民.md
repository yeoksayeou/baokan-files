To the Residents of Sanmenxia,

For generations, you, Ran Bing, have lived by the Yellow River, the waters of which have nurtured you. Today, filled with a lofty ideal, you are all leaving your homes. The elderly bid farewell to their centuries-old houses in tears, repeatedly stroking the bean trellises and melon vines in front of their houses. But what is there to regret in all this? You will have better homes and more robust crops. Go to the vast Gobi Desert to plant grapes, and to the foothills of the Yin Mountains to graze cattle and horses. Lead the snowmelt from the Tianshan Mountains to irrigate fertile fields, and subdue the wind and sand of the Loess Plateau. Twenty years from now, when you revisit your old home, everything there will amaze you: the old valleys will be surging with vast waves, and Renmen, Guimen, and Shenmen will all be imprisoned underwater. Carp will no longer worry about leaping over the Dragon Gate, and ships will stir up waves beside the mountain peaks. The divine craftsmanship of Yu the Great failed to cleave the dangerous shoals and rocks, but we can swallow them in one gulp. Miraculous deeds can be encountered everywhere, not just that enormous dam! At night, millions of electric lights will dazzle your eyes, and the coal smoke from the factories will make you mistake it for clouds emerging from the mountains. Where were the original beaches and steep cliffs? You will give every tourist a satisfactory answer to their questions because you are old residents of the Yellow River, after all! You once lived in this world-renowned Sanmenxia. (Attached Image)

    致三门峡居民　　
    然冰祖祖辈辈居住在黄河边，黄河里的水把你们养大；今天，怀着一个崇高的理想，你们一齐离开了自己的家。老年人挥泪和百年老屋告别，一次次抚摸屋前的豆棚瓜架。这一切又有什么可惋惜的呢？你们将会有更好的住宅，更茁
  壮的庄稼。到大戈壁去种植葡萄，到阴山山麓去放牧牛马；引天山的雪水灌溉良田，降服黄土高原的风沙。二十年后再来重游故园，那儿的一切都会叫你惊讶：旧日的山谷激荡着万顷波涛，人门、鬼门、神门全都幽禁在
  水底下。鲤鱼再也不愁跳不过龙门，轮船在山峰旁激起浪花。大禹的鬼斧没能劈掉险滩乱
  石，我们能把它一口吞下。神奇的事迹到处都可以碰到，岂只是那硕大无比的拦河坝？夜里，千万盏电灯会耀花你的
  眼睛，工厂的煤烟会叫你错当作出岫
  的云霞。哪儿是原来的沙滩、陡崖，你对每个游人的疑问都给以满
  意的解答。因为你是黄河两岸的老居民
  呵！曾经住在这举世闻名的三门
  峡。（附图片）
