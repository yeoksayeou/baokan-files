		A Wolf in Sheep's Clothing
	The Swiss "Journal de Genève" published an article by its correspondent in the United States on June 7, stating that the United States "is preparing to offer Morocco a 'pioneering' loan" and "to conclude a mutual assistance treaty with Morocco." It is said that one of the motives for the United States to do so is "the noble and sincere ideal of striving for the liberation of colonial peoples," so it "would rather deal with newly independent, resource-poor countries than with old 'colonial' countries."
	It would be too naive to think that the gentlemen in Washington really have some noble sympathy for the colonial people and are therefore extending a hand of friendship to this young independent North African country. The "Journal de Genève" article immediately revealed the true motive for this American approach - "very clear vested interests." To be more specific: "Since Arab countries like Morocco can only provide mineral resources—mainly oil—the United States, as a country that produces cars and airplanes, is naturally concerned about these countries; and since these countries cannot produce soda or mechanical pens, it is natural for American industrialists to go there to find markets." The article also said: "Americans, who are always looking for new 'borders'," want to use investment to turn these countries "into markets for American cars, road rollers, refrigerators, and non-alcoholic beverages."
	It turns out that what the gentlemen in Washington are extending to the Moroccan people is not a hand of friendship, but a greedy claw. The "Journal de Genève" article mentioned this claw's plan: to exchange five hundred million dollars in "pioneering" loans for five military bases in Morocco and "guarantees of certain economic interests," and to prepare Morocco to join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization through a so-called "mutual assistance treaty," thereby ensuring the protection of Morocco—and its bases."
	Although the "Journal de Genève" article described "the ideal of striving for the liberation of colonial peoples" as a "sincere" motive for the United States' negotiations with Morocco, it is easier for people to associate it with the ancient fable of "the wolf in sheep's clothing." The Moroccan people, who have already achieved independence through their heroic struggle, are not dealing with the evil wolf of colonialism for the first time. Although the American wolf has an extra sheepskin coat, they can still hear the wolf's voice from the disguised ewe's tone and will give its claws the punishment they deserve. (Yuan)

    披着羊皮的狼
    瑞士“日内瓦日报”在六月七日发表的一篇驻美国记者写的文章里说，美国“正准备提供摩洛哥一笔‘开创’贷款”，并且“同摩洛哥缔结一个互助条约”。据说，美国这样做的动机之一是“争取殖民地人民解放的高贵而真诚的理想”，因此它“宁可同新独立的资源贫乏的国家打交道，而不愿意同古老的‘殖民’国家打交道”。
    如果认为华盛顿的老爷们真是对殖民地人民有了什么高贵的同情，因而向北非这个年轻的独立国家伸出了友谊的手，那就未免太天真了。“日内瓦日报”的这篇文章紧接着就透露了美国这种做法的真正动机——“很明确的利害关系”。说得具体一些就是：由于像摩洛哥这样的“阿拉伯国家只能提供矿产资源——主要是石油，因此生产汽车和飞机的国家美国当然关心这些国家；又由于这些国家既不能生产汽水又不能生产机械式的钢笔，所以美国工业家到那里去寻找市场也是很自然的。”文章还说：“始终在寻找新‘边界’的美国人”，想以投资的办法来把这些国家“变成美国汽车，压路机、冰箱和非酒精饮料的市场”。
    原来，华盛顿的老爷们向摩洛哥人民伸出的并不是什么友谊的手，而是一只贪婪的魔爪。“日内瓦日报”的这篇文章里就提到了这只魔爪的打算：用五亿美元的“开创”贷款来换取在摩洛哥的五个军事基地和“某些经济利益的保证”，并且通过一个所谓“互助条约”来准备摩洛哥加入北大西洋公约组织，从而保证对摩洛哥——以及它的基地——的保护。”
    尽管“日内瓦日报”的这篇文章把“争取殖民地人民解放的理想”说成是美国同摩洛哥谈判的一个“真诚”的动机，但是人们更容易联想起来的是“披着羊皮的狼”这个古老的寓言。已经用自己英勇斗争取得独立的摩洛哥人民并不是第一次同殖民主义的恶狼打交道，虽然美国狼多一张羊皮外衣，但是他们还是能够从那假装的母羊声调中听出狼的嗓音，并会给它的爪子以应有的打击。　（元）
