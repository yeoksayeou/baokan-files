Xinhua News Agency, Muztagh, July 8th (Xinhua Correspondent Yang Kexian): The Sino-Soviet joint mountaineering team had completely established all base camps at Tegan Bulak, southwest of Muztagh Ata, by the 7th.

	That morning, as the sun shone on the snow-covered peaks of Muztagh Ata, the cold night in the high mountains quickly disappeared. The base camp at the foot of the mountain began to heat up under the sun's radiation. When the entire team got up for their morning exercises, they were even wearing only undershirts. The base camp is 4,060 meters above sea level. However, for the Chinese and Soviet mountaineers who had just climbed Europe's highest peak, Mount Elbrus, they rarely felt any different here than on flat ground.

	The leader of the Sino-Soviet joint mountaineering team, Soviet Honored Master of Sports Berezutsky, read out the congratulatory telegram from the All-China Federation of Trade Unions to all the team members today, and issued the order to establish the camp. All the team members then busied themselves, dividing the work and cooperating, counting supplies, building the kitchen, dining hall, and broadcasting room, setting up the diesel generator, clearing the stubborn rocks in front of the tents, and building roads leading to the river. At this time, the Chinese and Soviet cinematographers were also busy filming. By about 7 p.m., Soviet music and Urumqi broadcasts were coming from the loudspeakers.

	Many Chinese and Soviet athletes were satisfied with the camp they had built through a day of hard work. They called the leveled land in front of the twenty-four tents "Moscow's Red Square," and the road carved out of the stubborn rocks "Beijing's Chang'an Avenue." To prevent dust from entering the tents, they also laid a layer of gravel outside the tents.

	Night fell to the sound of music, and more than forty Chinese and Soviet mountaineers and staff members entered the newly built dining hall together to have dinner under the electric lights. Captain Berezutsky spoke, thanking the athletes for their hard work during the day. He said that the smooth establishment of the base camp has laid a solid foundation for the mountaineering work.

	Tegan Bulak is no more than ten kilometers from the nearest glacier on Muztagh Ata, with abundant water sources, suitable for establishing a mountaineering base camp. The eight tons of supplies brought by the Sino-Soviet joint mountaineering team from the Soviet Union were also picked up from the Sino-Soviet border by the Chinese transport team on the 6th and transported to the base camp.

    中苏混合爬山队宿营基地全部建立好了
    据新华社慕士塔格8日电　新华社记者杨克现报道：中、苏混合爬山队七日已在慕士塔格峰西南的特干布拉克全部建立起了宿营基地。
    这天早晨，当阳光照射到积雪皑皑的慕士塔格山峰时，高山的寒夜便迅速消失了。山脚下的宿营基地在阳光辐射下，开始转热。全体队员起来作健身早操时，甚至只穿了紧身衬衣。宿营基地拔海四千零六十公尺。但是对于刚刚爬过欧洲最高峰—厄尔布鲁士山峰的中、苏爬山运动员来说，他们很少感到在这里和平地上有什么异样。
    中、苏混合爬山队队长，苏联功勋运动员比列次基在今天向全体队员宣读了中华全国总工会的贺电，并且发布了建立营地的命令。全体队员便忙碌起来，他们分工合作，清点物资，搭盖厨房、饭厅和播音室，架起了柴油发电机，清除了帐篷前的顽石，修筑了通向河边的道路。这时，中、苏两国的电影摄影师也忙着拍摄电影。到下午七时光景，播音器就传出了苏联的音乐和乌鲁木齐的广播。
    许多中、苏运动员对于他们一天中辛勤劳动建立起来的营地感到满意。他们把二十四顶帐篷前面修平的土地叫做“莫斯科红场”，把从顽石开辟出来的道路叫做“北京长安街”。为了防止灰尘侵入帐篷，他们还在帐篷外铺上了一层碎石子。
    夜幕在音乐声中降临，四十多名中、苏爬山运动员和工作人员一起走进新修的饭厅，在电灯光下共进晚餐。比列次基队长讲话，感谢运动员一日辛苦的劳动。他说，由于宿营地顺利地建立起来，已经为爬山工作打下了一定的基础。
    特干布拉克离慕士塔格山最近的冰河不过十公里，有着充足的水源，适宜建立爬山宿营基地。中、苏混合爬山队由苏联运来的八吨重的物资，六日也由中国运输队从中、苏边境接运到宿营基地。
