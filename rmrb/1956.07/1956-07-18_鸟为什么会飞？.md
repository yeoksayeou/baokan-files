Why Do Birds Fly?
Zhang Jiaying

The monkey had been troubled for a long time. It thought, "How can I fly? Why do birds fly?" It always squatted on the tree, staring blankly at the birds in the sky, but never found an answer.

Finally, it decided to consult Mr. Fox, a scholar in the forest.

When the monkey met the fox, it originally wanted to humbly express its thoughts and ask the fox for advice. But it was afraid that if it said it, the fox would ridicule its ignorance. So it rolled its red eyes and said:

"Mr. Fox, you are a scholar in the forest, please tell me, why do birds fly?"

"This question is not difficult to answer," the fox replied calmly. "However, I would like to hear your opinion first."

"I asked you first!" the monkey couldn't hold back. "You should speak first!"

The fox said very calmly, "Don't be impatient, science doesn't allow impatience. You talk first, maybe it's not comprehensive, and then I'll add to it, wouldn't that be good?"

"You speak first!"

"No, you speak first!"

The fox and the monkey insisted on their own opinions. The monkey had a flash of inspiration: "I know, it must be that you don't know, you're afraid of saying something wrong, so you don't dare to say it..." After the monkey provoked him with words, it saw that the fox was still unmoved, and said calmly:

"Humph! I don't know? I just don't want to tell you!"

In the end, they had to part unhappily. When the monkey walked away, the little fox asked, "Dad, why do birds fly?"

The old fox said angrily:

"How would I know? I'm not a bird!"

    鸟为什么会飞？
    张家英
    猴子苦恼很久了，它想：“我怎样能飞起来呢？鸟为什么会飞？”它总蹲在树上，呆呆地望着天上的飞鸟，但总没有答案。
    最后，它决定还是去请教请教林中学者狐狸先生。
    猴子见到狐狸，本来想谦逊地说出自己的心事，向狐狸请教。但又怕说出口，被狐狸讥笑自己无知。于是它把红眼珠一转说：
    “狐狸先生，您是林中的学者，请您告诉我，鸟为什么会飞呢？”
    “这问题不难解答。”狐狸沉着地回答：“不过，我想先听听你的意见。”
    “是我先问你的呀！”猴子沉不住气了：“该你先说吗！”
    狐狸十分镇静地说：“别急躁，科学是不允许急躁的，你先讲讲，也许讲得不全面，然后，我再补充补充，不好吗？”
    “你先讲！”
    “不，还是你先讲！”
    狐狸和猴子都坚持自己的意见。猴子急中生智：“我知道了，一定是您不知道，怕讲错了，不敢讲……。”猴子用话激他之后，但见狐狸还不动声色，不慌不忙地说：
    “哼！我不知道？我才不愿意告诉你呢！”
    它们最后只好不欢而散了。在猴子走远了的时候，小狐狸问：“爸爸，鸟为什么会飞呢？”
    老狐狸气愤地说：
    “我怎么知道？我又不是鸟！”
