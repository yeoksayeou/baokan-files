Xinhua News Agency, July 20th Dispatch from Tripoli: According to TASS, the Benghazi newspaper "Al Zaman" published an article: "Libyans have lost faith in the 'Point Four Program'." The article stated that the newspaper's editorial department had received many letters.

The newspaper pointed out that the letters raised many questions, from which only one conclusion could be drawn: the implementing agency of the "Point Four Program" is merely a political organization serving American interests. "Al Zaman" wrote, "Other countries that pay attention to the activities of this organization and study American policy also unanimously believe that the 'Point Four Program' is a tool serving the interests of a small group of military personnel and leaders of both the Democratic and Republican parties in the United States. They use this tool to consolidate the foundation of American imperialism in the Middle East and make the people of various countries in this region submit to the policies of the White House, which aim to make the United States rule over the people of various countries who have only recently escaped the oppression of European imperialists."

"Al Zaman" finally pointed out that the assistance provided by the "Point Four Program" is nominal and emphasized that this kind of "assistance" brings great danger to Libya.

    利比亚“时代报”揭露
    “第四点计划”给利比亚带来很大危险
    据新华社20日讯　据塔斯社的黎波里十九日讯：班加西“时代报”刊登一篇文章：“利比亚人失去了对‘第四点计划’的信任”。文章中说，这家报纸编辑部收到许多来信。
    这家报纸指出，信中提出了许多问题，从这些问题中仅仅可以得出一个结论，就是“第四点计划”的执行机构只是为美国利益服务的政治组织罢了。“时代报”写道，“其他国家注意这一组织的活动和研究美国政策的人也都一致认为，‘第四点计划’是为一小撮军人和美国民主党和共和党两党领导者的利益服务的工具。他们利用这一工具来巩固美国帝国主义在中东的基础，使这一地区的各国人民服从白宫的政策，这个政策的目的是使美国统治不久前刚挣脱欧洲帝国主义者压迫的各国人民。”
    “时代报”最后指出了“第四点计划”提供的援助是有名无实的，并且强调指出这种“援助”给利比亚带来很大的危险。
