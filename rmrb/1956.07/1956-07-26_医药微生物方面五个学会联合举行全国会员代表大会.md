Xinhua News Agency, July 23rd: The National Member Representative Conference jointly held by the Chinese Medical Association, the Chinese Pharmaceutical Association, the Chinese Physiological Society, the Chinese Microbiological Society, and the Chinese Anatomical Society opened in Beijing today.

The matters to be discussed at this conference are: how to better carry out academic activities in accordance with the policy of "Letting a Hundred Flowers Bloom and a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend," how to assist health administrative departments in strengthening scientific research, how to further strengthen unity—especially the unity between traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine and the acceptance of the heritage of traditional Chinese medicine, and how to strengthen international cultural exchange and friendly cooperation.

The members of the five societies have submitted a total of 1,547 academic papers to the conference, some of which will be read at the meeting. These papers are all works after liberation. Having so many academic papers in six or seven years is unprecedented in the medical, pharmaceutical, and microbiological fields. Among them, there are more than fifty academic papers on traditional Chinese medicine.

Among the 632 representatives attending the conference, 110 are representatives from the fields of traditional Chinese medicine and Chinese herbal medicine, which is a characteristic of this conference. They are all new members of the Chinese Medical Association and the Chinese Pharmaceutical Association since 1954. Medical scientists from Hong Kong and Macau also came from afar to attend the conference.

Among the guests invited to attend the conference today were medical experts from the Soviet Union, Romania, North Korea, and other countries in Beijing, as well as medical experts from Indonesia.

More than a thousand people attended the conference today.

Fu Lianzhang, chairman of the Chinese Medical Association, delivered an opening speech on behalf of the five societies at the meeting. He said that this conference is a conference to advance towards science; the papers received by the conference have been reviewed by the specialized societies of each society for many days, and it is believed that both the quality and quantity have improved compared to the past.

In the afternoon session, the five societies respectively made work summary reports. Xu Yunbei, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Health, gave a report on some issues regarding uniting with traditional Chinese medicine and learning from traditional Chinese medicine.

The conference is scheduled to last for seven days.
