    The places where pigeons rest, I recognize them all,
    Her most natural abode is in the human mind.
                —Paul Éluard

    Can you believe that even the gentle-natured pigeons have recently stirred up trouble for the American authorities?
    Indeed, in many cities around the world, pigeons are usually regarded as domestic fowl; this is no exception in the United States. For example, New York City originally had a law protecting pigeons. But recently, New York City changed this law, and the New York City authorities announced that from July 1st, pigeons would be treated the same as other wild birds, and New York City would no longer protect them. This means that in American cities, pigeons have begun to become the target of shotguns, and anyone can capture or persecute them.
    Why have pigeons in America received such treatment?
    According to the New York City authorities who announced this new decree, this is because "pigeons grow too fast, are too troublesome, and too annoying," and therefore the leniency towards pigeons must be cancelled, and they must be placed in a situation where anyone can abuse and kill them.
    Indeed, growing too fast! Under her—that pigeon symbolizing peace—banner, an army of millions upon millions of peace-loving people opposed to war has gathered. Indeed, too troublesome! Under her—the peace ideal of good people around the world, countless young people in the United States, West Germany, Britain, and France today are unanimously shouting the slogan "We want bread, we don't want rifles."
    Indeed, too annoying! Why is the strength and will representing peace so strong? Isn't this also due to the belief in peace—this belief that did not shake the firm will of the persecuted Rosenbergs when they sat in the electric chair, overcoming the fear and sorrow of death…
    Unfortunate pigeons of New York City, the reason you are facing all persecution is simply because someone there fears peace!
    Where will you fly to build your nest? Pigeons of New York City!
    Please spread your pure white wings and fly over the dark, towering rooftops of Wall Street; under those gilded eaves, some people are troubled and angry about your reproduction; and their bloated bodies are now completely out of breath!

    鸽子在纽约的遭遇

    鸽子栖息的地方我全认得，
    她最自然的住处就是人的头脑。
                艾吕霞
    连性情温驯的鸽子，最近也惹起美国当局的烦恼了——这件事情你能够相信吗？
    不错，鸽子在全世界很多城市里，通常都是被当作家禽看待的；这就在美国也没有例外。例如纽约市原来有条法律是保护鸽子的。可是最近呢，纽约市改变了这条保护鸽子的法律，纽约市政当局宣布：从七月一日起，鸽子与其它野生的鸟类同等看待，纽约市不再对它加以保护了。这就是说，鸽子在美国城市里，已经开始成为可以被猎枪射击的对象，任何人都可以对它进行捕捉或迫害了。
    鸽子在美国为什么会得到这般遭遇呢？
    据宣布这种新法令的纽约市政当局解说道：这是由于“鸽子生长得太快、过于麻烦，太令人讨厌”的原故，因此就必须取消对于鸽子的宽待，并将她置之于任何人都可以加以虐杀的境地。
    的确是生长得太快了！就在她——那一只象征着和平的鸽子——的徽号下，团聚了千千万万反对战争的和平人类的大军。的确是过于麻烦了！就在她——在全世界善良人们的和平理想下，促使今天美国、西德、英国、法国的无数青年都一致地喊出“我们要面包，我们不要步枪”的呼声。
    的确是太令人讨厌了！代表和平的力量与意志为什么这样坚强呢？这难道不也是由于和平信念的原故么——这信念使得受迫害的罗森堡夫妇在坐上电椅的时候也没有动摇过坚定的意志，战胜了死亡的恐惧与悲哀…………
    不幸的纽约市的鸽子呵，你之所以面临着一切迫害，都只是因为有人在那儿畏惧和平！
    你将会飞到哪里去筑巢呢？纽约市的鸽子！
    请展开你那洁白的翅膀，飞过那阴暗的华尔街的高耸的屋顶吧；在那镀金的屋檐下，正有人为你的繁殖而苦恼、而气愤；并且他们那发胖的身体现在是一点儿也喘不过气来哩！
