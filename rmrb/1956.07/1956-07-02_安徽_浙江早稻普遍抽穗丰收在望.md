    Anhui · Zhejiang Early Rice Generally Heading and Expected Bumper Harvest
    (Our newspaper, Hefei dispatch) More than 20 million mu of early and mid-season rice in Anhui Province are generally growing well. More than 9 million mu of early rice are generally heading, and a bumper harvest is expected. It will be ready for harvesting in another half month; mid-season rice has begun to joint. The late rice sowing work, which can provide seedlings for 14 million mu of paddy fields, has also been basically completed. The golden world of wheat from a month ago has been occupied by rice, and the land is once again a new green. Farmers in Anhui Province have generally adopted the "seedling storage" method this year: first, plant the seedlings in the already irrigated fields with a row spacing of three inches instead of the past six inches; after the wheat is harvested, transplant the seedlings in the middle to the wheat stubble fields. In this way, not only can early rice be connected to wheat stubble, but also mid-season rice can avoid the disadvantage of planting old seedlings. Therefore, the area of early, mid and late rice has been greatly expanded compared with last year. The early and mid-season rice transplanted using the "seedling storage" method is even more robust than the early and mid-season rice that does not use this method. The reporter saw these robust early and mid-season rice in Feidong County and the suburbs of Hefei. Some people praised the seedling storage method as finding a "nursery" for rice.

    (Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou) The 24 million mu of rice in Zhejiang Province are growing well. The 7.35 million mu of continuous early rice of agricultural producers' cooperatives in various places have generally been pregnant with panicles and are heading. In Wenzhou, Jinhua and other regions, where the season is earlier, more than 3 million mu of continuous early rice have flowered and eared.
    This year, the continuous early rice in Zhejiang Province has increased by more than 6.44 million mu compared with last year. The more than 1 million mu of continuous early rice planted for the first time by agricultural cooperatives in the Hangzhou, Jiaxing and Huzhou areas are growing even better than the single-season rice last year. In the double-cropping rice area of the coastal plains of eastern Zhejiang, millions of mu of double-cropping early rice are also mostly growing better than last year. The double-cropping and single-cropping late rice throughout the province are also developing strongly.

    安徽·浙江早稻普遍抽穗丰收在望
    本报合肥电　安徽省两千多万亩早、中稻，普遍生长良好。早稻九百多万亩普遍抽穗，丰收在望，再有半个多月就可以收割；中稻开始圆杆。可供一千四百万亩水田栽秧的晚稻播种工作也基本结束。一个月以前小麦的金黄世界，已经都被水稻占据了，大地又是一片新绿。安徽省农民今年普遍采用了“窖秧”的办法：先在已灌水的田里把过去的六寸行距改为三寸行距插秧；小麦收割以后，再把中间的秧稞移栽到麦茬地里去。这样，不但使早稻接上了麦茬，而且使中稻也避免了栽老秧的缺点。因此，早、中、晚稻的面积都比去年大大扩大。用“窖秧”的办法移栽的早、中稻，有的比不采用这一办法的早、中稻，还长得茁壮。记者在肥东县和合肥郊区都看到了这些茁壮的早、中稻。有的人看了后，称赞窖秧的办法是为水稻找到了“托儿所”。

    据新华社杭州电　浙江省2400多万亩水稻生长良好。各地农业生产合作社的735万亩连作早稻已经普遍孕穗抽头。季节较早的温州、金华等专区，300多万亩连作早稻已扬花吐穗。
    今年浙江省连作早稻比去年增加了644万多亩，杭、嘉、湖地区农业社第一次种植的一百多万亩连作早稻，比去年的单季稻生长得还好。双季稻区的浙东沿海平原，几百万亩双季早稻也大都生长得比去年好。全省双季和单季晚稻也发棵健旺。
