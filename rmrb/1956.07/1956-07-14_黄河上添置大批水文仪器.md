Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, July 13th. The Yellow River Conservancy Commission is actively adding new equipment to hydrological stations on the Yellow River. The vast majority of the new equipment is used to measure flow. This new equipment includes current meters, sounding weights, winches, double boats, steel-framed river crossing cables, ultra-shortwave radios, and buoy launchers.

The winch used on boats for measuring flow velocity was designed by the Yellow River Conservancy Commission and successfully trial-produced by the Nanjing Hydraulic Engineering Instrument Factory for raising and lowering sounding weights. The double boat trial-produced by the Yellow River Conservancy Commission is stable and convenient when used to measure flood velocity and flow. In addition, more than one hundred suspended sediment samplers for measuring the sediment content of river water have been distributed to various hydrological stations. Balances capable of weighing 2,500 grams for analyzing sediment are being manufactured. With this newly trial-produced balance to analyze sediment, the work that previously required five people can now be completed by four.

    黄河上添置大批水文仪器
    新华社郑州13日电　黄河水利委员会正在积极为黄河上的水文站添置新设备。添置的新设备，绝大部分用于测验流量。这些新设备有流速仪、重铅鱼、绞关、双舟、钢架过河揽、超短波收音机、浮标投掷器等。
    测验流速的船只上用的绞关，是黄河水利委员会设计，经南京水利工程仪器制造厂试制成功，供起落重铅鱼用的。黄河水利委员会试制成的双舟，用于测验洪水的流速和流量时，又稳又方便。另外，还有一百多个测验河水含沙量的悬移质测验器，已分发给各水文站了。供分析泥沙用的可以称二千五百公分重量的天平正在制造，用这种新试制的天平分析泥沙，以前需要五人做的工作，现在有四人就可以完成了。
