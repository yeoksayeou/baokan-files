Shanxi Agricultural Cooperatives Universally Establish Work Quotas
Labor Efficiency Increases by Approximately 30%

(Our report) This newspaper reports that of the more than 19,000 agricultural cooperatives in Shanxi Province, more than 17,000 have established work quotas and are using work quotas to manage production labor; many cooperatives have also implemented a system of rewards for exceeding production targets and have prepared labor-day payment plans. After using work quotas to manage production labor, the phenomena of labor waste and egalitarianism in labor compensation have been greatly overcome, and labor efficiency has generally increased by about 30%. According to calculations by the Jinbei Special District, labor efficiency has generally increased by 35% compared to before the establishment of work quotas. The attendance rate has also increased. The "May 1st" cooperative in Weijiazhuang, Luan County, with a total of 1,681 laborers, completed 121,995 labor-days in February to May alone, an increase of 23% compared to the same period last year. After the Lujia Ye Agricultural Cooperative in Xinxian County implemented a method of calculating labor compensation using work quotas, the number of people attending work increased from 682 per month to 1,070. The adoption of this method has also greatly promoted the study of technology and inventions by cooperative members. For example, the Wangcun Liaoyuan Cooperative in Jieyu County now has 104 people who have learned techniques such as manufacturing granular fertilizer, preparing insecticides, operating diesel engines, and mastering seeders; Jing Lewa, Lü Yimin, and three others have collectively modified four types of waterwheels, increasing efficiency by one to four times compared to the original.

    山西农业社普遍制定工作定额
    劳动效率比过去提高30％左右
    本报讯　山西全省一万九千多个农业社中，已经有一万七千多个制定了工作定额，运用工作定额管理生产劳动；还有不少社实行了超产奖励制，并编制了劳动日支付计划。运用工作定额管理生产劳动以后，大大克服了劳力浪费和劳动报酬上的平均主义现象，劳动效率一般都提高30％左右。据晋北专区计算，劳动效率较制定工作定额以前一般提高了35％。出勤率也增加了。潞安县魏家庄“五一”社共1，681个劳力，仅二至五月份就做了121，995个劳动日，较上年同期增加23％。忻县芦家野农业社实行了用工作定额计算劳动报酬的办法以后，出勤人数由原来每月682人增到1，070人。采用这种办法，对社员学习技术和创造发明也起了很大推动作用。如解虞县王村燎原社现在已有104人学会了制造颗粒肥料、配杀虫药、开柴油机、掌握播种机等技术；景乐娃、吕一民等五人并集体改装了四种水车，效率比原来提高了一倍到四倍。
