    Why This Cheap and That Expensive?
    The canteen in our school treats teachers and students completely differently. Steamed buns in the teachers' canteen cost three fen, but in the students' canteen they cost four fen. The meat and tofu with cabbage dish in the students' canteen costs eight fen, while in the teachers' canteen, the same dish, with even more meat, only costs six fen.
    We really don't understand: the canteen serves both teachers and students, why treat them differently, and not equally?
            (Liu Dongquan and 15 others)

    何以贱此而贵彼？
    我们学校里的食堂，对老师和学生的待遇完全两样。老师食堂的馒头卖三分，拿到学生食堂就要卖四分，学生食堂卖的肉炒豆腐干白菜，要八分，而老师食堂也是同样的菜，肉还多些，只卖六分。
    我们真不懂：食堂为老师服务，也为学生服务，为什么要贱此而贵彼，不能一视同仁呢。
            （刘东泉等十六人）
