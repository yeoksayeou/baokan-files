    Fishing Locally to Supply the Market
    There are many rivers in the forest areas of Jilin Province, which are rich in various kinds of fish. However, the fish consumed by the residents of the forest area are transported from other places. Due to the long transportation time, the fish sometimes spoils. Why don't the commercial departments in the forest area organize the fishing of fresh local fish to supply the needs of the residents? (Xiu Jingyuan)

    就地捕鱼，供应市场
    吉林省林区有很多河流，盛产各种鱼类，但是林区居民吃的鱼却是从外地运来的，因为运输时间长有时就变质了。林区商业部门为什么不组织捕捞当地的新鲜鱼供应居民需要呢？　（修景元）
