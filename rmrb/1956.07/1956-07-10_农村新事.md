    New Things in the Countryside
    White Horse Revived
    Zhang Gouwang, of the Sixth Production Team of the Shengli Agricultural Cooperative in Mi County, Henan, raised a lovable white horse. Zhang Gouwang lacked experience in raising animals and let the horse get sick and unable to move, lying on the ground like a "dried skeleton."

    Old groom Chen Ming heard about this. He requested the cooperative not to slaughter it and that he be responsible for feeding it.

    The horse was too weak and did not want to eat grass, so he cooked feed mixed with salt to feed it. Later, when the horse could eat some grass, he chopped the grass small and fine, making it easier for the horse to eat. When he discovered the horse was sick, he would ask the veterinarian for treatment, regardless of day or night.

    This "dried skeleton" that was about to be slaughtered was revived and able to work in just over a month. It was originally only worth seven or eight yuan, but now it is worth more than sixty yuan.

    Fish Fry Saved
    Longhua Agricultural Cooperative in Baima Township, Jiangpu County, Jiangsu Province, wanted to develop sideline production, so they spent more than 500 yuan to buy nine fishing nets. They used the nets to catch 300,000 fish fry at the mouth of the Wu River and raised them in the cooperative's fish pond.

    On June 7, there was a sudden torrential rain, and the water depth on the ground was about half a foot. The water in the fish pond was about to overflow. At this time, Mao Fasheng, the director of sideline production, was eating at home. When he thought of the fish fry in the pond, he threw the bowl aside and, regardless of the torrential rain, carried a few bamboo mats and ran to the fish pond. When he ran to the fish pond, the water in the pond was about to overflow. He quickly inserted the bamboo mats at the pond's edge, blocking the fish fry's path. Finally, the cooperative's 300,000 fish fry were saved from loss.

    One Dime and Seven Cents
    Xie Changsheng, the accountant of the Eleventh Brigade of the Gonghe Agricultural Cooperative in Yuanjiang County, Hunan Province, found that the receipts were one dime and seven cents more than the payments when settling accounts this time during the transition to an advanced cooperative.

    Xie Changsheng did not treat this as a trivial matter and was determined to find out the reason. He checked the cash balance, counted the cash, and flipped through the original documents, spending a whole day and night, and finally clarified the problem.

    When people asked him why he went to so much trouble, he said: "This is everyone's business, and I can't be careless. If you don't hurry to find the reason when there is a mistake, bigger problems will come up later."

    农村新事
    白马复活
    河南密县胜利农业社第六生产队的张狗汪，养着一匹惹人喜爱的大白马。张狗汪缺乏饲养经验，把马养的疾病不脱身，躺在地上起不来，活活像个“干骨龙”。
    老饲养员陈明听到这个消息。他要求社里不要宰杀，由他负责喂养。
    这马太瘦弱了，不想吃草，他就把料煮好拌盐来喂。以后马能吃点草了，他就把草铡得又小又碎，使马吃着省劲。发现马有病，就不管白天、黑夜，都要去请兽医治疗。
    这个准备宰杀的“干骨龙”，不过一个多月的光景，就复膘能干活了。原来只值七、八元钱，现在能值六十多元。
    鱼花得救
    江苏江浦县白马乡龙华农业社想发展副业，花了五百多元买回九口渔网，用渔网在乌江口捉回三十万尾鱼花，养在社里的鱼塘内。
    六月七日，突然倾盆大雨，平地水深半尺左右；鱼塘里的水就要溢出来。这时候，副业主任毛发生正在家里吃饭。他一想到塘里的鱼花，便把碗扔在一边，不顾倾盆的大雨，扛起几条竹箔子就往鱼塘跑。当他跑到鱼塘时，塘里的水眼看要溢出来了。他急忙把竹箔子插在塘口上，挡住了鱼花的去路。终于使社的三十万尾鱼花没有受到损失。
    一角七分钱
    湖南沅江县共和农业社十一大队的会计谢长生，在这次转高级社结账时，发现收方比付方多了一角七分钱。
    谢长生并没有把这当作小事，决心要把原因找出来。他对了余额数现金，数了现金翻原始单据，整整花了一天一夜，终于把问题弄清楚。
    当人们问他费这样大的功夫干什么？他说：“这是大家的事，我不能草率。有了错误不赶快找原因，将来越错越出大问题。”
