Xinhua News Agency, July 19th. The Vice-Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) and Chairman of the Preparatory Committee of the All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese, Chen Jiageng, at a symposium held in Beijing today, called on returned overseas Chinese and overseas Chinese abroad to play an active role in promoting the peaceful liberation of Taiwan.

At the symposium, held to discuss how overseas Chinese should respond to Premier Zhou Enlai's call for the peaceful liberation of Taiwan, Chen Jiageng pointed out that the Chinese people have sufficient strength to liberate Taiwan and the coastal islands by war if necessary, but the Chinese people are willing to make the greatest efforts to strive for the peaceful liberation of Taiwan and the coastal islands under possible conditions. He said he believed this was also the unanimous wish of patriotic overseas Chinese abroad.

Chen Jiageng said that the broad masses of overseas Chinese abroad, including many Kuomintang members, are patriotic. Only a small number of overseas Chinese, due to a lack of understanding of the actual situation in the motherland, have taken or are still taking an antagonistic attitude towards the motherland. We hope that they can recognize right from wrong, bring into play their patriotism and love for their hometowns, stand with the vast number of patriotic overseas Chinese, and actively strive to promote the peaceful liberation of Taiwan, thereby completing the cause of national unification.

Peng Yi, the former captain of the 102nd Company of the First Army Automobile Group (Regiment) of the former Chiang army, who returned to the motherland in March of this year, reported at today's symposium on the dark situation in Taiwan under American occupation. He said that Chiang's army officers and soldiers generally have a growing sense of homesickness and war-weariness, and are increasingly aware that relying on American aggressive forces is unreliable. Peng Yi was sent to the US Army Transportation School in Virginia by the Chiang Kai-shek group last year for study, and escaped from Japan back to the motherland on his way back home this year. He said that among the Kuomintang military and political personnel, everyone with a sense of patriotism and national self-esteem is unwilling to be a tool for American expansion of the Cold War. He urged overseas Chinese to actively contribute to saving the people of Taiwan who are in dire straits, and to the unification of the motherland and peace in the Far East.

Hong Jinshan, who returned from Japan and is now studying at Renmin University of China, made a clear comparison at the symposium between the depressed life he had before returning to China and the happy life he has had after returning to China. Chen Shihua, a returned overseas Chinese from Indonesia and former principal of Taipei First Girls' High School, also spoke at the meeting about the difficult living conditions of the people of Taiwan and their longing for liberation. Chen Shihua is now the Deputy Director of Teaching Affairs at the Beijing Overseas Chinese Middle School Remedial School.

The symposium was jointly held by the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and the Preparatory Committee of the All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese. Those who spoke at the meeting included members of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference from Taiwan, overseas Chinese who returned from Malaya, Japan, the Philippines, Indonesia, and Burma, and compatriots from Taiwan. They all expressed their support for Premier Zhou Enlai's call for the peaceful liberation of Taiwan and put forward some specific suggestions.

    政协全国委员会和归国华侨联合会筹委会举行座谈会
    号召华侨为和平解放台湾贡献力量
    新华社19日讯　中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会副主席、中华全国归国华侨联合会筹备委员会主任委员陈嘉庚今天在北京举行的一个座谈会上，号召归国华侨和国外华侨共同在推动和平解放台湾的事业中发挥积极作用。
    在这个为讨论华侨应如何响应周恩来总理关于和平解放台湾的号召的问题而举行的座谈会上，陈嘉庚指出，中国人民是有足够的力量在必要的时候以战争的方式来解放台湾和沿海岛屿的，但是中国人民愿意尽最大的努力，在可能的条件下争取台湾以及沿海岛屿的和平解放。他说，他相信这也是国外爱国侨胞一致的愿望。
    陈嘉庚说，国外广大华侨，包括许多国民党员在内，都是爱国的；只有少数华侨由于不了解祖国的实际情况，曾经或者还在对祖国采取对立态度。我们希望他们能认清是非，发挥爱祖国、爱家乡的热忱，跟广大的爱国侨胞站在一起，积极为促进和平解放台湾，从而完成全国的统一事业而努力。
    在今年三月间回到祖国的前蒋军陆军汽车群（团）第一○二连上尉连长彭毅，在今天的座谈会上报告了台湾在美国侵占下的黑暗情况。他说，蒋军官兵普遍滋长着思家厌战情绪，并且日益认识到依靠美国侵略势力是不可靠的。彭毅在去年曾被蒋介石集团派到美国弗吉尼亚州陆军运输学校学习，今年在回国途中从日本逃回祖国。他说，在国民党军政人员中，每一个具有爱国感和民族自尊心的人，都已不愿再作美国扩张冷战的工具，他吁请海外侨胞为拯救水深火热中的台湾人民，为祖国的统一和远东的和平而积极贡献力量。
    从日本回国、现在中国人民大学读书的洪进山，在座谈会上把他回国前所过的苦闷生活和回国后的愉快生活，作了鲜明的对比。印度尼西亚归国华侨、前台北第一女子中学校长陈士华，也在会上谈了台湾人民困苦不堪的生活状况和盼望解放的心情。陈士华现在任北京归国华侨中等补习学校副教导主任。
    座谈会是由中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会和中华全国归国华侨联合会筹备委员会联合举行的。在会上发言的，有台湾籍的中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会委员，有从马来亚、日本、菲律宾、印度尼西亚、缅甸归国的华侨，有来自台湾的同胞。他们都对周恩来总理关于和平解放台湾的号召表示支持，并且提出了一些具体建议。
