All the cadres of the Ankang County Committee of the Communist Youth League first studied artificial pollination techniques and then passed them on to rural youth in stages. During this period, technical spare-time schools and technical research groups in various places have all made learning artificial pollination a central focus, enabling the vast number of young people to quickly master this new technology. In Zhen'an County, more than 10,000 young people and children from various organs and schools across the county were mobilized to make pollination plates and pollinators and donate them to agricultural cooperatives.
