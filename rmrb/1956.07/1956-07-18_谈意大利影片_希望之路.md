On the border between Italy and France, a group of tired and haggard people finally crossed the snow-covered Alps in a storm and arrived at a bright, open place. They stopped, looked around, and their faces showed relief: "We're in France!"

Italian and French soldiers patrolling the border line discovered them. The arrival of the soldiers cast a shadow on the faces of these cross-border people again. Without passports, perhaps they would be forced to return, just like at the Rome police station. But the innocent child in Barbara's arms smiled. His smile was so innocent that it infected the French soldier who was looking at him. Could this group of cross-border people be a smuggling gang, or fugitives? The soldiers didn't question them further and silently turned around and left. Here, on the border line, precisely because "the mountains are high and the emperor is far away," people are more likely to reveal genuine human warmth. And this warmth seemed to add another layer of hope to this group of people seeking survival. They picked up their bags and moved forward again.

This is the ending of "The Road to Hope." This group of people chasing "hope" has moved forward, but who knows what awaits them ahead: a job with a salary of 40,000 francs a month, equivalent to 80,000 lira, or something else? This ending, which seems to give a little hope but also leaves a question mark, makes people unable to help but keep the fates of those characters in mind, unable to help but repeatedly recall their miserable experiences depicted in the film, and to think deeply about them.

The people depicted in "The Road to Hope" are not yet people with awakened social consciousness. They have only embarked on this path of survival spontaneously and out of necessity. The film's author also clearly tells people that the proposal to go to France was just a scam by a swindler. As for later, after the swindler ran away, some people continued to move forward. It would be better to say that they had no way to retreat than to say that some "hope" was attracting them. They cannot return home, and they cannot find a place to sell their labor. This is a profound tragedy of capitalist society. "The Road to Hope" powerfully showcases this tragic reality.

The film has very moving descriptions of the sympathy and friendship of these people who cannot return home in times of adversity. The more kind and upright these people are, the more unjust and unreasonable the society that subjects these people to such miserable experiences appears. The film uses these people to make a strong accusation against that unjust society.

The island of Sicily has so many sulfur mines, but it cannot support its sons who are miners; people love their homeland so much, but they have to leave their hometowns. Ciro and his children huddled silently in the empty house after selling their furniture; the youngest child threw a bouquet of wildflowers to his mother's grave from the car window; the newlyweds whispered sweet nothings on the night train. How much humanity is contained within, and how much misery! These people, who yearn to get work and want to exchange their labor for a full meal, have just found temporary work on a farm and just spent a happy night, but the next day they clashed with the local agricultural workers. It turned out that there was a strike going on here, and the striking workers mistakenly regarded them as strikebreakers. Why did they have such a difficult and tortuous experience, and who made them like this? The film does not answer directly, and in fact, there is no need to answer directly. People will find the answer themselves.

Through these plots, the film movingly shows us the kind and upright souls of these working people.

The film's technique is also concise and clever. Here I would like to cite only one example:

In the small inn on the border, Barbara and Vanni meet again. She obediently accepts Vanni's crude caresses and says, "I'll still go with you!" But only a moment later, she resolutely says again, "You can kill me, but I won't go with you." This change comes suddenly, but it is also convincing. The film handles the turning point of this change very skillfully. Barbara and Vanni walk towards the door together. Ciro's youngest son calls her name and runs over reluctantly. Barbara turns around and hugs the child in her arms. Vanni pulls her away and pushes the child down fiercely. The plot is that simple. The reason why this simple plot can constitute the turning point of Barbara's change and make people convinced is because it evokes not only in Barbara's heart, but also in the audience's heart, the true warmth between people on the road between Barbara and Ciro, and Ciro's children, in stark contrast to Vanni's extreme coldness at this moment.

The film shows some sympathy for Vanni's character through his relationship with Barbara: his corruption is ultimately caused by that sinful society; but the film also expresses the condemnation of such a person through Barbara's severance from him: he is cutting himself off from those who have given him sympathy. In contrast to Vanni's destroyed humanity, there is the genuine human care and sympathy on the part of Ciro, Barbara, the old accountant, and other people, their mutual support in times of adversity, their strong will to survive in the face of setbacks, and their integrity and kindness of heart that remain undiminished even under heavy pressure. The film passionately praises the noble qualities of these people and wins our deep emotion.

The hope mentioned in "The Road to Hope" is clearly meant to be placed in quotation marks. The film does not point out a real way out for people. This is a common weakness of some progressive Italian films that we have seen. However, if we consider the harsh environment in which Italian progressive films are located, the government's strengthened censorship of films, then we can also understand why the authors of these progressive films prefer to choose themes that expose the dark side of reality and less to show the positive aspects of the development of Italian society. However, in today's Italy, in Italy where more than two million communists are uniting all progressive forces and carrying out unremitting struggles through various channels to fight for the right to life, we need not doubt that the spontaneous pursuit of survival by the working people will converge into the conscious struggle of the broad masses, and they will find the real "Road to Hope."

### 谈意大利影片“希望之路”

    谈意大利影片“希望之路”
    冯明
    在意大利和法国的边境上，一群疲惫不堪、面容憔悴的人，终于在风暴中翻过了积雪皑皑的阿尔卑斯山，来到了一片阳光耀眼的开阔的地方。他们停下脚步，举目四望，脸上现出了安堵的神色：“到法国了！”
    巡逻在国境线上的意大利和法国的士兵发现了他们。士兵们的到来，使这一群越境的人脸上又罩上了阴影。没有护照，也许会像在罗马警察局一样，又要强迫他们回去的吧。但是抱在芭白拉手上的无心的孩子，却笑了。他笑得那样天真，以致这笑也传染了向他注视的那个法国士兵。难道这群越境的人会是走私的帮口，或是在逃的歹徒？士兵们没有再盘诘什么，默默地转回身，走了。在这儿，国境线上，正因为“山高皇帝远”，人们反而易于流露出真正人的温暖。而这种温暖，仿佛给这群求生的人又平添了一层希望。他们背起行囊，重又迈步前进。
    这是“希望之路”的结尾。这群追逐“希望”的人是朝前走了，但等在他们前面的，究竟是一个月四万法郎、合八万里拉的工作，还是别的什么，又有谁知道呢？这个似乎给人一点希望、但又抹上一个问号的结尾，使人们不能不把那些剧中人的命运萦系于怀，不能不去反复回味影片里所表现的他们的可悲的遭遇，而有所深思。
      “希望之路”里所描写的这群人，还不是具有觉醒了的社会意识的人。他们只是自发地，也是迫不得已地走上了这条求生的道路。影片作者也分明告诉了人们提议到法国去那不过是骗子的一个骗局。至于后来，骗子逃走以后，还有一些人继续前进，与其说那是有什么“希望”在招引他们，倒不如说他们后退无路。有家归不得，想找一个出卖劳动力的地方而不可得，这是资本主义社会的深刻的悲剧。“希望之路”是有力地展示了这个悲剧性的现实的。
    影片对于这群有家归不得的人们在患难中的同情和友爱，有着非常动人的描写。这些人越是善良正直，使得这些人受到那样可悲遭际的社会，也就显得越不公正，越不合理。影片就是通过这些人，对那个不公正的社会提出了强烈的控诉。
    西西里岛空有那么多硫磺矿藏，可是它却养不活它的这群当矿工的儿子；人们是那样热爱乡土，可是他们却不得不背井离乡。赛罗和他的孩子们在卖掉了家具的空屋子里默默无言的偎依；那个最小的孩子从汽车窗子抛给妈妈墓地的一束野花；那对新婚夫妇在夜车上的窃窃私语，这里面蕴藏了多少人情，又有多少凄苦啊！这群渴望得到工作，渴望用自己双手换取一顿饱饭的人们，刚刚在一家农场找到了临时工作，刚刚度过一个欢乐的夜晚，第二天却又同当地的农业工人发生了冲突。原来这儿正在罢工，罢工工人误把他们当成破坏罢工的工贼了。他们为什么会有如此坎坷多难的遭遇，是谁使他们如此的？影片没有正面答复，其实也无须正面答复，人们自会找到答案的。
    影片通过这些情节，动人地为我们展示了这些劳动人民的善良正直的灵魂。
    影片的手法也是简洁而高明的。这里我想只举一个例子：
    在国境上的小客栈里，芭白拉和万尼重又遇到一起，她顺从地接受了万尼的粗鲁的抚爱，说道：“我还是跟你走！”但是只隔了一会，她就又决然地说道：“你杀了我都可以，我不跟你走了。”这转变来得突然，但也使人信服。影片处理这个转变的契机，是很巧妙的。芭白拉和万尼一同向门口走去。赛罗的小儿子叫着她的名字依恋地跑了过去。芭白拉回身把孩子抱在怀里，万尼把她一把拖开，恶狠狠地推倒了孩子。情节就这么简单。这个简单的情节所以能构成芭白拉转变的契机，并且使人信服，就因为它不仅在芭白拉心里，而且也在观众心里唤起了芭白拉和赛罗、和赛罗的孩子们一路上人与人之间的真正的温暖，同此时此地万尼的极端冷酷的鲜明对比。
    影片对万尼这个人物，通过芭白拉和他的关系，表示了某些同情：他的变坏，毕竟是那个罪恶社会造成的；但影片通过芭白拉跟他的绝离，也表示了对于这样一个人的宣判：他是自绝于那些对他寄与过同情的人们的。同万尼的被毁坏了的人性相对照的，是赛罗、芭白拉、老会计师以及其他人们身上的那种真挚的人与人的关怀和同情，患难中的相濡相煦，百折不回的强烈的求生意志，虽在重压之下仍然不损分毫的正直和善良的心。影片热烈地歌颂了这些人的高贵品质，赢得了我们的深深感动。
    “希望之路”所说的希望，明明是在要放到引号里的，影片并没有给人们指出一条真正的出路。这是我们看到的一些意大利进步影片所共有的弱点。但是，如果我们想到意大利进步电影所处的恶劣环境，政府加强于影片的检查制度，那末我们也就可以理解为什么这些进步影片的作者宁愿选择这类揭露现实阴暗面的题材，而较少地去表现意大利社会的发展的积极因素的一面了。但是，在今天的意大利，在有二百多万共产党人团结着一切进步力量，通过各种途径为争取生活的权利进行着不懈的斗争的意大利，我们也不必怀疑，劳动人民的自发的求生，是会汇合到广大群众的自觉的斗争中间去的，他们会找到真正的“希望之路”的。（附图片）
