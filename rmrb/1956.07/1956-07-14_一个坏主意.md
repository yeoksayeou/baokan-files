    A Bad Idea
    The Shanghai Xinwen Ribao (Shanghai News Daily) published an editorial on the 10th of this month entitled "A Bad Idea," severely criticizing a measure taken by the Shanghai Municipal Public Catering Company that obstructs freedom of the press. It also published the "Provisional Measures for Releasing News and Information to the Outside World" that were being circulated within the company. These measures stipulate that the release of news and information to the outside world, as well as the submission of articles to newspapers, whether in the name of the company or in an individual capacity, must be "uniformly controlled" and "registered for future reference." The head of the Secretariat Section has the power to "decide whether or not to publish or to revise the content," and "writers must not object." Finally, it is stipulated that 40% of the payment for articles will be "used for mass recreational activities."
    The Xinwen Ribao editorial pointed out that this measure is an unreasonable restriction and crude interference with the activities of newspaper correspondents, and is a bad idea that violates the Constitution. Its purpose is to prevent people from revealing the shortcomings and errors within the company.
    The editorial said that since there are both pleasant and unpleasant things in our real life, it is wrong to "only report good news and not bad news" or "only report bad news and not good news." Our newspapers should not only vigorously report our construction achievements that we are proud of, but also dare to reveal the shortcomings and errors on the road of progress. It is impossible for bureaucrats to attempt to unify public opinion so that they can sit high on comfortable chairs and be at peace.

    一个坏主意
    上海新闻日报本月十日以“一个坏主意”为题发表社论，严厉地批评了上海市公共饮食公司一项妨碍新闻自由的措施。并且公布了正在这个公司内部传阅的“对外发布新闻消息暂行办法”。这个办法中规定：对外发布新闻消息以及送各报社通讯稿件，不论以公司名义或个人名义，都要“统一掌握”，“登记备查”，秘书科科长有“决定可否发布或删改内容”之大权，“写稿人不得有所异议”，最后还规定稿酬的40％“作为群众性文娱活动费用”。
    新闻日报的社论指出：这个办法是对报纸通讯员活动无理的限制和粗暴的干涉，是违反宪法的一种坏主意。它的目的，是生怕有人把公司里的缺点和错误漏出去。
    社论说，既然我们现实生活中有愉快的事情，有不愉快的事情，那么，“报喜不报忧”或者“报忧不报喜”都是不对的。我们的报纸，不但要大力报道我们引为自豪的建设成就，而且要敢于揭示前进途中的缺点和错误。官僚主义者企图统一舆论，以便自己高坐在安乐椅上，太平无事，是不可能的。
