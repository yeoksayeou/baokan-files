A "Cecum"
Chen Xiang

Not long ago, I came to the Qimen Station on the southern section of the Yuehan Railway. All around the station, I saw construction materials such as rubble and river sand piled up everywhere. The rails and sleepers of the first track, like a loose raft, lay lazily on the collapsed roadbed. Not far away, hundreds of workers were working hard. Some were dismantling the old revetments and earth retaining walls, while others were building new ones. The track construction project at Qimen Station was in full swing.

This situation could not help but evoke my memories and surprise me. The track construction project at Qimen Station did not involve a large workload, only about 300 meters in length. It started in the same year as the Yingxia Railway. In August 1954, when I passed Qimen Station, I saw the workers working hard. In April 1955, when I passed Qimen Station for the second time, I saw the workers still working hard. Now, another year has passed, and the Yingxia Railway has been partially opened to traffic. This is my third visit to Qimen Station, and this short track project is still under construction.

Twenty-odd months, unable to complete a track of only 300 meters. What is going on? In order to understand this unusual matter, I visited some people who knew the inside story.

They told me: Since liberation, the volume of transport on the Yuehan Railway has been increasing day by day. Trains often have to meet at Qimen Station, but the station yard is narrow, and there are few tracks, which cannot meet the transport needs and affect the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas and the turnover of locomotives and vehicles. The traffic department has repeatedly requested the addition of a track at Qimen Station. In 1954, the Guangzhou Railway Administration instructed the design office to be responsible for the design of the track addition project at Qimen Station.

Qimen Station is located by mountains and rivers, and the terrain is very narrow. To add a track here requires in-depth on-site investigation and research. However, the designers not only did not conduct in-depth on-site investigation and research but also did not solicit the opinions of the Pingshi Engineering Section, which is responsible for managing this section of the line and is therefore familiar with the terrain. Instead, they drew up the construction drawings in the office based on a few survey data. According to this construction drawing, it is not a matter of adding a track, but of relocating the entire station. What is particularly serious is that, according to this construction drawing, the new track is to be built on semi-soft and semi-hard floating soil, which is in danger of sinking. Moreover, the embankment, which is as high as 17 meters, only has a slope of one to one meter, which cannot guarantee safety.

The Pingshi Engineering Section heard about this strange construction drawing and repeatedly raised opinions to the design office and relevant departments at higher levels to modify the design before construction even started, but the design office did not accept it. The Engineering Department of the Guangzhou Railway Administration also believed that this design was wrong and refused to sign the construction drawing. At this point, the erroneous design of the track addition project at Qimen Station could have been corrected. Who knew that the Guangzhou Railway Administration disregarded these opinions and ordered the Fourth Engineering Team to carry out the construction according to the drawing on August 10, 1954.

Zhang Jingwen, the deputy captain of the Fourth Engineering Team, also discovered the errors in the design, raised the same opinions as the Pingshi Engineering Section, and drew up the lessons learned from the failures caused by similar erroneous designs he had seen in Liuzhou and other places for decades, asking the design office to pay attention, but the design office also ignored it.

Not long after construction started, the loose rocks on the eastern hillside did fall, and the situation became more and more serious. It was truly a scene of dangerous rocks and perilous conditions. Once, a traffic accident occurred because of this. In order to prevent the loose rocks from continuing to fall, it was necessary to clear all 400 cubic meters of loose rocks on the top of the mountain. The Fourth Engineering Team temporarily became a clearing team. The track maintenance workers have since developed a chronic illness. As for the dry-laid rubble revetment, it also began to sink after only half of it was built. The workers were all anxious and said: "This is not construction! This is making fun of national property." Zhang Jingwen was also very anxious and reported to his superiors again:
"We can't continue like this. If we continue like this, I will be driven to a nervous breakdown."

At this time, the design office began to panic a little, but they did not give up the idea of this erroneous design at all. They only designed an earth retaining wall in the middle of the embankment slope, and this earth retaining wall was not built on the underground rock layer, but on loose soil and rocks.

At the end of 1954, it was time for all construction projects to be completed. Orders from the Guangzhou Railway Administration came one after another. The Fourth Engineering Team received the order to rush the work, and the Pingshi Engineering Section received the order to take over the project as soon as possible. The acceptance team, led by Fu Ran, the deputy director of the Administration, and Xiao Jin, the chief engineer, also rushed to the construction site in a hurry.

On December 23, the "track addition project" at Qimen Station was completed. However, the problems followed. The roadbed began to sink, and the dry-laid rubble revetment bulged with a "big belly." A wooden stick more than one meter long could be easily inserted into it. The problem was so serious that the responsible comrades of the Pingshi Engineering Section dared not sign the acceptance form. Deputy Director Fu Ran, seeing that the project could not be accepted without being reported to the Ministry of Railways for reimbursement, said anxiously at the acceptance meeting: "It's the end of the year, and the accounts must be settled! Accept it first, send someone to guard it, and temporarily try to run freight cars. Other problems will be discussed later."

The Pingshi Engineering Section had no choice but to take over the project and send people to patrol the line day and night to maintain traffic safety.

In March 1955, after a few days of heavy rain, the track revealed its true form: the dry-laid rubble revetment was expanding everywhere, the rubble masonry foundation was cracking all over the ground, and the roadbed had sunk to 290 millimeters. Stones in the roadbed kept making rolling noises. Every time a train passed, the track maintenance workers had to raise the track once. Although the Pingshi Engineering Section sent people to guard it day and night, it was impossible to even "try to run" freight cars. Another "try" would result in a derailment. It was truly extremely dangerous. The Pingshi Engineering Section repeatedly reported the serious situation to the higher levels, and the Guangzhou Railway Administration had no choice but to order the closure of the line. However, even in the face of such serious facts, Zhuo Guanpei, the acting chief engineer of the Administration, and the engineers of the design office still said coldly that this was "making a mountain out of a molehill."

After the road was closed, the transport task could not but be affected, and the traffic department constantly demanded that the Administration quickly find a way to repair the track. In April 1955, the project started again. However, the design office did not accept the lessons of failure that had been learned at such a high cost. As a result, the roadbed continued to sink because the embankment was too high and the slope was too steep, and adding rubble masonry revetment to replace part of the dry-laid rubble revetment increased the burden on the roadbed. Even the earth retaining wall began to crack. This capital construction project was again done in vain. The total cost of the two capital construction projects was more than 158,000 yuan, which was thrown into the river without even hearing a sound.

Two years later, this disaster-ridden track is still not open to traffic. The design office also knew that it could not continue to make mistakes and redesigned it according to the opinions put forward by the Pingshi Engineering Section and the Fourth Engineering Team. According to this design, the third construction was organized in March this year. A worker said: "If the design office and the Guangzhou Railway Administration had listened to our opinions a little, not only would a large amount of funds have been saved for the country, but the track would have been open to traffic long ago."

Who is not angry knowing this? Along the railway line, we see track maintenance workers overcoming various difficulties, finding discarded sleepers, carving away the decayed parts like sculptures, trying to patch and piece them together into sleepers that can continue to be used. If it is really impossible to piece them together, they still think of ways to cut them into strips of wood to plug the rail spike holes. In this way, they do not let go of any small place and save funds for the country bit by bit. On the cliffs of high mountains and steep walls, we see workers creating various methods to fight stubbornly against landslides and dangerous rocks that endanger traffic safety, protect the line, and allow trains loaded with national construction materials to pass safely. When we see these moving scenes, we cannot help but think of the track at Qimen Station, the tens of thousands of yuan of national funds that were thrown away without pity; we think of how this place has been a "cecum" hindering the improvement of passing capacity for two years. May I ask these people who affect national construction and squander money like dirt, have you ever thought that this is a criminal act!

    一条“盲肠”
    陈襄
    不久以前，我来到粤汉铁路南段的岐门车站。只见车站四周到处堆积着施工用的片石和河沙，第一股道的钢轨和枕木，好像松散了的木筏一样，懒洋洋地爬在下坍的路基上。相距不远的地方，几百名工人正在紧张地劳动。有的在拆除旧的护坡和御土墙，有的在砌新的护坡和御土墙。岐门车站的股道修建工程进行得正紧张呢。
    这种情形，不由得引起我的回忆，并且使我感到惊奇，岐门车站的股道修建工程工作量不大，全长不过三百多公尺，它是同鹰厦铁路在同一年里动工的。1954年8月，我路过岐门车站的时候，看见工人们在紧张施工，1955年4月，我第二次路过岐门车站的时候，看见工人们还在紧张施工。如今，又是一年的时间过去了，鹰厦铁路已经部分通车，我第三次来到岐门车站，这短短的股道工程竟还在紧张施工。
    二十几个月的时间，修不好一条只三百多公尺的股道。这是怎么一回事呢？为了弄清这件不太平常的事，我访问了一些知道底细的人。
    他们告诉我：解放以来，粤汉铁路的运输量日益增长，列车经常要在岐门车站会车，可是岐门车站的站场窄，股道少，不能满足运输需要，影响了城乡物资交流和机车、车辆的周转。车务部门一再要求在岐门车站增建一条股道。1954年，广州铁路管理局责成设计事务所负责设计岐门车站的股道增建工程。
    岐门车站依山傍水，地形非常狭隘。要在这里增建一条股道，是需要深入现场调查研究的。可是，设计人员不但没有深入现场实地调查研究，也没有征求负责管理这段线路，因而熟悉地形的坪石工务段的意见，就在办公室里凭着少数勘测资料，划出施工图来。按照这个施工图，就不是要增建一股股道的问题，而是要把整个车站搬家。特别严重的是，按照这个施工图，新的股道要建筑在半软半硬的浮土上，有下沉的危险；而且高达十七公尺的路堤只做一比一公尺的坡度，不能保证安全。
    坪石工务段听说设计出这么一个奇怪的施工图，没等开工就三番五次地向设计事务所和上级有关部门提出修改设计的意见，可是设计事务所不接受。广州铁路管理局工务处也认为这个设计有错误，不肯在施工图上签字。到这种地步，岐门车站增建股道工程的错误的设计是可以被纠正过来的。谁知广州铁路管理局竟不顾这些意见，于1954年8月10日命令第四工程队按图施工。
    第四工程队副队长张景文也发现了设计中的错误，提出了同坪石工务段相同的意见，并且把几十年来在柳州等地所见到的，由于性质类似的错误的设计而招致的失败的教训，绘出图来，提请设计事务所注意，但是设计事务所也没有理会。
    开工不久，东边山坡上松散的岩石果然下落，而且情况越来越严重。真是危石罗列、险象环生。有一次就因此发生了行车事故。为了不让松散的岩石再继续下落，只好把山顶上共有四百立方公尺的松散的岩石全部清理下来。第四工程队暂时变成了清方队。养路工人们从此怀了一个病根子。至于干砌片石护坡，只码了一半，也开始下沉了。工人们都急得说：这哪儿是施工呀！这是拿国家财产开玩笑。张景文也急坏了，又向上级反映：
  “不能再这么干下去了，再这么下去，我会给逼出神经病来。”
    这时候，设计事务所才开始有点发慌了，但是，他们并没有丝毫放弃这个错误的设计的念头，只是在路堤边坡中腰设计了一道御土墙，而且这御土墙又没有筑在地下石层上，而是筑在松土石上了。
    1954年年底，是各项建设工程到了该结束的时候了。广州铁路管理局的命令一道一道地发出来。第四工程队接到的是赶工命令，坪石工务段接到的是赶紧接收的命令。以管理局副局长符然和总工程师肖瑾为首组成的验收小组也匆匆忙忙赶到工地。
    十二月二十三日，岐门车站的“股道增建工程”大功告成。然而，问题也就跟着来了。路基开始下沉，干砌片石护坡鼓起“大肚子”，一公尺多长的木棍可以随随便便地插进去。问题这样严重，坪石工务段的负责同志不敢在验收单上签字。符然副局长眼看不把工程验收下来，不能向铁道部报销，在验收会议上着急地说：“年底了，账不能不结呵！先接收了，派人看守，暂时试通货车，其他问题等以后再说。”
    坪石工务段不得不把工程接收下来，派了人日夜在线路上巡视，维护行车安全。
    1955年3月，几天大雨，这条股道现了原形：干砌片石护坡到处膨胀，浆砌片石基础遍地开裂，路基竟下沉到二百九十公厘，石块在路基里不断发出滚动的响声。过一次车，养路工人就要起一次道。坪石工务段虽然派了人日夜看守，连试通货车也不行了，再“试通”就要翻车。真是危险万分。坪石工务段再三向上级反映情况严重，广州铁路管理局才不得不下令封锁线路。然而，即使在这样严重的事实面前，管理局的代总工程师卓观培和设计事务所的工程师们还冷言冷语地说这是“小题大做”。
    路封了以后，运输任务不能不受到影响，车务部门不断要求管理局赶快设法修通这股道。1955年4月，这项工程又开工了。可是，设计事务所并没有接受花了这么大的代价得来的失败的教训，结果还是因为路堤太高，边坡太陡，加上把部分干砌片石护坡改成浆砌片石护坡，更增加了路基的负担，不但是路基继续下沉，连御土墙也开始崩裂了。这项基本建设工程又算白做了。两次基本建设工程费用共计十五万八千多元，就这样丢到大河里，连一点声响也没有听到。
    事隔两年，这条多灾多难的股道还是不能通车。设计事务所也知道不能再错下去了，才按照坪石工务段和第四工程队提出的意见重新设计。按照这个设计，今年三月组织了第三次施工。一位工人说：“设计事务所和广州铁路管理局要是多多少少听听我们大伙的意见，不但给国家节省大批资金，而且早就通车了”。
    知道这件事情的人，谁不气愤呢？在铁路沿线上，我们看到养路工人们克服各种困难，把废枕木找来，像雕刻一样地把腐朽了的部分砍去，想法把它镶补、并凑成一根能继续用的枕木；实在不能拼凑了，也还是想想办法砍成一条条的木塞，用来塞道钉眼。他们就这样不放松任何一个细小的地方，一点一滴地替国家节约资金。在高山陡壁的悬岩上，我们看到工人们创造各种方法，向危及行车安全的坍方、危石进行顽强的斗争，保护线路，让满载国家建设物资的列车安全通过。当我们看到这些动人的情景时，不由得想起岐门车站那条股道，想起那几十万元国家资金被毫不怜惜地丢掉了；想起两年来，这里一直成了提高通过能力的“盲肠”。请问这些影响国家建设，挥金如土的人们，有没有想过这是一种犯罪的行为啊！
