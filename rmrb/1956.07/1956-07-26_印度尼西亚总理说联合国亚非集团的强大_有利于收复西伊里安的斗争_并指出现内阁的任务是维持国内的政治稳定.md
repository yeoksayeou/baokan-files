Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, July 25th: Prime Minister Sastroamidjojo said at the plenary session of the 8th National Congress of the Indonesian Nationalist Party in Semarang on the evening of July 23 that the current cabinet's task is to maintain domestic political stability in order to realize the cabinet's program.

When talking about the economic and financial difficulties his government is facing, he said that the rupiah's exchange rate continues to fall, there is too much currency in circulation, and salaries and wages are insufficient, thus creating economic contradictions.

He said: "The purpose of the five-year plan drafted by the current cabinet is specifically to industrialize Indonesia. Industrialization will make this country no longer need to rely on other countries to supply our future needs.

The West Irian issue will be resolved within the scope of abolishing the Round Table Conference agreements.

Sastroamidjojo emphasized the great significance of the Bandung Conference and pointed out that the Asian-African group in the United Nations has become stronger, which is beneficial to Indonesia's struggle to recover West Irian. He said that this fact is encouraging: since the end of the Bandung Conference, Arab countries have been pursuing an independent foreign policy.

The Prime Minister pointed out that tensions still exist in several regions of the world. In the Far East, the tension is due to the fact that People's China is still excluded from the United Nations; in Europe, it is due to the division of Germany; in the Middle East, it is due to the hostility between Arabs and Israel; and in North Africa, it is due to the unstable situation in Algeria.

He said that President Sukarno's recent visit to Western countries has strengthened Indonesia's international position.

The Prime Minister said that the achievements of the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union have brought new vitality to Soviet foreign policy. He hopes that this will contribute to easing international tensions.

    印度尼西亚总理说联合国亚非集团的强大
    有利于收复西伊里安的斗争
    并指出现内阁的任务是维持国内的政治稳定
    据新华社雅加达25日电　沙斯特罗阿米佐约总理七月二十三日晚上在三宝垄举行的印度尼西亚国民党第八次全国代表大会全体会议上说，现内阁的任务是要维持国内的政治稳定，以便实现内阁的政纲。
    他在谈到他的政府所面临的经济和财政困难的时候说，盾的兑换率继续下降，流通的货币太多，而薪水和工资却不够，因此产生了经济矛盾。
    他说：“现内阁草拟的五年计划的目的特别在于使印度尼西亚工业化，工业化将使这个国家不再需要依靠别国来供应我们将来的需要。
    西伊里安问题将在废除圆桌会议协定的范围内解决。
    沙斯特罗阿米佐约在着重指出万隆会议的巨大意义的时候指出，联合国中的亚非集团已经更强大了，这是有利于印度尼西亚为收复西伊里安而进行的斗争的。他说，这个事实是令人鼓舞的：自从万隆会议结束以来，阿拉伯国家一直在奉行独立的外交政策。
    这位总理指出，在世界上好几个地区仍然存在着紧张局势。在远东，紧张局势是由于人民中国仍然被排斥于联合国之外这一事实引起的；在欧洲，这是由于德国的分裂；在中东是由于阿拉伯和以色列之间的敌对，在北非是由于阿尔及利亚的不稳定的局势。
    他说，苏加诺总统最近对西方国家的访问已经加强了印度尼西亚的国际地位。
    这位总理说，苏联共产党第二十次代表大会的成就给苏联外交政策带来了新的生气。他希望这会对缓和国际紧张局势作出贡献。
