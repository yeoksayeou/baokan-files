    Lining Up Plaques
    Cai Qun

    Some years ago, I heard a friend say: the further down you go, the larger and more numerous the plaques hung by government offices and organizations become. A township government's plaques are often larger than those of some central government agencies; the number of plaques at some entrances is astonishing. This was just hearsay, but this time I went to Wuhan and had the good fortune to witness it myself.

    Often, a long string of plaques hangs beside the door of a government office. At first, I thought many agencies were housed in one building, but after seeing it many times, I realized it was something else entirely. Let me give an example of the names of the plaques seen at the entrance of one government office: "China ×× Company Hubei Provincial Company," "Chinese Communist Party China ×× Company Hubei Provincial Company Branch," "China ×× Trade Union China ×× Company Hubei Provincial Company Grassroots Committee," "Sino-Soviet Friendship Association China ×× Company Hubei Provincial Company Branch," "China ×× Company Hubei Provincial Company People's Complaint Reception Office," "Chinese New Democratic Youth League China ×× Company Hubei Provincial Company General Branch," "………".

    A little curious, I glanced inside again and immediately discovered that two more plaques were lying against the wall under the reception office, near the gate. One was facing the dirt, back up, and you couldn't see the writing; the other was lying on its back in a grand manner, with the words "China Sports Association China ×× Company Hubei Provincial Company Branch" in large red characters. These two plaques were probably relegated to the courtyard because there was no place to hang them anymore, and sooner or later they will have to find a place to live outside. Truly, the Party, the government, the trade union, the Youth League… everything is complete, each with its own plaque.

    This is not a rare phenomenon. Once I went to a rural area in the suburbs and saw that a township primary school also had a whole set of plaques. Not to mention the school's name, the Youth League branch, the Education Trade Union grassroots committee, etc., there was also a most dazzling large plaque, written in vermilion letters: "Chinese Young Pioneers ×× Township Primary School Brigade Headquarters."

    It goes without saying that our agencies and organizations have Party and Youth League organizations and various mass organizations; this is just like a person having a brain, internal organs, limbs… If someone were to be clever and put labels on each part of the body: "So-and-so's Brain," "So-and-so's Left Hand," "So-and-so's Right Foot," etc., people would either call him crazy or laugh at him as a fool. But why is it considered a normal, common practice for an agency to hang a long string of plaques?

    牌子排队　　　
    蔡群
    前些年听一位朋友说：越到下层去，机关、团体所挂的牌子就越大越多，一个乡政府的牌子往往会比中央某些机关的牌子还要大；有的门口的牌子数量，多得叫人吃惊。不过这只是耳闻，这次我到武汉，却有幸目睹了。
    一个机关门旁往往挂着一长溜牌子，起初我还以为是一个门里住有很多机关，但看多了之后，才知道完全是另外一回事。试举在一个
          机关门口所见到的牌子名目为例：“中国××公司湖北省公司”“中国共产党中国××公司湖北省公司支部”“中国××工会中国××公司湖北省公司基层委员会”“中苏友好协会中国××公司湖北省公司分会”“中国××公司湖北省公司人民检举接待室”“中国新民主主义青年团中国××公司湖北省公司总支委员会”“………”。
    我有点好奇，往门里又瞥了一眼，马上发现，收发室靠大门的墙下还躺着两块牌子。有一块面朝泥土背朝天，瞧不见字；另一块却是大模大样地仰卧着，上书大红字“中国体育协会中国××公司湖北省公司支会”。这两块牌子大概是没地方挂了才退居院内的，以后少不得还得在外面找一个容身之地。真是党、政、工、团，………样样齐全，各有其牌。
    这并非是罕见的现象。有一次我走到一个郊区的农村里，看见一个乡初级小学也挂了一整套牌子。学校的名称、团支部、教育工会基层委员会……都不去说它，还有一块最耀眼的大牌子，用朱红大字写着“中国少年先锋队××乡初级小学校大队部”。
    我们的机关，团体内部有党、团组织和各种群众组织，这是不言而喻的，这正像一个人有大脑、内脏、四肢……一样。假如有谁自作聪明，在身体各部贴上标签：“某某某的大脑”、“某某某的左手”、“某某某的右足”……旁人不说他是疯子，也得笑他是傻子。可是为什么一个机关挂上一长溜牌子，却被认为是合乎常情的常态呢？
