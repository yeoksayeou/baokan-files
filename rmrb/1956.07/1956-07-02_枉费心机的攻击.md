    Futile Attack
    U.S. Secretary of State Dulles recently delivered a speech at the graduation ceremony of Iowa State University, launching a vicious attack on the policy of neutrality currently pursued by some countries, describing neutralism as "increasingly obsolete" and "an immoral and short-sighted concept."
    Even Eisenhower has publicly stated that the neutral policy adopted by other countries does not harm the United States. So why are some powerful figures in the American ruling group so hostile to countries pursuing a policy of neutrality? This is because they are unwilling to coexist peacefully and do not want the international situation to ease. Therefore, they fear that many countries will take wise measures and implement their own independent foreign policies, making it impossible to organize aggressive American military blocs.
    Dulles' words are a complete reversal of black and white. The truly "increasingly obsolete," "immoral," and "short-sighted concepts" are the U.S. policy of strength and colonialism. In fact, these neutral countries have, to varying degrees, suffered from the U.S. big stick and colonial rule. These countries have learned profound and enormous lessons from practical experience and historical facts, recognized the trend of the world, abandoned the stinking policy of strength, bravely broken free from the shackles of colonialism, and begun to implement a political line of national independence, believing in the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, and taking the path they should take. This is precisely a new phenomenon and a new change on the international stage in recent years, but Dulles describes this vigorously developing new situation as a concept that has become increasingly obsolete. This is unfounded and is nonsense.
    Dulles' attacks on the policy of neutrality are actually not limited to this one time. The intention is nothing more than to attempt to intimidate neutral countries into changing their decisions.
    At present, the anti-American sentiment of people of all countries is unprecedentedly strong, and there is widespread resentment against the U.S. assembling military blocs everywhere. Even some capitalist countries such as Britain, France, and Canada have expressed deep dissatisfaction with the U.S. foreign policy. Even Thailand, which the United States has always called its most reliable ally in Southeast Asia, and Turkey, the most loyal ally in the Middle East, have recently felt anger and unease at the U.S.'s repeated violations of their sovereignty. Seeing that many countries are clamoring for peaceful coexistence and that the United States has fallen into an impasse, Dulles attempts to salvage the U.S. policy that has reached a dead end by attacking neutralism. However, this is a completely futile effort.

    枉费心机的攻击
    美国国务卿杜勒斯最近在衣阿华州立大学的毕业典礼上发表演说，对目前某些国家所执行的中立政策进行了恶毒的攻击，把中立主义说成是“日益陈旧的”而且“是不道德的和目光短浅的概念”。
    连艾森豪威尔也公开说过，其他国家采取中立政策并不损害美国。那末为什么美国统治集团中的一些有势力人物又要这样仇视执行中立政策的国家呢？这是因为他们不愿和平共处，不愿国际局势趋向缓和，因此唯恐许多国家采取明智措施，执行自己独立的外交政策，使美国的侵略性军事集团无法组织起来。
    杜勒斯的话是完全颠倒黑白的。真正“日益陈旧的”“不道德的和目光短浅的概念”，是美国的实力地位政策和殖民主义。事实上这些中立国家都曾或多或少地吃过美国大棒和殖民主义统治的苦头。这些国家从实际经验和历史事实中取得沉痛的巨大的教训，认识了世界潮流的趋势，唾弃臭气熏天的实力政策，勇敢地摆脱殖民主义的羁绊，而开始贯彻民族独立的政治路线，信奉和平共处的五项原则，走自己应走的道路。这正是近年来国际舞台上一种新的现象和新的变化，而杜勒斯却把这种蓬勃发展的新形势说成是已经日益成为陈旧的概念。这是毫无根据的，是一种无稽之谈。
    杜勒斯攻击中立政策实际上已不止一次了，用意无非是企图以恫吓方式使中立国家改变决策。
    目前，各国人民的反美情绪空前强烈，对美国到处拼凑军事集团怨声载道，连英国、法国和加拿大等这样一些资本主义国家对美国的外交政策也深表不满，甚至一向被美国称之为东南亚最可靠的盟友的泰国和中东最忠实的盟国的土耳其，最近对美国屡次侵犯他们主权的行为也感到愤慨与不安。杜勒斯眼看许多国家纷纷要求和平共处，美国已经陷于四面楚歌之中，企图用攻击中立主义来挽救已经走到死胡同尽头的美国政策。然而这是完全枉费心机的。
