    When will undershirts and vests be available?
    In the Cangzhen market of Cangxian County, Hebei Province, more than 30 kinds of daily necessities needed by the masses were out of stock some time ago, and there are still no undershirts or vests for sale. Someone asked: Why are even the seasonal goods that sell well in summer out of stock at the Cangzhen Department Store? Director Zhang of the department store's retail department replied with confidence: "We have no funds." Is it that there is no money, or is the money sleeping? Although the Cangxian County Department Store has thousands of goods, not many are suitable for the needs of the masses. If the company did not purchase these items that are not needed by the masses, but purchased what the masses urgently need, wouldn't there be funds? (Qian Wen)

    汗衫、背心何时有？
    河北省沧县沧镇市场上不久前曾有三十多种群众所需要的百杂货脱销，直到目前还没有汗衫、背心卖。有人问：沧镇百货公司为什么连夏季适销的商品都脱销呢？百货公司门市部张主任却理直气壮地答复：“我们没有资金。”是没有资金，还是资金在睡觉呢？虽然沧县百货公司货有千种，但是适合群众需要的并不多。如果公司不购进这些不为群众所需要的东西，而购进为群众迫切需要的东西，不是就有资金了吗？　（谦文）
