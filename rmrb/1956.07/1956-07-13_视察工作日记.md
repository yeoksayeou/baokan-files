Inspection Work Diary
    Zheng Yun

            May 24th, Thursday
    In the morning, I went to the Second Central Primary School in the Yimiao District to visit and learn about the handicraft labor situation of the primary school. As I approached the school, I saw not a school, but a bustling market. Many people were buying vegetables early in the morning, it was very crowded, and the ground was covered with stagnant water, as if it had just rained, making it difficult to walk. If it hadn't been for Comrade Tao Yunying, who had lived in Shanghai for a long time, as my guide, it would have been difficult for me to find the school gate. I said to Tao Yunying that I wanted to make a suggestion to the Shanghai Municipal Administration Bureau. There was a vegetable market in front of the First Teachers' Affiliated Primary School, and there was also a vegetable market in front of this school. This not only affected the cleanliness and hygiene of the school, but also made it inconvenient for the children to walk to and from school, and it was also unsightly. It would be best to move the vegetable market. I hoped she would pass on my opinion. She laughed, feeling that everything was clearer to onlookers than to those involved, and after a long time, they would take it for granted.
    This is a large primary school with more than thirty classes and more than two thousand students. The space for the children to move around is not enough. While I was talking to the principal, the students' morning exercises began, and the corridors on each floor and the courtyard were filled with students.
    I listened to an arithmetic class for the fourth grade. The teaching content was about the relationship between distance, speed, and time. I felt that these kinds of arithmetic problems were relatively distant from the children's lives and difficult to understand. The textbook was also a bit too advanced, but the teacher explained it very clearly, and the teaching effect was very good.
    The handicraft labor class was taught by a science teacher. This class taught students how to make wooden airplanes, which would take four class periods. This was the last class. The teacher guided the students to install the finished parts according to their front and rear positions. The teacher's preparation work was very good, the explanation was very clear, and drawings were used to help explain the installation positions. At the same time, attention was paid to individual children, so that all students could meet the teaching requirements and complete the teaching tasks.
    After class, the principal said: "Handicraft labor classes started to be piloted in the fifth grade. The equipment is very poor, there are very few tools, and the workplace is also small. However, this teacher has a strong spirit of research and has created many teaching aids to supplement the lack of equipment and facilitate teaching." Hearing this, I paid my respects to the teacher and said, "I hope you will summarize your experience in creating various teaching aids so that everyone can refer to them." He smiled.
            May 25th, Friday
    In recent days, I have been visiting schools. This morning, I visited the Nanjing West Road Kindergarten. This is a large kindergarten with a total of eight classes of large, medium, and small sizes, with more than 250 children. The environment in the kindergarten is very beautiful. As soon as you enter, there is a pergola made of wisteria. The courtyard is surrounded by clusters of green holly trees, and there are various brightly colored flowers, decorated like a beautiful small park.
    After a short rest, I visited the large class's native language and drawing assignments. The educator was a young comrade. The drawing assignment was object drawing, requiring children to draw distant trees and near trees. The children's imagination was very rich. They not only met the educator's requirements, but also added various different contents according to their own imagination. For example, some children drew a winding river between two trees, and there were ducks pecking at small fish in the river. The layout of the picture was very appropriate, and the images were vivid and interesting.
    The children's outdoor games were very interesting. A group of children from the large class were playing house. The child acting as the father was a very organized child. He would assign his children to set the table, place the tableware, and put out snacks. In order to entertain the visiting guests from Beijing for dinner, they creatively used building blocks and fruit pits as snacks, which were arranged in a colorful way, very beautiful. The director of the garden and I were their guests. After we finished eating, we thanked the little hosts and went to visit the middle class's games. Several children in the middle class were building游船 with large building blocks. The child acting as the captain enthusiastically invited me to get on the boat. I really sat on their boat. The captain was very enthusiastic, always sticking to his post, and taking care of the guests thoughtfully. I had a lot of fun playing with these lovely children. The children's creative ability in the game, their rich and colorful life, and the excellent qualities they showed in the game gave me a deep impression.
    The work of educators in Shanghai is relatively arduous. Each class has almost forty children, and some even exceed this number; however, there are very few educators. Each full-day kindergarten class only has one educator. At a seminar, the educators reflected that they did not have a moment of free time throughout the day, and it was even difficult to find time to drink water. I once suggested to the Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau that each kindergarten should have at least one childcare worker for every two classes in order to ensure that the educators have time to study, prepare lessons, and rest.
              May 28th, Monday
    Today, a symposium of primary school principals was held. At the meeting, the principals reflected that the most distressing thing was the phenomenon of being busy and chaotic.
              May 29th, Tuesday
    I did not go out to inspect today, and I sorted out and studied some of the materials collected from the two symposia.
    At present, the excessive number of teacher and principal meetings, concurrent positions, and social activities has become an obstacle to further improving the quality of education, and this should be paid attention to. Therefore, I would like to suggest that the educational administrative departments should solve this problem from the aspects of unified leadership; strengthening planning; improving working methods; reducing meetings; focusing on teaching; and rationally using manpower and allocating time in order to ensure that teachers have sufficient time to prepare lessons and ensure the health of teachers, in order to further improve the quality of education.
                                  (The end)

    视察工作日记
    郑芸
            五月二十四日　星期四
    上午，到邑庙区第二中心小学去参观，了解小学的手工劳动的情况。快要到学校的时候，我看见的不是学校，而是一片热闹的市场。清晨买菜的人很多，十分拥挤，地面上污水淤积，像刚下过雨似的，走起路来很不方便。假若不是久居上海的陶云婴同志做向导，我是很难找到学校大门的。我对陶云婴说，我要对上海市政管理局提意见了，一师附小门口是菜市场，这个学校门口也是菜市场，既影响学校的清洁卫生，小朋友们上学校来回走路也很不方便，而且也有碍观瞻，最好能把菜市场迁移一下，希望她转达我的意见。她笑了，觉得什么事都是“旁观者清，当局者迷”，日久天长，就处之泰然了。
    这是一个大型的小学，有三十多个班，两千多学生，孩子们活动的场地是不够的。我正在和校长谈话的时候，学生的早操开始了，每层楼走廊上和庭院里，都站满了学生。
    我听了一节四年级算术课，教学内容是讲述距离、速度和时间的关系。这种算题，我觉得对儿童生活距离比较远，是难以理解的，教材也比较深了些，不过教师讲解得很清楚，教学效果很好。
    手工劳动课是由自然科教师兼任的。这节课教学生学做木质的小飞机，要用四个教时，这是最后一节了。教师指导学生把已经做好了的零件，按前后的位置安装起来。教师准备工作做的很好，讲述非常清楚，并且用画图来辅助说明安装的位置，同时注意到个别儿童，这样就能使全体学生达到教学的要求，完成教学任务。
    课后，校长说：手工劳动课，在五年级开始试验，设备很差，工具很少，工作的场所也小，不过这位老师钻研精神很强，创造了许多教具，以补充设备的不足，便利了教学。听到这里，我对这位教师当面致敬意，并且说：“希望您把创造各种教具的经验总结出来，好供大家参考”。他笑了。
            五月二十五日　星期五
    在最近这些日子里，我参观的都是些学校。今天上午，参观了南京西路幼儿园，这是一所大型的幼儿园，全园共分大、中、小八个班，有250多个小朋友。园内环境非常美丽，一进门就是一架藤萝搭成的天棚。庭院周围环绕着丛绿的冬青树，并且有各种色彩鲜艳的花卉，装饰得像一座美丽的小公园。
    休息一会，我就参观大班的本族语言和图画作业，教养员是一位青年同志。图画作业是画物体画，要求儿童能画出远的树和近的树。孩子们的想像力很丰富，他们不但能达到教养员的要求，而且根据自己的想像增加了各种不同的内容。如有的小朋友在两棵树的中间，画上了弯曲的小河，河上还有小鸭子在啄食小鱼。画面布局很适当，形象生动有趣。
    孩子们的户外游戏十分有趣。一个大班的孩子们正在玩娃娃家，做爸爸的是一位组织能力很强的小朋友，他会分配他的孩子们布置餐桌、摆餐具，放点心。为了招待北京的参观客人吃饭，他们创造性地利用积木、果核等当做点心，五光十色地配备起来，非常好看。我和园主任都作了他们的客人。我们吃完饭谢过小主人，又到中班参观游戏。中班的几个小朋友正在用大型积木建筑游船。充当船长的小朋友很热情地约我坐船，我真的坐在他们的船上了，船长非常热心，一直坚守着他的岗位，并周到地照料着客人。我和这些可爱的孩子在一起玩，觉得很有意思，孩子们在游戏中的创造能力，他们丰富多彩的生活，以及他们在游戏当中表现的优良的品德，给了我很深的印象。
    上海市教养员的工作是比较艰苦的。每班幼儿人数差不多都有四十人，有的还超过这个数目；但是教养员却很少，整日制幼儿园每班只有一位教养员。在一次座谈会上，教养员反映：一天没有一点空闲时间，甚至喝水的时间都难找到。我曾经向上海市教育局建议，幼儿园的编制最低限度两个班应当有一位保育员，以便保证教养员有学习、备课、休息的时间。
              五月二十八日　星期一
    今天举行了小学校长座谈会。在会上，校长们反映最苦恼的是忙乱现象。
              五月二十九日　星期二
    今天没有出去视察，将两次座谈会所搜集的材料做了些整理和研究。
    目前教师、校长会议、兼职、社会活动过多的现象，已经成了进一步提高教育质量的障碍，应该加以重视。因此我想建议教育行政部门要从统一领导；加强计划性，改进工作方法，缩减会议，面向教学，合理地使用人力，合理地调配时间等方面，解决这个问题，以保证教师们有充分的时间备课，保证教师们的健康，以期进一步提高教育质量。
