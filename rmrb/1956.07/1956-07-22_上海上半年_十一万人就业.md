Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, July 21st: In the first half of this year, Shanghai's labor administrative departments organized and allocated 110,000 unemployed and jobless people to participate in national construction projects. This number of employed people exceeds that of any previous year.

Most of these 110,000 people went to the interior and border regions to participate in construction. Some went to Xi'an and Lanzhou to participate in basic construction and municipal construction projects; many became builders of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway. Many educated young people went to the Qaidam Basin, Xinjiang, Shaanxi, and Sichuan to participate in petroleum exploration. With the increasing industrial production tasks and the development of cultural and educational undertakings in Shanghai this year, a large number of unemployed and jobless people have also found employment in the city.

Among the 110,000 people employed in the first half of the year, more than 30,000 were middle-aged unemployed people who lacked skills and education in the old society and had poor employment prospects. This year, they gained employment opportunities due to the needs of construction projects in various regions. More than 50,000 were young people with higher primary and junior secondary education levels, some of whom had dropped out of school before liberation, and some of whom did not pass the entrance exams after liberation due to their poor academic performance. Now, they have all joined industrial production, geological exploration, and cultural and educational departments.

    上海上半年
    十一万人就业
    据新华社上海21日讯　今年上半年，上海市劳动行政部门有组织地调配了十一万失业无业人员参加国家建设事业。这个就业人员的数字超过了以往任何一年。
    这十一万人大部分是到内地和边疆参加建设的。有的到西安和兰州参加基本建设和市政建设工程；有许多人成了宝成铁路的建设者。很多知识青年前往柴达木盆地、新疆、陕西和四川等地参加石油勘探工作。随着今年上海工业生产任务的加重和文教事业的发展，上半年也有大量的失业无业人员在本市就业。
    上半年就业的十一万人中，有三万多人是在旧社会里就没有技术和文化，就业条件较差的失业中年人，今年因为各地建设工程的需要而获得了就业的机会。有五万多人是具有高小和初中文化程度的青年，有的在解放以前就失了学，有的是解放后因学识较差，没有考上学校。现在，他们都参加了工业生产、地质勘探和文教部门的工作。
