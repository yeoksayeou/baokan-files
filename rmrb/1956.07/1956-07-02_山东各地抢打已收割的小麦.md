Xinhua News Agency, Jinan: Shandong Province has experienced continuous rainfall in recent days. Although wheat in the lower reaches of the Yellow River, the Yimeng Mountain area, and along both sides of the Jiaoji Railway has been harvested, most of it is piled on the threshing grounds and has not yet been threshed. In order to prevent and reduce spoilage of this wheat, Party and government leading organs in these areas have dispatched a large number of cadres to go deep into the various agricultural production cooperatives to specifically help inspect and salvage the wheat.

    After inspecting the wheat and discovering it was heating up, twenty-nine agricultural cooperatives in seven townships, including Caobo Township in Gaomi County, immediately organized more than three thousand cooperative members to use various methods to thresh the wheat. In just one night, they threshed more than 123,000 jin of wheat and immediately distributed it to cooperative members for safekeeping.

    The vast agricultural cooperatives in the Jiaodong area, where the wheat harvest season is later, are also seizing the intervals between rains to organize cooperative members to rush harvest the ripening wheat day and night.

    山东各地抢打已收割的小麦
    据新华社济南电　山东省各地连日降雨，沿黄河下游地区、沂蒙山区和沿胶济铁路线两侧地区的小麦虽已收割完毕，但是大部分都堆放在打谷场上，尚未来得及脱粒。为了防止和减少这些小麦霉烂，这些地区的党政领导机关都派出了大批的干部，深入各个农业生产合作社具体帮助检查和抢救小麦。
    高密县草泊等七个乡的二十九个农业社，在检查小麦有发热的情况后，立即组织三千多名社员采用各种方法进行小麦脱粒，仅一个晚上就抢打小麦十二万三千多斤，并随即分给社员保管。
    麦收季节较晚的胶东地区的广大农业社，也正抓紧阴雨间隙，组织社员连夜抢收成熟的小麦。
