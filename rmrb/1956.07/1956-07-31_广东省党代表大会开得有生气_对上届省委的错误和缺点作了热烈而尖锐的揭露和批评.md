Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, July 30th: The first Congress of the Chinese Communist Party of Guangdong Province was held in Guangzhou from July 10th to 23rd.

　　Provincial Party Secretary Tao Zhu delivered a work report on behalf of the previous provincial party committee entitled "We Must Build Guangdong Well."

　　This congress better promoted democracy and unfolded criticism and self-criticism. The provincial party committee's work report first exposed and criticized the shortcomings and errors in its work, particularly focusing on the errors of one-sidedly emphasizing national and collective interests while not sufficiently considering the interests of the masses and individual interests, as well as the serious bureaucratic and subjectivist errors in the leadership of the provincial party committee. In group discussions and plenary speeches, the delegates warmly and sharply criticized the leadership of the provincial party committee and further exposed the shortcomings and errors in the work of the entire province.

　　All delegates agreed with the provincial party committee's report and unanimously believed that the previous provincial party committee had made achievements in leading the province in the three major transformations. To date, 95% of peasant households in the province have joined agricultural production cooperatives, with 45% of peasant households joining advanced cooperatives. It is expected that the socialist transformation of agriculture will be fully completed by this winter. Private industry has been completely transformed into joint state-private enterprises. 80% of urban and rural commerce has also been transformed into joint state-private enterprises. The number of members participating in handicraft production cooperatives has reached 81.5% of the total number of handicraft workers. In recent years, Guangdong's industrial and agricultural production has greatly developed. Comparing 1955 with 1949, the total value of industrial production has increased by 304.5%, rising from 19.54% of the total value of industrial and agricultural output to 32.97%. In agriculture, due to actively expanding the multiple cropping area, promoting advanced technologies, reforming the farming system, and carrying out large-scale farmland water conservancy projects, grain production has greatly increased in recent years. Especially this year, the first year of cooperation, judging from the harvest of the previous crop, the increase in grain production will definitely be able to complete the plan.

　　The criticisms raised by the congress regarding the shortcomings and errors in the leadership of the previous provincial party committee and the work of the entire province were mainly: the previous provincial party committee determined that the focus of Guangdong's work was to develop agricultural production, and although this policy was correct, in actual implementation, agriculture overwhelmed everything else, neglecting the leadership of industry, commerce, handicrafts, science, culture, and education, resulting in local industries failing to serve agriculture well, the emergence of many illegal and disciplinary violations in commerce, affecting people's lives and the development of agricultural production itself. For example, in agricultural production, the provincial party committee overemphasized the production of rice, so that many economic crops with great economic and export value did not develop sufficiently, and some small amount of economic crops even decreased in production, affecting export trade and the supply of raw materials for industry and handicraft production, reducing national income and affecting the lives of farmers.

　　Due to the provincial party committee's excessive demands for increasing grain production, and the adoption of too many restrictions and rigid leadership methods for lower-level party committees, without taking good care of the different specific conditions and special conditions in various places, and fully developing the local deployment of their own production work in accordance with local conditions, but generally proposing the requirement to increase rice production as the main task, so that in recent years, farmers in some mountainous areas who used to grow miscellaneous grains also switched to growing rice, resulting in very high labor costs but low yields, greatly reducing the income of farmers in mountainous areas and causing difficulties in their lives. Not enough emphasis was placed on the development of tropical economic crops in Hainan Island, and the island was asked to achieve self-sufficiency in grain too quickly, resulting in many farmers on the island increasing grain production but reducing their income. The Leizhou Peninsula is fundamentally short of water and also lacks the means to fundamentally change the situation of gaining more than they lose by planting rice by adopting a variety of dry land crops in accordance with local conditions, so that this year the local cooperative's hope of increasing income is not very great, affecting the consolidation of the cooperative movement.

　　The congress also pointed out the shortcomings of the previous provincial party committee in specifically leading agricultural production. Because the previous provincial party committee was not familiar enough with the agricultural production situation in various parts of the province, the deployment of work was too general, often requiring the same implementation of a requirement or a measure throughout the province. For example, advocating early sowing and early transplanting was originally correct, but the previous provincial party committee indiscriminately required all parts of the province to complete transplanting rice seedlings around Guyu (Grain Rain), which inevitably led to some places with large differences in production seasons violating the local agricultural season after implementation, so that when most areas of the province had a bumper harvest of rice production, there was an abnormal phenomenon of very poor harvests in some areas.

　　The congress also focused on criticizing the serious error of the previous provincial party committee in the past two years in grain purchase, which was seriously detached from the masses and had a one-sided national viewpoint, which alienated the party and the government from the masses to a considerable extent. In the past two years, due to the provincial party committee's work style being not in-depth and unable to listen to the opinions of the lower levels, thinking that the initial grain purchase situation was very good and optimistic, the 1954 grain purchase figures increased too much, causing a considerable number of farmers to sell a portion of their rations, and when farmers needed grain, they rigidly adhered to the sales targets, making the rural grain problem even more tense. The development of rural sideline production also suffered great losses as a result. Although this situation has changed greatly this year, the lesson is very painful.

　　In addition, delegates from various places also criticized the previous provincial party committee for the errors of "indecision" and "changing orders frequently" in some issues. For example, the provincial party committee had publicly announced that wheat would not be purchased, and only allowed rice to be exchanged for wheat (one jin for one jin), but later it purchased some, and the exchange of rice for wheat was not resolutely implemented until the masses had opinions before it was resolutely implemented. Another example is the number of feed retained by farmers, which also changed repeatedly. These have damaged the prestige of the party and the government and made it difficult for lower-level cadres to work.

　　The congress believed that the cause of these shortcomings and errors was due to the existence of a fairly serious subjectivist and bureaucratic work style in the provincial party committee, and that some responsible cadres of the provincial party committee had developed a sense of complacency due to the achievements made in Guangdong's work, coupled with a very poor democratic work style, which made it impossible to quickly and timely correct the shortcomings and errors in the work.

　　The congress also pointed out that another reason for the existence of many shortcomings and errors in the previous provincial party committee was the lack of separation between the party and the government. The provincial party committee was busy issuing orders and directly contracting administrative affairs, which made the provincial party committee trapped in daily busy affairs and had no time and energy to consider important issues in all aspects of the province. For example, commercial work has had many problems due to not receiving good care and attention from the provincial party committee, such as the universal existence of too many circulation links and huge commercial costs in commercial institutions throughout the province, resulting in high commodity prices; some commercial industries have excessive profits, making some agricultural products sold in rural areas increase by half or even several times between transfers, harming the interests of farmers; and many purchasing units arbitrarily lowered purchase prices. This illegal and disciplinary behavior has not been dealt with in a timely manner, which has seriously affected urban-rural relations and worker-peasant unity.

　　The congress also criticized the shortcomings and errors of the previous provincial party committee in various aspects such as overseas Chinese affairs, coastal fishermen affairs, ethnic minority affairs, united front work, mountainous area work, and cultural and educational work. The previous provincial party committee expressed its sincere acceptance of the criticisms and suggestions put forward at the congress.

　　Finally, the congress elected a new CPC Guangdong Provincial Committee. The delegates to the congress conducted serious and relatively full discussions on the list of candidates submitted by the presidium and made some revisions. As a result, forty-one full members and fifteen alternate members were elected, and twenty-eight delegates and three alternate delegates to the Eighth National Congress of the CPC were also elected.

    广东省党代表大会开得有生气
    对上届省委的错误和缺点作了热烈而尖锐的揭露和批评
    据新华社广州30日电　中国共产党广东省第一次代表大会于七月十日到二十三日在广州市举行。
    省委书记陶铸代表上届省委向大会作了题为“一定要把广东建设好”的工作报告。
    这次大会较好地发扬了民主，展开了批评和自我批评。省委的工作报告首先对工作中的缺点和错误进行了揭露和批评，特别集中地批评了片面强调国家利益和集体利益而对群众利益、个体利益照顾不够的错误，以及省委领导上严重的官僚主义与主观主义的错误。在小组讨论与大会发言中，代表们热烈而尖锐地对省委的领导提出了许多批评和意见，并且对全省工作中的缺点和错误作了进一步的揭露。
    全体代表同意省委的报告，一致认为上届省委在领导全省进行三大改造的工作上是有成绩的。到目前为止，全省已有95％的农户加入了农业生产合作社，其中加入高级社的农户已占总农户的45％，预计到今年冬天即可全部完成农业的社会主义改造。私营工业已全部实行公私合营。城乡商业也已有80％实行了公私合营。参加手工业生产合作社的社员人数已达手工业者总数的81.5％。这几年来，广东的工农业生产都有很大发展，若以1955年与1949年比较，工业生产总值增加了304.5％，已由原来只占工农总产值19.54％提高到32.97％。农业方面由于积极地扩大复种面积、推广先进技术、改革耕作制度和大规模兴修农田水利等，几年来粮食生产有很大提高。特别是今年合作化的第一年，从上造的收成来看，粮食增产肯定可以完成计划。
    大会对上届省委的领导和全省工作中的缺点和错误所提出的批评，主要是：上届省委确定广东省的工作重心是发展农业生产，这一方针虽然是正确的，但在实际执行中把农业压倒了一切，忽视了对工业、商业、手工业、科学文教事业等方面的领导，造成了地方工业未能很好为农业服务，商业上出现很多违法乱纪现象，影响到人民生活和农业生产本身的发展。再如在农业生产上，省委又过分强调了稻谷的生产，使很多极有经济价值和出口价值的经济作物发展不够，某些少量的经济作物甚至减产，影响到出口贸易和工业、手工业生产的原料供应，减少了国家的收入，也影响了农民的生活。
    由于省委对增加粮食生产的过分要求，并且对下级党委采取了过多的限制与硬性规定的领导方式，没有很好照顾各地不同的具体情况和特殊条件，充分发挥下面因地制宜地去部署各自的生产工作，而是一般化的提出以增加稻谷生产为主要任务的要求，以至近年来某些山区的农民向来种杂粮的也改种了水稻，结果工本很高而收获量很低，使山区农民收入大为减少，生活发生困难。对海南岛强调发展热带经济作物不够，过急地要求这个岛粮食做到自给，结果使岛上不少农民虽然增产了粮食，但是收入却减少了。雷州半岛根本缺水，也缺乏因地制宜采取多种旱地作物的办法来根本改变当地种稻谷得不偿失的情况，以致今年当地合作社增加收入的希望不很大，影响到合作化运动的巩固。
    大会又指出了上届省委在具体领导农业生产上的缺点。由于上届省委对全省各地农业生产的情况不够熟悉，在布置工作时过于一般化，常常是一个要求、一个措施却要全省各地同样执行，如提倡早播早插本来是对的，但上届省委不加区别地要求全省各地都要在谷雨前后插完秧，就不能不使生产节令相差很大的一些地方在执行后违背了当地的农时，以致当全省大部地区稻谷生产丰收的时候，又出现了某些地区非常歉收的反常现象。
    大会还着重批评了上届省委在以往两年在收购粮食问题上所犯过的严重脱离群众的片面的国家观点的错误，它使党和政府在相当程度上远离了群众。在最近两年来，由于省委工作作风的不深入和不能倾听下面的意见，以为开始购粮的情况很好，很乐观，1954年购粮数字增加过多，使相当一部分的农民卖出了一部分口粮，而当农民需粮的时候，又死扣销售指标不放，使农村粮食问题更形紧张。农村副业生产的发展也由此受到很大的损失。这种情况今年虽然已有很大改变，但这个教训是很沉痛的。
    此外，各地代表还批评了上届省委在某些问题上存在过“举棋不定”和“朝令夕改”的错误，如省委曾公开宣传过小麦不收购，只许以大米换小麦（一斤换一斤），但后来又收购了一些，以米换小麦也执行得不坚决，直到后来群众有意见才坚决执行。又如关于农民留饲料的数目，也一变再变。这些都使党和政府的威信受到损害，也使下面干部很难工作。
    大会认为造成这些缺点和错误的原因，是由于省委存在着相当严重的主观主义和官僚主义作风，而省委的一些负责干部由于广东省的工作做出了若干成绩，滋长着一种自满情绪，再加民主作风很差，就使工作中的缺点和错误不能得到迅速和及时的纠正。
    大会还指出了造成上届省委存在众多缺点和错误的另一原因，是在于党政不分，省委忙于发号施令，直接包揽行政业务，使省委陷入日常的繁忙事务中，没有时间和精力去考虑全省各方面的重要问题。例如商业工作就由于没有得到省委很好的关心和注意而发生了很多问题，如全省商业机构普遍存在着流转环节太多，商业费用浩大，造成商品价格高昂；有些商业行业的利润过高，使一些在农村销售的农产品在转手之间涨了一半甚至好几倍，损害了农民的利益；还有很多收购单位随意压低收购价格，这种违法乱纪的行为未能及时处理，已经严重地影响到城乡关系和工农团结。
    大会还对上届省委在华侨工作、沿海渔民工作、少数民族工作、统一战线工作、山区工作、文教工作等各方面存在的缺点和错误进行了批评。对于大会上提出的批评和建议，上届省委都表示诚恳接受。
    大会最后选举了新的中共广东省委员会。大会代表们对主席团提出的候选名单进行了认真的和比较充分的讨论，并作了部分修改。结果选举出正式委员四十一人，候补委员十五人，还选出了出席中共第八次全国代表大会的代表二十八人和候补代表三人。
