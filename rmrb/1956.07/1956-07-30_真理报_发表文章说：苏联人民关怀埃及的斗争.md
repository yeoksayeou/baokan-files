Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, July 29th. "Pravda" today published an article by Kraminov stating: The Soviet people sympathetically watch the Egyptian people's struggle for freedom and independence.

Kraminov pointed out: The nationalization of the Suez Canal has caused an uproar. Frantic talks have taken place between the capitals of Britain, the United States, and France. Western politicians and newspaper commentators completely ignore the fact that Egypt's measures are legitimate and reasonable. In recent days, the British newspapers have exhausted all sorts of words to attack the head of a country that maintains normal relations with Britain, words that could only be used to scold Britain's enemies in wartime. Among all the British newspapers, only "The Yorkshire Post" – incidentally, a newspaper close to Prime Minister Eden – pointed out that Egypt has a perfectly legitimate basis for nationalizing the Suez Canal.

The article went on to point out that the Egyptian people's resolute and tireless struggle to consolidate their country's independence has won the warm sympathy of the masses of people in various countries. Egypt's example of eradicating the remnants of colonialism has inspired the people of other colonial and dependent countries to fight for freedom and independence.

The article concluded by saying that the Soviet public is convinced that no military threats, economic pressures, or political blackmail can stop the national liberation movement in the former colonies and dependent countries. Anyone who does not understand this or attempts to act against the will of the people will become a laughingstock to the whole world.

    “真理报”发表文章说：苏联人民关怀埃及的斗争
    据新华社莫斯科29日电　“真理报”今天刊登了克拉米诺夫写的一篇文章说：苏联人民同情地注视着埃及人民争取自由和独立的斗争。
    克拉米诺夫指出：苏彝士运河国有化的问题引起了一片喧哗。英、美、法三国的首都之间进行了发了狂似的会谈。西方国家的政界人物和报纸评论员根本不理会埃及的措施是合法合理的。最近这些天来，英国报纸用尽种种字眼去攻击一个同英国保持正常关系的国家的元首，这些字眼也只有在战时对英国的敌人才骂得出来。所有英国报纸中，只有“约克郡邮报”一家——顺便说，这是接近首相艾登的一家报纸——指出，埃及完全有合法的根据把苏彝士运河收归国有。
    这篇文章接着指出，埃及人民为巩固本国的独立而坚决不倦地进行的斗争，博得了各国人民群众的热烈同情。埃及铲除殖民主义残余的榜样，鼓舞了其他殖民地国家和附属国的人民去争取自由和独立。
    这篇文章最后说，苏联公众深信，任何军事上的威胁、经济上的压力、政治上的讹诈都不可能阻止旧日的殖民地和附属国的民族解放运动。谁不明白这点或者企图逆着人民的意志硬干，就会变成整个世界的笑柄。
