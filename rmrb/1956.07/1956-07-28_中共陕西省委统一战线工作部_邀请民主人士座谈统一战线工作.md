Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, July 27th: The United Front Work Department of the Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China invited more than 120 responsible persons of democratic parties and democratic personages in Shaanxi Province to a symposium on July 24th to solicit opinions on the United Front work. The symposium was presided over by Zhang Desheng, First Secretary of the Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China. He asked everyone to freely express their criticisms of the shortcomings and problems existing in the United Front work in order to improve the work and strengthen unity.

Democratic personages attending the meeting actively expressed their opinions. Han Zhao'e, Deputy Governor of Shaanxi Province and Chairman of the Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the China Democratic League, said: The Communist Party organizations provide more care for democratic parties and democratic personages in life but less help in politics and work, and there is a lack of criticism and self-criticism of non-Party members.

Sun Weiru, Vice Chairman of the Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and Chairman of the Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, said: The relationship between people must be further harmonious and must be based on mutual understanding. If Communist Party members and non-Party members only meet in the office and meeting place, and rarely contact each other at other times, it is not easy to know each other. In the future, Communist Party members and democratic party members should have more contact in their spare time and talk freely so that it is easy to understand each other, enhance feelings, strengthen unity, and do a good job. Han Wangchen, Chairman of the Shaanxi Provincial Federation of Industry and Commerce, pointed out in his speech that the Communist Party organizations do not provide enough specific help to the Federation of Industry and Commerce, and sometimes relevant agencies do not send people to participate in guidance when the Federation of Industry and Commerce holds meetings. During the high tide of the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce, the work of the Federation of Industry and Commerce was very busy, and there were many problems, but the relevant agencies did not provide enough guidance and assistance, and this situation should be changed in the future. In addition, some democratic personages also raised criticisms and suggestions about the shortcomings of some Communist Party members not respecting the powers of non-Party members enough, making arbitrary decisions, and being unwilling to consult with non-Party members on handling affairs.

    邀请民主人士座谈统一战线工作
    据新华社西安27日电　中共陕西省委员会统一战线工作部在七月二十四日邀请陕西省各民主党派负责人和民主人士一百二十多人举行座谈会，征求对统一战线工作的意见。座谈会由中共陕西省委员会第一书记张德生主持。他请大家对统一战线工作中存在的缺点和毛病，畅所欲言地提出批评，以改进工作，加强团结。
    到会的民主人士都积极发表了意见。陕西省副省长、中国民主同盟陕西省委员会主任委员韩兆鹗说：中共组织对民主党派和民主人士生活上照顾多，政治上和工作上帮助少，对党外人士缺乏批评和自我批评。
    政协陕西省委员会副主席、中国国民党革命委员会陕西省委员会主任委员孙蔚如说：人与人的关系要进一步融洽，必须相知，如果共产党员与党外人士只在办公室、会场见面，平时很少联系，就不容易相知。今后共产党员与民主党派人士应该在工余之暇多接触，随便谈心，那才容易互相了解，增进情感，加强团结，做好工作。陕西省工商业联合会主任委员韩望尘在发言中指出，中共组织对工商联的具体帮助不够，有时工商联开会，有关机关也不派人参加指导。在资本主义工商业社会主义改造高潮中，工商联的工作很忙，问题也很多，有关机关也没有给以足够的指导和帮助，今后应该改变这种情况。此外，有些民主人士在发言中，还对有些共产党员对党外人士的职权尊重不够、有事独断独行以及不愿同党外人士商量办事等缺点提出了批评和建议。
