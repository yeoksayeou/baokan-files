Western Countries Intensify Threats Against Egypt
Suez Canal Company Does Not Recognize Egyptian Decision
British and French Governments Announce Freezing of Egyptian Assets in Britain and France

Xinhua News Agency, July 29th: Paris dispatch: The Board of Directors of the Suez Canal Company, composed mainly of British and French members, held a three-hour meeting in Paris on July 28th, after which it announced that it does not recognize the Egyptian government's measure to nationalize the canal. It said that anyone who pays the fees for ships passing through the canal to the Egyptian government will not be considered to have settled accounts with the company.

Xinhua News Agency, July 29th: London dispatch: The British government announced on July 28th the freezing of all Egyptian assets, both public and private, in Britain, including sterling balances.

On the same day, the British government also issued an order prohibiting anyone residing in Britain from returning any cash, securities, or other property belonging to the Suez Canal Company to Egypt.

Xinhua News Agency, July 29th: Paris dispatch: The French government today followed Britain in announcing the freezing of all Egyptian funds in France, as a retaliatory measure against Egypt's nationalization of the Suez Canal.

According to United Press, this freezing action appears to be a symbolic measure. French Foreign Minister Pineau himself said last week that France's assets in Egypt totaled 450 billion francs (approximately $1,285,000,000), while Egypt's assets in France were "negligible."

    西方国家加紧向埃及进行威胁
    苏彝士运河公司不承认埃及的决定
    英法政府宣布冻结埃及在英法财产
    据新华社29日讯　巴黎消息：主要是由英国人和法国人组成的苏彝士运河公司董事会七月二十八日在巴黎举行了一个历时三小时的会议，会后宣布，它不承认埃及政府把运河收归国有的措施。它说，任何人把船只通过运河的费用交给埃及政府，并不被认为已经同公司方面进行了结算。
    新华社29日讯　伦敦消息：英国政府七月二十八日宣布冻结埃及在英国的公私财产，包括英镑结余在内。
    同一天，英国政府还颁布命令，禁止在英国居住的任何一个人把属于苏彝士运河公司的现款、证券或其他财产交还埃及。
    据新华社29日讯　巴黎消息：法国政府今天继英国之后宣布冻结埃及在法国的全部资金，作为对付埃及把苏彝士运河收归国有的报复性措施。
    据合众社报道，这个冻结行动看来是一个象征性措施。法国外交部长比诺自己上周曾经说，法国在埃及的资产共有四千五百亿法郎
  （约合1，285，000，000美元），而埃及在法国的资产是“微不足道的”。
