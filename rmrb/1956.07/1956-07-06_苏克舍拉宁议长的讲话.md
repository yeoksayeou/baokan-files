Mr. Chairman of the Standing Committee, ladies and gentlemen!

The Finnish parliamentary delegation has been in China for two weeks. During this time, we Finnish parliamentarians have seen and learned so many new things that we have had to recall our childhood to find a period in which we could learn as much in such a short period of time.

Your distant country has become closer to us, and we have seen the Chinese people at work in their daily lives, and we have also met them at banquets. We believe that our understanding of the Chinese people and their efforts is very different from what we had imagined at home.

Throughout our visit, we have been deeply moved by the special friendship shown to us by the Chinese people—from national leaders to ordinary workers and farmers. If our country were a large country and our nation a powerful nation, we could understand this friendship. We would say it is international etiquette or a form of diplomacy. But our country is a small country, and our nation is a small nation, so it is difficult for us to find an explanation on the above basis. The only conclusion is that the enthusiasm we have received is a rare and genuine friendship in the world, regardless of whether this friendship can produce direct benefits, it is a sincere effort to promote the great cause of mutual understanding between nations. This understanding has made our stay here very pleasant, and it has also taught us to love this people who have suffered so much and are struggling to overcome difficulties.

We are delighted that so many important national figures and so many friends of New China are present today. We are also happy to spend this evening with you again before our departure.

Please allow me to take this opportunity to thank you for your kindness. During these days, Chairman Mao Zedong, Chairman of the Standing Committee Liu Shaoqi, Premier Zhou Enlai, and many others have asked us for our critical opinions, but we do not feel that we are mature enough, because what we see before us is a completely new world that is unfamiliar to us. The social development here is also unfamiliar to us. I don't think my own views are mature enough yet, but I would like to offer a view that is easy for guests to think of. During this period of great reform, your country needs to emulate foreign models in many ways. We Finns particularly admire your skill in choosing seeds that are suitable for growing in the soil of Chinese culture. We Finns are also working hard in our own country to maintain the characteristics and uniqueness of our culture. Therefore, we are very happy when we see how you are adopting modern inventions or scientific achievements according to the Chinese situation, without damaging the ancient characteristics that are suitable for the Chinese situation and the habits of the Chinese people. It should be pointed out that there is no attempt to imitate Western culture here, but to build a modern industrialized society on the basis of thousands of years of ancient culture. This is a great task that is not only beneficial to you and your country, but also to the culture of all mankind. We sincerely congratulate you on your achievements in this great task.

For the further consolidation of friendship between the Chinese and Finnish people,

To the health of Chairman Mao Zedong, cheers!

    苏克舍拉宁议长的讲话
    我们尊敬的常务委员长先生，女士们，先生们！
    芬兰议会代表团到达中国已经两个星期了。在这期间，我们芬兰的议会议员见到了、学到了这样多的新事物，以致于我们为了找到一个在同样短促的时间内能学到同样多的新事物的时期，不得不一直回忆到童年时代。
    你们遥远的国家同我们更加亲近了，我们看到了中国人民在进行日常工作，同时也在欢宴席上会见了中国人民。我们认为，我们对中国人民和他们的努力的了解，同我们过去在家里所想像的截然不同。
    在全部参观访问期间，我们异常重视中国人民——上自国家领导人乃至普通工人农民——对我们所表现的特别的友情。如果我们的国家是一个大国，我们的民族是一个强大的民族的话，那么我们是能够理解这种友情的。我们会说这是国际礼节，或者是外交形式。但是我们的国家是一个小国，我们的民族是一个人数不多的民族，因此，我们就很难在上述的基础上寻求解说。结论只能是，我们所受到的热情是世界上少有的、真正的友谊，不管这种友情能否产生直接的利益，这是为了促进国际间相互了解的伟大事业而作的真诚努力。这一认识使我们能在这里过得非常愉快，它也教导了我们去热爱这个曾遭受过许多苦难而正在为克服困难而进行斗争的人民。
    我们对今天有这样多的国家重要人物，这样多的新中国朋友光临此地而感到高兴。我们也为在离别之前能与诸位再次渡过这个晚上感到喜悦。
    请允许我借此机会感谢你们的盛意，在这些日子里，贵国的毛泽东主席，常务委员会刘少奇委员长，周恩来总理和其他许多人士曾要求我们提出批评的意见，但我们觉得还没有成熟，因为在我们眼前的是一个完全崭新的，对我们说来是生疏的世界。这里的社会发展情况，对我们来说，也是生疏的。我自己的看法，还不能认为已经很成熟，但我愿意提出一个客人们易于想到的看法。在巨大的改革时期里，你们的国家需要在许多方面效法外国的榜样。我们芬兰人特别钦佩你们选择适合于在中国文化土地上生长的种子的技能。我们芬兰人也正在自己的国家里，为保持自己文化的特点和独特性而努力。因此，当我们看到你们如何在根据中国的情况采用近代的发明或科学成就，而并不损坏古老的，适合中国情况和中国人民习惯的特性的时候，感到很大的高兴。应该指出，在这里并没有模仿西方文化的企图，而是在几千年古老文化的基础上建设现代工业化社会。这是一个不仅有利于你们和你们的国家，而且有利于全人类文化的伟大任务。我们衷心祝贺你们在这一伟大的任务中获得成就。
    为中芬两国人民间的友谊进一步巩固，
    为毛泽东主席健康干杯。
