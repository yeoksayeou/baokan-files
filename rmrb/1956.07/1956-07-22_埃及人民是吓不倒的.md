The Egyptian Ambassador to the United States, Hussein, said in Washington on the 17th of this month that Egypt had decided to accept Western aid to build the Aswan Dam on the Nile and hoped to negotiate a final financial agreement as soon as possible. Only three days after Hussein's speech, the US State Department announced that the US government did not consider it practically feasible to participate in the construction of the Aswan Dam project in Egypt at this time, and therefore rejected Egypt's proposal.

This incident clearly illustrates what American aid to backward countries means. The Aswan Dam is a crucial construction project for developing Egypt's national economy. Last December, the United States suggested to Egypt that it was willing to assist in the construction of the dam project and provide $56 million for the first phase. At the same time, the United States vigorously publicized the so-called "danger" of economically backward countries accepting Soviet aid. In the words of the "New York Herald Tribune," the United States did this in order to "prevent the Soviet Union from participating in a project that every Egyptian dreams of."

In plain terms, the United States wanted to use this "aid" to trap Egypt, control its economic lifeline, and force Egypt to change its current policy of peace and independence, in order to eventually turn Egypt into a US colony. The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, controlled by the United States, once expressed its willingness to provide Egypt with a $200 million loan to build the dam, on the condition that the Egyptian government allow it to establish some kind of "supervisory agency" to supervise Egypt's economic policy. This fully demonstrates the US conspiracy.

However, the Egyptian people have a backbone. They are unwilling to exchange their freedom for American money. The Egyptian "People's News" once said, "Egypt will reject any American aid if it requires Egypt to pay even the slightest bit of freedom for such aid." Despite US enticements, threats, and intimidation, Egypt has steadfastly pursued a policy of peace and independence, actively developing relations with the Soviet Union, China, and the People's Democracies, as well as other peace-loving countries, playing an increasingly important role in international affairs. All of this made the United States feel very uneasy. In particular, Egypt's formal recognition of China and the establishment of diplomatic relations with China in May this year aroused the frenzied anger of the US ruling clique. US congressmen and newspapers launched vicious attacks on Egypt's independent policy. The United States felt hopeless about using dollars to buy Egypt's independence.

When enticement failed, threats followed. At this time, American politicians immediately forgot all the sweet words they had said about helping backward countries develop their economies and revealed a ferocious face. Aid for the Aswan Dam project was cancelled. An Associated Press dispatch from New York used an intimidating tone, saying that this US action was "the prelude to a change in Western policies towards Arab countries, which will have a major impact on Nasser's leadership." In other words, the United States aimed to exert strong pressure on Egypt, create difficulties for the Egyptian government, and force Egypt to change its policies. It is foreseeable that the United States will take even more vicious measures to attack the Egyptian people and government.

However, the US ruling clique has forgotten that backward countries now have real friends, and they can obtain sincere and selfless assistance from these friends without losing a bit of independence and freedom. The days when the United States could manipulate backward countries with "aid" are long gone. The Egyptian people are people who "cannot be moved by poverty or subdued by force." They will not be intimidated by American threats. As long as they remain vigilant and adhere to independence, any US conspiracy will meet with a shameful defeat. The Egyptian people's beautiful aspiration to build their own country is bound to be realized. They will personally build the Aswan Dam on the Nile. When that time comes, let us see where those who are now baring their fangs and claws at the Egyptian people will be.

    埃及人民是吓不倒的
    丁好德
    埃及驻美大使侯赛尼本月十七日在华盛顿说，埃及已经决定接受西方援助，建筑尼罗河上的阿斯旺水坝，并且希望从速谈判，达成最后的财政协定。就在侯赛尼谈话后的第三天，美国国务院却宣布，美国政府认为目前参加修建埃及阿斯旺水坝工程不是实际可行的，因此拒绝了埃及的建议。
    这件事情是很能说明美国对落后国家的援助意味着什么的。阿斯旺水坝是发展埃及国民经济的一项极重要的建设工程。美国在去年十二月向埃及建议，愿意协助修建水坝工程，并且愿意提供第一阶段工程所需的资金五千六百万美元。同时美国竭力宣传经济落后国家接受苏联援助的所谓“危险性”。用“纽约先驱论坛报”的话来说，美国这样做是为了“使苏联不能参加一项每一个埃及人所梦寐以求的工程”。
    拆穿来说，美国是想利用这笔“援助”来使埃及落进它的圈套，控制埃及的经济命脉，迫使埃及改变它现在所奉行的和平独立的政策，以便最后把埃及变成美国的殖民地。美国控制的国际复兴开发银行曾经表示愿意给埃及两亿美元的贷款来修建水坝，条件是要埃及政府允许它成立某种“监督机构”来监督埃及的经济政策，这就充分说明了美国的阴谋。
    但是，埃及人民的骨头是硬的。他们不愿意用自己的自由来换取美国的金钱。埃及的“人民报”曾经说，“埃及将拒绝任何美国援助，如果它要求埃及为这种援助付出那怕是极少的一点自由。”尽管有美国的利诱、威胁和恫吓，埃及始终坚定地执行着和平独立的政策，积极发展同苏联、中国和人民民主国家以及其他爱好和平国家的关系，在国际事务中发挥越来越重要的影响和作用，这一切都使美国感到十分不安。特别是埃及今年五月正式承认中国，同中国建立了外交关系，激起了美国统治集团的疯狂的忿怒。美国国会议员和报纸对埃及奉行独立政策，进行了恶毒的攻击。美国对于用美元来收买埃及的独立感到绝望了。
    利诱不成，就继之以威胁。这时候，美国政客们立刻忘记了他们说过的愿意帮助落后国家发展经济的一切甜言蜜语，露出了一付凶相。对阿斯旺水坝工程的援助被取消了。美联社从纽约发出的消息用充满恫吓的腔调说，美国这个行动是“西方各国改变对阿拉伯国家的政策的先声，这将对纳赛尔的领导发生重大影响”。换句话说，美国的目的是要对埃及施加强大的压力，给埃及政府制造困难，来迫使埃及改变政策。可以预料，美国将采取比这更狠毒的手段来对埃及人民和政府实行进攻。
    但是，美国统治集团忘记了，落后国家现在有了真正的朋友，它们可以不用丧失一点点独立和自由，从这些朋友手里取得真诚无私的援助。美国可以用“援助”来左右落后国家的日子早已过去了。埃及人民是“贫贱不能移，威武不能屈”的人民，他们是不会被美国的威胁所吓倒的。只要他们保持警惕，坚持独立，美国的任何阴谋都将遭到可耻的失败。埃及人民建设自己国家的美好愿望是必然要实现的。他们将要亲手在尼罗河上建筑起阿斯旺水坝，到那时候，我们再来看看现在那些对埃及人民张牙舞爪的人在哪里吧。
