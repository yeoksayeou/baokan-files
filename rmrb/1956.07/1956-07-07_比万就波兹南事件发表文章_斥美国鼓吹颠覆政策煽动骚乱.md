Xinhua News Agency, London, 6th: Prominent British Labour Party Member of Parliament, Bevan, said on the 5th that if the United States believes now is a good time to plot conspiracies and create domestic unrest among communist workers, it is "once again trying to turn back the clock."

In an article commenting on the Poznan incident published in the "Tribune" weekly, Bevan severely criticized the "liberation" policy frequently advocated by the likes of Dulles. He said that no matter what the word "liberation" means in the minds of some, it should certainly not be conceived as an act of war, namely "starting with inciting internal discontent, then stirring up domestic unrest, which will then develop into a civil war, and finally develop into intervention by the relevant foreign countries."

Bevan also said: "Liberation" was once a noble concept and inspired many heroic acts, but now the word has "an unpleasant sound." "The word becomes bad when it comes from the mouths of those who remain silent on Cyprus and Guatemala, and who say nothing about the concentration camps in Kenya."

"The word is inconsistent with the practice of treating Spain and Portugal as allies."

Bevan believes that the "liberation" policy of foreign intervention must be opposed, because it may cause a third world war.

Bevan continued, if the accusations that foreign agencies were behind the Poznan incident are true, then "doing so is reckless and cruel." The occurrence of the Poznan incident is regrettable. "If the United States believes that the changes taking place in communist countries and the ensuing debates are opportunities to plot conspiracies and create domestic unrest among communist workers, then they are once again trying to turn back the clock."

    比万就波兹南事件发表文章
    斥美国鼓吹颠覆政策煽动骚乱
    新华社6日讯　伦敦消息：著名的英国工党议员比万五日说，如果美国认为现在是在共产党工人间布置阴谋并且制造国内骚乱的好机会，那它是“又一次想把时钟倒拨”。
    比万在“论坛”周报发表的一篇评论波兹南事件的文章里严厉批评杜勒斯之流经常鼓吹的“解放”政策。他说，不管“解放”这个字眼在某些人的头脑中意味着什么，肯定不应当把它想成是战争行动，即“从煽动内部不满开始，然后激起国内骚乱，到时候就发展成内战，最后发展到由有关的外国进行干涉”。
    比万还说：“解放”这个字眼一度曾经是一种高尚的概念，并且鼓舞过许多英勇行为，但是现在这个字眼听起来已经有“一种不良的声音”。“出诸那些对塞浦路斯和危地马拉保持沉默、对怯尼亚的集中营等事件一言不发的人之口，这个字眼就变得不好了”。
    “这个字眼同把西班牙和葡萄牙当作盟国的做法是不相称的。”
    比万认为必须反对外国干涉的“解放”政策。因为这可能会引起第三次世界大战。
    比万继续说，如果关于波兹南事件幕后有外国机关在活动的指责是真实的话，那么“这样做是轻举妄动的和残忍的”。波兹南事件的发生是可悲的。“如果美国认为现在共产党国家所发生的变化和随之而来的争论是在共产党工人间布置阴谋并制造国内骚乱的机会，这样他们又一次想把时钟倒拨。”
