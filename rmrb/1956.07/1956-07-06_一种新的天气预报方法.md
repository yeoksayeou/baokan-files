A New Method of Weather Forecasting
Gu Zhenchao, Researcher at the Institute of Geophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences

Weather forecasting or meteorological forecasting is closely related to national economic activities and people's daily lives. Since liberation, China's meteorological work has seen new development, the accuracy of short-term weather forecasts has been greatly improved, and medium-term weather forecasts have also begun to be supplied. However, this is far from meeting the needs of the development of construction undertakings. On the one hand, we do not yet have specialized forecasts suitable for the needs of various national economic sectors, and on the other hand, the accuracy of our weather forecasts is not high enough, especially disaster weather forecasts are not very accurate.

What is the reason for this situation? Is it that our forecasters' technical level is not high enough or that they are not responsible enough? It should be admitted that our forecasters do not have enough experience and their theoretical level needs to be greatly improved, and some forecasters are sometimes not responsible enough, which has even caused some responsibility accidents. However, our forecasters basically master the international general weather forecasting technology, and under the education of the Party, the vast majority of them are also very responsible. Although they shoulder heavy and difficult tasks, they still work happily.

In this way, the issue of weather forecasting accuracy mainly cannot but be studied from the perspective of weather forecasting methods.

Indeed, weather forecasting technology in meteorology is much worse than forecasting in other disciplines. Whether it is tide forecasting in oceanography or the forecasting of planetary movements and solar and lunar eclipses in astronomy, they can be calculated day by day and time by time a year in advance, and compiled into annual tide tables and astronomical almanacs. Although it also has slight errors, the accuracy can meet the needs. The situation of weather forecasting is different. The current weather forecasting technology in the world can not only absolutely not predict the daily weather conditions for the next year, but also cannot predict disaster weather for twenty-four hours.

The problem is two-fold. On the one hand, the actual weather change information that humans have mastered is really too little. The atmosphere is deep and vast, and the materials we have mastered are mainly limited to the ground. In vast areas such as deserts, oceans, plateaus, and ice sheets, even the ground conditions have not been fully grasped. In this way, the forecast will not be accurate. On the other hand, the physical processes of weather changes are very complex, and people can only rely on experience and some qualitative theoretical rules to analyze these materials and make judgments. Therefore, what they get can only be semi-empirical and qualitative weather forecasts, which are therefore prone to large errors.

Is there a way to improve weather forecasting technology and accurately calculate objective and quantitative weather forecasts using equations that describe atmospheric physical processes? Yes, people have long had this ideal, which is the rapidly developing numerical weather prediction in recent years.

Modern numerical weather prediction is first and foremost inseparable from the large increase in daily observations of high-altitude weather in the past one or two decades. This has enabled humans to have a better understanding of the atmosphere. The layer where weather changes the most is what we call the troposphere. About fifteen years ago, meteorologists noticed that although the thickness of this layer of air is more than ten kilometers, it is obviously much smaller compared with the horizontal range of large-scale airflows, that is, the air movement is almost gentle. Starting from this point, meteorologists have grasped some important laws of large-scale movements. It is not difficult to understand that these large-scale air movements and weather changes are much simpler than usual. Therefore, the weather equation set describing large-scale air movements and weather changes is relatively simple. However, it still takes a lot of time to calculate weather and forecast weather using this relatively simple weather equation set. Because for a twenty-four-hour large-scale weather situation forecast (that is, the general situation of airflow distribution, from which we can further forecast actual weather phenomena such as precipitation and temperature), we need to do millions of addition and subtraction calculations and millions of multiplication and division calculations when solving the equation. If one person does it manually, it may not even be completed in a lifetime. Therefore, we need to use the help of modern fast electronic computers here. With the help of fast electronic computers, a twenty-four-hour forecast of the large-scale weather situation in a region like East Asia can be calculated in one or two hours.

Up to now, generally speaking, the problem of large-scale weather situation forecasts for a period of one or two days has been largely solved. Experiments and applications in the past two or three years have proved that the numerical weather forecasting results of this method are no worse than those of the best forecasters. And some dangerous weather's strong development, the forecasters' forecast errors, can be calculated and predicted by the numerical forecasting method.

Because numerical weather prediction has had practical value, countries such as Sweden and the United States have begun to produce daily numerical weather forecasts using specialized fast electronic computers since the beginning of 1955. The Soviet Union has also developed a fast electronic computer specifically for numerical prediction to conduct numerical weather prediction research. If everyone had doubts two or three years ago, then the achievements of numerical prediction in the past two or three years have gradually been recognized.

Using the numerical weather prediction method can not only calculate quantitative forecasts, but also easily check and improve this forecast. This is because the numerical weather forecast is actually calculated under certain theoretical foundations and assumptions. It can be quantitatively compared with the actual weather changes. If it is found that the forecast is not very consistent with the actual situation, the calculation method can be changed to check what factors we have not considered, which led to this forecast error. In this way, we can adopt new and more suitable methods to make numerical forecasts. General forecasts are made through rough estimates based on experience and qualitative theoretical rules. Therefore, it is often impossible to accurately determine whether the estimate is incorrect, or whether the rule is used incorrectly, or whether the experience or rule itself is wrong, and the inspection and improvement of the forecast is more difficult. It can be seen from this that the numerical weather prediction method is a reliable way to develop weather prediction in the direction of precision.

Through the objective and strict verification of numerical weather prediction, we can also find out the main factors of the atmospheric dynamic process, understand the characteristics of the atmospheric dynamic process, and enrich and promote the development of atmospheric dynamics theory and weather prediction theory. Therefore, in academic terms, it is also a growth point.

Therefore, in recent years, the world has paid great attention to the research on numerical prediction. In addition to the forecast of weather situations, the forecast of specific weather phenomena, such as the problem of large-scale precipitation forecasting, is also under study. Preliminary experimental results prove that this numerical precipitation forecast is very promising. Japanese meteorological workers have also studied the numerical forecast of typhoon movement and obtained some preliminary results. In short, numerical weather prediction is developing rapidly.

Recently, the work of numerical weather prediction has also developed in the direction of long-term weather forecasting. It can be expected that in the next twelve years, there will be considerable progress in this area, so that a part of the long-term weather forecast of more than three days can be accurately made using numerical prediction methods.

From the above introduction, it can be understood that in order to improve the accuracy of weather forecasts and help our socialist construction, we should quickly establish and develop the work of numerical weather prediction.

To carry out numerical weather prediction work, we first need to gather a group of people to work together from all aspects. This is not only because numerical weather prediction work involves weather forecasting and atmospheric dynamics theory, but also involves the installation of fast electronic computers and many parts of computational mathematics and differential equations, and also because for our country, due to the special terrain conditions and relatively low latitude, many specific atmospheric physical processes need to be studied and tested by everyone before they can be clarified and a suitable numerical prediction method can be established. For example, the average height of the Tibetan Plateau is four or five kilometers, and the impact on the weather must be specifically considered in the numerical forecast. Also, in our summer, rainstorms are very strong and the rain belt is narrow, which cannot be directly solved by the existing numerical precipitation forecasting methods.

It should also be noted that our station network is still not perfect, especially the radio wind measurement network should be established quickly. For China's latitude and terrain conditions, without detailed high-altitude wind observation data, numerical prediction is difficult to be satisfactory. Of course, we also need more and better high-altitude temperature, humidity and other observations. From the perspective of long-term requirements, the atmospheric radiation observation network also needs to be established in a timely manner.

In terms of technology, the most important measure is the installation of fast electronic computers. The calculation work in numerical weather prediction is very huge. Without the help of this computer, numerical prediction cannot be well developed.

There is no doubt that numerical weather prediction is an extremely meaningful work. Through planned long-term scientific research, this work will be rapidly and fully developed in our country to meet the growing needs of socialist economic construction and people's daily lives for weather forecasts.

    一种新的天气预报方法
    中国科学院地球物理研究所研究员　顾震潮
    天气预报或气象预报对国民经济活动和人民的日常生活有密切的关系。解放以后，我国的气象工作有了新的开展，短期天气预报的准确率已经提高了不少，中期天气预报也已经开始了供应。但是这远不能满足建设事业发展的需要。这一方面是我们还没有适合各个国民经济部门需要的专业性的预报，另一方面，我们的天气预报准确率还不够高，特别是灾害性的天气预报还不能十分准确。
    这种状况是什么原因造成的呢，是不是我们的预报员技术水平不够高、不够负责呢？应该承认，我们的预报员经验还不够丰富，理论水平还需要大大提高，个别预报员有时候责任心不强，以致还造成一些责任性事故。然而，我们的预报员基本上是掌握了国际上一般的天气预报技术的，他们在党的教育下，绝大多数也是十分负责的，他们虽然担负着沉重而困难的任务，可是还是愉快地工作着。
    这样，天气预报准确率的问题，主要地就不能不从天气预报的方法上来研究了。
    的确，气象学里的天气预报技术，比起别的学科里的预报来是差得多了。不论是海洋学里的潮汐预报或是天文学里的行星行动和日蚀月蚀的预报，都可以早在一年以前逐日逐次地推算出来，编成整年的潮汐表和天文年历。它虽然也有微小的误差，但是准确度是能够满足需要的。天气预报的情形就不同了。目前世界上的气象预报的技术不仅绝对报不出下一年逐日的天气情况，就是二十四小时的灾害性天气预报也还有报不出的。
    问题是两方面的。一方面是人类所掌握的天气变化的实际情况实在太少。大气是深厚宽广的，而我们所掌握的材料主要还局限于地面，在沙漠、海洋、高原、冰原等等广大地区，连地面情况也不曾充分掌握。这样，预报也就不会准确。另一方面，天气变化的物理过程十分复杂，而人们只能依靠经验和一些定性的理论规则来分析这些材料，作出判断，因此得出的也只能是半经验的、定性的，因而是误差比较大的天气预报。
    是不是有办法把天气预报的技术提高，用描写大气物理过程的方程式精确地算出客观的定量的天气预报来呢？是的，人们也早有这种理想，它就是近年来飞速发展着的天气数值预报。
    近代的天气数值预报首先是和近一二十年来高空天气日常观测的大量增加分不开的。这样就使人类对大气的情况有了比较多的了解。天气变化最大的层次，就是我们所称的对流层。约在十五年前，气象学者注意到这层空气的厚度虽然有十几公里，但是和大范围的气流的水平活动范围比较起来，却显然小得很多，即空气运动几乎是平缓的。从这点开始，气象学者掌握了大范围运动的一些重要规律。不难了解，这样的大范围空气运动和天气变化比一般的情况就简单多了。因而描写大范围空气运动和天气变化的天气方程组就比较简单。然而，要用这比较简单的天气方程组来计算天气、预报天气，那还是很费时间的。因为对于一个二十四小时的大范围天气形势（就是气流分布的一般情况，由此再进一步就可以预报降水、温度等实际天气现象）的预报，我们解方程式的时候就要做几百万个加减计算和几百万个乘除计算，如果由一个人来手算，那末甚至一辈子也计算不完。因此，这里又要用上现代快速电子计算机的帮助。有了快速电子计算机的帮助，像东亚这样一个区域的大范围天气形势的二十四小时预报就可以在一、二小时内算出来。
    到现在为止，一般说来，为期一二天的大范围天气形势预报，问题很大一部分已经解决。最近二三年来的试验和应用证明，这种方法的天气数值预报成绩已经不比最好的预报员来得差。而有一些危险天气的强烈发展，预报员的预报错误，用数值预报方法却可以计算出来，预报出来。
    由于天气的数值预报已经有了实用价值，所以瑞典、美国等国家从1955年初起已经先后用专门的快速电子计算机开始制作日常的天气数值预报。苏联也已经制成了专门为数值预报用的快速电子计算机进行天气数值预报的研究。如果说在二三年以前大家还有怀疑的话，那末这二三年来数值预报的成就已经渐渐得到公认了。
    用天气的数值预报方法不但可以算出定量的预报，并且也容易检查、改进这种预报。这是因为天气的数值预报是在一定理论基础和假定下实际计算出来的，它可以定量地和天气变化实况来对证。如果发现预报同实况不大一致的时候，可以改变计算方法，来检查一下究竟有些什么因素我们没有考虑到，以致这次预报错误。这样我们就可以采取新的更合适的方法来作数值预报。一般的预报是凭经验和定性的理论规则经过粗略的估计作出来的，因此往往不能确切肯定究竟还是估计得不对，还是规则使用错了，还是经验或规则本身错了，而预报的检查、改进就比较困难。由此可见，天气的数值预报方法是使天气预报向精确化方向发展的可靠办法。
    通过天气数值预报的客观的严格对证，还可以找出大气动力过程的主要因子，了解大气动力过程的特性而丰富并且推动大气动力学理论和天气预报理论的发展。因此，在学术上它也是一个生长点。
    所以，近年来世界上对数值预报的研究是十分注意的。除了天气形势的预报以外，具体天气现象的预报，例如大范围降水预报的问题也在研究之中，初步的试验结果证明这种降水数值预报是很有希望的。日本的气象工作者并且研究了台风移动的数值预报，得到一些初步结果。总之，天气的数值预报正迅速地发展着。
    最近，天气数值预报的工作还向着长期天气预报的方向发展。可以预计，在未来的十二年中，这方面会有不少进展，以使三天以上的一部分长期天气预报可以精确地用数值预报的方法来作。
    从上面的介绍可以了解，为了提高天气预报准确率，帮助我们的社会主义建设，我们应该迅速建立和发展天气数值预报的工作。
    开展天气数值预报工作，首先需要集中一批人力，由各方面配合来作。这不但因为天气数值预报的工作牵涉到天气预报，牵涉到大气动力学理论，也牵涉到快速电子计算机的装设和计算数学以及微分方程上的许多部分，并且还因为对于我国来说，由于地形条件的特殊，纬度比较低，许多具体的大气物理过程还要通过大家研究、试验才能弄清楚，才能建立合适的数值预报方法。例如西藏大高原平均高到四、五公里，数值预报中就不能不具体考虑到它对天气的影响。又如我们的夏季，暴雨非常强烈而雨带较窄，不是现有的降水数值预报方法可以直接解决的。
    也应该注意我们的台站网还是不够完善的，特别是无线电测风网应该迅速建立起来。对我国的纬度和地形情况来说，没有详细的高空风观测资料，数值预报是难于作得满意的。当然我们也需要更多、更好的高空温度、湿度等观测。从长时间的要求来看，大气辐射的观测网也需要及时建立起来。
    在技术方面，最主要的措施还是快速电子计算机的装设。天气数值预报中的计算工作十分巨大，没有这种计算机的帮助，数值预报是不能很好开展的。
    毫无疑问，天气数值预报是一件极有意义的工作。通过有计划的长期科学研究，这项工作将在我国得到迅速、充分的发展，以满足社会主义经济建设和人民日常生活对天气预报的日益增长的需要。
