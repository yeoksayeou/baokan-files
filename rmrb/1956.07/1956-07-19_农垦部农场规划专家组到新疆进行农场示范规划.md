    Ministry of Agricultural Reclamation Farm Planning Expert Group Goes to Xinjiang for Farm Demonstration Planning
    (Our newspaper's Urumqi dispatch, July 15) The Ministry of Agricultural Reclamation recently organized a farm planning expert group to go to Xinjiang to assist the Production and Construction Corps in farm demonstration planning. On July 13th and 14th, this working group and the Production and Construction Corps working group departed from Urumqi for the Boguxi Lake area west of Korla. They will soon begin comprehensive work. The main purpose of this planning for Boguxi Lake is to summarize the experience of solving the difficulties and problems existing in the current farm planning work. The Boguxi Lake area is widely representative in terms of soil quality, hydrology, and topography: high salinity-alkalinity, complex terrain, many fields interspersed with residents, and high water levels. The experience gained from this farm planning work will guide farm planning work in Xinjiang and other regions. The farm planning expert group includes three Soviet experts who have previously been involved in the planning and design of the State-owned Friendship Farm: land planning experts Maslov (who has not yet arrived in Xinjiang), Beteri, and water conservancy expert Rizezov, as well as land planning technical cadres and university students from the Ministry of Agricultural Reclamation. Gansu, Qinghai and other provinces have also sent cadres to participate in this planning work. It is expected that the planning work for Boguxi Lake will be completed within two months.

    农垦部农场规划专家组到新疆进行农场示范规划
    本报乌鲁木齐15日电　农垦部最近组织了一个农场规划专家组到新疆帮助生产建设兵团进行农场示范规划。七月十三日、十四日，这个工作组和生产建设兵团工作组已先后从乌鲁木齐出发到库尔勒以西的博古西湖地区，不日将全面开展工作。这次规划博古西湖的主要目的，是总结解决目前农场规划工作中存在的困难问题的经验。博古西湖地区在土质、水文、地形等方面，都具有广泛的代表性：盐碱大、地形复杂、掺杂居民的田地多、水位高等。通过这个农场规划工作的经验，指导新疆和其他地区的农场规划工作。农场规划专家组中，有曾经担任过国营友谊农场规划设计的土地规划专家马斯洛夫（还未到新疆）、别捷里和水利专家日则佐夫三位苏联专家，还有农垦部土地规划技术干部和实习的大学生。甘肃、青海等省，也分别派来干部参加这次规划工作。预计在两个月内可完成博古西湖的规划工作。
