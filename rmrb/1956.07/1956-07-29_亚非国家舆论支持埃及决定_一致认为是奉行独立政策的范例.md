Xinhua News Agency, July 28th: Khartoum News: Sudanese political leaders unanimously expressed their support for Egypt's nationalization of the Suez Canal on July 27th.

Prime Minister Khalil said he hoped Egypt's action would be successful.

Former Prime Minister Azhari believed it was one of the "best actions" of the Egyptian "revolutionary government." He expressed the hope that Egypt and Sudan could resolve the issue of using Nile water for the mutual benefit and happiness of both countries.

Xinhua News Agency, July 28th: Damascus News: Syrian party leaders telegraphed the Egyptian President on the 27th to congratulate him on Egypt's decision to nationalize the Suez Canal. Groups of people held demonstrations in the streets of Damascus, chanting slogans in support of Egypt's action.

All newspapers hailed Egypt's counterattack against the pressure exerted by the United States and Britain on Egypt regarding the Aswan Dam issue. Some newspapers published the news under the headline "Nasser Slaps the West in the Face."

Xinhua News Agency, July 28th: Beirut News: The entire nation of Lebanon unanimously supports the Egyptian President's decision to nationalize the Suez Canal. All newspapers in Beirut published the news on the 27th with large three-inch headlines.

Lebanese Prime Minister Yafi told reporters: "The nationalization of the Suez Canal is an action within the scope of Egyptian sovereignty and should not be opposed."

Speaker of Parliament Oseiran said: Egypt's takeover of the International Suez Canal Company is "a major event that other Arab countries can follow when necessary."

Xinhua News Agency, July 27th: Amman News: Thousands of Amman citizens marched and demonstrated in the streets today, enthusiastically expressing their support for Egypt's nationalization of the Suez Canal.

Indian and Indonesian Newspapers Believe Egypt's Action is Very Satisfying
Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, July 28th: The "Indian Express" commented on Egypt's nationalization of the Suez Canal, saying: "Undoubtedly, this blow against the last remnant of foreign control on Egyptian territory will be popular," and the "economic arguments put forward" by the Egyptian President are also "reasonable."

"The Hindu" said today: "The Suez Canal is indeed a very important international waterway, but the fact remains that it runs through Egyptian territory, and the issue of internationalizing waterways has not been resolved elsewhere. Therefore, it would be unwise for Britain or the United States to treat the nationalization of the International Suez Canal Company as an act of hostility."

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, July 28th: Egypt's action to nationalize the Suez Canal has received unanimous praise from newspapers of all persuasions here today.

"Merdeka" (Independence Daily) said that Egypt's action was a courageous and decisive act. Abdul Nasser has proved himself to the Egyptian people as a capable leader who can safeguard the dignity of his country. This decision is in the interests of his people and country.

"Rakjat" (People's Daily) said that Egypt's action is another step towards complete national independence. The newspaper also said that this is a brave patriotic action. Indonesia should follow Egypt's firm and courageous attitude in the struggle against colonialism when striving to abolish the Round Table Conference agreement.

Xinhua News Agency, Karachi, July 28th: Karachi politicians praised Egypt's nationalization of the Suez Canal and demanded that the Pakistani government stand with Egypt.

The Pakistani government should now stand with the Egyptian people, support their cause, and thereby show the world that it truly supports the people of the Middle East."

    据新华社28日讯　大马士革消息：叙利亚的政党领袖们二十七日打电报给埃及总统祝贺埃及把苏彝士运河收归国有的决定。大马士革街道上一群群的人举行示威，高呼口号支持埃及的这一行动。
    各报都欢呼埃及对美国和英国在阿斯旺水坝问题上对埃及施加压力的反击。有的报纸在“纳赛尔给了西方一巴掌”的标题下刊登了这个消息。
    据新华社28日讯　贝鲁特消息：黎巴嫩全国上下一致支持埃及总统把苏彝士运河收归国有的决定。贝鲁特各报在二十七日都以三英寸高的大标题刊登了这个消息。

      “印度教徒报”今天说：“苏彝士运河的确是很重要的国际水道，但是，事实仍然是：它是流经埃及领土的，而水道国际化的问题在别的地方也没有解决过。因此，英国或美国如果把国际苏彝士运河公司被收归国有当作敌对行动来对待的话，那是不明智的。”
