Promote Mass Wisdom to Improve Agricultural Production
Yuanjiang Rural Areas Launch Rationalization Proposal Campaign

    This newspaper reports that a large-scale rationalization proposal campaign is underway in the rural areas of Yuanjiang County, Hunan Province. According to incomplete statistics, from March to May, farmers in various cooperatives throughout the county have already put forward more than 1,100 rationalization proposals and 164 inventions (20 of which have been successful). Most of these rationalization proposals and inventions have been adopted by local agricultural cooperatives, and some have been promoted throughout the county, playing a significant role in promoting agricultural production. Among the more prominent examples, Liu Mingfeng, the production team leader of the "Qianlijuma" Agricultural Cooperative, invented a double-shared wooden plow that allows one person and one ox to plow eight to ten mu of paddy fields per day, doubling the efficiency compared to the old-fashioned plow. At that time, the county was short of 90,000 cattle workdays; after the promotion of 1,700 double-shared wooden plows, the shortage of cattle was effectively resolved, and 20,000 labor days were saved, ensuring timely rice transplanting. After the promotion of the low-temperature germination method using bamboo mats and the clear water seedling rinsing method created by Cai Yide, a member of the Dongtingchun Agricultural Cooperative, the healthy growth of seedlings throughout the county was ensured. After transplanting, the advanced experience of applying "An Dou Hui" (a type of top dressing for paddy fields) was widely promoted throughout the county, and the fertilizer shortage problem has been basically resolved. Yang Xixian's invented fertilizer applicator can fertilize five and a half mu per day (three times more efficient than direct hand application), which played a significant role in ensuring the timely application of "An Dou Hui". Currently, many people are continuing to research new agricultural tools such as rice transplanters, hemp peeling machines, new-style waterwheels, cultivators, and foot-operated reed rollers, striving to quickly use them to improve production.

    In the early stages of launching this campaign, Yuanjiang County established an organizational structure to lead the campaign. Rationalization proposal committees were established at the county, district, township, and cooperative levels. The county has full-time staff with a certain level of scientific and technical expertise, responsible for identifying and promoting various rationalization proposals and inventions. In addition, rationalization proposal reward regulations were formulated and distributed to each agricultural cooperative for discussion. These measures played a significant role in promoting the rationalization proposal campaign.

    发扬群众智慧改进农业生产
    沅江农村展开了合理化建议运动
    本报讯　湖南沅江县农村中正在开展着一个规模巨大的合理化建议运动。据不完全统计：从三月到五月，全县各个合作社的农民已经提出了一千一百多条合理化建议和164件创造发明（其中二十件已经成功）。这些合理化建议和创造发明，大部分已经被当地农业社采用，有的已在全县推广，对推动全县农业生产起了很大作用。其中较突出的有“千里驹”农业社生产队长刘明凤创造的双铧木犁，一人一牛每天能犁水田八亩到十亩，比旧式犁提高工效一倍。当时全县缺少九万个牛工；推广了一千七百张双铧木犁以后，有效地解决了缺牛的困难，而且节省了两万个人工，保证按时插好了秧。洞庭春农业社社员蔡一德创造的晒簟低温催芽法和清水漂秧法推广以后，保证了全县秧苗生长良好。插秧以后，全县普遍推广施“安蔸灰”（稻田追肥的一种）的先进经验，缺肥问题也已经基本解决。阳希贤创造的点肥机，一天能点五亩半（比直接用手施肥提高工效三倍），对保证及时点“安蔸灰”起了很大作用。现在，还有不少人正在继续研究插秧机、剥麻机、新式水车、中耕器、脚踏蒲滚等新农具，争取很快地用来改进生产。
    沅江县在发动这个运动的初期，就建立了一套领导这个运动的组织机构。县、区、乡、社逐级成立了合理化建议委员会；县里设有具备一定科学技术水平的专职工作人员，负责鉴定和推广各种合理化建议和创造发明。此外，还制定了合理化建议奖励条例，发给各农业社讨论。这些措施，对推进合理化建议运动起了很大的作用。
