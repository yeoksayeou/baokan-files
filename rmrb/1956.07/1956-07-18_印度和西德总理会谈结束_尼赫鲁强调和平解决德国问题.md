Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, July 17th. Bonn dispatch: The talks between Indian Prime Minister Nehru and West German Chancellor Adenauer, which began in Bonn on July 13th, have concluded. During the three days of talks, the two sides discussed several issues in the international situation, and Nehru particularly explained India's views on the situation to Adenauer.

The joint communique issued by both sides on July 16th stated that they unanimously agreed that "respect for national independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity, and non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries are the basis for friendly and peaceful cooperation between all countries."

During the talks, the German question occupied a special position. As can be seen from Western news agency reports, Adenauer attempted to seek some support from India on this issue. However, the communique issued after the talks only stated: "The Indian Prime Minister expressed sympathy and understanding for the German people's desire to peacefully restore the unity of their country." The Associated Press, in reporting the results of the talks, pointed out that Nehru "did not endorse" Adenauer's "policy of militarily aligning West Germany with the Western alliance as a means of achieving unification" and his attitude that "only the Bonn government can represent all the German people."

During his short stay in Bonn, Nehru repeatedly emphasized in his speeches and at press conferences that peaceful methods and negotiations must be adopted to resolve the German question. Nehru also stated at a press conference on July 14th that India refused to undertake any obligation in Bonn regarding the issue of whether it should recognize the German Democratic Republic. When discussing this issue, Nehru stated that "it is impossible to predict what (the Indian) government will do in the future and bind the government." Nehru also denied Western rumors that he would accept Adenauer's commission to "mediate" between the United States and the Soviet Union on the issue of German reunification.

The talks also discussed the issue of West Germany providing technical assistance for India's economic construction. According to the joint communique, West Germany is prepared to provide technical knowledge to develop India's economic plans. The two governments will cooperate to establish a technical research institute in India, with West Germany providing teachers and equipment. West Germany will also accept Indian students to study at West German technical schools.

    印度和西德总理会谈结束
    尼赫鲁强调和平解决德国问题
    据新华社柏林17日电　波恩消息：印度总理尼赫鲁和西德总理阿登纳从七月十三日起在波恩开始的会谈已经结束。在这次前后三天的会谈中，双方讨论了国际局势中的一些问题，尼赫鲁特别向阿登纳解释了印度对局势的看法。
    双方在七月十六日发表的联合公报中声明，他们一致同意“尊重民族独立、主权和领土完整以及不干涉别国内政是所有国家之间进行友好的和平的合作的基础”。
    在这次会谈中，德国问题占着特殊的地位。从西方通讯社的消息中可以看出，阿登纳企图在这个问题上寻求印度的某种支持。但是会谈后发表的公报只是说：“印度总理对于德国人民希望和平地恢复他们国家的统一的愿望表示同情和了解。”美联社在报道这次会谈的结果时指出，对于阿登纳的“使西德在军事上以同西方联盟作为实现统一的方法的政策”和“只有波恩政府才能代表全体德国人民”的态度，尼赫鲁“并没有给予赞同”。
    在他停留在波恩的短短几天中，尼赫鲁在历次发表的演说里和在记者招待会上，一再强调必须采取和平的方法，通过和平谈判来解决德国问题。尼赫鲁并且在七月十四日举行的记者招待会上表明，印度在波恩希望它不要承认德意志民主共和国的问题上拒绝承担义务。尼赫鲁在谈到这个问题的时候表示“不可能预言（印度）政府在将来要作些什么而使政府受到束缚”。尼赫鲁同时也否认了西方所传说的他将要接受阿登纳的委托就德国统一问题在美国和苏联之间进行“调解”的说法。
    在这次会谈中，还讨论了西德在印度的经济建设中给以技术援助的问题。据联合公报说，西德准备提供技术知识以发展印度的经济的计划。两国政府将协力在印度设立一所技术研究学院，由西德提供教员和设备。西德还将接受印度学生去西德技术学校学习。
