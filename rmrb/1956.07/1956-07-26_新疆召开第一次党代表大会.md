Urumqi, July 24th (By this newspaper) – The First Congress of the Communist Party of China in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region was held in Urumqi from July 9th to 24th. The 561 delegates attending the congress, comprising twelve ethnic groups, represented more than 68,000 party members.

All delegates unanimously agreed that the Lanzhou-Urumqi-Aktogay railway will soon be open to traffic, and Xinjiang is on the eve of large-scale industrial construction. Therefore, the basic tasks of the Party committees at all levels and all Party members in the autonomous region in the future are: to complete socialist transformation, consolidate and develop socialist relations of production, concentrate major efforts to carry out socialist construction in a planned way, develop industrial, agricultural, and animal husbandry production, further improve the material and cultural life of all ethnic groups, consolidate the unity and friendly relations among all ethnic groups, and enable all ethnic groups in the autonomous region to transition to a socialist society together with the people of the whole country.

The delegates discussed the work report made by Wang Enmao, First Secretary of the CPC Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region Committee. It was believed that the Party's arduous work in Xinjiang over the past six years has brought about fundamental changes in the region. By 1957, the social democratic reform will be basically completed. On October 1, 1955, the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region was proclaimed, and the work of ethnic regional autonomy was completed. Over the past six years, a large number of cadres have been trained and promoted. Among the existing 92,000 cadres, local ethnic minority cadres account for more than 51,000; more than 34,000 new Party members have been developed, of which more than 27,000 are local ethnic minority Party members.

In group meetings and plenary speeches, the delegates seriously criticized the shortcomings in various tasks. They pointed out that the system of collective leadership of the Party committee is not sound enough, criticism and self-criticism are not carried out sufficiently, and many Party members still have Han chauvinism or local nationalism and bourgeois individualism. In the work of the united front, there is still a relatively widespread tendency of closed-doorism. In the cause of socialist transformation, after correcting the right-leaning conservative thinking, there have been phenomena of impatience and rashness in some aspects. The development of industrial construction and agricultural and animal husbandry production is not in harmony. Some factories and mines that should and could be built have been built less, and some factories and mines that should have been built earlier have been built late. The estimation of the increase in social purchasing power and the people's demand for commodity supply is insufficient, and the phenomenon of out-of-stock or backlog of commodities occurs continuously. The reasons for these shortcomings and errors are mainly that the understanding of the central government and Comrade Mao Zedong's policies and instructions on minority areas is not sufficient, the estimation of the development trend of socialism and the socialist enthusiasm of the people of all ethnic groups is insufficient, and there is a lack of timely and in-depth understanding of the situation in the Xinjiang region. The congress also made a resolution requiring overcoming the above shortcomings, mobilizing all forces inside and outside the Party in Xinjiang to realize the Party's general line in the transition period and the Party's general task in ethnic issues, and completing the historical task of socialist transformation and socialist construction. The resolution requires that in the future, the implementation of ethnic policies must be checked in a planned, regular, systematic, and in-depth manner, and all behaviors that violate ethnic policies must be resolutely prevented and corrected, and ethnic policies, theories, and languages must be earnestly studied. The resolution emphasizes that in the future, the collective leadership of the Party committee must be strengthened, the meeting system of the Party committee must be effectively improved, problems must be discussed in a planned and prepared manner, especially problems related to principles and policies, the implementation of leadership and resolutions must be checked regularly, and criticism and self-criticism must be carried out. Leading cadres should go deep into the grassroots and among the masses.

The congress elected the new members of the CPC Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region Committee and the delegates to the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China.

    新疆召开第一次党代表大会
    本报乌鲁木齐24日电　中共新疆维吾尔自治区第一次代表大会，从七月九日到二十四日在乌鲁木齐举行。出席大会的561名代表，包括十二个民族成分，代表六万八千多名党员。
    全体代表一致认为，兰州—乌鲁木齐—阿克斗卡铁路不久就要通车，新疆正处在大规模工业建设的前夜。因而自治区各级党委和全体党员今后的基本任务是：完成社会主义改造，巩固和发展社会主义生产关系，集中主要力量有计划地进行社会主义建设，发展工、农、牧业生产，进一步改善各族人民的物质和文化生活，巩固各民族团结友爱关系，使自治区各民族和全国人民一道共同过渡到社会主义社会。
    代表们讨论了中共新疆维吾尔自治区委员会第一书记王恩茂所作的工作报告。认为党在新疆六年多来的艰巨工作，使这一地区的面貌起了根本的变化。到1957年，将基本上完成社会民主改革。1955年10月1日，新疆维吾尔自治区宣告成立，完成了民族区域自治工作。六年多来，培养和提拔了大批干部，在现有九万二千名干部中，本地民族干部占五万一千多名；发展了三万四千多名新党员，其中本地民族党员二万七千多名。
    在小组会和大会发言中，代表们严肃地批评了各项工作中的缺点。他们指出党委集体领导制度还不够健全，批评和自我批评开展得不够，不少党员还有大民族主义思想或地方民族主义思想和资产阶级的个人主义思想。在统一战线工作上，还较普遍地存在着关门主义倾向。在社会主义改造事业中，纠正了右倾保守思想之后，在某些方面又产生了急躁冒进现象。工业建设和农牧业生产发展不相适应，有些应当办和可能办的厂矿办得少了，有些应当早办的厂矿办得迟了。对社会购买力的提高和群众对商品供应的要求估计不足，不断发生商品脱销或积压的现象。产生这些缺点和错误的原因，主要是对中央和毛泽东同志关于少数民族地区的政策和指示领会得不够，对社会主义的发展形势和各民族人民的社会主义积极性估计不足，对新疆地区的情况缺乏及时深入的了解。大会并作出决议，要求克服以上缺点，动员新疆党内外一切力量，来实现党在过渡时期的总路线和党在民族问题方面的总任务，完成社会主义改造和社会主义建设的历史任务。决议要求今后必须有计划地、定期地、系统地、深入地检查民族政策执行的情况，切实防止和纠正各种违反民族政策的行为，并认真学习民族政策、理论和语文。决议强调今后必须加强党委的集体领导，切实改进党委的会议制度，有计划有准备地讨论问题，特别是要有计划有准备地讨论有关方针、政策性的问题，必须定期检查领导和决议执行的情况，开展批评和自我批评。领导干部要深入下去，深入群众。
    大会选举了本届新的中共新疆维吾尔自治区委员会委员和出席中共第八次全国代表大会的代表。
