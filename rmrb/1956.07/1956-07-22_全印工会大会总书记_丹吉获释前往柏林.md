Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, July 21st: According to a report by the Indian Press Trust, the Bombay government issued a press release on the evening of July 20th, announcing the revocation of the order to detain Dange, General Secretary of the All-India Trade Union Congress and member of the Politburo of the Communist Party of India. Dange was detained in January this year for allegedly being involved in the disturbances caused by the demand to incorporate Bombay City into the planned Maharashtra state.

Dange was granted parole in April because of his wife's serious illness. Later, his parole was repeatedly extended to enable him to care for his sick wife.

Dange and his wife flew to Berlin on July 19th to seek medical treatment for her illness.

    丹吉获释前往柏林
    新华社新德里21日电　据印度报业托辣斯报道：孟买政府在七月二十日晚间发表新闻公报，宣布撤销关于拘留全印工会大会总书记、印度共产党政治局委员丹吉的命令。丹吉是在今年一月间由于据说同要求把孟买市并入计划中的马哈拉施特拉邦而引起的骚动有牵连而被拘留起来的。
    丹吉在四月间由于他的妻子患重病而获得假释。后来，为了使他能够照料他的生病的妻子，曾经屡次延长他的假释期。
    丹吉同他的妻子已经在七月十九日乘飞机前往柏林，以便在那里为她诊治疾病。
