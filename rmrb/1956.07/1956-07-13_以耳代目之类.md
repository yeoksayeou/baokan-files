    Those Who Substitute Ears for Eyes
    Zang Kejia

    During the widespread acclaim for "Fifteen Strings of Cash," I ran into a friend I hadn't seen in a long time. I asked him what he thought of the sensational play. He replied, "The performance technique isn't very perfect."
    "When did you see it?"
    "I didn't see it."
    "If you didn't see it, how do you know the performance technique isn't very perfect?"
    "I heard it from a colleague."
    This kind of ear-for-eye substitution is startling, but it isn't uncommon.
    Whenever an issue arises in the literary and art world, everyone always adopts a "not leading the world" attitude, pricking up their ears to listen for others' opinions, looking towards Beijing, hoping to hear something from "Literary Gazette" and "People's Literature." If "People's Daily" publishes an article, it's like a final verdict, and they're delighted to have found a "basis." Li Bai climbed the Yellow Crane Tower and lamented that he "can't write about the scene before me" because "Cui Hao's poem is already on top." Today, many people in the literary and art world are afraid to express their opinions before others have expressed theirs.
    I often have the opportunity to read such published and unpublished papers. The articles are truly like a "Korean tide and Su sea," filled with what Stalin said, what Gorky said, what Lu Xun said… As a reader, what I want to hear is what the author themselves has to say, but unfortunately, the article is precisely lacking this point. The masters' opinions are also the author's opinions. Calling this a thesis is better called a "miscellaneous collection of wise sayings." The first example is substituting ears for eyes; this situation deserves to be called "substituting eyes for brains."
    Many people, regarding new problems that appear in literature and art, are always speculating, not speculating about the problem itself, but speculating about the views and opinions of "authoritative" figures and leaders on the problem. In this way, they can always "stand in a position of no fault," but unfortunately, they will also always be out of touch with the truth.
    Writing this, the image of Bian He appears before my eyes. He presented the jade he obtained from the Chu mountains to King Li of Chu, but King Li said he was deceiving him and cut off his left foot. In the era of King Wu, he went to present the treasure again, and as a result, he lost his other foot. When King Wen came to the throne, he held his jade and cried under the Chu mountains for three days and three nights, crying to the point of "exhausting his tears and continuing with blood." The King of Chu heard this and sent someone to ask him. He said, "I am not sad about being mutilated, but saddened that the precious jade is labeled as stone, and the virtuous are named as deceivers." "The king then ordered the jade craftsman to work the jade and obtain the treasure." This is the famous He Shi Bi in history. See how insightful this He Shi was! Through the stone shell, he could see that what was hidden inside must be precious jade! With this firm belief, he could maintain the spirit of fighting for the truth even after losing both feet. Now, when a hundred schools of thought are contending, we must dare to speak out our own views and insist on these views. Of course, first, we must painstakingly study to establish these views of our own. Bian He's spirit is moving, but first, he saw accurately that what was wrapped in the stone shell was indeed precious jade.

    以耳代目之类
    臧克家
    在满城争说“十五贯”的时候，和一位许久不见面的朋友碰到了一起，我问他对这个轰动一时的戏有什么观感。他回答说：“演出的技术并不很完美。”
    “你什么时候看的？”
    “我并没有看。”
    “没有看你怎么知道演出的技术不很完美？”
    “听同事说的。”
    这种以耳代目的情况是令人吃惊的，但这种情况却并不是罕见的。
    文艺界里有什么问题发生了，大家总是以“不为天下先”的态度侧起耳朵探听别人的意见，远方的，企望着北京，想从“文艺报”、“人民文学”上听到一点动静，如果“人民日报”发表了什么文章，那就像定了案，自己欣喜得到了“依据”。李太白登上“黄鹤楼”，慨叹于“眼前有景说不得”，因为“崔灏题诗在上头”。今天文艺界里却有不少人，怯于表示自己的意见在别人的意见尚未表示之前。
    常有机会读到这样一些已发表和未发表的论文。文章真似“韩潮苏海”，其中充满着斯大林如何说，高尔基如何说，鲁迅如何说……作为读者，想听见的是作者本人如何说，可惜文章里偏偏就缺少了这一点，大师们的意见也就是作者的意见，这叫做论文毋宁叫作“嘉言录杂烩”。开头的一例是以耳代目，这种情况，叫它“以目代脑”，当受之而无愧。
    许多人对于文艺方面出现的新问题，总是在揣摩，并不是揣摩这问题的本身，而是揣摩“权威”人士和领导方面对这问题的看法和意见。这样，可以永远“立于无过之地”，可惜也永远和真理无缘。
    写到这里，我眼前出现了卞和的形象。他把得自楚山中的璞奉献给楚厉王，厉王说他欺骗，削去了他的左脚。武王时代，他又去献宝，结果是失去了他另外的那一只脚。到了文王临朝，他抱着他的璞在楚山之下哭了三天三夜，哭到“泣尽而继之以血”的程度。楚王听见了，使人问他，他说：“吾非悲刖也，悲夫宝玉而题之以石，贞士而名之以诳”。“王乃使玉人理其璞而得宝焉。”这便是历史上有名的和氏之璧。看这位和氏是何等真知灼见，隔着石头外壳他能看到其中蕴藏的必是宝玉！有了这一定不移的看法，他才能失去双脚还坚持为真理奋斗的精神。在眼前百家争鸣的时候，我们要敢于说出自己的见解，并坚持这见解，当然，首先要苦心钻研建立这种自己的见解。卞和的精神是动人的，但首先他看准了包在石头外壳当中的确是宝玉。
