Several Questions on the Reform of Opera Art
Zhao Feng

In recent years, Chinese opera troupes have traveled to Europe and Asian countries to perform, and have been widely welcomed. Last year, the performance of the China Art Troupe at the Paris International Theatre Festival was called a major event in Western European cultural life in the past fifty years. Playwrights from France, Britain, and Italy believe that Chinese opera will have a broad and profound impact on Western stage art in terms of content and form. This marks the correctness and victory of the Party's literary and artistic policies, and thoroughly shatters the reactionary literary and artistic theories that adopt a nihilistic attitude towards national heritage. If we consider the problems in future opera reform work based on some experiences from foreign performances, it will be beneficial. However, these experiences in artistic work have not yet been seriously discussed, so I would like to put forward some immature opinions first.

We might as well first study the evaluations of Chinese opera art by people and critics from various countries. Generally speaking, these evaluations can be concentrated into the following points. First, the popular and mass nature of Chinese opera. Critics from various political positions and artistic schools in Europe and Asia unanimously recognize the high degree of populism and the long-standing tradition of realism in Chinese opera. They pay special attention to the easy-to-understand and mass-oriented characteristics of opera. Second, unique characteristics and styles in terms of performance methods. In particular, the comprehensive form of singing and dancing, and the scripting method that is not restricted by changes in time and place. Third, the perfect training, superb skills of the actors, and the national characteristics of stage art. In addition, and most importantly, the achievements of China's opera reform work are more appreciated by foreign critics, who believe that this is the best respect and active inheritance of national traditions. French literary critics often quote the phrase "Let a hundred flowers bloom, weed through the old to bring forth the new," and believe that this sentence is also very inspiring for their work.

It should be affirmed that one of the fundamental reasons why Chinese opera can be widely welcomed in Europe and Asia is the correct reform of the content and art of opera repertoires in recent years.

Here, I will not discuss the reform of the content of opera repertoires for the time being, but only talk about some specific issues in artistic reform.

European playwrights highly praise the fact that Chinese opera does not adhere to the limitations of time and place in scripting, and can explain the plot story from beginning to end. The Chinese opera scripting method is not restricted by the so-called "three unities" like the West, which is indeed a characteristic. However, it must be admitted that this advantage also brings corresponding disadvantages, that is, the procrastination in the narrative of the plot. This point has been mentioned by Comrade Xia Yan in "On the Adaptation of 'Fifteen Strings of Cash'" (People's Daily, May 17). It is very necessary to carry out the work of removing the dross and selecting the essence, and "reducing the clues and establishing the main idea" according to the ideological content of the theme of the repertoire and the development of the characters' thoughts, feelings, and personalities. This should be the case not only in the adaptation of repertoires, but also in performance. We can use the repertoire "Crossroads," which is the most famous abroad, as an example to illustrate. During the tour of Zhang Yunxi and Zhang Chunhua in Western Europe, they shortened this play to only about twenty-five minutes, but did not delete the necessary plots and performance details. It is precisely because of the high concentration and refinement in the performance that they were praised by European drama critics as talented performing artists who "deserve to be ranked among contemporary performing masters such as Chaplin." The play "Crossroads" originally had too much repetition and redundancy in the middle. For example, the "groping in the dark" movements of Ren Tanghui and Liu Lihua were sometimes referred to as "unnecessary or excessive" by European drama colleagues due to excessive repetition. In fact, Zhang Yunxi and Zhang Chunhua themselves also admitted that the repeated "groping in the dark" was sometimes only for the pure pursuit of performance effects, and sometimes even developed by the actors to gain physical rest on the stage. This is like a glass of good wine, which will lose its mellowness if too much water is added. This is the case with martial arts plays, and there are similar aspects in singing plays. For example, some repertoires often make actors feel overwhelmed due to too many lyrics. Because, even the most beautiful colors cannot show brilliance even if they appear too many times, and may even make people feel tired. Therefore, it is necessary to immediately start the work of exploring the inherent musical structure of traditional Chinese repertoires, compressing the excessively decorated lyrics, and changing the shortcomings of focusing on script writing from a purely literary point of view since the Yuan Dynasty. Ye Sheng Lan and Du Jin Fang, Li Zongyi and Zhao Wenkui, these four comrades, during their tour in Western Europe, focused on the requirements of plot, characters, and music, and carried out the work of compressing and refining the musical structure of the two plays "Broken Bridge" and "Eliminating Three Evils." The successful experience in this should also be valued.

Chinese opera music has unique national characteristics. For example, Peking Opera uses several classic tunes to fix the form of the musical structure, and the amazing expressive ability of the percussion band. However, it should also be admitted that Chinese opera music must be enriched accordingly, and the method of using percussion band accompaniment from beginning to end should be appropriately changed. The currently applied method of quoting inherent opera tunes can be said to be a good start. When Comrade Wang Mingzhong performed the scene of stealing peaches in "Havoc in Heaven" in Western Europe, he omitted a section of singing, but the band still accompanied the performance with the tune of "Xiqianying," which made his performance movements have the same high sense of rhythm as using percussion band accompaniment, and did not lose the style characteristics of opera performance at all. At the end of "Broken Bridge," due to the quotation of a section of tune music, when Xu Xian and Bai Suzhen reconciled and left the stage together, compared with the old performance method of only using the small gong to beat "Ta Ta Ta Ta" to accompany the actors off the stage, the emotions were more full and powerfully assisted the actors' performance. Due to the fact that the rhythm of the percussion band in Chinese opera performances can be fast or slow, the actors' performances are often loose and weak. If the music can be fixed, that is, set down the score, it will definitely make the performance rhythm more adaptable to the requirements of the plot. One of the best ways to gradually set the score is to quote the inherent tune music of opera on the basis of maintaining the rhythm of the inherent percussion band, so that the accompaniment music can be gradually fixed in musical score and fixed speed according to the needs of the performance. At the same time, it can also have the effect of enriching the music.

Necessary reforms can also be considered in scenery and costumes. For example, the use of lighting effects will not bring any drawbacks to the inherent style of opera. Appropriately increasing scenery suitable for the performance style and certain act breaks and ending treatments, like the Kunqu Opera "Fifteen Strings of Cash," ending each act by stopping the performance on a certain "rest" to close the curtain, makes the end of each act more infectious. Regarding Chinese opera costumes, although European artists praised their gorgeous colors on the one hand, they also suggested to us to "prevent excessive complexity from hindering the actors' performances, and especially should advocate modern production methods that use less valuable materials to achieve the same artistic effect." This is a good collegial advice and should be taken seriously.

Of course, just like the reform of the content of repertoires, the key to carrying out artistic reform also lies in how to specifically and meticulously distinguish the essence and dross in our opera heritage, and truly remove the dross and select the essence. However, it must also be admitted that artistic reform must also overcome some conservative views. For example, regarding the issue of enriching music, it is necessary to boldly break some old conventions. The old habit of the accompaniment music's size (speed) being able to be long or short, and being able to temporarily decide before or after the horse (accelerating or slowing down) according to the actors' requirements, is an obstacle to the progress of performing arts. Because musical art must obey the requirements of strict time regulations, otherwise, the same musical material (tunes and rhythms, etc.) will produce completely different effects due to different speeds. Since it is a reform, it is necessary to break some conventions, and the principle of "no destruction, no construction" is easy to understand. More importantly, we know that the so-called inheritance of cultural heritage is not the ultimate goal. The purpose of inheritance is for better development. The key lies in how to prevent rude attitudes at any time in active reform.

When Chinese opera was performed in Western Europe, the main experiences in artistic work were: First, constantly carrying out the refinement of the performance, that is, starting from the plot and characters, requiring a more refined and accurate expression of the rich content of the repertoire. This is by no means a simple deletion, but requires the expression of the content of the repertoire and the expression techniques of the characters to be highly economical and consistent. Second, developing the unique characteristics of the percussion band and strictly requiring its rhythm, and on this basis, quoting appropriate tunes to enrich the musicality of opera. Third, under the principle of not destroying style characteristics and not hindering performance, using necessary modern stage art and technical methods, such as scenery methods (which naturally involves the processing of act breaks and endings) and lighting effects. These practices have been effective abroad, so they are proposed for reference by comrades engaged in opera work.

    戏曲艺术改革的几个问题
    赵沨
    最近几年，我国的戏曲团体赴欧、亚各国旅行演出，普遍受到热烈的欢迎。去年，中国艺术团在巴黎国际戏剧节的演出被称为五十年来西欧文化生活中的重大事件，法国、英国、意大利的戏剧家都认为中国戏曲将在内容和形式上广泛而深刻地影响西方舞台艺术。这标志着党的文艺政策的正确和胜利，也彻底粉碎了对民族遗产采取虚无主义态度的反动文艺理论。如果我们根据国外演出的一些经验来考虑一下今后戏曲改革工作中的问题，是会有好处的。只是这些艺术工作上的经验还没有经过认真的讨论，因此，我愿意先提出一些不成熟的意见。
    我们不妨先研究一下各国人民和评论家对我国戏曲艺术的评价。大体说，这些评价可以集中为如下的几点。一、中国戏曲的通俗性和群众性。欧亚各国不同政治立场和艺术流派的评论家都一致公认中国戏曲的高度人民性和久远的现实主义传统，更特别注意戏曲的通俗易懂和联系大量群众的特点。二、表现方式上独具特点和风格。特别是载歌载舞的综合形式和不受时间地点变换的限制的编剧方法。三、演员的完美训练、精湛技巧和舞台美术的民族特色。此外，也是最重要的，我国戏曲改革工作的成就更为国外评论家所乐道，他们认为这才是对民族传统的最好的尊重和积极的继承。法国的文艺批评家们也常常引用“百花齐放，推陈出新”这句话，并且认为这句话对他们的工作也很有启发的意义。
    应该肯定的说，我国戏曲之所以能在欧亚各国受到普遍的欢迎，在艺术上的根本原因之一正是近年来在戏曲剧目的内容上和艺术上所进行的正确改革的结果。
    这里暂且不讨论在戏曲剧目内容上进行改革的问题，只谈一些艺术改革中的具体问题。
    欧洲的戏剧家很称赞我国戏曲在编剧上不拘泥于时间、地点的限制，而能把剧情故事交代得有头有尾有始有终的方法。我国戏曲编剧方法不像西方那样受着所谓“三一律”的限制，这的确是个特点。然而必须承认，随着这优点也带来了相应的缺点，那便是剧情叙述上的拖沓。此点，夏衍同志在“论‘十五贯’的改编”（五月十七日“人民日报”）一文中已有论及。根据剧目主题的思想内容和人物思想、感情、性格的发展，作必要的去芜存精，“减头绪、立主脑”的工作，是十分必要的。不仅在剧目改编工作中应该如此，在表演中也必须从这方面来考虑。我们可以用在国外最负盛名的“三岔口”这个剧目为例来说明，张云溪、张春华同志在西欧旅行演出中把这出戏缩短到只演二十五分钟左右，但不删减必要的情节和表演的细节。正是由于在表演上的高度集中和洗练，他们被欧洲的戏剧评论家誉之为“列于当代表演大师卓别麟等之行列中而无愧”的天才表演艺术家。“三岔口”这出戏中间本来有着过多的重复和累赘，比如像任堂惠和刘利华的“摸黑”动作，有时由于过多的反复，便曾被欧洲的戏剧同行们称之为“不必要的或过分的”。而事实上，张云溪、张春华同志本人也承认，多次重复的“摸黑”，有时只是为了单纯追求表演效果，有时甚至于是演员争取在台上休息体力而发展出来的。这正像一杯好酒，掺水过多是只会失去了醇味的。武功戏如此，唱工戏也有类似的方面。比如有些剧目由于过多的唱词，常使演员们疲于应付。因为，即使是最美丽的色彩，过多的反复出现也不能显出光艳甚至还会使人厌倦的。所以，发掘我国传统剧目固有的音乐结构的规律，压缩过多的雕饰的唱词，来改变自元曲以来过多从纯文学的观点来着眼剧本写作的缺点，这是应该立即着手的工作。叶盛兰和杜近芳，李宗义和赵文奎这四位同志在西欧旅行演出中，把“断桥”和“除三害”两出戏，从剧情、人物、音乐各方面的要求来着眼，进行了音乐结构上的压缩和洗练的工作，其中的成功经验也是应该重视的。
    中国戏曲音乐有着独具的民族特色。比如京戏用若干个典范的曲调来把音乐结构的形式固定下来，以及打击乐队所具有的惊人表现能力等都是。但同时也应该承认我国戏曲音乐必须予以应有的丰富，像自始至终用打击乐队伴奏的方式便应该适当地改变。目前已开始应用的引用戏曲固有曲牌的办法可以说是一个很好的起步。王鸣仲同志在西欧演出“闹天宫”中偷桃一场时省去了一段歌唱，但乐队仍然伴随着表演的进行奏出“喜迁莺”的曲调，这使他的表演动作有着和使用打击乐队伴奏同样的高度节奏感，丝毫也没有失去戏曲表演的风格特点。在“断桥”终场时，由于引用了一段曲牌音乐，许仙、白素贞言归于好后一同下场时，比之旧的演出只用小锣“太太太太”的敲打来伴和演员下场的办法，便使情绪更为饱满，有力地帮助了演员的表演。我国戏曲的演出，由于打击乐队在节奏上可快可慢，常使演员的表演松懈无力。如果能把音乐固定化，就是定下谱来，一定会使表演节奏更能适应剧情的要求。而逐步定谱的最好方法之一便是在保持固有打击乐队的节奏基础上引用戏曲固有的曲牌音乐曲调，这样就可以逐步根据表演需要而把伴奏音乐固定乐谱、固定速度。同时还可以兼收丰富音乐的效果。
    在布景和服装上，也可以考虑必要的改革。比如运用灯光效果是不会对戏曲固有风格带来任何弊病的。而适当地增加适应表演风格的布景以及一定的分幕、终场处理，像昆曲“十五贯”那样，每幕结束时使表演终止在一个一定的“休止”上闭幕，这便使每幕的结束更富于感染力。关于我国戏曲服装，欧洲各国艺术家虽然一方面赞叹其色彩的华丽，但也向我们提出了“防止过份的繁琐而妨碍演员表演，特别应该提倡少用贵重材料而能达到同样艺术效果的现代制作方法”的意见，这是很好的同行式的忠告，也应引起我们重视的。
    当然，正象对剧目内容的改革工作一样，进行艺术改革的关键也同样在于如何具体、细致地分辨我们的戏曲遗产中的精华和糟粕，真正做到去芜存精。但也必须承认，进行艺术改革也要克服一些保守的观点，比如关于丰富音乐问题，就需要大胆地打破某些旧的成规。像伴奏音乐的尺寸（速度）可长可短，可以根据演员要求临时决定马前或马后（加快或放慢）的旧习惯，便是妨碍表演艺术进步的障碍。因为音乐艺术必须服从严格的时间规定的要求，否则，将会使同样的音乐素材（曲调和节奏等）由于速度快慢不同而产生判然不同的效果。既然是改革，那须要打破一些成规，不破不立的道理是很容易了解的。而更重要的是，我们知道，继承文化遗产的所谓继承，并不是最终的目的，继承的目的是为了更好的发展。而关键是在于如何在积极的改革中随时防止粗暴的态度。
    我国戏曲在西欧演出时，在艺术工作上的主要经验是：一、随时不断地进行表演的精练工作，就是从情节和人物出发，要求更精练地、准确地表现剧目的丰富内容。这决不同于简单地删节，而是要求剧目内容的表达和人物形象表现手法的高度经济和集中相一致。二、发展打击乐队的独具特点并严格其节奏要求，在这个基础上引用适当曲调来丰富戏曲的音乐性。三、在不破坏风格特点和不妨碍表演的原则下，运用必要的现代舞台美术和技术方法，如布景的方法（这就自然牵连到分幕、终场的处理）和灯光的效果等。这些作法在国外行之有效，因而提出来请从事戏曲工作的同志们参考。
