Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, July 6th. The early rice harvest has begun in most parts of Guangdong Province, seven to ten days earlier than in previous years. Reports of good harvests are pouring in from various regions during the harvest. The recently harvested approximately five million mu of "Nante" variety early rice has generally seen a yield increase of 10% to 30% compared to last year. In the Pearl River Delta, many rice paddies that have transitioned from double-cropping intercropping to double-cropping continuous cropping have seen yields increase from over 200 jin per mu in the past to 400-500 jin.

Among the harvested early rice, many high-yield fields with yields reaching 700 jin, 800 jin, and even exceeding 1,000 jin per mu have emerged. These high-yield fields not only appeared in the Chaoshan Plain, which has always been known for its high yields, but also in areas that only began to change their backward farming techniques this year. For example, in the Hainan Li and Miao Autonomous Prefecture, where early rice generally only yielded 200 jin per mu in previous years, this year there are 47 mu with yields as high as over 1,000 jin per mu, and another 2,400 mu with yields of over 800 jin per mu. According to estimates by the Guangdong Provincial Department of Agriculture, this year's early rice harvest across the province is expected to increase by approximately 15% compared to last year.

    广东早稻开始大割
    估计全省可比去年增产百分之十五
    新华社广州6日电　广东省大部地区的早稻开始大割，今年大割的时间比往年提前了七天至十天。各地在收割时纷报丰收。最近收割的约五百万亩的“南特”号良种早稻，普遍比去年增产一成至三成。珠江三角洲许多从双季间作改为双季连作的稻田，每亩产量由往年的两百多斤增加到四、五百斤。
    在已收割了的早稻中，出现了不少单位面积产量达到七百斤、八百斤以至超过一千斤的丰产田。这些丰产田不但出现在一向以高额产量著称的潮汕平原，还出现在今年才开始改变落后耕作技术的地区。如往年早稻一般每亩只有二百斤的海南黎族苗族自治州，今年早稻竟有四十七亩每亩产量高达一千多斤，另外还有二千四百多亩每亩都在八百斤以上。据广东省农业厅的估计，今年全省早稻可比去年增产15％左右。
