    The Horse That Doesn't Eat Grass

    In many places in our country, especially in the southern provinces, farmers use wind-powered waterwheels. These wind-powered waterwheels require someone to watch over them day and night, and the wind cover direction and the position of the wind turbine frame have to be moved whenever the wind direction changes slightly. Recently, the Xitang Woodware Production Cooperative in Jiashan County, Zhejiang Province, manufactured a wind-powered waterwheel that can automatically adjust to the wind direction. When there is a level 3 wind, this wind turbine can pump about 40 tons of water per hour, which is equivalent to the work of a three-and-a-half horsepower water pump, and its price is less than one-fifth of a small water pump. Therefore, farmers call it "the horse that doesn't eat grass, the machine that doesn't use oil."

    The Xitang Woodware Production Cooperative has already manufactured more than 100 such waterwheels to supply farmers in Jiashan, Pinghu, Haiyan and other places. Representatives from the Wenzhou Special District handicraft industry departments have come to learn the manufacturing methods. Now, this new type of waterwheel has also appeared in the fields along the coast of Wenzhou.

    不吃草的马
    我国很多地方，特别是南方各省农民，都使用风力水车。这些风力水车，白天黑夜都要有人看守，风向稍有转变，就得移动风篷的方向和风车架的位置。最近，浙江省嘉善县西塘木器生产合作社制造一种能自动调整风向的风力水车。这种风车在刮三级风的时候，每小时车水四十吨左右，相当于一部三匹半马力抽水机的工作量，而它的价格还不到一部小型抽水机的五分之一。所以农民们把它叫做“不吃草的马，不用油的机器”。
    西塘木器生产合作社已经制造了一百多架这样的水车供应嘉善、平湖、海盐等地农民使用。温州专区手工业部门的代表们，曾来学习制造方法。现在温州沿海一带的田野里，也出现了这种新式水车。
