    越南祖国战线向南越发出呼吁
    欢迎建立南北接触促进了解
    据新华社河内22日电　越南祖国战线中央委员会主席孙德胜今天宣布，越南祖国战线、北越各政党、宗教、社会团体和各界人士欢迎南越派代表到北越来访问，并愿意派代表到南越去访问，以建立两地区间的接触和创造两地区间互相信任了解的气氛。
    孙德胜在今天上午举行的庆祝越南恢复和平两周年的大会上，提出了这作为走向国家统一的第一个步骤的建议。
    参加大会的六万五千人最后通过了一个决议，支持胡志明主席在七月六日发表的关于和平统一越南的文告。这个决议要求南越当局严格履行日内瓦协定和接受越南民主共和国政府关于召开协商会议来讨论全国普选的建议。
    决议要求南越当局取消阻碍北南两地区间建立正常关系的措施，尊重两地区间的往来自由。决议还表示要努力巩固北越，支持南越人民的斗争。
