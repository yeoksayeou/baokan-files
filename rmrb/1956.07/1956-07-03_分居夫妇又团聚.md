    Separated Couple Reunited
    Mi Fusheng, a member of the Mingxing Agricultural Cooperative in Jinhua Township, Xiangxiang County, Hunan Province, is a cripple. Before liberation, he often relied on begging for rice to survive. After liberation, although he was allocated land and housing, he still had great difficulties in production and life due to his inconvenient limbs and lack of production technology and tools. He received government relief grain and funds every year, but it was still not enough to maintain his life. Because of this, he and his wife often quarreled, even to the point of separation. His wife took their three-year-old child to her parents' home and proposed to divorce him.
    This year, after he joined the cooperative in February, the cooperative took good care of him, always arranging suitable work for him. The group leader also taught him production techniques. With the care and help of the cooperative, Mi Fusheng was very active in work and was able to complete his tasks on time and with guaranteed quality. By the time of the preliminary distribution of spring crops, he had already worked 53.9 workdays, and he could do another 50 workdays by the autumn harvest. According to the cooperative's calculation of 1.6 yuan per workday, plus his family's fertilizer investment, he can earn more than 170 yuan this year.
    The news of Mi Fusheng's increased income spread quickly. With the help of the cooperative, his wife and children also returned. His whole family happily reunited and enthusiastically joined the cooperative's production.

    分居夫妇又团聚
    湖南湘乡县金花乡明星农业社社员米福生，是个跛子。在解放以前，常常靠讨米度日。解放后，虽分到了土地和房屋，但由于他手脚不大方便，再加上缺乏生产技术和工具，所以在生产和生活上仍有很大困难。政府每年发的救济粮、款他都有份，可是还不够维持生活。为此，他和老婆常常闹架，甚至闹的分了家。他老婆带上三岁的小孩上娘家去住，并提出要和他离婚。
    今年二月他入社以后，社里照顾的很周到，总是安排一些适当的工作让他去干。小组长还教给他生产技术。在社的照顾和帮助下，米福生出工很积极，并能按时保质完成任务。到春季作物预分的时候，他已做了五十三点九个劳动日，到秋收还可做五十个劳动日。按照社里每个劳动日一元六角钱计算，再加上他家的肥料投资，今年可分到一百七十多元。
    米福生收入增加的消息很快就传开了。在社的帮助下，他的老婆和孩子也回来了。他阖家高兴地团聚在一起，愉快地投入社的生产。
