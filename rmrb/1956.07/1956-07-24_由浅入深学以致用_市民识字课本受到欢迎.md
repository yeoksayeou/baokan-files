The first and second volumes have been published. The first volume has been issued 160,000 copies, and the second volume has been printed 130,000 copies. The first volume selected the vocabulary most needed in the daily lives of housewives. Housewives expressed satisfaction with the first volume's ability to connect with their actual lives. Some employees' family members said to their husbands: "You are learning production textbooks, and we are learning textbooks for living life." After learning this volume, they can keep simple daily accounts and read their children's report cards. The second and third volumes include: how housewives can do a good job in "Five Goods," general scientific knowledge, and content related to the capital and China's production and construction. After the students have completed these three volumes, they can recognize about 1,500 commonly used characters and have basic reading and writing skills. Generally, housewives can complete the course in a year and a half. At the same time, students can also receive socialist ideological education from the textbooks and know how to treat marriage, family, and children with socialist moral qualities.
