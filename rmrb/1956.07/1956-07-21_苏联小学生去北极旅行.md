Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, July 20th: A group of elementary school students from Moscow and Kyiv departed from Moscow on July 19th for the Arctic scientific station they had long desired to visit.

Most of these elementary school students are active members of the Young Polar Explorers and Seamen's Club of the Moscow Voroshilov District Children's Park. They began preparations for this trip last winter. They studied in radio technology, meteorology, hydroplane, and sailing groups. Several people who had been to the Arctic many times told them interesting stories about polar work and life.

The elementary school students' trip will last for about a month. During the trip, they will visit Dixon Island, which is not far from the mouth of the Yenisei River, which flows north in the Soviet Union. Experienced teachers will guide their various activities during the trip. The Soviet Academy of Sciences and the Northern Sea Route Administration have made some requests to the children, hoping that they will learn about the history of the Arctic scientific station, become familiar with the lives and customs of the local residents, and collect some specimens.

    苏联小学生去北极旅行
    新华社莫斯科20日电　莫斯科和基辅来的一批小学生七月十九日从莫斯科出发到他们早就想望的北极科学站去。
    这批小学生大部分是莫斯科沃列斯克区儿童公园少年极地研究者和海员俱乐部的积极分子。还在去年冬季，他们就开始了这次旅行的准备工作。他们在无线电技术小组和气象小组以及水上汽艇和帆船小组中，进行了学习。一些多次到过北极的人给他们讲了许多有关极地工作和生活的有趣的见闻。
    小学生们的这次旅行将历时一个来月。在旅行期间，他们将访问迪克逊岛。这个岛在苏联向北流的叶尼塞河河口外不远的地方。在旅行中将有一些有经验的老师辅导他们的各种活动。苏联科学院和北方海运管理局向孩子们提出了一些要求，希望他们了解北极科学站的历史，熟悉当地居民的生活和习惯，收集一些标本。
