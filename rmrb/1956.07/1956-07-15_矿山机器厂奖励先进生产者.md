On July 8th, a typical Sunday. At noon that day, the temperature in Shanghai reached over 100 degrees Fahrenheit. In the evening, there was a rainstorm, and the weather turned cooler—this has been the standard climate in Shanghai recently.

Everything was as usual; many workers in Shanghai continued production (they implement a rotation system for rest according to electricity scheduling), and many others enjoyed their holidays. The people of Shanghai are good at enjoying life, and the hot weather cannot thwart their interest in life.

Shanghai's Sunday activities are becoming increasingly rich. Here are some aspects of that day, July 8th.

Mine Machinery Factory Rewards Advanced Producers

On the evening of July 8th, the Shanghai Mine Machinery Factory held a general meeting of all employees to reward advanced producers. The ranks of advanced producers at the Mine Machinery Factory have become quite large, with an average of one advanced producer for every three employees in the factory.

Since the factory launched the advanced producer movement in the first quarter, a new atmosphere has emerged in production, and many workers have exceeded their quotas. For example, caster Zhu Gengsheng, who had not fulfilled his quota for eight months after entering the factory, has completed his plan for three consecutive months during the advanced producer movement. Han Qiliang, a shearer in the metalworking workshop, had difficulty meeting the quota for processing forging drill parts. Later, he improved a mold, changing from shearing two pieces at a time to ten pieces at a time, completing the 25-hour task in six hours. Learning from advanced experiences has become a trend in the Mine Machinery Factory. Currently, seventeen advanced experiences, such as rapid steelmaking, tide mold modeling, and easy cutting of risers, have been promoted within the factory. The metalworking workshop promoted the Kuzovkin rapid cutting method, which originally took two minutes to make one piece, now only takes two seconds to cut. Using an acid furnace to smelt manganese steel, the steelmaking furnace can produce more than three tons of steel per working day for the country. Labor model and caster Zhu Jisheng helped new worker Wang Chengda improve the core tool, reducing the time to make a core from twenty minutes to eight minutes. Currently, 90% of the new workers in the factory can meet the quota.

After the launch of the advanced producer movement, staff and technicians from various departments also actively participated in the competition. Wang Hongfeng, a technical designer who had just graduated from school, learned the advanced experience of "coordinate drawing," completing the design work of the hoist components six days ahead of schedule, reaching the level of an advanced producer. Engineer Zheng Zhaozhao completed the design task forty-five days ahead of schedule in the second quarter and was named an advanced producer. (Qian Shiquan)

### 矿山机器厂奖励先进生产者

    七月八日，一个普通的星期日。这天中午，上海的温度达到了华氏一百度以上。傍晚，下了一场暴雨，天也转凉了——这是上海最近以来的标准气候。
    一切都和往常一样，上海的许多工人在继续生产（他们按照用电的调度实行轮流休息制），也有许多人愉快地度过了假日。上海人是善于快乐地生活的，炎热的气候挫折不了他们的生活兴趣。
    上海星期日的活动，现在是愈来愈丰富了。这里报道的是七月八日这一天的几个侧面。
    矿山机器厂奖励先进生产者
    七月八日的晚上，上海矿山机器厂召开了全厂职工大会，奖励先进生产者。矿山机器厂先进生产者的队伍已经相当壮大，全厂平均在每三个职工中就有一个先进生产者。
    这个厂从第一季度开展先进生产者运动以来，生产上出现了一片新气象，许多工人突破了定额。如铸工朱更生，进厂后八个月一直没有完成定额，在先进生产者运动中，连续三个月都完成计划。金工车间铡工韩其良，加工锻钎机零件一直很难达到定额，后来改进了一只模子，将二件一铡改为十件一铡，二十五小时的任务，六小时就完成了。学习先进经验在矿山机器厂已成为风气，目前厂内已经推行的有快速炼钢、潮模造型、易割冒口等十七种先进经验。金工车间推行了库佐甫金快速割刀法，原来二分钟做一只的活，现在二秒钟就割好了。炼钢炉利用酸性炉炼锰钢，每一个工作日可为国家多炼三吨多钢。劳动模范铸工朱纪生，帮助新工人王成达改进泥心工具，使原来要二十分钟做好的泥心，八分钟就做好了。这个厂目前已有90％的新工人能达到定额。
    先进生产者运动开展后，各科室职员、技术人员也积极投入竞赛。刚从学校出来的技术设计员王洪凤，学习了“座标绘图”的先进经验，使卷扬机机件的设计工作，提前六天完成，达到先进生产者水平。工程师郑祖钊在第二季度中，提前四十五天完成设计任务，被评为先进生产者。　（钱士权）
