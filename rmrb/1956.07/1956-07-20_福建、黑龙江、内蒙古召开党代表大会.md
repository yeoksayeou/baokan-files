Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, July 18th: The First Congress of the Communist Party of China in Fujian Province, based on the province's work situation and its position at the forefront of national defense, has determined that in the future it will continue to strengthen its comprehensive leadership over socialist construction and socialist transformation, strengthen coastal defense work, and actively prepare for the liberation of coastal islands and the liberation of Taiwan.

The Congress was held in Fuzhou from June 27th to July 13th. The meeting fully promoted a democratic style, spending most of the time discussing the work report of the previous provincial committee and examining the leadership's work. Fifty-five attending and non-voting delegates spoke at the plenary session, affirming the achievements of the past work and frankly and strictly criticizing the shortcomings and errors of the provincial committee's leadership. Many people criticized the provincial committee for its one-sidedness and lack of foresight in its leadership thinking; in agricultural production, it focused on grain production but relaxed leadership over sideline occupations and some cash crops; and it did not pay enough attention to urban work, the development of local industry, and commercial work. The Party's political work was weak, which affected the failure of many cadres to establish the idea of serving socialist construction wholeheartedly, such as the existence of certain capitalist business styles in trade work. Ye Fei, First Secretary of the Provincial Committee, made a concluding speech on behalf of the Congress Presidium, in which he further analyzed the reasons for the shortcomings and errors in the leadership work and emphasized that democratic style should be strengthened and the mass line should be adhered to in future work.

The Congress believed that Fujian had made great achievements in various aspects of work, such as economy, national defense, overseas Chinese affairs, and carrying out mass anti-enemy struggles in recent years. At present, the number of farmer households joining cooperatives in the province has reached 88.3% of the total number of farmer households, of which 61.48% have joined advanced cooperatives. Around the autumn harvest this year, the province will basically realize advanced agricultural cooperation. Capitalist industry and commerce have now all implemented joint state-private ownership by whole trades, 90% of small merchants and peddlers have been transformed, and 81% of handicraft practitioners have joined cooperatives.

The Congress accepted the lessons of the past in not paying enough attention to the development of local industry, and expressed its determination to change Fujian's backward industrial state in a planned way (by the end of 1955, the output value of Fujian's modern industry only accounted for 11.32% of the total industrial and agricultural output value). The Congress resolved that in the future, local industries serving the rural economy and people's lives should be vigorously developed, and some industrial and mining enterprises for manufacturing fertilizers, agricultural implements, sugar, paper, shipbuilding, iron smelting, coal mining, and processing tea and timber should be planned and established.

The Congress believed that it is necessary to strengthen the thinking of comprehensive leadership in the future, and while ensuring the completion of grain production, to make full use of Fujian's favorable natural conditions such as many mountains and dense forests, numerous bays, and its location in the subtropical zone, to better develop cash crops, subtropical crops, and sideline production. To this end, the Congress specifically resolved to appropriately reduce the province's grain production increase plan targets within twelve years, in order to devote more efforts to the development of diversified economy and sideline production.

The meeting also studied overseas Chinese affairs and coastal defense struggles.

Finally, the Congress elected new provincial committee members and alternate members, and elected delegates to the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China. Before the election, the Congress conducted a serious discussion of the candidates and made criticisms of some candidates.

Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, July 17th: The First Congress of the Communist Party of China in Heilongjiang Province was held in Harbin from July 6th to 16th.

Based on the characteristics of Heilongjiang Province and the new situation in the development of socialist cause, the Congress determined the province's basic tasks and specific tasks of various major work in the future; and concentratedly criticized the bureaucracy in leadership style and the subjectivism and one-sidedness in cadres' thinking, as well as the shortcomings and errors in work.

The meeting pointed out that Heilongjiang Province is a newly emerging and important industrial area and an important agricultural and forestry area. At present, the proportion of industry in the total industrial and agricultural output value has accounted for 56.8%, of which modern industry accounts for 72.2%. A number of key projects are under construction, and it is expected that many new types of enterprises will be built here during the Second Five-Year Plan period. The province's grain output in 1955 reached 8.2 million tons, of which commodity grain accounted for 47%. There are also large areas of wasteland in the province equal to the total area of existing cultivated land that have not been reclaimed, and agriculture has broad prospects for development in the future. Heilongjiang Province's timber reserves account for 32.2% of the country's timber reserves. At present, the number of farmer households participating in advanced agricultural production cooperatives has accounted for 98.7% of the total number of farmer households in the province, and the socialist transformation of handicrafts and capitalist industry and commerce has also achieved a decisive victory. The socialist economy has become the basic economic form in the province.

Before the official opening of the Congress, a nine-day preparatory meeting was held to solicit delegates' opinions on the provincial committee's work report. The delegates put forward nearly a thousand amendments to the draft report. The provincial committee made significant revisions to the report based on these opinions. Seventy-six people spoke at the Congress, and fifty-one submitted written speeches. The delegates raised many criticisms and suggestions on the leadership work of the provincial committee and the work of various provincial-level departments. The Congress pointed out that the province had previously experienced a relatively widespread and serious right-leaning conservative ideology, which had been overcome to some extent through criticism and struggle, but now there are also hasty and rash advances in some work. In addition, one-sidedness often occurs in the arrangement of work. For example, after advanced cooperation, agricultural production was emphasized, but sideline production was neglected, resulting in a decline in sideline production.

The Congress's report, resolutions, and delegates' speeches all believed that the bureaucracy of the province's leading organs at all levels, their detachment from the masses, detachment from reality, lack of in-depth and specific work, untimely resolution of problems, lack of inspection of work implementation, and lack of understanding and concern for the suffering of the masses are the most serious problems and the most dangerous phenomena in the current work. The meeting analyzed the ideological and organizational roots of this phenomenon, put forward some improvement measures, especially emphasizing the need to carry forward the tradition of the mass line, and requiring cadres throughout the province to re-study the Central Committee's "Decision on Leadership Methods" to change the generalized leadership style.

The Congress elected a new Heilongjiang Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and delegates to the Eighth National Congress of the Party.

Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, July 18th: The First Congress of the Communist Party of China in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region resolved on the 17th that the Party organizations in Inner Mongolia should gradually shift the focus of their leadership to industry while continuing to strengthen their leadership over agricultural and pastoral production.

The Congress was held in Hohhot from July 5th to 17th. Ulanhu reported on behalf of the previous Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Committee of the Communist Party of China on the work in the ten months since the Party Congress in September 1955.

The Congress believed that the face of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has undergone historically significant changes in the past ten months. During this period, the historical task of promoting national regional autonomy was completed, ending the division of the Inner Mongolia ethnic groups for hundreds of years and providing an important guarantee for the further development of Inner Mongolia's national politics, economy, and culture. At present, the number of farmer households participating in agricultural production cooperatives in the region has reached more than 93% of the total number of farmer households, of which farmer households joining advanced cooperatives account for more than 77% of the total number of farmer households. In ethnic mixed areas, 4,374 ethnic joint cooperatives and agricultural-pastoral combined cooperatives have been established. Because the people of all ethnic groups are closely combined in production and have formed a flesh-and-blood relationship economically, the relationship between ethnic groups has also undergone fundamental changes. The cooperation of handicrafts and the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce have been basically completed. Significant achievements have also been made in the autonomous region's capital construction and industrial production.

The Congress focused on analyzing the new situation of industrial construction in the Inner Mongolia region, pointing out that the construction of the Baotou industrial base is approaching the peak construction years. The forest industry in the eastern region will have great development, and the Baotou-Lanzhou Railway is under construction. However, because these large-scale industries are starting from scratch, there are many difficulties and problems in the work. Therefore, the Congress believes that the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Committee of the Communist Party of China must foresee, plan, and solve every problem facing industrial construction in a timely manner based on the current changes, in order to ensure the realization of the state's construction tasks in the Inner Mongolia region.

The Congress promoted intra-party democracy, criticized and exposed the shortcomings in the leadership work of the previous committee. The Congress believed that due to the right-leaning conservatism of the leadership thinking and insufficient understanding of the major changes in the autonomous region, it failed to quickly and more forcefully shift the focus of leadership to economic construction. It was also insufficient in giving play to collective wisdom and listening to the opinions of the lower levels. Bureaucracy and red tape were relatively serious, it was not sensitive to new things, and it was not sufficient to give full play to the role of the government and to comprehensively lead the government work, and it handled a lot of specific work of a routine nature. The Party's ideological leadership was weak, which affected the development of various tasks. For example, although importance was attached to the state's key construction projects, there was insufficient publicity about its development scale, speed, and various aspects of support, so that the work could not keep up with the needs of development. The Congress also sharply criticized a kind of unconscious pride and complacency within the Party, which was manifested in estimating more achievements and less shortcomings and errors, and also in being content with the status quo, not systematically summarizing experience, and very poor at seriously learning from the experiences of fraternal regions, especially the ethnic minority regions.

To this end, the Congress pointed out that it is necessary to fully promote democracy, frequently carry out criticism and self-criticism, advocate independent thinking, oppose blind obedience, and quickly strengthen the Party's unity and Party building.

The Congress discussed and approved the work report of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Committee of the Communist Party of China, and elected thirty-five members and thirteen alternate members to form the new Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Committee of the Communist Party of China. At the same time, twenty-one delegates and two alternate delegates to the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China were elected.

399 Party member representatives from Mongolian, Han, Daur, Solon, Oroqen, Korean, Hui, Manchu and other ethnic groups attended the Congress, representing 151,756 Communist Party members.

    福建、黑龙江、内蒙古召开党代表大会
    据新华社福州18日电　中国共产党福建省第一次代表大会，根据福建省的工作情况和地处国防前线的特点，确定今后要继续加强对社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业的全面领导，加强海防工作、积极准备为解放沿海岛屿和解放台湾而斗争。
    代表大会从六月二十七日到七月十三日在福州市举行。会议充分发扬了民主作风，以大部分时间讨论了前届省委的工作报告和检查了领导工作。有五十五个出席和列席代表在全体大会上发言，他们肯定了过去的工作成绩，坦率而严格地批评了省委领导工作上的缺点和错误。很多人批评省委在领导思想上有片面性、缺乏预见性；在农业生产方面抓了粮食生产，但放松了副业和部分经济作物的领导；对城市工作、发展地方工业和商业工作等重视不够。党的政治工作薄弱，影响了不少干部未能很好地树立起一切为社会主义建设服务的思想，如贸易工作中存在着某些资本主义经营作风等。省委第一书记叶飞代表大会主席团作了会议总结，他进一步分析了领导工作中所产生的缺点和错误的原因，并强调指出今后在工作中要加强民主作风，坚持群众路线。
    代表大会认为，几年来福建在经济、国防、侨务和开展群众性对敌斗争等各方面的工作都取得了很大成绩。目前，全省入社农户已达总农户的88.3％。其中加入高级社的占总农户的61.48％。今年秋收前后，全省将基本上实现高级的农业合作化。资本主义工商业现已全部实行了全行业的公私合营，小商小贩已有90％进行了改造，手工业从业人员有81％加入了合作社。
    代表大会接受了过去不重视发展地方工业的教训，并且表示要决心有计划地改变福建工业的落后状态（到1955年止，福建现代工业产值只占工农业总产值的11.32％）。代表大会决议今后应大力发展为农村经济和人民生活服务的地方工业，有计划地举办一些制造肥料、制造农具、制糖、制纸、造船、炼铁、采煤和茶叶、木材的加工等工矿企业。
    代表大会认为今后必需加强全面领导的思想，在保证完成粮食生产的同时，要充分利用福建的山多林密、海湾众多和地处亚热带等有利的自然条件，更好地发展经济作物、亚热带作物和副业生产。为此，代表大会特决议适当减少这个省十二年内粮食增产计划指标，以较多的力量来发展多种经济和副业生产。
    会议对侨务工作和海防斗争也作了研究。
    代表大会最后选出了新的省委委员和候补委员，并且选出了出席中国共产党第八次全国代表大会的代表。在选举前，大会对候选人进行了认真讨论，并且对某些候选人提出了批评。
    据新华社哈尔滨17日电　中共黑龙江省第一次代表大会在七月六日到十六日在哈尔滨举行。
    这次代表大会根据黑龙江省的特点和当前社会主义事业发展的新形势，确定了全省今后的基本任务和各项主要工作的具体任务；并且集中地批判了领导作风上的官僚主义和干部思想中的主观主义和片面性以及工作中的缺点和错误。
    会议指出，黑龙江省是一个新兴的、重要的工业地区和重要的农业、林业地区，现在工业在工农业总产值中的比重已占56.8％，工业中现代工业占72.2％，有一批重点工程正在施工，预计第二个五年计划期间还将在这里新建不少新型企业。全省1955年产粮达八百二十万吨，其中商品粮占47％。省内还有约等于现有耕地面积总数的大片荒原未被开垦，将来农业有着广阔的发展前途。黑龙江省木材蓄积量占全国木材蓄积量的32.2％。现在参加高级农业生产合作社的农户已占全省农户总数的98.7％，手工业和资本主义工商业的社会主义改造也已取得决定性的胜利。社会主义经济已经成了省内的基本经济形态。
    代表大会在正式开会之前，进行了九天的预备会，征求代表们对省委工作报告的意见，代表们对报告草案提出了近千条修改意见。省委根据这些意见对报告作了很大的修改。在大会上有七十六人作了发言，有五十一人作了书面发言。代表们对省委的领导工作和省级各部门的工作，提出了很多批评和建议。代表大会指出，原来省内曾经有比较普遍的严重的右倾保守思想，经过批判斗争，有了一些克服，但现在又在某些工作中发现有急躁冒进情绪。另外，在工作的安排上也常常产生片面性，例如高级合作化以后强调了农业生产，但忽视了副业生产，致使副业生产出现衰退现象等等。
    代表大会的报告、决议和代表们的发言中都认为，省的各级领导机关的官僚主义，脱离群众、脱离实际，工作不深入、不具体，解决问题不及时，缺少对工作执行情况的检查，缺乏对群众生活疾苦的了解和关心，这是当前工作中最严重的问题和最危险的现象。会议分析了产生这种现象的思想上与组织上的根源，提出了一些改进措施，特别强调要发扬群众路线的传统，并且要求全省干部重新学习中央“关于领导方法的决定”，以改变一般化的领导作风。
    大会选举了新的中共黑龙江省委员会和出席党的第八次全国代表大会的代表。
    据新华社呼和浩特18日电　中国共产党内蒙古自治区第一次代表大会十七日决议，内蒙古地区的党组织今后在继续加强对农业牧业生产领导的同时，要逐渐把领导重点转移到工业方面来。
    这次代表大会是七月五日到十七日在呼和浩特市举行。乌兰夫代表上届中共内蒙古自治区委员会在会上报告了1955年9月党代表会议以后十个月来的工作情况。
    代表大会认为，十个月来内蒙古自治区的面貌发生了具有历史意义的变化。在这期间，完成了推行民族区域自治的历史任务，结束了内蒙古民族几百年来的分割状态，为内蒙古民族政治、经济、文化的进一步发展提供了重要的保证。现在全区参加农业生产合作社的农户已达农户总数的93％以上，其中加入高级社的农户占农户总数的77％以上。在民族杂居区，已建立起民族联合社和农牧结合社4，374个。由于各族人民在生产上密切结合，经济上形成了血肉关系，民族关系也发生了根本的变化。手工业的合作化和资本主义工商业的社会主义改造已经基本完成。自治区的基本建设和工业生产方面也取得了重大成就。
    代表大会着重分析了内蒙古地区当前工业建设的新形势，指出包头工业基地的建设已经接近建设高峰年代。东部地区的森林工业将有很大发展，包兰铁路正在修筑。但是由于这些大工业都是平地起家，所以工作中的困难和问题也多。因此，代表大会认为，内蒙古自治区党委要根据当前的变化情况有预见、有计划地和及时地解决工业建设中面临的每一个问题，以保证实现国家在内蒙古地区的建设任务。
    这次代表大会发扬了党内民主，批评和揭发了上届党委领导工作中的缺点。代表大会认为，由于领导思想的右倾保守，对自治区的重大变化认识不足，因而没有能够迅速地把领导重点更加有力地转向经济建设。发挥集体智慧和听取下边意见也不够。官僚主义和文牍主义比较严重，对新鲜事物嗅觉不灵，对充分发挥政府作用和对政府工作的全面领导不够，带事务性的具体工作包办不少。党的思想领导薄弱，影响了各项工作的开展。例如，虽然重视了国家的重点建设工程，但对它的发展的规模、速度和各方面的支援则宣传不够，使工作赶不上发展的需要。代表大会还尖锐地批评了党内一种不自觉的骄傲自满情绪，这种情绪表现在对成绩估计得多，对缺点错误估计得少，还表现在安于现状，不系统的总结经验，认真学习兄弟地区特别是各少数民族地区的经验很差。
    为此，代表大会指出，今后要充分发扬民主，经常开展批评与自我批评，要提倡独立思考，反对盲目服从，迅速加强党的团结，加强党的建设。
    这次代表大会讨论并批准了中共内蒙古自治区委员会的工作报告，选出了三十五名委员和十三名候补委员，组成新的中共内蒙古自治区委员会。同时选出了二十一名出席中共第八次全国代表大会的代表和两名候补代表。
    出席这次代表大会的有蒙古、汉、达呼尔、索伦、鄂伦春、朝鲜、回、满等民族的党员代表399人，代表着151，756名共产党员。
