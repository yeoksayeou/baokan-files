Minor Grains Cannot Be Reduced
Guizhou to Plant Extensively

(Our dispatch) The Guizhou Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party recently organized inspection teams to examine the current spring agricultural production. During the inspection, it was discovered that the sown area of minor grains had generally decreased in various regions. In Pingba County, Anshun Prefecture, the sown area of minor grains decreased by 30% to 50% compared to last year. In Duyun Prefecture, only three counties completed the soybean planting plan, with most counties only completing 30% to 40% of the plan. In response to this serious situation, the Guizhou Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party issued an emergency notice in early June, requiring all regions to actively expand the area of minor grains.

The notice emphasized that the reduction in the sown area of minor grains would not only affect the completion of the increased production plan and reduce the income of commune members, but would also affect the supply of minor grains to urban and rural people. Therefore, it is required that Party committees at all levels, based on the farming habits of farmers in previous years, seize the time to mobilize and organize members of agricultural cooperatives to utilize idle land such as field ridges, river banks, ditches, ponds, and dams, as well as the private plots, beside-house land, and vacant land near villages of commune members, to extensively replant minor grains.

In order to ensure the expansion of the sown area of minor grains, the instructions also require grain departments at all levels to supply seeds in a timely manner; at the same time, agricultural cooperatives can also mobilize members to mutually adjust a portion of minor grain seeds.

    小杂粮不能减少
    贵州将大量补种
    本报讯　中共贵州省委最近组织检查组，检查了当前的春耕生产。在检查中，发现了各地小杂粮的播种面积都普遍减少了。安顺专区的平坝县，小杂粮播种面积比去年减少了30％到50％。都匀专区只有三个县完成了大豆播种计划，多数县只完成计划的30％到40％。根据这一严重情况，中共贵州省委在六月上旬发出了要求各地积极扩大小杂粮面积的紧急通知。
    通知中强调指出，小杂粮播种面积的减少，不但会影响增产计划的完成，使社员收入减少，而且还会影响对城乡人民的杂粮供应。因此，要求各级党委根据农民往年的耕作习惯，抓紧时间，动员和组织农业合作社的社员，利用田坎、河堤、沟坎、塘坝等空地和社员的自留地、宅旁、村旁的隙地，大量补种小杂粮。
    为了保证扩大小杂粮的播种面积，指示中还要求各级粮食部门及时地供给种子；同时农业社还可以发动社员互相调剂出一部分小杂粮种子。
