    Local Newspaper Commentary
    Actively Explore the Potential of Steel Materials

    "Adopting a proactive attitude and exploring the potential of steel materials from multiple perspectives" is the call made by the Lüda Daily to the city's industrial production and capital construction departments in its June 30th editorial.

    The editorial pointed out: This year, due to the expansion of production, increased investment, and accelerated construction progress in both industrial production and capital construction departments, the supply of steel materials has become somewhat unable to meet demand.

    What attitude should we adopt to overcome this difficulty? The editorial stated: There are currently two different attitudes toward this difficulty. One is a proactive attitude, which many capital construction departments have adopted. Seeing that the supply of steel materials is very tight this year and that engineering tasks have increased, they quickly adopted many measures to conserve and substitute steel materials. Therefore, the shortage of steel in capital construction is not as severe as it was before. However, in contrast, some factories, knowing that the shortage of steel materials is a nationwide problem, are still passively waiting for the state to allocate them, without actively trying to overcome this difficulty.

    In fact, as long as we make an effort to overcome this difficulty with a proactive attitude, the tense situation of insufficient steel material supply can be greatly alleviated. Because after several years of the production increase and conservation campaign, workers in various factories have created many valuable experiences in conserving steel materials. Cold-drawn rebar, nesting tools, and exothermic risers are all good ways to save steel. If these experiences are systematically summarized and promoted, they will play a significant role in overcoming the difficulty of insufficient steel material supply. The editorial pointed out that some people only pay attention to collecting and utilizing waste materials, using inventory materials, and strengthening mutual adjustments between enterprises. However, they have not paid attention to a more important aspect, which is conservation in the production process. In fact, there is great potential to reduce the consumption of steel in production. To achieve this, the first thing to do is to focus on design work, fully adopt new technologies in the design, correctly and reasonably reduce the weight of products, and minimize machining allowances. Secondly, we must pay attention to the work of layout workers. Layout workers should ensure that large materials are not used for small purposes and that superior materials are not used for inferior purposes, and ensure that materials are laid out correctly according to the dimensions required by the drawings. In addition, improving product quality and reducing and eliminating defective products is another important aspect of saving steel in production.

    The editorial concluded by saying that saving steel materials is not just a matter for the material supply departments, but a common task for all employees. Every employee should adopt various methods to save steel, both by increasing sources and reducing waste, so that limited steel can play a greater role.

### 地方报纸的评论  积极挖掘钢铁材料的潜力

    地方报纸的评论
    积极挖掘钢铁材料的潜力
    “用积极主动的态度，从多方面挖掘钢铁材料的潜力”，这是旅大日报在六月三十日的社论中向全市工业生产部门和基本建设部门提出的号召。
    社论指出：今年由于工业生产部门和基本建设部门都纷纷扩大生产，追加投资，加快建设进度，钢铁材料的供应就有些不能满足需要了。
    用什么态度来克服这个困难呢？社论说：目前对待这一困难有两种不同的态度。一种是积极主动的态度，许多基本建设部门就是这样。他们看到今年钢铁材料供应情况很紧张，而工程任务又增加了，就迅速采取了许多节约和代用钢铁材料的措施，因此，目前基本建设中缺乏钢材的情况就不像以前那样紧张了。但是与此相反，有些工厂明知钢铁材料供应不足是全国性的问题，却仍然在那里消极等待国家给他们调拨，而没有主动想办法来克服这一困难。
    其实，只要是用积极主动的态度去努力克服这个困难，钢铁材料供应不足的紧张局面在很大程度上是可以得到缓和的。因为经过几年来的增产节约运动，各厂职工在节约钢铁材料方面创造了很多宝贵的经验。如冷拉钢筋、套料刀、加氧冒口等都是节约钢铁的好办法，如果系统地总结和推广这些经验，对克服钢铁材料供应不足的困难会起很大的作用。社论指出，有些人只注意了收集和利用废料、动用库存物资、加强各企业之间的互相调剂等工作。但是没有注意更重要的一个方面，就是在生产过程中的节约。实际上，减少生产中对钢铁的消耗，潜力是很大的。要做到这一点，首先要抓住设计工作，在设计中充分采用新技术，正确合理地减轻产品的体重，尽量减少加工余量。其次，要重视下料工人的工作。下料工人应该保证不大材小用和优材劣用，并且保证根据图纸要求的尺寸正确下料。此外，提高产品质量，减少和消灭废品也是在生产中节约钢铁的另一个重要方面。
    社论最后说，节约钢铁材料，不只是材料供应部门的事情，而是全体职工的共同任务。每个职工都应该采用各种办法来节约钢铁，既要开源，又要节流，以便使有限的钢铁能发挥更大的作用。
