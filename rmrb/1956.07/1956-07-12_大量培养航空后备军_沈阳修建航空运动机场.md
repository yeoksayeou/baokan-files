    Massively Cultivating Aviation Reserves
    Shenyang Builds Aviation Sports Airport
    (Our Dispatch) A large-scale aviation sports airport began construction in Shenyang in late June. The entire project covers an area of more than 2 million square meters and is divided into four parts: aviation models, gliding, parachuting, and flying. Among these four parts, the gliding airport is the largest, with an area of 1.1 million square meters. It is 1,300 meters long and 800 meters wide, with a cement runway of more than 1,000 meters and electrified flight control room equipment. There will be more than 60 small Yak-type aircraft and high-performance gliders here.
    This huge project will be completed by more than 140,000 workers, students, and officers and soldiers stationed in Shenyang through voluntary labor. On the day of commencement, more than 6,000 people participated in voluntary labor. At the commencement meeting, Shao Kai, Deputy Mayor of Shenyang, and Guo Kaifeng, representative of the troops stationed in Shenyang, spoke successively. Representatives participating in voluntary labor also made guarantees at the meeting, ensuring that the construction tasks would be completed according to plan. Currently, nearly a thousand people are participating in voluntary labor every day. After the airport is completed, it will enable the majority of workers to participate in national defense sports activities, thereby cultivating a large number of aviation reserves. (Li Dianxuan)

    大量培养航空后备军
    沈阳修建航空运动机场
    本报讯　一个规模巨大的航空运动机场，已于六月下旬在沈阳开工修建。这个工程全部面积有二百多万平方公尺，分为航空模型、滑翔、跳伞、飞行四个部分。在这四部分中，以滑翔机场的规模最大，面积有一百一十万平方公尺。长一千三百公尺，宽八百公尺，并有一千多公尺长的水泥跑道和电气化的飞行指挥室等设备。这里，将有六十多架小型雅克式飞机和性能良好的滑翔机。
    这一巨大工程，将由十四万多职工、学生和驻沈阳市官兵义务劳动完成。开工那天，参加义务劳动的就有六千多人。在开工大会上，沈阳市副市长邵凯和驻沈阳部队代表郭开锋都先后讲了话，参加义务劳动代表在会上也提出了保证，保证按计划完成施工任务。现在，每天都有近千人参加义务劳动。机场建成后，可以使广大职工参加国防体育活动，从而培养大量航空后备军。　（李殿选）
