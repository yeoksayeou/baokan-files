The current season is the tense season for rice field irrigation and drainage. In the Taihu Lake and Lixiahe rice-growing areas of Jiangsu Province, the sound of pumping electric motors can be heard everywhere. The huge water columns beautify the Jiangsu countryside like fountains.

Jiangsu Province has relatively well-developed machine-powered irrigation for farmland, with 5,386 existing pumps. This year, the province has newly built machine and electric irrigation projects, including 1,347 machines and 27,081 horsepower, shortening the rice transplanting period by about ten days compared to previous years. Farmers throughout the irrigation area no longer use manual water wheels. Most of the irrigation projects newly built this year are "publicly run with government assistance," and can irrigate 1,348,000 mu of farmland. Among them, the 6,700-horsepower electric irrigation project was built using the city's surplus electricity, and its irrigation area exceeds the total area of all electric irrigation built in the past six years, and is nearly double the total area of all electric irrigation before liberation.

    江苏农田电力灌溉发展
    现在正是稻田灌溉、排涝的紧张季节，江苏省的太湖和里下河水稻区，到处响起一片哒哒的抽水机电动马达声，巨大的水柱，像喷泉一样美化了江苏农村。
    江苏省农田机器电力灌溉比较发达，原有抽水机5，386台。今年全省又新建了包括1，347台、27，081马力的机器和电力灌溉工程，栽秧期比往年普遍缩短十天左右。整个灌溉区内的农民已不再使用人力车水了。今年新建的灌溉工程，大部分是“民办公助”的，可以灌溉一百三十四万八千亩农田。其中的六千七百马力的电力灌溉工程，是利用城市剩余的电力建成的，它的灌溉面积超过了六年来兴建的全部电力灌溉面积的总和，超过解放前全部电力灌溉面积近一倍。　（史）
