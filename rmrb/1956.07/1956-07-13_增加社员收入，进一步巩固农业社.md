Xinhua News Agency, Lin Yi, July 12th: Agricultural production cooperatives in the Lin Yi Special District of Shandong Province have been further consolidated and improved after the preliminary distribution of wheat.

The number of farmer households joining cooperatives in this special district has reached 92.3% of the total number of farmer households. This year, wheat has achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest. The total output of 6.24 million mu of winter wheat in the district has increased by 29% compared to last year; among 11,506 agricultural cooperatives, those with increased production compared to last year account for over 89.7%. According to statistics from Pingyi, Tancheng, and Yinan counties, where the preliminary distribution work was carried out earlier, the number of cooperative members whose wheat season income increased compared to last year accounts for 90.1% of the total.

The general increase in wheat season income has greatly encouraged the production enthusiasm of cooperative members and further consolidated agricultural cooperatives. According to surveys, the attendance rate of cooperative members in this special district has generally increased by more than 15% after the preliminary distribution of wheat. In the Gongnong Lianmeng Agricultural Cooperative in Chongbei Township, Tancheng County, 46 cooperative member households who originally had doubts and did not frequently participate in collective labor are now actively working because their income has increased after the preliminary distribution of wheat. During the preliminary distribution of wheat in Junan County, 94 cooperatives that originally had chaotic and unconsolidated members were consolidated.

During the wheat harvest, the increase in production in advanced cooperatives was more significant than in elementary cooperatives. Therefore, in Tancheng, Yinan, and Cangshan counties, 47 elementary cooperatives were automatically transformed into advanced cooperatives at the active request of their members during the preliminary distribution of wheat.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, July 11th: 71,534 mu of wheat in Zhenze County, Jiangsu Province, achieved a large-scale bumper harvest this year, with an average yield of 240 jin per mu, more than double the 114 jin per mu in 1955. During the summer preliminary distribution, 95% of cooperative members in the county increased their income.

The large-scale high-yield harvest of wheat in Zhenze County is due to the conscientious implementation of various production-increasing measures, the promotion of successful experiences such as wide-ridge close planting, timely topdressing, and timely emergency planting. At the same time, the Zhenze County Committee of the Communist Party of China conducted thorough organizational mobilization and ideological education work during the wheat sowing and wheat growth process.

During the sowing period, due to the promotion of close planting, difficulties arose with seeds. The Zhenze County Committee mobilized cooperatives and townships to adjust surpluses and deficiencies and support each other, while also requesting higher-level allocation of 300,000 jin of improved seeds. Insecticide machinery and materials such as ammonium superphosphate needed for topdressing were also prepared in advance. In terms of technical training, a large-scale cascading method was adopted. Before autumn planting, more than 1,600 technical backbones were trained. After returning to their cooperatives, the technical backbones promoted and taught techniques, ensuring that every cooperative and team had models, and that the technical measures of wide-ridge close planting and deep ditching and thorough cultivation were implemented throughout the county.

Wheat production increase measures greatly changed farmers' original habits, so farmers had many concerns. Therefore, the county party committee, in conjunction with the announcement of the draft National Agricultural Development Program, conducted training for all party members in the county. Through examples of high-yield harvests, they established party members' confidence in increasing production and criticized the timidity of some party members, calling on party members to take the lead in implementing various reform measures during sowing. Because ideological issues were resolved more thoroughly, party members actively acted after returning to their hometowns and cooperatives, actively solving the ideological concerns of the masses and many specific problems, so that various production-increasing measures could be implemented smoothly.

This Newspaper: The Laodong Agricultural Production Cooperative in Laodong Township, Jiaohe County, Jilin Province, is a national joint cooperative composed of Han and Korean farmers. This cooperative has formulated a plan for the development of agricultural and sideline production, and has quickly developed more than 100 hectares of paddy fields. Everyone believes that production can be increased this year. However, the Korean cooperative members, who originally operated more paddy fields, still had a relatively reduced area of paddy fields per laborer, and the income of these members will be reduced.

In order to ensure that the Korean cooperative members who originally operated paddy fields can also increase their income, the Laodong Agricultural Cooperative came up with a way to fully utilize the technical expertise of Korean farmers and try to meet their requirements for more labor. This will enable their actual income to increase compared to last year. For cooperative members with less labor and the old and weak, they are arranged to do some appropriate sideline work, and preparations are being made to buy seventy piglets for the old and weak cooperative members to raise.

This Newspaper: During the spring plowing season, four agricultural production cooperatives in Dong Sanjia and Sijianfang in Yanwuji Township, Yilan County, Heilongjiang Province, abandoned 170 hectares of mature land without sowing. Some of this land was planned to be converted into paddy fields, but because the dyke breached and there was a shortage of water, rice was not planted; another part was abandoned because the cooperative's agricultural work was not well arranged. Many cooperative members believe that it is too late in the season now, and replanting this land will definitely result in low yields and will not be cost-effective.

The county chief, who was inspecting work in the village, inspected these wastelands together with the cooperative members. Everyone unanimously agreed that if buckwheat, thin porridge millet and other late crops are planted in these fields now, or some crops are replanted by means of seedling transplantation, at least 3,000 jin of grain can be harvested per hectare in the autumn, and each cooperative can harvest more than 130,000 to 140,000 jin of grain. After inspection, each cooperative put forward the slogan of "no wasteland shall be left uncultivated" and extracted a total of 150 to 160 laborers to rush to plant late crops.

    增加社员收入，进一步巩固农业社
    90％社员比去年多分小麦
    新华社临沂12日电　山东省临沂专区的农业生产合作社，在小麦预分后得到了进一步的巩固和提高。
    这个专区入社农户已占总农户92.3％，今年小麦得到了空前的丰收，全区六百二十四万亩冬小麦的总产量比去年增加了29％；一万一千五百零六个农业社中，比去年增产的占89.7％强。据预分工作进行较早的平邑、郯城、沂南等三个县统计，今年麦季收入比去年增加的社员占总数的90.1％。
    麦季收入的普遍增加，大大的鼓舞了社员们的生产热情，和使农业社得到了进一步的巩固。据调查，这个专区农业社的社员出勤率，在小麦预分后普遍提高了15％以上。郯城县重北乡工农联盟农业社原来思想上还有疑虑、不经常参加集体劳动的四十六户社员，小麦预分后因为增加了收入，现在也积极劳动了。莒南县在小麦预分过程中，有九十四个原来社员思想混乱、不很巩固的社得到了巩固。
    在麦收中，高级社的增产比初级社更为显著，因此，郯城、沂南、苍山等三个县，在小麦预分中还有四十七个初级社在社员们的积极要求下，自动的转成了高级社。
    全县95％社员增加收入
    新华社南京11日电　江苏省震泽县71，534亩小麦，今年获得大面积丰产，平均每亩产量240斤，比1955年每亩114斤增产一倍多。全县农业社在夏季预分中有95％的社员增加了收入。
    震泽县小麦获得大面积高额丰产是由于认真贯彻了各项增产措施，推广了阔埨密植、适时追肥和及时抢种等成功经验，同时，中共震泽县委在小麦播种和小麦生长过程中深入地进行了组织动员和思想教育工作。
    在播种期间，由于推广密植，种子发生了困难，震泽县委就一面动员社与社、乡与乡进行有无调剂，互相支持，一面请上级调拨了30万斤良种。治虫药械、追肥所需肥田粉等物资，也都在事前作了准备。在技术训练方面，大规模地采用了连环带动的办法。在秋种以前，训练了1，600余名技术骨干，技术骨干回社后，一面宣传一面传授，做到了社社有样子，队队有样子，层层扩大，保证了在全县范围内贯彻阔埨密植、深沟透耕的技术措施。
    小麦增产措施对农民原有习惯改变很大，因此农民顾虑很多。于是县委就结合全国农业发展纲要草案的宣布，对全县党员进行了一次训练，通过丰产实例，树立党员的增产信心，并批判了某些党员的畏难情绪，号召党员在播种中带头贯彻各项改革措施。由于思想解决得比较深透，党员在回乡回社后都积极行动，主动解决了群众思想顾虑和许多具体问题，使各项增产措施得以顺利贯彻。
    让社员的收入越来越多
    本报讯　吉林省蛟河县劳动乡劳动农业生产合作社，是汉族和朝鲜族农民联合组成的民族联合社。这个合作社制定了发展农、副业生产的计划，很快地开发了一百多公顷水田，大家都相信今年能够增产。但是，原来经营水田较多的朝鲜族社员，每个劳动力所负担的水田面积还是相对地减少了，这些社员的收入将会降低。
    劳动农业社为了保证原来经营水田的朝鲜族社员也能增加收入，想出了充分发挥朝鲜族农民技术特长的办法，尽量满足他们多劳动的要求。这样就可以使他们的实际收入比去年增加。对劳动力少的和老弱的社员，安排他们做一些适当的副业活，同时准备买七十口小猪给老弱社员喂养。　（林乐耕）
    荒弃的田还能播种
    本报讯　黑龙江省依兰县演武基乡东三家、四间房等四个农业生产合作社，在春耕期间丢下了170公顷熟地没有播种。这些地，一部分是准备改为水田的，因为溃堤缺水没种上水稻；另一部分是合作社农活安排不好丢下的。许多社员认为：现在季节已晚，再种这些地，产量一定低，不合算。
    在这个村检查工作的县长同社员们一起查看了这些荒地，大家一致认为，如果现在在这些地里种上荞麦、稀饭谷等晚庄稼，或用移苗的办法补栽一些庄稼，到秋天每公顷地至少可收三千斤粮食，每个社就能多收十三、四万斤粮食。经过检查，各个社提出了“不荒一亩地”的口号，一共抽出了一百五、六十个劳动力抢种晚庄稼。
