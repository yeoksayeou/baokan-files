Xinhua News Agency Report: Zhejiang Province's agricultural (tea) production cooperatives and state-owned tea farms have achieved abundant summer tea harvests. The Zhejiang Provincial Company of the China Tea Company has already purchased over 120,000 dan of summer tea in various locations, exceeding the total amount of summer tea purchased throughout the entire year last year by more than 18,000 dan.

The quality of this year's summer tea has also improved. The Xianlin purchasing station in Yu Hang County, which only purchased over ten dan of Grade One summer tea last year, has already purchased over one hundred dan this year.

The abundant summer tea harvest in Zhejiang Province is primarily due to the tea-growing farmers, after cooperativization, strengthening the cultivation and management of tea trees. The chemical fertilizers provided by the state to support farmers in increasing summer tea production were promptly transported to various locations for application. Furthermore, the practice of leaving residual leaves for picking has been further promoted in various regions.

    浙江夏茶丰收
    据新华社讯　浙江省农（茶）业生产合作社和国营茶场的夏茶都获得丰收。中国茶叶公司浙江省公司在各地已采购了十二万多担夏茶，比去年全年采购的夏茶数量还多一万八千多担。
    今年夏茶的质量也有提高。去年夏茶一级茶只收购了十多担的余杭县闲林收购站，今年已经收购到一百多担。
    浙江省夏茶丰收的原因，主要是合作化后的茶区农民，加强了对茶树的培育管理工作。国家支持农民增产夏茶的化学肥料，及时运到各地施用。各地又进一步推广了留余叶的采摘方法。
