Electroacupuncture Therapy Shows Remarkable Effects
Golden Needle Electrotherapy Machines to be Supplied Nationwide

(Our Dispatch from Hangzhou) The Hangzhou Municipal Traditional Chinese Medicine Clinic and a certain sanatorium of the People's Liberation Army have achieved remarkable results by using electroacupuncture to treat various diseases such as hypertension, neurasthenia, neurosis, rheumatoid arthritis, and traumatic pain. From last year to the present, statistics based on 400 cases show an effectiveness rate of over 90%. In particular, stubborn chronic diseases of the nervous system respond very well.

Electroacupuncture therapy is a new medical method that combines acupuncture and electrotherapy. It uses metal needles inserted into the nerve acupoints of the human body, using the needles as circuits to allow current to pass through the nerves for conduction and diffusion, achieving the therapeutic requirements. The advantages of electroacupuncture therapy are the long "needle retention" time and the ability to control a certain amount of stimulation with the aid of electricity. The disease responds quickly and can not only treat diseases of the acupoints, but also diseases outside the acupoints. For example, rheumatism and neurasthenia, indigestion and hypertension can achieve dual improvement after electroacupuncture stimulation at the same nerve acupoint. Electroacupuncture therapy can also simplify the more than 360 acupoints prescribed in acupuncture to about 30, and the treatment schedule can also be relatively shortened. The amount of electricity output by the Golden Needle Electrotherapy Machine is very small, only less than one milliampere. According to clinical trials of more than 4,000 person-times in more than 400 patients, the patients did not experience any discomfort, and it did not have any adverse effects on human physiological functions.

In electroacupuncture treatment, Gao Jiye, a traditional Chinese medicine physician at the Hangzhou Municipal Traditional Chinese Medicine Clinic, and Li Shiyi and Wang Jie, military doctors at a certain sanatorium of the People's Liberation Army, designed a Golden Needle Electrotherapy Machine based on the clinical experience of the past year, using current based on induction electricity. This electrotherapy machine has improved on the power supply conversion, regulation control, and multi-bed connection compared with the three-bed induction electroacupuncture machine used last year. Relevant technical personnel from the China Pharmaceutical Company Shanghai Purchasing and Supply Station Medical Equipment Industry Company have studied the blueprint of the designed Golden Needle Electrotherapy Machine, and they plan to manufacture a batch this year to supply medical departments across the country.

    电针疗法效果显著
    金针电疗机将供应全国
    本报讯　杭州市中医门诊部和解放军某疗养院采用电针治疗高血压、神经衰弱、神经官能症、类风湿症和外伤性疼痛等各类疾病收到显著效果。自去年至今，以四百个病例统计，有效率达90％以上，特别是神经系统顽固性的慢性疾病，更能收到较好的效果。
    电针疗法，是针灸和电疗相结合的一种新的医疗方法。它是用金属的针刺入人体组织的神经穴位，以针作为电路，使电流通过神经的传导和扩散，达到治疗要求；电针疗法的好处是“留针”时间长，有电力的辅助能掌握一定的刺激量，疾病见效快、同时不但能达到治疗针刺穴位的疾病，还能治好穴位以外的疾病。例如风湿症和神经衰弱、消化不良和高血压能在同一神经穴位电针刺激后，获得双重进步。电针疗法还可从针灸学上规定三百六十多个针灸的穴位简化为三十多个左右，治疗的日程也可以相对地缩短。金针电疗机输出的电量很微，仅低于一毫安，据四百多个病人四千多人次的临床试用证明，病人没有不舒适的感觉，对人体生理机能也无任何坏处。
    在电针治疗中，杭州市中医门诊部中医师高继业和解放军某疗养院军医李诗宜、王杰根据一年来的临床体会选用了以感应电为主的电流设计了一种金针电疗机。这种电疗机对电源转换、调节控制、多床联用等方面都比去年用的三床联用的感应电针机有了改进。中国医药公司上海采购供应站医疗器械工业公司有关的技术人员对设计的金针电疗机蓝图进行了研究，他们准备在今年内制造一批供应全国各地医疗部门。　（本报驻杭州记者）
