Xinhua News Agency, 12th: By mid-June, agricultural loans totaling over 1.78 billion yuan had been issued to farmers nationwide. This figure is four times that of the same period last year.

Of these loans, over 590 million yuan were from the Poverty-Stricken Peasant Cooperative Fund, with the remainder being basic construction and production expense loans issued to agricultural production cooperatives.

Because agricultural loans were issued promptly in various regions, they resolved the difficulty of paying cooperative membership shares for approximately 40 million impoverished peasant households; at the same time, these loans played a significant role in supporting farmers in constructing water conservancy projects and purchasing means of production.

Xinhua News Agency, 11th: The All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives and the Ministry of Agriculture have decided to allocate over 44,000 tons of chemical fertilizer from the annual plan to support key cotton-growing areas and some flood-affected regions. This chemical fertilizer mainly consists of superphosphate and ammonium sulfate.

Currently, over 14,000 tons of superphosphate have already been allocated to Anhui, Hebei, Shandong, Henan, Jiangsu, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Shanghai, and other regions; the remainder is being actively organized for transport. Superphosphate can be used for foliar fertilization in cotton fields, and cotton fields sprayed with phosphate can increase production by an average of approximately 13% per mu. Ammonium sulfate is a quick-acting fertilizer, and its application can promote crop growth in a very short time, making it particularly useful for late-planted crops.

    全国发放农贷十七亿元
    四万多吨化学肥料调往支援棉区和涝区
    新华社12日讯　到六月中旬止，全国各地发放到农民手中的农业贷款已达十七亿八千多万元。这个数字相当于去年同期的四倍。
    这些贷款中，贫农合作基金占五亿九千多万元，其余都是发放给农业生产合作社的基本建设和生产费用贷款。
    由于各地农业贷款发放得都很及时，大约给四千多万户贫困农民解决了缴纳入社股金的困难；同时这些贷款在支持农民兴修水利、购买生产资料等方面都起了很大作用。
    新华社11日讯　全国供销合作总社和农业部决定调拨年度计划内的四万四千多吨化学肥料支援重点棉区和部分受水涝地区。这些化学肥料主要是过磷酸钙和硫酸铵。
    现在已经有一万四千多吨过磷酸钙调往安徽、河北、山东、河南、江苏、山西、陕西、上海等地；其余正在积极组织调运。过磷酸钙可作棉田根外施肥之用，喷磷的棉田平均每亩可以增产13％左右。硫酸铵是一种速效肥料，施用后在很短的时间内就能促使作物生长，对晚种作物特别有用。
