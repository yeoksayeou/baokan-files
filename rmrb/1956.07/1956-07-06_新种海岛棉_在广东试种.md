Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, July 5th. Yangjiang County and Dongfang County in Guangdong Province have recently established two sea island cotton trial planting stations. These two trial planting stations, along with some state-owned reclamation farms and agricultural producers' cooperatives, have planted approximately 1,500 mu of sea island cotton. These sea island cotton plants can provide some seeds for future expansion of sea island cotton planting.

According to the current plan, Guangdong Province will plant 200,000 mu of sea island cotton within six years.

Sea island cotton is a subtropical perennial crop with long, fine fibers and strong tensile strength, suitable for spinning high-grade cotton yarn. It can be planted in the southern areas of Guangdong Province, and from the year after planting, flowers can be harvested twice annually.

    新种海岛棉
    在广东试种
    新华社广州5日电　广东省阳江县和东方县最近设立了两个海岛棉试种站，这两个试种站和一些国营垦殖场以及农业生产合作社，已经分别种植了约一千五百亩海岛棉。这些海岛棉可为今后扩大种植海岛棉提供一部分种籽。
    根据现定的计划，在六年内，广东省将种植海岛棉二十万亩。
    海岛棉是亚热带的多年生作物，纤维细长，拉力很强，可纺高级棉纱；在广东省南部地带都可种植，从种后的次年起，便可逐年收花两次。
