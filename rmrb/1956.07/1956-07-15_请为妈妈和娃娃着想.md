    Please Think of Mothers and Children

    In our Guangxi Daily office, there are over a hundred children who have not reached school age. However, there is no nursery. The children are all left at home to be taken care of by nannies. Because nannies cannot educate the children well, the children have developed bad habits such as quarreling, fighting, and being unhygienic. Some female comrades also have trouble managing because they have many children and one nanny cannot take care of them all, which often affects their work and study. Therefore, I suggest that the leaders of the Guangxi Daily consider the work and study of female comrades, and for the sake of better educating children, establish a nursery as soon as possible.

    请为妈妈和娃娃着想
    我们广西日报社未达学龄的儿童已有一百多，但还没有托儿所，只有把孩子们都留在家中请保姆带。由于保姆不能很好的教育孩子，使孩子养成了吵嘴、打架、不讲卫生等等坏习惯。也有些女同志因为孩子多，一个保姆照顾不过来，经常影响自己的工作和学习。因此，我建议广西日报社领导上，为女同志的工作学习着想，为更好地教育儿童着想，尽快建立托儿所。（素　文）
