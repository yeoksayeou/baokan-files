    "Raid" at Dawn

    The Beijing Waste Products Management Office of the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives was within the scope of urban planning demolition, and could not move out for the time being due to the lack of relocation sites. However, while waiting for the higher authorities to resolve the issue, the Xidan Demolition Team of Beijing Municipality launched a "surprise attack." On June 24th, a Sunday, at 7:15 in the morning, the comrades of the Waste Products Management Office were still asleep when suddenly, bang! bang! crash! crash! rumble! sounds were deafening. Then bricks and tiles flew, and dust filled the air. The people in the house, drowsy and unaware of what was happening, thought some catastrophe was befalling them, and were immediately thrown into chaos. Some people ran out without even putting on their clothes.

    Of course, the task of the demolition team is to "demolish," but by its very definition, it should be "relocate" and then "demolish." Why use the method of "demolition" to force people to "relocate" when they have nowhere to move to?

    黎明时的“突袭”
    全国供销合作总社北京废品经营处的房子在都市规划拆迁范围以内，因为没有移居的地方，一时无法迁出。但在静待上级解决期间，北京市西单拆迁组却来了个“突然袭击”，六月二十四日，这天是星期天，早晨七点十五分，废品经营处的同志还晨睡未醒，忽然屋顶上砰！砰！澎！澎！轰隆之声，不绝于耳，接着砖瓦齐飞，灰尘遍扬，房子里的人睡意蒙胧，真相不明，以为是什么大祸临头，登时乱作一团，有的人连衣服也没穿就跑了出来。
    当然，拆迁组的任务就是“拆”，但顾名思义，也应该“迁”而后“拆”，为什么当人家还无地可迁的时候，就用“拆”的办法强迫人家“迁”呢？
