Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou Telegram: The Tianzhu Tibetan Autonomous County in Gansu Province has begun to erect telephone lines to all grasslands in the county. The entire project will be completed by the end of September this year.

　　Tianzhu Tibetan Autonomous County is located in the Qilian Mountains of Gansu Province. The county is five hundred li long from east to west and one hundred and twenty li wide. The construction of this telephone line network requires traversing many deep mountain canyons, large grasslands and forest areas, and also crossing many high mountains and ridges with elevations of three to four thousand meters above sea level, making the project very arduous. After this telephone line network is completed, the connection between the city and the grasslands of the autonomous county will be facilitated.

    草原上架设电话线
    新华社兰州电　甘肃省天祝藏族自治县开始架设通往全县各个草原的电话线网。全部工程将在今年九月底完成。
    天祝藏族自治县位于甘肃省祁连山中，全县东西长五百里，宽一百二十里。架设这个电话线网要穿越许多深山峡谷、大片草原和森林地带，还要跨过许多拔海三千到四千公尺以上的高山峻岭，工程十分艰巨。这个电话线网架成以后，自治县的城市和草原之间的联系就方便了。
