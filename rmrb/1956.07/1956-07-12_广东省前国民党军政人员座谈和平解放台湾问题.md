Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, July 9th: More than seventy former Kuomintang military and political personnel working in various departments and agencies of the Guangdong Province and Guangzhou City People's Committee held a forum, hoping that Kuomintang military and political personnel in Taiwan and overseas will work hard to promote the peaceful liberation of Taiwan and return to the embrace of the motherland as soon as possible to perform meritorious service.

Ding Jixu, former commander of the First Route Pursuit of the Kuomintang Guangdong Air Force and now a member of the Guangzhou Municipal Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, said: Premier Zhou’s speech shows that the door of the motherland is open. If the Kuomintang military and political personnel who fled to Taiwan appreciate the pain of living under someone else's roof and consider the motherland and themselves, I believe they will contribute to the peaceful liberation of Taiwan.

He Baosong, former major general and commander of the Kuomintang 157th Division and current deputy director of the Guangdong Provincial Department of Civil Affairs, said: As a general who revolted, after reading Premier Zhou’s speech, I deeply feel that everything the Communist Party does is focused on the interests of the motherland, the nation, and the broad masses of the people, without any personal grievances. The Kuomintang military and political personnel in Taiwan should quickly and kindly consider their future and choose the best path they should take.

Huang Tao, a standing committee member of the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and former commander of the Kuomintang 62nd Army, said: I especially hope that the Guangdong generals in Taiwan will wake up as soon as possible, take the lead in responding to Premier Zhou’s call, and make their own patriotic actions as soon as possible to complete the unification of the motherland.

    广东省前国民党军政人员座谈和平解放台湾问题
    据新华社广州9日电　在广东省和广州市人民委员会各部门和各机关工作的七十多位前国民党军政人员举行座谈，希望在台湾和海外的国民党军政人员努力促进台湾的和平解放，及早立功回到祖国的怀抱里来。
    前国民党广东空军第一路驱逐司令、现任政协广州市委员会委员丁纪徐说：周总理的发言说明祖国的大门是敞开着的。跑到台湾去的国民党军政人员如果体会到寄人篱下的痛苦以及考虑到祖国和自己的话，我相信一定会为实现和平解放台湾而作出贡献。
    前国民党第一五七师少将师长、现任广东省民政厅副厅长何宝松说：作为一个起义将领，我读了周总理的发言以后，深感共产党的一切作为都是以祖国、民族和广大人民的利益为重，没有一党的私怨。在台湾的国民党军政人员对自己的前途应该迅速从善考虑，选择自己应走的上策的道路。
    政协广东省委员会常务委员、过去曾任国民党第六十二军军长的黄涛说：我特别希望在台湾的广东将领们及早有所醒悟，首先起来响应周总理的号召，为完成祖国的统一事业而及早作出自己的爱国行动来。
