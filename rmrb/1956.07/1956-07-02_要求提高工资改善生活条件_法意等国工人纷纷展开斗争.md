Xinhua News Agency, Paris dispatch from TASS: French newspapers report that workers in some industries in France are launching struggles to demand higher wages. Construction workers in the Paris region held a short strike on the 28th, demanding that employers resume negotiations with the union on increasing wages and concluding collective contracts. Between 30,000 and 50,000 workers participated in the strike. Miners in all coal regions of France also held a day of struggle on the 28th to strive for improving their material conditions. Miners in all coal mines have raised demands for wage increases.

In the "Renault" automobile factory, the three union organizations affiliated with the General Confederation of Labor, the "Workers' Force" General Confederation of Labor, and the "French Confederation of Christian Workers," along with other union organizations, have jointly called on workers to hold a short strike, demanding general wage increases and increased bonuses for completing plans.

The Administrative Committee of the French General Confederation of Labor issued a communiqué stating that since December 1955, the cost of living in France has increased by an average of 10%. The Administrative Committee draws the attention of all union organizations to the necessity of organizing French workers and working people to conduct a united struggle to win satisfaction for their legitimate demands.

Rome, 29th dispatch: Italian agricultural workers across the country held a 24-hour strike yesterday to protest against farm owners' refusal to increase their wages and improve care for sick and unemployed agricultural workers. The three major agricultural workers' unions led by the Communist Party, the Christian Democratic Party, and the Social Democratic Party all supported the strike.

Reports say that in twenty provinces in the northeastern agricultural region of Italy, striking workers continued their strike after holding a 24-hour strike. The workers stated that they would persist in this strike indefinitely unless their demands are met.

London, 1st dispatch: Three thousand workers at the British Motor Corporation went on strike on June 29th to protest the company's decision to lay off six thousand workers.

The layoffs were caused by the slump in the automobile industry. Reports say that since January of this year, 90,000 workers in the automobile industry have been affected by layoffs and reduced working hours.

The vast number of laborers facing the threat of unemployment are brewing a large-scale strike. Union representatives at the Austin Motor Company in Birmingham passed a resolution at a meeting on June 28th, calling on British auto workers to hold a solidarity strike.

Agence France-Presse reports: "Labor unrest is spreading like wildfire to all mechanical industry sectors." In addition to opposing layoffs, workers are also urgently demanding wage increases to cope with the rapid increase in prices. However, the capitalists refused the workers' demands. They said, do not imagine increasing wages within this year.

British industry insiders predict that the strike movement may soon spread to all nationalized industrial sectors.

Lima, 28th dispatch: A nationwide strike by 100,000 workers has paralyzed major enterprises throughout Peru on the 27th.

This general strike was triggered by the International Petroleum Company, which is related to the American Mobil Oil Company, refusing to increase wages for employees. A sympathy strike first broke out in the Peruvian capital Lima and the nearby large port of Callao on the 26th. Students in these two places also went on strike at the same time to protest against the increase in fares.

The President of Peru declared a "state of emergency" for thirty days on the 26th and ordered the police and army to take "strict measures" against the striking workers. On the 26th, demonstrating workers and students clashed with the police, and the number of deaths and injuries reached sixty.

Santiago dispatch: Eight thousand nitrate miners went on strike on the 25th, demanding wage increases.

They are workers of the American Anglo-Lautaro Nitrate Company, and their current wages are lower than those of copper miners.

    要求提高工资改善生活条件
    法意等国工人纷纷展开斗争
    法国
    新华社据塔斯社巴黎讯  法国报纸消息，法国一些行业的工人正在展开要求提高工资的斗争。巴黎区的建筑企业工人二十八日举行短时间罢工，要求企业主同工会恢复关于增加工资和缔结集体合同的谈判。参加罢工的工人有三万到五万。法国各煤区的矿工二十八日也举行了争取改善他们的物质状况的斗争日。所有煤矿的矿工都提出了增加工资的要求。
    在“雷诺”汽车工厂中，分别隶属总工会、“工人力量”总工会和“法国天主教劳工联盟”的三个工会组织和其他工会组织，已经联合号召工人们举行短期罢工，要求普遍增加工资和提高完成计划的奖金。
    法国总工会行政委员会发表公报说，从1955年12月起，法国的生活费用平均提高了10％。行政委员会提请一切工会组织注意：有必要组织法国工人和劳动人民进行一致的斗争，以争取满足自己合法的要求。
    意大利
    新华社29日讯　罗马消息：意大利全国范围的农业工人昨天举行二十四小时罢工，抗议农场主拒绝提高他们的工资和改善对生病、失业的农业工人的照顾。分别由共产党、天主教民主党及社会民主党领导的三大农业工人工会都支持这次罢工。
    消息说，在意大利东北农业地区的二十个省份中，罢工工人在举行二十四小时罢工后，继续罢工。工人们表示，除非他们的要求得到满足，他们将无限期地坚持这一罢工。
    英国
    新华社1日讯　伦敦消息：英国汽车公司的三千工人在六月二十九日罢工，抗议这家公司解雇六千名工人的决定。
    解雇工人是由汽车工业的不景气引起的。有消息说：自从今年一月以来，汽车工业中已经有九万工人受到解雇和缩短工时的影响。
    面临失业威胁的广大劳工在酝酿大规模罢工。伯明翰的奥斯汀汽车公司工会代表在六月二十八日的会议上通过决议，呼吁英国汽车工人举行同盟罢工。
    法新社消息说：“劳工骚动像野火一般在蔓延到所有的机械工业部门。”除了反对解雇以外，工人们还迫切要求增加工资，以适应物价的飞速增涨。但是资方拒绝工人们的要求。他们说，不要设想在今年以内增加工资。
    英国工业界人士预料，罢工运动不久可能蔓延到所有国有化的工业部门。
    秘鲁
    据新华社28日讯　利马消息：十万名工人的全国性的大罢工使得秘鲁全国的主要企业在二十七日都陷于瘫痪。
    这次大罢工是由于同美国美孚油公司有关系的国际石油公司拒绝增加职工工资引起的，同情罢工二十六日在秘鲁首都利马和附近的大港口卡拉俄城首先爆发。这两个地方的学生为了反对增加车费，也在同时举行了罢课。
    秘鲁总统在二十六日宣布全国进入“紧急状态”三十天，并且命令警察和军队采取“严厉措施”对付罢工工人。在二十六日这一天，示威的工人和学生同警察发生了冲突，死伤的人数达到六十人。
