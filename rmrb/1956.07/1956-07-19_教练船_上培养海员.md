Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan. The Yangtze River Navigation Administration is using a "training ship" as a classroom to train Sichuan River pilots and deck officers. The first training ship, the "Minzhi," has accepted its first group of fifty Sichuan River seamen since May to study pilotage and helmsman techniques. After fifty days of study on board and more than ten days of on-site examinations and written tests, these fifty people graduated on the 8th of this month. Examination results prove that the trainees' academic performance was good. The level of learning they achieved would have taken six months to a year using ordinary training methods.

The Sichuan River channel is winding and narrow, with many shoals and rapid currents, making it difficult for seamen to learn the piloting techniques here in ordinary classrooms. After adopting the method of on-site observation, explanation, and practice, the time it takes for an ordinary Sichuan River helmsman to advance to a senior pilot can be shortened by nearly half.

    “教练船”上培养海员
    据新华社武汉讯　长江航运管理局用“教练船”作课堂培养川江引水和驾驶人员。第一艘教练船“民治号”，自五月起就接纳了第一批前来学习引水和舵工技术的川江海员五十人。这五十人在船上经过五十天学习，并且经过十多天的现场考试和笔试以后，已经在本月八日结业。考试结果证明，学员的学习成绩良好。他们所达到的学习成绩，如果用普通的方法培养，需要半年到一年的时间。
    川江航道弯曲狭窄，滩多流急，海员们在普通的课堂上很难学会这里的驾引技术。采取在现场边看、边讲、边实习的办法以后，一个川江普通舵工提升到大引水的时间，可以缩短将近一半。
