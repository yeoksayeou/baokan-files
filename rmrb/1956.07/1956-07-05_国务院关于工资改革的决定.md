    The State Council's Decision on Wage Reform
    (Adopted at the 32nd Plenary Session of the State Council on June 16, 1956)
    I. In recent years, the government, adhering to the policy of gradually improving the living standards of workers and staff on the basis of developing production and increasing labor productivity, has significantly raised the wage levels of workers and staff. At the same time, one or more wage reforms have been carried out by region and department, and a wage system based on the principle of "to each according to his work" has been preliminarily established. This has played a positive role in encouraging workers and staff to improve their professional and technical skills, increase labor productivity and work efficiency, and promote the recovery and development of the national economy. However, there have been imbalances in wage increases between years. The increases were faster before 1953, while in 1954 and 1955, the average wage increase for workers and staff in industrial, capital construction, and transportation departments was slower due to the failure to adjust wage standards, the abolition of some unreasonable bonus and subsidy systems without the timely establishment of reasonable bonus and subsidy systems, overly tight control over promotions, and the phenomenon of work stoppages and idleness in some enterprises and construction units. This slower increase was not commensurate with the increase in labor productivity, and coupled with some price increases in non-staple foods, the actual wages of some workers and staff even decreased. This is a serious shortcoming of the government's wage work. In past wage reforms, the unreasonable factors left over from the old wage system have not been completely overcome, and some new problems have arisen with the rapid development and changes in the national economy. As a result, there are still many phenomena in the current wage system that do not conform to the principle of "to each according to his work" and the needs of production development, especially the quite serious phenomenon of egalitarianism. This situation must be vigorously overcome.
    At present, the nationwide upsurge of workers and staff building socialism is constantly rising. In order to better encourage workers and staff to improve their professional and technical skills, consolidate and enhance their work enthusiasm, further promote the advanced producer movement, increase labor productivity, and complete and overfulfill the state's first Five-Year Plan, the State Council now decides to appropriately raise wage levels and, under this condition, further reform the wage system of enterprises (including state-owned enterprises, supply and marketing cooperative enterprises, joint state-private enterprises before full industry-wide public-private partnership), institutions, and state organs, according to the principle of "to each according to his work." All enterprises, institutions, and state organs undergoing this wage reform shall implement the new wage standards from April 1, 1956.
    II. Based on the development of national industry and agriculture and the current political and economic tasks, and based on the principle that the increase in workers and staff wages must be commensurate with the increase in labor productivity, and that the rate of increase in labor productivity must exceed the rate of increase in wages, it is determined that the average wage of workers and staff in enterprises, institutions, and state organs will increase by 14.5% in 1956 (approximately 13% if including newly added personnel in 1956). According to the principle of "to each according to his work," the state's industrialization policy, and the current wage situation, in this wage reform, wages should be increased more for heavy industry departments, key construction areas, senior skilled workers, and senior scientific and technical personnel; wages should also be increased more for primary school teachers, supply and marketing cooperative staff, and township cadres who currently have relatively low wage standards; at the same time, wages in coastal cities and some units in other regions with relatively high current wage levels should also generally be slightly increased.
    III. In this wage reform, the following measures should be adopted and implemented:
    1. Abolish the wage point system and price subsidy system, and implement a system of directly specifying wage standards in currency, in order to eliminate the unreasonable phenomena brought to the wage system by wage points and price subsidies, and to simplify wage calculation procedures, so as to facilitate the implementation of economic accounting systems by enterprises. Different currency wage standards should be stipulated according to the needs of production development in each region, price living standards, and the actual wage situation. In regions with high prices, in order to avoid excessively high wage standards, the method of adding a cost-of-living allowance in addition to the wage standard can be adopted. The cost-of-living allowance should be adjusted with price adjustments.
    2. Improve the wage grade system for workers, so that there are more obvious differences in wage standards between skilled and unskilled labor, heavy and light labor. Appropriately widen the difference in wage standards between high-grade and low-grade workers; ensure that the wage standards for workers in high-temperature jobs are higher than those for workers in normal-temperature jobs, the wage standards for underground workers are higher than those for above-ground workers, and the piece-rate wage standards are higher than the time-rate wage standards, in order to overcome the phenomenon of egalitarianism in wage treatment. At the same time, in order to make the worker wage grade system more reasonable, each industrial sector must formulate and revise worker technical grade standards according to actual conditions, and strictly conduct skill assessment and promotion according to technical grade standards, so that promotion becomes a normal system.
    3. Improve the wage system for enterprise staff and technical personnel. The wage standards for enterprise staff and technical personnel should be uniformly stipulated according to the positions they hold. The wages for each position can be divided into several grades, and the wage grade lines for higher and lower positions can overlap. For technical personnel, in addition to assessing wages according to the positions they hold, technical allowances should be added for those with higher technical levels; specific allowances should be added for senior technical personnel who have made important contributions to the enterprise, so as to ensure that their wage income increases more. For some senior technical personnel whose current wage standards are higher than the newly set position wage standards, wages can be stipulated separately for them, so that their wages still increase. For engineering and technical personnel in some regions and some industries, if it is currently difficult to uniformly stipulate wage standards according to positions, wage standards for technical personnel can be stipulated separately, but attention must be paid to appropriately balancing the wage levels with those of similar technical personnel who implement position-based wages, and the difference cannot be too large.
    For senior scientific and technical personnel and other senior intellectuals in institutions and state organs who have made important contributions, in addition to paying wages according to their wage standards, specific allowances should also be added.
    4. Promote and improve the piece-rate wage system. Each industry should formulate practical plans for promoting the piece-rate wage system and uniform piece-rate wage procedures. All work that can be done on a piece-rate basis should be implemented fully or mostly with the piece-rate wage system in 1957. At the same time, a system of regularly (generally annually) reviewing and revising quotas must be established and improved to ensure that the quotas have a technical basis and a relatively advanced level. When implementing piece-rate wage standards, they should be gradually increased from low to high, and outdated quotas must be revised at the same time.
    5. Improve the enterprise bonus wage system. Each competent department should formulate uniform bonus methods according to the needs of production, and actively establish and improve bonus systems for new product trial production, saving raw materials, saving fuel or electricity, improving product quality, and overfulfilling tasks.
    6. Improve the subsidy system. Review existing subsidy methods, overcome the current confusion in subsidies, and establish and improve subsidy systems necessary for production. Each department and region should submit plans for improving the subsidy system within their scope of management in 1956, and report to the State Council for approval and implementation.
    IV. The wage standards and wage systems for workers and staff of local state-owned enterprises should be formulated with reference to the wage standards and wage systems for workers and staff of central state-owned enterprises, based on the conditions of the enterprise's scale, equipment, technical level, and current wage situation. Those whose above-mentioned conditions are roughly the same as the central state-owned enterprises of the same type in the local area can adopt the wage standards for workers and staff of central state-owned enterprises; those whose conditions are worse than the central state-owned enterprises of the same type should have lower wage standards than the central state-owned enterprises.
    The wage reform plans for loading and unloading workers and enterprise odd-job workers should be proposed by the respective competent departments and implemented after unified balancing by the people's committees of provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the central government.
    Enterprises that implemented joint state-private ownership before the full industry-wide joint state-private ownership should generally carry out wage reforms at the same time as state-owned enterprises, so that their wage standards and wage systems are roughly the same as state-owned enterprises of the same nature and similar scale in the same area; current wage standards that are higher than those of local state-owned enterprises of the same type shall not be lowered. The wage systems of enterprises that implement joint state-private ownership after full industry-wide joint state-private ownership and enterprises and institutions directly transformed from private to state-owned shall be studied and proposed by the central competent departments at a meeting in the second half of this year, and the adjustment and reform plans shall be reported to the State Council for approval and implementation.
    V. In order to ensure that the actual income of workers and staff after this wage increase is indeed increased as it should be, and that their lives are indeed improved as they should be, the following tasks must also be done well at the same time as wage reform: 1. Commercial departments and the people's committees of cities and industrial and mining areas should earnestly do a good job in the production and supply of consumer goods, especially non-staple foods, in cities and industrial and mining areas. Enterprises and enterprise competent departments should also pay attention to this work. Industrial and mining enterprises in some remote areas should increase the establishment of living supply institutions under possible conditions; 2. Each enterprise should actively improve labor organization and strive to reduce work stoppages in production and idleness in capital construction projects; 3. Rationally use enterprise bonus funds, medical expenses, worker welfare funds, and labor insurance funds, so that these expenses play a greater role in improving the lives of workers and staff.
    Each industry and region must strive to complete and overfulfill the plans for increasing labor productivity, reducing costs, and remitting profits, so as to ensure the continuous increase of national accumulation, and create a more reliable material basis for expanding reproduction, strengthening the country's economic strength, and further improving the lives of workers and staff.
    VI. The wage issue is a very important issue related to the development of the national economy and the material welfare of the vast number of workers and staff. All departments of the State Council and people's committees at all levels should pay special attention to it, strengthen regular leadership over wage work, and improve wage work institutions. The current primary task is to vigorously do a good job in this wage reform, so as to further exert the material incentive effect of wages, promote the continuous upsurge of the national economy, and gradually improve the lives of workers and staff.

    国务院关于工资改革的决定
    （1956年6月16日国务院全体会议第32次会议通过）
    一、几年来，政府根据在发展生产、提高劳动生产率的基础上逐步改善职工生活的方针，相当地提高了职工的工资水平；同时，按地区和部门进行过一次或者几次的工资改革，初步地建立了按劳取酬的工资制度。这对于鼓励职工提高业务技术水平，提高劳动生产率和工作效率，促进国民经济的恢复和发展，起了积极的作用。但是，工资的提高在年度之间存在着不平衡现象，1953年以前提高较快，1954年和1955年则由于工业、基本建设、交通运输等部门的工资标准没有调整，取消了一些不合理的奖励、津贴制度后，合理的奖励、津贴制度没有及时建立，对职工的升级控制过紧，以及某些企业和工程单位有停工窝工现象，因而上述这些部门职工的平均工资提高的速度较慢，同劳动生产率提高的速度不相适应，加之副食品的价格有些上涨，以致一部分职工的实际工资还有降低，这是政府工资工作的一个严重的缺点。在以往的工资改革中，对于旧的工资制度遗留下来的不合理的因素还没有完全克服，并且随着国民经济的迅速发展和变化，又产生了一些新的问题，以致在目前工资制度中还有不少不符合按劳取酬原则和不符合生产发展需要的现象，特别是平均主义现象还相当严重。这种情况必须努力克服。
    目前全国职工建设社会主义的热潮正在不断地高涨，为了更好地鼓励职工提高业务技术水平，巩固和提高职工的劳动热情，进一步开展先进生产者运动，提高劳动生产率，提前完成和超额完成国家的第一个五年计划的伟大任务，国务院现在决定适当地提高工资水平，并且在这个条件下，根据按劳取酬的原则，对企业（包括国营企业、供销合作社企业、全行业公私合营前的公私合营企业）、事业和国家机关的工资制度，进行进一步改革。凡是这次进行工资改革的企业、事业和国家机关一律从1956年4月1日起实行新的工资标准。
    二、根据国家工业和农业的发展情况和当前的政治经济任务，根据职工工资的提高必须与劳动生产率的提高相适应和劳动生产率提高的速度又必须超过工资提高的速度的原则，确定1956年企业、事业和国家机关职工的平均工资提高14.5％（如包括1956年新增人员在内，则为13％左右）。根据按劳取酬的原则和国家工业化的政策以及现在的工资情况，在这次工资改革中，对于重工业部门、重点建设地区、高级技术工人和高级科学、技术人员的工资，应该有较多的提高；对于现行工资待遇比较低的小学教职员、供销合作社工作人员和乡干部的工资，也应该有较多的提高；同时，对现行工资水平较高的沿海城市和其他地区某些单位的工资，一般地也应该稍有提高。
    三、在这次工资改革中，应该采取和实行如下措施：
    1、取消工资分制度和物价津贴制度，实行直接用货币规定工资标准的制度，以消除工资分和物价津贴给工资制度带来的不合理现象，并且简化工资计算手续，便于企业推行经济核算制度。根据各地区发展生产的需要、物价生活水平和现实工资状况，规定不同的货币工资标准。对于物价高的地区为了避免出现过高的工资标准，可以采取在工资标准以外另加生活费补贴的办法。生活费补贴应该随着物价的调整而调整。
    2、改进工人的工资等级制度，使熟练劳动和不熟练劳动，繁重劳动和轻易劳动，在工资标准上有比较明显的差别。适当地扩大高等级工人和低等级工人之间工资标准的差额；做到高温工作工人的工资标准高于常温工作工人的工资标准，井下工作工人的工资标准高于井上工作工人的工资标准，计件工资标准高于计时工资标准，以克服工资待遇上的平均主义现象。同时，为了使工人的工资等级制度更加合理，各产业部门必须根据实际情况制定和修订工人的技术等级标准，严格地按照技术等级标准进行考工升级，使升级成为一种正常的制度。
    3、改进企业职员和技术人员的工资制度。企业职员和技术人员的工资标准，应该根据他们所担任的职务进行统一规定。每个职务的工资可以分为若干等级，高一级职务和低一级职务的工资等级线，可以交叉。对于技术人员，除了按照他们所担任的职务评定工资以外，对其中技术水平较高的，应该加发技术津贴；对企业有重要贡献的高级技术人员，应该加发特定津贴，务使他们的工资收入有较多地增加。有些高级技术人员的现行工资标准高于新定职务工资标准的，可以给他们单独规定工资，使他们的工资仍然有所增加。对于某些地区和某些产业的工程技术人员，如果目前按职务统一规定工资标准确有困难的时候，可以单独规定技术人员的工资标准，但是必须注意与实行职务工资的同类技术人员之间的工资水平适当平衡，不能差别过大。
    对于事业单位和国家机关中有重要贡献的高级科学技术人员及其他高级知识分子，除了按照他们的工资标准发给工资以外，也应该加发特定津贴。
    4、推广和改进计件工资制。各产业都应该制定切实可行的推广计件工资制的计划和统一的计件工资规程，凡是能够计件的工作，应该在1957年全部或大部实行计件工资制。同时，必须建立并且健全定期（一般为一年）审查和修改定额的制度，保证定额具有技术根据和比较先进的水平。实行计件工资标准的时候，应该由低到高，逐渐增加，并且必须同时修改落后的定额。
    5、改进企业奖励工资制度。各主管部门应该根据生产的需要制定统一的奖励办法，积极建立和改进新产品试制、节约原材料、节约燃料或者电力、提高产品质量以及超额完成任务等奖励制度。
    6、改进津贴制度。审查现有的各种津贴办法，克服目前津贴方面存在的混乱现象，建立和健全生产上必需的津贴制度。各部门、各地区应该按照他们主管的业务范围在1956年内分别提出改进津贴制度的方案，报告国务院批准实行。
    四、地方国营企业的工人和职员的工资标准和工资制度，应该根据企业的规模、设备、技术水平和现在的工资情况等条件，参照中央国营企业的工人和职员的工资标准和工资制度制定。上述条件与当地同类性质的中央国营企业大致相同的，可以采用中央国营企业的工人和职员的工资标准；条件差于同类性质的中央国营企业的，其工资标准应该低于中央国营企业。
    对于装卸工人和企业勤杂人员的工资改革方案，由各主管部门提出，经省、自治区、直辖市人民委员会统一平衡后实行。
    在全行业公私合营以前实行了公私合营的企业，一般的应该与国营企业同时进行工资改革，使它们的工资标准和工资制度与同一地区性质相同、规模相近的国营企业大致相同；现行工资标准高于当地同类性质国营企业的，一律不予降低。在全行业公私合营以后实行公私合营的企业和由私营直接转为国营的企业，事业单位的工资制度，由中央主管部门在今年下半年召开会议，研究和提出调整和改革方案，报告国务院批准实行。
    五、为了保证这次提高工资后职工的实际收入确实得到应有的增加，生活确实得到应有的改善，在工资改革的同时，还必须做好以下几项工作：1、商业部门及城市和工矿区的人民委员会，应该切实做好城市和工矿区的消费品特别是副食品的生产和供应工作，企业和企业主管部门也应该重视这个工作，某些偏僻地区的工矿企业应该在可能条件下增设生活供应机构；2、各企业应该积极改善劳动组织，力求减少生产中的停工和基本建设工程中的窝工现象；3、合理地使用企业奖励基金、医药费、职工福利费和劳动保险基金，使这些费用对于改善职工生活发挥更大的作用。
    各产业、各地区必须力求完成和超额完成提高劳动生产率计划、降低成本计划和上缴利润计划，以保证国家积累的不断增加，为扩大再生产、增强国家的经济力量和进一步改善职工生活创造更加可靠的物质基础。
    六、工资问题是关联着国民经济的发展和广大工人职员的物质福利的一个十分重要的问题，国务院各部门、各级人民委员会都应该特别予以重视，加强对工资工作的经常领导，健全工资工作机构。当前首要的任务是大力做好这次工资改革工作，达到进一步发挥工资的物质鼓励作用，促进国民经济的不断高涨和逐步改善职工生活的目的。
