    Reactions to Newspaper Editorials from Organizations
    Some of the People's Daily editorials promptly raise various important issues that are closely related to the lives of people nationwide. Therefore, the editorial department should pay attention to collecting and publishing readers' reactions to the People's Daily editorials in the newspaper. Only in this way can the role of the editorials be enhanced, and the editorial department can better understand the opinions and demands of the masses. (Deng Shoujiu)
    Editor: Deng Shoujiu's suggestion is very good. We hope that readers, after reading the editorials in this newspaper, will promptly write to the editorial department to inform us of the impact of the editorials on practical work in your local areas, as well as your various opinions on the editorials.

    组织对报纸社论的反应
    人民日报的有些社论，及时地提出了各种重要的问题，它与全国人民的生活有密切的关系。因此，编辑部应该注意收集并在报纸上发表读者对于人民日报社论的反应，只有这样，才能提高社论的作用，并且使编辑部更多地了解群众的意见和要求。　（邓寿樛）
    编者：邓寿樛的意见很好，希望读者在读了本报的社论以后，随时把社论在当地实际工作中所起的影响，以及你们对于社论的各种意见，写信告诉本报编辑部。
