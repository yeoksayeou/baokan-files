Tsinghua University Library Orders Large Quantities of Scientific Books and Periodicals

    (Our report) The Tsinghua University Library is actively expanding its sources of books and periodicals and enriching its reference materials. In recent months, it has ordered a large number of Western books from abroad and increased its subscriptions to Russian and Western scientific and technical journals. In April and May alone, the expenditure on books ordered from capitalist countries exceeded the total expenditure on such books over the past three years. Recently, special attention has been paid to the books and periodicals needed for engineering physics and automation. In terms of reference books, a check has been carried out recently, and the opinions of various departments and teaching and research groups have been solicited. It is planned to order and replenish a large number of periodical indexes and world-class bibliographies and book reviews from abroad soon. Starting this year, domestic and foreign publication catalogs have been collected and displayed in the teacher's reading room, and a publication catalog display cabinet has been set up in the library for teachers to view. In order to utilize the books and periodicals of libraries outside the university, the library has purposefully collected the book and periodical catalogs of several large libraries across the country and displayed them in the teacher's reading room. In terms of Chinese newspaper and periodical indexes, in addition to the national major periodical index published by Shandong Provincial Library, which has already been ordered, it is planned to subscribe to eleven major categories of national major newspaper and periodical index cards published by the Shanghai Newspaper and Periodical Library on a long-term basis starting from July this year, and display them in the teacher's reading room. At the end of May, the library also compiled a catalog of all existing foreign bound periodicals in the university and distributed it to various departments and teaching and research groups.
