    "San Wu" Brand Mantel Clocks Have Good Quality
    "Jialing" Brand Alarm Clocks Are Too "Proactive"

    The "San Wu" brand mantel clock is a product of the Shanghai Joint State-Private China Clock and Watch Factory. This kind of clock has a precise structure and a beautiful appearance. Ordinary clocks won't work if they are not placed flat or hung straight, but the "San Wu" brand clock can work whether it is hung straight or at an angle. Generally, the hands of other brands of clocks should not be turned backward, but the "San Wu" brand clock can be turned backward or forward, and it doesn't misstrike the hour. Ordinary brands of clocks can only run for seven days with each winding, while the "San Wu" brand clock can run for about fifteen days. Recently, the ex-factory price of the "San Wu" brand mantel clock has been reduced by about seven or eight yuan compared to before.

    The alarm clocks produced by the Joint State-Private Yantai Clock Factory used to be of poor quality. Consumers complained that they were "not as accurate as a rooster's crow." However, the "Baozi" brand long three-needle back bell alarm clock manufactured by this factory recently has greatly improved. This clock has a round shape, which is very beautiful, and the internal structure is quite precise. The alarm time difference is within two minutes. The disadvantage is that some clocks are five minutes fast or slow, and the winding key is not firmly installed, making it easy to slip and fall off.

    The "Diamond" brand alarm clock recently produced by the Shanghai Joint State-Private Jinsheng Clock Factory has improved in quality. The screws used to be made of copper, which was not wear-resistant; now they are made with glass eyes, which can extend the service life and make the clock run more accurately. The disadvantages are: the winding key is prone to slipping, and the alarm bell is somewhat liberal, sometimes it doesn't ring when it should, and sometimes it rings automatically when it shouldn't.

    The "Xiangqiu" brand four-pillar mantel clock is a product of the Joint State-Private Tianjin Clock and Watch Factory this year. The ex-factory price for each is 28.8 yuan. This mantel clock has a rough and unattractive appearance, and there are many shortcomings in the internal components, such as uneven wheels, non-rotating steel wire wheels, and easily damaged clips. The "Jinji" brand double-bell alarm clock produced by this factory has even more problems. The processing of each part is very rough, and the tolerances of the shaft and shaft hole, and the tolerances of the clip shaft and shaft hole are very large.

    The "Jialing" brand hidden-bell alarm clock produced by the Chongqing Jialing Clock and Watch Factory in Sichuan Province has an ex-factory price of more than 13 yuan per clock. The clock case is made of bakelite, which is easily broken. The hour hand adjuster is too short, making it difficult to adjust. The hour hand is so wide that it obscures the time numerals on the surface. The central shaft steel wire wheel is made of copper, which is not wear-resistant and affects the life of the clock. This clock is too "proactive," running about fifteen minutes fast every day. (Sun Guang)

### 三五牌座钟质量较好  嘉陵牌闹钟过于“积极”

    三五牌座钟质量较好
    嘉陵牌闹钟过于“积极”
    三五牌座钟是上海公私合营中国钟表厂的产品。这种钟的构造精细，外表也很美观。一般的钟都是放不平不走，挂得不正也不走，三五牌钟直挂、斜挂都可以走。一般牌号的钟，表针不宜倒拨，三五牌钟则倒拨正拨都行，还不乱打点。一般牌号的钟每上一次弦只能走七天，而三五牌钟能走十五天左右。最近三五牌座钟的出厂价格比以前便宜了七、八元左右。
    公私合营烟台造钟厂以前生产的闹钟质量不好，消费者反映说：“还不如公鸡叫得准确。”可是这个厂最近制造的宝字牌长三针的背铃闹钟，却大有改进。这种钟的外形是圆的，很美观，钟的内部构造相当精细，闹时差分在二分钟以内。缺点是有的钟快慢差五分钟，上弦钥匙安装得不牢固，容易滑丝脱落。
    上海公私合营金声制钟厂，最近出品的钻石牌闹钟质量有所改进。以前的螺丝是用铜做的，不耐磨；现在是用玻璃钻眼的，可延长使用寿命，走起来也比较准确。缺点是：上弦钥匙容易滑牙，闹铃有些自由主义，有时该闹不闹，有时不该闹却自动闹起来。
    象球牌四柱座钟是公私合营天津钟表厂今年的产品。每只出厂价格是二十八元八角。这种座钟外形粗糙，不美观，内部机件也有很多缺点，如各种轮子不平，钢丝轮塞不转动，卡子容易损坏等等。这个厂生产的金鸡牌双铃闹钟毛病更大，每种零件的加工都很粗糙，轴和轴孔的公差、卡子轴和轴孔的公差都很大。
    四川省重庆嘉陵钟表厂生产的嘉陵牌暗铃闹钟，每只出厂价格十三元多。钟的外壳是电木做的，容易碰碎。时针拨动器太短，拨动时很吃力。时针宽得把表面上的时间数字都遮住了。中轴钢丝轮是铜制的，不耐磨，影响钟的寿命。这种钟过于“积极”，每天要快十五分左右。　　　　　　　　　　　（孙光）
