Comrade Ambassador, dear comrades and friends:

On July 11, 1921, the heroic Mongolian people, under the leadership of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party, overthrew the reactionary rule and established a people's revolutionary government, achieving a great revolutionary victory. Today, we gather here to celebrate this glorious great festival. On behalf of the Chinese people and the Chinese government, I extend warm congratulations to the Mongolian people and the government of the Mongolian People's Republic.

The Mongolian people have a long history and culture. Since the Mongolian people achieved revolutionary victory and took control of their destiny, they have made brilliant achievements in the 35 years of devoting themselves to building a prosperous, strong, and happy country.

In November 1924, the First Great People's Hural promulgated the first People's Constitution in Mongolian history. The constitution officially declared the establishment of the Mongolian People's Republic, stipulating and guaranteeing the general line of the Mongolian People's Republic's development towards socialism.

During the era of the people's government, the Mongolian people carried out national economic construction and cultural and educational undertakings on a national scale, which greatly changed the social landscape of Mongolia.

In 1952, the Mongolian people successfully completed the first five-year plan for developing the national economy and culture. Since 1953, the Mongolian people have been striving to successfully complete and strive to overfulfill the second five-year plan. The targets set in the second five-year plan further demonstrate that the economic and cultural undertakings of the Mongolian people will continue to achieve great development.

Animal husbandry is the main sector of the Mongolian national economy, and the state has taken many important measures to develop animal husbandry. A large number of modern grass mowing stations, veterinary networks, and water lifting stations have been established. By the time the second five-year plan is completed in 1957, the total number of livestock owned by Mongolia will increase by 20.7% compared to 1952.

In recent years, Mongolia's industry has undergone new development. In the second five-year plan, the total amount of state investment in industry has increased to 6.6 times that of the first five-year plan. By 1957, the level of industrial production will increase by 46% compared to 1952.

In terms of agricultural production, in the second five-year plan, state investment in agriculture has increased to seven times that of the first five-year plan, and state-owned farms and sown areas are constantly growing.

Since the establishment of the Mongolian People's Republic, the state has vigorously developed highway, railway, and air transportation. In particular, the railway line jointly built by China, Mongolia, and the Soviet Union, which connects the borders of the three countries, has great significance for expanding economic and cultural ties between the three countries.

On the basis of developing production, the material and cultural life of the Mongolian people has also been continuously improved.

Before the revolution, only 0.3% to 0.5% of Mongolian residents were literate. Now, illiteracy among adult residents has been completely eliminated. Various schools train a large number of outstanding political and professional cadres for the country every year, playing an important role in the country's political and economic life.

The Mongolian people are a peace-loving nation. The Mongolian government has always firmly implemented a peaceful foreign policy, making valuable contributions to maintaining peace, opposing aggression, and promoting international friendly cooperation.

Dear comrades and friends, the achievements of the Mongolian people have inspired the Chinese people who are engaged in socialist construction. The friendship between the Chinese and Mongolian people has a long history. The Chinese and Mongolian people once fought together to resist the aggression of the common enemy—Japanese imperialism. This friendship between the Chinese and Mongolian people has been further developed since the founding of the People's Republic of China. Over the past six years, economic cooperation and cultural exchanges between the two countries have become increasingly close. The signing of the Sino-Mongolian Economic and Cultural Cooperation Agreement and the opening of the Sino-Mongolian railway undoubtedly enable the people of China and Mongolia to receive more and greater mutual help and support in the cause of achieving their common goal—completing socialist construction.

Dear comrades and friends, in order to celebrate this glorious and great festival of the Mongolian people, let us shout:

Long live the friendly unity between the Chinese and Mongolian people!

Long live the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party!

Long live the Mongolian People's Republic!

    在北京各界举行蒙古人民革命胜利三十五周年庆祝大会上
    习仲勋秘书长的讲话亲爱的大使同志、亲爱的同志们和朋友们：
    1921年7月11日，英勇的蒙古人民在蒙古人民革命党的领导下，推翻了反动统治，建立了人民革命政权，取得了伟大的革命胜利。今天我们在这里集会庆祝这个光辉的伟大节日，我谨代表中国人民和中国政府向蒙古人民和蒙古人民共和国政府致热烈的祝贺。
    蒙古人民有着悠久的民族文化和历史。自从蒙古人民取得了革命胜利、掌握了自己的命运之后，三十五年来蒙古人民在致力于建设一个繁荣、富强和幸福的国家的事业中，取得了光辉的成就。
    1924年11月第一届大人民呼拉尔颁布了蒙古历史上的第一部人民宪法。宪法正式宣告了蒙古人民共和国的成立，规定和保证了蒙古人民共和国向社会主义发展的总路线。
    在人民政权的年代里，蒙古人民在全国范围内开展了国民经济建设和文化教育事业，从而大大地改变了蒙古的社会面貌。
    1952年，蒙古人民胜利地完成了发展国民经济和文化的第一个五年计划。从1953年起，蒙古人民正在为顺利完成和争取超额完成第二个五年计划而奋斗。第二个五年计划规定的指标进一步显示了蒙古人民的经济和文化事业将继续获得巨大的发展。
    畜牧业是蒙古国民经济的主要部门，国家采取了许多重要的措施来发展畜牧业。大批现代化的割草机站、兽医网和汲水站已经建立起来了。到1957年第二个五年计划完成时，和1952年相比较，蒙古拥有的牲畜总数将增加20.7％。
    近年来，蒙古的工业有了新的发展。在第二个五年计划中，国家对工业的投资总额已增加为第一个五年计划的六点六倍。到1957年，工业生产水平比1952年将提高46％。
    在农业生产方面，第二个五年计划中，国家对农业的投资增加为第一个五年计划的七倍，国营农场和播种面积正在不断增长。
    自从蒙古人民共和国成立以来，国家大力发展了公路、铁路和航空运输。特别是在不久以前中、蒙、苏三国共同建成了连贯三国国境的铁路线，对于扩大三国之间的经济和文化联系，具有重大的意义。
    在发展生产的基础上，蒙古人民的物质文化生活也不断得到了改善。
    革命以前蒙古识字的居民只占0.3％—0.5％。现在，成人居民中的文盲已经完全被扫除了。各种学校每年为国家培养出大批优秀的政治和专业干部，在国家政治、经济生活中起着重要的作用。
    蒙古人民是一个热爱和平的民族。蒙古政府一向坚定不移地执行着和平外交政策，对于维护和平、反对侵略，促进国际友好合作，作着有价值的贡献。
    亲爱的同志们和朋友们，蒙古人民所取得的成就，鼓舞了正在进行社会主义建设的中国人民。中蒙两国人民之间的友谊是有着悠久的历史的。中蒙两国人民曾经为抵抗共同的敌人——日本帝国主义——的侵略而共同作战，中蒙两国人民的这种友谊在中华人民共和国成立后有了进一步的发展。六年多来，两国间的经济合作和文化交流日益密切了。中蒙经济及文化合作协定的签订和中蒙铁路通车的实现，无疑地使中蒙两国人民在为实现他们共同的目标——完成社会主义建设——的事业中，日益得到更多的和更大的互相帮助和互相支持。
    亲爱的同志们和朋友们，为了庆祝蒙古人民的这个光辉的伟大的节日，让我们高呼：
    中蒙两国人民之间的友好团结万岁！
    蒙古人民革命党万岁！
    蒙古人民共和国万岁！
