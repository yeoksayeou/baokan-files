Elderly and Sick Party Members Should Not Be Advised to Withdraw from the Party
Feng Jun

It goes without saying that people will get old and people will get sick. But "old age" and "illness" have become sins for some Communist Party members.

How can this be seen? Please look at some examples:

A female Party member in Jiangdu County, Jiangsu Province, who used to be the director of the township women's federation, is now in her fifties and has been ill for a long time, unable to work. The branch secretary went to "persuade" her to withdraw from the Party, but she refused; he went again, and she still refused; he went a third time and finally managed to persuade her to "voluntarily" withdraw from the Party.

Shen Yueqin, a female Party member in Hutang Township, Caojing District, Songjiang County, was originally the deputy township head, but later developed severe lung disease, and the branch also sent someone to persuade her to withdraw from the Party.

Perhaps these examples are isolated? No. According to statistics from the Party Member Management Office of the Organization Department of the Jiangsu Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, about 30% of the Party members who were advised to withdraw from the Party in the entire province in 1955 were elderly and sick Party members.

The comrades who advise people to withdraw from the Party have good intentions, believing that "the Party has given them the glorious title of Communist Party member, but they cannot work, doesn't this damage the Party's prestige!" In fact, this statement is not well-founded. "Old age and illness" in themselves cannot be used as conditions for advising Party members to withdraw from the Party. Although elderly and sick Party members have some difficulties in work and study, this is caused by objective reasons, not because they themselves have made any mistakes. Moreover, these comrades are not completely unable to fulfill their obligations as Party members, and are not completely unable to play a role among the masses. Even if it is said that they have difficulty participating in work and meetings, as long as they have good performance in dealing with public affairs, with their families and neighbors, with national obligations, and with current affairs and politics, their staying in the Party will not only not damage the Party's prestige, but can also influence and educate the masses with their own exemplary behavior in all aspects. Therefore, the Party organization should not simply push this group of Party members out of the way, but should give them more care, such as holding some Party meetings closer to their homes for those who cannot regularly attend meetings, or adopting individual contact methods to convey Party resolutions and instructions to them and listen to their opinions; when assigning work, their special difficulties can be considered, assigning them less work, or assigning them some work that they can do; for those who are seriously ill and cannot work, the Party organization should take the initiative to relieve them of their duties and help them recover. Of course, this is a bit of a "trouble" for the Party organization, but what reason is there to easily cut off the political lives of these old comrades who have contributed to the Party and the people in the past and have not made any mistakes now because they are afraid of this little trouble?

Of course, if some elderly and sick Party members are indeed politically negative and ideologically degenerate, and keeping them in the Party would damage the Party's prestige, then they can and should be advised to withdraw from the Party.

    不应该劝告年老多病的党员退党
    冯俊
    人总是要老的，也总是要生病的，其实这是不用说的一句话。但是“老”和“病”对于有些共产党员竟然成为罪过了。
    何以见得？请看一些事例：
    江苏省江都县一个女党员，过去担任乡妇联主任的职务，现在五十多岁了，又长期生病，不能工作。支部书记就去“动员”她退党，她不肯；再去，她还不肯；第三次又去，总算说得她“自愿”退了党。
    松江县曹泾区护塘乡女党员沈约琴，原来是副乡长，后来生了严重的肺病，支部也派人动员她退了党。
    也许这些例子是个别的吧？不。中共江苏省委组织部党员管理处统计了一下，1955年全年全省被劝告退党的党员中约有30％是年老多病的党员。
    劝人退党的同志的想法本来是好的，他们认为“党把共产党员的光荣称号给予他们，而他们却不能工作，这不是有损党的威信么！”其实这种说法是没有多少根据的。“年老多病”本身并不能做为劝告党员退党的条件，年老多病的党员，虽然工作、学习上都有些困难，但是，这是客观原因造成的，并不是因为他们本身有什么过错。而且，这些同志也并不是完全不能履行党员的义务，完全不能在群众中发挥作用。即或说他们参加工作、参加会议有困难，但是只要他们在对待公共事务、对家庭邻里、对国家义务、对时事政治等有较好的表现，他们留在党内就不但不会有损党的威信，而且可以以他们自己在各方面的模范行为影响群众、教育群众。因此，党组织不但不应该用简单的办法把这部分党员推出去了事，而且应该更多的关怀他们照顾他们，比如，有些人不能经常参加会议，有些党的会议可以到离他们较近的地方去开，或者采取个别联系的办法向他们传达党的决议、指示，听取他们的意见；分配工作的时候，可以考虑他们的特殊困难，少分配他们一些工作，或者分配他们一些力所能及的工作；有些病重不能工作的，党组织应该主动地解除他们的职务，并且帮助他养好病。当然，这样做对于党组织来说是要“麻烦”一点，可是，又有什么理由因为怕这一点麻烦，而轻易断送这些过去对党和人民有过贡献现在又没有过错的老同志的政治生命？
    当然，如果有些年老多病的党员，的确政治消极，思想堕落，把他们留在党内有损党的威信，那就可以也应该劝告他们退党。
