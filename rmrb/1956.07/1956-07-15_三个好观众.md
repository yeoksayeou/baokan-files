Title: Three Good Audience Members

Speaking from what I know, there are three people who can truly be said to be good at watching plays.

I am talking about people from ancient times.

King Zhuang of Chu is the first good audience member I thought of. He had an entertainer named Meng. The story is clearly recorded in the "Biographies of Jesters" in "Records of the Grand Historian." Perhaps some have forgotten it, so I will simply give a brief account. He dressed up as King Zhuang's Prime Minister Sun Shuao, singing songs and saying that he had helped King Zhuang become a hegemon, but after his death, his son was so poor that he had nowhere to stand. King Zhuang of Chu, upon hearing this, thought he was being accused of being ungrateful, but instead of getting angry, he accepted the criticism and granted Sun Shuao's son a piece of land. He had the magnanimity to correct his mistakes, which was no small feat.

There was a Greek comedian named Aristophanes who loved to satirize people sharply. He often put real people on stage, fortunately not depicting real events, which gave his satire a broader significance. He hated scholars who taught by rote, were obsessed with money, indulged in abstract thinking, were divorced from reality, and were completely incomprehensible. He wrote a satirical play called "The Clouds" to mock these teachers. Among them, Socrates was the most respected, so he made Socrates the target of his play. When the play opened, the audience sat on the hillside and saw a basket hanging in the air on the stage, with Socrates sitting inside, lost in thought. At this point, a playgoer stood up from the audience, took off his hat, revealed his famous square bald head, turned to the entire audience, and said with a smile: "Look, I am Socrates!"

He is the second good audience member I thought of, not only not angry but also joining in the fun. If he hadn't made it public, I think he might have enjoyed himself even more.

My third good audience member is Molière, who specialized in writing plays satirizing social customs. He was a Frenchman, living more than three hundred years ago. He wrote "The School for Wives" to attack the patriarchal society's education for women. The ruling class, in order to counterattack, found someone to write a "Portrait of a Painter" to ridicule him. People thought he would have to hide, but instead, he paid the highest price, sat next to the stage, silently, "laughing along with others at the image of him they had portrayed." (His own words.)

Are we all good at watching plays now? If we all have "room in our bellies to float a boat" like a prime minister, with broad minds, as long as the playwright's purpose is to promote the early realization of a socialist society, even if it is to satirize ourselves, we would be willing to be generous and join in the laughter. Wouldn't that be great?

Isn't that right? For a broader satirical significance, for future generations, for our cause, little "Monkey" after its appearance in "Script" monthly, also passed the test in "Literary Gazette". We are all good at watching plays, so we must support "Monkey". Because along with it, there will be many excellent satirical works, even an entire genre (from satirical short plays to comedies of manners).

    三个好观众
    石习之
    就我知道的来说，有三个人的确可以说是会看戏了。
    我说的是古人。
    楚庄王是我想到的头一个好观众。他有一个姓孟的艺人，——这段故事，“史记”的“滑稽列传”记的明明白白的，也许有人忘记了，我就简单交代两句罢。他扮成庄王的宰相孙叔敖，唱着歌，说他辅佐庄王成为霸王，不料他死后，他的儿子贫无立锥之地。楚庄王听见骂他忘恩负义，不但不生气，反而接受批评，封了孙叔敖儿子一块地。他有雅量，还能痛改前非，很不简单。
    古希腊有一位喜剧家阿里斯托芬，好尖刻地讽刺人。他往往把真人搬上台来，所幸不演真事，因而有了更广的讽刺意义。他讨厌学究，死教书，死要钱，凌空设想，脱离实际，完全不知所云。他写了一出讽刺剧“云”，嘲笑这批教书先生。他们中间，人望数苏格拉底高，他就派苏格拉底做他戏上的箭靶子。戏开了，观众坐在半山腰，望见台上半空挂着一只筐子，苏格拉底坐在里头，出神冥想。这其间便见台下有一个看戏的站了起来，去掉帽子，露出他有名的四方秃顶，转向全体观众，喜笑颜开，说：“看呀，我就是苏格拉底！”
    他是我想到的第二个好观众，不但不生气，反而凑趣。如果他不张扬，我想，他也许就格外自得其乐了。我的第三个好观众就是专爱写戏讽刺世态的莫里哀。他是一个法国人，离而今也有三百多年了。他写“夫人学堂”攻击男权社会的妇女教育。统治阶级人物为了反击起见，找人写了一出“画家像赞”揶揄他。人家以为他非藏起来不可了，不料他花最高票价，坐到台旁，不声不响，“和旁人一道笑他们刻画出来的他的形象”。（——他自己的话。）
    如今我们是不是全会看戏了呢？如果我们个个“宰相肚里好撑船”，胸襟宽阔，只要剧作家的目的是在促使社会主义社会早日实现，那怕是讽刺自己，我们也肯恢恢大度，敬陪一笑，岂不是太好的事么？
    不是吗？为了更广的讽刺意义，为了未来弟妹，为了我们的事业，小小“猴儿”在“剧本”月刊之后，又在“文艺报”过关。我们全会看戏了，所以一定要为“猴儿”撑腰。因为和它一同过关的，将有许许多多优秀讽刺作品，甚至于整个剧种（从讽刺短剧到世态喜剧）。
