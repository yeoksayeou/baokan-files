    Repairing the Palace Museum to Restore its Original Appearance

    (Our report) The Palace Museum has 26 maintenance and repair projects this year, an increase of 20% in maintenance and repair area compared to last year. The larger projects currently underway include the repair of the East Goose Wing Tower of the Meridian Gate, the East Chaofang (official rooms) of the Gate of Supreme Harmony, and the Northwest Corner Tower, as well as the drainage and roof maintenance of the platforms of the East Prosperity Gate, the West Prosperity Gate, and the Gate of Divine Might.
  In order to maintain the original appearance of the ancient buildings, photographs and surveys must be taken before construction begins, and detailed research and preparation work must be carried out with reference to books on palace architecture. The materials for maintenance and repair must also be selected according to the original specifications and quality. At the same time, some modern scientific maintenance methods are also adopted. The gold brick floors of the Hall of Preserving Harmony, the Palace of Heavenly Purity, and the Hall of Mental Cultivation have been coated with a layer of tung oil according to the old method to increase the wear resistance of the bricks. In order to prevent the fading of painted decorations and the weathering of stone carvings, a chemical coating is being prepared. Lightning rods will be installed on the repaired East Goose Wing Tower of the Meridian Gate and the top of the corner tower of the Forbidden City.
    The person in charge of the Architectural Research Office of the Palace Museum told reporters that this imperial palace of the Ming and Qing dynasties was completed in 1420. Before liberation, many buildings were dilapidated due to years of disrepair and damage. Now the museum has formulated a twelve-year plan to gradually restore the original appearance of the Palace Museum.

    修缮故宫让它恢复本来面貌
    本报讯　故宫博物院今年的保养和修缮工程共有二十六项，比去年的保养和修缮面积增加了20％。现在正进行的较大工程有午门东雁翅楼、太和门东朝房和西北角楼的修缮工程，以及东华门、西华门、神武门的墩台排水和屋顶保养工程。
  为了保持古建筑物的原样，在动工前要拍照、测绘，并参考宫廷建筑书籍，进行细致的研究和准备工作。保养和修缮的材料也都要按照原来的规格和质量来选择。同时也采用一些近代的科学保养方法。现在保和殿、乾清宫和养心殿的金砖地，已经根据老方法涂上一层桐油，以增加砖的耐磨力。为了防止彩画退色和石雕风化，正准备涂一种化学涂料。修缮后的午门东雁翅楼和紫禁城角楼顶上，都将安装避雷针。
    故宫博物院建筑研究室的负责人对记者说，这座明清两代的皇宫，在1420年建筑完成。解放前由于多年失修和破坏，许多建筑已破烂不堪。现在博物院已经订出十二年规划，准备逐步恢复故宫的本来面貌。
