Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, July 25th: The expression of the Indonesian Vice President Hatta that he would resign after the establishment of the Constituent Assembly has attracted the attention of Indonesian political circles and public opinion.

A spokesman for the Masjumi Party, which is considered close to Hatta, said on July 24 that the disagreement between Vice President Hatta and President Sukarno is already an open secret. He expressed concern that this division would become apparent after Hatta's resignation.

Hatta resigned as Prime Minister in August 1950 and became Vice President.

The leader of the Perti Islamic Party, Abbas, said, "The reasons Hatta gave [for resigning] are insufficient. I believe there must be deeper behind-the-scenes reasons for his intentions."

An editorial in "Republik" expressed doubt as to whether Hatta would withdraw from politics after his resignation and really concentrate all his attention on the cooperative movement as he said, or whether he might be preparing to run for president as Sukarno's opponent in the future. "Great Indonesia Daily" speculated that Hatta might be nominated by the Masjumi Party and others as a candidate for the speaker of the Constituent Assembly.

    印度尼西亚政界和舆论
    对哈达辞职的反应
    据新华社雅加达25日电　印度尼西亚副总统哈达要在制宪议会成立后辞职的表示引起了印度尼西亚政界和舆论的注意。
    被认为和哈达接近的马斯友美党的发言人七月二十四日说，副总统哈达和总统苏加诺意见不合已经是公开的秘密。他表示担心这种分歧在哈达辞职后会表面化。
    哈达是在1950年8月辞去总理职务而任副总统的。
    白尔蒂伊斯兰党领袖阿巴斯说，“哈达提出（辞职）的理由是不充分的。我相信他的打算一定有更深的幕后原因。”
      “共和国报”的社论表示怀疑哈达在辞职以后是不是会脱离政治而真的像他所说的那样把他的全部注意力集中在合作运动上，或者，他是否可能准备在以后作为苏加诺的对手参加总统竞选。“大印度尼西亚报”推测，哈达可能被马斯友美党等提名为制宪议会议长的候选人。
