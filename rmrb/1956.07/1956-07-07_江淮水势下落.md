    Jianghuai Water Levels Recede
    (From Our Newspaper) The water levels of the Yangtze and Huai Rivers are now trending downwards. At Shashi in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River, the highest water level at 6:00 AM on the first of this month reached 44.19 meters, exceeding the warning level by 1.19 meters. By 8:00 AM on the sixth, the water level had dropped back to 41.52 meters. The newly built Dujiatai flood diversion project in the lower reaches of the Han River opened its gates for flood diversion at 2:00 PM on the second. By 4:00 PM on the fourth, a total of 254 million cubic meters of floodwater had been diverted, playing a certain role in reducing the flood peaks of the Yangtze and Han Rivers.
    The water level in the upper reaches of the Huai River's main stream has also gradually subsided in recent days. The fourth flood peak passed Zhengyangguan at 3:00 AM on the sixth.
    Currently, the Jiang and Huai flood control agencies are seizing the interlude between flood peaks to organize forces and actively carry out dike reinforcement and hazard remediation work, preparing to deal with possible re-emergence of flood peaks.

    江淮水势下落
    本报讯　长江、淮河现在水势趋落。长江中游沙市在本月一日上午六时的最高水位曾达44.19公尺，超过警戒水位1.19公尺。到六日上午八时水位已回落到41.52公尺。新建的汉江下游杜家台分洪工程已在二日下午二时开闸分洪，到四日下午四时共分洪25，400万立方公尺，对削减长江和汉水洪峰起了一定作用。
    淮河干流上游水势近日来也逐渐平落，第四次洪峰在六日上午三时已过正阳关。
    目前，江、淮防汛机关正抓紧洪峰间歇，组织力量，积极进行堤防加固和整险等工作，准备对待可能再出现的洪峰。
