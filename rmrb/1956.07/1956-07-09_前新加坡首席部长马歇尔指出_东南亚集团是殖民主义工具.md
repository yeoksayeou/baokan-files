    Former Singapore Chief Minister Marshall Points Out
    Southeast Asia Group is a Tool of Colonialism
    (Dispatch from our newspaper in Tokyo) Former Singapore Chief Minister Marshall told reporters in Tokyo on July 6th that the Manila Treaty Organization is a tool serving colonialism. He pointed out: The Southeast Asia Treaty Organization is very likely to become a tool that Britain can use to maintain its colonialism in Singapore. He said: Britain in London has made it "very clear" that Singapore will not get even "a little bit of freedom" because Britain, facing the loss of its base in Ceylon, needs the base in Singapore to fulfill its military obligations to the Southeast Asia Group.
    Marshall also spoke about the embargo against China. He said: The trade embargo against China is "silly," and this embargo is causing losses to Singapore. "If we can normalize trade with China, this may have its impact on China and Singapore. I don't believe that a blockade can be imposed on a large country like China."
    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, July 7th: Former Singapore Chief Minister and Labor Front Chairman Marshall said to reporters in Yokohama, Japan on July 6th that Singapore is willing to be friendly with the three major Asian countries—India, China, and Japan.
    According to a Reuters report, Marshall said that the practice of being hostile to China has reached a point where it is not beneficial. The rest of the world cannot ignore the more than 600 million energetic Chinese people.
    He said that his visit to China was to understand the situation. He hoped to understand whether the Chinese people believed in the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence announced by Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai. He was particularly concerned about whether the Chinese would fulfill the principle of guaranteeing non-interference in the internal affairs of another country. He believes that the current situation of "isolating" China is unhealthy for the development of Singapore and the rest of the world.
    Regarding the establishment of trade relations between Singapore and China, Marshall said that he expected a business inspection delegation organized by four chambers of commerce in Singapore to go to China with him. He believes that the trade embargo against China is "silly."

    前新加坡首席部长马歇尔指出
    东南亚集团是殖民主义工具
    本报讯　东京消息：到日本访问的前新加坡首席部长马歇尔七月六日在东京对记者说：马尼拉条约组织是一个为殖民主义服务的工具。他指出：东南亚条约组织大有成为英国可以用来保持它在新加坡的殖民主义的工具之势。他说：英国在伦敦“非常清楚地”表明，新加坡甚至连“一点点自由”都不会得到，因为面临丧失在锡兰的基地的英国需要新加坡的基地来履行它对东南亚集团的军事义务。
    马歇尔还谈到关于对中国禁运问题。他说：对中国的贸易禁运是“无聊的”，这种禁运是使新加坡受到损失，“如果我们能够使同中国的贸易正常化，这也许会在中国和新加坡产生它的影响。我不相信能对像中国这样一个大国实行封锁。”
    据新华社7日讯　东京消息：新加坡前首席部长、劳工阵线主席马歇尔在七月六日到日本横滨对记者发表谈话说，新加坡愿意同亚洲的三个大国——印度、中国和日本友好相处。
    据路透社报道，马歇尔说，敌视中国的做法已经达到了没有任何益处的地位，世界其他地方都无法漠视六亿多生气勃勃的中国人。
    他说，他访问中国是去了解情况。他希望了解中国人民是否相信中国周恩来总理所宣布的五项共处原则。他特别关心的是，中国人是否履行那一项保证不干涉另一个国家的内政的原则。他认为，目前“隔离”中国的情况，对于新加坡和世界其他地方的发展都是不健康的。
    关于新加坡同中国建立贸易关系问题，马歇尔表示，他预期由新加坡四家商会组织的一个工商考察代表团将和他一起去中国。他认为对中国的贸易禁运是“无聊”。
