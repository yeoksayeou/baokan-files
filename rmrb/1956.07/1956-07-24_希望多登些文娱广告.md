    Hoping for More Cultural and Entertainment Advertisements
    The movie and drama advertisements published in the People's Daily are too incomplete, only featuring some large cinemas and a few drama and opera advertisements. The People's Daily is a national newspaper, and it is impossible to use too much space to publish Beijing's cultural and entertainment advertisements; however, cultural and entertainment life is an indispensable part of people's lives, and the People's Daily has the largest sales volume in Beijing, so the newspaper should appropriately cater to the needs of Beijing readers. Of course, the font size of cultural and entertainment advertisements can be smaller, as long as they are complete, without taking up too much space. (Wang Cunjü)

    希望多登些文娱广告
    人民日报刊登的电影戏剧广告太不完全，只有些大影院和几个话剧、歌剧的广告。人民日报是全国性的报纸，不可能用太多的篇幅来登载北京的文娱广告；但是，文娱生活是人民生活不可缺少的一部分，而且人民日报在北京的销售量最大，报纸应该适当照顾到北京读者的需要。当然，文娱广告的字体可以小些，只要登的完全就行了，不要占太多的篇幅。　（王存炬）
