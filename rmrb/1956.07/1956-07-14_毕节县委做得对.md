    The Bijie County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Guizhou Province recently insisted on implementing the leadership style of holding fewer meetings and going down to the grassroots level for in-depth and specific guidance. The number of meetings, the time spent, and the number of people involved in the more than 30 types of meetings originally planned by various departments in the county for June and July were reduced by half. Since April, among the 19 members of the County Committee, apart from the 8 members who lead the daily work of the organs, the remaining 11 members have each spent an average of more than 10 days a month going deep into various districts and townships. The secretary of the County Committee, Comrade Shi Nianhao, after going deep into the Happiness Agricultural Production Cooperative in Happiness Township, a key township of the County Committee, discovered that there were many problems in the cooperative's leadership of production teams and the integration of agricultural and sideline production. He promptly mobilized the cooperative members to solve them. Before the trial calculation and distribution work in the county, Comrade Shi Nianhao explored the experience of trial calculation and distribution in the Happiness Cooperative, and then introduced it at the district, township cadre, and cooperative director conference, so that everyone clarified the purpose, significance, and specific methods of trial calculation and distribution. Another member of the County Committee, female Deputy County Head Xiang Bi'ying, went deep into the Guangming Agricultural Production Cooperative in Gehai Township, a remote area of the 13th District, and found that the cooperative members were not very enthusiastic because the hemp garden land left was insufficient. All 170 Miao households in the cooperative did not work. Xiang consulted and studied with them, and then, based on the principle of voluntariness, re-allocated enough hemp garden land to the Miao cooperative members. All 170 households who had not been working before started working.
    After the Bijie County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party went deep into the grassroots level, it discovered and solved many problems that could not be discovered or solved in the office. This is indeed a very good "cooling agent" for those leading organs who are still keen on holding meetings and have no interest in going down to the grassroots level.

    毕节县委做得对
    中共贵州省毕节县委最近坚持贯彻执行了少开会、多下去的深入具体的领导作风，县里各部门原来准备在六、七月份召开的三十多种会议的次数、时间、人数都缩减了一半。四月份以来，县委十九个委员当中，除了领导机关日常工作的八个委员以外，其余十一个委员每人平均一个月用十天以上的时间深入各区乡，县委书记时念好同志深入到县委重点乡——幸福乡幸福农业生产合作社后，发现该社对生产队的领导、农副业生产结合等都存在不少问题，便及时发动社员解决。在全县试算分配工作前，时念好同志在幸福社摸索出试算分配的经验，然后在区、乡干部、社主任大会上作了介绍，使大家明确了试算分配的目的、意义和具体做法。另一县委委员、女副县长项毕英深入到边远的十三区戈海乡光明农业生产合作社，发现该社因麻园地留的不足，社员情绪不高，全社一百七十户苗族社员全不出工，项便和他们商量、研究，然后本自愿原则，重新给苗族社员留足了麻园地，原来不出工的一百七十户全部出工了。
    中共毕节县委深入基层以后，发现并解决了许多在办公室里不能发现不能解决的问题，这对那些到今天仍热中于开会而没有兴趣下去的领导机关说来，确实是一付再好也没有的“清凉剂”。
