    Quickly Resolve Transportation Bottleneck Problems
    By Our Correspondent Gu Ye
    Shanxi Province is experiencing a severe transportation bottleneck. The production of factories and mines, the construction of basic infrastructure projects, and the daily lives of the people are all being affected to some extent.
    Amidst the widespread transportation congestion, this province, known as the "Land of Coal and Iron," has a large backlog of coal that cannot be shipped out. Workers at the Dongshan Coal Mine are actively increasing production to strive to reach the 1957 production level this year. However, due to insufficient transportation capacity, the coal produced has exceeded the quota by several times. The coal piles are smoking and there is a risk of spontaneous combustion. By June, the Xiyu Coal Mine had 75,000 tons of coal in storage. According to regulations, coal piles should not exceed two meters in height, but the coal piles at this mine are as high as twenty-six meters. To avoid spontaneous combustion and destruction of the coal, the mine, with the approval of higher authorities, has suspended production since June 14. On the other hand, some places are experiencing a coal shortage. Coal shortages have occurred several times at coal supply points in Taiyuan City's Gu Yi Street and the suburban Yijing area. The Wanbailin District of Taiyuan is not far from the mines, but some factory and mine canteens in this area have burned firewood for several consecutive days because they could not buy coal. Units that had run out of firewood had to "suspend meals," and workers were forced to buy cooked food in the market.
    Many items urgently needed by farmers, such as new agricultural tools, chemical fertilizers, and general merchandise, are stuck on the road and cannot be supplied in time. More than 30,000 jin of sweet potato seedlings shipped from Anhui to Yuanping rotted after being backlogged for half a month due to a lack of transportation.
    Some enterprises that have a significant impact on the production of many factories and mines across the country have affected many units because materials are backlogged. Twenty-one of the twenty-two cement plants in the country rely on the Xishan Gypsum Plant in Taiyuan for their entire supply of gypsum. This year, basic construction sites need a large amount of cement, and whether cement plants can increase production depends largely on whether the supply of gypsum can be met. In particular, the widespread use of "dry-hardened concrete" on many construction sites has further increased the demand for gypsum. Therefore, the Xishan Gypsum Plant not only affects the production of twenty-one cement plants, but also indirectly affects the construction speed of many basic construction departments. However, the gypsum produced by the Xishan Gypsum Plant also cannot be shipped out. From January to May, tens of thousands of tons of gypsum could not be transported from the factory to the station due to a lack of transportation. In June, factories and exporters requested a supply of 16,780 tons of gypsum. Although the Shanxi Provincial Department of Industry forcibly extracted fifteen trucks from the Dongshan Coal Mine at the end of the month to help rush the shipment, more than 5,000 tons still could not be shipped out. If we calculate that the reduction of five tons of gypsum supplied reduces the production of cement by one hundred tons, the loss of reduced cement production and delayed basic construction speed is staggering. Similarly, the sulfur produced by handicraft cooperatives in Yangquan and other places cannot be shipped in time, affecting the completion of export tasks. More than 40% of the coke produced by the Ximing Mine of the Xishan Mining Bureau in the first half of the year could not be shipped out, posing a huge threat to several major users, including the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry. If the Tangshan Steel Plant had not taken emergency measures in the second quarter to have Anshan Iron and Steel supply part of the coke, it would have shut down long ago. On one day at the end of June, staff members from ten factories in Qiqihar, Xi'an, Shanghai and other places gathered at the Shanxi Provincial People's Committee to urge the shipment of coke. Even more coke will be produced in the second half of the year, but the existing horse-drawn carriage transportation capacity can only transport the coke that was owed in the second quarter.
    This severe transportation bottleneck is caused by the fact that the development of the transportation industry has not kept up with the development of production. From the provincial perspective, the basic construction tasks this year have increased by 147% compared to last year, and the production volume of many factories and mines has also increased significantly. Therefore, the total volume of road transportation and urban handling has also increased by approximately 70% or more compared to last year. However, how the transportation industry can develop accordingly has not been well considered. When issuing plans, the central ministries often only require the completion of more work, and regarding transportation issues, they only send a telegram or make a phone call asking the local authorities to "strongly support," while the local transportation capacity has been greatly reduced. This year, in addition to a slight increase in automobiles, civilian transportation tools have decreased significantly. Civilian transportation tools originally undertook more than 80% of the province's total road transportation and urban handling volume, but after the upsurge of collectivization in the vast rural areas, many civilian transportation tools were mobilized to return to their hometowns. At the end of last year, there were more than 10,000 rubber-wheeled carts participating in transportation, which decreased to more than 7,000 in the first quarter of this year. Iron-wheeled carts also decreased from more than 7,900 to more than 2,500, and the number of pack animals decreased from more than 5,300 to more than 3,500.
    In order to solve the transportation bottleneck problem, the relevant departments of Shanxi Province have received some assistance from the central government on the one hand, and have also taken some measures on the other hand, such as organizing sixty-four cars to operate two shifts every day, stopping the people but not the car, and transporting day and night; organizing some civilian transportation tools and cars from agencies and factories and mines to carry out a sudden transportation rush. These forces are equivalent to adding two hundred cars to each month of the second quarter. However, in the face of the huge transportation task, this part of the force only undertakes a few percent of the total volume of material turnover, and cannot fundamentally change the current passive situation.
    The transportation tasks in Shanxi Province will still be heavy in the third quarter. It is understood that in Taiyuan City alone, half of the construction materials have not found transportation tools in this quarter. Of course, improving the management of the transportation department, repairing roads, and strengthening vehicle maintenance can all complete more transportation tasks. However, due to the excessive transportation tasks, the central link in solving the problem lies in increasing transportation tools. Various places in Shanxi Province are trying to adjust freight rates and find sources of feed to further organize civilian rubber-wheeled vehicles, iron-wheeled vehicles, rickshaws and other transportation tools to solve the difficulties of insufficient transportation capacity in the vast rural areas. However, the heavy urban transportation tasks, especially the transportation of basic construction materials, are beyond the capacity of local solutions alone. This requires adopting different countermeasures based on the size of different factory and mine tasks, the distance from the railway, and the steepness or flatness of the roads, such as organizing horse-drawn carriage transportation, increasing automobiles, or building light railways. This issue, as well as a series of issues involved, such as not being able to buy cars with investment, not having drivers for cars, and not having fodder for horse-drawn carriages, all need to be quickly studied and resolved by the relevant departments of the central government and local authorities.

    赶快解决运输堵塞问题
    本报记者　顾页
    山西省出现了严重的运输堵塞现象。厂矿企业的生产、基本建设工程的施工和人民的日常生活都受到一定的影响。
    在普遍的运输堵塞中，这个号称“煤铁之乡”的省份里，许多矿区积压了大量煤炭运不出去。东山煤矿的职工为了争取今年达到1957年的生产水平，积极增加生产，可是生产出来的煤因运输力不足，储煤量已超过定额数倍，煤堆冒烟，有自燃的危险。西峪煤矿到六月存煤已达七万五千吨。按规定煤堆高不能超过两公尺，这个矿的煤堆却高到二十六公尺。为了避免煤堆自燃焚毁，经上级同意，这个矿已从六月十四日起停止生产。可是，另一方面有些地方却在闹煤荒。在太原市估衣街和郊区义井等煤炭供应点，都几次出现煤炭脱销的情形。太原万柏林区离矿区不远，但这个区域内某些厂矿的伙食单位因为买不到煤，曾经连续几天烧劈柴。劈柴也烧光了的单位只得“停伙”，职工们被迫到市场买熟食吃。
    许多为农民急需的物品，如新式农具、化学肥料、百货等都停留在路上，不能及时供应。从安徽运到原平的红薯秧，由于缺乏交通工具，积压半月后已烂掉了三万多斤。
    一些对全国许多厂矿的生产有很大影响的企业，由于物资被积压，牵累了很多单位。全国二十二个水泥厂，有二十一个依靠太原西山石膏厂供应全部石膏。今年基本建设工地需要大量水泥，水泥厂能不能增产，一个很重要的因素就是看石膏的供应能不能得到满足。尤其是许多工地推广了“干硬性混凝土”，更增加了对石膏的需要。因此，西山石膏厂不只是对二十一个水泥厂的生产有影响，而且还间接地影响着许多基本建设部门的建设速度。但是，西山石膏厂的石膏生产出来后同样运不出去。一至五月份由于缺乏运输工具而没有能从工厂运到车站的石膏达数万吨。六月份各厂和出口要求供应的石膏是一万六千七百八十吨，虽经山西省工业厅在月底从东山煤矿硬抽出十五辆汽车来帮着抢运，仍然有五千多吨没有发运出去。如果按少供应五吨石膏就少产一百吨水泥计算，减产水泥和延缓基本建设速度的损失是十分惊人的。又如阳泉市等地手工业合作社生产的硫磺，也因不能及时发运，影响出口任务的完成。西山矿务局西铭矿生产的焦炭，上半年即有40％以上运不出去，使冶金工业部等几个主要用货户遭受巨大威胁。唐山钢厂在第二季度如果不采取紧急措施，改由鞍钢供应一部分焦炭，早就停产了。六月底的一天，从齐齐哈尔、西安、上海等地十个厂派来的工作人员，一齐聚集在山西省人民委员会催运焦炭。下半年生产的焦炭还要多，而现有的马车运输能力只能把第二季度欠交的焦炭运出来。
    这种严重的运输堵塞现象，是由于交通运输事业的发展赶不上生产的发展而造成的。从全省范围来看，今年的基本建设任务比去年增长了147％，许多厂矿的生产量也大大增加，因此，公路运输和城市搬运总运量也比去年增长约70％以上。但是交通运输事业如何相应地发展却没有很好地考虑。中央各部在下达计划的时候往往只要求完成更多的工作量，对于运输问题，只是一纸电报、一个电话，要地方
  “大力支援”，而地方上的运输力却大大减少了。今年除汽车有少许增加外，民间运输工具都大大减少。民间运输工具原来承担全省公路运输和城市搬运总运量80％以上，但在广大农村掀起合作化高潮以后，许多民间运输工具被动员回乡了。去年年底参加运输的胶轮马车有一万多辆，到今年第一季度减至七千多辆，铁轮车也由七千九百多辆减至二千五百辆，驮力由五千三百多头减至三千五百多头。
    为了解决运输堵塞问题，山西省有关部门一方面得到了中央的一些帮助，另一方面也采取了一些措施，比如组织六十四辆汽车每天开两班，停人不停车，日夜运输；组织一部分民间运输工具和机关厂矿的汽车突击运输。这些力量等于给第二季度每个月增加了两百辆汽车。但是，在庞大的运输任务面前，这部分力量，也只承担了物资周转总量的百分之几，不能根本改变目前的被动局面。
    第三季度山西省的运输任务仍然繁重，据了解，仅太原市在这一季里就有半数建筑器材还没有找到运输工具。当然，改进运输部门的管理工作，整修道路，加强车辆的保养，都可以多完成一些运输任务，不过，由于运输任务太大，解决问题的中心环节，还在于增加运输工具。山西省各地正在设法调整运价，寻找饲草来源，进一步组织民间的胶轮车、铁轮车、人力车等运输工具，来解决广大农村运输力不足的困难。但繁重的城市运输任务；特别是基本建设器材的输送，单靠地方解决则是力不胜任的。这就需要根据不同厂矿任务的大小，离铁道的远近，以及道路的险峻或是平坦，采取组织马车运输，或是增加汽车，或是修建轻便铁道等不同的对策。这个问题以及它所牵连的一系列的问题，比如有了投资买不来汽车，有了汽车没有司机，有了马车没有草料等等，都需要中央和地方的有关部门迅速研究解决。
