Product Quality Review

    Which brands of batteries are good? Which brands of batteries are bad?
    The Five Rams brand batteries from Guangzhou Xinghua Battery Factory, the Big Gong brand batteries from Wuhan Battery Factory, and the Shunfeng brand batteries from Shanghai Dehe Battery Factory and the Golden Mouse brand batteries from Shanghai Huaming Battery Factory are all of relatively good quality. Their common advantages are: voltage and current meet standards; continuous discharge time is long; they do not leak electricity and can be stored for a relatively long time.
    The Five Rams brand batteries from Guangxi Wuzhou Xinghua Battery Factory, the New Chongqing brand batteries from Chongqing Hualai Battery Factory, and the August 1st brand batteries from Henan Anyang Liming Battery Factory are of relatively poor quality. Their common disadvantage is: serious leakage. According to consumer feedback: using them for one hour a day, they run out of power in three to five days. Moreover, the zinc skin of the battery is easily corroded, and the chemicals inside often leak out.

    什么牌子的电池好？什么牌子的电池不好？
    广州兴华电池厂的五羊牌电池，武汉电池厂的大公牌电池，还有上海德和电池厂的顺风牌电池和上海华明电池厂的金鼠牌电池，质量都是比较好的。它们的共同优点是：电压电流合乎标准；连续放电的时间较长；不会跑电，可以存放得比较久。
    广西梧州兴华电池厂的五羊牌电池，重庆华来电池厂的新重庆牌电池，河南安阳黎明电池厂的八一牌电池，质量比较差。它们的共同缺点是：跑电较严重。据消费者反映：每天用一个小时，用不了三、五天就没电了。而且电池锌皮很容易被腐蚀，里面的药物经常流出来。                      （丁宁真）
