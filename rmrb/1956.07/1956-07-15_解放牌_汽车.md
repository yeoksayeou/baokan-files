    "Liberation" Brand Automobile
    Xinhua News Agency Reporter Ren Bingru
    The domestically produced "Liberation" brand automobile, which the people of the whole country have been eagerly awaiting, has been trial-produced at the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant on the eve of the plant's third anniversary. After necessary road tests and the completion of various preparations for starting production, this automobile will begin mass production from September onwards.
    For a long time, our country has been a "world automobile exhibition hall," having used more than 130 brands of automobiles, but none of them were manufactured by our own country. However, from now on, the people of the whole country can see the domestically produced "Liberation" brand automobile running on the land of the motherland.
    The Liberation brand automobile is a general-purpose truck. This dark green medium-sized truck is equipped with a 90-horsepower, six-cylinder gasoline engine, has a load capacity of four tons, and is suitable for factories, farms, and various transportation departments to load industrial products, raw materials, construction materials, ore, and agricultural products. The maximum speed of this automobile is 65 kilometers per hour, and the economical speed when fully loaded is 30 to 35 kilometers per hour, which is more suitable for the current highway trunk lines and bridge load conditions in our country. If it is driven in the vast plains of Northeast and North China, it has enough power to tow one or two trailers, increasing the carrying capacity by about one time. The body of this automobile is short, and the chassis is high, so it can run on the highways in the Kangzang Plateau and the mountainous areas of Southwest and Northwest China. If high off-road tires are installed, it can also pass unimpeded on general dirt roads. It uses compressed air brakes, which are more convenient and flexible, and can fully guarantee driving safety.
    The Liberation brand automobile is based on the Soviet ZIS-150 automobile, which has been used by our users for many years, and some structures have been improved according to the road conditions and usage conditions in our country. The whole vehicle is composed of about 2,600 kinds of 11,000 parts. It fully retains the advantages of the ZIS-150 automobile. Therefore, it is superior in terms of performance and economy.
    The Liberation brand automobile is also a kind of automobile with a solid structure and a long service life. It is manufactured according to formal process standards and modern production technology. Many easily worn parts adopt advanced processing methods, thus strengthening its robustness and durability, and also making it easy to maintain and service. In addition, according to the development of our country's fuel industry, this automobile can also use low-grade gasoline or mixed gasoline that is widely used in our country, and the fuel consumption is lower than the current quota of the transportation department.
    With the development of our country's transportation construction, the Liberation brand automobile, this convenient means of transportation, has extremely broad uses. Many remote places that cannot be reached by airplanes, ships, and trains can be tasked to the automobile to connect the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas, and promote the development of industrial and agricultural production. After various factories, enterprises, and construction sites have this modern transportation tool, in addition to using it to undertake increasingly busy transportation tasks, they can also modify this truck into various special-purpose modified vehicles according to needs. Such as buses, refueling vehicles, water transport vehicles, dump trucks, crane trucks, engineering vehicles, refrigerated trucks, snowplow trucks, gas generator vehicles, compressed gas vehicles, compressed air vehicles, special tractor vehicles, closed box trucks, etc. These special vehicles can be modified or added with some equipment on the basis of the original vehicle structure, and can exert different uses to meet the different needs of people in production and life.
    In the process of compiling the technical task book and trial-producing this new type of truck, the designers and technicians of the First Automobile Factory not only widely solicited users' opinions, but also collected samples of similar trucks from various countries for analysis and comparison. They considered that no brand of automobile could completely meet the requirements of various regions in our country with such a vast territory. Therefore, the designers are taking effective measures according to the climate, road conditions, and industrial development level of various parts of our country to gradually make the Liberation brand automobile completely suitable for the conditions in our country.

    “解放牌”汽车
    新华社记者　任冰如
    全国人民盼望已久的国产“解放牌”汽车，已经在第一汽车制造厂建厂三周年前夕试制出来了。这种汽车经过必要的行车试验和完成开工生产各种准备工作以后，将从九月份以后开始大量生产。
    我们的国家长期是一个“万国汽车的展览馆”，先后使用过一百三十多种厂牌的汽车，可是没有一种是我国自己制造的。但是，从现在开始，全国人民可以看到国产的“解放牌”汽车在祖国的大地上奔驰了。
    解放牌汽车是一种通用性的载重汽车。这种深绿色的中型卡车，装有九十马力、六个汽缸的汽油发动机，载重量为四吨，适合于工厂、农场和各个交通运输部门装载工业产品、原材料、建筑器材、矿石和农产品用。这种汽车的最大车速为每小时六十五公里，满载时经济时速为三十公里到三十五公里，比较适合于我国现有公路干线和桥梁负荷等条件。如在我国东北和华北广阔的平原地区行驶，还有足够力量牵引一个到两个拖车，增加载运量一倍左右。这种汽车的车身短，底盘高，能在我国康藏高原和西南、西北等山区的公路上行驶，如果装上高越野性轮胎，也可在一般土路上通行无阻。它采用压缩空气刹车，比较方便灵活，完全可以保证行车的安全。
    解放牌汽车，是以我国用户使用多年的苏联吉斯150型汽车为范本，并且根据我国公路条件和使用条件改进了部分结构。全车由约二千六百种、一万一千件零件组成。它完全保留了吉斯150汽车的优点。因此，在使用性能和经济性能上都是比较优越的。
    解放牌汽车也是结构坚固，使用寿命长的一种汽车。它是按照正规的工艺标准和现代生产技术来制造的。许多易磨损的零件，都采用了先进的工艺方法，因此加强了它的坚固耐用性，同时也便于维护和保养。另外，根据我国燃料工业发展情况，这种汽车还可以使用低级汽油或采用我国大量使用的混合汽油，耗油量比交通部门现行定额还低。
    随着我国交通建设事业的发展，解放牌汽车这种轻便的交通工具，有着极为广阔的用途。许多飞机、轮船、火车所不能到达的偏僻地方，汽车就可以担负起沟通城乡物资交流的任务，促进工农业生产的发展。各个工厂、企业和建筑工地，拥有这种现代化的交通运输工具以后，除了利用它来担负日益繁忙的运输任务以外，还可以根据需要把这种载重汽车改装成为适合各种特殊用途的变型汽车。如公共汽车，加油汽车，运水汽车，倾卸汽车，起重汽车，工程汽车，冷藏汽车，推雪汽车，煤气发生炉车，压缩煤气车，压缩空气车，专用牵引汽车，闭式车箱载重汽车等。这些专用车是在原来汽车结构的基础上加以改装或增加一些设备，就可发挥不同的用途，满足人们在生产和生活方面不同的需要。
    第一汽车厂的设计人员和工艺人员在编制技术任务书和试制这种新型载重汽车的过程中，除了广泛地征求了用户的意见外，同时也搜集了各国同级载重汽车标本进行了分析比较，他们考虑到任何一种牌号的汽车，都不可能完全适合我国这样幅员广大的国家的各个地区的要求。因此，设计人员根据我国各地的气候、道路等条件以及工业发展水平，正在采取有效措施，使解放牌汽车逐步完全适合我国的情况。
