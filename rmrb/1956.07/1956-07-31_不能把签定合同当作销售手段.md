Signing Contracts Should Not Be Used as a Sales Tactic
    Qian Minyi

In Jiangsu Province, some supply and marketing cooperatives and agricultural cooperatives have signed various contracts, but they do not conscientiously implement them, causing great losses to the agricultural cooperatives.

Before the summer harvest, the Miaotou District Central Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Shuyang County signed contracts with some agricultural cooperatives in the district to supply agricultural tools. The contract stipulated that the tools should be of good quality and quantity, and supplied in a timely manner. Therefore, the members of the agricultural cooperative were very relieved, thinking that they would not have to worry about the agricultural tools for this year's wheat harvest. When the summer harvest season arrived, the various outlets of the supply and marketing cooperative transported all kinds of agricultural tools to the agricultural cooperative, and the members were very happy. However, upon closer inspection, the quality of the agricultural tools delivered was very poor. The wheat forks were only as thick as fingers, a foot long, and crooked beyond recognition. The noses of the hoes were crooked and small, making it impossible to install the hoe handles; the sickles also had many defects. Later, the agricultural cooperative had to return these unsuitable agricultural tools to the supply and marketing cooperative.

The supply and marketing cooperative did not implement the contract at all, and did not supply the goods on time. The Guangming Agricultural Cooperative in Zhaimen Township, Wuxi County, planted sixty mu of cantaloupe and watermelon this year. At the end of April, the cooperative ordered manure from the Zhaimen Supply and Marketing Cooperative, planning to use it as top dressing for the melon fields. The Zhaimen Supply and Marketing Cooperative asked the District Supply and Marketing Cooperative for instructions. The District Supply and Marketing Cooperative said that they did have manure, but they required cash payment for the order within three days, or it would be forfeited. The Guangming Agricultural Cooperative tried various ways to raise 125 yuan and gave it to the supply and marketing cooperative, signing a contract; after receiving the money, the supply and marketing cooperative said that it would transport 3,400 dan of manure by the end of May. The members waited eagerly for more than a month, and the time for fertilization was almost over, but the supply and marketing cooperative still had not transported the manure. Helplessly, the Guangming Agricultural Cooperative had to use the cake fertilizer prepared for rice fields in the melon fields.

The failure of these supply and marketing cooperatives to implement the contracts has aroused dissatisfaction among the local farmers. Lin Zhenxi, a member of the Guanzhuang Agricultural Cooperative in Shuyang County, said, "I will never be fooled by the supply and marketing cooperative again. They say nice things, but they can't do it."

Why don't the supply and marketing cooperatives implement the contracts? There are certainly many reasons, but a fundamental reason is that some staff members of the supply and marketing cooperatives regard signing contracts as a means to complete sales plans. Once the contract is signed and the money is in hand, they don't care whether the agricultural cooperative can get good quality goods on time according to the contract.

### 不能把签定合同当作销售手段

    不能把签定合同当作销售手段
    钱敏谊
    江苏省有一部分供销社和农业社签订了各种合同，但却不认真执行合同，使农业社受到很大损失。
    沭阳县庙头区中心供销社在夏收以前，就和这个区的一部分农业社签订了供应农具的合同。合同上规定要包质包量，供应及时。因此，农业社的社员们都很放心，以为今年麦收用的农具不用发愁了。夏收时节一到，供销社的各门市部把各种农具都运到农业社来了，社员们都很高兴。可是仔细一看，运来的农具质量都很差，麦叉只有手指那么粗，尺把长，歪得不像样子。锄头的鼻子又歪又小，没法安装锄柄；镰刀也有很多缺点。后来，农业社只好把这些不适用的农具又退还给供销社。
    供销社根本不执行合同，到期不供货。无锡县寨门乡光明农业社今年种了六十亩香瓜、西瓜，四月底，社里就向寨门供销社订购大粪，准备给瓜田作追肥。寨门供销社请示了区供销社。区供销社说，大粪倒有，就是要在三天内付现款订货，过期不候。光明农业社从多方面想办法，凑足了一百二十五元钱，交给供销社，订了合同；供销社得到了款子后，说要在五月底才能运到三千四百担大粪。社员眼巴巴盼望了一个多月，施肥的时间快过去了，供销社还是没有把大粪运来，没奈何，光明农业社只好把准备垩水稻的饼肥，用到瓜田里去。
    这些供销社不执行合同的行为，已引起当地农民的不满。沭阳县官庄农业社社员林振喜说：“下次再也不上供销社的当了，说的好听，就是做不到。”
    供销社为什么不执行呢？原因当然很多，但有个根本原因，那就是有些供销社的工作人员，把签订合同作为完成销售计划的一种手段，合同订好了，钱到手了，至于农业社能不能按照合同及时拿到质量好的货，就不是他们所关心的了。
