Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi, July 12th: The Chinese Communist Party organizations are developing rapidly in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region.

Currently, there are more than 68,000 Party members in the entire autonomous region, comprising thirteen ethnic groups within the region. Among them, 34,024 have been newly developed in the six years since liberation. They are all outstanding individuals from among workers, farmers, and government cadres. Recently, another group of senior intellectuals has been accepted into the Party. More than 2,500 grassroots Party organizations have been established in rural areas, factories, mines, enterprises, government offices, and schools. Party organizations have been established in 90% of the townships in vast rural areas, and Party organizations have also begun to be established in pastoral areas.

With the improvement of the level of Party member cadres, the proportion of local ethnic minority Party members in the leading bodies of Party organizations at all levels in the autonomous region has increased. According to statistics at the end of 1955, local ethnic minority members accounted for 41.7% of the total number of members in the district committee, county committee, prefectural committee, and autonomous region party committee. After the election of new committees by Party congresses at all levels in the first half of this year, the number of local ethnic minority members has further increased, and some have reached more than half.

Party organizations in various places have paid special attention to the work of consolidating organizations in their development work. In addition to educating Party members in Party life, Party organizations have adopted methods such as organizing Party lessons and running training courses for new Party members and branch secretaries, as well as conducting universal Party rectification to strengthen the education of Party members.

    新疆各族共产党员达六万八千多名
    本地民族党员在各级党组织领导机构中的比例已达半数左右
    新华社乌鲁木齐12日电　　中共党组织在新疆维吾尔自治区有迅速发展。
    现在全自治区共有六万八千多名党员，包括了自治区内十三个民族成份，其中有三万四千零二十四名是在解放后六年多来新发展的。他们都是工人、农民、机关干部中间的优秀分子。最近另有一批高级知识分子被接受入党。在农村、工矿、企业、机关和学校中已先后建立了二千五百多个党的基层组织，在广大农村中90％的乡已建立了党的组织，牧区也已开始建立党的组织。
    随着党员干部水平的提高，在自治区各级党组织的领导机构中，本地各民族党员的比例有了增长。据1955年底的统计，在区委、县委、地委和自治区党委的委员中，本地各民族的委员占委员总数的41.7％。今年上半年各级党代表大会选举了新委员会之后，本地各民族委员又有了增加，有的已达到半数以上。
    各地党组织在发展工作中特别注意了巩固组织的工作。党组织除了在党的生活中教育党员外，并采用了组织上党课和开办新党员训练班、支部书记训练班以及普遍整党等办法加强对党员的教育。
