    Success and Failure: What is the Key?
    Wang Yonghuai

    Immediately after the heavy rain, cadres and members of the Fangjiapu and Xihe agricultural cooperatives in Xingtai County, Hebei Province, rushed to Miaonangou and Gaoyugou respectively to inspect the soil and water conservation projects in these two gullies. After the test of the heavy rain, the Xihe cooperative's project played its due role, but the Fangjiapu cooperative's project failed.

    This spring, the Fangjiapu and Xihe cooperatives carried out soil and water conservation projects in Miaonangou and Gaoyugou on the east and north sides of Phoenix Mountain, which is 800 meters above sea level. The Fangjiapu agricultural cooperative, neglecting the principle of comprehensive management, only built several check dams in the gully and reclaimed 20 mu of terraced fields, and planted crops along the edges of the fields with soil ridges, thinking that this would protect the farmland.

    The Xihe cooperative took a different approach. They carried out comprehensive management in Gaoyugou. Members dug pits and planted trees in the 1,500 mu large gully, built 280 dams in the tributary and main gullies, reclaimed 80 mu of terraced fields, planted crops and trees on the terraced fields, built tree platforms under each tree, built soil ridges for each piece of cultivated land, and built a small reservoir at a narrow gully mouth.

    On May 31, there was a heavy rain. The rainwater on the slopes of Miaonangou converged into the gully. The water in the terraced fields was full, and 8 of the 12 dams were washed away. The flood flowed to the east of Fangjiapu Village and washed away 7 grain trucks loaded with grain, resulting in the loss of a lot of grain.

    The situation in Gaoyugou was very different. The tree pits, orchard platforms, and small reservoir were all filled with water, and the 280 stone dams played the role of slowing down the flood and retaining sediment. The members said happily: "Gaoyugou has stood the test!"

    The same treatment of gullies, one success and one failure, the lessons learned are worth noting. It tells us that carrying out soil and water conservation work in mountainous areas cannot be done in isolation, but must clarify the purpose and comprehensively manage, so as to achieve afforestation of every mountain, dams in every gully, ridges on cultivated land, and pits for every tree. Only in this way can we achieve "floods become slow, slow water enters the reservoir, half of the rainwater falling on the mountain is retained, the soil in the terraced fields does not leave the field, and the floods in the gullies do not enter the Sichuan".

    一成一败，关键何在？
    王永淮
    暴雨刚过，河北邢台县放甲铺和西河两个农业合作社的干部和社员便分头跑到庙南沟和高峪沟，检查这两条沟的水土保持工程。经过暴雨的考验，西河社的工程发挥了应有的效益，放甲铺社的工程却失败了。
    今年春天，放甲铺社和西河社在拔海800公尺的凤凰山的东侧和北侧，分别进行庙南沟和高峪沟的水土保持工程。放甲铺农业社由于忽略了综合治理的原则，仅仅在沟内闸沟垫地，打了几道拦沟坝，修了梯田20亩，在地边打了土埂种了庄稼，以为这样农田就有保障了。
    西河社的作法不同，他们在高峪沟进行了综合治理。社员们在1，500亩的大沟中挖坑栽树，在支沟、干沟打了280道坝，修了梯田80亩，在梯田上种了庄稼栽了树，每棵树下都修了树坪，每块耕地都打了土埂，并在一个肚大口小的沟口上修了一座小型水库。
    五月三十一日，降了一场暴雨。庙南沟山坡上的雨水都集中到沟内，梯田地里的水满了，12道坝被冲坏了8道，洪水流到放甲铺村东，把满载粮食的运粮车冲走了7辆。损失了不少粮食。
    高峪沟的情形大不相同。树坑里、果树坪和小型水库里都积满了水，280道石坝起了缓洪拦沙的作用。社员们都高兴地说：“高峪沟经得起考验了！”
    同样是治理沟壑，一个成功，一个失败，其中的经验教训值得注意。它告诉我们，开展山区水土保持工作，不能孤立地进行，必须明确目的，全面治理，要做到山山绿化，沟沟有坝，耕地有埂，树树有坑。这样才能达到“洪水变缓，缓水入库，落山雨水留一半，梯田泥土不出田，沟谷洪水不入川”。
