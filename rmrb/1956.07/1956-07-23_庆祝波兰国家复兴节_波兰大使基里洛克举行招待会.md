Premier Zhou Enlai, at the grand reception held by Polish Ambassador Kirilocek tonight to celebrate the twelfth anniversary of Polish National Revival Day, extended warm congratulations to the Polish government and the Polish people on behalf of the Chinese government and the Chinese people.

Poland's economic construction has been greatly developed. At the same time, the Polish people are playing an increasingly important role in the cause of defending world peace, and have made significant contributions to consolidating peace in Korea and Indochina. The efforts made by the Polish people to safeguard world peace are deeply supported by peace-loving countries and people all over the world. The Chinese people, with excitement, closely follow every achievement made by the fraternal Polish people in the cause of building socialism and in the struggle for world peace, and are encouraged by these achievements.

Premier Zhou Enlai finally proposed: To the prosperity and strength of the Polish People's Republic, to the deepening brotherly friendship between the Chinese and Polish people, to world peace, and to the health of the leaders of the Polish United Workers' Party and the government of the Polish People's Republic, a toast!

Before Premier Zhou Enlai spoke, Ambassador Kirilocek delivered a speech. He said that Poland has achieved tremendous economic development in the past twelve years. Poland's industrial output has now increased fivefold compared to pre-war levels.

He said that the friendship and brotherly cooperation between Poland and the People's Republic of China, the Soviet Union, and other friendly countries are a good guarantee for the further development of socialist construction in Poland.

He said that the Polish People's Republic hopes to cooperate with all countries in the world, regardless of their social systems, on the basis of mutual respect for sovereignty and economic interests. The Polish people, who suffered enormous losses in World War II, are actively fighting to strengthen peace and to resolutely oppose all attempts to provoke relations between countries. The Polish people warmly sympathize with the people of all countries who are struggling for national and social independence.

He said that the Polish people pay close attention to the great social and economic transformation movement taking place in fraternal China. The Polish people feel as happy about the achievements of the Chinese people as they do about their own achievements. The Polish people wish the Chinese people greater achievements in political, economic, and cultural life.
