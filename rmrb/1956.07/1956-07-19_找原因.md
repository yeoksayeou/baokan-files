Finding the Reason
    Ding Jing
    When people encounter problems in their work that need to be resolved, they must understand the situation, find the cause, and learn from the experience to avoid repeating mistakes. However, some people often fail to find the real reason.
    Since the Yunnan Brick and Tile Factory started production, it has failed to complete its tasks for two consecutive years. In recent months, workers' absenteeism has become increasingly frequent. The leadership spent a great deal of effort analyzing and researching, and finally, with great difficulty, found the reason in the workers: students from Wenshan, carrying the shortcomings of intellectuals, have many problems and are not dedicated to their work; those from the Kunming Orphanage have old habits that are difficult to change and are not easy to educate; and those who came through labor placement have even more complex problems. The majority left are from rural areas and have very serious peasant thinking. In addition, during the factory's union re-election this spring, the workers raised many opinions to the leadership, creating a situation of "extreme democratization," which caused the Party and the administration's prestige among the masses to "suffer great losses." As a result, absenteeism continued to occur. Based on this analysis, the Yunnan Brick and Tile Factory's leadership concluded that the long-term failure to complete production tasks should be the responsibility of the workers, and decided to adopt the form of struggle sessions to conduct an education on labor discipline for the workers, giving them a good rectification.
    The workers of the Yunnan Brick and Tile Factory were also looking for the reason. Now, let us look at the workers' opinions:
      "Since the beginning of this year, the phenomenon of absenteeism in our factory has become more serious month by month: 256 people were absent in January, 313 in February, 495 in March, and it increased to 677 in April. This is indeed a very dishonorable thing.
    Why is there so much absenteeism? We feel that while the comrades who are absent are at fault, the leadership also bears a great responsibility.
    For example, in January of this year, the Party branch secretary called on employees to work overtime to complete the plan. Originally, our work was mostly physical labor, and with overtime, many workers collapsed from exhaustion. The number of sick people increased in February, and some people were not allowed sick leave. When they physically couldn't bear it, they were absent from work. Who should be responsible for this kind of absenteeism? ... Especially for workers who are paid on a piece-rate basis, management is often chaotic, failing to meet the quota, reducing wage income, and some people become angry and unwilling to go to work."
    Here, two analyses have found two different reasons. From the workers' analysis, the real reason for the Yunnan Brick and Tile Factory's failure to complete production tasks and the serious phenomenon of absenteeism lies in the leadership's chaotic management, violation of labor protection regulations, blindly working overtime, damaging workers' health, and affecting workers' enthusiasm. It is not entirely like what the leadership said, that the workers' composition is complex and they do not obey the leadership, etc. I am not prepared to spend a lot of space here to investigate the reasons why this factory has been unable to complete its production tasks for a long time, because there are many reasons for investigation. In addition to the reasons pointed out by the workers, perhaps the production plan is not practical, perhaps the labor organization is improperly allocated, perhaps the production equipment conditions are not good, perhaps the political work is too weak ... etc. In short, no matter how many reasons there are, the leadership has an inescapable responsibility. In particular, the leadership has a major responsibility for not going deep into the masses for a long time, understanding the situation, finding the key to the problem, and thus seeking a solution.
    Under the situation of high tides in industrial production, many factories have completed their production tasks very well, but some factories have not completed their production tasks very well. Some factories, like the Yunnan Brick and Tile Factory, often work overtime and often look for reasons, but the result is often getting worse. I think the leaders of these factories should quickly come out of their offices and find the real reasons with the workers and masses, learn from the lessons, and avoid repeating the mistakes.
    Subjectivism, bureaucracy, and separation from the masses will not find the real reasons or reverse the backward situation.

    找原因
    丁井
    人们在工作上遇到问题需要求得解决的时候，就得了解情况，寻找原因，吸取教训，以免重蹈复辙。可是，有的人常常找不到真正的原因所在。
    云南砖瓦厂自开工生产以来，一连两年完不成任务。最近几个月工人旷工缺勤的事愈来愈多。领导上花了很大的力气分析研究，最后，好容易在工人身上找到了原因：来自文山的学生，带着知识分子的缺点，问题多，不安心工作；从昆明市孤儿院来的，旧习难改，不好教育；劳动就业来的，问题更加复杂。剩下大部农村来的，农民思想很严重。加上今年春间工厂改选工会的时候，工人们给领导上提了很多意见，造成“极端民主化”的情况，使党和行政在群众中的威信“受到很大的损失”。于是，旷工缺勤的现象就不断发生。根据这个分析，云南砖瓦厂的领导肯定长期完不成生产任务应该由工人负责，并且决定采用斗争大会的形式，对工人进行一次整顿劳动纪律的教育，把他们好好地整一下。
    云南砖瓦厂的工人们也在那里寻找原因，现在，让我们再看看工人的意见：
      “今年以来，我们厂里旷工、缺勤的现象一个月比一个月严重：一月份旷工256人，二月份有313人，三月份495人，到四月份增加到677人，这实在是一件非常不光荣的事情。
    为什么旷工这么多呢？我们觉得，旷工的同志本身固然有错误，但领导上也要负很大的责任。
    像今年一月份，党总支书记号召职工加班加点完成计划，本来，我们的工作大都是体力劳动，再一加班加点，许多工人都累倒了。二月份病号增加，有的人请不准病假，身体实在支持不住，就旷工了。试问这种旷工应当由谁来负责呢？……特别是拿计件工资的工人，往往由于管理混乱，达不到定额，减少了工资收入，有的人一生气就不愿上班了。”
    这里，两种分析，找出了两种不同的原因，从工人们的分析看来，云南砖瓦厂完不成生产任务和旷工、缺勤现象严重的真正原因在于领导上的管理混乱，违犯劳动保护规程，一味加班加点，损害工人健康，影响工人的积极性。并不完全像领导上所说的工人成分复杂，不服从领导等等。我不准备在这里花很大的篇幅去追查这个厂长期不能完成生产任务的原因，因为追查起来原因很多，除了工人们指出的原因以外，也许生产计划不切合实际，也许劳动组织调配不当，也许生产设备条件不好，也许政治工作太弱……等等，总之，不论有多少原因，领导上都有不可推卸的责任。特别是长期来没有深入群众，了解情况，寻找关键所在，从而求得解决的办法，领导上不能不负有重大责任。
    在工业生产高涨的形势下，有不少的工厂生产任务完成得很好，但也有些工厂的生产任务完成得很不好。有的厂和云南砖瓦厂一样经常加班加点，也经常找寻原因，其结果也常常是愈来愈糟。我看，这些厂的领导人应该赶快从办公室里走出来，同工人群众一起找寻真正的原因，接受教训，以免重蹈复辙。
    主观主义、官僚主义、脱离群众是不会找到真正的原因、扭转落后局面的。
