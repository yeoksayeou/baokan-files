Since the opening of the Qinghai-Tibet and Kangding-Tibet highways, state-owned commercial departments have successively established trade organizations in major towns such as Lhasa, Qamdo, Xigaze, Gyangze, Yadong, and Ali, which have played a significant role in promoting the development of commerce in Tibet and invigorating the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas. In recent years, the amount of goods imported into Tibet has increased, with 1954 being 120 if 1953 is taken as 100, and 1955 being 140. Before liberation, Zhamu only had some itinerant merchants, but by the end of 1955, there were already eighty-two businesses. The number of businesses in Qamdo, Lhasa, and other places has also increased by more than one to two times compared to before liberation. This has effectively guaranteed the needs of the Tibetan people. The Lhasa Trade General Company has supplied large quantities of steel, electrical materials, and medical equipment needed for local production in recent years. In Qamdo, Bomi, Taizhao and other places along the Kangding-Tibet highway, mobile trade teams were also organized to supply the needs of road construction troops and laborers. Whenever the laborers had holidays, they would happily buy tea, sugar, cloth, soap and other items to take home.

Tea is an indispensable daily necessity for the Tibetan people. In order to meet this need, with the improvement of transportation conditions, the supply of tea from the interior to Tibet has increased year by year. If 1952 is taken as 100, it was 449.1 in 1955, and this year it will reach 692.31, exceeding the highest year of tea import to Tibet in history by 7.14%, basically satisfying the Tibetan people's need for tea. The price of tea has also gradually decreased. For example, the current price of brick tea in Lhasa is 16.27% lower than in the early days of liberation.

State-owned trading companies also entrusted merchants to purchase large quantities of local specialties. In 1954, Qamdo purchased anemarrhena, fritillaria, cordyceps and other medicinal materials worth more than 400,000 yuan through merchants. In 1955, the total value of local specialties purchased reached 1.46 million yuan. The prices have also increased compared to before liberation. Before liberation, 100 catties of wool could only be exchanged for three and a half bottles of tea, but now it can be exchanged for twenty bottles. Before liberation, one catty of anemarrhena sold for two yuan, but now it sells for eight yuan. The income of herdsmen has increased. Some Tibetans who used to lack food and clothing have sewn serge clothes, and some have put on gold-rimmed hats. In the suburbs of Qamdo, more than 100 households have built or purchased houses because of the profits from producing local products.

This year, the Tibet Trade General Company will vigorously organize sources of goods and supply the Tibetan people according to their needs, in order to further satisfy their needs.

    把越来越多的货物供应西藏
    李玉璞
    青藏、康藏公路通车以后，国营商业部门在拉萨、昌都、日喀则、江孜、亚东、阿里等主要城镇，都先后建立了贸易机构，对促进西藏商业的发展和活跃城乡物资交流，起了很大作用。几年来输入西藏的物资，如以1953年为100，1954年为120，1955年就为140。扎木在解放以前，仅有一些流动行商，到1955年底已有八十二家商户了。昌都、拉萨等地的商户也比解放前增加了一倍多到两倍。因此有力地保证了西藏人民的需要。拉萨贸易总公司，几年来供应了当地生产需用的大批钢铁、电料、医疗器材等。在康藏公路沿线的昌都、波密、太昭等地，还组织了流动贸易小组，供应修路部队和民工的需要。每当民工放假的时候，他们都欢欣地购买茶叶、糖、布、肥皂等物品带回家去。
    茶叶是西藏人民日常生活不可缺少的生活资料，为了满足他们这种需要，随着交通条件的改善，内地供应西藏的茶叶，一年比一年增加了。如以1952年为100，1955年则为449.1，今年将达到692.31，比历史上输入西藏的茶叶最高的一年，还超过7.14％，基本上满足了藏族人民对茶叶的需要。茶价也逐步降低了，如拉萨现在的砖茶价格比解放初期降低了16.27％。
    国营贸易公司还委托商人大量收购土特产品。昌都在1954年通过商人收购的知母、贝母、虫草等药材，价值四十多万元，1955年收购的土特产品的总值达146万元。在价格方面也比解放前提高了，解放前，一百斤羊毛只换三瓶半茶叶，现在可以换二十瓶了。解放前一斤知母卖两元钱，现在卖八元。牧民收入增加了，过去缺吃少穿的藏民，有的缝制了哔叽衣服，有的戴上了镶金边的帽子。在昌都城郊，由于生产土产品获利而建造或购置房屋的就有一百多家。
    今年，西藏贸易总公司，将根据西藏人民的需要，大力组织货源，供应西藏人民，进一步满足他们的需要。
