Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, July 9th. The first batch of switchboard instruments produced by the Harbin Electric Meter Instrument Factory were shipped to mines, construction projects, and electrical factories in Anshan, Shenyang, Xi'an, Tianjin and other places in early July.

Since the successful trial production of switchboard instruments on May 1st, the workers have quickly mastered the instrument manufacturing and assembly technology after more than a month of trial production, and quickly switched to mass production. In the beginning, on the assembly line of the 201-type instrument assembly section, it took more than twenty minutes to assemble an instrument. Since July, an instrument can be assembled on average every four minutes, and the quality has also been improved.

    哈尔滨电表仪器厂首批开关板仪表出厂
    据新华社哈尔滨9日电　哈尔滨电表仪器厂生产的第一批开关板仪表，七月初陆续运往鞍山、沈阳、西安、天津等地的矿山、建设工程和电气工厂。
    这个厂自从五月一日试制成功开关板仪表以来，经过一个多月的试生产，工人们较快地掌握了仪表制造和装配技术，迅速地转入了成批生产。开始一个时期，二零一型仪表装配工段的装配传送带上，需要隔二十多分钟才能装出一只仪表。七月份以来，平均每隔四分多钟就能装出了一只仪表，而且质量也提高了。
