Xinhua News Agency, July 30th: TASS reports: The "Letter to All Agricultural Workers and Working People of Kazakhstan" adopted by the Soviet Kazakh Republic Agricultural Workers Conference announced that the participants of the meeting unanimously decided to respond to the challenge of the socialist competition launched by the agricultural laborers of Siberia, and called on all agricultural laborers of Kazakhstan to launch a competition to strive to sell ten billion poods of grain to the state ahead of schedule this year.

The conference was held in Alma-Ata from July 27th to 28th. During the conference, Zhurin, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Kazakhstan, said that with the active support of the entire Soviet people, the agricultural laborers of Kazakhstan have smoothly completed the task of cultivating new land. Among the reclaimed wasteland, 18 million hectares will be harvested this year. The grain sowing area exceeds 23 million hectares, of which wheat accounts for 18 million hectares. There is every reason to believe that Kazakhstan can harvest at least 1.4 billion poods of grain and provide at least 1 billion poods of grain to the state.

Nikita Khrushchev, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, participated in the conference and spoke at the meeting.

In his speech, Khrushchev focused on some issues concerning the further development of agriculture in the Kazakh Republic and increasing the production of agricultural products.

He said, "You have undertaken the task of providing ten billion poods of grain. This is something that cannot but be gratifying and cannot but be a matter of pride. Because not long ago, everyone believed that Kazakhstan was a backward republic in terms of grain production and that its potential in this regard was not great. But now everyone sees that fundamental changes have taken place in just two years. The collective farms and state farms of Kazakhstan used to provide only tens of millions of poods of grain to the state each year, but this year it can hand over ten billion poods. In terms of the quantity of grain produced, Kazakhstan now ranks second only to the Russian Federation, pushing Ukraine to third place. It will be difficult for Ukraine to exceed third place now, because its cultivated land area is not as large as Kazakhstan's."

Khrushchev pointed out that due to its huge potential, the grain we can harvest this year will not only be able to meet current needs, but also can be stored in large quantities. If we achieve this goal, then as long as the harvest is good next year, the state may reduce the amount of grain purchased from collective farms. In this way, collective farms will have more favorable conditions for developing animal husbandry.

    苏联哈萨克农业工作人员会议发出号召
    今年向国家交售十亿普特粮食
    赫鲁晓夫谈进一步发展农业等问题
    新华社30日讯　据塔斯社报道：苏联哈萨克共和国农业工作人员会议通过的告哈萨克全体农业工作人员和劳动人民书宣布，会议的参加者一致决定响应西伯利亚农业劳动者展开社会主义竞赛的挑战，并且号召哈萨克全体农业劳动者展开竞赛，争取在今年提前向国家交售十亿普特粮食。
    这次会议是七月二十七日到二十八日在阿拉木图举行的。会议期间，哈萨克共产党中央委员会书记茹林说，哈萨克农业劳动者在全体苏联人民的积极支持下，顺利地完成了开垦新土地的任务。在开垦的荒地中，有一千八百万公顷今年就可以获得收成。谷物播种面积超过了二千三百万公顷，其中小麦占一千八百万公顷。完全有理由可以相信，哈萨克至少能够收获十四亿普特谷物，至少可以向国家提供十亿普特粮食。
    苏联共产党中央委员会第一书记赫鲁晓夫参加了这次会议，并且在会上讲了话。
    赫鲁晓夫在讲话中着重谈到了进一步发展哈萨克共和国的农业，增加农产品生产方面的一些问题。
    他说，你们承担了提供十亿普特粮食的任务。这是不能不令人高兴的，不能不引以为豪的。因为就在不久以前，大家还认为哈萨克在生产谷物方面是一个落后的共和国，认为它在这方面的潜力不大。然而现在大家看到，只是两年时间就发生了根本变化。哈萨克的集体农庄和国营农场过去每年只向国家提供几千万普特谷物，而今年它就可以交出十亿普特。按生产谷物的数量来说，哈萨克现在仅次于俄罗斯联邦而居第二位，它把乌克兰挤到第三位去了。乌克兰现在很难再超过第三位了，因为它的耕地面积没有哈萨克那么大。
    赫鲁晓夫指出，由于有着巨大的潜能，今年我们可以收到的粮食不仅能够满足当前的需要，而且还可以大量地储存起来。如果我们达到了这个目标，那末明年只要收成好，国家就有可能减少在集体农庄中收购谷物的数量。这一来，集体农庄就会有更有利的条件来发展畜牧业。
