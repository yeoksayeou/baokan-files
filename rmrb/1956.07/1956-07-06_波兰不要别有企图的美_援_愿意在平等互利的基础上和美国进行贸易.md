Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, July 5th: The Polish Press Agency reported that the Polish Red Cross, through the League of Red Cross Societies in Geneva on July 4th, rejected the assistance offered by the American Red Cross at the suggestion of the U.S. State Department, which came with many conditions.

On June 30th, the U.S. State Department suggested that the American Red Cross express to Poland the United States' willingness to supply Poland with a certain amount of grain, flour, and other food. When doing so, the State Department specifically stated that these grains should be used to "relieve the hunger situation of the Polish people." Any assistance accepted by Poland must be specially marked to indicate that it came from the United States. Poland believes that there is no need to accept such assistance.

As early as February of this year, when the cold wave hit Europe, the U.S. government had already made a similar proposal. The Polish government replied on February 28th that it was prepared to purchase a considerable amount of grain in the United States. However, the U.S. government has not responded for half a year. The Polish government has not withdrawn its proposal and still maintains it.

Poland believes that it is very clear from this what the true intentions of the U.S. ruling clique are when they propose various so-called generous "aid" suggestions to Poland. Especially at the same time as proposing the "aid" suggestion on June 30th, the U.S. official issued and took some statements and actions that were obviously unfriendly to People's Poland. The U.S. government did not consider giving Poland genuine assistance. On the contrary, its proposal to give "aid" was purely propagandistic and closely linked to the unfriendly actions of the U.S. ruling clique towards People's Poland.

Poland believes that it does not need charity from others; however, it is willing to develop broad commercial exchanges with the United States on an equal and mutually beneficial basis, and to purchase grain that Poland needs in the United States. The discriminatory trade policies adopted by the United States have hindered such exchanges. To strengthen the relationship between the Polish people and the American people, it is not necessary to give Poland charity, but for the U.S. government to understand that it must stop interfering in Poland's internal affairs and stop taking all unfriendly actions.

### 波兰不要别有企图的美“援”  愿意在平等互利的基础上和美国进行贸易

    波兰不要别有企图的美“援”
    愿意在平等互利的基础上和美国进行贸易
    新华社华沙5日电　据波兰通讯社报道：波兰红十字会在七月四日通过日内瓦的红十字会协会，拒绝美国红十字会在美国国务院建议下提出的带有许多条件的援助。
    六月三十日，美国国务院建议美国红十字会代向波兰表示美国愿意供给波兰一定数量的谷物、面粉和其他粮食。国务院在这样做的时候特意表明，这些粮食应该用来“解救波兰人民的饥饿情况”。波兰接受的任何援助在分配时必须加以特别的标记，以表明它是从美国来的。波兰认为没有任何必要接受这种援助。
    早在今年二月，当寒潮侵袭欧洲的时候，美国政府已经提出过一次类似的建议。波兰政府在二月二十八日答复说，它准备在美国购买相当数量的谷物。可是美国政府半年来没有答复，波兰政府并未收回它的建议，并且仍然保留着这个建议。
    波兰认为，由此可以十分清楚地看到，当美国统治集团在向波兰提出各种各样的所谓慷慨的“援助”建议的时候，他们的真正意图是什么。尤其是在六月三十日提出“援助”建议的同时，美国官方发表了和采取了一些显然是对人民波兰不友好的声明和行动。美国政府并没有考虑给波兰以真正的援助，相反地，它所提出的关于给予“援助”的建议纯粹是宣传性的，并且是同美国统治集团对于人民波兰的不友好的行动紧密相联的。
    波兰方面认为并不需要人家施舍；但是它愿意在平等互利的基础上发展同美国的广泛的商业交流，在美国购买波兰所需要的谷物。美国所采取的歧视性贸易政策阻碍了这样一种交流。要加强波兰人民同美国人民之间的关系，并不需要给波兰施舍，而是要美国政府了解必须停止干涉波兰的内政和停止采取一切不友好的行动。
