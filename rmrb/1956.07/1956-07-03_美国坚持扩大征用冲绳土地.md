Xinhua News Agency, July 2nd dispatch from Washington: The US State Department decided on June 29th not to formally respond to a memorandum recently submitted to the US government by Japanese Foreign Minister Mamoru Shigemitsu through the US Ambassador to Japan, Allison. In the memorandum, Shigemitsu described the recent escalating protests by residents of Okinawa against the US military's seizure of land.

Reuters reported that the State Department's decision indicates that the United States intends to maintain control over this air force base in the Pacific and to seize more land there for use by the US military. Washington believes that a statement made by US Ambassador to Japan Allison in Tokyo on June 27th has already clarified the US attitude. Allison said at the time that the United States would continue to "exercise its current rights and authorities" in Okinawa and would continue to do so "for a considerable time to come."

Reuters reported that US government officials believe that Okinawa is an "indispensable link" in the US's "defense" chain in the Far East, and "regardless of Japanese public opinion, the United States cannot change its policy toward Okinawa."

    美国坚持扩大征用冲绳土地
    新华社2日电　华盛顿消息：美国国务院在六月二十九日决定，对日本外务相重光葵最近通过美国驻日本大使艾利逊向美国政府提出的一项备忘录不作正式答复，重光葵在备忘录里叙述了冲绳岛居民近来日益高涨的抗议美国驻军征用土地的运动。
    路透社消息说，国务院的这一决定表明，美国要保持对太平洋上的这个空军基地的控制，并且要在那里征用更多土地供美国军队使用。华盛顿方面认为，美国驻日大使艾利逊六月二十七日在东京发表的一篇声明，已经说明了美国的态度。艾利逊当时说，美国要继续在冲绳岛“行使目前的权利和权限”，而且在今后“要继续一个相当长的时间”。
    路透社消息说，美国政府官员认为，冲绳岛是美国在远东的“防御”锁链中“不可缺少的环节”，“不管日本的舆论如何，美国不可能改变它对冲绳的政策。”
