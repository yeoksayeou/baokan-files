Who Will Solve This Problem?

　　The Qinghai Provincial Bureau of Handicrafts requested approval from the central government in March of this year to transfer a group of handicraft workers from Shanghai to support construction in Qinghai. The Shanghai Bureau of Handicrafts and the Qinghai Provincial Bureau of Handicrafts reached an agreement: Shanghai would guarantee the transfer of one hundred people to Qinghai, and Qinghai would be responsible for building factory buildings and providing machinery and equipment. In mid-May, we Shanghai handicraft workers received a letter from the Qinghai Provincial Bureau of Handicrafts stating that the factory buildings had been resolved, and we were to depart for Xining by the end of May. More than ninety of us arrived in Xining City on June 20th, but unexpectedly, we were all housed in the Xining Dazhong Hotel. At first, we thought it was just a temporary stay, but later we learned that even the foundation of the factory building had not yet been laid.

　　The responsible comrades of the factory went to the provincial bureau leaders to contact them, hoping to find a way to speed up the construction of the factory so that we could put into production as soon as possible. However, no one was willing to take responsibility. We also heard such a saying: others generally live in tents, you are given hotel accommodation, only eat and do not work, still paid wages, what are you complaining about? But we workers love labor and are unwilling to be idle. We have many production tasks in Shanghai. Because so many people were drawn out at once, the production task of dusters supporting agricultural production this year cannot be completed. However, we have no work to do when we arrive in Xining, which is intolerable.

　　We have calculated a detailed account: our monthly wages are nearly 8,000 yuan, plus room fees and other expenses, the provincial bureau has to pay more than 11,000 yuan per month. Judging from the current situation, we have to wait at least four months, making us eat the country's food for nothing, unable to create wealth for the country. What a great loss this is! Who will solve this problem?

    谁来解决这个问题？
    青海省手工业管理局在今年三月呈请中央批准，到上海市调一批手工业工人去支援青海建设。上海手工业管理局和青海省手工业管理局取得协议：上海保证调一百人到青海，青海负责建设厂房和机器设备。五月中旬，我们这些上海手工业工人接到青海省手工业管理局的来信，讲厂房已解决，要我们在五月底动身到西宁。我们九十多个人在六月二十日到达了西宁市，出人意料，却是让我们全都住在西宁大众旅社。起初，我们只当是临时住住，但后来才知道，厂房连基础还没有打好哩。
    厂的负责同志曾去找省局负责人联系，希望能设法加快建厂速度，好使我们早日投入生产。但是，竟无人肯负责。我们还听到这样一种说法：别人一般都是住篷帐，给你们住旅社，只吃不工作，照发工资，还吵什么呢？但我们工人是热爱劳动的，不愿意游手好闲。我们在上海的生产任务很多，由于一下子抽出很多人，今年支援农业生产的喷粉机的生产任务就不能完成，而我们到了西宁却没有工作可做，这能让人容忍吗？
    我们算了一笔细账：我们每月的工资将近八千元，加上房金等费用，省局每月要支付一万一千多元。从目前的情况来看，至少还要等四个月，使我们白吃国家的饭，不能给国家创造财富，这是个多么大的损失啊！谁来解决这个问题呢？
