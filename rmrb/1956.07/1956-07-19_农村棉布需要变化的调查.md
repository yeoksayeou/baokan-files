Investigation of Changes in Rural Cotton Cloth Needs
    Hao Xiangrong
    Recently, the Textile Company of Jieyu County, Shanxi Province, together with the county supply and marketing cooperative, carried a large number of cotton cloth samples to the countryside for exhibition and investigated the changes in farmers' needs for cotton cloth after agricultural cooperation.
    Jieyu County is a cotton-producing county in southern Shanxi. In the past, the rural areas had a foundation of hand-spinning and weaving, and most of the cloth worn was produced by themselves. Last year, advanced agricultural cooperatives were established, and land dividends were abolished. Farmers were very enthusiastic about participating in field labor. In particular, women felt that spinning and weaving were not cost-effective. For example, Li Duanduan, a female member of Xisu Agricultural Cooperative, said: "The year before last, because I was spinning and weaving at home, I only worked ninety labor days. Last year, I did not spin or weave, and my income was 132 yuan more than the year before, which could buy more than four bolts of cotton cloth." Therefore, hand-spinning and weaving have now disappeared.
    From the investigation of several typical households in Xisu Agricultural Cooperative, the amount of cloth used by farmers is increasing year by year, and the increase is relatively large:
Household		Population	Total Income Over the Years	Cloth Purchase	Cloth Purchase Amount
Rich Middle Peasant Sun Shenghai	8	1954: 1140 yuan		84 chi			29 yuan
				1955: 1420 yuan		231 chi			81 yuan
				1956:			319 chi (planned)	112 yuan (planned)
Middle Peasant Zhang Xiaoqian	12	1954: 975 yuan		87 chi			31 yuan
				1955: 1087 yuan		190 chi			66 yuan
				1956:			360 chi (planned)	168 yuan (planned)
Poor Peasant Liang Qiansheng	6	1954: 980 yuan		240 chi			84 yuan
				1955: 950 yuan		280 chi			91 yuan
				1956:			320 chi (planned)	126 yuan (planned)
    The above three households purchased an average of more than fifteen chi of cloth per person in 1954; in 1955, the average was twenty-seven chi per person; and this year, the planned amount of cloth per person is more than thirty-eight chi. The total amount spent on buying cloth by these three households in 1954 and 1955 was 382 yuan, accounting for 5.8% of the total income of 6,552 yuan. Among them, the amount spent by poor peasants on purchasing cotton cloth was the largest, accounting for slightly more than 9% of the total income.
    According to the survey materials, the requirements of farmers for the quality and variety of cotton cloth have also changed greatly. For example, Sun Shenghai, a well-to-do middle peasant, purchased all city cloth in 1954, but in 1955, out of 231 chi of cloth purchased, there were 96 chi of fancy serge, khaki, and twill cloth. This year, he plans to buy 319 chi of cloth, and only plans to buy 60 chi of plain weave cloth. Zhang Xiaoqian, a middle peasant, plans to buy 360 chi of cloth this year, and only plans to buy 47 chi of plain weave cloth. Liang Qiansheng, a poor peasant, bought 240 chi of cloth in 1954, of which fancy serge and twill only accounted for 43 chi. In 1955, he used 280 chi of cloth, of which 180 chi were fancy serge and twill cloth.
    Rural women have raised many opinions on the specifications and colors of cotton cloth. They generally reported that fancy serge and fancy twill cloth are narrower, which is inconvenient for tailoring, and require the width to be widened to two chi and four cun. Some people reported that the quality of the "Four Gentlemen" blue serge is not good, and it changes color after wearing it for a few days. The "Zhichan" brand and "Gongnong" brand fancy serge are not only ugly in shape, but also have uncoordinated colors. They hope that the production department can improve them.

    农村棉布需要变化的调查
    郝向荣
    最近，山西解虞县纺织品公司会同县供销社携带了大批棉布样品下乡展览，并调查了农业合作化以后农民对棉布需要的变化。
    解虞县是山西南部的一个产棉县，农村过去有土纺土织的基础，穿布多靠自己生产；去年实现了高级农业合作化，取消了土地分红，农民参加田间劳动的劲头很大，特别是妇女感到纺花织布很不合算，例如习苏农业社的女社员李端端说：“我前年因为在家纺花织布，只作了九十个劳动日，去年没有纺花织布，就比前年多收入132元，可以购买四匹多棉布。”因此目前土纺土织已经绝迹。
    从习苏农业社几户典型户的调查看，农民的用布量是逐年上升，而且上升幅度较大：农　　户　  人口　历年收入总值　购布量　      购布金额富裕中农　   8　  1954年1140元　84尺　　　      29元 孙升海　       　1955年1420元　231尺　 　      81元
                  1956年      　319尺（计划数） 112元（计划数）中农张孝谦　12　  1954年 975元　87尺　          31元
                  1955年1087元　190尺　         66元
                  1956年        360尺（计划数） 168元（计划数）贫农梁千盛　6　   1954年 980元　240尺　         84元
                  1955年 950元　280尺　　　     91元
                  1956年　      320尺（计划数） 126元（计划数）
    以上三户1954年每人平均买布十五尺多；1955年每人平均为二十七尺；今年每人计划用布量则为三十八尺多。这三户在1954和1955两年买布金额共382元，为总收入6，552元的5.8％。其中以贫农支出购买棉布的金额为最大，占总收入的9％强。
    从调查材料看，农民对棉布的质量、花色品种的要求变化也很大。例如富裕中农孙升海在1954年购买的全部是市布，而1955年买布231尺中，就有花哔叽、卡其和斜纹布九十六尺，今年计划买布319尺，只准备买平纹布60尺；中农张孝谦今年计划买布360尺中只准备买平纹布47尺；贫农梁千盛1954年买布240尺，花哔叽、斜纹布只占43尺，1955年用布280尺，其中180尺为花哔叽和斜纹布。
    农村妇女对棉布的规格、花色提出不少意见。她们普遍反映花哔叽、花斜纹布面窄些，裁衣不便，要求将幅面放宽到二尺四寸；有人反映四君子青哔叽质量不好，穿上几天就变色；支前牌、工农牌花哔叽不但花形不好看，而且配色不协调，希望生产部门能够改进。
