	Official Documents Are Always "Sleeping"
	People say that many official documents "go to sleep" when they arrive at the Second Office of the Tianjin Municipal People's Committee. This statement is quite true.
	On January 20th of this year, the Tianjin Municipal Labor Bureau wrote a report to the Second Office regarding the work tasks of the Labor Section in the future, requesting instructions from the Municipal People's Committee. However, there has been no response. The Labor Bureau has urged action by telephone and special letter more than ten times, but still, there is no news. Finally, left with no other choice, they sent a cadre in person on May 25th to urge them to act, only to find that the report itself had disappeared. Although it was eventually found, the labor work in various districts has been greatly affected.
	For example, on August 25, 1955, the Labor Bureau wrote two regulations concerning safety in production and submitted them to the Municipal People's Committee for instructions. However, nine months have passed, and they have not yet been approved.
	Why are these requests and reports "sleeping"? People cannot help but suspect that the Second Office of the Tianjin Municipal People's Committee is perhaps not entirely "awake" in handling official documents from below.

    公文老在“睡觉”
    人们说：不少公文到了天津市人民委员会第二办公室就“睡觉”了。这话很有些当真。
    今年一月二十日，天津市劳动局给第二办公室写了一个关于今后劳动科工作任务的报告，请求市人民委员会批示，但一直不见下文，劳动局虽然先后用电话用专函催办不下十数次，仍然渺无音讯。最后，无可奈何于五月二十五日派出干部亲自去催办，谁知连报告本身都无影无踪了，后来，虽然终算找到了，但各区劳动工作已受了很大影响。
    再如劳动局于1955年8月25日就有关安全生产问题，写了两个规定，向市人民委员会请示，但历时九个月了，到现在还没有批下来。
    这些请示报告为什么会“睡觉”呢？人们就不能不怀疑，天津市人民委员会第二办公室在处理下面来的公文中，是否也有点不大“清醒”。
