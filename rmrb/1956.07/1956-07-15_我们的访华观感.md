Our Impressions of a Visit to China
Dr. Bo Pa’er, Head of the Afghan Cultural Delegation

At the invitation of the Chinese Ministry of Culture, the Afghan Cultural Delegation left Kabul on June 10th, passing through New Delhi, Calcutta, and Hong Kong, and arrived in Guangzhou on June 14th. During our stay in China, we visited Guangzhou, Beijing, and some major cities in Northeast and Southeast China. During the visit, we learned about the education, culture, industry, agriculture, and handicrafts of New China, which are very useful to us.

Since liberation, education in China has developed rapidly. The number of students has increased in all levels of schools, such as universities, colleges, normal schools, middle schools, and primary schools. People throughout the country have access to education. The government has a unified education plan to guide schools at all levels. The teaching staff in schools are generally of a high level, and well-equipped laboratories and libraries provide students with good learning conditions. Many newly built schools have tall classrooms and dormitory buildings, spacious sports grounds, and health stations. Studying in such schools is indeed a very happy thing. Students do not have to pay tuition fees. The government attaches great importance to the new talents cultivated in schools and guarantees their employment after graduation.

With the development of the national economy, a large number of engineers and technicians are needed to develop various natural resources and minerals to establish various industries. Therefore, specialized technical schools and colleges are established everywhere to train new talents in large numbers. In the open-pit coal mines and oil refineries in the Northeast, we personally spoke with some technicians who graduated from the above-mentioned schools.

The government also attaches great importance to educating the general workers to improve their cultural and technical levels. Spare-time cultural schools and various short-term training courses are set up everywhere. A literacy campaign has been carried out throughout the country. We heard that in some rural areas, the method of children teaching their mothers is adopted. This shows that the country is adopting all means to eliminate illiteracy.

The economy of New China has developed rapidly. The government is working hard to make the country completely independent economically. We have seen various kinds of light and heavy industrial products produced by China itself, from textiles to heavy machinery. It is difficult to see imported goods in the market. The value of the Renminbi is very stable, which fully demonstrates the stability of the national economy.

We have also seen the development of heavy industry. Chinese engineers and workers are not satisfied with their own achievements, but are still working hard to modernize and automate their factories, thereby increasing production. Last year's coal and iron production increased greatly compared with the previous year. China can now manufacture heavy-duty lathes by itself, and their quality and performance are no worse than those of other countries. At the same time, many machines are also exported to other countries. We have also seen some industrial raw materials imported from other countries, which shows that trade between China and other countries is constantly developing.

The cotton textiles produced in China made a deep impression on us. These products are excellent in terms of pattern, color, and quality. The silk, wool textile, and rubber industries are also developing rapidly. In Hangzhou, we visited silk reeling factories and tea production cooperatives, which were very interesting.

In terms of transportation, New China has built many new railways, and busy railway and waterway transportation can be seen everywhere. In Tianjin, we had the opportunity to visit the Tanggu New Port. We were told that the Tanggu New Port will play a major role in the import of raw materials and the export of manufactured goods in Northeast China. We also saw many foreign ships berthed there with our own eyes. In Shanghai, we also saw the busy Huangpu River.

With the development of the agricultural cooperative movement, the output of agricultural products has greatly increased. Workers and farmers are working hard in their respective posts, helping each other, improving production and expanding the cultivated area. The lives of farmers are guaranteed. They look very healthy and are well taken care of by the government. We learned that the yield per unit area of rice, wheat, corn, vegetables, etc. has been greatly increased.

The country has carried out many water conservancy projects to utilize water power and prevent disasters.

The workers in New China live very happily, with high wages, labor insurance benefits, and improved living conditions. Welfare facilities such as nurseries, kindergartens, health stations, and clubs have also been built for them.

Every factory is striving to improve the living standards and technology of workers, which is very important for the development of China's industry.

We visited many scenic spots. Especially Hangzhou, which is indeed the most beautiful place in China. On the plane from Guangzhou to Beijing, we saw a green field full of crops everywhere.

Our stay in China was very short and interesting. We made full use of every minute to understand its people, culture, and historical background. We are very happy that our neighbor, China, can make rapid progress. The people of Afghanistan and China each have a long history, and we hope that mutual cultural exchanges can be developed between the two peoples, thereby promoting friendship.

Soon, we will return to our motherland. However, we will bring back beautiful memories of China and an understanding of the Chinese people. We will never forget the warm hospitality of our Chinese friends. I and the members of the Afghan Cultural Delegation would like to express our gratitude to our hosts, who provided us with various assistance and conveniences throughout China.

Long live the friendship between China and Afghanistan!

    我们的访华观感
    阿富汗文化代表团团长　波帕尔博士
    阿富汗文化代表团应中国文化部的邀请，于六月十日离开喀布尔，途经新德里、加尔各答、香港，六月十四日抵达广州。在中国逗留期间，我们访问了广州、北京和中国东北、东南部的一些大城市。在参观中，我们了解到新中国的教育、文化、工业、农业和手工业等方面的情况，这些情况对我们说来是很有用处的。
    解放以后，中国的教育发展得很迅速。在所有各级学校中，如大学、学院、师范学校、中学、小学等，学生的人数都有增加。全国人民都有受教育的机会。政府有一个统一的教育计划来指导各级学校。学校中师资的水平一般较高，设备完善的实验室和图书馆为学生们提供了良好的学习条件。有许多新建立的学校，拥有高大的教室和宿舍大楼、宽敞的运动场和卫生站。在这样的学校中学习的确是一件很快乐的事。学生们不必缴学费。政府很重视学校中培养出来的新人材，并保证他们毕业后的工作。
    随着国家经济的发展，需要大批的工程师和技术人员来发掘各种自然资源矿藏，以建立各项工业。因此，在各地都设有专门技术学校和学院来大批训练新人材。在东北的露天煤矿和炼油厂中，我们都亲自和一些从上述学校中毕业出来的技术人员交谈过。
    政府也很重视对一般工人群众进行教育，来提高他们的文化和技术水平。到处都设有业余文化学校和各种短期训练班。全国都进行了扫盲运动。我们听说，在有的农村里，采用了孩子教妈妈的办法。这说明了国家采用一切办法来扫除文盲。
    新中国的经济发展得很快。政府正努力使得国家在经济上能完全独立。我们看到了各种各样的中国自己出产的轻重工业产品，从纺织品一直到重型机器。在市场上我们很难看到进口货。人民币的价值十分稳定，这也完全说明了国家经济的稳定。
    我们也看到了重工业的发展。中国的工程师和工人们并不满足于他们自己的成绩，还是在努力使他们的工厂更现代化和自动化，从而提高产量。去年的煤和铁的产量比前年大为增加，中国自己已能制造重型车床，而其质量和性能都不差于其他国家的产品。同时，有许多机器还出口到其他国家去。我们也看到一些从其他国家输入的工业原料，这说明了中国和其他国家之间的贸易正在不断地发展。
    中国出产的棉织品使我们得到很深刻的印象。这些产品，无论在花样、颜色或质量方面都是十分优良的。丝织、毛纺、橡胶等工业也都在迅速发展。在杭州，我们参观了缫丝厂和茶叶生产合作社，十分有趣。
    在交通运输方面，新中国建筑了许多新铁路，到处都看到繁忙的铁路和水路运输。在天津，我们有机会参观了塘沽新港。别人告诉我们，塘沽新港对中国东北地区的输入原料和制成品输出将起重大的作用。我们也亲眼看见了许多外国轮船停泊在那里。在上海，我们也看到了运输繁忙的黄浦江。
    随着农业合作化运动的发展，农产品的产量大为提高。工人和农民们都在他们各自的岗位上努力工作，相互帮助，提高生产并扩大耕种面积。农民们的生活得到了保证。他们看起来都很健康，得到政府很好的照顾。我们了解到，大米、小麦、玉米、蔬菜等的单位面积产量都有很大的提高。
    国家进行了许多水利计划，来利用水力，防止灾害。
    新中国的工人们生活得十分愉快，工资很高，还享受劳动保险待遇，居住条件也有改进。还为他们修建了托儿所、幼儿园、卫生站、俱乐部等福利设施。
    每一个工厂都努力于提高工人们的生活水平和技术，这对发展中国的工业说来是十分重要的。
    我们参观了许多风景优美的地方。特别是杭州，那确实是中国最美的地方。我们在从广州到北京的飞机上，看到一片绿色的田野，到处长满着庄稼。
    我们在中国的逗留是很短暂并且有趣的。我们充分利用了每一分钟时间来了解它的人民、文化和历史背景。我们很高兴我们的邻居——中国能有飞跃的进步。阿富汗和中国的人民都各自有着悠久的历史，希望两国人民之间能发展相互的文化交流，从而促进友谊。
    不久以后，我们就要回到自己的祖国去了。可是，我们将带着对中国的美丽记忆和对中国人民的了解回去。我们将永不忘记中国朋友们的殷勤款待。我和阿富汗文化代表团的团员们愿意对我们的主人们表示谢意，他们在中国各地都给予我们各种帮助和便利。
    中国和阿富汗之间的友谊万岁！
