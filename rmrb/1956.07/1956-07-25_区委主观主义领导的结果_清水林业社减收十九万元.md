Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, 23rd: Qingshui Township in Xing'an County, Guangxi Province, is a place with many mountains, little farmland, and dense forests, but a strange phenomenon has appeared in this township: the forestry cooperative is not engaged in forestry production.

After this township achieved advanced cooperativization this year, the CCP District Committee did not lead the development of production based on the production habits of the farmers. It insisted on farmers changing their management habits, demanding that the Qingshui Forestry Cooperative strive for grain self-sufficiency this year, with an average grain yield of 950 jin per mu of paddy field. Otherwise, the government would no longer supply grain when there was a shortage. The secretary of the CCP Qingshui Township branch dared not accept this requirement and was severely criticized by the District Committee. In order to ensure the completion of agricultural production tasks, the Qingshui Cooperative sent the vast majority of leading cadres to lead agricultural production. The production plan formulated mentioned only agricultural production, without a single word about forestry production. The agricultural production quotas were also set too high, stipulating that if the quota was not completed, 40 work points would be deducted for every dan of reduced production. As a result, the entire cooperative, from top to bottom, had only agricultural production in mind.

The forestry resources in this township are very rich. Farmers can earn 80,000 yuan annually from forestry operations, which is almost twice the total agricultural income of the township. If sideline occupations combined with forestry, such as charcoal burning, papermaking, dried bamboo shoot production, and medicinal herb gathering, are developed, income can be increased by more than 110,000 yuan. Therefore, farmers here have historically invested their main labor force in forestry and sideline production, with only 30% of the labor force invested in agriculture.

This subjective demand to change farmers' management habits has brought great losses to forestry and sideline production. Now, the township's forestry and sideline production is unattended, and agricultural production has not turned out as desired. Although cooperative members have worked diligently day and night for more than half a year, with an attendance rate of over 90%, even if all the paddy fields produce 950 jin of grain per mu as required by the District Committee, it is still far short compared to the income from forestry and sideline production. Cooperative members criticized the District Committee as using: "subjectivist methods and measures that do not compensate for the losses."

    区委主观主义领导的结果 
    清水林业社减收十九万元
    据新华社南宁23日电　广西省兴安县清水乡是个山多田少，丛林茂密的地方，但是这个乡出现了一种奇怪现象，林业社不搞林业生产。
    今年这个乡实现高级合作化后，中共区委会对它没有根据农民的生产习惯来领导发展生产，硬要农民改变经营习惯，要求这个乡的清水林业社争取今年粮食自给，每亩水田平均产粮九百五十斤，否则缺粮时政府不再供应。中共清水乡支部书记不敢接受这个要求，受到了区委会的严厉批评。清水社为了保证农业生产完成任务，绝大多数领导干部都去领导农业生产，制定的生产规划，也只有农业生产，对林业生产只字未提。农业的包产定额也定得过高，规定如果完不成定额，每减产一担，就要扣工分四十分。这样一来，全社人员从上到下，心目中就只有一个农业生产了。
    这个乡的林业资源非常丰富，每年农民经营林业可以收入八万元，差不多等于全乡农业收入的两倍。如果再把和林业相结合的副业如烧木炭、造纸、制干笋、找药材等开展起来，又可增加十一万余元的收入，所以这里的农民历年都把主要劳动力投入林业和副业生产，只把30％的劳动力投入农业。
    这种主观要求改变农民经营习惯，已给林业和副业生产带来很大损失。现在，全乡的林业和副业生产无人管理，而农业生产也没有如人愿。尽管半年多来社员日日辛勤劳动，出勤率达90％以上，即是所有水田都按区委要求每亩产粮九百五十斤，如果同林业和副业生产收入比较，还是差得很远。社员们批评区委是：主观主义的办法，得不偿失的措施。
