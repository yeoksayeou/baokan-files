    Is This Also "Improving" Product Quality?
    The Wuxi City Product Quality Comparison Exhibition has not been over for long, and just as the superior quality movement is gradually unfolding, the Wuxi City Joint State-Private Lixin Textile Printing and Dyeing Factory and the Joint State-Private Weixin Dyeing Factory are actually using methods of "changing appearances and substituting inferior goods for good" to deceive the people.
    In May of this year, the Wuqiao Cooperative Store in Wuxi City, Jiangsu Province, purchased a batch of Millennium Mercerized Yuan cloth produced by the Lixin Textile Printing and Dyeing Factory from the Wuxi City Textile Company Wholesale Department. When measuring the cloth, it was clearly seen that the label stated "Third Class," but inside there was the wording "Outside Class." Outside Class goods are of lower quality and price than Third Class goods. This was clearly the Lixin Textile Printing and Dyeing Factory substituting inferior goods for good. After several negotiations, they agreed to take it back for exchange. Who knew that after they took the cloth back, they did not actually exchange it, but used chemicals to erase the words "Outside Class," still stamped it with "Third Class," and sent it back to the Wuqiao Cooperative Store. After the Wuqiao Store received the cloth, they discovered that the mark from the first measurement was still there, and exposed this fraud. The Lixin Textile Printing and Dyeing Factory initially refused to admit the error, but was rendered speechless when the evidence was presented.
    The Joint State-Private Weixin Dyeing Factory originally planned to process a batch of People's Hero Brand Second Class Vulcanized Mercerized Grey Khaki for the Textile Company Wholesale Department. Because the stock of this cloth was insufficient, they were unable to deliver the goods; since the Wholesale Department was pressing them hard, they hastily tore off the labels of the old Third Class goods stored in the factory, turned the cloth over, and attached a Second Class label, before sending it to the Wholesale Department. When the Wholesale Department inspected the goods, the words "Old Third Class" that had not been completely removed were still clearly visible on the cloth.
    People cannot help but ask: while other factories are carrying out the superior quality movement, are the Lixin Textile Printing and Dyeing Factory and the Weixin Dyeing Factory "improving" product quality in this way? The Wuxi City Textile Industry Bureau should quickly inspect the work of these two factories and stop this shameful behavior. Zhang Gengsheng

### 这也是“提高”产品质量吗

    这也是“提高”产品质量吗
    无锡市产品质量对比展览会结束还没有多久，正当优质量运动逐步开展的时候，无锡市公私合营丽新纺织印染厂和公私合营维新漂染厂竟在那里用“改头换面，以次充好”的办法欺骗人民。
    今年五月份，江苏省无锡市吴乔合作商店从无锡市纺织品公司批发部买回一批丽新纺织印染厂出产的千年丝光元布。过尺的时候，明明看见牌子上写的是三等品，里面却有一个“等外品”字样。等外品比三等品质量次、价格低。这明明是丽新纺织印染厂在那里以次充好。经过几次交涉，他们答应可以退回去换。谁知他们拿回这批布，并没有真的调换，而是用药水把“等外品”三个字擦掉，仍然盖上“三等品”，又送回吴乔合作商店。吴乔商店拿到布以后，发现第一次过尺的记号还在，又揭发了这个骗局。丽新纺织印染厂开始还不承认错误，直到把证据拿出来才哑口无言。
    公私合营维新漂染厂原计划给纺织品公司批发部加工一批人民英雄标二等硫化丝光灰卡其、因为这种布的存数不足，没办法交货；批发部催得又紧，他们就急急忙忙把厂里存有的老三等品的牌子撕掉，把布翻了一个面，贴上一张标二等的牌子，就送到批发部。批发部验收的时候，没撕干净的“老三等”字样还清清楚楚的留在布上。
    人们不禁要问：别的工厂正在开展优质量运动的时候，难道丽新纺织印染厂和维新漂染厂就这样“提高”产品质量吗？无锡市纺织工业局应该迅速检查这两个厂的工作，制止这种可耻的行为。张庚生
