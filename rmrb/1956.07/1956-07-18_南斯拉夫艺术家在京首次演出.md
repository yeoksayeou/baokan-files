The solo performance by Vilma Bukovitz, the most outstanding soprano from the People's Republic of Slovenia, was the first program of the evening. This female singer, who has visited many countries in Europe and Africa, sang selections from the famous opera "Madame Butterfly" and two Yugoslav songs.

The Croatian humorous dance and the wedding scene from the ballet "Legend of Ohrid" performed by Nevenka Bižin and Ivica Sertić were full of national flavor and vivid humor.

The male octet, renowned in Europe, sang seven songs of different styles tonight. They sang "Partisan Song," which praises the guerrillas who fought for the freedom of Yugoslavia, "Komitadji Song," which calls on the people to resist Turkish rule, and songs such as "Kolo" and "The Frog's Wedding," which are full of life and humor. After a long applause from the audience, the octet added the Chinese song "Qinghai Folk Song," which won two rounds of enthusiastic cheers from the entire audience with its beautiful singing full of deep emotion.
