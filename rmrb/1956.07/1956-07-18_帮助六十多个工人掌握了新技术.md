Xinhua News Agency, Lüda, July 16th: Technician Ba Diancheng, who helped more than sixty workers master new technologies and learn advanced experience, was recently named an advanced producer.

　　Ba Diancheng is a technician at the Dalian Shipbuilding Company's Shipbuilding Machinery Plant, who has been out of school for less than a year. When he served as an instructor in the company's high-speed cutting technology theory study class in early March this year, he often took the initiative to go deep into the workshop to specifically help workers learn and apply various advanced experiences. Zou Fangzhou, a worker who learned high-speed cutting with his help, used to be able to make only five to six large screws for ships per shift (eight hours), but now he has increased his speed to making one in twenty minutes.

　　Ba Diancheng also adopted the method of signing mutual learning contracts with workers to help them master advanced experience. Not long ago, he signed a contract with worker Lü Xiangchen, systematically helping Lü Xiangchen master five kinds of advanced experience, which significantly improved Lü Xiangchen's technical level. In the recent evaluation, Lü Xiangchen has been promoted from a fourth-grade worker to a fifth-grade worker.

　　Ba Diancheng also used his spare time to help more than thirty lathe operators learn the advanced experience of high-speed thread picking, which increased the work efficiency of these workers by an average of more than six times.

　　The workers who learned advanced experience and improved their skills with Ba Diancheng's help have now become the backbone of the factory. Recently, twenty-four of these workers were named advanced producers, and fourteen groups became advanced production units.

    帮助六十多个工人掌握了新技术
    新华社旅大16日电　技术员巴殿成帮助六十多名工人掌握了新技术和学习了先进经验，在最近被评为先进生产者。
    巴殿成是大连造船公司造船机械厂的一个刚出学校不到一年的技术员。他在今年三月初，担任公司举办的高速切削技术理论学习班教员的时候，经常主动深入车间，具体帮助工人学习和运用各种先进经验。在他的帮助下学会了高速切削的工人邹方洲，做轮船上的大螺丝原来每班（八小时）只能做五个到六个，现在已经提高到二十分钟做一个。
    巴殿成还采用和工人签订互学合同的方法，帮助工人掌握先进经验。在不久前，他和工人吕相臣签订了合同，有计划地帮助吕相臣掌握了五种先进经验，使吕相臣的技术水平得到显著的提高。在最近评级时，吕相臣已由四级工晋级到五级工。
    巴殿成还利用休息时间，帮助三十多名车工学会了高速挑扣的先进经验，使这些工人的工作效率平均提高六倍多。
    在巴殿成帮助下学会了先进经验和提高了技术的工人，现在都已成了工厂的骨干力量。最近，这批工人中有二十四名工人被评为先进生产者，十四个小组成为先进生产单位。
