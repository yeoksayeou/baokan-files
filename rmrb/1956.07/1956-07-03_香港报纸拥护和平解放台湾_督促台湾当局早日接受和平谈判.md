Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 2nd - Premier Zhou Enlai's speech at the Third Session of the First National People's Congress on June 28th has generated a wide range of reactions in Hong Kong. On June 30th, many Hong Kong newspapers prominently featured the section of the speech regarding the liberation of Taiwan on their front pages. Many newspapers also published commentaries.

    The "Cheng Pao," a Hong Kong private newspaper with a large circulation, published an editorial stating: "We believe that as a Chinese citizen, if one has any spirit, no one would want to see their country divided into two." The commentary suggested that if the Chinese Communist Party and the Kuomintang could cooperate again, "to resist foreign aggression with one heart," then "every Chinese would earnestly expect and promote its realization." The newspaper also believed that a renewed cooperation between the Chinese Communist Party and the Kuomintang was not entirely impossible. The newspaper criticized the Chiang Kai-shek group's "Foreign Minister" Yeh Kung-chao for prematurely "closing the door to peace talks" and requested Premier Zhou Enlai to propose specific steps and conditions for the peaceful liberation of Taiwan. Yeh Kung-chao had stated in Phnom Penh that the Chiang Kai-shek group would "not, absolutely not" resolve the Taiwan issue peacefully through negotiation. The newspaper's editorial argued that if a principle unanimously supported by people at home and abroad could be put forward, then the Chiang Kai-shek group would "not be able to close the door to negotiations again." The editorial stated: "China has been dominated by others for a hundred years. The day for Chinese people to stand tall in the world should be coming. Any Chinese with spirit, who would not want their country to be independent, unified, and strong!"

    A commentary in the "Hong Kong Commercial Daily," another newspaper representing Hong Kong's business community, stated that Premier Zhou Enlai's announcement indicated that the Chinese Communist Party "is indeed willing to resolve the Taiwan issue peacefully." The commentary stated: "The general trend is irresistible. What else can the Kuomintang in Taiwan rely on? Then, why not step down early and start negotiations with Beijing?" The commentary also rebuked the Chiang Kai-shek group, saying: "Although there are differences between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, they are all Chinese. Behind closed doors, they are one family. What cannot be discussed? If someone, for the sake of the interests of a small group, still holds the despicable idea of 'rather perish at the hands of foreigners than be conquered by domestic slaves,' then they will become a sinner of China, cursed by people for all ages!"

    The "Sing Tao Daily" editorial stated that currently, the Kuomintang government cannot talk peace, but also does not talk war, "Isn't being neither at peace nor at war a long-term confinement to Taiwan? Therefore, people with insight believe that the National Government should have new expressions to break the stalemate."

    The "New Life Evening News" commented that after the Chiang Kai-shek group fled to Taiwan, "factional struggles not only did not decrease, but became more complicated." The newspaper's commentary worried that the Chiang Kai-shek group's "future will be full of thorns."

    Another newspaper touting a "third force," the "Chung Sheng Evening News," published a commentary stating, "It is likely that if Taiwan is willing to negotiate with the Chinese Communists, the United States cannot interfere." The newspaper revealed that Taiwan "may have dissatisfaction" with the United States in political, economic, and military matters.

    The "Hong Kong Times," which is pro-Chiang Kai-shek group, maliciously slandered the suggestions in Premier Zhou's report, saying that the suggestion was a "rumor offensive" and "united front magic." Some other pro-American and pro-Chiang Hong Kong newspapers, in their commentaries, even self-deceptively promoted that Premier Zhou's speech was an indication of the "weakness of the Chinese Communists."

    香港报纸拥护和平解放台湾
    督促台湾当局早日接受和平谈判
    新华社广州2日电　周恩来总理六月二十八日在第一届全国人民代表大会第三次会议上的发言在香港引起了广泛的反应。六月三十日的香港很多报纸都以头条地位刊载了这一发言中有关解放台湾的部分。许多报纸还发表了评论。
    销路很大的香港民营报纸“成报”发表社论说：“我们以为，作为一个中国的老百姓，如果是有血性的，任谁都不愿看到自己的国家分裂为二。”这篇评论认为，中国共产党和国民党如果能够再度合作，“同心御侮”，“则每一个中国人，都会殷切的期望而且促其实现”。这家报纸还认为，中国共产党和国民党的重新合作，不是绝无可能的。这家报纸批评了蒋介石集团的“外交部长”叶公超过早“关闭和谈之门”，并且要求周恩来总理提出和平解放台湾的具体步骤和条件。叶公超在金边曾经说蒋介石集团“不，绝不”通过协商和平解决台湾问题。这家报纸的社论认为，假如有一个为海内外人士一致拥护的原则提出来，则不容蒋介石集团“再关闭谈判之门”。社论说：“百年来中国已给别人支配够了，中国人在世界上挺起胸膛的日子该要来临了，凡是有血性的中国人，谁不愿自己的国家独立、统一、强大起来！”
    另一家代表香港商界的报纸“香港商报”的评论认为，周恩来总理的宣布，表示中国共产党“的确愿意用和平的方式去解决台湾问题。”评论说：“大势所趋，难予抗拒，台湾国民党还有什么可以依恃？那末，为什么不可以趁早下台，与北京开始谈判？”评论还斥责蒋介石集团说：“国共之间虽有歧见，但都是中国人，关起门来是一家，什么事情不可以商量？如果有人为了小集团的私利，仍抱着‘宁亡于外人，不亡于家奴’的卑鄙之念，则将成为中国之罪人，千秋万代，永为人所唾骂！”
    “星岛日报”的社论说，在目前，国民党政府不能言和，但亦不言战，“不和不战岂不长期困守台湾？因此，有识之士，认为国民政府应有新的表示，以打破闷局”。
    “新生晚报”在评论中说，蒋介石集团逃到台湾后，“派系斗争不但没有减少，而且更趋复杂化”。这家报纸的评论担心蒋介石集团“前途荆棘殊多”。
    另一家标榜“第三势力”的“中声晚报”发表评论说，“殆如台湾愿意与中共和谈，美国确无法干涉。”这家报纸透露，台湾对美国不论在政治上、经济上和军事上都“可能有不满之处”。
    亲蒋介石集团的“香港时报”恶意地诬蔑周总理报告中的建议，说这个建议是“谣言攻势”和“统战魔术”。另外一些亲美蒋的香港报纸在评论中更自欺欺人地宣传，周总理的发言是“中共荏弱”的表示。
