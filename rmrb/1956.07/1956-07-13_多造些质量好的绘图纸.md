    Produce More High-Quality Drawing Paper
    As architecture students, we cannot live without drawing paper. However, we are constantly worrying about drawing paper. Every time we go to department stores to buy drawing paper, the answer we often get is "out of stock." Once, we went to a cooperative to take a look and happened to find some for sale. Upon inquiring about the price, it was 5 jiao per sheet. We were overjoyed at the time. Who knew that after buying it and using it, erasing it a few times would cause it to fluff up, and erasing it a few more times would peel off a layer. This really put us in a difficult situation. We hope that relevant departments can produce more high-quality and affordable drawing paper for us, so that we can buy it no matter where we are. (Zhai Wanying)

    多造些质量好的绘图纸
    我是学建筑的，绘图纸对我们来说是每天都不可缺少的。可是，我们每天都为绘图纸操心。每当我们去百货公司买绘图纸的时候，得到的回答常是“没有”。有一次，我们到合作社去看看，恰巧有卖的，一打听价钱，五角一张。当时把我们欢喜透了。谁知买回来一用，橡皮擦几下就起毛，再擦几下就起一层皮，真把我们难坏了。我们希望有关部门多给我们造一些质量好、价格便宜的制图纸，使我们不管在那个地方都能买得到。（翟万英）
