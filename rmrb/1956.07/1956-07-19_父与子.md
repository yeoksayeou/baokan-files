　　In the early morning of a day in 1955, a group of people gathered in front of the Yangquan Municipal Party Committee office building, again singing the excerpts of ballad that Old Man Zhang had said before his death. One said, "Remember? He said to the Secretary of the Municipal Party Committee: 'If you officials don't work for the people, you won't see how miserable the people who are suffering are.'" Another imitated the old man's tone, saying, "My son runs the 'Construction News,' and I play the lotus ballad at home."

　　Who exactly was this Old Man Zhang? Not only did those who spoke and listened to the ballad know, but even the children on the street could recognize him when he was begging for food along the street. At that time, he wore tattered clothes, held a casserole in both hands, and grabbed the maggot-ridden vegetable rice from the casserole to eat as he walked. When he felt hot and his mind was dull, he would crawl into the garbage dump and grab watermelon rinds to eat. The watermelon rinds were covered with flies and wriggling maggots, but he would shoo away the flies and gobble them down. After his stomach was upset, he would have diarrhea everywhere. Once, he squatted on the street, surrounded by a large crowd of people. Someone asked who it was, and the children angrily said, "He's the father of the Deputy Secretary-General of the Municipal Party Committee."

　　When Old Man Zhang first came to Yangquan City in October 1952, Zhang Fengru, the Deputy Secretary-General of the Municipal Party Committee, was still the Deputy Editor-in-Chief of the Yangquan City "Construction News." The staff of the "Construction News" still remember that when Zhang Fengru's father first arrived, he was wearing a cotton-padded jacket and black cloth pants. Although the cotton-padded jacket had patches, his clothes were clean. He was a straightforward old peasant who couldn't keep anything to himself. Whenever he came to sit in the small newspaper's editorial department, if someone struck up a conversation with him, he would sometimes praise his son in front of everyone, and sometimes scold his son. Before long, the people in the editorial department learned from the old man that Zhang Fengru had once returned home during the busy autumn harvest, and the grain was still in the field. Zhang Fengru advocated letting others carry it, but his father was afraid that others would not be careful, and insisted on carrying it himself. Because of this, the father and son quarreled. As they quarreled, Zhang Fengru was about to hit his father, scaring his father into running everywhere, and he chased after him. His father ran to the outhouse, and he followed him to the outhouse. His father was so frightened that he jumped into the cesspool and broke his leg; it was later treated in the province. When Old Man Zhang told the people in the editorial department about this, he sighed and said, "Alas, what an unfilial son!" Zhang Fengru also heard these words, and his nose turned red with anger.

　　From then on, Zhang Fengru believed that his father was unreasonable because his father was supported by him, but always revealed his shortcomings. In Zhang Fengru's eyes, the old man became a thorn in his side.

　　After Zhang Fengru's wife, Li Lianhua, was transferred to work in Yangquan, the old man's life became even more difficult. In February and March of 1953, everyone was warming themselves by the fire, but they didn't provide a fire in the father's room. The father was so cold that he had to secretly sleep next to the boiler in the hot water room. Old Man Zhang originally loved cleanliness, but at this time he became associated with dirty things. His food and clothing were not the same as before. Sometimes the old man had nothing to eat, and his son didn't care. One day, Zhang Fengru and his wife were drinking and eating dumplings when, unexpectedly, his father came again. Zhang Fengru looked like he had seen an enemy, and shouted, "Get out! Get out!" "You're drinking and eating dumplings, can't I even smell them?" His father said this and left sadly. Li Lianhua pointed at Zhang Fengru's nose and said, "Why didn't you beat him to death! If you had killed him earlier, you would have saved so much trouble." One day, the messenger Ma Junqing saw that Zhang Fengru's father had nothing to eat and no one to take care of him, so he brought a bowl of rice and two steamed buns and told the old man to eat. As soon as it was placed in front of the old man, the bowl of rice was kicked over by Zhang Fengru.

　　What was strange was that although Zhang Fengru's abuse of his father had aroused public anger among many comrades, the Party branch to which he belonged never came forward to intervene. In the winter of 1953, he became the Deputy Secretary-General of the Yangquan Municipal Party Committee. At this time, Zhang Fengru's abuse of his father had moved from indoors to outdoors. His father's spirit was suppressed, and he became mentally deranged. He wore tattered clothes, carried two iron teapots, and wandered around, saying, "My son runs the 'Construction News,' and I play the lotus ballad at home." Who knew that Zhang Fengru saw him once, not only threw the pair of iron teapots into the distance, but also pinned his own father down in the ditch and beat him severely. The lonely old man stood by the ditch, trembling with anger. He didn't say a word, and tears streamed down his face.

　　The old man, with tears in his eyes, knew that he had no hope and could only beg for food along the streets of Yangquan City. He was getting thinner and thinner every day, and was on the verge of death. Sure enough, one day in October 1954, the police station called the Municipal Party Committee and said, "Deputy Secretary-General Zhang's father has fallen ill on the overpass on the street." By the time they used a handcart to pull him back, the old man's face had turned as pale as a dead man. Zhang Fengru hurriedly went to buy a coffin. Just as he was preparing to put him in it, Wang Dingmo, the Minister of Industry of the Municipal Party Committee, stopped him and said, "Old Zhang, your father's heart is still warm, how can you put him in a coffin? You want him to die, but you can't do it like this!" This forced Zhang Fengru to ask for a doctor. However, the doctor was already powerless at this point. He wanted to give him a shot of stimulant, but the old man, who was so thin that he was only skin and bones, could not be injected with a needle, and he died miserably like this.

　　The old man has been dead for more than a year, but people still can't forget this incident. At the Municipal Party Congress held in early 1955, someone raised a request that the Municipal Party Committee seriously deal with the matter. What was the result? Zhang Fengru, who had abused his father in every possible way, is now safely serving as the Deputy Secretary of the Third Mine Party Committee of the Yangquan Mining Bureau. People can't help but ask: What reason is there to ignore this accusation?

    父与子

    1955年的一天清晨，一群人聚集在阳泉市委办公大楼前面，又在演唱张老汉生前说的那几段快板。这个说：“记得吧，他当着市委书记说：‘你当官不为民作主，看不见眼前的受气人多凄苦。’”那个学着老汉的声调说：“我儿办的是建设报，我在家打的是莲花落。”
    这张老汉到底是个什么人呢？这，不仅说快板和听快板的人们知道，当他沿街寻食的时候，连街上的孩子们也能认出来。那时候，他身披着破衣烂衫，双手捧着个沙锅，边走边用手去抓沙锅里的生了蛆的菜饭吃。热得心里发烧，脑子发闷，他就钻到垃圾堆里，抓西瓜皮吃。西瓜皮上，爬满了苍蝇，还有蠕动着的小蛆，他赶赶蝇子，狼吞虎咽地吃了下去。肚子吃坏了，又到处拉稀屎。一次，他蹲在大街上，四周拥挤着一大群人，有人问这是谁？孩子们都愤愤地说：“是市委副秘书长他爹。”
    1952年10月，张老汉刚来阳泉市的时候，市委副秘书长张枫如还是阳泉市建设报的副总编辑。在“建设报”的工作人员，至今还没有忘记，张枫如他爹刚来时，身上披了一件棉袄，下身穿一条黑布单裤，虽然棉袄有补钉，衣服却洗的干干净净。他是个生性耿直的老农民，心里憋不住半句话，逢到来小报编辑部坐坐，如果有人和他攀谈，他总是当着大伙儿有时夸讲自己的儿子，有时又骂自己的儿子。编辑部的人们，不久就从老汉嘴里知道了，张枫如有次回家，秋收正忙，谷子在地里没有担回来。张枫如主张让别人去担，他爹怕别人不仔细，主张自己担。为这事，父子俩吵起来了。吵着吵着，张枫如就要打他爹，把他爹吓的到处奔跑，他就追打，他爹跑到毛厕，他就跟到毛厕。他爹吓昏了，往粪坑里一跳，把腿折断了；后来到省里才治好的。张老汉向编辑部的人们说起这件事的时候，叹说：“唉，真是个不孝之子！”这些话，张枫如也在场听到了，气的他鼻子尖直冒汗珠。
    张枫如从此认为他爹不近人情，因为他爹受了他供养，却老是揭他的短处。老人在张枫如的眼里，成了一颗钉子了。
    当张枫如的妻子李莲花调来阳泉工作以后，老人的日子更不好过了。1953年二、三月间，大家都在烤火，他俩不给父亲的房里生火，父亲冻得没法，只好偷偷地睡在开水房的锅炉旁边。张老汉原本也爱干净，可这时的确变得和脏东西结了缘。吃穿都不像以前了。有时老汗没吃的，儿子也不管。一天，张枫如家俩口正在喝酒吃饺子，没想到爹又来了。张枫如像见了仇敌，嘴里嚷道：“出去！出去！”“你们喝酒吃饺子，我闻闻也不行？”他爹说罢这句话，伤心地走了。李莲花指着张枫如的鼻子尖说：“你打他，为什么不往死里打！早打死了，省了这许多麻烦。”一天，通讯员马俊卿看见张枫如他爹没吃的，又没人管，就端了一碗饭，两个馒头，叫老汉吃。刚放在老人家跟前，饭碗就被张枫如一脚踢翻了。
    叫人奇怪的是：张枫如虐待他爹的行为，虽然已经引起不少同志的公愤，他所属的党支部却始终没有出面干涉。1953年冬季，他当了中共阳泉市委的副秘书长。这时，张枫如对他爹的虐待已经从屋里搬到屋外。他爹精神受到压抑，人变得神经失常了。他穿着破衣烂衫，担着两个铁茶壶，到处游走，嘴里说着：“我儿办的建设报，我在家打的是莲花落。”谁知道有一次被张枫如看见了，那一对铁壶给扔到远处不说，还被自己的儿子压在水沟里，被狠狠地打了一顿。那个孤苦的老人，站在水沟旁，浑身气的发抖，他一言不发，两眼老泪横流。
    老汉噙着眼泪，知道自己没指望了，只能到阳泉市沿街乞讨。眼看他一天天消瘦了，奄奄待毙了。果然，在1954年十月里的一天，派出所打电话通知市委说：“张副秘书长的父亲病倒在大街的天桥上了。”等用排子车去拉回来，老汉脸色已经变得跟死人一样。张枫如匆匆赶去买了一口棺材。正准备装哩，市委工业部长王定谟阻止他说：“老张，你爹心口还是热的，怎么能装棺材呢？你盼他死，也不能这样啊！”这才使张枫如不得不去请医生。可是，医生到这时候已经无能为力了，想打强心针，瘦得只剩了一张皮的老汉，身上已经扎不进针去，就这样惨死了。
    老人死了一年多了，可是人们一直不能忘记这件事。在1955年初召开的市党代表会议上，有人曾经提出要求市委严肃处理。结果怎样呢？对自己的父亲百般虐待的张枫如，现在倒安然地在阳泉矿务局担任着三矿分党委副书记。人们不禁要问：有什么理由不理会这个控诉？
