    Fruit Harvest Expected at Guanting Lake
    (Our Dispatch) More than 30,000 mu of fruit trees near the Guanting Reservoir in Huailai County, Hebei Province, are bearing abundant fruit, and fresh fruit has begun to hit the market.
    More than 110 fruit-producing villages near the Guanting Reservoir have achieved advanced cooperativization. The fruit farmers' enthusiasm for production has generally increased. They have fully utilized the more than 1,700 sprayers of various types they have purchased over the past few years, and all the fruit trees have been sprayed with pesticides three to four times. The fruit farmers have changed the habit of not scraping old tree bark in the spring, and 27,000 mu of orchards in the county have had their old tree bark scraped. The area for pest and disease control has also expanded five to six times compared to previous years, and pests such as the pear slug caterpillar and tent caterpillar, which have been the most harmful over the years, have been completely eliminated. In addition, there have been significant improvements in pruning, fertilization, soil and water conservation, and irrigation compared to last year. The fruits are full and plump, and it is estimated that 13 to 14 million jin of fruit can be produced. The "Huailai Apples" and "Shaying Grapes," famous in Beijing and Tianjin, and the "Bai Wu Bian Almonds," sold throughout the country, are all expected to have a bumper harvest. (Wang Shuchang)

    官厅湖畔水果丰收在望
    本报讯　河北省怀来县官厅水库湖畔的三万多亩果树，果实丰硕，鲜果开始上市。
    官厅水库附近的一百一十多个盛产水果的村庄，实现了高级合作化，果农们生产积极性普遍提高，他们把几年来买下的一千七百多架各种喷雾器完全使用起来，所有的果树都喷撒了三至四次农药。果农们改变了春季不刮老树皮的习惯，全县有两万七千亩果园刮了老树皮。病虫防治面积也比往年扩大了五至六倍，历年为害最甚的梨星毛虫、天幕毛虫等害虫已全部消灭。此外，在剪枝、施肥、水土保持、灌溉等方面，也比去年大有改进，果实丰满，估计可生产水果一千三、四百万斤。驰名京津的“怀来苹果”、“沙营葡萄”和行销全国的“白五扁杏仁”都可望丰收。（王树常）
