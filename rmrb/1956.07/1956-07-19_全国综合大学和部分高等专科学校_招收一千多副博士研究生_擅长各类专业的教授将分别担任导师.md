Xinhua News Agency, 18th: National comprehensive universities and some higher polytechnic, agricultural, forestry, and medical schools have decided that registration for associate doctoral students this year will take place from July 25th to September 15th, and entrance exams will be held from October 10th to 20th.

The State Council recently approved the "Provisional Measures for the Enrollment of Associate Doctoral Students in Higher Education Institutions in 1956" from the Ministry of Higher Education.

The measures stipulate that citizens of the People's Republic of China under the age of forty who have graduated from a higher education institution with a bachelor's degree and have more than two years of scientific and technological work, educational work, or other practical work experience related to science; those who have graduated from a higher education institution with a bachelor's degree, have not participated in practical work, or have less than two years of work experience, but have excellent academic performance, as certified by their original school or work unit; and those who have not graduated from a higher education institution with a bachelor's degree, have more than three years of work experience, and are certified by a scientific institution, higher education institution, or their work unit to possess the equivalent of a higher education bachelor's degree and the ability to engage in scientific research work, may apply for the exam according to prescribed procedures. The qualifications for applying for clinical medical specialties are: all graduates of higher education institutions with a bachelor's degree must have more than three years of work experience; those equivalent to graduates of higher education institutions with a bachelor's degree must have more than five years of work experience.

The application process will be handled by the higher education institutions responsible for training associate doctoral students. Higher education institutions enrolling associate doctoral students may entrust other regional higher education institutions to administer the exam based on the geographical distribution of applicants.

Higher normal schools will not enroll associate doctoral students this year.

Xinhua News Agency, 18th: Higher education institutions nationwide will enroll 1,015 associate doctoral students for the first time this year. Registration for enrollment will be handled by the higher education institutions responsible for training, starting from July 25th.

Twenty-three higher industrial schools will enroll 152 associate doctoral students. 146 professors specializing in geology, prospecting, power, metallurgy, machinery, transportation, and other fields will serve as supervisors for these students.

Among the professors serving as supervisors at Tsinghua University, Jiaotong University, Dalian Institute of Technology, Tongji University, and East China Institute of Water Conservancy, eleven are members of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. Liu Xianzhou, an expert in the history of Chinese mechanical engineering; Liang Sicheng, an expert in Chinese architecture; Meng Zhaoying, an expert in electronic tubes; Zhou Zhihong, an expert in metallographic heat treatment; Qian Lingxi, an expert in port engineering structures; and Li Guohao, an expert in roads, bridges, and tunnels, will all serve as supervisors for associate doctoral students this year.

The science departments of thirteen comprehensive universities nationwide will enroll 293 associate doctoral students. Weak links in our country's scientific research, such as inorganic chemistry, the ionosphere, semiconductor physics, crystal physics, chemical kinetics, metal physics, and topography, will be addressed starting this year, with relevant professors from Peking University, Fudan University, Wuhan University, Nanjing University, Northeast People's University, and other schools responsible for training associate doctoral students. For example, Yang Shixian, Vice President of Nankai University and an expert in organic chemistry, plans to work with professors from relevant teaching and research groups to train seven associate doctoral students in organic chemistry.

Comprehensive universities plan to enroll 173 associate doctoral students this year in disciplines such as the fundamentals of Marxism-Leninism, philosophy, history, Chinese language and literature, foreign languages and literature, economics, and ethnology at the Central University for Nationalities. Among them, Renmin University of China will train fifteen associate doctoral students in the fundamentals of Marxism-Leninism, philosophy, and other disciplines.

Peking University will enroll a total of 157 associate doctoral students. It is the higher education institution enrolling the most graduate students of all types nationwide this year.

Agricultural and forestry scientists such as rice expert Ding Ying, plant pathology expert Yu Daqun, agricultural entomology expert Zou Zhonglin, fruit tree cultivation expert Wu Gengmin, and soil scientist Hou Guangjiong will all serve as supervisors for training associate doctoral students this time. This year, thirteen higher agricultural and forestry schools plan to train 150 associate doctoral students in various disciplines.

Nineteen higher medical schools will train 247 associate doctoral students in twenty-three specialties including basic medicine, clinical medicine, hygiene, and pharmacy.
