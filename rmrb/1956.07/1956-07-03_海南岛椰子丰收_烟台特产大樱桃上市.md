(Dispatch from Guangzhou) Hainan Island's coconuts are being marketed steadily. It is estimated that more than 22 million coconuts can be harvested by the end of October. In Lingshui County, the existing 90,000 coconut trees are bearing an average of 27 to 30 coconuts each. This is a rare good harvest in recent years. The 30,000 coconut trees planted by the Second Agricultural Production Cooperative in Yancun Township, Qiongdong County, are expected to yield coconuts worth 28,000 yuan, with an average income of 140 yuan per member household.

During the coconut harvesting season, farmers in various regions are also actively preparing for seed preservation and breeding. It is planned to expand planting by 300,000 mu and 5.4 million coconut trees next year, turning Hainan into a beautiful coconut island.

(Dispatch from Yantai) In recent days, Yantai City, Shandong Province, has seen a large number of its specialty big cherries hit the market. These big cherries are a specialty of the suburbs of Yantai City and the areas of Fushan, Muping and other counties. They are five or six times larger than ordinary cherries, with small pits, plump flesh, and delicious flavor. They are further divided into two categories: big red cherries and crystal cherries; the white crystal cherries have an even sweeter flavor, and the canned cherries made from them sell well at home and abroad. Since June 13th, the Yantai City Supply and Marketing Cooperative has been able to purchase 30,000 to 40,000 jin of white cherries in the market every day. In addition to selecting a portion for processing by canning factories and selling them in the city, a large number of fresh cherries have been transported to Beijing, Tianjin, Jinan, Lushun-Dalian, Shenyang and other cities.
