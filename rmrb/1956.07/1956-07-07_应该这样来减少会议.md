Meetings Should Be Reduced in This Way
    Zheng Qimin, Xu Yao

    A worker at the Shanghai Hengfeng Joint State-Private Cotton Mill said to the factory's leading cadres: "Please hold fewer meetings and give us more time to rest!" Is this just the cry of one worker? No, this is the common demand of the broad masses of workers and grassroots staff. Too many meetings are an old problem in factories and mines, and this old problem has not been thoroughly resolved in the current high tide of industrial production.

    Excessive meetings not only seriously affect workers' cultural and technical studies, physical health, and family life, but also tie up the hands and feet of enterprise staff, preventing them from frequently approaching the masses, delving into reality, and promptly understanding situations and handling problems.

    Currently, some party organizations and leading cadres in factories and mines have begun to pay attention to reducing meetings. This is a good phenomenon. Many enterprises have stipulated systems for streamlining meetings and have uniformly arranged workers' spare time activities. Doing so is certainly necessary, but it is far from sufficient to limit it to these. This is because the problem of excessive meetings is not only caused by unsound meeting systems and poor meeting methods. Excessive meetings are also due to enterprise leaders' undetailed work styles and weak mass perspectives. Therefore, if enterprise party organizations and leaders simply stipulate some systems to cut meetings without paying attention to improving their leadership styles and strengthening their mass perspectives, then meetings cannot be truly reduced, or "open meetings" will be reduced, but "black meetings" will still be numerous. As a result, not only will the stipulated systems not be adhered to, but workers and grassroots staff will lose confidence in streamlining meetings, thinking that the problem of too many meetings is unsolvable. This phenomenon has already occurred in the Changchun No. 1 Automobile Manufacturing Plant. In March of this year, the factory's Party Committee, according to instructions from the higher Party Committee, rearranged workers' spare time activities and streamlined many meetings. However, because they did not pay enough attention to improving their leadership styles and work methods, although everyone could not hold meetings during workers' spare time, they used cadres' and workers' lunch breaks and time before work in the morning to hold meetings. This, on the contrary, increased the burden on workers and grassroots staff. Some people call this practice: "Changing the appearance, but not the substance."

    Currently, there are indeed quite a few enterprise leading cadres who are accustomed to calling grassroots staff to meetings, regardless of whether they are understanding situations, assigning tasks, inspecting work, or summarizing work. The Harbin Linen Textile Factory was like this before it changed its leadership style. At the beginning of this year, the factory was preparing to promote advanced experiences. However, the factory director and Party Committee secretary did not go down to the grassroots on weekdays, so they did not know which advanced experiences in the factory needed to be promoted. At that time, they were unwilling to go down to clarify this issue, so they notified the heads of each branch factory to come to the factory headquarters for a meeting to report on this situation. The heads of each branch factory also did not understand the situation, so the meeting obviously did not have good results. Therefore, the heads of the branch factories went back to convene meetings of workshop directors and work section leaders to understand the situation, summarize experiences, and then go to the factory headquarters for meetings to report. In this way, they held meetings layer by layer, busy for several days. Holding meetings is one of the important leadership methods, but if meetings are held for everything, regardless of the size of the matter, leading cadres will inevitably be tied up in the conference room, without time to go down and specifically lead production. This will inevitably lead the enterprise's leading cadres into such a predicament: the less they delve into reality and understand the situation, the more they have to hold meetings when they encounter problems; the more meetings they hold, the less they can delve into reality to understand the situation.

    To change this situation, the key lies in whether leading cadres have the determination to change this situation of so-called principal leadership that floats on the surface and is generalized, and truly delve into hard work. The experience of many enterprises proves that as long as the leadership work of enterprise leaders is detailed and penetrates more deeply, meetings in the enterprise can be greatly reduced, and problems in the work can be resolved in a timely manner. With the help of the higher Party Committee, the Harbin Linen Textile Factory's Party Committee began in February of this year to resolutely change its past leadership style. On the one hand, it stipulated systems to reduce meetings, and on the other hand, it determined that each Party Committee member, branch factory general branch secretary, and administrative, trade union, and Communist Youth League leading cadres would spend half of their time each day going into workshops and work sections to help grassroots staff solve problems. After leading cadres went down to the grassroots, meetings were reduced, and major problems in production could be discovered and resolved in a timely manner. For example, when factory director Xu Hua went to the weaving workshop to inspect work in late February, he promptly helped workshop cadres solve the problem of frequent machine failures. Now, the Linen Factory not only has fewer meetings, but also holds them better than in the past, because they pay attention to conducting in-depth investigations and research before meetings. For example, before the Party Committee discussed how to further carry out the advanced producer movement, the Party Committee organized deputy secretaries, engineers, and trade union chairmen and other responsible cadres to go deep into the workshops to find out the problems existing in the current movement and put forward specific methods and requirements. As a result, the Party Committee expanded meeting only lasted more than an hour and the problem was solved. Lower-level cadres were very satisfied with this meeting.

    To streamline meetings, enterprise leaders must also strengthen the mass perspective and overcome the conservative thinking of not trusting the masses and underestimating the masses' awareness. The so-called trust in the masses means, on the one hand, believing that the Party members, Communist Youth League members, and activists in the enterprise have the ability to conduct individual persuasion and education work on the workers, and that through the individual persuasion and education work of these people, the Party and the state's various policies and higher-level instructions can be promptly conveyed to the broad masses of workers; on the other hand, it also means believing that the workers can accept the education of Party members and activists. However, to this day, there are still many enterprise leading cadres who do not trust the masses and do not use the strength of Party members and activists. When selling this year's public bonds, the leaders of the local state-owned Yubei Cotton Mill neither saw that the workers' class consciousness had been greatly improved and that they would actively purchase public bonds, nor did they believe that Party members and activists could do a good job of individual persuasion and education work, and they still occupied the entire factory's workers' spare time for three full days to hold large and small meetings for mobilization. What was the actual situation? After the factory broadcast the news of purchasing public bonds to the workers, many workers actively subscribed for public bonds. Before the large meeting was held, two workshops had already overfulfilled the plan for selling public bonds. Similarly, when selling public bonds, many factories such as Changzhou Dacheng No. 3 Factory and Minfeng Cotton Mill did not hold various meetings or make large reports for mobilization. They simply made full use of the strength of Party members, Communist Youth League members, and propagandists to carry out publicity and education work among the masses, and as a result, they quickly completed the plan for selling public bonds. Since some factories in Shanghai began to reduce meetings at the end of last year, many Party organizations have paid attention to mobilizing all Party members to conduct individual persuasion and education work among the masses. As a result, not only have fewer meetings been held, but mass work has also been done more deeply and extensively than in the past. These experiences and lessons all show that as long as leaders trust the masses and dare to rely on the masses to carry out work, they can liberate themselves and the masses from many unnecessary meetings.

    应该这样来减少会议
    郑启民　徐耀
    公私合营上海恒丰纱厂有一个工人对厂里的领导干部说：“请你少开点会，多给我们些休息时间！”这只是一个工人的呼声吗？不，这是目前广大职工群众和基层工作人员的共同要求。会议多，是厂矿企业中的一个老问题，而这个老问题在目前工业生产高潮中并没有得到彻底的解决。
    过多的会议不仅严重地影响了职工们的文化技术学习、身体健康和家庭生活，也束缚住了企业工作人员的手足，使他们不能经常地接近群众，深入实际，及时地了解情况和处理问题。
    目前，有些厂矿企业的党组织和领导干部已经开始注意减少会议。这是一个好现象。许多企业都规定了精简会议的制度，统一安排了职工的业余活动时间。这样做当然是必要的，但仅限于这些则是很不够的。因为会议过多的问题并不只是由于会议制度不健全和开会的方法不好所造成的。会议过多，还因为企业领导者的工作作风不深入和群众观点不强。因此，如果企业党组织和领导者只是简单地规定一些制度去削减会议，而不注意改进自己的领导作风和加强群众观点，那么，会议并不能真正减少，或者“明会”减少了，“黑会”仍是很多。结果不仅所规定的制度坚持不了，反而会使职工群众和基层工作人员对精简会议丧失信心，认为会多的问题是无法解决的。长春第一汽车制造厂就已经发生了这种现象。今年三月间，该厂党委会根据上级党委的指示，重新安排了职工的业余活动时间，精简了许多会议。但是，因为他们对改进领导作风和工作方法注意不够，在职工业余学习时间内大家虽然不能开会了，可是利用干部和工人中午的休息时间和早晨上班以前的时间来开会。这样，反而加重了职工和基层工作人员的负担。有人称这种做法是：“改头换面，实质不变。”
    现在，确有不少企业领导干部不管是了解情况，布置工作，检查工作，总结工作，都习惯于把基层工作人员找来开会。哈尔滨亚麻纺织厂在没有转变领导作风以前就是这样。今年年初，厂里准备要推广先进经验。但是，厂长和党委书记因为平日不下去，就不了解厂里有哪些先进经验需要推广，当时又不愿下去弄清这个问题，于是就通知各分场主任来厂部开会汇报这方面的情况。各分场主任同样不了解情况，会议当然没有好的结果。于是，分场主任回去召集车间主任和工段长开会，了解情况，总结经验，然后再到厂部去开会汇报。就这样一层层地开会开会，忙了好几天。开会，是领导的重要方式之一，但是，如果不论事情大小，都要开会，领导干部势必被束缚在会议室里，没有时间深入下去具体地领导生产，这就必然会使企业的领导干部陷于这样一种困境：越是不深入实际，不了解情况，越是遇事就得开会；越是开会多，就越不能深入实际了解情况。
    要改变这种情况，就在于领导干部有没有决心改变这种浮在上面进行一般化的所谓原则领导的状况，真正地深入下去进行艰苦的工作。不少企业的经验证明，只要企业领导者的领导工作深入了、具体了，那么企业里的会议不但可以大大地减少，而且工作中的问题也能得到及时的解决。哈尔滨亚麻纺织厂党委会在上级党委的帮助下，从今年二月开始下决心改变过去的领导作风，一方面规定制度减少会议，一方面确定每个党委委员、分场总支书记和行政、工会、青年团的领导干部每天用二分之一的时间深入车间和工段，帮助基层工作人员解决问题。领导干部深入下去以后，会议减少了，而且能够及时地发现和解决生产上的重大问题。比如，厂长徐华在二月下旬去织布场检查工作的时候，就及时帮助车间干部解决了机器时常发生故障的问题。现在，亚麻厂的会议不但少，而且开得比过去好，因为他们注意了在会议前进行深入的调查研究。如党委会在讨论怎样进一步开展先进生产者运动的问题以前，党委会就组织副书记、工程师和工会主席等负责干部深入车间摸清当前运动中存在的问题，提出了具体的办法和要求，结果党委扩大会议只开了一个多小时就解决了问题。下面干部对这次会议感到非常满意。
    要精简会议，企业领导者还必须加强群众观点，克服不相信群众、过低估计群众觉悟的保守思想。所谓相信群众，就是一方面要相信企业里的党员、团员和积极分子有对职工群众进行个别说服教育工作的能力，通过这些人的个别说服教育工作就可以把党和国家的各项政策，上级指示，及时传达给广大职工；另一方面还要相信职工群众能够接受党员和积极分子的教育。但是，至今仍然有不少企业领导干部不相信群众，不去发挥党员和积极分子的力量。在推销今年公债的时候，地方国营豫北纱厂的领导者就是既看不到职工的阶级觉悟已有很大的提高，会踊跃购买公债；也不相信党员和积极分子能做好个别说服教育工作，而仍然占用全厂职工整整三天的业余时间来召开大会和小会进行动员。实际情况怎样呢？当该厂把购买公债的消息向职工群众广播以后，许多工人纷纷认购公债，在没有召开大会以前就有两个车间超额完成了推销公债的计划。同样是推销公债，常州大成三厂和民丰纱厂等许多工厂并没有召开各种会议，也没有作大报告进行动员，他们只是充分地运用党员、团员和宣传员的力量，对群众进行宣传教育工作，结果都很快地完成了推销公债的计划。上海市有些工厂从去年年底开始减少会议后，不少党组织都注意发动全体党员对群众进行个别说服教育工作，结果不但会开得少了，群众工作也比过去做得更深入更广泛了。这些经验和教训都说明，只要领导者相信群众，敢于依靠群众进行工作，就能把自己和群众从很多不必要的会议中解放出来。
