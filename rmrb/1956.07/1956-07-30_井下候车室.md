    Underground Waiting Room
    (Our Dispatch) A worker's waiting room has been built underground at the Fuguo Mine No. 1 Pit of the Liaoyuan Mining Bureau. The waiting room is built where workers go to and from work, with white walls and seating. In the past, the road was muddy, and workers were prone to slipping when going to and from work. Now, workers can safely wait indoors when going to and from work. Therefore, the workers are very satisfied. (Wang Shijun)

    井下候车室
    本报讯　辽源矿务局富国矿一坑井下修建了工人候车室。候车室修建在工人上下班的地方，室内有洁白的墙壁，并且设有坐位。过去满路泥泞，工人们上下班的时候容易滑倒，现在工人上下班可以安然在室内等候，因此，工人们都很满意。　　　　（王士俊）
