Xinhua News Agency, 10th dispatch: A Kyodo News Agency reporter dispatched a news item from Washington pointing out that US authorities expressed disappointment over the fact that Japanese left-wing parties obtained more than one-third of the seats in the House of Councillors election.

The news stated that the US government believes that if the Hatoyama cabinet becomes unpopular, it will strengthen Japan's neutralist tendencies. The US government "expressed vigilance" towards the development of Japan-Soviet negotiations, Japan's trade with China, and the issue of Okinawa.

Kyodo News Agency reported on the eve of the vote that the US State Department and the Pentagon both attached considerable importance to the results of the Japanese election, and they were clearly pinning their hopes on a victory for the conservatives. The results of this election will affect Japan's constitutional revision and rearmament. US officials have consistently emphasized that these two matters are very important to Japan's "defense." Furthermore, they believe that a victory for the Japanese conservatives would help resolve the Okinawa issue in a way that is favorable to the United States. Otherwise, they worry that this issue will have an adverse impact on the disputes over US military bases in Japan itself.

The "New York Times" said in today's editorial that the victory of the Socialists and other leftists in the election is a setback for the "plan to fully defend Japan." It said, "It must be seen as an indication that there is some political instability in Japan, and that a trend not very friendly to the United States has emerged and persisted." The newspaper threatened that "this trend is an obstacle to Japan's progress."

America's "Daily Mirror" commented today that the election results reflect Japan's tendency towards neutrality. "Many Japanese are convinced that the only way to trade with the Asian continent is to turn to neutrality." The newspaper said that as long as Japan forms a close alliance with the United States, it is unlikely to restore its traditional trade with China.

    美国对日参议院选举结果失望
    新华社10日讯　共同社记者从华盛顿发出的一条消息中指出，美国当局对日本左翼党派在参议院选举中获得三分之一以上的议席这件事，表示失望。
    消息说，美国政府认为，鸠山内阁如果不得人心的话，将会加强日本的中立倾向。美国政府对日苏谈判、日本同中国的贸易和冲绳岛等问题的发展，“表示警惕”。
    共同社在投票前夕曾经报道说，美国国务院和五角大楼都相当重视日本这次选举的结果，他们显然是把希望寄托在保守党人的胜利上。这次选举结果将影响日本的宪法修改和重新武装。美国官员们一直强调，这两件事对日本的“防务”是很重要的。此外，他们认为，日本保守党人如果取得胜利就将有助于使冲绳问题得到对美国有利的解决。否则，他们担心这个问题将会对美国在日本本土的军事基地的纠纷产生不利的影响。
    “纽约时报”在今天的社论中说，社会党人和其他左派人士在选举中所取得的胜利是对于“使日本具有充分防御的计划的一个挫折”。它说，“必须把它看作是一个迹象，说明在日本存在着某种政治不稳定状态，说明对美国不大友好的趋势已经出现并且坚持下去”。报纸威胁说，“这种趋势对于日本的进步是一种阻碍”。
    美国的“每日镜报”今天评论说，这次选举结果反映了日本的中立趋向。“许多日本人深信：能够在亚洲大陆进行贸易的唯一出路就是转向中立”。报纸说，只要日本同美国结成紧密的同盟，它就很少有可能恢复它同中国进行的传统贸易。
