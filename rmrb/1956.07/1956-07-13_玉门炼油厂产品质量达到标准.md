Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, July 12th. All products manufactured by the Yumen Oilfield Refinery now meet the quality standards stipulated by the state. This is a significant achievement since the refinery launched a campaign to improve product quality this year.

In the past, the quality of products from the refinery was not high, and many products became substandard or waste products. The rejection rate for some products was as high as 25% or more. To change this situation, the factory launched a campaign to improve product quality in March this year, summarizing and promoting 21 advanced experiences. Party, administrative, trade union, and Communist Youth League organizations also actively encouraged employees to provide rationalization proposals related to improving product quality, and promptly rewarded those who made achievements in improving product quality. In addition, methods such as running training courses and advanced experience lectures, and signing master-apprentice contracts were adopted to organize employees to learn technology. Therefore, since April, some products that were of poor quality in the past have successively met quality standards.

    玉门炼油厂产品质量达到标准
    新华社兰州12日电　玉门油矿炼油厂出厂的各种产品，现在已经全部达到了国家规定的质量标准。这是炼油厂今年开展提高产品质量运动以来取得的巨大成绩。
    炼油厂过去产品质量不高，有许多产品变成了次品或废品。有些产品的废品率高达25％以上。为了改变这种情况，从今年三月份起，这个厂就展开了提高产品质量的运动，总结和推广了二十一种先进经验；党、行政、工会、青年团等组织，也积极鼓励职工提供有关提高产品质量的合理化建议，及时奖励对改善产品质量有成绩的人。此外，还采用办训练班和先进经验讲座、订师徒合同等办法，组织职工学习技术。因此，炼油厂从四月份以来，一些过去质量不高的产品，都陆续达到了质量标准。
