Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 28th. The first graduating class of 31 students from the technical class of Shanghai No. 1 Deaf-Mute School have begun to take up their work posts. They have been assigned to work in printing and dyeing factories, Shanghai Film Studio, and other places.

　　This group of graduates studied fine arts and carpentry for two to three years respectively at the school. They learned the basic theories of animation, pattern design, or woodworking, and their Chinese language proficiency reached the junior high school level. During their studies, two-thirds of their time was spent on practical operations and production internships in relevant enterprises.

　　This year, nine students from the fine arts pattern group who interned at the state-owned Shanghai Silk Company Printing and Dyeing Factory designed 41 kinds of beautiful export silk patterns in two months, and received bonuses from the factory. In the school's exhibition room, there are more than 40 kinds of exquisite children's toys on display. These are samples made by the carpentry graduates in May for the state-owned Shanghai Department Store's children's goods store.

　　Next semester, this school will become a specialized school dedicated to teaching fine arts, woodworking techniques, and training teachers for deaf-mute schools to deaf and mute youths. The school's name will also be changed to Shanghai Deaf-Mute Youth Technical School.

    聋哑学校技术班的毕业生
    新华社上海28日电　上海市第一聋哑学校技术班的第一届毕业生三十一人开始走上工作岗位。他们被分配到印染厂、上海电影制片厂等处工作。
    这一批毕业生在学校的美术科和木工科分别学习了两年到三年。他们学会了动画、图案或木工制作等简要的理论，语文程度也达到初中水平。他们在学习中，有三分之二的时间参加了实际操作和在有关企业部门进行生产实习。
    今年在国营上海丝绸公司印染厂实习的九个美术科图案组学生，在两个月中绘制了四十一种华美的出口花绸的花样稿，得到了工厂发给的奖金。在学校的陈列室里，陈列着四十多种精巧的儿童玩具。这是木工科毕业生在五月间为国营上海市百货公司儿童用品商店制作的样品。
    下学期，这个学校将成为专门对聋哑青年传授美术、木工技术和培养聋哑学校师资的专业学校。学校的名称也改为上海市聋哑青年技术学校。
