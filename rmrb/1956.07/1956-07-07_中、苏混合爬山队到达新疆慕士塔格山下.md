    Sino-Soviet Joint Climbing Team Arrives at the Foot of Muztagh Ata in Xinjiang
    The members of the Sino-Soviet Joint Climbing Team have all gathered at the foot of Muztagh Ata in western Xinjiang on the 5th and have begun reconnaissance activities to conquer this high mountain.
    Muztagh Ata, standing at 7,546 meters above sea level, looms before the Sino-Soviet Joint Climbing Team members. It stands proudly like a giant ice and snow tower amidst the icy peaks of the Pamir Plateau mountain range. There is no vegetation on the mountain; except for the cliffs and the foot of the mountain, it is entirely covered with ice and snow two to three people deep. A dozen silvery white glaciers flow straight down from the cliffs to the foot of the mountain on all sides.
    The local Tajik and Kyrgyz herders, as well as the Uyghur farmers, call this mountain the "Father of Ice Mountains." Although summer has arrived, heavy snow often falls on the mountain. The rapidly flowing meltwater from Muztagh Ata rushes down from the foot of the mountain for miles, joining other streams to irrigate millions of mu of land in the Kashgar and Yarkand oases, which are rainless year-round. Many Tajik and Kyrgyz young men and women in love pledge their vows to the "Father of Ice Mountains," swearing that their love will be as pure and eternal as Muztagh Ata.
    Muztagh Ata is more than 1,900 meters higher than Mount Elbrus, the highest peak in the European Caucasus. Such high peaks can only be found in a few places in Asia. The famous Swedish traveler Sven Hedin attempted to climb this peak four times in 1894, but he never reached above 6,800 meters. The renowned British mountaineer Eric Shipton and his friends came here to climb more than half a century later. According to his own report, although they reached about 7,000 meters, they had to descend in failure because the severe cold damaged their feet. Local Kyrgyz herdsmen told reporters that the summit of Muztagh Ata had never been marked by human footprints in the past, and perhaps the People's Government has a way to conquer it.
    For the Chinese and Soviet mountaineers, conquering this high ice mountain with thin oxygen, low air pressure, and extreme cold is indeed a serious struggle. Although most Soviet climbers have about ten to twenty years of climbing experience, this is the first time they have attempted to conquer such a high mountain. The young Chinese mountaineers have only climbed Mount Taibai, which is 4,113 meters high, in their own country. Only a few athletes climbed Peak October in the Soviet Union last year, which is 6,780 meters above sea level. However, the Chinese and Soviet mountaineers expressed their confidence that although there are various difficulties, they will definitely be able to conquer it.

    中、苏混合爬山队到达新疆慕士塔格山下
    中、苏混合爬山队的队员五日已经全部集结在新疆西部的慕士塔格山下，并且开始了征服这座高山的侦察活动。
    在中、苏混合爬山队队员面前的慕士塔格山，拔海7，546公尺。它像一座巨大的冰雪之塔，傲然耸立在帕米尔高原群山的冰峰之中。山上没有草木，除悬崖和山脚以外，全复盖着两三人深的冰雪。十来条银白色的冰河，从山崖中直泻到四面山脚下。
    当地塔吉克族和柯尔克孜族的牧人，以及维吾尔族的农民，都把这座山叫作“冰山之父”。夏天虽然到来，山上却经常大雪纷飞。慕士塔格山融雪急湍的流水，从山脚下一泻千里，会合其他水流，灌溉着终年不雨的喀什噶尔绿洲和叶尔羌绿洲几百万亩土地。许多塔吉克族和柯尔克孜族青年男女谈情说爱，都指着“冰山之父”为盟，发誓愿他们的爱情像慕士塔格山一样纯洁和永恒。
    慕士塔格山比欧洲最高的高加索山厄尔布鲁士峰还要高1，900多公尺。这样高的山峰，只有在亚洲才能找到几个。著名的瑞典旅行家斯文·赫定1894年曾经四次试图登上这个高峰，但他始终不能到达6，800公尺以上。英国有名的登山运动家埃·希普顿和他的朋友在半个世纪多以后来到这里登山，根据他自己的报告，他们虽然登到了7，000公尺左右，但由于严寒冻坏了脚而不得不失败下山。当地柯尔克孜族牧民对记者说，过去慕士塔格山顶上从来没有印上过人类的足迹，也许人民政府有办法把它征服。
    对于中、苏两国爬山运动员来说，征服这座氧气稀薄，气压低和极度寒冷的高大冰山，确是一场严重的斗争。苏联爬山家虽然大多有着十年到二十年左右的爬山历史，但还是第一次去征服这样的高山。年轻的中国爬山运动员在自己国内还只攀登过4，113公尺高的太白山。只有几名运动员去年曾经攀登过苏联境内拔海6，780公尺的十月峰。但是中、苏两国爬山运动员满怀信心地表示：虽然有种种困难，但一定能够征服它。
