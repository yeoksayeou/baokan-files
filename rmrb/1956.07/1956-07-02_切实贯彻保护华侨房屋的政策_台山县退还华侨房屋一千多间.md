Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 1st - The People's Committee of Taishan County, Guangdong Province, has resolutely implemented the policy of protecting overseas Chinese housing. From January to June of this year, a total of 1,187 houses in market towns and rural areas were returned to their owners. At the same time, the remaining balance of rent (after deducting tax payments, repairs, and management fees) from some of the overseas Chinese houses that were managed on behalf of the owners, totaling more than 23,890 yuan, was also returned to the property owners. The twenty-two houses in Baisha Town belonging to the late large merchant Ma Tangzheng were handed over to the Shanlang Township Overseas Chinese Dependents Work Committee for collection and management, and a rental balance of more than 800 yuan was returned. The committee is now awaiting the decision of his family abroad to deal with these properties. The two houses in Gongbian Township belonging to Huang Guangrui, a former senior Kuomintang Air Force officer who had his landlord status changed ahead of time, have also been returned. The Yanxi Hotel, located on Xirong Road, Taicheng Town, which was built with joint investment by overseas Chinese, is currently undergoing procedures for its return and will be temporarily managed by the Taishan County Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese.

These returned overseas Chinese houses were confiscated, requisitioned, taken over, or managed on behalf of the owners during the land reform period. When implementing the overseas Chinese policy, the Taishan County People's Committee, in addition to changing the landlord status of overseas Chinese ahead of schedule, also established county and district (town) overseas Chinese housing handling groups at the beginning of this year, responsible for handling outstanding issues related to overseas Chinese housing.

    新华社广州1日电　广东省台山县人民委员会切实贯彻保护华侨房屋的政策，从今年一月到六月，退还了圩镇和农村的华侨房屋共1，187间给业主，同时还将一部分代管的华侨房屋在代管期间出租的租金余额（租金中扣除了代缴税款、修理和代管费用）共23，890多元，交还了产业所有人。已故大商家马棠政在白沙镇所有的二十二间房屋，交给山蓢乡侨属工作委员会代领代管，并且交回租金余额八百多元。现在，委员会正等待他在外的家人的决定来处理这些产业。已经提前改变地主成份的前国民党空军高级军官黄光锐在龚边乡的两间房屋，也已退还。由华侨集资合股建筑的座落台城镇西荣路的燕喜酒店，现正办理退回手续，它将由台山县归国华侨联谊会暂时代管。
    这些已经退回的华侨房屋，都是在土地改革期间没收、征收或接管、代管的。台山县人民委员会在贯彻执行华侨政策时，除提前改变华侨地主成份外，在今年初还分别成立了县、区（镇）处理华侨房屋小组，负责处理有关华侨房屋的遗留问题。
