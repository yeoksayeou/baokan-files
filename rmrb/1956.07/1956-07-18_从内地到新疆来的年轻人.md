Young People from the Mainland Come to Xinjiang
    Chu Anping

    During my travels in Xinjiang for the past year or so, I have come into contact with many patriotic youths from all over the country in mines, factories, military units, rural areas, and urban organizations. They all possess a courageous spirit that is not afraid of hardship. Although their work is different, their regions are different, and their responsibilities are different, they all love Xinjiang, love the fraternal ethnic groups of Xinjiang, and are loyal to their work posts, dedicating themselves diligently to the socialist cause of the great motherland.

    At the Dushanzi Oil Mine, I met Wang Bingcheng, a young Chinese drilling technician who grew up under the guidance of Soviet experts. After graduating from Peiyang University in 1951, Wang Bingcheng was assigned to work in Dushanzi, along with other university graduates. Upon arriving in Dushanzi, Soviet experts began by specifically guiding them to familiarize themselves with every large and small, coarse and fine operational process of drilling technology from actual work. Wang Bingcheng also helped build derricks and install machines. He learned step by step, which later, after being promoted to drilling technician and then to acting chief engineer of the Dushanzi Oil Mine last year, responsible for leading drilling projects, he realized many profound benefits and meanings. Not only in technology, Wang Bingcheng thus mastered all aspects of drilling engineering, but also, because he labored with the workers, attended meetings together, lived together, wore the same clothes, spoke the same language, and shared the same feelings, he narrowed the distance between himself and the workers, and the workers regarded him as one of their partners. Wang Bingcheng's down-to-earth approach, starting from the basics, promoted other young intellectuals in the mine to follow the same path; after Wang Bingcheng, more young Chinese drilling technicians grew up under the guidance of Soviet experts.

    Before liberation, Xinjiang had no modern industry. In the years since liberation, Urumqi has successively established industries such as iron and steel, electricity, textiles, agricultural tool manufacturing, automobile repair, as well as flour and cement. Many young workers have come from the mainland to support Xinjiang's industrial construction. Like the August 1st Steel Plant, the July 1st Textile Factory, and the Urumqi Agricultural Machinery Plant that I visited, most of the workers are from the mainland. Since its establishment, the August 1st Steel Plant has basically supplied Xinjiang's needs for iron and steel in capital construction, water conservancy projects, agricultural tool manufacturing, and civilian use in recent years. From 1952 to 1955, the Urumqi Agricultural Machinery Plant manufactured a total of 140,000 pieces of large and small agricultural implements, which played a certain role in Xinjiang's agricultural production increase movement in recent years; and 70% of the raw materials for those 140,000 pieces of agricultural implements were supplied by the August 1st Steel Plant. After the establishment of the July 1st Textile Factory, fraternal ethnic groups were able to buy more and cheaper fabrics. Mainland workers coming to Xinjiang not only supported the economic construction of fraternal ethnic groups but also helped fraternal ethnic groups learn production technology. In many factories, many fraternal ethnic workers have grown up with the help of Han workers. When I visited the July 1st Textile Factory, a Uyghur female worker in a weaving workshop, Kulinna, said that her teacher Zhao Fuhua (a Han female worker) not only taught her in the workshop but also went to the dormitory after work to teach her, sometimes teaching very late. Kulinna was able to work independently after learning for three months, and she can now manage twenty-four looms. Another Uyghur female worker in the worsted spinning workshop, Bushayi, said that her teacher Jiang Baolan patiently taught her various operating methods, how to reduce waste, and how to improve work efficiency. Jiang Baolan not only taught her technology but also helped her politically, encouraging her to make contributions and encouraging her to join the Youth League. Now Bushayi can manage six hundred spindles alone. She has joined the trade union, participated in the Urumqi Youth Activists Congress, and joined the Communist Youth League.

    In the Xinjiang Military Region's agricultural production corps, many young people from the mainland are also participating in various production and construction projects. When I visited the Daquangou Reservoir construction site in the Manas River Basin, I met several Shandong girls who came to work in Xinjiang in 1952 in response to the government's call. They originally had little education and had never been exposed to machinery, but now they have become very good tractor drivers. One of them, Zhou Changlan, encountered many difficulties when learning to drive a tractor. What "guide wheel" for the front wheel, "driving wheel" for the rear wheel, and what "front and rear axles," "middle axles," just the names alone made her dizzy. But despite the many difficulties, she finally learned successfully. Another female tractor team leader, Li Qingyun, not only learned to drive a tractor but also learned to drive an excavator. The group she led was famous at the Daquangou Reservoir construction site at the time: good unity, good division of labor, good work quality, good machine maintenance, and few accidents. Li Qingyun said: "Thinking back to when I was in Shandong, I was just an ordinary woman. After coming to Xinjiang, under the education of the Party, I am now able to drive modern agricultural machinery to participate in the country's construction. This will always make me feel comforted and proud!"

    In Altay, Tacheng, Yili, Urumqi, Turpan, and various places in southern Xinjiang, there are young people from the mainland who have specialized in agriculture and have gone deep into the countryside to help local farmers improve various agricultural techniques. In the three places of Kashgar, Yecheng, and Hotan in southern Xinjiang alone, I have met graduates from four schools: Zhejiang Agricultural College, Central China Agricultural College, Southwest Agricultural College, and Northwest Agricultural College. In Turpan's Grape Valley, I once met a young agricultural technician who was responsible for the technical guidance of the entire Grape Valley, and if he didn't understand the language, he had to learn it. Their hard work has contributed to the improvement of Xinjiang's agricultural production in recent years. In the Hotan area, there is also a group of cadres specializing in sericulture who came from Jiangnan, some of whom are graduates of the Suzhou Hushu Pass Sericulture School. Some of them work in the Hotan Silk Reeling Factory, some work in the Hotan Sericulture Experimental Station, and some go directly into the countryside to help farmers raise silkworms. In 1955, the average cocoon yield per box of silkworm eggs (18 cm packaging) for ordinary farmers in Hotan County was 31 jin, but in key cooperative societies guided by sericulture cadres, the average yield per box was 50 jin, with the highest reaching 75 jin. This shows that their work has been successful.

    Many girls from Shanghai, especially in the past year or two, have come to Xinjiang. Some of them work in medical and health positions. I stayed in the military region hospital in Urumqi for a while, and most of the nurses there were from Shanghai. A larger proportion of Shanghai girls work in the financial and trade systems. In Xinjiang, no matter where you go, you will meet these young, lively, and beautiful Shanghai girls in trade companies and department stores. Their strengths are their cleverness and carefulness, which are very suitable for sales, accounting, and statistics work. This group of seventeen- or eighteen-year-old girls from Jiangnan has become an important force in Xinjiang's commercial system. In addition, these girls have also enlivened a part of the local social life. If this "new force" participates in dances, the venue will be even more lively.

    Of course, there are also many young people from the mainland who hold positions in government administration and Party work in Xinjiang. Among them, special mention should be made of many district committee secretaries. Xinjiang is vast, and often one county is larger than a prefecture in the mainland, and one district is larger than a county in the mainland. It often takes two or three days to ride a horse from one end of a district to the other. On such a large area of land, all the publicity and communication of the Party's policies and guidelines, as well as the deployment, promotion, and inspection of tasks stipulated by higher authorities, must be carried out through and rely on this one district committee secretary. There are no translators in the district organization, and the district committee secretary has to force himself to learn Uyghur even if he doesn't understand it, otherwise he cannot work. The district committee secretary is either in the countryside or in the pastoral areas, and his lifestyle must be localized. These district committee secretaries are loyal to the Party's cause and wholeheartedly serve the border construction and the fraternal ethnic groups, year after year. Not many people know them, but they do a lot of work.

    These young men and women from all over the country who have come to Xinjiang to build the frontier mostly praise and are satisfied with Xinjiang's scenery and life. They are all willing to work in Xinjiang for a long time, and under the education of the Party and Chairman Mao's ethnic policies, they are all able to respect the local ethnic customs and habits and unite well with the fraternal ethnic groups. Thanks to their joint efforts with the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang, Xinjiang has made great achievements in various aspects of construction in recent years, and the entire face of Xinjiang has been completely renewed. At the same time, these brave and promising patriotic youths have also grown up healthily in practical training.

    从内地到新疆来的年轻人
    储安平
    这一年多我在新疆旅行，无论在矿山、工厂、部队、农村或者城市机关，都接触到很多来自祖国各地的爱国青年。他们都具有不辞艰苦的勇敢精神。虽然各人的工作不同、所在的地区不同、担负的责任不同，但他们都热爱新疆，热爱新疆的兄弟民族，忠实于自己的工作岗位，兢兢业业地献身于伟大祖国的社会主义事业。
    我在独山子油矿会见了在苏联专家培养下成长起来的中国青年钻井技师王炳诚。1951年王炳诚在北洋大学毕业以后，被分配到独山子工作；和他一起到的还有其他一些大学毕业生。他们到独山子后，苏联专家一开头就具体指导他们从实际的工作中熟悉了钻井技术每一个大小粗细的操作过程。王炳诚也搭过井架，安装过机器。他按步就班地一步一步学，使他后来在升任为钻井技师、去年又升任为独山子油矿的代理总工程师、担任了钻井工程的领导工作以后，体会到许多深刻的益处和意义。不仅在技术上，王炳诚因此掌握了钻井工程的全部环节，而且，由于他和工人在一起劳动，一起开会，一起生活，穿一样的衣服，讲一样的语言，怀着同样的感情，因而缩小了他和工人之间的距离，工人把他看成了自己的一个伙伴。王炳诚这种从根本做起的踏实作风，推动了矿上其他一些青年知识分子，使大家后来也都走了同样的道路；在王炳诚以后，又有更多的中国青年钻井技师在苏联专家的培养下成长了起来。
    解放以前，新疆没有现代工业。解放后这几年，乌鲁木齐陆续建立了钢铁、电力、纺织、农具制造、汽车修配以及面粉、水泥等工业。很多青年工人从内地前来支援新疆的工业建设。像我访问过的八一钢铁厂、七一纺织厂和乌鲁木齐农业机械厂，大部分的工人都是从内地来的。八一钢铁厂建立以后，它基本上供应了这几年新疆在基本建设、水利工程、农具制造以及民用方面的钢铁需要。乌鲁木齐农业机械厂从1952年到1955年一共制造了大小农具十四万件，对于这几年新疆农业的增产运动起了一定的作用；而那十四万件农具70％的原料，也就是八一钢铁厂供给的。七一纺织厂建立以后，使兄弟民族能够买到更多更便宜的布匹。内地工人到新疆来不仅支援了兄弟民族的经济建设，而且还帮助了兄弟民族学会生产技术。在许多工厂里，很多兄弟民族工人在汉族工人的帮助下成长了起来。我在七一纺织厂访问时，一个织布车间的维族女工库里娜说，她的老师赵富华（汉族女工）不仅在车间教她，下工后还到宿舍里去教她，有时教到很晚很晚。库里娜学了三个月就能独立工作，她现在已经能管二十四台织布机。另一个精纺车间的维族女工布沙衣说，她的老师姜保兰耐心地教她各种操作方法，教她怎样才能少出废花，怎样才能提高工作效率。姜保兰不仅教她技术，还在政治上帮助她，鼓励她立功，鼓励她入团。现在布沙衣可以一个人管六百个纱锭。她参加了工会，参加过乌鲁木齐的青年积极分子大会，并且加入了青年团。
    在新疆军区农业生产部队里，也有很多从内地来的青年参加着各项生产建设。当我在玛纳斯河流域大泉沟水库工地参观的时候，会见了好几个在1952年响应政府号召到新疆来工作的山东姑娘。她们本来没有什么文化，也从来没有接触过机器，可是现在她们都成了很好的拖拉机手。有一个叫周长兰的，她在学习驾驶拖拉机的时候，遇到很多困难。什么前轮叫“引导轮”、后轮叫“主动轮”，又是什么“前后横轴”、“中横轴”，单单这些名字就把她搞得脑头昏胀。但是困难虽多，她终于还是学成功了。另外一个女拖拉机组长李庆云，不仅学会了驾驶拖拉机，还学过驾驶挖土机。她所领导的一个组在当时的大泉沟水库工地上是有名的：团结好，分工好，工作质量好，机器保养好，而且事故少。李庆云说：“回想我在山东的时候，不过是一个普通妇女。到了新疆以后，在党的教育下，我也能够驾驶着现代化的农业机器来参加国家的建设了。这将永远使我感到安慰和自豪！”
    在阿勒泰、塔城、伊犁、乌鲁木齐、吐鲁番以及南疆各地，都有专门学农的内地青年深入农村，帮助当地农民改进各项农业技术。仅在南疆的喀什、叶城、和阗三个地方，我就见过浙江农学院、华中农学院、西南农学院和西北农学院四个学校的毕业生。在吐鲁番葡萄沟、我曾经遇到一个农业技术青年，他一个人负责整个葡萄沟的技术指导，不懂得话，还要学话。他们的艰苦的劳动，对于这几年来新疆农业生产的提高是有贡献的。在和阗地区，还有一批从江南来的蚕桑干部，其中一部分是苏州浒墅关蚕桑学校毕业的。她们有的在和阗缫丝厂工作，有的在和阗蚕桑试验站工作，有的就直接深入乡间帮助农民育蚕。1955年和阗县一般农民平均每盒蚕种（十八公分装）产茧三十一市斤，但是有蚕桑干部指导的重点社，平均每盒产茧五十市斤，其中最高的达到七十五市斤。这说明她们的工作是有成绩的。
    上海的女孩子，特别在最近一两年来新疆的很多。她们有一部分工作在医药卫生岗位上。我曾在乌鲁木齐的军区医院住过一个时候，那儿的护士绝大部分都是从上海来的。上海女孩子更大部分是在财经贸易系统工作。在新疆，无论到什么地方，在贸易公司、百货公司这些单位里，你都会遇见这些年青活泼美丽的上海姑娘。她们的长处是机灵细心，很适合于作售货以及会计、统计等工作。这一批十七八岁的江南姑娘成了目前新疆商业系统的一支重要的力量。此外，这些女孩子还活跃了当地的一部分社会生活。举行舞会要是有了这一批“生力军”参加，会场就更显得欢腾活跃。
    当然，还有很多从内地来的青年在新疆担任了机关行政工作和党的工作。其中应该特别提到的是许多区委书记同志。新疆地方辽阔，常常一个县比内地的一个专区还大，一个区比内地的一个县还大。从一个区的这头到那头，常常要骑马走上两三天。就在这样一大片地面上，所有关于党的政策方针的宣传、传达，以及上级规定的任务的布置、推动和检查，都要通过并依靠这一个区委书记。区的编制中没有翻译，区委书记不懂维文也得硬逼着学，否则就无法工作。区委书记不是在农村，就是在牧区，生活作风还得民族化。这些区委书记，忠于党的事业，全心全意地为边疆建设服务，为兄弟民族服务，数年如一日。知道他们的人不多，但他们做的工作却不少。
    这些从祖国各地到新疆来建设边疆的青年男女，大都赞美、满意新疆的风光生活。他们都安心在新疆长期工作下去，在党和毛主席的民族政策教育下，他们都能够尊重当地民族的风俗习惯，并且和兄弟民族团结得很好。靠了他们和全新疆各族人民的共同努力，这几年新疆在各方面的建设工作都有很大的成绩，整个新疆的面貌已是焕然一新。同时，这些勇敢有为的爱国青年，他们自己在实际的锻练中也茁壮地成长了起来。
