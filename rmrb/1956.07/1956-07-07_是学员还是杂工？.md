    Trainees or Handymen?
    We are young and middle-aged workers from the mechanical repair shop of the jointly owned public-private Qixin Cement Company. In March of this year, we were transferred to the factory's cultural training class. We heard from the leaders that the reason for transferring us to study was because our factory's labor productivity had increased, resulting in a surplus of labor.
    We were happy to study culture. However, after three months in school, what have we learned? It is heartbreaking to talk about. The progress in learning geometry and Chinese is much slower than that of the workers' spare-time cultural classes. We are often taken away to support others: sweeping the factory roads, helping the Taiyuan Engineering Company's Tangshan Engineering Office to carry earth, engaging in the factory's greening work, filling out forms and copying things for the sections, and going to the club to help write wall newspapers or do some odd jobs... So everyone calls the training office the "Labor Allocation Department" and calls themselves "omnipotent college students." Because we often go to "voluntary labor," sometimes the teachers come to class without students, and sometimes the students are there but the teachers are not.
    There are more than 600 workers in the whole school living this life of neither producing nor learning, including more than 90 skilled workers. We are here taking 100% of our wages, wasting valuable time, and the production skills we originally knew are becoming increasingly unfamiliar. We have raised this issue with the factory leaders, and the answer we received was: Just study culture peacefully!
    The national socialist construction cause is advancing by leaps and bounds. We request: transfer us to support other enterprises! If not, overcome the shortcomings in organizing the learning and do a good job in the training work in name and in fact.

    是学员还是杂工？
    我们是公私合营启新水泥公司机械修配厂青壮年工人，今年三月被调到我们厂文化培训班学习。听领导上说，所以调我们学习，是因为我们厂劳动生产率提高了，劳动力有剩余。
    学习文化我们是高兴的。可是，入校三个月了，学了些什么呢，提起来令人痛心。学习几何、语文的进度比工人业余文化补习班慢得多。我们却常被拿去支援别人：打扫工厂的马路，帮助太原工程公司唐山工程处抬土，搞全厂的绿化工作，给科里填表格和抄东西，去俱乐部帮助写墙报或做些杂活……。于是大家把培训办公室称作“劳动力调配处”，称呼自己是“万能大学生”。因为我们常去“义务劳动”，有时是老师来上课没有学生，有时学生在老师又不到。
    全校有六百多名工人过这种既不能生产、又不能学习的生活，其中有九十多名技术工人。我们就在这里百分之百地拿工资，虚度可贵的光阴，原来懂得的生产技术也日益生疏了。为这件事我们给厂的领导人员提过意见，得到的回答是：叫你们学文化，就安心学吧！
    全国社会主义建设事业正突飞猛进，我们要求：把我们调出去支援别的企业吧。不的话，就克服组织学习上的缺点，名符其实地做好培训工作。
