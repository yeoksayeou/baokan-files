Xinhua News Agency, 8th. It is a major and crucial issue for promoting the cause of agricultural cooperation to conscientiously do a good job in this year's summer harvest distribution. This is pointed out in the CCP Central Committee's recent instructions on the issue of summer harvest distribution.

The CCP Central Committee's instructions point out that this year's summer harvest is the first product distribution after the basic agricultural cooperation. If the income of 90% of the members can be guaranteed to increase in the case of increased production in the cooperative, it will be of great significance for encouraging the production enthusiasm of the members and consolidating the cooperative. Therefore, all localities must conscientiously do a good job in this year's summer harvest distribution, and earnestly and properly handle several issues with universality in this year's summer harvest distribution.

Regarding the issue of "who sows, who harvests" and unified distribution, the instructions point out that after the great development of cooperatives and the merger of elementary cooperatives into advanced cooperatives, if it was agreed at the time of joining the cooperative that wheat and other spring harvest crops originally belonging to small cooperatives or individual farmers would be distributed according to "who sows, who harvests," then they should still be distributed according to "who sows, who harvests." Cooperatives that did not clearly stipulate the distribution method or had agreed to unified distribution in the past should, in principle, maintain unified distribution. However, if the original small cooperatives and new members firmly request "who sows, who harvests," it can also be handled flexibly, and unified distribution should not be forcibly implemented, so as not to affect unity within the cooperative. However, when implementing this temporary method of "who sows, who harvests," corresponding solutions should be formulated for the labor and costs spent by the cooperative in the wheat fields, the summer agricultural tax, and unified purchase. It is also feasible for some provinces and cities to implement unified distribution, but give certain considerations to new members with more wheat fields.

The instructions emphasize that no matter which distribution method is implemented, it is necessary to fully work among the new and old members to make them agree, so as to achieve the purpose of uniting production.

The instructions say that the issue of "less deduction and more distribution" or "more deduction and less distribution" should also be handled under the principle of ensuring that the income of 90% of the members increases. The agricultural tax that the cooperative uniformly pays to the state and the wheat seeds needed for sowing wheat after autumn must be set aside, except for the cooperatives that have suffered disasters; an appropriate amount of welfare funds should also be retained to take care of the lives of the "five guarantees" households. The production expenses needed by the cooperative before autumn should be handled flexibly according to the summer income of each cooperative, without affecting the increase in income of the members. If deducting these funds makes it impossible for the members' income to increase compared to the past, then deduct less as appropriate, and try to solve the shortfall from sideline production or other aspects.

The instructions emphasize that, estimating the current actual situation, party committees at all levels should adhere to the principle of "less deduction and more distribution" in order to guarantee the requirement that the income of 90% of the members increases.

Regarding the issue of repaying the overdue loans of credit cooperatives, the instructions say that overdue loans should be repaid. However, considering that the cooperative has just been established, if the cooperative and its members are indeed unable to repay, and the investigation proves it to be true, they should also be allowed to repay less or postpone the repayment according to the different uses of the loans.

The CCP Central Committee instructed all localities to clear the work points of the members. If the labor work points between the production teams in a cooperative are unbalanced and the difference is large, they should be compared between the teams and appropriately revised. The issue of work point subsidies for cadres' work delays should be properly handled according to the nature of the work delays.

    中共中央指示各级党委切实做好夏收分配
    坚持少扣多分的原则
    保证90％的农业生产合作社社员增加收入
    新华社8日讯　切实做好今年的夏收分配工作，是当前推动农业合作化事业前进的重大关键问题。这是中共中央最近发出的关于夏收分配问题的指示中指出的。
    中共中央指示指出，今年的夏收是农业基本合作化后的第一次产品分配，如果在合作社增产的情况下保证90％的社员增加收入，这对于鼓舞社员的生产情绪和巩固合作社，都有极大的意义。因此，各地必须切实做好今年的夏收分配工作，对于今年夏收分配中带有普遍性的几个问题，要认真地妥善地加以处理。
    关于谁种谁收和统一分配的问题，指示指出，在合作社大发展和由初级社合并为高级社后，原属于小社或属于单干农民播种的小麦和其他春收作物，如果在入社时就议定了谁种谁收，现在就仍按谁种谁收进行分配。原来没有明确规定分配方法或曾经议定统一分配的社，原则上维持统一分配，但是如果原来的小社和新社员坚决要求谁种谁收时，也可以灵活处理，不要硬性实行统一分配，以免影响社内团结。但是，在实行谁种谁收这种临时办法的时候，对于合作社在麦田里所费的工本、夏季农业税和统购等等问题，应该定出相应的解决办法。有些省、市虽然实行了统一分配，但是给予麦田较多的新社员一定的照顾，这也是可行的。
    指示强调，无论实行那一种分配办法，都必须在新老社员中间充分做好工作，使新老社员都能同意，以便达到团结生产的目的。
    指示中说，关于“少扣多分”或“多扣少分”的问题，也应该在保证90％的社员增加收入的原则下进行处理。社向国家统一交纳的农业税和秋后种麦所需的麦种，除了遭灾的社以外必须留足；用于照顾五保户生活的公益金也要留适当数量。合作社在秋前所需要的生产费用，则应该根据各社夏季收入的情况，在不影响社员增加收入的前提下灵活处理。如果因扣除这些资金而使得社员收入不能比过去增加时，那就酌情少扣，不足部分再设法从副业生产或其他方面解决。
    指示强调，估计到目前的实际情况，各级党委应该坚持“少扣多分”原则才能保证90％的社员增加收入的要求。
    关于归还信用合作社到期的贷款问题，指示说，到期的贷款应该归还，但是，鉴于合作社刚建立不久，如果合作社和社员确实无力偿还，经调查属实，也应该分别贷款的不同用途，允许少还或缓期归还。
    中共中央指示各地要清理社员的劳动工分。对于一个社内各生产队之间劳动工分不平衡，相差悬殊的，应该在各队之间进行比较，适当地加以修正。对于干部误工的工分补贴问题，应该分别误工性质，妥善地加以处理。
