    Organize Farmers to Collect Medicinal Herbs
    Recently, when we went to Zhaojiachang Township in Yongqing County, Hebei Province, to understand the development of diverse economic activities in agricultural production cooperatives, Jia Tinggui, a veteran member of the Jiguang Agricultural Cooperative, raised the issue of organizing the collection of medicinal herbs.
    He said: There are inexhaustible resources in the countryside. Like mulberry leaves, mulberry bark, Chinese toon bark, phoenix eye grass (Chinese toon seeds), locust flowers, locust rice, plantain seeds, red fairy grass, dandelion, motherwort, mantis eggs, cicada molts, hedgehog skin, etc., are all very important medicinal materials. Among them, the despised hedgehog skin can sell for 1.2 yuan per catty. These medicinal materials are not only available in Yongqing County (more than 100 kinds can be collected), but also in other places. There are also Sha Yuanzi produced on both sides of the Ziya River and in the Weinan Depression, large green leaves produced in Baiyangdian, and lotus roots, cattail pollen, lotus leaves, lotus stalks, and gorgon fruit produced in Sanjiaodian, which are also medicinal materials. If members can be mobilized to collect them, there can be a large income. This year, the Jiguang Agricultural Cooperative mobilized the elderly and women to collect 16 kinds of medicinal materials, which can be sold for more than 10,000 yuan.
    We believe that after the realization of cooperation in rural areas, conditions have been created for carrying out diversified operations. Paying attention to organizing members to collect medicinal materials can not only increase the income of the cooperative, but also find work for members who cannot do heavy work. At the same time, it is also beneficial to national construction and people's health. We hope that the Party and government leading organs in various places will attach importance to and lead this work, and also hope that the supply and marketing cooperatives and pharmaceutical companies can tell the farmers what medicinal materials are needed and the purchase price, and give the farmers medicinal material specimens to look at, so as to enable the work of collecting medicinal materials to be carried out smoothly.

### 组织农民采药材

    组织农民采药材
    最近，我们到河北永清县赵家场乡了解农业生产合作社发展多种经济情况的时候，集光农业社的老社员贾廷贵，曾向我们提出组织采集药材的问题。
    他说：农村有开发不尽的资源。像桑叶、桑皮、椿树皮、凤眼草（椿树子）、槐花、槐米、车前子、红仙草、蒲公英、益母草、螳螂子、蝉蜕、刺猬皮等，就都是很重要的药材。其中被人们看不起的刺猬皮，每斤能卖到一元二角。这些药材，不仅永清县有（能采集一百多种），别的地方也有。还有子牙河两岸和卫南洼出的沙元子，白洋淀出的大青叶，三角淀出的藕节、蒲黄、莲叶、莲梗、鸡头子等，也都是药材。如果能发动社员采集，就可以有很大的收入。集光农业社今年发动老人和妇女采集的十六种药材，就能卖一万多元。
    我们认为：农村实现合作化后，给开展多种经营创造了条件。注意组织社员采集药材，不仅可以增加合作社的收入，还能给干不了重活的社员找到活干。同时，对国家建设和人民健康也有好处。我们希望各地党政领导机关重视并领导开展这一工作，还希望供销合作社和医药公司能把所需要的药材和收购价格告诉农民，并拿药材标本给农民看，以便使采集药材的工作顺利开展起来。
