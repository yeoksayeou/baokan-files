Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, 26th. By July 20th, the annual procurement plans for "Qihong" and "Tunlv," two famous export teas accounting for more than one-third of Anhui Province's tea production, had been overfulfilled. The total procurement volume increased by more than 23% compared to the same period last year. The market supply of these famous teas is still substantial, with daily purchases reaching around 800 dan.

　　This year, agricultural cooperativization was realized in the "Qihong" and "Tunlv" production areas. Tea farmers changed their past habits of neglecting weeding and fertilization in the spring. This spring, 90% of the tea gardens were weeded, and a general application of fertilizer was carried out. The amount of chemical fertilizer applied in major tea-producing counties such as Qimen, Shexian, and Xiuning increased by about five times compared to last year. Before the summer tea came on the market, tea farmers strengthened the management of tea gardens. The area of summer weeding and fertilization was greater than in any previous year. As a result, both spring and summer teas achieved bumper harvests this year, with a total output increase of about one-quarter compared to last year.

    安徽的两种名茶收购计划超额完成
    新华社合肥26日电　到七月二十日止，占安徽省茶产量三分之一以上的“祁红”、“屯绿”两种外销名茶的全年收购计划，都已经超额完成，收购数量共比去年同期增加23％以上。这些名茶的上市量现在仍旧很大，每天可以收购八百担左右。
      “祁红”、“屯绿”产区今年实现了农业合作化，植茶农民改变了历来在春季不注意锄草、施肥的习惯，今春在90％的茶园锄了草，普遍追施了一次肥料，祁门、歙县和休宁等主要产茶县追施的化学肥料约比去年增加五倍。在夏茶上市以前，植茶农民又加强了茶园管理，夏季除草、施肥的面积比过去任何一年都多。因此今年的春茶夏茶都获得大丰收，总产量约比去年增加四分之一。
