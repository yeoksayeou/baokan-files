Xinhua News Agency, July 3rd, dispatch from TASS: Soviet Chairman of the Council of Ministers, Bulganin, and First Secretary of the Central Committee of the CPSU, Khrushchev, separately received former Cambodian Prime Minister Sihanouk on July 3rd.

Accompanying Sihanouk at the reception were Cambodian Prime Minister Khim Tit and his entourage.

Xinhua News Agency, July 3rd, dispatch from TASS: When Prince Sihanouk arrived in Moscow on July 2nd, he said, "We have come to the Soviet Union with the endorsement of all the Cambodian people. Our people place their best hopes on establishing solid and close relations with the Soviet Union."

"Our people believe that without reaching friendly and sincere agreements with the Soviet Union, there can be no talk of peace or a lasting easing of international tension."

"To realize this desire, I have come here to study with the Soviet leaders the ways to enable our two peoples to better understand each other and to establish trust relations in all aspects, based on respect for our sovereignty."

The former Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Cambodia also said at the Moscow airport: Cambodia, which has been completely independent since November 1953, has freely and autonomously chosen the path of neutrality. It has taken this position because of its long and often tragic experience. It does so also out of a love for peace. Precisely for this reason, it solemnly upholds the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and carefully fulfills all the obligations stipulated in the 1954 Geneva Accords, which have brought it the security it desires.

Sihanouk emphasized: "Our neutrality is neither imposed on us by others nor is it passive. Its purpose is to strengthen our independence—the fruit of countless sacrifices, and to serve our national interests."

"The Cambodian people long for progress and peace, and are determined, together with other kind people, to do their modest best to ensure that tomorrow's world is not destroyed and devoid of hostility."

On the same day, Sihanouk, accompanied by Cambodian Prime Minister Khim Tit and National Assembly Speaker Ung Hong Sath, met with Voroshilov, Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union.

    苏联领导人接见西哈努克
    西哈努克说柬埔寨要同苏联建立密切关系
    新华社3日讯　据塔斯社报道：苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁和苏共中央第一书记赫鲁晓夫，在七月三日分别接见了柬埔寨前首相西哈努克。
    陪同西哈努克受接见的有柬埔寨首相钦·迪和随行人员。
    新华社3日讯　据塔斯社报道：西哈努克亲王七月二日到达莫斯科的时候说，“我们是得到全体柬埔寨人民的赞同前来苏联的。我国人民把最好的希望寄托在同苏联建立巩固而密切的关系上。”
    “我国人民认为，不同苏联达成友好和真诚的协议，既谈不上和平，也谈不上有持久的国际紧张局势的缓和。”
    “为了实现这种愿望，我就来到这里，以便同苏联领导人研究使我们两国人民能够更好地相互了解的方法，并且在尊重我们主权的基础上，在各方面建立信任关系。”
    这位柬埔寨王国前首相在莫斯科飞机场上还说：从1953年11月起已经完全独立的柬埔寨，自由地和自主地选择了中立的道路。它所以采取这种立场，是由于它的长时期的和往往是悲惨的经历。它这样做还出于对和平的热爱。正因为这样，它郑重地拥护和平共处的五项原则，周到地履行着1954年日内瓦协定所规定的一切义务，这个协定为它带来了它所渴望的安全。
    西哈努克强调说：“我们采取的中立，既不是别人强迫我们接受的，也不是消极的。它的目的是加强我国的独立——我们作了无数牺牲而得来的果实，为我国的民族利益服务。”
    “柬埔寨人民渴望进步和和平，并且抱定决心要同其他善良人民一起，竭尽自己的微薄力量，使明天的世界不致遭到破坏和没有仇视。”
    当天，西哈努克由柬埔寨首相钦·迪和国民会议议长翁谦山陪同，会见了苏联最高苏维埃主席团主席伏罗希洛夫。
