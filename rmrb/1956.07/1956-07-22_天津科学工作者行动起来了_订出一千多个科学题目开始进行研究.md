Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, July 21st: Scientific workers in Tianjin have recently formulated more than 1,100 scientific research topics.

	About half of these scientific research topics are in the fields of natural sciences and technical sciences. Teachers at Tianjin University and engineering technicians at factories such as the jointly owned Yongli Jiuda Chemical Industry Company's Dagukou Factory have drawn up more than 140 scientific research topics in areas such as marine chemistry, inorganic chemistry, electrochemistry, metal chemistry, fiber chemistry, organic chemistry, and polymer chemistry. Physicists at Nankai University and Tianjin University have already begun research on semiconductor photoelectric tubes, high-energy particle showers, and atomic nuclear density distribution, and research on issues such as the cosmic ray transition effect will also begin soon.

	More than 190 medical research topics, formulated by over 200 senior medical personnel, have mostly begun to be studied. Orthopedic expert Fang Xianzhi plans to study the etiology of rheumatoid arthritis and Kashin-Beck disease by combining disease investigation, experiments, and clinical observations. These are some of the most difficult problems currently in the world of medicine. The research on menstrual physiology and functional disorders of the female reproductive organs being conducted by obstetrics and gynecology experts Yu Aifeng and Lin Song is also an important issue in obstetrics and gynecology research in various countries today. They are seeking information on female endocrinology; the relationship between menstrual physiology and functional disorders of the female reproductive organs; and attempting to improve diagnostic methods and use traditional Chinese medicine for regulating menstruation, endocrine preparations, etc. to improve treatment efficiency. Thoracic surgery experts Zhang Jizheng and Zhang Tianhui are conducting research to improve the surgical treatment techniques for common thoracic surgical conditions such as pulmonary tuberculosis and lung abscess. Urological surgery experts Shi Xien and Yu Songting are studying tuberculosis of the reproductive and urinary systems.

	Scientific workers in the fields of social sciences, philosophy, language and literature have formulated more than 400 scientific research topics in areas such as economics, history, language and literature, education, psychology, and philosophy. Some of these research topics have already completed their initial drafts.

    天津科学工作者行动起来了
    订出一千多个科学题目开始进行研究
    新华社天津21日电　在天津的科学工作者最近制订出一千一百多个科学研究题目。
    在这些科学研究题目中，约有半数是自然科学和技术科学方面的。天津大学的教师和公私合营永利久大化学工业公司沽厂等工厂的工程技术人员，订出了一百四十多个海洋化学、无机化学、电化学、金属化学、纤维化学、有机化学、高分子化学等方面的科学研究题目。南开大学和天津大学的物理学家们已经开始了关于半导体光电管、高能粒子簇射和原子核密度分布等的研究，宇宙线过渡效应等问题的研究也即将开始。
    由二百多名高级医务人员制订的一百九十多个医学研究题目，很多已经开始进行研究。骨科专家方先之，准备用病情调查、实验和临床观察相结合的方法研究类风湿性关节炎和大骨节病病因学。这都是世界医学界目前最难解决的问题。妇产科专家俞霭峰、林崧等进行的月经生理和女性生殖器功能疾患的研究，也是目前世界各国妇产科研究的重要问题。她们正在寻求关于女性内分泌；月经生理同女性生殖器功能性疾患之间的关系；企图改进诊断方法并且应用中药调经药品、内分泌素制剂等来提高治疗效率。胸外科专家张纪正、张天惠正在进行胸外科中常见的肺结核病、肺化脓症等外科治疗技术改进的研究。泌尿外科专家施锡恩、虞颂庭正在研究生殖泌尿系统的结核病。
    社会科学、哲学、语言文学等方面的科学工作者们制订了四百多个关于经济、历史、语言文学、教育、心理和哲学等方面的科学研究题目。其中有一些研究题目已经完成了初稿。
