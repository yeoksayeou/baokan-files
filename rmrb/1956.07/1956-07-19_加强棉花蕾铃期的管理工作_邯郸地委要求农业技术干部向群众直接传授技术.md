Xinhua News Agency, Baoding, 16th: Recently, the Handan Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party conducted an inspection of the technical guidance work for promoting the large-scale high-yield experience of Xinjiang cotton, helping some agricultural technicians establish the ideological viewpoints of "relying on the masses" and "proceeding from reality." The Handan Prefectural Committee also determined that all agricultural technicians should go deep into the fields and among the masses in the future to strengthen the direct imparting of techniques. When imparting techniques, they must formulate local technical operating procedures for the cotton bud and boll stage based on the local cotton growth situation, farmers' cultivation level, and conditions of labor, livestock, farm implements, and financial resources, inviting experienced farmers to participate.

The Handan area is the main cotton-producing area of Hebei Province. This year, more than 3.27 million mu of cotton were sown, and the large-scale high-yield experience of Xinjiang cotton was fully promoted for the first time. Before sowing, the Handan Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party convened cadres from agricultural departments and relevant units, as well as agricultural technicians sent by the Agricultural Production and Construction Corps of the Xinjiang Military Region, to conduct repeated research. The results showed that the local climate, rainfall, soil quality, farmers' planting habits, and yield-increasing experience were all suitable for promoting the large-scale high-yield experience of Xinjiang cotton. In particular, Xinjiang's mulching, early sowing, early inter-tillage, early seedling setting, and early topdressing techniques could just solve the problems in the Handan area, where sowing was often delayed due to spring drought, resulting in weak seedlings in the seedling stage, easy susceptibility to pests and diseases, late budding stage, and shedding of two-thirds of the cotton bolls during the rainy season.

When sowing began, natural conditions changed. The rainfall in April reached more than 24 millimeters, which was five times more than the same period in previous years. The ground was wet, and the ground temperature was low. According to this favorable soil moisture condition, which is rare to see in ten years, most areas appropriately changed from drought-resistant deep sowing to shallow sowing, so the seedling emergence was good. Now the cotton plants in these areas are generally about one chi tall, and the better ones are one chi seven or eight cun tall. Each plant has more than a dozen flower buds, and most have already blossomed and set bolls. Agricultural production cooperatives in various places are thoroughly controlling cotton aphids, topdressing, earthing up, weeding after rain, and pruning to strengthen cotton bud and boll management and strive for a bountiful harvest.

However, the cotton in some individual areas is currently not growing well. The cotton plants are less than one chi tall, some have just appeared flower buds, and some have not yet had flower buds. These are mostly cotton fields that were heavily replanted, re-sown, and improperly managed during the seedling stage. The main reason is that some agricultural technicians disregarded changes in natural conditions, did not pay attention to local specific conditions, and did not combine farmers' experience, rigidly promoting Xinjiang's cotton planting techniques. This wrong attitude has been criticized.

### 加强棉花蕾铃期的管理工作  邯郸地委要求农业技术干部向群众直接传授技术

    加强棉花蕾铃期的管理工作
    邯郸地委要求农业技术干部向群众直接传授技术
    新华社保定16日电　最近中共邯郸地方委员会对于推广新疆棉花大面积丰产经验的技术指导工作作了检查，帮助一些农业技术干部树立“依靠群众”、“从实际出发”的思想观点。中共邯郸地方委员会还确定：今后所有农业技术干部都应该深入田间，深入群众，加强直接传授技术；传授技术的时候，必须根据当地棉花生育情况，农民耕作水平和劳力、畜力、农具、财力等条件，邀请有经验的农民共同制定当地的棉花蕾铃期技术操作规程。
    邯郸专区是河北省的主要产棉区，今年播种棉花三百二十七万多亩，第一次全面推广新疆的棉花大面积丰产经验。播种前，中共邯郸地方委员会召集农业部门和有关单位的干部，以及新疆军区农业生产建设部队派来的农业技术人员，再三作了研究。结果认为，当地气候、雨量、土质、农民的种植习惯和增产经验，都适宜于推广新疆的棉花大面积丰产经验；尤其是新疆的焖种、早播、早中耕、早定苗、早追肥等技术，正好可以解决邯郸专区往年常常因春旱推迟播种而造成苗期幼苗不壮，易受病虫害威胁，现蕾期晚，雨季三分之二棉铃脱落等问题。
    播种开始的时候，自然情况起了变化。四月份降雨量达二十四公厘以上，比往年同期多五倍。地湿，地温低。根据这种十年九不遇的良好墒情，大部地区都适当地改抗旱深播为浅播，因此出苗情况良好。现在这些地区的棉株普遍长到一尺左右高，好的有一尺七、八寸高。每株挂花蕾十多个，多数已经开花座桃。各地农业生产合作社正在彻底除治棉蚜、追肥、培土、雨后除草和整枝，加强棉花蕾铃期管理，争取丰硕的收成。
    但是，也有个别地区的棉花目前生育情况不好，棉株还不到一尺高，有的刚出现花蕾，有的还没有花蕾。这些大多是春季重种、补种和苗期管理不当的那些棉田。原因主要是一些农业技术干部不顾自然情况的变化，不注意当地具体条件和不结合农民的经验，生硬地推广新疆的植棉技术。这种错误的态度已经受到了批判。
