Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, July 20th. The Special Military Tribunal of the Supreme People's Court of the People's Republic of China conducted a trial in Shenyang from July 1st to 20th of twenty-eight Japanese war criminals, including Takebe Rokuzo.

During the war of Japanese imperialism's invasion of our country, these twenty-eight Japanese war criminals held various military and political positions in the administrative, judicial, and police organs and the gendarmerie of the puppet Manchukuo. The court trial confirmed that these twenty-eight war criminals, in different capacities, committed various serious crimes, including actively implementing the policies of Japanese imperialism to invade our country, supporting Japanese imperialism's war of aggression against our country, manipulating or participating in the manipulation of the puppet Manchukuo government, usurping our country's sovereignty, and violating the norms of international law and humanitarian principles. The court finally sentenced them to fixed-term imprisonment ranging from twelve to twenty years.

Jia Qian, President of the Special Military Tribunal of the Supreme People's Court, served as the presiding judge. The judges were Yang Xianzhi and Senior Colonel Wang Xusheng of the Military Law. Li Fushan, Chief Prosecutor, represented the Supreme People's Procuratorate of our country at the Special Military Tribunal, along with Prosecutors Cao Zhenhui, Senior Colonel of the Military Law, Hu Chunyu, Senior Colonel of the Military Law, Li Fang, Guo Chunlai, Mao Zhiqi, Gao Zhengquan, Meng Wulou, Li Ying, Major of the Military Law, and Wang Zhiwu, Major of the Military Law.

The defense lawyers for the defendants were Guan Mengjue, Zhao Jingwen, Li Shiyi, Tang Hao, Guan Naifan, Deng Yi, Qi Zhongwei, Chen Fenghui, Xi Ruian, Zhang Shizheng, Li Changtai, Han Fenglu, Mao Wenming, Ni Binbin, Sun Rongzhu, Sun Pu, Lian Xisheng, Hu Jinkui, and Wang Huaran.

Representatives of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, as well as more than four hundred representatives from factories, schools, government organs, organizations, and stationed troops in Shenyang, attended the hearing.

At 8:30 a.m. on July 1st, presiding judge Jia Qian announced the opening of the court. After verifying the identities of the defendants, the presiding judge said to them: "During the court proceedings, you may question the witnesses. In addition to your lawyers defending you, you may also defend yourselves. You also have the right to speak last."

On the afternoon of the 1st, the court began investigating the criminal facts of each defendant. The state prosecutor read out the indictment of the Supreme People's Procuratorate of the People's Republic of China against the case of twenty-eight war criminals, including Takebe Rokuzo. The indictment listed the criminal facts of each defendant. These criminal facts were supported by a large number of materials as evidence, including 315 archival books and publications, 360 witness testimonies, 642 accusations from victims and relatives of victims, and the defendants' confessions. After reading the indictment, the court questioned each defendant one by one. In the face of the irrefutable facts, the defendants all pleaded guilty in court.

During the interrogation of Takebe Rokuzo, the defendant could not attend court due to illness. The Special Military Tribunal appointed Judge Yang Xianzhi to question the defendant at his residence. State Prosecutor Cao Zhenhui, Senior Colonel of the Military Law, and defense lawyers Guan Mengjue and Zhao Jingwen also went with him. The defendant answered the questions raised by the judge during the interrogation. The defendant served as the Director-General of the State Council of the puppet Manchukuo from July 1940 to August 1945. This position was nominally to assist the Premier of the puppet Manchukuo in exercising his powers, but in reality, his power in the puppet Manchukuo government surpassed everything. The Director-General presided over a "Tuesday Meeting" composed of Japanese Vice-Ministers and others from various ministries of the State Council of the puppet Manchukuo. All policies, laws, and important measures formulated by the puppet Manchukuo had to be decided first by the "Tuesday Meeting" before being formally promulgated and implemented by the puppet Manchukuo Emperor through imperial edict. Therefore, the "Tuesday Meeting" chaired by the defendant Takebe Rokuzo was actually the highest decision-making body of the puppet Manchukuo government. At the same time, the Director-General led the General Affairs Office, taking overall charge of all administrative powers of the puppet Manchukuo government and controlling the entire political, economic, and cultural affairs of the puppet Manchukuo. Takebe Rokuzo at that time actually became an important executor of Japanese imperialism's policy of aggression.

During his tenure as Director-General, the defendant planned and manipulated the puppet Manchukuo government to formulate and implement the "Law on Maintaining Public Security," the "Law on Ideological Correction," the "Law on Security Correction," and the "Special Criminal Law during the Emergency Situation" and other heinous decrees to suppress the people of Northeast China, and strengthened the puppet police and judicial organs to further suppress the people of Northeast China. As a result of the defendant's planning, decision, and leadership in implementing the above-mentioned various heinous decrees and measures, the Japanese and puppet troops, gendarmerie, police, and puppet judicial organs carried out a brutal suppression of the people of Northeast China, especially conducting multiple "security purges" in regions such as Heilongjiang, Jilin, and Rehe, frantically arresting, massacring, and imprisoning the people of Northeast China, and expelling peaceful residents in large numbers, destroying peaceful villages and towns, and creating many no-man's lands in the Rehe province area. According to the "Current Situation of Manchukuo" published in the eleventh year of the puppet Manchukuo Kangde (1944) regarding the "security purge" in Rehe, from spring to autumn of 1943 alone, 180,000 households of peaceful residents of our country were expelled in the Rehe province area, forced to concentrate in more than 3,000 concentration camp-style "group villages," and arbitrarily subjected to trampling.

During his tenure as Director-General of the puppet government, the defendant also promoted the "grain shipment" policy of plundering the grain of the people of Northeast China, the reclamation policy of forcibly occupying the people's land, the labor service policy of forcing the people to engage in slave labor, and the "National Soldier Law" of forcibly conscripting young people to serve as puppet troops, as well as the poisoning policy and cultural aggression policy. When the defendant promoted the policy of cultural aggression, he stipulated that the people of Northeast China were not allowed to say that they were Chinese and promoted Japanese as the "national language of Manchukuo" and forced its use, and even elementary school students were required to learn Japanese as the "national language."

The defendant Takebe Rokuzo's various crimes have been confirmed by a large amount of evidence. When questioned by the judges, he admitted that the crimes accused against him in the indictment were entirely factual.

The court interrogated the defendant Furuhata Tadashi. The defendant participated in manipulating the puppet Manchukuo government, and many aggressive policies and decrees were formulated under the defendant's participation in planning. He was the main assistant to the defendant Takebe Rokuzo. From October 1935 to August 1945, the defendant Furuhata Tadashi served as the Director of the Accounting Office, Vice-Minister of the Ministry of Economy, and Vice-Director of the General Affairs Office of the puppet State Council, assisting the Director-General of the puppet State Council in controlling the economic hub and participating in the "Tuesday Meeting," participating in the planning, decision-making, and promotion of the "First Five-Year Plan for Manchukuo Industrial Development" to plunder the material wealth of the people of Northeast China and support the Japanese war of aggression. At the end of 1940, he again participated in manipulating the puppet Manchukuo government and announced the "Outline of Economic Construction Cooperation between Japan, Manchukuo, and China." In 1941, he also participated in the planning and promotion of the "Second Five-Year Plan for Manchukuo Industrial Development" and the "Outline of Wartime Emergency Economic Measures," accelerating the plundering of strategic materials such as coal, iron, aluminum, and oil in the Northeast China region to support Japanese imperialism's expansion of the war of aggression. In implementing the above-mentioned heinous plans and policies, the defendant participated in the planning and promotion of decrees such as the "Industrial Control Law," plundering a large number of war-related materials. At that time, more than 110 kinds of daily metal products for civilian use, such as door knockers and iron braziers, were plundered to manufacture weapons. Historical relics such as the copper hall of the Chengde Imperial Villa were also plundered. After confessing to the crime of participating in the promotion of various economic aggression policies, the defendant Furuhata Tadashi said: "I now realize how difficult the situation was for the people of Northeast China at that time. I am a very hateful war criminal who plunged the people of Northeast China into poverty, bankruptcy, and even the abyss of death." When participating in the promotion of the poisoning policy, Furuhata Tadashi personally went to Shanghai and Nanjing to promote a large number of opium and other drugs. After confessing to this crime, he said: "I promoted the most terrible poisoning policy, which violated international law and seriously harmed the health of the Chinese people. I confess to the Chinese people."

The imprisoned puppet Manchukuo Emperor Puyi testified in court. Puyi is fifty years old this year. In court, he gave a detailed account of the crimes of the defendants Takebe Rokuzo and Furuhata Tadashi in pursuing the Japanese imperialist aggression policy, manipulating the puppet Manchukuo government, ruling and enslaving the people of Northeast China. Puyi said: "In the puppet Manchukuo, I had no real power. The real power holders who ruled and controlled the puppet Manchukuo were Takebe Rokuzo, the Director-General of the puppet Manchukuo, and his assistant Furuhata Tadashi, the Vice-Director of the General Affairs Office of the puppet Manchukuo. The formulation and implementation of all policies and decrees of the puppet Manchukuo were first decided at the Vice-Ministerial Conference (Tuesday Meeting) chaired by Takebe Rokuzo and planned with the participation of Furuhata Tadashi, attended by the Chief of the Fourth Section of the Japanese Kwantung Army, the Japanese Vice-Ministers of the puppet Ministries, etc., becoming an unshakable iron case. Then, after being passed by the State Council Meeting and the Senate Meeting of the puppet Manchukuo, the Premier of the puppet Manchukuo and the Speaker of the puppet Senate separately made formal so-called reports to me. After my formal so-called 'approval' and signature and seal, the puppet State Council announced the implementation." Puyi's testimony also said: "The Japanese Vice-Ministers in the puppet Ministries, the Japanese Provincial Vice-Governors in the puppet Provinces, and the Japanese Deputy County Magistrates in the puppet Counties were all directly commanded by Takebe Rokuzo, and the Japanese Vice-Ministers in the puppet Ministries, the Japanese Provincial Vice-Governors, and the Deputy County Magistrates all held real power. This formed Takebe Rokuzo's entire manipulation and control network over the puppet Manchukuo from the central to the local levels."

Wang Xianwei, the imprisoned Vice-Director of the General Affairs Office of the State Council of the puppet Manchukuo, and eleven ministers of various ministries, including Gu Jiheng, Minister of Transportation, Ruan Zhenduo, Minister of Foreign Affairs, Yan Chuanfu, Minister of Justice, and Yu Jingyuan, Minister of Economy, also came to court to confirm the various crimes of the defendants Takebe Rokuzo and Furuhata Tadashi in manipulating or participating in the manipulation of the puppet Manchukuo government, ruling and enslaving the people of Northeast China.

The court then interrogated the defendant Kibe Yohei. He confessed in court to the crimes he committed while serving as the Governor of the puppet Dong'an and Jiandao provinces, actively promoting the reactionary policies and decrees such as "grain shipment," poisoning, labor service, and the "National Soldier Law."

The court then interrogated the defendants Sugihara Ippaku, Mizoguchi Yoshio, Nakai Hisaji, and Yokoyama Mitsuhiko. These four defendants were all important officials of the judicial organs of the puppet Manchukuo. Among these defendants, some participated in the deliberation of the "Security Correction Law" and participated in the formulation of heinous decrees such as the "Security Correction Escort Rules"; some resolutely implemented the policies and decrees to suppress the people of Northeast China, ordering their subordinates to arrest large numbers of anti-Japanese national salvation personnel and peaceful residents; some, in the capacity of prosecutors, sent the arrested people of Northeast China to the puppet court for prosecution; some personally served as the presiding judge of the puppet court, sentencing a large number of peaceful residents of our country to imprisonment or death; some also established "Correction and Guidance Institutes," imprisoning large numbers of people of Northeast China. During the tenure of the defendant Nakai Hisaji as the Director of the Judicial Correction Bureau of the puppet Ministry of Justice, he successively established fourteen "Correction and Guidance Institutes" in places such as Harbin, Shenyang, Benxi, Anshan, Fushun, Hegang, and Qiqihar. The "Correction and Guidance Institute" in Hegang often imprisoned more than 1,000 peaceful residents of our country.

The court then interrogated the defendants Saito Yoshio, Utsugi Takeo, Shimura Yukio, Nishinaga Shoji, Yoshifusa Torao, Fujiwara Hironoshin, Kimura Mitsuaki, Horiguchi Masao, Kamitsubo Tetsuichi, and Kobayashi Kiichi. They were all senior or middle-ranking commanders in the gendarmerie of the puppet Manchukuo. The court investigation confirmed that each defendant had committed the crimes of actively participating in planning to destroy the Northeast local organizations of the Chinese Communist Party and other anti-Japanese national salvation organizations, as well as ordering their subordinates to arrest, severely torture, and massacre the anti-Japanese national salvation personnel and peaceful residents of our country on a large scale. Some even inhumanly sent the arrested peaceful residents to the Japanese army's germ warfare unit to carry out germ effectiveness experiments and kill them. The defendant Saito Yoshio was a senior commander in the gendarmerie of the puppet Manchukuo. From April to October 1937, under the planning and leadership of the Central Police Control Committee of the puppet government, in which the defendant participated, the Japanese and puppet gendarmerie, police, and secret agents successively destroyed the local organizations of the CPC Harbin Special Committee, Harbin Municipal Committee, and Fengtian Municipal Committee, arresting 482 members of the Chinese Communist Party and local residents. After torture, 341 people were sent to the puppet judicial organs, of which 85 were executed. During the tenure of the defendant Horiguchi Masao as the Captain of the Japanese Gendarmerie in Jining, he commanded the gendarmerie under his command to arrest the anti-Japanese national salvation personnel and peaceful residents of our country, sending nine of them, including Wang Qinshan and Tang Yongjin, to the Japanese Army's Unit 731 in Harbin to conduct germ effectiveness experiments and kill them.

The court finally interrogated the defendants Miyake Hideya, Sako Ryusuke, Hara Hiroshi, Imayoshi Hitoshi, Taii Kujiro, Shimamura Saburo, Kage Shigehiro, Tsukidani Akizo, Kashiwaba Yuichi, Hachisuka Shigeo, and Nozaki Shigeyuki. They all held important positions in the police organs and railway guard army of the puppet Manchukuo at various levels, and were participants, planners, or executors of the Japanese imperialists' implementation of police rule and secret agent terror against the people of Northeast China. They had personally or ordered and commanded their subordinates to massacre, arrest, torture, abuse, or expel the people of Northeast China, and brutally suppressed the national liberation movement of our country. They also assisted the puppet Manchukuo government in promoting various aggressive policies such as economic, labor, and cultural policies. During the tenure of the defendant Taii Kujiro as the Director of the Xingshan Police Station in Helit County, Sanjiang Province of the puppet Manchukuo, he participated in planning and leading the unit under his command to secretly dispatch secret agents to plot and assassinate General Zhao Shangzhi, the commander-in-chief of the Third Route Army of the Northeast Anti-Japanese Allied Army of our country. The defendant was one of the main criminals in this incident.

The court investigation ended on the 11th. The debate began on the 12th. The state prosecutor first expressed his opinion. Li Fushan, the chief prosecutor, pointed out that the court investigation fully confirmed that the defendants, Takebe Rokuzo and the other twenty-eight in this case, were all war criminals with serious crimes. In order to uphold justice, safeguard our country's sacred and inviolable sovereignty and world peace, he requested the court to give the defendants the punishment they deserved.

Next, the lawyers defended the defendants. Lawyers Guan Mengjue and Zhao Jingwen defended the defendant Takebe Rokuzo. The other seventeen lawyers also defended the twenty-seven defendants respectively. The defense lawyers requested the court to impose lenient sentences based on the defendants' expressions of repentance.

The debate ended on the morning of the 13th. The defendants made their final statements on the afternoon of the 13th.

When making his statement, the defendant Furuhata Tadashi said: "I deeply realize that I am a war criminal who openly violated international law and humanitarian principles and committed serious crimes against the Chinese people. I sincerely apologize to the Chinese people. For the past six years, the Chinese people have consistently treated me with humanitarianism and given me the opportunity to calmly recognize my crimes. Because of this, I have regained my conscience and reason. I know the path that a true person should take. I think this is what the Chinese people gave me. I don't know how to thank the Chinese people."

The defendant Saito Yoshio said: "Because Japanese imperialism launched a war of aggression, the Chinese people suffered incalculable losses, and the Japanese people suffered devastation and unprecedented disasters. I actively participated in the Japanese imperialist war of aggression. Looking back on the past, I feel extremely ashamed and remorseful. I now realize the seriousness of the crimes. No matter what severe sentence the court imposes on me, I am willing to accept it."

The defendant Sako Ryusuke said: "Only after I realized my crimes did I take the first step of humanity. In the future, I will better awaken my conscience and start a new life."

The defendant Kage Shigehiro said: "Based on my own experience, the war of aggression brings pain and disaster to mankind that cannot be described in words. The war of aggression also caused me to commit extremely barbaric crimes. I hate my past and hate the war of aggression. I want to oppose the war of aggression and fight for lasting peace. I think that doing so is the path that a person who has awakened his conscience should take. I request the court to severely punish me. This is right and just. I think this is also a warning to the imperialist elements who are plotting to launch a war of aggression."

After deliberation, the court opened on the morning of the 20th at 8 a.m. to announce the verdict. The Special Military Tribunal sentenced Takebe Rokuzo to 20 years in prison, Furuhata Tadashi to 18 years in prison, Saito Yoshio to 20 years in prison, Nakai Hisaji to 18 years in prison, Miyake Hideya to 18 years in prison, Yokoyama Mitsuhiko to 16 years in prison, Sugihara Ippaku to 18 years in prison, Sako Ryusuke to 18 years in prison, Hara Hiroshi to 16 years in prison, Kibe Yohei to 15 years in prison, Imayoshi Hitoshi to 16 years in prison, Utsugi Takeo to 13 years in prison, Taii Kujiro to 16 years in prison, Kimura Mitsuaki to 16 years in prison, Shimamura Saburo to 15 years in prison, Kage Shigehiro to 15 years in prison, Tsukidani Akizo to 15 years in prison, Yoshifusa Torao to 14 years in prison, Kashiwaba Yuichi to 15 years in prison, Fujiwara Hironoshin to 14 years in prison, Kamitsubo Tetsuichi to 12 years in prison, Hachisuka Shigeo to 12 years in prison, Horiguchi Masao to 12 years in prison, Nozaki Shigeyuki to 14 years in prison, Mizoguchi Yoshio to 15 years in prison, Shimura Yukio to 12 years in prison, Kobayashi Kiichi to 12 years in prison, and Nishinaga Shoji to 12 years in prison. The court ruled that the term of imprisonment for each defendant shall be calculated from the date of the verdict, and the number of days of detention before the verdict shall be offset against the term of imprisonment at the rate of one day for one day.

    这二十八名日本战争犯罪分子在日本帝国主义侵略我国的战争期间，在伪满洲国行政、司法、警察等机关和宪兵队中担任各种不同的军政职务。庭审证实，这二十八名战争犯罪分子以不同的身份，分别犯了积极执行日本帝国主义侵略我国的政策，支持日本帝国主义对我国的侵略战争，操纵或者参与操纵伪满洲国傀儡政府，僭夺我国国家的主权，违反国际法准则和人道原则等各种严重罪行。法庭最后分别判处了他们十二年到二十年的有期徒刑。
    最高人民法院特别军事法庭庭长贾潜担任审判长，审判员是杨显之和军法上校王许生。我国最高人民检察院出席特别军事法庭的是首席检察员李甫山，检察员军法上校曹振辉、军法上校胡春雨、李放、郭春来、毛志奇、高正权、孟武楼、军法少校李瑛、军法少校王志武。
    被告人的辩护律师是关梦觉、赵敬文、李式一、唐豪、关乃藩、邓毅、祁仲伟、陈芬辉、习瑞安、张世铮、李长太、韩凤路、毛文明、倪彬彬、孙蓉珠、孙仆、廉希圣、胡金魁、王化然。
    到庭旁听的有中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会的代表，以及沈阳市工厂、学校、机关、团体和驻军的代表四百多人。
    七月一日上午八时三十分，审判长贾潜宣布开庭。审判长在查明了各被告人的身份以后对被告人说：“你们在庭审过程中可以向证人发问，除辩护人为你们辩护外，你们还可以自己辩护，你们还有最后说话的权利。”
    一日下午，法庭开始对各被告人的犯罪事实进行调查。国家公诉人宣读了中华人民共和国最高人民检察院对武部六藏等二十八名战争犯罪案的起诉书，起诉书上列举了各被告人的犯罪事实。这些犯罪事实以档案书刊315件、证人证词三百六十件、被害人和被害人亲属的控诉书642件以及被告人的供词等大量材料作为证据。读完起诉书以后，法庭即逐一审问了各被告人。被告人在铁证如山的事实面前，都当庭低头认罪。
    在审讯武部六藏时，被告人因病不能到庭，特别军事法庭委派审判员杨显之前往被告住地进行讯问。同时前往的还有国家公诉人军法上校曹振辉，被告辩护律师关梦觉、赵敬文。被告人回答了审判员在讯问时所提出的问题。被告人在1940年7月到1945年8月任伪满洲国国务院总务长官，这个职务名义上是辅佐伪满洲国国务总理行使职权，实际上他的权力在伪满洲国政府中超越一切。总务长官主持了一个由伪满洲国国务院各部日本人次长等人组成的“火曜会”，凡伪满洲国制定的政策、法令和采取的重要措施，都必须先由“火曜会”决定，然后再在形式上经由伪满洲国皇帝以敕令公布施行。因此，由被告人武部六藏主持的“火曜会”，实际上是伪满洲国政府的最高决策机构。同时，总务长官领导总务厅，总揽伪满洲国傀儡政府的一切行政权力，支配伪满洲国的整个政治、经济和文化事务。武部六藏当时实际上成为日本帝国主义侵略政策的重要执行者。
    被告人任总务长官期间，策划并操纵伪满洲国傀儡政府制定和实行镇压我国东北人民的“治安维持法”、“思想矫正法”、“保安矫正法”和“时局特别刑法”等罪恶法令，并且加强伪警察、司法机关，进一步镇压我国东北人民。由于被告人策划、决定并且领导推行上述各种罪恶法令和措施的结果，日伪军队、宪兵、警察和伪司法机关对我国东北人民进行了残酷的镇压，特别是在黑龙江、吉林和热河等地区进行了多次“治安肃正”，疯狂地抓捕、屠杀和囚禁我国东北人民，并且在我国热河省地区大量驱逐和平居民，毁灭和平村镇，制造了许多无人区。根据伪满康德十一年（1944年）版“满洲国现势”一书中关于热河“治安肃正”的记载，仅1943年春季到秋季，即在热河省地区驱逐我国和平居民十八万户，强迫集中在三千多个集中营式的“集团部落”内，并且对这些无辜居民任意加以蹂躏。
    被告人任伪总务长官期间，还推行了掠夺我国东北人民粮食的“粮谷出荷”政策、强占人民土地的开拓政策、强迫人民从事奴役性劳动的劳务政策和强征青年充当伪军的“国兵法”以及毒化政策和文化侵略政策。被告人推行文化侵略政策时，规定不准我国东北人民说自己是中国人，还推行日语为“满洲国国语”强迫习用，并且要小学生也学习日语作为“国语”。
    被告人武部六藏的各项罪行，为大量的证据材料所证实。在审判员讯问时，他承认了起诉书上对他控诉的罪行完全是事实。
    法庭审问了被告人古海忠之。被告人参与操纵伪满洲国傀儡政府，许多侵略政策和法令都是在被告人参与策划之下制定的。他是被告人武部六藏的主要辅佐者。1935年10月到1945年8月，被告人古海忠之任伪国务院主计处处长、经济部次长、总务厅次长期间，协助伪国务院总务长官掌握经济中枢，并且参加“火曜会”，参与策划决定和推行掠夺我国东北人民物质财富、支援日本侵略战争的“第一次满洲产业开发五年计划”。1940年末，又参与操纵伪满洲国傀儡政府，公布了“日满华经济建设连系要纲”。1941年又参与策划和推行“第二次满洲产业开发五年计划”和“战时紧急经济方策要纲”，加紧掠夺我国东北地区的煤、铁、铝、石油等战略物资，支持日本帝国主义扩大侵略战争。在执行上述罪恶的计划和政策时，被告人参与策划和推行了“产业统制法”等法令，大量掠夺与战争有关的物资，当时民用的门环、铁火盆等一百一十多种日用金属制品，都被掠夺去制造武器。我国承德离宫的铜殿等历史文物也被掠去。被告人古海忠之在供认了参与推行各种经济侵略政策的罪行以后说：“我现在认识到中国东北人民在当时是处在如何困难的境地，我是把中国东北人民陷入贫穷、破产甚至死亡深渊的一个极可恶的战争犯罪分子。”古海忠之在参与推行毒化政策时，曾亲自到上海、南京大量推销鸦片等毒品。他在供认了这一罪行以后说：“我推行了最可怕的毒化政策，这是违反国际法的，并且严重损害了中国人民的健康，我向中国人民认罪。”
    在押的伪满洲国皇帝溥仪到庭作证。溥仪今年五十岁。在法庭上他详细地供述了被告人武部六藏和古海忠之奉行日本帝国主义侵略政策，操纵伪满洲国政府，统治和奴役我国东北人民的罪行。溥仪说：“在伪满，我是没实权的。统治和支配伪满的实权者，就是伪满总务长官武部六藏和他的辅佐者伪满总务厅次长古海忠之。伪满的一切政策法令的制定和实施，都是首先由武部六藏主持和古海忠之参与策划召开的日本关东军第四课长、伪各部日本人次长等出席参加的次长会议（火曜会）上作出决定，成为不可动摇的铁案。然后经过伪满国务会议和伪参议府会议通过，并由伪满总理和伪参议府议长先后分别向我作形式上的所谓报告，经过我形式上的所谓‘裁可’和签名盖章后，伪国务院便发表实施。”溥仪的证词中还说：“在伪满各部的日本人次长，伪各省的日本人省次长，各县的日本人副县长都是由武部六藏直接指挥，而伪各部的日本人次长、省次长、副县长都是掌握实权的。这就形成了武部六藏对伪满的由中央到地方的整个操纵支配网。”
    在押的伪满洲国国务院总务厅次长王贤湋和伪交通部大臣谷次亨，伪外交部大臣阮振铎，伪司法部大臣阎传绂，伪经济部大臣于静远等各部大臣十一人也到庭证实了被告人武部六藏和古海忠之操纵或参与操纵伪满洲国傀儡政府，统治和奴役我东北人民的各种罪行。
    法庭接着审问了被告人歧部与平。他在法庭上供认了他在担任伪东安，间岛等省长时，积极推行“粮谷出荷”，毒化、劳务和“国兵法”等反动的政策法令所犯的罪行。
    法庭接着审问了被告人杉原一策、沟口嘉夫、中井久二，横山光彦。这四名被告人都是伪满洲国司法机关的重要官员。这些被告人中，有的参与审议“保安矫正法”和参与拟制“保安矫正护送规则”等罪恶法令；有的坚决执行了镇压我国东北人民的政策法令，命令所属大批抓捕我国抗日救国人员和和平居民；有的以检察官的身份，把抓捕的我国东北人民送到伪法院起诉；有的亲任伪法院审判长，将我国大批和平居民判处徒刑或刑死；有的还建立“矫正辅导院”，大批囚禁我国东北人民，被告人中井久二任伪司法矫正总局长期间，先后在哈尔滨、沈阳、本溪、鞍山、抚顺、鹤岗、齐齐哈尔等地建立了十四处“矫正辅导院”。鹤岗的“矫正辅导院”经常囚禁我国和平居民一千多人。
    法庭接着审问了被告人齐藤美夫、宇津木孟雄、志村行雄、西永彰治、吉房虎雄、藤原广之进、木村光明、堀口正雄、上坪铁一、小林喜一。他们都是伪满洲国宪兵中的高级或中级的指挥官。庭审调查证实了各被告人都犯有积极参与策划破坏中国共产党东北地方组织和其他抗日救国组织的罪行，以及命令所属抓捕、严刑拷打、大肆屠杀我国抗日救国人员和和平居民的罪行。有的还毫无人性地把抓捕的和平居民送到日军细菌部队作细菌效能试验而加以杀害。被告人齐藤美夫是伪满洲国宪兵中的高级指挥官。1937年4月到10月，在被告人参加的伪中央警务统制委员会的策划和领导下，日伪宪兵、警察和特务先后破坏了中共哈尔滨特委、哈尔滨市委、奉天市委等地方组织，抓捕中国共产党党员和当地居民482人，经刑讯后将341人送交伪司法机关，其中有八十五人被处死。被告人堀口正雄任鸡宁日本宪兵队长期间，指挥所属宪兵抓捕了我国抗日救国人员和和平居民，将其中王勤山、唐永金等九人送到哈尔滨日军第七三一细菌部队作细菌效能实验加以杀害。
    法庭最后审问了被告人三宅秀也、佐古龙祐原弘志、今吉均、田井久二郎、岛村三郎、鹿毛繁太、筑谷章造、柏叶勇一、峰须贺重雄、野崎茂作。他们都担任过伪满洲国各级警察机关和铁路警护军的重要职务，是日本帝国主义对我国东北人民实行警察统治和特务恐怖的参与策划者或执行者。他们曾亲自或命令、指挥所属部下屠杀、抓捕、刑讯、虐待或者驱逐我国东北人民，残酷地镇压我国民族解放运动。他们还协助伪满洲国政府推行经济、劳务、文化等各种侵略政策。被告人田井久二郎任伪三江省鹤立县兴山警察署署长期间，参与策划并且领导所属单位秘密派遣特务阴谋暗害了我国东北抗日联军第三路军总指挥赵尚志将军。被告人是这一事件的主要罪犯之一。
    庭审调查在十一日结束。十二日开始辩论。国家公诉人首先发表意见。国家公诉人首席检察员李甫山指出，经庭审调查，完全证实了本案被告人武部六藏等二十八名均属罪恶重大的战争犯罪分子。为了伸张正义，维护我国神圣不可侵犯的主权和世界和平，请求法庭给被告人以应得的惩罚。
    接着，律师们为被告人作辩护。律师关梦觉和赵敬文为被告人武部六藏作了辩护。其余十七位律师也分别为二十七名被告人作了辩护。辩护人根据被告人的悔罪表现，请求法庭从宽判处。
    十三日上午辩论结束。十三日下午被告人最后申述意见。
    被告人古海忠之在陈述意见时说：“我深深地认识到我是一个公然违反国际法和人道原则、对中国人民犯下了重大罪行的战争犯罪分子，我真心地向中国人民谢罪。对于我这样一个令人难以容忍的犯罪分子，六年来，中国人民始终给我以人道主义待遇，同时给了我冷静地认识自己罪行的机会。由于这些，我才恢复了良心和理性。我知道了真正的人应该走的道路。我认为这是中国人民给我的，我不知道怎样来感激中国人民。”
    被告人齐藤美夫说：“由于日本帝国主义发动了侵略战争，使中国人民遭到了难以计算的损失，使日本人民遭到了蹂躏和史无前例的灾难。我积极地参加了日本帝国主义的侵略战争。回忆过去，我感到万分惭愧和忏悔。我现在认识到罪行的严重性，无论法庭对我判处什么样的重刑，我都愿意接受。”
    被告人佐古龙祐说：“自我认识了自己的罪行以后，我才算是走上了人类的第一步。今后，我要更好地唤醒我的良心，重新作人。”
    被告人鹿毛繁太说：“以我自身的体验，侵略战争给人类以不能用言语形容的痛苦和灾难。侵略战争也使我犯下了极为野蛮的罪行。我憎恨自己的过去，也憎恨侵略战争。我要反对侵略战争，为持久和平而斗争，我认为这样做，才是一个已经唤醒了良心的人应该走的道路。我请求法庭对我加以严惩，这是应该的，正义的。我想这对正在阴谋发动侵略战争的帝国主义分子也是一个警告。”
    法庭经过评议以后，在二十日上午八时开庭宣判。特别军事法庭判处武部六藏徒刑二十年、古海忠之徒刑十八年、齐藤美夫徒刑二十年、中井久二徒刑十八年、三宅秀也徒刑十八年、横山光彦徒刑十六年、杉原一策徒刑十八年、佐古龙祐徒刑十八年、原弘志徒刑十六年、歧部与平徒刑十五年、今吉均徒刑十六年、宇津木孟雄徒刑十三年、田井久二郎徒刑十六年、木村光明徒刑十六年、岛村三郎徒刑十五年、鹿毛繁太徒刑十五年、筑谷章造徒刑十五年、吉房虎雄徒刑十四年、柏叶勇一徒刑十五年、藤原广之进徒刑十四年、上坪铁一徒刑十二年、蜂须贺重雄徒刑十二年、堀口正雄徒刑十二年、野崎茂作徒刑十四年、沟口嘉夫徒刑十五年、志村行雄徒刑十二年、小林喜一徒刑十二年、西永彰治徒刑十二年。法庭判决，各被告人的刑期，自判决之日起算，判决前关押的日数，以一日抵徒刑一日。（附图片）
