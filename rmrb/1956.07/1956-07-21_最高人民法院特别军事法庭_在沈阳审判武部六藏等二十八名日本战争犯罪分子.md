During the war of Japanese imperialism's invasion of our country, these twenty-eight Japanese war criminals held various military and political positions in the administrative, judicial, and police organs and the gendarmerie of the puppet Manchukuo. The court trial confirmed that these twenty-eight war criminals, in different capacities, committed various serious crimes, including actively implementing the policies of Japanese imperialism to invade our country, supporting Japanese imperialism's war of aggression against our country, manipulating or participating in the manipulation of the puppet Manchukuo government, usurping our country's sovereignty, and violating the norms of international law and humanitarian principles. The court finally sentenced them to fixed-term imprisonment ranging from twelve to twenty years.

Jia Qian, President of the Special Military Tribunal of the Supreme People's Court, served as the presiding judge. The judges were Yang Xianzhi and Senior Colonel Wang Xusheng of the Military Law. Li Fushan, Chief Prosecutor, represented the Supreme People's Procuratorate of our country at the Special Military Tribunal, along with Prosecutors Cao Zhenhui, Senior Colonel of the Military Law, Hu Chunyu, Senior Colonel of the Military Law, Li Fang, Guo Chunlai, Mao Zhiqi, Gao Zhengquan, Meng Wulou, Li Ying, Major of the Military Law, and Wang Zhiwu, Major of the Military Law.

The defense lawyers for the defendants were Guan Mengjue, Zhao Jingwen, Li Shiyi, Tang Hao, Guan Naifan, Deng Yi, Qi Zhongwei, Chen Fenghui, Xi Ruian, Zhang Shizheng, Li Changtai, Han Fenglu, Mao Wenming, Ni Binbin, Sun Rongzhu, Sun Pu, Lian Xisheng, Hu Jinkui, and Wang Huaran.

Representatives of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, as well as more than four hundred representatives from factories, schools, government organs, organizations, and stationed troops in Shenyang, attended the hearing.

At 8:30 a.m. on July 1st, presiding judge Jia Qian announced the opening of the court. After verifying the identities of the defendants, the presiding judge said to them: "During the court proceedings, you may question the witnesses. In addition to your lawyers defending you, you may also defend yourselves. You also have the right to speak last."

On the afternoon of the 1st, the court began investigating the criminal facts of each defendant. The state prosecutor read out the indictment of the Supreme People's Procuratorate of the People's Republic of China against the case of twenty-eight war criminals, including Takebe Rokuzo. The indictment listed the criminal facts of each defendant. These criminal facts were supported by a large number of materials as evidence, including 315 archival books and publications, 360 witness testimonies, 642 accusations from victims and relatives of victims, and the defendants' confessions. After reading the indictment, the court questioned each defendant one by one. In the face of the irrefutable facts, the defendants all pleaded guilty in court.

During the interrogation of Takebe Rokuzo, the defendant could not attend court due to illness. The Special Military Tribunal appointed Judge Yang Xianzhi to question the defendant at his residence. State Prosecutor Cao Zhenhui, Senior Colonel of the Military Law, and defense lawyers Guan Mengjue and Zhao Jingwen also went with him. The defendant answered the questions raised by the judge during the interrogation. The defendant served as the Director-General of the State Council of the puppet Manchukuo from July 1940 to August 1945. This position was nominally to assist the Premier of the puppet Manchukuo in exercising his powers, but in reality, his power in the puppet Manchukuo government surpassed everything. The Director-General presided over a "Tuesday Meeting" composed of Japanese Vice-Ministers and others from various ministries of the State Council of the puppet Manchukuo. All policies, laws, and important measures formulated by the puppet Manchukuo had to be decided first by the "Tuesday Meeting" before being formally promulgated and implemented by the puppet Manchukuo Emperor through imperial edict. Therefore, the "Tuesday Meeting" chaired by the defendant Takebe Rokuzo was actually the highest decision-making body of the puppet Manchukuo government. At the same time, the Director-General led the General Affairs Office, taking overall charge of all administrative powers of the puppet Manchukuo government and controlling the entire political, economic, and cultural affairs of the puppet Manchukuo. Takebe Rokuzo at that time actually became an important executor of Japanese imperialism's policy of aggression.

During his tenure as Director-General, the defendant planned and manipulated the puppet Manchukuo government to formulate and implement the "Law on Maintaining Public Security," the "Law on Ideological Correction," the "Law on Security Correction," and the "Special Criminal Law during the Emergency Situation" and other heinous decrees to suppress the people of Northeast China, and strengthened the puppet police and judicial organs to further suppress the people of Northeast China. As a result of the defendant's planning, decision, and leadership in implementing the above-mentioned various heinous decrees and measures, the Japanese and puppet troops, gendarmerie, police, and puppet judicial organs carried out a brutal suppression of the people of Northeast China, especially conducting multiple "security purges" in regions such as Heilongjiang, Jilin, and Rehe, frantically arresting, massacring, and imprisoning the people of Northeast China, and expelling peaceful residents in large numbers, destroying peaceful villages and towns, and creating many no-man's lands in the Rehe province area. According to the "Current Situation of Manchukuo" published in the eleventh year of the puppet Manchukuo Kangde (1944) regarding the "security purge" in Rehe, from spring to autumn of 1943 alone, 180,000 households of peaceful residents of our country were expelled in the Rehe province area, forced to concentrate in more than 3,000 concentration camp-style "group villages," and arbitrarily subjected to trampling.

During his tenure as Director-General of the puppet government, the defendant also promoted the "grain shipment" policy of plundering the grain of the people of Northeast China, the reclamation policy of forcibly occupying the people's land, the labor service policy of forcing the people to engage in slave labor, and the "National Soldier Law" of forcibly conscripting young people to serve as puppet troops, as well as the poisoning policy and cultural aggression policy. When the defendant promoted the policy of cultural aggression, he stipulated that the people of Northeast China were not allowed to say that they were Chinese and promoted Japanese as the "national language of Manchukuo" and forced its use, and even elementary school students were required to learn Japanese as the "national language."

The defendant Takebe Rokuzo's various crimes have been confirmed by a large amount of evidence. When questioned by the judges, he admitted that the crimes accused against him in the indictment were entirely factual.

The court interrogated the defendant Furuhata Tadashi. The defendant participated in manipulating the puppet Manchukuo government, and many aggressive policies and decrees were formulated under the defendant's participation in planning. He was the main assistant to the defendant Takebe Rokuzo. From October 1935 to August 1945, the defendant Furuhata Tadashi served as the Director of the Accounting Office, Vice-Minister of the Ministry of Economy, and Vice-Director of the General Affairs Office of the puppet State Council, assisting the Director-General of the puppet State Council in controlling the economic hub and participating in the "Tuesday Meeting," participating in the planning, decision-making, and promotion of the "First Five-Year Plan for Manchukuo Industrial Development" to plunder the material wealth of the people of Northeast China and support the Japanese war of aggression. At the end of 1940, he again participated in manipulating the puppet Manchukuo government and announced the "Outline of Economic Construction Cooperation between Japan, Manchukuo, and China." In 1941, he also participated in the planning and promotion of the "Second Five-Year Plan for Manchukuo Industrial Development" and the "Outline of Wartime Emergency Economic Measures," accelerating the plundering of strategic materials such as coal, iron, aluminum, and oil in the Northeast China region to support Japanese imperialism's expansion of the war of aggression. In implementing the above-mentioned heinous plans and policies, the defendant participated in the planning and promotion of decrees such as the "Industrial Control Law," plundering a large number of war-related materials. At that time, more than 110 kinds of daily metal products for civilian use, such as door knockers and iron braziers, were plundered to manufacture weapons. Historical relics such as the copper hall of the Chengde Imperial Villa were also plundered. After confessing to the crime of participating in the promotion of various economic aggression policies, the defendant Furuhata Tadashi said: "I now realize how difficult the situation was for the people of Northeast China at that time. I am a very hateful war criminal who plunged the people of Northeast China into poverty, bankruptcy, and even the abyss of death." When participating in the promotion of the poisoning policy, Furuhata Tadashi personally went to Shanghai and Nanjing to promote a large number of opium and other drugs. After confessing to this crime, he said: "I promoted the most terrible poisoning policy, which violated international law and seriously harmed the health of the Chinese people. I confess to the Chinese people."

The imprisoned puppet Manchukuo Emperor Puyi testified in court. Puyi is fifty years old this year. In court, he gave a detailed account of the crimes of the defendants Takebe Rokuzo and Furuhata Tadashi in pursuing the Japanese imperialist aggression policy, manipulating the puppet Manchukuo government, ruling and enslaving the people of Northeast China. Puyi said: "In the puppet Manchukuo, I had no real power. The real power holders who ruled and controlled the puppet Manchukuo were Takebe Rokuzo, the Director-General of the puppet Manchukuo, and his assistant Furuhata Tadashi, the Vice-Director of the General Affairs Office of the puppet Manchukuo. The formulation and implementation of all policies and decrees of the puppet Manchukuo were first decided at the Vice-Ministerial Conference (Tuesday Meeting) chaired by Takebe Rokuzo and planned with the participation of Furuhata Tadashi, attended by the Chief of the Fourth Section of the Japanese Kwantung Army, the Japanese Vice-Ministers of the puppet Ministries, etc., becoming an unshakable iron case. Then, after being passed by the State Council Meeting and the Senate Meeting of the puppet Manchukuo, the Premier of the puppet Manchukuo and the Speaker of the puppet Senate separately made formal so-called reports to me. After my formal so-called 'approval' and signature and seal, the puppet State Council announced the implementation." Puyi's testimony also said: "The Japanese Vice-Ministers in the puppet Ministries, the Japanese Provincial Vice-Governors in the puppet Provinces, and the Japanese Deputy County Magistrates in the puppet Counties were all directly commanded by Takebe Rokuzo, and the Japanese Vice-Ministers in the puppet Ministries, the Japanese Provincial Vice-Governors, and the Deputy County Magistrates all held real power. This formed Takebe Rokuzo's entire manipulation and control network over the puppet Manchukuo from the central to the local levels."

Wang Xianwei, the imprisoned Vice-Director of the General Affairs Office of the State Council of the puppet Manchukuo, and eleven ministers of various ministries, including Gu Jiheng, Minister of Transportation, Ruan Zhenduo, Minister of Foreign Affairs, Yan Chuanfu, Minister of Justice, and Yu Jingyuan, Minister of Economy, also came to court to confirm the various crimes of the defendants Takebe Rokuzo and Furuhata Tadashi in manipulating or participating in the manipulation of the puppet Manchukuo government, ruling and enslaving the people of Northeast China.

The court then interrogated the defendant Kibe Yohei. He confessed in court to the crimes he committed while serving as the Governor of the puppet Dong'an and Jiandao provinces, actively promoting the reactionary policies and decrees such as "grain shipment," poisoning, labor service, and the "National Soldier Law."

The court then interrogated the defendants Sugihara Ippaku, Mizoguchi Yoshio, Nakai Hisaji, and Yokoyama Mitsuhiko. These four defendants were all important officials of the judicial organs of the puppet Manchukuo. Among these defendants, some participated in the deliberation of the "Security Correction Law" and participated in the formulation of heinous decrees such as the "Security Correction Escort Rules"; some resolutely implemented the policies and decrees to suppress the people of Northeast China, ordering their subordinates to arrest large numbers of anti-Japanese national salvation personnel and peaceful residents; some, in the capacity of prosecutors, sent the arrested people of Northeast China to the puppet court for prosecution; some personally served as the presiding judge of the puppet court, sentencing a large number of peaceful residents of our country to imprisonment or death; some also established "Correction and Guidance Institutes," imprisoning large numbers of people of Northeast China. During the tenure of the defendant Nakai Hisaji as the Director of the Judicial Correction Bureau of the puppet Ministry of Justice, he successively established fourteen "Correction and Guidance Institutes" in places such as Harbin, Shenyang, Benxi, Anshan, Fushun, Hegang, and Qiqihar. The "Correction and Guidance Institute" in Hegang often imprisoned more than 1,000 peaceful residents of our country.

The court then interrogated the defendants Saito Yoshio, Utsugi Takeo, Shimura Yukio, Nishinaga Shoji, Yoshifusa Torao, Fujiwara Hironoshin, Kimura Mitsuaki, Horiguchi Masao, Kamitsubo Tetsuichi, and Kobayashi Kiichi. They were all senior or middle-ranking commanders in the gendarmerie of the puppet Manchukuo. The court investigation confirmed that each defendant had committed the crimes of actively participating in planning to destroy the Northeast local organizations of the Chinese Communist Party and other anti-Japanese national salvation organizations, as well as ordering their subordinates to arrest, severely torture, and massacre the anti-Japanese national salvation personnel and peaceful residents of our country on a large scale. Some even inhumanly sent the arrested peaceful residents to the Japanese army's germ warfare unit to carry out germ effectiveness experiments and kill them. The defendant Saito Yoshio was a senior commander in the gendarmerie of the puppet Manchukuo. From April to October 1937, under the planning and leadership of the Central Police Control Committee of the puppet government, in which the defendant participated, the Japanese and puppet gendarmerie, police, and secret agents successively destroyed the local organizations of the CPC Harbin Special Committee, Harbin Municipal Committee, and Fengtian Municipal Committee, arresting 482 members of the Chinese Communist Party and local residents. After torture, 341 people were sent to the puppet judicial organs, of which 85 were executed. During the tenure of the defendant Horiguchi Masao as the Captain of the Japanese Gendarmerie in Jining, he commanded the gendarmerie under his command to arrest the anti-Japanese national salvation personnel and peaceful residents of our country, sending nine of them, including Wang Qinshan and Tang Yongjin, to the Japanese Army's Unit 731 in Harbin to conduct germ effectiveness experiments and kill them.

The court finally interrogated the defendants Miyake Hideya, Sako Ryusuke, Hara Hiroshi, Imayoshi Hitoshi, Taii Kujiro, Shimamura Saburo, Kage Shigehiro, Tsukidani Akizo, Kashiwaba Yuichi, Hachisuka Shigeo, and Nozaki Shigeyuki. They all held important positions in the police organs and railway guard army of the puppet Manchukuo at various levels, and were participants, planners, or executors of the Japanese imperialists' implementation of police rule and secret agent terror against the people of Northeast China. They had personally or ordered and commanded their subordinates to massacre, arrest, torture, abuse, or expel the people of Northeast China, and brutally suppressed the national liberation movement of our country. They also assisted the puppet Manchukuo government in promoting various aggressive policies such as economic, labor, and cultural policies. During the tenure of the defendant Taii Kujiro as the Director of the Xingshan Police Station in Helit County, Sanjiang Province of the puppet Manchukuo, he participated in planning and leading the unit under his command to secretly dispatch secret agents to plot and assassinate General Zhao Shangzhi, the commander-in-chief of the Third Route Army of the Northeast Anti-Japanese Allied Army of our country. The defendant was one of the main criminals in this incident.

The court investigation ended on the 11th. The debate began on the 12th. The state prosecutor first expressed his opinion. Li Fushan, the chief prosecutor, pointed out that the court investigation fully confirmed that the defendants, Takebe Rokuzo and the other twenty-eight in this case, were all war criminals with serious crimes. In order to uphold justice, safeguard our country's sacred and inviolable sovereignty and world peace, he requested the court to give the defendants the punishment they deserved.

Next, the lawyers defended the defendants. Lawyers Guan Mengjue and Zhao Jingwen defended the defendant Takebe Rokuzo. The other seventeen lawyers also defended the twenty-seven defendants respectively. The defense lawyers requested the court to impose lenient sentences based on the defendants' expressions of repentance.

The debate ended on the morning of the 13th. The defendants made their final statements on the afternoon of the 13th.

When making his statement, the defendant Furuhata Tadashi said: "I deeply realize that I am a war criminal who openly violated international law and humanitarian principles and committed serious crimes against the Chinese people. I sincerely apologize to the Chinese people. For the past six years, the Chinese people have consistently treated me with humanitarianism and given me the opportunity to calmly recognize my crimes. Because of this, I have regained my conscience and reason. I know the path that a true person should take. I think this is what the Chinese people gave me. I don't know how to thank the Chinese people."

The defendant Saito Yoshio said: "Because Japanese imperialism launched a war of aggression, the Chinese people suffered incalculable losses, and the Japanese people suffered devastation and unprecedented disasters. I actively participated in the Japanese imperialist war of aggression. Looking back on the past, I feel extremely ashamed and remorseful. I now realize the seriousness of the crimes. No matter what severe sentence the court imposes on me, I am willing to accept it."

The defendant Sako Ryusuke said: "Only after I realized my crimes did I take the first step of humanity. In the future, I will better awaken my conscience and start a new life."

The defendant Kage Shigehiro said: "Based on my own experience, the war of aggression brings pain and disaster to mankind that cannot be described in words. The war of aggression also caused me to commit extremely barbaric crimes. I hate my past and hate the war of aggression. I want to oppose the war of aggression and fight for lasting peace. I think that doing so is the path that a person who has awakened his conscience should take. I request the court to severely punish me. This is right and just. I think this is also a warning to the imperialist elements who are plotting to launch a war of aggression."

After deliberation, the court opened on the morning of the 20th at 8 a.m. to announce the verdict. The Special Military Tribunal sentenced Takebe Rokuzo to 20 years in prison, Furuhata Tadashi to 18 years in prison, Saito Yoshio to 20 years in prison, Nakai Hisaji to 18 years in prison, Miyake Hideya to 18 years in prison, Yokoyama Mitsuhiko to 16 years in prison, Sugihara Ippaku to 18 years in prison, Sako Ryusuke to 18 years in prison, Hara Hiroshi to 16 years in prison, Kibe Yohei to 15 years in prison, Imayoshi Hitoshi to 16 years in prison, Utsugi Takeo to 13 years in prison, Taii Kujiro to 16 years in prison, Kimura Mitsuaki to 16 years in prison, Shimamura Saburo to 15 years in prison, Kage Shigehiro to 15 years in prison, Tsukidani Akizo to 15 years in prison, Yoshifusa Torao to 14 years in prison, Kashiwaba Yuichi to 15 years in prison, Fujiwara Hironoshin to 14 years in prison, Kamitsubo Tetsuichi to 12 years in prison, Hachisuka Shigeo to 12 years in prison, Horiguchi Masao to 12 years in prison, Nozaki Shigeyuki to 14 years in prison, Mizoguchi Yoshio to 15 years in prison, Shimura Yukio to 12 years in prison, Kobayashi Kiichi to 12 years in prison, and Nishinaga Shoji to 12 years in prison. The court ruled that the term of imprisonment for each defendant shall be calculated from the date of the verdict, and the number of days of detention before the verdict shall be offset against the term of imprisonment at the rate of one day for one day.
