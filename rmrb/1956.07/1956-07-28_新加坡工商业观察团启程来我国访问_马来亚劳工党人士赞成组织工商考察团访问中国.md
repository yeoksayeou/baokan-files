Xinhua News Agency, July 27th, Singapore Dispatch: The Singapore Industrial and Commercial Observation Group, led by head of the group, Mr. Ko Teck Kin, and secretary Mr. Yap Pheng Geck, along with twenty-five members, departed from here today by plane for a two-week visit to Japan. Afterwards, they will meet with the other thirty-five members of the delegation in Hong Kong and visit China in mid-August.

The Singapore Industrial and Commercial Observation Group includes representatives from rubber enterprises and other businesses.

Yap Pheng Geck said that Singapore's former Chief Minister, Mr. David Marshall, will join the observation group in Japan and will visit China as an advisor to the group. Yap Pheng Geck said that the industrial and commercial observation group will not participate in political discussions.

Xinhua News Agency, July 26th: According to Singaporean newspapers, a spokesperson for the Malacca branch of the Malayan Labour Party said on July 21st that developing normal trade relations between Malaya and its neighboring countries is beneficial to Malaya without any harm. The organization of any industrial and commercial inspection group is conducive to promoting Malaya's economic development.

The spokesperson criticized certain people who oppose the organization of industrial and commercial inspection groups to visit China. He said that opposing the organization of this visit is tantamount to hindering the country's economic prosperity and making it impossible to improve the lives of the working people of Malaya. This is an extremely unwise move. He said that if Malaya wants to develop its own economy, it must abandon political prejudices and strive to win markets for the country.

The spokesperson pointed out that Malaya once suffered significant losses from implementing an "embargo," because the "embargo" subjected Malaya's main export products - rubber and tin - to the manipulation of American capitalists.

    新加坡工商业观察团启程来我国访问  
    马来亚劳工党人士赞成组织工商考察团访问中国
    新华社27日讯　新加坡消息：新加坡工商业观察团团长高德根、秘书叶平玉和二十五个团员今天从这里乘飞机前往日本进行两星期的访问。随后他们将在香港同代表团的其他三十五个团员会合，在八月中旬到中国访问。
    新加坡工商业观察团包括橡胶企业和其他企业的代表。
    叶平玉说，新加坡前首席部长马歇尔将在日本同观察团会合，他将作为观察团的顾问一道到中国访问。叶平玉说，工商业观察团将不参加政治讨论。
    新华社26日讯　据新加坡报纸报道，马来亚劳工党马六甲地方组织发言人七月二十一日说，发展马来亚同邻国的正常贸易关系对马来亚是有百利而无一害的，任何工商业考察团的组织都有利于促进马来亚的经济发展。
    这位发言人批评某些反对组织工商业考察团访问中国的人。他说，反对组织这次访问等于是阻碍本国经济的繁荣，使得马来亚劳动人民的生活无法改善，这实在是极不明智的举动。他说，马来亚要想发展本身的经济，必须摒弃政治成见，竭力为本国争取市场。
    这位发言人指出，马来亚曾经施行“禁运”而遭到重大的损失，因为“禁运”使得马来亚的主要出口产品——橡胶和锡——都受到美国资本家的操纵。
