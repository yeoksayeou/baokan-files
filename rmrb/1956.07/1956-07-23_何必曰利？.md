   “Why Must We Speak of Profit?”
    Jin Xiulong
    The impression Confucius gives is that he only "talks about morality and preaches benevolence and righteousness," and doesn't value profit. But Confucius himself knew better, saying, for example, that it is difficult to be poor without resentment! This shows that he understood that "benevolence" and "righteousness" still need material sustenance, and empty talk is not enough.
    "Why Must We Speak of Profit?" as a favorite saying of scholars, probably originated with Mencius, because that was the first thing he said when he met King Hui of Liang. Since then, the followers of Confucius and Mencius have increasingly exaggerated this point, as if the development of the world depends only on reasoning. If there are more people in a society who can reason, the people can live on wind and dew without complaint.
    Reasoning must be done, and great principles especially must be emphasized. No country or society can function without great principles. But it is wrong to only talk about great principles and think that they can be eaten as food. Unfortunately, today there are already many people who spend their days talking about "enthusiasm," "awareness," and "increased production" as if they are capable, but are unwilling to consider how much income each of those who are both enthusiastic, aware, and have increased production earns each month or per labor day. What about those couples who both work, but have too many children, and still have to rely on relatives and friends to help make ends meet each month? Where do the workers sleep at night? How can they afford monthly passes when there is no shuttle bus or bicycle for getting to work? Some units hold endless meetings at night, but don't think that some people have to walk from the west side of the city to the eastern suburbs after the meetings! Many units allocate dormitories for cadres, but are not accustomed to considering that there should also be a place called a "kitchen" where meals can be cooked.
    The division of labor among some leading cadres now seems even more strict. Some people simply say that they are in charge of "ideological leadership" and don't care about anything else! Some people have walls full of books, but they can't see what Engels wrote: "As far as the intention of pursuing happiness is concerned, ideal rights are an extremely inadequate food. This intention must first be nourished by material means..." As early as nine hundred years ago, a scholar named Li Gou in our country was very dissatisfied with those pure talkers who only talked about great principles and did not care about people's material interests, and said: "The world's dislike of Confucianism is due to this."
    According to the State Council's recent survey of wage conditions in various places, and the All-China Federation of Trade Unions' survey of workers' welfare, there are still quite a few leaders in various places who are "Confucian" in their thinking! Their philosophy is: "You want the horse to run fast, but you don't want the horse to eat grass," which has resulted in many workers' living and welfare problems that should have been resolved long ago being delayed. Even things like soap for workers to wash their hands, and raincoats for train conductors, are difficult to obtain.
    The old Confucians, direct descendants of Confucius and Mencius, have already withdrawn from the historical stage, and new Confucians are beginning to act strangely. How do they understand socialism and how do they promote socialism? This is a question worthy of attention.

    “何必曰利？”
    金绣龙
    孔子给人的印象，好像只是“讲道德，说仁义”，并不看重利的。但孔子本人却心中有数，如说：贫而无怨，难！可见他很懂得，“仁”“义”还得靠物质营养，空口说白话，是不行的。
    “何必曰利”作为读书人的口头禅，大概起源于孟子，因为他去见梁惠王时，头一句话便说这个。自此之后，孔孟之徒便益发将此点加以夸大，好像世界的发展，只靠讲道理就行，一个社会中多有些讲道理的人，人民便可以餐风饮露而无怨了。
    道理得讲，大道理尤其得讲。任何一个国家、社会，离开了大道理，总是不行的。但只讲大道理，认为它可以当饭吃，便不对了。可惜的是，今天已经有不少人成天以讲“积极性”、“觉悟”、“增产”等等为能事，却不愿考虑那些既积极、觉悟又高，还增产了的人，每个月或每个劳动日的收入是多少？夫妇都工作，但孩子太多，每月还得靠亲友帮补过活的人，怎么办？职工们晚上睡在那里？上工既没有班车，又没有自行车，月票钱从何处出？有的单位夜里穷开会，却没有想到有人散会后得从西城走到东郊！不少单位为干部分配宿舍，却很不习惯考虑还该有个可供作饭的叫做“厨房”的地方。
    现在有些领导干部的分工，似更严密，有人干脆便说自己是管“思想领导”的，别的死活不管！有人满壁图书，可就是瞧不见恩格斯写过的：“就追求幸福的意向说来，理想的权利是一种极端不够的食品。这一意向，首先要靠物质手段来营养……”远在九百年前，我国有个叫李觏的学者，便对那些专讲大道理而不顾及人们物质利益的清谈家们十分不满，并且说：“世俗之不喜儒以此。”
    照国务院最近在各地调查工资情况、总工会调查劳动者的福利情况看，各地领导人中，沾“儒”气的还很不少！他们的哲学是：“又要马儿跑得好，又要马儿不吃草”，致使许多本应早日解决的职工生活福利问题，迟迟不得解决。甚至如有些职工需要洗手用的肥皂，列车员需要用的雨衣等等，也求告无门。
    作为孔孟嫡系的旧儒已经退出历史舞台，而新儒又在开始作怪。他们究竟怎样理解社会主义和怎样宣传社会主义的？这倒是个值得注意的问题了。
