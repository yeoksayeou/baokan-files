    Our friendly relations with Arab countries have experienced another gratifying development. Following Egypt's establishment of diplomatic relations with our country, the Syrian government made a decision on July 2 to recognize our country. Chinese Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai has sent a telegram to Syrian Foreign Minister Bitar, warmly welcoming the Syrian government's friendly decision and suggesting the formal establishment of diplomatic relations and the exchange of diplomatic envoys between China and Syria.
    China and Syria are geographically distant, but our two peoples have a long-standing historical relationship and thus understand each other. Both China and Syria are ancient countries in the world. As early as over a thousand years ago, the two countries began to have religious and cultural connections. There has always been friendly exchange, mutual respect, sympathy, and support between the two countries, and never any mutual hostility or conflict. After the founding of the Syrian Republic and the People's Republic of China, our common aspiration has been to consolidate national independence, safeguard world peace, and improve our respective economies and cultures. Therefore, neither geographical barriers nor artificial obstacles can prevent our mutual approach and friendly cooperation.
    Both China and Syria are active implementers of the Bandung Conference resolutions. Since that conference, both our countries have made great efforts to establish friendly relations and broad contacts with other countries. At the same time, the political, economic, and cultural relations between our two countries have become even closer. Since 1954, Syria has invited our country to participate in the Damascus International Fair every year. In November 1955, China and Syria signed a trade and payment agreement and decided to establish commercial representative offices in each other's capitals. Not long ago, the Chinese cultural and artistic delegation visited Syria, and our country also signed a cultural cooperation agreement with Syria. Meanwhile, mutual visits by government, parliamentary, and social figures between China and Syria have also increased. Friendship, like everything else that is alive in the world, grows under constant and diligent cultivation. The establishment of normal relations between China and Syria has long been the common desire of the people of both countries. Now, this desire is beginning to be realized, and the friendship between the Chinese and Syrian people has entered a new stage. The prospects for friendly cooperation between China and Syria are even broader.
    Syria's decision to recognize our country is a victory for its firm implementation of an independent and autonomous policy. This shows that Arab countries such as Egypt and Syria are determined to decide their national affairs according to their own national interests. In recent years, due to the great development of the anti-colonialist struggles of Arab countries such as Egypt and Syria, the historical face of the Middle East has been completely renewed. More and more countries disregard the interference of colonialists and resolutely and courageously embark on the road of pursuing a policy of independence and autonomy. It is impossible for colonialists to prevent Middle Eastern countries from pursuing a policy of peace and independence. Syria is an example. Colonialists have constantly threatened and interfered with Syria, demanding that it abandon its neutral policy, join Western military blocs, and oppose its friendly cooperation with countries around the world. But they did not achieve their goals, and they failed. The new Syrian government recently announced that it will continue to pursue a neutral policy. Syrian President Kuwatly also stated that Syria is willing to establish close cooperation with all countries that "respect justice and freedom and uphold the high principles of humanitarianism." Obviously, this policy of promoting international cooperation not only conforms to the interests of the Syrian people but also benefits world peace.
    Recently, Syrian President Kuwatly said at a banquet in honor of Soviet Foreign Minister Shepilov: "Syria responds to love with love, and to sincere relations with a grateful heart. It extends a friendly hand to everyone who responds to it in the same way." These words resonated in our hearts. The Chinese people have always cherished sincere friendship. There is an ancient Chinese saying: "Return a peach for a plum" - we know how to respond to friendship with friendship! We believe that the friendly relations between China and Syria will continue to develop. We also believe that the hand of friendship extended by the Chinese people to the whole world will receive more friendly responses.

### 欢迎叙利亚的友好决定

    欢迎叙利亚的友好决定
    我国和阿拉伯国家的友好关系，又有了令人喜悦的发展。继埃及同我国建交之后，叙利亚政府于七月二日作出决定，承认我国。我国外交部长周恩来已致电叙利亚外交部长比塔尔，热烈欢迎叙利亚政府的这一友好决定，并建议中叙两国正式建交和互派外交使节。
    中国和叙利亚的国土相距很远，但是我们两国人民有着很长远的历史关系，因此是互相了解的。中国和叙利亚都是世界上的古国。还在一千多年以前，两国就开始有了宗教和文化上的联系。在两国之间，一向只有友好的往来，只有互相尊敬、同情和支持，从来没有互相仇视和任何冲突。叙利亚共和国和中华人民共和国成立以后，我们的共同愿望是巩固民族独立，维护世界和平，以提高自己的经济和文化。因此，不论千山万水，不论人为的藩篱，都不能阻拦我们的互相接近和友好合作。
    中国和叙利亚都是万隆会议决议的积极执行者。在这个会议以后，我们两国为了同其他国家建立友好关系和广泛的联系，都作了很大的努力。同时，我们两国之间的政治、经济和文化关系也更加密切了。1954年以来，叙利亚每年邀请我国参加大马士革国际博览会。1955年11月，中国和叙利亚签订了贸易和支付协定，并决定在两国的首都互相设立商务代表处。不久以前，我国文化艺术代表团访问了叙利亚，我国并同叙利亚签订了文化合作协定。同时中国和叙利亚的政府、议会和社会人士的互相访问也增多了。友谊，它同世界上一切有生命的东西一样，是在不断的辛勤培育之下滋长的。中国同叙利亚建立正常关系，这早已是两国人民共同的愿望。现在，这个愿望开始实现了，中、叙两国人民的友谊从此进入了新的阶段。中、叙两国友好合作的前途更加广阔了。
    叙利亚决定承认我国，是它坚决执行独立自主政策的一个胜利。这说明埃及和叙利亚等阿拉伯国家，它们决心按照自己的民族利益来决定自己的国家事务。近些年来，由于埃及、叙利亚等阿拉伯国家反殖民主义斗争的巨大发展，中近东的历史面貌已经焕然一新。越来越多的国家蔑视殖民主义者的干涉，坚决而勇敢地走上执行独立自主政策的道路，殖民主义者想要阻挡中近东国家奉行和平、独立的政策是不可能的了。叙利亚就是一个例子。殖民主义者曾经不断对叙利亚进行威胁和干涉，要它放弃中立政策，加入西方军事集团，并且反对它同世界各国友好合作。但是，他们没有达到目的，他们失败了。叙利亚新政府最近宣布，它将继续奉行中立政策。叙利亚总统库阿特利并且表示，叙利亚愿意同“尊重正义和自由、卫护人道主义高度原则”的所有国家建立紧密的合作。显然，这种促进国际合作的政策，不仅符合叙利亚人民的利益，而且也有利于世界和平。
    最近，叙利亚总统库阿特利在招待苏联外交部长谢皮洛夫的宴会上说过：“叙利亚以爱来回答爱，以感谢的心情来回答真挚的关系，它向每一个用同样态度回答它的人伸出友好的手。”这一段话在我们的心里引起了共鸣。中国人民也一向珍视真挚的友谊。中国有一句古话：“投桃报李”——我们是懂得怎样以友谊来回答友谊的！我们相信，中国和叙利亚的友好关系将得到不断发展。我们也相信，中国人民向全世界伸出的友谊的手将得到更多的友好的回应。
