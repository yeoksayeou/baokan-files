    Welcome Newspapers to Care About the Suffering of the Masses
    Comrades in our office especially welcome the "Letters from Readers," "Readers' Opinions," and "Voices of the Masses" that have been published in the People's Daily recently. For example, the "Do Not Transport Towards Each Other," "Unable to Return Home," and "When Will We Reunite" published on the fourth page of the second day's newspaper were all considered very good by the comrades.

    欢迎报纸关心群众的疾苦
    我们机关里的同志，特别欢迎人民日报最近登载的一些“读者来信”，“读者意见”，“群众呼声”。例如二日报纸第四版登的“不要相向运输”、“有家归不得”、“何日得团圆”等，同志们都认为很好。
