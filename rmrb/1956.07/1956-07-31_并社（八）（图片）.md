(Adapted from Xu Guangyao's original work "Shuming and Yinghua")

29　Yinghua glanced at her father, moved closer to her mother, and casually chatted about the advanced cooperative. Yinghua talked about the planning of Willow Tree Village in such beautiful terms. She originally wanted to tell her father, but the more she spoke, the more excited she became, and even she herself was intoxicated by the beautiful vision of the plan.

30　Her mother listened with a degree of skepticism. Yinghua seized the opportunity to continue persuading her: "Hurry up and change your old ways of thinking." Her mother said: "Old ways of thinking don't hinder others." Yinghua said: "Some old ways of thinking involve taking advantage, fighting for power and dominance, how can they not hinder others!..."

31　Li Baichuan, eyes bulging, shouted in a rough voice: "Nonsense! I've provided you with six years of schooling, and all you've learned is to be glib!" With a "bang," he kicked the door open and went out, causing Li Da-ma to tremble with fright.

32　The sky was gradually darkening. Yinghua sighed deeply and asked her mother: "What exactly did Old Qiao say just now?" Her mother recounted the situation, and Yinghua felt somewhat anxious, so she hurriedly ran out.

    29　莺花溜了他爹一眼，凑近妈的身边，同妈随便谈了几句就谈到高级社的事儿来了，莺花把柳树屯的规划谈得多美。她原想说给她爹听，不想越说越兴奋，连自己也陶醉在规划的美好远景里了。
    30　她妈听得半信半疑，莺花趁机继续劝说：“快把老脑筋改一改吧。”妈说：“老脑筋又不碍别人。”莺花说：“有些老脑筋占奸取巧，争强争霸，怎么不碍别人！……”
    31　李百川爆着两眼，粗声喝道：“净胡说！供你坐了六年板凳，就学来些贫嘴！”“乒”的一声把门一踢就出去了，李大妈吓得直哆嗦。
    32　天色已经渐渐黑下来了。莺花深深叹了一口气，问妈：“老乔头刚才到底说了些什么？”妈把刚才的情形讲了一遍，莺花心里有些着慌，急急匆匆就跑出去了。
