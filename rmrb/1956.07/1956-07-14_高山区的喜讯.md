    Good News from the High Mountain Region
    Yang Hongde
    "For every foot higher the mountain, the soil is three feet colder." Can multi-season crops be grown in high mountain areas with altitudes of 1,000 to 2,000 meters? The experience of farmers in Baoxing County, a high mountain area in Sichuan Province, answers this question affirmatively.
    Last November, when the Camel Mountain peak was covered with snow, the members of the Pioneer Agricultural Production Cooperative in Longdong Township, Baoxing County, were busy harvesting for the third time on the hillside.
    "Three harvests a year in the high mountains?" The cooperative members initially didn't believe it. When the cooperative sowed the second season of potatoes, old man Jiang Yueming and some other veteran cooperative members were very worried. Old man Jiang said, "I'm over sixty years old, and I've never seen anyone harvest spring potatoes and then plant autumn potatoes!" He even made a bet that if the second season potatoes yielded a harvest, he would write his name backwards. But the facts seemed to be playing a joke on him. Last year, the Pioneer Cooperative planted two seasons of potatoes and one season of corn on four mu of land at altitudes between 1,600 and 1,900 meters using intercropping methods. The average yield was 3,850 jin of potatoes and 350 jin of corn per mu, which was more than five times the yield of planting only one season in previous years, creating a new record for grain production increase in high mountain areas. The intercropping method was: when the first season of potatoes was about to mature, corn was sown in the empty rows of the potatoes; when the corn was about to mature, the second season of potatoes was sown in the rows where the potatoes had been planted. On the day the second season of potatoes was harvested, more than a hundred primary school students came to congratulate the harvest. Old man Jiang Yueming, who previously didn't believe that potatoes could be harvested, said happily at this time: "There are many new things in the new society, we never thought of these methods before! You learn as long as you live, and now we have to do things we never did in the past."
    The Pioneer Agricultural Production Cooperative is a key cooperative led by the Baoxing County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party. This cooperative is located on the ridge and hillside of Camel Mountain, at an altitude of 1,600 to 1,900 meters, with a sunny terrain. The frost-free period is about 210 days, and most of the cultivated land is sloping, without water storage facilities. The soil has medium fertility.
      In the spring of 1954, after the county committee led the farmers here to transform from mutual aid groups into agricultural cooperatives, a technical research group and a crop experiment department were established in the cooperative. With the assistance of the county's agricultural technology guidance station, a group of farmer technicians have conducted twelve kinds of experiments in the past two years, including potato vernalization, Maltsev's new cultivation method, and phosphorus fertilizer comparison. Most of them have been successfully tested and promoted in the cooperative. Last year, these four mu of land planted with three seasons of crops were the experimental fields of the technical group. In addition, last year they also planted two seasons of buckwheat on 25 mu of high and cold land with very poor soil above 1,900 meters above sea level, with an average yield of 470 jin per mu; then they planted a season of rapeseed. These facts have powerfully refuted the local habit of saying "one seedling of dew, one seedling of grass, two seasons of crops are not reliable." After the Pioneer Agricultural Cooperative achieved its third harvest, the good news that "three harvests a year in the high mountains" spread like a spring breeze to nearby villages.
    This year, the Baoxing County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party summarized the experience of the Pioneer Agricultural Cooperative in increasing production with three harvests a year. In early February, it convened a meeting attended by more than 300 people, including county, district, and township staff, agricultural cooperative chairmen, production team leaders, and all rural party members, introduced this experience, and organized discussions. In late February, the county also held agricultural cooperative technician training courses in districts, explaining the specific methods of this experience. The vast majority of agricultural cooperatives in the county have formulated plans to change from one season to two or three seasons, according to local conditions, and have generally launched early potato planting work. This year, the replanting area in the high mountain areas of the county has expanded by 40%. Yu Chengliang, an old farmer in his forties, said meaningfully: "One mu is worth ten mu. If we continue to improve technology and accept new things, why worry that socialism will not come to the high mountains!"

    高山区的喜讯
    杨鸿德
    “山高一丈，土冷三尺”，在海拔一千公尺到二千多公尺的高山区，是否能生长多季作物呢？四川省高山区宝兴县农民的经验肯定地回答了这个问题。
    去年十一月份，当白雪复盖着骆驼山顶的时候，宝兴县陇东乡先锋农业生产合作社的社员们，正忙碌地在山坡上进行第三次收获。
    “高山一年能三熟”，社员开初都不相信。在合作社播种二季马铃薯的时候，社员姜月明老大爷和其他一些老社员都很耽心。姜老大爷说：“我六十几岁了，没见过收了春洋芋，还能种秋洋芋！”他还打赌，如果二季洋芋有收成的话，他愿把名字倒写。可是事实好像偏偏和他开玩笑。先锋社去年在海拔一千六百公尺到一千九百公尺之间的四亩土地里，用套种方法，种了两季马铃薯和一季玉米，平均每亩共收了马铃薯三千八百五十斤，玉米三百五十斤，比上年种一季的时候多收了五倍多，创造了高山区粮食增产的新纪录。套种的办法是：第一季马铃薯快成熟的时候，在马铃薯的空行内播种玉米；在玉米快成熟的时候，又在原先种马铃薯的行内再播种第二季马铃薯。当二季马铃薯收获那天，一百多个小学生前来祝贺丰收。原先不相信马铃薯能有收获的姜月明老大爷这时也高兴的说：“新社会名堂多，我们原先就想不到这些办法！做到老，学到老，过去没干过的，现在都要干了。”
    先锋农业生产合作社是中共宝兴县委领导的重点社。这个社处在骆驼山的山脊和山腰地带，海拔高度在一千六百至一千九百公尺之间，地势向阳。无霜期大约有二百一十天，耕地多半是坡地，没有储水设备。土壤有中等肥力。
      1954年春，县委领导这里的农民由互助组转为农业社以后，便在社里建立了技术研究小组和农作物试验部。一批农民技术员在县农业技术指导站的协助下，两年来，曾作过马铃薯春化、马尔采夫的新耕作法、磷肥对比等十二种试验。大多数都试验成功并在社里推广了。去年这四亩种三季作物的土地，就是技术小组的试验地。另外，他们去年还在拔海一千九百公尺以上高寒地带、土质很坏的二十五亩地上种了两季荞子，平均每亩共收了四百七十斤；接着又种了一季油菜。这些事实，都有力地批驳了当地的“一苗露水一苗草，两季庄稼靠不倒”的习惯说法。当先锋农业社得到了第三次收获以后，“高山一年能三熟”的喜讯，像春风一样吹遍了附近的村庄。
    今年中共宝兴县委总结了先锋农业社一年三熟的增产经验，二月初召集了县、区、乡工作人员，农业合作社社长、生产队长和全体农村党员共三百多人参加的会议，介绍了这项经验，组织了讨论。二月下旬，全县又以区为单位举办了农业社技术员训练班，交代了这项经验的具体作法。全县绝大部分农业社都因地制宜地订出了改种一季为两季、三季的计划，并普遍开展了早马铃薯的播种工作。今年，全县高山区复种面积扩大40％。四十多岁的老农民余成亮意味深长地说：“一亩顶十亩，我们再不断的改进技术，接受新东西，何愁社会主义不到高山上来！”
