Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing: The Nanjing Glass Factory, a joint state-private enterprise in Nanjing, has recently successfully trial-produced a type of insulated cup. When hot boiled water, hot milk, or hot coffee is poured into this insulated cup and the lid is closed, after four to five hours, the lid can be opened, and the contents are still steaming and pleasantly warm.

This insulated cup is made of two layers of glass with a vacuum in between. When boiling water is poured inside, the outside remains cool to the touch. The inner surfaces of both layers of glass are plated with silver, resembling the color of the silver cups we usually see on podiums, shimmering and sparkling. These cups will soon be available to consumers.

    保暖杯试制成功
    据新华社南京讯　南京市公私合营南京玻璃厂，新近试制成功一种保暖杯。在这种保暖杯里冲进热开水、热牛奶或热咖啡，盖好杯盖，过四小时到五小时以后，掀开杯盖仍然热气腾腾，温热可口。
    这种保暖杯是用两层玻璃制成的，中间真空，里面冲进沸水，外边一点也不烫手，在保暖杯两层玻璃的里面，都镀过白银，就像我们平常在给奖台上所见到的银杯的色泽一样，闪闪发光。这种杯子不久就将同消费者见面了。
