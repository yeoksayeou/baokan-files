    “Selling with Small Scales, Buying with Large Scales”
    The farmer Zhang Zhengfu bought a pound of salt at the Second District Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Longshan County, Xiangxi Miao Autonomous Prefecture, but it only weighed fourteen ounces when he got home. It turned out that nearby farmers were all experiencing this. It is understood that this supply and marketing cooperative has a total of five scales: three are short by one to two ounces, and two are heavy by one to two ounces. They are "selling with small scales, buying with large scales." (Zhang Jianmin)

    “小秤卖、大秤买”
    农民张正福在湘西苗族自治州龙山县第二区供销社买了一斤食盐，回家一称只有十四两；原来附近农民都有这种遭遇。据了解，这个供销社共有五把秤：三把少一至二两，二把多一至二两。他们是“小秤卖出，大秤买进。”（张健民）
