    "Moved to Tears"
    By Kotani Go, Japan

    Editor's Note: During the performance tour of the Chinese Peking Opera Delegation in Japan, Japanese newspapers published many commentaries reflecting the views of people with various opinions. Here is a translation of an article originally published in the "Asahi Shimbun" on June 24th. The author is a Japanese novelist.

    It's a bit embarrassing to say it, but honestly, I really shed tears while watching Peking Opera. Why did I cry at that time? Now, let me analyze it.

    I am originally someone who likes to argue with others. When others cry, I don't. I don't easily empathize with people, and I even laugh when watching tragedies. However, when I see something beautiful and complete, I can't help but choke up and be moved to tears unconditionally.

    Perhaps some people will think I'm just infatuated with Peking Opera and blindly praising it, which is too naive. But even if someone looks down on me, I'm not afraid. I was truly moved by Peking Opera.

    Before watching the opera, I had reminded myself to try to look at it with malice. My nature is that the more people praise something and put it on a pedestal, the more I want to nitpick, make harsh criticisms, and try my best to find some flaws in it. Even if it's just finding a small loophole like a toothpick, as long as I can conclude, "How boring this is," that's how I felt when I entered the theater.

    Because I am such a person, I have never been willing to read articles in newspapers and magazines that praise Peking Opera. I didn't even read the plot summary I received when I entered, just to see if I could understand it without any prior knowledge or relying on the plot summary. As a result, as I mentioned earlier, I was actually moved to tears. Peking Opera is so beautiful, so interesting, and so complete. It can be fully understood just by watching it, without any prior knowledge or reading the summary.

    It is very similar to Japanese Kabuki and Noh theater, and also has similarities with opera and operetta. However, I don't quite agree with comparing Peking Opera to these things. Specialists and critics are another matter. For people like us, I think it's best to just watch Peking Opera for itself when watching it. You can understand it more accurately when not comparing it to other things.

    Among the programs on the first day, "The Jade Bracelet" and "The Crossroads" were particularly interesting. They are dance and martial arts programs that can be appreciated unconditionally.

    Putting these aside, after watching Peking Opera, I suddenly had a thought: the Japanese should have more confidence in themselves in all aspects. Just as the new Chinese government and people are confidently promoting Peking Opera, the Japanese should also confidently promote their own good things—especially today, when we have lost confidence in everything.

### “感动得落下泪来”

    “感动得落下泪来”
    日本　小谷刚
     编者按：中国访日京剧代表团在日本各地公演期间，日本
    报纸刊载了不少评论文章，反映了具有各种不同见解的人士的
    观感。这里译载的一篇原载六月二十四日“朝日新闻”。作者
    是日本的小说作家。
    说出口来不免有些羞涩，老实讲，我在看京剧的时候真的落下了泪来。当时为什么要落泪呢？现在，让我来分析一下。
    我本来是一个爱反驳别人的人，人家哭，我不哭。不轻易与人共鸣，看悲剧我反而会笑起来。但是，当我看了那种美好的、完整的东西之后，恰恰止不住自己的哽咽，无条件地会激动得落下泪来。
    也许这样说有人会认为我是被京剧给迷住了，在这儿瞎捧一通，太幼稚了；但是，即使有人轻视我，我也不怕，我的的确确为京剧所感动了。
    在看戏之前，我曾提醒过自己，尽量用恶意去看，我的性情是人们越夸奖、越捧上天去的东西，我则越要吹毛求疵，加以酷苛的挑剔，尽力找出它一些毛病来。那怕是像剔牙棍那样钻点小空子，只要能得出“这多么无聊呀”的结论就好，这就是我走进剧场时的心情。
    由于我是这样的一个人，所以至今凡是夸奖京剧的报纸和杂志的文章，我都不愿意读下去，入场时拿到的剧情说明书也不去念它，试试看，毫无预备知识；离开剧情说明究竟能否看得懂。这样作的结果，正如刚才提到的那样，我竟感动得落下了泪来，京剧实在太美、太有趣味、太完整了，没有预备知识、不看说明，光靠看是完全可以理解透的。
    和日本的歌舞伎和“能”乐很相似，和歌剧、小歌剧也有类似之处，但和这许多东西对照着来观赏京剧我是不大同意的，专门批评家则另当别论，像我们这样的人，我认为看京剧时光看京剧本身好啦，不和其他东西比较，反而更能正确地理解京剧。
    头一天的节目中尤以“拾玉镯”、“三岔口”两出戏最有兴味，是可以无条件地加以欣赏的舞蹈和短打的节目。
    姑且不论这些，当我看了京剧之后，突然地产生了一个念头：日本人在各方面应该更加相信自己才对。如同新中国政府和人民满怀信心地发扬京剧一样，日本人也应该抱有信心地发扬自己的那些好的东西——尤其是当在任何事物面前都失掉自信心的今天。
