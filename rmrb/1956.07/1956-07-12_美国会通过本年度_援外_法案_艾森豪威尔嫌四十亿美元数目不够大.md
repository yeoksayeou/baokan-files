Xinhua News Agency, Washington, July 11th: The US Congress passed the "Foreign Aid" authorization bill totaling $4,002,700,000 in both houses on July 9th. The bill has been submitted to President Eisenhower for signature.

Adding the newly authorized figure to the $87.5 million reauthorized for use, the total amount of so-called "foreign aid" funds for the US fiscal year 1957 will reach $4,115,000,000.

The allocation of the newly authorized figure is: $2,225,000,000 for "Military Assistance," $1,175,000,000 for "Economic Assistance," $293,000,000 for "Development Assistance," $157,500,000 for "Technical Cooperation," and $176,800,000 for other programs, including a $100 million President's Special Fund.

The US government originally requested $4.9 billion in "foreign aid" funds for this fiscal year. During the congressional debate, given the strong sentiment in favor of cutting foreign "aid," the government proposed a so-called minimum figure essential for the "security" of the "free world": $4.5 billion. The amount finally passed by both houses was significantly less than both of these figures.

Almost at the same time as both houses passed the final authorization figure, Eisenhower issued a statement saying that it would be "a serious mistake" and not in "America's best interests" if Congress did not restore "a substantial portion" of the funds that had been cut. Eisenhower said: "It is not enough to spend defense funds solely on our armed forces; we must continue to build common security through cooperation with foreign friends." According to him, failure to restore "foreign aid" funds would lead to "dictatorship or foreign rule" in those countries.

Reports say that Eisenhower is preparing to meet with leaders of both parties in Congress to seek more appropriations.

### 美国会通过本年度“援外”法案  艾森豪威尔嫌四十亿美元数目不够大

    美国会通过本年度“援外”法案
    艾森豪威尔嫌四十亿美元数目不够大
    据新华社11日讯　华盛顿消息：美国国会两院在七月九日分别通过了数达四十亿零二千七百万美元的“援外”授权法案，这项法案已经提交给总统艾森豪威尔签署。
    这笔新授权的数字再加上重新授权使用的八千七百五十万美元，美国在1957财政年度的所谓“援外”经费，总数将达四十一亿一千五百万美元。
    新授权数字的分配是：“军事援助”二十二亿二千五百万美元，“经济援助”十一亿七千五百万美元，“开发援助”二亿九千三百万美元，“技术合作”一亿五千七百五十万美元，用于其他计划的一亿七千六百八十万美元，其中包括总统特别基金一亿美元。
    美国政府原来为本财政年度要求的“援外”款项为四十九亿美元，在国会讨论过程中，鉴于主张削减对外“援助”的情绪的强烈，政府又提出了一个所谓对“自由世界”的“安全”必不可少的最低数字：四十五亿美元。两院最后通过的款项比这两个数字都大大减少了。
    几乎在两院通过最后授权数字的同时，艾森豪威尔发表声明说，如果国会不把削减掉的款项恢复“很大一部分”，就是“一个严重的错误”，不符合“美国的最高利益”。艾森豪威尔说：“把防务经费光用在我们的武装部队上是不够的，我们必须通过同外国朋友的合作来继续建立共同安全。”据他说，如果不恢复“援外”款项，就会在那些国家里导致“独裁或者外国的统治”。
    有消息说，艾森豪威尔正准备为争取多一些拨款而召见国会两党领袖。
