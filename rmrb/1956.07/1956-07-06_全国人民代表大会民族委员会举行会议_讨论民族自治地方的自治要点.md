Xinhua News Agency, July 5th: The "Key Points of Autonomy in Ethnic Autonomous Areas of the People's Republic of China" was the central topic at the third meeting of the National People's Congress Nationalities Committee. 112 committee members and people's representatives from thirty ethnic groups engaged in group discussions, proposing eighty-nine amendments and supplementary opinions. They unanimously agreed that these key points of autonomy for ethnic autonomous areas, drafted according to the draft constitution, are a concrete basis for guiding the people of various ethnic autonomous areas, under the leadership of the Communist Party, to transition to socialism and establish autonomous areas of people's democracy, representing the wishes of the people of all ethnic groups.

Representative Yang Fuxing (Tibetan) said: Drafting such key points represents the wishes of all ethnic groups. Committee member Ngawang Jigme (Tibetan) said: Socialism is the path to a bright and happy future for everyone; only a madman would not want to take this path. Committee members and representatives were particularly interested in the sections on economic and cultural education construction, believing that the economic construction policy of vigorously developing the state-owned economy and the cooperative economy, and accelerating the continuous increase in the proportion of socialist economic components in the national economy, is correct. Representative Luo Wencai (Miao) said, after discussing the large proportion of sideline occupations in the income of people of various ethnic groups: The omission of developing sideline occupations in the key points is a defect. This opinion was immediately supported by Representative Suo Guanying (Tibetan). Committee member Su Xin (Qiang) added: It should be explicitly stipulated that sideline occupations be developed in an organized manner to avoid blindness. Some representatives also proposed supplementary opinions on building water conservancy projects. When discussing cultural and educational construction, they unanimously agreed that "ethnic autonomous areas should promote Marxism-Leninism, establish socialist ideology, and develop cultural and educational undertakings with socialist content and ethnic forms" is a complete cultural and educational policy. Many people believe that cultural development is urgently needed for building socialism. Representative Wu Wencai (Yi) said: Due to cultural backwardness, all aspects of work have been affected. He criticized the slow progress of helping ethnic minorities create and develop writing systems. Representative Wu Huanhu (Miao) said: Ethnic minority cadres are resolute in completing their tasks, but their political and cultural level is low, and they do not follow the actual situation in execution, which prevents the work from being done well. He believes that it should be pointed out in the key points that effectively training ethnic minority cadres is an urgent task. Some representatives also mentioned that the key points should be supplemented with opinions on training women cadres.

Participants in the meeting raised 239 criticisms of various tasks in ethnic minority areas. Representative Ahou Lumuze (Yi) said: The achievements in ethnic work are the main aspect, but in order to do the work better, it is also necessary to point out shortcomings. He criticized the Han cadres working with him for not consulting with him enough on matters, and also criticized the lack of respect shown by individual Communist Party members among Yi lower-level cadres towards higher-level non-Party Yi cadres. Representative Yang Fuxing (Tibetan), in criticizing the shortcomings in united front work, said that there is still a phenomenon of "those who should be united have not been united."

Committee member Xirao Gyatso (Tibetan) said in his speech that both democratic reform and socialist transformation should take into account the characteristics of ethnic minority areas. He said: For example, in pastoral areas where conditions are not yet mature, we must take it slowly. Taking it slowly is faster, and taking it fast is slower.

Liu Geping, Chairman of the National People's Congress Nationalities Committee, announced at today's closing ceremony: The Nationalities Committee will revise the draft key points based on everyone's opinions. He believes that everyone's criticisms of practical work will promote future work.

This meeting was held in Beijing on the 2nd and lasted for four days.

Xinhua News Agency, July 5th: The National People's Congress Nationalities Committee hosted a banquet at the Beijing Hotel at noon today, to entertain the 112 committee members and representatives from the thirty ethnic minorities from across the country who came to Beijing to participate in the third meeting of the National People's Congress Nationalities Committee.

    全国人民代表大会民族委员会举行会议
    讨论民族自治地方的自治要点
    新华社5日讯　“中华人民共和国民族自治地方自治要点”是全国人民代表大会民族委员会第三次会议上的中心议题。来自三十个民族的委员和人民代表共112人，他们分组展开讨论，提出八十九条修正和补充意见。一致认为根据宪法草案拟出来的这个民族自治地方自治要点，是使各民族自治地方人民在共产党领导下过渡到社会主义、建立人民民主的自治地方的具体依据，它代表了各民族人民的愿望。
    代表杨复兴（藏族）说：草拟这样一个要点是代表了各族人民的愿望的。委员阿旺嘉措（藏族）说：社会主义是使每个人走向光明幸福的道路，只有疯人才不愿走这条道路。委员和代表们对经济和文化教育建设部分特别感到兴趣，认为大力发展国营经济和合作经济、加速社会主义经济成分在国民经济中的比重不断增长的经济建设方针是正确的。代表罗文才（苗族）谈了副业在各民族人民收入中占很大比重以后说：要点里没有提出发展副业是个缺陷。这个意见立刻得到代表索观瀛（藏族）的支持。委员苏新（羌族）补充说：应该明文规定有组织地发展副业，以避免盲目性。有些代表还提出兴修水利的补充意见。讨论到文化教育建设时，一致认为“各民族自治地方应当宣传马克思列宁主义、树立社会主义思想，发展社会主义内容的、民族形式的文化教育事业”，是一条完整的文教方针。许多人认为建设社会主义迫切需要文化。代表伍文才（彝族）说：由于文化落后，已影响到工作的各个方面。他对帮助少数民族创造和发展文字的工作进展太慢，提出了批评。代表吴焕彧（苗族）说：民族干部完成工作任务是坚决的，但是政治文化水平低，执行中不按实际情况，因而使工作没有作好。他认为应该在要点中指出有效地培养民族干部是一项急要的工作。有的代表还提到在要点中须要补充培养妇女干部的意见。
    参加会议的人们对民族地区的各项工作，提出了239条批评意见。代表阿候鲁木子（彝族）说：民族工作中的成绩是主要的，但为了使工作做得更好，也需要指出缺点。他批评了和他共事的汉族干部遇事和他协商不够，也批评了彝族下级干部中的个别中共党员对上级非党彝族干部不够尊重的现象。代表杨复兴（藏族）在批评统战工作中的缺点时说，还存在“应该团结没有团结”的现象。
    委员喜饶嘉错（藏族）在发言中说，民主改革和社会主义改造都应该照顾民族地区特点，他说：比如条件尚不成熟的牧区，就要慢慢来。慢慢来就快了，快快来就慢了。
    全国人民代表大会民族委员会主任委员刘格平在今天的闭幕式上宣布：民族委员会将根据大家的意见修改草拟的这个要点。他认为大家对实际工作提出批评意见，给今后工作有推动作用。
    这次会议是二日在北京召开的。历时四天。
