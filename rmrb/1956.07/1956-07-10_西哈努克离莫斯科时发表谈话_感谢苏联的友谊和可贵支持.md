Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 9th July. According to TASS, Prince Norodom Sihanouk of Cambodia, the current Prime Minister Khim Tit, and other Cambodian guests, departed from Moscow on July 9th.

Prince Sihanouk said at the airport that the joint communique signed by the Soviet Union and Cambodia was warmly welcomed by all Cambodians. They believe that the friendship of the Soviet Union is a valuable guarantee of peace for our motherland, and the selfless technical and material assistance provided to us by the Soviet Union will greatly help modernize our country's technical equipment and improve the living standards of our people.

The valuable support given by the Soviet Union to Cambodia is beneficial to the welfare of the people of Asian countries and further proves the Soviet Union's sincere hope to make great contributions to the cause of peace and international cooperation.

Cambodia, a neutral country that fervently defends its independence, expresses its gratitude to the Soviet Union for providing generous assistance to Cambodia unconditionally, both now and in the future.

Furthermore, the Soviet Union helps us by considering our actual needs, and therefore its efforts will be transformed into practical and beneficial achievements, bringing direct benefits to the Cambodian people. This is the result of my sincere and frank talks with the Soviet leaders.

Bulganin, Malenkov, Shepilov, Furtseva and others were at the airport to see the guests off.

Diplomatic envoys from various countries to Moscow also went to the airport to see them off.
