    The Soviet Union's Radio Industry
    Light and Beautiful Radios
    The Soviet radio industry will manufacture several new types of radios in the second half of this year. They will all have ultra-shortwave, medium wave, and shortwave bands, and will not only have clear sound but also very attractive styles. The "Heilongjiang" brand radio has tubes that are only the size of a finger. In addition, the weight and power consumption of the new radios have been greatly reduced. For example, a Class 1 "Latvia" radio weighs 18 kilograms, which is 1.7 kilograms lighter than a Class 1 "Peace" brand radio. The "Traveler" brand radio is specifically designed for travel and can receive long and short waves. The radio and its accessories together weigh only 2.4 kilograms.
    
    Televisions Suitable for Group Viewing
    There have also been great improvements in the manufacturing of televisions. This year, 150,000 new-style televisions will be produced. The new televisions will use square screens instead of the old round screens, and the screen area will be larger, making it clearer for viewers. The sound will also be better than before, as with the "Alliance" and "Banner" brand televisions. To facilitate group viewing, projection televisions with a projection area of about one square meter are currently being prepared for production.

    75 Television Stations by 1960
    According to Soviet Radio Industry Minister Kalmykov in the newspaper, a large number of radios and televisions will be produced during the Sixth Five-Year Plan. In 1960 alone, approximately ten million radios and televisions will be produced, which is equal to the total number produced from 1951 to 1955. By the end of the Sixth Five-Year Plan, there will be 41 million radios and 8 million televisions, averaging one radio or television for every four or five people. Currently, the Soviet Union has 13 television stations, and by 1960 there will be 75.

    苏联的无线电工业
    又轻便又美丽的收音机
    苏联无线电工业在今年下半年将制造出几种新式无线电收音机。它们都具有超短波、中波和短波波段，不仅声音清楚，而且样式也很好看。“黑龙江”牌收音机它的灯泡只有指头般大小。此外新收音机的重量和所需电能大为减少，例如一级“拉托维亚”收音机重十八公斤，比一级“和平”牌收音机轻一点七公斤。“旅行家”牌收音机是专门用于旅行的，可以收长短波，收音机及其附件一共只二点四公斤重。
    便于集体看的电视机
    在电视机的制造方面也有很大改进，今年将生产十五万个新式电视机。新式电视机将用方形幕代替过去的圆形幕，幕的面积较过去大，观众看起来比较清楚，声音也比以前的好，如“联盟”和“旗帜”牌电视机。为了便于集体看，目前正准备出产投影电视机，投影面积约一平方公尺。
    1960年将有75座电视台
    据苏联无线电工业部部长加尔梅可夫在报纸上说：第六个五年计划期间将大量生产无线电收音机和电视机。仅在1960年即将生产约一千万架收音机和电视机，等于1951—1955年所生产的总数。到第六个五年计划结束时，将有四千一百万架收音机和八百万架电视机，平均每四、五人可有一架收音机或电视机。目前苏联有十三座电视台，到1960年将有七十五座。
