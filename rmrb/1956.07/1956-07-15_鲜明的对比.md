    A Stark Contrast
    The Zaohetian Agricultural Cooperative and the Gongyi Agricultural Cooperative in Qujiang Township, Yongxin County, Jiangxi Province, are neighboring cooperatives with roughly the same number of member households and similar conditions. However, after half a year of running advanced cooperatives, their sideline income differs greatly: Zaohetian Cooperative's income reached over 900 yuan, while Gongyi Cooperative's income was less than 200 yuan. The members of Zaohetian Cooperative are becoming more and more motivated, while the members of Gongyi Cooperative are currently struggling financially, complaining that after transitioning to an advanced cooperative, they don't even have money to buy cooking oil and salt, and their enthusiasm for production is low.

    Why is there such a big difference between two cooperatives with similar conditions? The main problem lies in the management thinking of the cooperative cadres. From the beginning, Zaohetian Cooperative educated its members through accounting methods and developed diversified operations according to local conditions, such as making paper pulp, weaving mats, raising fish, cutting timber, carrying wood, and raising pigs. They actively engaged in anything that could increase income and was feasible to operate. According to the cooperative's calculations, each full-time laborer in the cooperative will have an average annual sideline income of 80 yuan.

    The approach of Gongyi Cooperative was different. The cooperative cadres and some members were greedy for big projects and disliked small ones, only wanting to cut timber and raft logs for the Forestry Bureau. However, the state has a plan for timber felling, and there wasn't that much timber to be felled. Some members suggested developing sidelines such as raising pigs, making paper pulp, extracting camphor oil, and burning charcoal, but the cooperative cadres disliked these sidelines because they were not profitable enough and did not organize their operation. Some were only done once before being stopped.

    This cooperative failed to grasp the big opportunities and abandoned the small ones, resulting in nothing gained, which greatly affected the lives of the members. This stark contrast illustrates a problem of thought in leading sideline production. (Zhang Tao, Lan Shang)

    鲜明的对比
    江西永新县曲江乡的早禾田农业合作社和公益农业合作社是两个邻居社，它们的社员户数和其他条件都差不多。但是，半年来办高级社的结果，两个社的副业收入却相差很大：早禾田社的收入达九百多元，公益社的收入却不到二百元。早禾田社的社员越干越有劲；公益社的社员目前手头很紧，埋怨转成高级社连买油盐钱也没有了，生产情绪不高。
    两个条件差不多的社为什么有这么大的差别呢？主要毛病就发生在社干部的经营思想上。早禾田社一开始就通过算账方式，向社员进行教育，因地制宜地开展多种经营，如造纸浆、打席、养鱼、砍木材、背木头、养猪等，凡是能增加收入而又可能经营的，都积极经营。根据这个社的计算，全社平均每个整劳动力全年将有八十元的副业收入。
    公益社的做法就不同了。社干部和部分社员在副业上贪大厌小，光想去给森林工业局砍木头放木排，可是国家伐木材是有计划的，要伐的木材并没有那么多。有些社员提议发展养猪、制纸浆、熬樟脑油、烧木炭等副业，社干部却嫌这些副业利小而不去组织经营，有的也只是做了一次便停止了。
    这个社大的没抓住，小的放弃了，结果什么也没捞到，社员生活受了很大影响。这个鲜明的对比，说明了领导副业生产上的一个思想问题。　（张涛　蓝尚）
