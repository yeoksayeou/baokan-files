    Amidst the high tide of socialist transformation and construction:
    Over Ten Thousand People Join the Party in Five Months
    (Our dispatch) The production of the Beijing No. 2 Ramie Production Cooperative has increased month by month this year, not only completing the plan every month, but also overfulfilling it every month. When old worker Jia Liancheng in the cooperative talked about this, he always said: "Since the cooperative had a Party organization this year, production has undergone a great change. With the Party, people have political minds and a direction to move forward!"
    This cooperative had only one Party member last year. During the high tide of socialist transformation, five more workers joined the Party. They had all undergone several years of cultivation and education, and were further educated and examined in the high tide of socialism. After joining the Party, they became more active in their work, taking the lead in everything and consulting with the masses on everything. As a result, they reversed the abnormal production situation in the past and smoothly expanded the cooperative.
    Many grassroots organizations like this, which previously had no Party organizations or members, have been established during this year's high tide of socialist transformation and socialist construction. According to statistics, Beijing developed 11,510 Party members from January to May this year, which is equivalent to the number developed in the entire last year.
    In joint state-private factories, stores, and handicraft cooperatives, there were very few Party members in the past. This year, in conjunction with the high tide of socialist transformation, a group of activists were selected and trained, and 1,413 people were actively and cautiously accepted into the Party from January to May.
    Since liberation, after several political movements and long-term cultivation and education by Party organizations, many senior intellectuals have improved their awareness. From January to May this year, seventy-six university professors and lecturers, forty-one engineers, and thirteen attending physicians or higher have been accepted into the Party one after another. Their joining the Party has reversed the tendency of some senior intellectuals to not care about politics, sparked enthusiasm for political study, and many people have also made plans to advance towards science, expressing their willingness to strive to join the Party with practical actions. Their joining the Party will play a significant role in strengthening the Party's leadership over scientific and cultural undertakings, uniting all intellectuals to advance towards science and culture, and changing the backward state of science and culture.
    Three hundred and fifty primary and secondary school teachers and staff also joined the Party ranks in January to May this year. (Winter)

    在社会主义改造和建设高潮中
    五个月有一万多人入党
    本报讯　北京市第二麻绳生产合作社今年的生产一个月比一个月高，不但月月完成计划，而且月月超额完成计划。社里的老工人贾连城和人谈起这事的时候，总是这么说：“自从今年社里有了党组织，生产就大改样了。有了党，人就有了政治头脑，有了前进的方向！”
    这个社去年只有一个党员。在社会主义改造高潮中，又有五个工人入党。他们都经过几年的培养教育，在社会主义高潮中又进一步受到了教育和考察。他们在入党后，工作更积极了，事事带头，有事就找群众商量，因而扭转了过去生产不正常的现象，并顺利地扩建了社。
    许多像这样没有党组织和党员的基层组织，在今年的社会主义改造和社会主义建设高潮中都建立了起来。据统计，今年一月至五月北京市发展了党员11，510人，相当于去年全年发展的数字。
    在公私合营工厂、商店和手工业合作社中，过去党员很少。今年结合社会主义改造高潮挑选和训练了一批积极分子，从一月到五月并且积极慎重地接收了1，413人入党。
    解放几年来，经过多次政治运动和党组织长期培养教育，许多高级知识分子觉悟都有所提高。今年一至五月，七十六位大学教授讲师、四十一位工程师、十三位主治医师以上的大夫，都先后被接受入党。他们的入党，扭转了一些高级知识分子不过问政治的偏向，掀起了政治学习的热情，许多人还订了向科学进军的计划，表示要以实际行动争取入党；他们的入党对加强党对科学文化事业的领导，团结全体知识分子向科学文化进军，改变科学文化落后的状况将起不小的作用。
    三百五十名中小学教职员，在今年一至五月也陆续地参加到党的队伍中来。（冬）
