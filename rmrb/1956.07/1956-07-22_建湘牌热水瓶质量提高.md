    Jianxiang Brand Thermos Quality Improves

    Xinhua News Agency dispatch: The Jianxiang brand thermos, once called a "time bomb" by consumers, has now been rated as a first-class product nationwide. This assessment took place at the National Thermos Professional Conference in June.

    The Jianxiang brand thermos is produced by the Changsha Municipal Joint State-Private Jianxiang Enamel Thermos Factory. This factory was built in 1953. In the first two years, more than ten out of every hundred thermoses produced would explode, causing consumer dissatisfaction. Later, the factory workers worked hard to improve operating methods, adding thermocouple thermometers to the cooling furnace, drying furnace, and vacuum machine, which previously relied entirely on experience to control the temperature. They also established a system where every process, from raw material entry to finished product output, had to undergo strict inspection. Now the product quality has reached national standards, and the explosion rate has dropped from over ten percent in the past to two per thousand.

    Now, the production of Jianxiang brand thermoses has doubled compared to two years ago.

    建湘牌热水瓶质量提高
    据新华社讯　曾经被消费者称为“定时炸弹”的建湘牌热水瓶，现在已经被评为全国第一流产品了。这是六月间在全国热水瓶专业会议上评定的。
    建湘牌热水瓶，是长沙市公私合营建湘搪瓷热水瓶厂出产的。这个工厂是1953年建成的。头两年内出产的热水瓶，一百个中往往有十个以上发生爆炸，因此引起了消费者的不满。后来，这个厂的工人们努力改进操作方法，在过去全凭经验控制温度的冷却炉、风干炉、真空机上，添置了热电偶温度计，并且建立了从原料进厂到成品出厂，每一工序都要严格进行检验的制度。现在产品质量已经达到国家规定标准，爆炸率由过去百分之十几下降到千分之二。
    现在，建湘牌热水瓶的产量，已经比两年以前增加了两倍。
