Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, July 24th. The Second Agricultural Production Cooperative of Shuangshui Township, Xinhui County, Guangdong Province, has timely adjusted its contracted production targets because 80% of the cooperative's production teams were unable to complete their originally set targets despite an unusually bountiful early rice harvest.

This spring, when setting the contracted production targets, the cooperative relied solely on the temporary enthusiasm of a few cadres and put forward the slogan of a "thousand-斤 cooperative," demanding that this year's output of rice paddies across the cooperative increase from 658 *jin* per *mu* last year to 1,000 *jin*, with early rice production per *mu* increasing by 122%. At the time, many cooperative members said, "The target is so high, who can achieve it?"

Although cooperative members knew that the production increase target was too high, they still worked actively and achieved a bountiful early rice harvest, estimated to yield over 400 *jin* per *mu* for the entire cooperative, an increase of 85% compared to last year's early rice. Although the increase was substantial, it was still low compared to the original contracted production target. For example, seven out of nine production teams could not meet the target.

After seeing these circumstances, the cooperative cadres realized that the original contracted production target could no longer be maintained. They then mobilized the cooperative members to revise the contracted production target based on various factors, such as land quality, labor strength, last year's output, and fertilizer accumulation, as well as this year's early rice yield. After the adjustment, five production teams could receive overproduction bonuses after the early rice harvest, and two teams could also reach the target if they did careful harvesting and gleaning work. Only two teams could not complete it, and now the cooperative's leading cadres are actively helping them solve the problem.

Xinhua News Agency, Shantou, July 24th. The Yunguang Agricultural Cooperative in Jieyang County, Guangdong Province, led by Lin Yancheng, a national rice high-yield model, recently revised its production increase plan from this spring, which was launched in response to the challenge from Li Shunda and others, in conjunction with studying the issue of increasing the income of cooperative members.

The new production increase plan appropriately reduced the originally high rice production increase targets and expanded sideline production such as pig farming, duck raising, fish farming, and lime burning.

Based on the farmers' original habits of fishing and making drawnwork, Yunguang Cooperative's new production increase plan also stipulates that cooperative members should be given ample time during the slack farming season to engage in these household sideline occupations as much as possible. The entire cooperative strives to increase the income of more than 95% of the cooperative members, with the remainder not seeing a decrease in income.

Yunguang Cooperative's original production increase plan was formulated when it was a small cooperative of 37 households, requiring an average yield of 1,752 *jin* per *mu* for both early and late rice seasons. In March of this year, after the cooperative expanded into an advanced cooperative of 339 households, conditions such as land quality and cultivation techniques changed; at the same time, there was a lack of experience in managing the large cooperative. However, the cooperative committee underestimated the new difficulties and only saw the good side, and therefore did not promptly revise the overly high production increase plan. The result of the harvest of 892 *mu* of early rice in the entire cooperative was an average yield of 651 *jin* per *mu* (previously mistakenly reported as 696 *jin*), only completing 83.5% of the original plan. At the same time, the original plan did not pay enough attention to the development of sideline production.

After revising the production increase plan, the cooperative members actively invested in production. At present, the late rice transplanting work in the entire cooperative is nearly completed. The cooperative members, in accordance with the new production increase measures, have implemented single-seed close planting in 60% of the rice paddies, and small-seed close planting in the remainder.

    广东省两个农业生产合作社根据实际情况
    及时修订偏高的增产指标
    新华社广州24日电　广东省新会县双水乡第二农业生产合作社及时调整了包产指标，因为这个社有80％的生产队在少有的早稻丰收中却完不成原订的包产指标。
    今春，这个社订包产指标时，只凭几个干部的一时热情，就提出“千斤社”的口号，要今年全社每亩稻田的产量从去年的658斤增加到一千斤，早稻每亩则要增产122％。当时，许多社员就说：“指标那么高，有谁达得到？”
    虽然社员知道增产指标过高过大，但是社员们还是积极劳动，得到了早稻的丰收，估计全社每亩能收四百多斤，比去年早稻增产85％。增产已经很多了，但同原订的包产指标来比较还算低，例如，九个生产队中就有七个不能完成指标。
    社干看到这些情况后，知道原有的包产指标再不能维持下去了，便发动社员根据土地好坏、劳力强弱、去年的产量以及积肥和今年早稻产量等多方面的情况重新修订了包产指标。经过调整后，早稻丰收后，便有五个生产队可以得到超产奖励，两个队若做好细打细收工作也可以达到指标，仅有两个队完不成，现在社的领导干部正积极帮助他们解决。
    新华社汕头24日电　全国水稻丰产模范林炎城领导的广东省揭阳县云光农业社，最近结合研究增加社员收入的问题，修订了今年春天向李顺达等应战的增产计划。
    新的增产计划适当降低了原来偏高的水稻增产指标，扩大了养猪、养鸭、养鱼、烧石灰等副业生产。
    根据农民原有捕鱼和做抽纱的习惯，云光社的新增产计划还规定农闲时期尽量给予社员充裕的时间，去从事这些家庭副业。全社争取95％以上的社员增加收入，其余也不减少收入。
    云光社原来的增产计划是在三十七户的小社时制定的，早、晚两季水稻要求平均每亩收1，752斤。今年三月间，这个社扩大成为339户的高级社后，土地质量、耕作技术等条件都起了变化；同时，对大社的经营管理还缺乏经验。但是，社的委员对新的困难估计不足，只看到好的一面，因而没有及时修改偏高的增产计划。全社892亩早稻收获的结果，每亩平均产量为651斤（前误为696斤），只完成原定计划的83.5％。同时，原来的计划中对发展副业生产也注意不够。
    经过修订增产计划以后，社员们积极投入生产。目前，全社晚稻插秧工作已经接近完成。社员们按照新的增产措施，在60％的稻田里实行了单株密植，其余的都实行小株密植。
