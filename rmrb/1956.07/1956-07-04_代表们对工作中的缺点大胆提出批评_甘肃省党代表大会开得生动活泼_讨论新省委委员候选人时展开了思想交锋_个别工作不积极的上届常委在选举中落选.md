Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, 2nd - The Second Congress of the Communist Party of China in Gansu Province was held from June 21st to July 1st. The congress passed a resolution requiring party organizations and all party members throughout the province to continue to advance victoriously and strive to quickly build Gansu into a new industrial region of the motherland. The First Congress of the Communist Party of China in Gansu Province was held in August 1954. Since then, the face of Gansu Province has undergone new changes. The congress believes that the socialist transformation in the Gansu area has achieved a decisive victory. More than 70% of urban private industries in the province have implemented joint public-private ownership; the number of people participating in handicraft cooperatives has accounted for more than 80% of the total number of handicraft practitioners; as of the end of April this year, 91.54% of farmers in the province have joined agricultural producers' cooperatives, and farmers joining advanced cooperatives account for 31.6%. The province's industrial, mining, and transportation industries have also greatly developed. In the past two years, geological workers have continued to find coal mines, iron mines, and other metal mines in Gansu. Several large-scale factories and mines, such as oil refineries and petroleum machinery factories, have successively started the main construction or auxiliary construction. The Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway recently laid tracks to Yumen City. The Baotou-Lanzhou Railway will be built to Dijitai, 82 kilometers away from Lanzhou, this "August 1st". Construction of the Lanzhou-Xining Railway will commence in the fourth quarter of this year, and a railway network centered on Lanzhou is accelerating its formation. Since 1954, Gansu Province has become a province with surplus grain. This year's total grain output will reach 10.3 billion catties, an increase of 2.5 billion catties over last year, which can fulfill or exceed the targets set by the First Five-Year Plan. This year, 510,000 mu of cotton have been planted in the province, and the Hexi Corridor is becoming a new cotton-producing area with high yields.

This congress was held vigorously and lively. In group meetings and general assembly speeches, representatives made many criticisms of the shortcomings in various tasks, such as insufficient investigation and research, insufficient consideration of actual conditions, insufficient consultation with lower levels when making major decisions, insufficient consideration of the actual difficulties of lower levels, increasing institutions without increasing staffing, strict control of quotas, tight financial control, but many projects require local funding to be coordinated and resolved independently, trade institutions are divided too finely and specialized and lack mutual coordination, and many agricultural and sideline products cannot be organized for timely purchase, causing difficulties for farmers. These are the main problems currently existing in the work. The congress has proposed solutions to these problems.

The meeting believes that Gansu Province's future construction tasks are very arduous. Party organizations and all party members throughout the province must guard against arrogance and rashness, mobilize all positive factors, and work hard to build a new Gansu.

The congress elected 37 new provincial committee members, 10 alternate members, and 17 representatives to the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China. During the deliberation of candidates, the representatives engaged in ideological exchange and made frank criticisms of those party members who had shortcomings. Individual standing committee members of the previous term who were not active enough in their work failed to be elected.

Before the closing of the congress, 34 party organizations and 228 party members were commended. These party organizations and party members were selected from 304 organizations and 2,062 party members commended at the county (city) party congresses.

703 representatives attended the congress, representing more than 216,400 party members.

    新华社兰州2日电　中国共产党甘肃省第二次代表大会在六月二十一日到七月一日举行。大会作出决议，要求全省党组织和全体党员继续胜利前进，为把甘肃很快地建设成祖国一个新的工业地区而奋斗。中共甘肃省第一次代表大会是1954年8月间召开的，从那时以来，甘肃省的面貌又有了新的变化。这次代表大会认为，甘肃地区社会主义改造已经取得决定性的胜利，全省70％以上的城市私营工业实行了公私合营；参加手工业合作社的人数已占整个手工业从业人数的80％以上；截止今年四月底，全省已有91.54％的农户加入了农业生产合作社，加入高级社的农户占31.6％。全省的工矿交通事业也有了很大发展。地质工作人员近两年来继续在甘肃找到了煤矿、铁矿和其他金属矿，若干个规模巨大的厂矿，如炼油厂、石油机械厂等，已经先后开始了主体工程或附属工程建设。兰州—新疆铁路最近铺轨到玉门市，包头—兰州铁路今年“八一”将要修到距兰州八十二公里的狄家台，兰州—西宁铁路今年第四季度要动工建筑，以兰州为中心的铁路网正在加速形成中。自1954年开始，甘肃省已变成一个有余粮的省分，今年的粮食总产量将达到103亿斤，比去年增产二十五亿斤，可以完成或超额完成第一个五年计划规定的指标。今年全省棉花已播种了五十一万亩，河西走廊正在变成一个有高额产量的新的产棉区。
    这次代表大会开得生动活泼。在小组会和大会发言中，代表们对各项工作中的缺点提出了很多批评，例如对情况调查研究不够，从实际情况出发不够，决定重大问题和下边商议不够，对下边的实际困难照顾不够，增机构不增编制、名额控制很严，财政控制很死，但要地方费自行调剂解决的项目却很多，贸易机构分得过细过专又互相配合不够，许多农副产品不能及时组织收购，造成农民的困难，这些就是目前工作中存在的主要问题。对这些问题代表大会已提出了解决的办法。
    会议认为，甘肃省今后的建设任务是很繁重的，全省党组织和全体党员，必须戒骄戒躁，动员一切积极因素，为建设新甘肃而努力。
    代表大会选出了新的省委委员三十七人、候补委员十人和出席中共第八次代表大会的代表十七人。在酝酿候选人时，代表们展开了思想交锋，对那些有缺点的党员，提出了坦率的批评。个别工作不够积极的上届常委在选举中落选。
    代表大会闭幕前，表扬了三十四个党组织和228名党员。这些党组织和党员是从各县（市）党代表大会上表扬的304个组织和2，062名党员中选拔出来的。
    出席这次大会的代表有703人，代表着二十一万六千四百多名党员。
