A Tour of New Albania
Albanian Writer A. Qiachi

When I recall the past and see our people working with great enthusiasm for the happiness of our motherland, I cannot help but feel excited and moved. Why? Because in the country where I grew up, people used to scour every inch of land in search of work. Today, no one wanders the streets barefoot, starving. Everyone is fully employed, factories, institutions, and schools are being built everywhere, and highways and railways have become widespread.

Dear Chinese readers, let's take a quick tour of the new Albania together....

Let's start our journey from the capital, Tirana. All the factories I'm showing you were newly built after our liberation. The Stalin Textile Factory is our largest industrial enterprise, with an annual production capacity of 21 million meters of textiles. In the past, we had no textile industry. Everything had to be imported from abroad, and we were forced to work for foreigners. In Tirana, six universities have now been established for the first time. The children of our people study there to cultivate themselves into people who are beneficial to the people. The first group of cadres with domestic higher education has already been trained. In the future, hundreds of engineers, agronomists, doctors, and teachers will graduate from these schools every year. In Tirana, we have also built a People's Theater for the first time, which regularly stages various dramas, operas, and song and dance dramas. A porcelain factory, a printing house named after the Albanian poet N. Frashëri of the Renaissance era, scientific research institutes, writers' associations and artists' associations, nurseries and kindergartens have also been newly built one after another. Tirana has many gardens and parks full of flowers, where children sing and play, and residents take walks and rest. Our Tirana has become a beautiful capital. It brings infinite joy to those who have seen it before the war, during the national liberation struggle, and today.

There are other factories in Tirana, but now let's go to Shkodër, a beautiful city in northern Albania. Along the way, we see the fields that already belong to agricultural producers' cooperatives and the tractors roaring in the fields. A few hours later, we arrived in Shkodër. A tobacco factory has been built here, because a large part of Albania's tobacco grows in this area. Irrigation canals have also been dug, such as the Koplik Canal and the Postriba Canal, which are used to irrigate tobacco crops.

When returning from Shkodër, we travel along the left side of the road. The construction project of the "Enver Hoxha" Hydropower Station on the Mati River is underway, and the electricity it generates in the future will illuminate most parts of our country. After reaching the city of Vora, the midpoint from Tirana to the port of Durrës, we boarded the train. In the past, our country did not have a single railway. It was only after liberation that the people's government built the two railway lines of Tirana-Durrës and Durrës-Elbasan. Soon, we arrived by train at the coast of Durrës. Here, on April 7, 1939, the Italian fascists who attempted to invade our country were met with armed resistance from our people. Today, the blue waters of the Adriatic Sea are freely surging and roaring. Thousands of our workers and staff come here to the seaside to spend their summer vacations and enjoy a happy life.

We came to a place called Rrogozhinë by train. It used to be very desolate here. But now it is full of vitality. As soon as the train arrives here, hundreds of farmers and nearby residents board the train. A cotton ginning factory and a soap factory have been established here. Those who have been to this place before can no longer recognize it today.

The journey to Elbasan, the central city of Albania, is not too far. The appearance of this city surrounded by mountains has also been completely renewed. There is a large-scale wood processing complex here. Its plywood and other finished products are supplied to our construction enterprises and residences. In the suburbs of Elbasan, an oil refinery is under construction. This is another large factory in our country being built with the friendly assistance of the Soviet Union.

Before reaching Korçë, a famous city in southern Albania, one must pass through the beautiful town of Pogradec on the shores of Lake Ohrid. Workers and staff also often come here for vacation. Further south from here, near Korçë, there is a town called Maliq. What a big change here! The large swamp that used to be a source of malaria no longer exists. The fertile virgin land has been plowed, and huge agricultural enterprises have been established on more than 4,000 hectares of land. In Korçë, a new glass manufacturing plant has begun to produce various glass products for residents. It also produces beer that supplies the entire Albania. Before the war, beer was a luxury, but now it is widely consumed. There is also a knitting factory here, which also produces shoes, boots, and other clothing items. Korçë once fought courageously and movingly with all kinds of enemies for the liberation of Albania. Today, it has become an important cultural center in our country. The face of Korçë is changing with each passing day.

Before reaching Gjirokastër, one must pass through several areas along the southern border of Albania. This area is full of towering mountains, which in the past and during the national liberation struggle, have become the base of freedom fighters. Gjirokastër is an ancient town located on a hillside. The recently built hospital here has added a lot of color to it. A small factory has also been built here, and hundreds of young men and women graduate from the middle school here every year. Some of them go to domestic higher education institutions, and some go to the Soviet Union and people's democratic countries for further studies.

Crossing the mountains and fields from Gjirokastër, we arrive at Sarandë, a beautiful city on the Ionian Sea. Along the coast, we continue our journey to a place called Himarë. Orange trees, lemon trees, olive trees, and grape vines grow everywhere here. People feel refreshed when they come here. This place has been aptly called the "Albanian Riviera" (note: the Riviera is a famous winter resort between France and Italy). Any foreigner passing through here must stay to admire its wonderful scenery.

Our car speeds along the hillside road. A few hours later, we arrived at Vlora, another important city in our country. Tremendous changes have also taken place here. In the past, this city was neglected by the ruling class, but now it has become an industrial hub. In Vlora, there is a rice mill, and the Lenin Cement Factory with an annual output of more than 40,000 tons of cement. Its products are used to build factories and residences. There is also a tannery, and a fishing and canning factory is also nearing completion.

From Vlora we arrived at the small town of Fier, where another cotton ginning factory has been established. Like some other towns, there are many agricultural producers' cooperatives in this area. It is very interesting to stay here for a while to see the changes taking place in the countryside. In the past, feudal landlords squeezed the blood and sweat of the people. To know this well, it is enough to mention the words of the 140-year-old man Yani Lipri. He said one day: "The suffering we suffered in the past is truly unspeakable. My chest (he pressed his chest with his hand) is weakened because I always bowed to the officials like a slave. At that time, when I saw the feudal rulers, I had to crawl on the ground and press my chest with my right hand." Now life here has changed 100 percent. Thatched cottages have been replaced by new houses, and people's faces have become rosy. Their complexion reflects the new life in the Albanian countryside.

Dear readers, let's stop here. My motherland is a small country with a total population of about 1.4 million people. The factories mentioned above, which were built in a very short period of time, are not small for our country. We have obtained all of this with the help of the Soviet Union, the people's democratic countries, and the Chinese people. We are very grateful for this fraternal assistance.

In our work of building socialism, we completed the first five-year plan last year. As a result of the completion of this plan, our country has transformed from a backward agricultural country into an agricultural-industrial country. The first five-year plan brought a new industry to our country: many factories, workshops, and power stations.

The Third Congress of the Albanian Labor Party recently approved the draft guidelines for the second five-year plan for the development of our national economy. According to the provisions of this plan, the total industrial output value will increase by 91%, with an average annual growth rate of 13.8%. More than 70% of the arable land in rural areas will be collectivized. The second five-year plan will further strengthen our people's democracy, consolidate our motherland, improve the lives of our people, and open up new great prospects for the development of our country. Our country is advancing on the road to building socialism. On this road, we have received comprehensive and selfless assistance from the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries.

    新阿尔巴尼亚巡礼
    阿尔巴尼亚作家　阿·恰奇
    当我回忆过去、而同时又看到我国人民现在以巨大的热情为祖国的幸福而劳动的时候，我总是抑制不住自己的兴奋和激动。为什么呢？因为在我所生长的这个国家里，从前人们曾经踏遍了每一寸土地去谋求职业。而今天，再也没有人赤着双足踯躅街头、忍饥挨饿了。大家都已充分就业，工厂、机关、学校到处都在兴建起来，公路和铁路已经四通八达了。
    亲爱的中国读者，现在让我们一起来对新的阿尔巴尼亚作一番快速的巡礼吧……。
    我们先从首都地拉那开始我们的行程。所有我指给你们看的这些工厂都是在我国解放以后新建设起来的。斯大林纺织工厂是我国最大的工业企业，它的年产能力是二千一百万公尺纺织品。过去我们没有纺织工业。什么都得从外国进口，而我们又都被迫为外国人干活。在地拉那，现在第一次建立了六所高等学校。我国人民的子女在那里学习，为了把自己培养成为有益于人民的人。最初的一批受过本国高等教育的干部已经培养出来。以后每年都要有几百个工程师、农学家、医师、教员从这些学校毕业。在地拉那，我们还第一次新建了一座人民剧院，经常上演各种戏剧、歌剧和歌舞剧。一个磁器工厂，一个以文艺复兴时代的阿尔巴尼亚诗人纳·佛拉西里命名的印刷所，科学研究所，作家协会和艺术家协会，托儿所和幼儿园也都一个接着一个新建起来了。地拉那有许多鲜花盛开的花园和公园，在那里孩子们唱歌游戏，居民们散步休息。我们的地拉那已成为一个美丽的首都。它使那些曾经在战前、在民族解放斗争期间和在今天看到它的人们感到无限的喜悦。
    在地拉那还有另外一些工厂，但是现在让我们前往阿尔巴尼亚北部的一个美丽城市斯库台去吧。一路上我们看到那些已经属于农业生产合作社的田野和在田野上隆隆作响的拖拉机。几个小时以后，我们来到了斯库台。这里已经建成了一个烟草工厂，因为阿尔巴尼亚有很大一部分烟草是生长在这一带的。灌溉水渠也已开凿了，如科泼立克水渠和波斯特里巴水渠已经用来灌溉烟草作物。
    在从斯库台回来的时候，我们沿着公路的左边行进。麦蒂河上的“恩维尔·霍查”水电站建筑工程正在进行，将来它所发出的电力将使我国大部分地区得到照明。在到达从地拉那到都拉斯港的中点伏拉城以后，我们搭上了火车。过去我国是没有一寸铁路的。只是在解放以后，人民政权才修建了地拉那—都拉斯和都拉斯—爱尔巴桑的两条铁路线。过不久，我们就坐火车到达了都拉斯的海岸。在这里，1939年4月7日企图侵占我国的意大利法西斯曾遭到我国人民的武装抗击。今天亚得里亚海的蓝色的海水正在自由地奔腾呼啸。几千个我国工人和职员都来到这里的海滨度夏天的假期，享受幸福的生活。
    坐着火车，我们来到了一个名叫罗哥吉纳的地方。这里从前是很荒凉的。但是现在已经是生气勃勃了。火车一到这里，就有好几百个农民和附近居民搭上车来。这里已建立了一个轧棉工厂和一个肥皂工厂。那些从前曾经到过这个地方的人，今天已经认不出它来了。
    到阿尔巴尼亚的中心城市爱尔巴桑的路程并不太远。这个山峦环抱的城市的面貌也焕然一新了。这里有一个规模很大的木材加工联合厂。它所出产的夹板和其他成品，供应我们建筑企业和住宅。在爱尔巴桑的近郊，有一个炼油厂正在建设中。这是在苏联友好帮助下建设的我国另一个大工厂。
    在到达阿尔巴尼亚南部的名城科尔察之前，人们得经过奥赫里湖畔的美丽的小城波格拉得茨。工人和职员也常常到这里来休假。离此往南，将近科尔察的地方，有个小镇叫马利基。这里的变化是多么大啊！从前成为疟疾源泉的大沼泽地早已不存在了。肥沃的处女地经过了翻耕，巨大的农业企业已在四千多公顷的土地上建立起来。在科尔察，一个新的玻璃制造厂已经开始出产各种玻璃品供应居民。这里还出产供应阿尔巴尼亚全国的啤酒。战前啤酒是一种奢侈品，现在则已被普遍饮用了。这里还有一个针织厂，同时还出产鞋靴和其他衣着什物。科尔察曾经为了阿尔巴尼亚的解放而同各种各样的敌人进行过可歌可泣的英勇战斗，今天它已成为我国的一个重要的文化中心了。科尔察的面貌正在日新月异地发生变化。
    要到阿其洛卡斯特罗之前，人们必须沿着阿尔巴尼亚的南部边界经过几个地区。这一带都是崇山峻岭，在过去和在民族解放斗争期间，都曾成为自由战士们的根据地，阿其洛卡斯特罗是座落在山坡上的一个古老的城镇。最近在这里盖的一所医院使它增色不少。这里还兴建了一个小工厂，每年有几百个少年男女从这里的中等学校中毕业出来。他们有的到本国的高等教育机关，有的到苏联和人民民主国家中去继续深造。
    从阿其洛卡斯特罗越过高山和田野，我们到达了沙兰达，这是一个位在爱奥尼亚海畔的风光秀丽的城市，沿着海岸，我们继续行程到了名叫希玛拉的地方。这里到处都生长着桔子树、柠檬树、橄榄树和葡萄藤。人们到了这里都会感到心旷神怡。这个地方曾被恰当地称为“阿尔巴尼亚的里维拉”（按里维拉为法国和意大利之间一个著名的避寒胜地）。任何一个外国人经过这里都要逗留下来欣赏一下它的美妙的胜景。
    我们的汽车在山坡公路上急驰。几个钟头以后我们到达了我国的另一个重要城市发罗那。这里也发生了巨大的变化。过去这个城市曾被统治阶级忽视过，现在它已成为一个工业重地了，在发罗那有一个碾米工厂，一个年产四万多吨水泥的列宁水泥工厂。它的产品被用来建筑工厂和住宅。还有一个制革厂，同时，一个渔业和罐头工厂也已接近完工。
    从发罗那我们抵达小城费也里，这里已建立了另一个清棉工厂。像其他的一些城镇一样，这一带有许多农业生产合作社。在这里逗留片刻来看看农村中发生的变化是很有意思的。过去，封建地主榨取着人民的血汗。要很好地知道这一点，只需提一下一百四十岁老人雅尼·力普里讲的话就够了。他有一天说：“我们过去受的苦真是一言难尽。我这个胸（他用手按着自己的胸口）因为老是向官吏奴隶般地卑躬屈膝而虚弱了。当时见到封建统治者的时候必须匍伏在地并以右手按住胸头。”现在这里的生活已经百分之一百地变样了。茅屋已被新的住房所代替，人们的面孔上已经显出红润。他们的脸色就反映出了阿尔巴尼亚农村中的新生活。
    亲爱的读者，到这里我们就停下来了。我的祖国是一个小国家，它一共只有大约一百四十万人口。上面所说的那些在非常短的期间内建立起来的工厂，对我国来说，是不小的了。所有这些，我们都得到了苏联和人民民主国家以及中国人民的帮助。我们十分感谢这些兄弟般的援助。
    在我们建设社会主义的工作中，我们已经在去年完成了第一个五年计划。由于这个计划的完成，我国已从一个落后的农业国家转变成为一个农业—工业国。第一个五年计划给我国带来了一个新的工业：许多工厂、作坊和发电站。
    阿尔巴尼亚劳动党第三次代表大会最近又通过了我国发展国民经济的第二个五年计划的指示草案。根据这个计划的规定，工业总产值将增加91％，每年平均增长速度为13.8％。农村中70％以上的耕地将实行合作化。第二个五年计划将进一步加强我们的人民民主，巩固我们的祖国，改善我国人民的生活，为我国的发展开辟新的伟大的远景。我国正在建设社会主义的道路上前进，在这条道路上，我们得到了苏联和人民民主国家的全面的无私的援助。
