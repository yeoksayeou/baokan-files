Xinhua News Agency, July 24th: The State Council issued an emergency notice on July 20th, requiring the People's Committees of all provinces, autonomous regions, and directly administered municipalities, as well as all industrial departments, to promptly take measures to carry out heatstroke prevention and cooling work.

The notice stated: Since the beginning of summer this year, the climate in the Jiangnan area has been particularly hot, with some areas even breaking the highest temperatures in a century. In addition, some enterprises and units did not make adequate preparations for heatstroke prevention and cooling before the arrival of summer, resulting in many cases of heatstroke among workers. In order to prevent the continued occurrence of heatstroke incidents, it is hoped that all relevant regions will quickly study and adopt the following measures:

1. Industrial cities with particularly hot climates should promptly organize relevant units to establish specialized heatstroke prevention and cooling agencies to supervise enterprises in strengthening heatstroke prevention and cooling work.

2. Adjust or shorten the working hours of workers in high-temperature workshops and outdoor operations, increase intermediate rest periods, and change work to early morning and evening shifts as much as possible. In enterprises where heatstroke among workers is serious, the workshop temperature is too high, and there are no appropriate cooling measures, temporary suspension of production may be considered.

3. Strictly limit overtime work; overtime work is prohibited during high-temperature periods. Temporarily suspend some or all extracurricular activities to ensure workers' rest during their leisure time.

4. Fully utilize the effectiveness of existing cooling equipment. Enterprises that have not yet completed their original cooling measures plan should complete it quickly. Those without appropriate cooling measures should take measures as soon as possible, and should take some temporary measures such as building shelters to reduce the temperature of the factory buildings as much as possible.

5. Increase the supply of cooling beverages and heatstroke prevention medicines, and pay attention to strengthening routine health care work.

    国务院发出防暑降温紧急通知
    新华社24日讯　国务院在七月二十日发出紧急通知，要各省、自治区、直辖市人民委员会、各产业部，迅速采取措施，进行防暑降温工作。
    通知说：今年入夏以来，江南一带气候特别炎热，有的地区甚至突破了百年来的最高气温，加上有些企业单位在夏季到来以前还没有把防暑降温准备工作做好，以致工人中暑事故很多。为了防止中暑事故的继续发生，希望各有关地区迅速研究采取以下措施：
    1．气候特别炎热的工业城市，应该迅速组织有关单位成立防暑降温的专门机构，督促各企业加强防暑降温工作。
    2．调整或者缩短高温车间和露天作业工人的工作时间，增加中间的休息时间，尽可能地改为早晚作业；在工人中暑现象严重、车间温度过高而又没有适当降温措施的企业，可以考虑暂时停止生产。
    3．严格限制加班加点，高温期内禁止加班加点。暂时停止一部分或全部的业余活动，以保证工人在业余时间的休息。
    4．充分发挥现有降温设备的效能，企业中原订降温措施计划还没有完成的，应该迅速完成；没有适当降温措施的，应该尽快地采取措施，并且应该尽可能地采取一些临时措施如搭设凉棚等，以降低厂房的温度。
    5．增加清凉饮料、防暑药品的供应，并且注意加强经常性的卫生保健工作。
