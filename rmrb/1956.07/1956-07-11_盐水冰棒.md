    Salted Ice Pops
    (Our dispatch) Every morning, as the workers of the Shanghai Asia Steel Factory are working hard, the factory's trucks transport salted ice pops from the Yimin Food Factory No. 3 and load them into large refrigerators. At ten o'clock, the ice pops are distributed to the workers. Workers in high-temperature workshops receive four free ice pops per person per day, and ordinary workers receive two per person per day.
    Steelworkers stand next to scorching steelmaking furnaces all day, and a large amount of salt in their bodies evaporates with sweat, making them prone to heatstroke. This year, Shanghai Yimin Food Factory No. 3 has specially produced salted ice pops for workers in high-temperature workshops. These ice pops contain 1.5% salt, which can replenish the salt and water lost by workers due to sweating and lower their body temperature. More than a dozen factories are now buying these ice pops in large quantities every day for their workers to eat.

    盐水冰棒
    本报讯　每天上午，当上海亚细亚钢铁厂的工人们紧张地工作着的时候，厂里的大卡车就从益民食品三厂运来了盐水冰棒，装进了大冰箱。十点钟，开始给工人们发冰棒。高温车间的工人每人每天免费领取四支，普通工人每人每天领两支。
    钢铁工人整天站在炽热的炼钢炉旁，身体里的大量盐份随着汗水蒸发出来，容易中暑。上海益民食品三厂今年特地为高温车间工人生产了盐水冰棒，这种冰棒里含有1.5％的盐份，既可以补充工人因流汗而失去的盐份和水份，又可以降低体温。现在有十多个工厂每天都大量购买这种冰棒给工人食用。
