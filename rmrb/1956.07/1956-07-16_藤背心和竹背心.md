    Rattan and Bamboo Vests

    Recently, some workers in Shanghai who work in high-temperature environments have started wearing rattan and bamboo vests woven for them by handicraftsmen.

    Both types of vests are of the Chinese-style, button-up type, with ventilating mesh all over, like tulle. The rattan vests are woven from rattan threads that are almost as thin as琴弦 (qín xián, the strings of a zither), and each weighs only a little over three taels (approximately 112.5 grams). The bamboo vests are made of strips of moso bamboo, and are equally light and smooth. Wearing these vests separates the workers' skin from their work clothes, preventing sweat from soaking the clothing and making it stick to the body. Workers in the boiler room of the state-owned Shanghai No. 1 Printing and Dyeing Factory are now wearing rattan vests while working, and find it cooler than before.

    These two types of vests are woven by the Shanghai Guoxin Rattan and Willow Products and the Ninth Bamboo Utensils Handicraft Production Cooperatives. Now, many hardware, foundry, enamel, wire, papermaking, and other factories are placing orders with them. (Xinhua News Agency)

    藤背心和竹背心
    上海市有些高温作业的工人，最近穿上了手工业者为他们编制的藤背心和竹背心。
    这两种背心都是对襟式的，像珠罗纱一样满布透风的网眼。藤背心是用和琴弦差不多细的藤丝编成，每件只有三两多重；竹背心用的是篾竹的竹枝，也同样轻盈光滑。穿上这两种背心，能使工人的肌肤和工作衣隔开，衣衫不会让汗水渗透，贴在身上。国营上海第一印染厂锅炉间的工人现在穿着藤背心操作，感到比以前凉快。
    编制这两种背心的是上海国新藤柳制品和第九竹器两个手工业生产合作社。现在，许多五金、翻砂、搪瓷、电线、造纸等工厂正纷纷向他们订购。　（新华社）
