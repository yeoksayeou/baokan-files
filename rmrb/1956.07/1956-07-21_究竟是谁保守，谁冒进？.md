Who Exactly is Conservative, and Who is Impetuous?

    This year, for the first time, the Wusha Agricultural Production Cooperative in Wusha District, Xingyi County, Guizhou Province, interplanted a crop of early corn in the summer harvest fields. When drafting the production plan, some cooperative members and cadres were doubtful. They said: The fields are already planted with wheat, beans, etc. It might not be safe to plant early corn for another hundred days. Because after the wheat and beans grow, the early corn will have difficulty absorbing sunlight and nutrients; in addition, the local soil is cold, which will affect the growth of the early corn. Based on everyone's opinions, the cooperative's cadres decided to first try planting 500 mu on sloping and mountainous land. However, the district's working cadres, fearing being labeled "right-leaning conservative," repeatedly criticized the cooperative's cadres for being "too conservative" and insisted that they plant 2,000 mu. The cooperative cadres reluctantly accepted the numbers assigned by the higher-ups.

    The land was planted according to the orders from above, but what was the result? By the end of May, the early corn planted on the hillsides grew relatively well, but a lot of the 1,350 mu of early corn planted in the summer harvest fields did not sprout, and the cooperative members had to replant two or three times. These corn plants, which had grown to be only a foot tall, developed "smallpox." According to estimates by cooperative cadres and members, these corn plants will only yield 20% of the planned output.

    This season of corn required more than 1.75 million jin of fertilizer, more than 10,000 jin of seeds, and consumed more than 4,050 labor days. As a result, there was not enough fertilizer left for transplanting rice seedlings, planting flue-cured tobacco, and planting the second season of corn.

    Do the masses have right-leaning conservative ideas? Or do these district cadres have an impatient and impetuous attitude? The facts have already drawn a conclusion. This incident once again tells us: In reforming the farming system, failure to conduct investigation and research, failure to follow the principle of adapting to local conditions, and failure to listen to the opinions of the masses will cause great losses! The rural work cadres of Wusha District should examine their work style and learn from this lesson.

### 究竟是谁保守，谁冒进？

    究竟是谁保守，谁冒进？
    贵州省兴义县乌沙区乌沙农业生产合作社，今年第一次在夏收作物田里间种了一季早玉米。在订生产计划的时候，部分社员和社干部就有些怀疑，他们说：地里已经种上了麦子、豆子等，如果再种百天早玉米恐怕不保险。因为麦子、豆子长大后，早玉米难以吸收阳光和养分；另外，当地土壤较冷，会影响早玉米的成长。根据大家意见，合作社的干部决定先在偏坡和山夹地先试种五百亩。但是，区的工作干部们怕戴上“右倾保守”的帽子，也就再三批评社干部“太保守”，硬要他们社种植二千亩。社干部勉强地把上级分配的数字接受下来。
    地是按照上面的命令种上了，可是，结果怎样呢？到五月底，种在山坡上的早玉米生长的较好，但种在夏收作物地里的一千三百五十亩早玉米，好多没有出苗，社员们不得不补种两三次。这些玉米都长到一尺多高就生“天花”了。据社干部和社员们估计，这些玉米只能收到计划产量的20％。
    这一季玉米共投放了肥料175万多斤、种子一万多斤，花费劳动日4，050多个。这样，插稻秧、种烤烟和种二季玉米所需要的肥料反倒不够了。
    究竟是群众有右倾保守思想呢？还是这些区干部有急躁冒进情绪呢？事实已经作了结论。这件事再一次告诉我们：在改革耕作制度中，不作调查研究，不遵循因地制宜的原则，又不听取群众的意见，会造成多么大的损失！乌沙区的农村工作干部应当检查一下自己的作风，吸取这一教训。
