Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, July 4th: "The motherland has opened its doors, hoping that the Taiwan authorities will send representatives to discuss the specific steps and conditions for the peaceful liberation of Taiwan. I have read Premier Zhou's speech several times and written down many things I want to say to the Taiwan authorities. I must persuade Chiang Kai-shek to abandon his dream of restoration on the mainland and send representatives to Beijing to negotiate." This was said by Jia Yibin, a former Kuomintang general who revolted and is now a member of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), at a symposium held yesterday by the CPPCC Shanghai Municipal Committee.

Also speaking at the symposium were former Kuomintang military and political personnel Li Er'kang, Wang Puhan, Fan Songfu, Zheng Ruogu, Zhang Xiang, Zhou Bomin, Xiao Juetian, Ouyang Jingxiu, Zhang Silin, Xue Dubi, and Huo Xixiang. They all urged the Kuomintang military and political personnel in Taiwan to break free from American control, choose the path of patriotism, and perform meritorious service for the peaceful liberation of Taiwan.

Fan Songfu, former Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the 34th Army Group of the Kuomintang who remained on the mainland after liberation and is now a member of the CPPCC Shanghai Municipal Committee, said: If the Chiang Kai-shek group does not accept this proposal and relies on the United States, not only is it unreliable to prolong its existence, but it will also have no place to be buried. He said that we should join hands to unite against foreign aggressors. Zheng Ruogu, former Kuomintang legislator, said that this is the best opportunity for the Chiang Kai-shek group. The Taiwan issue is our internal affair and should be handled by the Chinese themselves. Zhang Xiang, former Chief of Staff of the Kuomintang 19th Route Army and a member of the CPPCC Shanghai Municipal Committee, said: Anyone in Taiwan with a little conscience should take the path of patriotism for their own interests and future and perform meritorious service for the peaceful liberation of Taiwan.

Wang Puhan, former Kuomintang legislator and member of the CPPCC Shanghai Municipal Committee, who recently returned from Taiwan via Hong Kong, said: For all patriots, regardless of when they joined the patriotic ranks or how many mistakes they made in the past, the People's Government adopts the attitude of not investigating the past and giving them the opportunity to perform meritorious service. He said that he welcomes friends in Taiwan and overseas to return to the mainland to visit, see relatives, and meet friends.

Xue Dubi, former Kuomintang legislator and member of the National Committee of the CPPCC, said that he would use radio broadcasts to advise his old friends in Taiwan to take action and strive for the early peaceful liberation of Taiwan. Zhou Bomin, former Kuomintang legislator and member of the CPPCC Shanghai Municipal Committee, also said that he would do his best to realize the hope of the people of the motherland for the peaceful liberation of Taiwan.

    在上海的前国民党军政人员座谈台湾问题
    忠告台湾当局接受和谈建议
    新华社上海4日电　“祖国敞开大门，希望台湾当局派遣代表前来商谈和平解放台湾的具体步骤和条件。我已经读了好几遍周总理的发言，写下了许多我要向台湾当局说的话，我无论如何要规劝蒋介石赶紧抛弃在大陆复辟的梦想，派代表到北京来商谈。”这是起义将领、政协上海市委员会委员贾亦斌在政协上海市委员会昨天举行的座谈会上说的。
    在座谈会上发言的，还有前国民党军政人员厉尔康、王普涵、樊崧甫、郑若谷、张襄、周伯敏、萧觉天、欧阳景修、张斯麟、薛笃弼、霍锡祥等人。他们都忠告台湾的国民党军政人员摆脱美国控制，选择爱国的道路，为和平解放台湾立功。
    解放时留在大陆的前国民党三十四集团军副总司令、政协上海市委员会委员樊崧甫说：如果蒋介石集团不接受这个建议，依赖美国，不仅苟延残喘不可靠，而且将死无葬身之地。他说，我们应当携起手来一致对外，反对外国侵略者。前国民党立法委员郑若谷说，这是蒋介石集团最好的机会。台湾问题是我们内部的事情，应当由中国人自己来处理。前国民党十九路军参谋长、政协上海市委员会委员张襄说：在台湾的只要稍有良心的人，为了自身的利益和前途，都应当走爱国的道路，为和平解放台湾立功。
    不久前从台湾经香港归来的前国民党立法委员、政协上海市委员会委员王普涵说：对于一切爱国的人，不论他们参加爱国行列先后，也不论他们过去犯过多大罪过，人民政府都采取既往不究的态度，给予立功的机会。他说，欢迎台湾和海外的朋友们，回到大陆来参观和省亲会友。
    前国民党立法委员、政协全国委员会委员薛笃弼表示要通过广播，忠告他在台湾的老朋友们行动起来，争取早日和平解放台湾。前国民党立法委员、政协上海市委员会委员周伯敏也表示要尽最大的努力来实现祖国人民和平解放台湾的期望。
