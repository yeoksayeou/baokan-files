Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, July 2nd. From yesterday, the 240 hydrological and meteorological stations distributed along the Yellow River's main stream and its tributaries, from Guide in Qinghai Province in the west to Lijin at the Yellow River's mouth in Shandong Province in the east, began comprehensive flood reporting.

Although yesterday was Sunday, the Yellow River Flood Control Headquarters' Hydrological Situation Group was busier than usual. Couriers delivering telegrams shuttled between the Telecommunications Group and the Hydrological Situation Group, bringing brief telegrams containing hydrological or rainfall data from various stations. Hydrological staff also used the special Yellow River flood control telephone line, stretching thousands of miles, to transmit hydrological and meteorological information to downstream stations, or directly inquire about hydrological and meteorological situations from upstream stations. Hydrological staff made flood forecasts based on rainfall reports, and constantly revised the curves of water level and flow forecasts based on reports from various stations. The entire flood reporting network in the Yellow River basin formed a very flexible organic whole, becoming indispensable eyes and ears for the lower reaches of the Yellow River.

Flood reporting in the Yellow River basin usually starts on July 1st every year. This year, based on the characteristics of an early rainy season, abundant rainfall, and early flood season, the Yellow River basin started flood reporting early on June 8th. However, only a portion of the basic hydrological control stations reported floods in June. Now, according to the annual pattern of the "fuqiu" (dog days and autumn) and major flood season, today the flood reporting will switch from basic hydrological control stations to comprehensive flood reporting by hydrological, water level, and rainfall measurement stations throughout the Yellow River basin.

### 西起青海贵德东到山东利津  黄河开始全面发报汛情

    西起青海贵德东到山东利津
    黄河开始全面发报汛情
    新华社郑州2日电　从昨天起，黄河流域上起青海省的贵德，下到山东省利津黄河入海处，分布在黄河干流及其支流上的二百四十个水文、气象测站开始了全面报汛。
    昨天虽然是星期日，黄河防汛总指挥部的水情组却比往日还忙碌。传递电报的通讯员穿梭似的把来自各测站的水文或雨量等简要电报从电讯组送到水情组；水情工作人员也利用几千里长的治黄专用电话线向下游各站传达水文、气象情况，或向上游各站直接询问水文、气象情况；水文工作人员根据雨情报告，做了洪水预报，又根据各站的报告，随时修正水位和流量预报的曲线图。整个黄河流域测报汛情联络网，组成了一个非常灵活的有机体，它们成了黄河下游不可少的耳目。
    黄河流域的报汛，每年都是从七月一日开始。今年根据雨季到来早，雨水多，提前入汛的特点，黄河流域在六月八日就提前报汛了。不过六月份报汛的，仅是一部分基本水文控制站。现在根据每年伏秋、大汛的规律，今天由基本水文控制站报汛转为黄河流域水文、水位、雨量等测站的全面报汛。
