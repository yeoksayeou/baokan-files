    On First Love and Shyness
    Liang Da

    "Young men and women in first love always want to stay by their beloved's side a little longer, to look at them a few more times."
    This is the opening sentence written by reporter Fengsha of the Huangshi Workers' Daily in a news report. After reading this sentence, it's hard to imagine that the reporter is writing about "A Visit to the Soviet Exhibition in Wuhan." It turns out that he wanted to use this sentence to describe the farmers visiting the Soviet exhibition, standing in front of agricultural machinery, "also like this: looking and looking, loving it more and more, simply reluctant to leave."
    The result is the construction of the following picture: the farmers are looking at agricultural machinery, reluctant to leave; the reporter is watching the farmers looking at agricultural machinery, and thinking of young men and women looking at their beloved, and even "young men and women in first love."
    This type of description can often be seen. The following is a passage from a feature article by Wen Jie published in the "People's Daily":
    "You didn't speak, but lowered your head slightly, half-closing your eyes. At this time, I saw that your eyelashes were so long, like two rows of extended flower stamens. From the shyness unique to your young girl's posture, I could feel that you were filled with yearning and joy for future happiness."
    This time, it really seems like it's writing about young men and women in first love, and it even seems like a scene of courtship. Look, first she "lowered her head slightly," then she "half-closed her eyes," followed by a "shy posture," and finally "filled with yearning and joy for future happiness."
    However, it's wrong. Wen Jie's feature article is about the advanced producer, female textile worker Bushare. From the entire article, Bushare's "yearning and joy for future happiness" refers to the happiness of labor, the happiness of a bright future.
    How can farmers looking at agricultural machinery be like "young men and women in first love"? It's also not easy for a young female worker's yearning and joy for the happiness of labor and a bright future to "lower her head slightly," "half-close her eyes," and have a "shy" posture. Even if they really "lower their head slightly," "half-close their eyes," and have a "shy" posture, it doesn't seem necessary to describe it in an article with this theme.
    I am not advocating dryness or formulaic writing. We should also respect every author's use of their own methods to describe a character. However, if we indiscriminately use words like "first love" and "shyness" to describe everything, as if only first love and shyness are the most touching words and the most beautiful emotions, then it's not entirely appropriate. Inappropriate descriptions will bring a sense of unreality to the reader.

    初恋和羞涩之类
    梁达
    “初恋的年青男女碰到一起，总想在爱侣身旁多呆一会，多看几眼。”
    这是黄石市工人报记者风砂写在一篇通讯里开头的一句话。读了这句话，简直想不到记者写的是“武汉苏联展览会参观记”。原来他是想借这句话，来描写参观苏联展览会的农民们，站在农业机械面前，“也是这样：看了又看，越看越爱，简直舍不得离开”。
    结果却构造成这么一幅图画：农民们在看农业机械，舍不得离开；记者在看农民们看农业机械，就想到年青的男女在看爱侣，而且还是“初恋的年青男女”。
    像这类描写常常可以看到。下面是登在“人民日报”上的闻捷的一篇特写中的一段：
    “你没有讲话，却微微地低下头，半闭起眼睛。这时，我才看到你的睫毛是那样的长，仿佛两排伸展的花蕊一般。从你那少女所特有的羞涩姿态里，我感觉得出，你胸中激荡着对于未来幸福的向往和欢乐。”
    这回，倒真像写的是初恋的年青男女，而且似乎还是求爱之类的场面了。你看，先是“微微地低下头”，随后是“半闭起眼睛”，继而是“羞涩姿态”，最后是“胸中激荡着对于未来幸福的向往和欢乐”。
    然而，错了。闻捷的这篇特写写的是先进生产者纺织女工布沙热。从全篇文章看来，所写的布沙热“对于未来幸福的向往和欢乐”，指的是劳动的幸福、前程远大的幸福。
    农民看农业机械怎么会像“初恋的年青男女”？年轻女工对于劳动的幸福、前程远大的幸福的向往和欢乐，也是不大容易“微微地低下头”、“半闭起眼睛”和姿态“羞涩”的，即便真的“微微地低下头”、“半闭起眼睛”和姿态“羞涩”，好像也没有必要在这样一篇主题的文章里描写。
    我并不是在提倡枯燥，提倡公式化。我们也应该尊重每一个作者运用他自己的手法去描写一个人物。但是，如果不择事，不择人，一概用上“初恋”和“羞涩”之类的字眼来形容，好像只有初恋和羞涩之类才是最动人的字眼，最美好的情感，那就不全恰当了。不恰当的描写，就会给读者带来不真实的感觉。
