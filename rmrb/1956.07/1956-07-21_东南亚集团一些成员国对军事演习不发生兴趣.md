Xinhua News Agency, July 20th -- According to the "Guanghua Evening News" and "Xingtai Evening News" in Bangkok on July 14th, the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization (SEATO) Executive Secretariat revealed that the joint naval exercises originally planned to be held in the Gulf of Thailand recently have encountered difficulties due to the opposition of most member states of SEATO.

The report stated that most SEATO member states believe that the current international situation has greatly eased, and military exercises are of no benefit to the situation. Therefore, there is no need to repeatedly hold joint military exercises. These member states also believe that what should be emphasized now is how to promote the economic prosperity of SEATO countries, rather than military displays.

According to the report, the countries that are not interested in large-scale military exercises include the United Kingdom, Pakistan, New Zealand, and Australia.

    东南亚集团一些成员国
    对军事演习不发生兴趣
    新华社20日讯　据曼谷“光华晚报”和“星泰晚报”七月十四日刊载东南亚条约组织执行秘书处透露的消息，由于东南亚条约组织大部分成员国的反对，原来准备最近在泰国海湾举行的海军联合大演习遇到了困难。
    消息说，大部分东南亚条约组织成员国认为，目前国际局势已经大大缓和，军事演习对于局势毫无益处，因此，已经没有一再举行军事联合大演习的必要。这些成员国并且认为，现在应当重视的是如何促进东南亚条约组织国家的经济的繁荣，而不是作军事上的炫耀。
    据消息透露，对军事大演习不感兴趣的国家，计有英国、巴基斯坦、新西兰和澳大利亚等国。
