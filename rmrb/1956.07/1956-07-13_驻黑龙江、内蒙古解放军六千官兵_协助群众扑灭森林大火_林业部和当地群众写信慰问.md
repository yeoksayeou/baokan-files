    Six Thousand PLA Soldiers Stationed in Heilongjiang and Inner Mongolia
    Assist the Masses in Putting Out Forest Fires
    Ministry of Forestry and Local People Send Letters of Condolence and Appreciation
    (Our Newspaper) News: The Ministry of Forestry of the People's Republic of China sent a letter on June 28 to the army troops participating in extinguishing the forest fires in Huma County and Nenjiang County of Heilongjiang Province, and the Oroqen Autonomous Banner of Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, expressing gratitude and condolences to them.
    The letter said: You have displayed a high degree of patriotism, overcome the inconvenience of transportation and the difficulties of food and lodging, and launched an indomitable struggle against the fire. This exemplary action has strengthened the confidence of the broad masses in extinguishing the fire, encouraged their enthusiasm for protecting forests and preventing fires, and greatly benefited future forest protection and fire prevention work. The letter also said: Forest protection and fire prevention work is of extremely important significance for ensuring the realization of the great task of greening the motherland within twelve years. The troops are not only the most active and powerful fire extinguishing force, but also an important reliance for doing a good job in forest protection and fire prevention. In the letter, the Ministry of Forestry expressed its hope that the troops will continue to vigorously support forest protection and fire prevention work in the future.
    Furthermore, on May 19, a mountain fire broke out east of Beizhandao in Nenjiang County, Heilongjiang Province, and on the south bank of the Gugu River. The flames spread rapidly along the Xiaoxing'anling Mountains. On the 26th, fires broke out continuously in more than a dozen places north of Nenjiang and where Heilongjiang Province and Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region meet. The cities of Nenjiang, Aihui, and Huma were shrouded in a thick smog. After receiving intelligence, the troops stationed in this area successively sent more than 6,000 officers and soldiers and more than 140 vehicles. Under the leadership of the joint fire extinguishing headquarters of Heilongjiang and Inner Mongolia, they rushed to the scene in batches to fight the fire. The slogan of the officers and soldiers was: "We will never retreat until the mountain fire is eliminated!"
    The first team of fire fighters was blocked on the west bank of the wide Niqiu River. The rushing water in the river was impacting ice floes, and without boats, crossing the river was difficult. However, when the officers and soldiers saw the flames on the high mountains on the opposite bank being blown straight up by the strong wind, they no longer cared about the danger and cold, and swam across the river to counterattack the raging fire.
    After extinguishing the fires in places such as Daheishan, the second team of fire fighters traveled more than 700 li for two days and three nights by foot and by car to fight the fire near the Laogongsi fire site. Many comrades had blisters on their feet. As soon as they arrived at the fire site, they immediately pursued the fire, running 30 li in one breath, stopping the fire from spreading to the primeval forest. At this time, although the comrades were exhausted and needed to rest, the fire was raging in a certain place in front of them, so they continued to pursue the fire regardless of fatigue. Three hours later, the mountain fire in that area was completely extinguished.
    Another team of troops also repaired about 40 li of roads under extremely difficult conditions, ensuring the material support for the fire fighting team.
    After sixteen days of concerted efforts by the military and civilians, the mountain fires in more than a dozen large and small fire sites were finally extinguished. The exemplary behavior of the officers and soldiers in this fire extinguishing struggle has been widely spread among the people. In the fire-stricken areas, some Daur and Mongolian people who saw the people's army for the first time wrote letters to the officers and soldiers to express their gratitude and condolences.

    驻黑龙江、内蒙古解放军六千官兵
    协助群众扑灭森林大火
    林业部和当地群众写信慰问
    本报讯　中华人民共和国林业部，在六月二十八日发信给参加扑灭黑龙江省呼玛县、嫩江县和内蒙古自治区鄂伦春自治旗等地森林火灾的我军部队，对他们表示感谢和慰问。
    信上说：你们发扬了高度的爱国主义精神，克服了交通的不便和食宿的困难，向火灾展开不屈不挠的斗争。这种模范行动坚定了广大群众扑灭火灾的信心，鼓舞了他们护林防火的热情，大大有利于今后的护林防火工作。信上还说：护林防火工作对保障十二年内绿化祖国的伟大任务的实现，具有极重要的意义。部队不仅是一支最积极、最有力的扑火力量，而且也是做好护林防火工作的重要依靠。林业部在信中表示，希望部队今后继续大力支援护林防火工作。
    又讯　五月十九日，黑龙江省嫩江县北站道以东、固固河南岸一带发生了山火，火苗沿着小兴安岭山脉迅速蔓延。二十六日，火情又在嫩江以北、黑龙江省和内蒙古自治区接界的十多个地方连续发生。嫩江、瑷珲、呼玛等县城，被笼罩在一片浓烟黑雾中。驻在这一地区的部队得到情报后，先后派出官兵六千多人和汽车一百四十多辆，在黑龙江、内蒙古扑火联合指挥部的领导下，分批赶往现场投入扑灭火灾的战斗。官兵们的口号是：“不消灭山火，决不收兵！”
    部队的第一队扑火人员被阻挡在宽阔的泥鳅河西岸，河中湍急的水流冲击着冰块，没有船只，渡河是困难的。但是，当官兵们看见对岸的高山上狂风吹得火焰向上直窜的时候，他们再也顾不得危险和寒冷，就泅水过河，向烈火反攻。
    第二队扑火人员在扑灭了大黑山等处的火灾之后，又经过两天三夜的步行和乘车，赶路七百多里，前去老公司附近的火场扑火。很多同志的脚上都磨起了血泡。他们一到火场，就立刻进行追击，一气跑了三十里路，制止了正在向原始森林蔓延的火头。这时，同志们虽然精疲力尽，需要休息了，可是，前面某地的火势正旺，他们又不顾疲劳继续追击。三小时后，把该地的山火全部扑灭。
    部队的另一队人员，也在极端困难的条件下修补了大约四十里公路，保证了对扑火队的物质支援。
    经过十六天的军民一致努力，终于把大小十余处火场的山火全部扑灭。部队官兵在这次扑火的斗争中的模范行为，在人民群众中广为传扬。在发生火灾的地区有些初次见到人民军队的达呼尔族人和蒙古族人，都写信给部队官兵，表示感谢和慰问。　（刘　兵）
