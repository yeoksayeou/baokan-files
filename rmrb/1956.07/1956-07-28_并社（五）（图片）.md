(Adapted from Xu Guangyao's original work "Shu Ming and Yinghua")

　　17 Shu Ming secretly directed Grandpa Guo Laoshan to coax his father into going home, while explaining with a smile: the public accumulation fund cannot be decided by one person, it must be handled in accordance with the Party's policies.

　　18 While explaining, Shu Ming waved his hands and bowed, making the pouting mouths of the girls from the Second Cooperative burst into laughter. Shu Ming glanced at Yinghua and saw that she was also smiling, her face red. The tension dissipated and everyone dispersed.

　　19 After everyone left, Shu Ming called out: "Guixia, what do the Youth League members of your Second Cooperative think about what happened just now?" Guixia asked Yinghua, and Yinghua said: "I think the problem probably lies with my father."

　　20 Shu Ming said: "They are all our elders, we have to persuade them on both sides..." Yinghua was afraid she couldn't persuade her father. Shu Ming then said: "There are no difficulties that cannot be overcome in front of Youth League members, using our brains will find a solution." As they spoke, they both faced away from each other.

    17　树明一面暗暗支使郭老山老爷子把他爹哄着拉回家去，一面笑嘻嘻地解释：公积金的事不是能由一个人作主的，总得按党的政策办事。
    18　树明一面解释，一面摆手作揖，把二社的那些小闺女们噘着的嘴“噗嗤噗嗤”全笑破了。树明把眼向莺花一溜，见她也红着脸微笑了，大家气儿一消，也就走散。
    19　人们都走了，树明叫一声：“桂霞，你们二社的青年团员对刚才的事有什么意见呐？”桂霞转问莺花，莺花说：“我看问题八成出在我爹那儿。”
    20　树明说：“他们都是咱的老人，得两头劝一劝……”莺花却怕劝不动她爹。树明又说：“青年团员面前没有克服不了的困难，动脑筋就有办法。”两人说话，脸都朝着旁人。
