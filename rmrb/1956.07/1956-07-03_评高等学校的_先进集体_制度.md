Commenting on the "Advanced Collective" System in Institutions of Higher Education
Zhang Ming

    The implementation of a system for rewarding "Advanced Collectives" in institutions of higher education began in Tsinghua University around March 1954. The regulations of Tsinghua University for rewarding "Advanced Collectives" are as follows: First, the overall academic performance of the entire class should be excellent, with the average grade being among the best in the entire university; second, the proportion of students passing the labor-defense system training should be among the highest in the entire university; third, active participation in various mass activities and good performance; fourth, the entire class should play a exemplary role in unity, friendship, conducting criticism and self-criticism, and observing study discipline. According to incomplete statistics from August 1955, more than forty institutions of higher education across the country had followed Tsinghua University's experience and established a system for evaluating and rewarding "Advanced Collectives," with reward regulations basically the same as those of Tsinghua University. In practice, the school administration generally first promulgates regulations for rewarding "Advanced Collectives," and the president or dean delivers a mobilization report to all students, calling on each class to carry out the work of striving for "Advanced Collective" status. Various propaganda institutions of the school conduct publicity around the "Advanced Collective"; and, with the Youth League branch of the class as the core, discussions are held to study the shortcomings and problems of the class, make plans to improve the shortcomings and strive for "Advanced Collective" status, and strengthen the work of the class collective. During the evaluation, the class first submits written materials to the department evaluation group to compete for "Advanced Collective" status. The department evaluation group compares the materials submitted by each class to determine a preliminary list, which is announced within the department to solicit opinions from the masses or submitted for mass evaluation, and then reported to the school evaluation committee for final evaluation. The class that is rated as an "Advanced Collective" is awarded the title of "Advanced Collective" by the school, given banners, certificates, or material rewards, and the name or photo of the class collective is listed on the school's honor roll, promoting their good deeds, summarizing and popularizing their experience, and so on. In terms of evaluation methods, many schools have stipulated very complicated procedures. Tongji University once stipulated an "Advanced Collective" preliminary evaluation record form, including more than eighty items, which were very complicated.

    The "Advanced Collective" reward system, as a method of political work, has played a certain role. For example, it has played a role in strengthening students' study discipline, consolidating students' professional thinking, inspiring young people's ambition, sense of collective honor and spirit of unity and mutual assistance, enhancing collectivist ideas, and developing criticism and self-criticism. However, from the fundamental nature of the "Advanced Collective," it is a flawed method. It is essentially a comprehensive and collective competition system that includes learning, political and ideological education, social activities, and physical exercise. It itself violates the objective law that collective competition cannot be carried out in learning and political and ideological education work; it violates the principles of pedagogy and requires students to be collectively advanced in an egalitarian manner. Therefore, in actual work, the following two serious problems have occurred.

    The first problem is that it violates the law of gradual progress in learning, erroneously requires students to be collectively advanced, excessively emphasizes learning mutual assistance, and to a certain extent ignores students' learning autonomy and the role of teachers' guidance.

    Good academic performance is the primary condition for evaluating "Advanced Collectives." Although most schools no longer have rigid requirements for specific academic performance in their regulations, as they did in the past, academic performance is still an important standard that is most specific and easy to compare during actual evaluation. When Peking University evaluated in 1955, it required that classes with excellent grades reaching more than 79% could be rated as "Advanced Collectives." Some classes, although meeting the standards in all other aspects, were not rated because their excellent grades did not reach 79%. It can be seen from the practices of many schools that excellent academic performance is an important condition for being rated as an "Advanced Collective."

    Because the "Advanced Collective" reward system requires students to collectively improve their exam scores, the students in each class, especially the class leaders who are actively striving for "Advanced Collective" status, pay great attention to the overall average score of the class. In order to improve the class's exam scores, they put forward some inappropriate requirements, some incorrect slogans are popular among the students, and some measures and methods that violate the laws of learning are adopted. Some classes in Tsinghua University proposed requirements to achieve a score of 4.something in exams; some classes in Peking University proposed slogans such as "not letting anyone fall behind" and "eliminating 3s." Some classes in Tsinghua University held guarantee meetings or oath-taking rallies to strive for "Advanced Collective" status, asking students to express their attitudes at the meetings. There are also many classes where all the students gather at the entrance of the examination hall to wait for news when students with poor grades are taking the exam, and everyone shakes hands to congratulate if they do well, and everyone is disappointed if they do poorly. After the exam, many class leaders immediately collect the exam scores of the students in their class and make written statistics. This type of practice makes the average students pay close attention to whether they are above or below the overall average score of the class. If they are above the overall average score, they are happy; if they are below the overall average score, they are worried. For those students with poor academic performance, this creates a kind of pressure, artificially increasing their ideological and learning burden, and even making them feel that they are a stumbling block to the "Advanced Collective," breeding emotions of being unable to hold their heads up in front of their classmates and being ashamed to face others. For students with poor learning foundations, it is already a heavy burden to be able to pass the exam and upgrade according to the national examination system, and it is obviously inappropriate to add this or that external pressure.

    Students helping each other in learning is necessary and has a certain auxiliary effect on students' digestion and consolidation of the knowledge they have learned; however, students should mainly rely on teachers' guidance and students' conscious and diligent study to truly, firmly, and deeply grasp knowledge, and cannot rely on collective mutual assistance to improve suddenly in a short period of time. Many schools' class organizations, in order to strive for "Advanced Collective," disregard this characteristic of learning and excessively emphasize collective mutual assistance in learning. Some classes, in the name of the class or the Party and League organizations, put forward the so-called "voluntary combination, organizational allocation," "good and bad combination" principle, organizing students with excellent grades and students with poor grades to study together, requiring students with excellent grades to accompany students with poor grades to review their lessons together, supervise each other in taking notes during class, exchange notes with each other after class, re-explain the courses that the teacher has already taught in class, tutor and answer difficult questions, and provide comprehensive guidance and assistance before the exam. Many class leaders also took some external assistance methods before the exam, attempting to temporarily improve the exam scores of all students in the class. Some students with excellent grades did not have time to study deeply the difficult problems they felt before the exam in order to help others. The result of this excessive emphasis on learning mutual assistance not only blurs the teacher's leading role in learning and ignores students' autonomy in learning, but also hinders the cultivation of students' spirit of hard study and independent thinking ability, evens out students' academic performance, makes some students with poor academic performance feel burdened and stressed, and easily produces a certain psychological dependence, while affecting the learning quality of some excellent students.

    The root cause of the above problems is that the "Advanced Collective" reward system itself has the nature of a learning competition. From the form, the "Advanced Collective" reward is nothing more than an administrative reward system, and it does not engage in a set of criticized practices such as challenge competitions, mobile red flags, and learning mutual assistance groups between classes in the school; but from the essence, that is, from the reward regulations, practices, evaluation content, and the impact of this work on students' learning and its consequences, it all has the nature of a competition. Such as students paying too much attention to scores and not enough attention to solid knowledge, pre-planning and requiring students' academic performance, taking some measures that violate the laws of learning to try to improve students' exam scores, excessively emphasizing collective mutual assistance in learning, creating undue pressure on students with poor academic performance, etc., are all an inevitable manifestation of the learning competition nature of the "Advanced Collective" reward system itself, not an accidental or leadership failure. How well the leadership grasps the situation has an impact on the extent to which the learning competition is carried out and its consequences. Even schools that have grasped the situation well will inevitably have problems.

    The second problem is that in implementing the educational policy of all-round development, it does not pay attention to teaching students according to their aptitude, requiring everything to be uniform and average, which has promoted simplification and formalism in political and ideological education work, restricted the rational development of students' personal strengths and interests, and hindered the cultivation of students' independent thinking ability.

    The sources of students in institutions of higher education are different, their learning, physical foundations and conditions are different, the age difference is also relatively large, and each student has different interests and hobbies in the subjects they study, physical exercise, and social activities. However, the "Advanced Collective" reward system ignores this difference and personality of students, ignores the need to "teach students according to their aptitude," and generally requires students to develop evenly and be collectively advanced in all aspects. For example, in learning, it requires everyone to make progress in all subjects at the same time, and strive to get a score of 4 or 5 in every subject; in physical exercise, it requires everyone to pass the labor-defense system training; in social activities, it requires everyone to actively participate in "various activities"; without distinguishing different objects, proposing different requirements, and carrying out meticulous education and cultivation work for the different characteristics of various types of students. In students' lives and daily political and ideological education work, it also interferes too much, demands uniformity, and inappropriately emphasizes collective action and organizes too many social activities, which affects their normal study and rest. In order to show collectivity and strive to "play an exemplary role," many schools' students often engage in too many collective activities, such as watching movies, dancing, listening to music, Sunday outings, cultural entertainment performances, walking and resting, etc., collectively. Some classes also actively find many social jobs to do in order to show their advancement and activeness. Students in the second grade of Peking University's plant physiology major, in the anti-waste campaign, found a large number of shirts, hats, pants, broken socks, and other items discarded by students from the garbage dump, mobilized the students in the class to wash them, and let the original owners claim them.

    Because the "Advanced Collective" system excessively emphasizes collective life and promotes students to organize too many social activities, this naturally cannot but increase the burden on students, make students' study and life too tense, too rigid, and too constrained, and make students' interests, hobbies, personality, and strengths not get rational development, which is obviously unfavorable for the country to cultivate outstanding construction talents with independent working ability and who can creatively advance China's scientific cause. However, some comrades do not see the essence of the problem, and are confused by the superficially enthusiastic phenomenon, and regard the "Advanced Collective" system as a good way of political work. In fact, it relaxes the arduous and meticulous political and ideological education work.

    The reason for the above problems is that the educational ideas of some school leaders are not clear, and they unilaterally understand the policy of all-round development as average requirements and average development. In terms of leadership style, they are accustomed to promoting various major tasks of the school with the style of launching a movement. This educational thought and leadership style are manifested in many tasks of the current institutions of higher education. The "Advanced Collective" reward system is the most concentrated organizational form that embodies this educational thought and leadership style.

    It is completely correct and necessary to carry out collectivist education for students in institutions of higher education. However, the practice of formulating "Advanced Collective" regulations and promoting the "Advanced Collective" reward system has many drawbacks and should be considered for change so that our institutions of higher education can adopt more methods of teaching students according to their different characteristics, so that students can get better development.

    评高等学校的“先进集体”制度
    张明
    在高等学校实行奖励“先进集体”的制度，是1954年3月间从清华大学开始的。清华大学奖励“先进集体”的条例是：第一，全班学生学习成绩优良，总平均成绩为全校各班中较好者；第二，劳卫制锻炼及格比例为全校各班中较高者；第三，积极参加各项群众活动且表现较好者；第四，全班在团结友爱、开展批评和自我批评、遵守学习纪律等各方面都起模范作用者。根据1955年8月份不完全的统计，全国已经有四十多所高等学校仿照清华大学的经验，建立了评奖“先进集体”的制度，奖励条例基本上和清华大学相同。在作法上，一般是首先由学校行政颁布奖励“先进集体”的条例，校、院长向全体学生作动员报告，号召各班开展争取“先进集体”的工作。学校各种宣传机构围绕“先进集体”进行宣传；并且以班的青年团支部为核心，进行酝酿讨论，研究班上的缺点和问题，作出改进缺点争取“先进集体”的计划，加强班集体的工作。评选的时候，先由班向系评选组提出争取“先进集体”的书面材料，系评选小组根据各班提出的材料加以评比，确定初步名单，在系内公布，征求群众意见或交由群众评议，然后报送校评选委员会最后评定。被评为“先进集体”的班，就由学校授予“先进集体”的称号，给予奖旗、奖状或者物质奖励，并且把班集体的名字或者照片列在学校的光荣榜上，宣传他们的优良事绩，总结和推广他们的经验等。在评比的方法上，不少学校规定得十分繁琐，同济大学曾经规定了一种“先进集体”初评纪录表，包括八十多项，内容十分繁杂。
    评奖“先进集体”制度，作为一种政治工作的方式，曾经起过一定的作用。例如对加强学生的学习纪律，巩固学生的专业思想，鼓舞青年的上进心、集体荣誉感和团结互助精神，增强集体主义观念，开展批评和自我批评等方面，都起了一定的作用。但是从“先进集体”的根本性质来看，它是一种错误的方法。它实质上是一种包括学习、政治思想教育、社会活动、身体锻炼等各个方面的全面的和集体的竞赛制度。它本身是违反了在学习上和在政治思想教育工作上不能开展集体竞赛的客观规律；违反了教育学原理，平均主义地要求学生集体先进。所以在实际工作中就发生了下述两个严重问题。
    第一个问题，它违反了学习必须循序渐进的规律，错误地要求学生集体先进，过分地强调了学习互助，一定程度上忽视了学生学习的自觉性和教师的指导作用。
    学习成绩的好坏是评选“先进集体”的首要条件。目前大多数学校虽然在条例上已经没有像过去那样硬性规定对学习成绩的具体要求，但是在实际评选的时候，学习成绩仍然是一条最具体的和最便于评比的重要标准。北京大学1955年评选的时候，就要求优良成绩达到百分之七十九以上的班，才能被评为“先进集体”。有的班虽然其他各方面都够标准，因为优良成绩没有达到百分之七十九，就没有评上。从许多学校的作法可以看出，学习成绩优良是被评为“先进集体”的重要条件。
    由于评奖“先进集体”制度要求学生集体地提高考试成绩，使各班的学生，特别是那些正在积极争取“先进集体”的班的班干部，非常注意和重视全班总的平均分数。为了提高班的考试成绩，他们提出了一些不适当的要求，在学生当中流行着一些不正确的口号，并且采取了一些违反学习规律的措施和办法。清华大学某些班提出要求考试成绩达到四点几分；北京大学某些班提出“不让一个人掉队”、“消灭三分”的口号。清华大学某些班召开了争取“先进集体”的保证会或者誓师大会，要同学们在会上表示态度。还有不少班在学习差的同学考试的时候，全班同学群集在考场门口等待消息，考得好大家握手祝贺，考不好大家扫兴。考试以后，不少班的班干部又立即汇集本班同学的考试成绩，并且作出书面统计。这样一类做法，使一般成绩中间的学生，非常注意自己是在班的总平均分数以上还是在班的总平均分数以下。在总平均分数以上则喜，在总平均分数以下则忧。对于那些学习成绩差的学生，则形成一种压力，人为地加重了他们思想上和学习上的负担，甚至使他们感到自己是“先进集体”的绊脚石，滋长了在同学们面前抬不起头和无脸见人的情绪。对于学习基础差的学生，按照国家规定的考试制度能够考试及格和升级，负担已经很重，再加以这种或者那种外来的压力，显然是不应当的。
    学生在学习上互相帮助，对学生消化和巩固所学的知识，是必要的和有一定的辅助作用的；但是学生要切实、牢固、深刻地掌握知识，主要应当依靠教师的指导和学生自觉的刻苦钻研，不能依靠集体互助在短期内突击提高。不少学校的班组织为了争取“先进集体”，却不顾及学习上的这种特点，过分地强调了学习上的集体互助。有些班以班或党、团组织的名义，提出所谓“自愿结合组织调配”“好坏搭配”的原则，把成绩优良的学生和成绩差的学生互相组织起来，要成绩优良的学生经常陪同学习差的同学一块温习功课，上课的时候互相监督抄笔记，下课的时候互相对笔记，重讲教师在课堂上已经讲授过的课程，辅导和解答疑难问题，考试前给予全面辅导和帮助等。不少班干部在临近考试的时候还采取了一些外力突击帮助的办法，企图临时提高全班学生的考试成绩。有些成绩优良的学生，在考试前为了要帮助别人，自己感到的疑难问题，反而没有时间去深入复习。这样过分强调学习互助的结果，不仅模糊了教师在学习上的主导作用和忽视了学生在学习上的自觉性，而且妨碍了培养学生刻苦钻研精神和独立思考能力，拉平了学生的学习成绩，使一些学习差的学生既感到负担和压力，又容易产生某种依赖心理，同时影响了某些优秀学生的学习质量。
    产生上述问题的根本原因，是由于评奖“先进集体”制度本身带有学习竞赛的性质，从形式上来看，评奖“先进集体”不过是一种行政上的奖励制度，并没有在学校里搞班同班之间的挑战竞赛、流动红旗、学习互助组等一套受过批判的做法；但从实质上来看，也就是从评奖的条例、作法、评比内容以及这一工作对学生学习的影响和它的后果来看，它都是带有竞赛性质的。像学生当中过分地注意分数而注意踏实地掌握知识不够，对学生的学习成绩预先提出规划和要求，采取一些违反学习规律的办法来试图提高学生的考试成绩，过分地强调学习上的集体互助，对学习差的学生造成不应该有的压力等等，都是评奖“先进集体”制度本身带有学习竞赛性质的一种必然性的表现，并不是什么偶然性或者领导方面没有掌握好的问题。领导方面掌握得好坏，对学习竞赛进行的程度和它的后果是有影响的，即令是掌握得好的学校，也不免发生问题。
    第二个问题，它在贯彻执行全面发展的教育方针上，不注意因材施教，事事强求一律，平均要求，以致助长了政治思想教育工作中的简单化和形式主义倾向，限制了学生个人特长和兴趣爱好的合理发展，妨碍了培养学生的独立思考能力。
    高等学校学生的来源不同，他们的学习、身体的基础和条件不同，年龄的差别也比较大，每个学生对自己所学习的功课，对体育运动、社会活动的兴趣和爱好也很不同。但是评奖“先进集体”制度，却忽视了学生的这种区别性和个性，忽视了对学生要“因材施教”，而一般化地从各方面来要求学生平均发展和集体先进。如在学习上要求大家各门课齐头并进，门门课都要争取考四分或五分；身体锻炼上，要求大家都要达到劳卫制锻炼及格；社会活动上，要求大家都来积极参加“各项活动”；而没有区别不同对象，提出不同的要求，并且针对各种类型学生的不同特点，进行细致的教育和教养工作。在学生的生活和日常政治思想教育工作上，也是干涉过多，强求一律，并且违反了学生的自愿，不适当地强调了集体行动和组织了过多的社会活动，以致影响了他们正常的学习和休息。不少学校的学生为了表现集体，争取“起模范作用”，往往搞了过多的集体活动，如周末看电影、跳舞、听音乐、星期日游玩、文化娱乐会演、散步休息等等，都要集体。有些班为了表示先进和积极，还主动地找了许多社会工作来做。北京大学植物生理专业二年级学生，在反浪费的时候，从垃圾堆里找了大批同学所扔掉的衬衣、帽子、裤子、破袜子等物，动员班上的学生洗出来，让原主来认领。
    由于“先进集体”制度过分地强调了集体生活，并且促使学生组织了过多的社会活动，这样自然不能不加重学生的负担，使学生的学习和生活过分紧张、过分刻板和过分拘束，并且使学生的兴趣、爱好、个性和特长得不到合理的发展，这对于国家培养具有独立工作能力并且能够创造性地把我国科学事业推向前进的出色的建设人材，显然是不利的。但是，有的同志却看不见问题的实质，而为那些表面热烈的现象所迷惑，把“先进集体”制度当作良好的政治工作方式。而实际上却放松了艰苦细致的政治思想教育工作。
    产生上述问题的原因，是由于某些学校领导方面的教育思想不明确，把全面发展的方针片面地了解为平均要求和平均发展，在领导作风上，又习惯于以搞运动的作风来推动学校的各项重大工作。这种教育思想和领导作风，在目前高等学校许多工作上都有表现。而评奖“先进集体”制度，正是体现这种教育思想和领导作风的一个最集中的组织形式。
    在高等学校中对学生进行集体主义教育，是完全正确的和必要的。但是制定“先进集体”条例，推行奖励“先进集体”制度这种作法，弊病很多，应当考虑加以改变，让我们的高等学校能够按照学生的不同的特点，更多地采取因材施教的办法，使学生得到更好的发展。
