The people who have heard the performance of Yugoslav vocalists all admire their artistic attainments. The most impressive thing about their singing is the unique creation in vocal art skills. Like tenor Marinković, mezzo-soprano Lipša-Tofović, soprano Bukovitz, and bass Jančić, they have a perfect system in the scientific training of vocal techniques; their singing is loud and beautiful, making people infinitely nostalgic.

In the Yugoslav artists' performance evening, the Slovenian male octet choir's program was particularly popular. They sang "Partisan Song," which described the Yugoslav people's struggle for the freedom and independence of their motherland, and also sang the humorous and interesting "Frog Wedding."

They tenderly and affectionately expressed "Tonight! Tonight" which was a farewell to their loved one; and also solemnly and profoundly praised the epic "Komitaji Song" of the battle against Turkish aggression. The lively and lovely "My Father Has Two Horses" is so playful and humorous; the large-scale "First Suite" fragment, however, has clear layers and strong contrasts.

These many different styles, different forms, and varied programs, performed so finely and beautifully, fully demonstrate that this octet choir has exquisite and broad artistic creativity. The singing of eight people is so harmonious and consistent, and the elasticity of the sound expression is so great. Especially in the two songs "Tonight! Tonight" and "My Father Has Two Horses," the choir's singing played the highest effect of the ensemble. Each of them is an excellent soloist, and also a perfect, choral whole. Those lyrical passages are truly handled with meticulous care.

This ensemble not only has a high level of choral art, but also has new creative significance in its performance style. They did not entirely inherit the serious and rigid performance style of traditional Western chamber music, but adopted a natural, lively, and life-filled humorous performance style. Therefore, they can integrate with the broad audience.

In the Slovenian Republic in northwestern Yugoslavia, there are countless small chamber choir organizations. This kind of amateur choir has a long tradition. The members of the Slovenian male octet choir are strictly selected from many amateur and professional choirs. Among them, three (tenor Delmorda, Lepšak, and bass Petrovčić) were originally soloists in the opera house. In order to better express Yugoslav folk songs and original songs, and to give greater play to the artistic effect of multi-part singing, they divided the voices very carefully and sang in an a cappella form.

Professor Paulé, the artistic director of the ensemble, is one of the famous choir conductors in Yugoslavia. He has made great contributions to the growth of this young career.

This ensemble sings excellent Yugoslav folk songs and art songs, as well as folk songs and original works from all over the world. By this year, they have accumulated about 150 beautiful songs. Because they have so many rich, colorful and lovable programs, they can independently undertake a performance of an evening. I firmly believe that this light and lively form of choral art will not only be warmly embraced by the people of our country, but will also be a good example for us to expand the practice of choral art.

    风趣的斯洛文尼亚八重唱
    李凌
    听过南斯拉夫声乐家表演的人，都赞赏他们的艺术造诣。他们的歌唱，给我们的印象最强烈的是声乐艺术技巧上独到的创造。像男高音玛林柯维奇，次高音利普萨——托弗维奇，女高音布柯维茨，男低音扬契奇，他们在声乐技巧的科学锻炼上，有着完美的体系；歌声嘹亮而优美，使人无限留恋。
    在南斯拉夫艺术家表演的晚会中，斯洛文尼亚男声八重合唱团的节目，特别惹人喜爱。他们演唱了描写南斯拉夫人民为祖国的自由独立而斗争的“游击队员之歌”，也演唱了诙谐有趣的“青蛙的婚礼”。
    他们柔美而深情地表现了和爱人告别的“今夕啊！今夕”；也庄严、深厚地歌颂了反土耳其侵略战斗的史诗“柯米塔吉之歌”。活泼小巧的“我的父亲有两匹马”，是那样俏皮、风趣；大型的“第一组曲”片断，却是层次清楚，对比强烈。
    这许多不同风格、不同形式，变化多端的节目，表现得这般精细美妙，充分地显示出这个八重合唱团具有精湛、广博的艺术创造力。八个人的歌声，是这么调协一致，声音表现力的伸缩性这么大，特别在“今夕啊！今夕”和“我的父亲有两匹马”两首歌中，合唱团的歌唱，发挥了重唱的最高效果。他们每一个人都是优秀的独唱家，又是一个完美的、合唱的整体。那些抒情的乐段，真是处理得细致入微。
    这个重唱团，不仅有着高度的合唱艺术水平，在演唱风格上，也带有新创的意义。他们并没有全部因袭西方传统的室内乐的严肃、呆板的表演方式，而是采取了自然活泼、富有生活风趣的表演作风，因此，他们能够和广大的听众打成一片。
    在南斯拉夫西北的斯洛文尼亚共和国，有着无数室内的小合唱组织，这种业余的合唱队有着悠久的传统。斯洛文尼亚男声八重合唱团的团员，是从许多业余的和专业的合唱队中，经过严格的选拔挑选出来的。其中有三位（男高音德尔摩达、列普夏克以及男低音彼得罗夫契奇，原是歌剧院的独唱家。他们为了更好地表现南斯拉夫的民歌和创作歌曲，为了更大的发挥分声部的重唱艺术效能，把声部分得很细致，并且采取无伴奏的形式演唱。
    重唱团的艺术指导保莱教授，是南斯拉夫有名的合唱团指挥之一。他对这个年轻的事业的成长，有着极大的贡献。
    这个重唱团，演唱南斯拉夫的优秀的民间歌曲和艺术歌曲，也演唱世界各国的民歌和创作。到今年，他们已经积累了约一百五十首优美的歌曲。由于他们拥有这么多的丰富多采、令人喜爱的节目，所以他们能够单独担任一个晚会的演出。我深信，像这样轻便、活泼的合唱艺术形式，不仅会受到我国人民的热烈的拥戴，也将是我们扩大合唱艺术实践的一个好榜样。（附图片）
