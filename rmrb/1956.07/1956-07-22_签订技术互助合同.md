    The People's Daily published a report on July 18th about textile and silk workers in Wuxi City widely signing technical assistance contracts in the advanced producer movement, greatly improving production technology. This is worth noting.
    Technical assistance contracts are also called "teaching and learning contracts." About 80% of the workers who signed technical assistance contracts at the jointly owned Lixin Textile Factory have improved their technical skills. Wang Quanying and Zuo Qin芳 of the jointly owned Zhenxin Textile Factory had consistently failed to meet their quotas. Since signing a mutual assistance contract with advanced producer Zhang Ruiying, they have consistently received Zhang Ruiying's help, and both completed their quotas in May and June. Zuo Qin芳 has been named an advanced producer, and Wang Quanying has also reached the level of advanced producer. In the jointly owned Wuxi Silk Factory No. 5, no worker fully completed the state plan last year. However, since they signed a mutual assistance contract with the local state-owned Silk Factory No. 1 in May this year, 455 people fully completed the state plan in May, and 104 people received quality awards, thanks to Factory No. 1 sending people to help open advanced experience schools and sending people to the factory to demonstrate operational techniques. By the second quarter, the entire factory had fully completed the state plan. These facts show that organizing workers in the same trade within enterprises to sign technical assistance contracts, and organizing similar enterprises to sign mutual assistance contracts, is an effective way to enable the backward to quickly catch up with the advanced level in the vigorous advanced producer movement.
    Technical assistance contracts between workers in the same trade and mutual assistance contracts between similar enterprises are both signed on a voluntary basis. It differs from general individual or inter-factory competitions among workers in the same trade because, although workers or enterprises participating in general competitions have a responsibility to exchange experiences and supervise each other to achieve the competition conditions, the binding effect of the competition conditions is very limited, and there are no specific provisions on the extent of mutual assistance and supervision. However, the mutual assistance contract goes a step further. The contract stipulates that Party A will help Party B master a certain technique within one month. If Party B fails to master it within one month, it is not only Party B's responsibility but also Party A's responsibility. Therefore, through mutual assistance contracts, those responsible for teaching can be more concerned about the progress of those being taught, and those being taught can be more actively learning. This is why advanced producer Zhang Ruiying of the jointly owned Zhenxin Textile Factory often observed the operations of Wang Quanying and Zuo Qin芳 and promptly pointed out their shortcomings after signing a mutual assistance contract with them.
    Since the launch of the advanced producer movement, many workers have been willing to pursue advancement and catch up with the advanced, to make more and greater contributions to the cause of socialist construction; many advanced producers are also willing to help others and improve together. However, in some enterprises, due to shortcomings in the organization work of the leadership, many people who are willing to learn are struggling to find a teacher, while those who are willing to teach are struggling to find a student. Organizing workers in the same trade to sign mutual assistance contracts can overcome this shortcoming and help workers realize their desire to improve together.
    Another feature of mutual assistance contracts is that they set specific goals based on the strengths and weaknesses of each individual and each enterprise. For example, if Party A's output is higher than Party B's, the two parties will sign a contract with the content of Party A helping Party B to increase output. If Party B's quality is better than Party A's, the two parties will sign a contract with the content of Party B helping Party A to improve quality. If Party A's cost is lower than Party B's, the two parties will sign a contract with the content of Party A helping Party B to reduce costs. The planning and management level, technical level, and political work level of Wuxi Local State-owned Silk Factory No. 1 are higher than those of the jointly owned Silk Factory No. 5, while the skills of the silk braiding workers are lower than those of Silk Factory No. 5. Therefore, the mutual assistance contract stipulates that Silk Factory No. 1 is responsible for helping Silk Factory No. 5 improve its planning and management level, technical level, and political work level, and Silk Factory No. 5 is responsible for helping Silk Factory No. 1 improve its silk braiding technical level. Because what is being taught is one's own expertise and what is being learned is one's own weaknesses, it is easy to teach, there is an interest in learning, and the results are great. The better such contracts are implemented, the more conducive they are to fully and over-fulfilling the state plan.
    Because mutual assistance contracts are formulated according to the strengths and weaknesses of each worker and each enterprise, the Party organization, trade union, and administration of the enterprise must deeply understand the strengths and weaknesses of each person before the contract is signed, and study who should sign the contract with whom in order to achieve the effect of "learning from each other's strengths to make up for weaknesses." After the contract is signed, it is also necessary to organize workers to regularly check the implementation of the contract, conduct specific work for specific people, and help them overcome difficulties. If the situation changes, they should be helped to revise the contract according to the new situation. In order to promote the spirit of mutual assistance and fraternity, and to encourage workers to continuously advance, those who help others improve their skills should be rewarded; those who humbly learn from others and strive to catch up with the advanced should also be rewarded. Similarly, enterprises that sign mutual assistance contracts should also be rewarded for helping other enterprises advance and for striving to catch up with the advanced. Failure to do these things will render mutual assistance contracts a mere formality. Formalistic things are not worth a penny. Therefore, actively organizing workers to sign and implement mutual assistance contracts is an important task for enterprise leaders.
    Of course, there are many ways to help the backward reach the advanced level. Organizing workers in the same trade to sign technical assistance contracts and organizing similar enterprises to sign mutual assistance contracts are only one of them. The 53 Factory conducts in-depth investigations into the reasons why each backward worker is backward and uses different methods to educate them, which is also a method. The railway system and the textile industry system organize advanced producers to go to relevant enterprises for roving performances, which is also a method. The First Ministry of Machine Building organizes comprehensive working groups including experts from various fields to go to some enterprises that are not producing well enough to help them carry out comprehensive and thorough reforms, which is also a method. Carrying out competitions in the same trade and organizing similar factories to exchange experiences are also methods. There are also other methods. We are introducing the benefits of mutual assistance contracts here not because we say that other methods are not good. For any industrial sector and any enterprise, the above methods can and must be used simultaneously, complementing each other, to achieve the goal of common improvement more quickly.

### 签订技术互助合同

    签订技术互助合同
    七月十八日，本报发表了无锡市纺织缫丝工人在先进生产者运动中，普遍订立技术互助合同，大大地提高了生产技术的消息。这是值得注意的。
    技术互助合同也叫做“包教包学合同”。公私合营丽新纺织厂签订技术互助合同的工人，有80％左右都提高了技术水平。公私合营振新纺织厂穿棕工人王泉英和左琴芳，一向完不成计划；自从同先进生产者章瑞英订立互助合同以后，经常得到章瑞英的帮助，在五、六月份都完成了计划。左琴芳已经被评为先进生产者，王泉英也已达到先进生产者水平。无锡市公私合营缫丝第五厂，去年一年没有一个工人全面完成国家计划，但是，自从今年五月，他们跟地方国营缫丝第一厂签订了互助合同以后，由于第一厂派人帮助开办先进经验学校，以及派人到厂表演操作技术，五月份就有455人全面完成了国家计划，104人得到优胜质量奖。到第二季度全厂就全面完成了国家计划。这些事实说明：在蓬蓬勃勃的先进生产者运动中，组织企业内部同工种工人签订技术互助合同，组织同类企业之间签订互助合同，是使落后的迅速赶上先进水平的一个有效办法。
    同工种工人的技术互助合同和同类企业之间的互助合同，都是在双方自愿的基础上签订的。它不同于一般的同工种的工人之间的个人竞赛或厂际竞赛，因为参加一般的同工种竞赛的工人或企业，虽然有责任互相交流经验，互相督促，以实现竞赛条件，但是，竞赛条件的约束作用十分有限，彼此帮助到什么程度，督促到什么程度，都没有具体的规定。而互助合同却进了一步。合同规定甲在一个月内帮助乙掌握一种技术，要是乙在一个月没掌握好，这不只是乙的责任，同时也是甲的责任。所以，通过互助合同，可以使负责教的人更加关心被教的人的进步，使被教的人更加积极学习。公私合营振新纺织厂先进生产者章瑞英跟王泉英、左琴芳签订互助合同以后，所以经常观察这两个人的操作，经常及时地指出他们的缺点，就是这个道理。
    自从开展先进生产者运动以来，许多工人都愿意追求先进，赶上先进，为社会主义建设事业作出更多更大的贡献；许多先进生产者也愿意帮助别人，共同提高。但是，在某些企业里，由于领导方面的组织工作有缺点，许多愿意学习的人却苦于找不到老师，而愿教的人又苦于找不到徒弟。组织同工种工人签订互助合同，正可以克服这个缺点，有利于工人实现共同提高的愿望。
    互助合同还有一个特点，就是根据每一个人、每一个企业的长处和短处，订出具体的目标。例如，甲的产量比乙的高，双方就订一个以甲帮助乙提高产量为内容的合同。乙的质量比甲的好，双方就订一个以乙帮助甲提高质量为内容的合同。甲的成本比乙的低，双方就订一个以甲帮助乙降低成本为内容的合同。无锡市地方国营缫丝第一厂的计划管理水平、技术水平和政治工作水平都比公私合营缫丝第五厂的高，而编丝工人的技术则低于缫丝第五厂的，所以在互助合同里，就规定缫丝第一厂负责帮助缫丝第五厂提高计划管理水平、技术水平和政治工作水平，规定缫丝第五厂帮助缫丝第一厂提高编丝技术水平。因为所教的是自己的特长，所学的是自己的短处，所以教起来容易，学起来也有兴趣，收效很大。这样的合同实现得越好，就越有利于全面地超额地完成国家计划。
    正因为互助合同是根据每一个工人、每一个企业的长处和短处来订的，所以在合同签订之前，企业的党组织、工会和行政，必须深入了解每一个人的长处和短处，研究谁跟谁签订合同才能收到“取长补短”的效果。合同签订以后，还要组织工人定期检查合同执行的情况，对具体的人进行具体的工作，帮助他们克服困难。情况改变了的，就要帮助他们根据新情况修改合同。为了发扬互助友爱精神，为了鼓励工人们不断地前进，对于那些帮助别人提高技术的人，应给以奖励；对于那些虚心向别人学习、努力赶上先进的人，也要给以奖励。同样，对于签订互助合同的企业，也要做到帮助别的企业前进的有奖，努力赶上先进的也有奖。不做好这些工作，就会使互助合同流于形式。形式主义的东西，是一个钱也不值的。所以，积极地组织工人签订和实现互助合同，乃是企业领导者的重要工作。
    当然，帮助落后达到先进的办法是多种多样的。组织同工种工人签订技术互助合同、组织同类企业签订互助合同仅仅是其中的一种。五三工厂深入调查每一个落后的工人所以落后的原因，采用不同的方法教育他们，这也是一个办法。铁路系统和纺织工业系统组织先进生产者到有关企业去巡回表演，这也是一个办法。第一机械工业部组织包括有各方面专家参加的综合工作组，到某些生产不够好的企业去，帮助他们进行全面的、彻底的改革，这也是一个办法。开展同工种竞赛，组织同类型工厂交流经验，同样也是一个办法。另外还有别的办法。我们在这里介绍互助合同的好处，绝不是说其它的办法不好。对于任何一个工业行业和任何一个企业来说，上述各种办法都是可以同时采用的，而且也必须同时采用，互为补充，才能更快地实现共同提高的目的。
