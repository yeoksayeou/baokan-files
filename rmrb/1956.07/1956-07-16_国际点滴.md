    Fallacious Crime Theory
    The U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation recently released a public statement saying that in 1955, there were 2,264,450 serious crimes in the United States, including 6,850 homicides, 19,100 rapes, and 57,490 robberies…
    FBI statistics experts compiled a crime calendar and concluded that crimes such as homicide or rape are related to “hot weather,” making them popular summer crimes. According to this theory, based on the experts’ fallacious arguments, tropical countries should be the countries with the most serious homicide or rape crimes.
    Child Trafficking Rampant
    In many large cities of dollar-worshipping America, child trafficking is a very profitable business.
    Dachael, a female reporter for the Chicago "American," recently posed as a wealthy lady who wanted to adopt a child and specially visited eight child trafficking brokers. According to her published report, it is easy to find sellers, but the price is "slightly expensive." Each child requires a broker's commission of $2,500 to $3,000. It is said that brokers have secret connections with doctors, lawyers, and court officials.

    犯罪妙论
    美国联邦调查局不久以前发表公报说，1955年美国共发生了2，264，450件严重犯罪行为，其中凶杀案6，850件，强奸案19，100件，抢劫案57，490件……
    联邦调查局统计专家编了一份犯罪日历，得出结论说，像凶杀或强奸等罪行和“炎热的气候”有关，这是夏天流行的犯罪行为。按照这种理论，根据专家们的妙论，热带的国家该是凶杀或强奸罪行最严重的国家了。
    贩卖儿童成风
    在金元美国的许多大城市，贩卖儿童是一件很赚钱的生意。
    芝加哥“美国人报”女记者达却尔，最近装做一位想收养孩子的富家太太，特地访问了八个贩卖儿童的掮客。据她发表的消息说，很容易找到卖主，就是价钱“稍贵”，每个小孩，掮客要收佣金二千五百美元至三千美元。据说，掮客们和医生、律师以及法院官员暗中有联系。
