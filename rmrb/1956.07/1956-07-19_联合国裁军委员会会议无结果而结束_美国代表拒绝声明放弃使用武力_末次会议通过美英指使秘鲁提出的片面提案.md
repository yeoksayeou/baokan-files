Xinhua News Agency, TASS, New York, July 17th: The United Nations Disarmament Commission concluded its discussions on July 16th. Disregarding the opposition of the Soviet representative, the meeting ultimately passed a so-called procedural proposal put forward by the Peruvian representative, Belaunde, at the instigation of the British and American representatives. This proposal stipulates that all proposals submitted to the Commission be referred to its subcommittee for discussion.

At the beginning of the Commission's final meeting, it was originally expected that the US representative, Lodge, and the British representative, Nutting, who were to speak first, would respond to the Soviet representative's clear suggestions on issues such as the level of armed forces and the prohibition of nuclear weapons testing. However, what they did was talk about the Western draft resolution of July 3rd.

Lodge said that the Soviet Union's agreement with the level of armed forces of the major powers proposed by the Western countries for the second time was good news, but he also said that the Soviet Union's agreement could only be considered "serious" if the Soviet Union accepted the Western supervision plan, specifically, the aerial inspection plan.

Lodge opposed the Soviet proposal to issue a declaration renouncing the use of force and atomic weapons. His reason was that doing so would deprive Western countries of their means of defense.

Soviet representative Gromyko then responded to the speeches of Lodge and Nutting, saying that the speeches of Lodge and Nutting were very indefinite, unclear, and ambiguous. The question here is whether they are preparing to retreat again in order to reject their own new suggestions on the level of armed forces.

Gromyko said that in discussing disarmament issues, an agreement on conventional armaments should not be made dependent on reaching an agreement on atomic weapons issues, but should be the other way around.

The Soviet representative stated that he did not object to referring the proposals to the Disarmament Subcommittee for discussion. However, the Peruvian proposal is one-sided because, although it suggests that all proposals be referred to the subcommittee for consideration, it only mentions the Western proposals in its preamble without mentioning other proposals. Thus, the Peruvian proposal only reflects the position of the Western countries.

Gromyko said that if an agreement is desired on this proposal, efforts must be made to formulate a proposal that can be accepted by all member states of the committee and reflects the views of all delegations. Passing the Peruvian proposal would be a step backward, and the Soviet delegation cannot accept this one-sided proposal.

Yugoslav representative Ninčić also pointed out the one-sidedness of the Peruvian proposal and urged the committee to find a way to formulate a procedural proposal that could be accepted by everyone.

French representative Moch suggested a temporary recess so that members of the committee could hold an informal meeting to try to reach an agreement on a compromise proposal that could be agreed upon by everyone. However, it was rejected due to the opposition of the British and American representatives.

At the insistence of the US and British representatives, the Peruvian proposal was submitted to a vote. It was passed by a majority vote. In this way, the representatives of the United States and Britain forcibly passed a resolution endorsing their own position. The discussion and passage of this resolution once again proves that the US representative and some other Western representatives are unwilling to seek agreement even on procedural issues concerning disarmament.

    联合国裁军委员会会议无结果而结束
    美国代表拒绝声明放弃使用武力
    末次会议通过美英指使秘鲁提出的片面提案
    据新华社塔斯社纽约17日讯联合国裁军委员会七月十六日结束讨论。会议不顾苏联代表的反对，最后通过了秘鲁代表贝朗德在英美代表授意下提出的一项所谓程序提案，这项提案规定把向委员会提出的一切提案移交给它的小组委员会讨论。
    在委员会末次会议开始时，人们原本期待首先发言的美国代表洛奇和英国代表纳丁答复苏联代表关于武装部队水平、禁止核子武器试验等问题的明确建议。但是，他们所做的却是谈论西方七月三日提出的决议草案。
    洛奇说，苏联同意西方国家第二次提出的大国武装部队水平是一个好消息，但是他又说，只有苏联接受了西方的监督计划，明确地说，就是空中视察计划，苏联的同意才能被认为是“认真的”。
    洛奇反对苏联主张发表宣言放弃使用武力和原子武器的建议。他的理由是这样做会剥夺西方国家的防御手段。
    苏联代表葛罗米柯接着答复洛奇和纳丁的发言，他说，洛奇和纳丁的发言是很不肯定的，不清楚的和模糊的，这里发生了一个问题，他们是否又在准备退回去，以便拒绝自己在武装力量水平问题上的新建议。
    葛罗米柯说，在讨论裁军问题的时候，不应当使关于常规军备的协议取决于原子武器问题的达成协议，而应当相反。
    苏联代表声明，他不反对把各项提案移交给裁军小组委员会讨论。但是，秘鲁的提案是片面的，因为它虽然建议把各种提案都转交小组委员会考虑，可是它在序文里却只提到西方的提案而没有提到其他提案。这样，秘鲁的提案就只是反映了西方国家的立场。
    葛罗米柯说，如果希望就这项提案达成协议，就必须努力拟出一项可以为委员会各成员国所接受，并且反映各国代表团意见的提案。通过秘鲁提案将是倒退一步，苏联代表团不能够接受这项片面的提案。
    南斯拉夫代表宁契奇也指出秘鲁提案的片面性，并且敦促委员会设法拟出一项能够为大家所接受的程序提案。
    法国代表莫克建议暂时休会以便委员会委员们举行一次非正式会议，设法就能够为大家同意的一项折衷提案达成协议。但由于英国和美国代表的反对而被否决。
    在美国和英国代表坚持下，秘鲁提案提交表决。表决时以大多数票通过。这样美国和英国的代表就是强行通过了一个赞同他们自己的立场的决议。这个决议的讨论情况和通过，又一次证明美国代表和某些其他西方国家代表不愿意谋求甚至在关于裁军问题的程序问题上达成协议。
