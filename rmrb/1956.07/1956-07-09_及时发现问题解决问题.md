The Rising Sun Agricultural Cooperative
    Revised Unreasonable Labor Quotas

    Xinhua News Agency: The Rising Sun Agricultural Production Cooperative in Gaiping County, Liaoning Province, promptly revised unreasonable labor quotas in production practice, which improved the enthusiasm of its members.

    This cooperative is a newly established advanced cooperative this year, and it is the first year to fully implement quota management. Due to lack of experience, many quota standards were found to be unrealistic in production practice. Some labor-saving agricultural tasks had excessive labor quotas, while some labor-intensive agricultural tasks had insufficient quotas. When setting the quotas, no distinction was made between distant and near land, good and bad land, mountainous and flat land, or the strength of livestock.

    The unreasonable quota regulations resulted in many negative consequences: members working in distant, bad, and mountainous areas, where labor was more intensive, engaged in rush work and neglected quality in order to complete quotas and earn more work points. At the same time, significant income disparities arose between members: those working on near, good land frequently exceeded quotas and earned more work points, while those working on distant, bad land often failed to complete quotas and earned fewer work points. This greatly affected the labor morale of the members, leading to many complaints.

    After discovering these problems, the cooperative's cadres promptly solicited opinions from members, conducted research, and revised the quotas. The new quota standards were then submitted to the members' representative assembly for thorough discussion. The members unanimously agreed that the new quotas were tailored to local conditions and implemented the principle of "more work, more gain." As a result, their enthusiasm for labor has increased compared to the past. Currently, the attendance rate of all members is above 95% daily, an increase of about 10% compared to before the revision.

Dongting Lake Area Counties
    Solving the Labor Shortage During the "Autumn Rush"

    Xinhua News Agency: Counties, townships, and agricultural production cooperatives in the Dongting Lake area have all formulated labor plans for the "Autumn Rush" (the busy period of harvesting early rice and transplanting late rice) based on specific conditions, in order to solve the problem of insufficient labor.  A careful calculation of labor needs revealed that approximately 100,000 workers could be supported by nearby hilly and mountainous areas, as well as from towns and villages. This will fundamentally solve the problem of labor shortages in the Dongting Lake area during the "Autumn Rush".

    Currently, the CPC Changde Prefectural Committee and relevant counties have established "Summer Harvest and Summer Planting Labor Allocation Offices." Counties in the lake area are signing support contracts with agricultural cooperatives in the hilly and mountainous areas, and some have already arranged food and lodging in preparation for welcoming farmers from the mountains. Agricultural cooperatives in the mountainous areas have also made arrangements and will begin to depart in batches around July 10th to support farmers in the lake area.

    This year, the area planted with double-cropping rice in the Dongting Lake area has increased by more than twofold compared to last year. Early rice is now almost ripe and will be fully harvested in about ten days. Farmers in the lake area have a saying: "Strive for the day in spring, strive for the time in summer; late rice beyond autumn, nine out of ten will have no harvest." Therefore, during the "Autumn Rush" of rushing to harvest early rice and transplant late rice, it is necessary to plan agricultural work and allocate labor comprehensively to catch up with the season and strive for a comprehensive harvest.

Lighthouse First Agricultural Cooperative
    Corrected the Egalitarian Distribution Tendency

    Xinhua News Agency: The Lighthouse First Agricultural Production Cooperative in Dali County, Shaanxi Province, has corrected the egalitarian tendency in the summer harvest distribution, with those who worked more receiving more wheat.

    This cooperative was established as an advanced cooperative last December. A few days ago, when formulating the summer harvest pre-distribution plan, the cooperative cadres, in order to reduce trouble, planned to settle accounts according to the principle of "distribution according to work" during the autumn distribution, and decided to distribute the quota part equally according to the population in the summer harvest pre-distribution, and distribute the excess part equally according to labor.  After this equal distribution plan was set, it caused unease among many members.

    After discovering this situation recently, the CPC Lighthouse First Agricultural Cooperative branch immediately convened the branch committee and the cooperative management committee to study together and criticize this egalitarian distribution ideology. In order to take care of the members with large populations and less labor, and members with less attendance due to other reasons, it was decided to extract a small portion of grain from the total income and pre-distribute it to them in order to solve their living difficulties. The remainder will be pre-distributed in accordance with the principle of "distribution according to work."

    After the cadres unified their thinking, they immediately discussed and revised the original pre-distribution plan in production teams. According to the new plan, members whose income was slightly reduced in the distribution were told that as long as they work more and better in autumn field production and diversified operations, they can completely strive to increase their annual income.

    After these efforts, the members were satisfied, and the attendance rate of many production teams has increased compared to the past. The entire cooperative rushed to plant more than 1,000 mu of late autumn crops in the rain within two days.

    及时发现问题解决问题
    太阳升农业社
    修订了不合理的劳动定额
    新华社讯　辽宁省盖平县太阳升农业生产合作社在生产实践中及时修订不合理的劳动定额，提高了社员的劳动热情。
    这个社是今年新成立的高级社，全面实行定额管理还是头一年。因为缺乏经验，在生产实践中暴露了许多项定额标准定得不切实际。有的省工的农活用工量定得很多；有的费工的农活用工量却定得很少。在制定定额的时候，对远地近地，好地坏地，山地平地，畜力强弱等，都没有加以区别。
    由于定额规定得不合理，便造成了很多坏结果：在远地、坏地和山地等费工较多的地方劳动的社员，为了完成定额，多赚劳动工分，便发生了突击劳动忽视质量的现象。同时，也产生了社员与社员之间收入相差悬殊的情况：在近地、好地劳动的社员经常超过定额，赚的劳动工分也多；而在远地、坏地劳动的社员，却经常完不成定额，赚的劳动工分也就很少。这样，就大大影响了社员的劳动情绪，以致大家意见很多。
    这个社的干部发现这些问题以后，便及时征求社员意见，进行研究，重新修改了定额，并把新的定额标准提交社员代表大会进行了充分的讨论。社员们一致认为这个新定额是因地制宜的，贯彻了多劳多得的原则。因此，劳动热情都比过去提高了。现在，全社社员每天出勤率都在95％以上，比修改以前提高了10％左右。
    洞庭湖滨各县
    解决“赶秋”时期劳力不足问题
    新华社讯　洞庭湖滨各县、各乡、各农业生产合作社为解决赶秋时期（即收早和赶插晚稻的农忙时期）劳力不够的问题，都已经根据具体情况制定了赶秋的劳力规划。对劳力精打细算的结果，由附近丘陵山区和集镇支援约十万个劳动力，湖滨地区赶秋时期劳力不足的问题就可以基本上得到解决。
    现在，中共常德地委会和有关各县都已专门设立了“夏收夏种劳动力调配办公室”。湖区各县正与丘陵山区的农业社签订支援合同，有的已经把食、宿的地方安排好，准备迎接山区农民。山区的农业社也都作了布置，约在七月十日后就可分批启程去支援湖区农民。
    今年，洞庭湖区种双季稻的面积比去年增加两倍多。现在早稻快要黄熟，再过十天左右就将全面收割。湖区农民有句俗话：“春争日，夏争时；晚稻不过秋，过秋十有九无收”。因此，抢收早稻和抢插晚稻的“赶秋”时期，就需要有计划地安排农活和通盘调配劳力，才能赶上季节争取全面丰收。
    灯塔第一农业社
    纠正了平均主义的分配偏向
    新华社讯　陕西省大荔县灯塔第一农业生产合作社纠正了在夏收分配中的平均主义偏向，多劳动的人多得了小麦。
    这个社是在去年十二月成立的高级社。前些天，在制定夏收预分方案的时候，社干部们为了减少麻烦，准备在秋季分配时再根据“按劳取酬”的原则找齐，就决定在夏收预分中，对定产部分按人口平均分配，超产部分按劳动力进行平均分配。这个平均分配的方案定出后，引起许多社员的不安。
    中共灯塔第一农业社分支部在最近发现这种情况后，马上召集支委和社管理委员会的人在一起研究，批判了这种平均主义的分配思想。为了照顾人口多、劳力少和因为其他原因出勤比较少的社员，决定从总收入内抽出很少一部份粮食，多预分给他们，以解决他们的生活困难。其余的一律按照“按劳取酬”的原则预分。
    干部们的思想统一后，便立即以生产队为单位反复讨论和修订了原来的预分方案。根据新方案，在分配中对收入略有减少的社员说明，只要在秋田生产和多种经营中，更多更好地劳动，完全可以争取全年收入增加。
    经过这些工作，社员们满意了，许多生产队的出勤率都比过去有所增加，全社在两天内就冒雨抢种了一千多亩晚秋作物。
