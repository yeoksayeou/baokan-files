    New Type of Floor Slab
    (Our newspaper, Shenyang) The concrete processing factory of the Third Engineering Division of the Northeast Second Engineering Company has successfully trial-produced a standard arched concrete floor slab. This new type of floor slab, although using 55% bamboo reinforcement instead of steel reinforcement, still has a safety factor exceeding general design standards. It is lighter than ordinary reinforced concrete floor slabs, has smaller components, and is easy to install. With the addition of a ceiling, it is very beautiful to paint and suitable for the needs of general civil buildings. Using this type of floor slab in 30,000 square meters of civil buildings can reduce the project cost by about 10%. Now this prefabricated floor slab has begun mass production. (Text)

    新型楼板
    本报沈阳讯　东北第二工程公司第三工程处混凝土加工工厂试制成功一种标准拱形混凝土楼板。这种新式楼板，虽然采用了55％的竹筋代替钢筋，安全系数还是超过一般设计标准。它比一般钢筋混凝土楼板体轻、构件小、安装方便，加上天棚以后，粉刷起来很美观，适合于一般民用建筑的需要。在三万平方公尺的民用建筑上采用这种楼板，可以降低工程造价10％左右。现在这种预制楼板已经开始大批生产。　（文）
