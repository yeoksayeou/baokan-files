Random Thoughts

    A columnist for the "Manila Daily Bulletin" accused the Philippine businessman Cloma, who "discovered" China's Nansha Islands, of being a colonialist "imitator," saying "he must have felt like an old-time colonizer and conqueror."

    This psychological analysis is largely correct. Cloma is suffering from a disease of historical delusion. Colonialism, as of today, has long been at its end. As a Ceylonese newspaper said last year in commenting on the Goa issue, colonialists are only desperately trying to maintain the "fading glory" of a past imperial era. Hundreds of years ago, conquerors, fully armed, relying on fire and sword, and claiming to be executing God's will, swaggered before the slaves, and looked somewhat impressive. But what about this latter-day colonialist Cloma and his ilk? He just held a few mango tree seedlings and a bag of cabbage seeds, secretly climbed onto the beach, snuck into a neighbor's yard, and while scattering the seeds, pointed at the ground under his feet and muttered, "Mine! Mine!" This behavior, where is there any talk of "fading glory"? It's simply the embarrassing exposure of an incompetent thief.

    “马尼拉日报”的专栏作家指责“发现”我国领土南沙群岛的菲律宾商人克洛马为殖民主义的“模仿”者，“他一定有好像是旧时殖民者和征服者的感觉”。
    这种心理分析大致是对的。克洛马害了时代错觉的病症。殖民主义，时至今日，早已走到了穷途末路。正如去年锡兰一家报纸在评果阿问题时说的，殖民者只是拼命想保持过去帝国时代的“雕谢的荣耀”。几百年前，征服者全身披挂，凭着火与剑，自称执行上帝的意志，在奴隶们面前，耀武扬威，多少还像个样儿。可是这位末代殖民者克洛马之流呢？只是捧了几支芒果树秧和一包白菜籽，偷偷地爬上沙滩，掩进邻家院子，就一边撒着菜籽，一边指着脚底下的土地，念念有词道：“我的！我的！”这副行径，哪里还谈得上什么“雕谢的荣耀”？简直是不在行的小偷的出乖露丑而已。
