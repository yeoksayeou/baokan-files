    The Pearl by Tao Ran Pavilion
    You Huihai

    “Tao Ran Pavilion is a famous scenic spot in Beijing, and the Dance School is a pearl by Tao Ran Pavilion.” A comrade once said this to me (the Beijing Dance School is located in Tao Ran Pavilion). This may not be an overstatement of praise; through this internship performance of the Dance School, people can see that the sparkle of this pearl is becoming brighter and brighter, attracting more and more attention and love.

    When the little soldiers supported the little girls, stepping steadily and proudly into the scene to the music of the Mazurka, the audience was moved by their affected solemnity, as if they had been led to the columned hall of the Young Pioneers Palace to participate in their Fir Tree Festival. When that silly, shifty-eyed big radish was pulled up by a group of "little rascals" with concerted effort, this childlike innocence immediately filled the audience's hearts, making them cheer with joy, eager to go backstage immediately to embrace them.

      "Spring Outing" is a noteworthy creation in the internship performance. It creatively developed the formation of Flower Drum Lanterns with outstanding style, giving new life content to this folk traditional dance; I think this is a good example of breaking the conservative thinking in developing folk dance. It’s just that in all the performance programs, there are still too few relatively mature ethnic dance creations like this. However, the young choreographers of the choreography training class have made up for this deficiency with their large number of new modern-themed works.

    Those heroes and brave figures who were once admired by the people—like Liu Hulan, volunteer heroes, and patriotic people—have already appeared as prominent images in the works of young choreographers. Their creative experiments have given the works the intimate life atmosphere of our era. Although there are still some problems to be solved in these modern-themed creations, such as the application of national vocabulary and style, we can be sure that they have already shaped some prototypes of modern-themed dance dramas.

    Immediately following the impressions of the mysterious Arabian Nights, the fiery and passionate Spanish Dance, the Coppélia in the toy store, the Shepherd Boy and other ballet programs, the last thing we see is the classical grand waltz in "Sleeping Beauty," which allows the audience to appreciate a dance scene from a large-scale ballet. I can't help but think: It will not be long before we see Chinese actors performing complete and exquisite ballets in our theaters.

    Dance art is a moving undertaking. On the stage, its creative and imaginative realm is very broad, and all the achievements of the Dance School make us see the beautiful prospects of our cause more clearly.

    Let us start our fantasy of the future cause from here:——

    In 196X, on a snowy winter evening, a large group of audience members gathered in front of the Capital Dance Theater, and neon lights shone on the posters of dance dramas that were staged in rotation this season—"The White Haired Girl," "Across Ten Thousand Waters and a Thousand Mountains," "Motherland," "Morning on Mount Everest," "The Tale of the White Snake," "Qu Yuan," "Swan Lake," "The Fountain," "The Nutcracker"...

    After the audience breathlessly listened to the overture of the dance drama "Loyal Prince Li Xiucheng," the stage curtain slowly rose. ...

    陶然亭畔的明珠
    游惠海
    “陶然亭是北京的名胜，而舞蹈学校是陶然亭畔的一颗明珠。”（北京舞蹈学校的校址在陶然亭），一位同志曾经这样对我说。这不会是过甚其词的颂扬；通过这一次舞蹈学校的实习演出，人们可以看到，这颗明珠的闪光，越来越明亮，越来越引起人们的重视和热爱了。
    当小军人们搀着小姑娘们，在玛祖卡的乐曲中稳步昂然地出场时，观众就被他们煞有介事的庄重打动了，好像被引到了少先宫的圆柱大厅去参加他们的枞树节。当那个傻气的、眼睛溜来溜去的大萝卜，被一群“小淘气”齐心合力一拔而起时，这种童年的天真立即注满了观众的内心，乐得欢叫起来，恨不得马上到后台去拥抱他们。
      “游春”是实习演出中引人注意的一个创作，它以出色的格调创造地发展了花鼓灯的形成，给了这个民间传统舞蹈新的生活内容；我觉得这是打破发展民间舞蹈上的保守思想的好实例。只是在全部演出节目中，像这样比较成熟的民族舞蹈创作还是太少些。但是，编导训练班年青的编导们却以他们大量新的现代题材的习作弥补了这方面的不足。
    那些曾经为人们敬仰的英雄和勇敢的人物——像刘胡兰、志愿军英雄、爱国的人民，已经作为作品的凸出的形象，出现在年青的编导的习作中了。他们的创作试验，使作品产生了我们这个时代的亲切的生活气息。尽管这些现代题材的创作，还存在一些像运用民族语汇和风格的问题需要解决；但是，我们完全可以肯定，他们已经塑造了一些现代题材舞剧的雏形了。
    紧接着那神秘的阿拉伯之夜、火辣热情的西班牙舞、玩具店里的阔别利亚、牧童等芭蕾舞节目的印象，最后让我们看到的是“睡美人”中的古典大华尔兹舞，这个节目让观众欣赏到一出大型的芭蕾舞剧的舞蹈场面。不禁使我想起：在我们的剧院中，出现中国演员演出的整出精湛的芭蕾舞剧，已经不会是很远以后的事情了。
    舞蹈艺术是一门动人的事业。在舞台上，它的创造和幻想的意境是非常广阔的，而舞蹈学校的一切成就，使我们更清楚地看到了我们事业的美丽的远景。
    让我们对未来的事业的幻想，从这里开始吧：——
    一九六×年，一个冬天下雪的傍晚，首都舞剧院的门前聚集着大群准备入场的观众，霓虹灯闪耀着并列在一起的、这一季节轮换上演的舞剧剧目海报——“白毛女”“万水千山”“祖国”“珠穆朗玛峰的早晨”“白蛇传”“屈原”“天鹅湖”“喷泉”“胡桃夹子”……
    观众屏息地听完了舞剧“忠王李秀成”的序曲之后，舞台的大幕徐徐上升。……
