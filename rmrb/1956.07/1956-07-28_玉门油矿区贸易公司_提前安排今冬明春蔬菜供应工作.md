Yumen Oil Mining Area Trading Company
    Makes Early Arrangements for Vegetable Supply for This Winter and Next Spring
    (Our report) The Yumen Oil Mining Area Trading Company in Gansu Province has made specific plans and made early arrangements for the supply of vegetables for the second half of this year and before April next year.
    The number of personnel in the Yumen mining area is constantly increasing. The supply of vegetables in the second half of last year and the first quarter of this year was insufficient and the variety was not large. This year, the trading company has signed purchase contracts with agricultural cooperatives in Jiuquan County, Jinta County, and Baiyanghe in Yumen County. In addition, as the train goes to Yumen, it is also planned to purchase fresh vegetables such as garlic sprouts, tomatoes, cucumbers, and eggplants from Guangdong, Guangxi, and other provinces.
    The source of goods that has been organized so far exceeds the previous supply. According to statistics, the planned reserve from November this year to April next year will increase by about 44% compared with the supply for the whole year last year. It is estimated that each employee (including children) can be supplied with twelve taels per day when vegetables are in short supply in winter and spring.
    In order to do a good job in the supply of winter vegetables, the Gansu Provincial Trading Company requires the Yumen Mining Area Trading Company to equip a certain amount of manpower to do a good job in transportation, supply, storage, and processing. In addition, the Yumen Trading Company has also entrusted agricultural cooperatives in Jiuquan and other places, and the Yumen Mining Bureau to store a portion of vegetables, and is starting to build another 3,000 square meters of vegetable cellars on the basis of the original 1,000 square meters of vegetable cellars. In addition, two greenhouses have been set up in Yumen city.

    玉门油矿区贸易公司
    提前安排今冬明春蔬菜供应工作
    本报讯　甘肃省玉门油矿区贸易公司，作出了具体的规划，提前安排今年下半年和明年四月份以前的蔬菜供应工作。
    玉门矿区人员不断增多，去年下半年和今年第一季度蔬菜供应不足，品种不多。今年贸易公司和酒泉县、金塔县、玉门县白杨河等地农业社订立了收购合同。此外，由于火车通向玉门，也准备在广东、广西等省购买新鲜蔬菜蒜苔、番茄、黄瓜、茄子等供应。
    目前已经组织好的货源，都超过以往供应量，据统计从今年十一月份到明年四月计划储备量约比去年全年供应量增大44％。估计每个职工（包括小孩）在冬、春蔬菜缺少的时候，每天可供应十二两。
    为作好冬季蔬菜供应工作，甘肃省贸易公司要求玉门矿区贸易公司配备一定力量，作好调运、供应、储藏、加工等工作。此外，玉门贸易公司也委托酒泉等地农业社、玉门矿务局储存一部分蔬菜，并在原有菜窖一千平方公尺基础上，着手再修建三千平方公尺菜窖。另外，还在玉门市区设置了两处温室。
