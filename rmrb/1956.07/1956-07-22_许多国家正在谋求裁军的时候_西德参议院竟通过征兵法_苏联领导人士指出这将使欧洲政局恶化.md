Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, July 21st: Bonn dispatch: The West German Senate, composed of representatives from West German state governments, passed the Adenauer government's conscription bill on July 20th in a tense atmosphere.

Of the representatives from the nine state governments in West Germany, only twenty-one votes from five states were in favor, while seventeen votes from four states were against. These four states are North Rhine-Westphalia (the state where the Ruhr industrial area is located), Bavaria, Hesse, and Bremen, all of which are led by Social Democratic Party-formed state governments. North Rhine-Westphalia and Bavaria are the two most populous states in West Germany.

Representatives from the states opposing the conscription bill, in their speeches, emphasized the fact that many countries, including some NATO members, are considering reducing their armed forces. Bavarian Premier and Social Democrat, Högner, said during the debate: "Everywhere in the world, we see increasingly strong efforts being made for disarmament, but West Germany is preparing to implement conscription." He pointed out that "there is a danger here that the reunification of Germany will become more difficult due to conscription."

The bill passed by the Senate will take effect after the President signs it.

Xinhua News Agency, July 21st: According to TASS, Moscow, July 20th: Soviet leaders issued a statement on July 20th regarding the recent passage of the universal military service law by the West German Federal Parliament, stating: The implementation of universal military service in West Germany will undoubtedly worsen the European political situation and further complicate the resolution of the German question. This step forces countries bordering Germany to be vigilant. These countries will never forget that both World Wars experienced by mankind were launched by German militarists.

The statement said: Just as the governments of many countries are busy looking for constructive ways to disarm, and just as various countries have already begun to reduce their armed forces, the Federal Republic of Germany is preparing the conditions for establishing the largest army in Western Europe. This is particularly worrying.

The statement said that recently, the government of the German Democratic Republic has announced that it will reduce its army by 30,000 troops and has expressed that it will not implement conscription. Despite this, West Germany passed the conscription law, a practice that violates the wishes of the German people. The West German Social Democratic Party and many other parties and groups oppose the implementation of the conscription law, believing that it will delay the reunification of Germany and further complicate this issue. The current government of the Federal Republic of Germany must be held responsible for this.

    许多国家正在谋求裁军的时候
    西德参议院竟通过征兵法
    苏联领导人士指出这将使欧洲政局恶化
    新华社柏林21日电　波恩消息：由西德各州政府代表组成的西德参议院七月二十日在紧张的空气中通过了阿登纳政府的征兵法案。
    在西德的九个州政府的代表中，投赞成票的只有五个州的二十一票，投反对票的有四个州的十七票。这四个州是由社会民主党领导组成州政府的北莱因—威斯特伐利亚州（鲁尔工业区所在州）、巴伐利亚州、黑森州和不来梅州。北莱因—威斯特伐利亚州和巴伐利亚州是西德人口最多的两个州。
    反对征兵法案的各个州的代表在发言中，强调指出了许多国家包括一些北大西洋集团国家都在考虑裁减军队的事实。巴伐利亚州总理、社会民主党人赫格纳在辩论时说：“在世界各地，我们看到为裁军而作的努力日益坚强，但是西德却在准备实行征兵。”他指出，这里“存在着这样一个危险：德国的重新统一将由于征兵而变得更加困难。”
    参议院通过的这个法案将在总统签字以后生效。
    新华社21日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科二十日讯：苏联领导人士七月二十日就西德联邦议院最近通过实行普遍兵役法的问题发表声明说：西德实行普遍兵役，这无疑地会使欧洲政治局势更加恶化，会使德国问题的解决更加复杂化。这一步骤使得同德国接壤的国家不能不提高警惕。这些国家永远不会忘记，人类经历的两次世界大战都是德国军国主义者发动的。
    声明说：正当许多国家的政府忙着寻找裁军的建设性方法的时候，正当各个国家已经开始裁减自己的武装部队的时候，德意志联邦共和国却在为建立西欧最大的一支军队准备条件。这就使人特别感到忧虑。
    声明说，最近，德意志民主共和国政府已经宣布要裁军三万人，并且表示不实行征兵。尽管如此，西德还是通过了征兵法，这种做法是违反德国人民的愿望的。西德社会民主党和其他许多党派和团体都反对实行征兵法，它们认为，实行征兵法会推迟德国的重新统一，使这个问题更加复杂化。德意志联邦共和国现政府必须对此负责。
