Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, July 10th: The results of the Japanese Upper House election were fully announced this afternoon. Left-wing parties won more than one-third of the seats, thwarting the ruling Liberal Democratic Party's plan to seize two-thirds of the seats in the election to revise the constitution.

The Japanese House of Councillors has 250 seats, with half being re-elected every three years. In addition to the re-election, there were also by-elections for two vacant seats this time.

The Socialist Party, the Communist Party, and independents who oppose revising the constitution and rearmament made progress. Including the seats that were not up for re-election, they won a total of eighty-six seats.

The conservative camp suffered losses in the election. The Liberal Democratic Party, which was一心 (yīxīn, wholeheartedly) trying to obtain two-thirds of the seats, only retained its sixty-one seats that were up for re-election. Adding the sixty-one seats not up for re-election, it still only occupies one hundred and twenty-two seats, far behind the two-thirds of all seats (one hundred and sixty-seven seats) required to revise the constitution. At the same time, the Ryokufukai, which supports the Liberal Democratic Party, suffered a crushing defeat. Only five of its members were elected, a decrease of twelve seats from before. Including the members not up for re-election, it only has thirty-one seats left.

The Socialist Party achieved significant results in the election, with a total of forty-nine members elected, an increase of twelve seats compared to before the election. Adding the thirty-one members not up for re-election, it currently occupies eighty seats in the House of Councillors.

Japanese Communist Party First Secretary Sanzo Nosaka and former Councilor Masao Iwama were elected. Before the election, the Communist Party only had one seat in the House of Councillors. According to the Associated Press, in this election, the Japanese Communist Party's votes increased from 558,000 in the 1953 House of Councillors election to 1,149,000, second only to the post-war highest number of votes received in the 1949 House of Representatives election when thirty-five members were elected. The Labor-Farmer Party lost its original two seats in this election.

Socialist Party Chairman Mosaburo Suzuki said this afternoon that the election results clearly show that the Japanese people oppose the conservative parties and the United States rearming Japan. Socialist Party members believe that this victory proves that the policy based on neutrality, opposition to rearmament, friendship with China and the Soviet Union, and the abolition of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" is correct.

Liberal Democratic Party Secretary-General Nobusuke Kishi said: "It must be admitted that the Socialist Party has won. This defeat (of the Liberal Democratic Party) makes it difficult to revise (the constitution) in the next two or three years."

Tokyo stock prices fell by one to five yen yesterday. Kyodo News reported that the Japanese business community expressed great disappointment that the Socialist Party had secured one-third of the seats, making it impossible for the conservative parties to propose constitutional revisions in both houses of parliament. Taiso Ishizaka, chairman of the Japan Federation of Economic Organizations, and others admitted that the Japanese people's distrust is entirely directed at the conservative parties and that the people are demanding that the Liberal Democratic Party conduct a deep reflection.

    日本参议员选举结果揭晓
    左翼党派取得三分之一以上席位
    日共得票显著增加　野坂参三和岩间正男当选
    新华社10日讯　东京消息：日本参议员选举结果今天下午已经全部揭晓。左翼党派取得三分之一以上的议席，挫败了执政的自由民主党企图在选举中攫取三分之二的议席来修改宪法的计划。
    日本参议院共有二百五十席，每三年改选一半。这次除了改选以外，还补选缺额两席。
    反对修改宪法和重新武装的社会党、共产党和独立人士，取得了进展。包括未改选的席位在内，它们总共获得了八十六席。
    保守阵营在选举中遭到失利。一心想取得三分之二议席的自由民主党只是保持了它的改选的六十一个席位。加上未改选的六十一席。它依然只占有一百二十二席。远远落后于修改宪法所必须的全部三分之二的议席（一百六十七席）。同时，支持自由民主党的绿风会遭到惨败。它只有五人当选，比原来减少了十二席。包括未改选的议员在内，只剩下三十一席。
    社会党在选举中取得了显著的成果，共有四十九人当选，比选举前增加了十二席。加上未改选的三十一名议员，它目前在参议院占有八十席。
    日本共产党第一书记野坂参三和前参议员岩间正男当选。而在选举以前，共产党在参议院只有一席，据合众社报道，在这次选举中，日本共产党获得的选票从1953年参议员选举中得到的五十五万八千票增加为一百一十四万九千票，仅次于1949年曾有三十五人当选的众议员选举中得到的战后最多的票数。劳农党在这次选举中失去了原有的两个议席。
    社会党主席铃木茂三郎今天下午发表谈话说，这次选举结果清楚地表明，日本人民反对保守政党和美国重新武装日本。社会党人士认为，这次胜利证明了以中立、反对重新武装、同中国和苏联等国友好和废除日美“安全条约”为基础的政策是正确的。
    自由民主党干事长岸信介说：“必须承认社会党得胜了。（自由民主党的）这一失败使得在今后两三年内修改（宪法）的事情困难了”。
    东京的股票价格在昨天下跌了一到五日元。共同社报道说，日本实业界由于社会党确保了三分之一的议席，以致保守政党在参众两院都不能提议修改宪法，表示非常失望。日本经济团体联合会会长石坂泰三等人承认，日本国民不信任的情绪完全针对保守政党。国民要求自由民主党进行深刻的反省。
