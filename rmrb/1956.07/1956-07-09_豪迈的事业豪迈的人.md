    A Grand Undertaking, Grand People
    By our special correspondent, Han Beiping
    If we compare the clamor of a large industrial base to a magnificent symphony, we can already hear its beautiful sounds hundreds of miles away from the Yumen Oil Mine. If we compare a large industrial base to a fiercely burning furnace, we can already feel its heat hundreds of miles away from the Yumen Oil Mine.
    When the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway was laid to Qingshui, I saw a vivid and magnificent picture: on one side were the tall and upright Qilian Mountains, with the white snow on the peaks contrasting with the deep blue sky; on the other side was the desolate and vast Gobi Desert, surprisingly flat. Right in this place, a continuous line of tents was pitched, and gleaming oil depots were erected. Countless cars, like leaping lions dragging tails of dust, sped along the highways and gravel roads. The long whistles of trains, the noise of machines, the neighing of horses, and the shouts of people were interwoven into an indistinguishable clamor. Perhaps only when the Gobi Desert was still an ocean could there have been comparable excitement.
    People came in a hurry, and left in a hurry. They spoke in dialects from all over the country, carrying local products from their hometowns in their baggage, boasting about the beauty of their hometowns, and also admiring the greatness of the motherland. Over there was an oil mine worker who had just returned from attending the National Conference of Advanced Producers, the commemorative badge on his chest shining, bringing the care of the capital to the mountains and basins; over here was a group of girls from southern China, asking people about the winter temperature in the Jiuquan Basin; over there was a young man from Guangdong, sitting on his luggage, quietly reading "Tikhonov's Poetry Collection"; over here was a group of women from Shandong, teasing a young woman traveling with them, whose husband was a labor model at the oil mine, and she should be proud, but in front of the older women, she blushed. When the stationmaster of the long-distance bus station, holding a loudspeaker, shouted, "Passengers for bus number one, please board!" the station was noisy, and when he shouted, "Passengers for bus number eleven, please board!" the station was still noisy. So many people, so many cars! Coming from all directions, going to one place.
    This is the scene hundreds of miles away from the Yumen Oil Mine. The closer you get to the mining area, the more you feel how powerful the pulse of the great industrial base is beating.
    Still the Gobi Desert, the desolate Gobi Desert, but the cars on the road are just like on the western outskirts of Beijing, one after another: cars carrying people, cars transporting machines and daily necessities, cars transporting grain, vegetables, and empty oil drums, and horse-drawn carts and camel caravans, heading towards the oil mine; while cars full of crude oil and gasoline are rushing out of the oil mine.
    Twenty years ago, the location of the Yumen Oil Mine only had a small Lao Jun Temple, some narrow cave dwellings on the hillside, and a few gold prospectors crawling like insects on the river bank, extracting tiny grains of gold from huge amounts of sand and gravel. Besides that, there was endless Gobi, endless silence. Seven years ago, there were only a few oil wells, a dilapidated oil refinery, and a few decent buildings, one of which was a villa reserved for Americans. The workers lived in low earthen houses and cave dwellings, thick black smoke filled the sky, they breathed black air, the raindrops that fell were also black, and white clothes quickly turned black. The entire mining area seemed to be trapped in an endless and ceaseless fire. Now? The mining area is a beautiful city, the air is fresh, and girls and children in colorful clothes walk like butterflies in the lush poplar forests; on the straight and wide asphalt roads, beautiful buses and cars speed by; rows of exquisite houses are distributed on both sides of the city's main roads, which are residences, office buildings, department stores, cinemas, and canteens. The workers going to and from work, wearing silver aluminum helmets and work clothes, are full of vigor, just like teams of brave soldiers. Derricks stand tall on the hillside, and oil flows through underground arteries to the oil depot. At night, the lights of the city and the construction site, some like the Milky Way, some like the Big Dipper, scattered on the hillside in strings of lights, creating new constellations in the night sky.
    It is people who have turned the Gobi Desert into a beautiful city and excavated the underground resources.
    People conquered nature; people forced the Gobi to yield its wealth; people's labor is for the first time truly respected.
    Speaking of the people of the Yumen Oil Mine, they are praiseworthy citizens, good sons and daughters of the new China. Countless people, from engineers to workers, from old men in their sixties to young men in their teens, each has a different experience, but they share a common honor. Their lives spark with fire in labor.
    Among the tens of thousands of employees of the Yumen Oil Mine, some have worked as long as the history of the Yumen Oil Mine; some have grown with the oil mine's growth; and some have spent half their lives in the dark years, only to gain a glorious life after liberation. These veteran workers have one thing in common: a love for work. The oil mine is their home, young apprentices and newcomers are like their children, and labor is as indispensable as air. Sometimes they stand on the hillside and look down, seeing the city expanding day by day, the number of derricks increasing day by day, seeing the magnificent equipment of the oil refinery, and seeing many people who call them master, how can they not be happy?
    Xu Zhenjiu, an old worker at the oil mine's hydroelectric plant, is sixty-six years old this year. More than thirty years ago, right after the October Revolution, he once served in the Soviet Far East Red Army and defended the first socialist country with the Soviet soldiers; he also made many contributions to the work of the oil mine. From 1952 to 1956, he was named a labor model for four consecutive years; this June, his name was again on the list of excellent Party members commended by the oil mine's Party Congress. Being old, the leadership has repeatedly advised him to retire, but he resolutely refused. When talking to me, when mentioning retirement, he said: "I'm not sick or in pain, why should I retire? Let those fifth-grade and sixth-grade workers come and compare with me, I won't be vague!" His tone was full of the working class's pride and sense of responsibility.
    Another old worker, Tao Fuxing, is an internship instructor at the drilling technician school. Twenty years ago, he followed the late geologist Sun Jianchu, carrying bags and surveying scales, climbing mountains and wading through rivers, looking for stones in the Qilian Mountains and the Gobi Desert, studying the secrets underground. At that time, he had no knowledge of oil at all. He once said to Sun Jianchu: "You like these stones, wouldn't it be better to carry hundreds of pounds back in one trip? Why walk so many unnecessary roads every day?" Tao Fuxing laughed heartily when he mentioned his naive words back then, never thinking that his advancing footprints at that time were precisely the advancing footprints of China's petroleum industry. He never thought that he would become China's first generation of oil workers, drilling the first oil well (which is still producing oil to this day); then he drilled more than thirty oil wells; and trained several batches of apprentices, and is still training the latest generation of young people.
    The young workers and young engineers of the Yumen Oil Mine are also unforgettable.
    I met Sun Wenbin, a young technician at the oil refinery, who is not yet nineteen years old this year. On the wall next to his bed, he hung two certificates of merit, a large silk red flower, and three New Year pictures of chubby babies. He said: "Babies love babies!" On the bookshelf by the bed, there are technical books such as "Petroleum Primary Distillation Equipment Operation Reader" and "Petroleum Engineering," as well as thrillers such as "Military Secrets." He, a young man who just came out of the countryside, was still a small correspondent a year ago, and a year later he passed the exam to become a fourth-grade technician. Currently, he has a grand plan to reach the level of an engineer within ten years. What kind of power is supporting Sun Wenbin? It is the lofty aspiration to build socialism. When he was the captain of the Young Pioneers in a primary school in his hometown of Shaanxi, his young mind had already flown to the booming large industrial base. Later, in the organizational life of the Youth League and the organizational life of the Party, this aspiration became more and more firm.
    Among the young engineers, we also see a new type of person, whose path has been slightly more tortuous.
    The Yumen Oil Mine undoubtedly has great attraction in the minds of young people, especially in the minds of young people studying in professional schools and departments. However, the legend of the desolation of the Northwest also causes many people to be wary, wanting to go but afraid to go. Xie Suzhen, the current deputy section chief of the technical section of the Yumen Oil Mine Refinery, is a person who hesitated on this issue. She originally studied in the petroleum department of Yenching University and Tsinghua University. When she graduated from university in 1952, she had to fill out a volunteer form. At this time, she hesitated: if she wanted to do petroleum work, she would of course have to go to the Northwest; but if she went, she would be a little scared. They imagined the Northwest as a very scary place, with nothing, and only one "wind" blowing every year - blowing from the first day of the lunar new year to the lunar new year's eve. They bought a lot of toothpaste, daily necessities, and windproof glasses, and came to the Yumen Oil Mine with a "tragic mood." On the day they arrived, some female classmates didn't even want to open their bedding, and they thought of the poetic life in Tsinghua Garden. In order to pursue "warmth," they started chatting with people from Beijing, chatting about school life, chatting about movies, chatting about dancing; when working, they were either singing, eating, or telling jokes, making a mess; the numbers assigned to them for statistics were either missing a zero or had an extra zero. ...
    Real life is harsh. When a person truly throws himself into life and participates in the struggle, he slowly understands the true meaning of labor, understands the relationship between people, understands the joy of completing tasks, and the distress of not completing tasks; understands what is happiness, and what is the grand future of young people. Xie Suzhen has only been at the oil mine for four years, and she has been promoted to engineer and assumed an important position. There are very many young technicians and workers like her at the oil mine.
    Don't think that life in the Gobi Desert is boring, don't think that the work of drilling, extracting, and refining petroleum is monotonous. If you come to the Yumen Oil Mine, the huge industrial scale will inspire you; the fiery labor and struggle will excite you. What is the wind and sand in the Gobi Desert, and what is the snow and cold of the Qilian Mountains! The people who live and work here have lofty ambitions and happy feelings. Let's take a look, an oil production worker is a loyal reader of Chekhov's works, and he has read almost all of the Chinese translations. An engineer's scientific advancement plan includes two major projects: petroleum expertise and poetry! A young university graduate is determined to obtain a associate doctorate degree within seven years. A drilling team leader, who has trained dozens of team leaders, drillers, and drilling workers in the past, will train one hundred and three team leaders, drillers, and drilling workers this year alone, expanding one drilling team to four and a half drilling teams to meet the needs of the country. A housewife can pass the exam to become a fifth-grade car driver in a short period of time and become the captain of the motorcade. An ordinary worker, upon hearing that a large oil field was discovered in Karamay, Xinjiang, couldn't sleep all night and prepared to go to support it. ... What heroism this is!
    Grand undertaking, grand people!

    豪迈的事业豪迈的人
    本报特约记者　韩北屏
    如果把大工业基地的喧声比做雄浑的合奏，我们在离开玉门油矿几百里的地方，已经听到它美妙的声音；如果把大工业基地比做烈焰飞腾的熔炉，我们在离开玉门油矿几百里的地方，已经感觉到它的灼热。
    当兰新铁路铺轨到清水，我看到了一幅鲜明壮丽的图景：一边是高龄而挺拔的祁连山，山峰上皑皑的白雪，衬着深邃的蓝天；一边是荒凉辽阔的戈壁滩，平坦到使人吃惊。就在这个地方，扎下了连绵的帐篷，竖立了亮晶晶的油库；数不清的汽车，像暴跳的狮子拖着尘土的尾巴，在公路上和砂石地上飞奔。火车汽笛的长鸣，机器的喧声，马的嘶鸣，人群的呼喊，交织成一片难以辨别的喧哗。大概在戈壁滩还是海洋的时候，才有过可以比拟的热闹。
    人们匆忙地来了，又匆忙地走了。他们说着各地的方言，包袱里还带着家乡的土产，互相夸耀故乡的美好，同时也互相赞叹祖国的伟大。那边是刚刚出席全国先进生产者会议归来的油矿工人，胸前的纪念章闪耀着，把首都的关怀带到群山中和盆地里；这边是来自江南的一群姑娘们，向人们打听酒泉盆地的冬天气温；那边一个广东青年，坐在行李卷上，悄悄读着“吉洪诺夫诗集”；这边一群山东来的妇女，向一位同行的少妇打趣，她的丈夫是油矿上的劳动模范，她正应该骄傲，可是在大婶大嫂面前，却羞得满脸通红。长途汽车站的站长，拿着喇叭筒，高呼：“第一号车的旅客请上车！”的时候，车站上喧闹着，当他喊出：“第十一号车的旅客请上车！”之后，车站上还是喧闹着。多少人，多少车子啊！从各个地方来，向一个地方去。
    这是离开玉门油矿百里以外地方的景象。越接近矿区，就越感到大业基地的脉搏跳动有多么强大。
    还是戈壁滩，荒凉的戈壁滩，可是公路上的汽车，简直像在北京西郊公路上，一辆接着一辆：载人的汽车，运送机器和日用品的汽车，运送粮食、菜蔬和空油桶的汽车、马车和骆驼队，奔向油矿；而满载原油、汽油的汽车，又从油矿奔出来。
    二十年前，玉门油矿的所在地，只有一座矮小的老君庙，山坡上有些狭窄的窑洞，少数淘金的人们，像爬虫似地匍匐在河边上，从巨量的沙石中，淘取微小的金粒，此外就是无穷无尽的戈壁，无穷无尽的死寂。七年前，这里也只有几口油井，一座残破的炼油厂，几幢比较像样的房子，其中一幢别墅，却是给美国人预备的。工人们住在低矮的土房子和窑洞中，浓重的黑烟弥漫天空，呼吸的是黑色空气，落下的雨点也是黑色的，白衣服很快就变成黑衣服，整个矿区仿佛陷在一场无尽无休的大火灾的包围中。现在呢？矿区是美丽的城市，空气清新，穿花衣服的姑娘和孩子们，像蝴蝶似地穿行在苍翠的白杨林子里；笔直宽广的柏油马路上，漂亮的公共汽车、小轿车疾驰而过；一排排精致的房子，分布在市内干道的两边，那是住宅、办公大楼、百货公司、电影院和食堂。上班下班的工人，头戴银色的铝盔、身穿工作服，精神抖擞，简直像一队队勇敢的战士。井架耸立在山坡上，石油通过埋藏在地下的动脉流向油库。到晚上，市区和工地的灯火，有的像银河，有的像大熊星，散布在山坡上的一串串灯光，创造了夜空中新的星座。
    把戈壁滩变成美丽的城市，把地下的蕴藏发掘出来的，是人。
    人，征服了自然；人，迫使戈壁献出了财富；人的劳动，第一次受到真正的尊敬。
    说到玉门油矿的人，那是值得夸赞的公民，新中国的好儿女。无数的人，从工程师到工人，从六十多岁的老人到十几岁的小伙子，他们各人有一段不同的经历，却有着共同的荣誉。他们的生命在劳动中迸射出火花。
    在玉门油矿几万个职工中间，有些人的工龄和玉门油矿的历史一般长；有些人和油矿的成长一同成长；有些人在黑暗的岁月中度过半生，解放后才获得光辉的生命。这些老工人，有一个共同的特点，便是对工作的热爱。油矿是他们的家，年轻的徒弟和新来的人，仿佛是他们的子弟，劳动是和空气一样的不可缺少。他们有时候站在山岗上朝下望，看到一天比一天扩展的市区，一天比一天增多的井架，看到炼油厂雄伟的设备，看到许多叫他们做师傅的人，他们哪能不高兴呢。
    油矿水电厂的老工人许振久，今年六十六岁。三十多年前，正当十月革命之后，他曾经一度在苏联远东红军中服务，和苏军战士一同捍卫过第一个社会主义国家；在油矿的工作上，也作了不少贡献。从1952年到1956年，连续四年被评为劳动模范；今年六月，油矿党代表会通过表扬优秀党员的名单中，又有了他的名字。年纪大了，领导上几次劝他退休，他坚决拒绝。和我谈话时，提到退休的事情，他说：“我没病没痛，干吗要退休？叫那些五级、六级的工人来和我比一比，我才不含糊！”语气里充满了工人阶级的自豪感和责任感。
    另一个老工人陶福兴，是钻井技工学校的实习教员。二十年前，他跟随已故地质学家孙健初背口袋、扛表尺，攀山涉水，在祁连山和戈壁滩上找石头，研究地下的秘密。那时候，他根本没有石油的知识，他曾经对孙健初说：“你喜欢这些石头，一趟搬回去几百斤不好吗？为什么天天走这许多冤枉路。”陶福兴提到当年天真幼稚的说话，呵呵地大笑起来，想不到当时自己前进的脚印，正是中国石油工业前进的脚印。想不到自己会成为中国第一代的石油工人，打了第一口油井（到现在还在喷油哩）；接着又打了三十多口油井；培养了好几批的徒弟，现在还在培养着最新一代的青年。
    玉门油矿的青年工人和青年工程师，也是令人难以忘怀的。
    我遇见过炼油厂的青年技工孙文彬，今年还不到十九岁。他的床边墙壁上，挂了两张奖状，一朵绢制大红花，又挂了三张胖娃娃的年画，他说：“娃娃爱娃娃哩！”床头书架上，放着“石油初馏设备操作读本”，“石油工学”等技术书，还有“军事秘密”那一类的惊险小说。他，一个刚从农村出来的小伙子，一年前还是小通讯员，一年后就考上四级技工了。目前，他有一个远大的计划，要在十年内达到工程师的水平。是一种什么力量在支持孙文彬呢？是建设社会主义的崇高志愿。当他在陕西家乡的小学中当少先队大队长时，幼小的心灵已经飞向轰轰烈烈的大工业基地，以后在团的组织生活、党的组织生活中，这种志愿愈来愈坚定了。
    在青年工程师中间，我们还看到一种新型的人物，他们走过的道路，稍微曲折些。
    玉门油矿，在青年们的心目中，尤其在专业学校、专业科系学习的青年心目中，毫无疑问有极大的吸引力。可是，西北荒凉的传说，又使不少人产生戒惧，想去又怕去。现任玉门油矿炼油厂技术科副科长的谢苏珍，便是在这个问题上徘徊过的人。她原是在燕京大学、清华大学读石油系的，1952年大学毕业了，要填写志愿书，这时，她彷徨起来：干石油工作嘛，当然要到西北去；去呢，又有点儿恐惧。她们把西北设想为非常可怕的地方，什么东西也没有，每年只刮“一场风”——从年初一刮到除夕。她们买了很多条牙膏、日用品和防风眼镜，以“悲壮的心情”来到玉门油矿。刚到的那天，有些女同学连铺盖也不想打开，她们想起清华园里诗一般的生活。她们为了追求“温暖”，碰到北京来的人就聊开了，聊学校生活，聊电影，聊跳舞；工作的时候不是唱歌，吃东西，就是说笑话，闹成一片；分配她们统计的数目字，不是少一个圈儿，就是多一个圈儿。……
    现实生活是严峻的，一个人真正投进了生活，参预了斗争，就慢慢的体会劳动的真义，体会人与人之间的关系，体会完成任务时的愉快，完不成任务时的苦恼；体会什么是幸福，什么是青年人的远大前程。谢苏珍来到油矿仅仅四年，她升任了工程师，担任了重要的职务。像她一样的青年技术员和工人，在油矿上是非常之多的。
    别以为戈壁滩上的生活枯燥，别以为石油的钻、采、炼的工作单调。你如果来到玉门油矿，巨大的工业规模，将使你受到鼓舞；火热的劳动和斗争，将使你激动。戈壁滩上的风沙，算得了什么，祁连山的积雪和严寒，又算得了什么！在这里生活着和劳动着的人们，自有远大的抱负，幸福的感情。我们看看吧，一个采油工人，是契呵夫作品的忠实读者，所有的中译本，他几乎全读过。一个工程师的科学进军计划中，包括两大项目：石油专业和诗！一个年轻的大学毕业生，决心在七年内取得副博士学位。一个钻井队长，过去已经培养了几十个队长、司钻、钻工，今年一年内，更要培养一百零三个队长、司钻、钻工，使一个井队扩大到四个半井队，来适应国家需要。一个家庭妇女，能在短短的时间内，考上五级汽车司机，并且当上汽车队队长。一个普通工人，听说新疆克拉玛依发现了大油田，通夜睡不着，准备前往支援。……这是何等的英雄气概！
    豪迈的事业啊豪迈的人！
