Xinhua News Agency, London, July 19th: British cabinet ministers and military leaders are currently studying how to cut British military spending. Although no official has revealed a definitive figure for the cuts, it is widely rumored in London that the figure will reach 500 million pounds – one-third of the current annual military expenditure.

There are also reports that the UK military spending cuts may involve its plan to reduce its troops stationed in West Germany from four divisions to two. West Germany's reduction of its maintenance costs for foreign troops has facilitated the UK's plan to reduce its troops stationed in West Germany.

Reuters said that the reason for this reduction is primarily the UK's "serious economic situation." Military expenditure, which currently accounts for one-third of the government's total expenditure, is the heaviest burden on the British economy. British officials admit that the proportion of military expenditure in the UK's national income is almost twice that of other European countries. Among military expenditures, one of the largest items is the cost of maintaining a standing army. Therefore, the Labor Party advocates reducing the two-year term of military service to one and a half years, and British Prime Minister Eden also advocated in a recent speech to cut military spending to help Britain overcome economic difficulties and cope with increasing competition in foreign trade.

In addition, the easing of international tensions and the so-called "balance" created by the possession of nuclear weapons by both the Soviet Union and Western countries also have an impact on the UK's consideration of reducing military spending.

According to Reuters, the UK will discuss the issue of reducing military spending with its NATO allies and intends to submit the results of the discussion to the council meeting of this military bloc to be held in Paris in December.

    经济情况严重　国际局势缓和
    英国政府首脑研究削减军费
    据新华社19日讯　伦敦消息：英国内阁大臣和军事首脑目前正在研究如何削减英国军费开支问题。虽然还没有官方透露肯定的削减的数字，但是伦敦流传很广的消息说，这个数字将达到五亿英镑——占目前每年军费开支的三分之一。
    还有消息说，英国的军费削减可能牵涉到它把驻西德军队从四个师减少到两个师的计划。西德削减它对外国驻军的维持费用这件事促进了英国裁减驻西德军队的计划。
    路透社说，造成这种削减的原因，首先是英国“严重的经济情况”。目前占政府全部开支的三分之一的军事开支，对英国经济来说是最沉重的负担。英国官方承认，在英国的军费负担在国民收入中的比重几乎两倍于欧洲其他国家。在军费开支中，最大的项目之一是维持常备军的费用。因此工党主张把两年的兵役期限减为一年半，而英国首相艾登在最近的演说中也主张削减军费开支来帮助英国渡过经济困难和应付日益加剧的对外贸易的竞争。
    此外，国际紧张局势的缓和以及苏联和西方国家都拥有核子武器而造成的所谓“平衡”，对英国考虑削减军费开支也有影响。
    据路透社消息说，英国将同它的北大西洋公约盟国讨论关于削减军费开支的问题，并且打算把讨论结果提交这个军事集团的理事会十二月在巴黎举行的例会。
