This newspaper's Urumqi dispatch: The 8704N early-maturing, automatic-defoliating long-staple cotton, which the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps is trial-planting this year at the Wusu Farm Agricultural Experiment Station, has now begun to bud. According to observations, there is great hope for cultivating this new variety of long-staple cotton in northern Xinjiang. This long-staple cotton is a new variety introduced from the Soviet Union this year. The cotton plants are strong, not easily lodged, and short in appearance. Its advantages are early boll opening, good fiber quality, and high yield. Its greatest feature is that it can defoliate automatically when the cotton bolls are mature without any chemicals or manual assistance, making it easy for machine harvesting.

    新疆试种的“8704N”自动脱叶棉现蕾
    本报乌鲁木齐电　新疆生产建设兵团今年在乌苏农场农业试验站试种的8704N早熟自动脱叶长绒棉，目前已经开始现蕾。根据观察，新品种长绒棉在北疆栽培有很大希望。这种长绒棉是今年由苏联引进的新品种，棉株强健，不易倒伏，外形短小。它的优点是吐絮早、纤维好、产量高。它的最大特点是，不用任何药剂和人工帮助，就能在棉铃成熟的时候自行脱叶，便于机器收割。　　　　　　　　　（生产战线报社）
