This newspaper reports from Guangzhou on July 19th: The primary technical problem of realizing agricultural mechanization in the paddy field areas of Southern China has been initially resolved. The "DT-54" crawler tractor and "Retuo-25K" small rubber-wheeled tractor, modified by the Agricultural Machine Tractor Station in Zhongshan, Guangdong Province, are now pulling five-furrow plows, disc harrows, and three-furrow plows on sandy fields with a water depth of six to nine centimeters and heavy clay soil, conducting large-scale cultivation.

In the past, it was generally believed that tractors could only be used on dry land and not for cultivation in paddy fields. Last year, the Zhongshan Agricultural Machine Tractor Station repeatedly tried to use modified "DT-54" crawler tractors for paddy field cultivation, but without success. At the beginning of this year, technicians and tractor drivers from the tractor station formed an experimental group. Based on the suggestions of Soviet tractor expert V.M. Trushnikov and agricultural machinery expert P.A. Andreyev, they replaced the paper pads of the driving wheels of the "DT-54" crawler tractor with rubber pads and added a rubber ring to the gap between the reduction gear hub and the oil seal protection hub. In addition, glue was seeped into the large felt pads of the driving wheels. After this modification, the tractor could maintain seven days of cultivation in paddy fields, but after seven days, it could not be guaranteed that mud and water would not penetrate the driving wheels. Later, the experimental group continued to design a large rubber skeleton-type oil seal ring and installed it inside the driving wheel. The test results proved that this oil seal ring could indeed prevent mud and water from entering. The problem of the "DT-54" crawler tractor working in paddy fields was thus solved.

During the test of using the "Retuo-25K" small tractor for paddy field cultivation, many difficulties were also encountered. The four wheels of this tractor are all rubber tires, and it is prone to sinking, slipping, and increasing resistance when walking on soft sandy fields. The experimental group initially used blade-type iron wheels designed by Shao Yaojian, a lecturer at South China Agricultural College, to replace the rear rubber wheels. After three tests, each time improving based on the actual situation, there were still shortcomings such as the front wheels bouncing and mud accumulation, making it impossible to cultivate smoothly. Finally, Ge Fulu, a technician from the Guangdong Provincial Department of Agriculture, designed another type of iron wheel with twelve blades and welded the two wheel rims on both sides of the iron wheel to the middle of the wheel hub, which overcame the phenomenon of mud accumulation when the iron wheel was walking. During cultivation, the rear wheels bear the same weight as the front wheels, the body is stable, and the effect is good.

These two types of modified tractors cultivate to a depth of 20 centimeters, which is about twice as deep as plowing with old-style plows pulled by oxen. The "DT-54" crawler tractor can cultivate 100 to 120 mu of land in eight hours a day, and the "Retuo-25K" small tractor can cultivate 30 mu of land per day.

On July 3rd, the Zhongshan Agricultural Machine Tractor Station has dispatched the modified tractors to carry out summer cultivation for local agricultural cooperatives, and it is expected that 15,000 mu of land can be cultivated within a month. (Southern Daily) (with picture)

    广东中山农业机器拖拉机站经过多次试验
    水田用的拖拉机改装成功
    本报广州19日电　我国南方水田地区实现农业机械化的首要技术问题已初步解决了。广东省中山农业机器拖拉机站改装成功的“德特—54”链轨式拖拉机和“热托—25K”小型胶轮式拖拉机，正在水深六公分到九公分、土质粘重的沙田上，牵引着五铧犁、圆盘重耙和三铧犁，进行大规模的耕作。
    过去，一般人认为拖拉机只能在旱地上使用，不能在水田耕作。去年，中山农业机器拖拉机站曾经多次试用改装过的“德特—54型”链轨式拖拉机下水田耕作，都没有成功。今年初，拖拉机站的技术人员和拖拉机手等组成了一个试验小组。他们根据苏联拖拉机专家华·马·特鲁施尼柯夫和农业机器专家彼·阿·安德列耶夫的建议，把“德特—54”链轨式拖拉机驱动轮的纸垫改为胶皮垫，在减速齿轮毂和阻油圈保护毂中间的间隙加入了一个胶皮圈，另外用胶水渗到驱动轮的大毡垫中去。这样改装以后，拖拉机在水田里可以维持七天的耕作，但是七天之后还不能保证泥浆水不浸入驱动轮。后来，试验小组继续设计了一个大型的胶制的骨架式阻油圈，安装在驱动轮内。试验结果，证明这种阻油圈的确能够防止泥浆水浸入。“德特—54”链轨式拖拉机下水田耕作的问题于是解决了。
    在进行“热托—25K”小型拖拉机下水田耕作试验过程中，也遇到了许多困难。这种拖拉机的四个轮子都是胶胎轮，在土质松软的沙田上行走，有容易下陷、打滑和加大阻力等困难。试验小组最初采用华南农学院讲师邵耀坚设计的叶片式铁轮来代替后胶轮，经过三次试验，每次并根据实际情况加以改进，但是还有前轮跳起、积泥等缺点，不能顺利耕作。最后，广东省农业厅技术员葛福禄设计了另一种十二块叶片的铁轮，并将铁轮两边的两个轮圈合并焊在轮毂中间，才克服了铁轮行走时积泥的现象，耕作时后轮负重和前轮相等，机身平稳，效果良好。
    这两种经过改装的拖拉机牵引农具耕作，耕深达到二十公分，比用牛拉旧式犁耕作深一倍左右。“德特—54”链轨式拖拉机每天八小时可以耕地一百到一百二十亩，“热托—25K”小型拖拉机每天可以耕地三十亩。
    七月三日，中山农业机器拖拉机站已派出改装的拖拉机为当地的农业合作社进行夏耕，预计一个月内可以耕地一万五千亩。　（南方日报）（附图片）
