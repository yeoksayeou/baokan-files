    Please Look in the Mirror of the "Four Books for Women"
    Shu Wu

    Thirty years ago, someone wrote to Mr. Lu Xun, "thinking that women in the North are too rigid while women in the South are too lively, and couldn't help but 'feel emotional about it'." Mr. Lu Xun gave this sentiment "a fierce lesson, roughly saying that since he did not approve of 'rigidity' or 'liveliness,' it was equivalent to advocating that women should be neither dead nor alive, which was completely wrong." ("Complete Works of Lu Xun," Volume 4, page 41)

    Today, in the discussion about Li Yu's lyrics, someone again declared that the lines "chewing red velvet and spitting with a smile towards her darling" are not good, the reason being that such an image of a woman is frivolous, and so on.

    One cannot help but be reminded of the famous work of "Eternal Female Teacher" Cao Dajia (Ban Zhao), the "Admonitions for Women," listed as the first of the "Four Books for Women." Its "Reverence and Submissiveness" chapter says: "The goodness of husband and wife is that they never leave each other throughout their lives. When circling in the boudoir, they will gradually become intimate and familiar. Once intimacy and familiarity arise, their words will be excessive. Once their words are excessive, indulgence will inevitably follow. Once indulgence arises, the thought of insulting the husband will be born." This is very clear. According to this argument, "chewing" and "spitting with a smile" are the ultimate in intimacy, familiarity, and indulgence, so it is no wonder they are denounced as "frivolous."

    We live in today, but indeed there are still many people whose minds have not been thoroughly liberated from all kinds of outdated and ugly ideas. Recently, "Chinese Women," "Chinese Youth," "New Observer," and other newspapers and periodicals have exposed a large number of bad phenomena and erroneous ideas regarding the treatment of women, indicating that there are still many believers in the "Four Books for Women" today.

    There are many examples, but let's just talk about the issue of female images.

    It is said that some young women who are more lively, love to talk and laugh, and love to play, are often pointed at and gossiped about by the people around them, saying that they are "not serious in their work style," "not solemn in their attitude," and "have a bad influence on the masses," and so on. Although this kind of discussion is decorated with many new terms, it is easy to find its original face by looking into the "Four Books for Women."

    The "Female Analects" written by Song Ruozhao of the Tang Dynasty, listed as the third of the "Four Books for Women," says in its "Conduct Chapter": "Do not look back when walking, do not lift your lips when speaking. Do not move your knees when sitting, do not shake your skirt when standing. Do not laugh loudly when happy, do not raise your voice when angry." The "Inner Training" written by Empress Renxiao of the Ming Dynasty, listed as the second of the "Four Books for Women," says in its "Caution in Speech Chapter": "Every word and every silence should be moderate and balanced, conforming to the nature of Kun's tranquility."

    No need to copy more, just these few are enough for some new moralists today to use as a mirror to see what they are really thinking.

    In this mirror, not only will a typical image of a woman who is neither dead nor alive appear, deeply satisfying all old and new moralists; but also a typical environment will appear: that is, a black lacquered door in a deep alley, door couplets such as "Loyalty and Filial Piety are passed down for generations, Poetry and Books are inherited for ages," inside the door is a stillness like stagnant water, and occasionally one or two ghost-like shadows slowly pass by. . . .

    I think this should be able to awaken the new moralists. I believe that their ardent support for socialism is no different from others, so why do they become new moralists on the issue of women? This is something to think deeply about.

    请照“女四书”的镜子
    舒芜
    三十年前，有人写信给鲁迅先生，“以为北方女子太死板而南方女子太活泼，不禁‘感慨系之矣’了。”鲁迅先生对于这个感慨“加以猛烈的教诫，大致是说他‘死板’和‘活泼’既然都不赞成，即等于主张女性应该不死不活，那是万分不对的。”（“鲁迅全集”第四卷四一页）
    今天，在关于李煜词的讨论中，又有人宣称“烂嚼红茸，笑向檀郎唾”两句是不好的，理由是，这样的女性的形象是轻浮的，云云。
    不能不令人想起“千古女师”曹大家（班昭）的名著，列在“女四书”第一部的“女诫”。其“敬顺”章有云：“夫妇之好，终身不离。房室周旋，遂生媟黩。媟黩既生，语言过矣。语言既过，纵恣必作。纵恣既作，则侮夫之心生矣。”这是十分明白的。持此论之，则“烂嚼”“笑唾”，真媟黩纵恣之尤，其被斥为“轻浮”，诚无足怪了。
    我们生活在今天，但确实还有许多人的头脑却还没有从种种陈腐丑恶的观念之下彻底地解放出来。近来，“中国妇女”，“中国青年”，“新观察”以及其他报刊，都大量揭露了许多对待妇女的恶劣现象和错误思想，说明今天还有不少人是“女四书”的信徒。
    例子很多，还是只谈谈有关女性形象方面的问题。
    据说，很有些性情活泼一些，爱说爱笑，爱玩爱闹的女青年，往往被周围的人们指点议论，说是“作风不严肃”，“态度不庄重”，“群众影响不好”，云云。这种议论尽管用了许多的新名词装点起来，但只要到“女四书”里面去找一找，便很容易找到它的本来面目。
    唐代宋若昭所作的“女论语”，列在“女四书”的第三部，其“立身章”有云：“行莫回头，语莫掀唇。坐莫动膝，立莫摇裙。喜莫大笑，怒莫高声。”明代仁孝文皇后所作的“内训”，列在“女四书”的第二部，其“慎言章”有云：“一语一默，从容中道，以合于坤静之体。”
    不必多抄了，就这几条，便很够给今天某些新道学家用作镜子，照一照自己所想的究竟是些什么。
    在这个镜子里面，不仅会出现一个不死不活的女性形象的典型，为一切新旧道学家们所深深满意；而且还会出现一个典型环境：那就是深巷内一个黑漆大门，“忠孝传家久，诗书继世长”之类的门联，门内是死水一样的静寂，偶然有一两个幽灵似的影子慢慢游过。……
    我想，这应该是能够促使新道学家们猛醒的。我相信，他们对社会主义的热烈拥护，与别人并无二致，为什么在妇女问题上却变成新道学家呢？这便大可以深长思之了。
