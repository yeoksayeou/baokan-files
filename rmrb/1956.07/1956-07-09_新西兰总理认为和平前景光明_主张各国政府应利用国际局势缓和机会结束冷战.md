    Xinhua News Agency, 8th dispatch from London: New Zealand Prime Minister Holland said in London on July 7, when talking about the results of this Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference: "There are signs that the Cold War may be coming to an end. Opportunities are presenting themselves, and if these opportunities can be properly seized, it can lead to a better era in world affairs." He believes that governments of all countries must make the right decisions to make the most of these opportunities.
    He said that after the Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference conducted an in-depth study of world affairs and the intentions of the Soviet Union, it unanimously agreed that the prospect of peace now seems brighter than it has been for many years. He said, "We certainly do not intend to relax our vigilance," but "this conclusion will obviously affect our attitude towards defense planning work and defense spending." He also said, "Whatever we do in terms of defense, it will affect the entire economic life of our respective countries."

    主张各国政府应利用国际局势缓和机会结束冷战
    新华社8日讯　伦敦消息：新西兰总理赫兰七月七日在伦敦谈到这次英联邦总理会议的讨论结果时说：“有迹象表明，冷战状态可能即将结束。各种机会正在展现出来，如果能够适当抓住这些机会，那就能够在世界事务方面导向较好的时代。”他认为，各国政府必须作出正确的决定，以尽量利用这些机会。
    他说，英联邦总理会议对世界事务和苏联的意图进行深入的研究以后一致认为，和平的前景现在似乎比过去许多年都更加光明。他说，“我们当然无意放松警惕”，但是“这个结论显然将影响我们对待防御计划工作和防御开支的态度”。他并且说，“不论我们在防御方面做些什么，这都将对我们各国的整个经济生活发生影响。”
