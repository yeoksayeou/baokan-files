    Starting from Inciting Peasants to Fight
    Shi Chao
    It is a strange thing for a deputy minister of a county Party committee to incite peasants to fight, but it is a true thing. This deputy minister is none other than He Hongyuan, deputy minister of the Mutual Aid and Cooperation Department of the Qingitian County Party Committee in Zhejiang.
    In order to complete the plan of expanding the planting of double-cropping rice, the Zhangdan Agricultural Production Cooperative in Zhangdan Township, Qingitian County, without obtaining the consent of the peasants outside the cooperative, made a unilateral decision: to exchange the cooperative's bad fields for the good fields of more than thirty peasant households; later, they arbitrarily prevented peasants outside the cooperative from planting rice seedlings in these fields, thus causing disputes and fights with more than thirty peasant households outside the cooperative.
    After this happened, Deputy Minister He rushed over. He did not make any criticism of the cooperative's behavior of harming the interests of peasants outside the cooperative. Instead, at a meeting of cooperative members, he incited the members to fight with the peasants outside the cooperative. He said: "If the individual households hit us, we must also hit them!" "If he has a knife, I have a gun, and we must resolutely defeat 'capitalism'. We will help the agricultural cooperative even if we die."
    Everyone knows that cadres engaged in mutual aid and cooperation work are the people who specifically implement the policy of agricultural collectivization. Therefore, he should educate the members to unite and help the peasants outside the cooperative, and gradually lead everyone onto the road of collectivization. This Deputy Minister He did the opposite. He condoned the cooperative's taking advantage of the peasants outside the cooperative, and incited the cooperative cadres to use force to attack the peasants outside the cooperative. In reality, is this "helping the cooperative" or destroying the cooperative?
    Everyone knows that all our staff members are servants of the people. In terms of the peasants, we are the servants of the peasants who have joined the cooperative, and we are still the servants of the peasants who have not joined the cooperative. This Deputy Minister He obviously did not understand this point. He regarded the cooperative cadres as his "thugs" and the peasants outside the cooperative as his "enemies," and let the former "resolutely defeat" the latter. In reality, is this promoting the unity of the peasants or creating divisions among the peasants?
    Now, we are in the process of full collectivization. For all peasants who have not yet joined the cooperative, we only have the obligation to help and unite them, and we have absolutely no right to discriminate against and attack them. Only in this way can we continuously consolidate and expand the ranks of the cooperative and truly realize collectivization. This fighting incident is an extremely isolated incident, but all those who have the idea of discriminating against peasants outside the cooperative should learn a lesson from this incident.

    从鼓动农民打架说起
    石迢
    县委的副部长鼓动农民打架，这是奇怪的事，然而却是真实的事。这位副部长不是别人，就是浙江青田县委互助合作部副部长贺洪元。
    青田县章旦乡章旦农业生产合作社为了完成扩种连作稻的计划，不征得社外农民的同意，就单独决定：用社里的坏田调换三十多户农民的好田；以后，又随意阻止社外农民在这些田里插秧，因此，和三十多个社外农民发生了争吵、斗殴的事件。
    这事发生后，贺副部长赶来了，他对合作社这种损害社外农民利益的行为不做任何批评，却在社员大会上鼓动社员和社外农民打架。他说：“单干户打了我们，我们也要打他！”“他有刀，我有枪，坚决打败‘资本主义’，我们是死也要帮助农业社的。”
    谁都知道，担任互助合作工作的干部，是具体执行农业合作化政策的人。因此，他应当教育社员，团结和帮助社外农民，逐步的使大家都走上合作化的道路。这位贺副部长却完全相反，他纵容合作社占社外农民的便宜，鼓动社干部用武力打击社外农民。在实际上，这究竟是“帮助合作社”呢？还是破坏合作社呢？
    谁都知道，我们的一切工作人员都是人民的勤务员。在农民方面说来，我们是入了社的农民的勤务员，同样也仍然是没有入社的农民的勤务员。这位贺副部长显然没有理解到这一点，他把社干部作为他的“打手”，把社外农民作为他的“敌人”，并让前者“坚决打败”后者。在实际上，这究竟是促进农民团结呢？还是制造农民分歧呢？
    现在，我们正处在全面合作化的进程中，对一切暂时尚未入社的农民，我们只有帮助和团结他们的义务，决没有歧视和打击他们的权利。只有这样，才会不断地巩固和扩大合作社的队伍，才会真正地实现合作化。这个打架的事件是极其个别的事件，但一切具有歧视社外农民思想的人，都应从这个事件中吸取一点教训。
