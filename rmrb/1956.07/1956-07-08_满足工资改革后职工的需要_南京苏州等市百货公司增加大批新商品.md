To Meet the Needs of Employees After Wage Reform
Department Stores in Cities Such as Nanjing and Suzhou Increase Large Numbers of New Products

(Our Dispatch) State-owned department stores in Nanjing, Suzhou, Changzhou, Xuzhou, Nantong and other cities in Jiangsu Province have recently sent special personnel to various places to organize sources of goods and increase new varieties to meet the needs of employees' increased purchasing power after the wage reform.

The variety of goods handled by Nanjing Department Store has increased from more than 8,000 in April to more than 10,000. In order to fully meet the needs of coal miners and salt workers for daily necessities, Xuzhou Department Store has transported a large number of general merchandise from Beijing, Tianjin, Hangzhou, Shanghai and other places. Nantong Department Store has added more than 1,300 new commodities since the second quarter and is continuing to expand its purchases. In addition to adding more than 100 kinds of commodities such as mosquito nets, leather shoes, cups, glass vases, and travel thermos bottles, Suzhou Department Store has also added dozens of kinds of food that were not previously supplied, such as Fenghua canned bamboo shoots, milk powder, and coffee.

While preparing goods to welcome wage reform, employees of state-owned department stores in these areas also studied various sales methods to facilitate customer purchases. Wuxi Department Store adopted the promotion method of "cross-attendance, door-to-door with samples," which facilitated customer selection. Changzhou Department Store focused on promoting the "ticket-drawing and delivery" method, which can shorten the customer's purchasing time by more than half.

    满足工资改革后职工的需要
    南京苏州等市百货公司增加大批新商品
    本报讯　江苏省南京、苏州、常州、徐州、南通等市国营百货公司，最近纷纷派出专人到各地组织货源，增加新品种，以满足工资改革以后职工购买力增长的需要。
    南京市百货公司经营的品种已经从四月份的八千多种增加到一万多种。徐州市百货公司为充分满足煤矿工人和盐民们对生活用品的需要，已经从北京、天津、杭州、上海等地运来了大量日用百货。南通市百货公司第二季度以来已经增加了1，300多种新商品，最近还在继续扩大进货。苏州市百货公司除新增添了蚊帐、皮鞋、口杯、玻璃花瓶、旅行热水瓶等一百多种商品以外，还增加了奉化罐头笋和奶粉、咖啡等几十种过去没有供应过的食品。
    这些地区的国营百货公司职工，在准备货物迎接工资改革的同时，还研究了各种便利顾客购买的售货方法。无锡市百货公司采用了“交叉出勤、带样上门”的推销方法，便利了顾客选购。常州市百货公司重点推行了“抽票发货”的办法，顾客买货的时间可以缩短一半以上。
