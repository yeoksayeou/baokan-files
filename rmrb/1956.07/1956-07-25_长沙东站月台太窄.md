    Changsha East Station Platform Too Narrow

    The third platform of Changsha East Station sees a lot of cargo traffic every day. However, this platform is very narrow, and there are very few scales. It is very crowded when working, and the phenomenon of wasted work is very serious. Almost every day, each person wastes about one and a half hours due to queuing for weighing, and overturning accidents occur constantly. In order to ensure the safety of workers and state property, we have repeatedly suggested leveling the deep pit on the east side of the platform to expand the workers' operating area and adding more gates and scales. These are not very troublesome things and would not cost much money. However, the Changsha East Station Railway Business Office has consistently failed to resolve this issue.

    长沙东站月台太窄
    长沙东站三月台，每天都有许多货物进出。可是这个月台很窄，磅秤也很少。工作的时候十分拥挤，窝工现象非常严重。差不多每天每人因过秤排队而浪费的时间总有一个半钟头左右，翻车事故也不断发生。为了保证工人的安全和国家的财产，我们曾几次建议把月台东边的深坑垫平，扩大工人操作面积，多开几道门增加几个磅秤。这些并不是什么很费事的事情，也花不了多少钱。可是长沙东站铁路营业所一直不给解决。
