    May Sino-Vietnamese Friendship Be Further Consolidated
    Today is the first anniversary of the publication of the Joint Communiqué of the Chinese and Vietnamese governments. This is a day worth commemorating. In June and July of last year, the Government Delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, led by President Ho Chi Minh, visited our country, held talks with the Government Delegation of our country, and published the Joint Communiqué of the Chinese and Vietnamese governments on July 7. This communiqué is an important milestone in the further development of friendly relations between China and Vietnam. During the talks, the governments of China and Vietnam reached unanimous agreement on various issues of common concern and major international issues, reaffirmed that the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence should serve as the guiding principles of relations between countries, and expressed their intention to work towards the thorough implementation of the Geneva Accords and to strengthen economic and cultural ties between the two countries. This is of great significance both for the respective just struggles of the two countries and for the cause of peace in the Far East and the world.
    Over the past year, thanks to the joint efforts of the two governments and peoples, the friendly relations between China and Vietnam have developed satisfactorily. The opening of the joint China-Vietnam railway transport in August last year and the official opening of the China-Vietnam air route in April this year are major events in the lives of the people of both countries. This provides rapid and convenient transportation conditions for the two countries and will further strengthen friendly cooperation and economic and cultural ties between the two countries. In the past year, delegations from China in trade, agriculture, women, literature and art, and other fields have visited the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and delegations from the Democratic Republic of Vietnam in ethnic minorities, education, broadcasting, health, literature and art, and other fields have also visited our country. The continuous strengthening of exchanges between the people of China and Vietnam has enabled the people of the two countries to understand each other better and has made the cooperation between the two peoples closer. All of these have further strengthened the brotherly friendship and unity between the people of China and Vietnam.
    Our people are very concerned about the fraternal Vietnamese people's struggle to restore and build North Vietnam and strive for the reunification of their country. The Vietnamese people achieved remarkable achievements in 1955, the first year of the two-year economic recovery plan. In the past year, land reform has been completed in about one-third of the area of ​​North Vietnam; most of the more than 130,000 hectares of land that had been barren during the war have been replanted with crops; river embankments with a total length of 3,000 kilometers have been repaired; the rice planting area has increased by 15% compared with 1954; many factories have resumed production; and foreign trade has increased fourfold compared with 1954. At present, the Vietnamese people are working hard to realize the 1956 national plan. The great achievements made by the Vietnamese people in their restoration and construction have inspired our people's struggle to build socialism.
    In the past year, thanks to the continuous efforts of peace-loving countries and people, international tensions have eased, the area of ​​peace has further expanded, more and more countries in the world are willing to and demand peaceful coexistence, and the United States' policy of strength has been increasingly rejected by people. However, the United States is still adhering to its bankrupt "Cold War" policy, continuing to create tension in the Asian region, and doing everything possible to obstruct the implementation of the Geneva Accords. According to the provisions of the Geneva Accords, the responsible authorities of both regions of Vietnam should have begun consultations on the issue of general elections from July 20 last year, in order to conduct general elections under the supervision of the International Commission this July to realize the national unification of Vietnam. Although the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the Vietnamese people have made unremitting efforts for this purpose, the Vietnamese people's desire to achieve national reunification through free general elections has not yet been realized due to the obstruction and sabotage of the United States. On May 8 this year, the two chairmen of the Geneva Conference—the Soviet Union and the United Kingdom—put forward important proposals: requesting both sides in Vietnam to make every effort to implement the Geneva Accords, requesting the International Commission to continue to contribute to maintaining and consolidating peace in Vietnam, and pointing out that, if necessary, it would discuss necessary measures to guarantee the fulfillment of the Geneva Accords, including convening a new conference attended by the participating countries of the Geneva Conference and the member countries of the International Commission. This proposal is in line with the demands of the Vietnamese people and the people of all countries who are concerned about the peace and unification of Vietnam. The Chinese people fully support this proposal and will continue to work with the Vietnamese people and peace-loving people of all countries to promote the thorough implementation of the Geneva Accords.
    On the occasion of the first anniversary of the publication of the Joint Communiqué of the Chinese and Vietnamese governments, we congratulate the further consolidation of the brotherly friendship and unity between the people of China and Vietnam, and congratulate the Vietnamese people on achieving greater success in their struggle for the peace and unification of their motherland.

### 祝中越友谊更加巩固

    祝中越友谊更加巩固
    今天是中越两国政府联合公报发表的一周年。这是一个值得纪念的日子。去年六、七月间，由胡志明主席率领的越南民主共和国政府代表团访问了我国，同我国政府代表团举行了会谈，并于七月七日发表了中越两国政府联合公报。这个公报是中越两国友好关系进一步发展的重要里程碑。中越两国政府在会谈中对双方共同关心的各项问题和重大国际问题取得了一致的意见，重申了和平共处五项原则应该作为各国关系的指导原则，并且表示将努力促进日内瓦协议的彻底实施，加强两国经济和文化的联系。这无论对于两国各自的正义斗争，或是对于远东和世界的和平事业都有着十分重大的意义。
    一年以来，由于两国政府和人民的共同努力，中越两国的友好关系有了令人满意的发展。去年八月中越两国铁路联运的通车，今年四月中越航线的正式开航，都是中越两国人民生活中的大事情。这为两国提供了迅速便利的交通条件，将进一步加强两国的友好合作和经济文化的联系。在过去一年中，我国贸易、农业、妇女、文艺等方面的代表团访问了越南民主共和国，越南民主共和国的少数民族、教育、广播、卫生、文艺等方面的代表团也访问了我国。中越两国人民来往的不断加强，使两国人民彼此更加了解，使两国人民之间的合作更加亲密。所有这些，都进一步加强了中越两国人民的兄弟般的友谊和团结。
    我国人民十分关切兄弟般的越南人民恢复建设越南北方和争取祖国统一的斗争。越南人民在执行经济恢复两年计划的第一年——1955年中获得了显著的成就。在去年一年中，约有占越南北方人口三分之一的地区完成了土地改革；战时荒芜了的十三万多公顷土地大半重新种上了庄稼；总长三千公里的河堤得到修复；稻子种植面积比1954年增加了15％；许多工厂恢复了生产；对外贸易比1954年增加了四倍。目前，越南人民正为实现1956年国家计划而努力。越南人民在恢复建设中所取得的巨大成就，鼓舞了我国人民建设社会主义的斗争。
    在过去一年中，由于爱好和平的国家和人民的不断努力，国际紧张局势已经趋向缓和，和平地区进一步扩大了，世界上越来越多的国家愿望和要求和平共处，美国的实力政策遭到了越来越多的人们的唾弃。但是美国还在坚持已经破产了的“冷战”政策，还在亚洲地区继续制造紧张局势，并且千方百计地阻挠日内瓦协议的实施。根据日内瓦协议的规定，越南双方地区负责当局应从去年七月二十日开始就普选问题进行协商，以便今年七月在国际委员会的监督下进行普选，实现越南的全国统一。虽然，越南民主共和国政府和越南人民为此进行了不懈的努力，但是，由于美国的阻挠和破坏，越南人民通过自由普选以实现国家统一的愿望至今仍然未能实现。今年五月八日，日内瓦会议的两位主席——苏联和英国提出了重要的建议：要求越南双方尽一切努力来实现日内瓦协议，要求国际委员会继续为维护和巩固越南的和平作出贡献，并指出在必要的情况下，将讨论保证履行日内瓦协议的必要措施，包括召开由日内瓦会议参加国和国际委员会成员国参加的新的会议。这个建议是符合于越南人民和关心越南的和平和统一的各国人民的要求的。中国人民完全支持这个建议，并将同越南人民和各国爱好和平的人民一起，继续努力以促进日内瓦协议的彻底实施。
    在中越两国政府联合公报发表一周年的时候，我们祝贺中越两国人民兄弟般的友谊和团结更加巩固，祝贺越南人民争取祖国和平和统一的斗争获得更大的成就。
