    Merging of Cooperatives (1)
    Adapted by: Tu Honghen; Drawn by: Jiang Ying
    (Adapted from Xu Guangyao's original work "Shuming and Yinghua")
    1　This is Luo Shuming, an outstanding young man from Willow Tree Village. Before liberation, he herded pigs for the landlord. After the land reform, he entered junior primary school at the age of fifteen. By the time he graduated in 1952, he was already eighteen years old.
    2　At that time, Shuming had an uncle in Harbin who said he would find him a job. This news alarmed Li Baichuan, a well-known shrewd man in the village, who quickly promised his daughter Yinghua to him.
    3　Unexpectedly, in the spring of the following year, Shuming did not go to Harbin but single-mindedly started a mutual aid team. Li Baichuan said he was "good for nothing," and before summer, he found a random "reason" to break off the engagement with Yinghua.
    4　Shuming's father, Luo Tai, had always been intolerant of flaws. Seeing that the piece of cloth in the betrothal gifts returned by Li Baichuan was of lower quality than the one he had given initially, the two families had a big fight, and afterward, they did not associate with each other for more than a year. This is how the story begins.
