    Three Artificial Lakes Will Appear This Year
    Three artificial lakes will appear in the Manas River basin this year. The Kuitun River Reservoir, built not far north of the Dushanzi Oil Mine in Usu County, will be fully under construction in early July. This reservoir can store 50 million cubic meters of water and is expected to be completed before the freeze-up in November. After the reservoir is completed, it will provide good irrigation for the newly built 120,000 mu of cotton fields by the production corps in Suxingtan. The farmland water use of some nearby farmers will also be adjusted. About 30 kilometers east of the Kuitun River, the Anjihai Reservoir has already started construction. This reservoir mainly intercepts the floodwaters of the Jinkou River, and can store 52 million cubic meters of water. Later, with the addition of water from the Bayingou River, it will be able to irrigate more than 420,000 mu of land in the Anjihai area. In Kaindiek, west of the Kuitun River, the Liugou Reservoir, which started construction last year, is currently under intense construction. After the reservoir, which can store 64 million cubic meters of water, is completed in August this year, the waters of the Sikeshu River will no longer flood.

    今年将出现三座人造湖
    玛纳斯河流域今年将出现三座人造湖。在乌苏县境内独山子油矿以北不远的地方，修建的奎屯河水库，七月上旬将全面开工。这座水库可蓄水五千万立方公尺，预计在十一月封冻之前竣工。水库建成后，可使生产部队在苏兴滩地方新建的十二万多亩棉田获得良好灌溉。附近一部分农民的农田用水也将得到调剂。在奎屯河以东三十多公里的地方，安集海水库已经动工兴建了。这座水库主要拦蓄金沟河的洪水，计可蓄水五千二百万立方公尺，以后再加上八音沟河的水，将可灌溉安集海地区的田地四十二万多亩。在奎屯河以西的卡因地克，去年动工兴建的柳沟水库，现正在紧张施工，这座可蓄水六千四百万立方公尺的水库，今年八月竣工后，四棵树河的水将不再泛滥了。
