“Every Inch of Land is Our Own!”
Chen Bowei

Farmers love the land most. Many people say, "The land is like a mother after three years of cultivation." The struggle of farmers for land has continued for thousands of years. When operating individually, many farmers managed their small plots of land as if they were embroidering. After joining agricultural production cooperatives, their enthusiasm for labor became even higher. They actively worked to increase yields per unit area and expand the area under multiple cropping, aiming to make one mu of land produce the crops of two or three mu. They also tried their best to reclaim wasteland to continuously expand the cultivated area. The victory of agricultural cooperation has liberated manpower and also liberated the power of the land.

Regrettably, there is a dark side to the victory. In many places, after the realization of agricultural cooperation, a strange phenomenon has appeared: some useful cultivated land has been abandoned.

Some people say: The abandoned land is scattered and remote, it doesn't amount to much.

True, most of the abandoned land consists of small plots and land that is relatively far away. If only one or two plots were abandoned, it wouldn't amount to much. However, if many plots are abandoned, and they are added together, the area becomes quite large. According to incomplete statistics from Linglong District, Lin'an, Zhejiang, more than 280 mu of land has been abandoned. According to incomplete statistics from Xingyi Special District, Guizhou, in June, more than 52,000 mu of cultivated land in the entire special district had not been sown. In the area where Pan County and Pu'an County meet, there are more than 1,000 mu of abandoned land.

Why is it that good land is being abandoned after the realization of agricultural cooperation? The reasons are relatively complex. Some interplanted land between cooperatives is inconvenient to cultivate and has been abandoned. Some land has been abandoned because the owner is away and no one takes care of it. Some land belonging to farmers outside the cooperatives has not been planted due to temporary difficulties and has been abandoned. There are many other reasons for abandoning land. However, these are not the main reasons. Remote land that is inconvenient to cultivate did not suddenly appear after cooperation; people going away and farmers experiencing difficulties have also existed in the past. Abandoning land in these situations is of course noteworthy and should be remedied. However, there are other reasons that cannot but attract special attention at present.

In advanced agricultural production cooperatives, land is publicly owned, land remuneration has been abolished, people's private ownership of land has gradually faded, and they pay special attention to labor remuneration. Therefore, the members all want to cultivate good land, land that is nearby, and large, regular plots of land. They look down on land with poor soil quality, fragmented and small plots, and land that is far away. They don't feel any pain when they abandon these lands.

In the past, farmers were slaves to the land. Generation after generation, they were bound to small plots of land, shedding blood and sweat, but still unable to escape poverty and bankruptcy. Only today, when agricultural production cooperatives are organized, can farmers become the true masters of the land and utilize the land most effectively and rationally to extract more and better products than in the past. Now, the farmers' private ownership of land is gradually disappearing, which is a good phenomenon. However, it would not be good if they do not love the land because it is collectively owned.

China's existing cultivated land area is not too large, but too small. All existing cultivated land has been reclaimed by generations of farmers and this generation through much hard work. It is the most precious source of wealth for the country and the farmers themselves. To develop agricultural production, it is certainly necessary to reclaim more wasteland and increase the area of cultivated land, but under the current conditions, the main thing is to cultivate all existing cultivated land well. Not only should we cultivate intensively on fertile land that is convenient to cultivate, but also make every effort to utilize land that is not so convenient to cultivate and has poor soil quality. At the same time, by reorganizing the land and improving the soil, we should turn land that is not so convenient to cultivate into land suitable for cultivation, and turn barren land into fertile land. Since we are the masters of the land, we should treat the land with the attitude of a master, so that every piece of land listens to us and grows good crops. In places where agricultural cooperation has been realized, many agricultural cooperatives have already done so and have created many good experiences in turning bad land into good land and turning one season into two seasons. This is the style of a master and is worthy of learning by all agricultural cooperatives.

Some agricultural cooperatives, after expansion, mergers, and upgrades, have a large number of land plots and the situation is very complicated. Many management cadres of the cooperatives do not even know how much land the entire cooperative owns. How can this fully utilize the land? People in the cooperatives should conduct a detailed survey and registration of all the land owned by the cooperative, regardless of distance, size, or quality. They should implement overall planning, unified arrangements, and full utilization, planting according to the land's characteristics, so that not a single point of land is abandoned.

Some farmers are unwilling to cultivate remote land, fragmented interplanted land, and land with poor soil quality because the work quotas and remuneration standards of the cooperatives are not reasonable enough. If it takes the same amount of labor to cultivate land that is inconvenient to cultivate and of relatively poor quality, but you get less remuneration than cultivating other land, who would be willing to do so? If the work quotas and remuneration standards are set reasonably, so that the members who work on land that requires more labor and is farther away do not suffer losses, and if all the members are educated to realize that planting more land can increase production and income, why wouldn't the members be happy to do so?

From now until the autumn harvest, there is still a period of time suitable for the growth and development of crops. We should try our best to utilize the abandoned land. Is it possible to plant late autumn crops and vegetables on the land that was not sown in the spring sowing season? Can the cooperatives help farmers outside the cooperatives who are unable to cultivate their land plant it on the principle of mutual benefit? It is hoped that the comrades of agricultural production cooperatives who have this situation can seriously consider these issues.

Everyone still remembers the song: "Every inch of land is our own!" How many people shed blood to defend our land! How many people shed sweat to reclaim these lands. Today, why are so many lands being abandoned to the side? In places where advanced cooperation has been realized, the land no longer belongs to private individuals. However, every member is the master of every piece of land in the entire cooperative. As long as we use the collective strength and wisdom of all the members, and work with all our heart and soul, every inch of land can create more happiness for the members. Farmers, cherish every inch of land with the attitude of a true master!

    “每一寸土地都是我们自己的！”
    陈泊微
    农民最热爱土地。许多人说：“地种三年亲似娘。”农民为土地而进行的斗争，一直继续了千百年。许多农民在个体经营的时候，就像绣花一样地经营自己的小块土地。他们参加农业生产合作社以后，劳动积极性更高了，积极提高单位产量和扩大复种面积，要使一亩地长出两亩、三亩的农产物；并且尽力开垦荒地，使耕地面积不断地扩大。农业合作化的胜利，把人力解放了，也把地力解放了。
　　令人遗憾的是，胜利也有阴暗的一面。在不少地方，在实现了农业合作化以后，却出现了一种奇怪的现象：有些有用的耕地被荒弃了。　　
    有人说：被荒弃的土地都是零星、偏僻的，算不了什么。
　　不错，被荒弃的土地，多数是地块狭小、距离较远的土地。如果仅仅荒弃那么一块两块，确实算不了什么。但是，如果荒弃的块数很多，再把它们加起来，面积就相当大了。据浙江临安玲龙区不完全的统计，荒弃的土地就有二百八十多亩。据贵州兴义专区六月间的不完全统计，全专区有五万二千多亩耕地没有下种，光是盘县和普安县交界的地方，就有一千多亩荒弃的土地。
　　大好的土地，为什么在实现农业合作化以后却被荒弃了？原因是比较复杂的。有些社和社之间的插花地，耕种不方便，荒了。有些土地，因本主外出，无人照管，荒了。有些社外农户的土地，因为一时困难，没有种上，荒了。荒弃土地的原因，还有不少。不过，这都不是主要的。不便耕种的远地，并不是合作化以后才突然出现的；外出的人，发生困难的农户，也是过去就有的。在这些情况下抛弃了土地，当然也值得注意，也应该设法补救。但是，有另外一些原因在目前却不能不令人特别注意。
    在高级农业生产合作社里，土地公有了，土地报酬取消了，人们对于土地的私有观念逐渐淡漠了，对于劳动报酬特别重视起来。因此，社员们都想种好地、近地和整齐的大块地，看不起那些土质较差的、零碎狭小的和距离较远的土地，丢弃了这些土地也不觉得心痛。
    在过去的时代，农民是土地的奴隶，他们世世代代被束缚在小块的土地上，流尽血汗，还是摆脱不了贫穷和破产的命运。只有在今天，在组织起农业生产合作社的时候，农民才成了土地的真正的主人，才能够最有效最合理地利用土地，向土地索取比过去更多更好的产品。现在，农民的土地私有观念是逐渐消失了，这是好现象；但是如果因为土地归集体所有就不热爱它，那就不好了。
    我国现有的耕地面积，不是太多，而是太少。现有的一切耕地，都是多少年代和这一代的农民付出了许多辛勤的劳动开垦出来的，都是国家和农民自己的最宝贵的财源。发展农业生产，固然要更多地开垦荒地，增加耕地面积，但在目前的条件下，主要还是靠把现有的耕地全部种好。不但要在土质肥沃、耕作方便的土地上精耕细作，而且要把那些耕作不太方便、土质不太好的土地尽量利用起来，同时，经过整理土地和改良土壤，把耕作不太方便的变成适于耕作的，把贫瘠的变成肥沃的。既然是土地的主人，就该用主人翁的态度对待土地，让每一片土地都听我们的话，都长出好庄稼来。在实现了农业合作化的地方，不少农业合作社都已经这样做了，并且创造出了许多变坏地为好地、变一季为两季的好经验。这才是主人翁的气派，值得所有的农业合作社学习。
    有些农业合作社经过扩建、合并、升级，土地块数很多，情况十分复杂，不少合作社的管理干部连全社共有多少土地都摸不清楚，这怎么能够充分利用土地呢？合作社的人们，对于全社所有的土地，不论远近、大小、好坏，都应当经过细致的调查登记，实行全面规划，统一安排，充分利用，因地种植，做到不荒弃一分一厘地。
    有些农民所以不愿意耕种远地、零碎的插花地和土质较差的地，是因为合作社的工作定额和报酬标准规定的不尽合理。如果花同样的劳动去种那些耕作不便、质量比较差的地，比种其他的地要少得报酬，谁还肯这样干呢？如果把工作定额和报酬标准定得合情合理，使得在费劳动多的土地和远地上工作的社员不至于吃亏，又教育了全体社员认识到多种一块地就能更多地增加生产、增加收入，社员们又何乐而不为？
    从现在到秋收，还有一段适于农作物生长发育的时间。应当尽量设法利用那些荒弃的土地。是不是可以在春播季节没有播种的土地上，种上晚秋作物和蔬菜？有些社外农户无力耕种的土地，合作社是不是可以在互利的原则下帮助他们种上？希望有这种情况的农业生产合作社的同志们都能认真地考虑一下这些问题。
    大家还记得这样的歌声吧——“每一寸土地都是我们自己的！”为了保卫我们的土地，多少人流过血！为了开垦这些土地，多少人流过汗。今天，为什么却要把许多土地抛在一边？实现了高级合作化的地方，土地不再属于私人了。可是，每一个社员，都是全社每一块土地的主人。只要运用全体社员的集体的力量和智慧，尽力尽心地劳动，每一寸土地都能为社员创造出来更多的幸福。农民们，以真正的主人翁的态度，珍惜每一寸土地吧！
