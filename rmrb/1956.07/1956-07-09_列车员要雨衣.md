    Train Conductors Need Raincoats
    In 1954, the Ministry of Railways issued a set of raincoats to each train conductor, but they were taken back in 1955. I think this is unreasonable. No matter how heavy it rains, the train conductor must get off the train when it enters the station to take care of the passengers. Without a raincoat, it is very inconvenient to work. I hope the Ministry of Railways will continue to issue raincoats to train conductors. (Bengbu Train Section, Yu Xueren)

    列车员要雨衣
    1954年铁道部给每个列车员发了一套雨衣，1955年又收回去了。我认为这是不合理的。不管下多大的雨，火车一进站，列车员就得下车，照顾旅客。如果没有雨衣，工作很不方便。希望铁道部继续给列车员发雨衣。（蚌埠列车段　余学仁）
