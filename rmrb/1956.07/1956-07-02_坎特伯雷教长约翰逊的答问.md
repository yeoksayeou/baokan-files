    Canterbury Dean Johnson's Answers
    I am a student in Moscow. I believe that the greatest contribution a student can make to the cause of peace is to help build international friendship and understanding among students, making it the cornerstone of peace.
    Not long ago, I wrote a letter to Canterbury Dean Johnson, asking him to answer some questions I had about the international situation. I believe students around the world would be happy to know Dean Johnson's answers.
    (1) Can you talk about your views on the People's Republic of China, its future, and the friendship between the British people and China?
    "I have traveled all over China, and I visited again three years ago. Only twenty years have passed, but the changes are indeed amazing. Women have been liberated, diseases are being vigorously eliminated, and flies and mosquitoes have been wiped out. A new spirit of honesty has been established from top to bottom. A new work enthusiasm. Filled with confidence in the future. The land belongs to the tillers. Rapid industrialization. Overcoming the scourge of floods and famines. Universal prosperity. Children and the elderly have new hope.
    China has a bright future and has already attracted the whole world. It is shameful not to let her take her rightful place in the United Nations, but I think this will inevitably change soon.
    I hope to visit China this summer when my children are on vacation. My family, my wife, myself, and our two daughters, have been invited to participate in this year's October 1st festival celebrations. We are eagerly looking forward to that day. I will have my children write down their travel experiences and draw some sketches. They are fourteen and sixteen years old respectively. We hope to travel through Tashkent, Kazakhstan, and perhaps stay briefly in Almaty, and then go straight to China. I hope to pass through Xining; I remember it from twenty years ago. I would love to see how it has changed now.
    The purpose of our whole family is to observe the lives of ordinary people in Russia and China, and then we will write something, using a simple method - a family chronicle style.
    I am very confident that the Chinese people and the Soviet people will become closer to our British people in a united and peaceful world. All these small efforts, such as our planned visits to China and the Soviet Union, are also efforts in this direction."
    (2) What is your personal opinion on admitting the People's Republic of China into the United Nations?
    "I have already answered this in the previous question."
    (3) What is your opinion of Mr. Dulles's interview in "Life" magazine, in which he said that the purpose of American foreign policy is to continue to keep the world "on the brink of war"!
    "I think Mr. Dulles's remarks are shameful and dangerous. Fortunately, it seems the world thinks so too, and he received great condemnation for it."

### 坎特伯雷教长约翰逊的答问

    坎特伯雷教长约翰逊的答问
    我是一个莫斯科的学生。我认为一个学生对和平事业所能作的最大贡献，就是协助在学生之间建立起国际友谊和谅解，使之成为和平的基石。
    不久以前，我写了一封信给坎特伯雷教长约翰逊，请他回答我所提出的一些关于国际形势的问题。我相信全世界的学生都乐于知道约翰逊教长的回答。
    （一）你能谈一下你对中华人民共和国、她的将来和英国人民同她的友谊的意见吗？
    “我曾经游遍中国，三年前又去游历过。时光过去才二十年，可是变化确实是惊人的。妇女解放了，病害在大力扫除，苍蝇和蚊虫消灭殆尽。从上到下树立了一种新的诚实作风。新的工作热忱。充满了对未来的信心。土地属于耕者。急遽的工业化。克服洪水和饥荒的祸患。普遍的繁荣。儿童和老年人有了新的希望。
    中国有一个光明的未来，而且已经吸引了整个世界。不让她取得她在联合国内的应有地位，是可耻的，但是我想这必然很快就会改变过来的。
    我希望在今年夏天当我的孩子们度假期的时候，去访问中国。我们一家人，我的妻子、我自己和我们两个女儿，已经被请参加今年的十月一日的节日庆祝。我们正焦急地盼望着这一天的来临。我将让我的孩子们写下旅途中的见闻，并且画一些素描。她们俩人一个十四岁，一个十六岁。我们希望取道塔什干、哈萨克斯坦，或许还在阿拉木图稍作逗留，然后直往中国。我希望经过西宁，我还记得二十年前的它。我很想看看它现在变成怎么样了。
    我们全家的目的是观察俄国和中国的一般人的生活，然后由我们写一些东西，用朴素的方法——家庭记事式来写。
    我十分相信，中国人民和苏联人民跟我们英国人民将在一个团结和和平的世界上更加亲近起来。所有这一切小小的努力，如像我们所打算中的到中国和苏联的访问，也是这方面的努力。”
    （二）你个人对接纳中华人民共和国进入联合国有什么看法呢？
    “我已经在上一个问题中回答了。”
    （三）你对杜勒斯先生的“生活”杂志访问记有什么意见呢，他在那篇访问记里说，美国的外交政策的目的就是要继续使世界“濒于战争的边缘”！
    “我认为杜勒斯先生的谈话是可耻的和危险的。幸好的是，看来世界也是这样认为的，而在那次他受到了极大的谴责。”
