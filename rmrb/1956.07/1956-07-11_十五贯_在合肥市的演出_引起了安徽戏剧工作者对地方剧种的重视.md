    The Performance of "Fifteen Strings of Cash" in Hefei City
    Arouses Anhui Theater Workers' Attention to Local Operas

    (Reported by our newspaper) Recently, the Peking Opera "Fifteen Strings of Cash" was performed in Hefei City, Anhui Province, and was well received by the masses. The performance of "Fifteen Strings of Cash" has had a great impact on the Anhui theater community. People engaged in repertoire review and editing work previously did not pay enough attention to many traditional repertoires of several local opera genres such as Huangmei Opera, Lu Opera, and Sizhou Opera, believing that they were not worth revising. For example, only two of the thirty-six large-scale Huangmei Opera plays have been sorted out. Only three large-scale Lu Opera plays have been sorted out, and only one large-scale Sizhou Opera play has been sorted out. Some repertoires of the ancient Hui Opera have many commendable aspects in terms of character portrayal, story structure, and concise language, which are helpful for creating new repertoires. Peking Opera and many other opera genres have developed because of absorbing the essence of Hui Opera. However, Hui Opera in Anhui has been ignored for decades. The old Hui Opera artists are all over sixty years old and are about to disappear. Only this year has Anhui officially begun to gather Hui Opera artists to investigate and sort out repertoires. This performance of "Fifteen Strings of Cash" has further strengthened the confidence of Anhui's theater workers in the work of sorting out traditional Hui Opera repertoires. Now, more than a dozen old Hui Opera artists who have been transferred to other professions for a long time have all gathered in Wuhu. They will participate in the provincial drama festival in July, and in the future, they plan to establish a professional Hui Opera troupe. (Yu Ming)

    “十五贯”在合肥市的演出
    引起了安徽戏剧工作者对地方剧种的重视
    本报讯　安徽省合肥市在最近演出了京剧“十五贯”，受到广大群众的欢迎。“十五贯”的演出对安徽戏剧界发生了很大的影响。进行剧目编审工作的人，过去对黄梅剧、庐剧、泗洲剧等几个地方剧种的许多传统剧目，重视不够，认为都不值得再改了。如：黄梅剧三十六本大戏，现在只整理出两本。庐剧整理过的只有三本大戏，而泗洲剧，则只整理过一本大戏。古老的徽剧的有些剧目，在刻划人物、故事结构、语言精练方面，都有很多可取之处，对创作新剧目有帮助。京剧和许多剧种，都因吸收徽剧的精华而有了发展。但是徽剧在安徽却已经数十年没有人过问。徽剧老艺人都已六十多岁，几将绝传。今年以来，安徽才正式开始集中徽剧艺人，调查和整理剧目。这次“十五贯”演出，使安徽的戏剧工作者对徽剧传统剧目的整理工作，更加坚定了信心。现在，十几个转业已久的徽剧老艺人，已都集中在芜湖。他们将参加七月全省的戏剧会演，将来并准备成立专业的徽剧团。（于明）
