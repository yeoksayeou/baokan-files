    The Brilliance of the Atomic Age
    ——Introducing the Film "Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy"

    Wouldn't it be extremely exciting for people working near blast furnaces to be able to accurately determine when the furnace should be shut down for repairs? In the past, smelting chromium steel in open-hearth furnaces required waiting for over forty minutes for the ferrochrome alloy to completely and evenly melt into the molten steel. Now, we know that the ferrochrome alloy can be naturally mixed with the molten steel at the time of tapping, without waiting, allowing for quick tapping. Shortening the steelmaking time would be good news for steelworkers, wouldn't it?
    If farmers knew that crops not only absorb nutrients from their roots but also from their leaves, wouldn't they be happy to have airplanes fly over large fields, spraying fertilizer to supplement the crops' nutrition?
    An elderly man, whose mouth was covered with cancerous growths, can now calmly accept his granddaughter's affection once his cancer disappears. A little girl, who was born with vascular tumors all over her nose, finally has them completely flattened. Isn't the joy in her young mother's heart understandable?
    These are all results of the peaceful use of atomic energy.
    The release of atomic energy is the greatest discovery of the twentieth century. It is the result of long-term labor by many scientists and a great victory of human wisdom. Therefore, it should, and only should, serve human happiness and peaceful life. With the active efforts of progressive scientists around the world, we can already see a vast and magnificent vision of using atomic energy to benefit humanity. Atomic energy is increasingly permeating our lives and work.
    The Soviet Union is a pioneer in the peaceful use of atomic energy. On June 27, 1954, the world's first nuclear power plant began generating electricity in the Soviet Union. Two years later, today, in our capital Beijing, we have seen many new achievements of the Soviet Union in this field at the Soviet Exhibition of Science and Technology for Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy. At the same time, we are pleased to see the new Soviet film "Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy."
    Nuclear power plants use the heat released from uranium fission to work. The film opens the interior of the Soviet Union's first nuclear power plant for us. Inside the nuclear reactor, water shines brightly under radioactive radiation. Uranium rods, encased in aluminum tubes, are submerged in the water, where the chain reaction of uranium atomic nuclei fission takes place. Boron rods are inserted into the water to regulate the speed of the nuclear fission chain reaction, making it faster, slower, or stopping it. The enormous heat released by the nuclear fission chain reaction heats the water, and the water transfers the heat, generating steam, which can drive steam turbines to power generators. Nuclear power plants can be built in areas without fuel bases. A 100,000-kilowatt thermal power plant requires 10,000 train cars of coal per year, while a nuclear power plant only needs one train car of uranium fuel per year. It is conceivable that nuclear power plants, once established in the most remote areas, will generate tremendous power, uncover underground wealth, and awaken dormant barren mountains and deserts.
    Radioactive isotopes are byproducts of nuclear reactors. They are increasingly becoming powerful assistants to scientists, engineers, agronomists, and physicians. Placing metallic or non-metallic materials into a nuclear reactor, they can be transformed into radioactive substances under neutron bombardment. The film shows us vividly how radioactive substances are removed from the reactor. Because of their radioactivity, humans cannot approach them, so they are sawn into small pieces, sawn into the desired shapes, completely by remote control. Here, "mechanical hands" perform the functions of human hands. Utilizing the radioactivity of substances can change their properties. A plastic that cannot withstand high temperatures greatly improves its heat resistance after being irradiated with radioactive cobalt. Radioactive isotopes can be used to inspect the quality of products, and inspecting the welds of ship hulls is one such application. Adding small amounts of radioactive isotopes to ordinary substances to trace their path and determine their content allows for many research studies. This is called the "tracer atom method." Understanding the damage to the refractory layer inside blast furnaces and discovering that steelmaking time can be shortened are both results of applying tracer atoms. Studying the absorption process of crop nutrients in agriculture is also an application of tracer atoms.
      "You are cured." A woman suffering from malignant nipple cancer, after being irradiated with radioactive substances, no longer has the cancer. Smiling, she extends her hand to the doctor in gratitude. The film says that this sentence contains so much happiness. Cancer used to be a disaster that was difficult for humanity to resist, but now, humanity has finally found an effective treatment. More people will bathe in the brilliance of the atomic age, just like the woman, the elderly man, and the little girl in the film.
    We are still in the early stages of the atomic age, but we can already see the infinite benefits that atomic energy can bring to humanity. There are still a small group of people in the world who attempt to hijack the enormous power of atomic energy in their own hands to exacerbate human suffering, but they cannot reverse the wheels of history. The last few scenes of the film show us the bright prospects of the peaceful use of atomic energy: Tall power transmission towers will be erected, sending electricity to distant places; nuclear-powered icebreakers will slowly advance, breaking through the ice and sailing to the center of the Arctic Ocean. Now, nuclear-powered locomotives and nuclear-powered aircraft, as well as rockets that use atomic energy to reach other planets, are no longer distant matters.

    原子能时代的光辉
    ——介绍影片“和平利用原子能”
    王天一
    在高炉旁边操作的人们，如果能够确切地掌握应当停炉修补的时间，岂不是一件极为兴奋的事？过去在平炉内冶炼铬钢，要等铬铁合金完全均匀地熔化在钢水里，需要四十分钟以上的时间。现在知道了，就在出钢的时候，铬铁合金可以和钢水自然地搅拌在一起，用不着等待，可以很快便出钢。炼钢的时间可以缩短，对于炼钢工人来说，岂不是一个喜讯？
    如果农民们知道，作物不仅从
  根部吸收养分，还可以从叶面上吸收，因此，让飞机在大面积的田地上空驰过，把肥料喷下来，就可以给作物补充养分，农民们岂有不高兴的？
    一位老年人，嘴下生满了癌肿，一旦他的癌肿消失了，他就可以泰然地接受孙女儿对他的亲昵。一个小女孩，原先生下来鼻上就长满了血管肿，现在终于完全平伏了，她那年轻的妈妈心中的喜悦，难道不是可以理解的吗？
    这些都是和平利用原子能的结果。
    原子能的释放，是二十世纪最伟大的发现，它是许多科学家长期劳动的成果，也是人类智慧的巨大胜利。因此，它应该，也只应该为人类的幸福，为人类的和平生活服务。在全世界进步的科学家的积极努力下，我们已经可以看到一幅利用原子能为人类造福的辽阔、绚丽的远景。原子能正在一天天地渗入到我们的生活和劳动中。
    苏联是和平利用原子能的先行者。1954年6月27日，世界上第一个原子能发电站在苏联开始发电。两年后的今天，在我们的首都北京，我们从苏联和平利用原子能科学技术展览会上，看到了苏联在这方面的许多新成就。同时，我们又欣幸地看到了苏联新摄制的电影“和平利用原子能”。
    原子能发电站是利用铀分裂所释放的热量来工作的。电影为我们打开了苏联的第一个原子能发电站的内景。在原子核反应堆里面，水在放射性辐射下闪闪发光，盛在铝管内的铀棒深入到水中，在这里进行着铀原子核分裂的链式反应。在水中插着硼棒，它调节着核分裂的链式反应的速度，使它加快、减慢或者停止。核分裂的链式反应放射出来的庞大的热量使水加热，水把热传出来，产生蒸汽，就可以推动汽轮机，使发电机发电。原子能发电站可以建立在没有燃料基地的地区。一个十万瓩的火力发电站，每年需要一万车皮的煤，如果是原子能发电站，一年只要一车皮的铀燃料就够了。可以想像，在最偏僻的地区，让原子能发电站建立起来，它就将产生巨大的力量，发掘出地下的财富，唤醒沉睡的荒山与沙漠。
    放射性同位素是原子核反应堆的副产物。它正在日甚一日地成为科学家、工程师、农学家、医师的有力助手。把金属或非金属材料放到原子核反应堆里面，在中子的射击下，就可以变成有放射性的物质。电影以生动的镜头让我们看到，有放射性的物质如何从反应堆中取出来，由于它的放射性，人体不能接近，因此把它们锯切成小块、锯切成所需要的形状，完全是远距离操纵的，在这里“机械的手”执行着人手的功能。利用物质的放射性，可以改变物质的性能，一种经不起高温的塑料，经过放射性钴的照射以后，抗热性能大大地提高了。利用放射性同位素的射线，可以检查产品的质量，而检查船体的焊缝是其中的一种。把少量的放射性同位素加到普通的物质里面，来探索它的踪迹，确定它的含量，就可以进行许多研究工作。这叫做“示踪原子法”。了解高炉内耐火层损坏的情况，发现炼钢的时间可以缩短，都是应用了示踪原子的结果。在农业上研究作物养分的吸收过程，也是示踪原子的一种应用。
      “你已经痊愈了。”一个患了乳头恶性癌肿的女子，经过放射性物质照射后，癌肿已经没有了。她含着微笑，向医生伸出感谢的手。影片上说，这句话里面，包含了多少幸福。癌肿曾经是人类难以抗御的灾难，如今，人类终于找到了有效的治疗途径。更多的人，都将像电影中的女子、老年人、小女孩一样，沐浴到原子能时代的光辉。
    我们今天还处在原子时代的初期，但是我们已经可以看到原子能所能够给人类带来的无穷福祉了。世界上还有一小撮人，他们还企图把原子能的巨大威力劫持在自己手里，来加重人类的灾难，但是，他们是扭不转历史的车轮的。电影上，最后几个画面使我们看到了和平利用原子能的光辉的远景：高大的送电塔将竖立起来，把电流送向远方；原子能破冰船将会缓缓地行进，冲破冰块，驶向北冰洋的中心。现在，原子能机车和原子能飞机，以及利用原子能到别的星球上的火箭，都不是遥远的事情了。
