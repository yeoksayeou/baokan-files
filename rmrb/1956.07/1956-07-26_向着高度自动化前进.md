    Moving Towards High Automation
    Lin Xi
    Near the industrial city of Chelyabinsk in the Urals, we took the opportunity to visit the open-pit coal mine belonging to the Korkino Coal Trust. This coal mine is not as large as Donbas or other major coal mines, but its technology is also very advanced.
    It was a windy day in early June. We wore the mine's spare goggles and, braving the wind and sand, were accompanied by the trust manager, Kangolachinko, and other comrades, to visit the open-pit electric shovel coal mining, automatic belt coal transportation, mechanized hydraulic coal washing.... What particularly interested me was the electrified transportation within the mining area.
    The electrified locomotive has no boiler, no need to add coal or water, no fire to burn, and no smoke. It is as clean and hygienic as a trolley car, which is what people can imagine. Even more interesting is the automatic equipment at the station.
    As we approached the station, we saw neither complex station buildings nor bustling crowds. Trains came and went frequently, but we saw no switchmen or flag-wavers. We could almost call it an "unmanned station."
    With so many tracks and trains at the station, how can there be no one to switch the tracks and no one to direct the trains, yet the trains pass through without obstruction and without accidents? - As I was wondering, the comrade leading the way led us into a two-story small house next to the railway that we hadn't noticed at all. Up the stairs, we saw two middle-aged female attendants, one on the phone and the other standing in front of a map of the station tracks (perhaps it should be called a machine, a device, an instrument). This was not an ordinary map, but a map specially made for an exhibition. The map had red, green, and yellow small lights. The yellow small lights kept lighting up on one track or another on the map. At this time, the attendant flipped a button on the map, and a red or green light immediately appeared on the map. The manager explained to us: where the yellow light is on, it indicates that the train is there; when the yellow light goes off, it indicates that the train has left. When the attendant flips the button and a red or green light appears on the map, the station's switches close or open automatically at the same time, and red or green lights also appear on the scene at the same time. The train driver decides where to go based on these red and green lights.
    The manager continued to tell us: before this device (referring to the above-mentioned track map), each shift here required thirty-seven workers to switch the tracks, and everyone worked very hard; now, each shift only uses two people, and the work is still very easy: one person often makes phone calls to contact; the other person often flips buttons to adjust the switches. Switchmen are no longer needed at all. And the traffic volume has increased fourfold and is safer than before.
    Where have those former switchmen gone? - I wondered. During the meal, I asked the manager. At first, he counted them one by one: this person went to the substation, that person went to the mining field... Later, seeing that I kept asking about the whereabouts of the remaining workers, he seemed to suddenly understand what I meant and laughed. He smiled humorously and said: "I can't say it all at once. But you can rest assured that none of the workers who were replaced by automation equipment have lost their jobs. They have all been transferred to more important and better jobs. The female attendant who uses the button to adjust the switches is one of them. The Soviet Union has long had no unemployment problem, and it will never have unemployment problems in the future. The speed of our development requires us to have more people."
    This is one example of automation that we saw in the Soviet Union. This is certainly not the most important example. The electrification and automation of railways and stations are being stepped up in many parts of the Soviet Union. At the Dnieper Hydroelectric Power Station, six duty personnel oversee nine hydraulic turbines and other machinery with a total generating capacity of 650,000 kilowatts. At the Ordzhonikidze Cascade Power Station of the Uzbek Electricity Bureau, two or three duty personnel manage four hydropower stations from one place. At the Moscow State First Ball Bearing Factory, we saw workshops with hundreds of machines working automatically. The processed parts are automatically transferred from one process to another, all the way to the automatic inspection of the finished products, and the unqualified products are automatically selected out....
    There are many examples, but we don't need to and cannot list them all one by one. What should be explained is that the cause of automation and remote control is now developing rapidly and systematically under the organization and leadership of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet government. What looks very advanced today may not be advanced enough tomorrow. At the Magnitogorsk Iron and Steel Company in the Urals, we visited many workshops such as ironmaking, steelmaking, and steel rolling. The Soviets and people from all countries believe that the degree of automation here is very high. On a huge blast furnace that produces 2,200 to 2,300 tons of pig iron per day and night, there are only eleven people per shift. We hardly saw anyone when we went in to visit. The situation in the open hearth furnace is roughly the same. In the rolling mill, we could only see huge, red-hot steel ingots and billets running back and forth on the rollers by themselves, turning left and right, rolling back and forth, changing from short to long, from irregular to regular, and then automatically running along the rollers to the next process. Where are the people? We only found two or three in small glass rooms in the middle of one section and another. They sat on stools and operated this or that joystick like car drivers, making the huge machines and steel ingots outside the small room move according to their own intentions. The high heat radiated from the red-hot steel ingots cannot invade them. Compared with the workers using chisels to clamp red-hot steel ingots, it is not only lighter, more comfortable, but also much safer. We all rejoiced for the workers. However, in conversations with manager Volenov and other responsible persons, they were not satisfied with this level of automation. Their current goal is to replace the operators of the weighing car, the operators of the charging machine, and the operators on the control panel of the roughing mill with automatic control devices in the shortest possible time; the intermediate process of heating furnace and steel rolling should also be connected by automatic devices; the processes such as steel processing and straightening after rolling must be automated. This is also the requirement of the Sixth Five-Year Plan and the recent All-Union Conference on Automation of the Ferrous Metallurgical Industry held in Magnitogorsk for this company. The manager said: "If it's not like this, it can't be considered complete automation. It can only be considered 90% automation."
    The manager also told us that the company's design agency has now been greatly strengthened. In order to realize automation and remote control, an equipment automation group has been specially set up in the design agency. In order to facilitate remote control and observation, the first industrial television device has recently been designed and manufactured. When we were led to the television room to visit, what appeared on the television was the scene of the rolling mill: steel ingots running on the rollers, cranes passing through the air.... On the table next to it, one or two hundred buttons were installed. If the person in charge wants to check and understand the work of which workshop or section, he flips which button, and the scene of that workshop or section immediately appears on the television. However, this equipment is still being further tested and improved, with the aim of making it clearer and more ideal. In addition, a completely universal radio communication system is being established within the factory, with the aim of enabling the factory's person in charge to be able to talk to all drivers, operators, and dispatch stations at any time via radio.
    Soviet scientists and scholars are also conducting huge research work around the goal of automation and remote control. Many universities have established specialized teaching and research offices for automation and remote control; scientific research institutions are helping to establish many factories with production automation equipment. In Leningrad, we visited Professor Fadeev, a professor who specializes in the study of electrical automation and remote control problems. He told us that they are stepping up research on radio control and manipulating the entire production process. The automation equipment now required must not only be able to automatically check whether the processed parts meet the specifications, and automatically send out signals (lights on or bells ringing, etc.) if they do not meet the specifications; but also be able to automatically adjust. He excitedly told us that a device for automatically adjusting the speed of a lathe has now been successfully tested. Regarding remote control, they are now able to control the Svir and Volkhov hydroelectric power stations 200 to 400 kilometers away from Leningrad.
    All of this makes me feel that the Soviet people are creating the greatest century in history - the labor of workers and engineers will lose its boundaries. Everyone will be completely liberated from simple, tiring physical labor, and all work that does not require much mental effort will be handed over to machines. Humans only do creative work, and everyone's intelligence and talent will develop rapidly. At that time, the life of a true "human being" will be something that everyone can enjoy.

    向着高度自动化前进
    林希
    在乌拉尔的工业城市车里雅宾斯克附近，我们顺便参观了库尔金诺采煤托拉斯所属的露天煤矿。这煤矿没有顿巴斯或其他大煤矿那样的规模，但技术也很先进。
    那是六月初的一个大风的日子。我们戴了矿上备用的风镜，顶着风沙，由托拉斯经理康戈拉钦科和其他几位同志陪同，在矿野里参观了露天的电铲采煤，自动皮带运煤，机械化的水力洗煤……。特别引起我的兴趣的，是矿区内部电气化的运输。
    电气化的机车上没有锅炉，不需要添煤，添水，烧火，也没有烟尘，像电车一样清洁卫生，这是人们可以想像到的。更有趣的，是车站上的自动化装置。
    走近车站的时候，我们既看不到复杂的车站建筑，也看不到熙攘的人群。列车频繁地来往驰过，但却看不到扳道岔的和摇旗的铁路员工。我们几乎可以把它称为“无人车站”。
    车站上这样多的轨道和列车，怎么可以没有人扳道岔、没有人指挥，而列车通行无阻、不发生事故呢？——当我正在寻思的时候，领路的同志把我们领进了铁路旁边一个我们完全没有注意到的二层小屋。上了楼梯，我们看到的是两个中年的女服务员，一个正在打电话，一个站在一幅车站铁轨图（也许应该称为什么机，什么装置，什么仪器）面前。这不是一幅普通的图，而像展览会上特制的图。图上有红、绿、黄各色小园灯。黄色的小园灯，不断地在图上的这条或那条铁轨上亮起来。这时候，服务员就扳动图上的某个电钮，图上立即出现红灯或绿灯。经理向我们解释：哪里黄灯亮，就表明列车在哪里；黄灯灭了，就表明列车走了。服务员扳动电扭、图上出现红灯或绿灯的时候，车站的道岔同时自动关闭或启开，现场上也同时出现红灯或绿灯。火车司机就根据这些红绿灯决定行止。
    经理接着告诉我们：在没有这个装置（指上述铁轨图）以前，这里每班需要三十七个工人扳道岔，大家都很辛苦；现在每班只用两个人，工作还很轻快：一个人时常打打电话，联系一下；另一个人时常扳扳电钮，调整一下道岔。扳道岔工人现在根本不需要了。而行车量却增加到四倍，并且比以前安全。
    那些从前扳道岔的工人现在哪里去了呢？——我寻思着。吃饭的时候，我向经理发问。起初，他一个个地数着：这个人到了变电站，那个人到了采矿场……后来看见我一直在追问其余工人的去处，他好像忽然明白了我的意思似的，乐起来了。他诙谐地笑了笑说：“这我可一下子说不全。不过有一点你可以完全放心，就是那些被自动化装置代替了的工人一个也没有失业，他们都转到更重要的和更好的工作岗位上去了。现在那个用电钮调整道岔的女服务员，就是其中的一个。苏联老早就没有了失业问题，将来也永不会再有失业问题。我们的事业发展的速度，还要求我们有更多的人。”
    这是我们在苏联所看到的关于自动化的一个例子。这当然不是最重要的例子。铁路和车站的电气化和自动化，正在苏联许多地方加紧进行。在第聂伯水电站，六个值班人看管着总发电能力65万瓩的九个水力涡轮和其他机械。在乌兹别克电业局奥尔忠尼启则梯段电站，两三个值班人从一个地方管理着四个水电站。在莫斯科国立第一滚珠轴承厂，我们看到百十台机器自动工作的车间。加工件从一道工序，自动传送到另一道工序，一直到自动检查成品，把不合格的自动拣出……。
    例子很多，但我们不需要也不可能一一列举。应该说明的，是自动化和远距离操纵的事业，现在正在苏联共产党和苏联政府的组织和领导之下迅速地有计划地发展着。今天看去是水平很高的东西，明天看去可能就不够水平了。在乌拉尔的马格尼托哥尔斯克钢铁公司，我们参观了炼铁、炼钢、轧钢等许多车间。苏联人和各国来的人都认为这里的自动化程度是很高的。在一昼夜出生铁二千二、三百吨的巨大高炉上，每班只有十一个人。我们进去参观的时候几乎看不见人。平炉的情况也大抵如此。在轧钢车间，也只能看到巨大通红的钢锭、钢坯自己在滚道上前后奔跑，左右翻转，来回挤轧，从短的变成长的，从不整齐的变成整齐的，然后自动顺着滚道跑到下一工序。人呢？我们只在一段和一段中间的小玻璃屋内找到两三个。他们坐在凳子上像汽车司机一样扳动这个或那个操纵杆，使小屋外的巨大机器和钢锭按自己的意图动作。通红的钢锭发散出来的高热，不能侵袭到他们。这和工人们用钎子夹红钢锭相比，不仅是轻快、舒适，而且安全得多了。我们都为工人们庆幸。但是，在经理沃伦诺夫和其他负责人谈话中，他们都不满意这样的自动化水平。他们现在的奋斗目标，是在尽短的时期内把称量车的操纵者、装料机的操纵者、初轧机操纵台上的操纵工，都用自动化操纵装置来代替；加热炉和轧钢的中间过程，也用自动装置联结起来；轧完以后的钢材加工、矫正等过程，都要自动化。这也是第六个五年计划和最近在马格尼托哥尔斯克召开的全苏黑色冶金工业自动化会议对这个公司的要求。经理说：“不是这样，就算不得完全的自动化。只能算90％的自动化。”
    经理还告诉我们：公司的设计机构现在大大加强了。为实现自动化和远距离操纵，设计机构中还特设了设备自动化组。为了便于远距离操纵和观察，第一台工业用的电视装置，最近已经设计好并且制造了出来。我们被领到电视室参观的时候，电视机上出现的是轧钢车间的情景：钢锭在滚道上跑，吊车从空中驰过……。旁边的桌上，安装着一、二百个电钮。负责人要检查和了解哪个车间、工段的工作，就扳动哪个电钮，那个车间、工段的情景立即在电视机上出现。不过，这个设备现在还在进一步试验、改进，目的是使它更清楚，更合乎理想。此外，厂内还在建立完全普遍的无线电联系，目的是使工厂的负责人可以同所有的司机、操纵工、调度站都能随时用无线电通话。
    苏联的科学家、学者、也在围绕着自动化和远距离操纵的目标而进行着巨大的研究工作。许多大学成立了专门的自动化和远距离操纵的教研室；科学研究机关在帮助建立许多生产自动化装置的工厂。在列宁格勒，我们访问了专门研究电气自动化和远距离操纵问题的教授法捷也夫博士。他告诉我们，他们正在加紧研究无线电控制和操纵整个生产过程的问题。现在要求的自动化装置，不仅要能够自动检验加工件是否合乎规格，不合就自动发出信号（灯亮或铃响等）；还要能够自动调整。他兴奋地告诉我们，有一种车床速度自动调整的装置，现在已经试验成功。关于远距离操纵，他们现在已经能够从列宁格勒控制二百公里到四百公里以外的斯维里耶和沃洛霍夫等地的水电站。
    所有这些，都使我感觉到苏联人民正在创造一个历史上最伟大的世纪——工人和工程师的劳动将失去界线。每一个人都将从单纯的倦人的体力劳动中彻底解放出来，并且把一切不大需要花费脑力的工作通通交给机器去作。人类只做创造性的工作，每一个人的聪明才智都将加速发展。那时候，真正的“人”的生活将是每一个人都能享受的。
