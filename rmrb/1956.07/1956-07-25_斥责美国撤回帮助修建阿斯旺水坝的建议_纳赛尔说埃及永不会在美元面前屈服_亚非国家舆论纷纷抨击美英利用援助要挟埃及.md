Xinhua News Agency, July 24th dispatch from Cairo: Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser today accused the United States of withdrawing its offer to help Egypt build the Aswan Dam. He said: Egypt will build the Aswan Dam for its dignity and prestige, "much to the disappointment of the West."

In a speech at the inauguration ceremony of an oil refinery near Cairo, Abdel Nasser cited figures to prove the stability of the Egyptian economy. He accused the Washington authorities of "shamelessly asserting that our (Egypt's) economy is unstable."

He said: "If a clamor in Washington, shamelessly and regardless of the principles of international relations between countries, creates some fabricated and deceptive remarks, saying that the Egyptian economy is unsound and casting shadows of doubt on it—then, I want to say to those hiding behind this clamor, 'Let your hatred suffocate you. You will never be able to control us, because we know our path.'"

The Egyptian President said: "We will never succumb to the power of the dollar." More than 22 million Egyptians "will fully oppose any attempt at foreign interference, whether it is political, military, or economic."

Xinhua News Agency, July 24th dispatch from Damascus: Syrian Prime Minister al-Assali said on the 23rd that the reason why the United States and Britain withdrew their earlier offers to help Egypt build the Aswan Dam was because Egypt decided not to allow others to interfere in its internal affairs.

Al-Assali said he believed that this decision by the United States and Britain would not hinder Egypt's "new national construction policy."

Xinhua News Agency dispatch from Cairo: Cairo Radio commented on July 22nd that the purpose of the United States and Britain withdrawing their offer to finance the construction of the Aswan Dam in Egypt was to "exert pressure on the Egyptian government's independent policy."

The commentary warned: "The Western bloc, which claims to be the free world, must understand that Egypt will adhere to an independent and autonomous policy and will continue to oppose foreign interference and strive for peaceful coexistence among all countries in the world."

The "Al-Ahram" published an editorial on the same day saying: "If Egypt must wait many years to build the High Dam with Egyptian funds, then Egypt is willing to wait. Egypt would rather move forward more slowly than sacrifice any national rights."

"Al-Gomhuria" said on July 21st, "It would be wise for the United States to learn a good lesson from its refusal to arm the Egyptian army. The U.S. refusal did not prevent Egypt from obtaining arms from elsewhere."

Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, July 23rd: The "Hindustan Standard" editorial on July 22nd accused the United States and Britain of withdrawing their offer to help Egypt build the Aswan Dam in a manner that was an "unscrupulous act."

The editorial said: "In fact, given that Western countries are very blatantly trying to buy friendship with aid, it would be very naive for Egypt and any other country that has not assumed obligations to rely entirely on the promises of aid from Western countries."

Xinhua News Agency, Rangoon, July 24th: The "Guardian" said on the 22nd that the Americans "seem to think that when they give aid to countries around the world, they should have some say. In any case, what a stupid idea, who do they think they are?"

The newspaper pointed out: Burma will now face difficulties in obtaining aid. First, senior U.S. leaders condemned neutralism one after another. Then they stopped aid to Egypt for building the Aswan High Dam. The newspaper said that it is impossible to imagine that Burma's social form is in line with the American view.

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, July 23rd: "Republik" commented today on the United States' withdrawal of its offer to finance Egypt's Aswan Dam project, saying that the myth that U.S. aid does not come with political conditions that harm others has now been exposed.

The newspaper concluded that it is very important to recognize the essence of so-called U.S. aid, because Indonesia also wants to build its huge projects.

Xinhua News Agency, Karachi, July 24th: The "Pakistan Times" published an editorial on July 22nd saying that because the U.S. and British governments have decided to withdraw their offer of financial and technical assistance to Egypt's Aswan Dam, every step taken by Western countries towards underdeveloped countries will now be met with greater suspicion.

The newspaper said that the main purpose of the U.S. and British actions seems to be to punish Egypt because Egypt has adopted a neutralist attitude in the "Cold War," trades with socialist countries, recognizes China, and, in short, because Egypt does not agree to treat Dulles as a guide in formulating foreign and trade policies. They probably also hope that Egypt will be forced to return to the Western leaders with a begging bowl, and President Abdel Nasser may then be willing to accept the conditions originally proposed by the United States due to dire need.

    斥责美国撤回帮助修建阿斯旺水坝的建议
    纳赛尔说埃及永不会在美元面前屈服
    亚非国家舆论纷纷抨击美英利用援助要挟埃及
    新华社24日讯　开罗消息：埃及总统加麦尔·阿卜杜勒·纳赛尔今天指责美国撤回帮助埃及建造阿斯旺水坝的建议。他说：埃及将为了它的尊严和威信而把阿斯旺水坝建造起来，“让西方大失所望”。
    阿卜杜勒·纳赛尔在开罗近郊一个炼油厂的落成典礼上发表演说时，列举了数字来证明埃及经济的稳定。他指责华盛顿当局“无耻地断言我们（埃及）的经济不稳定”。
    他说：“如果在华盛顿的一阵叫嚣不知羞耻而且不顾国家之间的国际关系的原则，制造出一些虚构的迷惑人的言论，说埃及的经济是不健全的，并且对它散布怀疑的阴影——那末，我要向那些藏在这种叫嚣后面的人说，‘让你们的憎恨把你们自己窒息而死吧。你们是决不能够控制我们的，因为我们知道我们的道路’。”
    埃及总统说：“我们永远不会在美元的权力面前屈服”。二千二百多万埃及人“将全力反对任何外国干涉的企图，无论那是政治的、军事的或经济的”。
    据新华社24日讯　大马士革消息：叙利亚总理阿萨利二十三日说，美国和英国所以撤回它们早先提出的帮助埃及修建阿斯旺水坝的建议，是因为埃及决定不允许别人再干涉它的内政。
    阿萨利说，他相信美国和英国的这个决定妨碍不了埃及的“新的国家建设方针”。
    据新华社讯　开罗消息：开罗电台七月二十二日评论说，美国和英国撤回资助埃及建造阿斯旺水坝的建议的目的，在于“对埃及政府的独立政策施加压力”。
    评论警告说：“妄以自由世界自居的西方集团必须懂得：埃及将坚持奉行独立自主的政策，并且将继续反对外国干涉，为世界各国的和平共处而奋斗。”
      “金字塔报”同一天发表社论说：“假如埃及必须等待许多年用埃及的资金来修建高水坝的话，那么埃及愿意等待。埃及宁愿前进得慢一些，而不愿牺牲任何民族权利。”
      “共和国报”七月二十一日说，“美国要是从它拒绝武装埃及军队的事件中很好地吸取教训，那将是明智的。美国的拒绝并没有妨碍埃及从别的地方取得军火。”
    据新华社新德里23日电　“印度斯坦旗报”七月二十二日社论指责美国和英国撤回援助埃及建设阿斯旺水坝的建议的方式是一种“不诚实的行径”。
    社论说：“事实上，鉴于西方国家非常露骨地想用援助来收买友谊，埃及和其他任何没有承担义务的国家如果要完全依赖西方国家给予援助的诺言将是非常天真的。”
    据新华社仰光24日电　“卫报”二十二日说，美国人“似乎认为，当他们给予世界各国以援助的时候，他们应该有一些发言权。无论如何，这是多么愚蠢的想法，他们认为自己是什么人呢？”
    这家报纸指出：缅甸现在要取得援助将遭到困难。首先，美国高级领袖们纷纷谴责中立主义。接着他们停止援助埃及建筑阿斯旺高水坝。这家报纸说，怎样想像也不能认为缅甸的社会形态是符合美国的看法的。
    据新华社雅加达23日电　“共和国报”今天就美国撤销资助埃及的阿斯旺水坝的工程的建议一事发表评论说，所谓美国的援助并不附有危害别人的政治条件，这种神话现在被揭穿了。
    这家报纸最后说，认识所谓美国援助的实质是非常重要的，因为印度尼西亚也要建筑它的巨大的工程。
    据新华社喀喇蚩24日电　“巴基斯坦时报”七月二十二日发表社论说，由于美英两国政府决定撤回给予埃及阿斯旺水坝以财政和技术援助的建议，西方国家现在对不发达国家所采取的每一个步骤，将受到更大的怀疑。
    这家报纸说，美英的行动的主要目的似乎是惩罚埃及，因为埃及在“冷战”中采取了中立主义态度，同社会主义国家进行贸易，承认中国，总而言之，因为埃及不同意在制定外交政策和贸易政策时把杜勒斯当作指导者。它们大概还希望，埃及将会被迫带着讨饭碗回到西方领袖们那里去，阿卜杜勒·纳赛尔总统那时候可能会由于十分需要而准备接受美国原先提出的条件。
