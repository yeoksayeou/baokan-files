    鞍钢炼铁厂大力降低成本
    上半年平均每天节约一万多元
    新华社鞍山15日电　鞍山钢铁公司炼铁厂在今年上半年平均每天给国家节约一万三千多元的财富，六个月完成的成本金额，总共比国家计划降低二百四十万元以上。这是十三日炼铁厂编制出来的上半年成本决算汇总表里公布的。
    炼铁厂今年上半年的成本计划，是按照四年完成五年计划的要求编制的，比去年的成本指标降低了14％；计划编出经过职工讨论以后，又提出了全年再给国家节约二百一十三万元的计划。
    炼铁厂职工的技术水平提高了。高炉上的职工推广了先进经验，提高了高炉的温度以后，半年所节约的焦炭，可以用来再炼两万多吨生铁。著名劳动模范孟泰所在的设备系统，回收大量废钢铁，代替了新的钢铁料，平均每月节省消耗费一万多元。
