    Malediction Cannot Replace Serious Criticism
    On July 5th, two short articles signed Wang Pu were published simultaneously on the second and third pages of the People's Daily. Their insolent attitude made people very uncomfortable. The article "Good Method, Good Attitude" simply reiterated the article "Service Methods Welcomed by Customers" published the day before and the day before that, and at the end, it said, "I hope... everyone will pay attention to the article published today"! Such a self-congratulatory tone is really sickening. The article "Lost and Found" quoted half of a reader's letter, to which the author added embellishments, full of insolent words, beginning by saying, "Their behavior is sometimes surprisingly bad," and later scolding people as "spendthrifts."
    It is undeniably correct that the People's Daily should strengthen its combat effectiveness and boldly intervene in life; but "combat" and "intervention" are not equivalent to arrogance and abuse. Opening one's mouth to say "bad beyond belief" and closing it to say "spendthrift" really cannot replace serious criticism.
                      (Wang Rujun)
      Editor: Comrade Wang Rujun's opinion is correct, and we will strive to strengthen editorial work and improve the style of the newspaper. In the article "Good Method, Good Attitude," the sentence "I hope... everyone will pay attention to the article published today" is a mistake for "I hope... everyone will pay attention to the article 'Service Methods Welcomed by Customers' published the day before yesterday and yesterday." We hereby correct it.

### 漫骂不能代替严肃的批评

    漫骂不能代替严肃的批评
    七月五日人民日报二版和三版上同时登了两篇署名王朴的短文，其出言不逊的态度，使人看了很不舒服。“好方式，好态度”那篇，只是重述了昨、前天发表的“受到顾客欢迎的服务方式”一文，而且在最后还说：“希望……都重视今天发表的这篇文章”！这样自我推崇的口气，实在使人腻烦。“失物招领”那篇，全文一半是引用一篇读者来信，作者加头添尾，充满不逊之词，开头说，“他们的行为有时是出奇的坏”，后来又骂人家是“败家子”。
    人民日报加强战斗性，大胆干预生活，这是无可争辩的正确；但“战斗”和“干预”不等于骄横和谩骂，张嘴“坏得出奇”，闭口“败家子”，实在不能代替严肃的批评。
                      （王汝俊）
      编者：王汝俊同志所提的意见是正确的，我们将努力加强编
  辑工作、改进报纸的文风。“好方式，好态度”一文中“希望…
  …都重视今天发表的这篇文章”一句，是“希望……都重视前昨
  两天发表的‘受到顾客欢迎的服务方式’这篇文章”之误，特此
  更正。
