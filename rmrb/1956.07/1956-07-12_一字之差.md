    A Difference of One Word
    In April of this year, Li Baiqin, an accountant at the Jinan Urban Construction Engineering School, asked Comrade Zhang of the Jinan No. 1 Machine Tool Factory to purchase 40 yuan worth of ledger pages in Beijing on her behalf. On May 2nd, Comrade Zhang mailed the ledger pages from Beijing. Usually, mail from Beijing to Jinan takes three to five days to arrive. However, this time, the mailed ledger pages had not arrived even after a month. Li Baiqin was very anxious and went to the Jinan Post Office to inquire five times. Each time, the reply was: "We have never received such a package, it may have been misdirected by the Beijing Post Office." Later, after Li and Zhang inquired in Jinan and Beijing, they finally found it among the printed materials of the Design Office of the Shandong Provincial Urban Construction Bureau.
    It turned out that this mail arrived at the sorting section of the Jinan Post Office on May 5th. The comrades in the sorting section did not look carefully at the addressee's address, made a stroke of the pen, and mistakenly changed "Section 24" into "Section 28." The postman did not check the delivery address and delivered it to the Design Office of the Shandong Provincial Urban Construction Bureau according to "Section 28." The receiver of the Design Office of the Shandong Provincial Urban Construction Bureau, regardless of whether there was such a person, "received all incoming mail" and put the mail in the pile of printed materials in the secretarial section. A misdirected mail, thus broke through three barriers, but no one discovered it.
    "Twenty-four" and "Twenty-eight" differ by only one word, but because of this one word difference, Li Baiqin sent four letters, made a long-distance call, and also delayed matters.

    一字之差
    今年四月，济南城市建设工程学校的会计员李百沁托济南第一机床厂的张同志到北京代买四十元的账页子。五月二日张同志就把账页子从北京寄了出来。通常，北京寄往济南的邮件三五天就可到达。可是这次寄出的账页子一个月过去了，还无音信。李百沁很着急，先后到济南邮局询问了五次，每次得到的回答总是：“我们从来没有收到这样的包裹，可能是北京邮局寄错了”。以后经李、张两同志在济南、北京多方查询，最后终于在山东省城市建设局设计室的印刷品中找到了。
    原来，这份邮件五月五日就到了济南邮局分检科。分检科的同志也不细看收件人的住址，提笔一画，就把二十四段错成二十八段。邮递员也没有核对交件地址，就按二十八段送到山东省城市建设局设计室。山东省城市建设局设计室的收发员也不管有无此人，“来件必收”，把邮件放到秘书科的印刷品堆中去了。一个错投的邮件，就这样连闯三关，还是无人发现。
    “二十四”、“二十八”仅有一字之差，但是就为这一字之差，李百沁就发了四封信，打了一次长途电话，还耽误了事情。
