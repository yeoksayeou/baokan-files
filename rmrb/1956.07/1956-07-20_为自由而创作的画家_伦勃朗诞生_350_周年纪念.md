    The painter who created for freedom
    ——Commemorating the 350th Anniversary of Rembrandt's Birth——

    "More important than money is reputation," "More important than reputation is freedom." This sentence is a red thread that runs through Rembrandt's lifelong struggle, a beacon that illuminates his life attitude, his thoughts and feelings, his ideals, and his artistic creation.
    In the early 17th century, after a long and arduous struggle, the Dutch people liberated themselves from the brutal rule of Spanish feudal autocracy, declared independence, and won the victory of the world's first bourgeois democratic revolution, which was an infinitely glorious achievement of the Dutch people.
    Rembrandt's genius and his artistic creation grew up in the era when culture and art tended to flourish after the victory of the Dutch Revolution. At that time, the Dutch people used the enthusiasm of the democratic revolution and the free thought of national liberation to nourish Dutch art and culture, and this popular and democratic thought and feeling deeply nurtured Rembrandt and was embodied in his profound realistic art creation.
    Rembrandt was a great Dutch painter of the 17th century, a genius master of portrait painting, historical painting, genre painting, and landscape painting, and at the same time an outstanding and original printmaker.
    Throughout his life, he showed unparalleled concern for the poor and suffering people, and resolutely resisted the dark forces of society. Therefore, his works are full of deep sympathy for the people and humanitarian spirit; and with his original artistic style, he moved countless audiences.
    Rembrandt Harmenszoon van Rijn was born in Leiden, Holland, on July 15, 1606. He was the son of a miller. He first studied at Leiden University, then turned to painting, and studied with the painters Jan van Swanenburgh and Pieter Lastman. He began working independently in 1625, moved to Amsterdam in 1632, and married Saskia in 1634, spending ten years of happy life.
    Rembrandt's early works mostly took portrait paintings and biblical stories as themes, and were influenced by his teacher Lastman, with the decorative interest of "Baroque" style. But from his early works, he had already begun to realistically and sympathetically depict the images of the poor, vagrants, and working people.
    In 1632, Rembrandt became famous for painting "The Anatomy Lesson of Dr. Tulp," and he jumped to become the first-class painter in Amsterdam. In this group portrait, he realistically and profoundly revealed the serious and earnest research spirit of the medical scientists. In this painting, he boldly adopted a plot-based processing method, depicting the scene of Dr. Tulp and a group of students performing an autopsy around the corpse at a moment. Through the description of the young doctors listening attentively to the old professor's lecture, the portrait painting has the meaning of genre painting, forming a concentrated and unified composition, and beginning to apply the method of chiaroscuro contrast to large-scale creation.
    Since then, Rembrandt has received a large number of orders from all sides. The representative works of this period include: "Painter and His Wife Saskia", "Scholar Sitting Under a Revolving Staircase", "Christ Taken Down from the Cross", "Danaë", and "Landscape with a Stone Bridge", etc. His characteristics in this period are: expressing the character of lively characters, noble and exciting qualities. Using precise and meticulous depiction techniques, expressing the vitality of people and the rhythm of nature.
    In the creation of the commemorative group portrait of Captain Banning Cocq's shooting squad (later known as "The Night Watch"), Rembrandt failed to meet the requirements of the client who liked to paint the characters flat, trivial, and smooth like a photograph, but used the method of historical genre painting to deal with it. He described the scene of the shooters rushing out on an emergency mission, full of heroism and intense momentum, arousing people's glorious memories of the Dutch people's liberation struggle not long ago. The client asked the painter to modify it according to their vulgar taste, but Rembrandt resolutely refused.
    From then on, the endless stream of orders was interrupted. In the same year, his beloved wife Saskia passed away. In order to adhere to his artistic ideals and the belief of creative freedom, Rembrandt resolutely did not compromise with vulgar artistic tastes. So he closed his door and did not go out, he would rather paint for the poor, vagrants, farmers, and relatives and friends without pay, and he accepted small-scale copperplate engravings and book illustrations to maintain his hard creative career. In the mid-1940s, with the help of his second wife, Stoffels, he was able to smoothly create according to his original artistic style.
    Starting from the 1940s, it can be said to be the mature period of Rembrandt's art. During this period, it was more profound, deeper, and more moving than his earlier works, full of humanistic warmth. The representative works of this period include "The Holy Family", "The Good Samaritan", "The Adoration of the Shepherds", "Christ at Emmaus", and the famous portrait "Man with a Golden Helmet", portraits of his relatives and friends and himself, as well as several outstanding landscapes and copperplate engravings.
    In the works of this period, Rembrandt used deeper feelings than in the early days to describe those heroes from the people and the suffering people. He praised their mutual help and love, praised the nobility of working life and the virtues of the working people. He wrote myths and biblical stories as if they were events that happened in daily life, and the daily life of ordinary people can also be treated as biblical and mythological themes. For example, depicting a carpenter's family as the "Holy Family", in "The Good Samaritan", Christ is rescued in the posture of a sufferer. Marx said that Rembrandt "painted the Virgin as a Dutch peasant woman," and in his view, Dutch peasant women could also become the Virgin. In order to more deeply express the thoughts and feelings of ordinary people, the painter used the method of psychological analysis to reveal the subtle changes in the characters' moods, and even in the landscape paintings of this period, he also depicted the ever-changing wind and clouds of nature, making the landscape paintings rich in wonderful fantasy and poetry.
    In 1656, another heavy blow was pressed on Rembrandt. The court declared him a debtor who was unable to repay his debts, and auctioned off all his property, creations, houses, and precious collections collected for creation. Rembrandt lost everything and had to be forced to move to the slums. But misfortunes never come singly. In 1662, his second wife Stoffels passed away, and in 1668, his beloved son Titus passed away. In his later years, in order to pay off debts, the artist had to engage in creation in an extremely poor environment, with extremely weak eyesight and heart.
    But all these serious blows failed to destroy the artist's tenacious creative energy. On the contrary, in the last ten years of Rembrandt's life, his artistic creativity was brought into play to an unprecedented peak. In his later years, the more his creation was free from external interference, the more he could move forward along the path he explored, and the more clearly he established his unique artistic style. His representative works in his later years include: "The Anatomy Lesson of Dr. Deijman", "Christ and the Woman of Samaria", "Aristotle Contemplating the Bust of Homer", "David Playing the Harp Before Saul", "The Adoration of the Magi", "The Syndics of the Drapers' Guild", "The Conspiracy of Claudius Civilis" (unfinished), and the last work "The Return of the Prodigal Son", etc. In his later years, he summarized his lifelong creative experience, used extremely concise expression techniques and psychological descriptions to depict the complex and rich inner life of the characters, and used his eyes and mind that had tasted the bitterness of life to depict the dramatic conflicts of joy and sorrow in people's lives.
    In the last few years of his life, he painted "The Conspiracy of Claudius Civilis", which is a large historical painting depicting the Batavians, the ancestors of the Dutch, plotting an uprising against the Romans in the year 69 AD. From the unfinished manuscript, we can already see that he was describing the heroic scene of the Dutch ancestors swearing an oath during the conspiracy of the uprising, showing their glorious tradition of fighting for freedom and liberation. It can be seen from the picture that his rough and bold style in his later years, as well as the solid realistic expression techniques, aroused the dissatisfaction of the city hall and was once again rejected by the client.
    On October 4, 1669, Rembrandt died in poverty and loneliness, but he left behind about 600 oil paintings, more than 1,300 prints, and about 2,000 sketches and drawings for later generations. In the decades after his death, his works were not valued. It was not until the mid-18th century that his artistic value began to be respected. In the 19th and 20th centuries, his artistic value was truly understood, giving a huge impact on the history of modern European painting.
    The most unique technique in Rembrandt's artistic style is the expression method of chiaroscuro contrast and chiaroscuro penetration. Although he has never been abroad, he has been deeply influenced by Italian Renaissance masters such as Da Vinci, Correggio, and Caravaggio. However, chiaroscuro contrast has gained a new artistic language in Rembrandt's paintings, because in Rembrandt's view, the universe is not a limited entity, but an endless world combined with infinite space and time. Therefore, in his paintings, the light source only focuses on the most important theme, secondary things often reveal some weak light in the shadows, and all other unimportant things disappear in the darkness.
    In Rembrandt's view, light is the basis of all images and colors. Color is the continuous movement of light and dark color blocks with the change of light. Due to the mutual penetration of light and color, color produces wonderful flickering brilliance on Rembrandt's paintings.
    In order to make light and color consistent, Rembrandt sometimes uses dense and deep brushstrokes, sometimes uses rough and bold brushstrokes, sometimes piles bright colors into small hills, and sometimes uses flat coating methods to render. But all these expression techniques are not rigid formulas for Rembrandt, but in order to better, more clearly, and more perfectly express the theme, and due to the variety of expression content, the expression techniques and expression methods he uses are also ever-changing.
    As a great democrat and a painter who created for freedom, Rembrandt enriched the treasure house of human culture and art with his solid and powerful realistic painting art, leaving us with a rich and colorful painting heritage.
    Although he has left us for nearly 300 years, his spirit of fighting for democracy and freedom, and his brilliant achievements in creating for the people, will always remain in the world and will always inspire us to strive for the great ideals of freedom, peace, and happiness for all mankind!
    The name of the great Rembrandt has long been familiar to Chinese artists. His lofty ideals and his brilliant achievements in art can still be used as a great force to encourage Chinese artists to engage in artistic creation until our time.

    为自由而创作的画家
    ——伦勃朗诞生350周年纪念——
    许幸之
    “比金钱更重要的是名誉”、“比名誉更重要的是自由。”这句话，是贯彻伦勃朗奋斗一生的一根红线，是照耀他一生的生活态度、他的思想感情、他的理想、他的艺术创作的一盏明灯。
    十七世纪初叶，荷兰人民经过了长期的艰苦斗争，从残暴的西班牙封建专制的统治下解放出来，宣布独立，而赢得世界上第一次资产阶级民主革命的胜利，这是荷兰人民无限光荣的战果。
    伦勃朗的天才和他的艺术创作，就是在荷兰革命取得胜利之后，文化艺术趋向繁荣的时代成长起来的。那时荷兰正以民主革命的热情和民族解放的自由思想营养了荷兰的艺术文化，而这种人民的、民主的思想感情，深深地培育了伦勃朗，并从他的深刻的现实主义艺术创作中体现了出来。
    伦勃朗是十七世纪荷兰的伟大画家，是天才的肖像画、历史画、风俗画、风景画大师，同时是卓越的富于独创性的版画家。
    他的一生，对贫困和受难的人民表现了无比的关怀，而对于社会的黑暗势力则表示坚决反抗。因此，他的作品充满了对人民的深厚的同情和人道主义精神；并以他独创的艺术风格，感动了无数观众。
    伦勃朗·哈门斯·范·兰于1606年7月15日诞生于荷兰的莱丁城，他是一个磨坊主的儿子。先在莱丁大学读书，后转而学画，曾先后与当时的画家扬·凡·斯瓦宁堡和彼得·拉斯特曼学过画。从1625年起便开始独立工作，后于1632年迁居阿姆斯特丹，1634年和莎斯卡娅结婚，从此度过他幸福生活的十年。
    伦勃朗的早期作品，多半以肖像画和圣经故事为题材，因受业师拉斯特曼的影响，带有“巴洛克”风格的装饰趣味。但从他早期的作品中，已经开始真实地、富于同情心地描写穷人、流浪者和劳动人民的形象。
    1632年，伦勃朗因画了“杜尔普博士的解剖课”而著名，便一跃而成为阿姆斯特丹的第一流画家了。在这幅群像画里，他真实而深刻地揭示了医学家们认真而严肃的研究精神。在这幅画里，他大胆地采用了情节性的处理方法，把杜尔普医生和一群学生围绕着尸体进行解剖时一刹那的情景，通过年轻医生们专心倾听老教授讲学的描写，使肖像画具有了风俗画的意义，形成了集中而统一的构图，并开始把明暗对比的方法运用到巨幅创作中来。
    从此，伦勃朗获得来自各方面的大量订件，在这时期的代表作品中有：“画家及其妻莎斯卡娅”、“坐在旋转扶梯下的学者”、“从十字架上取下来的基督”、“丹娜亚”，以及“有石桥的风景”等，他在这一时期的特点是：表现生气勃勃的人物的性格，崇高和激动人心的品德。用精确、细致的描写手法，表现那种朝气蓬勃的人和自然界的动律。
    伦勃朗在绘制班宁·柯克大尉射击手连（后被称为“夜巡”）的纪念群像的创作中，未能满足订件者所喜欢的那样，把人物画得平板、琐碎、光滑得如同照相一般的要求，而用历史风俗画的方法来加以处理，他描写了射击手们因紧急任务而匆忙出动，充满了英雄气概和激烈动势的场面，引起人们对于不久以前荷兰人民进行解放斗争的光荣回忆。订件者要求画家按照他们的庸俗趣味进行修改，但被伦勃朗坚决拒绝。
    从此，源源不断的订件中断了。同年，他的爱妻莎斯卡娅逝世。伦勃朗为了坚持自己的艺术理想和创作自由的信念，决不和庸俗的艺术趣味妥协。于是闭门不出，他宁愿为穷人、流浪者、农民，以及亲属知友们无代价地画画，自己则接受小幅铜版画和书籍插图来维持艰苦的创作生涯。到四十年代中期，得到他的后妻斯托斐尔斯的帮助，才顺利地按照自己独创的艺术风格进行创作。
    从四十年代开始，可以说是伦勃朗艺术的成熟期。在这一时期比他早期的作品格外深刻、深沉、感动人心，充满了人道主义的温情。在这一时期的代表作品中有“圣家族”、“善良的萨马利亚人”、“牧羊人的朝拜”、“基督在爱马乌斯”，以及著名的肖像画“戴金盔的人”，他的亲友和他自己的画像，以及若干杰出的风景和铜版画。
    在这一时期的作品中，伦勃朗比早期用更深厚的感情，描写那些来自民间的英雄和受难的人民，他歌颂他们互助友爱，歌颂劳动生活的高尚和劳动人民的美德。他把神话和圣经故事写成好像是日常生活中所发生的事情，而普通人的日常生活也可以作为圣经和神话题材来处理。例如把木匠的家庭当做“圣家族”来描写，在“善良的萨马利亚人”里面，基督是以一个受难者的姿态被人搭救的。马克思说，伦勃朗“把圣母画成尼德兰农妇的样子”，而尼德兰农妇在他看来也都可能成为圣母。画家为了更深地表达普通人的思想感情，他运用了心理分析的方法，揭示人物心情的微妙变化，甚至在这一时期的风景画中，也在描写大自然变幻莫测的风云，使风景画富有美妙的幻想和诗意。
    1656年，又一次沉重的打击压在伦勃朗身上，法庭宣判他为没有能力偿还债款的负债人，把他的全部财产、创作、房屋，以及为创作而搜集起来的珍贵收藏品全部拍卖了，伦勃朗失去了所有一切，不得不被迫迁居到贫民窟中去居住。可是祸不单行，1662年，他的后妻斯托斐尔斯逝世，1668年，爱子提多斯逝世。晚年，艺术家为了清偿债务，不得不在极端贫困的环境中，在目力和心脏极端衰弱的情况下从事创作。
    但这一切严重的打击，都没有能摧毁艺术家的顽强的创作精力。相反地，在伦勃朗一生的最后十年，他的艺术创造力倒反而发挥到前所未有的高峰。在晚年，他的创作愈是不受外界的干扰，愈能依循自己所探索的道路前进，便愈加明确地树立起自己所特有的艺术风格来。在他晚期的代表作品中有：“德曼医师的解剖课”、“基督与萨马利亚的妇人”、“注视着荷马雕像的亚里斯多德”、“在扫罗王面前弹琴的大卫”、“博士来拜”、“呢布业工会的理事们”、“朱理·齐维里斯的密谋”（未完稿），以及最后的作品“浪子回家”等。晚年，他总结了他毕生的创作经验，用极其简练的表现手法和心理描写，刻划了人物的复杂而又丰富的内心生活，用他饱尝人生辛酸的目光和心情，来描绘人们生活中那种悲欢离合的戏剧性冲突。
    在他生命的最后几年，他绘制了“朱理·齐维里斯的密谋”，这是一幅描写荷兰的祖先巴达维亚人于公元六十九年时密谋起义反抗罗马人的巨幅历史画，从未完成的画稿中我们已经可以看出，他是在描写荷兰祖先们在密谋起义时宣誓的英雄场面，表现了他们争取自由解放的光荣传统。从画面上可以看出他晚年粗犷、大胆的作风，以及坚实的现实主义的表现手法，引起了市政厅的不满而再度遭到订件人的拒绝接受。
    1669年10月4日，伦勃朗在穷困和寂寞中逝世了，但他却给后世留下大约六百幅油画，一千三百余幅版画，二千幅左右的速写和素描。而在他死后的几十年内，他的作品还没有被人重视，一直到十八世纪中叶，他的艺术价值开始被人尊重，到了十九、二十世纪，他的艺术价值才真正被人所理解，给欧洲近代绘画史上以巨大的影响。
    在伦勃朗的艺术风格中最独特的技法，就是明暗对比和明暗渗透的表现方法。他虽没有出过国门一步，但却深深受到意大利文艺复兴大师如达·芬奇、柯尔列乔、卡拉瓦乔等人的深刻影响。但是明暗对比却在伦勃朗的绘画中获得了新的艺术语言，因为宇宙在伦勃朗看来并不是一个有限的实体，而是无限的空间和时间相结合的无止境的世界，所以在他的画面上，光源只集中地照耀在最重要的主题上，次要的东西往往在阴影中显露一些微弱的光亮，而其他一切无关重要的事物都消失在黑暗中。
    光，在伦勃朗看来是一切形象和色彩的依据，色彩是随着光线的变化而产生明暗色块的连续运动，由于光和色彩的互相渗透的作用，色彩在伦勃朗的画面上就产生了奇妙的闪动的光辉。
    为了使光与色彩趋于一致，所以在伦勃朗的笔法上有时采用稠密深厚的笔触，有时采用粗犷豪放的笔触，有时把明亮的色彩堆成小丘，有时则用平涂的方法加以渲染。但所有这一切表现手法对伦勃朗说来都不是死板的公式，而是为了更好、更明确、更完美地表达主题思想，并且由于表现内容的多种多样，因而他所使用的表现技巧和表现方法也是千变万化的。
    伦勃朗以一个伟大的民主主义者和为自由而创作的画家，用他坚实而有力的现实主义的绘画艺术给我们遗留下丰富多采的绘画遗产，因此而充实了人类文化艺术的宝库。
    他虽然离开我们将近300年，但是他为民主自由而战斗的精神，他为人民而创作的光辉的业绩，将永远留在人间，并且永远鼓舞着我们，为全人类的自由、和平、幸福的远大理想而奋斗！
    伟大伦勃朗的名字早已被中国的艺术家们所熟知，他的崇高理想和他在艺术上的光辉的成就，直到我们的时代，依然可以作为鼓舞我国艺术家从事艺术创作的伟大力量。
