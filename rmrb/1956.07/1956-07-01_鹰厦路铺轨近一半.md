Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, 27th. Before noon today, the Yingtan-Xiamen Railway had already laid track to Shaxian County in Fujian Province. So far, 344 kilometers of track have been laid, approaching half of the total length of the main line.

As the track-laying train sounded its first whistle in the northwestern suburbs of Shaxian County this morning, a tidal wave of people rushed to welcome it. People cheered enthusiastically, waving red flags. Some farmers from the mountainous areas had arrived in the city several days earlier, waiting to see the train.

    鹰厦路铺轨近一半
    新华社福州27日电　今天中午前，鹰潭—厦门铁路已经铺轨到福建省的沙县。至此已铺轨344公里，接近干线全长的一半。
    清晨，当铺轨列车在沙县城西北郊放出第一声汽笛时，潮涌般的人群赶往欢迎。人们热烈地欢呼着，摇着红旗。有些山区农民在几天以前就到了城里，等候看火车。
