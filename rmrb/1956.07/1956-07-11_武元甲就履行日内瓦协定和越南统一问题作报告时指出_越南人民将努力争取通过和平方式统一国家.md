Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, July 10th. Deputy Prime Minister and Commander-in-Chief of the Vietnam People's Army, General Võ Nguyên Giáp, delivered a report on the implementation of the Geneva Accords and the issue of Vietnamese unification at a mass rally in Hanoi on the evening of the 9th. Võ Nguyên Giáp said that the Vietnamese nation must be unified, and the Vietnamese people will struggle to continue implementing the Geneva Accords and to unify the fatherland through peaceful means.

The mass rally was presided over by Tôn Đức Thắng, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Vietnamese Fatherland Front. Representatives from the Vietnamese Fatherland Front, various Vietnamese political parties, people's organizations, and people from all walks of life in Hanoi, totaling 10,000 people, participated in the rally.

In his report, Võ Nguyên Giáp discussed the efforts made by the Vietnamese people over the past two years to thoroughly implement the Geneva Accords and strive for national unification. However, due to the conspiracy of the United States and the South Vietnamese authorities to permanently divide Vietnam, the nationwide free general election that should have been held in July this year could not be realized as scheduled. Võ Nguyên Giáp pointed out that the struggle for Vietnamese unification is part of the Vietnamese people's national democratic revolutionary struggle. This struggle will be long-term, arduous, and complex, but the Vietnamese people will resolutely continue to struggle to consolidate peace and achieve unification, and the entire Vietnam will certainly be unified.

The report also reviewed the great achievements made by North Vietnam in its recovery and construction in the two years since the restoration of peace. Võ Nguyên Giáp said that it is an arduous task to change the difficulties and backwardness caused by long-term colonial rule, but the Vietnamese people have already made great achievements in this regard.

The conference passed a telegram to the Vietnamese government and President Hồ Chí Minh, expressing their firm support for President Hồ's call to continue the struggle to implement the Geneva Accords and strive for national unification.
