Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 28th: The Japan-China Friendship Association yesterday sent representatives to the Japanese Foreign Ministry, Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, and other government agencies, demanding that the Japanese government promptly change the Japan-China Fisheries Agreement signed by private fishing groups into an agreement between governments. The association's request was made in accordance with the resolution of its recent Sixth National Congress.
The Japan-China Fisheries Council of Japan and the China Fisheries Association signed the Japan-China Private Fisheries Agreement in April 1955. Because this type of agreement is temporary in nature and has limitations, both groups hope that the fisheries agreement can be signed by the two governments.

    日中友协派代表到日本外务省等政府机关 
    要求把日中民间渔业协定改为政府间协定
    新华社28日讯　东京消息：日中友好协会昨天派代表到日本外务省、农林省和其他政府机关，要求日本政府迅速把民间渔业团体签订的日中渔业协定改变为政府之间的协定。协会的这个要求是根据它最近召开的第六届全国大会的决议提出的。
    日本的日中渔业协议会和中国渔业协会曾经在1955年4月签订了日中民间渔业协定，由于这种协定是临时性质的并且具有局限性，两个团体都希望能够由两国政府签订渔业协定。
