Xinhua News Agency, Dalian, July 29th. The Dalian Alkali Plant built a small dilute liquid tower for 11,000 yuan. As of the 27th, in the three and a half months since it was put into production, it has recovered 1,337 tons of soda ash from waste liquid, worth 334,250 yuan, which is more than 30 times the amount of investment.

In the past, the alkali content in the gas evaporated by the calcination furnace in the third workshop of the Dalian Alkali Plant during the calcination of soda ash flowed into the sea with the waste liquid. Since the completion of the small dilute liquid tower, an average of more than ten tons of soda ash can be recovered from the waste liquid every day. Soda ash is an important raw material for many light and heavy industries.

    从废液中回收工业原料
    新华社旅大29日电　大连碱厂用一万一千元建筑的一座小型淡液塔，到二十七日为止，在投入生产以后的三个半月内，从废液中回收了一千三百三十七吨纯碱，价值三十三万四千二百五十元，等于投资额的三十倍以上。
    大连碱厂第三车间锻烧炉在锻烧纯碱的时候，蒸发出的气体中含有大量的碱分。过去，这些碱分都随着废液流到海里。小型淡液塔建成以后，平均每天都能从废液中收回十多吨纯碱。纯碱是很多轻重工业的重要原料。
