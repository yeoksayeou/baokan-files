    "Sanqi" Herb Listed on the Market
    (Our newspaper reports) Yunnan's specialty medicinal material "Sanqi" has begun to be listed on the market. This year's "Sanqi" is growing well, and it is expected to increase production by about 50% compared to last year. "Sanqi" is a perennial plant that can only be harvested after being planted for three or four years. It can treat trauma and gynecological blood disorders. In addition to being sold throughout the country, it is also exported to Vietnam, Myanmar, and other countries.
    In order to reduce losses, the Yunnan Provincial Pharmaceutical Company has set up a temporary processing plant in Yanshan County, the place of origin of "Sanqi," this year; and changed the packaging from bags to boxes to avoid abrasion. The newly listed "Sanqi" is currently being shipped to Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, and other places for sale. (Zhang)

    药材“三七”上市
    本报讯　云南特产的药材“三七”开始上市。今年的“三七”生长良好，预计可比去年增产50％左右。“三七”是多年生植物，种植三、四年后，才可以收获。它可以治外伤和妇科血症，除行销国内各地外，还出口到越南，缅甸等国。
    云南省药材公司为了减少损耗，今年在“三七”产地砚山县设立了临时加工工场；并改袋装为箱装，以免磨损。目前新上市的“三七”正在陆续运往北京、天津、上海等地销售。　（章）
