Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, July 7th: The Standing Committee of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region held its sixth meeting yesterday.

The meeting was personally presided over by the Chairman of the Standing Committee, the Dalai Lama, and passed the following three proposals:

First, the proposal regarding the establishment of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) Tibet Committee;

Second, the proposal regarding the establishment of offices at all levels by the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region in various locations;

Third, the proposal regarding strengthening the connections between the various units under the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region and the various units under the Tibetan Local Government, the Panchen Kampus Assembly Hall Committee, and the Qamdo (昌都) People's Liberation Committee according to the nature of their work.

When reading the first proposal, the Dalai Lama said: The suggestion to establish the CPPCC Tibet Committee is to unite patriotic individuals and social elites from all aspects, religious sects, monasteries, and mass organizations in the Tibet region to participate in national political life and to study, in order to further consolidate and strengthen the anti-imperialist and patriotic united front in the Tibet region, so that it can play a role in the future construction of Tibet and the gradual implementation of democratic reforms.

According to the second proposal passed, the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region will establish Jiqiao (基巧) (equivalent to special districts) level offices in Lhasa, Shigatse, Qamdo, Nagqu, Takong, Lhokha, Gyantse, and Ngari in August this year. Then, based on the specific circumstances of each location, all Zong (宗) (equivalent to county) level offices will be established before the end of this year, creating conditions for the establishment of a unified Tibet Autonomous Region.

Both the Jiqiao-level and Zong-level offices are components of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region and are responsible for conveying and implementing the various resolutions and decisions of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region and its Standing Committee.

The third proposal points out that the various units under the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region—fourteen departments, committees, and offices—were all established by the end of June. It requires all relevant parties in Tibet to communicate information, learn from each other, and exchange experiences in their work.

    基巧级和宗级办事处都是西藏自治区筹备委员会的组成部分，负责传达和执行西藏自治区筹备委员会和常务委员会的各项决议和决定。
    第三个议案指出，西藏自治区筹备委员会所属各单位——十四个厅、委、处已在六月底全部成立，要求西藏各有关方面在工作中互通情况、互相学习，交流经验。
