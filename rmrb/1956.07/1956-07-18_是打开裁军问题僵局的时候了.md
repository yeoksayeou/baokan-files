    It's Time to Break the Stalemate on Disarmament

    The Fourth Session of the Fifth Meeting of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union passed an appeal to the parliaments of other countries on the issue of disarmament and issued a statement regarding the appeal from the Japanese Diet concerning the prohibition of nuclear weapons and the cessation of nuclear weapons testing. The meeting also approved the speech by Soviet Foreign Minister Shepilov recommending that the Soviet Union, the United States, and the United Kingdom quickly conclude an agreement on the immediate cessation of all atomic and thermonuclear weapon tests. These solemn peace documents will undoubtedly evoke a profound response in the parliaments of various countries and among peace-loving people of goodwill throughout the world.
    The Soviet Union has made unremitting efforts to achieve the reduction of armaments and the prohibition of nuclear weapons. At the recently concluded United Nations Disarmament Commission meeting in New York, Soviet representative Gromyko once again put forward new proposals for the reduction of armaments, the prohibition of nuclear weapons, the cessation of nuclear weapon tests, and, prior to that, guarantees by all countries not to use such weapons. This proposal was supported by Yugoslavia and India. Yugoslavia and India also put forward proposals at the meeting for the gradual reduction of armaments and the cessation of nuclear weapon tests. These proposals once again provided the possibility of breaking the deadlock on the issue of disarmament.
    However, the constructive initiatives put forward by the Soviet Union, Yugoslavia, and India on the issue of disarmament did not receive a corresponding response from Western countries. At this Disarmament Commission meeting, Western countries were preoccupied from the start with distorting the reasons why ten years of disarmament negotiations had failed to reach an agreement, and were intent on shifting the responsibility onto the Soviet Union. At the same time, they put forward a principled proposal that could only further complicate the issue of disarmament, in order to block the meeting from seeking any beneficial practical progress.
    Contrary to the attitude of the Western countries, led by the United States, which effectively obstructed the reaching of an agreement, the Soviet Union took new practical steps at this meeting to seek an agreement, expressing its willingness to accept the United States' proposal on the level of armed forces at the London meeting of the United Nations Disarmament Subcommittee. It is known that this is the second time the Soviet Union has accepted the disarmament figures proposed by Western countries. When the Soviet Union accepted the last figures proposed by Western countries last year, the Western countries abandoned their own proposal and then put forward a level that was much higher than the previous proposal.
    This new action taken by the Soviet Union to break the deadlock on the issue of disarmament has won a warm response from broad public opinion in various countries, and even Western countries cannot deny the fact of this new Soviet effort. British representative Nutting admitted that the above-mentioned Soviet proposal had "encouraging factors." Stassen, President of the United States' advisor on disarmament issues, also said that this was a moderate step towards reconciliation of the disarmament attitudes of the Soviet Union and the West. Since this is the case, Western countries have no reason not to take corresponding practical actions, thereby quickly achieving a first step agreement in areas where both sides have already reached agreement, in order to facilitate further reaching a comprehensive disarmament agreement. As the French "Liberation" pointed out: "The public will not agree to this situation: when a proposal that can be implemented is abandoned." However, all indications suggest that Western countries are creating new evasions.
    According to reports from Western news agencies, the fact that the Soviet Union once again agreed to the level of armed forces proposed by the West made Western countries feel "surprised." If a proposal is put forward in good faith in order to seek an agreement, it should be welcomed when the other party expresses agreement, so how could one feel surprised? Western news agency reports also said that because the Soviet Union had made this concession, the West would need to revise their proposal. This gives reason to suspect that the so-called concrete plan put forward by Western countries to reduce armed forces to a mutually agreed level is nothing more than a trick to placate public opinion. The facts provide a strong basis for this suspicion. The representatives of Western countries have already moved to new positions to fight their unpopular rearguard battle.
    Western country representatives are now saying that the level of armed forces proposed by Western countries that the Soviet Union has agreed to can only be accepted by the West if measures to stop the expansion of atomic weapons are taken at the same time. It was originally the Western countries who, because they opposed the Soviet Union's proposal to prohibit atomic weapons, put forward the proposition of reducing conventional armaments as a shield, but now they have turned it around. Regardless of how outdated this evasion is, the current footing of Western countries on the issue of prohibiting atomic weapons is also very unfavorable. In its new proposal, the Soviet Union is once again proposing at the same time the unconditional prohibition, destruction, and cessation of the manufacture of atomic and hydrogen weapons. The decision passed by the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union formally affirmed the Soviet government's position on the prohibition of nuclear weapons. But Western countries still resolutely oppose this proposal of the Soviet Union, insisting that it is a "deception." This practice of Western countries, saying east and pointing west, saying west and pointing east, is nothing more than trying to find an indecent cover for their strategy of evading agreement.
    The rigid attitude of Western countries has reached such a point that they even resolutely reject the proposal to cease nuclear weapon tests. As Indian Ambassador to the United Nations Menon pointed out, the whole world is expressing unease about nuclear weapon tests, and stopping these tests "would be the first step towards disarmament." However, US representative Wadsworth insisted that such tests were "absolutely essential" for their "security." In order to cover themselves up, Western countries put forward a proposal to "limit" nuclear weapon tests, however, as Menon rightly said, "Any limitation still retains the power of destruction." Moreover, even such a "limitation" proposal is to be implemented only in a later stage of disarmament. And first, a monitoring system including "aerial inspection" must be established and major international political problems resolved. This makes this proposal in practice a mere empty promise on paper. From this, it can be seen how afraid Western countries are of making any real progress in stopping the nuclear arms race.
    But this attitude of Western countries can only put themselves in a more unfavorable position. At present, the international tension is continuing to ease, and the policies of the "Cold War" and the arms race are becoming increasingly unpopular. The US wants to cover up its trick of obstructing the resolution of the disarmament issue by grandstanding about disarmament and peace, but that cannot deceive people. People are demanding that the US prove its sincerity with practical actions. Many countries that have followed the US in expanding armaments and preparing for war and have encountered economic difficulties, including Britain and France, have expressed their desire to reduce armaments, save military expenditure, and promote East-West relations, which is in line with the interests of these countries and world peace. People demand that they be consistent in their words and actions, and take beneficial steps to promote progress on the issue of disarmament.
    Due to the lack of sincerity of the Western countries, the New York meeting of the Disarmament Commission did not achieve any results, and, despite the opposition of the Soviet representative, the issue was returned to the Disarmament Subcommittee for discussion. This way of kicking the ball back and forth fully reflects the Western countries' continued adoption of delaying tactics on the issue of disarmament. However, the retreat of evading the issue of disarmament is getting narrower and narrower. The people of all countries demand that the stalemate on the issue of disarmament be broken without delay, and the strong will of the people will eventually force the "Cold War" forces to make concessions, so that the urgent issue of disarmament can make progress.

### 是打开裁军问题僵局的时候了

    是打开裁军问题僵局的时候了
    苏联最高苏维埃第四届第五次会议通过了就裁军问题致其他国家议会的呼吁书，并就日本国会关于禁止核子武器和停止核子武器试验的呼吁书发表了声明。会议还批准了苏联外交部长谢皮洛夫建议由苏、美、英三国迅速就立即停止一切原子武器和热核子武器试验缔结协定的发言。这些庄严的和平文件，毫无疑问地将在各国议会和全世界爱好和平的善良的人民中引起深刻的反响。
    苏联为争取裁减军备和禁止核子武器曾作了不懈的努力。在刚刚结束的联合国裁军委员会纽约会议上，苏联代表葛罗米柯又提出了裁减军备、禁止核子武器、停止核子武器试验和在这以前各国保证不使用这种武器的新建议。这个建议得到了南斯拉夫和印度的支持。南斯拉夫和印度在会上也提出了逐步裁减军备和停止核子武器试验的建议。这些建议又一次为打破裁军问题的僵局提供了可能性。
    可是，苏、南、印三国对裁军问题所提出的建设性倡议，没有得到西方国家相应的反应。在这次裁军委员会上，西方国家一上场就忙于歪曲十年裁军谈判不能达成协议的原因，一心想把责任推到苏联身上。同时，它们又提出了一个只能使裁军问题更加复杂化的原则性建议，来堵塞会议寻求任何有益的实际进展。
    同以美国为首的西方国家这种实际上阻挠达成协议的态度相反，苏联在这次会上又采取了寻求协议的新的实际步骤，表示愿意接受美国在联合国裁军小组委员会伦敦会议上提出的武装部队水平的建议。大家知道，这是苏联第二次接受西方国家提出的裁军数字了。当苏联在去年接受西方国家上一次提出的数字时，西方国家却抛弃了自己的建议，然而又提出了一个比上次建议高得多的水平。
    苏联采取的这个力谋打破裁军问题僵局的新行动，博得了世界各国广大舆论的热烈反应，甚至西方国家也不能否认苏联这一新努力的事实。英国代表纳丁承认，苏联的上述建议有“令人鼓舞的因素”。美国总统裁军问题顾问史塔生也说，这是走向苏联和西方裁军态度的和解的适度的一步。事情既然如此，西方国家已没有任何理由不采取相应的实际行动，从而在双方已经一致的地方迅速取得第一步的协议，以利于进一步达成全面的裁军协议。正如法国“解放报”所指出：“公众不会同意这种情况：当已经提出的建议可以实现的时候，又放弃它。”然而，种种迹象却表明西方国家又在制造新的遁词了。
    据西方国家通讯社的报道，苏联又一次同意西方提出的武装部队水平，使得西方国家感到“吃惊”。如果是真心为了求得协议而提出来的建议，在对方表示同意时应当表示欢迎，怎么可能会感到吃惊呢？西方通讯社的报道还说，由于苏联作了这一让步，西方将需要修改它们的建议。这就使人有理由怀疑，西方国家提出裁减武装部队到一致协议的水平的所谓具体方案，不过是用来搪塞舆论的玩意儿。事实给这种怀疑提供了有力的基础。西方国家的代表们已经转移到新的阵地上，来打它们这场不得人心的后卫战了。
    西方国家代表现在说：苏联同意的西方国家提出的武装部队水平，只有在同时采取停止扩充原子武器措施的情况下才能为西方接受。本来是西方国家，因为反对苏联的禁止原子武器的建议，提出裁减常规军备的主张来作为挡箭牌，现在他们又翻转过来。姑不论这是怎样陈旧的遁词，就在禁止原子武器的问题上，西方国家目前的立足点也是非常不妙的。苏联在新建议中，正是同时再次提出无条件禁止、销毁和停止制造原子武器和氢武器的建议。苏联最高苏维埃通过的决定，正式肯定了苏联政府关于禁止核子武器的这种立场。但是西方国家却仍旧坚决反对苏联的这个建议，硬说这是“骗局”。西方国家这种说东指西，说西指东的做法，不外是想替它们规避协议的策略找到一个不体面的掩蔽物。
    西方国家的这种僵硬态度，已经到了这样的地步，它们甚至对停止核子武器试验的建议，也断然加以拒绝。正如印度驻联合国代表梅农所指出的，全世界都对核子武器试验表示不安，停止这种试验，“将是走向裁军的第一个步骤”。但是，美国代表华兹沃斯硬说这种试验对于他们的“安全”是“至为必要的”。西方国家为了掩饰自己，提出了“限制”核子武器试验的建议，然而，梅农说得好，“任何限制仍旧保留毁灭的力量。”而且，就是这样的“限制”建议，也还要放在较后的裁军阶段实行。而首先要建立包括“空中视察”的监督制度并解决国际重大的政治问题。这就使得这个建议实际上变成纸上空谈。由此可见，西方国家是多么害怕在停止核子军备竞赛方面取得任何实际的进展。
    但是，西方国家这种态度，只能使它们自己处于更加不利的地位。目前国际紧张局势正在继续趋向缓和，“冷战”和军备竞赛政策日益不得人心。美国想用侈谈裁军和和平来掩盖它阻挠解决裁军问题的诡计，是骗不了人的。人们要求美国用实际行动来证明它的诚意。许多追随美国扩军备战而遭到经济困难的国家，包括英法在内，已表示要裁减军备，节省军费消耗，促进东西方关系，这是符合这些国家和世界和平的利益的。人们要求它们言行一致，在促使裁军问题的进展方面采取有益的步骤。
    由于西方国家的缺乏诚意，这次裁军委员会的纽约会议又没有取得结果，而且不顾苏联代表的反对，把问题重新交给裁军小组委员会去讨论。这种把皮球踢来踢去的办法，充分反映出了西方国家在裁军问题上继续采取拖延战术。但是，在裁军问题上一味遁逃的退路，是越来越窄了。各国人民要求毫不拖延地打开裁军问题的僵局，人民的强大意志将终于迫使“冷战”势力作出让步，使迫切的裁军问题能够得到进展。
