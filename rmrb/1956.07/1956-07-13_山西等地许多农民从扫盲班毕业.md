Yixing County in Jiangsu Province made 25,000 people literate, exceeding the total number of literacy graduates in all previous years after liberation. Among the students who have shaken off illiteracy, there are a certain number of township and commune cadres, Party members, and League members. According to statistics from Jieyu, Luan, and Shenchi counties in Shanxi, among the 16,053 graduates, there were 1,281 main township and commune cadres, 1,190 Party members, and 1,470 League members, accounting for 24.5% of the total graduates.

Most of the more than 3,000 graduates in Changle County, Fujian, will be promoted to spare-time elementary school classes.
