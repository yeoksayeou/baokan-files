    Emphasize the Publication of Foreign Classical Academic Works

    Editor:

    The current translation and publication of foreign classical academic works is not satisfactory. The works of the great forerunners of Marxist philosophy, Hegel, Feuerbach, etc., have not been available in bookstores across the country for many years. We can buy Lenin's "Abstract of Hegel's 'Science of Logic'" and "Abstract of Hegel's 'Lectures on the History of Philosophy,'" but we cannot buy Hegel's "Science of Logic" and "Lectures on the History of Philosophy." At the end of the year before last, He Lin's translation of "Hegel's Lesser Logic" was published by Sanlian Bookstore, but so far, no other Chinese translations of Hegel's works have appeared. The situation with Feuerbach's works is not much better. In recent years, in addition to Wang Taiqing's translation of "The Essence of Christianity" published by People's Publishing House in 1953, and Hong Qian's translation of "Principles of the Philosophy of the Future" published by Sanlian Bookstore in 1955, there have been no others. In addition, we cannot find Russian or German versions of Hegel's or Feuerbach's works in foreign language bookstores.

    Is it that we don't need to read the works of the forerunners of Marxist philosophy at all? Absolutely not. The classic Marxist-Leninist writers have always paid great attention to the great academic heritage of the past. Lenin repeatedly emphasized in many works that historical heritage should be deeply studied. Even in the tense and busy years of revolutionary struggle, he himself read widely and carefully studied classical philosophical works. His profound research on the forerunners of Marxist philosophy, especially Hegel's philosophical works, is our model.

    I suggest that the leading organs of publishing work should pay attention to the translation and publication of classical philosophical works, make an overall plan to meet our needs. Although the sales of such books are not as good as political pamphlets, they are very much needed by the academic and cultural circles. Doing a good job in the translation and publication of such books will greatly promote the improvement of our country's academic and cultural level, help intellectuals march towards science, and implement the policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend."

    Editor's Note

    After receiving Comrade Yang Xiaozhou's comments, we consulted with He Lin and Wang Taiqing, two translators of classical philosophical works, to understand the relevant situation. They also agreed that national publishing houses do not pay enough attention to the publication of classical academic works, and they especially felt that the backlog of manuscripts at the People's Publishing House (including Sanlian Bookstore) was too serious. A manuscript is delayed for more than a year, whether it is hundreds of thousands of words or thirty to fifty thousand words. For example, the first volume of the translation of Hegel's "History of Philosophy" was submitted to the publishing house as early as June 1954, but it has only just met the readers now. The second volume of Hegel's "History of Philosophy" was submitted in October 1955, and it is said that it will not be published until 1957. The manuscript of "Man a Machine" by La Mettrie translated by Gu Shouguan, with only forty to fifty thousand words, was submitted last July and has not been published yet. The "Selected Works of Diderot" (about 200,000 words), co-translated by Jiang Tianji, Chen Xiuzhai, and others, was submitted before June of last year, and has not yet been published.

    They believe that the reason for this phenomenon is that the editorial department of the People's Publishing House does not pay attention to the publication of academic works, and secondly, the work lacks planning. For them, publishing contracts are just empty words with no binding force. At the same time, there are also problems with their work style and methods. They often nitpick in small places, delaying publication time. For example, in the places where Marx and Engels' works are cited, they require the translator to directly copy the translation of the Moscow Foreign Languages Publishing House, saying that this is for "uniformity," but the translation of the "Foreign Languages Bureau" is not always correct. Some Russian translations are not good to begin with, and when translated into Chinese, there are even more mistakes. The translators had many disputes with the publishing house over this matter, which delayed a lot of time.

    The People's Publishing House's lack of attention to the publication of classical philosophical works is also reflected in the royalties for the translations. Currently, translating an ordinary English or Russian pamphlet earns a fee of nine yuan per thousand words, while translating classical works often requires reference to several versions and repeated review and deliberation by three or four comrades, word by word, but the royalty is only ten yuan per thousand words. The royalties for translations of classical works are too low, which is a very unreasonable phenomenon.

    Delaying publication time, on the one hand, prevents readers from seeing the books they crave, and on the other hand, it also affects the enthusiasm of translators. As soon as these translators have other work, they put aside the translation work. For example, the translation of Hegel's "History of Philosophy" has been interrupted several times, and the translation manuscripts of Descartes' works by Wang Taiqing, Spinoza's works by He Lin, Leibniz's works by Chen Xiuzhai, etc., have also been delayed.

    They believe that strengthening leadership, improving working methods, increasing contact with translators, and shortening the time to publish books are urgent problems to be solved. Only in this way can we promote work, increase the enthusiasm of translators, and meet the needs of readers. We believe that these opinions are correct and deserve the serious attention of publishing agencies.

### 重视外国古典学术著作的出版工作

    重视外国古典学术著作的出版工作
    编辑同志：
    当前外国古典学术著作的翻译出版工作，是不够令人满意的。马克思主义哲学的伟大先行者黑格尔、费尔巴哈等人的著作，多年来在全国各地书店里都买不到。我们可以买到列宁的“黑格尔‘逻辑学’一书的摘要”，“黑格尔‘哲学史讲义’一书的摘要”，但无法买到黑格尔的“逻辑学”和“哲学史讲义”。前年年底，贺麟译的“黑格尔小逻辑”一书由三联书店出版了，但直到现在还没有出现黑格尔的其他著作的中译本。关于费尔巴哈的著作，情况也没有好多少，这些年来，除了1953年人民出版社出版了王太庆译的“宗教的本质”，1955年三联书店出版了洪谦译的“未来的哲学原理”，再没有别的了。此外，我们到各处外文书店里去买黑格尔或费尔巴哈著作的俄文本或德文本，也不可得。
    是不是我们完全不必去读马克思主义哲学先行者的著作呢？决不是。马克思列宁主义经典作家历来十分注意过去的伟大学术遗产的。列宁在很多论著中一再强调应该深刻钻研历史遗产，他本人在那样紧张繁忙的革命斗争年代也还博览群籍，仔细研读了古典哲学著作，他对马克思主义哲学先行者，特别是对黑格尔哲学著作的深刻研究，正是我们的典范。
    我建议，出版工作的领导机关对哲学的古典著作的翻译出版工作，应该重视起来，作一通盘规划，以满足我们的需要。这种书籍，虽然销路比不上政治性的小册子，但它们是学术文化界十分需要的。做好这种书籍的翻译出版工作，对于提高我国学术文化水平、帮助知识分子向科学进军，以及对于实行“百家争鸣”的方针，都会起很大的推进作用。

    编者的话
    我们收到杨效周同志的意见后，曾向古典哲学著作的翻译工作者贺麟、王太庆两先生了解有关情况。他们对于国家出版社不重视古典学术著作的出版工作也有同感，特别感到人民出版社（包括三联书店）积压稿件的现象太严重了。一部稿子，一拖就是一年以上，几十万字的是如此，三、五万字的也是如此。如黑格尔“哲学史”第一卷译稿，早在1954年6月就交给出版社，但直到现在才和读者见面。黑格尔“哲学史”第二卷，1955年10月已交出译稿，据说要到1957年才能出版。顾寿观译的拉梅特里著“人是机器”一稿，仅四、五万字，去年七月交稿，至今尚未出版。江天骥、陈修斋等合译的“狄德罗选集”（约二十万字），去年六月以前即已交稿，现在也还没有出版。
    他们认为产生这种现象的原因是人民出版社编辑部不重视学术著作的出版工作，其次是工作缺乏计划性。对于他们，出版合同只是具文，没有约束力量。同时，他们的工作作风和方法上也有问题，往往在细小的地方吹毛求疵，拖延出版时间。举个例说，在引证马克思恩格斯著作的地方，他们要求译者直抄莫斯科外国文出版局的译文，据说这是为了“统一”，但是“外文局”的译文并不都是正确的。有的俄文译文本来不佳，转译成中文，错的更多。译者为了这事，和出版社发生过不少争执，耽误了不少时间。
    人民出版社不重视古典哲学著作的出版工作，还表现在对译稿的稿酬上。现在是译一本普通的英文或俄文小册子，稿费每千字九元，而译古典著作，往往须参考几种版本，经过三四位同志的一再校阅，逐字逐句的斟酌和推敲，稿酬每千字却只有十元。古典著作译文的稿费太低了，这是很不合理的现象。
    拖延出版时间，一方面使读者渴望的书不能和读者早日见面，另一方面也影响了翻译工作者的积极性，所有这些译者一有其他工作就把翻译工作抛开，如黑格尔“哲学史”的翻译工作曾几次中断，如王太庆的笛卡儿著作译稿，贺麟的斯宾诺莎著作的译稿，陈修斋的莱布尼兹著作的译稿等等，也延搁起来。
    他们认为加强领导，改进工作方法，增加和译著者的联系，缩短出书时间，是目前急待解决的问题。只有这样，才能推动工作，增进译著者的积极性，满足读者的需求。我们觉得这些意见是正确的，是值得出版机关严重注意的。
