Xinhua News Agency, July 30th - In the past two months, the Ministry of Higher Education has convened a series of meetings, and also invited presidents, deans, professors from some universities in Beijing, and some university graduates who have been working for about a year to hold symposiums to discuss several major issues existing in the current teaching reform in universities.

    Among these discussions, the first issue involved is how to better learn from the Soviet Union to carry out teaching reform. The reason for raising this question is that the phenomenon of excessive burden on students in universities in recent years has not been completely resolved, and the cultivation of students' independent thinking and independent working abilities is still poor. Higher education still has shortcomings in implementing the experience of learning from the Soviet Union, and there are tendencies of dogmatism and formalism, such as the current unified teaching plans and unified teaching syllabuses used in universities, textbooks, and teaching methods, which are not sufficiently integrated with China's actual situation. They pointed out that in recent years, in order to meet the country's needs for senior construction talents, higher education has developed significantly. However, the foundation of higher education and secondary education left over from old China is very weak. Although it has undergone adjustment and reform, the conditions in various aspects are still far behind those of the Soviet Union. In particular, in recent years, many new teachers have been added, and the quality of new students entering universities is not high enough, and teaching equipment is insufficient. Therefore, excessively emphasizing "unification" for each school with different conditions and demanding too much will inevitably lead to an excessive learning burden for students, affecting their ability to consolidate their knowledge and engage in independent research and thinking. For example, the new engineering teaching plan, which is basically based on the Soviet teaching plan, has a heavy workload, many courses, and little time for self-study, so that students cannot fully engage in independent thinking and research. In many teaching plans, the number of hours for specialized and specialized courses is too high, while the number of hours for basic courses and basic technical courses is relatively small, which cannot enable students to lay a theoretical knowledge foundation with sufficient depth and breadth.

    During the discussion, some people advocated that current university students should mainly learn basic courses well. With a solid foundation, professional knowledge will also improve faster in the workplace. Some people believe that the proportion of basic courses and professional courses should vary depending on the major, and some majors should mainly streamline the types of courses and study more specifically. However, many opinions advocate reducing the total number of class hours and removing courses in the current teaching plan that are not closely related to the major.

    Some people reflected that many teaching methods also have shortcomings. Oral exams are originally a good way to test students' understanding, but currently, universities have more students in each class than in the Soviet Union, and successive oral exams cause excessive tension and fatigue for teachers and students. Some people believe that not every course must have an oral exam, and it is better to use written exams for some courses that test calculation skills. Others pointed out that the current oral exams do not test students' understanding but excessively pursue some trivial details, which is also the reason for the excessive burden on teachers and students.

    During the discussion, many people pointed out that the policy of learning from the Soviet Union is unwavering. The problem lies in how to better understand the spiritual essence of Soviet experience and creatively apply it to China's actual situation. While learning from the Soviet Union, we should also study and absorb certain desirable aspects of capitalist countries and the old Chinese higher education system and should not negate everything. Some people suggested that the old Chinese higher education system had elective courses. If the number of courses is reduced in the teaching plan, elective courses could also be considered. These elective courses can enable some students with good academic performance to select certain courses under the guidance of teachers in addition to compulsory courses. General students can also graduate after completing the compulsory courses.

    Some people doubt whether higher education, which aims to cultivate specialized talents, is suitable for implementing the "all-round development" education policy in universities. The more positive opinion in the discussion is that the all-round development policy is correct for higher education, which aims to cultivate senior construction talents with both moral integrity and ability, and good health. However, they believe that all-round development does not equal average development. All-round development education and teaching students according to their aptitude, cultivating students' independent thinking and working abilities, and developing students' specialties are not contradictory but combined. Many people at the meeting criticized the "advanced collective" system and the mechanical pursuit of all "five" points for top students, which are more common in some universities, resulting in a one-sided understanding of the requirement of all-round development as average development, seriously restricting the rational development of students' personal specialties and interests, and hindering the cultivation of students' independent thinking and working abilities. For example, the "advanced collective" system, because it emphasizes the advancement of the collective, requires each student to be like an excellent student in everything; all activities advance at the same pace, so students' social activities must be arranged uniformly, and self-study time and content must be arranged uniformly. This aggravates the disadvantage of students' mechanical and rigid daily life. In the method of rewarding top students, it is also inappropriate to require first-class top students to have all "five" points; some schools also force students to reach certain exercise standards in "Labor and Defense System" training, regardless of their physical conditions.

    The meeting also discussed whether to implement the "Hundred Schools of Thought Contend" policy in the teaching reform of universities. Many people believe that such contention is possible, not only before the formulation of the teaching syllabus but also during teaching, other theories can be introduced or one's own opinions can be put forward. The discussion raised the issue of offering courses on idealism. Everyone believes that the purpose of studying such courses is to expand knowledge, deepen the understanding of idealism, and more forcefully criticize idealism. Therefore, there must be certain conditions for offering such courses, mainly teacher qualifications. Some people believe that it is better to offer such courses in senior grades, which can inspire students' independent thinking and the ability to criticize wrong theories.

### 高等教育部近两个月来召开一系列会议  讨论高等学校教学改革问题

    高等教育部近两个月来召开一系列会议
    讨论高等学校教学改革问题
    新华社30日讯　近两个月来，高等教育部召开了一系列会议，同时还邀请北京的一些高等学校校长、院长、教授和部分参加工作一年左右的高等学校毕业生举行座谈会，讨论当前高等学校教学改革中存在的若干重大问题。
    在这些讨论中，首先涉及到的是如何更好地学习苏联来进行教学改革的问题。这个问题的提出，是由于考虑到近年来高等学校中学生负担过重的现象仍然没有彻底解决，学生的独立思考和独立工作能力的培养还很差。高等教育在贯彻学习苏联经验方面还有缺点，存在着教条主义和形式主义的倾向，如目前高等学校所用的统一教学计划、统一教学大纲，教材和教学法等，结合中国的实际情况不够。他们指出，这几年来，为了适应国家对高级建设人才的需要，高等学校有了大量的发展，但是旧中国遗留下来的高等教育和中等教育的基础十分薄弱，虽然经过调整和改革，各方面的条件和苏联的相比还差得太远，特别是这几年来新师资增加多，高等学校新生入学的质量还不够高，教学设备不足等，所以对于每个条件不同的学校过分强调“统一”，要求偏高，必然产生学生学习负担过重，影响学生巩固地掌握所学知识和独立钻研思考的偏向。例如，基本上以苏联教学计划为蓝本的新的工科教学计划，就由于分量重，课程门数多，自学时间少，使学生不能充分进行独立思考和钻研；不少教学计划中专业、专门化课程时数偏多，而相对来说，基础课和基础技术课时数较少，不能使学生打下有足够深度、广度的理论知识的基础。
    讨论中，有人主张目前高等学校的学生，主要应学好基础课程，有了扎实的基础，到工作岗位上专业知识也会提高得比较快。也有人认为，基础课和专业课的比重如何，要区别是什么专业，有的专业主要是精简课程门类，学得专些。不过，很多意见都主张减少总学时数，把现行教学计划中和专业关联不密切的课程去掉。
    有的反映，不少教学方式也有缺点，口试本来是测验学生理解程度一种好的方式，但是目前高等学校每班学生比苏联多，依次口试造成教师和学生过度的紧张、疲劳。有的认为，不一定门门课程都必须口试，有些测验运算的课程采用笔试更好。还有的指出，目前在进行口试中，不是测验学生的理解程度，而过多地追问一些细微末节，这也是造成师生负担过重的原因。
    讨论中，很多人指出，学习苏联的方针是坚定不移的。问题在于如何更好地体会苏联经验的精神实质，针对中国实际来创造性地运用。在学习苏联的同时，还应该研究和吸取资本主义国家和我国旧高等教育制度中某些可取的地方，不应该一概否定。有人提出，旧中国高等教育制度中有选修课程，如果在教学计划中减少课程门类以后，也可以考虑增设选修课。这种选修课程可以使一些学习成绩好的学生在必修课程以外，由教师指导选修某些课程。对于一般的学生，在学完必修课程后同样可以毕业。
    有人怀疑，高等教育是培养专门人才，在高等学校贯彻“全面发展”的教育方针是否适合？在讨论中比较肯定的意见认为，全面发展的方针对于以培养德才兼备、身体健康的高级建设人才为宗旨的高等教育来说是正确的。但是，他们认为全面发展不等于平均发展，全面发展的教育和因才施教，培养学生的独立思考和工作能力，发展学生的特长不是矛盾而是相结合的。不少人在会上批判了目前某些高等学校中推行流弊较多的评选“先进集体”制度和机械争取门门“五”分的优等生制度等，以致把全面发展的要求片面地理解为平均发展，严重地限制了学生个人特长和兴趣爱好的合理发展，妨碍了培养学生的独立思考和工作能力。如评选“先进集体”制度，由于强调集体先进，就要求每个学生样样向优秀生看齐；一切活动齐头并进，因而对学生的社会活动要统一安排，自学时间和内容要统一安排。这就加重了学生作息生活机械刻板的缺点。在奖励优等生办法中，要求甲级优等生必须是全“五”分也不够适当；有些学校在“劳卫制”锻炼中，也不顾体质条件，强求达到一定的锻炼标准等，都是应该考虑的。
    会议对于在高等学校教学改革中应否贯彻“百家争鸣”的方针也作了讨论。许多人认为这种争鸣是可以的，不仅在拟订教学大纲以前可以争鸣，而且在施教时，也可以介绍其他学说或提出自己的见解。讨论中提出关于开设唯心主义课程的问题。大家认为，研究这种课程的目的是为了扩大知识，加深对唯心主义的认识以及更有力地批判唯心主义。因此开设这种课程要有一定的条件，主要是师资条件。有的认为，在高年级开设这种课程比较好，可以启发学生独立思考和批判错误理论的能力。
