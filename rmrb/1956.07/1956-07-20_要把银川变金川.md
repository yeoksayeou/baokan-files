    Turning Yinchuan into Jinchuan (Golden River)
    By Our Correspondent Liu Bang
    In spring or winter, a newcomer to the Yinchuan Special District of Gansu Province is often bewildered by a peculiar sight: a layer of alkali frost blanketing the beaches and fields, mirroring the snow on the peaks of Helan Mountain. Legend has it that Yinchuan got its name from the silver-white appearance of the ground, caused by the high salt and alkali content in the soil.
    Soil alkalization has become a major obstacle to the development of agricultural production in this area. For years, farmers have been hoping: when will these silver alkali flats be transformed into golden fields of wheat, with rippling rice paddies?
    Yinchuan is known as the "Jiangnan (South of the Yangtze River) of the Frontier." The terrain here is flat, the soil is fertile, and canals crisscross the land. The history of Yellow River irrigation can be traced back more than two thousand years, and farming has always been relatively developed. However, in the old society, these superior natural conditions did not bring happiness to the local working people. Ma Hongkui, the local warlord, ruled this area as a local emperor for eighteen years, demanding that local farmers provide labor, materials, and money every year to "repair the canals." But every year, the canal systems remained disorganized, the canals were dilapidated, the channels were blocked, and leaks and floods were frequent. On this point, Ma’s so-called "Construction Series" also described it this way: "The ditches meander and twist, overgrown with weeds." "Therefore, they only have the name of drainage ditches, but without the effect of drainage." The people of Yinchuan composed a song with grief and indignation: "Ningxia Plain, water irrigates the fields, planting and harvesting year after year, but still no food to eat. Don't blame the heavens!"
    At that time, the management rights of these ditches were completely controlled by landlords and local bullies, who used "free water." They irrigated whenever they wanted, as much as they wanted, even flooding the land to create lakes, inundating beaches and roads. Ordinary working farmers could only use "allocated water." Because water was hard to come by, once they got it, they would irrigate the crops deeply and heavily. Due to these factors, Yinchuan became dotted with lakes, causing the underground water level containing salt and alkali to rise. Through the capillary action of the soil and the evaporation of the surface soil, the salt and alkali components accumulated on the surface layer, turning many fertile fields into vast alkali flats and marshy wastelands. In the Yinchuan irrigation area (including part of the Wuzhong Autonomous Prefecture and Dengkou County in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region), there were more than six million mu of arable land, but by the eve of liberation, only 1.8 million mu could be cultivated. Among them, about one-third of the cultivated land was gradually salinizing to varying degrees, and yields were declining year by year.
    Since liberation, under the leadership of the Party and the People's Government, the people of Yinchuan have adopted two methods: "increasing the source" (digging drainage ditches to lower the groundwater level) and "conserving water" (implementing small-plot, shallow irrigation), and have been gradually overcoming the salt and alkali disasters imposed on them by the old society and nature!
    The turbid Yellow River water, carrying organic fertilizer, flows torrentially from south to north along the newly renovated, wide, and straight Tanglai Canal. Another 32-kilometer-long drainage ditch runs diagonally from southwest to northeast, passing under the Tanglai Canal through a culvert, discharging the grayish-green groundwater saturated with salt and alkali. This is the West River No. 2 Drainage Ditch, newly dug after liberation, which has transformed more than 700,000 mu of marshy alkali land into fertile fields. Around the ditch, there is an endless expanse of wheat fields. Anyone who does not know the past of this place would hardly imagine that just two years ago, this was a vast expanse of marsh and boundless alkali flats! In the past few years, the state has invested more than 5.5 million yuan here, and five state-owned farms, such as Lingwu and Balanghu, have been established on the newly reclaimed land. The cultivated area has increased from 1.8 million mu to 3.38 million mu.
    Due to the digging of drainage ditches, the groundwater level has generally dropped, and the land that is undergoing salinization is being improved. Coupled with the influence of other agricultural measures, crop yields have generally increased by more than double compared to the past. In 1952, the average yield of spring wheat here was 136 jin per mu, and in 1955 it had reached 280 jin.
    While leading the people of Yinchuan to dig ditches and drain water, the Party and the government advocated advanced irrigation techniques of economical water use and small-plot, shallow irrigation. Farmers were required to level the large, uneven fields and divide them into small, temporary irrigation plots of five or six fen each, arranged in a "non" (非) shape, according to the terrain and canal conditions, and to implement quantitative watering. After watering, the land was plowed again. In this way, the irrigation area can be increased, the damage of soil salinization can be reduced, and crop yields can be increased. However, such measures were a huge change for farmers who had always been accustomed to extensive cultivation and flood irrigation. When centralized water use was implemented in the canals, some people clamored: "The water is in the Yellow River, but we are not allowed to use it. Why?" An old woman in Ningshuo County held a child and walked to the canal management personnel, pointing to the gate and saying: "Will you release the water? If you don't, I'll jump into the canal with my child!" The canal administrator of Han Er Suo in Yongning County, seeing that the farmers were unwilling to implement small-plot, shallow irrigation, turned a blind eye and allowed the farmers to dig open the canal mouths.
    The Party organizations in the Yinchuan area did not waver because of this. They continuously and patiently educated cadres and the masses with vivid facts. Various counties universally carried out comparative experiments. The results of the spring wheat water consumption experiment conducted by the Yongning Wang Taibao Irrigation Experimental Station in 1954 showed that deep irrigation used 73.70 cubic meters more water per mu than shallow irrigation, but the yield was much lower. The results of the spring wheat water consumption experiment conducted by the Qianjin Agricultural Cooperative in Pingluo County in 1955 showed that furrow irrigation used 22.8 cubic meters less water than deep irrigation, and yielded 56 jin and 12 liang more grain per mu. Patient persuasion and vivid facts have educated the farmers. Now, on the basis of ensuring rational water use, the saying "use one less cubic meter of water and harvest one more jin of grain" has become the conclusion of the farmers themselves.
    This year, more than 300 agricultural cooperatives in the Yinchuan irrigation area have actively merged the densely webbed branch canals, bucket canals, and capillary canals, opened up old ridges, built small plot ridges, adjusted the planting area, planted the same crops together, and implemented small-plot, frequent irrigation, shallow irrigation, and unified planned water distribution. It is estimated that the area of small-plot, shallow irrigation this year can reach 50% to 70% of the sown area of dry crops.
    The transformation work is still continuing. Another giant drainage project in the Yinchuan irrigation area, the West River No. 4 Drainage Ditch, officially started on June 1. After the completion of this drainage project, the area of land where surface water is drained and the groundwater level is lowered will reach 344,000 mu. The degree of salinization of 250,000 mu of cultivated land can be greatly reduced, and more than 90,000 mu of lakes and barren beaches that cannot be cultivated due to alkalization will be turned into fertile fields.
    This year, the masses in the Yinchuan Special District have dug as many as 1,124 branch and capillary ditches themselves. The farmers of Ningshuo County, in addition to the spring repair project plan, are carrying out the construction of two branch canals of the West River No. 1 Drainage Ditch, and will excavate more than 600,000 cubic meters of soil.
    The struggle against salt and alkali disasters has become a conscious action of the masses. On the basis of agricultural cooperation, they will exert even greater strength to change their environment. It is entirely believable that in five or seven years, every inch of land in the Yinchuan area will be transformed into a fertile rice granary!

    要把银川变金川
    本报记者　柳梆
    春天或冬天，一个初到甘肃银川专区的人，往往会被这里的一种奇特的景象所迷惑——漫滩遍野的一层碱霜和贺兰山头的积雪，遥相辉映。相传，银川就是由于土壤含盐碱，地面经常呈现一片银白色而得名的。
    土壤的碱化已经成为这个地区农业生产发展的极大障碍。多少年来农民们都在盼望：什么时候才能把这些银色碱滩变成金色麦浪起伏的米粮川呢？
    银川素有“塞北江南”之称，这里地势平坦，土质肥沃，渠道纵横；引黄灌溉的历史，可以追溯到两千多年以上，农耕历来是比较发达的。但是在旧社会里，这样优越的自然条件并没有给当地的劳动人民带来幸福。马鸿逵在这个地方当了十八年的土皇帝，年年都要当地农民出工、出料、出钱“修渠”，但是年年都是那几条渠系紊乱、渠道破烂、渠身壅塞、时常渗漏和泛滥成灾的“盲肠”。关于这一点，在马匪的所谓“建设丛书”中也这样描写着：“沟身蜿蜒回曲，乱草丛生”。“故仅有退水沟之名，而无排水之效”。银川人民以悲愤的心情编了一支歌——“宁夏川，水浇田，年种年收无吃穿，不能怨老天！”
    当时这些沟渠，管理权完全操纵在地主恶霸的手里，他们用的是“自由水”，爱什么时候灌就什么时候灌，愿意灌多少就灌多少，甚至纵水成湖，漫滩淹路。而一般劳动农民只能淌“时运水”。正因为农民用水来得不易，一旦遇到有了水，就狠狠地往庄稼地里深灌。由于这几方面的原因，造成银川地区湖泊密布，使含盐碱的地下水位上升，经土壤的毛细管作用和表土蒸发作用，把盐碱成份聚积到土壤表层来，使许多良田沃土变成漫漫碱滩和沼泽荒地。银川这个灌溉区（包括吴忠自治州的一部分和内蒙古自治区的磴口县）共有可耕地面积六百多万亩，但是到了解放前夕，能够耕种的土地只有一百八十万亩；其中还有约三分之一以上的耕地在不同程度上逐渐盐碱化，产量逐年降低。
    解放以来，党和人民政府领导银川人民采取“开源”（挖排水沟降低地下水位）和“节流”（实行小畦浅灌）两个办法，已经把旧社会和自然界所加于银川人民的盐碱灾害，一步一步地战胜了！
    浑浊的、挟着有机肥质的黄河水，沿着新整修的、宽敞平直的唐徕渠，从南向北，汹涌而去。另一条三十二公里长的排水沟，从西南斜向东北，从唐徕渠的渠床底下穿涵洞而过，排泄着又灰又绿的饱含盐碱的地下积水。这就是解放后新挖的河西第二排水沟，它把七十多万亩沼泽碱地变成良田。在这渠沟的四周，是一眼望不尽的麦田。不了解这里的过去的人，谁会想得到两年以前这儿竟是一片汪洋的沼泽和茫茫碱滩呢？几年来国家在这里投资五百五十多万元，新涸出来的土地上建立了灵武、巴浪湖等五个国营农场。耕地面积已从180万亩增加到338万亩。
    由于挖了排水沟，地下水位普遍下降，正在盐碱化的耕地得到了改善。加上其他农业上的措施的影响，作物的产量一般都较过去提高一倍以上。1952年这里的春小麦平均每亩产量136斤，1955年已经达到280斤。
    党和政府在领导银川人民挖沟排水的同时，就提倡经济用水、小畦浅灌的先进灌溉技术。要求农民把大片高低不平的田地加以平整，按地形和渠道的情况，分成五、六分大的、排列成“非”字形的临时灌水小畦，实行定量浇水。浇完后再耕平。这样，就可以增加灌溉面积，减轻土壤盐碱灾害，提高作物产量。但是，这样的措施，对一向习惯于耕作粗放和大水漫灌的农民是一个巨大的改变。各渠实行集中用水的时候，有人就嚷：“水放在黄河里，不让我们淌，这是为什么？”宁朔县有个老太太抱着个小孩走到渠道管理人员面前，指着斗门说：“放水不？你不放，俺就连娃娃往渠里跳！”永宁县汉二所的渠道管理员，看到农民不愿意实行小畦浅灌，便一眼睁一眼闭地听任农民把渠口扒开。
    银川地区的党组织没有因此而动摇，他们不断地、耐心地用生动的事实来教育干部和群众。各县普遍展开对比试验。1954年永宁王泰堡灌溉试验站对春小麦用水量试验的结果是：深灌较浅灌每亩多用水73.70公方，产量反而低了很多。1955年平罗县前进农业社春小麦用水试验的结果是：畦灌比深灌少用水22.8公方，每亩多打56斤12两粮食。耐心的说服和活生生的事实教育了农民，现在，在保证合理用水的基础上，“少用一方水，多收一斤粮”的说法，已经成为农民群众自己的结论了。
    今年，银川灌区内三百多个农业社已经积极合并密如蛛网的支渠、斗渠和毛渠，打通老埂，修筑小畦埂，并调整播种面积，把同类作物播种在一起，实行小畦勤灌、浅灌和统一计划配水。估计今年的小畦浅灌面积可以达到旱作物播种面积的50％到70％。
    改造工作还在继续着，银川灌区内的另一个巨型排水工程——河西第四排水沟，在六月一日正式动工了。这个排水工程完成以后，排除地面水和降低地下水位的土地面积将达三十四万四千亩。有二十五万亩耕地的盐碱化程度可以大大降低，有九万多亩湖泊和因碱化而不能耕种的荒滩将要变成良田。
    今年，银川专区的群众自己开挖的支、毛沟多达1，124道。宁朔县的农民在春修工程计划以外，正在进行着河西第一排水沟的两条支干沟的工程，要挖出六十多万方土。
    和盐碱灾害展开斗争已经成为群众自觉的行动，在农业合作化的基础上，他们将发挥更加巨大的力量来改变自己的环境。完全可以相信：五年或七年以后，银川地区的寸土尺地都会变成富饶的米粮川！
