Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, 25th. Gansu Province's Wudu Special District is vigorously constructing water conservancy projects, seeking to change the situation where mountainous and plain areas cannot both achieve comprehensive harvests.

More than 90% of Wudu Special District is mountainous, with altitudes ranging from 1,000 to 3,000 meters. However, being close to Sichuan, the climate is generally milder than in other parts of Gansu, with abundant rainfall, and the water sources on the high mountains are more plentiful than on the hillsides and below. Temperatures on the mountains are relatively low, so heavy rainfall easily leads to waterlogging, making it difficult for crops to mature. On the other hand, harvests are more reliable during droughts. In contrast, farmland in the plain areas below the mountains is susceptible to drought. Locally, there's a saying, "Drought favors the mountains, floods favor the plains."

This year, the Party and government leadership of Wudu Special District, in order to change this natural situation and strive for comprehensive harvests in both mountainous and plain areas, based on the local natural characteristics and the experience of the peasants, proposed a plan to build water and soil conservation projects such as mountain ponds and dams on the mountains to store excess water from the mountaintops, avoiding waterlogging and irrigating farmland on the hillsides; to build terraced fields and level land on the hillsides to facilitate irrigation; and to build dikes in the river valleys and plains below the mountains, combining flood control with the opening of canals to irrigate fields. This plan has already begun to be implemented this year. In the first half of the year, the channels, dikes, reservoirs, ponds, and other projects built throughout the special district can expand the irrigated area by 800,000 mu.

Based on the current summer harvest and autumn crop growth, it is estimated that this year's grain production in Wudu Special District will increase by more than double compared to last year.

Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, 25th. The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has begun surveying and planning the medium and small rivers throughout the region. The survey and planning of medium and small rivers is part of the overall plan to control and develop the Yellow River and the Liao River. This year's survey and planning include twelve rivers such as the Dahei River on the Tumochuan Plain on the southern foot of the Daqing Mountains, a major grain and economic crop producing area, the Kundulun River near Baotou on the southern foot of the Ura Mountains, and the Ulshun River and Kherlen River on the Hulunbuir Grassland.

The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has a relatively dry climate, but its water resources are very rich. The region has seventy-eight rivers with a length of over forty kilometers, with a drainage area of more than 648,000 square kilometers. The Water Conservancy Department, based on water volume and terrain conditions, preliminarily estimates that after these rivers are controlled and developed, the irrigated area can reach 39 million mu, which is four and a half times the existing irrigated area.

### 甘肃武都专区大力兴修水利工程  争取山区和川区全面丰收  内蒙古开始勘测规划全区中小河流

    甘肃武都专区大力兴修水利工程
    争取山区和川区全面丰收
    内蒙古开始勘测规划全区中小河流
    新华社兰州25日电　甘肃省武都专区正在大修水利工程，设法改变山区、川区不能全面得到丰收的情况。
    武都专区90％以上是山地，海拔在一千公尺至三千公尺之间，但地近四川，气候一般比甘肃其他地区温和，雨量充足，而且山高水高，山顶上的水源倒比山腰和山下面多。山上气温较低。因此下雨多容易成涝，庄稼不易成熟；天旱时收成反而有把握。山下川区农田却容易受旱。当地有“天旱收山，雨涝收川”的说法。
    今年武都专区党、政领导机关为了改变这种自然情况，争取山区川区全面丰收，根据当地的自然特点和农民的经验，提出了在山上兴修山湾塘堰等水土保持工程，把山顶上多余的水蓄积起来，避免水涝，并浇灌半山农田；在半山兴修梯田、平整土地，使之便于灌溉；以及在山下河谷平川地区兴修堤坝，结合防洪，开渠灌溉田地的计划。这个计划今年已经开始实现。上半年全专区已经兴修的渠道、堤坝、蓄水池、塘堰等工程共可扩大灌溉面积八十万亩。
    据目前夏收和秋田生长的情况，今年武都专区的粮食产量预计可比去年增产一倍多。
    据新华社呼和浩特25日电　内蒙古自治区开始勘测规划全区的中、小河流。对中小河流的勘测规划，是配合根治和开发黄河、辽河总体规划的一部分。今年进行勘测规划的有主要粮食和经济作物产区大青山南麓土默川平原上的大黑河、乌拉山南麓包头附近的昆都仑河和呼伦贝尔草原上的乌尔顺河、克鲁伦河等十二条。
    内蒙古自治区气候比较干燥，但水利资源是很丰富的。全区有长达四十公里的河流七十八条，流域面积六十四万八千多平方公里，水利厅根据水量和地形条件初步估算，在这些河流经过治理开发后，灌溉面积可达三千九百万亩，为现有灌溉面积的四倍半。
