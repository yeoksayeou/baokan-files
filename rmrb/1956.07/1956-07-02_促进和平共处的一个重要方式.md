An immense torrent of peace is advancing mightily.

The idea of peaceful coexistence is spreading everywhere with this torrent, gradually becoming deeply rooted in people's hearts.

The profound scientific conclusion drawn from the current international situation that "war is not inevitably unavoidable" further stirs the world's people's confidence in a bright and beautiful tomorrow, encouraging their fighting spirit to strive for and defend peace.

This powerful torrent of peace is melting the "Cold War," gradually easing international tensions, and making the prospect of lasting peace increasingly bright.

This is the overall picture presented by the international situation in recent years.

In this picture, mutual visits and contacts between leaders of countries with different systems occupy a very important position.

The end of the Korean War reversed the international situation for the first time after World War II, opening up the road to international peace and security. The 1954 Geneva Conference, based on the achievements of the Indochinese people's struggle for freedom, resulted in the leaders of the countries concerned negotiating an end to the eight-year-long Indochina War, thereby further consolidating peace in the East.

At that time, Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai visited India and Burma, and held talks with Indian Prime Minister Nehru and Burmese former Prime Minister U Nu successively. Through these talks, the friendly relations between China and its neighbors India and Burma were greatly developed. At the same time, the famous Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence were announced as the criteria for guiding relations between countries. The world's peaceful areas expanded.

The gathering of leaders from 29 Asian and African countries in Bandung in 1955 created the Bandung Spirit, characterized by safeguarding peace, opposing colonialism, and promoting friendly cooperation among Asian and African countries. This conference was the first grand gathering of leaders from Asian and African countries, marking a new era in which the people of Asia and Africa independently stepped onto the world historical stage. Due to the contacts at this conference and the meeting between Premier Zhou Enlai and Indonesian government leaders during the conference, China developed friendly relations with many Asian and African countries.

The Bandung Spirit was later significantly developed through the visits to China by Indian Prime Minister Nehru, Burmese former Prime Minister U Nu, Indonesian Prime Minister Ali Sastroamidjojo, and Cambodian Prince Sihanouk. These contacts and the successive visits by leaders of India, Burma, and other countries to the Soviet Union, enhanced mutual understanding between Asian and African countries and socialist countries, dispelled certain doubts that had hindered mutual rapprochement, and greatly promoted friendly understanding and mutual support, which greatly contributed to the stability of the international situation.

1955 marked the resumption of direct contact between the heads of the world's major powers. The Geneva Conference of the heads of government of the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France reduced the "Cold War" atmosphere created by the North Atlantic policy since the end of the war and created the Geneva spirit that later permeated the world. As British Prime Minister Eden said, the 1955 Geneva Conference began the work that the major powers should have begun in 1944. The major achievement of the Geneva Conference was that the first contact between the heads of state after the war proved that it was possible to find common ground on the basic issue of preventing new wars and maintaining peace. The Geneva Conference also proved that the logic of aggressive military blocs appeared completely weak in the face of the development of real international life. The main achievement of the conference was that the major powers unanimously condemned the use of war as a means of resolving international disputes, thereby effectively recognizing the necessity of peaceful coexistence.

The Geneva spirit was significantly embodied in the visit of the leaders of the Federal Republic of Germany to the Soviet Union. While further developing friendly relations with the German Democratic Republic, the Soviet Union established diplomatic relations with the Federal Republic of Germany, which helped to resolve the German question on a peaceful and democratic basis, and helped to promote peace and security in Europe.

In the past few months, the leaders of the Nordic countries have successively visited the Soviet Union, enhancing mutual understanding and rapprochement, which is also very helpful to strengthen peace and security in Europe.

Last winter, the governments and people of India, Burma, and Afghanistan welcomed the visit of Soviet leaders with unparalleled enthusiasm. The Soviet people's sincere concern and support for the national liberation movements of the South Asian people, as well as the South Asian people's admiration for the socialist country of the Soviet Union, were powerfully expressed during this visit. This visit has had and will continue to have a profound impact on consolidating world peace and strengthening the national independence movement, and enhancing mutual support and cooperation in this regard.

Not long ago, Indian Vice President Radhakrishnan and the Crown Prince of Yemen visited the Soviet Union. Now, the King of Iran is visiting the Soviet Union, and the Soviet Foreign Minister has just concluded his beneficial visits to Egypt, Syria, and Lebanon. In addition, Sihanouk and the Indian Vice President visited Eastern European people's democratic countries. All of this is playing an important role in promoting peaceful coexistence between countries with different systems and strengthening friendly cooperation between socialist countries and Asian and African countries.

In establishing the norms of peaceful coexistence, special mention should be made of three important international activities that took place not long ago: the visit of Soviet leaders to Britain, the visit of French leaders to the Soviet Union, and the visit of Yugoslav leaders to France. In these visits and talks, socialist countries, together with Western capitalist powers such as Britain and France, declared the principle of peaceful coexistence as the guiding principle in relations between countries. This is a great victory for the idea of peaceful coexistence!

Now, it is clear to people how much leaders' contacts between countries with different social systems can contribute to the cause of world peace. From the achievements made by these contacts, people can now draw necessary conclusions.

Today, when socialism has appeared on the globe as a world system, capitalist powers, with the exception of a very small number of reactionary groups, have to accept the established fact of "coexistence" with the socialist world.

Socialist countries have always pursued a peaceful foreign policy; and on the side of capitalist countries, while the broad masses of people resolutely oppose war, even the ruling groups of Western powers now know that, under the current balance of power, provoking war is not necessarily beneficial to themselves. Therefore, peaceful negotiations are increasingly affirmed by more and more people as the only viable way to resolve international disputes.

After World War II, capitalist powers pursued a policy of "Cold War" and "strength," creating an atmosphere of tension in international relations, creating mutual suspicion and distrust. Relieving this suspicion and building mutual trust are very important for the development of international friendly cooperation. Personal contact between national leaders has proven to be a very effective way to relieve suspicion and build mutual trust. A frank exchange of views between national leaders, explaining their respective viewpoints, and seeking the greatest possible mutual understanding under the principle of seeking common ground while reserving differences, can reduce mutual distrust and help implement constructive policies in international relations.

The basic reason why countries with different systems can gradually seek mutual understanding in the current situation is that the people of these countries have common demands and aspirations in some basic issues, such as defending world peace, safeguarding national sovereignty and independence, and developing economic, cultural, scientific, and technological exchanges. These demands and aspirations have become an irresistible mainstream in current international life. Therefore, under the mainstream of socialist countries and world peace forces, the leaders of capitalist powers cannot but reflect, to some extent, the demands and aspirations of the people. Churchill's recent speech in Aachen, which put forward the slogan that "genuine European unity must have Russia's participation," is a typical example of this reflection.

It can be seen from this that the increase in contacts between national leaders is part of the general trend of the current international situation towards detente. With the growth of the possibility of peaceful settlement of international disputes and the development of international cooperation, the importance of contact between national leaders is also growing.

Here, two views are harmful.

Some naive people have too many illusions about contact between leaders of countries with different systems and are dissatisfied with the results of these contacts. For example, recently, among some well-intentioned people, there has been an underestimation of the results of the British-Soviet talks and the French-Soviet talks, believing that the talks did not solve any practical problems. These people ignore the deep divisions that have existed between the major powers for many years, and these divisions cannot be resolved overnight. They do not understand that through these talks, finding out where the real differences lie, exploring possible ways to resolve the differences, and, to a certain extent, restoring understanding and trust, creates good conditions for gradually resolving international disputes and promotes the situation in a direction that is conducive to peace.

Another view is to fundamentally deny the significance of contact. This actually conforms to the wishes of the enemies of peace. It must be fully recognized that certain monopoly capital groups in Western capitalist powers and certain political agents of these monopoly capital groups are full of hostility towards the idea of peaceful coexistence. Some influential figures in the US ruling group are like this. They launched a campaign to bury the Geneva spirit. They deliberately obliterated the important achievements of the British-Soviet and French-Soviet talks, and described these talks as "unhappy ending" without any results. In fact, this reflects the deep fear of a few reactionaries about the prospects for peace and international cooperation shown by these events. It can be asserted that the development of the logic of international life will leave these few reactionaries behind.

Socialist countries are willing to coexist peacefully with all countries, including the United States. We have made a series of efforts to strive to improve relations with the United States.

During the Bandung Conference last year, Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai stated that China did not want to fight with the United States but was willing to negotiate to resolve the dispute between the two countries in the Taiwan area. In the Geneva talks between the Chinese and American ambassadors, China has always advocated seeking ways, including holding a meeting of the Chinese and American foreign ministers, to peacefully resolve the disputes between the two countries. Premier Zhou Enlai once again expressed the Chinese people's desire to be friendly with the United States in his report to the National People's Congress on June 28.

Soviet government leader Bulganin also wrote to US President Eisenhower, proposing the conclusion of a US-Soviet Treaty of Friendship.

But until now, these peace initiatives have not received a positive response from the US government. As everyone knows, the American people love peace and support the idea of peaceful coexistence, and recently some more clear-headed figures in the US ruling group have also issued calls for adjusting US foreign policy based on the new developments in the international situation. The people of the world eagerly expect the US government to respond to the proposition of peaceful coexistence and international cooperation with practical actions, rather than empty statements.

Under the impact of the great torrent of world peace, the isolated islands of the "Cold War" will not be able to hold out in the end.

    促进和平共处的一个重要方式
    张放
    强大的和平巨流在浩浩荡荡地前进。
    和平共处的思想随着这条巨流在到处传播，逐渐地普遍深入人心。
    “战争不是注定不可避免的”这个从当前国际局势中得出的深刻的科学结论，更加激起世界人民对于晴朗而美丽的明天的信心，鼓舞着他们争取和保卫和平的斗志。
    这条强大的和平巨流正在使“冷战”消融，使国际紧张局势逐渐缓和，使持久和平的前景越来越明亮。
    这就是近年来国际局势中呈现出来的一幅总的图景。
    在这幅图景中，不同制度各国领导人员之间的相互访问和接触占有十分重要的地位。
    朝鲜战争的结束，在第二次世界大战后第一次扭转了国际局势，开辟了国际和平安全的道路。1954年的日内瓦会议，在印度支那人民为自由而斗争所获得的成就的基础之上，有关国家领导人员进行协商的结果，结束了流血八年之久的印度支那战争，从而进一步巩固了东方的和平。
    就在这个时候，我国总理周恩来访问印度、缅甸，同印度总理尼赫鲁和缅甸前总理吴努先后举行会谈，通过这些会谈，中国同印度、缅甸这些邻国的友好关系得到了很大的发展；同时，著名的和平共处五项原则被宣布为指导国家同国家的关系的准则。世界的和平地区扩大了。
    亚非二十九个国家的领导人员1955年在万隆的集会，创造了以保卫和平、反对殖民主义、亚非各国友好合作为特征的万隆精神。这次会议是亚非各国领导人员的首次盛会，它标志着亚非两大洲人民独立自主地登上世界历史舞台的新纪元。由于在这次会议上的接触和会议期间周恩来总理同印度尼西亚政府领导人员的会见，中国同许多的亚非国家发展了友好的关系。
    万隆精神后来由于印度总理尼赫鲁、缅甸前总理吴努、印度尼西亚总理阿里·沙斯特罗阿米佐约、柬埔寨亲王西哈努克的访问我国而得到了重大的发展。这些接触和印度、缅甸等国家领导人的先后访问苏联，增进了亚非国家同社会主义国家相互之间的了解，消释了曾经阻碍着相互接近的某些怀疑，从而大大促进了友好谅解和相互支持的关系，这就大大有助于国际局势的稳定。
    1955年标志着世界主要大国首脑之间直接接触的恢复。苏、美、英、法四大国政府首脑日内瓦会议减少了战后以来北大西洋政策所制造的“冷战”气氛，而创造了后来弥漫世界的日内瓦精神。正如英国首相艾登所说的，1955年的日内瓦会议开始了各大国应该在1944年开始的工作。日内瓦会议的重大成果在于，大国首脑战后第一次的接触就证明在防止新战争，维护和平这个基本问题上是可以找到共同的语言的。日内瓦会议还证明，侵略性军事集团的逻辑在现实国际生活的发展面前显得完全软弱无力。会议的主要成就就是大国一致谴责了以战争作为解决国际争端的手段，从而实际上承认了和平共处的必要性。
    日内瓦精神在德意志联邦共和国国家领导人访问苏联的事件中得到显著的体现。苏联在进一步发展同德意志民主共和国之间的友好的关系同时，同德意志联邦共和国建立了邦交，这个事实有助于德国问题在和平民主基础上的解决，有助于欧洲的和平安全。
    在过去几个月中间，北欧各国的领导人先后访问苏联，增进了相互的了解和接近，也极有助于加强欧洲的和平和安全。
    去年冬，印度、缅甸、阿富汗的政府和人民曾经以无比的热情欢迎苏联领导人的访问。苏联人民对于南亚人民民族解放运动的殷切的关怀和支持，以及南亚人民对于社会主义国家苏联的仰慕，都在这次访问中强有力地表达出来了。这次访问对于巩固世界和平和加强民族独立运动，增进在这方面的相互支持和合作，已经产生而且将要继续产生深运的影响。
    不久以前，印度副总统拉德哈克里希南和也门皇太子访问了苏联，现在，伊朗国王正在苏联进行访问，而苏联外长刚刚结束了他对埃及、叙利亚、黎巴嫩的有益的访问。此外，西哈努克和印度副总统到东欧人民民主国家作了访问，这一切都在促进不同制度国家和平共处，加强社会主义国家同亚非国家的友好合作关系方面起重要作用。
    在确立和平共处的准则方面，应该特别提到不久以前苏联领导人员访问英国，法国领导人员访问苏联，南斯拉夫领导人员访问法国等三次重要的国际活动，在这些访问和会谈中，社会主义国家同英、法等西方资本主义大国一起宣布了和平共处的原则为各国关系中的指导原则。这是和平共处思想的巨大胜利！
    现在，人们清楚地看得见，不同社会制度国家的领导人员之间的接触，对于世界和平事业可以做出多么重大的贡献。从这些接触所获得的成就中，人们现在可以得出必要的结论。
    当社会主义已经以世界体系而出现在地球上的今天，资本主义的大国，除了极少数的反动集团之外，不得不接受同社会主义世界“共处”这个既成的事实。
    社会主义国家一贯执行和平的外交政策；而在资本主义国家方面，广大人民固然坚决反对战争，就是西方大国的统治集团现在也知道，在当前的力量的对比条件下，挑起战争对他们自己来说是不见得有好处的。因此，和平谈判被愈来愈多的人作为解决国际争端唯一可取的方法而肯定下来。
    第二次大战以后，资本主义大国执行“冷战”和“实力”政策，在国际关系中制造了紧张气氛，制造了互相怀疑和互不信任。释除这种怀疑和建立相互的信任，对于发展国际友好合作是很重要的。国家领导人员之间的个人接触，证明对于释除怀疑和建立互信是一种极为有效的方式。国家领导人员之间坦率地交换意见，说明各自的观点，并且在求同存异的原则下尽可能求得最大可能的相互谅解，能够减少互不信任，有利于在国际关系中执行建设性的政策。
    不同制度的国家之间所以能在目前局势下逐步求得相互的谅解，基本原因在于这些国家的人民在一些基本问题方面，例如保卫世界和平，维护民族主权和独立，发展经济、文化、科学、技术的交流等等，具有共同的要求和愿望。这些要求和愿望已经成为当前国际生活中不可抗拒的主流。所以在社会主义国家和世界和平力量的主流之下，资本主义大国的领导人员也不能不在某种程度上反映若干人民的要求和愿望。丘吉尔最近在亚琛的演说提出“真正的欧洲统一必须有俄国参加”的口号，就是这种反映的一个典型的例子。
    由此可见，国家领导人员之间的接触的增加是目前整个国际局势趋向缓和的总趋势的一部分。随着和平解决国际争端和发展国际合作可能性的增长，国家领导人员之间接触的重要性也越来越大了。
    这里，有两种看法是有害的。
    有一些天真的人们对不同制度国家领导人员接触抱着过多的幻想，对这些接触所产生的结果不满意。例如，最近，在某些善意的人们中间，对于英苏会谈和法苏会谈的结果曾有一种过低的估计，认为会谈没有解决什么实际问题。这些人们忽视了大国之间存在着多年的深刻的分歧，这些分歧不是一夜之间就可以解决的。他们不懂得，经过这些会谈，找出真正的分歧所在，探寻解决分歧的可能途径，而且在一定程度上恢复谅解和信任，就为逐步解决国际争端创造了良好的条件，推动局势往有利于和平的方向前进。
    另外一种看法是根本否定接触的意义。这实际上符合于和平敌人的心意。必须充分估计到西方资本主义大国的某些垄断资本集团和这些垄断资本的某些政治代理人，对于和平共处的思想是满怀敌意的。美国统治集团中的一些有势力的人物便是这样。他们发起要埋葬日内瓦精神的运动。他们故意抹煞英苏和法苏会谈的重要成就，而把这些会谈说成是毫无结果的“不欢而散”。事实上，这正反映出少数反动派对于这些事件所展示出来的和平和国际合作远景的深刻的恐惧。可以断言，国际生活逻辑的发展将会把这些少数反动派抛在后面。
    社会主义国家是愿意同一切国家和平共处的，包括美国在内。在争取改善同美国的关系方面，我们已经做了一连串的努力。
    我国周恩来总理在去年万隆会议时期就声明我国不要同美国打仗而愿意谈判解决两国在台湾地区的争端。在中美两国大使日内瓦会谈中，我国一直主张寻求途径、包括举行中美外长会议来和平解决两国争端。周恩来总理六月二十八日在向全国人民代表大会报告中再一次表示了中国人民同美国友好的愿望。
    苏联政府领袖布尔加宁也曾经写信给美国总统艾森豪威尔，提议缔结美苏友好条约。
    但是一直到现在，这些和平倡议还没有得到美国政府方面的积极的反应。大家知道，美国人民是爱好和平和拥护和平共处的思想的，而最近美国统治集团中某些头脑比较清醒的人物也发出了根据国际局势的新发展调整美国外交政策的呼声。世界人民殷切地期待，美国政府能够用实际行动，而不是用空洞的声明，来响应和平共处和国际合作的主张。
    在世界和平的巨流的冲击之下，“冷战”的孤岛终究是保持不住的。
