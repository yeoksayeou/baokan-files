    Late at night on July 3rd, a train carrying four cars loaded with rice seedlings departed from Hefei Railway Station. This train carried the brotherly friendship of members of agricultural producers' cooperatives such as Jianghuai and Feinan in Feixi County to the members of agricultural cooperatives such as Jinxing in Jinzhuang Township, Huaiyuan County.

    This year, the mid-season crops of agricultural cooperatives such as Jinxing in Jinzhuang Township, Huaiyuan County, suffered reduced yields due to waterlogging. To ensure that 90% of the members increased their income, the General Branch of the Communist Party of China in Jinzhuang Township mobilized various cooperatives to expand the planting area of rice by 1,000 mu to compensate for the mid-season losses. Upon hearing that fraternal cooperatives in the waterlogged areas of northern Anhui lacked rice seedlings, members of agricultural cooperatives such as Jianghuai in Feixi County transported 100,000 jin of seedlings to Hefei Railway Station overnight on July 3rd.

    Workers at Hefei Railway Station tried their best to protect the life of the seedlings. Before loading, they sprayed the four cars with tap water to reduce the temperature of the cars and prevent the seedlings from being damaged by the heat. Upon learning that the seedlings were to support farmers in the waterlogged areas of northern Anhui, the Bengbu Branch of the Jinan Railway Administration specially moved the cars carrying the seedlings several hours earlier.

    On July 4th, this batch of seedlings had already been transported to Jinzhuang Township, Huaiyuan County. The ninth production team of Jinxing Agricultural Cooperative received seedlings for 36 mu of land that day and transplanted them all the next day.

    七月三日深夜，有一列火车挂着四节装满稻秧的车皮，开出了合肥火车站。这列火车，把肥西县江淮、肥南等农业生产合作社社员的兄弟友谊，带给了怀远县金庄乡金星等农业社的社员们。
    怀远县金庄乡金星等农业社今年午季作物受涝减产。为了保证90％的社员增加收入，中共金庄乡总支发动各个社扩大水稻种植面积一千亩，来弥补午季损失。肥西县江淮等农业社社员们听说淮北受涝地区的兄弟社缺乏稻秧，在七月三日，连夜把十万斤秧苗挑运到合肥火车站。
    合肥火车站的工人们想尽办法来保护秧苗的生命，装车前把四节车皮用自来水喷洒一遍，降低车皮的温度，以免秧苗受热损坏。济南铁路管理局蚌埠分局听说秧苗是支援淮北受涝地区农民的，特地提前几个小时把装运秧苗的车皮挂走。
    七月四日，这批秧苗已经运到了怀远县金庄乡。金星农业社第九生产队当天领到的三十六亩田的秧苗，第二天一天就栽好了。
