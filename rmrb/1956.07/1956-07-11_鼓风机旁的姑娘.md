Beside the enormous blower stands a young girl, Comrade Xie Jingyun, a twenty-one-year-old female driver. She walks constantly around the blower, listening here and looking there, touching it now and then. Her work appears to be relaxed and leisurely, but inside she is intensely focused. Her job requires a high degree of mental concentration. Her eyes watch nearly thirty instrument dials, and her ears listen to the internal sounds of the machine through headphones. She uses her sight and hearing to judge the operational status of each component. The machine must rotate according to her will; the young girl is the master of the large machine.

Before liberation, a girl growing up in the countryside never imagined she could work in a heavy industrial factory, let alone independently operate such a large machine. What she saw growing up were the older sisters and sisters-in-law in her village, marrying in and marrying out, revolving around the cooking stove. She vaguely wondered: would her future be the same as theirs? Because she was born into a poor peasant family, even her brother couldn't afford to go to school, so how could a "yellow-haired girl" get the chance? Back then, she held her younger sister every day. After her sister fell asleep, she would go to the fields to dig up some wild vegetables, bringing them back to mix with flour to eat. School was for other people.

The year of liberation, she was ten years old, and suddenly everything changed. The old people and the wives were dancing and singing, and she, along with many other young girls, hand in hand, ran and jumped into elementary school. From that day on, pencils shortened and disappeared in her hands one by one. Before she knew it, the last book of sixth grade was about to be finished.

The restoration and expansion of Anshan Iron and Steel brought her excitement and encouragement. From the newspaper advertisement columns, many factories and mines waved to her. So, with the encouragement of her teachers and the permission of her parents, she came to Anshan. At the club of the electrical repair factory, she submitted her test paper, scored first place, and became a worker.

The night Xie Jingyun left her mother and home, sleeping in the employee dormitory for the first time, she didn't close her eyes all night. She was too happy. She thought of the new comrades she had met during the day, all of them so kind, like brothers and sisters. She thought about what the comrade from the personnel department had told them, and felt even more that working at Anshan Iron and Steel was truly an honor! She was determined to learn her skills well and serve the country.

Xie Jingyun's initial days at the Anshan Iron and Steel Power Plant were spent learning. After completing a week of safety training, she began studying technical theory – "the principle and construction of turbine engines." The first difficulty she encountered in her studies was not understanding the drawings. A horizontal line, a vertical line, a square, a triangle – she didn't understand what these represented. She asked when she didn't understand. In class, she asked the teacher, who patiently explained to her, redrawing the pictures on the blackboard, enlarging them, and explaining them repeatedly until the knot between her eyebrows loosened. After class, she also studied with other classmates in the dormitory, or she would find a quiet place to think. In the short summer nights, when some classmates had already gone to sleep, she was still thinking and drawing, clapping her hands in excitement when she understood a formula or a principle. After overcoming the first difficulty, although she understood from the drawings, the theoretical knowledge could not be combined with the actual objects. A massive blower's entirety was encased in iron. Even if you walked next to it, all you saw were instruments, and its internal secrets were difficult to guess. Therefore, Xie Jingyun was troubled every day by trying to figure out the blower's secrets. In class, she and other classmates asked the teacher some naive questions: "Teacher, what does a vacuum look like?" The teacher spent a lot of effort, but it was difficult to find a complete answer; at the end of the explanation, he had to say: "A vacuum is invisible."

More than three months of technical theory study passed quickly, and Xie Jingyun was assigned to practice on the No. 21 machine. The shift leader here was Comrade Xiao Chunhua, a Communist Party member, who helped Xie Jingyun a lot. Not only did he patiently and repeatedly explain when Xie Jingyun asked, but he also asked her even when she didn't ask. When someone first came to the machine room, the deafening noise made it impossible to hear other people's voices. Master Xiao put his mouth close to her ear and shouted loudly, while also drawing pictures to explain. The young girl quickly became Master Xiao's favorite apprentice, and he liked her boldness, dexterity, diligence. It was a time when "production civilization" was being promoted, and Xie Jingyun cleaned the floor until it was shiny every day and wiped the machines until they were sparkling. Master Xiao was a strict person. If anyone worked with him and was even slightly careless, he would immediately criticize them. He often said: "If you are careless with small tasks, how can I let you interfere with big tasks?" So, under his guidance, Xie Jingyun made rapid progress.

She worked beside the blower for more than half a year, going to work and getting off work with Master Xiao. She gradually became familiar with some of the work that a blower assistant should do, and she felt extremely happy. But what the inside of the machine looked like was still a mystery. Once, a blower was being repaired, and during the break, she went to find the repairmen and made a straightforward request: "You are repairing it; can I watch?"

The repairmen said, "Repairs are not allowed to be watched by outsiders."

Xie Jingyun was not very happy when she heard them, so she repeatedly requested, "I guarantee I won't interfere with your work."

The repairmen smiled and agreed when they saw that she was really bored: "You can come, but you can't be too handsy."

Xie Jingyun nodded happily.

When a blower was disassembled, parts were placed everywhere. There were so many stories inside. Xie Jingyun saw them for the first time and looked at them carefully. "Oh! That's the impeller, that's the turbine..." she said to herself. She was able to match each piece to what she had seen on the drawings, and it was much clearer than on paper. She not only watched with great interest, but also passed wrenches, rags, and helped with small tasks, which made the repairmen feel more convenient. So, when she asked a question or two when she didn't understand something, the repairmen enthusiastically explained it to her. After watching one repair, Xie Jingyun gained a more practical understanding of the blower. She became more cautious and careful in her work. She saw the role of a small screw, and she knew the impact of a component failure on the entire machine.

Although she worked hard to study mechanical structure principles and technology, and she did a good job as an assistant, she didn't remember Master Xiao ever praising her. His demands on her were always getting stricter. Once in class, Master Xiao suddenly praised her, but the second sentence was criticism: "Jingyun, your political and ideological progress is too slow compared to your mastery of technology. You are a young person; how can you not know how to get close to your organization? I don't remember you ever talking to me about the Youth League... " Master Xiao was a little angry.

Xie Jingyun lowered her head and said with a red face, "I also want to join the League..."

Master Xiao's words reduced some of the blame and explained to her: "If you want to join the League in your heart, you must take the initiative to talk to the League organization, don't just wait for the League to come to you. Talk to the League branch about your strengths and weaknesses, and make a request; it doesn't matter if you don't meet the conditions, exercise more with the help of the League. This way, your political progress will be faster."

Master Xiao enlightened her politically, boosted her courage, and she quickly went to talk to the League branch secretary, Sun Fenghua; she briefly described her background history and also apologized to the League for her purely technical point of view. She spoke very sincerely, and the League branch gave her great encouragement and appointed League group leader Suo Pengjiu to be responsible for helping her; later, the women's committee member Zhang Fengzhen also often talked to her. After a period of training, Xie Jingyun's political thinking improved, and on February 23, 1955, she gloriously joined the Chinese New Democratic Youth League.

Not long after joining the League, there was a notice in the workshop. The content was: Before the implementation of the post wage system, all workers and technicians in the factory must generally take an exam; the position will be re-determined based on the results of this exam. She didn't know what topics would be tested, and there was not even a bit of preparation time; and she came down from the night shift - the first oral exam would begin after 8:30 in the morning. During working hours, Xie Jingyun did not bother to guess the questions, fearing that a moment of inattention would cause an accident; furthermore, she felt that there might be no problem in passing the assistant exam, and it would be good to be an assistant for another two years to get training.

After getting off work, washing her face, and changing her clothes, the people on the night shift gathered together, and they were called into the room one by one to take the exam. Xie Jingyun was the last one to be called in. There was no sound in the room. A member of the examination committee pointed to the only empty seat in the middle. She sat down. Xie Jingyun felt a little nervous when she saw such a serious scene, and immediately felt hot, and sweat gradually appeared on her forehead. Xie Jingyun drew a lot from the teacup. A member of the examination committee took it and let the members of the committee look at it, and read the test question to her twice: "What tools should be prepared before starting up?"

Xie Jingyun thought for a moment, and quickly answered item by item: "Vibration meter, hand-held tachometer, stethoscope, operation card, log paper, flashlight..."

After answering the three questions of the oral exam, this session ended. On the way out, some old masters said to her: "You answered very well."

The next day, a test of ten written questions was held in the club. Because these contents had been learned in the past, she still remembered them, so she handed in the paper quickly.

The last test was practical operation. It was carried out on a spare machine. Xie Jingyun was not flustered at all. She inspected the work upstairs and downstairs in order, prepared the tools, contacted the blast furnace, boiler, pump station, and dispatch room, opened the main steam valve, turned on the circulating water, and tested the electric oil pump... She followed what she had learned from books, what she had learned from old masters, and her past observations of drivers starting the machine. After twenty procedures, it took a total of one hour and thirty minutes to start the blower to the normal air supply speed. Each member of the examination committee looked at her entire operation process and marked the score she deserved in the logbook.

A few days later, the exam results were announced: Xie Jingyun passed the blower driver exam; with an average of seventy-seven points, she ranked second in the second blower room. When she first heard others call her "Master Xie," her face turned red, and she pleaded, "Just call me Xie Jingyun."

The workers, old masters, foreman, and shift supervisor all excitedly shook her hand and congratulated her. Before and after she took on the new position, the factory director and the secretary of the Youth League general branch had cordial talks with her; the organization cared for her like their own children, encouraging her not to be proud and to unite with the masses. She was asked to continue to learn from the old masters and learn from the masses; to teach others patiently as Master Xiao taught her... Xie Jingyun listened carefully and kept every word of the comrades in her heart. She felt that the comrades cared for her more carefully than she cared for herself, even more than her parents. While she was deeply moved, new strength was stored in her heart.

Xie Jingyun has been operating independently for more than half a year without violating the operating procedures once or causing even a minor accident. Avoiding accidents is particularly important for blowers, and it takes a lot of effort and energy to achieve this. Not to mention the danger of an accident to the blower itself, even a general stoppage means stopping iron, steel, and rolling, and even halting construction. The loss to us is great. Under the leadership of the Party and the direct education of the League organization, she realized this, and she understood that her work was directly related to the speed of socialist construction. So, during the eight hours of her shift, when she was sending more than 100,000 cubic meters of wind to the No. 6 blast furnace, she felt the importance of her responsibility, felt the trust of the Party and the people in her, and her spirit did not waver for a minute; what her eyes saw, what her ears heard, what her heart thought, there was nothing but the blower. "Not too much, not too little" - delivering the amount of air needed by the blast furnace was the greatest comfort to her. Whenever she learned that the famous "Youth League Furnace" - No. 6 furnace - had produced another batch of high-quality iron ahead of schedule, she was so excited that she almost jumped up.

Blowers are very complex and require high skills to operate them. Xie Jingyun is just a very young graduate from a rural elementary school. Thanks to the cultivation of the Party and her own hard work, she learned to operate in less than two years, and because she mastered the performance of the machine, she operated it very well. This is the victory of the Party and the people, and it is a manifestation of the superiority of the social system we have established. Our industrial construction is rising unprecedentedly, and it needs thousands of young people to be like Xie Jingyun, quickly master the technology, be loyal to their posts, and work selflessly for the country. Xie Jingyun was only valued by the Party and the workers because she did this, and everyone elected her to attend the advanced producers' representative meeting convened by the Ministry of Heavy Industry; and at this meeting, she was consecutively elected as a representative to the National Advanced Producers Conference.

    鼓风机旁的姑娘
    谷峪
    在巨大的鼓风机旁站着一位小姑娘，这就是二十一岁的青年女司机谢景云同志。她在鼓风机的身旁不住地走着，这里听听看看，那里摸摸，她的工作像是比较轻松、悠闲，可是她的心里是那样的紧张。工作要求她的精神高度集中，她的眼睛看着差不多三十个仪器表所指示的数字，耳朵还要从听音器里听着机器内部的声音；她通过看和听来判断各个机件的运转情况。机器必须按她的意图来旋转，小姑娘是大机器的主人。
    解放前，一个农村生长的女孩子，她没有想到能够到重工业工厂来工作，更不用说自己独立操作这样大的机器了。她从小所看到的是本村那些姐姐、嫂嫂们，娶进来，嫁出去，围着锅台转。她也曾模糊地怀疑过：是不是自己的将来也和她们一样？因为自己生在贫农的家庭，哥哥上学都没有办法，那能轮到一个“黄毛丫头”。那时她每天抱妹妹，妹妹睡下了她还要去地里剜些野菜，回来掺在面里吃。上学是人家的事。
    解放的那年，她十岁，忽然间天地变了。老人们、媳妇们都扭啊，唱啊，她也和许多小姑娘们一起，手拉着手，跑着、跳着进了完全小学校。从这一天起，铅笔一根根地在她的手中缩短和消失，不知不觉，六年级最后的一本书就要念完了。
    鞍钢的恢复和扩建给她带来了兴奋和鼓舞。从报纸广告栏里看，许多厂矿向她招手。于是她在老师的鼓励和爹娘的允许下来到鞍山，在电修厂的俱乐部里她交出自己的试卷，考上了第一名，当了工人。
    谢景云离开妈妈离开家，第一次睡在职工宿舍的那天晚上，通宿没有合眼。她太高兴了。她一个个地想着白天新认识的那些同志，个个都是那样可亲，和兄弟姐妹一样。她想着人事科那位同志给他们讲的话，更是觉得能在鞍钢工作真是光荣！她下定决心，一定学好本事，为祖国服务。
    谢景云来到鞍山钢铁公司发电厂最初的日子是学习。在结束了一星期的保安学习之后，随着开始了技术理论的学习——“透平机的原理构造”。她在学习中遇到的第一个困难，是看不懂图。图上的一横道、一竖道，一个方空、一个三角，她不懂得这些代表着什么。她不懂就问。在课堂她问老师，老师耐心地给她解释，把纸上的图重新一笔笔地画在黑板上，放大开来，反复地讲，直到她两眉当中的结舒展开来为止。课余的时候，在宿舍里她也和别的同学研究，或者自己到一个地方静静地思索。在初夏夜短的时候，有的同学已经睡下，她还在那里想，在那里画，她为理解一个公式、一个原理而兴奋得拍起手来。头一个困难克服以后，虽然从图上懂了，但是理论知识和实物结合不起来。一个庞大的鼓风机的整体，是被铁衣包裹起来的。即使走到它的身旁，看见的是仪器，它的内部秘密是很难猜测的。因此谢景云天天都在为猜透鼓风机的秘密而苦恼。在课堂上她和其他同学一样，向老师提了一些天真的问题：“老师，真空是什么样子的？”老师费很大的力气，也难找出完满的回答；解释到最后还不得不说：“真空是看不见的。”
    三个多月的技术理论学习很快过去，谢景云被分配到二十一号机上去实习。这里的值班长是萧春华同志，共产党员，他对谢景云的帮助很大。他不单在谢景云问的时候耐心地、反复地讲，而且在谢景云不问的时候，他还反问她。一个初到机器房的人，那轰隆隆的声音使你听不到别人的话声，萧师傅凑近她的耳朵大声地喊，一面还用笔画图解释。小姑娘很快就成了萧师傅喜爱的学徒工，他喜欢她的泼辣、做活灵巧，勤谨。那是正在提倡“生产文明”的时候，谢景云每天都把地擦的溜光，把机器擦的净亮。萧师傅是个严格的人，如果谁和他一起工作，有半点马虎，他立刻批评，他常说：“小活上马虎，大活怎么能让你插手呢。”所以谢景云在他的教导下，进步很快。
    她在鼓风机旁工作了多半年，和萧师傅一起上班、下班，鼓风机助手应该做的一些工作，她渐渐熟悉起来，她心里快活极了。但是机器内部到底什么样子还是个谜。有一次一台鼓风机检修，在休息的时候，她去找检修工，向他们提出直率的要求：“你们检修，我来看看行不？”
    检修工说：“检修不让外人看。”
    谢景云听了他们的话不大高兴，就再三要求：“保证不妨碍你们的工作。”
    检修工人见她实在闷得慌，就笑笑答应了：“你来也行，可不许多手多脚。”
    谢景云高兴地点了点头。
    一台鼓风机拆开，零件摆了一大片，里边是那么多的故事。谢景云第一次看到它们的样子，仔细地瞧着。“呵！这就是风轮，那就是汽轮……”她心里说，一件一件都能和过去在图上见的对得上头，而且比在图纸上明白多了。她不但满有兴趣地看，还给他们递送扳子、抹布、帮点小忙，这样检修工倒感到了一些方便。所以当她有不懂的地方问一句两句，检修工也热情地给她解释。谢景云看了一次检修以后，对鼓风机更有了实际的了解。对自己工作更加谨慎细心起来，她看到了一个小螺丝的作用，她知道了一个部件的故障对整个机器所起的影响。
    尽管她努力钻研机械构造原理和技术，助手工作又做得好，可是她没有记得萧师傅在什么时候夸奖过她，对她的要求总是愈来愈加严格。有一次在班上，萧师傅突然夸奖了一句，但是第二句就批评上了：“景云，你政治思想进步和你掌握技术的进步比起来可太慢了。你是个青年，怎么不知道靠近自己的组织呢？我不记得你和我谈过一次青年团的事情。………”萧师傅有些生气。
    谢景云把头低下，红着脸说：“我也想入团………”
    萧师傅的话里减少了一些责备，向她解释说：“心里要求入团，就要主动地去找团组织谈谈，别光盼团来找你。找团支部谈谈自己的优点、缺点，提出要求；不够条件不怕，在团的帮助下再锻炼。这样政治上进步就快了。”
    萧师傅从政治上开导了她，鼓足了她的勇气，她很快找团支书孙凤华去谈话；她简单地叙述了出身历史，还向团检讨了自己的单纯技术观点。她谈得很诚恳，团支部给了她很大鼓励，并且指定团小组长索鹏九负责帮助她；以后妇女委员张凤珍也经常找她谈话。经过一个时期的锻炼，谢景云的政治思想有了提高，1955年的2月23日，她光荣地加入了中国新民主主义青年团。
    入团后不久，车间里有一个通知。内容是：施行岗位工资制以前，全厂的工人、技术人员都要普遍进行一次考试；根据这次考试的成绩重新确定职务。她不知道要考些什么题目，连一点准备时间都没有；而且她从夜班下来——早八点半钟以后就要开始第一场口试，正在工作时间，谢景云没有顾得去猜测题目，怕精神一时不集中会出事故；再就是，她自己觉得考上助手可能没有什么问题，再当二年助手锻炼锻炼也有好处。
    下了班，洗罢脸，换好衣服，夜班的人都集合到一起去，一个一个地被叫到屋里去考试。谢景云是最后一个被喊进去的。屋子里没有一点声音，一位考试委员会的委员向她指了指中间仅有的一个空位子。她坐下了。谢景云看到这样严肃的场面，心里有些紧张，立刻感到燥热，汗珠渐渐浮上了她的额头。谢景云从茶缸里抽出一根签，考试委员会的一个委员接过去让各委员过了目，就给她读了两遍试题：“在启动前应该准备好哪些工具？”
    谢景云略想了一下，就很快地一项一项答下去：“震动表、手携式转速表、听音器、操作牌、日记纸、手电筒……”
    把口试的三个题目答完，这一场就结束了。在往外走的时候，有的老师傅对她说：“你答得很好。”
    第二天，在俱乐部又举行了一场十道文字试题的测验。因为这些内容过去都学过，她还记得，所以很快就交卷了。
    最后一项考试是实际操作。是在一台预备机上进行的。谢景云没有一点慌张，有先有后地检查了上下屋的工作，把工具准备好，联系了高炉、锅炉、水泵站、调度室，开了总汽道汽门，通好循环水，试验了电动油泵……她按照素日向书本学的，向老师傅学的，还有以往对司机发动机器留心观察的记忆，经过二十道手续，共花一点三十分钟的时间，把鼓风机发动到正常送风的速度。考试委员会的每个委员，看了她的整个操作过程，在日记本上划下应得的分数。
    过了几天，考试结果公布出来：谢景云考上了鼓风机司机；平均七十七分，第二鼓风室她考了第二名。当她第一次听到别人称呼她“谢师傅”的时候，她的脸红起来，央求说：“还是喊我谢景云吧。”
    工友们、老师傅们、工长、值班主任，都兴奋地向她握手祝贺。在她走上新的岗位的前后，厂长、青年团总支书记都先后和她作了亲切的谈话；组织像爱护自己的儿女一样爱护她，勉励她不要骄傲，要和群众团结在一起。要她继续向老师傅学习，向群众学习；耐心教别人和萧师傅教她一样……谢景云仔细地听着，把同志们的一言一语都记在心里。她觉得同志们关心自己比自己、比爹娘还周到。在她深受感动的同时，她的心里又蕴藏下了新的力量。
    谢景云单独操作，半年多的时间没有违反过一次操作规程，没有出过一次小事故。避免事故，对鼓风机来说是特别重要的，做到这一点也必须付出许多心血和精力。不讲一次事故对鼓风机本身的危险性，就是一般地停一下车就意味着停铁、停钢、停轧，以至建设停工。它对我们的损失是很大的，在党的领导和团组织的直接教育下，她意识到了这一点，她理解到自己的工作和社会主义建设速度的快慢有直接的关系。所以她在班上的八个小时，在给六号高炉送着十几万立方公尺风的时候，她感到自己责任的重大，感到了党和人民对自己的信任，她的精神没有一分钟涣散；眼睛看的、耳朵听的、心里想的，除了鼓风机以外再没有别的什么。“不多不少”——按照高炉的需要送出了风量，对她来说这是最大的安慰。当她每次知道有名的“共青团炉”——六号炉又提前出了一炉优质铁的时候，她兴奋得几乎跳起来。
    鼓风机是非常复杂的，需要很高的技术来操作它。谢景云不过是一个很年轻的、刚从农村出来的高小毕业生，由于党的培养和她自己的勤学苦练，不到二年的时间就学会了操作，而且由于掌握了机器的性能，操作得很好。这是党和人民的胜利，是我们所建立的社会制度的优越性的表现。我国的工业建设正在空前地高涨起来，它需要千万青年都能像谢景云一样，迅速地掌握技术，忠实于自己的岗位，忘我地为祖国尊作。谢景云也仅仅因为做到了这点，便受到了党和工人的工重，大家选她出席了重工业部召开的先进生产者代表会议；并且在这次会上被连选为出席全国先进生产者会议的代表。
