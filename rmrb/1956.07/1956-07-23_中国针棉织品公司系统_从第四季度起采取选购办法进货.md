Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 21st - The state-owned commercial system will adopt a bottom-up, free selection of goods procurement method, starting with the China National Knitwear and Cotton Goods Company system from the fourth quarter. The first manager's conference of the China National Knitwear and Cotton Goods Company, which closed in Tianjin on the 20th, proposed a series of implementation measures for free selection and purchase.

The implementation of free selection and purchase will encourage state-owned commercial procurement and supply stations in various regions to actively assist industrial departments in improving production and enhancing product quality. At the same time, lower-level wholesale stations and grassroots stores will be able to purchase goods according to local consumption needs, which can avoid or reduce the phenomenon of certain commodities being "out of stock here and stockpiled there" that often occurred in the past.

The meeting decided that, in addition to more than a dozen commodities in short supply, such as high-end towels and wool, which will still be uniformly distributed by the head office, the remaining commodities can be purchased freely.

    中国针棉织品公司系统
    从第四季度起采取选购办法进货
    新华社天津21日电　国营商业系统采取自下而上的自由选购商品的办法，将从第四季度起在中国针棉织品公司系统内首先实行。二十日在天津闭幕的中国针棉织品公司第一届经理会议，对自由选购提出了一系列的实施办法。
    实行自由选购，将促使各地国营商业采购供应站积极协助工业部门改进生产，提高产品质量，同时下级批发站和基层商店能够根据当地消费的需要进货，可以避免或减少过去经常发生的某些商品“此处脱销、彼处积压”的现象。
    会议决定，除了部分高档毛巾、毛线等十多种供不应求的商品，仍由总公司统一分配以外，对其余的商品都可采取自由选购的办法进货。
