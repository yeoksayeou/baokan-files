Xinhua News Agency, 8th: Two hundred new styles of leather shoes suitable for various foot shapes have recently been trial-produced in Beijing. This is the first collaborative effort in Beijing by twelve skilled shoemakers from eight major cities including Shanghai, Shenyang, Wuhan, Chongqing, and Beijing to produce new products.

　　The two hundred pairs of new shoes vary in style and color. Among them, one hundred and ten types are women's shoes, which are not only aesthetically pleasing but also have bright colors; particularly attractive are some braided leather shoes, where the skilled shoemakers use colored leather straps to weave various beautiful patterns. Although the fifty types of men's shoes have fewer colors on the uppers, the shoemakers cleverly use different shapes of leather to piece together various patterns. Among the two hundred new shoes, there are also children's shoes, sports shoes, and Tibetan boots worn by the Tibetan people.

　　These leather shoes are all made according to different foot shapes. Before making the shoes, the experienced shoemakers measured the foot shapes of more than 7,000 people in factories, rural areas, schools, and government offices in Beijing. Based on the results of the measurements, they comprehensively analyzed the data and first created wooden shoe lasts for various foot shapes. Using these wooden shoe lasts, they further studied styles and colors, and also collected shoemaking materials and samples from the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, and other countries, finally designing and manufacturing various new styles of leather shoes. This will enable people with various foot shapes, such as those that are too wide or too narrow, to choose new leather shoes that are both beautiful and comfortable to wear.

　　These skilled shoemakers were invited to Beijing by the former Ministry of Local Industry. They are now separately organizing the technical data such as foot shape measurements and operating procedures from this trial production of new products, preparing to provide them to the shoemaking industry in various regions for reference. The newly trial-produced products will also be publicly exhibited in Beijing to solicit more extensive consumer feedback.

### 十二名制鞋能手聚集北京  试制成两百种新式样皮鞋

    十二名制鞋能手聚集北京
    试制成两百种新式样皮鞋
    新华社8日讯　两百种适合各种脚型的新式皮鞋，最近在北京试制出来了。这是上海、沈阳、武汉、重庆、北京等八个大城市的十二位制鞋能手，第一次聚集在北京合作的新产品。
    这两百双新鞋的式样花色各不相同。其中一百一十种女鞋，不仅外形美观，而且花色鲜明；特别好看的是一些编花皮鞋，制鞋能手们用彩色的皮带编成各种美丽图案。五十种男鞋虽然鞋面颜色种类不多，可是制鞋工匠却巧妙地用不同形状的皮子拼成了各种花样。在两百种新鞋中，还有一部分是童鞋、运动鞋和藏族人民穿的藏靴。
    这些皮鞋都是根据不同脚型做出来的。富有经验的制鞋能手们在制鞋以前，曾经在北京的工厂、农村、学校、机关，先后测量了七千多人的脚型。他们根据测量的结果加以综合分析，首先制出了各种脚型的木鞋楦。用这些木鞋楦，他们又互相研究了式样、花色，还搜集了苏联、捷克斯洛伐克等国的制鞋资料、样本，最后才设计和制造出了各种新式样的皮鞋。这样将使那些肥大、瘦小等各种脚型的人，都能选择到穿起来又好看又舒适的新皮鞋。
    这些制鞋能手是前地方工业部邀请到北京来的。现在他们正分头整理这次试制新产品的脚型测量、操作过程等技术资料，准备供给各地制鞋工业参考。已经试制出来的新产品还要在北京公开展览，更广泛地征求消费者的意见。
