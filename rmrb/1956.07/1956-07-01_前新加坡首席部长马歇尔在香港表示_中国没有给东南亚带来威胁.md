Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, June 30th: Former Singapore Chief Minister David Marshall said here on the evening of June 29th that China does not pose a threat to Southeast Asia.
    He received an invitation from Zhang Xiruo, President of the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs, to visit China while passing through here on his way to Japan by boat. He considered China's invitation to him to be a magnanimous gesture, saying, "I must admit that, considering I am known for opposing communism, and considering that for fourteen months, I have consistently stated that communism would mean economic ruin for Singapore, I greatly admire their courage in inviting me." He then added, "I think people should respect them and not assume they have bad intentions."
    Marshall served as Singapore's Chief Minister for fourteen months before resigning in June this year.
    He hopes that when he visits China after his trip to Japan, he will be able to see China's industrial development, housing, and education. He also said, "I want to hold talks with China's great leaders. I think any conversation I have with Chinese leaders could be beneficial, and there would be no harm in such a conversation."

    前新加坡首席部长马歇尔在香港表示
    中国没有给东南亚带来威胁
    据新华社香港30日电　前新加坡首席部长马歇尔六月二十九日晚间在这里说：中国并没有给东南亚带来威胁。
    他在乘船前往日本的途中路过这里的时候接到了中国人民外交学会会长张奚若邀他访问中国的请帖。他认为中国邀请他访问是一个宽宏大量的举动，他说：“我必须承认，考虑到我是以反对共产主义著称的，并且考虑到在十四个月内，我一直表明共产主义对于新加坡将意味着经济的毁灭，我十分钦佩他们邀请我的勇气。”他接着又添上说：“我认为人们应该尊重他们，不要认为他们有不良的意图。”
    马歇尔在今年六月辞职以前，曾经担任新加坡首席部长十四个月。
    他希望他在结束他的日本之行以后到中国访问的时候能够看看中国的工业发展、住宅和教育情况。他还说：“我想要同中国的伟大的领袖们举行会谈。我认为我同中国领袖们举行的任何交谈可能是有益的，这种交谈不会有任何害处。”
