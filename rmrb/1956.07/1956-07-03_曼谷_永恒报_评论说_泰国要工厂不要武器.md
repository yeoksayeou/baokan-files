Xinhua News Agency, 2nd dispatch from Bangkok: The "Eternity Daily" of Bangkok published an editorial on June 27th, commenting on China's unconditional economic aid of 8 million pounds to Cambodia, stating: "Unconditional aid will undoubtedly greatly benefit the government receiving the aid, because it will be able to truly and smoothly work for the collective interests of the people."

The editorial pointed out that what Thailand currently lacks most is factories, but the military and economic aid that the United States gives to Thailand is all finished products. The United States has never helped Thailand establish various necessary factories. Therefore, when the aid of finished products is used up, it is necessary to purchase them from the United States, making Thailand dependent on the United States and continue to use American goods.

The editorial said: "We need factories, not weapons." Hoping to always rely on other countries is definitely not a long-term solution.

    曼谷“永恒报”评论说
    泰国要工厂不要武器
    新华社2日讯　曼谷消息：“永恒报”六月二十七日发表社论，评论中国无条件给予柬埔寨八百万英镑的经济援助说：“无条件的援助必然大大有利于接受援助的政府，因为它将能够真正地和顺利地为人民集体的利益而工作”。
    社论指出，泰国目前最缺少的是工厂，但是美国在军事上和经济上所给予泰国的援助却全部是制成品，美国从未援助过泰国建立各种必要的工厂。因此当援助的制成品消耗完了之后，就必须向美国购买，使得泰国必须同美国联系，继续使用美国货物。
    社论说：“我们需要工厂而不是武器”。希望一直依靠其他国家，肯定地不是长远的办法。
