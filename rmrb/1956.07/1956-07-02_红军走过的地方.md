    The Places the Red Army Passed Through
    Zhang Linshu
    The rich northern part of Sichuan Province has a famous mountain called Daba Mountain. This is the "Sichuan-Shaanxi Revolutionary Base Area," a place the Red Army passed through in the past.
    Today, our young exploration team members have come here. We saw the thatched huts where people who had been driven up the mountains by the White bandits used to live, which are now used by the commune to store fertilizer. The narrow mountain paths that the Red Army once traveled have now become wide roads where cars can travel freely.
    Right on the earth mound where the Red Army once planted their red flag, our exploration team's red flag is now flying. In the places where the Red Army once tethered their warhorses, our exploration team's pack donkeys are now tied. In this Daba Mountain where wild animals roam, in front of the Jianmen Pass where one dares not look down, we sit in shelters made of tents or mats, telling the stories of the Red Army's Long March over and over again. We forget our fatigue, we forget our hardships.
    These dozens of continuous mountain peaks are often shrouded in clouds and mist. Sometimes wind, snow, and hail suddenly strike, making it difficult for us to work. However, the Red Army conquered them in the past, so would today's exploration team members be frightened! When our water bottles are empty, snow becomes the "ice cream" that our team members love. When we are soaked by the rain, the wind becomes the best fan, drying our clothes for us. Heavy fog, fierce mountain floods, and frequent hail have never made us yield.
    Last winter, we were surveying a coalfield on Jianmen Mountain. It was freezing cold, with a heavy snowstorm. We used umbrellas to cover the instruments and took off our raincoats to cover the newly drawn maps. The people sitting and calculating wore tree branch circles like bamboo hats on their heads. Soon, the umbrellas and branch hats were covered with thick snow, looking like white mushrooms from a distance. After finishing work, people looked at each other and laughed: we really look like the old boatman in "Autumn River." Some team members imitated the boatman's movements and sang: "Cast the fishing hook on both sides, ya me zi, yo, where can such happiness be found!"
    In the Jianmen Pass and Longshendian area, regardless of the season, there is a storm every three or four days. The local residents divide this wind into "male wind" and "female wind." They say: "The male wind blows to dry your clothes, the female wind blows to break your heart." When the wind blows, it often wakes people up from their dreams in the middle of the night. Everyone has to get up and tighten the "Latins" at the foot of the tent. Sometimes, when walking on the edge of a rock or on a bridge, when the wind blows, the team members have to immediately stick their bodies to the rock wall or hug a big tree, or immediately "lie down" in place. Otherwise, the wind will blow people over.
    June, the mountain flood season is coming. In order to complete the task before this, the exploration team members came up with a plan to work day and night in double shifts, with one shift doing the work of two shifts.
    In the early morning, the moon has not yet set, and the stars are still twinkling. When we hand over the shift, the moon and the sun are also handing over the shift.
    At noon, hot meals are delivered from several miles away, but who is willing to stop the machines to eat! It is always after several hours, when the second shift takes over, that they pick up their bowls.
    The tents are sometimes set up next to the drilling site, where there are rock caves where pythons often live, jungles where leopards roam, and "night-howling trees" where owls perch. We tie ropes to the "night-howling trees" and use oil drums to block the tunnels where pythons travel. When we are sound asleep, owls walk back and forth beside us, and playful frogs always jump onto our beds and pillows. Disobedient crickets also love to crawl into our boots or beside our bowls and make noise non-stop, but all of this cannot disturb the sound sleep of our exploration team members.
    When we victoriously completed our task ahead of schedule, singing joyful songs, and went down the mountain to spend a vacation, when we passed the "Wulongbao" where the Red Army and the White bandits had fought a bloody battle, our hearts were excited. Our singing was also louder....

### 红军走过的地方

    红军走过的地方
    张林枢
    富饶的四川省北部，有座出名的大山——大巴山。这就是“川陕边革命根据地”，红军当年走过的地方。
    今天，我们年青的勘探队员来到了这里。我们看见了从前被白匪赶上山去的人们住过的茅棚，如今已成社里存放肥料的地方，从前红军走过的羊肠小道，今天已经变成可以畅行汽车的大路了。
    就在当年红军插过红旗的土岗上，如今飘扬着我们勘探队的红旗。当年红军拴过战马的地方，今天又系上了我们勘探队的驮驴。在这野兽出没的大巴山上，在这眼睛不敢下望的剑门关前，我们坐在用帐篷或席子搭成的棚子里，总是一遍又一遍讲着红军长征的故事。我们忘记了疲倦，忘记了艰苦。
    这几十个连绵的山峰，常常是被云雾笼罩着。有时风雪、冰雹突然袭来，使我们难于进行工作。但是，当年红军曾征服了它们，难道今天会吓住了勘探队员！我们的水壶干了，雪就变成队员们喜欢的“冰淇凌”；我们浑身都被雨水淋湿的时候，风，就成了最好的电扇，为我们吹干了衣衫；重重的浓雾，凶猛的山洪，经常的冰雹，都没有叫我们屈服。
    去年冬天，我们正在剑门山上勘测煤田，正是天寒地冻，弥天的大风雪，我们用伞遮着仪器，把雨衣脱下盖着刚刚绘好的图纸。坐着计算的人，头上戴一个像斗笠一样的树条圈，一会儿伞上、树条帽上都落满了厚厚的雪，远远看去像一朵朵的白蘑菇。工作完毕，人们彼此看着，说笑起来：我们真像“秋江”里的老艄翁了。有的队员学着艄翁的动作，唱起：“两旁撒下钓鱼钩，呀么子，吆，这样的快乐哪里有！”
    在剑门关、龙神殿一带，不分季节，每隔三、四天总有一次暴风。当地居民把这风分成“公风”和“母风”。他们说：“公风吹来吹衣裳，母风吹来吹断肠。”风一吹起来，夜半常常把人从梦中惊醒，大家得起来把帐篷脚下的“拉丁”弄紧。有时正行走在岩边或桥上的时候，风一吹来，队员们就得马上将身子贴在岩壁上或是抱住根大树，或者马上在原地“卧倒”。不然，风会把人吹倒了。
    六月，山洪期要来了。为了要在这以前完成任务，勘探队员想出了日夜轮双班的办法，一个班要顶两个班的事。
    清晨，月亮还没落，星星还在眨眼。当我们交班的时候，月亮和太阳也正交班。
    中午，从几里路外送来了热饭，然而谁又肯让机器停下来去吃饭呢！总是过了几个小时，第二班接班时，才端起饭碗。
    帐篷有时就搭在钻场的旁边，这里有蟒蛇常住的岩洞、有豹子出没的丛林，有猫头鹰站脚的“夜嚎树”……。我们把绳子拴在“夜嚎树”下，用机油桶去塞住蟒蛇行走的峒洞。当我们睡熟的时候，猫头鹰在我们身旁来回的走动，调皮的青蛙，总是蹦到我们的床上、枕边，不听话的蟋蟀也爱钻到靴里或是碗边来不停的吵闹，可是这一切怎么也不能搅扰我们勘探队员的酣睡。
    当我们胜利地提前完成了任务，唱着愉快的歌，下山去度过一个假期的时候，当我们经过了当年红军与白匪进行过血战的“乌龙包”的时候，我们的心情是激动的。我们的歌声也更高昂了……。
