The construction area of Lu Xun's tomb is approximately 1,600 square meters. The entire tomb will be constructed with more than 2,000 cubic meters of granite and other solid stone materials. The burial chamber is located in the center of the tomb site, and the tombstone will be inscribed with Chairman Mao's personal inscription: "The Tomb of Mr. Lu Xun."

    鲁迅新墓已在上海动工修建
    据新华社上海20日电　鲁迅先生的新墓已于十九日晨七时在虹口公园正式开工修建。
    鲁迅墓建筑面积约为一千六百平方公尺。整个墓地建筑将用两千多方花冈石及其他坚固石料砌成。墓穴位在墓地正中，墓碑上将铭刻毛主席亲笔所题的“鲁迅先生之墓”。
    在鲁迅先生新墓穴的前面，将要建立一座鲁迅先生塑像。
    鲁迅先生新墓地工程预定九月下旬完成。完工以后，鲁迅先生墓就要从偏僻的万国公墓移到距离鲁迅故居很近、又是鲁迅生前经常散步的地方来。
    与鲁迅墓同处一园的鲁迅纪念陈列馆，也已在二日开工修建。陈列馆工程将和墓地工程同时完成。
