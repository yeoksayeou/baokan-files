Xinhua News Agency, London, July 3rd: Ceylon Prime Minister Bandaranaike said yesterday that the Commonwealth should become a "third force" between the Soviet Union and the United States. He said that this would not be a third bloc in the "sense of aggression", but could be "a great force for maintaining world peace."

Bandaranaike, speaking at a press conference in London, said he wanted to "explore further" his concept of a "third force". He said that the Commonwealth countries can no longer "deceive themselves" and must face the question of whether the Commonwealth is merely a "nebula" or has "any concrete use," and whether it will "dissolve in some not-too-distant day or become closer and more intimate based on certain moral principles." He believes that if the Commonwealth cannot become what he calls a "third force," Asian countries may split off and seek to express this desire in a new regional treaty.

Bandaranaike said he is considering establishing a regional cooperation organization for countries in the "Indian Ocean basin". He emphasized that this organization should not be a military alliance, but should be an organization to promote closer economic, cultural and political cooperation, "a closer agreement than that between the Colombo countries."

Bandaranaike said that Ceylon "generally agrees" with the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. Ceylon and India have "generally the same views" on foreign policy, although there are some differences. He said that Ceylon wants to stay completely out of the "big power blocs."

In answering questions, Bandaranaike expressed regret that China has not yet been admitted to the United Nations. At the same time, he expressed support for the proposition of so-called "two Chinas" which is opposed by the Chinese people.

Bandaranaike said he hopes to visit the United States when he goes to New York to attend the United Nations General Assembly in November this year. He said he also hopes to visit the Soviet Union next year, and then visit China, although no arrangements have yet been made for these visits.

    锡兰总理主张
    英联邦应成为“第三种力量”
    据新华社3日电　伦敦消息：锡兰总理班达拉奈克昨天说，英联邦应当成为苏联和美国之间的“第三种力量”。他说，这不是“侵略意义”上的第三个集团，而可能是“维护世界和平的一种巨大力量”。
    班达拉奈克在伦敦举行的一个记者招待会上发表谈话的时候，表示要“进一步细细探讨”他的关于“第三种力量”的概念。他说，英联邦各国再也不能“自欺”了，它们必须面对英联邦究竟仅仅是“一团星云”还是有“任何具体用处”的问题，面对“在将在某个不远的日子解散或者是根据某些道义原则变得更加密切和亲密”的问题。他认为，如果英联邦不能成为他所说的“第三种力量”，亚洲国家就可能分裂出去，而在一项新的区域性条约中设法表现它们的这种愿望。
    班达拉奈克说，他正在考虑建立“印度洋流域”各国的区域性合作组织的问题。他强调指出，这个组织不应当是军事联盟，而应当是促进较为密切的经济、文化和政治合作的组织，是“比科伦坡国家之间更加密切的一种协议”。
    班达拉奈克说，锡兰“一般地同意”和平共处的五项原则。锡兰和印度在外交政策方面“总的看法是相同的”，虽然也有一些差异。他表示锡兰要完全置身于“大国集团”之外。
    班达拉奈克在回答问题的时候，对目前没有接纳中国进入联合国表示遗憾，同时，他又表示赞成为中国人民所反对的关于所谓“两个中国”的主张。
    班达拉奈克表示希望在今年十一月他去纽约参加联合国大会的时候能够访问美国。他说他还希望明年能够访问苏联，然后访问中国，虽然还没有为这些访问作好安排。
