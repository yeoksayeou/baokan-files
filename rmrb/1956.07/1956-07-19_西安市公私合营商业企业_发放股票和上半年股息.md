Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 17th. New public-private partnership commercial enterprises in Xi'an are distributing stocks and dividends for the first half of this year. As of the 13th, private shareholders in forty-two industries, including watches, general merchandise, bicycles, pastries, and preserved foods, have received newly issued stocks in public-private partnership enterprises and all dividends for the first half of this year. The remaining twenty industries will also complete distribution soon.
    Private shareholders expressed great satisfaction after receiving their stocks and dividends. Yuan Kecheng, Deputy Director and private shareholder of the Public-Private Partnership Sheng Sheng Bristle Processing Factory, said, "Before liberation, capitalist enterprises competed with each other, and those in the same trade were enemies, in a life-or-death struggle, facing an uncertain future. After the implementation of public-private partnerships, not only has the business operation greatly improved, but our work and lives have also received the care and attention of the government. Now we also have fixed interest income. We must actively manage our business and serve the people better."
