    Half a Year Digging 100,000 Cubic Meters of Earth

    The team led by Lang Yunzhi, an excellent excavator operator from the Earthwork Company of Anshan Metallurgical Chemical Construction Corporation, has completed 100,000 cubic meters of earth excavation in the first half of the year, exceeding the state plan by 208%, equivalent to 83% of the annual plan.

    Lang Yunzhi is a Communist Party member, a labor model and advanced producer in Anshan City. Over the past three years, the excavator he has operated has completed 350,000 cubic meters of earthwork and has never had a single accident due to negligence. In the tense years of constructing Angang (Anshan Iron and Steel Group), he participated in the construction of many key projects. He has personally trained 19 excavator operators. Now, he and the workers in his team have pledged to complete 500,000 cubic meters of earthwork by February 1958 without major repairs.

    半年挖土十万方
    鞍山冶金化学建筑总公司土方公司的优秀挖土机手郎运治领导的小组，上半年已经完成了十万立方公尺土方挖掘任务，超额完成国家计划208％，相等于全年计划的83％。
    郎运治是共产党员、鞍山市的劳动模范和先进生产者。三年来，他驾驶的挖土机已经完成了三十五万立方公尺的土方，从未发生过一次责任事故。在建设鞍钢的紧张岁月里，他参加了许多重点工程的建设，他亲手培养了十九名挖土机驾驶员，现在，他和他小组的工人又提出保证：到1958年2月，完成土方五十万立方公尺不进行大修。
