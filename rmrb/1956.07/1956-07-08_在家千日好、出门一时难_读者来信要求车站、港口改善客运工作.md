"Home is good for a thousand days, but going out is difficult for a moment"
-- Readers' letters request improvements in passenger transport at stations and ports

    Difficulty in buying tickets
    The ticket selling method at the Qianxi County Bus Station in Hebei Province is very bad. One day, tickets were sold at 2 p.m., and I went to stand in line at 7 a.m., but still couldn't buy a ticket. At that time, many passengers who couldn't buy tickets asked to register for advance ticket sales, but the staff at the station closed the ticket window and said, "Come to the station early to line up tomorrow!" We told them, "If we line up again tomorrow, we will have to delay another day of work. Why can't we sell advance tickets?" They said, "We don't sell them. That's the rule at our station," "It's been like this for six years."
    I came to the north from Foshan City, Guangdong Province, for official business. I have traveled to many places along the way. Bus stations like Heyuan County Bus Station and Dengta Central Bus Station in Guangdong, and Shangqiu City Bus Station in Henan, all use advance ticket sales, which is very convenient. Why does Qianxi County Bus Station stubbornly stick to the old rules of "it's been like this for six years" and refuse to give passengers any convenience?

    Ancient and Modern Marvel
    One day, at Fengcun Railway Station, south of Shijiazhuang, two female comrades came to buy tickets to Yangliuqing and Lan County. The ticket seller said, "We don't sell them! We don't know where these two stations are, and we don't know the ticket prices. It takes too much time to look them up." Helplessly, one of the comrades had to beg bitterly and say many nice things before she was allowed to buy a ticket to Shijiazhuang. Why sell her a ticket to Shijiazhuang? Because the ticket seller was familiar with Shijiazhuang, knew the ticket price, and it didn't take time.
    The ticket seller doesn't know the business, doesn't know the station names, doesn't know the ticket prices, so he can refuse to sell tickets. This is truly an ancient and modern marvel. But Fengcun Station has always been like this. They often say rudely, "I don't know the ticket price," and refuse to sell tickets, as if they were perfectly justified.

    Yichang - A City of Worry for Passengers
    I went to Chongqing on official business and waited for several days in Hankou for a boat but couldn't get one. Hankou Passenger Station said that there were boats going to Chongqing from Yichang every day and told me to wait in Yichang. I listened to them and rushed to Yichang. Who knew that the situation in Yichang was even worse. I waited for seven or eight days, but there was still no boat. Some people had even waited for two weeks. It is said that Yichang Port has already accumulated two or three thousand passengers, and this is often the case. Hotels and waiting rooms are full of people. Some people have run out of travel expenses, and some have become ill because of the poor living conditions. Everyone is anxious day and night, and cannot eat or sleep in peace. But Yichang Passenger Station turns a blind eye to this situation. Not only do they not hurry to find a solution, but they say, "Our transportation is planned and cannot be carried out randomly." I really don't know what kind of plan they have made.
    I have urgent business and can't wait any longer. Please Yichang Passenger Station find a way to start the boats quickly!

    "Last bus has passed"
    Since June, municipal-level organizations in Beijing have changed to getting off work at 6:30 p.m. every day. However, the No. 34 bus has not adapted to daylight saving time and still stops running at 7:30 p.m. Every day after work, I rush to Xizhimen, and it's already close to 8 o'clock. As usual, "the last bus has passed." Walk home, but my energy is limited and I can't bear it; don't go home, and no one takes care of the children, "raising without teaching," how can I be considered to have fulfilled my responsibilities as a mother?
    Many people have raised this issue before, but it has not been resolved to this day. Now I once again call for extending the closing time of the No. 34 bus to 8 p.m. every night.

    Crowded Trains
    At 9 p.m. on June 18, the No. 64 direct train from Hankou to Beijing pulled into Hankou Station. The station broadcast said, "Please don't crowd, there are seats for those who enter the station first and those who enter the station later." Who knew that when we got into the station, it was not like that at all. Every carriage was full of people. Many passengers going from Hankou to Beijing couldn't even find a place to stand steadily, let alone find a seat. The train was in chaos, inside and out.
    It is said that Hankou Station sold three hundred extra tickets on this train, and similar things have happened more than once. We demand that Hankou Station pay attention to the safety of passengers and not sell tickets indiscriminately.

    Learn a Good Method
    I have taken the train twice from Changsha. The ticket selling method and service attitude at Changsha Station are very good. When passengers transfer here, they don't have to line up and wait. Just sit down in order, and when the time comes, the ticket seller will collect the transfer ticket and issue an iron tag. After they complete the transfer procedures, they will send the exchanged tickets to the passengers according to the number on the iron tag. The method of cutting tickets is also very good. The passengers' tickets are cut in advance, and a small wooden tag is issued. When boarding the train, just hand in the wooden tag. This avoids crowding and shortens the entry time.
    I hope other stations will also learn this good method of serving passengers.

    “在家千日好、出门一时难”
    ——读者来信要求车站、港口改善客运工作
    买票难
    河北省迁西县汽车站的售票方法很不好。有一天下午两点售票，我早上七点就去排队等着，还是没有买到票。当时许多买不到票的旅客都要求登记预售票，但是站上的工作人员把售票的窗口一关，说：“明天早点来站队吧！”我们告诉他们：“明天再来排队，又要耽搁一天工作，为什么不可以卖预售票呢？”他们却说：“不卖，我们车站就是这个规矩”，“六年来一直如此”。
    我是从广东省佛山市到北方来办公事的，一路上走过许多地方，像广东河源县汽车站和灯塔中心汽车站、河南商丘市汽车站，都采用预售票的办法，很方便。为什么迁西县汽车站死抱住“六年来一直如此”的老规矩，不肯给旅客一点便利呢？　　　　　　祝志求
    千古奇闻
    有一天，石家庄南面的冯村火车站上，来了两位女同志，要买去杨柳青和兰县的车票。售票员说：“不卖！我们不知道这两个车站在什么地方，也不知道票价，查起来太费时间。”无可奈何，其中有一位同志只得苦苦哀求，说了许多好话，才让她买了去石家庄的票。为什么要卖给她去石家庄的票呢？原来是售票员对石家庄熟悉，知道票价，不费时间。
    售票员不熟悉业务，不知道站名，不知道票价，就可以不卖票。这真是千古奇闻。但是冯村车站是一贯如此的。他们常常粗暴地说：“不知道票价”，就不卖票，好像还满有道理一样。

    宜昌——旅客的愁城
    我因公赴重庆，在汉口等了好几天船都没有等上。汉口客运站说宜昌每天都有开往重庆方面去的船，要我到宜昌去等。我听了他们的话赶到宜昌。谁知宜昌的情况更坏，一等就等了七、八天，还是没有船，甚至还有人已经等了两个星期。据说宜昌港已经积压了旅客两、三千人，而且是经常如此的。旅馆里、候船室中都住满了人。有的人吃光了旅费，有的人因为居住条件不好生了病。大家日夜着急，吃饭睡觉都不安心。但是宜昌客运站对这种情况竟熟视无睹，不但不赶快想法解决，反而说：“我们的运输是有计划的，不能乱运。”真不知道他们订的是什么样的计划。
    我是身有急务，再也等不下去了，请宜昌客运站赶快想法开船吧！

    “末车已过”
    北京市市级机关六月份以来都改成每天下午六时半下班了。可是，34路公共汽车没有适应夏令时间，还是七点半收车。我每天下班后急急忙忙赶到西直门，已经近八时，照例是“末车已过”。徒步回家吧，人的精力有限，吃不消；不回家吧，孩子没人管，“养而不教”，怎能算是尽到妈妈的责任？
    这个问题，曾有许多人提过意见，但是至今没有解决。现在我再一次呼吁：把34路公共汽车的收车时间延长到每晚八时。

    拥挤的列车
    六月十八日晚上九点钟，由汉口开往北京的64次直达客车开进汉口站。车站上广播说：“请不要拥挤，先进站后进站都有座位”，谁知进得站去，完全不是这样，每节车厢都挤满了人，许多从汉口到北京去的旅客，不要说是找个座位坐，连稳稳当当站脚的地方都找不到。车上车下，乱成一片。
    据说，汉口站在这次车上多卖了三百张票，而且类似的事情还不止一次，我们要求汉口车站重视旅客的安全，不要滥卖票。

    学一学好办法
    我从长沙坐过两次火车。长沙站的售票方法和服务态度很好。旅客在这里换车时，不必排队等。只要按着次序坐好，到时间，售票员就来收了换票证，发给一个铁牌子。他们办好换票手续后，把换好的票，按照铁牌子的号码送给旅客。剪票的办法也很好，预先把旅客的票剪好，发一个小木牌，上车时只交木牌就行。这样既避免了拥挤，也缩短了进站时间。
    希望其他车站也学习他们这种为旅客服务的好办法。
