    "People's Daily" Commentary
    Economic Cooperation Among Socialist Countries is Growing Closer
    The Soviet Union is Helping People's Democratic Countries Build More Than 400 Enterprises
    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, July 28th. An article published in the Soviet newspaper "Pravda" on the 27th stated that the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries now produce about 30% of the world's industrial products. In 1955, the industrial output of these countries increased by 70% to 120% compared to 1950. The article was written by Nikitin and is titled "New Forms of Economic Cooperation Among Socialist Countries."

    The article stated that the relations between socialist countries are those of comradely cooperation and mutual assistance. The Soviet Union is helping various people's democratic countries build 446 enterprises, including helping China build 211. The Soviet Union also absorbs the advanced experiences of socialist countries in its construction.

    The article also discussed the cooperative relationships between countries. It stated that cooperation among socialist countries in national economic annual and long-term plans is of great significance. Only by working together can success be achieved in the economic competition with capitalism. This requires proportional development and the coordination of plans among socialist countries.

    When discussing the machine manufacturing industry, the article stated that there is now practically no machine or equipment that socialist countries cannot manufacture through concerted efforts. The new five-year plans of various countries pay particular attention to the mutual coordination of the machine manufacturing industry.

    The coordinated and consistent development plans for the metallurgical industry and the coal mining industry are also of great significance for accelerating the economic development of socialist countries. In order to ensure the growth of ferrous metal production in various people's democratic countries, the Soviet Union's supply of high-quality iron ore to them will increase nearly twofold in 1960 compared to 1955. This allows people's democratic countries lacking iron ore to divert funds to rebuilding existing metallurgical plants.

    Regarding the difficulties faced by European people's democratic countries in terms of coal, the article stated that the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance has suggested strengthening work in the coal mining industry, primarily in Poland and Czechoslovakia.

    “真理报”评论
    社会主义国家经济合作日益密切
    苏联帮助各人民民主国家建筑四百多个企业
    新华社莫斯科28日电　苏联“真理报”二十七日发表的一篇文章说，现在全世界工业产品中约30％是苏联和人民民主国家生产的。1955年这些国家的工业产量比1950年增加了70％到一点二倍。这篇文章是尼基京写的“社会主义国家经济合作的新形式”。
    文章说，社会主义各国间的关系是同志间的合作和互助关系。苏联帮助各人民民主国家建筑446个企业，其中帮助中国建筑211个。苏联在建设中也吸收社会主义各国的先进经验。
    文章还论述到各国间的合作关系。它说，社会主义国家在国民经济年度和远景计划方面的合作有重大的意义。只有共同努力才能在和资本主义经济竞赛中获得成功。这要求有比例的发展和社会主义各国间计划的协调。
    文章谈到机器制造业的时候说，现在实际上已经没有那种机器和设备是社会主义国家协同努力所不能制造出来的了。各国的新五年计划特别注意机器制造业的互相协调。
    冶金工业和采煤工业发展计划的协调一致，对加速社会主义各国经济发展也有非常重要的意义。为了保证各人民民主国家黑色金属生产的增长，苏联供应它们的高质量的铁矿砂在1960年要比1955年增长近一倍。这就使得缺乏铁矿的人民民主国家可以把资金转用到改建现有的冶金工厂方面去。
    谈到欧洲人民民主国家在煤炭方面的困难的时候，文章说，经济互助委员会已经建议首先在波兰和捷克斯洛伐克加强采煤工业方面的工作。
