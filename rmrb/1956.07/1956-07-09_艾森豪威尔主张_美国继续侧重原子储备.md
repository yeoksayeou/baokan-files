    Eisenhower Advocates
    US Continues to Focus on Atomic Stockpiles
    Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 8th: President Eisenhower recently stated that the United States "should still primarily focus on producing (atomic) stockpiles for weapons."
    In a letter dated June 13 to Representative Anderson, Chairman of the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy of both Houses of Congress, Eisenhower expressed his opposition to the suggestion of establishing a unified "atomic energy bank" in the United States for the production of fissionable materials for both weapons and peaceful purposes, because he believes that the existing reserves of fissionable materials should be prioritized for atomic armament. The White House only recently released Eisenhower's letter.

    艾森豪威尔主张
    美国继续侧重原子储备
    新华社8日讯　华盛顿消息：艾森豪威尔总统最近表示美国现在“仍然应当首先注意生产武器的（原子）储备”。
    艾森豪威尔在六月十三日致国会两院原子能联合委员会主席安德逊的信中表示他反对在美国建立生产武器和和平用途的分裂物质的统一“原子能银行”的建议因为他认为现有的分裂物质的储备应当优先用于原子军备。白宫在最近才发表艾森豪威尔的这封信。
