Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 29th. Shaanxi Province has completed the harvesting of over 24 million mu of wheat. Although the Guanzhong area experienced rain during the wheat harvest, causing some losses in certain areas, the province's total wheat production this year still reached approximately 5 billion jin, an increase of over 38% compared to last year. Both the total wheat harvest and the average yield per unit area this year have exceeded the highest levels in history.

    Of the more than 24 million mu of wheat harvested in the province this year, more than 13 million mu were planted with the high-quality variety "Bima No. 1," which yields about 30 jin of wheat per mu more than local varieties.

    Shaanxi Province is one of China's major wheat-producing regions, with a relatively high yield per unit area. This year's yield per unit area reached 200 jin per mu, an increase of 33% compared to last year.
