A Letter from the Urals

    Zhang Yanzhi is reading a letter from the Soviet Urals: "…I have been re-elected as the chairman of the street committee for five years, and I always want to do a better job. Please, as the director of the residents' committee, write to tell me how you are working in the residential area? Please be my friend. Although we are far apart—you are in China, and we are in the Urals—for our common cause, our friendship will surely be consolidated and intimate." …The letter was written by Pavnovich, the chairman of a street committee in a city in Molotov Oblast, Soviet Union. He became interested in the work of the Xiaotianshuijing Residents’ Committee introduced in the March issue of "People's Pictorial," so he wrote to the People's Pictorial Office, requesting to make friends with Zhang Yanzhi, the director of this residents' committee, and exchange experience in street work. The letter also described in detail the situation of their street work.
    Zhang Yanzhi was surprised and delighted after reading the letter: "Unexpected! An ordinary housewife, doing some ordinary daily work, has attracted the attention of Soviet friends. Our work is far behind what our Soviet friends are doing, and the tone in the letter is so polite… …" Her daughter said, "Mom, great, you have a Soviet friend now, write back!" Zhang Yanzhi decided to take a day when things are not too busy in the near future to write a detailed reply to her Soviet friend.

    乌拉尔的来信
    张延祉正在读着一封来自苏联乌拉尔的来信：“……我已经连任街道委员会主席五年，总还想把工作做得更好一些，请您，居民委员会主任，写信告诉我，您是怎样在居民区进行工作的？请和我做朋友。尽管我们相距很远——您在中国，我们在乌拉尔，但为了我们共同的事业，我们的友谊一定会巩固而亲密的。”……信是苏联莫洛托夫省一个城的街道委员会主席巴夫诺维奇写来的。他对今年三月号“人民画报”上介绍小甜水井居民委员会的工作发生了兴趣，就写信给人民画报社，要求和这个居民委员会主任张延祉交个朋友，交流街道工作的经验，信上还详细写了他们进行街道工作的情形。
    张延祉读完信又惊又喜：“意想不到啊！一个普通的家庭妇女，做些普通的日常工作，却引起了苏联友人的注意，我们的工作比起苏联朋友所做的还差得远哩，而信里的口气是那样客气………”她的女儿说：“妈妈，好啦，你有个苏联朋友啦，写回信吧！”张延祉决定在最近抽一个事情不多的日子，详细给苏联友人写回信。
