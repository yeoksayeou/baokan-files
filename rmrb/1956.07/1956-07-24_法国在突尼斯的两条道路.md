    France's Two Paths in Tunisia
    By Yuan Xianlu

    The negotiations between France and Tunisia were interrupted on July 13. The delegations of the two countries, led by French Prime Minister Mollet and Tunisian Prime Minister Bourguiba, began negotiations in Paris on June 26 to discuss the relations between the two countries after Tunisia's independence. The negotiations could not continue because France insisted on stationing troops in Tunisia.

    As early as May 1, Tunisian Prime Minister Bourguiba clearly announced Tunisia's position in negotiations with France. He said that since the signing of the Franco-Tunisian agreement on March 20, Tunisian independence has become a fact. The negotiations between Tunisia and France must be conducted between two completely independent countries speaking on an equal footing.

    However, the French government did not show sufficient respect for Tunisia's equal status and desire for independence in the negotiations. It insisted that the Tunisian government agree to allow France to maintain the Bizerte naval base in northern Tunisia and its troops on Tunisian territory. It is said that "Western strategic defense" and "defending Algeria" require France to do so. French Foreign Minister Pineau even said: "There is no question of French troops withdrawing from Morocco and Tunisia." Because, "The presence of French troops there does not contradict the independence of these two new countries. Indeed, it even strengthens their international position."

    The Tunisian delegation sternly refuted this argument of the French government and resolutely demanded that France withdraw its troops from Tunisia. Tunisian Prime Minister Bourguiba rightly said: "Any occupation of Tunisia by foreign armed forces is a violation of Tunisian sovereignty and a form of enslavement." "We fought against colonialism, we gained independence, not to agree today to a foreign army occupying our country for a long time or even indefinitely. Moreover, we remember that colonialism took root in our country because of the occupation of Bizerte." He pointed out that for Tunisia, the purpose of the current negotiations between the two countries is only to determine the manner in which French troops withdraw from Tunisian territory.

    Because the French government refused to consider the legitimate demands of the Tunisian people to withdraw foreign occupying forces and restore national sovereignty and territorial integrity, Prime Minister Bourguiba returned home on July 7. The Tunisian delegation, which remained in Paris to continue negotiations with France, was also forced to make the decision to interrupt the negotiations and left Paris on the 17th. How the relationship between the two countries will develop in the future depends on what attitude the French government takes.

    According to Agence France-Presse, after the interruption of the negotiations, French "well-informed sources" said, "It was clear from the beginning that the negotiations would take a long time. At the same time, Tunisia will maintain the status quo based on the 1955 Franco-Tunisian agreement." It is known that in the 1955 Franco-Tunisian agreement, the French government used the method of granting Tunisia "internal autonomy" while determining the "principle of co-management" to continue to place Tunisia's defense and diplomacy under its control. Therefore, the above passage revealed by Agence France-Presse sounds like a threat to the Tunisian people: as long as Tunisia refuses to allow France to continue stationing troops, the French government will delay the realization of Tunisian independence for a long time.

    If the French government really has this intention, it will inevitably repeat the subjective mistake. The Tunisian people did not give up their struggle for independence under decades of armed repression. Would they be intimidated by this threat? Prime Minister Bourguiba warned in a radio address on July 14 that if France insisted on its unreasonable demands, the Tunisian people "will resume the struggle to restore the integrity of our sovereignty." This is precisely the will of the entire Tunisian people. On July 17, the Tunisian Constituent Assembly unanimously passed a resolution supporting the government's position. Obviously, if the French government continues to follow this path, it will not bring any benefits to France.

    There is also another path, a path that conforms to the wishes of the Tunisian people and the interests of France. This path is that France withdraws its troops stationed in Tunisia, resolutely abides by the principle of respecting Tunisia's independence and sovereignty, and resumes negotiations with Tunisia on the basis of mutual equality. Only in this way can France retain the legitimate interests it has acquired in Tunisia due to long-term historical ties, and develop new political and economic ties with Tunisia on an equal and mutually beneficial basis.

    Wise French politicians will choose the latter path rather than the former.

    法国在突尼斯的两条道路
    袁先禄
    法国和突尼斯的谈判已经在七月十三日中断了。在法国总理摩勒和突尼斯首相布尔吉巴率领下的两国代表团，六月二十六日在巴黎开始了这次谈判，讨论突尼斯独立后两国的关系问题。由于法国坚持要在突尼斯驻扎军队，就使得谈判无法继续进行。
    早在五月一日，突尼斯首相布尔吉巴就明确地宣布了突尼斯在同法国进行谈判时所将采取的立场。他说：从三月二十日签订了法突协定之日起，突尼斯的独立已经成为一个事实。突尼斯同法国的谈判必须是在两个完全独立的、以平等身份讲话的国家之间所进行的谈判。
    但是，法国政府在谈判中并没有表现出足够尊重突尼斯的平等地位和独立愿望。它硬要突尼斯政府同意让法国保持在突尼斯北部比塞大的海军基地和在突尼斯领土上的驻军。据说，“西方战略防务”和“保卫阿尔及利亚”都需要法国这样做。法国外交部长比诺甚至说：“不存在法国军队从摩洛哥和突尼斯撤退的问题”。因为，“法国军队驻在那里同这两个新国家的独立并不矛盾。的确，它甚至加强了它们的国际地位”。
    突尼斯代表团严正地驳斥了法国政府的这种论调，坚决要求法国撤出在突尼斯的军队。突尼斯首相布尔吉巴说得好：“外国武装部队对突尼斯的任何占领都是对突尼斯主权的侵犯，是一种奴役的形式。”“我们为反对殖民主义而斗争，我们获得了独立，不是为了到今天同意一支外国军队长期甚至无限期地占领我们的国家。况且我们还记得，由于占领了比塞大，殖民主义才在我国扎了根。”他指出：对于突尼斯来说，目前两国谈判的目的只在于确定法国军队从突尼斯领土撤退的方式。
    由于法国政府拒绝考虑突尼斯人民要求撤退外国占领军、恢复国家主权完整的正当要求，布尔吉巴首相已经在七月七日回国。留在巴黎继续同法国谈判的突尼斯代表团也被迫作出了中断谈判的决定，在十七日离开了巴黎。今后两国之间的关系将怎样发展，现在要看法国政府采取什么态度了。
    据法新社报道，在谈判中断以后，法国的“消息灵通人士”说，“从一开始就可以明显地看出，谈判将需要很长的时间。同时，突尼斯将维持以1955年法国—突尼斯协定为基础的现状。”人们知道，法国政府在1955年的法突协定中，曾经用给予突尼斯“内政自治权”同时又确定“共管原则”的办法，把突尼斯的国防和外交继续放在自己的控制下。因此，法新社所透露的上面这段话听起来很像是对突尼斯人民的一种威胁：只要突尼斯拒绝让法国继续驻扎军队，法国政府就要把实现突尼斯独立的问题长期拖延下去。
    如果法国政府确有这种打算，那就不免重犯主观的毛病。突尼斯人民在几十年的武力镇压下没有放弃争取独立的斗争，难道他们还会被这种威胁所吓倒？布尔吉巴首相在七月十四日的广播演说中已经提出了警告：如果法国坚持它的无理要求，突尼斯人民“将为了恢复我们主权的完整而重新进行斗争。”这正是突尼斯全体人民的意志。七月十七日突尼斯立宪议会就一致通过决议，支持政府这种立场。显然，要是法国政府继续沿这条道路走下去，是不会给法国带来任何好处的。
    另外还有着一条道路，一条既符合突尼斯人民愿望、也符合法国利益的道路。这条道路就是，法国撤退在突尼斯的驻军，坚决遵守尊重突尼斯的独立和主权的原则，在互相平等的地位上恢复同突尼斯的谈判。只有这样，法国才能够保留在突尼斯由于长期历史联系而产生的正当利益，并且同突尼斯发展新的平等互利的政治、经济联系。
    明智的法国政治家将会选择后一种而不是前一种道路。
