    Publicly-Run, Government-Assisted Kindergartens
    According to the New China News Agency, now, walking through many worker residential areas in Anshan City, one can often see groups of children surrounding nannies in kindergartens listening to stories or playing games. The workers' houses are quiet, night shift workers are resting, and mothers are studying or taking care of household chores. This is the new scene after the development of publicly-run, government-assisted kindergartens.
    According to the recent statistics from the Anshan City Democratic Women's Federation, there are now more than five thousand children aged four to seven living in forty-two kindergartens, of which twenty-three were newly established in the past one or two months.
    Publicly-run, government-assisted kindergartens have overcome many difficulties in their establishment. The families of workers at the Chemical Industry General Plant initially established open-air kindergartens. Later, they received 3,000 yuan in construction funds from the factory. The mothers temporarily acted as construction workers, and some workers with carpentry and masonry skills also helped out after work, working together to build a simple kindergarten. The family members who serve as childcare workers often go to other kindergartens to learn the basic knowledge of childcare work. They also mobilized elementary school students to teach the children to sing and play games. Now, this kindergarten has accommodated 508 children, accounting for 82.7% of all school-age children in the Chemical Industry General Plant family residential area of Youhao Street.

    民办公助的幼儿园
    据新华社讯　现在，走到鞍山市的许多职工住宅区里，常常可以见到一群群孩子在幼儿园里围着阿姨听故事或做游戏，工人的屋子里静悄悄地，夜班工人在休息，妈妈们在学习或料理家务。这是民办公助幼儿园发展以后的新景象。
    据鞍山市民主妇女联合会最近的统计，现在全市已经有五千多个四岁到七岁的儿童生活在四十二个幼儿园中，其中有二十三个是在最近一、两个月内新成立的。
    民办公助的幼儿园在建立中克服了很多困难。化工总厂的工人家属们，开始成立的是露天幼儿园，以后她们在工厂中领到了三千元建筑费，妈妈们就临时充当了建筑工人，一些有木工、瓦工技术的工人下班后也来帮忙，一齐动手盖了一座简易的幼儿园。担任教养员的家属经常到别的幼儿园去学习教养工作的基本知识，她们还发动小学生教孩子们唱歌、作游戏。现在这个幼儿园已经收容了508个儿童，占友好街化工总厂家属住宅区全部适龄儿童的82.7％。
