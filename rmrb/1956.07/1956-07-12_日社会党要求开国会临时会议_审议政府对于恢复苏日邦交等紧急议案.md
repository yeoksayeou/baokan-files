    Xinhua News Agency, 11th Dispatch from Tokyo: The Japanese Socialist Party decided today to demand the convocation of an extraordinary session of the Diet to deliberate on the Japanese government's policies regarding the restoration of diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union and the issue of the United States expanding its requisition of land on Okinawa Island, among other urgent matters.
    The Socialist Party dispatched representatives to the speakers of both the House of Councillors and the House of Representatives this afternoon to complete the procedures for requesting the convocation of an extraordinary Diet session.
    The Socialist Party pointed out that, as a result of the House of Councillors election, the composition of the House of Councillors has changed, and in order to deliberate on various urgent proposals, it is necessary to convene an extraordinary Diet session in late July.
    Yesterday, the chairman of the Japanese Socialist Party, Mosaburo Suzuki, made a statement to reporters, demanding the immediate dissolution of the House of Representatives in accordance with the will of the Japanese people.
