Readers' Opinions on the Hundred Schools of Thought Contending

    Our Hope
    I am a student. At a time when the academic circles across the country are enthusiastically discussing the "Hundred Schools of Thought Contending" policy, I would like to raise the following hopes.
    First, I feel that although there was no "Hundred Schools of Thought Contending" in the past, there were already a few schools contending, but in class we can only hear "one school dominating." Teachers only talk about one theory and don't mention the different theories of various schools. I think this is not enough. For example, when we study Marxist-Leninist theory of nationalities, we connect it with the formation of the Han nationality in our country. Teachers only talk about one theory. In fact, historians such as Fan Wenlan and Lü Zhenyu have different opinions on this issue. Also, regarding the periodization of ancient Chinese history, there are several different opinions in the historical circles, but teachers only talk about one theory. I think that after the "Hundred Schools of Thought Contending" policy is implemented, there must be various different views on many academic issues. We hope that in the future, higher education teaching can appropriately introduce various different opinions in the academic circles. This can cultivate our research interest and improve our independent thinking ability.
    Secondly, due to the varying degrees of dogmatism and scholasticism in our learning, we lack the habit of specific analysis and independent thinking towards books and papers from foreign countries, and just swallow them whole. For example, we regard "Dialectical Materialism" edited by the Soviet Alexandrov as a reader without shortcomings. In fact, the Soviet academic circles have also pointed out many errors and shortcomings in this work. If teachers can introduce the advantages and disadvantages of the readings to us, it will undoubtedly be of great help to our extracurricular reading and research. This can also change our habit of worshiping authority and not daring to doubt.
    Furthermore, our connection between theoretical learning and current reality is still infrequent. For example, we know very little about the criticism of Hu Shi's and Liang Shuming's thoughts. We very much hope that the ideological criticism work in higher education teaching and academics can be further linked, so that our ideological understanding can be further improved in the struggle between materialism and idealism.

    Different Views Can Be Presented in Class
    On June 26th, the Chinese Department of our college organized a discussion on "Letting a Hundred Flowers Bloom, Letting a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend." During the discussion, I argued that in higher education teaching, we should oppose frivolous nonsense, but if a teacher does have unique insights that cannot be agreed upon even after discussion by the teaching and research group, then he can still present the opinions of the teaching and research group and his personal opinions in class, allowing students to study and discuss them. I believe that in higher education, students already have a certain ability to criticize, and this is perfectly acceptable. However, some comrades opposed my opinion.

    Should We Draw Circles?
    Some people believe that the Hundred Schools of Thought Contending should have conditions, and that condition is that it can only be within the circle of Marxism-Leninism; anything that conflicts with Marxism-Leninism should not be allowed to contend.
    I am a firm believer in Marxism, but I disagree with this view. Because if we do this, the research and discussion of academic thoughts will still not unfold freely. I think that academic debates can be debates on different understandings of certain issues under the principles of Marxism, or they can be debates that are sharply opposed to Marxism. In our society, both types of debates should be allowed to exist. Only when there is something wrong with idealism can the correctness of materialism be shown. If we can only read Marxist works in our society and cannot read idealistic works, then people will not only fail to deeply understand the errors of idealism, but they will also have a one-sided and superficial understanding of Marxism, and will not be able to talk about true knowledge and deep understanding.
    In the past, I worked in a Korean prisoner-of-war camp. In the library of the POW camp, there were Marxist works, as well as works by Adam Smith, Ricardo, and others, and the POWs were free to choose what to read. Many POWs had frankly said that they wanted to refute Marxism. They nitpicked every word and sentence when reading Marxist works, but the result was not that they refuted Marxism, but that they recognized the correctness and greatness of Marxist doctrines.
    Some comrades believe that if idealistic doctrines are allowed to spread, they will poison society and hinder socialist construction. Although this comes from good intentions, it is somewhat of an overestimation. Since liberation, the Chinese people have made unprecedented improvements in politics, ideology, and culture. We should trust the wisdom of the masses and believe that the masses can identify and choose the truth, and there is no need to be afraid of the harm of idealistic "heresies."
    Some people say that the Hundred Schools of Thought Contending can only be beneficial to socialist construction, and if it is not beneficial, it should not be allowed to contend indiscriminately. The motivation of those who put forward this proposition is certainly good, but this will have side effects and will hinder the enthusiasm for the Hundred Schools of Thought Contending. Because someone always feels that his theory is correct before contending, and before his proposition is put to discussion and even tested by practice, it is often difficult to determine the correctness of his theory and what kind of impact it will have on society. If at this time it is considered that it is not beneficial to socialist construction and he is not allowed to contend, it is unreasonable. The Hundred Schools of Thought Contending is precisely to clarify what is right and wrong, and to clarify what are the propositions that are beneficial to the country and the people. Those things that are not beneficial to the country and the people and not beneficial to socialist construction will naturally be eliminated and revised; those things that are beneficial to the country and the people and beneficial to socialist construction will inevitably be preserved, absorbed, and developed. Therefore, allowing the "Hundred Schools of Thought Contending" of various different opinions in academics is bound to be beneficial to my country's socialist construction.

### 读者对百家争鸣的意见

    读者对百家争鸣的意见
    我们的希望
    我是一个学生。正当全国学术界热烈讨论“百家争鸣”方针的时候，我愿意提出以下几点希望。
    首先，我觉得过去虽没有百家争鸣，但已有几家争鸣，而我们在课堂上却只能听到“一家独鸣”，教师只讲一种说法，不讲各家不同的说法，我以为这是不够的。比方说，我们学习马克思列宁主义民族理论时，联系了我国汉民族形成问题，教师只讲了一种说法，其实，关于这个问题，范文澜和吕振羽等史学家都有不同的意见。又如，关于中国古代史分期问题，史学界也有几种不同的意见，但教师也只讲了一种说法。我想，“百家争鸣”方针贯彻后，好多学术问题必有各种不同的看法，我们希望今后在高等学校教学中能适当介绍学术界各种不同的意见。这可以培养我们的钻研兴趣，提高我们的独立思考能力。
    其次，由于我们在学习上存在着不同程度的教条主义和学究作风，对待来自外国的书籍、论文，缺乏具体分析、独立思考的习惯，只是囫囵吞枣。比如，我们把苏联阿历山大罗夫主编的“辩证唯物主义”看成没有缺点的读本，其实，对这本著作，苏联学术界也曾指出了不少错误和缺点。教师如能为我们介绍介绍读物的优缺点，对我们的课外阅读和研究无疑有很大的帮助，这样也可改变我们崇拜权威，不敢怀疑的习惯。
    又次，我们在理论学习中联系当前实际还很不经常，如对胡适、梁漱溟思想的批判，我们就知道得很少。我们很希望高等学校教学和学术上的思想批判工作能进一步联系起来，使我们的思想认识能在唯物主义和唯心主义的斗争中得到更多的提高。
            华中师范学院　胡耀池课堂上可讲不同的见解
      六月二十六日我院中文系、科组织了一次关于“百花齐放，百家争鸣”的讨论。在讨论中，我认为在高等学校教学中，我们要反对不严肃的胡扯，但如某一教师确有独到的见解虽经教研组讨论后而不能一致，那么他仍可以在课堂上把教研组的意见和他个人的见解提出来，让同学们去研究讨论。我认为在高等学校中，学生已有一定的批判能力，这样做是完全可以的。但是，有些同志反对我的意见。

    该不该划圈子？
    有人认为百家争鸣应有条件，这个条件就是只能在马克思列宁主义的圈子以内；一切和马克思列宁主义抵触的东西，都不应该让他们鸣。
    我是笃信马克思主义的，但我不同意这种看法。因为这样做的结果，学术思想的研究讨论，还是不会自由展开的。我想学术思想上的争论，可以是在马克思主义原则下的对某些问题的不同认识的争论，也可以是和马克思主义针锋相对的争论。在我们的社会里，这两种类型的争论都应该容许其存在。有唯心主义的不对，才显示出唯物主义的正确。如果在我们的社会里只能读到马克思主义的著作，而不能读到唯心主义的著作，那么，人们不但不能深刻认识唯心主义的错误，就是对马克思主义也会理解得片面、肤浅、谈不上真知深解。
    过去我曾在朝鲜战俘营工作过。在战俘营的图书馆里，有马克思主义的著作，也有亚当斯密、李嘉图等人的著作，战俘们可以自由选读。许多战俘曾经坦白地说要驳倒马克思主义，他们在阅读马克思主义著作时逐字逐句地挑剔，但结果不是他们驳倒了马克思主义，而是他们承认了马克思主义学说的正确和伟大。
    有些同志认为如果容许唯心主义学说流传，将会遗毒社会，妨害社会主义建设。这虽是出于好心，但未免是一种过虑。解放后我国人民在政治上、思想上、文化上都有了空前的提高，我们应该相信人民群众的智慧，相信人民群众能够识别和选真理，完全不必害怕唯心主义的“异端邪说”的祸害。
    有人说，百家争鸣只能对社会主义建设有利，如果不利就不许乱鸣。提出这种主张者的动机，当然是好的，可是这一条会产生副作用，会妨碍百家的争鸣积极性。因为某人在争鸣以前总觉得他的理论是正确的，而当他的主张未付之讨论以至经过实践检验之前，往往很难确定他的理论的正误和对社会将起何种影响，如在这时候就认为它对社会主义建设无利而不让他争鸣，是不合理的。百家争鸣正是为了弄清孰是孰非，弄清什么是利于国家和人民的主张。那些不利于国家和人民，不利于社会主义建设的东西，就自然会被淘汰，被修正；那些有利于国家和人民，有利于社会主义建设的东西，必将被保存、吸收和发展起来。因此，允许学术上各种不同意见的“百家争鸣”，是必然有利于我国社会主义建设的。
