Hunan Xikuangshan Plans to Eliminate Silicosis within Five Years

    According to the New Hunan Daily, the Xikuangshan Mining Bureau in Hunan Province has made great progress in preventing and treating silicosis. The bureau is taking further measures to eliminate silicosis within five years.

    In non-ferrous metal mines, coal mines, and mineral powder manufacturing factories, workers are prone to silicosis if they inhale excessive amounts of silica dust and particles in the air during the mining and manufacturing of mineral powder. Before liberation, many people in the Xikuangshan antimony mine suffered from silicosis, with an average of five people dying from it every day. After liberation, the Party and the government were very concerned about the silicosis problem among workers. In 1950, relevant central departments sent an investigation team to conduct research on the silicosis problem in the Xikuangshan antimony mine. Since 1952, the mine has used pneumatic drills instead of single-hand hammers for mining. To prevent silica dust from entering workers' lungs, the mine has vigorously promoted methods such as "wet rock drilling," along with other measures to prevent silicosis. In the past year or so, only a very few new cases have been added. The average concentration of silica dust in the tunnels, measured in April last year, was 365 particles per cubic centimeter of air. The measurement on June 27 this year showed that it had dropped to 168 particles. Currently, the mine is actively implementing the State Council's "Decision on Preventing Silica Dust Hazards in Factories and Mines," has established a special organization for the prevention and treatment of silicosis, and has formulated detailed plans to resolutely eliminate silicosis completely within five years.

    湖南锡矿山计划五年内消灭矽肺病
    据新湖南报讯　湖南锡矿山矿务局防治矽肺病的工作已经取得很大成绩。这个局正在进一步采取措施，计划在五年内消灭矽肺病。
    有色金属矿、煤矿以及矿粉制造工厂，在采矿和制造矿粉的过程中，如果空气里含矽尘、粉粒过多，被工人吸到肺里，就会患矽肺病。在解放以前，锡矿山锑矿患矽肺病的人很多，每天平均有五个人因患矽肺病死亡。解放以后，党和政府非常关心职工的矽肺病问题。在1950年，中央有关部门就派来考察团，对锡矿山锑矿的矽肺病问题进行了调查研究。1952年开始，矿山用风钻代替单手锤开采，为了防止矽尘飞扬侵入工人肺部，全矿还大力推行了“湿式锉岩”等方法，加上其它防止矽肺病的措施，最近一年多来新增加的病人只是极个别的。窿道内矽尘平均浓度，去年四月测定为每立方公分空气中含矽尘365颗，今年六月二十七日的测定，降到168颗。现在，矿山正在积极贯彻执行国务院“关于防止厂矿企业中矽尘危害的决定”，成立了防治矽肺病的专门机构，订出了详细的规划，坚决要在五年内全部消灭矽肺病。
