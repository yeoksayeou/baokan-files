    Houses that Leak More After Repairs
    “Better not to repair, repairs make it worse,
    Outside the rain is heavy, inside it roars,
    Outside it doesn't rain, inside it drips.”
    This is a doggerel “praising” the Shenyang Municipal Real Estate Bureau Engineering Company for repairing houses. This company recently repaired some houses in the urban area, and the repairs were immediately put to the test when a torrential rain came. At this time, the newly repaired house of the South Yijing Road Grain Supply Station originally only leaked in three places, but now it leaks in eight. Under the "test," the house at No. 1 Haicheng Hutong in Beiguan District was almost completely destroyed. People had to put up rain tarpaulins on their beds to avoid the rain. As for how many doors cannot be opened, windows cannot be closed, floors are uneven, and walls are uneven after the repairs by this company, it is impossible to calculate. According to a conservative estimate by an engineer of the company, it accounts for at least more than half.
    The nature of repair belongs to construction. The Shenyang Municipal Real Estate Bureau Engineering Company is also a construction force of our country. However, the "achievements" created by this construction force in repairing houses make it impossible to associate it with words like construction. This is really worth studying. I wonder what the agency leading this engineering company thinks?

### 越修越漏的房子

    越修越漏的房子
    “不修则罢，越修越大，
    外面雨大，屋内哗哗，
    外面不下，屋内滴哒”
    这是人们“歌颂”沈阳市房地产局工程公司修理房子的打油诗，该公司最近修理了市区一部分房子，修完之后，立即受到了考验，下起倾盆大雨来了。这时，南一经路粮食供应站新修的房子原来只漏三处，这回漏成八处。北关区海城胡同一号的住房在“考验”之下，几乎变得体无完肤，人们只好在床上用油布搭起防雨棚来避雨。至于经过这个公司的修理，有多少门开不开，窗关不上，地板起伏，墙面凹凸，更不能计算了，据该公司的一个工程师保守的估计，起码也占一半以上。
    修理的性质，本来属于建设，沈阳市房地产局工程公司也是我们国家的一支建设力量。可是这支建设力量在修理房屋当中创造的“业绩”竟使人无法和建设这类字眼联系起来，这实在是值得加以研究的。不知道领导这个工程公司的机关以为如何？
