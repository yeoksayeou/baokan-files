Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 12th -- The Angara River, the Soviet Union's richest in water resources, was dammed for the first time on July 10th. This is a major victory for the workers building the Irkutsk Hydropower Station. From now on, the construction of the hydropower station will proceed on an even larger scale. It is expected that this hydropower station, which will generate twice as much electricity as the Dnieper Hydropower Station, will begin generating electricity this year.

The flow rate of the Angara River is more than three meters per second, but it only took one and a half days to dam the turbulent Angara River. It took only eighteen hours to build a floating bridge for throwing stones and concrete blocks on the Angara River, while it took ten days to build the floating bridge for the Kuibyshev Hydropower Station. These outstanding achievements were created by the selfless labor of the construction workers of the Irkutsk Hydropower Station.

When the Angara River was dammed, a total of 3,500 huge concrete blocks, 12,000 tons of stones, and 35,000 tons of earth were dumped.

    苏联第一次拦断安加拉河
    新华社莫斯科12日电　苏联水力资源最丰富的安加拉河，七月十日第一次被拦断了。这是修建伊尔库次克水电站的工人的一大胜利。从此以后，水电站的建设工程将以更大的规模进行。预计，这座发电量比第聂伯水电站大一倍的水电站，将在今年开始发电。
    安加拉河水的流速是每秒三公尺多，但是，拦断汹涌的安加拉河只化了一天半的时间。在安加拉河上架设抛投石块和混凝土块的浮桥，只用了十八个小时，而架设古比雪夫水电站的浮桥却用了十天的时间。这些优异的成就，是伊尔库次克水电站建筑工人用忘我的劳动创造出来的。
    拦断安加拉河的时候，共投下了三千五百块巨大的混凝土块、一万二千吨石块和三万五千吨泥土。
