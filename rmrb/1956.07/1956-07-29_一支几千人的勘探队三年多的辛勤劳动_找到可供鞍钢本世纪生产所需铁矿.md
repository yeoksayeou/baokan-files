Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, July 28th (Xinhua reporter Li Chen): A geological team of several thousand people from the Anshan Geological Exploration Company has, in the first three and a half years of the First Five-Year Plan, already discovered iron ore in the mountains near Anshan that can meet Anshan Iron and Steel's production needs for this century.

    A person in charge of the Anshan Geological Exploration Company told the reporter: This vanguard of the black metallurgical industry, in three and a half years of exploration in the mountains and fields of Gongchangling, Dagushan, Dong Anshan, Cherry Orchard, Waitoushan, Qidaogou and other places, has explored several hundred million tons more iron ore than planned. If calculated according to the planned steel production level of Anshan Iron and Steel in 1962, the proven reserves of iron ore in these places can supply Anshan Iron and Steel for more than forty years.

    The person in charge also told the reporter: The exploration team currently active in the Duokouyu area in the northwest of Gongchangling recently discovered new iron ore. In the core taken from just one borehole, they found more than 40 meters of rich iron ore. After finding new iron ore in these areas that were previously considered to have little hope, in the past few days, the Gongchangling area exploration team has been studying the overall exploration plan. They plan to explore several hundred million tons more iron ore than currently known in the entire Gongchangling area. The exploration teams on the east and west Anshan Mountains, more than ten miles south of Anshan, also plan to explore about twice as much iron ore as is currently known in the next few years.

    一支几千人的勘探队三年多的辛勤劳动
    找到可供鞍钢本世纪生产所需铁矿
    新华社鞍山28日电　新华社记者李沉报道：鞍山地质勘探公司的一支几千人的勘探队，在第一个五年计划的前三年半中，已经在鞍山附近的群山中找到了可以满足鞍钢在本世纪内生产所需要的铁矿。
    鞍山地质勘探公司的一位负责人告诉记者：这支黑色冶金工业的尖兵，三年半中在弓长岭、大孤山、东鞍山、樱桃园、歪头山、七道沟等地的山野里，勘探出来的铁矿比计划多几亿吨。如果按照现在规划的鞍钢1962年的钢铁生产水平来计算，这些地方已经查明的铁矿的埋藏量，就可以供鞍钢使用四十多年。
    这位负责人还告诉记者：目前正在弓长岭西北区多口峪一带活动的勘探队，前些日子找到了新的铁矿，仅从一个钻孔采取出来的岩芯中，就发现有四十多公尺厚的富铁矿。在这些过去认为没有多大希望的地方找到新铁矿以后，这几天，弓长岭区的勘探队已经在研究勘探的总体规划，他们计划在整个弓长岭地区勘探出比现在多几亿吨的铁矿。在鞍山南边十多里的东、西鞍山上的勘探队，也计划在最近几年内勘探出比目前多两倍左右的铁矿。
