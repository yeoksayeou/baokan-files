The Ailments of the North Atlantic Group
Jiang Ruixi

I

The North Atlantic military group, established seven years ago, is now facing the question of whether it can survive. Many member states have raised serious questions about the nature, policy, and future of this group. They are demanding that the focus of the Atlantic group be shifted to developing "non-military cooperation." The North Atlantic Group Council meeting held in Paris in early May took this issue as a central point of discussion.

Why are there now so many voices that are incompatible with the basic nature of this group? What do these voices mean? These are some interesting questions.

II

In recent years, the torrent of easing international tensions has broken through the "Cold War" dam built by the United States, pushing the world in the direction of peace and international cooperation. The rise and fall of war and peace forces have undergone fundamental changes. Even the upper echelons of the ruling groups in Western countries cannot but make a sober assessment. For them, the bankruptcy of the atomic monopoly, which was the main basis of the United States' "policy of strength," is an important issue to consider.

The forces of peace possess the material means to prevent war. Whoever wants to start a war can only bring failure and destruction to themselves and their followers. This is especially true for countries like the North Atlantic Group, which have small areas and concentrated industries and populations. Therefore, peaceful coexistence is the only way to go. British Prime Minister Eden recently said that "conflict between great powers is unimaginable." He believes that under the current "balance" created by hydrogen bombs, only a madman would plan to conquer the world by force. He indicated that Britain is considering revising its "defense" policy based on the "changed situation caused by the hydrogen bomb itself." Former Labor Prime Minister Attlee more bluntly stated the essence of the problem, saying: "I am fully convinced that if only a few hydrogen bombs are dropped on this country, people will not consider how to fight, but how to enable a few people to survive." Therefore, "we must never allow a major war to happen." Even Churchill, who announced the start of the "Cold War" ten years ago in his famous Fulton speech, also advocated in his Aachen speech in May that "true European unity must have Russia's participation," and opposed using force to solve existing problems in Europe, because war would only bring "ashes and death." These remarks by the main political representatives of Britain, the main "partner" of the US Atlantic Group, prove the saying that many Western countries' political leaders have concluded that the entire "strategic concept" of the Atlantic Group is outdated.

Due to the joint efforts of peace-loving people of all countries, the principles of peaceful coexistence and the development of international cooperation have been affirmed and won more and more sympathy and support around the world. At the same time, the influence of socialist countries' peaceful diplomatic policies is expanding, and the propaganda about the "threat of communist aggression" is becoming less and less deceptive. The increasing development of international cultural and economic exchanges proves that such exchanges are not only possible but also very beneficial. In such a situation, military blocs and "positions of strength" policies make their planners increasingly isolated politically and morally. Last year's Geneva Four-Power Summit clearly rejected war as a means of resolving international disputes, and advocated the method of consultation in international affairs. The forces of war suffered a heavy blow. The fact that Dulles' so-called "brink of war" speech in January this year aroused angry condemnation at home and abroad proves the bankruptcy of the war policy with new force. Therefore, some Western newspapers pointed out with good reason that the "Cold War system" embodied by the Atlantic Group is gradually becoming a "dangerous" thing for the West. This is also something that Western countries' political leaders cannot but seriously consider.

III

With the deepening of the capitalist crisis, the conflicts of interest among the countries of the Atlantic Treaty have also intensified. The "New York Times" pointed out that the irreconcilable conflicts of interest between the member states have caused the "increasing pain" of the Atlantic Alliance. This is first manifested in the relationship between the United States and its "allies."

In the seven years since the establishment of the Atlantic Group, it has spent more than 360 billion US dollars on arms expansion and war preparations. This heavy burden has caused economic difficulties for various countries. Taking Britain as an example, since the implementation of the arms expansion plan in 1951, military spending has increased year by year, creating a serious threat of inflation. Even the government's prime minister and ministers cannot but publicly admit that this burden seriously depletes its resources, and Britain is no longer able to continue to bear it. It is now increasingly clear that the Atlantic arms expansion movement primarily guarantees the huge interests of US monopoly capital, while for its European allies, it means the depletion of financial resources and the weakening of their ability to compete with US capital.

Under the banner of "Western unity" and anti-Soviet and anti-communist, the United States' power has ruthlessly invaded the traditional markets and spheres of influence of its "allies." The United States' squeezing out of French interests in Indochina and its encroachment on British rights and interests in the Middle East are obvious examples. The recent approval by the British government of the purchase of the British Trinidad Oil Company by an American oil company is a new example of the penetration of American monopoly capital into Britain itself.

The penetration of American monopoly capital increasingly threatens the Atlantic "allies" of the United States, and it inevitably provokes increasingly fierce resistance. Recently, this contradiction has even been clearly expressed in the speeches of officials. British Prime Minister Eden recently said: Based on my judgment of the future, "the more direct threat to the survival of our country is not so much a world war as competition in export markets." A senior British official, in explaining Eden's remarks, emphasized a "cruel fact," namely, that Britain needs to deal with "the economic penetration of the United States, which is constantly eroding the interests of the Commonwealth." According to foreign news agencies, this is also one of the important issues being discussed at the ongoing Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference.

The "embargo" policy that undermines East-West trade is one of the most acute problems in the Atlantic policy that harms the interests of Western European countries. With the capitalist crisis of overproduction looming and market competition becoming increasingly fierce, Western European countries have deepened their economic difficulties due to being deprived of the vast sales market in the East. On this issue, Western European countries are increasingly feeling the pain.

IV

As a result of changes in the international situation, the increasing difficulties of the Atlantic Group countries themselves, and the development of contradictions between their respective interests, their policy differences have become more and more apparent.

This spring, French Foreign Minister Pineau, Prime Minister Mollet, and Italian President Gronchi publicly criticized the American approach of the Atlantic Group, which blindly emphasizes "military strength," believing that this approach is completely unable to adapt to the changed international situation. They also advocated peaceful coexistence between East and West and the elimination of the danger of war. This general policy trend of Western European countries is also reflected in the subsequent Anglo-Soviet talks and Franco-Soviet talks, as well as in the recent remarks of Eden, Pineau, and other political leaders.

Many countries in the Atlantic Group are now particularly emphasizing the "development of (the Atlantic Group's) non-military aspects" to adapt to the trend of "competitive coexistence." The raising of this issue first reflects the deepening of economic difficulties in these countries and the growing sentiment of dissatisfaction with the arms expansion policy. At the same time, it also reflects the desire of various countries to seek independent political and economic development, get rid of US control, and adapt to the new situation. The British "Spectator" magazine wrote: "Most North Atlantic countries cannot indefinitely endure the burden of a wartime foreign policy in a peacetime economy." It pointed out that if the Western alliance is to be "strengthened," the United States must "loosen its direct influence on its allies... Western Europe should be relieved of the heavy burden of expanding armaments, and should increasingly feel that it is a firm but fully reconciled wing of Western foreign policy." These arguments explain the background of these countries' raising the issue of "non-military cooperation."

V

Under pressure from all sides, the United States has recently expressed its agreement to consider the "development" of the North Atlantic Group. However, this posture of the United States, as Dulles himself admitted, is primarily out of strategic consideration to "prevent the division of the West." In fact, the United States intends to try its best to preserve the military structure of the Atlantic Group under the guise of empty talk about Atlantic "political and economic cooperation." The current practice of the US authorities is: on the one hand, preparing to increase the "interest" of Atlantic countries in military affairs by strengthening the supply of new weapons; on the other hand, expressing support for strengthening the Atlantic Group politically, which, according to Dulles' explanation, is to eliminate the "disunity" on "issues that shake the foundation of the Atlantic Group" in order to ensure the "consistency" of policies needed by the United States. As for the economic aspect, the United States fundamentally does not want to abandon the current practice of providing economic assistance through bilateral agreements to facilitate political goals, and therefore expresses extreme indifference to any suggestions regarding other forms of economic cooperation. Therefore, the Atlantic Treaty Council's May meeting this year argued a lot, and finally only decided to establish a "Three Wise Men" committee to study the issue of developing the "non-military aspects of cooperation" of the Atlantic Group. Since that Council meeting, Western officials and newspaper commentators have made many analyses, explaining that whether in the economic or political aspects, Atlantic countries, due to the fundamental contradiction of interests, "cooperation" is nothing but a castle in the air. It is pointed out that the countries participating in the Atlantic Treaty agreed seven years ago to "eliminate conflicts in economic policies" and implement political cooperation. In 1951, a committee was also specially established to study this aspect, but so far, no achievement has been made. Based on these facts, Westerners have made many pessimistic predictions about the future of the "Three-Person Committee" responsible for studying the development of the "non-military aspects" of this group.

VI

Obviously, all the window-dressing work cannot solve the profound crisis of this already decadent military group. The "failure" and "collapse" of the Atlantic Group, as Westerners talk about, stems from the fact that its existence is contrary to the trend of the times, it is a tool for planning wars and conducting the "Cold War," and it is incompatible with the interests of the nations of all countries and with the general trend of peaceful coexistence and international cooperation. The British magazine "New Statesman and Nation" said: "NATO is an anachronism, a clumsy palaeontology left over from the frozen years of the Cold War." This is not an exaggeration at all. It is conceivable what will happen if Washington's diplomats try to revive this ominous "palaeontology" in order to continue to pursue a "policy of strength" on its own.

    北大西洋集团的病症
    江瑞熙
    一
    七年前成立的北大西洋军事集团现在发生了能不能生存下去的问题。许多成员国对这个集团的性质、方针和前途提出了严重的疑问。它们要求把大西洋集团的重点转移到发展“非军事方面的合作”。五月上旬在巴黎举行的北大西洋集团理事会会议把这个问题当作讨论的一个中心。
    为什么现在会出现这许多同这个集团的基本性质不协调的呼声呢？这些呼声又意味着什么呢？这是一些令人感兴趣的问题。
    二
    近年来，缓和国际紧张局势的洪流冲破了美国所筑起的“冷战”堤坝，把世界推向和平和国际合作的方向。战争与和平力量的消长产生了根本的变化。连西方国家统治集团的上层人物也不能不加以清醒的估计。对于他们说来，作为美国“实力政策”主要依据的原子垄断的破产，是必须考虑的一个重要问题。
    和平力量拥有了制止战争的物质手段。谁要发动战争，就只能给自己及其追随者带来失败和毁灭。对于像北大西洋集团那些幅员不大，工业和人口集中的国家来说尤其如此。因此，和平共处是唯一可走的道路。英国首相艾登最近说，“大国之间的冲突是不可想像的”。他认为在目前氢弹造成的“均势”之下，只有疯子才会打算以武力来征服世界。他表示，英国正在根据“氢弹本身所引起的有了改变的情况”考虑修改它的“防御”政策。前工党首相艾德礼更为直率地说明了问题的实质，他说：“我完全相信，如果仅仅在这个国家投下少数几枚氢弹，那么人们就不会考虑怎样作战的问题，而是考虑怎样使少数人能够活下去的问题了。”因此，“我们决不能使大战发生”。甚至十年前在他出名的富尔敦演说中宣布“冷战”开始的丘吉尔，也在五月间的亚琛演说中主张“真正的欧洲统一必须有俄国参加”，并且反对用武力来解决欧洲现存的问题，因为战争将只有带来“灰烬和死亡”。美国大西洋集团的主要“伙伴”英国的主要政治代表的这些言论证明了这样一种说法：许多西方国家的政治领袖已经得出结论：大西洋集团的全部“战略观念”已经过时了。
    由于各国爱好和平人民的共同努力，和平共处和发展国际合作的原则在全世界得到了肯定，赢得了越来越多的同情和支持。同时，社会主义国家和平外交政策的影响日益扩大，关于“共产主义侵略威胁”的宣传愈来愈骗不了人。而国际文化经济的交流日益发展，证明这种交往不仅是可能的而且是非常有益的。在这样的形势下，军事集团和“实力地位”政策使得它的策划者在政治上、道义上越来越孤立。去年日内瓦四国首脑会议明确排斥以战争作为解决国际争端的手段，而主张在国际事务中采取协商的方法。战争势力遭到了沉重的打击。今年一月杜勒斯发表的所谓“战争边缘”演说引起国内外愤怒的谴责，这个事实以新的力量证明战争政策的破产。所以西方一些报刊不无道理地指出，大西洋集团所体现的“冷战制度”对西方来说渐渐变成一种“危险的”东西。这也是西方国家政治领袖们所不能不认真考虑的。
    三
    随着资本主义危机的加深，大西洋公约各国的利害冲突也尖锐起来。“纽约时报”指出，集团成员国之间不可调和的利害冲突造成了大西洋联盟的“日益加剧的痛苦”。这首先表现在美国和它的“盟国”的关系上。
    大西洋集团成立七年来，已经付出了三千六百多亿美元的巨大开支从事扩军备战，这种沉重的负担造成了各国经济的困难。以英国为例，自从1951年开始实行扩军计划以来，军费一年年增加，造成了严重的通货膨胀的威胁，连政府的首相和大臣们都不能不公开承认，这种负担严重地损耗它的资源，英国已经没有能力继续担负下去了。现在越来越清楚的是：大西洋扩军运动，首先是保证了美国垄断资本的庞大利益，而对于它的欧洲盟国来说，却意味着财源的损耗和同美国资本竞争的能力的削弱。
    在“西方团结”和反苏反共的招牌下，美国的势力毫无顾忌地侵入了“盟国”的传统市场和势力范围。美国在印度支那排挤法国的利益，在中东蚕食英国的权益，就是明显的例证，最近英国政府批准了美国石油公司购买英国特立尼达石油公司，就是美国垄断资本渗入英国本身的一个新的例子。
    美国垄断资本的渗入日益严重地威胁到美国的大西洋“盟国”，它也就不可避免地引起日益猛烈的抵抗。最近，这种矛盾甚至在官方人士的发言中也明显地表现出来。英国首相艾登最近说：根据我对未来的判断，“对于我们国家生存的更直接的威胁与其说是世界大战，倒不如说是出口市场上的竞争。”一个英国高级官员在解释艾登的谈话时强调指出了一个“残酷的事实”，这就是：英国需要对付“不断蚕食英联邦利益的美国的经济渗入”。据外国通讯社的消息透露，这也是正在举行的英联邦总理会议讨论的重要问题之一。
    破坏东西方贸易的“禁运”政策是大西洋政策中损害西欧国家利益的最尖锐的问题之一。在资本主义生产过剩危机日益迫近、市场竞争日益剧烈的情况下，西欧国家由于被剥夺了东方广大的销售市场而加深了经济困难。在这个问题上，西欧国家越来越感到切肤之痛。
    四
    国际局势的变化，和大西洋集团国家本身困难的增加以及它们相互之间利益矛盾的发展的结果，它们政策上的分歧也就愈来愈表面化了。
    今年春天，法国外长比诺、总理摩勒和意大利总统格隆基分别在公开发表的言论中批评大西洋集团一味强调“军事实力”的美国方针，认为这种方针已经完全不能适应变化了的国际局势。他们还主张实行东西方和平共处、消除战争的危险。西欧国家这种一般的政策趋向也反映在随后举行的英苏会谈和法苏会谈以及最近以来艾登、比诺以及其他政治领袖的言论中间。
    大西洋集团的许多国家现在特别强调“发展（大西洋集团的）非军事方面”以适应“竞争性共处”的趋势。这个问题的提出，首先反映出这些国家里经济困难的加深和对扩军政策不满的情绪的增长，同时也反映着各国谋求政治经济上的独立发展、摆脱美国控制、适应新的形势的愿望。英国“旁观者”周刊写道：“大多数北大西洋国家不能够在和平时期的经济中无限期地忍受一种战时外交政策的负担。”它指出，如果要“加强”西方联盟，美国就必须“放松它对盟国的直接的影响。……西欧应当从扩张军备的重担下解脱出来，并且应当日益感到自己是一个坚定但又充分和解的西方外交政策的前进中的一翼。”这些论点说明了这些国家提出“非军事合作”问题的背景。
    五
    在各方面的压力下，美国最近表示同意考虑“发展”北大西洋集团的问题。但是美国的这种姿态，正像杜勒斯自己所承认的，首先是出于要“防止西方的分裂”的策略考虑。实际上，美国打算在空谈大西洋“政治经济合作”的幌子下尽力把大西洋集团的军事机构保存下来。美国当局目前的做法是：一方面准备用加强供应新式武器的办法来提高大西洋国家在军事方面的“兴趣”；另一方面表示赞成从政治方面加强大西洋集团，这一点按照杜勒斯的解释，就是要消除在“动摇大西洋集团基础的问题”上的“不团结”现象，以保证美国所需要的政策“一致”。至于经济方面，美国根本不想放弃目前通过双边协定给予经济援助以便于达到政治目的的做法，因此对任何关于其他方式的经济合作的建议都表示极端冷淡。因此，大西洋公约理事会今年五月会议争论了一场，最后只是决定设立了一个“三贤人”委员会，来研究发展大西洋集团的“非军事方面的合作”的问题。自从那次理事会会议举行以来，西方官员和报刊评论员已经作了不少分析，说明不论是在经济方面还是在政治方面，大西洋国家由于根本利益的矛盾，“合作”不过是空中楼阁。人们指出，参加大西洋公约的国家七年前就商定要“消除经济政策中的冲突”和实行政治上的合作，1951年也专门设立过一个委员会来研究这方面的问题，但是到现在为止，没有得到丝毫的成就。西方人士根据这些事实，已经对负责研究发展这个集团“非军事方面”的作用的“三人委员会”的前途作出了许多悲观的预测。
    六
    显然，一切装饰门面的工作都解决不了这个已经腐朽的军事集团的深刻危机。西方人士所谈论的大西洋集团的“失败”和“崩溃”，其根源就在于：它的存在是违背时代潮流的，它是策划战争和进行“冷战”的工具，它是同各国民族的利益、同和平共处国际合作的总趋势不相容的。英国的“新政治家与民族”杂志说：“北大西洋公约组织是一种时代错误，是冷战的酷寒年月里遗留下来的一种笨拙的古生物。”这是一点也不过火的。华盛顿的外交家们企图使这个不吉利的“古生物”复活，以便依靠它来继续推行“实力”政策，其结果如何，是可想而知的。
