The struggle surrounding the Saar has not ended
		Yuan Xianlu

Since France and West Germany signed the Luxembourg Agreement on the Saar issue in June, officials from both countries have attempted to give the impression in their talks that the years of dispute have been eliminated and the path to cooperation has been opened. The Luxembourg Agreement stipulates a solution to the Saar issue: on January 1, 1957, the Saar will be formally politically integrated into West Germany, and economically integrated into West Germany by 1960. As compensation to France, West Germany agreed to allow France to continue mining the Warndt coal mine, subsidize the cost of building the Moselle Canal, and made some concessions on other issues. The communiqués issued by the two governments stated that the negotiations on the Saar issue were "very friendly" and that future relations between the two countries would "develop in close and trusting cooperation."

However, neither the information revealed about the negotiations nor the opinions of some newspapers after the meeting can confirm this deliberately optimistic argument. In fact, at the last minute of the talks, a crisis occurred, forcing West German Foreign Minister Brentano to rush to the French Embassy late at night to negotiate with the French. After the agreement was announced, some commentators in Paris pointed out uneasily that although France had obtained some concessions from West Germany that were of direct interest to certain industrialists, the dissolution of the French-Saar economic union would weaken France's economic and political position. West German news agencies reported that the plan to build the Moselle Canal in the agreement was opposed by the majority of West German industrialists.

The problem remains the deeply rooted contradiction between the Lorraine giants and the Ruhr giants.

The Saar was originally German territory, but its rich coal deposits have always attracted the strong interest of French industrial tycoons. After the First World War, France occupied the Saar under the Treaty of Versailles until 1935. After the Second World War, France, as one of the occupying powers of Germany, regained political and economic control of the Saar and incorporated its customs and currency into the French system. French monopoly capital vigorously developed the Saar's coal and steel industries, making this area of only two thousand square kilometers an increasingly important industrial base. It now produces 17 million tons of coal annually, almost one-third of France's coal production. The annual steel production is nearly three million tons, equivalent to one-quarter of France's steel production. By controlling the Saar, French monopoly capital can not only obtain huge profits, but also put itself in a relatively equal position in competition with West German monopoly capital. In addition, the Saar is also a huge market where France can sell 160 billion francs worth of industrial and agricultural products annually.

However, West German monopoly capital, which rapidly restored its economic strength and was ambitious after the war, strongly demanded the "recovery" of this industrial base. As a result, the Saar issue became increasingly acute and became a long-standing issue between France and West Germany.

In October 1954, in order to get France to sign the "Paris Agreements" that rearmed West Germany, the West German government and the French government signed an agreement to "Europeanize" the Saar. However, in October 1955, the Saar referendum rejected the "European Statute" against their will. In an election held last December, the pro-French parties failed again. The vast majority of Saar residents expressed their desire to return to the German nation. This forced France to agree to this demand.

Of course, French monopoly organizations were unwilling to easily give up their interests in the Saar. Therefore, the French government put forward many conditions in the negotiations. For example: the issue of building the Moselle Canal must be resolved at the same time as the Saar issue; building this canal would provide the French Lorraine steel trust with a cheap shipping route to the sea, thus increasing profits by 15 billion francs annually; requiring another 130 million tons of coal to be mined in the Warndt coal mine, the richest coal-bearing area in the Saar, by 1980; because this coal is urgently needed by French industry; requiring amendments to the provisions on representation in the "European Coal and Steel Community," because after the Saar is incorporated into West Germany, France's share of steel production in this community will fall to 22%, and it will lose the priority voting rights enjoyed by member states that control at least 25% of steel production.

There were many disputes between the two sides on these issues during the negotiations. Thus, starting in February of this year, the French and West German foreign ministers, Pinay and Brentano, and the undersecretaries, Faurre and Hallstein, along with many experts under their leadership, went from Paris to Bonn, and from Bonn to Paris, constantly bargaining, arguing, and threatening each other - all of this is the so-called "very friendly" content in the negotiation communiqué.

It was not until June 4 that French Prime Minister Mollet and West German Chancellor Adenauer held talks in Luxembourg. During this meeting, Adenauer made some concessions to France's economic demands in exchange for France's agreement to incorporate the Saar into West Germany as soon as possible. As a result, the two sides signed the Luxembourg Agreement mentioned above on June 5.

However, the compromise in Luxembourg did not and could not resolve the contradictions between the French and West German monopoly organizations. As can be seen from the information revealed by Western newspapers and news agencies, there are still many problems in formulating ways to implement this agreement.

Regarding the issue of building the Moselle Canal, which was the most contentious issue in the negotiations, although the West German government has agreed to the French plan and is willing to bear more than half of the construction costs, the date for the start of construction of the canal is still far away. It is difficult to imagine that the West German monopoly capital group would be generous enough to pay to improve the position of its French competitors. There are already reports that West German experts intend to propose some technical conditions to offset most of the benefits France would gain from using the canal. Moreover, since the canal will pass through Luxembourg, and the metallurgical and railway transportation industries of Luxembourg and Belgium, which have an economic alliance with it, are opposed to the construction of the canal. Therefore, West German monopoly organizations will also use this point to obstruct it. Adenauer publicly stated after the agreement was reached that the voices of Belgium and Luxembourg might be heard, saying that the Moselle Canal would also worsen their competitive position, and people must express their opinions on this issue after listening to their opinions.

On the issue of the Warndt coal mine, the agreement stipulates that France can still mine 66 million tons of coal by 1970. But the British "Economist" magazine pointed out that the Saar's other developed mines are about to be exhausted, and the Saar's coal mining enterprises will be forced to turn to Warndt more. The agreement cannot prevent the mining of Warndt coal on Saar territory, which will make it difficult for Lorraine coal enterprises to operate.

There were many other contentious issues that were not agreed upon in the talks. For example, the Röchling steel plant, the largest in the Saar with an annual steel production of 850,000 tons, agreed with France in April 1955 to have France acquire 50% of its shares. After the Saar statute was rejected, disputes arose between the two sides. In May of this year, French Deputy Foreign Minister Faure proposed to take this dispute to the International Court of Justice. However, this agreement did not mention whether the agreement to acquire shares in the Röchling plant in the past would continue to be implemented. In addition, the issue of currency exchange has no specific instructions in the agreement. The issue of representation in the "European Coal and Steel Community" remains to be discussed separately.

It can be seen from this that despite the Luxembourg meeting communiqué chanting "the highest spirit of European cooperation," the struggle between French and West German monopoly organizations surrounding the Saar has not ended. As the famous French economist Chardonnet said correctly: "Don't think that competing countries will make friendly gestures for free. Every country expresses its loyalty to 'Europe,' but 'European sentiment' (if there really is such a thing) cannot escape the ruthless laws of economic competition."

    围绕着萨尔的斗争并没有结束
    袁先禄
    自从法国和西德在六月份签订了关于萨尔问题的卢森堡协议以来，两国的官方人士在谈话中企图给人一种印象，似乎多年的争执已经消除了，两国合作的道路打开了。卢森堡协议规定了解决萨尔问题的办法：1957年1月1日萨尔将在政治上正式并入西德，到1960年再在经济上并入西德；作为对法国的补偿，西德同意让法国继续开采瓦恩特煤矿，资助修建摩塞尔运河的费用，并且在其他问题上也作了一些让步。两国政府所发表的公报说：关于萨尔问题的谈判“非常友好”，今后两国关系将“在密切和信任的合作中得到发展”。
    但是，无论是透露出来的某些有关谈判的情况，或是会谈后一些报纸的舆论，都不能证实这种故作乐观的论调。事实上，在会谈的最后一分钟，还发生了一次危机，使得西德外长勃伦塔诺深更半夜赶到法国大使馆去同法国人交涉。在协议公布以后，巴黎有些评论员就不安地指出：法国虽然从西德获得了一些对特定的工业界人士有直接利益的让步，然而由于要解散法国同萨尔的经济联盟，将要使法国的经济和政治地位遭到削弱。而西德的通讯社报道说：协议中关于修建摩塞尔运河的计划，是西德工业界大多数人所反对的。
    问题仍然是洛林的巨头和鲁尔巨头之间根深蒂固的矛盾。
    萨尔原来是德国的领土，但是它的丰富的煤藏一直吸引法国工业大亨的浓厚兴趣。第一次大战后，法国曾根据凡尔赛条约据有萨尔，直到1935年为止。第二次世界大战以后，法国作为对德占领国之一，重新在政治上和经济上控制了萨尔，并且把它的关税和货币也并入了法国的体系。法国垄断资本大力发展萨尔的煤钢工业，使这个面积只有两千平方公里的地区成为日益重要的工业基地。现在它每年产煤一千七百万吨，几乎等于法国产煤量的三分之一。钢的年产量将近三百万吨，等于法国钢产量的四分之一。法国的垄断资本掌握着萨尔，不但可以得到巨大的利润，而且使自己在同西德垄断资本进行竞争中处于比较相当的地位。另外，萨尔还是一个巨大的市场，法国每年可以在这里销售价值一千六百亿法郎的工农业产品。
    可是，战后迅速恢复起经济实力并且野心勃勃的西德垄断资本强烈要求“收回”这个工业基地。于是萨尔问题就越来越尖锐了，成为法国和西德之间长期争持不下的一个问题。
    1954年10月，为了使法国同意在使西德重新武装的“巴黎协定”上签字，西德政府和法国政府签订了一项使萨尔“欧洲化”的协定。但是，1955年10月萨尔的公民投票否决了违反他们意志的“欧洲法规”。在去年十二月举行的一次选举中，亲法的党派又失败了。绝大多数萨尔居民表示了他们要求回到德意志国家的愿望。这使得法国不得不同意这种要求。
    当然，法国的垄断组织不愿意轻易地放弃它在萨尔的利益。于是法国政府在谈判中提出了很多的条件。例如：要求在解决萨尔问题的同时必须解决修建摩塞尔运河的问题；修建这条运河，将使法国洛林的钢铁托辣斯得到一条运输费用低廉的出海航道，因而每年可以增加一百五十亿法郎的利润；要求到1980年为止再在萨尔藏煤最丰富的地区瓦恩特煤矿开采一亿三千万吨煤；因为这些煤是法国工业所迫切需要的；要求修改“欧洲煤钢联营”中关于代表权的规定，因为萨尔并入西德以后，法国在这个联营中钢产量的比重将下降到22％，就会失去至少控制钢产量25％的成员国才能享受的优先投票权。
    对于这些问题，双方在谈判中都有很多争执。就这样，从今年二月开始，法国和西德的外交部长比诺和勃伦塔诺，次长富尔和哈尔斯坦，还有他们领导下的很多专家们，从巴黎到波恩，又从波恩到巴黎，不断地讲价钱、争吵、互相威胁——这一切，就是谈判公报中所谓“非常友好”的内容。
    直到六月四日，法国总理摩勒和西德总理阿登纳在卢森堡举行了会谈。在这次会谈中，阿登纳对法国的某些经济要求作了让步，以换取法国同意及早把萨尔并入西德。于是，双方在六月五日签订了上面提到的卢森堡协议。
    但是，卢森堡的妥协并没有也不能解决法国和西德两国垄断组织之间的矛盾。从西方报纸和通讯社透露的情况可以看出，要拟订实施这项协议的办法，问题还是很多的。
    对于谈判中争执得最厉害的修建摩塞尔运河的问题，尽管西德政府已经同意了法国的计划，并且愿意负担一半以上的修建费用，然而运河开工的日子却是遥遥无期的。很难设想，西德的垄断资本集团会慷慨到出钱来改善它的法国竞争对手的地位。现在已经有消息传说，西德的专家们打算提出一些技术条件，来抵销法国利用运河所得的大部分好处。而且，由于这条运河将经过卢森堡，而卢森堡和同它有着经济同盟的比利时两国的冶金工业和铁路运输工业是反对开凿这条运河的。因此，西德的垄断组织也将利用这一点来作梗。阿登纳在协议取得以后就曾公开说过：可能会听到比利时和卢森堡的呼声，说摩塞尔运河也使它们的竞争地位恶化，人们必须在听取他们的意见之后再对这个问题发表意见。
    在瓦恩特煤矿的问题上，协议规定了到1970年为止法国还可以开采六千六百万吨的煤。但是英国“经济学家”杂志就指出，萨尔其它已经开发的矿井藏煤即将采尽，萨尔的煤矿企业将被迫更多地转向瓦恩特。协议并不能阻止在萨尔的领土上挖掘瓦恩特的煤，而这将使洛林煤企业的经营发生困难。
    还有很多引起争执的问题，在会谈中并没有达成协议。例如，萨尔最大的每年产钢八十五万吨的洛希林钢铁厂在1955年4月曾同法国商定由法国收购50％的股票。萨尔法规被否决以后，双方就发生了争执。今年五月，法国外交部次长富尔提出准备把这个争执提到国际法院。而在这次协议中并没有提到过去收购洛希林厂股票的协定是否继续执行。另外，货币兑换问题在协议中也没有具体的指示。“欧洲煤钢联营”中代表权的问题还待另行讨论。
    由此可见，尽管卢森堡会谈公报高唱“欧洲合作的最崇高的精神”，法国和西德垄断组织围绕着萨尔的斗争并没有结束。还是法国著名的经济学家夏同内说得对：“不要以为互相竞争的国家会无偿地做出友善的姿态。每个国家都表示忠实于‘欧洲’，可是‘欧洲情感，（如果真有这个东西的话）并逃脱不了经济竞争的无情规律。”
