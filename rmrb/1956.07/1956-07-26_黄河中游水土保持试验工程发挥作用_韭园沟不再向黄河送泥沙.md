Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 24th. Shaanxi Province, located in the area of the middle reaches of the Yellow River with serious soil erosion, has witnessed its first mountain gully delivering clear water to the Yellow River - Jiuyuan Gully in Suide County. On the 22nd, there was a heavy rainstorm here. As the rain poured down, the gully was shrouded in a white mist of rain. Various soil and water conservation field projects newly built on the surrounding slopes intercepted countless trickles of rainwater. In many areas planted with pasture, raindrops fell into the dense grass, and droplets of clear water seeped from the ground. In those steep barren gullies where field projects had not been built, the rainstorm formed huge mountain torrents, rolling down fiercely. However, they were intercepted by more than one hundred dams and weirs in the large and small gullies, and the water force became smaller and smaller. In the end, when it flowed into the reservoir at the mouth of the gully, the fierce waves were swallowed by the calm lake surface. A clear and pure stream of water was discharged from the reservoir's spillway. Outside the mouth of the gully, the land that was often ravaged by floods in the past is now covered with lush crops swaying in the wind and rain, appearing even more tender and lovely.

Jiuyuan Gully is an experimental gully for watershed management in the hilly and gully area of the middle reaches of the Yellow River, undertaken by the Yellow River Conservancy Commission. The drainage area of this gully is 70 square kilometers, with 5.3 kilometers of gullies per square kilometer. Due to the barren mountains and steep slopes, soil erosion was serious during heavy rains. In the past, this gully carried 795,000 metric tons of sediment into the Yellow River via the Wuding River every year. From 1953 to the present, under the guidance of the Northwest Yellow River Engineering Bureau of the Yellow River Conservancy Commission, local farmers have built five large-scale gully earth dams and eighty-six silt-retaining dams in this gully, planted trees and grass on the slopes, and built more than 15,000 mu of various soil and water conservation field projects. This year, these projects have played a role in controlling soil erosion. Now, with the same intensity of rainstorm, the amount of rainwater erosion in this gully is reduced by 41% compared with ordinary ungoverned gullies, and the silt interception efficiency reaches 100%. In the past three years, these dam and weir projects have intercepted a total of 885,000 cubic meters of silt during six or seven major rainstorms. From now on, Jiuyuan Gully will not only no longer send sediment to the Yellow River, but also can use the clear water in the gully's reservoir to irrigate more than 1,000 mu of land outside the gully during droughts.

Of the soil and water conservation projects already built in Jiuyuan Gully, the five large-scale gully earth dams were invested in by the state, while the remaining smaller projects were invested in by local farmers.

### 黄河中游水土保持试验工程发挥作用  韭园沟不再向黄河送泥沙

    黄河中游水土保持试验工程发挥作用
    韭园沟不再向黄河送泥沙
    新华社延安24日电　黄河中游水土流失严重的陕西省，今年出现了第一个给黄河输送清水的山沟——绥德县韭园沟。二十二日，这里降了一次很大的暴雨。当雨水倾盆而下的时候，这山沟里到处笼罩着一片白茫茫的雨雾。四面山坡上新修的各种水土保持田间工程，拦蓄了千万条雨水的细流。在许多种植牧草的地方，雨点落在茂密的草丛里，从地面上渗出了滴滴清水。在那些没有修筑田间工程的陡坡荒沟里，暴雨汇成了巨大的山洪，凶猛地滚滚而下。但是被大沟小岔的一百多道坝堰截拦，水势越来越小。到最后流入沟口的水库时，凶猛的浪涛就被平静的湖面吞没。从水库的泄水洞里，排出来一股清湛的流水。沟口以外，过去经常被洪水冲毁的土地上，现在一片茂盛的庄稼正在风雨中摇曳，越发显得嫩绿可爱。
    韭园沟是黄河水利委员会在黄河中游丘陵沟壑区进行流域治理的试验沟。这条沟的流域面积共有七十平方公里，每平方公里内有五点三公里的沟壑。由于山秃坡陡，每逢暴雨，水土流失严重。过去这条沟内每年经无定河输入黄河的泥沙有七十九万五千公吨。从1953年到现在，黄河水利委员会西北黄河工程局指导当地农民，在这条沟内修筑了五座大型沟壑土坝和八十六座淤地坝，在山坡上植树种草，以及兴修各种水土保持田间工程一万五千多亩。今年这些工程已经起了控制水土流失的作用。现在，在同样程度的暴雨里，这条沟内的雨水冲刷量比一般没有治理的沟壑减少了41％，拦泥效率达到100％。三年来，这些坝堰工程在六、七次较大的暴雨中，共拦泥八十八万五千公方。从此，韭园沟不仅不再给黄河输送泥沙，而且在天旱时可以利用沟内水库里的清水，灌溉沟外的一千多亩土地。
    韭园沟已修起的水土保持工程，除五座大型沟壑土坝由国家投资外，其余各项较小的工程都是当地农民投资的。
