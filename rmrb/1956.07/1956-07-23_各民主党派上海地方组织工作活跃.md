Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, July 22nd: The local organizations of various democratic parties in Shanghai have been very active in their work recently.

Since the Chinese Communist Party put forward the policy of long-term coexistence and mutual supervision with the various democratic parties, the organizations of various democratic parties in Shanghai have developed. The Shanghai Municipal Committee of the China Democratic League plans to recruit 500 new members from among middle and upper-level intellectuals this year, and it is now close to completion. In recent months, the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party has accepted nearly 200 new members from doctors, artists, and other fields, exceeding the total number of members developed in the past three years. The Shanghai Municipal Committee of the China Democratic National Construction Association currently has more than 2,000 members, double the number at the end of last year.

At present, the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang is carrying out propaganda work on the peaceful liberation of Taiwan among its members and the nearly 2,000 former Kuomintang military and political personnel and civil servants with whom it is connected. Many of them have already begun to do practical work to promote the early peaceful liberation of Taiwan. The Shanghai Civil Revolutionary Committee's publication, "Shanghai Civil Revolution," will be published publicly at the end of July. Lectures for former Kuomintang military and political personnel and new Civil Revolutionary Committee members will begin in early August.

The Shanghai Municipal Committee of the China Democratic League, the Shanghai Branch of the Jiusan Society, and their grassroots organizations have recently held meetings to mobilize members to actively participate in free academic debates and march towards science.

The Shanghai Municipal Committee of the China Democratic National Construction Association is now promoting its industrial and commercial members to formulate individual plans with participation in socialist competition as the main content. In the third quarter, the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the China Democratic National Construction Association plans to organize various seminars focusing on improving production and public-private relations, collect information and problems, and conduct special studies on the role of central factories and district stores.

    各民主党派上海地方组织工作活跃
    据新华社上海22日电　各民主党派上海市的地方组织，最近的工作很活跃。
    自从中国共产党和各民主党派长期共存互相监督的方针提出以后，各民主党派，在上海的组织都有了发展。中国民主同盟上海市委员会，预定本年内在中、上层知识分子中发展盟员五百人的计划，目前已接近完成。中国农工民主党上海市委员会最近几个月在医生、画家及其他各界人士中接受了近二百名党员，超过了过去三年发展的总数。中国民主建国会上海市委员会目前会员已经有二千多人，较去年年底增加了一倍。
    目前，中国国民党革命委员会上海市委员会正在所属成员和所联系的近二千名前国民党军政人员和公务人员中，展开和平解放台湾的宣传工作，他们当中的很多人已经开始做着促进台湾早日和平解放的实际工作。民革上海市委员会的机关刊物——“上海民革”，将在七月底公开发行。为前国民党军政人员和民革新党员举办的讲座将在八月初开讲。
    民盟上海市委员会、九三学社上海分社以及它们的基层组织，最近都召开了会议，发动成员积极参加学术上的自由论争，向科学进军。
    民建上海市委员会现在正在推动工商业者会员们订出以参加社会主义竞赛为主要内容的个人计划。在第三季度中，民建上海市委员会准备以搞好生产、搞好公私关系为中心，组织各种座谈会，搜集情况和问题并对中心厂的作用和区店的作用等问题，进行专题研究。
