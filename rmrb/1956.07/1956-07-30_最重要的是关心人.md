    “The Most Important Thing Is to Care About People”
    Yan Ling
    The people of the Urk State Farm on the newly cultivated land in the Kustanai Oblast of the Kazakh Republic love their farm and their work.
    In 1955, the farm encountered a severe drought, but no one wavered or was discouraged. Not a single person on vacation failed to return to the farm on time, and some young men even brought their beloved girls with them. Some young people who enlisted in the army wrote letters from the military saying that they would definitely return to work on the farm when their service was completed.
    People love their farm – this is the result of the farm's great achievements, and also the reason why the farm has achieved so much. Comrade Pulyakhin, the farm manager, told us: “There is no secret to success, the most important thing is to care about people.” “The more you contact the working masses, the better the work will be.”
    Comrade Pulyakhin told us the following story:
    In the autumn of 1954, one day in the middle of the night, Bautrakov, the director of the Second Branch, dragged Recheka, a tractor driver from the Fourth Work Team, to the farm manager's office. He said, "This Recheka is not a tractor driver at all, he's a wild ghost! You decide, either leave him, and I won't be the branch director; or keep me as the branch director, and get rid of him!”
    Recheka was indeed a stubborn, rude, and impolite young man at that time. He often disobeyed the captain's orders, was late, acted like a hooligan, and did not complete his work quota. When he came to the wilderness, his initial thought was just "to be freer in the wilderness." This time, his conflict with the branch director was caused by the following: When plowing the land, the branch director Bautrakov wanted each tractor to pull four five-bottom plows. Bautrakov went to the field and saw that Recheka's tractor was only pulling three. Bautrakov was annoyed and sternly questioned him why he didn't obey orders. He said, "This tractor can't pull that many!" Then he added, "You don't understand tractors at all, this tractor doesn't have enough horsepower!" Bautrakov also became agitated: "You little brat, teaching me a lesson?"
    In the farm manager's office, Bautrakov angrily asked the farm manager to fire Recheka. Recheka even more brazenly argued with Bautrakov. Later, the young man walked out the door with a flushed face and thick neck, saying that he was going to leave the farm.
    Comrade Pulyakhin stopped the young man. Based on his usual understanding of these two people, he felt that this matter could not be handled simply.
    Recheka came from Kharkov, Ukraine. During the Great Patriotic War, his parents were killed by fascist bandits, and he and his younger sister were sent to an orphanage, grew up in the orphanage, went to technical school to study, and then came to this place with the idea that "everything is unrestrained in the wilderness." He had no normal family life since childhood, forming a special personality. He needed sympathy and care, and maternal love. He was rude and impolite; but how did the branch director treat him? Sharp scolding and stern reprimands would only cause a more rude reaction in such a personality. Besides, it was necessary to find out whether the tractor could actually pull four plows. This type of tractor could indeed pull four plows; however, it also depended on what kind of land was being cultivated. On the land that Recheka was cultivating at the time, it was better to pull three plows. It was naturally not good for the young man to treat the branch director so arrogantly; however, how could the branch director not cause resentment by scolding people without taking a good look at what kind of land was being cultivated?
    Comrade Pulyakhin thought through these issues and spoke earnestly to the young man like a member of the family. He spoke with concern about his past life, about the years of the war, about the significance of peaceful construction and cultivating wasteland, and also about Recheka's younger sister who was still in the orphanage. "Where are you going if you leave? Can you still go back to the orphanage? Isn't collective life here interesting?" Comrade Pulyakhin also grew up in an orphanage, and he moved Recheka with his own experience and the process of his own ideological growth. Recheka understood his mistakes, resolved to correct them, and was willing to stay in this new big family and work hard.
    Comrade Pulyakhin also had an earnest conversation with the branch director, so that he understood his mistakes, understood how to correctly treat young people like Recheka, and how to care for and educate him regularly.
    The farm's Party organization also meticulously helped Recheka. The secretary of the Party organization patiently talked to him and helped the Fourth Work Team hold a meeting to discuss labor discipline. The facts that many comrades were working selflessly also gradually influenced Recheka.
    Recheka changed. His abundant energy was used in the right direction, and he was able to fully exert himself in his work; his work reached 200 percent of the labor quota. The farm manager, the Party organization, and the Youth League organization all praised him and often used his example to educate some workers who were still relatively backward. Recheka worked better and better, and became more and more friendly to his comrades. He not only corrected his own mistakes, but also enthusiastically helped other comrades correct their mistakes.
    Soon, Recheka was appointed as an assistant to the team leader. Because of his good work performance, he won the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League's Wasteland Reclamation Medal. Last year, he was elected as a member of the farm's Youth League Committee. In March of this year, Recheka was approved as a probationary member of the Party. The person who introduced him to the Party was precisely the branch director who was originally almost incompatible with him. Recheka is now a person who is praised and loved by everyone. He has already married in the new land and has his own warm family. His wife is a member of the Communist Youth League, from the Voroshilov Oblast of Ukraine, and works as a miscellaneous worker on the farm. They have their own house, raise a cow and some poultry, and live a very happy life, and work even harder.
    Not long ago, such a thing also happened on this farm:
    There was a young man named Maldonov, who was a tractor driver and also an accordion player. He was in love with a female hitch operator in the team. This spring, the young man suddenly went bad: drinking heavily, beating the girl, acting like a hooligan, and not working for days. When asked why he was like this, he said nothing. Some people thought that he should be severely punished, expelled from the farm, and sent to court.
    The farm manager was thinking about this matter: How could a good young man suddenly become like this? It would be easy to drive him out and send him to court; however, this is not a real way to be responsible to the country and to the people. He called Maldonov to his office and talked to him alone, asking Maldonov to tell him, as if he were his own father, what was going on. The farm manager's earnest concern made Maldonov truly regard the farm manager as a confidant. He told everything: He deeply loved this girl, they had been living together for six or seven months, but she suddenly didn't love him anymore. …
    The farm manager earnestly helped him, so that he realized that it was certainly wrong for the girl to do this; but it was also wrong for a young man to ruin himself like this for a girl's love, and he should cherish his future.
    A young man in this situation, if no one cares, no one understands, and all he gets is ridicule and punishment, it is hard to imagine what he would become. With a farm manager who cared about him like this, he obediently admitted his mistakes, repented, and cried. The farm manager also took care of him, fearing that he would not be able to calm down emotionally if he worked in the original work team, and asked him if he would like to work in another team. The young man strengthened himself and asked to return to the original work team.
    The farm manager told everyone, especially those who advocated driving the young man away: "I already understand his heart, and he will definitely work well in the future." - He was absolutely right, Maldonov has now become a very good worker.
    Comrade Pulyakhin said: "A farm manager cannot educate everyone on the farm. I always rely closely on the Party organization and the Communist Youth League organization." He is a Party member, and of course he has to attend every Party meeting; he also attends every Youth League congress and Youth League committee meeting, without missing a single one. There is also a most important method: let the workers educate themselves.
    The farm manager also attends every meeting of each work team and the general assembly of workers on the farm. If something happens that violates labor discipline, the main way to correct it is to discuss it at the workers' congress. Comrade Pulyakhin said: "Letting the workers discuss it themselves is much more effective than the farm manager issuing a disciplinary order."
    The farm leadership paid great attention to promoting and training cadres from outstanding workers, and also paid great attention to turning a large number of people without professional knowledge and skills into skilled workers, giving full play to everyone's strength.
    The farm leaders have never relaxed their attention to the urgent needs of the workers' lives. Comrade Pulyakhin always personally handles many things related to housing, food, and cultural life.
    Comrade Pulyakhin said: "When I first arrived in the wilderness, I went to a work team. A worker asked me: 'What should we do if we can't see movies? Can you think of a way to make us happy?' I paid attention to this issue. Soon I went to the city of Chelyabinsk and found a projection team to show movies to everyone. On Sundays and holidays, some trucks were allocated to the workers to go to the city to play and watch dramas. The farm relied on the Communist Youth League organization and gave as much support as possible in terms of materials and time arrangements, so that the farm's amateur cultural and recreational activities quickly became active.
    Workers who get married and ask the farm manager for money have never been refused; these loans are not immediately deducted when the salary is paid that month, but after a few months, when the workers' new family life is stable, they are allowed to pay them back. Some single women are relatively difficult, and the farm gives them a subsidy of two hundred rubles per person, and also sells them cheaper grain to feed poultry. Some single young men are also relatively difficult when they first come to the farm, and the farm provides them with beds, straw mats, and pillows.
    For the new farm, the most difficult thing is the housing problem. If the farm is to develop, it must first build enough houses. Comrade Pulyakhin said: "This problem has never left my mind." After more than a year, now the situation of two families living in one room is gone. However, in order for the workers to live well, each family should have three or four rooms. In the Soviet Union, it is not easy to obtain building materials. The farm manager regarded this as a key issue to solve, and at the beginning of the construction of the farm, he personally went to Sverdlovsk, Kurgan, Moscow, Magnitogorsk and other places to run around and find bricks, tiles, cement, lime, wood ... Before the first winter came, no one lived in tents anymore, and everyone moved into new houses. Now, more and better new houses are still being built.
    The farm leaders care about everyone on the farm, and the people on the farm naturally care about their farm; everyone cares about their farm, and the farm will naturally be well run. Correction: In the article "This is No Longer a Prairie" published on page 5 on July 8, "40 hectares" in the eleventh line from the bottom should be "400,000 hectares."

    “最重要的是关心人”
    燕凌
    哈萨克共和国库斯坦奈州新垦地上的乌尔?克国营农场的人们都热爱自己的农场，热爱自己的工作。
    1955年，农场碰到了严重的旱灾，没有一个人动摇、泄气，休假的人没有一个不按时回到农场来，有些小伙子还带着自己心爱的姑娘一起来了。有些青年应征入伍以后从军队中写信来说：服役期满复员的时候，一定还要回到这个农场来工作。
    人们都热爱自己的农场——这是这个农场有了巨大的成就的结果，同时也是这个农场得到巨大的成就的原因。场长普利亚兴同志告诉我们：“得到成就，没有什么秘密，最重要的是关心人。”“同工人群众接触越多，工作越好做。”
    普利亚兴同志告诉我们这样一件事：
    1954年秋天，有一天，半夜里，第二分场主任鲍特拉可夫扯着第四工作队的拖拉机手列契卡到场长办公室来了。他说：“这个列契卡，哪里是拖拉机手，简直是个野鬼！你决定吧，或者是把他留下，我不当分场主任；或者是还要我当分场主任，不要他！”
    列契卡，那时候的确是个倔强、粗暴、没礼貌的小伙子。他常常不听队长指挥，迟到，耍流氓，不完成工作定额。他到荒地上来，最初的想法只是“到荒地上可以更自由一些”。这一次他和分场主任的冲突是这样引起的：耕地的时候，分场主任鲍特拉可夫要每个拖拉机拉四部五铧犁。鲍特拉可夫到地里一看，列契卡开的拖拉机只拉了三部。鲍特拉可夫恼了，厉声责问他为什么不服从命令。他说：“这个拖拉机拉不动那么多！”接着还说：“你根本不懂得拖拉机，这拖拉机马力不够！”鲍特拉可夫也暴躁起来了：“你这毛头孩子，还教训我？”
    在场长办公室里，鲍特拉可夫怒气冲冲地要场长赶走列契卡。列契卡也更放肆地同鲍特拉可夫争吵起来。后来，小伙子脸红脖子粗地向门外走去，说要离开这个农场了。
    普利亚兴同志把小伙子叫住了。根据平时对这两个人的了解，他觉得这件事不能简单地处理。
    列契卡是从乌克兰的哈尔科夫来的。卫国战争时期，父母被法西斯匪徒杀死了，他和小妹妹被送进了孤儿院，在孤儿院长大，进工艺学校学习，然后怀着“荒地上一切都无拘无束”的想法到了这个地方。从小没有正常的家庭生活，形成了一种特殊的性格。他正需要同情和关心，需要像母亲一样的爱抚。他是粗暴的、无礼的；可是，分场主任又是怎样对待他的呢？尖刻的谩骂，厉声的斥责，对这样性格的人引起更粗暴的反应，又有什么奇怪呢？再说，究竟拖拉机能不能拉四部犁，这也得弄清楚。这种拖拉机的确可以拉四部犁；可是，还得看耕的是什么样的土地。在列契卡当时耕的土地上，还是拉三部犁比较好。小伙子那么傲慢地对待分场主任自然是不好的；可是，分场主任没好好看一看耕的是什么地就斥责人，又怎能不引起人的反感？
    普利亚兴同志想清楚了这些问题，恳切地像一家人那样同小伙子谈了话。关怀地谈到他过去的生活，谈到战争的年代，谈到和平建设和开垦荒地的意义，也谈到列契卡的现在还在孤儿院的小妹妹。“你要走，上哪儿去？还能回到孤儿院去吗？这儿的集体生活没有意思吗？”普列亚兴同志也是在孤儿院长大的，他用自己的经历、自己的思想成长的过程感动了列契卡。列契卡了解了自己的错误，决心改正自己的错误，愿意留在这个新的大家庭里好好劳动。
    普利亚兴同志也同分场主任作了恳切的谈话，使他了解了自己的错误，了解了应该怎样正确地对待列契卡这样的青年，怎样经常地关心他、教育他。
    农场党组织也细致地帮助了列契卡。党组织书记耐心地同他谈了话，并且帮助第四工作队开了讨论劳动纪律问题的会议。许多同志忘我地进行工作的事实也渐渐地影响了列契卡。
    列契卡变了。充沛的精力用到了正路上，在工作中充分地发挥了出来；他的工作达到了劳动定额的百分之二百。场长、党组织和团组织都表扬了他，常用他的事例教育一些仍然比较落后的工人。列契卡工作得越来越好了，对同志也越来越友爱了。他不但自己改正了错误，还热心地帮助别的同志改正错误。
    不久，列契卡就被任命为队长助手。因为工作成绩好，得了共青团中央发的开垦新地奖章。去年，他被选为农场团委会的委员。今年三月，列契卡已经被批准为候补党员。介绍他入党的，正是原来同他几乎是水火不相容的分场主任。列契卡已经是人人夸奖人人喜爱的人。他已经在新地上结了婚，有了自己的温暖的家庭。妻子是共青团员，从乌克兰伏罗希洛夫州来的，在农场做杂工。他们有了自己的住宅，养了一头奶牛和一些家禽，生活过得十分愉快，工作也做得更加起劲了。
    不久以前，这个农场里还发生了这样一件事：
    有一个叫马尔德诺夫的青年，是个拖拉机手，还是个手风琴手。他和队里的一个女挂引手相爱着。今年春天，这个青年突然变坏了：酗酒、殴打这个姑娘，耍流氓，好几天也不工作。问他为什么这样，他什么也不说。有些人认为，应当严厉地处分他，把他开除出农场，并且送到法院去。
    场长思索着这件事：好好一个青年，怎么突然会变成这样子呢？赶出去，送法院，那很好办；可是，这并不是真正的对国家负责、对人负责的做法。他把马尔德诺夫叫到了自己那里，一个人同他谈心，要马尔德诺夫把他当作亲父亲一样告诉他，究竟是为了什么事情。场长的恳切的关怀，使马尔德诺夫真地把场长当成了知心的亲人。他说出来了一切：他深深地爱着这个姑娘，他们已经同居了六七个月，她却突然不爱他了。……
    场长恳切地帮助他，使他认识到：这个姑娘这样做固然是不对的；可是一个年轻人为了一个姑娘的爱情这样作践自己也是不对的，应该好好地珍重自己的前途。
    一个年轻人，在这情况下，如果没人关心，没人了解，得到的只是讥笑和处分，很难设想会变成什么样子。有场长这样关心他，他却柔顺地承认了自己的错误，悔悟了，哭了。场长还照顾他，怕他在原来的工作队工作感情上不容易平静，问他是不是愿意到别的队去工作。小伙子坚强起来了，要求仍然回原来的工作队去。
    场长告诉大家，特别是告诉那些主张把这个青年赶走的人们：“我已经了解了他的心，他以后一定会很好地工作。”——一点也不错，马尔德诺夫现在已经成了一个很好的工作者。
    普利亚兴同志说：“一个场长，不可能教育全场所有的人。我老是紧紧地依靠着党组织和共青团组织。”他是一个党员，党的会议当然每次都要参加；团员大会和团委会议，他也每次参加，一次也不放过。还有一个最重要的方法：让工人群众自己教育自己。
    各个工作队的会议和全场的工人大会，场长也是每次都参加。发生了违反劳动纪律的事情，主要的纠正办法是在工人大会上讨论。普利亚兴同志说：“让工人群众自己讨论，比场长发处分命令效果好得多。”
    农场领导方面非常注意从优秀的工人中提拔干部，培养干部，又十分注意把大批没有专业知识和技术的人变成熟练工人，发挥了大家的力量。
    农场领导人员对于工人群众生活上的迫切需要，从来没有放松过注意。有关住宅问题、饮食问题、文化生活问题的许多事情，普利亚兴同志总是亲自处理。
    普利亚兴同志说：“刚到荒地上不久的时候，我到一个工作队去。一个工人问我：‘看不上电影，怎么办？能不能想个办法让我们乐一乐？’我就注意到了这个问题。不久就到车里雅宾斯克城里去，找到一个放映队来给大家放映电影。星期日和休假的时候，就拨给工人一些卡车，让他们到城市里去游玩、看戏。场方依靠着共青团组织，并且从物质上，时间安排上尽可能给以支持，使农场的业余文娱活动很快就活跃起来了。
    工人结婚，向场长请求借钱，从来没有遭到过拒绝；这些借款，并不在当月发薪的时候立即扣除，而要过几个月，等工人的新家庭生活安定了的时候才让他们还。有些单身妇女，比较困难，场方发给一个人二百卢布补助金，还把比较便宜的谷物卖给她们喂养家禽。有些单身的小伙子，才到农场来的时候也比较困难，场方供给他们床、草垫子，还给他们枕头。
    对于新的农场说来，最困难的要算住宅问题了。农场要发展，首先得建筑够用的房子。普利亚兴同志说：“这个问题一直没有离开过我的脑子。”过了一年多，到现在，两家住一间房子的情形是已经没有了。但是，要使工人很好地生活，每家应该有三四间房子。在苏联，得到建筑材料是不容易的事。场长把这当作一个关键问题来解决，建场之初，就亲自到斯维德洛夫斯克、库尔干、莫斯科、马格尼托哥尔斯克等地奔走、寻找砖、瓦、水泥、石灰、木材……。第一个冬天来到以前，没有一个人再住帐篷，大家都搬到新房子里了。现在，更多更好的新房子，还在不断建筑着。
    农场的领导人员关心农场里的每一个人，农场里的人自然也就都关心自己的农场；人人都关心自己的农场，农场自然就办好了。补正：　七月八日第五版刊登的“这里已经不是草原”一文倒数第十一行“四十公顷”应为“四十万公顷”。
