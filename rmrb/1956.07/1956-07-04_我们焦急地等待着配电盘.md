    We Anxiously Await the Distribution Panels
    The Anhui Fomei Hydropower Engineering Office ordered seven distribution panels from the Beijing Electric Motor Factory between July and August of last year. Both parties agreed that the goods would be delivered in March of this year. However, the Beijing Electric Motor Factory only delivered one unit on May 12th, four units on May 15th, and one unit on May 24th. One unit has still not been delivered to this day.
    The Beijing Electric Motor Factory's delayed delivery has greatly affected our construction project. The Foziling Hydropower Station is about to generate electricity, and many factories are waiting for us to transmit power; the flood that has been unconquerable for thousands of years is about to be tamed to serve us, but this cannot be realized as scheduled due to the delayed delivery of the distribution panels. It's truly a case of "all conditions are ready, except for the east wind." It is said that the Beijing Electric Motor Factory currently has more than ten overdue contracts, meaning that there are more than ten production or construction units, just like us, waiting for the "east wind." We hope that the Beijing Electric Motor Factory will quickly improve its management and take on the responsibilities it should bear.

    我们焦急地等待着配电盘
    安徽佛梅水电工程处在去年七、八月间向北京电机厂订制了七台配电盘，双方讲明今年三月交货。但是，北京电机厂一直到五月十二日才交出一台，五月十五日交出四台，五月二十四日交出一台，还有一台直到现在还没有交出来。
    北京电机厂误期交货，使我们的建设工程受到很大影响。眼看佛子岭水电站就要发电了，许多工厂都在等着我们送电；眼看千百年来不能为人们制服的洪水就要驯服地替我们服务了，就是因为配电盘误期交货而不能如期实现。这真是“万事具备，只欠东风”。据说，现在北京电机厂误期交货的合同共有十多个，也就是有十多个生产或建设单位，正像我们一样，等着“东风”。我们希望北京电机厂赶快改进管理工作，担负起他们应该担负的责任来。
