Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 11th: The Guangzhou Water Company has comprehensively overfulfilled its second-quarter production plan, achieving the guarantee conditions it put forward in its initiative to launch a competition with brother units across the country. On the 9th, the company sent a letter to all participating brother units, suggesting that they compile their summarized advanced experiences into written materials in order to widely exchange experiences and improve together.

After the company's employees issued a competition initiative to brother units across the country in March, it was responded to by water companies and water plants in forty-seven cities including Beijing, Shanghai, and Tianjin. Since the competition began, the company has summarized and promoted twenty-seven advanced experiences, and has established technical research contacts with many brother units through correspondence.

Due to the increase in water supply, the company installed new water pipes after entering the second quarter, and fully utilized the potential of the original water pipe equipment. It also took many measures to improve the quality of tap water, ensuring that the quality of tap water fully meets drinking hygiene standards.
