Xinhua News Agency, July 15th dispatch from New York: The United Nations Disarmament Commission continued its meeting on July 13th.

    Yugoslav representative Brilej explained the draft resolution proposed by the Yugoslav delegation on July 10th, which called for an agreement on practical measures for reducing conventional armaments and armed forces, stopping the experimental explosions of nuclear weapons, and reducing military expenditures.

    The Yugoslav representative said that the Soviet Union's agreement to the armed forces levels proposed by the United States, as well as other constructive suggestions included in Gromyko's speech on July 12th, greatly contributed to the convergence of views on the issue of disarmament. He said that the position taken by the Soviet Union proved the possibility of reaching an agreement on preliminary disarmament measures.

    Brilej also pointed out the significant meaning of the speech made by Indian Ambassador to the United Nations Menon on the issue of stopping experimental nuclear weapon explosions.

    Representatives from the United States, Britain, and Canada, as well as the French representative, opposed the Indian proposal to stop testing nuclear weapons. In order to conceal their rejection of the Indian proposal, they put forward a proposal to "limit" nuclear weapon tests. However, the Western representatives made this "limitation" dependent on the resolution of political issues, and they also advocated putting the restriction of nuclear weapon tests in a later stage of disarmament.

    The representatives of the United States, Britain, and Canada tirelessly attempted to prove that the current scale and speed of atomic weapon testing did not seem to pose any danger to human health and life.

    U.S. Representative Wadsworth said that the United States would continue to test nuclear weapons until a general agreement on disarmament was reached. He insisted that the United States could not "maintain security" without testing nuclear weapons. He said that the reason the United States "had to" develop nuclear weapons and test nuclear weapons was because the Soviet Union had great achievements in this area. The reasons listed by the U.S. representative were essentially justifications for expanding atomic armament.

    British representative Nadin and Canadian representative Martin's speeches agreed with Wadsworth's opinion.

    Soviet representative Gromyko spoke in support of the Indian proposal. He said that the Soviet Union's positive attitude towards the Indian government's proposal stemmed from the position the Soviet government had taken on this issue up to now. He said that the Soviet government had repeatedly proposed holding negotiations on banning such weapons tests and reaching such an agreement immediately, without making any agreement on other issues a prerequisite for this agreement.

    Gromyko then refuted the extremely negative attitude taken by Western countries, especially the United States, towards the proposal to ban nuclear weapon tests.

    Gromyko said, "We have drawn the attention of the representatives of Western countries to the fact that the Soviet Union is no more concerned about resolving this issue than other countries. The reason we put forward corresponding proposals on this issue and support similar proposals from other countries is that we believe that actively resolving this issue is in the common interests of all countries that demand an end to the arms race and the elimination of the threat of a destructive atomic war." Gromyko said that if an agreement could not be reached on this issue, and if Western countries continued to obstruct the resolution of this issue in the future, then nuclear weapon tests would continue, including Soviet nuclear weapon tests.

    Gromyko went on to say that under the current scientific and technological conditions, it is impossible to conduct atomic and hydrogen bomb explosions without these explosions being detected by others. This means that any violation of the corresponding international agreement would be known to everyone. Therefore, in order to discover such violations, there is no need for the specialized international supervision that is talked about so much in the disarmament discussions. This situation helps to reach an agreement on this issue, as long as there is sincerity in this regard, as long as there is a real willingness to make progress in resolving the disarmament issue.

    The committee's next meeting will be held on July 16th.

    在联合国裁军委员会十三日的会议上
    苏印南三国主张停止核子武器试验
    西方国家代表继续为进行试验狡辩
    新华社15日讯　据塔斯社纽约讯：联合国裁军委员会七月十三日继续举行会议。
    南斯拉夫代表布里列伊对南斯拉夫代表团七月十日提出的决议草案作了解释，这个决议草案要求就裁减常规军备和武装部队、停止核子武器的试验性爆炸和裁减军费问题的实际措施达成协议。
    南斯拉夫代表说，苏联同意美国提出的武装部队水平，以及葛罗米柯七月十二日的发言中所包括的其他建设性建议，大大地有助于大家在裁军问题上的看法的接近。他说，苏联所采取的立场证明了就裁军的初步措施达成协议的可能性。
    布里列伊还指出印度驻联合国代表梅农就停止核子武器的试验爆炸的问题所作的发言的重大意义。
    美国、英国和加拿大的代表以及法国代表反对印度提出的关于停止试验核子武器的建议。为了掩饰自己拒绝印度建议的做法，他们提出了“限制”核子武器试验的建议，然而西方国家的代表又使这种“限制”取决于政治问题的解决，而且他们还主张把对核子武器试验的限制放到较后的裁军阶段。
    美国、英国和加拿大的代表不厌其烦地企图证明，目前试验原子武器的规模和速度似乎对人的健康和生命没有什么危险。
    美国代表华兹沃斯说，在没有就裁军问题达成总的协议以前，美国要继续试验核子武器。他硬说，不试验核子武器就不能“维持安全”。他说，美国所以“不得不”发展核子武器和试验核子武器，是由于苏联在这方面有巨大的成绩。美国代表所列举的理由实质上是为扩充原子军备作辩解。
    英国代表纳丁和加拿大代表马丁的发言同意华尔沃斯的意见。
    苏联代表葛罗米柯发言支持印度建议。他说，苏联对待印度政府建议的肯定态度是从苏联政府直到现在在这一问题上所采取的立场出发的。他说，苏联政府曾经多次建议就禁止这种武器试验举行谈判，而且立即达成这种协议，不要以关于其他任何问题的协议作为这项协议的先决条件。
    葛罗米柯接着驳斥了西方国家，特别是美国对禁止试验核子武器的建议所采取的极端否定的态度。
    葛罗米柯说，我们已经提请西方国家的代表们注意这一点：苏联对解决这个问题并不比其他国家更在意。我们之所以就这个问题提出相应的建议和支持其他国家的类似的建议，是因为我们相信，积极解决这个问题，是符合要求停止军备竞赛和消除毁灭性的原子战争的威胁的各国人民的共同利益的。葛罗米柯说，如果在这一问题上达不成协议，如果西方国家今后仍然要堵塞这一问题的解决，那么，核子武器试验还要继续下去，其中也包括苏联的核子武器试验。
    葛罗米柯接着谈到，在现在的科学技术条件下，要进行原子弹和氢弹爆炸而又要使这些爆炸不被别人发现是不可能的。这意味着对相应的国际协定进行任何破坏都是会被大家知道的。因此，为了发现这种破坏，不需要在裁军问题讨论中谈得那么多的专门的国际监督。这种情况有助于在这一问题上达成协议，只要对这一方面具有诚意，只要真正愿意在裁军问题的解决上有所进展。
    委员会下次会议将在七月十六日举行。
