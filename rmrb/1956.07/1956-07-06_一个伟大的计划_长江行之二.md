    A Great Plan
    Yangtze River Journey (Part Two)
    By Our Special Correspondent Fang Ji

    To build a high dam at the Three Gorges, blocking the floods of the Yangtze River, and utilizing its infinitely rich water energy to generate inexhaustible electricity—this is a great ideal.

    As early as Sun Yat-sen's "Industrial Plan," the possibility of using the Yangtze River's water resources to produce large quantities of fertilizer was mentioned. Before the War of Resistance Against Japan, idealistic engineers had come to see the Three Gorges and proposed building a small power station in Yichang. During the late stages of the War of Resistance Against Japan, the famous American hydraulic engineer Savage also took a fancy to the Three Gorges and proposed that the United States invest, and use half of the electricity generated by the completed Three Gorges project to manufacture five million tons of fertilizer annually for fifteen years, selling it to the United States at a low price as repayment for the investment, thereby exploiting China's cheap labor and abundant water resources.

    But whether it was Sun Yat-sen's plan, the engineer's ideal, or the American's wishful thinking, they were all impossible dreams. Now, as our country enters the socialist era, a new historical period for the Three Gorges has begun.

    In 1955, leading personnel from relevant state departments, together with Soviet experts, inspected the Yangtze River situation and proposed a comprehensive utilization plan for the Yangtze River, as well as current work tasks, with the aim of completing the outline of the plan within this year and proposing comparative plans for the first phase of the project. Currently, tens of thousands of people are engaged in enormous work, from the Tongtian River at the source of the Yangtze to the estuary at Wusong, along the more than five thousand kilometers of the Yangtze River...

    One rainy morning in May, I met with the person in charge of the Yangtze River Water Conservancy Commission in a newly built red office building on the outskirts of Wuhan.

    Because of the rain, it was a bit chilly. He was wearing a yellow serge military overcoat and extended his injured hand to shake mine.

    "Want to see the Three Gorges?" he said, looking at the letter of introduction. "That is a place that poets find very interesting."

    He was casual, cheerful, and somewhat humorous, seemingly still retaining a military demeanor. So, I went straight to the point:

    "But, I'm afraid the most interested person is yourself..."

    "Not just myself," he interrupted, smiling. But after a moment of reflection, he continued, "It's difficult! My interest may be precisely because it's so difficult!"

    I didn't understand his meaning, looking at him, thinking it was just ordinary modesty. But he immediately spread out a "Yangtze River Basin Map," pointing to the blue river that runs across southern China, saying:

    "This is the Yangtze River." Following his finger, I swept from the northeastern part of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau all the way to Wusongkou.

    "More than five thousand kilometers long," he continued. "It flows through nine provinces, with a basin area of one million eight hundred thousand square kilometers, accounting for one-fifth of the country's total area; the basin's agricultural output accounts for 43% of the country's total agricultural output. The basin's population is more than two hundred and thirty million, accounting for two-fifths of the country's population. The annual runoff is one trillion cubic meters, equivalent to twenty-five Yellow Rivers; the hydropower reserves, according to known materials, can generate 140 million kilowatts, equivalent to 160% of the total hydropower reserves of the United States. The existing natural navigable mileage is 54,000 kilometers, accounting for 75% of the country's total annual water transport volume... As for the underground resources of the Yangtze River Basin, it is still an uncultivated virgin land!"

    He said all this in one breath, finally wanting to use a sentence with literary flair to end it. Perhaps he thought these numbers might be too dry for me; or perhaps he felt that he unintentionally revealed his love and pride for the Yangtze River and intentionally wanted to dilute it. But in any case, these numbers he said in one breath, without thinking, without checking notes, "like counting family treasures," were indeed worth being proud of!

    "But," he paused for a moment, changed the topic, adding a "but" which is often extremely important in any conversation. "The Yangtze River is not a ready-made meal that can be picked up and eaten!"

    He swept his palm across the Jianghan Plain on both sides of the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, and asked, visibly agitated:

    "Do you know about the 1931 flood? The flooded area was 100,000 square kilometers, 56.6 million mu of cultivated land, and 28.98 million people were affected, of which 185,000 died! The losses, calculated in silver dollars, were 1.28 billion!"

    He stopped and took a sip of tea.

    "What about the 1954 flood? It was much bigger than the 1931 flood! Although we conquered it, the flooded area was still one-third of that in 1931!"

    He stood across the table, leaning towards me, as if waiting for my answer. And I, listening to these alarming figures, felt a heartfelt sympathy for his slightly agitated state of mind. I nodded and, somehow, even sighed.

    He noticed something, smiled apologetically, and then forcefully chopped a palm down on the middle reaches of the Yangtze River, near the lower reaches.

    "What if we put a dam here?" he said.

    I leaned forward and looked at the map. His palm was like a dam, lying across the Three Gorges.

    "Or here, here."

    He moved his palm upwards twice in succession. That position was Chongqing and Yibin.

    "Of course, we can also consider solving the problem from the tributaries. For example," he raised his dam-like palm and drew an east-west oval circle in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River, from Yibin to Hankou, with one finger. This circle included the lower reaches of the Min River, the lower reaches of the Jialing River, and several of the largest tributaries of the Yangtze River, such as the Yuan River, Zi River, and Han River.

    "Or, like this," he narrowed the circle again, drawing a north-south oval circle on both sides of the Yangtze River between the Three Gorges and Hankou, which included the Three Gorges of the main stream, and the Yuan River and Han River of the tributaries.

    "All plans can be considered," he said cheerfully. "But, first of all, we must consider flood control; at the same time, power generation, irrigation, navigation, etc. We must use the best methods to achieve comprehensive utilization of the Yangtze River."

    When he said the last four words, he seemed to have emphasized them all, word by word.

    "This way," he put his dam-like palm on the Three Gorges again. "If the dam is built here, how much benefit will it bring to our country!"

    He asked the question with a tone of amazement, looking at me. I found that his eyes suddenly shone through his glasses.

    "The Yangtze River flood problem can be fundamentally solved," he continued, his voice calm and optimistic. "Ten-thousand-ton ships will be able to navigate directly to Chongqing all year round, and the Yangtze River floodwaters will be able to pass through the Yellow River and irrigate North China; more importantly, it will be able to generate 150 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity! That is to say, in terms of working energy, it is equivalent to doubling the labor force of the entire population of our country!"

    He said it so optimistically and confidently, as if filled with passionate fantasies. But for me, such large numbers lacked concrete concepts in my mind.

    He probably saw this and continued:

    "Of course, this is still an ideal, a plan. After all, it is too big, too concentrated, the construction requires too much time, and it is world-class in scale and technology, with no precedents to follow. This leads us to encounter not only extremely difficult technical problems, but also extremely complex economic problems."

    He paused, pondered for a moment, and asked in a self-deprecating, exploratory tone:

    "For example, how can we generate electricity ahead of schedule during the considerable construction period to meet the needs of national construction? How can we avoid interrupting the Yangtze River navigation, which accounts for three-quarters of the country's water transport, during construction?... This is a decisive prerequisite for the Three Gorges project..."

    The conversation stopped. I was also attracted by these problems, which seemed almost mysterious to me; and together with him, I fell into contemplation. For a long time, neither of us spoke; as if any sound at this time would hinder reasonable thinking about these problems.

    We remained silent until I finished a cigarette and he finished a cup of tea, then he slowly pushed the teacup away and asked me with a wry smile:

    "Do you know how creativity comes about?"

    I looked at his thin, bespectacled face. I understood what he meant, but didn't say anything. Then, he continued:

    "One way is through unintentional discovery during the labor process; and the other is through conscious overcoming of difficulties."

    After saying that, he slowly stood up and began to walk back and forth in the room, falling into deep thought again. Obviously, what he had just said was not to me, but to himself.

    But somehow, these words produced such a force in me: not for this person, but for the Yangtze River itself, I felt deep sympathy...

    Perhaps he felt a little embarrassed that he had unintentionally revealed the secrets in his heart. He suddenly walked up to me, extended his injured hand and said:

    "You should still go see the Three Gorges! The magnificent rivers and mountains and historical sites there may be more interesting to you than these brain-racking problems. Right now, we have an expert survey team about to set off."

    一个伟大的计划
    长江行之二
    本报特约记者  方纪
    在三峡筑起高坝，拦着长江的洪水，并且利用它无限丰富的水能，发出用之不竭的电力——这是一个伟大的理想。
    早在孙中山的“实业计划”里，就提到过利用长江水利资源，大量制造肥料的可能性；抗日战争以前，也有过有理想的工程师，来看过三峡，提出过在宜昌建立小型电站的建议；在抗日战争末期，美国出名的水利工程师萨凡奇，也曾看中了三峡，提出由美国投资，而用建成后的三峡所发电力的一半，在十五年内，每年制造出五百万吨肥料，廉价售予美国，做为投资的偿还，来榨取中国廉价的劳动力和丰富的水利资源。
    但是无论孙中山的计划，工程师的理想，和美国人的如意算盘，都是无法实现的好梦。现在，当我们的国家进入社会主义时代，三峡的新的历史时期也开始了。
    1955年，国家有关部门的领导人员，曾同苏联专家一起察看了长江情况，提出了长江综合利用的全面规划方向，和当前的工作任务，预定在今年内首先完成规划要点，并提出第一期工程的比较方案。现在，正有成千上万的人，在从上迄长江源头的通天河，下到吴淞的入海处，长达五千多公里的长江两岸，进行着巨大的工作……
    五月间一个阴雨的早晨，我在武汉市边缘区新建的一所红色办公大楼里，会见了长江水利委员会的负责人。
    因为下雨，天有些凉，他披了一件黄色的薄呢军大衣，伸出受过伤的手来和我握手。
    “想去看看三峡么？”他看着介绍信，一面说。“这倒是一个很使诗人们感觉兴趣的地方。”
    他很随便，很开朗，有些幽默，似乎仍然保持了一种军人风度。于是我也开门见山地说道：
    “但是，恐怕最有兴趣的，还是你自己……”
    “不只我自己。”他截断我的话，同时笑了。但沉思了一下，他接着说：“难哪！我之有兴趣，也许正因为它太难了！”
    我不明白他的意思，望着他，以为只是一种普通的谦虚。但他立刻熟练地摊开一张“长江流域图”，指着那条横贯祖国南部的蓝色河流说：
    “这就是长江。”顺着他的手指，我一眼从青藏高原东北部，一直扫到吴淞口外。
    “长五千多公里，”他接着说。“流经九省，流域面积一百八十万平方公里，占全国总面积的五分之一；流域的农产量占全国农产量的43％。流域人口两亿三千多万，占全国人口五分之二。年径流量一万亿公方，等于二十五个黄河；水能蕴藏，根据已知的材料，可以发电一亿四千万瓩，相当于美国全部水能蕴藏量的百分之一百六十。现有的自然通航里程是五万四千公里，占全国水运年总量的75％。……至于长江流域的地下资源，那更是一片未开垦的处女地了！”
    他一口气说下来，最后想用一句带有文学趣味的话来做结束。也许他觉得这些数目字对于我可能太枯燥；或者他觉得自己无意中透露了对长江的热爱和骄矜心理，而有意的想把它冲淡。但是不论如何，这些数目字他一口气说下来，不假思索，不查笔记，“如数家珍”一般，确也值得自豪呢！
    “可是，”他沉思了一会，转了话题，加进了一个在任何谈话往往是极端重要的“但书”。“长江并不是一碗现成饭，可以端起来就吃的！”
    他把手掌在长江下游两岸的江汉平原上抹了一把，显然有些激动地问道：
    “你知道1931年的洪水吗？淹没面积是十万平方公里，耕地五千六百六十万亩，受灾人口二千八百九十八万，其中死亡了十八万五千！损失按银元计算，是十二亿八千万！”
    他停下来，喝了一口茶。
    “1954年的洪水呢？比1931年大得多！虽然被我们治伏了，但淹没了的面积还有1931年的三分之一！”
    他站在桌子对面，身子倾向我，像是等待我的回答。而我，听着这些惊人的数字，对于他那微微有些激动的心理，发生了一种由衷的同情。我点点头，并且不知怎么，还叹了一口气。
    他有些察觉了，似乎抱歉地笑了笑，然后把一只手掌在长江中段靠近下游的地方有力地砍下去。
    “如果在这里放一座坝呢？”他说。
    我欠起身来，看看地图，他的手掌正像一座大坝，横在三峡上。
    “或者这里，这里。”
    他把手掌连续向上游移动了两下，那位置，是重庆和宜宾。
    “当然，也可以考虑从支流上解决问题。例如，”他抬起那高坝似的手掌，用一个手指在长江中游从宜宾到汉口之间划了一个东西长的椭园形的圈子。这个圈子里，包括了岷江下游，嘉陵江下游，和沅水、资水、汉水等几条长江最大的支流。
    “或者，这样，”他又把圈子缩小，在三峡到汉口之间的长江两岸划了一个南北长的椭园形的圈子，里面包括了干流的三峡，和支流的沅水和汉水。
    “各种方案都可以考虑。”他爽朗地说。“但是，首先要考虑防洪；同时，发电、灌溉、通航等等。用最好的办法，实现对长江的综合利用。”
    他说最后这四个字的时候，好像旁边都加了重点，一字一顿。
    “这样，”他又把那只高坝似的手掌放在三峡上。“如果大坝修在这里，会给我们的国家带来多大利益！”
    他用一种惊叹的口气提出问题，望着我。我发现，他的眼睛忽然透过眼镜发出光来。
    “长江洪水问题可以根本解决了。”他接着说，声音是平静而乐观的。“万吨轮船能够终年直航重庆，长江洪水能够经过黄河，灌溉华北；更重要的，它能够发电一千五百亿度！就是说，按工作能量计算，相当于我国全部人口的劳动力增加了一倍！”
    他说得那么乐观，自信，像是充满了热情的幻想。但对于我，这样大的数目字，头脑里是缺乏具体观念的。
    他大约看出了这一点，接着说：
    “当然，这在目前，还是一个理想，一个计划。毕竟，它太大了，太集中了，工程需要的时间也太长了，而且这在规模和技术上，都是世界性的，没有前例可援的。这样，就使我们碰到了不仅是极端困难的技术问题，而且涉及极为复杂的经济问题。”
    他停下来，沉思了一会，带着一种自言自语般的探索的口气问道：
    “比方，在相当长的施工期间，如何提前发电，来满足国家建设的需要呢？如何在施工中间，不致中断这占全国水运四分之三的长江航运呢？……这对于三峡方案，是具有决定性的前提条件……”
    谈话停顿下来。我也被这些在我听来差不多有些神秘的问题吸引了；和他一起，陷入沉思里。好半天，我们谁也不说话；仿佛这时候有什么声音，就会妨碍对这些问题的合理思索似的。
    就这样沉默着，直到我吸完了一支烟，他喝光了一杯茶，才慢慢把茶杯推开，带着一丝苦笑向我问道：
    “你知道创造性是怎么来的？”
    我望望他那削瘦的、带眼镜的的脸，我明白他的意思，但没有作声。接着，他说下去：
    “一种，是在劳动过程中无意发现的；而另一种，是在有意识地克服困难中产生的。”
    说完了，他慢慢站起来，开始在房间里走来走去，又陷入深深的思索里。显然，方才的话，不是对我，而是对他自己说的。
    但是不知怎么，这话却对我产生了这样一种力量：不是对这个人，而是对长江本身，发生了深深的同情……
    也许他觉得自己无意中说出了心里的秘密，有些不好意思。忽然走到我面前，伸出他那受伤的手说：
    “你还是去看看三峡吧！那里的壮丽的河山，古迹名胜，比起这些伤脑筋的问题来，也许会使你更感兴趣些。现在，我们正有一专家查勘组，就要出发了。”
