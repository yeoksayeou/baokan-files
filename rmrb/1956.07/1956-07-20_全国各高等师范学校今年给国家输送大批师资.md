    National Higher Normal Schools Send a Large Number of Teachers to the State This Year

    (Our newspaper reports) This summer vacation, a total of more than 17,300 undergraduate and associate degree students, and more than 380 graduate students from 40 higher normal schools across the country will complete their professional studies and join the ranks of people's teachers. From 1953 to this year, these schools have provided more than 43,000 teachers for secondary and higher education to the state.

    Due to the rapid development of higher normal education, the number of graduates from higher normal schools has been increasing year by year. The number of graduates in this session is the largest in any previous year, about four times more than in 1953.

    The distribution of this year's graduates from higher normal schools is basically based on the principle of "cultivating locally and allocating locally." However, due to the uneven development of cultural and educational undertakings in the past, some graduates from some provinces and cities will be transferred to support other regions, as well as the Military Commission and various secondary specialized schools directly under the Central Government. In addition to meeting the needs of secondary schools for teachers, many undergraduate graduates from this session will be retained as graduate students and teaching assistants. More than 380 graduate students trained by Beijing Normal University, Northeast Normal University, East China Normal University, and Renmin University of China will also join the work of higher normal schools.

    全国各高等师范学校今年给国家输送大批师资
    本报讯　今年暑假，全国四十所高等师范学校将有本科和专科学生一万七千三百多名、研究生三百八十多名完成专业学习，参加人民教师的队伍。从1953年到今年，各校已为国家输送了中、高等学校师资四万三千多名。
    由于高等师范教育的迅速发展，高等师范学校的毕业生逐年增加。本届毕业生人数较过去任何一年为多，约为1953年的四倍多。
    本届高等师范学校毕业生的分配，基本上采取“就地培养、就地分配”的原则。但是，由于过去各地文化教育事业发展的不平衡，有些省市的毕业生将调出一部分支援其他地区以及军委和中央直属各中等专业学校。本届各校本科毕业生除供应中等学校的师资需要外，将有很多人留作研究生和助教。北京师范大学、东北师范大学、华东师范大学和中国人民大学所培养的三百八十多名研究生，也将参加高等师范学校工作。
