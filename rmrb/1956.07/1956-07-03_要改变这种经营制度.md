    The Operating System Needs to Change
    Beijing State-Owned No. 2 Cotton Mill needed to install cooling equipment and required exhaust fans, but the Beijing branch of the China Transportation Electrical Equipment Company had no stock. They had to go to Tianjin to buy them. However, the Tianjin branch insisted on "not selling to other places." It is said that this is a sales system with separate "market leadership" and "planned control." Fortunately, Beijing State-Owned No. 2 Cotton Mill learned a public "trick" and found the Tianjin Textile Bureau, using their name to buy the exhaust fans. The goods were bought, but the purchasing agent suffered. Not to mention the running around beforehand, afterwards, because the invoice was not in the name of their own factory, it took a lot of effort to get the expenses reimbursed after returning to the factory.

    要改变这种经营制度
    北京国棉二厂安装降温设备，需要购买排气电扇，中国交通电工器材公司北京市公司无货，只好到天津去买。但是天津市公司坚持“不卖外地”。据说这是各有“市场领导”和“计划控制”的销售制度。幸好北京国棉二厂学习了一个公开的
  “窍门”，找到天津市纺织管理局，用他们的名义买到了排气电扇。东西是买到了，只是苦了采购员。事前的奔跑不用说，事后因为发票抬头开的不是本厂的，回厂后还费了一番工夫才报了账。　（张文源）
