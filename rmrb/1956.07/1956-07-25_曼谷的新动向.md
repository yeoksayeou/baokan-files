New "Mainland Goods" Arrive

In the markets of Bangkok, one can now see goods labeled "New Mainland Goods" everywhere – shiny Flying Pigeon bicycles, exquisite sewing machines and beautifully decorated radios, pristine white cotton yarn and lovely poplin, dazzling glassware and smooth-writing Golden Star brand pens... On the bustling sidewalks, vendors are hawking "Mainland Goods," "Mainland Goods" everywhere. Hundreds of thousands of overseas Chinese in Bangkok are once again fondly caressing the products of their homeland that they haven't seen for many years, some even shedding tears of excitement.

Artificial restrictions are beginning to break down. Chinese goods, carrying their traditional friendship, are returning to the Bangkok market. It was back in September of last year that the Thai government first relaxed import restrictions, allowing Chinese goods to enter the Thai market via Hong Kong. Since June of this year, "Mainland Goods" have been appearing openly, meeting the needs of the Thai people. Merchant ships in Bangkok's port are also preparing to set sail for New China.

Following this, some new developments have emerged:

On June 13th, the Thai State Council decided to allow the free export of rice and timber to all countries, including China and other People's Democratic countries.

On June 15th, Thai Prime Minister Pibul Songkram stated that establishing trade relations with communist countries is a developing trend in the overall international situation. He said that in order to adapt to the actual situation, it is necessary for the Thai government to readjust its trade policy towards China.

On the same day, Thailand's Minister of Finance and Acting Minister of Economic Affairs, Phra Phimolthamrong, acknowledged that direct trade between Thailand and China would help the Thai government implement its policy of lowering prices. He encouraged Thai businessmen to cast aside their concerns and boldly engage in trade with China.

On June 24th, the King of Thailand, in his address to Parliament, also mentioned that Thailand "will establish trade relations with all countries in accordance with the universally implemented trade system."

These are like a breath of fresh air, allowing the stifled Bangkok market to breathe. The market, which has been suffocating and tending towards decline for several years, is about to awaken.

What Has "U.S. Aid" Brought?

This change in the Bangkok market is not accidental. After World War II, the United States expanded its influence in Thailand, initially by purchasing rubber and tin and establishing various foreign firms. The U.S. Bank, established in 1950 with a capital of US$500 million, exceeds the total capital of all foreign banks in Thailand.

In 1950, the United States and Thailand signed the "U.S.-Thai Military Assistance Agreement" and the "U.S.-Thai Economic and Technical Assistance Agreement," and later dragged Thailand into the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization. The United States established military bases in Bangkok, Sattahip, Chiang Mai, Songkhla, Pattani, and other places in Thailand. Seven or eight hundred American advisors of various kinds filled the Thai Ministry of Defense, Ministry of Economy, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Police Department, and other institutions. American officers have the right to investigate the use of Thai military supplies at any time. The "military assistance" provided by the United States is mostly surplus and outdated military equipment. The so-called "economic assistance" is mostly used in areas related to the military. For example, on February 6th of this year, the U.S. International Cooperation Administration announced a US$33.3 million plan to "aid" Thailand in 1956, of which "defense assistance" accounted for US$28.5 million, and "technical cooperation assistance" accounted for only US$4.8 million. And this limited "technical cooperation assistance" is also designated for purchasing American goods. It is no wonder that the Thai newspaper "Sanseri" lamented that Thailand needs industrial equipment, but what it gets are outdated military supplies, purchase contracts, or debt receipts!

These "assistance" measures, which are more trouble than they are worth, come with all sorts of conditions!

For example, the United States demands that Thailand expand its army and increase its military spending, and prohibits Thailand from trading with countries in the socialist camp. For example, the United States even established an economic committee in Washington specifically to "lead" Thailand's economy. The former U.S. Ambassador to Thailand, Donovan, is the head of this committee. Various U.S. "representatives" and "advisors" enjoy diplomatic privileges and are not restricted when entering and leaving Thailand. American civilians generally do not need visas to enter Thailand. Thai public and private enterprises are not allowed to compete with the United States in the market. The Thai government must prepare a counterpart fund equal to the value of the "U.S. aid" materials and deposit it in the Bank of Thailand for the U.S. government to use in implementing "assistance."

The Suffocated Thai Economy

The damage caused by "U.S. aid" to the Thai economy is incalculable.

Thailand is an agricultural country, and rice is its traditional export commodity, accounting for 41%-66% of total exports, and it also occupies an important position in the budget (rice export revenue in 1955 accounted for 17% of the year's revenue). However, the United States dumps its surplus agricultural products in Asia, seizing Thailand's rice markets in Asia, Europe, and South America, causing Thailand's rice exports to plummet. In 1951, Thailand exported 1.58 million tons of rice; in 1954, it fell sharply to about 1 million tons, while Thailand has more than 2 million tons of rice available for export. Thailand's rice sales are also difficult this year. Japan is Thailand's largest customer for rice; in 1954, the share of Thai rice exports purchased by Japan accounted for 52%. This year, Japan and the United States signed an agreement to purchase surplus agricultural products, and they will purchase American rice. According to an Associated Press report, the U.S. Department of Agriculture announced on March 22nd that 500,000 tons of rice would be shipped to the Far East, which poses an even greater threat to Thailand's rice exports. According to the Thai Ministry of Economy's Department of Foreign Trade, Thailand exported only more than 380,000 tons of rice in the first four months of this year, a decrease of more than 18% compared to the same period last year. The Thai rice industry is now in a difficult situation, and most rice mills are in a state of semi-suspension.

Rubber is Thailand's second most important export commodity, accounting for 12%-33% of total exports. In 1951, the United States and Thailand signed an agreement to purchase rubber, adopting a monopolistic and price-depressing approach, causing Thailand to suffer continuous losses. Thailand's rubber revenue was US$97.7 million in 1951, but plummeted to US$43.9 million in 1954, a decrease of more than half. At present, the price of Thai rubber has been forcibly lowered by the United States by one-third, from 19 baht to 10 baht per kilogram. It is estimated that Thailand loses nearly 600 million baht each year. Eisenhower's announcement on May 1st of this year that the United States will produce 1.7 million tons of synthetic rubber within two years has made Thai rubber industry人士 very worried about losing the rubber market that Thailand has unilaterally developed for six years.

Due to the sharp decline in exports and the increase in imports (massive imports of military supplies), Thailand, which has always had a trade surplus, began to have a trade deficit in 1952. Coupled with gold imports, foreign investment profits, and expenses for insurance and transportation, a large deficit in the balance of international payments was created. The deficit was US$36.6 million in 1952, increased to US$57.2 million in 1953, and the trade deficit alone was US$29 million in 1954.

In the face of sharply declining revenues, the Thai government was also forced to expand its army and prepare for war, increasing military spending, thus creating a large fiscal deficit. From 1953 to 1955, the deficit totaled 3,726 million baht. The deficit for 1956 is estimated to be 1,159 million baht, accounting for about 20% of total expenditures. Military and police expenditures account for more than 40% of total expenditures, while economic construction expenditures account for only 11%.

Under the pressure of such huge deficits, the Thai government's debt has increased dramatically. In the past three years, the Thai authorities have borrowed 8 billion baht from home and abroad, which is equivalent to Thailand's budget revenue for two years.

In order to make up for the deficit and solve the financial difficulties, the Thai government has increased the issuance of currency and increased taxes. As a result, inflation has occurred and prices have risen. According to statistics, the cost of living index in 1954 was 18 times higher than in 1939, and it rose by another 12% in the eight months from October 1954 to May 1955. As a result, industry and commerce have collapsed, and tens of thousands of people have become unemployed. The wages earned by workers are less than half of the cost of living. Since the beginning of this year, dozens of stores in Bangkok have closed down one after another. In mid-March, four major commercial banks collapsed simultaneously, with the largest one owing 31 million baht, shocking the Bangkok market. Many rubber trading firms are in a state of semi-suspension due to the difficulties in rubber trade, and many stores are laying off employees and reducing salaries in order to cope with the crisis.

Don't Want "Unfaithful Friends"

With the easing of the international situation and the failure of the U.S. "policy of strength," people from all walks of life in Thailand are increasingly aware that continuing to expand the army and prepare for war will only bring more disasters to Thailand. The trend of peace and independence, which has been increasingly strengthened in the vast areas of Asia after the Asian-African Conference, and the increase in understanding and cooperation among Asian and African countries, have also had a profound impact in Thailand. Many Thai political party leaders and people from all walks of life have called on the government to change its current foreign policy, break away from the shackles of the United States, and demand peaceful coexistence with all countries and the development of normal, mutually beneficial trade with other countries.

An editorial in Thailand's "Yong Heng Bao" pointed out that the time has come for the Thai government to re-examine and adjust its foreign policy. Thailand should make itself an independent country, adopt a neutral policy, and establish friendly relations with all countries in the world.

"Thai Ping Weekly" also said, on the issue of recognizing China and establishing trade relations with China, why should Thailand still listen to Washington's orders? Why should Thailand still care about this "unfaithful friend"?

In the editorial "Learn from Neighboring Countries," the "Siam Mass Daily" made a clear comparison between Thailand's situation and that of Burma. The editorial stated that Burma is now able to export 1.8 million tons of rice because the Burmese government has established friendship with various countries and expanded the rice market. Although Thailand produces a large amount of rice like Burma, it does not know who to sell the rice to or how to sell it.

Under these circumstances, Thailand has begun to take measures to adjust its foreign trade and international relations. This new trend in Thailand has been welcomed by peace-loving people from all countries, but the U.S. government cannot conceal its panic and unease. This February, the U.S. deployment of troops in Bangkok (to participate in the so-called Manila Pact military exercises) was an attempt to "intimidate and curb the growing neutralist tendencies in Thailand." In late May, the U.S. "New York Times" consecutively published three articles by its Bangkok correspondent, Robert Alden, which insulted the Thai government, even saying that "the United States is the real government of the Thai people." This is truly a rogue act of intimidation followed by abuse when intimidation fails. Prior to this, the economic counselor of the U.S. Embassy in Bangkok requested the Thai Ministry of Economy to report to him on the trade between Thailand and socialist countries. The secretary of the U.S. Embassy in Thailand also personally visited the Bangkok Chinese General Chamber of Commerce to learn about the sales of Chinese goods in Thailand. When these reconnaissance, investigations, intimidations, and abuses all proved ineffective, the United States resorted to its last resort - brandishing its monetary magic weapon. It even demanded that Thailand pay for the expenses of participating in the Korean War - 2 billion baht (which is equivalent to half of Thailand's annual revenue)!

However, these methods of the United States cannot suppress the Thai people, just as it cannot suppress the increasingly developing trend of peace and neutrality in the world. The recent statement by the Thai government that Thai businessmen can visit China and the Soviet Union is a resounding response to the high-pressure policy of the United States.

    曼谷的新动向
    金凤
    新到“大陆货”
    在曼谷市场上，现在，到处可以看到标着“新到大陆货”的商品——闪亮的飞鸽牌的自行车，精致的缝衣机和装璜美丽的收音机，洁白的棉纱和美丽的真珠布，光采夺目的玻璃器皿和书写流利的金星牌钢笔……热闹的人行道上，小贩到处在叫卖着“大陆货”、“大陆货”。曼谷的几十万华侨重新亲切地抚摸着好几年不见的乡土产品，有的激动到掉下泪来。
    人为的束缚开始打破了。中国商品带着它传统的友谊重新回到曼谷市场。那还是在去年九月，泰国政府第一次放松进口，允许中国商品从香港转口进入泰国市场。从今年六月起，“大陆货”便公开露面，供应泰国人民的生活需要。而曼谷港口的商船，也在准备启程前来新中国了。
    接着，又出现了这样一些新的动向：
    六月十三日，泰国国务院会议决定允许自由输出大米和木材给所有国家，包括中国和其他人民民主国家。
    六月十五日，泰国国务总理銮披汶说，同共产党国家建立贸易关系已经是整个国际局势的发展趋势。他说，泰国政府为了适应实际情况，重新调整对中国的贸易政策是必要的。
    同一天，泰国的财政部长兼代理经济部长拍母里攀·裕他吉承认，泰国同中国进行直接贸易有助于泰国政府推行压低物价的政策。他鼓励泰国商人打破顾虑，大胆同中国进行贸易。
    六月二十四日，泰国国王在议会致词，也谈到泰国“将按照世界普遍执行的贸易制度同各国建立贸易关系。”
    这些就像是一股清凉的风，使郁闷的曼谷市场透过一口气来。几年来被窒息得趋于雕零的市场将要苏醒了。
    “美援”带来了什么
    曼谷市场上这种变化并不是偶然的。第二次世界大战以后，美国就在泰国扩张它的势力，起先是收购橡胶和锡，在泰国设立各种洋行。1950年建立的美国银行资本额五亿美元，超过所有在泰国的外国银行资本的总和。
    1950年，美国和泰国签订了“美泰军事援助协定”和“美泰经济技术援助协定”，后来又把泰国拖进了东南亚条约集团。美国在泰国的曼谷、梭桃邑、清迈、宋卡、北大年等地建立了军事基地。七、八百名各式各样的美国顾问充塞在泰国的国防部、经济部、外交部、警察厅和其他机构。美国军官有权随时调查泰国军事物资的用途。美国提供的“军事援助”，绝大部分不过是美国剩余的和过时的军火装备。所谓“经济援助”，大部分也是用在和军事有关的方面。例如今年二月六日美国国际合作署公布1956年“援助”泰国的计划为3，330万美元，其中“国防援助”即占2，850万美元，“技术合作援助”仅有480万美元。而这点有限的“技术合作援助”还被指定购买美国物资。难怪泰国“桑塞里报”慨叹泰国需要的是工业设备，得到的只是过时了的军火、购货合约或是欠债的单据！
    就是这些得不偿失的“援助”却附带有各种各样的条件！
    譬如美国要求泰国扩大军队和增加军费，禁止泰国同社会主义阵营各国进行贸易。譬如美国竟然在华盛顿专门成立了一个经济委员会，来“领导”泰国的经济。美国驻泰国的前任大使杜诺万就是这个委员会的负责人。美国的各种“代表”、“顾问”都享有外交官员特权，出入泰国不受限制。美国一般平民进入泰国也不需要签证。泰国公私企业不得与美国作市场上的竞争。泰国政府必须准备一笔与“美援”物资相等的对等基金存入泰国银行，供美国政府执行“援助”时应用。
    被窒息的泰国经济
    “美援”给泰国经济所造成的损害是难以估计的。
    泰国是农业国家，大米是它的传统的出口商品，占出口总值41％—66％，在预算中也占重要地位（1955年大米出口收入即占同年收入的17％）。而美国在亚洲倾销它的剩余农产品，夺去泰国大米在亚洲、欧洲和南美洲的市场，使泰国大米出口锐减。1951年泰国出口大米158万吨，1954年猛跌至100万吨左右，而泰国可供出口大米有200万吨以上。今年泰国的大米销路也感困难。日本是泰国大米的最大主顾，1954年泰国大米出口日本购买的份额占52％，今年日本和美国签订了购买剩余农产品协定，要购买美国的大米了。又据美联社消息，美国农业部三月二十二日宣布将有50万吨大米运往远东，这对泰国大米出口的威胁更大。据泰国经济部对外贸易厅公布，今年头四个月泰国输出大米只有三十八万多吨，较去年同一时期减少18％以上。泰国米业现在正处于困难境地，碾米厂大部陷于半停工状态。
    橡胶是泰国第二宗重要的出口物资，占出口总值12％—33％。1951年美国和泰国签订了购买橡胶的协定，采取了垄断压价的办法，使泰国不断受到损失。泰国橡胶收入1951年为9，770万美元，1954年惨跌至4，390万美元，即减少一倍以上。目前泰国橡胶价格被美国硬压低三分之一，每公斤由十九铢压到十铢，据估计，泰国每年损失将近六亿铢。而艾森豪威尔在今年五月一日宣布美国将在两年内生产一百七十万吨人造橡胶，使得泰国橡胶业人士十分担心会失去泰国六年来片面发展的橡胶市场。
    由于出口锐减，进口增加（大量输入军事物资），一向出超的泰国从1952年起开始入超；加上黄金输入、外国投资利润及保险、运输等支出，造成国际收支很大逆差。1952年逆差3，660万美元，1953年增至5，720万美元，1954年仅对外贸易就入超2，900万美元。
    在收入锐减的情况下，泰国政府还被迫扩军备战，增加军费支出，因而造成很大的财政赤字。从1953—1955三年中赤字共达372，600万铢。1956年赤字估计为十一亿五千九百多万铢，约占总支出20％。总支出中军警开支占40％以上，经济建设费用只占11％而已。
    在这样巨额的赤字重压下，泰国政府债务剧增。过去三年中，泰国当局向国内外所借款项已达八十亿铢，约等于泰国两年的预算收入。
    泰国政府为了弥补赤字，解决财政困难，便增发通货，增加税收。结果通货膨胀，物价高涨。据统计，1954年生活指数比1939年高十八倍，从1954年10月到1955年5月这八个月中又上涨12％。结果工商业倒闭，成千上万人失业，工人所得工资不及生活费的一半。今年以来，曼谷已有几十家商店相继倒闭。三月中旬四大商行同时倒闭，最大的一家负债达3，100万铢，震动了曼谷市场。许多橡胶商行因橡胶贸易困难处于半停业状态，许多商店为了应付危机，裁员减薪。
    不要“不忠实的朋友”
    随着国际局势的缓和以及美国“实力政策”的失败，泰国各界人士越来越认识到继续扩军备战给泰国只会带来更多的灾难。亚非会议以后在亚洲广大地区日益加强的和平、独立的趋向，和亚非各国之间的谅解、合作的增加，在泰国也发生了深远的影响。泰国许多政党领袖和各界人士纷纷呼吁政府改变现行的外交政策，摆脱美国的束缚，要求和所有国家和平共处，发展同其他国家的正常的互利的贸易。
    泰国“永恒报”的社论指出，现在已经到了泰国政府重新研究调整它的对外政策的时候了。泰国应当使自己成为一个独立的国家，采取中立政策，同世界上所有国家建立友好关系。
    “泰屏周报”也说，在承认中国和同中国建立贸易关系的问题上，泰国为什么还要去听华盛顿的命令呢？泰国为什么还要挂怀于这个“不忠实的朋友”呢？
      “暹罗群众报”在“向邻国学习”的社论中更将泰国处境和缅甸作了鲜明的对比。社论谈到缅甸现在能输出一百八十万吨大米，因为缅甸政府同各国建立友谊，扩大了大米市场；泰国虽然像缅甸一样生产了大量大米，但它却不知道将要把大米出售给谁和如何出售。
    在这种情况下，泰国开始采取措施来调整它的对外贸易和国际关系。泰国这种新的趋向受到爱好和平的各国人民的欢迎，美国政府却掩饰不了它的惊惶与不安。今年二月，美国陈兵曼谷（参加所谓马尼拉条约的军事演习）就是“威吓和制止泰国日益增长的中立主义倾向”的一次尝试。五月下旬，美国“纽约时报”又接连刊载了该报驻曼谷记者罗伯特·艾尔登的三篇侮辱泰国政府的文章，竟说“美国才是泰国人民的真正政府”。这真是恫吓不灵继以谩骂的无赖行径。在这以前，美国驻曼谷大使馆经济参赞要求泰国经济部向他报告泰国同社会主义国家贸易情况。美国驻泰大使馆秘书也曾亲访曼谷中华总商会了解中国商品在泰国的销售情况。当这些侦察、调查、恫吓、谩骂都归无效的时候，美国又使出它的最后一着——祭起它的金元法宝来。它竟要求泰国偿付参加朝鲜战争的费用——二十亿铢（这等于泰国一年收入的一半）！
    但是，美国的这种手段是压制不了泰国人民的，就像它压制不了在全世界越来越发展的和平中立的趋向一样。泰国政府最近表示，泰国商人可以访问中国和苏联，就是对美国的高压政策的一个响亮的回答。
