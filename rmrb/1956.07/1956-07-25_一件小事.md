    A Small Matter
    Sāng Kē
    I would like to borrow Mr. Lu Xun's title to talk about something he once discussed.
    There is a passage in "Huagai Collection" like this:
    "Better Chinese and Western books always have one or two blank endpapers before and after each book, and the top and bottom margins are also very wide. However, newly printed Chinese books in recent times mostly have no endpapers, and the top and bottom margins are very short. If you want to write some opinions or something else, there is no room for it. When you open the book, it is full of dense black characters; coupled with the pungent smell of oil, it gives people a sense of oppression and embarrassment, not only is there little 'joy of reading,' but it also feels as if life has no 'leeway' and 'leaves no room.'"
    He went on to say that in the atmosphere of "leaving no room," people's spirits are generally squeezed; and when people lose their sense of leeway or unconsciously embrace a heart that leaves no room, the future of this nation is probably worrying. Therefore, he said that although this is a matter as small as a cow's hair, it is one aspect of the spirit of the times at that time, a manifestation of a "degenerate" and "fallen" spirit, and is from the same source as the flimsiness of appliances, the shoddy construction of buildings, the perfunctory handling of affairs, not wanting to be "good-looking," not wanting to be "durable."
    This year is the 20th anniversary of Mr. Lu Xun's death. It has been even longer, 31 years, since he wrote this passage. All aspects of our country have undergone extraordinary and tremendous changes. But in this small matter, there seems to be no progress. If you look at some new books printed thirty years ago, you may have to admit that our general publications now are even more "crude and simple" and "leave no room" than they were then.
    Of course, it cannot be said that this is a manifestation of the spirit of our times today, nor can we think that the future of our nation is worrying from this matter. But, why is there no progress in this matter? Publishers may be able to give various reasons. Perhaps the most important reason is to save money. Saving paper is entirely necessary. As long as we reduce some unnecessary and dispensable publications, we can save a lot of paper, without having to make every book "crude and simple" in order to save money.
    Dictionaries, reference books, and publications of a reference nature are only consulted when people need to look them up, so it makes sense to print the characters smaller and denser. But printing all books like the old eight-fold books is not only unsightly and impractical, but it also does not arouse readers' interest in liking and preserving them. They are often thrown away after reading, which may be a waste in terms of the wealth of the entire society. There were such publications that used not only small No. 5 fonts, but also No. 6 fonts to print. This really easily makes people think that those articles are probably worthless and do not need to be read by everyone. Older people cannot see the ant-like characters clearly. For younger people, it is a kind of damage to their eyesight.
    When we look at the old woodblock books, the fonts are so large, and there is so much blank space at the top and bottom margins, we cannot help but admire the preferential treatment that the works of the past authors received. Those particularly exquisitely engraved books are even more like one of the hallmarks of the high achievements of our country's past culture. No wonder some people collect them as works of art.
    If we acknowledge the importance of people's spiritual life, we cannot ignore these kinds of small things. Printing books in a very simple way and building dormitories all like pigeon cages, if this approach is promoted, there will be no need for parks and squares in the city, and literature and art will become luxuries and should be abolished altogether. Mr. Lu Xun raised this kind of small matter to the level of the spirit of the times and the future of the nation, and it must be said that he had great insight. It should be said that this kind of perfunctory and careless approach is not in line with the spirit of our times today, and it is also contrary to the fine traditions of our nation.

    一件小事
    桑珂
    我想借用鲁迅先生的这个题目来谈一件他曾经谈过的事情。
    “华盖集”里面有这样一段话：
    “较好的中国书和西洋书，每本前后总有一两张空白的副页，上下的天地头也很宽。而近来中国的排印的新书则大抵没有副页，天地头又都很短，想要写上一点意见或别的什么，也无地可容，翻开书来，满本是密密层层的黑字；加以油臭扑鼻，使人发生一种压迫和窘促之感，不特很少‘读书之乐’，且觉得仿佛人生已没有‘余裕’，‘不留余地’了。”
    他接着还说，在这种“不留余地”的空气的围绕里，人们的精神大抵要被挤小；而人们到了失去余裕心或不自觉地满抱了不留余地心的时候，这民族的将来恐怕就可忧虑了。因此，他说这虽然是比牛毛还细小的事情，但却是当时的时代精神表现之一端，是一种“窳败”、“堕落”的精神的表现，和器具之轻薄草率，建筑之偷工减料，办事之敷衍一时，不要“好看”，不要“持久”，出于同一病源。
    今年是鲁迅先生逝世二十周年纪念。从他写这段话的时候算起，更有三十一年之久了。我们的国家的各个方面都已经发生了异常巨大的变化。但在这件小事上却好像并没有什么进步。如果找一些三十年前排印的新书来看一看，恐怕不得不承认，我们现在的一般出版物比那时候更加“因陋就简”，更加“不留余地”了。
    当然不能说这是我们今天的时代精神的表现，也不能从这件事情就想到我们民族的将来可忧虑。但是，到底为什么在这件事情上没有进步呢？出版家们也许可以说出种种理由。也许最重要的理由是为了节约。节约纸张是完全应该的。只要减少一些不必要的和可出可不出的出版物，就可以节约出很多纸张，而不必为了节约，使每一本书都“因陋就简”。
    字典、辞书和资料性质的出版物，人们只是参考时才去翻阅，字印得小一些，密一些，是有道理的。但把什么书籍都印得像过去的一折八扣书一样，既不美观，又不适用，一点也引不起读者的爱好和保存的兴趣，常常读完后就随手扔掉，从整个社会的财富来说，倒或许反而是浪费。曾经有那样的刊物，不但用小五号字，而且用六号字来排印。这实在容易使人想到，那些文章大概是没有价值的，不必大家去读的。年纪大的人无法看清那蚂蚁一样的字。对于年纪轻的人，却又是对他们的目力的一种损害。
    我们翻看过去的木板书，字体那样大，天地头有那样多空白，不能不羡慕过去的作者的著作所受到的那种优待。那些刻印得特别精的书籍更好像是我国过去的文化的高度成就的标志之一，无怪乎有人把它们当作美术品一样收藏了。
    如果我们承认人的精神生活的重要，就不能忽视这一类的小事情。把书籍印得十分简陋，把宿舍一律修建成鸽子笼一样，按照这样的作法推广下去，城市里就不必有公园和广场，文学艺术也都成了奢侈品，应该一概取消了。鲁迅先生把这类小事提到和时代精神和民族的未来有关来谈，不能不说他很有见地。应该说，这种苟且草率的作法是和我们今天的时代精神不合的，而且也是违背了我们民族的优良的传统的。
