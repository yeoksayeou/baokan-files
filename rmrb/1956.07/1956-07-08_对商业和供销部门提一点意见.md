    A Few Suggestions for Commercial and Supply & Marketing Departments
    National People's Congress Representative Zhang Huiting
    I live in Chentun Township, Xinmiao District, Yingshang County, Anhui Province. This year, our cooperatives have developed, and the production enthusiasm of the members is very high; however, their morale has been low recently.

    The reason for the low morale of the members is that the cooperative owes a lot of debt; the members are worried that after the debts are paid off when the income is distributed, they will not receive much grain.

    Since this spring, people have been coming to our cooperative frequently. There are people from department stores, supply and marketing cooperatives, and other commercial units. As soon as they arrive, they promote goods and force credit onto the members. They have given us everything on credit. We have several bicycles, three or four first-aid kits, two clocks, eight gas lamps, two basketballs, two radios, three sewing machines, everything. They also sent some wine, fruit candies, and cigarettes, sneakers, and rubber shoes. We didn’t want them, but I heard other cooperatives did. Our cooperative was established not long ago, and the members' lives are not yet so wealthy. We want to use any money we have on production, and don't want to buy too many consumer goods. But the comrades from the commercial departments insist on giving us credit, and won’t take less. They say, "We are promoting goods to adapt to the high tide of cooperativization. You are a model cooperative. If you don't take credit, how can we promote it!" It's truly difficult to explain. As a result, we took a large amount of credit, and owe a large debt.

    The supply and marketing cooperative also uses this method to promote sales, but on an even larger scale. The supply and marketing cooperative gave our cooperative two rubber-tired carts on credit, each costing 1,200 yuan, with only wheels and axles, nothing else. Not to mention the high price, to use them, we have to install a cart frame, buy leather covers, and spend a lot more money. We don’t have the technical skills to assemble them. And we don’t have animals strong enough to pull them. Because of these things, the four rubber wheels have been left aside ever since they were transported to the cooperative.

    Our cooperative originally had more than ten double-wheeled, double-shared plows. This year, the supply and marketing cooperative gave us forty-eight more on credit, regardless of whether we needed them or not. The members insisted on not taking them, but the cadres of the supply and marketing cooperative said we had arrogant sentiments and resistant thoughts. I reflected the members’ opinions, and the district and county committees also criticized me, saying I was only speaking for the members and that refusing them was a conservative idea. The district head said: If you don’t take them, I can’t complete my task. We had no choice but to take them. As a result, they are all sitting in the houses now, some are in the courtyards, and some have already been damaged. Isn’t this a waste of national steel? Isn’t this increasing the burden on the members?

    The commercial departments have sent us many things we don’t need very much, but the things we need are not supplied. For example, we dug more than a hundred wells this year, but without horse-drawn waterwheels, we can't use them. We are very anxious, but there's nothing we can do. We lack livestock and fertilizer, and they don't come up with more ideas to help. The members need to grind flour, but we lack livestock and people don’t have the time. It would be great if they could lend us some foot-operated mills.

    We welcome the comrades from the commercial departments bringing goods to the cooperative. They work very hard. We also think that the method of giving credit to the members and peasants is good. But the goods are not right. They should understand from the members and peasants what they need, what they don't need, what they need now, and what they will need in the future, and deliver goods according to their needs. That way everyone will be satisfied.

    I would also like to talk about double-wheeled, double-shared plows. The advantage of double-wheeled, double-shared plows is that they plow deep, but they also have disadvantages. First, they are too heavy and inconvenient to use, and they are too strenuous for people. One or two small animals cannot pull them. They need two or three large animals, but there are not many livestock in the countryside now. Second, they are expensive. Even after the price reduction, each one still costs seventy or eighty yuan. Third, they require a lot of manpower. When going to the fields, two people have to carry it, and another person has to lead the livestock. When using the old plows, one person could carry the plow on their back, lead the livestock, and go to the fields. Can the comrades who manufacture new agricultural tools think of ways to improve these shortcomings?

### 对商业和供销部门提一点意见

    对商业和供销部门提一点意见
    全国人民代表大会代表　张会亭
    我住的安徽省颍上县新庙区陈屯乡，今年合作社发展了，社员们的生产积极性非常高；可是最近一个时期情绪又低了。
    社员们情绪低了，是因为社里欠了很多债；社员们担心，分配收益的时候，还了账，就分不到多少粮食了。
    从今年春天，我们社里，经常都有人下来。有百货公司的，有供销合作社的，还有别的商业单位的。他们一来，就推销货物，硬赊给社员。把什么都赊给我们了，自行车有好几辆，保健箱三、四个，座钟两个，汽灯八个，篮球两个，收音机两个，缝纫机三架，什么都有。还送来一些酒，水果糖，纸烟，球鞋，胶鞋，我们没有要，听说别的社要了。我们的社办起来不久，社员的生活还不是那样富裕，有点钱还想用在生产上，不想多买那些消费品。可是商业部门的同志，非赊给不行，少要了都不行。他们说，“我们是适应合作化的高潮来推销货物的，你们又是典型社，你们不赊，怎么能推广！”真是有苦难说。结果赊了一大堆，欠了一大笔账。
    供销合作社也用这种办法来推销，不过来头更大。供销社赊给我们社两辆胶轮大车，每辆一千二百元，光有轮子和轴，别的什么也没有。价钱大不用说，要使用它们，还得装车架，买皮套，再花一大笔钱。没有技术还装配不起来。现在也没有那样好的牲口拉它们。就因为这些，四个胶皮轮子，从运到社里，就一直丢在一边。
    我们社原来有十多部双轮双铧犁，今年，供销社不管我们用得着用不着，又赊给了四十八部。社员们主张不要，供销合作社的干部就说我们有骄傲情绪，有抵触思想。我把社员的意见反映上去，区委、县委也批评，说我光替社员叫，不要就是保守思想。区长说：你们不要，我交不了差。我们只好要了。结果现在也都摆在屋子里，有的放在院子里，有些已经损坏了。这不是白白浪费国家的钢铁么？这不是加重社员的负担么？
    商业部门把我们不太需要的东西送来不少，可是我们需要的东西，却不供给。例如今年打了一百多眼井，没有马拉水车，不能用，我们干着急，没办法。缺牲口，缺肥料，也不给多想些办法。社员吃面要推磨，可是牲口少，人也没有功夫，要是能贷给我们些脚打磨多好。
    商业部门的同志们，带着货物到社里来，这个办法我们欢迎。他们也很辛苦。把货物赊给社员和农民的办法，我们也觉得好。可就是货色不对头。他们应该向社员和农民了解了解，要什么，不要什么，现在要什么，以后要什么，按照需要送货品，那样大家就满意了。
    另外谈谈双轮双铧犁，双轮双铧犁，耕地深，是它的好处，可是也有不好处。一是太重，使用不方便，人太吃力。一两个小牲口拉不动它，需要两三个大牲口拉，可是现在农村里牲口并不多。二是价钱大。现在减了价，每部还要七、八十元。三是费人工。下地的时候，要两个人抬着它，另外还得有一个人牵牲口。用旧犁的时候，一个人背上犁，牵上牲口，就下地了。制造新式农具的同志们，能不能想些办法，把这些缺点改进一下？
