	Hopes Egypt will achieve complete victory

Xinhua News Agency, July 30th: Tass News Agency, Cairo, July 29th: According to newspapers, Sudanese Prime Minister Abdullah Khalil commented on Egypt's decision to nationalize the Suez Canal Company, saying that this is a step in line with Egypt's national interests. The Prime Minister said that everyone hopes that Egypt will achieve complete victory.

When Abdullah Khalil spoke of President Nasser's speech on the talks between Egypt and Sudan on the allocation of Nile water, he said, "We agree with President Nasser's opinion that there is no need for any foreign country to interfere in the issue of water distribution of the Nile between Egypt and Sudan, because it is only a matter for our two countries. We want to solve our own affairs without any foreign interference."

	Libyan Prime Minister Says:
	Egypt's Recovery of the Canal is a Courageous Action

According to Xinhua News Agency, July 30th: Tripoli dispatch: Libyan Prime Minister Mustafa Halim said yesterday that Egypt's nationalization of the Suez Canal Company was a "decisive and courageous step, and we hope it succeeds."

The Prime Minister said: "The purpose of this step is to protect Egypt's interests, and it is purely a domestic matter, because Egypt is an independent country."

He added that he was "surprised to see some Western countries turn this act of national interest into a big problem. President Nasser showed a thorough understanding of the importance of the Suez Canal, so he announced the free passage of the canal, which reassured international public opinion."

He said that the Arab League Secretariat is continuing to contact its member states on the situation of the Suez Canal. He pointed out that this is being done "in order to form a temporary and solid Arab front to cope with all developments."
