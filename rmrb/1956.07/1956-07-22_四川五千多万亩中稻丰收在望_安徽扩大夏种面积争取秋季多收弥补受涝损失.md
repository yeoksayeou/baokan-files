In the earlier-season areas of southern and eastern Sichuan, the medium rice has generally reached the stage of grain filling, and some has already begun to turn yellow. In the western Sichuan plain, the six million mu of rice, has partially headed. If there are no special disasters in the future, the province's rice production is expected to increase by 10%.
    Hefei, July 19 (From Our Newspaper) The planting area of summer crops in Anhui Province has reached more than 60 million mu, accounting for two-thirds of the province's cultivated land. In this year's summer planting, in order to recover the losses in the flood-affected areas, farmers in various places have planted medium rice, summer corn, sorghum, sweet potatoes, soybeans, sesame, peanuts, etc., according to local conditions. In many areas, mixed planting and intercropping methods are widely used in summer planting. The three special districts of Fuyang, Bengbu, and Lu'an have nearly 10 million mu of mixed and intercropped sesame, soybeans, corn and other crops. The two special districts of Bengbu and Lu'an have expanded the rice planting area by more than 2 million mu. Some flood-affected areas are still draining water and replanting at the same time.
