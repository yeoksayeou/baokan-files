    The "Butterfly Lovers" That Sends Shivers Down the Spine
    Before National Day last year, one day, my child came back from school and told me: "We third graders are performing 'Farewell at the Pavilion,' the teacher told me to be the pageboy, just running after people, I'm not happy!" At the time, I really didn't know how to answer her. Not long after, I saw "Reunion at the Tower" at a performance at Yancheng Women's Elementary School. Art should always evoke moving memories, but I'm really afraid to think about this scene. -- An eleven or twelve-year-old child, playing a half-dead Liang Shanbo, sits droopily on a stool, another little Zhu Yingtai kneels at his feet and cries "Brother Liang, I miss you..." -- Unexpectedly, today my child told me again: "We third graders are going to perform Liang Shanbo and Zhu Yingtai again to celebrate Children's Day." Seeing her excited expression, I couldn't help but shudder...
    I would like to ask the teachers and counselors, when you choose literary and artistic programs for children, do you consider the purpose of education and the characteristics of children's psychological development? Wang Wensun

    使人打寒噤的“梁祝”
    去年国庆前，有一天，我的孩子从学校中回来，告诉我：“我们三年级演‘十八相送’，老师教我做书僮，光是跟在人后头跑，我不高兴！”当时我真不知怎样回答她好。不久，我在盐城女子小学的文娱会上又看到了“楼台会”。艺术本来应该经常引起动人的回忆的，可是我真怕想这一幕戏。——一个十一、二岁的孩子，装上半死半活的梁山伯，垂头坐在凳子上，另一个小祝英台跪在他的脚下哭“梁哥哥啊我想你……”——想不到今天我的孩子又告诉我：“我们三年级又要演梁山伯祝英台了，庆祝儿童节。”看她那兴高彩烈的表情，我不禁打了个寒噤……
    我想问问教师和辅导员们，当你们为儿童选择文艺节目的时候，是不是考虑到教育的目的和儿童心理发展的特征？　　　王文荪
