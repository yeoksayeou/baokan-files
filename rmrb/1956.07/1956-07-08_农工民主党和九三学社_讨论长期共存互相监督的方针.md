Xinhua News Agency, July 7th:

The Central Committee of the China Democratic National Construction Association held a forum from the 3rd to the 7th to discuss the policy of long-term coexistence and mutual supervision between the Chinese Communist Party and the democratic parties, as proposed by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China.

Participants in the meeting all agreed that the policy proposed by the CPC Central Committee was correct and timely. This policy clarified the direction for the democratic parties. Han Zhuoru and Wang Yifan hoped that this policy of the CPC Central Committee would be well publicized in the future. Wang Yifan believed that to achieve long-term coexistence and mutual supervision, on the one hand, the Communist Party should strengthen its leadership and assistance to the democratic parties, and on the other hand, the democratic parties themselves should also strengthen their work and unity.

The forum also made frank criticisms of the shortcomings in the United Front work of the Communist Party of China. Zhang Yunchuan and Wang Yifan believed that the liaison between the United Front Work Department of the Chinese Communist Party and the members of the democratic parties was not broad enough. Wang Shenlin believed that there were too few cadres in the United Front Work Department of the CPC Central Committee, and they were too busy, so the contact with the members of the democratic parties was relatively narrow. He suggested that the United Front Work Department could consider increasing personnel in the future to strengthen contact with members of the democratic parties. Huang Xianfan also criticized the phenomenon of some local administrative organs, the United Front Work Department of the CPC, and CPC members not showing enough respect for democratic figures. Li Boqiu believed that the past shortcomings in the United Front work of the CPC had its historical conditions, and he hoped that these shortcomings would be improved in the future. He also believed that the multi-party system of socialism should be theoretically clarified so that the people would pay attention to it. He criticized the fact that members of democratic parties had not been bold enough in expressing their opinions in the past.

Zhang Bojun, Chairman of the China Democratic National Construction Association, expressed his views at the forum on the role of the National People's Congress and the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference in China's political life. He also pointed out that after the policy of long-term coexistence and mutual supervision between the Communist Party of China and the democratic parties was put forward, the help and leadership of the Communist Party of China to the democratic parties should not be weakened, but should be strengthened. He also believed that socialist competition could be carried out among the democratic parties in their work. Li Boqiu expressed the same view in his speech.

The forum also exchanged views on issues such as the peaceful liberation of Taiwan and the organizational work of the China Democratic National Construction Association.

Xinhua News Agency, July 7th: The Standing Committee of the Central Committee of the Jiusan Society, during and after the Third Session of the First National People's Congress, successively convened standing committee members in Beijing, members of the society who were deputies to the National People's Congress, and heads of some local organizations to hold forums to exchange opinions on the policy of long-term coexistence and mutual supervision between the Communist Party of China and the democratic parties.

Xu Deheng, Chairman of the Jiusan Society, first pointed out in his speech: Minister Li Weihan's proposal on behalf of the CPC Central Committee at the Third Session of the First National People's Congress on the policy of long-term coexistence and mutual supervision between the Communist Party and the democratic parties is of great significance. He said: After this policy is put forward, we should consolidate and develop the organization of the society, expand contacts with the masses, and further strengthen and do our work well.

All participants in the forum expressed great excitement about this policy of the CPC Central Committee. Zhou Peiyuan said: The policy of the CPC Central Committee is not only an encouragement to us, but also a spur to us. Members of democratic parties should continue to study Marxism-Leninism, study and correctly understand the party's policies, and contribute their strength better in different positions.

Zhang Bosheng emphasized: One of the keys to the continuous victory of the revolutionary cause led by the Communist Party of China is to closely link with the masses and rely on the masses. The masses contacted by the democratic parties include the progressive, the middle-of-the-road, and the backward, and the latter two account for a larger proportion. The opinions of these masses are indispensable when formulating national policies and laws. Timely reflecting their opinions to the Communist Party of China and the government can avoid the drawbacks of biased listening and belief, and make the work better and reduce mistakes.

Wang Huaichen said: The Communist Party of China has high expectations for the democratic parties, and now it has clearly put forward the policy of long-term coexistence and mutual supervision between the Communist Party and the democratic parties, first of all, the policy of supervising the Communist Party, is another declaration of democratic cooperation with non-party people, and is a "fixed and unswerving" and "forever unchanged" policy of the Communist Party, which greatly moved us. We should further do our work well.

    农工民主党和九三学社
    讨论长期共存互相监督的方针
    据新华社7日讯　中国农工民主党中央委员会从三日到七日举行座谈会，讨论中共中央提出的中国共产党和民主党派长期共存、互相监督的方针。
    参加会议的人都认为，中共中央提出的这个方针是正确的、及时的。这个方针使民主党派明确了自己的方向。韩卓儒和王一帆希望今后对中共中央的这一方针要很好地宣传。王一帆认为要做到长期共存、互相监督，一方面共产党要加强对民主党派的领导和帮助，同时民主党派本身也要加强工作、加强团结。
    座谈会还对中国共产党统一战线工作中的缺点进行了坦率的批评。张云川、王一帆认为，中国共产党统一战线工作部门和民主党派成员的联系面还不广。王深林认为中共中央统战部的干部太少，忙不过来，因此和民主党派的联系面就比较窄。他建议统战部今后可考虑增加人员，加强同民主党派成员的联系。黄现璠还对某些地方行政机关、中共统一战线工作部门和中共党员对民主人士尊重不够的现象提出了批评。李伯球认为，中共统一战线工作中过去存在的某些缺点有它的历史条件，今后希望改进这些缺点。他还认为社会主义的多党制应作理论上的阐明，使人民群众重视。他对民主党派成员过去提意见不够大胆提出了批评。
    中国农工民主党主席章伯钧在座谈会上对全国人民代表大会和中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会这两个机关在我国政治生活中的作用发表了自己的看法。他还指出，中国共产党和民主党派长期共存、互相监督的方针提出以后，中国共产党对民主党派的帮助和领导不是应该削弱，而是应该加强。他还认为各民主党派之间在工作上可以进行社会主义竞赛。李伯球在发言中对这一点也表示了相同的看法。
    座谈会还对和平解放台湾和中国农工民主党的组织工作等问题交换了意见。
    据新华社7日讯　九三学社中央常务委员会在第一届全国人民代表大会第三次会议期间和闭会以后，连续召集在京的中央常务委员和担任全国人民代表大会代表的社员和部分地方组织负责人举行座谈会，交换对于中国共产党和民主党派长期共存、互相监督方针的意见。
    九三学社主席许德珩在讲话中首先指出：李维汉部长在第一届全国人民代表大会第三次会议上代表中共中央提出共产党和各民主党派长期共同存在、互相监督的方针，是有重要意义的。他说：这个方针提出以后，我们更要巩固和发展社的组织，扩大与群众的联系，进一步加强和做好我们的工作。
    所有参加座谈会的人对中共中央的这一方针都表示极大的兴奋。周培源说：中共中央的这一方针不但是对我们的一种鼓舞，也是对我们的一种鞭策。民主党派的成员要继续努力学习马克思列宁主义，学习并正确体会党的政策，在不同的岗位更好地贡献自己的力量。
    张伯声强调指出：中国共产党所领导的革命事业之所以不断地取得胜利，关键之一就是密切联系群众，依靠群众。民主党派联系的群众，进步的、中间的、落后的都有，而以后面两种人较多，这些群众的意见，也是制定国家政策法令时所不可缺少的。把他们的意见及时反映给中国共产党和政府，就可以避免发生偏听偏信的弊病，而使工作做得更好，少犯错误。
    王怀琛说：中国共产党对民主党派的期望很殷切，现在又明确地提出共产党和各民主党派长期共存、互相监督，首先是对共产党起监督作用的方针，是再一次宣告了同党外人士实行民主合作，是共产党的一条“固定不移”和“永远不变”的方针，使我们受到很大的感动，我们应该进一步做好我们的工作。
