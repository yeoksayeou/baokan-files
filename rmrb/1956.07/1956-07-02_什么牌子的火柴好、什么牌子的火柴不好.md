Product Quality Review

	Which Brands of Matches are Good, Which Brands are Bad
	★ Happiness brand matches from Shanghai Da Zhonghua Match Company, Phoenix brand matches from Shanghai Huaguang Match Factory, and Lantern brand matches from Tianjin Danhua Match Company are all products of good quality. In particular, the windproof matches recently successfully trial-produced by some match factories in Tianjin and Shanghai can be used as usual on the windy seas and in the mountains, providing great convenience to field and marine workers.
	★ The Hankou brand matches produced by Wuhan Suihua Match Factory have always been of very poor quality. Not only is the number of matches per box short and there are many defective matches, but also the ignition power and moisture resistance are very weak, making them difficult to light. A spot check of 11,000 pieces of Hankou brand matches by the Hubei Provincial Department of Industry found 6,000 pieces of substandard products.
	★ The Parrot brand matches produced by Beijing Match Factory were of very good quality when they were first produced, but since last year, the quality has declined. The match heads are loose, the moisture resistance is poor, the number of matches is uneven, and there are many defective matches.

    什么牌子的火柴好、什么牌子的火柴不好
    ★上海大中华火柴公司的幸福牌火柴，上海华光火柴厂的凤凰牌火柴，天津丹华火柴公司灯笼牌火柴都是质量较好的产品。特别是最近天津和上海一些火柴厂试制成功的防风火柴，在多风的海洋上和山野里同样照常使用，给野外和海洋工作者以很大便利。
    ★武汉市燧华火柴厂出产的汉口牌火柴，质量一直都很坏。不仅装盒支数短少，废支多，而且引梗力和抗潮力都很弱，不易燃着。湖北省工业厅抽查了一万一千件汉口牌火柴就发现有六千件次品。
    ★北京市火柴厂出产的鹦鹉牌火柴，初生产时质量很好，但从去年以来，质量下降，火柴头酥松，抗潮力差，支数不均匀，废支也很多。
