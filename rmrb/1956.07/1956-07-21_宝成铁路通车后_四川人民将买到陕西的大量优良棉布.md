    After the Opening of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway, Sichuan People Will Be Able to Buy a Large Quantity of High-Quality Shaanxi Cotton Cloth
    (Our Newspaper's Report) The Baoji-Chengdu Railway, connecting the Southwest and Northwest, will soon be open to traffic. The Xi'an Purchasing and Supplying Station of the China Textile Company is preparing to supply a large quantity of white cloth, colored cloth, and printed cloth produced by textile printing and dyeing workers in the Shaanxi area to farmers in various parts of Sichuan through the Baoji-Chengdu Railway in the second half of this year.
    The variety of cotton cloth that the Xi'an Purchasing and Supplying Station will supply to Sichuan in the second half of this year will not only increase in variety, but also greatly increase in quantity. For example, the amount of white cloth transferred to Sichuan Province in the first half of the year was more than 71,000 bolts, and it will increase to more than 330,000 bolts in the second half of the year. The increase in colored cloth is even greater. The station did not supply Sichuan Province with floral drill, work cloth, etc. in the first half of the year, but will transfer more than 60,000 bolts in the second half of the year.
    At present, the Xi'an Purchasing and Supplying Station of the Textile Company has begun to transfer cotton cloth to Sichuan Province. More than 50 tons of floral drill, An'an blue, sulfurized blue cloth, work cloth, etc. shipped to Sichuan Province in early July, and about 100 tons of white cloth will be shipped out in July. In order to better meet the consumption needs of the people in various parts of Sichuan, the Xi'an Purchasing and Supplying Station of the Textile Company sent cadres in mid-June, bringing a large number of samples of colored cloth to the Sichuan Provincial Textile Company for exhibition, soliciting opinions, and understanding the local people's needs and opinions on Shaanxi cotton cloth in order to do a good job in supply.

    宝成铁路通车后
    四川人民将买到陕西的大量优良棉布
    本报讯　贯通西南、西北的宝成铁路不久就要通车，中国纺织品公司西安采购供应站准备把陕西地区纺织印染工人生产的白布、色布和花布，在今年下半年通过宝成铁路大量供应四川各地农民。
    西安采购供应站今年下半年供应四川的棉布不但品种增加了，数量也增加很多。例如上半年调给四川省的白布是七万一千多匹，下半年将增加到三十三万多匹。色布增加得更多。上半年这个站没有给四川省供应过的花哔叽、劳动布等，下半年将调给六万多匹。
    目前，纺织品公司西安采购供应站已经开始向四川省调运棉布。七月上旬调往四川省的花哔叽、安安蓝、硫化蓝布、劳动布等将有五十多吨，七月份调出的白布约有一百吨。为了更好地满足四川各地人民消费的需要，纺织品公司西安采购供应站已在六月中旬派出干部，带了大批花色布样品，到四川省纺织品公司进行展览，征求意见，了解当地人民对陕西棉布的需要量和意见，以便做好供应工作。
