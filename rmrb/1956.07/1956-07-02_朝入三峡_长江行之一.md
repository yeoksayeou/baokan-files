Entering the Three Gorges at Dawn
Part 1 of A Yangtze River Journey
By Fang Ji, Special Correspondent for this Newspaper

The boat set sail from Yichang at 4:30 AM. When I woke up, it was already past 5:00 AM. I rushed to the bridge without even washing my face.

I don’t know if it was due to the various images I had of the Three Gorges, or the dawn scenery at that moment, but as soon as I stepped onto the bridge, I immediately felt that the scenery was completely different. The magnificent scene of "stars drooping over the vast plain, the moon surging in the great river" when the ship passed Dongting Lake last night had completely disappeared! All that was before me were: mountains like screens, towering cliffs, and the gorge wind carrying the river water, rushing towards me. For a moment, I didn't know where the wind came from or where the water originated! Did the water flow and the wind rise, or did the wind move and the water surge? I only felt that my eyes were blocked by cliffs, and my ears were filled with the roar of the water and the howling of the wind! Sailing in the gorge, I almost felt like I was at the bottom of the sea!

But this was only the feeling of the first moment. After a while, the situation changed drastically. I only felt the ship trembling, like a car climbing a hill, slowly moving forward. The wind seemed to have stopped, not blowing, but panting; the water also seemed to be still, not flowing, but rolling! Looking into the distance, the morning light was penetrating into the gorge from the top of the towering peaks. The dawn shone, the sky was clear, like a piece of blue brocade, reflecting on the river surface. At this time, I felt that the water was as smooth as a mirror, the wind passed like a stream, and sailing in the gorge was like boating on a lake!

At first, I thought that this change in feeling when entering the Three Gorges was just due to my own imagination. Later, I remembered Su Shi's "First Passing Qutang," which also had a similar description:

	Entering the gorge, there is no road at first, the continuous mountains suddenly resemble niches;
	The winding path collects the vastness, shrinking it into deep pools;
	The wind passes like breathing, the clouds rise like exhaling.

These descriptions are indeed very true to the mountains and rivers of the Three Gorges. Words like "winding," "shrinking," "breathing," and "exhaling" are obscure yet appropriate, and cannot be imagined without visiting the Three Gorges.

At this moment, the captain walked into the bridge, looked at the sky, and said:

"It's getting light so quickly!"

Sure enough, after passing a towering cliff like a screen facing us, the glow of the morning sun penetrated the thin mist floating on the mountainside, casting a cluster of rose-colored light.

I asked the captain: "Have we reached Nanjin Pass yet?"

"It's right in front of us."

He replied calmly. But when I heard it, I was as happy as if I had reached the end of the journey. Nanjin Pass, this is exactly what I wanted to see! This geographical term, which is not yet well-known, may one day shock the world and become the general hub for controlling the Yangtze River floods, illuminating most of China's power base. ... I don't know why, but at this moment I suddenly thought of Du Fu's "Many waters meet at Fuwan, Qutang contends for a single gate," what a vivid and powerful poem! But after a thousand years, this place will be "Three Gorges becoming a sea, many waters crossing Nanjin."

In the clear glow of the morning sun, I saw the steep peaks on both sides, which made this place just like the bottleneck of the Yangtze River. As long as a dam is built, the Yangtze River flood can be completely contained. How many people are working and thinking for this great ideal!

With excitement and anticipation, I walked through Nanjin Pass. Recalling the conversations in Wuhan, the future scenes of the Three Gorges kept flashing in my mind. Obviously, the problems that the engineers were thinking about day and night, their joy and suffering, also infected me.

"What about Huangniu?" I asked the captain again, starting to think about other things.

"We've passed it!" He sighed, as if he had just put down a heavy load. "Just now, the car reached seven hundred and two, that was climbing the hill!"

Only then did I realize that the quiet feeling just now was not entirely out of imagination. Although I am now on a ship, I still experienced the feeling of "early ascent to Huangniu"; even if it was only for a short moment, it seemed to be worth the "three mornings and three evenings" (note) of the ancients.

Then, the sun shone on the bow of the ship. It was morning, but the sun gave people a feeling of dusk. Looking at the compass, I realized that the ship was turning north, and the sun was coming from the right.

The thin mist floating on the mountainside had risen to the top of the mountain, the sunlight filled the valley, and the river and cliffs were all dyed an orange-red color. It turned out that the towering mountains on both sides were like being cut off by a large axe at the place where the Yangtze River passed, inserting into the water and connecting to the sky, straight up and down! The rolling river waves, like pouring out from the mountainside, collided left and right in the deep mountain valleys, scrambling to escape, truly becoming the so-called "river water flowing horizontally"! In addition, shoals and reefs obstructed the river's heart, causing the water to boil and forming countless whirlpools; the small ones were only a foot in diameter, and the large ones could be a foot in diameter, shaped like funnels, with no bottom in sight. Even thousand-ton ships must navigate around them!

After passing Maoping, Taiping Stream, and Meiren Tuo, the mountain slopes eased slightly, and the stones were stacked in layers. This is the Huagang gneiss, which is geologically known as the Huangling Great Anticline. Here, it is also one of the ideal Three Gorges hubs. At this time, there were drilling rigs standing on the river and on the shore, and the small triangular red flags on the drilling rigs fluttered in the morning light. ... It seemed that just this small triangular red flag added infinite vitality to this deep mountain valley and rolling river.

On the stern of the drilling boat in the heart of the river, a young drilling team member was doing morning exercises facing the morning sun. I imagined - maybe it is the labor of this energetic young man that will soon start a great project here, tens of thousands of people will come to the Three Gorges, build a dam across the river, climb ship locks, and huge power stations.

How many poets have praised the Three Gorges since ancient times! They praised the great rivers and mountains of the motherland, praised the hard-working and indomitable people here, and praised the beautiful legends and heroic stories here! However, today is different. What should be praised even more is the modern era! Modern people, modern life, modern builders, and the magical power of science!

All day long, I walked through the Three Gorges with excited imagination, and also browsed the scenery and historical sites in the Three Gorges - such as Zhaojun Village, Nvxu Tomb, Qu Yuan Temple, Goddess Temple, Baidi City, and so on. However, all of this was eclipsed by the towering drilling rig, the red flag fluttering in the wind on the drilling rig, and the image of the young man doing morning exercises on the drilling boat. In my impression, these have become the most important characteristics of the Three Gorges, making the Three Gorges a lively and bright force. ...

(Note) Huangniu, a mountain name, is located in Yichang, Hubei Province. The mountain is very high and faces a very curved section of the Yangtze River. Therefore, when going upstream, the ship can still see this mountain after traveling for several days. Therefore, there is a saying that "departing from Huangniu in the morning, sleeping at Huangniu in the evening, three mornings and three evenings, Huangniu remains the same." (Attached picture)

    朝入三峡
    长江行之一
    本报特约记者  方纪
    晨四时半，船由宜昌启碇了。等我醒来，已过五时；于是脸也来不及洗，就跑上驾驶台去。
    不知道是由于对三峡的各种想像，还是这一时的黎明景色所致，一登上驾驶台，立刻觉得风光迥异，昨晚船过洞庭时的那种“星垂平野阔，月涌大江流”的壮阔景象，竟丝毫不留一点痕迹！眼前只是：群山如屏，峭壁遮天，峡风挟着江水，迎面涌来。一时不知风生何处，水自何来！是水流而风生呢，还是风动而水涌？只觉得眼前是绝壁障眼，耳边是水吼风号！船行峡中，几疑是身置海底！
    但这还只是最初一霎那的感觉。稍过之后，又情景大异，只觉船身颤动，如汽车爬坡，缓缓而行。风好像停了，不是吹，而是喘息；水也好像静止，不是流，而是滚动！抬眼远望，晨曦正从接天高峰的顶上，透入峡中。曙光照耀，天空明净，好像一匹青色素锦，映入江面。这时，又觉水平如镜，风过如流，船行峡中，又像是荡舟湖上！
    初入三峡的这种感觉变幻，起初我原以为只是自己的想像所致。后来记起苏轼的“初过瞿塘”，也有类似的描写：
        入峡初无路，连山忽似龛；
        萦纡收浩渺，蹙缩作潭渊；
        风过如呼吸，云生似吐含。
    这些描写，对于三峡的山水，确实是十分真实的。像“萦纡”、“蹙缩”、“呼吸”、“吐含”之类的冷僻而切当的字眼，不到三峡，是想像不出的。
    这时，船长走进驾驶台来，望望天空说：
    “天亮得好快呀！”
    果然，转过迎面一座插天屏风似的峭壁，霞光透过飘浮在半山的薄雾，投进一团玫瑰色的光辉。
    我问船长：“南津关到了吗？”
    “眼前就是。”
    他回答，说得很平淡。但我听起来，像是到了旅程的终点一样高兴。南津关，这正是我所要看的地方！这个现在还不大为人注意的地理名词，也许有一天会震惊世界，成为控制长江洪水的总枢纽，照亮大半个中国的发电基地。……不知怎么，这时我忽然想起了杜甫的“众水会涪万，瞿塘争一门”来，诗写得何等生动，有气魄！但在千年之后，这里却将是“三峡成大海，众水渡南津”了。
    在明净的霞光里，我看到两岸峭立的山峰，使这里正好变成了长江的瓶口。只要放下一座大坝，长江洪水便可尽入囊中了。为了这个伟大理想，目前多少人为它工作着，思索着呵！
    怀着兴奋和期待的心情，我走过了南津关。回忆着在武汉的谈话，未来的三峡景象，不断地在我脑子里闪烁。显然，那些工程师们日夜思索的问题，他们的快乐和苦恼，也感染了我。
    “黄牛呢？”我又问船长，开始想到了另外的事。
    “过来了！”他叹一口气说，像是刚刚放下一件重活。“刚才车开到七百二，就是爬坡呀！”
    这时我才明白，原来方才的那一阵宁静感觉，并不是完全出于想像。虽然现在坐的是轮船，“早登黄牛”的感觉也还是体会到了；那怕是短短的一霎那，似乎也抵得上古人的“三朝三暮”（注）了。
    接着，阳光照到船头。时间是早晨，但这太阳却给人一种夕暮的感觉。看看罗盘，方知道船向北拐，阳光是从右面来的。
    浮在半山的薄雾，已升到山头，阳光充满峡谷，江流和峭壁，都染上了一种橙红色的光彩。原来两岸的崇山峻岭，在长江过处，俱如大斧劈断一样，插水接天，直上直下！滚滚江涛，像由半山倾泻出来，在深山峡谷中左冲右撞，夺路而走，真成了所谓“江水横流”！加以碛滩礁石，横梗江心，使水流如沸，激成无数漩涡；其中小者盈尺，大可径丈，状如漏斗，深不见底，虽是千吨轮船，也必须绕它而行！
    船过茅坪，太平溪，美人沱，山势稍缓，石呈叠状，这便是在地质上称为黄陵大背斜的华岗片麻岩了。在这里，也正是理想的三峡枢纽之一。此时江中岸上，均有钻机耸立，钻机上的小小三角红旗，在晨光中迎风招展。……仿佛只这一面小小的三角红旗，便为这深山峡谷，滚滚江流，增加了无限生动景气。
    在江心钻探船的船尾上，正有一个年青的钻探队员，迎着朝阳做早操。我想像——也许就是这个充满朝气的年青人的劳动，不久，会在这里开始伟大的工程，成千上万的人来到三峡，在这里筑起拦江大坝，登山船闸，和巨大的电站。
    古往今来，有多少诗人歌颂过三峡呵！他们歌颂了祖国的伟大山河，歌颂了这里坚苦卓绝的人民，歌颂了这里的美丽传说和英雄故事！然而，如今不同了。更应该歌颂的是现代！现代的人民，现代的生活，现代的建设者和科学的神奇的力量！
    一整天，我带着激越的想像走过了三峡，也浏览了三峡中的风景和古迹名胜——如像昭君村，女媭墓，屈原祠，神女庙，白帝城，等等。然而这一切，都因为那高耸的钻机，钻机上迎风招展的红旗，和那站在钻探船上做早操的年青人的形象，而显得黯然失色了。在我的印象中，这些已成了三峡的最主要的特征，使三峡变得生动而光明起来的力量。……
    （注）黄牛，山名，在湖北宜昌境内，山势甚高，又面临长江极弯曲的一段，因而逆水上行的时候，船行数日，还能看见此山。故有“朝发黄牛、暮宿黄牛，三朝三暮、黄牛如故”之说。（附图片）
