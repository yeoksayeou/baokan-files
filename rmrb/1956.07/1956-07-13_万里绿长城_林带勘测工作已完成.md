Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, 12th -- The survey work for the "Great Green Wall" forest belt, which is to be built outside Jiayuguan in Gansu Province, has been completed. From late May to early July, the seven survey teams responsible for this work conducted a thorough survey between Jiayuguan in the east and Xingxing Gorge, where Gansu borders Xinjiang, in the west. According to the survey, the main forest belt, which will shield the agricultural areas of the Hexi Corridor, will be 408 kilometers long. In addition, 17 branch forest belts with a total length of 450 kilometers will be built. According to the wind direction and the direction of desert movement, the main forest belt will extend from east to west from Jiayuguan through the three counties of Yumen, Anxi, and Dunhuang to the Xinjiang border. The 17 branch forest belts will run from south to north, perpendicular to the main forest belt.
    After the forest belts are built, several million mu of farmland and tens of millions of mu of reclaimable wasteland outside Jiayuguan in the Hexi Corridor will be surrounded by the forest belts, isolated from the vast deserts and Gobi.

    “万里绿长城”林带勘测工作已完成
    新华社兰州12日电　甘肃省嘉峪关外准备营造“万里绿长城”林带的勘测工作已经完成了。从五月下旬到七月初，担任这一工作的七个勘测队，在东起嘉峪关西到甘肃和新疆交界的星星峡之间作了周密的勘测。根据勘测，屏蔽河西走廊农业地区的基干林带将长达四百零八公里，另外还要营造总长四百五十公里的十七条支干林带。按照风向和沙漠移动方向，基干林带从东到西将由嘉峪关经玉门、安西、敦煌三县延伸到新疆边境。十七条支干林带从南到北将与基干林带成垂直。
    在林带营造之后，河西走廊嘉峪关外地区的几百万亩农田和上千万亩可垦荒地便将被林带环抱起来，同大片的沙漠和戈壁隔绝。
