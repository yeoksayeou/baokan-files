Xinhua News Agency, July 10th: According to a Reuters report from Kuala Lumpur, more than 7,000 miners in Perak and Selangor, Federation of Malaya, went on strike on July 9th.

The 18,000 tin miners working in sixty European-owned mines in Malaya held their first Sunday work stoppage on July 8th, as the first step in their "slowdown" work struggle to demand that the capitalists grant them one paid holiday per week.

The Malayan Miners' Federation had requested that the capitalists suspend the leave registration system while their current struggle to stop all work on Sundays continues. However, the capitalists treated the workers as being on leave according to this registration system and refused to give them work on July 9th.

A spokesman for the Malayan Miners' Federation said, "Unless an immediate solution is found, the situation will be out of control and the strike will spread like wildfire."

    马来亚锡矿工人罢工
    争取星期日有工资休假
    据新华社10日电　据路透社从吉隆坡报道，马来亚联合邦霹雳和雪兰峨的矿工共七千多人七月九日举行了罢工。
    在马来亚欧洲人所有的六十个矿场工作的一万八千名锡矿工人在七月八日举行了第一次星期日停工，作为他们要求资方每星期给予一天有工资的假日的“放慢”工作斗争的第一个步骤。
    马来亚矿工联合会曾经要求资方在他们目前每逢星期日停止一切工作的斗争还在继续的时候暂停实行请假登记制度，但是，资方按照这个登记制度把工人们当作请假看待，并且在七月九日拒绝给予工作。
    马来亚矿工联合会的一位发言人说：“除非立即得到解决，局势将会无法控制，罢工将像野火似的蔓延起来。”
