Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, July 19th: The Investigation Committee on Christian Missionary Activities of the government of India's Central Province issued a report in Nagpur on July 17th, recommending restrictions on the large-scale influx and activities of foreign missionaries in India. The report stated, "In the Central Province, the methods of missionary activities in certain areas are obviously serving some political purpose in the Cold War."

Before issuing this report, the committee visited seventy-seven religious centers, contacted eleven thousand three hundred and sixty people, accepted written statements from 375 people, and spoke with villagers from approximately seven hundred villages.

The report pointed out that since the constitution came into effect, the number of personnel from American missionary organizations operating in India has greatly increased due to the deliberate policy of international missionary associations to send missionaries in batches to conduct propaganda through newspapers, films, radio, and television.

The report stated that there are 402 foreign missionaries in the Central Province alone. Their missionary activities undermine the unity of non-Christian societies, convert large numbers of tribal and indigenous people with ulterior motives, and pose a danger to national security.

The report said that schools, hospitals, and orphanages are being used as a means of proselytizing, and the report recommends enacting laws to prohibit the use of medical or other social services as a means of converting people.

The report said that using the poverty and suffering of the people as a means of increasing the number of believers is "interfering in India's internal affairs and is contrary to the principles of Panchsheel." The committee believes that these missionary activities in India are not religiously motivated but are "part of a monolithic world policy to restore Christian power to rebuild Western hegemony."

The report also stated that many missionaries in India received a total of over 290 million rupees from foreign countries for missionary activities in the three and a half years before June 1954, including 241.821 million rupees from the United States and other non-sterling areas, and 50.981 million rupees from the United Kingdom and other sterling areas.

The investigation committee recommends expelling foreign missionaries from the Central Province and transferring their property to domestic churches and other organizations. The committee also recommends that Indian Christians establish a unified Christian church in India that is independent of foreign support.

### 外国传教士在印进行阴谋活动  印度中央省调查委员会建议把他们赶走

    外国传教士在印进行阴谋活动
    印度中央省调查委员会建议把他们赶走
    新华社新德里19日电　印度中央省省政府的基督教传教活动调查委员会七月十七日在那格浦尔发表一个报告，建议限制外国传教士大批流入印度和进行活动。报告说，“在中央省，某些地方的传教活动方式显然是为冷战中的某种政治目的服务的”。
    委员会在发表这个报告以前，曾经访问了七十七个宗教中心，同一万一千三百六十人进行了接触，接受了375人的书面声明，同来自约七百个村庄的村民谈过话。
    报告指出，自从宪法生效以来，由于国际传教协会的派遣成批的传教士通过报纸、电影、无线电和电视进行宣传的蓄意的政策，在印度活动的美国传教组织的人员有了很大的增加。
    报告说，单在中央省就有402个外国传教士。他们的传教活动破坏非基督教社会的团结，怀着不可告人的动机使大批部落和土著居民改变宗教信仰，对国家的安全充满着危险。
    报告说，学校、医院和孤儿院都被用来作为劝人改变宗教信仰的一种手段，报告建议通过法律禁止利用医疗或其他社会服务事业作为使人改变宗教信仰的一种手段。
    报告说，利用人民的贫困和痛苦来作为增加教徒的手段是“干涉印度内政，并且是同潘查希拉的原则相抵触的”。委员会认为在印度的这些传教活动并不是出于宗教的动机，而是“为了恢复基督教势力以重建西方霸权的清一色的世界政策的一部分”。
    报告还说，在印度的许多传教士在1954年6月以前的三年半的时间中一共从外国接受了二亿九千多万卢比来进行传教活动，其中从美国和其他非英镑区共接受了二亿四千一百八十二万一千卢比，从英国和其他英镑区接受了五千零九十八万一千卢比。
    调查委员会建议把外国传教士逐出中央省，并且把他们的财产转交给本国的教会和其他团体。委员会还建议由印度基督教会在印度建立一个不受外国支持的统一的基督教会。
