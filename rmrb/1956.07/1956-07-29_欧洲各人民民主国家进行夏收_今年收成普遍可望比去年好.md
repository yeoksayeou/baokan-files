Xinhua News Agency, Prague, July 28th: The European people's democratic countries are carrying out harvesting work. According to reports in these countries' newspapers, this year's harvest in each country is generally expected to be better than last year.

Albania, which started harvesting the earliest, has already harvested more than 90,000 hectares (one hectare equals 15 mu) of winter wheat. Some agricultural production cooperatives have harvested an average of 18 to 20 quintals of wheat per hectare. The harvesting work in Romania is being carried out vigorously, and threshing is now taking place everywhere. Many agricultural production cooperatives have threshed 20 quintals of wheat per hectare. State farms have had particularly good harvests, with some harvesting 25 quintals of barley per hectare. In the central and southern regions of Poland, the harvesting of winter-sown crops began in the first ten days of this month. Bulgaria is currently harvesting wheat. Czechoslovakia is now carrying out harvesting work throughout the country. Hungary is nearing the end of its barley harvesting.

This year's harvest work in these countries is being carried out in the context of the further development of the collectivization movement and a new upsurge in the labor enthusiasm of agricultural workers. At present, 77% of farmers in Bulgaria have joined agricultural production cooperatives. In Czechoslovakia, the socialist component already accounts for 40% of all cultivated land. In the past two months, 3,670 farmers in Hungary have joined cooperatives.

In Poland, the majority of machine tractor stations have launched competitions to make full use of machines and strive for fast and lossless harvesting. Hungary launched a competition to harvest 200 holds (one hold equals 8.55 mu) per combine harvester. The combine harvester operators in Romania proposed an initiative to thresh 20 tons of wheat per day, which has been widely responded to throughout the country. Approximately 300 machine tractor stations in Czechoslovakia have launched competitions to strive for the speedy completion of harvesting work.

The level of mechanization of this year's harvest work in the European people's democratic countries has been greatly improved. In Czechoslovakia, about 90% of the harvesting work of unified agricultural cooperatives is completed by machine tractor stations. In Hungary's state farms and cooperatives, 70% to 90% of the harvesting work is carried out by machines. The number of grain combine harvesters in Poland's machine tractor stations and state farms has nearly doubled in the past year and a half, and the number of harvesters has doubled. More than 70% of the field work in Poland's agricultural production cooperatives has already been mechanized.

    欧洲各人民民主国家进行夏收  
    今年收成普遍可望比去年好
    新华社布拉格28日电　欧洲各人民民主国家正在进行收获工作。据这些国家的报纸报道，今年各个国家的收成普遍可望比去年好。
    开始收获工作最早的阿尔巴尼亚，已经收获了九万多公顷（一公顷合十五市亩）的冬小麦，有些农业生产合作社每公顷平均收获了十八公担到二十公担的小麦。罗马尼亚的收割工作正在大力进行，现在到处都在打麦。许多农业生产合作社每公顷打了二十公担小麦。国营农场的收成特别好，有的每公顷收了二十五公担大麦。波兰中部和南部地区，在这个月的上旬开始了冬播作物的收割工作。保加利亚现在正在收割小麦。捷克斯洛伐克现在全国进行收割工作。匈牙利收割大麦的工作快要结束了。
    这些国家今年的收获工作，是在合作化运动进一步发展，农业工作者的劳动热情有了新的高涨的情况下进行的。现在，保加利亚已经有77％的农户加入了农业生产合作社。在捷克斯洛伐克，社会主义成分已经占有全部耕地的40％。最近两个月来，匈牙利加入合作社的农户就有三千六百七十户。
    在波兰，大多数的机器拖拉机站都展开了充分利用机器、争取又快又无损失地进行收割的竞赛。匈牙利展开了争取每台收获联合机收获二百霍尔德（一霍尔德合八点五五市亩）的竞赛。罗马尼亚的收获联合机手提出了每天打麦二十吨的倡议，在全国得到了广泛的响应。捷克斯洛伐克约有三百个机器拖拉机站展开了争取尽速完成收获工作的竞赛。
    欧洲各人民民主国家今年收获工作的机械化水平大大提高了。捷克斯洛伐克统一农业合作社约有90％的收获工作是由机器拖拉机站来完成。匈牙利国营农场和合作社有70％到90％的收获工作是靠机器进行的。波兰机器拖拉机站和国营农场的谷物收获联合机数量一年来增加了将近一倍半，收割机增加了一倍。波兰农业生产合作社的田间工作有70％以上都已经机械化了。
