    Increased Welfare Facilities in New Residential Areas

    (Our newspaper dispatch) In seventeen new residential areas in the capital, such as Xingfu Alley outside Chaoyangmen and Guanxiang outside Guangqumen, twenty-five municipal and welfare facilities are being added.

    The more than 12,000 rooms managed by the Beijing Municipal Real Estate Administration Bureau are having screens installed in every room. At the doorways of more than 6,000 households, small paths are being paved with paving stones to connect them with the main roads outside. Plumbing workers are busily installing drainage equipment in areas prone to water accumulation, such as Liulijing, Tianning Temple, and Dahongmiao. In addition, workers from the municipal department are also building roads, erecting streetlights, installing telephones, and preparing to develop small parks in the new residential areas.

    In these areas, the relevant departments of the Municipal People's Committee have allocated 107 rooms for the purpose of setting up welfare facilities such as supply and marketing cooperatives, canteens, barbershops, clinics, banks, post offices, and nurseries. As of early July, fourteen welfare facilities have already begun providing services to residents. (Zhou)

    新居民区增建福利设施
    本报讯　在首都朝阳门外幸福巷、广渠门外关厢等十七个新居民区里，正在增建二十五项市政和福利设施。
    北京市房地产管理局管理的一万二千多间房屋，每间屋里都在安装纱窗。六千多户住户的门口，正在用方砖铺成区间小道，以便和外面的大道连结起来。上下水道工人们在琉璃井、天宁寺、大红庙等容易积水的地区，忙碌地安置排水设备。另外，市政部门的工人还正在为新居民区修建道路、架设路灯、安装电话，并准备开辟小型公园。
    在这些地区，市人民委员会有关部门已经拨出107间房屋，用来办供销合作社、食堂、理发馆、诊疗所、银行、邮局和托儿站等福利设施。七月初，已经有十四处福利设施开始为居民服务。　（周）
