    Taiyuan -- The Taiyuan Federation of Trade Unions allocated funds from the trade union labor insurance fund and raised additional funds from the enterprise administration, totaling 588,800 yuan, which has been fully distributed to 17,000 workers with financial difficulties in 120 enterprises in Taiyuan City. This relief effort is the largest scale ever undertaken in Taiyuan. Among the workers who received assistance, 4,950 received an average of 40 yuan each in relief funds. Special consideration was given to workers with particular difficulties. Wang Zangxing, a worker in the Chemical Zone, owed 154 yuan in medical expenses due to his wife's difficult childbirth. He was subsidized 154 yuan this time to help him clear his debts. Lei Yuzhu, a worker at the Taiyuan Flour Mill, owed 340 yuan in foreign debt due to illness. The trade union subsidized 200 yuan based on the specific situation. Yan Chunsheng, a worker at the joint state-private Da Hua Auto Repair Shop, supports a large family with a low wage income and received a 100 yuan subsidy this time. The workers who received assistance were very grateful to the Party and the trade union organizations for their concern, and their production became more active. Ma Zhiwen, a lathe operator in the metalworking workshop of the Shanxi Machinery Factory, broke the quota by two to three times for three consecutive days after receiving assistance. Guo Xiu'e, a carding worker in the coarse spinning workshop of the Jinsheng Textile Factory, has recently become an advanced producer in the factory due to the stimulation of her production enthusiasm after receiving assistance.
