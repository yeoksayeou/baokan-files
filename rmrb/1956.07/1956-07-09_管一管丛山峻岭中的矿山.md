    Manage the Mines in the Deep Mountains
    Hou Bingheng

    Recently, I accompanied the industrial production inspection team organized by the Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China to six mines in Funan, Fudong, Yugan, Chenwan, Sanbaopeng, and Lilinli, which are the production areas of porcelain clay, a raw material for the porcelain industry in Jingdezhen. These mines are distributed in the deep mountains and ridges of northeastern Jiangxi.

    Here, the methods of mining and crushing ore are still very old. The roadways of many mines are winding, uneven, and the pit props are haphazardly supported. There is not a single flat walkway. Miners climb up and down, which is extremely unsafe. Some workers work on ladders as high as fifteen meters underground, without safety protection equipment. Oil lamps are used for lighting underground, with heavy smoke and poor ventilation. Because the mining methods are backward, the ore extraction rate generally only reaches 40%-60%, and some are even less than 20%. For example, in the Heping mine in Chenwan and the Shizishan mine in Yugan, only three meters are mined in a ten-meter-wide vein, and the remaining seven meters cannot be mined because there are no safety devices.

    In terms of employee welfare, except for the Funan mine, the conditions in other mines are very poor. Each mine has dozens or hundreds of workers living in leaky, drafty, sunless, and very damp thatched sheds. Family dormitories are even more rudimentary, with some families and single workers living together. Other basic welfare services such as bathing, haircuts, and entertainment are not available. Some commercial departments even transport rotten fish and meat that cannot be sold in the towns to the mountainous areas to sell to the workers. The 600-plus workers in the Fudong mine only bought 180 jin of fresh pork during the Spring Festival, and the 170 workers in the Chenwan mine only bought 160 jin of fresh pork during the Spring Festival, and fresh pork is not available at all at other times. The Yaoli Township Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Fuliang County does not even sell tofu to the workers. As for the political, cultural, and technical studies of employees, no one cares about them.

    These problems have not been reasonably resolved for several years. The Jiangxi Provincial Department of Industry and the Shangrao Prefectural Industrial Section simply do not pay attention to the industrial and mining enterprises in the mountainous areas. They rarely send people to understand and inspect the work, and they rarely ask the leaders of the industrial and mining enterprises there to report, understand their difficulties, and help them solve problems. Although the industrial and mining enterprises in the mountainous areas are small, scattered, and technologically backward, they are a part of the local industry. Some of them serve the industries in large cities and towns, and some serve the local farmers. If their production is not good, it will affect the production of medium and large enterprises related to them, and it will affect the production and life of local farmers. The workers there are also members of the working class and members of the leading class of our country. It is wrong to not care about them, or even not supply them with fresh meat and non-staple foods. I think the eyes of the local industrial leading organs and the local Party organizations should often look at the production of industrial and mining enterprises in the mountainous areas, and their ears should often listen to the voices of the workers in the mountainous areas.

    管一管丛山峻岭中的矿山
    侯秉衡
    最近我随同中共江西省委组织的工业生产检查组，到景德镇市瓷业原料——瓷土产地浮南、浮东、余干、陈湾、三宝蓬、礼林里等六个矿山去。这些矿山分布在赣东北的丛山峻岭中。
    在这里，开采和粉碎矿石的方法，还是很古老的。许多矿井的巷道弯弯曲曲，高低不平，坑木乱支撑，没有一条平坦的人行道，矿工爬上爬下，极不安全。有些工人在井下高达十五公尺的梯子上作业，也没有安全保护设置。井下用油灯照明，浓烟重重，通风不良。因为开采方式落后，矿石采出率一般只达到40％—60％，有些还不及20％。如陈湾的和平矿井和余干的狮子山矿井，在十公尺宽的矿脉中只开采三公尺，其余的七公尺因为没有安全装置，都不能采。
    在职工生活福利方面，除浮南矿外，其他矿条件都是很差的。每个矿山都有几十名或几百名工人住在漏雨透风、没有阳光、非常潮湿的茅草棚中。家属宿舍更简陋，有些家庭和单身工人混杂一起居住。其他如洗澡、理发、娱乐等等起码的福利事业都没有。有些商业部门竟把城镇销售不了的臭鱼臭肉运到山区卖给工人。浮东矿六百多名工人只在春节的时候才买到一百八十斤鲜猪肉，陈湾矿一百七十名工人也只在春节的时候才买到一百六十斤鲜猪肉，平时根本买不到新鲜猪肉。浮梁县瑶里乡供销合作社连豆腐都不卖给工人。至于职工的政治、文化、技术学习，更是无人过问。
    这些问题已经好几年都没得到合理的解决。江西省工业厅和上饶专署工业科根本不重视山区里的工矿企业，既很少派人去了解检查工作，也很少找那里工矿企业的领导人来汇报，了解他们的困难，帮助他们解决问题。山区工矿企业虽然小、分散、技术落后，但是它们是地方工业的一个组成部分，它们之中有的为大城镇的工业服务，有的为当地农民服务。它们的生产不好，就会影响跟它们有关的中大企业的生产，就会影响当地农民的生产和生活。那里的工人，也是工人阶级的组成部分，是我们国家的领导阶级的一员，不关心他们，甚至不供给他们鲜肉、副食品，是错误的。我认为地方工业领导机关和地方党组织的眼睛要经常看看山区工矿企业的生产，耳朵要经常听听山区工人的呼声。
