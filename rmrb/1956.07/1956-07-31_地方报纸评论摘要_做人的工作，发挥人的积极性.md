Local Newspaper Commentary Summary
    Doing the Work of People, Bringing into Play the Positivity of People

    The Hangzhou Daily of July 21st introduced the experience of the Party General Branch of the Hangzhou Silk Factory in doing the work of people. At the same time, it published an editorial pointing out that the Party organizations in enterprises must understand people, care for people, and do the work of people well in order to bring into play all the positive factors of the workers and masses, and complete the state plan more, faster, better, and more economically. The editorial said that doing the work of people requires figuring out what things are hindering the exertion of people's positivity. This requires leaders to change their floating work style, go deep into the masses to discover problems, expose contradictions, and resolve contradictions with targeted solutions.

    The editorial believes that the work of people should be done comprehensively, regularly, and meticulously. It is necessary to care for workers, as well as technical personnel and staff; to care for relatively backward workers, as well as advanced producers; to care for the general masses of workers, as well as Party members and cadres. A person's life is multifaceted, and the Party organization should understand and care for them from multiple aspects. It is not only necessary to do it comprehensively, but also to do it regularly, and not just in a rush. Some people understand the work of people as merely solving problems in terms of living subsidies, wages, and benefits, which is incomplete. In solving any problem, we must not relax ideological education work.

    地方报纸评论摘要
    做人的工作，发挥人的积极性
    七月二十一日杭州日报介绍了杭州绸厂党总支做人的工作的经验，同时发表社论，指出企业中的党组织要了解人、关心人、做好人的工作，才能发挥职工群众的一切积极因素，又多、又快、又好、又省地完成国家计划。社论说，做人的工作，就要弄清究竟有些什么东西在阻碍人的积极性的发挥。这就要求领导者转变漂浮的工作作风，深入到群众中去发现问题，揭露矛盾，对症下药地解决矛盾。
    社论认为，人的工作要做得全面、经常和细致。既要关心工人，也要关心技术人员和职员；既要关心比较落后的职工，也要关心先进生产者；既要关心一般的职工群众，也要关心党员和干部。一个人的生活又是多方面的，党组织应该从多方面去了解、去关心。不但要做得全面，还要做得经常，不能突击一下就算了。也有人把做人的工作理解为只是解决一些生活补助、工资福利等方面的问题，这是不完整的。在解决任何问题的时候，都不能放松思想教育工作。
