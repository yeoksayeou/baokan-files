Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, July 26th: The U.S. side has continuously violated the Korean Armistice Agreement. From the signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement to July 20th of this year, there have been many instances of the U.S. side violating the armistice agreement. The Korean-Chinese side has lodged protests with the U.S. side through meetings at Panmunjom in 572 cases alone. Since the armistice, the U.S. side has also continuously dispatched armed vessels and special agents in batches to intrude into the waters and land of the Korean-Chinese side to carry out terrorist activities such as massacring, kidnapping, and robbing peaceful residents. By May 1955, more than 700 special agents dispatched by the U.S. side had already been arrested.

The most blatant and shameless manifestation of the U.S. sabotage of the armistice is the recent arbitrary expulsion of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission from South Korea.

    三年来美方不断违反朝鲜停战协定
    新华社平壤26日电　美方不断违反朝鲜停战协定。在从朝鲜停战协定签订到今年七月二十日，美方违反停战协定的事件很多。仅仅由朝中方面通过板门店会议向美方提出抗议的事件就有五百七十二件。从停战以来，美方也不断派遣成批的武装船只和特务潜入朝中方面海面和陆地，进行像屠杀、绑架和抢劫和平居民之类的恐怖活动。到1955年5月，已经逮捕了美方派遣的特务七百多名。
    美方破坏停战的阴谋的最公然无耻的表现，是最近专横地把中立国视察小组逐出南朝鲜。
