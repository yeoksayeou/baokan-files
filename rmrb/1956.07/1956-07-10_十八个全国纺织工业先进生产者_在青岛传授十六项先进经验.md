Xinhua News Agency, Qingdao, July 9th: Eighteen national textile industry advanced producers have concluded their operating demonstrations in Qingdao and departed on the 8th for Dalian to continue sharing their experiences.

From June 29th to July 5th, these advanced producers conducted the first national textile industry advanced experience study class in Qingdao, sharing sixteen advanced operating methods across nine major work types including spinning and weaving. The one hundred and thirty-six students participating in this study class were advanced producers and outstanding workers from state-owned and joint state-private cotton textile factories in Qingdao and Jinan. After this phase of learning, these students generally grasped the skills and characteristics of the advanced experiences according to their work type, essentially meeting the requirements of being able to explain, perform, and teach.

The Qingdao Textile Bureau, the Qingdao Municipal Committee of the Textile Workers' Union of China, and other units have decided to hold a second study class starting from the 10th to continue sharing these advanced experiences.
