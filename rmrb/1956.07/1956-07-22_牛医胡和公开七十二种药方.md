Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, July 18th: Seventy-eight-year-old veterinary doctor Hu He has recently orally dictated all seventy-two prescriptions for cattle diseases that he has acquired in his fifty-eight years of practice. He is a folk veterinarian from Xinhui County, Guangdong Province.

These seventy-two prescriptions for cattle diseases include both internal and external medicine. Hu He's family has been practicing veterinary medicine for three generations, including himself. For the past fifty-eight years, Hu He has treated more than three to four hundred cattle each year, with only one or two not recovering. This year, all of the more than three hundred cattle he has treated have been cured.

This bald-headed veterinary doctor with only a few white whiskers on his chin is very talkative. When talking to reporters about this public release of prescriptions, he said: "I am almost eighty years old, why shouldn't I pass them on!" He pondered for a moment and then said: "However, in the old days, even if I got old, I would only pass them on to my closest relatives!"

    牛医胡和公开七十二种药方
    新华社广州18日电　七十八岁的牛医胡和最近几天已将行医五十八年所得的七十二种牛病药方全部口授出来了。他是广东省新会县的民间兽医。
    这七十二种牛病的药方包括内外两科。胡和的家庭，连他已是三代牛医。五十八年来，胡和每年医的牛总在三四百头以上，医不好的只有一两头；今年来所医的三百多头牛都全部医好。
    这位头已光秃、下巴只有几根白须的牛医非常健谈。和记者讲到这次公开药方时，他说：“我是近八十岁的人了，为什么还不传开！”他沉思了一下又说：“不过，要是在旧日子，就算到老，顶多是传给至亲的人罢了！”
