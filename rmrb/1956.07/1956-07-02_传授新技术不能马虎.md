Opinion from the Countryside:

    Imparting New Technologies Must Not Be Careless
    During this year's spring planting, a small number of technicians in agricultural cooperatives in our Huaiyin Special District adopted a sloppy attitude when using new agricultural technologies. For example, the Mamiao Agricultural Cooperative in the Buzi District of Suqian County wanted to plant a portion of hybrid fields with Golden Queen corn and Erfu Coarse corn. According to the operational methods for implementing the new technology, Golden Queen has a longer growing period and should be sown earlier, while Erfu Coarse has a shorter growing period and should be sown a few days later to facilitate hybridization. However, they sowed both varieties simultaneously on 60 mu. Because the two varieties will not tassel and flower at the same time in the future, it will be impossible to carry out hybridization and achieve the goal of cultivating improved varieties. The first brigade of the Jinxing Second Agricultural Cooperative in the cotton-growing area of Huaiyin County used one jin of ammonium sulfate mixed with 30 jin of water (it should have been mixed with 100 jin of water) to apply top dressing to sweet potato seedlings. Because the concentration of ammonium sulfate was too high, a bed of seedlings withered and scorched in the afternoon after being watered in the morning. The sixth team of the Gonghe Agricultural Cooperative in Wangji District, Siyang County, mixed three liang of 6% DDT powder per mu with millet seeds, exceeding the prescribed amount by two times, which affected seed germination.
    An examination of the reasons reveals that, in most cases, relevant business departments (such as the Agricultural and Forestry Section, Agricultural Technology Extension Station, and Supply and Marketing Cooperative) did not earnestly educate the technicians of the agricultural cooperatives when imparting new technologies, failing to make them deeply aware that adopting new technical operational methods is a meticulous task. In actual operation, one must never be careless or sloppy, otherwise, good things will be turned into bad things.

    传授新技术不能马虎
    在今年春种中，我们淮阴专区少数农业社的技术员，在采用农业新技术的时候，采取了马马虎虎的态度。如宿迁县埠子区马庙农业社要种一部分金皇后玉米和二伏糙玉米的杂交田；按照实施新技术的操作方法，金皇后生长期长，应该提前播种，二伏糙生长期较短，应该迟几天播种，这样才能进行杂交。但是他们却将这两个品种同时播种了60亩。由于将来两个品种不能同时抽穗、开花，根本无法进行杂交，达不到培育良种的目的。淮阴县棉花区金星第二农业社第一大队用硫酸錏一斤兑水三十斤（应该兑水一百斤），给山芋苗施追肥，因为硫酸錏的浓度太大，上午浇下去，下午一床幼苗都枯焦了。泗阳县王集区共和农业社第六队每亩用6％的六六六药粉三两拌谷子，超过规定的份量二倍，结果影响了种籽的发芽。
    检查原因，大部分是因为有关业务部门（如农林科、农业技术推广站、供销合作社）在向农业社传授新技术的时候，没有认真教育农业社的技术员，深刻地认识采用新技术操作方法是件细致的工作，在实际操作中绝不能粗枝大叶、马马虎虎，否则就会把好事做成了坏事。
