    The Great Rembrandt
    The Dutch school of painting is characterized by realism. Several of Rembrandt's masterpieces are preserved in the museums of Amsterdam and The Hague. "Jeremiah Lamenting the Destruction of Jerusalem" depicts the prophet's ecstatic reverie with astonishing realism. "The Night Watch," a painting that was not appreciated by the powerful and wealthy at the time, resulting in the painter's impoverished later years, now hangs in the most important hall of the museum. It is said that people often sit on the benches in this hall and look at it for half a day.
    Next to the canal in the old city of Amsterdam, the painter's residence has been turned into a museum. We were passing by the painter's former residence while it was raining. The profound impression of the "Self-Portrait" seen in the museum, recalling the painter being driven out of this house in his desolate later years, made us feel as if we saw the painter walking alone in the wind and rain.

    On the Streets at Night
    In Amsterdam at night, you sometimes encounter teenagers speaking English with an American accent, mostly around fourteen or fifteen to seventeen or eighteen years old. At first, we didn't pay much attention when we occasionally encountered them once or twice. But later, when we discovered that these young people wearing floral shirts and chewing gum didn't seem like short-term tourists, we couldn't help but inquire about them. It turns out that these American youths are studying in the Netherlands, and some are not in universities but in middle schools. At first, we didn't understand why they would travel across the ocean to study in middle school. After explanation, we learned that it was because prices in the Netherlands were low, and the exchange rate for American money was not low. Therefore, as a Dutch friend said, "Their families can enable their children to live a very good life in the Netherlands with only a small amount of money. If they are wealthy families, these young people can simply live like princes." (Attached picture)

    伟大的伦勃朗
    荷兰画派以写实主义为特点，伦勃朗的几幅名作还保存在阿姆斯特丹和海牙的博物馆中。“耶列米，耶路撒冷的灭亡的哀悼”这幅作品，把这位预言家的出神的遐想描绘得惊人的逼真。当时不为权贵欣赏而造成画家晚年困苦处境的“夜巡”这幅画，现在被挂在博物馆最重要的大厅中，据说，常有人坐在这个大厅的凳子上看上半天。
    在阿姆斯特丹旧城的运河旁，画家的住宅已经辟作博物馆。我们经过画家故居时正下着雨，在博物馆看到的“自画像”的深刻印象，想起画家在他凄凉的晚年被赶出这座房子的情形，使我们好像看见了画家正在风雨中踽踽独行。夜晚的大街上
    在夜晚的阿姆斯特丹，有时会遇见一些讲美国口音的英语的半大孩子，大都是十四五岁到十七八岁的样子。最初偶而遇到一两次还不在意。但后来发现这种穿花衬衫、嚼口香糖的青年不像是短期暂住的游客时，便禁不住要向人们打听一下。原来，这些美国青年是在荷兰读书的，有些并不是在大学而是在中学读书。初听之下很不了然，为甚么读中学还要远渡重洋来留学呢？经过解释才知道，原来因为荷兰的物价便宜，而美国钱汇率倒不算低。因此，正像一位荷兰朋友说的：“他们的家庭只用不多的一些钱便可以使自己的子弟在荷兰过着很不坏的生活。如果是豪富家庭，这些青年简直可以过着王子一样的生活呢。”（附图片）
