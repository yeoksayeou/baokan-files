Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou: Gansu Province and the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region are taking emergency measures to prevent migrants from bringing cotton pink bollworm into the Hexi Corridor cotton-growing area and the Xinjiang cotton-growing area.

The Hexi Corridor cotton-growing area and the Xinjiang cotton-growing area have not previously been found to be infested with pink bollworm, and the cotton produced is of good quality. However, due to the large-scale migration to these areas in recent years, there is a risk of pink bollworm being introduced. According to inspections, pink bollworm has already been introduced into the Hexi Corridor this year.

Recently, Lanzhou has established a quarantine system, and all items carried by migrants to the Hexi Corridor and Xinjiang must be quarantined and disinfected. In early June, plant quarantine authorities in Gansu and Xinjiang also sent cadres to Henan Province to assist the Henan plant quarantine authorities in carrying out pre-departure quarantine and disinfection of migrants' luggage to prevent its spread.

The cotton in the Hexi Corridor is now five to six inches tall, and field spot checks and general surveys have gradually begun; cotton plants found to have pink bollworm are immediately uprooted. In cotton-growing areas with migrants, wettable DDT will also be sprayed universally.

    不让红铃虫进河西走廊
    甘肃新疆采取紧急措施
    据新华社兰州电　甘肃省和新疆维吾尔自治区正采取紧急措施，防止移民把棉花红铃虫传入河西走廊棉区和新疆棉区。
    河西走廊棉区和新疆棉区过去没有发现过红铃虫为害，所产棉花质量很好。但由于近年来开始大量向这些地区移民，有传入红铃虫的危险。据检查，河西走廊今年已经有红铃虫传入。
    最近兰州已经建立了检疫制度，凡到河西走廊和新疆去的移民所携带的东西都要经过检疫和消毒。甘肃和新疆的植物检疫机关六月初还派了干部到河南省，协同河南植物检疫机关对移民的行李实行启程前的检疫和消毒，以免传播。
    现在河西走廊的棉花已有五六寸高，田间抽查和普查工作已逐步开始；凡发现红铃虫的棉田，立即把棉株拔除。在有移民的棉区，还将普遍喷射可湿性滴滴涕。
