    The supply of paper, especially paper for news and publishing, is currently strained. The tension in the supply of news and publishing paper is concentrated in the following figures: According to the planned figures submitted by national news and publishing units, this year a total of 200,000 tons of news and publishing paper are needed, while the paper supply departments can only supply 165,000 tons. In other words, there is a difference of almost one-fifth. Because the paper supply is tight, even the primary and secondary school textbooks, which must be guaranteed to be supplied on time and in sufficient quantities, are printed later this year than in previous years, and it will take great effort to catch up with the needs of the autumn school season.
    In 1955, national news and publishing units used a total of 116,700 tons of paper. The supply figure for this year has increased to 165,000 tons, which can be said to be a considerable increase. So, why is the aforementioned tension still occurring? There are two reasons for this:
    On the one hand, fundamentally, it is that the cultural needs of the people are constantly growing, while China's paper resources are insufficient, and there is a contradiction between the two. It is estimated that this contradiction is only beginning to emerge this year, and with the improvement of people's material lives, the increase in the number of literate people, and the development of cultural and educational undertakings, this contradiction may expand in the longer term in the future. On the other hand, there is serious waste in both news publishing and social paper use, and this is the direct and main reason for the current tight paper supply. Many news, publishing, and book and newspaper distribution units have not conducted a good investigation of the real situation of the people's cultural needs, and regardless of the paper supply capacity, blindly pursue the number of books and periodicals issued, ignoring the actual effect of publicity and education. As a result, some books and periodicals that are truly needed by the masses, such as social science theories, scientific and technological knowledge, teaching reference materials, spare-time school textbooks, and popular literature and art, cannot be supplied in a timely and reasonable manner; while some books and periodicals have serious backlogs, waste, and even disguised apportionment. The latter phenomenon is even more significant in rural areas. For example, from the fourth quarter of last year to the first quarter of this year, six key distribution books were overstocked by more than 15 million copies, exceeding the reasonable reserve, and overstocking more than 1,000 tons of paper; the "Rural Youth" bi-monthly magazine added 700,000 copies from the third quarter of last year to the first quarter of this year, but only 387,000 copies were actually sold, with an overstock of 45%. The phenomenon of meaningless repetition in publications is also very serious. For example, the "Dangerous Route" of the China Youth Publishing House, the "Dangerous Road" of the New Knowledge Publishing House and the Shanghai Culture Publishing House, the "Dangerous Road" of the Shaanxi People's Publishing House, and the "Dangerous Journey" of the Tianjin Popular Publishing House are all different translations of the same work written by the Soviet writer Ardamaatsky. Cutting and pasting to piece together a book, or randomly grabbing a foreign book and translating and publishing it regardless of its value, is a common occurrence. In addition, many internal publications and forms of organs, groups, troops, and enterprises are numerous, and the office paper is unnecessarily excessive, even using Xuan paper and Daolin paper for memo paper, which is also a serious waste.
    To solve the contradiction between paper supply and demand, the fundamental way, of course, is to increase the source of paper. The news and publishing paper supplied by domestic paper production departments in China has increased by an average of more than 27% per year from 1952 to 1956, which is undeniably fast; but in absolute terms, it is still far from the needs of news and publishing paper. Therefore, paper production departments should actively develop the production of machine-made paper, tap potential forces, strive to experiment with the use of various usable raw materials for papermaking, appropriately increase the proportion of news and publishing paper, and constantly improve the quality of paper. At the same time, hand-made paper should also be developed to meet the needs of social paper, so that machine-made paper can relatively increase the supply of news and publishing paper.
    In order to meet the growing cultural demands of the people as much as possible, in addition to actively increasing the source of paper, we should also strengthen the planning of publishing and distribution, and save paper in all aspects, so that limited paper can be used appropriately.
    So, in which aspects should paper be saved?
    First of all, planning should be strengthened in news, publishing, and book and newspaper distribution. This year, the supply of news and publishing paper nationwide is only 165,000 tons. Cultural departments and news, publishing units, and book and newspaper distribution units should arrange their work according to the paper supply situation. This requires adjusting publishing plans and controlling the number and length of some books and periodicals to ensure the supply of primary and secondary school textbooks, literacy textbooks, certain important newspapers and periodicals, and books urgently needed by the people. In the future, all provinces, cities, autonomous regions, and central news and publishing units should formulate publishing plans realistically every year based on the people's purchasing power, the degree of improvement in cultural level, the real need for books and periodicals, and the possible conditions for paper supply and printing strength. After the plan is approved, publishing and distribution should be carried out in accordance with the plan, and the use of paper should be adjusted according to the importance and urgency within the region and unit.
    In order to save news and publishing paper and ensure the planned satisfaction of the people's needs for books and periodicals, newspaper and magazine offices should carefully plan the reasonable number of issues according to the nature of their newspapers and magazines and the readership. The publicity effect of newspapers and magazines is first determined by their quality, and not, as some people imagine, mainly by quantity. Blindly pursuing the quantity of publishing and distribution, and even resorting to disguised apportionment, increasing the burden on the people, is not in line with the healthy development of newspapers and periodicals and the interests of the broad masses of the people. Periodically issued newspapers and periodicals should not arbitrarily increase the length, shorten the publication period, or temporarily increase the circulation significantly. Book publishing houses should strengthen the planning of publishing books, improve the quality of publishing books, try to avoid unnecessary duplication, reduce books with empty content and meaningless words, and should take the initiative to control the number of books printed, and help distribution units avoid overstocking. Book and newspaper distribution units should conduct a good investigation of the needs of the people, especially the needs of farmers, reasonably formulate and control distribution plans, reduce overstocking, prevent waste, and resolutely oppose the method of apportionment. The relevant leading departments at the central and local levels should take saving paper and improving the quality of publishing and distribution as one of the important criteria when reviewing the plans of news, publishing units and book and newspaper distribution units and checking their work.
    The people of the whole country, especially organs, groups, troops, enterprises, and schools that consume more paper, should practice strict economy in paper. All units should implement strict control over various internal publications and rationally adjust the length, publication period, and number of copies printed. Those publications that can be published or not should not be published, and those objects that can be distributed or not should not be distributed. We should try to improve the utilization rate of paper. Whenever low-grade paper can be used, high-grade paper should not be used, and when double-sided use is possible, single-sided use should not be used. Paper for industrial and commercial packaging should also use substitutes or waste paper as much as possible. Schools at all levels should educate students to cherish textbooks, try to keep textbooks clean, and leave them for younger siblings and the next class of students to continue using. In rural areas, when carrying out publicity work, blackboards and broadcasting tubes should be used as much as possible, and large-character posters written on paper should be used as little as possible. In daily work and life, we should pay attention to saving paper, such as reducing unnecessary official documents and forms, using an envelope twice or even three times, etc. As long as everyone pays attention to it, they will come up with more and better ways to save paper. This will not only save paper, but also reduce bureaucracy, improve work efficiency, save state expenses, and cultivate the habit of cherishing materials.

### 从各方面节约纸张

    从各方面节约纸张
    目前纸张的供应，特别是新闻出版用纸的供应出现了紧张的状况。新闻出版用纸供应的紧张，集中表现在下面的数字上：按照全国各新闻出版单位提出的计划数字，今年共需要新闻出版用纸二十万吨，而纸张供应部门却只能供给十六万五千吨。也就是说，相差几乎五分之一。因为纸张供应紧张，连必须保证按时足量供应的中小学课本，今年也印得比往年迟，还需要用很大的努力才能赶上秋季开学的需用。
    1955年全国新闻出版单位共用纸十一万六千七百吨，今年的供应数字增加到十六万五千吨，应该说增加的数量是相当多的。那么，为什么还要出现前面所说的紧张情况呢？这儿有两方面的原因：
    一方面，从根本上说，是人民群众的文化生活需要不断增长，而我国纸张资源不足，两者之间存在着矛盾。估计这种矛盾今年还只是初露苗头，随着人民物质生活的改善，识字人数的增加，文化教育事业的发展，在今后较长时期内，这种矛盾还可能扩大。另一方面，无论新闻出版和社会用纸都有严重的浪费，而且这是造成目前纸张供应紧张的直接的主要的原因。许多新闻、出版单位和书报发行单位没有很好地调查人民群众文化需要的真实情况，也不顾纸张的供应能力，盲目地追求书籍报刊的发行数量，忽略了宣传教育的实际效果。结果有些真正为群众所需要的书刊，如社会科学理论、科学技术知识、教学参考材料、业余学校教材、通俗文学艺术等方面的图书，不能及时地合理地满足供应；而某些图书报刊却出现了严重的积压、浪费、甚至变相摊派。后一种现象在农村中更加显著。例如，去年第四季到今年第一季有六种重点发行的图书，就积存了一千五百多万册，超过了合理的储备量，积压纸张一千多吨；“农村青年”半月刊，从去年第三季到今年第一季加印了七十万册，实际只销出了三十八万七千册，积压了45％。出版物中没有意义的重复现象也很严重。例如中国青年出版社的“危险的航线”、新知识出版社和上海文化出版社的“危险的路”、陕西人民出版社的“危险的道路”、天津通俗出版社的“危险的旅途”都是苏联阿尔达马茨基写的同一著作的不同译本。剪剪贴贴，拼凑成书，或者随便抓到一本外国书籍，不管它的价值怎样就翻译出版，这是一种常见的事。此外，许多机关、团体、部队、企业的内部刊物和表报繁多，办公用纸不必要地过分讲究，甚至用宣纸和道林纸做便条，实在也是严重的浪费。
    要解决纸张供需之间的矛盾，根本的办法当然是增加纸的来源。我国国内纸张生产部门所供应的新闻出版用纸，从1952年到1956年，平均每年增加27％强，不可说不快；但从绝对数字来说，距离新闻出版用纸的需要还远。因此，纸张生产部门应该积极地发展机制纸张的生产，挖掘潜在力量，努力试验利用各种可以利用的原料造纸，适当地增加新闻出版用纸的比重，并且不断地提高纸张的质量。同时，也应该发展手工造纸，满足社会用纸的需要，这样就可以相对地增加机制纸张对于新闻出版用纸的供应。
    为了尽可能地满足人民群众日益增长的文化要求，除了积极地增加纸的来源以外，还应该加强出版发行的计划性，从各方面来节约纸张，使有限的纸张用得适当。
    那末，应该从哪些方面来节约纸张呢？
    首先，在新闻、出版、书报发行方面应该加强计划性。今年全国新闻出版用纸的供应只有十六万五千吨。文化部门和新闻、出版单位以及书报发行单位都应当根据纸张供应的情况来安排自己的工作。这就必须调整出版计划，控制一部分书籍报刊的数量和篇幅，以保证中小学课本、扫盲课本、某些重要报刊和为人民所迫切需要的书籍的供应。今后各省、市、自治区和中央各新闻出版单位，每年都应当根据人民群众的购买能力、文化水平提高的程度、对于书籍报刊的真实需要，以及纸张供应和印刷力量的可能条件，实事求是地制定出版计划。在计划核定以后，应该按照计划进行出版发行，并且在本地区、本单位以内分别轻重缓急，调节纸张的使用。
    为了节约新闻出版用纸，保证有计划地满足人民对书籍报刊的需要，报社、杂志社应该认真按照自己的报纸、杂志的性质和读者对象，按年很好地规划合理的发行份数。报纸、杂志的宣传效果，首先决定于它们的质量，而并不像有些人设想的主要决定于数量。盲目追求出版和发行的数量，甚至发生变相摊派，增加人民的负担，这是不合于报刊的健全发展和广大人民的利益的。定期发行的报刊，不应该随便增加篇幅、缩短刊期或临时大量增加发行量。书籍出版社应该加强出书的计划性，提高出书的质量，尽量避免不必要的重复，减少那些内容空洞、言之无物的书籍，并且应该主动地掌握书籍的印数，帮助发行单位避免积压。书籍、报刊的发行单位应该很好地调查人民群众的需要，特别是农民的需要，合理地制定和掌握发行计划，减少积压、防止浪费、坚决反对摊派的办法。中央和各地区的有关领导部门在审核新闻、出版单位和书报发行单位的计划和检查他们的工作的时候，都应该把节约纸张、提高出版发行的质量作为重要尺度之一。
    全国人民，特别是消耗纸张较多的机关、团体、部队、企业、学校都应该厉行节约纸张。各个单位应该对各种内部刊物实行严格的控制，合理地调整篇幅、刊期和印数。凡是可出可不出的刊物就不出，可发可不发的对象就不发。应该尽量提高纸张的利用率，凡是可以用低级纸张的就不要用高级纸张，可以双面用的就不要单面用。工商业包装用纸也应该尽量用代用品或者废纸。各级学校应该教育学生爱护课本，尽量保持课本的整洁，留给弟妹和下一班的同学继续使用。在农村中进行宣传工作，应该尽量利用黑板报、广播筒，尽量地不用或者少用纸写的大字报。在日常工作和生活中都应该注意节约用纸，例如减少不必要的公文、表报，一个信封用两次以至三次等。只要大家重视，就会想出更多更好的办法来节约纸张。这样不仅纸张节约了，而且还可以减少文牍主义现象、提高工作效率、节省国家开支、培养爱惜物资的习惯。
