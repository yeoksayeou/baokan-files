    Three Song Titles in the "Guqin Score" Manuscript are Incorrect
    Reader Wang Mengshu wrote to point out that three song titles in the "Guqin Score" manuscript published on page 8 of this newspaper on July 1st were incorrect, namely: "Yu Shu Lin Feng" was wrongly written as "Wu Shu Lin Feng", "Gao Shan Er Qu" was wrongly written as "Sha Shan Er Qu", and "Xiao Xiang Shui Yun" was wrongly written as "Xiao Xiang Shui Yun".
    Editor: This opinion is correct. These errors were caused by the editor's lack of knowledge in this area; at the same time, the manuscript was not carefully checked before it was published.

    “古琴谱”一稿中三个曲名有错误
    读者汪孟舒来信指出，七月一日本报第八版刊登的“古琴谱”一稿中有三个曲名有错误，即：“玉树临风”错为“五树临风”，“高山二曲”错为“煞山二曲”，“潇湘水云”错为“萧湘水云”。
    编者：这一意见是正确的。这些错误的造成，是因为编者缺乏这方面的知识；同时，在稿件见报前，又没有经过认真的查对。
