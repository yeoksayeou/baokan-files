    The Workers' Life at the Tractor Factory Construction Site
    (Our report) In the autumn of 1954, there were only a few small red flags fluttering in the fields at the construction site of the First Tractor Manufacturing Plant. At that time, the construction workers lived in temporary shacks, drank yellowish river water flowing down from the mountains, and the living welfare facilities were very poor. Today, more than half of the factory buildings of the tractor factory have been built, and permanent dormitories stretch for several kilometers. The living welfare of construction workers has been greatly improved. They have their own family dormitories, employee sanatoriums, nutrition canteens, children's schools, and nurseries. Since July, the construction department and factory leaders have adopted many new measures to improve the lives of employees.
    Amateur Sanatorium
    An employee amateur sanatorium was newly established in early July. This sanatorium is located in a quiet little courtyard. Each room is arranged very neatly and comfortably. White纱 (gauze) curtains hang in the room, and new bedding and mats are spread on the soft steel wire beds, with mosquito nets on top. Flowers and plants are planted in the courtyard. Sanatorium members do not leave production, and come here to play chess, read, and chat after work. Doctors regularly examine the bodies of sanatorium members and treat chronic diseases. Yu Zhaodian, an advanced producer who was the first to implement the Soviet expert's suggestion to use the integrated hoisting method to hoist beams, columns, and roof trusses, is now recuperating here.
    Eleven such amateur sanatoriums will also be established for construction workers on the tractor factory construction site, and ten are currently being planned.
    Relief Subsidies
    Almost no one who is constructing the tractor factory is in debt or has special difficulties in life.
    Recently, the trade union organization and the enterprise administration have provided subsidies and relief to every employee with difficulties. This is the third subsidy to employees since the construction of the tractor factory. These three times, a total of more than 136,300 yuan was issued to employees for living allowances and hardship relief funds. Some time ago, worker Zhao Hailan owed more than 50 yuan because his wife was ill. Now, Zhao Hailan's debt has been completely repaid with money drawn from the employee relief fund. His wife was sent to the hospital for free treatment, and his breastfeeding son was also taken care of by a nanny hired by the trade union with relief funds.
    New Dormitories for Workers' Families
    Across from the tractor factory construction site are buildings with red tiles, white walls, and glass windows. These are the family dormitories for construction workers. From last summer to now, 1,490 such family dormitories have been added. In July of this year, the trade union organization and the enterprise administration allocated another 100,000 yuan to build a new batch of dormitories and repair a batch of old houses. The houses repaired and built this time are enough for 800 employee families to live in.
    New sunshades have recently been added to the doors and windows of existing dormitories. All employee families renting private houses are also subsidized by the trade union and the administration for 40-80% of the rent, depending on the rent level and wage income.
    Nutrition Canteen and Others
    Twelve nutrition canteens have been set up on the construction site for employees who are physically weak and suffer from chronic diseases, and more than 200 employees enjoy the treatment of public-funded nutrition subsidies. They drink milk, eat cakes, chicken eggs, and other nutritious and easily digestible foods here every day. Technician Chen Hengshan completed the work tasks of several people by himself during the intense construction process, and his health was affected to a certain extent. After two months of nutritional supplementation in the nutrition canteen, his health has recovered and his work energy is more abundant. Recently, he has continuously put forward six rationalization proposals of great value.
    Eleven new and expanded bathhouses have also been built on the construction site recently. After work every day, employees can take a free bath here. Starting in July, the haircut fee at the barber shop has been reduced from two jiao to one jiao, and employees' families can also enjoy preferential treatment. The barber shop is fully equipped, and most of the barbers are excellent skilled workers invited from Shanghai.
    There are also three film projectors on the construction site that are dedicated to showing movies to employees. Each employee can see at least one movie a week. Previously, employees had to spend five cents to watch a movie. Starting in July, watching movies is also free.

    拖拉机厂工地的职工生活
    本报讯　1954年秋天，第一拖拉机制造厂工地上只有几面小红旗在庄稼地里随风飘扬。那时候，建筑工人住的是临时搭起来的席棚，喝的是从山上流下来的黄澄澄的河水，生活福利设施很差。今天，拖拉机厂半数以上的厂房盖起来了，永久性的宿舍连绵好几公里。建筑工人的生活福利大大改善了。他们有了自己的家属宿舍、职工业余疗养所、营养食堂、子弟学校和托儿所。七月份以来，施工部门和工厂领导上又采取了不少新的措施，来改善职工生活。
    业余疗养所
    七月初，新办了一个职工业余疗养所。这个疗养所设在一所幽静的小院子里。每一个房间都布置得很整洁、很舒适。屋里挂着洁白的纱窗，软绵绵的钢丝床上铺着新被褥和凉席，架着蚊帐。院子里种着花草。疗养员们不脱离生产，收工以后来这里下棋，读书，谈天。医生们经常为疗养员检查身体，治疗慢性疾病。第一个坚持贯彻苏联专家建议，用综合装吊法吊装梁、柱、屋架的先进生产者于钊典，现在就在这里疗养。
    在拖拉机厂工地上，还将为建筑工人建立十一个这样的业余疗养所，现在有十个已在筹办。
    救济补助金
    建设拖拉机厂的职工，现在几乎已经没有一个人负债或者在生活上有特殊困难了。
    最近工会组织和企业行政方面对每一个有困难的职工都进行了补助和救济。这是拖拉机厂建厂以来对职工进行的第三次补助。这三次共发给职工生活补助费和困难救济金十三万六千三百多元。前些时候，工人赵海蓝因为妻子有病，欠下了五十多元的债。现在，赵海蓝欠的债已经全部由职工救济金中抽钱偿还了。他的妻子被送往医院免费治疗，正在吃奶的儿子，也由工会用救济费雇了一位保姆来照顾。
    工人家属的新宿舍
    拖拉机厂工地对面，有一幢幢红瓦、白墙、玻璃窗的房屋，这是建筑职工的家属宿舍。从去年夏天到现在，这样的家属宿舍增加了一千四百九十间。今年七月份，工会组织和企业行政方面又拨款十万元，兴建一批新宿舍，修补一批旧房屋。这次修补和建筑的房屋，够八百户职工家属居住。
    现有宿舍的门口和窗户上，最近都新添了凉棚。所有租住民房的职工家属，也按房租高低和工资收入的多少，由工会和行政分别补助了40—80％的房租费。
    营养食堂及其他
    工地上为身体衰弱和患有慢性疾病的职工举办了十二个营养食堂，二百多个职工享受公费补助营养的待遇。他们每天在这里喝牛奶，吃蛋糕、鸡子等营养高、好消化的饭菜。技术员陈恒山在紧张的施工过程中一个人完成了几个人的工作任务，身体健康受到一定的影响。经过在营养食堂两个月的营养滋补，他的健康已经恢复，工作精力更加充沛。近来，他连续提了六项有重大价值的合理化建议。
    工地上最近还新建和扩建了十一个澡塘。每天下工以后，职工们可以免费在这里洗澡。从七月份开始，理发馆的理发费由二角降低为一角，职工家属也可以享受优待。理发室设备齐全，理发员大部分是从上海请来的优秀的技术工人。
    工地上还有三部电影机专为职工放映电影。每个职工在一周内至少可以看到一次电影。以前，职工看电影要花五分钱，从七月份开始，看电影也免费了。
