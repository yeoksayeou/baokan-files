Xinhua News Agency, Paris, July 4th: TASS reported that the World Peace Council Standing Committee issued the "Declaration of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Council" adopted at its meeting held in Paris from June 23rd to 25th. The full text of the declaration is as follows:

    The World Peace Council believes that the new international situation not only requires new efforts but also requires significant changes in the ways of solving problems and the methods of fighting for peace.

    The World Peace Council has full confidence in making various efforts and achieving these changes.

    The people of all countries have begun to recognize the benefits of the easing of tensions in international relations, which they have hoped for and fought for, and this easing has favorably affected the relations between the governments of all countries. This situation of reconciliation has created new conditions for national life. It provides the people of all countries with greater tolerance and more freedom. It strengthens the tendencies of neutralism and independence that exist in many countries.

    However, the expansion of armaments, the testing of nuclear weapons, and the search for new decisive weapons are still continuing. All of this deprives the people of all countries of the large amounts of wealth necessary to improve their welfare, and it keeps the danger of a comprehensive armed conflict, despair, and panic still present.

    Therefore, in order to eliminate the distrust existing in the West as well as in the East, it is now more necessary than ever for the concerted action of peace-loving forces. This distrust still hinders international cooperation and the resolution of important international issues. To eliminate this distrust, the support of the American people and the Soviet people is needed.

    This cannot be accomplished without the participation of the people of countries in various blocs and countries like India and Yugoslavia, which have positively stated that they do not belong to these blocs.

    In this situation, the World Peace Council will constantly seek to make contact with all organizations working for the cause of peace. It hopes to consult with these organizations and take certain joint actions with them, based on respect for the characteristics and positions of each participant.

    The Peace Council believes that this work must be carried out completely independently of governments and political parties and solely for the benefit of the cause of peace.

    The Peace Council will implement all reforms and changes that contribute to these joint actions. It hopes that all other groups and organizations will be able to work to ensure that the various activities to defend peace receive the necessary coordination.

    In order to build trust in the relations between peace organizations, the Peace Council is prepared to participate in discussions on all issues related to international problems and to seek consensus on these issues.

    In view of the universal desire of world public opinion for disarmament, the Peace Council recommends that all peace forces launch broad movements in their own forms, which will enable the governments of many countries and the United Nations not only to issue declarations on various aspirations but finally to conclude the first few agreements expected by the people of all countries.

    世界和平理事会常委会发表宣言
    将设法同所有和平组织加强接触
    号召一切和平力量争取实现裁军
    新华社5日讯　塔斯社巴黎四日讯：世界和平理事会常务委员会发表了它在六月二十三日到二十五日在巴黎举行的会议上通过的“世界和平理事会常务委员会宣言”，宣言全文如下：
    世界和平理事会认为，新的国际局势不仅要求作新的努力，而且要求对解决问题的途径和争取和平斗争的方式作重大的改变。
    世界和平理事会有充分的信心来进行各种努力和实现这些改变。
    各国人民已经开始认识到在国际关系中的紧张局势的缓和的好处，这种缓和是他们所期望的和曾为之斗争过的，并且这种缓和已经有利地影响了各国政府之间的关系。这种和解的情况已经给国家生活创造了新的条件。它给各国人民提供了更大的容忍和更多的自由的可能性。它加强了在许多国家中存在的中立主义和独立的倾向。
    可是，扩充军备、试验核子武器和找寻新的起决定性作用的武器还在继续着。这一切剥夺了各国人民提高他们生活福利所必需的大量财富，并且使全面的武装冲突的危险、使绝望和惊慌依然存在。
    因此，为了消除存在在西方以及东方的不信任，现在爱好和平力量的一致的行动比过去任何时候都更为必要，这种不信任仍然阻碍着国际合作和重要国际问题的解决。要想消除这种不信任，需要有美国人民和苏联人民的支持。
    如果没有各个集团的国家的人民以及像印度和南斯拉夫这些肯定表示不属于这些集团的国家的参加，这件事情也就不能够完成。
    在这种情况下，世界和平理事会将经常设法同一切为和平事业而工作的组织进行接触。它希望同这些组织进行商谈，并且同它们在尊重每个参加者的特点和立场的基础上采取某些共同的行动。
    和平理事会认为，这种工作必须在完全不依赖于政府和政治党派的条件下进行，并且仅仅是为了和平事业的利益。
    和平理事会将实行一切有助于这些共同行动的改革和改变。它希望，所有其他一切团体和组织将能努力使保卫和平的种种活动得到必要的配合。
    为了在和平组织之间的关系中建立信任，和平理事会准备参加同国际问题有关的一切问题的讨论，和设法在这些问题上求得一致的意见。
    鉴于世界公众希望裁军的普遍愿望，和平理事会建议一切和平力量通过它们自己的形式展开广泛的运动，这种运动要能使许多国家的政府和使联合国不仅仅发表关于各种愿望的宣言，而且终于缔结为各国人民所期待的头几个协定。
