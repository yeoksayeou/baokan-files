Xinhua News Agency, via TASS, reports: Yugoslav President Tito and his entourage returned to Belgrade on the evening of June 27 after visiting the Soviet Union and Romania.

He spoke to over 200,000 Belgrade residents who came to welcome him in front of the station.

	Never Again a Situation Like 1948
	Tito first spoke about his visit to the Soviet Union, saying: "The ordinary people there, the workers in the cities and the peasants in the collective farms, both young and old, were so sincere towards us, and this sincerity deeply moved us. Therefore, we felt that the three weeks we spent there were so short. It is very clear that all of this shows that the Soviet people welcomed us with extremely joyful hearts, indicating the re-establishment of friendship between our two countries. During our interactions with the Soviets, we deeply felt that everything that happened in 1948 was completely incomprehensible to them and contrary to their will. This matter weighed heavily on them as much as it did on us, and they hope to forget everything immediately and treat the painful situation that existed between us for several years as a lesson for the future, so that similar situations will never happen again."

	Yugoslavia Firmly Building Socialism
	Tito said, "We are convinced that what the Soviet people and the current Soviet leaders want most is to ensure international peace and build their bright future under peaceful conditions. No one can shake this belief of ours."

	Tito said that it would be utterly foolish if there were no friendly relations and cooperation between countries building socialism. We have never concealed, and we do not want to conceal now, that we firmly stand on the side of building a more just new social system—socialism. Therefore, it is logical for us to maintain the best possible relations with countries that share the same goal.

	Tito pointed out that Yugoslavia also hopes not only to maintain the existing good relations with Western countries but also to further expand them, because this is in line with the spirit of peaceful cooperation and active coexistence with countries with another system, namely the capitalist social system.

	I think there is something in the world that is very important in a negative sense, and of course, also harmful. This is the lack of sincerity in establishing mutual trust between countries with different social systems. The Soviet side has provided enough facts to prove that it does not want war and that there is no danger of it taking any aggressive action.

	Friendly Cooperation with Socialist Countries
	The President advocated laying a solid foundation for future relations between Yugoslavia and the people's democratic countries.

	He said that we have now established fruitful economic and cultural cooperation with almost all countries that are building socialism. However, our political cooperation lags behind economic and cultural cooperation. We hope that the emptiness that still exists in our relations with some countries that are building socialism will be overcome as soon as possible, so that we can say that there is no difference in our friendly relations and cooperation with any of these countries.

	When talking about the talks on economic cooperation held in Moscow, Tito said: We received a considerable amount of loans from the Soviet Union under very favorable conditions. This is the most suitable approach for us, and we are willing to adhere to this approach in our relations with other countries.

	The President said that the news in some Western newspapers, which said that Yugoslavia was losing its independence, was an absurd fabrication. Tito went on to say that the Soviet leaders have never, not even in a single word, mentioned that we should worsen our relations with Western countries, whether in economic, political, or cultural terms. On the contrary, their views are exactly in line with ours that such cooperation should continue and develop, because it is beneficial to everyone and will strengthen peace and trust between all peoples.

	Disagrees with Humiliating Conditions for U.S. Aid
	The President went on to say that we regret that during our visit to the Soviet Union, some individuals and several American newspapers frenziedly and maliciously opposed our establishment of the best possible relations with the Soviet Union. Things have reached such a point that some people have threatened to immediately stop all aid to Yugoslavia. You know that we have always expressed our gratitude for the aid given to Yugoslavia by the U.S. government and people. But I want to emphasize that we will never agree to grant us this aid with some humiliating conditions attached, or conditions that violate our independent policy, whether in diplomacy or internal affairs.

	The President spoke about the visit of the Yugoslav government delegation to Romania. He said that the Yugoslav-Romanian declaration is not only a major step forward but also a foundation for strengthening the friendly relations and cooperation between our two countries.

	Implement the Spirit of the Belgrade Declaration
	The President concluded by saying, "I believe that this visit to the Soviet Union and Romania has great significance for the future, and it will have a particularly positive impact not only on this part of the world but also on international cooperation throughout the world. Forgetting the past and implementing the spirit of the Belgrade Declaration are very important to us and particularly beneficial to our country. This proves that we have obtained a sound basis for further developing our good relations and cooperation, and this will undoubtedly promote the consolidation of world peace."

    铁托总统回到贝尔格莱德时发表讲话
    强调社会主义各国应保持尽可能好的关系
    新华社据塔斯社讯　南斯拉夫总统铁托和随行人员，在苏联和罗马尼亚访问以后，在六月二十七日晚上回到贝尔格莱德。
    他在车站前面向二十万以上前来欢迎的贝尔格莱德居民讲话。
    永不再发生类似1948年情况
    铁托首先谈到他访问苏联的情况，他说：“城市的工人和集体农庄的农民这些普通的人，不论老少，对我们都是那样地真诚，这种真诚深深地感动了我们。因此，我们感觉在那里逗留的三个星期的时间是这样地短促。很明显，这一切都说明苏联人民是怀着极为愉快的心情来欢迎我们的，说明我们两国重新友好了。我们和苏联人交往的过程中深深体会到：1948年所发生的一切，对他们来说完全是不可理解的，同他们的意志相违背的；这件事使他们和我们一样感到非常沉重，他们希望立刻忘记这一切，并且把我们之间存在几年的那种令人痛心的状况当作今后的教训，以便永远不再发生类似情况。
    南斯拉夫坚定地建设社会主义
    铁托说，我们深信，苏联人民和现在的苏联领导人首先希望的是：保障国际和平，在和平的条件下建设自己美好的未来。任何人都不能动摇我们这个信念。
    铁托说，如果建设社会主义的各国之间不存在友好的关系和合作，那是最愚蠢不过的事。我们从来不曾掩饰，现在也根本不想掩饰，我们坚定地站在建设更为公正的新社会制度——社会主义。因而，我们同抱着同样目的的国家保持尽可能好的关系这是合乎逻辑的。
    铁托指出，南斯拉夫同时不仅希望同西方国家保持现有的良好关系，而且希望进一步扩大这种关系，因为这是符合同另一种制度即资本主义社会制度的国家和平合作和积极共处的政策的精神的。
    我认为世界上有某种东西在否定意义上来说是非常重要的，当然，也是有害的。这就是缺乏在社会制度不同的国家间建立相互信任的诚意。苏联方面已经有足够的事实证明，它不要战争，它没有采取任何侵略行动的这种危险性。
    同社会主义各国友好合作
    总统主张为南斯拉夫同各人民民主国家之间今后的关系打下巩固的基础。
    他说，我们现在差不多同正在建设社会主义的各国在经济和文化上都已经建立有富有成果的合作关系。但是，我们在政治上的合作是落后于经济和文化上的合作的。我们希望，在我们和某些正在建设社会主义的国家的关系中，到目前还存在的空虚情况将尽快地得到克服，以便可以这样说：我们同这些国家的任何一国的友好关系和合作是没有任何差别的。
    铁托在谈到在莫斯科进行的关于经济合作问题的会谈的时候说：我们得到苏联在十分优惠的条件下给予相当巨额的贷款。这是最适合我们的方式，我们愿意在我们同其他国家的关系上遵守这一方式。
    总统说某些西方报纸的消息是荒谬的捏造，这些消息说什么南斯拉夫在失去自己的独立。铁托接着说，苏联领导者一次也没有，而且一字也没有提到我们应该使我们同西方国家无论在经济、或是在政治和文化方面的关系恶化。恰恰相反，他们的观点同我们的观点正相符合，应当继续和发展这种合作，因为这对大家有利，并且会加强和平和各国人民之间的信任。
    不同意有屈辱条件的美援
    总统接着说，我们遗憾的是，在我们访问苏联期间，某些人士和若干美国报纸疯狂恶毒地反对我们同苏联建立尽可能好的关系。事情已经到如此程度：有人威胁要立即停止对南斯拉夫的一切援助。你们知道，我们一向对美国政府和人民给予南斯拉夫的援助表示感谢。但是我要强调说，我们决不同意：给我们这种援助时附加某种屈辱条件，或者是使人侵犯我们无论在外交或内政上的独立政策的条件。
    总统讲到南斯拉夫政府代表团对罗马尼亚的访问。他说，南斯拉夫和罗马尼亚两国声明不仅是向前迈进的一大步，而且是加强我们两国友好关系和合作的一个基础。
    贯彻贝尔格莱德宣言精神
    总统最后说，我认为，这次对苏联和罗马尼亚的访问对于将来具有重大的意义，它不仅对世界的这一部分，而且对整个世界的国际合作都将产生特别良好的影响。忘怀过去，贯彻贝尔格莱德宣言的精神，这对我们是非常重要的，对我们国家特别有益。这证明了我们已经获得进一步发展我们的良好关系和合作的健全基础而且这无疑将会促进世界和平的巩固。
