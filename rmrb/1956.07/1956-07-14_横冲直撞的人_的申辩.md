    Reaction to Criticisms and Suggestions from This Newspaper
    "The Defense of a 'Rushing and Bumping Person'"

    To the Editors: The "rushing and bumping person" criticized in your newspaper on July 1st is me. That day, my attitude at the gate of the Tianjin State-Owned Commercial Storage Company warehouse was indeed not calm enough, but I did not rush and bump. Because I had gone to this warehouse to handle business several times, and the first time I went, I handed over my "letter of introduction" and received an entry and exit warehouse card number "28." That day, because I was anxious to transport the remaining goods back to Beijing, I took another gate. At that time, the police officer on duty asked me about it, and I explained the situation to him, requesting that he contact the comrades handling the business and they would know. He refused, insisting that I go to their security office. I requested to load the goods first and then go to the security office, but they still refused. I requested to see the warehouse director to explain the situation, but they said, "During the current period of eliminating counter-revolutionaries, the warehouse director is a leader who cannot be seen casually; to see him, you must have the approval of the security office." Therefore, a dispute arose between us. Their security captain even ordered two security comrades to hold guns and take me away. Of course, I could not tolerate such a violation of human rights and protested against them. Later, the traffic police outside also criticized their inappropriate actions and criticized my bad attitude. That is the truth of the matter. I believe that it is wrong for them not to examine their own unreasonableness and infringement of human rights, but instead to one-sidedly exaggerate other people's shortcomings in a report that does not conform to the facts. I hope relevant parties will provide education and correction.

### “横冲直撞的人”的申辩

    对本报批评建议的反应
    “横冲直撞的人”的申辩
    编辑同志：七月一日你报批评的“横冲直撞的人”就是我。那天，我在天津市国营商业仓储公司仓库门口态度确实不够冷静，但并没有横冲直闯。因为我到这个仓库去办业务已好几次了，在第一次去的时候就交出了“介绍信”，并领到了一个出入仓库卡口的符号“28号”。那天我因要急于把剩下的一点货运回北京，就走了另一道门。当时值岗警察问我，我曾向他说明情况，要求他和他们办理业务的同志联系一下就可知道，他不答应，一定要我到他们警卫室去。我要求先把货装走再到警卫室去，他们也不答应。我要求见仓库主任说明情况，他们说：“现在肃反期间，仓库主任是首长不能随便见，要见也得警卫室批准。”因此我们双方发生了争执，他们的警卫队长竟命令两个警卫同志持着枪来要把我带走。我当然不能忍受这种侵犯人权的行为，就向他们提出了抗议。后来，外面的交通警察也批评了他们的做法不妥，对我的态度不好也提出了批评。事情的真相就是这样。我认为他们自己不讲道理、侵犯人权不作检讨，反而片面夸大别人的一些缺点进行不符合事实的报道，是错误的。希望有关方面予以教育纠正。
