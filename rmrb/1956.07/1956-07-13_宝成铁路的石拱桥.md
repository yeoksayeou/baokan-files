    Stone Arch Bridges on the Baoji-Chengdu Railway
    By Our Correspondent Fu Dong

    The sunset painted the horizon with a touch of delicate crimson. Engineer Wu Cheng-san stood by the road, gazing at the steep, continuous mountains stretching north and south and the rushing river beside the road. He recalled the words of the leading comrades about using the stones from these mountains to build stone arch bridges on the Baoji-Chengdu Railway. "That's right, the leadership's decision is correct. Using local materials and building bridges with stone can save the country a large amount of steel and cement. Moreover, it eliminates the need for frequent painting like steel beams and replacing sleepers, which can also save a considerable amount of maintenance costs." His mind conjured up images of stone bridges as grand as mountains. He seemed to see trains loaded with passengers and goods smoothly passing over these magnificent stone bridges, crossing the Daba Mountains, spanning the Jialing River, and climbing the Qinling Mountains towards the north...

    However, it was no easy task to assemble thousands of stones into a bridge without a single crack. A year ago, Wu Cheng-san had inspected the bridge and culvert projects on a railway line. Among hundreds of stone bridges, over 60% had cracks. Those bridges were not even large, with spans of only one to six meters. "Could it be true that 'nine out of ten arches crack' and there is no way to prevent it?" "No," Wu Cheng-san said to himself, "those flimsy stone bridges were built according to the standards of Anglo-American capitalist countries. This time, I must respond to the leadership's call and find a way to eliminate cracks."

    Wu Cheng-san inspected the line once and then returned to Chengdu. He pondered this problem all day long, thinking about it while eating and before going to bed, his entire body and mind consumed by this issue. One day, he returned from outside and saw cracks in the brick arch of his own doorway. He wondered, do all arches have cracks? To find out, he carefully examined all the arches on the entire street. Days passed, but he couldn't figure it out. Frustrated, he took his children to the park to play on Sunday. He left the children to play under a brick bridge, while he sat alone on the bridge, deep in thought. Suddenly, he remembered the lyrics from the opera "The Little Shepherd Boy," which he often sang as a child: "...Who built the Zhaozhou Stone Bridge?..." When he worked in Hebei earlier, he often heard people say that Hebei had four treasures: "Cangzhou Lion, Dingzhou Pagoda, Zhengding Bodhisattva, and Zhaozhou Bridge," with the Zhaozhou Bridge being the most famous. Although he had never had the opportunity to see the Zhaozhou Bridge himself, he had seen photos and read articles about it. The bridge had a span of thirty-seven meters and was built more than 1,300 years ago by a craftsman named Li Chun during the Sui Dynasty. After more than a thousand years of wind and rain, it was still in good condition and could still be used by people and vehicles. This showed that stone bridges do not necessarily have cracks.

    Soon after, by chance, Wu Cheng-san was sent to inspect the foundation depth of the Taiping Bridge in Luojiang County, Sichuan. This was a stone arch bridge, over thirteen meters long, and the locals said that the bridge had been in use for over two hundred years. Wu Cheng-san saw heavy trucks driving back and forth on the bridge and thought: why could the working people of the past build such good bridges, but people now have no solution?

    "What does Soviet literature say about stone arch bridges?" He recalled the instructions of the leading comrades who often told him: "Study the advanced experience of the Soviet Union carefully," and went to look up books. After flipping through the books, he found that Soviet experts also said that stone arch bridges were good and could last for more than a thousand years. In contrast, general steel beam bridges need to have their steel beams replaced every seventy-five years. But how to build stone arch bridges without cracks? Wu Cheng-san looked for teachers in Soviet books. He read during the day and at night, and refused to rest on Sundays. Finally, he found it. The book said that in order to avoid cracks, the arch ring should be built in sections when laying it, and the arch frame should be removed using sand, so that the bridge body is slowly and evenly stressed... That's what the book said, but would it work on the Baoji-Chengdu Railway? Wu Cheng-san thought it over and over, and combined with the actual situation, he suggested to the leadership to establish a long-span stone arch bridge demonstration group to build two large stone arch bridges first to see.

    The plan was approved shortly after it was submitted. The leadership decided to build two bridges at Qili River in Luojiang, one with a span of twenty-eight meters and the other with a span of fifteen meters. More than one hundred capable workers and technicians were also transferred to work.

    Wu Cheng-san was busy again for a while. After he told everyone how to build in sections, how to pre-add height, and how to use sand cylinders to lower the arch frame, he thought it was all right and returned to Chengdu.

    One day, he suddenly received an emergency call from the construction site: "New cracks have been found in the newly built bridge." Wu Cheng-san rushed to the scene and saw that, indeed, there was a thin crack at the arch foot of each hole. What to do? He discussed it with the workers and engineers for a long time. Although he came up with a way to grout it, he did not find a fundamental solution to the problem.

    "When encountering difficulties, look for the advanced experience of the Soviet Union." This was the knack he had learned in his work during these times to overcome difficulties. He flipped through the books again. The Soviet books clearly stated: leave an empty seam at the arch foot and put in iron bars to avoid cracks.

    The method was found, but was it suitable for use on site? According to the regulations, it had to be built in eleven sections, which was too troublesome. Moreover, each empty seam required one ton of iron bars, which was too wasteful. In addition, a tripod was also required. Could it be changed to six-section construction? He went to the engineers and workers to discuss it, and everyone thought that this method was quite good. Each hole could save fifty-six carpenters and 85% of iron bars, and a tripod was not needed.

    Now, this method has been used to build more than twenty bridge holes on the Baoji-Chengdu Railway, with the largest span being twenty-five meters, and none of them have cracks. Wu Cheng-san creatively completed the task of building stone arch bridges, saving the country more than 1.7 million yuan.

    Anyone who has been to the Baoji-Chengdu Railway and sees those magnificent stone bridges that span the turbulent rivers like mountains, with bridge holes as large as city gate openings, where seven or eight cars can run side by side, cannot help but cheer from the bottom of their hearts.

    宝成铁路的石拱桥
    本报记者　傅冬
    晚霞给天边涂上了一抹娇艳的淡红色。工程师吴成三站在路旁，眺望着陡峻的、连绵不断的向南北延展的山峦和那路边奔腾澎湃的河流，想起了领导同志说的要用山上这些石头在这条宝成铁路上修石拱桥的话。“不错，领导上的决定是正确的。就地取材，用石头筑桥，可以给国家节约大批的钢筋水泥，又不要像钢梁那样经常油漆和抽换枕木，还可以省一笔不小的养护费。”他的脑海中出现了一座座像山一样的石桥。他似乎看到了一列列的火车，载着满满的旅客和货物平稳地驶过这雄伟的大石桥，穿过大巴山，跨过嘉陵江，爬上秦岭向北方驶去……。
    可是，把成千上万块石头并成一座桥，还要没一点裂缝，确不是一件容易的事。一年前，吴成三曾检查过一条铁路线的桥涵工程。在几百座石桥中，60％以上有裂纹。那些桥还不算大，跨径只有一公尺到六公尺。“难道真像人们所说的‘十拱九裂’没法防止吗？“不，”吴成三对自己说：“那些不结实的石桥都是按照英美资本主义国家的标准修建的。这一次自己一定要响应领导号召想法消灭裂纹。”
    吴成三在线路上看了一遍，就回到成都。他整天琢磨这个问题，吃饭也想，睡觉前也想，整个身心都给这个问题迷住了。有一天他从外边回来看见自家门洞上用砖作的拱门也有裂纹，他心里想，是不是所有的拱门都有裂缝？为了要弄个清楚，他把整个一条街上的拱门统统仔细看了一遍。日子一天天过去了，问题也没弄出个头绪，他心烦得了不得，星期天就带孩子去公园里玩。他把孩子送到一个砖桥下玩，自己一个人坐在桥上沉思。突然间，他想起自己小时常爱唱的“小放牛”这出歌舞剧的戏词：“……赵州石桥什么人儿修？……”早先自己在河北工作的时候，也常听人说，河北有四宝：“沧州狮子定州塔，正定菩萨赵州桥”，其中以赵州桥最出名。这赵州桥自己虽然一直没机会去看过，但是见过照片，也见过别人写的介绍文章。这桥跨度长三十七公尺，是一千三百多年前隋朝一个叫李春的工匠造的。经过一千多年的风吹雨打，到现在还好好的，照样可以走人过车。这说明石头桥不一定都有裂纹。
    没多久，凑巧，吴成三被派去检查四川罗江县太平桥的桥基深度。这是一个石拱桥，有十三公尺多长，当地的人介绍说这桥已经用了二百多年。吴成三看到载重汽车在桥上驶来驶去，心里想：为什么从前的劳动人民能修这样好的桥，现在的人反倒没了办法呢？
    “苏联书上对石拱桥是怎么个看法？”他想起领导同志常常对自己说的：“好好学习苏联先进经验”的指示，就去查书。一翻书，不错，苏联专家也说石拱桥好，能用一千多年。而一般的钢梁桥七十五年就要换一次钢梁。然而怎么样能造没裂纹的石拱桥呢？吴成三在苏联书上找老师。他白天看，晚上看，星期天也不肯休息，到底让他找出来了。书上说，要想没裂纹，在按砌拱圈的时候要分段砌筑，拆卸拱架要使用沙土，使桥体缓缓均匀受力……书上是这样说的，具体到宝成路上行不行呢？吴成三左思右想，结合现场情况，建议领导上成立个长跨度石拱桥示范组，先修两座大石拱桥瞧瞧。
    计划提上去后，没多久就批下来了。领导上决定在罗江七里河修两座桥，一座桥孔的跨径是二十八公尺，另一座桥孔的跨径是十五公尺。还调了一百多位得力的工人和技术人员来工作。
    吴成三又忙火了一阵子。当他把怎样分段砌筑，怎样预加高度，怎么样用沙筒降落拱架的具体施工方法告诉大家后，他以为没事了，就又回到了成都。
    一天，他突然接到工地来的紧急电话：“新砌的桥又发现了裂纹。”吴成三急急忙忙赶到现场一看，可不是，每一孔的拱脚都有一条细细的裂纹。这怎么办？他同工人、工程师一块商量了好久，虽然想出了个法儿，用浆灌好，可是并没有找出解决问题的根本办法。
    “遇到困难，找苏联先进经验”这是他这些时候在工作中得出来的克服困难的窍门。他又翻书。苏联书上写得清清楚楚的：在拱脚留出一道空缝，放铁棒，就可避免裂纹。
    办法是找到了，可是用到现场上合适不合适？按规程要分十一段砌，这样实在太麻烦了，再说每一个空缝要放一公吨的铁棒也太浪费。另外还得用三角架。能不能改成六段砌筑呢？他去找工程师、工人核计，大家一琢磨觉得这法儿挺不错，每孔可以省去五十六个木工和85％的铁棒，还可以不用三角架。
    现在用这法儿已经在宝成铁路上修了二十多孔桥，跨径最大的有二十五公尺，没一座有裂纹。吴成三创造性地完成了建筑石拱桥的任务，给国家节约了一百七十多万元。
    去过宝成铁路的人，看到那一座座横跨在湍急的河流上像山一样的雄伟大石桥，桥孔大得就像个大城门洞似的，可以并行七、八辆汽车，没有一个人不从心底里喝彩。
