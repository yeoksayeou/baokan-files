    The Mold
    Zang Kejia

    After a junior high school entrance exam, I heard a sigh from a paper grader:

    After looking at many papers, one gets a feeling of "more or less the same." The beginning is always "We live in a happy era," and the ending inevitably includes "Willing to strive for the future of communism." Children's lives are lively and diverse, but their essays are dry and lifeless, as if they were in a mold. The words in their essays are heard from the teachers' mouths on weekdays and memorized from books. If they wrote about their own lives in their own words, how much rich material would we see!

    After saying this, he shook his head repeatedly.

    This gentleman's words reminded me of my own childhood. At that time, essays always started with the grand statement "Man is born into this world." Back then, we didn't feel anything wrong with writing like that, because everyone did it that way, and the teacher would even mark it with circles.

    Whether it's "Man is born into this world" or "We live in a happy era," they are all molds. The only difference is the age of the mold. How many vibrant young children are forced into these molds, turning into rigid little old men.

    The situation is even more serious than this. The year before last summer, I had the opportunity to attend a graduation party for a kindergarten. Watching the children dance and sing, full of life and innocence, was a scene of vitality. However, when the same child who was just singing freely stood up as the graduate representative to deliver a speech, the situation was completely different. He stood in front of the crowd like a small piece of wood, his face serious, completely different from before.

    "At the time of parting, I am filled with reluctance..." He spoke, but then stopped. Not that he couldn't speak, but he had forgotten the memorized script. After a long pause, he repeated the previous "words" and barely continued. When he finished the last sentence, the parents in the audience responded with warm applause. I heard someone say, "This child, it's really hard on him!"

    After hearing this child's speech, I felt a pang of heartache. Long after, when I recalled this incident, I always felt very sad.

    We must not force lively children into molds, and we must not force children to speak like adults, or even prepare a set of words for them in advance. Elementary school teachers, the burden on your shoulders is not light!

    套子　　
    臧克家
    一个初级中学招生过后，我听了一位阅卷先生的慨叹：
    看了许多卷子，令人发生“差不多”的感觉，开始总是“我们生长在幸福的时代”，结尾少不了“愿为共产主义的未来而奋斗”。孩子们的生活是活泼的，多样的，他们的文章却是干巴巴的，像是有一个套子。他们文章里的话，是从平日老师们的口里听来的，是从书本子上记下来的，如果他们用自己的话写自己的生活，那该有多么丰富的东西给我们看呵。
    说完了，他频频地摇头。
    这位先生的话，使我记起了自己的少年儿童时代，那时作文，开头离不了“夫人生于世”这顶大帽子，当时这么作也不觉得怎样不好，原因是大家都这么作，这么作了老师还给你画圈圈。
    不论是“夫人生于世”和“我们生长在幸福的时代”都是套子，所不同的，只在这套子的新旧而已。多少生机活泼的少年儿童被套入这套子，变成了死死板板的小老头。
    情况还有严重于此的。前年暑假，我有机会参加了一个幼儿园欢送毕业同学的联欢会，看孩子们跳舞唱歌，活泼天真，一片生机。可是，当刚才自由活泼唱歌的那个孩子以毕业生代表资格站出来致答词的时候，情况便完全不同了。他站在大众面前像一根小木头，脸色严肃，判若两人。
      “临别之时，不胜依恋……”，讲着讲着，讲不下去了，不是讲不下去而是把背熟的稿子忘记了。停了许久，把前边的“话”又重复了一遍，勉强地接了下去。当他讲完最后一句的时候，全场的家长们报以热烈的掌声。我听见有人说：“这孩子，真难为他呀！”
    我听了这孩子的演讲，真感到心痛，好久以后，追忆起这件事，总觉得很难过。
    我们不能把生气勃勃的孩子套进套子里去，我们不能逼着孩子说大人的话，甚至硬给他先编好一套。小学教师们，你们肩上的担子可不轻呀！
