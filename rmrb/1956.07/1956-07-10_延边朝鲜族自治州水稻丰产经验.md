The Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture in Jilin Province consists of five counties (Yanji, Antu, Helong, Wangqing, Hunchun) and one city (Yanji City), with a population of over 700,000, of which the Korean ethnic group accounts for more than 70%. It is a well-known rice-producing area in Northeast China. Korean farmers have always been accustomed to cultivating rice. After liberation, due to the implementation of land reform and the development of mutual aid and cooperation (now 95% of farmers have joined advanced cooperatives), farmers' enthusiasm for production has increased. In addition, the local Party committee and government actively led farmers to open up paddy fields, and rice cultivation has developed rapidly. In 1952, the rice area here was 31,983 hectares, accounting for 16.2% of the prefecture's total sown area; rice production accounted for 37.5% of the prefecture's total grain output. In 1956, it is planned to plant 42,130 hectares of rice.

This area is mostly mountainous and hilly, with an altitude of generally over 500 meters; the climate is relatively cold, with a frost-free period of 140 to 160 days, with the shortest being only 110 days, and the annual rainfall is generally between 400 and 600 millimeters. The Korean farmers here are best at developing paddy fields for rice cultivation, and they will always find ways to utilize even a small source of water.

In terms of rice cultivation techniques, the farmers here have a strong spirit of research. Most cooperatives have comparison demonstration fields; they actively absorb advanced experience from abroad, and after testing and improvement, apply it to large-field production. The average yield per hectare of rice in this area in 1949 was only 3,946 jin, but in 1952 it reached 6,476 jin, and in 1955 it rose again to 7,400 jin, with a highest record of 20,100 jin per hectare.

The main experiences in rice cultivation in this area are as follows:

One, select high-yielding varieties suitable for local conditions. The rice paddies in the Yanbian area are roughly divided into two types due to differences in terrain and climatic conditions. These two different types of paddy fields are planted with different varieties: In plains and hilly areas close to the plains, the soil is fertile, and the masses mostly use fertilizer-resistant, high-yielding, and relatively late-maturing varieties such as Aomori No. 5 and Yuanzi No. 2.

In cold mountainous areas, the frost-free period is about 110 days, the water temperature is low, and the temperature changes greatly. The masses here mostly use early-maturing varieties such as Improved Hokkaido, Xiaobai Rice, and Ishikari White Hair.

Two, improve seedling cultivation methods and transplant rice seedlings early. This is the main measure to increase rice production in cold regions. The seedling cultivation methods adopted by the local people include dry beds, cold beds, and water beds: 1. Dry bed seedling cultivation method: According to meteorological surveys over the years, the day and night temperatures in late April in this area differ greatly. The method of dry bed seedling cultivation is to erect windbreaks around the seedbeds and cover the seedbeds with straw curtains at night, which can generally raise the bed temperature by 2-3 degrees, and can raise it by 6-7 degrees in low-temperature conditions. The method of dry bed seedling cultivation can be sown as early as late April to extend the growing period of rice, which is convenient for adjusting the transplanting period and promoting the early maturity of relatively late-maturing varieties. 2. Cold bed seedling cultivation method: The cold bed is slightly the same as the dry bed. In the early stage of seedling, oil paper windows are used to cover and keep warm; in years with particularly low temperatures, the heat preservation effect of the cold bed is better than that of the dry bed. 3. Water bed seedling cultivation method: This seedling cultivation method is generally used for planting early-maturing varieties. In addition to setting up windbreaks and sunning water pools, attention is paid to the careful preparation of seedbeds and the use of suitable seedling fields.

According to the advanced experience of agricultural cooperatives in various parts of Yanbian, using dry bed and cold bed seedling cultivation can transplant rice seedlings 5-10 days earlier than water bed seedling cultivation. The seedlings growing in dry land in the early stage have developed root systems and are strong. After transplanting, the seedlings return to green quickly and tiller early. Selecting relatively late-maturing varieties can also be transplanted in early June, which has a great effect on promoting early maturity. The dry bed seedling cultivation method is simple and easy to implement, and only costs 4-5 more workdays per mu (equal to 1.5 city mu) than water beds, and can be widely promoted. The cost of oil paper windows for cold beds is high, and the bed temperature rises quickly. The difference between the bed temperature and the outside climate is large, and the technology is not easy to master. Only agricultural cooperatives with skilled technology can use it.

Sunning seeds, selecting seeds with salt water, soaking seeds, and germinating seeds before sowing are techniques that can be generally achieved by agricultural cooperatives.

Three, adopt advanced close planting methods to fully utilize land fertility. The transplanting methods in the Yanbian area used to be very extensive. Later, they were gradually changed to square row transplanting with row and hole spacing of 7-8 inches. Since 1952, after learning from the close planting experience of labor models in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and after continuous experimentation and improvement, the following three close planting methods are mainly adopted:

1. Single-row close planting: In addition to the original square (row and hole spacing of 6×6 inches) close planting of the masses, the row and hole spacing has been reduced to 6×5, 6×4, and 6×3 inches on the original basis. This method is generally used for large-area cultivation, which is convenient for transplanting and saves labor.

2. Small triangular close planting (or quadrangular close planting), which belongs to the cluster planting type: The row and hole spacing of small triangular close planting are both 6 inches, the hole spacing within the small triangle is 3 inches, 5-7 seedlings are planted in each hole, and 348,000 holes and 1.74 million to 2.43 million seedlings are reached per hectare. Agricultural cooperatives with abundant labor and able to master timely transplanting and fertilization are more likely to use this method of transplanting.

3. Double-row equidistant close planting (complex, double-plant): The row spacing is seven inches, the distance between the double rows is 2.6 to 3.5 inches, the holes between the two rows are planted in an N shape, the hole spacing is 3 inches to 4 inches, and 438,000 to 660,000 holes are reached per hectare, with 4-6 seedlings planted in each hole, totaling 1.75 million to 3.96 million seedlings. The double-row equidistant close planting method can still yield high when the soil fertility is very high and varieties with weak tillering ability are used.

Four, apply more base fertilizer and topdressing fertilizer early. In order to increase rice production, local agricultural cooperatives have adopted various methods to actively accumulate fertilizer in order to achieve the purpose of increasing fertilizer application.

The climate in the Yanbian area is cold, and it is particularly necessary to apply more base fertilizer. The method of applying base fertilizer is: reasonably combine and apply decomposed and semi-decomposed farmyard manure and compost in stages. When plowing for the first time in the spring, combine with plowing to apply semi-decomposed fertilizer into the soil, generally with a dosage of about 40,000 jin. The dosage in high-yield areas is even more, some reaching 64,000 jin. The applied semi-decomposed fertilizer can gradually decompose with the increase of temperature and the activity of microorganisms, thus ensuring the nutrients needed for each stage of rice growth. The period of topdressing fertilizer is generally earlier (10-15 days after transplanting), and the amount applied is also less (for land with poor growth, 150 to 200 jin of ammonium sulfate and 400 jin of kangdong soil are topdressed per hectare; for land with vigorous growth, wood ash or superphosphate lime is applied as appropriate).

Five, plow early, plow deep, and plow twice in spring. In the past, during the small-scale peasant economy in the Yanbian area, plowing and preparing the land were not very careful. In recent years, due to the development of agricultural cooperativization, the land preparation methods of various agricultural cooperatives have been greatly improved. Generally, they can plow twice in the spring, and individual ones also implement autumn plowing.

Six, adjust the water layer in a timely manner to promote early maturity. In the past, most paddy fields generally used deep irrigation, which not only wastes water, but also makes the rice stems thin and weak and easy to lodge. In recent years, agricultural cooperatives have been able to adjust the water layer in a timely manner according to the growth stage of rice.

In cold water areas in the mountains, it is very important to increase the water temperature of irrigated paddy fields. In Wangqing, Antu and other areas, afforestation and forest protection have been implemented in recent years, and the thawing of ditch water has been delayed. The irrigation water temperature is very low, which affects the growth and development of rice. The masses of Luotuo Mountain in Wangqing County have set up water sunning ponds in the fields in order to solve this problem. According to experiments, the water temperature in the sunning pond is 4-5 degrees higher than the water temperature without sunning.

Seven, use paddy field weeding machines to cultivate and weed in a timely manner. In the early stage of tillering, agricultural cooperatives use paddy field weeding machines to carry out the first cultivation and weeding, and then carry out the second cultivation and weeding ten days later. One to two days after weeding, the soil is loosened and weeds are removed near the rice roots by hand, generally three times. The third time is mainly to remove barnyard grass, which is carried out before heading. The use of paddy field weeding machines for cultivation not only has high work efficiency, but also can completely eliminate weeds.

Eight, prevent and control diseases and insect pests. Seedling blight of rice is relatively common in the local area. Agricultural cooperatives use 50 times formaldehyde solution to disinfect seeds to prevent this disease.

The Party and government leading organs and the vast number of farmers in the Yanbian area attach great importance to absorbing and promoting advanced experience. In 1952, the emphasis was on summarizing and promoting Cui Zhusong's "careful land preparation, cultivation of strong seedlings, rational close planting, increased application of manure, and shallow water irrigation" yield-increasing measures in Yanji; in 1953, peasant representatives such as Cui Zhusong were organized to study rice yield-increasing experience in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.

    延边朝鲜族自治州水稻丰产经验
    延边水稻丰产经验考察组
    吉林延边朝鲜族自治州共辖五县（延吉、安图、和龙、汪清、珲春）一市（延吉市），人口70余万，朝鲜族占70％以上，是我国东北地区有名的稻米产区之一。朝鲜族农民一向习惯栽培水稻。解放以后，由于实行了土地改革，发展了互助合作（现已有95％的农户参加了高级社），农民的生产积极性提高了，再加当地党委、政府积极领导农民开辟水田，水稻的栽培迅速发展。1952年这里的水稻面积是31，983公顷，占全州总播种面积的16.2％；水稻产量占全州粮食总产量的37.5％。1956年计划种植水稻42，130公顷。
    这个地区大部是山地丘陵，海拔一般在500公尺以上；气候较冷，无霜期140天至160天，最少的仅110天，年降雨量一般在400至600公厘之间。这里的朝鲜族农民最善于发展水田种植水稻，只要有一点水源，总会想办法利用。
    在栽培水稻的技术方面，这里的农民很有钻研精神。大部分合作社都有对比示范田；积极吸取外来的先进经验，经过试验改进，应用到大田生产中来。这个地区的水稻1949年每公顷的平均产量只3，946斤，1952年便达到了6，476斤，1955年又上升为7，400斤，最高记录每公顷20，100斤。
    这个地区栽培水稻的经验，主要有以下几点：
    一、选用适合当地条件的丰产品种。延边地区的稻田，因地势和气候条件的差异，大致分为两种类型。这两种不同类型的稻田，种植的品种也不同：平原地带及接近平原丘陵区，土质肥沃，群众多采用青森五号、元子二号等耐肥、丰产、较为晚熟的品种。
    山区寒冷地带，无霜期约110天，水温低，气温变化大。这里的群众多采用改良北海道、小白稻、石狩白毛等早熟种。
    二、改进育苗方法，提早插秧。这是寒冷地区水稻增产的主要措施。当地群众所采用的育苗方法有陆床、冷床和水床三种：1，陆床育苗法：根据历年气象调查，当地四月下旬昼夜温度相差很大。陆床育苗的方法，是在苗床周围架设防风障，夜间在苗床上加盖草帘，一般可提高床温2—3度，在低温情况下可提高6—7度。采用陆床育苗法，可以提早在四月下旬播种，以延长水稻的生长期，便于调节插秧时期，促使较为晚熟的品种提早成熟。2，冷床育苗法：冷床和陆床略同，在苗前期，用油纸窗复盖保温；在气温特殊低的年份，冷床的保温效果比陆床好些。3，水床育苗法：种植一般早熟品种的，普遍采用这种育苗方法。除了设防风障、晒水池外，并重视苗床的精细整地和采用合式秧田。
    根据延边各地农业合作社的先进经验，用陆床、冷床育苗，比水床育苗能提早插秧5—10天。初期在旱地生长的秧苗，根系发达，秧苗粗壮，插秧后返青快，发稞早，选用较为晚熟的品种，也能在六月上旬插秧，对促进早熟有很大作用。陆床育苗法简单易行，每亩（等于1.5市亩）比水床只多花4—5个工，可以普遍推广。冷床的油纸窗的成本高，同时床温升高很快，床温和床外气候相差大，技术不易掌握，只有技术熟练的农业社才能采用。
    播种前的晒种、盐水选种、浸种、催芽等技术，一般农业合作社都能普遍做到。
    三、采用先进密植方法，充分利用地力。延边地区过去的插秧方法很粗放，后来逐步改为行、穴距7—8寸的正行插秧。自1952年学习朝鲜民主主义人民共和国劳动模范的密植经验后，经过不断的试验和改进，目前主要采取以下三种密植方式：
    1、单行密植：除群众原有的正方形（行、穴距6×6寸）密植外，已在原有的基础上缩小行、穴距为6×5、6×4、6×3寸。一般大面积裁培时候，采用这种方式，插秧方便，节省劳力。
    2、小三角形密植（或四角形密植），属于簇植法的类型：小三角形密植的行、穴距都是6寸，小三角内的穴距为3寸，每穴插秧5—7株，每垧达到34.8万穴，174万至243万株。凡劳力充裕，能掌握适期插秧和施肥量较多的农业合作社，多采用这种方法插秧。
    3、双行等距离密植（复式、双株）：行距七寸，双行之间的距离为2.6到3.5寸，两行间各穴插成N字形，穴距3寸到4寸，每公顷达到438，000到660，000穴，每穴插秧4—6株，共175万到396万株。双行等距密植法，在土壤肥力很高的时候，用分蘖力不强的品种，产量还是高的。
    四、多施基肥，早期追肥。当地各农业合作社为了增产稻谷，都采取了各种办法，积极积肥，以达到增施肥料的目的。
    延边地区气候寒冷，特别需要多施基肥。施基肥的方法是：将腐熟和半腐熟的厩肥和堆肥合理配合，分次施用。在春翻第一遍时，结合犁田，把半腐熟的肥料施入土中，一般用量为四万斤左右。丰产地的用量更多，有的达到64，000斤。施下去的半腐熟肥料，随着气温上升和微生物的活动，可以逐渐分解，因而保证了水稻生长各阶段所需要的养分。追肥施用的时期一般较早（在插秧后10—15天），施用的数量也较少（生长较差的地，每公顷追施硫铵150至200斤，炕洞土400斤；生长茂盛的地，酌施草木灰或过磷酸石灰）。
    五、早耕、深耕、春翻二遍。延边地区的稻田，在过去小农经济时候，翻地整地很不细致。近年来由于农业合作化的发展，各农业合作社的整地方法有了很大的改进，一般能做到春翻二遍，个别的还实行秋翻地。
    六、适时调节水层，促进早熟。以往一般稻田，采用深灌的较多，不但浪费水，而且会使水稻茎秆细弱，容易倒伏。最近几年，各农业合作社多能按照水稻生育阶段，适时的调节水层。
    山间冷水地区，提高灌溉稻田的水温是很重要的。汪清、安图一带，近年来实行封山育林，沟水化冻延迟，灌溉水温很低，影响水稻生长发育。汪清县骆驼山的群众为了解决这个问题，设立本田晒水池。据试验，晒水池中的水温，比没有晒的水温提高4—5度。
    七、运用水田中耕除草器，适期中耕除草。在分蘖初期，各农业合作社采用水田中耕除草器进行第一次中耕除草，十天后再进行第二次中耕除草。除草后一至两天，再用手在稻根附近松土除草，一般进行三次。第三次主要是拔除稗草，在孕穗前进行。运用水田除草器中耕，不仅工作效率高，并且能彻底消灭杂草。
    八、防治病虫害。当地水稻的恶苗病比较普遍，各农业合作社采用50倍的福尔马林液进行种子消毒，防治这种病害。
    延边地区的党政领导机关和广大农民很重视吸取和推广先进经验。1952年着重总结推广了延吉崔竹松的“细致整地、培育壮苗、合理密植、增施粪肥、浅水灌溉”的增产措施；1953年又组织农民代表崔竹松等，去朝鲜民主主义人民共和国学习水稻增产经验。
