Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, 28th. Xinhua News Agency reporter Zheng Ting reports: The construction and section-by-section opening of the Yingtan-Xiamen Railway has begun to bring about significant changes in the economic landscape of the northern Fujian mountain region.

	Along both sides of the railway, a new land and water transportation network is gradually taking shape. The thousands of kilometers of highways, waterways, and cart tracks connecting Shaowu City and the surrounding nine counties have largely been completed ahead of schedule in terms of expansion and renovation projects, connecting many remote mountain villages that were previously almost isolated from the outside world to the cities. Tens of thousands of tons of timber and grain, which could not be transported out in the past due to mountain barriers, are now being steadily transported to Shaowu Station and then shipped to other places. Nowadays, inexpensive industrial products and fertilizers can be bought even in remote mountain villages. Many lumberjacks and old hunters are tasting Changbai Mountain wine and the famous Jinhua ham for the first time. Some mountain villages can now see the People's Daily just two or three days after its publication.

	In order to meet the needs of developing the mountain economy, factories, timber yards, and numerous small hydropower stations, warehouses, hospitals, schools, shops, etc. are being planned and built near some towns along the railway line. Near Nanping City, the transportation hub for land and water in the northern Fujian mountain area, a mechanized paper mill with an annual output of 33,000 tons of newsprint and a timber yard capable of holding 300,000 cubic meters of timber, equipped with a complete set of automatic loading machinery, will soon begin construction. The streets of many towns along the line have been repaired and widened, and the number of hotels and restaurants is also increasing.

	In the barren mountains, which were previously inhabited by wild cats and wild boars, many newly built and expanded state-owned comprehensive farms have emerged. On the land reclaimed with agricultural machinery such as tractors, a large number of subtropical melons and fruits have been planted; herds of fine-breed dairy cows have also been greatly increasing in number. In the future, fresh milk and fresh fruits will be supplied to passengers along the line.

### 鹰厦铁路逐段通车　闽北山区面貌一新

   ·鹰厦铁路逐段通车　闽北山区面貌一新·
    新华社福州28日电　新华社记者郑汀报道：鹰厦铁路的修建和逐段通车，使福建北部山区经济面貌开始发生重大的变化。
    沿着铁路两侧，新的水陆交通运输网正在逐渐形成。邵武城和附近九个县相联结的成千公里的公路、航道、大车道，扩建和整治工程已大都提前完工，在从前几乎与世隔绝的许多边远山村，现在和城市联结起来了。数以万吨计的过去因为关山阻隔不能外运的木材和粮食，正源源流送到邵武站，再转运到外地。如今，在边远的山村里，也能买到廉价的工业品和肥田粉了。不少伐木者和老猎户第一次尝到长白山的葡萄酒和著名的金华火腿。一些山村已可看到两、三天前的人民日报。
    为了适应开发山区经济的需要，在铁路沿线的一些城镇附近，正在筹划和兴建工厂、贮木场和众多的小型水力发电站、仓库、医院、学校、商店等。在闽北山区水陆交通总枢纽的南平城附近，不日即将动工兴建一座年产三万三千吨新闻纸的机械化造纸厂，和一座拥有全套自动装车机械设备，可容纳三十万立方公尺木材的贮木场。沿线许多城镇的街道都修补和加宽了，旅社、饭店等也在增加。
    在不久前还是野猫、野猪等栖息的荒山中，出现了许多新建和扩建的国营综合农场，在用拖拉机等农业机械垦复的土地上，栽种了大批亚热带瓜果；成群的良种奶牛也大量地繁殖起来。今后沿线将有鲜牛奶和鲜瓜果供应过往旅客。
