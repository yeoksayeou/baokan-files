Xinhua News Agency Report:  Local road networks are being formed in the areas along the Chengdu to Guangyuan section of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway's southern segment, which is now open to traffic. According to incomplete statistics, since January of last year, twenty-one simple roads have been built on both sides of this 319-kilometer-long railway line. These roads support the railway in distributing materials and are responsible for short-distance transportation between regions, counties, and townships.

The construction of the simple road from Zitong county seat to Renhe in the same county has facilitated the export of live pigs from the county. Before this road was built, people had to slaughter the pigs, salt them for preservation, and then hire people to carry them to the railway station. Now, these live pigs are transported by trucks to the Sichuan-Shaanxi highway and then transferred by train. This not only saves a large amount of rural labor but also reduces transportation costs.

The Chengdu-Guangyuan section is the area with the most abundant products and the densest population along the entire Baoji-Chengdu Railway line. This year, Mianyang Prefecture, Sichuan Province, through which the railway passes, plans to build a total of 260 kilometers of simple roads and 630 kilometers of rural roads to help distribute materials.

    把地方交通网同铁路连接起来
    宝成路南段建成二十一条简易公路
    据新华社讯　宝成铁路南段通车的成都到广元一段的沿线地区，连接铁路的地方公路交通网正在形成。据不完全统计，自去年一月到现在，在这段长三百一十九公里的铁路两旁，已经建成二十一条简易公路，配合铁路集散物资，担负地区之间和县乡之间的短途运输。
    由梓潼县城到这个县的仁和的简易公路的修筑，便利了这个县的生猪外运。这条公路没有建成以前，人们只好把猪先杀死用盐腌好，再雇人背运到火车站。现在，这些生猪由汽车接运到川陕公路再转由火车运输，不仅节省农村大批劳动力，而且降低了运输费用。
    成都至广元段，是宝成铁路全线物产最丰富、人烟最稠密的地区。铁路经过四川省绵阳专区，今年共要修建二百六十公里长的简易公路，修六百三十公里长的乡村大路，帮助集散物资。
