    Critically Accept Cultural Heritage
    Peking Opera "Luoma Lake" and "A Bowl of Snow" Staged

    (Our newspaper reports) The Peking Operas "Luoma Lake" and "A Bowl of Snow," which have not been performed for a long time, met with the audience in the capital again on the evening of the 12th. In the current situation of generally sluggish attendance at theaters, the tickets for this performance were sold out within half an hour.

    The person in charge of the Beijing Municipal Opera and Drama Editorial Committee told reporters that although many Peking Opera programs have some problems in terms of content, they have many merits in terms of singing, dancing, and so on. These are all valuable cultural heritages of the motherland. Especially since the actors who can perform these plays are very old, if we do not quickly accept their performing arts, there will be a danger of them being lost in the future. In order to critically accept and inherit the cultural heritage of the motherland, explore and sort out traditional Peking Opera plays, and enrich the repertoire of Peking Opera, the Beijing Municipal Opera and Drama Editorial Committee plans to gradually select some traditional Peking Opera plays that have not been performed for a long time in the future, and invite some representative actors to perform them publicly, and widely solicit opinions from the masses on the content of the scripts and the performance aspects. The opinions of the masses and the opinions of experts will be provided to the actors for reference, so as to carry out processing and sorting. The evening of the 12th was the first public excavation and sorting performance held by the Editorial Committee. (Dian)

    批判地接受文化遗产
    上演京剧“落马湖”“一捧雪”
    本报讯　久未上演的京剧“落马湖”“一捧雪”，十二日晚重又同首都观众见面。在目前一般戏院上座不景气的情况下，这次演出的戏票半小时内就卖光了。
    北京市戏曲编导委员会的负责人对记者说，许多京剧节目虽然内容上多少有些问题，但是在唱腔、舞蹈等方面却有很多可取之处，这些都是祖国宝贵的文化遗产。特别是目前能演出这些剧目的演员年岁都很大，如果不赶快把他们的表演艺术接受过来，将来就有失传的危险。北京市戏曲编导委员会为了批判地接受和继承祖国文化遗产，发掘和整理京剧传统剧目，以及丰富京剧的上演节目，今后准备陆续选择一些久未上演的京剧传统剧目，并请一些具有代表性的演员公开演出，广泛征求群众对剧本的内容和表演方面的意见。把群众的意见和专家们的意见一起供给演员参考，以便进行加工整理。十二日晚就是编导委员会第一次公开举行的发掘整理演出。　（甸）
