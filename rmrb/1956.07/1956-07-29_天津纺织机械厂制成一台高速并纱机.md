Tianjin Daily News: China's first self-made high-speed doubling machine has been successfully trial-produced at the state-owned Tianjin Textile Machinery Factory. After inspection and trial spinning, it has been preliminarily proven that the machine has good performance.

This high-speed doubling machine has a precise structure and a high rotation speed. Its efficiency is one to two times higher than that of ordinary doubling machines. It can combine five strands of fine yarn together (ordinary doubling machines can only combine two to three strands of yarn). After twisting by a twisting machine, it can weave cord fabric for various tires for automobiles, airplanes, etc. It can also combine two strands of fine yarn together, and after twisting by a twisting machine, it can weave fine fabrics such as gabardine and poplin.

This machine will be transported to a cotton textile factory in Shanghai at the end of this month for production appraisal. If the appraisal is qualified, it will be mass-produced in the second half of the year.

    天津纺织机械厂制成一台高速并纱机
    据天津日报讯　我国自制的第一台高速并纱机已经在国营天津纺织机械厂试制成功。经过检查和试纺，初步证明这部机器性能良好。
    这部高速并纱机构造精密，转速很高，比一般的并纱机效率高一至二倍，可以把五根细纱并在一起（一般并纱机只能并二至三根纱），经过拈线机加拈以后，能够织出汽车、飞机等各种轮胎的帘子布，也可以把两根细纱并在一起，经过拈线机加拈以后，织出华达呢、府绸等细质布。
    这部机器将在本月底运到上海棉纺织厂进行生产鉴定，鉴定合格后，将在下半年大量生产。
