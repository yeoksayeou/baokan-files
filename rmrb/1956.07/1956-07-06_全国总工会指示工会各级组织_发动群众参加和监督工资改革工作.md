Xinhua News Agency, July 5th: The All-China Federation of Trade Unions recently issued an instruction to trade union organizations at all levels regarding wage reform work.

The instruction, after explaining the principles and significance of the State Council's decision on wage reform, stated: Wage reform is an important task at present, and it is a major matter concerning the development of production and the immediate interests of every worker. Therefore, trade union organizations at all levels must attach great importance to this work, mobilize and educate the masses, and supervise the administration in correctly implementing the State Council's various regulations on wage reform. At the same time, in this wage reform, it is required to conduct extensive and in-depth education on wage policies among the workers and masses, enhance the socialist consciousness of the workers and masses, and further encourage the workers and masses to build socialism with enthusiasm.

The instruction stated: Trade union organizations at all levels must, under the unified leadership of the Party committees, conscientiously do the following tasks:

First, conduct extensive and in-depth propaganda and education work among the workers and masses. With reference to the wage reform propaganda outline compiled by the Wage Department of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, and in conjunction with the actual situation of the industry, region, and enterprise, conduct extensive propaganda and education on wage policies among the workers and masses. Focus on publicizing the significance and principles of wage reform, so that the workers and masses understand the relationship between increased production and increased wages, and understand what is meant by remuneration according to labor.

Second, mobilize the workers and masses to actively participate in wage reform work, support the various measures of wage reform, and supervise the administration in correctly implementing the State Council's "Decision on Wage Reform." Trade union grassroots organizations should organize the masses to seriously discuss the wage reform plan and study the new technical grade standards.

In the process of wage reform, trade union grassroots organizations must effectively establish a system of mass supervision. For all the correct measures taken by the administration regarding wage reform, the trade union should organize the masses to give full support and ensure their implementation. For the shortcomings and errors in the wage work, the trade union should listen to the opinions of the masses, support the criticism of the masses, and help and urge the administration to quickly correct them. For violations of the State Council's regulations on wage reform, such as arbitrarily lowering or raising wage standards, failing to assess grades according to technical grade standards, and failing to pay back wages according to regulations, trade union organizations must adhere to principles and ensure the implementation of the Party and state's policies and laws.

Third, in wage reform work, the organizational role of the trade union must be fully utilized. The trade union grassroots committee must carry out wage reform work under the unified leadership of the Party committee, and give full play to the role of the various working committees, especially the wage working committee, to prevent a few full-time cadres from working alone. In wage reform work, trade union grassroots organizations should set up reception rooms (stations), with members of the wage committee taking turns on duty in their spare time to receive the masses, listen to their opinions and requests, and answer their questions.

Fourth, trade union organizations at all levels should recognize that this wage reform is only a reasonable reform of the wage grade system for workers and the wage system for staff members. To thoroughly realize the principle of remuneration according to labor and to maximize the material incentives of wages, it is still necessary to widely implement the piece-rate wage system and establish a bonus wage system.

In addition, trade union organizations must strengthen the inspection and supervision of the implementation of wage policies, regularly study the dynamics of wages, periodically check the use of wage funds, and promptly propose suggestions for improvement upon discovering problems. Furthermore, it is necessary to strengthen the supervision of the supply of daily necessities and actively help the administration solve the welfare problems related to the lives of workers to ensure the increase in the actual income and the improvement of the lives of workers.

This wage reform will increase wages significantly, and the state's financial expenditure will increase. Therefore, trade union organizations must mobilize and educate workers to work harder to increase production to ensure the completion of this year's plans to increase labor productivity, reduce costs, and hand over profits.

    全国总工会指示工会各级组织
    发动群众参加和监督工资改革工作
    新华社5日讯　中华全国总工会最近对工会各级组织发了一个关于工资改革工作的指示。
    这个指示在阐释国务院关于工资改革决定的原则和意义之后说：工资改革是当前的一项重要任务，是关系生产发展和每个职工切身利益的一件大事情。因此，工会各级组织必须十分重视这件工作，发动和教育群众，监督行政正确地执行国务院有关工资改革的各项规定。同时，在这次工资改革中，要求对职工群众广泛深入地进行工资政策的教育，提高职工群众的社会主义觉悟，进一步鼓舞职工群众建设社会主义的积极性。
    指示说：工会各级组织要在党委统一领导下切实地做好以下几项工作：
    第一，对职工群众进行广泛深入的宣传教育工作。参照全国总工会工资部编写的工资改革宣传提纲，结合本产业、本地区和本企业的实际情况，向职工群众广泛进行工资政策的宣传教育。着重宣传工资改革的意义和原则，使职工群众懂得生产提高和工资增加的关系，懂得什么叫做按劳取酬。
    第二，发动职工群众积极参加工资改革工作，支持工资改革的各项措施，监督行政正确地执行国务院“关于工资改革的决定”。工会基层组织要组织群众认真讨论工资改革方案，学习新的技术等级标准。
    工会基层组织在工资改革的过程中，要切实地把群众监督制度建立起来。对于行政关于工资改革的一切正确措施，工会要组织群众给予充分的支持，并保证实现。对于工资工作中的缺点和错误，工会要听取群众的意见，支持群众的批评，并且帮助和督促行政迅速改正。对于违背国务院有关工资改革的规定，例如，任意压低或提高工资标准，不按照技术等级标准评定等级，不按照规定补发工资等等，工会组织必须坚持原则，保证党和国家的政策法令的贯彻执行。
    第三，在工资改革工作中，必须充分发挥工会的组织作用。工会基层委员会必须在党委统一领导下进行工资改革工作，并发挥各工作委员会特别是工资工作委员会的作用，防止少数脱产干部单干。在工资改革工作中，工会基层组织应该设立接待室（站），由工资委员会委员在业余时间轮流值班，接待群众，听取群众的意见和要求，解答群众的疑问。
    第四，工会各级组织应该认识到这次工资改革只是合理地改革工人的工资等级制度和职员的工资制度，要彻底实现按劳取酬的原则和最大限度地发挥工资的物质鼓励作用，还有赖于广泛实行计件工资制度和建立奖励工资制度。
    此外，工会组织必须加强对工资政策执行情况的检查和监督，经常研究工资的动态，定期检查工资基金的使用情况，发现问题，及时提出改进的意见。并且，要加强对生活必需品供应的监督，积极地帮助行政解决有关职工的生活福利问题，以保证职工实际收入的增加和生活的改善。
    这次工资改革增加工资较多，国家财政支出加大，因此，工会组织要发动和教育职工更加努力提高生产，以保证今年提高劳动生产率计划、降低成本计划和上缴利润计划的完成。
