Xinhua News Agency, Beijing. According to a report by the Polish News Agency: Soviet Council of Ministers Chairman Bulganin stated at the celebration of the 12th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of Poland in Warsaw on July 21st that we should cautiously safeguard the unity and fraternal friendship of countries and peoples in the socialist camp. Free people, including the Polish people, know that all their great achievements are due to the socialist family, and they will protect this family like the apple of their eye. They must strengthen it and make it move towards the happiness and well-being of the working people of the world!

Bulganin said that the achievements of the Polish people in the past twelve years have proved the correctness of the path they have chosen.

After recounting Poland's great achievements in economic construction, Bulganin said that the achievements of the Polish state in defending national independence and socialist construction were achieved under the leadership of the battle-tested leader of the Polish working people – the Polish United Workers' Party.

Bulganin said: Concrete political and economic difficulties accompany socialist construction. However, these difficulties are temporary, difficulties that arise during development, and they can be overcome more easily with the fraternal assistance of socialist countries. Nevertheless, the enemies of socialism, who hope to reverse the course of history and restore capitalism in the people's democratic countries, are trying to exploit these fleeting difficulties.

After seizing on the errors and shortcomings related to the cult of Stalin, imperialist ideologists are trying to slander the great doctrine of Marxism-Leninism and sow discord among the fraternal family of free countries.

The enemy knows that socialist countries are strong because of their unity, their solidarity, and their selfless friendly assistance to each other. That is why they are so eager to disintegrate, or at least weaken, the increasingly powerful socialist camp that has been formed. They hope to divide us so that they can deal with each socialist country one by one. However, despite the cunning methods used by the enemy, their provocative plans will burst like soap bubbles.

The struggle against the consequences of the personality cult and the actions taken to eliminate the shortcomings that have been revealed in the socialist camp countries have produced positive results. This can be seen in the example of Poland, where the working masses, under the leadership of their United Workers' Party, have resolutely exposed the shortcomings that have arisen in the process of socialist construction and have taken steps aimed at eliminating these shortcomings and overcoming the existing difficulties.

At the same time, it would be a mistake to ignore the fact that in the movement against the personality cult, not only have hostile and opportunist elements revived, but also wavering elements in our ranks have emerged. Deceived by hostile propaganda, these people sometimes interpret certain theories related to the personality cult inappropriately. This situation is reflected in some newspapers in several socialist countries, including Poland.

We Marxist-Leninists have always believed, and still believe, that every country has its own new contribution to the historically significant practice of socialist construction, and that in order to carry out this construction, it is necessary to develop socialist democracy in a multifaceted way. But we do not want to ignore the attempts to weaken the internationalist solidarity in the socialist camp under the guise of so-called "specific national characteristics," or the attempts to undermine the strength of the people's democratic countries under the guise of so-called "expanding democracy." No matter what subjective good intentions those who make these attempts have, their actions are against the interests of their countries and endanger the great cause of socialism and democracy.

One of the most important tasks of the Communist and Workers' Parties is to wage a principled and resolute struggle to purify Marxist-Leninist doctrine, to overcome opportunist wavering, and to consolidate their ranks ideologically and organizationally. Based on the experience of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the Party's newspaper is a powerful and effective weapon in the hands of the Communist and Workers' Parties. If the newspaper stands on a correct and Marxist standpoint, it will undoubtedly prove capable of fulfilling the glorious task of being a collective propagandist of the Party's propositions, and a collective organizer of the masses in the struggle to implement these propositions.

He said: The Soviet Union, China, Poland, Czechoslovakia, and all socialist countries have in the past and now advocate peaceful coexistence and international cooperation among countries with different social systems based on the Leninist principles. This policy has produced positive results and has led to a certain degree of easing of international tensions. Our common task is to continue to implement the policy of consolidating peace and further easing international tensions flexibly and persistently in the future.

Bulganin pointed out that the imperialists are disturbed by the achievements we have made in the struggle for peace and international security. The recent events provoked by the enemy in Poznan once again prove the fact that international reaction has not abandoned its conspiracy to restore capitalism in socialist countries. We must never forget this at any time. In this environment, any complacency is unforgivable. We must never forget that as long as there are hostile bourgeois elements and spies in the people's democratic countries, they will rise up against the people's democratic system at any opportune moment, and they will take advantage of various shortcomings, mainly the bureaucratic deviations in the work of state organs, as well as insensitivity to the complaints and needs of the working people. In this environment, maintaining a high degree of political vigilance, waging a tenacious struggle against shortcomings, constantly improving the work of state organs, forging the closest ties with workers and all working people, and consolidating the various organs of the dictatorship of the proletariat have become the sacred responsibility of the Communist and Workers' Parties, the people's government, and all working people.

    布尔加宁在波兰国庆庆祝大会上说
    保卫社会主义国家的团结
    据新华社北京电　据波兰通讯社消息：苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁，七月二十一日在华沙举行的波兰人民共和国成立十二周年庆祝大会上说，我们应该谨慎地保卫社会主义阵营国家和人民的团结和兄弟般的友谊。包括波兰人民在内的自由人民知道，所有他们的伟大成就都得归功于社会主义国家大家庭，而且他们将像保护他们的眼珠一样来保护这个大家庭。他们一定要加强它，并且使它朝着全世界劳动人民的快乐和幸福的方向前进！
    布尔加宁说，波兰人民过去十二年里面取得的成就证明了他们所选择的道路的正确性。
    布尔加宁在讲述了波兰在经济建设方面的巨大成就后说，波兰国家在保卫民族独立和社会主义建设方面的成就是在波兰劳动人民的经过战斗考验的领袖——波兰统一工人党的领导下取得的。
    布尔加宁说：伴随社会主义建设而来的是具体的政治和经济困难。但是，这种困难是暂时的、是发展中的困难，由于社会主义国家的兄弟般的援助，这种困难能够更加容易得到克服。尽管这样，希望扭转历史进程和在人民民主国家恢复资本主义的社会主义的敌人正企图利用这种转瞬即逝的困难。
    在抓住了与崇拜斯大林有关的错误和缺点以后，帝国主义思想家们正在设法诬蔑马克思列宁主义的伟大学说，在自由国家的兄弟大家庭中散布不和的种子。
    敌人知道，社会主义国家是由于他们的统一、他们的团结一致以及他们彼此间进行的无私的友谊援助而强大的。这就是为什么他们非常高兴瓦解或者至少削弱力量越来越增长的已经形成的社会主义阵营。他们希望使我们分裂，以便逐个对付每一个社会主义国家。但是，尽管敌人使用狡猾方法，他们的挑拨计划将像肥皂泡一样破灭。
    在社会主义阵营国家对个人崇拜的后果进行的斗争和消除已经揭露的缺点的行动，已经产生了积极的结果。这可以在波兰的例子中看出来，在波兰，劳动群众在他们的统一工人党的领导下，果敢地揭露了在社会主义建设过程中所产生的缺点，并且采取目的在于消除这些缺点，克服现有的困难的步骤。
    同时，忽视这样一个事实也是一个错误，这就是，在反对个人崇拜的运动方面，不仅敌对和机会主义分子复活了，同时我们队伍中的摇摆不定的人也显露出来了。由于为敌对的宣传所欺骗，这些人有时候把某些同个人崇拜有关的理论作了不适当的解释。这种情况表现在若干社会主义国家，包括波兰在内的某些报纸中。
    我们马克思列宁主义者过去认为，现在还认为每一个国家对于具有历史意义的社会主义建设的有历史性的实践，都有其某些新的，它自己的贡献，而且为了进行这种建设，必须要用一种多方面的方式来发展社会主义民主制度。但是我们不希望无视在所谓“具体的民族特点”的幌子下所进行的企图削弱社会主义阵营中的国际主义团结的尝试，在所谓“扩大民主”的幌子下所进行企图破坏人民民主国家的力量的尝试。不论作出这种尝试的人是出乎甚么主观上的善意，他们采取的行动是违反他们国家的利益，危害伟大的社会主义和民主事业的。
    共产党和工人党的最重要的任务之一在于为纯洁马克思列宁主义学说、为克服机会主义动摇、为从思想上和组织上巩固他们的队伍进行原则性的和坚决的斗争。根据苏联共产党的经验，党的报纸是共产党和工人党手中的强大的和有效的武器。如果报纸站在正确的和马克思主义的立场上，无疑地它将证明能够胜任党的主张的集体宣传者、组织群众进行争取实行这些主张的斗争的集体组织者的光荣任务。
    他说：苏联、中国、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克以及所有社会主义国家过去和现在都赞成根据列宁主义的不同社会制度的各国和平共处的原则实现和平和国际合作。这种政策已经产生积极的结果，使国际紧张局势有了一定程度的缓和。我们的共同任务是在将来仍然灵活地、坚持不懈地执行巩固和平和进一步缓和国际紧张局势的政策。
    布尔加宁指出，帝国主义者因为我们在争取和平和国际安全的斗争中所获得的成就而感到不安。敌人最近在波兹南挑起的事件又一次证明了这个事实：国际反动派还没有放弃它的想使资本主义在社会主义国家里复辟的阴谋。我们随时随刻都决不能忘记这一点。在这种环境下，任何自满都是不可饶恕的。我们决不可忘记，只要人民民主国家里存在有敌对的资产阶级分子和特务，一有适当的机会，他们就会起来反对人民民主制度，他们就会利用各种缺点，主要是利用国家机构工作中的官僚主义的偏差，以及对劳动人民的抱怨和需要的迟钝感。在这种环境中，保持高度的政治警惕，对缺点进行顽强斗争，不断改进国家机构的工作，同工人和一切劳动人民结成最密切的联系，巩固无产阶级专政的各种机构便成了共产党和工人党、人民政权和一切劳动人民的神圣责任。
