    Jubilant Automobile Factory
    The Crystallization of the Entire Factory's Labor
    The first automobile, assembled with self-made parts, emitted a crisp sound, stirring the heartstrings of all the factory workers. This living entity, composed of approximately two thousand six hundred different parts of varying sizes, is the crystallization of the entire factory's labor. It will carry four tons of construction materials to the developing Qaidam Basin or the rich Tibet.
    A group of veteran workers, with their young apprentices, surrounded this newly assembled automobile, wiping the sweat from their faces and touching the shiny parts. They smiled, the kind of smile only soldiers have after winning a battle. How much labor and wisdom they had put into manufacturing each part! More than half a year ago, they tried to make a decelerator shell, trying for more than thirty days and wasting more than twenty blanks. Later, Soviet experts proposed more than twenty methods before they succeeded. Today, they stood excitedly by the automobile, their faces glowing with happiness, because they were now able to independently manufacture automobile parts.
    Gratitude and Hope
    As the first batch of automobiles was being assembled, behind the beautiful automobile factory, a locomotive billowing white smoke, was pulling a long train, rushing over. It was delivering steel and collaborative products to the automobile factory. The ability to assemble automobiles today is thanks to the support of hundreds of factories across the country. Workers at the newly built Dalian Plastics Factory, do you know that the steering wheel you spent so long trying to make has already been installed on the automobile? Workers on the Yangtze and Huangpu Rivers, you must also be concerned about the spark plugs and the shatter-resistant tempered glass you made, right? They are also already on the automobiles. In Anshan, along the Jialing River, and in Beijing, the sounds of labor supporting the automobile factory are resounding. More than four hundred types of collaborative products, hundreds of new types of steel, and various materials are flowing into the automobile city. People across the country supporting the automobile factory, it is thanks to your wisdom and labor that the first batch of automobiles in the motherland has been successfully trial-assembled today. However, to formally mass-produce automobiles, we still need you to make persistent efforts and manufacture more new products.
    Let the Automobiles Run Smoothly
    A few days ago, the entire factory was still worried: Could the shock absorbers independently manufactured in China be installed on the first batch of automobiles being trial-assembled? Now there is no need to worry, the shock absorber department of the chassis workshop has delivered the shock absorbers on time and installed them on the automobiles. With it, the trial-assembled automobiles can run smoothly on some of the rugged roads of the motherland, without bouncing so much that it makes people's hearts flutter. The original design of the Chinese Liberation brand automobile did not include the technological design of shock absorbers. In order to adapt to the road conditions in China, the automobile factory only this year opened a new shock absorber department in the chassis workshop to independently manufacture shock absorbers. Technologist Ren Quan is responsible for the specific leadership of this work. A few years ago, he was still a driver. Through arduous study, he transformed from a student with only junior high school education into a technical personnel with a college education. He once helped workers solve very complex technical problems with automobile parts. Now, in the work of trial-producing shock absorbers, he creatively overcame many technological difficulties and, on July 11, manufactured the shock absorber with more than thirty parts. All the factory's process personnel said: We can independently create the technological design of shock absorbers, and in the future, we will definitely be able to independently design the technological regulations for all of China's own automobile parts.
    People Walking in the Forefront
    During these days of trial-assembling automobiles, the auxiliary workshop has always been at the forefront. This workshop has supplied the entire factory with more than twenty thousand types of precise and complex tools. Without them, automobiles cannot be manufactured. Grinder Wang Zuoshan deeply understands that tool production must be at the forefront of the entire factory's production. On May Day, he made a guarantee to the Party that he would complete the production tasks for the first quarter of next year ahead of schedule in May this year. Now he has already fulfilled this guarantee, rapidly stepped into the fourth quarter of next year, and started working on the workload for August 1957. Watching the trial-assembled automobiles start running, he said: "We must run faster and quickly prepare all the tools for mass-producing automobiles." (Zhang Yun)

    欢腾的汽车厂
    全厂劳动的结晶
    用自制的零件试装出的第一辆汽车，发出清脆的声响，激动了全厂职工的心弦。这个由约二千六百种不同的大小零件组成的一个活的整体，是全厂劳动的结晶。它将要载着四吨重的建筑材料，开往正在建设的柴达木盆地或富饶的西藏。
    一群老师傅，带着他们的年轻徒弟，围着这辆刚试装好的汽车，抹抹脸上的汗珠，摸摸那些漆亮的零件，他们笑了，只有战士打完胜仗以后才这样地笑。他们为了制造每一个零件，曾经付出了多少劳动和智慧啊！半年多以前，他们试制一个减速器的外壳，试了三十多天，废了二十多毛胚；后来苏联专家提出二十多种办法，才试制好。今天，他们激动地站在汽车旁，脸上露出幸福的光芒，因为他们已经能够独立制造汽车零件了。
    感谢和希望
    在第一批汽车试装出来的时候，在美丽的汽车厂后面，冒着滚滚白烟的火车头，气呼呼地牵引着漫长的列车，奔驰过来。它是给汽车厂送来钢材和协作产品的。今天能够试装出汽车，要感谢全国成百个工厂的支援。新建成的大连塑胶厂的职工们，你们可知道，你们试制很久才成功的方向盘，已经装在汽车上。在长江和黄浦江边的工人们，你们一定也很关心你们试制的火花塞，不易破碎的钢化玻璃吧？它们也已经安在汽车上了。在鞍山，在嘉陵江畔，在北京，正在喧腾着支援汽车厂的劳动声响。四百多种协作产品，成百种新品种的钢材和各种各样的材料，流进了汽车城。全国支援汽车厂的人们，因为你们的智慧和劳动今天才顺利地试装出祖国第一批的汽车。但是，要正式大量生产汽车，还需要你们再接再厉，制造更多的新产品。
    让汽车平稳奔驶
    前几天，全厂还在耽心：中国独立制造的减震器，能不能装在试装的第一批汽车上。现在不用耽心了，底盘车间减震器工部已按时交出了减震器，并装上了汽车。试装的汽车有了它，走在祖国某些崎岖的道路上，就可以平平稳稳，不会一颠一颠地震得人心里发慌。原来设计的中国解放牌汽车，没有减震器这个产品的工艺设计。汽车厂为了适应中国道路的情况，今年才在底盘车间新辟了一个减震器工部，来独立制造减震器。工艺师任荃负责具体领导这个工作。几年前，他还是个司机，经过艰苦的学习，从一个只有初中文化程度的学生，变成了一个具有大学文化程度的技术人员。他曾经帮助工人，解决了很复杂的汽车零件的技术问题。现在他又在试制减震器的工作中，创造性地打破了许多工艺上的困难，于七月十一日，把有着三十多个零件的减震器制成。全厂工艺人员都说：我们能独立做出减震器的工艺设计，将来也一定能独立设计出中国自己的全部汽车零件的工艺规程。
    走在最前面的人
    在试装汽车的这些日子里，辅助工场总是走在最前面。这个工场已经向全厂供应了两万多种精密的复杂工具。没有它们，就不能制造汽车。磨工王作山深深懂得工具生产要走在全厂生产的最前头，在五一那天向党提出保证，要在今年五月份提前完成明年第一季度生产任务。如今他早已实现了这个保证，飞快地跨进了明年第四季度，开始干1957年8月份的工作量。他看着试装的汽车在开动，他说：“我们还要快跑，把大量生产汽车的工具都快快准备好。”　（张　云）
