    Aroca's "Skylark" Flies to Beijing
    —Listening to the Performance of the Hungarian Folk Band
    Ye Lin
    A friend who had just returned from a visit to Hungary told me that Hungarian folk music is very developed. Whether in towns or villages, almost all public entertainment venues and restaurants have small professional folk bands, and you can hear enthusiastic Hungarian folk melodies everywhere. Whether they are Hungarian or from abroad, people are often warmed by these fiery melodies.
    After listening to the performance of the Hungarian folk band led by Hungarian "People's Artist" Aroca Sandor, a vivid picture of Hungarian folk music life emerged in my mind. What passionate and profound music this is! From this fiery, rugged, and heartfelt torrent of sound, we deeply felt the pride of the Hungarian nation, the beauty of the Hungarian mountains and rivers, and the enthusiasm of the Hungarian people.
    Among the folk band's repertoire, I particularly liked the Czardas dance music, the Károly dance music, and the music from the Sakter region. These folk music styles with unique characteristics revealed the essence of Hungarian folk music. The Károly dance music has a special mode and a unique style of melodic progression, which sounds particularly familiar to Chinese people. We are all familiar with and fond of the Hungarian music master Kodály's "Kora Duets." The Károly dance music he collected for this performance also has a similar style, which makes us further realize the close connection between the music master's creation and folk music. The enthusiasm of the Czardas dance music and the unrestrained nature of the Sakter music are equally loved by us. These pieces fully demonstrate the richness of Hungarian folk music in terms of modes, rhythms, and melodies. From these charming pieces of music, I increasingly strongly feel how much the Hungarian people love life; it contains the voices of the people's joy and embodies a noble feeling of patriotism.
    The cimbalom solo by Ho Su János is also one of the most brilliant programs. Not long ago, we had just heard the cimbalom solo by Nicolae Stănescu, the cimbalom player of the Romanian "Skylark" Folk Dance Music Group. These two performances with different styles each have their merits. János's performance has a stronger folk art atmosphere. His mallet use is very interesting. A folk song played with fingers instead of mallets is also very popular with the audience. He fully developed the cimbalom's playing techniques in several pieces with different playing methods. Seeing his demeanor during the performance, one feels that he is not playing the cimbalom but singing himself.
    Most unforgettable is the performance style and artistic attainment of "People's Artist" Aroca. The success of all the wonderful programs is inseparable from his leadership. His performance has the speed of the wind and strong emotions. In his adapted violin piece "Skylark," he appears even more elusive. "Skylark" was originally a "Nai" (pan flute) piece. After being introduced to Hungary from Romania in 1952, it was adapted by Aroca. Now "Skylark" has become a must-play program for the band's concerts. In Hungary, if the audience does not hear this piece at their concerts occasionally, they will ask: "Where has Aroca's 'Skylark' flown to?" Today, Aroca's "Skylark" has flown to China, and the Chinese audience, like the Hungarian audience, also loves this light and lively piece of music.
    The singing of the band's two folk singers is as touching as the band's performance. Several Hungarian folk songs and Gypsy songs reflect the life of the Hungarian people from various angles. I especially like the slow-tempo lyrical songs by bass singer László Dumaydi and the Gypsy songs by female singer Éva Kurcsi. Although we are not very familiar with these songs, we can still appreciate their deep feelings and life atmosphere. Éva's performance of the Chinese folk song "Lan Hua Hua" is particularly moving. Her performance, plus the cimbalom accompaniment and violin interlude, fully developed the emotion of this song.
    The Hungarian folk band's visit and performance gave us a lot of inspiration. During the concert, as I listened, I thought: How wonderful it would be if we could also establish such professional folk bands as widely as Hungary! We need such light music and highly developed folk music. Of course, in the folk, we also have very common professional music organizations, such as the northern Quyi storytelling, southern Cantonese opera, and Pingtan. They are also as widespread in our country as the Hungarian folk bands in Hungary, covering towns and villages. Let our folk bands also develop more vigorously in the traditional way, like the Hungarian folk bands.

    亚若卡的“云雀”飞到了北京
    ——听匈牙利民间乐队的演出
    叶林
    一位刚从匈牙利访问归来的朋友告诉我：匈牙利的民间音乐十分发达，无论是在城镇或是乡村，几乎所有的公共娱乐场所和饭馆餐厅都设有民间的小型职业乐队，到处都可以听到热情洋溢的匈牙利民间旋律。不管是匈牙利人或是来自国外的人，经常都会被这些烈火一般的音乐弄得心里热烘烘的。
    听了匈牙利“人民艺术大师”亚若卡·山道尔所领导的匈牙利民间乐队的演出以后，一幅鲜明的匈牙利民间音乐生活的图景又涌现在我的眼前。这是多么热情而又多么深沉的音乐啊！从这些烈火一般粗犷和发自内心最深处的音响的激流中，我们深切地体会到了匈牙利民族的自豪心、匈牙利山川的美丽和匈牙利人民的热情。
    在民间乐队的演奏节目中，我最喜爱的是查尔达索克舞曲、卡珞依舞曲和沙克特地方的乐曲了，这几种具有特殊风格的民间音乐把匈牙利民间音乐的特点表露无遗。卡珞依舞曲有一种特殊的调式和旋律进行的独特风格，中国人听起来感到特别亲切。我们都熟悉和喜爱匈牙利音乐大师柯达伊的“考拉双人舞曲”，这一次演出的他搜集的卡珞依舞曲也有着近似的风格，这使我们进一步认识到这位音乐大师的创作和民间音乐的紧密连系。查尔达索克舞曲的热情和沙克特乐曲的奔放同样都使我们喜爱，这些乐曲充分地表现了匈牙利民间音乐在调式、节奏和曲调上的丰富性。从这些迷人的音乐中，我越来越强烈地感觉到匈牙利人民是怎样地热爱着生活；这里面有着人民的欢乐的声音，也体现出一种爱国主义的高尚感情。
    何苏·雅诺什的大洋琴独奏也是最精采的节目之一。不久以前，我们刚听到罗马尼亚“云雀”民间舞蹈音乐团洋琴家尼古拉·斯坦涅斯库的洋琴独奏，这两次不同风格的演奏各有其优异的地方，雅诺什的演奏带有更为强烈的民间艺术的气息，他的琴槌使用得十分有风趣，有一首不用琴槌而只用指弹的民间乐曲也很受听众的欢迎。他把大洋琴的演奏技巧在几首不同奏法的乐曲中发挥得极为充分，看到了他演奏时的风貌，教人觉得他不像是在演奏洋琴而是自己在歌唱。
    最令人不能忘怀的是“人民艺术大师”亚若卡的演奏风度和艺术造诣。所有的精采节目的成功都是和他的领导分不开的。他的演奏有着风一般快的速度和强烈的感情。在他改编的小提琴曲“云雀”的演奏中更是显得神出鬼没。“云雀”原是“奈伊”（即排箫）演奏曲，在1952年由罗马尼亚介绍到匈牙利以后由亚若卡改编而成的，现在“云雀”已经成为这个乐队的音乐会的必演节目。在匈牙利，如果听众在他们的音乐会上偶尔听不到这首乐曲，便会发问：“亚若卡的‘云雀’飞到哪里去了？”今天，亚若卡的“云雀”已经飞到中国来了，中国的听众和匈牙利的听众一样，也十分喜爱这首轻巧活泼的乐曲。
    这个乐队的两位民歌歌唱家的演唱，也和乐队的演奏一样的打动人心，几首匈牙利民歌和吉普赛人的歌曲从各个角度上反映了匈牙利人民的生活面貌。我特别喜爱男低音歌唱家拉兹罗·杜马依第的几首慢速度的抒情歌曲和女歌唱家埃娃·库尔西的吉普赛人歌曲，尽管我们对这些歌曲都不是很熟悉，但也可以体会出它们的深厚感情和生活气息。埃娃演唱的中国民歌“蓝花花”令人特别感动，她的演唱加上了洋琴的伴奏和小提琴的间奏，使这首歌曲的感情得到了充分的发挥。
    匈牙利民间乐队的访问演出给了我们很多启发。在音乐会中，我一边听一边想到：要是我们也能够像匈牙利一样普遍建立起这种职业的民间乐队那该是多么好！我们正需要这样的轻音乐和高度发展的民间音乐。当然，在民间，我们也有很普遍的职业的音乐组织，像北方的曲艺说唱、南方的粤曲、评弹，它们在我国也正和匈牙利民间乐队在匈牙利一样，布遍了城镇乡村。让我们的民间乐队也像匈牙利的民间乐队一样，在传统的方式上更蓬勃地发展起来吧。
