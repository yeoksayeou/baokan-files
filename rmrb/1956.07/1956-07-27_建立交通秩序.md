    Establishing Traffic Order
    The traffic order in Tongliao City, Zhelimu League, is very chaotic. Citizens and staff of government offices do not understand traffic rules. During holidays, the number of people, horses, and vehicles on the road increases, and there are no personnel to maintain traffic order. Accidents involving bicycles and other vehicles hitting people occur frequently. Even more serious is that children often stop vehicles on the road for fun. Once, I and several comrades were in a car going to the station. In the city center, groups of children used stones to stop the car, breaking a window. In order to avoid traffic accidents, I suggest that the relevant departments of Tongliao City take active measures to maintain traffic order. Yi Bing

    建立交通秩序
    哲里木盟通辽市交通秩序很乱，市民和机关工作人员不懂交通规则，一到节日假日马路上人马车辆增多，又没有一个维持交通秩序的人员。自行车及其他车辆撞人事故不断发生，更严重的是儿童在马路上常常拦击车辆取乐。我有一次和几个同志坐车去车站，在市中心成群儿童用石子拦击汽车，打碎一块玻璃。为了避免发生交通事故，建议通辽市有关部门积极采取措施，维护交通秩序。　一兵
