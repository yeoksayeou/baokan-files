    Risking Danger to Save an Elderly Person
    On the morning of June 27th, as a train was passing the Jiankang Road crossing in Nanjing, an elderly, white-haired woman of seventy-three was slowly walking on the tracks. Residents beside the road shouted, "The train is coming!" The locomotive also kept sounding its horn, but the old woman, being deaf, did not hear. The driver braked urgently, but it was too late. At this moment, Zhang Guanghong, a cart worker who was eating nearby, saw that the old woman was about to be run over by the train. He immediately rushed onto the tracks, grabbed the old woman's clothes, and prepared to drag her out, but his hand slipped, and both of them fell. At this time, the train was only four or five inches away from them. In his urgency, Zhang Guanghong had a flash of inspiration, did a somersault, and forcefully pulled the old woman off the tracks. At this moment, the train's pilot had already touched his leg. Afterwards, Zhang Guanghong realized that he had minor injuries on his hands and legs. (Zhang Jinjian)

    冒险救老人
    六月二十七日早晨，一辆火车驶过南京建康路口时，一个七十三岁的白发老太太，正慢慢地在线路上走着，当时路旁的居民高喊：“车来了！”机车也不断鸣笛，老太太因耳聋没有听见，司机紧急刹车，可是已来不及了。这时候，正在附近吃饭的马车工人张广洪一见老太太将被车压倒，马上冲上铁轨抓住老太太的衣服，准备将她拖出，但手一滑，两人都跌倒了。这时火车离开他们只有四、五寸远。张广洪急中生智，翻了一个筋斗，用力将老太太拉出铁轨，这时火车的排障器已碰到他的腿了。事后，张广洪才发觉自己的手上和腿上都有微伤。（张金鉴）
