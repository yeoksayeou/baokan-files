The Current State of the Japanese Economy
Kimura Kihachiro, Japanese Economist and Member of the House of Councillors

(I)

Terms like "economic normalization" and "economic development without inflation" are currently popular in Japan. These buzzwords refer to: increased exports, developed production, expanded economic activity without price changes; large enterprises have repaid most of their huge loans to banks, and commercial banks have almost completely repaid their loans to the national bank—the Bank of Japan—which once amounted to 420 billion yen.

At first glance, the recent economic indicators of Japan do seem to prove these buzzwords, showing new changes in the post-war Japanese economy. In 1955, exports increased by nearly $400 million more than originally estimated, reaching $2.05 billion, and current exports are maintaining the same level. The manufacturing production index published by the Japanese Economic Planning Agency, with 1934-1936 as 100, averaged 173.8 in 1954, 189.4 in 1955, and further increased to 196.1 in February of this year, about twice the pre-war level. Moreover, the recent utilization rate of production equipment in large enterprises is said to average 85% across the entire industrial sector (according to a survey by the Japan Federation of Economic Organizations). Since the end of last year, investment in new equipment has begun to increase. The ratio of own capital to other people's investment in the enterprise capital structure of the entire industrial sector has also improved considerably, changing from 16 to 84 in 1949 to 40 to 60 in 1955.

In the financial sector, although sometimes tight and sometimes loose, it is no longer the constant "tight money" situation like after the war, but a "loose money" phenomenon has appeared, and lowering interest rates has become the central issue in the financial community.

These facts illustrate that Japan's monopoly capital has gradually re-established itself and restored its original strength in the ten years since the war. This is clearly due to the role of increased exports and good harvests since last year, which brought about market prosperity; at the same time, the "tight money policy" and "tight fiscal policy" implemented since the autumn of 1953 also played a significant role; the "special procurement boom" since the Korean War, and the so-called "Dodge Line" in 1949 before that, all played a role in this.

In other words, since 1949, large enterprises, large banks—big capitalists—have consistently shouted slogans such as "enterprise rationalization," "cost reduction," "development of exports," and "economic self-reliance," pursuing the reconstruction of the power of monopoly capital. The Japanese government's fiscal and economic policies during this period have also been focused on the same goal, and they have largely achieved their objectives.

(II)

However, it goes without saying that this is the surface of the Japanese economy, only one side, and what is the situation on the other side, that is, inside the Japanese economy?

According to statistics released by the Japanese Ministry of Labor, from January to November last year, the average monthly number of completely unemployed people was about 700,000, an increase of 25% compared to the previous year; this March even set a new record, increasing to 1.06 million. The number of "temporary workers" who are actually unemployed is also rapidly increasing. And now, due to insufficient budget, "employment security offices" restrict the registration of "temporary workers," and it is by no means easy for the unemployed to find temporary work. A report by the Economic Planning Agency states: "In the next ten years, Japan's population reaching working age will increase sharply, and its scale and speed are unprecedented even in European and American countries." Unemployment—the employment problem—has become a huge pressure on the Japanese economy.

At the same time, according to materials from the "Economic Statistics Monthly" of the Statistics Bureau of the Bank of Japan, the number of dishonored checks reached 152,000 nationwide in October last year, setting a post-war record. In March of this year, it slightly decreased to 141,500, but it still increased by 5,800 compared to 135,700 in the same period of the previous year. It is worth noting that the face value of recent dishonored checks is smaller, which shows that most of the dishonored checks are related to small and medium-sized enterprises. Although the "money supply is loose," the number of bankruptcies of small and medium-sized enterprises is increasing. The increase in the number of applications for business closures reported to the Small and Medium Enterprise Agency alone is shown in the following table:

Table of Numbers of Applications for Business Closures by Small and Medium-sized Enterprises

                  1952　　　　8,474 cases
                  1953　　　　8,155 cases
                  1954　　　　9,508 cases
                  1955 (First half) 4,953 cases

These situations reflect that the gap between the rich and the poor has further widened. According to data from the Statistics Bureau of the Prime Minister's Office of Japan, compared with the same period of the previous year, from March to May 1955, the proportion of low-income groups with an average income of less than 20,000 yen increased from 36.1% to 36.8%, the proportion of middle-income groups with an income of 20,000 to 48,000 yen decreased from 57.6% to 56%, and the proportion of high-income groups with an income of more than 48,000 yen increased from 6.4% to 7.3%.

For the Japanese people, the current state of the Japanese economy does not mean "economic stability" or "economic normalization" at all. These facts only prove that the reason why Japanese monopoly capital can largely recover is that its foundation is built on strengthening the plunder and exploitation of the working class and the broad masses of the people.

At the same time, we must also note that the recovery of Japanese monopoly capital to its current state is inseparable from the support of the United States.

Although Japan's exports increased by nearly $400 million in 1955, more than 45% of this was the increase in exports to the United States. This shows that whether the current export level can be maintained largely depends on future changes in the U.S. market situation.

Japan's international balance of payments surplus reached as high as $535 million in 1955, but if special procurement orders of $570 million are removed, the international balance of payments would instead show a deficit of $35 million. The Japanese government has already formulated a so-called economic five-year plan, setting out the prospect of maintaining the balance of international payments without special procurement orders by 1960. However, on the other hand, it hopes that special procurement orders will continue as long as possible, and has continuously made requests to the United States for increased special procurement orders.

Replacing enterprise equipment and adopting new technologies is another important aspect of Japanese monopoly capital strengthening its power, and the support of the United States has also played a major role in this regard. Large enterprises in almost the entire industrial sector of Japan have all accepted foreign technology, of which 70% is the technology accepted from the United States. However, the technology fees paid by Japanese enterprises to foreign countries for this purpose amounted to as high as $44.77 million from April 1950 to September 1955, and corporate activities are also subject to various restrictions. There are also loans to foreign countries, which amounted to approximately $110 million by the end of September last year (of which the United States accounted for 60%, plus the World Bank loans, the United States actually accounted for 96%). Foreign capital accounts for more than half of the stock investment in the oil industry sector, also reaching an amount of $30 million, of which the United States accounts for 71%.

The above-mentioned economic integration between Japan and the United States has become the foundation for the Japanese ruling class to succumb to the United States and for the U.S.-Japan military and political alliance.

(III)

Japan's industrial productivity has reached twice the level of 1934-1936, and it is still replacing and expanding industrial equipment. Under such circumstances, the problem of sales markets for goods and import markets for raw materials is becoming increasingly serious.

The Japanese government and economic circles have never been interested in expanding the domestic market by raising the living standards of the people. The statistics on the national consumption level published by the Japanese government have exceeded the pre-war level, but they do not include the huge population of small and medium-sized enterprise workers, unemployed people, and those in need of relief to maintain their livelihoods, which numbers 12 million people. Data from the Economic Planning Agency show that the rate of increase in the proportion of personal consumption in total national expenditure has gradually slowed down in recent years. However, the Japanese government and economic circles are single-mindedly committed to developing so-called emerging industries such as petroleum, coal, chemicals, and titanium, and place great expectations on consolidating and expanding the production of military weapons.

The Defense Production Committee of the Japan Federation of Economic Organizations recently made an estimate, preparing to increase the production value of aircraft and weapons (excluding ammunition and repair contracts) from approximately 12.1 billion yen in 1954 by tenfold in the next few years, expanding it to 120 billion yen, an amount equivalent to the current scale of automobile industry production.

However, as everyone knows, the Japanese economy, which relies on foreign supply for most of its important industrial raw materials, needs to increase exports more than anything else, and it is urgent. However, to steadily increase exports, it is necessary to strengthen the international competitiveness of goods, and strengthening the international competitiveness of goods requires a reliable and cheap supply of raw materials. This problem has become the biggest concern for Japanese monopoly capital colluding with the United States. Therefore, since the end of 1950, the impulse of Japanese economic circles to trade with China has never stopped and has been developing. The increase in trade between Britain, West Germany, and China has further promoted this demand.

The United States has instigated the Japanese government and economic circles to abandon the Chinese market and develop into the Southeast Asian market as compensation. This consideration and plan are still quite widespread and powerful within the current Japanese government and economic circles. Developing into the Southeast Asian market has become one of their most important policies.

However, the basic fact of abandoning the Chinese market has brought a fatal weakness to the implementation of this most important policy. Most of Japan's exports to the Southeast Asian market are consumer goods and light machinery. However, due to the development of national industries in the Southeast Asian region and the new development of China's trade with Southeast Asia, Japan's exports of this type of goods are facing a crisis. The countries in this region, with a few exceptions, are actively developing their own resources and establishing heavy industries, and therefore do need heavy machinery. However, Japan is quite behind European and American countries in this regard. According to 1953 statistics, Japan's exports of machinery to Southeast Asia were only relatively high to Thailand, but even this only accounted for 14% of Thailand's total machinery imports, while in other places it was far inferior to Britain, the United States, and West Germany. As for exports of steel, although white iron sheets accounted for 73% of all imports in Southeast Asia last year, steel pipes and structural steel were far behind European and American countries.

The root cause of this weakness in Japan's heavy industry is not any other reason, but lies in the unstable and unfavorable raw material market in Japan, which is because the Japanese economy has been unnaturally severed from its connection with the Chinese market. In order to overcome this contradiction, Japanese monopoly capital cruelly suppresses workers' wages and forces the people of the whole country to bear heavy taxes. Such a policy will naturally intensify the struggle of the Japanese working class and the broad masses of the people, and thus the rule of Japanese monopoly capital will become increasingly shaken.

The Japanese people, led by the working class, are launching an unyielding struggle against the ruling class's policy of succumbing to the United States, and demanding the restoration of diplomatic relations in order to strive for the full development of Japan-China and Japan-Soviet trade. Most Japanese people believe that in order to establish a peaceful Japanese economy and for the prosperity of the Japanese national economy, close economic ties between Japan and China are absolutely necessary.

### 日本经济的现状

    日本经济的现状
    日本经济学者、国会参议员　木村禧八郎
    （一）
    “经济正常化”、“通货不膨胀下的经济发展”等等的词儿，目前正在日本流行。这些流行语的含义所指的是：输出增加、生产发展、经济活动扩大而物价却没有变动，大企业偿还了银行巨额贷款的大部分，商业银行向国家银行——日本银行的借款一度曾高达4，200亿日元，现在也几乎全还清了。
    日本经济的最近各项指标，粗看起来，确是这些流行语的证明，显示出战后日本经济发生了新的变化。1955年的输出比原来估计增加近四亿美元，达二十亿五千万美元，目前的输出仍维持着同样的水平。日本经济企划厅公布的制造工业生产指数，以1934—1936年为100，1954年平均为173.8，1955年平均为189.4，今年二月又增为196.1，约达战前水平的两倍。而且，大企业生产设备最近的运用率，据说整个产业部门平均达到85％（日本经济团体联合会的调查）。去年年底起，新设备的投资开始增加。整个产业部门的企业资本内容，自己的资本和他人的投资的比率也有了相当的改善，从1949年的十六对八十四，变成为1955年的四十对六十。
    在金融方面，虽然时紧时松，但不再是战后那样经常的“银根紧”，而出现了“银根松”的现象，降低利息已成为金融界的中心课题。
    这些事实，说明了日本的垄断资本在战后十年的过程中，渐渐地重新建立起来，恢复了它原来的力量。这明显地是由于去年以来的输出增加、农作物丰收带来的市面景气所起的作用；同时，1953年秋天以后所实施的“抽紧银根政策”、“紧缩财政政策”也起了大作用；朝鲜战争以来的“特需景气”，以及在那之前的1949年的所谓“道奇计划”，都对此起了作用。
    换句话说，大企业、大银行——大资本家，从1949年以来，一贯高喊着“企业合理化”、“降低成本”、“发展输出”、“经济自立”的口号，追求重建垄断资本的势力，日本政府这期间的财政经济政策也是放在同一个目标上，它们大体上是达到目的了。
    （二）
    但是，不说也明白，这是日本经济的表面，只是半面，而其余的半面，就是说日本经济的里面，是怎样的情况呢？
    根据日本劳动省发表的统计，去年1月起到11月止，完全失业者的人数，平均每月约达七十万人，比前年增加了25％；今年三月更创造了新纪录，增加到106万人。实际上已经属于失业者的“临时工”也急速增加。而现在，“职业安定所”由于预算不足，限制“临时工”的登记，失业者要找到临时工作，也已经决不是件容易事了。经济企划厅的报告说：“今后十年间，日本的到达生产年龄的人口将急遽增加，其规模和速度甚至欧美各国也是从来没有过的”。失业——雇用问题，成为对日本经济的巨大压力。
    同时，根据日本银行统计局“经济统计月报”的材料，不能兑现的空头支票的数字，去年十月日本全国达十五万二千张，创战后最高的纪录。今年三月稍稍减低为十四万一千五百张，但比前年同一时期的十三万五千七百张还是增加了五千八百张。值得注意的是最近空头支票的票面数额小了，这说明空头支票大部分是和中小企业有关的。虽然“银根松”，但是中小企业的倒闭数字却在增加。仅仅向中小企业厅申报了的，其增加的情况有如下表：
    中小企业申请歇业数字表
                  1952年　　　　8，474件
                  1953年　　　　8，155件
                  1954年　　　　9，508件
                  1955年（上半期）4，953件
    这些情况反映出贫富之间的悬殊更加增大了。据日本总理府统计局的资料，1955年3月到5月日本人民的平均收入和前年同一时期相较，二万日元以下的低额收入的阶层，从36.1％增加为36.8％，二万日元到四万八千日元的中等收入的阶层，从57.6％减为56％，四万八千日元以上的高额收入的阶层，从6.4％增加为7.3％。
    日本经济的现状，对于日本人民来说，根本谈不到什么“经济安定”，什么“经济正常化”。这些事实只是证明了日本垄断资本之所以大体上能恢复，它的基础是建筑在加强对工人阶级及广大人民的掠夺和榨取之上的。
    与此同时，我们还必须注意到，日本垄断资本恢复到今天这样的情况，是和美国的支持分不开的。
    1955年日本输出虽增加近四亿美元，可是其中45％以上是对美国输出的增加。这就说明，是否能维持现在这样的输出水平，很大程度需要依赖美国市场情况今后的变化而定。
    1955年日本的国际收支盈余高达五亿三千五百万美元，但是如果除去特需订货五亿七千万美元，那末国际收支相反地就要出现三千五百万美元的赤字。日本政府已经制定了所谓经济五年计划，订出了到1960年没有特需订货也能够维持国际收支平衡的远景。可是另一方面却希望特需订货尽可能地长期继续下去，不断地向美国提出了要求增加特需订货的请求。
    更换企业的设备和采用新技术是日本垄断资本加强力量的另一个重要的方面，而在这一方面美国的支持也起了重大作用。日本的几乎整个产业部门的大企业全都接受了外国技术，其中70％是接受美国的技术。但日本的企业为此而支付给外国的技术费，1950年4月至1955年9月即高达4，477万美元，而且企业的活动也受到种种限制。其他还有向外国的借款，到去年九月底止，约达一亿一千万美元（其中美国占60％，加上世界银行的借款，实际美国占96％）。外国资本在石油工业部门占半数以上的股票投资，也达到三千万美元的金额，其中美国占71％。
    上述的这样的日美间的经济结合，成为日本统治阶层屈从美国以及日美军事、政治同盟的基础。
    （三）
    日本的工业生产力已经达到1934—1936年水平的两倍，而且还在进行更换和扩大工业设备，在这种情况下，商品的销售市场和原料的输入市场的问题就越来越严重化了。
    日本政府和经济界对于提高人民生活水平来扩大国内市场，从来就不感兴趣。日本政府所公布的国民消费水平的统计数字，已经超过战前，但是其中没有把中小企业工人、失业者和需要救济以维持生活的数达一千二百万人的庞大人口计算在内。经济企划厅的资料说明，国民总支出中个人消费所占的比率，这几年来上升的趋势已经逐渐缓慢下来。而日本政府和经济界，却一意致力于发展石油、煤炭、化学、钛等所谓新兴工业，并对巩固和扩大军火武器的生产寄予极大的期待。
    日本经济团体联合会的防卫生产委员会，最近作出概算，准备在这几年中，把飞机和武器（弹药和修配契约除外）的生产额，从1954年的约计121亿日元增加十倍、扩大为一千二百亿日元，这个数额相等于目前汽车工业生产的规模。
    然而，众所周知，重要工业原料大部分需要依靠外国供给的日本经济，增加输出比起其他一切来更为必要和迫切。可是，要使输出稳定地增加，就必须加强商品的国际竞争能力，而加强商品的国际竞争能力就需要有可靠的廉价原料的输入，这个问题已成为同美国勾结的日本垄断资本的最大的苦恼。因而，从1950年底以来，日本经济界要求同中国进行贸易的冲动一直没有停止过，而且日趋发展。英国、西德对中国贸易的增加更成了促进这种要求的因素。
    美国唆使日本政府和经济界放弃中国市场，要它们向东南亚市场发展以为弥补。这种考虑和打算，在现在的日本政府和经济界的内部仍然相当广泛和有力。向东南亚市场发展已成为它们最重要的政策之一。
    可是，放弃中国市场的这个基本事实，给执行这个最重要的政策带来了致命的弱点。日本对东南亚市场的输出，大部分是消费品和轻型机器，但是，由于东南亚地区民族工业的发展和中国对东南亚贸易的新发展，日本这一类商品的输出正面临着危机。这个地区的国家，除了若干例外，都在积极地进行开发本国资源和建立重工业，因而确实需要重型机器。然而日本在这一点上却相当落后于欧美各国。根据1953年的统计材料，日本对东南亚的机器类输出，仅仅对泰国一国比较多，但是也只占泰国机械类输入总额的14％，而在其他各处则远不如英、美、西德各国。至于钢铁类的输出，虽然去年白铁板获得占东南亚全部输入73％的数额，可是钢管、型钢却远远赶不上欧美各国。
    日本重工业的这个弱点，不是什么其他原因，根源在于现在日本的原料市场不稳定和不利，这是因为日本经济被不自然地切断了和中国市场的联系所致。日本垄断资本为了克服这个矛盾，残酷地压低工人工资，强迫全国人民负担重税。这样的政策自然要使日本工人阶级和广大人民的斗争日益加剧，因而日本垄断资本的统治也就越来越动摇了。
    日本人民以工人阶级为首，正在展开不屈不挠的反对统治阶层的屈从美国政策，为争取全面展开日中、日苏的贸易而要求恢复邦交的斗争。大多数的日本人民认为：为了建立日本的和平经济，为了日本国民经济的繁荣，日中经济的密切联系是绝对必要的。　　　（本报特约稿）
