France's Embarrassing Situation in Algeria
任学文

    On June 20th, the French Governor-General of Algeria, Lacoste, published an interview in the evening newspaper "Paris News." He reiterated that the French government would continue to adopt a policy of suppression against the Algerian people's armed uprising against colonial rule, and said that this suppression would show concrete results by early winter.

    It seems that the French colonial forces have not learned the historical lessons of Indochina. They have also not drawn the conclusions they should have from the reality of Algeria. Both historical lessons and reality show that in this era, awakened people are invincible.

    The armed uprising against colonial rule in Algeria, which began on the night of October 31, 1954, has not only not been suppressed, but has developed into a larger-scale national liberation war over the past year. Under the leadership of the Algerian National Liberation Front, composed of various nationalist parties and the Communist Party, a national liberation army has emerged in Algeria. This army, with the full support of the vast majority of the people, is growing stronger and stronger, and its activities are spreading throughout Algeria. It adopts guerrilla warfare tactics and constantly strikes the French colonial army in six regions, including the Aures Mountains, North Constantine, Kabylie, Algiers, Oran, and southern Algeria, making the latter exhausted. The French army sometimes launches offensives against the National Liberation Army. Although they concentrate forces that are vastly superior in number and technology, they do not receive the support of the local people and are limited by the mountainous terrain, and therefore often suffer setbacks. For example, in early June, the French army dispatched 6,000 infantrymen to attack the Algerian National Liberation Army in the mountains in an area 100 kilometers east of Algiers. However, this French army could not find the shadow of the National Liberation Army at all, and the only result they obtained was clearing a blocked road. In many areas, French patrols control the roads during the day, but at night it is the world of the guerrillas. In Algeria, there are daily incidents of people's armed forces attacking French military strongholds. The mobile and flexible Algerian National Liberation Army frequently occupies towns and carries out surprise attacks and ambushes on French garrisons and transport teams, and massively destroys French military transportation lines and communication equipment.

    Under the blows of the Algerian National Liberation Army, the French colonialists are in a very embarrassing situation. Almost every Algerian colonialist's farm is guarded by the French army, and French military camps everywhere have become small castles. In Tizi Ouzou, French soldiers sitting in cafes or restaurants with trepidation hang grenades on their belts, rest their guns on their arms, or place machine guns on their laps, in preparation for a sudden attack. Even the cars traveling in the city are armed with machine guns. The city is under martial law, and a curfew is imposed at 9:00 p.m. Under the pressure of the Algerian National Liberation Army, on February 18, the French authorities announced that 6,000 French people had begun to withdraw from an area of 70 square miles west of Oran, along the Moroccan border.

    The activities of the French army in Algeria are becoming increasingly difficult. When the French Deputy Minister of Defense, Le Royer, reported on the military situation in Algeria to the National Defense Committee of the French National Assembly on March 1, he emphasized that the French army was in a difficult situation because the local residents took a hostile attitude towards the French army. He said that when the French army passed through the local countryside, the residents even refused to tell them the names of their villages. He said that the majority of the French army and gendarmes currently in Algeria are constantly fighting day and night, but the combat effectiveness of the French army is very poor. He particularly pointed out that the soldiers who returned from Indochina were very demoralized. They hoped to solve the Algerian problem politically and did not advocate the use of force. He also drew the attention of the members of the National Defense Committee to the fact that large numbers of North African soldiers participating in the suppression of the national liberation movement were deserting. When Lacoste spoke in the French National Assembly on March 8, he also admitted that the situation in Algeria was becoming increasingly complex. He said that the riots had spread to vast areas, and the "rebels" had established their own regimes and formulated their own laws in the territories they occupied.

    In order to deal with the growing Algerian National Liberation Army, the French government has continuously increased its troops in Algeria. The French government not only transferred the French army in Indochina to Algeria, but also transferred the French divisions under the command of the North Atlantic Group to Algeria. In addition, the French government has continuously issued orders to conscript new soldiers and sent reserve soldiers and soldiers who should have been demobilized to Algeria. In early November 1954, there were only 50,000 French troops stationed in Algeria. So far, France has concentrated 400,000 troops in Algeria. French Defense Minister Maurice Bourgès-Maunoury announced again on June 20 that France plans to increase the number of troops stationed in Algeria to 500,000 next year. But as the weekly "France Observateur," published in early April, said: It is inconceivable that military operations against guerrillas can be victorious. In recent military operations, no important guerrilla force has been contained or eliminated. The weekly pointed out that the more severe the suppression, the more the guerrillas develop, and the result is that the Algerian war is expanding more and more.

    France's expenditure in the Algerian war has exceeded its expenditure in the Indochina war. The current expenditure of the Algerian war is nearly one billion francs per day. According to the financial weekly "La Vie Française," "conscription" beyond the prescribed quota alone costs the national economy 500,000 tons of coal and 6,000 houses per year. If this continues, France's financial difficulties will become even more serious.

    The policy pursued by the French government in Algeria has been widely opposed by the French people. The French working people have continuously held strikes and demonstrations to protest against the reactionary measures in Algeria. Even French soldiers refused to go to North Africa. In early October last year, 500 artillery reserve personnel refused to board the train to depart. In early May this year, a train carrying 900 soldiers from Alsace-Lorraine conscripted to Algeria was delayed in Metz for four hours because the soldiers opposed going to Algeria and held a demonstration with the support of the residents of Metz. The increasingly serious situation in Algeria has affected the stability of the French political situation. The French parliament often argues about the Algerian issue. Even within the Socialist Party parliamentary group, there are more and more people who oppose the Mollet government's policy on Algeria. The weekly "France Observateur," published on June 7, estimated that more than one-third of the Socialist Party members of parliament opposed Mollet's policy. There are also differences of opinion within the French cabinet. Minister Mendès France has already resigned because he disagreed with the government's policy on Algeria. If the Mollet government continues to pursue the policy of military suppression in Algeria, its future will obviously not be bright.

    Just as the United States used France's difficulties in Indochina not long ago to squeeze out French influence in Indochina, the United States is now using France's difficulties in Algeria to carry out a conspiracy to squeeze out French influence. Lacoste mentioned in the French National Assembly that some of France's allies were carrying out anti-French conspiracies in Algeria.

    At present, people all over the world, especially the people of Asia and Africa, are opposing France's colonial war in Algeria and advocating that the French government hold negotiations with the leaders of the Algerian national liberation movement. Like the solutions to the Morocco and Tunisia issues, the Algerian issue should be resolved peacefully on the basis of recognizing the national rights of the Algerian people. The French government should learn from the lessons of the Indochina war: France's interests are definitely not in waging a new colonial war, and France's interests can only be maintained through establishing friendly relations with Algeria. The prerequisite for doing this is to satisfy the national aspirations of the Algerian people. The Mollet government should resist the influence of the French North African colonial group, fulfill its promise to peacefully resolve the Algerian issue, and quickly change the current dangerous policy in Algeria.

    法国在阿尔及利亚的狼狈处境
    任学文
    六月二十日，法国阿尔及利亚总督拉戈斯特在“巴黎新闻”这张晚报上发表了一篇谈话。他重申法国政府将对阿尔及利亚人民反殖民统治的武装起义继续采取镇压政策，并且说这种镇压行动到初冬将表现出具体的结果。
    看来法国殖民势力还没有接受印度支那的历史教训。他们也没有从阿尔及利亚的现实中得出应有的结论。历史教训和现实都说明，在现时代里，已经觉醒了的人民是不可战胜的。
    从1954年10月31日夜间开始的阿尔及利亚反殖民统治的武装起义，不但没有被镇压下去，而且一年多以来它已经发展成为规模越来越大的民族解放战争。在各民族主义政党和共产党组成的阿尔及利亚民族解放阵线的领导之下，阿尔及利亚已经出现了一支民族解放军，这支军队由于得到了绝大多数人民的全力支持，正在日益成长壮大，活动遍及阿尔及利亚的全境。它采取游击战争的方式，在奥雷斯山区、北君士坦丁、卡比利亚、阿尔及尔、阿兰及阿尔及利亚南部等六个区域不断地给法国殖民军队以打击，使后者疲于奔命。法国军队有时也向民族解放军发动进攻，他们虽然集中了在数目和技术上占巨大优势的兵力，但是得不到当地人民的支持，而且受到山区地形的限制，因而常常遭受挫败。像六月初，法军在阿尔及利亚以东一百公里的地区出动了六千名步兵向山地的阿尔及利亚民族解放军进攻。但是，这支法国军队根本找不到民族解放军的影子，它们得到的战果仅仅是清除了一条被堵塞的公路。有许多地区，法国巡逻队白天控制着公路，晚上却是游击队的天下。在阿尔及利亚，现在每天都发生人民武装袭击法军据点的事情。机动灵活的阿尔及利亚民族解放军经常攻占市镇，对法国驻军和运输队进行奇袭和伏击，而且大规模破坏法军的交通线和通讯设备。
    在阿尔及利亚民族解放军的打击下，法国殖民者的处境非常狼狈，几乎每一个阿尔及利亚殖民者的农庄，都要由法军守着，各地的法国军营都变成了小城堡。在蒂齐—乌佐，坐在咖啡馆或餐馆里的提心吊胆的法国士兵，都把手榴弹挂在腰带上，把枪靠在手臂上或者把机关枪放在膝盖上，防备突然的袭击。就是在城市里通行的汽车，也都用机关枪武装着。城市都处于戒严状态，晚上九点钟就实行宵禁。在阿尔及利亚民族解放军的压力下，二月十八日法国当局宣布：在阿兰以西七十五英里、沿摩洛哥边境的面积达七十平方英里的地区，六千名法国人开始撤退。
    法军在阿尔及利亚的活动是越来越困难了。法国国防部次长勒荣纳三月一日在法国国民议会国防委员会报告阿尔及利亚军事情况时着重指出：法军处在困境中，因为当地居民对于法军采取敌对的态度。他说，当法军通过当地农村时，居民甚至拒绝告诉他们自己的村庄的名字。他说，目前在阿尔及利亚的法国军队和宪兵。大部分经常日夜作战，但是法军的战斗力很差。他特别指出：从印度支那回来的士兵，士气十分低落，他们希望从政治上解决阿尔及利亚问题，而不主张使用武力。他还提请国防委员会的委员们注意：参加镇压民族解放运动的北非士兵大批逃亡。拉戈斯特三月八日在法国国民议会讲话时也承认阿尔及利亚的局势越来越复杂，他说暴动已经蔓延到广大地区，“反叛”分子在他们占据的领土上已经建立了他们自己的政权，并且制定了他们自己的法律。
    为了对付日益壮大的阿尔及利亚民族解放军，法国政府不断向阿尔及利亚增兵。法国政府不仅把在印度支那的法军调到阿尔及利亚，而且把在北大西洋集团指挥下的法国师抽调到阿尔及利亚去。此外，法国政府还不断下令征召新兵，并且把后备兵和应该复员的士兵派到阿尔及利亚。1954年11月初，法国驻在阿尔及利亚的军队只有五万人，到目前为止，法国在阿尔及利亚已经集中了四十万大军。法国国防部长布歇—莫努里在六月二十日又宣布，法国计划在明年把驻在阿尔及利亚的部队增加为五十万人。但是正如四月初出版的“法兰西观察家”周刊所说的：不能设想对游击队的军事行动能取得胜利，在最近的军事行动中，没有任何一支重要的游击队被牵制住或者被消灭。这家周刊指出：镇压越厉害，游击队就越发展，其结果是使阿尔及利亚战事越来越扩大。
    法国在阿尔及利亚战争中的耗费已经超过它在印度支那战争中的耗费。阿尔及利亚战争现在的耗费每日将近十亿法郎。据金融周刊“法兰西生活”估计，光是在征兵额规定以外的“征召”，就使国民经济每年丧失五十万吨煤和六千幢住宅。长此下去，法国财政困难必将更加严重。
    法国政府在阿尔及利亚推行的政策，遭到法国人民的普遍反对。法国劳动人民不断举行罢工和游行示威，抗议在阿尔及利亚的反动措施。就连法国士兵，也拒绝开往北非。去年十月初，有五百名炮兵后备役人员拒绝登车出发。今年五月初，一列载有九百名从阿尔萨斯、洛林征召去阿尔及利亚的士兵的火车，在麦次城耽搁了四小时，因为士兵们反对开往阿尔及利亚，并且在麦次城居民的支持下举行了示威游行。阿尔及利亚局势的日益严重，影响了法国政局的稳定。法国议会经常为阿尔及利亚问题争吵。甚至在社会党议会党团内部，反对摩勒政府对阿尔及利亚的政策的人也越来越多。六月七日出版的“法兰西观察家”周刊估计反对摩勒政策的社会党议员超过三分之一。法国内阁内部的意见也有分歧。不管部长孟戴斯—弗朗斯已因为不同意政府对阿尔及利亚的政策而辞职。摩勒政府如果继续推行在阿尔及利亚的军事镇压政策，它的前途显然是不会美妙的。
    正如不久之前美国利用法国在印度支那的困难来排挤法国在印度支那的势力一样，现在美国又在阿尔及利亚利用法国的困难进行排挤法国势力的阴谋活动。拉戈斯特在法国国民议会里就谈到了法国的某些盟国在阿尔及利亚进行反法的阴谋活动。
    目前世界各国人民，特别是亚非各国人民都在反对法国在阿尔及利亚的殖民战争，主张法国政府同阿尔及利亚民族解放运动的领袖举行谈判，像解决摩洛哥和突尼斯问题一样，在承认阿尔及利亚民族权利的基础上，用和平方法解决阿尔及利亚问题。法国政府应该从印度支那战争中吸取教训：法国的利益绝不在于进行一场新的殖民战争，法国的利益只有通过同阿尔及利亚建立友好的关系才能保持。要做到这一点的前提，是满足阿尔及利亚人民的民族愿望。摩勒政府应该抵制法国北非殖民集团的影响，实现自己和平解决阿尔及利亚问题的诺言，迅速在阿尔及利亚改变目前的危险政策。（附图片）
