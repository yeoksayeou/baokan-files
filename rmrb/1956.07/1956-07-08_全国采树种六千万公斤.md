Xinhua News Agency, July 5th – Since last autumn and this spring, various regions across the country have collected 60 million kilograms of tree seeds. This figure is more than three times higher than the highest seed collection year in the past.

The seeds collected in various regions are mostly pine, fir, Chinese locust, poplar, acorns, and Amur cork tree. These tree species are suitable for greening requirements, have economic value, and grow quickly.

Forestry departments in various regions have strengthened their leadership over seed collection work and have initially formulated seed source plans. Some regions have also established or improved seed management agencies, carried out seed inspection work, and organized seed collection bases, among other tasks.
