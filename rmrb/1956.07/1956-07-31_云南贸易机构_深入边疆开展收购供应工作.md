Yunnan's trade organizations in border areas such as Dehong, Xishuangbanna, Lancang, Jiangcheng, and the Honghe Hani Autonomous Region are going deep into the mountains to vigorously purchase local specialties such as agave, camphor, tea, homespun cloth, medicinal materials, and animal hides. They are also actively supplying various goods such as printed cotton cloth, towels, salt, matches, and agricultural tools, which are warmly welcomed by the people of all ethnic groups. The province's purchase of local specialties has increased year by year. Agave increased more than eleven times in 1955 compared to 1954, and camphor increased more than nineteen times. It is expected that this year will see further increases compared to last year. The supply of goods to farmers is also constantly increasing. The Lancang Trading Company supplied farmers with 1.12 million jin of salt in 1953, which increased to 2.23 million jin in 1955; cotton cloth increased from more than 7,500 bolts in 1953 to more than 16,800 bolts in 1955. Some deep mountain areas have scattered villages and sparse populations, making it unsuitable to establish trade organizations. Instead, they have organized trade teams to go deep into the mountains, which are warmly welcomed by the masses. When the trade team from Dali Township in Ximeng Mountain went deep into Nanyue Village, young people from the Lahu ethnic group carried baskets on their backs and drove thirteen cattle to greet them. The news of the trade team's arrival in Nanyue Village quickly spread to 17 villages of the Kawa and Lahu ethnic groups. The Kawa people in Wamo Village had not eaten salt for more than three months. Hearing that a trade team had arrived in Nanyue Village, they immediately sent six people to Nanyue Village to buy salt for 103 Kawa families.

    云南贸易机构
    深入边疆开展收购供应工作
    本报讯　云南德宏、西双版纳、澜沧、江城、红河哈尼族自治区等边疆地区的贸易机构，深入山间，大力收购龙舌兰、樟脑、茶叶、土布、药材、兽皮等土特产，并积极供应各种花布、毛巾、盐巴、火柴、农具等物资，受到各族人民热烈欢迎。全省收购土特产逐年都有增加，龙舌兰1955年比1954年增加了十一倍多，樟脑增加了十九倍多，预计今年比去年还有增加。对农民的物资供应也有不断增加。澜沧贸易公司供给农民的盐巴1953年是112万斤，1955年增加为223万斤；棉布1953年为7，500多匹，1955年为16，800多匹。有些深山地区，村寨分散、人口稀少，不宜建立贸易机构，他们就组织了贸易小组，深入山间，受到群众热烈欢迎。西盟山大力镇的贸易小组，深入南约寨时，拉祜族的青年背着背箩，赶着十三头牛来迎接他们。贸易小组到了南约寨的消息，很快传遍了17个佧佤、拉祜族的寨子。瓦莫寨佧佤族已经三个多月吃不到盐巴了，他们听说南约寨来了贸易小组，随即派了六个人来到南约寨，为103户佧佤族人买了盐巴。
