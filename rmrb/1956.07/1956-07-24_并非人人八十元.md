    Not Everyone Gets Eighty Yuan
    Tián Gōng
    Recently, in some cities and industrial and mining areas, department stores and cooperatives have seen a significant increase in customers, and even the counters for high-end consumer goods have become crowded. Among these customers, some are not usually so eager to buy things, but now they have become active. Some are borrowing money from relatives and friends, some are withdrawing savings from banks, some are requesting advance payment of wages from the administration, and some are organizing purchases on credit without money... In short, they want to "seize the opportunity" to buy some things.
    It is said that these people heard Labor Minister Ma Wenrui's speech at the Third Session of the National People's Congress, saying that wages would increase a lot this year, averaging nearly eighty yuan per person; and that the increased portion would be retroactively paid from April 1st; and that many people might be promoted. These people did some calculations, felt that their income was considerable and that they could accomplish much, so they started buying things in advance.
    This is a misconception. Those who make this calculation do not understand that this year's wage reform includes two aspects: on the one hand, wages will be increased, and on the other hand, the unreasonable wage system will be reformed. Indeed, this year's total wage increase is more than 1.25 billion yuan, which is a very large amount, whether from the perspective of the wage growth rate in the past two or three years or from the perspective of the national fiscal budget. However, it should also be understood that this money will be distributed to 15.7 million employees across the country according to the principle of "to each according to his work," the national industrialization policy, and the current wage situation. Due to differences in regions, departments, and types of work, the wage increase ratio and the amount of money received by each person will be different. Taking the industrial, mining, and transportation sectors as an example, the average wage increase for each person this year is 85.2 yuan, but when distributed to each employee, some with high skills and low original wages may receive more than 80 yuan for the whole year, some may receive more than ten yuan for the whole year, some may receive three or five yuan for the whole year, some may only receive a few jiao, and even a few with very poor skills will retain their original wages, with no increase or decrease. Therefore, one cannot think of things as too perfect. If one spends too much money, the result will be "increasing little and spending much," which will lead to avoidable difficulties.
    The psychological "misconception" of the people is related to the one-sided publicity of wage reform by some newspapers and enterprise leaders during this period. When they publicized this wage reform to the workers, they only talked about "relatively large universal increases" and "greatly universal increases," but did not tell the workers that this wage reform can only achieve some increase for the vast majority of workers, and cannot completely solve all the difficulties in the lives of every worker, let alone meet the various new needs of every worker. These newspapers and the leaders of these enterprises should quickly "make up lessons" and fully explain the content of this wage reform to the workers, so as to avoid some people unknowingly bringing unnecessary troubles to themselves in this happy event of wage increases.
    There are also some people who actively buy things because they are afraid that everyone's wages will increase and there will not be enough goods on the market, and that they will not be able to buy them if they buy "late." Of course, after this wage reform, the demand of workers for daily necessities will definitely increase. However, the state has foreseen this situation and made preparations as early as possible. Commercial departments and people's committees in cities and industrial and mining areas have already arranged or are arranging the supply of materials to ensure that workers can buy what they want to buy and prevent prices from rising with wage increases. Light industrial enterprises in various places are also actively increasing the production of various daily necessities. Therefore, blind rush purchases are completely unnecessary. To put it another way, even if the things you need are temporarily out of stock in one place, the money is in your own hands anyway, and you will always be able to buy them sooner or later. Why bother to crowd into department stores and cooperatives in the hot summer, sweating all over, and not necessarily buying things that are satisfactory?

    并非人人八十元
    田工
    近日来，在某些城市和工矿区里，百货商店和合作社的顾客大大增加，连高级消费品的柜台前也拥挤起来。这些顾客当中，有一些人平时并不这样积极买东西，但是现在积极起来了，有的向亲友借钱，有的从银行里抽回存款，有的要求行政上预发工资，有的没有钱便组织赊购……总之，要“抓紧时机”买一些东西。
    据说，这些人是听了劳动部长马文瑞在全国人民代表大会第三次会议上的发言，说今年工资增加很多，平均每人将近八十元；而且增加的部分从四月一日起补发；还有许多人可能升级。这些人算了一笔账，觉得收入不少，大有可为，于是就提前下手大买特买起来。
    这是一个错觉。打这种算盘的人不了解，今年工资改革包括两个内容，一方面要增加工资，另一方面还要改革不合理的工资制度。的确，今年增加工资总额十二亿五千多万元，无论从这两三年来工资增长比例说，或者从国家财政预算来说，都是一个很大的数目。但是，还应当了解，这笔钱是要根据按劳付酬的原则和国家工业化的政策以及现行的工资情况，分配到全国一千五百七十万个职工身上去。由于地区不同、部门不同、工种不同，每个人的工资增加比例和得到的钱数都会不一样的。拿工矿交通部门来说，今年每个人平均要增加工资八十五元二角，但是分配到每个职工身上，有的技术高原来工资低的可能全年增加八十元以上，有的全年增加十几元，有的全年增加三、五元，有的只增加几角钱，甚至少数技术很差的要保留原工资，不增不减。所以，不能把事情想得太美满。如果一旦把钱花过了头，结果“增的少，花的多”，反而招致本可避免的困难。
    造成人们心理上的这种“错觉”，和这一时期某些报刊和企业领导人对工资改革的片面宣传有关。他们对职工宣传这次工资改革的时候，只讲“较多地普遍增加”“大大地普遍增加”等，而没有告诉职工：这次工资改革只能做到绝大部分职工有所增加，不能彻底解决每一个职工生活上的一切困难问题，更不能满足每一个职工各种新的需要。这些报刊和这些企业的领导人应该赶快“补课”，向职工全面地解释清楚这次工资改革的内容。以免在增加工资这件喜事当中，反而有一部分人糊里糊涂地给自己招来不必要的烦恼。
    还有一些人积极地买东西，是怕大家都增加了工资，市场上没有那么多货物，买“迟”了就买不到了。当然，经过这次工资改革以后，职工对日用品的需求一定会增加的。但是，国家已经预见到这个情况，及早进行了准备。商业部门和城市、工矿区人民委员会，已经或正在安排物资的供应，保证职工买到愿意买的东西，防止物价随着工资增加而上涨。各地的轻工业企业也在积极增产各种日用品。因此，盲目争购完全是不必要的。退一步说，你所需要的东西即使一时一地脱销，反正钱在自己手里，迟早总会买得到的。又何必在炎热的夏天，到百货公司、合作社里去挤得满头大汗，还不一定买到称心如意的东西呢。
