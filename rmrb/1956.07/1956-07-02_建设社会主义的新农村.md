Building a New Socialist Countryside

In our country's rural areas, the system of exploitation and the social foundation that breeds it are about to be fundamentally eliminated; the fate of 500 million peasants is about to be completely in their own hands; the lifestyle of small-scale farming is about to become a historical relic. This is an epoch-making change. The "Model Regulations for Advanced Agricultural Producers' Cooperatives" adopted by the Third Session of the First National People's Congress indicates that this great change has already begun.

Everyone remembers that when the Model Regulations for Elementary Agricultural Producers' Cooperatives were first published last November, less than half of the total number of peasant households had joined elementary agricultural producers' cooperatives, and advanced agricultural producers' cooperatives were still in the trial stage. Only six months have passed, and by the end of May this year, more than 90% of the total number of peasant households had joined elementary agricultural producers' cooperatives, and 61.9% of the total number of peasant households had joined advanced agricultural producers' cooperatives. The broad masses of peasants are willing to abolish land dividends and implement the principle of "distribution according to labor." The Model Regulations for Advanced Agricultural Producers' Cooperatives were formulated under these circumstances and embody the hopes of the broad masses of peasants in our country.

The Model Regulations for Advanced Agricultural Producers' Cooperatives stipulate that the land of poor peasants, middle peasants, and well-to-do middle peasants will be transferred to the collective ownership of the cooperative without compensation; draft animals, farm implements, and trees, etc., will continue to be handled separately by paying compensation or other mutually beneficial methods. In the initial stage of establishing advanced agricultural producers' cooperatives, large tracts of timber forests and herds of livestock can temporarily remain in private ownership. During the high tide of cooperation, this method enabled the vast majority of peasants to voluntarily and quickly embark on the road of cooperation, and ensured that draft animals, farm implements, and trees were not severely damaged. Today, as the cooperative movement develops in depth, this method will certainly continue to have the same effect, ensuring the healthy development of the cooperative movement and promoting the rapid entry of peasants who have not yet joined advanced agricultural producers' cooperatives.

The Model Regulations for Advanced Agricultural Producers' Cooperatives point out a bright path for former landlords and rich peasants: to love the country, abide by the law, work honestly, and strive to be a glorious member of the cooperative. The cooperative will, based on the performance of landlords and rich peasants and their participation in labor production, and after examination and approval by the township people's committee, admit them into the cooperative as members or probationary members respectively; those who do not meet the conditions for joining the cooperative will be admitted to participate in labor within the cooperative after approval by the township people's committee. As long as they perform well in the cooperative, they all have the opportunity to become members. Our country has created successful experience in transforming members of the exploiting classes into laborers through peaceful transformation.

There will be another high tide of agricultural cooperation this winter and next spring. By then, advanced forms of cooperation can be realized in the vast majority of provinces and regions. The main task of rural work in the future is to comprehensively consolidate this new type of socialist cooperative economy politically and economically, and rely on it to develop agricultural production on a large scale. Based on the experience of agricultural cooperation and agricultural production over the years, the Model Regulations for Advanced Agricultural Producers' Cooperatives concisely and clearly stipulate the policy of public ownership of land and other means of production, the methods for collecting production funds, the measures for developing production, and the system for business management, organizing labor, and distributing harvests. Applying these methods and systems to deal with certain economic problems left over by some advanced agricultural producers' cooperatives, and revising and supplementing the production plans of some advanced agricultural producers' cooperatives, will certainly strengthen the unity of poor and middle peasants, further develop the agricultural and sideline production of the cooperatives, and consolidate all existing cooperatives.

In order to consolidate advanced agricultural producers' cooperatives, the management committees of agricultural producers' cooperatives in various places should pay attention to ensuring that the income of members continues to increase on the one hand, and ensuring that the public accumulation of the cooperative continues to grow on the other hand. This requires the earnest implementation of the policy of "running the cooperative diligently and thriftily." In the past, some agricultural cooperatives experienced extravagance and waste due to incorrect management policies and improper business management; some agricultural cooperatives once narrowed the scope of production and had a bias towards "single combat" in production due to one-sided production guidance, which aroused dissatisfaction among the broad masses of members. Now, the Model Regulations for Advanced Agricultural Producers' Cooperatives particularly emphasize the importance of "running the cooperative diligently and thriftily," and stipulate many methods to guide agricultural cooperatives to increase production in many ways, strictly economize on expenses, gradually improve the lives of members, and continuously increase the public accumulation of the cooperative.

When peasants hand over the main means of production to advanced agricultural producers' cooperatives, how to appropriately meet the individual needs of members on the one hand, and continuously increase the public accumulation of agricultural cooperatives on the other hand, that is, how to rationally resolve the relationship between agricultural cooperatives and individual members, becomes a major issue that determines whether agricultural cooperatives can be consolidated. During the high tide of cooperation, some comrades were confused by the enthusiasm of the masses, overestimated the consciousness of the masses, underestimated the reasonable demands of individual members, and often consciously or unconsciously overemphasized the interests of the collective, inappropriately neglecting the interests of individual members. Some agricultural cooperatives emphasized "unity" everywhere, even restricting the sideline occupations of members' families, making members feel "stiff"; some agricultural cooperatives excessively restricted the time for members' free activities, and even criticized members for going to the market to buy things, making members feel "tied up"; some agricultural cooperatives one-sidedly emphasized collective needs, "deducting more and distributing less" from the harvest, arousing dissatisfaction among members. Everyone, think about it, if members cannot obtain any material benefits in the agricultural cooperative, and even feel difficulty and awkwardness everywhere, how can they love the agricultural cooperative? The Model Regulations for Advanced Agricultural Producers' Cooperatives fully take this issue into account, and make clear provisions in the general principles and many relevant chapters on how to handle the relationship between the two, and how to appropriately take care of the interests of both the agricultural cooperative and the members. By earnestly implementing these regulations and carrying out necessary political work among the members, this issue can be gradually resolved.

For many years, the peasants of our country have longed for a life without exploitation, without poverty, with diligent production, and with abundant food and clothing. The Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government have led the peasants in a long and arduous struggle in order to build this new life. Now, this wish of the peasants of our country has been fixed in the Model Regulations for Advanced Agricultural Producers' Cooperatives in the form of law. Implementing the various provisions of this charter will surely develop and consolidate advanced agricultural cooperatives, promote and improve agricultural production, and completely build our country's rural areas into a new socialist countryside.

### 建设社会主义的新农村

    建设社会主义的新农村
    在我国农村中剥削制度和产生剥削制度的社会基础，快要根本消灭了；五万万农民的命运，快要完全掌握在他们自己手里了；小农经济的生活方式，快要成为历史的陈迹了。这是一个划时代的大变化。第一届全国人民代表大会第三次会议通过了“高级农业生产合作社示范章程”，就表明了这个大变化已经开始。
    大家都记得，去年十一月份，当着初级农业生产合作社示范章程刚刚公布的时候，参加初级农业生产合作社的农户还不到总农户的一半，高级农业生产合作社还在试办阶段。时间仅仅过了半年，到今年五月底，参加初级农业生产合作社的农户就达到了总农户的90％以上，参加高级农业生产合作社的农户也达到总农户的61.9％。广大农民愿意取消土地报酬，实行完全“按劳取酬”的原则。高级农业生产合作社示范章程就是在这种情况下制定的，它体现了我国广大农民的希望。
    高级农业生产合作社示范章程规定，对于贫农、中农和富裕中农，土地无代价地转为合作社集体所有，耕畜、农具和林木等等，继续采取付给代价或者别的互利办法分别处理。成片的用材林、成群的牧畜，在高级农业生产合作社初建的时候，暂时还可以不变为公有。在合作化高潮中，这种办法使绝大多数农民自愿地、迅速地走上合作化的道路，并且保护耕畜、农具、林木没有遭受严重破坏。在合作化运动深入发展的今天，这种办法一定可以继续发生同样的效果，保证合作化运动健康发展，推动还没有参加高级农业生产合作社的农民迅速入社。
    高级农业生产合作社示范章程给过去的地主分子和富农分子指出了一条光明的道路，这就是：爱国守法，老实劳动，争取作一个光荣的社员。合作社根据地主分子、富农分子的表现和参加劳动生产的情况，并且经过乡人民委员会的审查批准，分别吸收他们入社做社员或候补社员；那些不够入社条件的，经过乡人民委员会的批准，吸收他们参加社内劳动。他们只要在社内表现得好，就都有机会成为社员。运用和平改造的方法把剥削阶级的分子改造成劳动者，我国创造了成功的经验。
    今冬明春还会有一个农业合作化的高潮，那时候，在绝大多数省区就可以实现高级形式的合作化。今后农村工作的主要任务，就是在政治上、经济上全面巩固这种新型的社会主义合作经济，依靠它大规模地发展农业生产。根据多年来农业合作化和农业生产的经验，高级农业生产合作社示范章程简明扼要地规定了土地和其他生产资料公有化的政策，收集生产资金的办法，发展生产的措施，经营管理、组织劳动和分配收获物的制度。运用这些办法和制度来处理某些高级农业生产合作社遗留下来的经济问题，修正和补充某些高级农业生产合作社的生产规划，就一定可以加强贫农、中农的团结，进一步发展合作社的农副业生产，把现有的合作社全部巩固起来。
    为了巩固高级农业生产合作社，各地农业生产合作社的管理委员会都应该注意，一方面保证社员的收入不断增加，一方面保证合作社的公共积累不断增长。这就要切实执行“勤俭办社”的方针。在过去一段时期里，有些农业合作社因为经营方针不对头，经营管理不妥当，发生了铺张浪费的现象；有些农业合作社因为生产指导有片面性，一度缩小了生产范围，发生了在生产上“单打一”的偏向，引起广大社员的不满。现在，高级农业生产合作社示范章程特别强调“勤俭办社”的重要性，它规定了许多办法，指导农业合作社从多方面增加生产，严格节约开支，逐步改善社员的生活，不断增加合作社的公共积累。
    当着农民把主要的生产资料交给高级农业生产合作社以后，怎样一方面适当满足社员个人的需要，一方面不断增加农业合作社的公共积累，就是说，怎样合理地解决农业合作社和社员个人的关系，就成为农业合作社能不能巩固的一个重大问题。在合作化高潮中，有些同志为群众的热情所迷惑，过高地估计了群众的觉悟，过低地估计了社员个人的合理要求，常常自觉或不自觉地过分强调集体的利益，不适当地忽视了社员个人的利益。有些农业合作社处处强调“统一”，连社员零星经营的家庭副业也加以限制，使社员感觉“手头发死”；有些农业合作社过分限制社员自由活动的时间，对社员赶集买东西的事情也要批评，使社员觉得“捆的发慌”；有些农业合作社片面强调集体需要，对收获物“多扣少分”，引起社员的不满。大家想想，如果社员在农业合作社里得不到什么物质利益，甚至处处感到困难和别扭，他怎样能够热爱农业合作社呢？高级农业生产合作社示范章程充分注意到这个问题，在总则和许多有关章节中，对于如何处理两者的关系，如何适当地照顾农业合作社和社员的利益，都作了明确的规定。认真执行这些规定，并且对社员进行必要的政治工作，这个问题就可以逐步解决了。
    多少年来，我国农民就向往着没有剥削、没有贫困、勤劳生产、丰衣足食的生活。中国共产党和人民政府领导农民进行长期的艰苦卓绝的斗争，就是为了建设这种新的生活。现在，我国农民的这种愿望，已经用法律的形式，在高级农业生产合作社示范章程中固定下来了。实现这个章程的各种规定，就一定能够发展和巩固高级农业合作社，推动和提高农业生产，把我国的农村完全建设成为社会主义的新农村。
