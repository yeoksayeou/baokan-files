Starting From a Party Member's Letter

On July 12th, this newspaper published a letter from a Party member entitled "A Leader or a Mouthpiece?". This letter exposed the bureaucratic work style of several leaders in the Zhejiang Provincial Tax Bureau. They pushed many matters that were within their own scope of responsibility to lower-level cadres, without lifting a finger themselves. When reporting work to higher authorities, they had others write their "reporting drafts"; when giving reports to cadres, they had others write their "report drafts"; and even when giving Party lectures to Party members, they had others write their "lecture drafts." They simply read aloud these drafts prepared by others, regardless of whether the listeners were interested, and considered it fulfilling their task. This phenomenon of not using one's own brain and relying on others for everything must be taken seriously by our entire Party, because it reflects the fact that bureaucratic habits are growing in our state organs.

Bureaucratic habits have various manifestations, and what is mentioned here is one of them. Regardless of what kind of bureaucratic habits they are, they are always the remaining poison of the old society. In the old society, people were generally divided into two major categories: officials and those who did things. Officials did not necessarily have to do things, and those who did things rarely became officials. Many officials did not do things themselves, but had others do things for them, so that they could specialize in being officials. In modern terms, such people are complete bureaucratic elements.

Now is the era of the people, and all staff members (including leaders) of our country are servants of the people. None of them are officials riding on the backs of the people. However, many comrades have inherited the corrupt habits left over from the old society to varying degrees. These habits hinder the socialist cause and also hinder their own progress. We must fight to eliminate these habits.

In order to eliminate these bureaucratic habits, we must break all excuses that defend bureaucracy.

"If we don't do it this way, what are so many departments below for?" This is how the leaders of the Zhejiang Provincial Tax Bureau explained their approach. This means that since so many departments have been established below, they should do everything and draft all documents on behalf of the leading cadres, so that the work of the leading cadres can be simplified to the point of "reading aloud." But people must ask in return: "According to you, what are so many leading cadres above for?" Is the task of leading cadres simply to read out speeches drafted by others?

"Letting cadres replace themselves in some work is a good way to train and develop cadres." This is naturally also a "method," but whether it is "good" is worth studying. We have always advocated training cadres in practical work, which is correct. The problem is that training cadres in practical work does not mean that leaders can abandon their responsibilities. In a sense, training cadres should be done on the basis of their abilities, gradually improving them through step-by-step methods. Like in the Zhejiang Tax Bureau, letting new Party members write teaching materials for Party lectures, is this really training cadres, or is it delaying work? Even if it is permissible to allow comrades below to help draft some documents based on the principle of training cadres, it certainly does not mean that leaders can simply assign topics without indicating the key points of the content beforehand, and then make no modifications or supplements afterward, just reading aloud verbatim. In order to write documents on certain complex issues, one can first have others draft them, and then have relevant personnel discuss and revise them before finalizing them. Documents written by the person in charge can also be given to relevant personnel for discussion, and they can be asked to offer their opinions and make revisions, but it is unacceptable for the person in charge to not use their brains at all for some important and complex issues, and to only act as a mouthpiece. In the past, during the reign of Emperor Huan of the Eastern Han Dynasty, Zong Zi, the governor of Runan, and Cheng Jin, the governor of Nanyang, entrusted all government affairs to their "Gong Cao" Fan Pang (Meng Bo) and Cen Yi (Gong Xiao). People at the time mocked them, saying: "Runan Governor Fan Mengbo, Nanyang Zong Zi only nods his head. Nanyang Governor Cen Gongxiao, Hongnong Cheng Jin only sits and whistles." What is the difference between some of our bureaucratic elements today who do not do anything themselves and the likes of Zong Zi and Cheng Jin, who only nod their heads and sit and whistle? Is this the higher level training the lower level, or the lower level training the higher level?

"Leaders should do fewer specific things so that they can always maintain a clear head and consider some issues from a larger and more distant perspective." This is naturally correct. However, some people simply do not use their brains to consider work under the pretext of "maintaining a clear head." They have not considered distant and big issues, nor have they considered near and small issues. If a clear head cannot be combined with practical work and does not affect practical work, what is the use of such a clear head?

The Party Central has always required leading staff at all levels to adhere to the slogan: "The head of the department is responsible and personally involved." Leading comrades in any leadership position should embody these two sentences in their work. Only in this way can we thoroughly overcome the corrupt styles left over from the old society. Our emphasis on personal involvement is not due to a lack of trust in lower-level comrades, nor is it an advocacy of interfering in the work of lower-level comrades in everything, to the point of taking over and replacing them, thereby limiting the initiative of lower-level cadres. If everything, no matter how big or small, must be done by the head of the department himself, then that is going from one extreme to another, turning oneself into a busy and trivial pragmatist, and of course, it will not be possible to motivate all cadres and enable everyone to play their greatest role.

However, to enable everyone to play their greatest role, leading cadres must first play their greatest role. That is to say, they must use their brains more, often help everyone come up with ideas, think of ways, and formulate good plans, good work steps, and good work methods; at the same time, they must take on the most important and difficult parts in their work, creating successful experiences and good solutions to problems there, so as to educate the broad masses of cadres and people and enable them to continuously improve. If the leading comrades of the Zhejiang Provincial Tax Bureau, like those mentioned above, have others write everything for reporting upwards and educating cadres and the masses, then it is not "leadership" at all, but rather like the old bureaucrats who did nothing in the old society. Our comrades are certainly very unwilling to be that kind of person, so they should immediately change their style!

### 从一封党员来信说起

    从一封党员来信说起
    七月十二日，本报发表了一封“是领导人呢？是传声筒呢？”的党员来信。这封来信揭发了浙江省税务局几个领导人的官僚主义作风。他们把许多本来是自己职责范围以内的事都推给下级干部去做，自己不动手。他们向上级汇报工作的时候要别人代写“汇报稿”，向干部做报告的时候要别人代写“报告稿”，甚至向党员讲党课的时候也要别人代写“讲课稿”。他们只把这些由别人起草的稿件照本宣读一番，不管听报告的人是否感到兴趣，就算完成任务。这种自己不动脑筋、一切依靠别人的现象，必须引起我们全党的严重注意，因为它反映官僚主义的习气正在我们的国家机关中滋长着。
    官僚主义习气有种种不同的表现，这里所说的是其中之一。无论什么样的官僚主义习气，总是旧社会留下来的遗毒。旧社会里的人，一般可分为做官的和做事的两大类。做官的人不一定要做事，做事的人也很少能够做官。许多做官的人自己不做事，而让别人替自己做事，以便自己专门做官。用现代话说来，这种人就是十足的官僚主义分子。
    现在是人民的时代，我们国家的一切工作人员（包括领导人员）都是人民的勤务员，谁也不是骑在人民头上的官。但是，不少的同志却在不同的程度上承袭了旧社会遗留下来的腐朽习气。这种习气妨碍着社会主义事业，也妨碍着他们本人的进步。我们必须为扫除这种习气而斗争。
    为了扫除这种官僚主义习气，必须打破各种为官僚主义辩护的借口。
    “不这样的话，下面要那么多科室做什么呢？”浙江省税务局的领导者对自己的作法就是这样解释的。这是说，下面既然设了很多科室，就应当代替领导干部做一切事，起草一切稿件，使领导干部的工作简化到“照本宣读”的地步。但是人们要反问一句：“照你这样说来，上面要那么多领导干部做什么呢？”难道领导干部的任务就是宣读别人起草的发言稿吗？
    “领导上放手让干部代替自己做一些工作，这是培养和锻炼干部的好办法。”这自然也是“办法”，但是否“好”，就值得研究。我们从来都主张在实际工作中培养干部，这是对的。问题是：在实际工作中培养干部并不等于领导上可以放弃自己的责任。培养干部在某种意义上说来，应当在他力所胜任的基础上，采取循序渐进的办法逐步提高。像浙江税务局那样，让新党员写党课的教材，这究竟是培养干部呢，还是贻误工作呢？就算根据培养干部的原则，可以允许让下面同志帮助起草一些稿子，但是这也决不是说，可以允许领导人事前只是出题作文，并不指示内容要点，事后也毫无修改、补充，只是照本宣科。为了写成某些复杂问题的文件，可以先让别人起稿，然后由有关的人员讨论修改，再行定稿。负责人写的文件，也可以交给有关的人员讨论，并请他们提出意见，进行修改，但负责人对于一些重要和复杂的问题完全不动脑筋，只作传声筒，是要不得的。从前东汉桓帝时汝南太守宗资和南阳太守成瑨把一切政事都交给他们的“功曹”范滂（孟博）和岑晊（公孝），当时人嘲笑他们说：“汝南太守范孟博，南阳宗资主画诺。南阳太守岑公孝，弘农成瑨但坐啸。”我们今天的某些万事不躬亲的官僚主义分子，跟只管画诺和坐啸的宗资、成瑨之流还有什么分别呢？这究竟是上级培养下级，还是下级培养上级呢？
    “领导人应当少做些具体事情，以便经常保持冷静的头脑，从更大更远的地方考虑一些问题。”这话自然是不错的。可是，有些人却在“保持冷静头脑”的借口下，根本不动脑筋去考虑工作。不但远的、大的问题没考虑，就是近的、小的问题也没考虑。冷静的头脑和实际的工作结合不起来，对实际工作不发生作用，这样的冷静的头脑又有什么用处呢？
    党中央从来要求各级领导工作人员的口号是：“首长负责、亲自动手。”不论在那一级领导岗位上的领导同志，都应当把这两句话体现在自己的工作中。只有这样，才能彻底克服旧社会遗留下来的那些腐朽作风。我们这样强调亲自动手，并不是对下级同志不信任，或者是主张对下级同志的工作事事干涉，以至包办代替，限制下级干部积极性的发挥。如果不论事情大小，一切都要首长自己来干，那就是从一个极端走到了另一个极端，把自己变成了忙忙碌碌的事务主义者，那当然也就不能带动所有干部，使每一个人都发挥他们最大的作用。
    但是，要让每个人都发挥最大的作用，就必须领导干部首先发挥最大的作用。就是说，他们必须多动脑筋，时常帮助大家出主意，想办法，订出好的计划和好的工作步骤，好的工作方法；同时要在工作中自己担负起最重要的和困难最多的部分，在那里创造成功的经验和解决问题的好办法，以此教育广大的干部群众，使他们不断地得到提高。如果像浙江省税务局的领导同志那样，把一切向上汇报和教育干部群众的东西都要别人代写，那就不是什么“领导”，倒很像是旧社会中那种不做事的旧官僚了。我们的同志当然很不愿意做那种人，那末，他们就应当马上改变自己的作风！
