The Council of Ministers of the German Democratic Republic has decided to reduce its army by 30,000 troops. Not long ago, we also saw news of the Soviet Union reducing its army by 1.2 million troops, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea reducing its army by 80,000 troops, and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam reducing its army by 80,000 troops. Such demonstrations of striving for world peace are so heartening to every peace-loving person!

Those who are not forgetful will recall the results of the United Nations Disarmament Commission Subcommittee's discussions on disarmament issues. The Western countries said they were "peace-loving" and "willing to disarm." But why haven't people heard of these "generous" words being put into practice? The Soviet Union has reduced its army by 1.2 million troops, why hasn't the United States disarmed? Mr. Dulles described the Soviet Union's reduction of 1.2 million troops as "merely making better use of Russia's economic reserves to promote its unchanged goal of dominating the world." According to Mr. Dulles' "theory," disarmament increases the "danger of war," and only expanding armaments counts as "peace-loving." No wonder he is constantly advocating increasing military spending and insisting on testing hydrogen weapons and nuclear weapons in the Pacific. What absurd logic! Even a three-year-old child understands that if one truly loves peace, one will "release the horses to the green hills and store away swords and spears."

Why do the likes of Dulles want to belittle the Soviet Union's decision to disarm and create a kind of "otherworldly logic"? It is very clear that it is because he does not want peace and is afraid of disarmament.

Historically, the fascist Hitler also touted himself as "peace-loving." If the United States is willing to promote world peace, then show something—disarm!

### 美国拿出东西来

    美国拿出东西来
    德意志民主共和国部长会议已经决定裁减军队三万人，在不久以前，我们同样地看到苏联裁军一百二十万人，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国裁军八万人，越南民主共和国裁军八万人的消息，这种为争取世界和平的表现，对于每一个爱好和平的人来说，是多么亲切！
    不是健忘的人都会想起联合国裁军委员会小组委员会讨论裁军问题的结果。西方国家说他们是“爱好和平”的，他们是“愿意裁军”的。但是，现在人们怎么没有听到这些“慷慨的”言词付诸现实呢？苏联裁减了一百二十万军队，美国为什么不裁军呢？杜勒斯先生把苏联裁军一百二十万人说成“仅仅是更好地利用俄国的经济后备力量来促进它的依然不变的目标——称霸世界”。根据杜勒斯先生的“理论”，裁军是增加“战争的危险”，只有扩充军备才算是“爱好和平”。怪不得他一味地宣扬要把军费增加，一定要在太平洋上试验氢武器和核子武器。这是多么荒谬的逻辑！就是三岁的孩童也懂得真是爱好和平，就会“马放青山，刀枪入库。”
    杜勒斯之流为什么要这样贬低苏联裁军的决定，而创造出一种“世外的逻辑”呢？很清楚，因为他不愿和平，害怕裁军。
    历史上，法西斯希特勒都标榜过自己“爱好和平”。如果说美国愿意促进世界和平的话，那么，拿出东西来——裁军！
