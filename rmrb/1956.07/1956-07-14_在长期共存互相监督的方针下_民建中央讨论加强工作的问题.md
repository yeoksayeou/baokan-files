Xinhua News Agency, 13th: The Standing Committee of the Central Committee of the China National Democratic Construction Association (CNDCA) held an enlarged meeting on the evenings of the 11th and 12th to discuss the guiding policy of long-term coexistence and mutual supervision between the Chinese Communist Party and the democratic parties. Huang Yanpei, Chairman of the CNDCA, presided over the meeting.

Those who spoke at the meeting unanimously endorsed the proposal of this significant political guideline. Hu Juewen said that this policy is in line with the interests of the people of the whole country, including the national bourgeoisie, which proves the Communist Party's impartiality. Sun Xiaocun said that mutual supervision cannot deviate from the goal of building socialism, from socialist principles, or from the leadership of the Communist Party; mutual supervision cannot be understood as "mutual opposition and rivalry." Some people at the meeting agreed with this view, while others disagreed. Zhang Yuanshan and others believe that one should not be afraid that mutual supervision will become "rivalry," and that the term "rivalry" should not be mentioned in the future, as this would hinder the correct understanding of this policy and prevent the democratic parties from boldly supervising the Communist Party. This issue was debated, and everyone agreed that it could be discussed further in the future.

Regarding the question of how the CNDCA should conduct its work under the guiding principle of long-term coexistence and mutual supervision, everyone spoke enthusiastically. Some suggested that in order to supervise the Communist Party, the CNDCA must first strengthen its own work; members of the CNDCA must strive to improve themselves in order to better play a supervisory role. Others disagreed with this view, arguing that although the CNDCA has its own shortcomings, it can still supervise the Communist Party; the CNDCA can strengthen its own work while supervising the Communist Party, rather than strengthening itself first and then supervising others. Many people suggested that the CNDCA should guide the private industrialists and businessmen it is associated with to carry out self-reform, with joint public-private enterprises as the main base, in order to accelerate the completion of the socialist transformation. Hu Juewen said that private individuals working in joint public-private enterprises now have many favorable conditions for self-reform, and that once these people's ideology is transformed, their technology in management and production can be better contributed to socialist construction.

At the meeting, many people seriously criticized the shortcomings of the CNDCA Central Committee, such as insufficient collective leadership, insufficient democratic style, and slow improvement of work, and put forward suggestions for improvement. Chen Suiheng called on the CNDCA Central Committee to strengthen collective leadership, carry out bottom-up criticism, and thoroughly examine and correct shortcomings in its work. Bi Mingqi hoped that the CNDCA Central Committee could set an example for local organizations in resolving collective leadership and division of responsibilities, and carry out criticism and commendation to strengthen leadership over local organizations. Zhang Naiqi said that the CNDCA Central Committee is prepared to comprehensively examine and improve its work, and hopes that everyone will offer more suggestions. He said that if the CNDCA is afraid of developing democracy, it cannot assume the responsibility of long-term coexistence and mutual supervision.

Li Zhuchen said at the end of the forum that the CNDCA Central Committee will continue to discuss the policy of long-term coexistence and mutual supervision, and he requested that the CNDCA's local organizations widely organize discussions so that the entire association can have a further understanding of this policy.

    在长期共存互相监督的方针下
    民建中央讨论加强工作的问题
    新华社13日讯　中国民主建国会中央常务委员会在11日、12日晚举行扩大会议，座谈中国共产党和各民主党派长期共存、互相监督的方针。民建主任委员黄炎培主持了这次会议。
    在会上发言的人一致拥护这一重大政治方针的提出。胡厥文说，这一方针符合于包括民族资产阶级在内的全国人民的利益，这证明共产党的大公无私。孙晓村说，互相监督不能离开建设社会主义的目的，不能离开社会主义原则，不能离开共产党的领导；互相监督不能理解为“互相对立，分庭抗礼”。会上有人赞同这一意见，另有些人不同意这个意见。章元善等人认为，不应该怕相互监督就会变成“分庭抗礼”，今后也不要提“分庭抗礼”这个意思，因为这样会妨碍对这一方针的正确理解，并妨碍各民主党派大胆地对共产党进行监督。关于这个问题，曾进行了辩论，大家认为这个问题今后还可继续讨论。
    关于在长期共存、互相监督的方针下，民建如何进行工作问题，大家谈得很热烈。有人提出，要对共产党进行监督，首先民建要加强本身的工作；民建成员要努力提高自己，才能更好地发挥监督作用。有人不同意这样的看法，认为民建本身虽有缺点，但也可以对共产党进行监督；民建可以一面加强本身工作，一面对共产党进行监督，而不是首先加强自己，然后监督别人。许多人都提出，民建要引导所联系的私营工商业者，以公私合营企业为主要基地，进行自我改造，以加速社会主义改造事业的完成。胡厥文说，现在公私合营企业中工作的私方人员进行自我改造有许多有利条件，这些人的思想改造好了，他们在经营管理和生产等方面的技术就可以更好地贡献给社会主义建设。
    会上许多人对民建中央集体领导不够、民主作风不够、改进工作不快等缺点进行了严肃的批评，并提出了改进意见。陈邃衡要求民建中央加强集体领导，开展自下而上的批评，彻底检查并改正工作中的缺点。毕鸣岐希望民建中央能在解决集体领导，分工负责方面为地方组织树立榜样，并开展批评和表扬，以加强对地方组织的领导。章乃器表示，民建中央准备全面检查并改进自己的工作，希望大家多提意见，他说，民建若是害怕发扬民主，就不能负起长期共存、互相监督的责任。
    李烛尘在座谈会结束时说，民建中央还要继续讨论长期共存、互相监督的方针，他要求民建各地方组织广泛地组织讨论，使全会对于这个方针有进一步的认识。
