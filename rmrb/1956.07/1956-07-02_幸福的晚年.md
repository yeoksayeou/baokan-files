Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai: In Shanghai's Cao Yang New Village, many retired old workers are enjoying a happy retirement.

　　Seventy-one-year-old retired printing worker Zheng Jiyu is particularly fond of watching sports competitions such as soccer and long-distance running. Whenever foreign sports teams come to Shanghai for performances or competitions, he goes to watch almost every time, regardless of the weather. The comfortable life in his later years has cultivated a habit of collecting news pictures in this old worker. For more than three years, he has collected the pictures published in the Liberation Daily every day. The achievements of the motherland's various constructions and new things reflected in the pictures deeply move him. He said: "It's really happy to browse through them often."

　　Zhou Gaosheng, a worker at the state-owned Shanghai No. 2 Cotton Textile Factory who participated in the "May Thirtieth" Movement, has now begun his retirement life. On Sunday nights, he often watches movies with men, women, old and young in Cao Yang New Village. Recently, after watching the Soviet film "The Gadfly," he often tells this moving story to his nieces when he cools off in the evening.

　　Listening to the radio has become a hobby for Zhang Yueying, a retired elderly female worker at the joint state-private Shenxin No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory. She likes the new people and new things introducing workers' lives and local operas broadcast by the Shanghai People's Broadcasting Station.

　　Sixty-three-year-old retired worker Yang Houju weeds and waters his small garden behind his house every morning after five o'clock. He has planted more than a dozen kinds of flowers and trees here, which are growing and blooming. In the grape trellis he built with his own hands, it is now full of fruit, and in a few months, he will be able to taste the delicious grapes.

    幸福的晚年
    新华社上海讯　在上海市曹杨新村里，许多退休的老工人正在安度幸福的晚年。
    七十一岁的退休印刷工人郑辑玉，特别喜爱观看足球和长跑等体育比赛。每逢国外体育代表队来上海作表演或比赛时，不论刮风下雨，他几乎每次都去观看。安逸的晚年生活，使这个老工人养成了收集新闻图片的习惯。三年多来，他每天把登在解放日报上的图片收集起来。图片反映的祖国各项建设成就和新事物，使他深受感动。他说：时常翻看，实在开心。
    曾参加“五卅”运动的国营上海第二棉纺织厂工人周高升，现在已经开始了晚年的休养生活。星期天晚上，他常常和曹杨新村的男女老少在一起看电影。最近他看了苏联影片“牛虻”后，常常在晚上乘凉时，把这个动人的故事讲给他的外甥女们听。
    收听无线电广播已成为公私合营申新第一棉纺织厂退休老年女工张月英的爱好。上海人民广播电台播送的介绍工人生活的新人新事和地方戏曲等，都是她喜欢的节目。
    六十三岁的退休工人杨厚聚，每天早晨五点多钟，就在他屋后的小花园里拔草、浇水了。他在这里种植了十多种花木，已在茁长、开花。在由他亲手搭起的葡萄棚里，现在已经长满果实，再过几个月，就能尝到鲜美的葡萄了。
