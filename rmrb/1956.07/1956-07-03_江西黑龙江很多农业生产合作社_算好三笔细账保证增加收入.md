Jiangxi, Heilongjiang Many Agricultural Production Cooperatives
Calculate Three Detailed Accounts to Ensure Increased Income

(Our Report) Recently, more than 5,500 agricultural production cooperatives in the Fuzhou area of Jiangxi calculated three accounts: total income, labor work points, and actual income of members. Through accounting, they discovered problems, improved business management, and ensured increased production and income. In the process of accounting, each cooperative reviewed its production plan and established and improved its labor organization and financial system. In Linchuan County, 646 cooperatives revised their production plans and found more ways to increase production.

Some cooperatives found problems with increasing production in their accounting and could not guarantee that 90% of the members would increase their income. They promptly opened up more avenues for increasing production from various aspects. Cooperatives in counties such as Lichaun, Le'an, and Jinxi have launched more than 30 kinds of sideline production, while also reducing non-productive expenditures.

After the accounts were settled, the cooperative leaders and members felt more confident and became more active in production.

(Our Report) Agricultural production cooperatives in Shuangcheng County, Heilongjiang Province, are generally calculating three accounts: increased production, income, and expenditure. After calculating these three accounts, the cooperative cadres and members have a more accurate estimate of the standards that the cooperative’s production, expenditure, and individual income may reach this year. The cooperative cadres have become clearer-headed, and the members' enthusiasm for production is even higher.

Previously, some cadres and farmers were satisfied that the land was planted carefully and the seedlings emerged evenly this year. After calculating the increased production account, they unanimously requested to further improve summer hoeing production to ensure that crops grow more vigorously. 70% of the cooperatives in the county have formulated summer hoeing production plans and drafted measures to improve weeding, soil loosening, thinning, and topdressing to increase production. The Minhe Cooperative in Wujia Township originally planned to apply topdressing only on one hundred hectares of "ten-thousand-jin-per-hectare land"; now the members unanimously request that in addition to increasing the amount of topdressing on these one hundred hectares, another one hundred and twenty hectares of land that has not been fertilized or has been fertilized less should also be fertilized. Qingcheng Cooperative in Xingfu Township will hoe and loosen the soil more thoroughly on more than 800 hectares of field crops. In addition to improving agricultural production, many cooperatives have studied how to combine summer hoeing with sideline production to increase income from various sources.

In order to ensure increased production and increased income, all cooperatives have mobilized the masses to review the cooperative's financial plan, and have appropriately compressed financial expenditures that should be reduced or postponed. Appropriate provisions and reductions have also been made for personnel detached from production and non-productive labor. The eight cooperatives in Wujia Township originally had 55 cadres detached from production, which was reduced to 21 after calculating the expenditure account.

Many cooperatives have realized the benefits of such accounting after calculating these three accounts: it can truly realize the policy of running the cooperative diligently and frugally, establish the view of comprehensively developing production, find more ways to strive for increased production, and block loopholes that affect increased production and increased income. In this way, cooperatives that could have increased production and increased income may increase production even more and earn more income; cooperatives that could not have increased production and increased income can also strive to increase production and increase income. However, calculating the three accounts must be realistic. If the production targets were set too high in the past, they should be revised appropriately. If some sideline production cannot generate actual income this year, it should not be included in this year's increased production projects, so as not to create false phenomena and cause members to develop blindly optimistic emotions. In addition, when calculating the members' income account, the number of labor days and the quality of work that each member has already done should be checked, so that the members clearly understand that only by working more and better can they increase their income more.

    江西黑龙江很多农业生产合作社
    算好三笔细账保证增加收入
    本报讯　江西抚州专区五千五百多个农业生产合作社最近算了总收入、劳动工分、社员实际收入等三笔账。通过算账发现问题，改进经营管理，保证增产和收入。各社在算账当中，都审查过生产计划，建立和健全了劳动组织、财务制度。临川县有646个社修订了生产计划，找出了更多的增产办法。
    有些社在算账当中发现增产有问题，不能保证90％的社员增加收入，都及早地从多方面开辟了增产门路。黎川、乐安、金溪等县的合作社大都开展了三十多种副业生产，同时，并削减了非生产性的开支。
    算过账，社领导人员和社员都觉得心里有底了，生产更积极了。
    本报讯　黑龙江省双城县农业生产合作社普遍计算增产、收入、开支三笔账。算了这三笔账，社干部和社员对今年合作社的生产，开支和个人收入可能达到的标准有了比较准确的估计，社干部的头脑清醒了，社员的生产积极性更高了。
    以前，有些干部和农民对今年地种的细和小苗出的齐感到很满足。算增产账以后，一致要求进一步搞好夏锄生产，保证庄稼生长的更健壮。全县有70％的社制定了夏锄生产计划，拟定了搞好铲、趟、间苗、追肥的增产措施。五家乡民和社原打算只在一百公顷的“万斤公顷地”上追肥；现在社员们一致要求除了这一百公顷地要增加追肥数量以外，还要把没上粪和上粪少的一百二十公顷地也施追肥。幸福乡庆成社要把八百多公顷大田作物普遍多铲趟一遍。除了搞好农业生产以外，很多社都研究了在夏锄中怎样结合搞好副业生产的问题，从多方面增加收入。
    为了保证增加生产又增加收入，各社都发动群众审查了社的财务计划，对于应当少花和应当缓用的财务开支都作了适当的压缩，对脱离生产人员和非生产用工也都作了适当的规定和削减。五家乡八个社原先设五十五名脱离生产干部，经过算开支账减少到二十一名。
    许多合作社在算了这三笔账以后，体会到这样算账的好处是：可以真正实现勤俭办社的方针，树立全面发展生产的观点，找出更多的争取增产的办法，堵塞影响增加生产和增加收入的漏洞。这样，本来可以增加生产和增加收入的社就可能增产更多，收入更多；本来不能增加生产和增加收入的社也能争取到增加生产，增加收入。不过，算三笔账一定要实事求是地算。过去产量指标订得过高的，应当适当地加以修订。有些副业生产今年不能得到实际收入的，就不要列入今年增产的项目里去，以免造成虚假现象，使社员发生盲目乐观的情绪。另外，在算社员收入账的时候，应当检查每个社员已经做了的劳动日数和工作质量，让社员明确地认识：只有劳动得又多又好，才能更多地增加收入。
