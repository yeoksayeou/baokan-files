I Should Be Given a Job

	In 1950, when I was seventeen years old, I volunteered from school to join the army and took the entrance examination for a certain aviation school to study aviation. Later, I served in the army as a soldier, squad leader, and platoon leader; as a cadet, mechanic, and mechanical officer. I was even credited with meritorious service and was named a model within the regiment. In June 1955, I was discharged from the army and returned to Pixian County, Sichuan Province. Who would have thought that I, filled with enthusiasm to participate in the construction of the motherland, would be unemployed? Because the Pixian County Demobilization Construction Committee emphasized that there was no industry locally and could not arrange a job for me. My wife lives in Chengdu, so I later moved to Chengdu. After moving here, I repeatedly requested the Pixian County Demobilization Construction Committee to transfer my file materials and conscription procedures, but they have consistently refused to do so, saying that higher authorities stipulated that they cannot be transferred. I suspect: Is this really a stipulation from higher authorities, or are they being irresponsible? Zeng Xuelin

    应该让我工作
    1950年，我十七岁的时候，从学校志愿参军，投考到某航空学校，学习航空。以后，又在部队中当过战士、班长、排长；当过学员、机械士、机械员等。还立过功，被团内评为模范。1955年6月，从部队复员回到四川省郫县。谁能想到，怀着满腔参加祖国建设热情的我竟然失业了。因为郫县转业建设委员会强调当地没有工业、不能安排我的工作。我的爱人住在成都，后来我迁来成都。迁来以后，我几次请求郫县转业建设委员会把我的档案材料和兵役手续转来，但他们一直不给办理，并说上级规定不能转来。我怀疑：究竟是上级这样规定，还是他们不负责任？　曾学林
