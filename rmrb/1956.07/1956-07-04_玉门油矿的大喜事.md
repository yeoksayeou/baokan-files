    Great News for the Yumen Oil Mine
    Yang Zhengmin, Director of Yumen Mining Bureau
    The early opening of the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway to the Yumen Oil Mine is a great shock to the oil workers. This is not only a major event in railway construction, but also a great joyous occasion for the Yumen Oil Mine. For many years, the staff and workers of the Yumen Oil Mine have eagerly awaited the early opening of the railway to Yumen. Now, the oil we produce has been loaded onto trains for the first time, passing through the vast Gobi desert, grasslands, and crossing rivers and mountains, to be transported to all parts of the country.
    If oil is the blood of industry, then the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway is a major artery of the oil base. As a base, the lack of convenient transportation is a major drawback. Now that the train goes directly to our doorstep, it is of great significance to accelerate the construction of the oil base and give full play to its role. The loss rate of transporting crude oil by truck is 1%, while the loss rate of transporting it by train will not exceed 0.3%. This means that transporting one thousand tons of crude oil by train can reduce the loss by seven tons. The train transportation time from Yumen to Lanzhou is about forty hours shorter than truck transportation, which is of great benefit to ensuring the quality of oil products. The saving in freight is also considerable. Calculated based on the 1955 transportation volume of crude oil and equipment (from the oil mine to Lanzhou), transportation by train can save more than 28 million yuan. The machinery, equipment, and materials needed for production and capital construction used to be transported by five or six hundred trucks, working day and night in double shifts, and there were often tens of thousands of tons of materials piled up at various stations along the way. In particular, it was particularly difficult to transport some heavy machinery and equipment that exceeded the truck's carrying capacity. Zhao Zhongsan, a model driver who safely drove more than 300,000 kilometers, had to use a truck with a carrying capacity of only ten tons to load eighteen tons of machinery. We also had to use precious aircraft tonnage to rush to transport urgently needed equipment. Due to the backwardness of equipment supply and transportation, the progress plan of capital construction was often disrupted, and the date of putting the project into production was delayed. Due to the imbalance between production, sales, and transportation, the production process was often very tense. The early opening of the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway will ensure that the transportation lines between the oil base and all parts of the country are unimpeded, the valuable oil flows eastward, and the construction equipment comes in a steady stream. The construction enthusiasm of all the staff and workers of the mine will be given fuller play as a result.
    Every year, the Yumen Oil Mine transfers a large number of technical cadres to fraternal units, and at the same time accepts batches of demobilized soldiers, students, and workers who come to support the inland to participate in the construction. Every year, many Chinese and foreign experts, thousands of workers from fraternal factories and mines, teachers and students from universities and technical schools come to visit or intern. These beneficial contacts from all directions will have much more convenient conditions after the train is opened to Yumen.
    The opening of the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway to Yumen has created better conditions for the construction of the Yumen Oil Mine. We guarantee that we will speed up the construction, strive to successfully build the first natural oil base in the motherland in one or two years, find better oil fields, refine better oil products, extract more crude oil, and complete and overfulfill the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule; and we must train a large number of cadres with both ability and political integrity and workers with considerable technical level more quickly to support the development and construction of new oil areas.

    玉门油矿的大喜事
    玉门矿务局局长　杨拯民
    兰新铁路提前通车到玉门油矿。消息传来，石油工人大为震动。这不仅是铁路建设中的大事件，而且是玉门油矿的大喜事。多少年来，玉门油矿的职工殷切盼望着火车早日通车到玉门。现在，我们生产的石油已第一次装上火车，穿过辽阔的戈壁、草原、越过河流和山岭，运到祖国各地去了。
    如果说石油是工业的血液，那么，兰新铁路就是石油基地的一支大动脉。作为基地，没有便利的交通条件是一个很大的缺陷。现在火车直通到门前了，这对于加速石油基地的建设，发挥石油基地的作用，意义是十分明显的。用汽车运送原油，耗损率是1％，用火车运送不会超过0.3％，这就是说，用火车运送一千吨原油可以少耗损七吨。从玉门到兰州，火车运输时间比汽车运输缩短大约四十小时，这对于保证油品质量有很大的好处。运费的节省也是很可观的，以1955年原油和器材的运输量计算（从油矿到兰州），用火车运输就可以节约二千八百多万元。生产和基本建设所需要的机器设备和材料，过去用五、六百部汽车日夜双班运输，还经常有上万吨的物资积压在沿途各个车站上。特别是一些重型的、超过汽车载重量的机器设备，运送格外困难。安全行驶三十多万公里的模范司机赵仲三就曾不得不用载重能力只有十吨的汽车来装载十八吨重的机器。我们也曾经不得不为抢运急用器材而占用宝贵的飞机运输吨位。由于器材供应和运输工作落后，常常打乱了基本建设的进度计划，延迟了工程投入生产的日期。由于产、销、运三个环节不平衡，生产过程也常常是很紧张的。兰新铁路提前通车，将使石油基地和全国各地的运输线畅通无阻，宝贵的石油滚滚东流，建设器材源源而来，全矿职工的建设积极性将因而得到更充分的发挥。
    每年，玉门油矿给兄弟单位输送大批技术干部，同时接纳成批的复员军人、学生和支援内地的工人前来参加建设。每年，有许多中外专家、数以千计的兄弟厂矿的职工，大学和专科学校的教师、同学，前来参观或实习。这些来自四面八方的有益的联系，在火车通车到玉门以后，将获得方便得多的条件。
    兰新铁路通车到玉门，给玉门油矿的建设创造了更好的条件。我们保证一定要加快建设速度，争取在一两年内把祖国第一个天然石油基地建设成功，找出更好的油田，炼出更好的油品，采出更多的原油，提早完成和超额完成五年计划；并且要更快地培养出大批德才兼备的干部和具有相当技术水平的工人，支援新石油区的开发和建设。
