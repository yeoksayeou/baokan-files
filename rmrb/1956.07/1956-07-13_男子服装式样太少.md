    Men's Clothing Styles Too Few
    Summer has arrived, and the girls are all wearing various beautiful clothes. However, the colors and styles of men's clothing, whether it is tops or shirts, are very monotonous. There are even fewer styles of men's sandals. Once, I went to a shoe store to buy sandals, and after looking for a long time, I finally found a good style, but the shop assistant told me that it was for women. I was very disappointed. I hope that our clothing designers and shoe designers can put some effort into this area.

    男子服装式样太少
    夏天来了，姑娘们都穿上了各式各样的服装，真好看。但是男同志穿的，不论是上衣还是衬衫，颜色和式样都很单调。男子穿的凉皮鞋，式样就更少。有一次，我到鞋店里买凉鞋，看了半天才看中一种好式样的，但是店员同志告诉我那是女同志穿的。我很失望。我希望我们的服装设计师和皮鞋设计师，最好能在这方面下下功夫。
