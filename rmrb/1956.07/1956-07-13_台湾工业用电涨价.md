Xinhua News Agency, 10th: According to Taiwan newspapers, under pressure from "U.S. Aid" organizations, the Chiang Kai-shek clique's Legislative Yuan recently passed the "Electricity Price Adjustment Bill," deciding to increase electricity prices for industrial use in Taiwan by 36.4%. Industrial electricity consumption accounts for 77% of Taiwan's total power generation. After the price increase, Taiwan's industrial and mining enterprises will bear an additional NT$83 million in electricity expenses annually. Huang Hui, General Manager of Taiwan Power Company, told reporters that all of the increased electricity revenue each year will be used to repay the principal and interest on "U.S. Aid" debts.

Taiwan newspapers said that this industrial electricity price increase was due to significant pressure from the U.S. International Cooperation Administration's Taiwan branch.

In recent years, under pressure from "U.S. Aid" organizations, Taiwan's electricity prices have been raised multiple times. For example, at the beginning of last year, all electricity prices were increased by 32%. Westinghouse Electric Corporation, which invested in Taiwan Power Company, has also extracted more profits from Taiwan Power Company's electricity price increases over the years.

    台湾工业用电涨价
    新华社10日电　据台湾报纸载：在“美援”机构的压力下，蒋介石集团立法院最近通过了“电价费率调整案”，决定把台湾工业用电电费提高36.4％。台湾工业用电占台湾全部发电量77％。涨价后，台湾各工矿企业每年增加台币八千三百多万元的电费负担。台湾电力公司总经理黄煇对新闻记者说，每年涨价增收的这笔电费，将全部用来偿还“美援”债款的本息。
    台湾报纸说，这次工业用电涨价，是由于受到美国国际合作署台湾分署的重大压力。
    几年来，在“美援”机构的压力下，台湾电力已经涨价多次，如去年初就曾把全部电费提高32％。向台湾电力公司投资的美国威斯汀豪斯电气公司，也从台湾电力公司历年电力涨价中攫取了更多的利润。
