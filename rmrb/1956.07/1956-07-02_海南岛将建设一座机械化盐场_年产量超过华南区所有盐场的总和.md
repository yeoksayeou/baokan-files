Hainan Island to Build a Mechanized Salt Field
Annual Output to Exceed the Total of All Salt Fields in South China

　　The first mechanized salt field in our country—the Yinggehai Salt Field—is currently undergoing surveying.

　　The Yinggehai Salt Field is located between Yaxian and Changgan counties on Hainan Island. In front of it is the deep blue South China Sea, and behind it is the famous Jianfengling primeval forest. Because it is located in the tropical region of 18 degrees north latitude, with high temperatures and strong evaporation, and more than three dry seasons a year, and because it is located at the front end of a sea island like an outstretched fist, without large or small freshwater channels flowing out, the seawater concentration can often be maintained higher than the Red Sea, one of the saltiest oceans in the world. The edge of this salt field has ring-shaped sand dunes as high as ten meters and four to five hundred meters wide, which can block storms and wave erosion.

　　After completion, the Yinggehai Salt Field, covering an area of 3,400 hectares, will produce 500,000 tons of first-class raw salt annually, which is more than the total output of large and small salt fields along the thousands of miles of coastline in South China. The salt purity will reach standards not yet achieved by domestic sea salt, containing 97% sodium chloride, and the cost will be about 60% lower than that of the more advanced salt areas currently. In addition to producing high-quality salt, this salt field will also produce 150,000 tons of chemical raw materials such as potassium chloride, magnesium chloride, and magnesium sulfate, as well as magnesium fertilizer and potash fertilizer, to meet industrial and agricultural needs and accumulate funds for the country.

　　During the Japanese imperialist occupation of Hainan Island, they conducted three years of surveying; when they surrendered, they burned all the drawings. They said: Let the Chinese build it themselves! The Kuomintang sent people to investigate several times, and the result was: it is too desolate and not suitable for construction. The People's Government sent people to conduct surveys starting in November last year, planning to start construction next year and complete it in 1961. At present, the Salt Affairs Bureau of the Ministry of Food Industry, the Liangguang Salt Affairs Bureau, and the Guangdong Provincial Design Institute have sent a large number of personnel to carry out massive surveying, drilling, meteorology, hydrology, geology, harbor observation and other work.

### 海南岛将建设一座机械化盐场  年产量超过华南区所有盐场的总和

    海南岛将建设一座机械化盐场
    年产量超过华南区所有盐场的总和
    我国第一个机械化盐场——莺歌海盐场正在进行勘测。
    莺歌海盐场在海南岛的崖县、昌感县之间。它的前边是蓝得发黑的南海南部，后边是著名的尖峰岭原始森林。由于它位在北纬线十八度的热带地区，气温高，蒸发力强，一年有三个以上的干季，又因为它处在像伸出的拳头一样的海岛前端，没有大小淡水道流出，海水浓度能够经常保持比世界最咸的海洋之一——红海还高。这个盐场的边缘有高达十几公尺、宽四、五百公尺的环状沙丘，可以挡住风暴和海浪的侵袭。
    建成后的莺歌海盐场，在三千四百公顷面积的场地上，将年产五十万吨一等原盐，比华南区几千里海岸大小盐场产量总和还多。盐质纯度将达到目前国内海盐未达到的标准，含氯化钠97％，成本也将比现在较先进的盐区低60％左右。除了生产优质盐外，这个盐场每年还将生产氯化钾、氯化镁、硫酸镁等化工原料和镁肥、钾肥十五万吨，以满足工业、农业需要和为国家积累资金。
    日本帝国主义侵占海南岛期间，曾进行了三年的勘测；在投降时把所有的图纸都烧毁了。他们说：看中国人自己建吧！国民党几次派人调查，结果说是：太荒凉了，不宜建设。人民政府派人从去年十一月开始进行勘测，计划在明年施工，1961年建成。目前食品工业部盐务总局、两广盐务局和广东省设计院，都已派出大批人员，正进行庞大的测量、钻探、气象、水文、地质、海港观测等工作。
