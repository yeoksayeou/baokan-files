		I was greatly encouraged by Chairman Mao's call for "Letting a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend," believing that this move could break the stagnant atmosphere of the past few years. However, to achieve the goal of "Letting a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend," we must first create the conditions for "Letting a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend." Please allow me to offer some opinions on this issue.

		Mr. Zhang Dexin, Vice President of Northeast Normal University, said at the Third Session of the First National People's Congress: "The health of middle school students is not good now. In some areas, more than 10% of middle school students suffer from pulmonary tuberculosis, high blood pressure, headaches, and neurasthenia; the number of those suffering from night blindness is even higher. One of the reasons is that students have an excessive study burden, and they cannot or are unwilling to rest on Sundays; another reason is malnutrition."... "In higher education, most university teachers are busy writing lecture notes, so they have no time to conduct scientific research."... "There are also teachers who simply read their lecture notes in the classroom without vividly elaborating; students are only busy taking notes, and they have no time to understand and appreciate. Therefore, a phenomenon has formed where students take notes in class, compare notes after class, and memorize notes before exams," and so on.

		I dare to say boldly that this phenomenon described by Vice President Zhang is universal throughout the country and also exists at Peking University. Here is such a thing: all the students in a certain class of a certain year in a certain department reflected that most of the courses in their department are conducted according to the following formula: Before class, the teacher writes the lecture notes (without giving them to the students, not even an outline), and then reads them word for word in the classroom, while the students take them down word for word, even including quotation marks, deletion marks, and dashes. The speed is very slow, the tone rarely changes, the pace is almost consistent, so everyone can't hear the key points, can't hear the levels, can't even hear the paragraphs, and there is no time to think at all, because their arms are sore, and they don't want to do anything else. The teacher doesn't use his brain in class, only acting as a record player, and the students are also forced to not use their brains, only acting as inferior stenographers, which seriously affects the efficiency of teaching. In class, students cannot understand well. Students with good grades must review again after class to grasp the content taught by the teacher; students with slightly worse grades must spend another forty-five minutes organizing their notes (filling in gaps, making up for missed copies, and proofreading). In a semester, the teacher gave them a total of thirty-two class hours. According to a survey of notes from five students of different levels, everyone took an average of 57,376 words of notes. This is what this class of students gained in a semester. If these 57,376 words of lecture notes were printed, they could be printed into a booklet of fifty pages, which students could read carefully in a maximum of four class hours, and the effect would be much greater than listening to the lectures. This is equivalent to saying that 87.5% of the students' class time is wasted. It is really disheartening. There is also a teacher who also lectures according to his system. When lecturing, he rarely provides specific analysis and explanations, and when lecturing, he has neither expression nor intonation. The pitch, length, and intensity of the sound hardly change. The students can't understand it in class, so they have to desperately take notes, but because they don't understand, they still can't take good notes. The fastest person took down 150,000 words in sixty-two lessons throughout the semester, averaging 55.3 words per minute. Under such intense physical labor, how can they use their brains to think? Because they don't understand, most students come to preview, but they still can't digest it in class. One student spends a one-to-one ratio of time to preview, but after previewing, they can only understand one-third. But this course is a major course, and it must be learned well, so the vast majority of students spend twice the class time to review. Individual students spend an average of more than twenty class hours per week reviewing this four-hour-per-week course. Because the efficiency of listening in class is low, in this class of more than forty people, the Q&A time for this course has continued for several weeks, taking up fifteen class hours per week. This not only wastes a lot of time but also increases the burden on the tutoring teachers.

		In short, the teaching methods of the above two courses bring immeasurable harm to students. The most important thing is that they not only despise students' ability to accept but also cripple students' independent thinking ability, making it impossible for the brain to function, turning lively and vigorous young people into rigid radios. Under such an atmosphere, how can we cultivate young people with independent thinking ability to achieve the goal of "Letting a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend?"

		Although the above two examples are very prominent and not universal, under today's teaching atmosphere, students do not have ample time to digest and master the theories and techniques they have learned, which affects the cultivation of their independent working ability. This can be said to be universal. We must ask, how did such a teaching atmosphere arise? Although a small part is due to the irresponsibility of individual teachers, according to my personal understanding, most of it should be attributed to today's teaching system. The burden on teachers is too heavy, and their work is mainly focused on writing teaching outlines and organizing teaching materials. In addition, many professional courses are new courses that did not exist before liberation, and everything must be started from scratch. A teacher in the Economics Department of Peking University told me that he prepared more than twenty hours of teaching materials, which was not enough for two hours of lectures. If each course is to have a vivid presentation, I don't know how many more books to read and how much more work to add. Moreover, in addition to teaching, they also have to learn Russian and do research work; sometimes, they also add sudden tasks, such as launching a struggle to criticize Hu Shih's idealism and Hu Feng's counter-revolutionary theories. Social activities cannot be completely ignored, and part-time jobs outside the school cannot be completely abandoned. Wages are generally low, and one cannot help but have some concerns in their heart; if there are many children, they cannot sleep and rest quietly at night, and they also lack a quiet place to prepare lessons during the day. Even if there is time for scientific research, they lack the equipment, materials, and environment to carry out scientific research.

		I sympathize with the students' reflections, but I cannot close my eyes to the teachers' difficulties and not look carefully. We should learn from the Soviet Union, which is an unshakable principle, but should we imitate them mechanically? We should also strive to explore and create experiences. Therefore, it is urgently necessary for the Ministry of Higher Education to vigorously strengthen leadership so that we can get rid of the mechanical teaching system more quickly and get on the track of higher education that combines with China's actual situation as soon as possible. Otherwise, "Letting a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend" may inevitably turn into "Letting a Hundred Schools Argue." Minister of Higher Education Yang Xiufeng also said at the Third Session of the First National People's Congress: "Changing students' mechanical and rigid life, allowing students to have more free time to digest and consolidate the knowledge and skills they have learned, and reasonably develop their hobbies and specialties, and training and cultivating students' independent working ability, is a key issue in improving the quality of cadre training at present, and it must be addressed immediately. In the past, not enough attention was paid to the work of cultivating students' independent thinking ability, and the Ministry of Higher Education is responsible for this in its leadership."

    我也来谈谈百家争鸣
    马寅初
    我听了毛主席的“百家争鸣”的号召，不禁欢欣鼓舞，认为此举可以打破过去几年的沉闷空气。但是欲达到“百家争鸣”的目的，必须首先创造“百家争鸣”的条件，对这问题，请许我提出些意见。
    东北师范大学副校长张德馨先生在第一届全国人民代表大会第三次会议上说：“现在中学生的健康情况不好。有些地区的中学生患肺结核、高血压、头痛和神经衰弱等症者超过10％；患夜盲症者尚不止此数。原因的一方面是学生学习负担过重，星期天都不能休息或不肯休息；另一方面营养不良也是一个原因。”……“在高等教育中，现在多数的大学教师忙于写讲义，因此无暇进行科学研究。”……“还有这样的教师，他在讲堂上只是念讲稿，不能生动地发挥；学生就只忙着写笔记，根本顾不上去理解、体会。因此，形成了学生上课抄笔记，下课对笔记；考试前背笔记的现象”云云。
    我敢大胆地说，张副校长所说的这种现象，在全国范围内是普遍的，在北京大学也存在着。这里有这样的事情，某系某年级的某班全体学生反映，他们科里的大部分课程是按照这样一个公式进行的：课前先生写好讲稿（不发给同学，甚至连提纲也不发），到课堂上一字一句地念出来，同学在下面一字一句地记下来，连引号、删节号、破折号也念出来。速度很慢，声调很少变化，快慢也几乎一致，大家听不出重点，听不出层次，甚至连段落也听不出，根本没有思考的时间，因为手臂酸痛，也不想再干别的了。先生在堂上不用脑子，只是起了一架留声机的作用，同学也被迫无法用脑子，只是起了一个劣等速记员的作用，这就严重地影响了教课的效率。在课堂上，同学们不能很好地理解，程度好的学生，课后必须再复习一遍，才能掌握先生讲授的内容；程度稍差一点的同学，更要花四十五分钟去整理笔记（补漏、补抄和校对）。在一个学期里，先生一共给他们讲了三十二学时的课。根据五个不同程度的同学的笔记调查，大家平均记下了五万七千三百七十六个字的笔记。这就是这班同学一学期的收获。倘把这五万七千三百七十六个字的讲稿印出来，可以印成五十页纸的一本小册子，学生最多花四个学时就可以比较仔细地看完，而效果也会比听讲大得多。这等于说学生有87.5％的上课时间被浪费掉了。说起来实在令人寒心。还有一位先生也按照他的系统讲，在讲课时很少具体分析说明，讲起来既没有表情，又没有抑扬顿挫，音调、音长、音强几乎没有变化。同学们当堂不能听懂，于是只好拼命记笔记，但因为听不懂，笔记仍记不好。记得最快的在全学期六十二节课中记下了十五万个字，平均每分钟记五十五点三个字。在这样紧张的体力劳动下，还有什么方法来利用思考呢？因为听不懂，所以绝大部分学生就来预习，但仍然不能当堂消化。有一位同学用一比一的时间来预习，预习后，仍然只能听懂三分之一。但这门课是主要课，非学好不可，绝大多数同学就拿出学时一倍的时间来复习，个别同学在复习这门每周四学时的课，平均每周要化二十学时以上的时间。因为上课听讲效率低，在这四十多人的班上，这门课的答疑时间曾继续几周，每周就要用十五学时，这样不但浪费了许多时间，也加重了辅导先生的负担。
    总之，以上两个课程的教课方式带给学生的危害是难以计算的。最主要的不但蔑视学生的接受能力，而且残害了学生的独立思考机能，使脑子无法进行活动，把生龙活虎似的青年变成死板板的收音机。在这样的风气之下，怎样能培养出有独立思考能力的青年来达到“百家争鸣”的目的呢？
    以上两个例子虽然是很突出的，不是普遍的，但在今日的教学风气之下，学生没有充裕时间来消化掌握所学的理论和技术，因而也就影响了他们的独立工作能力的培养，这可以说是普遍的。我们要问，怎样会产生这样的教学风气呢？虽然一小部分是由于个别教师的不负责任，但据我个人的了解，大部分应由今日的教学制度负责。教师的负担太重，他们的工作主要的是放在编写教学大纲和整理教材。加以很多专业课程是新开课程，为解放前所没有的，一切都要从头做起。北大经济系有一位教师告诉我，他实足预备了二十几个小时的教材还不够二小时的讲授云云。若每门课程要有生动的发挥，不知还要看多少书，还要加上多少工作。况且教学之外，又要学习俄文和做研究工作；有时还加上突击任务，如展开对胡适的唯心主义思想、胡风的反革命理论的批判的斗争。社会活动也不能完全不管，校外兼职不能全部摆脱。工资一般都低，心中不能不有一种顾虑；若小孩一多，晚间不能安静地睡觉和休息，日中也缺乏安静的地方备课，就是有了科学研究的时间，也缺乏进行科学研究的设备资料和环境。
    我对同学们的反映很表同情，但对教师们的困难，也不能闭着眼睛，不仔仔细细地看一看。我们应向苏联学习，这是不能动摇的原则，但是不是要依样画葫芦地学习。我们自己也应努力摸索创造经验，因此迫切地需要高等教育部大力加强领导，使我们能更快地脱离机械式的教学制度，早日走上结合中国实际情形的高等学校轨道。不然的话，“百家争鸣”难免变成“百家争吵”。高等教育部杨秀峰部长在第一届全国人民代表大会第三次会议上也说：“改变学生机械刻板的生活，使学生能有较充裕的自由支配的时间，消化、巩固所学的知识、技能，并合理的发挥自己的爱好和特长，锻炼和培养学生独立工作能力，这是当前提高培养干部质量的一个关键问题，必须立即着手加以解决。过去对于培养学生独立思考能力的工作注意不够，高等教育部在领导上是有责任的。”
