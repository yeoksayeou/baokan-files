Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, 18th July (Reporter Wang Dian): Yunnan Province, in a comprehensive review of the implementation of its ethnic policies, has found that some Party organizations still lack a proactive attitude in cultivating ethnic minority cadres. Based on this situation, the Yunnan Provincial Committee of the CPC has formulated a new plan to improve this work.

According to statistics from the Organization Department of the Provincial Committee, in recent years, the province has cultivated more than 17,000 ethnic minority cadres. In particular, with the great development of the cooperative movement in inland Yunnan and the victorious implementation of democratic reforms in the border regions, more than 35,000 outstanding members of various ethnic groups have been admitted into the Party, and there are now more than 5,000 ethnic minority cadre Party members. However, the proportion and distribution of these ethnic minority cadres among the various ethnic groups are still very uneven. For example, cadres of the Bai, Naxi, and Hui nationalities account for 6 to 9 per thousand of their respective total populations, cadres of the Yi, Dai, and Hani nationalities account for 2 to 3 per thousand of their total populations, while cadres of the Miao, Yao, Kawa, and Lisu nationalities account for only 1 per thousand of their total populations. The disparities in regional distribution are also significant. In the Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture, ethnic minority cadres account for 47.2% of the total number of cadres in the prefecture, and in the Dehong Dai-Jingpo Autonomous Prefecture, ethnic minority cadres account for 36.1% of the total number of cadres in the prefecture. However, in Guangnan County, where more than 38,000 Miao people live, there are only nine Miao cadres in the entire county. There are even fewer ethnic minority cadres in high-altitude mountainous areas. In terms of cadre quality, there is also a lack of a proactive attitude in boldly promoting ethnic minority cadres. Among the ethnic minority cadre Party members in the province, there are only 22 ethnic minority cadres at or above the deputy county Party secretary level. Some ethnic minority cadres who have been promoted to county-level leading positions in the Party and government have not been able to better play an active role in their work because they have not received enough daily assistance. In terms of the training of ethnic minority technical cadres, not enough attention has been paid to it over the past few years. At present, there are only eight technical personnel from the local ethnic groups in the agricultural, forestry, and water conservancy professional systems in the four autonomous prefectures (districts) of Xishuangbanna, Dehong, Honghe, and Nujiang. Among the health cadres in various special districts in the interior, there are only 26 technical personnel from ethnic minorities. This situation is clearly not in line with the requirements of ethnic work in the multi-ethnic province of Yunnan.

The review also showed that some county Party committee leading organs and leading cadres do not attach great importance to the work of cultivating ethnic minority cadres; in particular, less work has been done to cultivate cadres from some ethnic groups that are currently economically and culturally backward. Some Han cadres underestimate the role and ability of ethnic minority cadres, even comparing their qualifications and education with them, thus restricting the bold promotion of ethnic minority cadres to leading positions, or mistakenly regarding the promotion of ethnic minority cadres as simply arranging positions for them, lacking patient and sincere assistance.

Among the existing ethnic minority cadres, some shortcomings have also emerged due to the relatively limited education in Marxism-Leninism. They either fail to reflect the real needs of their ethnic groups, or they are too impatient to complain about the backwardness of their ethnic groups, attempting to catch up with advanced ethnic groups in one step, thus becoming detached from the people of their ethnic groups.

The Yunnan Provincial Committee of the CPC has pointed out to Party organizations at all levels that it is necessary to educate all Party members through a review of the implementation of ethnic policies, criticize and overcome erroneous ideas in the work of cultivating ethnic minority cadres, actively strengthen assistance to ethnic minority cadres through effective methods, and regard improving patriotism, socialist consciousness, and the style of linking with the masses as the main and regular subjects of education for ethnic minority cadres. Boldly promote them to leading positions. The new plan requires that in the next two years, in counties in inland Yunnan where ethnic minorities account for 25% of the total population, ethnic minority cadres should account for at least 20% of the total number of cadres, and there should be key leading cadres from ethnic minorities; in counties where ethnic minority people account for more than 60%, ethnic minority cadres should reach 50% of the total number of cadres. In areas in the border regions of Yunnan that have completed democratic reforms, local ethnic minority leading cadres should account for 40% to 50% of cadres at the same level next year. Various professional systems should also immediately strengthen the training of ethnic minority technical cadres. At the same time, actively and earnestly develop Party organizations. By 1960, Party branches should be established in every township in all types of ethnic minority areas throughout the province.

### 积极培养民族干部  中共云南省委作出新规划

    积极培养民族干部
    中共云南省委作出新规划
    新华社昆明18日电　新华社记者王甸报道：云南省在民族政策执行情况的全面检查中，发现若干党的组织在培养少数民族干部方面还缺乏积极的态度。中共云南省委根据情况作出了改进这一工作的新规划。
    据省委组织部统计，几年来，全省已培养少数民族干部一万七千多人，特别是在云南内地合作化运动的大发展和边疆民主改革的胜利进行中，已有三万五千多个各民族优秀分子被吸收入党，干部党员也已有五千多人。但是，这些少数民族干部在各民族的比例和分布状况上还很不平衡，如民家、纳西、回族的干部已占本民族总人口的千分之六至九，彝、傣、哈尼等族干部已占本族人口的千分之二至三，而苗、瑶、佧瓦、傈僳等族干部还只占本族人口的千分之一。在地区分布上悬殊也很大，西双版纳傣族自治州的民族干部已占全州干部总数的47.2％，德宏傣族景颇族自治州民族干部已占全州干部的36.1％，但是在三万八千多苗族人民聚居的广南县，全县苗族干部还只有九人。高寒山区的少数民族干部则更少。在干部质量上，也反映了对民族干部缺乏以积极态度大胆提拔的缺点。全省少数民族的干部党员中，县委副书记以上的民族干部还只有二十二人，若干已被提拔到党和政府的县级领导岗位上的民族干部，又因为对他们日常的帮助不够，所以在工作中还不能更好地发挥积极作用。在对少数民族技术干部的培养方面，几年以来更没有足够重视，现在，西双版纳、德宏、红河、怒江等四个自治州（区）的农林水利专业系统中，本民族的技术人员还只有八人；内地各个专区的卫生干部中，少数民族的技术人员才二十六人。这种情况显然与多民族的云南省的民族工作要求不相适应。
    检查的情况同时表明：在一部分县委领导机关和领导干部中，对培养民族干部工作很不重视；特别是对某些目前在经济、文化上处于落后状态的民族，培养他们自己的干部的工作，做得更少。还有一些汉族干部，低估少数民族干部的作用和能力，甚至和他们比资格、比文化，因此也限制了大胆地把民族干部提拔到领导岗位上来，或者错误地把提拔民族干部看作是安排位置，对他们缺乏耐心真诚的帮助。
    在现有的少数民族干部中，由于接受马克思列宁主义教育比较少，也产生了一些缺点。他们或则是不注意反映本民族真实要求，或则是过于急躁地埋怨本民族落后，企图一步赶上先进民族，因而脱离了本族的人民群众。
    中共云南省委已向各级党的组织指出：必须通过对民族政策执行情况的检查，教育全体党员，批判和克服在培养民族干部工作方面的错误思想，以有效的办法积极加强对少数民族干部的帮助，把提高爱国主义和社会主义觉悟和联系群众的作风，作为教育民族干部主要的和经常的课题。大胆地提拔他们到领导岗位上来。新的规划要求在今明两年内，云南内地少数民族人口占总人口25％的县，民族干部至少占干部总数的20％，并应有少数民族的主要领导干部；在少数民族人民占60％以上的县，民族干部应达到干部总数的50％。在云南边疆已完成民主改革地区，明年当地民族的领导干部应有同级干部的40％至50％。各专业系统也应立即加强对少数民族技术干部的培养。同时，积极和严肃地发展党的组织，到1960年，应在全省各种类型的少数民族地区，每一个乡都建立党的支部。
