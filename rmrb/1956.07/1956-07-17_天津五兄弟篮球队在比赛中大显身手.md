After the game started, the "Brothers Basketball Team" gained the advantage, scoring three consecutive baskets within four minutes. At this point, the opposing team organized a counterattack, and the battle became very fierce thereafter. The result of the first half was a 31-17 lead for the "Brothers Basketball Team." At the beginning of the second half, the "Brothers Basketball Team" pressed their advantage, keeping the opposing team in a passive position throughout.

Li Shiying has eight brothers in total (and three sisters). Except for the two younger brothers who are too young and the fourth brother who has already joined the army, they often practice basketball under the guidance of their uncle, Li Wenzheng.

Since its establishment in 1954, the "Brothers Basketball Team" has regularly practiced sprinting, jumping, and basketball skills. The oldest player is thirty-three years old, and the youngest is twenty-one years old. Among them are lathe operators, assemblers, as well as accounting and planning staff.
