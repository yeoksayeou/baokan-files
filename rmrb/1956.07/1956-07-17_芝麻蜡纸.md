    Sesame Wax Paper
    The Ding brand No. 4 steel pen wax paper produced by the Shanghai Kaicheng Stationery Factory is of very poor quality. When the wax paper is attached to the mimeograph machine, it can only print a few sheets before many dense little dots appear on the snow-white paper, so we all call it "sesame wax paper." With this kind of wax paper, if too little ink is used, the printed characters are unclear; if too much is used, the small black dots and the characters are indistinguishable, just like printing dark blue characters on light blue paper. This wax paper is probably made with wax that is too thin. We hope the Kaicheng Stationery Factory will quickly research and improve it.

    芝麻蜡纸
    上海开成文具厂生产的鼎牌四号钢笔蜡纸，质量太坏。把蜡纸贴在油印机上，印不了几张，雪白的纸便印上许多密密麻麻的小点，所以我们都称它为“芝麻蜡纸”。用这种蜡纸，油墨放少了，印刷的字迹不清，放多了，小黑点和字迹不分，就像用浅蓝色的纸印深蓝色的字一样。这种蜡纸可能是用蜡太薄，希望开成文具厂赶快研究改进。
