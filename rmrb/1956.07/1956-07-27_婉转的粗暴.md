    Subtle Rudeness
    Tu'an
    The ancients valued "establishing words," regarding it as a matter of enduring significance, and therefore never took it lightly. This cautious attitude is worth learning from. However, some people have a different understanding of caution. Whenever someone raises a question or requests an answer, they always "cautiously" say: "Consider it and then respond," "Study it and then respond." And they never answer when they can "consider" or "study" to a conclusion. In reality, it often sinks without a trace, with no follow-up.
    Take the work of opera reform, for example. The achievements of the past few years should be affirmed, but some problems have also arisen. In addition to the openly "rude" style of some cadres, there are other cadres who, for plays they consider not very good or not very meaningful, do not directly express affirmative or negative opinions, but simply say: "Let's consider it further!" As a result, certain plays—even a large number of plays—are relegated to the cold palace. This remark seems to be made out of "caution," but in the end, it becomes the bullet that executes the plays. Isn't this considered "rude"? Artists put it well, this is "subtle rudeness."
    If it's just some insignificant issue, or the person being consulted isn't the final decision-maker, then letting them be "cautious" is not important. Unfortunately, the issues are often important, and those being consulted are often leading cadres who carry considerable weight. Thus, many valuable rationalization proposals, inventions, and creations are sacrificed under their "caution"; at least they are temporarily unable to see the light of day.
    For the sake of caution, they dare not "establish words," saying "take it slowly," which in itself is a kind of "word." But it does not show the "caution" of the speaker, but rather reflects their irresponsibility, the consequence of which is a huge loss in work.

    婉转的粗暴
    屠岸
    古人重“立言”，把它看作是千秋万载的事，因此决不马虎。这种慎重的态度，是值得学习的。但有些人对于慎重的理解，却有所不同。他们凡是遇到别人提出问题，要求回答时，总是
  “慎重”地说：“考虑考虑再说”，“研究研究再说”。而且决不回答什么时候可以“考虑”或“研究”出结果来。实际上往往是石沉大海，没有下文。
    就拿戏曲改革工作来说吧，几年来的成绩是应该肯定的，但也发生了一些问题。除了一些干部公开的“粗暴”作风外，另有一些干部，他们对于自己认为不大好或意义不大的戏，总是不干脆地发表肯定或否定的意见，只是说：“再考虑考虑吧！”于是这样一来，某些剧目——甚至是大批剧目便被打入冷宫。这话似乎原是为了“慎重”而说的，但结果成了枪毙剧目的子弹了。这算不算得“粗暴”呢？艺人们说得好，这是“婉转的粗暴”。
    如果只是些无关宏旨的问题，或者被请教的也并非最后决定可否的人，那么让他“慎重”一下也是无关重要的。令人遗憾的是，问题往往是重要的，被请教的也往往是举足轻重的领导干部。于是许多有价值的合理化建议，发明创造，等等，都在他们的“慎重”下牺牲了；至少要暂时不得见天日。
    为了慎重，因而不敢“立言”，说是“慢慢来”，这本身就是一种“言”。但它并没有显示出立言者的“慎重”，却反映了他们的不负责任，其后果是工作上遭受巨大的损失。
