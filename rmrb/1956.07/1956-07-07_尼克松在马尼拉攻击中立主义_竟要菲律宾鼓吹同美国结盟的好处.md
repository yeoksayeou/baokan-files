Xinhua News Agency, July 5th dispatch from Manila: U.S. Vice President Nixon attacked neutralism in Manila yesterday and touted the "benefits" of military alliances with the United States.

In a speech delivered at a celebration in Manila commemorating the tenth anniversary of Philippine independence, Nixon said, "A country that refuses the principle of collective security because it fears that cooperation with other countries will damage its independence does not correctly understand the trends of modern history. Standing with free nations has far more benefits than continuing to maintain a detached attitude."

In this speech, which was promoted as "speaking to Asians," Nixon expressed hope that the Philippines "play an important role" in promoting the "benefits" of U.S. military alliances to Asians on behalf of the United States. He said that the Philippines has "very favorable conditions" to do this promotional work, one of which is that the Philippines is an Asian nation. He said, "You can help eliminate misunderstandings and hostility formed due to past mistakes. You can speak for us as someone who knows and understands."

While Nixon was giving his speech, heavy rain poured down, and the people attending the meeting scattered and fled, so he had to shorten his long speech.

    尼克松在马尼拉攻击中立主义
    竟要菲律宾鼓吹同美国结盟的好处
    据新华社5日讯　马尼拉消息：美国副总统尼克松昨天在马尼拉攻击中立主义，并且鼓吹同美国缔结军事联盟的“好处”。
    尼克松在马尼拉一个庆祝菲律宾独立十周年纪念大会上发表的演说中说，“一个国家如果因为怕同其他国家合作它的独立将受到损害而因此拒绝集体安全的原则，那末这个国家是没有正确地了解现代历史的趋势。同自由国家站在一起比继续保持超然态度的好处多得多。”
    尼克松在这一篇被宣传为“向亚洲人说话”的演说中，表示希望菲律宾“发挥重要的作用，”能替美国向亚洲人宣传美国的军事联盟的“好处”。他说，由菲律宾来做这种宣传工作具有“非常有利的条件”，其中之一就是菲律宾是亚洲民族。他说，“你们可以帮助消除由于过去的错误而形成的误解和敌意。你们可以作为一个知道和了解的人代替我们说话。”
    在尼克松发表演说的时候，大雨倾盆而下，参加大会的人四散奔逃，他只好缩短了他的长篇演说。
