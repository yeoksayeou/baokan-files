    Xinhua News Agency, Naha, 30th: Under the slogans of defending basic human rights and defending their homeland, approximately 150,000 residents of Okinawa held a rally at Naha High School on the evening of the 28th, resolutely opposing the U.S. forcible seizure of land on Okinawa to expand military bases.
    That evening, the U.S. military dispatched a large number of military police to be stationed at important locations throughout the city, and the atmosphere in the city was tense.
    At the rally, speakers unanimously expressed their determination to further implement the four principles of "not selling an inch of land to the U.S.," "opposing lump-sum payments for military land rent," and others.
    The rally passed a resolution to send a delegation composed of leaders from the opposition party, the Socialist Masses Party, to Japan to petition, and to demand that the Ryukyu government rescind its recent decision to restrict rallies in schools. The rally also passed a resolution demanding the resignation of Higa Shuhei, the U.S.-appointed Chief Executive of the Ryukyu government, and Toma, the mayor of Naha City. Participants at the rally pointed out that Higa Shuhei adopted a passive attitude on the Okinawa land issue, while Mayor Toma expressed his support for the U.S. to pay land rent in a lump sum, a method of payment that would effectively buy the land ownership of the Okinawa residents.
    Prior to the rally, approximately one thousand students held a demonstration march in the city. They shouted slogans such as "Yankees go home!"

    坚决反对美国强征土地
    冲绳岛十五万人集会
    新华社30日讯　那霸消息：在保卫基本人权和保卫家乡的口号下，冲绳岛约有十五万居民二十八日晚间在那霸市高级中学举行大会，坚决反对美国强征冲绳岛的土地来扩建军事基地。
    当晚，美军出动了大批宪兵在市内各重要地点戒备，全市空气紧张。
    在大会上，发言的人们一致表示决心进一步努力贯彻“一坪土地不卖给美国”、“反对一次付清军用土地租金”等四项原则。
    大会通过决议，要派遣由反对党社会大众党的领导人组成的代表团到日本进行请愿，并且要求琉球政府撤销它最近宣布的限制在学校举行集会的决定。大会还通过决议要求美国任命的琉球政府行政主席比嘉秀平和那霸市市长东间辞职。参加大会的人们指出，比嘉秀平在冲绳土地问题上采取消极的态度，同时，市长东间表示赞成美国一次付清土地租金，这种支付租金的办法实际上是要买取冲绳居民的土地所有权。
    在大会召开以前，约一千名学生在市内举行了示威游行。他们高呼“美国佬滚回去！”的口号。
