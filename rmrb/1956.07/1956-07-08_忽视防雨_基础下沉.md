Ignoring Rain Protection, Foundations Settle

(Reported by our newspaper) The Second Engineering Division of the North China Taiyuan Engineering Bureau has neglected rain protection in rainy season construction and has not resolved drainage problems at the construction site, resulting in rainwater entering foundation projects and causing foundation settlement accidents for several consecutive days. On June 2nd, the foundation of a certain workshop settled, causing cracks in the walls and separation of the roof panels, extending the construction period by more than half a month. However, the Second Engineering Division did not learn from this lesson and strengthen rain protection measures. On June 20th, a similar accident occurred at the south end column base of another workshop.

    忽视防雨　基础下沉
    本报讯　华北太原工程局第二工程处忽视雨季施工中的防雨工作，一直没有解决施工现场的排水问题，以致雨水灌入基础工程，连日发生基础下沉事故。六月二日因某号工房基础下沉，使墙面裂缝、屋面板拉开，延长工期达半个多月之久。但第二工程处并没有接受教训，加强防雨措施。六月二十日另一号工房南端柱基又发生同类事故。
