Protests Echo from Okinawa to Japan
Osaka Rally Against US Occupation of Okinawa

By our reporter Pei Da, Tokyo, July 2nd – On July 1st, Osaka resounded with songs of anger:
	"Going to the sea, cannot catch fish
	Going to the mountains, cannot gather firewood
	Ah! The sea and mountains of Okinawa
	Atomic cannons are roaring
	Okinawa, enduring for ten years
	Today we must stand up
	...Extremely tyrannical America
	Look at our strength!"
	
That day, early in the morning, tens of thousands of people from Osaka, Hyogo, Wakayama, Nara, and other prefectures poured into Nakanoshima Park in Osaka from all directions. Many of them were Okinawans, including workers, women, students, and children. They held aloft huge banners reading "Oppose US Occupation of Okinawa" and "Defend Life," waved Japanese flags, and shouted slogans as they marched in the rain. On the streets, people eagerly read leaflets from the Japan Socialist Party. The leaflet was titled: "We Cannot Ignore Our Compatriots in Okinawa." The leaflet called on the Japanese people to unite to prevent the United States from turning Okinawa into a base for atomic and hydrogen bombs.

At 11:00 AM, the Japanese flag and a green flag symbolizing the defense of their beloved land were raised on the tall flagpole in the park square. The "National Rally Against the Occupation of Okinawa Land" began. Representatives sent by the Okinawan people: Sekichiyo Asato (Chairman of the Socialist Masses Party), Zenpuku Shinzato (Secretary-General of the Democratic Party), and Jojyo Onaga (Mayor of Shuri) walked onto the stage amidst applause. They denounced to the assembly the shameless act of the United States in permanently occupying Okinawa. They conveyed the Okinawan people's strong will for peace and the defense of life. Asato said: The Okinawan people are now under the rule of a foreign race. They have suffered the tragedy of war and must never live alongside atomic weapons. He believed that with the support of more than 80 million Japanese people, the resistance movement would surely be victorious! Finally, the assembly unanimously passed a resolution. The resolution stated: In order to protect the interests of the residents of Okinawa Island, we, in the name of the assembly, demand that the Japanese government actively protest to the US government, and that a national movement be launched regardless of party affiliation to denounce the crimes of the United States to the people of the world.

After the meeting, the impassioned crowd poured into the streets, and angry roars were constantly heard from the propaganda trucks.

At the same time, Osaka cinemas screened recent newsreels of the Okinawan people opposing military bases. From the screen, people could see the American flag flying over the beautiful island of Okinawa, and atomic cannons roaring. Meanwhile, the Okinawan people lived in poverty and humiliation.

According to the representatives from Okinawa Island: The United States has seized a quarter of Okinawa's land, making it impossible for the islanders to live. In villages such as Chatan Village north of Naha City, 90 percent of the land has been occupied by the US military, forcing 10,000 farmers to live on a small piece of land that is only one-tenth the size of what they owned before. One family of nine had 2,800 tsubo of farmland, all of which was occupied by the US military. Last year, the land compensation they received from the US military amounted to 18,000 yen, which was only enough for one month's minimum living expenses.

Representative Asato said: The Okinawan people have not only lost their land, but also lost their morality and the qualities of the Okinawan people due to the influence of the American way of life. Around the US military bases, tens of thousands of women have become prostitutes. Young people watch American soldiers playing with women all day long, and they all learn to do bad things. Last year, the most criminals were 22-year-olds.

The Okinawan people have endured more than ten years of suffering and can no longer bear it. Even children oppose the thieving behavior of the United States. Recently, a primary school student in Naha City wrote in a composition: "The United States says it will build good schools for us, but we must first take back our land." When the United States recently declared that it would permanently occupy Okinawa, all 800,000 people on the island were extremely indignant.

From the newsreel, people could see the scene of the Okinawa National Convention on June 20. On this day, about 400,000 people held protests in Naha City and other places. Slogans such as "Oppose American Robbers," "Defend the Land," and "Defend Life" covered the sky, and men, women, old, and young were all filled with uncontrollable anger. After the meeting, the extremely indignant crowd staged a demonstration in front of the US military institutions.

The cries of protest have linked Okinawa and Japan together. On July 4, a "National Convention" against the US military's requisition of Okinawa land will be held in Tokyo.

    抗议呼声从冲绳到日本连成一片
    大阪举行反对美国强占冲绳大会
    本报记者裴达东京二日电　七月一日，大阪市响起了愤怒的歌声：
      “下海，捕不到鱼
      上山，打不着柴
      啊！冲绳的海和山
      原子大炮在轰鸣
      忍受了十年的冲绳呀
      今天要站起来
      ……极端横暴的美国呀
      看看我们的力量”
    这天一清早，大阪、兵库和歌山、奈良等各府县上万的人们，从四面八方向大阪中之岛公园涌进。人群中有很多冲绳人，其中有工人、妇女、学生和儿童。他们高举着“反对美国强占冲绳”、“保卫生命”等巨幅标语，挥着日本国旗，高呼着口号冒雨前进。大街上，人们激奋地阅读日本社会党的传单。传单的题目是：“不能对冲绳的同胞置之不理”。传单号召日本人民团结起来，防止美国把冲绳变成原子弹和氢弹基地。
    十一时，公园广场高高的旗杆上，升起日本国旗和象征着保卫可爱土地的绿色旗帜。“反对强占冲绳土地国民大会”开始了。冲绳人民派来的代表：安里积千代（社会大众党委员长）、新里善福（民主党干事长）、翁长助静（真和志市长）在全场掌声中走上主席台。他们向大会控诉了美国要永久强占冲绳的无耻行为。他们传达了冲绳人民要求和平、保卫生命的坚强意志。安里说：冲绳人民现今处在异民族的支配之下。他们遭受过战争惨祸，他们绝不能和原子武器共居。他相信有八千多万日本人民的支持，反抗运动一定能取得胜利！最后，大会一致通过了一项决议。决议中说：为了保护冲绳岛居民的利益，我们以大会的名义要求日本政府积极地向美国政府提出抗议，而且要不分党派地展开国民运动，向全世界人民控诉美国的罪行。
    会后，激愤的人群涌向大街，从宣传队的卡车里，不断传出愤怒的吼声。
    与此同时，大阪电影院放映了最近冲绳岛人民反对军事基地的新闻纪录片。从银幕上人们可以看到，在美丽的冲绳岛上飘扬着美国的国旗，原子大炮在轰鸣。而冲绳人民则生活在贫困和屈辱之中。
    据冲绳岛的代表们谈：美国在冲绳强占了四分之一的土地，迫使岛民无法生活。如那霸市北边的北谷村等村庄，有百分之九十的土地被美军占用，迫使一万农民生活在十分之一的小块土地上。有一个九口之家，原有两千八百坪的田地，全部被美军占用。去年他们从美军领得的土地代金，合日元一万八千元，只够一个月的最低生活费用。
    安里代表说：冲绳人民不仅丧失土地，而且由于美国生活方式的影响，连道义和冲绳人的品质都失掉了。在美军基地周围，数万妇女变成了私娼。年轻人整天看着美国大兵玩弄女性，也都学坏了。去年犯罪最多的是二十二岁的青年。
    冲绳人民经受十多年的苦难，不能再忍受下去了，连小孩子都反对美国的强盗行为。最近那霸市一个小学生的作文里写道：“美国说要给我们修建好的学校，可是我们先要收回土地。”当美国最近声言要永久占用冲绳的时候，全岛八十万人民无不万分愤慨。
    从新闻纪录片上，人们可以看到六月二十日冲绳全民大会的情形。这一天，约有四十万人在那霸市等地举行抗议大会。“反对美国强盗”“保卫土地”“保卫生命”等标语牌遮天盖地，男女老少一个个怒不可止。会后，万分激愤的人群在美国军事机关门前，进行示威游行。
    抗议的呼声从冲绳到日本已连成一片。七月四日，反对美军征用冲绳土地“国民大会”即将在东京举行。
