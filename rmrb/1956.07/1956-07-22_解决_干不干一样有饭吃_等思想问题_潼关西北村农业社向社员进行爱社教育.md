Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 20th - The Northwest Village Agricultural Production Cooperative in Tongguan County, Shaanxi Province, used methods of calculating comparative income accounts, increased production accounts, and loss accounts during the summer harvest distribution summary to conduct love-the-cooperative education for its members, solving problems that existed in the newly established cooperative.

The Northwest Village Agricultural Cooperative was established this spring. After its establishment, many problems existed in the thinking and production of the cooperative members. Some members doubted whether the agricultural cooperative could increase production and whether they would receive a larger share if production increased. Some members believed that after joining the advanced cooperative, all property was "handed over to the public," and whether they worked or not, they would still get fed. Therefore, these people were not active enough in production. Many members also only sought to earn more work points in labor, disregarding quality, which caused significant losses to production.

In response to these problems, the Northwest Village Advanced Cooperative Branch of the Chinese Communist Party seized the opportunity of this year's summer harvest distribution to conduct education for all members on the superiority of agricultural cooperation and love for the cooperative. First, they mobilized the members to calculate the cooperative's increased production account for the summer crops this year. This year, the average yield per mu of summer crops in this cooperative was 163 jin, 29% higher than last year and much higher than the yields of local elementary cooperatives and individual farmers. When discussing the reasons for increased production, everyone believed that collective production provided the conditions to improve farming techniques. In the past, the management of wheat fields here was extremely rough. After the cooperative was established this spring, all the wheat fields in the cooperative were weeded twice, finely hoed once, and harrowed once, and 80% of the wheat fields were top-dressed with more than 3,000 jin of fertilizer per mu. At the same time, the cooperative also built new farmland water conservancy projects this spring, which ensured a good harvest for the summer crops. After calculating this account, the members specifically recognized the superiority of the advanced cooperative.

On the basis of calculating the cooperative's increased production account, the branch then guided the members to calculate the income comparison account before and after joining the cooperative. Before the settlement and distribution, the cooperative repeatedly reviewed the pre-distribution plan according to the principle of "deducting less and distributing more," reducing more than 2,000 yuan of unnecessary and non-urgent production investments and non-production deductions, so that members' income increased from 62% to 65% of the cooperative's total income. For members with fewer workdays, such as the orphaned, widowed, elderly, weak, disabled, and family members of revolutionary soldiers, as well as cooperative cadres with more missed workdays, appropriate arrangements were made through democratic evaluation and by using subsidies and public welfare funds and preferential care funds. As a result, 90.84% of the 240 households in the cooperative had increased income compared to last year. After the distribution, the members carefully calculated their personal income, and everyone clearly recognized that the income of those who actively worked had increased. Members whose income decreased, after everyone's help and analysis in the accounting process, realized that their failure to actively participate in cooperative labor was the main reason for the decrease in income.

Next, the branch had the members calculate the loss account in production since the establishment of the cooperative. For example, some members, in order to earn more work points, were greedy for quantity and speed in their work, resulting in more grain loss during wheat harvesting and threshing. Calculating an average of six jin lost per mu, the cooperative's more than 1,800 mu of wheat fields lost about 11,000 jin of wheat. Due to wide row spacing and missing seedlings, the more than 300 mu of corn planted lost about 26,000 jin of corn. The number of losses from these two items alone was quite considerable. After such a detailed calculation, the members were greatly shocked. After calculating these three accounts, many doubts and problems in the members' thinking were resolved, collective consciousness was strengthened, and their work attitude was greatly changed. At this time, the branch timely proposed the "four guarantees" slogan: guaranteeing cotton boll protection, guaranteeing autumn field seedling protection, guaranteeing the completion of manure accumulation tasks, and guaranteeing the good plowing of fallow land, directing the members' labor enthusiasm towards strengthening current production work to make up for the losses.

### 解决“干不干一样有饭吃”等思想问题  潼关西北村农业社向社员进行爱社教育

    解决“干不干一样有饭吃”等思想问题
    潼关西北村农业社向社员进行爱社教育
    新华社西安20日电　陕西省潼关县西北村农业生产合作社，在夏收分配总结中用算收入对比账、增产账、损失账的方法向社员进行爱社教育，解决了新建社中存在的问题。
    西北村农业社是今春建成的，建社后社员思想和生产上存在不少问题。有些社员怀疑农业社是否能够增产，增产了自己是否能多分。有些社员认为，加入高级社财产都“交了公”，干不干一样有饭吃。因此这些人在生产中不够积极。还有不少社员在劳动中只图多挣工分，不顾质量，给生产带来不小损失。
    根据这些问题，中共西北村高级社支部便抓紧今年夏收分配的时机，向全体社员进行关于农业合作化的优越性和爱社的教育。首先发动社员算了全社今年夏田的增产账。今年这个社的夏田平均亩产一百六十三斤，比去年高出29％，比当地初级社和单干农民的产量高出更多。大家讨论增产原因时，都认为进行集体生产，有条件改进耕作技术。过去，这里对麦田管理极其粗糙。今春建社后，全社麦田普遍拔了两次草、细锄了一次，耙了一遍，并且有80％的麦田每亩上了三千多斤追肥。同时，这个社今春还新修了农田水利，因而保证了夏田获得丰收。算了这一笔账，社员们具体地认清了高级社的优越性。
    在算全社增产账的基础上，支部接着又引导社员算了入社前后的收入对比账。这个社在结算分配前，根据“少扣多分”的原则，曾反复审核了预分方案，削减了二千多元的不必要和不急需的生产投资及非生产扣除，使社员收入从占全社总收入的62％提高到65％。对孤寡老弱残疾和革命军人家属等劳动日少的社员以及误工多的社干部，通过民主评议，采取补助和用公益金、优抚费等贴补办法，做了妥善安排。因此，全社二百四十户社员中有90.84％比去年增加了收入。分配之后，社员们仔细计算了个人收入的情况，大家清楚地认识到：凡是积极劳动的收入都增加了。减少收入的社员在算账中经过大家帮助分析，认识到自己未积极参加社内劳动是收入减少的主要原因。
    接着支部又让社员算了建社以来生产中损失账，例如有些社员为了多挣工分，活干贪多图快，麦收脱粒较多，平均以六斤计算，全社一千八百多亩麦田约少收一万一千斤小麦。播种的三百多亩玉米，由于行距宽、缺苗多，约少收二万六千斤玉米。只这两项损失数目就相当可观。这样细细一算，社员们大吃一惊。算了这三笔账以后，社员思想中的许多疑虑和问题解决了，加强了集体观念，劳动态度也大大改变。这时，分支部及时提出：棉花保桃、秋田保苗、积肥任务保完成、休闲地保翻好的“四保”号召，把社员的劳动热情引向加强当前生产的工作，以弥补损失。
