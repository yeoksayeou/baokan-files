To Better Meet Production and Living Needs
Fujian Increases Construction of New Industrial and Mining Enterprises

Fuzhou, July 20th (reporter from this newspaper) – The Fujian Provincial People's Committee recently decided to add seventy-four new projects to the 154 industrial capital construction projects planned for new construction and expansion in the province in the second half of this year.

Most of these new projects belong to light industry, including small machine factories, hydroelectric power plants, lime factories, brick and tile factories, and sulfur, graphite, coal, and other industrial and mining enterprises serving industrial and agricultural production and construction. In addition, there are manufacturing industries that meet the needs of people's lives, such as candy, biscuits, canned food, enamelware, paint, furniture, and cultural goods. These industries are characterized by small investments, easy construction, significant benefits, and suitability to Fujian Province's production, supply, and sales needs. After completion, they can further utilize the rich resources of the province to produce more products to meet the growing production and living needs of the local people.

Among the seventy-four newly added projects, some factories, once completed, can manufacture new products that Fujian Province has never produced before. For example, the Fuzhou Glass Factory could only manufacture bamboo-cased thermos bottles. Once the iron-casing workshop of this factory is completed, it can produce iron-cased thermos bottles in large quantities.

The sites for most of these newly built and renovated industrial and mining enterprises have already been determined. Except for the renovation projects of the Zhangzhou Winery and the Zhangzhou Pottery Factory, which have already started construction, most projects will begin design in late July and early August, successively begin construction in September and October, and strive to put them into production by the end of this year.

    更好地满足生产和生活方面的需要
    福建增建新的工矿企业
    本报福州20日电　福建省人民委员会最近决定，在全省今年下半年计划新建扩建的154个工业基本建设项目以外，再增加七十四个新项目。
    这些新的项目大部分属于轻工业，其中有为工农业生产建设服务的小型机器厂、水电厂、石灰厂、砖瓦厂和硫磺、石墨、煤炭等工矿，此外，还有满足人民生活需要的糖果、饼干、罐头食品、搪瓷器具、油漆、家俱、文化用品等制造工业。这些工业的特点是投资小，建设容易，收效较大，并适合福建省产供销需要；建成以后能进一步运用全省各地丰富的资源，生产更多的产品以满足当地人民日益增长的生产和生活方面的需要。
    在新增加的七十四个项目中，有些工厂建成后，可以制造福建省从未生产过的新产品。如福州玻璃厂原来只能制造竹壳热水瓶，这个厂的铁壳车间建成后，就可以大量生产铁壳热水瓶。
    这些新建、改建工矿的场地大部分已经决定，除漳州酒厂和漳州陶器厂的改建工程已经动工外，大部分工程将在七月底八月初开始设计，九、十月份陆续施工，并争取今年年底投入生产。
