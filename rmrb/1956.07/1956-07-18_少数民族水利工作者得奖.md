Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: Yunnan Province's thirty-five advanced water conservancy workers from ten minority nationalities, including Dai, Yi, and Bai, were rewarded by the Provincial People's Committee at the closing ceremony of the provincial water conservancy work conference on the 14th.

　　The recipients of these awards are mostly technical innovators. Yue Han, a Dai water conservancy committee member from Hesai Township, Ruili County, Dehong Dai and Jingpo Autonomous Prefecture, created a method of using bamboo stakes and bamboo shoots to block water dams, which strengthened the Zhedong River dam that was frequently threatened by floods over the years, saving approximately 400 laborers each year. He also adopted the method of setting up water distribution outlets according to acreage along the ditches for rational water use, solving disputes caused by water competition in the past. Pu Junchang, the Yi deputy director of the Hewai Township agricultural cooperative in Eshan County, successfully led cooperative members in trial-producing a cow-drawn water pump, each of which can save ten laborers and is more efficient than the old-fashioned waterwheel. The entire county is now preparing to promote its use. In addition, more than one hundred Han farmers and units were also rewarded at the meeting.

    少数民族水利工作者得奖
    据新华社讯　云南省三十五个傣、彝、民家等十种少数民族的先进水利工作者十四日在全省水利工作会议闭幕式上得到了省人民委员会的奖励。
    这次获得奖励的，大都是技术革新者。德宏傣族景颇族自治州瑞丽县合晒乡的傣族水利委员岳喊，创造了用竹桩竹稍堵水坝的办法，使历年来经常受洪水威胁的遮东河堤坝加固，每年可以节省约四百个劳动力。他还采取了在沟边按田亩设立分水口的办法合理用水，解决了往年因争水而引起的纠纷。峨山县河外乡农业社的彝族副主任普俊昌，带领社员试制牛拉抽水机成功，每部抽水机可节约十个人工，比旧式水车的效率也高得多，现在全县正准备推广使用。此外，还有一百多个汉族农民和单位也在会上受到了奖励。
