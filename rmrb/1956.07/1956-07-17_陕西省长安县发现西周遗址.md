Xinhua News Agency Report: A relatively large Western Zhou Dynasty site was recently excavated by staff from the Xi'an Research Office of the Institute of Archaeology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Fengxi Township, Chang'an County, Shaanxi Province.

　　This site is approximately three thousand years old. Among the 1,300 square meters of the site that have already been excavated, there are round and rectangular house ruins, pottery kiln sites, and rectangular wells. In the house ruins, there are stoves and water vats. Additionally, bronze arrowheads, stone knives, bone arrowheads, animal bones and tortoise shells used for divination, and some exquisitely crafted bone hairpins, jade ornaments, and other decorations were unearthed. These relics and sites reflect the production and living conditions of the people at that time and are helpful for the study of Western Zhou society and culture. Forty-two Western Zhou Dynasty tombs were also discovered at the site. Burial methods such as prone burials and waist pits are very similar to the burial customs of the Yin Dynasty.

　　According to ancient literature, the capital cities of the Western Zhou Dynasty, Fengjing and Haojing, were located on the west and east banks of the Li River in Chang'an County, Shaanxi Province. After many investigations, archaeologists have confirmed that there are a considerable number of Western Zhou Dynasty remains in an area about twenty li long in the vicinity of Pudu Village on the east bank of the Li River and Qindu Town on the west bank.

    陕西省长安县发现西周遗址
    据新华社讯　一处规模比较大的西周遗址，最近被中国科学院考古研究所西安研究室的工作人员在陕西省长安县丰西乡发掘出来。
    这处遗址距现在大约有三千年。在已经发掘的一千三百平方公尺的遗址中，有圆形和长方形的房屋遗址、烧制陶器的窑址和长方形的水井。在房屋遗址中有炉灶和水缸。另外出土的还有铜镞、石刀、骨镞、占卜用的兽骨、龟甲和一些制作很精致的骨簪、佩玉等装饰品。这些遗物和遗址反映出当时人们生产和生活的情况，有助于对西周社会和文化的研究。在遗址中同时发现的还有西周时期的墓葬四十二个，其中的俯身葬、腰坑等葬法和殷代的埋葬习俗很相近。
    据古代文献记载，西周的京城——丰京和镐京便在陕西省长安县澧河的西岸和东岸。考古工作者经过多次调查，证实澧河东岸的普渡村和西岸的秦渡镇一带长约二十多里的地方有相当多的西周遗存。
