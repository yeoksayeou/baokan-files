Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 20th: Late news from Pingshun County: From 2:00 PM to 4:00 PM on July 14th, Xigou, Chuandi, and five other townships in Pingshun County suffered severe hailstorms. The hailstones were as large as eggs and as small as apricot kernels, with ice accumulating on the ground to a depth of five to eight inches. The hardest hit areas were the Jinxing Agricultural, Forestry, and Animal Husbandry Production Cooperative led by Li Shunda, and the May First Agricultural Production Cooperative led by Guo Yu'en. Of the Jinxing Cooperative's 1,684 mu of autumn crops, 1,426 mu were affected, accounting for 84%, of which 530 mu suffered a 60% reduction in yield, 159 mu a 70% reduction, and 669 mu an 80% reduction. All 1,258 mu of autumn crops in the May First Cooperative were affected. Three hundred and ten mu have basically no harvest and need to be replanted entirely. In addition, this cooperative's millet yield was reduced by half, and most of the melons, beans, and oil crops were destroyed.

After the disaster, the Changzhi Local Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Pingshun County Committee immediately sent people to the five townships to express their condolences and to help the above townships summarize their experiences in combating the disaster in 1952, encouraging members of the agricultural cooperatives to have the confidence to overcome the disaster. The Pingshun County Grain Bureau allocated more than 3,000 jin of barley and radish seeds to the affected cooperatives for replanting and reseeding.

On the 15th and 16th, all members of the Jinxing Cooperative went to the fields to support seedlings and prune leaves to salvage the crops; those that could not be salvaged have been replanted with late-autumn crops. The Jinxing Cooperative also decided to increase the application of fertilizer to strive for a better harvest from the salvageable autumn crops. Due to the severity of the disaster, the original plan to increase production can no longer be achieved. The Jinxing Cooperative has decided to develop seven new sideline productions to partially compensate for the agricultural cooperative's losses in agriculture.

Currently, with the support of the Party and the government, the affected cooperatives are stepping up replanting and reseeding, which is expected to be completed within a week.

    平顺县西沟、川底等乡遭受严重雹灾
    现正积极挽救田禾改种晚秋作物
    新华社太原20日电　平顺县迟到消息：七月十四日下午二时到四时，平顺县西沟、川底等五个乡遭受了严重雹灾。冰雹大如鸡蛋，小如杏核，地面积冰五寸到八寸。受灾最重的是李顺达领导的金星农林牧生产合作社和郭玉恩领导的五一农业生产合作社。金星社的1，684亩秋作物中，有1，426亩受灾，占84％，其中减产六成的530亩，减七成的159亩，减八成的669亩。五一社的1，258亩秋作物全部受灾。其中三百一十亩基本上没有收成了，需要全部改种。此外这个社的谷子减产一半，瓜、豆油料大部打光。
    受灾后，中共长治地方委员会和平顺县委员会立即派人前往五个乡进行慰问，并帮助上述各乡总结了1952年抗灾斗争经验，鼓舞各农业社社员战胜灾害的信心。平顺县粮食局拨出三千多斤大麦和萝卜种籽给受灾各社作补种和改种用。
    十五日和十六日，金星社社员全部下地扶苗剪叶，挽救田禾；无法挽救的已改种晚秋作物。金星社并且决定用增加追肥的办法来争取可挽救的秋禾多收。由于受灾过重，原订增产计划已无法完成。金星社决定开展七种新的副业生产，部分弥补农业社在农业方面的损失。
    现在，受灾各社都在党和政府的支援下加紧补种和改种，预计一周内就可完成。
