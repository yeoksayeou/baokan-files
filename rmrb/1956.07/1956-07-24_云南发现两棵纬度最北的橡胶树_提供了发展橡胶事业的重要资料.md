    Yunnan Discovers Two Rubber Trees at the Northernmost Latitude
    Provides Important Data for Developing the Rubber Industry
    Xinhua News Agency News The success of tapping rubber from two rubber trees growing on Phoenix Mountain in Yingjiang County, Dehong Dai and Jingpo Autonomous Prefecture, Yunnan Province, proves that planting rubber trees locally yields a high amount of rubber.
    These two rubber trees are the Hevea brasiliensis species and grow at 24 degrees 46 minutes north latitude. This is a fairly high latitude for planting rubber. These two rubber trees were introduced from abroad by an elderly Dai man fifty years ago. They are now sixteen or seventeen meters tall and thirty to sixty-plus centimeters in diameter. These two trees had not been tapped for rubber in the past. In recent years, trial tapping has been carried out. The trunk of the larger tree has completely dried out, so rubber can only be tapped from the branches. The annual output is up to more than nine kilograms (dry rubber). One-half of the trunk of the other rubber tree has also dried out, so rubber can only be tapped from the upper half. The annual output is still more than three kilograms (dry rubber). The rubber yield is not low.
    The Yunnan Provincial Tropical Crops Bureau's observation of these two rubber trees has provided important data for developing the rubber industry in Yunnan, confirming that it is possible to develop rubber plantation there. The Yunnan Provincial Tropical Crops Bureau is still conducting further research.

    云南发现两棵纬度最北的橡胶树
    提供了发展橡胶事业的重要资料
    新华社讯　生长在云南省德宏傣族景颇族自治州盈江县凤凰山上的两棵橡胶树割胶的成绩证明，当地种植橡胶树，产胶量也很高。
    这两棵橡胶树是三叶橡胶，生长的地方是北纬二十四度四十六分。就种植橡胶说，这个纬度算相当高了。这两棵橡胶树是五十年前由一位傣族老人从国外引进的，现在已有十六七公尺高，直径三十到六十多公分。这两棵树过去没有割过胶，近年试验割胶，大的一棵主干已经全部干枯，只能从支干上割胶，年产量最高达到九公斤多（干胶）。另一棵橡胶主干已有二分之一干枯，也只能从上半部割胶，年产量仍有三公斤多（干胶）。产胶量不算低。
    云南省热带作物局对这两株橡胶树观察的结果，已为云南发展橡胶事业提供了重要资料，肯定当地可以发展胶园种植事业。现在云南省热带作物局还在进一步作研究。
