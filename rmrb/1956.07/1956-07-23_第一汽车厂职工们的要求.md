Demands of the First Automobile Works Employees

The Party, government, labor union, and Communist Youth League leaders of the First Automobile Works do not care about the lives and welfare of the employees. For three years, the employees of this factory have not had a single health check. According to incomplete statistics, there are nearly 700 tuberculosis patients now, and because they are scattered in various canteens for meals, the disease is constantly spreading. Sanitary facilities are lacking in the factory, but last year over 80,000 yuan was "saved" from the employee health budget. In the first quarter, the employee morbidity rate accounted for 22.33% of the total number of employees, and the consultation rate was as high as 96.91%.

More than 2,000 employee households in this factory live far away from the factory, some even forty *li* away, and they have to change buses four times a day to get to work, which takes two hours each way. Song Yu, a worker in the forging workshop, has a large family and a heavy financial burden, and cannot afford to take the bus, so he has to get up at four o'clock every morning to walk to the factory. The factory stipulates that everyone, regardless of salary, must pay three yuan per month for transportation expenses. Some workers pay 10% of their salary for transportation. Workers in the power system work in three shifts day and night, but there is no transportation after 10 p.m. Workers who live far from the factory have to arrive at the factory as early as 9 p.m. because they have to go to work at 1 a.m.

The allocation of housing in this factory is unreasonable, and the rent is too high. Some families of six live in one room and have to sleep on the floor at night and roll up their bedding during the day. The factory canteen also has many shortcomings in management and is very crowded. The workers' only one-hour lunch break is often taken up by waiting in line for food.

The reason why these problems have not been solved for a long time is mainly because there is a serious bureaucratic style of work among the leaders of the automobile factory. Some problems they simply do not know about, and although they know a little about some problems, they do not understand the seriousness of the problems, and therefore adopt a delaying and perfunctory attitude.

This style of the automobile factory leaders, who do not go deep among the masses and do not care about the hardships of the employees, has created a very bad influence among the employees and has also harmed the enthusiasm of the employees. It is hoped that the leaders of the automobile factory will quickly overcome this shortcoming. Liu Chunshu

    第一汽车厂职工们的要求
    第一汽车制造厂的党政工团领导人员不关心职工的生活福利。这个厂的职工，三年来没有进行过一次健康检查。据不完全统计，现在肺病患者近七百人，因为他们散布在各个食堂吃饭，所以肺病还在不断传染。厂内卫生设施缺乏，去年职工卫生费用却“节约”了八万多元。第一季度，职工的发病率占总人数的22.33％，求诊率竟高达96.91％。
    这个厂有两千多户职工住在离厂很远的地方，有的甚至有四十里路远，每天上班要换四次车，走一趟就需要两小时。锻工车间宋玉和家里人口多，生活负担重，坐不起车，每天早上四点钟就得起床往工厂走。厂里规定不论工资高低，每人一个月要负担车费三元。有的工人付出的车费占工资的10％。动力系统的工人日夜三班轮换工作，但是晚上十点钟以后就没有交通工具，住得离厂远的工人因为要在夜间一点钟上班，不得不提早在晚上九点钟就到工厂来。
    这个厂房子分配得不合理，而且房租太高。有的是六口人住一间房子，不得不晚上睡地板，白天卷铺盖。这个厂的食堂在管理方面也有很多缺点，而且非常拥挤，工人们中午仅有的一小时休息时间，常被排队吃饭占光了。
    这些问题所以长期不能解决，主要是因为汽车厂领导方面存在着严重的官僚主义作风，有的问题他们根本不知道，有的问题虽然知道一点，却不了解问题的严重性，以致采取推拖敷衍的态度。
    汽车厂领导人员这种不深入群众、不关心职工疾苦的作风，在职工群众中造成了很不好的影响，也伤害了职工的积极性。希望汽车厂领导方面迅速克服这个缺点。　刘春舒
