    The jointly owned public-private Xinda Xiang Silk, Woolen Fabric, and Cotton Cloth Store, which moved from Shanghai, opened in Lanzhou's most bustling Nanguan on July 10th. This is the first of a batch of stores moving from Shanghai to Lanzhou to begin business. The store's staff are proud to be serving this emerging industrial city for the first time, and they warmly welcome every customer.

    Although it was a Tuesday, the store was packed with customers, with five to six thousand people coming to buy things and browse on the first day. The turnover reached 21,680 yuan, equivalent to more than three times the store's daily turnover in Shanghai. As soon as the doors opened at ten o'clock in the morning, customers poured into the store one after another, selecting their favorite clothing materials and ordering fashionable new styles. In that long row of silk and satin display windows, there were more than 400 kinds of silk and satin, including the famous brocades produced in Shanghai and Hangzhou, the imperial concubine-colored Tianxiang silk produced in Tianjin, and various inexpensive and beautiful printed soft satins. People could freely choose the one they liked. The cotton cloth department had 1,500 kinds of various printed cloths, floral linen, seersucker, poplin, etc., most of which were newly designed and produced by large printing and dyeing factories in Shanghai. The complete range of colors and patterns of goods has been warmly welcomed by the masses. But what customers are even more satisfied with is their enthusiastic service attitude and skilled business techniques. For example, a demobilized soldier wanted to buy 3.2 yards of navy blue cloth to make two Zhongshan suits. The salesperson measured his figure and felt that he was buying too much, telling him that he only needed three yards. This demobilized soldier used to use 1.6 yards of cloth for one suit. But this time at Xinda Xiang, he ordered two suits with only three yards of cloth. In addition to carefully calculating for consumers, this store also makes people feel convenient everywhere. As soon as you choose the clothing material, you can have the salesperson complete the payment procedures without leaving the counter, and you can leave the store with your favorite clothing material. In addition, they are skilled in their business, measuring quickly, cutting quickly, and calculating quickly, so they take up very little of the customer's time. Customers are very satisfied.

    Xinda Xiang is one of the three famous cotton cloth stores in Shanghai, with more than 20 years of business history, and has won the praise of the masses for its complete range of colors and patterns and its good service attitude. This time, in order to support the emerging industrial and mining cities and serve socialist construction, the store's staff decided to respond to the government's call to move the company from Shanghai to Lanzhou. Their actions have been strongly supported by relevant departments in Shanghai and Lanzhou. Shanghai Textile, Silk, and Department Store companies have replenished them with a large amount of silk, woolen fabrics, and cotton cloth, and fully meet their requirements for varieties to maintain the original characteristics of the store. The Lanzhou Municipal Commercial Department vacated a building on the most prosperous street in the city center for them to use as a sales department. The dormitories for the staff's families have also been properly resolved. All of these have encouraged the workers' enthusiasm for labor.

    在兰州开业的第一天
    燕树桂
    从上海迁来的公私合营信大祥绸缎呢绒棉布店，七月十日在兰州最繁华的南关开业了。这是上海迁往兰州市的一批商店中最先开始营业的一个商店。商店的工作人员以自己能够首次为这个新兴的工业城市服务而感到自豪，他们热情的接待每个顾客。
    这天是星期二，但仍然顾客盈门，第一天前来买东西和参观的有五、六万人。营业额达到二万一千六百八十元，相当于这个商店在上海一天营业额的三倍多。上午十点门刚打开，顾客们便陆续不断地涌进商店，选购自己最满意的衣料和定作式样新颖的时装。在那一长列的绸缎橱窗里，陈列着四百多种绸缎，其中有上海、杭州出产的著名的织锦缎，有天津出产的妃色天香绢，还有价廉而又美观的各种印花软缎。人们可以自由地选择自己所喜爱的一种。棉布部各种各样的印花布、花麻纱、泡泡纱、府绸等，共有一千五百种，其中绝大部分都是上海一些大的印染厂新近设计生产出来的。商品的花色齐全已经受到群众的热烈欢迎。但顾客更满意的是他们那种热心为群众的服务态度和熟练的业务技术。比如有一个复员军人要买三丈二尺毛蓝布，作两套中山装，营业员把他的身材量了一下，觉得买的太多，告诉他只要买三丈就可以了。这个复员军人往常作一套衣服，都要用布一丈六。但这次在信大祥只用三丈布就订作了二套衣服。这个商店除了为消费者精打细算外，还处处让群众感到方便。你只要把衣料选好，不用离开柜台，一会儿便可由营业员办好交款手续，你就可以带着你心爱的衣料离开商店。再加上他们业务熟练，量的快、剪的快、算的快，所以占用顾客的时间就很短。顾客们都很满意。
    信大祥是上海著名的棉布店三大祥之一，已有二十多年的经营历史，以花色品种齐全、服务态度良好而获得群众的好评。这次，商店工作人员为了支援新兴工矿城市，为社会主义建设服务，决定响应政府号召，把企业从上海搬到兰州来。他们这一行动得到上海、兰州有关部门的大力支持。上海纺织品、丝绸、百货等公司给他们补充了大量的绸缎呢绒和棉布，并且充分满足他们对品种的要求，以保持商店原有的特点。兰州市商业部门为他们在市中心最繁华的街道上让出一座楼房，作为门市部。对职工家属的宿舍也作了妥善解决。这些都鼓舞了职工们的劳动热情。
