Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, July 9th: The Longri State-Owned Farm on the northwestern plateau of Sichuan Province is undertaking a large-scale project to transform swamp land.

    In the area of Anquba and Halama, which stretches over one hundred li in the northern part of the farm, the workers have been working intensely for over a month. They plan to turn over 60,000 mu of swamp land into arable land by building drainage projects. Because the Bai River flows through this area, they also need to build more than two kilometers of flood control dikes and straighten the six-kilometer-long winding river channel into two kilometers to prevent river water from flooding the grasslands. Currently, they have built nine drainage canals and are starting to construct flood control dikes and channel realignment projects.

    Last year, the Longri Farm conducted its first experiment in transforming swamp land on the grasslands, digging thirteen drainage ditches totaling eighteen kilometers in length. As a result, many areas that were previously knee-deep in stagnant water became dry land, and places where people and horses could not pass became passable.

    According to preliminary surveys, there are tens of millions of mu of wasteland that can be reclaimed on the entire grassland, but about 30% of it is swamp land. The Longri Farm is the first unit to carry out this type of transformation work.

### 大片沼泽地将要变成良田

    大片沼泽地将要变成良田
    新华社成都9日电　四川省西北高原上的地方国营龙日农场，正在进行较大规模的改造沼泽地工作。
    在农场北部的安曲坝和哈拉玛等一百多里长的地带上，职工们已经紧张地劳动了一个多月。他们计划通过修建排水工程，把这里六万多亩沼泽地变为耕地。由于白河流经这里，他们还要修两公里多长的防洪堤，和把六公里的弯曲河道拉直成两公里，防止河水浸入草地。目前，他们已修筑了九条排水渠，并正着手修建防洪堤和改道工程。
    龙日农场去年在草地上第一次进行了改造沼泽地的试验，挖了共长十八公里的十三条水渠进行排水，结果使许多过去淤水及膝的地区变成干地，过去人马不能通行的地方可以行走。
    据初步勘查，整个草地上可以开垦的荒地上千万亩，但其中约有30％是沼泽地。龙日农场是进行这种改造工作的第一个单位。
