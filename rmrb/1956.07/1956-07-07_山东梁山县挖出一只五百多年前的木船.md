Xinhua News Agency Report:

    A giant wooden boat, dating back more than 570 years, has recently been unearthed in Liangshan County, Shandong Province, from one meter below the ground.

    This wooden boat is made of Phoebe zhennan wood, and its construction method differs from boats built in the north. The boat is five zhang and one chi in length, one zhang in width, and approximately one person deep. The entire boat has thirteen compartments. Within this boat, which was filled with silt, more than sixty types of items, totaling 214 pieces, were excavated. In the first compartment, there was an iron anchor, with inscriptions on it reading "Made in the 5th year of Hongwu" (i.e., 1372 AD). During the excavation, it was discovered that the bow of the boat was facing north, with the body of the boat slightly inclined to the east.

    The main items excavated from this boat are weapons. Many of the forty iron knives are without any nicks or chips; several of the twenty-three iron helmets are relatively intact, and the shape of the helmets is very similar to the fire helmets worn by modern firefighters. There is a small bronze cannon inside the boat, with inscriptions on it reading "Made in the 10th year of Hongwu," and other characters. Inside the boat, there are also fragments of iron armor, arrowheads, spearheads, and various tools such as saddles, stirrups, iron hoes, iron shovels, as well as saws, chisels, rulers, and pottery jars. Also unearthed from the boat were copper coins engraved with the reign title of Song Zhao Ji (Emperor Huizong), "Daguan Tongbao," and copper coins engraved with the reign title of Ming Zhu Yuanzhang (Emperor Taizu), "Hongwu Tongbao," and others.

    This wooden boat was discovered by members of the Hongguang Agricultural Production Cooperative of Jia Village, Guandi Township, Black Tiger Temple District, Liangshan County, while digging lotus roots in this puddle. During the excavation, it was vaguely discernible that this area was originally a river channel.

    According to preliminary speculation by archaeologists, more than 570 years ago, this wooden boat sailed from the Jiangnan region. It was likely a grain escort ship leading a fleet, and it sank in Jia Village, possibly due to a major storm or after fierce fighting.

    山东梁山县挖出一只五百多年前的木船
    新华社讯　最近在山东省梁山县境内一公尺深的地下，挖掘出一只五百七十多年前的巨大木船。
    这只木船是用楠木作成的，它的修造方法和北方所造的船只不同。船长五丈一尺，宽一丈，约一人深。全船有十三个舱。在这只满沉泥沙的船内，挖出了六十多种共二百一十四件物品。在第一舱中有一铁锚，铁锚上刻有“洪武五年造”（即公元1372年）等铭文。在挖掘时发现船头向北，船身略向东侧倾斜。 
    从这只船内挖掘出来的主要物品是兵器。在四十把铁刀中有很多把毫无缺口；二十三个铁盔还有几个比较完好，帽盔的形状和现今消防队员戴的救火帽很相似。船内有一座小铜炮，铜炮上面刻有“洪武十年造”等字样。船内还有铁甲碎片、箭头、矛头，和各种工具如马鞍、马蹬、铁铣、铁铲以及锯、凿、尺、陶罐等物。从船内挖出的还有刻着有宋赵佶（徽宗）年号的“大观通宝”，刻着明朱元璋（太祖）年号的“洪武通宝”等铜钱。
    这只木船为梁山县黑虎庙区馆里乡贾庄红光农业生产合作社社员在这水洼地里挖藕时发现的。在挖掘的时候，隐约可以看出这一带原来是一条河道。
    据考古学家初步推测，五百七十多年前，这只木船从江南航来，它是走在一支船队前面的护粮船，在贾庄可能是遇到了大风暴或者经过激战之后沉没的。
