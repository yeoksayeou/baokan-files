Xinhua News Agency, Kunming. The Yunnan Flower Lantern Troupe recently performed the adapted Yunnan Flower Lantern opera "Fifteen Strings of Cash" in Kunming. The actors meticulously portrayed the plot and characters of "Fifteen Strings of Cash" in a form that is popular with the masses, and were well received by the audience.

The Flower Lantern opera, which is rich in Yunnan local color, is said to have a history of more than 300 years. According to incomplete statistics, there are more than 140 frequently performed programs. At present, more than 80% of the counties (cities) in Yunnan have amateur Flower Lantern troupes. During the upsurge of cooperativization, almost every agricultural production cooperative had a Flower Lantern singing group. Yuxi County, where the Flower Lantern art form spread earlier, already has more than 60 amateur Flower Lantern troupes.

The Flower Lantern opera "Fifteen Strings of Cash" will also tour the countryside after its performance in Kunming.

    花灯剧团演出“十五贯”
    据新华社昆明讯　云南省花灯剧团最近在昆明公演了改编的云南花灯剧“十五贯”。演员们用群众喜闻乐见的形式细致地表现了剧情，刻划了“十五贯”中的人物，受到观众的欢迎。
    富有云南地方色彩的花灯剧，相传已有三百多年历史，据不完全的统计，经常演出的节目有一百四十多个。现在，云南80％以上的县（市）都有花灯业余剧团，在合作化高潮中，几乎每个农业生产合作社中都有了花灯演唱小组。花灯流传较早的玉溪县已经有六十多个花灯业余剧团。
    花灯“十五贯”在昆明演出后还将到农村巡回演出。
