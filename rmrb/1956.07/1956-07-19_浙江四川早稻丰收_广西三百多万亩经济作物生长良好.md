The average yield of over 3 million mu of early rice is expected to reach 450 jin per mu, an increase of more than 40% compared to last year, resulting in an increase of over 300 million jin of grain. Pingyang County's early rice yield will increase by 60% compared to last year.

The 740,000 mu of early rice along the banks of the Puyang River in Zhejiang Province, which is plagued by floods every year, now boasts full and solid grains. Agricultural cooperative members have begun full-scale harvesting.
