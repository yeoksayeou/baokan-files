Xinhua News Agency, 15th dispatch from Moscow: The Soviet "Chemicals Export Association" Pharmaceutical Sales Department recently received a package returned from California, USA. This was a medicine package it had sent half a year earlier to an American patient named Field in California, containing twenty-four bottles of anti-disseminated sclerosis vaccine. The package was blocked by the relevant U.S. authorities and did not reach the patient.

In connection with the returned medicine package, the Soviet "Chemicals Export Association" Pharmaceutical Sales Department also recently received a letter from Tahoe City, where Field lives. The letter was written by a woman who cares about Field. She wrote in the letter: "Thank you sincerely for sending the package. However, I am distressed that I have not received this medicine for three months. I was called to the customs office, and they showed me the package you sent, but did not give it to me. The box was placed in front of us, but we were not allowed to take it."

"We don't know this Russian medicine" – the customs officers used this sentence as a reason to refuse to release the package.

Field's friends went to the capital of California to petition. However, they were told there that these medicines sent from the Soviet Union seemed to be a new drug and therefore could not be released.

Finally, the health bureau in Washington also refused to hand over the vaccine to Field. The package was detained in Tahoe City for half a year and then returned to Moscow.

The fate of these twenty-four bottles of vaccine in the United States brought unfortunate consequences to Field. A letter received by the Soviet "Chemicals Export Association" stated that Field's condition had seriously deteriorated due to the lack of timely treatment. It is known that the United States does not have this vaccine.

The Soviet anti-disseminated sclerosis vaccine has long been a well-known medicine both domestically and abroad. In the Soviet Union, this medicine has been sold since 1946. Abroad, the Soviet "Chemicals Export Association" Pharmaceutical Sales Department has long been selling these medicines to twenty-six countries. The French Ministry of Health has even established a special department in the "Salpêtrière" Hospital and the Pasteur Institute in Lille to use this vaccine to treat patients.

### 一件原封退回的包裹  苏联医药机构寄去疫苗　美国海关竟然拒绝进口

    一件原封退回的包裹
    苏联医药机构寄去疫苗　美国海关竟然拒绝进口
    新华社15日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联“化学品出口联合会”医药品经销处最近收到了一件从美国加利福尼亚退回的包裹。这是它在半年以前寄给加利福尼亚一个美国病人费尔德的药包，里面装有二十四瓶抗播散性硬化的疫苗。这件包裹遭到了美国的有关当局的阻拦而没有送达病患者。
    和退回的药包有关，苏联“化学品出口联合会”医药品经销处不久以前还收到了一封从费尔德居住的塔洪城寄来的信。这封信是一位关心费尔德的妇女写的。她在信中写道：“衷心感谢你们寄来包裹。可是，我苦恼的是，我已经有三个月得不到这种药了。我被叫到海关机关去，他们给我看了你们寄来的包裹，但是不交给我。匣子放在我们的面前，但是不许我们取它。”
    “我们不晓得这种俄国药品”——海关人员用这句话作为拒绝发给包裹的理由。
    费尔德的朋友们到加利福尼亚州首府去请愿。但是，那里的人对他们说，从苏联寄来的这些药品似乎是一种新药，因此，不能发给。
    最后，华盛顿的卫生局竟也拒绝把疫苗交给费尔德。这个包裹就这样在塔洪城被扣压了半年之后退回莫斯科。
    这二十四瓶疫苗在美国的遭遇给费尔德带来了不幸的后果。苏联“化学品出口联合会”接到的一封信说，由于得不到及时的治疗，费尔德的病已经严重地恶化了。大家知道，美国是没有这种疫苗的。
    苏联的抗播散性硬化疫苗是早就驰名国内外的药品。在苏联，从1946年起就销售这种药品。在国外，苏联“化学品出口联合会”医药品经销处早就向二十六个国家经销这些药品。法国卫生部在“沙尔别特里耶尔”医院和里尔的巴斯德研究所甚至设立专门一个部门，用这种疫苗来治疗病人。
