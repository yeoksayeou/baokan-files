    Improve Design Technology Level
    The National Basic Construction Conference held this year set out preliminary planning goals, requiring all departments to strive to ensure that, in about five years, China's design capabilities can basically independently undertake the design tasks of basic construction in all sectors of the national economy; and to strive to bring China's design work level close to the world's advanced level within the Third Five-Year Plan. This is a major task placed before the leading departments of basic construction and design workers in our country.
    Our country's design work, especially in industrial construction, has made rapid progress and achieved remarkable results in recent years. We have now gathered a surveying and design team of approximately 90,000 people, including more than 42,000 engineering and technical personnel. For the basic construction of the First Five-Year Plan, in addition to the projects designed with the help of the Soviet Union and other People's Democratic countries, many industrial projects and all civil buildings, as well as railway, highway, postal and telecommunications, water conservancy and other construction projects, have been undertaken by our country's design personnel. Through practical work, some industrial departments have also begun to learn the complete set design of certain enterprises, accumulated certain design data and design experience, and a number of outstanding design workers have emerged. However, it should be admitted that our design work level is still very low. It cannot yet meet the needs of the ever-developing basic construction, and we are still unable to independently solve many complex technical problems currently under construction without Soviet experts.
    How can we improve China's design technology level? Gradually establishing professional design institutions and implementing specialization of various professional trades are effective measures to improve design technology level. This is an inevitable trend adapting to the development of industrial technology and the increasing refinement of division of labor. At present, various ministries, according to different process requirements, have begun to adjust the design institutes with complex tasks and excessive personnel into several specialized design institutes. This not only reduces the chaotic phenomenon of design institutes undertaking multiple professional designs, but also improves labor productivity, shortens the completion period, ensures design quality, rapidly masters advanced experience, and better exerts the role of existing design personnel. However, the adjustment work of design specialization has just begun. In the future, it is necessary to carefully consider the cooperative relationship between various professional design institutions after specialization, and prevent disconnection in work.
    In order to rapidly improve design technology level, it is also necessary to strengthen the professional learning of design personnel. Our country's design personnel should accept, learn, and use the existing scientific and technological achievements of the Soviet Union, various People's Democratic countries, and other countries. In order to achieve this task, first, design institutions employing Soviet experts should earnestly learn from Soviet experts, actively apply Soviet advanced experience, and combine it with our country's specific conditions to solve our practical work problems. Second, we must systematically exchange and promote the scientific achievements and advanced experiences in architectural science and technology and design from various countries around the world in a planned way. Third, send experienced design personnel to study abroad; or, in order to solve certain major technical problems and technically complex complete set designs, select senior technical cadres to study abroad, or engage in special technical problem investigation and research
  work. In addition, we must pay special attention to giving play to the enthusiasm and creativity of our country's design personnel, and strive to actively solve problems. Organizing the professional and technical learning of design personnel, establishing a solid professional learning system, and stipulating specific requirements for improving the design personnel within three or five years are also very necessary. For example, inviting Soviet experts or our country's experts and senior engineering and technical personnel to make scientific and technical reports in a planned way, running night universities, opening spare-time technical training classes, allowing young technicians to gain experience in practical work, adopting the method of apprenticeship, designating special personnel to cultivate new forces, and so on. In this way, the technical level of many design personnel will be rapidly improved.
    In the future, designed projects should be undertaken by our country's design institutions as much as possible, or invite the Soviet Union and various People's Democratic countries to send complete set experts to China for design, so that our country's design personnel can participate in the work from beginning to end, learning while working, so that the rich knowledge and experience of each expert can be imparted to our country's design personnel through practical work. The Baiginyin Mine design of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry was originally decided to be entrusted to foreign design. Later, on the suggestion of Soviet experts, it was changed to domestic design under the guidance of experts. As a result, our country's design personnel quickly learned the technology and successfully completed the task.
    In our country's current situation, the lack of practical experience is one of the main reasons why the design level cannot be rapidly improved. It is unimaginable that design personnel lacking production and construction experience can make designs that meet the actual needs of production or construction. However, design personnel cannot stop designing and participate in production and construction, waiting until they have accumulated considerable experience before designing again. Therefore, they need to frequently visit construction sites and factories, collect production quotas and various technical and economic indicators and other data. At present, some factories and mines have excessive restrictions on design personnel going to factories for internships, visits, and collecting data, the procedures are too cumbersome, and the scope of confidentiality is too broad, even not allowing visits to the factories and mines and equipment designed by themselves. This phenomenon is really not conducive to improving our country's design level, and it is hoped that it can be quickly improved.
    The improvement of design technology level cannot be isolated, and must be improved simultaneously with scientific research and production technology level. In order to strengthen scientific research work, in addition to full-time scientific research workers, engineering and technical personnel in design institutions, especially senior engineering and technical personnel, should actively engage in scientific and technical research work in combination with design projects. Relevant leaders should put forward research tasks, stipulate research projects, and call on them to participate in relevant important scientific and technical activities. The connection between design institutes, universities, and scientific research institutions is currently very poor and should be improved. The way to do this is to establish and improve the technical meetings of the design institute and invite experts from relevant universities and scientific research institutions to participate in the technical meetings.
    Our country's design personnel must work together to strive for our country's design science and technology to reach the international level as soon as possible, and undertake the glorious task of the entire design of the national economy.

### 提高设计技术水平

    提高设计技术水平
    今年召开的全国基本建设会议订出了初步规划的目标，要求各部门分别争取在五年左右的时间内，使我国的设计力量能够基本上独立地担负起国民经济各部门基本建设的设计任务；并且争取在第三个五年计划内，使我国的设计工作水平，接近世界先进水平。这是摆在我国基本建设领导部门和设计工作人员面前的一个重大任务。
    我国的设计工作，特别是工业建设方面的设计工作，几年来的进步很快，成绩也是很显著的。现在已经集结了约计九万人的勘察设计队伍，其中工程技术人员就有四万二千多人。第一个五年计划的基本建设，除了苏联及各人民民主国家帮助设计的以外，不少的工业项目和全部的民用建筑以及铁道、公路、邮电、水利等建筑工程都是由我国设计人员担当起来的。通过工作的实践，有些工业部门也开始学会了某些企业的成套设计，积累了一定的设计资料和设计经验，并且涌现出不少优秀的设计工作者。但是，应该承认，我们的设计工作水平仍然是很低的。它还不能满足基本建设日益发展的需要，而且目前建设中的许多复杂的技术问题，我们也还不能离开苏联专家而独立解决。
    怎样才能提高我国的设计技术水平呢？逐步建立专业设计机构和实行各专业工种的专业化，是提高设计技术水平的有效措施。这是适应工业技术发展，分工日益精细的必然趋势。现在，各部根据不同的工艺要求，已经着手把任务庞杂、人数过多的设计院调整为若干专业性的设计院。这样，不仅可以使设计院减少担负多种专业设计的忙乱现象，同时还能够提高劳动生产率，缩短完工的期限，保证设计质量，迅速地掌握先进经验和更好地发挥现有设计人员的作用。但是，设计专业化的调整工作刚刚开始，今后还要很好地考虑专业化以后各专业设计机构之间的协作关系，防止工作上的脱节现象。
    为了迅速提高设计技术水平，还要加强设计人员的业务学习。我国设计人员应当把苏联、各人民民主国家和其他国家已有的科学技术成就接受过来，学会它，使用它。为了实现这一任务，第一、聘有苏联专家的设计机构，应该认真地向苏联专家学习，积极地运用苏联的先进经验并结合我国的具体情况来解决我们的实际工作问题。第二、要有计划有系统地交流和推广世界各国的建筑科学技术和设计方面的科学成就和先进经验。第三、派有经验的设计人员出国学习；或者为解决某些重大技术问题和技术复杂的成套设计，选派高级技术干部到国外学习，或从事专门技术问题的考察研究
  工作。此外，必须特别注意发挥我国设计人员
  的积极性和创造性，争取主动解决问题。组织设计人员的业务技术学习，建立巩固的业务学习制度，规定出在三年或五年内提高设计人员的具体要求，也是非常需要的。例如，有计划地请苏联专家或我国的专家及高级工程技术人员作科学技术报告，举办夜大学，开办业余的技术训练班，让青年技术员在实际工作中得到锻炼，采用带徒弟的办法，指定专人培养新生力量等等。这样，许多设计人员的技术水平就会得到迅速的提高。
    今后设计的项目应尽可能由我国的设计机构自己负担，或请苏联和各人民民主国家派遣成套专家来我国进行设计，使我国设计人员能从头到尾的参加工作，边作边学，使每一个专家丰富的学识经验都能够通过工作实践，传授给我国的设计人员。冶金工业部白银厂矿山设计，原来是决定委托国外设计的，后经苏联专家建议，改为在专家指导下由国内设计，结果，使我国的设计人员很快地学习到了技术，顺利地完成了任务。
    就我国目前的情况来说，缺乏实际经验是设计水平不能迅速提高的主要原因之一，不能想像缺乏生产和施工经验的设计人员，能够做出符合于生产或施工实际需要的设计来。但是，设计人员又不能停下设计都去参加生产和施工，等到积累相当经验以后再来设计。因此，他们需要经常到工地和工厂参观、搜集生产定额和各种技术经济指标等资料。目前有些厂矿对于设计人员到工厂实习、参观和搜集资料限制过严，手续过繁，保密范围过广，甚至连本人设计的厂矿、设备也不允许参观，这种现象，实在不利于提高我国的设计水平，希望能够迅速得到改善。
    设计技术水平的提高不可能是孤立的，必须跟科学研究和生产技术水平同时提高。为了加强科学研究工作，除专职的科学研究工作者以外，设计机构中的工程技术人员，特别是高级的工程技术人员，应该积极地结合设计项目，从事科学技术的研究工作。有关领导方面要给他们提出研究任务，规定研究项目，号召他们参加有关的重要的科学技术活动。设计院、高等院校和科学研究机构的联系目前还很差，应该设法改进，办法是建立和健全设计院的技术会议，并聘请有关的高等院校和科学研究机构的专家参加技术会议。
    我国设计人员务须一致努力，争取我国的设计科学技术早日达到国际水平，担负起国民经济的全部设计的光荣任务。
