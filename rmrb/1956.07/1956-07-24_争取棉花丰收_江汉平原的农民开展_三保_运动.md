Xinhua News Agency Report: Xinhua News Agency reporter Qu Yifan reports: Over 4.3 million mu of cotton in the Jianghan Plain of Hubei Province are in full bloom with red and white flowers. Many fruit branches near the roots have already produced tender green cotton bolls. Recently, the farmers here have launched a large-scale "Three Guarantees" campaign of guaranteeing buds, guaranteeing flowers, and guaranteeing bolls to strive for a bumper cotton harvest.

Members of the agricultural cooperatives carefully walk through the dense rows of cotton, performing tasks such as pruning, pest control, cultivation, and applying additional fertilizer. At the same time, they are also digging ditches to drain waterlogged areas and storing water to prevent drought in higher areas.

During this busy agricultural season, the farmers on the plain are determined to overcome the difficulty of insufficient labor. Many highly efficient production tools have been created and promoted. Members of agricultural cooperatives and handicraft cooperatives in Tianmen County have created four types of sprayers made of galvanized iron and bamboo tubes. More than 1,500 of these sprayers have been promoted, enabling widespread pest control on all 685,000 mu of cotton in the county, one to three times over. The county has also created and promoted two types of tools for cultivating and weeding cotton fields, with a daily work efficiency of 15 to 25 mu per two people and one ox.

This year, advanced cotton cultivation techniques have also been widely promoted on the plain. Previously, farmers here were not accustomed to pruning and cultivating soil around cotton plants; now, through extensive visits, comparisons, technical instruction, and experience exchange, most farmers have learned to prune and value cultivating soil. In Wagou Township, Mianyang County, agricultural cooperatives mobilized a total of 1,000 members to implement cotton pruning. In Tianmen County, more than 240,000 mu of cotton fields have already been pruned, accounting for 35% of the total cotton fields. Currently, cotton pruning work is still continuing in various places. In the Babao cotton area of Songzi County, a general survey of more than 100,000 mu of cotton fields revealed that 26,000 mu of cotton were growing poorly. The cotton area immediately organized 3,000 people to accumulate fertilizer and apply 2.25 million dan of additional fertilizer to these poorly growing cotton fields.

### 争取棉花丰收  江汉平原的农民开展“三保”运动

    争取棉花丰收
    江汉平原的农民开展“三保”运动
    据新华社讯　新华社记者曲一凡报道：湖北省江汉平原上四百三十多万亩棉花，盛开着红白相间的花朵，靠根部的许多果枝已经挂上了嫩绿的棉桃。最近，这里的农民开展了大规模的保蕾、保花、保桃的
  “三保”活动，以争取棉花丰收。
    农业社的社员们谨慎地在枝叶茂密的棉行里穿行，分别进行整枝、除虫、中耕、追肥等工作。同时，他们还为洼地开沟排渍，为高地蓄水防旱。
    在这农事繁忙的季节，平原上的农民决心克服劳动力不足的困难。许多效率较高的生产工具被创造出来，并且得到了推广。天门县农业社和手工业社的社员们，创造了白铁和竹筒做的四种喷雾器。这些喷雾器已经推广一千五百多部，使全县六十八万五千亩棉花普遍治虫一遍到三遍。这个县还创造和推广了两种棉田中耕除草的工具，每天两人一牛的工作效率是十五亩到二十五亩。
    今年，培育棉花的先进技术在平原上推广得也很普遍。以前，这里的农民对棉花整枝和中耕培土没有习惯；现在通过广泛的参观评比，传授技术，交流经验，大多数农民都学会了整枝，并且重视中耕培土了。沔阳县挖沟乡各农业社共发动了一千个社员实行棉花整枝。天门县已经整枝的棉田有二十四万多亩，占棉田总数的35％。目前，各地棉花整枝工作还在继续进行。松滋县八宝棉区十万多亩棉田经过普查，发现有两万六千亩棉花生长较差。这个棉区立刻组织三千人积肥，在这些生长较差的棉田里追肥二百二十五万担。
