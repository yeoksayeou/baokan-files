Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 19th. Placodermi fossils of the Arthrodira class and Crossopterygii fossils of the Holoptychius class, dating back 300 million years, have been discovered on the western slope of Leifatai in Longtan, Nanjing.

A total of five Arthrodira fossils were found, including head shields, back shields, tails, and fins. More than twenty complete scales of Holoptychius fossils were found, along with several identifiable fragments.

These fossils are preserved in the gray-black shale of the upper part of the Wutung Formation. Scientists have confirmed that such complete Arthrodira fossils are not only the first discovery in China, but also rare worldwide. The characteristics of these two fish fossils have not been seen in known species and genera.

These valuable fish fossils were discovered by Pan Jiang, an assistant technician at the Nanjing Geological Exhibition Hall of the Ministry of Geology. The field investigation team of the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences also discovered Platycephalichthys fossils (poorly preserved scales) in the Gufeng Formation (Permian) in the same area.

These discoveries not only enrich the content of paleontological research, but also provide new reference materials for studying the stratigraphic age of the Wutung Formation, comparing this stratum with other contemporary strata in China, and studying the geology of the Longtan area.

    南京发现世界稀有的盾皮鱼和总鳍鱼化石
    新华社南京19日电　在南京龙潭雷发台西坡，发现了三万万年以前的古生物——盾皮类的胴甲类鱼化石和总鳍鱼类的完褶鱼化石。
    胴甲类鱼化石共有五块，有头甲、背甲、尾部、鳍等。完褶鱼化石有完整的鳞片二十多块，还有可以鉴定的碎片若干。
    这些化石都保存在乌桐系上部的灰黑色页岩中。经科学家研究证明，像这样完整的胴甲类鱼化石，不仅在中国是第一次发现，在世界各地也是少见的。这两种鱼化石的特征在已知的种属中还未见过。
    这些珍贵的鱼化石是地质部南京地质陈列馆的助理技术员潘江发现的。中国科学院古脊椎动物研究室野外调查队，也在同一地区的孤峰层（二叠纪）内发现了扁体鱼化石（保存不很好的鳞片）。
    这些发现不仅丰富了古生物学研究的内容，并且对研究乌桐系的地层时代问题和我国这一地层与其他同时代地层的对比以及研究龙潭区域地质问题都提供了新的参考资料。
