    Engineer Wang Shu Researches a Speedy Building Block Drawing Method
    Workers Can Learn to Read Mechanical Drawings in Three Hours
    (Our Newspaper’s Report) Young engineer Wang Shu recently successfully researched a set of "Speedy Building Block Drawing Method." Using this teaching method, a mechanical worker who has absolutely no drawing reading ability can grasp the basic methods of reading mechanical drawings after about three hours of study.
      The teaching aids and materials for the "Speedy Building Block Drawing Method" are very simple. The teaching aid is a box of building blocks, with only three shapes: cube, triangular prism, and semi-cylinder, totaling twenty-three. The textbook content consists of fifty graphics of common mechanical parts constructed from building blocks, accompanied by simple textual explanations. Even workers with very low levels of education can understand the lessons and conduct self-study. The purpose of the speedy drawing acquisition is only to help workers quickly establish a three-dimensional concept.
    In late June, Wang Shu gave his first public experimental lecture at the Xuanwu District Workers' Club in Beijing. He held a set of building blocks on stage and lectured, while the workers listened and built building blocks on their desks according to the graphics. The twenty-four mechanical workers who attended the lecture learned the basic methods of reading drawings in three hours and ten minutes. Chen Shiquan, a veteran fitter with twenty-one years of experience, had been unable to understand drawings from his apprenticeship until recently. When he received a parts job, he had to work by referring to the actual object and measuring the dimensions. Now he can understand simple mechanical parts drawings.
    Wang Shu is an engineer at a factory in Beijing and has long been engaged in teaching workers' spare-time technical studies. He began researching building block drawing in late 1953. His work has received support from the factory leadership. Professors from the Department of Cartography at Beijing Normal University also helped him improve the textbook content.
    The Beijing Association for Science and Technology Popularization recently studied the "Speedy Building Block Drawing Method" and believes that it is an effective method to eliminate the phenomenon of mechanical workers not being able to read drawings and to help workers improve their skills. It has been decided to promote it throughout the city.

### 工程师王术研究出速成积木识图法  工人学三小时就能学会看机械图样

    工程师王术研究出速成积木识图法
    工人学三小时就能学会看机械图样
    本报讯　青年工程师王术最近研究成功一套“速成积木识图法”。采用这种方法教学，一个完全没有看图能力的机械工人，只要经过大约三小时的学习，就能掌握看机械图样的基本方法。
      “速成积木识图法”的教具和教材都很简单。教具是一盒积木，只有三种形状：正立方体、三角体和半圆体，共二十三个。教材内容是五十幅由积木构成的常见机械零件的图形，附以简单的文字说明。就是文化程度很低的工人都能听懂课程和进行自修。速成识图的目的只是在于帮助工人迅速树立立体观念。
    六月下旬，王术在北京宣武区工人俱乐部第一次作公开实验讲授。他拿了一付积木在台上讲着，工人们一面听讲，一面在课桌上照着图形搭积木。参加听讲的二十四名机械工人在三小时零十分钟内，学会了看图的基本方法。二十一年工龄的老钳工陈石泉，从学徒时候起，一直到不久以前，还看不懂图，来了零件活，一定要照着实物，量着尺寸，才能工作。现在他已能看懂简单的机械零件的图纸。
    王术是北京某工厂的工程师，曾经长期担任工人业余技术学习的教学工作。他从1953年末起开始研究积木识图。他的工作得到工厂领导方面的支持。北京师范大学制图系的教授们也帮助他改进了教材内容。
    北京市科学技术普及协会最近研究了“速成积木识图法”，认为这是消灭机械工人中不认识图样的现象，帮助工人提高技术的有效方法，已经决定在全市范围内推广。
