Xinhua News Agency, Linyi, 11th July. The Sino-Hungarian Friendship Agricultural Machine Tractor Station concluded its summer operations today. The summer operations of the tractor station began on June 7th. During this period, the tractor station harvested 1,225 mu of wheat, threshed 3.8 million jin, summer plowed 1,699 mu, and harrowed 2,583 mu for twenty-seven agricultural production cooperatives and two state-owned farms. Additionally, it sowed 615 mu of corn and soybeans.

Originally, the tractor station planned to use five threshing machines to help ten agricultural cooperatives and two state-owned farms thresh 1.91 million jin of wheat. However, during the wheat harvest season, there were continuous overcast and rainy days, and many agricultural cooperatives that had not signed contracts requested the tractor station to help them with threshing. Therefore, from late June onwards, the station devoted all its efforts to helping agricultural cooperatives thresh wheat and also put five combine harvesters into the threshing work.

After helping the agricultural cooperatives in the service area thresh wheat, it also helped ten agricultural cooperatives outside the service area thresh wheat. During the threshing period, the staff of the station worked actively. At the most intense time, one threshing machine threshed as much as 60,000 jin of wheat in one shift (ten hours). This resulted in the total amount of wheat threshed by the station exceeding the original plan by nearly double.

    中匈友谊拖拉机站帮助许多农业社割麦脱粒
    新华社临沂11日电　中匈友谊农业机器拖拉机站在今天结束了夏季作业。拖拉机站的夏季作业是从六月七日开始的，在这个期间，拖拉机站为二十七个农业生产合作社和两个国营农场收割小麦1，225亩、脱粒三百八十万斤、夏耕1，699亩、耙地2，583亩，另外还播种玉米、大豆615亩。
    拖拉机站原来计划用五台脱谷机帮助十个农业社和两个国营农场脱粒小麦一百九十一万斤，但是在麦收期间，当地阴雨连绵，许多原来没有签订合同的农业社又要求拖拉机站帮助他们脱粒，于是该站从六月下旬开始全力帮助农业社脱粒小麦，并且把五台联合收割机也投入了脱粒工作。
    在帮助服务区的农业社脱粒小麦以后，还帮助服务区以外的十个农业社脱粒了小麦。在脱粒期间，这个站上的人员积极工作，在最紧张的时候，一台脱粒机在一个班次（十小时）内曾脱粒小麦达六万斤。这样就使全站脱粒小麦的数量比原计划超过了将近一倍。
