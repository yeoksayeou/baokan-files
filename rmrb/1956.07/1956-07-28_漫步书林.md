    Wandering Through the Book Forest
    Wang Zhen: "Nong Shu" (Agricultural Treatise) (Part 2) Xidi
    This "Nong Shu" is the most detailed compilation of agricultural science before Xu Guangqi's "Complete Treatise on Agriculture," adapting to the times and local conditions, creatively and practically describing many farming and reeling techniques. There is not a single empty talk, and no unrealistic fantasies. The author summarized the actual experience of the farmers, so it is by no means a book of "closed-door fabrication." We should regard this book as a compulsory textbook in agricultural schools.
    The author of this book, Wang Zhen, has an unknown life, only knowing that he "named Bo Shan, from Dongping, once served as the magistrate of Fengcheng County (note: should be 'Yongfeng')." He himself said that he once served as the magistrate of Jingde County in Xuanzhou. In the "Jingde County Chronicle" Volume 7 "Biography of Officials and Teachers" of the Shunzhi thirteenth year edition, I indeed found a piece of material about him: "Appointed in the first year of Yuanzhen (1295 AD). A person from Donglu. He repaired the school palace, built the Zunjing Pavilion, managed altars, temples, bridges, and roads, and gave medicine to help people." "Nong Shu" began to be written at that time. In order to print "Nong Shu", he created wooden movable type. "Tried to print the county chronicles, about 60,000 words, and a hundred copies were completed in less than a month, just like engraving on boards, and then realized it was usable." Two years later, he was transferred to Yongfeng County in Xinzhou. He carried this set of movable type with him to his post. At this time, his "Nong Shu" had already been written. "Just as he was about to print it with movable type," he learned that Jiangxi had already ordered workers to print it on boards, so he stopped.
    As for the versions of "Nong Shu", in addition to the Jiajing edition, I have seen a copy of the Ming "Wanli two years, Jiaxu (1574) Jinan Prefecture Zhangqiu County publication" in Shanghai (the "Nong Shu" in the Fujian reprinted "Wuyingdian Juzhen Edition Series" is from this Shandong edition of the Wanli year), which is obviously a reprint of the Jiajing edition. Qian Zeng's "Reading Books and Seeking Knowledge" records Wang's "Nong Shu", saying, "Six volumes of 'General Principles of Farming and Sericulture', twenty volumes of 'Illustrated Manual of Agricultural Tools', ten volumes of 'Spectrum of Grains', collectively named 'Nong Shu'." The content is exactly the same as the Jiajing edition. However, he did not specify the version, and did not know whether he collected the Jiajing edition or the Wanli edition. When Qianlong of the Qing Dynasty compiled the "Complete Library of the Four Treasuries", he collected this "Nong Shu" from the "Yongle Encyclopedia". According to the catalog of the "Great Encyclopedia", volumes six hundred and twenty-five to six hundred and forty, a total of sixteen volumes, all contain "Nong Shu", only under "Nong Shu" fourteen and fifteen", it is noted: "'Essentials of Farming and Sericulture'", and under "Nong Shu" sixteen", it is noted: "'Essentials of Farming, Sericulture, Food, and Clothing'". Under "Nong Shu" one to "Nong Shu" thirteen", no book title is noted. "Summary of the 'Complete Library of the Four Treasuries Nong Shu'" says: "The contents of the Yongle Encyclopedia are eight volumes", then eight of them are Wang Zhen's "Nong Shu". As for what the remaining five volumes are, it is now impossible to know. I once collated the "Nong Shu" from the "Great Encyclopedia" itself with the Jiajing edition, and there were not many differences, indicating that the "Great Encyclopedia" contains Wang's complete book, and is closest to the original appearance of Wang's original book. However, the "Great Encyclopedia" has Wang's "Preface to Nong Shu", which says: "It is a collection of thirty-seven, with two hundred and seventy items" (the Jiajing edition does not have this preface). The "Great Encyclopedia" combines it into eight volumes, and the Jvzhen version divides it into twenty-two volumes, only the Jiajing edition makes thirty-six collections, still retaining the original scale. What is the basis for the Jvzhen version to be divided into twenty-two volumes? According to the "Summary", it is based on the "Reading Books and Seeking Knowledge". But the various "Reading Books and Seeking Knowledge" we have seen have never divided "Nong Shu" into twenty-two volumes. I don't know what version of "Reading Books and Seeking Knowledge" the academicians saw at that time. Fortunately, the original book's table of contents is all there, so it is not difficult to restore the original appearance of the original book. This part of the "Nong Shu" which is made up of thirty-seven collections, hoping to be able to reprint and publish soon. Now, not to mention the Jiajing edition, or the Wanli edition of "Nong Shu" has disappeared from the market, even the Jvzhen version, the Fujian reprinted Jvzhen Edition Series (the Jiangxi and Zhejiang reprinted Jvzhen Edition Series do not have "Nong Shu"), the Guangdong Guangya Bookstore reprinted Min Jvzhen Edition Series, and even the stone-printed small-character edition, and the lead-printed edition of "Nong Shu", have become "hard to come by" things. Such an important and compulsory classic work of agricultural science is worth a few experts spending some time to sort it out as soon as possible. (The End)

    王祯：农书　（下）西谛
    这部农书是徐光启“农政全书”出版之前最详尽的农业科学的总集，因时制宜，因地制宜，创造性地而又结合实际地叙述着许多耕种、缲织的技术。没有一句空谈，没有不能见之实用的幻想。作者是把农民们的实际的经验总结起来的，所以，决不是一部“闭门造车”的书。我们应该把这部书作为农业学校里的必读的教科书才是。
    这部书的作者王祯，生平不详，只知道他“字伯善，东平人，曾官丰城（按疑应作“永丰”）县尹。”他自己说，曾任宣州旌德县县尹。我在顺治十三年刊本的“旌德县志”卷七“官师志”里，果然找到了有关于他的一段材料：“元贞元年（公元1295年）任。东鲁人。修学宫，建尊经阁，治坛、庙、桥、路，施药济人。”农书就在那时候开始写的。因为要印行农书，所以创造了木活字。“试印本县志书，约计六万余字，不一月而百部齐成，一如刊板，始知其可用。”后二年，他迁任信州永丰县。曾将这付活字携而之官。这时，他的农书已经写成了。“方欲以活字嵌印”，却知江西已经命工刊板，遂中止。
    “农书”的版本，除嘉靖本外，我曾在上海见到一部明“万历二载甲戌（1574年）济南府章丘县刊行”的本子（福建重刻“武英殿聚珍版丛书”中的“农书”即从此万历年山东刊本出），显然是翻刻那部嘉靖本。钱曾“读书敏求记”载王氏农书，说，“农桑通诀六，农器图谱二十，谷谱十，总名曰农书。”其内容正与嘉靖本同。惟他未注明版本，不知所收的是嘉靖本还是万历本。清乾隆纂修“四库全书”时，从“永乐大典”里辑出这部“农书”来。按大典目录，卷之六百二十五到卷之六百四十，共十六卷，所收皆为“农书”，惟在“农书十四、十五”下，注：“农桑辑要”，在“农书十六”下，注：“农桑衣食辑要”。在“农书一”至“农书十三”下，则并未注有书名。“四库全书农书提要”云：“永乐大典所载并为八卷”，则其中有八卷是王祯农书。至所余五卷究是何书，则今已不可得而知了。我曾将从“大典”本书的内聚珍本“农书”和嘉靖本对校了一下，异同不多，可见“大典”所收乃是王氏全书，且是最近于王氏原本的本来面目的。惟“大典”本有王氏的“农书原序”，云：“为集三十有七，为目二百有七十”（嘉靖本无此序）。“大典”既并之为八卷，内聚珍本又分之为二十二卷，只有嘉靖本作三十六集，尚存原本规模。究竟内聚珍本分作二十二卷有何根据呢？据“提要”说，是根据“读书敏求记”的。但我们所见的各本“敏求记”从没有将“农书”分作二十二卷的。不知当时馆臣所见的是何本“敏求记”。好在原书的篇目次第俱在，固不难于恢复原本的本来面目。这部分作三十有七集的恢复本来面目的“农书”希望能够早日重印出版。现在，不要说嘉靖本，或万历本“农书”已在市上绝迹，就是内聚珍本，福建重刻聚珍版丛书（江西和浙江重刻的聚珍版丛书，均无“农书”在内），广东广雅书局重刻闽聚珍版丛书，乃至石印小字本、铅印本的“农书”，也都成了“可遇不可求”之物。像这样的一部重要的而且必读的农业科学的古典著作，是值得几位专家们尽快地花费若干时日，把它整理一下的。　（完）
