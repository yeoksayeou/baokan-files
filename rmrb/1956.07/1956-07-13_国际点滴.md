    West Germany's Secret Agent Rule
    The West German government is currently strengthening its fascist secret agent rule.
    Seebohm of the All-German Bloc once said in parliament that a member of parliament was accused by the procuratorate for receiving a parcel from East Germany. Social Democratic Party member Mommer also pointed out: "An atmosphere of 'witch hunt' prevails in the Federal Republic."

    In many elementary schools in the United States, gambling has become one of the after-school activities for elementary school students. People can find some young gamblers around the age of ten squatting there, rolling dice and gambling for money in the school's garden or secluded corners. It is estimated that there are more than 50 elementary schools that have become small casinos in Philadelphia alone.
