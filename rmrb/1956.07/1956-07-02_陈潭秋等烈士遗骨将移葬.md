(Reported from our Urumqi office) The remains of martyrs Chen Tanqiu, Mao Zemin, and Lin Jilu were relocated in Urumqi on the 26th.

At 2:00 PM on the 26th, representatives from all ethnic groups of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region and Urumqi gathered in front of the martyrs' graves in Liudaowan. Wang Enmao, First Secretary of the CPC Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region Committee, Zhang Xiqin, Deputy Commander of the Xinjiang Military Region, Ren Gebai, Secretary of the CPC Urumqi Municipal Committee, and others circled the graves once before picking up shovels and digging the first shovelfuls of earth. Immediately afterwards, soldiers from the Xinjiang Military Region Production and Construction Corps exhumed the martyrs' remains and placed them in coffins. The martyrs' remains will first be moved to the People's Square in Urumqi, and then relocated to the Yan'erwo Revolutionary Martyrs' Cemetery, a scenic spot in Urumqi, on a selected date.

Martyrs Chen Tanqiu, Mao Zemin, and Lin Jilu were brutally murdered by the Chiang Kai-shek and Sheng Shicai bandit gang in September 1943. After the peaceful liberation of Xinjiang, it was only through the confession of the bandit Zhang Sixin, the murderer who personally killed the martyrs, that the location of the martyrs' remains buried in the barren hills of Liudaowan was discovered.

    陈潭秋等烈士遗骨将移葬
    本报乌鲁木齐讯　陈潭秋、毛泽民、林基路三烈士的遗骨，已于二十六日在乌鲁木齐移葬。
    二十六日下午二时，新疆维吾尔自治区和乌鲁木齐市各族各界代表，齐集六道湾烈士坟前，中共新疆维吾尔自治区委员会第一书记王恩茂、新疆军区副司令员张希钦、中共乌鲁木齐市委书记任戈白等绕坟一周后，即拿起铁铲，铲起了第一铲黄土。紧接着新疆军区生产建设部队的战士们，便将烈士的遗骨挖出并装殓入棺。烈士的遗骨将先移到乌鲁木齐市人民广场，然后择定日期移葬于乌鲁木齐风景优美的燕儿窝革命烈士陵园。
    陈潭秋、毛泽民、林基路三烈士于1943年9月惨遭蒋介石、盛世才匪帮杀害。新疆和平解放后，从亲手杀害烈士的凶犯张匪思信的口供中，始探得烈士遗体掩埋在六道湾荒山上。
