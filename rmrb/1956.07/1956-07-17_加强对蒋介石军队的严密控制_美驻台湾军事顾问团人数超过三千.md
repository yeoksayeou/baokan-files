    Intensifying Strict Control over Chiang Kai-shek's Army
    Number of US Military Advisory Group in Taiwan Exceeds Three Thousand

    Xinhua News Agency, Fujian Front, 16th—Xinhua News Agency reporter Cheng Yi reports: Chiang army personnel who returned, such as Nie Zhiwei, told reporters that the United States is currently strengthening its military occupation of Taiwan and its strict control over Chiang Kai-shek's army.

    Nie Zhiwei, the deputy company commander of a heavy weapons company in the Chiang army, who returned, said that according to some facts he heard and witnessed while in the Chiang army, the number of personnel in the U.S. Military Assistance Advisory Group in Taiwan has now increased to more than three thousand. They are not only stationed in divisions and regiments, but also in some companies and platoons. One of Nie Zhiwei's friends, when he was a platoon leader, was disciplined because he had a "bad relationship" with the American advisor. The business scope of the U.S. Military Assistance Advisory Group in Taiwan has expanded to all aspects of the Chiang army's combat, training, management of materials, ammunition, and equipment, and even life management. The Chiang army must obtain the approval of American military advisors to use a single shell or a barrel of gasoline. Their internal affairs and dress codes are often formulated and inspected by them. The U.S. military "life advisors" stationed in the Chiang army often convene relevant personnel to study so-called "food improvement."

    Nie Zhiwei and others said that currently, more officers and soldiers in the Chiang army recognize the U.S. ambition to invade Taiwan than before. The intensified control and enslavement by American military advisors has aroused dissatisfaction among the officers and soldiers of the Chiang army.

    加强对蒋介石军队的严密控制
    美驻台湾军事顾问团人数超过三千
    据新华社福建前线16日电　新华社记者成一报道：归来的蒋军人员聂智威等对记者说，目前，美国正在加强对台湾的军事占领和对蒋介石军队的严密控制。
    归来的蒋军重兵器连副连长聂智威说，根据他在蒋军部队时听到的和亲眼看到的一些事实，现在美国驻台湾军事援助顾问团的人数已经增加到三千人以上，不仅派驻到师、团，而且派驻到一部分连、排单位。聂智威的一个朋友当排长的时候，就因与美国顾问“关系不好”，受到处分。美国驻台湾军事援助顾问团的业务范围，已经扩展到蒋军各兵种部队的作战、训练、物资弹药器材管理和生活管理等各方面。蒋军部队动用一发炮弹、一桶汽油都得经过美国军事顾问的批准，蒋军的内务和着装规则也常常由他们制定和检查，驻在蒋军部队中的美军“生活顾问”还常常召集有关人员研究所谓“伙食改善”。
    聂智威等说，目前，认识美国侵略台湾的野心的蒋军官兵比以前多了。美国军事顾问的加紧控制和奴役，引起了蒋军官兵的不满。
