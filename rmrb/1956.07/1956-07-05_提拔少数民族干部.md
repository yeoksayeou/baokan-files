Promote Minority Ethnic Cadres

The Guangtong Hui Autonomous County in Gansu Province recently promoted a group of minority ethnic cadres. Among the ninety-two cadres promoted, sixty-seven were Hui and fourteen were Dongxiang.

The Guangtong County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party made unified arrangements for the work of cultivating and promoting cadres in various township branches. Each branch also carried out a comprehensive assessment and ranking of candidates. At the same time, the County Committee also provided short-term training for the cadres who were promoted.

In the work of promoting cadres, Party organizations at all levels also paid special attention to the emerging forces among minority ethnic women. This time, a total of twenty-five minority ethnic women cadres were promoted. (Gansu Daily)
