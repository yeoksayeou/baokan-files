Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, July 12th: For the past twenty-odd days, the weather in Changsha City, Hunan Province, has been hot. Relevant departments are taking urgent measures to strengthen heatstroke prevention and cooling work. On the 9th, the Industrial Department of the Changsha Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China established a special leading body and sent two working groups to ten key factories to assist in heatstroke prevention and cooling work.

Currently, many factories are using natural ventilation, roof spraying, ground sprinkling, and adding exhaust fans and heat protection equipment to reduce workshop temperatures. Some casting workshops have built earthen brick walls around the furnaces to prevent heat from radiating. On basic construction sites, cooling sheds have been set up; mobile awnings have also appeared at loading and unloading docks. The Changsha Meat Joint Processing Factory is also preparing to produce an additional 15 to 20 tons of ice per day to supply cooling for factories and enterprises throughout the city.

    长沙积极防暑降温
    据新华社长沙12日电　近二十多天来，湖南省长沙市天气炎热。有关部门正在采取紧急措施，加强防暑降温工作。九日，中共长沙市委工业部已成立了专门领导机构，另外还派出两个工作组，分赴十个重点工厂协助做好防暑降温工作。
    现在，许多工厂都利用自然通风、屋顶喷水、地面洒水和添置排气风扇、防热设备等办法，降低车间温度。有些铸工间的炉子旁边，已经砌上土砖，防止热气散发。在基本建设工地上，张起了降温工作棚；在搬运码头上，还出现了流动布篷。长沙肉类联合加工厂也准备每天多生产十五吨到二十吨冰块，供应全市工厂企业降温。
