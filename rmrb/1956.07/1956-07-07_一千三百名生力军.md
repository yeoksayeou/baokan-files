Shanghai, July 4th (report from this newspaper) Recently, another 1,300 newly trained technical workers in Shanghai will be assigned to work in mechanical, petroleum, power and other departments in various regions. They were trained by two mechanical training classes and one welding training class organized by the Shanghai Municipal Labor Bureau. In the past, these people were unemployed people and young people waiting to learn skills. Last year, the Shanghai Municipal Labor Bureau recruited them into technical training classes and conducted about a year of study. Now they have technical skills of level three or four in lathe work, fitter work, and welding.
