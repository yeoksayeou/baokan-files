    Over Ten Thousand Townships Complete Mountain Production Planning

    (Our report) The Ministry of Forestry convened a symposium on mountain production planning work in late June. Representatives from eleven provinces (and cities), including Hebei, Henan, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Jilin, Hubei, Jiangxi, Sichuan, Zhejiang, Guangdong, and Beijing, participated in the meeting.

    The symposium studied the situation of mountain production planning. Over the past two years, 23 provinces (autonomous regions) and 458 counties across the country have carried out mountain production planning work, and 11,900 townships have completed their plans.

    Through discussions and exchange of experiences, the representatives unanimously agreed that in carrying out mountain production planning work, it is necessary to have unified leadership and unified steps. Relevant departments such as agriculture, forestry, water conservancy, and animal husbandry should proceed from the overall interests, coordinate and cooperate, and prevent the erroneous practice of only emphasizing the business of their own departments and each doing its own thing. It is necessary to rely on the masses to make the plans practical and feasible.

    At the symposium, Li Fanwu, Vice Minister of Forestry, gave instructions. He pointed out that mountain production planning is an important task related to the rational utilization of land, soil and water conservation, and planned development of production. All localities should seize the opportunity to establish specialized institutions, train cadres, and other preparations, and step up this work.

    一万多个乡完成山区生产规划
    本报讯　林业部在六月下旬召开了山区生产规划工作座谈会。参加会议的有河北、河南、山西、陕西、吉林、湖北、江西、四川、浙江、广东、北京等十一个省（市）的代表。
    座谈会上研究了山区生产规划的情况，两年来全国有二十三个省（区）、四百五十八个县开展了山区生产规划工作，有一万一千九百个乡完成了规划。
    经过座谈交流经验，代表们一致认为在开展山区生产规划工作中，必须统一领导，统一步调，农、林、水、牧等有关部门应从整体利益出发，协同配合，防止只强调本部门的业务、各搞一套的错误作法，必须依靠群众，才能把规划订得切实可行。
    座谈会上，林业部副部长李范五作了指示，他指出：山区生产规划是关系合理利用土地、保持水土、有计划地发展生产的一项重要工作，各地应该抓紧建立专门机构、训练干部等项准备，加紧开展这一工作。
