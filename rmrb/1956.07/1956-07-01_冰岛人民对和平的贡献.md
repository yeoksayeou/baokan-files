The current situation presents a new picture: almost every day we can see the growth of forces striving for peace and national independence, and the victories they have achieved.

The results of the Icelandic parliamentary elections on June 24 are another vivid example. The Icelandic parties demanding the expulsion of the American occupation forces from Icelandic territory – the huge Keflavik Air Base – have achieved victory and strengthened their majority in parliament. Among them, the Progressive Party and the Social Democratic Party election alliance won twenty-five of the fifty-two seats in parliament, an increase of three seats; the "People's Union," composed of the Unified Socialist Party and left-wing Social Democrats, received eight seats; while the Independence Party, the only party that supported the continued stationing of American troops in Iceland, was reduced from twenty-one seats to nineteen. The Associated Press acknowledged in its report: "This is a serious setback for the Independence Party and the American cause."

The Icelandic people have waged an unyielding struggle to expel the American occupation forces. On March 26, the Progressive Party recalled its cabinet members in the Thor's cabinet in opposition to the government's policy of allowing American troops to continue to be stationed in Iceland, forcing the Independence Party government to resign. On March 28, the Icelandic parliament, with the joint vote of the Unified Socialist Party, the Progressive Party, the Social Democratic Party, and the National Preservation Party, passed a resolution demanding the withdrawal of American troops from Iceland.

In the parliamentary election campaign, the electoral alliance formed by the Progressive Party and the Social Democratic Party, the People's Party, and other parties all took the abolition of American military bases in Iceland and the demand for the revision of the "Defense" Agreement, which was forcibly signed with the United States in 1951, as their main campaign platform. However, the ruling party, the Independence Party, continued to adhere to its policy of violating national interests. The Icelandic Prime Minister, Thor, of the Independence Party, even publicly stated on the eve of the election that if the Independence Party won the election, it would change the parliament's decision.

The results of the Icelandic parliamentary elections reflect the Icelandic people's firm will to safeguard peace and national independence and oppose the American occupation. The Icelandic "People's Will" pointed out: "The main lesson of this election is that the vast majority of people in the country demand that the American troops leave the country immediately. The alliance between the Progressive Party and the Social Democratic Party seized some seats from the Independence Party because the alliance declared that it would immediately end the occupation treaty and remove the troops from our country."

The United States has relied on not leaving Iceland after World War II, and has forcibly dragged Iceland into the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and coerced Iceland into signing the "Defense" Agreement, preparing to use Iceland as a military springboard for a new war. This is a blatant violation of Iceland's national sovereignty and a serious threat to Iceland's security. The peace-loving Icelandic people with a strong sense of national self-esteem, of course, cannot tolerate the continuation of this humiliating day.

However, Washington has always shown the colonialists' usual arrogant attitude towards the Icelandic people's national demands. Dulles once openly stated that the Icelandic parliament's decision to demand the withdrawal of American troops from Iceland "has no effect internationally." Now, although Dulles admits that the forces of the parties demanding the complete withdrawal of American troops have grown in the Icelandic elections, he still refuses to admit that American troops must withdraw from Iceland, but only says that he wants to "reduce" the military personnel there. Moreover, Dulles also played a rogue trick, insisting that "the United States did not set up a base in Iceland based on its own requirements, but as an agent of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization," and that "the final decision on this issue must be made by it, not by us." Obviously, the United States is trying to evade Iceland's legitimate demands and push the matter to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Everyone knows that the United States dominates the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. It will be able to use this organization to put pressure on Iceland in order to achieve the goal of continuing to occupy Iceland. However, the Icelandic people see very clearly that it is the American troops who are occupying Icelandic territory, and the basis for the American troops' occupation of Iceland is the "Defense Agreement" that the United States forced Iceland to sign. And even according to this agreement, American troops must withdraw from Iceland within eighteen months after Iceland makes this request. No excuses can be used to evade it.

Dulles played this despicable trick because the means of threats and inducements they used against Iceland had all failed. When the Icelandic parliament passed the resolution, the Associated Press reported: "The United States will try to dissuade Icelanders from implementing this proposal through diplomatic channels." The New York "Daily News" even blatantly demanded that the US government "put all possible pressure on the Icelandic government to ignore the parliament's decision." In addition, the American propaganda machine also spread a lot of fallacies, saying that the withdrawal of American troops would cause Iceland to lose its "source of dollars" and "affect the island's economy." The American masters, who have always relied on clubs and dollars to impose their will on others, thought that this would be enough to make Iceland, a small country, bow its head. It would never have thought that Iceland would dare to stand up straight and insist on its just demands. The Icelandic Foreign Minister, Gudmundsson of the Progressive Party, officially sent a note to the United States on June 11, requesting the revision of the "Defense" Agreement and the withdrawal of the American occupation forces from Iceland. This is a just response to the American "pressure."

In order to continue occupying Iceland, the executor of the American "policy of strength" once again trotted out the ghost story of "Soviet aggression threat," insisting that the United States has the responsibility to continue stationing troops in Iceland for the "security of the free world." But these long-debunked lies can no longer deceive the Icelandic people, but only prove that the American Cold War forces use this unfounded "threat" as an excuse to cover up their own acts of infringing upon the sovereignty of other countries. The Icelandic Foreign Minister, Gudmundsson, pointed out that the United States "wants to establish a base in Iceland to protect its own security, but this is not safe for Iceland." Even "US News & World Report" had to admit that "few people in Iceland worry about Soviet aggression," and what the United States is really afraid of is that "Iceland is gradually moving away from the United States and towards neutralism." The Icelandic people firmly recognize that only by abolishing foreign military bases, abolishing obligations to aggressive military blocs, and pursuing a policy of peaceful neutrality can they truly guarantee the security of their own country and world peace.

The Icelandic people's just struggle is part of the movement of people all over the world against American war and colonial forces. Recently, in the British Isles, Okinawa Island, Japan, and the newly independent Morocco..., the movement of people demanding the withdrawal of American troops from their sacred homeland is emerging like a wave. More and more people believe that the current international tension has eased, the "Cold War" should end, aggressive military blocs should be abolished, and the countless military bases established by the United States in various places should be removed. The heroic struggle of the Icelandic people is a valuable contribution to peace. It has given a new blow to the "policy of strength," further sharpened the contradictions within the Atlantic military bloc, and is undoubtedly a powerful encouragement to this movement of people everywhere, and a true irony to the governments of Western powers that still tolerate the American military occupation.

Now, the task facing the Icelandic people is still arduous. What is particularly worthy of the Icelandic people's vigilance is that, according to Western news agencies, the American occupiers are trying their best to provoke relations between the Icelandic parties, attempting to divide Iceland's patriotic forces, and creating difficulties in organizing a new government, in order to prevent Iceland from taking formal measures to demand the withdrawal of American troops from Iceland. This requires the Icelandic people to continue to unite and carry out a struggle to the end to defeat the conspiracy of the foreign occupiers. In their just struggle, they will be able to continue to receive the support of peace-loving people all over the world.

### 冰岛人民对和平的贡献

    冰岛人民对和平的贡献
    非昔
    目前局势出现了这样一种新的景象：几乎每天都可以看到争取和平和民族独立的力量的增长，和他们所取得的胜利。
    六月二十四日冰岛议会选举的结果，就是又一个生动的例证。要求把美国占领军赶出冰岛的领土——庞大的凯夫拉维克空军基地的冰岛各党派，取得了胜利，加强了它们在议会中的多数，其中进步党和社会民主党选举联盟获得议会五十二席中的二十五席，增加了三席；统一社会党和左翼社会民主党人参加的“人民联合”得到了八席；而唯一赞成美军继续驻在冰岛的独立党由二十一席削减到十九席。合众社在报道中承认：“对独立党人和美国的事业来说，这是一次严重的挫败”。
    冰岛人民曾经为驱逐美国占领军作了不屈的斗争。三月二十六日，进步党为反对政府让美军继续驻扎冰岛的政策，召回了它在托尔斯内阁中的阁员，迫使独立党政府辞了职。二十八日，冰岛议会在统一社会党、进步党、社会民主党和民族保护党的联合投票下，通过了要求美军撤出冰岛的决议。
    在这次议会选举的竞选中，进步党和社会民主党结成的选举联盟、人民党和其他党派都以废除在冰岛的美军基地、要求修改1951年被迫同美国签订的“防御”协定，作为主要的竞选纲领。但是执政党—独立党却继续坚持它的违反民族利益的政策。冰岛总理、独立党的托尔斯直到选举的前夕，还公开表示：独立党如果在选举中获胜，将改变议会的决定。
    冰岛议会选举的结果，反映了冰岛人民坚决维护和平和民族独立，反对美国占领的坚强意志。冰岛“人民意志报”指出：“这次选举的主要教训是国内绝大多数的人要求美国军队立即离开这个国家。进步党和社会民主党的联盟从独立党夺取了一些席位，是因为这个联盟宣布它将立即结束占领条约和使军队撤离我国”。
    美国在第二次世界大战以后赖在冰岛不走，还把冰岛强行拉进北大西洋公约，并胁迫冰岛签订了“防御”协定，准备把冰岛作为新战争的军事跳板，这是对冰岛民族主权的粗暴侵犯和对冰岛安全的严重威胁。爱好和平的富有民族自尊心的冰岛人民，当然不能容忍这种屈辱的日子继续下去。
    但是，华盛顿对于冰岛人民的民族要求，一直表现了殖民主义者惯有的专横态度。杜勒斯曾公然声言冰岛议会要求美军撤出冰岛的决定“在国际上是没有实施的效力的”。现在，杜勒斯虽然承认冰岛选举中要求美军全部撤退的政党势力增长了，但他仍然不肯承认美军必须撤退冰岛，而仅说要“减少”在那里的军事人员。而且，杜勒斯还耍了一套无赖手法，硬说：“美国并不是根据它自己的要求而是作为北大西洋公约组织的一个代理人在冰岛设置基地的”，“在这个问题上的最后决定必须由它而不是由我们作出”。很显然，美国是企图规避冰岛对它提出的正当要求，把事情推给北大西洋公约组织。谁都知道，在北大西洋公约组织中占支配地位的是美国。它将能够利用这个组织来对冰岛加施压力，以达到继续占领冰岛的目的。但是，冰岛人民看得很清楚，占领冰岛领土的是美国军队，作为美军占领冰岛的根据的是美国强迫冰岛签订的“防御协定”。而即使依照这个协定，美军也必须在冰岛提出这个要求后十八个月内撤出冰岛。不能用任何借口来推托。
    杜勒斯耍出这一卑劣手段，是因为他们对冰岛所使用的威胁利诱的手段都一一失败了。当冰岛议会通过决议后，合众社就报道：“美国将通过外交途径设法劝阻冰岛人实施这个建议。”纽约“每日新闻”更毫不遮掩地要求美国政府“给冰岛政府一切可能的压力，使它不理会议会的这个决议。”除此之外，美国宣传机器还大量散布一种谬论，说什么美军的撤出将使冰岛失掉“美元来源”，“影响这个岛的经济”。一贯依靠大棒和金元来把自己的意志强加于人的美国老爷们，以为这将足以使弹丸之地的冰岛俯首贴耳了，它决不会想到冰岛竟敢于挺住腰身，坚持自己的正义要求。冰岛外长、进步党的格德门森已在六月十一日正式照会美国，要求修改“防御”协定，把美国占领军撤出冰岛，这就是对美国的“压力”的一个正当的答复。
    美国“实力政策”执行者为继续占领冰岛，又搬出了关于“苏联侵略威胁”的鬼话，硬说美国有责任为“自由世界的安全”继续在冰岛驻军。但这些早已被揭破的谎言再也欺骗不了冰岛人民，反而只是证明美国冷战势力借口这种莫须有的“威胁”来掩护它自己对别国主权的侵犯行为。冰岛外长格德门森就指责说：美国“想要在冰岛建立一个基地来保卫它自己的安全，但是这对冰岛说来并不安全。”连“美国新闻与世界报道”也不得不承认，冰岛“很少有人担心苏联的侵略，”而美国真正害怕的是“冰岛正在渐渐离开美国而走向中立主义。”冰岛人民坚定地认识到，只有废除外国军事基地，取消对侵略性军事集团承担的义务，执行和平中立的政策，才能真正保障自己的国家的安全和全世界的和平。
    冰岛人民的正义斗争是全世界各地人民反对美国战争和殖民势力的运动的一部分。近来，在英伦三岛、冲绳岛、日本，以及新近获得独立的摩洛哥……，人民要求美军撤离他们神圣国土的运动正像浪潮一样涌现出来。越来越多的人认为，目前国际紧张局势已趋向缓和，“冷战”应当结束，侵略性军事集团应当取消，美国在各地建立的无数军事基地应当撤除。冰岛人民的英勇斗争，是对和平的宝贵贡献。它给了“实力政策”以新的打击，使大西洋军事集团内部矛盾进一步尖锐化，对于各地人民的这一运动无疑是一个有力的鼓舞，而对那些迄今还容忍美军占领的西方大国的政府是一个真正的讽刺。
    现在，冰岛人民面临的任务还是艰巨的。特别值得冰岛人民警惕的是，根据西方通讯社的消息，美国占领者正在竭力挑拨冰岛各党派之间的关系，企图分化冰岛的爱国力量，并制造组织新政府的困难，来阻挠冰岛采取要求美军撤出冰岛的正式措施。这要求冰岛人民继续团结一致进行坚持到底的斗争，来击败外国占领者的阴谋。在他们的正义斗争中，他们是能够继续得到全世界爱好和平人民的支持的。
