    Make Toys More Durable
    Around this year's "June 1st" Children's Day, the nursery of the former Ministry of Heavy Industry bought some toys for the children, such as trains, small cars, and large trucks. When they were first brought out, the children were very happy and took great care of these toys, but after playing with them for less than two hours, the wheels fell off the cars, and the beautiful cars were no longer able to move. Such flimsy toys not only fail to cultivate children's love for toys but instead create a sense of aversion to them. I hope that toy factories will make more toys that are both attractive and durable. (Bao Yu)

    把玩具做得结实些
    今年“六一”儿童节前夕，前重工业部保育院给儿童们买了一些火车、小汽车、大卡车等玩具。刚拿出来的时候，孩子们都很高兴，也非常爱护这些玩具，但是玩不了两个钟头，车上的轮子就掉下来了，很漂亮的车子一动也不动了。这样不结实的玩具不但不能培养孩子们喜爱玩具的品性，反而使他们产生一种厌恶玩具的情绪。我希望玩具工厂多做些又好看又结实的玩具。　（保玉）
