Xinhua News Agency, citing a Polish Press Agency report: Soviet Council of Ministers Chairman Bulganin and Soviet Defense Minister Marshal Zhukov, at the invitation of Polish Defense Minister Marshal Rokossovsky, visited the Polish Ministry of Defense on July 27th.

    Polish United Workers' Party and government leaders Ochab, Zawadzki, Cyrankiewicz and others attended the meeting.

    Zhukov gave a speech at the meeting. He spoke of the struggle of the Polish and Soviet peoples side by side against German fascism, and also spoke of how the Polish people, like the working people of other countries in the socialist family, have the best conditions to further prosper their economy and culture, and strive for new achievements in the construction of a socialist society.

    Zhukov said: "The Communist Party of the Soviet Union openly and resolutely opposes the cult of personality. The cult of personality is a phenomenon that is clearly incompatible with Marxism-Leninism. However, the struggle against the cult of personality does not at all mean denying the role of leaders or negating the role of authority in general. It is a serious misunderstanding in some places to confuse the cult of personality with the issue of one-man command in the military. We believe that anyone who tries to interpret the struggle against the cult of personality as a struggle against one-man command is doing a bad thing for improving the combat effectiveness of the armed forces."

    Zhukov emphasized that the unity of the armies of the socialist camp is based on the consistency of internationalist tasks and the fraternal friendship of the people of all countries. He also briefly pointed out the basic measures of military training in major capitalist countries and the characteristics of modern military art.

    朱可夫指出同心同德决定社会主义各国军队的团结
    新华社据波兰通讯社报道　苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁和苏联国防部长朱可夫元帅应波兰国防部长罗科索夫斯基元帅的邀请，在七月二十七日访问了波兰国防部。
    波兰统一工人党和政府的领导人奥哈布、萨瓦茨基、西伦凯维兹等人参加了这次会见。
    朱可夫在会见时致词。他谈到了波兰人民和苏联人民并肩反对德国法西斯的斗争，并且谈到波兰人民，也同社会主义大家庭其他各国劳动人民一样，有最好的条件来进一步繁荣经济和文化，争取社会主义社会建设的新成就。
    朱可夫说：“苏联共产党公开地、坚决地反对个人崇拜。个人崇拜是显然同马克思列宁主义不相容的一种现象。但是，反对个人崇拜的斗争完全不是说要否认领导者的作用，要一概否定权威的作用。一些地方把个人崇拜和军队中的一长指挥制问题混淆在一起，这是个严重的误解。我们认为，谁要是想把反对个人崇拜的斗争解释成反对一长指挥制的斗争，那他就给提高武装部队的战斗力作了件坏事。”
    朱可夫强调指出社会主义阵营各国军队的团结，是基于国际主义任务的一致性和各国人民兄弟友谊之上的。他还扼要地指出了主要资本主义国家军事训练的基本措施和现代军事艺术的特点。
