Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, July 26th: Saigon dispatch: In recent days, Saigon newspapers have been filled with headlines like these: "Cost of living skyrockets, salaried class cries bitterly," "Price increases are abnormal, panic buying is rampant in the market."

The newspapers report that the cost of living in Saigon has risen by 100% to 200% in one year. In the past month alone, food prices have risen by 40%, and prices in other parts of South Vietnam have followed suit. However, the wages of workers and staff have not increased for several years, making life unbearably difficult. Many newspapers have published commentaries calling for adjustments to employee salaries.

In Saigon and other parts of South Vietnam, there is also a serious shortage of imported goods and local products. In Saigon, it is almost impossible to buy flour, sugar, and condensed milk.

People from all walks of life in South Vietnam and newspaper opinion are very dissatisfied with the current situation and demand that the Ngo Dinh Diem regime quickly come up with a solution.

    南越物价狂涨人民苦
    据新华社河内26日电　西贡消息：最近几天西贡报纸上不断出现这些大字标题：“生活指数直线上升，薪水阶级叫苦连天”、“物价高涨出乎常轨，市上抢购之风炽烈”。
    报纸报道说，西贡的生活指数在一年内上涨了100％到200％。在最近一个月内，食品的价格竟涨了40％，南越其他各地的物价也跟着上涨。但是，工人、职员的薪金几年来没有增加，生活苦不堪言。许多报纸发表评论，要求调整职工的薪金。
    在西贡和南越各地，还出现了进口货和土产品严重缺货的情况，在西贡几乎买不到面粉、白糖和炼乳。
    南越各阶层人民和报纸舆论对目前情况都非常不满，要求吴庭艳政权赶快拿出办法来。
