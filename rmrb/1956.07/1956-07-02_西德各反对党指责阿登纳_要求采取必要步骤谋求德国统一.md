Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, June 30th: Bonn dispatch: The Adenauer government's rigid foreign policy has been severely criticized by opposition parties in the West German Bundestag.

    The Social Democratic Party, the Free Democratic Party, and the Refugee Party, in debates on June 28th and 29th, advised the West German government to be flexible in its relations with Western countries and to take advantage of the current changes in the international situation to seek the restoration of German unity.
    Social Democratic Party Chairman Ollenhauer, on June 29th, attacked the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's policies for hindering German reunification. He demanded that the West German government revise its policy of joining the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and take the necessary steps on the issue of German reunification. He said that if the West German government did not have the power to take measures to restore German unity, it should be done by a new government and a new Bundestag.
    He advocated the establishment of normal relations between West Germany and the Soviet Union and other People's Democratic countries, the signing of a trade agreement with the People's Republic of China, and the expansion of economic, cultural, and personal contacts between the two Germanys. However, he opposed political negotiations between the two Germanys.
    Foreign Minister von Brentano, on June 28th, issued a policy statement on behalf of the government, rejecting the opposition's proposals to intensify efforts for German reunification. The statement said: The government will neither propose nor accept any reunification plan that would separate West Germany from the Atlantic Alliance. The statement indicated that the West German government cannot currently establish diplomatic relations with Eastern European People's Democratic countries, but it also stated that "this does not mean that the Federal Government has no intention of establishing normal relations with them."
    This statement was opposed by 135 parliamentarians at the end of the debate on June 29th, with 220 in favor and seven abstentions.

    西德各反对党指责阿登纳
    要求采取必要步骤谋求德国统一
    据新华社柏林30日电　波恩消息：阿登纳政府僵硬的外交政策在西德联邦议院受到反对党派的严厉指责。
    社会民主党、自由民主党和难民党在六月二十八、二十九日两天的辩论中劝告西德政府变通它同西方国家的关系，利用目前国际局势的变化求得恢复德国统一。
    社会民主党主席奥伦豪尔六月二十九日抨击北大西洋集团政策阻碍了德国重新统一。他要求西德政府修改使西德加入北大西洋公约的政策，并且在统一德国的问题上采取必要的步骤。他说，如果西德政府没有力量采取措施恢复德国统一，就应该由新的政府和新的联邦议院来作。
    他主张西德同苏联和其他人民民主国家建立正常关系，主张同中华人民共和国签订贸易协定，并且主张扩大两个德国之间的经济、文化和个人的接触。不过他反对在两个德国之间进行政治谈判。
    外交部长勃伦达诺在六月二十八日代表政府发表一篇政策声明，拒绝反对党提出来的有关加紧进行德国的重新统一的一些建议。声明说：政府既不会提出也不会接受将使西德同大西洋集团分开的任何统一计划。声明表示西德政府目前不能同东欧人民民主国家建立外交关系，它同时表示“这并不意味着联邦政府无意和它们建立正常的关系”。
    这个声明在六月二十九日辩论结束表决时遭到135个议员反对，赞成的有220个人，七个人弃权。
