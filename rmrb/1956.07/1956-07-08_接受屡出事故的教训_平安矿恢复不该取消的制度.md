Xinhua News Agency, Fuxin, July 6th. The Party organization and administrative safety inspection departments of Fuxin Ping'an Mine are taking concrete measures to correct the neglect of safety. Now, the mine has added safety content to its daily production meetings, studying safety issues while studying production. All 373 labor protection inspectors in the mine are also active underground, reporting situations to the safety inspection department at any time.

From January to May this year, Ping'an Mine in Fuxin continuously experienced personal injury accidents. In order to correct this serious phenomenon of frequent accidents, the entire mine conducted a comprehensive safety inspection, exposing and criticizing the thinking of leaders at all levels who emphasized production and neglected safety. Now, in this mine, some rules and regulations that were effective in the past but were not seriously implemented or were cancelled as outdated restrictions in this year's production, have been gradually restored; the technical department has also newly formulated safety regulations for the tunneling faces that previously had no safety regulations. The mine also sent people to the Jiaozuo Coal Mine to learn about safety experience and reorganized the labor protection inspector organization, which had long been without responsible leadership. Monthly safety measures have been included in the production plan. Safety activity days for conducting regular safety education for workers have also been restored.

    接受屡出事故的教训
    平安矿恢复不该取消的制度
    新华社阜新6日电　阜新平安矿的党组织和行政安全检查部门，正在采取具体措施纠正忽视安全的现象。现在，这个矿在每天的生产会议里已经增添了安全的内容，在研究生产的同时，也研究安全问题。全矿373名劳动保护检查员也在井下活动起来，随时向安全检查部门报告情况。
    阜新平安矿今年一月到五月里，曾经不断发生人身事故。为了纠正这种事故频繁的严重现象，全矿普遍进行了安全检查，对各级领导人员只重生产不顾安全的思想进行了揭发和批判。现在，在这个矿里，已经把过去行之有效而在今年生产中没有认真执行和当作清规戒律取消了的一些规程制度，逐步恢复实行起来；对过去没有保安规程的掘进掌子，也由技术部门新制定出保安规程。这个矿还派人到焦作煤矿学习了安全经验，并且重新整顿了长期无人负责领导的劳动保护检查员组织。每月的安全措施已经列入生产计划。向工人进行经常性安全教育的安全活动日，也恢复了。
