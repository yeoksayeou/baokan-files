According to reader letters, the film projection team and drama troupe in Guoyang County, Anhui Province, like to cooperate in performances, that is, films and dramas are shown one after another, and film tickets and drama tickets are sold together, called "unified tickets." After watching the first show, the audience has to watch the next show. Of course, the audience can give up something they don't want to watch. However, the ticket price has been "unified," and giving up is equivalent to sacrifice and waste. Therefore, the audience expressed dissatisfaction.

The person who created the "unified ticket" method may be in order to meet the cultural needs of the people as much as possible, or to step up the ideological education of the masses? Anyway, it's out of great enthusiasm. But, you see, if you take coercive measures in doing things, even good things can be done badly, even if it is forcing people to entertain themselves.

Maybe it's not for the above purpose, that's another matter.

Our foreign friends warmly praise our drama, which is naturally very appreciable, and many plays are good. However, when he indulges in some of our works with formulaic and conceptual shortcomings, one cannot help but smile wryly. He said:

"The audience in the theater even agrees to a certain extent with the way in which ideological, political and economic issues are discussed on stage...they welcome this plot...they are even interested in very long, tedious dialogues, discussions and persuasion work. The dialogues, discussions and persuasion work are...between an engineer with a lack of life experience and conservative ideas and the deputy director who opposes him..." (April 29, "Neues Deutschland" supplement "Art and Literature").

    杂感
    司马牛
    据读者来信说，安徽省涡阳县的电影放映队和剧团喜欢合作演出，即电影戏剧上下场连演，电影票和戏票合在一起卖，叫“统一票”。观众看了上一场，非连带看下一场不可。当然，观众可以放弃一场自己所不想看的东西。但是，票价已经“统”在一块，放弃就等于牺牲和浪费。于是，观众表示不满。
    创制“统一票”法的人，也许是为了尽量满足人民的文化生活需要，或是加紧群众的思想教育吧？反正是出于高度的热心。但是，你看，办事而采取强制手段，好事也会办坏，那怕是强制人去娱乐。
    也许还不是为了上述目的，那就是另一个问题了。
    我们的国外朋友热烈地称赞我们的话剧，这自然是十分可感的，有不少剧作是好的。但是，当他对我们的一些有公式化、概念化的毛病的作品也曲为优容时，就不能不苦笑了。他说：
    “观众在剧院里甚至对在舞台上所讨论到思想意识、政治和经济等方面的问题的方式，在一定程度上也是同意的……他们欢迎这种情节……他们甚至于对很长的、烦琐的对白，讨论和说服工作，都感到兴趣。对白，讨论和说服工作是……在一个缺乏生活经历、有着保守思想的工程师同反对他的……副厂长之间进行的。”（四月二十九日“新德意志报”副刊“艺术和文学”）。
