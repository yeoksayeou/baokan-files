    Examination
    Liu Qun
    Recently, 30,000 employees and shop assistants from commercial departments such as food, department stores, and cooperatives in Beijing braved the heat and went to the "examination hall" with trepidation. Those who failed the exam would not be promoted.
    The examination hall was decorated solemnly, with slogans plastered on all four walls. After entering the hall, many rules were announced: "Silence! Enter through the front door, exit through the back door; non-staff members are not allowed to enter; guests are not allowed to wander around... Examinees are not allowed to look left or right; no urination or defecation allowed; no..." The chief invigilator held a watch and shouted: "Ten minutes left... five minutes left..."
    The chief "examiners" were mostly cadres from various companies, and the exam questions they came up with were truly "varied and wonderful," a grand sight. In the words of the workers, the content of this "grand exam" was:
    "Politics and economics are all included, firewood, rice, oil, and salt are all covered."
    One worker from the No. 57 Sales Office of the Beijing Retail Company, who has thirty years of meat-cutting experience and is well-known for his meat-cutting skills, was asked a math question by the chief "examiner": "What is seven hundred and ninety-nine multiplied by nine hundred and seventy-seven?"
    "I don't know. I'm a meat cutter. If you ask me about cutting meat..."
    "Fail!"
    The chief "examiner" asked a shop worker: "How many stitches are there on a basketball?"
    "I don't know."
    "How much does a basketball weigh?"
    "I don't know either."
    "Fail!"
    The chief "examiner" then asked a daily necessities salesperson from the No. 3 Department Store of the Department Store Company: "Which province does pork floss come from?"
    The shop assistant thought for a long time, thinking, "Xinjiang has herds of cattle and horses, so it must produce pork floss." So he answered:
    "Xinjiang!"
    "Fail!"
    The shop assistant disagreed with the "examiner's" opinion, leading to a dispute. To obtain an accurate answer, he kept asking until he reached the native produce company. Their reply was: "Pork floss comes from the South, but Beijing also has it."

    考试
    刘群
    最近，北京市食品、百货和合作社等商业部门的三万多职工和店员，冒着炎热战战兢兢地赴“考场”，考试不及格者，就不能升级。
    考场布置得很庄严，四壁贴满标语。进场后又宣布许多纪律：“肃静！前门进，后门出；非工作人员不得入场；来宾入席不得乱串……应试者不准左顾右盼；不准大小便；不准……”。主考人手拿着表在喊：“还有十分……还有五分……。”
    主“考官”多是各公司的干部，出的考试题目真是“五花八门”，洋洋大观。用工人的两句话说，这次“大考”的内容是：
    “政治经济全都有，柴米油盐样样全”。
    北京零售公司五十七分销处一位有三十年切肉经验的工人，切肉的技术很有名。主“考官”向他提出一个数学题目：“七百九十九，乘九百七十七是多少？”
    “不知道。我是切肉的，如果您问我切肉……”
    “不及格！”
    主“考官”问一个店员工人：“一个篮球缝多少针？”
    “不知道。”
    “一个篮球有多重？”
    “也不知道。”
    “不及格！”
    主“考官”又问百货公司第三门市部的一个日用品售货员：“肉松出产在那一省？”
    这位店员想了半天，他想：“新疆牛马成群，一定产肉松。”于是答道：
    “新疆！”
    “不及格！”
    这位店员不同意“考官”的意见，因而发生了争执。为了求得一个准确的答案，一直问到土产公司，他们的答复是：“肉松出在南方，但北京也有。”
