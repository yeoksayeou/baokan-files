    Please Care About Mass Dance Activities
    Long Yinpei
    The "China Youth Daily" and the Beijing Mass Art Museum recently jointly held the "Youth Collective Dance Creation Competition." This activity encouraged the creative enthusiasm of the young masses and produced some excellent works. However, there is a thought-provoking question: very few works by professional dance workers participated in the competition.
    I feel that our professional dance workers, especially some leading comrades in the dance field, do not pay enough attention to and care about mass collective dance activities. As far as I know, some comrades think that collective dance is not art, that collective dance is not a form of our national tradition, and that it has no future; some comrades feel that it is the lowest form of dance and are unwilling to create it; and some comrades think that this is a matter for the masses and has nothing to do with me... Some dance workers who were originally interested in collective dance creation have gradually become alienated from it under the influence of these views.
    Who can say that collective dance is not art? Although it is a relatively simple and popular form of self-entertainment dance, it can not only express the joyful, optimistic, healthy, and lively thoughts, feelings, and spiritual outlook of our young people today, but also serve as a tool for aesthetic education in the emotions, character, and other aspects of young people.
    Who can say that collective dance is not a form of our national tradition? Although it has been influenced by some foreign influences, in fact, most of our folk dances are self-entertaining collective dances, such as Yangko, Flower Lantern, Tiao Yue, and Tiao Lusheng, which are different from the collective dances we are talking about now in terms of form and style, but they play the same role in people's lives. At present, some comrades have used folk dance materials to create collective dances that express the thoughts and feelings of the people today, and are loved by the broad masses. Why say that collective dance is not our national tradition? For several years, collective dance has been circulating and developing among the broad masses, and it has become one of the indispensable cultural and recreational activities among the masses. How can it be said that it has no future?
    Dance workers, dance experts, please pay more attention to the dance activities of the masses!

### 请关心群众的舞蹈活动

    请关心群众的舞蹈活动
    隆荫培
    “中国青年报”和北京群众艺术馆最近联合举办了“青年集体舞创作比赛”。这个活动鼓舞了青年群众的创作热情，出现了一些优秀的作品，但是，却有一个值得令人深思的问题：专业舞蹈工作者参加比赛的作品很少。
    我觉得，我们的专业的舞蹈工作者，特别是舞蹈界的一些领导同志，现在对群众集体舞活动还不够重视、不够关心。就我所知，有的同志认为集体舞不是艺术，集体舞不是我们民族传统的形式，没有发展前途；有些同志觉得它是舞蹈中最低级的形式，不愿意去创作它；也有的同志则认为这是群众的事，与我无关…………。有些本来对集体舞创作有兴趣的舞蹈工作者，受了上面这些看法的影响，现在也对它逐渐地疏远起来了。
    谁能说集体舞不是艺术？它虽然是比较简单通俗的一种自娱性的舞蹈，但是它不仅能够表达今天我们青少年的欢欣鼓舞、乐观向上、健康活泼的思想感情和精神面貌，同时也是对青少年的情感、性格等方面进行美学教育的一种工具。
    谁能说集体舞不是我们民族传统的形式？它虽然受到了一些外来的影响；但是事实上，我们的民间舞蹈大多都是自娱性的集体舞蹈，如秧歌、花灯、跳乐、跳籚笙等都是，只不过与现在所谈的集体舞在形式和风格上有所不同，而它们在人民生活中所起的作用却没有什么两样。目前，有些同志已经运用了民间舞蹈的素材进行集体舞的创作，表达了今天人民的思想感情，被广大群众所热爱。为什么说集体舞不是我们民族的传统呢？几年来集体舞一直在广大群众中流传着、发展着，它在群众中已经成为不可缺少的文娱活动之一了。怎么能说它没有发展前途呢？
    舞蹈工作者们，舞蹈专家们，请多关心群众的舞蹈活动吧！
