Neixiang County Earnestly Revises Production Increase Targets
Farmers' Enthusiasm for Production Increases, Striving to Achieve the Annual Production Plan

(Reported by this newspaper) The revision of excessively high production increase plans in Neixiang County, Henan Province, has greatly promoted production. This spring, the Neixiang County Party Committee initially set a target of increasing the average yield per mu of grain for the wheat and autumn harvests to 1,000 jin. Later, according to instructions from the prefectural committee, this was changed to 700 jin per mu for the entire county. This year, nearly 500,000 mu of wheat in the county achieved a general bumper harvest, with an average yield of approximately 220 jin per mu, an increase of more than 40% compared to last year, marking a rare major increase in Neixiang County's history. Despite such a substantial increase, it still fell short of the original planned target of 350 jin per mu for wheat. Consequently, the overall grain yield target of 700 jin per mu for the entire county warranted reconsideration.

After in-depth investigation and research, the Neixiang County Party Committee also discovered that among the county's 77 townships, 21 were mountainous, with approximately 110,000 mu of sloping land. These lands can only grow one crop of autumn grain per year, but when the county committee formulated the county's production increase targets in the spring, the output of these lands was calculated based on two seasons of output.

To ensure that the plan was practical and avoided pursuing unattainable goals, the Neixiang County Party Committee, after careful study and repeated deliberation and discussion through village cadres leading the masses, finally decided to revise the county's target for increasing the yield of grain for the wheat and autumn harvests from 700 jin per mu to 550 jin per mu, striving to achieve 700 jin.

After the excessively high production increase plan in Neixiang County was revised, the confidence and enthusiasm of the vast rural cadres and masses to guarantee increased production were greatly enhanced. The entire county is now actively carrying out production labor competitions, striving to better complete the annual production increase plan.

### 内乡县切实修订增产指标  农民生产积极性提高努力实现全年生产计划

    内乡县切实修订增产指标
    农民生产积极性提高努力实现全年生产计划
    本报讯　河南省内乡县修订过高的增产计划对生产发生很大推动作用。中共内乡县委，今春曾确定全县麦秋两季平均亩产千斤粮食的增产指标；以后根据地委指示，又改为全县亩产粮食700斤。今年全县近五十万亩小麦普遍丰收，每亩平均产量约220斤，比去年增产四成多，这是内乡县历史上少见的大增产。虽然增产这样多，仍达不到小麦亩产350斤的原计划指标。这样，全县粮食亩产700斤的指标就很值得考虑了。
    中共内乡县委经过深入的调查研究，又发现全县77个乡中有21个山区乡，共有山坡地约十一万亩。这些地每年只能种一季秋粮，但县委在春天制定全县增产指标的时候，也把这些地的产量按两季产量计算了。
    为了使计划切合实际，不去硬作那种作不到的事情，中共内乡县委经过仔细研究，又通过乡村干部领导群众反复酝酿讨论，最后决定修改全县麦秋两季亩产粮食700斤的增产指标为亩产550斤，力争实现700斤。
    内乡县偏高的增产计划修改后，广大农村干部和群众保证增产的信心和热情大大提高了。现在全县正积极开展生产劳动竞赛，为更好地完成全年增产计划而努力。
