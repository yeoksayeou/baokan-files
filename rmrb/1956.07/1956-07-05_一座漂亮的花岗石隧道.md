Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, 3rd. On the Yingtan-Xiamen railway line, there is a beautiful tunnel built of granite. After technical appraisal, the project quality fully meets the standards.

    Around this tunnel, there are many stone mountains rich in granite. A certain unit of the Railway Corps broke with convention and used granite with a strength of grade ten or higher, replacing the cement lining of the tunnel arches and side walls. This saved more than 700 tons of cement, and the cost was also lower than using cement.

    一座漂亮的花岗石隧道
    新华社福州3日电　在鹰厦铁路线上，有一座用花岗石砌成的漂亮的隧道。经过技术鉴定，工程质量完全合乎标准。
    在这个隧道的周围，有很多盛产花岗石的石山，铁道兵某部打破了陈规，就地取材，全部采用强度在十级以上的花岗石，代替水泥衬砌隧道拱圈和边墙，因而节省了七百多吨水泥，成本也比用水泥低。
