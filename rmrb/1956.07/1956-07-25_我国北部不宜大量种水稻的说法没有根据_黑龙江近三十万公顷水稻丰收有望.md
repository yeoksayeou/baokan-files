Xinhua News Agency dispatch by Xinhua News Agency reporter Shao Yongli: The more than 294,000 hectares of rice planted in Heilongjiang Province, the northernmost part of China, are generally growing well, with robust seedlings, and a bumper harvest is expected.

This year, Heilongjiang Province has newly added 120,000 hectares of rice fields, a figure equivalent to the total area of paddy fields developed in the thirty years before liberation.

Last winter and this spring, with the realization of advanced agricultural cooperativization throughout the province, farmers universally responded to the government's call to expand rice planting. They braved the severe cold in winter to build more than 3,000 small-scale water conservancy projects. Now, along many rivers and lakes, newly built canals divert river water to the paddy fields. Low-lying areas that were abandoned in previous years due to flooding are now growing lush rice seedlings. Agricultural production cooperatives in Zhaozhou, Zhaoyuan, and other counties have used alkali washing methods to transform alkaline land that could not grow crops in the past into paddy fields. F锦 county, which has never grown rice in its history, also planted 2,700 hectares of rice this year. Even the Heihe area, located between 50 and 53 degrees north latitude, has planted 2,000 hectares of rice.

Vigorously developing paddy fields brings great benefits to both farmers and the country. According to a survey in Wuchang County, the county can increase grain production by 40,000 tons this year by expanding rice planting. Agricultural production cooperatives that plant rice can increase their income by about 200 yuan per household on average.

The new achievements in rice development in Heilongjiang Province this year prove that the assertion that northern China is not suitable for large-scale rice development is unfounded. This province, located in the northernmost part of China, has superior conditions for developing rice. Most of the province has flat terrain and fertile soil. The famous "Five Rivers and Two Lakes" - the Heilongjiang River, the Songhua River, the Ussuri River, the Nen River, the Mudan River, and Xingkai Lake and Jingpo Lake, as well as more than 1,700 rivers of all sizes, have exceptionally abundant water sources. Although the winters here are long and cold, there are still 100 to 130 frost-free days each year, and the summer has sufficient sunshine, which can guarantee the growth of rice. The cold-resistant and early-maturing rice varieties such as "Ishikari Hakumou," "Guoguang," and "Mirong," cultivated by agricultural departments and agricultural scientists, and the advanced cultivation methods of successful dry direct seeding, enable the rice to mature in about 100 days after sowing. Therefore, in recent years, with the development of agricultural cooperativization, not only has the rice planting area expanded rapidly, but also the rice yield has also increased significantly. In 1955, the average yield per hectare of the province's more than 170,000 hectares of rice reached 6,482 jin, more than twice the yield of general dryland grain crops. According to its economic value, one hectare of rice is almost equivalent to three hectares of coarse grains.

The leading organs of Heilongjiang Province have made increasing rice planting one of the main measures for increasing production. The preliminary plan is to increase the province's rice area by 150,000 to 200,000 hectares next year.

### 我国北部不宜大量种水稻的说法没有根据  黑龙江近三十万公顷水稻丰收有望

    我国北部不宜大量种水稻的说法没有根据
    黑龙江近三十万公顷水稻丰收有望
    据新华社讯　新华社记者邵永力报道：我国最北部的黑龙江省今年种植的二十九万四千多公顷水稻，普遍生育良好，秧棵茁壮，丰收有望。
    今年，黑龙江省新增加的水稻面积达十二万公顷，这个数字相当于解放前三十年中所开发的稻田面积的总和。
    去冬今春随着全省高级农业合作化的实现，农民普遍响应政府扩大种植水稻的号召，他们在冬季里冒着严寒修建了三千多处小型水利工程。现在，许多河流、湖泊的两旁，都是新修起的一道道的水渠，把河水源源引向稻田。往年因受涝而撩荒的洼地，如今也生长着油绿的稻秧。肇州、肇源等县农业生产合作社用洗碱的办法把过去不能生长庄稼的碱地，改造成稻田。历史上从来未种过水稻的富锦县，今年也种了二千七百公顷水稻。连位于北纬五十度到五十三度的黑河专区，也种植了二千公顷水稻。
    大力发展水田，给农民和国家都带来很大的利益。据五常县的调查，全县今年因扩大种植水稻可增产四万吨粮食，种植水稻的农业生产合作社，平均每户可以增加收入二百元左右。
    黑龙江省今年发展水稻的新成就证明：那种说我国北方不适宜大量发展水稻的说法是没有根据的。位于我国最北部的这个省分，有着发展水稻的优越条件。全省大部地区地势平坦，土壤肥沃，著名的“五江二湖”——黑龙江、松花江、乌苏里江、嫩江、牡丹江和兴凯湖、镜泊湖，以及一千七百多条大小河流，有着异常丰富的水源，这里虽然冬季较长和寒冷，但每年仍有一百天到一百三十天的无霜期，而且夏季日照量充足，可以保证水稻的成长。农业部门和农业科学工作者培育的“石狩白毛”、“国光”、“弥荣”等耐寒、早熟的水稻品种，和已经成功的旱直播的先进耕作方法，更使水稻在下种后一百天左右即可成熟。因而近几年来，随着农业合作化的发展，不仅水稻播种面迅速扩大，水稻产量也有了显著提高。1955年全省十七万多公顷水稻，平均每公顷产量达到了六千四百八十二斤。比一般旱田粮谷作物产量高一倍以上，按其经济价值计算，一公顷水稻几乎等于三公顷杂粮。
    黑龙江省的领导机关已把增植水稻做为主要增产措施之一。初步计划明年全省水稻面积将增加十五万到二十万公顷。
