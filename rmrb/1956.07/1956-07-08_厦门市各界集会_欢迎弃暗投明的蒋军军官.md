Xinhua News Agency, Fujian Front, July 7th. "I am Chinese, and I am unwilling to live under the enslavement of the Americans any longer. Therefore, I risked swimming back. Today, all military and political affairs of Chiang Kai-shek's army must be approved by the Americans before they can be implemented." This is what Nie Zhiwei, deputy company commander of the heavy weapons company of the Chiang army, who swam across the sea from Dadan Island, said at a welcome rally in Xiamen City on the evening of the 3rd. Cai Yanji, Deputy Mayor of Xiamen City, said at the welcome meeting that Nie Zhiwei's patriotic act of abandoning the darkness for the light was welcomed and once again pointed out a bright path for Kuomintang military and political personnel who had fled to Taiwan and the coastal islands awaiting liberation. Cai Yanji said that if Kuomintang military and political personnel come to Xiamen City through peaceful means, the government will provide proper care.
    Lin Shuqin, a 67-year-old woman, has a son serving in the Chiang army navy. She said at the meeting that she hoped her son would return as soon as possible like Nie Zhiwei. She said, "Mothers on the mainland who have sons in Taiwan are all looking forward to the reunion with their own children."

    厦门市各界集会
    欢迎弃暗投明的蒋军军官
    新华社福建前线7日电　“我是中国人，我不甘心再在美国人的奴役下生活，因此冒险泅水归来。今天，蒋介石军队的一切军政事务，都得美国人批准才能实施。”这是从大担岛泅水渡海归来的蒋军重兵器连副连长聂智威三日晚间在厦门市一个欢迎集会上说的话。厦门市副市长蔡衍吉在欢迎会上说，聂智威弃暗投明的爱国行动受到欢迎，又一次给逃跑到台湾和沿海待解放岛屿的国民党军政人员指出了一条光明的道路。蔡衍吉说，国民党军政人员如果通过和平道路来到厦门市，政府都会给予妥善的照顾。
    六十七岁的老太太林淑琴有儿子在蒋军海军当兵。她在会上说，她希望她儿子和聂智威一样早日归来。她说：“有儿子在台湾的大陆上的母亲，都在盼望着自己的亲骨肉回来团聚。”
