Xinhua News Agency, July 29th, Lille - French Foreign Minister Bidault stated yesterday at the Socialist Party congress held in Lille that the main effort of French foreign policy should be to strive to "eliminate the Cold War." He emphasized that East-West contacts should be expanded.

In a foreign policy report submitted to the congress, Bidault pointed out the significant impact of Soviet foreign policy on the overall international situation, saying that previous French governments had failed to appreciate this situation. He analyzed the recent Franco-Soviet negotiations in Moscow in considerable detail.

Bidault expressed his approval for establishing direct contacts between countries' representatives. Bidault pointed out that France's alliance with Western countries "does not prevent us from establishing ties with other countries." He said, "We have not abandoned our alliance, but our loyalty to the alliance should not be excessive." He added that France should not stand idly by as world events unfold, and that seeking solutions to various international problems is the task of French foreign policy.

Bidault spoke about the situation in Asia, the Far East, the Near East, and North Africa. He advocated establishing trade relations with the People's Republic of China and expanding contacts with India.

In explaining his position on domestic policy, Bidault opposed the establishment of a People's Front in France.

    比诺强调法国要致力消除冷战
    并说对同盟的忠诚不应过份
    新华社29日讯　里尔消息：法国外交部长比诺昨天在他的社会党在里尔举行的代表大会上说，法国外交的主要努力应该是争取“消除冷战”。他强调应当扩大东西方之间的接触。
    比诺在向大会提出的外交政策报告中指出，苏联外交政策对整个国际局势的重大影响，他说，以前历届法国政府没有估计到这种情况。他相当详尽地分析了不久以前在莫斯科举行的法苏谈判。
    比诺表示赞同各国代表建立直接的接触。比诺指出，法国同西方国家的同盟关系“并不阻止我们同其他国家建立联系”。他说，我们没有放弃我们的同盟，不过我们对同盟的忠诚不应该带有过份的性质。他又说，法国不应该袖手旁观世界事态的发展，寻求解决各种国际问题是法国外交政策的任务。
    比诺谈到亚洲、远东、近东和北非的局势。他主张同中华人民共和国建立贸易关系以及同印度扩大联系。
    比诺在解释他在国内政策方面的立场的时候反对在法国建立人民阵线。
