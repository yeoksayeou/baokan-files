    Deep-Sea Observation Chamber
    A new underwater operation device, a deep-sea observation chamber, has recently been manufactured in Shanghai. It will soon be transported to coastal salvage sites, where engineering technicians can sit inside it and sink to the seabed to observe the damage to sunken ships, the thickness of silt, and to direct divers in salvaging the ships.

    The deep-sea observation chamber is shaped like a tower, more than two meters high. Inside, it is equipped with oxygen cylinders, a carbon dioxide absorber, and instruments for measuring water depth and pressure. The technicians inside can observe their surroundings, draw diagrams, and photograph the sunken ships through twelve windows embedded with special glass. The chamber also has a telephone for constant communication with the surface. The observation chamber is made of T-shaped iron and iron plates with high compressive strength, so it will not deform even in water 100 meters deep.

    High-Altitude Meteorological Balloon
    A large meteorological balloon for high-altitude weather detection has been successfully trial-produced by the newly built state-owned No. 11 Rubber Factory in Guangzhou. This balloon can ascend to altitudes of over sixteen kilometers to detect weather conditions. The balloon has good physical properties, a uniform membrane thickness with no air bubbles, and will not leak air after being filled and left for two days. It also has extreme elasticity. When air is compressed into the balloon, its diameter can increase from one meter to over five meters, making its quality even better than some imported products.

    Winter Cotton Rain Boots
    A type of cotton rain boot for winter wear has been successfully trial-produced in Tianjin. Its appearance is the same as ordinary rain boots, but it has a layer of soft camel hair inside.

    The Tianjin First Light Industry Bureau's Rubber Shoe Research Group, which trial-produced the cotton rain boots, has also trial-produced thirteen types of cotton shoes with rubber soles and cloth (or woolen) uppers for men, women, and children, based on consumer demand. One type of high-top children's cotton shoe with ladder buckles can be tightened or loosened according to the width of the child's foot and the thickness of the instep. (Xinhua News Agency)

    新产品
    深水观察箱
    一种新的水下作业设备——深水观察箱，最近在上海制造出来。不久以后，它将运往沿海打捞工地，供工程技术人员坐在里面，沉入海底观察沉船破损、淤泥厚度等情况，和指挥潜水员们打捞沉船。
    深水观察箱是塔形的，有二公尺多高，里面装着氧气瓶、吸收二氧化炭的消毒器以及测定水深和气压的仪表。坐在里面的技术人员，可以通过十二个嵌着特种玻璃的窗口，向周围观察、绘图和对着沉船摄影。箱里还有电话，能随时和水面上联络。观察箱是用抗压能力很强的丁字铁和铁板制成的，在一百公尺的深水中也不会变形。
    探测高空气象的气球
    一种探测高空气象用的大气球在广州市新建的国营第十一橡胶厂试制成功。这种大气球能升上十六公里以上的高空探测气候。气球的物理性能良好，球膜厚薄均匀，没有气泡，装满空气停放两天不会漏气；而且弹性极强。用空气压缩机把空气压进气球，使气球膨胀以后，直径可由原来的一公尺增加到五公尺以上，质量比一些进口货还好。
    冬季穿的棉雨鞋
    一种冬季穿的棉雨鞋，已经在天津市试制成功，它的外形和普通雨鞋一样，但是里面有一层柔软的驼绒。
    试制棉雨鞋的天津市第一轻工业局胶鞋研究组，还根据消费者的要求试制了十三种男、女、儿童穿用的胶底布面（或呢面）棉鞋。有一种有梯扣的高腰童棉鞋，可以按照儿童脚面宽狭和脚背厚薄随意松紧。　（据新华社讯）
