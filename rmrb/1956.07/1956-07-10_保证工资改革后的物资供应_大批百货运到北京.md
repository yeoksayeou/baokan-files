    Guaranteeing Supply of Goods After Wage Reform
    Large Quantities of Merchandise Arrive in Beijing

    (Our Newspaper) Beijing – To ensure the supply of goods following the wage reform, the Beijing Department Store Company organized a commodity purchasing team, which went to Tianjin, Shanghai, Nanjing, Xi'an, Guangzhou, and other places in early June to purchase daily-use merchandise.

    Within a month, the purchasing team acquired various clothing items, leather shoes, towels, rubber shoes, bedsheets, and small daily-use merchandise, worth more than 4.5 million yuan. These goods have been successively transported to Beijing and directly distributed to various retail outlets for sale. According to preliminary statistics from the Municipal Department Store Company, just four retail outlets added more than 4,100 varieties of goods in June. The Wangfujing Department Store added approximately 1,000 new varieties of toys, porcelain, food, and daily-use handicrafts. These included well-known Shantou silk handkerchiefs and tablecloths, Guangzhou rattan pillows, Hangzhou silk fans, and other exquisite handicrafts. The famous state-private joint venture Shengxifu Hat Shop also specially hired technicians from Shanghai to manufacture seventy varieties of men's, women's, and children's straw hats.
