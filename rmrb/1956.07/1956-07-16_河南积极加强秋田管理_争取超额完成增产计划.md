Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, July 14th: Agricultural production cooperatives in various parts of Henan Province are actively strengthening the management of autumn fields, striving to complete and overfulfill the production increase plan in the autumn production.

Currently, more than 20,000 agricultural production cooperatives across the province are thinning seedlings, weeding, and applying fertilizer to more than 80 million mu of summer-sown crops. Mi County widely promotes seedling thinning using rulers in all townships. In the new corn areas of Shangqiu and Kaifeng, people are actively learning corn management techniques to improve autumn management. After learning seedling thinning techniques, many agricultural cooperatives have changed their original plans of blindly retaining more than 4,000 seedlings per mu to more than 2,000 seedlings, thus reducing empty corn stalks. Some areas where wheat production was reduced due to waterlogging have put forward the slogan "Lose in summer, recover in autumn, lose there, recover there" and "Plant again after flooding." Ye County has 290,000 mu of autumn fields. After the flooding, the agricultural cooperative members promptly drained the water and planted a second time. Agricultural cooperatives in Shangqiu Prefecture are applying fertilizer to the newly planted autumn fields. Huaiyang County had accumulated more than 570,000 cartloads of fertilizer by July 4th, with nearly two cartloads of fertilizer applied to each mu of autumn field.

In areas where wheat production increased this year, the income of agricultural cooperative members increased compared to last year during the summer distribution, and the members' enthusiasm for production has greatly increased. The labor attendance rate in many agricultural cooperatives has increased compared to before. The attendance rate of agricultural cooperatives in Xinye County is above 90% every day. From July 4th to July 10th, weeds have been cleared from all autumn fields in the county. Anyang County's wheat production increased by 30% this year compared to last year, and the entire county is launching an even more enthusiastic production increase competition.

    河南积极加强秋田管理
    争取超额完成增产计划
    新华社郑州14日电　河南省各地农业生产合作社正积极加强秋田管理，力争在秋季生产中完成和超额完成增产计划。
    现在，全省两万多个农业生产合作社正在八千多万亩的夏播作物中进行定苗、锄草和追肥。密县各乡普遍推行了尺子定苗。商丘、开封等玉米新区里，正积极学习玉米管理技术，做好秋季管理。许多农业社在学习了定苗技术后，原先盲目留苗四千株以上的计划都已改为二千多株，这样，玉米就减少了空棵。部分因雨积水小麦减产的地区提出“夏季丢，秋季捞，在那里丢，在那里捞”“淹了再种”的口号。叶县有二十九万亩秋田，在淹了以后，农业社员们及时排出积水，种上了第二遍。商丘专区农业社在刚抢种上的秋田里追肥。淮阳县到七月四日已积肥五十七万多车，每亩秋田都已有近两车追肥了。
    今年小麦获得增产的地区，农业社员们在夏季分配中收入比去年增加了，社员们生产积极性高涨。许多农业社的劳动出勤率比前增加。新野县各农业社出勤率每天都在90％以上。在七月四日至十日的七天中，已经把全县秋田中的杂草除净了。安阳县今年小麦比去年增产三成，全县正在开展更加高涨的增产竞赛。
