Xinhua News Agency, 18th. Cotton in the double-cropping cotton region of the South, which was transplanted from seedlings, has now begun to boll. It is estimated that the cotton that was bred earlier will begin to fluff and start picking flowers in late July, more than a month earlier than the cotton that is sown directly after the summer harvest.

This year, Sichuan, Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Hubei, Anhui, Jiangxi and other provinces have promoted or expanded the experience of increasing production by transplanting cotton seedlings in squares in Sichuan Province and transplanting seedlings in nutritious pots by the East China Academy of Agricultural Sciences. According to preliminary statistics, more than one million mu of cotton seedlings have been transplanted. Farmers in various regions have adopted the method of batch seedling raising according to the different harvesting periods of various summer crops, and planted 20 to 30 days earlier than the cotton directly sown after the summer crops were harvested. The cotton seedlings have been carefully managed during cultivation, so they grow neatly and healthily after transplanting. These cotton plants have more fruit branches, and the periods of budding, flowering, and boll formation are all advanced, which will enable early maturity and high yield.

    南方育苗移栽的棉花将提早一个多月摘花
    新华社18日讯　南方两熟制棉区育苗移栽的棉花，目前已开始结铃。育苗较早的棉花，估计在七月下旬就将吐絮，开始摘花，比在夏熟作物收获后直接播种的棉花提早一个多月摘花。
    今年四川、浙江、江苏、湖北、安徽、江西等省都推广了或扩大了四川省的棉花方格育苗移栽和华东农业科学研究所的营养钵育苗移栽的增产经验。初步统计，育苗移栽的棉花共一百多万亩。各地农民都根据各种夏熟作物的不同收获期，采取分批育苗的办法，比夏熟作物收获后直接播种的棉花提前了二十到三十天播种。棉苗在培育中得到精细的管理，因此移栽后生长整齐健壮。这些棉花的果枝长得多，结蕾、开花、结铃的时期都提早，将能早熟丰产。
