A young Communist Youth League member who serves as a clerk in the Tianjin Maritime Transportation Court wrote in his diary: "Youth fades quickly, the sun and moon revolve, and the passage of time ages people." These words from the mouth of a young Communist Youth League member are indeed strange, but they are also due to a reason, and that reason is none other than "having nothing to do." Not to mention the distant past, but looking at the situation from January to June 21st this year, the entire court received a total of twenty-one cases. On average, each judge and each clerk handles less than one case per month, and the trial of a case usually only takes about a day and a half. So, how do people spend the long working day? Like the aforementioned young League member, he spends all day flipping through the files page by page, then flipping them back page by page, then checking them up, down, left, and right, to see if they are neatly bound. Then he picks up his pen, sighs deeply, and continues to organize his file, which has already been "decorated" a thousand times. Others just look at the wall clock, check their watches, and simply wait for the end of the working day.

As the saying goes, "Every inch of time is worth an inch of gold." Now is a period of high tide, and every inch of time is worth more than an inch of gold. But why do the relevant leaders in Tianjin allow the staff of the Tianjin Maritime Transportation Court to waste their time like this?

    书记员的苦恼
    担任天津市水上运输法院书记员的一个青年团员在日记上写道：“青春迅逝，日月轮转，岁月更替摧人残”。这几句话出自青年团员之口，确实可怪，可是，却也事出有因，这个因不是别的，而是“无事可干”。远的不说，就拿今年一月到六月二十一日的情况看，全院总共收了二十一件案子，平均起来，一个审判员和一个书记员一个月还处理不到一件案子，而审理一件案子，通常也只要一天半左右，那么，人们如何度过漫长的工作日呢？也就是前面说的那个青年团员，他整天把卷宗一页一页地翻过去，又一页一页地翻过来，再上下左右，挨次检查检查，看看装订得是不是整齐，然后拿起笔来，长叹一声，继续整理他那本已经“修饰”了千百次的卷宗，还有人就望望挂钟，看看手表，干脆等待下班。
    谚语云：“一寸光阴一寸金，”目下是高潮时期，一寸光阴何止一寸金，可是天津市有关领导方面为什么让天津水上运输法院的工作人员这样来虚度光阴？
