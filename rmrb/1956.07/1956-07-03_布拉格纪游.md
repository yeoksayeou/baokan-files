A Trip to Prague
Zhang Pei

Starting from 1230, when the Czech dynasty established the first royal city in Prague, Prague has had more than seven hundred years of history. In every street and alley of the old city, you can find buildings of various styles dating back to the 13th century. Standing on the hillside of the Presidential Palace, overlooking Prague, the first thing that catches your eye are the quaint Romanesque and Gothic church spires, as well as the exquisite gardens of the aristocratic residences. The Vltava River has many bridges, the oldest of which was built in the 14th century during the reign of Charles IV. Artistically speaking, this bridge is still the most beautiful one to date. Some secluded alleys in the old city still preserve their ancient forms from centuries ago, and many houses have religious frescoes that are well preserved. The streetlights in some small streets and alleys are hundreds of years old. Like Beijing, some alleys are so narrow that cars and trams are only allowed to pass in one direction. To date, in addition to those large ancient buildings used for churches and offices, there are still thirty-six residences built in the 12th and 13th centuries that continue to be used.

But in Prague, you will never feel dull because it is an ancient city; on the contrary, it gives you a fresh feeling everywhere.

In addition to the twenty-odd streetcar lines, Prague also has many trolleybus and bus lines. During the day, a streetcar comes by in less than a minute, making it very convenient to travel. Recently, a new type of red streetcar with leather sofa seats, similar to a bus, has appeared on the streets of Prague, with a speed of up to 80 kilometers per hour. Prague's public transportation fares are really cheap; for sixty "hellers" (each crown equals one hundred "hellers"), you can travel twenty-three kilometers, and one ticket can be used for three modes of transportation (streetcar, trolleybus, bus).

Prague is a city nestled on small mountains and hills. Cars often have to climb the mountains, so to facilitate traffic in the city, a wide tunnel for cars was recently carved out in the mountains. Normally, pedestrians are not allowed to pass through here, but during grand festivals, cars are not allowed to pass, only allowing marching crowds to pass.

In contrast to the ancient gas streetlights from a hundred years ago, modern fluorescent streetlights are used on some streets.

Along the hillside of the Presidential Palace, there are many former aristocratic gardens. These gardens are built against the mountains and planted with various flowers and trees. In the past, they were enjoyed by only a few members of the aristocratic families, but now they have been repaired by the government and opened to the working people. The Municipal People's Committee is planning to connect all these aristocratic gardens into a park belt.

Taking a walk on the streets or in the alleys of Prague is a very interesting thing. Before four o'clock in the afternoon, there are few pedestrians; after four o'clock, almost everyone is off work, and there are many people on the streets, but it does not give you a feeling of noise. People walk quietly, talking softly, and mothers push strollers to rest in the street parks. Here, there are so many of these strollers; I have never seen a mother carrying a child walking, even in the countryside. These strollers are made very exquisitely. After a mother gives birth to a child, she can receive a special subsidy of one thousand crowns from the government, while purchasing this stroller only requires four hundred crowns. From this, we can also see the government's concern for the second generation.

If you walk along the small alleys of the old city near the Presidential Palace, you can see some small taverns from the 15th century. These small taverns were often frequented by famous poets, musicians, and scholars of the time. Now, these small taverns have also been declared national monuments, and everything is furnished as it was originally, still receiving guests. On the walls next to those unpainted wooden tables, you can sometimes see a few lines of text: "The great poet of the ×× century, ×××, often drank here."

Contrary to our situation, Sundays in Prague are the calmest. Most of the shops are closed, there are few people on the streets, and many people leave the city to go to the suburbs. Along the river valleys on both sides of the Vltava River, there are many tourists. Some are hunting, some are boating, some are sunbathing on the grass, and some are resting in their own small houses in the forest.

Prague has many large hotels, but more common are "automatic cafeterias." These so-called automatic cafeterias are designed to save people's time and allow them to buy milk, coffee, sandwiches, and set meals at any time, so they can eat a meal in a few minutes. These cafeterias do not have seats, and people eat standing up. But the order is very good, and everyone politely buys food in order. It is very quiet, without noisy sounds.

The goods in Prague's shops are very plentiful, and the windows are filled with all kinds of merchandise. There are large department stores, as well as smaller specialty stores. What attracts our attention the most are those plastic and artificial fiber products, and there are also many things made of fiberglass. Shirts, socks, raincoats, handbags, tablecloths—dozens of these kinds of products can be counted. They are cheaper than ordinary cotton and woolen fabrics, and they are also very strong and beautiful. In particular, they are easy to wash; just rinse them in water and they are clean. Comrades from the New Technology Department of the State Planning Commission told us: Adding a little fiberglass to general clothing materials can make them three times stronger; if three million sets of work clothes are made, 7.5 million meters of fabric and 1,500 textile workers can be saved. In the second Five-Year Plan, these types of chemical products will be increased threefold.

People in Prague are very particular about the style of their clothes, but they are very simple when working. Many people wear cloth clothes. The khaki raincoats that we wear domestically are worn by men and women in Prague as casual clothes in spring and autumn. However, when they get off work and go home, when they attend parties or festivals, everyone dresses up. At this time, it is difficult to tell the difference between an ordinary cafeteria server and a government minister from their clothes.

Prague is a city with ancient cultural and artistic traditions, a quiet city with a comfortable and convenient life, but more importantly, it is also a city of production, a large industrial center, and it undertakes important tasks in socialist construction. Among Prague's nine hundred thousand residents, three hundred thousand are industrial workers.

If you walk further west or east from the city center, you can no longer hear the bells from the ancient clock tower on the Old Town Square. Here, you hear the sounds of various machines, and tens of thousands of people are diligently producing socialist wealth. Near these factories, buildings of workers' dormitories are being constructed, mostly new-style buildings of six to eight stories.

In the factories of Prague, we saw a very meaningful thing, which is that many enterprises regard helping agricultural cooperatives as their due responsibility. In front of the office building of the famous Stalingrad Factory, there is a wooden map. This is a map of a district in the Prague region, and the Stalingrad Factory is responsible for helping the agricultural cooperatives in this district. The map marks the locations of each cooperative. The factory organizes workers to help the cooperatives with voluntary labor, and uses waste materials and saved materials to manufacture agricultural tools and send them to the cooperatives.

May in Prague is the most beautiful season. The entire city is covered in greenery, and the city becomes more and more beautiful every day. But the people of Prague are not just seeking quiet. The grand prospects of the new Five-Year Plan are becoming the center of people's discussions, and the enthusiasm of patriotism is stirring people's hearts. The people of Prague understand that Prague, this famous European city at the western end of the socialist camp, is at the forefront of the peaceful competition with the Western capitalist world. Whether it is the workers of the Stalingrad Factory or the shop assistants of the White Swan Department Store, they all know that they shoulder a great responsibility. (Attached pictures)

    布拉格纪游
    张沛
    从1230年捷克王朝在布拉格建立第一个王城算起，布拉格已经有了七百多年的历史。你在老城区的每一条街道，每一个胡同，差不多都可以找到十三世纪以来各种形式的建筑物。站在总统府的山坡上，俯瞰布拉格，首先映入眼帘的是一些古色古香的罗马式、歌德式的教堂尖塔，以及贵族住宅的精致花园。弗尔塔瓦河有许多座桥，其中最老的一座是十四世纪查理第四时代造的，从艺术性上说，这座桥到现在为止，还是最美丽的一座桥。老城区的一些僻静的胡同，还保存着几个世纪以前的古老形式，许多房屋里带有宗教色彩的壁画被保存得很好。一些小街和胡同里的路灯，已经有了几百年的历史。和北京一样，有些胡同因为过于狭窄，只许一个方向单行通过汽车和电车。到目前为止，除了那些教堂和机关办公用的一些大的古建筑以外，还有三十六所十二、十三世纪建造的住宅继续被使用着。
    但是你在布拉格绝不会因为这是一个古老的城市而感觉沉闷，相反，它处处给你以新鲜的感觉。
    布拉格除了二十几路有轨电车以外，还有好多路无轨电车和公共汽车，白天用不了一分钟就会有一辆电车开过来，行路非常方便。最近布拉格街头出现了一种红色的有皮沙发坐位类似公共汽车的新式电车，这种电车的速度每小时达到八十公里。布拉格的公共交通的票价实在便宜，花六十个“海来”（每个克朗等于一百个“海来”）可以乘车二十三公里，一张票可以换乘三种交通工具（电车、无轨电车、公共汽车）。
    布拉格是一个躺在小山和丘陵上的城市，汽车常常要盘山而上，为了便利市区的交通，不久以前在山中凿开了一条通行汽车的宽大隧道，平常这里行人不许通行，但到了盛大的节日，汽车就不能通过了，只让游行的群众来往。
    和一百年以前的古老的煤气路灯相对照的，在一些街道上采用了近代的日光路灯。
    沿着总统府山坡，有许多过去的贵族花园，这些花园倚山建筑，栽着各种花树，过去只是贵族一家少数人享受，现在经过政府修理，为劳动人民开放了。市人民委员会正计划把所有这些贵族花园联成一片，形成一个公园带。
    在布拉格的大街上或者胡同里散步，是一件很有兴味的事。下午四点钟以前，行人很少，四点钟以后，差不多所有的人都下班了，街上的人很多，但是并不给人一种喧嚣的感觉，人们安静地走着，轻声的谈话，母亲们推着小车在街头公园休息。在这里，这种婴儿车多极了，从来没有看见妈妈抱着孩子走路的，在乡村中也是如此。这种婴儿车制造得很精美。母亲每生一个孩子以后，就可以向政府领到一千克朗的特别补助金，而购置这种小车只需要四百个克朗，从这里也可以看出政府对第二代的关心了。
    如果你在老城区靠近总统府的小胡同走一走，就可以看到有一些十五世纪的小酒店，这些小酒店是当时著名的诗人、音乐家、学者常常光顾的地方。现在这些小酒店也被宣布为国家古迹，一切都按原来的样子陈设着，照样地接待客人。在那些没有油漆过的木头桌子旁边的墙壁上，有时你可以看到几行字：“××世纪的伟大诗人×××常在此处喝酒”。
    和我们的情形相反，布拉格的星期天是最冷静的，绝大部分商店都休息了，街上人很少，许多人都离开城市到郊外去了，沿着弗尔塔瓦河两岸的河谷，尽是游人。有的打猎，有的划船，有的在草地上晒太阳，有的在森林中自己的小房子中休息。
    布拉格有许多大饭店，但更普遍的是一种“自动食堂”，所谓自动食堂，就是为了节省人们的时间，可以随时买到牛奶、咖啡、夹肉面包和份菜，可以在几分钟以内吃一顿饭。这种食堂没有坐位，人们都站着吃饭。但秩序很好，大家都有礼貌地按先后买饭。很安静，没有吵闹的声音。
    布拉格商店的货物非常充足，橱窗内摆满了各种各样的商品，有很大的百货公司，也有较小的专门商店，最引起我们注目的是那些塑料和人造纤维的制品，用玻璃丝做的东西也不少。衬衣、袜子、雨衣、提包、桌布可以数出几十种这类产品，它们比普通的棉织品和毛织品都便宜，而又很结实、漂亮。特别是洗起来方便，只要放在水里涮一下就干净了。国家计划委员会新技术部的同志告诉我们：一般的衣料加一点玻璃丝进去，可以结实三倍；如果作三百万套工作服，即可节省750万公尺的布和1500个纺织工人。在第二个五年计划中要把这类化学产品提高三倍。
    布拉格人很考究衣服的样式，但是在日常工作的时候是很朴素的，不少人穿布料的衣服，我们在国内穿的卡其布雨衣，在布拉格男男女女作为春秋天的日常便服。然而到了下班回家以后，参加晚会或者节日的时候，每一个人都盛装起来，这时你从衣服上很难发现一个普通的食堂招待员和一个政府部长有什么区别。
    布拉格是一个有着古老文化艺术传统的城市，是一个安静的生活很舒适、方便的城市，但是很重要的它还是一个生产的城市，是一个大工业中心，在社会主义建设中担负着重要的任务，布拉格的九十多万居民中，有三十万是工业人口。
    如果你从市中心往西或者往东走远一些，在这里已听不到老城广场上古老钟楼上的钟声，这里响着的是各种各样机器的声音，成千成万的人在这里勤劳地生产着社会主义的财富。在这些工厂的附近，一幢幢的工人宿舍在建筑着。大都是六层到八层的新式楼房。
    在布拉格的工厂里，我们看到了一件很有意义的事，这就是很多企业把帮助农业合作社作为自己应尽的责任。在著名的斯大林格勒工厂的办公楼前面，竖着一块木制的地图，这是布拉格州的一个区的地图，斯大林格勒工厂负责帮助这个区的农业合作社。在地图上标明着各个合作社的位置。工厂组织工人帮助合作社义务劳动，利用废料和节省下来的材料制造农具送给合作社。
    五月的布拉格是最美丽的季节，整个城市覆盖着绿荫，城市一天比一天变得更美好，但是布拉格人并不是只图安静的，新五年计划的远大前景正成为人们谈论的中心，爱国主义的热情激动着人们的心，布拉格人了解布拉格这个社会主义阵营西端的欧洲名城，处在与西方资本主义世界和平竞赛的前哨，不论是斯大林格勒工厂的工人们，或者是白天鹅百货公司的店员，他们都知道自己肩上担负着重大的责任。（附图片）
