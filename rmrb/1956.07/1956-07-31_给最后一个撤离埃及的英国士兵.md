　　Across mountains and seas, news comes from Cairo: the last soldier of the British army, which occupied Egypt for a full seventy-four years, has finally shouldered his rifle and silently withdrawn from the Suez Canal Zone.

　　No country in the world is as ancient as Egypt; Egypt is the cradle of human civilization. The Great Pyramid of Cheops, though built as early as more than three thousand years before Christ, is not the oldest monument in Egypt; the Step Pyramid of Saqqara was built even earlier; as for the Sphinx, it is so ancient that even its exact age cannot be determined. In a word: Egypt is an ancient civilized country with more than six thousand years of culture. In these long years, seventy-four years are still considered short; however, the exploitation of the Egyptian people by British imperialism, even a second or a minute, is unbearable. The invaders of the past have all plundered the Egyptian people of their hard-earned cotton, leaving them with extreme poverty and ignorance, making the dead unable to rest in peace and the living suffer. Like a volcanic eruption, they finally relied on their own heroic struggle to drive all the foreign invaders out of their own land one by one. The heroine Umm Sabbaa, who bravely resisted the British invaders in the Suez Canal area and died a heroic death, will forever live in the hearts of the Egyptian people.

　　After the last batch of British sentries withdrew from Egyptian soil, John Lasi, the British garrison commander in Port Said, also boarded a British tank landing craft. He stood listlessly on the deck and said, "This is an unpleasant matter for us."

　　The situation is stronger than people; Egypt is no longer the era of the pyramids, and Western "generals" can no longer flaunt their power in front of the Egyptian people; even though they are unwilling to admit defeat in their hearts, they can no longer but admit their failure and return in disgrace. Their "unpleasantness" is imaginable, but you, Andrei, (assuming your name is Andrei, a common name in Christian countries) why are you silent?

　　Is it sadness for the decline of the British Empire? June 12th was the eve of your withdrawal from Egypt. In the lingering light of the setting sun, your last batch of withdrawing British troops lowered the last British flag in the desolation without the usual drums and bugles. The British Empire has always been known as the "Empire on which the sun never sets"; the world is vast, but now it is forced to retreat and lower its flag in one place after another. Let those die-hard imperialists be "unpleasant"! Under the anti-colonialist tide sweeping across the world, if they still cling to colonialism as a "lifesaver", then there will be even greater "unpleasantness", even the punishment of drowning. As for you, listen to the cheers bursting out from the hearts of the Egyptian people after the British flag is lowered and the Egyptian flag is raised. You will understand the direction of people's hearts at a glance.

　　Is it reluctance to leave the beautiful scenery of Egypt? Let's talk about the pyramids first. The pyramids, towering in the setting sun of the desert, are one of the wonders of the world, and everyone who has visited Egypt is amazed. Then there's the desert, which is like a vast ocean, with the desert changing endlessly with dawn and dusk, light and darkness. People say that the desert is barren, but the Egyptian desert is full of flowers and plants. There are twenty or so kinds of plants, such as datura flowers and wild bupleurum, in a small area, and the sand valleys are as prosperous as gardens. The architecture on both sides of the Nile is majestic, and the mountains are undulating, making it even more spectacular. Who says mountains and rivers are ruthless? For those who trample on the land of its motherland, it cannot force a smile, it can only make a silent protest. Anyway, there will be plenty of time in the future. Years later, when you visit as a distant tourist, every stone scattered in the desert conquered by the Egyptian people will crack open its mouth and smile at you, and along the way, people will offer you exotic fruits, send you fresh flowers, and lead you to a place of rest.

　　Is it guilt for your crimes? You are innocent, mostly deceived into going to Egypt by shameless lies. Just like the American "Georges" or "Jacks," they thought they were traveling across the ocean to Korea, where even black-haired, big-eyed ladies were waiting for them; they never dreamed that what awaited them was a terrible and shameful war, and they finally became cannon fodder for the warmongers, losing their lively lives in vain. You are much luckier than them to have survived, and your parents, who are eagerly waiting for your return, and your lover, who is longing for you, must be so excited. As a soldier of the British occupation army, it is unimaginable that you have never helped a tyrant or committed a crime. Your hands are bound to be stained with the blood of the Egyptian people. If you still retain some humanity and conscience, you cannot but feel ashamed and painful for your crimes, and you cannot but be speechless.

　　Under the heroic struggle of the Egyptian people, you and your companions were finally forced to retreat with your murderous guns. There is a good old saying in China: "It is not too late to mend the fold after the sheep are lost." You have a long time to make amends. There is a French boy named Henri Martin who was deceived into fighting in Vietnam. When he realized that it was a "dirty war," he resolutely put down his gun and returned to his country. This is a living example in front of you. There is also a French girl named Raymond Dien, twenty-one years old, who lay on the tracks to prevent the train carrying invading troops from passing. This is an even more glorious existence. Your return to your country this time is the end of sin and the beginning of a new life. As a witness, you must accuse the British occupation army of all kinds of crimes in Egypt to the British people and to the people of the world, forcing the British government to stop the bloody suppression in Malaya, and forcing the British government to withdraw its troops from various military bases abroad.

　　Now, it has been more than a month since you left Port Said sadly. Where are you? In Cyprus? Malta? Or London? You cannot find peace in these places either. The waves of the Mediterranean Sea cannot drown the cries for freedom from Cyprus and Algeria, and the noise of American planes in the British sky and the American soldiers rampant in London and Cambridge cannot but make you shudder. Moreover, now people are talking about sending you back to the Suez Canal Zone, letting you face again the Egyptian people burning with the fire-like passion for independence and freedom. In order to enable the holders of more than 350,000 Suez Canal Company shares to continue to receive staggering dividends every year, they demand that you make the Egyptian people bleed, and also demand that you shed your own blood, even pay your own life, for them.

　　Andrei, you should be clearer than anyone else who is the real owner of the Egyptian land. You should be clearer than anyone else that the Egyptian people will not be intimidated by any weapons. They have already said that they will use force to deal with force, and threats to deal with threats. Andrei, as a Briton, it is your inescapable duty, you should not only make your voice heard, you should take action. Now is the time to test you and your companions.

    给最后一个撤离埃及的英国士兵　
    王季深
    越过了高山和大海，开罗传来消息：占领了埃及整整七十四年的英国军队的最后一个士兵，终于背起他的步枪，默默地撤出了苏彝士运河区。
    世界上没有一个国家像埃及那么古老，埃及是人类文明的摇篮。岐奥普斯的大金字塔，虽然早在纪元前三千多年就建立了，却不是埃及最古的纪念物；萨卡拉的步阶金字塔建得可更早；至于人面狮身像竟久远得连确实的年代也无从考查了。一句话：埃及是一个拥有六千多年文化的文明古国。在这漫长的岁月中，七十四年还算是短暂的；但是，英帝国主义对于埃及人民的压榨，虽一分一秒钟也难以忍受。历来的侵略者，都劫走了埃及人民朵朵辛苦的棉花，而留给他们的，却是极端的贫困和愚昧，使死者不能瞑目，生者苦痛烦恼。像火山爆发一样，他们终于依靠自己的英勇斗争，把外国侵略者一个一个从本国的土地上全部撵了出去。在苏彝士运河地带奋勇抵抗英国侵略者而悲壮殉难的女英雄奥姆·萨巴，就永远活在埃及人民的心里。
    在英军的最后一批岗哨撤离了埃及土地之后，塞得港的英国驻军司令约翰·拉西接着也登上了英国坦克登陆艇。他无精打采地站在甲板上说：“这对于我们是一件不愉快的事。”
    形势比人还强，埃及不再是金字塔的时代了，西方“将军们”不能在埃及人民面前耀武扬威了；尽管从心里不服输，他们再也不能不承认自己的失败，铩羽而归了。他们的“不愉快”是可以想像的，而你，安德烈，（假定你的名字就叫安德烈，这是基督教国家常用的名字）为什么默默不言呢？
    是为大不列颠帝国的没落而悲伤吗？六月十二日，是你们撤离埃及的前夕。在夕阳残照之下，你们最后一批撤离的英国军队，在没有往常的鼓声和号声的凄凉中，降下了最后的一面英国旗。英帝国一向号称“日不落之国”；世界虽大，现在毕竟被迫而一处一处地偃旗息鼓了。让那些帝国主义死硬派“不愉快”去！在反殖民主义的怒潮席卷之下，假使他们还死抱住殖民主义当作“救命草”，那就有更大的“不愉快”，甚至灭顶丧生的惩罚等着他们。至于你，还是倾听一下英国国旗降落、埃及国旗升起后，埃及人民从心里迸发出来的欢呼吧。人心的向背，你是一看就明白的。
    是对埃及的绮丽风光留恋不舍吗？还是让我们先谈金字塔。雄踞在荒漠斜阳里的金字塔，是世界的奇观之一，凡是观光过埃及的人，没有一个不叹为观止的。再谈沙漠，它好似一片大海洋，晨昏、明晦，都会使沙漠变幻无穷。人说沙漠是不毛之地，而埃及的沙漠则花草丛生，什么曼陀罗花啊、野牛膝草啊，在小小的几方丈里，就有二十来种，沙谷繁荣得像花园一样。尼罗河两岸的建筑巍峨，山岭迤逦，更蔚为壮观。谁说山川无情？对于践踏着它的祖国土地的人，它是不能强颜为欢的，它只能作沉默的抗议。反正以后的日子长着呢，若干年后，当你以一个远方游客前去访问的时候，散处在那被埃及人民征服了的沙漠里的每一块石头，都会裂开嘴向你笑，沿途也会有人给你献奇果，送鲜花，引你到安憩的地方去。
    是对自己的罪行感到内疚吗？你是无辜的，多半是被无耻的谎言骗到埃及去的。正如美国的“乔治”或“杰克”们，满以为远渡重洋，到朝鲜旅行去，那里甚至还有黑头发、大眼睛的淑女们等着他们；做梦也没有想到：等着他们的是一场可怕而又可耻的战争，他们终于做了战争贩子的炮灰，白白地送了生龙活虎的性命。你能生还，倚闾望儿的双亲，两眼欲穿的爱人，该多么兴奋。你已经比他们幸运多了。作为英国占领军的一个士兵，不能想像，你没有帮过一次凶，犯过一次罪，你的两手免不了要沾染上埃及人民的鲜血。假使你还保留一些人性和良心的话，你就不能不因为自己的罪行而感到惶愧，而痛苦得说不出话来。
    在埃及人民的英勇斗争之下，你和你的伙伴们终于被迫背着杀人的枪撤退了。中国有句古话说得好：“亡羊而补牢，未为迟也”。你补过的日子还长着呢。法国有个叫亨利·马丁的男孩子，他被骗到越南打仗。当他发觉这是一场“肮脏的战争”的时候，他就坚决放下了枪，回到祖国去。这是在你面前的一个活榜样。法国还有一个叫雷蒙德·第安的二十一岁的女孩子，她躺在铁轨上，不准装运侵略军队的列车开过去。这更是一个光辉的存在。你这一次回国，是罪恶的结束，又是新生的开始。作为一个见证人，你就要把自己受骗的经过，你就要把英国占领军在埃及的种种罪行，在英国人民面前控诉，在全世界人民面前控诉，迫使英国政府停止在马来亚的血腥镇压，迫使英国政府撤回在国外各个军事基地的军队。
    现在，离开你黯然地离开塞得港已经一个多月了。你在哪里呢？在塞浦路斯？马耳他？还是伦敦？你在这些地方同样是得不到安宁的。地中海的波涛也淹没不了来自塞浦路斯和阿尔及利亚的要求自由的呼声，而英国上空美国飞机的噪音和在伦敦、剑桥横行的美国大兵，也不能不使你怵目惊心。而且，现在，人们又在谈论着要把你送回到苏彝士运河区去，让你去重新面对炽燃着火一样的独立自由的热情的埃及人民。为了使三十五万多张苏彝士运河公司股票的持有人能够继续每年得到惊人的红利，他们要求你去使埃及人民流血，也要求你为了他们而流你自己的血，以至付出你自己的生命。
    安德烈，你应当比谁都清楚，谁是埃及土地上真正的主人。你应当比谁都清楚，埃及人民是不会被任何武器吓倒的。他们已经说过，他们将要用武力来对付武力，用威胁来对付威胁。安德烈，你作为一个英国人，义不容辞，你不仅应该发出声音，你应该行动起来。现在是考验你和你的伙伴们的时候了。
