    The Mummy of the Cold War
    Shēn Shēn
    In recent years, the imperialist Cold War warriors have become increasingly anxious as the international situation has gradually eased. Influential American bourgeois newspapers such as the "Wall Street Journal" have even reached a conclusion that troubles the Cold War warriors: "No war theory will be widely accepted by the world."
    But they are always reluctant to wash their hands of it. They decided to look for opportunities to launch a Cold War frenzy, attempting to undermine the prestige of the Soviet Union and communist parties in various countries, and to return the world to a state of anti-communist hysteria.
    Provocateurs stirred up the incident in Poznan. The Western propaganda machine immediately shouted and screamed, comparing this incident to the 1953 Berlin provocation. This inadvertently revealed the essence of the incident. There is only one difference: at that time, a group of stupid and short-sighted reactionaries placed great hope in the Berlin provocation, hoping it would become the beginning of the overthrow of the German Democratic Republic. Today, the tone of the reactionaries is much lower. American officials have stated that they "do not expect a full-scale riot to occur throughout Poland." It seems that these gentlemen have lost a lot of confidence after years of being battered and bruised.
    Despite the shortcomings and errors in execution during the construction process, the socialist system is still infinitely superior to the capitalist system. It is the people's own regime and is loved by the people. The Poznan incident also proved this point. Although some of the working masses marched under the instigation of saboteurs, as soon as the saboteurs opened fire and attempted to attack municipal buildings, the broad masses of workers immediately saw through the enemy, and many stepped forward to defend their own regime.
    The conspiracy has once again shamefully gone bankrupt. However, the Wall Street fighters are still clinging to the mummy of the Cold War.
    On June 29, the U.S. State Department issued a "compassionate" statement, expressing "deep shock" at the incident, expressing so-called "sympathy" for the Polish people, and hoping that Poland would change its system. On the 30th, Undersecretary of State Hoover Jr. suggested giving Poland some so-called "relief food." Presumably, these gentlemen want to make a big fuss about it, indicating that only the American system is free and prosperous. Unfortunately, the American steelworkers did not take care of the State Department's painstaking efforts, and inappropriately started a large-scale strike of 650,000 people the day after Undersecretary Hoover Jr.'s "suggestion." I wonder if the respectable Wall Street fighters also express "deep shock" and "sympathy" for the plight of American workers, and whether they also actively suggest "relief" for American workers.
    Perhaps, because in their country, the workers' struggle against the capitalists' cruel oppression is too common—for example, the U.S. Department of Labor announced that from January to May of this year, there were a total of 1,750 strikes in the United States, with 730,000 workers participating—so it is not worth mentioning!

    冷战的木乃伊
    申申
    近年来，帝国主义冷战斗士们眼见得国际局势一步一步地和缓而焦躁不安。美国资产阶级有影响的报纸如“华尔街日报”者也得出了一个使冷战斗士们烦恼的结论：“任何战争理论都不会得到世界的广泛接受”。
    但是要就此洗手总是不甘心的。他们决定寻找机会发动一个冷战狂潮，企图打击苏联和各国共产党的威信，使世界重新处于反共歇斯底里的紧张状态。
    挑衅分子在波兹南挑起了事件。西方国家宣传机器立刻大喊大叫起来，把这一事件比诸1953年的柏林挑衅事件。不想这正好揭露了这次事件的实质。只是有一点不同：当时，曾有一批蠢笨短视的反动分子对柏林挑衅寄予很大希望，希望它成为推翻德意志民主共和国的开端。今天，反动派的调子显得低沉多了，美国官员们就表示“并不期待会发生波及波兰各地的全面暴动”。看来，这些先生们若干年来头破血流之余，毕竟也丧失了不少信心。
    尽管在建设过程中有着执行上的缺点和错误，社会主义制度仍然比资本主义制度无比优越，它是人民自己的政权，为人民所热爱。波兹南事件过程也证明了这一点。虽然有一些工人群众在破坏分子挑拨之下出来游行了，然而，一当破坏分子开枪并企图攻击市政建筑时，广大工人群众立即识破了敌人，许多人挺身捍卫自己的政权。
    阴谋已经又一次可耻地破产了。可是，华尔街斗士们还是死死地抱住冷战的木乃伊不放。
    六月二十九日，美国国务院发表了一个“悲天悯人”的声明，对这一事件“深为震惊”，对波兰人民表示所谓“同情”，希望波兰改变制度。三十日，副国务卿小胡佛又建议给波兰一些所谓“救济粮食”。想来，这些先生们是想借此大做文章，表示只有美国的制度是自由和富足的。可惜得很，美国钢铁工人没有照顾国务院这番苦心，却不合时宜地在副国务卿小胡佛“建议”的次日开始了六十五万人大罢工。不知道可尊敬的华尔街斗士们，是否也对美国工人的困苦处境表示“深为震惊”和“同情”，是否也积极地建议“救济”美国工人。
    也许，因为在他们的国家里，工人们反对资本家的残酷压迫的斗争是太平常了——例如，美国劳工部宣布，今年一月至五月，美国共发生一千七百五十次罢工，有七十三万工人参加，——所以倒不值一提了！
