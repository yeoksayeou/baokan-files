    Chongqing's Handwoven Cloth Industry
    to Use Electric Looms
    (According to Chongqing Daily) After the organization of Chongqing's handwoven cloth industry, a large number of electric looms were purchased, and some of the original hand looms were converted into electric looms. By the end of this year, 41% of the industry's handicraft workers will be using electric looms for production.
    After the original Yuhua Cloth Factory was merged into the Yuhua Textile Factory, it sold 260 electric looms along with the factory buildings to the cotton weaving specialized cooperative of the Municipal Handicraft Industry Cooperative. Some of the machines will be put into production by the end of July. At present, the cotton weaving specialized cooperative is actively repairing the newly purchased machines and factory buildings, and is carrying out organizational adjustments, merging the original Nan'an First, Second, and Third Cotton Weaving Cooperatives to form the Nan'an District First Weaving Production Cooperative, using the newly purchased machines and factory buildings. The newly established mechanized weaving cooperative will gradually transition to mainly producing high-grade textiles such as corduroy, gabardine, and poplin.
    This news greatly encouraged the production enthusiasm of the members after it was conveyed to the grassroots cooperatives. The defect rate of the Third Weaving Cooperative in Nan'an District decreased from the original 27.8% to 5.4%; the defect rates of the Second, Third, and Fourth Weaving Groups have also decreased to varying degrees.

    重庆市的土布行业
    将使用电动织布机
    据重庆日报讯　重庆市手工业土布行业在组织起来以后，购买了大批电动织布机，并且将原有部分手工织布机改装为电动织布机，到今年年底，全行业将有41％的手工业者使用电动织布机来生产。
    原裕华布厂并入裕华纺织厂后，已经将二六○台电动织布机连同厂房一并卖给市手工业联社棉织专业联社，七月底，将有部分机器投入生产。目前，棉织专业联社正积极修整新买的机器、厂房，并且进行组织调整工作，把原来的南岸第一、二、三棉织社合并成立南岸区第一织布生产合作社，使用新买的机器和厂房。新成立的机械化织布社将逐步过渡到主要是生产灯芯绒、华达呢、府绸等高级纺织品。
    这一消息传到各基层社后，大大鼓舞了社员们的生产热情，南岸区的第三织布社的次品率由原来27.8％降低到5.4％；第二、三、四织布小组的次品率也都有不同程度的降低。
