Xinhua News Agency, Baoding, July 29th: The large-scale DDT raw powder workshop, rebuilt by the state-owned Tianjin Chemical Plant in Hangu City, officially produced its first batch of products on July 25th. Preliminary analysis shows that the quality of this batch of raw powder is qualified, with a para-isomer (insecticidal ability) content of about 71%. Each ton of DDT raw powder can be used to prepare 142 tons of DDT insecticide.

This reconstruction project made full use of the original factory buildings. The entire project investment was only 85,000 yuan, and it was completed in just over five months.

In the past, most of the DDT raw powder used in our country was imported. The commissioning of this workshop will greatly change this situation.

    滴滴涕原粉车间投入生产
    新华社保定29日电　汉沽市国营天津化工厂改建的大型滴滴涕原粉车间，在七月二十五日正式生产出第一批产品。这批原粉经过初步分析质量合格，对位同素异形体（杀虫能力）的含量在71％左右。每吨滴滴涕原粉可以配制一百四十二吨滴滴涕杀虫剂。
    这个改建工程充分利用原有的厂房，全部工程投资只用了八万五千元，在五个多月的时间就建成了。
    过去我国所用的滴滴涕原粉大多是进口货。这个车间投入生产后，将大大改变这种情况。
