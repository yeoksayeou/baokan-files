Xinhua News Agency, Rangoon, July 23rd – According to official sources, the five-member committee of the Burmese Ministry of Education is nearing completion of a draft of a new four-year education plan aimed at universally raising the standards of Burmese students.

    This plan includes items concerning qualified teachers, new educational methods, more suitable textbooks, and the establishment of sufficient schools at all levels in districts, towns, and villages.

    According to an official publication, Burma has reformed and reoriented its entire education system since independence, adopting a unified education system. Burmese has replaced English as the language of instruction.

    The Burmese government stated in this publication that science, economics, and technical education were neglected during British rule, hindering the country's progress. The number of people studying engineering and medicine was very small. The annual expenditure of national primary and secondary schools was only about six million kyats, while after independence, this annual expenditure reached more than thirty million kyats.

    缅甸拟订新的教育计划
    新华社仰光23日电　据官方透露，缅甸教育部的五人委员会快要完成关于普遍提高缅甸学生水准的新的四年教育计划的草案。
    这项计划包括有关合格的师资，新的教育方法，更适宜的课本，在区、镇和乡村里开办足够的各级学校等项目。
    据官方的一份出版物说，缅甸在独立后对整个教育制度进行了改革和重定方针的工作，采用了一种统一的教育制度。缅甸文代替了英文作为教育的工具。
    缅甸政府在这份出版物当中说，在英国统治时期忽略了科学、经济和技术教育，妨碍了国家的进步。学习工程和医药课程的人数很少。国立的小学校和中学校的全年开支只有约六百万缅元，而在独立后这方面的全年开支达到三千万缅元以上。
