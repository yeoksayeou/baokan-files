Xinhua News Agency, Linyi, 13th: In order to ensure that more than 90% of cooperative members could increase their income, the Communist Party committees at all levels in the Linyi area of Shandong Province helped agricultural production cooperatives to check and correct the phenomenon of excessive non-productive personnel and excessive non-productive work recording during the wheat pre-distribution process.

Currently, among the 11,506 cooperatives in this area, 9,156 have reduced non-productive labor. In counties such as Tancheng, Linyi, Cangshan, and Pingyi, cooperatives with generally six to seven hundred households have reduced twelve to fifteen non-productive personnel.

Before the wheat pre-distribution, the agricultural production cooperatives in the Linyi area reviewed and cleared up past non-productive labor, and cut down on many non-productive tasks that should not have been recorded within the cooperative. Before the cleanup in Junan County, non-productive labor in each cooperative accounted for more than 4% of the total labor of the cooperative, but now most have been reduced to about 2%. The reduction of non-productive labor has increased the actual income of cooperative members. After the Hongxing Agricultural Production Cooperative in Daling Township, Linyi County, cleaned up and reduced non-productive labor, 94% of the 900 cooperative member households increased their income in the wheat season pre-distribution. The Jinxing Agricultural Production Cooperative in Honggou Township, Fei County, used to have ten full-time cadres who were separated from production. Coupled with excessive work delays by non-full-time cadres, and the fact that the heads of the amateur theater troupe, health workers, postmen, etc., also regularly recorded work points within the cooperative throughout the year, a total of 6,145 non-productive workdays were needed annually, equivalent to the annual earnings of thirty medium-strength laborers. Now, after reducing four full-time cadres and cleaning up other aspects of non-productive labor, the annual expenditure of 2,235 labor days can be reduced. Calculated at twenty jin of grain per labor day, cooperative members can earn an additional 44,700 jin of grain.

    减少非生产性用工和非生产人员
    山东临沂地区农业社社员多收了粮食
    新华社临沂13日电　山东省临沂地区的各级中共党委为了保证90％以上的社员能够增加收入，在小麦预分过程中帮助农业生产合作社检查纠正了非生产人员过多和非生产性记工过多的现象。
    现在，这个地区的11，506个社，已有9，156个减少了非生产性用工。郯城、临沂、苍山、平邑等县一般六七百户的社，就减少了十二到十五个非生产人员。
    临沂地区的农业生产合作社在小麦预分以前，对以往的非生产性用工进行了审查和清理，削减了许多不应该由社内记工的非生产性用工。莒南县在清理以前，各个社的非生产性用工都占到全社用工总数的4％以上，现在大部分都降到了2％左右。非生产性用工的减少，使得社员增加了实际收入。临沂县大岭乡红星农业生产合作社在清理和减少非生产性用工以后，全社九百户社员有94％在麦季预分中增加了收入。费县洪沟乡金星农业生产合作社过去有十个脱离生产的专职干部，再加上非专职干部的误工过多，和业余剧团的负责人、保健员、邮递员等也都常年在社内记工，全年共需要非生产用工6，145个，相当于三十个中等劳力一年所得的劳动日。现在在减少了四个专职干部和清理其它方面的非生产性用工以后，全年可以减少2，235个劳动工日的支出，按每个劳动日分粮二十斤计算，就可以使社员多收入四万四千七百斤粮食。
