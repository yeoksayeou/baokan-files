Close Cultural Relations Between the Peoples of China and Mexico
Marco Arturo Montiel, Head of the Delegation of the National Front of Plastic Arts of Mexico

    Since my childhood, living in Mexico and Cuba, I have known the Chinese people.
    At school and in the study of my enlightened and passionate grandfather, I greedily read those extraordinary stories about the ancient culture of this country and the magical adventures of Marco Polo. Later, I also read a large number of travel notes written by writers seeking exoticism. In my youthful travels, I often came into contact with Chinese expatriates, especially in California, Los Angeles, and Mexicali on the US-Mexico border. There, the commercial power of the Chinese, the banks, and the disgraceful smuggling, opium dens, and casinos enriched the pockets of many adventurers.
    But at that time, many important events had already occurred in the world. Since 1910, the great Chinese Revolution led by Sun Yat-sen and our agrarian revolution echoed each other. These two revolutions, especially in terms of general policy, had many similarities: the struggle for land and against feudalism, and the heroic struggle against the same vicious foreign imperialism in our respective countries. Furthermore, we also had hopes and sympathy for the Kuomintang at that time. But soon after, the Kuomintang shamefully betrayed the revolution, established an unprecedentedly corrupt rule, and carried out barbaric suppression of the Chinese people. At that time, the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army began its unprecedented heroic Long March. We watched with the most excitement all the major events in this arduous struggle. After the end of the Anti-Japanese War, after the Chinese people achieved their final victory, the People's Republic of China was finally established. All this told us that one of the most important things had happened in history, Asia had begun to completely liberate itself, the people of the former colonial countries were greatly encouraged, and imperialism was being driven out of its sphere of influence one by one. China and the Soviet Union together have become the strongest fortress of peace.
    We came to China with such feelings. Everything we have seen, studied, and learned in China in the past half month has deeply moved and surprised us. A huge China rich in creative labor has stood up and is moving forward with the confidence that only a socialist country can have.
    In addition, what we have seen is not a completely different and unfamiliar world, but everywhere we go, we see many extremely gratifying similarities with our country. There are too many of these similarities to mention; they can be clearly seen among the Chinese people, in folk art, and in traditions and customs. We are in such a friendly atmosphere, and everything we see impresses us. It would take a long time to write in detail about our many impressions.
    Our Mexican National Front of Plastic Arts, at the friendly invitation of the Chinese Artists Association and the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, came to Beijing to hold an exhibition of Mexican oil paintings and prints, which includes 152 oil paintings and nearly four hundred prints, with the aim of expanding cultural exchanges between the two peoples; this is a significant event. The significance of this event lies not only in holding an exhibition dedicated to the work of artists, but also in introducing as widely as possible the situation of the Mexican art world since the 1922 revolution. The exhibition includes works by the founders and masters of the movement, such as Orozco, Rivera, and Siqueiros, as well as works by rising stars who are faithful to the principles of the revolution and inherit, support, and enrich the Mexican painting movement with a firm national style. Therefore, it has achieved great success in Paris, Stockholm, London, and the people's democratic countries it has visited.
    Unreasonable international political situations have interrupted our normal relations. However, it is clear that our people feel it is necessary to establish normal relations with China, with the only true government representing the Chinese nation. We have established a China Friendship Association in Mexico, which is increasingly supported by the people. Some stubborn elements are trying to ignore the existence of a great country of 600 million people, but they will not be able to disregard this exhibition; these 600 million Chinese people are today building their happy lives.
    Starting from our visit to China this time, there will be a continuous exchange of art exhibitions, literary exchanges, and active exchange of cultural delegations.
    In a short visit, we have seen amazing things. We have established friendly relations with artists, writers, students, workers, and farmers. The three days spent in a nearby agricultural cooperative moved us extremely, made us realize many things, and established a friendship that will never be interrupted. The city of Beijing itself showed us its bright future. China has washed away the shame it suffered in the past and has embarked on a bright path. For us, this is a very valuable experience, and we will make full use of it.
    Now we must strive for the noble cause of peace, for the just and peaceful coexistence of all countries and the friendly exchange of experiences. We believe our exhibition will be a very meaningful way.
    On behalf of the Mexican National Front of Plastic Arts, I extend warm greetings of solidarity and sympathy to the artists and people of the People's Republic of China.

### 中墨两国人民之间密切的文化关系

    中墨两国人民之间密切的文化关系
    墨西哥全国造型艺术阵线代表团团长  马尔哥·阿尔多罗·蒙太洛
    自从我的幼年时代，在墨西哥和古巴居住的时候起，我就对中国人民有了认识。
    在学校里和在我那开明而热情的祖父的书房里，我贪婪地阅读着那些有关这个国家古老文化的异乎寻常的故事和马可波罗的神奇的冒险事迹。后来，我又大量地阅读了寻求异国情调的作家所写的旅行杂记。在我青年时代的旅行生活里，我经常地接触到中国侨民，特别是加利福尼亚、洛杉矶和美墨两国交界地区米希加利城的华侨。在那里，中国人的商业势力、银行和不光彩的走私行为，鸦片烟和赌场丰富了多少冒险家的腰包。
    但是在那个时候，世界上已发生了不少重要事件。自从1910年起，孙中山所领导的伟大中国革命和我们的农业革命先后呼应。这两次革命，特别是在总方针上，具有很多相似之点：争取土地与反封建主义的斗争，和各在本国对同样凶恶的外国帝国主义所进行的英勇斗争。更进一步，我们当时也曾对国民党抱着希望与同情。但是不久之后，国民党就可耻地叛变了革命，建立了闻所未闻的腐败统治，并对中国人民进行野蛮的镇压。在那时，中国工农红军开始了它的空前未有的英勇长征。我们曾以最激动的心情注视着这项艰巨斗争中的一切重大事件。在抗日战争结束之后，在中国人民取得了最后的胜利之后，终于建立了中华人民共和国。这一切都告诉我们：在历史上发生了一件最重要的事情，亚洲已开始彻底解放自己，从前的殖民地国家的人民受到了很大的鼓舞，帝国主义从它的势力范围里逐一地被赶出去了。中国和苏联一起，已成为最坚强的和平堡垒。
    我们就是怀着这样的心情来到了中国。最近半个月我们在中国看到的、研究的和了解到的一切使我们十分感动和惊奇。一个富于创造性劳动的巨大中国已经站了起来，并以只有在一个建设社会主义的国家中才能有的信心向前迈进。
    此外，我们所见到的不是一个完全不同而又陌生的世界，而是每行一步都见到有许多极为令人欣喜的与我国相同的地方。要提起这些相同的地方可就太多了，在中国的人民中间、民间艺术中间、传统和习惯中间都能明显地见到这些相似之点。我们处在这样的友好气氛中，所见到的一切使我们为之折服。要详细写我们那么多的观感将需要很长的时间。
    我们墨西哥全国造型艺术阵线这次受中国美术家协会和中国人民对外文化协会友好的邀请，到北京来举办了一个墨西哥油画与版画展览会，其中有152幅油画，将近四百幅版画，目的在于展开两国人民之间的文化交流；这是一个意义重大的事件。这个事件的意义不在于仅仅举办一个致力于艺术工作的画家们的展览会，而是在于竭尽可能地广泛介绍墨西哥从1922年革命以来的画界运动的情况。在展览会中有运动的创始人和绘画大师的作品，如像奥罗斯科、李维拉、西盖洛斯等人的作品，同时也有后起之秀的作品，这些后起之秀忠实于革命的原则，并带有坚定的民族风格来继承、支持、并丰富墨西哥的绘画运动。因此，它在巴黎、斯德哥尔摩、伦敦以及它所到过的人民民主国家里都取得了很大的成功。
    不合理的国际政治局面中断了我们之间的正常关系。但是，很明显，我国人民感到必须同中国，同唯一真正的、代表中华民族的政府建立正常的联系。我们已经在墨西哥建立了一个中国之友社，它日益在人民中得到支持。有些顽固分子，他们企图漠视伟大的六亿人口的国家的存在，但是他们将无法轻视这次展览会；这六亿中国人民今日正在建设他们的美满生活。
    从我们这次到中国访问开始，将来会不断有艺术展览会的交流、文学交流和活跃地交换文化代表团。
    在短短的访问中，我们已经见到令人惊奇的事物。我们已经与艺术家、作家、学生、工人、农民建立了友好关系。在附近的一个农业合作社中所度过的三天，使我们极为感动，使我们认识到许多事物，并且建立了永远不会中断的友谊。北京这个城市本身使我们见到它光明的前途。中国洗雪掉它过去所受的耻辱，走上了光明的道路。对于我们说来，这是一个有很大价值的经验，我们将要充分利用这个经验。
    现在我们要尽力为崇高的和平事业而努力，为各国人民之间公正的和平共处、友好的经验交流而努力。我们相信我们的展览会将是一个很有意义的方式。
    我谨代表墨西哥全国造型艺术阵线，向中华人民共和国的艺术家和人民致以热烈的团结和同情的敬礼。
