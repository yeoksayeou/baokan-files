Yunnan University Investigates Speech in Wenshan and Other Areas

(From the Yunnan Daily Editorial Department) The Linguistics Teaching and Research Group of the Chinese Department of Yunnan University recently conducted a survey of the phonetics in Wenshan, Qujing, Chuxiong, Yiliang, Baoshan, Zhaotong, Gejiu, Kunming and other places, and found the corresponding rules between the dialects of these places and Beijing pronunciation. The teaching and research group believes that for Yunnan people to speak Mandarin, apart from a few different pronunciations, such as Yunnan people pronouncing ㄓㄔㄕ as ㄗㄘㄙ, and pronouncing ㄩ (yu - fish) as "Yi," in general, it is only necessary to correct the tones of the dialect according to the four tones of Beijing pronunciation: yin, yang, shang, and qu, without having to correct each character one by one. At present, the teaching and research group is organizing the investigated materials and preparing to continue the investigation and research during this year's summer vacation.

    云南大学在文山等地调查语音
    本报讯　云南大学中文系语言学教研组，最近对文山、曲靖、楚雄、宜良、保山、昭通、个旧、昆明等地的语音作了调查，找出了这些地方的方言和北京语音的对音规律。教研组认为，云南人说普通话，除个别读音不同的，如云南人把ㄓㄔㄕ的音读成ㄗㄘㄙ，把ㄩ（鱼）的音读成“彝”等以外，一般的只需要按照北京音的阴、阳、上、去四个声调改正方言的声调即可，用不着一个字音一个字音的去改正。现在，教研组正在把所调查的材料进行整理，并且准备在今年暑假期间，继续进行调查和研究。
