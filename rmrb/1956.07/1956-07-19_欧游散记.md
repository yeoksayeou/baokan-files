[XVI] Neapolitan Fish Soup

Naples is a large port in southern Italy. Under the cloudless southern sky, the green sea is as calm as a mirror. But when the tide rises at night, it is a different scene altogether. In the seaside restaurants, the sound of the wind and waves roars in your ears. The owners urge us to drink heartily, introducing Naples' famous seafood. There is a fish soup, said to be called "Fisherman's Soup," where the fishermen at sea cook together all kinds of small fish left over from the day's sales. In this way, the home cooking of poor fishermen has become a top delicacy in the city.

In this restaurant, groups of musicians often come to sing for the guests. Usually it's a six-string guitar, a violin, and a soloist, performing famous Neapolitan folk songs, like "O Sole Mio!" etc. Italian singers have a high reputation, but just like the "gondola" gondolier singers we met in Venice, the hardships of life have made their voices hoarse, and when singing high notes, they have to use falsetto. Of course, like all folk musicians' performances, it still has a rich flavor.

The Underground City of Pompeii

About fifty kilometers from Naples, under the famous volcano, the ancient city of Pompeii was buried under volcanic lava for more than a thousand years. After two or three hundred years of excavation, an area of several square kilometers around it has been turned into a museum. At the entrance, many women are peddling fishbone brooches that they claim to have just carved themselves. They often give you a small pin first, making it difficult for you not to choose something for at least two or three thousand lire. These little trinkets are very well carved. And portraits painted on ivory panels are even more meticulously crafted.

In the museum's newly built exhibition hall, the exhibits tell the story of this city. In the decades of the AD, a volcanic eruption buried the entire city. The ruins of the excavated buildings are still in the wild, and important murals, artifacts, fossils, etc. are displayed in this building. The most eye-catching are the murals inlaid with gravel called "mosaics". A war picture, three or four meters square, is said to be made of hundreds of thousands of small colored stones. The image is very lifelike, and from a distance, the colors are almost like oil paintings. Some Greek-style pottery have beautiful patterns of war, hunting, figures, flowers, and birds. The fossils of a woman and a dog show the suffering of the city's residents and livestock in the face of an unexpected natural disaster.

Leaving the exhibition hall and crossing a street of ruins is the city's square. Some finely carved stones remain from the building of a "Wool Guild". Under the Roman-style columns of the central Temple of Heaven site, only the head of the majestic statue of Jupiter remains.

The most complete building is a nobleman's residence, with a colonnade of long columns on all three sides of the courtyard. In the front yard is a secret room, specially designed by the wealthy owner to house women, and the walls are painted with some obscene pictures. The residences of ordinary people, on the other hand, often had only a small patio, and of course, none of those majestic columns.

    〔十六〕那不勒斯的鱼汤
    那不勒斯是意大利南方的一个大港。在万里无云的南方的晴空下，绿色的大海就像镜子一样的平静。但到了潮水上涨的夜晚，就是另外一种景色了。在海边的饭店，风浪就像在耳边轰鸣。主人们向我们殷勤劝酒，介绍那不勒斯著名的海鲜。有一种鱼汤，据说叫“渔人汤”，海上的渔人把每天卖剩下的各种小鱼煮在一起。就这样，穷渔人的家常做法，变成了城市中的上等美味了。
    就在这饭馆里，经常有三五成群的音乐家来为客人唱歌。往往是一个六弦琴，一把提琴和一个独唱家，演唱着著名的那不勒斯民歌，像“呵，我的太阳！”等等。意大利歌手有着很高的声誉，但正像我们在威尼斯遇到的“冈多拉”船夫歌唱家一样，生活的折磨已使他们的歌喉沙哑，在唱到高音的时候，只好用假声来演唱。当然，像所有的民间音乐家的演奏一样，还是有着醇厚的韵味。地下的庞贝城
    离那不勒斯五十公里左右，在著名的火山下面，古代的庞贝城曾被埋葬在火山溶岩下面达一千多年之久。经过二、三百年的发掘，周围数平方公里的一个地区已辟作博物馆。在入口的地方，许多妇女拿着据说是她们自己刚刻的鱼骨领针兜售。她们往往先送给你一个小别针，使得你不好不选购那些起码付价二、三千里拉的东西。这些小玩意刻得很好。而一种画在象牙板上的肖像画，则手笔更为工整。
    在博物馆新建的陈列室中，陈列品叙述着这个城市的故事。纪元数十年，火山爆发把整个城市都埋葬了。发掘出来的建筑物的废墟仍在野外，重要的壁画、器物、化石等都陈列在这个房子中。最惹人注目的是用碎石镶嵌的叫做“莫赛克”的一种壁画。三、四公尺见方的一幅战争图画，据说是用十数万块颜色的小石块砌成的。形象很是逼真，从远处看，色彩简直像油画一样。一些希腊式的陶器上有着关于战争、狩猎、人物、花鸟的美丽图形。一个妇人和一只狗的化石，可以看到在猝不及防的天灾中，这个城市的居民和牲畜受难的情景。
    走出陈列室，穿过一条街道的废墟便是这个城市的广场，一座“羊毛公会”的建筑还留下一些精工雕琢的石块。正中的天神庙遗址的罗马式的圆柱下面，威严的周彼得的雕像只剩下一个头部了。
    最完整的建筑是一个贵族的住宅，庭院中三面全是一列列长柱的回廊。在前院有一个密室，是豪富的主人专为窝藏妇女而设的，壁上还画着一些淫秽的图画。而一般平民的住宅，则往往只有一个小天井，当然也没有那些巍峨的廊柱了。
