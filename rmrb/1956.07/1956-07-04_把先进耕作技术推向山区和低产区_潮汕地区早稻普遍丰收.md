Xinhua News Agency, Shantou, July 3rd (Xinhua News Agency reporter Wang Man, Li Zuoji): The early rice in the Chaoshan region, a well-known high-yield rice area, has achieved a bumper harvest this year, whether in the plains, coastal areas, hills, or mountains. The unit area yield of early rice in the plains reached about 450 jin, an increase of 20% over last year. Mountainous and hilly areas generally increased production by 30% to 40%, with yields of 350 jin to 400 jin per mu. In Chenghai County, a coastal area, the farming system was changed this year, and 60,000 mu of sandy fields, which used to only grow late rice, harvested more than 180,000 dan of early rice for the first time.

This spring, after the realization of agricultural cooperation in Chao'an, Chenghai, Chaoyang, Jieyang, Puning and other five counties in the Chaoshan region, a thousand-jin-per-mu high-yield competition movement was launched. The counties criticized the past leadership ideology that only valued the plains and neglected mountainous and low-yield areas. They formulated specific measures to comprehensively lead production to tap the production potential of low-yield areas.

A common characteristic of low-yield areas is that cultivation is extensive and the technology is worse than in the plains. Therefore, the counties put forward the slogan of "promoting advanced technologies from the plains to mountainous and low-yield areas." In addition to strengthening the leadership in these areas, the counties established technology extension stations and held technology training classes. Jieyang County also set up a work group to develop mountainous areas, specializing in guiding production in mountainous areas. Before and after the spring plowing this year, Jieyang, Chao'an, and Puning organized farmers in mountainous areas to observe sowing and transplanting in the plains, or organized cooperative directors and model workers in the plains to pass on experience in mountainous areas. As a result, a series of advanced technologies, such as close planting with small seedlings, cultivating strong seedlings, and rational irrigation and drainage, were comprehensively promoted in these areas. In the hilly areas with sandy soil, methods of applying mud fertilizer and native miscellaneous fertilizer were adopted to improve the soil, resulting in significant increases in production in these low-yield areas. Another characteristic of these areas is poor water conservancy conditions. This year, the counties focused on water conservancy construction in these areas. After the autumn harvest last year, the Chenghai County Party Committee mobilized farmers to start the construction of water conservancy projects such as the Shibanxia irrigation project drawing water from the Han River, which provided sufficient fresh water for 60,000 mu of sandy fields, allowing early rice to be planted for the first time this year. Wells were generally dug in the hilly areas of Chaoyang County, overcoming the difficulty of water shortage. The hilly areas in the first and eleventh districts of the county, which had lower yields in the past, achieved yields of more than 500 jin per mu this year, becoming one of the county's high-yield areas.

Now, the cooperative members are shouting at the oxen on the plains, plowing the land. They are working hard to achieve a yield of 1,000 jin per mu on the plains.

### 把先进耕作技术推向山区和低产区  潮汕地区早稻普遍丰收

    把先进耕作技术推向山区和低产区
    潮汕地区早稻普遍丰收
    新华社汕头3日电　新华社记者王曼、黎作骥报道：著名水稻高产区——潮汕地区的早稻，无论是平原、海滨、丘陵地或山区，今年都获得了丰收。平原地区早稻单位面积产量达到450斤左右，比去年增产两成，山区和丘陵地带普遍增产三、四成，每亩收成350斤到400斤。滨海的澄海县，今年改变了耕作制度，有六万亩往年只种晚稻的沙田，第一次收获了十八万多担早稻。
    潮汕地区的潮安、澄海、潮阳、揭阳、普宁等五个县，今春在实现农业合作化后，掀起了一个千斤丰产竞赛运动。各县批判了过去只重视平原，忽视山区和低产区的领导思想，都制定了全面领导生产的具体措施，要把低产区的生产潜力挖掘出来。
    低产区有一个共同特点，就是耕作粗放，技术比平原差。因此，各县都提出了“把平原的先进技术推向山区和低产区”的口号。除了加强这些地区的领导力量外，各县都在这些地区设立了技术推广站，开办技术训练班。揭阳县还特设了开发山区的工作组，专门指导山区的生产。今年春耕前后，揭阳、潮安、普宁都先后组织山区农民到平原区观摩播种和插秧，或组织平原区的合作社主任、劳模到山区传授经验。因而，小株密植、培育壮秧、合理排灌等一系列先进技术便在这些地区全面推广起来。在沙质土壤的丘陵地区，采用了施泥肥和土杂肥的办法来改良土壤，使这些低产区获得显著的增产。这些地区的另一个特点是水利条件很差。今年，各县都着重在这些地区兴修了水利。中共澄海县委去年秋收后便发动农民着手兴修石板下引韩灌溉等水利工程，从而使六万亩沙田有充足的淡水灌溉，今年第一次种上了早稻。潮阳县的丘陵地带普遍挖掘了水井，克服了水源缺乏的困难。该县第一区和第十一区的丘陵地，往年产量较低，今年每亩产量达五百多斤，成为全县的高产区之一。
    现在，合作社员们又在平原上吆喝着耕牛在翻犁土地了。他们正为平原每亩土地的产量达到千斤而紧张劳动着。
