    Another Valuable Contribution to World Science
    The Soviet Union Prepares to Build a Solar Power Station
    (People's Daily, Moscow, July 29th) The first industrial power station to generate electricity using solar energy is being prepared for construction on the Ararat Plain in Armenia. This is another valuable contribution by Soviet scholars to world science. From now on, the sun will supply humanity with its own current for production purposes.
    The solar power station is built using the principle of mirror reflection. Its appearance is different from other thermal power stations; it has neither tall chimneys nor dams, but rather a circular plane with a diameter of about one kilometer. In the center of the circle is a forty-meter-high tower, on which a steam boiler is placed. Around the center are twenty-three circular tracks of different sizes, on which trains travel. The special frames of the train carriages hold large mirrors, totaling 1,293. The trains always keep the mirrors facing the sun, and the mirrors reflect sunlight onto the steam boiler, boiling the water. The steam released from the boiling water passes through a duct to drive a turbine, generating electricity. The solar power station will generate 1,200 kilowatts of electricity.
    In addition to supplying electricity for industrial use daily, the solar power station will also drive water pumps to drain water from the many swampy areas of the Ararat Plain, which will be used to irrigate tens of thousands of hectares of land.

    对世界科学的又一宝贵贡献 
    苏联准备建立太阳能电站
    本报莫斯科29日电　第一座利用太阳能发电的工业发电站准备在亚美尼亚的阿拉拉特平原上建立。这是苏联学者对于世界科学的又一宝贵的贡献，从此太阳将以自己的电流供给人类用于生产方面。
    太阳能发电站是应用镜子的反射原理建成的。它的外貌与其他热电站不同，既没有高大的烟筒，也没有堤坝，而是一个直径约一公里的圆形平面。圆周中心是一个四十公尺高的塔，塔上放着蒸气锅炉，圆心的周围有二十三个大小不同的圆周规道，在这些规道上行走着火车，它的车厢的特制架子上放着大镜子，共有1，293面，火车永远保持镜子向着阳光，镜子把太阳光反射到蒸气锅内，使水煮沸，煮沸后的水放出的蒸气通过筒道推动涡轮机，发出电流，太阳能发电站将发电一千二百瓩。
    太阳能发电站除每日供给工业之用的电流外，还将推动抽水机把阿拉拉特平原上的许多沼泽地区的水抽出来，用以灌溉几万公顷的田地。
