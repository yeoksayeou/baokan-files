Syria is located on the eastern coast of the Mediterranean Sea, bordering Turkey, Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon, and Israel. It has an area of over 180,000 square kilometers and a population of 3,756,000, of which 85% are Muslims. The capital of Syria is Damascus, with a population of over 350,000.

Syria is an ancient country with thousands of years of history and cultural traditions. In the eastern part of Damascus, castles and grottoes left over from the Roman era, ancient palaces, and magnificent mosques are still preserved. The famous Damascus Museum displays various cultural relics of the Ammonites, Canaanites, and Phoenicians who settled in Syria more than 2,000 years ago.

In recent centuries, Syria has suffered from foreign aggression. In the sixteenth century, Syria was occupied by Turkey and became part of the Ottoman Empire. After the First World War, it became a French mandated territory. During the Second World War, due to the upsurge of the Syrian national independence and liberation movement, France had to declare Syria's independence on September 27, 1941, and withdrew its troops from Syria in August 1946.

The western part of Syria, near the Mediterranean Sea, is a rich and fertile land. More than 80% of the country's population is concentrated here, making it the most developed agricultural area in Syria. The eastern part is mainly desert and grassland, with cultivation only possible in the Tigris and Euphrates river basins.

Syria is an agricultural country, with the agricultural population accounting for more than 80% of the total population. The country's arable land area is approximately 4.5 million hectares. The main agricultural product is wheat. In recent years, the planting area of cotton in Syria has increased. Major agricultural products also include barley, corn, olives, grapes, and tobacco.

During the Second World War, some of Syria's national industries, mainly light industries such as textiles, cigarettes, flour, olive oil, cement, leather, and food, developed. Syria's industry has seen further development in recent years.

Syria's economy has long been controlled by foreign capital. Now, the Syrian government is gradually recovering France's special privileges in Syria's finance and economy.

Syria is a republic. According to the constitution promulgated in 1950, the President of Syria is the head of state, elected by the parliament for a term of four years. The parliament is the highest legislative body of the country, with 142 members, elected for a term of four years. The current president is Shukri al-Quwatli.

In October 1954, Syria elected a communist member for the first time in its history—Khaled Bakdash, the General Secretary of the Syrian and Lebanese Communist Party—as a member of parliament.

Before Syria's independence, there were only eight hundred college students in the country. Now there are five thousand college students in Damascus, and the number of female college students has increased fiftyfold compared to before the war. Many primary and secondary schools have been built throughout Syria. In the past, under colonial rule, 80% of the country's population was illiterate. Now, even in the most remote villages, schools have been established.

In recent years, the Syrian people have struggled to defend the country's independence and security. After the Turkish-Iraqi Pact was signed in 1955, the United States put pressure on Syria, attempting to force Syria to join this military treaty. U.S. officials once said, "If Syria does not yield, this country will be wiped off the map of the Middle East." But Syria was not intimidated and still refused to join.

Syria also firmly opposes the Baghdad Pact organized by the United States in the Middle East.

In October 1955, Syria signed an alliance treaty with Egypt to strengthen friendly cooperation among Arab countries. The treaty stipulates: "The two countries shall fully coordinate the policies adopted in military, economic, and international relations."

Syria pursues an independent foreign policy. The Syrian government has stated that "Syria is unwilling to accept the instructions of any country, and the policies it pursues can only be determined according to its own national interests" and has expressed its desire to "cooperate sincerely with all friendly countries."

The Syrian government is unwilling for its economy and sovereignty to be controlled by foreign countries and has consistently rejected the U.S.'s so-called "Point Four Program" aid.

Syria participated in the Asian-African Conference and worked with Asian and African countries to implement the resolutions of the conference.

In recent years, the Syrian government has strengthened economic and trade exchanges with the Soviet Union and people's democratic countries. In May 1955, the Syrian Peace Delegation visited the Soviet Union.

After the founding of the People's Republic of China, Syria and China had friendly contacts. In October 1952, Syrian religious leader Muhammad Al-Ashmar came to China to participate in the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference held in Beijing. In September 1954, Syria invited China to participate in the Damascus International Fair.

During the Asian-African Conference, the Chinese and Syrian delegations expressed their desire to strengthen economic cooperation and cultural exchanges between the two countries. On November 30, 1955, the Syrian government and the Chinese government signed a trade agreement and a payment agreement in Damascus, stipulating that both parties would establish commercial representative offices in each other's capitals. On June 12, 1956, the two countries signed a cultural cooperation agreement. Friendly exchanges between the two countries have also become increasingly frequent. Since August 1955, Syrian peace activists, members of parliament, and delegations of legal workers have visited China. The Chinese Cultural and Art Delegation also visited Syria in May this year for performances. In order to strengthen the friendship between the Chinese and Syrian people, Syria also established the Syrian-Chinese Friendship Association. On July 2, 1956, the Syrian government announced its recognition of China and the establishment of diplomatic relations with China. The friendly relations between China and Syria have entered a new stage.

    叙利亚
    叙利亚位于地中海的东岸，和土耳其、伊拉克、约旦、黎巴嫩、以色列等国接壤，面积十八万多平方公里，人口三百七十五万六千人，其中85％信奉伊斯兰教。叙利亚的首都大马士革，人口在三十五万以上。
    叙利亚是一个有着几千年历史和文化传统的古国。在大马士革的东部，现在还保存有罗马时代遗留下的城堡与石窟、古老的皇宫和壮丽的清真寺。在著名的大马士革博物馆内，陈列着公元前两千多年定居在叙利亚的亚孟人、迦南人、腓尼基人等的各种文物。
    近数百年来，叙利亚遭受了外国势力的侵略。十六世纪时，叙利亚被土耳其侵占，成为奥斯曼帝国的一部分。第一次世界大战后，成为法国的委任统治地。第二次世界大战中，由于叙利亚民族独立解放运动的高涨，法国不得不在1941年9月27日宣布了叙利亚独立，并且在1946年8月从叙利亚撤出它的军队。
    叙利亚西部靠地中海一带，是一片富饶肥沃的土地。全国80％以上的人口都集中在这里，是叙利亚农业最发达的地区。东部主要是沙漠和草原，只有底格里斯河和幼发拉底河流域可以种植。
    叙利亚是一个农业国，农业人口占全国人口的80％以上。全国耕地面积约为四百五十多万公顷。主要农产品是小麦。近年来叙利亚棉花的种植面积有了增加。主要的农产品还有大麦、玉蜀黍、橄榄、葡萄和烟草等。
    在第二次世界大战期间，叙利亚的一部分民族工业，主要的是轻工业，如纺织、卷烟、面粉、橄榄油、水泥、皮革、食品等工业得到了发展。叙利亚的工业近年来已经有了进一步的发展。
    叙利亚的经济长期为外国资本所控制。现在叙利亚政府正陆续收回法国在叙利亚财政经济方面的特权。
    叙利亚是一个共和政体的国家，根据1950年所颁布的宪法，叙利亚总统是国家的元首，由议会选举产生，任期四年，议会为国家最高立法机关，有议员142席，由选举产生，任期四年。现在总统是舒克里·库阿特利。
    1954年10月，叙利亚历史上第一次选出了一名共产党员——叙利亚与黎巴嫩共产党总书记啥勒德·巴克达斯为国会议员。
    叙利亚独立前，全国只有八百个大学生，现在在大马士革已经有了五千个大学生，其中女大学生的数目比战前增加了五十倍。叙利亚全国各地兴建了许多中小学。过去在殖民统治下，全国80％的人口是文盲，现在，即便是在最偏僻的乡村里，也建立了学校。
    近些年来，叙利亚人民为了保卫国家的独立和安全进行了斗争。1955年，土耳其—伊拉克条约签订后，美国便对叙利亚施加压力，企图迫使叙利亚参加这个军事条约。美国的官员曾说“叙利亚如果不屈服，这个国家就要从中东的地图上被抹掉”。但是叙利亚并没有被吓倒，仍然拒绝参加。
    叙利亚也坚决反对美国在中东组织的巴格达条约。
    1955年10月，叙利亚为了加强阿拉伯国家间的友好合作，同埃及签订了联盟条约。条约规定：“两国在军事问题、经济问题和国际关系方面所采取的政策进行充分的配合”。
    叙利亚奉行着独立的外交政策。叙利亚政府曾表示“叙利亚不愿接受任何一个国家的指令，它所奉行的方针，只能根据自己的民族利益决定”，并表示要“和一切友好国家进行真诚合作”。
    叙利亚政府不愿本国的经济与主权受到外国控制，一贯拒绝美国的所谓“第四点计划”的援助。
    叙利亚参加了亚非会议，并同亚非国家一起为执行这个会议的决议而努力。
  近年来叙利亚政府加强了同苏联和人民民主国家的经济贸易交流。1955年5月，叙利亚和平代表团曾经访问了苏联。
    中华人民共和国成立以后，叙利亚和中国进行了友好的接触。1952年10月，叙利亚宗教领袖穆罕默德·阿契玛尔来我国参加了在北京举行的亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议。1954年9月，叙利亚邀请中国参加了大马士革国际博览会。
    亚非会议期间，中国和叙利亚代表团表达了加强两国经济合作和文化交流的愿望。1955年11月30日，叙利亚政府和我国政府在大马士革签订了贸易协定和支付协定，规定双方在对方首都设立商务代表处。1956年6月12日两国签订了文化合作协定。两国的友好往来也日益频繁。自1955年8月以来，叙利亚已有和平人士，国会议员以及法律工作者代表团等先后来我国访问。我国文化艺术代表团也在今年五月到叙利亚进行访问演出。为了加强中叙两国人民的友谊，叙利亚并且成立了叙中友好协会。1956年7月2日，叙利亚政府宣布承认中国，同中国建立外交关系。中、叙两国的友好关系进入了新的阶段。
