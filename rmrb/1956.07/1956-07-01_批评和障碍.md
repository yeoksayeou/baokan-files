    Criticism and Obstacles
    Sang Ke
    When discussing how to achieve "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend," some people list criticism as one of the obstacles.

    Well-written literary criticism is not only science but also literature; it can be said to be a "flower" in itself. Well-written academic criticism is itself a "school of thought," it is "contending." How can it be said to be an obstacle?

    Original works and theories often encounter unfair criticism when they first appear. After the publication of certain parts of Pushkin's "Eugene Onegin," they were criticized as "having no thought, no emotion, no picture worth seeing, a complete failure." Some critics even mocked him for not having studied Russian grammar. After the publication of Darwin's book on evolution, it not only aroused slanderous criticism from theologians. He sent his book to his former teacher and friend, a geologist, who also opposed it fiercely, returning the book to him and saying in a critical article that "he was leading wisdom down the path of decay." The storm of attacks caused Darwin to say in distress in a letter, "This can only be proven by time." Time proved it. These criticisms and attacks did no harm to the immortality of Pushkin and Darwin.

    Excellent literary works always arouse love and gratitude in the hearts of more and more readers. New scientific discoveries are always increasingly proven by objective facts. A writer or scientist who has self-awareness of the results of his hard work should be confident. The person who fears criticism is either because his product itself is too fragile to withstand any wind or rain, or because he himself lacks understanding of it.

    For conscious and mature writers and critics, criticism can never become an obstacle to their creation.

    So why do we oppose crude criticism, simplistic criticism?

    A stick cannot knock down a large tree, but it can destroy a sprout just emerging from the soil. Even more worrying is that crude and simplistic criticism can have very bad effects on society and can poison the minds and hearts of readers. Let us imagine such criticism: if you praise the countryside in a short poem, it accuses you of not reflecting industrial construction, and finally concludes that you have violated the general line. Even if you praise both the countryside and industrial construction in the poem at the same time, it still cannot satisfy this kind of critic. He will again accuse you of not explaining which is more important, agriculture or industry, and not explaining how they are related. In short, unless you don't write at all, he can always find fault with your work. Similar criticisms are not just in our imagination. This kind of criticism inevitably makes readers' minds closed and their hearts withered, thereby eliminating their ability to appreciate fresh, lively, and creative literature and art, and their ability to think about and distinguish between relatively complex academic issues.

    Only in this sense is bad criticism indeed an obstacle to the development of literature, art, and science. Because the advancement and prosperity of literature, art, and science cannot rely solely on the individual efforts of a few mature figures, but also on the massive growth of new forces, and, most importantly, on the acceptance, understanding, love, and support of the broad masses of society for them.

    批评和障碍
    桑珂
    谈到怎样实现“百花齐放，百家争鸣”的时候，有人把批评也列为障碍之一。
    写得好的文艺批评，不仅是科学，而且是文学，也可以说本身就是一种“花”。写得好的学术批评，本身就是一“家”，就是“争鸣”。怎么能说它们是障碍呢？
    有独创性的作品和学说，最初出现的时候，常常是遭受到不公正的批评的。普希金的“欧根·奥?金”的某些部分出版以后，曾经被批评为“没有一点思想，没有一点情感，没有一幅画面值得一看，一个完全的失败”。甚至曾有批评家嘲笑他没有学过俄文文法。达尔文关于进化论的著作出版以后，不仅引起了神学家们的诽谤性的批评。他把他的著作寄给过去的老师和朋友、一个地质学家，这个科学家也反对得非常激烈，把书退还了他，并且在批评文章中说“他把智慧推向了糜烂之途”。暴风雨般的攻击使得达尔文在一封信里苦恼地说：“这只有等待时间来证明了。”时间果然证明了。这些批评和攻击完全无损于普希金和达尔文的不朽。
    优美的文学作品总是在越来越多的读者的心灵中激起了热爱和感谢。科学上的新发现总是日益为客观的事实所证明。一个对于自己的辛勤的劳动的结果具有自知之明的文学家或科学家，应该是有自信的。畏惧批评的人，不是他的产品本身过于脆弱，经不起一点风吹雨打，就是他自己对于它太缺乏认识。
    对于自觉的成熟的文学家和批评家，批评决不能成为他们的创造的障碍。
    那么我们为什么又反对粗暴的批评，简单的批评呢？
    棍子打不倒大树，然而它却可以毁坏新从土里长出来的幼芽。更可忧虑的是粗暴的简单的批评可以在社会上发生很坏的作用，可以毒害读者的头脑和心灵。我们不妨设想有这样的批评：如果你在一首短诗里歌颂了农村，它就责备你没有反映工业建设，而且最后作出这样的结论：你违反了总路线。甚至你就是在诗里同时歌颂了农村和工业建设，也仍然不能使这种批评家满意。他又会责备你没有说明农业和工业何者第一重要，没有说明它们之间的关系如何。总之，除非你根本不写，否则他总有办法找出你的作品的毛病来。类似这样的批评并非仅仅存在于我们的想像中。这种批评必然使读者头脑闭塞，心灵枯萎，从而消灭了他们对于新鲜活泼的富有创造性的文学艺术的欣赏能力，对于比较复杂的学术问题的思考能力和辨别能力。
    只有在这样的意义上，坏的批评才的确是文学艺术和科学的发展的一种障碍。因为文学艺术也好，科学也好，它们的前进和繁荣并不能仅仅依靠已经成熟的少数人物的个人的努力，还要依靠新的力量的大量的成长，而且尤其重要的，还要依靠社会上的广大群众对于它们的接受、理解、爱好和扶植。
