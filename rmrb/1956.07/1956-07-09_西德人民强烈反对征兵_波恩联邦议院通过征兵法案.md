Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, July 7th: Bonn dispatch: West German youth, who are most closely related to the conscription law passed by the West German Federal Parliament today, are unwilling to support this law. Various West German youth organizations have expressed opposition to this law.

The West German population's widespread opposition to the implementation of conscription is reflected in the attitudes of various parties and social groups towards the conscription law. Currently, in addition to the German Communist Party, those opposing the conscription law include: the German Social Democratic Party, the Free Democratic Party, the Refugee Party, the League for German Unity, Peace and Freedom, the All-German People's Party, and the Bavarian Party. In addition, the West German Trade Union Federation, which has six million members, also opposes the conscription law. The conscription law and the establishment of an army have also been strongly opposed by religious figures.

Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, July 7th: Bonn dispatch: After an all-night heated debate, the West German Federal Parliament passed the Adenauer government's conscription law on its third reading at dawn today, ending the longest and most tumultuous debate since the establishment of the Federal Parliament.

The third reading debate began yesterday and continued for a full day and night. In the final vote, the conscription law, which was opposed by the broad masses of West German residents, was passed with 270 votes in favor, 166 votes against, and 20 abstentions. The Social Democratic Party and the Refugee Party voted against, and the Free Democratic Party abstained. The Christian Democratic Union, the German Party, and the Free People's Party, which make up the government, voted in favor.

This bill will be submitted to the Federal Senate for discussion on July 20.
