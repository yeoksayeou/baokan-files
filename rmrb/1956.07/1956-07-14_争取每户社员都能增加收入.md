    Strive to Increase the Income of Every Commune Member Household
    Zhang Yuanzhen
    Ensuring that 90% of the commune members increase their income is a standard that should be grasped in the distribution of advanced cooperatives. However, it would be even better if we could strive to have more than 90% or even 100% of the commune members increase their income. The "May First" Agricultural Cooperative in Wuxiang County, Shanxi Province, has made a very good effort in this regard.
    Before the summer harvest, the Party branch of the "May First" Agricultural Cooperative discovered that some commune members were having their children drop out of school to participate in labor, and some were working desperately themselves. This phenomenon attracted the attention of the branch, and they promoted the management committee to calculate an account of income, expenditure, and distribution. They found that among the 410 households in the entire cooperative, 21 households, including Han Bingyan's, would have less income than last year, and 9 households would have very little increase in income. Those having their children drop out of school and working desperately were precisely some of these people. Based on this situation, the cooperative cadres focused on studying ways to ensure that commune members would increase production and not reduce it.
    The main methods they adopted were: to find ways to increase production further on the basis of the original increase in production; and to reduce expenditures further on the basis of the original expenditure plan. All commune members discussed and devised methods together. In terms of increasing production, they used wasteland to sow 180 mu of beans and other crops, estimating a yield of sixty jin per mu, for a total increase of more than 10,000 jin. In addition, they supported commune members in developing household side occupations, raising more pigs and chickens, etc. In terms of expenditure, they tried to save as much as possible and reduce deductions. For example, the original plan was for the public accumulation fund to account for 6% of the total income. After research, it was reduced to 5% on the principle of not hindering the development of production, which deducted 1,200 yuan less than the original. Administrative management fees were also more economical. This increased the distribution portion of the commune members by more than 2,000 yuan, enabling the nine households with little increase in income to also increase their income by more than 10%; among the twenty-one households with reduced income, eight households also did not experience a reduction.
    For the remaining households with reduced income, further solutions were provided through production arrangements. For some households with fewer and weaker laborers or fewer work points, they were given more opportunities to work. For example, Han Bingyan had high skills but weak physical strength. Generally, he could only do a maximum of 190 labor days throughout the year, which was not as good as the average commune member. Letting him do more technical work would increase his income compared to last year. Another example was Shi Shuiming, who was old and not strong in labor. Doing agricultural work could only earn him 30 labor days throughout the year, and his income was less than last year. Letting him herd sheep could earn him at least eighty labor days a year, and his income could increase by nine yuan compared to last year. Another method was to organize household side occupations to increase income. For example, Li Xiangwei was about to drop out of school due to insufficient income. The cooperative helped his mother raise two pigs and ten chickens, which could generate an income of forty yuan throughout the year. With some light labor and fifty work points earned by himself during the holidays, he could continue to study at school. After such careful calculation on a household-by-household basis and thinking of ways in many aspects, it could be guaranteed that the vast majority of commune members would increase their income. However, there were still eleven households that, although their income was not less than in previous years, still had difficulties in life. These households mostly belonged to the "Five Guarantees" households, and the cooperative decided to subsidize them to ensure their livelihood. In this way, those with less income increased it, those with reduced production did not reduce it, those who were worried were relieved, students who dropped out of school also returned to school, and every commune member actively worked, no longer worrying about reduced income.

    争取每户社员都能增加收入
    章元珍
    保证90％的社员增加收入，这是高级社分配中应该掌握的标准。可是，如果能争取到90％以上甚至100％的社员都增加收入，那就更好。山西武乡县“五一”农业社在这方面作了很好的努力。
    夏收之前，“五一”农业社的党支部，发现有些社员让孩子退学来参加劳动，有的自己拼命劳动。这现象引起支部的注意，他们就推动管委会算了一笔收入、支出、分配账，发现全社410户中，有韩丙炎等二十一户将要比去年减少收入，有九户增加收入很少。让孩子退学的，拼命劳动的，正是这些人中的一部分。社干部根据这种情况，着重研究了保证社员多增产不减产的办法。
    他们采取的主要办法是：在原来增产的基础上，再想办法增产；在原来开支计划的基础上，再减少开支。全体社员大家商量想办法，在增产上，利用荒地播种豆类等作物180亩，预计每亩产粮六十斤，共可增产一万多斤，此外，支持社员发展家庭副业，多养猪鸡等。在开支上，尽量做到多节约，少扣除。如原计划公积金占总收入的6％，经过研究，在不妨碍发展生产的原则下，降为5％，比原来少扣除了1，200元。行政管理费也更加节约。这样就使社员分配部分增加了二千多元，使九户增加收入不多的户，也能增加收入10％以上；减少收入的二十一户中，有八户也不减少了。
    对其余减少收入的户，从生产安排上再加以解决。对有些劳动力少而弱或工分少的户，多给他们做活的机会。如韩丙炎技术高体力弱，一般活全年最多做190个劳动日，赶不上一般社员，让他多做技术活，收入就可比去年增加。又如史水明年迈劳动不强，做农业活全年只能做30个劳动日，收入比去年减少，让他放羊，一年最少赚八十个劳动日，收入就可比去年增加九元。另一种办法是组织家庭副业增加收入。如李相维因收入太少要退学，社帮助他母亲喂二只猪十只鸡，全年即可收入四十元，再作些轻微劳动，他自己假期再做五十个工，这样他就能坚持在学校学习。经过这样逐户仔细计算，多方面想办法，可保证绝大多数社员增加收入，但是还有十一户虽不比往年减少收入，生活仍有困难。这些户多属于五保户，合作社决定补助他们，保证他们的生活。这样使收入少的增多了，减产的不减了，担心的安心了，退学的学生也重新回到学校，社员个个积极劳动，不再发愁减少收入了。
