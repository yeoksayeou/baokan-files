    Qingdao Sifang Locomotive and Rolling Stock Manufacturing Plant
    Takes Many Measures to Cool Down
    (Reported by our newspaper) This year, Qingdao Sifang Locomotive and Rolling Stock Manufacturing Plant has added and repaired 46 cooling equipment units, which have begun to function. In the steel mill, since the water-cooled furnace doors were installed on the steel furnaces, the temperature in front of the furnace doors has decreased. The newly opened 200-square-meter movable windows in the machine shop provide excellent ventilation. Outside the high-temperature forging workshop, a large mat shed was specially built for workers to eat and cool off.
    Starting in June, this factory also provides health milk to workers working in high temperatures. The cooling drinks prepared by the factory's health station are very popular among the workers. Recently, preparations are being made to prepare cooling drinks without citric acid for workers with stomach problems.

    青岛四方机车厂
    采取许多措施降温
    本报讯　青岛四方机车车辆制造厂今年增添和检修的四十六台降温设备，已开始发挥作用。在钢场里，自从做好钢炉的串水炉门以后，炉门前的温度降低了。机械车间新开的二百平方公尺的活动窗，通风效果很好。在高温的锻冶车间外面，专门为工人搭起一个大席棚，工人们可以在这里吃饭，乘凉。
    从六月份开始，这个厂还供给在高温下工作的工人保健牛奶。厂里保健站配制的清凉饮料，很受工人欢迎。最近还准备为有胃病的工人配制没有柠檬酸的清凉饮料。
