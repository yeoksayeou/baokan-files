Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 30th -- An Okinawa delegation representing the will of 800,000 Okinawa residents petitioned the U.S. Far East Command and the U.S. Embassy in Japan on June 29th, opposing the U.S. further requisitioning and long-term occupation of residents' land to expand military bases on Okinawa.

The delegation presented the following four principles regarding the solution of military land issues on behalf of the Okinawa residents to these U.S. military and diplomatic institutions: oppose the expansion of land requisition; oppose the so-called one-time payment of rent, which is a disguised form of forced requisition of land at low prices; increase the rent for land that has already been requisitioned; and compensate for the losses of land that has already been requisitioned.

According to Anri, the head of the delegation, General Strickler, Chief of Staff of the U.S. Far East Command, stated in the meeting that the United States did not want to acquire ownership of Okinawa land, and if local residents firmly opposed it, the United States only wanted to obtain land use rights. As for the residents' opposition to the one-time payment of land rent, the Major General only stated that specific consultations could be held locally.

Anri said: The people of Okinawa "love their land, and it cannot be bought and sold easily with money as the United States intends."

The Okinawa delegation also went to the headquarters of the Liberal Democratic Party of Japan today to request this ruling party to assist in resolving the Okinawa land issue. Nobusuke Kishi, Secretary-General of the Liberal Democratic Party, stated that the Liberal Democratic Party fully supports the demands of the Okinawa residents and will lobby the government. Yesterday, at the suggestion of the Socialist Party, the Liberal Democratic Party agreed to jointly establish a joint council for countermeasures to the Okinawa issue.

While the Okinawa delegation was petitioning in Tokyo, about eight hundred people of Okinawa origin and people from all walks of life in Kanagawa Prefecture held a meeting in Yokohama on June 28th, resolving to crush the U.S. plan and strive for the early return of the Ryukyu Islands, currently occupied by the United States, to Japan. On the same day, in Kagoshima City, Kyushu, Okinawa expatriates also held a similar protest rally. They passed a resolution to Prime Minister Hatoyama, Foreign Minister Shigemitsu, and the Ryukyu government opposing the U.S. plan, and held a demonstration in the city.

At the request of the Okinawa representatives, Japanese Foreign Minister Shigemitsu Mamoru held two meetings with U.S. Ambassador to Japan Allison on the Okinawa land issue. During the talks, Shigemitsu conveyed the demands of the Okinawa people to Allison. However, he also explained to Allison that Japan was not opposing the U.S. right to maintain military bases in Okinawa, but rather requested that the United States adopt a "flexible and accommodating" attitude towards the Okinawa land issue.

    冲绳岛居民请愿和游行示威
    坚决反对美军霸占土地扩建军事基地
    新华社30日讯　东京消息：代表八十万冲绳岛居民意志的冲绳代表团六月二十九日到远东美军司令部和美国驻日大使馆请愿，反对美国在冲绳岛进一步强征和长期霸占居民的土地来扩建军事基地。
    代表团向这两个美国军事和外交机构提出了冲绳岛居民关于解决军用土地问题的四项原则：反对扩大征用土地；反对变相地以低价强征土地的所谓一次付清租金；增加已被征用土地的租金；赔偿已被征用土地的损失。
    据代表团长安里说，远东美军司令部参谋长斯特里克勒在会谈中表示，美国不想取得冲绳岛土地的所有权，如果当地居民坚决反对，美国只想取得土地使用权。至于居民反对一次付清土地租金问题，这位少将只表示可以在当地具体协商。
    安里说：冲绳岛人民“热爱他们的土地，它不能像美国打算的那样，轻而易举地用金钱来买卖”。
    冲绳岛代表团在今天又到日本自由民主党总部，要求这个执政的政党协助解决冲绳岛的土地问题。自由民主党干事长岸信介表示，自由民主党完全支持冲绳岛居民的要求，并且要向政府进行活动。自由民主党昨天在社会党的建议下，已经同意两党共同成立一个冲绳问题对策联合协议会。
    当冲绳代表团在东京请愿的时候，在神奈川县的约八百个冲绳籍人和日本各界人士六月二十八日在横滨举行大会，决议要粉碎美国的计划和争取早日使目前美国占领的琉球群岛重归日本。在同一天，在九州的鹿儿岛市，冲绳岛侨民也举行了同样的抗议集会。他们通过了向首相鸠山、外务相重光和琉球政府的一项反对美国计划的决议，并且在市内举行了示威游行。
    在冲绳岛代表们的要求下，日本外务相重光葵同美国驻日大使艾利逊就冲绳岛土地问题举行了两次会谈。在会谈中，重光向艾利逊转达了冲绳岛人民的要求。但是，他又向艾利逊解释说，日本不是要反对美国在冲绳岛保有军事基地的权利，而是要求美国对冲绳岛土地问题采取一种“有伸缩性的、能够通融的”态度。
