Xinhua News Agency Report:
Wuhan Iron and Steel Works Construction Site Needs to Strengthen Heatstroke Prevention Work
By Xinhua News Agency reporter Feng Jian: The most arduous period of construction during the summer heat has arrived. On the thermometer at the Wuhan area capital construction site, the red mercury column is steadily rising, already exceeding 100 degrees Fahrenheit at noon. In the vast construction area of the Wuhan Iron and Steel United Enterprise, construction workers are braving the scorching sun to carry out various preparatory works before formal construction. However, here, heatstroke prevention work is far from adequate.

In the vast open-air construction site, the sun is scorching and oppressive, and there are very few shaded shelters for workers to rest. Most construction sites have an insufficient supply of heatstroke prevention drinks, or have not even started supplying them. Conditions are even worse on heavy construction machinery. At the plant area leveling site, from around 10:00 AM onwards, the bodies of the excavators are baked until they are scorching hot, with the maximum temperature of the driver's cab sometimes rising to 120 degrees Fahrenheit. However, the drivers have taken off their thick canvas work clothes but have not yet received single-layer work clothes. The earthwork engineering company here plans to put sunshades and install ventilating fans on the excavators, but the plan has not yet become a reality.

The reporter made a special visit during two noontimes to the Wuhan Thermal Power Plant construction site, which is under the responsibility of the Second Engineering Company of the Wuhan Metallurgical Chemical Construction General Company, a construction site where heatstroke prevention work is relatively well done in this construction area. The builders here told the reporter with satisfaction that the site leaders had already built temporary shower rooms for them, purchased a large number of bathtubs, and delivered drinks and medicines for relieving heat and preventing malaria to the site. However, this construction site has only one canteen, which is crowded with more than 3,000 people during meal times, exceeding the normal capacity by more than double. The five reed mat rest sheds prepared by the construction site for the builders are also very small, damp, and not ventilated, so the workers are reluctant to go there. Some of the heatstroke prevention and cooling plans formulated by this construction site are still on paper.

Now, the Wuhan Metallurgical Chemical Construction General Company has decided to allocate a sum of money to build a batch of cool sheds and purchase a batch of bathtubs, tea sets, mosquito nets, and public electric fans for each construction site, and has held a meeting to arrange this work. Although this work has been grasped somewhat late, as long as it no longer remains on paper and in meetings, and each construction site can take urgent action to quickly turn the plan into reality, it is not too late.

    武钢工地需要加强防暑工作
    据新华社讯　新华社记者冯健报道：一年一度的最艰苦的伏暑天施工季节已经来临，武汉地区基本建设工地寒暑表上的红色水银柱节节上升，中午时分已经进到华氏一百度以上。在宽阔的武汉钢铁联合企业建筑地区里，建筑大军正冒着烈日，为正式施工前的各项准备工程进行施工。但是，在这里，防暑工作却是做得很不够的。
    辽阔的露天施工现场，太阳炎热逼人，工地上很少供工人休息的遮荫凉棚。大部分工地防暑饮料供应数量少，甚至还没有开始供应。在重型施工机械上，条件更差些。在厂区平土工地，从上午十点多钟以后，成群的挖土机机身便被晒得滚烫，驾驶台最高温度有时上升到华氏一百二十度。但是，驾驶员们脱掉了厚帆布工作服，至今还领不到单工作服。这里的土方工程公司，计划在挖土机上搭上遮阳罩棚和安装通风电扇，但是，计划至今还没有变成现实。
    记者特地利用两个中午，访问了这个建筑地区防暑工作做得较多的工地——武汉冶金化学建筑总公司第二工程公司负责施工的武汉热电厂工地。这里的建筑者们满意地对记者谈到：工地领导方面已经为他们搭建了临时淋浴室，购买了大批澡盆，解暑防疟的饮料和药品也送到了现场。但是，这个工地上仅有一个食堂，开饭的时候拥塞着三千多人，超过正常容量一倍多。工地为建筑者们准备的五间芦席休息棚，也很狭小，潮湿，不透风，工人们不愿去。这个工地制定的防暑降温计划，有一些还停留在纸上。
    现在，武汉冶金化学建筑总公司已经决定拨出一笔钱，为各工地搭建一批凉棚和购置一批澡盆、茶具、蚊帐和公用电扇，并且开会布置了这项工作。这个工作虽然抓得已经晚了一些，但是只要不再停留在纸上和会议上，各工地能紧急行动起来，把计划迅速变成现实，还是不算太晚的。
