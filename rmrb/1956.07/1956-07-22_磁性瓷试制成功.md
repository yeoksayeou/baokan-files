Xinhua News Agency, July 21st: A new type of magnetic porcelain, which can be used to manufacture memory systems for high-speed digital electronic computers, has recently been successfully trial-produced at the Railway Science Research Institute of the Ministry of Railways. This magnetic porcelain can also be used as a material for manufacturing contactless relays and ferromagnetic amplifiers for automatic control equipment.

This magnetic porcelain was successfully trial-produced by Fu Bosheng, assistant researcher at the Railway Science Research Institute, and his assistants Bai Lianru and Sun Yihuan after painstaking research over the past six months. Preliminary test results show good performance. They are now further researching small-scale production of this magnetic porcelain, preparing to apply it to China's railway signaling and communications.

    磁性瓷试制成功
    据新华社21日讯　一种新型的可以用来制造快速数字电子计算机记忆系统的磁性瓷，最近在铁道部铁道科学研究院试制成功。这种磁性瓷还可作为制造自动控制设备的无接点继电器、铁磁放大器的材料。
    这种磁性瓷，是铁道科学研究院助理研究员傅柏生和他的助手白琏如、孙以桓在最近半年内经过刻苦钻研，试制成功的。初步试验结果，性能良好。现在，他们正进一步作小批生产这种磁性瓷的研究，准备应用到我国铁道信号和通讯方面。
