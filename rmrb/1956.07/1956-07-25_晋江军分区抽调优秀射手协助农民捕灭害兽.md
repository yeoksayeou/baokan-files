    Jinjiang Military Sub-district Draws Excellent Shooters
    To Assist Farmers in Catching and Eliminating Pest Animals
    (Our dispatch) Quanzhou City, Fujian Province, recently exhibited a batch of animals such as leopards, goats, wild boars, porcupines, and pangolins. These animals were captured by a group of excellent shooters from the Jinjiang Military Sub-district of the Chinese People's Liberation Army in the dense forests of the Wuyi Mountains.
    Farmers in Anxi, Yongchun, Dehua, and Xianyou counties in Fujian Province have suffered greatly from wild animals. Therefore, the Jinjiang Military Sub-district, in conjunction with local authorities, formed a pest control command and drew upon excellent shooters to form a hunting team of more than 80 people to go deep into the high mountains and dense forests to catch and eliminate harmful animals.
    Treading through thorns, the hunting team members carefully searched for the footprints of wild animals in the dense forests. They extensively mobilized the masses and adopted methods such as tiger cages, suspended poles, traps, and monkey cages to eliminate many harmful animals. In just over a month, they captured and killed a total of 102 harmful animals of various kinds. The "August First Film Studio" of the General Political Department of the People's Liberation Army also sent a filming crew to the site to shoot a short documentary called "Eliminating Pests in the Deep Mountains."

    晋江军分区抽调优秀射手
    协助农民捕灭害兽
    本报讯　福建省泉州市最近展览了一批金钱豹、山羊、山猪、豪猪和穿山甲等动物，这些动物是中国人民解放军晋江军分区一批优秀射手在武夷山脉的密林中捕获的。
    福建的安溪、永春、德化和仙游四个县的农民遭受野兽的危害很大。因此晋江军分区协同当地机关组成除害指挥部，并抽调优秀射手组成一支八十多人的打猎队，深入高山密林中捕灭害兽。
    打猎队员们踏着荆棘，在密林中仔细地寻觅野兽的脚印。他们广泛发动了群众，并且采用了虎橱、吊杆、陷阱和猴笼等办法消灭了很多害兽。一个多月以来，他们共捕获和打死各种害兽102只。解放军总政治部“八一电影制片厂”还专门派了拍摄组，到现地拍摄了一部叫“深山除害”的纪录短片。
