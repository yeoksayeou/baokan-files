Xinhua News Agency Report: A new summer sanatorium in Lüda, specifically for workers to rest by the sea on their days off, began receiving guests on the 15th of this month. The first group to spend their Sunday here were the two hundred-plus builders of this very sanatorium.

　　The sanatorium is built in the famous seaside scenic area – Xinghai Park. It has outdoor lounges, bedrooms, recreation halls, and reading rooms, as well as a small shop for the convenience of guests. The outdoor lounge, consisting of forty-four colorful umbrella-shaped canopies, faces the blue sea. Under each canopy are tables and chairs, where vacationers can chat, dine, and play various interesting games, and also watch the sunrise and sunset.

　　This summer sanatorium was built with funds allocated by the Lüda Federation of Trade Unions. Each vacationer can spend one day and one night here, and only needs to pay half of their own food costs for one day. The sanatorium can accommodate more than two hundred guests every day. This summer, the sanatorium will receive more than fourteen thousand workers who come for rest and recuperation.
