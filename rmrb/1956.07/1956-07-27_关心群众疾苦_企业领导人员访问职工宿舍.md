    Caring About the Suffering of the Masses
    Enterprise Leaders Visit Employee Dormitories
    (Our Kunming Dispatch) Recently, leaders from some enterprises in Yunnan Province formed visiting groups to go deep into employee dormitories to understand the employees' living conditions, thoughts, and opinions and demands regarding the leadership of factories and mines.
    The leaders of the Kunming Electric Power Bureau visited more than sixty employee families and found that some employees' family housing was small, poorly lit, and lacked ventilation; some employees had three generations living in one room; some employees had many children and low incomes, and had difficulty making ends meet. Female employees generally requested the establishment of nurseries. These problems had not previously attracted the attention of the leadership, and nearly 250,000 yuan of the nearly 300,000 yuan of enterprise reward funds received over the years had been accumulated. After this visit, they held a meeting to study and propose solutions. Sixteen households in urgent need of assistance have now received subsidies; the problem of repairing old houses has also begun to be resolved, and the construction of new employee housing and nurseries is being planned.
    The leaders of the Kunming Smelter visited single dormitories and sick employees. They found that many single employees did not have mosquito nets; sick employees could not go to the cafeteria to eat, and no one brought them food; early and night shift employees slept in the same dormitory, which affected each other's sleep. After the visit, the factory's leadership instructed the welfare, health care, and labor wage departments to solve these problems. (Attached picture)
    The Dalian Municipal Federation of Trade Unions has established a one-day, one-night holiday sanatorium, which has now begun to receive guests. Vacationers can spend their holidays pleasantly by swimming, boating, or taking a motorboat tour of the seaside according to their interests.
    The first group of holiday sanatorium vacationers are dining under the pergola.

    关心群众疾苦
    企业领导人员访问职工宿舍
    本报昆明电　云南省部分企业的领导人员，最近组成访问小组，深入职工宿舍进行访问，了解职工的生活和思想情况以及对厂矿企业领导方面的意见和要求。
    昆明电业局的领导人员访问了六十多户职工家庭，发现有些职工家属的住房狭小、光线很暗，空气不流通，有的职工三代同住一房；有的职工子女多，收入少，生活有困难。女职工普遍要求举办托儿所。这些问题在以前并没有引起领导方面的重视，几年来得到的近三十万元企业奖励基金，就积压了近二十五万元。在这次访问以后，他们开会研究，提出了解决的办法。现在已经有十六户急待补助的困难户得到了补助；旧房屋的修缮问题也开始解决，新建职工住宅和托儿所的问题正在筹划。
    昆明冶炼厂的领导人员访问了单身宿舍和有病的职工。发现许多单身职工没有蚊帐；有病的职工不能去食堂吃饭，也没有人给他们送饭；早班和夜班职工睡在一个宿舍里，互相影响睡眠。访问后，工厂的领导方面已经责成福利、保健、劳动工资等部门着手解决这些问题。（附图片）
    旅大市工会联合会举办了为期一日一夜的假日休养院，现在已经开始接待客人。休养人员可以按着自己的兴趣，去游泳、划船或是乘汽艇游览海滨来愉快地度过假日。
    假日休养院第一批休养员们在凉棚下用餐。
