A Rural Opinion:

	Is it the Head of the Investigation Team, or the Head of the Fishing Team?
	In the Yuanchun Agricultural Production Cooperative of Anguang Township, Beijiao District, Tianjin, more than 2,000 catties of fish fry were raised in a large pit to develop sideline production. The cooperative members all hoped to raise these fish well and increase their income. However, something unexpected happened!
	One day in March, the investigation team for economic conditions from the district came to Anguang Township. Liu Ning, the head of the work team, quickly discovered that there were fish in the pit. Without asking whether they had an owner or whether fishing was allowed, he immediately made a fishing rod and went to the pit to fish. He fished several times, and seeing that there were many fish, he simply bought a good fishing rod in the city and went to the pit to fish every day. Each time he fished, he could catch one or two catties; he ate as much as he caught.
	This behavior of damaging the cooperative's sideline production aroused dissatisfaction among the cooperative members. Some cooperative members, fearing that he would eat the fish for nothing, also began to catch fish. When the management committee of the cooperative stopped the members from catching fish, they questioned: Why can the head of the work team fish, but we cannot catch them?
	Liu Ning, as the head of the work team, not only did not help the agricultural cooperative develop sideline production, but also took the lead in destroying the cooperative's sideline production. It is hoped that the Beijiao District Committee of Tianjin Municipality will stop Liu Ning's bad behavior and reverse the negative impact caused among the masses. (Qiu Xiangyun)

### 是调查组长，还是钓鱼组长？

    是调查组长，还是钓鱼组长？
    天津北郊区安光乡园春农业生产合作社，为了发展副业生产，在一个大坑内养了二千多斤鱼苗。社员们都希望能把这些鱼养好，增加自己的收入。可是，料想不到的事情却发生了！
    在三月间的一天，区里的调查经济情况的工作组到了安光乡。工作组长刘宁很快地发现坑里有鱼。他也不问有无主人，是否允许钓鱼，马上做了个钓鱼杆，到坑边去钓。他连钓数次，看到鱼很多，索性到市内买了个好的钓鱼杆，每天到坑边去钓。每钓一次，总能钓到一至二斤；他是钓多少吃多少。
    这种损害合作社的副业生产的行为，引起了社员们的不满。有些社员怕他把鱼白白吃掉，也就动手捕起鱼来。当社的管理委员会制止社员捕鱼的时候，他们责问说：为什么工作组长能钓，我们就不能捕呢？
    身为工作组长的刘宁，不但没有帮助农业社发展副业生产，反而带头破坏社的副业生产。希望天津市北郊区委会制止刘宁的这种不良行为，挽回在群众中造成的恶劣影响。　（丘祥云）
