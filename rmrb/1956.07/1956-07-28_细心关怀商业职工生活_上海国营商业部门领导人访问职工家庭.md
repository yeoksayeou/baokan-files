Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 26th. Leaders from the twenty-six specialized companies within the Shanghai First Commercial Bureau system, including managers, store directors, Communist Party and Communist Youth League branch secretaries, and union chairpersons, recently conducted a large-scale visit to the families of their employees. Over a period of more than half a month, they visited over eight thousand worker and private sector personnel households, gaining an in-depth understanding of the workers' living and welfare issues, and listening to their opinions on work, study, and other aspects.

During these visits, leaders of various companies discovered many problems that had not been identified before. For example, many workers had large families or family members who were ill, making their lives very difficult, but because they had not applied for subsidies, they could not receive assistance. Some workers had very poor housing conditions, making it impossible for them to rest and study properly at home. Some workers lived too far from their workplaces, resulting in great fatigue from their daily commutes. When leaders of the Municipal Chemical Raw Materials Company visited the family of female employee Zhang Lanzhen, they discovered that her husband was blind, and that she had to go to work at the store at 5:00 AM every day and could not return home until late, making it impossible for her to take care of her family. Chen Yuankang, a bill clerk at the Municipal Food and Sundries Company, was not very efficient in his work and often made mistakes. It was only during this visit that it was learned that this was not due to a lack of effort on his part, but rather that his brain had been injured by a serious illness, making him unsuitable for bill-clerk work. When the manager of the Changning District Wholesale Store of the Municipal Monopoly Enterprise Company visited Liu Tingzhao, an elderly worker, he discovered that he had worked diligently for three years, and none of the cigarettes he had been in charge of had become moldy, but not only had he not been rewarded, but he had also been regarded as old and useless by the past store director.

Problems discovered during the visits that could be solved were immediately resolved. According to preliminary statistics from twelve companies, during these visits, over 100,000 yuan in subsidies has already been distributed to 4,364 workers with financial difficulties. Inappropriate job assignments for individual workers have been adjusted. The Trade Trust Company has allocated housing for seven workers. The Pharmaceutical Company accepted workers' suggestions and established a patient dormitory and expanded the nutrition cafeteria. Some companies are trying to relocate workers who live too far from their workplaces.

After the visits by company leaders, many workers and their families wrote letters to the companies expressing their gratitude. Chen A'quan, a technician at the Trade Trust Company, said in a letter: "Comrades brought the subsidies in heavy rain, which moved my whole family. My 83-year-old mother repeatedly urged me to work hard."

    细心关怀商业职工生活
    上海国营商业部门领导人访问职工家庭
    新华社上海26日电　上海市第一商业局系统二十六个专业公司的经理、商店主任、共产党和青年团的支部书记、工会主席，最近作了一次大规模的职工家庭访问工作。他们以半个多月的时间，一共访问了八千多户职工和私方人员的家庭，对职工们的生活福利问题作了一次深入的了解，并且听取了职工们对工作、学习等方面的意见。
    在这次访问中，各公司领导人员都发现了许多以前所没有发现的问题。例如，不少职工家中子女多或家属生病，生活十分困难，但因他们没有申请补助，不能得到照顾；有的职工住宅条件很坏，在家中无法很好休息和学习；有的职工住地离工作地点太远，每天往返十分疲劳。市化工原料公司领导人在访问女工作人员张兰珍的家庭时，发现她的丈夫是个双目失明的人，她平日早上五点多钟就要去商店工作，晚上才能回家，无法照顾家庭。市食品杂货公司开单员陈远康平时工作效率不高，经常出差错，这次访问中才知道并非他工作不努力，而是他的大脑曾因重病受伤，不适宜做开单工作。市专卖事业公司长宁区批发商店经理在访问老年职工刘廷昭时，发现他三年来勤恳工作，保管的卷烟没有霉坏一支，但他不仅没有得到奖励，而且还被过去的店主任视为老而无用的人。
    访问中所发现的问题，能解决的已经当即解决。据十二个公司的初步统计，在这次访问中，已经发给四千三百六十四个生活困难的职工十万多元补助金。个别职工工作不适当的已经设法调整。贸易信托公司为七个职工调配了房屋。医药公司接受职工意见，设立了病员宿舍，并且扩大了营养食堂。有的公司对住家离工作地点太远的职工，正在设法掉换他们的工作地点。
    各公司领导人员访问以后，许多职工和他们的家属写信给公司表示感谢。贸易信托公司技工陈阿泉在信中说：“同志们冒大雨把补助金送来，使我全家都十分感动，八十三岁的老母亲再三叮嘱我，要我好好工作。”
