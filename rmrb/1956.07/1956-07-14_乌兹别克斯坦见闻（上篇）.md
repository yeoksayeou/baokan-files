    Glimpses of Uzbekistan (Part 1)
    By Our Correspondent in the Soviet Union, Li He
          Neighbors Though Far Apart
    We visited Uzbekistan for a few days, as guests in this advanced Soviet Socialist Republic in Central Asia. The beautiful southern scenery, the thriving construction, and especially the warm friendship of the people there for Chinese friends, are deeply and vividly etched in our memory.
    Arriving in Uzbekistan feels like being next door to Xinjiang. Although one must cross the Tianshan Mountains and the Kyrgyz Republic to reach southern Xinjiang, when I was in Tashkent, the capital of Uzbekistan, I seemed to hear the camel bells of Kashgar in southern Xinjiang. At the Republic's Academy of Sciences, Uzbek historian Shevkin enthusiastically showed us two Wuzhu coins and several ancient Chinese mirrors discovered within the Republic's borders. In Samarkand, a history professor excitedly told us that historical materials still preserved prove that as early as the fourth century, a woman living in this ancient city corresponded with her daughter living in southern Xinjiang. This Uzbek comrade cherishes this friendship between our peoples that began long ago, making me feel that two ancient countries, once separated by vast distances, have become neighbors seemingly just a stone's throw away.
    Like the Uyghur people of Xinjiang, the people of Uzbekistan maintain the traditional custom of hospitality: offering freshly baked, fragrant naan, serving shiny pilaf cooked by themselves, and singing majestic and passionate folk songs. When parting, they present an embroidered skullcap with four corners and, to the most respected friends, drape a national costume of red and green wide stripes with a yellow sash. We also accepted this irresistible hospitality. The naan, as big as a gong, is baked by sticking the dough on the inner wall of the oven. The naan of Samarkand is very famous and can be preserved for a long time. When Nehru visited there, people gave him a lot of naan. When we visited a rural village near Samarkand, people also gave us naan as souvenirs. Pilaf is made by stir-frying mutton with red and yellow carrots, adding rice and raisins. This is the most precious national dish of the Uzbeks. Even if you are full, you should eat a few spoonfuls, just like when a Kazakh friend serves a cooked sheep's head, you have to cut off a piece of sheep's ear or sheep's nose meat to taste it, otherwise you will be neglecting the host. When I was gnawing on naan, tasting pilaf, especially when watching male and female members of a collective farm near Tashkent dance the Uzbek dance in perfect harmony with their necks, fingers, eyes, steps… and listening to them sing melancholy or cheerful lyrical songs, I felt like I had returned to Xinjiang, returned to my motherland.
      The Fruits of Writing Reform
    In our Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, there are Uzbeks, and in Uzbekistan, there are also Uyghurs. The cultures and languages of the two groups are very similar. In the fields of Tashkent, we met two eleven or twelve-year-old Uzbek children with thick eyebrows and dark faces. I said to them: "Salom (Greetings)," "Yaxshi (Good)," and they started chatting with you with a smile. They can all speak fluent Russian. The phenomenon encountered in other Soviet republics was also seen here. Here, more than one million children receive compulsory education, and they can generally speak their own language and Russian.
    Here we see another reasonable phenomenon. The Republic publishes "Red Uzbekistan Newspaper" in Uzbek and "Pravda Vostoka" in Russian. Both are the central organs of the Communist Party of Uzbekistan. The former has a circulation of 180,000 copies, and the latter 150,000 copies. Later, in Kazakhstan, we also saw two official newspapers published in Kazakh and Russian. All Union Republics, Autonomous Republics, and Autonomous Regions in the Soviet Union publish two newspapers. The editorial departments of the two newspapers often work in the same building, but they are independent, each with its own staff and work plan. This has cultivated a large number of national political and cultural workers. In Tashkent, we met many outstanding Uzbek and other ethnic newspaper workers. Now the entire Republic has 181 newspapers and 46 magazines, with a circulation of 1.3 million copies, mainly published in Uzbek.
    Comrade Rakhimov, the editor-in-chief of "Red Uzbekistan Newspaper," visited China in 1954 with a delegation of Soviet journalists and became friends with us at first sight. He sent his newspaper every day. The newspaper uses the Uzbek language in Russian letters. After the October Revolution, the Uzbek script underwent two reforms. This is an important part of the Uzbek cultural revolution. Long before the Arabs entered Central Asia, the Khwarazmian and Sogdian scripts had existed here for a long time. Later, the Arabic script gradually replaced the original scripts of Central Asia. The Arabic script could not accurately express the pronunciation of the Uzbek language. There are many similar consonants in the Arabic script, which are difficult for people who do not speak Arabic to distinguish. There are also more vowels in Central Asian languages than in Arabic. Therefore, although the people of Central Asia used the Arabic script for many centuries, they still felt it difficult and inconvenient. Shortly after the October Revolution, research was conducted on various Uzbek dialects and vernaculars. Many survey teams were organized to investigate languages in urban and rural areas. In 1922, a preliminary improvement was made to the Arabic script, adding vowel symbols and eliminating consonant symbols that did not exist in the Uzbek language. The problem was not solved. Then the Latinized New Script was adopted. In 1926, a national and local New Script Committee was organized to promote the Latinized New Script movement. In 1928, magazines and weekly newspapers in the New Script were published. The promotion of the New Script was opposed by some conservative elements. In 1928, in the Ashak area, some rich peasants and religious figures attempted to burn down the village school and kill the teachers because they were teaching the New Script. However, the New Script rapidly became popular with socialist construction. On December 1, 1929, it was first used in institutions and social organizations. On November 7, 1930, the entire Republic used it. The Latinized New Script greatly facilitated the people's literacy and improved culture. Ten years later, after a year and a half of preparation, the Russian alphabet was adopted throughout the Republic from 1942. This change played a great role in strengthening the ties between Uzbekistan and Russia and other brotherly republics. Because there are many words in Uzbek that come from Russian and other Soviet national languages, and these foreign words are increasing day by day. After switching to the Russian alphabet, children only need to learn one alphabet.
          National Flowers
    "How many literate residents were there in Uzbekistan before the October Revolution?"
    "Only 2%."
    "Were there any universities?"
    "No."
    "And now?"
    "Now illiteracy has been eliminated. There are thirty-five universities and one hundred secondary technical schools. There is an Academy of Sciences, including twenty-five research institutions and six hundred and fifty scientific staff."
    This is our conversation with people in Tashkent. At the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Uzbekistan, people told us that now the first secretary of each district party committee in the entire Republic is Uzbek, not to mention the state, city, and central committees. This is very reasonable and reflects the growth of national cadres. In this Republic, Uzbeks are the most numerous, accounting for 65%, Russians account for 11%, and there are also Tajiks, Kazakhs, Karakalpaks, Tatars, Kyrgyz, Jickmans, Uyghurs, Ukrainians, Koreans, etc. In the Kaganovich Collective Farm near Tashkent, with a population of four thousand, there are eleven nationalities, and they get along like brothers.
    In this collective farm, female members of the amateur cultural entertainment group performed to their hearts' content in front of us in the presence of their husbands. The feudal customs of Uzbekistan in the old days have completely disappeared. These customs did not allow women to show their faces. When women went to the streets, they had to lower their veils and wrap their whole bodies in shawls, not even allowing their arms to be exposed. Now women have become active builders of Uzbekistan. Sixteen women have been elected as representatives to the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, and 167 women have been elected as representatives to the Soviets of the Uzbek Republic and the Karakalpak Autonomous Republic. There are four hundred female doctors and associate doctors in the entire Republic. In order to strengthen women's work, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Uzbekistan has a women's department. Rakhim Pabayeva, one of the secretaries of the CPC Central Committee, visited India, Burma, and Afghanistan with Khrushchev and Bulganin. She herself is a sign of the growth of female cadres in Uzbekistan. She told us: "Generally speaking, the problem of training national cadres in the Uzbek Republic has been solved. But we cannot be complacent. We still need to and should train more national cadres, especially talented cadres in the industrial sector."

    乌兹别克斯坦见闻（上篇）
    本报驻苏联记者　李何
          天涯若比邻
    我们在乌兹别克斯坦访问了几天，我们在这个中亚细亚先进的苏维埃社会主义共和国作了几天客。那里明媚的南国风光，那里繁荣的建设生活，特别是那里人们对中国朋友的亲热友情，深刻而鲜明地留在我们的记忆里。
    到了乌兹别克斯坦，好像到了新疆的隔壁。虽然要翻过天山和吉尔吉斯共和国才能到新疆南部，但是我在乌兹别克斯坦首都塔什干时候，仿佛已经听到南疆喀什一带的驼铃响声了。在共和国的科学院，乌兹别克历史学家谢吾金兴致勃勃地给我们看了在共和国境内发现的两枚五铢钱和几面中国古镜。在撒马尔罕，一位历史教授激动地告诉我们，现在保存的史料证明，远在第四世纪，住在这个古城的一位妇女就和住在南疆的她的女儿通信。这位乌兹别克同志珍视这个早已开始的我们人民之间的友谊，这使我感觉到在历史上曾是远隔天涯的两个古国今天却成为似乎相距不过咫尺的比邻了。
    像新疆的维吾尔族一样，乌兹别克斯坦人们保持着好客的传统习惯：端出自己烤的香喷喷的馕，摆上自己煮的油亮亮的抓饭，引吭高唱雄壮而热情的民歌，临别时候馈赠一顶绣花的瓜皮四角小帽，给最尊敬的朋友还披上一件腰缠黄巾的红绿宽条的民族服。我们也接受了这种难却的盛情。锣子大小的馕，是把面贴在炉子内壁烤熟的。撒马尔罕的馕很有名，可以保存很久。尼赫鲁访问那里，人们送他不少馕。我们访问撒马尔罕附近农村时候，人们也馈馕做纪念。抓饭是把羊肉和红黄萝卜炒过后加上大米和葡萄干煮成的。这是乌兹别克人最珍贵的民族饭。那怕你肚子很饱，也要吃几匙子，就像哈萨克朋友端上煮熟的羊头时候，你要用刀切下一块羊耳朵肉或者羊鼻子肉来尝尝一样，不然便是怠慢主人了。当我啃着馕，尝着抓饭，特别是在塔什干附近集体农庄看男女庄员脖子、手指、眼睛、脚步……全身动作合拍地跳着乌兹别克舞和听他们唱着抑郁或爽朗的抒情歌曲时候，我好像回到新疆，回到祖国了。
      文字改革的果实
    在我们新疆维吾尔自治区有乌兹别克族，在乌兹别克斯坦也有维吾尔族。两族的文化和语言很接近。在塔什干田野上，我们碰见两个十一二岁、浓眉黑脸的乌兹别克小孩子。我向他们说：“沙朗木（敬礼）”，“雅克西（好）”，他们笑吟吟地同你拉起话来，他们都能说一口流利的俄语。在苏联其他共和国遇到的现象，在这里也见到了。这里一百多万儿童受着义务教育，他们一般都能操本族语言和俄语。
    在这里我们看到另一个合理的现象。共和国有用乌兹别克文出版的“红色乌兹别克斯坦报”，用俄文出版的“东方真理报”。两者都是乌兹别克共产党中央机关报。前者发行十八万份，后者十五万份。后来，在哈萨克斯坦，我们也看到了以哈文和俄文出版的两种机关报。全苏联各个加盟共和国、自治共和国、自治州都出版两种报纸。两种报纸编辑部都常常在一座楼内办公，但是是独立的，各有自己的人员编制和工作计划。这样培养了大批民族的政治和文化工作人员。我们在塔什干，会见了许多乌兹别克和别族的优秀的报刊工作者。现在全共和国有181种报纸和46种杂志，发行130万份，主要是以乌兹别克文出版。
    “红色乌兹别克斯坦报”总编辑拉希莫夫同志1954年曾随同苏联报刊工作者代表团到过中国，和我们一见如故。他每天送来自己的报纸。报纸用的是俄文字母的乌兹别克语言。在十月革命以后，乌兹别克文字经过两次改革。它是乌兹别克文化革命的一个重要内容。远在阿拉伯人进入中亚细亚以前，这里长期存在过荷列兹马和索拉第字母。后来阿拉伯字母逐渐代替了中亚细亚原有的字母。阿拉伯字母不能准确地表达乌兹别克语言的发音。阿拉伯字母中有不少相近的子音，不通阿拉伯语言的人难以辨别。中亚细亚语言中母音又比阿拉伯语言中母音多。所以中亚细亚人民虽然使用阿拉伯字母许多世纪，仍然感到困难和不便。十月革命后不久，对乌兹别克各种方言和土话进行了研究。组织了许多考察队到城乡调查语言。在1922年对阿拉伯字作了初步的改良，补充了母音符号，取消了那些乌兹别克语言中没有的子音符号。问题没有解决。接着采用了拉丁化新文字。1926年组织了全国和地方新文字委员会推行拉丁化新文字运动。1928年出版了新文字的杂志和周报。新文字的推行受到了一部分保守分子的反对。1928年在阿沙克地方有富农和教徒企图烧毁村里的学校和杀死教员，因为他教授新文字。但是新文字随着社会主义建设迅速地普及了。1929年12月1日在机关和社会组织中首先使用了它。1930年11月7日全共和国都使用了它。拉丁化新文字极大地便利了人民的识字和提高文化。十年以后，经过一年半的准备，1942年起在全共和国改用了俄文字母。这一改变，对于加强乌兹别克斯坦和俄罗斯以及其他兄弟共和国的联系来说，起了很大作用。因为乌兹别克语中有不少来自俄罗斯语和苏联其他民族语的语汇，这些外来语还在一天天加多。改用俄文字母后，儿童学会一种字母就行了。
          民族的花朵
    “乌兹别克斯坦居民在十月革命前有多少识字的？”
    “只有2％。”
    “有没有大学？”
    “没有。”
    “而现在呢？”
    “现在文盲扫除了。有三十五个高等学校和一百个中等技术学校。有科学院，包括二十五个研究机关和六百五十个科学工作人员。”
    这是我们在塔什干同人们的谈话。在乌兹别克共产党中央委员会，人们告诉我们，现在全共和国每个区党委员会的第一书记都是乌兹别克人，州委、市委和中央更不必说了。这很合理，也反映了民族干部的成长。在这个共和国，乌兹别克人最多，占65％，俄罗斯人占11％，此外还有塔吉克人、哈萨克人、卡拉卡尔巴克人、塔塔尔人、吉尔吉斯人、吉克曼人、维吾尔人、乌克兰人、朝鲜族人等等。在塔什干附近四千人口的卡冈诺维奇集体农庄就有十一个民族，他们相处得如同兄弟。
    在这个集体农庄，参加业余文化娱乐小组的女庄员们当着自己丈夫在我们面前尽情地表演了。旧时代乌兹别克的封建风俗完全绝迹了。这种风俗不许妇女出头露面，妇女上街时候要垂下面纱，用披巾把全身裹得密密的，连臂也不让露出来。现在妇女已成为乌兹别克斯坦的积极建设者了。有十六个妇女被选为苏联最高苏维埃代表，167个妇女被选为乌兹别克共和国和卡拉卡尔巴克自治共和国苏维埃代表。全共和国有四百个女博士和女副博士。为了加强妇女工作，乌兹别克共产党中央委员会里设有妇女部。乌共中央书记之一拉希姆帕巴耶娃，曾经跟赫鲁晓夫、布尔加宁访问过印度、缅甸、阿富汗。她本身就是乌兹别克斯坦妇女干部成长的标志。她对我们说：“总的说来，乌兹别克共和国培养民族干部问题已经解决了。但是不能自满。还需要也应该培养更多的民族干部，特别是工业方面有才能的干部。”
