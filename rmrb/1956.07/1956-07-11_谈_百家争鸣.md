Without debates involving differing opinions, no science can develop. We want to march towards science in a big way, to catch up with the advanced world levels of science, and of course, we must develop our science quickly and greatly. Therefore, it is necessary to encourage those engaged in science to "speak their minds freely" and展开不同意见的争论，是必要的事情。The Party Central Committee's proposal of the policy of "Letting a Hundred Flowers Bloom and a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend" is correct and timely. The entire academic community has expressed warm support for this policy.

To have good contention, we must allow debaters to say things that are clearly different from, or even contrary to, the words and phrases of Marxist classics. Marxism is the enemy of dogmatism. What is important is the spirit and essence of Marxism, the viewpoints and methods of Marxism, and not the individual words and phrases in the Marxist classics. Lenin's disagreement with Marx's theory that socialism cannot be victorious in one country was completely correct; this has been proven by history. Of course, Marx once said that "bourgeois society is still on the rise" (in a letter to Engels in 1858). But even if Marx had not said this, would Lenin have considered the theory that socialism cannot be victorious in one country to be correct under all conditions? I think not. This familiar example needs no further explanation. Let me give an example of a question that has been frequently discussed in recent years, and which is related to the science I study (psychology), namely, whether there is thinking without language. The answer should be affirmative, that is, there is thinking without language. However, because Stalin answered Krasheninnikova by saying that "no matter what thoughts arise in the human mind, and when these thoughts arise, they can only arise and exist on the basis of linguistic material, in linguistic terms and phrases... Only idealists... can talk about thinking without language." Before Stalin's reply to comrades Belkin and Furer was published, anyone who gave an affirmative answer would be labeled as an idealist. In fact, we cannot conclude that anyone who believes that thinking is the function of the human brain reflecting reality is an idealist. Thinking in general normal people is inseparable from language, but deaf-mute adults can use their perception and imagery of things to think. (This is what Stalin later said in his reply to comrades Belkin and Furer). Perception and imagery are derived from matter, and believing that people can use perception and imagery to think does not make one an idealist. Of course, everyone knows that Stalin said in his reply to comrades Belkin and Furer that the thinking of deaf-mutes "is a completely different topic, which I have not talked about, and cannot talk about, because linguistics studies normal people who can speak, not abnormal deaf-mutes who cannot speak. You are replacing the topic being discussed with another topic that has not been discussed." Stalin's point on deaf-mutes is correct, but I think comrades Belkin and Furer had reason to raise this question. Because according to what Stalin said in his letter to Comrade Krasheninnikova, it would make people think that Stalin believed that there was absolutely no thinking without language. If Belkin and Furer did not raise the question of deaf-mutes, then Stalin's words could easily be interpreted as meaning that there is absolutely no thinking without language in the world, but the fact is not so. This shows that as long as we recognize the spirit and viewpoint of Marxism, we can say things that are different from what Marxist authorities have said. Stalin's intention was only to say that there is absolutely no thinking that is not based on some kind of activity of the human brain. Understanding this meaning, one can say that there is thinking without language without becoming an idealist.

In conclusion, we should not label people as idealists simply because they say things that are different from the words and phrases in the articles of Marxists. Our study of Pavlov's theory is no exception. If we do not violate Pavlov's scientific spirit, that is, even if we say things that are different from what Pavlov said, it is permissible. We should not easily call people who say things that are somewhat different from Pavlov but do not actually betray his scientific spirit "revisionists." On the contrary, revisionists are precisely dogmatists; they "buy the casket and return the pearl," abandoning the entire spirit of this genius scientist and stubbornly clinging to his fragmentary words. Stalin said: "What is the method of revisionists in quoting Marx? The method of revisionists in quoting Marx is to depart from the specific conditions of a certain era and extract some words from Marx's individual principles to replace Marx's viewpoint" (Stalin's Collected Works, Volume 9, page 80). In order to realize the policy of "Letting a Hundred Flowers Bloom and a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend," we must prevent ourselves from being infected with this "method" of revisionists. Only in this way can we make our science develop smoothly and rapidly.

    谈“百家争鸣”
    唐钺
    没有不同意见的争论，任何科学都是不可能发展的。我们要向科学大进军，要赶上世界科学先进水平，当然要把我们的科学快快地大大地加以发展。因此鼓励从事科学者“畅所欲言”地展开不同意见的争论，是必要的事情。党中央提出“百家争鸣”的方针是正确的，而且是及时的。全国学术界人士对这个方针都表示热烈的拥护。
    要好好争鸣，我们必须容许争论者说与马克思主义经典的词句显然不同，甚至相反的话。马克思主义是教条主义的敌人。要紧的是马克思主义的精神和实质，马克思主义的观点和方法，而不在于马克思主义经典中的个别词句。列宁对马克思的社会主义不能在一个国家内胜利的那个理论，提出不同的意见，是完全正确的；这是历史已经证明了的。固然马克思曾说过当时“资产阶级社会还在走上坡路”（1858年给恩格斯的信）这个话。可是就是马克思不曾说过这个话，列宁会不会认为社会主义不能在一国内胜利这个理论是不论在什么条件之下都对的呢？我想是不会的。这个大家熟悉的例，不必再解释了。我举个近年来常常讨论的，而且与我所学的这门科学（心理学）有关的问题，就是，有没有不用语言的思维这个问题。答复应该是肯定的，就是，有不用语言的思维。但因为斯大林回答克拉舍宁尼科娃说过“不论人的头脑中会产生什么样的思想，以及这些思想在什么时候产生，它们只有在语言的材料的基础上，在语言的术语和词句的基础上才能产生和存在……只有唯心主义者……才能谈到没有语言的思维。”在斯大林回答别尔金和富列尔两同志的信未发表以前作肯定答复的人就会被扣上唯心主义者的帽子。其实凡是相信思维是人脑反映现实的机能的人，我们都不能断定他是唯心主义者。思维在一般正常人固然离不开语言，但是聋哑的成年人可以用对事物的知觉和表象来进行思维。（这是斯大林后来在回答别尔金和富列尔两同志的信上说过的）。知觉，表象是物质派生的，相信人可以用知觉表象进行思维，并不是唯心主义者。当然大家都知道斯大林回答别尔金和富列尔两同志的信内说关于聋哑人的思维“这完全是另外一个题目，这个题目我没有讲到，也不能讲到，因为语言学所研究的是会讲话的正常的人，而非不正常的不会讲话的聋哑的人。你们是用另外一个未被讨论的题目来代替了被讨论的题目”。斯大林对聋哑人的论点是正确的，可是我认为别尔金和富列尔两同志是有理由提出这个问题的。因为据斯大林给克拉舍宁尼科娃同志的信内所说的话，是会使人认为斯大林以为完全没有不用语言的思维的。假如别尔金和富列尔不提出聋哑人的问题，那么，斯大林的话，很容易被解释为天下绝对没有不用语言的思维，而事实却不如此。这就说明只要我们认清马克思主义的精神，观点，就可以说与马克思主义权威人士所说的不相同的话。斯大林的意思不过说绝对没有不以人脑的某种活动作为其基础的思维罢了。了解了这个意思，就可以说有不用语言的思维而不因此变成唯心主义者。
    归结一句话，我们不要一听别人说与马克思主义者的文章中词句不同的话，就把人家扣上唯心主义者的帽子。我们学习巴甫洛夫学说的情形也不是例外。假如不违反巴甫洛夫的科学精神，就是说与巴甫洛夫所说的不同的话，也是可以的。我们不要轻易把说话与巴甫洛夫有些不同而实际不背他的科学精神的人叫作“修正派”。相反地，修正派正是教条主义者；他们“买椟还珠”，抛弃这个天才科学家的整个精神而死啃住他的片词只语。斯大林说：“修正派引证马克思的手法是什么呢？修正派引证马克思的手法就是离开一定时代的具体条件，从马克思的个别原理中引出一些话来顶替马克思的观点”（斯大林全集卷九，页八十）。为了实现“百家争鸣”的方针，我们一定要预防传染上这种修正派的“手法”。惟有这样，我们才能够使我们的科学顺利地迅速地发展。
