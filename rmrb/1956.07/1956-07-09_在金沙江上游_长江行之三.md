Upstream on the Jinsha River
A Yangtze Journey, Part 3
By Our Special Correspondent Fang Ji

I accompanied a survey team composed of Chinese water conservancy engineers and Soviet hydraulic experts, traveling upstream on the Yangtze River.

In the morning, the boat departed from a wharf in an upstream city, heading downstream. The sky had just begun to brighten, and a light mist was rising from the river surface. The clear waters of the Min River carried the small, clean passenger ship silently downstream.

“Before yesterday, we were still looking at tributary hubs; from today onward, we are on the main stream.”

Engineer Li, standing at the bow of the ship, said to a Soviet hydraulic general expert standing beside him. The expert merely nodded, without speaking. He seemed to be intently focused on something on the river surface.

This survey team had already traveled a great distance. They departed from Chengdu, first going to Guanxian, to visit the Dujiangyan Irrigation System, China’s greatest ancient water conservancy project—giving one the impression that, since our ancestors, under such conditions, were able to carve "Li Dui" to channel the Min River, and subdue the Mo River, irrigating the fertile fields of the western Sichuan plain for thousands of miles, making it the "Land of Abundance," then what is there that we cannot accomplish in our time?

Then, the survey team passed through Xinjin, Pengshan, Meishan, Jiajiang, and arrived at Leshan, observing the confluence of the Dadu River and the Min River. They then went to Wutong and Qianwei, inspecting two dam sites on tributary hubs, before arriving at this place where the Min River and the Jinsha River converge.

At this moment, the right bank suddenly opened up, revealing a patch of bright sky like colored satin. Simultaneously, the sound of rushing water grew louder, and the boat sailed towards the sound.

It could be seen that under that bright sky like colored satin, a cloud of orange-red mist like morning glow surged from a canyon, enveloping the surging, molten gold-like waters of the Jinsha River, with the force of ten thousand horses galloping, rushing into the Min River.

“Jinsha River!”

The expert suddenly exclaimed, pronouncing the words with a not entirely accurate accent. Clearly, this was what he had been waiting for.

“Now we’ve truly seen the Yangtze River!”

He added, a child-like smile of excitement on his face. At the same time, he turned to look at Engineer Li.

Engineer Li understood and smiled, pointing to the river surface and saying:

“Look, the Jinsha River is capturing the Min River.”

Indeed, the molten gold-like waters of the Jinsha River, with a passionate force, rushed into the jade-green waters of the Min River. Thus, the red, molten gold-like Jinsha River water, and the green, jade-like Min River water, clashed, intertwined, and embraced in the heart of the river, condensing into a string of red and green circular patterns, rolling and flowing downstream.

The boat chased after these beautiful patterns, sailing rapidly. The Soviet expert and Chinese engineers on the bow of the ship all stared intently at the wondrous sight of the confluence of the two rivers… This was the Yangtze River. These rolling, flowing red and green patterns gave the impression that the Yangtze River was cast from gold and jade.

Following the Yangtze River, the boat made a turn, sailing into a canyon. The river water in the canyon rushed along, gasping for breath, and the high mountains on both sides obscured the sky, leaving only a line of light. As the boat emerged from the canyon, the sun came out, and the boat dropped anchor in front of a not-too-steep hillside on the left bank.

The survey team went ashore. The tall, elderly team leader (himself a surveying expert) was the first to run up the mountain. It turned out that a surveying team was working on the hilltop. He ran up and asked a few questions, then stood on the mountain, looking around with binoculars.

The hydraulic general expert, together with Engineer Li, walked upstream along a mountain path on the mountainside. The elderly, portly construction expert went with a Chinese engineer and a translator to inspect the construction site. The electrical expert, the lock expert, and the tunnel expert each went with their respective professional engineers to carry out activities. Only the tall expert in large-scale concrete high dams stood alone on the shore, looking at blueprints, drawing on them as he looked, as if the dam were about to appear there. The cost estimation expert—a humorous Ukrainian—and his female translator sat beneath a cool bamboo grove, looking at the terrain, looking at the blueprints, and writing something in their notebooks…

I followed Engineer Li and the hydraulic expert’s group. In front of a protruding cliff, Engineer Li stopped.

“From here to the highest peak on the opposite bank,” he pointed with the wooden handle of his geological hammer, “is the downstream dam axis of the No. 1 hub on the main stream.”

Following the geological hammer's handle, many eyes looked over. At the same time, the expert opened the blueprints.

“Here,” Engineer Li pointed on the blueprints, and at the same time the expert drew a red line across the Yangtze River, between the mountain peaks on the left and right banks.

“If its elevation is 330 meters,” Engineer Li continued, “it can connect to the No. 1 hub on the Min River tributary; if it is 370 meters, it can directly connect to the Dadu River hub.”

“What about below?” the expert asked, clearly thinking of another issue.

“Below,” Engineer Li replied, “it can connect to the No. 2 hub on the main stream, or it can connect to No. 3, depending on the elevation and how many levels of development there are.”

The expert flipped open another blueprint, contemplating the No. 3 dam site on the tributary that he had looked at yesterday.

After a moment, the expert laid the two blueprints side by side, pointing them out to everyone:

“Please see,” he said. “In terms of construction conditions, the tributary is better than the main stream; we just saw the Jinsha River, and the diversion project on the tributary is relatively easy; however, the Jinsha River is left out, so we have to consider how the cascade system on the main stream should be arranged, and the elevation of the Three Gorges hub.”

As he spoke, he opened the topographic map of the Three Gorges hub. The precipitous cliffs that looked like a “great axe-cut method” to painters, here became the granite gneiss of the “Huangling Anticline”; on the six cross-sections marked with different geological colors, there was a light blue dam axis on each, labeled South I, South III, US I, US III, US VI, US VIII. On each cross-section, there were various different hydraulic designs.

The blueprints shone with a faint blue light under the sun, like the sky this morning. People looked at them, silent, their thoughts drawn again to the great Three Gorges Project, and at the same time comparing and discussing it in their minds with the current project.

The expert glanced around at the contemplative faces of the Chinese engineers. He knew their interest, so he smiled, stood up, and said:

“Let’s save that for when we get to the Three Gorges! What deserves attention at the moment is the geological situation here.”

He walked towards a huge rock that had clearly collapsed from the top of the mountain, pointing to its surface and saying:

“There has been seismic activity here.”

Everyone gathered around. Sure enough, on the surface of the rock, there were broad, abrasive marks like those left by a farmer sharpening a sickle.

“This may be the result of rock strata twisting during the orogenic movement era,” Engineer Li judged. “Or it may be the marks of glacial abrasion during the Ice Age.”

“Yes,” the expert agreed. “But the geological situation here should be clarified first.”

He suddenly turned around, looking at a deep green drilling rig tent on a distant hilltop, “Can we go see the rock cores?”

Engineer Li nodded, and the team climbed up the steep, narrow mountain path.

At this moment, I stood on the high Guagong Mountain, facing the rolling, eastward-flowing river, looking at the experts and engineers running around under the scorching sun; as well as those surveyors standing on the high mountains, using an umbrella to shield the level while standing in the sun to take measurements; those drilling team members who were operating drilling rigs on the broken cliffs to extract rock cores; geologists running around the mountains with water bottles hanging from their waists and geological hammers in their hands… Suddenly, I felt that these people had all turned into dreamers like children!

Originally, I always thought that scientists were only concerned with seeking truth. Listening to them speak and watching them work, it seemed that there was only mutual verification of facts themselves, without any personal emotions or imagination. Now I realized, that wasn’t the case. What they were doing, and the reason they were doing it, was precisely because a great ideal, even a fantasy, was inspiring them!

Just imagine: when the Three Gorges Dam is completed, what will happen to our country! At this moment, anticipation took me to the Three Gorges… I seemed to see: the Three Gorges had become a vast, thousand-mile-long man-made sea; at the mouth of the Xiling Gorge, cutting across the Yangtze River, rose a 235-meter-high concrete dam, with the river water rolling over the dam, forming a hanging waterfall 200 meters high and 400 meters wide! On its right bank was an underground power plant two kilometers long, and on the shore was a forest of steel towers, from which 400,000-volt high-voltage power lines stretched out in all directions, sending electricity to Beijing, Shanghai, Lanzhou, and Kunming, illuminating half of China with the power it generated! On its left bank was a series of climbing ship locks three kilometers long, with ten-thousand-ton ships passing through, honking their horns in salute to each other, traveling between Shanghai and Chongqing. Upstream from the Three Gorges, the entire rich southwest region had developed countless underground treasures, and towering chimneys stood like a forest; downstream from the Three Gorges, along the banks of the 1,800-kilometer stretch to Wusong, water disasters had been eradicated, and schistosomiasis had been eliminated; electric tractors were working in the fields. And to the north, the Three Gorges water flowed through a 100-kilometer-long tunnel, from the Dan River into the Yellow River, and then through the Wei River into the Hai River, irrigating the vast plains of North China, turning this fertile but water-deficient land into paddy fields yielding two crops a year. To the south, the ancient Xiang-Gui Canal was restored, allowing passage from Hainan Island via the Yangtze River, across the Yellow River, and directly to Beijing! On our country's land, north and south, east and west, running through each other, forming a unified whole of transportation, irrigation, and power generation linked by a unified water system!

Is this a fantasy? Yes, but it is a scientific, well-founded fantasy. Let us fantasize! Only by daring to fantasize can mankind constantly conquer nature in practice and become its master!

However, this is not just a fantasy! This is already a plan in progress. Thousands of scientists, engineers, and workers are working day and night to turn fantasy into a plan, and the plan into reality.

    在金沙江上游
    长江行之三
    本报特约记者  方纪
    我随同一个由中国水利工程师和苏联水工专家组成的查勘队，在长江上行进。
    早晨，船从上游一个城市的码头上开出，向下游行驶。天刚刚亮，江面上淡淡的薄雾正在升起；岷江的清清的江水，浮着这只不大的、干净的客轮，无声地顺水滑行。
    “昨天以前，看的还都是支流枢纽；从今天起，我们是在干流上了。”
    船头上站的李工程师，对一位和他并肩站在一起的苏联水工总体专家说。专家只点了点头，没有说话。看起来，他正聚精会神地注视着江面上的什么东西。
    这个查勘队已经走了许多路。他们从成都出发，先到灌县，参观了我国古代最伟大的水利工程都江堰——这给人一种印象：仿佛是说，既然我们的祖先，在那样的条件下，还能够凿“离堆”而导岷江，治伏了沫水，灌溉了川西平原的千里沃野，使之成为“天府之国”，那么，在我们的时代，还有什么事情做不来呢？
    然后，查勘队又经新津，过彭山、眉山、夹江，到乐山，观看了大渡河与岷江会流的情形；再到五通、犍为，察看了支流枢纽上的两个坝址，才到了这个岷江与金沙江汇流的地方。
    这时，右岸忽然开朗，透出一片像彩缎一般的明亮的天空。同时，水声大作，船迎着水声驶去。
    可以看到，在那彩缎一般的明亮的天空下，从一条峡谷里涌出一团像朝霞一般的橙红色的云雾，笼罩着滚滚流动的赤金般的金沙江水，势如万马奔腾，冲入岷江中来。
    “金沙江！”
    专家忽然兴奋地用不完全准确的发音读出这个字来。显然，他老早等待的，就是这个了。
    “这才看到了长江！”
    他接着说，脸上带着孩子般的兴奋的笑容。同时转过头来，看看李工程师。
    李工程师会意地笑了，点点头，用手指向江面说：
    “看，金沙江在切夺岷江了。”
    果然，金沙江的赤金般的江水，以一种激情的力量，冲入那绿得像碧玉一般的岷江中来。于是红得像赤金的金沙江水，和绿得像碧玉般的岷江江水，在江心中互相冲击，互相夹缠，互相拥抱，凝成一串红绿相间的圆形的图案，滚动着，向下游流去。
    船追逐着这些美丽的图案，急速地行驶。船头上的苏联专家和中国工程师们，都目不转睛地凝望着这两江汇流的奇景……这就是长江，这红绿相间的滚滚流动的图案，使人觉得长江就像是金玉铸成的。
    顺着长江，船转了一个弯，驶进一条峡谷中，峡谷中的江水带着喘息奔流着，两岸的高山把天空遮得像一条线；当船驶出峡谷时，太阳出来了，船在靠左岸的一个不太陡峭的山坡前抛了锚。
    查勘队上岸了。高个子、上了年纪的专家组长（他本身是测量专家），首先跑上山去，原来山头上正有一个测量队在工作，他跑上去问了几句什么，便也站在山上用望远镜了望起来。
    和李工程师一起的水工总体专家，却沿半山上的一条山路向上游走去。年老的、胖胖的施工专家，同了一个中国工程师和一个翻译去看施工场地；电气专家、船闸专家，和隧洞专家，各同自己的专业工程师分别去进行活动；只有高个子的大型混凝土高坝专家，一个人站在岸边看图纸，边看边在图纸上画，好像坝就要在那里出现似的。造价专家——幽默的乌克兰人，同他的女翻译，坐在一片幽凉的竹丛下面，望望地形，望望图纸，又在本子上写些什么。……
    我跟着李工程师和水工专家那一组人走去，在一块突出的悬崖前面，李工程师站住了。
    “从这里到对岸那个最高的山峰，”他用地质锤的木柄指了过去，“是干流第一号枢纽的下口坝轴线。”
    顺着地质锤的木柄，许多人的眼睛望过去。同时，专家打开了图纸。
    “在这里，”李工程师在图纸上指了一下，同时专家在左右两岸的山峰间，横过长江，画了一条红线。
    “如果它的高程是三三○，”李工程师接着说下去。“可以接岷江支流的一号枢纽；如果是三七○，可以直接大渡河的枢纽了。”
    “下面呢？”专家问，显然是想到了别的问题。
    “下面，”李工程师回答，“可以接干流二号枢纽，也可接三号，那要看高程多少，分几级开发。”
    专家翻开另一张图纸，望着昨天看过的支流三号坝址沉思起来。
    停了一会儿，专家把两张图纸摆在一起，指给大家看：
    “请看，”他说。“在施工条件方面，支流比干流好；我们刚才都看到金沙江了，支流的导流工程就比较容易；但是，金沙江却被撇在外面，就要考虑干流梯级的摆法，和三峡枢纽的高程了。”
    说着，他打开了三峡枢纽的地形图。原来那些在画家看来如“大斧劈法”的断崖峭壁，在这里却成了“黄陵大背斜”的花岗片麻岩；在标有不同地质颜色的六个断面上，各有一条淡蓝色的坝轴线，它们的标号是南Ⅰ、南Ⅲ、美Ⅰ、美Ⅲ、美Ⅵ、美Ⅷ。在每一个断面上，都有各种不同的水工设计。
    图纸在太阳下闪着淡蓝色的光辉，像这早晨的天空一样。人们望着它，沉默着，思路又被那伟大的三峡工程所吸引，同时在脑子里和眼前的工程比较，论证。
    专家环顾了一下中国工程师们的沉思的面孔，他知道这些人们的兴趣，于是笑了笑，站起来说：
    “这还是等到三峡再看吧！目前值得注意的，是这里的地质情况。”
    他走向一块显然是由山顶上崩塌下来的巨大的岩石，指着它的表层说：
    “这里曾经震动过。”
    大家凑过去，果然，在岩石的表面上，有宽阔的、像农民磨过镰刀似的磨擦的痕迹。
    “这可能是造山运动时代，岩层扭动的结果。”李工程师判断说。“也可能是冰河时期，冰川磨擦的痕迹。”
    “是的，”专家同意说。“但这里的地质情况，应该首先弄清楚。”
    他忽然转过身去，望着远处山头上的一个深绿色的钻机帐篷，“我们可以去看看岩芯吗？”
    李工程师点点头，队伍沿着陡峭的羊肠小道，向山上爬去。……
    这时，我站在高高的挂弓山上，面对着滚滚东流的江水，望着那些在烈日下奔跑的专家们、工程师们；以及那站在高山上，正用一把伞，遮住水平仪，而自己站在太阳下进行测量的测量队员们；那些在断壁悬崖上，开动钻机，钻取岩芯的钻探队员们；腰间挂着水壶，手里提着地质锤满山奔跑的地质师们……忽然觉得，这些人都变成了像孩子一样的幻想家！
    原先，我总以为科学家们是只有求实精神的。听着他们说话，看着他们做事，好像是只有事实本身的相互论证，不带任何个人的情感和想像。现在才知道，并不。他们所做的，以及他们之所以这样做，正是因为一种伟大的理想，以至幻想，在鼓舞着他们！
    试想一下吧：当三峡大坝建成的时候，我们的国家将发生什么事情！这时，憧憬把我带到了三峡，……我仿佛看到：三峡已经变成了一个浩瀚千里的人造海洋；在西陵峡口，横断长江，升起了一座235公尺的混凝土大坝，江水滚坝而过，构成了一个高二百公尺、宽四百公尺的悬天瀑布！在它右岸，是长达两公里的地下电厂，岸上是森林一般的钢塔，从那里向四面八方伸出四十万伏特的高压电线，把电送到北京、上海、兰州、昆明，半个中国为它所发出的电力照耀得一片通明！在它左岸，是连续三公里长的爬山船闸，万吨级的轮船互相鸣笛致敬而过，来往于上海重庆之间。从三峡往上，整个富饶的西南地区，开发了无限的地下宝藏，立起了如林的烟囱；三峡以下，直到吴淞一千八百公里的沿江两岸，根绝了水患，消灭了血吸虫病；电动拖拉机在田野里工作。而向北，三峡江水经过一条长达一百公里的隧洞，由丹江流入黄河、再经卫河入海河，灌溉了华北广大平原。使这一片肥美而雨量不足的土地，变成了一年两收的水田。向南，恢复了古代的湘桂运河，由海南岛经长江、过黄河，而直达北京！在我们祖国的土地上，南北东西，纵横贯通，成了一个由统一的水系所联结的航运、灌溉和发电的整体！
    这是幻想吗？是的，但是科学的、有根据的幻想。让我们幻想吧！只因为敢于幻想，人类才在不断的实践中，战胜了自然，而成为它的主人！
    然而，这不只是幻想而已！这已经是一个正在进行的计划。成千的科学家、工程师和工人们，正在为把幻想变成计划，把计划变成现实，而昼夜不停地工作着。……
