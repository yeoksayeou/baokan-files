    The Growth of Minority Workers in Xinjiang
    Ye Qianmu
    When you step into the factories and mines scattered across the north and south of the Tianshan Mountains, or visit the petroleum and railway survey teams, you can see workers from various ethnic groups. They wear different clothes, speak different languages, and work, study, and live together. At that moment, you will surely feel proud that Xinjiang has begun to have modern industry and a contingent of ethnic minority workers.
    At present, according to incomplete statistics, there are more than 12,000 minority workers in Xinjiang's state-owned and locally state-owned factories and mines. They include thirteen ethnic groups such as Uyghur, Kazakh, Kyrgyz, Uzbek, Tatar, Tajik, Russian, Xibe, Mongolian, Hui, Han, and Manchu. In the Xinjiang Nonferrous Metals Company, minority workers account for more than 80% of the total number of employees.
    It is not difficult for people to recall the situation before liberation. At that time, Xinjiang had only four or five dilapidated factories, and the workers lived a life of not having enough to eat or wear. In the early days after liberation, the Party and the People's Government attached importance to the development of Xinjiang's industry. In order to quickly train a group of workers who could master advanced production technology, the Party promptly selected a group of ethnic minority workers to study in the interior. Since 1952, many workers have been sent to Suzhou to learn silk reeling techniques, to Huainan Coal Mine to learn coal mining techniques, and to Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant to learn iron and steel smelting techniques, and so on. In addition, professional training classes and short-term spare-time training classes were also held, and masters were organized to train apprentices, cultivating a large number of ethnic minority workers.
    Some of the ethnic minority workers came from rural areas, and some came from pastoral areas, inevitably bringing with them quite strong petty-bourgeois living habits. Initially, they were not accustomed to collective life. Some missed their families, and some lacked confidence in learning technology because they did not understand the Han language. A small number of ethnic minority workers, influenced by the ethnic estrangement created by the feudal dynasties and the Kuomintang reactionaries in the past, were still not very willing to approach Han comrades. Based on this situation, the Party organizations of various enterprises constantly educated Party members to patiently and conscientiously help them improve their ideological understanding and technical level.
    In the Xinjiang July 1st Cotton Textile Factory, some workshops, under the leadership of the Party branch, adopted a method of one Party member helping one ethnic minority worker, requiring Party members not only to be responsible for teaching technology well, but also to help minority comrades ideologically. When Haikas, a Uyghur female worker in the sliver and roving workshop, first entered the factory, she was not accustomed to collective life. Huang Yinduan, a Communist Party member in the same workshop, patiently helped her and took care of her in life, often fetching water for her, taking her to see a doctor, and taking care of her meticulously. Haikas was greatly moved and actively learned technology. In just a few months, she became a skilled technical worker.
    In the parts repair workshop of the October Automobile Repair Factory, a production team led by Communist Party member Zhuo Daosheng had three Uyghur workers. Tuohuniya Zi often had to rework because he was not skilled in his work, and Maimaiti also affected the quality of the products because he only cared about overfulfilling the production tasks. Zhuo Daosheng considered that if he wanted to help them, he had to integrate with them in life first. Therefore, he used his spare time every day to learn Uyghur, and often went out to play and eat with them on Sundays. Seeing that the Uyghur workers loved singing and dancing, he signed a contract with them to learn from each other. He also tried to help Maimaiti solve his family life difficulties. In this way, Zhuo Daosheng gradually established a brotherly friendship with the Uyghur workers. This team overfulfilled its plan every month, and in 1955 it was named the factory's youth advanced team.
    Now, the employees of all ethnic groups have not only become skilled in technology, but also are becoming more and more mature politically. Many people have joined the Communist Party and the Communist Youth League, many have been named model workers and advanced producers, and some have been promoted to leading cadres and engineering technicians. In the Dushanzi Mining Area of Xinjiang Petroleum Company alone, six people have been promoted to important positions such as deputy manager or deputy director; the drilling division of the mining area alone has trained more than 300 minority engineering technicians. Habakrov Suoertang, a Kazakh worker from Xinjiang Nonferrous Metals Company, used to be a herdsman, but now he has learned from Soviet experts the production techniques of mineral processing, sampling, and identifying dozens of mineral samples.
    As the Lanxin Railway is being built westward, Xinjiang's industrial construction will be carried out on a larger scale. The contingent of ethnic minority workers in the entire Xinjiang will also continue to grow and develop.

    新疆少数民族工人的成长 
    叶茜牧
    当你走进分布在天山南北的工厂和矿场，或者访问那些石油、铁路勘测队的时候，你可以见到几种民族的工人，他们穿着不同的服装，说着不同的语言，在共同劳动，共同学习，共同生活。那时候，你一定会为新疆开始有了近代工业，有了一支民族工人的队伍而感到骄傲。
    目前，据不完全统计，新疆的国营和地方国营厂矿中，共有少数民族工人一万二千多人。他们包括维吾尔、哈萨克、柯尔克孜、乌孜别克、塔塔尔、塔吉克、俄罗斯、锡伯、蒙古、回、汉、满等十三个民族。新疆有色金属公司少数民族工人占职工总人数的80％以上。
    人们不难回忆解放前的情景。那时候，新疆只有四、五座破烂的工厂，工人过着吃不饱、穿不暖的生活。解放初期，党和人民政府就重视发展新疆的工业。为了迅速培养一批能够掌握先进生产技术的工人，党及时地选送了一批民族工人到内地学习。从一九五二年起，许多工人先后被派到苏州去学习缫丝技术，到淮南煤矿学习采煤技术，到石景山钢铁厂学习冶炼钢铁技术，……。此外，还举办专业训练班、短期业余训练班，组织师傅带徒弟，培养了大批民族工人。
    少数民族工人中，有的来自农村，有的来自牧区，不免带有相当浓厚的小生产者的生活习气。最初，他们不习惯集体生活，有的想家，有的因为不懂汉族语言，对学习技术缺乏信心。小部分少数民族工人，由于受过去封建皇朝和国民党反动派所制造的民族隔阂的影响，还不大愿意接近汉族同志。各企业的党组织根据这种情况，不断地教育党员要耐心地认真地帮助他们提高思想认识，提高技术水平。
    新疆七一棉纺织厂有的车间在党支部的领导下，采取了一个党员帮助一个少数民族工人的办法，要求党员不仅要负责教好技术，还要从思想上帮助少数民族的同志。梳条粗纱车间的维族女工哈衣卡司刚进厂的时候，不习惯过集体生活。同车间的共产党员黄印端就耐心帮助她，并且从生活上关心她，经常给她打水啦，带她去看病啦，照顾得无微不至。哈衣卡司大受感动，积极学习技术，短短几个月她就成了一个熟练的技术工人。
    十月汽车修配厂零件修制车间，共产党员卓道生领导的一个生产小组，有三个维族工人。托乎尼亚孜因为工作不熟练常常要做返工活，买买提也因为只顾超额完成生产任务，影响了产品质量。卓道生考虑到如果要帮助他们，先得同他们在生活上打成一片。因此，他每天利用业余时间学习维吾尔语，星期日常和他们一道出去玩，一块吃饭。他看到维族工人喜爱唱歌和跳舞，就同他们订立合同，互相学习。他还设法帮助买买提解决了家庭生活困难。这样，卓道生逐步和维族工人建立了兄弟般的友谊。这个小组作到月月超额完成计划，一九五五年被命名为全厂的青年先进小组。
    现在，各族职工不仅在技术上熟练起来，政治上也一天天成熟起来了。许多人加入了共产党和青年团，许多人被评为劳动模范和先进生产者，有的被提拔为领导干部、工程技术人员。仅新疆石油公司独山子矿区就有六个人被提拔担任副经理或副处长等重要职务；矿区钻井处一个单位就培养了三百多名少数民族的工程技术人员。新疆有色金属公司哈萨克族工人哈巴克若夫·锁尔堂，从前是一个牧民，现在已经向苏联专家学会了选矿、取样和鉴别几十种矿样的生产技术。
    随着兰新铁路加紧向西修筑，新疆工业建设将以更大的规模开展起来。全新疆少数民族工人的队伍也将不断地壮大、发展。
