    National Conference of Advanced Workers in Rural Finance Opens
    (Our Newspaper) Beijing, July 12th - The National Conference of Advanced Workers in Rural Finance opened in Beijing on the 12th.

    The more than 500 delegates attending the conference are advanced individuals engaged in rural banking and credit cooperative work, such as rural bank branch directors, agricultural loan officers, accountants, cashiers, and communication officers; and credit cooperative directors, council members, accountants, and member representatives.

    Huang Yaguang, Vice President of the People's Bank of China, delivered the opening address at the conference.

    Li Shaoyu, Director of the Head Office of the Agricultural Bank of China, gave a report on rural financial business. In his report, he focused on the tasks of rural financial work in the second half of the year. He said that the total agricultural loan funds for this year are 2.2 billion yuan, and more than 1.7 billion yuan has been issued so far, with more than 400 million yuan available for continued issuance in the second half of the year. In order to ensure that agricultural loan funds can truly play a role, in future lending, we should help agricultural producers' cooperatives to carefully analyze their financial plans and implement the policy of diligence and thrift in running the cooperatives. Regarding the peak season loan recovery work, the general spirit should still be to implement the principle of "borrowing and repaying," and efforts should be made to recover loans that are due. However, we should adopt patient persuasion methods, reason with farmers, and persuade farmers who are indeed capable of repaying their loans to do so. For the few farmers who are truly unable to repay their loans, we can postpone or recover the loans in installments depending on the circumstances.

    Regarding the work of credit cooperatives, he said that the work of consolidating and merging cooperatives will continue in the second half of the year. After the expansion of the community scope, attention should be paid to solving the convenience problems of members' deposit, withdrawal, lending, and repayment, so that the business of credit cooperatives can be developed more widely and deeply on the existing foundation. Regarding the accounting guidance work of agricultural producers' cooperatives, he emphasized the need to strengthen organizational leadership, and all rural financial workers must earnestly study the financial and accounting work of agricultural producers' cooperatives, help agricultural producers' cooperatives to achieve the policy of diligence and thrift, and at the same time do a good job in agricultural loan work.

    在信用合作社的工作方面，他说，下半年内整社、并社工作还要继续进行，社区范围扩大后，应注意解决社员存、取，贷、还的方便问题，以便使信用社的业务在现有基础上能够更加广泛深入地发展。关于农业生产合作社会计辅导工作，他强调要加强组织领导，所有的农村金融工作人员必须认真地学习农业生产合作社的财务、会计工作，帮助农业生产合作社实现勤俭办社的方针，同时做好农贷工作。
