Xinhua News Agency report: The Chinese Lüda Song and Dance Troupe, which will go to Ulaanbaatar at the beginning of this month to celebrate the 35th anniversary of the Mongolian People's Revolution, gave five public performances in Beijing in mid-June.

The audience especially praised the dance "Flower Drum" created by Zhang Yi, a young actor of the Song and Dance Troupe. Ten young men and women, carrying waist drums, used two three-foot-long tassels in their hands to beat out various drum beats. The dance is extremely beautiful and healthy. "Flower Drum" was created in 1954 and has been performed more than one hundred times.

The folk songs sung by the chorus actors were requested by the audience to be repeated every time. Bao Yanyi, the leading singer of the Shaanxi folk song "Little Peddler," was a fitter two years ago, and Xia Xinjun, the leading singer of the Northeast folk song "Looking at the Lover," was a draftsman in a factory three years ago. Because of their singing talents, they have successively become professional singers. The chorus actors also sang "Horse Separated from the Herd" and "My Fast Horse" in Mongolian.

    旅大歌舞团的精彩节目
    据新华社讯　将在本月初赴乌兰巴托庆祝蒙古人民革命胜利三十五周年的中国旅大歌舞团，六月中旬在北京作了五次公演。
    观众特别赞扬歌舞团青年演员张毅创作的舞蹈“花鼓”。十个青年男女背着腰鼓，双手用两根三尺来长的穗子打出各种鼓点。舞蹈极其优美、健康。“花鼓”是在1954年创作的，已经演出一百多次。
    合唱演员演唱的民歌，每次都被观众们要求重复表演。陕北民歌“小货郎”领唱者鲍延义两年前还是一个钳工，东北民歌“瞧情郎”领唱者夏馨君三年前是一个工厂的绘图员，由于他们的演唱才能，先后成为专业歌唱演员。合唱演员还用蒙古族语言演唱了“脱群之马”和“我的快骏马”。
