    The pale purple twilight, carrying the sultry heat of July, slowly recedes into the dark gray night. Beihai, in the flickering lights, begins its most beautiful moment.

    A red wall separates the prosperity of the city, and the seawater emits a fresh and moist breath. Stone bridges, green waves, weeping willows, and flying eaves harmoniously constitute an elegant literary realm and poetic charm. The night of Beihai welcomes every visitor with all it possesses.

    Visitors arrive, mostly at dusk. Buses and trams, fully loaded with guests, come here from all directions. Mothers with their children, girls leaning on their lovers, convalescing patients, white-bearded old men, workers just leaving the factory, office workers finishing work, and students, male and female students, they all come here to enjoy the generous gifts of Beihai.

    Lights reveal bright spots among the green trees, and on the sea, yachts drift to and fro at will. Oars beat the seawater, and ripples spread out in layers. In the distance, from some direction, clear singing floats over again. On the neat sidewalks, people stroll leisurely. A few bats chasing night insects sometimes suddenly dart past visitors, bringing the slightest sound of wind. Along the coast, there are weeping willows everywhere. The weeping willows use their soft branches to caress the green-painted chairs by the roadside. People who like quiet come here to sit quietly, stretch out their bodies comfortably, rest, admire, and talk softly with their companions.

    What is that brightly lit place? It is an elegant teahouse. Visitors feel like they are back in their own homes, order a pot of tea, sit down, and slowly sip it, and the heat of the day disappears in an instant. Listen, who is talking about the films and plays being staged, talking about their ideals and hopes, and telling the poem they recently read...?

    The White Pagoda resists the invasion of the night with its milky white body. Several winding paths wind from the foot of the mountain to the halfway point of the White Pagoda. Standing by the railing next to the White Pagoda, overlooking Beijing in the vast night, thousands of lights, the whole city is brightly lit. In the scattered lights, seeing all kinds of scenery, you can only see the outlines, as if they are forever elusive. But it is precisely this hazy feeling that makes people put aside all distracting thoughts and appreciate and ponder with a leisurely mind. The scenery seems particularly intimate.

    Here, everything is quiet, gentle, and peaceful....

    I love the tranquility of Beihai at night, not because of its loneliness. No, it is not lonely. It is changing, developing, living in people's lives, and breathing with the construction of the entire capital.

    I love the full peace mood of Beihai, not because of the gentleness of the sea. The sea is not always gentle and looks so timid. When a storm invades it, it will stir up waves, and the waves angrily hit the cliffs, demonstrating against the invaders.

    Life smiles at people; in the night, in the night after labor, on the July night in Beihai, life smiles even more movingly and sweetly....

    北海的七月之夜
    王青
    淡紫色的暮霭，携带着七月的闷人的暑气，缓缓地隐退到暗灰的夜色里去了。北海，在灯光的闪烁里，开始了它的最美好的时刻。
    一道红墙隔开了城市的繁荣，海水散发出清新湿润的气息，石桥、碧波、垂柳和飞檐，和谐地构成了典雅的词境和诗意；北海之夜，就这样用它所拥有的一切，迎接着每一个到来的游人。
    游人来了，多半是在黄昏时分。公共汽车和电车，满载着客人从四面八方来到这里。母亲们带着孩子，姑娘们偎倚着恋人，初愈的病患者，白须的老翁，刚刚离开厂房的工人，工作完毕的机关工作人员，还有学生们，男学生和女学生们，他们都来到这里，享受北海的慷慨的赐予。
    灯火在绿树丛中透露出点点亮光，海面上，一支支游艇任意荡去荡来。双桨拍打着海水，涟漪一层层散了开去，远处，不知从那个方向，又飘来了清亮的歌声。整洁的人行道上，有人在悠闲地漫步，几支追捕夜昆虫的蝙蝠，有时突然从游人面前掠过，带着最轻微的风声。沿海岸，到处都是垂柳。垂柳用它的柔枝拂拭着路旁漆成绿色的坐椅，喜好安静的人们，来这里悄悄坐下，舒展地伸开体躯，休息，观赏，轻声地同他的伙伴交谈。
    那灯火辉煌的去处是甚么地方？那是幽雅的茶座。游人像是回到了自己的家，要上一壶清茶，坐下来，慢慢地啜饮，白昼的暑气一时都消尽了。你听，这是谁在谈论着上演的影剧，在讲述着自己的理想和希望，在述说他最近读到的一首诗……？
    白塔，以它通体的乳白色抗拒着黑夜的侵袭。几条曲折的小径，从山下直盘到白塔的半腰。站在白塔身旁的栏杆里，在夜色苍茫中鸟瞰北京，万家灯火，满城一片通明。在星散的灯光里，看各种的景物，只能见到轮廓，仿佛永远不可捉摸。却也正是这朦胧的感觉，使人推开一切繁想杂念，怀着闲暇的心意，欣赏，揣摩，景物反显得格外亲切。
    这里，一切都是静谧的，温和的，安详的……。
    我爱北海夜晚的宁静，却不是因为它的孤寂。不，它并不孤寂。它变化着，发展着，生活在人们的生活里，和整个京城的建设通着呼吸。
    我爱北海的饱满的和平情调，也不是因为海水的文静。海水并不永远文静，而显得那样的怯懦。当暴风侵犯它的时候，它会掀起波涛，浪花愤怒地冲击着崖石，向侵袭者示威。
    生活向人们发出微笑；在夜晚，在劳动之后的夜晚，在北海的七月之夜，生活却笑得更动人，更甜蜜……。
