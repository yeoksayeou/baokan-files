Readers' Letters
    Give movie theater staff time to rest!
    In Taiyuan City, movie theaters have a long-standing problem of unlimited overtime, causing excessive fatigue among staff. They not only miss out on legal holidays but also have little time for studying and managing household affairs, which often causes them distress. Some female comrades, lacking time to care for their children, consider giving them away. There are many examples of unlimited overtime. During new film exhibition weeks, some theaters show as many as nine or ten films a day, with staff working from five or six in the morning until eleven or twelve at night. Movie theater meetings are also frequent. For example, during the "Four Goods" campaign (good at screening, organizing audiences, promotion, and service attitude) launched in April this year, theaters were simply showing films and holding meetings, and holding meetings and showing films. The Dazhong Cinema once showed five films in a day and held three meetings before and after the screenings. One meeting went on until after midnight, and some mothers with many children didn't get to sleep until 2 a.m.
    Movie theater staff wages are also very low. The lowest-paid ticket sellers earn only a little over twenty yuan per month. Some female ticket sellers, due to long-term sleep deprivation, cannot breastfeed their babies and have to buy milk, plus candies, biscuits, and pay for a nanny, costing them more than thirty yuan a month. Their wages aren't even enough to raise a child, let alone themselves.
    Why is it that the government's prohibitions against frequent overtime and regulations regarding wages and benefits are never implemented in Taiyuan City movie theaters?

    Stereotypical Content Summaries
    Currently, literary works published by various publishing houses all have "content summaries" or "content introductions." These are necessary for readers. However, the writing style is almost uniformly stereotypical, always stating something like "concise and easy-to-understand language," "possessing a certain artistic level and educational effect," and "offering some help to young people." If it is about the countryside, it always says: reflects the struggle between the old and new ideas of the peasants. If it is about factories, it praises the new people and new things on the industrial front, reflecting the working class's selfless labor, and so on. We hope that publishing houses will pay attention to the writing style of content summaries, making them concise, lively, and energetic.　Zhang Guohua

    Indicates Absence
    In the newspaper and magazine reading room of the Nanjing Library's Yihe Road branch, there is a row of black wooden shelves for magazines, with magazine nameplates in black characters on white paper attached to each compartment. One nameplate clearly reads "Archaeological Journal," with a small card pinned underneath saying: "To read this magazine, please borrow it from the lending desk." I wanted to read this magazine, so I filled out a borrowing slip and gave it to the person in charge of lending. The staff member looked at the borrowing slip and said, "Let me check." After checking at his desk, he told me, "This magazine has never arrived."
    "The magazine shelf in the reading room clearly says that it can be borrowed from the lending desk, so why isn't it here?" I asked.
    "That's how we indicate that we don't have this magazine."　San Ming

    读者中来
    给电影院工作人员休息时间！
    太原市各电影院，长期存在着无限制的加班加点的现象，使得工作人员过度疲劳，不但没有法定假日的休息，也很少有时间来从事学习和料理家务，因此同志们经常苦恼。有的女同志因为没有时间照顾孩子，想把孩子送给别人。无限制的加班加点的实例是很多的。新片展览周期间，有的影院多到每天放九场或十场电影，工作人员从早上五、六点钟起一直工作到深夜十一、二点才能休息，电影院的会也很多。如今年四月开展放映、组织观众、宣传、服务态度的“四好”运动的时候，影院每天就是放映、开会，开会、放映。大众电影院有一天放了五场电影，映前映后就开了三次会。有一次直开到半夜十二点多，有些孩子多的母亲睡觉时已经两点钟了。
    电影院工作人员的工资也很低，工资最低的售票员，每月只拿二十多元。有的女售票员，因为长期睡眠不足，生下孩子来没有奶吃，只得订牛奶，加上糖果，饼干和雇保姆的费用，一个月就得花去三十几元，拿的工资，连一个孩子都养不起，更别说自己了。
    为什么政府禁止经常加班加点和关于工资福利的规定或法令，总是贯彻不到太原市电影院来的？

    千篇一律的内容提要
    现在各个出版社出版的文学作品都有“内容提要”或“内容介绍”。这对于读者来说是很需要的。但是，写法上却近于千篇一律，总是什么“语言精炼、通俗易懂”，“具有一定的艺术水平和教育作用”，“对青年有一定的帮助”。如果是写农村的，总是说：反映了农民新旧思想的斗争。如果是工厂的，就是歌颂了工业战线上的新人新事，反映了工人阶级的忘我的劳动，等等。我们希望出版社注意一下内容提要的写法，使它短小精干、文字有生气。　张国华
    表示没有
    南京图书馆颐和路分馆的报纸杂志阅览室里有一排黑色的放杂志的木架子，上面一格一格的贴着白纸黑字的杂志名签。有一张名签分明写着“考古学报”四个字，其下又用图钉钉着一张小卡片，卡片上有话写道：“要看此杂志请向借阅处借阅”。我是要看这份杂志的，于是填好借书条交给管理借阅的人。那位工作人员一看借书条就说“待我查一查。”他到办公桌上一查之后告诉我：“这份杂志一直就没有来过。”
    “阅览室的杂志架上明明写着可到借阅处借阅的怎么没有呢？”我说。
    “我们这样就是表示没有这份杂志。”　三　明
