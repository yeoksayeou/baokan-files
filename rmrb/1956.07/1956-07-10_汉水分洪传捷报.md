    The Han River Diversion Reports Success
    By Xinhua News Agency Reporter Qu Yifan

    In late June, dense rain clouds blanketed the upper reaches of the Han River. Continuous rainfall occurred in southern Shaanxi, northwestern Hubei, and southern Henan. All major rivers in the Han River system experienced rising water levels, converging into a high flood peak – the third flood peak of the year – in the Han River's main stream, following closely on the heels of the recent second flood peak.

    Inside the Flood and Drought Prevention Headquarters of Hubei Province, people were closely monitoring the development of the Han River's water situation. On July 1st, the Dujiatai Flood Diversion Headquarters in the lower reaches of the Han River was established and subsequently received the order to execute the flood diversion task. This was a powerful support and encouragement to the people on both sides of the Han River who were engaged in flood prevention and production.

    At 2:10 PM on the 2nd, the Dujiatai Flood Diversion Gate, completed just over two months prior, opened its gates for the first time. The torrent of floodwater rushing into the gate surged, roared, and churned up waves ten feet high in the three-tiered energy dissipation pool of reinforced concrete at the bottom of the gate. After the fierce force gradually subsided, it flowed calmly along the broad diversion channel, passing through the old flood area of ​​about 660 square kilometers at the tail of the Dongjing River, and then slowly discharging into the Yangtze River from there.

    The Flood Diversion Headquarters office was equipped with two telephones, which rang incessantly day and night. One moment, the phone would ring, bringing intelligence from a certain location upstream reporting changes in the water situation, tracking the course of the third flood peak. The next moment, the microphone would be picked up, with inquiries from a certain location downstream about the news of the gate opening for flood diversion, or reports on the flood prevention situation downstream. The Flood Diversion Headquarters promptly reported the flood diversion situation to the province for instructions, and the province also constantly conveyed new instructions and orders. Everyone shared a common belief: to overcome the flood, ensure the safety of the lives and property of millions of people on both banks, and guarantee the bumper harvest of over ten million mu of farmland.

    Based on the changes in the Han River's water situation, the flood diversion gate was opened four times successively: On the afternoon of the 2nd, the first batch of fifteen gate openings were initially opened by only six centimeters; that evening, the water inlet height was further raised to nine centimeters. At noon on the 3rd, the tenacious flood continued to show an upward trend in the lower reaches, and the Provincial Flood and Drought Prevention Headquarters again issued an order - to fully open all thirty gate openings by six centimeters; by the afternoon of the 4th, they were universally raised by another three centimeters. After the fourth gate opening, the inflow of the flood diversion gate reached more than 2,500 cubic meters per second, diverting approximately 30% of the water volume from the upper reaches of the Han River. The rapidly rising flood was brought under control, and the downstream water level gradually stabilized. On the 5th and 6th, the downstream water level began to recede across the board.

    The good news of the flood diversion spread everywhere along the banks of the Han River, further encouraging the enthusiasm of the broad masses of people to overcome the flood and increase production for a bumper harvest. Before the flood diversion, the riverbed in the lower reaches of the Han River was already "full to the brim". The water level along the line of Hanchuan County exceeded the guaranteed water level, and the flood was only about one and a half meters from the top of the embankment. However, on the vast Jianghan Plain below the dike, despite the flood being six or seven meters higher than the ground inside the dike, the fields were still a verdant green. Cotton fields were covered with green leaves, mid-season rice was budding and heading, and early rice was already promising a good harvest. In the boundless farmland, farmers were peacefully engaged in production. The Dujiatai "Flood Diversion" Agricultural Cooperative, located close to the large gate, had more than two hundred mu of cotton growing particularly well this year, with cotton plants already over a foot tall. Hundreds of male and female members of the cooperative were tilling and weeding in the cotton fields; behind them stood the high dike and flood diversion gate. A photographer was taking pictures of a group of cooperative members in the fields. They excitedly said to the reporter: This cotton field was flooded in 1954, but this year, with the flood diversion project, a bumper harvest can be guaranteed.

    During the days of opening the gates for flood diversion, Dujiatai was filled with a boiling atmosphere. From early morning on the 2nd, nearby farmers successively rushed to Dujiatai. They had participated in the construction of this project, and now they wanted to personally see the situation of the gate opening for flood diversion, to see the victory of controlling the flood with their own hands. At the moment of the gate opening, the sides of the large gate, the highway bridge behind the gate, and the dikes on both sides of the diversion channel were crowded with people who came to visit. In the following days, the number of visitors continued to be endless. (Attached picture)

    汉水分洪传捷报
    新华社记者　曲一凡
    六月下旬，浓密的雨云笼罩着汉水上游地区，陕南、鄂西北和豫南一带连续降雨。汉水水系各大河流普遍涨水，到了汉水干流汇成一个高大的洪峰——今年的第三次洪峰，随着刚过去不久的第二次洪峰追踪而来。
    在湖北省防汛防旱总指挥部里，人们严密地注视着汉水水情的发展。七月一日，汉水下游杜家台分洪指挥部成立，接着就接受了执行分洪任务的命令。这对汉水两岸正在防汛和生产的人们，是一个有力的支援和鼓舞。
    二日下午二时十分，两个多月前才建成的杜家台分洪闸，第一次开启了闸门。涌进闸门的洪流，在闸底的钢筋混凝土铺设的三级消力池里奔腾着，咆哮着，翻起丈把高的浪花，待猛劲逐渐消失了，然后平静地沿着广阔的分洪道流去，通过东荆河尾闾约六百六十多平方公里的旧泛滥区，再从那里缓缓地泄入长江。
    分洪指挥部的办公室，安着两台电话机，日夜忙个不停。一会儿，这边的电话铃响了，传来上游某地报告水情变化的情报，追寻着第三次洪峰的行踪。一会儿，那边又拿起了传话筒，下游某地来探询启闸分洪的消息，或者报告下游防汛的情况。分洪指挥部随时把分洪情况向省里报告请示，省里也不时地传达新的指示和命令。大家有一个共同的信念：战胜洪水，确保两岸数百万人民生命财产的安全，保证两岸一千多万亩农田的丰收。
    根据汉水水情的变化，这座分洪闸先后启闸四次：二日下午第一批开启的十五孔闸门，先只开了六公寸；当天晚上，继续提升到九公寸的进水高度。三日中午，顽强的洪水在下游仍呈涨势，省防汛防旱总指挥部又传来命令——把全闸三十孔闸门全部开放六公寸；到四日下午又普遍提升了三公寸。第四次启闸以后，分洪闸每秒钟的进水量达到二千五百多公方，分出汉水上游水量的30％左右。急剧上涨的洪水被制住了，下游水势逐步平稳下来，五、六两日下游的水位开始全线退落。
    分洪的捷报，在汉水两岸到处传播着，更加鼓舞着广大人民战胜洪水、增产丰收的热情。分洪前，汉水下游的河槽已经“水涨槽满”了。汉川县沿线的水位都超过了保证水位，洪水距大堤顶只有一公尺半左右。但在堤下的广阔的江汉平原上，尽管洪水已经比堤内地面高出六、七公尺，田野里仍是一片青绿，棉花田里绿叶盖地，中稻正在打苞抽穗，早稻已经丰收在望。一望无际的农田里，农民们都在安心地生产。紧靠大闸的杜家台“分洪”农业社，今年有二百多亩棉花长得特别好，棉棵已经一尺多高。几百名男女社员，都在棉田里中耕除草；在他们的背后，矗立着高大的堤防和分洪闸。一位摄影记者在田间给一群社员拍照，他们兴奋地对这位记者说：1954年这块棉田被大水淹了，今年有了分洪工程，可以保证丰收。
    在启闸分洪的日子里，杜家台充满着一片沸腾的气氛。二日从清早起，附近的农民就陆续赶到杜家台来。他们曾参加过这个工程的建筑，现在他们要亲自看看启闸分洪的情况，看看用自己的双手制服洪水的胜利。到启闸的时刻，大闸的两旁，闸后的公路桥上，和分洪道两岸的大堤上，到处拥挤着前来参观的人群。以后的几天，参观的人仍是络绎不绝。（附图片）
