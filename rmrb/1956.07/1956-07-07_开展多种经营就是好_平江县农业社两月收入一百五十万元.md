Developing diversified operations is good
Pingjiang County agricultural cooperatives earn 1.5 million yuan in two months

    (Our report) The agricultural production cooperatives in Pingjiang County, Hunan Province, have achieved remarkable results in developing diversified operations. From the end of April to late June, the county's cooperatives have already earned 1.5 million yuan in cash from sideline production. If the various sideline production plans and economic crop production plans can be successfully completed, it is estimated that by the end of the year, the income from diversified operations will reach 11.6 million yuan, accounting for more than 40% of the county's total agricultural and sideline income.

    Since the beginning of spring this year, farmers in Pingjiang County have generally felt a "tightness of money." According to a survey by the County Party Committee Office in April, the county's 1,659 agricultural cooperatives needed a total of 1,800,163 yuan in production funds, and 36% of the funds could not be resolved. Many cooperative members faced great difficulties in production and life. The Sanbao Agricultural Cooperative in the former Jiashan Township, with 90 member households, had 42 households short of grain, farm tools, oil, salt, and clothing, requiring a total of 800 yuan to solve the problem. April was the peak season for spring plowing, and the countryside needed grain and fertilizer the most, but the 300,000 dan of oilseed cakes and more than 10,000 dan of sulfur soap purchased by the supply and marketing cooperatives from other places became "cold goods"; from January to April, only 600,000 jin of the county's 1 million jin of unified sale grain were sold. The Pingjiang County Committee of the Communist Party of China deeply analyzed the above situation and sent a group of investigation teams to conduct investigations in various economic type regions. The conclusion was that Pingjiang County has great potential for sideline production, and as long as it is fully exploited, it can greatly increase the income of farmers throughout the county. At the end of April, the County Party Committee called on cadres and agricultural cooperatives throughout the county to "take immediate action to ensure increased agricultural production, actively develop diversified operations, and increase the income of cooperative members." Diversified operations have been carried out in a guided manner throughout the county.

    At present, in addition to ensuring the normal growth of 650,000 mu of rice, the county has identified 72 types of production avenues, including processing, transportation, lime burning, planting economic crops such as jute, ramie, and peanuts, and raising sheep, pigs, fish, chickens, and ducks. In addition, more than 10,000 mu of wasteland have been reclaimed, 2,300 mu of oil-tea camellia mountains have been restored, and 7,000 mu of new-style tea gardens have been cultivated. These production activities can generate substantial income in three or four years. Now, the problem of cooperatives lacking funds has been largely resolved; through the advance payment of cooperative sideline income, the livelihood difficulties of 16,000 cooperative members have also been resolved.

    开展多种经营就是好
    平江县农业社两月收入一百五十万元
    本报讯　湖南省平江县农业生产合作社开展多种经营有了显著效果。从四月底到六月下旬，全县合作社经营副业生产已经收入现款一百五十万元。如果各项副业生产计划和各种经济作物生产计划能够顺利完成，到年底，预计多种经营的收入将达一千一百六十万元，占全县农副业总收入的40％以上。
    今年入春以来，平江县农民普遍感到“钱紧”。据县委办公室四月份的统计，全县1，659个农业社，共需生产资金一百八十万零一千一百六十三元，有36％的资金无法解决。许多社员，在生产、生活上有很大困难。原甲山小乡三宝农业社共有社员九十户，就有42户社员缺粮，缺农具、缺油盐和衣服，共需八百元才能解决问题。四月份正是春耕紧张时期，农村最需要粮食和肥料，可是供销合作社从外地购回的三十万石饼肥和一万多石硫?都变成了“冷货”；一月份到四月份全县应销的一百多万斤统销粮，只售出六十万斤。中共平江县委深入地分析了上述情况，并且派出一批调查组，先后到各种不同经济类型地区进行了调查，得出的结论是：平江县副业生产的潜力很大，只要充分发掘，就可以为全县农民增加大量收入。四月底，县委号召全县干部和农业社“立即行动起来，保证农业增产，积极开展多种经营，增加社员收入”。多种经营在全县范围内有领导地开展起来了。
    目前，全县除保证了六十五万亩稻子的正常成长以外，共找出加工、运输、烧石灰、种植黄麻、苎麻、花生等经济作物和养羊、养猪、养鱼、养鸡鸭等七十二种生产门路。此外，还开垦荒地一万多亩，垦复油茶山二千三百亩，培植新式茶园七千亩。这几项生产，三、四年后就可以增加大量收入。现在，农业社缺少资金的问题大部分已经解决；通过合作社副业收入的预支，一万六千户社员的生活困难问题也解决了。
