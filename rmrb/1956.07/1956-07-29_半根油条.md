    Half a Fried Dough Stick
    Shi Yin
    I arrived in Shanghai early in the morning, and the first thing I thought about was having breakfast. It's hard for people who haven't been to Shanghai to imagine how abundant Shanghai's breakfast is. Shanghai's breakfast can list at least thirty kinds. Taking soy milk as an example, it is divided into sweet and salty. The process of making salty soy milk is not complicated, but strangely, you can't find a single stall selling salty soy milk on the streets of Beijing. Therefore, Beijingers still can't eat it.
    Not far from the train station, there was a soy milk stall. A woman in her forties, wearing a snow-white apron, invited me to sit on a clean bench.
    A bowl of fragrant salty soy milk was placed in front of me. While drinking the soy milk, I ate the two fried dough sticks placed on a plate, specially prepared for diners. I drank two bowls of soy milk in one go, ate one and a half fried dough sticks, and put the remaining half back on the original plate.
    "Let's settle the bill!" I said to the stall owner.
      "What about this half a fried dough stick?" She looked at the half a fried dough stick and seemed a little embarrassed.
      "That's what I didn't finish, of course it's included in the bill." As I spoke, I took out two jiao from my pocket and handed it to her.
    "Two bowls of soy milk are one jiao, and each fried dough stick is three fen. You ate one and a half, which is really difficult... Let's do it this way! I'll count it as four fen, a total of one jiao and four fen, and I'll return six fen to you." As she spoke, she returned the money.
    "I couldn't finish it and couldn't take it with me, so how can I not pay for it? Besides, I don't care about two fen." I made some unnecessary explanations, thinking she was being too serious.
      "You can't say that, you pay for what you eat, and one fen must be counted clearly."
      "If you do this, you will lose money. Who wants the leftover fried dough sticks?"
      "No, you haven't eaten it, and it's not dirty, we can eat it ourselves."
      "This... count it as mine!"
    "Count it as ours!"
    The two fen coins were pushed back and forth, and both sides raised their voices a little. It seemed that an argument would occur. In the end, I threw the two fen on the table, picked up my luggage, and ran away.
      "Comrade! ...This..." The stall owner shouted after me.
    Ten years ago, living in Shanghai, if you didn't want others to take advantage of you, you always had to be prepared to argue with people when you went out. At that time, walking on the street, you could always see crowds of people gathered around. Looking inside, it was nothing more than two people arguing over some trivial matters. I have been away from Shanghai for ten years, and I thought I would never encounter an argument again. I didn't expect that as soon as I arrived in Shanghai, I almost had an argument over half a fried dough stick. What I didn't expect even more was that this argument was such an argument!

    半根油条
    石因
    到上海刚是清晨，首先想到的事是吃早点。没有到过上海的人是很难想像上海的早点有多么丰盛。上海的早点至少可以列出三十种。以豆浆说，就分甜、咸两种。咸豆浆操作的过程并不复杂，奇怪的是北京的街上找不出一家售咸豆浆的，因此北京人迄今还吃不上。
    离火车站不远就有豆浆摊，一个四十来岁围着雪白的围裙的妇人招呼我在一条干净的长凳上坐下。
    一碗香喷喷的咸豆浆放在我面前了。我一边喝浆，一边就吃放在碟子里专为食客准备的两根油条。我一口气喝了两碗浆，吃了一根半油条，把吃剩的半条放在原碟子里。
    “算账吧！”我对管摊子的主妇说。
      “这半根油条怎么办？”她看了看半根油条，有些为难起来。
      “那是我吃剩的，当然算在账里。”我一边说一边从口袋里掏出两角钱交给她。
    “两碗浆一角钱，油条每根三分，你吃了一根半，真难办……就这样吧！算你四分，一共一角四分，退你六分钱。”说着，她就退钱。
    “这是我吃不下，又带不走才剩下的，怎么能不算帐呢？何况我也不在乎两分钱。”我做了一些不必要的解说，我认为她过于认真了。
      “不能这么说，吃多少算多少，一分钱也要算清楚。”
      “这样干，你们要亏本的，吃剩的油条谁要呢？”
      “不会的，你没有吃过，也不脏，我们自己可以吃。”
      “这……算我的吧！”
    “算我们的吧！”
    两分钱的钞票推来推去，双方的声音都有些大了，看来，会发生争吵。最后，我把两分钱往桌上一掷，拿着行李一转身就跑掉了。
      “同志！……这……。”主妇在后面喊我。
    十年前，生活在上海，如果你不愿让别人占些便宜的话，出门总得准备和人发生争吵。那时在马路上走，总可以看到围着一团团人，挤进去一看，无非是两个人为了一些芝麻小事在争吵。离开上海十年了，本来以为不会再碰到争吵的事，想不到一到上海却为了半根油条几乎又发生争吵，更想不到的这争吵却是这样一种争吵！
