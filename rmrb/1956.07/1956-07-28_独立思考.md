    “Independent Thinking”
    Yu Yi
    After reading Comrade Xuan Zhu's "On Independent Thinking," I have some thoughts.

    Is it the case that we now don't know how to think independently? Have we now lost the ability to think independently?

    I think, absolutely not. We have not lost the ability to think independently.

    The problem lies in: some people are not accustomed to "independent thinking" themselves, nor are they accustomed to others "independent thinking." They put themselves in a box, and they also like to force others into a box. They pick up the dogmatic stick and patrol everywhere, and if they see someone crawling out of the box, they give them a blow with the stick. They are satisfied when they hear that monotonous tune, which they are accustomed to, being sung everywhere, and they fall asleep in the box.

    Their sticks have created a kind of public opinion, cultivating a group of echoing parrots, which seems to be a great momentum, and it has indeed played a role in stirring up trouble. But this stick has not knocked out people's ability to think independently. In fact, there have always been various voices in the middle of the monotonous tune, but the dogmatists have not heard or do not listen to them. Some editors, who are accustomed to living in boxes, like to revise other people's articles over and over again, and are only satisfied when they are revised to fit into the box, but the writers still want to crawl out of the box. Hitting with a stick may be useful the first time, but if you do it again, people will be prepared. Everyone knows that dogma is dead, and people are alive, so dogma cannot replace "independent thinking."

    In China, the majority of people are capable of independent thinking, and they have their own views on matters large and small. They are not accustomed to others thinking for them, but they are also not accustomed to publicly expressing their opinions, but they like to whisper in private (which helps the dogmatists' bluff). Therefore, the call for "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend" has a great effect on them. They need to "contend," and they should be encouraged to "contend" greatly. If they really "contend" greatly, the dogmatists' sticks will have to be put away.

    “独立思考”
    余一
    读了玄珠同志的“谈独立思考”，我有点感想。
    现在是不是我们就不知道怎样独立思考呢？现在是不是我们就丧失了独立思考的能力呢？
    我想，绝不是。我们并没有丧失独立思考的能力。
    问题在于：有些人自己不习惯“独立思考”，也不习惯别人“独立思考”。他们把自己装在套子里面，也喜欢硬把别人装在套子里面。他们拿起教条的棍子到处巡逻，要是看见有人从套子里钻出来，他们就给他一闷棍。他们听见到处都在唱他们听惯了的那种没有感情的单调的调子，他们就满意地在套子里睡着了。
    他们的棍子造成了一种舆论，培养出来一批应声虫，好像声势很浩大，而且也的确发生过起哄的作用。可是这种棍子并没有打掉人们的独立思考的能力。事实上单调的调子中间一直有各种各样的声音，不过教条主义者没有听见或者不去听罢了。有些在套子里住惯了的编辑同志喜欢把别人的文章改来改去，一定要改得可以装进套子才甘心，但是写稿的人仍然要从套子里钻出来。打闷棍，头一次也许有用处，要再来，别人早已提防了。谁都知道，教条是死的，人是活的，所以教条代替不了“独立思考”。
    在中国能够独立思考的人还是占大多数，他们对大小事情都有他们自己的看法。他们并不习惯别人代替他们思考，但是他们也不习惯公开发表自己的意见，却喜欢暗地里吱吱喳喳（这倒有助于教条主义者的虚张声势）。所以“百家争鸣”的号召对他们是有很大的作用的。他们需要“鸣”，也应当鼓励他们大“鸣”。要是他们真的大“鸣”起来，教条主义者的棍子就只好收起来了。
