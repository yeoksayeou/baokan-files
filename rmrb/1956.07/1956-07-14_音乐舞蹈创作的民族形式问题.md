Currently, in some of our music and dance creations, there is a bad phenomenon: a mix of Chinese and Western styles, neither Chinese nor Western, lacking a distinct national character. Therefore, many people ask: Why can't so many of our songs and dances become widely popular among the people? What is the reason for this? I think that in addition to reasons such as a lack of deep connection to life, and formulaic and conceptual approaches, it is because these works have not yet effectively used our national artistic forms to reflect our national character, psychology, and habits.

Today, the question of national form in music and dance creation essentially relates to the path and direction of music and dance development. On this issue, we must unswervingly delve into the treasures of Chinese national music and dance art, carefully select, discard the dross, protect and promote its beneficial parts, and, standing on this foundation, put in painstaking effort to create music and dance with a national form, socialist content, and a realistic approach. In terms of the troupe's professional training and program arrangement, we should neither belittle others nor be unduly humble, but rather consider and act on the principle of coexistence of Chinese and foreign elements, with the national element as the main focus.

Of course, this does not mean that we should not learn from foreign things. We must learn, and we must learn seriously. The reason is simple: both China and foreign countries have good things, and it should be acknowledged that there are many good things in the art of people from all countries. These good things play an important role in drawing lessons from them to develop our national art. In the past, we learned from foreign countries, especially from the art of our brotherly countries, and achieved many successes. This should be affirmed, and we must not abandon these achievements. Even in the future, we will still learn from the excellent art of people from all over the world and absorb nutrients from it to enrich ourselves. However, the current practice of mixing Chinese and Western styles, neither Chinese nor Western, and lacking a distinct national character, should be resolutely opposed.

Why? The reason is also very simple: because we are Chinese, and we are doing artistic work on Chinese soil. Our art should promote the excellent traditions of the Chinese people, enrich the ideals of the Chinese people, and strengthen the Chinese people's determination to struggle for socialism and communism. Our art must be of Chinese style, and be an art that is loved and welcomed by the broad masses of people (including the armed forces) and can inspire them to move forward.

Perhaps some people are worried: won't this make our art impoverished? I think it will not, on the contrary, it will greatly enrich it. Of course, it is wrong to oppose absorbing the essence of the art of foreign people in a general way. However, we must make it clear, what is the basis for the development of our art? Is it Western art? Or national art? Undoubtedly, it should be national art. We know that every nation has its own historical characteristics and lifestyle characteristics, therefore, in art, it will inevitably produce artistic forms that express the historical characteristics and lifestyle characteristics of its own nation. For example, the "Eighteen Farewell Scenes" of "Liang Shanbo and Zhu Yingtai," such an artistic form does not exist in the West. Why? Because the West does not have such a lifestyle characteristic as "Eighteen Farewell Scenes." When we watch Indian movies, whether it is "Two Acres of Land," "The Vagabond," or "Storm," we see an Indian movie once, and we still see an Indian movie twice. The reason is that it possesses the characteristics of the Indian nation. Taking the music of Indian movies as an example, because it is a national thing, it truly expresses the emotions and life characteristics of Indians. At first hearing, it seems unhealthy, but the more you listen, the more beautiful it feels, and you finally become intoxicated in it, but it does not weaken its strong highlighting and impact on the theme and characters of the movie. Instead, it is just right and complements each other, and is therefore widely welcomed and loved by the Chinese people. Looking back at the music in some of our movies? It is almost the same as the music in foreign movies. Such music is difficult for Chinese people to love. If Chinese people do not love it, will foreigners love it? I think foreigners will not love it either. Foreigners listen to your music, wanting nothing more than to understand the Chinese people through your music, but your music cannot truly express the emotions, style, and life characteristics of the Chinese people. How can this be loved by foreigners? Have we ever had such music? Nie Er, Xian Xinghai, and others have created a lot for us, which is worth our learning and promoting. Therefore, only by developing our music and dance creation on the basis of national art can we make our music and dance full of life and colorful; if we mix Chinese and Western styles, and forcibly transplant without regard to the national character, it can only destroy our national art and make our art impoverished.

Some comrades ask: Does such an emphasis on developing national things hinder ideological education for the troops? The answer is: no. We should first clarify what we are educating the troops about? Our education for the troops should be to educate the troops to move upwards, towards socialism, that is to say, we should educate the troops through vivid artistic images with national characteristics, using socialist thoughts and feelings. Therefore, as long as we can produce socialist realistic works, that is a very good education for the troops. Why should we use artistic works with strong national characteristics to educate the troops? The reason is: if our artistic works have strong national characteristics and can express the feelings, style, and life characteristics of our nation, it will influence the soldiers to love their own nation and improve their national self-esteem. We know that only those who truly respect their own nation will respect other nations and generate patriotism and internationalism. Moreover, only with national characteristics can the soldiers love it more and gradually receive education from the appreciation of art. Some comrades say: Are such artistic works lacking in combat effectiveness? I think: Combat effectiveness itself is mainly a question of ideology, that is, the question of so-called educational effect. As long as it is progressive art, no matter what artistic form it is, it has combat effectiveness. But some of our comrades now see it too narrowly, as if there is no combat effectiveness without fighting. For example, the "Lotus Dance," some people say it is "soft and lacks combat effectiveness." Does the "Lotus Dance" have combat effectiveness? I think it can be viewed this way: the "Lotus Dance" expresses the character of our nation that emerges from the mud without being stained, its optimistic mood and beautiful life ideals, it has its popular nature, and it is of educational significance to us, at least, it can arouse people's yearning for a better life and love for their own nation's life. Everyone, think about it, how can a person who does not love life and does not love his own nation talk about fighting for a better life?! Not only should we look at the "Lotus Dance" in this way, but when we watch ballet, such as "Swan Lake" and "Romeo and Juliet," we cannot vulgarly consider it solely from the form of ballet. "Swan Lake" expresses the people's ideals, expresses the people's yearning for good, their hatred for evil, and expresses the impact on dark forces, therefore, it fully shows its popular nature, thereby also expressing combat effectiveness. It is very clear that the form itself cannot explain whether there is combat effectiveness. Only by looking through the form and seeing what ideological content is given to the form can we determine the combat effectiveness of an artistic work. Some of us use the words "soft" to negate the national artistic form and say that the national artistic form has no combat effectiveness. This is not right. The most important thing is not to oppose the popular nature and combat effectiveness, and regard them as two different things. Everything that has a popular nature also has combat effectiveness.

Some comrades do not understand that the art of each nation has its own path of development, and therefore violate the laws of art development and forcibly transplant Western art. Today, a good study of the history of Chinese national art development will be beneficial to the development of our music and dance creation. Although our national art is very ancient, most of it reflects the life, hopes, and ideals of the people at that time, and is loved by the broad masses of people, and has a popular nature. Even the form is very open, the famous dancer Gongsun Da Niang of the Tang Dynasty described in Du Fu's poems is not a very clear example?

In recent years, our troops' artistic work has made some achievements, and these achievements are also inseparable from the entire people's art. For example, the former Southwest Military Region Cultural Troupe, because they went to the folk to collect a lot of things, were familiar with and mastered the national artistic form, coupled with their rich troops' emotions and life foundation, they were able to create excellent programs such as "Heroes Conquer the Dadu River" and "Tibetan Cavalry Dance." The reason why these programs are loved by the broad masses of people is because: it has both strong national characteristics and truly reflects the spiritual outlook of the troops. Therefore, to make our art truly an art that is loved by the troops and the people, it should be an art that uses the national artistic form to reflect the life and combat of the troops. Troops' artistic work can only be a part of the people's art, and there is no special troops' art outside of the people's art.

On the issue of developing national art, Mei Lanfang, Nie Er, Xian Xinghai, and folk artists such as Gao Yuanjun have set a brilliant example for us. We should study their artistic achievements. Why are some of the songs created by Nie Er, Xian Xinghai and other musicians of the same era so popular, so welcomed, and so inspiring? And why are the performances of Mei Lanfang and Gao Yuanjun so loved by the broad masses of people and troops' officers and soldiers? I think, mainly because their art has these characteristics: First, strong national characteristics, that is, listening to Xian Xinghai's symphony, Nie Er's "Golden Snake Dance," the national color is also very distinct, we look at Mei Lanfang's opera, that is even more needless to say. Second, strongly reflecting the characteristics of the era. Nie Er's "March of the Volunteers" (acting as the national anthem) and Xian Xinghai's "Yellow River Cantata" are generally recognized as strongly reflecting the era; even Mei Lanfang's "Cosmic Frontier" I think it also reflects one aspect of that era. Some of our comrades shout about the authenticity of art all day long, but from their works, they cannot hear the voice of the times or see the characteristics of the times. These works are often untrue and lack vitality. Third, with full popular nature and combat effectiveness. Needless to say, the works of Nie Er and Xian Xinghai fully reflect the ideals and hopes of the people; even Mei Lanfang's "Broken Bridge" and Gao Yuanjun's singing of "Wu Song," what is praised and what is opposed are also clearly defined, it also reflects the hopes and ideals of the people in the feudal era. As for Gao Yuanjun's singing of "A Cart of Sorghum Rice" is an even closer work that reflects real life. We should also see that their artistic achievements are inseparable from their diligent work and arduous creative spirit.

The path taken by Mei Lanfang, Nie Er, Xian Xinghai, and Gao Yuanjun in developing national art is undoubtedly correct. It should also become our path. In the future, we must strive to develop our national music and dance, that is to say, we must stand on the basis of national art with both feet. In this way, the artistic creation of our people (including the troops) can be truly developed and full of vitality.

So, what issues should we pay attention to in developing our national music and dance creation?

We often say that our music and dance creation should be rich in national style and national color. Of course, this is right, but how can it be considered rich in national style and national color? For example, dance, we cannot only understand it as a question of movement, but also should include national language, lifestyle, customs, character, social psychology, etc. Movement is to express these national lifestyle characteristics. When we create, we cannot but consider these national lifestyle characteristics. To make our works rich in national style and national color, we should carefully study national language, customs, and lifestyles.

When we advocate national art, we should of course also oppose blind use. It is very dangerous to blindly use it regardless of the content of life being expressed. The twisting of the neck in the Uygur dance, initially, is said to express the girl standing in the shed, looking at her lover outside through the fence of the shed, moving her neck left and right. Of course, it is good to express a girl's mood in this way, but now, some people do not study these things, and do not ask who it is, or what occasion it is, they always twist their necks. Another example is Sun Wukong in Peking Opera, he does twenty somersaults in one go, which is good in expressing the monkey character of Sun Wukong. But now, in some of our soldiers' dances, there is sometimes a series of somersaults, and the audience just shouts: "Skillful! Skillful!" Being skillful is completely necessary, and the skills obtained through this arduous training should be cherished, and its high artistic skill should be recognized; the problem is that abuse will destroy this high artistic skill, and it cannot properly express the spiritual outlook of the soldiers. The reason why this blind use is dangerous is because it cannot truly reflect life and cannot truly create artistic works with national style and national color.

Regarding the national style and national color in art, we should also look at it with a developmental point of view. We must not only oppose blind use, but also oppose conservative thinking. It should be seen that in our national art, there is the essence of popular nature, and there is also the dross of feudalism. We must be good at distinguishing and boldly discarding the dross. The "People's Daily" once criticized the dross in acrobatics. In acrobatics, such as walking on fire, swallowing fire, walking on broken glass, etc., it looks very thrilling, but it is actually harmful, so it should be resolutely removed. If we do not remove the dross in national art, and even move the "Ten Palaces of Yama," "frying in a pan of oil," etc. to the stage, then we are restoring the old and regressing.

Where is the key to doing a good job in national music and dance creation? I think the key lies in: whether we can use the national artistic form to concretely and truly reflect life, and use socialist thought to educate the people. On the point of educating the people with socialist thought, many comrades know it conceptually, but when they encounter specific problems, they become blurred. For example, in the song "Tank Soldiers and Tractor Drivers," there is this sentence: "We fight, just for you." It sounds as if our troops fight only for a girl who drives a tractor, which is of course untrue and lacks socialist thought. We changed this sentence to: "We fight, also for you." Here, although there is only one word difference between "just" and "also," there is a difference in ideology. This shows that to make our works rich in socialist thought, we must improve our ideological level and truly reflect life. The so-called true reflection of life, specifically speaking, is to use the national artistic form, through the true expression of the characters' character, thoughts, and feelings, to reflect the life and people of the class struggle.

There are still problems in the understanding of using national and folk art forms to express our troops. Taking dance as an example, although they are all studying national and folk things, some people still hold a skeptical attitude, saying "Can folk dance express the troops?" I think everyone should see this fact. The Chinese People's Liberation Army comes from the people, they are a part of the people, and have the same national characteristics and national psychology as the broad masses of people. For the national artistic form, they are also more familiar with it and easier to understand, just like the broad masses of people. Therefore, we can use national and folk dance to express combat and the life of soldiers. The reason why some comrades are not good at using national and folk art forms to express the life and combat of the troops is not because of the national and folk art forms, but because these comrades have not yet delved into it, and have not yet familiarized themselves with it and mastered it. There are very few people who have really put in a lot of effort in this regard. Are national and folk things scarce? Absolutely not. During the Spring Festival, our troops' dance training class went to eight provinces to collect materials, and found that our national and folk dances are very rich, some have already taken shape, and some can be used with a little processing. The same is true of the music. The problem is that we must go deep and study it. Since we have not studied the national artistic form very well, how can we use the national artistic form to express the life of the troops? Therefore, we should first delve into it and learn it seriously.

    音乐舞蹈创作的民族形式问题
    陈沂
    目前，在我们的有些音乐、舞蹈创作中，存在着一种不好的现象，这就是：中西混杂，不中不西，看不出民族的特色。所以好多人都问：为什么我们这样多的歌曲和舞蹈不能在人民中间广泛流行呢？这到底是个什么原因呢？我想除了生活不深、公式化概念化等等原因外，就是因为我们这些作品，还没有很好地运用我们民族的艺术形式反映出我们民族的性格、心理和习惯。
    在今天来说，音乐、舞蹈创作的民族形式问题，实质上就关系到音乐、舞蹈发展的道路问题和方向问题。在这个问题上，我们必须毫不动摇地深入到中国民族音乐、舞蹈艺术的宝藏中去，细心地选择，去其糟粕，保护和发扬其有益的部分，站在这个基础上，下苦功夫，去创造民族形式的、社会主义内容的、现实主义的音乐、舞蹈。在歌舞团的业务训练，节目安排等问题上，既不菲薄别人，也决不可妄自菲薄，应该本着中外并存，民族为主的原则去考虑、去做。
    当然，这并不是说我们就不要学习外国的东西，我们要学习，而且要认真的学习。道理很简单，就是中外都有好东西，而且应该承认：在世界各国人民的艺术中，好东西是很多的，这些好东西，对发展我们民族的艺术，有着重要的借鉴的作用。过去，我们学习外国，尤其是学习各兄弟国家人民的艺术，获得了不少成绩，这点应该肯定，我们决不能把这些成绩抛弃不要；而且就是在今后，我们也还是要向世界各国人民的优秀艺术学习，从中吸取营养来丰富我们自己。但是，目前这种中西混杂、不中不西、看不出民族特色的做法，应该坚决反对。
    为什么？道理也很简单，因为我们是中国人，是在中国的土地上做艺术工作，我们的艺术应该宣传中国人民的优秀传统，丰富中国人民的理想，并坚定中国人民为社会主义——共产主义而奋斗的志向。我们的艺术必须是中国气派，为广大人民（包括部队）所喜闻乐见而又能鼓舞他们前进的艺术。
    也许有些人很担心：这样不会使我们的艺术贫乏下去吗？我想是不会的，正相反，会大大的丰富起来。当然，笼统地反对吸取外国人民艺术中的精华，那是不对的。但是，我们必须弄清楚，发展我们艺术的基础是什么？是西洋艺术？还是民族艺术？毫无疑问，应该是民族艺术。我们知道，每个民族都有它自己的历史特点和生活特点，因此在艺术上，也就必然会产生表现本民族历史特点和生活特点的艺术形式。比如，像“梁山伯与祝英台”的“十八相送”，这样的艺术形式，在西洋就没有，为什么呢？因为西洋并没有像“十八相送”这样的生活特点。我们看印度电影，无论是“两亩地”、“流浪者”或者是“暴风雨”，看一遍是印度电影，看两遍还是印度电影。原因是它具备了印度民族的特点。单拿印度电影的音乐来说，因为它是民族的东西，它真实地表现了印度人的情感和生活特色，乍听去好像不健康，越听越觉得优美，终于沉醉在里头，但丝毫没有减弱它对电影主题和人物强烈的烘托和影响，倒是恰如其分，相得益彰，因而广泛地受到我国人民的欢迎和喜爱。回头再看看我们有些电影里的音乐呢？几乎跟外国电影里的音乐差不多。这样的音乐中国人是很难喜爱的。中国人不喜爱，那么外国人是否喜爱呢？我想外国人也是不会喜爱的。外国人听你的音乐，无非想通过你的音乐来了解中国人，可是你的音乐不能真实地表现中国人的情感、气派和生活特色，这怎么能叫外国人喜爱呢？我们是否也曾有过这样的音乐呢？聂耳、冼星海等就给我们创造了不少，深值我们去学习和发扬。因此，我们只有以民族艺术为基础来发展我们的音乐、舞蹈创作，才能使我们的音乐、舞蹈富有生命，丰富多彩；如果中西混杂，不中不西地硬搬，那只能破坏我们的民族艺术，使我们的艺术贫乏。
    有些同志问：这样强调发展民族的东西，是否妨害对部队的思想教育呢？回答是：不会。我们应该首先弄明确，我们对部队教育的是什么？我们对部队的教育，应该是教育部队向上、向社会主义，也即是说，我们应当通过鲜明的具有民族色彩的艺术形象，用社会主义的思想感情去教育部队。所以，只要我们能够拿出社会主义现实主义的作品，那就是对部队很好的教育。为什么要用具有浓厚民族色彩的艺术作品去教育部队呢？理由是：我们的艺术作品如果具有浓厚的民族色彩，能够表现我们民族的感情、气派和生活特色，那就会影响战士们去热爱自己的民族，提高民族自尊心。我们知道，只有真正尊重自己民族的人，才会尊重别的民族，并产生爱国主义和国际主义思想。而且，只有具有民族特色，战士们才能更喜爱，并从艺术的欣赏中，逐渐受到教育。有些同志说：这样的艺术作品是不是缺乏战斗性呢？我认为：战斗性的本身主要是个思想性问题，也就是所谓教育作用的问题。只要是进步的艺术，不论它是什么艺术形式，都具有战斗性的。而我们现在有些同志，实在把它看得太狭窄了，好像离开了打仗就没有战斗性。比如“荷花舞”，就有人说它“软绵绵，没有战斗性”。“荷花舞”有没有战斗性呢？我认为可以这样看：“荷花舞”所表现的我们民族的出污泥而不染的性格、乐观情绪和美好的生活理想，是有它的人民性的，对我们来说，是有教育意义的，至少，它能唤起人们对美好生活的向往以及对本民族生活的热爱。大家试想一想，一个人要是不热爱生活、不热爱自己的民族，他怎么能谈得到为美好生活而战斗呢？！不仅看“荷花舞”应该如此，我们看芭蕾舞，如“天鹅湖”、“柔密欧与幽丽叶”也不能庸俗地单从芭蕾舞的形式上来考虑，“天鹅湖”表现了人民的理想，表现了人民对善的向往，对恶的憎恨，表现了对黑暗势力的冲击，因而它就充分地显示了它的人民性，从而也就表现了战斗性。很清楚，形式的本身并不能说明有没有战斗性，只有透过形式，看赋予形式的思想内容如何，才能判明一个艺术作品的战斗性如何。我们有些人用“软绵绵”几个字，就否定了民族的艺术形式，说民族的艺术形式没有战斗性，这是不对的。最主要的是不要把人民性和战斗性对立起来，看成两回事，凡有人民性的东西，就同时具备战斗性。
    有些同志不懂得每个民族的艺术都有它自己发展的道路，因而违背了艺术的发展规律，去硬搬西洋的艺术。在今天来说，好好地研究一下中国民族的艺术发展历史，对于发展我们的音乐、舞蹈创作，那是会有好处的。我们民族的艺术，尽管很古老，但它大部分都反映了当时人民的生活、希望和理想，并为广大人民所喜爱，是具有人民性的。就是形式，也是非常开朗的，杜甫诗中所描写的唐代著名舞蹈家公孙大娘，不就是很明鲜的例子吗？
    几年来，我们部队的艺术工作作出了一些成绩，这些成绩，也是同整个人民艺术分不开的。例如过去的西南军区文工团，由于他们到民间去搜集了不少东西，熟悉和掌握了民族的艺术形式，加以他们丰富的部队情感和生活基础，因而他们才能创作出像“英雄们战胜了大渡河”“藏民骑兵舞”等优秀节目。这些节目所以为广大人民所喜闻乐见，就是因为：它既具有浓厚的民族色彩，而又真实地反映了部队的精神面貌。所以说，要使我们的艺术真正成为部队和人民喜闻乐见的艺术，那就应该使它成为运用民族艺术形式反映部队生活和战斗的艺术。部队艺术工作，只能是人民艺术的一部分，而不是在人民艺术之外，还有什么特殊的部队艺术。
    在发展民族艺术的问题上，梅兰芳、聂耳、冼星海以及民间艺人高元钧等，已经替我们树立了光辉的榜样。我们应该去研究一下他们的艺术成就。为什么聂耳、冼星海和其他同时代的一些音乐家所创作的一些歌曲，那么流行，那么受欢迎，那么鼓舞人心？又为什么梅兰芳以及高元钧等的表演，那么受广大人民和部队军官、士兵们的喜爱？我想，主要是因为他们的艺术具有这样一些特色：第一、浓厚的民族特色，就是听冼星海的交响乐，聂耳的“金蛇狂舞”，民族色彩也很鲜明，我们看梅兰芳的戏，那就更不用说了。第二、强烈地反映时代的特色。聂耳的“义勇军进行曲”（代国歌）、冼星海的“黄河大合唱”，大家都承认是很强烈地反映了时代的；就说梅兰芳的“宇宙锋”，我认为也是反映了那个时代的一个方面。我们有些同志整天喊艺术的真实性，可是从他们的作品中，却听不到时代的声音，看不到时代的特征，这些作品，往往是不真实的，缺乏生命力的。第三、具有充分的人民性和战斗性。不用说，聂耳和冼星海的作品，是充分地反映了人民的理想和希望的；就是梅兰芳所演的“断桥”、高元钧演唱的“武松”，歌颂什么，反对什么，也是爱憎分明的，它也是反映了封建时代人民的希望和理想的。至于高元钧演唱的“一车高粱米”就更是密切反映现实生活的作品了。我们还应该看到，他们之所以有这样的艺术成就，同他们辛勤的劳动和艰苦的创造精神也分不开。
    梅兰芳、聂耳、冼星海以及高元钧等，在发展民族艺术上所走的道路，无疑义是正确的。也应该成为我们的道路。今后，我们必须努力发展我们民族的音乐、舞蹈，即是说，我们必须把两只脚站在民族艺术的基础上。这样，我们人民（包括部队）的艺术创造才能获得真正的发展并富有生命力。
    那么，发展我们民族的音乐、舞蹈创作，应该注意些什么问题呢？
    我们经常说，我们的音乐、舞蹈创作，应该富有民族风格和民族色彩，当然这是对的，但是怎样才算富有民族风格和民族色彩呢？比如舞蹈，就不能光把它理解为动作问题，还应该包括民族的语言、生活方式、风俗习惯、性格、社会心理等。动作，是为了表现这些民族的生活特点的。我们在创作的时候，不能不考虑到这些民族的生活特点。要使我们的作品富有民族风格和民族色彩，就应该好好研究民族的语言、风俗习惯和生活方式等。
    我们提倡民族的艺术，当然也要反对盲目搬用，不问所表现的生活内容如何而盲目搬用是很危险的。维吾尔族舞蹈中的扭脖子，最初，据说是表现姑娘站在棚帐里，透过棚帐的篱墙看外面的爱人，把脖子左右地动一动，当然，这样表现一个姑娘的心情，是很好的，但是，现在有人并不研究这些东西，不问什么人，也不问什么场合，总是扭脖子。再如京戏里演孙悟空，一翻筋斗就翻二十来个，这在表现孙悟空的猴子的性格来说，它是好的。但现在，在我们一些战士舞蹈里，有时也是一连串的翻筋斗，看的人只是喊：“有本事！有本事！”有本事是完全应该的，对这种艰苦锻练得来的本事应该珍惜，并承认其高度艺术技巧；问题是滥用就会毁坏这种高度艺术技巧，就不能恰当的表现战士的精神面貌。这种盲目搬用之所以危险，就是因为它不能真实地反映生活，不能真正创造出具有民族风格和民族色彩的艺术作品。
    对于艺术中的民族风格和民族色彩，我们还应该用发展的观点去看，我们既要反对盲目搬用，也要反对保守思想。应该看到：在我们民族的艺术中，有人民性的精华，也有封建性的糟粕，我们要善于鉴别，大胆地把糟粕抛弃掉。“人民日报”就曾批评过杂技中的糟粕。在杂技中，如走火、吞火、走碎玻璃等等，看起来很惊险，实际上是有害的东西，所以应该坚决把它去掉。我们如果不把民族艺术中的糟粕去掉，连“十殿阎王”、“下油锅”等等，也一股脑儿都搬上舞台，那我们就是复古、就是倒退了。
    要搞好民族的音乐、舞蹈创作，关键在哪里呢？我认为，关键是在于：能否运用民族的艺术形式、具体真实地反映生活，用社会主义思想去教育人民。在用社会主义思想教育人民这一点来说，许多同志在概念上是知道的，可是一碰到具体问题，就模糊起来了。比如在“坦克兵和拖拉机手”这支歌子中，有这样一句：“我们战斗，就是为了你。”听起来，好像我们部队战斗，只是为了一位开拖拉机的姑娘，这当然是不真实的、是没有社会主义思想的。我们把这句话改成：“我们战斗，也是为了你”，这里，虽然只是“也”和“就”一字之差，可是在思想性上却有了差别。这说明，要使我们的作品富有社会主义思想，就必须提高自己的思想水平，去真实地反映生活。所谓真实地反映生活，具体点说，就是要运用民族的艺术形式，通过对人物的性格、思想感情的真实表现，去反映阶级斗争的生活和人。
    在运用民族、民间艺术形式表现我们部队这个问题的认识上，也还不是没有问题的。就拿舞蹈来说，虽然都在钻研民族，民间的东西，但有些人至今还抱着怀疑的态度，说“民间舞蹈”能不能表现部队？我想，大家应该看到这个事实，中国人民解放军是从人民中间来的，他们是人民的一部分，和广大人民具有共同的民族特征、民族心理。对于民族的艺术形式，他们也和广大人民一样，比较熟悉，比较容易理解。因此，可以运用民族、民间舞蹈去表现战斗和战士的生活。有些同志所以不善于运用民族、民间的艺术形式去表现部队的生活和战斗，这不能怪民族、民间的艺术形式，而是要怪这些同志还没有钻进去，还没有好好地熟悉它，掌握它。真正在这方面下一番工夫的人，可以说很少很少。是民族民间的东西贫乏吗？完全不是。春节期间，我们部队的舞蹈训练班到八个省去收集材料，发现我们民族的、民间的舞蹈非常丰富，有的已经成型，有的只要稍稍加工即可用。乐曲也是同样的情况。问题是必须去深入和研究。我们对民族的艺术形式，既然没有很好研究，又怎么能运用民族的艺术形式去表现部队的生活呢？所以，我们首先应该好好地钻进去，认真地学一学。
