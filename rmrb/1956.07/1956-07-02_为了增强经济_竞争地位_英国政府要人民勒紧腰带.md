Xinhua News Agency, 28th Dispatch from London: A British Information Service article broadcast a few days ago stated that the British economic situation had improved somewhat in the past six months.

The article pointed out that one indicator of improved conditions was the increase in gold and dollar reserves. Last year, reserves declined almost throughout the year, but in the first five months of this year, reserves increased by nearly $250 million.

In terms of trade deficits, the average monthly deficit for the first five months of this year was £51 million; in the whole of last year, the average deficit was £72 million. The article said that, in fact, the trade balance for May this year was the smallest in any month since November 1953.

The situation regarding international payments has also improved, changing from a deficit of £100 million last year to a surplus of approximately the same amount now.

The article pointed out that the British government had brought about the aforementioned changes after adopting a series of severe measures, the most important of which were the forced reduction of people's consumption and the freezing of workers' wages. "Personal consumption did not increase throughout last year. The demand for all consumer durables has decreased, including items such as washing machines, refrigerators, and automobiles." As for wages, the article said that the government's focus was to prevent wages from rising.

The article pointed out that the government took these measures with great effort to maintain Britain's "competitive position" in export markets and increase investment in the British Commonwealth.

However, the current economic situation still has "worrying" aspects, the article said. The most serious problems are the continued rise in prices and widespread demands for wage increases. In addition, "autumn is usually a difficult season," and the government's economic policies still need to be "tested" in the future.

    为了增强经济“竞争地位”
    英国政府要人民勒紧腰带
    新华社28日讯　伦敦消息：英国新闻处在几天前广播的一篇文章里说，英国经济情况在最近半年来有了一些改善。
    文章指出，情况好转的一个指标是黄金美元储备的增加。在去年，储备差不多在全年下降，但是在今年头五个月中，储备增加了近二亿五千万美元。
    在贸易逆差方面，今年头五个月每月平均逆差是五千一百万英镑；而在去年全年，平均逆差则是七千二百万英镑。文章说，实际上，今年五月的贸易差额是从1953年11月以来最小的一个月。
    国际收支方面的情况也有改进，已经从去年的一亿英镑赤字转为现在的数目大约相同的盈余。
    文章指出，英国政府是在采用了一系列严重措施之后才使上述情况有所改变的，这里面最主要的是强制缩减人民的消费量和冻结工人的工资。“个人消费去年全年没有上升。对所有消费用的耐用品的需要都已经减少，其中包括洗衣机和冰箱以及汽车之类的东西”。至于工资，文章说，政府注意的中心就是使工资不得上涨。
    文章指出，政府所以用大力采取这些措施，目的在于维持英国在出口市场上的“竞争地位”和增加对英联邦的投资。
    但是，目前的经济情况仍然有“令人担忧”的地方，文章说，最严重的问题是物价继续上涨和广泛的增加工资的要求。此外，“秋季通常是一个困难季节”，政府的经济政策还有待未来的“考验”。
