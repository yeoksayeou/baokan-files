Xinhua News Agency, Xining, July 18th: Relevant departments in Qinghai Province are taking active measures to improve transportation and material supply in the Qaidam Basin.

In late June, representatives from the Qaidam area attending the Second Congress of the Chinese Communist Party Qinghai Provincial Committee sharply criticized the shortcomings and problems in transportation and material supply there this year in their speeches. They pointed out that these shortcomings and problems had affected the progress of geological survey tasks and caused many difficulties in the lives of workers.

After the closing of the Congress, the Qinghai Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party immediately convened a meeting of responsible Party cadres from relevant departments to conduct a review and determine specific measures.

Currently, the transportation department is deploying forces to repair the two main highway lines in the Qaidam Basin to increase driving speed, reduce vehicle wear and tear, and shorten highway transportation mileage. In addition, it plans to supplement the Qaidam Transportation Company with automobiles allocated by the central government this year and prepare to establish small automobile repair shops in the basin.

The commercial department has begun to prepare for the establishment of three specialized institutions in the basin: trade, vegetables, and service. In areas with a high concentration of workers, it is preparing to set up retail departments of trade companies and add shops such as barbershops, tailors, watch repair shops, photo studios, shoe repair shops, restaurants, etc., as well as grain supply stations to ensure the supply of essential necessities for all workers in the basin for food, clothing, and use.

The Industry Department plans to expand coal mining in the basin to ensure the supply of industrial coal and domestic coal for workers in the basin this winter.

The postal and telecommunications departments have decided to set up additional institutions in the basin so that workers can quickly send their wages home. In addition, the Transportation Department is preparing to allocate vehicles to transport more than 100 tons of mail and parcels accumulated in Lanzhou and other places into the basin. At the same time, it has requested the central postal and telecommunications departments to allocate more postal vehicles to prevent the continued accumulation of large amounts of mail.

The cultural and health departments have also made plans to increase the number of books, newspapers, periodicals, and film copies, strengthen the prevention and treatment of workers' diseases, and prepare to send Peking Opera and Qinqiang Opera actors to perform in the basin.

    新华社西宁18日电　青海省有关部门正在采取积极措施，改进柴达木盆地的交通运输和物资供应工作。
    六月下旬，出席中共青海省第二次代表大会的柴达木地区代表在会上的发言当中，曾经尖锐地批评了今年以来那里交通运输和物资供应方面存在的缺点和问题，并且指出这些缺点和问题，已经影响了那里的地质勘测任务的进展，同时对职工的生活方面也造成了很多的困难。
    代表大会闭幕以后，中共青海省委立即召集有关部门的党员负责干部开会进行了检查，并且确定了具体的措施。
    目前，交通运输部门正在调配力量整修柴达木盆地的两条主要公路干线，以便提高行车速度，减少车辆损耗，缩短公路运输里程。另外，还计划把今年以内中央调拨的汽车充实柴达木运输公司，并且准备在盆地增设小型的汽车修理厂。
    商业部门已经着手在盆地筹建贸易、蔬菜、服务等三个专业机构；在职工较集中的地区，准备设立贸易公司门市部，并且增设理发、缝纫、修表、照相、补鞋、饭馆等商店，以及粮食供应站，保证盆地内全体职工吃、穿、用主要必需品的供应。
    工业厅计划扩大盆地内煤矿的开采量，以便保证今冬盆地的工业用煤和职工生活用煤。
    邮电部门决定在盆地增设机构，做到职工能够很快把工资寄往家中。另外，交通厅准备拨出汽车，把积压在兰州等地的一百多吨邮件、包裹运进盆地，同时要求中央邮电部门增拨邮车，防止大量邮件积压的现象继续发生。
    文化、卫生部门，也作出了增加书报刊物、电影拷贝，加强职工疾病防治工作的计划，并且准备派出京剧、秦剧演员到盆地演出。
