Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, July 23rd: Soviet higher education institutions will enroll 440,000 new students this year, of which 215,000 will be recruited from current employees. After entering the school, they will study at higher education institutions while continuing to work in enterprises.

    Soviet Minister of Higher Education, Yelyutin, said in an article recently published in "Pravda" that, starting this year, those who have participated in production after finishing secondary school and those who have been demobilized from the Soviet army have priority to enter universities.

    This new regulation for Soviet higher education institutions to enroll students is aimed at improving the quality of specialized personnel and work, and raising the requirements for higher education candidates and university students in their studies. Massively absorbing relatively mature young people who already have some life and production experience into higher education institutions is an important guarantee in this regard.

    At present, the number of graduates from Soviet higher education institutions basically meets the needs of various sectors of the national economy and culture and science. This year, higher education institutions have trained 265,000 young specialized personnel for the country. However, higher education institutions must further integrate the work of training specialists with production. Not long ago, the Soviet Council of Ministers approved new regulations on production internships for students in Soviet higher education institutions, designating a number of large and advanced enterprises across the country as places for students to go directly to the front line for production internships, so that they can thoroughly master their specialties there and establish an organic link between higher education institutions and production.

    Printing necessary textbooks for university students is particularly important for improving the training of specialized personnel. In the past three years, the Soviet Union has printed 888 kinds of university textbooks and reference books; the next five-year plan is to compile 1,865 kinds of textbooks. In this way, it can be ensured that higher education institutions have the necessary teaching materials in all major courses.

    苏联高等学校今年招生44万 
    二十多万职工将一面工作一面在高等学校学习
    新华社莫斯科23日电　苏联各高等学校今年将招收四十四万名新生，其中有二十一万五千人将从在职的工作人员中招收。他们入校后，将一面在高等学校学习，一面继续在企业中工作。
    苏联高等教育部长叶留金最近在“真理报”发表的一篇文章中说，从今年开始，那些读完中等学校以后参加生产的和从苏联军队中复员的人们，有进入大学的优先权。
    苏联高等学校录取学生的这种新规定，是为了改善专门人才和工作的质量，提高对高等学校考生和大学生在学习中的要求。而大量地把已经具有某些生活和生产经验的比较成熟的青年吸收到高等学校中来，是在这方面的一个重要的保证。
    现在，苏联高等学校毕业生的数量基本上适应国民经济和文化科学各个部门的需要。今年，高等学校又为国家培养出二十六万五千名青年专门人才。但是，高等学校还必须使培养专家的工作更加结合生产。不久以前，苏联部长会议批准了关于苏联高等学校学生生产实习的新条例，划出了全国一些大的先进企业，作为学生直接到现场去生产实习的地方，以便使他们在那里彻底掌握自己的专业，并且使高等学校和生产之间建立有机的联系。
    为大学生编印必需的教科书，对改善专门人才的培养工作是特别重要的。在过去三年中，苏联编印的大学教科书和参考书有八百八十八种；今后五年计划要编出一千八百六十五种教科书。这样，就可以保证高等学校在一切主要课程上得到必要的教材。
