    Linxiang County Formulates Jiangdi Flood Control Quotas
    (Our dispatch) The Jiangdi Flood Control Headquarters of Linxiang County, Hunan Province, in order to boost the morale of the workers and improve the efficiency of flood control work, recently held symposiums with dike and embankment cadres and workers to formulate flood control work quotas and compensation standards. First, flood control work was divided into five types: handling, material processing, rescue, equipment storage, and protection and transportation. Then, according to the weight, difficulty, technical level, and hardship of different types of work, as well as the required quantity and quality, and after repeated discussions with reference to historical data, the compensation standards for each type of work were determined. General work can be contracted according to quotas and paid on a piecework basis. For some complex work that is difficult to accurately determine in advance, such as work during tense flood control and rescue operations, a method of "fixed points, flexible evaluation" is adopted. As a result, the morale of the flood control workers has been greatly boosted, changing the past phenomenon of "late start, early end, low efficiency, much wasted work, and chaotic labor organization," achieving both flood control and field production without hindering each other. The flood control team has also become more robust. (Liu Jinkang)

    临湘县制定江堤防汛定额
    本报讯　湖南临湘县江堤防汛指挥部为了鼓舞民工情绪，提高防汛工效，最近分别召开了堤垸干部和民工座谈会，制定防汛工作定额和报酬标准。首先将防汛工种分为搬运、材料加工、抢险、收藏器材、防护运输等五种类型，然后按照不同工种的轻重、难易、技术高低与辛苦程度，以及所要求的数量质量，参考历史资料反复讨论，确定各工种的报酬标准。一般的活都可以根据定额包工，按件计酬，对一些事先难于定准的复杂活如防汛抢险紧张时的工作活动等，则采用死分活评的办法。这样，防汛民工情绪高涨，改变了过去“出工迟、收工早、工效低、窝工多、劳动组织混乱”的现象，做到防汛和田间生产两不误。防汛队伍也更加健全了。　（刘锦康）
