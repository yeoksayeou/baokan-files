    Beijing Drama and Literary Circles
    Discuss Classical Play "Pipa Ji"

    (Our newspaper dispatch) The Chinese Dramatists Association held consecutive symposiums on June 28th and 29th, inviting figures from the drama and literary circles in Beijing to discuss the classical play "Pipa Ji" (The Story of the Lute).

    At the first discussion meeting, Tian Han, Chairman of the Chinese Dramatists Association, introduced the various opinions held by Chinese literary and art circles over the years regarding this classical play and its author, Gao Zecheng. For example, some people believe that this play promotes "filial sons and virtuous wives," is a work that teaches loyalty and filial piety, and aims to advocate feudal morality. Some people believe that this play reflects the suffering of the people in feudal society under conditions of natural and man-made disasters. Through the tragic experiences of the male and female protagonists, it profoundly exposes the crimes of the feudal system and is a work with popular appeal and profound realism. Some people believe that Gao Zecheng changed the unfaithful and unfilial Cai Bojie in folk legends into a completely loyal and filial character in "Pipa Ji," which is a typical example of feudal scholar-bureaucrats tampering with folk legends. Some people believe that Gao Zecheng broke through the artistic prejudices of scholar-bureaucrats, adopted folk legends to write the script, and he was a playwright with great contributions, etc.

    Over the two days, Shang Yue, Huang Zhitong, Liu Feizhang, Guo Mingyi, Zhou Yibai, Pu Jiangqing, Bai Yunsheng, Chen Youqin, Li Changzhi and others spoke at the meeting. Historian Shang Yue briefly reported on the historical background of the late Yuan and early Ming dynasties when "Pipa Ji" was produced. Liu Feizhang, Deputy Director of the Hunan Provincial Cultural Bureau, introduced the controversies in the reorganization and adaptation of the Xiang opera "Pipa Ji" and the audience's reactions. Guo Mingyi of the Sichuan Provincial Sichuan Opera Theater introduced the performance of "Pipa Ji" in Sichuan Opera. Other speakers touched on various aspects such as the historical background of the play's creation, the playwright Gao Zecheng's thoughts, and the play's ideology and artistry.

    The discussion will continue. Participants in the discussion believe that this kind of discussion will have guiding significance for drama creation and how to accept the legacy of national drama.

    北京戏剧界文学界人士
    讨论古典名剧“琵琶记”
    本报讯：　中国戏剧家协会在六月二十八日、二十九日连续举行座谈会，邀请在北京的戏剧界和文学界人士讨论古典名剧“琵琶记”。
    在第一次讨论会上，中国戏剧家协会主席田汉介绍了多年来中国文艺界人士对这个古典名剧和它的作者高则诚的各种不同的见解。例如：有些人认为这出戏标榜“子孝共妻贤”，是教忠教孝的作品，目的在于提倡封建道德。有些人认为，这出戏反映了封建社会中人民在天灾人祸境况下的苦难，它通过男女主角悲剧性的遭遇深刻地揭露了封建制度的罪恶，是一部具有人民性和深刻的现实主义的作品。有些人认为，高则诚把民间传说中不忠不孝的蔡伯喈在“琵琶记”中改为全忠全孝的人物，是封建士大夫窜改民间传说的典型。有些人认为，高则诚冲破士大夫的艺术偏见，采用民间传说写成了剧本，他是一位有很大贡献的剧作家。等等。
    两天来，在会上先后发言的有尚钺、黄芝同、刘斐章、郭铭彝、周贻白、浦江清、白云生、陈友琴、李长之等人。历史学家尚钺扼要地报告了产生“琵琶记”的元末明初的时代背景；湖南省文化局副局长刘斐章介绍了湘剧“琵琶记”整理改编中的争论以及观众的反应；四川省川剧院的郭铭彝介绍了“琵琶记”在川剧中的上演情况。其他的发言者则接触到了剧本产生的时代背景，剧作者高则诚的思想以及剧本本身的思想性、艺术性等各方面。
    讨论会将要继续举行。参加讨论会的人都认为：这种讨论会对戏剧创作和如何接受民族戏剧遗产问题都会有指导意义。
