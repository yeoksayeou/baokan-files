Building a Reservoir in the Lower Reaches of the Liao River

(Our newspaper dispatch) A flatland reservoir is under construction in the Rongxing area of the lower reaches of the Liao River.

In the past, the lower reaches of the Liao River often experienced periodic dry years. In dry years, seawater would flow back into the Liao River estuary, increasing the salinity of the river water, making it impossible to draw water for irrigation in this area. Upon completion of this project, 80,000 mu of farmland will be protected from the harm of dry years, ensuring a good harvest. It will also be possible to raise 150,000 fish in the reservoir, producing over 70,000 kilograms of fresh fish annually.

The entire earth dam will have a circumference of over 7,200 meters, covering an area of over 4,500 mu, with a storage capacity of 1,258 metric tons. It is expected to store water and be ready for use in the spring of 1957. (Wang Nanxiang)

    辽河下游兴建蓄水库
    本报讯　辽河下游荣兴地区正动工兴建一座平地蓄水库。
    过去辽河下游常发生周期性枯水年。每遇枯水年，辽河河口海水倒灌，河水含盐量增加，这个地区即不能抽水灌溉。这项工程完工后，即可使八万亩农田不受枯水年的危害，丰收保产，并能利用水库养鱼十五万尾，年产鲜鱼七万多公斤。
    全库土坝周长七千二百多公尺，占地四千五百多亩，蓄水量1，258公吨，预计在1957年春季蓄水备用。　　　　　（王南翔）
