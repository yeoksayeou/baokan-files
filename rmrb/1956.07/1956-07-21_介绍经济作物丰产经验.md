    Beijing News - The General Bureau of Economic Crop Production of the Ministry of Agriculture has compiled a series of small booklets introducing advanced experiences in high yields of economic crops from across the country. These will be published in separate volumes by Popular Reading Publishing House in early August. This series of booklets includes five books on cotton, flue-cured tobacco, tea, bast fiber crops, and sugarcane, all compiled with the high-yield experiences in planting and production of the aforementioned technical crops in various regions in recent years. For example, the "Cotton High-Yield Experience" book introduces the large-scale high-yield cotton planting experience of the Manas River Farm in Xinjiang, as well as the cotton planting experience of the First Agricultural Production Cooperative of Hainan Township, Simen District, Cixi County, Zhejiang, which has the highest cotton yield per unit area in the country. This series of books selects a wide range of materials, including both high-yield examples from the northern regions and high-yield examples from the southern regions, and provides specific introductions to technical measures for increasing the production of economic crops, which can be used as reference for agricultural departments and agricultural production cooperative personnel in various regions.
