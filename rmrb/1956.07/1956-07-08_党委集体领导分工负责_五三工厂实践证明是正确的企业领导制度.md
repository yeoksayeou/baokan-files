Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, July 5th: The nationally renowned Factory 53, at a recent symposium on examining the enterprise leadership system, affirmed the experience of the Party Committee collective leadership with individual responsibility system, believing that this enterprise leadership system can fully mobilize the enthusiasm of all employees.

　　After Factory 53 ended the military representative system in 1950, it strengthened the Party Committee's collective leadership in enterprise management. On major issues such as formulating national production plans, trial-producing new products, promoting cadres, and carrying out production competitions and political movements, it has always gone through collective discussions by the Party Committee to unify thinking, unify steps, and finally make decisions, with the Party, administration, trade union, and Communist Youth League dividing responsibilities to implement them. In 1953, Factory 53 summarized the political work experience of the Party's collective leadership and mass line in enterprise leadership, and this experience has been widely promoted throughout the country.

　　However, after Factory 53 began to study the experience of the one-leader system in enterprise leadership at the end of 1953, some administrative leaders emphasized their individual authority and neglected the Party's collective leadership, resulting in commandism, which severely hampered the enthusiasm of the workers. For example, when drafting the 1956 national plan in September last year, the factory director ordered the cadres of various departments and workshops to quickly carry out the drafting work without prior collective discussion by the Party Committee. Because the cadres of the Party, trade union, and Communist Youth League in various departments and workshops had not gone through the unified arrangement of the Party Committee in advance, they each did their own thing, so that the drafting work could not be carried out a week after the order was issued, causing confusion. At this time, the cadres of the Party, trade union, and Communist Youth League raised opinions on the fact that the Party Committee had not uniformly arranged this important task. The factory Party Committee, based on the opinions of the masses, re-discussed and uniformly arranged the work of formulating the plan, and the cadres of the Party, administration, trade union, and Communist Youth League mobilized the masses according to the decision of the factory Party Committee, and as a result, the entire factory completed the task of formulating the plan ahead of schedule.

　　In promoting the experience of the one-leader system in enterprise leadership, Factory 53 adjusted the management structure and implemented systems such as fixed positions and staffing, final accounts meetings, and operation meetings. Some administrative management systems have played a certain role in organizing production, but they have also brought tendencies of commandism and formalism to the factory's administrative leaders. For example, at the operation meeting presided over by the factory director, only the factory director was allowed to order, question, and criticize, and workshop directors and section chiefs were not allowed to state reasons, and grassroots cadres said: "This is a one-sided lawsuit." Once, at an operation meeting, the factory director, regardless of the actual strength, subjectively ordered the director of the fourth workshop to make thousands of wooden boxes in a short period of time. Because the director of the fourth workshop had no right to state the reasons for not being able to complete the task, he had to reluctantly accept the task. As a result, the wooden boxes were not delivered on time, affecting the packaging of the products.

　　When the Party Committee of Factory 53 studied the resolution of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, it severely criticized some of the tendencies of administrative leaders to neglect the Party's collective leadership and commandism; in terms of administrative management systems, it also paid attention to criticism and supervision from the workers. The Party Committee improved various systems and strengthened collective leadership. In the advanced producer movement, the leading organs required that the cost of Factory 53's products in 1956 should be reduced by 7.3% compared with last year. The administrative leaders had no confidence in completing it and advocated that it could only be reduced by 5.2%. When the Party Committee discussed this task at an enlarged meeting, based on the previously investigated material consumption quotas and the excessive material on workshop management fees, the Party Committee made a decision to continue to reduce the cost target. The Party, administration, trade union, and Communist Youth League, according to the decision, mobilized the masses separately and gathered the workers' rationalization proposals; finally, the cost target was reduced to 14.31%.

　　The experience of Factory 53 in affirming the Party Committee's collective leadership with individual responsibility system has been proven by years of practice.

### 党委集体领导分工负责  五三工厂实践证明是正确的企业领导制度

    党委集体领导分工负责
    五三工厂实践证明是正确的企业领导制度
    据新华社沈阳5日电　全国著名的五三工厂在最近检查企业领导制度的座谈会上，肯定了党委集体领导分工负责制的经验，认为这种企业领导制度能够充分发挥全体职工的积极性。
    五三工厂在1950年结束了军事代表制度以后，在企业领导上就加强了党委集体领导，在制定国家生产计划、试制新产品、提拔干部以及开展生产竞赛和政治运动等重大问题上，一直都通过党委集体讨论，统一思想，统一步调，最后作出决定，由党、行政、工会、青年团分工负责，贯彻执行。在1953年，五三工厂总结了党在企业领导中的集体领导和群众路线等政治工作经验，这个经验已在全国普遍推广。
    但是，五三工厂在1953年底开始学习一长制的企业领导经验以后，有些行政领导干部强调个人的职权，忽视了党的集体领导，产生了命令主义的现象，严重地束缚职工群众的积极性。如去年九月编制1956年国家计划草案的时候，厂长事先不经党委集体讨论就命令各科室和车间干部迅速进行编制工作。各科室和车间的党、工会、青年团干部，因为事先没有经过党委的统一安排，各搞一套，以致命令下达一周以后，编制工作还无法进行，造成混乱。这时候，党、工会、青年团的干部对党委没有统一布置这项重要工作，纷纷提出意见。工厂党委会根据群众的意见，重新讨论和统一布置了编制计划的工作，党、行政、工会和青年团干部按照工厂党委的决定，分头发动群众，结果全厂提前完成了编制计划的任务。
    在推行一长制的企业领导经验中，五三工厂调整了管理机构，实行了定职定员、决算会议和作业会议等制度。有些行政管理制度在组织生产上曾起到一定作用，但也给工厂行政领导干部带来了命令主义和形式主义的倾向。如在厂长主持的作业会议上，只许厂长命令、追问和批评，不许车间主任和科长申述理由，基层干部说：“这是打一面官司。”有一次，在作业会议上，厂长不顾实际力量，主观地命令四车间主任在短时间内做出几千个木箱，由于四车间主任无权申述完不成任务的理由，只得勉强接受任务，结果，木箱没有按期交出，影响了产品的包装。
    五三工厂党委会在学习中共七届四中全会决议的时候，对行政领导干部存在的一些忽视党的集体领导和命令主义倾向，进行了严厉的批判；在行政管理制度上，也重视了来自职工群众的批评和监督。党委会健全了各种制度，加强了集体领导。在先进生产者运动中，领导机关要求五三工厂1956年产品的成本要比去年降低7.3％，行政领导干部没信心完成，主张只能降低5.2％。党委在扩大会议上讨论这项任务的时候，根据事先调查得来的原材料消耗定额和车间管理费用过多的材料，党委会作出继续降低成本指标的决定。党、行政、工会和青年团，根据决定分头发动群众，汇集了职工的合理化建议；最后，成本指标降低到14.31％。
    五三工厂肯定党委集体领导分工负责制的经验，是从几年来的实践中得到证明的。
