    New Life in Socialist Countries
    The Horak Family Has Plenty of Income
    Horak, a miner from Ostrava, Czechoslovakia, has a happy family. With the recent birth of their third child, the family will have five members. Horak's monthly salary is 3,000 crowns, plus a family allowance of 310 crowns. After paying taxes of 220 crowns, their net monthly income is 3,090 crowns. Their family budget, in addition to food, rent, utilities, clothing, transportation, tobacco, newspapers, entertainment, and other living expenses, allows them to save 650 crowns (including 550 crowns for purchasing durable goods).
    The Horak family is now planning to buy a television. Because once the third child is born, going to the theater will be more difficult than before, and a television can largely meet the family's entertainment needs. A Czechoslovak-made single-tube television costs only 2,000 crowns, which means that four or five months of savings can fulfill their wish.
    Like other families in Czechoslovakia, the Horak family enjoys free medical care. Their children also have the right to free mountain vacations at school, and Horak himself can receive union subsidies to spend his vacation in picturesque sanatoriums. A stable job and regular, stable income guarantee the Horak family a peaceful and happy life.
    Fierka's Comfortable Retirement
    For forty-four years, mechanic Luga Fierka worked by the blast furnace at the Resita Metallurgical Factory in Romania. According to the Romanian government's regulations, he has reached retirement age, but he is reluctant to leave his work, leave the blast furnace, and leave the partners he has worked with for many years. Only after repeated advice from doctors did he accept this decision.
    On his last day saying goodbye to his colleagues at the factory and returning home, Fierka couldn't help but think about many things: "What will life be like in the future? Besides, pensions and wages are two different things, will I be a burden to my son in the future?" His son, Rong, is also a mechanic at the factory.
    But Fierka immediately dispelled his worries. It turned out that according to national regulations, after retirement, the pension he receives is equal to 80% of his average monthly salary for the past year. When the postman delivered his pension for the first time, Fierka joked, "Look, I've become a 'private property eater' in my old age! I haven't done anything, but money is delivered to my door every month!"
    Fierka also likes to keep busy at home. Either building a pigsty for the newly bought piglets, tidying up the fence in the garden next to the house, or repairing the little tricycle for his grandson, Pi You. Fierka's pension is more than enough each month, so he always likes to use the remaining money to buy things for his family.
    Although Fierka lives a retired life at home, he still knows a lot about what's happening at the factory. After his son gets off work and returns home, he always brings him news from the factory. Sometimes, the workers from the factory also often come to his house to visit this old friend or ask him for advice on some production issues.
    The Happy Girls of Pecel Village
    The people of Pecel Village in Hungary are very excited. Adelka, the most beautiful girl in the village, is getting married. Everyone in the village is proud of Adelka. She is the fiftieth girl from this village to get married this year. Fifty brides in a small village in less than a year is quite a number. Before the war, the marriage registry at the village office had never issued so many marriage certificates in any year. In 1945, only 37,000 people got married throughout Hungary. After liberation, people's lives have greatly improved, and in 1955 alone, the number increased to 110,000.

    社会主义国家的新生活
    霍拉克一家收入充裕
    捷克斯洛伐克的俄斯特拉发的矿工霍拉克有一个美满的家庭，在第三个小孩最近出世以后，家里就要有五口人了。霍拉克每月的工资收入是三千克朗，另外还有三百一十克朗的家庭津贴，除了缴纳税款二百二十克朗外，每月净入三千零九十克朗，他们的家庭预算，除了食物，房租、水电、煤气、衣着、车费、烟酒、报刊、文娱和其他生活费用之外，还能储蓄六百五十克朗（其中包括购买耐用品的款项五百五十克朗）。
    现在霍拉克一家正在计划购置一部电视机。因为等到第三个孩子一出生，要想到剧院去看看戏就会比从前更困难了，而电视机则可以在很大程度上满足一家的文娱需要。捷克斯洛伐克国产的单管电视机只需两千克朗，也就是说，四、五个月积蓄所得就可以实现他们的愿望了。
    像捷克斯洛伐克的其他家庭一样，霍拉克一家也享有免费的医疗，他们的孩子们，还可以在学校里得到免费去山间休假的权利，而霍拉克自己也可以得到工会的补助去风光绮丽的疗养胜地度过自己的假期。固定的职业和经常的稳定的收入，保证了霍拉克一家安定的幸福的生活。
    费尔卡安乐的晚年
    机械工卢加·费尔卡在罗马尼亚的赖西察冶金工厂的鼓风炉旁已经干了四十四年活了。按照罗马尼亚政府的规定，他已到了退休的年龄，但是他却舍不得离开自己的工作，离开鼓风炉，离开多年来一起干活的伙伴。经过医生的多次忠告，他才接受了这个决定。
    在最后一天告别厂里的伙伴回家去的时候，费尔卡的心里不禁想起了不少问题：“以后的生活将会变成什么样呢？再说，养老金和工资是两回事，以后会不会增加儿子的负担呢？”他的儿子荣也在厂里当机械工。
    但是费尔卡马上就打消了自己的顾虑，原来按照国家的规定，在退休之后他得到的养老金等于他过去一年内所得的每月平均工资的80％，当邮递员第一次把养老金给他送来的时候，费尔卡开着玩笑说：“你看，我晚年倒成了一个‘吃私产’的人了，什么也没有干，钱倒每个月都送上门来！”
    费尔卡在家里也是喜欢忙忙碌碌的。不是给新买的小猪修个猪圈，就是把宅旁花园的篱笆整顿整顿，或者给孙儿皮佑修修小三轮车。费尔卡的养老金每月都绰绰有余，因此他总喜欢把剩下来的钱给家里人添置些东西。
    费尔卡虽然在家里过着退休的生活，但是他对厂里的事情，仍然知道得不少。儿子下班回家以后，总要把厂里的新闻带给他。有时候厂里的工人也常来他家作客，探望探望这位老友，或向他请教一些生产上的问题。
    幸福的佩采尔村的姑娘们
    匈牙利的佩采尔村的人们非常兴奋。村子里最漂亮的姑娘艾德尔卡要结婚了。村子里每一个人都因艾德尔卡而感到骄傲，她是今年本村里出嫁的第五十个姑娘。小小的村子里，不到一年就有五十个新娘，这个数目真算不小了。战前无论那一年，村公所的婚姻登记处从来没有发出过这么多结婚证书。1945年那年，匈牙利全国只有三万七千人结婚。解放后人民生活大大提高了，在1955年一年中却增加到了十一万人。
