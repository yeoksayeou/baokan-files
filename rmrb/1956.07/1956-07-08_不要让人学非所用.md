    Don't Let People Learn Something They Can't Use
    I know a cadre who studied accounting in school, and he himself is eager to delve into accounting business. Who knew that after starting work, he was assigned to the personnel department. Moreover, his work is constantly changing. He was first transferred to the materials section, then to the warehouse, then to the finance section, then to the construction management section, and then to the contract section... Now, this cadre says with a wry smile when he sees acquaintances, "I've become a 'jack-of-all-trades'!" The departments managing cadres should listen to this voice, don't let cadres learn something they can't use, don't easily transfer cadres' work, so that cadres have worked for a long time and still have no expertise.

    不要让人学非所用
    我认识一个干部，在学校是学会计的，他自己也有志于钻研会计业务。谁知参加工作以后，却被安排到了人事部门。而且他的工作不断在变动，开始被调到材料科，接着又调到仓库，又调到财务科，又调到施工管理科，又调到合同科……现在，这个干部见了熟人就苦笑着说，我已经变成个“四不像”了！管理干部的部门应该听听这个呼声，不要让干部学非所用，不要轻易调动干部的工作，使干部作了很久的工作，还是一无所长。
