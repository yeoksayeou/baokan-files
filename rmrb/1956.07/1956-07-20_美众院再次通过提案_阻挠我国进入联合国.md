Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 19th - The United States House of Representatives passed a proposal on July 18th, once again stating its intention to prevent the People's Republic of China from entering the United Nations.

The report accompanying the proposal opposing the admission of China into the United Nations stated: "The passage of this bill will demonstrate to everyone that the United States will consider the admission of the Chinese Communist regime as the representative of China to the United Nations or any of its specialized agencies as a serious matter."

This action by the House of Representatives is the eleventh time in recent years that the House of Representatives or the House Foreign Affairs Committee has formally expressed its intention to prevent China from entering the United Nations. Congressman Judd, in explaining why the House of Representatives tirelessly took action again at this time, admitted that this was to cope with the increasing pressure inside and outside the United Nations to allow China to enter.

    美众院再次通过提案
    阻挠我国进入联合国
    新华社19日讯　华盛顿消息：美国众议院七月十八日通过了一项提案，再次表示要阻止中华人民共和国进入联合国。
    随同反对接纳中国进入联合国的提案提出的报告说：“通过这个议案将是向一切人表明，美国将认为接纳中国共产党政权作为中国的代表参加联合国或者它的任何专门机构是一个严重的问题。”
    众议院采取这个行动是最近几年来众议院或者众议院外交委员会正式表示要阻止中国进入联合国的第十一次行动。众议员周以德在解释众议院所以不厌其烦地在目前再次采取行动时承认，这是为了应付联合国内外要求让中国进入的日益增长的压力。
