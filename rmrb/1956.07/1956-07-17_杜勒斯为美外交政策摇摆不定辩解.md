Xinhua News Agency, July 16th, New York Dispatch: Dulles, in a speech delivered in New York on July 15th, said that foreign policy is like a sailboat and requires "many adjustments to the sails" to reach its destination. Dulles made these remarks in response to criticisms from various quarters about the wavering nature of American foreign policy. Dulles said, "After we have identified our goals, even if the wind is hindering us, we must find ways to achieve that goal, which requires many adjustments to the sails." He said that those who do not know how to sail probably do not understand that a straight line between two points is not necessarily the fastest route.

The U.S. Secretary of State once again called on both houses of Congress in his speech to restore the "foreign aid" appropriations that had been cut.

On the same day, Dulles wrote an article for the church magazine "The Ecumenical Review," published in Geneva, in which he spoke about American foreign "aid":

    "There is a danger in giving large amounts of economic aid to countries whose governments are unstable or whose social forms do not conform to our own. But it is an abdication of responsibility if needed and deserved help is not given, or if some conditions are attached to such help that make it unacceptable or repugnant."

Dulles said that the United States "must run calculated risks when it chooses between actions that maintain peace and actions that defend values that make peace worthwhile." He also said, "Freer mutual visits run the risk of being used for propaganda purposes, but if we do not run that risk, we appear to lack confidence in the strength of our own heritage."

    杜勒斯为美外交政策摇摆不定辩解
    新华社16日讯　纽约消息：杜勒斯七月十五日在纽约发表的一篇演说里说，外交政策就像一条帆船一样，需要“很多次调整帆索”才能达到目的地。杜勒斯发表这些意见，是为了回答各方面对于美国外交政策摇摆不定的批评。杜勒斯说：“在我们认定目标以后，尽管风力阻挠着我们，我们一定要找出办法来达到那个目标，这就需要很多次调整帆索。”他说，不懂驾驶船的人大概不明白两点之间的直线并不一定是最快的航线。
    这位美国国务卿在演说里再一次呼吁国会两院恢复被削减掉的“援外”拨款。
    杜勒斯在同一天替在日内瓦出版的一家教会杂志“全基督教评论”写的一篇文章里谈到美国的对外“援助”说：
    “对那些它们的政府并不稳定，或者是它们的社会形态不符合我们自己的看法的国家，给予大量的经济援助是有危险的。但是，如果不给予所需要的和值得给予的帮助，或者是在这些帮助里附上一些使这些帮助成为不能接受的或令人作呕的条件限制，这是背弃了责任。”
    杜勒斯说，美国在“维护和平的行动和保卫使和平值得的价值的行动之间进行选择的时候，必须冒意料中的危险。”他又说：“更自由的相互访问有被用来进行宣传的危险，但是如果不冒这样的危险，我们看起来就好像对我们自己的遗产的力量缺乏信心。”
