    Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, 20th—The Zini Agricultural Production Cooperative is helping commune members with life difficulties overcome those difficulties.

    The total summer income of the Zini Agricultural Cooperative in Longxi County, Fujian Province, reached 81,300 yuan, an increase of 1.8 times over last year. According to the principle of "less deduction, more distribution" and "payment according to labor," the cooperative distributed 68.6% of the total income to its members. Among the 302 households in the cooperative, 288 households saw a significant increase in income, 8 households saw no increase or decrease, and 5 households saw a decrease in income. The local area suffered severe disasters last year, and the commune members had little savings. After the distribution, 39 households still had difficulties because their income increased less, 13 households saw no increase or decrease in income or a decrease. Therefore, the cooperative's management committee, in accordance with the cooperative's charter, helped them overcome difficulties based on their different situations. For the seven members who were lonely, widowed, orphaned, and disabled, who had no labor power, they were given "five guarantees" treatment, and rice and vegetable money were first issued from the public welfare fund; for the ten households of revolutionary martyrs and military families who lacked labor power and whose income did not increase much or decreased and had living difficulties, they were given preferential labor days based on the work points that the entire cooperative's labor force should bear for substitute farming; for the 35 households of members who had labor power but were lazy or did not actively work for other reasons and had living difficulties, on the one hand, they were educated and helped to formulate plans to increase work attendance in the second half of the year, and on the other hand, they were given an advance payment of 536 labor days of remuneration, which would be settled during the autumn distribution, with any overpayment or underpayment being adjusted. After the preferential treatment and advance payment, the three households of revolutionary martyrs and military families and the ten households of advance payment recipients who still had difficulties were further subsidized by the agricultural cooperative with 1,867 catties of grain and more than 130 yuan in cash from the public welfare fund, so that all their difficulties were resolved.
    The result of giving care to households in difficulty according to their actual situation has satisfied both members with and without living difficulties.

    帮助社员克服生活困难
    新华社福州20日电　紫泥农业生产合作社帮助生活有困难的社员克服困难。
    福建省龙溪县紫泥农业社夏季总收入达八万一千三百多元，比去年增加一点八倍。根据“少扣多分”“按劳取酬”的原则，社里把总收入的68.6％分配给社员。全社三百零二户社员中，有二百八十八户社员收入有了较显著的增加，八户不增不减，五户减少收入。当地去年受灾较重，社员家底薄，在分配以后，全社还有三十九户收入增加较少、十三户收入不增不减和减少收入的社员生活仍有困难。因此，社管理委员会按照社章规定，根据他们的不同情况分别帮助他们克服困难。对七户没有劳力的孤寡鳏独和残废的社员给以“五保”待遇，从公益金中先发给稻谷和菜金；对十户缺乏劳力、收入增加不多或减少而生活有困难的烈属和军属，便根据全社劳动力应负担的代耕工分，给予优待劳动日；对于有劳动力，但由于偷懒或其他原因未积极出工而生活有困难的三十五户社员，一方面教育和帮助他们分别订出下半年增加出工的计划，一方面预借给他们五百三十六个劳动日的报酬，到秋季分配时再行结算，多还少补。经过优待和预借后生活仍有困难的三户烈军属和十户预借户，再由农业社从公益金中抽出一千八百六十七斤谷子和一百三十多元现金给予补助，使他们的困难全部得到解决。
    根据实际情况分别给予困难户以照顾的结果，不论生活有无困难的社员都很满意。
