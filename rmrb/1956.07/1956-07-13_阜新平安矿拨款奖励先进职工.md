Xinhua News Agency, Fuxin, 11th. The Fuxin Pingan Mine has decided to allocate 6,197 yuan from the enterprise fund to reward the 492 advanced producers and 49 advanced collective units that have recently been selected. In the first half of this year, the total amount of bonuses issued to employees by this mine has reached 73,033 yuan, equivalent to 4.2% of the total wage income of the mine's employees during the same period.

	The workers of the first coal mining section of this mine, in the first five months of this year, because of the adoption of advanced coal mining methods, have greatly exceeded the state plan in terms of cycle times and output while ensuring safety and reducing material consumption. Consequently, the workers not only increased their income in terms of piece-rate wages but also received a considerable amount of bonuses. Old worker Wang Youlin, who was selected as an advanced producer this time, recently developed a cement electric drill for tunneling hard rock formations underground with the help of technicians. Using this electric drill to replace pneumatic drills for blasting holes can avoid rock dust, prevent workers from suffering from lung diseases, and save 90% of electricity, thus winning a bonus of 200 yuan.

    阜新平安矿拨款奖励先进职工
    新华社阜新11日电　阜新平安矿决定从企业基金里拿出六千一百九十七元，奖励新近评选出来的四百九十二名先进生产者和四十九个先进集体单位。今年上半年，这个矿发给职工的各种奖金总数已达七万三千零三十三元，相当全矿职工同期工资收入的4.2％。
    这个矿里的第一采煤段工人，在今年前五个月当中因为采用先进的采煤方法，在保证安全和降低材料消耗的情况下，循环次数、产量等都大大超过了国家计划，因而工人们不仅在计件工资方面增加了收入，而且还得到了一笔相当数量的奖金。这次被评选为先进生产者的老工人王有林，不久以前在技术人员帮助下研究出一种在井下掘进硬岩层用的水泥电钻，用这种电钻代替风钻打炮眼，可以避免岩尘，防止工人患肺病，并且能节省电力十分之九，因而获得奖金二百元。
