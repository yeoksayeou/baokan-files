　　At a little after three o'clock in the morning on July 3rd, a convoy of carts loaded with grain appeared on the road leading from the southern coast of the Bohai Sea to Chengguan in Huang County. These were farmers from Qu Tan Township in Huang County selling grain and delivering summer public grain.

　　This large township of about two thousand households had a bumper wheat harvest this year. The entire township had to sell more than 500,000 jin of summer grain to the state, and also deliver a little over 100,000 jin of public grain. After several days and nights of intensive work, all the agricultural cooperatives in the township had prepared more than 600,000 jin of grain. The grain for sale and the public grain were all the best wheat from the upland fields. In order to hand over good wheat to the state, each cooperative harvested, threshed, and dried the wheat separately. The wheat was winnowed three times, and sieved once before being bagged.

　　The night before the grain delivery, the Qianjin Agricultural Cooperative was in an uproar all night. The members were busy loading the grain onto the carts until midnight, and after only a short rest, they got up again to harness the animals and set off. The girls who accompanied the carts into the city were even more excited and couldn't sleep all night. Because they had already earned a lot of money based on their labor days after the preliminary distribution by the agricultural cooperative, they all had their own plans for this trip to the city. And the girls who weren't going to the city also asked them to buy things. For example, the health worker Zou Sufang, who was accompanying the carts, received many requests: buying undershirts, socks, combs, all kinds of colorful fabrics, and so on. The fabric coupons she received from others to buy fabric amounted to more than ten zhang, almost bewildering her. Youth League member Ma Xiangling had long wanted to have her picture taken in the city, so she dressed up carefully before setting off. Around three o'clock in the morning, everything was ready, and they were waiting to depart. But the sky was very gloomy, with dark clouds covering the sky and no stars visible. However, the convoy still set off. The members automatically ran home and took the sleeping mats from their kangs, covering each cart with two mats, so they wouldn't be afraid of the rain.

　　This year's grain selling and delivery was very different from previous years. Just look at the energy: all big carts, each filled with sacks, each sack weighing one hundred and fifty jin. All those accompanying the carts were young and strong, and each production team also sent two young women to take care of the carts, one was a bag-sewer - responsible for sewing up any leaks in the grain bags. The other was a health worker carrying a delicate little medicine box. They chatted and laughed all the way, it was quite lively.

　　As soon as it dawned, the carts flooded into the north gate of Huang County. Several main streets were completely filled. Many people who had just woken up ran out to watch: "So early! This year's public grain delivery is more than a month earlier than in previous years!" "Things have really changed a lot since cooperativization!"

　　It was almost noon when the grain was put into the warehouse. Some members of the grain delivery team were urging everyone to go back, but some members were missing. Where did all that energy come from for the young men and women? Without eating or resting, they had already slipped away in groups of three or five to the city's department stores, supply and marketing cooperative stores, clothing bureaus, and photo studios.

    送粮
    新华社记者　康宁
    七月三日早晨三点多钟，渤海南岸通往黄县城关的大路上出现了一支满载粮食的大车队。这是黄县曲谭乡农民在卖粮和交送夏季公粮了。
    这个两千户左右的大乡今年小麦丰收。全乡要卖五十多万斤夏粮给国家，另外要交十万斤多点公粮。经过几个昼夜的突击，全乡各农业社就把六十多万斤粮食准备好了。卖的粮和公粮都是上坡地里的顶好麦子。为了把好麦交给国家，各社都是单收、单打、单晒的。这些麦子都扬了三遍，装袋以前又过了一遍筛子。
    出发送粮的那个晚上，前进农业社直闹腾了一夜。社员们把粮食装上车直忙到半夜十二点，大家刚闭眼休息了一会，就又起来套牲口出发了。随车送粮进城的姑娘们更是一夜兴奋的睡不着。因为农业社预分后她们凭自己的劳动日已经分得了不少钱，这次进城都有自己的打算。而且不进城的姑娘还托她们买东西。比如随车进城的保健员邹素芳就接受了很多委托：买汗衫呀、袜子呀、梳子呀，各色各样的花布呀等等。她收到别人托她购布的布票就有十丈多，几乎都把她弄糊涂了。青年团员马香苓早就想进城照相，因此在出发以前着实地打扮了一番。约摸午夜三点钟的时候，一切都准备妥当，就等待出发了。可是天非常阴沉，满天乌云不见星。但是，车队还是出发了。社员们自动跑回家把炕上的睡席揭下来，每辆大车上都盖上了两张，下雨也不怕了。
    今年卖粮和送粮的情景，可跟往年大不一样。只看看那股劲儿吧：一色的大车，车车是麻袋，袋袋一百五十斤。跟车的全是青壮年，每个生产队还派了两个青年妇女照顾车，一个是缝袋员——粮袋有了破漏由她负责缝补。另一个是背着精致的小药箱的保健员。他们一路上有说有笑，好不热闹。
    天刚亮，大车涌进了黄县城北关。几条大街塞得满满的。许多刚醒来的人都跑出来看：“好早啊，今年送公粮比往年提前了足有一个多月！”“合作化以后真是大变了样儿了！”
    天快晌午了，粮食入仓了。送粮队有人催着回去，可是有些社员不见了。小伙子们和姑娘们不知从那里来的那么多劲儿？也没吃饭，也不休息，三个一簇、五个一群，早就溜到城里百货商店、供销社门市部、成衣局和照相馆去了。
