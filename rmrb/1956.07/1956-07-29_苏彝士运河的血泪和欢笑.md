The Blood, Tears, and Laughter of the Suez Canal
崔奇

Two Different Dinners

In 1875, a journalist from the London "Pall Mall Gazette," Greenwood, was having dinner with a financier. During their conversation, he happened to learn that the extravagant Egyptian King Ismail, heavily in debt, was preparing to mortgage his shares in the Suez Canal Company to a consortium. An hour later, Greenwood told this news to the British Prime Minister, Disraeli. The next day, Disraeli borrowed four million pounds from his Jewish merchant friends. On the fifth day, he had already bought the shares from the Egyptian King. Disraeli did not consult the cabinet or parliament but reported this deal directly to Queen Victoria. This British Prime Minister had done a quick and clever thing for the colonists, and he was almost intoxicated with admiration for his own talents.

But history is merciless. Eighty-one years later, another British Prime Minister encountered a different situation.

On the evening of July 26, 1956, Prime Minister Eden hosted a banquet for King Faisal of Iraq at 10 Downing Street in London. Just as they were raising their glasses in celebration, they received news that Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser had issued a decree nationalizing the Suez Canal Company. Now, Egyptian policemen wearing helmets had taken up positions around the Suez Canal Company building in Cairo, and Egyptian officials had sealed the company's doors with red sealing wax....

Prime Minister Eden was also quick and clever. He put down his glass, dismissed his distinguished guest, and immediately held an emergency meeting with the Foreign Secretary, the heads of the armed forces, and the diplomatic representatives of the United States and France.

However, today's Egypt is not Ismail's Egypt, and no one in the world can take the Suez Canal from the Egyptian people.

The Bones of 120,000 Egyptians

Suez, Suez, how much blood and tears have the Egyptian people shed for it!

From 1859 to 1869, these were ten years of suffering. Tens of thousands of Egyptian laborers, in the dry desert, under the scorching sun, used their hands to excavate the colossal Suez Canal. Disease, hard labor, and hunger claimed the lives of 120,000 Egyptians. The Suez Canal was not built with francs and pounds; it was built with the bones of 120,000 Egyptians. The Suez Canal flows not with the water of the Red Sea, but with the tears of millions of Egyptian mothers.

On November 17, 1869, the canal was completed. The vainglorious Egyptian King Khedive invited representatives from various countries to attend the opening ceremony. He specially built luxurious residences, hired five hundred chefs and one thousand servants, and prepared many yachts to entertain the distinguished guests. The Italian composer Verdi also wrote the opera "Aida" for the canal's opening, which premiered in Cairo.

However, this grand ceremony became a great mockery of the Egyptian people. The Suez Canal did not bring any benefits to the Egyptian people but instead brought national disaster. Western colonists, in order to compete for control of the canal, turned Egypt into a battlefield. Finally, Britain seized the Suez Canal and then turned Egypt into its colony.

The bones of the Egyptians piled up into pyramids, and the gold coins extracted by the colonists also piled up into pyramids. The cost of excavating the Suez Canal was 17 million pounds, of which Egypt bore 16 million pounds, but later most of the canal company's shares were seized by Britain and France. From 1870 to 1930, the canal company's profits reached 3.5 billion gold francs. Meanwhile, the Egyptian people on both sides of the canal became even more impoverished. During the years of British rule, how many hungry Egyptian farmers lived by eating grass roots and bark, and how many Egyptian residents died from disease!

The Suez Canal is a witness to all of this. Today, it will accuse the whole world!

Dozens of Promises of Withdrawal

In order to consolidate its colonial profits, Britain sent troops to bombard Alexandria in 1882 and occupied the Suez Canal area and Egypt. At that time, British Prime Minister Joseph Chamberlain described this occupation as "temporary," saying, "Once order is restored, we will withdraw." But how long was this "temporary" occupation? Ten years passed, sixty years passed, and the British army remained in Suez. Madame Adam, in her book "England in Egypt," said that from 1882 to 1922, Britain had made sixty-six promises regarding withdrawal.

The Egyptian people knew that begging the colonists would not bring freedom. They never stopped fighting. In the years 1906, 1919, 1924, 1930, 1936, and 1951, on the streets of Cairo, on the shores of Alexandria, on the banks of the Suez Canal, countless Egyptian patriots sacrificed their lives for the independence and freedom of their country.

Their blood was not shed in vain. Finally, on July 23, 1952, the Egyptian people drove away the reactionary King Farouk and ended the rule of the feudal monarchy. Finally, on June 13, 1956, the last British soldier was forced to withdraw from the Suez Canal area, and the last British flag was lowered forever on Egyptian soil.

"The Second Suez"

A new Egypt is moving forward.

The Egyptian people have won freedom and must also win happiness. They want to build the massive Aswan High Dam on the Nile River, they want to develop their own industry and agriculture, and they are building their independent country with the greatest enthusiasm. The Egyptian people have difficulties, but these are difficulties in progress, not the difficulties of Ismail. Western colonists, holding onto 1875 history textbooks, are dreaming again of seizing "the second Suez." The United States and Britain said to Egypt, "Let us help you build the great dam, but in exchange for your freedom, otherwise, we will refuse 'aid.'" In the eyes of the American masters, without dollars, how can the Egyptians live? But the Egyptian people answered the colonists simply: "We don't need dollars; we can still live, and we can still build the great dam."

July 26, 1956, will be inscribed in Egyptian history with indelible brilliance. President Nasser announced the nationalization of the Suez Canal Company, and at the same time declared: "We will build this (Aswan) great dam on the bones of the 120,000 Egyptian workers who died digging the Suez Canal." He told the Egyptian people with hearty laughter that the revenue from the Suez Canal would be more than enough to support the construction of the Aswan High Dam.

Yes, the Aswan High Dam will become "the second Suez," but the dreams of colonial aggressors will never come true. Suez and Aswan both belong to Egypt, and they will create happiness for the Egyptian people.

The Suez Canal, created by the blood and sweat of the Egyptian people, has finally returned to Egypt's embrace. The Suez Canal has forever ended its history of blood and tears; today, it laughs. Today, all of Asia, all of Africa, and the whole world seem to hear the joyous song of all Egypt. This song makes the colonists tremble. This song inspires those who love freedom. Let us congratulate the owner of the Suez Canal—the heroic and victorious Egyptian people! (Attached picture)

    苏彝士运河的血泪和欢笑
    崔奇
                     两次不同的晚餐
    1875年的一天，伦敦“保尔马尔公报”记者格林伍德同一位财政家共进晚餐。他在闲谈中偶然得到一个消息：挥金如土的埃及国王伊斯迈尔因为负债太多，准备把他握有的苏彝士运河公司股票向一个财团抵押。一小时以后，格林伍德把这个消息告诉了英国首相狄斯拉利。第二天，狄斯拉利就从他的朋友犹太商人那里借了四百万英镑。第五天，他已经把埃及国王手中的股票买过来了。狄斯拉利没有经过内阁和议会，直接把这件生意报告给维多利亚女王。这位英国首相替殖民者干了一件手灵脚快的事，他简直由于欣赏自己的才能而陶醉了。
    但，历史是无情的。过了八十一年，另一位英国首相却碰到了另一种景况。
    1956年7月26日晚上，艾登首相在伦敦唐宁街十号设宴招待伊拉克国王费萨尔。正当他们举杯相庆的时候，突然得到消息：埃及总统阿卜杜勒·纳赛尔已经发布一项法令，把苏彝士运河公司收归国有。现在，戴着钢盔的埃及警察已在开罗的苏彝士运河公司大楼周围布了岗警，埃及官员们用红色火漆封闭了这个公司的大门……。
    艾登首相也是手灵脚快的。他放下了酒杯，丢开了贵宾，立即同外交大臣、三军首脑和美、法的外交使节举行紧急会议。
    但是，今天的埃及已经不是伊斯迈尔的埃及，世界上再没有什么人能够把苏彝士运河从埃及人民手中夺去了。
    十二万埃及人的白骨
    苏彝士，苏彝士，埃及人民为它流了多少血泪！
    从1859年到1869年，这是苦难的十年。成万的埃及民工，在干枯的沙漠上，在烈日的曝晒下，用双手开凿了工程浩大的苏彝士运河。疾病、苦役和饥饿夺去了十二万埃及人的生命。苏彝士运河不是用法郎和英镑建成的，那是用十二万埃及人的白骨建成的。苏彝士运河里流的不是红海的水，那是千百万埃及母亲的眼泪。
    1869年11月17日，运河完工了。好大喜功的埃及国王凯第夫邀请各国代表参加开河典礼。他特地修建了豪华的官邸，雇佣了五百名厨师和一千名仆役，准备了许多游艇，以招待贵宾。意大利作曲家维尔迪还为运河通航写了歌剧“阿伊达”，也在开罗初次上演。
    可是，这个盛典却成了对埃及人民的莫大讽刺。苏彝士运河没有给埃及人民带来任何福利，而是带来了民族的灾难。西方殖民者为了争夺运河的控制权，把埃及当作了角斗场。最后，英国终于夺取了苏彝士运河，并进而把埃及变为它的殖民地。
    埃及人的白骨堆成了金字塔，殖民者榨取的金圆也堆成了金字塔。苏彝士运河的开凿费用为一千七百万英镑，埃及负担了一千六百万英镑，但后来运河公司股票大部都被英国和法国攫取去了。从1870年到1930年，运河公司所获利润竟达三十五亿金法郎。而运河两岸的埃及人民更加贫困如洗。在英国统治的年代里，多少饥饿的埃及农民吃草根树皮过活，多少埃及居民由于疾病而死亡！
    苏彝士运河就是这一切的见证者。今天，它要向全世界控诉！
      几十次撤军的诺言
    英国为了巩固它的殖民利润，1882年出兵炮轰亚历山大城，并占领了苏彝士运河区和埃及。当时英国首相约瑟夫·张伯伦把这种占领说成是“临时”的，他说：“一旦秩序恢复，我们就会撤退。”可是这个“临时”的占领是多么长久呢？十年过去了，六十年过去了，英军还留在苏彝士。法国亚当夫人在“英国在埃及”一书中说，从1882年到1922年英国关于撤军的诺言就说过六十六次。
    埃及人民知道，向殖民者乞求是不能得到自由的。他们从未停止过斗争。在1906，1919，1924，1930，1936，1951这些年代里，在开罗的街头，在亚历山大的海滨，在苏彝士运河的岸边，无数埃及的爱国者为祖国的独立自由抛弃了头颅。
    他们的血没有白流。终于，在1952年7月23日，埃及人民把反动的国王法鲁克赶走了，结束了封建王室的统治。终于，在1956年6月13日，最后一个英国兵被迫撤离了苏彝士运河区，最后一面英国旗在埃及国土上永远地降落了。
      “第二个苏彝士”
    一个新生的埃及在前进。
    埃及人民赢得了自由，还要赢得幸福。他们要在尼罗河上修建巨大的阿斯旺高水坝，他们要发展自己的工业和农业，他们正以最大的热情建设自己的独立国家。埃及人民是有困难的，但这是前进中的困难，不是伊斯迈尔的困难。西方殖民者抱着1875年的历史课本，竟又梦想夺取“第二个苏彝士”了。美国和英国向埃及说，我们来帮助你们修建大水坝吧，但是要用你们的自由来交换，否则就拒绝“援助”。在美国老爷们看来，没有美元，埃及人怎能过活？可是埃及人民干脆地回答了殖民者：我们不要美元，一样可以生活，而且一样可以修建大水坝。
    1956年7月26日这一天将带着不灭的光芒载入埃及史册。纳赛尔总统宣布把苏彝士运河公司收归国有，同时又宣布：“我们将要在死于开凿苏彝士运河的十二万埃及工人的尸骨上建造这个（阿斯旺）大水坝。”他带着爽朗的笑声告诉埃及人民，用苏彝士运河的收益来支持阿斯旺大水坝的工程还绰绰有余呢。
    是的，阿斯旺大水坝将成为“第二个苏彝士”，但是殖民侵略者的梦想却是永远不会实现的。苏彝士，阿斯旺，都是属于埃及的，它们将为埃及人民创造幸福。
    由埃及人民血汗创造的苏彝士运河终于回到埃及的怀抱了。苏彝士运河永远结束了它的血泪史，今天，它欢笑了。今天，全亚洲，全非洲，全世界都仿佛听到了埃及举国欢腾的歌声。这歌声使殖民者发抖。这歌声使爱好自由的人们为之振奋。让我们向苏彝士运河的主人——英勇的和胜利的埃及人民致贺！（附图片）
