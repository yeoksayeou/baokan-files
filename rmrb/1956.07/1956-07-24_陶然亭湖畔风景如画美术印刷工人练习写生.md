Xinhua News Agency Report: On the morning of the 20th, a group of people were sketching by Taoranting Lake in Beijing, some painting Taoranting Pavilion, others painting Yunhui Tower. These sketchers are all workers from the Beijing No. 4 Printing Factory, and they are all amateur art enthusiasts. This is them practicing painting during their days off.

The Beijing No. 4 Printing Factory specializes in printing New Year pictures, propaganda posters, and colorful art prints. Due to the nature of their work, the workers are very fond of painting. Recently, the factory held an art exhibition, displaying more than 50 pieces of Chinese paintings, watercolors, sketches, etc. Du Dian San, an older worker, painted meticulous depictions of "Insects and Grass" and "Peonies," which were quite vivid. He is now a member of the Beijing Chinese Painting Research Association. Cai Guangrong's several sketches of "Playing Chess" and "Children" are lifelike with just a few strokes.

By learning to paint, workers can better understand the author's intentions when printing art prints and produce better prints. The factory is currently preparing to establish an amateur art research group to more broadly develop workers' amateur art creation activities.

    陶然亭湖畔风景如画美术印刷工人练习写生
    据新华社讯　二十日一清早，北京陶然亭湖畔，有一群人在写生，有的画陶然亭，有的画云绘楼。这些写生者都是北京市印刷四厂的工人，他们都是业余美术爱好者，这是他们乘例假在练习绘画。
    北京市印刷四厂专门印刷一些年画、宣传画、彩色美术画片等。因为职业的关系，工人们都很喜欢绘画。最近工厂举办了一个美术展览会，展出国画、水彩画、速写等五十多幅。老工人杜殿三画的工笔
  “草虫”、“牡丹”，颇为传神。他现在是北京市中国画研究会的会员。蔡广荣画的几幅速写“下棋”、“小孩”，寥寥几笔，维妙维肖。
    工人学会了绘画，在印刷一些美术画片时可以领会作者的意图，印得更好。工厂里现正准备成立业余美术研究小组，更广泛地开展工人业余美术创作活动。
