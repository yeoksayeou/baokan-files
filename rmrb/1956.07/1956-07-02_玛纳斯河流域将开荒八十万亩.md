Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi, 1st -- The Production and Construction Corps of the Xinjiang Military Region of the People's Liberation Army is reclaiming wasteland and carrying out water conservancy construction in the Manas River Basin. At present, smoke from burning wasteland fills the air, and tractors run non-stop.

In the Anjihai, Deshengdi, and other areas of the Manas River Basin, the production corps is building six mechanized farms, including Anjihai. These farms will reclaim approximately 800,000 mu of land. Among them, the Anjihai Farm, which mainly grows cotton, will have more than 300,000 mu of cultivated land. Most of these farms will be basically completed this year.

At the same time, the production corps is expanding and renovating the farms previously built in Shihezi, Wula Usu, Pao Tai, and Chepaizi and other places.

On the banks of the Bayingou River and the Sikeshu River in this basin, the production corps is building permanent large-scale canals such as the Bayingou Diversion Canal. In addition, two reservoirs, Liugou and Anjihai, are being constructed.

    玛纳斯河流域将开荒八十万亩
    据新华社乌鲁木齐1日电　人民解放军新疆军区生产建设部队，正在玛纳斯河流域的荒原上开荒和进行水利建设。现在，这片荒原上，整日烧荒的烟雾到处弥漫，拖拉机不停地奔跑。
    在玛纳斯河流域的安集海、德胜地等地区，生产部队正在建设着安集海等六个机械化农场。这些农场将要开垦出约八十万亩土地。其中种植棉花为主的安集海农场，将拥有三十多万亩耕地。这些农场大部分在今年基本建成。
    生产部队同时对过去在石河子、乌拉乌苏、炮台和车排子等地建设的农场，实行扩建和改建。
    在这个流域的八音沟河和四棵树河畔，生产部队正在修建永久性的八音沟引水渠等大型渠道。此外还修建柳沟和安集海两个水库。
