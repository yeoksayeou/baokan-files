Newspaper Commentary Summary

Strengthening the Training of Enterprise Cadres

A July 2nd editorial in the Heilongjiang Daily pointed out: Many industrial and mining enterprises in Heilongjiang Province are tasked with transferring cadres in batches, while the enterprises themselves have not yet filled the large number of vacancies for cadres at all levels and of all types. The majority of cadres transferred from local areas to industry lack modern scientific and technical knowledge, and a significant portion of the original enterprise cadres also need to rapidly improve their business management and technical skills. Therefore, it is necessary to actively and effectively strengthen the training of enterprise cadres.

However, the current cadre training work is not being done well. Although some factories and mines have formulated plans for training cadres, they have relaxed the specific organizational work. In this way, even the best plans will become empty words. Some units have carried out some training work, but it is intermittent, or even abandoned halfway.

The editorial pointed out that the enterprise Party organizations should take advantage of the current favorable opportunity of workers marching towards science, culture, and technology, and formulating their own advancement plans to strengthen the leadership over cadre training work. As for the methods of training cadres, they are diverse. One is to train cadres through practical work, that is, to run short-term training courses of various types in conjunction with central work, as well as to conduct regular business learning. Another is to establish learning contracts, implement layer-by-layer responsibility and division of labor, and the reserve cadre system. But no matter what training method is adopted, it is necessary to combine focusing on training technical management cadres that are scarce in the factory and urgently needed by the factory and new factories with leading workers to conduct universal business learning and training workers.

    地方报纸评论摘要
    加强企业干部的培养训练工作
    七月二日黑龙江日报的一篇社论指出：黑龙江省的不少工矿企业都担负着成批输送干部的任务，而企业本身各级各类干部的大量缺额尚未补齐，大部分从地方转入工业的干部非常缺乏现代科学技术知识，相当一部分原有的企业干部的企业管理和技术水平也要求迅速提高。因此，就需要积极有效地加强企业干部的培养训练工作。
    但是，目前干部的培养工作还作得不好。有些厂矿虽然制定了培养训练干部的规划，但却放松了具体的组织工作，这样，再好的规划也会变成一纸空文。有些单位虽则进行了一些培养工作，但又是时断时续，甚至是半途而废。
    社论指出，企业党组织应当利用当前职工向科学文化技术进军、制订自己进步规划的有利时机，加强对培养干部工作的领导。至于培养训练干部的方法，则是多种多样的。一种是通过实际工作培养和训练干部，即结合中心工作开办各种性质的专业短期训练班，以及进行经常性的业务学习。另一种是建立学习合同、层层负责分工包干和后备干部制度等。但无论采用什么训练方式，都要把着重培养本厂奇缺及本厂和新厂迫切需要的技术管理方面的干部，和领导职工进行普遍的业务学习及培养工人的工作结合起来。
