    Pankratova on the Tenth International Congress of Historians

    The Soviet journal "Problems of History" published an article by A.M. Pankratova in its fifth issue this year: "On the Achievements of the Tenth International Congress of Historians." The author detailed the academic reports and panel discussions at the conference. Pankratova also gave a principled introduction to the debates that occurred between Marxist historians and bourgeois historians due to their different positions.

    Pankratova said that the Tenth International Congress of Historians was fruitful and of great significance. At the Tenth International Congress of Historians, historians from various countries became familiar with each other's achievements in the study of important issues in the history of historiography. Before the conference, many pessimists doubted whether a scientific connection could be established between Marxist historians and bourgeois historians. At the same time, it should be admitted that both sides had a poor understanding of each other's research achievements. This conference showed that cooperation between Marxist historians and bourgeois historians in consolidating peace and developing science is not only possible but also necessary. Of course, their academic viewpoints, positions, and methods are completely different, but they have a common foundation for scientific cooperation. This is historical fact. Marxist historians use the theory of historical materialism to explain historical facts, while bourgeois historians proceed from an idealist conception of history.

    The conference not only explored narrow and localized issues, but also explored general issues of great historiographical and methodological significance. There were many reports at the conference, with a wide and diverse range of topics. Some reports and articles have made significant contributions to science due to their thorough research and analysis of historical facts. The article also mentioned that bourgeois scholars, in comprehensively analyzing facts and trying to reveal the interrelationships and dynamics of facts, are increasingly explaining socio-economic conditions and analyzing the class composition of society and the struggles between classes. It is worth noting that interest in the study of peasant history, working-class history, and people's movement history is growing.

    Pankratova said that the historians of the Soviet Union, the people's democratic countries, and the progressive historians of capitalist countries played a significant role in familiarizing the participants with the state of Marxist historiography. She also said that the growing influence of historical materialism on the historiography of capitalist countries is one of the most important phenomena in modern historiography.

    潘克拉托娃谈第十届国际史学家会议
    今年第五期苏联“历史问题”杂志发表了阿·马·潘克拉托娃的文章：“谈第十届国际史学家会议的成果”。作者详细介绍了这次会议上的学术报告和分组讨论的情况。对于马克思主义史学家和资产阶级史学家因立场不同而发生的争论，潘克拉托娃也作了原则性的介绍。
    潘克拉托娃说，第十届国际史学家会议是有成果的，它的意义是重大的。在第十届国际史学家会议上，各国史学家们彼此熟悉了在研究史学史上重要问题的成果。在这次会议召开以前，不少悲观者曾怀疑马克思主义史学家和资产阶级史学家之间能否建立科学的联系。同时，也应该承认双方对于彼此研究的成就了解得很差。经过这次会议可以看出，马克思主义史学家和资产阶级史学家在巩固和平和发展科学方面的合作，不仅可能而且是必要的。当然，他们作学问的观点、立场、方法是完全不同的，但是他们在科学合作上却有一个共同的基础。这就是历史事实。马克思主义史学家是用历史唯物主义理论来说明历史事实，而资产阶级史学家则是从唯心史观出发的。
    这次会议不仅探讨了狭隘的局部问题，而且也探讨了重大的、带有历史编纂学和方法论性质的一般问题。这次会上的报告很多，主题范围广泛而且多样化。有些报告和报道由于对历史事实经过周密研究和分析，对科学有重大的贡献。这篇文章还提到，资产阶级学者们在全面分析事实、极力想揭示事实的相互联系和动力时，越来越多地说明社会经济情况，分析社会的阶级构成和各阶级之间的斗争。值得注意的是研究农民史、工人阶级史和人民运动史的兴趣在增长。
    潘克拉托娃说，苏联、人民民主国家的史学家和资本主义国家进步史学家，在使与会者熟悉马克思主义史学状况方面起了显著的作用。而且她说，历史唯物主义对资本主义国家史学家的影响在增大，是现代历史编纂学中的一个最重要的现象。
