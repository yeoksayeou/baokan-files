    Visiting Anshan Iron and Steel's Second Steel Plant
    Xinhua News Agency Reporter Zhou Qun
    Stepping into the spacious factory building of Anshan Iron and Steel's Second Steel Plant, which is still undergoing reconstruction, what unfolds before your eyes is a row of newly built, gigantic, automated open-hearth furnaces. The molten gold-white steel water tumbling in the smelting chamber emits dazzling brilliance. The fiery flames of gas rushing into the open-hearth furnace along thick passages constantly burst out of the furnace door seams in clusters of leaping flames. The loader's thick, long iron arm continuously lifts batches of raw materials into the open-hearth furnace, braving the scorching flames. Steelworkers and technicians, wearing dark blue glasses, carry out their work in an orderly manner.
    At the construction site of the last few open-hearth furnaces still under construction, the piles of new refractory bricks almost completely occupy the western half of the site. A large number of new bricks are still automatically coming in an endless stream along a conveyor belt that stretches as far as the eye can see.
    Being in this magnificent and splendid scene is truly exciting. But when the people in the factory tell me about the future production scale of this steel plant, it is even more inspiring.
    This steel plant, which was severely damaged and shut down for many years before liberation, has successfully built and put into production seven large open-hearth furnaces in just one and a half years since construction started in November 1954. The last few open-hearth furnaces that have not yet been built can also be successfully built within this year.
    This steel plant was originally built according to the model of Anshan Iron and Steel's First Steel Plant during the period of Japanese and puppet rule, and its design and equipment were very backward. However, in the reconstruction, due to the absorption of many of the latest technological achievements in steelmaking in the world, its backward situation has been fundamentally changed. An old worker pointed to four open-hearth furnaces in a row and told the reporter that during the Japanese and puppet period, they were all specially used as preparatory refining furnaces to remove the large amount of silicon (similar to brick and stone) contained in pig iron. Since Anshan Iron and Steel successfully smelted low-silicon iron, pig iron can be directly put into open-hearth furnaces for steelmaking. This reduces a complicated steelmaking production process and can increase the country's steel production by hundreds of thousands of tons every year.
    Here, the heavy physical labor in various production processes in steelmaking operations, from loading and unloading raw materials, opening and closing furnace doors, repairing furnaces to refining furnaces, has been replaced by mechanized and automated new equipment. In the instrument room opposite each open-hearth furnace, a set of the latest automatic control devices has been installed. Through the clear glass window, you can see the red and green lights of the instrument signal lights. The steelworkers proudly told me that these instruments, like scouts, can not only accurately and timely indicate and record the temperature inside the open-hearth furnace, but also automatically adjust the furnace temperature to normal when the furnace temperature is too high or too low. In the old steel plant, the furnace temperature was mainly observed with the naked eye and adjusted manually, which often resulted in burning the furnace due to excessively high temperature, or prolonging the tapping time due to excessively low temperature.
    The tapping time for an open-hearth furnace has arrived. The steelworkers deftly opened the tapping trough. The dazzling steel water, rising with ten thousand fine sparks, rolled down the steel water channel and poured into the steel ladle, looking like a golden-white waterfall from afar. Soon after the steel was tapped, steel ingots were poured. Several majestic giant bridge cranes each hoisted a steel ladle filled with nearly a hundred tons of molten steel, and steadily drove over the ingot casting car loaded with ingot molds. After the stopper rod at the bottom of the steel ladle was opened, the red-hot steel water continuously flowed into the ingot molds, filling one mold after another. The ingot casting workers told reporters: after the steel water solidified in the mold, the ingot casting car drove along the railway into the demolding workshop, where the huge demolding machine took off the molds and placed them on another ingot casting car, which was sent to the cold mold, mold repairing, and oil coating workshops in order, and then sent back to the ingot casting workshop for ingot casting; and the cast steel ingots were still emitting high heat and were transported to the blooming mill to roll steel billets needed for various steel products. The working conditions for the entire ingot casting operation are perfect. The wide factory building of the ingot casting workshop is clean and tidy, fresh and cool air flows smoothly, and all kinds of heavy physical labor have been completely mechanized.
    Due to the advanced design and superior equipment of the rebuilt Anshan Iron and Steel's Second Steel Plant, its annual steelmaking time can be increased by about 15% compared with the old steel plant, and each open-hearth furnace can produce more than one hundred more heats of steel per year than each open-hearth furnace in the old steel plant. The number of workers mastering open-hearth furnaces has also been greatly reduced, and the average production value of each worker in the plant per year can exceed more than twice that of the old steel plant.
    The steel plant after its completion will become one of the important pillars for China to realize socialist industrialization. However, it is not easy to build such a giant factory. It took more than a year just to collect the factory construction data. The installation of a large number of mechanical equipment and lifting equipment in the whole plant has very strict technical requirements. There are more than 100 kinds of refractory bricks needed for factory construction, which can fill thousands of railway cars. The steelmaking open-hearth furnace, weighing more than 1,000 tons, must be firmly installed on a set of rotating devices. If one of the dozens of roller conveyors in this device has a problem, the entire furnace cannot tap steel. Although the factory construction work is very arduous, the steel capital builders with high construction enthusiasm and infinite wisdom will soon complete the construction task of this huge steel plant.

    访问鞍钢第二炼钢厂
    新华社记者　周群
    踏进还在继续进行改建的鞍钢第二炼钢厂的宽阔的厂房，展现在眼前的是一排新建成的巨型的自动化新式平炉。熔炼室里翻腾着的金白色钢水，发出夺目的光采。沿着粗大孔道冲入平炉里的煤气烈火，不时地从炉门缝中钻出丛丛跳跃的火焰。装料机的粗长铁臂，冒着炽烈火焰不断地把一批批原料擎进平炉里去。炼钢工人和技术人员们，戴着深蓝色的眼镜，井然有序地进行着工作。
    正在建设中的最后几座平炉的施工现场上，堆积的新的耐火砖，几乎快要把现场的西半边占满了。而大量的新砖还在沿着一条一眼望不到头的皮带运输线，自动地鱼贯而来。
    置身在这幅宏伟壮丽的图景中，真叫人兴奋。可是当厂里人告诉我这座钢铁厂不久将来的生产规模的时候，更叫人振奋。
    这座在解放前受到严重破坏而停产多年的炼钢厂，从1954年11月动工改建以来，仅仅经过一年半的时间，就有七座大型平炉建设成功投入了生产。还未建设好的最后几座平炉，也可以在今年内建设成功。
    这座炼钢厂原是在日伪统治时期按照鞍钢第一炼钢厂的样子建设起来的，设计和设备都很落后。可是在改建中由于吸收了世界炼钢方面的许多最新的技术成就，现在它的落后状况已经根本改变了。一个老工人指点着一排平炉中的四座平炉对记者说，日伪时期它们都是专门用作炼除生铁内含的大量矽（类似砖石）的预备精炼炉，由于鞍钢冶炼低矽铁成功，生铁可以直接投入平炉炼钢，现在它们都被改建成了大型炼钢平炉。这样就减少了一道繁复的炼钢生产程序，并且每年可以给国家增产几十万吨的钢。
    这里，炼钢操作方面从装卸原料、开关炉门、补炉直到炼炉等各种生产程序中的繁重体力劳动，都由机械化自动化的新式设备代替了。在每座平炉对面的计器室里，安装上了一套最新式的自动控制装置。透过明净的玻璃窗，可以看见计器信号灯的红绿光亮。炼钢工人得意地告诉我，这些像侦察兵一样的计器，不但能把平炉内的温度准确而及时地指示和记录下来，而且当炉温过高或过低的时候，还能自动地把炉温调整得正常。而在旧炼钢厂，炉温主要是靠肉眼观察和用人力进行调整，往往因为炉温过高烧坏炉子，或是炉温过低延长出钢时间。
    一座平炉的出钢时间到了。炼钢工人敏捷地打开了出钢槽。光采夺目的钢水腾扬着万点纤细的星花，顺着钢水沟滚滚地向钢罐倾泻，远远望去，像一注金白色的瀑布一样。出完钢不久，就浇注钢锭。威风凛凛的几架巨型桥式吊车各自吊运着一个盛满近百吨重钢水的钢罐，稳重地驶向载着钢锭模的铸锭车上空。钢罐底部的塞棒被打开以后，通红的钢水就不断地流入钢锭模里，流满了一个模子又一个模子。铸锭工人告诉记者：钢水在模子里凝固以后，铸锭车就沿着铁路驶进脱模车间，由巨大的脱模机把模子脱下来放到另一辆铸锭车上，按次序送到冷模、整模、涂油等车间进行处理，然后再送回铸锭车间铸锭；而铸成的钢锭还在散发着高热，就被运往初轧厂轧制生产各种钢材需要的钢坯去了。整个铸锭工作的劳动条件都是完善的。铸锭车间的宽大厂房，干净利落，清凉的新鲜空气畅通，各种笨重的体力劳动已经全部机械化。
    改建后的鞍钢第二炼钢厂由于设计先进、设备优越，它每年的炼钢时间可以比旧炼钢厂增加15％左右，每座平炉每年可以比旧炼钢厂的每座平炉多炼出一百多炉的钢。掌握平炉的工人也减少了很多，全厂每个工人一年的生产价值平均可以超过旧炼钢厂两倍以上。
    建成后的这座炼钢厂将成为中国实现社会主义工业化的重要支柱之一。但是建设这样一座巨型工厂却是不容易的。仅是收集建厂资料，就花了一年多的时间。全厂大量机械设备和起重设备的安装，技术要求非常严格。建厂需要的耐火砖有一百多种，可以装上千个火车皮。重达一千多吨的炼钢平炉要牢实地安装在一套转动装置上，这套装置中的几十根辊道有一根出了毛病，整个炉子就不能出钢。建厂工作虽然十分艰巨，但是有着高度建设热情和无穷智慧的钢都建设者们，不久就要全部完成这一巨大的炼钢厂建设任务了。
