Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, July 13th: In the first half of this year, the Guangdong Provincial Overseas Chinese Affairs Committee properly arranged work for 129 senior intellectuals among returned overseas Chinese and relatives of overseas Chinese.

　　These senior intellectuals include professionals in radio, architecture, medicine, and art. Most of them have been assigned to work in science, technology, industry, mining, culture, and education departments. Among them, in addition to those originally in the country, some were invited back from overseas. When arranging their work, the main consideration was their personal aspirations and expertise, while also considering the needs of the country, so that they can give full play to their strengths in their work positions. Kwong Wai-yan, an overseas Chinese from the United States, was hired by the Guangzhou Design Institute of the Ministry of Petroleum Industry one week after returning from overseas. Before officially starting work, the design institute allowed him to visit various petroleum construction sites and relevant institutions to help him understand the petroleum industry situation in the motherland. He said with emotion: In the United States, many professionals like me cannot find work. The motherland is so concerned about me. I am so happy. I must wholeheartedly serve the motherland.

    广东归侨和侨眷中的高级知识分子
    129人受到妥善安排参加祖国建设
    新华社广州13日电　广东省华侨事务委员会在今年上半年妥善地安排了归国华侨和侨眷中的129名高级知识分子的工作。
    这些高级知识分子中，有无线电、建筑、医学、艺术各方面的专业人材，他们大部分都被分配到科学、技术、工矿、文教部门工作。他们当中除原来在国内的以外，还有一部分是从海外被邀请回来的。在安排他们工作的时候，主要根据本人的志愿和特长，同时也考虑到国家的需要，使他们在工作岗位上能发挥所长。在美国的华侨邝维彦从海外回来一星期以后，便由石油工业部广州设计院聘请工作，在未正式开始工作以前，设计院曾让他到各地石油工地和有关机构去参观，帮助他了解祖国的石油工业情况。他感动地说：在美国，像我这样的专业人材，许多人都找不到工作。祖国对我这样关切，我真是太幸福了。我一定要全心全意为祖国服务。
