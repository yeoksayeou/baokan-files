    According to Farmers' Grain Consumption Habits
    Hubei Uses Rice to Exchange for Wheat
    (Our dispatch) Hubei Province's grain departments, based on the historical habit of farmers in most wheat-producing areas selling wheat and buying rice, have decided to use over 290 million jin of rice to exchange for farmers' wheat and miscellaneous grains after this year's wheat harvest, in order to support agricultural production and satisfy farmers' needs for adjustments in grain varieties. Farmers in wheat-producing areas expressed warm welcome after learning about this measure by the state. Many farmers have saved time grinding wheat by exchanging for rice, and have rearranged their labor and revised their production plans. For example, in Xiaogang Township, Xiaogan County, the entire township can save 34,650 workdays as a result, and these labor resources can be used to transplant rice seedlings on 6,930 mu of land.
    Currently, grain departments across the province are actively organizing processing capacity to process rice, and are exchanging it in batches based on the principle of voluntary participation by farmers, with agricultural cooperatives as units. The conversion rate for exchange varieties is one jin and two to four liang of wheat for one jin of rice, with purchase and sales differences priced separately. According to incomplete statistics from the five special zones of Huanggang, Xiaogan, Xiangyang, Yichang, and Enshi, 23.28 million jin have already been exchanged for rice; in order to take care of farmers' grain needs before the summer harvest, the Huanggang and Xiaogan special zones alone have prepaid 24.97 million jin of rice to farmers, and this batch of prepaid rice will be returned by the agricultural cooperatives when the wheat harvest is pre-distributed.
    Currently, the summer grain has been massively brought to market, and the exchange of rice is being widely carried out throughout the province, with plans to complete the exchange before the autumn harvest. (Yan Liexiong)

    根据农民用粮习惯
    湖北用大米兑换小麦
    本报讯　湖北省粮食部门根据大部分产麦地区农民在历史上卖麦买米吃的习惯，决定在今年麦收后用二亿九千多万斤大米来兑换农民的小麦、杂粮，以支援农业生产和满足农民在粮食品种上的调剂。产麦地区农民知道国家这项措施后，表示热烈欢迎。许多农民因兑换大米节省了磨麦时间，重新安排劳动和修订生产计划。例如，孝感县肖港乡全乡可因此节省34，650个劳动日，用这些劳动力可插秧田6，930亩。
    现在全省各地粮食部门正积极组织加工力量加工大米，以农业社为单位按照农民自愿原则分批兑换。兑换品种的折合率是小麦一斤二两至四两换大米一斤，按购销差各作各价。根据黄冈、孝感、襄阳、宜昌、恩施等五个专区不完全的统计，已经用大米兑换的有2，328万斤；为照顾农民在夏收前的需粮要求，仅黄冈、孝感两个专区已预先付给农民大米2，497万斤，这批预付的大米等麦收预分时由农业社负责送还。
    目前夏粮已大量登场，兑换大米工作正在全省各地广泛开展，计划在秋收前可兑完。（鄢烈雄）
