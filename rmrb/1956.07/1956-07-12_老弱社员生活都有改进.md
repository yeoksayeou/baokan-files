Xinhua News Agency: In the summer harvest distribution of the Shetang Advanced Agricultural Producers' Cooperative in Lanxi County, Zhejiang Province, the twenty-three households of elderly, weak, sick, and disabled commune members whose incomes had decreased all received subsidies from the cooperative's public welfare fund. Their incomes increased compared to last year, and their lives have improved.

	Commune member Hu Rutang, who has a foot ailment, can only do light work in the cooperative, and the other three members of his family are also elderly and weak. Therefore, his summer income this year decreased by nearly 13% compared to last year. After the cooperative subsidized his family, his income increased compared to last year, and he no longer feels life is difficult. Hu Aixiang, a blind female commune member who received subsidized grain from the cooperative, used to eat carrots and tofu dregs during this time of year, but now she eats rice exchanged for wheat from the subsidized grain.

	The relationship between these commune member families and the agricultural cooperative has also become closer. Some commune members who are able to work have been giving full play to their labor enthusiasm. Some have participated in the work of raising oxen, and others have appeared on the construction site of the cooperative's reservoir, doing what they can.

    老弱社员生活都有改进
    据新华社讯　浙江省兰溪县社塘高级农业生产合作社在夏收分配中，二十三户减少收入的老弱疾残社员都获得社里的公益金补助，收入比去年增加，生活也过得好些了。
    脚上有病的社员胡如棠，在社里只能干些轻活，家中其他三个人又都是老弱，因此，今年夏季收入比去年减少了将近13％，社里补助了他家以后，收入就比去年增加，生活已经不感到困难了。获得社里补助粮的胡爱香，是一个眼睛失明的女社员，往年这时候要吃红萝卜和豆腐渣度日，而现在吃的是用补助粮小麦换来的大米。
    这些社员家庭和农业社的关系也更加密切了。有些能劳动的社员都发挥了劳动积极性。有的参加了饲养耕牛的工作，还有的出现在社里兴建的水库的工地上干自己可以干的活。
