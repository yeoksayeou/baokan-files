    Changsha Celebrates He Bingling's Fifty Years of Educational Work
    (Our Newspaper) News: The educational circles of Changsha, Hunan, gathered on the 10th to celebrate He Bingling, the principal of Hengshan County No. 1 Middle School, for his fifty years of educational work. At the meeting, the Hunan Provincial People's Committee awarded He Bingling a certificate of merit, and the Hunan Provincial Department of Education and the Education Trade Union also presented him with a Xiang embroidery centerpiece of pine and cranes symbolizing longevity. The white-haired old principal gave an emotional speech at the meeting, expressing his determination to work with young people to improve education in his remaining years, in order to repay the Party and the government for their emphasis on education and their care and concern for him personally.
    Old Principal He Bingling is already eighty years old this year. He studied in Japan in his early years, and after returning to China at the end of the Guangxu period of the Qing Dynasty, he engaged in education. He founded schools such as Hunan Yueyun Middle School (now renamed Hengshan No. 1 Middle School), Yueyun Physical Education College, Yueyun Advanced Agricultural College, and Yueyun Advanced Commercial College. Over the past fifty years, the students he has cultivated have spread all over the country. Military strategist Deng Hua, musician He Luting, and others are all his students. (Qin Yan)

    长沙庆祝何炳龄从事教育工作五十年
    本报讯　湖南长沙教育界于十日集会，庆祝衡山县第一中学校长何炳龄从事教育工作五十年。会上，湖南省人民委员会发给何炳龄一张奖状，湖南省教育厅和教育工会也赠送给他一幅松鹤遐龄的湘绣中堂。须发苍白的老校长在会上激动地讲了话，他表示要以有限的余年，和年青人一道搞好教育工作，以报答党和政府对教育工作的重视和对他个人的照顾和关怀。
    何炳龄老校长今年已经八十岁。他早年曾留学日本，前清光绪末年回国后，即从事教育事业。他曾创办过湖南岳云中学（现改为衡山一中）、岳云体育专科、岳云高农专科、岳云高商专科等学校。五十年来，他培养出来的学生已经是桃李满天下。军事家邓华、音乐家贺绿汀等人，都是他的学生。（覃言）
