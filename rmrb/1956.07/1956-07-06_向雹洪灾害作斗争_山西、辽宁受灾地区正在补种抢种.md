Fighting Against Hail and Flood Disasters

	Shanxi, Liaoning Disaster Areas are Replanting and Rush-Planting

	(Our newspaper reports) Since June, some areas in the Yuci, Changzhi, and Jinan regions of Shanxi Province have experienced continuous rain and frequent hailstorms, resulting in varying degrees of hail and flood disasters. After suffering from these disasters, agricultural cooperatives in these areas vigorously organized their members to carry out rescue work. As of now, over 500,000 mu of land have been replanted with different crops, over 900,000 mu have been replanted with seedlings, and over 500,000 mu have been saved through weeding, loosening the soil, and applying topdressing fertilizer. Taking the Donglou Agricultural Cooperative in Xin County as an example: after its 2,559 mu of autumn fields were hit by the hail and flood disasters, the cooperative quickly organized 578 male and female laborers to dig fourteen drainage ditches, draining the accumulated water from the fields, and replanting 1,210 mu. The remaining 1,439 mu of autumn crops have grown rapidly after applying over 4,700 jin of topdressing fertilizer and weeding and loosening the soil.

	During the rescue efforts, the agricultural cooperatives in various places received substantial material, financial, and human support from the state. In addition to sending responsible cadres to lead work teams deep into the disaster areas for condolences and assistance, the Party and government leading organs in Yuci, Changzhi, and Jinan regions allocated over 800,000 yuan in relief funds and loans, and over 1.1 million jin of relief grain and various seeds. The care of the Party and the government greatly encouraged the confidence of the cooperative members in overcoming the disasters. For example, 32 disaster-stricken cooperatives in Lin County received support from 20 non-disaster-stricken cooperatives, including the Wangjiahui cooperative, which organized over 200 laborers, 67 head of livestock, and 38,000 jin of seeds for replanting. The cooperative members in the disaster-stricken areas said with emotion: "With the support of the state and agricultural cooperatives in various places, there are no disasters that cannot be overcome!"

	(Our newspaper reports) Twenty counties and cities in Liaoning Province, including Faku, Tieling, Suizhong, and Chaoyang, were recently hit by sudden wind, rain, and hailstorms, causing varying degrees of damage to crops, livestock, housing. According to incomplete statistics: in Faku, Tieling, Liaozhong, Xinmin, and Shenyang, 2,164 houses were blown down by the storm, 140 qing of crops were damaged, and there were also casualties among people and livestock. Ninety townships in 16 counties and cities, including Kalaqin Left Banner, Changtu, and Kuandian, were affected by hailstorms, with a disaster area of 22,370 qing. In some places, torrential rains also formed mountain torrents, destroying houses and washing away grain, livestock, and trees.

	The leading organs in the affected areas are taking emergency measures. Liaozhong, Chaoyang, and other counties immediately organized a group of cadres to go to the disaster areas to resettle the victims, and mobilized farmers to support seedlings and save seedlings. Changtu County mobilized more than 2,000 migrant workers to rush to repair river embankments, and allocated 380,000 jin of buckwheat, mung beans, and other late-season seeds to the farmers for rush planting.

    向雹洪灾害作斗争
    山西、辽宁受灾地区正在补种抢种
    本报讯　山西省榆次、长治、晋南专区的一些县的部分地区，从六月份以来，阴雨连绵，并不断降落冰雹，发生了一些轻重不同的雹洪灾害。这些地区的农业社在遭受雹洪灾害后，大力组织社员抢救。截至目前为止，已改种作物50多万亩，补种移苗90余万亩，另有50万余亩经锄苗松土和施追肥后已抢救过来。以忻县东楼农业社为例：该社的2，559亩秋田，在遭受雹洪灾害后，迅速组织了578个男女劳力，挖了十四条排水沟，把田内积水排出，并改种补种1，210亩。其余1，439亩秋季作物，经过施追肥4，700多斤和锄苗松土后，已迅速成长起来。
    在抢救中，各地农业社得到了国家的大批物力、财力和人力的支援。各地党政领导机关除抽派负责干部率领工作组深入灾区进行慰问和帮助以外，榆次、长治、晋南专区还拨出救济款、贷款80多万元，救济粮和各种籽种110多万斤。党和政府的关怀，大大鼓舞了社员群众战胜灾害的信心。临县32个受灾社在改种补种中，还得到非灾区王家会等二十个社组织的200多个劳力、67头牲口和38，000斤种籽的支援。受灾社的社员们感动地说：“有国家和各地农业社的支援，没有战不胜的灾害！”

    各受灾地区的领导机关正采取紧急措施。辽中、朝阳等县都立即组织一批干部分赴灾区安置灾民，并发动农民扶苗、救苗，昌图县动员了二千多名民工赶修河堤，拨出三十八万斤荞麦、绿豆等晚田种子发给农民抢种。
