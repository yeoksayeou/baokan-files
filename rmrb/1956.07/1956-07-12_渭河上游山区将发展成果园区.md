The survey team is continuing its survey.

This spring, the China Northern Fruit Tree Inspection Group came here for inspection and believed that this area is suitable for large-scale fruit tree development.

    渭河上游山区将发展成果园区
    据新华社讯　西北农业科学研究所等机关组成的宜园地勘查组，已经在渭河上游山区勘查出适于种植果树的山地四十四万多亩。现在勘查组还在继续勘查。
    今年春天，中国北方果树考察团曾到这里考察，认为这里适宜于大量发展果树。春天，这里的农业生产合作社已经在六万多亩山地果园里栽种了良种苹果。
