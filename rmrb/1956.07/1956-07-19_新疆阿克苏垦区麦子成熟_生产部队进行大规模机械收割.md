	Wheat Ripens in Aksu Reclamation Area, Xinjiang
	Production Troops Conduct Large-Scale Mechanical Harvesting

	(Our report) The more than 80,000 mu of winter and spring wheat of the Aksu Reclamation Area troops of the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps have successively ripened and summer harvesting has been successfully carried out. This year's harvesting task is mainly undertaken by combine harvesters, tractor-drawn harvesters, and horse-drawn harvesters. Many new production experts have emerged in the harvesting process.

	Shengli Farm, which participated in the national inter-farm competition for state-owned farms, dispatched six combine harvesters, eight tractors, thirty-two horse-drawn harvesters, and eight mowers. In the boundless golden wheat fields, the machines roared day and night, and the dense crowds that used to harvest manually were no longer seen.

	During the harvest, the combine harvester team led by Sun Shaohua of Shengli Farm created a high-yield record of harvesting 420.8 mu of wheat in one day and night shift (17 hours and 16 minutes) on June 30, exceeding the farm's quota by 31.5%, and won the title of Special Grade Expert Team. The Yuan Jiazhi horse-drawn harvester team created a new record of harvesting 155 mu per day, exceeding the farm's quota by 55%. Maimaiti Balati, a Uyghur farmer who was an intern at the farm, created a new record of bundling 20.5 mu of wheat per day.

	The wheat of Shengli Farm this year has full grains and plump ears. According to preliminary identification, the yield per mu in high-yield fields is more than 600 jin, and the yield in large fields has also generally increased. The Ukrainian 0246 winter wheat and red winter wheat have now been harvested, and all spring wheat can be harvested by mid-July. (Ke Xun)
