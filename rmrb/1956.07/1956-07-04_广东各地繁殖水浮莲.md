Guangdong is propagating water hyacinth
    (Reported by this newspaper) Water hyacinth – a good pig feed – is being cultivated in large quantities in Guangdong Province. Currently, there are more than 30,000 ponds across the province, all covered with water hyacinth like green carpets. In the counties along the Pearl River and Han River, where propagation is more extensive, the water hyacinth quickly covers the pond surface due to the farmers' careful cultivation. Now, the agricultural cooperative's livestock keepers can collect basket after basket of water hyacinth every day to feed the pigs. In Luoyang Agricultural Production Cooperative of Panyu County, pigs fed with water hyacinth gained an average of twenty-five jin in weight per head within a month. Since the establishment of water hyacinth and other feed bases in Shantou Prefecture, many cooperative members have revised their pig-raising plans, increasing the number of pigs raised in the region by more than 62,000. By the end of June, the province will expand the water hyacinth propagation area to 100,000 mu. Once this plan is realized, at least 6 million pigs can get sufficient green fodder.
    The water hyacinth of Guangdong has aroused the interest of farmers in southern provinces. In the past two months, many water hyacinth seedlings have been successively transported to Hunan, Hubei, Anhui, Jiangsu, Nanjing, Shanghai, and other provinces and cities for propagation.

    广东各地繁殖水浮莲
    本报讯　水浮莲——一种良好的饲猪饲料正在广东省大量种植。目前，全省约有三万多口池塘，都铺满了像片片绿毯一样的水浮莲。在繁殖较多的珠江，韩江两岸各县，由于农民们的细心培育，水浮莲很快就把塘面遮满了。现在农业社的饲养员每天都能满筐满筐地捞回去喂猪。番禺县螺阳农业生产合作社用水浮莲喂的猪，每头在一个月内就增加了体重二十五斤。汕头专区自从大量建立水浮莲等饲料基地后，许多社员都修订了养猪计划，全区共增养生猪六万二千多头。全省在六月底水浮莲的繁殖面积将扩大到十万亩，这个计划实现后，至少可以使六百万头猪得到充足的青饲料。
    广东的水浮莲已引起南方各省农民的兴趣。最近两个月来，已有许多水浮莲的种苗陆续运到湖南、湖北、安徽、江苏、南京、上海等省、市繁殖。（肖俊城）
