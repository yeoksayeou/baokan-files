Beside the Ten-Ton Air Hammer
By our reporter Chen Ji

    The air hammer in the forging workshop of the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant is operating. The tremendous sound is like rolling thunder, surging waves. Standing in the factory building, you can't hear the sound of speaking, only feel the floor vibrating slightly.

    A middle-aged man approached the ten-ton air hammer. Many young people following behind him pricked up their ears to listen to his explanation. I remember seeing him a month ago, holding iron tongs, clamping a steel material weighing more than a hundred pounds, and putting it into the die of the air hammer. With a few "boom-dong" sounds, in about a minute, a crooked crankshaft was forged. At that time, I found his calm expression strange: Why was he so skilled in mastering the technology of forging crankshafts?

    Today he stood beside the air hammer, eloquently explaining the structure of the air hammer to the young workers. He is the deputy director of the die forging section of the forging workshop, named Bao Fusi. Seventeen years ago, he had used iron hammers in blacksmith shops and also used free forging hammers; but he never knew that there was such a thing as a steam die forging hammer in the world. When he saw me, he pointed to the material of the crankshaft and said, "Look, this thing weighs more than one hundred and thirty pounds, but it can't withstand a few blows from the air hammer. If there were no such air hammer, even if you were a Hercules with three heads and six arms, you wouldn't be able to forge a good crankshaft!" As he spoke, a happy smile appeared on his face.

    Bao Fusi and several other forgers from blacksmith backgrounds had recently returned from an internship in the forging workshops of Soviet automobile factories. Internship is not a very unfamiliar thing for Soviet workers either. Some veteran Soviet workers had tasted the experience of interning in the United States. At that time, they had to hang large signs on their chests, and they were not allowed to look at machines or take notes; the little knowledge they learned was only secretly told to them by American workers. Now these veteran Soviet workers say to Bao Fusi, "We will take the machines apart for you to see, send specialists to explain the theory to you, so that you can quickly become experts in manufacturing Chinese automobiles."

    Bao Fusi remembers the scene of learning to operate the air hammer for the first time in the Soviet automobile factory. His Soviet mentor, foreman Borie, kindly called him, "Come and forge the front axle beam, don't be afraid!" Bao Fusi walked to the front of the five-ton air hammer, stepped on the footboard, and with a "boom" sound, the front axle beam slid out and became a waste product. He was very sad, lowered his eyelids, and said shyly to Foreman Borie:
    “I made a waste product, I'm very sorry. It delays your production and wastes your steel."
    "Why are you sad? Are you afraid of difficulties? Do you know what you came here for?" Foreman Borie asked him.
    "To learn the technology and manufacture Chinese automobiles in the future."
    "That's right! Then why are you discouraged when you produce a waste product?"
    "I'm not discouraged, I'm afraid of producing more waste products, which will affect you..."
    "Your thinking is wrong. Do Soviet workers begrudge their quotas in order to help China? Do they still care about the loss of dozens of front axle beams? Who doesn't produce a few waste products the first time they work? Producing some waste products now will teach you what to do when you return to China in the future. You must muster up the courage to continue."
    Foreman Borie helped him adjust the mold, and personally forged several front axle beams for him to see. With his help, Bao Fusi forged several front axle beams, and none of them were waste products. Foreman Borie hugged him tightly and said repeatedly, "Very good, hurry up and get to work!"

    Bao Fusi talked to me about his internship in the Soviet Union as if it had just happened. He said, "Our life in the Soviet factory was like being at home. Soviet workers rushed to accompany us for meals, shopping, and movies. Wherever we went, Soviet workers surrounded us and asked us what difficulties we had. They said, 'We feel happy to do anything for Chinese comrades.' Once, our Soviet foreman patiently introduced us to the management methods of molds. At this time, the workshop director came, inspected the foreman's work, and suddenly put on a stern face and asked him:
    ‘Why haven’t you arranged your work properly?’
    ‘Yes, I didn’t arrange my work well, I should be criticized. But now I want to explain the mold to the Chinese comrades, and I can't spare the time. I promise to make up for the work today.’
    ‘Okay, you did the right thing, teach the Chinese comrades well.’ The workshop director walked away with a smile.
    "At that time, we were afraid that the Soviet foreman would delay his work, and asked him to talk about it the day after tomorrow. He disagreed and continued to talk until we all understood, then he went to do his own work.
    "Some of us were so moved to tears by the help of the Soviet comrades." Bao Fusi said to me, "After we all learned the mold forging technology, the Soviet comrades were still not at ease. Before we left, they used a clever examination method to remind us to pay attention to all the small problems." Then, Bao Fusi told me the following story.

    Wang Hanqing, who went to the Soviet Union with him for an internship, was an old worker who had been a blacksmith for twenty years. He learned to master the flat forging machine in the Soviet automobile factory and learned very quickly. He learned to make valves in a month. His Soviet mentor, Lulyov, carefully studied his operation methods and found that he had a shortcoming: he did not pay attention to the inspection work before production. Once, Lulyov came to Wang Hanqing with many Chinese interns to test Wang Hanqing's skills. Wang Hanqing thought to himself: What kind of exam is this? He forced himself to calm down, installed the mold, started the flat forging machine, and made a valve with a few "ding-dong" sounds. Upon inspection, the quality of the valve was good. Lulyov smiled and gave a thumbs up, saying, "Very good, now go over there and get the tools." Wang Hanqing didn't know what was going on, so he slowly walked to another place and took the tools. Lulyov said, "Give me the tools, and make another valve to see." Wang Hanqing hurriedly started the flat forging machine, and suddenly the machine made a strange noise, and the valve was broken. He was very surprised: Why did he do well just now, but this time it turned into a waste product? He looked up at Lulyov, Lulyov looked at him with a straight face, and many Chinese interns were silent. He felt panicked and his face was flushed. Looking at the flat forging machine, there was no problem; looking at the mold again, he suddenly found that the two molds were high and low, "What's going on? How did the mold change?" He had no choice but to level the mold and made another valve, and no accident occurred. At this time, Lulyov came over and said with a smile, "You have learned well, but you still have shortcomings, that is, you lack inspection after leaving and starting the flat forging machine for the second time." An intern quietly told Wang Hanqing: "When you went to get the tools, Lulyov secretly removed a shim from one of the molds. You didn't check, so there was a problem. Your mentor is too good, he examined you like this to deepen your impression and let you pay attention to inspection work in the future." "Oh, I will never forget this lesson in my life." Wang Hanqing took a deep breath. His Soviet mentor Lulyov winked at him and smiled.

    The story of Wang Hanqing being tested is deeply imprinted in the hearts of many interns. Bao Fusi said, "After we returned to China, we adjusted the equipment and trial-produced parts, and we paid great attention to inspection work. The reason why we haven't had major accidents to this day is because we pay attention to all possible problems." Bao Fusi said with relish, and the young workers were all fascinated.

    It's almost time to get off work. Bao Fusi's surroundings were still crowded with young workers. A female worker told me, "Our Director Bao is just like the Soviet comrades, patiently teaching us technology. The forgers in our die forging department and flat forging department used to be blacksmiths and students. Now, with the help of comrades like Bao Fusi and Wang Hanqing, they have become new types of forgers. ..."

    "Boom-boom-dong-dong", the sound of the die forging hammer rises and falls one after another. As I left the forging workshop, an engineer told me, "The die forging hammer is outdated and will soon be replaced by mechanical forging presses. We have just learned to take the first step, but this is only the first step of the Long March."

    在十吨重的气锤旁边
    本报记者　陈迹
    第一汽车制造厂锻工车间的气锤开动了。巨大的声响，好像春雷滚动，波涛翻腾。站在厂房里，听不清讲话的声音，只感到地板微微震动。
    一个中年人走近十吨重的气锤旁边。跟随在他后面的许多年轻人竖起耳朵，听他讲解。我记得一个月以前，曾经看见他手拿铁钳，夹住一百多斤重的钢材，放入气锤的型槽里，嘣咚几声，约摸一分钟，一个弯弯扭扭的曲轴打成了。当时我看他那不慌不忙的神情，觉得奇怪：为什么他能这样熟练地掌握锻造曲轴的技术？
    今天他站在气锤旁边，滔滔不绝地向年轻工人解释气锤的构造。他是锻工车间模锻工部副主任，名叫鲍福四。十七年前，他在铁匠铺用铁锤打过铁，也用过自由锻锤；但从来也不知道世界上还有蒸汽模锻锤。他见到我，指指曲轴的材料说道：“你瞧，这家伙一百三十多斤重，但经不住气锤打几下。要是没有这种气锤，那怕你是三头六臂的大力士，也打不好曲轴呵！”他说着，露出幸福的微笑。
    鲍福四是不久以前同另外几个铁匠出身的锻工，从苏联的汽车厂锻工车间实习回国的。实习，对苏联工人说来也不是很生疏的事情。有些苏联老工人曾经尝过在美国实习的滋味。那时候，他们要在胸前挂上大牌牌，不能看机器、记笔记；他们学到的一点东西，只是美国工人偷偷告诉他们的。现在这些苏联老工人对鲍福四说：“我们要把机器拆开给你们看，派专人给你们讲理论，让你们赶快成为制造中国汽车的能手。”
    鲍福四记得在苏联的汽车厂第一次学习操纵气锤的情景。他的苏联导师——工长波列亲切地叫他：“你来打前梁，不要怕！”鲍福四走到五吨重的气锤前面，蹬起脚板，气锤嘣哧一声，前梁滑出去了，变成了废品。他非常难过，垂下眼皮，害羞地对波列工长说：
      “我打了个废品，很对不起你们。耽误你们生产，又浪费了你们的钢材。”
      “你为什么难过？害怕困难吗？你知道，你到我们这里来是为了什么？”波列工长问他。
      “为了学好技术，将来制造中国汽车。”
      “对呀！那你为什么出了废品，就灰心呢？”
      “我不灰心，我怕再出废品，影响你们……”
      “你这样想法不对，苏联工人为了帮助中国，难道吝惜自己的定额吗？难道还在乎几十个前梁的损失吗？谁第一次干活不出几个废品？现在出些废品，将来回中国去就知道怎么做。你要鼓足勇气干下去。”
    波列工长帮助他调整好模子，又亲手打了几个前梁给他看，鲍福四在他帮助下，打了几个前梁，都没废品。波列工长紧紧抱住他，连说：“好得很，快干吧！”
    鲍福四跟我说起在苏联实习的事情，好像说刚才发生的事情一样。他说：“我们在苏联工厂生活，就同在家里一样。吃饭、买东西、看电影，苏联工人都抢着陪我们一起去。我们走到那里，都有苏联工人围着问我们有什么困难。他们说：‘我们能为中国同志办什么事，都感到幸福。’有一次，我们的苏联工长向我们耐心地介绍模子的管理方法。这时候，车间主任来了，他检查了工长的工作，忽然板起面孔问他：
      ‘你为什么没有布置好工作？’
      ‘是的，我工作布置得不好，应该受批评。但是现在我要给中国同志讲模子，抽不出时间来。我保证今天把工作补上。’
      ‘好，你做得对，好好教中国同志吧。’车间主任笑嘻嘻地走了。
      “当时我们害怕苏联工长耽误了工作，要求他隔一天再讲。他不同意，一直讲到我们全都懂了，他才去做自己的工作。
    “苏联同志这样帮助我们，我们有些人都感动得流泪。”鲍福四对我说：“在我们都学会模段技术以后，苏联同志还不放心，在我们临走之前，采用一种巧妙的考试方法，来提醒我们注意一切微小的问题。”接着，鲍福四就给我讲了下面这个故事。
    同他一起去实习的王汉清，是个干了二十年铁匠的老工人。他到苏联的汽车厂学习掌握平锻机，学得很快，一个月就学会了做气门。他的苏联导师卢辽夫仔细研究他的操作方法，发现他有一个缺点：不注意生产前的检查工作。有一次，卢辽夫同许多中国实习生来找王汉清，要考考王汉清的技术。王汉清心里想：这是什么样的考试呀？他强作镇静，安好模子，开动平锻机，叮咚几下，做好一个气门。一检查，气门质量良好。卢辽夫满面春风，伸出大姆指，说道：“很好，现在你到那边去拿工具来。”王汉清不知道怎么回事，慢慢走到另一个地方，拿来工具。卢辽夫说：“把工具给我，你再干一个气门看看。”王汉清急忙开动平锻机，忽然机器发出怪声，气门被打坏了。他很惊奇：为什么刚才干得好，这一次却出了废品呢？他抬头看看卢辽夫，卢辽夫嘣着脸看他，许多中国实习生也不作声。他心里发慌，满脸通红。看看平锻机，没有毛病；又瞧瞧模子，忽然发现两个模子一高一低，“怎么搞的？模子怎么会变样呀？”他无可奈何地把模子垫平，又做了个气门，没有发生事故。这时候，卢辽夫走过来，笑迷迷地说：“你学得不坏，但是还有缺点，就是你离开之后，第二次开动平锻机，缺少检查。”一位实习生悄悄地告诉王汉清：“在你去拿工具的时候，卢辽夫偷偷抽去一个模子的垫板，你没检查，所以出了毛病。你这位导师太好了，他这样考你，是加深你的印象，让你以后注意检查工作，”“哎呀，这个教训我一世也忘不了。”王汉清深深地吸了一口气。他的苏联导师卢辽夫向他挤挤眼睛，笑了。
    王汉清被考试的故事，深深地刻印在许多实习生的心里。鲍福四说：“我们回国以后，调整设备，试制零件，都非常注意检查工作。我们到今天所以不出大事故，就是因为我们注意了一切可能犯的毛病。”鲍福四津津有味地说着，年轻工人们都听得入了迷。
    快要下班了。鲍福四的周围还挤满了年轻工人。一位女工告诉我：“我们的鲍主任也跟苏联同志一样，耐心地教我们技术。我们模锻工部和平锻工部的锻工，过去都是铁匠、学生。现在在鲍福四、王汉清等同志的帮助下，都成了新型的锻工。……”
    嘣嘣咚咚，模锻锤的声音此起彼伏。当我离开锻工车间的时候，一位工程师告诉我：“模锻锤已经落伍了，它快要被机械锻压机所代替了。我们刚刚学会走了第一步，但这只是万里长征的第一步。”
