Reader's Opinion

    I do not approve of sports competitions between children and adults
    The People's Daily on June 4th, on page three, published a news item about a football exhibition match between the Lüda City Youth Football Team and the Dalian Cement Factory Workers' Football Team. I have the following opinions regarding this report: Children's sports activities must be conducted according to their age characteristics, otherwise, it will damage the physical and mental development of children and easily cause accidents. Therefore, we should oppose any competition between children and adults on the sports field.
        (Tai Tongyuan, Jiangsu Provincial Educational Cadre School)
      Editor's note: Comrade Tai Tongyuan's opinion is correct. In order to better
  carry out sports activities for children and avoid accidents in sports activities, this
  matter is worthy of attention from schools in various regions. The news published in this newspaper on June 4th was inappropriate.

    我不赞成少年儿童和成人作体育比赛
    六月四日人民日报第三版上登载了旅大市少年足球队和大连市水泥厂职工足球队举行足球表演赛的消息。我对这一报道有以下一些意见：儿童体育活动必须根据他们的年龄特点进行，否则，将会损害儿童的身心发展，并很容易发生事故。所以，我们应该反对少年儿童和成人在运动场上的任何比赛。
        （江苏省教育行政干部学校  邰同元）
      编者按：邰同元同志来信所提的意见是正确的。为了更好地
  开展少年儿童的体育活动，避免在体育活动中发生意外事故，这
  件事情很值得各地学校的注意。本报六月四日所登的新闻是不适
  当的。
