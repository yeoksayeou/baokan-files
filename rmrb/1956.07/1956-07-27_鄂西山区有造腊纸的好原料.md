Xinhua News Agency, Enshi, 25th — The list of local specialties purchased by many supply and marketing cooperatives in the western Hubei mountain region has recently added two new items that have never been purchased before: *Meng Hua* bark and mountain cotton bark. Both *Meng Hua* bark and mountain cotton bark are the main raw materials for making wax paper, and the quality of wax paper made from them is much better than that made from substitutes like *Huang Gou* bark and *San Ya* bark.

In the past, farmers and purchasing staff of supply and marketing cooperatives in the western Hubei mountain region did not recognize *Meng Hua* bark and mountain cotton bark. Not long ago, the Wax Paper Raw Material Purchasing Office of the Zhejiang Provincial Department of Industry's Paper Making Professional Company sent five people to the western Hubei mountain region to see if these raw materials were produced there. As a result, they found that many *Meng Hua* trees and mountain cotton trees grow on the mountains of every county. So, they taught the purchasing agents of local supply and marketing cooperatives the techniques of peeling, processing, and cultivating these two types of trees. After learning, the purchasing agents actively taught the farmers.

Now, the local specialty purchasing departments in the Enshi Special District of western Hubei have signed supply and sales contracts with the demanding units in Zhejiang Province for 850,000 *jin* (approximately 425,000 kilograms) of *Meng Hua* bark and mountain cotton bark. The Enshi Special District financial and economic leading authorities have also set reasonable prices for purchasing *Meng Hua* bark and mountain cotton bark.

### 鄂西山区有造腊纸的好原料

    鄂西山区有造腊纸的好原料
    新华社恩施25日电　鄂西山区许多供销社里的土特产的收购项目表中，最近又增加了两项从来没有收购过的新产品，这就是刚发现的梦花皮和山棉皮。梦花皮和山棉皮都是造腊纸的主要原料，比代用品黄构皮、三桠皮造出的腊纸质量好得多。
    过去，鄂西山区农民和供销社的收购人员都认不得梦花皮和山棉皮。不久前，浙江省工业厅造纸专业公司皮腊纸原料收购处，派了五个人到鄂西山区看是否出产这种原料，结果发现每个县的山上都生长着许多梦花树和山棉树，于是他们就向当地供销社的收购员传授剥皮、加工和培植这两种树的技术。收购员们学会后，又积极向农民传授。
    现在鄂西山区恩施专区的土特产收购部门已经和浙江省需用单位订了八十五万斤梦花皮和山棉皮的供销合同。恩施专区财经领导机关也订出了收购梦花皮和山棉皮的合理价格。
