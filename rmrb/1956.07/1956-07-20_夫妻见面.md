The stable's sewer was blocked. Horse manure water overflowed from the drainage ditch, making the whole place stink. A short, squat young stableman, bareheaded, wearing a mask, with his shirt sleeves rolled up to his shoulders, was hunched over, scooping out the manure from the sewer. The smell of the manure was strong; even ten masks couldn't block it. Just as the young stableman was happily scooping away, the team leader, Ma Deguang, came in and said:

	"Comrade Zhang Bugao, I'll take over. You go wash your hands."
	"Why?"
	"Your wife is here. She's waiting for you at the guest house!"
	"Who, she's here?" Zhang Bugao was taken aback, his face flushed slightly.
	"That's right. Go wash your hands!"
	"No, I don't want to get both of our hands dirty. I'll clear it first."

Zhang Bugao, like he was feeling for a crab, plunged his right arm into the sewer. Unexpectedly, the manure mixed with manure water "splurted" out, splashing all over his body and the ground.

The sewer was cleared. Zhang Bugao stuck his head under the tap, washing himself thoroughly. He put on his military uniform, saluted the team leader, and headed towards the guest house. Just as he left, he pretended to be nonchalant, his steps neither too fast nor too slow. But as soon as he was out of sight, he broke into a run. It was no wonder he was anxious. The young couple had only been married for a month or so when he enlisted in the army. They'd been separated for a year and a half, and now they were about to meet, how could he not be happy?

His wife was standing on the road in front of the guest house waiting for him. She saw a short, squat figure running towards her from afar, and went to meet him.

The couple met. They didn't call out each other's names, didn't shake hands, their faces flushed slightly, and then they walked slowly side by side. His wife said, a mix of happiness and reproach in her voice:

	"Silly man, I've been waiting for you for ages, and you didn't come!"
	"People have work to do," Zhang Bugao said, still catching his breath.

She handed her handkerchief to her husband and said, "Look at the sweat on your face!"

The wife looked at her husband from head to toe, and then from toe to head, unable to get enough of him. Suddenly, she saw the mud on her husband's shoes and said, "What were you doing, getting your feet all covered in stinky mud?"

Zhang Bugao suddenly remembered that he had been too anxious to change his shoes before coming, and felt a little regretful. But then he thought, they're husband and wife, they shouldn't be too particular about this, so he said nonchalantly:

	"Working in the stables, how can you not get a little dirty!"
	"Look at you, you're not even as good as a peasant!"

Because it was their first meeting, and he was feeling warm inside, Zhang Bugao didn't argue with his wife.

Before and after dinner, the couple chatted about many family matters, and they seemed to get along well. But when they went to bed that night, things became a little unpleasant. His wife said crossly:

	"You're so stubborn. No job is better than being a stableman! If you learned to drive a car, you could drive a tractor for our village cooperative when you get back; if you learned to be a telephone operator, you could manage a telephone at our village cooperative when you get back. But you just love being a good-for-nothing stableman. Our village cooperative doesn't even have horses for you to feed!"

Zhang Bugao chuckled:

	"Look at what you're thinking! I'm serving in the military to contribute to the country, not to be a 'returned student.' Whatever the army needs me to do, I'll do it. I can't argue!"
	"Well, you have high ideals. I can't argue with you. Doesn't working at the cooperative count as working for the country?"

Zhang Bugao put his mouth to his wife's ear and said, "Working at the cooperative is important, but the entire national defense is even more important. Think about it, how many thousands of cooperatives are the comrades in the army protecting? Someone has to do every job. Doing a job isn't like buying pears and dates, picking and choosing. That would be chaos, what kind of army would that be!"

His wife didn't say anything.

In the middle of the night, Zhang Bugao quietly got out of bed. His wife opened her eyes slightly and said:

	"Where are you going in the middle of the night?"

Zhang Bugao said apologetically:

	"The horses are waiting for me to give them water!"

As soon as his wife heard this, she turned her back with a "plop" and pouted, saying, "It seems like your heart is bewitched by the animals!"

Zhang Bugao said with a smile:

	"Don't be angry with me. The animals can't bewitch my heart, it's the work the army has assigned me that has bewitched my heart."

    夫妻见面
    龚德
    马房里的下水道塞住了。马粪水溢出了流水沟，搞得满屋子臭哄哄的。一位矮蹲蹲的青年饲养员，光着头，戴着口罩，衬衣袖卷到肩膀头，勾勾着腰，掏着下水道里的粪泥。粪泥的味儿可重，就是戴上十个口罩，也挡不住它。青年饲养员正掏得欢，组长马德光走进来说：
    “张步高同志，我来掏，你洗手去。”
    “为什么？”
    “你老婆来啦，她在招待所等你哩！”
    “谁，她来啦？”张步高愣了一下，脸有些红。
    “对。快去洗手吧！”
    “不，别沾脏了两个人的手，我掏通了再说。”
    张步高像摸螃蟹一样，右胳膊猛地伸进下水道。没想到，粪泥夹着粪水，“噗嗤”一下，溅得身上地上全是。
    下水道掏通了。张步高把头扎在自来水龙头下，哗里哗啦洗了个痛快。他穿上军服，向组长敬了个礼，往招待所走去。刚出门，他还装得若无其事，步子跨得不松不紧。但等到别人看不见他了，他就跑起步来。也难怪他心急。小俩口结婚才个把月，他就报名服兵役了。一分开就是一年半，现在要见面了，怎能叫他不高兴。
    妻子站在招待所门前的路上等他。她见老远有个矮蹲蹲的人向这边跑着，便迎上去。
    夫妻俩一碰面，没叫名，没握手，脸红了一下，便并肩慢步走起来。妻子喜里带嗔说：
    “傻人，等你半天，你也不来！”
    “人家有工作嘛。”张步高还喘着气。
    她递手帕给丈夫说：“看你脸上的汗！”
    妻子从头到脚，从脚到头，把丈夫看个不够。忽然，看到丈夫的鞋上泥乎乎的，说：“干什么啦，弄得满脚腥泥？”
    张步高猛想起临来太性急了，没来及把鞋子换下来，有点后悔。但又一想，夫妻嘛，不能太较量这个，便不介意地说：
    “在马房工作，哪能一点脏东西不沾！”
    “看你，还不如个乡下人哩！”
    因为初见面，心里热乎乎的，张步高没和妻子顶。
    晚饭前后，夫妻俩叙了许多家常，谈得还算顺心。到晚上，两人睡下了，倒闹得有些不痛快。妻子气鼓鼓地说：
      “你这死心眼，什么工作不比当马伕强！你学个开汽车的，将后回咱村合作社还能开个拖拉机；学个打电话的，将后回咱村合作社还能管个电话机。可是你偏爱当个没出息的马伕，咱村合作社可没马给你喂！”
    张步高“嘿”地笑了：
    “看你想到哪去啦！我服义务兵役是为国家出力，不是来当‘留洋生’的。部队上需要我干啥，我干啥，还能说二话！”
    “嗯，你理论高，我说不过你。合作社上的工作就不为国家？” 
    张步高的嘴凑到妻子耳朵上说：“社里工作是重要，可整个国防事业更重要呵。你想，部队里的同志，在保卫多少万个合作社？啥工作都得有人干。干工作又不像买梨买枣，这个也挑，那个也捡，那不乱套了，还成什么军队！”
    妻子不言声了。
    睡到半夜，张步高悄悄地起床了。妻子扣扣眼说：
    “半夜三更上哪？”
    张步高抱歉地说：
    “马等我去喂水呢！”
    妻子一听，“咕咚”背转身，噘着嘴说：“看你的心叫牲口迷住了！”
    张步高笑嘻嘻地说：
    “别生我的气。牲口迷不了我的心，是部队交给我的工作迷了我的心。”
