    Activating Democratic Life Within the Party, Giving Play to the Enthusiasm of Party Members
    Over 1,000 Counties Nationwide Have Held Party Congresses
    (Our Newspaper News) A delegate who attended the CCP Jiangxi Xinjian County Party Congress said: "For several years, words I didn't dare to say and opinions I didn't dare to raise were all spoken at this representative assembly." Since March of this year, 1,402 counties (cities and banners) across the country have convened party congresses. The vast majority of these congresses, like the one in Xinjian County, Jiangxi, fully promoted intra-party democracy and boldly launched criticism from the bottom up. This demonstrates the further improvement of the class consciousness of the broad masses of party members and the further activation of democratic life within the party.
    These party congresses are a profound and vivid lesson in intra-party democracy for the vast number of party members, whether they are new or ordinary, old or responsible for work within the Party. A representative from Muleng County, Heilongjiang, who recently joined the Party said: "This is the first time since I joined the Party that I have received such a profound intra-party democratic education." A County Committee member from Yuanjiang County, Hunan, said: "The representatives dug deep into my shortcomings and their criticisms were piercing. It was the best assessment of me." The Party committees in many counties once held incorrect views and unnecessary concerns about promoting democracy and conducting criticism at the Party Congresses. For example, they believed that the representatives had a "low level" and would not be able to offer any opinions on the work report of the County Committee, and they worried that the representatives' criticism would lead to chaos, etc. As a result, there was a phenomenon of not daring to promote democracy and restricting the speeches of representatives to varying degrees at the Party Congresses in some counties. However, when the representatives launched sharp but realistic criticisms of the work of the Party Committee, and when the representatives put forward positive suggestions for improving leadership and work in the future, the incorrect views of the Party Committee changed, and the unnecessary worries were eliminated.
    Another prominent feature of the Party Congresses at the county level is that they carefully and seriously reviewed the candidates for the Party Committee based on the Party's principle of selecting cadres with both ability and integrity. They boldly criticized the mistakes and shortcomings of the candidates in their work and thinking, and replaced some candidates who had committed serious mistakes and were unwilling to examine and recognize their own mistakes. They elected a new Party Committee that everyone was satisfied with. In the elections, all localities also paid special attention to selecting new forces, adding new blood to the Party's leading organs. Sixty-six counties (cities) in Heilongjiang elected a total of 1,008 members, of whom 582 were newly promoted.
    Because the vast majority of the Party Congresses in the counties across the country were conducted relatively well, they greatly promoted the improvement of the Party's work and encouraged the enthusiasm and creativity of the Party members. The newly elected County Committee of Jiangning County, Jiangsu, recently selected seven County Committee members to go deep into the agricultural cooperatives to specifically help the agricultural cooperatives do a good job in the summer harvest, summer planting, and summer pre-distribution, changing the leadership style of not going deep into reality in the past. The representative of the Gaoying Township Party Branch of Tongshan County, Jiangsu, who attended the County Party Congress, returned to his hometown and, in accordance with the spirit of the County Party Congress, closely integrated with the leadership style of the Party Branch to carry out criticism and self-criticism, which greatly encouraged the enthusiasm of the Party members. The Party members of the whole township immediately took practical actions to lead the masses to devote themselves to the summer harvest, and in just three days, they harvested 1,400 mu of wheat.

    活跃党内民主生活，发挥党员的积极性
    全国一千多个县开了党代表大会
    本报讯　一个参加中共江西新建县党代表大会的代表说：“几年来不敢讲的话，不敢提的意见，在这次代表大会上全都说出来了。”从今年三月以来，全国已有1，402个县（市和旗）召开了党代表大会，绝大部分党代表大会都像江西新建县那个代表反映的一样，充分发扬了党内民主，大胆开展了自下而上的批评。这说明了广大党员群众阶级觉悟的进一步提高和党内民主生活的进一步活跃。
    这些党代表大会对于广大党员，不管是新党员和一般党员，不管是老党员和在党内担任负责工作的党员，都是一次很深刻很生动的党内民主教育。黑龙江穆棱县一个新参加党不久的代表说：这是我入党以来第一次受到这样深刻的党内民主教育”。湖南沅江县一个县委委员说：“代表们对我的缺点挖的深，刺的痛，是对我的一次最好的鉴定”。不少县的党委会曾经对在党代表大会上发扬民主开展批评抱着不正确的看法和不必要的顾虑。比如认为代表“水平低”，对县委的工作报告提不出什么意见，再如担心代表们展开批评以后，会不会搞乱等等，因而在有些县的党代表大会上曾经程度不等地存在着不敢发扬民主、限制代表发言的现象。但是，当代表们展开了对党委会工作尖锐的而又实事求是的批评以后，当代表们对今后改进领导和改进工作提出了积极建议以后，党委会不正确的看法改变了，不必要的顾虑消除了。
    各县党代表大会另一个突出的特点是依据党的德才兼备的干部政策的原则，认真、严肃地审查了党委会的候选人，对候选人工作中和思想中的错误和缺点作了大胆的批评，并对一些既犯有较严重的错误，又不愿很好检查和认识自己错误的候选人作了调换，选举产生了大家满意的新的党委会。在选举中各地还特别注意选拔了新生力量，给党的领导机关增加了新的血液。黑龙江六十六个县（市）共选出了一千零八名委员，其中有五百八十二名是新提拔的。
    由于全国各县党代表大会绝大部分开得比较好，就大大促进了党的工作的改进，鼓舞了党员群众的积极性和创造性。江苏江宁县新选出的县委会，最近抽出了七名县委委员深入农业合作社，具体帮助农业社做好夏收夏种和夏季预分工作，改变了过去不深入实际的领导作风。江苏铜山县高营乡党支部出席县党代表大会的代表回乡后，根据县党代表大会的精神密切结合党支部的领导作风开展了批评和自我批评，因而大大地鼓舞了党员的积极性。全乡党员即以实际行动带领群众投入夏收，在短短的三天中就抢收了一千四百亩小麦。
