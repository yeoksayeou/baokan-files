    "The patterns are all the same, always with flowers and leaves; the flowers are about six-tenths in size, neither too close nor too far apart."

    This poem is used by some to satirize commercial workers responsible for purchasing floral fabrics, saying that the fabrics they choose are all of this style; others use it to satirize floral fabric pattern designers, saying that no matter how they design, they always stick to this type of pattern. These floral fabrics with largely similar patterns did indeed flood the market for a time, causing consumer dissatisfaction. Regardless of who it's directed at, besides the unattractive colors, there are sometimes inexplicable patterns, such as the "separated mandarin ducks" quilt cover produced by the state-owned Liaoning Printing and Dyeing Factory, and the "solitary mandarin duck" quilt cover produced by the Changzhou Dacheng No. 2 Printing and Dyeing Factory. Mandarin ducks are inherently birds that pair up and never live alone. In China, since ancient times, poets and painters have often used "mandarin ducks separated" to describe the pain of parting. For example, in the Yue Opera "The Story of the Western Wing," when Zhang Sheng is forced to leave Yingying, he sings: "Unexpectedly, joy has not ended and sorrow follows, in an instant, mandarin ducks are separated in two places." Who doesn't want to live beautifully, who wants to live a tragic life? The patterns of "separated mandarin ducks" and "solitary mandarin ducks," since they violate natural phenomena, customs, and people's wishes, it's no wonder people don't like them.

    The Liaoning Printing and Dyeing Factory also produces a floral fabric with a green background and pink flowers. The flower pattern is quite beautiful. Unfortunately, the designers believe that a green background and pink flowers cannot reflect the current life and ideological outlook of the Chinese people, so they printed conspicuous political slogans such as "Strive Forward," "Unite and Love Each Other," and "Happy Life" between the pink flowers. The designer's intention is expressed, but consumers don't like this kind of fabric. They don't want to wear these slogans on their bodies.

    There are many similar unpopular fabrics. In short, consumers not only demand diversification of flower patterns, but also that the "transformation" is well done. Some designers believe that so-called "good" or "bad" is mainly a matter of aesthetic viewpoint. Perhaps, there is indeed a divergence in aesthetic viewpoints between designers and general consumers. Here, we won't discuss whether patterns like "solitary mandarin ducks" and those filled with slogans are "beautiful" enough. Let's take a step back and say, even if they are "beautiful," but consumers don't recognize or approve of them, what should be done? Who should yield to whom? Floral fabric patterns are not exactly the same as general works of art. Whether people appreciate a work of art or not is of little consequence. However, floral fabric patterns are to be printed on thousands upon thousands of bolts of cloth for consumers, especially women and children, to make clothes. If consumers don't like it, the country's materials will be stockpiled or sold at a reduced price, resulting in losses. Therefore, floral fabric pattern designers should always consider consumers' preferences, and while overcoming the problem of patterns being the same, they should also pay attention to the fact that consumers don't like "solitary mandarin ducks" and don't like slogans appearing on their clothes.

    为何鸳鸯不成双
    孔桑
    “花样千篇一律，都要有花有叶；花朵六分左右，距离不紧不密。”
    这首诗，有人用来讽刺一些负责选购花布的商业工作人员，说他们所选的花布，都是这一种样式；也有人用来讽刺一些花布图案设计人员，说他们设计来设计去，总离不开这一类的图案。这种花型图案大同小异的花布，的确一度充斥市场，引起消费者的不满。不管是对谁来说吧，总之，除了花色不好看而外，有时还有一些莫明其妙的图案，例如国营辽宁印染厂生产的印有“分家鸳鸯”的被面，和常州大成第二印染厂生产的印有“独宿鸳鸯”的被面。鸳鸯本来是一种匹鸟，从来是不独宿的。在我国，自古以来，吟诗绘画的人，往往以“鸳鸯分家”来形容别离的痛苦。如越剧西厢记里张生被迫离开莺莺时所唱的：“却不料合欢未已愁相继，顷刻间拆散鸳鸯分两地”。谁不愿意生活得美丽一些，谁愿意过悲剧性的生活？“分家鸳鸯”、“独宿鸳鸯”的图案，既然是违反自然现象，违反风俗习惯，违反人民愿望的，就难怪人们不喜欢它了。
    辽宁印染厂还生产一种绿底，粉红色花朵的花布。花型是相当美的。可惜设计者却认为绿底，粉红色的花不能反映我国人民目前的生活和思想面貌，因而在粉红色的花朵之间，印上很醒目的“努力前进”、“团结友爱”、“幸福生活”等政治口号。设计者的意图是表现出来了，但是消费者不喜欢这种花布。他们不愿意把这些标语贴在身上。
    类似这些不受欢迎的花布还很多。总之，消费者不只要求花型图案多样化，而且要求“化”得好。有的设计者认为所谓“好”或“坏”，主要是审美观点问题。也许，这的确是设计者跟一般消费者的审美观点有分歧。这里暂且不说“独宿鸳鸯”和写满标语口号之类的图案够不够“美”，我们退一步说，就算它们是“美”的，但是消费者不承认，不批准，怎么办呢？谁该迁就谁呢？花布图案跟一般美术作品不完全一样。对一件美术作品，人们欣赏或不欣赏它，关系是不大的。可是，花布图案是要印在成千上万匹布上，给消费者特别是妇女和小孩做衣服的。消费者不喜欢它，国家的物资就会被积压，或者被贬价出售，受到损失。所以，花布的花型图案设计人员，应该时刻考虑消费者的爱好，在克服图案千篇一律的毛病的时候，也要注意消费者不喜欢“独宿鸳鸯”，不喜欢在衣服上出现标语口号。
