Xinhua News Agency, 30th – The First Session of the Third National People's Congress has successfully completed all items on its agenda this afternoon and declared its closure.

Vice Premier Chen Yun and Premier Zhou Enlai of the State Council delivered important speeches at today's meeting, one after the other.

In his speech today, Premier Zhou Enlai first represented the State Council in accepting the earnest criticisms made by the delegates regarding the government's work during the discussions at the congress.

Premier Zhou said: "This meeting has been very successful. Among the 163 speeches made during the twelve sessions, with the exception of twenty-eight speeches made by representatives of government organs reporting on their work, the majority of the delegates raised many opinions and conducted earnest criticisms of the government's work. The same spirit was displayed in the small group discussions of the various electoral units. I represent the State Council in expressing our acceptance of these criticisms, studying these opinions, and our willingness to supervise the relevant departments and localities in actual work, to examine and correct these shortcomings and errors, and to improve the work of the government in all aspects."

Premier Zhou then provided explanations and answers regarding several important issues concerning government work raised by the delegates in their speeches, namely, issues concerning various systems, issues concerning financial work, issues concerning the lives of workers and the masses, issues concerning cultural and educational work, and issues concerning the fight against bureaucracy.

When Premier Zhou spoke about the relationship between the central government and local governments, he emphasized that the division of powers between the central and local governments is clearly stipulated in the Constitution. Now, due to the victory of our country's socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce, the relations of production have undergone fundamental changes, and the productive forces will be greatly improved. In order to adapt to this new situation, the division of powers between the central and local governments should be more specific. Democratic centralism is the principle of our country's political system. Implementing appropriate decentralization between the central and local governments under the unified leadership of the central government is to better unleash the enthusiasm and creativity of local governments and the broad masses of the people in developing production and strengthening work. This is more conducive to socialist construction. This division of powers is specifically manifested in various systems. The State Council is currently preparing for the formulation of various systems.

When talking about financial work, Premier Zhou said that based on the opinions of the delegates at this congress, the State Council is preparing to formulate the planned control figures and budget control figures for 1957 starting in July this year, so that they can be issued to various localities for discussion as early as possible. In this way, it will be possible to formulate the draft budget for 1957 earlier.

Premier Zhou Enlai emphasized when explaining the issue of the lives of workers and the masses that in the past we put forward the policy of "improving the lives of workers and the masses on the basis of developing production and increasing labor productivity," which is correct; conversely, appropriately increasing the wages of workers and improving their lives is precisely to promote the further increase of labor productivity.

Then, Premier Zhou made explanations on adjusting the wages of workers, improving workers' housing conditions, rationally arranging workers' leisure time, and further resolving issues such as workers' labor protection and medical care.

Regarding cultural, educational, and health work, Premier Zhou said that due to the development of all aspects of work, the graduates of universities and specialized colleges are far from sufficient for distribution. He said that the government is prepared to seriously solve this problem. He requested that state organs and factories and mines allow some young people who meet the admission requirements to apply for universities to expand the source of students.

Premier Zhou also talked about gradually solving the problems of few teachers, few classrooms, and few books and instruments; talked about reforming the medical system and improving pharmaceutical operations; and talked about the combination of scientific planning and key construction.

Finally, when talking about the issue of fighting bureaucracy, Premier Zhou said that the criticisms of this shortcoming by many delegates have hit the nail on the head. He said: Generally speaking, the higher the leading organs, the more likely they are to become detached from the masses and detached from reality, and the more likely they are to commit the fault of bureaucracy. The larger the administrative establishment and the more documents there are, the easier it is to commit the fault of bureaucracy. Therefore, the personnel working in the central leading organs should be particularly self-aware, should always pay attention to listening to the opinions from the people and lower-level staff, and should greatly promote democracy.

Premier Zhou emphatically pointed out: It is necessary to improve leadership methods, pay attention to investigation and research, general instructions must be combined with specific leadership, and general meetings must be combined with typical investigations. It is necessary to launch criticism from top to bottom and from bottom to top, and to carry out unremitting struggle to improve work efficiency and fight bureaucracy.

Vice Premier Chen Yun made a speech on commercial work and the relationship between industry and commerce. In his speech, he analyzed the historical conditions that led to some errors and shortcomings existing in commercial work, and put forward various measures to correct these errors and shortcomings.

At today's meeting, the delegates also heard the report on the review of proposals made by Li Xuefeng, Chairman of the Proposals Examination Committee of the Third Session of the First National People's Congress.

After a fifteen-minute break, the meeting began to adopt various resolutions.

All the delegates first unanimously passed a resolution approving the 1955 national final accounts and the 1956 national budget, and agreed with the various guidelines and measures for realizing the 1956 national budget proposed by Vice Premier and Minister of Finance Li Xiannian in his report. The resolution pointed out that realizing the 1956 national budget is the common task of the people of all nationalities across the country, all democratic parties, all departments of the government, and the people's committees at all levels.

Subsequently, the meeting unanimously passed the Model Regulations for Advanced Agricultural Production Cooperatives. These regulations were proposed by the State Council and had been fully consulted and discussed by all parties in advance. The regulations summarized the new experience in the development of the agricultural cooperation movement from the primary stage to the advanced stage, and reflected the demands and aspirations of the nation's farmers to resolutely take the socialist road.

The meeting unanimously passed the resolution on the work report of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, and considered the work of the Standing Committee in the past ten months to be satisfactory.

The meeting also passed the review opinions on the proposals of this meeting.

Subsequently, the meeting passed the resolution on amending Items 4 and 5 of Section 2 of Article 25 of the Organizational Law of the People's Congresses and People's Committees at All Levels in the People's Republic of China.

Based on the proposal of the Presidium of this meeting, the meeting elected Chen Mingshu, Hua Luogeng, Zhou Shutao, Mao Yisheng, and Xie Fumin as members of the Standing Committee of the First National People's Congress; and elected Zhou Lin and Yang Wengui as members of the Nationalities Committee of the First National People's Congress.

When each resolution was passed, enthusiastic applause rang out in the venue.

At this point, all the items on the agenda of this sixteen-day meeting had been successfully completed. A total of 164 people, including the people's representatives and heads of government departments who spoke at the plenary sessions of this meeting, together with the written speech of representative Cha Yiping finally submitted to the meeting today.

At 7:10 PM, when the executive chairman announced the successful closing of the meeting, all the delegates stood up and the orchestra played the national anthem. Thunderous applause lasted for a long time.

The executive chairmen presiding over today's meeting were: Liu Shaoqi, Soong Ching Ling, Lin Boqu, Li Jishen, Luo Ronghuan, Shen Junru, Guo Moruo, Huang Yanpei, Peng Zhen, Li Weihan, Chen Shutong, and Saifudin.

A total of 1,031 delegates attended today's meeting. Heads of government departments attended the meeting as observers.

Heads of diplomatic missions, diplomatic officials, and commercial representatives from various countries stationed in China, as well as some foreign guests in Beijing, were also invited to the meeting.

    全国人民代表大会会议闭幕
    批准国家预决算，通过高级农业社示范章程
    周恩来总理和陈云副总理在闭幕会上作了重要发言
    新华社30日讯　第一届全国人民代表大会第三次会议的全部议程，已在今天下午圆满地进行完毕，会议宣告闭幕。
    国务院陈云副总理和周恩来总理，在今天的会议上，先后作了重要发言。
    周恩来总理在今天的发言中，首先代表国务院向大会表示接受代表们在大会讨论中对政府工作所进行的认真的批评。
    周总理说：“这次会议开得很好。在十二次大会上的163位发言中，除了二十八位的发言是代表政府机关报告工作外，大多数代表都就政府工作提出了很多意见，进行了认真的批评。在各个选举单位的小组会讨论中，也发挥了同样的精神。我代表国务院向大会表示接受这些批评，研究这些意见，并且愿意在实际工作中，督促各有关部门和地方，检查和纠正这些缺点和错误，改善政府各方面的工作。”
    周总理接着就代表们在发言中涉及到政府工作的几个重要问题，即关于各种体制问题、关于财政工作问题、关于职工群众生活问题、关于文教工作问题和关于反对官僚主义问题，分别作了说明和解答。
    当周总理谈到中央与地方关系这个问题的时候，他着重指出：中央与地方职权的划分，宪法上本有明文规定。现在，由于我们国家对农业、手工业和资本主义工商业的社会主义改造的胜利，生产关系已经起了根本性的变化，生产力将大大提高，为了适应这种新的情况，中央与地方的职权的划分，应该更加具体。民主集中制是我国政治制度的原则。在中央统一领导下实行中央与地方的适当的分权，是为了更能发挥地方和广大人民发展生产、加强工作的积极性和创造性，这样，就更有利于社会主义建设。这种职权的划分，具体表现在各种体制上。国务院现在正为各种体制的规定进行准备工作。
    在谈到财政工作问题的时候，周总理说，根据这次大会上代表们的意见，国务院准备在今年七月起就拟制1957年的计划控制数字和预算控制数字，以便能够及早地发到各地进行讨论。这样，1957年度的预算草案就有可能提早制定。
    周恩来总理在说明职工群众生活问题的时候着重指出，过去我们提出了“在发展生产和提高劳动生产率的基础上，改善职工群众的生活”的方针，这是正确的；反过来说，我们适当地提高职工的工资，改善职工的生活，也正是为了促进劳动生产率的进一步提高。
    接着，周总理就调整职工工资、改善职工住宅情况、合理安排职工业余时间、进一步解决职工劳动保护和医疗等问题，分别作了说明。
    关于文化、教育、卫生工作问题，周总理说，由于各方面工作的发展，大学和专科的毕业生远不够分配。他说，政府准备认真地解决这个问题。他要求国家机关和厂矿让一部分具有入学条件的年青人投考高等学校，以扩大学生的来源。
    周总理还谈到要逐步解决师资少、教室少、图书仪器少的问题；谈到改革医疗制度和改善医药经营的问题；谈到科学规划和重点建设相结合的问题。
    最后，在谈到反对官僚主义问题的时候，周总理说，许多代表对这个缺点的批评，都打中了要害。他说：一般地说，愈是上层领导机关，愈容易产生脱离群众、脱离实际的现象，也就愈容易犯官僚主义的毛病。而行政编制愈大，文件愈多，也是容易犯官僚主义的毛病的原因之一。因此，在中央领导机关工作的人员应该特别自觉，要经常注意听取来自人民群众和下级工作人员的意见，要大大地发扬民主。
    周总理强调地指出：必须改进领导方法，注重调查研究，一般指示必须与具体领导相结合，一般会议必须与典型调查相结合。要展开自上而下和自下而上的批评，为提高工作效率、反对官僚主义而进行不懈的斗争。
    陈云副总理就商业工作与工商关系问题作了发言，他在发言中分析了商业工作中存在的一些错误、缺点所产生的历史条件，并且提出了改正这些错误、缺点的各项措施。
    在今天的会议上，代表们还听了第一届全国人民代表大会第三次会议提案审查委员会主任委员李雪峰所作的关于提案的审查报告。
    会议在休息十五分钟以后，开始通过各项决议。
    全体代表首先一致通过决议，批准1955年国家决算和1956年国家预算，并且同意国务院副总理兼财政部长李先念在报告中提出的关于实现1956年国家预算的各项方针和措施。决议指出，实现1956年国家预算是全国各族人民、各民主党派、政府各部门和地方各级人民委员会的共同任务。
    接着，会议一致通过了高级农业生产合作社示范章程。这个章程是由国务院提出的，事先曾经经过各方面充分的协商和讨论。章程总结了农业合作化运动由初级阶段向高级阶段发展中的新的经验，反映了全国农民坚决走社会主义道路的要求和愿望。
    会议一致通过了关于全国人民代表大会常务委员会工作报告的决议，对常务委员会十个月来的工作认为满意。
    会议还通过了这次会议的提案审查意见。
    随后，会议通过了关于修改中华人民共和国地方各级人民代表大会和地方各级人民委员会组织法第二十五条第二款第四项第五项规定的决议。
    根据本次会议主席团的提请，会议补选了陈铭枢、华罗庚、周叔弢、茅以升、谢扶民为第一届全国人民代表大会常务委员会委员；补选周林、杨文贵为第一届全国人民代表大会民族委员会委员。
    当每项决议通过的时候，会场上都响起热烈的掌声。
    至此，历时十六天的这次会议的全部议程已经圆满地进行完毕。在本次会议的全体会议上发言的人民代表和政府部门的负责人，连同今天最后送交大会的查夷平代表的书面发言在内，共有164人。
    七时十分，当执行主席宣告会议胜利闭幕的时候，全体代表起立，乐队奏起了国歌。暴风雨般的掌声长久不息。
