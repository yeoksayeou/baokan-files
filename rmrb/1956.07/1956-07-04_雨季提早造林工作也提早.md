Xinhua News Agency, Linyi, July 3rd. With the early arrival of the rainy season, agricultural production cooperatives in the Yimeng Mountains of Shandong Province have started afforestation work ahead of schedule.

After continuous rainfall in late June, afforestation teams from agricultural production cooperatives in Sunzu and Zhangzhuang districts of Yinan County began planting trees on the mountains. Agricultural cooperatives in these two districts have already planted more than 350,000 Masson pine and Chinese cypress seedlings. Gezhuang District in Yishui County has also afforested more than 1,500 mu. Many agricultural cooperatives have planted trees on scattered terraced fields with extremely low yields to facilitate soil and water conservation. Agricultural cooperatives in Fei County and Pingyi County also plan to plant 40,000 mu of honeysuckle, which can be used for medicinal purposes, during the rainy season afforestation to increase the income of their members.

In the past six years, the Yimeng Mountains have afforested 2 million mu. According to statistics at the beginning of this year, there are still about 6 million mu of barren mountains and wasteland. Now, with the development of the agricultural collectivization movement and the fact that nearly 70% of the cooperatives have organized afforestation teams, the speed of afforestation in this mountainous area has greatly accelerated. This year, the entire mountainous area plans to afforest 1.5 million mu, of which 200,600 mu will be afforested during the rainy season.

    雨季提早造林工作也提早
    新华社临沂3日电　随着雨季的提前来临，山东省沂蒙山区的农业生产合作社提早开始了雨季造林。
    六月下旬连续降雨以后，沂蒙山区各地农业生产合作社的造林小组就开始上山植树了。沂南县孙祖、张庄两个区的农业社，现在已经植了三十五万多株马尾松和侧柏。沂水县葛庄区也已造林一千五百多亩。不少农业社在一些产量极低的零星梯田上栽了树，以利于水土保持。费县、平邑两县的农业社为了增加社员收入，还打算在雨季造林中栽种四万亩可以做药材用的金银花。
    沂蒙山区在过去六年中造林二百万亩，据今年年初统计，还有荒山、荒滩约六百万亩。现在，随着农业合作化运动的发展，和近70％的社组织了造林小组，这个山区造林的速度比过去大大加快了，今年全山区共计划造林一百五十万亩，在雨季中将造林二十万零六千亩。
