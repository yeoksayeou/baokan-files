Czechoslovakia's achievements in developing its national economy during socialist construction have created very favorable conditions for the large-scale development of its foreign trade. In 1955, Czechoslovakia's total foreign trade volume increased by nearly half compared to 1948. The development of industry and the restructuring of its structure are also reflected in foreign trade. Machine products have now become the export goods with the largest proportion in Czechoslovakia's foreign trade. In 1937, it accounted for only 7.4% of the total export value, 22.9% in 1948, and 43.5% in 1955.

Although the focus of Czechoslovakia's foreign trade will remain on socialist countries in the future (economic cooperation with socialist countries is the most important pillar of Czechoslovakia's planned economy, and trade with socialist countries accounts for 71% of our country's total foreign trade), Czechoslovakia will also strive to expand its economic ties with economically underdeveloped countries, regardless of their economic and social systems.

Czechoslovakia sympathizes with and supports the efforts of economically underdeveloped countries to consolidate their economic and political independence, to improve the living standards of their residents by implementing industrialization programs, and to develop agriculture and transportation. Czechoslovakia, an industrially developed socialist country, is willing to sincerely provide them with the greatest assistance according to the needs of economically backward countries. Many of the urgent problems faced by economically backward countries have long been successfully resolved in Czechoslovakia. Therefore, Czechoslovakia is now able to introduce its rich experience in production, technology, and organizational structure to these countries. For many years, Czechoslovakia has been supplying backward countries with high-quality machinery and equipment, sending technical personnel with rich production experience in various fields, and also receiving foreign experts to visit our enterprises to understand production and master technology.

The large-scale economic and technical assistance provided by Czechoslovakia and other countries in the socialist camp enables these countries to build an industrial foundation, and then rely on this foundation to develop their own industries. This assistance is different from the so-called technical assistance provided by capitalist countries to backward countries, which hold a negative attitude towards the industrialization of these countries.

The total trade volume between Czechoslovakia and economically backward countries increased by 65% in 1955 compared to 1954. The proportion of machinery and equipment has also increased significantly in recent years. This is a sign of Czechoslovakia's sincere help to these countries.

Among the many economically backward countries that trade with Czechoslovakia, the Near East and Middle East countries rank first in terms of long-term traditions and the scale of mutual exchange of goods. In 1955, the trade volume with these countries increased by 43% compared to 1954.

Czechoslovakia imports food and raw materials from Near East countries to supplement its own needs. In 1955-1956, Czechoslovakia imported a large amount of cotton from Egypt. In addition to cotton, Czechoslovakia also imported a large amount of lemons from Lebanon, tobacco from Turkey, phosphate from Jordan, ore and rubber from Iran, and also ordered vegetable oil, soybeans, dried fruits, nuts, and livestock from these countries.

In exchange, Czechoslovakia exports high-quality industrial products, of which machinery and equipment account for the largest proportion. As early as before the war, Czechoslovakia built six sugar factories, 184 reinforced concrete and steel bridges, fodder storage facilities, and hydroelectric power stations for Iran. Czechoslovakia also supplied Turkey and Egypt with railway carriages and locomotives, and built a sugar factory and a slaughterhouse for Afghanistan. During the post-war period, Czechoslovakian machine factories built two sugar factories and a refined sugar factory for Iran, a joint factory consisting of a sugar factory and a food factory, a glucose production factory, and a winery for Syria. It built several bridges and a water storage station for Egypt. In the past year, the Czechoslovakian enterprise "Technoexport" company, which exports basic equipment, overcame fierce international competition and accepted such a series of orders: supplying equipment to an Afghan cement factory; supplying equipment to Egyptian cement factories, pottery factories, and shoe factories; building a plywood enterprise and two cold storage facilities for Iran; building a large-scale textile factory for Turkey, and supplying it with one hundred and fifty carriages. In addition to the equipment for comprehensive factories, Czechoslovakia also supplies individual machinery and equipment, mainly diesel engines, diesel engine sets, textile factory machinery, metalworking machine tools, electric motors and other electrical equipment, transportation vehicles, especially automobiles, etc.

In recent years, trade ties with another large region of Asia—Southeast Asian countries—have also been rapidly expanding. In 1955, the total trade volume with these countries increased by 48% compared to 1954, of which exports increased by 68%. More active contacts have been developed with Burma, Indonesia, and Pakistan, and commodity exchange with Thailand is also increasing. Although the trade volume with India, Malaya, and Ceylon in the first few months of this year has not reached the level of the past few years, economic ties with these countries, especially with India, will soon be greatly expanded.

Czechoslovakia provides a stable market for many products of these countries. Czechoslovakia imports rubber, zinc, tea, coffee, mother-of-pearl, and oil cake from Indonesia, rice from Burma, iron ore, mica, shellac, and pepper from India, jute from Pakistan, raw rubber from Malaya, and tea and coconut products from Ceylon.

As for the machinery and equipment supplied by Czechoslovakia, here are a few examples: supplying complete sets of equipment for seven sugar factories in India, and supplying equipment for building several sugar factories in Burma, Thailand, and Indonesia. During the post-war period, Czechoslovakian enterprises have supplied India with equipment for building two sugar factories, a steam boiler, and a power station. Czechoslovakia supplies Indonesia with several powerful turbines for two power stations. Czechoslovakia supplies the Southeast Asian region with a large amount of machinery manufacturing equipment, such as diesel engines, diesel engine sets, oil presses, textile industry machinery, tractors (mainly exported to India), trucks, and dredgers.

Currently, Czechoslovakian factories are manufacturing two thousand and fifty carriages, fifty locomotives, a cement factory, two sugar factories, and equipment for a power station for India, equipment for a rubber shoe factory for Burma, and equipment for an enamel factory for Indonesia.

The above facts show that Czechoslovakian industrial products not only have a long tradition and a good reputation in the markets of these countries, but also that their quantity and variety are constantly increasing. When we summarize the results of the economic ties between Czechoslovakia and its trading partners, we should also emphasize the good role played by the agreements concluded between Czechoslovakia and many countries. At present, Czechoslovakia has trade agreements or payment agreements with Afghanistan, Burma, Ceylon, Egypt, India, Iran, Lebanon, Syria, Sudan, and Turkey. Among these many agreements, the long-term agreements with Afghanistan, Burma, and Egypt rank first.

In addition to the many negotiations held by the Czechoslovakian government delegations and the government representatives of various economically backward countries, there are also active contacts between businessmen and entrepreneurs. At the same time, Czechoslovakia also regularly participates in international fairs and exhibitions held in various countries around the world, and has held separate Czechoslovakian industrial exhibitions in many economically underdeveloped countries such as Iran, Egypt, India, Burma, and Lebanon.

Czechoslovakia deeply understands the needs of economically backward countries. It regards economically backward countries as its equal partners, respects their national sovereignty, and strives to support their efforts to continuously consolidate independence and develop their economy.

Czechoslovakia will continue to expand trade relations and economic and technical cooperation with all economically backward countries with all its strength. The consolidation of economic relations, friendly and selfless assistance, and the development of economic cooperation will help promote mutual understanding and trust among the people of all countries, and the common prosperity of the economies of all countries.

    捷克斯洛伐克同亚非国家的经济关系
    捷克斯洛伐克对外贸易部部长　理·德沃夏克
    捷克斯洛伐克在社会主义建设中所取得的发展国民经济的成就，为大规模发展它的对外贸易创造了非常有利的条件。1955年捷克斯洛伐克的对外贸易总额比1948年增加了近一半。工业的发展和它的结构的改组，也反映在对外贸易中。现在机器产品已成为捷克斯洛伐克对外贸易中占比重最多的出口物了。1937年它在出口总额中只占7.4％，1948年占22.9％，而在1955年已占到43.5％。
    尽管捷克斯洛伐克对外贸易的重心今后仍将放在社会主义国家方面（同社会主义国家的经济合作是捷克斯洛伐克计划经济的最重要的支柱，对社会主义国家的贸易占我国对外贸易总额的71％），但是捷克斯洛伐克也将竭力扩大它同经济不发达国家的经济联系，而不论它们的经济社会制度如何。
    经济不发达国家为巩固自己的经济和政治独立，为通过实施工业化纲领来提高本国居民的生活水平，和为发展农业和交通运输的意图和所作的努力，得到了捷克斯洛伐克的同情和支持。工业发达的社会主义国家捷克斯洛伐克，愿意根据经济落后国家的要求，诚心诚意地给予它们最大的帮助。现在经济落后的国家所面临的急需解决的许多问题，在捷克斯洛伐克早已顺利地解决了。因此，捷克斯洛伐克现在能够把自己在生产、技术和组织机构方面的丰富经验介绍给这些国家。捷克斯洛伐克许多年来就已在供给落后国家以优等质量的机器和设备，派出具有丰富生产经验的各方面的技术人员，并且还接纳外国的专家来到我国企业中了解生产情况和掌握技术。
    捷克斯洛伐克和社会主义阵营其他国家所给与的大规模的经济技术援助，使这些国家能够建设起工业基础，然后依靠这个基础来发展自己的工业。这种援助和资本主义国家对落后国家提供的所谓技术援助是不同的，它们对待这些国家的工业化问题是抱着否定的态度的。
    捷克斯洛伐克和经济落后国家之间的贸易总额1955年比1954年增加了65％。其中机器和装备所占的比重在最近几年来也大大地增加了。这就是捷克斯洛伐克真诚帮助这些国家的标志。
    在和捷克斯洛伐克进行贸易的许多经济落后国家中，从长期的传统和互相换货的规模来说，近东和中东国家占着首位。1955年对这些国家的贸易额比1954年增加了43％。
    捷克斯洛伐克从近东各国输入食品和原料以补足自己的需要。在1955——1956年，捷克斯洛伐克从埃及输入了大量的棉花。除棉花以外，捷克斯洛伐克还从黎巴嫩输入了大量的柠檬，输入了土耳其的烟草、约旦的磷酸盐、伊朗的矿石和橡胶，还向这些国家订购了植物油、大豆、干果、坚果和牲畜等。
    作为交换，捷克斯洛伐克输出优等质量的工业品，其中机器和设备占的比重最大。远在战前，捷克斯洛伐克就为伊朗建设了六个制糖工厂、184座钢筋和钢筋水泥桥、秣草保藏库和水电站等。捷克斯洛伐克也供给土耳其和埃及以铁路车厢和火车头，为阿富汗建立了一座制糖工厂和一个屠宰场。战后期间，捷克斯洛伐克机器工厂又为伊朗建立了两座制糖厂和一座精制砂糖厂，为叙利亚建立了一座由制糖工厂和食品工厂组成的联合工厂、一个生产葡萄糖的工厂和一个造酒工厂。它为埃及建立了几座桥梁和一个贮水站。在过去一年内，输出基本设备的捷克斯洛伐克的企业“技术输出”公司，战胜了激烈的国际竞争，接受了这样一系列的订货：向阿富汗水泥工厂供应设备；为埃及水泥工厂、陶器工厂和制鞋工厂供应设备；为伊朗建设一个胶合板企业和两个冷藏库；为土耳其建立一个规模宏大的纺织工厂，并供给它一百五十个车厢。除了综合工厂的设备以外，捷克斯洛伐克也供给个别的机器设备，主要是柴油发动机、柴油联动机、纺织工厂的机器、金属加工机床、电动机和其他的电动设备，运输工具，首先是汽车，等等。
    最近几年来，和亚洲的另一个很大的区域——东南亚各国的贸易联系也在迅速地扩大。1955年对这些国家的贸易总额，比1954年增加了48％，其中输出额增加了68％。和缅甸、印度尼西亚和巴基斯坦的比较活跃的联系展开了，和泰国的商品交换也在增加。虽然在今年的前几个月内同印度、马来亚和锡兰的贸易额没有达到过去几年的水平，但不久将会大大扩大同这些国家，特别是同印度的经济联系。
    捷克斯洛伐克为这些国家的许多产品提供了稳定的市场。捷克斯洛伐克从印度尼西亚输入橡胶、锌、茶叶、咖啡、珍珠母、油饼，从缅甸输入大米，从印度输入铁矿砂、云母、干漆和胡椒，从巴基斯坦输入黄麻，从马来亚输入生橡胶，从锡兰输入茶叶和椰子制品。
    至于捷克斯洛伐克所供应的机器设备，这里可以略微举出几项来：供应印度七个制糖工厂用的成套设备，供应缅甸、泰国和印度尼西亚建立几个制糖工厂的设备。战后期间，捷克斯洛伐克的企业已为印度供应了建立两个制糖工厂、一个蒸汽锅和一个发电站用的设备。捷克斯洛伐克供给印度尼西亚的设备有两个发电站用的几个威力强大的涡轮机。捷克斯洛伐克供给东南亚地区以大量的机器制造设备，如柴油机、柴油联动机、榨油机、纺织工业用的机器、拖拉机（主要对印度输出）、载重汽车和挖泥船等。
    现在，捷克斯洛伐克工厂正在为印度制造二千零五十个车厢、五十个火车头、一个水泥工厂、两个制糖工厂和一个发电站用的设备，为缅甸的胶鞋工厂制造设备，为印度尼西亚的搪瓷工厂制造设备。
    上面的事实表明：捷克斯洛伐克工业品在这些国家的市场上不仅有着悠久的传统，获得了良好的声誉，而且其数量和品种都在不断地增加。当我们对捷克斯洛伐克和它的贸易对方之间的经济联系的结果作一番总结时，也应当强调指出捷克斯洛伐克和许多国家之间所缔结的协定的良好作用。现在，捷克斯洛伐克同阿富汗、缅甸、锡兰、埃及、印度、伊朗、黎巴嫩、叙利亚、苏丹和土耳其等国都缔结有贸易协定或支付协定。在这许多协定中占首位的是同阿富汗、缅甸和埃及的长期协定。
    除了由捷克斯洛伐克政府代表团和各个经济落后国家的政府代表之间所举行的许多谈判以外，在商人和企业家之间也有着活跃的联系。同时，捷克斯洛伐克还经常参加在世界各国举行的国际博览会和展览会，并且在伊朗、埃及、印度、缅甸、黎巴嫩等许多经济不发达的国家里单独举行了捷克斯洛伐克工业展览会。
    捷克斯洛伐克深切理解到经济落后国家的需要，它把经济落后的国家看作是自己的平等伙伴，尊重它们的民族主权，努力支持它们为了不断巩固独立和发展经济所作的努力。
    捷克斯洛伐克今后仍将以全力来扩大同所有经济落后国家的贸易关系和经济——技术合作。经济关系的巩固、友好无私的援助和经济合作的发展，有助于促进各国人民的相互谅解信任，和各国经济的共同繁荣。
