    苏联帮助阿富汗修建公路和石油基地
    新华社6日讯　据塔斯社喀布尔五日讯：苏联同阿富汗在喀布尔签订了一项帮助阿富汗建筑公路的合同和一项帮助阿富汗建设三个石油基地的合同。
    关于帮助建筑公路的合同，是根据1956年3月1日缔结的关于苏联在发展阿富汗经济方面给予阿富汗技术援助的协定签订的。合同规定苏联供给阿富汗设备并且派遣苏联专家到阿富汗，为建筑通过萨兰山隘的契里卡尔—杜西公路进行勘测工作。这条公路的建筑将能够改善喀布尔同国家北部地区的联系，并且将能够大大缩短从喀布尔通过西巴尔山隘到马查里沙里夫的目前的路线。
    关于帮助建设石油基地的合同是根据苏联和阿富汗在1950年7月17日缔结的贸易支付协定签订的。这个合同也规定苏联供给阿富汗设备并且派遣苏联专家到阿富汗去。
