Xinhua News Agency, June 29th, London dispatch: Rúnarsson, leader of the Progressive Party and Social Democratic Party electoral alliance in Iceland, told a "Manchester Guardian" reporter that his party insists that U.S. troops must withdraw from Iceland, as they demanded before the election, and will continue to do so after the election.

The Progressive Party and Social Democratic Party electoral alliance has become the largest party in parliament after the Icelandic parliamentary elections on June 24th.

The "Manchester Guardian" published on June 28th said that Rúnarsson demanded the withdrawal of U.S. troops because he believes the danger of war has now subsided. Rúnarsson said that the presence of U.S. troops in Iceland is a danger to Icelandic culture. He said: "This is not a significant danger in the short term, but it is a great danger in the long term." "We never intended to have troops stationed in Iceland for a long time."

    美军必须从冰岛撤退
    据新华社29日讯　伦敦消息：冰岛进步党和社会民主党选举联盟的领袖荣纳逊对“曼彻斯特卫报”记者说，他的党坚持美军必须撤出冰岛，在选举前这样要求，在选举以后还要这样做。
    进步党和社会民主党选举联盟在六月二十四日的冰岛议会选举以后已经成为议会第一大党。
    六月二十八日的“曼彻斯特卫报”发表的访问记说，荣纳逊之所以要求美军撤退，是因为他认为战争的危险现在已经消退。”荣纳逊说，美军驻在冰岛对冰岛的文化是一种危险。他说：“这在短期内并不是什么了不起的危险，但是在长时期内却是一个很大的危险”。“我们从来也不打算让军队长期驻在冰岛。”
