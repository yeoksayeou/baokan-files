    Xinjiang Discovers Rare Early-Maturing Corn Variety
    Growing Season of Forty to Sixty Days, Can Yield Three Harvests a Year
    Urumqi Dispatch, July 6th: Two early-maturing corn varieties that yield three harvests a year have recently been discovered in the Korla Oasis of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region. These two varieties are called "Yingjisha Qilige" and "Mongolian Qilige" ("Qilige" means early-maturing). The former matures in about forty days, and the latter in about sixty days. Generally, if sown in early August after the winter wheat harvest, it can mature in mid-September. These two types of corn are about one meter tall, with two to three ears per plant, and some even have five. The ear length is about fifteen centimeters and the diameter is three centimeters. Under the local conditions of rough cultivation, each mu can yield about 200 jin. These two varieties were recently discovered by the Agricultural, Forestry and Animal Husbandry Survey Team of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region荒地勘测设计局 (wasteland survey and design bureau) during a local survey. It is estimated that these two varieties are not only suitable for widespread planting in the southern Xinjiang region, but also in the Manas River basin of northern Xinjiang and mountainous areas with short growing seasons.

    新疆发现稀有早熟玉米品种
    生长期四十到六十天，一年可以三熟
    本报乌鲁木齐6日电　在新疆维吾尔自治区的库尔勒绿洲上，最近发现了两个一年三熟的早熟玉米品种。这两个品种名字叫“英吉莎气里盖”和“蒙古气里盖”（“气里盖”即早熟的意思）。前者成熟期约为四十天，后者为六十天左右。一般如在冬小麦收割后在八月初播种，九月中旬即可成熟。这两种玉米株高一公尺左右，每株结穗二至三个，也有结五个的。穗长约十五公分，直径三公分，在当地耕作栽培粗放的情况下，每亩能收到二百斤左右。这两个品种是新疆维吾尔自治区荒地勘测设计局农林牧调查组最近在当地调查中发现的。据估计，这两个品种不仅适宜在南疆地区普遍种植，而且在北疆玛纳斯河流域和生长季节短的山区也可以种植。　　　　　　　　　　　　（新疆日报编辑部）
