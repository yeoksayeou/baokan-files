    Soviet scholars have solved the puzzle of the Mayan writing system, a challenge in the field of linguistics. The Soviet youth scholar, Yu. V. Knorozov, solved this problem. Knorozov graduated from Moscow University in 1948. His doctoral dissertation on Mayan script was awarded a doctorate in history in 1955 due to its high scientific value.

    The Mayans (ancestors of the Indians) were the creators of ancient Indian civilization. Their civilization can be compared with the ancient civilizations of Sumer and Egypt. They left behind a type of script that is difficult to decipher. This script probably originated in the oldest city-states of Central America in the first century BC. Afterwards, this script did not undergo major changes and was preserved until the Spanish invasion in the sixteenth century. The language represented by Mayan hieroglyphs is very different from the Mayan language of the colonial era. Therefore, it is very difficult to accurately translate this script.

    Scholars in Western European countries and the United States have been attempting to decipher the Mayan script for more than a hundred years, but so far have not been able to provide a satisfactory explanation of the Mayan writing system.

    Since the news of Knorozov's successful solution to the Mayan writing system spread, it is said that the United States offered him a large sum of money to go to the United States to study, but in order to dedicate all his energy to scientific research for his motherland, he refused to go abroad.

    Knorozov was able to achieve this success because his research methods differed from those of Western capitalist scholars. Knorozov's study of Mayan script was based on the Marxist scientific materialist view of social development.

    Knorozov's solution to the Mayan writing system is not only helpful for linguists, but also greatly helpful for historians and ethnologists. (Luo Zhiping)

    苏联学者解决了马雅文字系统的难题
    解释马雅文字这一个文字学上的难题在苏联解决了。解决这个难题的是苏联的青年学者尤·弗·克诺罗佐夫。克诺罗佐夫于1948年毕业于莫斯科大学。他所提出的研究马雅文字的副博士论文由于有高度的科学价值，1955年被授予历史学博士的学位。
    马雅族（印第安人的祖先）是印第安古文明的创造者。他们的文明可以同苏米尔和埃及的古文明相媲美。他们遗留下一种不易解释的文字。这种文字大概产生于公元前一世纪的中美最古的城市国家里。以后这种文字没有重大改变，一直保存到十六世纪西班牙人侵入时为止。马雅象形文字所代表的语言和殖民地时代的马雅语言有很大的区别。因而要准确地翻译这种文字是很困难的。
  　西欧各国和美国的学者企图解释马雅文字已有一百多年的时光了，但迄今还未能令人满意地说明马雅文字的系统。
    自从克诺罗佐夫胜利地解决了马雅文字系统问题的消息传开后，据说美国用重金聘请他到美国去研究，但他为了要为祖国的科学研究贡献全部精力，拒绝到外国去。
    克诺罗佐夫所以能获得这样的成就，是因为他的研究方法不同于欧美资产阶级学者的研究方法。克诺罗佐夫在研究马雅文字时是从马克思主义科学的社会发展的唯物观点出发的。
    克诺罗佐夫对于马雅文字系统的解决，不仅对语文学家有帮助，而且对历史学家和民族学家也有很大帮助。　　　　　（罗致平）
