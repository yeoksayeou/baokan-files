    Can Razor Clams in Yantai Port Be Harvested?
    Yantai Port is rich in razor clams (locally known as "xianzi clams") and sea clams, which are delicious and edible. The annual output is about 100,000 catties. However, the Yantai Port Authority prohibits people from harvesting them, arguing that the port is frequently used by many ships, and harvesting would affect navigation.
    To prevent these marine products from rotting and being lost in the water, the Yantai Aquatic Product Cultivation Farm prepared to use machines for harvesting as early as 1954. However, the Yantai Port Authority still refused, citing the reason of affecting navigation. In fact, these clams are mainly harvested in June and July each year, which is the off-season for fishing, and there are not many ships docked in the port. Moreover, mechanized operations will not affect the safety of the channel at all. On the contrary, if they are not harvested for many years, the razor clams will be squeezed to death on the seabed, the shells will increase, and the docks will be silted up, which will hinder the berthing of ships. However, after being rebuffed, the comrades at the cultivation farm adopted an attitude of "better to do less than more" and stopped paying attention to this matter.
    Why not use aquatic resources to meet the needs of the people? I hope that the Yantai Municipal People's Committee and relevant departments will negotiate to solve this problem, and instruct the aquatic product cultivation department to do a good job in the harvesting and cultivation of these clams.

### 烟台港内的浅蜊能不能采捞

    烟台港内的浅蜊能不能采捞
    烟台港内盛产浅蜊（俗名蚬子蛤）和海蜊子味道鲜美，可供食用。每年的产量约有十万斤。但是烟台港务局禁止人们采捞，理由是港内经常停泊很多船只，采捞要影响航行。
    为了不让这些海产在水里腐烂流失，烟台水产养殖场在1954年就曾经准备使用机器采捞。但是烟台港务局仍然用影响航行作理由拒绝了。其实，这些蛤类主要是每年的六、七月间采捞，正是渔业淡季，港内停泊的船只并不多，而且机械化作业根本不会影响航道的安全。相反的，如果长年不采捞，浅蜊会挤死在海底，壳皮增多，淤塞码头附近，就要防碍船支停泊。但是，养殖场的同志在碰了钉子以后，也抱着多一事不如少一事的态度，再也不管这件事情了。
    为什么不让水产资源用来满足人民的需要呢？我希望烟台市人民委员会和有关业务部门协商解决这个问题，并责成水产养殖部门作好这些蛤类的采捞和养殖工作。
