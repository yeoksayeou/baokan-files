    Guangdong Sugar Shipped Out Continuously
    This Sugarcane Season Sees an Increase of Over 50,000 Tons
    (Our Newspaper) According to reports, the 1955-1956 sugarcane crushing season in Guangdong Province has ended. The province produced a total of 421,920 tons of sugar for the state, an increase of 54,200 tons compared to the previous season. Among them, the five large state-owned factories in Shunde, Dongguan, Shitou, Jieyang, and Zini produced a total of 162,000 tons of sugar, overfulfilling the state's plan. Currently, the newly produced sugar is being shipped to all parts of the country.
    In recent years, Guangdong's sugar industry has developed greatly. By the end of 1952, sugarcane planting area, sugar production, and refining technology had all exceeded the highest levels before the Anti-Japanese War. In the 1955-1956 sugarcane crushing season, a total of fifty-five mechanized sugar factories were put into production, an increase of forty compared to the 1950-1951 sugarcane crushing season; total sugar production increased by 160% compared to 1950-1951. During this crushing season, all factories launched advanced producer movements, summarized and promoted many advanced experiences, and the daily crushing volume and sugar extraction rate of all factories were greatly improved compared to previous years.
    In order to supply more sugar to people across the country, Guangdong Province is building and expanding a number of sugar factories. It is estimated that after all projects are completed, more than 200,000 tons of sugar will be produced annually. Among the sixteen new sugar factories that have already started construction, there is a sugar factory with a daily crushing capacity of 2,000 tons jointly invested by the state and overseas Chinese, and five local state-owned sugar factories above the quota.

    广东食糖源源外运
    这一榨季增产五万多吨
    本报讯　广东省制糖工业1955—1956年度榨季已经结束。全省共为国家生产食糖四十二万一千九百二十吨，比上一个榨季增产了五万四千二百吨。其中顺德、东莞、市头、揭阳、紫坭五个国营大厂，一共生产食糖十六万二千吨，超额完成了国家的计划。目前，新产的食糖已经源源运往全国各地。
    几年来，广东的制糖工业有了很大的发展。1952年底，在种蔗面积、食糖产量和制炼技术等方面，都已经超过了抗日战争以前的最高水平。1955—1956年度榨季投入生产的机械制糖工厂共有五十五个，比1950—1951年度榨季增加了四十个；食糖总产量，比1950—1951年度增长了160％。在这个榨季中，各厂都开展了先进生产者运动，总结和推广了许多项先进经验，各厂的日榨量和出糖率都比往年大为提高。
    为了供应各地人民更多的食糖，广东省正在新建和扩建一批制糖工厂。预计全部工程完成以后，每年将多产食糖二十万吨以上。目前已经动工建筑的十六个新糖厂中，包括一个日榨量二千吨的由国家和华侨投资合办的华侨糖厂，五个限额以上的地方国营糖厂。
