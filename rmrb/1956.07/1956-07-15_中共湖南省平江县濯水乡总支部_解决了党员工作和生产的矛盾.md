The General Branch of the Communist Party of China in Zhuoshui Township, Pingjiang County, Hunan Province, is resolving the contradiction between the work and production of rural Party members. Among the 53 Party members in this township, 19 had their production affected and their income from labor days reduced due to actively engaging in work; 8 relaxed their work due to focusing on production; 6 performed poorly in both work and labor; and only 20 did well in both work and labor. It is expected that 17 out of the 53 Party members will have lower actual incomes than last year.

The root cause of this problem is mainly the flaws in the leadership methods of the various branch offices in the past. Party members held many concurrent positions, had a lot of work, and attended many meetings, leaving them with little time for production. Party member Lin Dingsheng, holding four positions concurrently, had work and meetings to attend every day, while his entire family of eleven people depended on him alone for labor. He anxiously raised the issue with the branch, saying, "If this continues, there's no way we can make a living."

In order to correct this abnormal phenomenon, the general branch of the township has comprehensively educated the Party members: from the perspective of the leaders of each branch office, they should care about the production and lives of Party members; from the perspective of the Party members themselves, they should actively complete the Party's tasks. The main method for rural Party members to complete tasks is to influence and lead the masses with their exemplary actions. Party members should actively labor, earn more work points, and increase their income. In addition, the general branch has adopted four measures: (1) Reduce the number of concurrent positions held by Party members. Party members holding two major positions should be relieved of one major position. Cultivate a new group of key personnel to share various duties. (2) Streamline meetings. It is stipulated that general meetings of all Party members should generally not be held during the day, and evening meetings should not exceed 11 p.m.; branch Party member meetings should be held once every half month, and township-wide Party member meetings should be held once a month. There should be sufficient preparation before the meeting to minimize meeting time. (3) Strengthen the collective leadership of the general branch and branches. Adopt a system of division of responsibilities among branch committee members. General issues can be conveyed in the fields to avoid delaying production. (4) The general branch and branches should meet the legitimate demands of Party members, help the few Party members with actual difficulties in their families to overcome them, and help Party members improve their working methods to closely integrate production and work.

Because the general branch promptly resolved the difficulties and problems existing among the Party members, all Party members warmly support the measures taken by the general branch.

### 中共湖南省平江县濯水乡总支部  解决了党员工作和生产的矛盾

    中共湖南省平江县濯水乡总支部
    解决了党员工作和生产的矛盾
    本报讯　中共湖南省平江县濯水乡总支部正在解决农村党员工作和生产的矛盾。这个乡的五十三名党员中，有十九个人因积极工作耽误了生产，减少了劳动日的收入；有八个人因埋头生产，放松了工作；有六个人工作和劳动都不好；只有二十个人既做好了工作，又参加了劳动。五十三个党员中，将有十七个人要比去年减少实际收入。
    产生这个问题的根源，主要是各分支部过去在领导方法上有毛病，党员兼职多，工作多，会议多，很少有时间进行生产。党员林丁生，身兼四职，每天都有工作和要参加会议，而全家十一口人都靠他一个人劳动。他着急地向支部提出：“再这样搞下去生活就没办法了。”
    这个乡的总支部为了纠正这种不正常的现象，已经在党内全面地进行了教育：从各分支部的领导来说，应该关心党员的生产和生活；从党员本身来说，应该积极完成党的任务，农村党员完成任务的主要方法是用自己的模范行动影响带动群众，党员要积极劳动，多做工分，增加收入。此外，总支并采取了四项措施：（一）减少党员的兼职。身兼两种主要职务的党员，要解除一个主要职务。培养一批新的骨干分担各项职务。（二）精减会议。规定白天一般不开全体党员会，晚上开会也不超过十一点钟；分支党员大会每半月开一次，全乡党员大会每月开一次。会前要有充分准备，尽量缩短会议时间。（三）加强总支与分支的集体领导。采取支委分工负责制，一般问题，可采取田间传达的办法，以免耽误生产。（四）总支和分支要满足党员的正当要求，帮助家庭有实际困难的少数党员克服困难，帮助党员改进工作方法，把生产和工作紧密结合起来。
    这个总支由于及时解决了党员中存在的困难问题，全体党员都热烈拥护总支所采取的措施。
