    A Spark Can Start a Prairie Fire
    A Few Short Stories Heard in Pingjiang County
    Hua Qing
    In the old revolutionary base area of Pingjiang County, Hunan Province, during the Second Revolutionary Civil War, one can still hear elderly people recounting revolutionary stories about the Party leading the people in a tenacious struggle against counter-revolutionary forces around 1930. These stories, passed down orally over time, may not be entirely accurate, but from these fragmented recollections, one can see the heroic spirit of our Party in leading the masses' struggle and the inseparable bond between the people and the revolutionary struggle. Here are a few short stories I heard in Pingjiang.
    Where Did the Guns Come From?
    From June 1926, Pingjiang County began to establish revolutionary armed forces. Later, although the revolutionary armed forces were repeatedly "suppressed" by the reactionaries, they continued to develop batch after batch. One after another, guerrilla forces transformed into the main force of the Red Army. In each period, there was still a considerable number of guerrillas in the local area.
    At that time, Pingjiang had no arsenal. Where did these guns come from?
    They were entirely seized from the enemy.
    In early 1928, the revolutionary forces were devastated by the reactionaries, leaving only a few broken guns. Coincidentally, the Hunan and Guangxi warlord troops in Pingjiang at that time began to fight each other. Therefore, local Party organizations took advantage of this opportunity to collect guns from the remnants of the warlords' troops.
    At that time, many small warlord units were in a very embarrassing situation due to mutual pursuit. They were unfamiliar with the terrain and would look for people to guide them, or grab laborers to carry guns and ammunition as they retreated. At this time, the Communist Party members in the countryside would deliberately allow the enemy to seize them as laborers. Carrying the enemy's guns and ammunition, whenever they reached a concealed place, they would carry the guns and run away quickly. Some would take advantage of the enemy's carelessness to throw guns and bullets into the ponds, and then collect them after the enemy had passed. The panicked enemy had to escape for their own lives and could not deal with these "laborers." When they encountered three or five enemy stragglers, the Communist Party members could sometimes seize a rifle with just a stone. Once, the heroic guerrilla member Qiu Xunmin, single-handedly and unarmed, captured an enemy machine gun and several rifles. The guns and ammunition abandoned by the enemy during their rout were also gradually collected by the Party organization. In less than ten days, the guerrilla forces in each district of the county were re-established, developing from a few broken guns to more than two hundred guns, becoming a strong revolutionary armed force.
    A Victory Won with Stones
    Once, our guerrilla team was active in the mountainous area around Baifudong. At that time, there were only more than two hundred members, with only fifty-odd rifles, some of which could not even be fired. The rest were spears and broadswords. This guerrilla team was newly established, and the members were all Party members and peasants who had been persecuted by the counter-revolutionaries and could not survive in their hometowns. None of them had any combat experience.
    One day, the enemy, with two battalions of troops and the local landlord armed forces of the "Household Corps," came to encircle our guerrilla team. The enemy used intense artillery fire to push the guerrilla team onto a mountain slope with no cover. Then the enemy climbed up from all sides. The situation at that time was very critical.
    At this time, a company commander of the guerrilla team saw many large stones around him. In his eagerness, he immediately gave the order to lift the stones and roll them down towards the places where there were many enemies. Led by this company, the entire guerrilla team followed suit. These "stone bullets" rolled down the mountain one after another, scattering the well-equipped reactionary armed forces. The enemy wavered and retreated, and the guerrilla team took advantage of the victory to pursue them. In this battle, they didn't use much ammunition, but relied on stones to kill and wound more than a hundred enemies, capturing more than a dozen rifles. This victory greatly boosted the confidence of the guerrilla teams in various parts of Pingjiang, and the enemy became even more afraid of the guerrillas.
    A Stone Tablet Buried for Twenty Years
    In a place called Pingshang, more than four miles outside Pingjiang City, there is a cemetery called Zhangjiafenping. There is a stone tablet here that concisely records the deeds of Zhu Zhang, a member of the Pingjiang County Party Committee of the Communist Party of China, during the First Revolutionary Civil War. Martyr Zhu Zhang was arrested in Pingjiang City by the reactionaries after the failure of the Great Revolution in 1927. He was subjected to severe torture, but remained steadfast and unyielding. He was only seventeen years old when he was killed. His body was secretly transported out of the city by his comrades and buried next to his house.
    In July 1930, the Red Army opened Pingjiang City and held a grand memorial service, attended by more than a thousand people. The County Committee at that time repaired the tomb of Martyr Zhu Zhang and erected a stone tablet.
    Soon, the Red Army withdrew from Pingjiang, and white terror descended again. Local peasants estimated that the reactionaries would come to destroy the martyr's stone tablet and tomb. They sealed the tombstone with bricks and mud, so that it would not be visible. The peasants vowed to each other that even at the risk of their lives, no one would reveal the secret of this tombstone to the reactionaries.
    This stone tablet was buried for twenty years. In July 1949, Pingjiang was liberated. The Red Army, which the Pingjiang peasants had been waiting for for twenty years, returned. On the second day of liberation, the joyful peasants pulled away the bricks and earth, allowing the tombstone that had been buried for more than twenty years to see the sun again.
    Since then, that tombstone has stood majestically in front of the tomb of Martyr Zhu Zhang. It tells future generations how the revolutionary martyrs did not hesitate to sacrifice themselves for the liberation of mankind. It also tells people how the masses of the people are inextricably linked to the revolution.
    Now, the members of the Communist Youth League and the Young Pioneers of the Pingjiang County No. 1 Junior Middle School, which is located near the tomb of Martyr Zhu Zhang, often organize visits to the martyr's tomb.

    星星之火
    在平江县听到的几个小故事
    华清
    在湖南省平江县第二次国内革命战争的老根据地里，现在，到处还可以听到老年人回忆在1930年前后党领导人民向反革命势力进行顽强斗争的革命故事。这些故事因为年代久远辗转口传，不一定是千真万确的，但从他们这些片断的回忆里，可以看出我们的党当年领导群众斗争的英雄气概和人民群众与革命斗争的血肉关系。下面，就是我在平江听到的几则小故事。
    枪从哪里来
    从1926年6月起，平江县就开始建立革命的武装。以后，虽然在反动派一次又一次的“清剿”下，革命武装仍一批又一批发展着。一支又一支的游击武装变成为红军的主力。在每一个时期，地方上还有相当数量的游击队。
    当时平江没有兵工厂，这些枪枝是从哪里来的呢？
    完全是从敌人手中夺过来的。
    1928年年初，革命势力受到反动派摧残，只剩几枝破枪。恰好，那时在平江的湘、桂系军阀部队互相火并起来。于是，各地党组织利用这个机会，从军阀的残余部队中收集枪枝。
    那时，有不少军阀的小部队因互相追击，非常狼狈。他们地形不熟就找人带路，抓夫子挑着枪枝弹药溃退。农村的共产党员们这时就故意让敌人抓去当夫子。他们挑着敌人的枪枝弹药，每当走到一个可以隐蔽的地方，就挑着枪枝飞步跑掉；有的就趁敌人不注意，把枪枝子弹丢到水塘里，等敌人过去再去收集，慌乱的敌人，那时也只得自己逃命，无法对待这些“夫子”。遇到敌人三个五个的掉了队，共产党员们有时只用一块石头，就能缴到一枝步枪。有一次英勇的游击队员丘训民，一个人赤手空拳夺取了敌人一挺机枪，几枝步枪。敌人溃败时丢下的枪枝弹药，也都被党组织陆续收集起来。不到十天，全县的各区的游击武装又建立起来了，由几枝破枪又发展到二百多枝枪。成为一支强有力的革命武装。
    用石头打了一个胜仗
    有一次，我游击队在百福洞一带山区活动，当时队员只有二百多人，武器只有五十几支步枪，其中有些还不能打了，其余就是用梭标、大刀。这个游击队成立不久，成员都是受反革命迫害、在客乡难以立足的党员和农民，大家都没有作战经验。
    一天，敌人以两个营的兵力配合“挨户团”等地主武装来包围我游击队。敌人用强烈的炮火，把游击队压到一处毫无隐蔽的山地上，接着敌人就从四面爬上来。当时的情况是非常危急的。
    这时候，游击队有一个中队长看到身边有许多大石头，他情急智生，立刻下命令，叫大家抬起石头就朝敌人人多的地方滚下去。由这个中队带头，全游击队也都照着干。这些“石弹”纷纷滚下山来，把装备精良的反动武装打得七零八落。敌人动摇了，溃退了，游击队就乘胜追击。这次战斗没费什么子弹，就靠着石头打死打伤敌人一百多人，缴获十几条步枪。这一胜利也大大提高了平江各地游击队的信心，敌人就更惧怕游击队了。一块埋了二十年的石碑
    在平江城外四里多路叫做坪上的地方，有个坟场叫张家坟坪。这里有一块石碑，扼要记载着第一次国内革命战争时期，中共平江县委的一位委员朱璋烈士的事迹。朱璋烈士是在1927年大革命失败后在平江城被反动派逮捕的。他受到严刑拷打，坚贞不屈，被杀害的时候，才十七岁。他的尸体，被同志们偷运出城，葬在他住屋的旁边。
    1930年7月，红军打开平江城，举行过一次盛大的追悼会，有一千多人参加。当时的县委会就为朱璋烈士修理了坟墓，并竖立了一块石碑。
    不久，红军从平江撤退，白色恐怖又降临了，当地农民估计到反动派是会来破坏烈士的石碑和坟墓的，他们就用砖和泥土把墓碑封砌起来，不让它露出痕迹。农民互相发誓：即使有生命危险，谁也不准向反动派透露这块墓碑的秘密。
    这块石碑，埋了二十年，到了1949年7月，平江解放了，平江农民盼望二十年的红军回来了，欢乐的农民们在解放的第二天就拉开了砖土，让这块埋藏二十多年的墓碑又见了太阳。
    那块墓碑，从此就一直雄伟地矗立在朱璋烈士墓前。它告诉后代的人们，革命先烈是怎样不惜牺牲为人类谋解放的。它也告诉人们，人民群众又是怎样和革命血肉相联。
    现在，靠近朱璋烈士墓的平江县第一初级中学的青年团员和少先队员们，还常常有组织地凭吊烈士坟墓。
