Xinhua News Agency Report: The Shandong Province Scientific Research Achievement Exhibition opened in Jinan City on June 27th.

Visitors showed great interest in viewing the exhibits related to genetic selection, improved seed breeding, crop cultivation, and plant protection, researched by Shandong Province's agricultural scientific workers. Li Ming, Director of the Shandong Provincial Institute of Agricultural Science, discovered that wheat bunt disease is mainly transmitted by a large number of pathogens mixed in soil manure. His discovery differed from previous research that believed the pathogen was transmitted by seeds. As a result of adopting different prevention and control methods based on his research, the amount of wheat yield reduction in Shandong Province due to wheat bunt disease decreased from more than 39 million jin in 1950 to more than 6 million jin in 1952.

A ground-based combined loading machine capable of replacing the physical labor of 350 people was displayed in the industrial section of the exhibition. It is a physical model initially designed by Yang Quan, a former engineer at the Shandong Mining Bureau, and later improved during use. It won first prize at the National Coal Mine Advanced Experience Technology Exhibition.

In the marine fisheries exhibits, there was a life cycle chart of seaweed drawn by the Institute of Oceanography, Chinese Academy of Sciences. The revelation of the seaweed life cycle by scientists solved a mystery that had plagued the scientific community for many years. The exhibited charts and articles also explained that a previously undiscovered new species of Eucheuma seaweed was recently discovered in the coastal areas of Shandong and Liaoning, proving that Eucheuma algae may grow and be cultivated in the coastal areas of China. This discovery by Zeng Chengkui, Deputy Director of the Institute of Oceanography, Chinese Academy of Sciences, and others, corrected the view held by some phycologists in the past that the coastal areas of China were not suitable for the growth of edible Eucheuma seaweed. The exhibited charts and objects also introduced the methods used by the Aquatic Products Experimental Institute of the Ministry of Aquatic Products to determine the migration patterns and reserves of economic fish.

Among the exhibits in the medical section, the charts and explanations of the achievements of local disease experts in researching the prevention and treatment of endemic diseases in Shandong Province—kala-azar and filariasis—were the most attractive to the audience. From 1950 to the present, Wang Zhaojun, Director of the Shandong Province Kala-azar Prevention and Treatment Institute, has led his staff in curing more kala-azar patients in Shandong Province than the total number of kala-azar patients cured nationwide in the forty years before liberation.

A total of 714 specimens, models, charts, and other items related to research achievements in the fields of science, engineering, agriculture, medicine, and social sciences were displayed at this exhibition. The exhibition is sponsored by the Preparatory Committee of the Jinan Branch of the All-China Federation of Natural Science Societies and will last for ten days.

### 山东省举办科学研究成就展览会

    山东省举办科学研究成就展览会
    据新华社讯　山东省科学研究成就展览会六月二十七日在济南市开幕。
    参观者带着很大兴趣观看了山东省农业科学工作者研究遗传选种、良种繁育、作物栽培和植物保护等方面的展品。山东省农业科学研究所所长李明，发现小麦腥黑穗病主要是由于大量病菌混在土粪中传染的，他的发现和以往认为这种病菌是由种子传染的研究结果不同。根据他的研究采取不同防治方法的结果，山东省小麦因小麦腥黑穗病减产的数量，由1950年的三千九百多万斤降到1952年的六百多万斤。
    一座能够代替三百五十人体力劳动的地面联合装车机，陈列在展览会的工业部分。它是前山东矿务局工程师杨泉最初设计，后来又在使用过程中加以改进的实物模型，曾经获得全国煤矿先进经验技术展览会的一等奖。
    在海洋水产展览品中，陈列着中国科学院海洋生物研究室绘制的一付紫菜生活史图表。科学家对紫菜生活史的揭示，解决了多年以来科学界的一个谜。展出的图表和文章还说明，最近在山东、辽宁沿海地区发现了一种从未发现过的鹿角菜科海藻的新种，证明鹿角菜科藻类可能在中国沿海地区生长和养殖。中国科学院海洋生物研究室副主任曾呈奎等人的这个发现，修正了过去有些藻类学家认为中国沿海地区不适于鹿角菜科食用海藻生长的看法。展出的图表和实物还介绍了水产部水产实验所测定经济鱼类回游情况及蕴藏量的办法。
    在医科部分的展品中，最吸引观众的是地方病学专家在研究防治山东省地方病——黑热病、丝虫病等的成就的图表和说明。从1950年到现在，山东省黑热病防治所所长王兆俊领导所属人员在山东省治好的黑热病患者，已经超过解放前四十年中全国治好黑热病患者的总和。
    这个展览会上共陈列了七百十四件有关理、工、农、医和社会科学方面研究成就的标本、模型、图表等。展览会是由中华全国自然科学专门学会联合会济南分会筹委会主办的，将展出十天。
