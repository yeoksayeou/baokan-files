Party members and non-Party cadres in Xingcheng Township, Qianxi County, Hebei Province, had a good work style and were fair in handling matters when they led farmers in running elementary agricultural producers' cooperatives in the past, and were supported by the masses. However, after transitioning to advanced cooperatives this year, some cadres developed several erroneous ideas regarding the implementation of the principle of democratic cooperative management. Deputy Director Fu Qingbai believed that the cadres of the management committee were democratically elected by all cooperative members, and each village had one or two representatives. Therefore, as long as the cooperative cadres discussed matters well, they could represent the opinions of the cooperative members in each village, without having to consult with the cooperative members again. Cooperative Director Zhao Wantong and another Deputy Director Zhao Wantian believed that it was easy to consult with cooperative members when running small cooperatives because there were fewer people and they lived close together; however, running large cooperatives with many villages and people who lived far apart, it was not easy to consult with cooperative members. Therefore, regardless of major or minor matters, a few cadres would just sit in a room and discuss them, and then have the cooperative members in each team implement them. At the end of February, when formulating the cooperative's annual production plan and labor plan, it was only Deputy Director Zhao Wantian and agricultural section chief Zhao Yushan, along with eight or nine other people, who sat in a room to make the plans. Because the cadres who made the plans did not understand the land and labor situation of the entire cooperative, the plans they made had many inappropriate and unreasonable aspects. They assigned a yield of 200 catties of grain per mu to the six mu of barren hillside that had not been cultivated for many years in the 12th production team. They planned to plant peanuts on the 80 mu of land suitable for growing corn in the 7th production team, and conversely, they planned to plant corn on the 200 mu of land suitable for growing peanuts in the 8th production team. This aroused the dissatisfaction of the cooperative members.

The Xingcheng Township General Branch Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, based on the ideological situation of the cooperative cadres, enlightened everyone to conduct self-criticism; and at the end of March, it convened the first meeting of cooperative member representatives, which resolved many problems. Representative Fu Yongyin criticized the cooperative cadres at the meeting, saying: "The cooperative's plan is to plant peanuts on land suitable for growing corn, and corn on land suitable for growing peanuts. When the cooperative members raised objections, the cadres did not check whether the plan was appropriate, but instead criticized the cooperative members for having capitalist management ideas and not wanting to plant according to the state plan." Fu Qingzhi suggested: "Including ditching waterlogged land, building dams and walls, repairing terraced fields, improving soil, and water and soil conservation in the plan would increase the total cooperative's grain production by 80,000 to 90,000 catties this year." These opinions raised by the cooperative member representatives deeply educated the cadres. Cooperative Director Zhao Wantong expressed his willingness to humbly accept the criticisms and suggestions of the representatives at the meeting, and made a self-criticism on behalf of all the cooperative cadres.

Since then, the cooperative cadres have realized the benefits of convening meetings of cooperative member representatives to solve problems, and have adhered to the system of holding regular meetings of cooperative member representatives. Since March, four meetings of cooperative member representatives have been held. Each meeting has solved many problems. For example, at the most recent meeting of cooperative member representatives, the representatives exposed and criticized extravagant waste, and also put forward many ways to save expenses. Zhen Zhifeng suggested that the cooperative buy hemp and have the cooperative members make their own ropes, which would save 350 yuan. Zhao Haikuan suggested that the sacks used by each team during the wheat harvest could be made from the outer packaging of goods from department stores, which could be sewn by female cooperative members, costing only 50 cents per bag, which would save 1.50 yuan compared to buying ready-made sacks, saving the entire cooperative 1,250 yuan. In addition, cooperative member representatives also proposed solutions to many problems that cooperative cadres could not solve.

In addition, the cooperative cadres also took responsibility for specific areas, going deep into the masses to understand their opinions. General Branch Committee member Zhang Cuiping and agricultural cooperative Deputy Director Fu Qingbai went to the 12th team and found that the cooperative members were generally dissatisfied with the captain's method of assigning work temporarily every day and staying up late to evaluate work points every night. After understanding the situation, they found that it was because the captain had no experience and did not know how to use the labor quotas stipulated by the cooperative. They spent three nights helping the team arrange farm work and teaching the captain how to use the labor quota method. After the team adopted the method of assigning work every ten days and recording work points every five days, the cooperative members no longer had to receive work assignments every morning or stay up late to evaluate work points every night, and everyone was very satisfied. Cooperative Director Zhao Wantong heard from various teams that disabled and elderly cooperative members requested to do some light farm work, so he proposed to the management committee that they buy a straw cutter for the four blind cooperative members and one cripple. The blind people used their hands to crank the wheels to cut the straw, and the cripple put the straw into the machine. In this way, the straw cut by these five people every day was not only used for the cooperative's livestock, but they could also cut straw for other villages, earning an average of 60 cents in wages per day.

Some cooperative members saw that the leadership style of the cooperative cadres had changed and that they adhered to various democratic systems, so they no longer used their brains to pay attention to the affairs of the cooperative. Some cooperative members only cared about earning work points for their own work and did not care about the cooperative's management. Cooperative member Fu Penglai often said: "There is a director above and a captain below, whoever takes the hoe and whoever sets the seedlings, we can just eat a bowl of worry-free rice." In response to these two kinds of thinking, the cooperative continuously carried out collectivist ideological education among the cooperative members, and praised and rewarded Fu Yongdong and Fu Yongyin, the cooperative members who cared about the cooperative's management, actively put forward rationalization proposals, and cherished public property. The cooperative also set up a suggestion office to specifically handle rationalization suggestions from cooperative members, with Deputy Director Fu Qingbai in charge of this work. After being educated, the cooperative members improved their ideological awareness and actively put forward rationalization suggestions. From March to now, a total of 143 rationalization suggestions from cooperative members have been received. After Zhao Yonggui's suggestion to the management committee to publicize the overproduction reward method to the cooperative members was adopted, it solved the problem of the cooperative members in the fourth team being afraid of wasting labor and unwilling to open up wasteland and dig the edges of fields, expanding the cultivated land by thirteen mu.

    众人就是圣人
    厉树仁
    河北省迁西县兴城乡的党员和非党干部，过去领导农民办初级社的时候，作风好，办事公道，受到群众拥护。可是今年转高级社以后，有些干部对实行民主办社的原则，产生了几种错误思想。副主任傅庆柏认为：管理委员会的干部，是经过全体社员民主选举出来的，哪村的人都有一个两个，有啥事情，只要社干部商量好了，就能够代表各村社员的意见，不用再和社员们商量。社主任赵万桐和另一个副主任赵万天认为：办小社人家少，居住集中，容易做到有事和社员商量；办大社，村庄多人家多，居住又分散，要做到有事和社员商量可就不容易了。因此，不论大事、小事，只是几个干部坐在屋子里一商量，就让各队社员去执行。二月底，制定社里的全年生产规划和劳动规划的时候，也只是由副主任赵万天和农业股长赵玉善等八、九个人坐在屋里规划的。因为作规划的几个干部对全社的土地、劳力情况不了解，制定的规划有很多地方不妥当、不合理。把第十二生产队的多年没有种过的六亩山坡荒地，每亩定了二百斤谷的产量，把第七生产队八十亩适宜种玉米的土地给规划成种花生，把第八生产队二百亩适宜种花生的土地却又规划成种玉米。这就引起了社员的不满。
    中共兴城乡总支委员会，根据社干部的思想情况，启发大家进行了自我批评；并且在三月底召开了第一次社员代表大会，解决了很多问题。代表傅永印在会上批评社干部说：“社里的规划要把适宜种玉米的地种花生，把适宜种花生的地种玉米，社员们提出意见，干部不检查规划是不是作的妥当，反倒批评社员有资本主义的经营思想，不愿按照国家计划种植。”傅庆芝提出建议说：“把涝地挑沟、垒坝墙、修整梯田、改良土壤和水土保持也规划在内，全社今年就能多增产八、九万斤粮食。”社员代表们提出的这些意见，使干部们受到了深刻的教育。社主任赵万桐在会上表示虚心接受代表们的批评和建议，并代表全体社干部作了检讨。
    从此，社干部体会到召开社员代表大会来解决问题的好处，坚持了定期召开社员代表大会的制度。从三月到现在，已开过了四次社员代表大会。每次会议都解决了很多问题。如最近召开的社员代表大会，代表们揭发批判了铺张浪费现象，还提出了不少节约开支的办法。甄志峰提出全社用的绳子，由社里买麻交社员自己打，这一项就能节省三百五十元。赵海宽提出：麦收各队用的口袋，可以买百货公司的货包皮，由女社员缝一下，每条只花五角钱，比买现成的麻袋每条可节省一元五角，全社能节省一千二百五十元的开支。另外，有很多社干部没办法解决的问题，社员代表也提出了解决的办法。
    另外，社干部还分片包干，深入群众，了解群众意见。总支委员张翠屏和农业社副主任傅庆柏二人到第十二队里，发现社员们普遍对队长每天临时派活和晚上评工熬夜的办法不满意。经过了解是因为队长没有经验，不知道怎样采用社里规定的劳动定额。他们就抽出三个晚上的时间帮助这个队安排了农活，教会了队长采用劳动定额的办法。这个队在采取了十天一排活、五天一记工的办法以后，社员们不用每天早晨去领活、每天晚上评工熬夜，大家都很满意。社主任赵万桐到各队听到有残疾的和孤老的社员要求给一些轻微的农活做，他便向管理委员提议，给四个失明的社员和一个瘸子买了一架铡草机，失明的人用手摇轮子铡草，瘸子往机器里入草。这样，这五个人每天铡的草除供全社的牲口食用之外，还能给外村铡草，平均每天可收入六角工钱。
    有些社员见到社干部的领导作风转变了，坚持了各种民主制度，就不再动脑筋过问社里的事情。也有的社员光顾自己干活得工分，不关心社的经营管理。社员傅朋来经常这样说：“上有社长，下有队长，谁拿锄谁定苗，咱吃碗松心饭就算了。”社里针对着这两种思想，不断地向社员们进行集体主义思想教育，并对关心社的经营管理，积极提合理化建议和爱护公共财产的社员傅永栋和傅永印进行了表扬和奖励。社内还设立了建议处，专门受理社员的合理化建议，由副主任傅庆柏负责这个工作。社员们经过教育以后，提高了思想觉悟，都积极地提合理化建议。从三月到现在，共收到社员合理化建议一百四十三件。赵永桂建议管理委员把超产奖励的办法向社员们公布的建议被采纳以后，解决了第四队社员怕费工，不愿开荒刨地边的思想，扩大了十三亩耕地。
