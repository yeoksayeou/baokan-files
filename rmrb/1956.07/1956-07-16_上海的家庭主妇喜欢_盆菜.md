Shanghai Housewives Like "Assorted Dish"

These days, many housewives in Shanghai are excitedly discussing the "assorted dish" sold at the Datong Road vegetable market. Worker's family member Lu Yunying said, "In the past, going to the vegetable market, the most troublesome thing was choosing vegetables. I often carried a basket, picking this and that, but nothing satisfied me, and I would go home empty-handed. Now it's much more convenient!"

The newly created "assorted dish" at Datong Road vegetable market has saved housewives from the distress of not being able to pick satisfactory vegetables when buying groceries. The vegetable sellers wash, chop, and dice all kinds of vegetables and meats, and put them together in a pot according to common household cooking needs. Each pot costs from five cents to several dimes. Housewives can just buy this pot of vegetables and cook it. There are many varieties of "assorted dishes," and the prices are also cheap. For example, a kind of mixed meat dish sold on the day of the Dragon Boat Festival included twelve ingredients such as pig heart, pig kidney, shrimp, sea cucumber, squid, goose pieces, pork skin, tomatoes, wood ear fungus, peas, and water bamboo. In addition, it also included a package of water chestnut flour, all for only 3 dimes.

Now, in addition to the three hundred stalls in Datong vegetable market that supply this kind of "assorted dish", thirty-seven vegetable markets in the city, including Urumqi Middle Road, are also learning this method.

    上海的家庭主妇喜欢“盆菜”
    这些天来，上海市的许多家庭主妇，在兴奋地议论着大统路菜市场卖的“盆菜”。工人家属陆云英说：“过去上菜场，最伤脑筋的是配菜，往往提着篮子择这择那，都不中意，便空着回家，现在可方便多了！”
    大统路菜市场新创造的“盆菜”，使家庭主妇们免去了买菜时难挑选到可心菜的苦恼。卖菜的人把各类蔬菜和荤菜洗净、切碎，按家庭常用的菜目拼成一盆一盆的，每盆的价格从五分到几角不等，家庭主妇把这盆菜买回去，只须下锅烧制就可以了。盆菜的花样是很多的，价钱也便宜。例如，在端午节当天出售的一种荤什锦，其中有猪心、猪腰、虾仁、海参、鱿鱼、鹅块、肉皮、番茄、木耳、豌豆、茭白等十二种原料，另外还加上一包菱粉，一共才三角钱。
    现在，供应这种“盆菜”的除大统菜市场的三百多个摊贩外，还有乌鲁木齐中路等市已有三十七个菜市场在学习这种方法。
