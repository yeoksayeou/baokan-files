Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, July 17th: The large amount of old steel materials and machinery and equipment left on Hainan Island during the War of Resistance Against Japan is now being thoroughly processed. The Hainan Area Old Steel Processing Office, organized to handle these steel materials and machinery and equipment, was established on the 14th.

For a long time, the responsible departments did not pay attention to the disposal of these steel materials and machinery and equipment. In addition to many departments having surplus discarded steel materials and machinery and equipment, in many places, damaged steel plates, rails, and various machine parts, and even complete diesel engines, could be seen everywhere in the wilderness, in the fields, on the roadside, and by the seaside. These steel and equipment were exposed to wind and rain, seawater erosion, some were buried by mud, some were covered by overgrown weeds, and some had completely become waste.

Due to the exposure by the people of this serious waste phenomenon, the Guangdong Provincial People's Committee sent a working group to Hainan Island in June to conduct a preliminary investigation. According to incomplete statistics, there are more than 20,600 tons of complete and broken steel materials on the island. In addition, there are four turbine generators ranging from 1,000 to 2,500 kilowatts, more than one hundred large and small motors and diesel engines, more than four hundred seamless steel pipes, and many other valuable equipment.

Currently, the Hainan Area Old Steel Processing Office is stepping up its work. With the exception of steel rails, the remaining old steel materials and machinery and equipment have begun to be allocated to industrial production units and basic construction sites on Hainan Island and in other parts of Guangdong Province for use. At the same time, this office has also decided to mobilize the people to collect scattered old and scrap steel materials through the purchase by supply and marketing cooperatives.

    把遗弃的物资投到建设中去
    海南岛开始彻底处理旧钢铁器材
    估计可以搜集钢铁材料二万多吨
    新华社广州17日电　抗日战争时期遗留在海南岛的大批旧钢铁材料和机器设备，现在正在进行彻底处理。为了处理这批钢铁材料和机器设备而组织的海南区旧钢铁处理办公室在14日成立。
    长期以来，主管部门没有注意处理这批钢铁材料和机器设备。除了许多部门都有多余的废置的钢铁材料、机器设备以外，许多地方，在荒郊、野岭、路旁、海滨到处可以看到正在损坏的钢板、钢轨和各种机器零件，甚至整部的柴油机。这些钢铁和器材任由风吹雨淋，海水浸蚀，有的已经被泥土埋没，有的已经被丛生的野草遮盖，还有的已经完全变成废物。
    由于人民群众对这个严重的浪费现象的揭发，广东省人民委员会在六月间派了工作组到海南岛进行了初步的调查。根据不完全的统计，岛上有完整和破烂的钢铁材料二万零六百多吨。另外，还有一千到二千五百瓩的透平发电机四部及大小马达、柴油机等一百多部，有四百多条无缝钢管和许多其他的贵重的器材。
    目前，海南区旧钢铁处理办公室正在加紧展开工作。除了钢轨以外，其余的旧钢铁材料和机器设备，已经开始调拨给海南岛和广东省其它地方的工业生产单位和基本建设工地使用。同时，这个办公室还决定通过供销合作社的收购，发动人民群众把散失的旧废钢铁材料搜集起来。
