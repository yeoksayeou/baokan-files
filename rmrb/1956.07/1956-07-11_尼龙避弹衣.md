    Nylon Bulletproof Vest
    Cultural Instructor Long Zhangshu
    A notice came to send all the prisoners to the camp. All the prisoners came out of the tunnels, except for one who refused to come out, babbling something. We patiently watched him gesticulate for a long time before we understood that he was saying: he was wearing ordinary clothes now, and there were shells exploding outside at any time, and he was afraid of being killed by the shells; he wanted to put on his "nylon bulletproof vest" so he wouldn't be afraid of the shells outside.

    Seeing this cowardly and pathetic appearance of this scaredy-cat, it was really both infuriating and funny. What to do with him? We couldn't hit him, and we couldn't scold him. After considering for a long time, we came up with a good solution. I quickly crawled into the tunnel and took out one of the captured "nylon bulletproof vests." The prisoner thought we were giving it to him and grinned as he reached for it. I stopped him and told him to watch carefully. I placed the "nylon bulletproof vest" on the edge of the tunnel, took a few steps back, pulled out a "Type 51" pistol, and aimed at it. With a "bang," it pierced right through this "armor."

    The prisoner's face turned pale instantly, and he looked at the pierced "nylon bulletproof vest" in fear, shaking his head and mumbling. I gave him the bulletproof vest, but he pushed it away, a look of bewilderment on his face, and he honestly followed the other prisoners.

    These stupid and pathetic wretches, only then did they realize that they had been deceived by their officers.

    尼龙避弹衣
    文化教员　龙章树
    有通知来，叫把俘虏都送到营里。所有的俘虏都从坑道里出来了，只有一个死也不肯往外走，哇哩哇啦地不知道说些甚么。我们耐心地看他比画了好久，才明白他是在说：他现在穿的是普通衣服，外面随时有炮弹爆炸，恐怕被炮弹打死；他想要穿上他的“尼龙避弹衣”，就不怕外面的炮弹了。
    看见这个怕死鬼的熊包相，真是叫人又好气又好笑。对他怎么办呢？又不能打，又不能骂，想给他解释解释，又讲不通话，考虑半天，才想出一个好办法。我很快地钻进坑道，把缴获的“尼龙避弹衣”取出一件来。俘虏以为送给他，嘻皮笑脸地就要来拿。我一把拦住他，叫他在旁边注意看。我把“尼龙避弹衣”摆在坑道边上，退了几步，掏出“五一”式手枪，瞄准它就是一枪。“砰”的一声，就把这件“铠甲”穿了个透眼。
    俘虏的脸一下子变得惨白，恐惧地看着打穿了的“尼龙避弹衣”，嘴里咕噜着摇了摇头。我把避弹衣给他，他用手推开，脸上露出惶惑的神情，老老实实地跟着其他俘虏走了。
    这些愚蠢的可怜虫，直到这时，才知道受了他们那些长官的欺骗。
