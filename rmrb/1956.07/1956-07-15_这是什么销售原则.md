What Kind of Sales Principle Is This?

The thread blankets and blended yarn sold by the Yidu County Department Store in Shandong Province are produced in Weixian County and are of poor quality and high price. The thread blankets and blended yarn from Qingdao are better in color and quality than the products from Weixian, and each blanket is 9 jiao cheaper, and each bundle of thread is 8 jiao cheaper. However, the Weixian Branch of the Department Store insists that the county stores under its jurisdiction sell Weixian goods, supposedly based on the sales principles of "district having district boundaries," "province having provincial boundaries," and "domestic first, then foreign."

Besides causing artificial inconvenience to consumers, what other benefits does this kind of sales "principle" have? (Gao Yan)

    这是什么销售原则
    山东省益都县百货商店销售的线毯子和合股线是潍县生产的，质次价高；青岛的线毯子和合股线色泽质量都比潍县产品好，而且每条毯子便宜九角钱，每捆线便宜八角钱。可是潍县百货分公司却偏要它管辖的县商店销售潍县货，据说这是“区有区界”、“省有省界”“先内后外”的销售原则。
    这种销售“原则”除了给消费者造成人为的不便以外，还有什么好处呢？　（高　炎）
