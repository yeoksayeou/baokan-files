    The State Council Directs Industrial Departments and the Ministry of Foreign Trade to
    Improve the Quality of Exported Industrial Products and the Supply of Goods

    (Reported by this newspaper) In recent years, China's exports of industrial products have increased year by year. Their quality is generally good, and they have been praised and welcomed by distributors and consumers in various countries. However, the quality of individual varieties is not good enough, and there are shortcomings in packaging and decoration; the supply of certain export industrial products is sometimes intermittent. In addition, business operations are not flexible enough.

    In order to effectively improve the quality and specifications of China's export industrial products and improve the supply of export industrial products, the State Council made several decisions on the work of exporting industrial products in the future on June 28. The main points of these decisions are:

    1. Each relevant industrial department should have an agency specifically responsible for export supply work, or designate a special person to manage this work, responsible for contacting the Ministry of Foreign Trade, and supervising the production and supply of export industrial products.

    2. Each relevant industrial department shall compile a production plan for export industrial products based on the export plan approved by the state, and supervise its affiliated factories to complete quantity and quality specification targets.

    3. For bulk products supplied for export, the relevant industrial departments should designate special factories or workshops to produce them according to export requirements. For products that are currently exported in small quantities and do not yet require the designation of special factories or workshops for production, production processes and finished product inspection must be strengthened to ensure that they meet export requirements.

    4. All industrial departments and the Ministry of Foreign Trade shall cooperate closely, properly arrange production and export, and actively strive to complete the plan. The Ministry of Foreign Trade shall sign agreements or contracts with various industrial departments based on the situation in foreign markets and the results of foreign negotiations. After signing the agreement or contract, the industrial department must guarantee supply in terms of quality, quantity, and time; the Ministry of Foreign Trade must accept in accordance with the quantity and conditions stipulated in the agreement or contract. The Ministry of Foreign Trade may refuse to accept products and defective products produced by industrial departments that do not comply with the provisions of the agreement or contract.

    5. All industrial departments should actively improve the quality, improve specifications, packaging, and decoration of products supplied for export, and attach scientific explanations in Chinese and foreign languages so that foreign consumers can understand their uses and usages; some exported industrial products (such as bicycles, sewing machines, etc.) should also be equipped with an appropriate amount of parts and accessories to facilitate foreign users.

    6. All industrial departments should strive to reduce production costs for products supplied for export. The domestic transfer prices of various export industrial products shall be separately formulated and resolved by the Ministry of Foreign Trade and relevant production departments in conjunction with the State Economic Commission and the Ministry of Finance.

    国务院指示工业部门和对外贸易部
    改进出口工业品的质量和货源供应
    本报讯　近年来我国工业品的出口，逐年都有增加，它的质量基本上是好的，受到各国经销者和消费者的称赞和欢迎。但是，有个别品种的质量还不够好，包装和装璜也有缺点；某些出口工业品在货源供应上有时断时续的现象。此外，在业务经营方面也还不够灵活。
    为了有效地改进我国出口工业品的质量规格，改善出口工业品的货源供应工作，国务院已在六月二十八日对于今后工业品出口工作作了几项决定。这些决定的要点是：
    一、各有关工业部门应当有专管出口供货工作的机构，或者指定专人管理这项工作，负责同对外贸易部联系，督促出口工业品的生产和供货工作。
    二、各有关工业部门应当根据国家批准的出口计划编制出口工业品的生产计划，并督促所属工厂完成数量、质量规格指标。
    三、各有关工业部门对于供应出口的大宗产品，应指定专门工厂或专门车间，按照出口的要求进行生产。对于目前出口数量不大，还不需要指定专门工厂或专门车间来生产的产品，必须加强生产工序和成品检验，以保证符合出口的要求。
    四、各工业部门和对外贸易部应当密切配合，妥善安排生产和出口，积极争取完成计划。对外贸易部应当根据国外市场情况和对外谈判的结果，同各工业部门签订协议或合同。在签订协议或合同后，工业部门必须按质、按量、按时保证供应；对外贸易部必须按照协议或合同所规定的数量和条件接受。工业部门所生产的不符合协议或合同规定的产品和残、次品，对外贸易部可以拒绝接收。
    五、各工业部门对于供应出口的产品，应当积极提高质量，改进规格、包装和装璜，并且要附中、外文科学说明，使国外消费者能够懂得它的用途和用法；有些出口的工业品（如自行车、缝纫机等）还应当配有适量的零件和配件，以便利国外的用户。
    六、各工业部门对于供应出口的产品应当力求降低生产成本。各种出口工业品的国内调拨价格，由对外贸易部和有关生产部门会同国家经济委员会、财政部另行拟定解决。
