Can This Be Called an "Patriotic" Task?
By Our Correspondent Yu Ming

On May 21st, the "Anqing Daily" of Anhui Province reported an absurd incident: Wang Xiangjun, a salesperson from the Huaining County Department Store, went to the Longquan Agricultural Cooperative to sell candy on credit. The cooperative cadres had already bought a lot, but Wang Xiangjun still complained that they were being stingy, saying, "No, other cooperatives buy several hundred yuan worth at a time. You must buy at least several thousand yuan!" The deputy director said, "Comrade, we've already bought too much, we can't afford it." A member of the work team also said, "The higher-ups want us to run the cooperative frugally and build socialism..." As soon as Wang Xiangjun heard this, he shouted, "Isn't my work also for building socialism?" In the end, he even warned the deputy director: "This is something the higher-ups want us to do. It concerns the worker-peasant alliance. You have to consider it!"

The reason for introducing the content of this report is to use a typical example to illustrate the facts. Where there is a typical example, there is of course the general situation. What is the general situation like? Since March, similar incidents have occurred in many places in Anhui Province. In some places, the commercial departments even shouted the slogan of "patriotic" credit sales. What happens if the peasants don't buy on credit? Some comrades in charge of sales said that it would be called "not cherishing state property!" The issue was raised so seriously that many cooperative cadres had to shoulder this "patriotic" task. Some cooperative cadres put aside production and took scales and abacuses to apportion candy to each household. Some cooperative members, seeing that the candy was being purchased on credit uniformly by the cooperative, did not consider whether they would pay back the money later, and bought a lot on credit. Some cooperative members thought that the things purchased on credit uniformly would be deducted from work points equally in the future, and that they would suffer if they didn't take some, so every household bought on credit. If the first credit purchase was not enough to distribute, there would be a second and third time until everyone had an equal share. In this way, many cooperative members did not even know how much their income would be this year, but had already owed a large sum for candy, cigarettes, and alcohol. The consumer goods purchased on credit by one cooperative, the Xingfu Agricultural Production Cooperative in Langxi County, amounted to more than 100,000 jin of rice, of which candy alone amounted to more than 4,800 jin, equivalent to more than 70,000 jin of rice!

Why did such a thing happen? It turns out that before the Spring Festival this year, commercial departments, supply and marketing cooperatives, and handicraft cooperatives had blindly produced a large number of non-staple foods such as candy and pastries. They believed that since the cooperative movement had reached its peak, peasants would eat a large amount of candy and pastries during the Spring Festival, and supply should be guaranteed! However, they did not expect that after collectivization, the peasants would be busy with production first, not spending money first. As a result, a large amount of non-staple foods piled up. These goods could not be sold, the sales plan could not be completed, and the longer they were stored, the more they spoiled. At this time, the Ministry of Commerce sent telegrams in February and April respectively, deploying credit sales work. As a result, the commercial departments of Anhui Province found a way to solve their own problems. The commodities that the Ministry of Commerce deployed and agreed to be sold on credit by various companies were daily-use industrial products such as bicycles, radios, first-aid kits, enamel washbasins, cups, and bamboo-shell water bottles. When they reached the province, they were combined with specific circumstances, and candies, pastries, etc. were added. Various places again combined with their local circumstances and added cigarettes, alcohol, clothing, yarn, and raincoats. Items were added at each level, expanding the scope of credit sales. Some commercial departments in some areas even included goods subject to unified purchase and sale (such as cotton cloth) in the credit sales items. In the instructions for deploying this work, the commercial departments in some areas wrote "No deteriorated goods that are harmful to people's health shall be promoted for sale," but the goods they deployed for credit sales were candies with the outer coating gradually melting, pastries that were beginning to mold, and cigarettes that were about to go bad. They said in the instructions "Peasants must not be forced to buy," but they also instructed various places to adopt the method of "contracting out by area," with special personnel responsible for conducting credit sales to peasants. In this situation, when things reached the grassroots level, there was of course only chaotic and excessive credit sales, disguised apportionment, and coercion. Although some agricultural cooperatives resolutely refused credit purchases, most agricultural cooperatives did not stop the impact of this credit sales wave.

This practice of the commercial departments has created a very bad influence among the masses. Listen to the voices of the peasants! Some cooperative members said: "Didn't the higher-ups want us to run the cooperative frugally? Why does it go out of shape when we do it?" "We lack raincoats and bamboo hats for farming, but you don't sell them on credit, but you sell these things on credit, isn't that asking us to waste money?" "You ruin things, but you want us to cherish state property. Why don't you cherish it?" "Selling on credit now and paying back after the summer harvest, that's really called sweet first, then bitter!" "Our cooperative has become an oil jar. Everyone wants to dip something in it. How can this be allowed!"

After discovering this situation, the Anhui Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China immediately stopped the commercial departments from selling non-productive goods such as candy, biscuits, and salted meat to agricultural cooperatives on credit, and ordered them to conduct self-criticism. For the items already sold on credit, it was decided: 1. The money for fruits, candies, biscuits, salted meat, etc. that have already been sold should be paid back within three to five years, and the part that has deteriorated will be exempted from payment; 2. The first-aid kits and medicines that have been sold should be returned if they have not been used, and payment should be made within three to five years if they have been used. If only part has been used and part has not been used, the unused part should be returned to the original owner; 3. Goods sold on credit in Anhui by other provinces shall also be handled in accordance with the above methods.

The credit sales instructions were initially issued by the Ministry of Commerce, and later they agreed that the General Corporation of Department Stores, the General Corporation of Medicine, the General Corporation of Knitwear and other units should add many new credit sales varieties nationwide. It was not until April 20 that the Ministry of Commerce issued an emergency instruction, requiring all localities to stop selling the varieties added by the various general corporations on credit. However, various localities had been handling credit sales for two or three months, and peasants had purchased a lot of things on credit. The Ministry of Commerce's instructions did not mention how to deal with these outstanding payments. Obviously, this problem must be solved.

    这能叫做“爱国”任务吗？
    本报记者　于明
    五月二十一日，安徽省“安庆报”报道了这样一件让人啼笑皆非的事情：怀宁县百货公司的营业员王象军，到龙泉农业社赊销糖果；社干部们已经买了不少，可是王象军还嫌他们小气，说：“不行，别的社一买就是几百元，你们最低限度也要买几千元的！”副社长说：“同志，眼前我们买得太多了，受不了。”工作组的同志也说：“上级要我们勤俭办社，建设社会主义……。”王象军一听，便大叫起来：“难道我的工作就不是为了建设社会主义？”最后，他竟对副社长下了警告：“这是上级叫办的，关系到工农联盟问题，你们可得考虑考虑啊！”
    把这篇报道的内容介绍出来，是为了用典型说明事实。有典型，当然就有一般的。一般的情况怎样呢？从三月份以后，安徽省许多地方都发生了同样的事情，有的地方的商业部门甚至喊出了“爱国”赊销的口号。农民不赊购怎么样呢？有些负责推销工作的同志就说，那叫做“不爱护国家财产！”问题提得这样严重，许多社干部只得把这份“爱国”任务担当起来。有的社干部放下生产，带着秤和算盘，挨户摊派糖果。有的社员看到糖果都由社统一赊购，就不考虑以后还钱不还钱，大赊特赊起来。有的社员认为统一赊购的东西，将来每个人都要平均扣工分，自己不要，将来会吃亏，于是家家户户都赊购起来。第一次赊购的不够分配，就来第二次、第三次，直到大家都平均分到一份为止。这样，许多社员还不知道今年的收入有多少，已经欠下了一大笔糖果和烟酒钱。郎溪县幸福农业生产合作社一个社所赊购的消费品，折成稻子合十万多斤，其中只是糖果就有四千八百多斤，合稻子七万多斤！
    为什么会出现这样的事情呢？原来在今年春节前，商业部门、供销合作社和手工业合作社，曾经盲目地大量生产糖果、糕点等副食品。他们认为，既然合作社高潮到了，农民过春节要吃大量糖果、糕点，应该保证供应！可是，他们却没有料到，农民在合作化以后，首先忙的是生产，而不是首先忙花钱。因此大量的副食品就积压起来。这些货物卖不出去，销售计划完不成，而且东西越放坏的越多。正在这个时候，商业部在二月和四月分别发来电报，布置赊购工作。于是安徽省商业部门就找到了原来解决自己问题的办法。商业部布置和同意各公司赊销的商品是自行车、收音机、保健箱、搪瓷面盆、口杯、竹壳水瓶等日用工业品。到了省里，就结合具体情况，增加了糖果、糕点等等。各地又结合本地情况，增加了烟、酒、服装、毛线、雨衣。层层增加项目，扩大赊销范围，有的地区甚至把统购统销的物资（如棉布）也包括到赊销的项目中去。有些地区的商业部门在布置这项工作的指示中，写着“不得推销有损人民健康的变质商品”的话，它们布置赊销的商品，却是些外衣日渐溶化的糖果，开始发霉的糕点，快要变味的香烟。它们在指示中说“不得强迫农民购买”，但又指示各地采取“分片包干”的办法，由专人负责向农民进行赊销。在这种情况下，事情到了基层，当然就只有乱赊、滥赊，变相摊派和强迫命令了。虽然有些农业社坚决拒绝了赊购，可是大多数的农业社却没有挡住这次赊销浪潮的冲击。
    商业部门的这种作法，在群众中造成极坏的影响。听听农民的呼声吧！有的社员说：“上级不是要我们勤俭办社吗？怎么做起来就走样了？”“我们种田缺蓑衣，少斗笠你们不赊，却赊这些东西，不是叫我们浪费吗？”“你们把东西搞坏，却要我们爱护国家财产，你们为什么不爱护呢？”“现在赊，夏收后还，那才真叫先甜后苦哩！”“我们合作社成了油罐罐了，谁来都想醮点去，这怎么得了啊！”
    中共安徽省委发现这种情况以后，马上制止商业部门再向农业社赊销糖果、饼干、咸肉等非生产用品，并且责成他们进行检讨。对已赊销出去的物品，决定：一、已推销的水果，糖果、饼干、咸肉等，应该分别在三年至五年内还钱，其中变质的部分免予付款；二、已推销的保健箱和医药用品，未用的应予退还，已用的三年至五年付款，已用一部、尚有一部未用的仍退回原主；三、外省在安徽推销的物品也按上述办法处理。
    赊销指示最初是由商业部发出的，以后他们又同意了百货总公司、医药总公司、针织品总公司等单位在全国增加了许多新的赊销品种。直到四月二十日，商业部才发了紧急指示，要各地停止赊销各总公司增加的品种。但是，各地办理赊销已达两、三个月，农民赊购的东西已经不少，对这些已赊销的欠款如何处理，商业部的指示却没有提到。显然，这个问题是必须解决的。
