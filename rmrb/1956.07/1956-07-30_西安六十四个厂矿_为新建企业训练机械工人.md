    Sixty-Four Factories and Mines in Xi'an
    Train Mechanical Workers for New Enterprises

    Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: Sixty-four industrial and mining enterprises in Xi'an are currently training more than 1,500 mechanical technicians for newly established enterprises in Shaanxi Province, covering seventy-two types of work, including lathe, fitter, and foundry. Within three months to two years, these industrial and mining enterprises will train these workers to become technical workers of levels two to five, respectively.

    The departments in charge of each enterprise are taking this training work very seriously. Larger factories have also organized training committees consisting of heads of relevant departments, workshop directors, and trade unions to formulate training plans and teaching outlines, and to sign teacher-student agreements to guarantee both teaching and learning. The No. 1 Sino-Private Joint Machinery Factory, lacking a dedicated lathe for trainees to practice on, disassembled scrapped lathes to explain the structure and performance of the lathes to the trainees, and used their spare time to teach them technology. Rice Tingzhong, a sixth-grade foundry worker at the Sino-Private Joint Zhongxing Metal Machinery Factory, systematically taught trainee Miao Chuntai from basic foundry knowledge to complex operating techniques, using practical demonstrations. Under the patient guidance of Master Rice Tingzhong, Miao Chuntai basically mastered the relatively complex water and heating pipeline casting technology in more than fifty days, and the manufactured products all met the specifications. Currently, many factories, in order to improve teaching methods and improve the quality of training for trainees, have begun to comprehensively inspect the training situation.

    西安六十四个厂矿
    为新建企业训练机械工人
    据新华社讯　西安市六十四个工矿企业，正在为陕西省新建企业训练一千五百多名机械技工，其中包括车、钳、铸等七十二个工种。在三个月到两年的时间内，这些工矿企业将分别把这些工人培养成二级到五级的技术工人。
    各企业主管部门对这一培养训练工作，都很认真负责。比较大的工厂，还组织有关科室负责人、车间主任和工会参加的培养训练委员会，制定出培养训练计划和教学大纲，并且签订师徒保教保学合同。公私合营第一机械制造厂没有专门供学员实习的车床，他们便拆卸废车床，给学员讲解车床的结构和性能，并利用工余时间给学员讲授工艺学。公私合营中兴金属机器制造厂六级铸工米庭中师傅从铸造基本知识到复杂的操作技术，以实际操作表演示范的方法，有系统地传授给学员苗春泰。在米庭中师傅耐心培养之下，苗春泰在五十多天内，就基本上掌握了比较复杂的水暖管道铸造技术，制造的产品都合乎规格。目前不少工厂，为了改进教学方法，提高培训学员质量，已经着手全面检查培训情况。
