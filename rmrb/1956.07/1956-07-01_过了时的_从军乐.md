	Outdated "Joy of Enlistment"
	Huang Gang (text), Hua Junwu (drawing)

	American youth are extremely weary of life in their military.

	According to a recent report in "U.S. News & World Report," the prestigious West Point Military Academy in the United States is experiencing a slump—the 1956 West Point recruitment drive resulted in 259 unfilled slots. American military authorities are very anxious about this and are preparing to launch a major recruitment campaign using radio and television programs to fill these vacancies.

	It is no accident that some American generals have fantasized about "replacing soldiers with pushbuttons." These admirers of atomic weapons once wanted to use machines to replace the army in warfare. This shows their aggressive fanaticism, but also reflects the difficulties the U.S. military faces in expanding its forces: people are increasingly unwilling to enlist.

	Despite the fact that American television actresses continue to use seductive figures and tones to perform those "expedition overseas" advertising programs, despite the fact that radio stations are constantly repeating that special broadcast in soundproof studios that "American soldiers travel the world without spending a cent," and even though some American jewelry stores cater to the warmongering sentiments by displaying earrings made in the form of atomic bombs in their windows, American youth are increasingly recognizing the deception of war propagandists regarding people's fate—when they urgently need to fight for the right to a life free from hunger and fear at home, how can they be interested in overseas military camps far from home and the distant tombstones of the battlefield?

	It is worth noting that the majority of the West Point Military Academy's cadet quotas have historically been selected by state officials. The freshman quotas at West Point also include several cadets recommended by past U.S. vice presidents. In the past, the West Point Military Academy recruitment was truly bustling, with carriages and horses filling the streets. And ruthless generals like Ridgway, Van Fleet, and Bradley were all cultivated in the classrooms of West Point Military Academy. Now, truly "good times don't last": due to the growth of peace-loving forces both domestically and internationally in the United States, West Point Military Academy, which is renowned for training professional officers, is experiencing a cold and desolate recruitment season.

	Can one say that there is no tremendous change in the situation?

	American youth all know that when each of them joins the ranks of the U.S. military, the U.S. Department of Defense usually presents those recruits with a booklet with the word "Congratulations" on it. The "congratulatory message" on the first page of this booklet reads: the American army "will teach you to become a ruthless and skilled killer." Now, the sluggish recruitment at West Point vividly illustrates the ideological awakening of the American people—fewer and fewer American youth are willing to be "a ruthless and skilled killer."

	Let's see how the generals in the Pentagon rack their brains to fill West Point's vacancies today!

	West Point's slump shows that the blood-stained American officer profession is no longer an enviable job!

	The fundamental change today is that the forces of peace resisting war can manifest their material strength in many ways.

	This has led to the increasing bankruptcy of the "Joy of Enlistment" lies that the American authorities have propagated domestically for many years. People are rejecting the traps laid by war criminals for them from every angle. (Attached picture)

	The End

    过了时的“从军乐”
    黄钢文　华君武图
    美国的青年们对于他们军队的生活是十分厌倦了。
    据“美国新闻与世界报道”最近的消息：在美国最负盛名的西点军校如今在闹不景气——1956年度西点招生时竟出现了259名空额；美国的军事负责机关为这事非常着急，正准备用广播与电视节目来大事号召，想填满这些空额。
    不是偶然的，美国的将军们中间曾有人奢谈过“用电钮来代替士兵”的空想。这些崇拜原子武器的人们曾经想以机器来代替陆军进行战争。这说明他们具有侵略的狂热，但也反映了美国军队扩军时的困难：人们已经不愿意再去从军。
    尽管美国的电视女演员天天还在用诱惑的身段和语调表演那“远征海外”的广告节目，尽管电台隔音室里时时还在重复那“美国军人周游世界、可以不花半文钱”的特别广播，还尽管连美国有些珠宝店铺都迎合了好战分子的心意，把仿照原子弹形式而做成的耳环陈列在橱窗里，但是，美国青年人却越来越认清了战争鼓吹者对于人们命运的愚弄——当他们急需在国内争取免于饥饿与恐惧的生存权利的时候，怎样会对那远离家乡的海外军营和遥远战场上的十字墓碑发生兴趣呢？
    值得注意的是：美国西点陆军军官学校学员的名额，大部分历来都是由各州的官方所选派的；西点的新生名额中还包括由历届美国副总统所推荐的数名学员；以往每年西点军校招生时那真是门庭若市，车马如龙；而李奇微、范佛里特、布莱德雷等等杀人不眨眼的将军们就都是在西点军校的课堂里培育出来的；现在，那真是“好景不长”：由于美国国内外爱好和平力量的增长，以培养职业军官而声名显赫的西点军校，竟在招生时冷冷清清、门可罗雀了。
    还能说情况没有绝大的变化么？
    美国青年们都知道：他们当中每一个人走进美国军队行列的时候，美国国防部照例会赠送那些新兵们一本题有“祝贺”词句的小册子，这册子上第一页的“贺词”写道：美国的军队“它将教会你成为一个无情的熟练的杀人者”；现在，西点军校招生冷落的情况却突出地说明了美国人民的思想觉悟——愿意去做“一个无情的熟练的杀人者”的美国青年人是越来越少了。
    且看看五角大楼里的将军们怎样焦头烂额地去填满西点今天的空额吧！
    西点的不景气，说明那沾染血腥气味的美国军官职业再不是人们所羡慕的差使了！
    今天的根本变化就是：抗拒战争的和平势力已能从多方面表现出它们的物质力量。
    这就促使得美国当局多年来在国内所宣传的“从军乐”谎言愈加破产。人们从任何一个角度都在拒绝那战争犯子为他们所铺设的陷阱。（附图片）
    完蛋
