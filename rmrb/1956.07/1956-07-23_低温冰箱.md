    Low-Temperature Refrigerator
    (Report from our Shanghai office) The first domestically produced low-temperature refrigerator has been successfully trial-produced at the Shanghai Joint State-Private 雷电 (Leidian) Refrigerator Factory. Initial tests show that this low-temperature refrigerator reaches a coldness of minus 55 degrees Celsius, which is 40 degrees lower than ordinary electric refrigerators. Its quality has reached international standards, while its cost is only one-seventh of imported products.
    Low-temperature refrigerators are very useful in industrial production and scientific research. For example, to determine the thermal expansion and contraction of a substance, it is necessary to rely on low-temperature refrigerators; steel can be quenched at low temperatures so that it will never bend; organic glass for aerospace engineering must also be treated at low temperatures using low-temperature refrigerators; a type of bacteria used in medicine can be stored in a low-temperature refrigerator for a certain period of time and will not die within six years.
    Now, this factory has begun to produce low-temperature refrigerators in batches.

    低温冰箱
    本报上海电　第一只国产低温冰箱，已经在上海公私合营雷电冰箱厂试制成功。经过初步试用，这只低温冰箱的冷度达到摄氏零下五十五度，比普通电气冰箱低四十度。质量已经达到国际水平，而造价只及进口货的七分之一。
    低温冰箱在工业生产、科学研究方面都很有用。如鉴定某一物质的热涨冷缩程度，就必须靠低温冰箱来进行；钢铁在低温处理下淬火，可以永不弯曲；航空工程用的有机玻璃，也要用低温冰箱进行低温处理；有一种医药上用的菌类，在低温冰箱里保藏一定的时间以后，可以在六年内不死亡。
    现在，这个工厂已经开始成批生产低温冰箱。
