Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, July 6th. Newly established institutions in Yunnan Province, including Kunming Medical College, Kunming Geological School, Kunming Aviation Industry School, and Kunming No. 1 Industrial School, are receiving applications from students of all ethnic groups from all over Yunnan.
