Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou. After the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway was laid to Yumen, thousands of tons of steel, cement, and lumber urgently needed for the construction of the petroleum base have been directly transported to the Yumen Oil Mine by train. In recent days, a train fully loaded with crude oil has also been leaving the oil mining area every day.

With the train directly reaching the Yumen Oil Mine area, a large number of trucks originally running between Yumen and Qingshui have gradually stopped operating and are being prepared to be transferred to the Qaidam Basin and other places to support new petroleum exploration areas. Train transportation costs are much lower than truck transportation, saving the country tens of thousands of yuan in transportation costs in the past month.

When the railway was first laid to Yumen, there were still many transportation facilities that could not be built in time. In order to support the construction of the Yumen Oil Mine and ensure the eastward transportation of crude oil, the railway workers overcame many difficulties and quickly built temporary water supply equipment and temporary station buildings, so that on the fourth day after the railway was laid to the Yumen Oil Mine, they began to transport materials for the oil mine.

    几千吨钢材水泥和木料
    直接由火车运到玉门油矿
    新华社兰州电　兰新铁路铺轨到玉门以后，已经有几千吨建设石油基地急需的钢材、水泥和木料直接通过火车运到了玉门油矿。这些天来，每天还从油矿区开出一趟满载原油的列车。
    火车直接通到玉门油矿区，使原来奔驶在玉门—清水间的大批汽车已经陆续停止行驶，准备抽调到柴达木盆地等地，支援新的石油探区。火车运费比汽车低廉得多，一个月来为国家节省的运费就有好几十万元。
    铁路刚铺到玉门的时候，还有好多运输设备来不及修筑起来。为了支援玉门油矿建设，保证原油东运，铁路工人接着克服许多困难，迅速修起了临时给水设备和临时站场房屋等，使铁路铺轨到玉门油矿的第四天，就开始为油矿运输材料。
