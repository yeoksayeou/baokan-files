    Why Has the "People No. 12" Vessel Been Delayed for Overhaul?
    The "People No. 12" vessel, belonging to the Shanghai Branch of the Yangtze River Shipping Bureau, is a 1,000-ton cargo ship that travels between Shanghai and Hankou. This vessel has been in use for over fifty years, and due to poor maintenance before liberation, many critical parts can no longer guarantee safe navigation. In the second quarter of 1955, relevant departments decided that the "People No. 12" vessel would undergo a major overhaul at the Shanghai Shipyard in early March of this year. However, the Shanghai Shipyard postponed the overhaul time twice, at the end of last year and in late April this year. We felt that the postponement was too long, so we consulted with the Shanghai Branch of the Yangtze River Shipping Bureau and transferred the overhaul task to the Shanghai Zhonghua Shipyard. The Shanghai Shipyard also agreed and promised to transfer the materials to the Zhonghua Shipyard. However, on June 19th, the Shanghai Shipyard suddenly disagreed with transferring the ship repair materials to the Zhonghua Shipyard. Because the Zhonghua Shipyard accepted the repair task on short notice, it could not obtain steel and other ship repair materials, which resulted in us having to suspend operations. The "People No. 12" vessel makes five round trips per month, carrying 5,000 tons of cargo. This suspension of operations is a great loss to the national transportation effort.

    人民十二号轮为何迟迟不能大修
    长江航运局上海分局所属的人民十二号轮，是往返上海、汉口之间的一千吨级的货轮。这艘货轮已经使用了五十多年，加上解放前保养得不好，现在许多要害部分已经不能保证安全航行。1955年第二季度，有关部门决定十二号轮在今年三月上旬由上海船舶修造厂进行大修。但是，上海船舶修造厂在去年年底和今年四月下旬，两次提出要推迟十二号轮的大修时间。我们感到推迟的时间太远了，就同长江航运局上海分局商洽，把大修任务移交给上海中华船厂。上海船舶修造厂也同意了，并且答应把材料也移交给中华船厂。但是到六月十九日，上海船舶修造厂忽然又不同意将修船材料转给中华船厂。中华船厂因为临时接受修理任务，领不到钢铁等修船材料，结果害得我们只好停航。十二号轮每月往返五个航次，可载货五千吨。这一停航，对于国家运输工作是个很大的损失。
