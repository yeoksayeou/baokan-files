    Reading "Poems About the Fields"
    Tao Yang
    Mr. Xuan Zhu criticized the practice of applying the same label to all writers who have not written good recent works, and I think the criticism is correct. He also pointed out that Tian Jian has not had a satisfactory form in recent years, and is therefore experiencing a creative "crisis," which is also correct. However, when Mr. Xuan Zhu talked about Tian Jian's works during the War of Resistance Against Japan, he said:
      "Tian Jian's works during the War of Resistance Against Japan achieved consistency in content and form, which
  is the rhythm and angry emotion that Wen Yiduo called 'drum sound'. This poetic form,
  there is no need to avoid mentioning, is a bit of imitation of Mayakovsky. However, because the Russian and Chinese writing structures
  are very different, there is no need to avoid mentioning that this imitation is very far-fetched, and sometimes even a
  bit ridiculous."
    This statement, I think, is not entirely appropriate. Since Mr. Xuan Zhu admits that Tian Jian's poems during the War of Resistance Against Japan are consistent in content and form, and also admits that they are the sound of war drums, isn't that very good? How can it be said to be "very far-fetched" and "ridiculous"?
    During the War of Resistance, in that angry, combative era, it was appropriate for poets to adopt a form with rapid melodies and rhythms to express passionate and慷慨 thoughts and feelings. We can quote a short poem by Tian Jian to illustrate this point:
      Sorrowful
      race, we must fight!
      Outside the September window,
      on the Asian
      fields,
      freedom...
      From the other side of blood,
      from the other side of brothers' corpses,
      it comes to us,
      like a storm,
      like a petrel.
          ("Freedom Comes to Us")
    There are many people who imitate Mayakovsky, but few people surpass Tian Jian in artistic perfection. The reason is that Tian Jian did not mechanically take Mayakovsky's "coat" and force it onto his own works, but rather that the conception of his poems and his fervent passion were suitable for expressing with this clear form. It is precisely because Tian Jian creatively absorbed the advantages of Mayakovsky's poetic form that his poems have this fresh, vigorous and unique style. When we read "To the Combatants" and other works, it always seems as if we hear the roar of storms and the sound of war drums, which will immediately arouse our emotional resonance.
    Tian Jian's creative "crisis" in recent years, in addition to the lack of a fulfilling life, may be precisely because he has lost the form that he was once relatively comfortable with? Why can't he write exciting works? Why, as Mr. Xuan Zhu said, is he "unable to express himself freely"? This is worth the poet's consideration. In recent years, Tian Jian has had a tendency to simply pursue the "folk song style." There is nothing wrong with trying out certain forms, but if it is only for the sake of pursuing the "folk song style," then there is no need, because simply pursuing a certain "style" will not necessarily make the work have a Chinese flavor and national characteristics. Regarding the issue of poetic form, I very much agree with Ai Qing's "let a hundred flowers bloom" theory. If you do not gradually improve and enhance on the basis of your own skilled form, so as to find the most "comfortable" form, but completely abandon it and blindly pursue a certain "style," there will be no good results.
    Therefore, Mr. Xuan Zhu's praise for Tian Jian's self-awareness in discarding the so-called "coat" may make the poet abandon all of his relatively skilled forms, which may not be appropriate!
    I would suggest that the poet Tian Jian use his relatively skilled and comfortable form to write some poems, and people are very willing to listen to the passionate socialist "drum sound"!

    Editor's Note: After we published Mr. Xuan Zhu's "On Tian Jian's Poems," we successively received letters and manuscripts from thirty-two readers. Some agreed with the views in this article, and others disagreed, believing that the poet's main problem was "detachment from real life and a decrease in political enthusiasm." Originally, this was an issue that could continue to be discussed. The content and form of a work are two closely related aspects. However, this requires a specific analysis of the work, which cannot be resolved in a short article. Due to the limited space of the supplement, we can only publish the above article expressing dissenting opinions. We will not answer the readers' opinions one by one. We believe that Mr. Xuan Zhu's article only opposes the kind of literary criticism that indiscriminately applies the same label without asking about the specific situation. The quotation of the famous saying that each unhappy family has its own reasons is very insightful. The task he proposed that poets have one more task than prose writers, namely the creation of poetic form, is probably difficult for anyone to deny; and the view that poetry does not need to have a poetic form may not be accepted by the majority of people. Of course, this kind of creative issue cannot be unilaterally concluded by an editorial department. We will still publish discussion articles that are suitable for the supplement. As for longer articles, we can also consider publishing them on other pages.

### 读“关于田间的诗”

    读“关于田间的诗”
    陶阳
    玄珠先生批评了对一切没有写好近作的作家身上贴同一个标签的办法，我觉得是批评得正确的。他还指出田间近年来没有得心应手的形式，因而经历着创作上的“危机”，这也是对的。但玄珠先生在谈及田间在抗战时期的作品时说：
      “田间在抗战时期的作品，内容和形式是取得一致的，这就
  是闻一多称之为‘鼓声’那样的节奏和愤怒的情绪。这种诗的形
  式，不必讳言，有点模仿马雅可夫斯基。然而因为俄、汉文字构
  造的大不相同，勿庸讳言，这种模仿是十分牵强的，有时甚至有
  点可笑。”
    这个说法，我以为是不尽妥当的。玄珠先生既然承认田间在抗战时期的诗，内容和形式是一致的，也承认是战鼓的声音，这不是很好吗？怎么又说是“十分牵强的”而又“可笑”呢？
    在抗战期间那种愤怒的、战斗的时代，诗人采用那种具有急促的旋律和节奏的形式，表现激昂慷慨的思想感情，还是相应的。我们可以引用田间的一首短诗，说明这个问题：
      悲哀的
      种族，我们必须战争呵！
      九月的窗外，
      亚细亚的
      田野上，
      自由呵……
      从血底那边，
      从兄弟尸骸底那边，
      向我们来了，
      像暴风雨，
      像海燕。
          （“自由，向我们来了”）
    模仿马雅可夫斯基的大有人在，但在艺术的完美上很少有人超过田间。原因是田间并非机械地拿了马雅可夫斯基的“外套”硬披在自己作品上的，而是他的诗的构思和他的狂热的激情，适宜于用这种明快的形式来表达。正因为田间是创造性地汲取了马雅可夫斯基诗的形式的优点，他的诗才具有了这种清新、刚健的独特的风格。当我们读“给战斗者”等作品的时候，总好像听到狂风暴雨的呼啸和敲打战鼓的声音，它会立刻引起我们感情的共鸣。
    田间近年来在创作上的“危机”，除了生活不够充实以外，也许恰巧就是丢掉了曾经是他比较得心应手的形式的缘故吧？究竟为什么写不出激动人心的作品了呢？为什么正如玄珠先生所说的那样“格格不能畅吐”了呢？这是值得诗人考虑考虑的。近几年来，田间有单纯追求“民歌体”的倾向。作某些形式的尝试，这本无不可，但如果只是为了追求“民歌体”，那就大可不必，因为只追求什么“体”，也不见得就会使作品具有中国气派和民族色彩。关于诗的形式问题，我很同意艾青的“百花齐放”论。如果不在自己熟练的形式的基础上逐步改进、提高，从而找到最“得心应手”的形式，而是完全抛开它，一味追求什么“体”，那是不会有什么好结果的。
    因此，玄珠先生称赞田间丢了所谓“外套”的自知之明，就可能更使得诗人将自己比较熟练的形式全部抛弃，这也不见得妥当吧！
    我倒建议诗人田间运用自己比较熟练和比较得心应手的形式写一些诗，激情的社会主义的“鼓声”，人们也是十分愿意听的呢？
    编者按：我们发表了玄珠先生的“关于田间的诗”后，陆续收到了三十二位读者的信和稿件，有些同意这篇文章的看法，也有的表示不同意，认为诗人的主要问题还是在“脱离实际生活，政治热情减弱”这一方面。本来这是一个可以继续讨论下去的问题，作品的内容和形式原是两个密切联系的方面。但这是需要对作品作具体分析，而不是一篇短文所能解决的问题。由于副刊篇幅关系，我们只能选登上面这一篇表示不同意见的文章。对读者的意见我们不再一一答复了。我们认为玄珠先生的文章所反对的只是那种不问具体情由一概贴上同样标签的文艺批评罢了。每个不幸的家庭各有其原因的名言的引用，是很有见地的。他所提出的诗人比散文家多一重任务，即是诗的形式的创造问题，恐怕谁都难以否认；而那种认为诗无须具有诗的形式的看法，则未必能为多数人所能承认吧。当然，这一类创作上的问题不是一个编辑部所能独断地作结论的。有适宜于副刊登的讨论文章，我们还是要登。至于篇幅较长的，也可以考虑登在其他版上。
