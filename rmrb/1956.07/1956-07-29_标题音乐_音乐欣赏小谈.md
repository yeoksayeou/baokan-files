    Program Music
    --A Brief Discussion of Music Appreciation
    Chen Feng

    Recently, musical performances in Beijing have increased, and instrumental performances have gradually aroused the interest of the general public. Tickets for "Symphony Concerts" and "Chamber Music Concerts" are often sold out within one or two hours after the advertisement is published. Orchestral and solo programs are also often replayed several times at the enthusiastic request of the audience. After each concert, the audience's enthusiastic applause deeply moves comrades engaged in musical work.

    Generally speaking, appreciating instrumental music is more difficult than appreciating songs. Instrumental music, unlike songs, does not have lyrics that make it easy for people to understand. However, if you gradually understand the knowledge about instrumental music, then you will be fascinated by it.

    Instrumental music can be divided into two categories. One category has titles, called "program music." This is a type of instrumental music with specific content or plot. Such as Xian Xinghai's "National Liberation Symphony", Li Huanzhi's "Spring Festival Suite", Ma Ke's "Shaanxi Northern Shaanxi Suite", etc. The other category has no title and is named according to the genre of the music, such as Ma Sicong's "First Symphony" and "Rondo", etc. Although this type of music has no title, it also expresses certain emotions.

    Large suites or symphonies sometimes have separate titles for each movement in addition to the overall title. For example, Ma Sicong's "Song of the Forest" is composed of five movements, and the titles of each movement are: 1. "Call of the Forest", 2. "Over the Mountain", 3. "Love Song", 4. "Dance", 5. "Nocturne". Having subtitles makes it easier for the audience to understand the true meaning of the music.

    Some program music depicts certain stories and plots, such as Tchaikovsky's "1812 Overture", the content of which expresses the story of the Russian people's heroic resistance to Napoleon's invasion in 1812. In this type of program music, some inserts recitations. Prokofiev's symphonic fairy tale "Peter and the Wolf", which was recently performed in Beijing, uses the combination of music and recitation to narrate the story of how the brave Young Pioneer Peter and the clever little bird cleverly captured the annoying big gray wolf. In front of the main song, the reciter introduces the music of the characters in the story, such as the little bird, the duck, the black cat, the old grandfather, Peter, and the big gray wolf, to everyone, so that the audience has a preliminary impression of the music representing various people and animals before the performance. In this way, even children can easily understand the content of the music and appreciate it.

    Some program music does not necessarily describe any specific content or plot, but only expresses the emotions or general scenery contained in the title. Like He Luting's "The Cowherd's Flute", it only depicts the artistic conception of the cowherd singing heartily in the mountains and fields.

    "The Cowherd's Flute" is widely spread in our country and is also one of the better piano works. This piece of music is divided into three sections. The first section is in C major, a beautiful moderato, depicting the crisp and soft flute sound of the cowherd. The second section is a fast passage in G major, which sounds like the cowherd is happily playing a fast shepherd's flute in a jubilant dance. The third section returns to the music of the first section, and the melody is more gorgeous. The advantage of this song lies in its creative use of musical language with national characteristics, which better expresses the happy mood of the cowherd; the melody is kind and smooth, and the structure is tight, so it has won the love of the general public and has been praised by many foreign pianists, and it is often listed as a program of their concerts.

    Some instrumental music expresses complex and profound content and major themes, such as Beethoven's "Heroic Symphony", "Fate Symphony", Xian Xinghai's "National Liberation Symphony", etc. Some just describe a pleasant sentiment, which is also what we need in life. Like "The Cowherd's Flute", its lively, fresh, and beautiful melody can also give people joy and forward vitality.

    标题音乐 
    ——音乐欣赏小谈
    陈枫
    近来北京的音乐演出活动增加了，器乐的演出也渐渐引起了广大群众的兴趣。“交响乐会”、“室内音乐会”的票，常常在广告登出后一两个钟头内就卖光了。管弦乐和独奏节目，也常常在听众的热情要求下重奏几次。每次音乐会结束之后，听众的狂热的掌声都使从事音乐工作的同志深深激动。
    一般说来，欣赏器乐曲要比欣赏歌曲困难一些。器乐曲不像歌曲那样有歌词便于人们理解。但是，如果逐步了解了有关器乐曲的知识，那末，欣赏起来也会入迷的。
    器乐曲可以分为两类。一类是有题目的，叫“标题音乐”。这是一种有特定内容或情节的器乐曲。如冼星海的“民族解放交响乐”、李焕之的“春节组曲”、马可的“陕北组曲”等。一类是没有标题，根据乐曲的体裁取名的，如马思聪的“第一交响曲”和“回旋曲”等。这类乐曲，虽然没有标题，但是也表现了一定的情感。
    大的组曲或交响曲，有时候在总的题目之外，每章又另有标题。例如马思聪的“山林之歌”，它是由五个乐曲组成的，各曲的标题是：一、“山林的呼唤”，二、“过山”，三、“恋歌”，四、“舞曲”，五、“夜曲”。有了小标题，就使听众更容易领会乐曲的真意。
    标题音乐中有的是描写一定的故事和情节的，如柴可夫斯基的“1812序曲”，它的内容就是表现1812年俄国人民英勇反抗拿破仑侵略的故事。这类标题音乐中，有的插入朗诵。最近在北京演出的普罗科菲耶夫的交响童话曲“彼得与狼”，就是通过音乐和朗诵的配合，叙述勇敢的少年先锋队员彼得和聪明的小鸟机智地捕获了讨厌的大灰狼的故事。在正曲前面，朗诵者把故事里的人物——如小鸟、鸭子、黑猫、老爷爷、彼得、大灰狼等的音乐，一一向大家介绍，使听众在演奏之前，对曲内代表各种人和动物的音乐有初步的印象。这样，就是孩子们也会很容易地了解乐曲的内容，加以欣赏了。
    有些标题音乐，不一定描写什么具体的内容和情节，仅仅表现标题所包含的情绪或大概的画景。像贺绿汀的“牧童短笛”，就只是刻划牧童在山野里纵情欢唱的意境的。
      “牧童短笛”在我国流传很广，也是钢琴曲中较好的作品之一。这个乐曲共分三段，第一段是C调，优美的中板，描写牧童清脆轻柔的笛音。第二段是G调的快速乐段，听起来好像牧童兴高彩烈地吹奏急速的牧笛在欢舞。第三段又回到第一段的音乐，旋律则更加华丽了。这首曲子的优点，在于创造性地采用了带有民族特色的音乐语言，较好地表现了牧童愉快的心情；旋律亲切、流畅，结构严紧，因此获得了广大群众的喜爱，并且为好些外国钢琴家所赞许，常常列作他们音乐会的节目。
    有的器乐曲表现了复杂深刻的内容和重大的主题，像贝多芬的“英雄交响曲”、“命运交响曲”，冼星海的“民族解放交响乐”等就是。有些却只是描述一种愉悦的情趣，这也是我们生活中所需要的。像“牧童短笛”，它那活泼、清新、优美的曲调，也能给人们欢乐、向前的活力。
