This newspaper Taiyuan dispatch: Recently, a group of new engineers has emerged in factories and mining enterprises in Taiyuan. They were all promoted from technicians to engineers not long ago. According to statistics from only ten enterprises, the number of newly promoted engineers in the first five months of this year has exceeded the number of original engineers. The Taiyuan Power Supply Bureau originally had nine engineers, and twenty-five new engineers were promoted in the first half of this year. Some units have even promoted people with outstanding skills beyond their grade.

This is one of the concrete manifestations of Taiyuan's factories and mining enterprises actively implementing the Party's policy towards intellectuals. The Party organizations of the enterprises not only decided to promote technicians who meet the requirements to engineers, but also gave them due care in their study and life. Most of them can have six-fifths of their working days for their own business. Some units have set up special science and technology libraries for them. Their wages and benefits have been correspondingly increased, and their food and accommodation have been significantly improved.

These newly promoted engineers have expressed their desire to contribute more to the cause of socialist construction.

    太原一批技术员被提升为工程师
    本报太原讯　最近，在太原市各厂矿企业里，出现了一批新工程师。他们都是不久以前由技术员提升为工程师的，仅据十个企业统计，在今年五个月内新提拔的工程师，就超过了原有工程师的人数。太原电业局原有工程师九人，今年上半年新提升工程师二十五人。有些单位对于有突出技术的人还予以越级提升。
    这是太原市各厂矿企业积极地贯彻执行党对知识分子政策的具体表现之一。企业党组织不但决定把条件成熟的技术员提升为工程师，并且在学习生活等方面给了他们以应有的照顾。他们中大多数人都可以有六分之五的工作日用于本身业务。有的单位专门为他们设立了科学技术图书馆。他们的工资待遇已有相应的增加，食宿等方面也有显著改善。
    这些新提升的工程师都表示要为社会主义建设事业贡献出更多的力量。
