Xinhua News Agency report: The "May Fourth" wheat, propagated and demonstrated in Shaanxi Province, has achieved another bumper harvest this year.

The ten mu of "May Fourth" wheat propagated by the Shaanxi Provincial Agricultural Comprehensive Experiment Station in Jingyang County yielded an average of more than 700 jin per mu. The "May Fourth" wheat demonstrated and planted by many agricultural cooperatives also had high yields. The "May Fourth" wheat of the May Fourth Agricultural Cooperative in Chang'an County yielded an average of 578 jin per mu, an increase of 46.7% compared to "Bi Ma No. 1" wheat. The "May Fourth" wheat of the Jinfeng Agricultural Cooperative in Dengjia Village, a suburb of Xi'an, averaged 788 jin per mu, 44 jin more than "Bi Ma No. 1" wheat.

This year, the "May Fourth" wheat in various places generally did not experience lodging and had strong resistance to stripe rust and common bunt, with many flowers and grains.

The "May Fourth" wheat variety was cultivated by Zhao Jimin, a technical cadre of the Shaanxi Provincial Agricultural Comprehensive Experiment Station, in 1954. Now, the agricultural department of Shaanxi Province has decided to massively propagate and gradually promote "May Fourth" wheat when sowing wheat this autumn.

    新华社讯　陕西省繁殖和示范种植的“五四号”小麦，今年又得到了丰收。
    陕西省农业综合试验站在泾阳县繁殖的十亩“五四号”小麦，平均每亩收七百多斤。许多农业社示范种植的“五四号”小麦，产量也很高。长安县五四农业社的“五四号”小麦，平均每亩收578斤，比“碧蚂一号”小麦增产46.7％。西安市郊区邓家村进丰农业社的“五四号”小麦，平均每亩达到788斤，比“碧蚂一号”小麦多出四十四斤。
    今年各地“五四号”小麦一般都没有发生倒伏现象，抗条锈病和秆黑粉病的能力很强，多花多粒。
    “五四号”小麦良种是陕西省农业综合试验站技术干部赵济民在1954年培育出来的。现在，陕西省农业部门已经决定在今年秋天播种小麦时大量繁殖和逐步推广“五四号”小麦。
