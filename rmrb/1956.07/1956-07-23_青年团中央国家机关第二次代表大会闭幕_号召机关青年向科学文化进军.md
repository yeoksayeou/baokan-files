Xinhua News Agency, 21st: The Second Representative Congress of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League of China's National Government Organs, which concluded today, passed a resolution on mobilizing the youth of government organs to advance towards science and culture.

This congress was held in Beijing from the 12th to the 21st, focusing on discussing issues related to the advancement of youth in central government organs towards science.

During the congress, Guo Moruo, President of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and Hu Yaobang, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, delivered reports to the congress. In his report, Guo Moruo introduced China's twelve-year science development plan, encouraging the youth of government organs to combine it with their own professional work and strive to advance towards science. He pointed out that in advancing towards science, the youth of government organs must develop the spirit of independent thinking, follow a gradual and orderly approach, study their work in a pragmatic and realistic manner, and establish friendly relations with older scientists, learning from each other and making progress together.

In his report, Hu Yaobang called on the youth of government organs to actively advance towards science and strive to train and cultivate themselves into experts who are loyal to the people and the motherland and proficient in their respective fields. He also pointed out several aspects that the youth of government organs should pay attention to in advancing towards science: First, do not be indecisive, you must choose a goal and persevere to the end; second, do not be greedy for too much or too fast, you must study in a step-by-step manner, and pay attention to physical health, gradually progressing in a steady and solid manner; third, you must integrate and understand, and think independently; fourth, do not be passively dependent, you must cultivate independence; fifth, you must always learn with an open mind, and do not be arrogant and complacent; sixth, do not deviate from reality, one-sided emphasis on reading is not correct, you should accumulate practical work experience.

The delegates unanimously agreed that proposing the issue of youth in government organs advancing towards science at the present time is entirely timely and necessary, and that the direction and policies put forward by the Communist Youth League Committee are correct. In the discussions, the delegates pointed out that in the future, if the Communist Youth League Committee wants to lead the youth of government organs in doing a good job in advancing towards science, it must overcome the serious shortcomings that existed in its past work. The delegates criticized the Communist Youth League Committee for not going deep enough in its work, not being good at grasping typical examples and summarizing experiences to drive overall work; the democratic life within the League is not sound, the spirit of collective leadership of the Communist Youth League Committee is insufficient; the work of the Communist Youth League Committee is too rigid, lacking creativity, resulting in the leadership lagging behind the masses and other shortcomings. The delegates also requested the Communist Youth League Committee to cooperate with relevant departments to solve some of the difficulties faced by the youth of government organs in advancing towards science.

At today's congress, twenty advanced youth collectives and 299 outstanding Communist Youth League members and youths who insisted on spare-time study with achievements or made remarkable achievements in their work, were rewarded and commended. The congress also elected the members of the Third Committee of the Communist Youth League Central Committee of National Government Organs, and eight delegates and three alternate delegates to the Third National Congress of the Communist Youth League.

    新华社21日讯　今天闭幕的青年团中央国家机关第二次代表大会上通过了关于动员机关青年向科学文化进军的决议。
    这次大会是从十二日到二十一日在北京举行，会议着重讨论了中央国家机关青年向科学进军中的问题。
    大会期间，中国科学院院长郭沫若和青年团中央委员会书记处书记胡耀邦曾经到会作了报告。郭沫若在报告中介绍了我国十二年科学发展规划，他鼓励机关青年结合本行业务，努力向科学进军。他指出机关青年在向科学进军中必须发挥独立思考精神，循序渐进，实事求是地钻研业务，并且要和老科学家建立友爱关系，和老科学家一起来互相学习，共同进步。
    胡耀邦在报告中号召机关青年积极向科学进军，努力把自己锻炼和培养成为忠实于人民和祖国、精通本行业务的专家。他并且指出了机关青年在向科学进军中应该注意的几个方面：一、不要三心二意，必须选中目标坚持到底；二、不要贪多贪快，要有步骤地学习，同时要注意身体健康，稳札稳打地逐步渐进；三、要融会贯通，独立思考；四、不要消极依赖，要培养独立性；五、要永远虚心学习，不要骄傲自满；六、不要脱离实际，片面强调读书是不对的，应多多积累实际工作经验。
    到会代表一致认为目前提出机关青年向科学进军问题是完全适时和必要的，团委提出的方向和方针是正确的。代表们在讨论中指出今后团委要领导机关青年作好向科学进军的工作，必须克服以往工作中存在的严重缺点。代表们批评了团委工作深入不够，不善于抓住典型和总结经验以带动全面工作；团内民主生活不健全，团委集体领导精神不够；团委工作太刻板，创造性不够，以致使领导落后于群众等缺点。代表们还提出要求团委配合有关部门解决机关青年在向科学进军中存在的一些困难。
