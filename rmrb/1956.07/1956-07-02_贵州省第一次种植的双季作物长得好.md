Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang, July 1st. The early corn of the more than 1.1 million mu of double-season corn and the early rice of double-season rice planted in Guizhou Province for the first year are expected to have a bumper harvest. At present, most of the 800,000 mu of early corn on the Guizhou Plateau have grown cobs, and some areas with warmer climates have begun to harvest. The average yield of early corn harvested in Guanling County is 345 jin per mu, an increase of 20% over last year; Ceheng, Congjiang and other counties are expected to increase production by 35%. The more than 300,000 mu of early rice have also produced strong ears of rice, reaching the expected production level of double-season rice.

It is an unprecedented event to promote double-season grain crops on a large scale in mountainous Guizhou. In order to achieve a comprehensive increase in double-season production, the agricultural leading departments in various places, according to different regions and different soil qualities, led cooperative members to strengthen crop technical management, and adopted various methods to impart and exchange experience, thus ensuring the vigorous growth of these crops.

    贵州省第一次种植的双季作物长得好
    新华社贵阳1日电　贵州省第一年栽种的110多万亩双季玉米的早玉米和双季稻的早稻丰收在望。现在，贵州高原上80多万亩早玉米大部分生出了棒子，部分气候较热的地区已经开始收获。关岭县收割的早玉米平均每亩345斤，比去年增加20％；册亨、从江等县预计可增产35％。30多万亩的早稻也吐出了茁壮的谷穗，达到了双季稻应有的生产水平。
    在多山的贵州大面积推广双季粮食作物是一件破天荒的事情。为了做到双季全面增产，各地农业领导部门根据不同地区，不同土质领导合作社社员加强了作物技术管理，并且采取多种多样方式，传授和交流了经验，因而保证了这些作物的生长旺盛。
