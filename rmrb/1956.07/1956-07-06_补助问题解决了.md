    Subsidy Problem Solved
    Gao Jie
    In March of this year, the Party organization of the state-owned Shanghai No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory launched a large-scale campaign to visit the homes of workers, especially those with financial difficulties. Nearly 90% of the Party members and more than half of the trade union staff in the cloth machine workshop of the North Weaving Workshop visited the homes of workers with difficulties; the visiting team of the roving workshop in the South Weaving Workshop, jointly organized by the Party, government, and trade union, visited more than 80 workers' families. During the visits, it was discovered that many workers' families were indeed in financial difficulty and should have received subsidies but had not. Everyone deeply felt that in the past, they had not shown enough concern for the workers and decided to expand the subsidies for workers with financial difficulties.
    From late March to the present, this factory has twice provided relatively extensive subsidies to workers with financial difficulties throughout the factory. The first time, a total of 622 workers received subsidies, accounting for approximately 14% of the total number of workers in the factory; the second time, a total of 326 workers received subsidies. Prior to this, only 1% of the factory's workers received monthly hardship subsidies, and the most extensive subsidy was the winter subsidy at the end of last year, which covered only a little over 7%.
    Since liberation, the wages of workers at Shanghai No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory have been continuously increasing along with the growth of production. However, because some workers still have debts from before liberation that have not been paid off, some workers have had too many children in recent years, or have difficulties due to long-term illnesses of themselves or their families, the increased wages are still not enough to meet their needs. According to the investigation by the factory's Party organization and trade union, about 5% to 6% of the total number of workers in the factory regularly experience such financial difficulties.
    In the past, the factory's Party organization and trade union were not completely unaware of these workers' difficulties. However, because there used to be a regulation that "only 20% of the trade union membership dues could be used for worker hardship subsidies," the amount of funds was limited and not enough to provide subsidies. In addition, after opposing the tendency of economism, some staff members mistakenly believed that caring about workers' lives was a tendency of economism, so this problem was not solved for a long time. In 1955, it was decided to extract 5% of the enterprise bonus for worker hardship subsidies, but it was mainly used for year-end winter relief. Therefore, many staff members believed that hardship subsidies were only "emergency relief, not poverty relief," and some staff members even indiscriminately accused workers with financial difficulties of not knowing how to manage their lives. The procedures for applying for hardship subsidies were also excessively strict and cumbersome, requiring the applicant to go through five procedures each time: personal application, group discussion, endorsement by the labor protection committee member and the workshop trade union chairman, and approval by the factory trade union. It took as little as two or three days and as long as six or seven days; sometimes the application was not approved and they were even criticized. Many workers in difficulty preferred to borrow money at interest rather than apply for subsidies.
    In fact, the hardship subsidy funds were not so limited that they could not solve the workers' difficulties. As of the first quarter of this year, the factory had more than 313,000 yuan in accumulated enterprise bonuses and more than 25,000 yuan in accumulated trade union membership dues. Although the higher authorities had regulations on the use of these funds, the factory could still use them if it took the initiative to apply. The funds for the two expanded subsidies this year were drawn from the accumulated enterprise bonuses and trade union membership dues.
    When providing subsidies to workers with financial difficulties, Party and trade union organizations at all levels broke the previous rules and regulations. It was stipulated that for all applications for subsidies, only three procedures were required: personal (or group) application, group discussion, and approval by the workshop trade union labor protection committee member. In this way, each workshop completed the subsidies for workers with difficulties within one or two days. For workers who are often in difficulty, according to the new regulations, subsidies can be given as long as the group recognizes it, without the need for monthly discussions.
    The workers warmly welcomed this subsidy method, and many workers carefully calculated their living expenses and were unwilling for the trade union to subsidize them even a penny more. They said, "I am suffering, but I must try my best to overcome the difficulties. Who cared about us during the reactionary era! Today, the country must use every penny for construction, and we cannot casually ask for the state's money." Wang Yindi, a young weaver in the cloth machine workshop of the North Weaving Workshop, has six younger siblings and a sick mother, all of whom depend on her. The group decided to subsidize her 20 yuan, but she insisted on only taking 10 yuan. These facts deeply educated the cadres. The chairman of the workshop trade union said with emotion, "Our workers are inherently pragmatic. In the past, it was our trade union staff who had shortcomings in their work. We did not take care of the hardships of our worker brothers and sisters, and we did not trust our own class sisters. It was really unnecessary to stipulate such tight and strict procedures for hardship subsidies."
    After the Shanghai No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory conducted such in-depth and meticulous visits and subsidized workers with financial difficulties in their families, the production enthusiasm of the factory's workers was improved, and the production outlook quickly changed. In the roving workshop of the South Weaving Workshop, where there were more older workers and workers with more children, only 55% of the workers were able to fully complete the plan in January of this year, and 15% of the workers often failed to complete the plan. In April, among the 229 workers in this workshop, 108 workers reached an advanced level, and only seven workers were still underperforming. However, this does not mean that the problem has been completely solved. Subsidies are, after all, a passive way to solve the problem. Only by continuously improving the technical level of workers, thereby increasing wages and improving workers' lives, can the problem be fundamentally solved. The factory's Party organization and trade union are working hard to help workers improve their skills. A wave of learning technology and catching up with the advanced has been formed. In workshops such as the cloth machine workshop of the North Weaving Workshop, the roving workshop of the South Weaving Workshop, and the fine yarn workshop of the North Weaving Workshop, approximately 60% to 100% of the workers have signed "sister contracts" or "brother contracts" to jointly improve their skills. The factory leadership has also decided to hold a technical examination every quarter. As long as they pass the examination, they can be upgraded. These regulations have greatly encouraged the workers' enthusiasm for learning technology and will undoubtedly gradually reduce the proportion of workers with difficulties.

    补助问题解决了
    高洁
    今年三月间，国营上海第一棉纺织厂的党组织发起了一个大规模的访问工人家庭、特别是访问生活困难职工的家庭的活动。北织工场布机车间有近90％的党员和半数以上的工会工作人员，都到过困难工人的家庭去访问；南纺工场粗纱车间由党政工团联合组织的访问组，访问了八十多个工人家庭。在访问过程中，发现了很多生活确实困难应该补助而没有补助的工人家庭，大家深深感到过去对工人的关心太不够了，决定扩大对生活困难职工的补助。
    这个厂从今年三月下旬到现在，已经两次比较广泛地对全厂的困难职工进行补助。第一次受补助的职工共622人，约占全厂职工总数的14％；第二次受补助职工共326人。在这以前，这个工厂每月得到困难补助的职工只占全厂职工1％，补助最多的一次是去年年终的冬令补助，补助面也只有7％强。
    解放以来，上海国棉一厂工人的工资随着生产的增长是不断增长的。但是，由于有的工人在解放以前欠下的债到现在还没有还清，有的工人几年来生的孩子太多，或因为本人、家属长期生病造成了困难，工资虽然增长了，仍然不敷需要。根据这个厂党组织和工会的调查，全厂像这样生活经常发生困难的职工要占到职工总人数的5％到6％。
    以往厂的党组织和工会并不是完全不了解这些工人的困难情况。但是由于曾经有过“只能提取工会会费收入的20％用作职工困难补助费”的规定，款额有限，根本不够补助；再加上在反对经济主义倾向以后，有些工作人员错误地认为关心工人生活就是经济主义倾向，因而这个问题便长期没有解决。1955年虽然决定从企业奖励金中提5％做职工困难补助费，但是主要是用作年终冬令救济的。因此，许多工作人员认为困难补助只是“救急不救穷”，有的工作人员甚至不加区别，一概指责生活困难的工人是自己不会安排生活。申请困难补助费的手续也订得过严过繁，每次都要经过本人申请，小组讨论，劳保委员、车间工会主席盖章和厂工会批准等五道手续。少则两三天，多到六、七天；有时申请了不批准，还要受批评。许多有困难的职工宁愿去出利息借钱，也不愿申请补助。
    事实上，困难补助费并不是少到无法解决职工的困难问题。如到今年第一季度止，全厂历年积余下来的企业奖励金还有三十一万三千多元，工会会费也积余两万五千多元。虽然上级对这些款项有规定的用途，但是厂里如果主动提出申请，还是可以动用的。今年两次扩大补助的费用，就都是从企业奖励金和工会会费积余中抽出来的。
    在进行对困难职工补助的时候，各级党和工会组织破除了以往的清规戒律。规定凡是申请补助的，只须本人（或小组）申请，小组讨论，车间工会劳保委员批准三道手续。这样，各车间都在一两天内完成了对困难职工的补助。对经常困难的职工，按新规定，只须小组认可，不需每月讨论，就可以给予补助。
    工人们热烈地欢迎这样的补助方法，许多工人十分切实地核算了自己的生活费用，不愿工会多补助他一分一文。他们说：“我苦是苦，但是自己要尽量克服困难，在反动派的时候，谁来过问呵！今天国家一文一分都要用在建设事业上，我们可不能随便要国家的钱。”北织工场布机车间青年织布工王银弟家有弟妹六人，母亲又生病，都靠她一人负担，小组决定补助她二十元，她坚持只要十元。这些事实深深教育了干部。车间的工会主席感触地说：“我们的工人本来就是实事求是的，过去都是我们工会工作人员工作有缺点，没有照顾工人弟兄的疾苦，还不相信自己的阶级姊妹，把困难补助手续规定得那样紧、那么严，实在是不必要的。”
    国棉一厂进行了这样深入细致的访问，并且补助了家庭生活有困难的职工以后，全厂职工的生产情绪提高了，生产面貌迅速改变了。老工人和多子女工人比较多的南纺工场粗纱车间，今年一月份只有55％的工人能够全面完成计划，有15％的工人经常完不成计划。四月份这个车间229个工人中，有108个工人达到了先进的水平，生产差的只剩下七个工人。但是，这并不是说问题就彻底解决了。补助毕竟是消极的解决问题的办法，只有不断提高工人的技术水平，从而提高工资来改善工人的生活，才是根本解决问题的办法。厂的党组织和工会正努力帮助工人提高技术。一个学习技术、赶上先进的热潮已经形成。北织工场布机车间、南纺工场粗纱车间和北纺工场细纱车间等车间，差不多60％到100％的工人都订了“姊妹合同”或“兄弟合同”来共同提高技术。厂的领导方面还决定每一季度举行一次技术考试，只要考试及格就可以升级。这些规定，大大鼓舞了工人学习技术的热情，也无疑会逐渐减少困难职工的比重。
