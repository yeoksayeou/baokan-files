　　Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 6th: The third flood peak of the Yellow River just entered the sea today, and the fourth flood peak is following closely behind.
    This flood peak has a larger flow rate than the first and third flood peaks, but smaller than the second.
    Like the previous three times, this flood peak mainly originates from the Wei River. From the 2nd to the 3rd, there was widespread rainfall in the middle reaches of the Wei River, a major tributary of the Yellow River, and the middle and upper reaches of the Jing River. Subsequently, the rain area shifted to the Qingjian Yan River in northern Shaanxi and the Fen River basin in Shanxi Province. Therefore, the confluence of floods from the main and tributary streams of the Yellow River formed the fourth flood peak that appeared in Qinchang.

    黄河洪峰接踵而来
    新华社郑州六日电　黄河第三次洪峰刚在今天入海，第四次洪峰又接踵而来。
    这次洪峰流量比第一次和第三次洪峰的流量大，比第二次小。
    像前三次一样，这次洪峰主要来源于渭河。二日到三日，黄河大支流渭河的中游和泾河的中上游地区普遍降雨，随后雨区转到陕北清涧延水和山西省汾河流域。因此，黄河干支流的洪水汇合起来，就形成了在秦厂出现的第四次洪峰。
