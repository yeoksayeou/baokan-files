Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, July 1st (Xinhua News Agency reporter Fang Ling): The first standard small folding camera made in China has been manufactured at the joint state-private Tianjin Camera Factory. The factory's employees specially named it the "July 1st" - Model 1 camera to celebrate the 35th anniversary of the Communist Party of China.

This camera has a very stylish appearance. Its lens is composed of four concave and convex lenses, providing strong resolving power. The highest shutter speed is 1/300th of a second. The reporter saw several enlarged photographs, magnified thirty-three times, taken with this lens installed on other camera bodies. The lines and colors of the people and scenery were very clear and accurate. The camera's distance measurement and viewfinder mechanisms are combined, allowing the photographer to view the scene through the same viewfinder while adjusting the distance by turning a linked regulator. It also has a flash synchronization device, a self-timer, and an automatic film stop counting device. The camera body is made of aluminum-magnesium alloy, making it light and sturdy.

This factory was formed by merging several small camera repair shops in Tianjin after the implementation of joint state-private ownership. These repair shops have a history of twenty-five years in Tianjin. Although the workers possess relatively skilled techniques and rich experience, they could only perform some component repair work in the past due to a lack of funds and raw materials, as well as being scattered in operation. It was not until after the implementation of joint state-private ownership that their long-cherished wish of manufacturing cameras themselves using domestic materials was realized. They are now preparing to build factory buildings in preparation for mass production. They are also preparing to start trial production of another small camera.

    “七一”1型照相机
    新华社天津1日电　新华社记者方凌报道：中国自己制造的第一架标准小型折叠式照相机，在公私合营天津照相机制造厂制造出来了。这个工厂的职工为了庆祝中国共产党三十五周年，特地把它命名为“七一”——1型照相机。
    这种照相机样式很大方，它的镜头是用四片凹凸镜组成的，结相力很强。快门的最高速度是三百分之一秒。记者看到几张用这种镜头装在别的镜箱上试拍的放大了三十三倍的大幅相片，人物和风景的线条、光色，都十分清楚、正确。照相机的测量距离和取景的机关合在一起，照相的人可以在同一个镜孔里取景，同时拨动一个和它联动的调节器来调整距离。它还有闪光灯的联动装置和自拍以及自动停片计数装置。镜箱是用铝镁合金做的，又轻又坚固。
    这个工厂是天津市一些修理照相机的小工厂在公私合营以后组织起来的。这些修理厂在天津已经有二十五年的历史，职工们虽然有较熟练的技术和丰富的经验，但是由于过去资金和原料都很缺乏，又是分散经营，只能作一些机件修理工作。直到公私合营以后，这种向往多年的用国产的器材自己动手来制造照相机的愿望，才得到实现。现在他们正在筹备建设厂房，准备成批生产。另外还准备开始试制另一种小型的照相机。
