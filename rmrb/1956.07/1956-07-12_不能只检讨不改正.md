    Cannot Only Self-Criticize Without Correcting
    The "Reader's Letters" page of the People's Daily on April 1st exposed that the Jixi Mining Bureau's Didao Coal Mine frequently extended workers' working hours. On May 13th, the self-criticism of the Jixi Mining Bureau was published. However, while they were making self-criticism, they continued to extend workers' working hours as usual. Calculating only the overtime exceeding four hours per shift, the three wellheads of Didao Mine's No. 3 Well, No. 4 Well, and No. 8 Well extended a total of 5,720 hours in April. From May 2nd to May 13th, the four wellheads of No. 2 Well, No. 3 Well, No. 4 Well, and No. 8 Well extended a total of more than 4,000 hours. Some workers worked underground continuously for 21 hours, were extremely exhausted, and their health was greatly affected.
    Currently, the leaders of Didao Mine do not dare to publicize the state's labor protection policies to the workers. Not long ago, the Didao Mine No. 8 Well Trade Union planned to publicize the state's laws and regulations restricting overtime, but later they were afraid that the workers would have even more opinions after the publicity, so they did not publicize it.
    Didao Mine's style of only making self-criticism without correcting mistakes is very bad. It is recommended that relevant leaders seriously investigate and severely deal with this matter. Yu Yingchao

    不能只检讨不改正
    四月一日人民日报“读者来信专页”揭发鸡西矿务局滴道煤矿经常延长工人的工作时间，五月十三日发表了鸡西矿务局的检讨。但是，他们一面检讨，一面照旧延长工人的工作时间。只按每班延长工作时间四小时以上的加点时间计算，四月份滴道矿三井、四井、八井三个井口，共延长五千七百二十小时。五月二日到十三日，二井、三井、四井、八井四个井口，共延长四千多个小时。有些工人连续在井下工作二十一小时，疲劳不堪，健康很受影响。
    目前，滴道矿的领导人员都不敢向工人宣传国家的劳动保护政策。不久以前，滴道矿八井工会打算宣传国家限制加班加点的法令，后来怕宣传以后工人们的意见更多了，就没有宣传。
    滴道矿这种光作检讨而不改正错误的作风，是很不好的。建议有关领导方面认真检查并严肃处理这件事。于英超
