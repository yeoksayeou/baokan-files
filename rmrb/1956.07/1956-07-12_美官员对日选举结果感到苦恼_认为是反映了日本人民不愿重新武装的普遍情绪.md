Xinhua News Agency, July 11th: According to a United Press International dispatch from Washington, American officials said on the 10th that they were distressed that the Japanese Liberal Democratic Party had not won enough seats in the Senate to allow them to amend the constitution for full rearmament.

The report said that "certain authorities" in Washington were apparently surprised by the scale of the victory achieved by the Japanese Socialist Party, which gained twelve seats in this election.

The State Department declined to issue an official comment, but officials privately admitted that they were disappointed that Prime Minister Hatoyama had not been able to secure enough seats in the Senate to enable Japan's military to be strengthened to the point where Japan could play a greater role in the "anti-communist defense network" in the region. For several years, the US government has repeatedly requested that the size and scope of Japan's military forces be expanded.

UPI said that Washington's view is that the Japanese Socialist Party's victory in the election on the 8th can almost entirely be attributed to the rearmament issue. US officials said: The Socialist Party's victory in this Senate election clearly reflects the general sentiment of an increasing number of Japanese people, who have shown relatively little willingness to undertake large-scale rearmament efforts.

    美官员对日选举结果感到苦恼
    认为是反映了日本人民不愿重新武装的普遍情绪
    新华社11日讯　据合众社华盛顿消息，美国官员们十日说，对于日本自由民主党没有能够在参议院中赢得足够的席位使他们能够修改宪法以进行充分的重新武装这件事情，他们感到苦恼。
    消息说，显然华盛顿的“某些权威人士”对于日本社会党人所取得的胜利之大是感到惊奇的。社会党在这次选举中增加了十二席。
    国务院拒绝发表正式的评论，但是官员们私下都承认他们感到失望，因为鸠山首相没有能够在参议院中取得足够的席位使日本的军队能够加强到使日本能够在这一地区的“反共防御网”中起更大的作用。好几年来，美国政府曾经一再要求扩大日本军事力量的规模和范围。
    合众社说，华盛顿的看法是，日本社会党在八日的选举中的胜利几乎完全可以说是由于重新武装问题。美国官员们说：社会党在这次参议院选举中的胜利显然是反映了愈来愈多的日本人民的普遍情绪，这些日本人对于进行大规模的重新武装工作一直表现出比较不大愿意。
