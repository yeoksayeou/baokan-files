Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, 23rd – The Inner Mongolia Daily published on its front page on the 21st the "Instructions on Studying Nationalities Policy and Inspecting the Implementation of Nationalities Policy" recently issued by the CPC Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Committee to Party committees at all levels in the autonomous region.

The instructions first summarized the great achievements that the autonomous region has made in the socialist transformation and construction. There are now 4,374 jointly-owned ethnic agricultural production cooperatives and 355 pastoral production cooperatives in the region. Various types of agricultural and pastoral mutual aid groups have also developed significantly. This has further strengthened the new ethnic relations of mutual assistance and common development among all ethnic groups in production and life. The instructions emphasized that in the rapid development and continuous victories of socialist transformation and construction, there is a tendency in some areas to neglect ethnic work. Some leading departments and regions do not have a sufficient understanding of the characteristics of the autonomous region as a multi-ethnic area in developing economic and cultural undertakings. They have not done enough to further study and specifically implement the nationalities policy in response to new issues raised in socialist transformation and construction, often causing work to become generalized.

The instructions also pointed out that nationalist ideological tendencies, especially Han chauvinist tendencies, still affect the ethnic unity and the smooth progress of construction in the autonomous region to a certain extent. For example, there is still a lack of concrete plans to help all ethnic minorities develop economic and cultural construction; the work of training and promoting ethnic minority cadres has not kept up with actual needs. Some ethnic minority areas still do not have leadership cadres from their own ethnic groups. Some even dislike ethnic minority cadres for being backward, having low levels of education, and being weak in ability, arbitrarily persuading them to return home to engage in production.

The instructions stipulated that this region-wide study and inspection will be carried out in the third quarter of this year. During the inspection, cadres and workers of all organs, organizations, enterprises, schools, and troops in the region will be organized to study the Party's nationalities policy through various forms; at the same time, forces will be organized to conduct extensive and in-depth publicity and education among the people of all ethnic groups. Then, based on the various behaviors that violate nationalities policy found during the inspection, nationalist ideology, mainly Han chauvinist tendencies, will be criticized, and phenomena that neglect ethnic work and violate the Party's nationalities and religious policies will be corrected.

The instructions require that the following issues be examined through this study: 1. How to ensure increased production and income for the Mongolian people and other ethnic minorities after joining agricultural cooperatives; 2. To study the development direction of the economies of all ethnic minorities, formulate plans for ethnic minority work, and formulate plans for training and promoting ethnic minority cadres; 3. To solve the problem of relocation caused by the Mongolian people joining agricultural cooperatives and other reasons in some areas of the autonomous region; 4. The employment and living arrangements for Hui Muslim business owners and merchants in the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce; 5. Preparations for the Daurs to implement regional autonomy and establish ethnic townships, as well as the determination of the names of some other ethnic minorities.

    中共内蒙古自治区委员会发出指示
    学习民族政策　检查执行情况
    据新华社呼和浩特23日电　二十一日内蒙古日报第一版刊登了中共内蒙古自治区委员会最近发给自治区各级党委的“关于学习民族政策和检查民族政策执行情况”的指示。
    指示中首先概述了自治区在社会主义改造和建设事业中，已取得的巨大成绩，现在全区共有民族联合的农业生产合作社4，374个，牧业生产合作社355个；各种类型农牧业互助组也有大量发展。这就在生产生活上更加强了各民族间的互相帮助共同发展的新的民族关系。指示着重指出：在社会主义改造和建设事业迅速向前发展和不断取得胜利中，各地产生了一种忽视民族工作的倾向，有些领导部门和地区在发展经济文化事业中，对自治区是一个多民族地区的特点尚认识不足，对社会主义改造和建设事业中提出的新问题，如何进一步研究具体贯彻执行民族政策作得不够，往往使工作陷于一般化。
    指示中还指出民族主义思想倾向特别是大民族主义思想倾向，仍然一定程度地影响着自治区的民族团结和建设事业的顺利进行。如对帮助各少数民族发展经济文化建设，还缺乏具体规划；培养与提拔少数民族干部的工作也赶不上实际需要，个别少数民族聚居区到现在还没有本民族的领导干部，有的甚至嫌民族干部落后、文化低、能力弱，任意劝退他们回家生产。
    指示中规定这一全区性的学习和检查，在今年第三季度进行。检查中要组织全区各机关、团体、企业、学校和部队的干部、职工，通过各种形式进行一次党的民族政策学习；同时组织力量在各族人民群众中进行广泛深入的宣传教育。然后，根据检查出来的各种违犯民族政策的行为，批判民族主义思想，主要是大民族主义思想倾向，纠正忽视民族工作及违犯党的民族政策、宗教政策的现象。
    指示要求通过这次学习，检查以下问题：一、解决蒙古族人民及其他少数民族参加农业社后，如何做到增产增加收入问题；二、研究各少数民族经济的发展方向，制定少数民族工作规划，制定培养提拔少数民族干部的规划；三、要解决自治区内部分地区蒙古族人民入农业社后和其他各种原因所引起的搬家问题；四、资本主义工商业社会主义改造中，对回民工商户就业和生活安排问题；五、有关达呼尔族推行区域自治建立民族乡的准备工作以及其他一些少数民族名称的确定等。
