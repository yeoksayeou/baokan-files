In his speech, he also said that he had discussed the Algerian issue with the French Foreign Minister in Paris. He said: "I believe that France will strive to resolve this issue through negotiations with Algerian nationalists. The aspirations of the Algerian people have our full support. The most urgent need is a peaceful solution to this problem. We told France: 'A ceasefire should be guaranteed, the shooting should stop, and representatives from both sides should sit down and discuss the issue.'"

    新华社喀喇蚩23日电　巴基斯坦外交部长乔德里昨天说，巴基斯坦政府“一贯认为应该让中国成为联合国的会员。”
    乔德里在到欧洲访问了五个星期以后回到喀喇蚩的时候在机场上对记者发表谈话。他说，巴基斯坦在中国进入联合国问题上的看法是人所共知的。
    他在谈话中还说他在巴黎曾经同法国外交部长讨论过阿尔及利亚问题。他说：“我相信法国将会努力通过同阿尔及利亚民族主义者谈判的办法来解决这个问题。阿尔及利亚人的愿望得到我们的完全支持。最迫切需要的是和平解决这个问题。我们告诉法国说：“应该保证停火，射击应该停止，双方的代表应该坐下来讨论这个问题。”
