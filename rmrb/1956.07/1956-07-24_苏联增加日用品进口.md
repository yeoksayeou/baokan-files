    苏联增加日用品进口
    新华社莫斯科22日电　苏联对外贸易部进口管理局长菲诺格诺夫在今天“苏维埃俄罗斯报”上发表的一篇谈话中说，中国的雨衣美观耐用，在苏联消费者中享有信誉，现在将从中国进口大批的雨衣。此外，还要从中国进口男外衣、美丽的雨伞、地毡、毛织品、线织品等货物。
    苏联政府为了满足苏联人民的需要，目前正在增加从人民民主国家和其他国家进口日用品。苏联消费者不久就可以买到世界驰名的捷克斯洛伐克的鞋类、缝纫品，和民主越南的鞋子、编织用具。从南斯拉夫、保加利亚、罗马尼亚和民主德国，要运来大批的家具、皮毛制品，南斯拉夫的鞋类也将首次在苏联市场上出现。
    苏联今年还向印度订购了大量的日用品和纺织品；向芬兰订购了许多缝纫机器。苏联将向英国输出大批火柴换回英国的纺织品和各种日用品。
