Post-Editing Thoughts

　　The Party Central Committee and the State Council, in their instructions on the compilation of the 1956 national economic plan, requested that the industrial sector make significant achievements this year in improving product quality and increasing the variety of designs and colors. Now, half a year has passed, and while there are indeed many products with significant quality improvements, there are also quite a few with no or little improvement. Problems such as poor steel quality, insufficient precision of machine parts, high shrinkage rates of cotton cloth, insufficient variety of patterns in printed cloth, flimsy knitwear, non-durable rubber shoes, leaky raincoats, and inaccurate clocks are by no means limited to one factory or one province or city. However, so far, while the scale of Tianjin Municipal People's Committee's plan to improve the quality of more than a thousand products and increase more than two thousand varieties of designs and colors at once is unprecedented, even comprehensive planning for improving product quality and increasing product varieties at the factory level is rare. Therefore, we believe that the "Tianjin Municipal Industrial 1956-1957 Work Outline for Improving Quality and Increasing Variety" announced by the Tianjin Municipal People's Committee is indeed a very meaningful initiative. We hope that similar outlines will appear in other provinces and cities in the near future.

　　A careful reading of the news report about this outline reveals that it is not only an outline for improving product quality and increasing the variety of designs and colors, but also a comprehensive work outline for developing local industrial production centered on improving product quality and increasing the variety of designs and colors. We can imagine that after this outline is implemented, the management level of enterprises will be improved, the technical leadership work will be strengthened, the technical level of enterprises will be raised, new technical talents will be born, and new management styles will also be established. This is precisely the valuable aspect of this outline.

　　Since the opposition to the tendency of only focusing on saving while neglecting product quality was put forward, some enterprises have gone to another extreme: focusing only on product quality while neglecting saving raw materials and reducing costs. The Tianjin Municipal Local Industry's Work Outline for Improving Quality and Increasing Variety does not mention the relationship between quality and saving. We hope that the workers and staff of Tianjin's local industries, when implementing this outline, can not only improve product quality, increase varieties and designs, but also save raw materials, reduce costs, and increase accumulation at the same time!

    编后杂感
    党中央和国务院，曾在关于编制1956年国民经济计划的指示中，要求工业部门今年在改进产品质量、增产品种花色方面，切实做出一番成绩来。现在，半年的时间已经过去了，质量有显著改进的产品固然为数不少，但是毫无改进或改进不大的也不在少数。像钢材的质量不好，机器零件的精密度不够，棉布缩水率大，花布的花样不够丰富多彩，针织品不结实，胶鞋不耐磨，防雨衣漏水，钟表不准等等，绝不只是在一个厂或一个省市里存在的毛病。然而，到现在为止，像天津市人民委员会那样，一次作出改进一千多种产品质量和增加两千多品种花色的规划规模固然是空前的，就是以一个工厂为单位，对改进产品质量和增加产品品种，加以全面规划的事情也是不多的。因此，我们觉得天津市人民委员会公布的“天津市工业1956年到1957年提高质量，增加品种的工作纲要”，确实是一个很有意义的创举。我们希望在不久的将来，别的省市也出现类似的纲要。
    仔细读一读关于这个纲要的新闻报道，便知道它并不仅是改进产品质量、增加品种花色的纲要，而是一个以改进产品质量、增加品种花色为中心的发展地方工业生产的全面工作纲要。我们可以想像出来，当这个纲要实现以后，企业的管理水平提高了，技术领导工作加强了，企业的技术水平提高了，新的技术人材诞生了，新的经营作风也树立起来了。这也正是这个纲要的可贵之处。
    自从提出反对只顾节约忽视产品质量的偏向以后，有些企业又走到另一个极端：只顾产品质量，忽视节约原材料和降低成本。天津市地方工业改进质量、增加品种的工作纲要里，没有说明质量和节约的关系。我们希望天津市地方工业的职工们，在实现这个纲要的时候，能够做到既提高产品质量，增加品种和花色，又同时做到节约原材料，降低成本，增加积累！
