    Where are the Methods to Bring into Play the Enthusiasm of the Masses Inside and Outside the Party?
    Commentator of this Newspaper
    The Xiaoshan County Committee of Zhejiang Province recently held several symposiums with agency cadres, district committee secretaries, and township branch secretaries to discuss how to bring into play the enthusiasm of the masses inside and outside the Party. These symposiums were very fruitful. Everyone identified many things that were hindering the enthusiasm of Party members and the masses, such as: the subjective commandism of the county committee in leading the cooperative movement and the agricultural production increase movement, which seriously dampened the enthusiasm of cadres and the masses; the leadership's insufficient concern for the difficulties in the lives of cadres—in the county People's Bank, supply and marketing cooperative, and tax bureau alone, there were seventy-nine people whose work enthusiasm was affected by life difficulties... Everyone not only criticized the shortcomings of the leading organs but also put forward more than two hundred positive suggestions.
    After listening to everyone's opinions, the Xiaoshan County Committee realized that it should bring everyone's enthusiasm into play by promoting democracy, adhering to the mass line, and caring for the political thought and material life of Party members. The comrades who participated in the symposiums were also very satisfied, and they requested: "It would be best to hold more meetings like this in the future."
    Currently, many Party organizations are considering how to bring into play the enthusiasm of the masses inside and outside the Party, and many people feel that this is a big problem, and they don’t know where to start. In this regard, the Xiaoshan County Committee's approach is worth noting. To bring into play the enthusiasm of the masses inside and outside the Party, we should know why everyone's enthusiasm could not be brought into play in the past, and we should talk with Party members and the masses, listen to their opinions, demands, and difficulties, and listen to what they think is conducive to bringing into play the enthusiasm of those below and what is hindering the enthusiasm of those below in the leadership's work. In this way, the Party organization can have a clear understanding and know where to start.
    Of course, to bring into play the enthusiasm of Party members, the Party organization needs to take many measures, and holding symposiums is only one of them. However, the spirit of consulting with the masses when things arise, which the Xiaoshan County Committee embodied in holding the symposiums, is something that any Party organization should emulate, and more importantly, it is necessary to implement this spirit in all aspects of the Party organization's daily activities. To enable the broad masses inside and outside the Party to fully exert their enthusiasm, there are many conditions required, but the most important of these is to give them ample opportunity to express their opinions on the Party's policies and on various tasks, and to make them feel that their various opinions will be valued by the leadership, that good opinions will be adopted by the leadership, that erroneous views will be corrected, that doubts will be answered, that various legitimate demands will be met, and that difficulties in work, study, and life will be helped and gradually overcome... This requires the Party organization to be good at better combining the top-down implementation of leadership intentions with the bottom-up listening to opinions, paying attention to consulting with lower-level Party member cadres at any time and any place, absorbing their correct opinions, enriching leadership experience, and correcting deviations in work.
    However, in the daily activities of some Party organizations, whether it is holding work meetings or Party meetings, whether it is Party life or the daily contact between leaders and general Party members, often it is only the top-down transmission of leadership intentions and the deployment of tasks, with those below making guarantees, or leaders criticizing shortcomings in work, with lower-level cadres making self-criticisms; whether in various meetings or in personal contact between superiors and subordinates, these leaders rarely consciously inspire everyone to use their brains to consider whether the tasks put forward by the superiors are realistic and whether the measures taken are correct. Some leading cadres frown when they hear opinions that are inconsistent with their own intentions, or when they hear lower-level cadres talk about difficulties in their work, and even criticize those who raise opinions of "emphasizing difficulties" and having "conservative ideas" without analysis. When some leading cadres are in contact with lower-level cadres, they often only talk about work, and rarely patiently and kindly inquire about what problems and demands lower-level cadres have in their lives and thoughts. Under the influence of this unhealthy leadership style, many cadres slowly become able to only mechanically obey orders, whatever the superiors say is what it is, whatever they are told to do is what they do, and gradually lose the ability to think independently. The relationship between superiors and subordinates also slowly becomes simplified to just the allocation and acceptance of tasks, and rarely sees the normal comradely relationship of mutual care. Just imagine, in this situation, how can everyone bring their enthusiasm into play?
    There are also some leaders who, in form, also pay attention to listening to opinions from below, but do not seriously improve their work based on correct opinions, take measures, meet the various legitimate demands of those below in terms of life, study, and politics, and overcome various difficulties. This will only make everyone feel that: I say mine, you do yours, there is no difference between saying and not saying. In this case, everyone's enthusiasm also cannot be fully brought into play!
    The most fundamental way to bring into play the enthusiasm of the masses inside and outside the Party is to consult with the masses when things arise, listen to the opinions of the masses, and improve work based on the correct opinions of the masses; at the same time, pay attention to caring for the lives of the masses and helping the masses solve problems in their lives.

    发挥党内外群众积极性的办法在哪里
    本报评论员
    浙江萧山县委最近召开了几个机关干部、区委书记和乡支部书记的座谈会，座谈怎样发挥党内外群众的积极性的问题。这几个座谈会的收获很大。大家从很多方面找出了束缚党员和群众积极性的东西，比如：县委在领导合作化运动和农业增产运动中的主观主义命令主义，曾经严重地挫伤了干部和群众的积极性；领导方面对干部生活中的困难关怀不够，仅县人民银行、供销合作社、税务局三个单位，因为生活困难而影响了工作积极性的就有七十九人……。大家不但批评了领导机关的缺点，而且提出了二百多条积极的建议。
    萧山县委听取了大家的意见，就认识到应该从发扬民主、坚持群众路线、关心党员的政治思想和物质生活等方面来发挥大家的积极性。参加座谈会的同志也都很满意，他们要求：“像这样的会，今后最好多开开”。
    现在，很多党组织都在考虑怎样发挥党内外群众的积极性的问题，很多人都感到这个问题很大，一时不知从何着手。在这个问题上，萧山县委的做法是值得注意的。要发挥党内外群众的积极性，就应该知道过去大家的积极性为什么不能发挥，就应该和党内外群众谈谈，听听他们有什么意见、要求和困难，听听他们认为领导工作中哪些是有利于发挥下边积极性的，哪些是束缚下边积极性的。这样，就可以使党组织心里有数，知道从何着手。
    当然，要发挥党员的积极性，党组织要采取很多措施，召开座谈会只是办法之一。但是，萧山县委在召开座谈会中所贯串的有事和群众商量的精神，却是任何一个党组织都应该效法的，而且更重要的是把这种精神贯彻在党组织日常活动的各个方面。要广大的党内外群众能充分发挥积极性，需要有多方面的条件，但是，其中最重要的是，要使他们对党的政策和对各种工作都有充分发表意见的机会，而且要使他们感觉到他们的各种意见都会得到领导的重视，好的意见会被领导上采纳，错误的看法会得到纠正，疑问会得到解答，各种正当的要求会得到满足，工作、学习和生活中的困难会得到帮助而逐步克服……。这就需要党组织善于把自上而下地贯彻领导意图和自下而上地听取意见更好地结合起来，随时随地注意和下边的党员干部商量问题，吸取他们的正确意见，丰富领导经验，纠正工作中的偏差。
    但是，在有些党组织的日常活动中，不论是召开工作会议或党的会议，不论是党的生活或领导人员和一般党员的日常接触中，往往只是自上而下的传达领导意图，布置任务，下边提出保证，或者是领导者批评工作中的缺点，下边干部进行检讨；不论在各种会议或上下级之间的个人接触中，这些领导者都很少有意识地启发大家开动脑筋考虑上级提出的任务是否切合实际，采取的措施是否正确。有些领导干部听见和自己意图不一致的意见，听见下级干部谈工作中的困难，就皱眉头，甚至不加分析地批评提意见的人“强调困难”，有“保守思想”。有些领导干部和下级干部接触的时候，常常是只谈工作，而很少耐心地亲切地询问一下下级干部生活、思想中有什么问题和要求。在这种不良的领导作风影响下，就使很多干部慢慢变得只能机械地服从命令，上级说什么就是什么，叫干什么就干什么，逐渐失去独立思考的能力。上下级之间的关系也就慢慢地简单到只是分配任务和接受任务，而很少看到正常的互相关怀的同志关系。试想，在这种情况下，大家怎么会发挥自己的积极性呢？
    还有一些领导者，他们在形式上也注意自下而上地听取意见，但却不去认真地根据正确的意见改进工作，采取措施，满足下边提出的生活、学习以及政治方面的各种正当的要求，克服各种困难。这样，只会使大家感觉到：我说我的，你干你的，说和不说没有什么区别。在这种情况下，大家的积极性同样不能充分发挥！
    发挥党内外群众积极性的最根本的办法，就是有事和群众商量，听取群众的意见，根据群众正确的意见改进工作；同时注意关心群众生活，帮助群众解决生活中的问题。
