Xinhua News Agency, Xining, July 1st. 113,500 mu of spring wheat and vegetables are growing well in the Qaidam Basin of Qinghai Province, with spring wheat generally growing to a height of 1.2 to 1.3 chi. These were planted by nine state-owned farms to supply the petroleum exploration personnel with locally grown food.

Seven of the nine farms were established this spring. The first farm here was established in 1954.

The Qaidam Basin is 2,600 meters above sea level. The high and wide basin has particularly long hours of sunshine. In summer, some areas can see the sun for fourteen or fifteen hours a day. The spring wheat here is sown in April, and the wheat fields are open and flat, suitable for both machine耕种 and convenient for irrigation. At the Delingha Farm on the eastern edge of the basin, more than 20,000 mu of wheat fields are connected in a large area, green and boundless. This year, more than 11,000 mu of land on this farm was cultivated by machines. At the Golmud Farm, more than 2,800 meters above sea level, the clear snow water from the northern foot of the Kunlun Mountains is introduced into the flat wheat fields through two large canals and countless small canals.

Water conservancy projects are more important in the basin than elsewhere. Because the soil here contains more salt and alkali, it needs to be soaked and washed to transform the soil before it is suitable for crop growth. Now, all nine farms have built their own irrigation canal systems for soaking and washing the soil and irrigating crops.

    柴达木盆地一片新绿
    九个农场为勘探人员种了大量小麦蔬菜
    新华社西宁1日电　青海省柴达木盆地里的十一万三千五百亩春麦和蔬菜生长良好，春麦普遍长到一尺二、三寸高。这是九个国营农场为了就地供应石油勘探人员食用而播种的。
    九个农场中有七个是今年春天才建立的。这里建立第一个农场是在1954年。
    柴达木盆地拔海两千六百公尺。又高又宽阔的盆地里，日照时间特别长。夏季，有的地区每天有十四、五个小时能够看到太阳。这里的春麦是四月间播种的，麦田开阔平坦，既适宜用机器耕种，又便于引水灌溉。在盆地东沿的德令哈农场，两万多亩麦田连成一大片，绿油油的望不到边。这个农场今年有一万一千多亩地是用机器耕种的。在拔海两千八百多公尺的格尔穆农场，昆仑山北麓的清澈的雪水被两条大渠和无数条小渠引进平坦的麦田。
    水利工程在盆地里比在别的地方更为重要。因为这里土质含盐分和碱分较多，要经过泡洗等改造土壤的过程才适于农作物生长。现在，这九个农场都修建了自己的灌溉渠系，用以泡洗土壤和浇灌农作物。
