Well-Run Canteen

    This newspaper reports: The cooks of the Yumen Pit workers' canteen in the Ximing Mine of the Taiyuan Xishan Mining Bureau resolutely implement the "five no-sale system": food that is not of sufficient quantity is not sold, food that is not hygienic is not sold, rotten food is not sold, cold food is not sold, and undercooked food is not sold. They do not serve the same food every week, and whether it is white flour, corn flour, sorghum flour... they carefully prepare it in various ways, making it delicious and palatable. Currently, the Yumen Pit canteen has eighteen varieties of staple food and about twenty varieties of non-staple food. Miners can enjoy dumplings, fried dough twists, sweet bread, braised pancakes, radish and green onion balls, and other dishes. Since late April, the cooks have also designated one person to personally deliver boiled water, porridge, and sweet bread to the work sites inside the pit.

    In the past, the cooks believed that this canteen was located deep in the mountains, with simple equipment, and that buying rice and vegetables required traversing mountains, so they lacked confidence in running the canteen well. Therefore, there were very few varieties of food, and they performed their duties routinely, leaving work on time. Workers who came out of the pit a little late could not get food, and they had many complaints about the canteen. With the vigorous development of the advanced producer movement, the cooks deeply felt that doing a good job in the canteen was important for ensuring production. They were determined, thought of many ways, and finally achieved their current success.

    食堂办得好
    本报讯　太原西山矿务局西铭矿玉门坑矿工食堂的炊事员们，坚决执行“五不卖制度”：食品不够分量不卖，不卫生不卖，腐烂的饭菜不卖，冷饭不卖，饭菜不熟不卖。每星期不让大家吃重样饭，不管白面、玉米面、高粱面……都要精心细作，花样翻新，味美可口。目前，玉门坑食堂主食品花样有十八种，副食品花样有二十种左右。饺子、麻叶、糖面包、焖饼、萝?葱丸子等饭菜，矿工们都能吃上。从四月下旬起，炊事员们还抽出一个人亲自把开水、稀饭、糖面包送到坑内工作地点。
    过去，炊事员们认为这个食堂深居山沟，设备简单，买米买菜还得翻山越岭，对办好食堂缺乏信心，因而饭菜花样很少，公事公办，到点下班。工人们从坑内出来稍迟一些，就吃不到饭，对食堂很有意见。随着先进生产者运动的蓬勃开展，炊事员们深深感到，做好食堂工作，对保证生产有重要作用，他们下定了决心，想了许多办法，终于获得了现在这样的成绩。
