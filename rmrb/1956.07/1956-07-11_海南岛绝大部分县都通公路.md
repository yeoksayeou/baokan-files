Xinhua News Agency, Haikou, July 7th. The twelve highways planned for construction on Hainan Island in the second half of this year have successively commenced. These highways, with a total length of four hundred kilometers, are longer than all the highways built during the thirty-plus years of the Kuomintang reactionary government's rule over Hainan Island.

　　The newly built highways are distributed in the island's tropical economic crop reclamation areas, important fishing ports, salt fields, mountainous areas inhabited by ethnic minorities, and some key townships in various counties, and are connected to the island's existing highway trunk lines.

　　When Hainan Island was liberated in April 1950, the entire island had only three hundred and fifty kilometers of dilapidated highways. Since then, the state has newly built more than two thousand eight hundred kilometers of highways on the island. Now, most counties on the island are accessible by highway.

    海南岛绝大部分县都通公路
    新华社海口7日电　海南岛今年下半年计划修建的十二条公路陆续开始动工。这些公路全长四百公里，比国民党反动政府统治海南岛三十多年修建的公路还要长。
    新修的公路分布在岛上的热带经济作物垦殖区、重要渔港、盐场、少数民族聚居的山区和各县的一部分重点乡，并和岛上已有的公路干线联接起来。
    1950年4月海南岛解放的时候，全岛只有三百五十公里破烂不堪的公路。从那时到现在，国家在岛上新修了二千八百多公里的公路。现在全岛绝大部分县都有公路通达。
