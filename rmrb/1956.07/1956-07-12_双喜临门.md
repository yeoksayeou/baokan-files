Double Happiness
By our correspondent, Pei Da

In June, two joyous events occurred in Nagoya, Japan's third largest city: the public hall, which had been forcibly occupied by the American military for over a decade, was returned to the hands of the Japanese people; and within this very public hall, the citizens of Nagoya enjoyed a splendid performance by the Chinese Peking Opera Troupe.

Speaking of the first joyous event, many citizens recount their suffering over the past decade and more.

Nagoya is built on the Nōbi Plain, one of Japan's three major plains, facing Ise Bay to the south. The city boasts a variety of modern industries, particularly aircraft manufacturing, which experienced rapid growth during the war. After the war, the American occupation forces took a liking to this place. In the city center, while the craters from American bombs were still hot, the US military built officers' residences there, occupying 165,000 square meters. Large signs proclaiming "Japanese Entry Strictly Prohibited" blocked traffic in all directions and hindered the development of municipal construction. The locals aptly named it "America Village." Furthermore, the American military seized the best buildings. Nagoya Public Hall was transformed into a place for the Americans to watch "leg shows."

Not far northeast of Nagoya, the US military built an airfield on fertile farmland – the infamous US Air Force base in Komaki. Following the American soldiers came countless dance halls, brothels, and hordes of "pan-pan girls." Vast swathes of sacred Japanese land were defiled, and thousands of decent women were violated! These same American soldiers, indulging in debauchery day and night, recklessly drove cars on the streets, killing people without consequence, shielded by "extraterritorial rights." Their airplanes also flew erratically, often crashing. This year alone, there have been four American aircraft accidents in Nagoya, damaging four residences, 300 tsubo of rice paddies, and an oil storage tank, injuring two residents.

After the US military occupied Nagoya, like flies spreading cholera, American lifestyle staples such as pinball parlors, nude dances, and films promoting killing techniques became popular here. In the early years after the war, the city had 60,000 pinball machines, averaging one for every four households. At that time, the streets and alleys were filled with the "pitter-patter" of the machines, attracting tens of thousands of people to this open gambling den. At night, under the colorful neon lights, hordes of "wild prostitutes" paraded the streets.

The American lifestyle corrupted many, but it also educated the people of Nagoya. Many who were initially seduced by the American lifestyle gradually awakened. Now, the number of pinball machines in the city has decreased by more than 90%. Sakae-machi, once almost entirely filled with pinball parlors, now features many legitimate businesses. The flamboyant floral shirts worn by many young people in the past – imitating the style of American soldiers – are now rarely seen on Japanese people. The "magic" of nude dances is also weakening, largely relegated to remote corners.

This June, the long-awaited event for the citizens of Nagoya finally came to fruition: the public hall was returned to its function as a public auditorium. Workers happily repaired the doors and windows damaged by the Americans and repainted the hall. This brown building located in Tsuruma Park, after renovation, looks particularly beautiful and majestic amidst the lush greenery. After the people of Nagoya reclaimed it from the American military, they first used it to welcome the Chinese Peking Opera Troupe. The Peking Opera artists' wonderful dances and melodious songs added splendor to the public hall. In particular, Mei Lanfang's performance as Yang Guifei captivated the audience, transporting them to a dreamlike celestial realm.

Speaking of the second joyous event, there is no end to the stories of friendship between the Chinese and Japanese people.

Take Yang Guifei, for example. Since 1313, there has been a Japanese legend that during the reign of Emperor Xuanzong of the Tang Dynasty, in order to foster good relations with China, the deity of Atsuta Grand Shrine in Nagoya descended to China and transformed into the beautiful Yang Guifei. After Guifei's death, the Japanese built a Yang Guifei temple at Atsuta Shrine and have preserved it to this day.

Besides this legend, there are also many true stories. During our visit to Nagoya, we saw the names "Jinpucho," "Jinpu Junior High School," and "Jinpu Swimming Pool." According to the "Nagoya Historical Sites and Scenic Spots Chronicle," "Jinpu's" real name was Zhang Jinpu, a Chinese man from the Ming Dynasty, who was a highly skilled doctor. In the mid-seventeenth century, he was recruited to Nagoya and was loved and respected by the local people. At the time, his residence was called "Mount Jinpu." After Zhang Jinpu's death, the local people built a祠堂 (ancestral hall) for him, sculpted his statue, and worshiped him as a Yakushi (healing buddha).

In Nagoya, there are also the ruins of the former residence of Chen Yuanbin. Chen Yuanbin was also a Chinese man from the Ming Dynasty, who was recruited to Nagoya and became the originator of "Kito-ryu Judo." He was also a skilled potter. The pottery he fired was highly valued by the local people and called "Genpin Yaki." It is said that Nagoya's famous product, "Senbei" (rice crackers), was also introduced by him.

Nagoya not only has old ties with China, but also had close trade relations with China. In 1937, Nagoya's sales to China accounted for approximately 40% of its total annual exports. After the war, Nagoya's trade relations with China were obstructed by the American "embargo" policy and were interrupted for several years. However, in the past two years, trade exchanges have begun to develop again. In 1955, it exported 20,000 spindles of textile machinery to China, as well as some wool textiles, timber, and machinery. According to Mr. Fukuda of the Japan International Trade Promotion Association's Tokai General Bureau, China has ordered dozens of wooden boats from this area, and if they can obtain the permission of the Japanese government soon, the boats can be delivered to China by the end of autumn this year. He also said that the business community here is very eager to be friendly with China and develop trade. He gave an example: since the Chinese trade delegation visited Japan last year, the number of members of the Tokai General Bureau has more than doubled (currently there are 80 member companies).

During the Chinese Peking Opera Troupe's visit to Japan, they were warmly welcomed by the local people. The Mayor of Nagoya City, the Vice Governor of Aichi Prefecture, the Governor of Gifu Prefecture, and the Mayor of Yuyama City personally came forward to host them. Celebrities from the literary and art circles, young students, women, and business people visited the hotel to pay their respects. They were extremely interested in everything about China and told their wishes to their Chinese friends. Mr. Ohashi said that he plans to open a Chinese bookstore to introduce China's excellent culture to the Japanese people. Mr. Aoyama, a potter, said that he must go to Jingdezhen, Jiangxi, to appreciate the famous porcelain production area.

When the Chinese Peking Opera Troupe left Nagoya, the people who came to see them off were reluctant to part with them one by one. Among the crowd was a young Japanese lady named Tomiko Oishi. She was one of the guides for the Peking Opera Troupe's tour of Nagoya and also came to the station that day to bid farewell. Upon parting, she said, "How happy and fortunate we were when you were here! After you leave, Nagoya will be lonely. But the feelings bubbling within us will not calm down until you come again."

    双喜临门
    本报记者　裴达
    六月里，日本第三大都市——名古屋发生了两件喜事：被美军强占十多年的公会堂，重新回到日本人民的手里；就在这个公用大厅，名古屋市民欣赏了中国京剧代表团的精彩表演。
    提起头一桩喜事，许多市民总要把十多年的苦难叙述一番。
    名古屋建立在日本三大平原之一的浓尾平原上，南面临近伊势湾。市内拥有各种现代工业，特别是飞机制造业在战时有了飞跃的发展。战后，美国占领军看上了这个地方。在市中心，美国炸弹的弹坑还没有凉下来，美军就在那里修建了军官住宅，占地十六万五千平方公尺。“严禁日本人入内”的大牌子，阻塞了四面八方的交通，妨碍着市政建设的发展。当地人给它起个恰如其分的名字，叫作“阿美利加村”。此外，美军还霸占了最好的楼房。名古屋公会堂就变成了美国佬看“大腿舞”的地方。
    在名古屋市东北不远的地方，美军在肥沃的农田上修了飞机场——这就是臭名远扬的美军小牧空军基地。紧跟着美国大兵而来的是，数不尽的舞厅、妓馆和成群结队的“乓乓女郎”。大片的日本神圣土地被沾污，成千的良家妇女遭蹂躏！就是这些日夜荒淫的美兵，在大街上乱开汽车，轧死了人不偿命，反正他们有“治外法权”的保护；他们在天上开飞机，也是混头昏脑地乱窜，经常发生坠机事件。今年以来，仅在名古屋一地就有四架美机闯了祸，四所市民住宅、三百坪水田和一座贮油槽遭了殃，并且有两个居民受了伤。
    美军占领名古屋之后，好似苍蝇传染霍乱一样，美国生活方式中不可缺少的弹子房、裸体舞、宣扬杀人技术的影片等等，就在这里流行起来。战后最初几年，全市曾有打弹子机六万台，平均每四户人家就有一台。那时，大街小巷一片“劈里啪拉”的响声，上万人被吸引在这公开的赌博场里。一到夜晚，五颜六色的霓虹灯下，成群的“野妓”招摇过市。
    美国生活方式糟蹋了很多人，同时也教育了名古屋的人们。许多为美国生活方式所迷惑的人，渐渐又清醒过来了。现在，全市弹子机已经减了90％多。以前几乎满街都是弹子房的荣町，现在出现了许多正当的商业。过去许多青年人所穿的妖艳花衫——这是仿照美国大兵的样子做的，目前在日本人身上已经非常少见了。裸体舞的“魔力”也在减弱，大都被排挤到偏僻的角落。
    今年六月，名古屋市民等待多年的事终于实现了，公会堂又重新变成了公用大礼堂。工人们满怀高兴地修补了被美国人破坏的门窗，粉刷了大厅。这个座落在鹤舞公园的棕色大楼，经过修理之后，在万绿丛中显得分外美观而雄伟。名古屋人民把它从美军手里收回之后，第一次使用它接待了中国京剧代表团。京剧艺术家们表演的美妙的舞蹈，悦耳的歌声，使得公会堂锦上添花。特别是由梅兰芳扮演的杨贵妃的歌舞，使观众陶醉在梦幻般的仙界之中了。
    谈起第二桩喜事，中日人民的友情说不完。
    就拿杨贵妃来说，从1313年日本就有这样的传说：在唐朝玄宗年间，日本为了和中国要好，就由名古屋的热田大明神下凡于中国，化身为美女杨贵妃。贵妃死后，日本人就在热田神宫修建了杨贵妃庙，并且把它保存到今天。
    在这个传说之外，也有不少真人真事。这次到名古屋，我们见到了“振甫町”、“振甫中学”和“振甫游泳池”的名称。据“名古屋史迹名胜纪要”所载的“振甫”本名张振甫，中国明朝人，是一位非常高明的医生。十七世纪中叶，他被招聘来到名古屋，受到当地人民的爱戴和尊敬。当时他的住处被称为“振甫山”。张振甫死后，当地人民为他修建了祠堂，塑了他的像，供奉他为药师。
    在名古屋还有“陈元赟”故居遗迹。陈元赟也是中国明朝人，被招聘来名古屋后，成了“起倒流柔道”的鼻祖。他还是制陶能手。他烧的陶器受到当地人民的珍重，称作“元赟烧”。现今名古屋的名产“煎饼”，据说也是他的传授。
    名古屋不但和中国有老交情，而且和中国有过密切的贸易关系。1937年，名古屋出售给中国的商品，约占全年输出总额的40％。战后，名古屋和中国的贸易关系，遭到美国‘禁运’政策的阻挠，曾经中断数年。但是，最近两年来，贸易往来又有了开展。1955年，它向中国输出了两万纱锭的纺织机，还输出了一些毛织品和木材、机械。据日本国际贸易促进协会东海总局的福田先生谈：中国已向此地订购数十只木船，如果他们能早日得到日本政府的许可，今年秋末即可把船送到中国。他还说：此地工商界很希望和中国友好，发展贸易。他举了一个例子：自从去年中国贸易代表团来日之后，东海总局的会员就增加了一倍多（目前有会员八十个公司）。
    中国访日京剧代表团在名古屋期间，受到当地人民的热烈欢迎。名古屋市市长、爱知县副知事、岐阜县知事和尤山市市长等亲自出面招待。文学艺术界的名人、青年学生、妇女以及工商界人士，纷纷到旅馆来访问。他们对中国的一切都极感兴趣，并且把自己的心愿告诉给中国的友人。大桥先生说，他准备开设中文书店，把中国的优良文化介绍给日本人民。制陶业的青山先生说，他一定要到江西景德镇，去鉴赏著名的磁器产地。
    中国京剧代表团离开名古屋的时候，送行的人们一个个依依不舍，人群之中有一位年轻日本小姐，名字叫大石富美子。她是京剧代表团游览名古屋时的向导之一，那一天也到车站来欢送。临分手的时候，她说：“你们在这里的时候，我们是多末愉快，多末幸福！你们走了，名古屋就要寂寞了。可是，我们沸腾着的心情，直到你们再来的时候也不会平静下来。”
