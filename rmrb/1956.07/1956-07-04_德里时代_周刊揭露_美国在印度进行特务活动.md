Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, July 3rd. The "Delhi Times" weekly reported on July 1st that various official and non-official American institutions in India are greatly intensifying their activities. The report pointed out: "Of particular note is the so-called Democratic Research Bureau, which has already gained some very bad notoriety among intellectuals in Bombay."

The "Delhi Times" weekly reported that this organization was established in November 1950 "at the initiative and with the active participation of the former U.S. Consul General in Bombay, Timberlake." In addition to its headquarters in Bombay, the organization also established a branch in Madras in 1952.

The report added that the Democratic Research Bureau, from its very first day, has mainly relied on "U.S. Embassy subsidies received through the USIS in Bombay" and funding from American companies operating in India to sustain itself. "Representatives of these companies decided at a meeting last year that each company would give the Democratic Research Bureau 1,500 to 6,000 rupees per month in the form of grants."

The report further stated that the Democratic Research Bureau is vigorously engaged in sabotage activities, and among its various activities are groups working with students, lawyers, filmmakers, and others. The organization also has many groups, such as the Soviet Group, the China Group, the Military Group, the News Group, and the Communications Group, and it is specifically equipped with a group of reporters whose job is to fabricate and disseminate materials aimed at opposing the Indian government's domestic policies, especially plans and development that are against the state-owned portion of the Indian economy.

Another major activity of this organization is to obstruct the development of friendly relations between India and the Soviet Union and other People's Democratic countries. It once tried desperately to undermine the agreement between India and the Soviet Union regarding the steel plant. During the visit of Soviet leaders to India last year, the Democratic Research Bureau directed certain Indian newspapers to slander India's foreign policy.

The report said that this organization also carries out other activities, such as collecting materials on national institutions, armed forces, public opinion, political parties, and industrial enterprises.

The report further pointed out that these activities are contrary to the interests of India and are dangerous to the development of India as a free and sovereign nation.

    “德里时代”周刊揭露
    美国在印度进行特务活动
    新华社新德里3日电　“德里时代”周刊七月一日报道，美国在印度的各种官方和非官方机构正在大大加紧它们的活动。报道指出：“尤其值得注意的是所谓民主调查局，这个机构已经在孟买的知识分子中间得到了一些很坏的名声。”
    “德里时代”周刊报道，这个机构是“在前美国驻孟买总领事丁伯莱克的倡议和积极参与下”在1950年11月成立的。除了设在孟买的总局以外，这个机构还在1952年在马德拉斯成立了分局。
    报道又说，民主调查局从成立的第一天起，主要就是靠“通过孟买的美新处领到的美国大使馆津贴”和美国在印度经营的一些公司的资助而维持的。“这些公司的代表们在去年举行的一次会议上决定，每家公司将以赠款的形式每月给民主调查局一千五百到六千卢比。”
    报道又说，民主调查局大力进行破坏活动，在它的各种活动中间有向学生、律师、电影工作者和其他人等进行工作的小组。这个机构还设有很多组，像苏联组、中国组、军事组、新闻组和通讯组等，它并且专门配备一批记者，他们的工作是捏造和传播目的在于反对印度政府的国内政策、特别是反对印度经济的国营部分的计划和发展的材料。
    这个机构另一项主要活动是阻挠印度同苏联及其他人民民主国家的友好关系的发展。它曾经一度竭力企图破坏印度和苏联缔结关于钢铁厂的协定。在去年苏联领袖访问印度期间，民主调查局指使某些印度报纸对印度外交政策大肆污蔑。
    报道说，这个机构还进行其他的活动，像收集关于国家机构、武装部队、舆论、政党和工业企业的材料。
    报道进一步指出，这些活动是违反印度的利益的，并且对于印度作为自由的主权国家的发展来说是危险的。
