    Beijing Industrial and Commercial Circles Amateur Political School Students Showed Positive Performance in Their Work After Studying

    (Our report) The Beijing Industrial and Commercial Circles Amateur Political School, which started in March, concluded its first semester in early July. The school's more than 1,200 students are mostly backbone members of the industrial and commercial sectors. Among them are industrialists and businessmen in their seventies and young people in their twenties. This semester, they studied historical materialism, the first two chapters of the history of social development, and the principles of socialist enterprise management. Through study, the students theoretically understood the principle that labor creates the world, criticized the exploiting class's ideas of despising labor and the working people, and at the same time gained a further understanding of the prospects of socialism.

    Due to the improvement of ideological understanding, many people have shown positive performance in their work. For example, some students originally had the work attitude of "not seeking merit, but seeking no demerit." After studying, they understood that they should transform themselves into new people in their work and labor. Therefore, they became more active in their work and were awarded the title of advanced worker in the enterprise. Among the students, 180 people won individual or collective awards in the socialist labor emulation. (Lian)

    北京工商界业余政治学校学员
    学习以后工作有了积极表现
    本报讯　三月间开学的北京市工商界业余政治学校，在七月上旬结束第一学期。这个学校的一千二百多名学员，绝大部分是工商界的骨干分子。其中有七十高龄的工商业者，也有二十岁的青年。这个学期他们学习了历史唯物论、社会发展史的第一、二两章和社会主义企业经营管理原则。通过学习，学员们从理论上懂得了劳动创造世界的道理，批判了轻视劳动和轻视劳动人民的剥削阶级思想，同时对社会主义的前途有了进一步的认识。
    由于思想认识的提高，许多人在工作中有了积极的表现。如有的学员原来的工作态度是“不求有功，但求无过”，学习以后，懂得自己应该在工作中和劳动中改造成为新人，因此，工作积极了，在企业中获得了先进工作者的称号。学员中有一百八十人，在社会主义劳动竞赛中，获得了个人奖或集体奖。　（联）
