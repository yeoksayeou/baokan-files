Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, 26th. In the Dulong River Valley between the Gaoligong Mountains and the Dulongka Mountains in Yunnan Province, more than 1,000 mu of paddy fields have appeared. These were opened up by the Dulong people, who had never grown rice before, during this year's spring plowing.

The Dulong people in Yunnan Province number only over two thousand. In the past few years, they have received a large number of iron farm tools, seeds, and tens of thousands of catties of rice distributed free of charge by the People's Government. They have also learned how to divert water to open fields, plow the land, and transplant seedlings from the Han and Lisu farmers who came to teach paddy field farming techniques.

For a long time in the past, the Dulong people only used very backward tools for production. Many people lived their whole lives without ever eating rice; but this year, every household can eat rice.

    独龙人第一次种水稻
    新华社昆明26日电　在云南省高黎贡山和担当力卡山之间的毒龙河谷里，出现了一千多亩稻田，这是从来没有种过稻谷的独龙人今年春耕的时候开辟的。
    云南省的独龙人只有两千多人。几年来，他们得到了人民政府无偿发放的大量铁制农具，籽种和几万斤大米，他们还向前去传授水田耕作技术的汉族和傈僳族农民学会了引水开田、犁地栽秧。
    在过去长远的年代里，独龙人都只用很落后的工具进行生产。许多人活到老，没有吃过大米；而在今年，家家户户都可以吃到大米了。
