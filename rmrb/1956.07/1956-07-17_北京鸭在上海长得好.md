Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, July 15th. Peking ducks, raised on a large scale in Shanghai for the first time, now weigh up to two pounds each. In half a month, they will enter the phase of being force-fed in the sheds. Around the end of August, many restaurants in Shanghai will have fat, authentic Peking roast duck available.

According to the plan of the Shanghai branch of the China Food Company, more than 30,000 Peking breeding ducks are being raised in Shanghai this year. Since late May, more than ten thousand ducklings have entered the farms. Some of these ducks are small ducks ordered from Suzhou, and some are hatched in Shanghai from eggs transported from Tianjin. Peking ducks in Suzhou have been breeding locally for several years and have become accustomed to the southern climate; Peking ducks from Tianjin are experiencing southern life for the first time. However, both batches of Peking ducks are growing well. The keepers take them to swim in the small river every day and feed and rest them according to schedule. The current survival rate is around 95%.

The head of the breeding section of the Shanghai Food Company said that the company also plans to select several thousand strong ducks from this batch as breeding ducks to expand reproduction. It is expected that the Peking ducks raised in Shanghai next year, in addition to supplying citizens for consumption, can also be processed into frozen ducks for export in large quantities.

    北京鸭在上海长得好
    新华社上海15日电　第一次在上海大规模饲养的北京鸭，最大的现在已经有两斤重，半个月以后，就要进入归棚填鸭阶段，大约在八月底左右，上海许多酒楼菜馆里，即将有肥美的真正北京烤鸭上市了。
    根据中国食品公司上海市公司的计划，今年在上海饲养的北京种鸭子有三万多只。自五月下旬以来，已经有一万数千只雏鸭进了饲养场。这些鸭子，有一部分是从苏州订购来的小鸭，一部分是从天津运来的种蛋在上海孵化的。苏州的北京鸭在当地繁殖有好几年了，已经习惯于南方气候；天津来的北京鸭，是第一次过南方生活。但是这两批北京鸭生长都很好。饲养员每天带它们到小河里游水，按规定时间进食和休息。目前的养活率都在95％左右。
    上海市食品公司饲养科科长说，公司还准备从这批鸭子中，挑选几千只体格强壮的作为种鸭扩大繁殖。预计明年在上海饲养的北京填鸭，除了供应市民食用外，还可大量加工成冻鸭出口。
