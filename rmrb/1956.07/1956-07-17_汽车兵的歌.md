The Song of the Truck Driver
Liu Gengxin, Technician of a Certain Unit of the People's Liberation Army

	Through forests, over high mountains,
	My truck, runs so happily;
	Runs, runs, always flying forward!
	So many miles, so many bends,
	Ran through so many highways;
	So many pounds, so many items,
	The goods I transport are countless.
	There are guns, there are bullets,
	There is flour, canned goods and cigarettes...
	The front lines call for what they need,
	Before the words are even finished, I can
	Deliver them right before their eyes.
	So many years, so many days,
	Spring flowers, winter snow, it's impossible to count,
	The more I run, the happier I feel,
	The more I run, the more skilled I become.
	The sun paints half the mountain red,
	My body is already sweating;
	Run fast! Run fast! Run fast!
	The front lines are waiting for me to transport high-altitude artillery shells!
	Ah! The position can already be seen,
	Comrades are waving and shouting at me,
	Run fast! Run fast! Run fast!
	I want to see enemy planes with smoke coming out of their asses diving into the sea!

    汽车兵的歌
    解放军某部技工　刘更新穿过了森林，爬过了高山，我的车子，跑呀，跑的欢；跑呀，跑呀，一直飞向前！多少里路呵，多少个湾，跑过了多少公路线；多少斤呀，多少件，我运的货物数不完。有枪炮，有子弹，有面粉、罐头和香烟……。前线说声需要啥，话没落音我就能
    送到眼跟前。多少年呀，多少天，春花，冬雪没法算，越跑我心里越高兴，越跑我的技术越熟练。太阳涂红了半边山，我的身上已经跑出汗；快跑！快跑！快快跑呀！前线正等我运的高射大炮弹！啊！阵地已经能看见，同志们正向我招手又呼喊，快跑！快跑！快快跑呀！我要看敌机屁股冒烟往海里钻！
