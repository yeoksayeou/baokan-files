Xinhua News Agency, July 14th: The unified national college entrance examinations will be held simultaneously in 120 examination districts across the country from the 15th to the 17th. Registration work in all examination districts concluded on the 14th.

    To facilitate participation in the examination by young people from all areas, the number of examination districts this year has increased by a quarter compared to last year. In addition to the originally stipulated examination districts, the National College Entrance Examination Committee has added more than 40 examination districts and examination halls in areas with inconvenient transportation and remote regions. The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region originally had only two examination districts, Hohhot and Ulanhot, but now has added four examination halls in Chifeng, Tongliao, Hailar, and Baotou. In the Northwest region, four examination halls have also been added in Yan'an, Yinchuan, and other places with inconvenient transportation.

    The enrollment work has received support from local transportation, grain departments, and Communist Youth League organizations. Institutions of higher learning in Lanzhou, Xi'an, and other places, and Communist Youth League organizations in Suzhou, Nanjing, and other places have organized "Candidate Service Groups" to help solve candidates' problems with food, lodging, medical care, and other issues.

    Grading of the candidates' papers will begin on the 16th. The National College Entrance Examination Committee has hired nearly ten thousand teachers from colleges and some senior middle schools across the country to serve as examination paper graders and participate in the grading work.
