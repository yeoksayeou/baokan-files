Yong'an Company Receives Over Sixty Thousand Customers

　　Early in the morning, as the doors of the largest joint state-private department store in China—the joint state-private Yong'an Company on Nanjing East Road in Shanghai—opened, crowds of customers poured into the store. At one end of the ground floor, many customers stood in layers around the candy department counter, trying the newly added food—fragrant and sweet osmanthus sweet fermented rice. In the past, the supply of sweet fermented rice was generally only around 300 jin; today, in order to receive more customers, it has been increased to 600 jin. Nearby, the summer refreshment counters for frozen mung bean cake and fruit cake are also very popular with customers. These are all new products recently trial-produced by Yong'an Company. To meet the needs of customers, the company has added more than 6,300 new commodities, including bath tubs, foot basins, and flat-heeled colorful wooden slippers, which were never sold before.

　　A customer surnamed Xu, who came all the way from a rural area in Suzhou to purchase goods at the company, contentedly bought a pair of light boots for his child and excitedly said to the salesperson: "These boots are very good, and they are not easily damaged by mud and water. People in our village all like them very much."

　　In the shopping area on the third floor of the company, many parents were bringing their children to admire the various toys displayed in the toy counters.

　　"Mom, look, the plane is flying!" several children shouted happily, pointing to a silver clockwork plane hovering in the air. This is a sales promotion method used by the employees of the toy department to let customers know the performance and how to play with various toys.

　　On this day, Yong'an Company received more than 60,000 customers and completed a business volume of more than 55,000 yuan. (Xu Yisheng)

    永安公司接待了六万多顾客
    早晨，当中国最大的公私合营百货商店——上海南京东路上的公私合营永安公司的门一打开，一群群的顾客就涌进了商场。在底层商场的一端，有许多顾客一层层的围立在糖果部柜台旁边，尝试着新近增添的食品——又香又甜的桂花甜酒酿。往日，酒酿的供应量一般只在三百斤左右；今天，为了接待更多的顾客，就增加到六百斤。附近，冰冻的绿豆糕、水果蛋糕等夏令细点柜台，也很受顾客欢迎。这些都是永安公司最近试制的新产品。为了顾客的需要，这个公司共增加了六千三百多种新商品，连过去从来没有经营过的浴桶、脚盆、平跟彩花木拖鞋，现在也出售了。
    一位远从苏州农村来到公司购买物品的徐姓顾客，满意地给自己的孩子买了双轻便靴，兴奋地对营业员说：“这种靴很好，沾泥浸水都不容易损坏。我们乡里人都很喜欢它。”
    在公司三楼的商场里，许多爸爸妈妈们带着孩子在观赏陈列在玩具柜台里的各式各样的玩具。
    “妈妈，你看飞机飞啦！”有几个孩子高兴地喊着，用手指着一架正在凌空盘旋的银色发条飞机。这是玩具部职工运用表演推销法，让顾客们知道各种玩具的性能和玩的方法。
    这一天，永安公司一共接待了六万多名顾客，成交了五万五千多元的营业额。　（徐义生）
