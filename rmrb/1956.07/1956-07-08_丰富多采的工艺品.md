Rich and Colorful Handicrafts

Increase Production of Yu Ping Flutes

Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang: Yu Ping flutes, a famous and unique Chinese handicraft, are expanding production.

The Yu Ping County Flute Production Cooperative in Guizhou Province recently accepted a task to produce 1,500 pairs of flutes for the country's export. The cooperative members have high morale, and produced more than 700 pairs of flutes in April and May alone.

Yu Ping flutes became famous more than 300 years ago during the Wanli period of the Ming Dynasty. These flutes are made from a fine, tall, high-quality bamboo produced in Yu Ping County. They have pure scales, a beautiful sound, and are carved with delicate dragons, phoenixes, flowers, and other beautiful patterns, as well as famous poems from ancient and modern times, which are rich in national style. They won the silver medal at the London International Handicraft Exhibition in 1913 and the gold medal at the Panama International Handicraft Exhibition in 1923.

Tianshui Lacquerware Designs Updated

Our newspaper's Lanzhou dispatch: The Tianshui Lacquerware Production Cooperative has recently designed and trial-produced 20 new products. These include hanging screens, desktops, fruit plates, vases, and octagonal food boxes. These new products retain the characteristics of meticulous processing and durability, and are also novel in style, bright in color, and rich in national characteristics. In addition to hanging screens which can be admired as decorations, the remaining new products have practical value.

Tianshui lacquerware, famous in the Northwest, is a very complex handicraft. The production of an object requires nearly 20 processes. The colored paintings on it are not painted with a brush, but carved with a knife, and then filled with colored lacquer. Therefore, the colors never fade or peel off, and the colors become more vibrant the longer they are used. Mass production of the new products that have been trial-produced is now being prepared.

Unique Jun Porcelain

Xinhua News Agency, Xuchang: The "Jun Kiln" in Shenhou Town, Yuxian County, one of the famous folk porcelain kilns founded in the early Northern Song Dynasty, recently fired its first kiln of porcelain after being out of production for more than 30 years. This kiln was jointly researched and fired by Lu Guangdong, a 65-year-old "Jun Kiln" veteran technician, and workers from the Shenhou Town No. 1 Porcelain Production Cooperative.

The various types of porcelain that were successfully fired, after appraisal, proved to fully maintain the unique style of Jun porcelain in the past. The porcelain has bright colors, delicate and hard texture, and the glaze has hidden earthworm patterns or dense dot dodder patterns, which are beautiful and durable.

New Ceramic Products in Beijing

Our newspaper reports: A batch of novel in style, beautifully decorated, and slightly milky yellow porcelain tea sets were recently displayed at the China Artists Association, and were well received by visitors. This batch of ceramic products are samples of new products trial-produced by the Ceramics Department of the Craft Art Department of the Central Academy of Fine Arts using alkali alum.

Alkali alum is a kind of porcelain clay from Tangshan, Hebei, with large reserves and low prices. However, it was not valued in the past, and some people mistakenly believed that the finished products made of this titanium-containing porcelain clay were not as blue-white as Jingdezhen porcelain. Even when using this porcelain clay, in order to pursue the effect of Jingdezhen porcelain, it was necessary to add Suzhou clay and expensive metal cobalt oxide, thus increasing the cost. Over the past year, after continuous research and experimentation by the Ceramics Department of the Craft Art Department of the Central Academy of Fine Arts and several excellent technicians sent by the Tangshan Industrial Bureau, it was believed that using this raw material without adding cobalt oxide and Suzhou clay not only resulted in a better artistic effect than the original, but also saved raw materials from other places and cobalt oxide, and the cost was significantly reduced.

Also displayed at the Central Academy of Fine Arts were some terracotta decorative sculptures and utensils. These were trial-produced using Beijing's abundant glazed tile raw materials and traditional production techniques with improvements. These new trial products have enriched the original traditions in terms of color glaze experiments, and have also achieved some new accomplishments. (Chen Qiheng)

Using Machines to Produce Handicrafts

Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou: Some processes in the production of Fuzhou bodiless lacquerware have begun to use machines.

All five bodiless lacquerware craft cooperatives and the joint state-private Fuzhou Bodiless Lacquerware Company have recently installed 31 electric circular product working machines to replace the old and laborious wooden lathes of the past. From now on, when manufacturing many kinds of circular bodiless lacquerware such as cups, pots, bottles, and thermos shells, in addition to processes such as bodiless shaping, coloring, lacquer painting, and decoration, the remaining 16 processes such as turning the blank, applying gray, grinding the gray, and polishing can all be carried out on circular product working machines. According to preliminary statistics from various user units, after using machines for processes such as turning the blank and applying gray, production efficiency has increased by about 100%, and product quality has also improved.

Wang Shi, director of the Fuzhou Handicraft Professional Federation, told reporters today: "The adoption of this machine in the Fuzhou bodiless lacquerware process has undergone careful research and testing. The test results proved that the use of machines does not affect the unique characteristics, style, and various advantages of this unique craft. According to the current situation, after using machines, not only can the output of circular products of bodiless lacquerware in the city increase by more than 50%, but also workers can be freed from heavy labor and devote themselves to improving product quality."

    丰富多采的工艺品
    增产玉屏箫
    据新华社贵阳电　中国著名的特种手工艺品——玉屏箫正在扩大生产。
    贵州省玉屏县箫笛生产合作社，不久前接受了为国家生产出口箫一千五百对的任务。社员们生产情绪很高，仅在四、五两月份就制出七百多对箫。
    玉屏箫在三百多年前的明朝万历年间就开始出名。这种箫是由玉屏县出产的一种细高的优质竹管制成的，音阶纯正，声音优美，并且雕刻着精致的龙、凤、花卉等美丽图案和古今的著名诗歌，富有民族风格，曾在1913年获得伦敦国际手工业品展览会的银质奖章和1923年巴拿马国际手工业品展览会的金质奖章。
    天水雕漆花样翻新
    本报兰州电　天水市雕漆生产合作社最近设计和试制出20种新产品。其中有挂屏、桌面、果盘、花瓶、八角食盒等。这些新产品保持了加工细致、经久耐用的特点，而且式样新颖，色彩鲜艳，富有民族特色。除挂屏可作为装饰品供人欣赏外，其余的新产品都有实用价值。
    天水雕漆，驰名西北，是一种加工很复杂的手工艺品。一个器物的制成，要经过近20道工序。上面的彩画不是用笔绘的，而是用刀刻过后，把混有颜色的漆嵌填上去。所以永不变色，永不剥落，使用愈久色彩愈鲜艳。现在试制成的新产品正在着手准备大量生产。
    风格独特的钧瓷
    据新华社许昌电　创始于北宋初年的著名民间瓷窑之一——禹县神垕镇“钧窑”，在停产三十多年后，最近又烧出了第一窑瓷器。这一窑是由一位六十五岁的“钧窑”老技工卢光东和神垕镇第一瓷器生产合作社的工人共同研究烧制的。
    烧制成功的各类瓷器，经过鉴定证明完全保持了过去钧瓷所具有的独特风格。瓷器的色泽鲜艳，质地细腻坚硬，釉内隐有蚯蚓纹或密点菟丝纹，美观而且耐用。
    北京的陶瓷新产品
    本报讯　一批式样新颖、装饰美丽、略呈乳黄色的瓷质茶具，最近在中国美术家协会陈列，受到参观者的好评。这批陶瓷产品是中央美术学院工艺美术系陶瓷科用碱矸试制的新产品的样品。
    碱矸是河北唐山的一种瓷土，蕴藏量大，价格便宜，然而过去并不被人重视，有的人错误地认为用这种含有钛的瓷土所制出的成品，不如景德镇瓷的青白，即使在利用这种瓷土时，为了追求景德镇瓷质的效果，也必须掺入苏州土和贵重的金属氧化钴，因此提高了成本。一年以来，经过中央美术学院工艺美术系陶瓷科和唐山工业局派来的几位优秀技工不断研究试验，认为利用这种原料不加氧化钴和苏州土，不但成品的美术效果比原来的好，而且可以节省外地原料和氧化钴，成本显著降低。
    同时陈列在中央美术学院的，还有一部分陶质的装饰雕刻和用具。这是利用北京丰富的琉璃瓦原料和生产的传统技巧，加以改进试制而成的，这些新的试制品，在色釉的试验方面，丰富了原来的传统，也获得了一些新的成就。　　　　　　（陈企衡）
    用机器生产工艺品
    据新华社福州电　生产福州脱胎漆器的部分工序已开始使用机器。
    全市五个脱胎漆器工艺合作社和公私合营福州脱胎漆器公司，最近安装了三十一架电动的圆制品工作机，代替过去的古老费力的木架车床。从此以后，在制造杯、壶、瓶、热水瓶外壳等许多种圆形的脱胎漆器时，除脱胎、上色、漆画、装饰等工序以外，其余如俥坯、上灰、磨灰、磨擦退光等十六道工序都可以在圆制品工作机上进行。据各使用单位的初步统计，俥坯、上灰等工序在使用机器以后，生产效率提高一倍左右，产品质量也有提高。
    福州市工艺品专业联合社主任王实今天对记者说：“在福州脱胎漆器工艺中采用这种机器，曾经经过慎重的研究和试验。试验结果证明，使用机器毫不影响这一独特工艺的特色、风格和各种优点。按目前情况看，使用机器后，不但能使全市脱胎漆器的圆制品产量增加五成以上，而且能使工人从繁重的劳动中解脱出来，致力于提高产品的质量。”
