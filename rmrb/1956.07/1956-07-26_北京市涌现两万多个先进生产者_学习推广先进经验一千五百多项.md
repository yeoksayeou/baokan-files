Xinhua News Agency, 24th. The advanced producer movement in Beijing's industrial enterprises has achieved great success. This was stated by Jia Tingsan, Minister of the Industrial Department of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, at the expanded cadre meeting of Beijing's industrial enterprises held on the 23rd.

Jia Tingsan said that since January of this year, more than 20,000 advanced producers have emerged in Beijing's industrial enterprises. Thanks to their efforts and the efforts of all employees, the production plan for the first half of the year was completed better than in any previous first half of the year. According to statistics from state-owned, local state-owned, cooperative-run, and joint state-private industrial enterprises, the total production value plan for the first half of this year was completed by 111.9%, an increase of 20% compared to the same period last year.

Jia Tingsan said that one of the most important achievements of the advanced producer movement is that "learning from the advanced" and "emulating the advanced" has become the prevailing trend. According to the statistics of 153 units in half a year, more than 1,500 advanced experiences have been learned and promoted, including more than 200 experiences from the Soviet Union and people's democratic countries, more than 800 experiences from fraternal factories and mines, and more than 500 experiences from this unit. In addition, more than 1,200 employees from more than 100 factories and mines in Beijing have been sent to fraternal factories and mining enterprises across the country to learn from their experience in the first half of the year. The promotion of these advanced experiences has guaranteed the completion of the production plan for the first half of the year.

Jia Tingsan analyzed the problems in the advanced producer movement, such as the fact that the policy of more, faster, better, and more economical has not been fully implemented in Beijing, the work of promoting advanced experience has not been regularized, the safety work has not been done well, and the bureaucratic style of enterprise leadership has not been completely overcome. After these shortcomings, he asked all factories and mining enterprises to conduct a general inspection recently to affirm achievements, find shortcomings, and improve them, so that the advanced producer movement can be carried out more widely and deeply.

    北京市涌现两万多个先进生产者
    学习推广先进经验一千五百多项
    新华社24日讯　北京工业企业中的先进生产者运动已经获得了很大成绩。这是中共北京市委工业部部长贾庭三在二十三日举行的北京工业企业扩大干部会议上说的。
    贾庭三说，从今年一月以来，北京各工业企业中涌现出两万多个先进生产者。由于他们和全体职工的努力，上半年的生产计划完成得比以往任何一年的上半年都好。据国营、地方国营、合作社营和公私合营工业统计，今年上半年完成生产总值计划的111.9％，比去年同期提高了20％。
    贾庭三说，先进生产者运动中最重要的成果之一，是“学习先进”、“向先进看齐”已经成为风气。据153个单位半年的统计，已经学习和推广了一千五百多项先进经验，其中有苏联和人民民主国家的经验二百多项，兄弟厂矿的经验八百多项，本单位的经验五百多项。此外，北京一百多个厂矿上半年还派出了一千二百个职工，到全国兄弟厂矿企业中去学习经验。这些先进经验的推广，保证了上半年生产计划的完成。
    贾庭三分析了多、快、好、省的方针在北京贯彻执行得不全面，推广先进经验的工作没有经常化，安全工作做得不好，企业领导的官僚主义还没有完全克服等先进生产者运动中的问题以后，要求各厂矿企业在最近普遍作一次检查，肯定成绩，找出缺点，加以改进，使先进生产者运动更广泛、更深入地开展起来。
