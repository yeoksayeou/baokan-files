Xinhua News Agency, Washington, July 20th: According to a statement released by the US State Department on July 19th, the US government has decided to withdraw its proposal to assist Egypt in building the Aswan High Dam.

In December 1955, the United States, Britain, and the World Bank jointly proposed assisting Egypt in building a high dam on the Nile at Aswan. The State Department said in a statement yesterday that developments in the seven months since the proposal was made "have been unfavorable to the success of the project, and the US government has concluded that participation in the project is not practically feasible under the current circumstances."

While withdrawing the US proposal, the State Department stated that the United States "remains deeply concerned" about the development of the Nile. "It is prepared to consider, when appropriate and upon acceptance of the requirements of the countries along the river, what steps can be taken to more effectively utilize the water resources of the Nile."

United Press International, Washington, July 19th: The sudden withdrawal by the United States of its proposal to help Egypt build the Aswan High Dam is apparently due to Egypt's dealings with the Soviet Union. UPI says that Washington officials believe this action is a "deliberate gamble" by the United States. "Some worry that this may force Egypt to turn to Russia for help in building the dam, thereby pushing it into the Soviet camp."

Xinhua News Agency, July 20th: According to Reuters, London, following the United States, Britain also announced today that it is withdrawing its proposal to finance the construction of the Aswan Dam on the upper Nile River in Egypt.

A British Foreign Office spokesman said, "We also consider it impractical to participate in this project under the current circumstances."

Reuters said that British Foreign Office Undersecretary Cassia will likely "explain (Britain's) willingness to consider a plan when the situation is more favorable" in a notice to Egyptian Ambassador to Britain, Abdel Seidou, today.

Xinhua News Agency, July 21st: Cairo News: Egyptian newspapers unanimously condemned the US and British action of withdrawing their proposals to help Egypt build the Aswan Dam.

The "Egyptian Financial Market News" pointed out that the United States' refusal to help build the Aswan Dam "was caused by Egypt's insistence on not accepting any political conditions in exchange for Western aid." The newspaper said: "With the cancellation of Western aid, Egypt is now completely free to accept other proposals that do not carry political conditions."

"Cairo News" added that this clearly shows the imperialist exploitation purposes of the United States and Britain when they proposed aid at that time.

A commentary in "The Republic" wrote that Egypt will shatter the aims of imperialism and build this huge dam without foreign interference. The newspaper said that if the United States and Britain believe that Egypt will encounter difficulties as a result of their refusal to provide assistance, "they will be greatly disappointed."

    美英拒绝帮助修建阿斯旺水坝 
    埃及舆论怒斥两国的卑劣手段
    据新华社20日讯　华盛顿消息：据美国国务院七月十九日宣布，美国政府已经决定撤回关于援助埃及修建阿斯旺高水坝的建议。
    美国在1955年12月曾经同英国和世界银行联合建议协助埃及在尼罗河上的阿斯旺建筑一个高水坝。国务院昨天在一项声明中说，建议提出以后七个月的发展“对于这项工程的成功是不利的，美国政府已经得出结论，在目前的情况下参与这项工程不是实际可行的。”
    国务院在撤回美国的建议的同时表示，美国“仍然深切关怀”尼罗河的开发。“它准备在适当的时候和接受沿河国家的要求考虑可以采取什么步骤来更有效地利用尼罗河水力资源”。
    同一天，英国外交部发言人说，英国同意美国国务卿杜勒斯在阿斯旺水坝问题上的立场。他说，英国所提出的建议在原则上仍然有效，但是，由于埃及国内发生了“各样的演变”，就有必要进行更多的讨论了。
    合众社华盛顿七月十九日电说，美国突然撤回它提出的帮助埃及修建阿斯旺高水坝的建议，显然是由于埃及同苏联打交道的缘故。合众社说，华盛顿人士认为，这一作法是美国的一个“有意的冒险”。“有些人担心，这可能迫使埃及转而要求俄国帮助建筑这个水坝，从而把它推进苏联的阵营。”
    新华社20日讯　据路透社伦敦消息，英国继美国之后，也在今天宣布撤回它资助埃及建造尼罗河上游的阿斯旺水坝的建议。
    英国外交部发言人说，“我们也认定在目前情况下，我们参加这个工程是行不通的”。
    路透社说，英国外交部次官卡西亚在今天给埃及驻英国大使阿卜杜勒·塞杜的通知中大概会“说明（英国）愿意在情况较有利的时候考虑一个计划”。
    据新华社21日讯　开罗消息：埃及报纸一致斥责美英撤回帮助埃及修建阿斯旺水坝的建议的行为。
    “埃及金融市场报”指出，美国拒绝帮助修建阿斯旺水坝“是由于埃及坚持不接受任何政治条件以交换西方的援助促成的”。这家报纸说：“撤销了西方的援助，埃及现在完全有自由接受不带有政治条件的其他建议。”
    “开罗报”又说，这就清楚表明，美国和英国当时提出援助建议时的帝国主义剥削的目的。
    “共和国报”的评论写道，埃及将会粉碎帝国主义的目的，在没有外来干预下建筑这座巨大的水坝。这家报纸说，如果美国和英国认为由于它们拒绝给予援助的结果，埃及就会因此遭到困难，“它们将会大大地失望”。
