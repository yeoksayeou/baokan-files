Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, July 6th: The Chelyabinsk Tractor Factory in the Soviet Union recently successfully trial-produced what is currently the largest tractor in the Soviet Union.

This tractor is six meters long and three meters high, almost twice the size of an average tractor. It can travel at a maximum speed of nineteen kilometers per hour, with a maximum tractive force of 22,000 kilograms.

The new tractor has two hundred and fifty horsepower. It is equipped with heating and ventilation equipment, so that its engine can operate normally even in severe cold of minus fifty degrees.

The new tractor is also a "mobile power station." The electricity it generates can drive the combined machinery of a machine tractor station, or supply electricity for lighting to a village with three hundred households.

    二百五十马力大拖拉机
    苏联试制成功
    据新华社莫斯科6日电苏联车里雅宾斯克拖拉机工厂最近试制成功了一台目前苏联最大的拖拉机。
    这台拖拉机有六公尺长，三公尺高，比一般拖拉机差不多大一倍。它每小时最快可以行走十九公里，最高牵引力是二万二千公斤。
    这台新型的拖拉机有二百五十马力。它装有保暖和通风设备，因此，即使在零下五十度的严寒中，它的发动机也能够正常工作。
    新拖拉机也是一台“活动的电力站”。它发出的电力能够带动机器拖拉机站的联动机，或者供给一个有三百户人家的村庄作照明之用。
