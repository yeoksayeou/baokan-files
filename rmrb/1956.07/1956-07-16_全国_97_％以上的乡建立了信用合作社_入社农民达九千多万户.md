    Over 97% of Townships Nationwide Have Established Credit Cooperatives
    Over 90 Million Farmer Households Have Joined
    Xinhua News Agency, 13th -- Over 97% of townships nationwide have established credit cooperatives, with over 91 million farmer households participating, accounting for 77.2% of the total number of farmer households nationwide.
    With the development of the agricultural collectivization movement and rural credit undertakings, the deposit and loan businesses of credit cooperatives across the country have also achieved great success. The funds of credit cooperatives have also grown rapidly. According to the latest statistics from the Head Office of the Agricultural Bank of China, members of credit cooperatives across the country have paid more than 260 million yuan in share capital to the credit cooperatives. The deposit balance reached over 570 million yuan. The loan balance reached over 920 million yuan. Among these loans, more than 50% were used for production expenses.
    The widespread expansion of deposit and loan businesses of credit cooperatives has not only played a significant role in organizing rural funds and supporting the agricultural collectivization movement and agricultural production, but has also achieved great success in acting as an agent for banks in issuing loans and providing financial accounting guidance to agricultural production cooperatives in various regions.

    随着农业合作化运动和农村信用事业的发展，全国各地信用社的存放款业务也获得了很大成绩。信用社的资金也得到了迅速的增长。据中国农业银行总行最近统计，全国各地信用合作社社员向信用社缴纳的股金达两亿六千多万元。存款余额达五亿七千多万元。放款余额达九亿二千多万元。这个放款数字中，用在生产费用方面的占50％以上。
    各地信用社存放业务的广泛展开，不仅在组织农村资金、支援农业合作化运动和农业生产上起了很大作用，同时在代理银行发放贷款和对各地农业生产合作社进行财务会计辅导工作方面也有很大成绩。
