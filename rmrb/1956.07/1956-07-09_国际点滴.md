    Australian Oddity
    June 26th was the coldest day on record in Western Australia. This was followed by a heavy snowstorm, with snow accumulating to a depth of two and a half inches. This is an oddity in Australian history. Previously, Western Australia only saw light snow on the summit of Mount Lofty, located in the south, once every year or two. Snowfall is extremely rare in other parts of Australia.

    Television Poisoning Children
    According to the American "Chicago Sun-Times," crime-related programs on American television broadcasts for children in 1955 tripled compared to 1954. The newspaper cited the main content of a Saturday children's television program as an example:
    9:00 AM: "A man is killed, his body is thrown onto the roof of a truck, transported to the desert, and dumped there." 10:30 AM: "A good man is shot in Texas. Another good man is kidnapped." Noon: "A man is shot and dies in agony." 6:00 PM: "A group of bad guys set fire to a barn." 12:30 AM: "A group of bad guys detonate explosives."

    Many Car Accidents in Seoul
    The reckless driving of American and South Korean military vehicles in Seoul has led to an increase in car accidents compared to last year. From January to May this year, a total of 570 car accidents occurred in Seoul, resulting in 568 casualties. On average, nearly 114 car accidents occurred each month, resulting in nearly 114 casualties. According to the "Dong-A Ilbo," the monthly average last year was 108 car accidents, with 103 casualties.

    澳洲奇事
    六月二十六日是澳洲西部有纪录以来最冷的一天，接着下了一场大风雪，积雪有两英寸半厚。这是澳洲历史上的奇事。以前澳洲西部只有在它的南面的光山山顶每一两年下一次小雪，澳洲其他地方极少下雪。
    毒害儿童的电视
    据美国“芝加哥新闻报”说，1955年，美国的电视广播的儿童节目中，有关犯罪行为的节目比1954 年增加三倍。该报举了一个星期六的儿童电视节目的主要内容为例：
    上午九时：“一个人被杀，他的尸体被抛到货车顶上，运到沙漠去并被抛在那里。”上午十时半：“一个好人在得克萨斯被枪杀。另一个好人被绑架。”中午：“一个人被枪杀，在痛苦中死亡。”下午六时：“一批坏人在谷仓放火。”夜十二时三十分：“一批坏人在爆炸炸药。”
