Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 29th - Shanghai's joint state-private enterprises began distributing private share dividends for the first half of the year at an annual interest rate of five percent, starting from the 27th. On the 27th and 28th, private shareholders of joint ventures and enterprises in industries such as paint manufacturing, pigments, sewing machines, fire-fighting equipment, silk fabric commerce, and woolen yarn commerce received their dividends. Among them, private shareholders of joint venture factories affiliated with the Paint and Pigment Industry Company can receive more than 210,000 yuan in dividends for the first half of the year, a figure equivalent to about 25% of the actual profits received by the private sector of these factories in the six years after liberation. Yong'an Company, which had not distributed dividends or bonuses for eight years, also saw its private shareholders receive dividends this time.

According to the current preparations, joint ventures in fifteen industrial and commercial sectors such as cotton spinning, wool spinning, papermaking, and cigarette manufacturing, as well as more than forty factories that were jointly operated earlier, can also issue dividends before the end of July. In order to simplify the dividend payment procedures and distribute dividends to private shareholders as soon as possible, each specialized company has stipulated that enterprises with working capital can distribute the dividends themselves, while enterprises with insufficient working capital will have their interest funds allocated and distributed by the specialized company.

Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 29th - Joint state-private industrial and commercial enterprises in Tianjin have begun to pay private share dividends for the first half of this year. On the 28th, about 300 private shareholders in joint ventures in industries such as printing and dyeing, oil felt, and hardware wire received interest payments and notices for receiving fixed interest. It is expected that the private share dividends of all joint state-private enterprises will be paid out in August.

According to the person in charge of the Capital Transformation Office of the Tianjin Municipal People's Committee, this dividend distribution work will strive to simplify shareholder registration and dividend payment procedures. Generally, industrial and commercial enterprises that implemented joint state-private ownership during the high tide of socialist transformation in 1956 or earlier will be issued dividends at an annual interest rate of five percent based on the share amount determined by asset verification from January 1st of this year. For a small number of enterprises whose share capital has not been fully verified, dividends can also be issued in advance as appropriate, and adjustments will be made according to the actual situation after the capital is verified in the future.

When handling the registration of private shareholders, private shareholders residing in the city or residing outside the city or abroad but with agents entrusted in the city can have the registration handled by the original private enterprise负责人 (person in charge). If private shareholders are required to submit investment certificates and proof during registration, not only can the original reserved seal, partnership agreement, stock certificate, etc. be used as certificates, but also the partner shareholders or employees of the original private enterprise can provide proof on their behalf. Individual shareholders who are unable to complete registration and obtain dividend certificates before the end of August due to special reasons can also collect dividends later.

    上海天津公私合营企业
    开始发放上半年私股股息
    新华社上海29日电　上海市公私合营企业从二十七日起，按年息五厘发放上半年私股股息。在二十七、二十八日两天里，已经有造漆、颜料、缝纫机、消防器材、绸布商业、绒线商业等行业的合营工厂和企业的私方股东，领到了股息。其中造漆、颜料工业公司所属各合营工厂的私方股东，可以领得上半年股息二十一万多元，这个数字等于这些工厂私方在解放后六年中实得红利的25％左右。已经有八年没有发过股息红利的永安公司，私方股东们这次也拿到了股息。
    根据目前的准备工作情况，棉纺、毛纺、造纸、卷烟等十五个工商行业的合营企业和四十多家合营较早的工厂，也可以在七月底以前发息。各专业公司为了简化付息手续，尽快地把股息发给私股股东，已经规定：有流动资金的企业可自行发放，流动资金不足的企业，由专业公司调拨息金发放。
    新华社天津29日电　天津市公私合营的工商业企业开始发付今年上半年的私股股息。二十八日，印染、油毡、五金线材等合营行业，约有三百多户私方人员分别领到了息金和领取定息的通知单。全部公私合营企业的私股股息，预计在八月份内就可以发付完毕。
    据天津市人民委员会对资改造办公室的负责人说，这次发息工作将力求简化股东登记和发息手续。凡是在1956年社会主义改造高潮中实行公私合营或者在以前实行公私合营的工商业企业，一般都从今年一月一日起按清产核资所确定的股金额发给年利五厘的股息；少数企业的部分股金没有完全核定的也可以酌量先发给股息，等到将来资金核定以后再按实调整。
    在办理私股股东登记的时候，居住在本市的和居住在外埠或国外但在本市委托有代理人的私股股东，都可以由原私营企业负责人承办登记。如果在登记时需要私股股东提出投资证件和证明。不但可以用原留印鉴、合伙契约、股票等作为证件，还可以由合伙股东或者原私营企业职工代为证明。个别股东如因故不能在八月底以前办理登记领取领息凭证，也可以在以后补领股息。
