    Cannot Be Only Cautious and Not Active
    The Party branch of the General Office of the Zhejiang Provincial Public Security Department has not admitted a single new Party member in the past three years. Among the more than 20 members of the Youth League branch of the office, five have already exceeded the age limit for the League, and in another two or three years, the vast majority of the members will be overage. Most of these Youth League members have expressed their desire to join the Party and are actively striving to do so. However, this Party branch has long ignored these comrades who urgently want to join the Party. If these comrades do not yet meet the conditions for joining the Party, then why doesn't the Party branch strengthen their education and training? I hope the Party branch of the General Office of the Zhejiang Public Security Department will examine whether it is being too cautious and not active enough in implementing the Party building policy.　Shen Rensheng

    不能只慎重不积极
    浙江省公安厅办公室党支部三年来没有发展过一个党员，该室青年团支部的二十余名团员中，目前，已有五人超过了团龄，再过上两三年绝大部分团员都将成为超龄团员了。这些青年团员，大部分都提出了入党的要求并在积极争取入党，然而，这个党支部却长期对这些迫切要求入党的同志不加过问。如果说：这些同志还不够入党的条件，那么，党支部为什么又不去对他们加强教育和培养呢？我希望浙江公安厅办公室党支部检查一下，是否在执行建党方针上过于慎重而太不积极了呢。　沈仁生
