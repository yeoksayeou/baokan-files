Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 26th July. Flood control headquarters at all levels, from the special districts to the townships, have been established in the lower reaches of the Yellow River, and a strong flood control force has been organized.

In order to improve the fighting capacity of the flood control teams, the basic flood control teams already formed in the Yellow River areas of Shandong Province have been reorganized. Some of the sick, disabled, old, and weak people have been replaced, and communist party members, communist youth league cadres, and people with flood control experience have been added. At present, various counties along the Yellow River are holding short-term training courses for flood control cadres. According to statistics from Qidong, Jinan and other seven counties and cities, as of the first half of July, 1,667 basic flood control team leaders, deputy captains of township flood control teams, and others have been trained. After the flood control team in Xinxiang Special District, Henan Province was reviewed, flood control technical studies were also launched.

Various places in the lower reaches of the Yellow River have generally prepared flood control tools and materials, and preparations for defending against extraordinarily large floods are also being carried out very closely. In Henan Province, central township flood control headquarters have been established in areas planned for flood detention, and cadres have been sent to various villages to inspect flood control dikes, mobilizing residents to draw up plans for safe evacuation in the event of flood detention. The materials prepared by Shandong Province for flood diversion have been transported to the construction site, and organizations responsible for the evacuation of residents in the flood detention area when necessary have also been established one after another.

    黄河下游加强防汛队伍
    新华社郑州26日电　黄河下游从专区到乡各级防汛指挥部已经先后成立，强大的防汛队伍已经组织起来。
    为了提高防汛队伍的战斗力，山东省沿黄河地区已经组成的防汛基干队都经过了整顿。其中一些病、残、老、弱的人都被掉换，并且充实了共产党员、青年团员骨干和防汛有经验的人。目前，沿黄河各县正在举办防汛干部短期训练班。据齐东、济南等七个县、市的统计，到七月上半月为止，已经训练了防汛基干班班长、乡防汛队副队长等1，667名。河南省新乡专区的防汛队伍经过检阅后，防汛技术学习也开展起来了。
    黄河下游各地对防汛工具和料物已经大致准备齐全，对防御特大洪水的准备工作也抓的很紧。河南省在计划滞洪的地区建立了中心乡防洪指挥部，派干部到各村检查防洪的围堰，发动居民订立一旦进行滞洪时安全迁移的计划。山东省为分洪准备的器材已经运往工地，负责滞洪区内居民在必要时迁移的机构也先后建立起来了。
