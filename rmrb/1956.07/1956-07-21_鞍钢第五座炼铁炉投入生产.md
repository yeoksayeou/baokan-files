Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, 20th - Anshan Iron and Steel's fifth automated blast furnace - No. 9 blast furnace - produced its first molten iron at 1 PM today.

This blast furnace, designed according to the Soviet new technology of high-pressure furnace top operation, is currently the largest blast furnace in China. Construction began in January of this year, and after more than six months of labor by the builders, it has now been put into production.

Xu Julang, the furnace chief of this blast furnace, told Xinhua reporters: The new technology of high-pressure furnace top operation can increase output by about 5%-7%. It can also save approximately 30 kilograms of coke for each furnace of iron produced. The appearance of this blast furnace is also particularly magnificent, as it is welded together from large steel plates using electric welding methods. Every weld is very tight, and no gas pressure, no matter how high, can leak through the welds.

    鞍钢第五座炼铁炉投入生产
    据新华社鞍山20日电　鞍钢建设的第五座自动化炼铁炉——九号高炉，在今天下午一时生产出第一炉铁水。
    根据苏联新技术——高压炉顶操作要求设计的这座炼铁炉，是中国目前最大的一座炼铁炉，它是从今年一月开始建设的。经过建设者们六个多月的劳动，现在已经投入生产。
    这座高炉的炉长徐矩良告诉新华社记者：采用高压炉顶操作的新技术，可以提高产量5％—7％左右。每炼一炉铁还可以节省大约三十公斤焦炭。这座高炉的外貌也特别壮丽，它是用电焊方法把大块钢板焊接起来的。它的每一条焊缝都非常严密，瓦斯压力再高也不能透过焊缝泄露出来。
