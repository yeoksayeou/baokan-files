Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 15th. According to the United States Information Service, Admiral Radford, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said in a statement on the 13th that the United States has military obligations regarding the security of the "Free World," and the United States will not unilaterally change this obligation. However, Radford emphasized the possibility: "Due to the manufacture of new weapons, the manpower required for the future security of the United States can eventually be reduced."

Before Radford's statement, news reports said he had suggested reducing the US armed forces by 800,000 by 1960.

This news has aroused fierce opposition from the heads of the US Army, Navy, and Air Force, as well as some members of Congress.

    雷德福说
    美武装部队数目可能削减
    新华社15日讯　据美国新闻处华盛顿消息：参谋长联席会议主席雷德福海军上将在十三日发表的一项声明中说，美国在“自由世界”的安全方面负有军事上的义务，美国将不片面地改变这种义务。但是，雷德福强调这种可能性：“由于新武器的制造，美国将来的安全所需要的人力最后可以减少。”
    在雷德福发表声明之前，报纸刊载的消息说他曾经建议到1960年削减美国的武装部队八十万人。
    这个消息已经引起美国陆、海、空军负责人以及某些议员的剧烈反对。
