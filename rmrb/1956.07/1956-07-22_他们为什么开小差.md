Why They Ran Away
By our reporter Gu Ye

A large number of new workers ran away from the work area responsible for constructing the Shijiazhuang-Yangquan double-track railway. The reason was that the work area under the First Engineering Section of the Fourth Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Railways arranged a set of unbearable living conditions for the workers:

Clothing – Although not completely naked, they could not change their clothing according to the season. The wages the workers received were barely enough to eat. When they first came from the countryside, they wore cotton clothes, and later when it got hot, they still wore cotton clothes. When their shoes were broken, they didn't have money to buy new ones.

Food – Although they weren't always starving, the amount of food was small, the price was high, and the quality was low. Generally, new workers spent an average of more than eighteen yuan per month on food, and some people's wages were not enough to eat.

Housing – Mostly dark and damp shacks. These shacks "were afraid of both sunny and rainy days": when it was sunny, the stench evaporated, making it unpleasant; when it rained, many places in the shacks leaked. Environmental sanitation was even worse, with flies everywhere and bedbugs crawling around.

The workers couldn't bear this kind of life, so they went to the leadership to solve it. The answer they received was simple and strange: "The difficulties were brought on by yourselves. Piece-rate wages are implemented, more work, more pay, you don't work hard, you deserve to suffer!" This was a great injustice! New workers from the countryside, who doesn't want to work hard? Who wants to earn wages that are not enough to eat and wear? The problem is that although this engineering section implemented the piece-rate wage system for 90% of the workers, no one organized the new workers to improve their skills and reach the quota. What was particularly serious was that three different quotas were announced to the workers for the work of plastering the roof. The first announcement: completing eight cubic meters a day was considered meeting the quota. After the workers met this requirement, the second time they announced: ten cubic meters was considered meeting the quota. A few days later, they announced again: it was necessary to reach twelve cubic meters to be considered "truly" completing the quota! When settling wages, twelve cubic meters was indeed used as the standard. The workers couldn't keep up with this rapidly developing quota even if they tried their best. In the end, most of the new workers received very low wages. The workers asked to borrow some money to buy shirts and shoes, but the leadership did not agree. So, the workers had to ask to go home. The answer they received was even stranger: "Want to go home? No one is tying your legs, but we won't transfer your grain supply certificate here. See you go!" This is the "traveling" (行) experience of these workers in terms of clothing, food, housing, and transportation.

In this workplace lacking material guarantees, in this place where no one cares, many workers couldn't bear it anymore. As a result, these new workers who had just been mobilized from the countryside to support industrial construction, as of May, 684 people had run away without even asking for their grain supply certificates.

The leaders of this engineering section thought: "It's no big deal if they leave, the labor department will replenish us." So, on June 30, the First Engineering Section of the Fourth Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Railways sent people to the Shanxi Provincial Labor Bureau to request an additional 1,700 laborers. The Labor Bureau was at this time asking them to properly handle the problem of the workers who had run back home, so they replied: "If this problem is handled well, we can replenish labor." Just as they were readily agreeing, the Labor Bureau received a long-distance call from the Yuci Prefecture Labor Section: "Another 150 workers from Meng County have run away from the First Engineering Section. Their representatives are at the prefecture asking the construction site to return the grain supply certificates that were withheld." The comrades of the Labor Bureau had to say to the staff of the First Engineering Section: "You can't ask for people on the one hand and drive people away on the other. If the problem of these 150 people is not resolved well, we will not give you those 1,700 workers. Because giving it to you is equivalent to giving it away for nothing, they will still run away."

In contrast to the situation of the First Engineering Section of the Fourth Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Railways, the Second Work Section of the Fourth Engineering Office of the Taiyuan Engineering Bureau cared about the new workers from the beginning. After the Party branch of the work section discovered that the new workers were not meeting the quota, they analyzed the reasons and made corresponding resolutions. Then, a short-term training class was held on the construction site to train the leaders and deputy leaders of the new workers' groups, eliminating the phenomenon of wasted work caused by the group leaders not knowing how to arrange work.

The Communist Party members and old workers on the construction site, under the leadership and education of the Party branch, actively helped the new workers. Foreman Guo Liquan is a Communist Party member. Among the eight groups he led, there were more than 120 new workers. At the beginning, these workers often failed to meet the quota. He thought: If this continues, the lives of these people will be affected, and the national plan will not be completed. So he went to the groups to help specifically. One day, he found that the Gao Haizhu group was digging and transporting earth, with two people carrying and two people shoveling. When the people carrying the earth left, the people shoveling were idle. He helped them find ways to make full use of working hours so that both the carriers and the shovelers could work continuously. As a result, this group improved from not meeting the quota to exceeding the quota by 10%. In April, seven of the eight groups led by Guo Liquan completed or overfulfilled their tasks, and the new workers increased their income.

In terms of living, this work section also cared about the new workers. When the new workers first arrived at the construction site, they generally wore cotton jackets. Later, when the weather got hot, some people couldn't change their cotton jackets because of economic difficulties. The trade union immediately signed a contract with the sewing cooperative, adopting a method of installment deductions, so that 122 new workers wore single-layer clothes, which were more than one yuan cheaper per set than buying them retail. Zhang Hucheng and others said gratefully: "The Party cares about us so thoughtfully! We are on the construction site, just like being at home. Wouldn't we be letting everyone down if we didn't work harder in production?"

Originally, because of the increase in new workers, eighteen groups in this construction site failed to meet the quota in March. By April, due to the development of work in various aspects, the vast majority of the new workers, accounting for more than 51% of the total number of workers in the entire section, broke through the quota.

The situation of these two construction sites tells us: Caring about the suffering of the masses is an important guarantee for completing tasks. Completely ignoring this point will inevitably lead to setbacks like the First Engineering Section of the Fourth Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Railways!

    他们为什么开小差
    本报记者　顾页
    大批新工人从承担修建石家庄——阳泉复线工程任务的工区里逃跑了。原因是铁道部第四工程局第一工程段所属工区给工人们安排了一套令人难以忍受的生活：
    衣——虽不是衣不蔽体，却是衣不分季。工人们拿到的工资只勉强够吃，刚从农村来的时候穿的是一身棉衣，后来天热了，还是棉衣一身。鞋破了，也没有钱去买新的。
    食——虽不是经常饿肚子，但是吃的东西数量少，价格高，质量低。一般新工人，每人每月平均支出的伙食费在十八元以上，有的人工资收入就不够吃饭。
    住——大多是又黑又潮的工棚。这些工棚“又怕晴，又怕雨”：天晴的时候臭气蒸发，令人难闻；雨天，工棚里好些地方又漏水。环境卫生更加恶劣，苍蝇到处飞，臭虫到处爬。
    这种生活，工人们受不了，就去找领导上解决。得到的答复干脆而奇怪：“困难是你们自己找来的。实行计件工资制了，多劳多得，你们不好好干活，活该受罪！”这才是天大的冤枉！从农村来的新工人，谁不愿意好好干活？谁愿意挣的工资不够吃穿？问题是，这个工段虽然在90％的工人中实行了计件工资制，但是没有人组织新工人去提高技术，达到定额。特别严重的是，在抹房顶这项工作上竟向工人宣布了三次不同的定额。第一次宣布：一天完成八方就算达到定额。工人们达到这个要求以后，第二次又宣布：十方才算达到定额。不几天又宣布：必须达到十二方才是“真正的”完成了定额！在结算工资的时候，也真的以十二方为准。这个飞速发展的定额，工人们真是拚命也赶不上。最后，大多数新工人得到的工资都非常低。工人们要求暂借一些钱买衬衣和鞋子，领导上也不答应。于是，工人们只好要求回家。得到的答复就更加奇怪了：“要回家吗？谁也没有拴住你们的腿，只是这里不给转粮食供应证。看你们走！”这也就是这些工人们衣食住行中“行”的遭遇。
    在这个缺乏物质保证的工作场所，在这个没有人关切的地方，许多工人实在忍受不下去了。于是，这些刚从农村动员来支援工业建设的新工人，到五月份就有六百八十四人连粮食供应证也没有要就开小差走了。
    这个工段的领导人员却认为：“走了也没有什么了不起，劳动部门会给我们补充。”于是，在六月三十日，铁道部第四工程局第一工程段就派人到山西省劳动局要求再补充一千七百名壮工。劳动局这时候正叫他们妥善地处理跑回家去的工人的问题，因而回答他们说：“这个问题处理好了，可以再补充劳力。”正当他们满口应承的时候，劳动局接到榆次专署劳动科打来的长途电话：“又有盂县的一百五十名工人从第一工程段跑了。他们的代表正在专署要求工地把扣下的粮食供应证发还。”劳动局的同志只得对第一工程段的工作人员说：“你们不能再这样一边要人，一边又把人撵走。这一百五十个人的问题不很好地解决，那一千七百名工人我们就不给。因为给你们等于白给，他们还会跑光的。”
    同铁道部第四工程局第一工程段的情形相反，太原工程局第四工程处第二工段从一开始就很关心新工人。工段党支部发现新工人达不到定额以后，分析了原因，作了相应的决议。接着，工地上举办了一个短期训练班，训练新工人中的正副小组长，消除了因为小组长不会安排工作而产生的窝工现象。
    工地上的共产党员和老工人，在党支部的领导和教育下，都积极帮助新工人。工长郭李全是个共产党员。他领导的八个小组中，有一百二十多名新工人，开始的时候这些工人都经常达不到定额。他想：这样下去，这些人的生活受影响，国家计划也没法完成。他就到各组具体帮助。一天，他发现高海柱小组挖运土方是两人抬、两人铲，抬土的人走了，铲土的人闲着，他就帮助他们设法充分利用工时，使抬的铲的都能不间断地工作，结果这个小组由达不到定额提高到超过定额10％。四月份，郭李全领导的八个小组，有七个都完成或超额完成了任务，新工人都增加了收入。
    在生活方面，这个工段对新工人也很关心。新工人刚到工地的时候一般都穿棉袄。后来天气热了，有的人因为经济困难，棉袄换不下来。工会便立即和缝纫合作社签订合同，采用分期扣款的办法，使一百二十二名新工人穿上了单衣，这些单衣每套比零买便宜一元多。张虎成等人感激地说：“党关心我们真周到啊！我们在工地上，跟在自己家里一样。生产上不加把劲还说得过去吗？”
    这个工地原来因为新工人增加，在三月份有十八个小组达不到定额。到四月份，由于各方面工作的开展，占全段工人总数51％以上的新工人，绝大多数都突破了定额。
    这两个工地的情况告诉我们：关心群众的痛痒是完成任务的重要保证，完全忽视了这一点，就难免会像铁道部第四工程局第一工程段那样碰壁！
