The Inevitable Trend of the Development of China's People's Democratic System
    ——Understanding the Policy of "Long-Term Coexistence and Mutual Supervision" between the Communist Party of China and the Democratic Parties
    Shao Lizhi
    At the Third Session of the First National People's Congress, Vice-Chairman Li Weihan, in his speech on the work of the United Front, clearly stated:
  “The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China has proposed the policy of long-term coexistence and mutual supervision between the Communist Party and the democratic parties, with the primary role of supervision being exercised over the Communist Party.” As a member of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang (RCCK), one of the democratic parties, I felt incredibly uplifted upon hearing this statement; however, this was not a sudden surge of excitement due to being "pleasantly surprised," but rather a further upliftment of "having experienced" it before.
    The democratic parties are an important component of the Chinese People's Democratic United Front. The United Front is one of the three major magic weapons of the Chinese revolution. As early as the May Fourth Movement, Chairman Mao, in the "Xiangjiang Review" he founded, focused on promoting the idea of "the great union of the masses," which can be said to be the earliest idea proposed by Chinese communists for establishing a united front. In June 1923, the Third National Congress of the Communist Party of China passed a resolution to unite with the Kuomintang to establish a revolutionary united front. Mr. Sun Yat-sen agreed and accepted this proposal, realizing the first Kuomintang-Communist cooperation. In 1935, the Communist Party of China issued the "August 1st Declaration" to "organize the anti-Japanese National United Front." After the "July 7th Incident" in 1937, Chiang Kai-shek, compelled by the situation, accepted this policy, realizing the second Kuomintang-Communist cooperation. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, many democratic parties emerged; and within the Kuomintang, there were also democrats who supported Sun Yat-sen's Three Great Policies and opposed the diehards. In 1948, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China issued the "May 1st Slogan," calling for the convening of a new Political Consultative Conference, which was responded to by all the democratic parties. In 1949, all the democratic parties participated in the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, participated in the people's democratic regime, and established their political and legal status. The General Program of the Constitution of the People's Republic of China announced in September 1954 further clarified that the United Front would continue to play its role. In December of the same year, the Second National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference was formed and convened its first plenary session, formulating a charter and deciding on the principles to be jointly observed. From the above brief historical narrative, it is sufficient to show that the Chinese People's Democratic United Front and the organization of the democratic parties conform to the objective requirements of the Chinese revolution and have broad prospects for development.
    However, in recent years, there have been two opinions regarding the future of the democratic parties: one is whether democratic parties are still needed after the completion of socialism; the other is that by that time, the democratic parties will have completed their historical mission. Although the starting points of these two opinions are different, neither of them has paid attention to the lasting role of the democratic parties and the United Front. The policy of the Communist Party of China has always been to constantly consolidate and expand the United Front. Moreover, the classic works of Marx on the dictatorship of the proletariat do not mention that only one political party is allowed to exist. The reason why there is only one party in the Soviet Union is because other parties at that time opposed socialism; the specific situation in China is different, and democratic parties support socialism, so multiple parties are allowed to coexist. I think this is precisely the characteristic of our country. The democratic parties arose with the people's democratic revolution and developed with the socialist revolution. Whether viewed from its history or theory, its role is not temporary but lasting. Because on the one hand, it has a broad social foundation and represents the demands of a considerable number of people; on the other hand, it can "unite all forces that can be united" and "transform negative factors into positive factors"; during the period of peaceful transition, it assists the state in carrying out class transformation through persuasion and education, and even after the elimination of classes, it will continue to carry out the task of eliminating the ideological remnants of classes for a long time. These changes and developments are quite lasting. As for when a communist society is fully built, if political parties are no longer needed, that is a problem that includes the Communist Party itself, as Chairman Mao made very clear in his article "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship."
    Since the Communist Party of China and the democratic parties are to "coexist for a long time," that means they must "supervise each other." The meaning of supervision is to use criticism and self-criticism, based on correct theory and reflection of the actual situation, to mutually correct each other's biased thoughts and actions. Since the establishment of the democratic parties, the Communist Party of China has treated us in this way. Personally, I feel that the Communist Party has provided great help to our democratic parties on issues of principle; however, due to historical reasons, some issues still inevitably involve some "politeness" and "reservation," in other words, the supervision is still somewhat insufficient. On the other hand, one of the founding principles of the Communist Party of China is to follow the mass line, which means that it must centralize the opinions of the masses and accept the supervision of the masses. This is the case for the general public, and it is even more so for the democratic parties that make up the United Front. Because opinions put forward after being concentrated and considered by an organization are more correct and mature than those of ordinary individuals. The democratic parties are comrades-in-arms of the Communist Party of China, and they must also be critical friends. In recent years, every democratic party has fulfilled some of the responsibilities of a critical friend to the Communist Party of China. As Chairman Mao said, "State affairs are the public affairs of the country, not the private affairs of one party or faction." The Communist Party of China consults, listens to, and adopts the opinions of the democratic parties on major national issues related to policies, guidelines, and routes; the democratic parties can also "speak without reservation and say everything they know," and sometimes even after fierce debates, a unified conclusion is finally reached. Personally, whether it was in the past few years at the CPPCC meetings, in the State Council, or in the past three years, at the NPC plenary sessions, in the NPC Standing Committee, and whether it was at large or small meetings or personal talks outside the meetings, I spoke about what I saw, thought, and believed should be said, and quite a few of my opinions were adopted. Of course, some of my opinions were based on my insufficient understanding of the situation, and I revised them myself after explanations. In addition, some opinions were not adopted at the time, but were still implemented when the time was right. It goes without saying that other democratic parties have offered more opinions and made greater contributions, so one of the achievements of the democratic parties is that in the development of criticism and self-criticism, on the one hand, they accept the supervision of the Communist Party and constantly improve themselves, and on the other hand, they play a supervisory role over the Communist Party. Of course, the supervisory role played in the past was very insufficient. One reason is that the socialist ideological level of the democratic parties is not high enough to put forward positive opinions, and the other reason is that there is also considerable "politeness" and "reservation," which should be improved and corrected in the future. We must realize that there can be development only with contradictions, and that launching criticism and debate can promote social progress; we must have more discussions and more publicity to implement the meaning of mutual supervision among the masses, and put forward critical opinions in a realistic and as objective manner as possible; only in this way can we embody the principle of collective leadership, prevent the tendency of personality cult, and further develop the enthusiasm of the democratic parties.
    Perhaps some people will raise this question: "Isn't it self-contradictory for the democratic parties to supervise the Communist Party while accepting the leadership of the Communist Party?" This is because they do not understand the nature of the democratic parties in China today and have mistakenly used the perspective of treating political parties in capitalist countries. The democratic parties in China arose and developed during the Chinese People's Democratic Revolution and the National Revolution. The Chinese People's Revolution, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, achieved a great victory, and it is very natural for the democratic parties to accept the leadership of the CPC. Over the past six or seven years, with the changes in domestic class relations, the democratic parties have accepted socialism and adopted a political line of serving socialism. On the principles of socialist construction and socialist transformation, they must accept the unified leadership of the Communist Party, otherwise they will not become a united front. Even so, the democratic parties and the Communist Party are still legally equal, and the freedom granted to citizens by Article 87 of the Constitution is realized through the democratic parties and mass organizations. Therefore, Vice-Chairman Li Weihan emphasized in his speech that "it is necessary to strictly respect the political freedom and organizational independence of the democratic parties and people's organizations within the scope of the rights and obligations conferred by the Constitution." This is the legal basis for the democratic parties to supervise the Communist Party; this is consistent with the democratic parties accepting the leadership of the Communist Party. We do not have the superficial freedom of political parties in capitalist countries, we want to play the role of "mutual supervision" under the principle of socialism.
    Therefore, I realize that the proposal of the policy of "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision" between the Communist Party of China and the democratic parties is not accidental, but the inevitable trend of the Chinese People's Democratic United Front; that is to say, it is not due to the subjective ideas of the Communist Party of China, but due to the existence of objective facts, reflecting the needs of the masses of people in China's specific circumstances, and also reflecting the needs of socialist construction and socialist transformation, becoming a certain force to promote social progress. As for why this policy is only being clearly put forward now, it is because today our socialist cause has achieved great and many achievements, and the People's Democratic United Front is becoming more and more consolidated and expanded; clearly putting it forward on such a social foundation has even greater significance in line with realistic expected development. Under this policy, I am willing to do my best to contact former Kuomintang members and upper and middle-class people in society who have historical relations with the former Kuomintang, unite around the government, and further play the due role of the United Front.

    中国人民民主制度发展的必然趋势
    ——对中国共产党和各民主党派“长期共存、互相监督”方针的体会
    邵力子
    在第一届全国人民代表大会第三次会议上，李维汉副委员长关于统一战线工作的发言中，明确地说：
  “中共中央已经提出了共产党和各民主党派长期共同存在，互相监督，首先是对共产党起监督作用的方针。”作为民主党派之一的民革的成员听了这句话，当然感到无比的振奋；可是这不是“喜出望外”的突然振奋，而是“曾经体验”的进一步的振奋。
    民主党派是中国人民民主统一战线中的一个重要组成部分。统一战线是中国革命的三大法宝之一。远在五四运动初期，毛主席在所创办的“湘江评论”上着重宣传了“民众大联合”的思想，可以说是中国共产主义者最早提出的必须建立统一战线的思想。到了1923年6月，中国共产党第三次代表大会通过团结国民党建立革命统一战线的决议，孙中山先生赞同并且接受这个建议，实现了第一次的国共合作。1935年中国共产党发出“组织抗日民族统一战线”的“八一”宣言，1937年“七七”事变后，蒋介石迫于时势，接受这个政策，实现了第二次的国共合作。在抗日战争时期，产生了不少的民主党派；而国民党内部也有了拥护孙中山三大政策的民主派同顽固派相对抗。1948年中共中央发布“五一口号”，号召召开新的政治协商会议，获得各民主党派的响应。1949年各民主党派参加了中国人民政治协商会议，参加了人民民主政权，确定了在政治和法律上的地位。1954年9月宣布的中华人民共和国宪法总纲内更明确规定统一战线将继续发挥它的作用。同年12月人民政协第二届全国委员会组成，召开第一次全体会议，制定了章程并且决定共同遵守的准则。从以上简略史实的叙述，足可表明中国人民民主统一战线和各民主党派的组织符合着中国革命客观的要求，有它广泛发展的前途。
    但是这几年来，对于民主党派前途的估计，不免发生两种意见：一种是怀疑到了社会主义建成还要不要民主党派；另一种认为到了那时，民主党派就完成了它的历史使命。这两种意见的出发点虽然不同，却都未注意民主党派和统一战线的持久性的作用。中国共产党的政策，从来都是主张不断地巩固和扩大统一战线。而且马克思关于无产阶级专政的经典著作中，并没有说到只许一个政党存在，苏联之所以只有一个党是由于当时的其他党派都反对社会主义；中国的具体情况不同，民主党派拥护社会主义，就容许多党共存。我想这正是我们国家的特点，民主党派随着人民民主革命而产生，随着社会主义革命而发展，无论从它的历史上和理论上来看，它的作用都不是暂时的而是持久的。因为一方面它具有社会广泛的基础，代表相当群众的要求；另方面它能“团结一切可能团结的力量”、“变消极因素为积极因素”；在和平过渡时期，以说服教育方法，协助国家进行阶级改造，在阶级消灭以后，还要长期进行对于阶级遗留思想的肃清。这些情况的变化和发展是要相当持久的。至于到了共产主义社会完全建成，如果党派不需要存在，那是连共产党都包括在内的问题，毛主席早在“论人民民主专政”文中讲得很明白了。
    中国共产党和各民主党派既是“长期共存”，那就意味着要“互相监督”。监督的意义是依据正确的理论和实际情况的反映，采用批评和自我批评的方法，来互相纠正对方的偏颇的思想和行动。自从有了民主党派以来，中国共产党对于我们就是这样作的。个人感到共产党关于原则性的问题是对我们民主党派尽到很大的帮助；但是由于历史的关系，有的问题还不免有所“客气”和“保留”，换句话说，就是监督得还有些不够。另一方面，中国共产党建党原则之一是走群众路线，它必须集中群众的意见，接受群众的监督。对一般群众是这样，对组成统一战线的民主党派更要这样。因为通过一个组织，加以集中考虑之后提出的意见，是比一般个人更为正确更为成熟的。民主党派是中国共产党的战友，同时也必须是诤友。这几年来，无论哪个民主党派都对中国共产党尽了一些诤友的责任。正如毛主席所说“国事是国家的公事，不是一党一派的私事”，共产党对于有关政策，方针，路线的国家大事，无不征询、倾听和采纳民主党派的意见；民主党派也能“知无不言、言无不尽”，有时还要经过激烈的辩争最后才得出统一的结论。以我个人来说，无论前几年在政协会议，在政务院，近三年，在人大全体会议，在人大常委会，也无论大会和小会以及会外个人接谈，所看到想到而认为应当讲的就讲，被采纳的意见不在少数。当然，有的意见是我了解情况不够就提出的，经过解释以后就自己修正。另外，有的意见当时虽然未被采纳，可是等待时机成熟，仍然见诸实行。其他民主党派人士所提意见之多，贡献之大，更不用多说了，所以民主党派成绩之一，就是在批评和自我批评的开展中，一方面接受共产党的监督自己不断地进步，另方面对于共产党起了监督的作用。当然，过去所起的监督作用是很不够的，一则是民主党派的社会主义思想水平不够，提不出积极的意见，再则也同样存有相当的“客气”和“保留”，这在今后应当加以提高和改正。我们必须认识到有矛盾才能有发展，发动批评和争辩才能推动社会前进；必须多加讨论，多加宣传，把互相监督的意义贯彻到群众中去，实事求是地，尽量客观地提出批评的意见；这样才能体现集体领导的原则，防止个人崇拜的倾向，进一步地发展民主党派的积极性。
    或许有人提出这样的疑问：“民主党派监督共产党，同接受共产党的领导不是自相矛盾吗？”这是他不了解今日中国民主党派的性质，而错用了对待资本主义国家政党的眼光。中国民主党派是在中国人民民主革命和民族革命时期产生和发展起来的。中国人民革命在中国共产党领导下获得了伟大的胜利，民主党派接受中共的领导是很自然的。六七年来随着国内阶级关系的变化，各民主党派已经接受社会主义，并且采取了为社会主义服务的政治路线。在社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业的原则上必须接受共产党的统一领导，否则就不成为统一战线了。虽然这样，民主党派同共产党还在法律上居于平等地位，宪法第八十七条所赋予公民的自由就是通过民主党派和民众团体而实现。所以李维汉副委员长在发言中强调指出“必须严格地尊重各民主党派和人民团体在宪法所赋予的权利义务范围内的政治自由和组织独立性”。这是民主党派可以监督共产党在法律上的根据；这和民主党派接受共产党的领导是一致的。我们不像资本主义国家政党那样表面上的自由，我们是要在社会主义原则下发挥“互相监督”的作用的。
    因此，我体会到中国共产党和各民主党派“长期共存、互相监督”的方针的提出不是偶然的，而是中国人民民主统一战线的必然趋势；也就是说不是由于中国共产党的主观想法，而是由于客观事实的存在，反映了中国具体情况下人民大众的需要，也反映了社会主义建设和社会主义改造的需要，成为推动社会前进的一定的力量。至于这个方针为什么现在才明确提出，那是因为今天我们社会主义事业已取得很大很多的成就，人民民主统一战线越来越巩固越来越扩大；在这样的社会基础上明确提出，就更具有符合现实预期发展的重大意义。我愿在这个方针下，尽力联系原国民党及与原国民党有历史关系的社会中上层人士，团结在政府的周围，进一步发挥统一战线应有的作用。
