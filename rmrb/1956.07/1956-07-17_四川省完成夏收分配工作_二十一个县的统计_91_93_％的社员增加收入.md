Chengdu, July 16th (This newspaper) – The summer harvest distribution work of over 200,000 agricultural production cooperatives in Sichuan Province has basically concluded. This year, the total income from spring crops in the province generally increased by more than 20% compared to last year. Due to the conscientious implementation of the spirit of "less deduction and more distribution" in various regions, the vast majority of commune members have increased their income. According to statistics from twenty-one counties, including Da County and Jiangjin, among the more than 640,000 commune member households, 91.93% of the households increased their income compared to last year, and the majority of the rest maintained last year's level.

In the early stages of the summer harvest pre-distribution work, leading staff in some areas did not pay enough attention to the pre-distribution of spring crops because they were busy with the production of major summer crops. Many agricultural cooperatives did not implement the spirit of "less deduction and more distribution," excessively retaining public accumulation and next year's production expenses, which affected the income of commune members. In Jiangjin Prefecture, among 2,140 cooperatives, after deducting public accumulation and production expenses for the second half of the year, 1,053 cooperatives distributed less than 60% of the income to commune members. 1,279 cooperatives could not guarantee that 90% of the commune members would increase their income. Some commune members complained, "The things in the agricultural cooperative are like flowers in a mirror, you can only look but not take. If we get little from the summer harvest, won't the autumn harvest be the same?"

After discovering this problem, the Sichuan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party issued instructions, pointing out that all regions should universally conduct inspections and make up for missed lessons in the summer harvest pre-distribution work. Many county party secretaries personally took action, leading the summer harvest distribution work and helping cooperatives revise unreasonable pre-distribution plans. During the make-up lessons, various regions also resolved the issue of reduced income for a small number of commune members in the pre-distribution of spring crops by adopting measures such as setting aside a certain amount of contingency funds for adjustment; reducing or exempting summer grain procurement tasks for cooperatives with smaller increases in production or reduced production; and requiring cooperatives with low grain income to retain public accumulation in cash rather than grain.

After adopting these measures, most commune members increased their income. In Mingshan County, before the make-up lessons, only about 60% of the 647 cooperatives could guarantee that 90% of the commune members would increase their income. After the make-up lessons, 97.8% of the cooperatives could guarantee that more than 90% of the commune members increased their income. Due to the reasonable summer harvest distribution, the enthusiasm of commune members for production was greatly improved, and the attendance rate generally increased. After the summer harvest pre-distribution in four agricultural cooperatives in Zhuyi Township, Fengjie County, commune members bought back more than ninety pigs with the pre-distributed cash.

    四川省完成夏收分配工作
    二十一个县的统计91.93％的社员增加收入
    本报成都16日电　四川省各地二十多万个农业生产合作社夏收分配工作已经基本结束。今年全省农业社小春作物总收入，一般比去年增产两成以上。各地由于认真贯彻“少扣多分”的精神，绝大多数社员都增加了收入。据达县、江津等二十一个县的统计，在六十四万多户社员中，有91，93％户社员比去年增加了收入，其余的大多数也保持了去年的水平。
    夏收预分工作初期，部分地区的领导工作人员，因忙于大春作物生产，对小春预分工作重视不够、不少农业社都没有执行“少扣多分”的精神，过多地扣留了公共积累和下年度生产费用，影响了社员的收入。江津专区二千一百四十个社在扣留公共积累和下半年生产费用以后，有1，053个社社员的分得部分不到收入的60％。有1，279个社不能保证90％的社员增加收入。有些社员不满地说：“农业社的东西是镜子中的花，只能看不能拿，夏收分得少，秋收还不是一样吗？”
    中共四川省委发现这一问题后，发出了指示，指出各地要普遍进行夏收预分工作的检查和补课。许多县委书记都亲自动手，领导夏收分配工作，帮助合作社修订了不合理的预分方案。各地在补课中，还解决了少数社员在小春预分中减少了收入的问题。采用提留一定机动数，进行调剂；对增产少或减产社减少夏征任务或免缴夏征；对粮食收入少的社，公共积累一律留现金不留粮食等措施。
    各地采取这些措施后，多数社员都增加了收入。名山县在补课前，647个社中只有60％左右的社能保证90％的社员增加收入，补课以后，有97.8％的社都能保证90％以上的社员增加收入了。由于夏收分配合理，大大提高了社员生产积极性，出工率普遍增加。奉节县朱衣乡四个农业社夏收预分后，社员把预分的现金买回了九十多口猪。
