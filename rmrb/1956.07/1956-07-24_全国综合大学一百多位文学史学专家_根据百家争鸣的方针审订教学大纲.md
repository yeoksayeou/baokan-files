Xinhua News Agency, July 23rd. At the recent conference convened by the Ministry of Higher Education to revise the teaching syllabi for arts and history departments in higher education institutions, more than 160 experts in literature and history from national comprehensive universities conducted extensive discussions based on the policy of "Letting a Hundred Flowers Bloom, Letting a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend."

    After the policy of "Letting a Hundred Flowers Bloom, Letting a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend" was put forward, some professors believed that the teaching syllabi were too restrictive to teachers, limiting their ability to express their own opinions. Therefore, they should be abolished. Some professors believed that there could be teaching syllabi, but they should only be used as references. At this conference, the first question that experts encountered was whether higher education institutions needed teaching syllabi at all? Is there a contradiction between teaching syllabi and "Letting a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend"? After discussion, it was unanimously agreed that teaching syllabi were essential and an important guiding document in teaching. Experts believe that in recent years, the general level of students in higher education institutions has generally improved. One of the reasons is that schools have adopted unified teaching plans and teaching syllabi, enabling students to receive more complete and systematic scientific knowledge. However, the disadvantage in the past was that the teaching syllabi were "legalized," which affected "Letting a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend." Regarding the interpretation of some academic issues, only one opinion was discussed, and other opinions were not introduced, so the students' horizons were not broadened, and they could not fully develop their ability to think independently. After discussion, the experts reached a consensus that when there are major differences of opinion in certain courses, in addition to the teaching syllabi revised this time, a second or third teaching syllabus is allowed; as long as the school has a systematic explanation after discussion by the teaching and research group, and after filing with the Ministry of Higher Education, it does not have to adopt the previous teaching syllabus. When teachers are teaching in the classroom, in addition to teaching faithfully according to the syllabus, they are also allowed to talk about their own views. If individual teachers still have different opinions, they can also be allowed to give lectures in senior grades, so that graduate students and senior students can study their theories. Experts believe that this not only guarantees a certain quality for students and does not limit "Letting a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend," but also prevents the shortcomings of teaching only the views of a certain school and obliterating the achievements of other schools in teaching.

    The discussion of the Chinese history teaching syllabus first touched on the issue that historians are still debating to this day—the periodization of ancient history. Since liberation, in the teaching of ancient history in higher education institutions, the theory of feudalism in the Western Zhou Dynasty has generally been adopted regarding the periodization issue. Among the historians who participated in this conference, some advocated the theory of feudalism in the Western Zhou Dynasty, some advocated the theory of feudalism in the Wei and Jin Dynasties, some advocated the theory that the Warring States period was the transition from slavery to feudalism, and some scholars had other views. Their academic views did not reach a consensus, but they all agreed to adopt the theory that the Warring States period was the transition from slavery to feudalism in the teaching syllabus. They believe that even if the periodization issue has not been resolved, the historical materials on which various theories are based are still similar. This syllabus includes the necessary historical facts and has a high scientific level. Experts agreed to adopt this syllabus, but in teaching and academic research, they can elaborate or retain their own views. Some schools have different opinions, and different teaching syllabi are also allowed.

    Experts reached a relatively consistent opinion on the argument that the sprouts of capitalism in Chinese society originated in the middle of the Ming Dynasty. In the Chinese history teaching syllabus revised this time, the proportion of ethnic minority history has also been increased.

    When reviewing the teaching syllabus of "Modern Chinese History," the experts unanimously believed that the periods referred to as modern and contemporary Chinese history—from the Opium War of 1840 to the May Fourth Movement of 1919, and from the May Fourth Movement to the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949—should be collectively referred to as "General History of China—the Era of Semi-Colonial and Semi-Feudal Society." Because the social nature of these two parts belongs to a historical era, combining them is more conducive to teaching and scientific research. The period after 1949 is called "General History of China—the Era of the People's Republic of China." The periodization of modern Chinese history is also an issue that historians are studying, but historians agree with a periodization method adopted by this syllabus, believing that it is still relatively appropriate.

    Professors who teach Chinese literature and experts who study classical Chinese literature also engaged in heated debates when revising the teaching syllabus of "History of Chinese Literature." Regarding the writing of the "History of Chinese Literature," there are two views: writing by era and writing by genre. Finally, it was unanimously agreed to write by era, and it was pointed out that writing by genre makes it impossible to understand a writer's main achievements and other shortcomings. However, the history of literature is different from the history of economics, political history, and the history of philosophy. Therefore, when mastering this writing principle, experts believe that it is still necessary to be flexible. For example, if it is impossible to determine the era, it can also be written by genre. They believe that teaching "History of Chinese Literature" in higher education institutions is mainly to enable students to understand the development of classical Chinese literature and cultivate their ability to study classical literature. Therefore, teaching must focus on highlighting key points. On the issue of periodization of Chinese literature history, it has been initially determined to divide Chinese literature history into eight periods: literature from ancient times to the Spring and Autumn period, literature of the late Zhou Dynasty, literature of the Qin and Han Dynasties, literature of the Wei, Jin, Southern and Northern Dynasties, literature of the Sui, Tang and Five Dynasties, literature of the Song and Yuan Dynasties, literature of the Ming and Qing Dynasties, and literature from the Opium War to the May Fourth Movement.

    This conference also discussed the teaching syllabi of linguistics, Asian history, world history, and other courses. Experts also put forward some opinions on the teaching plan.

    The issue of compiling textbooks for each course has been initially resolved. The conference has initially determined the compilers and formed the editorial committee for each course.

    This syllabus revision conference was held in Beijing from July 5th to 15th, and sorting work was carried out after the meeting. It has now basically ended.

    全国综合大学一百多位文学史学专家
    根据百家争鸣的方针审订教学大纲
    新华社23日讯　在最近高等教育部召开的审订高等学校文、史科教学大纲会议上，全国综合大学的一百六十多位文、史学方面的专家，根据“百家争鸣”的方针展开了广泛的讨论。
    “百花齐放，百家争鸣”的方针提出后，曾经有教授认为教学大纲对教师的约束性太大，限制教师发挥自己的见解，因此应该取消教学大纲。有的教授认为可以有教学大纲，但只能作为参考。这次会上，专家们首先接触到的问题是高等学校的教学要不要教学大纲？教学大纲和“百家争鸣”有没有矛盾？经过讨论，一致认为教学大纲一定要，而且是教学中重要的指导性文件。专家们认为，近几年来，高等学校学生的一般水平有普遍提高。各校采用了统一的教学计划、教学大纲，使学生能够接受比较完整和系统的科学知识，这是原因之一。但是，过去的缺点是把教学大纲“法律化”了，因此影响了“百家争鸣”。对于一些学术问题的阐述，只谈一种意见，不介绍别的意见，使学生的眼界不开阔，不能充分发挥他们独立思考的能力。经过讨论，专家们得出的一致意见认为，某些课程有重大意见分歧时，除了这次审订的教学大纲外，还允许有第二、第三个教学大纲；学校只要经过教研组讨论，得出一个系统的说法来，向高等教育部备案后，就可以不采用前一种教学大纲。教师在课堂教学时，除了应该忠实地按照大纲教学外，还允许谈他自己的看法。如果个别教师还有不同的看法，还可以允许在高年级开讲座，让研究生和高年级学生来研究他的学说。专家们认为，这样，不仅可以保证学生一定的质量，没有限制“百家争鸣”，还可以防止在教学中只讲授某一学派的见解，抹杀其他学派的成就这些缺点。
    中国史的教学大纲的讨论，首先接触到的就是直到目前为止历史学家们还在争论着的问题——古代史的分期问题。解放以来，高等学校在古代史的教学上，关于分期问题一般采用的是西周封建论的说法。这次参加会议的历史学家中，有的是主张西周封建论的说法的，有的是主张魏晋封建论的说法的，有的是主张战国是奴隶制到封建制的过渡这一说法的，还有一些别的主张的学者，他们在学术上的见解并没有取得一致，但是都同意在教学大纲中采用战国是奴隶制到封建制的过渡这一说法。他们认为，分期问题即使没有解决，但是各种说法所根据的史料还是差不多的。这个大纲包括了必要的史实，有较高的科学水平。专家们同意采用这个大纲，但在讲授和学术研究中，他们可以阐述或保留自己的见解。有些学校有不同的意见，还可以允许有不同的教学大纲。
    专家们对于中国社会的资本主义萌芽产生在明代中叶的论点取得了比较一致的意见。在这次审订的中国史教学大纲中，还增加了少数民族历史的比重。
    “中国近代史”的专家们在审订教学大纲时，一致认为一向所说的中国近代史、现代史所指的时期——从1840年鸦片战争到1919年五四运动，从五四运动直到1949年中华人民共和国成立，应该总称为
  “中国通史——半殖民地半封建社会时代”。因为这两部分的社会性质属于一个历史时代，打通起来更有利于教学和科学研究。1949年以后称为“中国通史——中华人民共和国时代”。中国近代史的分期问题也是历史学家们正在研究中的问题，不过，历史学家们同意这次大纲所采用的一种分期法，认为还是比较妥当的。
    讲授中国文学的教授和研究中国古典文学的专家，在审订“中国文学史”的教学大纲时，也展开了热烈的论争。对于“中国文学史”的编写，存在着按年代编写和按体裁编写两种看法，最后一致同意按年代编写，并且指出按体裁编写使人不能了解一个作家的主要成就等一些缺点。不过，文学史不同于经济史、政治史、哲学史，所以在掌握这个编写原则时，专家们认为还需要有灵活性。如有的不能判断年代时，还可以按体裁编写。他们认为高等学校讲授“中国文学史”，主要是让学生了解中国古典文学发展的面貌，培养他们研究古典文学的能力，因此讲授时必须重点突出。对中国文学史的分期问题，初步确定把中国文学史分为八个时期：上古到春秋的文学、晚周文学、秦汉文学、魏晋南北朝文学、隋唐五代文学、宋元文学、明清文学和鸦片战争到五四运动时期的文学。
    这次会议，还讨论了语言学、亚洲史、世界史等课程的教学大纲。专家们对教学计划也提出了一些意见。
    各课程教材的编写问题已初步得到解决。会上已初步确定编写人，组成各门课程的编辑委员会。
    这次大纲审订会议是七月五日到十五日在北京召开的，会后又进行整理工作，现在已基本上结束。
