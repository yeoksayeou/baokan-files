One Key Opens One Lock
By Our Reporter Cao Baoming

	Hu Bingyuan, a scutcher at the Yuhua Cotton Mill in Wuhan, had been listless in his work for a long time, not seriously following operating procedures, and sometimes even taking leave. Everyone wanted to help him in study sessions, but he was always in a hurry to go home after work and didn't participate in extracurricular studies. The workshop leaders thought it was because his home was more than ten li from the factory, and he had to cross the river every day, making the commute too tiring. So they found a single room in the factory's dormitory for him, but he refused to move in. During this advanced producer campaign, the workshop staff visited his home and discovered the reason for his lack of motivation. It turned out that his family of five depended entirely on his income, and he only earned thirty-eight yuan a month, a small income with a heavy burden. He also owed thirty yuan, and with high interest rates, he had to pay three yuan in interest each month. Because of financial difficulties, he was thinking about his family while at the factory, but when he got home, his wife argued with him. Sometimes, on days when he was on night shift, he would ride a pedicab during the day to earn some money to supplement his income. Without proper rest and burdened with worries, he naturally lacked energy. After learning about this situation, the union helped him overcome his financial difficulties. First, they worked with the residents' committee to find the creditor and explained that lending at usurious rates was wrong and that high-interest payments should be stopped. It was agreed that Hu Bingyuan would give the money for repaying the debt to the union staff, who would pay off the debt for him. They also helped his family arrange their finances. After careful calculation, it was found that under normal circumstances, his family could save a few yuan each month to repay the debt. They also found out that one of the reasons he hadn't moved into the factory was that his family didn't have a spare quilt. Worker Chen Guangren voluntarily lent him money to buy a quilt. After moving into the factory dormitory, he was able to rest well and participate in extracurricular cultural studies three times a week. When he fell ill, the union also subsidized him ten yuan. Touched by this care and assistance, his work improved soon after and his technical skills also increased. At this point, the administration also promoted him from a third-grade worker to a fourth-grade worker according to the technical standards, and his monthly income also increased. Thus, he eliminated his financial worries and worked even harder.
	This is just one example of the scutching workshop helping workers overcome difficulties.
	During the advanced producer campaign, the scutching workshop's Party branch ranked the workers: among the 63 workers in the workshop, 15 were advanced producers, 35 were average, and 13 were lagging behind. Why were these people lagging behind? The workshop branch criticized the past practice of simply labeling these people as "backward" and demanded that all Party members and staff members divide the work to find out the real reasons for each person's backwardness. Combining this with the study of the major report and other educational methods, they adopted the approach of "one key opens one lock" and carried out individual mobilization. The branch also analyzed the characteristics of the scutching workshop, which had low technical levels, low wages, and mostly adult workers with large families and heavy burdens. It particularly emphasized the need to care for the workers' lives and help them overcome financial difficulties. In these months, 15 people received subsidies from the union because of special difficulties, not counting those with minor difficulties who were helped by loans from the workers' savings and mutual aid society.
	Through concrete and in-depth work, it was also discovered that not all problems in workers' families could be solved with money. A helper named Liu, with a family of four and a monthly salary of thirty-eight yuan, was initially thought to be performing poorly because of financial burdens. After individual inquiries, it was discovered that he suspected his wife of infidelity and rushed home to watch her after work, and spent his wages outside instead of bringing them home, causing financial hardship for the family. The union's women's committee investigated the situation around his home and found out that his wife was not unfaithful, but that he was simply suspicious. Therefore, the union educated him, saying that husbands and wives should trust and care for each other, and he himself promised to bring home thirteen yuan every half month. Thus, his ideological problem was solved, his family's financial problem was solved, and his work improved significantly.
	After a period of such meticulous work, the number of advanced workers in the workshop increased to twenty-six, the number of average workers was thirty-three, and only four people remained with relatively poor performance. Among these four people, one was old and frail, one was sick and weak, unable to keep up with production requirements, and two were young workers who felt that the scutching workshop was too simple and wanted to transfer to other departments to learn technical skills, unwilling to work there. Currently, the workshop is working with the factory leadership to study how to solve these remaining problems.

    一把钥匙开一把锁
    本报记者　曹葆铭
    武汉市裕华纱厂的清花工人胡炳元，长时期生产提不起精神，不认真执行操作法，有时候还请假不上工。大家想在学习会上帮助他，他一下班就急着回家去，也不参加业余学习。车间领导人以为他是因为家离工厂十多里路，还要过江，每天往返太累，便替他在工厂的单人宿舍里找到一个床位，但是他又不肯搬来住。在这次先进生产者运动中，车间的工作人员到他家去访问，才发现他工作不积极的原因。原来他五口之家，全靠他一人挣钱，而他一月工资只有三十八元，收入少，负担重。他还欠了三十元的债，利息大加一，每月光是利息就得支付三元。因为生活困难，他在厂里想着家里，但是一回家去，妻子又同他吵架。他有时就在轮着上夜班的日子里，白天去踏三轮车，挣点钱补贴生活。不能好好休息，思想负担又重，自然就没有精神。工会了解这个情况后，便帮助他克服生活中的困难。首先协同居民委员会把债主找来，说明放高利贷是不应该的，应该停止高利贷利息，并且商定以后胡炳元把还债的钱交工会工作人员，由工会替他还清债务。他们又帮助他家安排生活。经过仔细计算，他家在正常情况下，每月还可省下几元钱还债。他们还查出他过去不搬进工厂住的原因之一，是家里腾不出一条被子来，工人陈广仁自动借给他钱置了条被子。他搬进工厂宿舍以后，既能好好休息，还能参加一个星期三次的业余文化学习。他病了，工会又补助他十元。受到这些关怀和帮助，他非常感动，不久，工作就有了转变，技术水平也提高了。这时候行政上又按照技术标准把他由三级工升为四级工，每月的收入也增加起来。这样，他消除了生活上的顾虑，工作起来更加努力。
    这只是清花车间帮助工人克服困难的一个例子。
    在先进生产者运动中，清花车间党支部把工人排了一次队：全车间六十三人中，生产先进的十五人，一般的三十五人，落后的十三人。这些人为什么会落后呢？车间支部批判了过去对这些人简单地扣个“落后”帽子的错误作法，要求全体党员、工作人员分工摸清每个人所以落后的真实原因，结合大报告等教育方式，采取“一把钥匙开一把锁”的办法，进行个别发动。支部还分析了清花车间技术等级低、工资低，而工人又多是成年人，家口多、负担重的特点，特别强调要关怀工人的生活，帮助他们克服生活上的困难。在这几个月中，因为有特殊困难由工会补助的就有十五人，其余困难较小由工人储蓄互助会借钱解决的，还没有计算在内。
    经过具体深入的工作，也发现工人家庭里的问题并不是都需要花钱才能解决的。一个姓刘的辅助工，家有四口人，每月工资三十八元，大家起初也以为他是因为生活负担重工作才做得不好。经过个别了解后，才发现他是疑心妻子不正派，一下班就忙着回家去监视妻子，发了工资又不拿回家去，自己在外面胡花，造成家庭生活困难。工会妇女委员到他家周围去了解情况，弄清楚了他的妻子并不是不正派，只是他疑心大。于是，工会便教育他，说夫妻间应该互相信任、互相关怀，他自己也保证每半月送回家去十三元。这样，他的思想问题解决了，家庭生活问题也解决了，工作有了比较显著的改变。
    经过一个时期这样细致的工作，车间里生产先进的工人增加到二十六人，一般的三十三人，只剩下四个人工作比较差。这四个人中有一人是年老力衰，一人有病体弱，动作跟不上生产要求，两个人是青工，嫌清花车间技术简单，要求调别的部门学技术去，不安心生产。现在，车间正同工厂领导人员研究怎样解决这些剩下的问题。
