Xinhua News Agency, Friendship Farm, July 17th. The 16,000 hectares of spring wheat sown for the first time last year on the virgin land reclaimed by the state-owned Friendship Farm promises a bumper harvest. Early-maturing varieties have begun to turn from dark green to yellow. The wheat, over three feet tall, looks as neatly trimmed as if it had been manicured. The plump ears of wheat, now filling with grain, obscure the rows. On the afternoon of the 15th, Fang Cuinong, the farm's Deputy Chief Agricultural Technician, took a measurement in the fields and found about 500 ears of wheat per square meter, with most ears having ten to fifteen grains.

The wheat harvesting work will begin within the next ten days. From the main farm to the field operation stations of each production team, staff are preparing to welcome the bumper harvest. The installation and overhaul of combine harvesters is nearing completion, and the machines are undergoing final test runs. The construction of ten electrified threshing grounds is being rushed at night under the lights. Field roads are also being urgently repaired. On the 14th, the main farm held a meeting for combine harvester drivers. Soviet experts introduced the drivers to the work achievements and experiences of famous Soviet combine harvester drivers.

The meteorological forecast indicates that there may be continuous rainfall in the latter half of July and August. The farm is preparing to overcome weather unfavorable for harvesting. At the main farm and some branch farms, tents have been erected to house the farmers who are supporting the farm's wheat harvest. The manpower participating in the farm's emergency harvest, including the farm's staff and their families, will reach 5,000 people. The wheels of some combine harvesters have been modified to allow the machines to work on relatively damp land. Twenty-four swathers, manufactured by domestic factories, have been completed and are on their way to the farm. These swathers, which are lighter than combine harvesters, can be used for harvesting on low-lying, wet land.

    国营友谊农场迎接第一次丰收
    新华社友谊农场17日电　国营友谊农场在去年开垦的生荒地上第一次播种的一万六千公顷春小麦，丰收在望。早熟的品种开始由深绿转黄。三尺多高的小麦，一眼望去就像修剪过似的整齐，正在灌浆的肥大的麦穗，使人看不出垅行。十五日下午，农场的农业副总技师方悴农在田间做了一次测量，一平方公尺麦地的麦穗有五百个左右，多数的麦穗都有十个到十五个麦码。
    收割小麦的工作将在最近十天内开始。现在从总场一直到各生产队的田间作业站的职工们，正在准备迎接丰收。联合收割机的安装和检修工作已经接近完成，机器正在做最后的试运转。十个电气化晒麦场的修建工作，夜晚在灯光下赶修。田间道路也正在加紧修补。十四日，总场召开了联合收割机驾驶员会议。苏联专家向驾驶员们介绍了苏联著名联合收割机驾驶员们的工作成绩和经验。
    气象台的预告，七月下半月到八月，这里有可能连续降雨。农场准备战胜不利于收割的天气。在总场和一部分分场，已经搭起了一座座的帐篷，这是支援农场麦收的农民居住的地方。参加农场抢收的人力，包括农场的职工和家属，将要达到五千人。部分联合收割机的轮子进行了改装，使机器在比较潮湿的土地上能够工作。二十四台割晒机已经由国内承制的工厂制造好了，正在运来农场的途中。这种比联合收割机轻便的割晒机，可以在低湿地上进行收割。
