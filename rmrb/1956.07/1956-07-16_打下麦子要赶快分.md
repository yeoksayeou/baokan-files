    Threshing Wheat Requires Prompt Distribution
    The houses (the original ancient temple) around the office of the Xinshao First Agricultural Production Cooperative in Guizhou Province's Guizhu County are piled high with wheat that was harvested about a month ago. Many cooperative members are short of grain and urgently need wheat, but they haven't received a single grain. The stationed cadre and cooperative cadres both say: the work is too tight, we have to hoe tobacco, and also transplant rice seedlings and fight drought. How many buckets of water can one person carry? There's no time to distribute the wheat. As a result, the matter of distributing the wheat has been delayed until now and no one is addressing it.
    Every day, flocks of birds and groups of chickens come to the wheat piles for a "feast." The old monk in the temple raised seven hens. In the past, he didn't see a single egg for three days, but now he can collect seven eggs a day. The old monk, stroking his snow-white beard, said with a half-smile, "Everyone suffers less when entering the advanced cooperative, even my chickens and the nearby birds have turned over a new leaf." The cooperative members are very dissatisfied. They say, "We sweat like rain when planting wheat, but when the wheat is ripe, we can't eat it ourselves."

    打下麦子要赶快分
    贵州省贵筑县新哨第一农业生产合作社办公室周围的房子里（原来的古庙），堆满了割下来已经有一个月左右的麦子。许多社员缺粮急需麦子。但一粒麦子都没有分到手。驻社干部和社干部都说：活路太紧，要薅黄烟，又要插秧抗旱，一个人肩上能挑几挑水？没工夫分麦子。于是，分麦子的事拖到如今无人过问。
    每天，成群的鸟，结队的鸡都到麦子堆上来“会餐”。庙上老和尚喂了七只母鸡，过去三天不见一个蛋，现在一天能收七个蛋。老和尚手托着雪白的胡须似笑非笑的说道：“入高级社人人不受苦，就连我的鸡，附近的鸟也翻身了。”社员们都非常不满意，他们说：“种麦的时候汗如雨，麦子熟了，却吃不到自己的肚皮里。”
