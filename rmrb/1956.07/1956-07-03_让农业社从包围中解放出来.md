Let Agricultural Cooperatives be Liberated from Encirclement
Li Zhang

Many enterprise departments mistakenly treat agricultural production cooperatives as their grassroots units when promoting various business operations. As a result, cooperative cadres are busy with these tasks all day long, which also increases non-production labor and expenses for the cooperatives. Taking the Zhenli Cooperative in Chengguan Town, Qi County, Shanxi Province, as an example, according to a recent investigation by the county committee, this cooperative is being "encircled" by seven units:

    The department store wanted to sell some goods to cooperative members on credit. Each production team had to register names and create forms (with copies for the department store, supply and marketing cooperative, and agricultural cooperative), causing chaos. The categories of goods were complex, and some statisticians made mistakes in the numbers, causing them to rush back and forth anxiously. According to the cooperative's statistics, this work alone took 67 labor days and forty sheets of glossy paper.
    The coal construction company sold 1,400 tons of coal to cooperative members on credit, using 25 labor days to create the statistical tables. The procedures for buying coal were even more complicated. Each production team had to wait until there were five households, then issue a letter of introduction, and go to the cooperative for review and stamping before they could buy coal. This created three lines: queuing within the team to issue the letter, queuing within the cooperative to get the stamp, and queuing at the coal plant to buy the coal. According to preliminary statistics, from the establishment of the cooperative last winter to the present, issuing letters alone has used 352 labor days and cost 25 yuan in paper. The cooperative members said, "Selling coal on credit is good, but the wasted work time is unbearable."
    The Grain Bureau planned to place 280,000 jin of grain for the July to September supply directly into the cooperative, to be managed by the cooperative and supplied to the members in installments, which was estimated to require 180 labor days.
    The Postal and Telecommunications Bureau, in order to promote newspapers and magazines, forced the cooperative to subscribe to 127 newspapers and 126 magazines, costing a total of more than 230 yuan for three months. In reality, the cooperative did not need that many, and many newspapers and magazines became waste paper.
    The Food Company wanted to understand the cooperative's situation in raising pigs, sheep, chickens, etc., and created a form with a total of ninety-six items for the cooperative to fill out, with a deadline for completion.
    The Agriculture and Forestry Bureau, the Water Conservancy Section, and other units were no exception. They all assigned the cooperative many tasks that were not urgently needed.

This situation has caused unease among cooperative members, who asked, "What kind of department is our cooperative? It manages everything, with even more variety than a department store!" Accountant Duan Baotong said, "From silk to garlic, it's as if the cooperative has become a grocery store."

We should support the cooperatives, not surround them. No matter which unit it is, it should distinguish which things are currently needed by the masses and which are not. When promoting these tasks, we should also pay attention to working methods to make them beneficial to production and convenient for the masses, and not affect production or increase the burden on the masses.

To solve this problem, local Party committees at all levels also need to control the situation based on local conditions, making overall arrangements for things that need to be done and can be done; things that should not be done or cannot be done can be left undone, or reported to the higher-level Party committee, requesting the business departments that assigned the task to change their plans and retract their orders.

    让农业社从包围中解放出来
    黎璋
    有许多企业部门，错误的把农业生产合作社当成他们的基层单位去推行各项业务工作。结果使社干部成天为这些工作而忙乱，还增加了社里的非生产用工和开支。以山西省祁县城关镇真理社为例，据县委会最近的调查，这个社被七个单位所包围：
    百货公司要赊销给社员一部分商品，各个生产队于是登记花名、制造表格（百货公司、供销社、农业社各存一份）、闹的人仰马翻，商品名目繁杂，有的统计员把数字弄错了，急得来回转。据社里统计，仅这项工作就花了67个劳动日，四十张有光纸。
    煤建公司向社员赊销煤，订了1，400吨的合同，用25个工造好了统计表。至于买煤的手续，那就更复杂了。各个生产队必须等满五户，开上介绍信，到社里审查盖章，才能买煤。这样就形成了三排队：队内排队开条，社内排队盖章，煤厂排队买煤。据初步统计，从去冬建社到现在，仅开条就用去352个劳动日，纸张费25元。社员们说：“赊销煤倒是好，误工浪费吃不消”。
    粮食局准备把七月至九月的供应粮28万斤一下子放到合作社里，由社保管，分期供应社员，估计需用180个工。
    邮电局为了推销报刊，强制社里订了127份报纸，126份杂志，三个月共需230多元。实际上社里并不需要这样多，许多报刊都成为废品。
    食品公司要了解合作社喂养猪、羊、鸡等情况，制造了一种共有九十六个项目的表格叫合作社填，并要限期完成。
    农林局、水利科等单位也不例外，他们都给合作社布置了不少并不迫切需要的工作。
    这种情况引起社员的不安，他们问：“我们合作社算什么部门，样样事情都要管，比百货公司花样还多呢？”会计段宝通说：“上至绸缎，下至葱蒜，简直把社办成杂货铺了。”
    我们要支持合作社，而不要去包围合作社。不论是那一个单位，都应该分别哪些事情是为群众当前所需要的，哪些是不需要的。在推行这些工作的时候，又应该注意工作方法，使它有利生产，便利群众；而不能影响生产，增加群众负担。
    要解决这个问题，还需要各级地方党委根据当地情况加以控制，凡是需要办而又可能办的事情，应该统筹安排；凡是不应该办或不可能办的，就可以不办，或报告上级党委，要求布置该项任务的业务部门改变部署，收回成命。
