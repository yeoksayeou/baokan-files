Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, July 17th: The Gansu Provincial Agricultural Experiment Station has successfully tested a highly effective green manure crop - sweet clover. Experiments have proven that one mu of sweet clover green manure is equivalent to over 100 jin of oil cake and over 50 jin of chemical fertilizer (ammonium sulfate), exceeding the effectiveness of applying 5,000 jin of soil fertilizer (half human waste and half soil) per mu.

Sweet clover is an annual herbaceous plant of the legume family. It has great adaptability and grows very quickly, becoming usable as green manure in just over 40 days. Whether planted in summer or autumn fields, it can be plowed and pressed into the soil after it matures to become fertilizer the following year.

The Gansu Provincial Agricultural Experiment Station began conducting experiments on using this plant as green manure in 1952, and the experiments have now been completely successful. According to the experimental results, on land with the same fertility, spring wheat with sweet clover plowed under as green manure yielded 466.3 jin per mu, while spring wheat with field pea plowed under as green manure yielded 433.89 jin per mu, spring wheat with soybean plowed under as green manure yielded 319.22 jin per mu, and spring wheat with 5,000 jin of soil fertilizer applied per mu yielded 434 jin per mu.

Currently, the Gansu Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry is preparing to organize farmers in various regions to plant this crop on a large scale for green manure to solve the fertilizer shortage.

    香豆子
    一种肥效很高的绿肥
    新华社兰州17日电　甘肃省农业试验场试验成功一种肥效很高的绿肥作物——香豆子。试验证明，一亩香豆子的绿肥能顶一百多斤油饼和五十多斤化学肥料（硫酸铵）的肥效，超过每亩施用五千斤土粪（人粪和土各半）的肥效。
    香豆子是一种豆科一年生草本植物。它的适应性很大，发育很快，生长四十多天就可用来作绿肥。不论种在夏田或秋田，成长以后用犁翻压在地里，次年就可成为肥料。
    甘肃省农业试验场从1952年开始，就进行用这种植物压绿肥的试验，到现在试验全部成功。根据试验结果，在相同肥力的土地上，翻压这种植物作绿肥的春小麦，每亩产量为466.3斤，而翻压莞豆作物作绿肥的春小麦每亩产量为433.89斤，翻压黄豆作物作绿肥的春小麦每亩产量为319.22斤，每亩施用五千斤土粪的春小麦每亩产量为434斤。
    现在，甘肃省农林厅准备组织各地农民大量种植这种作物压绿肥，以解决肥料缺乏的困难。
