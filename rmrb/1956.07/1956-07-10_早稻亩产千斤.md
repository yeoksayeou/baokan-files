Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, 9th: Zhao'an County in Fujian Province has reported three mu of "1,000-jin fields" of early rice.

The Zhaoliang Agricultural Production Cooperative in Xinchun Township of this county has harvested three mu of high-yield early rice paddy fields, averaging over 1,046 jin of rice per mu, an increase of over 70% compared to the original yield. A working group dispatched by the Agriculture Bureau of the Zhao'an County People's Committee confirmed this high-yield record after on-site measurement and weighing.

These three mu of high-yield fields were cultivated by the Xu Suixing Production Team of the Zhaoliang Agricultural Cooperative. These three mu of land underwent an additional winter plowing compared to previous years, and 200 dan of Hong Kong mud per mu were applied to improve the soil. The superior Nan Te variety was selected, achieving dense planting and direct sowing, with timely transplanting. In order to prevent seedling rot and promote rapid seed germination and rooting, 30 to 40 jin of plant ash and burned soil were mixed with the seeds per mu. From the time the seedlings emerged from the water until harvest, in addition to strengthening field management, the cooperative members weeded twice before heading and applied 15 dan of stable manure, 40 jin of peanut cake, and 15 jin of fertilizer powder per mu.

    早稻亩产千斤
    新华社福州9日电　福建省诏安县出现三亩早稻“千斤田”。
    这个县的新春乡照亮农业生产合作社已收割的三亩双季稻早稻丰产田，平均每亩收稻谷一千零四十六斤多，比原有产量增加70％以上。诏安县人民委员会农业局派出的工作组，经过实地丈量和过秤，证实了这个高产纪录。
    这三亩高额丰产田是照亮农业社许随兴生产队耕种的。这三亩田比往年多冬耕一遍，每亩田里下了两百担港泥来改变土壤，又选用了南特号良种，作到密植直播，及时播秧。为了防止烂秧和促进种籽迅速生芽扎根，每亩还用三、四十斤草木灰和火烧土拌种。在幼苗出水后到收成期间，社员们除了注意加强田间管理外，还在抽穗前先后除了两遍草，在每亩田中下了十五担厩肥、四十斤花生饼、十五斤肥田粉。
