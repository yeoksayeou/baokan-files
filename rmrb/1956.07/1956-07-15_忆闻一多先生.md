    Remembering Mr. Wen Yiduo
    Kang Qian

    In the autumn of 1943, I transferred from Sichuan to the Southwest Associated University in Kunming, which had a rich revolutionary tradition, and studied under Mr. Wen Yiduo in the Chinese Department for three full years. From September 1943, starting with the first Tang poetry class, to May 1946, ending with the last Yuefu poetry class, I chose every course Mr. Wen offered, and attended every class; I grasped the spirit of Mr. Wen's speeches at various meetings, and followed Mr. Wen's actions in every movement; I often questioned Mr. Wen, and whether it was at his home in Gangtou Village, his home at Kunhua Middle School, or his home next to our South Campus girls' dormitory, I was always running in and out.

    In those three years, I saw how Mr. Wen moved from academia to politics, from the classroom to the square. But academia and politics were combined, and the classroom and the square also ran parallel in Mr. Wen's life. After meticulous and painstaking research, he attempted to use Marxist ideas to analyze Chinese literature and Chinese society. In his profound and detailed lectures, he enabled us to recognize how the lives of the people thousands of years ago were reflected in brilliant literary works, and how the great writers were connected to the people by flesh and blood. When discussing the direction of political struggle, he always combined it with the current situation and pointed out the excellent traditions of the Chinese nation from history.

    Everyone knows that Mr. Wen as a patriotic poet and a passionate democrat was by no means something that started overnight; but he was able to rise up and join the revolutionary camp only after participating in the Democratic League and wholeheartedly accepting the leadership of the Communist Party.

    Mr. Wen engaged in the democratic movement within a certain organization and under the guidance of a certain ideology, and therefore he had strength and confidence. No matter how big or small the matter, as long as it was just and beneficial to the revolutionary cause, he would step forward regardless of everything.

    One spring evening after the "December 1st" Movement, the teachers and students of our Chinese Department invited a professor who had just returned from lecturing in the United States to talk about his impressions of traveling in America. This professor praised the United States to the skies, which we couldn't bear to listen to. The student who was chairing the meeting then asked, "We've heard that there are also slums in the United States. What kind of life do their working people live? We would also like to know." Unexpectedly, this professor immediately became angry and said, "I have no reason to answer your question, and I have other things to do now." With that, he stood up and walked out of the meeting. At this time, Mr. Wen stood up calmly and uttered his powerful voice. He said, "Our chairman's question is correct. That professor should correctly re-examine the inside story of the United States. He is an old friend of mine, and I will question him face to face after the meeting, hoping that he will improve."

    Another time, it was after the summer exams in 1945, when the students went to the bulletin board at the registrar's office to see their report cards. At that time, it was discovered that two people had failed a certain course. The preliminary exam scores on the report card were 80 and 70 points, but the actual scores obtained were 40 and 50 points respectively. They had both been deducted points. "Deduct points, why?" We looked very carefully at the student numbers of these two people, and it turned out that they were active members of the democratic movement in our department, and they often didn't attend classes. At this time, we turned to look at another report card. The scores of these two people were also 70 and 80 points, but there was no deduction. It turned out that this course was Mr. Wen's course. We knew that these two people sometimes left Kunming for work for weeks or even months at a time, and they couldn't attend Mr. Wen's classes, so why didn't Mr. Wen deduct their points? From this, we recognized two professors with different positions, and the two different attitudes they showed towards the democratic movement.

    After the agitation of those three years of revolutionary tide, a deep tacit understanding was formed between us and Mr. Wen. At that time, we were not yet accustomed to summarizing experiences and exchanging opinions, but many things we didn't need to say, and we understood in our hearts; we teachers and students could trust each other and understand each other. In this understanding and trust, I have already been unable to measure how many problems Mr. Wen had solved for us, and how much we had learned from Mr. Wen. It's like a stalk of sorghum or soybean, growing from early spring to early summer, who can measure how much sunshine and rain it has received?

    In the autumn of 1945, I was preparing to write my graduation thesis, and Mr. Wen was my advisor. One time, he called me to his home to talk, and asked me what topic I intended to write about. I said, "Writing a thesis for the first time is not only about learning to write, but mainly about hoping to deepen my understanding of Chinese literature. I would like to write about issues related to the people's character."

    He was smoking a pipe at this time, and smiled at me and said, "Your ambition is really not small. We don't have enough materials at hand now; besides, no matter how well you write, you won't be able to get it out (referring to the thesis review). You will write even more perfectly in the future. So, in my opinion, it's best to write about Tang poetry now, but the topic of 'people's character' is too obvious. Don't you see that many articles are talking about 'trends of thought'? Let's be more subtle, how about setting it as 'Literary Trends of Thought in Tang Poetry'?" I understood the full meaning of his words. I stood up, smiled, and said nothing. He said, "Good! Then go back and look at the relevant materials, and come back to me when you have drafted an outline."

    In this way, I sat in the large library for a month to look at relevant materials, and then took a three-page outline to consult Mr. Wen. I thought that this outline was very complete, because it wrote about the origins of Tang poetry, to its lasting influence, and the characteristics of various writers and the categorization of works were even marked with clear chapters. Who knew that when Mr. Wen was looking at this outline, his face sank, and then he put it on the table and turned back to look at me with a stern gaze, saying, "Why are you so vulgar too? If you write according to this outline, will it meet our original requirements?" Saying this, he picked up a brush, uncapped it, and dabbed it twice on the inkstone, watching my neatly written blue small characters being pierced into stripes by black lines, and in the end only a few punctuation marks remained. Mr. Wen wrote the word "Preface" under the original "I"; wrote "Starting from the An Lushan Rebellion" on "II"; and wrote "Society in Tang Poetry" on "III", with several sub-topics: (1) Farmers, (2) Military, (3) Women, (4) Merchants, (5) Intellectuals, (6) Others; then wrote the words "Conclusion" under "IV". Then he took a long breath and told me, "The preface and conclusion should not be too long, the An Lushan Rebellion is the main link, and the specific discussion of people's character should be placed on "III". Pay special attention to the Late Tang when reading the Complete Tang Poems." He handed me the outline, at this time his face turned kind again, and I heard hope in that voice, and said in a friendly tone like encouraging a child, "Take it, and write it well!" I withdrew, I felt that when I stepped into the threshold of my dormitory, my eyes still contained tears.

    Ten years ago, on the eve of my departure from Kunming, I went to Mr. Wen's house to say goodbye. We sat down opposite each other, and Mr. Wen began to give me this last lesson:

    "You know my character. When I was young, I was in constant distress and wandering, unable to find any way out. Reading 'Li Sao' and singing 'Man Jiang Hong' could not solve my specific problems. Today, we have the Communist Party. Your youth is so happy. I envy you." He pondered for a while and then said, "Have you seen a big change in me in the past two years? Yes, I am happy, healthy, and never tired. It is the power of the organization that supports me. Living in the organization, there is a kind of comradely love..."

    "I am very satisfied with my family. You know that. I love them, but this kind of love cannot satisfy me; what I demand is another kind of love. Now I have found it, and that is 'comradely love'. Ah! Comradely love is the most sublime, most sincere, and most profound love in the world. What can compare to it?" After thinking for a while, Mr. Wen said in English, "Only in passionate love!" After saying that, we both laughed, and he shook his head again and said, "No! It can only be said that there are some similar places, but it is definitely not it."

    In the past ten years, I have grown up in the organizational education, and in the cultivation and concern of comradely love that Mr. Wen experienced. I have indeed experienced a certain amount of hard life and intense struggle scenes, but my progress is still too slow, and the work I have done is still too little. For the sake of Mr. Wen and our common revolutionary cause, I should contribute more and make greater progress in the next decades. I have such confidence and strength, because I am Chinese, I am a Communist Party member, and I am a student of Wen Yiduo.

    忆闻一多先生
    康俔
    1943年秋，我由四川转学到昆明的富有革命传统的西南联合大学，在中文系向闻一多先生学习整整三年。从1943年9月，第一堂唐诗课起，到1946年5月，末一堂乐府诗止，三年中先生所开的每一门课我必选，每一堂课我必听；在各种会议上领会先生发言，在历次运动中追随先生行止；经常向先生质疑问难，不论在岗头村的家，昆华中学的家，我们南院女生宿舍隔壁的家，我总是跑进跑出的。
    在三年中，我看到先生怎样由学术走向政治，从课堂走向广场。但学术与政治是结合的，课堂与广场也并行在先生的生活里。在细致的、刻苦的钻研之后，他便试图运用马克思主义思想来分析中国文学和中国社会，就在那深湛而翔实的讲述中，使我们认识到千百年前的人民生活如何反映在光辉的文学作品里，而伟大的作家们又如何同人民血肉相连。谈到政治斗争的方向时，他总是结合当时形势并从历史上指出中国民族的优秀传统。
    谁都知道闻先生作为一个爱国诗人，作为一个激情的民主主义者绝不自当日始；但他之所以能够拍案而起，走向革命阵营，却是在参加民主同盟、全心全意接受共产党领导以后的事情。
    先生在一定组织中，在一定思想指导下，从事民主运动，因之他有力量，也有信心。事无巨细，只要是正义的，与革命事业有利的，他就不顾一切，挺身而出。
    “一二·一”运动后某个春天的晚上，我们中文系师生请一位刚从美国讲学回来的先生谈谈游美观感，这位先生大捧美国，大家听不下去。做主席的同学就接着问道：“听说美国也有贫民窟。他们的劳动人民究竟过着怎么样的生活？我们也很想知道。”不料这位先生马上就发了火，说：“我没有理由回答你的问题，我现在还有其他的事。”说着站起身来就走出了会场。这时候，闻先生从容不迫地站起来，发出了他那有力的声音。他说：“我们主席的发问是对的，那位先生应该正确地去重新认识美国内幕。他是我的老朋友，会后我还要当面去质问他，希望他改进。”
    又一次，是1945年暑期考试后，同学们到教务处布告栏去看成绩单。当时发现某一门课有两个人不及格，那成绩单的前项考试成绩是80分和70分，但在实得成绩栏中却是40分与50分了，他们都被扣了分。“扣分数，为什么呢？”我们又很仔细地看看这两人的学号，原来他俩正是我们系里从事民主运动的活跃分子，经常不到课堂听讲的人。这时候我们转看另一张成绩单，这两个人的分数也是70分和80分，但并没有扣除字样，原来这门课是闻先生的课。我们知道这两人为了工作有时整旬整月离开昆明，闻先生的课他们也上不成呀，为什么闻先生不扣他们的分数呢？从这里我们认识了两位立场不同的先生，对民主运动所表现的两种不同的态度。
    经过那三年革命浪潮的激荡，我们与闻先生之间形成了一种深长的默契，那时候我们尚不惯于总结经验、交换意见，可是很多事我们都不用说出来，心里就明白；我们师生间能够彼此信任，相互了解。就在这了解和信任中，我已经计量不出来先生曾为我们解决过多少问题，我们向先生学习过多少东西。那正如一株高粱或大豆，从早春长到初夏，谁能计量出它曾经接受过多少阳光和雨露呢？
    1945年秋季，我准备写毕业论文，闻先生作我的导师。有一次，他叫我到他家里谈，问我打算写什么题目。我说：“初次写论文不仅在学习写作，主要的是希望能加深自己对中国文学的认识，我很想写关于人民性方面的问题。”
    他这时烧着一斗烟，对我笑笑说：“你的野心真不小，现在我们手边的材料不够用；再说，你写得再好，也拿不出来（指论文审查）。将来再写，你会写得更完美的。那么，依我看现在最好是写唐诗，不过‘人民性’这题目太显露，你看很多文章不是都讲什么‘思潮’之类吗？我们也含蓄一点，就定为‘唐诗中的文艺思潮’如何？”我领会了他讲话的全部意义，我站起来，笑一笑什么也没说。他说：“好！那就回去看有关材料，拟成大纲时再来找我。”
    这样，我就坐了一个月的大图书馆，去看有关材料，以后捧着三页稿纸的大纲去请教先生。我自认为这大纲写得很完整，因为从唐诗的渊源，写到它的流风所及，至于各个作家的特点，作品的归类，更标志得章节分明。哪想到先生在看这大纲时脸色却沉下来，随后把它放在桌子上，回过头用严峻的目光注视着我说：“你，为什么也这样俗气？按这个提纲写下去，能符合我们原来的要求吗？”说着拿起一枝墨笔来，拔开笔帽在砚台上探了两下，眼看着我那些书法整齐的蓝色小字，就都被黑线给穿成条条，最后剩下的只有几个标点。先生在原来的“一”下写了一个“序”字；在“二”上写了“从天宝之乱说起”；在“三”上写出：“唐诗中之会社”，下分几个小题是（一）农民，（二）军旅，（三）妇女，（四）商人，（五）知识分子，（六）其他；随后在“四”下写出“结语”两个字。然后长长地抽了一口气，告诉我：“序和结语都不宜过长，天宝之乱是主要一环，而具体地谈人民性应放在“三”上，读全唐诗时要特别注意晚唐。”他把大纲递给我，这时候面色又转为慈和，我听出那声音中带有希望，并且用一种鼓励小孩子般的亲切语调说：“拿去，好好写吧！”我退出来，我感觉到我迈进自己宿舍的门坎时，我眼睛里仍含有泪。
    十年前，我离开昆明前夕，到先生家里去辞行。我们对面坐下来，先生便开始为我上这最后一课：
    “你知道我这性格，当我年轻的时候，整日在苦闷彷徨中，找不到任何出路，读‘离骚’、唱‘满江红’也解决不了我的具体问题。在今天，我们有了共产党，你们的青年时代，真太幸福，我羡慕你们。”他沉吟一会又说：“你看到我这两年来变化很大吗？是的，我愉快，健康，永不疲倦，是组织的力量在支持我，生活在组织中，有一种同志爱，……”
    “对我的家庭，我很满意，你是知道的。我爱她们，但是这种爱不能使我满足；我要求的是另一种爱，如今我找到了它，那就是‘同志爱’。啊！同志爱是人间最崇高、最真挚、最深刻的爱，什么能与它相比呢？”想了一想之后，先生用英文说了一句：“只有在热恋中！”说过后我们都大笑起来，他又摇摇头说：“不对！这只能说有某些近似的地方，而绝不是它。”
    十年来我在组织教育中，在闻先生所体验到的同志爱的培养与关切中成长起来，我确已经历过一定的艰苦生活和激烈的斗争场面，但我的进步还太慢，我所做的工作还太少。为着闻先生与我们共同的革命事业，我应该在此后的各个十年中贡献得更多，进步更大，我有这样的信心与力量，因为我是中国人，我是共产党员，我是闻一多的学生。
