    Using Blast Furnace Slag to Produce Cement
    Opens Up a Broad Path for Increasing Cement Production
    (Our News) The Benxi and Jinxi Cement Plants, under the Ministry of Building Materials Industry, have successfully experimented with using blast furnace slag in the raw materials to produce cement.
    The Benxi Cement Plant began using 32% blast furnace slag in its raw materials on June 17th. By June 27th, the average hourly output of two kilns had increased by 7.81 tons compared to May, exceeding the planned quota by 16.5%. It is estimated that by the end of the year, the plant can increase production by 29,000 tons of clinker or 58,000 tons of No. 400 slag cement. After using blast furnace slag, the cost per ton of clinker can also be reduced by 10%, saving the state 300,000 yuan by the end of the year. The Jinxi Cement Plant also achieved good results using the same method for trial production from June 21st to 27th.
    According to advanced Soviet experience, using blast furnace slag in cement raw materials is not only suitable for dry-process cement plants but also effective for wet-process cement plants. This trial at the Benxi Cement Plant proves that both water-quenched and un-water-quenched blast furnace slag can be used. Thus, using blast furnace slag to produce cement opens up a broad path for cement plants to increase production and reduce costs. The Ministry of Building Materials Industry is now working on further promoting this significant experience.

    用高炉矿渣生产水泥
    开辟了增产水泥的广阔道路
    本报讯　建筑材料工业部所属本溪、锦西两水泥厂，试验在原料中掺用高炉矿渣生产水泥，已获成功。
    本溪水泥厂从六月十七日起在原料中掺用32％的高炉矿渣，到六月二十七日止，有两台窑的平均小时产量比五月份提高7.81吨，超过计划定额16.5％。估计到年底可增产熟料二万九千吨或四百号矿渣水泥五万八千吨。掺用高炉矿渣后，每吨熟料的成本还可降低10％，到年底可为国家节省三十万元财富。锦西水泥厂从六月二十一日到二十七日采用上述办法试生产，也同样收到良好的效果。
    根据苏联先进经验，在水泥原料中掺用高炉矿渣，不仅适用于干法水泥厂，在湿法水泥厂也同样有效。本溪水泥厂这次试验证明，经水浇过的高炉矿渣可以使用，未经水浇过的高炉矿渣也同样可以使用。这样，利用高炉矿渣制造水泥，就为水泥厂增加产量、降低成本开辟了广阔的道路。现在建筑材料工业部正着手进一步推广这个重大经验。
