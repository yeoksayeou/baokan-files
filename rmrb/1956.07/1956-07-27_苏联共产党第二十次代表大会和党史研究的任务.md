Editorial by the Soviet "Historical Problems" Magazine

    In the current stage of communist construction, the Marxist-Leninist theory concerning the economy occupies a primary position. However, the study and propagation of the history of the Communist Party still plays a significant role in the Party's theoretical and propaganda activities. Correctly expounding the history of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and conducting a Marxist analysis of the Party's historically significant experience, is of great significance for the further development of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, for promoting the enthusiasm and initiative of Communist Party members, and for the fruitful activities of Communist and Workers' Parties in other countries.
    At the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the state of scientific research on Party history was sharply criticized. The representatives to the Congress correctly pointed out that the research on Party history and the history of Soviet society is one of the most backward parts of our ideological work.
    In the Party history works of the past two decades, the cult of personality has been very prominent. Everyone knows that Stalin was a famous activist in the Russian and world workers' movement. His contributions to the building of socialism in our country, to the struggle against the Trotskyites and right-wing opportunist factions hostile to Leninism, and to the propagation of Leninism and the demonstration of the Party's general line formulated by the Central Committee are undeniable. These achievements of Stalin earned him prestige within the Party and among the people. However, since the 1930s, the significance of his practical and theoretical activities has been exaggerated in many ways. The authors of many books, pamphlets, and papers did not explain the objective laws of social development, belittled the role of the Party and the people in the struggle for the victory of communism, and instead used Stalin's personal qualities to explain all the achievements of the Soviet Union. Stalin himself not only did not prevent this kind of praise, but even tried his best to encourage it.
    A wrong view has been formed that only Stalin could create and develop theory. Every word he said was described as a major scientific discovery, the pinnacle of Marxism, and an irrefutable truth. The activities of many scientific workers and social science teachers were nothing more than spreading the views that Stalin had expressed. This has led to the widespread dissemination of bookishness, dogmatism, and quoting scriptures. There appeared in science numb and uncreative people. They would not, and did not want to, think independently; they were only active within the scope of the "conclusions" and tried to use the prestige of others to cover up their scientific ignorance.
    The worship of Stalin directly distorted historical truth. This situation prevailed from the mid-1930s, when Beria's far-fetched and directly fabricated, anti-scientific, and harmful pamphlets about the Party organizations in Georgia and the South Caucasus appeared. All past works on Party history were rejected. The works of outstanding Party historians such as Ye.M. Yaroslavsky were also suspected, and other authors of Party history textbooks such as A.S. Bubnov, V.G. Knorin, V.I. Nevsky, and N.N. Popov were criticized, and their works were also discontinued.
    For seventeen years, the "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks) Short Course" has been the basis for the propagation of knowledge of Party history. This book systematized certain materials and described some important historical and theoretical questions of Bolshevism. However, many questions in Party history, especially those of the period after the October Revolution, are explained in the "Short Course" according to the idealistic views of the cult of personality. In the final chapters of the "Short Course," the role of the Party and the people is obviously belittled, and the road taken by the Party after the establishment of the Soviet regime is described as easy and smooth, without mentioning the many difficulties it overcame. In the "Short Course," the role of Lenin, the great founder and leader of the Communist Party and the Soviet state, is underestimated. There are many factual errors in this book.
    It is rightly said in the "Short Course" that Marxism is not a collection of dogmas, not a catechism, but a living and developing doctrine. However, every principle in the "Short Course" has been turned into a dead dogma. All scientific books, pamphlets, papers, and dissertations had to "conform" to this popular textbook. This treatment of the "Short Course" has caused serious damage to science. Party historians no longer accumulate and summarize new facts. People also expressed doubts about the significance of archival materials as historical primary sources, and many such documents were difficult for researchers to obtain. The work of managing the historical materials of the Party history was done very little. Publishing and criticizing new original materials was considered unnecessary, and even reprehensible. The vast majority of dissertations were nothing more than a patchwork of quotations and scattered facts, and most of them were repetitive. The compilation of Party history materials has ended, because past documents are considered to be of no value. The study of Party history has lost its scientific nature.
    The cadres of the Party were very satisfied with the proposal in the summary report made by the Central Committee to the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, that is: "It is necessary to write a popular Marxist textbook of Party history based on historical facts, which scientifically summarizes the historical experience of our Party's struggle for communism, and continues to the present."
    Obviously, we should not be limited to writing this textbook. At the same time, of course, we also need special studies and multi-volume Marxist works on Party history. The task of Soviet historians is to overcome the remnants of the cult of personality in their scientific research and teaching work, to accurately explain events, to restore Lenin's principles and conclusions, and to develop them creatively. Let us talk about several issues related to solving this task.

                          ★

    Up to now, many works on Party history of the pre-October Revolution period have been published. These works describe and summarize a lot of practical materials, but at the same time tolerate serious distortions of historical activities, tolerate arbitrary violations of Lenin's principles and conclusions.
    Many historical phenomena of this period have been studied very carelessly. For example, historians have not studied the complex process of the formation of the worldview of the first Marxists in Russia. Lenin pointed out that the workers' democracy could not be separated from the revolutionary democracy all at once, but had to go through a difficult and painful road. Many social democrats started their revolutionary activities as populists. It is regrettable that some authors have completely erased the revolutionary significance of the activities of the populists in the 1870s and 1880s, denied the inheritance in the development of the Russian revolutionary movement, and ignored Lenin's evaluation of the "legacy".
    The problem of the emergence of Marxism as a social ideological trend in Russia is often reduced to the issue of the introduction of Marx and Engels' works into Russia. Plekhanov's role in demonstrating Marxism in Russia has been underestimated. Often his early activities are reviewed from the fact that Plekhanov eventually developed into Menshevism. But how can we forget that Lenin, while criticizing Plekhanov's Menshevik views, highly praised many of his theoretical works! Everyone knows that Lenin believed that the establishment of the "Emancipation of Labor Group" was the foundation of the Russian Social Democratic Party. According to Lenin's opinion, it is necessary to reasonably study the history of the Marxist groups and the workers' movement in the 1880s, and to explore how the initial period of the development of Russian Social Democracy prepared the combination of Marxism and the workers' movement, which was first realized by the St. Petersburg "League of Struggle for the Emancipation of the Working Class" founded by Lenin.
    Party historians rarely reveal the connection between the Russian workers' movement and the world workers' movement. People have ignored Lenin's principle that the Russian workers' movement arose as part of the world workers' movement; the Russian Social Democratic Party considered the experience of Western European Social Democracy and also had a good influence on its development. According to this principle, and collecting concrete historical materials to illustrate why the Russian workers, who started the path of active political struggle later than the workers of other European countries, later became the vanguard of the world proletariat, is very important.
    In the "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks) Short Course", it is arbitrarily said that the ideological, organizational, tactical, and theoretical foundations of the Party are explained in Lenin's four works, namely: "What Is To Be Done?", "One Step Forward, Two Steps Back", "Two Tactics of Social-Democracy in the Democratic Revolution", and "Materialism and Empirio-criticism". Such a conclusion simplifies the formation and development of Bolshevism, and will not promote people to study Lenin's entire legacy in depth. The fundamental principles of our Party's ideology, organization, tactics, and theory were formed and developed not only in these works, but also in Lenin's other works and many resolutions of the Party. Leninism arose on the solid foundation of Marxism, and was developed in close connection with practice, with life, and on the basis of summarizing revolutionary experience. To study the history of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union is to point out the connection between the Party's theoretical activities and practical activities; to point out the developing Leninism.
    We have not fully and correctly explained how the Party formulated the program on the national question. Lenin's works had a decisive significance for the formulation of this program. According to the works of Marx and Engels, Lenin put forward and established the Bolshevik program for solving the national question, and constantly educated the workers and all the working people in the spirit of proletarian internationalism. Lenin resolutely opposed great-power chauvinism and local nationalism, and sharply criticized the nationalistic wavering and errors of the Bundists, the Caucasian federalists, the Ukrainian Social Democrats, and so on. He resolutely exposed the chauvinism of the Russian Black Hundreds and bourgeois parties, especially their anti-Semitism, pointing out that anti-Semitism is absolutely incompatible with the proletariat. It is regrettable that in the national question, Lenin's activities and the policies of the Bolshevik Party are not fully reflected in our works, and are one-sided.
    The history of the Party is full of the struggle for the unity of the workers' movement on a principled and revolutionary basis. However, some historians have simplified this struggle. They do not evaluate Menshevism as a faction hostile to Marxism within the workers' movement, and do not point out its evolution, but describe the Mensheviks as lackeys of the Tsarist autocracy, and do not talk about the union of Bolsheviks and Mensheviks from the end of 1905. Some comrades refuse to study the history of these united committees based on the fact that there were Mensheviks participating in the various committees of the Russian Social Democratic Labor Party. But can this erase the fact that these committees once existed? The task of historians is to explain, not to conceal historical facts.
    Historians have not paid due attention to the Party's struggle to create a broad alliance of all democratic forces during the bourgeois democratic revolution, and often explain the Bolsheviks' policies from a sectarian standpoint. The authors of many pamphlets and papers on the early period of the Russian Revolution did not take into account that the Bolsheviks, although the most thoroughly revolutionary force in the revolutionary democratic camp at that time, were not the only force. They ignored the fact that, on the one hand, the Bolsheviks criticized the incompleteness and pseudo-socialist nature of the petty-bourgeois parties, but at the same time formed alliances with them in order to launch a more effective attack on the Tsarist autocracy. Correctly understanding the Bolsheviks' policies is of great significance for foreign Communist and Workers' Parties to formulate current policies, and to overcome sectarian elements within the Party.
    In the works telling about the history of the Bolshevik Party during the period of the Great October Socialist Revolution and the Soviet era, there are particularly many shortcomings and errors. In the "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks) Short Course", as well as in many pamphlets and papers, the description of the Party's revolutionary struggle in 1917 is one-sided, and there are many inaccuracies in many places. In these works, the objective conditions of the Great October Socialist Revolution and the domestic and international situation at that time are very poorly explained. However, analyzing this situation is of decisive significance for determining the Bolshevik Party's tactics and its political and economic program.
    In the works on 1917, the role of Lenin as the initiator and organizer of the socialist revolution is explained very little. It is necessary to accurately explain the situation within the Party before Lenin's return to Russia, fully demonstrate the significance of the "April Theses" and the April Party Conference, the role Lenin played in formulating the Party's strategic policy at the Sixth Party Congress, and his leadership role in organizing and directly conducting the October armed uprising in Petrograd and throughout the country. In the "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks) Short Course", "History of the Soviet Civil War", and other works, Stalin's image is elevated to the primary position, belittling or not mentioning at all the activities of many outstanding Party workers (the heroes of the October Revolution), and rarely revealing the significance of the activities of the Petrograd Revolutionary Military Committee, which directly organized the uprising. Many works describe the transition from the bourgeois democratic revolution to the socialist revolution as a straight, continuously rising process. Due attention has not been paid to the issue of the peaceful development of the revolution (before July 1917). In fact, correctly explaining this issue has practical significance.
    Recently, the situation of the October Revolution in various places has begun to be studied more extensively, but the characteristics of the historical process in various regions are not analyzed enough, especially the difficulties encountered on the road to establishing Soviet power in various ethnic minority areas of our country. Often the process of the proletarian revolution in Ukraine or Central Asia is described in the same way as in the central provinces of Russia. Often the tactics of the Bolsheviks in different regions are described as uniform, and studied according to a formula. In this way, the explanation of the historical process seems empty and poor, and cannot make people deeply understand Lenin's national policy.
    In the works on the history of the civil war, the cult of personality is particularly evident. In his "Biography" and other works, Stalin illegally described himself as the direct organizer and inspirer of the Red Army's most significant victories, and as the creator of basic strategic plans. For example, in order to put Stalin's role in the primary position, the significance of the Tsaritsyn front in 1918 for the future of the Soviet state was exaggerated, and it was described as the place where the main blow of the counter-revolution was suffered. In fact, the most important front at that time was in the East. Lenin pointed out more than once that it was the Eastern Front that determined the fate of the revolution. Historians have the mission of restoring the truth, and should explain the leading role of the Communist Party and the Central Committee of the Party, the heroism shown by the broad masses of working people in the struggle against armed interventionists and White bandit troops, and the achievements of outstanding Red Army commanders and political workers (which were not just Stalin's alone). In the works of recent years, the names of V.A. Antonov-Ovseyenko, V.K. Blucher, A.S. Bubnov, Y.B. Gamarnik, A.I. Yegorov, S.S. Kamenev, M.S. Kedrov, M.L. Rukhimovich, I.S. Unshlikht, and many other comrades, who did a lot of work for the consolidation of the Red Army and its effective activities, are not mentioned at all.
    Some historical works were influenced by Stalin's famous assertion in his letter to Colonel Razin, according to which Lenin was not a "military expert" and said that "he was too late to study military affairs." This assertion is incorrect. The leader of the Central Political Bureau of the Russian Communist Party and the Council of Workers' and Peasants' Defense was Lenin, who directly engaged in military activities, and led the organization of military defeat of the enemy.
    In the works of our historians, the heroic struggle of the Party and the working masses to create a socialist society is rarely reflected. The descriptions of some issues related to socialist construction in these works are one-sided and incorrect. They often cover up the difficulties that the Party and the Soviet people overcame in the struggle for the victory of socialism. Not talking about the shortcomings, mistakes, and weaknesses in the activities of the Party and Soviet organizations, or attributing these to the enemy's conspiracy, and describing the road of the Party's struggle for the victory of socialism as a celebration march with one victory after another, reduces the achievements of the Party, which is good at overcoming and is overcoming great difficulties. Some authors have forgotten that the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the working class of the Soviet Union are advancing along a road that no one has ever walked before, and are the first in the world to establish a brand-new socialist system. The Party determines its policies based on practical experience. After summarizing the experience, the Party made significant changes to its policies.
    We have almost no works studying the history of the formulation of Lenin's plan for socialist construction. This plan was not made all at once. It is necessary to study the vast ideological legacy included in Lenin's many works and the Party's resolutions, and point out how the Party summed up practical experience and formulated the guidelines for socialist construction. We must correct the phenomenon of ignoring Lenin's cooperative plan, because the implementation of this plan is of decisive significance for the socialist transformation of agriculture. It must be pointed out that Lenin, based on the theory of Marx and Engels, studied the complex economic and social processes in the country, and considered the practical activities experience of the Party, the state, and the masses themselves, and formulated, verified, and refined the theory of socialist transformation of agriculture in a long process.
    In implementing the plan for socialist construction, the Party has solved and is solving complex economic tasks. It is regrettable that, in the Party history works, the struggle of the Party to solve these tasks is understood very superficially, and sometimes it is simply extremely wrong. Many published works and dissertations prove that the authors of these works lack economic knowledge. The 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union pointed out the necessity of educating cadres with economic knowledge, which is also very necessary for Party historians.
    Many books and dissertations describing the Party's activities in national industrialization, agricultural collectivization, and cultural revolution only describe the resolutions related to these works and list the results of the implementation of the resolutions. But from the adoption of the resolutions to the implementation of the resolutions and the achievement of results, the Party has to go through a lot of intense activities in many ways. The task of historians is to study under what circumstances the Party made those resolutions and why it was necessary to adopt those resolutions, and mainly to deeply analyze the struggle of the Party and the working masses to implement the Party's line.
    In the Party history works, the experience of the Party in leading the working masses is rarely explained, the art of the Party in discovering and protecting the buds of new things and how the Party inspires the initiative of the workers is rarely explained. Our Party not only teaches the masses but also learns from them; carefully observes every manifestation of the initiative and creativity of the workers and peasants in the revolutionary transformation of society. We must recall how the Party supported the initiatives of Communist Saturdays, shock brigades, and Stakhanov workers. The creation of machine tractor stations was also inspired by the experience of the masses and the initiatives of workers in Ukrainian state farms.
    There are many dissertations and pamphlets describing the labor enthusiasm of the masses in the struggle to build a communist society. However, many of them are composed of accidental figures and facts; they list names and repeat the reports on the implementation of the contracts and guarantee conditions of the socialist competition. But it is more important to study and describe how the Party organization, based on the experience, initiative, and pioneering spirit of the masses, found better ways to mobilize the enthusiasm of the workers in the struggle to realize national industrialization and agricultural collectivization, and how the Party organized and led the socialist competition.
    The strength of the Communist Party lies in the unity within the Party, in its solidarity. The Party formed and maintained this unity in a resolute and irreconcilable struggle against the enemies of Leninism. It cannot be considered normal that our historians have stopped studying the history of the inner-Party struggle in the period after the October Revolution in recent years. They simply regarded the anti-Leninist activities of the Trotskyites, rightists, and nationalists as the activities of the lackeys of foreign spy agencies. The failure to expose the Trotskyites' and right-wing opportunists' opposition to the Party's general line and Leninism represents the interests of the resisting exploiting classes and the sentiments of the petty-bourgeois strata in the population. The great ideological struggle waged by the Party against phenomena that violated Leninism has not been clarified. It should be known that it was this struggle that had a decisive significance for isolating the leaders of the anti-Leninist groups and uniting millions of workers around the Party's general line.
    In March 1937, Stalin made a report at the plenary meeting of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) entitled "On the shortcomings of Party work and the methods of eliminating Trotskyite double-dealers and other double-dealers". In this report, he put forward a principle that was theoretically wrong and practically harmful: every step forward we take will sharpen the class struggle in the country. This principle was put forward in a situation where there were no longer any antagonistic classes in the Soviet Union. It mistakenly guided the work of the Party and Soviet organs, caused unwarranted repression, and caused great losses to the Communist Party and the state of the Soviet Union.
    It was precisely during this period that Lenin's norms of Party life were further violated, administrative means became popular, and the initiative of the masses declined. In the Party and Soviet organs, there appeared despicable sycophants who tried to get promoted by suppressing all the cadres who were loyal to the cause of socialism. Under the guise of strengthening vigilance, these unscrupulous careerists spread suspicion and distrust in the ranks of the Party. The destruction of the principle of collective leadership of the Party contributed to the emergence and spread of similar situations. However, the fact that the Soviet state developed forward at this time clearly shows the strength of the Party and the people. The Party's line of further improving the socialist economy and culture and improving the welfare of the workers was correct. Millions of Communist Party members and tens of millions of workers, under the leadership of the Party organizations, fought wholeheartedly to complete the plan for socialist construction and achieved major achievements.
    Up to now, the Party history of the Great Patriotic War period has not been studied enough. When writing on this subject, historians often repeat the words in the "Biography of Stalin", which is full of the cult of personality, or uncritically adopt the principles in Stalin's book "On the Great Patriotic War of the Soviet Union", many of which need to be reviewed. For example, it has been pointed out in our newspapers that it is wrong to regard the early period of the Great Patriotic War as a period of active defense, and it has been pointed out that the history of the war must be described truthfully, and it is not allowed to erase the mistakes, difficulties, and failures of the Soviet army in 1941 to 1942.
    In many works, mainly the process of war activities is explained, while the activities of Party organizations, the work of the rear, the struggle of the guerrillas, the foreign policy of the Party and the Soviet government, and other important issues are given little attention, to the point of being intolerable. In our works, the historical victory of the Soviet Union over Hitler's Germany is entirely attributed to Stalin's leadership. This subjective explanation of the reasons for our victory is extremely incorrect. In fact, the victory was won by the Party and the entire people, the glorious Soviet army, whose leaders were the talented commanders selected by the Party and the people.
    The activities of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in the post-war years should be explained extremely accurately and comprehensively, and the upsurge of mass labor enthusiasm should be pointed out; under the leadership of the Party organizations, they overcame many difficulties and restored and advanced the national economy of our country in a very short period of time. It is important to point out these. But at the same time, it should also be pointed out that the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union revealed the serious mistakes made by the Party and the state leadership in the post-war years (the prevalence of the cult of personality, the destruction of inner-Party democracy, Soviet democracy, and socialist legal system, the mistakes made in implementing Lenin's national policy, the backwardness of technological development in many industrial sectors, the neglect of agriculture, etc.). The measures taken by the Central Committee and the decisions of the Twentieth Party Congress were precisely to correct these shortcomings.
    The history of the local Party organizations must be studied. Until now, there has been no work describing the history of such large Party organizations as Moscow, Leningrad, and Ukraine. It is particularly important to correctly explain the history of the Bolsheviks in the South Caucasus; the fabrications and distortions existing in the published works should be exposed. It should be seen that without accumulating and summarizing the historical materials of the local Party organizations, it is impossible to write a scientific Party history.
    The history of the Party is a part of the history of the whole people. All activities, policies, and tactics of the Party are determined by the objective historical process and the domestic and international situation. It is precisely because of this that, in order to correctly study the history of the Party, it is necessary to deeply understand the economic and political history of our country and other countries. In this way, we will be able to successfully solve many problems in Party history, especially the problem of the periodization of Party history. The periodization method of the "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks) Short Course" has been opposed, and many places in it need to be reviewed.
    Mastering Lenin's great ideological legacy is of decisive significance for truly explaining Party history with Marxism. It cannot be said that Lenin's remarks are not mentioned in the Party history works. No, words from Lenin's works are quoted quite a lot. The bad thing is that the quotations are often formalistic and dogmatic. Party historians rarely study the works of Marx and Engels, the founders of scientific socialism. N.K. Krupskaya said in her memoirs that Lenin often "consulted Marx". Party historians must often "consult" Marx, Engels, and Lenin, deeply study their ideas, and follow their methods.
    The 20th Congress of the Party correctly pointed out that the use of Lenin's legacy has been hampered. Many works that were printed in the previous editions of the "Complete Works of Lenin" and "Collected Works of Lenin" were not included in the fourth edition of the "Complete Works of Lenin". The reference materials in the fourth edition are very few, and the annotations are also very brief. Nearly a thousand kinds of Lenin's works and documents were printed into hundreds of single editions. In fact, it is difficult for scientific workers and teachers of higher education to obtain them. This situation is intolerable. A complete collection of Lenin's works should have been published long ago.
    The situation of the works on Lenin's life is also not satisfactory to us. The second edition of "Lenin's Biography", which was recently released, is written in dry, uninteresting, and unenthusiastic language. Many principles in this book are extracted from the "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks) Short Course". In this book, the cult of personality of Stalin has not been overcome. An excellent and correct biography of this great leader and mentor of all the working people should be written as soon as possible. There has long been a need for a large-scale scientific biography of Lenin, and it is necessary to seriously study his activities in different periods of the Party's development.
    To study the history of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, one cannot but carefully study the Party's documents. Unfortunately, our historians have paid little attention to this kind of historical material. Many shorthand reports and records of Party congresses and conferences have become rare books. The "Compilation of Resolutions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union" published in 1953 has shortcomings. The explanations about the various congresses and conferences published on it are repeating the "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks) Short Course". They are not helpful to readers to understand the environment and resolutions of the congresses and conferences.
    In order to truly scientifically study Party history, it is necessary to deeply study newspapers, archival materials, and statistical data, etc. But until now, many important materials have not been released to researchers, and some documents are kept secret for no sufficient reason. Good conditions have now been created for the use of archival work, and historians should make full use of these conditions. The Institute of Marxism-Leninism of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (formerly the Institute of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin) has the mission of publishing a large number of compilations of Party history documents and specialized works.
    The memoirs of old Bolsheviks and participants in the revolutionary movement are valuable historical materials. It is regrettable that, in our country, the work of collecting and publishing memoirs, especially memoirs of the Soviet period, has been done very poorly. The Institute of Party History had carried out beneficial work in this area when it existed, but this work was not continued and further developed. It is necessary to restore the work of publishing memoirs, and to reprint those memoirs that have become rare books.
    Having a center to guide the scientific development of Party history is of great significance for the scientific research of Party history. The Institute of Marxism-Leninism of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and its branches in various places should become such a center. The Party History Teaching and Research Sections of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Basic Teaching and Research Sections of Marxism-Leninism in various universities and colleges are conducting some scientific research work, but the Ministry of Higher Education of the Soviet Union has not seriously led this work.

                          ★

    Studying and propagating the history of the Party founded by the great Lenin is a glorious cause with great responsibility. We have many capable researchers and teachers here. They are all solving new tasks with a high sense of responsibility to the Party. It is important to help the Party history workers thoroughly overcome the cult of personality, bookishness, and dogmatism, and to build all their work on the basis of creative Marxism-Leninism.
    Our magazine should play a great role in this regard. The "Historical Problems" magazine has paid little attention to the study of Party history until now, and the papers on such subjects published in the magazine still contain the common errors and shortcomings of our Party history works. We believe that our task is to publish papers on the most important and less studied issues in Party history in the magazine, and to analyze the errors and shortcomings of the published works on Party history, and to carry out serious, realistic, and sincere criticism and self-criticism. This is helpful for correctly evaluating the past and formulating an active and practical work program. At the same time, it has long been urgently requested to re-publish a specialized magazine on Party history issues.
    Soviet historians are transforming their work in the spirit of the historical decisions of the Twentieth Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. This transformation does not mean jumping from one extreme to another. Overcoming the worship of individual figures does not mean removing quotations and erasing names. The problem lies in accurately explaining the historical process and the role of individual figures with Marxism.
    The transformation of the work of Party historians should be in-depth, organized, and well-thought-out, and should never be regarded as a hasty movement. Many specific historical issues cannot be solved all at once. It is never possible to rely on the "panacea"-style instructions or "indicative" articles that our cadres have become accustomed to, to solve these problems. To correctly solve these pressing problems, we must first rely on the collective efforts of historians, free exchange of opinions, creative debates, and serious scientific research. We should start working in new ways more boldly and eliminate all obstacles on the road to scientific creation.
    The Party's Twentieth Congress clearly defined our tasks. We must eliminate bookishness and dogmatism, seriously follow Lenin's doctrine and Lenin's methods, create scientific works full of new ideas, full of creative enthusiasm, and a spirit of diligent study, and use them to promote the victory of communism.

      (Translated by Zhang Yunhou from the third issue of "Historical Problems" magazine in 1956)

    苏联共产党第二十次代表大会和党史研究的任务
    苏联“历史问题”杂志社论
    在共产主义建设的现阶段，马克思列宁主义有关经济方面的理论占有首要的地位。但是在共产党的理论活动和宣传活动中，共产党历史的研究和宣传仍有很大的作用。正确地阐述苏联共产党的历史，对党的具有世界历史意义的经验进行马克思主义的分析，这对于苏联共产党的进一步发展，对于发扬共产党员的积极性和主动精神，对于其他国家的共产党和工人党的卓有成效的活动具有很大的意义。
    在苏联共产党第二十次代表大会上，党史的科学研究的情况受到了尖锐的批评。代表大会的代表们正确地指出：党史和苏维埃社会史的研究是我们思想工作中最落后的部分之一。
    在近二十年来的党史著作中，个人崇拜表现得非常突出。大家都知道，斯大林是俄国和世界工人运动的著名活动家。在我国建成社会主义方面，在同敌视列宁主义的托洛茨基分子和右倾机会主义派别进行斗争方面，在宣传列宁主义和论证中央委员会所制定的党的总路线方面，他的功绩是不容置辩的。斯大林的这些功绩使他在党内和人民中间获得了声望。但是从三十年代起，他的实践和理论的活动的意义被多方地夸大了。许多书籍、小册子和论文的作者没有说明社会发展的客观规律性，贬低了党和人民在争取共产主义胜利的斗争中的作用，而用斯大林个人的特殊品质来解释苏联的一切成就。斯大林本人不但不加以阻止，反而竭力鼓励对自己的这种颂扬。
    曾经形成了一种错误的看法，好像只有斯大林才能创造和发展理论。他的每一句话，都被说成是科学上的重大发现、登峰造极的马克思主义和不容置辩的真理。许多科学工作者和社会科学教师们的活动，不外是传播斯大林所发表过的意见。这就使书呆子习气、教条主义和引经据典的习气广泛地传播开来。在科学中出现了麻木不仁和毫无创见的人们。他们不会，也不想独立思考；他们只是在“定论”的范围内活动，并且企图用别人的威望来掩护自己在科学上的无知。
    对斯大林的崇拜，使历史的真相直接受到歪曲。从三十年代中期，贝利亚所写的关于格鲁吉亚和南高加索党组织的牵强附会和直接捏造的、反科学的、有害的小册子出现时起，这种情形就占了上风。一切过去的有关党史的著作都遭到了排斥。像叶·姆·雅罗斯拉夫斯基这样卓越的党史学家的著作也遭到怀疑，其他党史教科书的作者如：阿·斯·布勃诺夫、弗·格·克诺林、弗·伊·涅夫斯基、恩·恩·波波夫都遭到非难，他们的著作也被停止使用了。
    十七年来，“联共（布）党史简明教程”一书一直是宣传党史知识的根据。这本书把某些材料系统化了，并叙述了布尔什维主义历史上和理论上的某些重要问题。但是党史上的许多问题，特别是十月革命以后时期的问题，在“联共（布）党史简明教程”中是根据个人崇拜的唯心主义见解来说明的。在“简明教程”的最后几章，党和人民的作用显然是被贬低了，苏维埃政权建立以后党所经过的道路被说成是轻松容易的，它所克服的许多困难却没有提到。在“简明教程”中，低估了共产党和苏维埃国家的伟大奠基人和领导者列宁的作用。在这本书里有不少史实上的错误。
    在“简明教程”中说得很对，马克思主义不是教条的堆集，不是教义问答，而是活生生的发展的学说。但是“简明教程”中的每一条原理都被变成了死的教条。一切科学书籍、小册子、论文、学位论文都要同这本通俗的教科书“吻合”。这样对待“简明教程”就给科学带来了严重的损害。党史学家不再积累和概括新的事实。人们对作为历史原始资料的档案材料的意义也表示怀疑，而且这样的文献有许多是研究工作者很难得到的。党史的史料管理工作做得很少。发表和批判新的原始材料被认为是不必要的，甚至是该受责备的。绝大多数的学位论文无非是由引文和零碎的事实拚凑起来的，并且大多数都是互相重复的。党史史料的编纂工作已经结束了，因为过去的文献，被认为是没有任何价值的。党史的研究失去了科学性。
    党的干部对于中央委员会在向苏联共产党第二十次代表大会作的总结报告中的提议非常满意，这就是：“必须编写一本通俗的、以历史事实为依据的马克思主义的党史教科书，其中要科学地概括地叙述我们党为共产主义而斗争的具有全世界历史性的经验，并且一直叙述到现在”。
    显然，不应当只限于编写这一本教科书。同时当然也需要专题研究，需要多卷本的马克思主义的党史著作。苏维埃历史学家的任务在于：在自己的科学研究和教学工作中，克服个人崇拜的残余，确切地阐明事件，恢复列宁的原理和论断，并创造性地加以发展。下面我们就来谈一谈与解决这项任务有关的几个问题。
                          ★
    到现在为止，已经发表过很多有关十月革命以前时期的党史的著作。在这些著作中叙述和概括了许多实际材料，但同时却容忍对历史活动的严重的歪曲，容忍任意违反列宁的原理和论断。
    这一时期的许多历史现象都研究得很马虎。例如，历史学家们没有研究俄国最初的马克思主义者的世界观形成的复杂过程。列宁曾指出，工人的民主主义不能一下子由革命的民主主义中分化出来，而是要经过艰难和痛苦的道路的。许多社会民主党人是作为民粹派而开始自己的革命活动的。遗憾的是，某些作者竟完全抹杀了七十到八十年代的民粹派活动的革命意义，否定了俄国革命运动发展中的继承性，忽视了列宁对于“遗产”的评价。
    马克思主义作为一个社会思想流派在俄国出现的问题常常被弄成了马克思和恩格斯的著作传入俄国的问题。普列哈诺夫在俄国论证马克思主义所起的作用被低估了。常常从普列哈诺夫最后发展到孟什维主义这一事实出发来审查他的早期活动。但是，列宁在批评普列哈诺夫的孟什维主义观点的同时，还高度地评价了他的许多理论著作，这一点怎能忘掉呢！大家都知道，列宁认为
  “劳动解放社”的建立是俄国社会民主党的基础。应当根据列宁的意见来合理地研究八十年代马克思主义小组和工人运动的历史，探究俄国社会民主主义发展的最初时期如何准备了马克思主义和工人运动的结合，这种结合最初是由列宁所创立的彼得堡“工人阶级解放斗争协会”来实现的。
    党史学家很少揭示俄国工人运动和世界工人运动的联系。人们忽略了列宁的这样一个原理，即：俄国工人运动是作为世界工人运动的一部分而产生的；俄国社会民主党是考虑了西欧社会民主主义的经验并且也对它的发展起了良好的影响。根据这个原理，并且搜集具体的历史材料来说明为什么比其他欧洲国家的工人较晚走上积极的政治斗争道路的俄国工人，在后来竟成了世界无产阶级的先锋队，这是很重要的。
    在“联共（布）党史简明教程”中武断地说，党的思想、组织、策略和理论的基础是在列宁的四部著作中得到阐明的，即：“做什么？”、“进一步，退两步”、“社会民主党在民主革命中的两个策略”、“唯物主义和经验批判主义”。这样的论断把布尔什维主义的形成和发展简单化了，这样不会推动人们去深入研究列宁的全部遗产。我们党的思想、组织、策略和理论的根本原则并不只是在这些著作中，而是同时在列宁的其他著作和党的许多决议中形成和发展起来的。列宁主义是在马克思主义的坚实基础上产生的，是在同实践，同生活的密切联系中，依据对于革命经验的概括而发展的。研究苏联共产党的历史，就是要指出党的理论活动和实际活动的联系；指出在发展中的列宁主义。
    我们并没有完全正确地阐明党如何制定了关于民族问题的纲领。列宁的著作对于这个纲领的制定有着决定的意义。列宁根据马克思和恩格斯的著作，提出并确立了解决民族问题的布尔什维主义的纲领，并以无产阶级的国际主义精神不断地教育工人和所有的劳动者。列宁坚决反对大国沙文主义和地方民族主义，尖锐地批评了崩得分子、高加索的联邦主义者、乌克兰社会民主党人等等的民族主义的动摇情绪和错误。他坚决地揭穿了俄国黑帮和资产阶级政党的沙文主义，特别是他们的反犹太人主义，指出反犹太人主义是和无产阶级绝不相容的。遗憾的是，在民族问题方面，列宁的活动和布尔什维克党的政策，在我国的著作中反映得不完全，而且片面。
    党的历史充满了在有原则的、革命的基础上争取工人运动团结一致的斗争。但是某些历史学家却把这个斗争简单化了。他们不把孟什维主义评为在工人运动内部同马克思主义敌对的流派，没有指出它的演变，却把孟什维克说成是沙皇专制制度的走狗，并且完全不谈从1905年末开始的布尔什维克和孟什维克联合的问题。有些同志拒绝根据在俄国社会民主工党的各委员会中有孟什维克参加这个事实去研究这些统一委员会的历史。但是难道这样就可以抹杀这些委员会曾经存在过的事实吗？历史学家的任务是要说明，而不是隐讳历史事实。
    历史学家对于党在资产阶级民主革命时期为创立一切民主力量的广泛联盟而进行的斗争没有给予应有的注意，并且常常从宗派主义立场去说明布尔什维克的政策。许多关于俄国革命初期的小册子和论文的作者，没有考虑到布尔什维克在当时虽是革命民主阵营中最彻底革命的力量，但并不是唯一的力量。他们忽视了这个事实，就是：布尔什维克一方面批评小资产阶级政党的不彻底性和冒充社会主义的性质，但同时却同他们结成联盟，以便向沙皇专制制度展开更有效的攻击。正确了解布尔什维克的政策，对于外国共产党和工人党制定当前政策，以及战胜党内的宗派主义分子，有着很大的意义。
    在讲述有关伟大十月社会主义革命时期和有关苏维埃时代的布尔什维克党的历史的著作中，缺点和错误特别多。在“联共（布）党史简明教程”，以及许多小册子和论文中，对于党在1917年的革命斗争的叙述是片面的，并且有许多地方是不正确的。在这些著作中，对于伟大的十月社会主义革命的客观条件，对于当时的国内外局势讲得非常不够。但是分析这种局势对于确定布尔什维克党的策略及其政治和经济纲领具有决定意义。
    在关于1917年的著作中，对列宁作为社会主义革命的倡导者和组织者的作用阐明得很少。必须确切地说明在列宁回到俄国以前的党内情况，充分表明“四月提纲”和四月党代表会议的意义、列宁在制定党的第六次代表大会的策略方针时所起的作用、他在组织和直接进行彼得格勒和全国的十月武装起义当中的领导作用。在“联共
  （布）党史简明教程”、“苏联国内战争史”以及其他著作中，都把斯大林的形象抬到首要的地位，贬低了或者根本不提许多卓越的党的工作者（十月革命的英雄们）的活动，很少揭示直接组织起义的彼得堡革命军事委员会活动的意义。许多著作都把资产阶级民主革命向社会主义革命的转变描写成直线的，不断上升的过程。对于革命和平发展的问题（在1917年7月以前），没有给予应有的注意。其实正确地说明这个问题是有现实意义的。
    最近已经开始更为广泛地研究各地在十月革命时的情况，但是对于各个地区的历史进程的特点却分析得不够，特别是没有指出在我国各个民族边区创立苏维埃政权的道路上所遇到的困难。常常把乌克兰或中央亚细亚的无产阶级革命过程描写得和俄国的中央省份一样。常常把布尔什维克在不同地区的策略描写成清一色的，并且按照一个公式来研究。这样一来，对历史过程的说明就显得空洞贫乏，而且不能使人深入了解列宁的民族政策。
    在有关国内战争史的著作中，个人崇拜表现得特别明显。斯大林在“传略”和其他著作中，非法地把自己说成是红军最重大胜利的直接组织者和鼓舞者，说成是基本的战略计划的创造者。例如，为了把斯大林的作用摆在首要地位，就夸大了1918年的察里津战线对于苏维埃国家前途的意义，把它说成是受到反革命主要打击的地点。其实，当时最重要的战线是在东方。列宁曾不止一次地指出，决定革命命运的正是东方战线。历史学家负有恢复真相的使命，并应阐明共产党和党中央委员会的领导作用、广大劳动人民在反对武装干涉者和白卫匪军的斗争中所表现的英雄主义以及杰出的红军指挥员和政治工作者的功绩
  （这功绩不是斯大林一个人的）。在最近几年的著作中，根本不提弗·阿·安东诺夫—奥夫谢延柯、弗·克·勃留赫尔、阿·斯·布勃诺夫、雅·勃·加马尔尼克、阿·伊·叶果罗夫、斯·斯·卡麦涅夫、马·斯·凯德罗夫、马·尔·鲁希莫诺维奇、伊·斯·乌恩什里赫特和许多别的同志的名字，而他们对于红军的巩固和它的有效活动是做了很多工作的。
    某些历史著作受到斯大林在给拉津上校的信中所做的著名论断的影响，按照这个论断，列宁似乎不是“精通军事的人”，并且说“他研究军事已经晚了”。这种论断是不正确的。俄国共产党中央政治局和工农国防委员会的领导者是列宁，他直接从事军事活动，并且领导了在军事上粉碎敌人的组织工作。
    在我们历史学家的著作中，对党和劳动群众为创立社会主义社会而进行的英勇斗争很少反映。这些著作对某些有关社会主义建设的问题的叙述是片面的和不正确的。它们经常掩盖党和苏联人民在争取社会主义胜利的斗争中所克服的困难。不谈党和苏维埃组织的活动中的缺点、错误和弱点，或者把这些归咎于敌人的阴谋，把党为争取社会主义胜利而斗争的道路描写成一个胜利接一个胜利的庆祝游行，这就降低了善于克服并且正在克服着巨大困难的党的功绩。有些作者忘记了苏联共产党和苏联的工人阶级是沿着从来没有人走过的道路前进的，并且是在世界上第一个建立起崭新的社会主义制度的。党是根据实际经验来确定自己的政策的。党总结了经验后，就对自己的政策实行重大的改变。
    在我们这里几乎没有研究制定列宁社会主义建设计划的历史的著作。这个计划不是一下子就做出来的。必须研究包括在列宁的许多著作中和党的决议中的大量思想遗产，指出党怎样总结了实际经验而拟定出社会主义建设的方针。一定要纠正忽视列宁的合作社计划的现象，因为这个计划的实行对农业的社会主义改造是有决定的意义的。必须指出，列宁是根据马克思和恩格斯的理论，研究了国内的复杂的经济和社会的过程，并且考虑了党、国家和群众本身的实际活动经验，在长期的过程中制定了农业的社会主义改造的理论，并且加以检验和精确化的。
    党在实行社会主义建设的计划时，过去和现在都解决着复杂的经济任务。遗憾的是，在党史著作中，对于党为解决这些任务而进行的斗争了解得极为肤浅，有时简直是极端错误的。许多已发表的著作和学位论文证明，这些著作的作者是缺乏经济知识的。苏联共产党第二十次代表大会指出了对干部进行经济知识教育的必要性，这对党史学家说来也是十分必要的。
    有许多叙述党在国家工业化方面、农业合作化方面和文化革命方面的活动的书籍和学位论文，只是叙述了有关这些工作的决议和列举决议执行的结果。但从通过决议到执行决议和取得成绩，是要经过党在多方面的紧张活动的。历史学家的任务是研究党在什么情况下作出那些决议和为什么必须通过那些决议，而主要是要深刻分析党和劳动群众为实现党的路线而进行的斗争。
    在党史的著作中很少说明党领导劳动群众的经验，很少说明党发现和保护新事物的幼芽的艺术和党怎样启发劳动者的主动精神。我们党不仅教导群众而且还向他们学习；仔细观察工人和农民在社会的革命改造中的主动精神和创造性的每一个表现。我们要回想一下，党是如何支持共产主义星期六、突击队员和斯达哈诺夫工作者的创举的。机器拖拉机站的创建也受到了群众经验和乌克兰国营农场工人的创举的启发。
    有很多的学位论文和小册子描写群众在为建设共产主义社会的斗争中的劳动积极性。但是其中很多都是由偶然的数字和事实构成的；列举了姓名，复述了社会主义竞赛的合同和保证条件执行情况的汇报。但更重要的是要研究和叙述党组织如何根据群众的经验，主动性和首创精神，找到更好的方式去动员劳动者在为实现国家工业化和农业集体化的斗争中的积极性以及党如何组织和领导社会主义竞赛。
    共产党的力量在于党内的团结，在于它的统一。党在同列宁主义的敌人进行坚决不调和的斗争中形成和维护了这个统一。不能认为这个事实是正常的：我们的历史学家在近几年来已停止研究十月革命以后时期的党内斗争的历史。他们把托洛茨基分子、右倾分子、民族主义者的反列宁主义的活动简单地看成外国间谍机关走狗的活动。没有揭发托洛茨基分子和右倾机会主义分子反对党的总路线和列宁主义的活动，是代表着进行反抗的剥削阶级的利益和居民中的小资产阶层的情绪。没有说清党为反对违背列宁主义的现象而进行的巨大思想斗争。要知道，正是这个斗争对于孤立反列宁主义集团的领袖和把千百万劳动者团结在党的总路线周围具有决定的意义。
    1937年3月斯大林在联共（布）中央委员会全体会议上，做了题为“论党的工作缺点和消灭托洛茨基两面分子及其他两面分子的办法”的报告。他在这个报告中提出了一个在理论上是错误的、在实践上是有害的原理：我们的每一步进展都将使国内的阶级斗争尖锐化。这个原理是在苏联已经没有敌对阶级存在的情况下提出的。它错误地指引了党和苏维埃机关的工作，引起了毫无根据的镇压，使苏联共产党和国家遭到很大的损失。
    正是在这个时期，列宁的党内生活准则就更加遭到破坏，单纯行政手段得以流行，群众的主动性消沉下去了。在党和苏维埃机关中出现了卑鄙的趋炎附势的人，他们力图借助于镇压一切忠实于社会主义事业的干部而获得提拔。在加强警惕性的幌子下，这些钻营无耻的人在党的队伍中散布怀疑和不信任。党的集体领导原则的破坏助长了类似情况的出现和传播。但是苏维埃国家在这个时候向前发展的事实清楚地说明了党和人民的力量。党的进一步提高社会主义的经济和文化、增进劳动者福利的路线是正确的。数百万的共产党员和千千万万的劳动者在党组织的领导下全心全意地为完成社会主义建设的计划而斗争，并且获得了重大的成就。
    到现在为止，对于伟大卫国战争时期的党史，研究得还很不够。历史学家在写这方面的题材时经常重复充满了个人崇拜的“斯大林传略”中的话，或者不加批判地袭用斯大林“论苏联伟大卫国战争”一书的原理，而这本书里的许多原理都是要重新加以审查的。例如，在我们的报刊上已经指出，把伟大卫国战争初期认做积极防御时期是错误的，并指出，必须实事求是地说明战争的历史，不容许抹杀1941到1942年苏联军队的错误、困难和失败。
    在许多著作中，主要是说明了战争活动的过程，而对于党组织的活动、后方的工作、游击队的斗争、党和苏维埃政府的对外政策和其他重要问题很少注意，竟至于不能容忍的地步。在我们的著作中把苏联打败希特勒德国这一历史性的胜利，完全归功于斯大林的领导。对于我国胜利原因的这种主观主义的解释是极不正确的。事实上，胜利是党和全体人民、光荣的苏维埃军队争得的，这些军队的领导者是党和人民选拔出来的天才的指挥员。
    应当极为确切和全面地说明苏联共产党在战后年代的活动，指出群众劳动热情的高涨；他们在党组织领导下克服了许多困难，在极短的时间内恢复并向前推进了我国的国民经济。指出这些，是很重要的。但同时也应指出苏共中央所揭发的，在战后年代里党和国家的领导所犯的严重错误（个人崇拜的盛行，党内民主、苏维埃民主以及社会主义法制的遭到破坏，在贯彻执行列宁的民族政策中所犯的错误，许多工业部门技术发展的落后，农业的无人照管等等）。中央委员会所采取的措施和二十次党代表大会的决定正是为了纠正这些缺点的。
    必须研究各个地方党组织的历史。直到现在还没有叙述莫斯科、列宁格勒和乌克兰这样大的党组织的历史的著作。特别重要的是正确地阐明南高加索布尔什维克的历史；应该揭穿已出版的著作中所存在的捏造和曲解。应当看到，不积累和概括地方党组织的历史材料，就不能写出科学性的党史。
    党的历史是全民历史的一个部分。党的一切活动、政策和策略都是被客观历史进程、国内和国际的形势所决定的。正是因为这样，所以要正确地研究党史，就必须深入了解我国和其他国家的经济和政治的历史。这样我们就有可能顺利地解决党史上的许多问题，特别是党史的分期问题。“联共（布）党史简明教程”的分期方法已经遭到反对，其中有许多地方需要重新审查。
    通晓列宁的伟大思想遗产，对于真正用马克思主义说明党史具有决定的意义。不能说在党史的著作中没有提到列宁的言论。不是的，列宁著作中的话是引用得很不少的。糟糕的是，常常是公式主义和教条主义的引用。党史学家很少研究科学社会主义创始人马克思和恩格斯的著作。纳·康·克鲁普斯卡娅在自己的回忆录中说，列宁经常“向马克思请教”。党史学家必须经常“请教”马克思、恩格斯和列宁，深入研究他们的思想，遵循他们的方法。
    党的第二十次代表大会正确指出，对于列宁遗著的运用受到过阻碍。许多在前几版“列宁全集”和“列宁文集”中刊印过的著作没有编入“列宁全集”第四版。第四版的参考资料很少，注释也非常简略。将近一千种列宁的著作和文件被刊印成几百种单行本，实际上，科学工作者和高等学校的教师很难得到。这种情形是不能容忍的。早就该出版列宁著作的完全集子了。
    论述列宁生平的著作的情况也是不能使我们满意的，不久以前发行的“列宁传略”第二版，是用干燥无味和缺乏热情的语言写成的。该书中的许多原理是从“联共（布）党史简明教程”中抽出来的。在这本书里还没有克服对斯大林的个人崇拜。应当尽快地写出全体劳动人民的这位伟大领袖和导师的出色的和正确的传记。早就需要有大部头的科学的列宁的传记，并且需要认真研究他在党史的不同发展时期的活动。
    研究苏联共产党的历史就不能不细心地研究党的文献。可惜我们的历史学家却很少注意这种史料。许多党代表大会和代表会议的速记报告和记录文件已成了珍本。1953年出版的“苏共中央决议汇编”是有缺点的，刊载在这上面的关于各次代表大会和代表会议的说明都是在重复“联共（布）党史简明教程”，对于读者了解代表大会和代表会议的环境和决议，帮助很少。
    要真正科学地研究党史，就必须深刻地研究报刊、档案材料和统计资料等等。但直到现在为止许多重要材料还没有向研究者发行，而且没有充分的理由就把一些文献保密起来。现在已经为利用档案工作创立了良好的条件，历史学家应该充分利用这些条件。苏共中央马克思列宁主义研究院（即过去的马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林研究院）负有大量出版党史文献汇编和专门著作的使命。
    老的布尔什维克和革命运动参加者的回忆录是有价值的史料。遗憾的是，在我们这里，搜集和出版回忆录，特别是苏维埃时期的回忆录的工作做得很差。党史研究院存在时曾经在这一方面展开了有益的工作，但是这项工作没有得到继续和进一步的发展。必须恢复出版回忆录的工作，并且再版那些已经成为珍本的回忆录。
    有一个指导党史科学发展的中心，对于党史的科学研究具有重要的意义。苏共中央马克思列宁主义研究院和它在各地的分院应当成为这样的中心。各大学、各高等学校的苏联共产党党史教研室和马克思列宁主义基础教研室正在进行一些科学研究工作，但是苏联高等教育部并没有认真地领导这项工作。
                          ★
    研究和宣传伟大列宁所创立的党的历史，是责任重大而又光荣的事业。我们这里有很多有能力的研究者和教师。他们都以对党高度负责的精神来解决新的任务。重要的是要帮助党史工作者彻底克服个人崇拜、书呆子习气和教条主义，并且把自己的全部工作建立在创造性的马克思列宁主义的基础上。
    我们的杂志在这方面应起很大的作用。“历史问题”杂志直到现在还很少注意研究党的历史，而刊载在杂志上的有关这类题材的论文，还包含着我国党史著作所犯的共同错误和缺点。我们认为，我们的任务是在杂志上刊登有关党史上极重要而又很少研究过的问题的论文，并对已出版的关于党史的著作的错误和缺点进行分析，开展认真的、实事求是的、真诚的批评和自我批评。这对正确的评价过去和拟定积极的实际工作纲领是有帮助的。同时，重新出版关于党史问题的专门杂志早就要求得很迫切了。
    苏联的历史学家正在根据苏联共产党二十次代表大会的历史性决定的精神改造自己的工作。这个改造并不等于从一个极端跳到另一个极端，克服对个别人物的崇拜并不等于去掉引文和抹去姓名。问题在于确切地用马克思主义说明历史的进程和个别人物的作用。
    党史学家工作的改造，应该是深入的，有组织的和深思熟虑的，决不能当做是一种仓卒的运动。许多具体的历史问题不能一下子解决。决不能依靠我们干部已习惯了的那种“万应灵药”式的指令或“指示性的”文章、来解决这些问题。正确地解决这些迫切的问题，首先要靠历史学家们的集体努力、自由交换意见、创造性的争论和认真的科学研究。应当更加勇敢地用新的方式开始工作，消除在科学创造的道路上的一切障碍。
    党的第二十次代表大会明确地规定了我们的任务。必须消灭书呆子习气和教条主义，认真地遵循列宁的学说和列宁的方法，创作充满新颖思想，充满创作热诚和好学不倦的研究精神的科学著作，并用它们来促进共产主义的胜利。
