    Mothers' Voices
    We are a group of female workers with children from the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant. The leaders of the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant are not concerned enough about the special difficulties of us female workers.
    The Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant has more than 400 female employees, most of whom are married with children. Among the more than 40 female employees in the laboratory, 24 have children, with a total of 55 children under the age of five. The hospital has more than 100 female employees, with 78 having children. Some female workers are raising three, four, or even five or six children.
    Our factory and dormitories are very far apart. Some female workers have to spend two or three hours commuting to and from work every day. When they get home, they have to take care of their children, cook, and do laundry, which is really exhausting. Some female workers lock their small children in the house while they are at work, which has resulted in children falling off the "kang" (traditional Chinese platform bed). Chen Baozhen, a female staff member of the hospital, has five children. When she is at work, she leaves her six-year-old child to look after the four-year-old and one-year-old children. Before going to work, she prepares a day's worth of food for the children to eat. She has to go straight home after work and cannot attend any meetings, study sessions, or social activities. This situation has made it impossible for some female workers to concentrate on their work, guarantee their studies, and their health has also been affected.
    The leaders of the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant, especially the Women Workers' Department of the Trade Union, are well aware of these problems. However, they have always regarded this as a problem for a small number of people and have not actively sought solutions. In 1954, after repeated requests from the female workers, the factory finally established a nursing room; however, it only accepts children under the age of one, and they must be sent in during the day and picked up in the evening. The problem of children of female workers on the night shift has not been solved. As for the establishment of a nursery, it has been proposed at every employee representative meeting since 1951, but it has not been resolved for more than six years. Even now, the factory trade union's future work plan does not mention the establishment of a nursery at all. Is it because the trade union doesn't have the money? No! Many female workers have even offered to pay themselves so that the trade union can organize it. However, the trade union's response is "We'll study it and talk about it later" and "It's coming soon, it's coming soon," and then no one talks about it anymore.
    At present, the general mentality of female workers in our factory is: unmarried women are afraid of getting married, married women are afraid of having children, and those with children have unspeakable suffering. Isn't this situation serious enough? However, the leaders of our factory turn a blind eye to it.

    妈妈们的呼声
    我们是太原钢铁厂一群有孩子的女工。太原钢铁厂的领导人员对我们女工的特殊困难太不关心了。
    太原钢铁厂现有女职工四百多名，大部分结了婚，有了孩子。试验室四十多个女职工中，有小孩的二十四人，共有五岁以下的孩子五十五个。医院女职工一百多人，有小孩的七十八人。有些女工养育着三、四个甚至五、六个孩子。
    我们的工厂和宿舍相距很远，有些女工每天上下班就要走两三个钟点，回家还得照料孩子、做饭、洗家具，实在劳累不堪。有的女工在上班的时候就把小的孩子锁在屋里，因而曾经发生孩子从炕上摔下来的事情。医院女工作人员陈宝珍有五个小孩，她在上班的时候就让六岁的小孩看四岁和一岁的孩子，在上班前先做好一天的饭留给孩子们吃，下班后马上就得回家，任何会议、学习和社会活动都不能参加。这种情况已经使一部分女工不能安心工作，不能保证学习，身体健康也受到损害。
    这些问题，太原钢铁厂领导人员，特别是工会女工部，知道得十分清楚。但是，他们一直认为这是少数人的问题，不积极设法解决。1954年，在女工们的再三要求下，厂里总算成立了哺乳室；但是只收一周岁以下的小孩，而且必须白天送进去，晚上领回来。夜班女工的孩子问题还是得不到解决。至于成立托儿所的问题，从1951年以来的每次职工代表会上都提出过，但是六年多来一直没有解决。直到现在，厂工会制定的今后工作规划中也根本没有提到办托儿所的问题。是工会没有钱吗？不是！不少女工甚至提出愿意自己出钱，由工会筹办。但是工会的答复却是“研究一下，以后再说”和“快了快了”，以后这件事也就没人再谈了。
    目前，我们厂里女工的普遍心理是：没有结婚的怕结婚，结了婚的怕生孩子，有了小孩的心里有苦说不出。这种情况难道还不严重吗？但是，我们厂的领导人员却视若无睹。
