We Must Not Allow Exploitation to Resurrect
Hui Zhi

Exploitative practices like "interest on interest" and "rolling like a donkey" had all but disappeared from the countryside after agricultural collectivization. However, recently, new tricks have emerged in some agricultural production cooperatives: some farmers with surplus money are taking advantage of the lean season and the financial difficulties of some members to buy up their labor work points. In the Liming Agricultural Cooperative, Eleventh Team, in Zhubei Temple Township, Huanggang County, Hubei Province, nine households with surplus money bought more than 320 labor work points from eleven poor and lower-middle peasant households. In the Lizhuang Agricultural Cooperative, Zhenxi Township, Wuxing County, Zhejiang Province, upper-middle peasant Li Faqing and other households bought more than 100 work points from poor peasants Jin Xingbao and three other households. They are currently paying only seven to ten cents in cash for one work point, but in the autumn, they can expect to receive about twenty cents; the interest is doubled. Pan Xingji, a member of the Second Cooperative in Fengjiawei Township, Qujing County, Yunnan Province, used cigarettes and matches to exchange for other people's work points. A pack of cigarettes and a box of matches worth fifteen cents were exchanged for five labor work points. Based on the cooperative's production situation, these five work points are estimated to be worth at least one yuan after the autumn distribution. Getting several times the profit in a few months, isn't this a new form of "rolling like a donkey"?

There are many reasons for the occurrence of this phenomenon, the most important of which is that some local and some agricultural cooperative cadres only pay attention to production and construction and do not pay much attention to the lives and thoughts of the members; some agricultural cooperatives have very little sideline income, and the cooperative deducts too much, so that members do not even have money to buy oil, salt, and matches; some credit cooperatives only focus on production loans and do not pay attention to living loans, and even dislike poor households and are unwilling to lend to them. As a result, some poor members have no choice but to sell their work points to maintain their lives; people with surplus money and poor political awareness take the opportunity to buy up work points and make huge profits.

What is particularly worth mentioning is that some rural backbone elements not only do not care about the hardships of poor households, and do not educate those with surplus money to invest in the cooperative or deposit their surplus money in banks and credit cooperatives, but instead take the lead in buying up the work points of the members. The Li Faqing mentioned above is both the township head and a member of the Communist Youth League, and he bought more than twenty work points at once; among the people who bought work points in Huanggang County, one was the deputy director of the cooperative and two were management committee members. These people certainly know that agricultural collectivization is to eliminate the system of exploitation and lead the broad masses of farmers to the road of common prosperity. However, they have developed exploitative behavior within the cooperative. If this behavior is allowed to continue, polarization will occur within the cooperative, and the cooperative will be in danger of changing its nature and collapsing.

How should we deal with this problem? After discovering this problem, the Huanggang County Committee of the Communist Party of China notified the district committee: universally educate cadres and members to make them aware of the seriousness of the problem, and require cadres at the district, township, and cooperative levels to care about the lives of poor members, give them priority loans, develop diversified operations, and strive to increase income to prevent the same thing from continuing to happen.

The Huanggang County Committee's approach is correct and very necessary. However, some people think that this is an accidental occurrence during the spring famine, and now that the summer harvest distribution has been carried out, the problem has been solved. This idea is wrong. Among the members of the Liming Agricultural Cooperative, Eleventh Team, who sold their work points, six households sold their work points because they did not have enough food after the summer harvest distribution. After the summer harvest, the problems of households in difficulty may not be completely resolved. In areas affected by disasters and reduced production, the number of households in difficulty may even increase. Areas with no summer harvest or few summer harvest crops are still in the lean season. Therefore, caring about the lives of the members, helping households in difficulty solve their problems, and preventing the continued occurrence of the phenomenon of buying and selling work points is still an important issue that cannot be ignored.

All exploitative behavior is incompatible with our socialist cause. In order to build a new countryside, we must never allow it to resurrect in any new form!

    不能让剥削行为借尸还魂
    慧之
    “转风钱”“驴打滚”之类的剥削花样，在农业合作化以后的农村中，可以说是已经消踪匿迹了。但是，最近在某些农业生产合作社里却又出现了新的花样：有些有余钱的农民，趁着青黄不接、某些社员生活发生困难的时候，收买他们的劳动工分。湖北黄冈县竹陂寺乡黎明农业社第十一社，九户有余钱的社员买进十一户贫农和下中农社员三百二十多个劳动工分。浙江吴兴县镇西乡李庄农业社上中农李发清等户，买了贫农金杏宝等四户一百多个工分。他们现在买一个工分只拿出七分到一角左右的现款，秋后就可以分到二角左右；利息是加倍的。云南曲靖县冯家圩乡第二社社员潘兴基，用香烟火柴之类的东西换别人的工分，价值一角五分钱的一包香烟和一盒火柴，换五个劳动工分，根据社里生产情况估计，这五个工分到秋后至少要分到一元多。几个月的时间拿到几倍的利钱，这不是新的“驴打滚”是什么？
    发生这种现象的原因是多方面的，最主要的是有些地方和有些农业合作社的干部，只注意生产建设，对于社员生活和思想情况不大过问；有些农业社副业收入很少，社里扣得又很紧，社员连买油、盐、火柴的钱都没有；某些信用合作社只重视生产贷款，不注意生活贷款，甚至嫌贫困户穷而不愿意贷款给他们。这样一来，有些贫困社员就不得不依靠出卖工分来维持生活；有余钱而政治觉悟很差的人，便乘机收买工分，牟取暴利。
    特别值得提出的是：有一些农村的骨干分子，不仅不关心贫困户的生活疾苦，不教育有余钱的人向社内投资或把余钱存入银行、信用社，反而带头收买社员的工分。上面所说的李发清，既是乡长，又是青年团员，他一下就买了二十多个工分；黄冈县买工分的人当中，有一个是社的副主任，两个是管理委员。这些人当然知道农业合作化就是为了消灭剥削制度，使广大农民走上共同富裕的道路。但是，他们却在社内发展起剥削行为来了。如果听任这种行为发展下去，合作社内就会出现两极分化现象，合作社就有变质和垮台的危险。
    怎样对待这个问题呢？中共黄冈县委发现这个问题后，就通知区委：普遍教育干部、社员，使他们认识这个问题的严重性，要求区、乡、社干部关心贫苦社员的生活，给以优先贷款，开展多种经营，力求增加收入，防止同样的事情继续发生。
    黄冈县委的做法是对的，很必要的。可是，有些人认为这是春荒中偶然发生的事情，现在已经进行了夏收分配，问题已经解决了。这种想法是不对的。黎明农业社第十一社卖工分的社员中，就有六户是在夏收分配以后，因口粮不够而出卖工分的。夏收以后，困难户的问题不一定能够完全解决。遭灾减产的地方，困难户还可能加多。没有夏收或夏收作物很少的地方，还处在青黄不接的阶段。因此，关心社员生活，帮助困难户解决问题，防止买卖工分现象的继续发生，仍然是一个不能忽视的重要问题。
    一切剥削行为都是和我们的社会主义事业不相容的。为了建设新农村，决不能容许它以任何新的面目借尸还魂！
