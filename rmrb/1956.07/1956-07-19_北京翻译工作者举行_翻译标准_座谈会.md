    Beijing Translators Hold Symposium on "Translation Standards"
    (Our newspaper dispatch) A symposium on issues such as "translation standards" was held on July 5th at the Compilation and Translation Bureau of the Works of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. More than 60 representatives from 22 units, including the Compilation and Publication Committee of the Academy of Sciences, the Institute of Philosophy of the Academy of Sciences, and the Xinhua News Agency, attended the symposium.
    At the symposium, after Comrade Shi Zhe explained the purpose of the meeting, He Kuang, Li Guojun, Guan Pinshu, He Lin, and others spoke. The comrades present believed that there was inconsistency in the understanding of translation standards among translators, and therefore it was necessary to have a full discussion on this issue.
    At the meeting, some comrades put forward their own views on translation standards. For example, some comrades believed that translation standards should include two aspects: accurately grasping the content and form of the original text; strictly abiding by the laws of the mother tongue. Some comrades also believed that, in addition to these two aspects, comrades engaged in translating Chinese into foreign languages should also pay attention to other factors, such as using appropriate words to avoid misunderstandings of the translation by foreign readers.
    The comrades attending the meeting also believed that translation work must be combined with scientific research work. In this way, not only can the quality of translations of scientific works be improved, but also a group of scientific research talents can be cultivated. Some comrades also talked about translators continuously improving their Chinese proficiency so that the translation meets Chinese norms, etc.
    In addition, many comrades proposed that different translations should be allowed to exist, and that "one-bookism" and the idea of worshipping authority should be opposed.
    Finally, everyone believed that if translation work is to be done well, translators should have their own organizations and publications for researching and guiding translation work.

    北京翻译工作者举行“翻译标准”座谈会
    本报讯　七月五日在中共中央马克思，恩格斯、列宁、斯大林著作编译局举行了有关“翻译标准”等问题的座谈会。参加座谈会的有科学院编译出版委员会、科学院哲学研究所、新华社等二十二个单位的代表共六十余人。
    座谈会上在师哲同志说明这次会议的目的后，有何匡、李国钧、关品枢、贺麟等人发言。到会的同志认为，目前翻译工作者对翻译标准的理解不一致，因此有必要就这个问题展开充分讨论。
    会上，有些同志对翻译标准提出了自己的见解。例如，有的同志认为翻译标准应包含两个内容：正确掌握原文内容和形式；严格遵守祖国语言的规律。也有的同志认为，除了这两个内容外，从事中文译外文的同志还要注意到其他因素，如用词恰当，以免国外读者对译文产生误解。
    出席会议的同志还认为翻译工作必须同科学研究工作结合起来。这样，不仅可以提高科学著作译文的质量，而且还能培养出一批科学研究人才。还有同志谈到翻译工作者要不断地提高自己的中文水平，使译文符合汉语规范等。
    此外，许多同志提出，应当允许各种不同的译本存在，应当反对“一本书主义”和崇拜权威的思想。
    最后，大家认为，如要搞好翻译工作，翻译工作者就要有自己的组织以及研究和指导翻译工作的刊物。　　　　　　　于沪生
