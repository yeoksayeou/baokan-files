Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, 2nd—On the occasion of the 35th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China on July 1st, the Dalai Lama and Panchen Erdeni of Tibet sent telegrams of respect to Chairman Mao Zedong. They first extended their highest respects and sincere congratulations to Chairman Mao and all members of the CPC Central Committee on behalf of all the clergy and lay officials and people of Tibet.

In his telegram, the Dalai Lama said: The Communist Party of China is a political party that represents the interests of the people of all ethnic groups in the country. From its birth, it has resolutely implemented the policy of equality among nationalities and the policy of freedom of religious belief. After liberation, it adopted the policy of "peaceful reform" based on the historical development characteristics of various minority areas, and led the people of all minority nationalities to actively develop production, so that minority nationalities could change the backward political, economic, and cultural conditions left over from history and gradually transition to a happy socialist society. Now, Tibet, like all fraternal ethnic groups in the country, has, since its peaceful liberation, while earnestly implementing the Party's ethnic policies and the policy of freedom of religious belief, achieved many important achievements in developing Tibet's economic and cultural construction, which has brought many benefits to the people of Tibet. He stated: In the future, he will certainly unite with Panchen Erdeni and all clergy and lay officials and people in the region, follow Chairman Mao's instructions of "unity, progress, and greater development," strive to implement the State Council's decision to establish the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region, strive for the early establishment of a unified Tibet Autonomous Region, and actively focus on trial reforms and create conditions for reform, and strive to enable the Tibet region to transition to socialism together with all ethnic groups in the country.

In his telegram, Panchen Erdeni said: "We wholeheartedly support the principle of 'unity, progress, and greater development' that you have indicated. I will certainly be closely with the Dalai Lama, unite the people of all strata in Tibet, and under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, victoriously implement the glorious resolutions of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region, and strive for the early realization of regional autonomy for the unified Tibetan nationality."

    达赖喇嘛和班禅额尔德尼致电毛主席祝贺“七一”
    新华社拉萨2日电　西藏达赖喇嘛和班禅额尔德尼在七月一日中国共产党成立三十五周年纪念日，分别给毛泽东主席发出致敬电。他们首先代表西藏全体僧俗官员和人民向毛主席和中共中央全体委员们致以崇高的敬意和衷诚祝贺。
    达赖喇嘛在电文中说：中国共产党是代表全国各民族人民利益的政党，它从诞生之日起就坚决实行民族平等政策和宗教信仰自由政策，解放后又根据各少数民族地区历史发展的特点，采取“和平改革”政策，领导各少数民族人民积极发展生产，使少数民族改变历史上遗留下来的政治、经济、文化方面的落后状态，而能逐步过渡到幸福的社会主义社会。现在，西藏也同全国各兄弟民族一样，自和平解放以来，与认真执行党的民族政策和宗教信仰自由政策的同时，在发展西藏的经济、文化建设事业方面取得了许多重要的成就，使西藏人民得到了许多好处。他表示：今后一定同班禅额尔德尼和全区僧俗官员及人民团结一致，遵照毛主席“团结、进步、更加发展”的指示，努力执行国务院关于成立西藏自治区筹备委员会的决定，争取早日成立统一的西藏自治区，并积极地重点试办改革，和创造改革的条件，为使西藏地区能和全国各民族一起过渡到社会主义而努力。
    班禅额尔德尼在电文中说：“我们衷心拥护您所指示的‘团结、进步、更加发展’的方针，我一定和达赖喇嘛亲密地在一起，团结西藏各阶层人民，在中国共产党的领导下，胜利地执行西藏自治区筹备委员会的光荣决议，并为早日实现统一的西藏民族的区域自治而努力。”
