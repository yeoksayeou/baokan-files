Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, July 30th: Egypt announced yesterday that it would refuse to accept British bank checks for the payment of fees for passage through the Suez Canal.

British ships, which account for approximately one-third of all traffic through the canal, must now pay in cash or with checks from other countries.

Saeed, an official with the Suez Canal Authority, said that this action was taken because Britain had frozen Egyptian bank deposits there.

The purpose of this action by the Canal Authority is to prevent taxes from being frozen by British banks. Egypt announced that it will guarantee freedom of navigation in the canal. Saeed also said that the Canal Authority will accept cash in British pounds or pound checks from banks outside of Britain.

Since Egypt took over the canal, traffic through the canal has not been interrupted.

    对支付通过运河的税款
    埃及拒收英国银行支票
    据新华社30日讯　开罗消息：埃及昨天宣布将拒绝接受用英国银行支票支付的通过苏彝士运河的税款。
    占运河全部往来船只大约三分之一的英国船现在必须付现金或者其他国家的支票。
    苏彝士运河主管当局的官员赛义德说，采取这个行动是因为英国冻结了埃及在那里的银行存款。
    运河当局采取这个行动的目的是提防税款被英国银行冻结。埃及宣布将保障运河航行自由赛义德又说，运河当局将接受英镑现金或者在英国以外的银行的英镑支票。
    在埃及接管运河以后，运河内的船只往来一直没有中断。
