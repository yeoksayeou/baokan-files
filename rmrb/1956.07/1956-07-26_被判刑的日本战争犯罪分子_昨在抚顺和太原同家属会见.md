Xinhua News Agency, July 25th – With the permission of the Chinese government, convicted Japanese war criminals met with their families in Fushun and Taiyuan today.

　　鵜野好, the mother of Japanese war criminal Uno Shintaro, who was sentenced to thirteen years in prison, said to her son at the Fushun War Criminals Management Center today: "I know you have done many bad things to the Chinese people. I hope you will better confess your crimes in the future to repay the kindness of the Chinese people."

　　A total of nine family members of Japanese war criminals came to Fushun from Tianjin with Uno Yoshimi. Another nine family members of Japanese war criminals arrived in Taiyuan today. They have all met with the convicted Japanese war criminals.

　　Former Japanese Lieutenant General and Division Commander Suzuki Keikyu, who was sentenced to twenty years in prison, told Japanese reporters after meeting his family: "Before today, I knew my wife was coming to see me. I really don't know how to thank the Chinese people for this humanitarian treatment." Suzuki Keikyu's wife, who was sitting beside him, said, "Before I came to China, I had many doubts and fears, but after I came to China, I was taken care of by the Chinese Red Cross. When I saw that my husband was much healthier than I had imagined, I was completely relieved."

　　After meeting his family, former Japanese Lieutenant General and Division Commander Fujita Shigeru, who was sentenced to eighteen years in prison, was asked by a reporter from the Japanese "Yomiuri Shimbun" about his views on the current Japanese Self-Defense Forces. Fujita Shigeru said: "Any country should have its own self-defense forces. If the current Japanese Self-Defense Forces are for the purpose of defending the motherland, I am very much in favor of it. But if it is still to become cannon fodder for wars of aggression, I resolutely oppose it."

　　In the Taiyuan War Criminals Management Center, Tominaga Juntaro, who was sentenced to twenty years in prison, met his wife and nine-year-old daughter. Tominaga Juntaro asked his wife, Tominaga Kimiko, "Is China now different from what you imagined?" Tominaga Kimiko said, "This matter of allowing us to come to China is enough to see the difference." She also told her husband that she was very grateful that the family of a war criminal received such treatment.

　　These family members of Japanese war criminals, accompanied by representatives of the Chinese Red Cross, took trains from Tianjin to Taiyuan and Fushun on the 24th. In addition, nine Japanese reporters also arrived in Taiyuan and Fushun, respectively.

    被判处十三年徒刑的日本战争犯罪分子鹈野晋太郎的母亲鹈野好今天在抚顺战犯管理所会见她儿子时说：“我知道你对中国人民做了许多坏事，我希望你今后要更好地认罪，以报答中国人民的恩情。
    同鹈野好一起从天津到抚顺的共有九名日本战争犯罪分子的家属。今天还有另外九名日本战争犯罪分子的家属到达了太原。他们都已经同被判刑的日本战争犯罪分子见了面。

    被判处十八年徒刑的前日本陆军中将师团长藤田茂在会见自己的家属以后，日本“读卖新闻”记者问他对目前的日本自卫队的看法，藤田茂说：“任何一个国家都应该有自己的自卫军队，如果目前日本的自卫队是为了保卫祖国，我很赞成。但如果它仍将成为侵略战争的炮灰，我就坚决反对。”
    在太原战犯管理所里，被判处二十年徒刑的富永顺太郎会见了他的妻子和九岁的女儿。富永顺太郎问他的妻子富永贵美子说：“现在的中国和你想像的中国不一样吧！”富永贵美子说：“只要从让我们来中国这件事上就可以完全看出来。”她还告诉她的丈夫说，没有想到一个战争犯罪分子的家属受到这样的招待，真是感激。
    这些日本战争犯罪分子的家属，是在中国红十字会代表陪同下，在二十四日从天津乘火车分别到太原和抚顺的。另外，还有九名日本记者随同分别到达太原和抚顺。
