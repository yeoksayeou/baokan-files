Xinhua News Agency dispatch:

The construction projects to change the face of Fushun, the coal capital, have all started by the beginning of July. A large amount of coal in Fushun is buried under some of the existing residential areas. In order to extract this coal, people living on top of the coal seams will be gradually relocated to new residential areas starting this year.

More than 300,000 square meters of new housing has been started this year in the three scenic areas of Dongzhou River in the eastern suburbs of Fushun, the north bank of Yanhe River in the northern suburbs, and Wanghua in the western suburbs. By the end of June, more than 50,000 square meters had been completed. Three of the twenty-eight roads being built in the new residential areas have been completed.

According to Fushun's twelve-year plan, the current unreasonable situation where residential areas are mixed with industrial and mining areas will be changed. The three new residential areas under construction this year will be the main urban areas of Fushun in the future. In each residential area, schools, hospitals, cinemas, libraries, stadiums, swimming pools, parks, etc. will be established. Several large bridges will be built across the Yanhe and Dongzhou Rivers to carry cars and trams, connecting the urban area and the industrial area.

    改变煤都面貌
    据新华社讯　改变煤都——抚顺城市面貌的建筑工程，到七月初已经全部动工。抚顺市有大量的煤被压在市内现有的一部分住宅区下面，为了能把这些煤开采出来，从今年起，居住在煤层上面的人们就要陆续迁移到新的住宅区去。
    在抚顺市东郊东洲河畔、北郊淹河北岸和西郊望花三个风景优美的地区，今年开工新建的三十多万平方公尺的住宅，到六月底已经有五万多平方公尺落成。在新住宅区建设的二十八条公路，已经建成三条。
    按照抚顺市十二年规划，这个城市目前居住区混和在工矿区之间的不合理状况将要改变。今年动工兴建的三个新住宅区，将来是抚顺市的主要市区。在每个住宅区里，都将设立学校、医院、影院、图书馆、体育场和游泳池、公园等。在淹河和东洲河的河面上，将架起几座大桥，通行汽车、电车，把市区和工业区联接起来。
