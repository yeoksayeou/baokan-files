Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 15th July: The United Front Work Department of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, based on the spirit of the speech made by Li Weihan, Minister of the United Front Work Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, at the Third Session of the First National People's Congress regarding the work of the united front, separately invited the heads of the municipal-level organizations of various democratic parties in Shanghai to hold six symposiums. The meetings were to discuss the policy of "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision between the Communist Party and the various democratic parties" and to solicit their opinions on the work of the united front work departments at all levels.

The heads of the local organizations of various democratic parties who attended the meeting were very excited about the policy of "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision" put forward by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. Everyone requested the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China to strengthen specific leadership over the work of the democratic parties, and suggested that this policy be widely publicized to Party and non-Party cadres throughout the city, so that the work of the various democratic parties in all aspects could receive more support and assistance. During the symposium, everyone put forward many criticisms and suggestions on the work of the Municipal Committee's United Front Work Department, pointing out that the Municipal Committee's United Front Work Department had not provided enough assistance to the work of the democratic parties in the past, and that it had been "more caring and less critical" in terms of daily life. Everyone suggested that such symposiums be held every three months or so in the future, to exchange work experience and improve each other in a heart-to-heart manner. At the same time, it was suggested that newspapers should publish more information about the activities and work experience of the democratic parties in the future. Now that various democratic parties have established district-level organizations, it is hoped that the district committees of the Communist Party of China will give more support and assistance.

The symposium also discussed the work of political consultation, criticizing the shortcomings of the current Shanghai CPPCC work as "having top but no bottom" (referring to the fact that situations are reported upwards, but often there is no follow-up) and "when work is done, it is connected upwards but not downwards" (referring to the fact that grassroots areas do not pay enough attention to consultation work). Some groups under the CPPCC also rarely meet. In addition, many comrades pointed out that some grassroots organizations do not care enough about and attach enough importance to the work of the democratic parties, and that the original joint conference of parties in some universities is no longer held. It is hoped that this liaison system can be restored.

These six symposiums were held from June 27th to July 3rd. The Shanghai local organizations of various democratic parties are now holding relevant meetings to further deepen the discussion.

Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 15th July: Twenty-two people, including heads and representatives of the local organizations of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, the China Democratic League, the China National Democratic Construction Association, the China Association for Promoting Democracy, and the Jiusan Society in Tianjin, attended a symposium convened by the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference yesterday, and discussed the policy of long-term coexistence and mutual supervision between the Communist Party of China and the various democratic parties.

Those who spoke at the symposium unanimously supported the policy put forward by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. Some people believe that this policy shows that the prospects of the democratic parties and the prospects of socialism are consistent, and it adds new content to the work of the united front. Some believe that "contacting the masses and demanding supervision are the characteristics of the Communist Party." In order to better achieve long-term coexistence and mutual supervision, some people suggested that under the guidance of this policy, comrade-like ties should be established between the democratic parties and between the democratic parties and the Communist Party.

In order to better strengthen unity, many people at the meeting put forward well-intentioned criticisms of the Communist Party's united front work. Some criticized the phenomenon that some Communist Party members are afraid of "being infected with non-working-class ideology" and therefore are afraid of contacting members of democratic parties. It was proposed at the meeting that Communist Party members should integrate with the masses, and that there should be no "host-guest distinction" between the democratic parties and the Communist Party. Zhu Jisheng, Deputy Chairman of the Tianjin Branch of the China National Democratic Construction Association, criticized the phenomenon that some Communist Party members do not have enough understanding of the role of the democratic parties and do not attach enough importance to the members of the democratic parties. He believes that this situation should be improved in order to better exert the role of the democratic parties. Pan Chengxiao, Deputy Director of the Tianjin Branch of the China Association for Promoting Democracy, criticized the United Front Work Department for being too polite to the democratic parties. He said that "politeness" means "being distant," and he suggested that they should be open and candid and carry out criticism. Many people in their speeches criticized the democratic parties for their past dependence on others in their work, lacking independent thinking. They believe that if this situation is not changed, they cannot play a role in mutual supervision. They said that now that the policy of long-term coexistence and mutual supervision is clear, the main problem in the future is that the democratic parties must do their work well, otherwise, even if they "coexist for a long time," it will be "nominal."

    上海天津各民主党派负责人举行座谈
    讨论长期共存互相监督的方针
    对共产党的统一战线工作提出很多批评和建议
    本报上海15日电　中共上海市委统战部根据中共中央统战部部长李维汉在第一届全国人民代表大会第三次会议上对统一战线工作的意见的发言的精神，分别邀请上海市各民主党派市级机关负责人举行了六个座谈会，讨论“共产党和各民主党派长期共同存在，互相监督”的方针，并征求他们对各级统一战线工作部门的意见。
    与会的各民主党派地方组织负责人对中共中央提出的“长期共存，互相监督”的方针感到非常兴奋，大家要求中共市委加强对民主党派工作的具体领导，并建议向全市党和非党干部广泛宣传这个方针，使各民主党派各方面的工作能得到更多的支持和帮助。在座谈会中，大家对市委统战部的工作提出了许多批评和建议。指出市委统战部过去对民主党派的工作帮助不够；在生活上是“照顾多、批评少”。大家建议今后每三个月或相当时期能召开一次这样的座谈会，以谈心的方式彼此交流工作经验，相互提高。同时，建议各个报纸今后多刊登民主党派的活动情况和工作经验。目前各个民主党派已建立了区级组织，希望中共区委给予更多的支持和协助。
    座谈会还谈了政治协商工作，批评目前上海政协工作的缺点是“有上无下”（指情况反映上去，多无下文）“做起工作来，上通下不通”（指基层对协商工作重视不够），政协所属某些小组也很少开会。此外，不少同志指出某些基层组织对民主党派工作关怀和重视不够，有的大学原有的党派联席会议现在也不开了，希望能够恢复这个联系制度。
    这六个座谈会是六月二十七日至七月三日分别举行的，各民主党派上海地方组织现在正分别召开有关会议，深入一步展开讨论。
    新华社天津15日电　中国国民党革命委员会、中国民主同盟、中国民主建国会、中国民主促进会和九三学社在天津的地方组织负责人和代表二十二人，昨天在政协天津市委员会召集的座谈会上，座谈了关于中国共产党同各民主党派长期共存、互相监督的方针。
    在座谈会上发言的人一致拥护中共中央提出的这一方针。有的人认为，这个方针说明了民主党派的远景和社会主义的远景是一致的，它给统一战线工作增加了新的内容。有的认为：“联系群众，要求监督，这是共产党的特征。”为了更好的长期共存和互相监督起见，有人提出应该在这个方针的指导下，建立民主党派之间和民主党派同共产党之间同志式的联系。
    为了更好地加强团结，许多人在会上对共产党的统一战线工作提出了善意的批评。有人批评有些共产党员怕“沾染上非工人阶级思想”，因而怕和民主党派成员接触的现象。会上提出，共产党员应该和群众打成一片，民主党派和共产党之间不应当有“主客之分”。中国民主建国会天津市分会副主任委员朱继圣批评有些共产党员对民主党派作用认识不够和对民主党派成员重视不够的现象，他认为这种情况应该加以改进，以便更好地发挥民主党派的作用。中国民主促进会天津市分会副主任理事潘承孝批评统一战线工作部门对民主党派很客气，他说“客气”就是“见外”，他提议应该开诚布公，开展批评。很多人在发言中批判民主党派过去在工作中束手束脚、缺乏独立思考的依赖思想，他们认为如果不改变这种情况，就不能起到互相监督的作用。他们说，现在长期共存互相监督的方针是明确了，今后主要的问题是民主党派要把工作作好，否则即使“长存”，也是“有名无实”。
