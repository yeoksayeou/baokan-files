Lessons That Cannot Be Ignored

    The People's Daily published a news item on July 23rd stating that the factory director and Party committee secretary, and other important leading personnel, of the state-owned Shenyang Transformer Factory, proceeding from base bourgeois individualism and forgetting their sacred responsibilities, engaged in long-term unprincipled disputes, seriously relaxed and even abandoned leadership and supervision of production and construction work, resulting in a large amount of loss, waste, and backlog of state assets, and serious damage to machinery and equipment. This is a lesson that cannot be ignored.
    Many facts prove that among our Communist Party members and revolutionary workers, on the one hand, there are many who regard the interests of the state and the people as paramount. They are constantly concerned about the quality of the work and the implementation of the Party and state's construction plans and policies and laws. They possess a noble communist moral character and are an important guarantee for the continuous development of our cause. On the other hand, there are also many people who severely lack communist consciousness and a sense of responsibility towards the people's cause. What they care about is not the cause of the Party and the people, but the level of their personal status and the size of their power. In this way, the Party and the state not only cannot organize and lead the broad masses through them to promote the development of the construction cause, but also cause significant losses to the interests of the state and the people due to their serious mistakes and dereliction of duty. The Shenyang Transformer Factory incident is just one example.
    The state-owned Shenyang Transformer Factory is the only factory in our country that produces transformers, and it is also a factory with investment exceeding the quota during the Five-Year Plan period. The quality of its production and construction work directly affects the country's socialist industrial construction. The state appointed Comrade Ren Junjie to serve as the factory director, and the Party organization selected Comrade Lang Zongying to serve as the Party committee secretary of the factory. Entrusting such an important factory to their leadership shows that the Party and the state have great trust in them. Logically, in the face of such a serious task, Comrades Ren Junjie and Lang Zongying should have cooperated closely in their work, leading and uniting the cadres and workers of the entire factory to jointly improve the production and work of the entire factory, so as not to fail the trust of the Party and the state in them. However, the facts were completely different. Ren and Lang engaged in unprincipled disputes for the sake of their personal power, completely disregarding the trust placed in them by the Party and the state. Both of them had a strong sense of individualism and complacency. One believed that since he was the factory director, he could refuse to accept the leadership and supervision of the Party. The other believed that since he was the Party committee secretary, had arrived at the factory the earliest, and the majority of the cadres in the factory were personally trained and promoted by him, then the power within the factory should be exclusively controlled by him. They constantly argued about their personal power, debating "who has the final say" and "who leads whom." They turned a blind eye to the shocking phenomena of production sabotage and machine damage within the factory, remaining indifferent. It is very clear that under the leadership of such a factory director and Party committee secretary, it is completely inconceivable for the Shenyang Transformer Factory to successfully complete all aspects of its targets, implement the state's policies and laws, and improve production and capital construction work.
    The political and economic losses caused by the disunity of the leading personnel of the Shenyang Transformer Factory are serious. All our enterprises, institutions, and other organizations need to learn from this incident.
    The most important lesson is that the Party and administrative leaders must always be vigilant against the bourgeois individualism in their minds. Whoever has this kind of thinking and does not pay attention to overcoming it for a long time, allowing it to develop, will inevitably make serious mistakes in their work. Under certain conditions, it may even develop to the point of betraying the Party and the people. This can be considered a law, which has been proven by countless facts. In the Shenyang Transformer Factory incident, it can be seen that when Ren Junjie, Lang Zongying, and others were preoccupied with their personal power and engaged in struggle, they committed serious bureaucratic errors and dereliction of duty in their work. Factory director Ren Junjie rarely went to the workshops, relying only on listening to reports, and therefore was unaware of many serious situations of machine damage. Many major problems in product quality were also not resolved for a long time, resulting in an abundance of substandard and waste products, and constant accidents. Party committee secretary Lang Zongying simply regarded the problems in production and work as capital to attack Ren Junjie, and did not come up with any positive ways to change the situation himself. Base bourgeois ideology and personal power desires even led them down the shameful path of deceiving the Party and the state. They concealed shortcomings, errors, and serious situations in their work from their superiors, falsely reported achievements, and stole honors and large amounts of bonuses. If it were not for this thorough exposure and handling, their mistakes would have developed to an unimaginable degree.
    Another important lesson is that the central competent departments and local Party organizations need to regularly send people to go deep into factories and mining enterprises to inspect the enterprise work and the implementation of state policies and laws, to discover and solve problems at any time, and never wait until a large number of problems have accumulated before conducting inspections and handling them. The reason why the problem of disunity among the leading personnel of the Shenyang Transformer Factory could not be resolved for a long time, but instead became more and more serious, is inseparable from the bureaucratic work style of the leaders of their superior leading organization—the former Electrical Industry Administration Bureau of the First Ministry of Machine Building. This bureau had discovered the problems of the Shenyang Transformer Factory long ago, but did not conduct serious inspections and handling for a long time. On the contrary, they blindly believed their false reports, introduced their false experiences, and issued large amounts of bonuses. This kind of blind leadership style is bound to go bankrupt sooner or later.
    A lesson should also be drawn from the Shenyang Transformer Factory incident, which is that the leadership of the local Party committee over factories and mining enterprises must be strengthened. The Shenyang Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China was not completely unaware of the errors of the leaders of the transformer factory; however, because the factory was directly under the leadership of the central competent department, they did not dare to be responsible for handling this incident, and did not promptly report it to their superiors, which led to the errors of the leading personnel of the factory developing even more seriously. The Shenyang Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China should also take this as a warning in its future work.
    An important principle of our Party life is that any Party member must live a strict organizational life and be subject to constant supervision by the masses. However, these principles have not been conscientiously observed by the Party organizations of many institutions and enterprises. In these institutions and enterprises, the Party's organizational life is very unsound. Responsible Party members often do not attend Party meetings, so they cannot hear criticisms from the organization and criticisms from their subordinates. Even if they do hear them, some ignore them, do not respond, and do not change, resembling a patriarchal rule. This hinders the development of the enthusiasm of Party members and the masses, and makes it impossible to discover and correct shortcomings and errors in the work in a timely manner. In recent years, some cadres and masses of the Shenyang Transformer Factory have not been without opinions on issues such as the poor product quality of the factory; however, because the leading personnel refused criticism, they did not dare to raise their opinions even if they had them. This is also an important reason why errors were able to develop. In order to avoid similar situations from continuing to occur, the higher-level Party and government leading organizations need to take some effective measures to promote democracy and give play to the supervisory role of the masses.
    Since the Fourth Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Party in 1954, bourgeois individualism and arrogance within the Party have been greatly overcome, and the Party's unity has been greatly strengthened. However, incidents like the Shenyang Transformer Factory are not isolated. Therefore, it is still necessary to draw the serious attention of all enterprise leaders and even all leaders to this issue.

### 不可忽视的教训

    不可忽视的教训
    本报七月二十三日发表了一个消息说，国营沈阳变压器厂的厂长和党委书记等重要领导人员，从卑鄙的资产阶级个人主义出发，忘记了自己所担负的神圣职责，长期闹无原则纠纷，严重地放松了甚至放弃了对生产建设工作的领导和监督，以致这个厂发生了大量损失、浪费和积压国家资财的现象，发生了严重的损坏机器设备的事件。这是一个不可忽视的教训。
    许多事实证明，在我们共产党员和革命工作人员中间，一方面有很多人把国家和人民的利益看得高于一切，他们经常关心的是工作的好坏，是党和国家的建设计划和政策法令的贯彻执行，他们有一种高贵的共产主义的道德品质，是我们的事业不断发展的重要保证。而另一方面，也有不少人十分缺乏共产主义的自觉性和对人民事业的责任感。他们所关心的不是党和人民的事业，而是个人地位的高低和权力的大小。这样，党和国家就不仅不能通过他们来组织领导广大群众，促进建设事业的发展，反而会因为他们的严重错误和失职行为，而使国家和人民的利益蒙受重大的损失。沈阳变压器厂的事件只是一个例子罢了。
    国营沈阳变压器厂是我国生产变压器的唯一工厂，又是五年计划期间国家投资扩建的限额以上的工厂，它的生产建设工作的好坏，直接影响着国家的社会主义工业建设。国家委派任俊杰同志担任这个厂的厂长，党组织选派郎宗颖同志担任这个厂的党委书记。把一个重要的工厂交付给他们领导，这表示党和国家对他们是十分信任的。按说，在这样严重的任务面前，任俊杰和郎宗颖二位同志应该在工作中实行亲密的合作，领导和团结全厂干部和职工群众，共同搞好全厂的生产和工作，这才不会辜负党和国家对他们的信任。但是，事实完全不是这样，任、郎两人为了个人权力的大小而闹无原则的纠纷，根本把党和国家对自己的付托置诸脑后。他们两人都有着浓厚的个人主义和骄傲自满情绪。一个认为自己既然是厂长，就可以不接受党的领导和监督。另一个认为自己既然是党委书记，到厂时间最早，厂内的多数干部又都是自己亲手培养和提拔起来的，那么厂内的大权就应当由自己一手独揽。他们为个人的权力问题经常地比高论低，争论“谁说了算”，“谁领导谁”。他们对于厂内破坏生产、损坏机器的惊人现象，却熟视无睹，无动于衷。很明显，在这样的厂长和党委书记领导下的沈阳变压器厂，要想很好地完成各方面的指标，贯彻执行国家的政策法令，把生产和基本建设工作搞好，那是完全不可思议的。
    沈阳变压器厂因为领导人员闹不团结而造成的政治、经济的损失是严重的。我们的所有企业机关以及其他机关，都有必要从这一事件中吸取教训。
    最重要的教训是党和行政的领导人员，必须经常警惕自己脑子里的资产阶级个人主义思想。谁有了这种思想而长期不注意加以克服，任它发展，就必然会在工作中犯严重的错误。在一定的条件下，甚至会发展到背叛党和人民的地步。这要算是一个规律，已经为无数的事实所证明。在沈阳变压器厂的事件中可以看到，当任俊杰和郎宗颖等人热中于个人的权力而展开斗争的时候，他们就在工作中发生了严重的官僚主义错误和失职行为。厂长任俊杰平日很少下车间，只凭听汇报，因而对损坏机器的许多严重情况都不知道，产品质量中的许多重大问题也长期得不到解决，结果造成次品废品充斥，各种事故不断发生。党委书记郎宗颖把生产和工作中的问题单纯当作攻击任俊杰的资本，自己并没有想出什么积极的办法来改变现状。卑鄙的资产阶级思想和个人的权力欲望，甚至使他们走上了欺骗党和国家的可耻道路。他们对上隐瞒工作中的缺点错误和严重情况，谎报成绩，窃取了荣誉和大量的奖金。如果不是这次彻底揭发和处理，他们的错误将会发展到不堪设想的地步。
    另一个重要的教训是中央的主管部局和地方党组织有必要经常派人深入到厂矿企业中去，检查企业工作和国家政策法令的执行情况，随时随地发现问题，解决问题，决不要等到问题积了一大堆才去检查处理。沈阳变压器厂领导人员闹不团结的问题所以长期不得解决，反而愈发展愈严重，这是和他们的上级领导机关——原第一机械工业部电气工业管理局领导方面的官僚主义作风分不开的。这个局对沈阳变压器厂的问题早有发现，却长期不作认真的检查和处理，反而盲目相信他们的假报告，介绍他们的假经验，并且发给大量的奖金。这种瞎了眼睛的领导作风迟早总要宣告破产的。
    从沈阳变压器厂的事件中还应该得出一个教训，这就是必须加强当地党委对厂矿企业的领导。中共沈阳市委对变压器厂领导人的错误并不是一无所知的；但是，他们却因为该厂直接受着中央主管部门的领导，就不敢负责处理这个事件，并且也不及时向上级报告，以致这个厂领导人员的错误发展得更加严重了。对于这一点，中共沈阳市委也应该在今后的工作中引为鉴戒。
    我们党内生活的重要原则是任何党员必须过严格的组织生活，受到群众经常的监督。但是这些原则还没有被许多机关、企业的党组织切实遵守。在这些机关和企业里，党的组织生活很不健全，负责的党员常常可以不参加党的会议，所以也就听不到组织的批评和下面同志的批评，听到了也有的不理睬，不答复，不转变，很像是家长式的统治。这就妨碍了党员和群众的积极性的发挥，使工作中的缺点错误不能及时发现和纠正。这几年来，沈阳变压器厂的一些干部和群众，对这个厂的产品质量低劣等问题不是没有意见，但是，因为领导人员拒绝批评，他们有意见也不敢提出。这也是错误得以发展的一个重要原因。为了避免类似情况继续发生，上级党政领导机关有必要采取一些有效的措施来发扬民主，发挥群众性的监督作用。
    自从1954年党的七届四中全会以后，党内的资产阶级个人主义和骄傲情绪已经有了很大的克服，党的团结有了很大的加强。但是，像沈阳变压器厂这类事件还不是个别的。所以在这个问题上现在仍然有必要提起所有企业领导人员乃至一切领导人员的严重注意。
