Xinhua News Agency, July 5th: Finnish Speaker of Parliament, Mr. Sukselainen, hosted a farewell banquet tonight to bid farewell to Chinese state leaders and people from all walks of life. He said that the visit of the Finnish parliamentary delegation to China has brought your distant country closer to us.

    芬兰议会议长举行临别宴会
    新华社5日讯　芬兰议会议长苏克舍拉宁今晚举行临别宴会，向中国国家领导工作人员和各界人士辞行。他说，芬兰议会访华代表团这次访问中国，使你们这个遥远的国家同我们更加亲近了。
    苏克舍拉宁在会上说：希望不久将来我们也能在芬兰接待中国议会代表团。他提议为芬中两国议会间的不断合作，为毛泽东主席的健康而干杯。
    今晚有二百多位中国和芬兰人士在这里欢叙一堂。坐在苏克舍拉宁席旁的是刘少奇委员长，周恩来总理坐在芬兰驻华大使孙士敦的席旁。和他们坐在一起的还有副委员长李济深、沈钧儒，副委员长、北京市市长彭真。席间他们谈到了大国和小国问题。中国国家领导者们说，中国是一向为尊重小国而努力的。苏克舍拉宁站起来向全体赴宴的人们说，中国在这方面“已经作得很成功了”。他又建议大家为此而干杯。
    在宴会开始的时候，苏克舍拉宁还致词说，代表团在中国参观访问期间，非常重视中国人民——上自国家领导人物，乃至普通工人农民对我们所表现的特别友情。
    他说，我们所受到的这种热情欢迎，是世界上少有的真正的友谊。这是促进国际间相互了解的伟大事业的真诚努力。这教导了我们去热爱这个曾遭受过许多苦难而现在仍在为克服困难进行斗争的人民。
    席间，刘少奇委员长说：“通过这次两国议会间的直接接触，将使今后中芬两国之间的友好合作更加密切起来。”
    “在这个离别的前夕，”刘少奇说：“请代表团把我国人民的友好敬意，转达给贵国人民。”他提议为吉科宁总统的健康而干杯。
    周恩来总理在会上祝酒时希望进一步增进中芬两国间的文化交流，彼此交换教授和留学生。他还希望代表团能把中国政府这个愿望转告给芬兰政府。彭真也在会上向苏克舍拉宁祝了酒。
    今晚，李维汉和陈叔通副委员长，邓子恢和陈毅副总理，全国人民代表大会常务委员会委员、外交部副部长张闻天和其他各部负责人，各人民团体负责人，各界著名人士和北京市副市长都应邀出席了宴会。
    会后放映了芬兰电影。
