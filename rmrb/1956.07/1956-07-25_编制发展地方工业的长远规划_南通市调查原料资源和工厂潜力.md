According to Xinhua Daily, Nantong City, Jiangsu Province, has substantial industrial resources and potential in its existing enterprises. This conclusion was reached by Nantong City's leading departments based on preliminary investigation and research while compiling proposals for the Second Five-Year Plan and formulating the plan for the Third Five-Year Plan.

Nantong City is located near a vast cotton-producing area. With the mechanization of cotton-growing areas, the output of raw cotton will increase significantly. This will not only further develop the textile industry and cottonseed oil extraction industry, but also allow the use of cotton burr fiber to develop flax textile and paper-making industries. Nantong City is also near the river and the sea, with abundant aquatic resources, providing material conditions for the development of fishing, aquaculture, and fish processing industries. At the same time, a large number of aquatic shells can be used to manufacture a large amount of shell ash to replace cement, adapting to the development of basic construction.

In researching the utilization of industrial by-products and waste materials, Nantong City has also discovered many resources. For example, cottonseed hulls can be chemically treated to produce alcohol and furfural; oil residues from oil extraction plants can be used to refine glycerin and oleic acid; oil extraction plants can produce a large amount of linters by simply adding some delinting equipment; and cotton waste from textile factories can be re-spun and used as raw material for the knitting industry to manufacture coarse yarn for raised socks, Russian hats, carpets, etc.

Existing industrial enterprises also have great potential after technical transformation. For example, in the textile industry, as long as technical transformations such as the modification of single-process cotton openers are carried out, 39,000 new spindles can be installed without building new factory buildings; production capacity can also be greatly increased through the balancing of equipment in the front and rear spinning and weaving sections.

    编制发展地方工业的长远规划
    南通市调查原料资源和工厂潜力
    据新华日报消息　江苏省南通市的工业资源和现有企业的潜力很大。这是南通市领导部门在编制第二个五年计划建议数和拟订第三个五年计划的规划中，根据初步调查研究得出来的结论。
    南通市邻近广大的产棉区。随着棉区耕种的机械化，原棉的产量将有很大的增长，这不但可以进一步发展纺织工业和棉子榨油工业，并且可以利用棉皮秆纤维来发展麻纺织及造纸工业。南通市又滨江近海，水产资源也很丰富，为发展捕捞、养殖及鱼类加工工业提供了物质条件；同时利用大量的水产壳类还可以制造大量的壳灰，以代替水泥，适应基本建设事业的发展。
    在研究利用工业副产品、下脚废料方面，南通市也发掘了许多资源。如棉子壳通过化学处理可制造酒精和糠醛；榨油厂的油脚可以提炼甘油和油酸；榨油厂只要增加一些脱绒设备，就可以大量生产短绒；纺织厂的下脚棉经过再纺可作为针织业制造拉绒袜子、罗宋帽、地毯等的粗纱原料。
    现有工业企业经过技术改造以后，潜力也是很大的。如纺织工业，只要进行改装单程式清花机等技术改造，就可以在不增建厂房的条件下，安装新纱锭三万九千枚；通过前后纺和织部的设备平衡，也可以大大增加生产能力。
