Xinhua News Agency, Mustagh Ata, July 21st (Xinhua reporter Yang Kexian): The members of the Sino-Soviet joint mountaineering team established the fourth camp on Mustagh Ata at an altitude of 6,800 meters above sea level on the afternoon of the 20th.

This altitude is higher than any reached by the famous Swedish traveler Sven Hedin, who attempted to climb Mustagh Ata four times over sixty years ago, without success.

In recent days, the weather on Mustagh Ata has been constantly changing. In the early days of the second expedition, the Sino-Soviet mountaineering team members often advanced through patches of dark clouds. On the 20th, the weather cleared up, and Mustagh Ata was covered in a dazzling expanse of white snow. Due to the thin air and knee-deep snow, and carrying heavy loads, the Sino-Soviet mountaineering team members encountered great difficulties moving from the third camp at 6,170 meters above sea level to the 6,800-meter camp. The team members needed more than half a minute and two or three breaths for a very small step. They had to rest every hundred or so steps.

The young Chinese team members, who had eaten very little for two days and were exhausted, were driven by their tenacious will to climb step by step to the fourth high-altitude camp.

    中、苏混合爬山队
    建立第四号高山营地
    据新华社慕士塔格山21日电新华社记者杨克现报道：中、苏混合爬山队的队员们，二十日下午在慕士塔格山的拔海六千八百公尺处建立了第四号营地。
    这样高的地方，是瑞典著名的旅行家斯文·赫定在六十多年前四次攀登慕士塔格山，一次也无法攀登上去的地方。
    近日来，慕士塔格山上天气变化无常。在第二次进军的最初几天，中、苏爬山队队员经常穿过一片片的乌云前进。二十日，天气放晴，慕士塔格山上是一片白皑皑的耀眼的积雪。由于氧气稀薄，雪深及膝，负荷很重；中、苏爬山队队员从拔海六千一百七十公尺的第三号营地到达六千八百公尺的营地，遇到了极大的困难。队员们移动很小一步，需要多半分钟和喘两、三口气。走百把十步就要休息。
    年轻的中国队员们，已经两天很少吃饭，四肢疲备无力，但是坚韧的意志促使他们一步步登上了第四号高山宿营地。
