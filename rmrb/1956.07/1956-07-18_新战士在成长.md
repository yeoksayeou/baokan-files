New Soldiers Growing Up

    First Parachute Jump
    A parachute unit of the airborne troops held a parachute jumping exercise in May. Newly enlisted soldiers also participated in this jump. The paratroopers controlled their parachutes according to regulations, acting skillfully, calmly, and bravely, and all landed safely.
    The new recruits were very satisfied with this parachute jumping exercise. They said: Three months ago, we were just farmers who had never seen a parachute jump. After this experience, we are confident in becoming excellent paratroopers.

    On Duty Like Veteran Soldiers
    Quan Zude, a clerk in the 3rd Company of a certain unit, enlisted this March. After only one month of training, his self-recording speed has reached 185 characters per minute, and his listening-recording speed has reached 170 characters per minute. According to regulations, a recording clerk who can record 170 characters per minute during the entire training period this year is considered qualified. In this way, Quan Zude has already reached the training target for nine months.
    Initially, Quan Zude just practiced diligently with a pencil, without paying attention to methods. Although he practiced very quickly, the quality was not high. The squad leader and veteran recording clerks told him about their experience in writing numbers quickly and clearly. Quan Zude accepted his comrades' guidance and quickly got the hang of it. Now he can be on duty like veteran comrades.

    Achieving Three Years' Target in One Year
    Xu Kuizhang, who enlisted in 1955, is a radio operator in an independent communications battalion of a certain unit. After a year of hard study, he has reached the training target for three years. Over the past year, he has seized every available moment to practice continuously, even murmuring "Da-di, da-di..." while walking. Now he can receive 30 groups per minute, send 27 groups per minute, and reach 780 groups per 60 minutes in targeted communication. He reached the level of a first-class radio operator in February of this year. He received a "pre-detachment commendation" from the battalion and was promoted to sergeant.

   Newcomers on the Shooting Range
    This was a trial shooting that aroused the interest of all officers and soldiers of a certain battalion. Participating in the trial shooting were newcomers to the shooting range - Li Yongbang, Wang Ruyao, Jiang Shude, Ye Jinzhang, and Wang Xiuming. They are all new recruits who enlisted this year.
    After arduous preliminary studies following their enlistment, this was their first time participating in a trial shooting on the shooting range. The youngest, Li Yongbang, was the first to step onto the shooting platform. He was indeed a little nervous. When the commander issued the firing command, he pushed in the bullet and was preparing to aim when suddenly his right hand slipped backward. With a "bang," the bullet flew out. The accidental misfire made people worry about him. Li Yongbang was so flustered that he even forgot to eject the cartridge. He thought: Is this how my first shooting ends? No! I must shoot the other two bullets well. After thinking for a while, he began to calm down. As a result, the second shot hit the outer ring, and the third shot hit the inner ring, achieving a good result.
    Wang Ruyao learned from Li Yongbang's experience and prepared to shoot calmly after stepping onto the shooting platform. He made up his mind: I will not shoot unless it meets the requirements. The first shot was very good, and the following two shots were even more calm. The result was three out of three hits, with the bullet impact points forming a triangle with a diameter of less than six centimeters in the center of the inner ring.
    Next, Wang Xiuming, Ye Jinzhang, and Jiang Shude conducted shooting, and their results were all good.
    The trial shooting ended, and the five newcomers on the shooting range strengthened the confidence of all new recruits in achieving good results in their first practice. However, they are not satisfied with their achievements. They are earnestly summarizing their experiences with the help of instructors, striving to become excellent shooters in this year's training.

### 新战士在成长

    新战士在成长
    初次跳伞
    伞兵某部队在五月份举行了一次跳伞练习。新入伍的士兵也都参加了这次跳伞。跳伞员按照规定操纵降落伞，动作熟练，沉着勇敢，全部安全着陆。
    新兵们对这次跳伞练习都感到非常满意。他们说：三个月前我们还是个农民，从没见过跳伞。经过这次尝试，我们有信心做一个优秀的跳伞员。
    和老战士一样值班
    某部三连记录兵全祖德，是今年三月应征入伍的，参加训练才一个月，他的自记分速已达一百八十五个字，听记分速已达一百七十个字。按照规定，今年记录兵在全训练期每分钟记一百七十个字就算及格。这样一来，全祖德已经达到了九个月的训练指标。
    开始，全祖德只是拿着铅笔一股劲地练习，不讲究方法。虽然练的速度很快，但质量不高。班长和老记录兵就告诉他写数字既快又清楚的经验。全祖德接受了同志们的指导，很快就摸到了门路。现在他已经能和老同志一样值班了。
    一年达到三年指标
    1955年入伍的许奎章，是某部独立通信营的无线电员，他经过一年的刻苦学习，已经达到了三年的训练指标。一年来，他抓住一切可以利用的时间不断地练习，甚至走着路都叨念着：“达地，达地……。”现在能每分钟收报三十组，发报二十七组，专向通报定额每六十分钟达到七百八十组。今年二月份就达到了一级无线电员的水平。他得到了营的“队前嘉奖”，并晋升为下士。
  射击场上的新手
    这是一次引起某营全体官兵兴趣的试射。参加试射的是射击场上的新手——李永邦、王如耀、蒋树德、叶金章和王修明。他们都是今年应征入伍的新兵。
    这是他们入伍后，经过艰苦的预习，第一次到射击场上参加试射的。最年轻的李永邦，首先登上射击台，他的心里确实有些慌，当指挥员发出射击的口令以后，他推上子弹正准备瞄准，突然右手往后一滑，“砰”的一声，子弹飞出去了。意外的走火，使人们都为他着急，李永邦一时慌得连退子弹壳都忘了。他想：第一次射击就这样结束了吗？不！另外两发子弹一定要打好。他思索一会，开始沉着起来。结果，第二枪中了外环，第三枪中了内环，成绩是良好。
    王如耀吸取李永邦的经验，登上射击台以后，不慌不忙地准备射击。他打定了主意：不合要领坚决不打。第一枪打得很好，以后的两枪更沉着了。结果是三发三中，弹着点在内环中心排成一个直径不到六公分的三角形。
    接着，王修明、叶金章、蒋树德进行射击，成绩都是良好。
    试射结束了，五位射击场上的新手，给全营新兵增强了打好第一次练习的信心。但他们并不满足自己的成绩，他们正在教练员的帮助下认真地总结自己的经验，争取在今年的训练中成为优秀射手。（附图片）
