    Taking a Step Back to Advance Two Steps
    Xiao Guang
    On July 3rd, U.S. Vice President Richard Nixon, who was visiting the Philippines, and Philippine President Magsaysay issued a joint statement. Nixon, in the statement, adopted the pose of a benefactor, stating: "The United States recognizes the complete sovereignty of the Philippines over the U.S. military bases in the Philippines, and the United States guarantees to relinquish all ownership of these bases." That is to say, prior to this, the Philippines had no sovereignty whatsoever over the U.S. military bases built on its own territory, even though the United States had loudly proclaimed the granting of independence to the Philippines as early as July 1946.
    In order to conceal this point, Nixon added an unnecessary detail to the statement: "The United States has always recognized Philippine sovereignty over these bases since Philippine independence."
    This kind of defense is quite ridiculous. If the facts were really as Nixon said, why would Nixon need to announce that the United States "guarantees to relinquish" ownership of these bases?
    As everyone knows, when the United States declared the Philippines independent in 1946, it retained all of its naval, land, and air force bases in the Philippines. In order to permanently occupy these bases, U.S. Attorney General Herbert Brownell announced in 1953 that the bases occupied by the United States before granting the Philippines independence in 1946 still belonged to the U.S. government. In 1954, Brownell again said that the United States owned the naval and land military bases in the Philippines. At the beginning of this year, U.S. Secretary of the Navy Thomas publicly stated that the issue of ownership of U.S. bases in the Philippines needed to be submitted to the U.S. President for review. At the same time, U.S. military authorities continued to seize tens of thousands of hectares of farmland and mining areas in the Philippines to expand the bases. They arbitrarily stipulated management regulations in the base areas, appointed mayors at will, levied exorbitant taxes, interfered with the functions of Philippine local governments, and even openly established military checkpoints on Philippine national highways. As Philippine House Speaker Jose Laurel said, "It seems that we are indeed being treated as intruders rather than masters, as subordinate people rather than a sovereign nation on our own territory."
    This situation has aroused widespread indignation among the Philippine public, coupled with the United States' endless control and exploitation of the Philippines in political and economic aspects, Filipinos are increasingly aware that the independence granted by the United States to the Philippines is a kind of "independence without sovereignty." Currently, in the Philippines, anti-American sentiment is growing, and calls for improving relations between the United States and the Philippines have crossed party lines.
    The U.S. government sent Nixon to the Philippines this time precisely to deal with this situation. The Associated Press said that Nixon's trip was aimed at easing Philippine dissatisfaction and trying to make the Philippines have a "better" attitude toward the United States. However, whether the United States can get its wish does not depend on what means Nixon uses, but on the actual actions taken by the United States in changing the unequal relationship between the United States and the Philippines. In this regard, people have not seen anything. On the contrary, the United States has come up with a new trick of "I give you sovereignty, you give me territory." In the joint statement, the United States, on the one hand, fully acknowledges Philippine territorial sovereignty, and on the other hand, unreasonably demands that the Philippine government "provide more land" to the United States as military bases. The United States is playing the trick of "taking a step back to advance two steps": using "recognition of sovereignty" as a concession to ease Philippine public anger, and taking the opportunity to expand its military bases in the Philippines.
    However, the Philippine public, familiar with this kind of U.S. tactic, will never let the U.S. plan be realized. Several senators, led by Philippine Senator Recto, have firmly expressed their opposition to the United States expanding its bases in the Philippines, believing that "this is harming our interests and further weakening our sovereignty." Now that the Philippine people have forced the United States to recognize Philippine ownership of the U.S. bases, as long as they persist in the struggle to safeguard Philippine sovereignty and independence, they will surely thwart the U.S. conspiracy.

    退一步，进两步
    萧光
    七月三日，访问菲律宾的美国副总统尼克松和菲律宾总统麦格赛赛发表了一篇联合声明。尼克松在声明里作出一副恩施主的姿态，表示：“美国承认菲律宾对美国在菲律宾的军事基地享有完全的主权，美国保证将让出这些基地的一切所有权”。也就是说，在此以前，菲律宾对于建立在自己领土上的美国军事基地没有丝毫主权；虽然早在1946年7月，美国就已大吹大擂地宣告赋予菲律宾独立。
    为了掩饰这点，尼克松在声明中画蛇添足地补充道：“美国从菲律宾独立以来一直都承认菲律宾对这些基地的主权。”
    这种辩解是十分可笑的。如果事实真是同尼克松所说的一样，尼克松为什么又要宣布美国“保证让出”这些基地的所有权呢？
    大家知道，美国在1946年宣布赋予菲律宾独立的时候，保留了它在菲律宾的全部海、陆、空军基地。为了永远霸占这些基地，美国司法部长赫伯特·布朗纳尔在1953年宣布：在1946年授予菲律宾独立以前美国所占据的基地仍旧属于美国政府。1954年，布朗纳尔又说，美国对于在菲律宾的海军和陆军军事基地拥有所有权。今年年初，美国海军部长托马斯公开声明，菲律宾的美国基地所有权的问题需要提交美国总统审核。与此同时，美国军事当局继续侵占菲律宾数万公顷的耕地和矿区来扩建基地。他们在基地区域里擅自规定管理条例，随意任命市长，征收苛捐杂税，干涉菲律宾地方政府的职权，甚至公然在菲律宾的国有公路上设立军事检查站。正如菲律宾众议院议长何塞·劳雷尔所说的，“看来我们在我们的领土上的确是被人当作闯入者而不是主人，被当作附属人民而不是主权国家。”
    这种情况激起了菲律宾公众的普遍愤慨，加上美国对于菲律宾政治和经济等方面进行毫无止境的控制和榨取，菲律宾人越来越清楚地感到美国给予菲的独立是一种“没有主权的独立。”目前，在菲律宾，反对美国的情绪日益强烈，要求改善美国同菲律宾关系的呼声已经越过了党派的界线。
    美国政府这次派尼克松去菲律宾，正是为了对付这种情况。美联社说，尼克松此行目的是要缓和菲律宾的不满情绪，设法使菲律宾对美国有“比较好的”态度。但是，美国能不能如其所愿，不在于尼克松运用什么样的手段，而要看美国在改变美、菲之间的不平等关系方面采取的实际行动。在这方面人们却什么也没有看到。相反的，美国想出了“我给你主权，你给我领土”的新花招。美国在联合声明中一面满口承认菲律宾的领土主权，一面无理要求菲律宾政府“提供更多的土地”给美国作为军事基地。美国打的是“退一步，进两步”的如意算盘：利用“承认主权”作些让步来缓和菲律宾的民愤，随着乘机扩大它在菲律宾的军事基地。
    但是，熟悉美国这种手法的菲律宾公众决不会让美国的计划兑现。以菲律宾参议员雷克托为首的几个议员已坚决表示反对美国扩大它在菲律宾的基地，认为“这是损害我们的利益和进一步削弱我们的主权的。”菲律宾人民既然已经迫使美国承认了菲律宾对美国基地的所有权，只要他们坚持维护菲律宾主权独立的斗争，就一定能挫败美国的阴谋。
