Resolutions of the Third Session of the First National People's Congress
Resolution on the State Final Accounts and the State Budget
(Adopted on June 30, 1956, at the Third Session of the First National People's Congress)

I.
The Third Session of the First National People's Congress, having heard the report by Li Xiannian, Vice Premier of the State Council and Minister of Finance, on the 1955 State Final Accounts and the 1956 State Budget, after discussions in group meetings and plenary sessions, and having heard the examination report of the Budget Committee of the current National People's Congress, resolves:

(1) To approve the 1955 State Final Accounts, with a total revenue of 30,357,976,000 yuan and a total expenditure of 29,346,938,000 yuan, and to agree to transfer the 1955 surplus of 1,011,038,000 yuan for use in the 1956 budget.

(2) To approve the 1956 State Budget, with a total revenue and total expenditure each amounting to 30,742,770,000 yuan.

(3) To agree with the various guidelines and measures proposed by Li Xiannian, Vice Premier of the State Council and Minister of Finance, in his report regarding the realization of the 1956 State Budget.

(4) To estimate that certain unpredictable changes may occur during the execution of the budget. The State Council may, based on the changes in circumstances and the spirit of this resolution, make certain necessary and appropriate adjustments, and report to the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress within a certain period.

II.

The execution of the 1955 State Budget guaranteed the needs for the development of all aspects of the national economy, and the execution was generally good. Despite the impact of the severe floods of the previous year, significant progress was made in all aspects of national construction in 1955, and the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and private industry and commerce also advanced rapidly. The nationwide movement to practice thrift and oppose waste, which was launched in 1955, effectively saved the state's financial expenditures, overcame the phenomenon of extravagance and waste in many departments, and enabled us to do more with the same amount of money. The results were remarkable. The Congress is basically satisfied with the execution of the 1955 State Budget and the development of the national economy.

However, the following shortcomings also existed in the execution of the 1955 State Budget:

(1) Although industrial production exceeded the plan in 1955, many enterprises one-sidedly pursued output and output value, and did not simultaneously pay attention to improving quality, reducing costs, and increasing variety. Coupled with the limitations of raw material shortages, the quality of many products was poor, costs were too high, and varieties did not meet the needs of users, which affected sales and consequently affected the completion of the state budget revenue plan.

(2) The revenue plan of state-owned commerce was not completed in 1955. In addition to various objective difficulties and overly large tasks, the shortcomings of the commercial work itself were also an important reason. The arrangement of urban and rural commercial networks by commercial departments did not keep up with the development of objective conditions. The allocation and distribution of many commodities did not conform to the natural laws of commodity circulation. Coupled with various shortcomings in processing orders and business management, this resulted in phenomena such as certain varieties not being suitable, goods arriving at the wrong time, inventory backlog in some places, and stockouts in others. This affected the expansion of commodity circulation and the reduction of circulation costs, and affected the satisfaction of people's needs.

(3) When reducing investment in capital construction, timely attention was not paid to making necessary and comprehensive arrangements based on the investment reduction. Moreover, due to insufficient preparation for capital construction work, necessary reserve projects were not prepared. As a result, some projects were suspended or left idle after the investment was reduced, and the saved funds could not be fully utilized within the year. Secondly, insufficient attention was paid to certain urgently needed non-productive constructions, and the investment in some projects was reduced inappropriately, which affected the construction progress and quality of workers' dormitories, municipal construction, and other auxiliary buildings.

(4) The expenditure on social, cultural, and educational affairs in 1955 only reached 82.82% of the original budget. In addition to factors such as rational improvement of quotas and cost savings by cultural and educational departments, this was also due to some work systems not being reasonably stipulated, which prevented the timely adjustment and use of budget funds and hindered the solution of many problems. For example, in many schools, cultural institutions, and scientific research institutions, some equipment that should have been purchased was not purchased, some classrooms and dormitories that should have been built were not built, and some difficulties that should and could have been resolved were not resolved. In many medical and health units, there were insufficient beds, charging standards were too high, and the approval of free treatment was too strictly controlled. Insufficient consideration was also given to the special needs of cultural, educational, and health undertakings in minority areas.

(5) The division of authority between the central and local finances, and between the finance departments and the financial affairs of various business departments, is not entirely suitable for the current situation. Some of the regulations of the finance departments are too detailed and too strict. There are also shortcomings in the central government's handling of the previous year's surplus in local areas. These shortcomings, to a certain extent, have restricted the initiative and enthusiasm of local areas and departments, making it difficult for them to make timely and necessary adjustments and arrangements within the total budget based on actual conditions. The situation in which local areas and departments, on the one hand, cannot spend all the money and, on the other hand, cannot do some things because they do not have money, is related to the shortcomings of the work of the finance departments.

III.

The National People's Congress believes that the 1956 State Budget's revenue plan takes into account both the needs and the possibilities. Although the local surcharges and village self-raised portions of the agricultural tax burden on farmers in 1956 are slightly higher than in 1955, the proportion of the total agricultural tax burden in the total agricultural output value still does not exceed 12%, which is still lower than the proportion in 1952, and is therefore appropriate. The 1956 State Budget's expenditure plan appropriately arranges the investment ratio between heavy industry and light industry, and between industry and agriculture, and takes into account both the needs of national construction and the needs of improving the people's material and cultural lives. These are all correct.

The realization of the 1956 State Budget will financially guarantee the early completion of the first Five-Year Plan for the development of our national economy, and guarantee the further improvement and enhancement of the people's material and cultural lives. This budget reflects the high tide of socialism in our country, reflects the desire of our people to build the motherland peacefully, and also reflects the will, confidence, and strength of our people to build socialism. The Congress believes that the realization of this budget is the common glorious task of all ethnic groups, democratic parties, people's organizations, government departments, and local people's committees at all levels throughout the country.

The National People's Congress believes that in the process of implementing the 1956 State Budget, it is necessary to oppose conservatism while also opposing the tendency of rash advance; it is necessary to comprehensively pay attention to more, faster, better, and more economical, and safety. Not only should we achieve more and faster, but also better and more economical, and ensure safe production. Under this general policy, special attention should be paid to the following points:

(1) The accumulation of state-owned enterprises has become the main source of state budget revenue. In order to guarantee the completion of the 1956 State Budget revenue plan, all industrial enterprises should strive to increase variety, improve quality, and reduce costs; they should carefully budget and use the least production consumption to complete the largest production results. Commercial departments should strive to improve business management, reduce damage and loss, and reduce commodity circulation costs. They should also adapt to changes in the situation, gradually adjust urban and rural commercial networks, practically improve the allocation and distribution of commodities, and better take care of urban and rural needs, and serve production and consumers. At the same time, they should also gradually adjust the relationship between industry and commerce according to the new situation, so as to be conducive to production and commodity circulation.

(2) Completing the 1956 agricultural production increase plan is of great significance for realizing the 1956 State Budget revenue plan. People's committees at all levels, agricultural production cooperatives in various places, and all farmers should implement the policy of "running cooperatives diligently and thriftily," strive to increase the production of grain, cotton, and other cash crops, strive to develop rural sideline occupations, expand diversified operations, strive for greater agricultural harvests, and enable the vast majority of farmers to increase their personal income on the basis of increased production. Relevant economic departments should do a good job in issuing agricultural loans, purchasing agricultural and sideline products, and other economic work, and effectively support agricultural production increase.

(3) The primary task of the 1956 State Budget expenditure plan is to realize the capital construction plan. In order to complete the huge capital construction task in 1956, attention should be paid to comprehensive preparatory work, attention should be paid to the connection and balance of various links such as surveying, designing, supplying equipment and materials, organizing construction and installation, and preparing necessary reserve projects; we should strengthen the adjustment and supply of materials and equipment to meet the needs of capital construction as much as possible; departments should be allowed to make reasonable adjustments between projects within the scope of the capital construction budget according to actual conditions; and in the arrangement and adjustment of capital construction, attention should be paid to the construction of workers' housing and urban municipal construction.

(4) Continuously improving the people's material and cultural life on the basis of production development is our constant and fundamental task. The 1956 State Budget has made appropriate arrangements for the growth of wages for all employees (including rural primary school teachers, supply and marketing cooperative staff, and full-time rural cadres); in addition, we should further improve the supply of materials to employees, do a good job in employee welfare work, and pay attention to protecting the safety and health of employees in production. The work and life of private individuals and small business owners in joint state-private enterprises should be further properly resolved. Appropriate arrangements should also be made for the business and life of small vendors and hawkers. Cultural, educational, and health departments should take measures to correct shortcomings in their work and better meet the people's requirements for culture, education, and healthcare, and pay more attention to the special needs of cultural, educational, and health undertakings in minority areas.

(5) Financial departments should adapt to the development of the national economy, formulate new systems, revise old systems, simplify procedures, and improve efficiency, so as to make them more suitable for actual needs and conducive to the smooth progress of various undertakings. Financial departments should also pay attention to studying economic conditions and strengthen financial supervision and inspection. Regarding the financial system, the correct principle should be the combination of the central government's unified leadership and unified planning with the local division of responsibilities and adapting to local conditions, and correctly giving play to the enthusiasm and initiative of local management of finances. For the 1956 local budget, the National People's Congress decided to only approve the total revenue and expenditure. In the process of implementation, various regions can make necessary adjustments based on the overall consideration of the state's long-term plan and the current actual needs. In addition, financial departments should pay attention to the combination of the state budget and bank credit at any time, and pay attention to the balance of cash.

The National People's Congress believes that it must be emphasized that increasing production and practicing economy is an important source of socialist capital accumulation and a major method for developing the socialist economy. Implementing a strict economic accounting system and a strict economy system, and ensuring the rational and effective use of funds, has always been a top priority in the entire socialist construction. Because only by increasing production and practicing economy, overcoming waste as much as possible, increasing income, and saving expenditures, can we enrich the state's financial strength and accelerate the progress of socialist construction. The several shortcomings that have occurred in the movement to increase production and practice economy should be overcome and can be overcome. Pointing out these shortcomings is not in any sense to relax the effort to increase production and practice economy, but to better continue to strengthen this effort.

The tasks stipulated in the 1956 State Budget are huge, and completing this task is arduous. The people of the whole country must work together, diligently and thriftily, improve their work, increase production, practice strict economy, and strive to fully realize the 1956 State Budget.

    第一届全国人民代表大会第三次会议的决议
    关于国家决算和国家预算的决议
    （1956年6月30日第一届全国人民代表大会第三次会议通过）
    一
    第一届全国人民代表大会第三次会议，听了国务院副总理兼财政部长李先念关于1955年国家决算和1956年国家预算的报告，经过小组会和大会的讨论，并且听了本届全国人民代表大会预算委员会的审查报告，决定：
    （一）批准1955年国家决算总收入30，357，976，000元，总支出29，346，938，000元，并且同意将1955年决算结余1，011，038，000元转列到1956年预算中使用。
    （二）批准1956年国家预算总收入和总支出各为30，742，770，000元。
    （三）同意国务院副总理兼财政部长李先念在报告中所提出的关于实现1956年国家预算的各项方针和措施。
    （四）估计在预算执行过程中会遇到某些现在还不能预料的情况变化，国务院可以根据情况的变化和本决议的精神，作某些必要的适当的调整，在一定时期向全国人民代表大会常务委员会报告。
    二
    1955年国家预算的执行，保证了国民经济各方面发展的需要，执行的情况基本上是良好的。1955年尽管有前一年严重水灾的影响，国家建设的各个方面，都有了很大的进展，农业、手工业和私营工商业的社会主义改造也迅速地前进了。1955年在全国范围内普遍展开的厉行节约、反对浪费的运动，有效地节约了国家的财政开支，克服了许多部门的铺张浪费的现象，使我们能够用同样多的钱，作较多的事，成绩是显著的。代表大会对于1955年国家预算的执行和国民经济的发展状况，基本上表示满意。
    但是1955年国家预算的执行中，也存在着如下的缺点：
    （一）1955年工业生产虽然超额地完成了计划，但是不少企业单位，片面地追求产量和产值，没有同时注意努力提高质量、降低成本、增加品种，加上原料困难的限制，以致不少产品质量不好，成本过高，品种不适合用户的需要，影响了销售，因而也影响了国家预算收入计划的完成。
    （二）1955年国营商业的收入计划没有完成，这除了各种客观困难和任务过大以外，商业工作本身的缺点也是重要的原因。商业部门对城乡商业网的安排赶不上客观情况的发展，许多商品的调拨分配不适合商品流转的自然规律，加上加工订货和经营管理方面的各种缺点，造成了若干品种不对路，到货不适时，这里积压、那里脱销，一时积压、一时脱销的现象，这就影响了商品流通的扩大和流转费用的降低，影响了人民需要的满足。
    （三）在削减基本建设投资的时候，没有及时注意根据投资削减的情况，作必要的全面的安排，并且由于对基本建设工作所进行的准备工作不够全面，也没有准备必要的预备项目，因而在投资削减以后造成了若干停工窝工现象，使得节约下来的资金，没有能够在本年内充分利用。其次，对于某些迫切需要的非生产性建设没有给以足够的注意，一部分投资削减得不适当，以致影响了职工宿舍、市政建设和其他辅助性建筑的建设进度和工程质量。
    （四）1955年社会文教费支出只达到原预算的82.82％，这除了由于文教部门合理地改进定额、节约开支等因素以外，还由于一部分工作制度规定得不尽合理，致使预算资金不能及时地调剂使用，妨碍了许多问题的解决。比如在许多学校、文化事业单位和科学研究机关有些应当购置的设备没有购置，有些应当修建的教室宿舍没有修建，有些应当而且可以解决的困难没有解决；又如在许多医疗卫生单位，病床不足，收费标准偏高，免费的批准也控制过严，等等。对于少数民族地区文教卫生事业的特殊需要，也有照顾不够的地方。
    （五）中央财政同地方财政、财政部门同各业务部门财务的权限划分，不完全适合目前的情况；财政部门的若干制度规定得过细过严；中央财政对地方上年结余的处理也有缺点。这些缺点，在一定程度上束缚了各地方各部门的主动性和积极性，使他们难于根据实际情况，在预算总额的范围内，作及时的必要的调整和安排。各地方各部门在预算执行当中，一方面钱用不完，一方面有些事情又因为没有钱而不能办的情况，是同财政部门工作的缺点有关的。
    三
    全国人民代表大会认为：1956年国家预算的收入计划，既照顾了需要，也照顾了可能。在1956年农民的农业税负担中，虽然地方附加和乡村自筹部分比1955年略有增加，但是农业税负担总额在农业总产量中所占的比例，仍然不超过12％，即仍然低于1952年的比例，因而是适当的。1956年国家预算的支出计划，恰当地安排了重工业和轻工业、工业和农业之间的投资的比例，兼顾了国家建设的需要和改善人民物质、文化生活的需要，这些都是正确的。
    1956年国家预算的实现，将从财政上保证我国发展国民经济的第一个五年计划的提前完成，保证人民物质、文化生活的进一步改善和提高。这个预算反映了我国社会主义的高潮，反映了我国人民和平建设祖国的愿望，也反映了我国人民建设社会主义的意志、信心和力量。代表大会认为，实现这个预算是全国各族人民、各民主党派、各人民团体、政府各部门和地方各级人民委员会的共同的光荣任务。
    全国人民代表大会认为：在执行1956年国家预算过程中，必须在反对保守主义的时候，同时反对急躁冒进倾向；必须全面地注意多、快、好、省和安全，不仅要做到多和快，而且要做到好和省，要做到安全生产。在这个总的方针下，应当特别注意以下各点：
    （一）国营企业的积累已经成为国家预算收入的主要来源。为了保证1956年国家预算收入计划的完成，一切工业企业，应当努力增加品种，提高质量，降低成本；应当精打细算，用最小的生产消耗，完成最大的生产成果。商业各部门应当努力改善经营管理，减少伤耗损失，降低商品流转费用，并且要适应情况的变化，逐步调整城乡商业网，切实改进商品的调拨分配，更好地照顾城乡需要，为生产和消费者服务。同时，还应当根据新的情况，逐步调整工商关系，使之有利于生产和商品流通。
    （二）完成1956年的农业增产计划，对于实现1956年国家预算收入计划有重大的意义。各级人民委员会、各地农业生产合作社和全体农民，应当贯彻执行“勤俭办社”的方针，努力增产粮食、棉花和其他经济作物，努力发展农村副业，扩大多种经营，争取更大的农业丰收，并且使绝大多数农民能够在增加生产的基础上增加个人收入。各有关经济部门，应当做好农业贷款的发放工作、农副产品的收购工作和其他经济工作，有效地支援农业增产。
    （三）1956年国家预算支出计划的首要任务是实现基本建设计划。为了完成1956年巨大的基本建设任务，应当注意进行全面的准备工作，注意勘察、设计、供应设备和材料、组织施工和安装等各个环节的衔接和平衡，并且准备必要的预备项目；应当加强材料和设备的调剂供应工作，以尽可能满足基本建设的需要；应当允许各部门在基本建设预算的范围以内，根据实际情况，在项目之间作合理的调整；在基本建设的安排和调整当中，应当注意职工住宅的修建和城市的市政建设。
    （四）在生产发展的基础上不断改善人民的物质和文化生活，是我们经常的根本的任务。1956年国家预算，已经对全国职工（包括乡村小学教职员、供销合作社工作人员和乡村专职干部）的工资的增长作了适当的安排；除此以外，还应当进一步做好对职工的物资供应工作，做好职工福利工作，并且注意保护职工在生产中的安全和健康。对公私合营企业中私方人员和小业主的工作和生活，应当进一步加以妥善解决。对小商小贩的营业和生活，也应当进一步给以适当的安排。文化、教育和卫生部门应当采取措施，改正工作中存在的缺点，更好地满足人民对文化、教育和保健的要求，更多地注意少数民族地区文教卫生事业的特殊需要。
    （五）财政部门应当适应国民经济发展的情况，拟定新的制度，修改旧的制度，并且简化手续，提高效率，使之更加适合于实际需要，有利于各项事业的顺利进行。财政部门还应当注意研究经济情况，加强财政的监督和检查。关于财政体制问题，正确的原则，应当是中央的统一领导、统一计划同地方的分工负责、因地制宜相结合，正确地发挥地方管理财政的积极性和主动性。1956年的地方预算，全国人民代表大会决定只作收支总额的批准，各地在执行过程中，可以根据国家长远规划和当前的实际需要，通盘考虑，作必要的调整。此外，财政部门还应当随时注意国家预算同银行信贷的结合，注意现金的平衡。
    全国人民代表大会认为必须强调指出：增产节约是社会主义资金积累的重要源泉，是发展社会主义经济的主要方法。实行严格的经济核算制度和严格的节约制度，保证资金的合理和有效地使用，始终是整个社会主义建设当中的头等重要的问题。因为只有实行增产节约，尽一切可能克服浪费，增加收入，节省支出，才能充实国家的财政力量，加速社会主义建设的进度。增产节约运动中发生的若干缺点，是应当克服和可以克服的。指出这些缺点，不是在任何意义上放松增产节约的努力，而是为了更好地继续加强这一努力。
    1956年国家预算所规定的任务是巨大的，完成这个任务是艰巨的。全国人民必须一致努力，克勤克俭，改进工作，增加生产，厉行节约，为完满实现1956年国家预算而奋斗。
