    Sixty Years and Six Years
    ——The Past and Present of China's Textile Industry
    Wang Jingyu
    The cotton textile industry is an important industrial sector related to the people's livelihood. After liberation, China's cotton textile industry entered a completely new historical period, embarked on a path of healthy development for the first time, and presented a beautiful prospect. We know that the old Chinese cotton textile industry struggled for a full sixty years. However, the achievements were very pitiful. The achievements of the new China's cotton textile industry in the three years of economic recovery and the first three years of the first five-year plan have already exceeded the achievements of the old China in sixty years.
    In order to explain the achievements of the new six years, let us first look back at the old sixty years.
    The sixty years experienced by the old Chinese cotton textile industry was a very difficult process. China's first cotton textile factory, the Shanghai Cotton Cloth Weaving Bureau, started operations in 1890. The preparation for this factory took twelve years. When preparations began in 1878, foreign cotton yarn had already opened the market in China, but foreign capital had not yet been invested in China's cotton textile industry. This was originally a good opportunity for the development of China's cotton textile industry, but this factory had to develop a relationship with the high-ranking official Li Hongzhang during its preparation stage in order to obtain protection. Li Hongzhang not only extended his influence into the Shanghai Cotton Cloth Weaving Bureau, but also later restricted the establishment of other cotton textile factories, attempting to monopolize the profits of the entire cotton textile industry. Thus, China's cotton textile industry could not escape the control of feudal bureaucrats in its early stages.
    After the Sino-Japanese War in 1895, China's cotton textile industry received some impetus from both the top and bottom. In the five years from 1895 to 1899, a total of ten cotton textile factories were established, with 188,000 spindles, marking the first upsurge in factory establishment. However, at the same time, imperialist capital had already begun to invest heavily in China's cotton textile industry. In 1897 alone, Britain, the United States, and Germany established four cotton textile factories in Shanghai, and their capital and production scale far exceeded China's cotton textile factories at the time. Then, in 1902, Japan's Mitsui extended its investment tentacles to Shanghai, followed by Naigaiwata. Thus, on the eve of World War I, foreign capital amounted to nearly 13 million yuan, exceeding the capital of Chinese cotton textile factories by more than 30% during the same period.
    The large influx of foreign capital into China's cotton textile industry not only took away the sales market of national industries, but also directly merged with the cotton textile factories of national capital. As early as 1897, the Chinese Yujin Yarn Factory, which had been established for less than two years, had already fallen into the hands of British capital; Japanese imperialism basically began its activities by merging Chinese cotton textile factories. The two factories of the Shanghai Textile Co., Ltd., operated by Mitsui, were reorganized by acquiring the Chinese Xingtai and Dachun yarn factories. As of 1912, a total of six Chinese cotton textile factories had been merged by Japan or controlled by it due to loan relations, with a total of 150,000 spindles, equivalent to 30% of the total number of spindles in Chinese cotton textile factories in 1912.
    Therefore, in the twenty years before World War I, although China's cotton textile industry had made some initial progress, it had already formed a disadvantageous situation in the face of the powerful capital of imperialism. After the outbreak of World War I, the pressure of foreign goods on the Chinese cotton market was temporarily reduced, and Western countries were also temporarily unable to continue expanding their investments in China, so China's cotton textile industry gained some opportunities for development. But this brief prosperity did not escape Japan's attention. Japan's cotton industry trust saw this opportunity and moved the spindles and looms originally planned to be installed domestically to China one by one. In the two years from 1921 to 1922 alone, Japan established 12 cotton textile factories in Shanghai, Qingdao and other places, with a total of nearly 300,000 spindles. At the same time, Japanese imperialism also took advantage of the instability of Chinese factories to wedge capital into some newly established Chinese cotton textile factories that were experiencing difficulties in capital turnover. In total, 13 Chinese factories had debt relations with Japanese monopoly capital, seven of which were eventually merged by Japan.
    The Kuomintang's reactionary rule, which began in 1927, did not alleviate the difficulties of China's cotton textile industry; on the contrary, it made China's cotton textile industry even more difficult. In addition to the squeeze in terms of donations and taxes, it also used the financial power of bureaucratic capital to control private cotton textile factories in terms of capital. From 1931 until the outbreak of the War of Resistance Against Japan, the Kuomintang's Bank of China and its peripheral institutions, such as the China Cotton Industry Corporation, had relations with private cotton textile factories in various ways, totaling eighteen. At the same time, the Japanese imperialists' mergers of Chinese cotton textile factories became increasingly fierce. After 1931, the Northeast fell, and North China was in danger. The North China cotton textile industry, under the overturned nest, almost all fell into the hands of Japanese imperialism. In 1936 alone, a total of six cotton textile factories in Tangshan, Tianjin and other places were merged by Japan, and their number of spindles was equivalent to 6.3% of the national Chinese cotton textile factories. Those who remained were precarious and could not end their days. This is how China's cotton textile industry spent the dark first 10 years of the Kuomintang rule under the mutual oppression of the Kuomintang reactionaries and Japanese imperialism. After the start of the War of Resistance Against Japan, cotton textile factories concentrated in Shanghai, Tianjin and other places were directly damaged by the war. Only a few cotton textile factories in the Wuhan, Shashi, and Zhengzhou areas moved to the rear, with only over 100,000 spindles. During the entire War of Resistance Against Japan, the process experienced by the cotton textile industry in the Kuomintang-controlled areas was even more tragic than the first decade of the Kuomintang's dark rule. During the war, the Kuomintang reactionary government adopted a fascist-style control policy for the production and sales of cotton yarn and cloth, implemented unified purchase and sales of yarn and cloth, contract spinning and weaving, and used the methods of "controlling yarn with cotton, controlling cloth with yarn, and controlling prices with cloth" to requisition and plunder the production of the few remaining private cotton textile factories in the rear. The "official price" of unified purchase and sales was far lower than the market price; the "processing fee" for contract spinning and weaving was far lower than the cost. Private cotton textile factories had no choice but to suspend production and close down under this mandatory requisition policy. As a result, among the more than 300,000 spindles existing in large yarn factories in the rear in 1942, only 176,000 were in operation. The number of spindles was equivalent to 10% of the national spindles before the war, while the output was only 4% of that before the war. The cotton textile industry, which had undergone countless hardships and relocations to the rear, encountered such a tragic fate!
    The cotton textile industry in the occupied areas was another tragic scene. After Japanese imperialism occupied North China and Central China, it first put the Chinese cotton textile factories remaining in the occupied areas under military management or entrusted them to Japanese textile institutions in China for operation. Some servile Chinese capitalists "cooperated" with the enemy in order to return their properties, but the fate of the cotton textile industry in the occupied areas was completely in the hands of the enemy. Because Japan was a country with a developed yarn industry but insufficient cotton production, its domestic cotton needs had always relied on foreign assistance. During the war, especially after the outbreak of the Pacific War, the sources of American and Indian cotton, which had always been imported in large quantities, were cut off, and Japan's imported cotton only had one source left: North China. Cotton constituted one of the four major resources (coal, iron, cotton, salt) that Japan reached out to seize from colonial China. At that time, in North China, in order to supply the needs of the Japanese mainland, even the factories under military management could not be fully put into operation due to insufficient cotton. As for the so-called private factories, under the distribution of "two for the military and one for the people," they were of course in a state of suspended animation.
    After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, China's cotton textile industry became the world of bureaucratic capital. The Kuomintang's China Textile Company took over 85 large and small Japanese puppet cotton, wool, linen, and silk factories, as well as printing and dyeing, cotton ginning, and packaging factories in Shanghai, Tianjin, Qingdao, and the Northeast. It possessed 46% of the country's spindles and 83% of the looms, forming an unprecedentedly large textile monopoly. However, with such large-scale equipment in the hands of the Kuomintang, its production remained at a very low level. The average turnover rate of its spindles and looms in 1946 was less than 50%, and the lowest was only 19% (spindles) and even 14% (looms). The monthly yarn production rate only reached 37% of the standard yarn production rate, which was 57% lower than the average yarn production rate of Chinese yarn factories before the Anti-Japanese War. Bureaucratic capitalism was an extremely corrupt and parasitic economic form.
    In dealing with the private cotton textile industry, the Kuomintang adopted a more stringent control policy than during the Anti-Japanese War under the slogan of "stabilizing prices." On the one hand, it stipulated that private yarn factories must first "have the government purchase half of the cotton yarn made from foreign cotton at the limited price" as a condition for allocating foreign cotton; on the other hand, it implemented the so-called "negotiated price" method, forcing private yarn factories to sell the other half of the cotton yarn at prices lower than the cost. When the cotton yarn arrived in their hands, the Kuomintang could manipulate it to make huge profits. In this way, the Kuomintang extended two money-grabbing bloody hands to the private cotton textile industry. In this way, more than two million spindles accumulated by the private cotton textile industry in sixty years almost fell into a state of complete shutdown during the darkest period of the Kuomintang rule.
    The contrast between the past sixty years of the cotton textile industry and the new era of six years makes the changes too obvious.
    First of all, in the six years, the development speed of the cotton textile industry has greatly exceeded historical records. From the second year of the founding of New China, while restoring, transforming, and expanding the original factories, the state began to build new factories in the interior. Therefore, during the economic recovery period, the production equipment of the cotton textile industry was not only fully restored, but also exceeded the highest level in history. In 1952, on the eve of the first five-year plan, the number of spindles in the country had reached 5.66 million, exceeding the highest figure in history by 11%. In the first five-year plan, the planned number of newly built cotton textile factories was 38. After all these cotton textile factories are completed, they can add a total of 1.89 million spindles and 54,500 looms, which are equivalent to 66% and 214% of the highest figures accumulated by private cotton textile factories in the old China in 60 years, respectively. We mentioned above that the golden age of the cotton textile industry in the old China was during World War I, but during this period, the increase in the number of spindles was only 300,000, which was less than one-sixth of the increase stipulated in our country's first five-year plan. The new China's cotton textile industry has such a high development speed, which the people of the old era could not have dreamed of.
    Secondly, the colonial nature of the old Chinese cotton textile industry has changed. The cotton textile industry in semi-feudal and semi-colonial China had a very strong colonial nature, which was prominently manifested in the following phenomena: in 60 years, the old Chinese cotton textile industry accumulated more than 4 million spindles, but China could not produce a single spindle and had to obtain all of them from foreign countries; China is a cotton-producing country, and the interior and northwest have vast cotton-producing areas, but China's yarn factories are rarely located in the interior of the cotton-producing areas, and more than 50% of the spindles are concentrated in the Shanghai, Nantong, and Wuxi triangular areas, while most of the raw materials needed are obtained from imported American and Indian cotton. This deformed phenomenon has been completely changed in the new six years. Now we have our own independent textile machinery manufacturing industry, and we are able to fully equip new textile factories with complete sets of domestic textile machinery. On the other hand, the state actively supports the production of industrial raw material crops, so that the cotton needed by cotton textile factories can basically be self-sufficient. At the same time, the state has established new cotton textile industrial bases in the interior and northwest regions, and a large number of new factories have been established in Zhengzhou, Xi'an, Urumqi and other places close to the cotton-producing areas, so that the regional distribution of the cotton textile industry meets the needs of the people of the whole country.
    The relations of production in the cotton textile industry have also changed. We not only transformed the bureaucratic capital's China Textile Company into a socialist state-owned enterprise, but also gradually carried out the socialist transformation of private cotton textile industry in these six years. In the period of entering the first five-year plan, the ratio of socialist components to capitalist components in the textile industry has undergone major changes. In 1953, the proportion of spindles in state-owned and joint state-private enterprises in the country's spindles increased from 47.61% in 1949 to 65.23%. In 1955, the work of joint state-private operation of private textile enterprises made great progress. In this year, the cotton textile industry jointly operated more than 780,000 spindles and 4,451 looms, accounting for 93.27% and 82.20% of the total spindles and looms of private enterprises at the end of 1954, respectively. By the end of 1955, the private cotton textile industry had basically been incorporated into the track of state capitalism and embarked on a path of healthy development.
    The change in the relations of production in the cotton textile industry has made the productive forces develop by leaps and bounds. After liberation, the textile industry carried out democratic reforms and production reforms, and the labor enthusiasm and creativity of the working class were fully developed, and new working methods continued to emerge. The summary and promotion of advanced experiences such as Hao Jianxiu's fine yarn working method, the 1951 weaving working method, and the 1953 textile machinery maintenance working method, as well as other advanced experiences such as saving cotton and reducing costs, greatly improved the labor productivity of the cotton textile industry, and quickly broke through the highest level in history. The labor productivity of the old Chinese cotton textile factories, calculated by the average unit output, was 0.022 kg per spindle per hour for 20-count yarn at the highest, while in 1953 it had reached 0.027 kg, an increase of 23%. We mentioned earlier that the China Textile Company, under the control of the Kuomintang bureaucratic capital, had a yarn production rate that was 57% lower than that of private yarn factories. The miracle of going from 57% lower to 23% higher in just a few years can only occur after the relations of production have been changed.
    Due to the improvement of productivity, the textile industry has played a significant role in the state's capital accumulation. According to statistics from 1952 to 1954, if the number of accumulated funds in 1952 is taken as 100, then it was 120.34 in 1953 and 140.61 in 1954. Here, we can see that the development of the cotton textile industry not only meets the people's living needs, but also is an important source of capital accumulation for the state's socialist industrialization. The improvement of productivity has also directly improved the workers' working conditions and material and cultural life. The workers in the cotton textile industry in the old China suffered from the severe exploitation of imperialism and bureaucratic capital. The capitalists in the private cotton textile industry, due to the squeeze from imperialism and bureaucratic capital, could only find a way out by desperately exploiting the workers, so the exploitation of workers in the private cotton textile factories was also very serious. It has been calculated that the exploitation rate in the old Chinese private yarn factories was as high as 220% or more. It can be seen that all capitalists are equally disregarding the life and death of workers in exploiting them. Only in the new China has this situation fundamentally changed. In the new China's cotton textile industry, the state has implemented an eight-hour working day, changing the system of more than ten hours of working day that has been followed for decades in the past. At the same time, many major measures have been taken to focus on solving the main problems of labor protection, such as cooling, dust removal, and safety devices. The investment in ventilation and cooling equipment alone has reached 20.63 million yuan by 1953. The state has also gradually increased workers' wages, so that the actual income of employees has increased year by year. In addition, various active measures have been taken in workers' housing, medical care, health care, and cultural education. With the development of cotton textile production, the people's consumption of cotton textiles has also been improved. On the eve of the first five-year plan, the cotton yarn production exceeded the highest annual output in history by 48%; the cotton cloth production exceeded 105%. After the completion of the first five-year plan, the output of cotton yarn and cotton cloth will reach 5 million pieces and 163.721 million pieces, respectively. By the time of entering the second five-year plan, the national consumption of cloth will average 19.24 meters per person, exceeding the highest consumption of cotton cloth before liberation by 51%. At the same time, the state has repeatedly lowered the ratio of cloth prices to agricultural and livestock products. Taking the four main agricultural and livestock products of rice, millet, wheat, and wool as examples, in the four years from 1950 to 1954, the ratio of white cloth to these four products decreased by 7%, 5%, 25%, and 45%, respectively. This is a reflection of the principle of improving people's lives, especially the lives of farmers and herdsmen, in the price policy, which has powerfully consolidated the worker-peasant alliance and strengthened national unity.
    After comparing the old and new eras of the cotton textile industry, we have unlimited confidence in its bright prospects. Of course, we must not forget that the foundation of the cotton textile industry left to us by the old China is very weak. The spindles it left to us accounted for only 3.3% of the total number of spindles in the world, which is extremely disproportionate to the proportion of our country's population in the world. At present, the consumption level of cotton textiles for the people of the whole country is still relatively low. We are now carrying out the great cause of socialist construction. Socialist construction requires us to prioritize the development of heavy industry. Only when heavy industry is developed, will all light industries, including the textile industry, have a solid foundation. In just a few years after liberation, our country has been able to fully equip newly built textile factories with complete sets of domestic textile machinery and has completed the achievements that could not be completed in the past 60 years. This is proof. Therefore, the policy of prioritizing the development of heavy industry is completely correct. However, we must fully estimate the degree of growth of the people's need for cotton textiles and the contradiction between the need and production of cotton textiles. After liberation, the production of cotton textiles and the people's need for cotton textiles have been growing at the same time, but the increase in production often lags behind the increase in need. For example, in the four years from 1949 to 1953, the production of cotton yarn increased by 126.32% (in 1955, due to insufficient raw material supply, the output of cotton yarn and cotton cloth decreased by 14% and 16% respectively compared with 1954), while the sales volume increased by 133%. With the continued improvement of people's lives, especially after the agricultural cooperation movement, farmers' requirements for cotton textiles in terms of quantity and quality will be greatly improved, and they require more and better cotton textiles. They account for five-sixths of the country's population, and their expenditure on cotton textiles accounts for about 12% of the total expenditure. A slight negligence in quality will cause them to lose hundreds of millions of yuan. This requires us to put in more effort in reducing waste, exploiting potential, and improving quality. We should cheer for the achievements we have already made, but we cannot be satisfied with the achievements we have already made. Let us make more and better achievements.

    六十年和六年
    ——中国纺织工业的过去和现在
    汪敬虞
    棉纺织工业是关系人民生活的一个重要工业部门。解放以后，中国的棉纺织工业进入了一个完全新的历史时期，第一次走上了健康发展的道路，呈现出一幅美好的远景。我们知道，旧中国的棉纺织工业，曾经奋斗了整整六十年。然而成绩是很可怜的。新中国的棉纺织工业，在三年经济恢复时期和第一个五年计划的前三年里面，其成就就已经超过旧中国六十年所得的成绩了。
    为了说明新的六年的成就，让我们首先回顾一下旧的六十年吧。
    旧中国棉纺织工业所经历的六十年，是一个非常艰难的过程。中国第一个棉纺织厂——上海织布局，是1890年开车的。这个厂的筹办，经历了十二年的时间。当1878年开始筹办的时候，外国棉纱已经在中国打开了市场，而外国资本还没有投向中国的棉纺织工业中来。这对中国的棉纺织工业，本来是一个很好的发展机会，但是，这个厂在它的筹办阶段，就不得不和大官僚李鸿章发生关系，以求得到庇护。李鸿章不但把自己的势力伸入上海织布局，而且以后还限制其他棉纺织厂的设立，企图垄断整个棉纺织工业的利润。这样，中国的棉纺织工业，在它出生的初期，就逃不了封建大官僚的控制。
    1895年中日战争以后，中国的棉纺织工业，从上下两方面得到了一些推动。在1895—1899五年中，一共设立了十个棉纺织厂，18.8万枚纺锭，出现第一次设厂高潮。但是，与此同时，帝国主义的资本，却已开始大规模地投向中国的棉纺织业了。在1897年一年之中，英、美、德三个国家，就在上海设立了四个棉纺织厂，它们在资本和生产规模上都大大超过了中国当时的棉纺织厂。接着在1902年间，日本的三井，把投资的触角，伸向上海，内外棉也跟踪而来。这样，在第一次世界大战的前夕，外国资本差不多达到1，300万元，超过了同期中国棉纺织厂资本30％以上。
    外国资本大量涌入中国棉纺织工业，不但夺去民族工业的销售市场，而且对民族资本的棉纺织厂进行直接的兼并。早在1897年，成立不及两年的中国裕晋纱厂，就已经落入英国资本的掌握之中；日本帝国主义则根本就是以兼并中国棉纺织厂开始活动的。由三井经营的上海纺织株式会社的两个工厂，就是收买中国的兴泰、大纯两纱厂改组而成的。截至1912年止，中国棉纺织厂之为日本兼并或因借款关系而受其控制的，共有六家，纺锭总数达到15万枚，相当于1912年中国棉纺织厂纺锭总数的30％。
    因此，在第一次世界大战以前的二十年间，中国的棉纺织工业，虽然有了一些初步的发展，但在帝国主义强大资本的面前，已经形成了劣势的局面。第一次世界大战爆发后，中国棉货市场上洋货的压力暂时减轻，西方国家也暂时难以继续扩充它们在中国的投资，因而中国的棉纺织工业，获得了一些发展的机会。但是这个短暂的繁荣，没有躲得过日本的注意。日本的棉业托辣斯看准了这一机会，把原来准备在国内装置的纺锭和织机，一一搬运到中国来。单是在1921—22两年间，日本在上海、青岛等地，就设立了12家棉纺织厂，纺锭总数将近30万枚。日本帝国主义同时还利用华厂基础的不稳固，把资本楔入到一些新设的和资金周转发生困难的中国棉纺织厂中来。总计前后曾经和日本垄断资本发生债务关系的华厂凡13家，其中有七家最后为日本所兼并。
    1927年开始的国民党反动统治，没有减轻中国棉纺织业的困难，相反，它使中国的棉纺织工业，更加陷入了艰难的处境。它除了在捐税等方面的压榨以外，还通过官僚资本的金融势力，对民营棉纺织厂进行资本上的控制。从1931年起，一直到抗日战争爆发以前，国民党的中国银行及其外围机构如中国棉业公司等，通过各种方式和民营棉纺织厂发生关系的，前前后后，共有十八家。同时，日本帝国主义对中国棉纺织厂的兼并，也愈来愈趋激烈。1931年以后，东北沦陷，华北危急，处在复巢之下的华北棉纺织业，也就几乎全部落入日本帝国主义的掌中。在1936年一年之间，唐山、天津等地的棉纺织厂为日本所兼并者，一共就有六家，它们的纺锭数目，相当于全国华商棉纺织厂的6.3％。其残存者，则风雨飘摇，不可终日。中国的棉纺织工业，就是这样在国民党反动派和日帝国主义交相煎逼之下，度过了国民党统治最初10年的黑暗时期。抗日战争开始以后，集中在上海、天津等地的棉纺织厂，直接遭受到战争的破坏。只有武汉、沙市、郑州一带少数几家棉纺织厂，迁到后方，纺锭不过十余万枚。在整个抗日战争时期，国民党统治区棉纺织工业所经历的过程，比国民党黑暗统治的第一个十年，还要悲惨。战时国民党反动政府对花纱布的产销，采取了法西斯式的管制政策，实行纱布统购统销，代纺代织，“以花控纱，以纱控布，以布控价”的办法，对后方仅有的少数几家民营棉纺织厂的生产，进行了征发和掠夺。统购统销的“官价”既远远低于市价；代纺代织的“工缴”，则远远低于成本。民营棉纺织厂处于这种强制征发政策之下，只有出于停工闭厂之一途。以至1942年后方大型纱厂现有的三十余万枚纺锭中，开工的只有17.6万枚，纺锭数目相当于战前全国纺锭的10％，而产量则只及战前的4％。经历了无数辛苦辗转迁移到后方的棉纺织工业，所遭遇到的，就是这样悲惨的命运！
    沦陷区的棉纺织业，又是另一种悲惨的景象。日本帝国主义占领了华北、华中以后，首先把留在沦陷区的中国棉纺织厂进行军管理或委托日本在华纺织机构加以经营。一些奴颜婢膝的中国资本家，为了发还产业而和敌人进行了“合作”，但沦陷区棉纺织工业的命运，完全掌握在敌人的手中。由于日本是一个纱业发达而棉产不足的国家，它本国所需的棉花一向依赖外国的接济。在战争时期，特别是在太平洋战争发生以后，向来入口大宗的美棉和印棉来源断绝，日本入口棉花，只剩下华北一个来源。棉花构成了日本伸手向殖民地中国攫取的两黑（煤、铁）两白（棉、盐）四项主要资源之一。当时华北棉花，为了接济日本本土的需要，甚至军管理的工厂也因棉花不足，无法全部开工。至于所谓民营工厂，在“军二民一”的分配底下，当然更是陷入不死不生的境地了。
    抗战胜利以后，中国的棉纺织工业，变成了官僚资本的天下。国民党的中纺公司，一手接收了上海、天津、青岛和东北大大小小85家日伪的棉、毛、麻、绢工厂以及印染、轧花、打包等附属工厂，它拥有全国的46％的纺锭和83％的织机，形成了史无前例的庞大纺织垄断机构。但是这样大规模的设备在国民党的手中，它的生产，却停留在非常低下的状态。它的纺锭和织机的转运数额，在1946年平均不到50％，最低的时候只有19％（纺锭）乃至14％（织机），每月产纱率只达到标准产纱率的37％，比抗战前华商纱厂的平均产纱率还要低57％，官僚资本主义，是一个极端腐朽的寄生的经济形态。
    在对待民营的棉纺织工业上，国民党在“平抑物价”的口号底下，采取了比抗战时期更为严格的控制政策。它一面规定民营纱厂凡以外棉制成的棉纱，必须先“由政府照限价收购半数”，以为核配外棉的条件；一面又实行所谓“议价”办法，迫使民营纱厂以低于成本的价格出售另一半棉纱。等到棉纱到了手中，国民党又可以进行操纵，以获厚利。就在这样一进一出之间，国民党向民营棉纺织工业伸出了两只捞钱的血手。就这样，民营棉纺织工业六十年中积累的二百多万纺锭，在国民党统治的最黑暗时期，几乎陷入完全停止运转的局面。
    把棉纺织工业过去的六十年和新时代的六年加以对比，变化就太明显了。
    首先，六年中棉纺织工业，在发展的速度上，大大地超过了历史的纪录。从新中国成立的第二年起，国家在恢复、改造和扩建原有工厂的同时，就开始在内地陆续建设新厂。因此，在经济恢复时期，棉纺织工业的生产设备，不但得到了完全的恢复，而且还超过了历史上的最高水平。在第一个五年计划前夕的1952年，全国纺锭的数目，已经达到566万枚，超过历史上最高数字11％。在第一个五年计划中，新建的棉纺织厂，计划为38个，这些棉纺织厂全部建成后，共可增加纺锭189万枚，织机5.45万台，二者分别相当于旧中国民营棉纺织厂60年来积累的最高数字的66％和214％。我们在上面提到，旧中国棉纺织工业的黄金时代，是在第一次世界大战时期，但是在这一段时期里面，纺锭数目的增加，不过30万枚，还不及我国第一个五年计划中所规定的增加数字的六分之一。新中国棉纺织工业有这样高的发展速度，这是旧时代的人们梦想不到的。
    其次，旧中国棉纺织业殖民地性的面貌改变了。半封建半殖民地中国的棉纺织工业，具有很浓厚的殖民地性，这突出地表现在以下这些现象上：旧中国的棉纺织工业，在60年中，累积了400多万枚纺锭，但是中国却不能生产一枚锭子，而必需全部取给于外国；中国是一个产棉的国家，内地和西北拥有广大的产棉地区，但是中国的纱厂，却很少设在产棉区的内地，50％以上的纺锭，集中在上海、南通、无锡三角地区，而所需的原料则大部取给于入口的美、印棉花。这种畸形的现象，在新的六年中，得到了彻底的改变。现在我们已经有了自己的独立的纺织机械制造工业，我们已经能够完全用国产的全套纺织机器，装备新的纺织工厂。另一方面，国家积极扶助工业原料作物的生产，使棉纺织厂所需要的棉花，基本上能够自给自足。同时，国家在内地和西北地区，建立起新的棉纺织工业基地，大批的新厂，在接近产棉区的郑州、西安和乌鲁木齐等地建立起来，使棉纺织业在地区分布上符合全国人民的需要。
    棉纺织工业中的生产关系也改变了。我们不但把官僚资本的中纺公司，改变为社会主义的国营企业，而且在这六年中，对私营棉纺织工业，逐步进行了社会主义的改造。在进入第一个五年计划的时期，纺织工业中社会主义成分与资本主义成分的比重，已经起了重大的变化，1953年国营与公私合营企业的纺锭在全国纺锭中所占的比例，已由1949年的47.61％增加到65.23％。1955年私营纺织企业实行公私合营的工作有很大的进展，在这一年中，棉纺织业共合营纺锭78万余枚，织机4，451台，二者分别占全国1954年底私营企业全部纺锭和织机的93.27％和82.20％。到1955年底，私营棉纺织工业基本上都已经纳入国家资本主义的轨道，走上健康发展的道路。
    棉纺织工业中生产关系的改变，使生产力得到突飞猛进的发展。解放以后，纺织工业进行了民主改革和生产改革，工人阶级的劳动积极性和创造性，得到了充分的发挥，新的工作方法不断出现。如郝建秀细纱工作法、1951织布工作法和1953纺织机器保全工作法及其他节约用棉降低成本等先进经验的总结和推广，大大提高了棉纺织工业的劳动生产率，并且很快地就突破了历史上的最高水平。旧中国棉纺织厂的劳动生产率，拿平均单位产量计算，20支纱每锭每小时的产量，最高为0.022公斤，而在1953年则已经达到0.027公斤，提高了23％。我们在前面提到，中纺公司在国民党官僚资本控制之下，产纱率比民营纱厂要低57％，在短短数年中，由低于57％到高于23％。这种奇迹，只有在改变了生产关系以后，才能出现。
    由于生产力的提高，纺织工业在国家的资金积累方面，发挥了显著的作用。根据1952—1954年的统计，如果以1952年积累资金数字为100，则1953年为120.34，1954年为140.61，在这里，可以看到，棉纺织工业的发展，不但满足人民的生活需要，而且是国家社会主义工业化资金积累的一个重要来源。生产力的提高，也直接改善了工人的劳动条件和物质文化生活。旧中国的棉纺织业工人，受尽了帝国主义和官僚资本的严重剥削。民营的棉纺织工业资本家，由于受到帝国主义和官僚资本的排挤，也只有从拼命剥削工人中找出路，所以在民营棉纺织厂中，工人所受的剥削，也是非常严重的。曾经有人计算旧中国民营纱厂中的剥削率高到220％以上。可见所有的资本家，在剥削工人这一点上，都是同样不顾工人死活的。只有在新中国，这种情形，才有了根本的改变。在新中国的棉纺织工业中，国家实行了八小时工作制，一改过去相沿数十年的十小时以上的劳动日的制度。同时在集中解决劳动保护的主要问题——降温、除尘、安全装置等方面，采取了许多重大的措施。仅通风降温设备一项的投资，到1953年为止，就已经达到2，063万元。国家还逐步提高了工人的工资，使职工的实际收入，逐年得到增加。此外，在工人住宅、医疗、保健以及文化教育等方面，都采取了各种积极的措施。随着棉纺织业生产的发展，人民对棉纺织品的消费，也得到提高。在第一个五年计划前夕，棉纱生产量就超过了历史上最高年产量的48％；棉布生产量则超过105％。在完成第一个五年计划以后，棉纱和棉布的产量，将分别达到500万件和16，372.1万匹，到了进入第二个五年计划时期，全国布匹的消费量，平均每人可以达到19.24公尺，超过解放前棉布最高消费量的51％。同时，国家又多次调低了布匹对农畜产品的比价，以大米、小米、小麦、羊毛四项主要农畜产品为例，在1950—1954四年中，白布对这四项产品的比价，分别降低了7％、5％、25％、45％。这就是在价格政策上体现了改善人民生活、特别是农民和牧民生活的原则，有力地巩固了工农联盟，加强了民族团结。
    我们对照了棉纺织工业的新旧时代以后，对它的光明远景，具有无限的信心。当然，我们不能忘记，旧中国遗留给我们的棉纺织工业的基础，是非常薄弱的，它遗留给我们的纺锭，在全世界纺锭总数中，只占3.3％，这和我国人口在全世界中所占的比例是极不相称的。目前全国人民的棉纺织品的消费水平，还是比较低的。我们现在正在进行社会主义建设的伟大事业，社会主义的建设要求我们优先发展重工业，只有重工业发展了，一切轻工业包括纺织工业在内，才有了坚固的基础。我国在解放后短短几年中，已经能够完全用国产的全套纺织机器装备新建的纺织工厂，完成了过去60年所不能完成的业绩，这就是证明。因此，优先发展重工业的方针，是完全正确的。但是，我们对于人民对棉纺织品的需要的增长程度以及棉纺织品的需要和生产之间的矛盾，必须作出充分的估计。解放后，棉纺织品的生产和人民对棉纺织品的需要，都在同时增长，而生产的增加，却常常赶不上需要的增加。如1949至1953年四年间，棉纱的生产增加了126.32％，（1955年由于原料供应不足，棉纱和棉布的产量反较1954年分别减少了14％和16％），而销售量则增加了133％。随着人民生活的继续提高，特别是在农业合作化运动以后，农民对棉纺织品在数量和质量上的要求，将会大大提高，他们要求更多的、更好的棉纺织品。他们占全国人口六分之五，他们在棉纺织品上的支出，占全部支出12％左右，我们在质量上的稍许疏忽，就会给他们造成数亿元的损失。这就需要我们在减少浪费、发挥潜力、提高质量等方面，付出更多的努力。我们应该为已经取得的成就欢呼，但是，我们不能满足于已有的成就。让我们作出更多更好的成绩来。
