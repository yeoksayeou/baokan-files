Xinhua News Agency, July 29th: The United Front Work Department of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China has recently invited leaders of local organizations of democratic parties in Beijing and democratic figures from all walks of life to a forum on united front work.

Participating in the forums were representatives from various democratic parties, the industrial and commercial sector, ethnic minorities, religious circles, and other fields in Beijing, as well as some members of the Beijing Municipal People's Political Consultative Conference, totaling more than 150 people. Following these forums, districts and major universities held separate forums to continue soliciting opinions from democratic figures from all walks of life. The democratic parties in Beijing also held separate forums to offer opinions and criticisms on the united front work. Simultaneously, the Municipal Committee's United Front Work Department and the Chinese Communist Party Committee of the Municipal People's Committee jointly invited more than 40 non-Party deputy directors of bureaus directly under the municipality and non-Party deputy district heads from various districts to participate in a forum. More than 30 units from relevant municipal bureaus and commissions have also conducted self-assessments.

At the various forums, the democratic parties and democratic figures from all walks of life believed that the relationship between the Party and non-Party members has been basically normal in recent years. The achievements made by the democratic parties and democratic figures from all walks of life in various past endeavors are inseparable from the assistance of the CPC organizations. At the same time, they also raised many criticisms and suggestions to the Municipal Committee's United Front Work Department and its work.

Regarding the relationship with the democratic parties, participants at the forum generally felt that the Party was too polite to the democratic parties and did not provide enough political assistance. Some grassroots CPC organizations held a "respectful but distant" attitude towards the democratic parties, and some units did not pay attention to leveraging the proactive role of the democratic parties. To strengthen future ties, they suggested restoring the party-group symposium organized by the original Municipal Consultative Committee to address common issues among the parties.

During the forum, some participants pointed out that some units are not thoroughly implementing the Party's policy on intellectuals. Some units still improperly use intellectuals, and some units have not given the deserved honors to accomplished engineers. Regarding the issue of intellectuals joining the Party, things are vibrant in schools but lukewarm in government agencies.

Figures from the industrial and commercial sector believed that the work arrangements for capitalists and representatives of the capitalist side during the process of joint state-private ownership of capitalist industry and commerce were satisfactory. However, some capitalist personnel in joint factories and stores cannot effectively exercise their due powers in actual work. Some people pointed out that the relationship between workers and capitalists in some joint state-private factories and enterprises is not normal. Some workers and staff do not respect the administrative authority of capitalists, and some capitalists cannot humbly learn from workers and staff.

Many people believe that the Beijing Municipal People's Political Consultative Conference has done a lot of work, but it still has shortcomings, mainly in that consultations on major issues in the city are not sufficient. The initiative of the members has not been well utilized, and members should be allowed to participate more in the actual work of the CPPCC.

At the forum invited by the Municipal People's Committee for non-Party directors and deputy directors of its affiliated bureaus and non-Party deputy district heads from various districts, non-Party members believed that the Party was "more polite than helpful" to them. Some people reflected that because the director of some bureaus were non-Party members, the Municipal People's Committee often only went through the Party member deputy directors for many matters, and only criticized the Party member deputy directors when there were errors in the work. Sometimes, the transfer of cadres in their units was not discussed with them in advance; sometimes, the tasks assigned by the leaders were not communicated to them in a timely or clear manner.

Representatives from ethnic minorities and religious circles criticized some units for not paying attention to accommodating the living habits of ethnic minorities in their speeches. They also pointed out that some units do not provide enough assistance to some ethnic minorities who have difficulties in life.

The负责人 of the United Front Work Department of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China expressed sincere acceptance of the above criticisms and opinions, and conducted self-criticism on the shortcomings in the united front work. He stated that the United Front Work Department will work with various democratic parties and democratic figures from all walks of life to study the issues, opinions, and criticisms raised, and find ways to improve the work.

Currently, some of the issues raised in the forum have been resolved. For example, the United Front Work Department of the Municipal Committee has jointly studied and decided on the method of restoring the forums of various democratic parties with the leaders of the democratic parties.

    中共北京市委统战部邀各民主党派和各界人士座谈 
    广泛征求意见改善党和非党的关系
    新华社29日讯　中共北京市委统一战线工作部在最近一个时期内邀请了北京市各民主党派地方组织的负责人和各界民主人士座谈统一战线工作。
    分别参加座谈会的，有北京市各民主党派、工商界、少数民族、宗教界等各方面有代表性的人士，以及北京市人民政协的部分委员共一百五十多人。这些座谈会举行以后，各区和各大专学校分别举行了座谈会，继续征求各界民主人士的意见。北京市各民主党派也分别召开座谈会，对统战工作提出意见和批评。同时市委统战部和市人民委员会中共委员会又联合邀请了市级所属各局非党的正副局长和各区非党的副区长四十多人，进行了座谈。市级各有关局、委共有三十多个单位也已进行了检查。
    在各种座谈会上各民主党派和各界民主人士认为，几年来党和非党的关系基本上是正常的。各民主党派和各界民主人士过去在各种工作中作出的成绩是和中共组织的帮助分不开的。同时，他们对市委统战部和统战工作也提出了许多批评和建议。
    关于和各民主党派的关系，在座谈中他们都认为党对民主党派太客气，对民主党派政治上帮助不够，中共的一些基层组织对民主党派抱有“敬而远之”的态度，有些单位不注意发挥民主党派的积极作用。为了加强今后的联系，他们建议恢复原来市协商委员会组织的党派座谈会，以便解决各党派的一些共同问题。
    在座谈中有人指出：目前有些单位对于党对知识分子的政策贯彻执行得不够。有的单位对知识分子仍有使用不当的情况，有的单位对有成就的工程师还没有给予应得的荣誉。在对待知识分子入党问题上，学校里搞得火热，但机关里却冷冷清清。
    工商界人士认为在资本主义工商业公私合营过程中，对资本家和资方代理人的工作安排是满意的，但是有些合营的工厂和商店的资方人员在实际工作中不能很好地行使应有的职权。有些人提出，目前在一些公私合营的工厂企业里，工人和资本家的关系还不正常，有些工人、职员不尊重资本家的行政职权，有些资本家也不能虚心地向工人和职员学习。
    很多人都认为北京市人民政协作了许多工作，但还有缺点，主要的是协商本市较重大的问题还不够，还没有很好地发挥委员的积极性，让委员更多地参加政协的实际工作。
    在市人民委员会邀请所属各局非党正副局长和各区非党副区长的座谈会中，非党人士认为，党对他们
  “客气有余，帮助不足”。有些人反映，因为有的局局长是非党人士，市人民委员会有许多事只通过党员副局长，工作有错误也只批评党员副局长。有时本单位的干部调动，事前没有征求他们的意见；有时领导上布置的工作，对他们传达的不及时、不清楚。
    少数民族和宗教界代表人士在发言中，对一些单位不注意照顾少数民族的生活习惯，提出了批评。他们还指出有些单位对少数民族中一些生活困难的人帮助得也不够。
    中共北京市委统战部负责人表示诚恳地接受以上各方面的批评和意见，并就统战工作中的缺点进行了自我批评。他表示统战部将和各民主党派、各界民主人士一道对提出的问题、意见和批评进行研究，找出改进工作的办法。
    目前，座谈中提出的有些问题已得到解决。如市委统战部已和各民主党派负责人共同研究决定了恢复各民主党派座谈会的办法。
