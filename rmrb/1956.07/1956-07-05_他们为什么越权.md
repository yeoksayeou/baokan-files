    From January to April of this year, Yichuan County, Henan Province, developed 467 new Party members. These new Party members were all approved by Li Fufang and Fan Guangwen, cadres of the Organization Department of the Yichuan County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party. Originally, according to the instructions of the Henan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party: "After the abolition of districts and the merging of townships, the development of new Party members must be approved by the county committee." Since the "authority" to approve new Party members was with the county committee, why did these two organization cadres dare to "overstep their bounds"? It turns out that they were "acting on orders" and "couldn't help themselves"! When the county committee emphasized that "they were too busy to attend to it" and "granted" the authority to approve new Party members to the Organization Department, and the Minister of Organization, Li Shifang, further "granted" this authority to them, they once raised the opinion that this practice violated the spirit of the instructions of the higher-level Party committee and was probably inappropriate. However, Li Shifang, the Minister of Organization of the county committee, said: "You can't just listen to what they say." We don't understand, as the Minister of Organization of the county committee, who should Li Shifang listen to if not the higher-level Party committee? We also want to ask the Yichuan County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, you say you are "too busy to attend to it," is the approval of new Party members such an important matter that it is not part of your job? Why didn't you "attend" to it for several months?

    他们为什么越权
    河南伊川县从今年一月到四月，发展了新党员467名。这些新党员全部是由中共伊川县委组织部的干事李富方、范光文审批的。本来，按照中共河南省委的指示：“撤区并乡以后发展新党员必须由县委审批”。既然审批新党员的“权”在县委，为什么这两个组织干事竟敢“越俎代庖”呢？原来他们是“奉令而行”“身不由己”！当县委强调“工作忙，顾不上”，而把审批新党员的权限“授”给组织部，组织部长李世芳又把这一权限“授”给他们的时候，他们曾经提出这种做法违背了上级党委指示的精神，恐怕不妥的意见，而县委组织部长李世芳却说：“你们不能光听他们说。”我们不懂，身为县委组织部长的李世芳不听他们——上级党委说究竟要听谁说？我们也要问问中共伊川县委，你们说“工作忙，顾不上”，难道审批新党员这样重要的事就不是你们份内的工作吗？为什么几个月都不“顾”一“顾”呢？
