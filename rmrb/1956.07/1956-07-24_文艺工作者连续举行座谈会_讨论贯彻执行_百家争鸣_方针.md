    Literary and Art Workers Hold Successive Symposiums
    Discuss Implementing the "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom" Policy
    (By our reporter) Beijing. Literary and art workers in Beijing have recently held several symposiums to discuss how to implement the "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom, Let a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend" policy in their creative and theoretical work.
    Painters, sculptors, and arts and crafts artists criticized the leadership in the art world at the symposium for their erroneous thinking of belittling national heritage, especially traditional Chinese painting. The old painter Yu Feian said: To inherit and promote the national heritage, we must first do a good job in theoretical publicity, so that our painters and the masses can understand what the great tradition of Chinese national painting art is. Both old and new painters expressed their delight at the new progress and new achievements of Chinese painters shown at the Second National Chinese Painting Exhibition.
    The symposium in the drama circles mainly discussed the issue of inheriting and promoting national heritage. The old dramatist Bai Yunsheng believes that in the drama circles, everyone talks about Stanislavski, while actors and directors are ignorant of the heritage of Chinese classical drama and blindly belittle it, which is an abnormal phenomenon. He advocated that opera and drama actors should seriously learn from the performance methods of Chinese classical drama, especially facial and eye expressions; on this basis, they should absorb nutrients from the achievements of foreign dramas.
    Musicians and poets exchanged opinions extensively at the symposium on topics such as themes, creative methods, and how to go deep into life to promote creative prosperity. Writers, poets, theorists, and young literary and art workers put forward many criticisms regarding the editorial work of publications such as "Beijing Literature and Art." They demanded that literary and art publications discuss and improve their editorial work in accordance with the "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom, Let a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend" policy.
    Many participants believed that the symposium was also a good place for "contention." The Beijing Federation of Literary and Art Circles is preparing to continue organizing some small-scale symposiums in the near future to further delve into discussions on how to implement the "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom, Let a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend" policy.

    文艺工作者连续举行座谈会
    讨论贯彻执行“百家争鸣”方针
    本报讯　北京市文艺工作者最近举行了好多次座谈会，讨论怎样在创作和理论工作中贯彻“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的方针。
    画家、雕刻家和工艺美术家们在座谈会上批评了美术界领导方面轻视民族遗产，特别是轻视国画的错误思想。老画家于非暗说：要继承和发扬民族遗产，先得做好理论宣传工作，要让我们的画家和人民群众懂得，究竟什么是我国民族绘画艺术的伟大传统。新老画家们对于第二届全国国画展览会上表现出来的国画家们的新的进步、新的成就表示欣喜。
    戏剧界的座谈会主要也讨论了继承和发扬民族遗产问题。老戏剧家白云生认为，目前在戏剧界，言必称史坦尼斯拉夫斯基，而演员、导演对于我国古典戏剧的遗产却盲无所知，一味轻视，这是一种不正常的现象。他主张歌剧和话剧演员应当认真向中国古典戏剧的表演方法学习，特别是脸上和眼神的戏；在这个基础上，再从外国戏剧的成就中吸取养料。
    音乐家和诗人们在座谈会上就题材、创作方法、怎样深入生活繁荣创作等问题，广泛交换了意见。作家、诗人、理论工作者和青年文艺工作者，对于“北京文艺”等刊物的编辑工作，提出了许多批评。他们要求文艺刊物本着“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的方针，讨论和改进编辑工作。
    许多会议参加者认为，座谈会也是“争鸣”的好场所。北京市文学艺术工作者联合会准备在最近期间继续组织一些小型的座谈会，就怎样贯彻“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的方针进一步深入地展开讨论。
