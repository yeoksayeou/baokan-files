    Promoting German Reunification, Developing Peaceful Construction
    East German Government Decides to Disarm 30,000 Troops
    German Socialist Unity Party Suggests Discussing Disarmament and Other Issues with West German Social Democratic Party
    Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, July 1st: According to an announcement by the Press Office of the Prime Minister of the German Democratic Republic on the evening of June 30th: The Council of Ministers of the German Democratic Republic has decided to reduce the army by 30,000 troops.
    The Council of Ministers’ decision on disarmament states that, due to the easing of tensions in international relations, the issue of disarmament, as the most important task in guaranteeing and consolidating peace, has been given top priority. The revival of German militarism in West Germany is contrary to this development in easing tensions. The East German government believes that the two Germanys must negotiate on issues such as reducing the number of troops, prohibiting the storage of atomic weapons on German soil, and not implementing compulsory military service, so that Germany can contribute to the cause of defending peace. Such peaceful actions would also help Germany restore reunification on a democratic basis.
    The Council of Ministers of the German Democratic Republic, in line with its responsibility to the people of all European countries, and in an effort to promote an agreement between the two Germanys, has decided:
    1. To reduce 30,000 troops from the originally established 120,000-strong National People's Army.
    2. To maintain a National People's Army with a total strength of 90,000 troops.
    3. To use the material resources and financial funds freed up by the reduction of the National People's Army for peaceful construction in the national economy.
    4. Replenishment of the National People's Army will be achieved through the recruitment of volunteers.
    5. The Minister of National Defense will issue the necessary orders and instructions to implement this decision.
    Xinhua News Agency, July 1st: According to a TASS dispatch from Berlin on the 1st: The Central Committee of the German Socialist Unity Party has written to the Central Committee of the German Social Democratic Party, suggesting that the two parties jointly discuss the issue of implementing disarmament and abolishing compulsory military service in the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany.
    The letter welcomes the statement issued by the leadership of the German Social Democratic Party against the implementation of compulsory military service in West Germany and against the Federal Republic's participation in military blocs, and points out that, in order to ease tensions within Germany, mutual understanding between the German workers' parties and between German trade unions is very necessary.

    促进德国统一  发展和平建设
    民主德国政府决定裁军三万人
    德国统一社会党建议同西德社会民主党讨论裁军等问题
    新华社柏林1日电　据德意志民主共和国总理新闻处在六月三十日晚间宣布：德意志民主共和国部长会议已经决定裁减军队三万人。
    部长会议通过的关于裁军的决定说，由于国际关系方面紧张状态的缓和，作为保证和巩固和平方面最重要的任务的裁军问题已经被提到首要的地位。而德国军国主义在西德的复活是同在缓和紧张局势方面的这种发展相抵触的。民主德国政府认为，两个德国必须就缩减军队人数、禁止在德国土地上储存原子武器、不实行义务兵役制等问题进行谈判，从而使德国方面对保卫和平事业作出贡献。这种和平的行动也会有助于德国在民主基础上恢复统一。
    民主德国部长会议本着自己对于欧洲各国人民所负有的责任，为了努力促进两个德国之间达成协议，决定：
    1．从原编制的十二万国家人民军中裁减三万人。
    2．保持一支总数为九万人的国家人民军。
    3．把由于裁减国家人民军而抽出来的物质材料和财政资金用于国民经济中的和平建设。
    4．国家人民军的补充将通过招募志愿兵的办法来实现。
    5．国防部长将发布必要的命令和指示来实现这一决定。
    据新华社1日讯　据塔斯社柏林一日讯：德国统一社会党中央委员会写信给德国社会民主党中央委员会，建议两党共同讨论在德意志民主共和国和德意志联邦共和国实行裁军和取消义务兵役制的问题。
    这封信表示欢迎德国社会民主党领导机构发表的反对在西德实行义务兵役制和反对联邦共和国参加军事集团的声明，并且指出，为了缓和德国内部的紧张局势，德国工人政党之间和德国工会之间的相互谅解是非常必要的。
