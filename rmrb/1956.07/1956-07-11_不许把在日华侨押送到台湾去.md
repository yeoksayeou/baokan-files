According to Tokyo news, the Japanese government has decided to begin on July 10th to escort the sixty Chinese nationals detained at the Hamamatsu "Reception Center" of the Japan Ministry of Justice's Immigration Bureau to Taiwan in batches.

This is not the first time that the Japanese government has escorted overseas Chinese in Japan to Taiwan. Last November, the Japanese government colluded with the Chiang Kai-shek clique, using violence to forcibly send 120 overseas Chinese detained in the Hamamatsu "Reception Center" to Taiwan, and cruelly persecuted those overseas Chinese who refused to go to Taiwan, creating the notorious "Hamamatsu Incident." At the time, Japanese Foreign Minister Mamoru Shigemitsu attempted to portray this forced repatriation as being carried out according to the "free will" of the overseas Chinese. However, the Chiang Kai-shek clique's "Central News Agency" admitted that the Japanese government had reached an agreement with the Chiang Kai-shek clique in advance. The Associated Press also did not hesitate to say that "it was the Japanese government that insisted on sending Chinese residents in Japan to Taiwan."

The "Hamamatsu Incident" aroused strong protests from the Chinese and Japanese people. However, only a few months later, the Japanese government forcibly repatriated Chinese nationals to Taiwan again. The Japanese government's unreasonable behavior cannot but arouse our great indignation.

The Japanese government's collusion with the Chiang Kai-shek clique to force overseas Chinese in Japan to go to Taiwan against their will is, in essence, an extremely unfriendly act of interference in China's internal affairs. At a time when the international situation is definitely trending towards detente, and improving relations with China has become the urgent demand of the broad masses of the Japanese people, the Japanese government's actions cannot but make people suspect that its purpose is to create new obstacles to the normalization of Sino-Japanese relations.

It should be pointed out that the legitimate rights and interests of the tens of thousands of Chinese nationals in Japan have not yet received due consideration, their ties with their motherland and families are obstructed, and there is no convenience for returning to the country. However, the Chinese government, regardless of what kind of government Japan has now, has always protected the legitimate rights and interests of Japanese residents in China, and has assisted nearly 30,000 Japanese residents in returning to Japan, and has provided various conveniences for Japanese residents who wish to return home. In contrast, the unreasonableness of the Japanese government's attitude is very obvious.

The Japanese government should realize that the world situation is undergoing major changes, and that continuing to adopt an unfriendly attitude towards the Chinese people is of no benefit. The Japanese government should immediately stop the illegal act of forcibly repatriating overseas Chinese to Taiwan, and implement its repeatedly declared promise to "strive to improve Sino-Japanese relations."

### 不许把在日华侨押送到台湾去

    不许把在日华侨押送到台湾去
    肖光
    据东京消息，日本政府已经决定从七月十日开始，把被拘留在日本法务省出入国境管理局滨松“收容所”里的六十名中国侨民，分批押送去台湾。
    日本政府把在日本的华侨押送到台湾去，这已经不是第一次了。去年十一月，日本政府就曾经勾结蒋介石集团，施用暴力，把被拘禁在滨松“收容所”的一百二十名华侨强制送往台湾，并且对那些拒绝到台湾去的华侨，进行残酷的迫害，造成了有名的“滨松事件”。当时日本外务相重光葵曾经企图把这种强制遣送，说成是按照华侨的“自由意志”进行的。但是蒋介石集团的“中央社”却承认：日本政府同蒋介石集团事先曾经达成协议。连合众社也不讳言“是日本政府硬要把中国的旅日侨民送往台湾去的”。
    “滨松事件”曾经引起了中国人民和日本人民的强烈抗议。但是隔了不过几个月，日本政府竟又把中国侨民强迫遣往台湾。日本政府这种无理行为，不能不激起我们的极大愤慨。
    日本政府勾结蒋介石集团，强迫在日本的华侨违反他们的意愿到台湾去，这实质上是一种干涉中国内政的极不友好的行为。在目前国际局势肯定趋向和缓，改善同中国的关系已经成为广大日本人民的迫切要求的时候，日本政府采取这种行动，不能不使人怀疑它的目的是想给中日关系的正常化制造新的障碍。
    应当指出，中国在日本的数万侨民，他们的正当权益直到现在还得不到应有的照顾，他们同祖国和家庭的联系受到阻挠，更没有回国的便利。而中国政府却不问日本现在有怎样的政府，一向保护在华日本侨民的正当权益，并且已协助将近三万名日本侨民回到了日本，而对愿意回国的日本侨民还给予各种便利。相形之下，日本政府态度的无理是非常明显的。
    日本政府应当认识到，世界局势正在发生重大的变化，继续对中国人民采取不友好的态度是没有任何好处的。日本政府应当立即停止强迫遣送华侨到台湾去的非法行为，把它一再宣布过的要“为改善中日关系而努力”的诺言付诸实现。
