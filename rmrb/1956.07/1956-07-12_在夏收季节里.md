    During the Summer Harvest Season
    Over a Thousand Young Farmers Report Good News
    Xinhua News Agency, 10th. The Communist Youth League Fujian Longxi Local Work Committee sent a telegram to the Communist Youth League Central Committee on the 9th reporting good news: The early rice yield of more than a thousand youth production teams in the Longxi Special District generally exceeded the contracted production targets and broke the local historical record.
    The Zhao'an County Zhaoliang Agricultural Cooperative youth production team harvested 1,120 jin of dry rice per mu of "Nante No. 1," which is currently the highest yield record for early rice harvested in the province. This team also obtained an average of 1,009 jin and 5 liang of dry rice per mu in another two mu of high-yield fields. The youth production team of the Bangshan Township Agricultural Cooperative in Longxi County harvested an average yield of 1,080 jin and a half per mu on 3.08 mu of high-yield fields. The area of these high-yield fields has been investigated and confirmed by the Agricultural Bureau of the County People's Committee and the County Committee of the Communist Youth League. Representatives from agricultural cooperatives in various places or township party branches and agricultural cooperative leaders supervised the harvest, and the rice was dried and stored separately.
    On the same day that the Communist Youth League Central Committee received this telegram of good news, it immediately replied to the rural youth production teams in the Longxi Special District, warmly congratulating them, and requested that rural organizations across the country immediately relay this message to all members of the Communist Youth League and young people. They also called on young people to use all their strength to strive for a bumper agricultural harvest this year.
    Welcoming the First Bumper Harvest
    Xinhua News Agency. In the Bomi area of the Tibetan Plateau, which has a warm climate, the barley in the first military farm has already been filled, and the peas are podding. The soldiers engaged in agricultural production are busy leveling the threshing ground and repairing vehicles and sharpening sickles to welcome the first harvest season. Wheat, barley, peas, and other crops are expected to have a bumper harvest.
    The site of this farm was originally a wasteland. This spring, the soldiers cut down the thorns and weeds, and used tractors and hoes to reclaim the land and sow 7,000 mu of crops.
    Newly Planted Early Japonica Rice Drooping and Shedding Grains
    Xinhua News Agency. Some of the 400,000 mu of early japonica rice promoted in Hubei Province this year are filling, and some are already drooping and shedding grains. In another six or seven days, a large amount can be harvested.
    According to estimates from counties such as Xishui, Hanchuan, Echeng, and Mianyang, the yield of early japonica rice per mu can reach 400 jin. The yield of about 100,000 mu of early japonica rice planted in Xinzhou and Huangpi counties may be even higher. Among them, a type of early japonica rice called "Aomori No. 5" introduced from Jilin Province once experienced abnormal phenomena such as early bolting and heading. After the local agricultural departments promptly led farmers to take remedial measures such as increasing fertilizer application, diligent weeding, and shallow irrigation, the growth situation has generally improved. These days, mass visits and evaluations of early japonica rice are being carried out in various places. People who originally had doubts changed their views when they saw the current scene of a bumper harvest, and they summarized the experience and lessons learned from planting early japonica this year, preparing to expand the planting area of japonica rice next year.
    Cut and Transport as it Ripens
    Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi, 10th. The more than 9 million mu of wheat in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region are ripening one after another from south to north, and farmers of all ethnic groups are carrying out harvesting in succession.
    Because agricultural production cooperatives in various places advanced the planting period and increased the amount of sowing, this year's wheat generally grows with dense plants, large ears, and full grains. The counties in the Tarim Basin can generally increase production by 10% to 20%. This year, the Ili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture has had favorable weather, and hundreds of thousands of mu of dryland wheat will have a bumper harvest. It is estimated that the average yield per mu is 300 jin.
    This year, most agricultural cooperatives organized labor to harvest according to the order of wheat ripening, achieving cutting and transport as it ripens, shortening the harvest time compared to previous years. Farmers in many counties in southern Xinjiang have also prepared a large number of wooden rollers and stone rollers for threshing, changing the previous situation of using livestock to tread the ground, reducing losses.

    在夏收季节里
    一千多个青年农民报捷
    新华社10日讯　青年团福建龙溪地方工作委员会在九日向青年团中央委员会专电报捷：龙溪专区农村一千多个青年生产队的早稻产量，一般都超过了包产任务，突破当地历史上的最高纪录。
    诏安县照亮社青年生产队的一亩“南特号”收干谷一千一百二十斤，为目前全省已收割的早稻的最高丰产纪录。这个队在另外的两亩丰产田里也获得每亩平均一千零九斤五两的干谷。龙溪县榜山乡农业社青年生产队收割的三点零八亩丰产田平均产量为一千零八十斤半。这些丰产田的面积都经过县人民委员会农业局、团县委调查证实，收割时由各地农业社派代表或乡党支部、农业社负责监收，进行单晒单藏。
    青年团中央委员会在收到这个专电捷报的当天，立刻复信给龙溪专区的农村青年生产队，热烈地向他们祝贺，并且要求全国各地农村组织把这个消息立即转告全体团员和青年们，同时号召青年们用一切力量争取今年农业丰收。
    迎接第一个丰收
    据新华社讯　西藏高原气候温暖的波密地区，第一个军营农场里的青稞已经灌浆，豌豆正在结荚。从事农业生产的士兵们正忙着平整打谷场和修车磨镰，迎接头一个收获季节。预计小麦、青稞、豌豆等都可丰收。
    这个农场的场地原来是一片荒地，今年春天，士兵们砍去了这里的荆棘，割掉了野草，用拖拉机和洋镐开垦出了田地，播种了七千亩作物。
    新种早粳稻垂穗散粒
    据新华社讯　湖北省今年推广的四十多万亩早粳稻有的正在灌浆有的已经垂穗散粒，再过六七天就能大量收割。
    据浠水、汉川、鄂城、沔阳等县估计，早粳稻每亩的产量可达到四百斤。新洲、黄陂两个县播种的十万亩左右早粳产量可能更高。其中有一种从吉林省引进的“青森五号”早粳稻曾发生过早打苞抽穗的不正常现象，经过当地农业部门及时领导农民采取增施肥料、勤薅草和浅灌水等办法补救后，现在生长情况普遍好转了。这几天，群众性的参观评比早粳活动正在各地展开，原来有怀疑的人看到目前一片丰收景象时，都改变了自己的看法，纷纷总结今年种植早粳的经验教训，准备明年扩大粳稻的播种面积。
    随黄随割随运
    新华社乌鲁木齐10日电　新疆维吾尔自治区九百多万亩小麦从南而北陆续黄熟，各族农民正先后紧张地展开收割。
    由于各地农业生产合作社提早了播种期，并增加了播种量，今年小麦普遍长得株密穗大，颗粒饱满。塔里木盆地各县普遍可增产一成到二成。伊犁哈萨克族自治州今年风调雨顺，数十万亩旱田小麦都将获得丰收，估计平均每亩产量有三百斤。
    今年大部农业社都按麦熟先后，组织劳动力进行收割，作到随黄随割、随拉运，收割时间比往年缩短。新疆南部许多县的农民还准备了大批木磙和石磙碾场，改变了以往用牲畜踏场的情况，减少了损失。
