Random Thoughts on Sketching in Xiang and Guangxi (Part 2)
    On the Road to Yangshuo
    Hu Peiheng
    From "Guilin's scenery is the best under heaven," I thought of "Yangshuo's scenery is the best in Guilin," so I went to Yangshuo to sketch. I boarded the boat at the Liberation Bridge pier in Guilin. Before the boat set sail, I sat on the boat and started drawing Fubo Hill, Rooster Fighting Hill, and Pierced Hole Hill with a brush. After the boat set sail, I continued to draw Dabaoshan, Xiaobaotan, Guancaitan, and other scenery. The ancients described Guilin with the verse "The water is like a green silk ribbon, and the mountains are like jade hairpins," but this is not quite appropriate. Sun Yun's "Casual Talks with Leftover Ink" says: "The beauty of Guilin's caves and the steepness of its peaks are beyond description in a thousand words, and the changes in Yangshuo's scenery are the most extreme. In the boat, I occasionally came up with the line 'Good mountains allow people to look at all four sides.'" I think this poem makes a lot of sense. When I was sketching on the boat, I really looked left and right, at all four sides, but I was even more overwhelmed. This kind of scenery has many similarities to the strange peaks and rocks painted by Shitao. Since Da Dizi was born in Guangxi (see Zhang Xianghe's "Notes from Western Guangdong"), he naturally first wrote about the famous mountains in various places in Guangxi. Therefore, the hundreds of miles of mountains and rivers of the Li River became his painting materials (Shitao often used the seal "Search all strange peaks to make rough drafts"). Therefore, Shitao's landscape artistic conception is novel and has a basis; it is a realistic work.
    We are very familiar with the saying "Guilin's scenery is the best under heaven, Yangshuo's scenery is the best in Guilin, and the best scenery in Yangshuo is in Xingping." On the third day of the boat trip, we arrived in Xingping. The mountains in Xingping are particularly tall and deeply beautiful. Because the water is deep, it is particularly green, and there are many large bamboo forests on the shore, stretching as far as the eye can see, making it even more serene. Xingping Township has the beauty of pavilions, terraces, flowers, and trees, coupled with the accompaniment of green mountains and rivers, which is truly rare, no wonder everyone praises it. I asked the boat to stop by the shore, and I went ashore to paint. "Casual Talks with Leftover Ink" says: "The mountains here are so strange and steep that even the sand and stones are all good." I picked up a stone weighing two pounds, with dark green moss, shaped like the head of Kui Xing in opera, with complete ears, eyes, mouth, and nose. I have brought this stone back as a souvenir.

    湘桂写生随感之二
    阳朔道中
    胡佩衡
    从“桂林山水甲天下”，联想到“阳朔山水甲桂林”，于是赴阳朔写生。在桂林解放桥码头上船，未开船时，我就坐在船上用毛笔开始画伏波山、斗鸡山、穿孔山，开船后，又接着画大宝山、小宝滩、官彩滩等景。古人描写桂林有“水似青罗带，山如碧玉簪”的诗句，其实还不够恰当。孙橒“余墨偶谈”载：“桂林岩洞之美，峰峦之峭，欲状其形势，非千百言所能罄，而阳朔山水变化尤为之最。在舟中偶得‘山好容人四面看’之句。”我觉得这句诗倒很有道理，我在船上写生，真是左顾右盼，四面都看，但也更是应接不暇了。这种风景对照石涛所画的奇峰怪石，是多有吻合的地方。由于大涤子生于广西（见张祥河“粤西笔述”），当然先写广西各地方的名山，所以，漓江数百里的山水，都成了他作画的素材（石涛常用“搜尽奇峰打草稿”的图章）。因此，石涛山水意境新奇，是有依据的，是现实主义的作品。
    “桂林山水甲天下，阳朔山水甲桂林，阳朔美景在兴坪”的话，我们是听熟了的。船行第三天，到了兴坪。兴坪的山特别的高大，而且深秀。因为水深，故特别的绿，岸上多大竹林，一望无边，更显得十分清幽。兴坪乡，有亭台花木之胜，再加上青山绿水相陪衬，真是难得，无怪人人称道。叫船停在岸旁，我上岸画了起来。“余墨偶谈”中说：“此地山既奇峭，虽砂石亦无不佳”，我拾得一块石头子，有二斤重，苔斑浓绿，形似戏剧中魁星的头，耳目口鼻俱全。我已将这块石头子带回来，作为纪念。（附图片）
