Big Restaurants Supply Breakfast
    (By our newspaper) It is reported that big restaurants in the bustling Qianmen district of Beijing, such as "Sanlihe Cafeteria," "Huabei Restaurant," "Muslim Restaurant," "Qingsongyuan," and "Xinfengyuan," have all started serving breakfast. The breakfast stalls that already existed have also increased the amount of breakfast they prepare.
    The Qianmen District Catering Company Management Office will use electric stone mills to grind soybean milk, which will increase the supply by more than double and improve the quality. In addition, they will also implement a delivery service for some government agencies and schools.
