Important Contributions of Agricultural Scientists in East China
——An Introduction to the Cultivation of Several High-Grade Fine Yarn Raw Material Long-Staple Cotton
Shi Yue'e
Researchers at the East China Institute of Agricultural Science, applying Michurin's theories, have successfully cultivated China's finest new cotton varieties—"Long-Staple No. 1," "Long-Staple No. 2," and "Long-Staple No. 3"—after several years of effort. After trial spinning, these three types of long-staple cotton can spin high-grade fine yarns of 60 counts to over 100 counts. The development of long-staple cotton is of great significance to the development of China's fine yarn textile industry. The finest linen we usually wear is below 80 counts, while "Long-Staple No. 1" and "Long-Staple No. 3" can both spin fine yarns above 100 counts, and "Long-Staple No. 2" can also spin fine yarns above 60 counts.

The birth of long-staple cotton is an important contribution of agricultural scientific research workers in East China to China's socialist construction.

Continuous single-plant directional cultivation is one of the main methods in Michurin's biological theory for selecting fine varieties. "Long-Staple No. 1" cotton was cultivated using this method. In the winter of 1950, a comrade from the Institute of Agricultural Science brought several seeds of "Dezi" long-staple cotton from the D渡口 (D渡口) Cotton Farm in Anhui. The cotton harvested from cultivation in 1951 had an average staple length of 36.33 mm. The staff of the Institute of Agricultural Science conducted single-plant selection with the goal of fine and long fibers. By 1955, the average staple length had reached 38 mm, with the longest reaching 46.8 mm. Now, the offspring of these "Dezi" cotton seeds have been named "Long-Staple No. 1" and have been propagated on a large area of land.

Conducting "distant hybridization" can yield cotton plants with economic value. However, the Sino-American cotton hybridization conducted by the Kuomintang's Central Agricultural Research Institute in the past, because it was conducted under the guidance of gene theory to study gene transfer, was considered to have no practical value. After the East China Institute of Agricultural Science took over this institution, it studied Michurin's theory, used the original materials, and engaged in breeding and selection, selecting and breeding a new variety "Long-Staple No. 2" with economic value. In 1955, the average staple length of this long-staple cotton was 32.7 mm, and some cotton plants had a staple length of 38.2 mm, and had disease resistance and early maturity properties. This forcefully refuted the idea that interspecific hybrid offspring had no application value.

Sea Island cotton, with fibers as fine and long as silk, is an excellent cotton variety. It has a long growing period and is suitable for growing in arid areas with irrigation conditions. When Sea Island cotton grows in China's main cotton-producing areas, the cotton plants bloom very late, and the initial flower buds easily fall off, resulting in very low yields. Therefore, some people believe that it cannot grow in the Yangtze River Basin. The scientific workers of the Institute of Agricultural Science successfully applied Michurin's principle of "asexual hybridization shaking heredity" to cotton selection and creatively cultivated the excellent new variety "Long-Staple No. 3" (Sea Island cotton). They grafted Sea Island cotton with various upland cottons, using the nutrients synthesized by early-maturing upland cotton to cultivate Sea Island cotton seeds. In 1950, Sea Island cotton was grafted onto "Daizi" cotton, a type of upland cotton. The branches of the Sea Island cotton grafts began to bloom on August 26, which was indeed about a month earlier than the flowering period of ungrafted Sea Island cotton. Since 1953, they have carried out directional cultivation of Sea Island cotton for early maturity and long staple. The maturity period of Sea Island cotton has been advanced every year, and the yield has also increased year by year. In 1955, the Sea Island cotton planted in the East China Institute of Agricultural Science yielded more than 220 jin of seed cotton per mu, with fiber lengths generally above 40 mm, and the longest reaching 52 mm. This shows that the principle of asexual hybridization has the same value as sexual hybridization in application, opening up a new path for cotton breeding work. This "Long-Staple No. 3", which was successfully cultivated through multiple breeding selections, can be cultivated in the Yangtze River Basin or even larger areas of China.

The successful cultivation of long-staple cotton is the result of arduous research by scientific researchers at the East China Institute of Agricultural Science. To influence the early-maturing characteristics of upland cotton on Sea Island cotton and change the late-maturing characteristics of Sea Island cotton, they grafted Sea Island cotton with upland cotton. In 1950, due to their insufficient skill in cleft grafting techniques, only five out of one hundred plants could be successfully grafted. When Sea Island cotton seeds are scarce, fewer successful grafts will affect the development of breeding work. Therefore, they changed the cleft grafting method to approach grafting, so that more than 90% of Sea Island cotton could be successfully grafted, ensuring the smooth progress of Sea Island cotton breeding work, thus obtaining the superior variety "Long-Staple No. 3." In the past, some scientific research workers, when conducting interspecific hybridization between Chinese cotton and upland cotton, often crossed tens of thousands of cotton flowers, and could only occasionally obtain a few seeds. In 1954, researchers at the Institute of Agricultural Science used repeated pollination to reduce cotton shedding, but only obtained two seeds. In order to create new cotton varieties, it is necessary to overcome the infertility of distant hybridization and normalize the physiology of interspecific hybrids. They applied sucrose solution mixed with vitamin B, smeared it on the stigma of the cotton flower and then pollinated, promoting pollen germination. At the same time, they mixed "2,4-D" in lanolin and applied it to the pedicel of the pollinated cotton flower to prevent cotton boll shedding. As a result, the boll setting rate of cotton increased from 0.02% or 0.03% in the past to 3% to 9%, obtaining more seeds. This creative experiment shows that the high infertility of "distant hybridization" can be overcome, which provides good conditions for us to create new plant varieties by applying "distant hybridization" in the future.

In order to meet the country's needs for high-quality long-staple cotton more quickly, the East China Institute of Agricultural Science, according to the instructions of the Ministry of Agriculture, has conducted comparative experiments of "Long-Staple No. 1" and "Long-Staple No. 2" in China's major cotton-producing areas in the past two years. In 1954, "Long-Staple No. 1" was tested in seven places including Nanjing, Yuncheng, and Turpan, and the average staple length of cotton produced in the breeding fields was 38.71 mm.

Note: In plant taxonomy, cotton belongs to the "Gossypium" genus, and the "genus" is divided into different "species," and the "species" has different varieties. There are four "species" of cultivated cotton in the world, namely upland cotton, Sea Island cotton, Indian cotton, and African cotton.

The so-called "foreign cotton" most commonly cultivated in China, such as S cotton, Dai cotton, 108F... etc., are all different varieties of upland cotton. The "Long-Staple No. 3" cotton variety selected and bred by the East China Institute of Agricultural Science belongs to Sea Island cotton. Kapok in Yunnan is also a perennial Sea Island cotton. "Chinese cotton" or "native cotton," which has been cultivated in China for a long time, belongs to Indian cotton. "Xiaomian" or "Caomian", sporadically cultivated in Xinjiang and Gansu, belongs to African cotton. Upland cotton and Sea Island cotton have great differences in morphology. The quality of upland cotton is suitable for general textile use; Sea Island cotton has fine and long fibers, which is the best quality cotton and is suitable for spinning high-grade fine yarns.

Hybridizing cotton whose parents belong to different "species" and "genus" is called "distant hybridization." This "distant hybridization" is relatively difficult because the biological characteristics of the parents are very different. Hybridizing Sea Island cotton with upland cotton, or hybridizing upland cotton with Indian cotton (Chinese cotton), are both considered "distant hybridization."

    华东农业科学工作者的重要贡献
    ——介绍几种高级细纱原料长绒棉的培育经过
    史越峨
    华东农业科学研究所的研究工作者应用米丘林的学说，经过几年来的努力，成功地培育了我国最优良的棉花新品种——“长绒一号”、“长绒二号”和“长绒三号”。经过试纺，这三种长绒棉可以纺六十支到一百支以上的高级细纱。长绒棉的育成，对于我国细纱纺织业的发展，是有重要意义的。我们平时穿的最细麻纱都在八十支以下，而“长绒一号”和“长绒三号”都可以纺一百支以上的细纱，“长绒二号”也可以纺六十支以上的细纱。
    长绒棉的诞生，是华东农业科学研究工作者对我国社会主义建设事业的一个重要贡献。
    连续单株定向培育方法，是米丘林生物学说中关于选择良种的主要方法之一。“长绒一号”棉花就是采用这个方法培育出来的。1950年冬天农业科学研究所的一位同志从安徽大渡口棉场带来了几粒“德字”长绒棉种籽，经1951年栽培收获的棉花，平均绒长36.33毫米。农业科学研究所的工作人员以纤维细长为目标进行单株选种，到1955年平均绒长已经达到38毫米，最长的达到46.8毫米。现在这几株“德字”棉种的后代已经被命名为“长绒一号”，而且已经在大面积土地上繁殖。
    进行“远缘杂交”，可以获得具有经济价值的棉株。但是，过去国民党的中央农业研究所进行的中美棉杂交，因为是在基因学说指导下，进行基因转移研究，便被认为没有实用价值。华东农业科学研究所接收这个机构后，在学习米丘林学说的基础上，利用原有材料，从事培育选择，选育了具有经济价值的新品种“长绒二号”。1955年这种长绒棉的平均绒长为32.7毫米，部分棉株绒长达38.2毫米，并且具有抗病、早熟的性能。这就有力地推翻了那种认为种间杂交后代没有应用价值的说法。
    纤维像丝一样细长的海岛棉，是一种优良的棉种，它生育期长，适宜在干旱而有灌溉条件的地区生长。海岛棉在我国主要棉产区生长的时候，棉株开花很迟，初期花蕾很容易脱掉，产量很低。因此有人认为不能在长江流域生长。农业科学研究所的科学工作者把米丘林的“无性杂交动摇遗传性”的原理，成功地应用在棉花选种上，创造性地培育了优良的“长绒三号”（海岛棉）新品种。他们把海岛棉和各种陆地棉进行嫁接，以早熟的陆地棉合成的营养培育海岛棉子实。1950年海岛棉嫁接在陆地棉中的“岱字”棉上，海岛棉接的枝条在八月二十六日开始开花，果然比没有嫁接的海岛棉的开花期提早一个月左右。1953年以来，他们将海岛棉进行早熟长绒的定向培育，海岛棉的成熟期每年都能提早，产量也逐年提高。1955年在华东农业科学研究所内种植的海岛棉每亩收籽棉二百二十多斤，纤维长度一般在四十毫米以上，最长的达到五十二毫米。这说明了无性杂交的原理在应用上和有性杂交有同样价值，为棉花选育工作开辟了一条新途径。这种经过多次培育选择而培育成功的“长绒三号”，可以在我国长江流域或更加广大的地区栽培。
    长绒棉的培育成功，是华东农业科学研究所的科学研究工作者艰苦钻研的结果。要以陆地棉早熟的特性影响海岛棉，改变海岛棉迟熟的特性，他们就把海岛棉和陆地棉进行嫁接。1950年由于他们劈接技术不够熟练，一百株中只能接活五株。在海岛棉种籽稀少的情况下，嫁接成活少了，就会影响培育工作的开展。于是，他们把用劈接法改成靠接法，使海岛棉有90％以上能接活，保证了海岛棉选育工作的顺利进行，因而取得了“长绒三号”的良种。过去有的科学研究工作者在进行中棉和陆地棉种间杂交的时候，往往交配了上万朵棉花，只能偶然得到几粒种籽。1954年农业科学研究所的研究工作者采用重复授粉法减少棉花脱落，但是也仅获得二粒种籽。为了创造棉花新品种，必须克服远缘杂交的不孕性，使种间杂交种生理正常化。他们应用蔗糖溶液混入维生素乙，涂在棉花的柱头上再授粉，促进花粉的发芽，同时用“二四滴”混在羊毛脂中，涂在授粉棉花的花柄上，防止棉铃脱落，于是，棉花的结铃率从过去的万分之二或三提高到百分之三到九，获得了较多的种籽。这一创造性的试验说明了“远缘杂交”的高度不孕性是可以克服的，这对我们今后应用“远缘杂交”创造植物新品种提供了很好的条件。
    为了更快地满足国家对品质优良的长绒棉的需要，华东农业科学研究所根据农业部的指示，近两年来已经把“长绒一号”、“长绒二号”分别在我国主要棉产区进行对比试验。1954年，“长绒一号”经南京、运城、吐鲁番等七个地方的试验，繁殖田所产棉花的平均绒长为38.71毫米。
    附注：在植物分类学上，棉花属于“棉属”，“属”下面分成不同的“种”，“种”里面又有不同的品种。世界上栽培的棉花共分四个“种”，即陆地棉、海岛棉、印度棉和非洲棉。
    我国目前栽培最普遍的所谓“洋棉”，如斯字棉、岱字棉、108夫……等都是陆地棉中的不同品种。华东农业科学研究所所选育的“长绒三号”棉种，属于海岛棉，云南一带的木棉，也是一种多年生的海岛棉。我国历史上曾长期栽培的“中棉”或“土棉”，属印度棉。新疆、甘肃一带零星栽培的“小棉”或“草棉”，属非洲棉。陆地棉和海岛棉在形态上有很大的区别。陆地棉的品质适合于一般纺织用；海岛棉纤维细而长，是品质最好的棉花，适合于纺高级细纱。
    把父母本属于不同的“种”和“属”的棉花进行杂交，叫做“远缘杂交”，这种“远缘杂交”因为父母本的生物学特性差异很大，所以比较困难。用海岛棉和陆地棉进行杂交，或用陆地棉印度棉（中棉）杂交，都属“远缘杂交”。
