Voices of the Masses

    Don't "Judge People and Serve Dishes Accordingly"

    In Hulan County, Heilongjiang Province, one often hears cadres lamenting: finding a place to live is harder than climbing to heaven. Because they can't find housing, the wife of Comrade Wang Kui from the Grain Bureau has been squeezed into the office ever since she came from Shanxi this spring; some cadres' family members have had to borrow space from relatives. Is it that Hulan County has too few houses to meet the demand? No, the problem is who is "requesting" them. For example, Gao Xiuzhang, the former secretary of the Taitun District Party Committee, found a house soon after being transferred to the Organization Department of the Hulan County Party Committee; and later, he moved again because he found it too far away. Sun, the section chief of the County People's Committee Health Section, also moved to a place closer to work because his house was far away, and the house was very nice.

    I can't understand why the Hulan County Housing Management Office has to "judge people and serve dishes accordingly," being "responsive to every request" for some people and "unresponsive to any request" for others? (Xiao Guang)

    Let Technical Cadres Focus on Their Expertise

    I am a medical worker in a medium-sized city. Since I started working, I have been transferred to participate in the central tasks of the state every year. For example, in 1953, I worked on unified purchase and sales for three months, in 1954, I worked on the general election for two months, and in 1955, I worked on grain rationing for half a year, followed by the anti-reactionary campaign. This has seriously affected my study and research in my own field. I hope that the leadership will not pull too many technical cadres to do administrative work. (Zhang Xinmin)

    Caring for Rabbits or Caring for People?

    In Gaomi County, Shandong Province, the offices and cadre dormitories of some organs have been leaking when it rains for a long time due to a lack of repair, which affects the work and rest of the cadres. However, recently the Gaomi County Party Committee spent forty yuan on repair costs to build a brand-new house for rabbits. This cannot help but make people wonder, what standard does Gaomi County follow for the expenditure of repair funds? Why care so much about rabbits and not care about cadres!
                      (Chu Jinmao)

    Break This Convention

    When we go to factories or organs for internships, we always give them gifts after the internship, such as banners, landscape pictures, plaster statues, etc. This expense is paid from the internship fee. It is said that this has become a convention, the purpose of which is to enhance unity. I think this is a waste and has little to do with so-called enhancing unity. This bad convention should be broken. (Guo Shaoxi)

    群众呼声
    不要“看人下菜碟”
    在黑龙江省呼兰县常常可以听到一些干部慨叹：找房子住比登天还难。因为找不着房子，粮食局王奎同志的爱人今年春天从山西来了以后，只好一直挤在机关里；有的干部的家属，只好借住在亲戚家。是不是呼兰县房子太少，供不应求呢？不是，问题是看谁“求”，比如原苔屯区区委书记高秀章，一调到中共呼兰县委组织部不久，就找到了房子住；而且后来他嫌远又搬了一次家。县人民委员会卫生科孙科长也因为房子远，很快就搬到近的地方，而且房子还很漂亮。
    我想不通，呼兰县房产管理处，为什么要“看人下菜碟”，对一些人是“有求必应”，而对另一些人“有求不应”呢？  （晓　光）
    让技术干部多钻研业务
    我是一个中等城市的医务工作者，从参加工作后，每年都被调去参加国家的中心工作。如1953年作了三个月的统购统销工作，1954年又作了两个月的普选工作，1955年作了半年的粮食定量供应工作，紧接着又去作肃反工作。以致严重地影响了我对本身业务的学习和钻研。我希望领导上不要过多拉技术干部去作行政工作。　　（章新民）
    关心兔子还是关心人？
    山东省高密县有些机关的办公室和干部宿舍，因长期没有修缮，一遇雨天就要漏水，以致影响干部的工作和休息。可是最近中共高密县委会却用了四十元的修缮费给兔子修了一所崭新的房子。这不能不令人奇怪，高密县的修缮费究竟是按照什么标准开支的呢？为什么这样关心兔子而不这样关心干部呢！
                      （褚金茂）
    打破这种惯例
    我们到工厂或机关去实习，在实习结束后总要送点礼物给他们，如锦旗、风景图片、石膏像等，这一笔费用由实习费内开支。据说这已成了惯例，目的是为了增强团结。我认为这是一种浪费，和所谓增强团结并没有多少关系。应该打破这种不好的惯例。　　　　（郭绍喜）
