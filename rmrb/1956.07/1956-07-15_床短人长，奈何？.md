    The bed is short, but the person is tall, what to do?
    I am a cadre of the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau, living in the agency's collective dormitory. The bunk beds we sleep on are only 1.8 meters long, but I am 1.83 meters tall. Because the bed is short and the person is tall, it is extremely inconvenient to sleep. If I don't stretch my head out of the bed, I have to put my legs on the bed frame. I and several taller comrades requested the administrative office to issue us some longer single beds, but the administrative staff said, "If you want to sleep in a single bed, you have to wait until you are promoted to the level of section chief." Therefore, we have no choice but to grieve in silence. (Zhuang Guangze)

    床短人长，奈何？
    我是上海市公安局的干部，住在机关集体宿舍，我们睡的二层小铁床，床身只有1.8公尺，但是我的身长却有1.83公尺。由于床短人长，睡觉极不方便，不把头伸到床外，就得把腿放到床架上。我和几个个子高的同志请求行政管理处发给我们几张较长的单人床，但是，行政管理人员却说，要睡单人床，等你们升到科长级才行”。因此，我们只好暗自悲伤。　（庄广泽）
