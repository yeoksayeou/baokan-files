Fresh vegetables from Zhejiang are Continuously Shipped to the Northeast

    (Reported by this newspaper) Summer vegetables produced along the Qiantang River are being continuously transported by train and ship to the Northeast to support the needs of industrial cities. As of June 20th, more than 1.5 million jin of over ten types of vegetables, including tomatoes, green peppers, onions, cabbages, eggplants, and gourds, have been transported to cities such as Shenyang, Dalian, Jiamusi, and Andong.

    These fresh vegetables are organized for transport by the Hangzhou City Supply and Marketing Cooperative. To keep the vegetables fresh during the long journey, the cooperative has worked with the railway transportation department to use refrigerated cars for transportation. In the coming period, hundreds of tons of vegetables will be transported to various industrial cities in the Northeast by ship and refrigerated car. (Hangzhou Daily Editorial Department)

    浙江鲜菜源源运往东北
    本报讯　钱塘江边出产的夏季蔬菜，正由火车和轮船源源运送到东北，支援工业城市的需要。到六月二十日为止，已有蕃茄、青椒、洋葱头、包心菜、红茄和葫芦等十多种蔬菜共一百五十多万斤，运到沈阳、旅大、佳木斯、安东等城市。
    这些鲜嫩的蔬菜，是由杭州市供销合作社组织外运的。为了使蔬菜在长途运输中保持新鲜，这个社已和铁路运输部门研究好用冷藏车来装运。在今后一个时期里，将要用轮船和冷藏车把数百吨蔬菜运到东北各工业城市去。　（杭州日报编辑部）
