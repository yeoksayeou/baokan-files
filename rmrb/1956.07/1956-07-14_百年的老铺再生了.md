    The Century-Old Shop is Reborn
    Fu Dong
    After running around under the sun for several hours, I was desperately thirsty. Suddenly, in the distance, I saw a light green building. It looked like an ice cream shop, so I decided to go and get a soda.
    As I got closer, what? "Xin Yuan Zhai Honey Fruit Shop"? I was stunned when I saw the sign above the entrance to the ice cream shop. When was this sign put up again? This used to be a famous sour plum drink shop with a 120-year history. I heard that the owner hadn't been doing well and had closed it down a few years ago, leasing it to someone who opened an ink factory. Every time I walked past this place, I would remember the refreshing taste of the sour plum drink I used to have here.
    Pushing open the door, I almost didn't recognize it. The tall, bright glass display cases, the clean tables and chairs, the staff in their snow-white uniforms...it certainly wasn't like this before. The space was quite narrow, with only three small tea tables. When there were a few more people wanting to drink the plum beverage, the later arrivals had to stand and drink with their bowls in their hands.
    Has the taste of the plum drink changed? I quickly drank a bowl. This bowl of sweet and sour plum beverage went down like a refreshing medicine, chasing away the heat all over my body and making me feel much lighter.
    At this point, I took a look at the people behind the counter. One person looked familiar. After talking to him, I learned that he was the former shopkeeper, Xiao Guibin. He had only returned from out of town less than a week ago.
    Once we started talking, he had a lot to say! He said that the shop was first opened during the Xianfeng era of the Qing Dynasty. The Xiao family took over the shop during the Guangxu era, by which time it already had a reputation. Recalling the situation at the time, he said: Everyone said it was delicious, and people came from nearby and even from far away. But there just weren't many people. Those who came to eat were mostly princes, eunuchs, and government officials. Later, during the "Republic," those who came were mostly wealthy people. Some ordinary people said that it tasted good, but it was expensive, two or three times more expensive than other shops. So the shop never developed, and eventually it had to close down, and the plaque that had hung for more than a hundred years was turned over and the words "Jian Shan Ink" were written on it. The few sour plum beverage experts either returned to their hometowns to farm the land or became sales clerks in cooperatives. He himself went to a Peking opera troupe in the Northeast and played the snare drum.
    Some time ago, he received a letter saying that Beijing wanted to restore the characteristics of the old food and beverage industry, and the shop would reopen in June. When he rushed back to take a look, it had been completely transformed! The government had gone to great lengths to invite two technicians back, and had spent seven or eight hundred yuan to paint the original house and knock through the four rooms to make one large space. But the ingredients were still sour plums from Anji County in Zhejiang Province, and it still contained rock sugar and sweet osmanthus. The method was also the same as before.
    Xiao Guibin paused here and said: "You tasted it, the taste hasn't changed, has it! But some things have changed that you can't see, and that is that it is much cleaner. Now the government has built a boiler, a steam room, a shower room, a bottle-washing room, and a changing room for our processing plant. In the past, we would just wash the bottles with water, but now, not only are the bottles boiled before filling them with plum drink, but they are also steamed after they are filled."

    百年的老铺再生了
    傅冬
    在太阳底下跑了几个钟头，口干得要命，突然远远地看见一间浅绿色的房子，那大概是个冷食店，我决定去喝一杯汽水。
    走近一看，怎么，“信远斋蜜果店”？当我看到冷食店门口的横匾时，我发楞了。这招牌是什么时候又重新挂上的？本来这儿是有名的有一百二十年历史的酸梅汤老铺，听说老板经营不好，前几年关了门顶给人家开了油墨厂。每次走过这里，我总想起以前在这里喝酸梅汤的清凉味道。
    推开门，简直不认识了。那高大明亮的玻璃橱，洁净的桌椅，穿着雪白的工作服的服务员……早先这儿可不是这样，房子挺窄，只摆着三个小茶几。来喝梅汤的人稍多一点，后来的人，只好端着个碗站着喝。
    梅汤的味儿变了没有？我急忙喝了一碗。这一碗又甜又酸的梅汤喝下去，真像一副清凉剂把我浑身的热气一下子都给赶跑了，身上顿时轻了一大截。
    这时我打量了一下柜台上的人。有个人比较面熟，谈起来，知道他原来就是从前的掌柜的萧桂彬。他才从外地回来不到一个星期。
    一谈，他的话可多啦！他说，这字号在清朝咸丰年间就开了，萧家是在光绪年间接的这铺子，那时已经有了名望。他回忆着当时的情形说：人人都说好吃，来吃的人有近处的，也有从老远的地方特意赶来的。可就是人数不多。吃的人多是王爷、太监，和作官的。以后到了“民国”，来的人也多是有钱的。一些老百姓说，好吃是好吃，就是贵，比别家的贵两、三倍。所以铺子一直没发展，到后来不得不关了门，把挂了一百多年的匾翻过来写上“建山油墨”几个字。那几个作酸梅汤的能手，有的回乡种了地，有的到合作社当了售货员，他自己跑到东北一个京剧团打了小鼓。
    前些日子，他接到一封信说，北京要恢复旧有的饮食业的特点，铺子在六月重新开张了。他赶回来一看，大改样了！政府费了好大的劲把两个技术员请了回来，还花了七、八百元把原来的房子油刷了一遍，四间房子也打通了。可是作料还是用浙江安吉县的酸梅，还是放的冰糖、桂花。作法也照老样。
    萧桂彬说到这里停了停说：“你尝了，味道没走样吧！可是有些地方改了，你们看不到，那就是干净多了。现在政府给我们的加工厂盖了锅炉、蒸汽室、淋浴室、刷瓶室和更衣室。早先瓶子用水刷刷就算不错了，现在瓶子不但装梅汤以前要用水煮，装了以后还要蒸哩。”
