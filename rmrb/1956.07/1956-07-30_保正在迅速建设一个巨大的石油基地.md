    Xinhua News Agency, July 26th: According to a report from the Bulgarian Telegraph Agency: A huge oil industrial base is being rapidly built in Bulgaria.
    This oil-producing area, located near the village of Churenlovo in the county of Balchik, was discovered five years ago. Since oil extraction began in 1954, many facilities have been established here. Exploration work is still underway. From the end of last year to the present, due to the adoption of new technical measures, the maximum daily oil production of some wells has increased to 200 to 250 cubic meters.
    With the increase in oil production, this important raw material is being used more and more widely in industry. Not long ago, Bulgaria was only able to extract four products from oil, but now it is able to extract thirteen main products and more than forty raw materials that can be used by the textile and other industrial sectors.

    保正在迅速建设一个巨大的石油基地
    新华社26日讯　据保加利亚通讯社报道：保加利亚的一个巨大的石油工业基地正在迅速建设中。
    这个位于巴尔西克县丘列诺沃村附近的石油产地是五年以前发现的。从1954年开始采油以来，这里已经建立了许多设备。现在勘探工作仍在进行中。从去年年底到现在，由于采用了新的技术措施，有些油井每昼夜最大的采油量增加到了二百到二百五十立方公尺。
    随着采油量的增加，这一重要原料在工业中得到了日益广泛的使用。还在不久以前，保加利亚只能够从石油中提炼出四种产品，现在它已经能够从石油中提炼出十三种主要产品和四十多种可以供纺织和其他工业部门使用的原料了。
