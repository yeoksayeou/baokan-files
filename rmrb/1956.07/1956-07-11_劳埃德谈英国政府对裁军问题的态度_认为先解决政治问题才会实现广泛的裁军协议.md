Xinhua News Agency, London, July 10th: According to the British Information Service in London: British Foreign Secretary Lloyd, when answering questions on disarmament in the House of Commons on the 9th, said that the British government believes that broad disarmament agreements can only be implemented after outstanding political problems are resolved. He also expressed his inability to accept the proposal to immediately halt hydrogen bomb tests.

He said, "Her Majesty's Government does not require any international problem to be solved before an agreement on a broad disarmament treaty is reached. Indeed, I have always believed that if we can reach an agreement on disarmament, that in itself would help to ease tensions." However, Lloyd believes that there is a distinction between reaching an agreement and implementing an agreement. He said: A broad disarmament agreement will not be achieved unless outstanding political problems are resolved.

Lloyd said: The British government adheres to the disarmament plan proposed by Britain and France on March 19. When Lloyd spoke about the issue of ceasing nuclear weapons tests, he said: "Her Majesty's Government believes that the issue of testing nuclear weapons should be discussed in the Disarmament Committee. The British and French proposals advocate limiting and eventually prohibiting nuclear weapons tests. Her Majesty's Government believes that an agreement on the immediate cessation of hydrogen bomb tests is impossible to reach, impossible to implement, and also not in our country's interests."

    劳埃德谈英国政府对裁军问题的态度
    认为先解决政治问题才会实现广泛的裁军协议
    新华社10日讯　据英国新闻处伦敦消息：英国外交大臣劳埃德九日在下院就裁军问题回答问题的时候说：英国政府认为，要解决悬而未决的政治问题以后，才能执行广泛的裁军协定。他同时表示不能接受立即停止氢弹试验的建议。
    他说，“女王政府并不要求在就一项广泛的裁军协定达成协议以前，必须解决任何国际问题。的确，我一向认为，如果我们能够就裁军问题达成协议，那末，它本身就会有助于缓和紧张局势。”但是，劳埃德认为，在达成协议和执行协定之间有区别。他说：广泛的裁军协议是不会实现的，除非悬而未决的政治问题获得解决。
    劳埃德说：英国政府坚持英法两国在三月十九日提出的裁军计划。劳埃德谈到停止核子武器试验问题的时候说：“女王政府认为，试验核子武器的问题应该在裁军委员会中讨论。英国和法国的建议主张限制并且最后禁止核子武器试验。女王政府认为，关于立即停止氢弹试验的协议，是不可能达成，也不可能执行的；同时，那也是不符合我国的利益的。”
