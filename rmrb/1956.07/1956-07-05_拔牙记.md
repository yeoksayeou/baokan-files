    An Account of a Tooth Extraction
    Bu Xiaozhou
    More than half a month ago, one of my teeth suddenly started to hurt. As the saying goes, "A toothache isn't a disease, but it can kill you when it hurts," and I experienced it firsthand. That troublesome bad tooth tormented me almost the whole night. The next day, I took a half-day off to go to the hospital for treatment, but there were too many patients, and I could only get an "appointment" number. What could I do? Although the toothache made me anxious, my temperature was definitely not above 38 degrees, so I couldn't get "emergency" treatment. I had no choice but to return home, holding my cheek. Fortunately, after two days, the pain gradually lessened. However, I was still worried, because I heard that if dental problems are not treated in time, they may cause lower back pain, bone pain, or even hemiplegia in old age. So, on the day of the "appointment," I still went to the hospital.
    In the hospital, the hot corridor was filled with people waiting for treatment. Many experienced patients brought a book or magazine to read while waiting. I didn't bring any reading material. Fortunately, the health propaganda posters on the wall helped me pass the time. But eventually, I got tired of looking at them. Just as I was feeling bored, I noticed a small notebook hanging on the wall, with the words "Suggestions Book" written on the cover. I curiously took it down and flipped through it. One patient had made the following suggestion:
    "...Today, when you extracted my tooth, you used too much force and immediately broke the tooth. Because the root was still left in the gum, it needed to be surgically removed. You used a knife to pull open my gums, and frantically dug with several tools like drills and chisels, finally managing to remove the root. Then you started stitching the wound. You broke three needles in a row. Later, I heard you had to borrow new needles from another department. After waiting a long time, you borrowed one. This time, you broke the small needle tip. What's worse, the small needle tip disappeared. You searched everywhere in my mouth, even using a small hook to poke around in the hole in my wound..." I couldn't bear to read any further. I quickly turned the page to see how the hospital responded:
    "Comrade, your criticism is basically correct, and we sincerely accept it." - The opening tone seemed very humble, but then it continued: "However, the situation that day must be explained to you: Your tooth was abnormally grown, which made the work somewhat difficult. Later, a few needles broke during stitching because we were using domestically produced needles bought from Shanghai. The quality of the needles was not good, and we are willing to apologize to you on behalf of the needle factory. As for taking some time to find the needle tip, it was completely worthwhile, because if the needle tip were left in the gum, it would cause future problems. However, we tried our best but still couldn't find it; perhaps it was washed away in the blood clot at the time..."
    My skin was covered in goosebumps. Originally, in my imagination, tooth extraction was a fairly simple matter, and I never expected it to be so complicated. My mood suddenly became tense. Just at this moment, the nurse stood at the door of the clinic and called out, "Number ten—Comrade Bu—Bu Xiaozhou—"
    "Here!" I tried to calm myself down, walked into the clinic, and sat down on the chair as instructed by the nurse.
    "This tooth of mine hurt for several days more than half a month ago, but now it basically doesn't hurt anymore..." Because of that passage in the "Suggestions Book," I became wary, so before the doctor could speak, I proactively gave a brief report, hoping to imply that he shouldn't operate.
    "Hmm..." The doctor was wearing a mask, so I couldn't see his reaction. He held a small spoon-like mirror in his left hand and a long-handled hook in his right hand, and moved these two instruments around in my mouth. Then, he used the handle of the hook to tap each of my teeth one by one. "Hmm... this tooth of yours is indeed bad... it needs to be extracted."
    His words gave me an impression of decisiveness and strong confidence. While filling out the medical record, he said, "Are you willing to have it extracted?"
    Doctors who adopt a consultative tone do indeed reduce the patient's concerns. However, I still wanted to clarify some things: "Will you operate immediately? Are there any difficulties?"
    "If you are willing, it can be extracted immediately. - There are no difficulties," he replied with great certainty.
    At this moment, I had a rather intense ideological struggle. Bad teeth should and must be extracted, I knew this principle. But the impression the "Suggestions Book" gave me really made me feel lingering fear, and I couldn't help but consider the possibility of an accident and its consequences.
    "Hey, what do you say, will you extract it?" the doctor urged again. His words were ordinary, but to me, they seemed to touch my self-esteem: I came to treat my teeth, the bad tooth must be extracted, what was there to hesitate about? Could it be that I would become a cowardly deserter in the face of such a small matter? So I generously replied, "Extract it!"
    The operation went very smoothly. Anesthesia was injected into the gums, and it didn't hurt at all. Finally, I happily left the hospital with a small slip of paper printed with "Precautions." All the way, I didn't dare to open my mouth, fearing that bacteria would fly into my mouth.
    I returned home, feeling unspeakably happy. The bad tooth was extracted, which meant I was relieved of a kind of pain. I really wanted to see what I looked like when I was triumphant. So I picked up a mirror to look at myself. At this moment, I suddenly remembered the scare I had after reading the "Suggestions Book" in the hospital just now - ha! What groundless fears! I couldn't help but find it funnier and funnier. Laughing, laughing, I saw my open mouth in the mirror.
    Heavens! Something made my smile freeze immediately. I rubbed my eyes and carefully observed again and again. The result proved that I really didn't see it wrong: that troublesome bad tooth was still proudly standing on the gum, while the one that had been extracted was its innocent neighbor.

    拔牙记
    卜小州
    半个多月以前，我的一颗牙齿突然疼了起来。俗话说：“牙疼不算病，疼起来要了命”，我算领教了。那颗捣蛋的坏牙齿几乎整整折磨了我一夜。第二天，我请了半天假到医院去治牙，可是病人太多，只能挂“预约”号。有什么办法呢？牙疼虽然疼得我很心焦，但是体温的确没达到38度以上，挂“急诊”自然是不行的，我只好捂着腮帮子回来了。还好，过了两天之后，疼痛却一点点减轻了。不过，我到底还是不放心，因为听说牙患若不及时治疗，到了老年可能引起腰酸骨痛、甚至半身不遂之类的病症。所以，到了“预约”那天，我还是到医院去了。
    在医院里，闷热的走廊两边坐满了候诊的人。好些有经验的病号都带着一本书或是一份杂志边看边等。我什么书刊都没有带来。幸而墙上的卫生宣传画给我打发了不少时间。可是，终于也看腻了。正在无聊的当儿，我发现墙上挂着一个小本子，封面上写有“意见簿”三个字。我好奇地把它拿下来翻阅了一下。有一位病人提了这样的意见：
    “……今天，你们给我拔牙的时候，用力过猛，登时就把牙齿钳碎了。因为牙根还留在牙床里，需要开刀把它取出来。你们就用刀子把我的牙肉拉开，还用几件像钻子、凿子之类的东西拼命地挖，好容易才把牙根取了出来。跟着就开始缝伤口。你们先后把缝针弄断了三根。后来，听说又到别的科里去借新针。等了老半天才借来。这回你们却把小针尖弄断了。更糟糕的是，小针尖不知落到哪里去了。你们在我的口腔里到处找，甚至用小钩子在我的伤口的窟窿里猛掏……”我看到这里，不忍看下去了。我连忙翻过一页去，看看医院方面是怎样答复的：
    “同志，你的批评基本上是正确的，我们衷心地接受。”——开头的语气似乎很谦虚，可是接下去的却是：“不过，那天的情况必须向你说明一下：你的牙齿是畸形生长的，工作上有些困难。后来缝伤口弄断了几支针，那是因为用的是从上海买来的国产缝针。缝针的质量不好，我们愿意代表制针的工厂向你道歉。至于找针尖费了一些时间，那完全是值得的，因为针尖如果遗留在牙床里是会有后患的。可是我们尽了最大的努力，还是找不着，也许当时混杂在血块里冲洗掉了……”
    我的皮肤表面不禁起了密密麻麻的鸡皮疙瘩。本来，在我想像里，拔牙是件相当简单的事儿，绝没有料想到会这么复杂。我的情绪骤然紧张起来。恰恰在这时候，护士同志站在诊室门口喊开了：“十号——卜同志——卜小州——”
    “有！”我努力使自己镇定下来，走进了诊室，按照护士的指示，坐到座椅上。
    “我这个牙齿半个多月以前痛了好几天，现在基本上不痛了……”因为“意见簿”上的那段话，使我有了戒心，所以不等大夫开口，我就主动地作了一个简单的汇报，目的是想暗示他最好不要动手术了。
    “嗯……”大夫戴着口罩，我看不出他的反应。他左手拿着一个像小杓似的镜子，右手拿着一个长柄的小钩针，把这两件家伙纳入我的口腔里活动了一番，又用钩针的柄子逐个逐个地敲击我的牙齿。“唔……你这个牙齿的确坏了……需要拔了。”
    他的话给了我一种果断、自信力很强的印象。他一边在病历单上填写病情纪录，一边说：“你愿意拔掉它吗？”
    凡是采取协商口吻的大夫，的确会减少病人的顾虑的。可是，我还要问清楚一些：“马上就动手术吗？没有什么困难吗？”
    “假如你愿意的话，马上就可以拔。——困难是没有的。”他很有把握地答复我。
    这时候，我起了一场相当激烈的思想斗争。坏牙齿应该而且必须拔掉，这道理我是知道的。可是“意见簿”给我的印象也实在使我心有余悸，不能不使我考虑到万一发生事故和它的后果。
    “喂，怎么样，拔吗？”大夫又催问了一句。他的话是平常的。但在我听来，却仿佛触动了我的自尊心：既来治牙，坏牙齿又必须拔掉，还犹豫什么呢？难道在这样一件小事面前，还要作一个临阵退缩的懦夫不成？于是我就慷慨地答道：“拔吧！”
    手术进行得十分顺利。牙床上注射了麻药，一点儿也不痛。最后，我愉快地拿着一张印有“注意事项”的小条子离开医院。一路上我都不敢张嘴，怕的是细菌飞进嘴里去。
    我回到家里，真是说不出的高兴。坏牙齿拔掉了，这就是说免除了一种痛苦。我很想看看自己得意的时候是个什么样子。于是就拿起一面镜子来照照。这时候，我忽然记起刚才在医院里看了“意见簿”之后的一场虚惊——哈！真是杞人忧天！我不禁越想越好笑，笑着，笑着，我就在镜子里看到了我自己张开了的嘴巴。
    天呀！有一件事情使我的笑容立即僵住了。我揉了揉眼睛，再三认真地观察，结果判明我真地没有看错：那个捣蛋的坏牙齿仍然骄傲地屹立在牙床上，被拔掉了的却是它隔壁的无辜的一颗。
