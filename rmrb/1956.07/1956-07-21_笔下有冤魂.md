Souls Wronged by the Pen
						Gongyang Geng

When people feel wronged and are denied sympathy and the chance to defend themselves, it’s understandable that they complain. However, the complaints should be reasonable. If there is no actual injustice, but someone dislikes everything they see, refuses to admit their own mistakes, and reverses right and wrong, then it's not a justified complaint, but a senseless grumble.

Grumbling should be opposed; complaints should be met with sympathy and a willingness to right the wrong.

However, Fan Rongkang's "Ten Years of Hard Study," published in the People's Daily on July 7th, treats complaints as grumbling and "criticizes" them.

The low rank and wages of college graduates are noteworthy facts. It's not unfounded that some people complain. In the past, this didn't receive the attention it deserved, and sympathy was lacking, because some people couldn't see the existing unreasonableness and treated all complaints as unwarranted grumbling. Premier Zhou Enlai, in his report on the issue of intellectuals, already criticized this unreasonable phenomenon. The author should be aware of this.

But the author says that only those who have "worked for several years and improved their work ability" or "have special talents and, even as new graduates, can handle more work" are "justified in complaining." The implication is that others deserve their situation because their pay is "already much higher than that of a newly hired worker." Therefore, their "demands are not positive and have nothing to do with the socialist principle of distribution according to work." The second half of that conclusion is a serious accusation. But the author has forgotten the difference between simple and complex labor, so how can he even talk about the socialist principle of distribution? No matter what you criticize, you can't ignore basic common sense. Otherwise, you are just twisting the truth.

The author traces the origin of the complaints to the fact that these graduates are suffering from the "ideological remnants" of "enduring hardship to become superior" and "all occupations are base, only studying is noble." Now, among college graduates, it can't be said that there are absolutely none of these people, but they are probably very few, because they have not received a feudal education.

What is the truth? The author hasn't even understood the true nature of the complaints. These complaints have been around for a long time; they didn't just "arise amidst the wage reform." Words are no proof, so here's a doggerel to demonstrate: "Ten years of hard study, still only one hundred and fifty, what you learn is not what you use, life is not taken care of, whoever dares to complain gets a hard spanking." The method of "spanking," of course, doesn't involve the sticks and boards used by the bailiffs of Sanhe County, but rather accusations like "not focusing on work," "individualism," "egalitarianism," "seeking enjoyment," and "bargaining with the revolution." Finally, they are labeled as having "no understanding of revolutionary work" and "a problem with their outlook on life." Problem solved. Even if it is somewhat exaggerated, it's not entirely related to the wage issue, but it is a cry against injustice, a kind of "suffering." The exposés in newspapers and magazines in recent years are its best annotation.

Whenever some people mention intellectuals, they always like to bring up phrases like "all occupations are base, only studying is noble," as if there are many such people. If you don't consider the specific conditions and invariably use this as a weapon to criticize intellectuals, easily smearing them with white powder and painting a picture of a wretched feudal scholar full of complaints because he couldn't get an official hat, you do no harm to the dead feudal scholars but are disrespectful to the living intellectuals and it doesn't conform to the facts.

Careless writing inevitably creates wronged souls. Such "criticism" cannot but make people feel wronged. Injustice breeds resentment. Old grievances haven't been resolved, and new ones arise. My short article belongs to the new resentment—which probably surprises the author.

    笔下有冤魂公羊庚
    人有不平，得不到同情和申辩，不免要发怨言，然而，怨得有道理。若是并无不平，只是看什么都不顺眼，连自己错了也不认账，把是非倒转，那就不是有理的怨言，而是无理的牢骚了。
    牢骚，要反对；怨言，要同情、要代抱不平。
    然而，七月七日人民日报登载的范荣康同志的“十年寒窗苦”，却把怨言视为牢骚而加以“批判”了。
    高等学校毕业生的级别低、工资低是值得注意的事实。有人发怨言，也不是无中生有。过去没引起应有的注意，得不到同情，是由于有人看不到不合理的存在，把怨言一律看作不该有的牢骚。周恩来总理在关于知识分子问题的报告中已经批评了这种不合理的现象。这是作者应该知道的。
    可是作者说只有“参加工作好几年了，工作能力提高了”，或“自己有特殊的才学，虽然是刚从学校毕业的学生，也能担负较多的工作”的人，才“怨得有理”。言外之意，其他理应如此，因为“比起一个刚进厂的工人所得到的报酬，已经高得多了”。因此，他们的“要求是没有积极意义的，它同按劳付酬的社会主义分配原则没有什么相同之处。”结论的后半句是给人扣上一项大帽子。可是前边连简单劳动和复杂劳动的区别都忘记了，还谈得上什么社会主义分配原则？不管批判什么，不顾及一般常识是不行的，否则，就是讲歪理。
    作者追了一下怨言的产生，据说并非由于不平，而是因为他们是受了“吃尽苦中苦，方为人上人”、“万般皆下品，唯有读书高”的“思想余毒”的人。现在，在高等学校毕业生中间，不能说绝对没有这种人，但恐怕是为数极微的，因为他们所受的究竟不是封建的教育。
    其实呢？作者连怨言的真相都还没弄清楚。此怨言由来已久，不是“在工资改革声中”才“传来了”的。空口无凭，有打油诗一首为证：“十年寒窗苦，还是一百五，所学非所用，生活不照顾，谁要提意见，狠狠打屁股。”打的方法，当然用的不是三河县的皂役们用的棍子、板子，而是什么“工作不安心，”、“个人主义”、“平均主义”、“贪图享受”、“和革命讲价钱”，诸如此类。最后来一个“对革命工作没认识”、“人生观有问题”。万事大吉。即使有些夸大，也不全和工资问题有关，但不失为不平之鸣，是一种“苦”。几年来报刊上的揭发，就是它最好的注解。
    有的人一提到知识分子，总喜欢把“万般皆下品，唯有读书高”之类搬出来，以为如此这般的大有人在。如果不看具体条件，以不变应万变地引用来作为批判知识分子的武器，轻而易举地给他们抹一鼻子白粉，画出一幅活像争不到乌纱帽而满腹牢骚的封建文人那样的卑陋像。这对死去了的封建文人毫无损害，而对现在活着的知识分子却未免太不尊重，而且也并不符合事实。
    笔下不留神，必定出冤魂。这样的“批判”不能不让人感到冤枉。冤必生怨。旧怨尚未全平，新怨又起。我的短文就是属于新怨的——这大概出乎作者意料之外吧。
