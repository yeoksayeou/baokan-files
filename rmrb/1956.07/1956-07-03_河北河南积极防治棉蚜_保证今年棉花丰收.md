Hebei and Henan Actively Prevent and Control Cotton Aphids
Guarantee a Bumper Cotton Harvest This Year

(Our report) Agricultural production cooperatives in cotton-producing areas of Hebei Province, such as Handan, Xingtai, and Shijiazhuang, have already completed technical training and prepared medicines and equipment for the prevention and control of cotton pests. Agricultural production cooperatives have also established organizations for aphid control and implemented a division of labor with individual responsibility. This year, many agricultural cooperatives in these areas have specifically included pest control labor and medicine/equipment investment in their annual production plans and short-term plans. Some special districts' agricultural cooperatives have also promoted a pest control method that specifies quality, quantity, labor, and complete responsibility. Due to the good organization of this year's cotton aphid control work, timely prevention and control can generally be achieved in these areas. As of early June, incomplete statistics from fifty-three counties in the province show that over 1,788,000 mu of cotton fields have been treated, accounting for 37% of the affected area.

Henan Province's Anyang Special District began experimenting with aerial application for cotton aphid control on May 21st. Preliminary experimental results show that using aircraft to control aphids not only saves labor and medicine but also has a very good killing effect, with an average insecticidal efficiency of over 80%. Large-scale aerial application for cotton aphid control began on June 1st. Aerial aphid control has greatly encouraged the farmers here, who said, "With the airplane helping us control the 'ant drought' (i.e., cotton aphids), a bumper cotton harvest this year is even more guaranteed."

Some counties in this special district are also carrying out manual cotton aphid control. Many members of the agricultural production cooperatives in Tangyin County have joined the fight against pests. The Han Zhuang Lighthouse Agricultural Production Cooperative mobilizes more than 1,000 people every day to control aphids. The Anyang Baibi Red Star Agricultural Production Cooperative mobilizes more than 1,000 female members every day to control aphids, and the cooperative's cotton fields have now generally undergone one to three treatments.

    河北河南积极防治棉蚜
    保证今年棉花丰收
    本报讯　河北省邯郸、邢台、石家庄等棉产区的农业生产合作社已经作好了防治棉花虫害的技术训练、药械准备工作的农业生产合作社还建立了防治蚜虫的组织，实行分工包干负责制度。今年，这些地区的不少农业合作社，把治虫用工和药械投资都具体的列入了全年生产计划和小段计划。有些专区的农业合作社还推行了定质、定量、定工，一包到底的治虫办法。由于今年的防治棉蚜工作组织的好，这些地区一般能作到防治及时。截至六月初全省五十三个县不完全的统计，已经防治的棉田有1，788，000多亩，占发生面积37％。
    河南省安阳专区从五月二十一日开始采用飞机防治棉蚜的试验。初步试验结果，采用飞机治蚜不但省工省药，而且杀伤效果很好，平均的杀虫效率在80％以上。用飞机大面积防治棉蚜已由六月一日开始了。飞机防治棉蚜对这里的农民鼓舞很大，他们说：“飞机帮助咱们治蚁旱（即棉蚜），今年棉花的丰收就更有保障了。”
    这个专区的一些县，同时开展了人工防治棉蚜工作。汤阴县的许多农业生产社的社员都投入了治虫的斗争中。韩庄灯塔农业生产社每天出动治蚜虫的有一千多人。安阳白璧红星农业生产合作社每天有一千多名妇女社员出动治蚜，全社的棉田，现在已普遍除治一至三遍。
