    Travel Musings
    The Advantages and Disadvantages of Paint, and Other Matters
    Sun Qian Haimo
    The Western Hills of Kunming are a wonderful scenic area. Within the Western Hills, the most alluring place is Dragon Gate. Passing through the Sanqing Pavilion, those buildings perched precariously on the cliff face, and climbing upwards, you will find a narrow path carved along the cliff by a skilled craftsman. The stone path is very narrow, only wide enough for one person to pass sideways in some places. On this path, one side is the stone wall, and the other side has windows carved into the rock. Looking out from these windows, below is the picturesque Dianchi Lake. Walking here feels like soaring over Dianchi Lake. Further ahead, a stone archway appears at the end of the stone path. Entering the archway is the famous Dragon Gate. Here you can see a series of exquisite stone carvings and statues. At the front are the stone-carved thresholds and lintels, and inside are stone incense burners and offering tables. At the front is a statue of Kui Xing, and on the wall behind are bas-reliefs of the Eight Immortals Crossing the Sea. In front of the gate and along both corridors are stone inscriptions and poems by famous calligraphers of past dynasties.
    There is a beautiful legend about this place. It is said that initially, a young man, heartbroken from a failed love affair, came to this place. He devoted his life to carving the mountain and creating a path, hollowing out the entire dangerous cliff, and then carving this vivid group of buildings from the original stone. Unfortunately, as he was about to complete his great work, he accidentally broke the tip of Kui Xing's pen, so he sadly threw himself into Dianchi Lake and died.
    Regardless of the legend, in fact, I think such lifelike stone sculptures are rare. The exquisite carvings left to us by the ancients probably never imagined that later generations would dress them in gaudy and vulgar painted garments.
    It should be said that the people who decided to paint these buildings did so out of good intentions, out of a desire to preserve cultural relics. But they didn't realize that their own cultural level was completely incompatible with this task. All their careful efforts not only failed to protect the artifacts but instead turned these great sculptures into something resembling the most shoddy goods on the market. Look, Kui Xing has been painted so that his nose and eyes have moved, and the excellent calligraphy has been painted over with colorful paint, making it worse than a child's tracing practice. The chisel marks on the stone are invisible, and the vivid postures are completely obscured.
    Paint has not only done a bad thing in Kunming but also in Zhongshan Park in Hankou. Walking into Zhongshan Park in Hankou, the gaudy and colorful paint gives one the immediate impression of being in a paper offering shop.
    Thinking about public places of interest from the perspective of paint, what we have seen along the way evokes many emotions.
    We saw photos of the Qu Yuan Memorial Hall being built in Wuhan in the newspaper. But for those who have been to East Lake, they will surely feel sorry for this great poet. In East Lake, there are many beautiful Chinese-style buildings with glazed tile roofs. But these buildings are used to sell tea and cigarettes. And the Qu Yuan Memorial Hall, the memorial hall of this great poet, is squeezed into a small two-story Western-style building. The reason given is that economic work is more important, probably because Qu Yuan, although a great poet, cannot increase their economic income.
    Speaking of this, we cannot help but recall an unpleasant incident we heard about a month ago. This memorial hall was open for a few days in March and April 1955, but it was closed again in May and June. From then on, beds for sleeping were placed under the ancient calligraphy and paintings that had been carefully collected. The people said that every Saturday they saw some leading cadres from the Construction Bureau come here to spend the weekend. The people asked, "Why don't you let us visit? Why can you be up there in pairs?" We all know that there are calligraphic works by Vice Chairman Zhu De and Mr. Sun Yat-sen in this house, but these people from the Construction Bureau do not allow people to browse them, but use them as a summer retreat for their personal weekends. Finally, we learned that it is managed by the Construction Bureau. But the Construction Bureau's allocation of 100 million yuan to build East Lake has actually caused our great poet to be treated coldly.
    In fact, this is not the only public cultural place or historical site that is not open to the public.
    The former site of the Guangzhou Peasant Movement Training Institute, founded by Chairman Mao, is often closed. The Five Lords Temple in Haikou City, Hainan Island, is the same. But these places only have one exception, which is when they hear the sound of a car horn at the door, they immediately open the door. No wonder some people compare cars to a pass. These places respect cars more than people.

    旅途杂感
    油漆的优缺点及其他
    孙谦　海默
    昆明西山是一片绝妙的风景区。在西山中，最诱人的地方就是龙门了。穿过三清阁那些峭立在崖壁上的建筑，攀登而上，就会见到有一位巧匠沿悬崖凿开的一条甬道。石头甬道很窄，有的地方只能容一人侧身而过。在这甬道中，一边是石壁，一边是岩石上凿开的窗洞。从这些洞孔中望出去，山下就是那碧波如画的滇池。走在这里，就像在滇池上腾空而过。再向前，石头甬道前面就出现了一座石坊。进了石坊，就是有名的龙门了。在这里已能见到一系列精彩的石雕和群像，最前面是石雕的门槛、门楣，进内则是石雕的香炉、香案。正面是一尊魁星，后面壁上浮雕着八仙过海，门前和两廊尚有历代名家的石刻题咏。
    关于此地，有个美丽的传说。相传最初有一个青年，因为失恋了，来到此地。他用了毕生精力凿山取途，将这一危崖全部镂空，又用原来石头雕成了这片生动的建筑群。不幸在他大功垂成的时候，误将魁星的笔尖折断，于是他伤心地跃身投入滇池死去了。
    不管传说如何，就事实论，我想这样栩栩欲生的石雕群像是少有的。古人为我们留下的这些精美的雕刻，大概从未想到后人会给他穿上五光十色的鄙俗不堪的油漆彩衣。
    应该说决定给这些建筑涂漆的人是出于好心，出于想保存文化遗迹。可是没想到他自己的文化水平与这工作却绝不调和，他的一切精心经营非但没保护了古物，反而将这些伟大雕刻弄得类似市场上最拙劣的商品。你看吧，魁星被涂得鼻子眼都搬了家，绝佳的书法被五彩油漆描得尚不如小学生的描红。石上的刀法看不见了，生动的姿态全被掩盖了。
    油漆不仅在昆明作了一件坏事，在汉口的中山公园也同样。走进汉口中山公园里，见到那些五光十色的彩漆，会使人立刻产生一种错觉，以为自己是置身在纸扎铺里。
    从油漆联想到公共游览场所，这一路所见，是使人感慨很多的。
    我们曾在报纸上见到了武汉建立屈原纪念馆的照片。可是对于到过东湖的人，他一定会为这位大诗人惋惜的。在东湖有很多幢精美的琉璃瓦屋顶的中国风格的建筑。但这些建筑却是用来卖茶、卖烟。而屈原，这位伟大的诗人的纪念馆，却挤在一个两层洋式的小楼里。理由据说是经济工作更重要，可能由于屈原虽是伟大诗人但还不能使他们增加经济收入的缘故吧。
    说到这里使我们不能不想起在一个月前听到的一桩不愉快的事件。就是这个纪念馆，在1955年三、四月间曾开放过几天，可是到了五、六月间又关闭了。从此，屋内那些精心搜集到的古字画下面却摆上了睡觉用的床。老百姓说，每到星期六就看见有些建设局的领导干部来这儿度周末。老百姓曾问过：“为什么不让我们参观？为什么你们在上面可以成双成对？”我们都知道在这屋里有朱德副主席和孙中山先生的字迹，可是这些建设局的人却不让人们浏览，而用来作为个人过礼拜六的避暑地。最后我们才知道这是建设局管理的。可是给建设局所拨的一亿建设东湖的经费，居然使我们的大诗人遭到冷遇。
    其实，公共文化场所和有历史意义的故址，不准游览的还不止于此。
    毛主席所办的广州农民讲习所故址，是经常封闭着大门的。海南岛海口市的五公祠也同样。但这些地方只有一种场合是例外，就是当他们听见门口有汽车的喇叭声时，立刻就把大门打开了。难怪有人把汽车比作通行证。这些地方对汽车比对人更尊重的多。
