I Love the Qinling Mountains
    Tang Zhili

    Three and a half years ago, when I was studying at the Hengyang Railway School in Hunan, I once traveled through the Qinling Mountains by car. The car kept crawling along the cliffs, and everywhere along the road were alarming signs saying "Beware of Danger!" "Beware of Sharp Turns!" Every time the car went through a sharp turn, my heart would pound. It wasn't until the car finally crossed the Qinling Mountains that I breathed a long sigh of relief and wiped the sweat from my face. That was my first impression of the Qinling Mountains.

    Only a little over a year later, I came to the Qinling Mountains again. This time I was not just passing through, but as a fighter for building the motherland, to build a railway in the Qinling Mountains that would connect the southwest and northwest of the motherland.

    When I first arrived in the Qinling Mountains, they seemed even more dangerous than my first impression. The peaks were high and steep, and every time I looked up at the peaks, my hat would slip off my head. The mountains were covered with weeds and shrubs that were taller than a person. There were no inhabitants, and everywhere there were wild animals, including bears, wolves, deer, and some unknown animals. Once, some wild animal sneaked into our kitchen and stole our steamed buns. We had to lock the doors of our work sheds at night. To be honest, I was very nervous at the time.

    What was most troublesome was climbing the mountains. Many of the mountains here didn't even have a path to walk on, only the tracks of wild animals. My task, along with another female intern, Bai Shuxuan, was to survey the route, and we had to climb several mountains every day. I remember the first time Bai Shuxuan and I went to the south entrance of the Qinling Tunnel to survey. At first, we climbed very fast, but soon our legs became sore, and we had to grit our teeth and keep climbing. Unexpectedly, I stepped on a loose rock, and the rock rolled down the mountain. Luckily, I quickly grabbed the nearby weeds and shrubs, and didn't roll down with it. But my palms were throbbing with pain, and tears came to my eyes. It turned out that I had grabbed a poisonous weed, and my palms were red and swollen, and even my arms were covered with small blisters. At that time, I really wanted to sit down and cry, but the surveyor was calling me from the top of the mountain, so I had no time to cry and had to endure the pain and climb up. That night, I lay in bed for a long time, thinking for a long time. I thought of the Long March of 25,000 miles, weren't there many female comrades who climbed snow-capped mountains and crossed grasslands? What is this little bit of hardship that I am suffering? I secretly said to myself: You shouldn't be afraid of difficulties, you should say to difficulties: "Difficulty, I look down on you."

    The next day when we went up the mountain, Bai Shuxuan and I did not lag behind the surveyors at all. Once, after we finished surveying on a high and steep mountain, we had to go to another mountain to survey. The surveyors all slid down the hillside, and Xiaobai and I followed suit without hesitation. Not only did we not feel afraid or painful, but we also joked, "This is our automatic elevator!"

    As the project progressed, more and more workers were transferred from various places. Along the Qingjiang River, on both sides of the Sichuan-Shaanxi Highway, work sheds, shops, and barbershops were built one after another. Day and night, hundreds of cars came and went, and the roar of machines and the sound of explosions never stopped. We called the construction site "the city in the mountains." Isn't it? The population density of this "city" per square meter is probably higher than the largest city in the world. Especially on Sundays, tens of thousands of workers play on various mountain peaks. Some fish in the Qingjiang River, some organize mountain climbing, and some go to the "garden" to collect flowers (in the valley, there are wild peach blossoms, pear blossoms, and many flowers that I can't name). In the past, we were afraid of wild animals, but now we call the Qinling Mountains "our zoo." There are flocks of pheasants, squirrels with big tails, and sometimes we even see two bears rolling around on the mountain top playing... The best thing is that there are building materials everywhere in the valley. The steep cliffs are cut into stone blocks and used to build magnificent stone arch bridges...

    Through our hands, the face of the Qinling Mountains has changed, becoming kinder, and I have unknowingly fallen in love with it!

    With this kind of emotion, it seems that my whole body has gained strength and courage. Things that I thought were very difficult in the past now feel like there is a way. I boldly accepted the task of becoming the technical captain of the bridge construction team, which I would have definitely declined in the past. I remember the first time I met the workers in the team, I could see from their eyes that they didn't trust me. Several mischievous workers even deliberately said, "Our female captain is here, let her come and carry dirt with us, let's see if she can carry it?" I followed them and said with a smile, "Come on, let me try carrying a few baskets of dirt." I took a worker's basket, filled it with dirt, and then carried it with another worker. Carrying dirt is really not easy, it pressed my shoulders so hard that they hurt, but I endured it. When I was about to carry the fourth basket, the workers rushed to stop me, saying that they wouldn't let me carry it anymore. From then on, the workers greeted me very warmly when they saw me, and they would take the initiative to come to me and ask for my opinion no matter what happened. Our team was as united as one person, and any problems in the work were solved by everyone together, so we were able to complete our tasks successfully every time.

    I remember it was a clear day in February, and we were building Bridge No. 3 at Guanyin Station. Suddenly, the whistle of a locomotive came from the north of the Qinling Mountains. This was the first time we heard the roar of a train in the Qinling Mountains. The train came speeding along the railway we had built with our own hands. People were immediately attracted by the whistle, and everyone cheered in unison. My heart was pounding with the whistle, and tears of excitement welled up in my eyes. Someone suddenly shouted, "Hurry up and work, or the locomotive will run over our butts!" The workers were extremely happy, and their movements were many times faster than usual. I was so excited that I didn't know what to do, helping to transport materials for a while, jumping into the foundation for a while... No one felt tired, and everyone smiled knowingly when they met, because our project was about to be completed victoriously.

    But when we were really about to leave the Qinling Mountains, we felt uncomfortable again. For two years, the Qinling Mountains have been like my old home, no, it is even more familiar than my old home. Here, I learned rich construction experience and learned how to overcome difficulties.

    Finally, when we got into the car to bid farewell to the Qinling Mountains, everyone looked back reluctantly, looking at our construction site, gazing at the Qinling Mountains, and silently said, "Goodbye, Qinling Mountains, we will come back to see you!" (Attached picture)

    我爱秦岭
    汤之莉
    三年半以前，我在湖南衡阳铁路学校学习的时候，曾经乘坐汽车经过秦岭。汽车一直沿着悬崖峭壁爬行，公路两边到处树立着令人心惊的“小心危险！”“小心急弯！”的标志，每当汽车驶过一个急弯，我心里就“噗噗”跳一阵。好容易盼到汽车越过秦岭，才长长地出了一口气，揩揩脸上的汗水。这就是秦岭给我的第一次的印象。
    只隔了一年多的时间，我又来到了秦岭。这次不是路过这里，而是作为一个建设祖国的战士，在秦岭丛山中修建一条贯通祖国西南和西北的铁路。
    刚刚来到秦岭的时候，它比第一次给我的印象还要险恶。山峰又高又陡，每次仰头看山峰的时候，帽子都要从头上滑下来。满山遍野都是一人多高的野草和灌木。没有人烟，到处是野兽，有熊、狼、麂以及一些不知名的动物。有一次不知是什么野兽竟钻到我们的厨房里把馍偷吃掉了。我们在夜晚不得不把工棚的门锁上。说实在的，当时的心情是非常紧张的。
    使人感到最苦恼的是爬山，这里的很多山头，连一条可以通行的小路都没有，只有野兽践踏的痕迹。而我和另外一个女实习生白淑萱的任务是测量线路，每天都要爬行几个山头。记得我和白淑萱第一次上秦岭隧道南口去测量的时候，开始还爬得很快，不一会两条腿就酸疼起来，只好咬着牙继续爬上去。想不到一脚蹬在一块孤石上，石头向山下滚去，幸好我赶紧抓住附近的野草和灌木，才没有跟着滚下去。可是两只手掌却剧烈地疼起来，眼泪都流出来了。原来抓的是一种毒草，手掌红肿了一片，连胳膊上也起了一片小水泡。那时候，我真想坐下来哭一场，可是测工在山头上喊我，哪里顾得上哭，只得忍着疼痛往上爬。晚上，躺了很久，也想了很久。想到二万五千里长征时，不是有许多女同志同样爬雪山，过草地吗？我吃这一点苦，能算什么呢？我暗暗地对自己说：你不应该怕困难，应该对困难说：“困难，我瞧不起你。”
    第二天上山的时候，我和白淑萱一步也没有落在测工的后边。有一次我们在一个又高又陡的山头上测量完之后，要到另一个山头去测量。测工们都顺着山坡滑下去了，我和小白也毫不犹疑地跟着滑下去，不但不感到害怕和痛苦，而且还取笑着说：“这是我们的自动电梯呀！”
    随着工程的进展，从各地调来的工人多了。在清姜河畔，沿着川陕公路两侧，一座一座的工棚、商店、理发馆都建立起来。不管白天黑夜，成百辆的汽车川流不息地驶来驶去，机器吼叫的声音和爆破的声音整天不断。我们把工地叫作“山中的都市”。不是吗？这个“都市”每平方公尺的人口密度恐怕比世界上最大的都市还要稠。尤其是在星期日，几万职工在各个山头上游玩，有的在清姜河里钓鱼，有的组织爬山，有的到“花园”里去采集鲜花（在山谷里到处是野生的桃花、梨花以及许许多多叫不出名字的鲜花）。过去我们害怕野兽，现在却把秦岭称为“我们的动物园”。这里有成群的山鸡，有拖着大尾巴的松鼠，有时还看见两个狗熊在山头上滚来滚去闹着玩……。最好的是山谷里到处都是建筑材料，陡峭的悬崖被打成石方，用来建成一座一座壮丽的石拱桥……
    经过我们的双手，秦岭的面貌改变了，变得亲切了，我竟不知不觉地爱上了它！
    有了这种情感，好像混身都增加了力量和勇气，过去认为非常困难的事情，现在感到有办法了。我大胆地接受了去桥工小队当技术队长的任务，这在过去无论如何是要推辞掉的。记得第一次和小队的工人见面时，从工人的眼神里可以看出他们是不信任我的。有几个比较调皮的工人还故意说：“我们的女队长来了，请她来跟我们一起抬土，看她能抬得动？”我也就随着走过去，笑着对他们说：“来，让我抬几筐土试一试看。”我接过一个工人的筐装土，然后和另一个工人抬起来就走。抬土可真不容易呀，压得肩膀直疼，但是，我忍住了。等到抬第四筐的时候，工人们都抢着拦我，说什么也不让我抬了。从那以后，工人们看见我都非常亲热的打招呼，不管有什么事情都主动地找我，征求我的意见。我们小队团结得简直像一个人一样，工作中有了问题都是大家商量着解决，因此每次都能出色地完成任务。
    记得是二月的一个晴朗的日子，我们正在修建观音车站的三号桥。忽然，从秦岭北面传来了机车的汽笛声。这是我们在秦岭上第一次听见火车的吼声，火车从我们亲手修建的铁路上驰过来了。人们立即被汽笛声吸引住，每个人都不约而同地欢呼起来，我的心也随着汽笛声噗噗地跳动，眼里激动得流泪。不知是谁突然喊了一声：“赶快干吧，不然机车就要轧我们的屁股了！”工人们高兴极了，动作比平时不知快了多少倍。我自己也兴奋得不知如何是好，一会帮助运料，一会跳进基础里去……。谁也不知道劳累，见了面都会心地笑笑，因为我们的工程就要胜利完工了。
    可是，真要我们离开秦岭的时候，却又感到难受。二年来，秦岭就像我的老家一样，不，它比老家还要亲切。在这里，我学到了丰富的施工经验，学会了如何战胜困难。
    最后，当我们坐上汽车，告别秦岭的时候，大家都恋恋不舍地回过头去，看望我们的工地，眺望着秦岭，默默地说：“再见吧，秦岭，我们还要回来看你的！”（附图片）
