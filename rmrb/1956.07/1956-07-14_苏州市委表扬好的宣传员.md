    Suzhou Municipal Party Committee Commends Good Propagandists
    (Our dispatch) The Suzhou Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China recently commended and rewarded seventy-five relatively good propagandists. Among them were five outstanding propagandists: Yang Xuehong, Zhao Suzhen, Cha Jingen, Zhou Caigen, and Fang Shilong. Yang Xuehong is a porter who uses the storytelling format, which workers love most, to conduct propaganda among the masses in conjunction with the central tasks, and is very popular among the workers. Zhao Suzhen is a roving worker and union leader at the Sulun Yarn Factory. The main characteristic of her propaganda work is that she cares about people and does people's work. She united the group of activists to organize a home visiting team, who regularly visit workers' homes to help workers solve many specific problems such as quarrels between husband and wife, arranging life, and family members seeking medical treatment; she also mobilized the group of workers to learn culture and help workers improve their skills. Now their group has become an advanced literacy group in Suzhou and an advanced group in the factory. This group of better propagandists were rewarded at the grassroots propaganda work conference convened by the Propaganda Department of the Suzhou Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China.
