    Improve Dietary Provisions for Migrants
    Recently, each of the 351st migrant trains departing from Henan carried over a thousand people. These migrants brought many steamed buns and biscuits when they boarded in Henan, intending to eat them on the journey. However, because they brought too many steamed buns and the biscuit quality was poor, they spoiled due to the long travel time. As far as I know, several thousand kilograms of steamed buns have spoiled since July alone. Due to the poor work of the Henan Provincial Immigration Work Committee in providing food along the way, migrants sometimes have to eat moldy and hairy steamed buns during the journey, which affects their health. I hope the relevant departments will inspect the work of the Henan Immigration Committee.

    改善对移民的饮食供应
    最近从河南开出的351次移民列车，每趟都有一千余人，这些移民从河南上车时带了很多馒头和饼干，准备在路上食用。但是，因为馒头带的太多，饼干质量不好，在路上时间过长，就霉坏了。据我所知，七月以来，仅馒头就霉坏了几千斤。由于河南省移民工作委员会沿途饮食供应工作做的不好，移民在中途有时还得食用已经霉坏和长毛的馒头，因而影响了移民的健康。希望有关部门检查河南移民委员会的工作。
