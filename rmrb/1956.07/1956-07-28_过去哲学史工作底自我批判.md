Self-Criticism of Past Work in the History of Philosophy
Feng Youlan

Editor's Note: Mr. Feng Youlan was one of the representatives of the old philosophical circles in China in the past. His "A History of Chinese Philosophy" used to be a popular textbook in universities, and his books such as "New Rational Philosophy" written during the Anti-Japanese War systematically established and elaborated his own philosophical views. These books had a great influence among intellectuals before liberation. "The Peking University Journal (Humanities)" published Feng Youlan's self-criticism article and Wang Zisong's critical article in the second issue of 1956. Now, an abstract of the former article is published here. We believe that it is good to adopt this method of criticism and self-criticism in academics.

In a semi-feudal and semi-colonial country, the work of the history of philosophy, which runs through the philosophical thought of the bourgeoisie, is a form of the combination of the philosophical thought of the bourgeoisie and the philosophical thought of feudalism.

My past work on the history of Chinese philosophy was to combine a kind of bourgeois philosophical thought, neo-realism's objective idealism, more closely with the ruling ideology of Chinese feudal society, so that it could have a "flashback" when it was dying in the face of the people's revolution.

I flaunted neo-realism, but I didn't completely reject pragmatism. I once tried to link neo-realism and pragmatism, two equally corrupt bourgeois philosophical thoughts. Idealist philosophy originally tends towards agnosticism. Because I wanted to maintain contact with pragmatism, the color of agnosticism was even more intense in my past philosophical thought. The reason why agnosticism leaves something "unknowable" is precisely to leave a "forbidden area" for religion and open a door for mysticism. My past philosophical thoughts also ultimately led to mysticism.

The so-called objective idealism of neo-realism, the agnosticism of pragmatism, and the mysticism of religion, these are all the corrupt philosophical elements of the bourgeoisie in my past philosophical thought. It was precisely on the basis of these elements that I carried out the work of the history of Chinese philosophy, in order to combine it with Chinese feudalist philosophy. Its significance is to distort the history of Chinese philosophy, cover up class struggle, and oppose the dialectical materialism and historical materialism of Marxism.

Philosophy is a component of the superstructure of society and a major tool of class struggle. Although it is expressed as the thought of certain philosophers, it is actually a reflection of the economic and political demands and desires of certain social classes or strata. In "A History of Chinese Philosophy," I quoted a saying by James, one of the founders of pragmatism, believing that "philosophers each have their own 'view,' and they all take their 'view' as the fundamental meaning and apply it to all aspects" ("A History of Chinese Philosophy," p. 12). The "view" that James mentioned was originally a religious term. Religious figures sometimes have a hallucination and believe that they have a special ability to communicate with "God," and therefore have knowledge that ordinary people cannot have. James used this term to mystify philosophy. I quoted this term in "A History of Chinese Philosophy" to also mystify philosophy, saying that it is only the result of individual "genius," not a social product, nor a tool of class struggle. This statement itself is precisely to serve the ruling exploiting class, precisely a tool of class struggle.

Later, in "New Rational Philosophy," I further extended this mystical thought, thus completely revealing the absurdity of objective idealism. In "New Rational Philosophy," I believed that there was a so-called "natural philosophical system" before any philosophical thought was made. Before the various schools of philosophy, there were already "natural systems" of each school. The objective idealism of the Cheng-Zhu school said "there is the Book of Changes before the painting." According to my explanation, this means that there were already the eight trigrams before the eight trigrams were drawn.

This is a particularly absurd part of "New Rational Philosophy." "New Rational Philosophy" believes that "airplanes have the principles of airplanes." This is not wrong, the mistake lies in thinking that "principle comes first," that is, there was already the "principle of airplanes" before there were airplanes.

There are many philosophical schools in the history of philosophy. This is the manifestation of the consciousness of different classes and strata in class society. However, in "New Rational Philosophy," I declared that since there are various different philosophical systems in reality, there should also be various corresponding "natural philosophical systems" in the ethereal so-called "metaphysical aspect." The "view" of a philosopher is to have a "view" of these "natural systems." Every philosophical system that already exists in the history of philosophy should be in line with its "natural system," but we cannot know whether they are actually in line. We only see whether it can "justify itself, have a reason for holding on, and make sense in words" ("New Rational Philosophy," p. 235). This is an agnostic statement. Objective idealism must eventually lead to agnosticism, this is an example.

Why do philosophers in the history of philosophy have different "views"? In "A History of Chinese Philosophy," I also believed that this was due to the different temperaments of philosophers. I also quoted the opinion of James, one of the founders of pragmatism, believing that "according to the temperament of philosophers, they can be divided into two categories: soft-hearted philosophers and hard-hearted philosophers." When discussing Xunzi in "A History of Chinese Philosophy," I used this absurd statement to explain why Xunzi and Mencius were different. I said: "Mencius is a soft-hearted philosopher, and his philosophy has an idealistic tendency. Xunzi is a hard-hearted philosopher, and his philosophy has a materialistic tendency" ("A History of Chinese Philosophy," p. 352). According to this absurd statement, in the history of Chinese philosophy, the emergence of the two opposing and struggling idealistic and materialistic systems represented by Mencius and Xunzi is only accidental. If there were no "soft-hearted" people like Mencius, there would be no idealistic system represented by him. If there were no "hard-hearted" people like Xunzi, there would be no materialistic system represented by him. In this way, the development of the history of philosophy is completely an accumulation of accidental events, with no rules and no possibility of having rules. This statement is completely opposed to historical materialism.

Materialism and idealism are the two major camps in philosophy. Materialist thought is often associated with the progressive class of society; idealist thought is often associated with the reactionary class. This is the reflection of class struggle in thought, and it is also the law of the development of the history of philosophy. In terms of the history of Chinese philosophy, Mencius supported the hereditary aristocracy at the time. He believed that there was a "heaven," that is, God, who ruled the world, and promoted idealistic doctrines such as "divine right of kings." Xunzi was the spokesperson of the emerging landlord class, promoting a materialist world view, opposing religion, and sharply criticizing Mencius. This kind of ideological struggle is a concrete manifestation of the law of the development of pre-Qin philosophy, and it is by no means accidental.

After "A History of Chinese Philosophy" was published, I published another "Supplement to the History of Chinese Philosophy," putting forward another set of absurd statements about the origin of the pre-Qin philosophers, attempting to confuse historical materialism. According to this statement, I believed that the different schools of pre-Qin philosophy came from different occupations. For example, the Confucian school came from Confucian scholars who mastered ancient culture. The Mohist school came from warriors who made weapons. The pre-Qin six schools came from six occupations. Their different thoughts are the reflections of their different morals and behaviors in different occupations. This is an attempt to use the division of labor in society to explain the divisions of schools in the history of philosophy, in order to replace Marxism's correct theory of using social class struggle to explain the "two armies facing each other" in the history of philosophy.

In "A History of Chinese Philosophy," I believed that a doctrine has its "intrinsic value," that is to say, if a doctrine has value, its value lies in itself, in the fact that it itself becomes a theoretical system. This is to use an idealistic view to oppose Marxism's theory of reflection. Marxism's theory of reflection believes that if a doctrine has a certain value, its value lies in the fact that it correctly reflects objective reality to a certain extent, and in the social sciences, it also lies in the fact that it reflects the needs of the forward development of the social economy and the interests of the people to a certain extent.

A valuable philosophy must be a theoretical system, this is of course. But being a theoretical system is a phenomenon. Its essence is that it reflects objective reality to a certain extent. A philosophy that can reflect objective reality to a certain extent must be a theoretical system, but a theoretical system does not necessarily reflect objective reality. According to my "putting the cart before the horse" view, the value of a philosophy lies in whether its theoretical system is complete and detailed, regardless of the extent to which it reflects objective reality. Because according to my agnostic point of view, we have no other way to determine whether it reflects objective reality except to see whether a philosophy is "justified, has a reason for holding on, and makes sense in words."

There are many theoretical systems in the history of philosophy, the content of which is completely opposite. Therefore, in "A History of Chinese Philosophy," I came to the conclusion that philosophy is inherently dissimilar to science, but similar to literature and religion. Philosophy is inherently a subject where "the public says the public has a reason, and the wife says the wife has a reason."

When I wrote "A History of Chinese Philosophy," I used this "detached attitude." I regarded bourgeois objectivism as the objective attitude of science. I declared that a good historian of philosophy should stand in the position of that philosophy when talking about that philosophy, rethink his thoughts with a sympathetic attitude, and then narrate them without adding or subtracting. Such treatment is to make idealistic thought and materialist thought mixed and indistinguishable. In "A History of Chinese Philosophy," I also do not distinguish which philosophical school is idealistic and which philosophical school is materialistic. The mutual criticism between the various schools, no matter how fierce, is said to be due to the different "views" of the philosophers.

The bourgeoisie conceals its position in order to deceive the people. Objectivism is one of the methods it uses to conceal its position. The position cannot be concealed. In "A History of Chinese Philosophy," I superficially said that I believe that each school has "contributions," and that I want to narrate all of their "contributions," but in fact, standing on my past idealistic position, the real contributions are invisible, and it is impossible to see them. I superficially said that I take a "detached" and "neutral" attitude towards all schools, treating them "equally," but in fact there are praises and criticisms, suppression and promotion. The narration of the thoughts of Confucius and Mozi is a good example.

Confucius is basically an idealist, but his educational thought teaches people to see and hear more, and to gain knowledge from sensory experience. He emphasized learning, teaching people to accumulate knowledge from learning. This is a materialist point of view. In the history of Chinese philosophy, Mozi was the first to consciously raise the issue of the standard of truth, and proposed the "three standards" as the criterion for measuring whether all thoughts and speeches are correct. He believed that correct thoughts and speeches must have historical basis, must conform to the sensory experience of the people, and finally must be tested in political practice to see if they are in line with the interests of the country and the people. This is also a materialist point of view, but I either did not mention these points at all, or only mentioned them briefly.

In "A History of Chinese Philosophy," I believe that the main difference between Confucius and Mozi lies in the fact that Confucius focuses on "benevolence and righteousness," while Mozi focuses on "utility," Confucius focuses on whether an action is "should" or not "should," while Mozi focuses on the result of an action, whether it is beneficial or harmful. The distinction that I emphasized is actually the distinction between the so-called motivation theory and effect theory in the history of ethical thought. Both motivation theory and effect theory in the history of philosophy are one-sided propositions, but it is very clear that the former is idealistic thought and the latter is materialistic thought. In "A History of Chinese Philosophy," I praised Confucius and Mencius' motivation theory and ridiculed Mozi's effect theory as "overly calculating." This completely exposed my idealistic position.

Xunzi was one of the greatest materialists in ancient Chinese philosophy, but in terms of social thought, he still attempted to give religion a theoretical basis so that it could continue to play a role in anesthetizing the people. In "A History of Chinese Philosophy," my praise for Xunzi focused precisely on this part of his thought, rather than his materialist thought.

My "A History of Chinese Philosophy" Volume 1 still maintains a "detached" attitude on the surface, but in Volume 2, even on the surface, it is no longer "detached." I support the "orthodox" thought of feudal society, the thought of Cheng-Zhu, and combine it with the objective idealism of neo-realism. When talking about the most acute and fierce ideological struggle, my idealistic position is particularly obvious. For example, Dai Zhen's opposition to the Cheng-Zhu school of rationalism was a fierce struggle. Cheng-Zhu believed that the general could exist prior to the particular, that is, the so-called "principle comes first," which is the proposition of objective idealism. Dai Zhen believed that the general is in the particular and cannot exist prior to or apart from the particular, that is, the so-called "principle is in the matter," which is close to the proposition of dialectical materialism. On this issue, I openly stood on the position of Cheng-Zhu's objective idealism and criticized Dai Zhen's correct proposition ("A History of Chinese Philosophy," p. 995).

A prominent aspect of Dai Zhen's resistance to the Cheng-Zhu philosophy that served the feudal ruling class was the criticism of the distinction between "heavenly principle" and "human desire" made by the Cheng-Zhu philosophy. I stood on Cheng-Zhu's position and made a counter-criticism to Dai Zhen. I said: "If such debates are to have results, we must first clarify what the Song Confucians meant by human desire. The Song Confucians did not regard the desires of eating and drinking and sexual desire as evil, but only the improper desires of eating and drinking and sexual desire, in other words, the loss of desire, did the Song Confucians regard as evil" ("A History of Chinese Philosophy," p. 1005). In fact, the problem does not lie in what kind of definition the Song Confucians had for "human desire," but in what kind of concrete desires they specifically regarded as human desire. That is to say, what kind of concrete desires did the Song Confucians regard as "correct" and what kind of desires did they regard as "incorrect." Obviously, the peasants' desire to resist the landlord class must have been regarded by the Song Confucians as "incorrect," as "human desire" rather than "heavenly principle." In "A History of Chinese Philosophy," I did not promote the anti-resistance significance of Dai Zhen's opposition to the Song Confucians' "distinction between principle and desire" from this aspect. Instead, I only proved from the definition of "human desire" that "the distinction between right and wrong established by Dongyuan, upon careful examination, still has no significant difference from the distinction between principle and desire of the Song Confucians" ("A History of Chinese Philosophy," p. 1005). This is to defend Cheng-Zhu, that is, to defend the feudal ruling class.

In "A History of Chinese Philosophy," I superficially said that I want to have a sympathetic understanding of all schools, but in fact what I truly sympathize with is objective idealism and mysticism. Gongsun Long and Zhu Xi are both representatives of objective idealism, and both are whom I particularly praised and praised. Mencius and Zhuangzi are also representatives of mysticism, and both are whom I particularly praised. I believed that they separately pointed out the two methods of reaching the "mystical realm," and in the history of Chinese philosophy, they "divide and stand side by side, presenting a strange spectacle" ("A History of Chinese Philosophy," p. 304). During the Anti-Japanese War, I wrote several books on these corrupt idealistic thoughts and promoted them more vigorously.

During the Anti-Japanese War, I wrote a series of books flaunting the word "new." The specific content of the so-called "new" was the combination of corrupt feudalist philosophical thought and corrupt bourgeois thought. These books are actually an extension and continuation of "A History of Chinese Philosophy."

"New Rational Philosophy" elaborated on the objective idealism and agnostic thought that I praised in "A History of Chinese Philosophy." In "A History of Chinese Philosophy," I also advocated "scientific methods" on the surface and criticized the "metaphysicians" at the time. In fact, like all agnostics in the history of philosophy, when advocating science and scientific methods on the surface, it is not to deny mysticism, but to limit the scope of science and scientific methods, leaving a place for mysticism. I said, "Using intuition as a method, we can obtain a mystical experience," "An experience itself has no truth or falsehood." "The so-called intuition, epiphany, mystical experience, etc., although have very high value, but do not necessarily mix it into the method of philosophy" ("A History of Chinese Philosophy," pp. 4-5). This is an attempt to limit the scope of application of scientific methods so that it can coexist peacefully with mysticism. In "New Rational Philosophy," I more clearly limited the scope of science, opposed science to philosophy, and created an illusory object for philosophy, the so-called "true realm" or "realm of principle." This "world," as mentioned above, is actually the "heart" of God in religion. "New Treatise on Man" elaborated on the mystical thought that I praised in "A History of Chinese Philosophy," saying that the so-called "serving heaven," "enjoying heaven," and "being in harmony with heaven" are the most happy realms of man. The Chinese feudal philosophers regarded "heaven" as a most sublime concept and often gave it different interpretations. I also did this kind of "work," attempting to make it continue to play a religious role.

"New Treatise on the Way" is actually the "original form" of my "A History of Chinese Philosophy." "A History of Chinese Philosophy" wears the mask of objectivism, claiming to be "detached" and "neutral," treating all schools "equally." "New Treatise on the Way" throws away this mask, and proposes some philosophical schools that I truly sympathize with in "A History of Chinese Philosophy" as the "mainstream," while the rest are "broken harbors and cut-off rivers," and are ignored altogether. During the Anti-Japanese War, the class struggle in Chinese society was extremely sharp and fierce, and the ideological struggle reached the same degree. The mask was thrown away; the "original form" was also fully revealed.

In "New Treatise on the Way," I said that the entire history of Chinese philosophy is a "development" of a theme——"reaching the highest level of brilliance and adhering to the mean." In this "history of philosophy," I do not talk about the social origins of the various schools of Chinese philosophy, nor do I talk about their social significance. I only say that this "theme" exists there in isolation and develops in the air, and I crown my own set of ideas, which are called "new" but are actually corrupt, as the highest peak of the "development" of this "theme."

At this time, it was precisely the period when the class struggle in Chinese society reached an extremely sharp stage, and it was precisely the period when the revolutionary forces led by the Party and feudal imperialism were engaged in a decisive battle. At this time, propagating the extremely corrupt thought of "reaching the highest level of brilliance and adhering to the mean" meant teaching people to be content with the status quo and not to make revolution.

    过去哲学史工作底自我批判
    冯友兰
    编者按：冯友兰先生过去是我国旧哲学界的代表人物之一。他写的“中国哲学史”曾经是大学里流行的教本，而他在抗战时期写的“新理学”等书，则系统地建立和发挥了自己的哲学见解。这些书在解放前曾经在知识分子中产生过许多的影响。“北京大学学报（人文科学）”1956年第2期发表了冯友兰的自我批评的文章和汪子嵩的批评文章。现在把前一篇文章摘要发表在这里。我们认为在学术上采取这种批评和自我批评的方式是好的。
    在半封建半殖民地国家里，贯穿着资产阶级哲学思想的哲学史工作，就是资产阶级哲学思想跟封建主义哲学思想相联系的一种形式。
    我过去的中国哲学史工作，就是用一种资产阶级哲学思想，新实在主义底客观唯心主义跟中国封建社会底统治思想更密切地结合起来，使它在人民革命面前垂死底时候，来了一个“回光返照”。
    我标榜新实在主义，但我也并不是完全不要实用主义。我曾经企图把新实在主义和实用主义这两种同样腐朽的资产阶级哲学思想联系起来。唯心主义哲学本来都要倒向不可知论。由于我要保持跟实用主义的联系，所以在我过去的哲学思想中，不可知论的色彩，更加浓厚。不可知论之所以留一个“不可知”的东西，正是为宗教留一个“禁地”，为神秘主义开一个大门。我过去底哲学思想，也正是最后归结到神秘主义。
    所谓新实在主义的客观唯心主义，实用主义的不可知论，和宗教的神秘主义，这些都是我过去哲学思想中的资产阶级腐朽哲学底因素。我正是以这些因素为基础进行中国哲学史工作，以与中国封建主义哲学相结合。其意义是歪曲中国哲学史，掩盖阶级斗争，反对马克思主义的辩证唯物主义和历史唯物主义。
    哲学是社会上层建筑底一个组成部分，是阶级斗争底一个主要工具。它虽表现为某些哲学家底思想，但其实是某些社会阶级或阶层在经济和政治上的要求和愿望底反映。在“中国哲学史”里我引用实用主义底一个创始人詹姆士底说法，认为“哲学家各有其‘见’，又皆以其‘见’为根本意思，以之适用于各方面”（“中国哲学史”页12）。詹姆士所谓“见”本来是一个宗教的名词，宗教家有时有了一种幻觉，就自以为有了一种特别的能力，能与“神”相交通，因此有常人所不能有的知识。詹姆士用这个名词，使哲学神秘化。我在“中国哲学史”里引用这个名词，也把哲学神秘化，把它说成仅只是个人底“天才”底成果，而不是社会的产物，不是阶级斗争底工具。这种说法底本身恰好也就是为统治的剥削阶级服务的，恰好也就是一个阶级斗争底工具。
    后来在“新理学”里，我把这个神秘主义的思想，更加引申，因此也就把客观唯心主义底荒诞无稽，完全表现出来。在“新理学”里，我认为在没有作任何哲学思想之前，已经有所谓“本然的哲学系统”。在没有哲学上的各派别之前，已经有各派别底“本然系统”。程朱一派的客观唯心主义说“画前有易”，照我的解释，这就是说，在没有画八卦之前，已经有了八卦。
    这是“新理学”底尤其荒谬的一部分。“新理学”认为“飞机有飞机之理”。这并不错，错在认为“理在事先”，即在还没有飞机的时候，已有“飞机之理”。
    哲学史里有许多哲学派别。这是阶级社会里不同阶级和阶层底意识底表现。可是在“新理学”中，我宣称在实际上既然有各种不同的哲学系统，在虚无缥渺的所谓“形上方面”也应该有与之相应的各种的“本然哲学系统”。哲学家所谓“见”，就是有“见”于这些“本然系统”。哲学史上已有的每一种哲学系统，都应该跟它底“本然系统”相合，但是否果然相合，我们不能知道。我们只看它是否能“自圆其说，持之有故，言之成理”（“新理学”页235）。这是不可知论的说法。客观唯心主义，最后必归到不可知论，这就是一个例证。
    哲学史上的哲学家们为什么会有不同的“见”呢？在“中国哲学史”里，我又认为这是由于哲学家底性情气质底不同。我又引实用主义底一个创始人詹姆士底意见，认为“依哲学家之性情气质，可将其分为二类：为软心的哲学家和硬心的哲学家”。在“中国哲学史”讲到荀子的时候，我就用这种荒谬的说法，解释荀子与孟子所以不同。我说：“孟子乃软心的哲学家，其哲学有唯心论的倾向。荀子为硬心的哲学家，其哲学有唯物论的倾向”（“中国哲学史”页352）。照这种荒谬的说法，在中国哲学史里，孟子、荀子所代表的两个对立斗争的唯心主义的和唯物主义的系统，其出现只是出于偶然。假使没有像孟子那样“软心的”人，也就没有像他所代表的唯心主义的系统。假使没有像荀子那样“硬心的”人，也就没有像他所代表的唯物主义的系统。这样，哲学史底发展，就完全是些偶然事情底堆积，没有规律，也不可能有规律。这种说法是完全跟历史唯物主义相对立的。
    唯物主义与唯心主义是哲学中的两大阵营。唯物主义思想经常跟社会底进步阶级相联系；唯心主义思想经常跟反动阶级相联系。这是阶级斗争在思想中的反映，也是哲学史发展底规律。就中国哲学史说，孟子是拥护当时的世袭贵族的，他认为有主宰世界的“天”即上帝，宣传“君权神授”等唯心主义的学说。荀子是新兴地主阶级底代言人，宣传唯物主义世界观，反对宗教，对于孟子，有尖锐的批评。这种思想斗争，是先秦哲学发展底规律底具体表现，绝不是偶然的。
    “中国哲学史”出版以后，我又出了一部“中国哲学史补”，对于先秦诸子底起源，提出了另一套的荒谬的说法，企图混淆历史唯物主义。照这个说法，我认为先秦哲学不同的派别，出于不同的职业。例如儒家出于掌握古代文化的儒士。墨家出于制造武器的武士。先秦六家出于六种职业。它们底思想不同，是它们底不同职业底不同道德和行为底反映。这是企图用社会上的职业分工，说明哲学史中的派别纷歧，以替代马克思主义用社会阶级斗争说明哲学史中的“两军对垒”底正确理论。
    在“中国哲学史”里我认为一种学说，有其“内在的价值”，那就是说，如果一种学说有价值，它底价值就在于它的本身，在于它底本身自成为一个理论系统。这是用一种唯心主义观点以反对马克思主义的反映论。马克思主义的反映论认为一种学说，如果有一定的价值，其价值就在于它本身在一定程度上正确地反映客观实在，在社会科学方面，还在于它在一定程度上反映当时社会经济向前发展底需要和人民群众底利益。
    一种有价值的哲学必是一种理论系统，这是当然的。但其是一种理论系统，是一种现象。其本质是它在一定程度上反映客观实在。能在一定程度上反映客观实在的哲学，必是一种理论系统，但是一种理论系统，不一定都反映客观的实在。照我底这种“本末倒置”的看法，一家哲学底价值底大小，在于它底理论系统是否完整细密，不问其反映客观实在达到何种程度。因为照我底不可知论的观点，我们除了看一种哲学是否“持之有故，言之成理”外，没有别的方法决定它是否反映客观实在。
    哲学史上有许多理论系统，其内容完全相反。因此，在“中国哲学史”里，我就得出结论说：哲学本来是跟科学不相似，而跟文学宗教相似。哲学本来就是“公说公有理，婆说婆有理”的学问。
    我写“中国哲学史”底时候，我就用了这种“超然态度”。我把资产阶级的客观主义，说成是科学底客观态度。我宣称一个好的哲学史家，在讲那一家哲学底时候，就要站在这一家的立场，把他底思想用同情的态度重想一遍，然后不增不减地加以叙述。这样的处理，就是使唯心主义的思想和唯物主义的思想，混而不分。在“中国哲学史”里，我也不分别那个哲学派别是唯心主义的，那一个哲学派别是唯物主义的。各派别之间的互相批判，无论如何激烈，都被说成是由于哲学家底所“见”不同。
    资产阶级隐瞒它底立场，用以欺骗人民群众。客观主义就是它隐瞒立场底一个方法。立场是隐瞒不住的。在“中国哲学史”里，我表面上说是认为各家各派都有“贡献”，要把他们底“贡献”，都叙述出来，其实站在我过去的唯心主义底立场上，真正的贡献，是看不见的，也不可能看见的。我表面上说是对于各家各派，都取“超然”、“中立”的态度，“一视同仁”，但是实际上是有褒贬抑扬的。关于孔子和墨子底思想的叙述，就是一个很好的例证。
    孔子在基本上是唯心主义者，但是他底教育思想教人多见多闻，从感觉经验中获得知识。他强调学习，教人从学习中累积知识。这是一种唯物主义的观点。在中国哲学史里，墨子首先自觉地提出真理标准底问题，提出“三表”作为衡量一切思想言论是否正确底标准。他认为正确的思想和言论，必须有历史上的根据，要符合人民群众底感觉经验，最后还要在政治实践上加以试验，看它是否合乎国家和人民底利益。这也是唯物主义的观点，可是这些观点，我或者简直没有提到，或者仅只提到。
    在“中国哲学史”里，孔子与墨子底主要区别，我认为在于孔子注重“仁义”，而墨子注重“功利”，孔子注重行为底“应该”或不“应该”，而墨子注重行为底结果，有利或有害。我所强调的这个分别，其实就是伦理思想史中所谓动机论与效果论底分别。哲学史上的动机论和效果论都是片面的主张，但是前者是唯心主义的思想，后者是唯物主义的思想，则是很清楚的。在“中国哲学史”里，我表扬孔子及以后孟子底动机论，而讥讽墨子底效果论为“过于算帐”。这就完全暴露了我底唯心主义的立场。
    荀子是中国古代哲学中的一个最大的唯物论者，但是在社会思想方面，他还是企图给宗教一种理论基础，使它能继续发生麻醉人民底作用。在“中国哲学史”里，我对于荀子的赞扬，正是注重在他的思想中的这一部分，而不是他底唯物主义思想。
    我底“中国哲学史”上卷，还在表面上维持“超然的”态度，可是在下卷里，即使在表面上看，也就不“超然”了。我拥护封建社会“正统”思想，程朱底思想，并且使它跟新实在主义底客观唯心主义，配合起来。在讲到思想斗争最尖锐剧烈底时候，我底唯心主义底立场，就尤其明显。例如戴震反对程朱理学是一场剧烈的斗争。程朱认为一般可以先于特殊而存在，即所谓“理在事先”，这是客观唯心主义的主张。戴震认为一般在特殊之中，不能先于或离开特殊而存在，即所谓“理在事中”，这是接近辩证唯物主义的主张。对于这个问题，我公开地站在程朱底客观唯心主义底立场，批判戴震底正确的主张（“中国哲学史”页995）。
    戴震反抗为封建统治阶级服务的程朱哲学的一个突出的方面，就是批判程朱哲学所作的“天理”“人欲”之分。我站在程朱底立场对戴震提出反批评。我说：“此等辩论如有结果，须先明宋儒所谓人欲是何所指。饮食男女之欲，宋儒并不以为恶，特饮食男女之欲之不正者，换言之，即欲之失者，宋儒始以为恶耳”（“中国哲学史”页1005）。其实问题并不在于宋儒对于“人欲”有什么样的定义，而在于他们具体地把什么样的具体欲望算作人欲。也就是说，宋儒把什么样具体的欲望算作“正”，什么算作“不正”。显然农民反抗地主阶级的欲望，宋儒一定认为是“不正”的，是“人欲”不是“天理”。我在“中国哲学史”里，不从这一方面，发扬戴震反对宋儒底“理欲之分”底具有反抗性的意义。而只是从“人欲”底定义上证明“东原所立邪正之分，细察之，与宋儒理欲之分，仍无显著的分别”（“中国哲学史”页1005）。这是为程朱辩护，也就是为封建统治阶级辩护。
    在“中国哲学史”里，我表面上说是对于各家各派，都要有同情的了解，其实我真正同情的，是客观唯心主义和神秘主义。公孙龙和朱熹都是客观唯心主义底代表人物，都是我所特别表彰赞扬的。孟子和庄子也都是神秘主义底代表人物，也都是我所特别赞扬的。我认为他们分别地指出了达到“神秘境界”的两个方法，在中国哲学史中“分流并峙，颇呈奇观”（“中国哲学史”，页304）。这些腐朽的唯心主义思想，在抗日战争时期我写了几本书，更用力地加以宣传。
    在抗日战争期间，我写了一系列的以“新”字为标榜的书，其所谓“新”底具体内容就是腐朽的封建主义哲学思想跟腐朽的资产阶级思想底结合。这些书其实就是“中国哲学史”底延长和继续。
      “新理学”发挥了我在“中国哲学史”里所表扬的客观唯心主义和不可知论思想。在“中国哲学史”里，我在表面上也提倡“科学方法”，批判了当时的“玄学家”，其实，正如哲学史上一切的不可知论者一样，在表面上提倡科学和科学方法底时候，并不是否认神秘主义，而是限制科学和科学方法底范围，为神秘主义留一地位。我说“以直觉为方法，吾人可得到一种神秘的经验”，“一个经验之本身，无所谓真妄”。“所谓直觉，顿悟，神秘经验等，虽有甚高的价值，但不必以之混入哲学方法之内”（“中国哲学史”，页4—5）。这就是企图限制科学方法底应用范围，使它跟神秘主义和平共处。在“新理学”里，我更明显地把科学底范围，加以限制，把科学与哲学对立起来，为哲学创立了一个虚幻的对象，即所谓“真际”或“理世界”。这个“世界”，如上面所说的，其实就是宗教中的上帝底“心”。“新原人”发挥了我在“中国哲学史”所表扬的神秘主义思想，把所谓“事天”“乐天”“同天”说成是人底最幸福的境界。中国的封建哲学家，把“天”当成是一个最崇高的观念，经常给它以不同的解释。我也作了这一类的“工作”，企图使它能继续发生宗教底作用。
      “新原道”其实就是我底“中国哲学史”底“原形”，“中国哲学史”带着客观主义底假面具，号称“超然”“中立”，对于各家各派“一视同仁”。“新原道”扔开了这个假面具，把我在“中国哲学史”里所真正同情的一些哲学派别提出来作为“主流”，其余都是“断港绝河”，一概置之不理。在抗日战争时期，中国社会底阶级斗争，极其尖锐激烈，思想斗争也达到同样的程度。假面具扔开了；“原形”也就毕露了。
    在“新原道”里，我把整个的中国哲学史，说成是一个主题——“极高明而道中庸”——底“发展”。在这部“哲学史”里，我不讲中国各派哲学底社会根源，也不讲它们底社会意义，只说有这个“主题”孤另另地悬空地在那里“发展”，并且把我自己的一套号称为“新”，而其实是腐朽的思想，自封为这一个“主题”底“发展”底最高峰。
    这个时候正是中国社会阶级斗争达到极其尖锐的时期，正是党所领导的革命力量与封建主义帝国主义进行决战底时期。在这时候宣传“极高明而道中庸”这一个极腐朽的思想，其意义就是教人安于现状，不要革命。
