    Cannot Be So Careless
    To the Editor:
    Not long ago, the Organization Department of the Zhengzhou Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China received a phone call from the Party Committee of the Zhengzhou Power Plant, saying: "Your letter introduces Tang Jianghai and Wang Shengchun as Party members, but according to them, they are not Party members. Please verify." The person who answered the phone didn't believe such a thing could happen. However, upon investigation, it turned out that the Henan Military Region Training Corps had mistakenly introduced Tang Jianghai and others as Party members to the Zhengzhou Municipal Committee Organization Department, which then forwarded it to the power plant.

    This kind of careless mistake in transferring Party membership is not an isolated case. In the past two months, the Zhengzhou Municipal Committee Organization Department has discovered several such instances: A letter from the Changshu Municipal Committee Organization Department in Jiangsu also mistakenly identified a non-Party member as a Party member, and the Zhoukou Municipal Committee Organization Department in Henan Province introduced probationary Party member Lü Fushan to the Zhengzhou Municipal Committee Organization Department as a full Party member.

    Another manifestation of carelessness in transferring Party membership is misspelling names. In one instance, the Feixi County Committee Organization Department misspelled four names in the Party membership transfers they sent. They wrote "Wang Xinmin" as "Wang Xingming," "Liu Jiaming" as "Liu Xueming," and so on.

    These phenomena not only create a lot of trouble for the Party committees receiving Party membership transfers but also potentially cause serious losses to the Party. Therefore, Party organization departments must be serious and conscientious when introducing Party membership.

### 不能这样马虎

    不能这样马虎编辑同志：
    不久前，中共郑州市委组织部接到郑州电厂党委会这样一个电话：“你们来信介绍唐江海、王生春是党员，可是据他们自己说不是党员。请查对。”接电话的人不相信会发生这样的事情。可是一经查对，原来是河南军区训练团误把唐江海等当成党员介绍给郑州市委组织部，郑州市委组织部也就照转给电厂。
    这种粗枝大叶转错党员关系的事情，并不是个别的。郑州市委组织部近两个月来就发现了这样几件事情：江苏常熟市委组织部来信同样把一位非党员当成了党员，河南省周口市委组织部把候补党员吕富山当成正式党员介绍给郑州市委组织部。
    在转递党员关系中的另一种粗枝大叶的表现，是写错姓名。肥西县委组织部某次转来的党员关系中，就写错过四个名字。他们把“王新民”写成“王兴明”，“刘家明”写成“刘穴明”……。
    这些现象不但给接受党员关系的党委增加了不少麻烦，而且有可能给党造成严重的损失。因此，党委组织部在介绍党员关系时，一定要严肃认真。
