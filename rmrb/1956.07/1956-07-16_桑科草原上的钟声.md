    The Bell Sounds on the Sangke Grassland
    By Our Special Correspondent Han Beiping
    We left the Labrang Monastery and headed for the Sangke Grassland.

    The northern side of the Sangke Grassland is a range of continuous high mountains. This side of the mountains is Gansu Province, and the other side is Qinghai Province.

    How beautiful the grassland is! The tamarisks on the grassland have burst forth with tender leaves, and the pasture grass raises its head from the severe cold. The "Sulu" stubbornly stretches its branches. On the boundless horizon, flocks of sheep and cattle are densely scattered like stars. At the foot of the mountains are the white felt tents and black yak hair tents of the herders. Flocks of sheep gallop across the mountainside, as if a pile of white clouds is being blown by the wind, so light and soft. The Tibetan people, wearing red and purple robes, or old sheepskin robes, ride on swift horses, and in the blink of an eye, they run from a distant place to our side, and then run away again. The Xiahe River meanders around the grassland like a glass ribbon, making a crisp sound when it encounters obstructing pebbles.

    On this high and vast grassland, a bell suddenly rang. The bell sound gently rippled out, not only did it not break the tranquility of the grassland, but it added to the sense of emptiness and vastness of the grassland. It sounded both cordial and surprising to us.

    The bell sound came from the Cadre School of the Gannan Work Committee of the Chinese Communist Party.

    The school buildings are built on the grassland, surrounded by earthen walls, looking very much like ancient castles. We walked into the school and heard a burst of loud reading. At first, I thought the Tibetan compatriots were chanting scriptures, but later I learned that they were learning the Tibetan language, loudly reciting Tibetan alphabets and phonetic spellings. Handsomely dressed Tibetan young men and women sat in classrooms, on the playground, and under the shade of trees, concentrating on their studies. Their focused expressions made people afraid to disturb them.

    The Gannan Cadre School was established in November 1954, and six cohorts of students have now graduated. The training is aimed at ethnic minority cadres and active elements among the masses. Currently, there are three training classes in session: a political training class, a Tibetan language class, and an animal husbandry class, with a total of 220 students.

    The head of the school, Zhang Fengshan, a shepherd boy from the foot of the Daqing Mountains, couldn't bear the oppression and exploitation of the landlords, stole two steamed buns as travel expenses, and embarked on the revolutionary road. In the cavalry unit, this little guy, who was too young and too short to even get on a horse, finally trained to become a commander, holding a saber high and galloping inside and outside the Great Wall, spending the arduous years of the Anti-Japanese War and the Liberation War. Like everyone who grew up in the revolutionary army, he was nurtured by the Party, and at the same time, under the Party's education and enlightenment, he opened the door to wisdom. His desire for knowledge and class consciousness grew together. In the most difficult days, when he was a confidential communications officer, he read documents and newspapers word by word. Now he is not only an educational administrator but also a theory instructor in Gannan. When he was first transferred from the army to his current position, it was not without difficulties. He didn't know how to do educational work, and even though he had a full belly of enthusiasm, he had nowhere to use it. However, he had an important principle: "Since it is a task assigned to me by the Party, I must complete it no matter what!" Under the leadership of the higher Party committee and his own exploration, he completed six training courses and gained experience. Now he has fallen in love with this work, and has fallen in love with the grassland. As long as a person develops a love for his work, no matter how great the difficulties, or how lonely the place, joy will emerge. During the day, he teaches students; at night, he helps students direct plays, pointing and gesticulating on stage, and then going offstage to play the erhu; laughter resounds in the night sky of the grassland. Who can say that this is a lonely place?

    Jia Yang Weizhu (his Han Chinese name is Luo Faxi), the head teacher of the Tibetan language class, is a Zhangyi Yuanba (his Han Chinese meaning is equivalent to deputy secretary-general) of Labrang Monastery, and still wears a cassock. However, under the influence of the Party's ethnic minority policy, he teaches Tibetan, which was previously only studied in temples, to herders and farmers who have never been exposed to writing. In addition to scriptures, he has also dabbled in social science books, and at appropriate times, he can quote classical works of Marxism-Leninism. On his desk, I saw the Selected Works of Mao Zedong and Dialectical Materialism.

    Among the students, the first person I met was Tari Mao. The first day I walked into the school's square, I saw a chubby woman walking back and forth next to a house, holding a textbook in her hand, looking at it, and immediately hiding it behind her back, reciting it in a very loud voice, as if she was the only person in this courtyard. The next morning, before I even got out of bed, the sound of phonetic review came from outside the window. Although I don't understand Tibetan, I could still tell from the high-pitched and musical tone that it was Tari Mao reading. She is from Wai Xiang Tawa, Maqu County, originally from Qinghai. Because her family was poor, she was given to others to raise. At the age of seven, she drifted to Gansu, and then moved back and forth between the pastoral areas and temple locations on the border of Gansu and Qinghai, working as a foster daughter and doing hard labor. After liberation, she personally experienced the tremendous changes in the Tibetan areas, and admired the Communist Party and loved the working cadres from the bottom of her heart. She secretly took the cadres as an example and actively did everything. At the Maqu County government, she washed clothes for the cadres, and even though she only had a small income, she did it with enthusiasm. Later, she also served as the head of the transportation station's moving group, and was an active element among the masses.

    Tari Mao asked for work, and asked for learning. I asked her: "Why do you want to participate in work?" Her round face flushed, and she solemnly replied without thinking: "I want to work for the people, for socialism!"

    After Tari Mao came to school, she went to bed later than others, got up earlier than others, didn't rest at noon, and sometimes, afraid of disturbing others, she ran to the grassland alone to recite her textbook.

    Now she is learning very well and can also help others study. A person without culture has mastered culture; a person who has always been manipulated by others has taken control of her own destiny. From Tari Mao, we can see the changes of a nation.

    "What will happen after studying?" I once asked her this. She replied just as solemnly: "I want to work in our Tibetan area, I can go anywhere!"

    Wa Aza, a tall and strong herder from the Shangdiebu tribe in Zhuoni County, is a twenty-six year old, like an untamed horse, grew up on the grassland and was tempered in nomadic life, with a forthright and daring personality. From the age of seven to fourteen, he worked as a lama in a monastery. At the age of fifteen, he and the men of his banner went four or five hundred miles away to rob the horse herds of other tribes. He walked at the front, and when he encountered the Kuomintang bandits on the road, he shot one down with one shot. In the armed conflicts between tribes, he was also the person who fought in the front.

    Now, the Wa Aza sitting in front of me is a gentle and cheerful person. Although the brave customs of the grassland are still preserved, the direction of development is different.

    When he first came to school, his saddle was replaced with a stool, his tent was replaced with a dormitory, and tea and boiled water replaced milk and wine, which made him very unaccustomed. All the learning and living systems seemed to him to be constraints. Sometimes he went out to drink, and came back drunk. The teacher asked him why he didn't ask for leave? He was very surprised, and said: "Why do I have to ask for leave? We haven't even asked our enemies or fathers for leave!" However, after studying for a period of time, he began to change. Except for Saturdays and Sundays when he still drank a little wine, the rest of the days, he was a very disciplined student, and didn't even leave the school gate. But when he learned that one of his best friends was secretly going to some disreputable places, he exposed it in public and criticized it severely. Doing so violated the customs of the herders, but he said: "This is the strength that the Communist Party gave me, so I can criticize him."

    Now, this herder who originally couldn't read a word can read newspapers, write letters home, understand simple scientific books about animal husbandry, and can talk to me in Chinese. More importantly, he has gradually progressed in his thinking and politics, and is slowly maturing. As our conversation was about to end, his voice suddenly lowered, but he couldn't hide his excitement. He said: "I don't know if I meet the requirements for joining the Party, but I know that there is no way without the leadership of the Party." He was right. We all believe that he will become a communist fighter.

    I would like to mention another person, and he is a different type from Tari Mao and Wa Aza. His name is Dorje Tsering, from Zhuogai, District Four, Xiahe County. He is not a herder but a Tibetan farmer from the mountainous area. This eighteen-year-old young man is very shy when talking to people, and doesn't know where to put his hands, but he has a stubborn energy that he will never give up until he achieves his goal.

    Last July, Dorje Tsering was only seventeen years old. He hid it from his family and ran to the District Committee with two other young men to ask for work. The District Party Secretary said: You have to go through the township organization and seek the consent of your family. He pretended to go home, stole buttered tea, zanba and luggage, and said naively: "If they don't agree, how could they give me these things?" The District Party Secretary, looking at this pure young man, found him both funny and lovable, and didn't know what work to assign him for a while, so he decided to send him to study. Do you think he is naughty, naive, or impulsive? No, there is a respectable belief that supports him, he said: "I am a suffering person, I hate the ruling class, I must work for the people, you can ask me to feed the horses, I am also willing!"

    On the grassland at an altitude of more than 3,000 meters, it is still very cold outdoors, but as I listened to these touching stories, I felt warm in my heart. The Party's ethnic minority policy is like the spring breeze turning into rain, and the hardworking and capable Tibetans have received loving care, and will produce their own fighters with a communist worldview. Moreover, now in the Gannan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, a large number of ethnic minority cadres have been trained. Taking the six counties of the autonomous prefecture as an example, there are five Tibetan deputy secretaries of the county party committee and thirteen deputy county magistrates. Cadres below the county level are emerging by the hundreds and thousands.

    The bell on the Sangke Grassland is a note in the joyful melody, it echoes the music from all over the country, jointly playing the socialist march of the motherland.

    桑科草原上的钟声
    本报特约记者  韩北屏
    我们离开拉卜楞寺，走向桑科草原。
    桑科草原的北面，是一列连绵的高山，山这边是甘肃省，山那边就是青海省了。
    草原多么美啊！草原上的柽柳绽开了嫩叶，牧草从严寒下昂起头来，“苏鲁”倔强地伸展着枝桠；一望无际的地平线上，羊群牛群像繁星似地密布着；山脚下扎有牧民的白色毡帐篷和黑色牛毛帐篷；山腰上羊群奔驰而过，仿佛一堆白云被风吹动，那样轻捷，那样柔软。穿着红色紫色的长袍，或者穿着老羊皮板长袍的藏民，骑在骏马上，一?眼就从老远的地方跑到身边，又从身边跑开去了。大夏河像玻璃带子一般的绕着草原，遇到挡路的石子，发出清脆的响声。
    在这天高地广的草原上，忽然传来一阵钟声。钟声轻轻的荡漾开去，不但没有打破草原的宁静，反倒增加了草原的空廓和辽阔之感，听上去又亲切又使我们惊异。
    这钟声是从中共甘南工委干部学校发出来的。
    学校校舍建筑在草原上，四围有土墙，样子很像古代的城堡。我们走进学校，听见一片琅琅诵读声，起初我还以为是藏族同胞在念经，后来才知道他们在学习藏文，高声背诵藏文字母和拼音。穿戴华美多彩的藏族男女青年，坐在课室、操场和树荫下，专心一意地在读书，那种全神贯注的神情，使人不敢打搅他们。
    甘南干校从1954年11月建校，到现在有六期学员毕业了。训练对象是民族干部和群众中的积极分子。目前还有三个训练班正在学习着，一个是政治训练班，一个是藏文班，一个是畜牧班，共有二百二十人。
    学校的负责人张凤山，大青山下的牧羊娃，曾经受不住地主的压迫和剥削，偷了两个馍馍当路费，走上了革命的道路。在骑兵部队中，这个年纪太小，个子太矮，连上马也感到困难的小鬼，终于锻炼成指挥员，高举着马刀，驰骋于长城内外，度过抗日战争和解放战争的艰苦岁月。正像一切在革命部队长大的人一样，他受了党的培养，同时也在党的教育和启发之下，打开了智慧的大门，他的求知欲和阶级觉悟一同增长。在最困难的日子里，在当机要通讯员的时候，他就逐字逐句地读文件读报纸。现在他已经不仅是教育行政工作者，而且是甘南的理论教员。当他刚由部队调到现在的岗位上的时候，并不是没有困难的。他不懂得教育工作该怎么做，纵然有满腔热情也没处使。可是，对于他有一条重要的原则：“既然是党交给自己的任务，怎么样也得完成！”他就在上级党的领导和自己的摸索之下，办完了六期训练班，取得了经验。现在他爱上了这个工作，爱上了草原。一个人只要对工作产生了爱，再大的困难也能克服，再寂寞的地方，也能涌现出欢乐。白天，他给学生上课；夜晚，他帮助学生导演戏剧，一会儿上台指指点点，一会儿又到台下去拉胡琴；草原的夜空中，震响着欢笑。谁能说这儿是寂寞的地方呢？
    藏文班班主任嘉样伟珠（汉文名字是罗法西），是拉卜楞寺的章议原巴（汉文意思相当于副秘书长），现在还披着袈裟。可是，他在党的民族政策的感召下，把过去只有在寺院里才学习的藏文，教给从来没有接触过文字的牧民和农民，而他自己在经文之外，也涉猎了社会科学书籍，在适当的时候，他已能引用马列主义的经典著作。我在他的书桌上，看到毛泽东选集和辩证唯物论。
    学员中间，我第一个认识的是塔日茂。我第一天走进学校的广场，就看见一个胖胖的女人，在屋子旁边走来走去，手上拿着课本，看一眼，马上又藏到背后，用非常响亮的声音背诵着，好像这个院子里只有她一个人。第二天早上，我还没有起床，窗户外边又传来了拼音复习的声音，我虽然不懂藏话，可是从那高昂而富有音乐性的声调，仍然可以分辨出这是塔日茂在读书。她是玛曲县外相塔洼人，原籍青海，因家贫送给别人抚养，七岁时流落到甘肃来，之后就在甘、青两省的边界牧区和寺院所在地转来转去，当养女、做苦工。解放以后，她亲身经历了藏区的巨大变革，从心里敬佩共产党，爱工作干部，她暗中以干部做榜样，什么事情都积极去干。在玛曲县政府替干部洗衣服，只有微少的收入，她同样干得兴致勃勃。后来又担任了运输站的搬运小组长，是群众中间的积极分子。
    塔日茂要求工作，要求学习。我问她：“你为什么要参加工作？”她圆胖的脸上泛着红光，毫不考虑地庄严地回答：“我要为人民工作，为社会主义工作！”
    塔日茂来到学校之后，比别人睡得晚，比别人起得早，中午不休息，有时候怕惊动别人，独自跑到草原上去背诵课本。
    现在她自己学得很好，还能帮助别人学习。一个没有文化的人，掌握了文化；一个从来受别人摆布的人，掌握了自己的命运。从塔日茂身上，可以看出一个民族的变化。
    “学习之后怎么样呢？”我曾经这样问她。她同样庄严地回答：“我要在我们藏区工作，到哪儿都可以！”
    卓尼县上叠布部落的瓦阿扎，二十六岁的高大强壮的牧民，像一匹无羁的骏马，在草原上长大，在游牧生活中受了锻炼，性格豪爽，敢作敢为。他从七岁到十四岁，在寺院里当过喇嘛。十五岁就和自己同旗的男子们，到四、五百里外去抢别的部落的马群，他走在最前头，路上遇到国民党的匪军，他一枪就撂倒一个。在部落与部落的械斗中，他也是打前锋的人。
    现在呢，坐在我面前的瓦阿扎，却是一个文静而开朗的人，勇敢的草原风习，虽然还保存着，但发展的方向可不一样了。
    他初来学校的时候，马鞍换了板凳，帐篷换了宿舍，茶和开水代替了牛奶和酒，使他十分不习惯。一切学习和生活的制度，在他看来都是束缚。有时出去喝酒，醉醺醺地回来。教师问他为什么不请假？他非常诧异，就道：“干吗要请假？我们对头人和父亲也没有请过假！”然而，当他学习了一个时期之后，开始转变了，除了星期六和星期天仍然喝一点酒外，其余的日子，是一个很规矩的学生，连校门也不出。但当他的一个最好的朋友，背着人到一些不名誉的地方去被他知道以后，就当众揭露，并严厉批评。这样做，是违反牧民的习惯的，可是，他说：“这是共产党给我的力量，我才能批评他。”
    现在，这个原来一字不识的牧民已经能看报纸，写家信，看懂有关畜牧的浅近科学书籍，能够用汉话和我交谈，更重要的，是他在思想上和政治上的逐渐进步，慢慢成熟。当我们谈话快结束时，他的声音突然放低了，可是掩盖不住他的激动，他说：“我的入党条件够不够，我不知道，但是，我知道没有党的领导没办法。”他说得对。我们大家都相信他会成为共产主义的战士的。
    我还要再提出一个人来，他和塔日茂、瓦阿扎是不同的类型。他叫多吉才让，夏河县四区卓盖人，不是牧民而是山区的藏族农民。这个十八岁的年轻小伙子，和人说起话来腼腆得很，两只手不知放在哪里才好，但是，他有一股执拗的劲儿，不达目的决不罢休。
    去年七月，多吉才让刚刚十七岁，他瞒着家里，和另外两个青年，跑到区委会要求工作，区委书记说：你要通过乡的组织，征求家庭的同意才行。他假装着回家一趟，偷了酥油糌粑和行李来，天真地说：“他们不同意，怎么会把东西给我呢？”区委书记对着这个纯洁的青年，觉得又可笑又可爱，一时不知分配什么工作，就决定送他来学习了。你说他是顽皮、天真，或是冲动吗？不，有一个可敬的信念在支持着他，他说：“我是受苦的人，恨统治阶级，我一定要为人民工作，你们叫我喂马，我也心甘情愿！”
    在海拔三千多公尺的草原上，室外还很冷，但是，我听着这些动人的故事，心里觉得暖洋洋的。党的民族政策有如春风化雨，勤劳而干练的藏族，受到了慈爱的抚育，将产生他们自己的具有共产主义世界观的战士。而且，现在在甘南藏族自治州中，已经培养了大批民族干部，就以自治州的六个县来说，便有藏族县委正副书记五人，正副县长十三人，县级以下的干部，更是以百计以千计的涌现出来。
    桑科草原上的钟声，是欢乐的乐曲中的一个音符，它和全国各地的乐声应和着，合奏出祖国的社会主义进行曲。
