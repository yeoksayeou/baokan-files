    Xiangtan Special District Agricultural Cooperatives Conduct Summer Harvest Advance Distribution
    Increasing Members' Enthusiasm for Production
    Some Cooperatives Did Not Implement the Principle of "Less Deduction, More Points," and Attention Should Be Paid to Rectification
    (Our Newspaper) According to news reports, over 80% of the 17,000-plus agricultural cooperatives in Xiangtan Special District, Hunan Province, have conducted one or two advance distributions of cash income earned from spring and summer harvests and sideline businesses. Most of the cooperatives that have made advance distributions have conscientiously implemented the principle of "less deduction, more points." According to statistics from 4,655 cooperatives in seven counties, including Yueyang, Liuyang, Pingjiang, Xiangyin, Chaling, Wangcheng, and Changsha, 2,348 cooperatives made advance distributions based on the number of work points earned by members, with appropriate consideration given to their actual needs. The advance distributions in these cooperatives have further promoted the development of production and diversified operations. For example, the Yexin Cooperative in Yunyang Township, Chaling County, earned a total of 2,450 yuan in cash and immediately allocated 2,150 yuan to its 108 member households based on work points. At the same time, with the consent of all members, it also allocated 92 yuan to provide targeted assistance to households in difficulty. This pleased the members greatly. The number of people working each day increased from 80 to 150.
    However, in the work of advance distribution, a considerable number of cooperatives did not conscientiously implement the principle of "to each according to his work," but simply practiced focused advance distribution, that is, only providing for members in difficulty, or distributing evenly by population or by household. Among the 4,655 cooperatives that had made advance distributions in the seven counties of Changsha, Liuyang, and others, 2,128 cooperatives practiced focused advance distribution, and 179 cooperatives made average advance distributions by household or by population. For example, the advance distribution principle proposed by the Yong'an First Cooperative in Liuyang was: "If you have money and rice, no advance; if you have money but no rice, take money to buy wheat from the cooperative; if you have rice (unified purchase rice not yet bought back) but no money, advance money to buy rice; if you have neither rice nor money, advance money and wheat." The principle proposed by the Yuan Gang Fifth Cooperative was: "Advance more to those with greater shortages, advance less to those with fewer shortages, and no advance to those with no shortages."
    Some cooperatives neglected the principle of "less deduction, more points," and only emphasized solving the cooperative's financial difficulties. Consequently, they set aside a large proportion of income and advanced only a small proportion to members, which could only lead to focused advance distributions. The 1,642 cooperatives in Liuyang earned a total of 3.56 million yuan in cash, but only advanced 1.445 million yuan to members, resulting in the adoption of focused advance distribution methods.
    The failure of these cooperatives to correctly implement the principles of "to each according to his work" and "less deduction, more points" has affected members' enthusiasm for labor and the unity among middle peasants. Many middle-peasant members, because they did not receive an advance, began to doubt the principle of "to each according to his work" and were not enthusiastic about working. The Shengli Cooperative in Guankuang Township, Pingjiang, had 214 member households, and 75 middle-peasant households did not receive anything in advance. They were very dissatisfied and their production morale was low. They said: "We are told to work every day, but we get no money. What's the point of working?" In individual cooperatives, due to unreasonable advance distributions, some members resorted to grabbing cooperative property. For example, Cao Ruiqian, a member of the Futan Cooperative in Liuyang, was given 40 yuan by the cooperative to buy pigs, but he neither bought pigs nor handed the money back.

    湘潭专区农业社进行夏收预支分配
    提高了社员生产热情
    部分社没有执行少扣多分的原则要注意改正
    本报讯　湖南省湘潭专区一万七千多个农业合作社，已有80％以上的社将春夏收作物和经营副业赚来的现金收入进行了一次至二次预支分配。已预支的社大多数贯彻执行了少扣多分的原则。根据岳阳、浏阳、平江、湘阴、茶陵、望城、长沙等七个县4，655个社的统计，按社员所得工分多少并适当照顾到社员实际需要进行预支的有2，348个社。这些社的预支分配进一步推动了生产和多种经营的开展。如茶陵县云阳乡业心社共收入2，450元现金，即抽出2，150元按工分预支给全社108户社员，同时，经过全体社员同意，又抽出九十二元有重点地照顾困难户。这样社员都很满意。全社每天出工由八十人增加到一百五十人。
    但是在预支工作中，也有相当一部分合作社没有贯彻执行按劳取酬的原则，而是单纯地实行重点预支，即只支给困难社员或者按人口、按户平均分配。长沙、浏阳等七个县4，655个已预支的社中，实行重点预支的2，128个社，按户或按人口平均预支的179个社。如浏阳永安一社提出的预支原则是：有钱有米不支，有钱无米拿钱向社买麦子，有米（统销米未买回）无钱支钱买米，无米无钱支钱支麦子。袁纲五社提出的原则是缺多多支，缺少少支，不缺不支。
    有些社忽视了少扣多分的原则，只强调解决社的资金困难，因而收入多预支少，结果只能实行重点预支。浏阳1，642个社共收入356万元现金，但只预支了一百四十四万五千元给社员，结果都采用重点预支的办法。
    这些社由于没有正确执行按劳取酬、少扣多分的原则，已使社员的劳动积极性和中农间的团结受到影响。许多中农社员因为没有预支，对按劳取酬的原则发生了怀疑，出工不积极。平江观圹乡胜利社214户社员，有七十五户中农社员没有预支到东西，很不满意，生产情绪低落。他们说：出工天天喊，支钱没一点，还出工干什么。个别社因预支不合理，有的社员对社的财产采取抓一把的办法，如浏阳甫潭社社员曹瑞前，社交四十元给他买猪，他不买猪，也不把钱交出来。
