Xinhua News Agency, Muztagh Ata, July 12th (Xinhua News Agency reporter Yang Ke Xian): Members of the Sino-Soviet Joint Mountaineering Team, after six hours of climbing on the 11th, reached an altitude of over 5,600 meters from an initial altitude of 4,500 meters (local time) around noon. By 4:00 PM (local time), they had established the first high-altitude campsite there with eight tents.

    Shi Zhanchun, the deputy leader of the mountaineering team, told the reporter via walkie-talkie from the mountain at 4:00 PM on the 11th that they had now climbed above the snow line, but the temperature on the mountain was still at 24.5 degrees Celsius. Many mountaineers were wearing long-sleeved shirts and sunglasses. Everyone's morale was high.

    The temperature on the mountain fluctuates greatly. On the 11th, it reached around 30 degrees Celsius at noon, but on the night of the 10th and the morning of the 11th, the athletes had to wear down jackets to keep warm.

    Shi Zhanchun said that because the athletes had a good physical response during the first climb, the Sino-Soviet mountaineering team will continue climbing on the 12th, striving to quickly reach over 6,200 meters and establish the second and third camps.

    Nearly 1,000 kilograms of food and equipment were transported up the mountain on the morning of the 11th.

    新华社慕士塔格山12日电　新华社记者杨克现报道：中、苏混合爬山队队员十一日经过六小时登山，在中午前后（当地时间），已经从拔海四千五百公尺处到达拔海五千六百多公尺的高度，到了下午四时（当地时间）他们在那里建立了第一号高山宿营地的八个帐篷。
    爬山队副队长史占春十一日下午四时在山上用报话机向记者说，现在他们已经攀登到雪线以上，但是山上的气温仍在摄氏二十四度半，许多爬山运动员穿着长袖衬衣，戴着遮光眼镜活动，大家情绪高涨。
    山上气温变化很大，十一日中午曾达摄氏三十度左右，但是，十日夜间和十一日早晨，运动员们不得不穿着鸭绒衣御寒。
    史占春说，由于运动员在第一次登山中，身体反应良好，中、苏爬山队十二日将继续登山，争取迅速到达六千二百多公尺以上，建立第二和第三号营地。
    全部近千斤食品和用具十一日早晨已经运上山去。
