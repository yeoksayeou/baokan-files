    Feeding Pigs with Fermented Feed
    Yan Zhao
    The Fuzhou branch of the Jiangxi Provincial Food Company used over sixty kinds of wild vegetables, wild grasses, tree leaves, and other ingredients to make fermented feed for pigs, saving feed costs and solving the difficulty of insufficient refined feed. The company initially conducted a typical experiment: ten pigs were fed ordinary feed, and ten pigs were fed fermented feed. The results of the twenty-eight-day experiment showed that the pigs fed ordinary feed gained a total of 157.5 jin, an average of nine liang per pig per day, and the feed cost for the ten pigs was 31.27 yuan; the pigs fed fermented feed gained an average of ten liang three qian per pig per day, and the feed cost for the ten pigs was 25.38 yuan. The Jiangxi Provincial Food Company summarized the experience of the Fuzhou branch and introduced and promoted it to the entire provincial food company system. According to statistics from fourteen county food companies, in the second half of last year, the use of fermented feed saved a total of 310,000 jin of broken rice and more than 709,000 jin of fine and coarse bran, saving feed costs of more than 49,900 yuan. The Jiangxi Provincial Food Company system has fully implemented the use of fermented feed this year, and fermented feed will account for 30% of all feed. According to the specific conditions of each county, fermented feed can account for a quarter of all feed in the first and fourth quarters, and one-third in the second and third quarters.
    The collection of wild plants is very easy, which can reduce the manpower and time spent on cooking, save fuel, and because the fermented feed has a fragrant and sour taste, it can enhance the pig's appetite, and it is easy to digest, which can make the pig gain weight faster.
    When carrying out the work of assigning and purchasing live pigs, the Fuzhou Food Company also introduced the method of raising pigs with fermented feed to agricultural producers' cooperatives, dispelling farmers' concerns about raising pigs due to fear of insufficient feed, and playing a great role in promoting the work of assigning and purchasing live pigs. Now many agricultural producers' cooperatives and farmers have adopted the method of raising pigs with fermented feed. Ge Tangpo, the vice-chairman of the Lianxi Agricultural Cooperative in Nanchang, accepted the experience of feeding pigs with fermented feed, and the daily feeding cost per pig was reduced by 2.7 fen, saving 10 yuan in cost for raising a pig for one year.

    用发酵饲料喂猪
    严钊
    江西省食品公司抚州分公司采用六十多种野菜、野草、树叶等制成发酵饲料喂养猪，节省了饲料费用，解决了精饲料不足的困难。这个公司在最初是这样进行典型试验的：用十头猪喂普通饲料，用十头猪喂发酵饲料。试验二十八天的结果，喂普通饲料的猪共增膘157.5斤，平均每头每天长膘九两，十头猪饲料费用共31.27元；喂发酵饲料的猪平均每头每天长膘十两三钱，十头猪饲料费用共25.38元。江西省食品公司总结了抚州分公司这一经验，就向全省食品公司系统介绍推广。据十四个县食品公司的统计，去年下半年由于采用发酵饲料，共节约了碎米三十一万斤、细糠和粗糠七十万九千多斤，节省了饲料费用四万九千九百多元。江西省食品公司系统今年已经全面推行采用发酵饲料的办法，采用发酵饲料将占全部饲料的30％。根据各县的具体情况，发酵饲料在一、四季度可占全部饲料的四分之一，二、三季度可占三分之一。
    野生植物的采集很容易，可以减少煮馊的人力和时间，节约燃料，并且因为发酵饲料带有香气和酸味，可以增强猪的食欲，吃了也容易消化，可以使猪长膘更快。
    抚州食品公司在进行生猪派养派购工作的时候，也向农业生产合作社介绍了用发酵饲料养猪的办法，解除了农民因为怕饲料不足而不愿养猪的顾虑，对推动生猪派养派购工作起了很大的作用。现在已经有很多农业生产合作社和农民都采用了发酵饲料养猪的办法。南昌莲溪农业合作社副社长葛堂婆接受了发酵饲料喂猪的经验，每头猪每日饲养费比原先减少二分七厘，一头猪养一年能节省成本十元。（附图片）
