Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: This year, various irrigation areas across the country have promoted many advanced irrigation experiences in spring and summer irrigation work, with good results.

Planned water use has been implemented on more than ten million mu of land in twenty-four provinces and regions across the country, an increase of nearly fifty times compared to the area promoted last year. The characteristic of planned water use is to conduct irrigation in a planned way according to the water requirements of crops in various development stages and local climate, soil, water source and other conditions. It can ensure the continuous increase of soil fertility and enable crops to obtain higher yields. Last year, the experience of new methods of paddy field soaking, frequent watering and shallow irrigation, which was effectively tested on large areas of rice fields in Sichuan, has also been promoted in many parts of the country this year. In some rice fields in southern Shaanxi, due to the implementation of new methods of paddy field soaking, 15% of water was saved compared to the old irrigation methods.

This year, various localities have also vigorously promoted experiences such as dryland ditch irrigation, ridge irrigation, and shallow rice irrigation. In some areas of Shaanxi, Sichuan, and Hubei, dryland crops such as wheat and oil tea were generally not irrigated in the past. This year, irrigation has been carried out on larger areas of dryland, and it is estimated that production can be increased by more than 30%.

    许多新的灌溉法在推广
    新华社讯　今年全国各个灌溉区在春灌和夏灌工作中推行了许多先进的灌溉经验，收效很好。
    计划用水已在全国二十四个省区的一千多万亩土地上推行，比去年推行的面积增加将近五十倍。计划用水的特点，是根据农作物各个发育阶段的需水情况以及当地气候、土壤、水源等条件来有计划地进行灌溉，它能保证土壤肥力不断增加，使农作物获得较高的产量。去年在四川大面积稻田上试行有效的新法泡田、勤浇浅灌的经验，今年也在全国很多地区推广。陕西南部一部分稻田由于推行新法泡田，较过去老法灌溉省水15％。
    今年各地还大力推广了旱作沟灌、畦灌和水稻浅灌等经验。陕西、四川、湖北的一些地区，过去小麦、油茶等旱作物一般不进行灌溉，今年都在较大旱作面积上进行了灌溉，估计可增产30％以上。
