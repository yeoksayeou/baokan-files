Xinhua News Agency, 2nd dispatch from New York: The 650,000 American steelworkers, who began a nationwide strike on the 1st, are prepared to "fight to the end" until they obtain an "honest and fair settlement."

The United Steelworkers of America wage policy committee expressed this attitude in a statement issued on the 1st. The policy committee condemned the steel companies' "arrogant attempt to force the union to accept an inadequate" solution, and stated that the workers would not go to work without a wage contract. The policy committee said that the union was better prepared and had considerable funds to support a strike longer than the one in 1952, which lasted 56 days and was the largest steel strike in the United States after the war.

Steelworkers in Pittsburgh, Gary, and other American steel cities have left the closed factories and set up picket lines around the factories.

On the day the strike began, Joseph F. Finnegan, Director of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service, stated in Washington that he would hold meetings with representatives of both labor and management separately to study the situation regarding contract negotiations. It is disclosed that this action by the government is considered to be preparing for further direct intervention in the strike.

    美国钢铁工人决心斗争到底
    匹兹堡等城市钢铁工人都已离厂并设置纠察线
    新华社2日讯　纽约消息：一日开始举行全国大罢工的美国六十五万钢铁工人准备“战斗到底”，直到获得一个“正直和公平的解决”为止。
    美国联合钢铁工人工会工资政策委员会在一日发表的一项声明中表示了这样的态度。政策委员会谴责钢铁公司“狂妄地企图强迫工会去接受一个不适当的”解决办法，并且表示，没有工资合同，工人决不去上工。政策委员会说，工会已经有了较好的准备和相当的资金来支持一次比1952年更长时间的罢工，那一次罢工继续了五十六天，是美国战后最大的一次钢铁大罢工。
    在匹兹堡、格利以及其他美国的钢铁城市的钢铁工人都已离开了关闭了的工厂，并且在工厂周围设置了纠察线。
    在罢工开始后的当天，美国联邦劳工调解局局长芬纳根在华盛顿表示他要就合同谈判问题分别和劳资双方代表举行研究情况的会议。据透露，政府的这种行动，被认为是要为下一步直接干涉罢工作好准备。
