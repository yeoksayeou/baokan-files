    Seventy-Two Cadres, More Than Ten Organizational Forms
    The People's Bank of Wuxing County, Zhejiang Province, has a staff of thirty-five cadres according to its establishment. If those who frequently go to the countryside and on business trips are excluded, there are actually only twenty-seven people at home. However, there are as many as sixteen organizations across the bank. Now, let's write them down below: Party branch, Communist Youth League branch, trade union, study committee, welfare committee, sports association, competition committee, selection committee, catering committee, savings association, greening committee, "eliminate the four pests" headquarters, "promote Putonghua" group, women's group, supervision group, security and confidentiality group, etc. With these organizations in place, there will inevitably be a series of meetings, both large and small: Party branch committee meeting, Party branch general meeting, Party group meeting, Communist Youth League branch committee meeting, Communist Youth League branch general meeting, Communist Youth League group meeting, trade union committee, trade union member congress, trade union group meeting…; In addition, there are various administrative meetings: bank affairs meetings, section affairs meetings, life review meetings…. Without further elaboration, one can imagine that these complicated meetings consume the time and energy of the staff. Some people are simply buried in the sea of meetings day and night, never able to get ashore. Of course, some organizations and some meetings are necessary, but the complicated organizations and repetitive meetings can be greatly reduced.
    Comrades have made suggestions for improvement to the leading comrades more than once, but the leading comrades insist that this is "sound organization," "complete meetings," and "looks like something." This is really incomprehensible. What role will these overlapping organizations play? What effect will these repeated meetings have?

    七十二个干部，十多个组织形式
    浙江省吴兴县人民银行按照编制人数是三十五个干部，如果除掉经常下乡和出差的，在家的实际上只有二十七人，可是全行性的组织竟有十六个之多。现在不妨把它写在下面：党支部，团支部，工会，学委会，福利委员会，体育协会，竞赛委员会，评选委员会，膳食委员会，储金协会，绿化委员会，除四害指挥部，推广普通话小组，妇女小组，监察小组，保卫保密小组等。既然有了这些组织，必然就有一连串大小会议：党支委会、党支部大会、党小组会、团支委会、团支部大会、团小组会、工会委员会、工会会员大会、工会小组会……；另外还有各种行政会议：行务会议、股务会议、生活检讨会……。不必更多的叙述，就可想而知，这些繁杂的会议，把职工的时间和精力都消磨掉了。有些人简直就昼夜埋在会议的大海中，永远不得上岸。当然，有些组织有些会议都是必要的，但是，繁杂的组织，重复的会议都是可以大大减少的。
    同志们不止一次的向领导同志提出改进的意见，可是领导同志却坚持说这样才算是“组织健全”，“会议完整”，“像个样子”。这真令人难以理解。这些重重叠叠的组织倒底会起什么作用呢？这些翻来复去的会议倒底会发生什么效果呢？
