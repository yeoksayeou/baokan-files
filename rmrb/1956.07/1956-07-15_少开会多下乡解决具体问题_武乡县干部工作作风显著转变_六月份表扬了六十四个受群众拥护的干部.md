Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, July 13th. After criticizing commandism and a floating work style in rural work, Wuxiang County has seen a significant change in the work style of county and district cadres.

With the transformation of work style, the activities of county and district cadres show a new trend: fewer meetings, fewer reports, more in-depth investigation, more solutions to specific problems, and more creativity. At the same time, the county leadership has received many suggestions from the masses praising cadres.

After the realization of advanced agricultural producers' cooperatives in the county, blind optimism and a simplistic commandist work style grew among the leading cadres of the county and districts. The Wuxiang County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party launched a top-down criticism of this harmful sentiment and work style. In the past two months, members of the Wuxiang County Committee of the CPC, after going deep into the townships and cooperatives, successively summarized and promoted eleven experiences, such as the field management responsibility system and resolving the contradiction between individual and collective labor of cooperative members. They also organized on-site observation and discussions among cadres in the townships and cooperatives to promote the experience of working in depth with the masses, and patiently educated and effectively helped them solve difficulties in their work.

The county conducted two evaluations, and in the June evaluation, sixty-four cadres with an in-depth work style and supported by the masses, such as Ma Fushou, were commended. Eight cadres with a floating work style and commandist shortcomings, such as Wang Baochang, were criticized. This stimulated the cadres' enthusiasm for improving their work style. In addition, cadres going to the countryside carry a work card. When they leave an area, the township and cooperative fill in their work style, task completion, and mass opinions. This is beneficial for urging cadres going to the countryside to work in depth, for the leading organs to understand the work of the cadres going to the countryside, and for improving the leadership's work style.

After this systematic improvement of the leadership's work style, there are now more and more county and district cadres throughout the county who are supported by the masses because of their in-depth work. According to statistics, the number of such cadres has increased from 24% to 58% of the total number of county and district cadres, while the number of cadres with shortcomings in their work style, which originally accounted for 9% of the total number of county and district cadres, has decreased to 2%.

    少开会多下乡解决具体问题
    武乡县干部工作作风显著转变
    六月份表扬了六十四个受群众拥护的干部
    新华社太原13日电　武乡县在批判了农村工作中的命令主义和飘浮作风以后，现在县区干部的工作作风有了显著的改变。
    随着作风的转变，在县区干部活动中，出现了开会少，汇报少，深入多，解决具体问题多和创造多的新气象。同时，县的领导机关接到很多表扬干部的群众建议。
    这个县在农村实现高级合作化以后，在县区领导干部中滋长着盲目乐观情绪和简单命令作风。这个县的中共县委对这种有害情绪和作风，发动了自上而下的批判。最近两个月，中共武乡县委会的委员深入乡和社以后，接连总结和推广了田间管理责任地和解决社员个人与集体劳动矛盾等十一项经验。他们在乡、社间还组织在乡干部现场观察和座谈，以推广深入群众工作的经验，并且耐心教育和切实帮助，解决他们工作上的困难。
    全县进行了两次评比鉴定，在六月份评比中表扬了马福寿等六十四个作风深入、群众拥护的干部，批判了王保昌等作风飘浮和有命令主义缺点的八个干部，这样作就启发了干部改进作风的积极性。此外，下乡干部携带一种工作卡片，当离开一个地区时，就由所在乡、社填写对他的工作作风、任务完成情况和群众意见。这对督促下乡干部深入工作，领导机关了解下乡干部工作情况，和改进领导作风都有好处。
    经过这次系统改进领导作风以后，现在全县因工作深入得到群众拥护的县、区干部愈来愈多，据统计，这样的干部已由全体县、区干部人数的24％增加到58％，原占全体县、区干部人数9％的作风上有缺点的干部已减少到2％。
