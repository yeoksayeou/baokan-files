Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi, July 6th. Bricklayers Wang Fengqi, Li Wen, and Liu Fugui from the First Engineering Company of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region all broke the national bricklaying record on July 4th. Wang Fengqi laid 10,166 bricks in nine hours, Liu Fugui laid 9,524 bricks, and Li Wen laid 9,260 bricks.

    After studying Yang Changshi's bricklaying method in Chongqing, the bricklayers of the Third Construction Team improved upon it. They expanded the work surface from twelve meters to fifteen meters, reducing non-productive time. When laying bricks in areas with doors and windows, they adopted a mortar scoop that was more convenient than the mortar spreader and improved the coordination of collaborative work. This has continuously improved bricklaying efficiency.

    新疆三个工人突破全国砌砖纪录
    新华社乌鲁木齐6日电　新疆维吾尔自治区第一工程公司瓦工王凤歧、李文和刘福贵，七月四日都突破了全国砌砖的最高纪录。王凤歧用九小时砌砖一万零一百六十六块，刘福贵砌了九千五百二十四块，李文砌了九千二百六十块。
    第三施工队的砌砖工人学习了重庆杨长诗的砌砖法以后，又改进了这个方法。他们把工作面从十二公尺扩大到十五公尺，减少了非生产时间。在有门窗的地方砌砖的时候，采用了比铺灰器更便利的铺灰撮，并且改进了协作配合工作。这样，使得砌砖效率不断提高。
