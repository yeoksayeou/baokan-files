Xinhua News Agency, Luobei, 10th -- On the desolate Luobei Grassland in Heilongjiang Province, six houses have already been built. These are some of the first houses completed of the seven new villages that the seven youth collective farms in the Luobei Youth Reclamation Area plan to build this year. All the villagers will move into their new homes successively from the end of July to the latter half of October.

　　This year, these seven new villages will build approximately one hundred and twenty-six houses, covering an area of over fifty hectares. The capital construction department of the Youth Reclamation Area Committee has already designed planning maps for these new villages. The village sites were chosen by the villagers themselves, all in scenic locations near mountains and water.

　　These new villages will build collective dormitories, family dormitories, and canteens this year, and nurseries, primary schools, shops, and clinics, etc., within three to five years. These houses are built to adapt to local climatic conditions, with fire walls, heated brick beds, and other cold-proof equipment inside, and thick thatched roofs. According to the experience of local farmers over the decades, these houses can defend against the Siberian cold winds even in the coldest winter days. Family residences all have side gardens and places to raise poultry.

　　The villagers have put in arduous labor in building the new villages. From making adobe bricks, making house frames, and building walls, the villagers have done it all themselves. In the Beijing Youth Collective Farm, only villagers Wang Wensheng and Zhu Xueli had worked as bricklayers at home. They became the villagers' "masters" and formed a bricklaying team to undertake the construction task. The villagers of the "May Fourth" Youth Collective Farm discovered that the soil there could be used to fire bricks and tiles, so they built a brick kiln and invited several technicians to teach them the technique of firing bricks, preparing to build some brick-and-wood structures this year.

### 萝北草原上建设新村

    萝北草原上建设新村
    在荒无人烟的黑龙江省萝北草原上已经兴建了六栋房屋。这是萝北青年垦区的七个青年集体农庄今年计划建设的七座新村中最先竣工的几栋房屋。在七月底到十月下旬全部庄员将陆续搬进新居。
    这七座新村今年修建的房屋大约有一百二十六栋，占地约五十多公顷。青年垦区委员会的基本建设部门已经为这些新村设计了规划图。村址是由庄员们自己选择的，都是依山傍水，风景秀丽的地方。
    这些新村将要在今年内建筑集体宿舍、家属宿舍和食堂，三、五年内修建托儿所、小学校、商店和医务所等。这些房屋都是按着适应当地气候条件修建的，室内有火墙、火炕等防寒设备，屋顶铺着厚厚的茅草。根据当地农民数十年的经验，这些房屋在数九寒天也能防御西伯利亚的寒风。家属住宅都有宅旁园地和饲养家禽的地方。
    庄员们在修建新村时付出了艰巨的劳动。从造土坯、制房架和砌墙都是庄员们自己动手做的。北京青年集体农庄只有庄员王文生和朱学礼在家里作过瓦工，他俩便成了庄员们的“师傅”，成立了瓦工队，承担修建任务。“五四”青年集体农庄的庄员发现那里的土壤可以烧砖瓦，就修了一座砖窑，并且请几名技工教给他们烧砖的技术，准备今年修建一些砖木结构的房屋。
