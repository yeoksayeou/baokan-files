    The Militiamen of the Coastal Defense Outpost
    Chen Zhaoming
    The broad masses of militiamen in the Minhou area, situated at the forefront of coastal defense, have played a significant role in cooperating with the Chinese People's Liberation Army in carrying out the struggle against the enemy and maintaining public order.
    The militiamen put forward the slogan "Discover the enemy on the sea and eliminate the enemy at sea," and persisted in patrolling and guarding the coastline regardless of weather, ensuring the consolidation of coastal defense. Once, the U.S.-Chiang Kai-shek special agent organization dispatched four special agents with radios, short guns, etc. to land in Zhongma Township, Lianjiang County, but before they could gain a foothold, they were all captured by our militiamen. Another time, a group of bandits and special agents landed from Changle, but they were all wiped out by the militiamen of Fuqing and Changle counties the next day. The militiamen who participated in these two battles were rewarded by the leading organs of the Fujian Military Region.
    The militiamen also actively launched a political offensive against the Chiang Kai-shek army, sending hundreds of thousands of propaganda materials to enemy-occupied islands in nearly four months.
    In maintaining public order work such as protecting bridges and warehouses, the militiamen implemented a "zoning and section responsibility system," which ensured the reliable protection of hundreds of bridges and warehouses in the entire region. Once, counter-revolutionaries lurking in Daan Township, Minqing County, took advantage of the absence of township cadres attending meetings in the district and most of the militiamen engaged in sideline production, attempting to burn down a warehouse. However, they were exposed by Li Wenjun, the militiaman on duty, and hundreds of thousands of kilograms of grain were saved from loss.

    海防前哨的民兵们
    陈兆铭
    处在海防前线闽侯地区的广大民兵，在配合中国人民解放军执行对敌斗争和维护治安工作中发挥了巨大的作用。
    民兵们提出了“发现敌人于海面，消灭敌人在海上”的口号，不分晴雨，坚持在海岸线上巡逻和警戒，保证了海防的巩固。一次，美蒋特务机关派遣四名特务随带电台、短枪等在连江县中麻乡登陆，但立脚未稳，就全部被我民兵捕获，又有一次一股匪特从长乐登陆，但在第二天就被福清、长乐两县民兵全部消灭。参加这两次战斗的民兵都受到福建军区领导机关的奖励。
    民兵们还积极开展了对蒋军的政治攻势，近四个月中，他们向敌占岛屿送去的宣传品有几十万份。
    民兵们在护桥、护仓等维护治安的工作中，实行“划区分段负责制”使全区数百座桥梁和仓库得到了可靠的保障。有一次，潜藏在闽清县大安乡的反革命分子乘乡干部到区开会，民兵大部分外出进行副业生产的空隙，企图烧毁某仓库。但是被值勤的民兵李文俊破获了，几十万斤粮食免受损失。
