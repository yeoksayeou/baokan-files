Xinhua News Agency, July 24th. The twenty-eight Japanese war criminals on trial in Shenyang unanimously expressed their gratitude for the lenient treatment by the Chinese government, and firmly supported peace, forever opposing wars of aggression. This was stated in recorded talks with reporters from the Central People's Broadcasting Station after the court's verdict.

　　Takebe Rokuzo, the former Chief of General Affairs of the puppet Manchukuo, who was sentenced to twenty years imprisonment and has now been paroled, confessed after the sentencing: "I once served as the Chief of General Affairs of the puppet Manchukuo. During this period, I committed many crimes violating international law and humanitarianism. Japan and China are neighboring countries with kinship. However, Japan's invasion of China's sacred territory was a great mistake. I was sentenced to twenty years in prison. I believe that China's judgment is a correct judgment truly based on justice." Takebe Rokuzo also said: Japan and China should restore diplomatic relations as soon as possible, normalize relations, and re-establish a truly brotherly friendship. He said, "I express my deep gratitude for this judgment, and at the same time guarantee that I will never again play the role of imperialism in carrying out aggression. I will dedicate the rest of my life to the peace of Asia and the peace of the world."

　　Furuhata Tadayuki, the former Vice-Minister of the General Affairs Agency of the puppet Manchukuo, who was sentenced to eighteen years imprisonment, said: "It was through studying in China that I realized the serious crimes I committed against the Chinese people. Moreover, I realized that I should naturally bear this responsibility." He also said: "During this trial, although I should have been sentenced to death, the Chinese government still made a very lenient judgment. I was only sentenced to eighteen years in prison, and the number of days after being arrested can be deducted from the sentence, which is a lenient policy that I never even imagined. I hope that the Japanese people will think about the filthy and sinful acts of the mistakes I have committed in the past. I have now realized the causes of aggressive wars, and what their consequences are. I want to state my determination: No matter what situation I am in, I will contribute everything to oppose aggressive wars and defend peace."

　　Sugihara Kazusaku, who was sentenced to eighteen years imprisonment, first spoke about his crimes of imprisoning and massacring our country's anti-Japanese national salvation personnel and peaceful residents. Then he said, "The crimes I have committed against the Chinese people are major crimes that violate international law and undermine the principles of humanitarianism, and of course, I should be sentenced to death immediately." He also said: Now that I have received this kind of judgment, I express my heartfelt gratitude. From this judgment, I feel how much the Chinese people love peace." Sugihara Kazusaku finally said: "Japanese people, I do not want you to take the path I have taken again. I truly understand that this is a path that disrupts world peace and, in reality, destroys the Japanese nation. I am determined to fight for the eternal friendship between the Chinese and Japanese people and for world peace."

　　Shimura Yukio, who was sentenced to twelve years imprisonment, said: "The aggressive war waged by Japanese imperialism brought profound disasters and losses to the Chinese people, the Asian people, and the Japanese people. I oppose aggressive wars and will never repeat the mistakes of the past. I must become a true human being. I must move forward along the path of light and hope pointed out by the Chinese people, the benefactors who have preserved my life and allowed me to recognize the truth. I firmly oppose the revival of Japanese militarism and rearmament."

　　Horiguchi Masao, the former Lieutenant Colonel Captain of the Jinzhou Japanese Gendarmerie, spoke about the humane treatment he received from the Chinese people. He said, "The humanity of the Chinese people is truly indescribable. They are all people with beautiful souls and a sense of justice." He said, "I want to dedicate the only life that the Chinese people have preserved for me to work for peace. I want to fight against the imperialists who attempt to launch aggressive wars."

　　Kobayashi Kiichi, the former Major Captain of the Xing'an Japanese Gendarmerie, who was sentenced to twelve years imprisonment, hoped to say a few words to his wife Kobayashi Sonoko in Japan through radio broadcasting. He said, "The Chinese people have preserved my life and taught me the path that I should follow as an upright person. I have firm hope and confidence in the future. I must actively work hard, resolutely oppose war, and fight for peace and for the friendship between the Chinese and Japanese people."

    受审的日本战争犯罪分子忏悔过去的罪行  
    决心拥护和平反对侵略战争
    据新华社24日讯　在沈阳受审判的二十八名日本战争犯罪分子一致表示感谢中国政府的宽大处理，并坚决拥护和平，永远反对侵略战争。这是他们在法庭判决后，向中央人民广播电台记者作录音谈话时表示的。
    被判处二十年徒刑而现已被假释的前伪满洲国总务长官武部六藏在宣判后忏悔说：“我曾经担任伪满洲国的总务长官。在这期间，我犯了违反国际法和人道主义的许多罪行。“日本和中国是近邻国家，有着亲戚关系。然而，日本侵略了中国神圣的领土，这是一个很大的错误。我被判处徒刑二十年。我相信中国的判决是真正基于正义的正确的判决。”武部六藏还说：日本和中国应该早日恢复邦交，使邦交正常化，重新建立真正像兄弟一般的友谊。他说：“我对这次判决表示非常感谢，同时保证今后决不充当帝国主义实行侵略的角色。我要以我的余生来为亚洲的和平、为世界的和平而努力。”
    被判处十八年徒刑的伪满洲国总务厅次长古海忠之说：“我在中国经过学习，才认识到自己对中国人民所犯的严重罪行。并且，我认识到自己当然应该承担起这个责任。”他又说：“在这次审判时，尽管我是应该被处以极刑，中国政府仍然作了非常宽大的判决。对我只判处徒刑十八年，而且可以把被逮捕以后的日数抵算刑期，这实在是想都想不到的宽大政策。我希望日本的人士想一想我过去所犯的错误的污秽的罪恶行为。我现在已经认识到发生侵略战争的原因，而它的结果又是什么。我要说明我的决心：我不论处在什么情况下面都要贡献出一切，为反对侵略战争、保卫和平而斗争。”
    被判处十八年徒刑的杉原一策首先谈了他监禁和屠杀我国抗日救国人员和和平居民的罪行。然后他说：“我对中国人民所犯的罪行，是违反国际法、破坏人道主义原则的大罪，当然应该立刻被判处死刑。他又说：现在我受到这种判决，由衷地表示感谢。我从这个判决中感觉到，中国人民是怎样热爱着和平。”杉原一策最后说：“日本的人士们，我不希望您们再走我所走过的道路。我真正了解到，这是扰乱世界和平，而且在实际上是使日本民族毁灭的道路。我决心为中日两国人民的永远的友好，为世界和平而斗争。”
    被判处十二年徒刑的志村行雄说：“日本帝国主义进行的侵略战争中给中国人民、亚洲人民、日本人民带来了深重的灾难和损失。我反对侵略战争，决不再犯过去的错误。我一定要成为一个真正的人。我要按照保全了我的性命、让我认识到真理的再造恩人——中国人民所指出的光明和希望的道路向前迈进。我坚决反对复活日本军国主义和重整军备。”
    前锦州日本宪兵队中佐队长堀口正雄谈了中国人民对他的人道待遇的情况。他说：“中国人民的人类爱，实在是不能用言语来形容的。他们都是有着美丽的灵魂和正义感的人们。”他说：“我要把中国人民保全了我的唯一的生命贡献出来，为和平而努力。我要向企图发动侵略战争的帝国主义者进行斗争。”
    被判处十二年徒刑的前兴安日本宪兵队少佐队长小林喜一希望通过电台广播向他在日本的妻子小林园子说几句话。他说：“中国人民保全了我的性命，并且教导我作为一个正直的人所应遵循的道路。我对前途抱有坚定的希望和信心。我一定要积极努力，坚决反对战争，为了和平，为了中日两国人民的友谊而进行斗争。”
