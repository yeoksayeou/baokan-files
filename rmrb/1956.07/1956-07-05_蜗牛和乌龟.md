    A snail was preparing to travel the world.
    It thought: Wait a minute! I need to learn a set of rules for traveling from someone, otherwise, I will be unable to move an inch.
    The snail went to consult the turtle. The turtle told him:
    "It's very simple. According to the patterns on the turtle shell, good and bad luck can be indicated. When I was young, I traveled to various countries. I simply carried my turtle shell on my back and went everywhere!"
    The snail heard this and quickly climbed back to the sea, found a white conch shell with patterns, and carried it on its body. Then it embarked on its long journey.
    From then on, it seemed to be carrying a house on its back, crawling slowly.
    Later people ridiculed the snail, saying: "You are obsessed with an old set of rules, carrying it heavily on your body, how can you run fast?"

    蜗牛和乌龟
    余毅忠
    一只蜗牛准备去遨游全世界。
    它想：且慢！我要向谁领教一套游历的规矩，不然，就会寸步难行的。
    蜗牛去请教乌龟。乌龟告诉他说：
    “事情很简单。根据龟甲的花纹，可以指示吉凶。当我还年青的时候，曾经周游列国。我索性把龟甲背起来，就到处走了！”
    蜗牛听说，连忙爬回海里，找到一个有花纹的白螺壳，背在身上。然后踏上他漫长的征途。
    从此，它仿佛背着一座屋子，慢吞吞地爬行。
    后来的人讥笑蜗牛说：“你执迷于一套老规矩，把它沉重地背上身，怎能跑得快呢？”
