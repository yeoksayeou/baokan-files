Xinhua News Agency, Luobei, 14th – The first group of Beijing youth volunteer reclamation team members who came to the Luobei Grassland have become the backbone of the Beijing Youth Collective Farm in the Luobei Youth Reclamation Area after ten months of training.

This collective farm, named after Beijing, is composed of the Beijing Youth Volunteer Reclamation Team, which served as the vanguard of the reclamation effort, and the second group of team members. Yang Hua, one of the initiators of the reclamation team, serves as the chairman of this farm, while the other two initiators, Li Bingheng and Pang Shuying, serve as vice chairmen.

Yang Hua told Xinhua News Agency reporters that thirty of the sixty members of the Beijing Youth Volunteer Reclamation Team have already taken on positions such as farm chairman, production team leader, and Party and Youth League branch secretary. So far, eighteen members of the reclamation team have requested to join the Chinese Communist Party. On the "May Fourth" Youth Day, two young people were approved to join the Communist Youth League.

During the ten months of labor in the Great Northern Wilderness, the team members have learned the techniques of land reclamation, house building, and new methods of sowing. Han Shuqin, who had just taken off her red scarf around this time last year, is now the secretary of the farm's Communist Youth League branch, and he has learned to make adobe bricks. Song Dianyou, the current leader of the carpentry team, is only twenty years old, and can now manufacture everything from house frames to doors and windows, and has become recognized as a good carpenter by the entire village. Deng Guiying, who attended the Heilongjiang Province Youth Reclamation Activists Conference for his achievements as a cook and administrator during land reclamation and winter production last year, has now learned sewing skills. He and his companions also sewed summer clothes for the village's girls and young men to wear during breaks.

    北京青年垦荒队在萝北草原
    新华社萝北14日电　首批来到萝北草原上的北京市青年志愿垦荒队员们，经过十个月的锻炼，已经成为萝北青年垦区的北京青年集体农庄的骨干分子。
    这个以北京命名的集体农庄是由作为垦荒事业先遣军的北京市青年志愿垦荒队和第二批队员组成的。垦荒队发起人之一的杨华担任这个农庄的主席，另两个发起人李秉衡和庞淑英担任副主席。
    杨华告诉新华社记者，北京市青年志愿垦荒队的六十名队员中已经有三十名担任农庄主席、生产队长和党团支部书记等职务。到目前为止，垦荒队员中已经有十八名队员提出加入中国共产党的要求。在“五四”青年节那天，有两名青年被批准参加了青年团。
    在北大荒十个月的劳动中，队员们已经学会了开荒、盖房和用新方法播种的技术。去年这个时候刚摘下红领巾不久的韩淑琴，现在是农庄的青年团支部书记，他学会了造土坯。现任木工队小队长的宋殿有才二十岁，现在从房架到门窗都能自己制造，已经成为全庄公认的好木工了。去年开荒和冬季生产的时候，曾因作炊事员和管理员有成绩而出席黑龙江省青年垦荒积极分子大会的邓桂英，现在又学会了缝纫手艺。他还和他的同伴们，为全庄的姑娘和小伙子缝制休息时穿的夏装。
