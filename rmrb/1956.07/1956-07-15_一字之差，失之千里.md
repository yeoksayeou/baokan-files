    A Single Word's Difference, A Loss of a Thousand Miles
    In mid-June, Guangdong's Hainan Hardware and Machinery Company suddenly received twenty-eight boxes of hardware goods shipped from Tianjin. They had not requested goods from Tianjin, so why were so many goods delivered? It turned out that the Tianjin Hardware and Machinery Purchasing and Supplying Station mistakenly sent goods meant for the Jinan Hardware and Machinery Company of Shandong Province to them. "Jinan" and "Hainan" differ by only one word, but this batch of goods traveled thousands of miles for no reason.

    一字之差，失之千里
    六月中旬，广东省海南五金机械公司突然收到由天津运来的二十八箱五金商品。他们并没有向天津要货，为甚么会运来这么多商品呢？原来是天津五金机械采购供应站把要发给山东省济南市五金机械公司的货，误发给他们了。“济南”和“海南”，仅是一字之差，可是这批货就无原无故旅行了几千里。
