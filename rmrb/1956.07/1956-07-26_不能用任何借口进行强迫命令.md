    Compulsory Orders Must Not Be Carried Out Under Any Pretext
    The Southern Daily reported on July 17th on incidents of compulsory orders in Nadan Township, Yangchun County, and Fengcun Township, Hua County, Guangdong Province, and published an editorial entitled "Compulsory Orders Must Not Be Imposed on the Masses Under Any Pretext." Due to the subjective and one-sided production tasks proposed by the leading organs, the district and township cadres adopted compulsory methods to complete the tasks, which seriously damaged the interests of the local farmers and harmed the close relationship between the Party and the masses.

    The editorial pointed out: After the realization of cooperation, some cadres mistakenly believed that the peasants' production labor was all under the command of the cooperative, and there was no need to do arduous and meticulous ideological and political work anymore. As a result, compulsory orders reappeared. In addition to using names such as "spontaneous forces," "right-leaning conservatism," and "ideological backwardness" to "criticize" the masses, and even putting hats like "reactionary" and "walking the Taiwan route" to scare the masses, withholding food stamps and deducting work points became the most "convenient" and most commonly used methods to force the masses to act.

    After severely criticizing some excuses for defending compulsory orders, the editorial pointed out that the subjective and bureaucratic leadership style of the leading organs is a major reason for the occurrence of compulsory orders in rural areas. Some Party leading organs do not have a concrete understanding of actual life, and the ideas and tasks they put forward are subjective and one-sided. At the same time, they cannot humbly listen to and earnestly consider the different opinions raised by the lower levels, but indiscriminately use the shield of "ideological problems" to block them back. When repeated orders are not effective, they adopt methods such as public criticism, suspension for reflection, and disciplinary actions to force the lower levels to act blindly. In this way, lower-level cadres are naturally prone to adopting a compulsory attitude towards the masses.

    Therefore, it is absolutely necessary for the leading organs to the grassroots organizations to promote the spirit of democracy, overcome bureaucracy, strengthen the connection between higher and lower levels, care about the sufferings of the people, consult with the masses in everything, and insist on using the method of persuasion and education to carry out work.

### 不能用任何借口进行强迫命令

专栏：地方报纸评论摘要

    不能用任何借口进行强迫命令
    七月十七日南方日报报道了广东省阳春县那旦乡和花县冯村乡发生的强迫命令的事件，并发表了题为“不能以任何借口对群众强迫命令”的社论。由于领导机关主观片面地提出生产任务，区乡干部又采取了强迫命令的方法去完成任务，以致严重地损害了当地农民的利益，损害了党同群众的亲密关系。
    社论指出：在实现合作化以后，某些干部错误地以为，农民的生产劳动都受合作社指挥，不再需要做艰苦细致的思想政治工作了。于是，强迫命令又出现了。除了用“自发势力”、“右倾保守”、“思想落后”之类名义来“批判”群众，甚至给扣上“反动”、“走台湾路线”之类的帽子来吓唬群众之外，扣留粮票、扣工分，就变成最“便利”最常用的强迫群众行动的办法。
    社论在严厉地批驳了一些为强迫命令行为辩护的借口之后指出，领导机关的主观主义和官僚主义的领导作风，是农村中发生强迫命令的一个主要原因。有些党的领导机关对实际生活的了解不具体，出的主意和提的任务带有主观片面性，同时对下面提出的不同意见又不能虚心倾听，切实考虑，而是不问情由地一律用“思想有问题”的盾牌挡了回去，当到三令五申也行不通的时候，就采取了通报批评、停职反省、纪律处分等办法，强迫下面蛮干一通，这样，下面干部自然很容易对群众采取强迫命令的态度。
    因此，目前由领导机关到基层组织，有十分必要发扬民主精神，克服官僚主义，加强上下级之间的联系，关心人民群众的痛痒，遇事同群众商量，坚持用说服教育的方法来进行工作。
