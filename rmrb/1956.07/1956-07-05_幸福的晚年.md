Happy Later Years
Sha Jun

On a day when the summer harvest season was approaching, I visited the Sino-Czech Friendship Agricultural Production Cooperative in Zhangguozhuang Township, a suburb of Beijing. Here, endless wheat fields, golden waves undulating in the wind, emitted a fragrance; cuckoos sang crisp songs, conveying the good news of a bountiful harvest to the cooperative members.

An old cooperative member stood beside the wheat field, muttering to himself, "What fine crops! Living today is truly a blessing!" On his wrinkled face, a layer of youthful radiance was added.

This old cooperative member is named Qin Delin, he is sixty-seven years old, and is a solitary person. In the old society, he worked for landlords his whole life, toiling away, only to end up empty-handed, with nothing but this old life without relatives or support. During the land reform, the state distributed six mu of land to him, but because his blood and sweat had long been sucked dry by the landlord, he could not do heavy work. Two mu of the six mu were left uncultivated, and the remaining four mu were also poorly cultivated. He needed to eat relief grain for half of the year.

In 1953, after the establishment of the agricultural production cooperative, Qin Delin's life began to improve. Because of his age and weak physical strength, the cooperative assigned him to raise livestock. This work was very suitable for him. In the first year of joining the cooperative, he earned 1510 work points, bought new clothes, and added a new quilt. In 1955, he earned 1955.5 work points, equivalent to three hundred and forty yuan Renminbi. In addition to food, clothing, and pocket money, he also had a sum of money deposited in the credit cooperative. This year, from spring to now, he has earned more than 1300 work points, and by the end of the year, he can increase it to 2500 work points. Life is becoming more and more interesting. Seeing that the wheat is about to be harvested and income will increase again, how can Qin Delin not be filled with emotion when he recalls the past!

Like Qin Delin, the Sino-Czech Friendship Agricultural Production Cooperative has a total of one hundred and nine households, one hundred and ninety people, of old, weak, orphaned and widowed cooperative members. In the old society, some of these people lost their parents when they were young, some lacked children in their old age, and some lost their husbands or wives in middle age. They each had their own unfortunate experiences, and in the old society, they lived through cold years. During the land reform, although they were all given a share of land and farm implements, their income was not high due to a lack of labor, and their lives still could not keep up with the average farmer. The vast majority could not do without the relief provided by the People's Government.

Among these old, weak, orphaned and widowed households, thirteen households, twenty-two people, are completely unable to work, and their food, clothing, and shelter are completely taken care of by the cooperative. The cooperative ensures that they are well-fed, warmly clothed, receive medical treatment when they are sick, and are buried when they die. The cooperative allocates money to the credit cooperative according to the actual needs of each household. Grain is allocated to the supply and marketing cooperative. The money and grain due to each household are recorded under the name of each household, and certificates are issued, which can be taken and used at any time without any restrictions. During festivals, they are also given more, and special personnel are sent to visit them. Cooperative member Jin Laojiu is an eighty-year-old solitary man. After the winter of last year, he was so weak that he could not move. The cooperative sent someone to take care of him, cook for him, wash his clothes, and start the stove for heating. When he wanted to eat something good, the cooperative sent someone to buy fresh meat and make dumplings for him. The old man was so moved that he said, "I never dreamed that I would have such a happy old age."

When I went to visit the seventy-year-old Mrs. Liang Li, she had just carried a bundle of firewood back to her home. She asked me to sit down, turned to the cooperative member Yu Zhizhong, who had led me there, and said, "Brother, there is another bundle left in the cooperative's courtyard. Please carry it back for me." Before she finished speaking, cooperative member Zhang Kaizhi had already carried the bundle of firewood into the door. A great class feeling deeply moved me, and I didn't know how to begin my visit. At this time, Mrs. Liang grabbed my hand and said, "Comrade, look, under the leadership of Chairman Mao, what good people, what a good cooperative! The cooperative gives me wheat, millet, sorghum, peanuts, sweet potatoes, coal, firewood... it really has everything I need, food, things to use..." She told me everything I wanted to know all at once.

Liang Li is still able to do some light labor. There are many people like her in the cooperative. Although most of them are nearly seventy years old, they have a long-term habit of engaging in labor, and now they still want to do some light labor. There are many things to do in the cooperative, big jobs, small jobs, heavy jobs, and light jobs. When the cooperative makes production arrangements, it always assigns small and light jobs to them. For example, during the spring plowing preparation work, they are asked to select seeds, shell peanuts, sweep street soil, and collect manure; during the summer production, they are asked to pull weeds and pick up stones in the fields; during the autumn harvest season, they are asked to pick cotton and shell corn. As for some old ladies who cannot do farm work, they are organized to go to the nurseries to help take care of the children. Before joining the cooperative, thirty-nine of these old, weak, orphaned and widowed households relied on government relief year-round; after joining the cooperative, twenty-nine of them were able to live well enough by relying only on their own light labor. According to the cooperative's statistics, the living expenses of these thirty-nine households this year will be about three thousand two hundred and ninety-two yuan. According to the remuneration calculated by the light labor arranged by the cooperative for them, they can earn four thousand six hundred and ninety-three yuan. The remuneration they deserve exceeds their actual needs.

The Sino-Czech Friendship Agricultural Production Cooperative's meticulous care for the old, weak, orphaned and widowed households makes them feel that they have a happy home, and their socialist consciousness and labor enthusiasm have been greatly improved. Many elderly people take the initiative to find work. Zhang Zhenping, a cooperative member in his seventies, often automatically goes up the mountain to carry grass to make fertilizer. Qin Delin, mentioned earlier, was also selected as a model agricultural laborer in Beijing in 1954.

    幸福的晚年
    沙军
    在夏收季节将要到来的一天，我访问了北京郊区张郭庄乡中捷友好农业生产合作社。在这里，一望无际的麦田，金黄色的波浪随风动荡，发出清香；布谷鸟唱着清脆的歌，给社员们传报丰收的喜讯。
    一个年老的社员站在麦田旁边，自言自语地说：“多好的庄稼！生活在今天，真算是有福气啊！”在他的刻满了皱纹的脸上，添上了一层青春的光彩。
    这个老社员叫秦德林，六十七岁了，是一个孤人。他在旧社会里给地主干活，劳碌了一辈子，到头来两手空空，只落得这一条无亲无靠的老命。土地改革的时候，国家分给他六亩土地，因为他的血汗早已叫地主吸干了，干不了重活，六亩地荒了二亩，其余四亩也种得不好。一年当中需要吃半年的救济粮。
    1953年农业生产合作社成立，秦德林入社以后，生活才算有了好转。社里因为他年岁大，体力弱，分配他饲养牲口。这个活对他很合适。入社第一年，他就挣了1510个工分，买了新衣，添了新被。1955年，他挣了1955.5个工分，折合三百四十元人民币，除吃穿零用以外，还有一笔余款存入信用合作社。今年从春季到现在他已挣到1300多个工分，到年底可增加2500个工分。日子越过越有意思了，眼看着麦子就要丰收，又要增加收入，回想过去，秦德林怎能不感慨呢！
    像秦德林这样的老弱孤寡社员，中捷友好农业生产合作社一共有一百零九户，一百九十人。这些人，在旧社会里，有的从小就失去父母，有的老年缺少子女，有的中年失去了丈夫或妻子。他们各人有各人不幸的遭遇，在旧社会里，过的是冰冷的岁月。在土地改革当中，他们虽然都分得了一分土地和农具，但是因为缺乏劳动力，收入不多，生活仍然赶不上一般农民，绝大多数人都离不了人民政府的救济。
    这些老弱孤寡户当中，完全丧失劳动力的有十三户，二十二口人，他们的衣、食、住完全由合作社包下来了。合作社保证他们吃得饱、穿得暖，有病给医治，死亡管埋葬。社里根据每户生活上的实际需要，把钱调拨到信用合作社。把粮食调拨到供销合作社。各户应得的钱、粮记在各户的名下，并发给证件，可以随用随取，不受一点限制。逢年过节，还多给一些，并且派专人去看望他们。社员金老九是个八十岁的孤老头子，去年入冬以后，他身体弱得不能动弹。社里派一个人专门照料他，给他做饭、洗衣服、生炉子取暖。他想吃点好的，社里就派人去买鲜肉，给他包饺子吃。老人感动得说：“做梦也没有想到我还会有这样幸福的晚年。”
    当我去访问七十多岁的梁李氏老太太的时候，她刚抱了一捆干柴回到家里，她让我坐下，转脸对领我去的社员于之中说：“老弟，还有一捆留在合作社的场院里，劳驾你替我背回来吧。”谁知话刚说完，社员张楷之已经把那捆干柴背进门来了。一种伟大的阶级感情深深地感动着我，我不知道怎样开始我的访问了。这时，梁老太太一把拉住我的手说：“同志，你看看，在毛主席的领导下，多好的人呵，多好的社呵！社里给我麦子、小米、高粮、花生、红薯、煤、柴……真是要什么有什么，有吃的，有用的……。”我要知道的事情，她一古脑儿都给说出来了。
    梁李氏是还能够从事些轻劳动的人，在社里像她这样的人是不少的。他们虽然大多数都年近七十，但有着长期从事劳动的习惯，现在还要作一些轻微的劳动。社大事多，有大活，有小活，有重活，有轻活。社里在进行生产安排的时候，总是把小活、轻活分配给他们做。比方，在进行春耕准备工作的时候，就让他们粒选种子、剥花生、扫街道土、拣粪；在夏季生产当中，就让他们到地里拔草、拣石头；在秋收时节，就让他们摘棉花、剥玉米。至于一些不能做农活的老太太，就组织她们到托儿所去帮助照看小孩子。这些老弱孤寡户在入社以前，有三十九户常年靠政府救济；入社以后，其中二十九户只靠自己的轻微劳动，就能够生活得满好了。据社里统计，这三十九户，今年生活开支约需三千二百九十二元，按社里给他们安排的轻微劳动应得的报酬计算，他们可以收入四千六百九十三元。应得的报酬超过了他们实际需要的开支。
    中捷友好农业生产合作社对老弱孤寡户无微不至的关怀，使他们觉得自己有了美满的归宿，他们的社会主义觉悟和劳动积极性大大提高了。很多老年人都主动找活干。七十多岁的社员张振平经常自动地上山背草沤肥料。前面提到的秦德林，1954年还被选为北京市的农业劳动模范。
