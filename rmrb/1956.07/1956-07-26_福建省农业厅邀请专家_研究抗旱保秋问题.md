Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, 24th. The Fujian Provincial Department of Agriculture invited agricultural experts in Fuzhou on the 22nd to discuss the cultivation techniques of crops in drought resistance.

    At the symposium, Lu Haoran, Dean of Studies of Fujian Agricultural College, analyzed the current growth and water requirements of various crops in Fujian Province, and expressed his opinions on the irrigation sequence, irrigation methods, and irrigation time of various crops. He emphasized that when drought has been detected in many areas of Fujian Province, while we must pay close attention to the summer planting of late rice and sweet potatoes, we must not ignore the current water use problems of economic crops such as jute and sugarcane.

    Lin Quan, Director of the Agronomy Department of the Fujian Provincial Agricultural Comprehensive Experimental Station, analyzed the most suitable time for transplanting continuous cropping late rice. He criticized the idea of some people who believe that late rice can still be transplanted until "Chushu" (the End of Heat), and that there are still many days before "Chushu", thus creating the thought of taking it slowly and waiting for rain. He said, according to our experiments: under the soil and climate conditions of Fujian, the later the transplanting after the "Dashu" (Major Heat) on the 23rd, the lower the yield. Therefore, we must do our best to fight drought now, and transplant where possible. We should not wait any longer.

    Professor Lin Jingliang of Fujian Agricultural College, who specializes in soil research, expressed his views on how to make full use of groundwater and how to minimize moisture evaporation in the fields. He said that some people have done experiments that tilling the field three times is equivalent to a small rain. We must attach importance to the role of inter-tillage and weeding in enhancing drought resistance.

    More than 20 other agricultural scientists who participated in the symposium spoke on water storage, water conservation, rational irrigation, crop mulching, spot watering to protect seedlings, prevention and control of diseases and insect pests, and the conversion of rice fields to other drought-resistant crops in drought resistance. The Fujian Provincial Department of Agriculture decided to pass on the opinions of these experts to various places for reference by cadres and the masses in drought resistance.

    福建省农业厅邀请专家
    研究抗旱保秋问题
    新华社福州24日电　福建省农业厅二十二日邀请在福州市的农业专家座谈在抗旱中农作物的栽培技术问题。
    座谈会上，福建农学院教务长卢浩然分析了福建省各种农作物目前生长情况、需水情况后，就各种农作物的灌溉次序、灌溉方法、灌溉时间等问题发表了意见。他强调说，在目前福建省不少地区已发现了旱象的时候，一方面固然要十分注意晚稻、甘薯的夏种问题，一方面也绝不能忽视黄麻、甘蔗等经济作物目前的用水问题。
    福建省农业综合试验站农艺系主任林权对连作晚稻应该在什么时候插秧最合适的问题作了分析，他批评了有些人认为晚稻到“处暑”还可插秧，而现在离“处暑”还有很多天，因而产生慢慢来等下雨的思想。他说，根据我们试验：在福建的土壤和气候等情况下，从二十三日“大暑”起，插秧越晚，产量越低，因此当前必须尽力抗旱，对可能插秧的地方就下插，不应该再等待了。
    福建农学院对土壤有专门研究的林景亮教授就如何充分利用地下水、如何尽量减少田里水分蒸发等问题发表了意见。他说，有人作过试验，田耙三次等于下一场小雨，我们要重视中耕除草对增强抗旱的作用。
    参加座谈的其他二十多位农业科学工作者在会上分别就抗旱中蓄水、保水、合理灌溉、农作物盖草、点浇保苗、防治病虫害以及水稻田改种其他抗旱作物等问题发表了意见。福建省农业厅决定把这些专家们的意见下达各地，供各地干部和群众在抗旱中参考。
