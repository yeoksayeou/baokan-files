Title: America Uses Asian People as "Sacrificial Offering"

In ancient times, people often used killing as a "sacrificial offering" before starting a war. Now, America is using Asian people as sacrifices for its preparations for a hydrogen bomb war. The crew of the Japanese "Lucky Dragon" and the peaceful residents of Bikini Island have already become victims of American hydrogen bomb tests, and now America is demanding that Asian people pay an even greater price for its war preparations.

Disregarding the strong protests from various countries against its hydrogen bomb tests on the high seas, the United States brazenly conducted a series of unannounced nuclear weapons tests in the Marshall Islands starting on May 21st. Although American officials have been trying their best to publicize that these tests were conducted under conditions that were "completely satisfactory from the point of view of public safety," radioactive nuclei produced by these tests were quickly discovered in India and Japan, posing a great threat to the people of India and Japan. American nuclear weapons tests have seriously endangered the safety of navigation on the high seas. The crew of the Iino Kaiun company's "Kunishima Maru," which returned to Yokohama port from Australia in early June, was examined by doctors and it was proven that the white blood cell count of 34 crew members had decreased by 500 to 1,000.

All of this is happening at a time when the international situation is definitely tending towards relaxation, and when the American government is increasingly issuing sweet words of peace-loving and willingness to respect the Asian people. The Asian people are, as a matter of course, strongly opposed to this American behavior that endangers Asian peace and the safety of Asian people.

Hirano Yoshitaro, Secretary-General of the Japan Peace Preservation Committee, and Yasui Iku, Secretary-General of the Japan Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs, met with Japanese Foreign Minister Shigemitsu Aoi in June, requesting the Japanese government to send a special envoy to the United States to urge the United States to stop hydrogen bomb tests in the Pacific. The Hiroshima Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs also sent a telegram to U.S. President Eisenhower, protesting the hydrogen bomb tests conducted on Bikini Island. Indian Prime Minister Nehru has recently repeatedly pointed out the dangers of hydrogen bomb tests and demanded that they be banned. Indian public opinion has also strongly protested against American hydrogen bomb tests.

Appeals for the United States to ban nuclear weapons tests have also come from within Britain and the United States. British Labour Party leader Bevan demanded that the US and British governments accept the Soviet proposal to cease all nuclear weapons testing. Stevenson, a candidate for the next US presidential election, advocated stopping US hydrogen bomb tests on Bikini Island. The Federation of American Scientists called on "the U.S. government to publicly declare its support for a universal ban" on testing nuclear weapons and intercontinental missiles.

However, the U.S. government has disregarded these protests and appeals. The U.S. Atomic Energy Commission announced that the U.S. will continue to conduct a series of "unannounced" nuclear weapons tests in the Pacific Trust Territory. Eisenhower wrote in a letter to the Nagasaki Council Against Atomic Bombs on June 21 that nuclear tests are important from the so-called "defense point of view" of the "free world," and the United States intends to continue conducting nuclear tests on the high seas.

But why does the United States have to come to the Pacific to "defend" its "free world"? The Asian people have not asked the United States to "defend" anything for them; what they demand is precisely the freedom from the fear of American hydrogen bomb tests, and what they want to defend is precisely the threat that this American war preparation brings to them. The fact is: Bikini Island is not American territory and is far from the American mainland. The U.S. government knows that no matter how many nuclear weapons tests are conducted in areas far away from its own country, and no matter how much danger these tests may pose, the people of the Pacific region will be the first to be affected by these dangers. This is why it disregards the protests of the Asian people and insists on continuing to test nuclear weapons in the Pacific. This is also what American politicians often boast about as "enlightened self-interest."

The United States is still continuing to conduct unannounced nuclear weapons tests on the high seas. This shows that the United States has no intention of easing international tensions, is determined to disregard the interests of the Asian people, and wants to use the Asian people as "sacrifices" for its nuclear weapons. This barbaric and inhuman behavior of the United States is intolerable. The Asian people will never allow the United States to use them as "sacrificial offerings." The United States must immediately stop nuclear weapons tests in the Pacific.

### 美国用亚洲人民“祭刀”

    美国用亚洲人民“祭刀”
    丁好德
    在古代，人们常常在进行战争之前用杀人来“祭刀”。现在美国也正在用亚洲人民作为它准备进行氢弹战争的祭品。日本“福龙丸”的船员和比基尼岛上的和平居民，已经成了美国氢弹试验的牺牲品，现在美国却要求亚洲人民为了它的战争准备付出更多的代价。
    美国悍然不顾各国人民对于美国在公海上试验氢弹的强烈抗议，从五月二十一日起在马绍尔群岛连续地进行了不加宣布的核子武器的试验。虽然美国官员竭力宣传这次试验是在“从公众安全的观点看来完全令人满意”的条件下进行的，但是在印度和日本很快就发现了这些试验所产生的放射性核子，给印度和日本人民带来了极大的威胁。美国的核子武器试验严重地危害了公海航行的安全。六月上旬从澳洲回到横滨港的饭野海运公司“国岛丸”的船员，经医生检查证明，有三十四个船员的白血球数目已经减少了五百到一千。
    这一切正发生在国际局势肯定趋于和缓的时候，发生在美国政府越来越多地发表爱好和平、愿意尊重亚洲人民等等甜言蜜语的时候。亚洲人民理所当然地强烈反对。美国这种危害亚洲和平和亚洲人民安全的行为。
    日本拥护和平委员会总书记平野义太郎和日本禁止原子弹和氢弹协议会事务总长安井郁等人，在六月里会见日本外务相重光葵，要求日本政府派遣特使到美国去促使美国停止在太平洋试验氢弹。广岛禁止原子弹和氢弹协议会也致电美国总统艾森豪威尔，抗议在比基尼岛举行的氢弹试验。印度总理尼赫鲁最近一再指出了氢弹试验的危害性，要求加以禁止。印度舆论也对美国的氢弹试验提出了强烈的抗议。
    要求美国禁止核子武器试验的呼吁还来自英国和美国内部。英国工党领袖比万要求美国和英国政府接受苏联提出的停止一切核子武器试验的建议。竞选下届美国总统的史蒂文森赞成停止美国在比基尼岛进行的氢弹试验。美国科学家联合会要求“美国政府公开申明支持普遍地禁止”试验核子武器和洲际导弹。
    但是，美国政府却不顾这些抗议和呼吁。美国原子能委员会宣布，美国要继续在太平洋托管地区进行一系列“不予宣布”的核子武器试验。艾森豪威尔在六月二十一日写给长崎禁止原子弹协议会的信说，从所谓“自由世界”的“防御观点”来看，核子试验是重要的，美国打算在公海上继续进行核子试验。
    但是，美国为什么要到太平洋上来“防御”它的“自由世界”呢？亚洲人民并没有要求美国来替他们“防御”什么东西，他们所要求的恰恰是免于对美国氢弹试验的恐惧的自由，他们所要防御的恰恰是美国这种战争准备所带给他们的威胁，事实是：比基尼岛不是美国的领土，距离美国本土很远。美国政府知道在距离自己国家很遥远的地区，不管进行多少次的核子武器试验，也不管这些试验会产生多大的危险，首先受到这些危险的是太平洋地区的人民，这才使得它不顾亚洲人民的抗议，坚持继续在太平洋上试验核子武器。这也就是美国政客们所常常津津乐道的所谓“开明的自我利益”。
    美国现在还在继续在公海上进行不加宣布的核子武器的试验。这就表明了美国无意和缓国际紧张局势，决心漠视亚洲人民的利益，要拿亚洲人民来给它的核子武器做“祭品”。美国这种野蛮的、不人道的行为是令人不能容忍的。亚洲人民决不容许美国拿他们来给它“祭刀”。美国必须立即停止在太平洋上进行的核子武器试验。
