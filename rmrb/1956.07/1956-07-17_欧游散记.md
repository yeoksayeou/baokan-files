    Street Musicians
    Amsterdam, Holland, has a world-renowned symphony orchestra, and the Dutch people love music.
    In Rotterdam or The Hague, one of the most striking things in Dutch cities is the hand-cranked barrel organ. This is probably like the windmills in the Dutch countryside, which can be regarded as a symbol. The difference is that many of the windmills in the countryside have completely become decorations. These windmills are no longer running, but as a scenery of the villa, the owner still maintains it very well. The hand-cranked barrel organ still often plays music on the streets to entertain guests from afar. Local people seem to have long been accustomed to it and don't pay much attention to it. This organ is like a hand-pushed cart, decorated with colorful pictures in the front, and one person cranks the handle to play some enthusiastic dance music. Another one or two people "donate" to passers-by. I say donate because they don't look like they are generally asking for "alms."
    But in some places, in addition to the hand-cranked barrel organ, you may encounter musicians who play in person instead of using machines. They are often disabled, playing folk tunes calmly or even indifferently with an accordion or other instruments, with a hat placed in front of them, waiting for passers-by to give alms.
Rotterdam's New Construction
    Rotterdam is a large port in the Netherlands. In this city, new houses and shops are being built in many places. It should be said that this is rare in Western Europe, and the Netherlands is also the country with the lowest prices and the most stable currency among the countries we have visited.
    One-color apartment houses were built along the highway. On a long street, the style of the houses, the doors and windows, and the color of the bricks and tiles... are exactly the same. Our French friend joked, "If a drunkard goes home late at night, he will not be able to find his door."

    街道上的音乐家
    荷兰的阿姆斯特丹有着世界著名的交响乐队，荷兰人民是爱好音乐的。
    在鹿特丹或者海牙，在荷兰城市中最惹人注目的事物之一便是手摇大风琴。这恐怕正像荷兰乡村的风磨一样，可以算是一种标志了。不同的是，在乡村的风磨有许多已经完全变成了装饰，这些风磨早已不开动了，但作为别墅的一个风景，主人还把它保养得很好。而手摇大风琴却仍然经常在街道上奏乐，来娱乐远道来的客人。本地人好像早已司空见惯了，并不太注意它。这种风琴像一个手推的车子，前面装饰着花花绿绿的图画，一个人用手摇着把手，奏出一些热烈的跳舞音乐。另外有一两个人向过路的人们“捐款”。我说是捐款，因为他们并不像一般的要求“布施”的样子。
    但在有些地方，除了手摇大风琴外，还会遇上不是用机械而是亲自演奏的音乐家，他们往往是残废人，用手风琴或别的乐器安详甚至漠然地奏一些民间曲调，脚前放着一顶帽子，等待过往行人的舍施。鹿特丹的新建设
    鹿特丹是荷兰的大港，在这个城市，不少地方在建筑着新的住宅和商店。应该说，这在西方欧洲是少见的事，而荷兰，也是我们所到的各国中物价最低、通货最稳的国家。
    公路旁建筑了一些一色的公寓房子，在长长的一条街上，房子的式样、门窗、砖瓦的颜色……完全一模一样。我们同行的法国朋友开玩笑地说：“如果万一有个吃醉酒的人夜深回家，将会找不到自己的家门”。
