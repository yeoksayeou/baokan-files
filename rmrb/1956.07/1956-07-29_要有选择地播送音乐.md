Do you like listening to records? It is a delightful thing to hear a satisfying music record or opera record. However, we often encounter the following kinds of things in some public places:

	During festivals adorned with red flags and colorful clothes, amidst the joyous crowds, we often hear the broadcast of "Eeyah, it's bitter..." from Peking Opera; in parks filled with vibrant spring scenery and throngs of tourists, "On New Year's Eve of that year, Mu Renzhi..." suddenly assails us; the deafening singing of "Knife me, axe chop me..." makes the gleeful and relaxed tourists both amused and embarrassed. Such phenomena occur frequently on trains and at other mass gatherings. During intermissions and breaks at cinemas and theaters, well-intentioned staff often broadcast music that is extremely uncoordinated with the plot of the drama, resulting in the disruption of the audience's emotions and the reduction of the performance's effect. These are truly some unnecessary interludes.

	I am by no means saying that these pieces of music have any shortcomings in themselves, because whether it is the folk and classical opera art of Peking Opera's "Su San Escapes" and Yue Opera's "Meeting at the Tower," or "The White-Haired Girl" and "Liu Hulan," which reflect the anti-feudal and anti-imperialist struggles, as well as some light music such as "Drizzling Rain and Flying Flowers" and "Little Peach Red," are all precious and needed by us. The problem lies in using them appropriately. The broad and rich life of the people cannot be simply summarized by a few fixed emotions. For example, at the "Exhibition for the Liberation of Taiwan," we certainly need to hear the song of heroic ambition like "Plant the Red Flag on Taiwan Island," but broadcasting "Women's Freedom Song" can also arouse our deep concern for our Taiwanese sisters living in dire straits. On National Day, we can certainly broadcast "Ode to the Motherland," but broadcasting some revolutionary songs from the War of Resistance Against Japan and the War of Liberation will equally inspire our revolutionary enthusiasm for the motherland and the cause of communism. … Today, as the musical life of the masses becomes increasingly rich and popular, attention should be paid to this kind of music that people come into contact with at all times in daily life. Units that broadcast music in public places should pay attention to selection; music groups and relevant units should also actively provide guidance and assistance.

    要有选择地播送音乐
    吴歌
    你喜欢听唱片吗？听到一张称心可意的音乐唱片或者戏曲唱片，是很愉快的事。可是，我们也常常在一些公共场所，遇到这样一类的事：
    在红旗和花衣裳交织的节日，在欢乐的人海中，我们常常会听到播送“咦呀呀，苦呀……”的京剧；在春光焕发、游人成群的公园里，“那一年年底三十晚，穆仁智……”会突然袭来；振耳欲聋的“刀杀我，斧砍我……”的歌声，更是使得兴高采烈和心情舒展的游人啼笑皆非。这类现象在火车上、在其它群众集会上也经常出现。在电影院、剧院的幕间和休息的时候，好心的工作人员也经常放送一些与戏剧情节极不协调的音乐，结果是破坏了观众的情绪，降低了演出效果。这真是一些不必要的插曲。
    我决不是说这些音乐本身有什么缺点，因为不论是京剧“女起解”、越剧“楼台会”这些民间的和古典的戏曲艺术；或者是反映反封建、反帝国主义斗争的“白毛女”“刘胡兰”，以及一些如“细雨飞花”“小桃红”等轻音乐，都是我们所珍贵和需要的，问题在于用得恰当。人民广阔而丰富的生活是不能用几种固定的情绪简单地加以概括的。譬如我们在“解放台湾展览会”上，固然需要听到像“把红旗插到台湾岛”这种雄伟壮志的歌声，但是放送“妇女自由歌”也可以激起我们对生活在水深火热中的台湾妇女同胞的深切关怀。在国庆日固然可以放送“歌唱祖国”，但放送一些抗日战争和解放战争时期的革命歌曲，同样会激励我们对祖国，对共产主义事业的革命热情。……在群众音乐生活日益丰富和普及的今天，对于这种日常生活中时刻为人们所接触的音乐是应该引起重视的。在公共场所放送音乐的单位应该注意选择；音乐团体和有关单位也应该积极主动地予以指导和帮助。
