What Does the Survey of Zhiyuan Village Show?
    -- The Rural Market Will Definitely Be Booming After Autumn This Year
    Zhou Jun
    Editor's Note: Currently, commercial workers have several different views on the market situation after autumn this year. Some believe that the market will not be booming, so there is no need to rush preparations; just wait and see. Others believe that farmers have great enthusiasm for production, and their purchasing power is mainly used for means of production, so they will not buy many consumer goods. The market may be active after autumn, but it may not be very booming, so there is no need to vigorously organize the supply of consumer goods. What will the rural market situation be like after autumn? We are willing to publish some survey materials here for commercial work comrades to study this issue; at the same time, we hope that comrades in charge of commercial work in various regions will provide us with more materials of this kind.
    Zhiyuan Village in Tongliao County, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, has a total of 322 households (213 poor peasant households, 70 middle peasant households, and 39 rich peasant and other households), 1,553 people, and 957 hectares of land. 312 peasant households have joined the cooperative, accounting for 97% of the total number of households. It is a village that has achieved full socialist cooperativization. Agricultural cooperativization has encouraged the farmers' enthusiasm for labor and confidence in increasing production. This year, grain production will increase by 7.05 million catties, an increase of about 60% compared to the actual production of the entire village last year. Each member's labor income will increase by 1.2 times compared to last year's actual income.

    Changes in Purchasing Power Distribution and Composition

    Due to the increase in labor income of members in Zhiyuan Village, purchasing power has increased significantly compared to last year. According to preliminary calculations, the total purchasing power of the village for the whole year is 151,717 yuan, an increase of 42.4% compared to last year, with an average of 89 yuan per person; of which, the public purchasing power belonging to the agricultural cooperative is 40,765 yuan, accounting for 26.8% of the total purchasing power, and the purchasing power of members' families is 110,952 yuan, accounting for 73.2%, with an average purchasing power of 71.4 yuan per person.

    Of the agricultural cooperative's public purchasing power, 89% is used for production and construction; 2.3% is used for stationery, rewards, etc.; and 8.7% is used for cultural and welfare aspects of the members. The quarterly distribution is: 8.35% paid in the first quarter; 8.84% in the second quarter; 39% in the third quarter; and 43.81% in the fourth quarter.

    In the purchasing power of the members' families, 4.2% of the total purchasing power of the members is used for production; and 95.8% is used for living materials, cultural goods, and personal construction. The quarterly distribution is: 18.2% paid in the first quarter; 16.8% in the second quarter; 21% in the third quarter; and 44% in the fourth quarter.

    This reflects that after agricultural cooperativization, farmers' personal purchasing power is mainly used to arrange their own lives, and this change becomes more prominent as time goes on.

          Rural Needs

    Due to increased agricultural production and increased purchasing power, significant changes have also taken place in rural needs:

    Public needs within the agricultural cooperative: After cooperativization, new production relations replaced the old production relations. Old-fashioned farm tools used by households will gradually be replaced by new-style farm tools. Therefore, new-style farm tools, power machinery, pesticides and agricultural machinery, large livestock, and large transportation tools have become the center of agricultural production needs. Small farm tools suitable for personal use have not decreased but have increased compared to before, some of which are purchased by the agricultural cooperative. In the second half of this year, there are plans to purchase 140 forks, 160 wooden rakes, 70 pockets, 150 sacks, 28 winnows and dustpans, and 120 brooms for autumn harvesting. In addition, in order to increase sideline income and improve the welfare of members, there is also an urgent need for improved breeds of livestock and poultry, building materials, and cultural and sports goods.

    Individual needs of members: This year, farmers' purchasing power is roughly divided into "production, food and drink, clothing, housing, and use." This year, the burden on production has been reduced, and most households will use it for clothing and housing. Some wealthy households want to buy some things to use.

    1.  Production aspect: After the agricultural cooperative transitioned to an advanced cooperative, means of production are mainly planned and purchased by the agricultural cooperative. Only hoes, rakes, spades, sickles, shovels, etc., used for personal production, are purchased by the members themselves. Because there are more people participating in labor, there are also more people using agricultural tools, and the purchase volume is large. According to the statistics of 20 households, each household buys an average of one hoe blade, one sickle, and one and a half straw hats. Two households buy one pickaxe, one sickle, one shovel, and one hand hoe, but they are not worth much. Member Zhao Xianting said, "After joining the cooperative, I don't add a cart or buy a horse. How much can buying a few small farm tools be worth?" This reflects that purchasing means of production is no longer the main burden of farmers who have joined the cooperative.

    2.  Food and drink: Because the distribution time of agricultural cooperatives is concentrated, farmers have a planned approach to spending money on weekdays. Farmers advocate for food and drink: "We can't just eat and drink heavily without the New Year or festivals. We spend all our money on festivals and make the New Year and festivals look like something." According to Zhao Xianting's plan (for two people), the annual need to purchase non-staple foods (excluding oil and salt) is 100 yuan, accounting for 10.1% of the total household purchases. Among them, the Spring Festival accounts for 50%, the Dragon Boat Festival and Mid-Autumn Festival account for 30%, and the usual days throughout the year account for only 20%. During festivals, there is a need for sugar, meat, wine, tea, aquatic products, condiments, and other types of food.

    3.  Clothing: "In recent years, we have lacked blankets and clothing, and we have been focusing on production. This year, after joining the cooperative, if the harvest is good, we have to buy some clothes," this is the general reflection of the farmers in Zhiyuan Village. According to the survey of 20 households (161 farmers), there are currently only 77 quilts and 37 mattresses. There are plans to purchase 25 quilts (an average of 1.2 quilts per household) and 18 mattresses after autumn. The amount of cloth used per person is 5 chi in spring, 8 chi in summer, 5 chi in autumn, and 17 chi in winter. Due to the increased use of cotton cloth and the increase in making quilts, the amount of cotton wadding has also increased from 1 catty per person in previous years to 1.5 catties.

    Male members need to wear short-sleeved vests, uniforms, and sneakers in summer, and绒衣,棉大衣,皮大衣,栽绒领棉袄,反毛布鞋,围巾,呢子帽,皮帽,皮手套等 in winter. Young women need to wear 花汗衫,花布衫,球鞋,水鞋 in summer, and 趟绒裤子,花夹袄,绒衣,栽绒领大衣,皮鞋,新头巾,绒手套 etc. in autumn and winter; the elderly, students, and children also have their own needs. In the first production team of Democratic Cooperative, which has 63 households and 350 people, there are plans to purchase 200 pairs of sneakers, 20 raincoats, 100 绒衣, 30 sheets, 20 皮大衣, 50围巾, 150背心, 100头巾, and 30皮帽 in the second half of the year. , The above are just a few items with generality, and young men and women also have plans to dress up more beautifully. For example, young woman Liu Guiying, her income is relatively high, and she plans to buy a 毛衣 suit, a pair of 皮鞋, a棉大衣, a 栽绒领棉袄, a 青华达呢棉裤, a 制服 suit, two 花汗衫, a pair of 球鞋, a pair of 绒手套, a头巾, and each a 趟绒裤子 and 花夹袄, six pairs of socks, and cosmetics worth about a hundred yuan. Meng Qingxiang is a 21-year-old young man. This year, his income is also relatively high. After the dividend, he plans to buy: a皮大衣, a 狗皮帽, a 华达呢棉衣 suit, a pair of 球鞋, a pair of 趟头牛, two pairs of 毡袜, a衬衣 suit, a 灯心绒裤, a夹袄, a pair of 绒手套, a皮带, two背心, a 呢帽, a 毛毡子, and each a 被褥, as well as other 毛巾,袜子 etc., worth about 200 yuan. Sun Lüshi is a middle-aged woman with three children. Her income this year is 200 yuan. After autumn, she plans to buy a 蓝士林旗袍, a 青棉袍, a 绒衣 suit, a pair of 球鞋, a头巾, a pair of 毡鞋, a面盆, a板柜, two 花棉衣 suits for children, two 绒帽, a斗篷, and two pairs of 毡疙瘩, worth a total of 102 yuan.

    4.  Living aspect: After improving their food and clothing, farmers want to improve their living conditions. This year, 98 households in Zhiyuan Village built houses, a total of 245 rooms, accounting for 18% of the total number of members' households and 70% of the total number of households that should be built. Among them, 91 rooms were built in the spring, accounting for 37%, and 154 rooms will be built after autumn, accounting for 63%. The construction standards are mostly seven purlins, 洋门 installed indoors, 风门 installed outdoors, new doors and windows are painted with lead oil, and glass is installed on the windows. Eleven households have already done this, and others look at them with envy and have ordered 200 catties of lead oil from the supply and marketing cooperative. In addition, a lot of wood, stone, 洋门,风门, glass, angle iron, handles, door bolts, door locks, nails, iron wire and other small hardware are needed. By next spring, the appearance of the houses will be completely new.

    5.  Usage aspect: With the improvement of food, clothing, and housing, farmers will inevitably increase the things they use. Among the 20 households surveyed, there are currently only three 炕琴, seven 板柜, and one 马蹄表. Most households lack boxes and cabinets, and pile packages on the kang. After autumn this year, seven households will buy boxes and cabinets, seven households will buy clocks and watches (two clocks and five 马蹄表), five households will paper the roofs, and five households will install stoves. In addition, one household will buy a radio, one household will buy a bicycle, and one household will buy a record player. Seven committee members of Qunli Cooperative and one member are preparing to buy a watch each, and some members are also buying some indoor furnishings.

    In addition, in terms of cultural and health products, due to the widespread development of the literacy campaign and the continuous promotion of rural cultural, educational, and health undertakings, the need for cultural and health products is also becoming increasingly urgent. For example, popular reading materials, cultural, entertainment, and sports goods, health and medical supplies, and supplies for eliminating pests, harmful birds, and harmful animals have become necessities for farmers.

      Changes in Rural Purchase and Sales Rules

    After agricultural cooperativization in Zhiyuan Village, the feudal production method was replaced by the socialist collective production method. With this reform, the old purchase and sales rules that used to be adapted to the individual economy have also undergone or are undergoing changes. Purchase and sales have shifted from unplanned to planned, and from decentralized to collective. The old habit of selling products whenever money is needed, "selling for buying," is no longer in line with the requirements of agricultural cooperatives. Because agricultural cooperatives are collective undertakings, without a plan for purchase and sales, it is impossible to reasonably organize production and improve management. Therefore, after the harvest of agricultural and sideline products, agricultural cooperatives sell them centrally, and then plan to purchase means of production, plan expenditures, and make overall arrangements for the year's production. All of the members' personal income, except for the distribution of food rations, firewood, vegetables, and other self-use products, is in cash, and the phenomenon of "selling for buying" no longer exists. In this way, farmers have to plan their expenses based on the dividend season, gradually developing the habit of planning income and planning expenditure.

    In addition, the farmers' transportation tools have been transferred to the cooperative. In order to reduce missed work and increase income, they are unwilling to go to the city or go to the market to buy things. Some bulky and less selective commodities such as salt, coal, wood, oil, rubber shoes, blue and white cloth, 绒衣 etc. are required to be purchased uniformly by the agricultural cooperative to save labor time. At the same time, due to the increase in purchasing power, some commodities such as coal, salt, and kerosene are willing to be purchased centrally by farmers for long-term consumption.

        Requirements for Commodity Quality

    As farmers' purchasing power increases, the requirements for commodities are that there should be more varieties, complete patterns, and good quality. The farmers in this village reflect on cloth: "青卡其 is not strong, 趟子绒 has short绒, thin hair, and sparse趟子; the patterns of 花布 are not complete, the colors are not new, they are not colorfast, and some 花布 will fade when they are put in water." Farmers reflect: "庄稼人 wear clothes that are new when you wear them, old in the same year, and have to be patched up next year, so it's better to use strong cloth." The hope for cotton cloth is: "The stripes should be even, the wefts should be uniform, the patterns should be more, and it should be strong and colorfast." The current habit of using cloth for farmers in this village is: 花布 accounts for 35%, 白布 accounts for 20%, and 色布 accounts for 45%. The reflection on 球鞋 is: the sponge sole is thin, easy to open glue, lacks磨垫, the five eyes are easy to fall off, and the shoe tips are too thin. I hope to produce 球鞋 suitable for farmers with big feet to wear. The reflection on 绒衣 is: there are too few specifications and the color is monotonous. I hope to increase the style according to the requirements of different ages. These are the inevitable results of the improvement of farmers' lives, which will of course bring more arduous tasks to the production department.

    From the survey material of Zhiyuan Village, it can be seen that in the first year of cooperativization, due to the increase in income and the increase in purchasing power, the commodities needed in the peak season after autumn are not only large in quantity but also good in quality, and the market will be very active at that time. According to the statistics of Zhiyuan Village, the realization of members' purchasing power accounts for 65% in the second half of the year, of which 21% accounts for in the third quarter and 44% accounts for in the fourth quarter. This shows that the peak commercial season is mainly in the fourth quarter.

    支援村的调查说明了什么？
    ——今年秋后农村市场一定会旺 
    周钧
    编者按：目前商业工作人员对今年秋后市场情况有几种不同的看法，有的认为今年秋后市场不会旺，不必急于作准备，看看情况再说；有的认为农民生产劲头很大，购买力主要用于生产资料，购买生活资料不会很多，秋后市场可能活跃，但不见得很旺，所以不必大力组织生活资料的供应。秋后农村市场情况究竟会怎样呢？我们愿意在这里发表一些调查材料，供商业工作同志研究这个问题；同时也希望各地负责商业工作的同志多给我们提供这一类材料。
    内蒙古自治区通辽县支援村共有322户（贫农213户，中农70户，富农及其他39户），1，553人，地957垧，入社农民312户，占总户数97％，是个实现全社会主义合作化的村庄。农业合作化鼓舞了农民的劳动热忱和增产信心，今年粮食增产将达到705万斤，比去年全村实产量增加60％左右，每个社员的劳动收入比去年的实际收入增加一点二倍。
    购买力分配及构成上的变化
    支援村由于社员劳动收入增加，购买力比去年增长很多，经初步计算，全村全年购买力是151，717元，比去年增加42.4％，每人平均为89元；其中属于农业社公共购买力的有40，765元，占总购买力26.8％，社员家庭购买力110，952元，占73.2％，每人平均购买力71.4元。
    农业社公共购买力用于生产、建筑方面占89％；用于文具、奖励等方面的占2.3％，用于社员文化福利方面的占8.7％。季度分配情况是：一季度支付占8.35％；二季度占8.84％；三季度占39％；四季度占43.81％。
    在社员的家庭购买力中，用于生产方面的占社员总购买力的4.2％；用于生活资料、文化用品和个人修建方面的占95.8％。季度分配的情况是：一季度支付占18.2％；二季度占16.8％；三季度占21％；四季度占44％。
    这里反映出农业合作化以后农民个人购买力主要用在安排自己的生活上，这个变化越往后越突出。
          农村需要情况
    由于农业增产和购买力提高，农村需要也发生了重大变化：
    农业社内公共需要的：合作化以后，新的生产关系代替了旧的生产关系，以户为单位使用的旧式农具将逐渐被新式农具代替，因之新式农具、动力机器、农药农械、大牲畜和大型交通工具，已成农业生产需要的中心。适合个人使用的小农具不但未减少反而较前增加，其中有一部分是由农业社购买的。今年下半年计划增购收秋使用的叉子一百四十把，木铣一百六十把，口袋七十条，麻袋一百五十条，箥箩、簸箕二十八个，扫帚一百二十把。此外为了增加副业收入，增进社员福利，也迫切需要优良畜种禽种、建筑材料、文娱体育用品等。
    社员个人需要的：今年农民在购买力的分配上大约分为“生产、吃喝、穿戴、居住、用等五方面”，今年生产方面的担子减轻了，大部分户要用在穿戴、居住方面。一部分富裕户要买些用的东西。
    一、生产方面：农业社转为高级社后，生产资料主要由农业社筹划购买，归社员购买的只有个人生产使用的镐头、耙子、锄头、镰刀、铁锹等。由于参加劳动的人多了，使用农具的人也增多了，购买量大。根据二十户的统计，平均每户买一张锄板、一把扇刀、草帽一顶半，两户买一张镐、一张扇刀、一把锹、一个手把锄，但值钱不多。社员赵显廷说：“入了社，一不添车，二不买马，买几件小农具能值几个钱。”这反映出购买生产资料已不是入社农民的主要负担。
    二、吃喝方面：由于农业社分配时间集中，使农民平时花钱有计划性。农民对吃喝是主张：“不能不过年不过节就大吃大喝，有钱都在节日花，把年、节过得像个样。”根据赵显廷计划（二口人）全年需要购买副食品（油、盐除外）为一百元，占家庭购买总额10.1％。其中春节占50％，端午节、中秋节占30％，全年平时仅占20％。节日需要糖、肉、酒、茶、水产、调料等类食品。
    三、穿戴方面：“这几年缺盖少穿的，光往生产上下力了，今年入社了，如收成好，可得好好置买点穿戴”，这是支援村农民普遍的反映。根据二十户（161个农民）的调查，现在只有七十七床被三十七条褥子，计划秋后购买二十五床被（平均每户一·二床）十八条褥子，每人穿衣用布春五尺、夏八尺、秋五尺、冬十七尺。由于棉布用量增加，做被褥的增多，絮棉也由往年每人一斤增为一斤半。
    男社员夏季要穿短袖背心、制服、球鞋，冬季要穿绒衣、棉大衣、皮大衣、栽绒领棉袄、反毛布鞋、围巾、呢子帽、皮帽、皮手套等。女青年夏季要穿花汗衫、花布衫、球鞋、水鞋、秋冬要穿趟绒裤子、花夹袄、绒衣、栽绒领大衣、皮鞋、新头巾、绒手套等；老年人、学生、儿童也是各有各的要求。在民主社第一生产队的六十三户三百五十人中，下半年计划购买球鞋二百双、雨衣二十件、绒衣一百件、床单三十条、皮大衣二十件、围巾五十条、背心一百五十件、头巾一百个、皮帽三十顶。以上只是带有普遍性的几种用品，青年男女还有打扮得美一些的打算。例如青年妇女刘桂英，她的收入是比较多的，她今年计划购买毛衣一身、皮鞋一双、棉大衣一件、栽绒领棉袄一件、青华达呢棉裤一条、制服一身、花汗衫二件、球鞋一双、绒手套一付、头巾一条、趟绒裤子花夹袄各一件、袜子六双、还有化妆品等约值百余元。孟庆祥是二十一岁的男青年，今年他的收入也是比较多的，分红后计划购买：皮大衣一件、狗皮帽一顶、华达呢棉衣一套，球鞋一双、趟头牛一双、毡袜二双、衬衣一身、灯心绒裤一条、夹袄一件、绒手套一付、皮带一条、背心两件、呢帽一顶、毛毡子一条、被褥各一条，及其他毛巾、袜子等，约值二百元左右。孙吕氏是已有三个小孩的壮年妇女，今年收入二百元，秋后计划购买蓝士林旗袍一件、青棉袍一件、绒衣一套、球鞋一双、头巾一个、毡鞋一双、面盆一个、板柜一个、小孩花棉衣二套、绒帽二顶、斗篷一个、毡疙瘩二双、共值102元。
    四、居住方面：农民改善了吃、穿之后，就要改善居住条件。支援村今年盖房的有九十八户，共盖房245间，占社员总户数的18％，占应盖房总户70％，其中春季盖九十一间占37％，秋后盖154间占63％。建设标准大多是七条檩、室内安洋门、室外安风门、新门窗上涂铅油，窗上安玻璃，现在已有十一户这样作了，别人看着羡慕眼热，已向供销社订购铅油200斤。此外还需要很多木材、石料、洋门、风门、玻璃、三角铁、拉手、门栓、门锁、钉、铁丝等小五金，到明年春天房屋面貌将焕然一新。
    五、使用方面：随着吃穿住的改善，农民对使用的东西也必然要增加。在调查的二十户中，现在只有三个炕琴、七个板柜、一个马蹄表，大部分户缺箱、少柜，把包袱堆在炕上。今年秋后有七户买箱买柜、七户买钟表（二个座钟五个马蹄表）、五户要裱糊屋棚、五户要安炉子。另外，还有一户要买收音机、一户买自行车、一户买留声机一架。群立社七个委员和一个社员准备各买一只手表，还有的社员买一些屋内陈设的东西。
    此外，在文化卫生用品方面，由于扫盲运动的广泛开展，农村文教、卫生事业不断推广，农民对文化、卫生用品的需要也日益迫切。例如通俗读物、文化、娱乐、体育用品、卫生医药用品和消灭害虫害鸟害兽用品，已成为农民的必需品。
      农村购销规律的变化
    支援村在农业合作化以后，封建的生产方式被社会主义的集体的生产方式所代替，随着这种改革，过去适应个体经济的旧的购销规律，现在也发生了或正在发生着变化，在购销上由无计划走向计划性，由分散走向集体性。过去那种什么时候要用钱，什么时候再卖产品“为买而卖”的旧习惯，已不符合农业社的要求。因为农业社是集体事业，在购销上没有计划，就不能合理的组织生产，和改进经营管理，因此农副产品收获后，农业社即集中出售，然后计划购买生产资料，计划开支，通盘安排全年生产。社员个人所得除分口粮、柴草、蔬菜等自用产品外，全部是现金，已不存在“为买而卖”的现象。这样农民在花钱上，不得不根据分红季节、计划自己的开支，逐渐养成计划收入计划支出的习惯。
    另外，农民的运输工具已入社，为了少误工多增加收入，都不愿进城或赶集买东西。一些笨重和挑选性不大的商品如食盐、煤炭、木材、油类、胶鞋、青白布、绒衣等，要求农业社统一购买，以节省劳动时间。同时由于购买力的提高，有些商品如煤、盐、煤油，农民都愿意集中购买，长期消费。
        对商品质量的要求
    农民的购买力提高了，对商品的要求是种类要多，花样齐全，质量要好。这个村农民对布匹的反映是：“青卡其不结实，趟子绒绒短、毛薄、趟子稀；花布花样不全，颜色不新，不保色，有的花布一下水就掉色。”农民反映：“庄稼人穿衣服，穿上新，当年旧，来年就得打补钉，要用结实布才好。”对棉布的希望是：“条要均，纬要匀，花样要多，坚固保色。”这个村农民目前的用布的习惯是：花布占35％，白布占20％，色布占45％。对球鞋的反映是：海棉底薄，好开胶，缺磨垫，五眼爱掉，鞋尖太瘦，希望生产适合农民大脚片穿的球鞋。对绒衣的反映是：规格太少，色泽单调，希望根据不同年龄的要求，增加式样。这些都是农民生活提高后的必然结果，这当然要给生产部门带来更繁重的任务。
    从支援村这个调查材料可以看出，农民在合作化的第一年，由于收入增加，购买力提高，秋后旺季需要的商品，不但数量多，而且质量好，那时市场将是十分活跃的。据支援村的统计，社员购买力的实现是下半年占65％，其中第三季度占21％，第四季度占44％。这说明商业旺季主要是在第四季度。
