Nanjing Exhibits Newly Discovered Taiping Heavenly Kingdom Stone Carvings

(Our dispatch) Several extremely precious Taiping Heavenly Kingdom stone carvings have been newly displayed in the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom History Museum in Nanjing. Among them, the most famous stone carving, the "Ferry Regulations Stele," was discovered in Taiyanghe Village, Jiangxinzhou, Dangtu County, Anhui Province. According to the inscription, the purpose of setting up this stele was "to warn the cunning and protect travelers," so that boatmen would not take the opportunity to extort money from passing merchants; the stele also inscribed the words "Any person without money, in case of emergency, must be ferried across immediately, even if it is only one person." This stone carving was erected on the thirtieth day of the twelfth month of the Jia Yin year (1854 AD) of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom. Another piece is the "Road Division Stele." In the center of the stele are two lines of regular script reading "Right to Xiang'an, Left to Hongjia Bridge." On the left side of the stone are the words "Taiping Heavenly Kingdom," Jiwei ninth year (1859 AD), Liang County, with clear and complete strokes. In addition, at the site of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom Heavenly King's Palace in Nanjing, the "Edict Stele" forehead, stele base, and two stone drums of the Heavenly King Hong Xiuquan were discovered. The discovery of these revolutionary cultural relics of high historical value is of great significance for the study of the history of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom and its transportation system.

    南京展出新发现的太平天国石刻
    本报讯　在南京市的太平天国历史纪念馆里，新陈列了几件极珍贵的太平天国石刻。其中最有名的石刻“渡船规条碑”，是在安徽省当涂县江心洲太阳河村发现的。从碑文上看，设置这块碑的目的是“以儆刁顽、以安行旅”，使船户对往来客商不得借机勒索；碑上还刻着“一凡无钱之人，有紧急事情务宜飞渡，虽系一人，亦须送去”的字样。这件石刻是太平天国甲寅四年（公元1854年）十二月三十日设立的。另一件是“分路碑”。碑正中是两行直书的楷字“右至襄安、左至虹家桥”，石左边是“太平天国”己未九年（公元1859年）梁县字样，字划清楚，完整无缺。此外，在南京太平天国天王府遗址，发现了天王洪秀全的“纶音碑”额、碑座及两只石鼓。这些历史价值很高的革命文物的发现，对研究太平天国的历史和交通制度都有重要意义。
