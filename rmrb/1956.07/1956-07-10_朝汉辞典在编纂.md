    Korean-Chinese Dictionary Being Compiled

    (Our Dispatch) Beijing – The Department of Oriental Languages at Peking University is currently compiling a Korean-Chinese dictionary. The compilation work is now entering the stage of collation and revision. The Korean-Chinese dictionary will be the first common dictionary in the history of China and North Korea.

    After two and a half years of hard work, the Korean-Chinese Dictionary Compilation Committee has collected 45,000 lexical items for this dictionary. Some of the lexical items were collected from Korean language teaching in the Department of Oriental Languages and Chinese language teaching in the Peking University Foreign Students Language Training Program, and some were collected by graduates of the Korean Language Department in practical work. These lexical items will be able to meet the needs of the people of China and North Korea in conversation, translation, and other areas.

    The Korean-Chinese dictionary compilation work is directly led by Korean expert Professor Liu Lie, and has received the help of Chinese Chinese linguist Professor Wei Jiangong.

    朝汉辞典在编纂
    本报讯　北京大学东方语文系正在编纂一部朝汉辞典。现在编纂工作进入整理和修改的阶段。朝汉辞典将是中朝两国历史上第一次出现的共用的辞典。
    朝汉辞典编纂委员会经过两年半的辛勤劳动，为这个辞典搜集了四万五千个语汇。其中一部分语汇是在东方语文系朝鲜语教学和北京大学外国留学生语文专修班的汉语教学中搜集的，也有朝鲜语科毕业生在实际工作中搜集的。这些语汇将能够满足中朝两国人民会话、翻译等需要。
    朝汉辞典编纂工作是由朝鲜专家柳烈教授直接领导的，并得到了中国汉语学家魏建功教授的帮助。
