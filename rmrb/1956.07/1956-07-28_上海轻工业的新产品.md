New Products of Shanghai Light Industry

		Three New Types of Pencils
	Shanghai pencil workers, recently, based on the needs of industrial construction and requests from the people's letters, manufactured three new types of pencils.
	Blueprint Pencils　Terrain surveying and geological exploration in basic construction projects require blueprint pencils to draw blueprints in order to shorten drawing time and achieve the goal of quick drawing and quick printing.
	China Pencil Factory No. 2 used domestic raw materials to produce the 5410 blueprint pencil. The lead is hard and black, with the property of blocking light. This pencil is available in three types: hard, medium, and soft. It can replace generally imported drawing pencils, and the price is also cheaper than imported goods.
	Masses Pencils　China Pencil Factory No. 1, without affecting the quality of writing, reduced the pencil's shaft and lead to create a small and exquisite new product—the 561 Masses Pencil. The cost of this pencil is 30% lower than that of ordinary pencils, and the price is low, meeting the needs of the broad masses of people.
	Red and Blue Pencils　In the past, the leads of red and blue pencils were half of each color, which did not meet the actual needs of red leads being used more and blue leads being used less. Based on letters from the people, China Pencil Factory No. 1 changed the length of the red lead to two-thirds and the length of the blue lead to one-third. The outside of the pencil shaft is also painted to indicate the length of the two colors of lead.
	After this new product was sold in the Shanghai market this spring, it was welcomed by customers. (Xu Wei)
	
	Ideal Shoes for Athletes
	Athletes all hope to have a pair of relatively ideal sports shoes. The designers of Shanghai Dahua Rubber Factory No. 1 designed three new sports shoes based on opinions from all sides.
	Standard Sports Shoes　These shoes are comfortable and fit well. There is no degumming phenomenon when walking or jumping rapidly. The sponge sole of the shoe has good elasticity and has the effect of cushioning and shock absorption. The surface of the outsole has meticulously designed patterns, which are both wear-resistant and prevent slipping. The welt has a high rubber content, is soft, and has a large elongation. The shoe upper is made of canvas and is not easily broken.
	After the standard sports shoes were trial-sold, they were also welcomed in foreign markets.
	Lightweight Sports Shoes　These are sports shoes suitable for tennis and badminton players. Its characteristics are that the style conforms to the shape of the foot, the sponge sole is soft and comfortable, the outsole is wear-resistant, the welt is resistant to bending, and it is light and fast to walk in, meeting the needs of lightweight sports.
	Microporous Outsole Sports Shoes　These are trial-produced according to Czech-style sports shoes. It uses a specially made porous rubber material as the interlayer. The characteristics are that it is light and comfortable to wear, the outsole is wear-resistant, and it has a shock-absorbing effect, so it is suitable for athletes to wear.
	This relatively high-grade sports shoe has begun to be launched on the market in the second quarter.
	
	Newly Launched Thermos Bottles
	Thermos bottles specially produced for farmers　Now, thermos bottles are commonly used in rural areas. However, farmers have many opinions on thermos bottles, mainly because they are too small in capacity, and because the thermos bottles are thin and long, they are not stable when placed on the ground and are easily broken.
	In response to these shortcomings, the workers of the Shanghai Thermos Bottle Factory specially designed a seven-pound short bamboo shell thermos bottle for the farmer brothers. This thermos bottle is very stable when placed in the fields. The farmer brothers were moved when they used this thermos bottle and said, "The worker elder brothers really think of us so considerately!"
	Insulated Food Container　There is a large-mouthed thermos bottle that, in addition to being used as an ice bottle, can also hold an "insulated food container." This was specially designed by the technical personnel of Shanghai Guangda Thermos Bottle Factory for the working people. The food container is divided into four compartments. The large compartment can be used to hold rice, and the three small compartments can hold dishes, enough for two people to eat. Putting the food container into a large-mouthed thermos bottle can keep it warm for twenty-four hours.
	With this large-mouthed thermos bottle that can hold an "insulated food container," no matter how far the factory or office is from home, you can eat hot dishes and hot rice made for you by your family at any time.
	"Small Refrigerator"　Indian friends call a twenty-pound large thermos bottle produced in Shanghai a "small refrigerator."
	This "small refrigerator" can store meat, fruits, and ice cubes in tropical areas. In cold areas, it can be used as a small warm storage warehouse, and even at minus 50 degrees Celsius, it can ensure that the things stored inside do not freeze. Mobile medical teams can use it to store medicines that cannot withstand heat or cold.
	This "small refrigerator" is also welcomed by Soviet friends.
	
	Good News for Ball Game Enthusiasts
	Plastic Badminton Shuttlecock　In summer, how pleasant it is to play badminton on the green grass or on the quiet beach! In the past, due to the poor quality of badminton shuttlecocks, it was often disappointing: the feathers of the badminton shuttlecock would fall off after being hit.
	Shanghai Jiu'an Badminton Ball Industry Cooperative has recently successfully trial-produced a badminton shuttlecock made of plastic. It is softer and more elastic than ordinary badminton shuttlecocks, is not affected by cold, heat, or humidity, and has a very long service life. Moreover, this badminton shuttlecock can be produced by machines instead of by hand, which can unify specifications and increase output.
	With this badminton shuttlecock, of course, the unpleasant thing of the feathers falling off will not happen.
	"Chinese-made" Tennis Balls　Playing tennis is a very good sport. But in the past, tennis balls were all imported and very expensive. Now, Shanghai Central Rubber Factory has successfully trial-produced tennis balls and has begun formal production.
	The tennis balls produced by this factory have been tested and proved to have very good elasticity and roundness. At present, the workers of this factory are still working hard to improve the quality and strive to have "Chinese-made" tennis balls on the international market in the near future.
	Sprayed Small Leather Balls　Small leather balls are one of the children's favorite toys; they can be patted or kicked; they can be played indoors or outdoors. However, in the past, the colors of leather balls were very monotonous, either white or red. Before Children's Day this year, Shanghai Yonghe Rubber Factory specially designed a colorful sprayed ball with bright colors for children. Some of the balls are sprayed with patterns of national style, and some are sprayed with animal patterns, which are very beautiful and make people like them at first sight.
	These patterns are sprayed on with a sprayer, and the patterns can be changed at will. Moreover, it is operated by machines and can be produced in large quantities.

    上海轻工业的新产品
                       三种新式铅笔
    上海制笔工人，最近根据工业建设的需要和人民来信的要求，制造了三种新式铅笔。
    晒图铅笔　基本建设工程的地形测量、地质勘探等工作，都需要晒图铅笔绘晒蓝图，以便缩短绘图时间，达到快画快晒的目的。
    中国铅笔二厂采用国产原料，制成5410式晒图铅笔，笔芯硬而黑，具有遮蔽光线的性能。这种铅笔分硬、中、软三种。可以代替一般进口的绘图铅笔，价格也比进口货便宜。
    大众铅笔　中国铅笔一厂在不影响书写质量的前提下，把铅笔的笔杆和笔芯改细，制成一种小巧玲珑的新产品——561式大众铅笔。这种铅笔比一般铅笔的成本降低30％，售价低廉，符合广大人民的需要。
    红蓝铅笔　过去红蓝铅笔的铅芯，两种颜色各半，不符合红铅芯用途广、蓝铅芯用途小的实际需要。中国铅笔一厂根据人民来信，把红铅芯的长度改为三分之二，蓝铅芯的长度改为三分之一。笔杆外面也用油漆把两种颜色的铅芯长度标志出来。
    这项新产品在今年春季的上海市场上销售以后，受到了顾客的欢迎。　（徐炜）
    运动员们理想的鞋子
    运动员们都希望有一双比较理想的球鞋。上海大中华橡胶一厂的设计人员，根据各方面的意见，设计了三种新球鞋。
    标准球鞋　这种球鞋穿在脚上舒适服贴，急剧行走或跳跃时不会有脱胶现象。鞋的海棉底弹性好，有缓冲和防震荡的作用。大底表面有经过周密设计的花纹，既耐磨，又能防止滑动。沿条含胶量高，柔软，伸长力大，鞋帮是帆布的，不易折断。
    标准球鞋试销以后，连在国外市场也受到欢迎。
    轻量运动鞋　这是适合打网球、羽毛球的运动员们穿着的球鞋。它的特点是式样符合脚型，海棉底柔软舒适，大底耐磨，沿条耐弯曲，穿着后行走轻快，适合轻量运动的需要。
    微孔大底球鞋　这是按照捷克式球鞋试制的。它用特制的多孔胶料做夹底的。特点是穿着轻便，大底耐磨，而且有防震荡的作用，所以适宜运动员们穿着。
    这种比较高级的球鞋，在二季度已经开始上市。
    新上市的热水瓶
    专为农民生产的热水瓶　现在农村里面普遍用上热水瓶了。但是农民们对热水瓶有不少意见，其中主要是嫌容量小，加上热水瓶又瘦又长，摆在地上不平稳，容易打碎。
    上海的热水瓶厂工人针对这些缺点，特地为农民兄弟设计了一种七磅的矮形竹壳热水瓶。这种热水瓶摆在田野间，很平稳。农民兄弟用到这种热水瓶时都感动地说：“工人老大哥为我们想得真周到！”
    保暖饭格　有一种大口的热水瓶，除了可以当冰瓶外，还可摆下“保暖饭格”。这是上海光大热水瓶厂技术人员特地为劳动人民设计的。饭格分四格，大的一格可以用来盛饭，小的三格可以盛菜，够两个人吃的。将饭格放进大口热水瓶，可以保暖二十四小时。
    有了这种可以放“保暖饭格”的大口热水瓶以后，不管工厂、办公室离家多远，随时都可以吃家里给你做的热菜热饭。
      “小冰箱”　印度朋友把上海出品的一种二十磅大热水瓶叫做“小冰箱”。
    这种“小冰箱”在热带地方可以储藏肉类、水果和冰块。到了寒冷地方又可以当一个小暖藏库，即便在摄氏零下五十度，也可以保证里面储藏的东西不结冰。巡回医疗队就可以用它来装不能抗热或抗冷的药品。
    这种“小冰箱”，也受到苏联朋友的欢迎。
    球类爱好者佳音
    塑胶做的羽毛球　夏天，在碧绿的草地上，或者在宁静的海滨打打羽毛球，是一件多么愉快的事！过去，由于羽毛球质量不高，常常令人扫兴：羽毛球打出去以后，羽毛飞掉了。
    上海久安羽球工业社，最近试制成功了一种用塑胶做的羽毛球。它比一般羽毛球柔软，富于弹性，不受气候冷热潮湿的影响，使用寿命很长。而且，这种羽毛球可以用机器代替手工生产，能统一规格，提高产量。
    用这种羽毛球，当然不会发生羽毛飞掉那种不愉快的事情了。
      “中国制”的网球　打网球是一种很好的运动。但是过去的网球都是进口的，价格很贵。现在，上海中央橡胶厂已经试制网球成功，并且开始正式生产。
    这个厂生产的网球，经过鉴定，证明弹性及圆度都很好。目前，这个厂的工人还在努力提高质量，争取在不久的将来，国际市场上有“中国制”的网球。
    喷花的小皮球　小皮球是孩子们最喜爱的玩具之一；可以拍，也可以踢；可以在室内玩，也可以在室外玩。但是，以前皮球的花色很单调，不是白的，就是红的。今年六一儿童节前夕，上海永和橡胶厂特地为孩子们设计了一种颜色鲜艳的喷花彩球。球上面有的喷上民族风格的图案，有的喷上动物图案，非常漂亮，使人看了就喜欢。
    这种花纹是用喷雾器喷上去的，可以随心所欲地变更花样，而且是用机器操作，可以大批生产。
