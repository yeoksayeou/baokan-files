Shandong Province is actively carrying out the prevention and control of endemic diseases. In the first half of this year, eight special district hygiene and epidemic prevention stations have been established throughout the province, and thirty-six county hygiene and epidemic prevention stations have been established in areas with more serious endemic diseases. Hygiene clinics have been universally established and improved in various districts. Most areas held endemic disease prevention and control training classes in the first quarter. In Dingtao County alone, 1,374 agricultural cooperative health workers were trained. Spraying (with "666" agent) to kill sandflies for the prevention of kala-azar has been launched among the broad masses. The Shandong Province Kala-azar Prevention and Control Institute is conducting investigations and research on sandflies in Tai'an County, aiming at the living habits of sandflies, and studying more effective methods of killing them. The Heze Prefectural Commissioner's Office convened a kala-azar prevention and control work conference to study prevention and control guidelines and methods and formulate specific prevention and control plans for each county.

In addition, the Shandong Provincial Patriotic Health Campaign Committee is establishing a base point in Gaomi County to create experience in eliminating hookworm disease. It has sent a hookworm disease prevention and control research team to conduct epidemiological investigations and research on hookworm disease, guide farmers in improving composting and fertilization methods, and research and experiment with traditional Chinese medicine to treat hookworm disease.

    本报讯　山东省积极进行地方病的防治工作。今年上半年已在全省建立了八个专区卫生防疫站，并在地方病流行较严重地区建立了三十六个县卫生防疫站，普遍建立和健全了各区卫生所。大部地区在第一季度都举办了地方病防治训练班。仅定陶一个县就训练了一千三百七十四名农业社保健员。在广大群众中展开了预防黑热病的喷药（“六六六”药剂）灭蛉工作。山东省黑热病防治所正在泰安县作白蛉虫的调查研究，针对白蛉的生活习性，研究更有效的杀灭方法。菏泽专署曾召开了黑热病防治工作会议，研究了防治方针方法并制定了各县的具体防治计划。
    此外，山东省爱国卫生运动委员会为创造消灭钩虫病的经验，正在高密县设立基点，派出钩虫病防治研究组作钩虫病流行病学的调查研究工作，并指导农民群众改善堆肥、施肥方法，还研究试验用中医中药治疗钩虫病的办法。
