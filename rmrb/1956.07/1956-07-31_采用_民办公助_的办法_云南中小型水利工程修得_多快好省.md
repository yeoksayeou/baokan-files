    By adopting the method of "Publicly Run with Government Assistance,"
    Yunnan's Small and Medium-Sized Water Conservancy Projects are Built "More, Faster, Better, and More Economically"
    (Our newspaper Kunming dispatch) Yunnan Province has now completed more than 145,000 small and medium-sized water conservancy projects, capable of irrigating 3,040,000 mu of paddy fields. In the construction of water conservancy projects, various regions, by adhering to the principle of relying on the masses and "Publicly Run with Government Assistance," have saved state investment and achieved the requirements of being more, faster, better, and more economical. After overcoming the masses' reliance mentality, Rongfeng County expanded its irrigated area by more than 104,000 mu, completing 103% of the task. In the 7,122 completed projects, the state investment was less than 10%. The masses said with satisfaction: "In previous years, we couldn't build them even with money, but this year we're doing it even without money." Under the slogans of "Every Township Builds Water Conservancy, Every Cooperative Transforms Land" and adhering to the principle of running cooperatives diligently and thriftily, the masses have created many instances of doing things more, faster, better, and more economically. When Yuxi Second District was building the Longwo Dam, there was insufficient funding. The water conservancy committee members and the masses worked together to find solutions, utilizing old stones, wood, scrap copper, and scrap iron, saving a total of more than 2,700 yuan in expenses and more than 23,500 labor days.
    Due to the construction of water conservancy projects, many mountainous areas have begun to change their original impoverished appearance. In Nanhanzhuang Township, Baoshan County, the entire township was short of 800,000 jin of grain in 1953. Now, not only does it not require the government to supply grain, but it also sells 860,000 jin of surplus grain.

    采用“民办公助”的办法
    云南中小型水利工程修得“多快好省”
    本报昆明电　云南省现已完成中、小型水利工程十四万五千多项，可以灌溉三百零四万亩水田。各地在兴修水利中，由于坚持了依靠群众“民办公助”的原则，节约了国家投资，实现了又多、又快、又好、又省的要求。榕峰县克服群众依赖思想后，全县扩灌面积十万四千多亩，完成任务103％；在完成的7，122件工程中，国家投资还不到10％，群众满意地说：“往年有钱修不好，今年无钱也要搞。”在
  “乡乡修水利、社社地改田”和坚持勤俭办社的口号下，群众创造了许多又多、又快、又好、又省的事迹。玉溪二区修龙窝坝的时候，经费不足，水利委员和群众一起找窍门，利用旧石、木料、废铜烂铁等，共节约经费二千七百多元，劳动力二万三千五百多个。
    由于兴修水利，许多山区开始改变了原来贫困的面貌，保山县南汉庄乡，1953年全乡缺粮八十万斤，现在不但不要政府供应粮食，还卖出余粮八十六万斤。
