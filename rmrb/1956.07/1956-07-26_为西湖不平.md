Title: In Defense of West Lake

As someone who grew up in Suzhou, it’s only when my hair has turned white that I finally visit West Lake, and this alone is enough to show that I am a hopelessly ordinary person. It so happened that when I visited, it was early this year, precisely when West Lake was being dredged, exposing half the lakebed. Even if I wanted to feign elegance, the objective conditions weren't there. My way of touring was even worse. I hired a car and a guide, rushing along as if on a mission. Looking back on this joyless approach, the memories are naturally joyless as well. So why even bother writing about it? It’s because, despite West Lake not exactly welcoming me, I want to speak out on its behalf. I speak out because I feel it’s treated unfairly. “Let a hundred flowers bloom,” and hopefully that can encompass these words of mine; it’s good to speak out.

The joyless words stem from joyless events. Of course, I must first preface by saying that the joyless events might be due to the perception of a joyless person. When it comes to beauty, it’s hard to avoid subjectivity, which easily leads to subjectivism. If someone wants to label me with that, I have no complaints.

To complete the visiting mission, the guide chose the most economical route for me: getting off at "Autumn Moon over the Calm Lake," going around behind Gushan, and arriving at Xiling Bridge. Lingering at the bridgehead for a while, then taking the car to Yue Fei Temple, and returning to the hotel. The most economical meant seeing the most historical sites in the shortest amount of time. We really did see quite a few historical sites: one could almost count a dozen graves. Back at the hotel, sitting down, I announced my conclusion to the guide with a sense of discovery: West Lake is actually a cemetery, and this cemetery has a certain standard, uniformly earthen mounds, without cement or concrete.

This joyless conclusion greatly surprised my guide. I knew he wanted to say, "You really are a philistine with a low level of understanding." But he was well-mannered and helpful, not wanting to label me, and patiently tried to help me understand. So he explained the reasoning to me in a roundabout way. The reasoning was this: The beauty of West Lake lies in its embrace of the beautiful people and events accumulated throughout history. The people love the poems of Bai Juyi and Su Dongpo, and this affection has transformed into Bai Causeway and Su Causeway. The people admire Lin Bu's unwillingness to serve the feudal dynasty, which has transformed into the plum blossoms and cranes on Gushan. Even the anti-feudal hero Wu Song has been brought to West Lake to be commemorated. And then there are the great women, from Su Xiaoxiao, who sacrificed for love, to Qiu Jin, who sacrificed for the revolution, both forever remaining on West Lake. West Lake is an epic poem, including even the patriotic Yue Fei. He paused here, the words unspoken, but I could hear the unspoken question: "How can you only see earthen mounds?"

So that's how it is, a real awakening! But these words made me feel sorry for West Lake. Such a rich West Lake, why adopt this cemetery form for its presentation? I can't help but say that I loved reading Manshu's poems when I was young, but seeing his earthen mound with a memorial archway this time greatly diminished my previous image of him as being very free and unrestrained. Not to mention Wu Song, let's talk about Su Xiaoxiao. In that red-lacquered pavilion, there’s half a globe and a wire mesh cage that should be used for rabbits, and does that really represent her as a deeply affectionate and unwavering female archetype? Even more unforgettable is the utterly bureaucratic bodhisattva-like statue of Yue Fei, and that row of Yue Fei paintings and calligraphies like those from a Huiquan Mountain toy store. Who with discerning eyes could see even a trace of patriotic heroic spirit there?

Hearing me say this, the guide's composure was tested. He stood up abruptly: "These are historical sites, this is national form! You want to destroy them?" I wasn't aware of the internal situation; it turned out there was a story behind it. I had inadvertently touched on his concerns. "This is a struggle, do you agree with those who want to destroy historical sites?"

Absolutely not. I may be a philistine, but after the guidance of someone with genuine affection and understanding for West Lake, even a stubborn rock would nod in agreement. To regard West Lake merely as a natural landscape is to degrade its value. No one can disagree with him that West Lake is a comprehensive image created by the people of past generations through vivid stories. We can hardly imagine a West Lake without Lin Bu, Su Xiaoxiao, or even Wu Song and Yue Fei. These are its flesh and blood. But, forgive me for still needing to use these two words to transition the text, besides burying corpses, are there no other images to represent these beautiful people and events? Is it that our people’s wisdom cannot create other vivid images that are more closely related to beautiful people and events to express our affection for them? This is where I feel it’s unfair.

Once I started talking, my lack of composure became even more apparent, and I couldn't help but stand up as well.
“Whoever sculpted Yue Fei into such a vulgar and low-level bureaucrat is committing a crime, an insult to our national hero! I will definitely shout everywhere, shout until this clay idol is torn down!”

Visiting West Lake and becoming red-faced is certainly worthy of being called joyless. To those who advocate that the historical sites of West Lake must be kept intact, even if demolished they must be rebuilt in their original form, these words are also joyless.

But who killed the scenery? Is it me or someone else? I think it can't be said to be boring to argue about this question.

Our words were not congenial, and we turned to the window. The moonlight was hazy, and West Lake was very calm. It is determined to enter socialism, and West Lake will definitely become more beautiful.

### 为西湖不平
费孝通

    为西湖不平 
    费孝通
    作为一个苏州长大的人，要到头发花白才去访游西湖，只这件事已够说明我是个凡俗入骨的人了。也真巧，轮到我去访游的时候，那是今年年初，又正是西湖下装的时节，露出了半个湖底。我即使要充风雅也没有客观条件。我的游法更不对头，借了辆汽车，请了位指引人，匆匆地有些像赶任务。这种杀风景的搞法，追记起来自然不免都是些杀风景的话了。这样说来，还要追什么记呢？那是因为尽管西湖不大欢迎我，而我却替西湖要抱不平。不平则鸣。“百家争鸣”想来能包容我这些话，说说也好。
    杀风景的话起于杀风景的事。当然，还得先打招呼，杀风景的事可能由于杀风景的人看出来的。一牵涉到美不美，大概离不了主观，也就容易有主观主义。如果有人扣我这个帽子，毫无怨言。
    为了赶访游任务，指引人替我选择了一条最经济的路线，从“平湖秋月”下车，绕孤山后面，到西泠桥。桥头盘桓一下，坐车去岳王庙，回旅馆。最经济的意思是从最短时期看到最多古迹为标准。古迹可真看到不少：不妨屈指数一数，差不多有一打的坟。我回到旅馆，坐定了，似乎有所发明地向指引人发表了我的结论，西湖原来是个公墓，而且这个公墓还有一个规格，一律是土馒头，洋灰水泥或是三合土。
    这个杀风景的结论引得我的指引人不胜惊讶，我知道他想说，你真是个凡夫俗子，水平低。可是他的修养好，态度好，不扣帽子，耐心地要帮助我。于是他委宛地讲给我听了一番道理。道理是这样：西湖的美，美在它包容了历史上积累的美人美事。人民爱好白居易和苏东坡的诗，这点感情化成了白堤和苏堤，人民爱林和靖的不甘心服务于封建王朝，化成了孤山上的梅妻鹤子。甚至为了纪念反封建的英雄把武松都拉来西湖，还有，伟大的女性，从为恋爱而牺牲的苏小小，到为革命而牺牲的秋瑾也永远留在西湖上。西湖是一首史诗，包括爱国主义的岳飞在内。他说到这里，停了一下，话没有出口，可是我听出了他吃住的声音，“你怎么只看见些土馒头呢？”
    原来如此，真是顿开茅塞。可是这番话却使我为西湖抱不平了。这样一个内容丰富的西湖，为什么采取了这个公墓形式来表现呢？我不能不说了，我小时候很喜欢读曼殊的诗，但这次一见到他这个土馒头加上一个华表，把我原有关于他很洒脱的形象，打了一个很大的折扣。且不提武松，说苏小小吧，那个红漆的亭子里，半个地球模型，还有一个应该是罩兔子用的铁丝网，在那一点上表示出了她是个一往情深，坚贞不拔的女性典型？更使人忘不了的是那个十足官僚菩萨型的岳王塑像，和那一排有如惠泉山玩具铺里的岳王字画，那个慧眼能看出一丝爱国主义英雄气魄来？
    我这一说，指引人的修养受到了考验。他勃然而起：“这是古迹，这是民族形式。你想把它们毁了？”我不摸内情，原来其中确有文章。我无意中触到了他的心事。“这是个斗争，你也同意那些要毁坏古迹的人么？”
    决无此意。我固然是个凡夫俗子，但是经过那位对西湖有真感情、真体会的指引人一番指点，顽石也点了头。把西湖只看成一个自然的风景是贬低了西湖的价值。谁也不能不同意他，西湖是历代人民用活生生的故事所创造出来的一个综合形象。我们很难想像出一个没有林和靖、苏小小、甚至武松、岳王的西湖。这些是它的血肉。但是，恕我还是不能不用这两字转一下文气，除了埋葬了尸体之外，就没有其他形象来表示我们这些美人美事了么？难道我们人民的智慧里创造不出了其他和美人美事更联系得密切的生动形象来表达我们对他们的感情了么？这是我的不平处。
    我话说开了，原来缺乏修养，到这里更是禁不住，也站了起来。
  “谁把岳飞塑成那样庸俗的低级官僚，是犯罪，是对我们民族英雄的侮辱！我一定要四处叫喊，叫喊到把这个泥菩萨拆掉为止。”
    访游西湖，游得面红耳赤是够得上说是杀风景了。对于那些主张必须把西湖古迹原封不动，甚至拆了还要原样翻修的人，这些话也是杀风景的。
    但是谁杀了风景？是我还是别人？在这个问题上争争鸣，我想也不能说是无聊的。
    我们话不投机，转身向窗外，月色朦胧，西湖很沉着，它是有决心进入社会主义的，西湖一定会更美。
