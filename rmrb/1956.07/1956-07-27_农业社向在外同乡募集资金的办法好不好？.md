    Is the method of agricultural cooperatives raising funds from fellow villagers working outside good?

    Some agricultural production cooperatives in Hunan, Liaoning, Hebei, Henan and other provinces have adopted the method of soliciting donations or loans from fellow villagers working outside in order to solve the difficulty of insufficient funds.

    From April to now, this newspaper has successively received letters from many officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, cadres of government agencies, and workers of factories and mines regarding this issue. They have received donation letters from agricultural cooperatives in their hometowns; some agricultural cooperatives have also specified the amount of money they want, sometimes as high as hundreds of yuan; some have also set a deadline for remittances, and written "Please do not refuse under any circumstances." This makes them very embarrassed: If they remit the money, they are unable to do so; if they do not remit the money, they are afraid that the masses in their hometown will say that they do not support the cooperative movement. They ask: Is this practice of agricultural cooperatives good or not? Is it right?

    We believe that the funding problem of agricultural cooperatives should be solved from the following aspects: (1) Collect a certain amount of share capital from the members; (2) Retain a certain amount of public accumulation fund from the annual income of the whole cooperative; (3) Mobilize the members to invest in the cooperative voluntarily according to their own strength. In addition, when necessary and possible, loans can also be obtained from the National Bank and credit cooperatives. Through these methods, engaging in production and operation under the principle of diligence and thrift in running the cooperatives, the funding problem can be solved. At present, the reason why some agricultural cooperatives have insufficient funds is mainly because political work and economic work are not done well; some members are unwilling to invest in the cooperatives; some agricultural cooperatives have insufficient funds because they violate the principle of diligence and thrift in running the cooperatives, blindly pursuing ostentation and extravagance, and setting up a big stall.

    In general, the method of soliciting donations and loans from fellow villagers working outside is not entirely appropriate. Relying on donations makes it easy to relax one's own efforts; borrowing too much from outside places heavy debt on the cooperatives, which is also not good. Creating an atmosphere of "not sending money is not supporting the agricultural cooperation movement" to put pressure on people is even worse. Of course, supporting the cooperative movement is everyone's responsibility. In fact, many officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, cadres of government agencies, and workers of factories and mines have systematically supported the agricultural cooperation movement under the organization and leadership of their units. If individual agricultural cooperatives go to them to randomly request economic assistance, even setting quotas and deadlines, this will cause difficulties for some people. Because these people's current income is not very high; generally speaking, they all have family burdens, and their lives are not very affluent. People in agricultural cooperatives may not be very aware of this; they think that everyone working outside has a lot of spare money. This is a misunderstanding.

    Of course, some comrades do have spare money and voluntarily support agricultural production cooperatives, which should still be encouraged; it is also very good for the family members of some staff members who are members of the cooperative to send the savings back home to invest in the cooperative. However, from the perspective of agricultural production cooperatives, it is best not to blindly raise funds from outside, but to rely on their own efforts and give full play to their own potential. Only in this way can the superiority of the cooperative be truly demonstrated.

### 农业社向在外同乡募集资金的办法好不好？

    农业社向在外同乡募集资金的办法好不好？
    湖南、辽宁、河北、河南等省有些农业生产合作社，为了解决资金不足的困难，采取了向在外工作的同乡募捐或借款的办法。
    从四月到现在，本报陆续收到不少解放军官兵、机关干部、厂矿职工等写的有关这个问题的来信。他们接到了家乡农业社的募捐信；有些农业社还指定了要钱的数目，一要就是上百元；有的还限定了汇款的时间，并且写着“无论如何请你不要拒绝”。这使得他们很作难：汇款去吧，无能为力；不汇款吧，怕家乡的群众说他们不支援合作化运动。他们问：农业社的这种作法究竟好不好？对不对？
    我们认为：农业社的资金问题，应该从以下几个方面解决：（一）向社员征集一定数量的股分基金；
  （二）从每年全社的收入中留出一定数量的公积金；（三）发动社员在自愿原则下按照自己的力量向社里投资。此外，在需要和可能的情况下，还可以向国家银行和信用合作社贷款。通过这些办法，在勤俭办社的原则下从事生产经营，资金问题是可以解决的。目前有些农业社的资金不足，主要原因是政治工作和经济工作做的不好，有些社员不愿向社投资；有些农业社则资金不足，是因为违反了勤俭办社的原则，盲目地讲排场、摆大摊子。
    在一般情况下，那种向在外同乡募捐和借款的办法是不尽妥当的。把希望寄托在捐款上，就容易放松本身的努力；向外过多借款，使合作社负债很多，也不好。造成一种“不寄钱来就是不肯支援农业合作化运动”的空气来压人，更不好。当然，支援合作化运动，这是人人有责的。事实上，许多解放军官兵、机关干部、厂矿职工，都在他们所在的单位的组织和领导下，有计划地支援了农业合作化运动。如果个别农业社再去随便向他们要求经济上的援助，甚至限额、限期，这就会使有些人感到困难。因为这些人目前的收入也不是很多；一般地说，他们大都有家庭负担，生活并不怎样宽裕。农业社的人对于这一点可能不很了解，他们以为所有在外边工作的人都有很多余钱。这是一种误解。
    当然，有些同志确实有余钱，自愿支持农业生产合作社，那还是应当鼓励的；有些工作人员家里的人是社员，把节余的钱寄回家里向合作社投资，也是很好的。不过，从农业生产合作社方面来说，最好不要盲目向外募集资金，而应当自力更生，充分发挥本身的潜力。只有这样，才能真正表现出来合作社的优越性。
