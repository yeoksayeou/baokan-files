Every country in the world has customs offices at its border crossings. However, the nature and role of customs varies from country to country. The socialist nature of our country determines that our customs serves the people and socialism. It has three basic tasks: cargo supervision, combating smuggling, and collecting tariffs.

The main purpose of customs supervision of goods is to check whether goods entering and leaving the country have been approved by the state. Specifically: imported goods, from the time they enter the country until they are released by customs, and exported goods, from the time they are declared to customs until they are shipped out of the country, must be actually supervised by customs based on state-approved licenses, strictly verifying whether the goods are consistent with the licenses. Customs will not allow goods without licenses or inconsistent with licenses to be imported or exported. In addition to goods, customs must also conduct necessary supervision of gold and silver currency, passenger luggage, postal items, and means of transport entering and leaving the country. Every year, more than 10 million tons of goods enter and leave the country under customs supervision, and the number of passenger luggage and postal items is also very large. It is conceivable that this supervisory work of customs is very heavy. In the past few years, customs offices across the country have cracked down on tens of thousands of illegal profit-making and sabotage activities caused by illegal bourgeois elements at home and abroad, such as false declarations, substitutions, and tax evasion. They have exposed and corrected many errors and accidents that occurred in the work of state-owned import and export companies and due to the irresponsibility of some staff. This specifically illustrates that customs supervision is one of the guarantees for the implementation of the state's foreign trade control policy and an important tool for protecting domestic economic construction.

The import and export of goods is a very complex task. Various accidents are prone to occur during transportation and port loading, unloading, handling, and storage. If the goods are damaged as a result, then even if the import and export of the goods is approved by the state, the purpose of foreign trade cannot be achieved or cannot be fully achieved. Therefore, in addition to supervising that the import and export of goods must be approved by the state, customs must also supervise the loading, unloading, storage, handling, storage, and packaging of goods at the ports. If it discovers backlogs, damages, mis-deliveries, and all other cargo accidents that have caused or are likely to cause state losses, customs must expose them and urge relevant departments to correct them. In recent years, due to the rapid development of our country's foreign trade, the volume of import and export cargo has been increasing. Customs has exposed nearly 10,000 cargo accidents every year, greatly reducing the state's losses. Because this work is becoming more and more important to socialist economic construction, the Ministry of Foreign Trade officially listed it as one of the basic tasks of customs in April 1955.

In order to more closely safeguard our socialist construction, customs must also fight against all kinds of smuggling activities. Of course, this work cannot be done by customs alone. According to the Provisional Customs Law, customs is responsible for combating smuggling at customs locations—that is, places open to foreign trade where goods, passengers, postal items, and means of transport are allowed to enter and leave the country. As for the anti-smuggling work on the long border line, it is mainly the responsibility of border defense and public security departments. With the help of the broad masses, customs and other agencies across the country have cracked down on more than 100,000 smuggling cases in recent years, many of which are very serious in nature. In some cases, more than 1,000 smuggled watches were seized at one time. As for the smuggling of precious cultural relics, gold and silver currency for export, and the smuggling of counterfeit currency, substandard goods, and high-end consumer goods for import, the harm to our socialist construction is even more obvious. In recent years, smuggling cases combined with political sabotage have been increasing, such as smuggling explosives and radio telegraph machines for import, which deserves our special vigilance.

The collection of tariffs is of great significance for protecting national production, promoting the development of foreign trade, and enriching national fiscal revenue. According to our country's tariff policy and the current customs import and export tariff regulations, customs only levies very low tariffs or exempts tariffs on imported equipment and materials needed for socialist construction. However, for the same imported goods that are already produced domestically, especially some luxury goods, customs will levy relatively high to very high tariffs. For export goods, except for peanuts, peanut oil, menthol and peppermint oil, all are exempt from tariffs to support the development of export trade. The collection of tariffs can regulate the quantity of imported and exported goods and adjust the prices of goods. Especially for private parcels and passenger luggage (referring to the part that should be taxed), the regulatory role of tariffs is particularly significant. The tariff rates of the current customs tariff are divided into two types: the minimum tariff rate and the ordinary tariff rate. The minimum tariff rate applies to goods from countries that have trade mutual benefit treaties or agreements with our country, and the ordinary tariff rate applies to goods from countries that do not have trade mutual benefit treaties or agreements with our country. Tariff revenue is one of the sources of funds for socialist construction. It should not be assumed that foreign trade is now basically monopolized by the state and that tariffs have no role to play.

In 1950, Chairman Liu Shaoqi said at the cadre meeting celebrating "May Day" in Beijing: "Imperialism has been driven out of China, and many privileges of imperialism in China have been abolished. The new China's customs policy and foreign trade policy have become important tools for protecting the development of new China's industry. This means that we have put the key to China's door in our own pockets, instead of in the pockets of imperialism and its running dogs as in the past. From now on, Chinese industry will not be subject to the competition of cheap goods from imperialism, and Chinese raw materials will first be supplied to the needs of its own industry. This has removed one of the biggest obstacles that have prevented Chinese industry from developing for a hundred years." I have a relatively deep understanding of Chairman Liu Shaoqi's words, because I worked in the old Chinese customs for 34 years before liberation. In the past few years after liberation, thanks to the education and training of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government, I have also assumed important leadership work in the People's Customs. I know very well the differences between the nature and role of the new and old customs. In the past few years, I have written several articles criticizing the old Chinese customs. Now, in this nationwide jubilation, socialist construction has entered a climax, especially after I recently inspected the Northeast and was very excited to see the rapid socialist construction in the Northeast, on the days of the Third Session of the First National People's Congress, I remembered Chairman Liu Shaoqi's words above and couldn't help but write this article. I am deeply honored and happy to be able to serve the People's Customs in my later years. I hope that all customs staff across the country can attach importance to their work, be conscientious and dedicated, and complete the glorious task of safeguarding the country's economic gate. I believe that under the correct leadership of the Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and with the support and cooperation of the people of the whole country and local party and government organs and relevant departments, we will be able to do customs work better and enable customs to play a greater role in socialist construction.

    我们的海关在社会主义建设中起什么作用
    对外贸易部海关总署副署长　丁贵堂
    世界上任何一个国家，都在它的国界交通孔道上设有海关。但是，各国海关的性质和作用却是多种多样的。我们国家的社会主义性质决定了我国的海关是为全国人民、为社会主义服务的。它有三大基本任务：货运监管、查禁走私和征收关税。
    海关监管货物的主要目的，是为了检查进出国境的货物是不是已经过国家的批准。具体说来就是：进口货从运入国境起到由海关放行止，出口货自向海关报运起到运出国境止，都要由海关根据国家批准的许可证件进行实际的监管，严格地核对货物是不是和许可证件相符。凡是没有许可证件或者同许可证件不符的货物，海关就不准它们进出口。除货物外，海关对进出国境的金银货币、旅客行李、邮递物品、运输工具，也要进行必要的监管。每年在海关监管下进出国境的货物都在一千万吨以上，旅客行李和邮递物品的数量也很大。可以想像，海关的这个监管工作是很繁重的。在过去几年中，全国海关取缔了数以万计的由国内外不法资产阶级分子所造成的伪报、顶替、偷漏等非法牟利行为和破坏行为，揭发和纠正了国营进出口公司工作中和某些工作人员不负责任而发生的许多错误事故，具体地说明了海关的监管工作是国家对外贸易管制政策能够贯彻执行的保证之一，也是保护国内经济建设的重要工具之一。
    货物的进出口是一件很复杂的工作，在运输途中和口岸装卸、搬运、保管等过程中极易发生各种事故，如果因此而使货物遭受损失，那末，即使货物的进出口是经过国家的批准，也还不能达到或不能完满地达到对外贸易的目的。因此，海关除了要监督货物的进出口必须经过国家批准外，还必须监督货物在口岸上的装卸、保管、搬运、储存和包装等工作。如果发现了积压、残损、错发错运以及其他一切已经造成或足以造成国家损失的货运事故，海关就要揭发，并督促有关部门加以纠正。最近几年，由于我国对外贸易的迅速发展，进出口的货运量日益增大，海关每年都揭发了近万件的货运事故，大大减少了国家的损失。由于这个工作对社会主义经济建设越来越重要，对外贸易部已在1955年4月把它正式列为海关的基本任务之一。
    为了更严密地保卫我国社会主义建设，海关还必须和各种走私行为进行斗争。这个工作当然不是海关一个机关能够做好的。根据暂行海关法的规定，海关负责在设关地点——也就是开放对外贸易，允许货物、旅客、邮递物品、运输工具进出国境的地点——查禁走私，至于在漫长的国境线上的查私工作，则主要由边防、公安部门负责。在广大群众的帮助下，几年来全国海关和其他机关查获的走私案件，总数在十万件以上，这里面有不少案件的性质是十分严重的。走私进口的手表，有的一次就在一千只以上。至于偷运珍贵文物、金银货币出口和偷运假人民币、次货劣货、高级消费品等进口，对于我国社会主义建设的危害性更是十分明显。近年来，和政治破坏相结合的走私案件日渐增多，如偷运爆炸物和无线电报机进口等等，特别值得我们提高警惕。
    征收关税对于保护国家生产，促进对外贸易的发展，充裕国家财政收入都有重要的意义。根据我国关税政策和现行海关进出口税则的规定，对于社会主义建设所需要的进口的器材设备，海关只征收很低的关税或者免税；但对于国内已有生产的同样的进口货品，特别是一些奢侈品，海关就要征收比较高以至很高的关税；对于出口货物，除了花生、花生油、薄荷脑和薄荷油四种外，都是免征关税，以扶助出口贸易的发展。征收关税能调节进出口货物的数量，能调整货物的价格，特别是对于私人邮包、旅客行李（指应该付税的部分），关税的调节作用特别显著。现行海关税则的税率分为最低税率和普通税率两种：最低税率适用于来自同我国有贸易互利条约或协定的国家的货物，普通税率适用于来自同我国没有贸易互利条约或协定的国家的货物。关税收入为社会主义建设资金的来源之一。不能以为目前对外贸易已基本由国家专营，关税就没有什么作用了。
    刘少奇委员长1950年在北京庆祝“五一”节干部大会上曾说过：“帝国主义已经从中国赶走，帝国主义在中国的许多特权已经被取消，新中国的海关政策与对外贸易政策已经成为保护新中国工业发展的重要工具。这就是说，我们已把中国大门的钥匙放在自己的袋子里，而不是如过去一样放在帝国主义及其走狗的袋子里。从今以后，中国工业就不致受到帝国主义的廉价商品的竞争，中国的原料将首先供给自己工业的需要。这就扫除了一百年来使中国工业不能发展的一个最大的障碍。”我对刘少奇委员长这段话有着比较深刻的理解，因为在解放前我曾在旧中国海关工作了三十四年，解放后这几年，由于中国共产党和人民政府的教育和培养，在人民海关中又担负了重要的领导工作，我对新旧海关的性质和作用的不同是知道得很清楚的。过去几年，我曾写过几篇批判旧中国海关的文章；现在，在这全国欢腾，社会主义建设进入高潮，特别是我在最近到东北视察非常兴奋地看到东北的突飞猛进的社会主义建设后，在第一届全国人民代表大会第三次会议开会的日子里，我又想起刘少奇委员长上面这段话，就情不自禁的写了这一篇文章。我深深为我能在晚年为人民海关服务而感到光荣和幸福。我希望全国海关工作人员都能重视自己的工作，兢兢业业，完成保卫国家经济大门的光荣任务。我相信在中央、毛主席的正确领导下，在全国人民和各地党政机关及有关部门的支持配合下，我们是能够把海关工作做得更好，使海关在社会主义建设中发挥更大的作用。
