Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, July 6th. Since April, workers in the processing and casting workshops of twenty-one machinery factories in Shenyang have launched intra-trade competitions, resulting in significant improvements in production efficiency and product quality.

　　The workers in twenty-five processing workshops and seventeen casting workshops of various machinery factories have paid particular attention to improving product quality during the competition. The inspectors and workers of the Seventh Workshop of the Shenyang Water Pump Factory signed a "Worker-Inspector Contract" to ensure mutual assistance and prevent the production of defective products. Inspector Gao Yunting worked with the fitters to study pump assembly issues, reducing rework from 15% to 7%. In the casting workshop of the Shenyang No. 2 Machine Tool Factory, workers summarized and promoted the experience of the Ma Youche group, which had consistently produced high-quality castings for several months, during the competition. The scrap rate of castings in the entire workshop has now fallen below the national standard. After this workshop was selected as a model workshop in Shenyang, casting workshops in factories throughout the city sent people to learn from their experience. Currently, the product quality of twelve of the seventeen casting workshops in the city has significantly improved, with the scrap rate of nine of these workshops decreasing month by month.

　　During the competition, the production efficiency of various processing workshops also continued to increase. Workers in the standard workshop of the Shenyang No. 2 Machine Tool Factory replaced the old closed heads with Vlassov closed heads, increasing processing efficiency threefold. After studying and mastering advanced Soviet experience, workers in the "1A62" processing workshop of the Shenyang No. 1 Machine Tool Factory generally exceeded the national design quotas.

    沈阳市二十一个机械工厂的加工、铸造车间
    开展同工种竞赛提高了产量质量
    新华社沈阳6日电　沈阳市二十一个机械工厂的加工、铸造车间职工，从四月份开展厂际同工种竞赛以来，生产效率和产品质量有显著提高。
    各机械工厂的二十五个加工车间和十七个铸造车间的职工，在竞赛中特别注意改进产品质量。沈阳水泵厂七车间的检查员和工人签订了“工检合同”，保证互相帮助，防止产生废品。检查员高云亭同钳工组工人研究装泵问题，使返修品由15％降低到7％。沈阳第二机床厂铸造车间职工，在竞赛中总结和推广了几个月来铸件质量一贯优良的马有彻小组的经验，全车间的铸件废品率已经降到国家规定指标以下。这个车间被选为沈阳市模范车间以后，全市各个工厂的铸造车间，都派人去学习他们的经验。现在，全市十七个铸造车间有十二个车间的产品质量显著提高，其中九个车间的废品率月月下降。
    在竞赛中，各加工车间生产效率也不断提高。沈阳第二机床厂标准车间工人，把旧闭头改用弗拉索夫闭头，加工效率提高了三倍。沈阳第一机床厂“一A六二”加工车间工人，学习和掌握了苏联先进经验以后，普遍突破了国家设计定额。
