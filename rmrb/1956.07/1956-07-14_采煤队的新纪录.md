Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, July 12th: The "May Fourth" coal mining team of the Hongshan Coal Mine in Zibo, which has been continuously exceeding its quota, created a new record of an average daily output of 10.86 tons of coal per person in early July, more than one and a half times higher than the average daily output per person in December last year.

This coal mining team, which uses a coal cutter to mine thin coal seams, has been overfulfilling the state production tasks every month since the advanced producer movement was launched in January this year, and all workers have exceeded their quotas. The achievement of such remarkable results is mainly due to their promotion of nine advanced experiences such as rapid coal cutting and rapid transfer of coal cutting machines, which has resulted in a balanced increase in the efficiency of all types of work.

The "May Fourth" coal mining team has now been rated as an advanced collective unit in the entire mine and has been successively rewarded by the Ministry of Coal Industry and the Zibo Mining Bureau.

    采煤队的新纪录
    据新华社济南12日电　连续突破定额的淄博洪山煤矿“五四”采煤队，七月初旬创造了每人平均日产十点八六吨煤的新纪录，比去年十二月份每人平均日产量提高了一倍半以上。
    这个在薄煤层用截煤机采煤的采煤队，从今年一月份开展先进生产者运动以来，月月超额完成国家生产任务，全部工人都突破了定额。这样显著成绩的获得，主要是他们推广快速截煤、快速移运煤机等九种先进经验，使各工种的效率均衡提高的结果。
    “五四”采煤队现在已经被评为全矿的先进集体单位，并先后受到煤炭工业部和淄博矿务局奖励。
