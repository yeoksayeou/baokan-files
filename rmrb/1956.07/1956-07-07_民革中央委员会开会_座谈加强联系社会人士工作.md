Xinhua News Agency, 6th. The Central Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang (RCCK) held a symposium on the afternoon of July 4th to discuss the issue of contacting social figures.

Regarding the question of which types of people to contact, Shao Lizi's opinion was: the main focus of contact should be former military and political personnel from the middle and upper classes. Individual lower-level personnel with greater influence can also be contacted, and those in business and industry, as well as practitioners of traditional Chinese and Western medicine, with whom relationships have already been established need not be discontinued. But Dan Maocheng and Pei Changhui believed that regarding the requests of social figures for learning opportunities and job introductions, etc., their urgent need for learning should be satisfied as much as possible. If they wish to participate in social work, such as street work and the literacy campaign, the RCCK organizations should assist them in finding solutions.

Participants in the symposium also raised the hope that the issues of funding and cadres for contacting social figures could be resolved.

Li Jishen, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, stated that the RCCK Central Committee will consider the many issues raised at the meeting, so that the work of contacting social figures can be further improved and strengthened in the future.

    民革中央委员会开会
    座谈加强联系社会人士工作
    新华社6日讯　中国国民党革命委员会中央委员会于七月四日下午座谈联系社会人士工作问题。
    关于联系那一类人的问题，邵力子的意见是：联系对象以中上层旧军政人员为主，个别的影响较大的下层人员，也可以联系，已经有了关系的工商界和中西医也不必中止。但懋辛和裴昌会对于社会人士要求学习和介绍工作等问题，认为：应该尽量满足他们对学习的迫切需要，如希望参加社会工作像街道工作和扫盲运动等，民革组织应该协助他们求得解决。
    参加座谈会的人还提出希望解决联系社会人士的经费和干部问题。
    中国国民党革命委员会中央委员会主席李济深表示，会上所提出的许多问题，民革中央都将加以考虑，使得联系社会人士的工作，今后得以进一步的改进和加强。
