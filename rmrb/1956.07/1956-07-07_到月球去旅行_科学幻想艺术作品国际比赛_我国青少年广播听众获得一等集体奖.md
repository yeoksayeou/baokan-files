Chinese Young Radio Listeners Win First Prize as a Group

According to Xinhua News Agency on the 6th, Chinese young radio listeners participated in the "Traveling to the Moon" international science fiction art competition organized by the Belgrade Radio Station in Yugoslavia and won the first prize for the group.

"Traveling to the Moon" is an international competition initiated by the Belgrade Radio Station in Yugoslavia at the beginning of this year, inviting radio listeners from various countries to participate. The competition method is to use drawings or models to express the imagination of "Traveling to the Moon". After receiving the invitation, the Central People's Broadcasting Station of China organized twenty-nine students who love natural science and literature and art from three schools, including the Middle School Affiliated to the Central Academy of Fine Arts, the Middle School Affiliated to Beijing Normal University, and Beijing No. 25 Middle School, to collectively create a set of comic strips to participate in the competition.

This set of comic strips has a total of seven pictures. It depicts the imaginary International Juvenile Space Travel Association organizing children from various countries to fly to the moon on a rocket on the "June 1st" International Children's Day in 1975 and holding a get-together there. This set of pictures vividly depicts the scene on the moon. At the same time, it also well expresses the spirit of internationalism and national characteristics.

    “到月球去旅行”科学幻想艺术作品国际比赛
    我国青少年广播听众获得一等集体奖
    据新华社6日讯　我国青少年广播听众参加南斯拉夫贝尔格莱德广播电台主办的“到月球去旅行”科学幻想艺术作品国际比赛，获得集体奖一等奖。
    “到月球去旅行”是南斯拉夫贝尔格莱德广播电台在今年年初发起的邀请各国广播听众参加的一项国际比赛。比赛方法是用图画或模型来表现“到月球去旅行”的想像。我国中央人民广播电台接到邀请以后，组织了中央美术学院附设中等美术学校、北京师范大学附属中学和北京市第二十五中学等三个学校二十九个爱好自然科学和文学艺术的同学集体创作了一套连环画参加比赛。
    这套连环画一共七幅，它描绘了想像中的国际少年星际航行协会在1975年“六一”国际儿童节组织各国少年儿童乘火箭飞到月球上并且在那里举行联欢的情形。这套图画很生动地表现了月球上的情景。同时，也很好地表现了国际主义精神和民族特点。
