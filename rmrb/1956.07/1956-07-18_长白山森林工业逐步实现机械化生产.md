    Xinhua News Agency, Changchun Electric Dispatch. The six forest industry bureaus in the Changbai Mountain forest area, which have long relied on manual production, have been successively using a large number of electric saws, tractors, electric cranes, automobiles, and self-assembled electric winches, diesel winches, and other machinery manufactured by countries such as the Soviet Union, the German Democratic Republic, and Czechoslovakia since the beginning of this year. Now, three forest industry bureaus have basically achieved mechanized production. The other three bureaus are constantly increasing the proportion of mechanization and will also basically achieve mechanized production within this year.
    Mechanized production not only reduces labor intensity for workers but also ensures production safety. In the past, eight or ten workers were needed to carry a heavy log up the high-altitude planks. Workers were in danger of slipping, being crushed to death, or being injured if they were not careful. Now, it is very safe to use an electric winch to stack the selected timber high.
    Mechanized production also increases the utilization rate of wood. In the past, due to the small manpower for loading and transporting wood, heavy wood was often sawn into sections on the mountain before being transported down the mountain for timber production, which often resulted in the wood not meeting the specifications for timber production. Now, thanks to the use of mechanical transportation, the entire tree can be loaded and transported down the mountain.
    Changbai Mountain is a famous forest industry area in our country, producing a large amount of timber every year to meet the needs of national economic construction. The timber planned to be harvested this year is increased by more than 298,000 cubic meters compared with last year. In the first half of this year, the timber harvested by machinery accounted for 27.2% of the total harvest.

### 长白山森林工业逐步实现机械化生产

    长白山森林工业逐步实现机械化生产
    新华社长春电　长久以来一直用人工生产的长白山森林地区的六个森林工业局，从今年年初以来，陆续地使上了苏联、德意志民主共和国、捷克斯洛伐克等国家制造的大批电锯、拖拉机、电动起重机、汽车和我国自装的电动绞盘机、柴油绞盘机等机械。现在，已经有三个森林工业局基本上实现了机械化生产。另外三个局正在不断扩大机械化比重，也将在今年内基本上实现机械化生产。
    机械化生产不仅减轻工人劳动，而且保证了生产的安全。过去需要八个或十个工人抬着一根沉重的大圆木走上通往高处的踏板，工人们稍不小心就有滑倒被砸死和压伤的危险，现在用电动绞盘机把选择好的木材高高地垛在一起，就很安全了。
    机械化生产还提高了木材的利用率。过去由于人力装运木材力量小，往往把沉重的木材在山上锯成几节再运下山来造材，这样，就往往使木材不合乎造材的规格。现在，由于采用机械运输，就可把整个的大树装运下山了。
    长白山是我国著名的森林工业地区，每年要生产大量木材供应国家经济建设的需要。今年计划采伐的木材，比去年增加二十九万八千多立方公尺。今年上半年用机械采伐的木材已占采伐总量的27.2％。
