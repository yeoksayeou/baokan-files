Comrade Chairman: Dear comrades and friends!
    The Mongolian people, filled with joy and encouragement, celebrate their National Day – the 35th Anniversary of the People's Revolution – together with their close friends, the Chinese people, and all foreign friends.
    Thanks to the vigorous influence of the ideas of the Great October Revolution, and under the leadership of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party, the People's Revolution achieved victory in 1921. This enabled the Mongolian people to break free from the shackles of imperialism forever and to seize state power.
    From the very beginning of the victorious anti-imperialist and anti-feudal revolution, the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party and the People's Government have concentrated their activities on developing Mongolia along a non-capitalist path – a path leading to socialism in the future.
    In order to firmly implement its general line, the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party led the Mongolian people in the struggle to eliminate the political and economic foundations of feudalism, to eliminate the foreign usurious commercial capital in the national economy, and to develop the economy and culture.
    Under the leadership of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party, the Mongolian people eliminated the feudal landlord class and consolidated the decisive influence of state-owned and cooperative economic components in the development of the national economy of the Mongolian People's Republic.
    The victory of the anti-imperialist and anti-feudal revolution in Mongolia is a remarkable manifestation of the power of Marxist-Leninist thought, and a completely correct proof of the great Lenin's theory that a backward country can bypass the stage of capitalist development from feudalism and move towards socialism.
    The great victory of the national economy as a whole made it possible to enter into a long-term planned national economy in 1948.
    The first Five-Year Plan is a significant milestone in our country's advance along the socialist road.
    On the basis of completing the tasks of the first Five-Year Plan, the 12th Congress of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party adopted instructions on the second Five-Year Plan (1953-57) for the development of the national economy and culture of the Mongolian People's Republic.
    The country's development is now proceeding under the slogan "Strive for the successful implementation of the tasks of the second Five-Year Plan."
    As everyone knows, animal husbandry is the main sector of our national economy. During the years of the People's Government, the total number of livestock has increased two and a half times.
    Our national economy is developing on the basis of two forms – the socialist economy and the private economy of herdsmen. The socialist component of the national economy now plays a decisive role in the national life. In recent years, one of the forms of socialist components in agriculture – the pastoral production cooperative – has been developing at a particularly rapid pace. The number of such cooperatives has increased by 203% from the end of last year to the present. The number of members is increasing year by year, and the number of livestock within the cooperatives is constantly increasing.
    Veterinary work is playing an increasingly important role in the development of animal husbandry.
    Currently, every province has a veterinary station, and all counties have assistant veterinary stations. The various agents required for veterinary preventive measures are basically guaranteed by domestic products.
    Another form of socialist economy in agricultural economy – state-owned farms – is also developing rapidly. These farms provide examples of scientific management of business and large-scale mechanized operations for the animal husbandry economy. Plowing, sowing, and harvesting of grains have been completely mechanized in state-owned farms. In the past ten years, the total number of tractors has increased threefold, while the number of combine harvesters has increased eightfold.
    In order to help animal husbandry and agricultural cooperatives and to establish a solid feed base for animal husbandry, more than 70 horsepower mower stations have been established with the help of the Soviet Union. These mower stations are now equipped with agricultural machinery, which helps in cultivating crops, increasing livestock production, building livestock sheds, drilling wells, and other work.
    According to the Second Five-Year Plan for the development of the national economy and culture of the Mongolian People's Republic, a huge task of further developing the agricultural economy is stipulated. By the end of 1957, the total number of livestock will increase by 20% compared to 1953.
    With the development of animal husbandry, agriculture is also developing rapidly, so it is possible to greatly reduce the import of grain in the near future.
    A great achievement of the Mongolian people in the era of the People's Government is the establishment of a national industry with the fraternal assistance of the Soviet Union, and at the same time the working class has been formed.
    Now the Mongolian People's Republic has industrial enterprises for processing animal products – light industry and food industry, and at the same time, heavy industrial sectors such as mining, petroleum, and coal have also developed.
    In 1955, industrial output increased 3.6 times compared to 1940, and industrial investment in 1955 increased 5.5 times compared to 1942.
    The Party and government of the Mongolian People's Republic put forward the task of further developing the national industry.
    If pre-revolutionary Mongolia did not know the various forms of modern transportation, then they are now developing rapidly.
    The Sukhbaatar-Zamyn-Üüd railway runs through the north and south of our country, with a total length of 1,100 kilometers.
    This railway is of great significance in the development of our country's economy, and it greatly promotes the further consolidation of the friendship between the Mongolian People's Republic and its great neighbors – the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China. Therefore, the Mongolian people call this railway the "Road of Friendship."
    In the years of the People's Government, our country has completed a real cultural revolution. Now we have completely eliminated illiteracy among adult residents. There are currently 432 general schools, 16 secondary technical schools, 4 higher education institutions, and many night schools and training classes in the country. One in ten people is studying in these schools.
    With the continuous development of the national economy and culture, the material welfare of the working people of the Mongolian People's Republic has also increased year by year.
    In the years of the People's Government, particularly great achievements have been made in the cause of people's health. Our Party and government have taken many important measures to protect the health of the working people. Currently, there are nine hospital beds for every thousand residents, and one doctor for every two thousand three hundred people. The foundation of the national pharmaceutical industry has been established in the country.
    Thanks to the creativity and constructive labor of the Mongolian people, thanks to the wise leadership of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party, and thanks to the growing fraternal and selfless assistance of our loyal friend – the Soviet people, the Mongolian People's Republic has been able to achieve these achievements.
    The victory of the Soviet people in the Second World War against fascist Germany and imperialist Japan, the birth of the people's democratic countries in Eastern Europe, especially the establishment of the People's Republic of China in 1949, greatly consolidated the international position of the Mongolian People's Republic, and opened up new and broad scope for the faster development of our country.
    The founding of the People's Republic of China has opened a new era in the history of mutual relations between our two brotherly countries. Under the new historical conditions, the people of our two countries are developing sincere friendly relations, mutual respect, and equal relations.
    The Mongolian people are always delighted with the achievements made by the Chinese people in the cause of socialist construction under the leadership of their leader – the glorious Chinese Communist Party, and hope that they will achieve new victories.
    The fraternal friendship and cooperation between the Mongolian and Chinese peoples, the great achievements of the People's Republic of China in socialist construction and its increasing economic assistance to the Mongolian People's Republic, encourage our people to achieve new labor results in the development of the national economy.
    The Mongolian people are deeply convinced that without the active participation of the People's Republic of China, which has become an important factor in international development and progress, not only can the international problems of the Far East not be solved, but also the international problems of the whole world cannot be solved.
    There is no doubt that the People's Republic of China, as one of the world's great powers, has every right to become a member of the United Nations, and it will occupy its legitimate position in this international organization which has the mission of defending world peace and the security of all peoples. The Mongolian people believe that the day when the voice of the Chinese people is solemnly issued from the podium of the United Nations will not be far away; the Mongolian people also hope that the Chinese people will recover their ancient territory – Taiwan – by peaceful means.
    The Mongolian People's Republic is an independent and autonomous people's democratic country. We have established diplomatic relations with twelve countries that account for more than half of the world's population.
    The Mongolian people resolutely condemn colonialism and are full of sympathy for the people of Asian and African countries who are fighting for their freedom and national independence.
    The Mongolian people are well aware that the Cold War policy pursued by the ruling groups of certain Western countries is deliberately opposed to the will of all peoples who yearn for peace.
    The government of the Mongolian People's Republic pursues a peaceful foreign policy – a policy of peace and friendship between all peoples, warmly supports the Five Principles endorsed by the well-known Bandung Asian-African Conference, and develops and consolidates the friendship and cooperation of all countries friendly to our country on the basis of these principles.
    The Mongolian people, together with all the people who are fighting for peace, warmly support the peace-loving policies of the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China aimed at consolidating peace and friendship between all peoples.
    The peace-loving Mongolian people are closely united with all the people of the strong camp of democracy and socialism, and are struggling for peaceful coexistence of countries with different socio-economic systems, for mutual understanding and trust between them, and for further relaxation of international tension.
    Celebrate the 35th anniversary of the Mongolian People's Revolution!
    Long live the unbreakable fraternal friendship between the Mongolian and Chinese peoples!
    Long live world peace!

### 奥其尔巴特大使的讲话

1956-07-11

专栏：

    奥其尔巴特大使的讲话主席同志：亲爱的同志们和朋友们！
    蒙古人民满怀着欢乐和鼓舞的心情同自己的亲近朋友——中国人民以及所有的外国朋友们，在一起庆祝自己的国庆日——人民革命三十五周年。
    由于伟大十月革命思想蓬蓬勃勃的影响，在蒙古人民革命党的领导之下，人民革命于1921年获得胜利，这就使得蒙古人民永远摆脱了帝国主义的枷锁，并取得了国家的政权。
    从反帝国主义和反封建制度的革命胜利的最初时期起，蒙古人民革命党和人民政府就已把自己的活动集中于使蒙古循着非资本主义的道路——今后过渡到社会主义的道路——向前发展。
    为了坚定地实现自己的总路线，蒙古人民革命党领导蒙古人民进行了为消灭封建制度的政治经济基础，为排除全国经济中的外国重利盘剥的商业资本，以及为发展经济与文化的斗争。
    蒙古人民在蒙古人民革命党的领导之下，消灭了封建主这一个阶级，巩固了国营经济和合作社经济成份在蒙古人民共和国国民经济发展进程中所起的决定性的影响。
    反帝国主义与反封建主义的革命在蒙古的胜利，乃是马列主义思想力量的卓越表现，乃是伟大的列宁关于一个落后国家可以从封建制度越过资本主义发展阶段而走向社会主义的学说之完全正确的证明。
    全国国民经济的巨大胜利，使得在1948年有可能转入长期的计划国民经济。
    第一个五年计划是我国循着社会主义道路向前发展的一个显著的路标。
    在完成第一个五年计划的任务的基础上，蒙古人民革命党第十二次代表大会又通过了关于发展蒙古人民共和国国民经济和文化的第二个五年计划（1953—57年）的指示。
    现在国家的发展是在“为了顺利地实现第二个五年计划的任务而奋斗”这一口号之下进行的。
    大家都知道，畜牧业是我国国民经济中的主要部门。在人民政权的各年间牲畜总数增加到两倍半。
    我国国民经济是在两种形式——社会主义经济和牧民私有经济——的基础上发展的。现在国民经济中的社会主义成份在全国生活中起着决定性的作用。最近几年来，农业中社会主义成份形式之一——牧民生产合作社尤以飞跃的速度向前发展。仅仅从去年年底到现在，这种合作社的数量已增加了203％。社员人数逐年增长，社内牲畜头数不断增加。
    兽医工作在畜牧业的发展中越来越有着重大的作用。
    现在，每省都设有兽医站，所有的县都设有助理兽医站。兽医预防措施方面所需的各种药剂基本上都由国内产品保证供应。
    农业经济中另外一种社会主义经济形式——国营农场也以很快的速度向前发展。这些农场为畜牧经济作出了科学地管理业务的范例和大规模机械化经营的榜样。在国营农场中耕地、播种和收获谷物已全部机械化。最近十年来，拖拉机的总额增加到三倍，而联合收割机的数量则增加到八倍。
    为了帮助畜牧业和农业合作社并为了给畜牧业建立巩固的饲料基地，已在苏联的帮助下建立了七十多个马力割草机站。现在这些割草机站装备有农业机器，它们对耕种农作物、提高牲畜产量、建筑畜舍、钻井及其他工作都有帮助。
    按照蒙古人民共和国发展国民经济和文化的第二个五年计划，规定了进一步发展农业经济的巨大任务。到1957年年底，牲畜总数将比1953年增加20％。
    随着畜牧业的发展，农业也在迅速地发展着，因此有可能在最近时期内大大地减少粮食的进口。
    蒙古人民在人民政权年代里的巨大成绩，就是民族工业在苏联兄弟般的援助下建立起来了，同时工人阶级也形成了。
    现在蒙古人民共和国已拥有畜产原料加工的工业企业——轻工业和食品工业，同时，像采矿、石油、煤炭等这些重工业部门也有了发展。
    1955年工业产量比1940年增加到三点六倍，1955年工业投资比1942年增加到五点五倍。
    蒙古人民共和国党和政府提出了进一步发展民族工业的任务。
    如果革命前的蒙古不知道现代交通运输的种种方式的话，那末，到现在它们已在迅速地发展着。
    苏赫巴托—扎门乌德铁路干线纵贯我国南北，全长达一千一百公里。
    这条铁路在我国经济的发展方面有着巨大的意义，它大大地促进了蒙古人民共和国和它的伟大邻邦——苏联和中华人民共和国的友谊的进一步的巩固，因此，蒙古人民把这条铁路叫做“友谊的路”。
    在人民政权的年代里，我国完成了真正的文化革命。现在我们已经完全消灭了成年居民中的文盲。全国现有普通学校432所，中等技术学校十六所，高等学校四所，还有许多夜校和训练班，在每十个人中间就有一个人在这些学校里学习。
    随着国民经济和文化的不断发展，蒙古人民共和国劳动人民的物质福利也逐年有所提高。
    在人民政权的年代里，人民保健事业取得了特别巨大的成就。我们党和政府在保护劳动人民健康方面，采取了许多重大的措施。目前，在一千居民中就有九张病床，在二千三百人中间就有一个医生。国内已经建立了民族医药工业的基础。
    由于蒙古人民的创造性和建设性劳动，由于蒙古人民革命党的英明领导，由于我们忠诚的朋友——苏联人民的日益增长的兄弟般的、大公无私的援助，蒙古人民共和国才能够取得这些成就。
    苏联人民在反对法西斯德国和帝国主义日本的第二次世界大战中的胜利，东欧各人民民主国家的诞生，特别是1949年中华人民共和国的成立，大大地巩固了蒙古人民共和国的国际地位，为我国更快速的发展开辟了新的广阔的范围。
    中华人民共和国的成立，在我们两个兄弟国家相互关系的历史上开创了新纪元。在新的历史条件下我们两国人民发展着真诚的友好关系，互相尊敬和平等的关系。
    蒙古人民永远为中国人民在他们领导者——光荣的中国共产党领导之下，在社会主义建设事业中所取得的成就而欢欣，并希望他们取得新的胜利。
    蒙古人民和中国人民之间的兄弟般的友谊和合作，中华人民共和国在社会主义建设中的巨大成就和它对蒙古人民共和国日益增大的经济援助，鼓舞着我国人民在国民经济的发展中取得新的劳动成果。
    蒙古人民深信，没有已成为国际发展和进步之重要因素的中华人民共和国的积极参加，不但远东的国际问题无法解决，全世界的国际问题也无法解决。
    毫无疑义，作为世界大国之一的中华人民共和国有充分权利成为联合国的会员国，它将在这一个负有捍卫世界和平与各国人民安全的使命的国际机构中占有自己的合法地位。蒙古人民相信，从联合国讲台上庄严地发出人民中国的声音的这一天不久就会来临；蒙古人民并希望中国人民用和平方法收复他们自己的自古以来的领土——台湾。
    蒙古人民共和国是一个独立自主的人民民主国家。我们已经与占世界半数以上人口的十二个国家建立了外交关系。
    蒙古人民坚决谴责殖民主义，并对为自己的自由和民族独立而斗争的亚非各国人民满怀着同情。
    蒙古人民深知，某些西方国家统治集团所执行的冷战政策是蓄意反对渴望和平的各国人民的意志的。
    蒙古人民共和国政府执行爱好和平的外交政策——各国人民间和平友好的政策，热烈支持众所周知的万隆亚非会议所赞同的五项原则，并在这些原则的基础上发展和巩固所有与我国友好国家的人民的友谊和合作。
    蒙古人民与所有为争取和平而斗争的人民在一起，热烈支持苏联和中华人民共和国的爱好和平的、旨在巩固各国人民之间的和平与友谊的政策。
    爱好和平的蒙古人民同民主和社会主义强大阵营的所有人民紧密地团结一致，为争取不同社会经济制度国家的和平共处，为争取他们之间的相互了解和信任，为争取进一步缓和国际紧张局势而斗争。
    庆祝蒙古人民革命三十五周年！
    蒙中人民牢不可破的兄弟般的友谊万岁！
    世界和平万岁！
