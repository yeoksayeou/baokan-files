    Why Did the Pig Farming Contract Fall Through?
    In March of this year, the county food company sent people to our township and agricultural producers' cooperatives to sign contracts for assigning pig raising and purchasing. The whole township was assigned to raise 2,063 pigs and purchase 789 pigs. However, the actual number of pigs raised in the whole township has only reached 22% of the contracted number. It is estimated that by the end of the year, there will be 250 fattened pigs weighing more than 130 catties, which is only enough for the farmers themselves to eat in a township with more than 10,000 people.
    Why can't farmers raise pigs according to the contract? There are several reasons:
    First, when signing the contract, the staff of the food company made blind promises. They said that each sow would be supplied with 200 catties of rice, and each meat pig would be supplied with 50 catties of rice. In reality, apart from the rationed grain reserved in the "three fixings," no additional grain was supplied for feeding pigs. For example, the Minsheng Agricultural Cooperative raised nine times more pigs this year than last year, but the feed was still the same as the "three fixings," which was not enough at all. Our area is a cotton and hemp producing area, and it is difficult to raise more pigs without increasing feed. Farmers have a lot of opinions on this matter. Some said: "The food company is talking nonsense. If they don't give us feed, we won't sell the pigs at the end of the year, and the members will keep them for themselves."
    Second, the cost of piglets is too high. It costs about 20 yuan to buy a 14-15 catty piglet. After raising it for seven months, the best can grow to 150 catties, and the total cost is more than 50 yuan. However, the price of live pigs is only 32 yuan per 100 catties, and the pig manure can be sold for 10 yuan. In this way, farmers can't make much money, and those who don't raise them well will lose money, so farmers are unwilling to raise pigs.
    Third, there are many pig diseases, and the mortality rate of piglets is high. The food company has one clerk and five economic staff in our district, but no one knows how to treat pig diseases. The members shed tears when they see the piglets dying.
    We hope the government will help us solve these problems.

### 养猪合同为什么落空

    养猪合同为什么落空
    今年三月间，县食品公司派人到我们乡里和农业生产合作社订立了生猪派养派购的合同，全乡共派养猪2，063只、派购789只。可是现在全乡实际养猪数只达到合同数的22％，估计到年底可以养成130市斤以上的肥猪有250只，而全乡有一万多人口，那些猪只够农民自己吃的。
    为什么农民不能按合同养猪呢？有几个原因：
    一、订合同的时候，食品公司工作人员盲目许愿。他们说，每只母猪供应200斤稻谷，每只肉猪供应50斤稻谷。实际上除开“三定”中留的饲料粮以外，并没有另外供应喂猪的粮食。像民胜农业社今年养的猪比去年多九倍，饲料还是“三定”时留下那些，根本不够用。我们这里是产棉麻的地区，不增加饲料，要多喂猪是有困难的。农民对这件事很有意见，有的说：“食品公司说空话，他不给饲料，我们到年底不卖猪，留着社员自己吃。”
    二、小猪成本太高，买一只14—15斤的小猪要化20元左右，养七个月，最好的可长到150斤，成本一共要化50多元，而毛猪每百斤只卖32元，猪粪可卖10元。这样，农民赚不了多少钱，养得不好的还要亏本，农民就不愿养猪了。
    三、猪病多，小猪死亡率大。食品公司在我们区里有一个办事员、五个经济员，可是猪病了就没有一个人会医治，看见小猪死了社员直流眼泪。
    这些问题，希望政府帮助我们解决。
