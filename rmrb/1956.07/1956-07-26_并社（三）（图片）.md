    Merger of Cooperatives (3)
    Adapted by Tu Honghen, Illustrated by Jiang Ying
    (Adapted from Xu Guangyao's original work "Shu Ming and Yinghua")
    9　There are two cooperatives and one team in this Willow Tree Village. Since the implementation of the comprehensive planning, the decision to merge the two cooperatives into an advanced cooperative has made the young men and women of both cooperatives very happy. They are talking about the bright prospects in their happiness everywhere.
    10　That morning, Luo Shuming, the director of the First Cooperative, was leading a group of young men to plant apple trees on the sand ridge of the Second Cooperative. They were planting and singing at the same time. By noon, they had planted 1,800 trees, standing in rows and columns, filling the entire slope.
    11　Li Yinghua, a member of the Communist Youth League of the Second Cooperative, was also leading a group of girls to tidy up the club. They were also singing and cleaning, removing dirt, wiping windows, and arranging tables, preparing to welcome the young adults of the two cooperatives to attend the literacy school.
    12　The songs from the two places mingled and converged, spreading loudly to the early winter grassland. The songs also encouraged the people on the threshing floor to drive the horses to run around the field of bean stalks. … Willow Tree Village was immersed in the joy of labor.

    并社（三）
    屠鸿痕改编·江荧　画
    （据徐光耀原作“树明和莺花”改编）
    9　这柳树屯有两个社，还有一个组。自从一搞全面规划，决定两社合并成立高级社，两个社的男女青年们都乐开了，到处谈论着幸福中的远景。
    10　这天上午，一社主任罗树明带着一帮小伙子们，正在二社的沙岗上栽苹果树，一面栽一面唱，近晌午便栽完了一千八百棵，横看成行竖看成排地站满了一坡。
    11　二社青年团员李莺花也带着一伙闺女们在收拾俱乐部，她们也一面唱一面拾掇，清除脏土，擦玻璃，摆桌子，准备迎接两个社的青壮年来上民校。
    12　两处的歌声交溶汇合，响亮地向初冬的草原扩散着。歌声也带起打场的人们，把马赶得在满场的豆秸上转圈飞跑。………柳树屯沉醉在劳动的欢乐里。
