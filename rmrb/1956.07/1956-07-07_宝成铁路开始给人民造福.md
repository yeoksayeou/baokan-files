The Baoji-Chengdu Railway, after opening to traffic from Chengdu, Sichuan, to Yangping, Shaanxi, has greatly shortened the journey from Chengdu to Baoji. In the past, it took five or six days to travel from Chengdu to Baoji by car, but now it takes less than three days from Chengdu to Baoji. The landscape along the line is beginning to change. With the railway as the center, many short-distance highways extend to the railway line. Water transportation has also become busy with the partial opening of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway. In the past, boatmen on the Fu River in Mianyang had no goods to transport in the spring, but now ships carrying large quantities of coal and chemical fertilizers from Mianyang are busy traveling on the Fu River to Santai and Taizhen. Many towns along the railway line have prospered. Four years ago, Baolunyuan, the county seat of ?hua County, was just an ordinary small town, with cold and desolate streets. Passing travelers could not find hotels or food. Since the train came here, the population of Baolunyuan has more than doubled, becoming a distribution center for local specialties and daily necessities in the Jianmen Mountain area, covering dozens of kilometers.

After the partial opening of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway, many cheap daily necessities and local specialties were transported to the farmers. In less than five months since the train reached Lueyang, people could buy Chengdu fruit candies and the famous pickled mustard tuber from Fuling County, Sichuan. Comrades from the Lueyang Trading Company said, "In the past, due to high transportation costs, it was difficult to sell non-staple foods from Sichuan, but now the supply often falls short of demand."

The partial opening of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway has also promoted the development of handicrafts in towns along the line. Before the opening of the railway, the Guangyuan Bamboo and Rattan Production Cooperative had to go to Wangchang County, more than 100 miles away, to buy bamboo. The price of bamboo was only 1.5 fen per catty, but the transportation cost was 2.8 fen. After the partial opening of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway, large quantities of cheap bamboo were transported from Mianyang, Zhongba, and other places to the Guangyuan Bamboo and Rattan Production Cooperative. The price of rattan products has decreased, and sales have improved.

The partial opening of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway has demonstrated such a great role and brought happiness to the people. When the entire line is open to traffic in the near future, it will bring even more happiness to the people. (Attached picture)

Train Ascends to the Clouds—Schematic Diagram of the Qinling Engineering of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway

Explanation of the Diagram
The Qinling Mountains are very steep on the north-western side and descend slowly on the southern side.
The Baoji-Chengdu Railway is laid southwards from Baoji. After passing Yangjiawan Station, it ascends the mountain at a large gradient. The aerial distance from Yangjiawan Station to the top of the Qinling Mountains is only six kilometers, but the difference in altitude between the two places is 680 meters. If the line did not spiral, it would have to rise more than 100 meters per kilometer. Such a steep gradient would be impossible for the train to climb. In order to change the gradient to 30 meters per kilometer, suitable for train passage, the line has to repeatedly spiral upwards, winding 27 kilometers within a six-kilometer aerial distance. In this way, the line forms a five-layer overlapping pattern, shaped like the number "8".

At the main peak of the Qinling Mountains, the line passes through the 2.5-kilometer-long Qinling Tunnel and then winds its way to Fengzhou.

    宝成铁路开始给人民造福
    子平　马华
    宝成铁路从四川成都通车到陕西阳平后，已大大缩短了从成都到宝鸡的路程。过去，从成都到宝鸡，坐汽车要五、六天的时间，现在不到三天就能从成都到宝鸡了。沿线的面貌开始改变了。以铁路为中枢，很多短途公路伸延到铁路沿线来。水上运输也随着宝成路的局部通车而繁忙起来了。过去绵阳涪江上的船民，一到春天就无货可运，现在从绵阳载着大批煤和化学肥料的船只，正忙碌地在通往三台、太镇去的涪江河上往来。铁路沿线的很多城镇繁荣起来。四年前，?化县城宝轮院，还是一个普通的小镇，街上冷冷清清的，过路旅客在这里找不到旅店住，买不到东西吃。自从火车通到这里以后，宝轮院的人口比过去增加了两倍，成为剑门山区纵横几十公里的土特产品和日用百货的集散地了。
    宝成路局部通车后，给农民们运来了很多便宜的日用百货和土特产品。火车通车到略阳还不到五个月的时间，人们就可买到成都的水果糖和四川涪陵县有名的柞菜。略阳贸易公司的同志们说：“过去由于运费高，从四川运来的副食品不好销售，现在却经常不够供应。”
    宝成路的局部通车，也促进了沿线城镇手工业的发展。在没有通车以前，广元竹藤生产合作社，要到离一百多里的旺昌县去买竹子，每斤竹子的价钱只一分半，运费却要二点八分。宝成路局部通车后，从绵阳、中坝等地给广元竹藤生产合作社运来了大批便宜的竹子，藤制品的价格降低了，销路也好了。
    宝成路局部通车后，显示了这样巨大的作用，为人民带来了幸福；不久全线通车以后，将给人们带来更多的幸福。（附图片）
    火车上云霄——宝成铁路秦岭工程示意图
    崔敏制图 
    本图说明
    秦岭，北西很陡，南面缓缓下降。
    宝成铁路从宝鸡向南铺下来，过了杨家湾车站，就以很大的坡度上山。从杨家湾车站到秦岭峰顶，航空距离只有六公里，可是两地高低却差六百八十公尺。如果线路不盘道而行，那么每公里就要升高一百多公尺。这样陡的坡度，火车是无论如何也爬不上去的。为了把坡度改成每公里升高三十公尺，适于火车通行，线路只好反复盘旋着往上爬，在六公里的航空距离内盘绕二十七公里。这样，线路就形成五层重叠之势，“8”字之状。
    在秦岭主峰，线路穿过二点五公里长的秦岭大隧道后，蜿蜒通向凤州。
