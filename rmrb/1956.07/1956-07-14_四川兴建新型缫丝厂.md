Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, 13th: Construction of the state-owned Mianyang Silk Reeling Factory in Sichuan Province began on the 11th. This is the first of many new-type mechanized silk reeling factories to be built in our country.

　　Mianyang Prefecture in Sichuan Province is one of the major silkworm cocoon producing areas in our country. Once the Mianyang Silk Reeling Factory is built, the local silkworm cocoons will no longer need to be transported to other places for processing.

　　After the factory is completed, in addition to producing large quantities of high-grade raw silk that sells well at home and abroad, the factory is also designed with a pupa oil leaching workshop, which can make extensive use of waste cocoons from production to refine industrial oil.

　　It is expected that this factory will be put into production by the end of this year.

    四川兴建新型缫丝厂
    据新华社成都13日电　四川省国营绵阳缫丝厂，十一日动工兴建。这是我国将要兴建的许多个新型机械化缫丝厂中的第一个。
    四川省绵阳专区是我国盛产蚕茧的地区之一。绵阳缫丝厂建设起来以后，当地的蚕茧就可以不用运往外地加工了。
    这个工厂建成以后，除了大量生产国内外畅销的高品位生丝以外，工厂还设计有蛹油浸出车间，可以大量利用生产以后的废茧提炼工业用油。
    预计这个厂在今年年底就可以投入生产。
