Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 14th. The longest high-voltage power line in the Northwest - the Xi'an to Tongchuan high-voltage power line erection project, began construction on July 11th. This high-voltage line is a total of 100 kilometers long, and its voltage is twice as high as the existing high-voltage lines in the Northwest. The entire project will be completed in the first quarter of next year.

This high-voltage power line project adopts segmented reinforced concrete poles and prefabricated construction methods, which can save four-fifths of steel, reduce labor by half, and increase construction efficiency by one time compared to using iron tower wiring. Now, construction workers are working hard in the turbulent Wei River, overcoming the difficulties of deep sand layers at the bottom of the river and a lack of construction experience, and are speeding up piling to ensure a solid pole foundation is built before the rainy season. Substation construction in Xi'an and Tongchuan is also underway.

After the two newly built and renovated mine pairs in the Tongchuan mining area are officially put into production this year, a batch of mines will continue to be built. The power consumption will greatly increase, and the existing power generation capacity of the Tongchuan Power Plant cannot meet the needs of coal production development. After this high-voltage power line is erected, the Tongchuan mining area will be able to obtain four times more power than it currently does.

    西安铜川间高压电线工程开工
    新华社西安14日电　西北最长的一条高压线——西安至铜川间高压电线的架线工程，七月十一日开始动工。这条高压线共长一百公里，电压比西北现有高压线的电压高两倍。全部工程将在明年第一季度完工。
    这条高压线工程采用钢筋混凝土分段式电杆和装配式施工方法，这比采用铁塔架线能节约五分之四的钢材，人工能减少一半，施工效率可以提高一倍。现在建筑工人们正在渭河激流当中，克服河底沙层深和缺乏施工经验的困难，加紧打桩，保证在雨季做好牢固的电杆基础。西安和铜川两地的变电站也正在紧张施工。
    铜川矿区新建和改建的两对矿井，今年内正式投入生产以后，还将继续增建一批矿井，用电量将大大增加，而铜川电厂现有发电能力不能适应煤炭生产发展的需要。这条高压线架成以后，铜川矿区就可以得到比现在大四倍的电力。
