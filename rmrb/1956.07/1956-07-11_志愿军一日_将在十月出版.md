    “A Day of the Volunteer Army” to Be Published in October

    This newspaper reports that "A Day of the Volunteer Army," a military documentary literary work comprehensively reflecting the history of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army's fight against U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, has now been compiled and is ready for printing. It will be published in October this year.

    This literary masterpiece of more than one million words was written entirely by soldiers, commanders at all levels, political workers, and rear service personnel of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. Among them are General Yang Dezhi, Deputy Commander of the Volunteer Army, General Qin Jiwei, one of the commanders of the famous Battle of Shangganling, and many famous combat heroes. From various different angles, they recounted the arduous and heroic struggle and great victory of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army on the Korean battlefield, reflecting the high degree of patriotism, internationalism, and revolutionary heroism of the Volunteer Army commanders and soldiers.

    The content of this book is extremely rich. It includes the specific circumstances of all the important battles and famous engagements fought by the Volunteer Army in Korea, the combat deeds of various services and arms on the front and rear lines, the wartime life and ideological sentiments of senior commanders and ordinary soldiers, the combat stories of many famous heroic figures, the combat friendship between our army and the Korean people, the inhuman atrocities committed by the U.S. imperialist invading army in Korea, and their shameful defeats... all of which are faithfully recorded in the book.

    The book compiles a total of more than five hundred and sixty short stories, and the entire book is divided into four parts in chronological order according to the time when the events written in each work occurred.

    The work of collecting manuscripts for this book began as early as the first winter after the Korean armistice. The Chinese People's Volunteer Army launched a large-scale mass writing campaign of "A Day of the Volunteer Army" throughout the army. All commanders and fighters of the Volunteer Army responded enthusiastically to this call. The works selected for this book were all carefully selected from 100,000 solicited manuscripts.
