Investigation of Income Situation of Commune Members in Pingshun County
Wei Ziying

All 29,556 peasant households in Pingshun County, Shanxi Province, have joined advanced cooperatives. They all hope that in the first year of realizing complete socialist cooperation, their actual income can increase compared to the previous year. However, they have no experience with the completely "distribution according to work" method, and they are completely unsure whether their income this year will increase or decrease. Commune members of the "People" Agricultural Cooperative in Shuchan Village reflect three concerns: first, they worry that the cooperative's plan will not be completed; second, they worry that the cooperative's expenses are a bottomless pit; and third, they worry that their income is not guaranteed. In particular, some commune members who used to have more land, higher yields, and special income from Sichuan pepper and orchards are even more worried. They say, "The distribution according to work method is good, but we are anxious without knowing the bottom line." Commune members of the "Minsheng" Agricultural Cooperative in Zhongwujing Township say, "The cooperative spends more and earns less, the hole is big, the patch is small, and we don't know how much we will get after discounts in the autumn."

How Many Commune Members Can Actually Increase Their Income?

How many commune members can actually increase their income? The county party committee was also unclear. In order to understand the distribution situation of agricultural cooperatives throughout the county this year, the county party committee organized three working groups on May 8th to conduct investigations in three cooperatives in different areas: food crop areas, cash crop areas, and poor mountainous areas. After estimating production and budgeting income and expenditure, they calculated the actual income ratio of commune members. The total deductions of the three cooperatives accounted for 24.05% of the total income, and the remaining 75.95% could be distributed to commune members. Among the 504 households in the three cooperatives, the actual income of 88.8% of the commune members exceeded that of previous years, while the actual income of 11.2% of the commune members remained the same or slightly decreased.

In order to further understand the situation, the county party committee also convened nine cooperatives, including the "Construction" cooperative in Shenjiaping, for a forum and investigation. The results were: the total income from agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and sideline production of the nine cooperatives was 636,965 yuan, the investment in agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and sideline production of the nine cooperatives accounted for 14.8% of the total income, administrative management fees accounted for 0.52%, agricultural taxes to be paid accounted for 4.47%, public accumulation funds accounted for 5.98%, and public welfare funds accounted for 1.43%. The total of the five deductions accounted for 27.2% of the total income, and the remaining 72.8% of the income could be fully distributed to commune members. According to the principle of "distribution according to work, more work, more gain", the results of the trial distribution showed that the actual income of 89.83% of the commune members exceeded that of previous years, 3.94% remained the same, and 6.23% had actual income lower than last year. The total number of households with no increase or decrease and reduced income accounted for 10.17% of the total number of commune members. Among these households were township cadres, supply and marketing cooperative cadres, credit cooperative cadres, and those who went out to work as laborers. Although the income of these households in the cooperative decreased, their income from other sources increased, so they should not be counted as households with reduced income. Thus, the actual number of households with reduced income and those with the same income as in the past accounted for only 8.2% of the total number of households.

In early June, the county party committee also convened a county-wide cooperative accounting meeting to review the four plans for production, labor, capital construction, and finance, as well as the annual income and expenditure distribution plan, and conducted a comprehensive investigation. The total income from agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production of the 180 cooperatives in the county was 7,463,095 yuan, investment in various production activities accounted for 14.5% of the total income, administrative management fees accounted for 0.51%, agricultural and forestry taxes accounted for 4.65%, public accumulation funds accounted for 6.17%, and public welfare funds accounted for 1.59%. The total expenditure accounted for 27.42% of the total income. The actual distribution to commune members accounted for 72.58% of the total income.

From the perspective of each cooperative: the actual income distributed to commune members accounted for more than 80% of the total income in 13 cooperatives, 75% to 80% in 44 cooperatives, and the least accounted for 60% of the total income. The 180 cooperatives used a total of 7,451,042 labor days for agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, capital construction, and cooperative affairs throughout the year, of which agricultural and forestry capital construction labor days accounted for 13.8% of the total labor days. These labor days without immediate benefits were equally distributed as obligatory labor according to labor power. The actual labor days participating in the distribution accounted for 86.2% of the total labor days, and each labor day could be distributed about 0.843 yuan, an increase of 60.6% compared to last year. From the perspective of each cooperative, 29 cooperatives distributed more than one yuan per labor day, 141 cooperatives distributed between 0.5 and 1 yuan per labor day, and 10 cooperatives distributed less than 0.5 yuan per labor day. According to this distribution result, among the commune members of the 180 cooperatives, the income of 78.3% of the total number of commune members exceeded that of previous years, 15.3% of the total number of commune members remained the same, and 6.4% of the total number of commune members had income reduced to varying degrees.

Who are the Households with Reduced Income?

Who are these households with reduced income? According to the analysis of 208 commune members with reduced income in the nine cooperatives, there are the following types: 59 households belonged to widowers, widows, orphans, and the disabled who lost their labor force, accounting for 2.42% of the total number of commune members; 63 households had more land, higher yields, and special income from Sichuan pepper orchards in the past, accounting for 2.5%; 10 households reduced investment this year, resulting in reduced income, accounting for 0.45%; 18 households reduced labor force due to going to school or death, accounting for 0.73%; 29 households were families of revolutionary soldiers and officers who implemented salary system reductions and exemptions for labor days in lieu of cultivation, accounting for 1.19%; 19 households had main laborers suffering from chronic diseases and unable to participate in labor, accounting for 0.77%; 7 households had main laborers suffering from short-term illnesses, reducing labor days, accounting for 0.24%; 3 households had reduced income due to poor and lazy labor, accounting for 0.12% of the total number of commune members.

Through this comprehensive investigation from point to area, the cadres' minds were clarified. They believed that although preliminary calculations showed that more than 90% of the commune members could increase their income, how to strive for more commune members to increase their income more is a problem that should be focused on in the current production leadership.

From Which Aspects to Solve the Problem?

The more common problems existing in agricultural production cooperatives throughout the county are: attaching importance to agriculture while neglecting the development of diversified economies. According to the statistics of 180 cooperatives, other income besides agriculture accounted for only 18.3% of the total income, and some cooperatives accounted for less than 10%. Some cooperatives only plan for diversified economies in words and on paper, lacking specific organization and arrangements. For example, the two large rubber-wheeled carts of Xinhua First Cooperative in Beishe Township have been sleeping for months. According to this situation, each cooperative has revised its plan for developing diversified economies on the basis of the established plan, overcoming the idea of seeing the big and not the small, clarifying the boundaries between the cooperative and the individual management of commune members, organizing labor, stipulating reasonable remuneration for conducting diversified production, and actively developing diversified production. In addition, in order to strengthen leadership, the county has determined that a deputy county head, a township deputy head, and a cooperative deputy director will specialize in leadership.

Continue to implement the policy of "running the cooperative diligently and thriftily" and further compress non-productive expenditures. For example, the non-productive expenditure of the "People" Cooperative in Heyu Township was compressed from the original plan of 570 yuan to 160 yuan. For the phenomenon of large investment and excessive man-days in cooperative caused by the transmission of orders from higher-level leading organs, the leading departments should control it in a planned way.

According to the understanding of nine cooperatives, 2.58% of the commune members had different degrees of reduction in actual income due to improper handling of the means of production. In order to make these commune members change from more reduction to less reduction, appropriate policies are adopted. For the 72 cooperatives in the county with special products such as Sichuan pepper and orchards, except for individual cooperatives such as Yangjingdi, which adopted the method of valuation as investment in the cooperative, other cooperatives adopted the method of unified management by the cooperative, grading and distributing according to proportions, correcting the "sweeping away" method of some cooperatives. The erroneous practice of putting production trees in front of the house into the cooperative was also corrected. It is clearly stipulated that production trees in front of and behind the houses should not be included in the cooperative.

    平顺县关于社员收入情况的调查
    魏子英
    山西省平顺县29，556户农民，全部加入了高级社。他们都盼望在实现完全社会主义合作化的头一年，自己的实际收入能够比前一年有所增加。但是，完全“按劳取酬”的分配办法都还没有经验过，自己今年的收入是增是减？完全不摸底。束禅村“人民”农业社社员反映有三担心：一担心社内计划完不成；二担心社内开支是没底坑；三担心自己的收入没保证。特别是一些过去土地多、产量大、有花椒和果园等特殊收入的社员更担心。他们说：“按劳取酬办法好，不摸底子心里焦”。中五井乡“民胜”农业社社员说：“合作社出的多、进的少，窟窿大、补钉小，秋后七折八扣不知分多少”。
    到底有多少社员能增加收入
    究竟能有多少社员增加收入？县委也不清楚。为了摸清全县农业社今年分配底子，县委会于五月八日组织了三个工作组，分头到粮食作物区、经济作物区和贫瘠山区三种不同地区的三个合作社进行调查，经过估产、预算收支情况，再算出社员的实际收入比例。三个社各项扣除共占总收入24.05％，其余75.95％可以分配给社员。三社504户社员，有88.8％社员的实际收入超过往年，有11.2％社员的实际收入不增不减或稍减。
    为了进一步摸清情况，县委又召集了申家坪“建设”等九个合作社进行座谈调查摸底。结果是：九个社全年农、林、牧、副业总收入636，965元，九个社全年农、林、牧、副业生产投资占总收入的14.8％，行政管理费占0.52％，需要交纳的农业税收等占4.47％，公积金占5.98％，公益金占1.43％。五项扣除共占总收入的27.2％，其余72.8％的收入可以全部分配给社员。按照“按劳取酬，多劳多得”原则试算分配的结果，实际收入超过往年的占社员总户数的89.83％，不增不减的占3.94％，实际收入不及去年的占6.23％。不增不减和减少收入两者合计占社员总户数10.17％。这些户中有乡干部，供销社、信用社干部，有外出当工人的。这类户在合作社里的收入虽减少，但另一面的收入却增加了，不该算减少收入户。这样实际减少收入户以及收入和过去相等户只占总户数8.2％。
    六月初，县委又召开了全县合作社会计会议，审查了生产、劳动、基本建设、财务等四个规划和全年收支分配计划，又进行了全面的摸底。全县180个合作社，全年农、林、牧畜、副业总收入为7，463，095元，各项生产投资占总收入14.5％，行政管理费占0.51％，全年农林等税收占4.65％，公积金占6.17％，公益金占1.59％。开支合计共占总收入27.42％。社员实际分配占总收入的72.58％。
    从各个社看：实际收入分配给社员占总收入80％以上的13个社，占75％至80％的44个社，最少的占总收入60％。180个合作社，全年农、林、牧、副业和基本建设、社务等共用劳动日7，451，042个，其中农林基本建设劳动日占总劳动日的13.8％。对这些当年没有收益的劳动日按劳力平摊义务工，实际参加分配的劳动日占劳动日总数的86.2％，每个劳动日约可分得款0.843元，比去年提高60.6％。从各社看，每个劳动日分一元以上的29个社，分一元以下五角以上的141个社，每个劳动日分五角以下的10个社。这样分配结果，180个社的社员中，收入超过往年的占社员总户数的78.3％，不增不减的占总户数的15.3％，收入有不同程度减少的占总户数的6.4％。
    减少收入的都是哪些户
    这些减少收入的都是哪些户呢？根据九个社减少收入的208户社员的分析有如下几种：属于鳏、寡、孤、独丧失劳动力的59户，占社员总户数2.42％；过去土地多，产量大和有花椒果园等特殊收入的63户，占2.5％；去年投资多，今年减少投资而降低收入的10户，占0.45％；因外出住学校、死亡等原因减少劳力的18户，占0.73％；革命军人家属，军官实行薪金制减免代耕劳动日的29户，占1.19％；家庭主要劳动力终年疾病不能参加劳动的19户，占0.77％；因家庭主要劳动力短期生病减少劳动日的7户，占0.24％；因劳动不好懒惰减少收入的3户，占社员总户数的0.12％。
    通过这次由点到面的普遍摸底，清醒了干部头脑，他们认为虽然初步计算90％以上社员都能增加收入，但是，怎样争取更多的社员，更多的增加收入，是当前生产领导上应该集中注意的问题。
    从哪些方面解决问题
    全县农业生产合作社存在的较普遍的问题是：重视农业忽视发展多种经济。据180个合作社的统计，农业以外的其他收入，仅占总收入的18.3％，有的社还占不到10％。有些合作社对多种经济只是规划在嘴上，写在纸上，缺乏具体的组织和安排。如北社乡新华第一社两辆大胶轮车几个月来一直睡大觉。根据这个情况，各个社都在已订计划的基础上，修订了发展多种经济的计划，克服看大不看小的思想，划清合作社与社员个人经营的界限，组织劳力，规定进行多种生产的合理报酬，积极开展多种生产。另外，为加强领导，并确定县由一个副县长，乡由一个副乡长，合作社由一个副主任专门领导。
    继续贯彻执行“勤俭办社”的方针，进一步压缩非生产性的开支。如和峪乡“人民”社非生产性的开支由原计划的570元压缩到160元。对属于上级领导机关条条下达造成合作社投资大误工多的现象，由领导部门有计划地加以控制。
    根据九个合作社的了解，有2.58％的社员是因为处理生产资料不妥当，致实际收入有不同程度的减少。为了使这些社员由多减变为少减，采取适当的政策。对全县有花椒、果园等特产的72个社，除羊井底等个别社采取作价入社外，其它社采取由合作社统一经营、分等分级按比例分配，纠正有些社“一扫光”的办法。房前家院生产树入社的错误做法，也进行了纠正。明确规定房前屋后的生产树不入社。
