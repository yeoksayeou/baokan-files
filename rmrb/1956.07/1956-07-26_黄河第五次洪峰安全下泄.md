    Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, July 25th. The Yellow River's fifth flood peak reached Qinchang at 4:00 AM today, with the flow rate increasing from 2860 cubic meters per second at 8:00 AM yesterday to 6350 cubic meters per second. However, this flood peak did not last long. By 8:00 AM, the flow rate at Qinchang had decreased to 5700 cubic meters per second. It is expected that by the 28th, this flood peak will safely flow into the sea, just like the previous four flood peaks.
    From the 21st to the 23rd, cold and warm air masses met in the air over the area east of Lanzhou, causing widespread rainfall in the upper reaches of the Yellow River tributaries Jing River, Wuding River, Yan River, and the border areas of Shanxi and Shaanxi provinces. Qingyang County in Gansu Province, and Wuqi and Yichuan counties in Shaanxi Province experienced rainfall of 60 to 70 millimeters. The rainfall was characterized by high intensity and short duration. Therefore, the main stream and tributaries of the Yellow River in this area experienced flash floods with rapid rises and falls, but the total water volume was not large. The water levels of the Malian River, a tributary of the Jing River, in Qingyang, and the Yan River in Gangu Station both exceeded the highest recorded water levels. These floods converged to form the fifth flood peak in the Yellow River below Tongguan since the flood season began this year.

    黄河第五次洪峰安全下泄
    新华社郑州25日电　黄河第五次洪峰今天四时到达秦厂，流量由昨日八时的二八六零秒公方上涨到六三五零秒公方。但是，这次洪峰持续的时间不久，到八时，秦厂的流量就下降到五七零零秒公方。预计到二十八日，这次洪峰仍可以像前四次洪峰一样地安全入海。
    二十一日到二十三日，冷气团和暖气团在兰州以东地区的空中接触，引起黄河支流泾河、无定河、延水上游以及山西和陕西两省交界地区普遍降雨。甘肃省庆阳县、陕西省吴旗、宜川等县降雨六零到七零公厘，降雨的特点是强度大，历时短。因此，这个地区的黄河干流和支流都发生陡涨急落、总水量不大的洪水。泾河支流马连河在庆阳的水位和延水在甘谷驿的水位，都超过了有纪录以来的最高水位。这些洪水汇合成今年入汛以来黄河在潼关以下的第五次洪峰。
