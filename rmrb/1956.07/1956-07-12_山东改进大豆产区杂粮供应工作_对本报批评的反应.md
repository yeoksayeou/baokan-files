Letter from the Shandong Provincial Grain Bureau: After reading the article "Why Not Supply Coarse Grains to Farmers Who Grow Soybeans" published in the People's Daily on May 10th, we conducted an inspection and study of the coarse grain distribution work in our province's concentrated soybean producing areas.

Our province's grain production is unbalanced in terms of varieties. For example, in the Jining, Liaocheng, and Huimin special districts along the Yellow River and Weishan Lake in our province, more soybeans are grown. After the unified purchase and sale of grain, the state is responsible for supplying grain to people lacking food. Because our province's coarse grain production is insufficient, we cannot fully meet the needs of the masses.

In recent years, we have made the greatest efforts in grain seed distribution in concentrated soybean producing areas. In 1955, the Jining Special District sold 100.832 million jin of coarse grains to rural areas. In March of this year, we allocated another 10 million jin of coarse grains to the Jining Special District. In total, 10 million jin can generally solve the problem. However, because some grassroots units were too strict in controlling grain seed exchange and had complicated procedures (e.g., exchanging soybeans for coarse grains required approval from the township after review by the district), the grain seed exchange of the masses was inappropriately restricted, resulting in a large portion of the distributed exchange grain not being exchanged. We were only satisfied with the allocation of quotas and did not pay enough attention to solving the actual difficulties of the masses. This is something we should examine. Currently, we have urged various localities to improve supply methods, quickly distribute the allocated exchange quotas to villages, simplify procedures, and allow farmers who produce soybeans to exchange for the coarse grains they need.

### 山东改进大豆产区杂粮供应工作——对本报批评的反应

    山东改进大豆产区杂粮供应工作
    ——对本报批评的反应
    山东省粮食厅来信：读了五月十日人民日报发表的“为什么不给种大豆的农民供应杂粮”一文后，我们就对我省大豆集中产区的杂粮调剂工作进行了检查和研究。
    我省的粮食生产，在品种上是不平衡的，如我省沿黄河和微山湖一带的济宁、聊城、惠民等几个专区，种植大豆较多，粮食统购统销后，缺粮人民的粮食供应由国家负责，由于我省杂粮生产不足，因之不能完全满足群众的需要。
    几年来，我们在大豆集中产区的粮种调剂上曾经尽了最大的努力。1955年济宁专区销于农村的杂粮一亿零八百三十二万斤，今年三月份我们又拨出杂粮一千万斤给了济宁专区。按总数说，一千万斤大体上可以解决问题。但是，由于有些基层单位在粮种的兑换上掌握偏严，手续繁多（如以大豆兑换杂粮必须经乡审查报区批准），不适当地限制了群众的粮种兑换，因而使分配该区的兑换粮食还有一大部分未兑换出去。我们只满足于指标的分配，对群众的实际困难的解决，没有给以足够的重视，这是我们应作检讨的。目前我们已督促各地改进供应方法，迅速把已分配的兑换指标放到乡村，简化手续，让生产大豆的农民能够换到需要的杂粮。
