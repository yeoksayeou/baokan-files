Why are these science enthusiasts disappointed?
    Chun Xu
    Currently, people are talking about atomic energy, radio, and semiconductors, and the atmosphere is filled with a drive towards science. More and more people are reading science books and periodicals, discussing scientific principles, and engaging in practical experiments. Some students, teachers, and government employees want to learn practical knowledge of radio; some want to assemble a crystal radio by themselves; some want to assemble a simple vacuum tube radio; some want to make a toy motor. Some young students want to buy a set of woodworking tools: saws, axes, planes, etc., to learn how to make various tools and become a small worker. Their enthusiasm for learning should be valued and supported by all parties.
    To meet the needs of these science enthusiasts, it is absolutely necessary to produce and sell some radio parts, hand tools, and other equipment. However, most customers currently cannot buy the experimental equipment they need. One day in early May, a customer took the second issue of "Knowledge is Power" magazine to the Donghuamen outlet of the state-owned China Transportation Electrical Equipment Company, wanting to install a travel radio following the circuit introduced in the magazine; however, this customer could not buy the materials to make this radio. A similar thing happened at the Xidan Silians Radio Store. Not only that, but surprisingly, even the simplest crystal radio parts are not available on the market. As for some students, teachers, government employees, and suburban farmers who want to buy an assembled three-circuit crystal radio, it is even more difficult. Because this type of crystal radio only has a sample in the Silians Radio Store in Xidan District, which can only be viewed, not bought.
    Many children cannot buy small saws, small axes, and small planes, and their desire to be "little workers" and "little architects" cannot be realized.
    From these practical examples, it can be seen that the work of commercial departments is lagging behind the new situation and the needs of the people. The main reason is that commercial workers have not improved their business accordingly based on changes in people's needs. Under the current circumstances, it is obviously not enough for commercial departments to only do a good job in managing major commodities such as grain, cloth, oil, and sugar, as well as general daily necessities. Because new factors have been added to people's lives, more extensive and more complex new demands will inevitably be placed on commercial departments, and the demands in this area are constantly developing. Commercial departments should immediately begin systematic research and analysis on this issue, take specific measures, expand the scope of commodity supply, and maximize the satisfaction of the new demands of the people.

    这些科学爱好者为什么失望
    春旭
    现在，人们都在谈论原子能、无线电和半导体，到处都充满向科学进军的空气。看科学书刊、谈科学道理和动手实际试验的人越来越多了。有些学生、教员和机关干部想学习无线电的实际知识；有的想自己动手装制一架矿石收音机；有的想装制一架简单的真空管收音机；有的想做一架玩具电动机。有些青年学生想买一套木工用具：锯子、斧子、刨子等，学习制造各种用具，想当一个小工人。他们这种学习热情是应当受到各方面的重视和支持的。
    为了满足这些科学爱好者的需要，生产和销售一些收音机零件、手工工具和其它器材，是完全必要的。但是，大部分顾客目前都买不到自己需要的试验器材。五月上旬的一天，一个顾客带着第二期“知识就是力量”杂志到东华门国营中国交通电工器材公司门市部，想仿照杂志上介绍的线路，安装一架旅行收音机；但是这位顾客买不到装制这部收音机的材料。在西单四联无线电行也发生类似的事情。不仅如此，使人出乎意料的是：市场上连最简单的矿石收音机的零件也买不到。至于有些学生、教员、机关干部和郊区农民想买一架装好的三回路矿石收音机，那就更加困难了。因为这种型式的矿石收音机仅仅在西单区四联无线电行有一架样品，只能看，不能买。
    许多小朋友买不到小锯、小斧和小刨，想当“小工人”“小建筑师”的愿望也实现不了。
    从这些实际例子可以看出，商业部门的工作是落在新的形势和人民需要的后面了。主要原因是商业工作人员没有根据人民需要的变化来相应地改进自己的业务。在目前情况下，商业部门仅仅做好粮、布、油、糖等主要商品及一般日用品的经营工作显然是不够的，因为人们生活中增加了新的因素，就必然给商业部门提出更加广泛、更加复杂的新要求，而且这方面的要求还在不断地发展着。商业部门应该对这方面的问题立即着手进行系统的研究和分析，采取具体措施，扩大商品供应范围，最大限度地满足人民群众的新要求。
