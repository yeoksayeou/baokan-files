Column: Party Member Letter

    Editor's Note: The inactivity of the organizational life of many Party branches restricts the enthusiasm and creativity of Party members. Therefore, many Party members demand a swift change to this situation. This demand is correct and should be supported.
    But to change this situation, we must first understand where the obstacles lie. The following two letters from Party members raise issues regarding their branch life. We hope everyone can expose the state of inactivity and the reasons for it in Party organizational life from more perspectives, and propose ways to improve it, so that the life of Party organizations can quickly become active.
    No Praise for the Good, No Criticism for the Bad
    To the Editor:
    I have been working at the Beijing China Native Produce Export Corporation for over a year. Soon after arriving at the company, I felt that the organizational life of the Party here was very inactive. In the second half of last year, apart from holding one or two branch meetings to discuss the issue of counter-revolutionaries, the Party branch hardly had any activities. At the beginning of this year, many Party members raised many opinions about the dullness of the Party's organizational life. Since then, although there have been more Party organizational activities than before, at the Party member meetings and group meetings, it has only been about conveying instructions from the higher Party committee, summarizing branch work, discussing the formal membership of probationary members, and disciplinary actions against individual Party members. These issues should be discussed, but only discussing these issues without touching on the issues in everyone's work, study, life, and ideological style, makes it difficult to activate the Party's organizational life. Is it that the Party members of this branch have no problems in their ideology, style, etc., that need the Party to address? The fact is not so. For example, the style of the company's deputy manager, Comrade Sun Liji (Communist Party member), is a matter worth discussing. Comrade Sun Liji does not like lower-level cadres to raise opinions different from his, and he rarely considers whether the opinions are correct or not. Everything only counts if Comrade Sun Liji says so, and others can only follow suit. Comrade Sun Liji likes to scold lower-level staff, and almost every lower-level cadre who has interacted with him has been scolded by him. Once, during a conversation with international friends, Comrade Sun Liji scolded a translator to the point of bursting into tears on the spot. Regarding Comrade Sun Liji's rude style, many Party members have asked the branch to have Comrade Sun Liji make a public self-criticism and correct his mistakes. But the Party branch secretary's reply is always that the branch committee needs to “study it.” A month, two months, a year has passed, and the branch has not yet “studied” any results. What the branch secretary said about “studying” is actually a euphemism for “dragging.” Everyone has a lot of opinions about this approach of the branch. Some comrades, when mentioning Comrade Sun Liji's style, say: "The Party organization doesn't dare to manage him, how dare we provoke him? We can only stay away from him."
    There are many other problems in this branch: some Party members have quite serious individualistic thoughts and are sluggish and irresponsible in their work; individual Party members are not united. The branch also turns a blind eye to these and does not care about them. On the other hand, there are also many good Party members in our branch who have consistently been proactive and responsible in their work, worked diligently, and made many achievements. However, the branch seems to have not seen these excellent Party members and has not praised or encouraged them. Not promptly criticizing the shortcomings of Party members, and not promptly praising the advantages of Party members, this is the main characteristic of our branch's work. Everyone has a lot of opinions about this situation, but I don’t know why the Party Committee of the Ministry of Foreign Trade has always turned a deaf ear and a blind eye to this situation?

### 对好的不表扬对坏的不批评

专栏：党员来信

    编者按　不少党组织的生活不活跃，限制了党员们的积极性和创造性。因此很多党员要求迅速改变这种状况。这个要求是正确的，应当得到支持。
    但是要改变这种状况，首先就得弄清楚障碍究竟在哪里。下面发表的两封党员来信都是就他们的支部生活提出了问题。我们希望大家能从更多方面揭发党组织生活不活跃的状况和原因，并且提出改进的办法，好使党组织的生活很快活跃起来。
    对好的不表扬对坏的不批评编辑同志：
    我到北京中国杂品出口公司工作已经一年多。到公司不久，我就感觉到这里党的组织生活很不活跃。去年下半年除召开过一两次支部大会谈一谈肃反问题以外，党支部几乎再没有什么活动。今年年初，不少党员对党的组织生活的沉闷提出了许多意见，这以后党组织的活动比以前虽然多些，但是，在党员大会和小组会上，不外是传达上级党委指示、总结支部工作、讨论候补党员转正和对个别党员的纪律处分等。这些问题都是应该讨论的，可是，仅只讨论这些，而不接触到大家工作、学习、生活、思想作风中的问题，党组织的生活就很难活跃起来。是不是这个支部的党员的思想作风等方面没有什么问题需要党来过问呢？事实并不是这样。比如，公司的副经理孙立基同志（共产党员）的作风就是个值得讨论的问题。孙立基同志不喜欢下级干部提出和他不同的意见，不论所提意见正确与否他都很少考虑。一切事情只有孙立基同志说了算数，别人只能照办。孙立基同志好骂下级工作人员，和他接触过的下级干部几乎都挨过他的骂。有一次在和国际友人谈话的时候，孙立基同志把一个翻译工作同志骂得当场放声大哭起来。对于孙立基同志的这种粗暴作风，许多党员都要求支部让孙立基同志做公开检讨，改正错误。但支部书记的答复总是说支委会要
  “研究研究”。一个月，两个月，一年过去了，支部还没有“研究”出个结果来。支部书记所说的“研究”，实际上是“拖”的代用词。大家对支部这种作法很有意见，有些同志一提起孙立基同志的作风问题就说：“党组织还不敢管他，咱还敢惹，只好远而避之。”
    这个支部里的其他问题也很多：有一些党员个人主义思想相当严重，工作疲疲沓沓不负责任；个别党员之间闹不团结。支部对这些也是睁一只眼闭一只眼，不管不问。另一方面我们支部里也有不少好党员，他们对工作一贯积极负责、埋头苦干，做出了不少成绩，可是，支部对这些优秀的党员也好像没有看见一样，对他们也没有表扬过，鼓励过。对党员的缺点不及时批评，对党员的优点也不及时表扬，这就是我们支部工作的主要特点。大家对这种情况很有意见，可是不知道为什么对外贸易部党委会对这种情况却一直闻而不问，视而不管？
