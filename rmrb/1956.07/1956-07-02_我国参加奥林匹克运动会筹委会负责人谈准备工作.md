Person in Charge of China's Olympic Games Preparatory Committee Discusses Preparations

The 16th Olympic Games, to be held in November, are getting closer and closer. People are concerned and ask: How are our preparations going?

When the reporter visited the person in charge of the Preparatory Committee for China's participation in the 16th Olympic Games, he also raised the same question.

The person in charge of the Preparatory Committee said: The Chinese delegation participating in the 16th Olympic Games will be a relatively large team. It includes athletes in seven events: football, basketball, track and field, swimming, gymnastics, weightlifting, and shooting.

The selection of athletes has already begun. Because the Chinese football team has a preliminary qualifying match for the Olympic football tournament against the Philippine football team, the selection of football players started the earliest. The Chinese football team arrived in Calcutta, India in early June. Due to the Philippine football team's withdrawal, the Chinese football team has already qualified for the competition in Melbourne. This football team will also be the Chinese football team representing the games in Melbourne.

After the national competition, the Chinese basketball team has also been basically formed. The Chinese basketball team, which recently visited Romania and Poland, will be the foundation of the Chinese delegation to the competition in Melbourne. Most of the team members are from the two best teams in our country—the Beijing Sports Institute team and the Chinese People's Liberation Army "August 1st" team. Before going abroad, they played against the French Labor Sports Federation basketball team and won 80 to 38. And it was well received by French friends.

When talking about the selection of athletes in swimming, track and field, weightlifting, gymnastics, and shooting, the person in charge of the Preparatory Committee said: Because the national competitions for these events have not yet been held, it is still difficult to say which athletes will be the future Olympic athletes.

Is it possible for Chinese athletes to win some victories in the 16th Olympic Games? The person in charge of the Preparatory Committee also made some prospects and estimates on this issue.

Since the International Olympic Committee recognized the Chinese Olympic Committee in 1924, China has participated in four Olympic Games. But only pole vaulter Fu Baolu won the right to the finals in the 10th Olympic Games in 1936. In recent years, some young and talented athletes have emerged in China. Judging from their current achievements, it is possible to compete with outstanding athletes from various countries. In weightlifting, Chen Jingkai, a 20-year-old athlete, recently created a world record in the clean and jerk in the lightest weight class. His total score exceeded 300 kilograms, and he is a very promising athlete. Others, such as Xue Deming, Chen Yongbo, Zhu Hongquan, and Huang Qianghui, athletes in the lightest weight class, featherweight class, and lightweight class, have also reached the top six results of the 15th Olympic Games.

Among female athletes, discus thrower Shi Baozhu is relatively outstanding. In 1955, she reached a score of nearly 46 meters. In 1956, her scores are still rising. Sprinter Jiang Yumin's 100-meter time is 12.1 seconds. Fu Xueyan once jumped a height of 1.61 meters. Compared with the results of the previous Olympic Games, these results are also good.

In swimming, there are also some athletes with better results. Lin Jinzhu, an athlete who came from a peasant background and once served in the People's Liberation Army, has achieved 58.7 seconds in the 100-meter freestyle, which is equal to the sixth-place result in the same event in the 15th Olympic Games. There are also some athletes in butterfly and breaststroke who are close to international levels.

The person in charge of the Preparatory Committee finally told reporters: It is not easy to win in the Olympic Games with outstanding athletes from various countries participating. However, it is believed that the 16th Olympic Games is a beginning for Chinese athletes to advance side by side with athletes from various countries. (Wu Xuan)

### 我国参加奥林匹克运动会筹委会负责人谈准备工作

    我国参加奥林匹克运动会筹委会负责人谈准备工作
    离十一月举行的第十六届奥林匹克运动会是愈来愈近了。人们关心地问：我们的准备工作做得怎样了？
    记者在访问我国参加第十六届奥运会筹备委员会的负责人的时候，也提出了同样的问题。
    筹备委员会的负责人说：参加十六届奥运会的中国代表团，将是一个比较大的队伍。它包括足球、篮球、田径、游泳、体操、举重、射击七个项目的运动员。
    选拔运动员的工作已经开始了。因为中国足球队要和菲律宾足球队作一次参加奥运会足球赛的预选赛，所以足球运动员的选拔工作开始得最早。中国足球队在六月初就到了印度的加尔各答，由于菲律宾足球队的弃权，中国足球队已经获得了去墨尔本比赛的资格。这支足球队，也将是去墨尔本的中国足球队代表队。
    经过了全国的比赛以后，中国的篮球队也基本上组成。最近去罗马尼亚和波兰访问的中国篮球队，将是去墨尔本比赛的中国代表队的基础。这个球队的队员，大部分是我国最好的两个球队——北京体育学院队和中国人民解放军“八一”队的队员。他们在出国访问前，曾和法国劳动体育联合会篮球队进行了比赛，结果以八十比三十八获胜。并且得到法国朋友们的好评。
    在谈到游泳、田径、举重、体操和射击等项目运动员的选拔工作的时候，筹委会的负责人说：因为这些项目的全国性比赛还没有举行，因此还难说哪些运动员将是未来的参加奥运会的选手。
    在十六届奥运会中，中国运动员有没有可能获得一些优胜呢？筹委会的负责人对这个问题也作了一些瞻望和估计。
    从1924年国际奥委会承认中国奥委会以来，中国已经参加过四届奥运会。但是只有撑竿跳选手符保卢一人在1936年第十届奥运会上获得过决赛权。近几年来，中国涌现了一些年青的有才能的选手，从他们现在已经达到的成绩来看，是有可能和各国优秀选手相竞争的。在举重运动中，最近创造了一项最轻级挺举世界纪录，年仅二十岁的运动员陈竞开，他的总成绩超过了三百公斤，他是一个很有希望的选手。其他像最轻级、次轻级和轻量级中的运动员薛德明，陈永博、朱鸿全、黄强辉等，他们也达到了十五届奥运会前六名的成绩。
    在女运动员中，掷铁饼选手石宝珠是较优秀的。在1955年，她就达到了近四十六公尺的成绩。在1956年中，她的成绩还在上升。短距离跑运动员姜玉民的一百公尺是十二秒一。傅雪雁曾经跳过一公尺六十一公分的高度。这些成绩和上一届奥运会的成绩来比较，也算是好的。
    在游泳运动中，也有一些成绩较好的选手。农民出身又曾经参加过人民解放军的运动员林锦珠，他的一百公尺自由泳已达到五十八秒七，和十五届奥运会同一个项目第六名的成绩相等。在蝶泳和蛙泳中也有一些接近国际水平的运动员。
    筹委会负责人最后告诉记者说：要在各国优秀运动员参加的奥运会中获胜，不是轻而易举的事。但是，相信十六届奥运会是中国运动员和各国运动员并肩前进的一个开端。　（吴宣）
