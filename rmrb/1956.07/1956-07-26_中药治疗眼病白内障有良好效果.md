Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, July 21st. The Ophthalmology Teaching and Research Group of Sichuan Medical College, in cooperation with traditional Chinese and Western medicine, has achieved good results in treating cataracts with the traditional Chinese medicine "Cishi Zhuzhu Wan" (Magnetite Pearl Pill).

From December of last year to June of this year, among the 41 cases and 72 eyes treated with "Cishi Zhuzhu Wan," vision was restored or improved in 40 eyes, and vision was controlled and did not continue to deteriorate in 32 eyes. When patient Qu Zongyong first entered the hospital, he suffered from complicated cataracts, and he could only see a mass of black when looking at anything. After taking "Cishi Zhuzhu Wan" for 20 days, he was able to clearly see the words on newspapers, and his vision nearly recovered.

Modern ophthalmology treats cataracts caused by clouding of the crystalline lens by surgically removing the lens after it has completely clouded. However, this surgical procedure is very complex, difficult, and can easily cause damage to the eyeball. Treatment of cataracts with "Cishi Zhuzhu Wan" is not only highly effective, but also has no side effects whatsoever.

    中药治疗眼病白内障
    有良好效果
    新华社成都21日电　四川医学院眼科教研组中西医合作，应用中药“磁珠丸”治疗眼病白内障，获得良好效果。
     从去年十二月到今年六月，用“磁珠丸”治疗的四十一个病例、七十二只眼中，视力恢复或增强者有四十只，视力被控制原状，未继续恶化者有三十二只。病人瞿宗永初进医院的时候，患并发性的白内障，看任何物体都是一团黑，服用二十天“磁珠丸”后，便能看清书报上的字，视力接近恢复。
    现代眼科医学治疗由眼球晶状体混浊而产生的白内障，必须等晶状体完全混浊后，再施行手术加以摘除。但是，这种手术操作过程很复杂，困难又多，容易造成眼球损坏的危险。用“磁珠丸”治疗白内障，不仅疗效很高，而且没有丝毫副作用。
