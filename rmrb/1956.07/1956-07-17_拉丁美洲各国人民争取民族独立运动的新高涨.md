The economies of Latin American countries have developed to varying degrees after the two World Wars, especially in the decade since World War II. Brazil, Mexico, Argentina, and Chile have all established some iron and steel smelting industries. For example, last year, Brazil's industrial production increased by 68% compared to 1946, and steel production reached 1.33 million tons.

At the same time, the national capital of Latin American countries has gradually grown and has begun to become a force that cannot be ignored in the economies of various countries. In Argentina's industry, domestic capital has exceeded foreign capital. Mexico's state-owned oil industry produces 9 million barrels of oil annually, and 18 new oil fields were opened last year. Brazil's largest steel enterprise is state-owned, aluminum production is controlled by national capital, and many textile factories are also operated by national capital. In Venezuela, national financial capital has also developed, and economic organizations of national capitalists have been established to deal with foreign monopoly capital.

With the development of industrial production, the ranks of the working class are growing. The industrial workers of Argentina, Brazil, and Mexico have all exceeded 1 million.

However, due to the control of foreign monopoly capital, especially American monopoly capital, the independent development of the national economies of Latin American countries is still greatly hindered. American monopoly capital groups have invested more than $7 billion in Latin America. Most, or even the vast majority, of the major production undertakings and foreign trade of Latin American countries are controlled by American monopoly capital groups. American capital controls 95% of Chile's copper production, 80% of Mexico's mining industry, 75% of South America's known oil reserves, and almost all fruit production in the Caribbean, Central America, and Colombia. Trade with the United States accounts for more than 70% of the total foreign trade of Mexico, Cuba, and Colombia. Moreover, American monopoly capital is trying every means to infiltrate enterprises operated by national capital in Latin American countries. The "Paz del Río" metallurgical factory in Colombia, which took twelve years to build and was completed last October, was refused any financial and technical assistance by the United States during its construction, but now it is attempting to control the enterprise under the pretext of providing loans for its expansion.

In recent years, while forcing Latin American countries to implement embargoes against socialist countries, American imperialism has also used methods such as raising tariffs, lowering prices, and setting import quotas to prevent the import of Latin American countries' commodities into the United States. At the same time, it is dumping surplus agricultural products in Latin America. These practices of American imperialism have seriously damaged the interests of Latin American countries, caused financial difficulties for Latin American countries, and made the people of Latin America live an increasingly impoverished life.

Therefore, the contradictions between Latin American countries and the United States are becoming increasingly acute. The desire of the people of Latin American countries to get rid of the control and plunder of American imperialism is very strong.

II

Under the influence of the increasingly easing international situation and the growing struggle of Asian and African countries against colonialism after the Bandung Conference, the struggle of the Latin American people for national independence and democratic freedom has reached a new high. More and more business and political figures are also joining the ranks of this struggle. In some countries, people from all walks of life have widely united to become a powerful patriotic force.

Last October, Brazil—the largest country in Latin America—held presidential elections. The Brazilian people generally supported the candidates of the Social Democratic Party and the Labor Party, who proposed to defend national independence, defend the constitution, develop the national economy, and improve the people's livelihood, to be elected as president and vice president. The pro-American faction, which was defeated in the election, attempted to launch a coup to obstruct the elected president and vice president from taking office, but was opposed by the people of the whole country, including the vast majority of members of Congress and soldiers led by the Minister of the Army of Brazil. The reactionary coup plot was defeated.

At the beginning of this year, the Chilean people launched a huge movement against the United States forcing Chile to accept the "Klein-Saks" plan, which would harm Chile's economy and benefit American monopoly capital. This so-called price, wage, and pension stabilization plan was proposed to the Chilean government by a delegation from Klein Saks, a private enterprise consulting firm in the United States, taking advantage of Chile's economic difficulties. If this plan were implemented, the purchasing power of the working people would be greatly reduced, taxes would be increased, and 23,000 employees would be laid off.

In the tide of worker strikes and protests and public accusations against the United States by many members of Congress and public leaders, Chile's six major parties, including the Socialist Party, the Labor Party, the Communist Party, the Democratic Party, the People's Socialist Party, and the People's Democratic Party, formed the Popular Action Front. They took unified action against the American "Klein-Saks" economic plan, which harmed national interests, and the repressive policies pursued by the Ibáñez government. In a joint statement, they proposed fighting for the people's freedom, abolishing persecutory laws, fighting for the rights of the working people, fighting for the restoration of extensive trade relations with all countries, and opposing the enslavement of Chile by imperialists as their goals. Their program was generally supported by the Chilean people. In the by-elections for two members of the House of Representatives of the Chilean Congress in April of this year, a Communist and a Radical Party candidate supported by the Popular Action Front were victorious.

The events that occurred in Brazil and Chile show that the struggle of the Latin American people for national independence and democratic freedom is playing an increasingly important role and influence in the political life of Latin America.

III

Some government officials and government leaders in Latin American countries have gradually realized in their own countries' experiences what American monopoly capital brings to their countries. Under the influence and impetus of the new international and domestic situation, they openly condemn the United States' plundering policies, advocate carrying out international cooperation and free trade on an equal and mutually beneficial basis, and demand respect for their countries' independence and sovereignty.

Last December, Uruguayan State Council Chairman Batlle publicly criticized the United States' tariff barrier policy during his visit to the United States, and he criticized the United States' dumping as "not a just act of peace."

This March, Costa Rican President Figueres Ferrer wrote an article in Uruguay's "Adelante" criticizing the United States' plundering policies. He said that American monopoly capital only hopes to have cheap labor for them to exploit in order to maintain their comfortable lives and opposes Costa Rica's economic development.

In several international conferences held in the past year, the attitudes of Latin American countries' representatives reflected the anti-American sentiment and the centrifugal tendency of Latin American countries toward the United States.

At the 10th United Nations General Assembly last year, representatives of many Latin American countries took a stand against colonialism and in support of international cooperation in the discussions of colonial issues and the admission of new member states. When the Social, Humanitarian, and Cultural Committee of the United Nations General Assembly discussed the issue of national self-determination, fourteen Latin American countries voted in favor of including provisions recognizing the right to national self-determination and the right of all peoples to dispose of their natural resources in the draft international human rights covenant. In the discussion of the "economic development of underdeveloped countries," twenty Latin American countries, disregarding the opposition of the United States, jointly proposed a proposal requesting the United Nations to establish a fund to provide low-interest loans to underdeveloped countries.

During the General Assembly, U.S. Representative Lodge hoped that Latin American countries "could achieve unity of action" on the issues discussed by the General Assembly "in the spirit of Pan-American cooperation." These actions of Latin American countries at the General Assembly are a good answer to Lodge's "hope."

The issue of territorial sea breadth has always been a point of contention between Latin American countries and the United States. In order to facilitate fishing, seize the undersea oil and other mineral resources off the coasts of Latin American countries discovered in recent years, and exert military control over Latin America, the United States advocates limiting the scope of territorial waters to three nautical miles and touts "freedom of the high seas" to cover up its aggression. However, when the Third Conference of the Pan American Council of Jurists discussed this issue in January of this year, many countries, including Chile, Ecuador, Guatemala, and Uruguay, unanimously opposed the United States' position. The conference passed a resolution by an overwhelming majority that American countries have the right to determine the scope of their own territorial waters, with only the United States opposing. At the Pan American Conference on the Protection of Resources and Territorial Sea Rights held in mid-March, the United States engaged in diplomatic activities in advance in an attempt to get Latin American countries to change their positions, but Latin American countries' opposition to the United States remained unchanged. Agreements were not reached on many issues at the conference, and shortly after the conference, Mexico detained ten fishing boats that had intruded into Mexican territorial waters.

This February, Uruguayan State Council Chairman Batlle suggested holding a meeting with the presidents of Brazil and Argentina to discuss the common problems of the three countries, such as protecting the weak industries of Latin American countries and adopting a common policy toward the United States' dumping.

After this suggestion was published, the heads of the governments of Argentina and Brazil quickly expressed their approval, and the presidents of both countries expressed their willingness to participate. Argentina and Brazil are the two largest countries in Latin America. The development of relations between these two countries is a significant event in Latin America.

It is reported that this meeting will be held at the end of this year, and Chile, Paraguay, Bolivia, and other countries will also be invited to participate.

The strengthening of unity and cooperation among Latin American countries will undoubtedly make American imperialism's war policies and plundering policies more isolated and promote the further easing of the international situation. At the same time, it will also play a positive role in maintaining and consolidating the sovereignty and independence of Latin American countries.

IV

From the perspective of Latin American countries expanding economic relations with Europe and with socialist countries in recent years, it can also be clearly seen that the countries and people of Latin America are urgently demanding to get rid of their dependence on the United States and alleviate the economic difficulties they face.

In order to reduce the consumption of US dollars and obtain more reasonable prices for exports, many Latin American countries have been constantly expanding trade with Western European countries in recent years. Last year and this spring, Brazil signed multilateral trade payment agreements with West Germany, Britain, the Netherlands, Italy, Belgium, Luxembourg, and other countries. Trade between Argentina, Venezuela, Paraguay, Bolivia, Uruguay, and other countries and Western European countries such as Britain and West Germany has also increased.

In recent years, trade relations between Latin American countries and socialist countries have developed to a certain extent. According to the 1955 trade agreement, the trade volume between Latin American countries and socialist countries reached 500 million US dollars. Brazil's trade volume with socialist countries last year was 70 million US dollars, which is equal to the trade volume between all Latin American countries and socialist countries in 1953. Now, Poland has become the main supplier of coal for Argentina, and Argentina imports a large amount of oil from the Soviet Union. Other countries such as Uruguay, Chile, Colombia, and Cuba have signed trade payment agreements or have trade relations with the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, Poland, East Germany, and other countries.

Although trade between Latin American countries and our country has not yet been universally developed, trade contacts between Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Mexico, Uruguay, and other countries and our country are gradually increasing. Our country's trade with Latin American countries has broad prospects.

While developing trade relations, friendly exchanges between the people of Latin American countries and the people of socialist countries have also expanded. From January to June of this year, 106 people from nine Latin American countries in various fields such as economics, culture, medicine, trade unions, and women visited our country. In May and June of this year, the delegation of Brazilian members of Congress visited Czechoslovakia, Poland, Yugoslavia, Hungary, and the Soviet Union successively. Five members of the delegation also visited our country for ten days at the invitation of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of our country.

The peaceful and friendly relations between Latin American countries and socialist countries are developing more and more extensively. This relationship helps the independent development of Latin American countries.

Because Latin American countries have been plundered and enslaved by foreign monopoly capital for a long time, their economies almost all depend on the export of one or two kinds of agricultural and livestock products or mineral products, and their economic lifelines are almost all controlled by imperialism, especially American imperialism. In order to maintain its monopoly position in Latin America, American imperialism uses its regional advantages to interfere in the internal affairs of Latin American countries by any means in order to undermine the sovereignty and independence of Latin American countries. The intervention of American imperialism in Guatemala in June 1954, which overthrew the then-democratic government of Arbenz, is a typical example. Therefore, Latin American countries must go through a difficult and tortuous struggle in order to get rid of imperialist control and achieve completely independent and autonomous development in politics and economy. However, the Latin American people will not retreat because of the coercion of American imperialism. The struggle of the people of Latin American countries for national independence will surely develop vigorously and achieve greater achievements.

    拉丁美洲各国人民争取民族独立运动的新高涨
    梅尔	一
    拉丁美洲国家的经济，经过两次世界大战，特别是第二次世界大战以后的十年来，有了不同程度的发展。巴西、墨西哥、阿根廷和智利等国都已建立了一些钢铁冶炼工业。例如，去年，巴西的工业生产比1946年提高了68％，钢产量已达133万吨。
    同时，拉丁美洲各国的民族资本也逐渐成长起来，在各国的经济中开始成为一个不可忽视的力量。在阿根廷的工业中本国资本已经超过了外国资本。墨西哥的国营石油业年产石油达九百万桶，去年还新开辟了十八处油田。巴西最大的钢铁企业是国营的，铝的生产由民族资本掌握，很多纺织工厂也由民族资本经营。在委内瑞拉，民族金融资本也发展了起来，而且还建立了对付外国垄断资本的民族资本家的经济组织。
    随着工业生产的发展，工人阶级的队伍日益壮大。阿根廷、巴西、墨西哥的产业工人都已超过100万。
    但是由于外国垄断资本，特别是美国垄断资本的控制，拉丁美洲各国国民经济的独立发展仍然受到极大的阻碍。美国垄断资本集团在拉丁美洲的投资已超过70亿美元。拉丁美洲各国的主要的生产事业和对外贸易有大部分，甚至极大部分被美国垄断资本集团掌握。美国资本控制了智利铜的生产的95％，墨西哥开矿业的80％，南美已知石油蕴藏量的75％以及加勒比海区、中美洲和哥伦比亚几乎全部的果品生产。墨西哥、古巴、哥伦比亚对美国的贸易占了它们整个对外贸易的70％以上。而且美国垄断资本还在千方百计地设法渗入拉丁美洲各国本国资本经营的企业中去。经过十二年修建才于去年十月建成的哥伦比亚“巴斯得里奥”冶金工厂，美国曾在它的筹建期间拒绝给予任何财政和技术援助，而现在又借口要提供贷款扩建工厂，企图控制这个企业。
    近年来，美国帝国主义一面强迫拉丁美洲国家对社会主义国家实施禁运，一面又用提高关税、压低价格、规定入口限额等办法来阻止拉丁美洲国家的商品输入美国。同时，还在拉丁美洲倾销剩余农产品。美国帝国主义的这些做法严重地损害了拉丁美洲各国的利益，引起了拉丁美洲国家的财政困难，使拉丁美洲的人民过着越来越贫困的生活。
    因此，拉丁美洲国家同美国的矛盾日益尖锐化。拉丁美洲各国人民要求摆脱美帝国主义的控制和掠夺的愿望非常强烈。	二
    在国际局势日趋和缓和万隆会议以后亚非国家反对殖民主义的斗争日益发展的影响下，拉丁美洲人民争取民族独立和民主自由的斗争有了新的高涨。越来越多的工商界和政界人士也参加到这个斗争的行列里来。在有些国家里，各阶层人民已经广泛地团结起来成为一个强大的爱国力量。
    去年十月，拉丁美洲最大的国家——巴西——举行总统选举。巴西人民普遍支持提出要保卫民族独立、保卫宪法、发展本国经济、改善人民生活的社会民主党和工党的候选人当选为总统和副总统。在选举中遭到失败的亲美派，企图发动政变以阻挠当选的总统和副总统就位，但是遭到全国人民，包括绝大多数国会议员和以巴西陆军部长为首的军人的反对。反动派的政变阴谋被击败了。
    今年年初，智利人民掀起了一个巨大的运动，反对美国迫使智利接受损害智利经济而有利于美国垄断资本的“克伦—萨克斯”计划。这个所谓物价、工资和养老金稳定计划，是美国的一家私人企业咨询公司——克伦·萨克斯公司的代表团，利用智利的经济困难向智利政府提出的。实行这个计划，劳动人民的购买力将大大降低，赋税将增加，并且要把二万三千个职员解雇。
    在工人罢工抗议和很多国会议员、公众领袖对美国进行公开指责的浪潮中，智利的六个大党，包括社会党、劳工党、共产党、民主党、人民社会党和人民民主党，成立了人民行动阵线。它们采取统一行动反对美国“克伦—萨克斯”损害民族利益的经济计划和伊巴涅斯政府所奉行的镇压政策。它们在联合声明中提出以争取人民自由、取消迫害性法律、争取劳动人民的权利、争取同各国恢复广泛的贸易关系、反对帝国主义者奴役智利等作为它们的奋斗目标。它们的纲领得到智利人民的普遍拥护。在今年四月智利国会两个众议员的补选中，一个共产党和一个得到人民行动阵线支持的激进党候选人获得了胜利。
    巴西和智利发生的事件表明：拉丁美洲人民争取民族独立和民主自由的斗争正在拉丁美洲的政治生活中起着越来越大的作用和影响。	三
    拉丁美洲国家中的一些政府人员和政府领导人员，在他们自己国家的遭遇中逐渐认识到美国垄断资本给他们国家带来的是什么。在国际和国内新形势的影响和推动下，他们公开谴责美国的掠夺政策，赞成开展平等互利的国际合作和自由贸易，要求尊重他们国家的独立和主权。
    去年十二月，乌拉圭国务会议主席巴特叶在美国访问时就公开指责美国的关税壁垒政策，他并批评美国的倾销“不是一种正当的和平的行动。”
    今年三月，哥斯达黎加总统菲格雷斯文在乌拉圭的“前进报”上撰文抨击美国的掠夺政策。他说，美国垄断资本只希望有廉价的劳动力供他们剥削以维持他们的舒适生活，而反对哥斯达黎加的经济发展。
    在最近一年来所举行的几次国际会议中，拉丁美洲国家代表的态度反映了拉丁美洲国家的反美情绪和对美国的离心倾向。
    去年的第十届联合国大会上，不少拉丁美洲国家的代表在殖民地问题、新会员国入会问题的讨论中，都采取了反对殖民主义和支持国际合作的立场。在联合国大会社会、人道及文化委员会讨论民族自决问题时，十四个拉丁美洲国家投票赞成在国际人权公约草案中列入承认民族自决权和各国人民有权处理本国自然资源的条款。在讨论“落后国家的经济发展”问题时，拉丁美洲二十个国家不顾美国的反对，联合提出一个提案，要求联合国设立一项基金，用低利贷款给落后国家。
    美国代表洛奇在大会期间希望拉丁美洲国家“能够根据泛美合作的精神”对大会讨论的问题“取得行动一致。”拉丁美洲国家在大会上的这些表现，对洛奇的“希望”是一个很好的回答。
    领海宽度问题一直是拉丁美洲国家同美国发生争执的一个问题。美国为了捕鱼的便利，攫取近年来发现的拉丁美洲国家沿海的海底石油和其他矿产资源，以及对拉丁美洲军事上的控制，主张将领海范围限在三浬内，并高唱“公海自由”来掩盖它的侵略行为。但是在今年一月的泛美法学家理事会第三届会议讨论这个问题时，智利、厄瓜多尔、危地马拉、乌拉圭等许多国家一致反对美国的主张。会上以绝大多数票通过美洲国家有权决定自己领海范围的决议，只有美国一国反对。三月中举行的泛美保护资源和领海权问题会议，美国曾在事先进行外交活动，企图使拉丁美洲国家改变立场，但是拉丁美洲国家反对美国的态度仍旧没有改变。很多问题在会上都没有取得协议，会后不久，墨西哥就扣留了十艘侵入墨西哥领海的捕鱼船。
    今年二月，乌拉圭国务会议主席巴特叶建议同巴西、阿根廷两国总统举行一次会议来讨论保卫拉丁美洲国家的弱小工业、对美国的倾销采取一个共同的政策等三国共同的问题。
    这个建议发表后，阿根廷和巴西两国政府的负责人很快就表示赞同，两国总统都表示愿意参加。阿根廷和巴西是拉丁美洲两个大国。这两国之间关系的发展在拉丁美洲是一个具有重大的意义的事件。
    据报道，这个会议将在今年年底举行，而且还将邀请智利、巴拉圭、玻利维亚等国参加。
    拉丁美洲国家间团结合作的加强，无疑地将使美帝国主义的战争政策和掠夺政策更加孤立，并促进国际局势的进一步和缓。同时，它对维护和巩固拉丁美洲国家的主权和独立也必将起积极的作用。四
    从近年来拉丁美洲国家同欧洲以及同社会主义各国家扩大经济关系这方面来看，也能清楚地看到拉丁美洲的国家和人民迫切要求摆脱对美国的依附和解除它们所面临的经济困难。
    不少拉丁美洲国家为了减少美元的消耗，并使出口品得到较合理的价格，近年来不断扩展同西欧国家的贸易。去年和今年春，巴西同西德、英国、荷兰、意大利、比利时、卢森堡等国签订了多边贸易支付协定。阿根廷、委内瑞拉、巴拉圭、玻利维亚、乌拉圭等同英国、西德等西欧国家的贸易也有增加。
    近年来，拉丁美洲国家同社会主义国家的贸易关系有了一定的发展。按照1955年的贸易协定，拉丁美洲各国同社会主义国家间的贸易额达五亿美元。巴西去年同社会主义国家的贸易额是七千万美元，等于1953年整个拉丁美洲国家同社会主义国家的贸易额。现在，波兰成了阿根廷用煤的主要供应者，阿根廷并从苏联输入大量石油。其他如乌拉圭、智利、哥伦比亚、古巴等国同苏联、捷克斯洛伐克、波兰、民主德国等国都签订了贸易支付协定或有了贸易往来。
    拉丁美洲国家同我国的贸易虽然还没有普遍展开，但是阿根廷、巴西、智利、墨西哥、乌拉圭等国同我国的贸易接触日渐增多。我国同拉丁美洲各国的贸易有着广阔的前途。
    在发展贸易关系的同时，拉丁美洲国家同社会主义阵营国家人民之间的友好往来也扩大了。今年一月到六月，已有九个拉丁美洲国家，106个经济、文化、医学、工会、妇女等各方面的人士来我国访问。今年五月和六月，巴西国会议员代表团先后访问了捷克斯洛伐克、波兰、南斯拉夫、匈牙利和苏联。代表团中的五位议员还应我国人民代表大会常务委员会的邀请来我国访问了十天。
    拉丁美洲各国同社会主义国家间的和平友好关系正在日益广泛的开展起来。这种关系有助于拉丁美洲国家独立的发展。
    由于拉丁美洲国家长时期来一直遭到外国垄断资本的掠夺和奴役，它们的经济几乎都依赖于一两种农牧产品或矿产品的出口，它们的经济命脉几乎都为帝国主义，特别是美帝国主义掌握。美帝国主义为了保持它在拉丁美洲的垄断地位，利用它在地区上的有利条件，不惜采取粗暴的手段干涉拉丁美洲国家的内政以破坏拉丁美洲国家的主权和独立。1954年6月，美帝国主义对危地马拉的干涉，推翻了当时的阿本斯民主政府就是一个典型的事例。因此拉丁美洲国家要摆脱帝国主义的控制，在政治上和经济上获得完全独立自主的发展，还必须经过一番艰苦、曲折的斗争。但是拉丁美洲人民是不会因为美帝国主义的胁迫而退缩不前的。拉丁美洲各国人民争取民族独立的斗争一定会蓬蓬勃勃地开展起来，并且获得更大的成就。
