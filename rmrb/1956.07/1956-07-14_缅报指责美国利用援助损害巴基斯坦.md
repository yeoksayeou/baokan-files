Xinhua News Agency, Rangoon, July 13th: The Burmese newspaper "People's Daily" said in an editorial on July 12th: "American aid is a means of undermining a country's right to self-determination."

    The newspaper made this comment when commenting on a recent United Press International dispatch from Karachi. The UPI dispatch stated that U.S. officials were deeply concerned about Pakistan's desire to expand ties with People's China.

    The newspaper said that Pakistan had been threatened by the United States that if it established closer relations with People's China, U.S. aid would be reduced. The United States also put pressure on Pakistan to abstain from voting on the issue of admitting People's China to the United Nations. The editorial emphasized that these actions show how much Pakistan's prestige has been damaged by accepting U.S. aid, and how much it is threatened not to do what it thinks is right.

    The newspaper said, whether this concerns us or not, we want to ask this American news agency, how much has Pakistan developed as a result of American aid? Is this news agency willing to admit that after the United States provided 500 million U.S. dollars in aid, 46 million Pakistani people are still starving? Isn't American aid a military aid that forces Pakistan to use its manpower for American interests? Isn't American aid a means to cunningly buy the sovereignty of the countries that accept such aid?

    缅报指责美国利用援助损害巴基斯坦
    新华社仰光13日电　缅甸“人民报”七月十二日的社论说：“美国的援助是破坏一个国家的自决权的手段。”
    这家报纸是在评论美国合众社最近从喀喇蚩发出的一条消息的时候这样说的。合众社的这条消息说，美国官员们对巴基斯坦渴望扩大同人民中国的联系这件事深感忧虑。
    这家报纸说，巴基斯坦受到美国的恫吓说，如果它同人民中国建立更密切的关系，美援就将削减。美国还对巴基斯坦施加压力，迫使它在接纳人民中国加入联合国的问题上弃权。社论强调指出：这些行动表明，由于接受美国的援助，巴基斯坦的声望是受到多么大的损害，它受到多么大的威胁，要它不要做它认为正确的事情。
    这家报纸说，不管这是不是关系到我们的事情，我们想要问这个美国通讯社，巴基斯坦由于得到美国的援助有了多大的发展呢？这个通讯社是否愿意承认在美国提供了五亿美元的援助之后，四千六百万巴基斯坦人民仍然在挨饿吗？难道美国的援助不是一种迫使巴基斯坦为了美国的利益而使用它的人力的军事援助么？难道美国的援助不是一种用来收买接受这种援助的国家的主权的狡猾目的的手段么？
