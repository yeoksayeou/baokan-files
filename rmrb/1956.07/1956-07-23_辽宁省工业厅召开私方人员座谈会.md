Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 20th—The Liaoning Provincial Department of Industry recently convened a symposium of private sector personnel among the factory directors of joint state-private enterprises to listen to their opinions and criticisms on the enterprises' economic reorganization, business management, and the relationship between the public and private sectors since the implementation of joint state-private ownership.

The private sector personnel present unanimously affirmed the great achievements made in the transformation of enterprises and the ideological transformation of private sector personnel since the implementation of joint state-private ownership. They also pointed out that in the economic reorganization, some factories relocated and merged without sufficient investigation and research, disrupting the original cooperative relationships. In terms of enterprise management, the main factory took on too much, management was overly centralized, some enterprises inappropriately increased institutions and created superfluous personnel, increasing non-production expenses, and some blindly copied the various systems of state-owned enterprises. Some private sector personnel criticized the public representatives for not paying enough attention to uniting them in their work.

At the meeting, the private sector personnel examined their shortcomings of lacking initiative and having feelings of inferiority in their work. They raised some opinions and requests regarding the study and welfare benefits of the private sector personnel, and expressed satisfaction with holding such a symposium, believing that it could help them improve their sense of responsibility as state workers, and requested that such meetings be held frequently or regularly in the future.

Yang Yunzhi, Deputy Director of the Liaoning Provincial Department of Industry, spoke at the meeting. He expressed sincere acceptance of the opinions raised by the private sector personnel, and said that such meetings would be held frequently in the future to discuss and improve the work together. He also encouraged the private sector personnel to be bold and responsible, change their style, rely on the masses, and work together to do a good job.

    辽宁省工业厅召开私方人员座谈会
    新华社沈阳20日电　辽宁省工业厅最近召集部分公私合营工厂厂长中的私方人员开座谈会，听取他们对企业在公私合营以来，在经济改组、经营管理和公私双方共事关系等方面的意见和批评。
    到会的私方人员一致肯定在实行公私合营以来，企业的改造和私方人员的思想改造都取得了很大的成就。他们也提出，在经济改组中，有的工厂没有经过很好的调查研究就迁厂并厂，以致打乱了原有的协作关系；在企业管理方面，主体厂大包大揽，管理过于集中，有的企业不恰当地增加机构，虚设人员，增加了非生产费用，还有的生搬硬套国营企业的各项制度。有些私方人员批评公方代表在工作中没有很好注意团结他们。
    会上，私方人员检查了他们在工作中缺乏主动性和存在自卑思想的缺点，对私方人员的学习和福利待遇等问题提出一些意见和要求，并且对召开这样的座谈会表示满意，认为这样可以帮助他们提高做国家工作人员的责任感，要求今后经常或定期召开。
    辽宁省工业厅副厅长杨云之在会上发言。他对私方人员提出的意见表示诚恳接受，并说今后将经常召开这样的会，以共同商量，改进工作。他还鼓励私方人员要大胆负责，改变作风，依靠群众，共同做好工作。
