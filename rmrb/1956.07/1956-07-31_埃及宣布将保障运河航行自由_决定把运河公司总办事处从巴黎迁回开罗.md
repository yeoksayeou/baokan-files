Xinhua News Agency, July 30th dispatch from Cairo: According to an official announcement yesterday, Egypt has decided to move the headquarters of the Suez Canal Company from Paris to Cairo.

Egyptian authorities also announced yesterday that the import port of the Suez Canal, Port Said, will henceforth be managed by the Egyptian customs authorities. Previously, this port was managed by the Suez Canal Company. Egypt will soon begin reconstruction work at this port to facilitate the embarkation and disembarkation of passengers and the loading and unloading of cargo. Egypt has accused the Suez Canal Company of neglecting the port facilities of Port Said.

Xinhua News Agency, July 30th dispatch from Cairo: Egyptian Deputy Foreign Minister Abdel Hassan said at a press conference today that "the nationalization of the Suez Canal is purely a financial matter and will not affect its use as a public canal."

He said, "The Egyptian government will guarantee complete freedom of navigation within the canal. Accusations against Egypt by certain countries are excuses for taking political action."

Xinhua News Agency, July 30th dispatch from Cairo: The Middle East News Agency of Egypt refuted the Western countries' claim that freedom of navigation on the Suez Canal would be threatened by the nationalization of the canal.

The news agency said on July 28th that Egypt has no intention of unilaterally controlling freedom of navigation on the Suez Canal. Guaranteeing freedom of navigation on the canal is beneficial to Egypt because it will increase the number of ships passing through the canal. As a result, Egypt's income will increase, Egypt will be able to build the Aswan Dam, and guarantee the prosperity of the Egyptian people.

    埃及宣布将保障运河航行自由    
    决定把运河公司总办事处从巴黎迁回开罗
    新华社30日讯　开罗消息：据官方昨天宣布，埃及已经决定把苏彝士运河公司的总办事处从巴黎迁到开罗。
    埃及当局昨天还宣布，苏彝士运河的进口港塞得港从今以后将由埃及的海关当局管理。以前管理这个港口的是苏彝士运河公司。埃及不久就要在这个港口开始进行改建工作，以便利旅客的上下船和货物的装卸。埃及曾经指责苏彝士运河公司忽视了塞得港的港口设备。
    新华社30日讯　开罗消息：埃及外交部副部长阿卜杜勒·哈桑今天在记者招待会上说，“苏彝士运河国有化纯粹是财政事情，决不影响它是公共使用的运河”。
    他说，“埃及政府将保障运河内航行的完全自由。某些国家对埃及的指责是采取政治行动的借口”。
    新华社30日讯　开罗消息：埃及的中东通讯社驳斥西方国家所谓苏彝士运河的航行自由将因为这条运河国有化而受到威胁的说法。
    这家通讯社七月二十八日说，埃及无意独断控制苏彝士运河的航行自由。保证运河的航行自由，对埃及是有利的，因为这会增加通过运河的船只的数目。从而埃及的收入就会增加，埃及将能够修建阿斯旺水坝，并且保证埃及人民的繁荣。
