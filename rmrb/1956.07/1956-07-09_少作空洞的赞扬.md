　　No one would object to praising good and criticizing evil.
　　Empty praise is as unwelcome as empty criticism is ineffective.
　　During the year, whenever there are commemorations of famous people, newspapers and magazines will publish a large number of commemorative articles. Is this a bad thing? No, it's a good thing. First of all, it should be affirmed that there are many good articles among them. However, along with the good articles, there are also some unsatisfactory works. General introductions of life stories are coupled with empty praise, the accumulation of abstract and brilliant words, but lacking concrete analysis of the works of the commemorated. These articles can be used every year, just by changing the date. Newspapers and magazines feel they have completed their mission and breathed a sigh of relief once they publish the articles. As for whether readers like to read them or not, that is the readers' business.
　　I heard that when newspaper and magazine editorial departments encounter such occasions, they often pull drafts at the last minute. The authors do not have time to make the necessary preparations in advance, and they write hastily overnight. Sometimes the commissioning is inappropriate, and some people who have no research on the commemorated are randomly pulled in to write, so they have to temporarily consult literary history and encyclopedias, piecing together and writing. Some people even translate articles written by foreigners word for word and write their own names on them.
　　A person will feel wronged if he is criticized by someone who does not understand him. Similarly, a person may not feel happy if he is praised by someone who does not understand him. As for those empty praises, if the dead knew, what would they think!
　　Chekhov has a short story depicting a speaker being invited to a memorial service to give a speech. His praise of the deceased is thorough and vivid, and he even breaks down in tears when talking about his death. But in reality, he knows nothing about the deceased, not even his name.
　　The purpose of writing this article is definitely not to tell people not to write commemorative articles, but to ask them to write better and improve the quality. To be good, you need to do more preparation, put in some effort to do some research, don't rush to complete tasks at the last minute, and don't produce shoddy work.
　　The great German poet Lessing has the following lines of poetry:
　　“Who does not praise Klopstock?
　　But will everyone come to read his works? No.
　　We only wish people would compliment us less,
　　And put more effort into reading our works!”

    少作空洞的赞扬
    胡椒
    对善的赞扬和对恶的批评没有人会反对。
    空洞的赞扬之不受欢迎正如空洞的批评一样收不到效果。
    一年间逢到名人纪念日，报纸杂志上总会大批出现纪念文章。难道这是坏事吗？不，这是好事情。首先应当肯定，当中有许多好文章。可是与好文章一起还存在着若干不能令人满意的作品。一般的生平事迹的介绍加上空洞的赞扬，抽象的灿烂的词句堆砌，却缺乏对被纪念者的作品的具体分析。这些文章年年可以用，只消把日期改一下就行。报纸杂志只要把文章发表出去，就算完成了任务，松了一口气。至于读者爱读不爱读，那是读者的事。
    听说报纸杂志的编辑部逢到这样的场合，往往临时拉稿，作者事先没有时间作必要的准备，仓促执笔，连夜赶写出来。有时约稿不恰当，随便拉一些对被纪念者并无研究的人来写，因此不得不临时查文学史，查百科全书，拚拚凑凑写出来。有的人甚至把外国人写的文章一字一句翻译过来而写上自己的名字。
    一个人受到一个对自己不了解的人批评了，是会感到委屈的。同样，一个人倘被一个对自己不了解的人赞扬了，也不一定会感到愉快。对于那些空洞的赞扬，死者有知，将不知作何感想！
    契呵夫有一短篇小说，描写一个演说家被请到一个追悼会上去作演说，他对死者的赞扬，淋漓尽致，说到他的死竟至声泪俱下。可是实际上，他对死者却一无所知，连姓名也不知道。
    我写这篇文章的目的，决不是让人不要写纪念文章，而是要求写得好一点，质量提高一点。要好，就要多作些准备，下点功夫作些研究，不要临时赶任务，不要粗制滥造。
    德国大诗人莱辛有如下的一段诗句：
    “谁不赞美克洛普施托克呢？
    但是是不是每个人都会来阅读他的著作呢？不会的。
    我们唯愿人们少恭维我们一些，
    而多用一点心来阅读我们的著作吧！”
