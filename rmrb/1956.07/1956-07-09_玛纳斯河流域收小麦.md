    Manas River Basin Wheat Harvest
    (Our newspaper, Urumqi) The Production and Construction Corps of the Chinese People's Liberation Army's more than 180,000 mu of wheat planted in the Manas River Basin is generally ripe, and harvesting in some areas began around July 5th. This year, the vast majority of the Manas River Basin is using combines and animal-drawn farm implements for harvesting. It is estimated that the harvest can be completed in seven to ten days. This year, the summer harvest preparation work in various reclamation area farms was more adequate and timely than in previous years. As early as the beginning of June, the harvesting machines were overhauled and test-driven, and at the end of June, animal-drawn harvesters were used for harvesting in some early-maturing areas. In order to finish the summer harvest early, socialist labor competitions have also been launched in various farms. This year, the wheat in various reclamation areas of the Manas River Basin, except for some reduced production due to alkali drought and other reasons, generally has higher yields than in previous years.

    玛纳斯河流域收小麦
    本报乌鲁木齐讯　中国人民解放军生产建设部队在玛纳斯河流域种植的十八万多亩小麦普遍黄熟，部分地区已于七月五日前后开始收割。今年玛纳斯河流域绝大部分使用康拜因和马拉农具进行收割，预计七天到十天就可以收割完毕。今年各垦区农场夏收的准备工作较往年做得充分及时，早在六月初即将收割机器检修试车停当，六月底在部分早熟地区已开始用马拉收割机进行收割。为了提早结束夏收，各农场并开展了社会主义劳动竞赛。今年玛纳斯河流域各垦区小麦，除部分因碱旱和其他原因减产外，一般产量都比往年有所提高。
