    What Does "Day and Night" Tell Us?
    Li Yuan
    Who doesn't admire the colorful and brilliant sunset glow at dusk? The sunset glow brings us the peaceful rest of the night. Who doesn't excitedly welcome the faint morning light before dawn? The morning light tells us the beginning of a new day of labor. Day and night always come one after another. But has anyone ever thought about why there is a distinction between day and night? Then let's take a look at the science education film "Day and Night," which explains this principle to us in a very simple way.
    The Earth we live on does not emit light itself. The light of day comes from the sun's rays. The sun is a star that can emit light and heat itself. Because the Earth is a sphere, sunlight can only illuminate half of it. The side of the Earth facing the sun is daytime; the side facing away from the sun is nighttime. If the Earth were fixed, then one side would always face the sun, and it would always be daytime; the other side would always face away from the sun, and it would always be nighttime. But the Earth is constantly rotating around its axis from west to east, so every place has day and night.
    The Earth rotates regularly from west to east. From the Earth's perspective, the sun appears to rise in the east and set in the west; and daytime also comes to every place on Earth from east to west in sequence. Places to the east see the sun earlier than places to the west, so the time in places to the east is earlier than the time in places to the west. For example, Beijing time is five hours earlier than Moscow time. The film illustrates this principle very interestingly through the shot of the staff on the train from Moscow to Beijing adjusting their watches when they arrive in Manzhouli in our country.
    In summer, the days are long and the nights are short; in winter, the nights are long and the days are short. The film also explains this principle. It turns out that the way the Earth receives sunlight changes due to its revolution around the sun. When sunlight shines directly on the Northern Hemisphere, it is summer in the Northern Hemisphere. In summer, the sun rises from the northeast and sets in the northwest, and the time it spends above the horizon is longer than the time it spends below the horizon, so the day is longer than the night. Conversely, when sunlight shines directly on the Southern Hemisphere, it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere, and the day is shorter than the night.
    The film "Day and Night" explains the scientific principles of the creation of day and night in such an easy-to-understand way. When we see the scenes in the film of people working and studying diligently during the day, we can't help but think of the ancient saying, "Every inch of time is worth an inch of gold." Let us cherish every day and night!

    “白天黑夜”告诉了我们什么？
    李杬
    谁不欣赏黄昏时候的彩色斑烂的晚霞，晚霞给我们带来了可以安恬地休憩的黑夜；谁不振奋地迎接着黎明前熹微的晨光，晨光告诉我们一个新的劳动日的开始。白天和黑夜总是一个接一个地到来。但是可曾有人想过：为什么会有白天和黑夜之分呢？那么让我们看看科学教育影片“白天黑夜”吧，它就很浅显地为我们解释了这个道理。
    我们所住的地球本身不会发光，白天的光，是从太阳上照射过来的。太阳是一个自身能够发光发热的星球。因为地球是一个圆球，所以太阳光只能把它的一半照亮。地球向着太阳光的一面，就是白天；背着太阳光的时候，就是黑夜。如果地球是固定不变的，那么有一面永远迎着太阳光，也就永远是白天；另一面永远背着太阳，也就永远是黑夜了。但是地球是绕着地轴不断地自转的，所以每一处地方都有白天和黑夜。
    地球很有规律地从西向东自转着，从地球上看去，太阳就有着东升西落的现象；而白天也是从东向西地依次来到地球上的每一处地方。靠东边的地方比靠西边的地方先看见太阳，因此靠东边的地方的时间就比靠西边地方的时间早。例如北京时间就比莫斯科时间早五个小时。影片通过从莫斯科开向北京的列车上的工作人员在到达我国满州里的时候把表拨快的镜头，很有趣地说明了这个原理。
    夏天是白天长，黑夜短；冬天却是黑夜长，白天短。这个道理，影片也作了解释。原来地球承受太阳光的情形由于环绕太阳公转而发生变化。当太阳光直射北半球的时候，北半球是夏季。夏季太阳从东北升起到西北落下，在地平线上的时间比在地平线下面的时间长，所以白天也就比黑夜长。相反地，当太阳光直射南半球的时候，北半球是冬季，白天就比黑夜短了。
    影片“白天黑夜”就这样通俗易懂地向我们解释了白天和黑夜产生的科学原理，而当我们看到影片里人们如何在白昼紧张地工作和学习着的镜头，不禁联想起“一寸光阴一寸金”的古谚。让我们珍惜每一个白天和黑夜吧！
