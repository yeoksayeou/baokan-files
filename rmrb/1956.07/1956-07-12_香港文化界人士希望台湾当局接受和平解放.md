Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, July 10th: Some well-known figures in Hong Kong's cultural circles have recently expressed to the Hong Kong press their hope that the Taiwan authorities will accept peaceful liberation and return to the embrace of the motherland at an early date.

    Ma Jian, a professor at the University of Hong Kong, hopes that the negotiations between the government and the Taiwan authorities on the peaceful liberation of Taiwan can be truly realized. He said: "Is there anything that cannot be resolved through consultation? Moreover, we are all our own people. Sitting down and discussing is always much better than fighting."

    Huang Zufen, the principal of Hong Kong Chung Wah Middle School, said: For the benefit of the country and the nation, the Communist Party has proactively extended a hand of friendship, and will not hold accountable past crimes committed by the Taiwan and overseas Kuomintang military and government personnel; when proposing negotiations with the Taiwan authorities on the peaceful liberation of Taiwan, no preconditions were put forward. If the Kuomintang also has the same sincerity and truly proceeds from the interests of the country and the nation, the peaceful liberation of Taiwan is entirely possible. He said: "As far as I know, the vast majority of Kuomintang military and government personnel in Taiwan today are very unhappy in their work and life. Now that the country has pointed out a bright path for them, it is time to turn back."

    Huang Jianli, the principal of Han Wah Middle School, said that Premier Zhou's statement on behalf of the government is a hope to unite all patriotic Chinese in one big family and jointly build a prosperous and strong motherland. He believes that all patriotic Chinese, including patriotic Taiwan and overseas Kuomintang military and government personnel, will welcome the peaceful liberation of Taiwan. Huang Qian, the principal of Fujian Middle School, also said that the Kuomintang military and government personnel in Taiwan should understand that they only have one future, which is to perform meritorious service in the cause of the peaceful liberation of Taiwan.

    Film director Cheng Bugao said: Taiwan is a part of China, and the compatriots in Taiwan all love the motherland. He hopes that the Taiwan authorities will accept peaceful liberation so that the Taiwan compatriots can fulfill their wishes and return to the embrace of the motherland.

    香港文化界人士希望台湾当局接受和平解放
    新华社广州10日电　香港一些著名的文化界人士最近纷纷向香港报界表示，希望台湾当局接受和平解放，早日回到祖国的怀抱。
    香港大学教授马鉴希望政府和台湾当局之间关于和平解放台湾的谈判能够真正实现。他说：“有什么事情不能通过协商解决的？何况大家都是自己人，坐下来商谈总比打好得多。”
    香港中华中学校长黄祖芬说：为了国家民族的利益，共产党主动地伸出友谊之手，对过去犯过罪恶的台湾和海外国民党军政人员既往不究；在提出和台湾当局谈判和平解放台湾时，又没有提出先决条件。如果国民党也具有同样诚意，真正从国家民族利益出发，和平解放台湾是完全可能的。他说：“据我所知，今天在台湾的绝大部分国民党军政人员在工作上和生活上都是很不愉快的，现在国家为他们指出一条光明的道路，该是回头是岸的时候了。”
    汉华中学校长黄建立说，周总理代表政府所作的表示是希望把一切爱国的中国人团结在一个大家庭里，共同建设自己繁荣、富强的祖国。他相信所有爱国的中国人、包括爱国的台湾和海外国民党军政人员都会欢迎和平解放台湾。福建中学校长黄潜也说，在台湾的国民党军政人员应该明白，他们只有一个前途，就是在和平解放台湾的事业中立功。
    电影导演程步高说：台湾是中国的一部分，台湾的同胞都是爱祖国的。希望台湾当局接受和平解放，使台湾同胞能如愿地归回祖国的怀抱。
