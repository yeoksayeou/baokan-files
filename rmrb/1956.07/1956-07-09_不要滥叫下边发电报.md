    Don't Abuse Telegrams to Lower Levels

    The Business Office of the Maritime Transport Bureau of the Ministry of Communications recently instructed the Ningbo Port Authority to telegraph the office and the Business Section of the Shanghai Maritime Transport Bureau every five days about the cargo completion status of the Yong-Shen line passenger freighters. As a result, the Ningbo Port Authority has to send twelve more telegrams each month, costing more than one hundred yuan. This is a completely unnecessary expense. According to existing regulations, when a freighter leaves Ningbo, it must telegraph the Maritime Transport Bureau and the Dispatch Office of the Shanghai Maritime Transport Bureau with the tonnage of cargo carried. They can completely synthesize these figures to statistically determine the cargo plan completion status of this route, and they have always done so in the past.

    The maritime transport departments all have their own radio stations, and sending telegrams does not require paying outside fees. Therefore, the phenomenon of abusing telegrams is relatively serious. It is hoped that this wasteful phenomenon can be overcome in the future.

    不要滥叫下边发电报
    交通部海运总局业务处，最近指示宁波港务局每五天分别向该处和上海海运局商务科，电告甬申线客班轮完成运货任务的情况。宁波港务局因此每月要多发十二份电报，多开支一百多元。这完全是不必要的开支。按照早有的规定：班轮在离开宁波时，一定要向海运总局和上海海运局调度室电告所载货物的吨数。他们完全可以综合这些数字统计出这条航线完成货运计划的情况，而且过去也一直是这样做的。
    海运部门都设有自己的电台，发电报不向外付钱，因而滥发电报的现象比较严重，希望今后能够克服这种浪费现象。
