Xinhua News Agency, Rome, 25th - According to a Paris dispatch published in "National Evening News," American sources say that after American labor leader Irving Brown was expelled from Algeria in May this year for activities in North Africa that violated French interests, his mission has been transferred to representatives of American industrial companies in Algeria.

The dispatch said that the representatives of the so-called American companies mainly refer to representatives of the American "California Texas Oil Corporation," which began exploring for oil in Algeria in 1953. Two employees of this company have repeatedly carried out various "delicate" foreign missions according to the instructions of the U.S. foreign policy leadership.

The dispatch said: "Their task is to establish contact with Algerian nationalists and incite them to demand that the United States come forward to 'mediate'."

    美国在阿尔及利亚进行反法活动
    新华社26日讯　据塔斯社罗马二十五日讯：“国家晚报”刊登的一篇巴黎通讯写道，据美国人士说，美国工会领袖欧文·布朗因为在北非进行违反法国利益的活动在今年五月被法国逐出阿尔及利亚以后，他的使命已经转交给美国在阿尔及利亚的工业公司的代表。
    这篇通讯说，所谓美国公司的代表，主要是指美国“加利福尼亚美孚油公司”的代表，这家公司1953年开始在阿尔及利亚勘探石油。这家公司有两个职员多次按照美国外交政策领导机构的指示执行了各种“微妙”的国外使命。
    通讯说：“他们的任务在于同阿尔及利亚的民族主义分子建立接触，怂恿民族主义分子要求美国出面‘调停’。”
