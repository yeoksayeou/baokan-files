Solving the Difficulties of Small Shops Household by Household
Zhang Wei

This spring, more than 80 small shops in Wuhan City engaged in the clock, knife and scissor, sewing machine, and general merchandise industries generally experienced operational difficulties and found it hard to make a living. After the Wuhan Municipal Company of China National General Merchandise Corporation arranged assistance household by household, the business situation of these small shops has improved, and the shop owners' living difficulties have also been resolved accordingly.

The main reasons for the difficulties faced by these small shops were a shortage of funds and heavy family burdens. Some shops had goods, but business was slow because of the presence of large stores nearby. Some experienced declining business due to the shift of prosperous markets or the interruption of old supply and marketing relationships. In addition, after the spring, winter goods were replaced with spring and summer goods, and the unit price was not as high as that of winter goods, which also reduced turnover.

In the spirit of overall planning for the entire industry, the Wuhan Municipal General Merchandise Company carefully calculated the monthly turnover required for each household to continue operating and maintain the family's livelihood. Without affecting residents' convenience in purchasing goods, appropriate arrangements were made based on the specific circumstances of each small shop. For those small shops that were experiencing operating difficulties due to a shortage of funds, but whose business locations were still suitable, the company provided them with a portion of goods on credit for consignment sales, collecting commissions, or requesting banks to expand their loans. Some small shops had only limited funds, and their business locations were adjacent to large joint state-private stores in the same industry. If their business was not directly related to the people's daily lives, the company adopted a "large leading small" approach, merging these small shops into larger stores. For some small shops with unsuitable business locations, the company closed the supply point and absorbed the labor force into state-owned companies or large joint state-private stores. Some small shops were located in relatively remote areas, but in order to facilitate the purchase of goods by surrounding residents, the company retained the supply point, while absorbing the surplus labor force into state-owned companies or large joint state-private stores to reduce the shops' expenses and facilitate their continued operation. For a small number of small shops with no prospects for development (such as small wholesalers and peddlers), the company arranged appropriate jobs for those with labor power; those without labor power and no other income were provided with social relief.

In addition to the above measures to assist small shops facing difficulties, the Wuhan Municipal General Merchandise Company also provided assistance in terms of the types of goods they could sell, such as allocating some fast-selling goods to small shops. At the same time, the company appropriately increased the price difference between wholesale and retail for some commodities to increase their profit income.

In addition, the department store companies in various districts also organized nearby small shops into several mutual aid groups to help each other, solving the problem of having few staff members and delays in business due to tasks such as purchasing goods, paying taxes, and repaying loans.

While assisting small shops, the company also helped them establish simple business systems and educated them to improve their service attitudes.

Yuantong Children's Clothing Store is one of many stores that have received assistance and whose business situation has greatly improved. Yuantong Children's Clothing Store is a small, inconspicuous store with a narrow storefront. This small store has always been run by Xu Xueqin, a woman who supports a family of eight. She had no capital and used to rely entirely on purchasing several yuan to dozens of yuan worth of children's clothing and toothbrushes from handicraft workshops on credit, with a daily turnover of only about 20 yuan, and sometimes no sales at all. The family could not make a living, and the children had to pick up vegetables in the market or sell clothes, and owed more than 300 yuan in debt. In April of this year, the Wuhan Municipal General Merchandise Company sent people to investigate the situation of Yuantong Children's Clothing Store and calculated that they needed a turnover of more than 700 yuan per month to cover all the expenses of the family and the store. In mid-May, the Wuhan Municipal General Merchandise Company provided them with goods worth 200 yuan for consignment sales based on the needs of Yuantong Children's Clothing Store, and also helped them obtain a loan of 300 yuan from the bank. Now, Yuantong Children's Clothing Store looks like a real store: the three small glass cabinets are full of goods, and the variety is relatively complete. The daily average sales are more than 60 yuan. On Children's Day, June 1, the store sold more than 100 yuan. In May, Yuantong Children's Clothing Store had a surplus of more than 100 yuan after all expenses. The shop owner, Xu Xueqin, repaid the bank loan ahead of schedule. Recently, she also plans to borrow another counter to add wooden slippers, fans, handbags and other items needed by people in summer.

Now, department store companies in various districts of Wuhan City have established a system of segmented, household-specific personnel responsibility, so that there are always dedicated personnel to help small shops with their transformation and to help them solve problems in business, supply of goods, and living conditions at any time.

    逐户解决小商店的困难
    张碨
    今年春季，武汉市钟表、刀剪、缝纫机、百货等十个行业的八十多家小商店，曾经普遍发生经营上的困难，生活难以维持。经过中国百货公司武汉市公司的逐户安排，现在这些小商店的营业情况已经好转，店主生活上的困难跟着也就解决了。
    这些小商店发生困难的主要原因是资金短少，家庭负担重。有的小店虽然有货，但因为附近有大商店，生意也很清淡。有的因为繁华市场转移，或老的供销关系中断，营业情况下降，再加上入春以后，冬季货物换成了春夏季的货物，单价不如冬令货值钱，这样营业额也就随之减少。
    武汉市百货公司根据全行业统筹安排的精神，认真地计算每户每月要有多少营业额才能继续经营和维持一家人的生活。并且在不影响居民购买方便的情况下，根据每户小商店的具体情况进行了妥善安排。对那些因为资金短少，经营发生困难，但营业的地点还合适的小商店，便赊给他们一部分货物让他们代销，领取手续费或者要求银行扩大对他们的贷款。有些小商店只有少数资金，营业地点又和同业的公私合营大店邻近，经营的业务也不同人民日常生活有直接关系，百货公司便采取以大带小的办法，把这些小店分别并到大店去。一些营业地点不适合的小商店，百货公司就撤去这个供应点，把店里的劳动力分别吸收到国营公司或公私合营大店里工作。有的小商店虽然营业地点比较偏僻，但是为了照顾周围居民购买东西的方便，百货公司便保留了这个供应点，而把店里多余的劳动力吸收到国营公司或公私合营大店去工作，以减少店里的开支，便于他们维持经营。少数无发展前途的小店（如小批发商和行商），有劳动力的，百货公司就给他们安排适当的工作；无劳动力而又无其他收入的，给以社会救济。
    武汉市百货公司除了采取以上各种办法先后安排了有困难的小商店外，在经营品种上也给以照顾，如把一些适销货让给小商店经营，同时对他们还适当扩大了一些商品的批发和零售之间的差价，以增加他们的利润收入。
    另外，百货公司各区商店还把靠近的小商店组织成若干互助小组来互相帮助，解决他们人手少，因进货、交税、还贷款等工作而耽误营业的问题。
    在安排小店的同时，还帮助这些小商店建立了简单的业务制度和教育他们改善服务态度等等。
    源通童装店就是这许多受到帮助营业情况大为好转的商店中的一家。源通童装店是一家门面狭窄，原来并不引人注意的小店。这家小店一向靠妇女许雪琴一人经营，养活老小八口人。她没有一个本钱，过去全靠向手工作坊赊几元到几十元的童装、牙刷等来周转，一天只能卖二十来元，有时整天不开张。一家人生活维持不了，小孩便到菜场拣菜吃，或者变卖衣物，还欠了三百多元债。今年四月份，武汉市百货公司派人调查了源通童装店里的情况，计算了他们每个月连家带店的一切开支需要有七百元以上的营业额才够维持。五月中旬，武汉市百货公司便根据源通童装店的需要，给了他们价值二百元的货物代销，又帮助他们在银行贷款三百元。现在，源通童装店很像个样子了：三个小玻璃柜里货物摆得满满的，货色也比较齐全，每天平均可以卖六十元以上。六月一日儿童节那天，就卖了一百多元。五月份源通童装店除了一切开支外，还有一百多元的盈余。店主许雪琴提前归还了银行的贷款。最近，她还准备再借一个货柜，添置些人们在夏季需要的木拖鞋、扇子、提包等。
    现在，武汉市百货公司各区商店都建立了分段分户专人负责制，以便经常有专人帮助小商店进行改造，并且随时帮助他们解决经营、货源和生活等方面的问题。
