A Weak Link in Modern Chinese History Research
Yan Zhongping, Deputy Director of the Institute of Economics, Chinese Academy of Sciences

Not long ago, the Party issued a call to scientists across the country to march towards science, and recently the Party proposed the policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend." We believe that under the correct leadership of the Party, a high tide of cultural construction in China will soon arrive, and Chinese scientists will make brilliant contributions to the world's treasure trove of science.

It should be clearly recognized that the cultural high tide we are facing is essentially different from those in the Spring and Autumn Period, the Greek era, and the Renaissance. The difference lies not only in the fact that our "hundred schools" embrace the common ideal of building socialism, nor only in the fact that we receive the correct leadership and meticulous care of the Party and the government, but also in the fact that our scientific workers, with the spirit of socialism and collectivism, examine the laws of scientific development and consciously and systematically devote themselves to this movement, contributing their personal labor to promote the all-round development of science. This is something that scholars in ancient countries could not have imagined, and that scholars in modern capitalist countries cannot imagine either.

The levels already reached by various sciences in China are very inconsistent. In some departments, we already have outstanding scientists who have reached the world's advanced level, while in other departments, the foundation is still very weak, or even completely blank. This situation stipulates that the planned development of various sciences in China at the present stage requires different focuses for different disciplines. Some of the more advanced disciplines already have the possibility of concentrating their efforts to solve key issues for further improvement, while other blank or weak disciplines need to vigorously engage in foundational work.

At this stage, the discipline of modern Chinese national economic history has a very weak foundation. The focus of work in the near future should seemingly be placed on the collection, organization, compilation, and publication of historical materials.

Regarding the semi-feudal and semi-colonial nature of modern China's social and economic structure, the Party's documents and Chairman Mao's works have already made principled scientific stipulations. Before liberation, some advanced writers also made outline descriptions of the historical development in this regard. These outline descriptions by advanced writers, on the eve of today's cultural high tide, are far from enough to meet the increasingly broad and urgent needs. It is regrettable that the research work in this area has progressed very slowly in the seven years since liberation, making the discipline of modern Chinese economic history a very weak link in the field of modern Chinese history.

In February of this year, we conducted a statistical analysis of economic science works published in the six years since liberation, and the results showed that among nearly three thousand specialized books and journal articles, only thirty were titled with Chinese economic history, and the modern economic history part accounted for only a small proportion of these thirty. This statistic is not comprehensive, but it is enough to show how much labor China's social scientists have spent on the study of modern Chinese economic history during this period. Progress like this is clearly not considered rapid.

Due to the small accumulation before liberation and the slow progress after liberation, the discipline of modern Chinese economic history is currently in this state: not only are scientific research results scarce, but even relatively systematic reference materials are also in short supply. Until now, when we talk about the economic aggression of foreign capitalism against China, we often still cannot do without the absurd works of imperialist apologists such as Morse and Remer, searching for historical clues and quoting materials from them, and sometimes the views are unconsciously poisoned by them. When we talk about the changes in China's feudal economy after the Opium War, we sometimes emphasize its disintegration in order to explain the development of capitalism, and sometimes we emphasize the remaining forces in order to explain feudal exploitation. We still lack concrete and comprehensive research on how to disintegrate and how to maintain the dialectical process of remnants. When we talk about the land problem, it is always about annexation and concentration, but people do not clearly understand the difference between the concentration in the 20th century and the concentration in the 19th century, nor do they clearly understand the changes in the nature of land ownership. As for the fact that there also exists a decentralization process within the landlord class, it attracts even less attention. Our understanding of the national bourgeoisie still floats on concepts such as duality and weakness, without making a concrete and in-depth analysis of its occurrence, development process, its connection and mutual contradiction with imperialism and feudalism. We have not even produced relatively comprehensive scientific research results on the process of the emergence, growth, and strengthening of the Chinese working class, and on the history of their labor, life, and struggle. On the other hand, the reactionary government and bourgeois scholars of old China did not leave behind economic statistics that met the minimum requirements. To this day, we still cannot know exactly how many people there were in old China, how much arable land there was, what the output and value of industry and agriculture were, how domestic goods circulated, not to mention the detailed, in-depth, and accurate figures for many other issues.

However, it must not be forgotten that "the mode of production in material life determines the general character of the social, political and spiritual processes of life." (Preface to A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy) Therefore, economic history, which is responsible for studying the economic base, has become a basic discipline that cannot be ignored by political history, military history, cultural history, and other specialized histories, as well as general histories. We see that when Chairman Mao analyzed the objects, tasks, motivations, and nature of the Chinese revolution, when distinguishing who were our enemies and who were our friends, he often started from studying the economic status of various classes in Chinese society and their interrelationships in production – the relations of production. When Chairman Mao called on us to study the economic, political, military, cultural and other issues of China's history and reality, he often put the economy first. It is unimaginable that a Marxist social scientist can make a comprehensive and profound research result on the superstructure by ignoring the analysis of the economic base.

In fact, the above-mentioned backward state of modern Chinese economic history research, its becoming a weak link in the study of various historical issues of modern Chinese society, has brought great difficulties to a series of research works. Since liberation, there have been quite a few works on many historical issues of modern Chinese society, especially the study of the history of peasant uprisings, which has been discussed the most. However, these works often lack rich materials for the analysis of the economic base, which appears weak and powerless. For example, during the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, the Nian Army, the Islamic ethnic groups, and the Boxer Rebellion, the specific situation of class differentiation in various regions has not yet been systematically studied. People often simply attribute the reasons for the failure of these movements to the lack of proletarian leadership. In fact, this general explanation of the lack of proletarian leadership can be applied to any peasant uprising in history. Using such an explanation to replace the specific analysis of the causes of the failure of each uprising will naturally easily ignore the study of the characteristics of each uprising. For example, the descriptions of the Reform Movement of 1898 and the Revolution of 1911 are also mostly limited to the ideological and political activities of individuals and parties, and rarely analyze the economic situation of the society at that time. The most common phenomenon is that when people discuss the development of Chinese national capital, the growth of the working class, and the May Fourth Movement during the First World War, most of them use yarn spindle statistics to elaborate their arguments, but not only do the figures used by many writers differ from each other, but also different figures appear in the different works of the same writer; even in the same book, two quotations also have two different figures! We might exaggerate a little and say that the current stage of research on modern Chinese social and historical issues has reached such a juncture that without strengthening the weak link of economic history, other specialized histories and general histories will be difficult to advance deeply.

The above-mentioned backward state of modern economic history research has also brought great difficulties to teaching work. There have never been many workers who specialize in modern Chinese economic history. At present, there are only about thirty teaching staff in Chinese economic history above the associate professor level in the country, and those who specialize in modern economic history are a minority of these thirty. According to regulations, the political economy departments of comprehensive universities and certain majors of financial and economic colleges should teach economic history, or general Chinese economic history, or general Chinese and foreign economic history. Foreign ones can be taught later, but Chinese ones cannot be taught later; ancient ones can be taught later, but modern ones cannot be taught later. Needless to say, it is very difficult for a few people to cover everything, both Chinese and foreign, ancient and modern. Even teaching modern Chinese economic history alone is a very heavy task. Because the research results of modern Chinese economic history in the past were so scarce that lecturers had to start from scratch in almost everything. So, finding materials and writing lectures, from scratch, it was really too busy, but the result was still not necessarily able to be taught comprehensively and deeply. This situation shows that the current backward state of modern Chinese economic history research is seriously hindering the growth of the next generation.

The problem is not only the lack of past achievements, the lack of current experts, and the difficulties caused by these two shortages to scientific research and teaching work, but also the fact that people do not seem to have fully recognized the seriousness of the problem, and therefore have not shown a significant tendency to reverse the situation in their work. It is reported that among the approximately 950 scientific research topics in the political economy (including economic history) and finance and economics majors of nearly 150 universities and colleges across the country this year, only 24 are related to Chinese economic history, accounting for about 2.5% of the total number of research topics, and only 20 fall within the scope of modern economic history, accounting for about 2%. Among the 420 research topics in Chinese history in the above-mentioned universities, only 83 can be included in the scope of Chinese economic history, accounting for about 19.8%, while only 19 fall within the scope of modern economic history, accounting for about 4.5%. As for the specialized editing of economic history materials, there is only one topic, accounting for one in 1,374 of the topics in the two categories of economics and history! The research topics of units of the Academy of Sciences and national administrative agencies and enterprises have not yet been counted, but at present, most of the research force is distributed in universities and colleges. This estimate of scientific research topics in universities and colleges can indicate the general research direction of Chinese economists, historians, and economic historians in the near future. We believe that it is worth discussing whether it is appropriate to allocate research forces in this way in the work of reality and history, ancient (including medieval) and modern, superstructure and economic base, writing monographs and compiling materials. If, on average, the number of research topics can represent the amount of labor, then economists, historians, and economic historians only devote one in 1,374 of their labor to compiling materials, which is clearly far from meeting the needs of teaching and scientific research.

Historians must master a large amount of data before they can write, which everyone knows; but the fact that historical science must unearth a large amount of data before it can prosper is often overlooked. In ancient times and modern capitalist countries, the progress of historiography relied on historians individually and spontaneously unearthing data, analyzing and researching, and slowly advancing. These historians had no common ideals, could not talk about division of labor and cooperation, and they were blindly advancing under the control of the objective laws of scientific development. Now that we are examining the laws of scientific development with the spirit of socialism and collectivism, and consciously and systematically contributing individual labor to promote the all-round development of a science, then what are our current main tasks? We believe that the current difficulty in the discipline of modern Chinese economic history lies in the shortage of data. Due to the data shortage, people with more research experience feel that they have no place to use their talents, and people who need to learn research work lack spiritual food, so this discipline is in a paralyzed state and difficult to advance rapidly. Therefore, we believe that the urgent task is to vigorously collect, organize, and compile data, first solve the data shortage, popularize basic knowledge, and seek improvement from popularization.

What we call collecting, organizing, and compiling data includes the work of sifting out useful records from a large number of documents, systematically organizing and compiling them, as well as the work of compiling and printing certain archives, manuscripts, and translating certain foreign language documents. Modern Chinese economic history materials are almost everywhere and readily available. Among publications, collections of essays, magazines, local chronicles, newspapers, etc. contain materials; among archival documents, government files of the old regime, account books of Chinese and foreign private enterprises also contain materials. Any worker in any place can combine their specific circumstances, use local materials, and compile useful materials. Small from sorting out statistics on wages, prices, and silver prices based on the account books of old shops, large to compiling materials on the historical development of a company, an industry, a department, a region, or even the whole country for several years, several decades, or a hundred years, are all possible. It is said that an old professor in Shanghai is leading a group to sort out the files and account books of the Shenxin Company. This is very welcome work. We expect that their work will provide very valuable reference materials for the occurrence and development process of Chinese national capital.

The work of compiling modern Chinese economic history materials is of course the task of professional workers in modern Chinese economic history. But this is not necessarily not the task of economists and historians. Since political economy is a historical science, and Chinese political economists need to combine the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism with China's reality, it is naturally necessary for Chinese economists to study China's economic development history. On the other hand, it is also unimaginable for Marxist-Leninist historians to completely abandon the study of the economic base. In fact, today most of those who teach economic history in universities and colleges have also transferred from the two disciplines of political economy and Chinese history. At present, the professional team in this area is not strong enough, and the potential force engaged in this work in the political economy and Chinese history fields of universities and colleges is still quite rich.

We believe that the current method of each university acting on its own, fighting in isolation, and contracting the entire set of materials and lectures needs to be changed. We suggest concentrating a part of the teaching staff in universities and colleges to compile general lectures on modern Chinese economic history for distribution and application in various schools. In this way, it is possible for each region to take the economic history teaching staff of each school as the center, unite economists and historians inside and outside the school to form a working group, and concentrate on the collection and compilation of materials on certain special topics. By doing so, we can solve the current difficulties relatively quickly and effectively.

It should be explained that we have no intention of opposing the compilation of materials and the writing of monographs. We believe that experts' research monographs will play a guiding role in the work of materials, and material workers also have the obligation to put forward their own understanding and views on the issues. We also advocate that textbooks should be compiled in various ways, and there is no need to be fixed on one. However, the current specific needs have priorities and urgency, the development of various sciences has procedures and laws, so the overall work deployment should also have steps and priorities. We believe that the main problem of our discipline at present is not to pursue improvement, but to popularize basic knowledge, from nothing to something. Without general lectures, teachers cannot even catch their breath, where else can there be energy to contend? Without rich materials, writers also have nothing to contend. In order to realize the contention of a hundred schools of thought, we need to prepare conditions for contention. As for writers who have already mastered a large amount of data and have a well-thought-out plan, it is of course possible and necessary to sing loudly.

Fifteen years ago, Chairman Mao called on us to "gather talents, divide labor and cooperate to do the history of China in the past hundred years, and overcome the state of disorganization." Today should be the time for us to realize this call.

    中国近代史研究上的一个薄弱环节
    中国科学院经济研究所副所长　严中平
    不久以前，党向全国科学工作者发出了向科学进军的号召，最近党又提出了“百家争鸣”的方针。我们相信，在党的正确领导之下，中国的文化建设高潮，不久即将到来，中国的科学工作者即将对世界科学宝库作出辉煌的贡献。
    应该明确地认识，我们所面临的文化高潮，和春秋战国时代、希腊时代、文艺复兴时代的那些景象是有其本质上的区别的。区别不仅仅在于我们的“百家”抱着建设社会主义的共同理想，也不仅仅在于我们受到党和政府的正确领导和无微不至的关怀，而且在于我们的科学工作者是以社会主义、集体主义的精神，审察科学的发展规律，自觉地、有计划地投身于这个运动，为推进科学的全面发展而贡献个人的劳力的。这一点，是古代各国学者所不曾想像到的，也是现代资本主义国家的学者所不能想像到的。
    目前中国各门科学所已经达到的水平是很不一致的，有些部门，我们已经拥有达到世界先进水平的杰出的科学家，另一些部门，基础还十分薄弱，甚至根本就是空白的。这个情况规定当前中国各门科学的有计划的发展，需要对不同的学科，安排不同的重点工作。某些比较先进的学科，已经有可能集中力量去解决进一步提高的关键性问题，另一些空白或薄弱的学科，则需要大力从事基础性的工作。
    现阶段中国近代国民经济史这门学科，基础十分薄弱。最近将来的工作重点，似乎应该放在史料的收集、整理、编纂和印行上。
    关于近代中国社会经济结构之半封建半殖民地的性质，党的文件和毛主席的著作早已作了原则性的科学规定，解放前若干先进作家对这方面的历史发展情况也作过轮廓性的描述。这些先进作家的轮廓性的描写，到了文化高潮前夕的今天，是远远地不够满足日益广泛而迫切的需要了。遗憾的是，解放七年以来，这方面的研究工作进展得非常迟缓，竟使中国近代经济史这一学科成为中国近代史领域内一个非常薄弱的环节。
    今年二月，我们曾经对解放后六年多的经济科学方面的论著做过一次统计，结果得知在将近三千种专书和期刊论文中，以中国经济史为题者只有三十种，而近代经济史部分又在这三十种里占一个不大的比例。这个统计不够全面，不过这已经很够表明，在这期间，中国的社会科学工作者在中国近代经济史的研究上大致已花费了多少劳力。像这样的进展，显然不能算是迅速的。
    由于解放前积累之少，解放后进展之慢，目前中国近代经济史这一学科就处在这样的状态之下：不独科学研究成果显得贫乏，就是比较系统的参考资料也感到饥荒。到目前为止，当我们谈到外国资本主义对中国的经济侵略时，我们常常还离不开帝国主义辩护士如马士、雷穆之流的荒谬著作，从其中找寻历史线索，转引资料，有时观点亦受其毒害而不自觉；当我们谈到鸦片战争后中国封建经济的变化时，时而为了说明资本主义的发展而强调其解体的一面，时而又为了说明封建剥削而强调其残余势力的一面，对于怎样解体，怎样保持残留的辩证过程，至今还缺少具体的全面的研究；当我们谈到土地问题时，则无时无地不在兼并集中，但是人们不明确二十世纪的集中和十九世纪的集中有何差别，也不明确土地所有权的性质有何变动，至于在地主阶级内部也还存在分散过程，就更加很少引人注意了；我们对于民族资产阶级的认识，还浮游在两重性、软弱性之类概念上，而没有对它的发生、发展过程，对它和帝国主义、封建主义的联系和相互矛盾作出具体深入的分析；我们甚至对于中国工人阶级发生、成长、壮大的过程，对于他们劳动、生活、斗争的历史，也还没有做出比较全面的科学研究成果来。另一方面，旧中国反动政府和资产阶级学者又是没有留下合乎起码要求的经济统计资料的，到如今，我们还不能确切知道旧中国人口多少、耕地多大、工、农各业的产量、产值如何、国内商品的流转情况如何，更不用说其他许多问题的细致深入的精确数字了。
    但是，不能忘记，“物质生活底生产方式决定着社会生活、政治生活以及一般精神生活的过程。”（政治经济学批判序言）因此，以研究经济基础为职责的经济史这一学科就成为政治史、军事史、文化史等等专史以及通史所不可忽略的基础学科。我们看到毛主席在分析中国革命的对象、任务、动力、性质等等问题时，在分辨谁是我们的敌人，谁是我们的朋友时，经常是从研究中国社会各阶级的经济地位、从他们在生产中的相互关系——生产关系入手的。毛主席在号召我们对中国历史上的、现实的经济、政治、军事、文化等各项问题进行研究时，也常常是把经济列为首位的。不能想像，一个马克思主义社会科学工作者忽略了对于经济基础的分析，能够对上层建筑做出全面深刻的研究成果来。
    事实上，中国近代经济史研究工作的上述落后状态，它之成为近代中国社会各项历史问题研究上的薄弱环节，已经给一系列的研究工作带来了很大的困难。解放以后，关于近代中国社会许多历史问题的著作，不能算太少，特别是农民起义史的研究，论述最多。但是这些著作对于经济基础的分析，往往缺乏丰富的资料，显得软弱无力。例如，太平天国、捻军、伊斯兰各族、义和团诸大起义时，各地区阶级分化的具体情况如何，就还没有系统的研究。人们常常把这些运动的失败原因简单地归之于没有无产阶级的领导，其实没有无产阶级领导这个一般性的说明是可以适用到历史上任何一次农民起义的。用这样的说明来代替对于历次起义失败原因的具体分析，自然就容易忽略了对于各次起义特点的研究。又如关于维新运动、辛亥革命的描述，也还多限于个人的、党派的思想活动、政治活动，很少分析当时社会的经济情况；最常见的现象是，当人们讨论到第一次世界大战时期中国民族资本的发展、工人阶级的壮大、以及五四运动等等问题时，多半要拿纱绽统计来阐述自己的论点，但是不仅许多作家所用的数字互相纷歧，莫衷一是；就在同一作家的不同著作里，也出现了不同的数字；甚至同一本书里，两处引用，也就有了两个不同的数字！我们不妨夸大一点这样说，现阶段中国近代社会历史问题的研究已经走到了这样的关口，不加强经济史这一薄弱环节，其他专史和通史都很难深入前进了。
    近代经济史研究工作的上述落后状态又给教学工作带来了极大的困难。从来专攻中国近代经济史的工作者就是不多的。目前副教授以上的中国经济史教学人员全国不过三十人左右，而专攻近代经济史者又是这三十人中的少数。按规定，综合大学政治经济学系和财经学院的某些专业都应讲授经济史，或中国经济通史，或中外经济通史。外国的或可缓教，中国的不能缓教；古代的或可缓教，近代的不能缓教。不用说，以少数人包办中外古今是很困难的，就是专教中国近代经济史，也是一件很吃重的任务。因为过去中国近代经济史的研究成果是这样的贫乏，以致讲课人几乎样样都要从头做起，于是找资料，写讲稿，从无到有，真是忙得不可开交，而结果还是未必能讲得全面、深入。这种情况表明，当前中国近代经济史研究的落后状态正严重地阻碍下一代的成长。
    问题还不仅仅在于过去成就之少，目前专家之少，以及这二少对科学研究工作和教学工作所造成的困难，而且在于人们似乎还没有充分认识到问题的严重性，因而在工作上还没有表现出扭转局面的显著倾向。据悉全国将近一百五十所高等院校政治经济学（包括经济史）、财经各专业，今年度的科学研究题目共约九百五十多个，其中有关中国经济史者仅二十四个，约占研究总数的2.5％，属于近代经济史范围的凡二十个，约占2％，又上述院校中国历史方面的研究题目共四百二十个，其中可以列入中国经济史范围的凡八十三个，约占19.8％，而属于近代经济史范围者则又只十九个，约占4.5％。至于专门编辑经济史资料的，只有一个题目，占经济、历史两类题目的一千三百七十四分之一！科学院各单位和国家行政机构、企业机构的研究题目尚无统计，不过目前大部分研究力量分布在高等院校，高等院校科学研究题目的这项估计，是可以表明最近将来中国的经济学家、历史学家、经济史工作者大致的研究方向的。我们认为在现实和历史、古代（包括中世）和近代，上层建筑和经济基础，撰述论著和编纂资料这些工作上，像这样去配备研究力量是否恰当，是一个很值得商讨的问题。如果平均说来，研究题目的数字就可以代表劳动量，那么，经济学家、历史学家和经济史工作者就只拿出一千三百七十四分之一的劳力来编纂资料，这显然是远远不能适应教学和科学研究的需要的。
    历史学家必须掌握大量资料才能执笔创作，这是人人都知道的；可是历史科学必须发掘大量资料才能昌盛，这一点却往往被人忽略了。在古代以及近代资本主义国家，史学的进步是依靠历史学家个别地、自发地发掘资料，分析研究而缓缓前进的。这些历史学家没有共同的理想，谈不上分工和合作，他们是各自接受科学发展的客观规律的支配而盲目前进的。如今我们既然是抱着社会主义、集体主义的精神，审察科学的发展规律，自觉地、有计划地为推进一门科学的全面发展而贡献个人劳力的，那么我们当前的主要任务是什么呢？我们认为现阶段中国近代经济史这一学科的难关在于资料饥荒。由于资料饥荒，比较有研究经验的人就感到英雄无用武之地，正需要学习研究工作的人就缺乏精神食粮，从而这门学科也就处在瘫痪状态，难以迅速前进。因此，我们认为迫切的任务是大力收集、整理、编纂资料，首先解救资料饥荒，普及基本知识，从普及中求提高。
    我们所谓收集、整理、编纂资料，包括从大量文献中淘洗出有用的记载，系统地加以整理、编纂的工作，也包括编印某些档案、手稿，和翻译某些外文文献的工作。中国近代经济史资料几乎是随地皆有，俯拾即是的。出版品中，文集、杂志、方志、报纸等等藏有资料；档案文献中、旧政权的政府卷宗、中外私营企业的账册，也都藏有资料。任何地方的任何一个工作者，都可以结合自己的具体情况，就地取材，编出有用的资料来。小自根据古老店铺的账册整理工资、物价、银价之类统计，大至综合书报档案编纂一公司、一行业、一部门、一地区乃至全国历史发展情况资料，或数年、或数十年、或百年，都无不可。听说上海某位老教授正在领导一个小组整理申新公司的卷宗账册，这就是非常值得欢迎的工作，我们预料他们的工作将会对中国民族资本的发生、发展过程做出很有价值的参考资料来。
    编纂中国近代经济史资料的工作，当然是中国近代经济史专业工作者的任务。不过这也未尝不是经济学家，历史学家的任务。政治经济学既然是一门历史科学，中国的政治经济学家既然需要把马克思列宁主义的普遍真理和中国的实际相结合，那么中国的经济学家研究中国的经济发展史自然就有必要。另一方面，马克思列宁主义的历史学家完全放开经济基础的研究，也是不可想像的。事实上，今天在高等院校进行经济史教学工作者，也以从政治经济学和中国历史两门学科里转业而来的占多数。目前这方面的专业队伍还不够强大，高等院校政治经济学和中国历史方面从事这方面工作的潜在力量还是相当丰富的。
    我们认为目前各院校各自为政、孤立作战、包办全套资料和讲稿的办法是需要改变的。我们建议，集中高等院校一部分教学人员来编纂中国近代经济史的通用讲义，分发各校应用。这样，各地就有可能以各校经济史教学人员为中心，联合校内外经济学家、历史学家组成工作小组，集中精力于某些专题资料的收集体、编纂工作。这样做，我们就有可能比较迅速有效地解决当前的困难。
    应该说明，我们无意于把编纂资料和撰述论著对立起来，我们认为专家的研究论著将对资料工作发生指导作用，资料工作者也有义务提出自己对于问题的理解和看法。我们也主张教科书应该编写多种，不必定于一尊。但是当前的具体需要有先后、有缓急，各门科学的发展有程序，有规律，因而全面的工作布置也就应该有步骤、有重点。我们认为目前我们这一学科的问题，主要的还不在追求提高，而在普及基本知识，从无到有。没有通用讲义，则教学者气都喘不过来，那里还有余力争鸣？没有丰富资料，著作家也是无所争其鸣的。为了实现百家争鸣，我们正需要为争鸣准备条件。至于已经掌握大量资料、胸有成竹的作家，当然是有可能也有必要引吭高歌的。
    十五年前毛主席就号召我们“对于近百年的中国史，应聚集人材，分工合作地去做，克服无组织的状态”了。今天应该是我们实现这个号召的时候了。
