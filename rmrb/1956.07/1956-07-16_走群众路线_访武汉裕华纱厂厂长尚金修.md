Following the Mass Line
——An Interview with Shang Jinxiu, Director of Wuhan Yuhua Cotton Mill——
By our reporter Cao Baoming

    One pouring rainy night, an unlatched window was banging loudly in the wind. In the reception room of the Wuhan Yuhua Cotton Mill, Director Shang Jinxiu answered our questions: How do factory leaders organize and lead the production upsurge?
    In late February, the factory held a conference of production technology representatives. In February, the standard product rate of cotton yarn was 54.13%, and in May it rose to 100%. In February, the rate of substandard cloth was 5.79%, and in May it dropped to 3.23%. In May, all other indicators were also completed. Recently, even superior quality 32-count yarn has appeared. The production technology representatives conference was the beginning of production improvement. Therefore, Director Shang began by talking about this event.

The Mass Line in Technical Work
    He said: "I only came to Yuhua last August and didn't understand the business. In the past, Yuhua's cotton consumption had been relatively low, but in September it rose to even higher than Zhenhuan Cotton Mill, which had poorer equipment. I had no way to deal with it and was very distressed.
    "When Minister Han of the Municipal Party Committee's Industry Department and Director Zheng of the Municipal Textile Management Bureau talked to me, they both said that Yuhua's chief and deputy engineers had technical solutions, and the heads of the finance, planning, labor and wages departments were familiar with the business. I should seize them, support them, and give full play to their enthusiasm to improve production.
    "I also analyzed it myself: Yuhua's management work originally had a relatively complete set of systems. Ye Kuisheng, the deputy director in charge of production and chief engineer, was very humble and willing to study hard; he was a model worker. Last year, he collected advanced experiences from various places and wrote a thick notebook. Therefore, he presided over many production technology tasks and meetings, and I participated. We consulted together on major issues in advance.
    "In the last five months of last year, we mainly solved the problem of cotton consumption. During this period, my most prominent feeling about the factory was: too many meetings, too many documents and reports, and a lack of mass base in production technology work. We were still developing technical measures plans as normal, and each key issue had corresponding technical measures. However, because the leaders were all trapped in meetings and documents and reports, many technical measures were not discussed with the masses before being proposed. The implementers below did not understand the significance of the measures and implemented them mechanically. There was also a lack of inspection and summarization during implementation, so many measures were not implemented. I shared my experience with the Party Committee Secretary and several deputy directors, and they all agreed. We later emphasized reducing meetings and documents and reports, going deep into reality, and strengthening the mass base of production technology work, but because of a lack of concrete measures, there was no effect.
    "At this time, the Wuhan Municipal Party Committee led us to study the experience of Daye Steel Plant in holding a conference of production technology representatives. I studied for a week. According to my understanding, the essence of the conference of production technology representatives is to implement the mass line in every link of the preparation, discussion, and implementation of technical measures. I was very excited at the time, thinking that I had found a way to implement the mass line in production technology work.
    "At this time, our factory was formulating a two-year plan. The masses were very enthusiastic and decided to implement the policy of the Ministry of Textile Industry to comprehensively complete the plan with the focus on improving quality, and to complete the first five-year plan one year ahead of schedule. The standard product rate of cotton yarn in the fourth quarter of last year was only 45.22%, and it was required to reach 90% from April 1st this year; the output per thousand spindles per hour in the fourth quarter was only 26.63 kilograms, and it was required to reach 28.07 kilograms in the first quarter of this year; the unit cost of 21-count yarn was also required to be reduced by 1.58 yuan in the first quarter. This required us to thoroughly improve our work in order to complete it. I naturally thought of the experience of Daye Steel Plant. After I reported this opinion to the Party Committee, the Party Committee held a special discussion and instructed us to immediately organize forces to find out the production situation, mobilize the masses to find key problems and formulate measures, and do a good job of preparation.
    "This meeting was very lively and solved problems. Everyone discussed the factory's 'three major problems', 'nine key points' and 150 items of the annual technical measures outline, clarifying the key production problems and solutions. They also made severe criticisms of the bureaucratic work style of our leaders. Cao Zhifu, the foreman of the fine spinning workshop, suggested modifying the periodic lifting and lowering position of the doffer plate, which could reduce yarn breakage by 30%, but because the funding for the measure was not resolved, this suggestion was delayed for more than a month. Ma Xiuying, the representative of the fine spinning workshop, challenged us at the meeting, saying: 'If the leaders are afraid of spending too much money, we are willing to take out our labor competition bonus to realize this rationalization proposal.' The enthusiasm of the workers in each workshop was also very high. They held a meeting in the afternoon to study the key problems and measures, and the next morning they took action. For example, the front spinning workshop studied the method of listening to the sound when grinding the machine, and they experimented with it the next morning. Later, it quickly reduced cotton knots and impurities. Similar new atmospheres appeared in the reeling workshop, the fine spinning workshop, the cloth yard, and even the mess hall.
    "After the meeting, each workshop further identified small key problems on the machines and weak links in individual operations around the key problems of the workshop, and formulated measures to further ensure that everyone knew what the key problems of the workshop were and in which direction to work hard.
    "It was through this conference of production technology representatives that the production enthusiasm of the masses was concentrated on the key production problems, and the mass line began to be implemented in production technology work, and production performance gradually increased."

Paying Old Debts
    "But this is only the beginning, and there are many problems that need to be solved specifically," he continued after a pause. "At this meeting, the masses criticized our leaders as 'four olds'—old problems, old reasons, old measures, and old unresolved issues. After the meeting, some people also said: 'The leaders have been very humble this time, but every time they have a meeting, they say very nice things. What will they actually do? We have to wait and see.' Based on this situation, the Party Committee required cadres at all levels to earnestly change their leadership style and go deep into their work. We decided to first deal with the accumulated old problems, and even gave it a name called 'Leaders Paying Old Debts'.
    "The method of 'Leaders Paying Old Debts' was that the chief engineer and I led the relevant section chiefs to the workshops to solve the old problems. Why must we go to the workshops to solve them? Because these old problems had been raised by the workshops many times in the past, but often the sections said 'unnecessary', and the factory director could not make a decision, so they were delayed again and again, some for one or two years without being solved. The workshops reflected: 'Come down and see for yourselves whether it should be solved or not.' This time, the three parties faced each other on the spot. The workshops raised the problems, and everyone decided whether it should be solved and when it should be solved, and they all wrote it down separately and supervised and checked it at any time. The front spinning workshop had repeatedly reported that the pressure of the middle hammer was inconsistent, which affected the quality of the cotton sliver, and requested to replace some parts, but because it cost more money, it was delayed for a year or so without being solved. This time, the workshop director Jin Hanchen led us to the machine to see: 'Do you think it should be replaced or not?' I didn't understand the technology, but after looking at the wear and tear of the drawing frame teeth, I also thought it should be replaced. The workshops raised a total of ninety-three questions to the factory director's office, only three of which required capital construction investment and could not be resolved temporarily. The remaining ninety questions were resolved in March and April.

Go Down More, Hold Fewer Meetings
    "At this time, we also rectified the production command system and the work system. One of the regulations was that cadres at the factory level must spend five hours a day directly handling and studying production problems, and only three hours a day attending meetings and reading documents. Cadres at the workshop level must spend six hours a day inspecting the production site and studying production problems, and only two hours a day studying documents and attending meetings.
    "You ask us what methods we used to reduce meetings and implement this system? We ranked the meetings and decided which meetings could be merged and which meetings could be reduced. For example, in the past there were three ten-day analysis meetings: quality analysis meetings, cotton consumption analysis meetings, and comprehensive plan completion analysis meetings. We had to hold nine ten-day analysis meetings a month. Now we combine them and only hold three times a month. Also, in the past, we held a production dynamics analysis meeting every morning to analyze weak links, and a daily production meeting in the afternoon to arrange technical measures, which made everyone busy attending meetings all day long. We changed it to once every three days. Because many specific problems were directly solved in the in-depth work, we could still solve problems by meeting once every three days.
    "We also changed the way we held meetings. In the past, the leaders always read reports for more than an hour, and said the problems very definitely in advance. Everyone had nothing to say, so they said a few words here and there, discussed it, and finally the leader summarized, and it was still the original opinion. The meeting took a long time and the quality was not high. Now we changed it to: before the meeting, we distribute a production statistics table to everyone. At the beginning of the meeting, each workshop talks about the reasons for completing or not completing the indicators and the solutions, and finally the leaders summarize everyone's opinions. This can not only shorten the time of each meeting, but also concentrate everyone's opinions, give play to everyone's enthusiasm, and truly play the role of the meeting.
    "We also emphasized holding professional meetings, and each meeting focused on studying and solving one problem. In this way, the problems were studied in depth and solved systematically.
    "After rectifying the management work, everyone's feedback was very good. The two chief engineers said: 'This has liberated us. We have time to go deep into the workshop, and we feel at ease in the workshop.' In the past, they also had more than an hour every morning to inspect production, but because there were many meetings, and some meetings had to be presided over by them, they often walked and looked at their watches, unable to inspect with peace of mind. Regarding the implementation of technical measures, they also asked the technicians: 'How is it going?' The technician said: 'Good.' That was it, they couldn't personally check it. After returning from the inspection, they had meetings, from morning to afternoon, from afternoon to after work, and there was no time to specifically study production problems. After this rectification, they went to the workshop with peace of mind, and even took a micrometer to personally measure the steel wire spacing, and personally picked up the wool stick to see if the machine was clean. The work of the sections also began to change the style of 'waiting for things to come'. The comrades of the testing section also creatively researched the 'quality quota tracking inspection system'. In the past, the testing section only knew which indicator of which workshop was not completed, but did not know why it was not completed. After establishing this system, once a quality problem was found, it was traced to the specific machine, specific parts, and individual operations, and the cause was found and corrected in time, which played a great role in improving product quality.

    走群众路线
    ——访武汉裕华纱厂厂长尚金修——
    本报记者　曹葆铭
    一个倾盆大雨的夜晚，没有扣牢的窗户被风吹得啪哒啪哒直响。在武汉市裕华纱厂的会客室里，尚金修厂长回答着我们提出的问题：工厂的领导人怎样组织和领导生产高潮？
    二月下旬，这个厂开过一次生产技术代表会议。二月份，这个厂的棉纱标准品率是54.13％，五月份便升到100％。二月份，次布率是5.79％，五月份便降到3.23％。五月份，其他指标也全部完成了。最近，32支纱还出现了上等优级品。生产技术代表会议是改进生产的开端。所以，尚厂长便从这件事谈起。
    技术工作的群众路线
    他说：“我是去年八月才调到裕华来的，不懂业务。过去裕华厂的用棉量一直是比较低的，九月份却上升到比附近设备较差的震寰纱厂还高。我一点办法没有，很苦恼。
    “市委工业部韩部长、市纺管局郑局长跟我谈话的时候，都说裕华的正副总工程师在技术上有办法，财务、计划、劳动工资科的几个科长业务很熟悉，要抓紧他们，支持他们，发挥他们的积极性，就有办法搞好生产。
    “我自己也分析了一番：裕华的管理工作原来就有一套比较完整的制度。生产副厂长兼总工程师叶奎声很虚心，肯钻研，是个劳动模范。他去年搜集各地先进经验，就写了一厚本札记。因此，生产技术上的许多工作和会议，都让他主持，我参加。重大问题事先共同商量。
      “在去年后五个月中，我们主要解决了用棉量问题。在这期间，我对工厂的最突出的感觉是：会议多，文件表报多，生产技术工作缺乏群众基础。我们编制技术措施计划还是很正常的，每个关键问题都有相应的技术措施。但是，因为领导人员都陷在会议和文件表报里了，许多技术措施在提出前没有同群众研究，提出后下面的执行人不了解措施的意义，机械执行；执行中又缺乏检查、总结，所以很多措施都没有贯彻。我把自己的体会跟党委书记谈过，也跟几个副厂长谈过，他们都同意。我们后来也强调要减少会议和文件表报，深入实际，加强生产技术工作的群众基础，但是因为缺乏具体办法，没有什么效果。
      “这时，武汉市委领着我们去学习大冶钢厂召开生产技术代表会议的经验。我去学习了一个星期。据我的理解，生产技术代表会议的实质，是要在编制、讨论和执行技术措施的每个环节上贯彻群众路线。我当时很兴奋：认为这下可找到在生产技术工作中贯彻群众路线的方法了。
      “这时，我们工厂正在制定两年规划。群众热情很高，决定要贯彻执行纺织部提出的以提高质量为重点全面完成计划的方针，提前一年完成第一个五年计划。我们去年第四季度的棉纱标准品率才45.22％，今年四月一日起就要求达到90％；第四季度的千锭时产量才26.63公斤，今年第一季度就要求达到28.07公斤；21支纱的单位成本也要求在第一季内降低一元五角八分钱。这都要求我们彻底改进工作，才能完成。我很自然地便联想到大冶钢厂的经验。我将这个意见向党委汇报后，党委专门讨论了一次，责成我们立即着手组织力量摸清生产情况，发动群众找关键、订措施，做好准备工作。
      “这次会议开得很热烈，也解决问题。大家对全厂生产上的‘三大问题’、‘九个关键’和150项全年技术措施大纲作了讨论，明确了生产关键问题和解决办法。对我们领导上的官僚主义作风，也提出了严厉的批评。细纱间工长曹志福建议改装叶子板定期升降位置，能减少断头30％，但是，因为措施经费没有解决，这个建议拖了一个多月还没实现。细纱间的代表马秀英就在会上将我们军说：‘如果领导上怕花钱多了，我们愿意拿出自己的劳动竞赛奖金来实现这个合理化建议。’各车间职工的劲头也很足，头天下午开会研究了关键和措施，第二天上午就行动起来。如前纺车间研究了磨车工作的听音响的工作法，第二天早上便试验，后来使棉结杂质迅速降低了。在摇纱车间、在细纱车间、在布场，甚至伙食团，都出现了类似的新气象。
    “会议以后，各车间又围绕本车间的关键问题，进一步找出机台上的小关键和个人操作的薄弱环节，订好措施办法，进一步做到人人晓得本车间的关键是什么，要从哪个方向去努力。
    “就是通过这次生产技术代表会议，将群众的生产热情集中到生产关键上了，开始在生产技术工作中贯彻群众路线，生产成绩也逐步上升。”
     还老债
      “不过这也只是开端，有很多问题还需要具体解决，”歇了一会，他继续说。“在这次会上，群众就批评我们领导上是‘四老’——老问题、老原因、老措施、老不解决。会后，也有人讲：‘领导上这次表现得挺虚心，不过每次开会都是说得很好听，到底作得怎样？还得看。’根据这个情况，党委要求各级干部切实转变领导作风，深入工作。我们决定首先处理积压的老问题，还给它取了个名儿叫‘领导还老债’。
    “‘领导还老债’的作法是由总工程师和我分别率领有关的科长下车间解决老问题。为什么一定要下车间去解决呢？因为这些老问题，车间过去提过多少次，往往科室说了句‘不需要’，厂长下不了决心，便一拖再拖，有的拖了一两年也没解决。车间反映：‘你们下来看看究竟该不该解决。’这次在现场上三家对面，车间提出问题来，大家决定该不该解决，何时解决，都分头记下来，随时督促检查。前纺车间过去一再反映中锤压力不一致，影响棉条质量，要求换一部分零件，但是因为花钱较多，拖了年把都没解决。这次，车间主任金汉臣领着我们到机器旁边去看：‘你们说该换不该换？’我不懂技术，但是看了并条机牙齿磨灭的情况，也认为该换了。各车间向厂长办公室提出的问题一共有九十三个，只有三个问题需要基本建设投资暂时不能解决，其余的九十个问题都在三、四月份内解决了。
    多下去，少开会
      “这时候，我们还整顿了生产指挥制度和工作制度。其中有项规定是工厂一级的干部每天必须有五小时直接处理和研究生产问题，只有三小时开会和读文件的时间。车间一级的干部每天巡视生产现场和研究生产问题六小时，只有两小时学文件和开会。
      “你问我们是用什么办法减少会议，实现这个制度吗？我们把会议排队，决定哪些会可以合并，哪些会可以减少。例如过去有三个旬分析会：质量分析会、用棉量分析会和全面计划完成情况分析会，一个月仅是旬分析会就得开九次。现在我们把它们并在一起，一个月开三次就行了。还有：过去是每天上午开生产动态分析会，分析薄弱环节，下午开日常生产会，布置技术措施，闹得大家成天忙着开会。我们就改为三天一次。因为许多具体问题都在深入工作中直接解决了，三天一次也照样能解决问题。
      “我们还改变了开会的方法。过去总是领导上念报告念一个多钟头，事先将问题说得很肯定，大家没啥说的，便东拉一句，西扯一句，讨论一番，最后领导总结，还是原来的意见。会议拖的时间很长，质量不高。我们现在就改为：开会前发给大家一张生产统计表，一开会，就由各车间谈自己完成或没完成指标的原因和解决办法，最后才由领导将大家意见总结起来。这样既能缩短每次会议的时间，也能集中大家的意见，发挥大家的积极性，真正起到开会的作用。
      “我们还强调开专业会，每个会集中研究和解决一个问题。这样，问题研究得深，也解决得系统。
    “将管理工作整顿一番后，大家的反映很好。两个总工程师说：‘这下把我们解放了。有时间深入车间，到车间也安心。’过去，他们每天早上也有一个多钟头巡视生产的时间，但是因为会议很多，有些会还得他们主持，因此往往一边走，一边看表，不能安心巡视。对技术措施执行情况，也是问问技术员：‘进行得怎样？’技术员说：‘不错。’就算了，不能亲自检查。巡视回来后，就开会，从上午开到下午，从下午开到下班，没有时间具体研究生产问题。这次整顿后，他们下车间就很安心，还带着千分尺亲自去量钢丝隔距，亲自动手拿起毛棍看机器是不是清洁。科室工作也开始改变了‘等事上门’的作风。试验科的同志还创造性地研究出‘质量限额追踪检查制度’。过去，试验科只知道哪个车间的哪个指标没完成，但是不知道为什么完不成。建立这个制度后，一查出质量问题，就追踪到具体机台、具体部件和个人操作上，查出原因，及时纠正，对提高产品质量起了很大作用。
                      （未完）
