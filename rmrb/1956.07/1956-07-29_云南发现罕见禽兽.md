    Yunnan Discovers Rare Birds and Animals

    (Our report) The Chinese Academy of Sciences biological expedition discovered many kinds of nationally rare birds and animals in southern and eastern Yunnan Province. In terms of birds, species such as the Hawfinch, Long-tailed Broadbill, Bohemian Waxwing, Rufous-crowned Pitta, Mrs. Gould's Sunbird, Hodgson's Hawk-cuckoo, Red Avadavat, and Green Magpie have not been previously recorded in Yunnan. In addition, the expedition discovered the tailorbird, which uses its beak to sew leaves together to make nests; the weaver bird, which builds nests that look like woven cloth; and the Red Junglefowl, the ancestor of the domestic chicken. In terms of mammals, there are the tree shrews, which are semi-arboreal and semi-terrestrial, and are in between primates and insectivores; the slow loris, which remains motionless in trees during the day, dozing off; the brush-tailed porcupine, which drags a long tail like a broom; the Chinese bamboo rat, which has thick fur all over its body; and the spotted linsang, which has spots on its back, all of which are rare animals in our country.

    Another dispatch: According to Yunnan Daily, two dinosaur fossil skeletons were recently discovered near Gongfu Village, Wuding County, Yunnan Province. Not long ago, the Geological Teaching and Research Group of Kunming Institute of Technology discovered a fossil buried in deep red marl on the edge of a gully while observing the strata conditions in the Gongfu Village area of Wuding County. When the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences sent people to excavate, two types of dinosaur teeth were discovered, proving that there are two dinosaur fossil skeletons here. After dozens of days of excavation, the two animal fossils were unearthed. One of them is twelve meters long. According to experts, these fossils are ancient creatures from 110 million to 170 million years ago and are valuable materials for the study of paleontology and stratigraphy.

    云南发现罕见禽兽
    本报讯　中国科学院生物考察队在云南省南部和东部发现了许多种全国罕见的禽兽。鸟类方面，有花头雀、长尾阔嘴鸟、和平鸟、棕头八色、紫鵊太阳鸟、平尾燕、红色黄、绿鹊等都是云南过去没有记载过的。此外还发现能用嘴缝树叶作窝的缝叶莺、搭的巢像织布一样的织布鸟、以及家鸡的老祖宗——原鸡等。在兽类方面，有半树栖半地居的、界于灵长类和食虫类之间的树鼠句、白天在树上一动不动的打瞌睡的懒猴、拖着一条帚把一样的长尾巴的帚尾刺猪、全身生着粗厚毛皮的粗毛竹鼠、以及背上有斑纹的斑背灵猫等，都是我国罕见的动物。　（云南日报编辑部）
    又讯　据云南日报消息：在云南省武定县拱福村附近，最近发现了两架恐龙类动物的化石。不久前，昆明工学院地质教研组在武定县拱福村一带观察地层状况时，发现一块化石埋藏在一条冲沟边沿深红色的泥灰岩中。中国科学院古脊椎动物研究所派人前往挖掘时，发现了恐龙类动物的牙齿两种，这证明了这里有着两架恐龙类动物的化石，经过数十天的挖掘，这两架动物化石被取出来了。其中一条有十二公尺长。经专家的判断，这是一亿一千万年至一亿七千万年前的古生物的化石，是研究古生物和地层状况的宝贵资料。
