Newly Discovered Ancient Qin Score
Recently, the Guangdong Provincial Antiquities Preservation Committee discovered fifty rare guqin scores for the seven-stringed zither. These fifty pieces, published in Li Guangbao's "Wuxue Shanfang Qin Score" in the thirteenth year of the Guangxu reign (1887), are currently the only known printed edition discovered in China. Among them, "Clear Spring in the Valley," "Reminiscence of the Past," "Five Trees in the Wind," "Two Cranes Listening to the Spring," and "Invocation of Spirits" are parts of the renowned "Ancient Gang Extant Score," which had been lost.
The seven-stringed guqin is a very ancient Chinese musical instrument with the most tones. It is said to have a history of thousands of years. According to historical records, there was already a guqin score, the "Youlan Ancient Scroll," during the Sui Dynasty. More than one hundred kinds of qin scores have now been discovered. From the "Yi Lan Cao," "Shui Xian Cao," "Sha Shan Two Pieces," "Clear Spring in the Valley," and "Xiao Xiang Waters and Clouds" discovered this time, one can hear the sounds and rhythms of ancient Chinese qin scores. In the late Southern Song Dynasty, a group of guqin masters followed the young Emperor Song to Xinhui County, Guangdong Province, after which the guqin began to spread in Guangdong. The "Ancient Gang Extant Score" was compiled and engraved in Xinhui County by these musicians who moved south at the end of the Song and the beginning of the Yuan Dynasties.

    新发掘出来的古琴谱
    最近，广东省文物保管委员会发掘出五十曲国内稀有的七弦古琴谱。这五十曲刊在光绪十三年李光宝刻的“悟雪山房琴谱”上的琴谱，是目前国内发现的唯一刻本。其中“碧涧流泉”、“怀古”、“五树临风”、“双鹤听泉”和“神化引”五曲，是目前已经失传的著名“古岗遗谱”中的一部分。
    七弦古琴是中国很古老的、音阶最多的一种乐器，相传已经有数千年历史。根据史料记载，隋朝时就已经有古琴谱——幽兰古卷。现在已经发现的琴谱有一百多种。从这次发掘出来的“猗兰操”、“水仙操”、“煞山二曲”、“碧涧流泉”和“萧湘水云”等曲里，可以听到中国古代琴谱的音韵和节奏。南宋末年一批古琴家随宋少帝逃到广东新会县后，古琴在广东开始流传。“古岗遗谱”就是宋末元初这些南下的音乐家在新会县编刻的。
