    Merged Cooperatives (II) (Picture)

   (Adapted from Xu Guangyao's original work "Shuming and Yinghua")
    5  Shuming worked very happily in the mutual aid group. He had a bumper harvest in the first year, and in the second year he transferred to the cooperative. Shuming also joined the Party, was elected a model worker, and also served as the secretary of the village Communist Youth League branch. Almost everyone wanting to join the cooperative crowded Shuming's doors.
    6  Li Baichuan, who served as the deputy secretary of the Party branch, was greatly stimulated: "Good lad, trying to get ahead of me!" In order to compete with Shuming for the masses, in a fit of pique, he established a second cooperative at the west end of the village.
    7  At this time, Yinghua graduated from senior primary school, joined the Communist Youth League, and became a propagandist in the village. She was often together with Shuming for meetings, lectures, and work. Although the two gradually became acquainted, they were particularly proper on the surface, always feeling that the relationship was somewhat special.
    8  The elders of the two families (Luo Tai and Li Baichuan), were still like enemies. Every time they met, they turned their backs on each other, and no one could reconcile them. This made the following story even more complicated.

    屠鸿痕改编·  江荧　画
   （据徐光耀原作“树明和莺花”改编）
    5　树明在互助组里干得挺欢，头一年就丰收，第二年便转社，树明也入了党，当选了劳动模范，还兼着村青年团支部书记。要求入社的几乎挤破了树明家的两扇大门。
    6　担任党支部副书记的李百川，大受刺激：“好小子，要在我头上冒尖啊！”为了跟树明争群众，一气，在屯子西头成立了一个第二社。
    7　这时莺花在高小毕了业，参加了青年团，在屯子里当了宣传员，开会、听课、工作跟树明常在一块。两人虽然渐渐相熟，表面却格外正经，总觉关系有些特别。
    8　两家的老人（罗泰和李百川），则仍是仇家似的，每次见面总是脊梁对脊梁，没有谁能使他们和好。这也就使得以下的故事更加复杂了。
