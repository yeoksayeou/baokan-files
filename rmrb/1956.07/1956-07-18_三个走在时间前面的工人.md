Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, July 16th: In the Qishuyan Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory, three advanced producers have already completed six years' worth of work from the start of the first Five-Year Plan, and are now starting on the work for 1959. These three advanced producers are: Zhuang Minggeng, Ying Qiusheng, and Wang Genpei.

Zhuang Minggeng is a national railway advanced producer and had already completed the five years' worth of work stipulated by the original plan in 1955. Since returning from the National Advanced Producers Representative Conference this year, he has been doing finishing work he had never done before. He consulted with Master Cao Fuda, a lathe operator in the next shop, who helped him improve the shape of his cutting tools, immediately breaking the quota by about 80%. Later, he devised his own convex turning tool, which shortened the time to machine a large gear from the original quota of 90 minutes per piece to only 50 minutes per piece. As a result, by the end of June, he had completed six years, one month, and four days' worth of work. In the first ten days of July, he exceeded his planned workload by seventy hours.

Ying Qiusheng was originally a student in Zhuang Minggeng's advanced experience study class. After learning Zhuang Minggeng's experience at the beginning of this year, his performance has been consistently excellent. His lathe speed has now reached 1,200 revolutions, and he has also installed an automatic stop device on the lathe. By June 15th, he had completed six years of work.

Wang Genpei is a foreman in the foundry workshop. His work is characterized by short auxiliary time and good product quality. By the end of June this year, he had completed six years, three months, and fifteen days of work.

    三个走在时间前面的工人
    新华社南京16日电　戚墅堰机车车辆修理工厂，已经有三位先进生产者从第一个五年计划开始到现在，完成了六年工作量，开始做1959年的工作了。这三位先进生产者是：庄铭耕、应秋生、王根培。
    庄铭耕是全国铁路先进生产者，1955年就已经完成原定计划规定的五年工作量。今年从全国先进生产者代表会议回来以后，他一直做过去没有做过的光刀活。他请教隔壁车床曹福大老师傅，帮他改进了刀具的形状，立刻突破定额80％左右。后来，他又自己琢磨出一种凸形车刀，在车大齿轮时，由原来定额90分钟车一只，缩短到只要50分钟车一只。就这样，到六月底为止，他已经做完了六年一个月零四天的活。七月份头十天里，他又比计划多做了七十个小时的工作。
    应秋生本来是庄铭耕先进经验学习班的学员。今年年初学了庄铭耕的经验以后，成绩一直很好。现在他的车床转速已经达到了一千二百转，并且还在车床上装置了自动停刀器。到六月十五日，他就完成了六年的工作量。
    王根培是翻砂车间的一个工长。他工作的特点是辅助时间短，产品质量好，到今年六月底，他完成了六年三个月零十五天的工作量。
