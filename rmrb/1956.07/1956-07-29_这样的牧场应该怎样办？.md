How Should Such Pastures Be Managed?
Liu Yuan

In the Hulunbuir League of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, there are eleven state-owned pastures (including thirty-four branch pastures) raising more than 29,000 head of livestock. One of the main tasks of these state-owned pastures is to cultivate and breed the local fine breed "Sanhe cattle" for promotion. However, these state-owned pastures are poorly managed, causing serious losses and waste. If they continue to operate as they are, all the livestock will be eaten up and lost within a year or two.

In 1955, the production cost of these state-owned pastures was 3.21 million yuan (including employee wages, feed, public expenses, etc.), and the total income from milk, hides, wool, and other items was 700,000 yuan. The net expenditure after offsetting income and expenses was 2.51 million yuan, and this does not include the depreciation of large-scale capital construction investments. The overspending of 2.51 million yuan is equivalent to the value of 12,500 head of large cattle on the pastures. Last year, these state-owned pastures bred a total of 3,801 calves, but 2,428 large and small cattle died. After offsetting births and deaths, the net increase was 1,373 calves, which is the main cost of the 2.51 million yuan (said to be the main cost because a small number of horses and sheep were also produced). This means the cost is about 1,700 yuan for a one-year-old "Sanhe cattle." Where can we find a buyer for it?

So how is the situation this year? According to the plan of the Hulunbuir League State-Owned Pasture Administration Bureau, the production investment this year has increased to 4.9 million yuan, and it is estimated that the amount of overspending after offsetting income and expenses for the whole year will be even greater than last year. The plan is to breed 5,981 calves this year, but judging from the current situation, this plan is far from being completed. From January to May (this period is the main calving season), incomplete statistics show that a total of 2,755 calves were born, and 2,019 large and small cattle died, a net increase of 736, which is even lower than the net increase rate in the same period last year.

This newspaper reported on the poor management, serious losses and waste, and serious livestock deaths in the state-owned pastures of the Hulunbuir League on April 30th. At the same time, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and relevant departments of the Central Government also sent people to the pastures for inspection, and the work of the pastures has been improved to some extent. However, effective measures have not yet been taken to fundamentally change the serious situation of excessive consumption and losses and low production income in the management of these pastures.

How should these state-owned pastures continue to operate? It is time to mobilize the pasture workers to put forward various rationalization proposals based on the actual conditions, and for the relevant leading departments to take fundamental countermeasures from the business policy to specific measures.

    这样的牧场应该怎样办？
    刘源
    内蒙古自治区呼伦贝尔盟有十一个国营牧场（包括三十四个分场），养着二万九千多头牲畜。这些国营牧场的主要任务之一，是要培育和繁殖当地的优良品种“三河牛”，以便推广。但这些国营牧场经营管理不善，造成严重的损失和浪费。若按目前的情况继续办下去，一两年内就会把全部牲畜吃光赔净。
    1955年，这些国营牧场的生产费用是三百二十一万元（包括职工工资、饲料、公杂费等），全年的牛奶、皮、毛等各项收入共七十万元，收支相抵，净支出二百五十一万元，而大批基本建设投资的折旧费还未算在内。二百五十一万元的超支，等于牧场一万二千五百头大牛的价值。去年一年，这些国营牧场共繁殖牛犊3，801头，死亡大、小牛2，428头。生、死相抵，纯增犊牛1，373头，这就是二百五十一万元的主要代价（说是主要代价，因另外还生产了少量的马和羊）。这样成本约等于一千七百元一头一岁大的“三河牛”，要到什么地方才能找到它的顾主呢？
    那么今年的情况如何呢？根据呼伦贝尔盟国营牧场管理局的计划，今年的生产投资增加到四百九十万元，估计全年收、支相抵所超支的数目字，要比去年还大。计划今年繁殖牛犊5，981头，但从目前的情况来看，这个计划是远不能完成的。从一月到五月（这一个时期是主要产犊季节）的不完全统计，共生牛犊2，755头，死大、小牛2，019头，纯增736头，这比去年同时期的纯增率还要低。
    对呼伦贝尔盟国营牧场经营管理不善、损失浪费和牲畜死亡的严重情形，本报在四月三十日曾进行了报道。同时，内蒙古自治区和中央有关部门也先后派人到牧场进行了检查，牧场的工作也有了某些改进。但至今还未能采取有效措施，足以根本改变这些牧场在经营管理上消耗、损失过大而生产收入很低的严重局面。
    这些国营牧场应该如何办下去呢？是发动牧场职工根据现实条件提出各种合理化建议，和有关领导部门从经营方针到具体措施上采取根本对策的时候了。
