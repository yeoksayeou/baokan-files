Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 8th: Wuhan's temperature has risen sharply in recent days, with the outdoor temperature reaching over 110 degrees Fahrenheit. In order to ensure the safety of construction and installation workers operating in the hot weather, the Wuhan Municipal People's Committee has notified the construction departments in Wuhan that, starting from the 8th, whenever the outdoor temperature reaches 110 degrees Fahrenheit (based on the temperature at 1 p.m. that day), the daily operating time for construction and installation workers will be reduced from eight hours to seven hours.

The Municipal People's Committee also pointed out to the construction departments that they should also do a good job in all safety and health work for construction in hot weather, and appropriately adjust working hours, such as making full use of the morning hours for construction.

The Municipal People's Committee decided that after the reduction of working hours, the wages of hourly workers will still be paid according to the original standards; in addition to calculating the wages of piece-rate workers according to the eight-hour work quota and unit price, they will also be paid an additional one hour of standard wages.

This newspaper, Wuhan, 7th: Wuhan has entered summer, and many construction sites and factories have installed heatstroke prevention and cooling equipment to protect the health of workers. The No. 101 and No. 201 construction sites under the city have erected sunshades on the scaffolding. In addition to building many mat sheds, the Yangtze River Bridge construction site also plans to set up movable canvas umbrellas on the bridge piers in the water for workers to rest temporarily. In addition to using the original heatstroke prevention equipment, the Nanyang Tobacco Factory has added exhaust fans in three workshops and installed dust collectors in all cigarette-making rooms. The Wuhan Pharmaceutical Factory has added more than 30 fans and wrapped sterilizing pots, steam pipes, and the like with asbestos, and used air conditioners to lower the room temperature in the injection medicine department. All units have also set up drinks such as salt soda and mung bean soup, as well as some heat-relieving medicines. Some salt soda is also mixed with banana essence and saccharin, which is cool and palatable.

While improving the working environment, all units have also paid attention to improving the living environment so that workers can eat well, sleep well, and rest well. The Wuhan Heavy Machinery Factory construction site has built open-air tea gardens and shower rooms for the night and solved the problem of workers purchasing mosquito nets. The Party organization and medical personnel of the No. 401 construction site under the city also organized night work teams to check the workers' sleeping conditions and prevent workers from catching cold by sleeping in the open. Some units have also adjusted working hours to allow workers to rest during the hottest noon hours.

    武汉建筑业热天工作七小时
    许多工厂和工地加强防暑降温工作
    新华社武汉8日电　武汉地区连日气温陡升，室外温度最高已上升到华氏一百一十度以上。武汉市人民委员会为了保障建筑安装工人在暑天高温下操作的安全，已经通知武汉地区各建筑部门，决定从八日起，凡是室外温度高达华氏一百一十度（以当天下午一时温度为准）的时候，建筑安装工人每天的操作时间由八小时改为七小时。
    市人民委员会还向各施工部门指出，应该同时作好暑天施工各项安全卫生工作，适当调整工作时间，如充分利用早晨的时间施工等。
    市人民委员会决定，在缩短工时以后，计时工人的工资仍按原标准发给；计件工人除依照八小时的工作定额和单价计算工资以外，再加发一小时的标准工资。
    本报武汉7日电　武汉已进入夏季，许多工地、工厂都安置了防暑降温设备，保护工人的健康。市属一零一工地和二零一工地在脚手架上张起了凉棚，长江大桥工地除搭了许多席棚外，还准备在水上桥墩设置活动帆布伞，供工人临时休息。南洋烟厂除利用原有防暑设备外，又在三个车间添置了排气机，在卷烟间全部装上了吸尘器。武汉制药厂增添了三十多部风扇，并且用石棉将消毒锅、蒸气管等包扎起来，用冷气机降低针药部的室温。各单位还设置了盐汽水、绿豆汤等饮料和若干解暑药品，有的盐气水中还掺有香蕉精和糖精，清凉可口。
    在改善工作环境的同时，各单位也注意了改善生活环境，使工人能吃好、睡好、休息好。武汉重型工业机工工地修建了夜间露天茶园、淋浴室，并解决了工人购置蚊帐的问题。市属四零一工地党组织和医疗人员还组织了夜间工作组，检查工人睡眠情况，防止工人露天睡觉受凉。有些单位还调整了工作时间，让工人在最热的中午休息。
