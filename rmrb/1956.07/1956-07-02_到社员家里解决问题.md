Solving Problems at 社员's Homes
　　Shang Kai
After the Jinxing Agricultural, Forestry and Livestock Production Cooperative in Pingshun County, Shanxi Province, transitioned to an advanced cooperative, the cooperative's management committee concentrated its efforts on leading spring plowing production, neglecting the care for the 社员's lives and squeezing 社员's household labor time, which caused dissatisfaction among many people. 社员 Yang Jisheng directly criticized the cooperative director, Li Shunda, and deputy director, Shen Jilan: "You only know how to inspect production, but you don't visit 社员's homes to see if they have enough to eat and wear." These two sentences reminded the cooperative committee cadres, and they immediately held a meeting to discuss the issue, deciding to conduct a visit to 社员's families.
　　The Jinxing Cooperative had a total of 281 households, scattered in a mountain gully that was fifteen or sixteen li long. The fifteen members of the cooperative committee set off separately, visiting each household. During the visits, it was discovered that fifty-two households had run out of firewood, and ninety-four households had no pocket money. For example, Zhang Qifa had gone without oil for lighting for several nights, while the cooperative had a large stock of firewood and some sideline savings.
　　After returning from the visits, the cooperative committee immediately lent firewood to the 社员 and allocated 730 yuan in cash to 250 households, enabling them to buy salt, vegetables, and lamp oil. Special care was given to individual households with particular difficulties. For example, the wife of goat worker Hou Maicheng was ill. In addition to lending her medical expenses, the cooperative committee also sent a car to take her to the city for treatment.
　　During the visits, it was also found that 社员's private plots had not been cultivated, and dilapidated houses had not been repaired. The cooperative committee also arranged household labor time for 社员 according to their actual needs and allocated fertilizer to 社员's private plots. The cooperative committee also called on 社员 to promote the spirit of mutual assistance and love to help each other solve unforeseen difficulties that 社员 might encounter temporarily. At that time, a moving story occurred: The 社员 Song Wenmei, an old lady, was raising eight hens that were about to lay eggs. Unfortunately, one night, they were all eaten by wolves. Old lady Song cried all day and did not eat. At this time, many 社员 voluntarily sent her chickens and eggs so she could hatch chicks again. The 社员's actions of mutual assistance and love moved Song Wenmei so much that she couldn't sleep well all night. She said that she would definitely take good care of the two pigs she was raising for the cooperative.
　　The cooperative committee's deep concern for the 社员's living problems made the 社员 feel the strength of the collective and the warmth of the socialist family. Everyone voluntarily came forward to help the cooperative solve the problems of a shortage of fodder and seeds. 社员 Zhang Shengcai had several hundred jin of fodder at home, and he was afraid that he would not be paid in cash, so he did not sell it to the cooperative. After the cooperative committee member visited the 社员's family, he said, "The cooperative cares about us, how can we not care about the cooperative!" He voluntarily sent the fodder to the cooperative. Under his lead and influence, the 社员 contributed a total of 12,000 jin of fodder, 12,000 jin of potato seeds, and 200 jin of bean seeds as investment. With no living difficulties, the 社员 were full of enthusiasm for production. The cooperative's fodder and seed problems were also solved.

    到社员家里解决问题
    商恺
    山西省平顺县金星农林牧生产合作社转高级社以后，社管理委员会集中力量领导春耕生产，忽视了对社员生活的关怀，挤掉了社员的家务劳动时间，引起了许多人的不满。社员杨吉生当面向社主任李顺达、副主任申纪兰提出批评：“你们光知道检查生产，就不到社员家里看看有无吃穿。”两句话提醒了社委会的干部，他们立即开会讨论这个问题，决定对社员家庭进行一次访问。
    金星社共有281户社员，分散在一条长达十五、六里的山沟里。社委会的十五个委员分头出发，挨家挨户地进行访问。在访问当中发现有五十二户社员已经断了烧柴，有九十四户社员没有零花钱，像张其法就有好几夜没油点灯了，而社里却存有大批的烧柴和一部分副业存款。
    访问回来，社委会立即把烧柴借给了社员；又拨出七百三十元现款，分配给二百五十户社员，使他们能够秤盐、买菜、买灯油。对于个别有特殊困难的户，给予特别照顾。如羊工侯麦成的妻子有病，社委会除了借给她医药费外，还派车送她到城里去治疗。
    在访问当中，还发现社员的自留地没有整理，房子破了的也没有修缮。社委会又根据社员的实际需要，给社员安排了家务劳动时间，并给社员的自留地调剂了肥料。社员还可能临时发生估计不到的困难问题，社委会又号召社员发扬互助友爱的精神，彼此帮助解决。当时曾发生了这样一件动人的故事：社员宋文梅老太太养着八只母鸡，都快生蛋了，不幸一天夜里全被狼吃了，宋老太太哭了一天没有吃饭。这时候，便有许多社员自动地给她送了鸡和鸡蛋来，让她再孵小鸡。社员们这种互助友爱的行动，使宋文梅感动得一夜没有睡好，她表示一定要把给社里喂着的两只猪喂好。
    社委会对社员生活问题的深切关心，使社员们感觉到了集体的力量和社会主义大家庭的温暖，大家自动地出来帮助社里解决缺饲草、缺籽种的问题。社员张生才家中有几百斤饲草，他怕不给现钱，没有卖给社里。社务委员访问社员家庭以后，他说：“社关心咱，咱还能不关心社！”自动地把饲草送到社里去。在他的带动和影响下，社员一共拿出饲草一万二千斤，马铃薯籽种一万二千斤，豆种二百斤，作为投资。社员们没有生活上的困难了，生产情绪非常饱满。社的饲草和籽种问题也解决了。
