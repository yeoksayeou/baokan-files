Xinhua News Agency, Nanping, July 30th (Xinhua Reporter Zheng Ting) Reported: At 4:00 PM on the 29th, a branch line of the Yingtan-Xiamen Railway was paved from Waiyang to Nanping City.

On Sunday morning, when the track-laying train was still three kilometers away from Nanping Station, people from Nanping city and countryside flocked there in groups to watch the train. From the construction site to the station, tea stations were set up every ten steps or so along the road. Street women and young students returning home for vacation enthusiastically served tea to the soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Railway Corps track-laying team. When the track-laying train passed through the welcoming arch, the cheers of the crowd and the roar of the train resounded in unison.

Nanping is a famous land and water transportation hub in Fujian Province. The railway line under construction will also extend from Nanping to Fuzhou. In the future, the transportation of locally produced timber and special products, and the transportation of goods from other places to this area, will have extremely convenient conditions, which is of great significance to the prosperity of the economy of Fujian Province.

    鹰厦铁路支线铺轨到南平
    新华社南平30日电　新华社记者郑汀报道：二十九日下午四点钟，鹰潭—厦门铁路的一条支线已经从外洋铺轨到南平城。
    星期日清晨，当铺轨列车在离南平车站还有三公里的时候，南平城乡人民成群结队拥向那里去观看火车。从工地到车站，沿路旁每隔十多步就设有一个茶水站，街道妇女和远道返乡度假期的青年学生，热情地不断送茶水给中国人民解放军铁道兵铺轨队的战士们饮用。当铺轨列车穿过迎接列车的彩门时，群众的欢呼声和列车的轰鸣响成一片。
    南平是福建省著名的水陆运输纽带。正在修筑中的铁路线还将由南平伸展到福州去。今后这里盛产的木材和土特产品的外运和从外地运输物品到这一地区，有了极为方便的条件，对繁荣福建省的经济有着重大的意义。
