    Jump and Leap (Folk Tale)
    Shi Tan
    A schoolteacher needed to go out to take care of something. Stepping out the door, he couldn't distinguish east from west, so he found a student to lead the way.

    After walking for a while, they came across a puddle blocking the road. Fortunately, the puddle was only two or three feet wide. The student, walking in front, lifted his leg and jumped over it. However, the schoolteacher encountered a problem. He slowly walked to the edge of the puddle, looked around, took a few steps to the left, a few steps to the right, and couldn't get across. So he asked the student:

    "How can I get across?"

    "Jump over!" the student replied from the other side of the puddle.

    Hearing this, the teacher stood by the water's edge, meticulously put his feet together, and, without moving, mustered his strength. With both feet exerting force simultaneously, he jumped towards the other side. With a "thump," the teacher didn't make it across and fell into the puddle. The student couldn't help but exclaim, "Oh!" The teacher, annoyed, shouted, "Leap! Leap! Why didn't you say so sooner?" He waded through the water and climbed onto dry land.

    The student didn't understand what the teacher had just said and hurriedly said:

    "Didn't I say it sooner? Didn't I tell you to jump? You lift one leg and jump over, and you'll be fine. Who told you to put both feet together..."

      "Ah, look at what you've been studying!" the schoolteacher said through gritted teeth. "The books say: 'Two feet together is called jump, one foot is called leap.' That is, jumping with a pair of feet together is called 'jump,' lifting only one foot is called 'leap'! You told me to 'jump,' so I 'jumped'! If you had told me to 'leap' earlier..."

    The student didn't seem to fully understand what the teacher was saying. He only saw the teacher's wet feet and his own dry feet.

    跳和跃（民间故事）
    石潭
    教书先生要出去办点儿事。走出大门，可分不清东西南北，就找了个学生给他领道儿。
    二人走了一阵，碰见一个水坑挡住了路。好在水坑不过二三尺宽，学生走在前边，一抬腿，就跳过去了。不过，教书先生却碰到了困难。他慢慢走到水边，东看看，西看看，左绕几步，右绕几步，怎么也过不去。就问学生道：
    “我可怎么过去啊？”
    “你跳过来呀！”学生在水坑那边回答。
    先生听了，就站在水边，把两只脚细细致致地并在一块儿，一动不动地鼓足了劲，双脚同时用力朝那边一跳。只听得“通”的一声，先生没跳过去，跌进了水坑里。学生不觉叫道：“哟！”先生可气冲冲地嚷道：“跃！跃！你怎么不早说？”一边淌着水，爬到干地上来。
    学生没听懂刚才老师的话，忙道：
    “我怎么没早说？我不是叫你跳么？你抬起一条腿，往过一跳，不就好好过来了么？谁叫你俩脚并拢……”
      “唉，你看你念的什么书啊；”教书先生咬牙切齿地说着。“书上有言：‘双脚曰跳，单脚曰跃’。就是说，一双脚并拢跳起来才叫‘跳’、光抬起一只脚，那叫‘跃’！你叫我‘跳’嘛，我还不就‘跳’啦！你要早些叫我‘跃’……”
    学生好像还没有完全听懂老师的话。他只看见了老师的一双湿脚和自己的一双干脚。
