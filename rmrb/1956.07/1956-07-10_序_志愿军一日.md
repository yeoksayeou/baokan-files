    Preface to "A Day in the Life of a Volunteer"
    Guo Moruo
    Resisting America and Aiding Korea was a patriotic movement of great historical significance since the founding of the People's Republic of China.
    The most outstanding sons and daughters of the Chinese people—the Chinese People's Volunteer Army—crossed the Yalu River just one year after the establishment of the People's Republic of China, assisting the heroic Korean people in repelling the aggression of imperialism, defending the independence of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and consolidating the borders of the motherland.
    This noble spirit of patriotism and internationalism became a model for all the Chinese people, setting off a wave of patriotism throughout China. People from all walks of life in China supported the Korean front with extremely high enthusiasm for production and construction. After nearly three years of effort, we finally won peace and promoted the construction of the motherland.
    This noble spirit of patriotism and internationalism won the praise of peace-loving and justice-upholding people all over the world. We also won a great victory in terms of morality and justice. Therefore, our international status has been improving day by day at a rapid pace; the influence of our country in international affairs, especially in the cause of defending Asian and world peace, cannot be denied by any stubborn enemies of peace.
    Since the Korean Armistice, there has been the Indochina Peninsula armistice, the Bandung Asian-African Conference, and the Geneva Four-Power Summit. The call for peaceful coexistence and disarmament has become popular all over the world, and the international tension deliberately created by the U.S. war group and its servants has been easing day by day. Today, we can say that war is not inevitable. There are naturally various factors contributing to this situation, and it is the result of the joint efforts of peace-loving and justice-upholding people all over the world, but the victory of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army in resisting America and aiding Korea should be one of the important factors that played a pivotal role. This is a great achievement of the Resist America, Aid Korea movement with world significance.
    Such a great movement to defend peace and oppose aggression must have a detailed written record, leaving behind educational memorial literature for future generations of Chinese people and peace-loving and justice-upholding people all over the world.
    We should thank the responsible comrades of the Political Department of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army for issuing the call to compile "A Day in the Life of a Volunteer" as early as the first winter after the Korean Armistice, setting off a writing upsurge in the entire army. The writing situation, as we can see from the "Editor's Note," was almost equivalent to fighting on the battlefield. The nearly one million words of "A Day in the Life of a Volunteer" presented here were finally selected from more than 13,600 articles, totaling more than 20 million words, which were submitted to the editorial board after strict selection at each level in the army.
    What an amazing large-scale writing movement, and what an amazing organized and strict selection! The "A Day in the Life of a Volunteer" that has been selected in this way is truly worthy of being a war history of the Resist America, Aid Korea movement with flesh and blood, and it is an immortal monument built by the soldiers themselves.
    From a literary point of view, this is also a great collective creation. What is written here are all real people and real events, but the moving and admirable nature of these real people and the breathtaking nature of these real events surpass and exceed the heroic figures and legendary stories that any great writer of any nation in the world can create. The heroes of the Volunteer Army have created many unprecedented archetypes and unprecedented feats. But these typical figures and feats are real people and real events, not out of fantasy, which makes them even more commendable and fascinating.
    This "A Day in the Life of a Volunteer" is compiled from short stories, which is precisely the advantage of this book. Each story is short, so it doesn't take time to read when everyone is busy. Each story is a self-contained paragraph; some are even collections, showing a variety of unity. This diverse unity is more suitable as a comment on the whole book, because although it is a collection of short stories, what is written is the entire Resist America, Aid Korea movement, which is an entire theme praising patriotism and internationalism. This naturally forms a large garden with a hundred flowers blooming. This naturally forms a great symphony with the harmony of all kinds of musical instruments. I am not exaggerating in making such comments; in fact, I cannot find more appropriate words to describe this immortal and world-class work.
    Needless to say, "A Day in the Life of a Volunteer" is a very good textbook of patriotism and internationalism. I think people above the higher grades of elementary school can read it, and I guarantee that everyone will be interested and will love it. I myself have this experience: after reading one article, I want to read the second and third articles; I simply don't want to stop, and I am more fascinated than when I read "Dream of the Red Chamber" or "Water Margin" when I was a child. I have never had this phenomenon when reading new literary works by writers. To be honest, I can't read more than four or five lines of some people's works. This is naturally mainly because I am impatient, but writers always like to put on makeup and pile up adjectives. Sentences always like to be dragged so long. At a glance, you can see that the writers are twisting words, pretending, or taking square steps, or acting coy. It seems that we can fix this style.
    Although "A Day in the Life of a Volunteer" is nearly one million words, I only feel that it is too little, not too much. Reading the words written by the soldiers is like eating raw cucumbers and fresh chili peppers, which is really refreshing. Enough flavor! How vivid! How lively! I have a faint complaint: Is the editorial board a little too strict in the selection? I am afraid that there are still some good things in those large numbers of works that have been selected out, right? Even if they are not jewels, they are always valuable jade stones and ore seedlings, which will become jewels as long as they are properly processed. Those selected works, at least, should be said to have many valuable materials. Therefore, I would like to suggest to the editorial board: Can we consider re-selecting those unselected texts after the publication of "A Day in the Life of a Volunteer" and publish a sequel to "A Day in the Life of a Volunteer"?
    I think the title "A Day in the Life of a Volunteer" is very well chosen. As stated in the "Editor's Note," this "does not require the authors to only write about what happened in one day." I personally would also like to interpret this "one day" as a thousand years as one day, ten thousand years as one day, that is to say, the Resist America, Aid Korea movement is always fresh, and the collective creation that records this great movement is also always fresh. The Resist America, Aid Korea war lasted for two years and nine months. I roughly calculated that it was one thousand and six days. This reminds me that the Arab nation has a great collection of literary stories called "Arabian Nights," also called "One Thousand and One Nights." A queen told a story every night, telling one thousand and one nights, that is, telling one thousand and one stories, and corrected the homicidal nature of a tyrant. "Arabian Nights" is a treasure in the world's literary treasury. I believe that our one thousand and six-day true story of defending peace in the Far East will undoubtedly become a treasure in the world's literary treasury.
    Here I would like to make another suggestion to the editorial board: We should organize a translation effort to translate this "A Day in the Life of a Volunteer" (if there is a "sequel" in the future, it should also be translated along with its "sequel") from Chinese into the languages of domestic ethnic minorities, and also into foreign languages, Russian, English, French, Korean, Hindi, Arabic, Japanese…all of them. This can further expand the fraternal friendship between the Chinese and Korean peoples cemented with blood. This can spread the education of patriotism and internationalism more widely and deeply. This is not only a contribution to world literature, but also a contribution to world peace.
    Eternal glory to the people's heroes who sacrificed in the Resist America, Aid Korea war!
                      June 22, 1956, in Beijing.

    序“志愿军一日”
    郭沫若
    抗美援朝是中华人民共和国成立以来一项具有伟大历史意义的爱国运动。
    中国人民最优秀的儿女——中国人民志愿军，在人民中国建立之后仅仅一周年的期间，渡过鸭绿江，协助英雄的朝鲜人民打退了帝国主义的侵略，保卫了朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的独立，巩固了祖国的边疆。
    这种崇高的爱国主义和国际主义的精神成为了全中国人民的模范，在全中国范围内掀起了爱国主义的热潮。全中国各阶层的人民都以极其高度的生产建设热情来支援朝鲜前线。经过将近三年的努力，我们毕竟赢得了和平，而且促进了祖国的建设。
    这种崇高的爱国主义和国际主义的精神博得了全世界爱好和平、主持正义的人们的赞仰。我们就在道谊上也打了一次大胜仗。因此，我们的国际地位也就一天一天地以很快的速度提高；我们的国家在国际事务中，特别是在保卫亚洲和世界和平的事业中，所发生的影响，是任何顽梗的和平敌人所无法否认的。
    自朝鲜停战以后，接着便有印度支那半岛的停战，便有万隆的亚非会议和日内瓦的四大国会议的召开，和平共处和裁减军备的呼声普及于全世界，美国好战集团和它的仆从们所蓄意造成的国际紧张局势一天一天的缓和下来了。在今天看来，我们可以说：战争并不是不可避免的。造成了这种局势的自然有种种因素，也是全世界爱好和平、主持正义的人们共同努力的结果，但中国人民志愿军抗美援朝的胜利总应该是起了转辙作用的重要因素之一。这是抗美援朝运动的具有世界意义的一项伟大的收获。
    这样一个伟大的保卫和平反对侵略的运动不能不有一部翔实的文字纪录，为今后世世代代的中国人民和全世界爱好和平和正义的人们留下富有教育意义的纪念文献。
    我们应该感谢中国人民志愿军政治部的负责同志，他们在朝鲜停战后的第一个冬天就及早发出了编写“志愿军一日”的号召，在全军中掀起了写作的热潮。写作的情况，我们从“编者的话”中可以看出，差不多就等于在战场上作战的情况。这儿所呈现出的将近一百万字的“志愿军一日”是从在部队中经过了逐级的严格挑选后，送交到编辑委员会的一万三千六百多篇，合计两千万字以上的作品中，最后挑选出来的。
    这是一项多么惊人的大规模的写作运动，也是一项多么惊人的有组织的严格挑选呵！经过这样挑选出来的“志愿军一日”真真是无愧于抗美援朝运动的有血有肉的战史，是要永垂不朽的由战士们自己所亲手建立的丰碑。
    如果从文学的观点来说，这也是一部伟大的集体创作。这里所写的都是真人真事，但这些真人的可歌可泣，真事的惊心动魄，比世界上任何民族的伟大作家所能创造出来的英雄人物和传奇故事，还要超越，出人意外。志愿军的英雄们创造出了不少的史无前例的典型和史无前例的丰功伟绩。但这些典型人物和丰功伟绩是真人真事，而不是出于空想，那就更加难能可贵而引人入胜了。
    这部“志愿军一日”是由短篇集成的，这正是本书的好处。每篇都短，在目前人人都很忙的时候，读起来不花费时间。每篇都是一个故事，自成段落；有的更是集锦，显出了多样的统一。这多样的统一更适合于作为全书的评语，因为尽管是短篇的集合，而所写的是一个抗美援朝的整个运动，是一个表扬爱国主义与国际主义的整个主题。这就自然形成为一座大花园，园中有百花齐放。这就自然形成为一部大交响曲，曲中有万种乐器合奏。我在这样品评，丝毫也没有夸大的意思，事实上我是找不出更恰当的语汇来形容这部不朽的具有世界性的作品。
    这部“志愿军一日”不用说是很好的一部爱国主义与国际主义的语文课本，我看自初小的高年生以上的人都是可以读的，而且保管读起来人人都感兴趣，人人都会爱不释手。我自己就有这个经验，读了一篇就想读第二篇第三篇，简直不想停留，比我小时读“红楼梦”或“水浒传”还入了迷。我读作家们的新文艺作品，是从来没有引起过这种现象的。好些人的作品，老实说，我拿起来读不上四五行就读不下去。这自然主要是由于我没有耐性，但作家们总爱搽胭抹粉，堆积形容词。句子总爱拖得那么长。一看就看出作家们在那儿咬文嚼字、装腔做势；或者是迈方步，或者是扭扭捏捏。我们这样的作风似乎是可以整它一下了。
    这部“志愿军一日”，虽然将近一百万字，但我读起来都只嫌其少，不觉其多。读战士们写出来的文字，就给吃生黄瓜、鲜海椒一样，实在是清新得很。够味！多么地生动！多么地活鲜鲜的！我倒有这样一个隐隐的埋怨：是不是编辑委员会挑选得太严格了一点？被选掉的那些大量的作品，我恐怕还会有好些好东西吧？即使不是珠宝，但总是有价值的玉璞和矿苗，只要经过一些适当的加工，就会成为珠宝的。那些被选掉的作品，至少应该说有很多是宝贵的素材。因此，我要向编辑委员会建议：是不是可以考虑在出版了“志愿军一日”之后，再把那些未入选的文字重新挑选一下，再出一部“志愿军一日”的续编？
    “志愿军一日”这个书名我觉得定得很好。如“编者的话”里所表明：这并“没有要求作者们只写在一天内所发生的事情”。我个人还愿意把这“一日”作为千年如一日，万年如一日来解，就是说抗美援朝的运动永远是新鲜的，纪录这个伟大运动的集体创作也永远是新鲜的。抗美援朝的战争经过了两年零九个月，我粗略地计算了一下，是一千零六日。这使我联想到阿剌伯民族有一部伟大的文学故事集叫“天方夜谈”，也叫“一千零一夜”。那是一位王妃每一夜说一个故事，说了一千零一夜，也就说了一千零一个故事，把一位暴君的嗜杀性纠正过来了。“天方夜谈”是世界文学宝库里面的一个瑰宝，我相信，我们这个保卫远东和平的一千零六日的真事谈，毫无疑问，也将成为世界文学宝库里面的一个瑰宝。
    在这里我要再向编辑委员会提出一个建议：我们应该组织一番翻译工作，把这部“志愿军一日”（将来如有“续编”，还要连同它的“续编”）从汉语翻成国内少数民族的文字，还要翻成外文，俄文、英文、法文、朝鲜文、印地文、阿剌伯文、日本文……都要。这样可以把中国和朝鲜人民用鲜血凝成的兄弟友谊更加扩大起来。这样可以把爱国主义和国际主义的教育，传播得更普及一些，更深入一些。这样不仅对于世界文学是一种贡献，对于世界和平也是一种贡献。
    在抗美援朝战争中牺牲了的人民英雄们永垂不朽！
