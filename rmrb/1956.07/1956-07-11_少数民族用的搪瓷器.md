    Enamelware for Ethnic Minorities
    Shanghai Huafeng and four other enamel factories have trial-produced five new products for various ethnic minorities in China.
    These new products are: butter tea pots for holding cheese and other items, pilaf plates large enough for seven or eight people to eat from, stew pots for cooking beef and mutton, and Mongolian bowls and large basins in various colors. After the samples of these new products were made, the supply and marketing departments specially solicited the opinions of commercial representatives from various ethnic minority regions stationed in Shanghai. The representatives were satisfied with these new products. Eighty thousand colored Mongolian bowls have already been shipped to areas inhabited by Mongolian people.
    In the past, the enamelware used by ethnic minorities in various places mostly relied on imports from foreign countries. In April and May of this year, the Shanghai Municipal Commercial Department collected some enamelware used by ethnic minorities, and studied the characteristics of their daily necessities from many pictures reflecting the lives of ethnic minorities, and then organized these factories to design and manufacture them. During the trial production process, each factory paid special attention to making the product quality durable. The iron sheets used by the Huafeng Enamel Factory to trial-produce pilaf plates and large basins were, on average, about twice as thick as the iron sheets used for general enamelware.
    The factories are currently trial-producing and preparing to trial-produce duck-billed kettles for ethnic minorities to use for bathing, as well as dragon-flower covered cups, basins, and kettles favored by the Tibetan people. (Xinhua News Agency)

    少数民族用的搪瓷器
    上海华丰等五家搪瓷工厂，为国内各少数民族试制了五种新产品。
    这些新产品是：盛乳酪等用的酥油壶，可供七、八人吃饭用的抓饭盘，烧牛肉羊肉用的焖锅，各种颜色的蒙古碗和大面盆。这些新产品样品制成以后，供销部门特地征求了各少数民族地区派驻上海的商业代表的意见，代表们对这些新产品感到满意。现在已经有八万只彩色蒙古碗运往蒙古族人民聚居区。
    过去，各地少数民族使用的搪瓷用品，大都靠国外进口。今年四、五月间，上海市商业部门搜集了一些少数民族使用的搪瓷品，并且从许多反映少数民族生活的图片上研究了他们日用品的特点，然后组织这几家工厂设计制造。各厂在试制过程中，特别注意使产品质量能够经久耐用。华丰搪瓷厂试制抓饭盘和大面盆所用的铁皮，平均比一般搪瓷用品的铁皮厚一倍左右。
    现在各厂正在试制和准备试制的，还有供少数民族淋浴用的鸭嘴壶和藏族人民喜爱的龙花盖杯、面盆和水壶。　　　　（新华社）
