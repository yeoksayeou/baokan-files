Xinhua News Agency, July 6th. The Central Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang held a symposium on the morning of July 4th to exchange views on the long-term coexistence and mutual supervision between the Chinese Communist Party and the democratic parties.

All participants in the symposium expressed great excitement about the major policy proposed by the CPC Central Committee. Chen Shaokuan said, "This policy of the CPC Central Committee has given us great encouragement and strength. I believe that members of the democratic parties will unite more closely around the Communist Party and contribute more to socialist construction." Liu Fei said: "I used to think that after our country entered socialism, the exploiting classes would be eliminated, and the democratic parties would no longer exist. Now I know that my view was wrong. The policy proposed by the CPC Central Committee will play a great role in promoting socialist democracy and increasing political and moral unity."

Weng Wenhao and Tang Shengzhi believed that the democratic parties had made great contributions in politics over the past few years. Tang Shengzhi said that in Hunan Province, when major measures were taken, the Communist Party and the democratic parties fully consulted with each other, and there were disputes if there were different opinions, and often disputes. In the end, everyone acted according to the unanimous conclusions.

Weng Wenhao said that whether the democratic parties can play a role is also greatly related to the quality of their own work. Weng Wenhao's opinion was endorsed by many people. Qian Changzhao said: "Only by maintaining their own health can the democratic parties strive for long-term coexistence. I think the democratic parties must conduct in-depth inspections from the central to the local levels, discover shortcomings and eliminate them, enhance their sense of responsibility politically, and enhance their seriousness in their work."

At the symposium, some opinions and criticisms were raised regarding the united front work of the Chinese Communist Party. Liu Fei believes that in the past, in some places and departments, some Communist Party members were too involved in united front work, and the democratic parties often had a simple dependence on the United Front Work Department. Dan Maoxin said that whether the united front relationship is good or not is a matter for both parties, and he also criticized the work style of some Communist Party members.

Regarding the future work of the Democratic Revolutionary Committee, Li Renren believed that "the leaders of the Democratic Revolutionary Committee should have foresight in their future work and strive to take the initiative. The relationship between the central and local levels should be closer. Only by grasping more information can leadership be strengthened." Dan Maoxin said: "We must learn from the example of Communist Party members, dare to speak and dare to argue. We must go deep among the masses, reflect the opinions of the masses, represent the interests of the masses, and play a supervisory role."

Xinhua News Agency, July 6th. The Central Committee of the China Democratic League convened heads of the Democratic League from various regions on the afternoon of July 4th to discuss the policy of long-term coexistence and mutual supervision between the Chinese Communist Party and the democratic parties, and issues related to organizational work.

Shen Junru, Chairman of the Democratic League, and Vice Chairmen Zhang Bojun, Luo Longji, and Gao Chongmin all attended the symposium.

Vice Chairman Zhang Bojun spoke first, elaborating on the correctness of this major political policy from the needs of socialist revolution and socialist construction, as well as the development of the united front over the past 30 years. He also put forward suggestions on the future work of the Democratic League.

The heads of various regions spoke enthusiastically one after another. In their speeches, everyone unanimously expressed that they were encouraged by the policy of long-term coexistence and mutual supervision proposed by the CPC Central Committee, and also felt that the responsibilities of the democratic parties would be even greater in the future. They should strive to improve the organization and give play to the enthusiasm of each member in order to better serve socialism.

The symposium believed that among the members of the Democratic League, there are still many people who underestimate the role of the Democratic League and have the idea of not paying attention to the work of the League. In the future, ideological education of members should be further strengthened.

Participants exchanged views on how the organizational life of the Democratic League should be carried out on the premise of ensuring that senior intellectuals have six-fifths of their professional time. Some people believe that organizational life should be combined with the work of the members. Some local leaders said that many members, including individual local leaders, are unwilling to contact intermediate and backward masses, let alone absorb them into the League. This erroneous thinking must be strongly persuaded.

The heads of various regions also put forward suggestions on the leadership work of the Central Committee of the Democratic League, believing that the Central Committee was not timely enough in arranging work and handling problems, and hoped that the responsible comrades of the Central Committee could visit and guide work in various regions more often in the future.

Xinhua News Agency, July 6th. The China Association for Promoting Democracy held an enlarged meeting of the Central Standing Council on June 30th, and held a symposium on July 5th to discuss how to implement the spirit of the resolution of the Third Session of the National People's Congress.

At the enlarged meeting of the Central Standing Council, the issue of the long-term coexistence and mutual supervision between the Chinese Communist Party and the democratic parties proposed by the CPC Central Committee was emphasized in connection with the upcoming Second National Congress of the China Association for Promoting Democracy. The participants unanimously felt that the responsibilities of the democratic parties would be even greater in the future, and they must greatly strengthen their work and earnestly play the role of the democratic parties. Che Xiangchen said that the progress of the democratic parties is inseparable from the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. We should consciously and actively strive for the supervision and leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, and ask the Chinese Communist Party to point out the shortcomings and problems in our work at any time. Wu Yifang said that old intellectuals have more or less the old consciousness of "taking care of oneself" and "knowing when to stop", and often do not put forward opinions directly. Or when opinions are met with a little resistance, they retreat. Intellectuals are quick to understand problems theoretically, but it is not easy to put all their emotional strength into it. This shows that our sense of ownership is not enough, and it also shows that the democratic parties have a lot of work to do. Xu Guangping and Lei Jieqiong believe that the new situation has created favorable conditions for the democratic parties to carry out their work. Generally, intellectuals now have an urgent need to participate in political organizations. Some people have changed their past attitude of not paying attention to the democratic parties. The problem is that the democratic parties need to further improve the work of uniting, educating, and transforming intellectuals. In addition, the "Hundred Schools of Thought" policy was also discussed at the meeting.

At the symposium on July 5th, the issue of peaceful liberation of Taiwan was emphasized. Everyone unanimously believed that the possibility of peaceful liberation of Taiwan is growing, and the government's further proposal to hope that the Taiwan authorities will send representatives to start talks with us is wise and timely. The China Association for Promoting Democracy should strengthen the propaganda of liberating Taiwan through various means, mobilize people who have relationships with people in Taiwan to communicate with their relatives and friends in Taiwan, explain the government's policy of peaceful liberation of Taiwan, and strive for the early realization of the peaceful liberation of Taiwan.

The participants in these two meetings included Central Standing Council members of the China Association for Promoting Democracy and heads of various departments of the headquarters Ma Xulun, Wang Shao'ao, Zhou Jianren, Xu Guangping, Xu Boxin, Zhao Puchu, Ge Zhicheng, Yan Jingyao, Feng Binfu, Liang Chunfu, Jin Zhixuan, Zhang Jiyuan, Yu Zhijie, Wu Yanyin, and heads of local organizations participating in the Third Session of the National People's Congress in Beijing Che Xiangchen, Wu Yifang, Wu Ruoan, Yang Dongchun, etc.

    民革、民盟、民进中央分别举行座谈会
    交换对长期共存互相监督的意见
    新华社6日讯　中国国民党革命委员会中央委员会在七月四日上午召开座谈会，交换对中国共产党和各民主党派长期共存、互相监督的意见。
    所有参加座谈会的人，对中共中央提出的这项重大方针，表示极大的兴奋。陈绍宽说，“中共中央的这个方针给了我们很大的鼓舞和力量，我相信，民主党派的成员，今后将更加紧密地团结在共产党的周围，为社会主义建设贡献更大的力量。”刘斐说：“我以前一直以为，我国进入社会主义之后，剥削阶级消灭了，民主党派也就不存在，现在知道我的看法是错了。中共中央提出的这项方针，对于发挥社会主义民主，增加政治上和道德上的团结，会起很大的作用。”
    翁文灏和唐生智认为，过去几年来，民主党派在政治上有很大贡献。唐生智说，在湖南省，遇有重大措施，共产党和民主党派都作充分的协商，有不同意见就争论，而且时常争论，最后大家都按一致的结论去办事。
    翁文灏说，民主党派能不能发挥作用，本身工作的好坏也有很大关系。翁文灏的这个意见得到很多人赞同。钱昌照说：“民主党派只有保持自己身体的健康，才能够争取到长期共存。我认为民主党派必需从中央到地方，进行深入的检查，发现缺点并且清除缺点，在政治上提高责任心，在工作中提高严肃性。”
    座谈会上，对中国共产党的统一战线工作，提了一些意见和批评。刘斐认为：过去在某些地方和部门里，有些共产党员在统一战线工作方面过问的事情太多，而民主党派对统一战线工作部也往往存在单纯的依赖思想。但懋辛说，统一战线关系好不好，是两方面的事，他也对一些共产党员的工作作风提出了批评。
    对于民革今后的工作，李任仁认为“民革的领导人员对今后的工作应该有预见性，争取主动。中央和地方的关系应该更加密切，只有掌握更多的情况之后，领导才能加强。但懋辛说：“我们要学习共产党员的榜样，敢说敢争。要深入群众，反映群众的意见，代表群众的利益，发挥监督作用。”
    新华社6日讯　中国民主同盟中央委员会在七月四日下午召集民盟各地负责人，座谈中国共产党和各民主党派长期共存、互相监督的方针和组织工作问题。
    民盟主席沈钧儒，副主席章伯钧、罗隆基、高崇民等都出席了这个座谈会。
    章伯钧副主席首先发言，他从社会主义革命和社会主义建设的需要，以及三十多年来统一战线的发展情况，阐述了这个重大政治方针的正确性。并且对民盟今后的工作，提出了意见。
    各地方的负责人相继热烈发言。在发言中大家一致表示受到了中共中央提出的长期共存互相监督的方针的鼓舞，同时也感到今后民主党派的责任更加重大了，应该努力健全组织，发挥每个成员的积极性，以便更好地为社会主义服务。
    座谈会认为，民盟成员中，目前还有不少人对民盟的作用估计不足，存在着不重视盟的工作的思想，今后应进一步加强对成员的思想教育工作。
    参加座谈会的人就在保证高级知识分子有六分之五的业务时间的前提下，民盟的组织生活应如何进行问题交换了意见。有些人认为，组织生活应和盟员的业务相结合。有些地方负责人说，许多盟员，包括个别地方负责人，不愿意联系中间落后的群众，更不愿意吸收他们入盟。这种错误思想必须大力说服。
    各地方负责人还对民盟中央的领导工作提出了意见，认为中央对工作的布置和对问题的处理还不够及时，并希望今后中央负责同志能多多到地方视察、指导工作。
    新华社6日讯　中国民主促进会在六月三十日举行中央常务理事会扩大会议，七月五日又举行座谈会，讨论如何贯彻全国人民代表大会第三次会议决议的精神。
    在中央常务理事会扩大会议上，结合即将召开中国民主促进会第二次全国代表大会的问题着重讨论了中共中央所提出的中国共产党和各民主党派长期共存、互相监督的方针，参加会议的人一致感到今后民主党派责任更加重大，今后必须大大加强工作，认真地发挥民主党派的作用。车向忱说，民主党派的进步是和中国共产党的领导分不开的，我们应当自觉地主动地争取中国共产党的监督和领导，要求中国共产党随时指出我们工作中的缺点和毛病。吴贻芳说，旧知识分子多少带有“独善其身”、“适可而止”的旧意识，往往有意见不正面提。或者提意见稍遇阻力就退回来。知识分子从理论上认识问题是快的，可是要把感情力量全部投进去很不容易。这说明我们的主人翁感觉不够，同时也说明民主党派有许多工作可做。许广平、雷洁琼认为，新形势为民主党派开展工作创造了有利条件，一般知识分子现在都有着迫切参加政治组织的要求。有一些人已经改变了过去不重视民主党派的态度，问题是在于民主党派要进一步做好团结、教育、改造知识分子的工作。另外，会上对“百家争鸣”的方针也进行了讨论。
    在七月五日的座谈会上，着重讨论了关于和平解放台湾的问题。大家一致认为和平解放台湾的可能性正在增长，政府进一步提出希望台湾当局派遣代表和我们开始商谈的措施是英明的、及时的。中国民主促进会应当通过各种方式加强解放台湾的宣传，动员与台湾人员有关系的人和在台湾的亲友通信，解释政府和平解放台湾的政策，争取和平解放台湾早日实现。
    参加这两次会议的有中国民主促进会中央常务理事和总部各部门负责人马叙伦、王绍鏊、周建人、许广平、徐伯昕、赵朴初、葛志成、严景耀、冯宾符、梁纯夫、金芝轩、张纪元、余之介、吴研因和在京参加全国人民代表大会第三次会议的地方组织负责人车向忱、吴贻芳、吴若安、杨东莼等。
