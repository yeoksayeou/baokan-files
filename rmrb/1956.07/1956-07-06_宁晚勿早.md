    “Better Late Than Early”
    Shi Yin
    There is a type of problem that is almost universally known. No one can say it isn't a problem, but many people still haven't truly treated it as one. So, over time, they become accustomed to it, and the problem turns into a convention.
    I remember a satirical cartoon exhibition held in Yan'an in 1941. One cartoon in the exhibition was particularly eye-catching, titled "The Punctual Attendee." It depicted a person who arrived at a meeting on time, but the meeting room was empty, and his companion was a crow foraging for food. Fifteen years have passed, and we have long since moved from the countryside to the city. Our work is more intensive, and time is more precious. However, the problem raised by the satirical cartoon "The Punctual Attendee" still exists. On May 20, 1956, the State Council Personnel Bureau convened a meeting of personnel officers from relevant central departments. The notice stated that the meeting would begin at 8:00 AM, but the attendees didn't fully arrive until 8:50 AM. In another instance, a meeting was scheduled for 2:00 PM, but it didn't start until 3:00 PM. The leading comrade presiding over the meeting was the last to arrive. This situation is currently quite common and serious. The Zhengding County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Hebei Province notified its subordinate units to hold a mobilization meeting for advancing towards science and culture at 5:00 AM on June 2nd. The notice even specified that the meeting would start on time. Many cadres got up before dawn and rushed to the meeting venue. However, the gate of the venue was still locked, and it didn't open until 5:10 AM. Several hundred attendees had arrived, but the tables and loudspeakers on the rostrum were not yet set up. Some people raised objections to the county committee leadership, but the comrade in charge of the meeting actually replied, "This is a long-standing habit, and it cannot be changed all at once."
    Because many people have grasped this rule, those who convene meetings often "aim high" and deliberately set the meeting time earlier. And those attending the meetings "better late than early," often planning to arrive late.
    Now is a period of high tide, and everyone feels that their work is very busy, and everyone feels that they don't have enough time. Saving time is an urgent need for work and a common requirement for everyone. But who has calculated the cost of waste caused by not observing meeting times? Who has criticized those who are dilatory and arrive late, delaying everyone's time? If we don't calculate the costs, don't launch some criticism, and don't shout loudly at those who cling to the old habit of "better late than early," how can we change this habit? (Attached picture)

    “宁晚勿早”
    石因
    有一类问题，几乎是人所共知的，谁也不能说这不是问题，但是很多人仍然没有真正把它当作问题，于是久而久之，习以为常，问题变成了惯例。
    记得1941年在延安举行过一次讽刺画展，在画展中有一幅漫画很引人注意，题目是“准时到会的人”，画的是一个人准时参加了会议，但会场却空无一人，和他作伴的是一只正在觅食的乌鸦。十五年过去了，我们早已从农村进入了城市，工作更加紧张了，时间更加宝贵了。可是，“准时到会的人”这幅讽刺画提出的问题依然存在。1956年5月20日，国务院人事局召集中央有关部门的人事干事开会，通知上规定开会时间是八时，而开会的人到八时五十分才到齐；另一次会议，原定召开的时间是下午二时，结果到三时才到齐。主持会议的领导同志则是最后到来的一个。而这种情况在目前是比较普遍而严重的。中共河北省正定县委会通知所属各单位于六月二日上午五时召开向科学文化进军的动员大会，通知上还写明准时开会，许多干部天没有大亮就起身，赶到会场。但会场的大门还锁着，到五时十分才开门；出席会议的好几百人都到齐了，但主席台上的桌子和扩音器还没有布置好，有人对县委领导上提出意见，主持会议的负责同志居然答道：“这是长期养成的习惯，不能一下子改掉。”
    由于很多人都摸到了这条规律，召集会议的人就“取法乎上”，常常把开会时间有意识地提早。而参加会议的人则“宁晚勿早”，常常有计划地迟到。
    现在，是高潮时期，大家都感到工作非常忙，也都感到时间不够。节省时间，是工作所迫切需要，也是大家的共同要求。可是谁给不遵守开会时间造成的浪费算过一笔细帐，谁对那些耽搁大家时间姗姗来迟的人提出过批评？如果不算一算细帐，不展开一下批评，不向那些抱着“宁晚勿早”的老例的人大喝一声，怎么能改变这种习惯呢？（附图片）
