    "Estimation is more accurate than statistics" – this saying is quite popular among rural cadres in the Nenjiang Special District of Heilongjiang Province, and has even become a widely accepted fact. Recently, when this reporter visited Nehe County, Wang Wenquan, Deputy Secretary of the County Party Committee, gave an example to illustrate: "Estimation is indeed more accurate than statistics." He said that according to the comprehensive statistics reported by all cooperatives in the county, the area of cultivated land fertilized this year has reached 67.5% of the total cultivated land area, exceeding the 65% target set by the County Party Committee. However, in reality, according to a more accurate estimate made through typical investigations, it is only a little over 50%.
    This spring, 97% of farm households in Nehe County joined advanced cooperatives. Every cooperative and production team has full-time or part-time statisticians, so in principle, statistical work should be much more accurate than in the past. Why is it that "statistics are not as accurate as estimation?" Some responsible cadres of the County Party Committee, in answering my question, said: The figures reported to us from below all contain a lot of "moisture." What is "moisture?" It is a euphemism for false figures. To be precise, a trend of making false reports is growing among grassroots cadres in rural areas. This trend has reached such a serious extent that "a grassroots branch secretary dared to say that the whole cooperative had fertilized more than 200 hectares of land when it only had 50 hectares when the County Party Secretary came to the cooperative to inspect the work."
    In order to find out the reasons for the prevalence of false reports, the reporter specifically interviewed some township cadres. They believe that the main reasons for this shortcoming are: the higher-level leading organs subjectively and blindly put forward excessively high plans and requirements to the lower levels, and do not effectively help farmers to realize them. As a result, some grassroots cadres came up with this little idea: "Report a little more to make up for not completing the plan, so as to avoid criticism." For example, digging wells for irrigation is still a pioneering undertaking in the history of this county, and farmers have no experience at all. This spring, the county's leading organs suddenly proposed a plan to dig 2,000 wells throughout the county. Many grassroots cadres who disagreed with digging a large number of wells were criticized for having "conservative thinking." Later, "conservative thinking" was overcome, and a mass upsurge of well-digging was also set off. However, some cooperatives were perfunctory, and some dug only a few feet deep and called it a well. Many cooperatives, although they sincerely accepted the plan after persuasion and education, and even mobilized their members to dig wells overnight with lanterns, also dug a large number of useless wells due to the lack of necessary technical guidance from the leading organs. According to recent statistics, cooperatives throughout the county reported that they had dug more than 1,700 wells, but according to investigations, only about 700 are actually usable. Due to the waste of a lot of labor and timber, many cooperative members are now full of complaints, blaming the leading organs for being "rash." Taking fertilization as another example, according to the county's records from 1950 to 1955, the annual plan for applying base fertilizer to cultivated land accounted for 45% to 55% of the total cultivated land area, while the actual achievement each year was about 30%. This year, the County Party Committee again proposed a plan to fertilize 70% (later changed to 65%) of the area, and since it did not effectively help farmers find sources of manure, it naturally could not be completed. Although some cooperatives completed the percentage, the amount of fertilizer applied per hectare was less than half of what the County Party Committee required. As a result, some grassroots cadres criticized the leading organs, saying: "The plan is spoken with the mouth and written on paper," "There is a plan every year, but it is never completed, there are targets for everything, but most of them fall through."
    Some county and district leading cadres like to hear good news but not bad news, and they do not go deep into reality to do meticulous investigation and research work, which is also an important reason for encouraging false reports. Chen Huanyun, the head of Xiangyang Township, told the reporter a story: At a reporting meeting convened by the District Party Committee, a cooperative cadre lied about his production achievements and was praised on the spot, while another cadre who reported his production achievements truthfully was severely criticized. Not long ago, at an award ceremony for the production increase competition in Nannan Township, the "Fanrong" and "Yaorong" cooperatives were about the same in terms of production progress and cultivation quality, but the latter falsely reported that the fertilization area had reached 86%, while the former only reported 60%. Seeing that the township cadres were about to hand over the red flag to the "Yaorong" cooperative, the representative of the "Fanrong" cooperative quickly stood up and exposed the false report of the "Yaorong" cooperative, and only then did he win back the red flag.
    The harm of false reports is becoming more and more obvious. A few days before the Grain in Ear season, all cooperatives in the county reported to the county that all the land had been sown. However, after checking after the Grain in Ear season, it was found that more than 1,000 hectares of land had not been sown. As a result, the county's leading organs had to mobilize the cooperatives again to plant late autumn crops on these lands, which affected the timely completion of the sowing plan. In order to overcome the bad practice of false reports, the county's leading organs have criticized it at several rural cadre meetings and have made several decisions to improve the style of leadership, but because the transformation of the style of leadership has not been resolute and thorough enough, the practice of false reports has not been eliminated. According to a recent survey by the County Party Committee's Rural Work Department of the statistics reported by various cooperatives on more than 80,000 hectares of land in the county that suffered wind disasters, about one-third of the reported disasters were false, according to a relatively reliable estimate.

    为什么说估计比统计准确
    新华社记者  任永达
    “估计比统计准确”，这句话在黑龙江省嫩江专区的农村干部中颇为流行，甚至已经成为人们公认的事实了。最近记者到讷河县访问，中共县委副书记汪文泉还举例说明：“估计的确比统计准”。他说，这个县今年耕地的施肥面积按全县合作社上报的统计数字综合：已达耕地面积的67.5％，超过了县委提出的65％的指标；而实际上，据典型调查做出的较准确的估计：仅仅有50％多些。
    讷河县今春97％的农户加入了高级社。每个社和生产队都有脱产或兼职统计员，按理说统计工作应该比过去准确得多。这是为什么“统计倒不如估计准确了呢？”县委的一些负责干部在回答我的问题时说：我们下面报来的数字都有很大“水分”。什么是“水分”呢？原来它是虚假数字的代名词，确切点说：农村基层干部中有一种喜欢做假报告的风气在滋长。这种风气已经到了这样严重的程度：“一个基层支部书记竟敢在县委书记到社检查工作时，把全社本有五十公顷土地上了粪，说成了有二百多公顷”。
    为了弄清假报告盛行的原因，记者特地访问了一些乡干部。他们认为产生这个缺点的原因主要是：上级领导机关主观、盲目地向下面提出过高的计划和要求，而且又不切实地帮助农民实现。于是，一些基层干部就产生了这个小主意：“完不成计划多报点，免得挨批评”。例如，打井浇地在这个县的历史上还是创举，农民没有一点经验。今春县的领导机关突然提出了全县打井两千眼的计划。许多不同意大量打井的基层干部都被批评有“保守思想”。后来“保守思想”克服了，群众性的打井热潮也掀起了。可是，有些社应付差事，有的挖几尺深的土坑就算一眼井；有不少社虽然经过说服教育，诚心接受了计划，甚至发动社员带着灯笼连夜打井，但由于领导机关缺乏必要的技术指导，也同样打出了大量废井。据最近的统计：全县合作社上报共打出了一千七百多眼井，而据调查真正可用的只有七百眼左右。由于浪费了大量人工和木材，现在许多合作社社员牢骚满腹，埋怨领导机关“冒进”了。再以施肥为例，据这个县从1950年到1955年的资料记载，每年耕地施底肥的计划都占耕地总面积的45％到55％，而实际逐年达到的都在30％左右。今年县委又提出了施肥面积达70％（后改为65％）的计划，加上又没有切实地帮助农民找粪源，自然又不能完成。有些社虽然百分数完成了，但每公顷的施肥量都不足县委要求的半数。于是，一些基层干部便批评领导机关说：“计划说在嘴上，订在纸上”，“年年有计划，年年完不成，项项有指标，大部都落空”。
    一些县、区领导干部喜欢听喜不听忧，又不深入实际做细致的调查研究工作，也是助长假报告的一个重要原因。向阳乡乡长陈涣云告诉记者一个故事：在一次区委召集的汇报会上，有一个社干部谎报了生产成绩，当场受到了表扬，而另一个实报生产成绩的干部却遭到了严励的批评。不久前，在讷南乡的一次增产竞赛评奖会上，“繁荣”和“耀荣”两个社在生产进度、耕作质量上都差不多，而后者谎报了施肥面积已达86％，前者只有60％。眼看着乡干部要把红旗交给“耀荣”社了，“繁荣”社的代表赶紧起来揭发了“耀荣”社的假报告，才把红旗夺过来。
    假报告的危害越来越明显了。芒种的前几天，全县各社给县里的报告说：全部土地都种完了。可是芒种过后一检查，还发现一千多公顷土地没有撒进种子。于是，县领导机关只好再发动合作社在这些地里种晚秋作物，影响了播种计划按时完成。为了克服假报告这个坏风气，县的领导机关已经在多次农村干部会议上批判过，对改进领导作风也做出了若干决定，但由于领导作风的转变还不够坚决和彻底，假报告的风气也就没有消除。据最近县委农村工作部从各社上报的全县八万多公顷土地受风灾的统计中调查，根据比较可靠的估计，大约有三分之一是谎报的灾情。
