Random Sketches from Xiang and Guangxi - Part 4
The Xiang-Li Divide
Hu Peihang

On my way back east from Guilin, I made a detour to Xing'an County to visit the Qin Dyke. This dyke was built during the time of Emperor Qin Shi Huang when he was campaigning against the Baiyue people. The imperial supervisor, Shi Lu, had a canal dug to transport grain. It has remained intact for thousands of years and is truly a precious historical site. Passing through Sujia Bridge and Xiaotianping from the Qin Dyke, I arrived at the "Xiang-Li Divide." There is a pavilion here for distant views, and next to the pavilion are two stone tablets, one inscribed with the four characters "Traces of Fubo" and the other with the four characters "Xiang-Li Divide." To the right of the pavilion, the Li River flows south, and to the left, the Xiang River flows north. In front of the pavilion, the two rivers connect, but without any mixing, which is quite extraordinary.

The mountains here are towering, majestic, and beautiful. They are the basis for the ancient large-scale blue-green landscape paintings. The trees are mostly old willows with twisted and varied branches, making them extremely interesting subjects for sketching. (Attached picture)

    湘桂写生随感之四
    湘漓分界
    胡佩衡
    由桂林东归，顺道到兴安县去参观秦堤。这个堤，是秦始皇的时候，伐百粤，御史监军史禄凿渠运粮而成，数千年来并未损坏，真是宝贵的古迹。从秦堤经过苏家桥、小天坪，到了“湘漓分界处”。这地方有一亭可远眺，亭旁有石碣二个，一刻“伏波遗迹”四大字，一刻“湘漓分派”四大字。亭右漓江水向南流，亭左湘江水向北流，亭前两水相通，可是毫不紊乱，甚是奇异。
    此处高山耸峙，雄伟奇丽，就是古人大青绿画的根据，树木多老柳，枝干曲折变化，是极有趣的写生对象。（附图片）
