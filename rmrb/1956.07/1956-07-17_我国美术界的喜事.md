A piece of good news for China's art world:

    After the Central Academy of Fine Arts Affiliated Secondary Art School announced in the China Youth Daily that it would be enrolling seven-year students this semester, young art enthusiasts from all over the country eagerly applied. Over 15,000 elementary school graduates applied. Many of the children who applied showed artistic talent, but due to limited spaces, only 200 were approved to take the exam. The two-day examination was held on July 12th and 13th, and 40 students will be admitted. They will receive excellent training after enrollment.

    Ren Yu, an eleven-year-old, is the youngest of all the examinees. She paints quickly and well. The left picture shows her working on the test paper during the exam. The right picture is one of her creative paintings. The content of the painting is "A Meaningful Event." The painting depicts two Young Pioneers helping a little girl return home in a thunderstorm.
