    Turpan's "Seedless White" Grapes
    Tao Ye
    Whether you buy white raisins in Beijing, Shanghai, or elsewhere, they all come from one place – the Turpan Basin in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region. This is our country's only high-quality raisin production area at present.
    The Turpan Basin in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region includes the three counties of Turpan, Shanshan (the famous Hami melon production area), and Toksun. Although this basin is located on the northwestern plateau at an altitude of 1,000-3,000 meters, its surface is below sea level. The temperature here is very high (the average temperature in July is 92 degrees Fahrenheit), the climate is dry, and the annual rainfall is only about 20 mm. However, in areas where grape cultivation is concentrated, there is ample spring water for irrigation. Turpan Basin's ability to cultivate seedless white grapes and dry high-quality raisins is inseparable from this special natural condition.
    The grapes in the Turpan Basin are mainly concentrated in Turpan and Shanshan counties. The grapes in Turpan are concentrated in Grape Valley, Shahezi, and Tao'ergou, and the grapes in Shanshan are concentrated in Tuyigou, Xiligen, and Handao. The two counties have more than 20,000 mu of grapes. Among them, Grape Valley in Turpan County has the most concentrated cultivation and the largest area. Grape Valley is a narrow strip of land with a total area of more than 5,000 mu, almost all of which is grape land. The grapes cultivated in the Turpan Basin are mostly "Seedless White" grapes, in addition to a small number of red and green mare's nipple grapes, black grapes, and Suosuo grapes. The two counties produce more than 5 million jin of "Seedless White" raisins annually.
    The method of grape cultivation in Turpan is very different from that in the interior. The number of plants planted per mu is about 12. The plant spacing is about 1 zhang and 5 chi, and the row spacing is about 3 zhang. The Turpan Basin is windy in spring. In order to avoid wind damage, the grape vines are not immediately placed on the trellis after they emerge from the soil. Around the beginning of June, when the grapes grow to the size of peas, they are placed on the trellis. The height of the trellis in the interior is generally more than 4 chi, but the trellis here is only 1 chi and a half to 2 chi high. According to local farmers, if the trellis is too high, it will not only affect the yield, but also reduce the quality.
    The method of grape propagation here is also different from other places. The method of propagation here is to bury bundles of branches about 1 chi and a half long (15-20 branches per bundle) in the soil (with one-quarter exposed above the ground), and they can bear fruit in four to five years. Because many cuttings are used for propagation, many branches and vines will sprout later.
    "Seedless White" grapes mature very early, harvesting begins in early to mid-July, and can be completed in late July or early August.
    The method of making raisins in Turpan is carried out in a specially built house. This type of house is called "qun zha" in Uyghur. The "qun zha" is built of adobe, with gaps left in the walls for air to circulate freely. The roof is the same as ordinary houses, and a door is left on one side of the wall for access. The "qun zha" are mostly built on the rocky slopes of the Gobi Desert, very close to where the grapes are planted. The "qun zha" built here, because of the high temperature and good ventilation, is simply a natural oven. The grapes are placed inside and hung on specially made drying racks, and after about forty days, they turn into raisins.
    The yield of grapes in the Turpan Basin has increased significantly since liberation. In 1955, the grapes in the Turpan Basin had an unprecedented bumper harvest. The average yield of grapes in the two main production areas, Grape Valley and Shahezi, was 1,700 jin per mu, which could be dried into 340 jin of raisins, about twice as high as before liberation. Before liberation, the Liberation Grape Production Cooperative's yield per mu was only 170-180 jin (raisins). In 1955, the average reached 396.4 jin, including eight mu of high-yield land, each mu of which dried 714 jin of raisins.
    This year, the grape production technology in the Turpan Basin has been improved compared to last year. The time for opening the mounds has been advanced, pruning and fertilization have also been more timely than last year, and the amount of fertilizer applied has also increased. The grapes in the Turpan Basin are going to have another bumper harvest this year. (Supplied by the Ministry of Agriculture)

    吐鲁番的“无核白”葡萄
    陶冶
    不论在北京、上海或者其他地方买到的白葡萄干，都是来自一个地方——新疆维吾尔自治区的吐鲁番盆地。这是我们祖国目前唯一的质量优良的葡萄干产区。
    新疆维吾尔自治区的吐鲁番盆地，包括吐鲁番、鄯善（即著名的哈密瓜产区）和托克逊三个县。这个盆地虽然在海拔1000—3000公尺的西北高原上，但是它的地面却低于海平面。这里的气温很高，（七月平均温度为华氏92度）气候干燥，年雨量仅20公厘左右。但是在葡萄栽培集中的地区，却有充足的泉水可以灌溉。吐鲁番盆地能够栽培无核白葡萄和晒制质量很好的葡萄干，是和这个特殊的自然条件分不开的。
    吐鲁番盆地的葡萄，主要集中在吐鲁番和鄯善两个县。吐鲁番的葡萄集中在葡萄沟、砂河子、桃儿沟，鄯善的葡萄集中在吐以沟、西里根和汉道。两县葡萄约两万多亩。其中以吐鲁番县的葡萄沟栽培最集中，面积也比别处大。葡萄沟是一个狭长地带，总面积五千多亩，几乎全部是葡萄地。吐鲁番盆地栽培的葡萄，绝大部分为“无核白”葡萄，此外还有少数的红、绿马奶葡萄、黑葡萄、索索葡萄等。两县年产“无核白”葡萄干500多万斤。
    吐鲁番葡萄栽培的方法和内地大不相同。每亩地栽植株数为12株左右。株距约一丈五尺，行距约三丈。吐鲁番盆地春季多风，为了避免风害，葡萄枝蔓出土以后，并不及时上架，大约在六月上旬，葡萄长到碗豆粒大的时候，才把它架在支架上。内地支架的高度，一般都在四尺以上，可是这里的支架仅高一尺半到二尺。据当地农民说：如果支架过高，不但影响产量，而且品质也要降低。
    这里葡萄的繁殖方法也和其他地方不同。这里繁殖的方法是把一尺半左右的成捆的（每捆15—20支）枝条，埋插土里（露出地面四分之一），四—五年即可结果。因为扦插用的插条多，日后萌发的枝蔓也多。
      “无核白”葡萄成熟期很早，七月上、中旬开始采收，七月下旬或八月上旬即可收取完毕。
    吐鲁番葡萄制干的方法是在一种特建的房屋里进行的。这种房屋维语叫做“群扎”。“群扎”是用土坯垒成，墙上留有空隙，空气可以自由流通，房顶和普通房屋一样，墙的一面，留有门户以便出入。“群扎”多半建在距离栽植葡萄很近的戈壁的岩石山坡上。在这里修建的“群扎”，因为温度很高，同时通风良好，简直成了一个天然的烤箱。葡萄放进去挂在特制的干燥架上，大约有四十天，就变成葡萄干了。
    吐鲁番盆地葡萄的产量，在解放以后有了显著的提高。1955年吐鲁番盆地的葡萄获得空前的丰收，主要产区葡萄沟和砂河子两个乡的葡萄平均每亩产1，700斤，可以晒葡萄干340斤，比解放前高约一倍。解放葡萄生产合作社，解放前每亩产量仅仅170—180斤（葡萄干）。1955年平均达到396.4斤，其中有八亩丰产地，每亩晒制了714斤葡萄干。
    今年吐鲁番盆地的葡萄生产技术比去年又有改进。开墩的时间提早了，修剪、施肥也都比去年及时，施肥量也有增加。吐鲁番盆地的葡萄今年又要丰收了。（农业部供稿）
