Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 24th. More than 20,000 agricultural production cooperatives in the Qin Chuan area of ​​Shaanxi Province are storing and exchanging wheat seeds that are full of grains, high in purity, and have not been rained on. In Dali and Tongguan counties of Weinan Prefecture, where the summer harvest pre-distribution work was carried out earlier, many agricultural cooperatives have already stored enough good wheat seeds needed for autumn sowing. Agricultural cooperatives in Liquan, Qianxian, Xingping, and Wugong counties have reserved all 700,000 mu of wheat that has not been rained on as seeds. In addition to reserving enough good wheat seeds needed for autumn sowing, the Hongxing No. 5 Agricultural Cooperative in Huaxian County has also decided to transfer a portion of the surplus good wheat seeds to other agricultural cooperatives lacking seeds. The summer harvest pre-distribution work in Mei County, Fengxiang, and Qishan, and the five counties and cities of Baoji Prefecture was carried out relatively late, and the work of agricultural cooperatives in storing and exchanging wheat seeds is now starting one after another.

The Qin Chuan area is one of the high-yield wheat areas in the country. The more than 16 million mu of wheat sown in this area last autumn were basically high-quality varieties. During this year's summer harvest, some wheat was exposed to rain, sprouted, and went moldy. Some agricultural cooperatives, due to insufficient manpower, did not carry out single harvesting and threshing during the rush harvest, and the seeds left were relatively mixed. In order to create conditions for increasing wheat production next year, the Party and government leading organs in this area have mobilized agricultural cooperatives to store and exchange good wheat seeds. Many agricultural technology promotion stations in Weinan and Baoji Prefectures and the suburbs of Xi'an City have also helped agricultural cooperatives to conduct wheat seed germination tests. The Shaanxi Provincial Department of Agriculture plans to take out more than 30 million jin of "Bi Ma No. 1" wheat seeds from its inventory, and send two working groups to purchase another 30 million jin of good wheat seeds to exchange them for agricultural cooperatives that have suffered heavier rain disasters and lack seeds.

    夏收期间部分小麦受潮和品种混杂
    秦川地区农业社注意选留好麦种
    新华社西安24日电　陕西省秦川地区的二万多个农业生产合作社，正在留存和掉换颗粒饱满、纯度大和没有受到雨淋的麦种。在渭南专区夏收预分工作进行得比较早的大荔和潼关两县，许多农业社已经留够了秋季播种时需要的好麦种。醴泉、乾县、兴平和武功等县的农业社已经把没有受到雨淋的七十万亩麦子，全部留作为种子。华县红星第五农业社除留够秋季播种时需要的好麦种外，还决定把多余的一部分好麦种调剂给其他缺种的农业社。宝鸡专区郿县、凤翔、岐山等五县、市的夏收预分工作进行得比较晚，农业社留存和掉换麦种的工作目前正在陆续开始。
    秦川地区是全国小麦高产区之一。去年秋天这个地区播种的一千六百多万亩小麦，基本上都是优良品种。今年夏收期间，一部分麦子遭受雨淋，发芽霉坏。有些农业社因为人力不足，在抢收中没有进行单收单打，留下的种子比较混杂。为了给明年小麦增产创造条件，这个地区的党、政领导机关就发动农业社留存和掉换好麦种。渭南、宝鸡两专区和西安市郊区许多农业技术推广站还帮助农业社普遍进行麦种发芽试验。陕西省农业厅计划拿出库存的三千多万斤“碧蚂一号”麦种，并且派出两个工作组准备再收购三千万斤好麦种，掉换给遭受雨灾较重和缺种的农业社。
