In April and May, a dispute arose between the Jiaxing Municipal Company of the China Monopoly Corporation and the Jiaxing Municipal Local State-Owned Distillery over the purchase of white liquor. The reason was that the white liquor produced by the Jiaxing Distillery contained 0.07% methanol (toxin) and exceeded 0.03 milligrams per liter of lead. The former Ministry of Commerce and the former Ministry of Local Industry had jointly stipulated that the methanol content in white liquor should not exceed 0.04% and the lead content should not exceed 0.03 milligrams per liter. The Jiaxing Municipal Company believed that the methanol and lead content of the white liquor from the Jiaxing Distillery exceeded the national standards and could not be purchased under any circumstances. However, the Jiaxing Distillery argued that the contract signed by both parties did not specify the content of methanol and lead, so the Jiaxing Municipal Company must purchase it regardless.

In early May, the Jiaxing Municipal Planning Commission, the Industry Department of the Jiaxing Municipal Party Committee, and other units held a special meeting on this matter. After debate, the meeting finally decided that the Jiaxing Municipal Company should purchase the white liquor. According to a comrade from the Industry Department of the Jiaxing Municipal Party Committee, the reason for this decision was twofold: first, the contract signed between the Jiaxing Distillery and the Jiaxing Municipal Company only stipulated that the liquor should be white, fragrant, and guaranteed to have a concentration of 46%, without explicitly specifying the methanol and lead content. Since there were no such provisions, and the liquor met the requirements of being white, fragrant, and 46% concentration, the Jiaxing Municipal Company should act according to the contract—purchase it. Second, many farmers could not buy liquor, and in order to meet consumer needs, the Jiaxing Municipal Company should also purchase it.

The Jiaxing Municipal Company implemented the decision of the meeting and purchased the substandard white liquor, but the problem was not resolved. The Jiaxing Distillery continued to produce liquor without regard to quality. Because white liquor with a methanol content exceeding 0.04% and a lead content exceeding 0.03 milligrams per liter is harmful to health, and excessive consumption can lead to blindness, hotels, retailers, and consumers who bought this liquor frequently demanded returns. Supply and marketing cooperatives also refused to purchase it. By the end of May, the Jiaxing Municipal Company had only completed 36% of its second-quarter sales plan for white liquor. Because it could not be sold, the Jiaxing Municipal Company firmly refused to purchase the white liquor, while the Jiaxing Distillery, citing the decision made by the meeting convened by the Municipal Planning Commission and the Industry Department of the Municipal Party Committee, felt justified and sent people to the Jiaxing Municipal Company every day to argue and demand the purchase.

The decision made by the meeting convened by the Jiaxing Municipal Planning Commission and the Industry Department of the Jiaxing Municipal Party Committee was clearly incorrect. Liquor is a beverage, unlike washbasins and teacups: if the quality of washbasins and teacups is slightly inferior and does not fully meet the standards, it is permissible to lower the price and sell them; however, white liquor containing toxins is harmful to people's health. The Jiaxing Municipal Planning Commission and the Industry Department of the Jiaxing Municipal Party Committee did not give sufficient consideration to the health of consumers, and were not responsible enough to the consumers. This decision accommodated the backward state of the Jiaxing Distillery, and therefore did not play a role in promoting the improvement of product quality in the factory.

How to resolve this unfinished dispute? As the saying goes, "He who tied the bell must untie it." The meeting convened by the Jiaxing Municipal Planning Commission and the Industry Department of the Jiaxing Municipal Party Committee made an inappropriate decision, causing bad results, and now it should also be resolved by them. The poor quality of the white liquor from the Jiaxing Distillery is the cause of the dispute. To fundamentally eliminate the dispute, the most important thing is to urge and help them improve the quality of the white liquor.

    解铃还要系铃人

    四、五月间，中国专买事业公司嘉兴市公司同嘉兴市地方国营酒厂，为收购白酒的问题发生了争执。原因是嘉兴酒厂生产的白酒，含甲醇（毒素）0.07％，含铅量超过0.03毫克升。中央商业部和原地方工业部曾经共同规定：白酒里含的甲醇，最高不得超过0.04％，含铅量也不得超过0.03毫克升。嘉兴市公司认为嘉兴酒厂的白酒的甲醇和铅的含量都超过了国家标准，无论如何不能收购。而嘉兴酒厂呢，则认为双方签订的合同里，没有规定甲醇和铅的含量，所以无论如何一定要嘉兴市公司收购。
    五月上旬，嘉兴市计划委员会、中共嘉兴市委工业部等单位为此专门开了会。会议经过争论，最后决定嘉兴市公司收购白酒。据中共嘉兴市委工业部的一位同志说，这次会议所以作这个决定，有两点理由：一是嘉兴酒厂和嘉兴市公司签订的合同里只规定：酒要白、要香、浓度保证46％，至于甲醇和含铅量多少，没有明确规定。既然没有规定，而酒又符合白、香和46％浓度的要求，嘉兴市公司就应该按合同办事——收购。二是很多农民买不到酒喝，为了满足消费者需要，嘉兴市公司也应该收购。
    嘉兴市公司执行会议决定，把不合国家标准的白酒收购下来了，但是，问题并没有从此了结。嘉兴酒厂仍然不顾质量地生产。因为甲醇含量超过0.04％和含铅量超过0.03毫克升的白酒有碍健康，多饮以后眼睛会失明的，所以酒店、零售商和消费者，买到这种酒以后，纷纷要求退货。供销合作社也拒绝进货。到五月底止，嘉兴市公司白酒的销售计划仅仅完成第二季度计划的36％。因为销不出去，嘉兴市公司又坚决拒绝收购白酒，而嘉兴酒厂则认为市计划委员会和市委工业部召开的会议已经作出决定，理直气壮，天天派人到嘉兴市公司去吵架，要求收购。
    嘉兴市计划委员会、中共嘉兴市委工业部召集的会议所作的决定，显然是不对的。酒是一种饮料，跟脸盆、茶杯不一样：脸盆、茶杯质量次一些，不完全合乎标准，降低价格出售，还是允许的；而含有毒素的白酒则是损害人们健康的。嘉兴市计划委员会和中共嘉兴市委工业部，对消费者的健康问题，至少是考虑不够的，对消费者是不够负责的。这个决定迁就了嘉兴酒厂的落后状况，因而也没有起到推动该厂改进产品质量的作用。
    怎样解决这个未了的纠纷呢？俗话说得好：“解铃还要系铃人”。嘉兴市计划委员会、中共嘉兴市委工业部召开的会议作了不妥当的决定，引起了不好的结果，现在也应由他们来解决好一些。嘉兴酒厂的白酒质量不好，是引起争论的原因，要根本消除争论，最主要的还是督促和帮助他们提高白酒质量。
