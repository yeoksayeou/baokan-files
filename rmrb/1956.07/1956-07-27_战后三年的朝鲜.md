    Korea Three Years After the War
    By July 27th of this year, the sounds of artillery fire in Korea had ceased for three years. Now, on this land that has suffered so much from the ravages of war, the peaceful labor of the Korean people has borne rich fruit. The Three-Year Plan (1954-56) is about to be completed ahead of schedule, and it is estimated that this year's total industrial output value will exceed that of 1949 by more than 80%. Factories, cities, and rural areas that were severely damaged in the war have been rebuilt at a rapid pace. The Korean people, who established heroic achievements in the war against aggression, have created miracles in production and construction.

      Recovering Quickly and Well

    Not long ago, I visited the famous Hungnam Fertilizer Factory in Korea, which is currently being restored. During the war, an average of one bomb fell within every six square meters of this factory. The tall factory buildings were reduced to rubble covered with bullet marks. The factory site became a ruin, overgrown with weeds taller than a person. As soon as the armistice was signed, the workers immediately and urgently began restoration work. After the workers' arduous efforts, by May of last year, the snow-white ammonium sulfate fertilizer they produced was once again available to farmers after the war. One kilogram of this fertilizer can increase rice production by 1.75 kilograms.
    The factory now has production equipment restored to a scale capable of producing 100,000 tons of ammonium sulfate fertilizer annually. The restored production equipment has been upgraded with new technologies and performs even better than before. By 1958, the factory will reach and exceed pre-war levels, producing more than 400,000 tons.
    In the three years since the war, like the Hungnam Fertilizer Factory, 236 large and medium-sized factories and enterprises in North Korea have been fully or partially restored, and they have been built even better than before. In addition, 71 new large and medium-sized factories have been built. The No. 1 blast furnace of the Kim Chaek Iron Works, after being restored last year, produces twice as much pig iron every day as it did before liberation. The 50-ton open-hearth furnace at the Hwanghae Iron Works has been expanded into a 100-ton open-hearth furnace. The restored Pyongyang Textile Factory has more than doubled its equipment and output compared to the pre-war period.

  Unprecedented in Korean History

    At an industrial exhibition held in Pyongyang, people crowded around to watch a brand-new, shiny lathe demonstrating the turning of machine parts. This is a new product of the Huichon Machine Factory, built in Korea after the war with the assistance of fraternal countries, and it is also the first lathe ever produced in Korean history. This factory can produce more than 1,800 lathes every year. Before liberation, Korea's machinery industry accounted for only 1.6% of the total industrial output value. At that time, even a single part for a textile machine had to be purchased from Japan. However, in the short few years since the war, lathes, drilling machines, and planers have been manufactured. No wonder so many Koreans are interested in this lathe.
    In 1955, Korea's machinery industry already accounted for 17.9% of the total industrial output value. Now, workers in various factories are engaged in labor competitions using domestically produced lathes. Miners are using domestically produced rock drills, belt conveyors, and ball mills to exploit Korea's rich underground mineral resources. Railway workers are laying roads with domestically produced steel rails, fishermen are using Korean-made motorboats to fish, and farmers are using domestically produced pumps that can pump sixty tons of water per minute to irrigate their fields. These are all things that have never happened before in history.
    Before liberation, there was not even one textile factory in North Korea. Now, textile factories such as the Pyongyang Textile Factory have been built after the war.
    The colorful enamelware produced by the newly built Sinuiju Enamel Factory after the war has gradually replaced the copper bowls and copper basins that Koreans used to use. The cannery to be built in the Sinpo fishing port will process mackerel and sea crabs, specialties of the Korean East Coast, into canned goods for sale at home and abroad. More and more things that have never happened before in Korean history are emerging.

      Victory in Transforming Nature

    When the South Pyongan Province Irrigation Project was completed, we visited this famous project that transforms alkaline land into fertile soil, a victory in transforming nature.
    Climbing the high mountain next to the Yonpung Reservoir, one can see the spectacular sight of connecting the waters of the Taedong River and the Chongchon River to irrigate the fields. A 34-meter-high, 240-meter-long concrete dam in the Yonpung area has created a 16-kilometer-long valley reservoir. The waters of the Taedong River and the Chongchon River flowing from the reservoir converge in a man-made river, the main canal of the irrigation project, which is 25 meters wide. The waters of the two rivers, with white waves, flow majestically along the main and branch canals, which are more than 840 kilometers long, to the vast fields.
    The Japanese began to build this project in 1918. They worked on it for more than 20 years, and only completed 18% of the total project before they left Korea. Later, even this was destroyed by the war. The Korean people completed it in two years after the war. In the difficult days after the war, the government of the republic mobilized enormous resources to build this project. The waters of the two rivers flowed into more than 30,000 chongbo (one chongbo is approximately 15 Chinese mu) of rice paddies during rice transplanting this year, and will increase rice production in this area by approximately 60,000 tons.
    The waters of the two rivers flow all the way into the "Twelve or Thirteen Thousand Li Plain." This famous plain, spanning four counties, is a vast expanse of white alkaline land. There are no mountains, no rivers, and not even a single tree grows. Now the waters of the two rivers have brought life to this plain. Last year, the completion of the Kumsong Pumping Station doubled the rice production here, and this year they will increase production by another 50% compared to last year. New houses are being built everywhere on the plain. In Yongrim-ri, Mundok County, 84 new houses were built from last winter to this spring. Due to the arrival of new immigrants, the population of this village has also doubled. Water has brought about earth-shaking changes to this plain, and the people here call the water from the South Pyongan Province Irrigation Project "water of life."

  Pyongyang Rebuilt from Ruins

    The first time I went to Pyongyang was on a night during the war. The jeep drove onto the asphalt road in the city, which was full of bomb craters and machine gun bullet marks. Under the cold moonlight, the city was full of ruins and piles of rubble.
    Pyongyang has changed a lot in the three years since the war. Now, standing on the streets of Pyongyang, I can see newly built, wide and flat roads extending in all directions. Many new high-rise buildings have been built on both sides of the roads: counting from Stalin Road from north to south, the Moranbong Theater hidden in the green trees, the five-story workers' dormitory building with a Korean-style pavilion on the roof, the two office buildings of the Joint Cabinet Office, the International Hotel, and the Academy of Sciences, which is being built, and the railway station building, which is about to have its scaffolding removed. Building after building stretches endlessly. In addition, there are rows of factory chimneys spewing black smoke. More than 300 buildings were completed around August 15th last year alone, and the scale of construction in Pyongyang this year is even larger than last year.
    The rebuilt Pyongyang is more magnificent and beautiful than before. This capital of the republic is a symbol of the achievements of the Korean people in restoring and building after the war. It shows that the Korean people, who defeated the aggressors, have victoriously built their beloved motherland from the ruins.

### 战后三年的朝鲜

    战后三年的朝鲜
    新华社记者　王玉章
    到今年七月二十七日，朝鲜的炮声已经停止三年了。现在，在这片受尽战争灾难的土地上，朝鲜人民的和平劳动已经结成了丰硕的果实。三年计划（1954—56年）即将被提前完成，预计今年的工业总产值将比1949年超过80％，在战火中遭到严重破坏的工厂、城市、农村都以很快的速度重新建设起来了。在反抗侵略战争中建立了英雄业绩的朝鲜人民，在生产建设中又创造了奇迹。
      恢复得又快又好
    不久以前，我曾经访问了正在恢复中的朝鲜著名的兴南肥料工厂。在战争中，这个工厂每六平方公尺内就落下了一颗炸弹，高大的厂房变成满布弹痕的断壁颓垣。厂地变成了废墟，上面长满了一人多深的蒿草。刚一停战，工人们就紧张地投入了恢复工作。经过工人们的艰苦奋斗，到去年五月，他们生产的白雪般的硫铵肥料在战后又同农民见面了，这种肥料施用一斤就能增产三斤半稻谷。
    这个厂现在拥有的生产设备已经恢复到年产十万吨硫铵肥料的规模。恢复起来的生产设备由于以新的技术进行了改造，性能比过去还好。这个工厂到1958年就要达到和超过战前水平，要生产四十多万吨。
    在战后三年间，像兴南肥料工厂一样，朝鲜北部已经有二百三十六个大、中型的工厂企业全部或部分恢复起来了，而且建设得比过去更好。此外还新建了七十一个大、中型工厂。金策制铁所的第一号高炉在去年恢复后每天生产着比解放前多一倍的生铁。黄海制铁所的五十吨的平炉扩建成为一百吨的平炉。恢复起来的平壤纺织工厂，设备和产量都比战前增加了一倍以上。
  朝鲜历史上未曾有过的
    在平壤举行的一个工业展览会上，人们拥挤着观看一架正在表演旋制机器零件的崭新光亮的旋床。这是朝鲜战后在兄弟国家的援助下新建成的熙川机械工厂的新产品，也是朝鲜历史上第一次生产的旋床。这个工厂每年能够生产一千八百多台车床。在解放前，朝鲜的机械工业只占工业总产值的1.6％，那时连一个纺织机的零件也要到日本去买。可是，在战后短短的几年内已经造出了旋床、钻床和刨床。难怪那么多的朝鲜人对这台旋床感到兴趣。
    在1955年，朝鲜的机械工业已经占工业总产值的17.9％。现在，各工厂的工人们正在用国产的车床进行劳动竞赛，矿工们用国产的凿岩机、皮带运输机、球磨机开采朝鲜地下丰富的矿藏。铁路工人用国产的钢轨铺路，渔业工人用朝鲜制造的机器船捕鱼，农民们用国产的一分钟可抽六十吨水的抽水机抽水灌田。这都是历史上未曾有过的。
    在解放前，朝鲜北部连一座纺织厂也没有。现在，平壤纺织工厂等纺织厂已经在战后建设起来了。
    战后新建的新义州搪瓷工厂出产的多采的搪瓷器皿，已经逐渐代替了朝鲜人惯用的铜碗、铜盆。即将在新浦渔港建成的罐头工厂，将把朝鲜东海岸特产的鲭鱼和大海蟹制成罐头运销国内外。朝鲜历史上未曾有过的事情正在越来越多地出现。
      改造自然的胜利
    平安南道灌溉工程完工的时候，我们去参观了这个著名的把碱地变成沃土的改造自然的工程。
    登上延丰水库旁边的高山，人们就看到这个把大同江和清川江的水连起来让它灌田的奇景。一座三十四公尺高、二百四十公尺长的混凝土坝在延丰地区拦成了一个十六公里长的山谷水库。经过水库流来的大同江水和清川江水在一条宽二十五公尺的人工的河流——灌溉工程的干渠中汇合。两条江的水卷着白色的浪花，沿着总长八百四十多公里的干渠和支渠浩浩荡荡地流向广阔的田野。
    日本人在1918年就开始兴建这个工程，他们修了二十多年，一直到他们离开朝鲜才建成了总工程量的18％，后来连这些也被战争破坏了。朝鲜人民在战后两年内就把它建成了。在战后的艰难的日子里，共和国政府动员了巨大的力量来建设这个工程。两条江的水在今年插秧的时候灌入了三万多町步（一町步约合十五市亩）稻田，并且将使这个地区增产约六万吨稻谷。
    两条江的水一直流入了“十二三千里平原”。这片著名的广及四个郡的平原，一眼望过去是一片白色的碱地，没有山，没有河，连棵树也不长。现在两条江的水给这片平原带来了生命。去年由于金城抽水站的完工已经使这里的稻谷增产了一倍，今年他们还要比去年再增产50％。平原上到处在盖新房子，文德郡龙林里一个里去冬今春就盖了八十四栋新房。由于新的移民的来到，这个里的人口也增加了一倍。水给这个平原带来了翻天复地的变化，这里的人民把平安南道灌溉工程的水叫做“生命水”。
  从废墟上重建起来的平壤
    我第一次到平壤是在战争时期的一个晚上，吉普车驶上了市区的布满了炸弹坑和机枪子弹痕的柏油路，在凄冷的月光下，满城到处是废墟、瓦砾堆。
    战后三年来，平壤有了很大变化。现在我站在平壤街头，可以看到新筑成的宽阔平坦的马路向四处伸展，马路两旁新盖了许多高楼大厦：从斯大林路由北往南数过去，隐在绿树丛中的牡丹峰剧场、楼顶上有一座朝鲜式亭子的五层的工人宿舍大楼、两座内阁联合办公厅的大楼、国际旅馆，以及正在打基础的科学院，正在安装门窗的金策工业大学，快要撤去脚手架的车站大楼。一幢连一幢的楼房简直望不到头，此外还点缀着一排排喷吐着黑烟的工厂烟囱。仅在去年“八一五”前后就有三百多幢楼房落成，今年平壤的建筑规模比去年还大。
    重建起来的平壤比过去更宏伟，更美丽。这个共和国的首都是朝鲜人民战后恢复建设成就的象征。它表明，战胜了侵略者的朝鲜人民，把可爱的祖国胜利地从废墟中建设起来了。
