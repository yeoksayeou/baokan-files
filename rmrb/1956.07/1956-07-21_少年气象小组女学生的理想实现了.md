		Junior Meteorology Group
		The Ideals of Female Students Have Been Realized
		Xinhua News Agency, Fuxin, July 19th: Four junior high school graduates from Fuxin City Middle School, who are fond of meteorological science, have been recommended to study at the Beijing Meteorological School.
		Cai Fengxian, Deng Yakun, Liu Xiangyan, and Hui Xiuyun, four girls, have a strong interest in meteorological science. For the past two years, they have initially mastered the methods of measuring weather phenomena by participating in extracurricular activities in the school's junior meteorology group. Cai Fengxian and Deng Yakun led reporters to visit their small weather station, carefully explaining how to use various instruments to measure air pressure, wind speed, rainfall, and temperature, as well as how to judge wind and rain. Deng Yakun told reporters: "The first time we told our classmates that it was going to rain, we were really scared. What if it didn't rain! When we saw that it really did rain, we were especially happy." They often talked about how great it would be to go to the Beijing Meteorological School to study! More than half a year before graduating this summer, they started writing letters to the Beijing Meteorological School, expressing their willingness to become meteorological science workers, master the changes in nature, and serve the motherland. When their request was recently approved, the entire class warmly congratulated them on the realization of their ideals. Deng Yakun is a top student. In her three years of junior high school, except for one course where she received a score of four, all other courses have consistently maintained a score of five. The other three girls also had mostly scores of five in all subjects. The only girl among the four who had not yet joined the Communist Youth League recently also submitted a request to join the League.

    少年气象小组
    女学生的理想实现了
    新华社阜新19日电　阜新市中学四个爱好气象科学的初中毕业生被保送到北京气象学校学习。
    才凤仙、邓亚坤、刘香艳、惠秀云四个女孩子对气象科学有着浓厚的兴趣。两年来，她们在参加校里少年气象小组的课外活动中，已经初步掌握了测量气象的方法。才凤仙和邓亚坤带领着记者参观了她们的小气象站，仔细讲解了利用各种仪器测量气压、风速、雨量、温度，以及判断风雨等方法。邓亚坤告诉记者说：“在我们头一次把判断出来要下雨的消息告诉同学时，心里真有点害怕，要是不下雨怎办哪！当我们看到天真的下起雨来，心里特别感到高兴。”她们经常在一起谈论着：能够到北京气象学校去学习该多好啊！离今年暑期毕业还差半年多的时候，她们就开始给北京气象学校写信，表示愿意做个气象科学工作者，掌握大自然的变化，为祖国服务。当她们的要求在最近被批准后，全班的学生热烈地祝贺她们的理想实现了。邓亚坤是个优等生，她在三年初中学习中，除有一门课程曾得过四分外，其他课程都一直保持了五分。另外三个女孩子的各科成绩也大部分是五分。四个女孩子里唯一的一个还没有入团的女孩子最近也提出了入团的要求。
