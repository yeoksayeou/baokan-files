Harbin Holds Advanced Experience Exchange Meeting on Capital Construction

(Our report) Harbin held an Advanced Experience Observation and Performance Conference on capital construction from the 12th to the 13th. At the conference, 43 kinds of advanced experiences with significant economic importance in civil construction, equipment installation, and saving construction materials were exchanged.

More than two thousand workers and technicians from capital construction departments in various cities and counties of Heilongjiang Province attended the conference and observed the performances of Li Shenghua and Song Hongcai, representatives of the construction system in Harbin who attended the National Conference of Advanced Producers. During his performance, Li Shenghua used ten advanced plastering tools he had created over the years and the slurry glazing method he learned from Beijing to quickly apply bright white slurry to the corners and eaves of brick walls. At this conference, Harbin's newly emerging experiences in equipment installation, metal structures, and saving construction materials received great attention from representatives of capital construction units in Harbin, Shenyang, and other places. Among them were the "Non-Ferrous Metal Busbar Electric Welding Method," which can increase efficiency fifteen times compared to flame welding, and the "Underground Cable Safety Detector," which can detect whether there are cables underground to avoid damaging cables during excavation.

After exchanging advanced experiences, the conference organized various construction and installation engineering companies in Harbin to sign contact contracts for mutual teaching and learning of advanced experiences. Special personnel were also organized at construction sites where these advanced experiences were created to establish advanced experience transmission schools, so that employees of construction and installation engineering companies in the city and other places could come to conduct in-depth study.

    哈尔滨开基本建设先进经验交流会
    本报讯　哈尔滨市在十二日到十三日举行了基本建设先进经验观摩表演大会，交流了土木建筑、设备安装和节约建筑材料等方面的四十三种有重大经济意义的先进经验。
    黑龙江省各市县基本建设部门的两千多名工人、技术人员，到会参观了哈尔滨市出席全国先进生产者代表会议的建筑系统代表李升华、宋洪才等的表演。李升华在表演时运用他几年来创造的十种先进抹灰工具和从北京学来的灰浆压光法，很快地在砖墙的墙角和墙檐下，抹上了洁白光亮的灰浆。在这次大会上，哈尔滨市新出现的设备安装、金属结构和节约建筑材料方面的经验，受到了哈尔滨、沈阳等地基本建设单位代表的很大重视。其中有能比火焊方法提高效率十五倍的“有色金属母线电焊法”，有能探知地下有无电缆线，避免掘伤电缆引起事故的“地下电缆安全探知器”等。
    大会在交流了先进经验以后，组织哈尔滨市各建筑安装工程公司签订了互教互学先进经验的联系合同。在创造这些先进经验的工地上，还组织专人建立先进经验传授学校，以便全市和外地的建筑安装工程公司职工，前来进行深入的学习。
