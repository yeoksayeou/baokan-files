    Why Two Different Treatments?
    The Property Management Office of the Zhenlai County People's Committee in Jilin Province has set two different rental rates for public dormitories. For the same type of housing, administrative staff pay just over one yuan, while staff from enterprises have to pay over three yuan. I don't understand, they are both national cadres, both receiving national wages, so why do they receive different treatment when renting houses? (Song Jun)

    为什么两种待遇？
    吉林省镇赉县人民委员会房产管理处，对公用宿舍订了两种租价。同样的房子，行政机关工作人员租是一元多，企业部门工作人员租就得三元多。我不明白，他们同样是国家的干部，同样领取着国家的工资，为什么租房子却受到不同的待遇呢？　（宋钧）
