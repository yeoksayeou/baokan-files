Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu Electric Dispatch: Recently, continuous torrential rains in various parts of Sichuan Province have caused flooding in some cities and rural areas. The Chinese People's Liberation Army troops stationed in the affected areas have been fully mobilized to assist state-owned enterprises, warehouses, agricultural cooperatives, and residents in heroic rescue efforts.

　　In Nanchong City, the flood this time was the largest in fifty-four years. The officers and soldiers of a certain unit stationed here braved the heavy rain in waist-deep water to carry out rescue operations. They rescued goods from the Nanchong City Department Store's retail department and warehouse, and transported more than 5,000 packages (approximately 1 million catties) of salt to safety. They also rescued goods worth more than 13,000 yuan for the supply and marketing cooperative. The officers of a certain unit stationed in the suburbs of the city fully assisted the agricultural cooperative in rushing to transport more than 15,000 catties of grain, and also harvested more than 10,000 catties of fresh corn in the deep water, and used more than 200 catties of surplus rice to help the disaster-stricken people who were experiencing difficulties in life.

　　Officers and soldiers of a certain unit stationed in Chongqing quickly transferred timber that was about to be swallowed by the river water to a safe place on a night when the floodwaters rose sharply, completing the transfer of 400,000 catties of timber. When the flood poured into Yongchuan County, thirteen officers and soldiers of a certain unit immediately formed a rescue team. In the morning, they assisted the grain depot in moving wheat, and in the afternoon, they went to the oil and fat company to move out more than 15,000 catties of rapeseed and some oil cakes. The troops stationed in Bishan County rescued 167 elderly people, women, and children from the floodwaters, and assisted four units including the local grain bureau in rescuing more than 400,000 catties of various materials.

    四川某些地区遭到洪水侵袭
    驻地解放军全部出动奋勇抢救
    据新华社成都电　不久前，四川省各地连降暴雨，有的城市和农村遭到洪水的侵袭。驻在受灾地区的中国人民解放军全部出动，协助国家企业、仓库、农业社和居民英勇地进行了抢救。
    在南充市，这次入侵的洪水是五十四年来最大的一次。驻在这里的某部官兵在齐腰深的大水里冒雨抢救，他们救出了市百货公司门市部和仓库中的物品，把五千多包（约一百万斤）的食盐运到了安全的地方，还为供销合作社抢救出价值一万三千多元的货物。驻在市郊区的某部军官们全力协助农业社抢运出一万五千多斤粮食，又在深水中抢收了一万多斤鲜玉米，并拿出节余的二百多斤大米救济生活困难的灾民。
    驻重庆某部官兵们在洪水猛涨的夜晚，把眼看就要被江水吞噬的木材迅速转移到安全地方，完成了四十万斤木材的转移工作。当洪水涌进永川县城的时候，某部十三个官兵立刻组成了一个抢救小组，他们在上午协助粮库搬运了小麦，下午又到油脂公司搬出了一万五千多斤菜籽和一部分油饼。驻在璧山县的部队在大水中救出了老人、妇女、小孩167人，并且协助当地的粮食局等四个单位抢救出各种物资四十多万斤。
