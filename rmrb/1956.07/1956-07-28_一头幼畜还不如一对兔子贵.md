    A Young Animal is Not as Valuable as a Pair of Rabbits
    Since this spring, the price of young animals has plummeted. The Zhoujiazhuang Agricultural Cooperative in Jinxian, Hebei, bred a total of eight young donkeys and seven calves last winter and this spring. Because the cooperative plants a lot of cotton and lacks fodder, it plans to keep the seven calves and sell the eight young donkeys. Cooperative member Li Wujin took the young donkey to the market two or three times, but the traders simply ignored him. The eighth team sold a young donkey this spring for only three yuan. The cooperative members say: Raising livestock is not as good as raising rabbits! A pair of three-month-old wool rabbits can sell for more than ten yuan.
    I suggest that relevant authorities pay attention to young animals, appropriately increase the price of young animals, or plan to transfer livestock bred in cash crop areas to food crop areas for feeding. Agricultural cooperatives should also pay attention to the breeding and raising of young animals.

    一头幼畜还不如一对兔子贵
    今春以来，幼畜价格暴跌，河北晋县周家庄农业社去冬今春共繁殖了幼驴八头、小牛七头，因为这个社种棉花多，饲草缺乏，计划把七头小牛养下来，把八头小毛驴卖出去。社员李五金牵着小驴到集上去了二、三趟，成交员们根本不理。第八队今春卖了一头小毛驴才卖了三元。社员们说：养牲口还不如养兔子哩！一对三月生的毛用兔还能卖十多元。
    我建议有关机关重视幼畜，适当提高幼畜价格，或有计划地把经济作物区繁殖的牲畜调剂到粮食作物区去喂养。农业社也应重视幼畜的繁殖饲养工作。
