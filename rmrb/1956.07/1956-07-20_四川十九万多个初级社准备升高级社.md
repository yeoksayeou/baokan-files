Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, July 17th: The existing 190,000+ elementary agricultural production cooperatives in Sichuan Province are currently undertaking preparations to upgrade to advanced cooperatives. Starting from early July, the counties have trained over 140,000 cadres and accountants for establishing advanced cooperatives. After a week to ten days of training, these individuals have returned to their respective townships to begin organizing preparatory committees for establishing cooperatives, and other related tasks.

The establishment of joint elementary cooperatives is also underway across various regions. According to incomplete statistics, over 60,000 joint elementary cooperatives have already been established throughout the province. These joint cooperatives generally consist of three to five neighboring elementary cooperatives voluntarily joining together, averaging around 200 households per cooperative. After the formation of the joint cooperatives, the production of each elementary cooperative is uniformly arranged and led by the joint cooperative committee. This creates a preliminary framework for upgrading to advanced cooperatives. Through the activities of the joint cooperatives, the leadership abilities of the cadres are also enhanced. Simultaneously, activities to promote the superiority of advanced cooperatives and the policies and methods for establishing advanced cooperatives are being widely carried out across various regions.

Sichuan Province originally had over 1,800 advanced cooperatives, with the number of farming households joining the cooperatives accounting for 3.8% of the province's total farming households. This year, the yield of spring crops such as wheat and rapeseed in these cooperatives was generally higher than in the surrounding elementary cooperatives, attracting farmers who desire to upgrade to advanced cooperatives. In order to meet the demands of the farmers, the Sichuan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has formulated a preliminary development plan, requiring each township in the province to establish one advanced cooperative (approximately 9,000+ in total) before the end of September. Before the end of the year, the goal is to have 80% of the province's farmers join advanced cooperatives.

    四川十九万多个初级社准备升高级社
    新华社成都17日电　四川省现有的十九万多个初级农业生产合作社，正在进行升高级社的准备工作。从七月初开始，各县训练的办高级社的干部和会计员共达十四万多人，这些人经过一周到十天的训练，已先后回到本乡着手组织建社筹备委员会等工作。
    建立初级社联社工作，也正在各地进行。据不完全统计，全省已经建立的初级社联社共有六万多个。这些联社一般由三到五个邻近的初级社自愿组成，平均每社约二百户左右。联社组成后，各初级社的生产由联社委员会统一安排领导。这样，就初步搭好了升高级社的架子。通过联社的活动，也提高了干部的领导能力。与此同时，宣传高级社的优越性和办高级社的政策、办法的活动，也在各地普遍展开。
    四川省原有高级社一千八百多个，入社农户占全省总农户数的3.8％。这些社今年的小麦、油菜等小春作物，普遍比周围的初级社增产，吸引了农民要求升高级社。为了适应农民的要求，中共四川省委员会已经制定出初步发展规划，要求全省在今年九月底前，每乡建立一个高级社（约九千多个），到年底前，争取全省80％的农户加入高级社。
