    Shoe Doctors
    In Shanghai's shoe stores, there are some shops and stalls called "Shoe Doctors" or "Shoe Hospitals." They specialize in treating all kinds of "difficult and complicated diseases" of leather shoes, trying every means to extend the life of the shoes for people.
    If the leather surface of your shoe is cracked, they have a machine that can sew it up in a few minutes. No matter what kind of hole it is, they can mend it properly. Worn soles are the most common problem. Customers can take off their shoes there, sit down and read the newspaper, and after an hour or two, walk out wearing shoes with new soles. Sometimes, if the shoes are too big, they can make them smaller; if they are too tight, they can use a special shoe stretcher to enlarge them, or take them apart and remake them to fit you perfectly.
    When men's old leather shoes are so worn that they can no longer be worn, they will carefully convert them into a pair of beautiful children's shoes or women's sandals. A leather briefcase can be converted into two pairs of leather shoes. Women's plastic handbags, if no longer suitable, can also be converted into a pair of openwork, new-style sandals.
    These shops and stalls are distributed in streets, alleys, and at the entrances of lanes; some people even carry burdens to provide door-to-door service. Their fees are not expensive. Minor problems can generally be repaired on the spot. For more complex handwork such as replacing soles or remaking shoes, they also meet the agreed deadlines.
    Invisible Weaving
    Shanghai has many weaving shops, which are factories for eliminating holes in clothes. If a new or relatively expensive garment is accidentally torn or burned by cigarette ashes, it is unsightly to patch it. But if you take it to a weaving shop, they can weave it for you. Whether it is wool, silk, woolen cloth, or thin gauze, no matter where it is torn or how big the hole is, they will weave it "seamlessly." Technicians extract thin fibers from the folds or facings of the garment and weave them according to the warp and weft of the material. After their hands have worked on it, the torn area will not show any trace at all.
    Some shops specialize in weaving expensive Taiwan mats, and some specialize in weaving nylon stockings, and they all have unique skills. For long nylon stockings with holes that are too large to weave, they will also convert them into ankle socks.
    New Uses for Old Yarn
    People's worn-out woolen sweaters and leftover old yarn scraps have now found new uses. In the past two years, a new industry has emerged in Shanghai that can reprocess these waste yarns for reuse. In these shops, there is a simple wooden machine that can card the waste yarn into shredded fluff and then spin it into new yarn. Sweaters knitted from this yarn are almost as good as new ones. If the color has faded too much, it can be redyed to restore its original color. If customers bring in scraps of yarn of various colors, they can also piece them together, card them into shredded fluff, and turn them into a beautiful colored yarn.
    Waste yarn that is too badly damaged can be carded into shredded fluff and used as wadding for cotton-padded clothes instead of cotton. Wearing such clothes in winter is light and warm, almost as good as camel hair.
    Using waste yarn to knit new woolen sweaters is not expensive, and the loss is not much, so it is very popular. Now, many places in Shanghai have opened such shops, and in their shop windows, people can often see yarn that looks like new.
    Hair Comes Alive
    Getting a haircut in a barbershop in Shanghai can be said to be a pleasure. There are many highly skilled barbers here who are meticulous in rolling your hair, cutting your hair, washing your hair, and shaving your face. When you lie in a leather chair to have your face shaved, they are always so gentle that you feel comfortable.
    Some barbers are particularly good at cutting children's hair. They are familiar with children's psychology and will make all kinds of noises while cutting their hair to divert the children's attention, eliminate their fear of haircuts, and then use quick and skillful techniques to quickly finish the haircut for the child. A barber named Li Songshou has almost no crying children getting haircuts from him, and many parents come to him specifically to have their children's hair cut.
    Barbers can also create all kinds of hairstyles. Based on their years of experience, they create various hairstyles according to the different face shapes of customers. Recently, Shanghai barbers have designed dozens of new hairstyles. Customers praised a barber named Liu Ruiqing, saying: Hair comes alive in his hands.
    There are more than 2,800 barbershops in Shanghai. There are also many barber stalls. These barbers bring basins and tools to customers' homes or workplaces to serve customers who are not able to go to the barbershop.
    In the Bathhouse
    Many people in Shanghai like to go to the bathhouse to take a bath, because they can not only wash comfortably there, but also rest well.
    In the bathhouse, there are many facilities for serving customers, which can also solve many problems for customers. People can get their hair cut, shoes shined, weigh themselves, order food, and lie on the bath couch to have their faces shaved, make phone calls, and read various books and newspapers prepared specifically for bathers. In Shanghai's largest bathhouse, Yudechi, there is a quick-wash department where customers can take off their dirty clothes and hand them over. By the time they finish bathing, the clothes have been washed, ironed, and ready to wear immediately.
    After the joint state-private ownership of bathhouses, employees pay more attention to cleanliness and hygiene. They separate bath towels and face towels, disinfect teaware, and wash and change bathrobes and large towels every day. The water in the bath is always clear. After people finish bathing, the employees always use alkaline water, soap, detergent powder, and grindstones to scrub. In addition to pools and tubs, many bathhouses have added showers, and some have opened women's bathhouses. Often, families of several people come here to bathe at the same time, and customers find it very convenient.
    Small Stalls Scattered Like Stars
    In the streets and alleys of Shanghai, there are all kinds of small stalls, some selling snacks, some selling groceries, and others ironing clothes, boiling water, selling cigarettes, making clothes, repairing stoves... They all have a close relationship with people's daily lives. Whether it is early morning or late at night, customers can eat various flavors of breakfast and late-night snacks at the snack stalls near their homes, and buy all kinds of small items needed in daily life.
    The tailor's stall at the entrance of the lane can do many odd jobs of needlework for housewives; the ironing stall can iron customers' clothes flat at any time. The water boiler can carry hot water upstairs and into the room, pouring the water into the customer's bathtub.
    Whether it is windy or rainy, people can find these small stalls, which use relatively cheap prices and flexible service methods to solve many daily life problems for customers, becoming an indispensable part of people's lives.
    Similar popular and excellent service styles like these are numerous in Shanghai's commercial sector, such as purchasing goods by telephone, ordering goods based on samples, and meticulous commodity packaging, which are not only maintained but also being continued to be promoted.
    People love these good service methods and will not forget these people who silently serve the masses.

    受到顾客欢迎的服务方式
    穆青  叶世涛
    鞋医生
    在上海的皮鞋店中，有一些名叫“鞋医生”、“皮鞋病院”的店铺和摊头。它们专治皮鞋的各种“疑难杂病”，为人们想尽一切办法来延长皮鞋的寿命。
    如果你的皮鞋面子裂缝了，他们有一种机器，几分钟就能给缝好，不管什么样的破洞，也可以补得妥贴。鞋底磨穿是最常见的毛病，顾客可以在它们那里脱掉鞋子，坐下来看报，一两个钟头后就能穿了配上新底的皮鞋走出去。有时，皮鞋大了，他们会给你改小；太紧了，又能用一种特殊的楦头把它放大，或者拆线重做，使你大小合脚。
    男子的旧皮鞋，破损到不能再穿的时候，他们会给你精打细算地改成一双漂亮的童鞋或妇女的凉鞋，一只公文皮包可以改成两双皮鞋。妇女们的玻璃皮包，不适用了，也能改一双漏空的、新型的凉鞋。
    这些店铺和摊头，分布在街头巷尾和弄堂口；有些人还挑着担子上门来服务。他们取费都不贵。一般小毛病都能当场修好，换底、改制等需要比较复杂的手工，他们也约期不误。
    织补得天衣无缝
    上海有许多织补店，是消灭衣服破洞的工厂。一件新的或是价格比较贵的衣服，不慎擦破，或是给烟烬烧破了，补上一块是很难看的。但拿到织补店去就可以给你织好，无论是呢绒绸缎、毛葛薄纱，不论破在那里，洞有多大，他们都会织补得“天衣无缝”。技工们从衣服的折缝里或贴边处抽出一根根细细的纤维，按着料子的经线纬线织上去。经过他们的双手，破的地方就看不出丝毫的痕迹来。
    有的店专门织补名贵的台湾席的，也有专门织补玻璃丝袜的，他们都有独到的手艺。有些破洞过大，织补不上算的长统玻璃丝袜，他们还会把它改为短袜。
    旧绒线的新用途
    人们穿破了的绒线衣和拆下来的零星旧绒线，现在找到新用途了。最近两年，上海出现了一个新的行业，它们能够把这些废绒线经过加工重新使用。在这些店里，有一只简单的木机，可以把废绒线弹成碎绒，然后结成新的绒线，这种绒线编成的绒线衣，和新的差不了多少。褪色太厉害的，可以重新染过，恢复它原来的色泽。如果顾客拿来的是各种颜色的零星绒线，他们也可以把它拼凑起来弹成碎绒，变成一种很美丽的彩色绒线。
    有些破损太厉害的废绒线，弹成碎绒后，也可以代替棉花来絮棉衣，冬天穿上这样的衣服，又轻又暖，和驼绒差不了多少。
    用废绒线编新绒线衣，价格并不贵，损耗也不多，因此很受人们的欢迎。现在，上海很多地方都开设了这样的店铺，在它们的橱窗里，人们可以经常看到像新的一样的绒线。
    头发变活了
    在上海的理发店里理发，可以说是一种享受。这里有许多技术高明的理发师，他们替你轧发、剪发、洗头和修面，都很细致。当你躺在皮椅上修面的时候，他们总是那样轻手轻脚，使你感到舒适。
    有些理发师特别擅长于给孩子理发。他们熟悉孩子的心理，在理发的时候，会做出各种各样的声音，转移孩子的注意力，消除他们对理发的恐惧，然后用迅速轻巧的手法，很快地给孩子理完发。有一个叫李松寿的理发师，在他那里理发的孩子，几乎没有哭哭啼啼的，许多家长都特地来找他替孩子理发。
    理发师们还会做各种各样的发式，他们根据多年来的经验，按照顾客不同的脸型，做出各种不同的发型。最近，上海的理发师已经设计出几十种新的发式。顾客们称赞一个叫刘瑞卿的理发师说：头发到了他手上，就变得活起来了。
    上海有二千八百多家理发店。还有很多理发摊头。这些理发工人带着面盆、工具到顾客家里或工作的地方去，专门替一些不便于到理发店去的顾客服务。
    在浴室里
    上海有许多人喜欢到浴室去洗澡，因为在那里不但能洗得痛快，而且还可以很好地休息。
    在浴室里，有许多为顾客服务的设备，可以顺便给顾客解决很多的问题。人们可以在这里理发、擦皮鞋、磅体重、叫菜叫饭，还可以躺在浴榻上修面、打电话和阅读专为浴客准备的各种书报。在上海最大的浴室——浴德池里，有一个快洗部，顾客把身上的脏衣服脱下来交给他们，等洗完澡，衣服已经洗干净，烫平贴，马上可以穿了。
    浴室公私合营后，职工们更加注意清洁卫生工作。他们把浴巾和面巾分开，茶具经过消毒，浴衣和大毛巾每天都洗换一次。浴池的水经常是清澈的，人们洗完澡后，职工们总是用碱水、肥皂、去污粉和麻石子来擦洗。许多浴室除了池塘、盆塘以外，还增加了淋浴，有的还开辟了女子浴室，经常有一家数口同时来这里洗澡，顾客感到非常方便。
    星罗棋布的小摊头
    在上海的街头巷尾，有着各种各样的小摊头，有的卖点心，有的卖杂货，还有烫衣服的、烧开水的、卖香烟的、做衣服的、修炊具的……他们都和人民的日常生活有着密切的关系。无论是清晨和深夜，顾客可以在住所附近的点心摊上吃到各种口味的早点和宵夜，买到日常生活中所需要的各种小东西。
    弄堂口的裁缝摊可以代替家庭主妇们做许多零星的针线；烫衣摊可以随时给顾客把衣服烫平。烧开水的可以挑着热水登楼入室，把水倒进顾客的浴盆里。
    不论刮风或是下雨，人们都可以找到这些小摊头，他们用比较便宜的价格，灵活的服务方式，为顾客解决许多日常生活中的问题，成为人们生活中不可缺少的一部分。
    类似这样受人欢迎的优良的服务作风，在上海的商业部门中有许多，譬如用电话购货，看样子定货，精细的商品包装等等，不仅保持着而且正在继续发扬。
    人们喜爱这种好的服务方法，也忘不了这些默默地为群众服务的人。
