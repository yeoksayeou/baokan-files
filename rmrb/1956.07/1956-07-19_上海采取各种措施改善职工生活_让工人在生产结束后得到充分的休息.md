Xinhua News Agency report: This year, in the first half of the year, a survey of the living conditions of workers was widely conducted in factories and enterprises and workers' residential areas in Shanghai. From the secretaries of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China to the leaders of various industrial departments and factories and enterprises, workers' families were widely visited, and various meetings were held to discuss improving workers' lives. New measures to improve workers' lives are being implemented in many ways.

So far, the vast majority of industrial supervisory bureaus and major factories under central jurisdiction have submitted applications to the building planning departments to entrust the construction of workers' housing. According to statistics, more than 36,000 households of workers' housing need to be built in Shanghai in the next two years; of these, 7,000 to 9,000 households have been included in this year's construction plan, and nearly 3,000 households have already started construction.

According to the survey, about 9% of workers' residences are more than 15 li away from the factory. At present, state-owned cigarette, cotton spinning and other factories are continuing to organize workers who live far from the factory to voluntarily transfer to other factories or exchange housing; some factories have added collective dormitories in or near the factory for workers who live far from the factory.

Old workers' residences have been widely repaired. Private dilapidated houses owned by workers are also being helped with repairs.

Many factories have provided temporary or regular subsidies to workers with low wages and difficult living conditions. Some factories have also absorbed the family members of workers with difficult lives to work in the factory.

The time for workers' spare-time meetings has been reduced to no more than one and a half hours per week in many factories.

The relevant departments and factories and enterprises have paid doubled attention to summer hygiene work.

Many factories have taken various measures to allow workers to get adequate rest and sleep after production. Textile factories and some cigarette factories that operate day and night in three shifts have generally prepared on-site sleeping rooms for night shift workers who have crowded housing and large families. The state-owned Shanghai No. 2 and No. 9 Cotton Textile Factories recently vacated part of the club rooms and placed beds or cool mats for night shift workers to sleep; the No. 1 and No. 7 Cotton Textile Factories also cleaned up all available empty rooms for night shift workers to sleep. Some factories used the open space near the family dormitory to build cool temporary sleeping sheds, allowing workers to rest or sleep there on hot nights. In the areas where family dormitories of workers are concentrated in Huxi and Hudong, the system of inserting red flags for sleeping at the doors of workers' homes has recently been widely implemented. The family members of workers agreed not to let children play in places with red flags, so as not to disturb the night shift workers' sleep. The trade unions and family committees of some factories are also actively preparing summer children's recreation rooms and children's clubs in workers' residential areas for children to play during the summer, so as to avoid children making noise in the dormitories.

    上海采取各种措施改善职工生活
    让工人在生产结束后得到充分的休息
    据新华社讯　今年上半年，在上海的工厂企业和工人住宅区普遍进行了职工生活状况的调查，从中共上海市委员会的书记到各个工业部门和工厂企业的领导人员，广泛地访问了工人的家庭，召开了各种讨论改善职工生活的会议，并且正在从多方面实施改善职工生活的新措施。
    到目前为止，绝大部分工业主管局和中央管辖的主要工厂，都向建筑规划部门提出了委托建造职工住宅的申请。据统计，在今明两年之内上海需要建筑的职工住宅，有三万六千多户；其中有七千到九千户，已经列入今年的建筑计划，并且有近三千户已经动工兴建。
    根据调查，约有9％的职工住宅离工厂在十五里以上。目前，国营卷烟、棉纺等工厂中，正在继续组织离厂远的职工进行自愿调厂或对换住宅；有的厂在厂内或附近增加了集体宿舍，供离厂远的职工住宿。
    旧的工人住宅，已经广泛地开始进行修缮。职工私有的破漏房屋，也在帮助修理。
    许多工厂对工资收入较低、生活困难的职工，都进行了临时的或定期的补助。有些工厂还吸收了生活困难的职工的家属进厂工作。
    职工业余开会的时间，在许多厂里已经减少到每周不超过一小时半。
    夏季的卫生工作也已受到有关部门和工厂企业加倍的注意。
    许多工厂已经采取了多种多样的办法，让工人们能在生产结束以后得到充分的休息和睡眠。日夜三班进行生产的纺织工厂和一部分卷烟厂，已经普遍为住房挤、家庭人口多的夜班工人准备了厂内睡眠室。国营上海第二、第九棉纺织厂最近腾出了俱乐部的一部分房间，安置了床或凉席，让夜班工人去睡觉；第一和第七棉纺织厂也把一切可以利用的空房打扫出来，让给夜班工人睡眠。有的厂利用家属宿舍附近的空地搭上风凉的临时睡眠篷，让职工们在炎热的夜晚到那里去休息或睡眠。沪西、沪东许多工人家属宿舍集中的地区，最近还普遍实行了在工人家门口插睡眠红旗的制度。职工家属们互相约定，不让孩子在插有红旗的地方嘻戏游玩，以免妨碍夜班工人睡觉。还有一些工厂的工会和家属委员会，正在积极筹备工人住宅区的暑期儿童文娱活动室、儿童俱乐部，以备暑期儿童游玩，避免孩子们在宿舍里吵闹。
