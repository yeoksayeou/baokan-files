Wuxi Yunong Oil Factory

Uses Waste to Refine Tung Oil

This newspaper reports: The local state-owned Wuxi Yunong Oil Factory recently, based on a suggestion from Wuxi resident Xu Shoukang, and with Xu Shoukang's participation, successfully refined tung oil using waste materials such as tung oil skin and oil dregs from the cooking pots. According to calculations, after this experience is promoted throughout Jiangsu Province, annual tung oil production can be increased by 250,000 jin, and costs can be reduced by 10%-30%.
