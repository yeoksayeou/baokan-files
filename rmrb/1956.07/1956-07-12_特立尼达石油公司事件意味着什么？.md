What does the Trinidad Oil Company incident mean?
Lè Shān

    “A shameful act of surrender”

    The British government's decision to sell the Trinidad Oil Company to the American Texaco Oil Company for $176 million has stirred up a shock in British public opinion. The "Daily Express" denounced the decision as a "shameful act of surrender." Wilson, the Labor Party's spokesman on economic affairs, said in the House of Commons that it was "a regrettable deal that has stunned the country." However, the British House of Commons approved the British government's decision on the evening of June 20 by a vote of 315 to 247.

    An Important Oil Production Area of the British Empire

    Trinidad is the second largest island in the British West Indies after Jamaica. Together with Tobago, it has an area of 5,128 square kilometers and a population of 669,650. The capital is called Port of Spain.

    In the 16th century, Trinidad was a Spanish possession and became British in 1797. In 1941, the United States established naval and air bases here.

    Trinidad is an important oil production area within the British Empire. According to statistics from the London "Times," oil exports account for 75% of Trinidad's total exports.

    The Trinidad Oil Company is the largest company on the island and one of the largest British oil companies. The company produces one million tons of oil annually and controls about 40% of the British oil sales network. It has established a refinery on the island to refine the island's crude oil, as well as crude oil imported from Venezuela and Colombia in South America. It has also set up an offshore oil production station 15 miles off the coast, near Venezuela, for seabed exploitation. According to a report in "The Economist" magazine, the Trinidad Oil Company's net profit for the last year (i.e., the year ending June 30, 1955) was £2.3 million.

    Cruel Facts

    The Trinidad Oil Company incident is another very prominent example of the penetration of American capital into the British Empire.

    For many years, the American Texaco Oil Company has forced the Trinidad Oil Company to reach an "agreement" to get involved in refining Trinidad's oil. However, Texaco Oil Company was not satisfied with this.

    According to a statement by Firth, the general manager of the Trinidad Oil Company, published in "The Times," Texaco Oil Company decided to build a refinery on Trinidad. If the plan were realized, the Trinidad Oil Company would face a fatal threat. Because the Trinidad Oil Company could not have cheap crude oil from the Middle East for refining like the Texaco Oil Company, it could only use crude oil produced on the island or imported from Venezuela and Colombia at prices several times higher. In this way, the cost of the product would be much higher than that of Texaco Oil Company.

    As has happened in some other cases, British oil capitalists decided to give up territory and get some compensation that could still be obtained. They reminded the British that "if we accept the Americans' terms, it means that we will increase our gold and dollar reserves by $180 million."

    The deal was concluded in this way. But the matter is not just about the oil business on this island.

    Originally, the products of the Trinidad Oil Company were distributed throughout the United Kingdom by a company called Regent. The Trinidad Oil Company held 50% of the shares of Regent, and the remaining 50% was equally divided between American Texaco Oil Company and American Standard Oil Company of California. After Texaco Oil Company bought the Trinidad Oil Company, it could hold 75% of the shares of Regent and seize an important oil sales network in Britain into its own hands.

    In addition, the Trinidad Oil Company is also exploring oil in Canada. This is of course also important to the business of Texaco Oil Company.

    To what extent?

    This kind of penetration, erosion, and seizure of the interests of British oil monopoly capital by American oil monopoly capital, as the British "Daily Express" Sven pointed out, "is a steady and continuous process."

    According to the "Daily Express's" "complete exposure of the danger to Britain," this "process" is as follows:

    The United States first seized the oil fields of Iraq. Before World War I, the Americans had no oil interests in Iraq, but now the Americans occupy more than 23% of the oil fields in Iraq.

    Britain once exclusively controlled the Kuwait oil fields, but last year half of the 54 million tons of oil produced by this oil field was taken away by the United States.

    Then, the Americans came to Abadan. This was the British's forbidden zone, and the Americans had coveted it for a long time. The British were squeezed out.

    Now, it has penetrated into the British lanes. Texaco Oil Company swallowed the Trinidad Oil Company.

    Although this often happens between the Anglo-Saxon allies who are praised all the time, the "Daily Express" cannot help but ask indignantly: "The Americans are fond of oil. They know that this is the fuel of the times. To what extent - until when? Are we going to lose our oil? Must we lose our oil resources?"

    Not just a commercial matter

    The "Daily Express" could not help but reveal the more far-reaching significance of this matter: "This is not just a matter of oil supply. If the Trinidad oil fields fall into the hands of the United States, this colony will be transferred to the sphere of influence of the United States."

    The "Times" editorial said with regret and indignation: "We are on the eve of organizing a Caribbean Federation. The new Caribbean Federation may become an autonomous dominion in the Commonwealth in a few years. … The wealth of Trinidad is the financial foundation of the future federation. In this way, the transfer of equity in the Trinidad Oil Company is indeed not simply a commercial matter."

    The "Daily Express" still said it well: "Working for the American Yankees means being under the wing of the United States."

    特立尼达石油公司事件意味着什么？
    乐山
    “可耻的投降行为”
    英国政府决定把特立尼达石油公司出售给美国德士古石油公司，代价是一亿七千六百万美元。消息传出以后，激起了英国舆论的震动。“每日快报”指责这个决定是一种“可耻的投降行为”。英国工党在经济事务方面的发言人威尔逊在下院说，这是“使得全国惊愕的一种令人遗憾的买卖”。但是英国议会下院于六月二十日晚上以315票对247票，批准了英国政府的这个决定。
    英帝国的重要石油产地
    特立尼达岛是英属西印度群岛中仅次于牙买加的第二个大岛，与多巴哥岛合计面积5，128平方公里，人口669，650人，首府叫做西班牙港。
    十六世纪时，特立尼达岛是西班牙的属地，1797年归于英国。1941年美国在这里建立了海、空军基地。
    特立尼达岛是英帝国范围内重要的石油产地。根据伦敦“泰晤士报”的统计，特立尼达岛输出的石油占它的输出总额的75％。
    特立尼达石油公司是岛上最大的公司，也是英国最大的石油公司之一。这家公司年产石油一百万吨，并控制英国石油销售网的40％左右。它在岛上设立了一座炼油厂，提炼岛上的原油，也提炼自南美委内瑞拉与哥伦比亚输入的原油。它还在离海岸十五哩的接近委内瑞拉的海上，设有一座海上采油站，进行海底开采。根据“经济学家”周刊的报道，上年度（即截至1955年6月30日为止的一年）特立尼达石油公司所得的净利是二百三十万英镑。
    残酷的事实
    特立尼达石油公司事件，是美国资本渗入英帝国的又一个极为突出的实例。
    在过去许多年间，美国德士古石油公司已经迫使特立尼达石油公司达成了“协议”，在提炼特立尼达岛的石油上插了一手。但是，德士古石油公司并不以此为满足。
    根据“泰晤士报”所载特立尼达石油公司总经理弗斯的谈话，德士古石油公司决定在特立尼达岛建造一座炼油厂。如果计划实现，特立尼达石油公司就会面临致命的威胁。因为特立尼达石油公司不能像德士古石油公司那样有中东的便宜的原油供炼油之用，它只能用本岛出产的或是从委内瑞拉、哥伦比亚输入的价格高好几倍的原油。这样，产品的成本将高过德士古石油公司很多。
    像曾经发生过的另外一些情况一样，英国的石油资本家决定让出地盘而取得还能够捞得到的一点补偿。他们提醒英国人说：“如果我们接受了美国人的条件，那就意味着我们要增加一亿八千万美元的黄金与美元的储备”。
    买卖就这样成交了。可是事情还不仅是这个岛上的石油企业的问题。
    原来，特立尼达石油公司的产品，是由一个名叫里根特的公司在英国各地经销的。特立尼达石油公司握有里根特公司50％的股权，其余的50％由美国德士古石油公司与美国加利福尼亚美孚石油公司均分。德士古石油公司收买了特立尼达石油公司以后，它就可以持有里根特公司75％的股权，把英国一个重要的石油销售网也抓到自己的手里。
    此外，特立尼达石油公司还在加拿大开采石油。这对德士古石油公司的事业，当然也是重要的。
    到什么地步为止呢？
    美国石油垄断资本对英国石油垄断资本的利益的这种渗入、蚕食和夺取，如英国“每日快报”斯文地指出的那样：“是稳步的持续的过程。”
    根据“每日快报”的“对英国的危险的全部揭露”，这个“过程”是这样的：
    美国首先夺取的是伊拉克的油田。第一次世界大战以前，美国人在伊拉克并没有石油权益，但是现在美国人占有伊拉克23％以上的油田。
    英国曾经单独控制过科威特油田，可是去年这个油田出产的五千四百万吨石油被美国运走了一半。
    接着，美国人来到了阿巴丹。这是英国人的禁脔，美国人垂涎已久，英国人被挤出去了。
    现在，又深入到英国的小径了。德士古石油公司吞吃了特立尼达石油公司。
    这虽然是在时刻被颂扬的盎格鲁撒克逊盟国之间常发生的事，但是“每日快报”仍然不禁愤慨地问道：“美国人是欢喜石油的。他们知道这是时代的燃料。到什么地步为止——到什么时候为止？我们要失去我们的石油吗？我们必须要丧失我们的石油资源吗？”
    不单纯是一个商业事务
    “每日快报”还忍不住道出了这件事情的更为深远的意义：“这不仅仅是一个石油供应问题。如果特立尼达油田落入美国手中，这个殖民地就将转入美国的势力范围。”
    “泰晤士报”的社论抱着惋惜和忧愤的心情说：“我们正处在组织一个加勒比联邦的前夕。新的加勒比联邦无需多年就可以成为英联邦中的一个自治领。……特立尼达的财富是未来联邦的财政基础。这样看来，特立尼达石油公司股权的转移，的确不单纯是一个商业事务了。”
    还是“每日快报”说得好：“为美国佬的金元而工作意味着处在美国的卵翼下。”
