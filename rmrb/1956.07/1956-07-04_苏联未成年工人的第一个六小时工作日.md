    The Soviet Union's First Six-Hour Workday for Minor Workers
    Sunday, July 1st, was a day off. On Monday, July 2nd, minor workers in the Soviet Union aged sixteen to eighteen began to implement a six-hour workday. The Moscow Three Hills Textile United Factory made good preparations, organizing minor workers into special production groups, dividing them into two shifts, and allocating them fixed machines. Young female worker Guo Valyova said: "The workday has been shortened, and our wages remain the same. We will do our best to work even better than before." One hundred and twenty minor workers at the Leningrad Printing Machine Factory left work earlier than usual and happily went home. The minor employees of the Red October Steel Plant in Stalingrad have many places to go after getting off work early. The factory's swimming pool, sports field, club, and library are open to them.

    苏联未成年工人的第一个六小时工作日
    七月一日是星期天，七月二日苏联十六岁到十八岁的未成年工人开始实行六小时工作日。莫斯科三山纺织联合工厂作了很好准备。把未成年工人组成特别生产组，分两班工作，拨给他们固定的机器。青年女工郭瓦廖娃说：“工作日缩短了，我们的工资照旧。我们将全力比从前更好地工作。”列宁格勒印刷机器工厂的一百二十个未成年工人比往日早下班，兴高采烈地回家去。斯大林格勒红十月钢铁厂未成年职工提早下班后去处很多。工厂的游泳场、运动场、俱乐部、图书馆向他们开放着。
