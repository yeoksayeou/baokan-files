    Blasting Reefs

    (Our dispatch) This newspaper reports that the Huanghe River reef blasting project in the Laoniuwan to Guanhekou section of Pianguan County, Shanxi Province, has been completed ahead of schedule in June. This reef blasting project is a part of the entire Huanghe River reef blasting project. After the completion of the project, it can avoid the past tragedies of ships hitting reefs due to the standing reef clusters, and it can also stimulate the material exchanges between the northwestern counties of Shanxi Province and the Inner Mongolia region.

    All the staff and workers who were responsible for the reef blasting project, with the help of the experienced boatmen who were familiar with the Huanghe River, overcame numerous difficulties. They wrapped yellow explosive packages in cloth, and coated the outside with asphalt, replacing the gelatinous explosives required for underwater explosions, solving the problem of insufficient materials. In the early stage of construction, it took them more than ten days to blast a reef. Later, after repeated research and experimentation by all the staff and workers, they improved the blasting method, which greatly improved the reef blasting efficiency.

    炸礁
    本报讯　山西省偏关县老牛湾至关河口段的黄河炸礁工程已在六月份提前完成。这段炸礁工程是整个黄河炸礁工程的一部分。工程完成后，可以避免过去因礁石群立，经常发生的行船触礁的惨剧，并且可以活跃山西省西北部各县同内蒙古地区的物资交流。
    担负炸礁工程任务的全体职工，在当地具有丰富行船经验、熟悉黄河水性的老船工的帮助下，克服了重重困难。他们用布将黄色炸药包扎起来，外面涂上沥青，代替水底爆炸所需用的胶质炸药，解决了材料不足的问题。在施工初期，他们炸一块礁石需要十几天，后来经过全体职工多次研究、试验，改进了爆炸方法，大大提高了炸礁效率。　　　　（山西日报编辑部）
