Former Kuomintang Military and Political Personnel Hold Symposium
Willing to Contribute to the Peaceful Liberation of Taiwan

    (Our report) The Beijing Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, on the afternoon of the 10th, invited some CPPCC members and former Kuomintang military and political personnel to a symposium on the issue of liberating Taiwan.

    Chen Jiujing (female), former legislator of the Kuomintang Legislative Yuan, said: "Everyone is very excited after reading Premier Zhou's statement on the peaceful liberation of Taiwan. Normally, the compatriots in Taiwan are also happy. I want to do my best to write letters to my old friends in Taiwan, asking them to dispel their doubts, welcome them to come to Beijing as guests, and hope that they will make contributions to the peaceful liberation of Taiwan!" Yu Zhenhe, former Kuomintang army commander, former commander of the Jiang army's Datong Military Command, and deputy commander-in-chief of the Seventh Army Group, said: "Now is the best opportunity for the Kuomintang military and political personnel in Taiwan to perform meritorious service. For the sake of their own future, they should repent as soon as possible." He also said: "Since liberation, I have personally felt the government's leniency and witnessed many Kuomintang military and political personnel being properly settled. In the future, I will do everything in my power to work for the peaceful liberation of Taiwan."

    Chen Jiazhen, former commander of the Jiang army's Changchun Garrison, Huang Xiang, former commander of the Jiang army's 92nd Army, and Wang Lizhai, former major general instructor of the Kuomintang Army University, also spoke at the symposium.

    Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, 8th. Willing to contribute their own strength to the peaceful liberation of Taiwan, this is the unanimous attitude expressed by former Kuomintang military and political personnel in Fujian Province at a gathering.

    More than 110 former Kuomintang military and political personnel participated in a gathering hosted by the Fujian Provincial Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang in Fuzhou on the 7th to discuss the issue of peaceful liberation of Taiwan.

    Li Lizhou, former member of the Kuomintang Control Yuan and director of the Fujian Provincial Department of Education, and now a member of the Fujian Provincial Committee of the CPPCC, said: "Historically, Taiwan belonged to Fujian Province, and most of the Taiwan compatriots are also from Fujian, so we in Fujian Province are more concerned about the liberation of Taiwan. I believe that not only do Taiwan compatriots love the motherland, but the vast majority of Taiwan military and political personnel also love the motherland. We have a responsibility to help them eliminate their concerns and work together to contribute to the peaceful liberation of Taiwan."

    Li Shijia, former Vice Minister of the Kuomintang Navy Department and Commander of the Second Fleet, recalled his hesitant mood when the mainland was liberated in 1949, saying that the fact proves that the guarantees of life and property for Kuomintang military and political personnel declared by the liberated areas at that time were fully realized, and I also saw the motherland making rapid progress. Li Shijia is currently a member of the Fujian Provincial Committee of the CPPCC. After Japan surrendered, he served as the commander of the Kuomintang Tai-Peng Naval Base, participated in the Japanese surrender ceremony in Taipei, and personally accepted the Japanese fleet in Zuoying. He said that he would tell his old colleagues in Taiwan, especially naval personnel, about his experiences and what he has seen: As long as the interests of the country and the nation are given priority, loving the country is not a matter of who comes first.

    Weng Zuiting, former Secretary-General of Gansu Province of the Kuomintang, who is 79 years old, said: "The Chinese Communist Party has always given priority to the interests of the country and the nation. The Taiwan authorities only need to look back at the 'Double Twelfth' Incident in Xi'an that year to recognize the sincerity of the Communist Party." He hoped that the Taiwan authorities would respond to the call of "patriotism as one family", conduct consultations and complete the reunification of the motherland.

    Zheng Zhenwen, former director of the Chinese Academy of Arts and Sciences and director of the Natural Science Department of the National Compilation and Translation Bureau, and Lin Shunfan, former chief of staff of the Kuomintang Navy Second Fleet Command, also spoke at the meeting. They all hoped that their old friends and old colleagues in Taiwan would respond to the call of "patriotism as one family" and return to the embrace of the motherland and reunite again.

    前国民党军政人员举行座谈
    愿为和平解放台湾贡献力量
    本报讯　中国人民政治协商会议北京市委员会，十日下午邀集部分政协委员和前国民党军政人员座谈解放台湾问题。
    前国民党立法院立法委员陈久敬（女）说：“每一个人看了周总理关于和平解放台湾问题的发言都是非常兴奋的。依照常情，台湾的同胞同样也是高兴的。我要尽我的力量，给台湾的老朋友写信，要他们消除疑虑，欢迎他们到北京来作客，希望他们为和平解放台湾立功！”曾任国民党军长、前蒋军大同军事指挥官、第七集团军副总司令的于镇河说：“现在是在台湾的国民党军政人员最好的立功机会，为自己的前途着想，应该从速悔悟”。他又说：“解放以来，我亲身感受到政府的宽大，也亲眼见到许多国民党军政人员都得到了妥善的安置。今后我当尽一切力量为和平解放台湾而努力。”
    在座谈会上发言的还有前蒋军长春防守司令陈家珍、前蒋军九十二军军长黄翔、前国民党陆军大学少将教官王理斋等人。
    新华社福州8日电　愿为和平解放台湾贡献自己的力量，这是福建省的前国民党军政人员在一次集会上所一致表示的态度。
    前国民党军政人员共一百一十多人，七日在福州市参加了由中国国民党革命委员会福建省委员会主持的集会，座谈了和平解放台湾问题。
    前任国民党监察院监察委员、福建省教育厅厅长，现任政协福建省委员会委员李黎洲说：“在历史上台湾隶属过福建省，台湾同胞也大部分祖籍福建，所以我们福建省更加关心台湾的解放。我相信不仅台湾同胞爱祖国，绝大多数台湾军政人员也是爱祖国的，我们有责任帮助他们消除顾虑，一起为争取和平解放台湾贡献自己的力量。”
    前国民党海军部次长、第二舰队司令李世甲在会上追述了1949年大陆解放时他彷徨不定的心情后说，事实证明当时解放区所宣称的保障国民党军政人员生命财产，是完全实现了，而且我还看到祖国在突飞猛进。李世甲现任政协福建省委员会委员，在日本投降后他曾任国民党台澎要港司令、在台北参加过日本受降典礼、在左营亲自接受日本舰队。他表示要把他自己的经历和所见到的情况告诉在台湾的老同事、特别是海军人员，告诉他们：只要以国家民族利益为重，爱国不分先后。
    前国民党甘肃省秘书长，七十九岁的翁醉亭说：“中国共产党一向是以国家民族利益为重的，台湾当局只要回溯一下当年西安‘双十二’事变，就可以认识到共产党的诚意。”他希望台湾当局响应“爱国一家”的号召，进行协商、完成祖国的统一。
    在会上发言的，还有前中华学艺社理事、国立编译馆自然科学部部长郑贞文，前国民党海军第二舰队司令部主任参谋林舜藩等多人，他们一致希望他们在台湾的老朋友、老同事响应“爱国一家”的号召，回到祖国怀抱，重新欢聚一堂。
