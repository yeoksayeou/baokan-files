    After a considerable period of preparation, the State Council has issued a decision on wage reform. The wage reform work in enterprises, public institutions, and state organs is about to begin nationwide.

    Wage reform is a major event concerning the development of the national economy and the lives of millions of workers. If this wage reform work is done well, it will better encourage workers materially to exert their labor enthusiasm, improve their professional and technical skills, pay attention to the continuous improvement of labor productivity, and actively strive to complete and overfulfill China's first Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule. We hope that all workers across the country, in various enterprises, public institutions, and state organs, under the leadership of the Party, will jointly do a good job in this wage reform. Leaders of enterprises, public institutions, and state organs should pay attention to listening to the opinions of the masses of workers, accept the supervision of the masses of workers, and strive to do a good job in this wage reform.

    When carrying out wage reform, it would be easier if every worker could understand the spirit of the State Council's decision on wage reform and the wage reform plan embodying the Party and the state's wage policy, and know why wage standards, wage relations, and wage systems are stipulated in this way and not in that way. For example, the speed (amount) of wage increase is a matter of great concern to everyone, and it is necessary to understand that the speed of wage increase is determined by the speed of labor productivity improvement. If labor productivity improves quickly, wages will increase quickly; if labor productivity improves slowly, wages will increase slowly. At the same time, the speed of wage increase must be lower than the speed of labor productivity increase. Because socialist construction requires a certain amount of accumulation to ensure expanded reproduction and guarantee the growth of the state's reserve strength, otherwise, it will be like "sitting and eating the mountains bare," and it will be impossible to build socialism. The wage increase in this wage reform is relatively large, which is the result of the overall improvement of labor productivity and the efforts to increase production by all workers in the past few years. If we want to continue to increase wages in the future, the only way is to further improve labor productivity and continue to work hard to increase production. For example, in the wage reform, the wages of some departments, some regions, and some personnel have increased more, while the wages of other departments, regions, and personnel have increased less. What is the reason for this? It turns out that this is determined based on the principle of "to each according to his work," the state's industrialization policy, and the current wage situation: the wages of heavy industry departments, key construction areas, senior technicians, and senior scientific and technical personnel have been increased more; the wages of primary school teachers, supply and marketing cooperative salespersons, and township cadres with relatively low current wage treatment have also been increased more; other aspects have been increased less. In short, it is necessary to have a correct understanding of the various provisions in the wage reform plan in order to ensure the smooth progress of the wage reform work and achieve satisfactory results.

    The promotion problem of many workers is a prominent issue in this wage reform work. In the past few years, the control over the promotion of workers has been too tight, and some workers' technical and professional abilities have improved, and they should have been promoted but were not. In this wage reform work, it is necessary to solve the problem of workers' promotion. For workers, it is necessary to have a realistic technical grade standard as a basis, and earnestly conduct job assessment and grading work, so that those workers who have made real progress in technology and should be promoted can be promoted. For staff members, a necessary job title table and staffing table should be revised or formulated, and then their wage grades should be assessed according to their respective duties and moral character, talents, and other conditions, so as to make the best use of their talents, each with its own responsibilities, and pay according to work. In this way, through the work of promotion, we can encourage workers to study politics, technology, and culture hard, delve into their profession, strengthen their sense of responsibility for their work, thereby improving labor productivity and increasing production.

    The piece-rate wage system is a good wage form that most easily embodies the socialist principle of "to each according to his work." Whoever works more and better will have their wages increased more, just like immediate results. Therefore, the piece-rate wage system should be consolidated and expanded during and after this wage reform. However, to implement the piece-rate wage system, it is necessary to have a realistic, technically based, and average advanced labor quota. If the labor quota is too high, many workers cannot meet the quota, and they cannot even get the basic wage, then they will not be willing to implement the piece-rate wage system; if the labor quota is too low, it is easy to exceed the quota too much, which will increase product costs, which is unfavorable to both the country and the workers. Therefore, we hope that all industrial departments can formulate practical plans for promoting the piece-rate wage system and unified piece-rate wage regulations. All work that can be done by the piece should strive to implement the piece-rate wage system in all or most of it next year.

    This wage reform is generally carried out on the basis of raising wage standards, which is a good thing for workers to get more wages. However, the phenomenon of work stoppages and idling that often occur in some production plants and mines, especially in some capital construction enterprises, not only prevents workers from getting more wages, but also reduces their wages. Therefore, while carrying out wage reform work, it is also necessary to eliminate the factors that cause work stoppages and idling, such as poor labor organization, untimely supply of raw materials and drawings, etc. Otherwise, although the workers' wage standards have been raised somewhat, their income will be reduced due to the fact that they can only receive layoff allowances during work stoppages, etc. This is detrimental to both the country and the workers and should be avoided.

    The production and supply of daily necessities, especially the production and supply of non-staple foods, is an important issue closely related to wage reform work. Everyone understands that the reason why the masses of workers warmly welcome wage reform is that they hope to get more wages so that they can buy more food, clothing, and things to improve their lives. However, if workers get a little more money but cannot buy what they want to buy; or if those food, clothing, and things, especially non-staple foods, all rise in price with the increase in wages, then what is the actual meaning of increasing wages! Therefore, we ask all competent departments, especially the commercial departments and the people's committees of cities and industrial and mining areas, to work hard to do a good job in the production and supply of consumer goods, especially non-staple foods, in cities and industrial and mining areas, so that the lives of workers are indeed improved due to the increase in wages. All enterprises and the competent departments of enterprises should also attach importance to and do a good job in this work.

    After wage reform and wage increases, will the lives of every worker be significantly improved? Will the difficult problems in the lives of workers be solved easily? Of course, this is not possible. Some problems existing in the lives of some workers, such as housing, medical treatment, and other difficulties, still need to be actively solved in a planned way by various departments, especially the leaders of enterprises and trade union workers. In particular, enterprises should use enterprise bonus funds, employee welfare funds, and labor insurance funds reasonably so that these funds can play a greater role in improving the lives of employees, so that this wage reform can truly achieve its due results, and that the actual income of employees can indeed increase, thereby promoting the continuous upsurge of the national economy.

### 进行工资改革

    进行工资改革
    工资改革的工作经过了相当长时间的准备，现在已由国务院发布了关于工资改革的决定。企业、事业和国家机关的工资改革工作，就要在全国范围内开始进行了。
    工资改革是关系国民经济发展和千百万职工生活的大事。这次工资改革工作作得好，就能够更好地从物质上鼓励职工发挥劳动热情，提高业务技术水平，关心劳动生产率的不断提高，积极争取提前完成和超额完成我国第一个五年计划。我们希望全国各地，各企业、事业单位和国家机关的全体职工，在党的领导下，共同做好这次工资改革工作。各企业、事业单位和国家机关的领导人员，应该注意听取职工群众的意见，接受职工群众的监督，努力作好这次工资改革工作。
    在进行工资改革的时候，如果每一个职工都能够把国务院关于工资改革的决定和体现着党和国家工资政策的工资改革方案的精神弄清楚，知道工资标准，工资关系，工资制度为什么要这样规定，却不那样规定，事情就好办了。譬如说，工资增长的快慢（多少）是大家十分关心的问题，这就需要了解：工资增长的速度决定于劳动生产率提高的速度。劳动生产率提高得快，工资就增长得快；劳动生产率提高得慢，工资就增长得慢。同时，工资增长的速度又必须低于劳动生产率增长的速度。因为社会主义建设需要有一定的积累，来保证扩大再生产和保证国家后备力量的增长，不这样作就会“坐吃山空”，无法建成社会主义。这次工资改革所增加的工资是比较多的，这是由于过去几年全体职工提高了劳动生产率，努力增加生产的结果。要使今后的工资能够继续不断的增加，唯一的办法就是更加提高劳动生产率，继续努力增加生产。又譬如说，在工资改革当中，有些部门、有些地区、有些人员的工资增加得较多，而另外一些部门、地区和人员的工资增加得较少。这是什么道理呢？原来这是根据按劳取酬的原则、国家工业化的政策和现在的工资情况来决定的：对于重工业部门，重点建设地区，高级技术工人和高级科学、技术人员的工资提高得较多；对于现行工资待遇比较低的小学教员，供销合作社营业员和乡干部的工资也提高得较多；其他方面则提高得较少。总之，对于工资改革方案中的各项规定，都需要有正确的了解，才能够使工资改革工作顺利进行，并且收到圆满的效果。
    许多职工的升级问题，是这次工资改革工作中的一个突出问题。过去几年，对于职工的升级控制太紧，有些职工的技术和业务能力提高了，应该升级但没有给他升级。在这次工资改革工作中，需要解决职工的升级问题。对于工人，需要有一个切合实际的技术等级标准作根据，认真地进行考工和评级工作，使那些在技术上确有进步应该升级的工人得到升级。对于职员，应该修订或者制定一个合乎需要的职务名称表和定员表，然后按照每个人所担负的职务和德、才等条件来评定他们的工资等级，作到人尽其才，各有专责，按劳取酬。这样，才能通过升级的工作，鼓励职工努力学习政治、技术和文化，钻研业务，加强对工作的责任心，从而提高劳动生产率，增加生产。
    计件工资制度是最容易体现按劳取酬这个社会主义原则的良好工资形式。谁工作得又多又好，谁的工资也就增加得多，真好比立竿见影一样。因此，在这次工资改革当中和这次工资改革以后，都应该巩固和扩大计件工资制度。但是，要推行计件工资制度，需要有一个切合实际的、有技术根据的、平均先进的劳动定额。如果劳动定额偏高，许多工人达不到定额，连基本工资都拿不到，那他们就不会愿意实行计件工资制度了；如果劳动定额偏低，很容易就超过定额太多，那就会提高产品成本，对于国家和工人都是不利的。因此，我们希望各产业部门都能制定出切实可行的推广计件工资制度的计划和统一的计件工资规程来。凡是能计件的工作，都尽量争取在明年全部或大部实行计件工资制度。
    这次工资改革，一般是在提高工资标准的基础上来进行的，是使工人能够多拿点工资的好事。但是，某些生产厂矿，特别是某些基本建设企业常常发生的停工、窝工现象，不但使工人不能多拿工资，反而要少拿工资。因此，在进行工资改革工作的同时，还必须消除那些造成停工、窝工的因素，如劳动组织不好，原材料、图纸供应不及时等等。否则，工人的工资标准虽然提高了一些，但是因为停工的只能拿停工津贴等等的关系，收入却反而减少了。这是对国家和对工人都不利的事，应该努力避免。
    日常生活必需品的生产和供应问题，特别是副食品的生产和供应问题，是跟工资改革工作有着密切关系的重要问题。谁也明白，职工群众热烈欢迎工资改革，就是希望多得工资，能够多买些吃的、穿的和用的东西，来改善他们的生活。可是，如果职工们多拿到一点钱，却买不到他们愿意买的那些东西；或者那些吃的、穿的和用的东西，特别是副食品，都随着工资的增加而涨价了，那么，增加工资又有什么实际意义呢！因此，我们要求各个主管部门，特别是要求商业部门及城市和工矿区的人民委员会，努力做好城市和工矿区的消费品、特别是副食品的生产和供应工作，使职工的生活确实因为工资的增加而得到改善。各企业单位和企业的主管部门，也应当重视和作好这项工作。
    进行了工资改革，增加了工资，是不是每一个职工的生活就都能够有显著的改善呢？是不是职工生活中的困难问题就都能够迎刃而解呢？当然不可能是这样。若干职工生活中存在的问题，如住宅、疾病医疗等等方面的困难问题，仍然需要各部门，特别是企业的领导人员和工会工作人员有计划地积极地加以解决。企业中尤其应该合理地使用企业奖励基金、职工福利费和劳动保险基金，使这些金钱对于改善职工生活发挥更大的作用，使这次工资改革工作确实能够收到它应有的成果，使职工的实际收入能够确实有所增加，从而促进国民经济的不断高涨。
