Xinhua News Agency, 8th. The State Council issued a directive on the 7th, requiring the People's Committees of all provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the Central Government to correct the coercive practices of banks and credit cooperatives in some areas in attracting deposits and expanding share capital.

The directive, after pointing out the achievements of the work of banks and credit cooperatives, stated that some coercive phenomena occurred in the work of banks and credit cooperatives in some areas this spring. In some places, banks and credit cooperatives, when issuing agricultural loans, distributing rural relief funds, and paying advance purchase deposits and payments for agricultural and sideline products, forcibly deducted various payments from farmers on behalf of relevant departments. The deducted items numbered more than twenty. Some banks and credit cooperatives even forcibly retained a portion of the payments due to farmers as savings deposits or as share capital for credit cooperatives. As a result, farmers received very little cash. In some places, in order to expand investment, agricultural cooperatives asked banks and credit cooperatives to inquire about the purpose of withdrawals when farmers withdrew deposits, restrict withdrawals, and some agricultural cooperatives even mobilized depositors to invest based on farmers' deposit lists. In some places, banks and credit cooperatives implemented unnecessary cash management for agricultural cooperatives, limiting the amount of cash inventory of agricultural cooperatives, and requiring them to deposit cash exceeding the prescribed amount in banks or credit cooperatives; it was stipulated that the income and expenditure of agricultural cooperatives from selling or purchasing goods must be settled through bank and credit cooperative transfers, without giving cash. Some even went so far as to manage the cash of individual farmers and implement transfer settlements. This naturally aroused farmers' doubts, caused great inconvenience to agricultural cooperatives and farmers, and seriously aroused farmers' dissatisfaction.

The directive stated that although the above situation was only a local phenomenon in some areas, and corrective measures had been taken for this phenomenon, many places had not paid enough attention to this issue. The reason for the emergence of this coercive phenomenon is that some comrades have forgotten or ignored the principle of adhering to the voluntary participation of the masses. In addition, it is also related to the fact that the leading organs of these departments have assigned too many and too large tasks, the policy boundaries are not clearly defined, and some financial and economic departments, in an attempt to save themselves trouble, unreasonably require banks and credit cooperatives to handle and deduct payments on their behalf.

In order to correct and prevent this coercive style of work, the directive stipulates:

First, absorbing idle funds is an important task of banks and credit cooperatives. However, banks and credit cooperatives absorbing deposits and credit cooperatives expanding share capital should resolutely implement the principle of voluntarism, so that the masses can deposit freely and withdraw conveniently, and carry out work from the aspects of in-depth publicity, improved services, and convenience for the masses. It is not allowed to coerce in any way, and it is even more forbidden to forcibly convert farmers' deposits into shares of credit cooperatives or investments of agricultural cooperatives.

Second, agricultural loans and rural relief funds issued by the state, as well as the purchase prices and advance purchase deposits of agricultural and sideline products paid by state procurement departments, must be issued and paid to agricultural cooperatives and farmers. Except for advance purchase payments for grain and other agricultural products, which can be settled by the procurement departments when agricultural cooperatives and farmers deliver grain and other agricultural products, no other payments shall be entrusted to banks and credit cooperatives for collection on their behalf.

Third, it is not allowed to limit the amount of cash inventory and implement cash management for agricultural cooperatives. Non-cash settlement for agricultural cooperatives can only be carried out when agricultural cooperatives consider it convenient and truly voluntary. If agricultural cooperatives want to withdraw cash from their deposits, they should be given cash; only if they are willing to transfer accounts can they transfer accounts. Non-cash settlement is not allowed for individual farmers, and transfer checks are not allowed for transactions with farmers.

Fourth, the recovery of overdue agricultural loans should resolutely implement the principle of "borrowing and repaying." Those who have the ability to repay should be recovered on time; those who are truly unable to repay can be postponed or repaid in installments.

    农民存款入股必须出于自愿
    国务院指示纠正银行和信用合作社的强迫命令现象
    新华社8日讯　国务院在七日发出指示，要求各省、自治区、直辖市人民委员会纠正若干地区银行、信用合作社在吸收存款、扩大股金工作中的强迫命令现象。
    指示在指出银行和信用合作社工作的成绩以后说，今年春季若干地区的银行和信用合作社在工作中发生了若干强迫命令的现象。有些地方的银行和信用合作社，在发放农业贷款、发放农村救济款的时候，在支付预购定金、支付农副产品的价款的时候，受有关部门的委托，强行向农民扣回各种款项。扣款的项目达二十多种。甚至有的银行和信用合作社还在应当付出的款项中，硬性扣留一部分作为农民储蓄存款或者作为信用合作社的股金。这样，结果使农民拿不到多少现金。有些地方，农业社为了扩大投资，要求银行和信用合作社在农民提取存款的时候，盘问用途，限制提取，甚至有些农业社还根据农民的存款名单，向存户动员投资。有些地方的银行和信用合作社对农业社实行不必要的现金管理，限定农业社的现金库存数量，要求把超过规定数量的现金，存到银行或者信用合作社；规定农业社出售商品或者购进商品，款项出入一律要经过银行和信用合作社转账结算，不给现金。有的甚至发展到对农民个人的现金也要实行管理，也要实行转帐结算。这样就自然不能不引起农民的疑虑，造成农业社和农民的很大不便，严重地引起农民不满。
    指示中说，上述情况虽然只是某些地方的局部现象，并且对这种现象已采取了纠正的措施，但是还有不少地方并没有足够地注意这个问题。产生这种强迫命令现象的原因，是由于有些同志忘掉或者忽视了坚持群众自愿的原则，另外，同这些部门的领导机关布置任务太多、太大，政策界限交待不清，以及同有些财经部门企图自己省事，不合理地要求银行和信用合作社代办、代扣，也是有关系的。
    为了纠正和防止这种强迫命令的作风，指示中规定：
    第一、吸收闲散资金是银行和信用合作社的一项重要工作。但是银行和信用合作社吸收存款，信用合作社扩大股金，都应当坚决地贯彻执行自愿原则，使群众存款自由，提取方便，从深入宣传、改善服务、便利群众等方面去开展工作，不许以任何方式强迫命令，更不许强行把农民的存款转为信用社的股金或者农业社的投资。
    第二、国家发放的农业贷款、农村救济款和国家采购部门付出的农副产品收购价款和预购定金等，都必须发放和支付到农业社和农民的手中。除了粮食和其他农产品预购款可以在农业社和农民交售粮食和其他农产品的时候，根据采购部门的委托代为清算外，任何其他款项，一概不许委托银行和信用合作社代为扣收。
    第三、对农业社不许限定现金库存数量和实行现金管理。对农业社的非现金结算，只能在农业社认为确实方便、真正出于自愿的情况下才能办理。农业社的存款，愿意支取现金的就给现金，愿意转帐，才能转帐。对农民个人则一律不许实行非现金结算，同农民的交易往来，不许使用转帐支票。
    第四、到期农贷的收回，应当坚决贯彻执行“有借有还”的原则。对于有力偿还的应当按期收回；确实无力偿还的，可以缓期收回或者分期收回。
