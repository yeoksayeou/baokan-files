Consumers' Suggestions:

    Unify Shoe Sizes
    Many shoe factories use "numbers" to calculate shoe sizes, but the numbers are not uniform across factories. The same number shoe from different factories can vary in size, leaving customers unsure of what number shoe to wear. Recently, rubber shoes have adopted a unified national sizing system. It is hoped that relevant departments will also develop a unified sizing system for leather shoes and cloth shoes.

    统一鞋子的尺码
    很多制鞋厂用“号”来计算鞋的尺寸，可是，各鞋厂的号码不统一，不同鞋厂同一个号数的鞋有大有小，闹得顾客不知道究竟穿几号的鞋才好。最近，胶鞋已经有了全国统一的尺码，希望有关部门再制定出皮鞋和布鞋的统一尺码。
