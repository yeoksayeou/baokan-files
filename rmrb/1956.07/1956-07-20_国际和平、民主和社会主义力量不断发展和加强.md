    The international forces of peace, democracy and socialism are constantly developing and strengthening
    Editorial Department of "Pravda"
    In the history of the event-filled post-war period, the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union occupies a particularly important place. This congress of the party, which guides 200 million Soviet people towards communism, formulated a broad program of action, which aroused the vigorous creativity of the Soviet people and brought about major changes in the international situation.
    Since the 20th Congress of the CPSU, thanks to the enthusiastic labor of the Soviet people inspired by communist ideology, the Soviet Union has made great new achievements in all aspects of domestic political, economic, and cultural life. Our international affairs are also developing successfully. International tensions have eased thanks to the Soviet Union's initiative and active participation. Good results have also been achieved in resolving a series of outstanding international issues. The positions of the forces of peace have been greatly consolidated. Practical prerequisites have been created for guaranteeing a solid peace.
    The 20th Congress of the CPSU not only declared that the forces of peace are now strong enough to prevent war, but also mapped out a practical plan to achieve the great and lofty goal of consolidating peace. The realization of this plan will enable mankind to avoid a destructive new war on a larger scale. The principled arguments put forward by the congress on peaceful coexistence between countries with different socio-political systems, on the possibility of preventing war in modern times, and on the diverse forms of transition to socialism in various countries, contribute to strengthening the unity of action of all progressive forces and to further consolidating the positions of the world socialist system.
    The program of peace and international cooperation announced by the 20th Congress of the CPSU has been welcomed and supported not only by the broad masses of people in socialist countries, but also by the broad masses of people in capitalist countries. They see this program as their own and are fighting to realize it.
    The resolutions of the 20th Congress of the CPSU have a significant and growing impact on the world situation, which has caused panic and fury in the camp of the working class's enemies. In order to weaken the beneficial impact of these resolutions on the international situation, they have concentrated all their forces on undermining the plan for peace and cooperation put forward by the 20th Congress of the CPSU to all countries. But the more stubbornly they engage in this conspiracy, the more they expose the anti-popular true conspiracies of the imperialist forces.
    Some American politicians who attempt to lead the entire capitalist world cling to some errors and shortcomings caused in the past by the cult of personality of J. V. Stalin in the Soviet Union, which have been criticized by the 20th Congress of the CPSU and corrected by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. The U.S. State Department has abandoned diplomatic work and has become a staff headquarters for the propaganda campaign it has launched around the cult of personality. The purpose of this movement is to slander the great ideas of Marxism-Leninism, undermine the working people's trust in the world's first socialist country, the Soviet Union, and cause discord and confusion in the ranks of the international communist movement and the workers' movement.
    Facts show that what we are encountering now is not the usual propaganda campaign of the kind that the U.S. State Department organized quite a few of in the "Cold War" years; the current movement is a new political plan, extensively planned, in which the American reactionary group places great hope.
    The agents of the U.S. monopoly organizations know that, under the current circumstances, the proposition of capitalist restoration will not find much support in the people's democratic countries, so they have chosen a more cunning method. They use their espionage agencies, rely on the remnants of the defeated, anti-communist exploiting classes, and attempt to lure some loyal but politically inexperienced people into their nets, they strive to provoke chauvinistic sentiments, undermine relations between socialist countries, and provoke dissension between them. The imperialists attempt to weaken the socialist countries in this way in order to turn to widespread sabotage activities against the people's regime and the socialist system.
    The imperialist propagandists also intend to use similar methods against the communist parties in capitalist countries, and they try to undermine the international ties between the workers' movements of various countries. The vicious enemy of communism, Dulles, is prepared to swear that he is not generally opposed to the communist parties, but only to their "too close" ties with the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.
    Obviously, Dulles and his ilk cannot understand that their false "concern" for the "independence" of the people's democratic countries and communist parties of various countries can only arouse the vigilance of the supporters of peace, democracy and socialism against the enemies' conspiracies. However, we would make a big mistake if we underestimated the enemies' new conspiracies. It should not be forgotten that there are still opportunists in some places, and the enemies of the working people undoubtedly place their hopes on them. It must also be remembered that among those who are politically immature and too credulous, there may be people who will fall for the tricks of so-called "national communism," so-called "superfluous" international ties between communist parties of various countries, and so on.
    The socialist world system is a consolidated and unbreakable big family composed of many countries. The countries that now make up the socialist world system have broken away from capitalism after a long and arduous liberation struggle by the working class and peasants against the oppressors. Inspired by Leninism, the ever-vigorous and constantly developing doctrine of transforming the world, the communist and workers' parties have consistently led the people of these countries forward along the correct path of social and national liberation.
    Before the Second World War, countries like Poland, Romania, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Albania had underdeveloped industries and backward agriculture. Ruling these countries were fascist and semi-fascist regimes that brutally oppressed the working people. Foreign monopoly capital controlled their national economies. Socialist construction has enabled these countries and other people's democratic countries to end their previous economic backwardness forever, establish heavy industry, and achieve a surge of national culture.
    It is worth noting that the formerly backward Eastern European countries, which are now advancing along the socialist road, are closely catching up with the economically developed Western European countries in terms of the scale of production in the most important sectors of heavy industry.
    The socialist construction of the People's Republic of China is developing by leaps and bounds, and the worker-peasant alliance is constantly being consolidated. The Chinese industrialization plan, which was recently described by many bourgeois "prophets" as an unrealizable fantasy, is being continuously overfulfilled. The agricultural collectivization plan is also being successfully implemented.
    All this shows that all the people's democratic countries have made new and great progress on the socialist road, and that the socialist world system continues to consolidate.
    The communist construction of the Soviet Union and the socialist construction of the people's democratic countries are a unified process of the people of these countries moving towards a new life. It is quite natural that fraternal and friendly relations based on common political and economic development and common ultimate goals have been established between socialist countries (regardless of size). The communist and workers' parties, which hold high the banner of Leninism and the banner of friendship between the peoples of all countries, play a decisive role in uniting socialist countries.
    The resolutions of the 20th Congress of the CPSU have historical significance for consolidating the entire socialist camp. The "People's Daily," the organ of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, wrote in its editorial: "The convening of the 20th Congress of the CPSU is a historical event of world significance. This congress creatively applied Marxism-Leninism and will guide the Soviet people to victory on the road to communism, and promote the peace-loving people all over the world to make further struggles to stop a new war. The Chinese people, who are engaged in socialist construction, will unite with the Soviet people and the people of all countries, work together, and make new contributions to the lofty cause of world peace and human progress."
    The great ideas of peace and human progress for which socialist countries are striving are receiving increasingly broad support around the world. Therefore, it is no accident that the people of all countries who have recently shaken off the oppression of colonialism, as well as the people of all countries who are striving for national independence and freedom, have found a common language with socialist countries. The interests of defending peace and democracy and fighting against imperialist aggression and reactionary forces unite them together.
    The recent congress of the Korean Workers' Party and the Albanian Labor Party, the conference of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia, the conference of the German Socialist Unity Party, and the plenary sessions of the Central Committees of the communist and workers' parties of other people's democratic countries, all unanimously supported the resolutions of the 20th Congress of the CPSU.
    In all socialist countries, the political activity and labor enthusiasm of the masses of the people—the true creators of history—are now constantly increasing. The resolute and principled struggle against the cult of personality and its consequences has made it possible to greatly develop the initiative and combat effectiveness of all communists, strictly follow the Leninist norms of party life, quickly eliminate errors and shortcomings in the development of the economy and culture, correct the violations of socialist legality, and, in short, give the broad masses of the people room to develop their infinite creativity on the basis of developing socialist democracy.
    It was precisely after the Twentieth Party Congress that the fraternal communist and workers' parties of the people's democratic countries intensified their efforts to creatively apply Marxism-Leninism in conjunction with the specific conditions of their own countries. Lenin foresaw long ago that the paths of various countries to socialism are consistent and common in principle and in the main aspects, but the ways of transition to socialism will not be exactly the same; each nation will have its own characteristics in terms of the forms of democracy, the forms of the dictatorship of the proletariat, and the speed of socialist transformation in all aspects of social life.
    Under the leadership of the Communist Party, the people of free countries creatively apply Marxism in their own conditions and move towards a great goal—communism. It is impossible to move towards such a great goal through separation and division. The working people of various countries in the socialist system are moving towards this goal hand in hand in unity. No one can destroy this unity. Necessary consideration of national characteristics will not only not alienate countries building socialism, but will instead promote their unity.
    However, some figures in the United States will never understand the historical law that the socialist system of the Soviet Union, People's China, and various people's democratic countries is strengthening. They still do not give up their illusion of returning to the "good old days" when the capitalists of the United States, Britain, France, and Germany were in charge in China, Poland, Hungary, and other countries that have now embarked on the road of independent development.
    The imperialists hope that in the context of further development of socialist democracy and criticism and self-criticism in these countries, their agents can spread their poisonous seeds. For example, the discussion in the Petofi group in Hungary was used to achieve this goal. Some elements who were influenced by foreign imperialist groups and opposed the policies of the Hungarian Working People's Party attempted to spread their anti-party views under the guise of discussion, thus being used by the enemies of the people's Hungary.
    The free people saw through the enemies wearing new masks, exposed them, and rendered them harmless. At the same time, it cannot be ignored that wherever the political work and ideological education work for the masses is weak, the enemies' agents will immediately take advantage of this opportunity to carry out activities. In this regard, we should remember the provocative incident that occurred in Poznań not long ago.
    Now, everyone knows that this provocative incident was created by the enemies' agents. The American newspapers even felt that it was not necessary to cover up the direct connection between the Poznań incident and the "cold war" command center across the ocean. It was previously reported that the New York "American Daily" shamelessly and frankly stated on June 30: "The Senate decided to allocate 25 million U.S. dollars within the scope of foreign aid to fund secret activities behind the Iron Curtain, such as those that caused the Poznań riots."
    The provocateurs of the Poznań incident basely took advantage of the temporary difficulties in Poland's progress. There are still certain difficulties in the people's democratic countries, which are due to the profound transformation of the entire national economy, the need for massive investment, and the elimination of the destruction caused by the war and the Hitlerite occupiers. For example, there are also individual errors in planning, which sometimes result in an imbalance in the development of certain sectors of the national economy. These errors are being successfully overcome. However, the enemies of the working class are attempting to use these difficulties and shortcomings to achieve anti-people's goals, especially in places where the political work of the communist and workers' parties is weak. Many of those who were deceived in the hostile provocative incident in Poznań obviously did not know who was inciting them. The reason why such a thing could happen is only because there are some people in the people's democratic countries who do not understand that as long as there are class forces hostile to the socialist system in these countries, these forces may seize the opportunity to actively oppose the people's democratic system, attempt to pull the wavering and insufficiently steadfast elements to their side, especially because enemies overseas are doing their best to organize various provocative actions, and they will continue to do so in the future. The workers, peasants, and intellectuals of the people's democratic countries who defend their achievements will undoubtedly learn this lesson and will stop the evil agents of the enemies of the working class and the imperialists.
    The failure of the Poznań provocative incident, which was unanimously condemned by the Polish people, made those who still dream of reviving the old system in the people's democratic countries despondent. In this regard, it is worth noting that the British bourgeois newspapers very clearly condemned Dulles for rehashing the old tune in his recent speech, advocating the old plan of forcibly changing the social system of the people's democratic countries. London emphasized that adventures like the Poznań incident are hopeless and are merely a "waste of effort."
    Even the thoroughly bad adventurer, General Bór-Komorowski, whose notorious role in the Warsaw Uprising of 1944 is well-known, had to admit that the people's democratic system is solid. Bór-Komorowski called the Poznań incident "hopeless." Hasn't the fact that two prime ministers of the exiled "government" and hundreds of prominent exiles have returned to Poland shown that even the most stubborn opponents of the people's democratic system have lost confidence in the possibility of restoring the old system?
    The imperialist gentlemen should have understood long ago that the big family of socialist countries, which is the historical achievement of the people of all countries, is solid and unbreakable. This big family guarantees the national independence of socialist countries, strengthens their international position, and enables them to continuously develop their national economy and improve the living standards of the working people.
    The relations between socialist countries are solid because these relations are based on the principles of fraternal friendship, equality, non-interference in internal affairs, and comprehensive mutual assistance. The policies of threats, pressure, and various provocations pursued by imperialist countries will only prompt socialist countries to unite more closely.
    Comrade Mao Zedong wrote when talking about the upsurge of socialist forces: "Now the Soviet Union has reached such strength, the Chinese people's revolution has won such a great victory, the construction of various people's democratic countries has had such great achievements, the movement of the people of all countries against oppression and aggression has such an upsurge, and the front of our friendship and unity is so consolidated, so it can be completely asserted that we are not afraid of any imperialist aggression. Any imperialist aggression will be crushed by us, and all despicable provocations are completely useless."
    Socialist countries are overcoming the difficulties in the process of progress by relying on mutual help and support, and are confidently advancing along the road of strengthening the world socialist system and consolidating world peace.
    The people of these countries are closely united around the long-tested communist parties and the people's governments who have been tempered in the struggle for socialism, and are jointly determined to sacredly protect and defend their great achievements, and they will resolutely fight back against all provocations by the enemies of socialism. In these countries, the collective leadership elected from among the masses of the people is fully supported by the working people, and at the same time relies on this support to properly organize the creative and constructive labor of the workers, peasants, and working intellectuals in building a socialist society. The consolidation of the people's democratic system, the fundamental changes in the international situation that are conducive to peace and democratic forces, are destined to make any attempt by reactionary forces to undermine the socialist construction of the people's democratic countries and turn them back to the capitalist road doomed to failure.
    Now the world is on the eve of a new great upsurge and consolidation of the democratic movement, and on the eve of the working people strengthening the unity of their ranks in the struggle for a better future. The resolutions of the 20th Congress of the CPSU have opened up great prospects for the unity of all forces striving for peace and socialism. The communist parties of various countries play a major role in this regard.
    The communist parties of some capitalist countries have experienced the severe test of war, have been tempered in the struggle against fascism, and have grown stronger in the struggle for peace, freedom, and national independence during the post-war period, so they have gained rich historical experience. The working people know that the communists are the staunch defenders of the people's interests. In France and Italy, the communists have become a huge force in parliament. The attempts by the imperialist reactionary forces to isolate the communist parties, restrict their activities, or force them to go underground have not yielded any results.
    The masses of working people of all strata are increasingly and irresistibly eager to strengthen unity. The unity of the working class (including the workers who follow the communists and socialists) is necessary for winning the struggle for international peace and the struggle for guaranteeing the daily interests of the working class and the entire working people.
    The real possibility of establishing unity among all democratic forces and increasing the influence of the communist parties has deeply disturbed the enemies of the working class, all reactionaries, those who are enthusiastic about the "cold war," and the crusaders against communism. Therefore, the reactionary forces in capitalist countries are now mainly counting on splitting the international workers' movement. This is an important direction of attack for all the forces of imperialist reaction.
    The enemies of the working class fantasize about splitting the communist parties, weakening their international ties, especially their ties with the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and trying to isolate the various bases of the international workers' movement before attacking them.
    What do the politicians and thinkers of imperialist reaction hope for?
    First of all, they think that since some international workers' organizations such as the Communist International and the Communist Information Bureau have ceased their activities, internationalist unity must have weakened, and the contact between the revolutionary fraternal parties standing on the position of Marxism-Leninism must have been destroyed.
    Secondly, they hope that since the communist parties are carrying out their activities in accordance with the national characteristics and conditions of their own countries, reflecting the national interests of their own people, they seem to forget the great responsibility of international proletarian solidarity, and forget that the working classes of all countries should be concerned about strengthening internationalist solidarity.
    This kind of hope of the international reactionaries will inevitably be bankrupt.
    Only a few muddleheads in the ranks of the workers' movement (who get lost between three pine trees, and who only see the trees but not the forest), only opportunists who forget the great goals of the working class, will forget the internationalist solidarity of the proletariat in their actions. The entire life experience and the entire class struggle experience teach the working class to recognize the profound significance of proletarian solidarity. This thought has always been the unshakable cornerstone of the proletarian worldview.
    The Marxist parties of the working class have followed the principles of international proletarian solidarity in their entire activities in the past and now. Marxism-Leninism teaches us that the correctly understood national interests of the working people do not contradict their internationalist socialist interests. Lenin pointed out most forcefully in his famous article "On the National Pride of the Great Russians" that the interests of correctly understanding the national pride of the Great Russian people are consistent with the socialist interests of the proletarians of the Great Russian and all other nationalities.
    Forgetting internationalist ties will ultimately make the national interests of the working people suffer greatly, and there will be no other result, because the most important summary in modern history is the conclusion that proletarian internationalism is the sharpest weapon of the working class and the entire working people in the struggle against all kinds of oppression, in the struggle of the people of all countries to solve the tasks of gaining freedom and national independence, and in the struggle to solve the tasks of building socialism and communism.
    Proletarian internationalism is the great slogan of the Marxist parties, which is in line with its entire world view and reflects its policies. Since the publication of the "Communist Manifesto" by Marx and Engels, the call "Workers of all countries, unite!" has been the most important slogan of the workers' movement for more than a hundred years, and the strength and prosperity of the workers' movement lies in unity and unification.
    In the struggle to safeguard the interests of the working class and the entire working people, in the struggle against the threat of a new war, in the struggle against the anti-people's forces of monopoly capital, and in the struggle against colonial oppression, the fundamental consistency of the interests of all workers' Marxist parties is the solid foundation of proletarian internationalism. The consolidation of internationalist ties is a historical necessity for the workers' parties of socialist countries and for all Marxist parties of capitalist countries, and it is the guarantee for the further victorious development of the entire international workers' movement.
    Now, the imperialists are trying to assemble all reactionary forces into a unified anti-communist front by piecing together military blocs, tying up weaker capitalist countries with a system of enslaving financial subordination, and using levers such as the powerful machine of international monopoly organizations. In this case, the ideological unity and international solidarity of all Marxist and revolutionary working class parties is of particular significance. All fraternal communist parties and the Communist Party of the Soviet Union deeply understand this.
    The communist parties of capitalist countries are giving an increasingly resolute counterattack to the destructive conspiracies of the imperialist groups, and are step by step exposing the current slander campaign of the enemies of the working class who are trying to split the international workers' movement.
    The resolution of the Central Committee of the CPSU on June 30 "On Overcoming the Cult of Personality and Its Consequences" is of great significance to this historically significant struggle of the communist parties of all countries against the conspiracies of the imperialist reactionary forces. The "Humanity," the organ of the French Communist Party, correctly believes that this resolution is "an extremely significant new contribution to the activities of the international workers' movement for peace and socialism."
    The resolution of the Central Committee of the CPSU on June 30 clarified the current stage in the history of the workers' movement by applying Marxism-Leninism. The slanderers against the Soviet Union and communism have suffered a fatal blow. They now do not know where to hide, just like a rabbit encountering bright lights on the road. The enemies of the working class cannot cover up their panic.
    As for the communist parties of capitalist countries, they are raising the glorious, Marxist-Leninist, proletarian internationalist banner even higher. The Central Committee of the French Communist Party warmly supported the resolution of the Central Committee of the CPSU. Comrade Togliatti, the general secretary of the Italian Communist Party, expressed "unconditional support for the work done by the leaders of the CPSU in the past and now in the Soviet Union and in the international workers' movement to completely eliminate the consequences of the cult of Stalin's personality." The recent talks between the delegations of the communist parties of France, Italy, Belgium, and Britain and the leaders of the CPSU were conducted in an atmosphere of sincerity and in the spirit of sincere friendship and mutual understanding between the fraternal parties. These talks promoted the fraternal unity of the Marxist parties of the workers of various countries, and strengthened the ties and cooperation between them.
    The Central Committee of the Communist Party of India said in its resolution: The resolution of the Central Committee of the CPSU on June 30 correctly pointed out the conspiracies and tricks of the enemies of the working people, and emphasized that it is necessary to be loyal to the scientific thought of Marxism-Leninism and the cause of proletarian internationalism.
    In the struggle for peace and socialism, the idea of internationalist unity is grasped by the masses of the working people and becomes a great historical force of modern times. That is why the conspiracies of the enemies of the working class are doomed to be bankrupt. That is why they cannot destroy the proletarian internationalism. The last few sentences of the resolution of the Central Committee of the CPSU on June 30 are permeated with deep confidence in the strength of communism, and these sentences seem particularly powerful and confident today. The last few sentences of the resolution of the Central Committee of the CPSU on June 30 said: "Let the bourgeois thinkers make up the myth of the 'crisis' of communism and the 'confusion' of the communist ranks. We are used to hearing such spells from the enemies. Their predictions always turn into bubbles in the end. These unfortunate predictors appeared and disappeared, while the communist movement, the immortal and vigorous Marxist-Leninist thought, continues to win victories. It will still be the case in the future. Any malicious 'slanderous attacks' by our enemies cannot stop the irresistible historical development process of mankind towards communism."

    国际和平、民主和社会主义力量不断发展和加强
    “真理报”编辑部
    在充满事件的战后时期的历史中，苏联共产党第二十次代表大会占特别重要的地位。这次引导着两亿苏联人民走向共产主义的党代表大会拟定了一个广泛的行动纲领，这个纲领引起苏联人民的创造力的蓬勃高涨，并且使国际局势发生重大变化。
    在苏共第二十次代表大会以后，由于在共产主义思想鼓舞下的苏联人民的热情澎湃的劳动，苏联在国内政治、经济和文化生活各方面取得了巨大的新成就。我国的国际事务也在成功地发展。根据苏联的倡议和在它的积极参加下，国际紧张局势有了缓和。在解决一系列悬而未决的国际问题方面也取得了良好的结果。和平力量的阵地大大地巩固起来。已经为保障巩固的和平创造了实际的前提。
    苏共第二十次代表大会不仅宣布，现在和平力量已经十分强大，足够防止战争，而且规划出达到巩固和平这一伟大崇高的目标的实际计划。这个计划的实现将使人类可以避免破坏性的更大的新战争。代表大会所提出的关于社会—政治制度不同的国家和平共处、关于现代防止战争的可能性以及关于各国向社会主义过渡的多种形式等原则性的论点，有助于加强全体进步力量的行动一致，有助于进一步巩固世界社会主义体系的阵地。
    苏共第二十次代表大会所宣布的和平和国际合作的纲领不仅受到社会主义国家广大人民群众的欢迎和支持，而且受到资本主义国家广大人民群众的欢迎和支持。他们把这个纲领看成是自己的纲领，并且为实现这个纲领而奋斗。
    苏联共产党第二十次代表大会的决议对世界局势具有重大的和越来越大的影响，这在工人阶级的敌人的营垒中引起了恐慌和暴怒。为了削弱这些决议对国际局势的良好影响，他们集中了一切力量来破坏苏共第二十次代表大会向各国提出的和平和合作的计划。但是，他们越顽强地搞这一勾当，就越发暴露了帝国主义势力的反人民的真正阴谋。
    企图领导整个资本主义世界的一些美国政治家，死抓住由于在苏联对约·维·斯大林的崇拜而在过去产生的一些错误和缺点，这些错误和缺点已经受到了苏共第二十次代表大会的指责，已经被苏联共产党中央委员会纠正。美国国务院放下外交工作，却变成了一个为它围绕个人崇拜所发动的展开的宣传运动的参谋部。这个运动的目的是：毁谤马克思列宁主义的伟大思想，破坏劳动人民对世界上第一个社会主义国家——苏联的信任，在国际共产主义运动和工人运动的队伍中引起不睦和混乱。
    事实说明，现在我们碰到的不是美国国务院在“冷战”年代中组织了不少的那种通常的宣传运动，现在的运动是美国反动集团寄予很大希望的、经过广泛谋划的新的政治计划。
    美国垄断组织的代理人知道，在现在的情况下，资本主义复辟的主张在人民民主国家中不会找到多少支持者，于是他们选了更狡猾的办法。他们利用自己的间谍机关，依靠已被击溃的、敌视共产主义的剥削阶级残余并企图把一些忠诚的、但是在政治上锻炼不够的人诱到自己的罗网中，他们竭力挑拨沙文主义的情绪，破坏社会主义国家之间的关系，挑起它们之间的分歧。帝国主义分子企图用这种办法来削弱社会主义国家，以便转而对人民政权和社会主义制度进行广泛的破坏活动。
    帝国主义的宣传家对资本主义国家的共产党也打算用这类办法，他们力图破坏各国人民工人运动之间的国际联系。共产主义的凶恶敌人杜勒斯准备宣誓说，他并不一般地反对共产党，只是反对它们同苏联共产党的“太密切的”联系。
    显然，杜勒斯和他的同道者不能理解，他们的这种虚假的“关怀”各人民民主国家和各国共产党的“独立性”。只能引起和平、民主和社会主义的拥护者对敌人的阴谋的警惕。但是，如果我们对敌人的新的阴谋估计不足，那我们就犯了很大的错误。不应该忘记，有些地方还存在有机会主义分子，劳动人民的敌人毫无疑问对他们寄予希望。还必须记住，在政治上不够成熟和过于轻信的人中间可以找到这样的人，他们会中所谓“民族共产主义”、所谓各国共产党之间的国际联系是“多余的”等等这类漂亮言词的诡计。
    社会主义世界体系是由许多国家组成的巩固的、牢不可破的大家庭。现在组成社会主义世界体系的各国，在经过工人阶级和农民反对压迫者的长时期的艰苦的解放斗争后，已经摆脱资本主义。共产党和工人党为列宁主义，即为改造世界的永远生气勃勃、不断发展的学说的思想所鼓舞，始终如一地领导这些国家的人民沿着社会和民族解放的正确道路前进。
    在第二次世界大战前，像波兰、罗马尼亚、匈牙利、保加利亚和阿尔巴尼亚这样一些国家，它们的工业不发达、农业落后。统治这些国家的是残酷压迫劳动人民的法西斯政权和半法西斯政权。外国垄断资本控制了它们的国家经济。社会主义建设使得这些国家和其他一些人民民主国家得以永远地结束了以前的经济落后状况，建立起重工业，取得民族文化的高涨。
    值得注意的是，以前落后的、而现在沿着社会主义道路前进的东欧国家在重工业最重要部门的生产规模上紧紧地赶上经济发达的西欧国家。
    中华人民共和国的社会主义建设正在飞跃地发展，工农联盟在不断巩固。不久前还被许多资产阶级“预言家”说成是实现不了的空想的中国工业化计划在不断超额完成。农业集体化计划也在胜利地实现。
    这一切说明所有人民民主国家在社会主义道路上有了新的、大大的进展，说明社会主义世界体系在继续巩固。
    苏联的共产主义建设和人民民主国家的社会主义建设是这些国家的人民向新生活前进的统一的过程。在社会主义国家（不分大小）之间建立了以共同的政治和经济发展和共同的最终目标为基础的兄弟般的友好关系，这是十分自然的。高举着列宁主义的旗帜和各国人民友好的旗帜的共产党和工人党在团结社会主义国家中起着决定性作用。
    苏共第二十次代表大会的决议对巩固整个社会主义阵营具有历史性意义。中国共产党中央委员会机关报“人民日报”在社论中写道：“苏共第二十次代表大会的召开，是具有世界意义的历史事件。这个大会创造性地运用了马克思列宁主义，将引导苏联人民胜利地走向共产主义，并且推动全世界爱好和平的人士为制止新战争而作进一步的斗争。正在进行社会主义建设的中国人民，将同苏联人民和各国人民团结一致，共同努力，为世界和平和人类进步的崇高事业作出新的贡献。”
    社会主义各国为之奋斗的和平和人类进步的伟大思想在世界各地受到越来越广泛的支持。因此，不久前挣脱殖民主义的压迫的各国人民以及正在争取民族独立和自由的各国人民找到了同社会主义国家共同的语言，这不是偶然的。保卫和平和民主的利益以及为反对帝国主义的侵略和反动势力而斗争的利益使他们团结在一起。
    不久前举行的朝鲜劳动党代表大会和阿尔巴尼亚劳动党代表大会、捷克斯洛伐克共产党代表会议、德国统一社会党代表会议以及其他人民民主国家的共产党和工人党中央委员会全体会议，都一致支持苏共第二十次代表大会的决议。
    在所有社会主义国家中，人民群众——历史的真正创造者的政治积极性和劳动积极性现在正在不断提高。为反对个人崇拜及其后果而进行的坚决的和原则性的斗争，使得有可能大力发挥所有共产党人的积极性和战斗力，严格遵循列宁主义的党内生活准则，迅速地消除在发展经济和文化中的错误和缺点，纠正对社会主义法制的破坏，总之，在发扬社会主义民主的基础上给予广大人民群众以发挥无穷无尽的创造力的余地。
    正是在第二十次党代表大会以后，人民民主国家的兄弟共产党和工人党加紧致力于结合本国的特殊条件创造性地运用马克思列宁主义。列宁早就预见到：各国走向社会主义的道路在基本上、在主要的方面是一致的、共同的，但是向社会主义过渡的方式将不完全一样；在民主的形式方面，在无产阶级专政的形式方面，在社会生活各方面的社会主义改造的速度方面，每个民族都会有自己的特点。
    自由国家的人民在共产党的领导下，在本国的条件下创造性地运用马克思主义，走向一个伟大的目标——共产主义。各自分散和分离，是不能走向这样一个伟大的目标的。社会主义体系的各国劳动人民团结一致地手牵着手地向这个目标迈进。谁也不能够破坏这种团结。对本国特点的必要的考虑，不仅不会使建设社会主义的国家疏远，反而会促进它们的团结。
    但是，美国的某些人物无论如何不会理解苏联、人民中国和各人民民主国家的社会主义制度加强的历史规律性。他们仍旧不放弃他们回到“往昔的好时光”的幻想，那时候，美国、英国、法国、德国的资本家在中国、波兰、匈牙利等现在已走上独立发展道路的国家中当家作主。
    帝国主义分子指望，在这些国家进一步发扬社会主义民主和开展批评和自我批评的情况下，他们的特务能散播他们的有毒种子。例如，在匈牙利的裴多菲小组中的讨论就被利用来达到这一目的。有些受了帝国主义集团外来影响的、反对匈牙利劳动人民党政策的分子企图假讨论之名散播自己的反党观点，这样就被人民匈牙利的敌人所利用。
    自由人民识破了戴着新面具的敌人，揭露了他们，使他们无能为害。同时，不能不看到：凡是对群众的政治工作和思想教育工作薄弱的地方，敌人的特务就马上利用这种机会进行活动。在这方面应当记住不久前在波兹南发生的挑衅事件。
    现在，大家都知道，这个挑衅事件是敌人的特务一手制造的。美国报纸甚至认为没有必要掩盖波兹南事件同大洋彼岸的“冷战”指挥中心有直接联系。前已报道，纽约“美国人日报”在六月三十日厚颜无耻、直言不讳地说：“参议院决定在援助外国的范围内拨款两千五百万美元，资助铁幕后面的、像造成波兹南骚乱事件的那种秘密活动。”
    波兹南事件的挑衅者卑鄙地利用了波兰前进中的暂时的困难。在人民民主国家还存在一定的困难，这些困难是由于对整个国民经济进行深刻的改造、由于必须大量投资、由于在消除战争和希特勒占领者所造成的破坏而产生的。例如在计划方面也有个别错误，结果有时造成国民经济某些部门的发展不平衡。这些错误正在胜利地克服中。但是，工人阶级的敌人为了达到反人民的目的而企图利用这些困难和缺点，特别是在共产党和工人党政治工作薄弱的地方。在波兹南敌对挑衅事件中受愚弄的许多人显然不知道是谁在煽动他们。所以能够发生这样的事情，只是因为在人民民主国家里有一些人不了解：只要在这些国家里还存在敌视社会主义制度的阶级力量，这些力量就可能伺机积极反对人民民主制度，企图把动摇的、不够坚定的分子拉到他们一边，尤其是因为海外的敌人竭力组织各种挑衅行动，今后他们还会这样做。人民民主国家的捍卫自己成果的工人、农民和知识分子无疑地会汲取这一教训，会制止工人阶级的敌人和帝国主义者的罪恶代理人。
    遭到波兰人民一致痛斥的波兹南挑衅事件的失败使那些仍旧梦想在人民民主国家复活旧制度的人垂头丧气。在这方面值得注意的是，英国资产阶级报纸十分明显地谴责杜勒斯，因为他在最近的言论中重弹老调，鼓吹从前的那一套强力改变人民民主国家的社会制度的计划。伦敦着重指出，像波兹南事件那种冒险是没有希望的，这只是“枉费精力”。
    甚至像在1944年华沙暴动时期起决定作用的臭名不小的布尔—柯马罗夫斯基将军那样的坏透了的冒险家也不得不承认，人民民主制度是巩固的。布尔—柯马罗夫斯基把波兹南事件称为是“没有希望的”。难道流亡“政府”的两个总理和几百名著名的流亡人士返回波兰的事情还没有说明，甚至人民民主制度的最顽固的反对者也对恢复旧制度的可能性丧失了信心吗？
    帝国主义老爷们早就应当明了，作为各国人民历史成果的社会主义国家大家庭是巩固的，牢不可破的。这个大家庭保障社会主义国家的民族独立，加强它们的国际地位，使它们有可能不断发展国民经济和提高劳动人民的生活水平。
    社会主义国家之间的关系之所以巩固，是因为这些关系建立在兄弟友谊、平等、互不干涉内政和全面相互援助的原则上。帝国主义国家奉行的威胁、施压力和各种挑衅的政策只会促使社会主义各国更加团结一致。
    毛泽东同志在谈到社会主义力量的高涨的时候写道：“现在苏联已达到这样的强大，中国人民革命已获得这样的伟大胜利，各人民民主国家的建设已有这样的巨大成就，世界各国人民的反压迫反侵略的运动已有这样的高涨，而我们的友谊和团结的阵线又是这样的巩固，所以，完全可以断言，对于任何帝国主义的侵略，我们都是不怕的。任何帝国主义的侵略都将被我们所粉碎，一切卑鄙的挑拨都是完全没有用的。”
    社会主义国家依靠相互的帮助和支持克服前进过程中的困难，正满怀信心地沿着加强世界社会主义体系和巩固世界和平的道路前进。
    这些国家的人民紧紧地团结在久经考验的和在争取社会主义的斗争中得到锻炼的共产党和人民政府的周围，共同怀着不可动摇的决心来神圣地保护和捍卫自己的伟大的胜利果实，他们对社会主义的敌人的种种挑衅将给以坚决的反击。在这些国家中，从人民群众中间所推举的集体领导受到劳动人民的充分支持，同时依靠这种支持来妥善地组织建设社会主义社会的工人、农民和劳动知识分子进行创造性建设性的劳动。人民民主制度的巩固，国际局势有利于和平和民主力量的根本变化，都注定反动势力打算破坏人民民主国家的社会主义建设并且使它们回头走资本主义道路的任何企图都要遭到失败。
    现在世界处于民主运动新的巨大高涨和巩固的前夜，处在劳动人民在争取美好前途的斗争中加强他们队伍的团结的前夜。苏共第二十次代表大会的决议已经为一切争取和平和社会主义的力量的团结打开了伟大的远景。各国共产党在这一方面起着重大的作用。
    一些资本主义国家的共产党经历了战争的严重考验，在反抗法西斯主义的斗争中得到了锻炼，战后期间在争取和平、自由和民族独立的斗争中更加成长起来，因而它们获得了丰富的历史经验。劳动人民知道共产党人是人民利益的坚定的保卫者。在法国和意大利，共产党人已经成为议会中的巨大力量。帝国主义反动势力打算孤立共产党、限制它们的活动或者迫使它们转入地下的这些企图，都没有得到任何结果。
    各阶层劳动群众越来越不可遏制地渴望加强团结。工人阶级（包括跟随共产党人和社会党人走的工人）的团结是争取国际和平的斗争、争取保障工人阶级和全体劳动人民的日常利益的斗争取得胜利所必需的。
    所有民主力量建立团结的现实可能性、共产党影响的增长，使工人阶级的敌人、所有反动分子、热中“冷战”的人和反对共产主义的十字军武士深感不安。因此，资本主义国家反动势力现在主要是指望分裂国际工人运动。这是帝国主义反动派全部力量的重要打击方向。
    工人阶级的敌人幻想分裂共产党、削弱它们的国际联系，首先是同苏联共产党的联系，力图孤立国际工人运动的各个基地，而后进攻它们。
    帝国主义反动派的政客和思想家希望的是什么呢？
    他们首先这样想，既然像共产国际和共产党情报局这样一些工人阶级国际组织已经停止活动，那么国际主义团结一定削弱，站在马克思列宁主义立场上的革命兄弟政党之间的接触一定破坏。
    其次，他们希望，既然共产党在进行自己的活动时根据本国民族特点和条件，反映自己人民的民族利益，那么好像就会忘记国际无产阶级团结这一伟大职责，会忘记各国工人阶级都应该关心加强的国际主义团结。
    国际反动派的这种指望必将遭到不可避免的破产。
    只有工人运动队伍中的个别糊涂虫（他们在三棵松树中间就会迷路，他们永远只见树木不见森林），只有忘记工人阶级伟大目标的机会主义分子，才会在自己的行动中忘记无产阶级国际主义团结。整个生活经验、整个阶级斗争的经验教导工人阶级认识到无产阶级团结的深刻意义。这种思想从来就是无产阶级世界观的不可动摇的基石。
    工人阶级的马克思主义政党在自己的整个活动中过去和现在都遵循着国际无产阶级团结的原则。马克思列宁主义教导我们说，正确理解的劳动人民的民族利益同他们的国际主义社会主义利益不会有矛盾。列宁在自己一篇有名的文章“论大俄罗斯人底民族自傲心”中最强有力地指出，正确理解大俄罗斯人民族自傲精神的利益是同大俄罗斯的以及其他一切民族的无产者的社会主义利益一致的。
    忘记国际主义联系最终必然会使劳动人民的民族利益大吃苦头，不会有别的结果，因为现代史中最重要的总结就是这样一个结论：无产阶级国际主义是工人阶级和全体劳动人民在反对各种压迫的斗争中、在各国人民解决获得自由、民族独立的任务中、在解决建成社会主义和共产主义的任务中最锐利的武器。
    无产阶级国际主义是马克思主义政党的伟大口号，这个口号符合自己的整个世界观，并且反映自己的政策。自从马克思和恩格斯“共产党宣言”公布以来，“全世界无产者，联合起来！”这一号召一百多年来一直是工人运动的最重要的口号，工人运动的力量和强盛就在于团结和统一。
    在维护工人阶级和全体劳动人民利益的斗争中，在反对新战争威胁、在反对垄断资本的反人民力量和在反对殖民压迫的斗争中，所有的工人马克思主义政党利益的根本一致，是无产阶级国际主义的巩固基础。国际主义联系的巩固，对社会主义国家的工人政党、对所有资本主义国家的马克思主义政党来说，是历史的必然性，是整个国际工人运动进一步胜利发展的保证。
    现在，帝国主义者通过拼凑军事集团、用奴役性的财政从属体系把较弱的资本主义国家束缚起来、运用像国际垄断组织强大机器这样一些杠杆，企图把所有反动势力纠集成一个统一的反共阵线。在这种情况下，所有马克思主义的、革命的工人阶级政党的思想统一和国际团结，就具有特别意义。各兄弟共产党和苏联共产党都深刻理解到这一点。
    资本主义国家共产党对帝国主义集团的破坏阴谋给予日益坚决的反击，步步揭穿竭力分裂国际工人运动的工人阶级的敌人的现在所进行的诽谤运动。
    对各国共产党为反对帝国主义反动势力的阴谋而进行的这一具有历史意义的斗争来说，苏共中央六月三十日“关于克服个人崇拜及其后果”的决议有重大的意义。法国共产党机关报
  “人道报”正确地认为，这一决议是“对争取和平和社会主义的国际工人运动的活动的一个极其重大的新贡献。”
    苏共中央六月三十日的决议运用马克思列宁主义，明确地阐明了工人运动史上的现阶段。反对苏联和共产主义的诽谤者受到了致命的打击。他们现在像兔子在路上碰到明灯照耀一般不知躲到哪里才好。工人阶级的敌人是无法掩盖自己的惊慌失措的。
    至于谈到资本主义国家的共产党，它们更高地举起光荣的、马克思列宁主义的、无产阶级国际主义旗帜。法国共产党中央委员会热烈拥护苏共中央的决议。意大利共产党总书记陶里亚蒂同志表示“无条件地拥护苏共领导人过去和现在为在苏联、在国际工人运动中彻底肃清对斯大林个人崇拜的后果所做的工作”。最近法国、意大利、比利时和英国的共产党代表团同苏共领导人的会谈，是在诚挚气氛中、本着兄弟党之间的真诚友谊和相互谅解的精神进行的。这些会谈促进各国工人阶级的马克思主义政党的兄弟团结，加强它们之间的联系和合作。
    印度共产党中央委员会在自己的决议中说：苏共中央六月三十日的决议正确地指出劳动人民的敌人的阴谋诡计，着重指出必须忠于马克思列宁主义的科学思想和无产阶级国际主义的事业。
    在争取和平和社会主义的斗争中，国际主义团结的思想掌握了劳动人民群众，就变成现代的伟大历史力量。这就是为什么工人阶级的敌人的阴谋注定了要破产。这就是为什么他们破坏不了无产阶级的国际主义。苏共中央六月三十日决议的最后几句话贯穿着对共产主义力量的深刻的信心，今天这几句话显得特别有力量和具有信心。苏共中央六月三十日决议的最后几句话说：“让资产阶级的思想家去编造共产主义‘危机’、共产党队伍‘混乱’的神话吧。我们听惯了敌人的这类咒语。他们的预言最后总是化成泡影。这些倒霉的预言者出现了，又消失了而共产主义运动，不朽的、生气勃勃的马克思列宁主义思想却不断取得胜利。今后也仍将是这样。我们的敌人的任何恶毒的‘诽谤攻击，都不能终止人类走向共产主义的不可遏制的历史发展进程。”
