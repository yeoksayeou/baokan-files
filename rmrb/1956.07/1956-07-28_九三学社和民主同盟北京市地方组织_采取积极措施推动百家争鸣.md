    Xinhua News Agency, July 26th – The Jiusan Society and the Beijing Municipal Organizations of the China Democratic League are taking active measures to promote the "Hundred Schools of Thought."

    The Jiusan Society has already appointed Yun Zhen and four others to jointly form a special group to carry out the "Hundred Schools of Thought" campaign, and has initially decided to select some relatively important issues in social sciences and natural sciences, such as linguistics, literature, and pedagogy, to organize discussions among members, with the aim of playing a leading role. In the field of pedagogy, a group of experts has been formed by Dong Weichuan and Mao Lirui, professors of the Department of Education at Beijing Normal University, to be responsible for studying specific topics. Jiusan Society branches in various regions are studying or will study the report by Lu Dingyi, Minister of the Propaganda Department of the CPC Central Committee, on the policy of "Letting a Hundred Flowers Bloom and a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend," and are also publicizing the "Hundred Schools of Thought" policy to members through the "Jiusan Society Newsletter."

    The Beijing Municipal Committee of the China Democratic League is surveying the topics that its members are currently researching and will research, as well as the academic works that have been published and will be published, in order to better promote the "Hundred Schools of Thought."

    In recent months, the Jiusan Society, the China Democratic League, the China Association for Promoting Democracy, and the Chinese Peasants and Workers Democratic Party have held symposiums to solicit opinions from their respective members on the "Hundred Schools of Thought" and to understand the problems and difficulties that may be encountered in carrying out the campaign.

    采取积极措施推动百家争鸣
    据新华社26日讯　九三学社和中国民主同盟北京市地方组织正在采取积极措施，推动“百家争鸣”。
    九三学社已经推定恽震等五人联合组成开展“百家争鸣”的专门小组，并且初步决定在社会科学和自然科学中选定语言学、文学和教育学等方面一些比较重要的问题，组织社员讨论，以期起带头作用。教育学方面，已经由北京师范大学教育系教授董渭川、毛礼锐等组成专家小组，负责研究具体的题目。九三学社各地分社正在学习或将要学习中共中央宣传部部长陆定一关于“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的报告，同时通过“九三学社社务简讯”向社员宣传“百家争鸣”的方针。
    民盟北京市委员会正在调查盟员正在研究和将要研究的题目以及发表过的和将要发表的学术著作，以便更好地推动“百家争鸣”。
    九三学社、中国民主同盟、中国民主促进会和中国农工民主党近几个月来纷纷举行座谈会，征求各自成员对“百家争鸣”的意见，了解开展“百家争鸣”可能遇到的问题和困难。
