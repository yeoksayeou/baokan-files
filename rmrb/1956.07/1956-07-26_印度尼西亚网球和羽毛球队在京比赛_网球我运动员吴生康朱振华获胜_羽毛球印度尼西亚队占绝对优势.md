    Indonesian Tennis and Badminton Teams Compete in Beijing
    Our Tennis Players Wu Shengkang and Zhu Zhenhua Win
    Indonesian Badminton Team Holds Absolute Advantage
    (Our Newspaper) News: Young New China tennis players Wu Shengkang and Zhu Zhenhua, in their first international competition yesterday afternoon, defeated Indonesian tennis players Chen Bingshun and Yizha Si·Sumarna (yesterday translated as Yi Zhas·Sunarma) with scores of two to zero and two to one (best-of-three sets), respectively.
    The first men's singles tennis match was between Chen Bingshun and Wu Shengkang. Chen Bingshun was the Indonesian singles runner-up in 1956. He moved nimbly while playing, often taking advantage of Wu Shengkang being at the baseline to use a backhand slice to send a spinning ball to the opponent's net, scoring because the opponent couldn't save it in time. Wu Shengkang, who came from a worker's background, was the 1956 Chinese men's singles tennis champion. Yesterday, his fighting spirit was strong, and he played steadily, saving many dangerous balls, and actively attacked whenever he had the opportunity. His forehand shots, combined with lobs, often forced his opponent to run back and forth on the court. Therefore, he maintained the initiative throughout the match, winning both sets six to zero.
    The second match was between Yizha Si·Sumarna and Zhu Zhenhua. Sumarna played very skillfully. His serves with spin made it difficult for the opponent to receive, and he seized the advantageous position of getting to the net whenever he had the chance, intercepting the incoming ball. When the opponent was forced to retreat beyond the baseline to defend, he would slice a ball that barely cleared the net. Zhu Zhenhua often lost points because he couldn't cope. Although Sumarna lost the first set to Zhu Zhenhua with a score of five to seven, he then won a set back with six to four. In the final set, because Sumarna's stamina was not as good as Zhu Zhenhua's, and Zhu Zhenhua changed his tactics, using lobs to prevent the opponent from reaching the net, creating good opportunities for himself to attack, he finally won with a score of six to one.
    (Our Newspaper) News: The world-class Indonesian badminton team held its first exhibition match with Chinese badminton players at the Beijing Gymnasium last night. In the five matches, except for one men's singles match where our athlete Huang Shiming won, the other four matches were lost to the Indonesian badminton team.
    Li Baozan's first match with our athlete Chen Fushou was quite intense. At the beginning, the two sides fought for the right to serve seven times, and later they drew at one all and two all. Li Baozan is physically strong, quick in his reactions, light on his feet, and has comprehensive attack and defense skills. He was the third-place winner in the All-Indonesia badminton men's singles in 1955. Chen Fushou's attack was not strong yesterday, and he lost to Li Baozan by two to zero.
    In the second women's singles match, Wang Fengniang, one of the 1955 Indonesian badminton women's doubles champions, also defeated Zheng Cuiqiong by two to zero. Wang Fengniang played several very beautiful backhand baseline low balls yesterday, constantly winning applause from the audience.
    Zhang Xiangdao and Huang Shiming are both young athletes with similar technical levels. Our athlete Huang Shiming fiercely smashed the first game and won. In the second game, Zhang Xiangdao once took the lead with eleven to five, but Huang Shiming played steadily, catching up to fourteen all, and finally winning three points in a row, turning defeat into victory.
    In the mixed doubles match between our athletes Chen Fushou and Lin Xiaoyu against Wu Xiangmu and Wei Yingniang, Chen Fushou and Lin Xiaoyu did not cooperate well enough. The opponents took advantage of their confused lineup and actively attacked, winning by two to zero.
    Oli versus Wang Wenjiao was the most intense match yesterday. Oli was the runner-up in the 1955 Indonesian badminton men's singles, and Wang Wenjiao was the 1956 Chinese badminton men's singles champion. Oli played very steadily yesterday, and also used many excellent balls with elusive feints. Wang Wenjiao's skills have improved rapidly in recent years. He has a powerful smash and is good at drop shots at the net, but his match experience is not as rich as Oli's. He was a little nervous yesterday, and finally lost to Oli by two to zero.
    Premier Zhou Enlai watched yesterday's badminton exhibition match, and after the exhibition match, he went to the court to shake hands with the Indonesian badminton team members and the Indonesian tennis team members who were watching the exhibition, and took pictures together. A simple but grand welcome ceremony was held before the exhibition match. Ma John, Vice Chairman of the All-China Sports Federation, and Yuslan Mannan of the Indonesian badminton team spoke successively. (Attached picture)

    印度尼西亚网球和羽毛球队在京比赛
    网球我运动员吴生康朱振华获胜
    羽毛球印度尼西亚队占绝对优势
    本报讯　年轻的新中国网球运动员吴生康、朱振华，昨天下午在第一次参加国际比赛时，分别以二比零、二比一（三盘两胜制）击败了印度尼西亚网球选手陈炳顺和伊渣斯·苏马尔纳（昨译成依扎斯·苏纳尔玛）。
    第一场男子网球单打是陈炳顺对吴生康。陈炳顺是1956年印度尼西亚单打亚军。他打球时步法矫捷，他常趁吴生康在端线时，用反手削旋转球至对方网口，使对方抢救不及而得分。工人出身的吴生康，是1956年我国网球男子单打冠军。昨天他的战斗意志很强，打得也稳，救出许多险球，一有机会就积极进攻。他的正手抽球配合以高吊球，常常迫使对方在场上来回奔跑。因此在比赛中一直掌握主动，两盘都以六比零取胜。
    第二场伊渣斯·苏马尔纳对朱振华。苏马尔纳的球打得很老练。他发的旋转球使对方很难接过，有机会就争得了上网的有利地位，拦截来球。当对方被迫退到端线以外防守，他又削出一个刚刚过网的球。朱振华常因应接不暇而失分。苏马尔纳第一盘虽以五比七输给了朱振华，接着又以六比四扳回一盘。最后一盘因为苏马尔纳体力不如朱振华，同时朱振华改变了战术，打高吊球，使对方上网不成，给自己造成进攻的好机会，终以六比一得胜。
    本报讯　具有世界水平的印度尼西亚羽毛球队同我国羽毛球运动员昨晚在北京体育馆举行了首次表演比赛。在五场比赛中，除一场男子单打我国运动员黄世明获胜外，其余四场都败给印度尼西亚羽毛球队。
    李宝灿同我国运动员陈福寿第一场比赛打得相当紧张，一开始双方就争夺了七次发球权，后来又打到一平和二平。李宝灿的身体健壮，反应快，步法轻松，攻守全备，他是1955年全印度尼西亚羽毛球男子单打第三名。陈福寿昨天的进攻不强，以二比零败于李宝灿。
    第二场女子单打，1955年印度尼西亚羽毛球女子双打冠军之一的王凤娘也以二比零战胜郑翠琼。王凤娘昨天打出几个非常漂亮的反拍底线低球，不断博得观众喝采。
    张祥道和黄世明都是年轻的运动员，技术水平相差不多。我国运动员黄世明昨天首先猛烈地扣杀胜了第一局。第二局张祥道曾经以十一比五，一度占先，但黄世明稳扎稳打，追到十四平，最后连胜了三球，转败为胜。
    在我国运动员陈福寿、林小玉对吴祥木、魏英娘的混合双打中，陈福寿和林小玉合作得不够好，对方趁他们的阵容混乱积极进攻，以二比零取胜。
    奥利对王文教是昨天比赛最激烈的一场。奥利是1955年印度尼西亚羽毛球男子单打亚军，王文教是1956年我国羽毛球男子单打冠军。奥利昨天打得非常稳，同时还用神出鬼没的假动作打出许多出色的球。王文教几年来技术提高很快，扣球有力，并善于吊网前球，但是比赛经验不如奥利丰富，昨天临场有些紧张，最后还是以二比零输给奥利。
    周恩来总理观看了昨天的羽毛球表演赛，并且在表演赛结束以后，到球场上同印度尼西亚羽毛球队队员和在场观看表演赛的印度尼西亚网球队队员一一握手，并且在一起照了像。表演赛以前举行了简单而隆重的欢迎仪式。中华全国体育总会副主席马约翰和印度尼西亚羽毛球队尤斯蓝·曼南先后讲了话。（附图片）
