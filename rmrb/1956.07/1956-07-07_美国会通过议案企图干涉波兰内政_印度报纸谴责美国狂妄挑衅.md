Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, July 6th: Some Indian newspapers have condemned the U.S. Senate for passing a provocative resolution of gloating over the recent unrest in Poznan, Poland.

The "Hindustan Standard" published an editorial on July 5th, stating: "We believe that we have never heard the U.S. Senate say a good word about the courage of Algerian nationalists or Cypriots resisting tyranny." The newspaper pointed out that the U.S. Senate "did not say any words of encouragement to Indian patriots during their struggle for freedom." It also said that, on the other hand, "in the United States, the valiant fighters for equal rights for Black people are subjected to strict scrutiny by the House Un-American Activities Committee."

While exposing the hypocrisy of the U.S. Senators' so-called "sympathy," the "Hindustan Standard" reminded them: "Poznan is by no means within the sphere of activity of the United States." This arrogant attitude of interfering in others' affairs should be condemned.

The "Free Press Journal" of July 2nd ridiculed the "grief" and "shock" felt by American and British rulers over the incident. It said: "The British and American governments do not feel grief or shock when ten times as many people are shot dead in Algeria every day. They have never reminded the French government with grief of its civilized responsibility to grant political freedom to the people of North Africa. When British soldiers shoot children and women in Cyprus, the White House continues with lunch and dinner as usual, without feeling any shock."

The newspaper said: "Governments like those of Britain or the United States do not have deep concern for the happiness and suffering of the people of other countries," but are "very keen to put the governments of other countries—especially those they dislike for some reason—into great difficulty."

The Bengali daily "Freedom" of July 4th said: The U.S. imperialists "have proved by their welcome of the Poznan incident that they are carrying out these subversive activities in Poland only because they cannot 'liberate' the people of the democratic countries."

Xinhua News Agency, Washington, July 6th: The U.S. House of Representatives unanimously passed a proposal by House Democratic Leader McCormack on July 3rd, which requested the U.S. President to raise the issue of the situation in Poland with the United Nations and to "halt" the Polish government's "retaliation" against the instigators of the Poznan incident "through all possible diplomatic actions." This proposal, which openly attempts to interfere in Poland's internal affairs, also expressed the hope to restore the so-called "free" system in Poland, arguing that failure to do so "would endanger the security of the United States."

The Senate also passed a proposal on July 2nd, expressing "deep admiration" for the instigators of the Poznan incident.

### 美国会通过议案企图干涉波兰内政  印度报纸谴责美国狂妄挑衅

    美国会通过议案企图干涉波兰内政
    印度报纸谴责美国狂妄挑衅
    新华社新德里6日电　一些印度报纸谴责美国参议院就最近在波兰的波兹南发生的骚动通过幸灾乐祸的挑衅性决议。
    七月五日的“印度斯坦旗报”发表社论说：“我们认为，我们从来没有听到美国参议院对阿尔及利亚民族主义者或者对塞浦路斯人抵抗暴政的勇气说过一句好话。”这家报纸指出，美国参议院“在印度爱国者争取自由的斗争期间，也没有对他们说过任何鼓励的话”。它还说，另一方面，“在美国，争取黑人平等权利的英勇战士们却受到参议院非美活动调查委员会的严格盘查”。
    “印度斯坦旗报”在揭发美国参议员的所谓“同情”的虚伪性的时候提醒他们说：“波兹南绝不是美国的活动范围。”这种干涉别人的狂妄态度是应当受到谴责的。
    七月二日的“自由新闻”讥讽美国和英国统治者对这次事件感到“悲痛”和“震惊”。它说：“英国和美国政府对于在阿尔及利亚每天有十倍的人被枪杀并不感到悲痛和震惊。它们从来没有以悲痛的心情提醒法国政府履行文明的责任，给予北非人民以政治自由。当英国士兵在塞浦路斯枪杀儿童和妇女的时候，白宫照旧在用午餐和晚餐，而没有感到什么震惊。”
    这家报纸说：“像英国或美国的这些政府，对于其他国家人民的幸福和痛苦并没有深切的关怀”，而是“很热中于使其他国家的政府——特别是使那些它们为了某种原因而不喜欢的政府——陷于极大的困境。”
    七月四日的孟加拉文日报“自由报”说：美帝国主义者“已经通过他们欢迎波兹南事件这件事证明他们在波兰进行这些颠复活动只是因为他们不能‘解放’各民主国家的人民。”
    新华社6日讯　华盛顿消息：美国众议院在七月三日一致通过了众议院民主党领袖麦考马克的一项提案，提案要求美国总统向联合国提出波兰局势问题，并且“通过一切可能的外交行动”，来“制止”波兰政府对波兹南事件煽动者的“报复”。这个公开企图干涉波兰内政的提案还表示希望在波兰恢复所谓“自由”制度，提案还认为不这样“就会危及美国的安全”。
    参议院在七月二日也通过一项提案，对波兹南事件的煽动者表示“深深的赞佩”。
