    Li Zicheng's Death Location Has Been Ascertained
    The death location of peasant revolutionary leader Li Zicheng has been ascertained as Jiugong Mountain in Tongshan County, Hubei Province. This is confirmed in the article "Research on the Death Location of the Great Shun Army Leader Li Zicheng," published in the latest issue of "History Teaching."
    There have been several different records regarding the location of Li Zicheng's death, among which the more reliable records all believe that he died at Jiugong Mountain in Hubei. However, there are two different views regarding which county Jiugong Mountain belongs to. Some say it is Tongcheng County, and some say it is Tongshan County. This time, the "History Teaching" editorial department, based on the records of two relatively original materials—the "Tongshan County Chronicle" of the fourth year of the Kangxi reign and the "Cheng Family Genealogy" of Tongshan County—and after analyzing Li Zicheng's marching route, affirmed that Jiugong Mountain belongs to Tongshan County in Hubei, not Tongcheng County. The verification by the "History Teaching" editorial department, after the research of the History Department of Hubei Normal College, the History Department of Wuhan University, and Mr. Jin Yufu, added a lot of strong evidence. All the verifications and opinions were published in the sixth issue of "Historical Research" in 1956. Mr. Guo Moruo also believes that this verification is indeed well-founded and can be trusted.

### 李自成的被害地点已经考定

    李自成的被害地点已经考定
    农民革命领袖李自成的被害地点，已经考定为湖北省通山县九宫山，这是最近一期“历史教学”上所发表的“关于大顺军领袖李自成被害地点考证”一文所证实的。
    关于李自成的殉难地点，有过好几种不同的记载，其中比较可靠的记载都认为殉难于湖北九宫山。但是对于九宫山属于那一县管辖却有二种不同的说法。有的说是通城县，有的说是通山县。这次“历史教学”编辑部根据两种比较原始的资料——康熙四年的“通山县志”和通山县“程氏宗谱”的记载，并分析了李自成的进军路线，肯定九宫山属于湖北通山县，不是通城县。“历史教学”编辑部的考证，经过湖北师专历史学系、武汉大学历史学系和金毓黻先生的研究，他们又补充了不少有力的证据。所有的考证和意见都在1956年第六期“历史研究”上发表了。郭沫若先生也认为这一考证是确实有据的，是可以信赖的。
