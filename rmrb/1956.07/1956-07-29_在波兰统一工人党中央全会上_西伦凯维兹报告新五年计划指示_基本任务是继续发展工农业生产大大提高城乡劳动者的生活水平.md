Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, July 28th: Warsaw newspapers published the report by Polish Council of Ministers Chairman Cyrankiewicz at the Seventh Plenary Session of the Polish United Workers' Party Central Committee, "On Directives for the 1956-1960 Five-Year Plan."

In his report, Cyrankiewicz first described the summary of the Six-Year Plan which ended last year. He said that despite the imbalances that had been created and not overcome, the Six-Year Plan was a historically significant and great achievement. It fundamentally changed Poland, established a strong industrial base, and transformed Poland into a country with enormous industrial potential and unlimited development possibilities.

Cyrankiewicz then said that our policy of rapidly developing socialist industrialization was correct. The substantial increase in industrial production is one of the basic conditions for improving living standards.

Industrialization is a condition for developing other sectors of the national economy, and a necessary condition for consolidating national independence and strengthening national defense capabilities. However, we were unable to avoid making mistakes in formulating and implementing the plan.

Cyrankiewicz pointed out many shortcomings in capital construction and the insufficient development of agricultural production. All of this had an impact on the material and working conditions of the broad masses. Cyrankiewicz continued that improving industrial and agricultural production is the basic economic and political task of the Five-Year Plan, because only in this way can the living standards of the broad masses of urban and rural workers be greatly improved. We intend to increase the real wages of workers and the income of farmers by an average of 30% in 1960. For this purpose, we should achieve the necessary improvement in industrial and agricultural production and labor productivity, and reduce production costs.

Cyrankiewicz emphasized that during the Five-Year Plan period, industrial production should increase by 53% to 57%, and agricultural production should increase by 25%. This will lay the foundation for an increase in national income of about 50%. Investment will reach 318 billion zlotys, which is 45% more than the investment from 1951 to 1955, calculated at comparable prices.

Cyrankiewicz also said that the Party will study the plan to implement a seven-hour workday in some economic sectors in the final years of the Five-Year Plan, based on improving labor productivity and improving the level of production organization.

Cyrankiewicz pointed out that the tasks of the Five-Year Plan in agriculture have already been specified in detail in the resolutions of the Fifth Plenary Session of the Party. The results of the implementation of the 1955-1956 national economic plan make us more firmly believe that the program adopted by the Fifth Plenary Session is correct and realistic. The new Five-Year Plan is creating economic and technical conditions for improving agricultural production and increasing the income of working farmers. The new Five-Year Plan also stipulates the creation of favorable conditions for further voluntary integration of farmers into agricultural production cooperatives.

Cyrankiewicz pointed out that these are the draft Five-Year Plan directives that we are submitting to the plenary session as the basis for the development of our economy from 1956 to 1960. The starting point of this plan is the need to greatly improve the living standards of urban and rural workers. The remaining indicators of the plan are adapted to this basic policy. Eliminating or at least reducing imbalances is the second basic policy of the plan, which restricts the further development of our economy and affects the living conditions and living standards of the working people.

Cyrankiewicz concluded by saying that our plenary session clearly shows the working class and all the people that the leading organs and the entire Party are united in implementing the general line, that they are ready to act, to implement the Leninist norms of Party life, and to give full play to the enthusiasm and creativity of the working masses in order to improve material welfare, strengthen strength, and develop our country, and strengthen fraternal ties with the Soviet Union and other socialist countries.

    在波兰统一工人党中央全会上
    西伦凯维兹报告新五年计划指示
    基本任务是继续发展工农业生产大大提高城乡劳动者的生活水平
    据新华社华沙28日电　华沙报纸刊载了波兰部长 会议主席西伦凯维兹在波兰统一工人党中央委员会第七次全体会议上所作的“关于1956—1960年五年计划指示”的报告。
    西伦凯维兹在报告中首先叙述了去年结束的六年计划的总结。他说，尽管有已经造成的、没有克服的不均衡现象，但是六年计划是有历史意义的巨大成就。它使波兰发生了根本的改变，建立了强大的工业基地，把波兰变成了一个拥有巨大工业潜力和无限发展可能的国家。
    西伦凯维兹接着说，我们迅速开展社会主义工业化的方针是正确的。工业生产的大大增加是生活水平提高的基本条件之一。
    工业化是发展国民经济其他部门的条件，是巩固国家独立和加强国防能力的必要条件。然而，我们在制定计划方面和执行计划过程中没有能够避免犯错误。
    西伦凯维兹指出了在基本建设方面的许多缺点和农业生产的发展不够。这一切都对广大群众的物质生活条件和劳动条件产生了影响。西伦凯维兹接着说，提高工农业生产是五年计划的基本的经济和政治任务，因为这样才能够大大提高城乡广大劳动群众的生活水平。我们打算在1960年把工人的实际工资和农民的收入平均增加30％。为了这个目的，我们应该使工农业生产和劳动生产率获得必要的提高并且降低生产成本。
    西伦凯维兹着重指出，在五年计划期间内，工业生产应该提高53％到57％，农业生产提高25％。这将为国民收入约增加50％左右奠定基础。投资将达到三千一百八十亿兹罗提，按照比较价格计算，这比1951年到1955年的投资多45％。
    西伦凯维兹还说，党将研究在提高劳动生产率和提高生产组织水平的基础上，在五年计划的最后几年中提出在某些经济部门实行七小时工作日的计划。
    西伦凯维兹指出，五年计划农业方面的任务已经由党在第五次全体会议的决议中详细规定出来了。1955—1956年度国民经济计划执行结果使我们更加坚定地相信第五次全体会议所通过的纲要是正确的、现实的。新五年计划正为提高农业生产、增加劳动农民的收入创造经济和技术条件。新五年计划还规定要为进一步把农民自愿联合到农业生产合作社中创造有利条件。
    西伦凯维兹指出，以上就是我们向全体会议提出作为1956—1960年发展我们经济的基础的五年计划指示草案。这个计划的出发点是必须大大提高城乡劳动者的生活水平。计划的其余指标都是适应于这一基本方针的。消除或者至少减少不平衡现象是计划的第二个基本方针，这种不平衡现象束缚着我们经济的进一步发展，影响着劳动人民的生活条件和生活水平。
    西伦凯维兹最后说，我们的全体会议向工人阶级和全体人民清楚地表明，领导机构和全党在实现总路线方面是一致的，它们准备行动，贯彻党内生活的列宁主义准则，为提高物质福利、加强力量和发展我们的国家以及加强同苏联和社会主义各国的兄弟联系而发挥劳动群众的积极性和创造能力。
