    Banana Fiber Woven into Linen
    Linen entirely woven from banana fiber has recently been successfully trial-produced by the Chengguan District Handicraft Production Cooperative in Longchang County, Sichuan Province. The five-zhang-long linen woven by this cooperative from this fiber has been tested and proven suitable for manufacturing mosquito nets, sandals, and other items. The cooperative is now preparing to continue production in batches.
    The technique of making linen from banana fiber was researched and developed by Wang Jianlan, a teacher at the Paimu Town Primary School in Neijiang County. After he proposed using banana fiber to make hemp rope in May of last year, the County People's Committee allocated funds and assistants to support his continued research. However, because the county lacked complete hemp-making tools, banana fiber could not be made into linen. On June 18th of this year, Wang Jianlan came to Longchang, the center of the hemp weaving industry in Sichuan Province. With the assistance of local handicraft weavers, he finally succeeded in making linen from banana fiber.
    Banana plants are widely cultivated in rural areas of Sichuan Province. Because the fiber of the banana stalk skin is long and has strong tensile strength, and the linen produced is soft and has a bright color, it has a wide range of uses and can greatly help to overcome the difficulty of insufficient linen materials.

    芭蕉纤维织成麻布
    完全用芭蕉纤维织成的麻布，最近由四川省隆昌县城关区手工业生产合作社试制成功。这个合作社用这种纤维织成的五丈长的麻布，经过试验证明，可以制造蚊帐、凉鞋等用品。现在这个合作社正准备继续成批生产。
    芭蕉纤维制麻是内江县椑木镇小学校教员王剑岚研究成功的。去年五月，他提出用芭蕉纤维制造麻绳的建议以后，县人民委员会就拨给经费和助手，支持他继续研究。但是因为这个县的制麻工具不全，蕉麻无法制成麻布。今年六月十八日，王剑岚来到了四川省麻织业的中心——隆昌。他在当地手工业织布工人的协助下，终于利用芭蕉纤维制成了麻布。
    四川省的农村普遍种植芭蕉。由于芭蕉杆皮的纤维长、拉力强，制出的麻布很柔软，色泽光亮，因此用途很广，对克服麻料不足的困难有很大作用。
