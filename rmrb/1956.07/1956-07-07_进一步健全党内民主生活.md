    Further Improve Party Inner-Party Democratic Life

    The New China Daily published an editorial on June 28, summarizing the experience of various local party congresses in promoting democracy and carrying out criticism, and calling for the correct implementation of the democratic spirit of the congress into grassroots organizations and daily work.

    The editorial pointed out that in order for the Party Congress to be successful, the leaders of the congress must not only boldly promote democracy, but also boldly lead, enlighten, and guide representatives to grasp the main issues for discussion, and guide criticism in the right direction. Not daring to boldly promote democracy and not daring to boldly lead are both detrimental to the normal democratic life within the Party.

    When discussing how to correctly carry out criticism and self-criticism, the editorial stated that not only should the right of every representative to criticize others be guaranteed, but also the right of the criticized to defend themselves should be guaranteed. A distinction should be made between adhering to correct opinions and being unwilling to accept criticism and suppressing democracy.

    After the convening of party congresses in various places, it was discovered that there were two abnormal sentiments among party members: one was that some leading cadres were preoccupied with personal gains and losses after being criticized and did not dare to work boldly and responsibly. The other was that some grassroots workers unilaterally believed that promoting democracy meant that they did not have to implement the instructions of the higher party committee, and individual branches even made resolutions that contradicted the instructions of the county party committee. The editorial analyzed and criticized these two biases, pointing out the importance of further improving the Party's inner-party democratic life.

专栏：地方报纸评论摘要

    进一步健全党内民主生活
    新华日报在六月二十八日发表的一篇社论中，总结了各地党代表大会发扬民主开展批评的经验，号召把大会的民主精神正确地贯彻到基层组织和日常工作中去。
    社论指出：要使党代表大会开得好，大会的领导者固然要放手发扬民主，同时也要大胆进行领导，启发和诱导代表抓住主要问题展开讨论，把批评引向正确的方向。不敢放手发扬民主和不敢大胆领导，对于党内正常的民主生活都是不利的。
    在谈到如何正确地开展批评和自我批评的时候，社论说不但要保障每个代表有批评别人的权利，而且要保障被批评者有申辩的权利。应该把坚持正确的意见同不虚心接受批评、压制民主这两回事区别开来。
    在各地召开党代表大会以后，发现党员中有两种不正常的情绪：一种是，有些领导干部在受到批评后患得患失，不敢大胆负责地工作。另一种是，有的基层工作人员片面地认为发扬民主就可以不执行上级党委的指示，个别支部甚至作出了同县委指示相抵触的决议。社论对这两种偏向进行了分析和批判，指出了进一步健全党内民主生活的重要性。
