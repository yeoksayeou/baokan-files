    We Must Urge the Resolution of Old Problems
    Zeng Dao

    Since March, the Xi'an Daily has paid attention to publicizing the streamlining of meetings in factories and enterprises. This publicity has many benefits for improving the work style and methods of enterprise leaders, and for promoting the advanced producer movement.

    The current situation of excessive meetings in factories and enterprises has already produced very bad effects. However, many enterprise cadres regard holding meetings as a "panacea" for solving all problems, believing that "excessive meetings are unavoidable." In response to this situation, the Xi'an Daily published readers' letters such as "'Ruthless Milky Way' in State-owned Cotton Factory No. 1" and "Overtime Work and Meetings Take Up Rest and Recreation Time," using specific facts to illustrate that this affects workers' health, deprives workers of their leisure time, and thus affects production. At the same time, in editorials such as "Thoroughly Change Leadership Style" and "Streamline Meetings in Enterprises," it pointed out the various disadvantages of excessive meetings and repeatedly criticized the erroneous idea that "problems cannot be solved without meetings."

    The Xi'an Daily did not stop at simple exposure and general ideological criticism. It also reported on the new atmosphere that emerged in some factories after streamlining meetings and introduced some good practices. These reports used vivid and concrete examples to illustrate that as long as leaders are determined and take concrete measures, the situation of excessive meetings can be completely changed. For example, in the past, various departments of the Dahua Textile Factory competed for time to hold meetings, depriving the masses of workers and staff of guaranteed leisure time. Although the factory leaders made several arrangements, the problem was never solved because they were not determined. Later, after criticism was raised at the party representative meeting, the Party Committee formulated a factory-wide meeting system and arrangements for workers' and staff's leisure time based on the opinions of the masses. Soon after implementation, a new order of life appeared in the factory, leaders began to break out of the circle of meetings, and workers' and staff's recreational activities and cultural learning also began to flourish.

    To solve the problem of excessive meetings in factories and enterprises, the efforts of factories and enterprises alone are not enough; the higher-level leading organs also bear great responsibility. The Xi'an Daily paid attention to this point. It published a short article, "Don't Let Cadres Live in Meetings," pointing out that leading organs should take the lead in reducing meetings, go deep into reality, and not ask subordinates to go deep into reality on the one hand, while keeping them on top on the other. Then the newspaper published the news that the "(Northwest) Engineering Management Bureau Streamlined Meeting Reports and Official Documents." The newspaper also published an editorial for this purpose, further pointing out the importance of streamlining meetings by higher-level leading organs.

    In the process of streamlining meetings, some cadres engaged in Party and mass work in some enterprises said that after the meetings were streamlined, they had nothing to do; some units even demanded the cancellation of the monthly political education time for workers and staff. In order to correct this deviation, the Xi'an Daily published the article "Strengthen Political Work Better After Streamlining Meetings." It pointed out that streamlining meetings does not mean that meetings that should be held are not held, nor does it mean that political and ideological work in factories and enterprises can be weakened, but to strengthen the Party's political and ideological work. After streamlining meetings, it is not that there is nothing to do, but that there are more things to do.

    Excessive meetings in factories and enterprises is an old problem. Precisely because this is the case, the newspaper needs to carry out repeated and powerful publicity to promote its resolution. However, some newspapers have not paid attention to this issue. Some newspapers have only exposed the phenomenon of excessive meetings, but have not presented the facts that the leadership style has truly improved after streamlining meetings, the leisure time of workers and staff has been guaranteed, and the quality of the meetings themselves has also been improved, in order to powerfully illustrate the significance and role of carrying out this struggle. For these newspapers, it is necessary to pay attention to strengthening publicity in this area.

    一定要促使老问题得到解决
    曾岛
    从三月份以来，西安日报注意了关于工厂企业中精简会议的宣传。这个宣传对于改进企业领导者的工作作风和工作方法，对于开展先进生产者运动，都有许多好处。
    目前工厂企业中会议过多的情况，已经产生了很坏的影响。但是不少企业干部却把开会当做解决一切问题的“万灵药”，认为“会议过多是不可避免的”。针对这种情况，西安日报发表了‘无情的天河’在国棉一厂”、“加班加点和会议占去了休息和娱乐时间”等读者来信，用具体事实说明了：影响了工人的身体健康，剥夺了工人的业余活动时间，因而也就影响了生产。同时，在“彻底转变领导作风”、“精简企业中的会议”等社论中，它又指出了会议过多的种种坏处，反复地批判了“不开会就不能解决问题”等等错误想法。
    西安日报没有停留在单纯的揭露和一般的思想批判，它还报道了一些工厂精简会议后出现的新气象，介绍了一些好的作法。这些报道以生动具体的事例说明，只要领导上下定决心，并采取具体措施，会议过多的情况是完全可以改变的。例如过去大华纺织厂各部门互相争时间开会，使职工群众的业余活动时间失去了保证。这个工厂的领导人员虽然作过多次安排，但是因为没有下定决心，问题始终没有解决。后来经过党员代表大会提出了批评，党委会就根据群众的意见拟定了全厂会议制度和职工业余活动时间安排办法。实行不久，工厂中便出现新的生活秩序，领导人员开始跳出会议的圈子，职工的文娱活动和文化学习也开始活跃起来了。
    要解决工厂企业会议过多的问题，光是靠工厂企业内部的努力还是不够的，上级领导机关也负有很大的责任。西安日报注意到了这一点。它发表了一篇短文“别叫干部生活在会议里吧”，指出领导机关要带头减少会议，深入实际，不要一面叫下级深入实际，一面又拉他们留在上面。接着报纸又发表了“（西北）工程管理总局精简会议报表和公文”的消息。报纸还为此发表社论，进一步指出了上级领导机关精简会议的重要意义。
    在精简会议的过程中，有些企业中做党、群工作的干部说，会议精简了，自己没事可做了；有的单位还要求取消每月一次的职工政治教育时间。西安日报为了纠正这种偏向，发表了“精简会议后要更好地加强政治工作”的文章。它指出来，精简会议不是说该开的会议都不开了，也不是说可以削弱工厂企业的政治思想工作，而是为了加强党的政治思想工作。精简会议后不是无事可做，而是要做的事更多了。
    工厂企业中会议过多是个老问题。正因为是这样，报纸就需要进行反复的有力的宣传，促使它得到解决。但是，有些报纸对这个问题还没有予以重视。有些报纸又只是揭发了会议过多的现象，而没有拿出精简会议后领导作风真正得到改善、职工业余活动时间有了保证、会议本身的质量也有了提高的事实，来有力地说明进行这个斗争的意义和作用。对这些报纸来说，注意加强这方面的宣传，是有必要的。
