From Xining to Lhasa
He Siyuan

On March 16th of this year, I had the honor of joining the Central Delegation to Lhasa to celebrate the establishment of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region. I spent more than two months on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, visiting Lhasa, Xigaze, Gyantse, Yadong, and Chunpi and Renqinggang on the border. This trip gave me a deeper understanding of Tibet: China cannot be called great without the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau; the Tibetan people would find it difficult to develop without the support of their brotherly ethnic groups in the motherland.

There are two roads from Beijing to Lhasa (not counting the recently successfully test-flown Beijing-Lhasa air route and the route via Xinjiang to northern Tibet). One is via Sichuan, taking the Sichuan-Tibet Highway to Lhasa, which is about 4,300 kilometers long; the other is via Qinghai, taking the Qinghai-Tibet Highway to Lhasa, which is about 4,000 kilometers long. We went via the Qinghai-Tibet Highway.

Xining, the starting point of the Qinghai-Tibet Highway, is 2,295 meters above sea level, 800 meters higher than the summit of Mount Tai in Shandong. However, for the Qinghai-Tibet Highway's altitudes, it is only the "starting point." Fifty kilometers out of Xining is Riyue Mountain, which is 3,500 meters above sea level. Legend has it that Princess Wencheng of the Tang Dynasty passed this mountain on her way to marry in Tibet. She felt that the sun and moon here were different from those in Chang'an, which aroused her homesickness. Emperor Taizong of Tang specially cast golden sun and golden moon discs and sent them here to relieve Princess Wencheng's sorrow. And this mountain got its name from this. In fact, Riyue Mountain, although high, is only the starting point of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. On the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, there are 180 mountains with a height of 6,000 meters, 50 peaks above 7,000 meters, and Mount Everest is nearly 9,000 meters high. In the past, some people thought that the Pamir Plateau was the "Roof of the World," but in terms of the area and height of the highlands, and in terms of the number and altitude of the peaks, the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau is truly the Roof of the World. The highest eastern part of the Pamir Plateau has an area of only tens of thousands of square kilometers and an average altitude of only 3,700 to 4,200 meters, and its main peak, Stalin Peak, is only 7,495 meters; while the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau has an area of 2.3 million square kilometers, an average altitude of 4,000 to 5,000 meters, and the height of its main peak, Mount Everest, is 8,892 meters.

The Qinghai-Tibet Plateau is not all barren. In the 480-kilometer journey from Chahanwusu to Golmud on the southern edge of the Qaidam Basin, and even further to Nachitai, except for about 150 kilometers of gravel Gobi where no traces of human habitation can be seen, most of the area is a semi-pastoral and semi-agricultural area. Near Golmud, there are 400,000 mu of arable land. In Chahanwusu, Nuomuhong, Xiangride, Golmud and other places, I also saw state-owned farms, youth collective farms, and agricultural producers' cooperatives. A farm in Golmud has more than 4,000 people, which is huge in scale. On this vast plateau, I smelled the atmosphere of socialism and saw the blossoming of socialist flowers, which made me very excited. In Chahanwusu, I met 500 young volunteers who had just come from Henan to reclaim wasteland. They were all in high spirits and healthy, and they would use their hands to open up fertile virgin land and build a happy paradise. It is a pity that there are no forests in this area, and the mountains are bare, which still needs everyone's efforts to plant trees.

We crossed the world-famous Kunlun Mountains near Yuxu Peak. Because we were already traveling on a plateau 4,500 meters above sea level, crossing the Kunlun Mountains from the chaotic stone ditch at 4,500 meters above sea level was like climbing only a few hundred meters high dirt slope. But looking from the car, you can see the towering, snow-covered Kunlun Mountains and the deep valleys and ravines beside the road.

Crossing the Kunlun Mountains, more than 1,000 kilometers away from Xining, there is a stretch of uninhabited land for hundreds of miles. The climate in this area is even more special. The mornings and evenings are like severe winters, and it is cold to minus 10 degrees Celsius, or even 19 degrees Celsius, inside the tent. At noon, the sun shines very brightly, and in the afternoon, the west wind roars, but it is like a hot summer, and the temperature in the car is as high as 45 degrees Celsius, or 115 degrees Fahrenheit. On the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, the climate does not differ much throughout the year, but it varies greatly within a day. I said to my companions: "The car turns east, west, north, and south in the mountains, and people experience spring, summer, autumn, and winter in a single day." They all agreed with my statement. I carried a barometer with me and measured it. The air in this area is thin, only half that of sea level. Even so, we can adapt. I am not only a person who grew up in the plains, but also over 60 years old, and I do not feel bitter walking on the plateau. Young friends who go to the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau to participate in construction do not need to worry, and they have great prospects for development.

Earlier I talked about agricultural production on the plateau, and as for mineral resources, they are particularly abundant. Tibet is a marine area of ​​the Mesozoic and Cenozoic eras, and it is still very young geologically. There are many mineral resources that are not available in the interior of the motherland. Our scientific workers should go to Tibet more to find treasures for the motherland. In the uninhabited area of ​​northern Tibet, although the climate is dry, and there are many cold winds, which is not suitable for the development of agriculture, the grassland is still very good. Yaks, sheep, etc. have adapted to the climate there. If the varieties of pasture and livestock are improved, and more places for shelter from the cold and wind are set up, and machines are used to cut grass to feed livestock, it is still an ideal place to develop animal husbandry there.

The Qinghai-Tibet Plateau is very lovely. On this 2,100-kilometer journey, there is the world's highest river, the Urumu River, and the world's highest hot spring. The hot springs on the plateau are the most interesting, with snow-capped mountains and glaciers on one side and hot springs on the other. The water temperature of the hot spring at an altitude of more than 4,800 meters reaches 86 degrees Fahrenheit. Hot springs and glaciers are neighbors, which is truly a wonder of the world. One day, we stayed at the hot spring station. Everyone saw this beautiful place and was unwilling to lie down and rest. They all ran to the hot spring to wash their hands, faces, and feet. It is a pity that the climate is still relatively cold, and it is impossible to jump into the hot spring and take a good bath. We also passed the world's largest lake - Namtso Lake (also known as Tenggeli Sea), which is more than 4,600 meters above sea level and has an area of ​​2,460 square kilometers. As for the road we took, it is the highest road in the world. There are endless famous mountains and rivers, and countless snow-capped mountains and silver screens in this area. I have been to many countries in the world and have seen many scenic spots and historical sites. In terms of magnificence, this is the most beautiful place I have ever been to.

In the past, some people thought that there might be a shortage of water on the plateau. In fact, the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau is covered with lakes and rivers. These lakes and rivers have become a good source of water on the plateau. This area has the most lakes in the country; therefore, it has also become the source of major Asian rivers, such as the Yangtze River, the Yellow River, the Nujiang River, the Lancang River, the Indus River, and the Ganges River.

In the past, when people talked about Qinghai and Tibet, they inevitably thought that they were poor and barren border areas. This is wrong. If we start from Golmud in the southwest of Qinghai and the southern end of the Qaidam Basin, it is 3,000 kilometers to Beijing and Shanghai, 2,000 kilometers to Yili in Xinjiang, and more than 2,000 kilometers to Yunnan. According to this calculation, the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau is not the border of the motherland. However, due to traffic difficulties, the sparse population in this area, and the national oppression policies of the reactionary governments in the past, these places have not been developed for a long time. Under the guidance of the great national policy of the Chinese Communist Party, the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau has only begun to be built in recent years. In places where few people have been, I saw the red flag of the geological exploration team fluttering; I heard the soldiers of the People's Liberation Army singing "People say Tibet is too barren, I say Tibet has treasures, gold, silver, copper, and iron are everywhere, fertile fields and pastures are long." I was infinitely excited. It is said that the government's planned Qinghai-Tibet Railway can be open to traffic to Golmud in three or five years. The rapid progress of the construction of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau can be expected. (Attached photo)

The hot spring is located at the foot of the Tanggula Mountains at the junction of Qinghai and Tibet. In the past, there was no human habitation here, but now it is a station on the Qinghai-Tibet Highway.

    从西宁到拉萨
    何思源
    今年三月十六日，我荣幸地参加了中央代表团，由北京前往拉萨，祝贺西藏自治区筹备委员会的成立。我在青藏高原两个多月，到了拉萨、日喀则、江孜、亚东和国境界的春丕、仁庆岗等地。此行使我对西藏有了进一步的认识：中国若无青藏高原，不能称为伟大；西藏民族若无祖国各兄弟民族的支援，则难以发展。
    从北京到拉萨有两条路可通（最近试航成功的北京—拉萨航线和经新疆前往藏北不计算在内），一条经四川取道康藏公路到拉萨，共长约四千三百公里；一条经青海取道青藏公路到拉萨，共长约四千公里。我们是从青藏公路去的。
    青藏公路的起点西宁，拔海2，295公尺，比山东泰山绝顶还高八百公尺，可是，对青藏公路的高度说，也只是“起点”。公路出西宁五十公里，就是拔海三千五百公尺的日月山。传说唐代文成公主出嫁西藏经过此山，感觉此地的日月与长安都不一样，引起思乡之感，唐太宗还特为铸造了金日、金月各一轮送到此地，才解除了文成公主的愁怀。而这座大山，就以此得名了。其实，日月山虽高，也还只是青藏高原的起点。在青藏高原，六千公尺高的大山有一百八十座，七千公尺以上的高峰有五十个，而珠穆朗玛峰高度将近九千公尺。过去有人认为帕米尔高原是“世界屋脊”，可是如就高地的面积和高度说，从山峰的数目和海拔说，青藏高原才真正是世界屋脊。帕米尔高原最高的东部，面积不过几万平方公里，海拔平均不过三千七百到四千二百公尺，其主峰斯大林峰也不过七千四百九十五公尺；而青藏高原面积有二百三十万平方公里，海拔平均四千到五千公尺，主峰珠穆朗玛峰的高度是八千八百九十二公尺。
    青藏高原并不都是荒凉的地方，从察汗乌苏到柴达木盆地南缘的噶尔穆的四百八十公里途程中，甚至再前行到纳赤台，其间除了大约有一百五十公里是石子戈壁，看不见人迹外，大部分地区都是半牧半农区。在噶尔穆附近，可耕地就有四十万亩。在察汗乌苏、诺木洪、香日德、噶尔穆等地，我还看见国营农场、青年集体农庄和农业生产合作社。噶尔穆的一个农场就有四千多人，规模巨大。在这辽远的高原上，我闻到社会主义的气息，看到社会主义的花朵盛开，十分兴奋。在察汗乌苏我同刚从河南前去的青年志愿垦荒队五百人相遇，他们个个精神焕发，身体健旺，将用双手打开肥沃的处女地，建设幸福的乐园。可惜这一带看不见树林，到处是童山秃秃，还有待于大家努力造林。
    我们在玉虚峰附近越过世界著名的昆仑山。因为我们本来已行进在拔海四千五百公尺的高原上，从拔海四千五百公尺高的乱石沟越过昆仑山时，就好像只上一个高几百公尺的土坡了。可是从车上望去，可以看到那高耸入云的白雪皑皑的昆仑山岭和公路旁边的深谷纵壑。
    越过昆仑山，离开西宁一千多公里，有一段千里无人烟的地带。这一带的气候更是特殊，早晚好像严寒的冬天，在帐篷内都冷到摄氏零下十度，甚至十九度；中午，日照甚烈，下午，西风怒吼，却又像酷热的夏天，在汽车中的温度，高达摄氏四十五度，即华氏一百一十五度。在青藏高原，一年之间的气候相差不大，一日之间却很悬殊。我对同行者说：“群山中车转东西南北，一日间人过春夏秋冬。”他们都赞同我这个说法。我随身带了一个气压表，量了一量，这一带的空气稀薄，只达海平面的一半。虽然如此，我们也能适应。我不但是生长在平原的人，而且年龄已过六十岁，走在高原上也不以为苦。青年朋友们前往青藏高原参加建设，可以不必顾虑，而且有远大的发展前途。
    前面我已谈到高原上的农业生产，至于矿藏，更是格外丰富。西藏是中生代和新生代的海浸区域，在地质上还很年轻，有很多矿产资源是祖国内地所没有的。我们的科学工作者应该多到西藏去为祖国找出宝贝来。在藏北高原那千里无人烟的地区，虽然气候干，寒风多，不宜发展农业，但草原仍然很好，已有牦牛、绵羊等能适应那里的气候，如果改良牧草和牲畜的品种，并多设避寒避风的场所，利用机器打草来喂养牲畜，在那里发展畜牧业，还是一个理想的所在。
    青藏高原是很可爱的。在这二千一百公里的途中，有世界上最高的河流乌鲁穆苏河，有世界上最高的温泉。高原上的温泉最有意思，一面是雪山冰川，一面是热浆温泉。拔海四千八百多公尺的高地上的温泉，水温达到华氏八十六度。温泉与冰川为邻，真是天下奇观。有一天，我们就住宿在温泉站。大家看见这个美妙的地方，都不愿躺下休息，纷纷跑到温泉去洗手、洗脸、洗脚。可惜气候还是比较冷，不能跳进温泉去痛痛快快洗个澡。我们还经过世界上最高的大湖——纳木湖（又名腾格里海），这湖海拔四千六百多公尺，面积二千四百六十平方公里。至于我们所走的公路，更是世界上最高的公路了。这一带看不完的名山大川，数不尽的雪山银屏，我曾到过世界上不少的国家，也见过不少风景名胜，就雄伟壮丽说，这是我到过的最美丽的地方。
    过去，有人认为高原上可能缺水，其实，青藏高原上遍布湖泊和河流。这些湖泊和河流，成了高原上很好的水源。这一地区湖泊之多，也是全国第一；因而也就成为亚洲各大河流，如长江、黄河、怒江、澜沧江、印度河、恒河等的发源地。
    过去，有人谈到青海、西藏，总不免认为那是贫苦荒凉的边疆地区。这是错误的。我们如果以青海西南部、柴达木盆地南端的噶尔穆算起，从那里到北京、上海都是三千公里，到新疆伊犁是二千公里，到云南也是两千多公里，这样计算，青藏高原不是祖国的边疆。不过由于交通困难，这一地区的人口稀少，以及过去历代反动政府的民族压迫政策，使得这些地方长期不得发展。在中国共产党伟大的民族政策指导之下，这几年来，青藏高原才开始建设。我在人迹罕到的地方，看见了地质勘探队的红旗在招展；我听解放军战士们唱“人说西藏太荒凉，我说西藏有宝藏，金银铜铁遍地是，沃野千里牧草长。”心里无限激动。据说政府计划中的青藏铁路，三几年以后，就可以通车到噶尔穆，青藏高原建设的突飞猛进，可以指日以待。（附图片）
