Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, July 22nd: TASS reports: The Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs delivered a note to the British Embassy in Moscow on July 21 regarding the issue of holding nationwide general elections in Vietnam.

The note stated that the Soviet government had studied the note from the South Vietnamese Minister of Foreign Affairs dated May 22 of this year, which was the South Vietnamese government's response to letters from the two chairmen of the Geneva Conference on Indochina to the governments of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the Republic of Vietnam.

The Soviet government cannot but point out that while the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has consistently expressed its willingness to hold political consultations as quickly as possible to prepare for general elections to unify Vietnam, and has expressed its willingness to send plenipotentiary representatives at any time to meet with qualified representatives of South Vietnam on this issue, the South Vietnamese authorities continue to refuse to cooperate with the authorities of the Democratic Republic in seeking to unify Vietnam, which is stipulated by the Geneva Accords on Vietnam.

The Soviet government also pointed out that the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has repeatedly and publicly stated its willingness not only to provide but also to guarantee all the conditions for genuinely free and democratic general elections in North Vietnam, while the South Vietnamese authorities say that it is practically impossible to hold elections and election campaigns at present. This statement is completely unfounded.

The two chairmen had proposed a certain time to begin consultative meetings aimed at discussing all-Vietnam elections and the timing of such elections. However, the South Vietnamese authorities avoided these proposals in their May 22 note, which is another act of contempt for the Geneva Accords.

The Soviet government pointed out that this attitude of the South Vietnamese authorities violates the Geneva Accords on Vietnam, which are the foundation for restoring and further consolidating peace in Vietnam and world peace. The Soviet government believes that the two chairmen should once again suggest that the South Vietnamese authorities immediately express their views on the timing of the start of consultations and the period for holding general elections.

The Soviet government believes that the full text of the proposal to South Vietnam can be negotiated and decided upon by the representatives of the two chairmen who are continuing talks in London.

### 苏联政府照会英国政府  要求敦促南越同意协商普选

    苏联政府照会英国政府
    要求敦促南越同意协商普选
    新华社22日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联外交部在七月二十一日把一份关于举行越南全国普选问题的照会交给了英国驻莫斯科大使馆。
    照会说，苏联政府研究了南越外交部长今年五月二十二日的照会，这一照会是南越政府对关于印度支那问题的日内瓦会议的两位主席写给越南民主共和国政府和越南共和国政府的信件的答复。
    苏联政府不能不指出，当越南民主共和国政府始终不渝地表示愿意就准备普选以统一越南的问题尽速举行政治协商，并且表示愿意随时派全权代表就这一问题同南越的有资格的代表会谈的时候，南越当局却继续拒绝同民主共和国当局在设法统一越南的问题上进行合作，而统一越南是关于越南问题的日内瓦协定所规定的。
    苏联政府还指，出越南民主共和国一再公开表示愿意不仅是提供，而且是保障在北越举行真正自由民主普选的一切条件，而南越当局却说，现在实际上不可能举行选举和竞选运动。这种说法是完全没有根据的。
    两位主席曾经提出关于规定开始举行旨在讨论全越选举问题的协商会议的一定时间以及关于举行这种选举的时间问题的建议，但是，南越当局在它五月二十二日照会中对这种建议避而不谈，这就是又一次藐视日内瓦协定。
    苏联政府指出，南越当局的这种态度违背关于越南问题的日内瓦协定，而这一协定是恢复和进一步巩固越南和平和世界和平的基础；苏联政府认为，两位主席应该再一次建议南越当局立即表示自己对开始协商的时间和举行普选的时期的意见。
    苏联政府认为，给南越的建议书全文可以由现在在伦敦继续会谈的两位主席的代表协商决定。
