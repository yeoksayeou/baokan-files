    Which Kind of Enamel Basin is Durable and Beautiful?
    Which Kind of Enamel Basin is Unsightly and Not Durable?

    A good quality enamel basin should have a complete iron base, evenly applied enamel powder, a good gloss, and a beautiful design. The enamel basins produced by the Local State-Owned Beijing Enamel Factory and the "Qianjin (Forward)" brand produced by the Local State-Owned Dalian Enamel Factory, the "Huoju (Torch)" brand produced by the Local State-Owned Jilin Enamel Factory, and the "Jinqian (Golden Coin)" brand produced by the Joint State-Private Shanghai Yifeng Enamel Factory, all possess these advantages. Generally, these advantages can prevent the enamel from chipping, and the basins are free from defects such as cracks, unevenness, and pinholes, making them relatively sturdy and durable. These basins have relatively bright and diverse colors, including all-white, powdery green, lake green, and beige. The designs are also relatively novel and beautiful. For example, the Beijing Enamel Factory has designed a ring-shaped pattern with a dove of peace spreading its wings in the center, which is very attractive; another design features potted flowers and narcissus, which is very unique. Some "Torch" brand enamel basins use folk-style window lattice patterns, which have a strong national style. The "Golden Coin" brand enamel basins use more than a dozen bats and their shadows as patterns, with the bats soaring lightly and pleasingly. Other newly created flower, bird, and landscape patterns are also very beautiful. These factories' enamel basins also have some shortcomings, such as small pockmarks and blisters, and it is hoped that they will continue to improve.

    The "Feilun (Flying Wheel)" brand produced by the Joint State-Private Shanghai Weida Enamel Factory, the "Hongdeng (Red Lantern)" brand produced by the Local State-Owned Harbin Enamel Factory, the "Jinji (Golden Rooster)" brand produced by the Joint State-Private Shanghai Jiufeng Enamel Factory, and the "Santao (Three Peaches)" brand produced by the Joint State-Private Tianjin Enamel Factory, are of relatively poor quality. Some products still have spiderweb-shaped bumps, which easily cause the enamel to chip, and the enamel powder contains impurities. The patterns are also not beautiful. For example, the chick on the "Golden Rooster" brand enamel basin has no eyes; the chubby baby on the "Red Lantern" brand enamel basin has a blue and purple face, as if it has been beaten and swollen; the "ox" on the "Flying Wheel" brand enamel basin is neither an ox nor a horse, and the eyebrows and eyes of the girl feeding the ox are unclear, with no hair. Although these brands have recently been improved, the improvements are not significant, and further efforts are needed.

    那一种面盆耐用又好看
    那一种面盆难看又不耐用
    质量较好的搪瓷面盆应该是铁坯完整，琅粉涂得均匀，光泽好，图案美丽的面盆。地方国营北京搪瓷厂的面盆和地方国营大连珐琅厂生产的前进牌、地方国营吉林搪瓷厂生产的火炬牌、公私合营上海益丰搪瓷厂生产的金钱牌等各种面盆，都具备这些优点。具备这些优点一般可以使面盆不崩瓷，没有裂纹、凹凸不平、砂眼等毛病，比较结实耐用。这些面盆的色彩比较鲜艳而多样，有全白、粉绿、湖绿、米色等各种色彩。图案也是比较新颖美丽的。如北京搪瓷厂绘制的一种环形图案，中间是一只展翅飞翔的和平鸽，很好看；另一种绘制着瓶花和水仙盆景的图案，十分别致。火炬牌面盆，有的利用民间窗花形式的图案，很有民族风格。金钱牌面盆则用十多只蝙蝠及其投影作图案，图案中蝙蝠轻盈翱翔，悦目生动。其他新创作的花鸟、风景等图案也很美丽。这些厂生产的面盆也还有一些缺点，如有小麻子、水泡等，希望继续改进。
    公私合营上海伟大搪瓷厂生产的飞轮牌，地方国营哈尔滨搪瓷厂生产的红灯牌，公私合营上海九丰搪瓷厂生产的金鸡牌，公私合营天津搪瓷厂生产的三桃牌等面盆质量比较差。部分产品仍有蜘蛛网形的疙瘩，容易崩瓷，琅粉里有杂质。图案花纹也不美观，如金鸡牌面盆图案上的小鸡没有眼睛；红灯牌面盆图案上的胖娃娃，脸上青一块、紫一块，像被打肿了似的；飞轮牌面盆图案上的“牛”非牛非马，喂牛的姑娘眉眼不清，没头发。这些牌号的产品最近虽有所改进，但是不显著，还有进一步地努力的必要。
