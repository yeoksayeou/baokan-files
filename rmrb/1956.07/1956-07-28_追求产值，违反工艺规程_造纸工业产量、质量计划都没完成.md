Pursuing Output, Violating Operating Procedures
Paper Industry Fails to Meet Production and Quality Plans

    (Our report) The state-owned and joint state-private enterprises under the Paper Industry Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Light Industry have exceeded the state's total output value plan, labor productivity plan, cost reduction plan, and profit delivery plan this year. However, they have failed to meet the production plan and finished product rate plan. According to statistics from January to June, actual production was more than 3,000 tons less than the state plan. The actual finished product rate from January to May was 3% lower than the state plan. In terms of products, the output of major varieties such as newsprint, bond paper, and drawing paper has not been completed. This situation has not improved much until now.
    According to the analysis of the Planning Section of the Paper Industry Administration Bureau, the reason for the failure to complete the production plan is that, in addition to some enterprises' newly installed equipment not being put into production on schedule due to material supply shortages, the main reason is the low finished product rate. Among the twenty-five enterprises under the bureau (the Shanghai Paper Company's twenty-odd factories are counted as one unit), only the Guangzhou, Yingkou, and Taiyuan state-owned paper mills have completed the finished product rate plan. Due to the failure to meet the planned target for the finished product rate, the output was reduced by more than 6,000 tons. What is particularly serious is that the finished product rate of most enterprises is lower than the actual level of last year. Among them, Sichuan 601 Paper Mill is 10% lower than last year, the State-owned Xuanhua Paper Mill (erroneously referred to as locally state-owned in this newspaper's editorial on July 15th) is 7% lower than last year, and Beijing Paper Mill and Shenyang Paper Mill are 4%-5% lower than last year.
    Another reason for the failure to complete the production plan is the high number of paper breaks on the paper machines—2,575 hours more than the same period last year for the entire bureau. Due to the increased downtime caused by breaks, 2,900 tons of paper less were produced, with Jinzhou Paper Mill alone producing more than 900 tons less.
    The reasons for the decrease in the finished product rate and the increase in the downtime caused by paper breaks are that factories, in order to pursue output value, do not implement operating procedures and simply increase the rotational speed of the paper machines. After the speed of the paper machines increased, there was a lack of necessary technical organization work, resulting in untimely supply of pulp and poor quality of the pulp supplied on time. In order to quickly change this situation and ensure the comprehensive completion of this year's state plan, the Paper Industry Administration Bureau, in addition to requiring all enterprises to strengthen technical organization work and earnestly implement operating procedures, is also preparing to hold an economic activity analysis meeting recently, and evaluate the plan execution of each enterprise, exchange and promote advanced experience.
    Editor's Note
    After reading the news that the paper industry failed to complete its production and quality plans, I was reminded of a fable titled "Heading North to Go South" in "Strategies of the Warring States."
    The fable says that the King of Wei, relying on his vast territory, well-trained army, and strong horses, attacked Handan to expand his territory and gain the trust of the world. After hearing the news, Ji Liang rushed to advise him, neglecting to tidy his clothes and brush the dust from his hair. He said, "Today I came from the Taihang Mountains and saw a man driving a cart north, wanting to go to the state of Chu. I asked him why he was going north to Chu instead of south. He said, 'My horse is fast.' I said, 'Although your horse is fast, this is not the way to Chu!' He said, 'I have a lot of money.' I said, 'Although you have a lot of money, this road does not lead to Chu!' He also said, 'My coachman is good.' The better these conditions are, the further you will be from Chu if you lose your way! If the king wants to gain the trust of the world by force, it is just like this person, and he will surely go further and further away from his destination!"
    In industrial production, disregarding product quality and blindly speeding up machines, and treating it as the only magic weapon to complete the state plan, the result will certainly be that the faster the machine turns, the more defective products there will be, and the more difficult it will be to complete the production tasks. This is the same principle as "heading north to go south"—the further you go, the further you are from your destination.
    It is unfounded to say that the Paper Industry Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Light Industry did not discover early enough that its subordinate enterprises were adopting the "heading north to go south" method to complete the plan. Because every enterprise has to report on the execution of various planned targets to it at the end of each month and quarter. However, the Paper Industry Administration Bureau did not issue "admonitions" early enough (if it wants to, it can also order them!), and only now plans to hold an economic activity analysis meeting. Is this because the leaders of this bureau lack Ji Liang's proactive spirit, or because they themselves also believe in the "heading north to go south" magic weapon?

### 追求产值，违反工艺规程  造纸工业产量、质量计划都没完成

    追求产值，违反工艺规程
    造纸工业产量、质量计划都没完成
    本报讯　轻工业部造纸工业管理局所属国营和公私合营企业，今年以来，虽然超额完成了国家总产值计划、劳动生产率计划、成本降低计划和上缴利润计划，但是没有完成产量计划和成品率计划。据一至六月份的统计，实际产量比国家计划少三千多吨；一至五月份的实际成品率，比国家计划低3％。按产品来计算，新闻纸、胶板纸、图板纸等主要品种的产量都没有完成。这种情况，直到现在还没有多大的改进。
    据造纸工业管理局计划科分析，产量计划没完成的原因，除了一些企业新安装的设备因材料供应不上而不能按期投入生产以外，主要的是成品率低。在全局所属二十五个企业单位（上海造纸公司所属二十多个工厂只算一个单位）中，只有广州、营口、太原三个国营造纸厂完成成品率计划。由于成品率没达到计划指标，共减少产量六千多吨。尤其严重的是，绝大部分企业的成品率都低于去年的实际水平。其中四川601造纸厂比去年低10％，国营宣化造纸厂（七月十五日本报社论误为地方国营）比去年低7％，北京造纸厂和沈阳造纸厂比去年低4％—5％。
    造成产量计划不能完成的另一个原因，是抄纸机的抄纸断头多——全局比去年同期多二千五百七十五个小时。由于断头时间多而少生产纸二千九百吨，其中锦州造纸厂一个厂就少产九百多吨。
    成品率降低和抄纸断头时间增加的原因，是工厂为了追求产值，不贯彻执行工艺规程，单纯加快抄纸机旋转速度。抄纸机速度增加以后，又缺乏必要的技术组织工作，结果纸浆供应不及时，供应及时的质量又不好。为了迅速改变这种状况，保证全面完成今年国家计划，造纸工业管理局除要求各企业加强技术组织工作，认真执行工艺规程外，还准备在最近召开经济活动分析会议，并且评比各企业的计划执行情况，交流和推广先进经验。
    编后杂感
    读了造纸工业没完成产量和质量计划的新闻以后，使我想起了“战国策”里一篇题为“南辕北辙”的寓言来。
    寓言说，魏王仗恃着自己的国土广大，兵精马强，去攻打邯郸，以扩充土地并且以此取信于天下。季梁得到消息以后，衣服也顾不得整理，头发上的尘土也顾不得拍一拍，就赶去劝他。说：“我今天从太行山来，看见一个人驾着车往北走，要到楚国去。我问他为什么到楚国去不向南走而向北走呢？他说：‘我的马快’。我说，马虽然快，但是这不是去楚国的路呀！他说：‘我的钱多’。我说，钱虽然多，但是这条路是不通楚国的啊！他又说：‘我的车夫好’。这些条件越好，要是迷失了方向，离楚国是越去越远的啊！大王想凭借武力取信于天下，正跟这个人一样，一定是越走离目的地越远的！”
    在工业生产上，不顾产品质量，一味加快机器速度，并且把它作为完成国家计划的唯一法宝，结果也一定是机器转的越快，废品越多，生产任务也就越完不成。这跟“南辕北辙”是一个道理，越走离目的地越远。
    说轻工业部造纸工业管理局没有及早发现所属企业采取“南辕北辙”的办法来完成计划，是没有根据的。因为每个企业，每到月末和季末，都要向它汇报各项计划指标的执行情况。然而造纸工业管理局没有及早地提出“劝告”（要是愿意的话，还可以命令呢！），到现在才打算召开经济活动分析会议。这是因为这个局的领导人员很缺乏季梁那种积极精神呢，还是因为他们自己也迷信“南辕北辙”的法宝呢？
