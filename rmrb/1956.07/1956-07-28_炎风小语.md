    The heart of youth is the most precious thing in the world.

    Some people claim to be youth leaders precisely because they have lost the heart of youth, and thus feel they have become "seniors" with the qualifications to guide young people.

    It is precisely from young people that they should learn.

    Complaining is the long suit of the petty bourgeoisie.

    Life is full of difficulties. Heroes regard themselves as masters of life, and see overcoming difficulties as their responsibility. Petty bourgeois people, on the other hand, regard themselves as creditors of life, only hoping that others will arrange everything comfortably for them, and will complain against God and man even if they cannot find a needle.

    Complaining does not help life to get better at all, it only poisons the atmosphere of society. In the dark corners of the petty bourgeoisie, filled with complaints, the whole world, all of humanity, seems to have become something unbearable.
                                ＊
    Love can make people strong, and it can also make people weak.

    Truly fulfilling love makes people feel the beauty of the whole life, and cannot tolerate even the slightest thing that defiles life.

    Forced, supposedly fulfilled love, makes people accustomed to deceiving themselves, recognizing ugliness as beauty, and thus many of the uglinesses in life can be ignored and taken for granted.
                                  ＊
    Thought has always been the most lively thing. Stagnant thought is not a state inherent in thought itself, but rather that the thought function has stopped being used, replaced by memory, recitation, echoing others, and so on.

    There is no secret to breaking down stagnant thought, the only effective weapon is thought itself. When people realize the difference between memory, recitation, echoing others, and true thought, the power of thought is invincible.
                                ＊
    The masses are an ocean of wisdom.

    Therefore, the bureaucrats in reactionary regimes cannot but be foolish. The higher their official position, the more they are in opposition to the masses, and the more they are far removed from the ocean of wisdom.

    And the leaders in revolutionary regimes, the more they assume higher responsibilities, the more they serve the greater interests of more people, the more they are able to concentrate the wisdom of the masses, making themselves people who embody a high degree of wisdom.

    Some bureaucrats do not understand this principle, believing that the position itself brings wisdom, and thus they are aloof, self-important, and refuse to concentrate the wisdom of the masses, with the result that they only endanger the revolutionary cause with their stupidity.

    炎风小语

    青年的心，是世界上最可宝贵的事物。
    有些人之所以以青年指导者自命，却正因为已经失去了青年的心，于是觉得自己成了“前辈”，有了指导青年的资格。
    应该向青年好好学习的，其实正是他们。
    抱怨，是小市民的长技。
    生活中有的是困难。英雄们把自己看作生活的主人，把战胜困难看作自己的责任。小市民们却把自己看作生活的债主，只盼望着别人替自己把一切安排得舒舒服服，找一根针找不着也要怨天尤人起来。
    抱怨丝毫不能帮助生活变好，只会毒化社会的空气。小市民的充满了抱怨的阴暗角落里，整个世界，所有人类，都仿佛成了使人忍受不了的东西。
                                ＊
    爱情能使人坚强，也能使人软弱。
    真正美满的爱情，使人感到整个生活的美丽，不能容忍任何一点玷辱生活的东西。
    强作美满的爱情，使人习惯于自欺欺人，认丑作美，于是对生活中许多的丑恶，都可以视若无睹，习为固然。
                                  ＊
    思想，从来就是最活泼的事物。思想僵化，并不是思想本身有这么一种状态，实在就是思想机能停止了运用，代之以记忆、背诵、随声附和，等等。
    打破思想僵化，别无秘诀，唯一有效的武器就是思想本身。当人们觉悟到记忆、背诵、随声附和等等同真正的思想的区别的时候，思想的力量是无敌的。
                                ＊
    群众是智慧的海洋。
    所以，反动政权中的官僚，不可能不是愚蠢的。他们官做得越高，越是同群众处于对立的地位，越是与智慧的海洋远离。
    而革命政权中的领导人，越是负了高级的责任，越是为更多的群众的更大的利益服务，便越是能够集中群众的智慧，使自己成为体现了高度智慧的人。
    某些官僚主义者却不懂这个道理，以为职位本身会带来智慧，于是高高在上，自命不凡，拒绝集中群众的智慧，结果只有以其愚蠢危害革命的事业。
