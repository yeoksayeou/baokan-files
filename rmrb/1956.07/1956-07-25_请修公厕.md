    After liberation, a public toilet was built near Ziyou Road in the Wuchang District of Wuhan City, which made things very convenient for the residents of Wuchang's Ziyou Road, Jiefang Road, Minzhu Road, Qinglong Alley, Yanwang Street, and other places. Recently, because a beautiful guesthouse was built near this toilet, the toilet was closed down. As a result, thousands of residents in the vicinity have to go to public toilets far away to defecate and urinate, which is very inconvenient. It is hoped that the city's public health authorities will build another public toilet in the residential areas. (A group of residents)

    请修公厕
    解放以后，武汉市武昌区自由路附近修建了一个公共厕所，这使武昌自由路，解放路、民主路，青龙巷，延望街等地的居民都感到非常方便。最近，因为这个厕所附近盖起了一个漂亮的招待所，厕所就被查封了。于是，附近数千居民，往往要跑到很远的公共厕所去大、小便，非常不便。希望市的公共卫生机关在这些居民住的地区另修一个公共厕所。　（一群居民）
