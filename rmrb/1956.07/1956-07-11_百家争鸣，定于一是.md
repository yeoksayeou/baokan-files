There is a folk story about two people with limited literacy who came to the Confucius Temple. They saw two large characters on the plaque of the gate tower. One said it was "Wen Chao" (文朝), and the other said it was "You Miao" (又庙). Both were very confident and argued endlessly. This simple story is quite enlightening when applied to the question of "Letting a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend."

What these two people saw was partly correct and partly wrong. By correcting the wrong part and affirming the correct part, one can arrive at the correct conclusion. We easily laugh at these two people with limited literacy, but in reality, everyone's knowledge is limited, because everyone sees things from a certain perspective and has a limited scope of contact, plus differences in eyesight. Each of us is somewhat like these two people with limited literacy, and even "senior intellectuals" are no exception. The benefit of "Letting a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend" lies in this: it brings together many people with different perspectives, seeing facts from different starting points and areas of contact, correcting each other's errors, and affirming each other's correctness. Thus, "Wen Chao" and "You Miao" can produce "Wen Miao" (文庙, Temple of Confucius). "Letting a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend" is "collective wisdom," it is believing that truth can only be obtained by grasping comprehensive facts and analyzing them thoroughly. Therefore, it embodies the true spirit of science, and at the same time, it is trusting in the wisdom of the masses, so it embodies the true spirit of democracy.

Let a hundred schools of thought contend, but ultimately must arrive at a unified conclusion. If Person A insists on "Wen Chao" to the end! Person B insists on "You Miao" to the end! The result of the contention will only be that the speakers are like angry frogs, their voices growing louder and louder, and the listeners find their ears unable to find peace. Since there is contention, there is always a question, and the purpose of contention is always to solve this question. We are by no means contending for the sake of contending; we want to take a scientific step forward on the issue in contention. This so-called "step forward" is, of course, best if the problem is solved; if the problem is not yet solved, then summarize the arguments and loopholes of each side of the debate, understand the crux of the problem, and the difficulties in solving it. This will prepare for the next step of research and is still beneficial to the development of science.

Arriving at a unified conclusion is the ultimate goal of letting a hundred schools of thought contend. How can we contend in order to take the fastest and most stable path to achieve this goal? This is a question that we must seriously consider at present. When the Party is vigorously advancing towards science, it put forward the policy of "Letting a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend" in order to correct the deviations of some subjective dogmatism and vulgar sociology in the past, establish a healthy atmosphere of free academic debate, and enable science to develop vigorously. This is the bright path of socialist cultural construction, and it is also the correct application of Marxism-Leninism. Some people, seeing the need to break down "rigid rules and regulations," inevitably mistakenly believe that this is relaxing the standards of Marxism-Leninism, and even privately rejoice, thinking that this is in line with their view that Marxism-Leninism does not apply to literature and art and natural sciences. These people seem to think that we have made some subjective dogmatic and vulgar sociological deviations in the past because we wanted to promote Marxism everywhere. In fact, subjective dogmatism and vulgar sociology are precisely anti-Marxist. In the past, some people inevitably sometimes used the banner of Marxism to do anti-Marxist things, but this crime cannot be attributed to Marxism. On the contrary, in order to achieve the goal of unity through contention, we must learn to correctly apply Marxism.

Letting a hundred schools of thought contend can be said to be the correct application of the Marxist weapon of criticism and self-criticism. The unhealthiest atmosphere in the academic world is the absence of public right and wrong. Without public right and wrong, people each consider themselves right and others wrong, so that right and wrong are confused and no one can agree. The function of correct criticism and self-criticism is to establish public right and wrong. In the past, we were not skilled enough in using criticism and self-criticism, so sometimes it was not correct enough. The worst phenomenon is attacking the person instead of the issue, trying to subdue people instead of solving the problem, and using the method of indiscriminately labeling people. The phenomenon of seeing problems one-sidedly is especially prevalent. A philosopher must be either idealistic or materialistic. To which category does Confucius belong? Some people affirm that he is idealistic, and some people affirm that he is materialistic. Is it possible that an idealistic person may have some materialistic elements? Is it also possible that a materialistic person may have some idealistic elements? Simply affirming "idealistic" or "materialistic" is a convenient method that is more suitable for the appetite of lazy people, so it is also a more popular method. Authoritative thinking is also sometimes at work. After some authoritative figures have assessed the value of Jia Baoyu and Li Houzhu, that is the "final verdict," and no further dissent is allowed. These ideological problems are often committed by most of us to varying degrees. They are all different forms of expression of subjective dogmatism, obstacles to criticism and self-criticism, and obstacles to achieving unity through contention. If opposing subjective dogmatism can be considered a "rigid rule and regulation," then letting a hundred schools of thought contend should also have its rigid rules and regulations.

From letting a hundred schools of thought contend to arriving at a unified conclusion, we must go through a difficult process of repeated discussion, comprehensive analysis, and synthesis. Being too eager for quick success or making simplistic conclusions does not help the development of science, so contention must be thorough. In the past, when we held political study or business discussion meetings in schools, the thinking outline often listed three or four major topics, and each major topic was divided into several minor topics. These many topics were discussed by ten or twenty people within two or three hours. As a result, each topic was touched superficially, but none of the topics could be discussed in depth. This kind of formalistic discussion cannot solve problems. We still need to learn in this regard. The way to start is to select some key issues that are relatively likely to arouse the interest of most people in several important disciplines and carry out extensive discussions. For example, when did Chinese feudal society begin? Are there parts of speech in Chinese grammar? Is a certain philosopher in the history of Chinese philosophy idealistic or materialistic? What is the relationship and difference between image thinking and abstract thinking in literature and art? These types of questions are of concern to most people. First, the proposer of a certain theory should write out his or her arguments and proofs in concise and accessible language, and let his or her opponents do the same, and then mobilize the masses to conduct in-depth discussions from different angles. At an appropriate stage, make a comprehensive summary. This kind of contention is a good training for scientific workers, and it is also a good scientific education for the broad masses of readers.

    百家争鸣，定于一是
    朱光潜
    民间有个故事，说有两个识字不多的人走到孔庙，望见门楼匾额上两个大字，甲说是“文朝”，乙说是“又庙”，两人自己都很有把握，相持不下。这个简单的故事应用到“百家争鸣”的问题上来，是颇有启发性的。
    这两人所见到的都有一部分是正确的，一部分是错误的。纠正错误的部分，肯定正确的部分，就可以得到正确的结论。我们很容易嗤笑这两位识字不多的人，其实人的知识都是有限的，因为每个人看事物，都有一定的出发角度和接触面的限度，还加上眼力的差别。我们每个人都有些像这两位识字不多的人，连“高级知识分子”也不是例外。百家争鸣的好处就在此，它集合许多眼力不同的人，从不同的出发角度和接触面所看到的事实，互相纠正错误的，肯定正确的，于是“文朝”与“又庙”就可以产生“文庙”了。百家争鸣就是“集思广益”，就是相信真理是要从掌握全面事实而加以周密分析才可以得到，所以体现着真正科学的精神，同时，这也就是信任群众的智慧，所以体现着真正民主的精神。
    百家争鸣，终须定于一是。如果甲坚持“文朝”到底！乙坚持“又庙”到底；争的结果就只能是鸣者如怒蛙，气越鼓越大，听者也嫌耳根不得清净。既争就总有个问题，争的目的总是要解决这个问题。我们决不是为争鸣而争鸣，我们是要就所争的问题在科学上前进一步。这里所谓“前进一步”如果是问题的解决，那自然最好；如果还不是问题的解决，就把争论各方的论证和漏洞总结起来，知道了问题的症结所在，解决的困难所在，这也就是为下一步研究作了准备，对于科学的发展仍是有益的。
    定于一是，这是百家争鸣的最终目的。怎样争鸣，才可以走最迅速而又最稳健的道路达到这个目的呢？这是目前我们所要郑重考虑的问题。党在我们大力向科学进军的时候，提出了“百家争鸣”的方针，为的是要纠正过去一些主观教条主义和庸俗社会学的偏差，建立学术自由争论的健康风气，使科学可以蓬勃地发展起来。这是社会主义文化建设的光明大道，也是马克思列宁主义的正确的运用。有些人看到了要破除“清规戒律”，不免误认为这是放宽马克思列宁主义的尺度，甚至于私自庆幸，以为这符合自己的马克思列宁主义不适用于文艺和自然科学的看法。这些人仿佛以为我们过去犯了一些主观教条主义和庸俗社会学的偏差，原因就在于要到处推行马克思主义。其实主观教条主义和庸俗社会学恰恰都是反马克思主义的。过去固然不免有人有时打着马克思主义的招牌，做着反马克思主义的勾当，但是这宗罪过决不能记在马克思主义的账上。相反地，百家争鸣，要想达到定于一是的目的，我们就非学会正确地运用马克思主义不可。
    百家争鸣可以说就是批评与自我批评这个马克思主义武器的正确的运用。学术界最不健康的风气就是无公是公非，无公是公非，人们才各是其是，各非其非，以至于是非混淆，莫衷一是。正确的批评与自我批评的功用就在建立公是公非。过去我们对于批评与自我批评，运用得不够熟练，所以有时就不够正确。最坏的现象是对人不对事，要压服人而不是要解决问题，压服的办法是乱扣帽子。片面看问题的现象尤其普遍。一个哲学家总得是唯心的或是唯物的，孔子究竟属于哪一类？有人肯定他是唯心的，也有人肯定他是唯物的。是否唯心的人可能有些唯物的因素呢？唯物的人也可能有些唯心的因素呢？简单地肯定“唯心”或“唯物”是个比较适合懒汉口胃的省事的办法，所以也是比较流行的办法。权威思想有时也在作祟，贾宝玉和李后主经过一些权威人士估过价了，那就是“定评”，不容再有异议。这些思想上的毛病是我们多数人在不同的程度上都时常犯的。它们都是主观教条主义的不同形式的表现，是批评与自我批评的障碍，也就是百家争鸣达到定于一是的障碍。假如反主观教条主义也算是“清规戒律”的话，那么，百家争鸣也就还应该有它的清规戒律。
    由百家争鸣到定于一是，要经过反复讨论，全面分析与综合的艰苦过程，过于求速成或是作简单化的结论是无补于科学发展的，所以争鸣就要争得彻底。过去我们在学校开政治学习或业务方面的讨论会，思考提纲往往列出三四道大题，每个大题又分若干小题，把这许多题目交一二十人在两三小时以内讨论完，结果每个题目都浮面一铲地触到，但是没有一个题目能谈得深入。这种形式主义的讨论是不能解决问题的。我们在这方面还要经过一番学习。入手的办法是在若干重要学科里挑选一些关键性的而且比较能引起多数人兴趣的问题，展开广泛的讨论。例如中国封建社会是什么时候开始的？中国语法有无词类？中国哲学史某个哲学家是唯心的还是唯物的？文艺的形象思维和抽象思维有什么关系和分别？这一类问题都是多数人所关心的。先由某一说的提议人把他的论点和论证用简要通俗的文字写出来，让他的论敌也照办，然后发动群众从不同的角度进行深入的讨论，到了一个适当的阶段，再作一个全面性的总结。这种的争鸣对于科学工作者是一个很好的训练，对于广大的读者群众也是一种很好的科学教育。
