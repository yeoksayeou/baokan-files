Xinhua News Agency, 6th. The Liaison Committee of the Central Committee of the China Democratic League convened a meeting on the morning of July 4th, attended by National People's Congress representatives who are League members in Beijing, and heads of the League from various regions, to discuss the issue of carrying out work on contacting social intellectuals.

    Deng Chumin, Director of the Liaison Committee of the China Democratic League, said at the meeting: Contacting social intellectuals is one of the important tasks of the China Democratic League for a considerable period of time to come. He said: For the sake of socialist revolution and socialist construction, it is necessary to expand and strengthen the united front, unite all who can be united, and bring everyone's strength into play. He requested that League organizations in various regions designate specific personnel or establish appropriate institutions to carry out this work in a planned manner. Deng Chumin said that the purpose of our contacting them is to help them improve their thinking, help them do their work, and give full play to their strengths; for social intellectuals who are potentially employable but currently lack the subjective conditions, we must help them create employment conditions.

    During the discussion, everyone put forward many suggestions on how to conduct ideological education for social intellectuals. Attendees at the meeting believed that various methods could be adopted to help them raise their socialist consciousness, such as regularly organizing studies of current events and policies, organizing visits, holding report meetings, and providing assistance and education through the personal relationships of League members.

    民盟中央号召所属组织
    开展联系社会知识分子工作
    新华社6日讯　中国民主同盟中央委员会联络委员会在七月四日上午召集在北京的盟员中的全国人民代表大会代表、民盟各地负责人，讨论开展联系社会知识分子的工作问题。
    民盟联络委员会主任委员邓初民在会上说：联系社会知识分子，是民盟今后相当长时期内的重要工作之一。他说：为了社会主义革命和社会主义建设，必须扩大和加强统一战线，团结一切可以团结的人，发挥大家的力量。他要求民盟各地组织指定专人或是成立适当的机构，有计划地开展这一工作。邓初民说，我们联系他们的目的，是为了帮助他们提高思想，帮助他们做工作，发挥他们的所长；对可能就业而目前主观条件不够的社会知识分子，要帮助他们创造就业条件。
    在讨论中，大家对如何向社会知识分子进行思想教育问题提出了许多建议。出席会议的人认为可以采取定期组织学习时事政策、组织参观、举办报告会、通过盟员私人关系进行帮助和教育等各种方法，帮助他们提高社会主义觉悟。
