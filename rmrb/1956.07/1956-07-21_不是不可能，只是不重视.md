It's Not Impossible, Just Not Valued
	Wang Qi

    Recently, the North China Directly Subordinate Engineering Company of the Ministry of Construction Engineering conducted an inspection of the living welfare facilities for workers at various project sites under its jurisdiction. It was found that although the living conditions of construction workers have greatly improved, the existing problems are still very serious.

    First is the housing problem. Generally, the worker sheds at construction sites are built very simply, with poor lighting, ventilation, cold protection, and moisture-proofing equipment. Some sheds can't even keep out wind and rain. The worker sheds built by the Fourth Engineering Office of the North China Taiyuan Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Construction Engineering leak every time it rains; when it stops raining outside, it still rains inside. Workers' bedding and belongings are often soaked by the rain, making it impossible to sleep. They angrily say: "We work in assembly lines during the day, and sit through the night in assembly lines at night!" At the 401 construction site of the Fourth Engineering Office of the North China Directly Subordinate Engineering Company, the worker sheds are so damp that grass more than a foot high grows under the beds; some sheds are too crowded, with each worker having less than one meter of space to sleep, making it impossible to stretch out. Many workers have developed back pain or arthritis as a result.

    The eating conditions are also very poor. Many construction units one-sidedly emphasize thrift, and even save on dining halls for workers. At some construction sites of the North China Datong Engineering General Company of the Ministry of Construction Engineering, workers eat in the open air. Datong has a lot of wind and sand, and the food that thousands of workers line up to buy is mostly cold, with some dust blown on it. Many workers have developed stomach problems as a result. At one construction site of this engineering company with more than a thousand people, there is only one boiler, and workers have to wait in line to drink water during production hours.

    Construction workers need to shower frequently, but many construction units make showering and haircuts very inconvenient. Although some units issue one or two shower and haircut vouchers per month, workers cannot get haircuts and showers at any time because they are far from the city. The North China Baotou Engineering General Company of the Ministry of Construction Engineering has six or seven construction units in the new urban area of Baotou, but only one engineering office has shower facilities. The new urban area is forty miles away from the city, and it takes at least two hours to travel back and forth by car, plus an additional eight cents for the fare, making it a big problem for workers to shower. Recently, relevant units established a public bathhouse in the new urban area, but the ticket price is too high, and it still cannot solve the problem of workers' showers. The environmental sanitation of many construction sites is also very poor.

    The poor living conditions of construction workers directly affect the workers' attendance rate. In 1955, state-owned construction units under the North China Engineering Management Bureau of the Ministry of Construction Engineering had more than 140,000 workdays of sick leave, which is equivalent to more than 5,000 workers not working for a month.

    In fact, it is not impossible to solve the housing and living problems of construction workers. Judging from the source of funds alone, not only has the state allocated a large amount of funds to solve these problems long ago, but also various enterprises have accumulated a considerable amount of enterprise bonus funds that can be used for a long time. Taking the worker shed problem of the Fourth Engineering Office of the North China Taiyuan Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Construction Engineering as an example, the money allocated by the state can build an average of three square meters of worker shed for each worker, and the cost per square meter is 20 yuan. With so much money, it is entirely possible to build worker sheds that are not wet, not leaky, not collapsing, not crowded, well-ventilated, and well-lit. However, during construction, the leaders of the engineering office disregarded the design regulations and thinned the front and rear walls of the worker sheds. The first work section responsible for construction also reduced the height of the walls and did not use materials or build the roof according to the design regulations. How can such worker sheds not be too simple?

    The problem of workers' showers is also not difficult to solve. The Xiaotangshan construction site of the North China Datong Engineering General Company built its own bathhouse last year, with a total monthly expenditure of 400 yuan for coal, water, electricity, and labor, which is more than 100 yuan cheaper than issuing shower vouchers.

    The dining hall problem can also be solved. In the past, none of the units under the North China Baotou Engineering General Company of the Ministry of Construction Engineering that have been working in the Baotou area all year round had a dining hall, and employees ate in the open air. This year, the company's leaders paid attention to this problem, and within less than a month, they used enterprise bonus funds to establish dining halls in all construction units. These dining halls not only allow employees to eat hot meals, but can also be used for meetings and studies, which the employees are very satisfied with. The company's leaders also actively and proactively used the welfare facilities already built by Party A as employee dormitories, and paid attention to environmental sanitation. With better living conditions, employees' production enthusiasm has increased even more. Since the beginning of this year, the company has overfulfilled the state plan every month, which is a rare new phenomenon in recent years.

    It can be seen from this that it is entirely possible to improve the living conditions of construction workers. The only question is whether the leaders of construction enterprises attach importance to this work.

    不是不可能，只是不重视
    汪圻
    最近，建筑工程部华北直属工程公司对所属各工程处工地的职工生活福利设施进行了一次检查。发现建筑工人的生活条件虽然已经有了很大的改善，但是存在的问题仍然很严重。
    首先是居住问题。一般施工现场的工棚大都盖得很简陋，采光、通风、防寒和防潮的设备很差，有的工棚甚至连风雨都挡不住。建筑工程部华北太原工程局第四工程处盖的工棚，每逢雨天，外面下雨，屋里也下雨；外面雨停了，屋里还不停。工人的被褥物品常常被雨淋湿，无法睡觉，他们气愤地说：“我们白天施工是流水作业，晚上睡觉是流水坐夜！”华北直属工程公司第四工程处401工地，工棚潮得厉害，床底下都长了一尺多高的草；有的工棚过于拥挤，每个工人睡觉的地方平均不到一公尺，根本不能伸直睡觉，不少工人因此得了腰疼病或关节炎。
    吃饭的条件也很坏。不少建筑单位片面强调节约，连工人吃饭的饭厅都给节约掉了。建筑工程部华北大同工程总公司有的工地，工人都站在露天地里吃饭。大同风沙较大，上千名工人排队买到饭菜大都凉了，再吹上些沙尘，不少工人因此得了胃病。这个工程公司一个一千多人的工地上，只有一个锅炉，工人们在生产时间喝水都得排队等。
    建筑工人需要经常洗澡，但是许多施工单位洗澡、理发很不方便。有的单位虽然每月发一两张洗澡票、理发票，但是因为距离市区较远，工人也不能随时理发洗澡。建筑工程部华北包头工程总公司在包头新市区有六、七个施工单位，只有一个工程处有洗澡设备，新市区距离市区四十里路，坐汽车往返至少需要两小时，还得加上八角钱的车票，工人洗澡便大成问题。最近，有关单位在新市区建立了公共澡堂，但是票价过高，仍旧不能解决工人洗澡的问题。不少建筑工地的环境卫生，也搞得很糟。
    建筑工人的居住、生活条件不好，直接影响了工人的出勤率。建筑工程部华北工程管理总局所属国营建筑单位，在1955年有十四万多个工日的病假，等于五千多个工人一个月没有干活。
    其实，建筑工人的居住、生活问题并不是没有办法解决的。单从经费来源上看，不但国家为解决这些问题早就拨付了大批经费，而且各企业也长时期积压了相当数额的企业奖励基金可以使用。就以上述建筑工程部华北太原工程局第四工程处的工棚问题为例，国家拨给他们的钱平均可以给每个工人建筑三平方公尺的工棚，每平方公尺的造价是二十元。用这么多的钱，完全可以建筑不湿、不漏、不塌、不挤，通风舒畅，光线充足的工棚。但是在施工的时候，工程处领导人员不顾设计规定，把工棚前墙，后墙改薄了，负责施工的第一工段又降低了墙的高度，并且没有按照设计的规定用料，也没有按照设计的规定修屋顶，这样的工棚怎么能够不过于简陋呢？
    工人洗澡的问题，也是不难解决的。华北大同工程总公司小汤山工地去年自己修建了一个澡堂，每月煤、水、电和人工开支共四百元，比发澡票还省一百多元。
    饭厅问题同样可以解决。建筑工程部华北包头工程总公司所属的常年在包头地区施工的单位，过去没有一个饭厅，职工都站在露天地里吃饭。今年公司领导人员重视了这个问题，不到一个月就利用企业奖励基金在所有施工单位普遍建立了饭厅。这些饭厅不仅可以使职工吃到热饭热菜，还可以用来开会和学习，职工们都很满意。这个公司的领导人员还积极主动地利用甲方已经建好的福利设施作为职工宿舍，并注意了环境卫生。生活条件好了，职工的生产情绪更加高了，今年以来，这个公司每个月都超额完成了国家计划，这是历年来少见的新气象。
    由此可见，把建筑工人的居住，生活条件搞得好一些，是完全可能的，问题只是在于建筑企业的领导人员是否重视这项工作。
