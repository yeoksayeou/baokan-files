Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, July 7th. This first half of the year, the various construction units of Anshan Iron and Steel Company saved 4,000 tons of steel and more than 4,000 tons of cement, exceeding the state's required savings targets.

    In order to reduce the consumption of these two building materials, each construction unit has formulated technical measures. In terms of saving steel, high-strength cold-drawn steel bars and threaded steel bars are used to replace ordinary round steel, which generally reduces steel consumption by about 15%. The Waterway Engineering Company and the Metal Structure Manufacturing Plant, with the permission of the technical supervision department, utilized more than 800 tons of old steel and residual steel. In terms of saving cement, many construction sites have adopted a large amount of dry-hard concrete, which saves more than 15% of cement compared to ordinary concrete. In foundation bedding projects, low-grade concrete mixed with a large amount of tailings powder is mostly used, reducing cement consumption by 15 kilograms per cubic meter.

    鞍山钢铁公司各个建设单位
    上半年节约钢材水泥各四千吨
    新华社鞍山7日电　今年上半年，鞍山钢铁公司的各个建设单位，节约了四千吨钢材和四千多吨水泥，超过了国家所要求的节约指标。
    为了降低这两种建筑材料的消耗量，各建设单位都制定了技术措施。在节约钢材方面，用高强度的冷拉钢筋、螺纹钢筋代替普通圆钢，钢筋消耗量一般都能减少15％左右。水道工程公司和金属结构制造厂，经过技术监督部门允许，利用了八百多吨旧钢材和残余钢材。在节约水泥方面，许多建筑工地大量采用干硬性混凝土，比用一般混凝土节约水泥15％以上。在基础垫层工程上，大都使用了掺入多量尾矿粉的低标号混凝土，每立方公尺少用水泥十五公斤。
