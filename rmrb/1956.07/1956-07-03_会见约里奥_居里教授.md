    Meeting Professor Joliot-Curie
    Yao Yun
    On June 13th, the itinerary of the Chinese cultural delegation visiting France included an extraordinary event – a visit to the "Institute of Professor Joliot-Curie of the Collège de France." Professor Joliot-Curie is a great contemporary scientist and an active peace fighter, currently serving as the Chairman of the World Peace Council. Being able to visit the place where such a great scientist works and thinks made everyone in the delegation feel very excited.

    Our car quickly passed through the bustling commercial district of Paris, turned into the Latin Quarter, a traditional area concentrated with schools and students, and stopped in front of the ornate iron gates of the Collège de France. Upon entering the hall of the college, we saw a wooden door on the left with a white magnetic sign: "Institute of Nuclear Physics and Chemistry." This is the world-renowned laboratory originally established by Maria Curie (i.e., Madame Curie, the discoverer of radium). Her son-in-law and successor in scientific endeavors, Professor Joliot-Curie, has been working here for twenty years since 1936. Now, the professor's daughter, Hélène Joliot-Curie, also works here.

    Professor Su, an assistant to Professor Joliot-Curie, came out to greet us. He told us that the professor was at the institute, and although he was not in good health, he was very willing to meet the Chinese cultural delegation upon learning of their visit. This news made us overjoyed because we heard that the professor's health was not very good due to long hours of hard work. Recently, his wife passed away, and the professor was currently resting. We never expected that we would be able to meet this scientist, who is admired by people all over the world, today.

    Everyone followed Professor Su up one floor in the elevator, walked a short distance down a corridor, and arrived in front of Room 18. The white door opened, and Professor Joliot-Curie stood at the door, warmly shaking hands with each member of the Chinese cultural delegation. He was of medium height, dressed in a dark blue suit, with a serious yet approachable face.

    He invited us to sit down in his office. This office was about six or seven meters square, with file cabinets all around. Near the door, there was a desk covered with manuscripts. The yellow light of the desk lamp illuminated the open pages, revealing that the professor had interrupted his work to receive us. The professor told us that he had been resting some time ago and had just begun to resume work. Behind this desk was a row of cabinets against the wall, with chemical element tables and atomic stability and radioactivity tables affixed to the doors. Diagonally opposite the desk was a large blackboard. The overall impression of the office was simple and unadorned.

    Hou Debang, the head of the Chinese cultural delegation and a scientist specializing in physical chemistry, told Professor Joliot-Curie that the Chinese people have always admired the professor's contributions to physics and the peaceful utilization of atomic energy, as well as his role in the world peace movement, and hoped that the professor would take good care of his health.

    The professor nodded slightly, humbly thanking the Chinese delegation for their concern. He then asked about some Chinese scientists he knew. He said, "We have long established cooperation with Chinese scientists. There have always been Chinese scientists working in this institute, which can be said to have become a tradition." He also said, "Chinese scientists are very serious, very intelligent, and have a spirit of research and creativity. They are very good workers." The professor's warm words were a great encouragement to Chinese scientists who are striving to catch up with the world's advanced levels in science in a short period of time.

    The professor continued, "We understand China. The Chinese and French people have common feelings and reactions towards life and things. Professor Langevin has been to China in the past, and he felt excited about his visit and meetings in China."

    Hou Debang said, "The friendship between our two peoples has always existed!"

    Professor Curie nodded and said, "Yes, in the peace movement, Guo Moruo and I are often together. Although we do not speak a common language, we understand each other completely."

    Talking about culture, and knowing that there were painters in the Chinese delegation, the professor's interest was even greater. He told us that he had paintings by Qi Baishi at home. He said, "He is a great painter." He then mentioned that the Chinese Peking Opera Troupe "left an amazing impact in France" last year, and his wife and daughter went to see the Peking Opera. Now, he still has Chinese records at home, and can hear the sounds of Chinese silk and bamboo instruments and drums. He said, "Eastern music has already had an impact in Europe, which can be said to be progress." As he said this, the professor even imitated the sounds of Chinese musical instruments, and everyone laughed.

    At this time, the professor said thoughtfully, "Artists love peace, and scientists have a responsibility for peace!"

    In order not to cause Professor Joliot-Curie too much fatigue, the Chinese cultural delegation prepared to bid farewell. But the professor said, "Your coming here to talk to me is even better for my health." Hou Debang presented the professor with a Fuzhou lacquer bottle brought from China. The professor placed the bottle on his desk, carefully examining it and repeatedly praising the exquisite Chinese handicrafts. The cordial conversation seemed unable to stop, but it was already late, and everyone had to say goodbye. The professor stood up and shook Hou Debang's hand tightly, saying, "Please convey my love to the Chinese people and Chinese scientists."

    The professor asked his assistant to guide us on a tour of the institute. Everyone took the elevator to the ground floor. In a room deep underground, a cyclotron was installed. This reactor can increase the energy of nucleons to eight million electron volts. Three or four scientists wearing white work clothes, with instruments that can detect radiation hanging on their bodies, were operating the research equipment here. They explained it in detail to the Chinese cultural delegation.

    The delegation then visited other laboratories, where reactors could be used to measure the direction of nucleon movement by the light quantity of nucleons, as well as to measure the energy of helium nucleons, etc. A Japanese female scientist demonstrated a reactor for us. She told us that the Chinese scientist Qian Sanqiang used to work with her in this laboratory.

    The entire institute has six floors, and there are now fifty or sixty scientists working there, twenty-six of whom have doctoral degrees. The institute's funding is allocated by the government. However, the staff of the institute said that the funding here is insufficient.

    After the tour, Hou Debang, the head of the Chinese cultural delegation, wrote an inscription in the institute's commemorative album, expressing congratulations on the institute's achievements. The staff of the institute asked the painters of the delegation to draw a few strokes for them. Wang Xuetao, a Chinese painter who always paints with a brush, took out a pen and drew a dove on the commemorative album on the spot. Giving this work symbolizing "peace" to the institute led by Professor Joliot-Curie can be said to be the most appropriate blessing.

    On the way back, everyone was still enthusiastically discussing this unforgettable meeting and Professor Joliot-Curie – the great scientist born in 1900 who made invaluable contributions to mankind.

    会见约里奥——居里教授
    姚云
    六月十三日，在法国访问的中国文化代表团日程表上排着一项不平常的节目——参观“法兰西学院约里奥—居里教授的研究所。”约里奥—居里教授是当代伟大的科学家，同时又是一位积极的和平战士，现在担任着世界和平理事会主席的职务。能够有机会参观这样一位大科学家工作、思考的地方，使代表团每个人都感觉十分兴奋。
    汽车载着我们很快地驶过巴黎喧闹的商业区，折入传统的学校和学生集中的地方——拉丁区，在法兰西学院的雕花大铁门前停下。进入学院的门厅，就看到左方又有一座木门，旁边挂着一块白色的磁牌：“核子物理和化学研究所”。这就是最初由玛丽亚·居里（即发现镭的居里夫人）建立的名闻世界的实验室，她的女婿和科学事业的继任人约里奥—居里教授从1936年起来到这里主持工作已经有二十年。现在，教授的女儿海伦·约里奥—居里也已经在这里工作了。
    约里奥—居里教授的一位助手苏教授出来迎接我们。他告诉我们，教授正在研究所，他虽然身体不好，但是知道中国文化代表团来访问，极愿意见见中国代表团。这个消息使我们高兴得不知道说什么是好，因为我们听说，教授由于长期辛勤的工作，健康情况不很好，最近，他的夫人去世了，教授目前正在休养中，想不到今天我们就能够见到这位受全世界人民景仰的科学家。
    大家跟着苏教授乘电梯登上一层楼，走过一小段走廊，来到第十八号房间门前。白色的门打开了，约里奥—居里教授站在门边，同中国文化代表团团员们一一热烈握手。他是中等身材，穿着一身深蓝色的服装，严肃而平易近人的面貌。
    他招呼着我们到他的办公室里坐下。这间办公室，六、七公尺见方，四围都摆着资料柜。靠近门的地方，放着一张写字桌，桌上摊着一些稿件，黄色的桌灯灯光照着翻开的几页，可以看出教授为了接见我们而打断了自己的工作。教授告诉我们，他前些时候在休养，现在刚刚开始恢复工作。在这张书桌的后面，是一排靠墙的橱，橱门上贴着化学原素表以及原子稳定性和放射性表。书桌的斜对面，架着一块大黑板，整个办公室给人的印象是简单朴素。
    中国文化代表团团长侯德榜是一位研究物理化学的科学家，他对约里奥—居里教授说，中国人民一向景仰教授在物理学和和平利用原子能方面的贡献以及在世界和平运动中的作用，希望教授好好保重身体。
    教授微微颔首，谦逊地感谢中国代表团的慰问。他接着问起一些他所认识的中国科学家。他说：“我们跟中国科学家早已建立起合作，在这个研究所一直有中国科学家在工作，这可以说已经成为传统了。”他还说：“中国科学家很严肃，很聪敏，很有钻研和创造精神，是很好的工作者”。教授温暖的话，对于正在为争取在短时期内使中国科学赶上世界先进水平的中国科学家来说，是莫大的鼓舞。
    教授接着说下去：“我们对中国是了解的。中法人民对于生活、对于事物有着共同的感情和反应。郎芝万教授过去曾经到过中国，他对于在中国的访问和会见感到兴奋。”
    侯德榜说：“我们两国人民的友谊是一向存在的！”
    居里教授点点头说：“是的，在和平运动中，我和郭沫若常在一起，虽然我们不是说共同的语言，但相互之间是完全了解的。”
    谈到文化，并且知道中国代表团中有画家，教授兴致更高了。他告诉我们，他家里有齐白石的画。他说：“这是一个伟大的画家。”他接着谈到去年中国京剧团在“法国留下了惊人的影响”，他的夫人和女儿都去看了京剧。现在他家里还有着中国的唱片，可以听到中国的丝竹锣鼓声。他说，“东方的音乐已经在欧洲有了影响，这可以说是一个进展。”说到这里，教授还模仿着中国乐器的声音，大家都笑起来了。
    这时，教授深思地说：“艺术家热爱和平，而科学家对和平是负有责任的！”
    为了不致使约里奥—居里教授过于劳累，中国文化代表团准备告辞。但是教授说：“你们来这里和我谈话，对我的身体更有好处。”侯德榜把从中国带来的一个福建漆的瓶子送给教授，教授把瓶子放在自己的书桌上，仔细端详，连声称赞中国手工艺品的精美。彼此亲切的谈话似乎不能休止，但是时间已经很晚，大家不能不告别了。教授站起身来，紧紧地握着侯德榜的手说：“请向中国人民、中国科学家转达我的热爱。”
    教授让他的助手引导我们参观这个研究所。大家乘电梯到达底层。在一间深藏在地下的屋子里，装设着回旋加速器，这个反应器能使核子的能量增加到八百万电子伏特。三、四位科学家穿着白色的工作服，身上挂着可以测知放射线的仪器，在操纵着这里的研究设备，他们详细地向中国文化代表团作解释。
    代表团然后又参观了另外一些实验室，那里的反应器可以由核子的光量测验核子走动方向，以及量氦核子的能量等等。有一位日本女科学家把一架反应器表演给我们看。她告诉我们，中国科学家钱三强从前就在这间实验室和她一起工作。
    整个研究所一共六层，现在有五、六十位科学家在工作，其中二十六位是博士一级的。研究所的经费由政府拨给。但是，研究所的工作人员说，这里的经费是不足的。
    参观完毕之后，中国文化代表团团长侯德榜在研究所的纪念册上提词，对于研究所的成就表示祝贺。研究所的工作人员要求代表团的画家给他们画几笔，一向用毛笔作画的中国画家王雪涛拿出钢笔，当场在纪念册上画了一幅鸽子。把这幅象征“和平”的作品赠给约里奥—居里教授所领导的研究所可以说是最恰当的祝颂了。
    归途上，大家还是热烈地谈论这次难忘的会见和约里奥—居里教授——这位生于1900年的、为人类作出了难于估价的贡献的伟大科学家。
