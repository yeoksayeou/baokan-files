    The Growth of Ethnic Minority Cadres in Yunnan
    By our reporter Qin Junguang
    Yunnan Province has cultivated and promoted more than 17,000 ethnic minority cadres, with those at or above the county level accounting for 15.4%. The rapid growth of ethnic minority cadres in Yunnan Province is mainly due to the care and cultivation of party organizations at all levels. Lijiang Prefecture, under its jurisdiction, has cultivated more than 930 ethnic minority cadres in its seven counties, accounting for 40.33% of the total number of cadres in the seven counties. The Yunnan Provincial Trade System has also cultivated and promoted more than 40% of ethnic minority cadres in its border regions.
    In cultivating and promoting ethnic minority cadres, party organizations at all levels in Yunnan Province, in accordance with the spirit of "boldly letting go" put forward by the Central Committee, have promoted some outstanding cadres with both ability and integrity without sticking to conventional procedures. Xu Wen'an, vice chairman of the Honghe Hani Autonomous Region, is one such example of a cadre who was promoted by the Party without sticking to conventional procedures. Before liberation, he was a person who suffered greatly. Under the care of the Party, he has lived in ethnic minority colleges, visited Beijing and many other places in recent years; the Party cultivated and promoted him from an ordinary person to the position of township head, deputy district head, and directly from deputy district head to the leading position of vice chairman of the autonomous region.
    Another reason for the rapid growth of ethnic minority cadres is the establishment of fraternal and close relationships with Han cadres from outside, which enables them to improve through mutual learning and mutual assistance. Han cadres from outside help ethnic minority cadres learn culture, policies, working methods, and Chinese; ethnic minority cadres help outside cadres become familiar with local conditions, customs, and teach outside cadres to learn the languages of their ethnic groups. For example, more than 90% of the outside district and township cadres working in the Lisu ethnic group's area of Nujiang have learned the Lisu language.
    However, at present, the work of cultivating and promoting ethnic minority cadres, both in terms of quantity and quality, cannot keep up with the needs of the ever-developing work. Some areas still do not have their own ethnic minority cadres, such as the Yao people in Wenshan Prefecture, who are very eager to have their own ethnic minority cadres. In the cultivation and promotion of ethnic minority cadres, there are still a few Han leading cadres who underestimate the ability and role of ethnic minority cadres, and do not actively cultivate and promote them. Some individual Han cadres even compare their qualifications and abilities with those of ethnic minority cadres, are dissatisfied with them, and take over the work of ethnic minority cadres. Therefore, at the First Congress of the Communist Party of China Yunnan Provincial Committee held in late June, it was proposed to continue to criticize the remnants of Han chauvinism among Han cadres, actively cultivate and promote ethnic minority cadres, so as to adapt to the ever-developing work needs of the ethnic minority areas.

    云南民族干部的成长
    本报记者　秦军光
    云南省已经培养、提拔了一万七千多个民族干部，其中县级以上的领导干部就占15.4％。云南省的民族干部能够这样迅速成长，主要是由于各级党组织的关心和培养。丽江专区所属的七个县培养了九百三十多个民族干部，占七县干部总数的40.33％；云南省贸易系统在边疆各地也培养提拔了占干部总数的40％以上的民族干部。
    在培养和提拔民族干部的时候，云南省的各级党组织按照中央提出的“大胆放手”的精神，破格地提拔了一些德才兼备的优秀干部。红河哈尼族自治区副主席许文安就是被党破格提拔的一个。解放前他是一个受苦人。在党的关怀下，几年来他住过民族学院，到过北京和其他许多地方参观；党把他由一个普通人培养提拔成乡长、副区长，由副区长一下提拔到自治区副主席的领导岗位上。
    民族干部迅速成长的另一个原因，是同外来的汉族干部建立了兄弟般的亲密关系，因而能够在互相学习、互相帮助中得到提高。外来干部帮助少数民族干部学习文化、政策以及工作方法和汉语；少数民族干部帮助外来干部熟习地区情况、风俗人情以及教外来干部学习本民族语言。如在怒江的傈僳族聚居区工作的外来的区乡干部，已有90％以上的人学会了傈僳族话。
    但是，目前在培养提拔少数民族干部的工作中，无论在数量和质量上都赶不上工作日益发展的需要，有些地区的少数民族至今还没有他们自己的民族干部，像文山专区的瑶族人民就非常渴望有自己的民族干部。在培养提拔民族干部中，仍有少数汉族领导干部低估民族干部的能力和作用，而不积极培养提拔，甚至个别的汉族干部还有同民族干部比资格、比能力、不服气和包办代替民族干部的工作等现象。因此，在六月下旬召开的中共云南省第一次党代表大会上，提出要继续批判汉族干部中的大民族主义思想残余，积极培养和提拔民族干部，以适应各民族地区日益发展着的工作需要。
