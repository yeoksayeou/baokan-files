    “What the 'Master' Says is Always Right”
    Bing Cheng
    In the play "Fifteen Strings of Cash," Lou Ashu says: "If the master says it's adultery and murder, then it must be adultery and murder." This, of course, shows Lou Ashu's guilt and his attempt to absolve himself of responsibility, but the format of this sentence is worth studying, because this format represents a way of thinking.
    What the master says is always right. Why is it always right? Because it is the master who is speaking. You might as well listen: if the master says it is like this, then naturally it is like this, his tone is so decisive. The entire essence of Lou Ashu's way of thinking is like this.
    Is it just Lou Ashu? In the past, many people started with "The sages have said" or began with "Confucius said" or "Mencius said," laying out the major premise and then establishing an argument and making a judgment. In recent decades, "The sages have said" and "Confucius said" and "Mencius said" have almost disappeared, but before the major premise there is often "So-and-so said" or "So-and-so instructed us," showing that the remaining influence has not waned. Why can these major premises be major premises? Usually there is no need for proof; implicitly there is the following meaning—what So-and-so says is qualified to be a major premise. This is almost the same as Lou Ashu. Doesn't Lou Ashu believe that what the master says is always right? Therefore, Lou Ashu's way of thinking can be representative.
    In earlier years, there was a name called "idol worship"; this year there is a new name called "cult of personality." The two names are essentially the same, both referring to this kind of thinking.
    The words of the sages, Confucius, Mencius, and this So-and-so, that So-and-so, which are used as major premises, may all be correct, the conclusions drawn from these major premises may all be reasonable, and they may indeed be beneficial to practical work, but such a way of thinking is always hard to convince people, because it only recognizes So-and-so and does not distinguish between right and wrong, because it unconditionally affirms that what So-and-so says must be reasonable. Unconditionally affirming that what So-and-so says must be reasonable will never become a convention.
    Getting rid of this way of thinking should be one of the ways to improve writing style.

    “老爷”说的准没错
    秉丞
    “十五贯”里的娄阿鼠说：“老爷说是通奸谋杀，自然是通奸谋杀的了。”这当然表现娄阿鼠作恶心虚，谋脱干系，可是这句话的格式可以研究一下，因为这个格式代表一种思想方法。
    老爷说的话准没有错儿。为什么准没有错儿？就因为说话的是老爷。不妨听一听，老爷说是怎么样，自然是怎么样了，他的语气多么斩钉截铁。娄阿鼠的思想方法的全部精华就是这样。
    岂但娄阿鼠呢？从前有许多人用“先圣有言”发端，或者用“孔子曰”“孟子曰”开场，把大前提摆出来，然后立论下判断。近几十年来，“先圣有言”和“孔子曰”“孟子曰”几乎绝迹了，可是大前提的前边往往是“某某说”或者“某某指示我们”，可见余风未衰。这些大前提为什么能做大前提，照例用不着证明，这里头隐隐含着这么个意思——是某某说的话就有资格做大前提。这就差不多跟娄阿鼠一鼻孔出气了。娄阿鼠不是相信老爷说的话准没有错儿吗？所以娄阿鼠的思想方法可以做代表。
    早些年有个名儿叫“偶像崇拜”，今年有个新鲜名儿叫“个人崇拜”，两个名儿二而一，都指的这一种思想方法。
    被用作大前提的先圣，孔子、孟子以及这个某某，那个某某的话也许全没有错儿，从这些大前提推出来的结论也许全有道理，也许对实际工作确有好处，可是这样的思想方法总难叫人信服，因为它只认某某而不辨道理，因为它无条件地肯定某某的话必有道理。无条件地肯定某某的话必有道理，这是无论如何不会约定俗成的。
    摆脱这样的思想方法，该是改进文风的办法之一。
