    A Group of Scientists Gather to Study Prevention of Potato Late Blight
    (Our newspaper dispatch) A group of potato late blight researchers from the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing Agricultural University, and Hebei Province, Shanxi Province, and Inner Mongolia held a symposium in Shalingzi on July 3 to study joint experimental work. Based on the fact that central diseased plants of late blight have already appeared in Xuanhua, Wanquan, and other counties, and that many regions are experiencing particularly humid weather, the symposium believes that this disease is a serious threat to potato production in northern North China this year. If prevention is not stepped up, it may cause huge losses. Therefore, it is recommended that all grassroots agricultural production units take measures to prevent it.
    The symposium believes that the main measures at present are to immediately start checking for central diseased plants, and in conjunction with the inspection, spray copper sulfate solution on the central diseased plants and the plants around them. Secondly, in combination with hoeing and weeding, earthing up to form ridges as early as possible. This measure can effectively delay the above-ground spread of late blight and reduce tuber rot caused by underground infection. (Lin Chuangguang, Huang He)

    一批科学工作者集会研究预防马铃薯晚疫病
    本报讯　中国科学院、北京农业大学和河北省、山西省、内蒙古的一批马铃薯晚疫病研究工作者七月三日在沙岭子举行座谈会，研究联合试验工作。座谈会根据晚疫病中心病株已经在宣化、万全等县出现的事实和许多地区出现特殊潮湿气候的情况，认为这一病害是今年华北北部马铃薯生产的严重威胁，如果不加紧预防，就可能造成巨大损失，因此建议各基层农业生产单位采取措施加以预防。
    座谈会认为，当前的主要措施是立即开始中心病株的检查，结合检查对已发现的中心病株及其周围的植株喷洒硫酸铜溶液。其次，结合中耕除草，及早培土成垅，这种措施可以有效地延缓晚疫病的地上蔓延和减少因地下侵染所致的块茎腐烂。　（林传光、黄　河）
