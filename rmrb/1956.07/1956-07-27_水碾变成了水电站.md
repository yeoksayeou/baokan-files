Xinhua News Agency, Kunming Electric Dispatch: The first rural small-scale hydroelectric power station in Yunnan Province has started transmitting electricity in mid-July.

This hydroelectric power station was built by the Gucheng and Chijiang agricultural cooperatives in Yiliang County, using an original water mill. Some of the materials for the water turbine are wood. The generator is a repaired old machine, using the hydropower of the Nanpan River to drive the generator.

Now the agricultural cooperative uses the electricity transmitted by the hydroelectric power station to power rice mills, reducing physical labor. The local troops of the Chinese People's Liberation Army also gratuitously helped more than 600 cooperative members install electric lights.

    水碾变成了水电站
    新华社昆明电　云南省第一座农村小型水力发电站，已经在七月中旬开始送电。
    这座水电站是宜良县古城和赤江两个农业社，利用原有的一座水碾兴建起来的。水轮机的材料有一部分是木料。发电机是修理好的旧机器，利用南盘江的水力带动发电。
    现在农业社利用水电站输送的电流带动碾米机碾米，减轻了体力劳动。中国人民解放军驻当地部队，还无偿地帮助农业社的六百多户社员安装了电灯。
