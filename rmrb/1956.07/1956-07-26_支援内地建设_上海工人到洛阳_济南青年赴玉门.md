　　Supporting Inland Construction
　　Shanghai Workers to Luoyang
　　Jinan Youth to Yumen
　　(Our Shanghai Dispatch) On July 23rd, over thirty metalworking technicians from Shanghai went to Luoyang to participate in the work of the First Tractor Manufacturing Plant. These are the first group of workers from Shanghai transferred to the tractor manufacturing plant to directly participate in production. These technicians all possess skills of level four or above; among them are veteran technicians with skills of level six or seven. They were originally employed workers in various factories in Shanghai, and after registering to participate in key construction projects last year, they were approved to participate in the work of the tractor manufacturing plant. They have undergone more than a year of training in over a dozen factories in Shanghai, and their technical skills have improved.
　　Currently, twenty-four state-owned and joint state-private heavy industrial factories in Shanghai are accelerating the training of over four hundred metalworking technicians for the First Tractor Manufacturing Plant. Most of these technicians will be dispatched to Luoyang in batches this year to participate in the manufacturing of tractors.
　　(Our Jinan Dispatch, July 25th) The fourth group of one hundred and two Shandong youths supporting the Yumen Oilfield left Jinan by train on the evening of July 13th. Relatives, classmates, and friends who came to the station to see them off waved goodbye with admiration. Liu Jirui and his wife from Jinan City had prepared personal belongings for their only daughter, Liu Guirong, a few days ago, and now they personally came to the station to see her off. They said: Although she is only sixteen years old and is going thousands of miles away from home, we are very relieved because the country will take even better care of her than her own parents. Qin Shulan and Lin Yu, two young girls who had just graduated from middle school, had never met before, but at the station, they became close friends in an instant. Qin Shulan said to Lin Yu's sister: In the big family of the motherland, the two of us are like sisters. When we get to our jobs, she will help me, and I will help her, and we will make progress together, and we must not let down the motherland's hopes for us.
　　This group of young people supporting the Yumen Oilfield are all graduates of junior middle school and senior primary school from last year and this year, including fifty-nine men and forty-three women. Prior to this, from June 22nd to July 6th, three batches of three hundred and sixty-nine young men and women from Shandong with senior primary and junior middle school education had successively gone to the Yumen Oilfield. After arriving at their destination, after a short period of study, some served as trainees in administrative management, some studied technology, and some served as workers in geological exploration, and they were all very enthusiastic about their work.

    济南青年赴玉门
    本报上海讯　七月二十三日上海市有三十多名五金技术工人去洛阳参加第一拖拉机制造厂工作。这是上海市第一批调往拖拉机制造厂直接参加生产的工人。这些技工都具有四级以上的技术；其中还有六、七级技术的老技工。他们原来都是上海市各工厂的在职工人，在去年报名参加重点建设后被批准参加拖拉机制造厂工作的。他们曾经在上海市十多个工厂中进行了一年多的学习，技术水平都有了提高。
    目前，上海市二十四个国营、公私合营重工业工厂，正在加快速度为第一拖拉机制造厂培训四百多名五金技术工人。这些技工大部分将在今年内陆续分批去洛阳参加制造拖拉机的工作。
    本报济南25日电　支援玉门油矿的第四批一百零二名山东青年，在七月十三日晚上乘车离开济南。到车站欢送的亲属、同学和朋友，都以敬佩的心情，和他们招手告别。济南市刘吉瑞夫妇，几天前就为自己的独生女儿刘桂荣准备好了随身用品，现在又亲自到车站送行，他们说：虽然她才十六岁，离家几千里，但是我们很放心，因为国家会比亲生父母照顾得还要周到。秦淑兰和林钰这两个刚从中学毕业的小姑娘，过去根本没见过面，在车站上的一瞬间，竟结成亲密的朋友了。秦淑兰向林钰的姐姐说：在祖国的大家庭里，我们俩就是亲姊妹，到工作岗位上，一定她帮助我，我帮助她，共同进步，绝对不能辜负祖国对我们的希望。
    这批支援玉门油矿的青年，都是去年和今年的初中和高小毕业生，其中有男的五十九人，女的四十三人。在这以前，从六月二十二日到七月六日，山东已经有三百六十九名高小、初中程度的男女青年，分三批先后去玉门油矿。他们到达目的地后，经过短期学习，有的担任行政管理方面的练习生，有的学习技术，还有的担任地质勘察方面的工人，工作热情都很高。
