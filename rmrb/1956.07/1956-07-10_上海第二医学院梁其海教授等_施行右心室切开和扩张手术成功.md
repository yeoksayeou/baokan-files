    Shanghai Second Medical College Professor Liang Qihai and doctors Wang Yishan, Ye Chunxiu, Huang Dingkun, and others have successfully performed a complex heart surgery - right ventriculotomy and dilation surgery. This is the first time this has been done in our country.
    Right ventriculotomy and dilation surgery is the newest and most effective surgical treatment for congenital pulmonary artery stenosis. This method involves cutting open the right ventricle of the patient's heart, using a special surgical knife to cut open the stenotic pulmonary artery valve, and then using a dilator to enlarge the narrowed part of the pulmonary artery, before sewing the right ventricle back up.
    Congenital pulmonary artery stenosis has long been considered an incurable disease. Due to the stenosis of the patient's pulmonary artery, the blood supply to the lungs is insufficient, and the patient will experience extreme shortness of breath and heart palpitations even with slight activity. The patient with congenital pulmonary artery stenosis who underwent right ventriculotomy and dilation surgery this time was Shen Xingyun, a female worker from Shanghai Huafeng Textile Factory. In the past, she often experienced shortness of breath, heart palpitations, nausea, and fainting at work due to her illness, and was often rushed to the hospital for emergency treatment due to fainting. Now, after Professor Liang Qihai and others performed the surgery, the patient was able to get out of bed and move around in four days, and the symptoms have been completely cured. She was recently discharged from the hospital to recuperate at home and will soon be able to return to work.

    施行右心室切开和扩张手术成功
    本报讯　一种复杂的心脏手术——右心室切开和扩张手术，已由上海第二医学院梁其海教授及王一山、叶椿秀、黄定坤等医师施行成功，这在我国还是第一次。
    右心室切开和扩张手术，是一种医治先天性肺动脉狭窄症最新的和有效的外科治疗方法。这种方法是切开病人心脏的右心室，用特制的手术刀把肺动脉狭窄瓣膜切开，再用扩张器把肺动脉狭窄的部分扩大，然后把右心室缝起来。
    先天性肺动脉狭窄症，长期以来是一种不治之症。由于病人肺动脉狭窄，对肺部的血液供应不足，病人稍一活动，就会引起极度气急，心狂跳。这次接受右心室切开扩张手术的先天性肺动脉狭窄症患者是上海华丰和织造厂的女工沈杏云。过去，她因病经常在工作中气急，心跳、恶心、昏厥，并且常常由于昏厥送医院急救。现经梁其海教授等施行手术后，病人四天即起床活动，病症已全部痊愈，并于最近出院回家疗养，不久即可恢复工作。
