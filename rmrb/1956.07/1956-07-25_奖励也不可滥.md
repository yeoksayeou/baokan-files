Title: Rewards Should Not Be Abused Either

　　In Yishan, Guangxi Province, many agricultural production cooperatives have implemented a labor over-quota reward system during busy farming seasons or when encountering urgent production tasks. This method has played a significant role in improving labor productivity. However, some agricultural cooperatives have developed some biases when implementing this method.

　　Some places have excessively high requirements for attendance rate, demanding continuous over-quota work for many days without leaving time for members to manage household affairs; or regardless of whether they are male or female members, regardless of the amount of housework, they are all required to work full workdays. This makes the productive labor of some members excessively tense. As a result, while the community's production has been developed, the members' household sideline occupations have been lost. Because the Luoyan Agricultural Cooperative in Yishan County has been emphasizing going out early and returning late every day for the past two or three months, household sideline occupations are generally not as good as last year. The twenty-four households in Gaolou Village of this cooperative raised fourteen fewer pigs than in the same period last year, a decrease of 32%. Because they didn't have time to manage their private plots, no household could be self-sufficient in vegetables.

　　In order to encourage members to work actively, some agricultural cooperative cadres have set too many reward methods. An agricultural cooperative in Liucheng County stipulated during the rush planting season that planting one handful of seedlings after work would be counted as three handfuls; in addition, the specifications for each handful of seedlings were not strict, and one member earned ninety-six work points in one day. Excessive and unprincipled rewards not only increased the burden on the entire community, but also cultivated incorrect labor views among members. It should be understood that labor and seizing the season are the obligations of members, and the reward part can only be equivalent to a small part of the labor income, and should never exceed the labor income. Excessive rewards violate the principle of distribution according to labor and will affect reasonable distribution.

　　In addition, the incomplete reward system is also not conducive to production. In order to complete the task of rush planting, some cooperatives only rewarded rice planting; members rushed to plant rice, and no one was willing to do other work. Therefore, while rewarding a certain type of work, corresponding rewards for other types of work should be stipulated accordingly.

　　A poorly defined or poorly executed punishment system will dampen the enthusiasm of members; a poorly defined or poorly executed reward system will also have a bad effect. Rewards and punishments are necessary and powerful weapons for running cooperatives well. However, one must not be superstitious about this weapon, let alone abuse it. How can we correctly and appropriately formulate and implement reward and punishment systems? It is best to consult with the members of the community more!

### 奖励也不可滥

    奖励也不可滥
    张云钊
    广西省宜山一带很多农业生产合作社，在农忙或遇到突击性生产任务的时候，大都实行了劳动超额奖励制。这种办法实行以后，对提高劳动生产率起了很大作用。但是，有些农业社在实行这种办法的时候也产生了一些偏向。
    有些地方对出工率要求过高，要求多日连续不断超额，没留出社员料理家务的时间；或者不分男女社员，不管家务多少，一律要求出满工。这使一些社员生产劳动过分紧张。结果，社的生产虽然搞了，社员的家庭副业却丢了。宜山县洛岩农业社因为两三个月来天天强调早出迟归，家庭副业普遍不如去年。这个社高楼屯的二十四户，家庭养猪比去年同期少了十四头，减少32％。因为没时间料理自留地，没有一户蔬菜能够自给。
    部分农业社干部为了鼓励社员积极劳动，把奖励办法定得过多。柳城县一个农业社在抢插时规定：收工后继续插秧的，插一把按三把记分；加以每把秧的规格不严，有一个社员一天得了九十六个工分。过多的无原则的奖励，不仅增加了全社的负担，也养成了社员不正确的劳动观点。应当了解，劳动和抢季节都是社员的义务，奖励部分只能相当于劳动所得的一小部分，绝不应该超过劳动所得。奖励过多就违反了按劳取酬的原则，就会影响合理分配。
    此外，奖励制度订得不全面，也不利于生产。有的社为了完成抢插任务，单独对插秧进行奖励；社员便抢着插秧，别的工作没人肯做。因此，在对某一工种进行奖励的同时，应该相应地规定对别的工种的奖励。
    惩罚制度规定得不好，或者执行得不好，会打击社员的积极性；奖励制度规定得不好或者执行得不好，同样会起不好的作用。奖惩是必要的，是办好合作社的有力的武器。可是，既不可迷信这种武器，更不可滥用这种武器。怎样才能正确地适当地规定和执行奖惩制度呢？最好还是多同社员群众商量商量吧！
