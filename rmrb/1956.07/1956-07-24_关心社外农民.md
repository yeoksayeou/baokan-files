Concern for Farmers Outside the Cooperative
Li Wangxian

    After Changzhi area of Shanxi province achieved advanced cooperativization, there were still 1,304 individual farmers, accounting for 0.16% of the total number of farmers in the area. These households were mostly rich peasants and isolated households living in extremely scattered areas. They have varying degrees of difficulty in production or life and are in great need of assistance from agricultural producers' cooperatives. However, some cooperatives not only do not help these individual farmers, but also exclude them and even arbitrarily infringe upon their interests. The Nanzhai Cooperative in Lu'an County, in the name of unified land planning and facilitating cultivation, transferred twelve mu of land from a middle peasant's household into the cooperative, exchanging it for some remote land in the high mountains. The Sangdong Cooperative took four mu of paddy field from individual farmer Li Guiyuan and allocated him six mu of mountain land. These farmers were naturally very dissatisfied with the cooperatives.

    Some cooperative cadres dislike the trouble of dealing with individual farmers, or mistakenly believe that individual farmers who do not join the cooperative are undermining the cooperativization movement. Therefore, they dare to refuse even those who want to join the cooperative. Some individual farmers reflect: "A single strand of silk cannot make a thread, and a single tree cannot make a forest. We can't join the cooperative, and there are so many difficulties. It's really a dilemma." Some individual farmers are forced to find someone to share a plow for farming seven or eight li away.

    After discovering this problem, the Changzhi Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China immediately instructed all counties to correct the behavior of agricultural cooperatives in excluding individual farmers, and to adopt an attitude of unity and assistance towards individual farmers. Cooperatives should immediately absorb individual farmers who are willing to join the cooperative and must not refuse them. Cooperatives should take the initiative to make self-criticism to those who have been excluded by the cooperatives. Cooperatives should help those who are temporarily unwilling to join the cooperative to improve their production (such as lending them farm tools, sharing plows with them, etc.). In dealing with economic issues related to individual farmers, cooperatives must adhere to the principle of mutual benefit and must not let individual farmers suffer losses.

    The more farmers who participate in agricultural producers' cooperatives, the easier it is for the minority of farmers outside the cooperative to be overlooked or discriminated against. This is something that rural Party organizations and the vast number of rural workers in various regions should pay constant attention to. What is the attitude of watching farmers outside the cooperative struggle with difficulties without helping them to overcome them? Who gave the right to refuse to accept farmers outside the cooperative who ask to join? Quickly correct those erroneous thoughts and practices. Our motto is to serve the masses, and these few farmers outside the cooperative are also the objects of our service! Unite farmers outside the cooperative, help farmers outside the cooperative, and gradually guide them onto the socialist road of common prosperity.

    关心社外农民
    李旺先
    山西省长治地区实现高级合作化以后，还有1，304户个体农民，占全区总农户的0.16％。这些户大都是富裕农民和居住极为分散的孤庄独户。他们在生产或生活上都有不同程度的困难，极需要农业生产合作社加以帮助。可是，有的合作社对这些个体农民不但不进行帮助，反而排斥他们，甚至任意侵犯他们的利益。潞安县南寨合作社以统一规划土地、便利耕作为名，把一户中农的十二亩地划到社内，调换给他一些高山远地。桑栋合作社把个体农民李贵元的四亩水地拿来，拨给他六亩山地。这些农民对合作社当然很不满意。
    有些合作社的干部嫌个体农民麻烦，或者错误地认为个体农民不入社，是破坏合作化运动，因此，有的人要求入社，他们竟敢拒绝。有些个体农民反映：单丝不成线，孤树不成林，入社入不了，困难非常多，真是进退两难。有些个体农民，被迫到七、八里以外找人合犋种地。
    中共长治地委发现这个问题以后，立即指示各县纠正农业合作社排斥个体农民的行为；对个体农民采取团结和帮助的态度。个体农民愿意入社的，合作社应立即吸收，不得拒绝，曾经受到合作社排斥的，合作社应该主动向他们作检讨；暂时还不愿入社的，合作社应该帮助他们搞好生产（如借给他们农具、和他们合犋等）。合作社在处理和个体农民有关的经济问题上，必须根据互利原则，不能使个体农民吃亏。
    参加农业生产合作社的农民越多，少数社外农民越容易被忽视或歧视。这一点，是各地农村党组织和广大农村工作人员要经常注意的。看着社外农民有困难而不帮助他们克服，这是什么态度？社外农民要求入社而拒绝接纳，谁给的这种权利？快把那些错误的思想、作法纠正过来，我们的格言是为群众服务，这少数社外农民，同样是我们服务的对象呵！团结社外农民，帮助社外农民，逐步引导他们走上共同富裕的社会主义道路。
