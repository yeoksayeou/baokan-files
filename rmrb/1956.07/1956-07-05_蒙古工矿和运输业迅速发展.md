Xinhua News Agency dispatch from TASS: The Mongolian People's Republic, once a backward pastoral country, is now victoriously developing its own industry.

In the past fifteen years, the total output of Mongolian industrial enterprises has more than tripled. Coal mining is now about twice what it was in 1940, and electricity generation has increased about threefold.

The republic is building about twenty industrial enterprises.

By the end of the Second Five-Year Plan in 1957, the level of Mongolia's industrial production will have increased by 46% compared to 1952. During this five-year plan, the state's investment in industry will be approximately 6.6 times that of the First Five-Year Plan.

Xinhua News Agency, Ulaanbaatar, July 2nd, TASS dispatch: Thirty-five years ago, Mongolia's only means of transportation was livestock. Now, the Mongolian People's Republic has various modern means of transport. The Soviet Union has provided much assistance in the development of modern transportation in Mongolia.

Every province in Mongolia now has motor vehicle depots, equipped with all the necessary equipment and experienced drivers. In 1955, the total number of vehicles in the republic more than doubled compared to 1947, and freight volume increased by 2.6 times.

Railway transport in Mongolia has also developed smoothly. A trunk line now runs from south to north, connecting the three fraternal countries of the Soviet Union, Mongolia, and China. This railway line has invigorated the eastern regions of the Gobi Desert, where well-constructed cities and villages have emerged, with schools, hospitals, and shops. Passenger and freight traffic on this line are now substantial, with transport volumes increasing month by month. There are other railway lines operating in Mongolia that are of considerable importance to the country.

Mongolia's air transport has also developed. There are air routes from Mongolia to the Soviet Union and China, as well as air routes from the capital Ulaanbaatar to various parts of the country.

During the Second Five-Year Plan (1953-1957), the freight volume of the Mongolian People's Republic will increase by 25% to 30% compared to 1953. Passenger traffic is expected to increase by about 60%.

    蒙古工矿和运输业迅速发展
    新华社据塔斯社讯　蒙古人民共和国过去是一个落后的畜牧国家，现在正在胜利地发展本国工业。
    在最近十五年来，蒙古工业企业的生产总量增加为三倍以上。现在这里的采煤量约为1940年的两倍，发电量已经增加为三倍左右。
    共和国正在建设约二十个工业企业。
    在1957年第二个五年计划结束的时候，蒙古工业生产的水平将比1952年增加46％。在这个五年计划期间，国家对工业的投资将约为第一个五年计划期间的六点六倍。
