    Xinhua News Agency, July 7th: A Chiang Kai-shek bomber, while intruding into the airspace over the Shangrao area of Jiangxi Province at 1:06 AM on June 23rd, was shot down by Chinese People's Liberation Army Air Force planes and crashed into a mountain gully within Guangfeng County, Jiangxi Province.

    It has been confirmed that this downed Chiang aircraft belonged to the "Intelligence Department of the Air Force Headquarters" of the Chiang Kai-shek army, and the model was an American-made B-17G four-engine bomber.

After several days, the bodies of eight Chiang Kai-shek Air Force personnel who had been killed in the crash were found. Identification found on the bodies revealed the names of five of them: Ye Zhengmin, Major of the 35th Squadron of the Eighth Brigade of the Chiang Kai-shek Air Force; Gao Pengfei, Third-Class First-Grade Mechanic; Hao Shuqin, First-Class Superior Mechanic; Chen Liren, First-Class Superior Mechanic; and Dong Fanmin, whose rank is unknown.
