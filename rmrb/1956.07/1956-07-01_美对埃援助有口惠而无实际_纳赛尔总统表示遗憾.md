Xinhua News Agency, 28th - According to an Associated Press report from Cairo on the 27th: Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser complained that the United States only offers lip service and no actual help to Egypt. He said, "I am very sorry, because I originally hoped to deal with the United States. ... But the United States has left me with no other choice."

He made these remarks to Alicia Patterson, editor and publisher of the New York State "Newsday," who is currently in the Middle East for interviews. He said, "Egypt is unwilling to be a pawn of any country. Egypt must remain free in order to build its own country economically and politically. If I enter into an alliance with outsiders, then the people here will not allow me to continue as their leader."

He continued, "To unify, we must also be strong. The 1948 war with Israel proves this. I first went to the United States to ask for assistance. I asked Under Secretary of Defense William Foster for arms. He said it was possible. I waited, but nothing happened. So I again asked your government for arms. I am not asking for them for free; Egypt is willing to pay. Promises were made, discussions were held, but still no arms."

When Patterson asked whether Egypt would accept the Soviet proposal to help Egypt build the Aswan High Dam, the president said, "Since February, I have been waiting to hear whether Britain and the United States will lend us money through the World Bank to build this dam. Still no news. This dam is very important to our economy. It will provide us with the necessary electricity, and it will irrigate more than two million acres of desert. The West has abandoned us. Russia has not."

Abdel Nasser stated that he himself is against communism. He said, "I have fought against communism in my country, and I have put communists in prison. All I care about is eliminating communism and unifying this country." He also said, "It is true that Shepilov received a warm welcome when he came here to attend our liberation celebrations. However, this welcome was purely out of gratitude for their making us stronger. It has no other meaning."

    美对埃援助有口惠而无实际
    纳赛尔总统表示遗憾
    据新华社28日讯　据美联社开罗二十七日消息：埃及新总统阿卜杜勒·纳赛尔抱怨美国对埃及只有口惠而没有实际的帮助。他说：“我很遗憾，因为我本来是希望同美国打交道的。……可是美国使得我没有别的路可走了。”
    他对正在中东采访的纽约州“新闻晚报”主笔兼发行人阿利西亚·派特逊发表谈话说：“埃及不愿意作任何国家的小卒，埃及必须保持自由，以便在经济和政治两方面建设自己的国家。如果我同外人订立了盟约，那末这里的人民就不会让我继续作他们的领导人。”
    他接着说，“要统一也就必须强盛。1948年的以色列战争证明这一点。我先跑到美国去要求援助。我向国防部副部长威廉·福斯特要求军火。他说可以。我等待着，可是毫无动静。于是我再次要求你们政府给我军火。我并不要求白送，埃及愿意出钱。诺言是有的，谈论是有的，只是仍然没有军火。”
    当派特逊问到埃及会不会接受苏联所提出的关于帮助埃及在阿斯旺建筑大水坝的建议的时候，这位总统说：“自从二月以来，我就在等待，希望听到英国和美国会不会通过世界银行借钱给我们修建这个水坝。仍然没有消息。这个水坝对于我们的经济是十分重要的。它们会使我们获得必要的电力，它也会使二百多万英亩的沙漠获得灌溉。西方丢弃了我们。俄国却没有。”
    阿卜杜勒·纳赛尔表示他自己是反对共产主义的。他说：“我曾经同国内的共产主义进行斗争，我把共产党人关进了监牢。我所关心的只是清除共产主义并且统一这个国家。”他又说，“谢皮洛夫到这里参加我们的解放庆祝典礼的时候，受到了热烈的欢呼，这是事实。可是，这样欢迎他纯粹是由于感激他们使我们强大起来。并没有别的意义。”
