    Advanced Thinking Wins
    Cotton Grows Well in the Youth Planting Group of Qianfeng Cooperative, Shehong County
    (Our Dispatch) The three mu and eight fen of cotton cultivated by the youth planting group of the second district team of the Qianfeng Agricultural Production Cooperative in Shehong County, Sichuan, is growing well and has begun to produce bolls in large quantities. This is due to the adoption of advanced techniques such as square-grid seedling cultivation, early planting, and dense planting (8,000 plants per mu), as well as reasonable fertilization, timely pest control, and meticulous pruning. This youth planting group has been rated as an advanced production group.
    Initially, some conservative old cooperative members shook their heads and said, "If cotton is planted so densely, what cotton will be harvested! It's simply letting these kids play around with a few mu of land." Now, the irrefutable facts have shattered their conservative thinking, and they are all saying, "Accepting advanced technology is really good. We used to be afraid that dense cotton would reduce production, but seeing their cotton has given us a boost of confidence."

    先进的思想胜利了
    射洪县前锋社青年种植小组的棉花长得好
    本报讯　四川射洪县前锋农业生产合作社第二区队的青年种植小组栽培的三亩八分棉花，由于采用了方格育苗、早栽、密植（每亩8，000株）的先进技术，并且合理施肥，及时治虫，细致整枝，目前棉株生长良好，开始大批结桃。这个青年种植小组已被评为先进生产组。
    开初，个别思想保守的老社员摇着头说：“棉花种得那么密，能收到啥棉花！简直拿几亩地给他们娃娃闹着玩。”现在，铁的事实打破了他们的保守思想，都说：“接受先进技术硬是好，早先我们都怕棉花密了要减产，这下看了他们的棉花，才给我们打了个定心锤。”
