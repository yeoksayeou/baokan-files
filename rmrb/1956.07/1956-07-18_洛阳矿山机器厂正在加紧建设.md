Xinhua News Agency, Luoyang, 17th - The construction of a factory for manufacturing coal mining machinery and equipment - the Luoyang Mining Machinery Plant - is being accelerated.

The Luoyang Mining Machinery Plant is China's first most modern large-scale mining machinery manufacturing plant. It has eight production workshops, and the entire production process is highly mechanized. According to the current plan, after the completion of this factory, it will produce three categories of twenty-six types of machines for drilling, hoisting, and coal preparation; among them are windlasses weighing up to 108 tons and highly efficient drilling machines.

Preparations for the Luoyang Mining Machinery Plant began as early as 1954. At present, the factory's dormitory project has been basically completed; the external construction of the ten permanent railways in the factory area and the three main workshops for metal structures, comprehensive auxiliary facilities, and woodworking have also been completed. The remaining five main workshops will be fully under construction this year and in the first quarter of next year.

    洛阳矿山机器厂正在加紧建设
    新华社洛阳17日电　一座制造采煤机械设备的工厂——洛阳矿山机器厂，正在加紧建设中。
    洛阳矿山机器厂是我国第一座最现代化的大型矿山机械制造厂。它有八个生产车间，整个生产都是高度机械化的。按照现在的计划，这个工厂建成以后，将要生产钻探、起重、选煤方面用的三类二十六种机器；其中有体重达108吨的卷扬机和效率很高的打眼机等。
    洛阳矿山机器厂，早在1954年就进行了筹建工作。目前，这个工厂的宿舍工程已经基本完成；厂区内的十一条永久铁路和金属结构、综合辅助、木工等三个主要车间的外型建筑工程，也都完成。另外五个主要车间将在今年内和明年第一季度全部施工。这个工厂预计在明年第三季度可以进行试车生产；1958年4月份就可以全面投入生产。
