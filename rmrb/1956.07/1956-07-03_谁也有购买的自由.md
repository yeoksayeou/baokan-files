Consumers' Opinions

    Everyone Has the Freedom to Purchase
    The Old Street Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Que Mountain County, Henan Province, recently sold eighty brooms to the First Advanced Agricultural Cooperative of Gaozhuang Township. The First Agricultural Cooperative, seeing that the quality was poor and the price unfair, did not want them and went to the Zhumadian City Cooperative to buy them instead. The manager of the Old Street Supply and Marketing Cooperative therefore criticized the purchasing agent of the First Agricultural Cooperative, saying: "Your thinking is incorrect." After the preliminary distribution of profits in the summer, members of the First Agricultural Cooperative of Gaozhuang Township went to Zhumadian City to buy a batch of daily necessities. The manager of the Old Street Supply and Marketing Cooperative, upon learning this, actually criticized the leaders of the First Advanced Cooperative for "casually establishing connections" and "affecting the currency recall task of the Old Street Supply and Marketing Cooperative."
    Now, the members of the First Agricultural Cooperative of Gaozhuang Township want to ask: since the goods of the Old Street Supply and Marketing Cooperative are neither complete nor fairly priced, why must people be forced to buy their goods? Should the people's freedom to buy things with their own money be restricted?

    谁也有购买的自由
    河南省确山县老街供销合作社最近卖给高庄乡第一高级农业社八十把扫帚。第一农业社看到质量坏，价格不公道不愿要，就到驻马店市合作社买去了。老街供销社的经理因此批评第一农业社的采购员说：“你们思想不正确”。第一农业社社员在夏季预分后，到驻马店市买了一批日用品。老街供销社的经理知道后，竟批评第一高级社的领导人“随便乱挂钩”，“影响老街供销社的货币回笼任务。”
    现在高庄乡第一农业社社员要问：老街供销社的货色既不全，价格又不公道，为什么一定要别人去买他的东西？人民用自己的钱买东西是不是还要受限制？
