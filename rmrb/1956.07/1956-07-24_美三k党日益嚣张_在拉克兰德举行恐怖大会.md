Xinhua News Agency, July 23rd dispatch: Florida news: On the evening of July 21st, while black people in Lakeland, Florida were praying for human peace and harmony in a small church, a racist terrorist meeting was being held only five miles away from the church. The Ku Klux Klan leader, who presided over this terrorist gathering, announced to 250 party members dressed in white robes and white hoods beside a burning cross that was as high as twenty feet: "We white people will rule the world."

These terrorists also attracted 3,000 listeners and openly called on them to join the Ku Klux Klan. The leading party members said: "The Ku Klux Klan of our great nation has the responsibility to clearly define the black and white races in the United States" and "Black and white people are not allowed to attend the same public schools in Florida."

The Ku Klux Klan members threatened: "This is just the beginning of the Ku Klux Klan movement in Florida." They predicted that terrorist rallies of the same nature would be held in other cities in order to deal with the increasingly developing struggle of black people for rights.

    美三K党日益嚣张
    在拉克兰德举行恐怖大会
    据新华社23日讯　美国佛罗里达州消息：七月二十一日晚，当佛罗里达州拉克兰德的黑人在一个小教堂内为人类和平和协调而祷告的时候，就在离这个教堂五英里的地方却正在举行一次种族主义者的恐怖大会。主持这个恐怖集会的三K党头子在燃烧着的高达二十英尺的十字架旁向二百五十名身穿白袍头戴白罩的党徒宣布：“我们白种人将统治全世界”。
    这一批恐怖分子还招来了三千名听众，公开号召他们参加三K党。为首的党徒说：“我们这个伟大国家的三K党有责任把美国种族画清黑白”，“在佛罗里达州的公立学校中不许黑白同校”。
    三K党徒们扬言：“这一次不过是佛罗里达州三K党运动的开始”。他们预告将在其他城市举行同样性质的恐怖集会，以便对付日益开展的黑人争取权利的斗争。
