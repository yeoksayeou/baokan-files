Product Quality Review

    Which Brands of Fountain Pens Are Good, Which Brands Are Not

    ★Langqin Gold Pen★ This is a new product from Shanghai Qianghua Gold Pen Factory. The structure is novel, the nib is large and hooded, the gold plating is well polished, and the writing is smooth and fluent, more durable than ordinary gold pens. The shortcomings are that the materials used and the design are not thorough enough. Some pen cap screws are short and easily loosened, and some steel ring safety sleeves are easy to fall off.

    ★502 Folding Xinmin Fountain Pen★ This is the latest improved product from Shanghai Huafu Factory. The nib has a straight slit, the ink sac is foldable, the water absorption is greatly increased compared to before, and the water return groove of the pen feed has also been improved. It not only dispenses ink evenly but also avoids leakage or ink starvation. This fountain pen is suitable for middle school students, primary school students, workers, farmers, and those who are just learning to read and write; the price is also relatively cheap. The money for one ordinary fountain pen can buy two Xinmin fountain pens. The shortcoming is that some nibs are short, causing paper scratching.

    ★562 Golden Star Fountain Pen★ A new product from Beijing Golden Star Pen Factory. It is a high-quality fountain pen suitable for people who regularly do writing work. The nib of this pen has multiple grooves, which can prevent leakage and ink starvation. The ink absorber can also prevent thermal expansion. The nib is smooth, large, writes smoothly, and is also beautiful. The pen barrel is made of celluloid material, the style is novel, and it is made relatively meticulously, not easy to deform.

    ★Heilongjiang Gold Pen★ Produced by Qiqihar City Heilongjiang Gold Pen Factory, the quality is poor. The nib is thick, and it scratches the paper when writing. Some nib slits are still skewed, the pen shape and parts are not the right size, the spring is loose, the pen feed leaks water, and sometimes no ink comes out. Some pen barrels also have knife marks.

专栏：产品质量评介

    什么牌子的钢笔好、什么牌子的钢笔不好
    ★浪琴金笔★　这是上海强华金笔厂的新产品。结构新颖，笔尖是大包头的，镀金磨得比较好，书写流利、圆滑，比一般金笔耐用。缺点是在用料和设计上还不够周密，有的笔套螺丝短，容易松动，有的钢圈保险套容易掉。
    ★502型折叠式新民钢笔★　这是上海华孚厂最近改进的产品。笔尖开缝正直，笔胆是折叠式的，吸水量比以前大大增加，笔舌回水槽也有了改进。不仅下水均匀，并能避免漏水或不下水的现象。这种钢笔适合于中、小学生、工人、农民和初学文化的人用；价钱也比较便宜，买一枝普通钢笔的钱，可以买两枝新民钢笔。缺点是有的笔尖短，有拉纸的现象。
    ★562型金星钢笔★　北京金星笔厂的新产品，是一种高级的、质量较好的钢笔，适合于一般经常作文字工作的人使用。这种笔的笔尖是多齿槽的，能防止漏水和不下水的毛病，吸水器也能起防热涨的作用，笔尖光滑，大，书写流利，也很美观。笔杆是用赛璐珞料做的，式样新颖，做得也比较细致，不易变形。
    ★黑龙江金笔★　齐齐哈尔市黑龙江金笔厂出品，质量较差。笔尖粗，写起来拉纸，有的笔尖缝还是歪斜的，笔样和零件大小不符，弹簧松动，笔舌漏水，有时又不出水，部分笔杆还有刀痕。　马秀春
