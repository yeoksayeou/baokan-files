Xinhua News Agency, Athens, 2nd - According to TASS, Soviet Foreign Minister Shepilov left Athens on the morning of July 1st after concluding his unofficial visit to Greece.

On the evening of June 30th, at a press conference held at the Soviet Embassy in Greece, Shepilov issued a statement to journalists saying that he had frank, open, and productive talks with the Greek Prime Minister and Foreign Minister in an atmosphere of understanding and sincerity. Although the Soviet Union and Greece have some differences in their views on some international issues, there are no insurmountable obstacles to developing friendly relations and cooperative affairs between the two countries. In order to establish good relations, efforts should be made to fully utilize the common ground between the two sides, which unites the people of the Soviet Union and Greece and helps to consolidate peace.

After reiterating the Soviet Union's peaceful foreign policy, Shepilov pointed out: Enemies of Soviet-Greek friendship deliberately spread rumors that Greece was receiving some kind of threat from the north. The purpose of this lie is to sow suspicion and distrust between Greece and its northern neighbors, in order to prevent the easing of international tensions. But the lies they have fabricated have been completely refuted by the diplomatic measures that demonstrate the peaceful sincerity of the Soviet Union and Greece's other northern neighbors. He pointed out that relations between Greece and its northern neighbors have recently improved somewhat.

On the economic relations between the two countries, Shepilov pointed out that, so far, good opportunities for expanding economic ties between the Soviet Union and Greece have not been fully utilized. Shepilov said: The Soviet Union is willing to study, in good faith and selflessly, the issue of mutual cooperation in developing Greece's national economy, exchanging scientific and technical experience, and training professional personnel. At the same time, based on its general principles, the Soviet Union will not put forward any conditions to Greece that may harm its sovereignty and national dignity.

The Greek government also expressed a positive attitude towards expanding economic ties with the Soviet Union, mainly towards further developing trade relations.

Shepilov also expressed the hope of expanding mutual visits between cultural, scientific, parliamentary and other delegations between the Soviet Union and Greece to promote further mutual understanding and trust between the two countries.

Shepilov concluded by saying that the Soviet Union is working to develop friendly relations with Greece, but has absolutely no intention of causing Greece to quarrel with Western countries, as some foreign newspapers have said.

After holding the press conference, Shepilov visited the Athens City Hall at the invitation of the Mayor of Athens. On the way to the City Hall, tens of thousands of Athenian citizens enthusiastically applauded the Soviet Foreign Minister.

During the visit to the City Hall, Shepilov invited the Mayor and a delegation from the City Government to visit Moscow.

    谢皮洛夫离雅典前发表声明
    希望扩大苏希间友好合作关系
    新华社2日讯　据塔斯社雅典讯：苏联外交部长谢皮洛夫在结束对希腊的非正式访问以后，在七月一日上午离开了雅典。
    在六月三十日晚上，苏联驻希腊大使馆举行的记者招待会上，谢皮洛夫向新闻记者发表声明说，他同希腊政府首相和外交大臣在谅解和诚恳的气氛中进行了开诚布公的、有成效的会谈。虽然苏联和希腊两国在对一些国际问题的看法上有一些分歧，但是，在发展两国的友好关系和事务合作的道路上，并没有什么不可克服的障碍。为了建立良好的关系，应该致力于充分利用双方的共同点，这些共同点使苏、希两国人民联合在一起并且有助于巩固和平。
    谢皮洛夫在重申了苏联的和平外交政策以后指出：苏、希友谊的敌人故意散播谣言说，希腊从北方受到了某种威胁。这种谎言的目的是想在希腊和它的北部各邻国之间散布猜疑和不信任，以便阻止国际紧张局势的和缓。但是他们制造的谎言已经完全被那些表明苏联及希腊北部其他各邻国的和平诚意的外交措施所驳倒了。他指出，希腊和它的北部各邻国之间的关系最近已经有了某些改进。
    在两国的经济关系上，谢皮洛夫指出，到目前为止，对于扩大苏联和希腊两国之间的经济联系的良好机会还利用得不多。谢皮洛夫说：苏联愿意抱着善意和无私的态度，来研究关于在发展希腊民族经济，交流科学，技术经验和培养专业人材方面的相互合作问题。同时，根据自己总的原则，苏联不会向希腊提出可能损害它的主权和民族尊严的任何条件。
    希腊政府方面也对扩大同苏联的经济联系，主要是对进一步发展贸易关系，表示了积极的态度。
    谢皮洛夫也表示希望扩大苏、希两国文化、科学、议会和其他代表团的互相访问，以促进两国进一步的相互谅解和信任。
    谢皮洛夫最后说：苏联努力发展和希腊的友好关系，但是绝没有意思要使希腊和西方国家发生争吵，好像某些外国报纸所说的那样。
    在举行记者招待会以后，谢皮洛夫应雅典市长的邀请，访问了雅典市政府。在前往市政府的道路上，上万的雅典市民热烈鼓掌欢迎这位苏联外交部长。
    在访问市政府的时候，谢皮洛夫邀请市长和市政府代表团访问莫斯科。
