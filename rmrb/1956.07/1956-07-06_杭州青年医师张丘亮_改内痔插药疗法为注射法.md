    Hangzhou Young Doctor Zhang Qiuliang
    Changes Internal Hemorrhoid Suppository Treatment to Injection Method

    According to Xinhua News Agency, Zhang Qiuliang, a young surgeon at Hangzhou Hospital in Zhejiang, has changed the internal hemorrhoid suppository treatment to an injection method for treating early and late-stage internal hemorrhoids and mixed hemorrhoids, with very good results. From January to May of this year, out of 107 patients treated, excluding 7 patients who were lost to follow-up after the injection and whose treatment outcomes are unknown, 94 out of 100 patients have been cured. The other six patients had more hemorrhoids and needed two injections (with a two-week interval between the first and second injections), but the patients did not continue treatment.

    This method uses the main Chinese medicines from Dr. Lu Qi's internal hemorrhoid suppository treatment, such as arsenic trioxide and alum, adding physiological saline and hydrochloric acid to make a solvent, then mixing it with novocaine (anesthetic) solution, and injecting it into the hemorrhoid, causing the hemorrhoid tissue to locally wither and fall off. In general, the hemorrhoid will fall off four or five days after one injection, and at the latest, it will all fall off in eleven to fourteen days. Patients with particularly large or many hemorrhoids need a second injection.

    This treatment is suitable for early and late-stage internal hemorrhoids and mixed hemorrhoids. The treatment range is wider than the internal hemorrhoid suppository treatment, the operation is simpler, patients do not need to be hospitalized, and patients experience little pain during the injection and can continue to work as usual.

### 杭州青年医师张丘亮  改内痔插药疗法为注射法

    杭州青年医师张丘亮
    改内痔插药疗法为注射法
    据新华社讯　浙江杭州医院青年外科医师张丘亮把内痔插药疗法改为注射疗法，治疗早、晚期内痔和混合痔，效果很好。从今年一月到五月，受治的一百零七个病人，除七个病人注射后失去联系不知道治疗后果外，一百个病人中已有九十四个痊愈。其他六人痔核较多，需要注射两次（第一次到第二次注射的时间需要两个星期），但患者没有继续治疗。
    这个方法是采用陆琦医师内痔插药疗法中的砒霜、明矾等主要中药，加生理食盐水和盐酸制成溶剂，再混和奴佛卡因（麻醉剂）溶液，注射在痔核上，使痔核组织局部枯萎脱落。一般患者，在一次注射后，隔四、五天痔核就可脱落，最迟的在十一天到十四天就全部脱落。痔核特别大或多的患者则需注射第二次。
    这一疗法，适用于早、晚期内痔和混合痔，医治范围比内痔插药疗法广，操作方面简便，病人不需住院，而且注射时病人没有什么痛苦，仍可照常工作。
