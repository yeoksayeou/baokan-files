Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, July 18th. Former Kuomintang military and government personnel in Fuzhou, and KMT officers and soldiers, including Nie Zhiwei, who recently revolted and returned to the mainland of the motherland, had a cordial conversation at a tea party held by the Fujian Provincial Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang Revolutionary Committee on the afternoon of the 17th.
    After Nie Zhiwei introduced at the meeting how he overcame all difficulties and finally returned to the mainland of the motherland, the audience responded with warm applause for their patriotic and righteous deeds.
    Li Shijia asked Nie Zhiwei with concern: "What is the current situation of Huoshaodao, which I took over from the Japanese imperialists when I was the commander of the Second Fleet of the Kuomintang Navy?"
    Nie Zhiwei replied: "Huoshaodao has become a concentration camp for imprisoning so-called 'problematic' KMT officers and soldiers. When Huoshaodao is mentioned, many people turn pale with fear."
    Han Zhongying, the former Major General Director of the Machinery Department of the Kuomintang Taiwan Navy, asked about the living conditions of the Taiwanese people. Wang Jialun added: "In Taiwan, which is occupied by the United States, prices are rising sharply. There are countless extortions and levies, and several Taiwanese people have to bear the burden of supporting one military and government personnel of the Chiang Kai-shek group."
    The participants of the tea party became more and more enthusiastic as they talked. At this time, Zheng Zhenwen, the former Director of the Education Department of Fujian Province of the Kuomintang, loudly recited a seven-character quatrain poem that he and Chen Yingzhou, a former Qing Dynasty scholar, collaborated on the spot: "Embracing wood and rushing through waves to return, returning to see the motherland's good glory; Knowing many who strike the oars in the middle of the stream, suddenly turning their heads to realize the mistakes of the past." This poem aroused applause from the audience.
    The tea party lasted for five hours, and a dinner was held together afterwards.

    起义的蒋军官兵说
    苛捐杂税不胜数　台湾人民生活苦
    新华社福州18日电　在福州的前国民党军政人员和不久前起义回到祖国大陆的蒋军官兵聂智威等，十七日下午在中国国民党革命委员会福建省委员会举行的茶话会上亲切谈心。
    聂智威在会上介绍了他如何排除万难，终于回到祖国大陆的经过后，全场对他们的爱国义举报以热烈的掌声。
    李世甲关怀地向聂智威问道：“我任国民党海军第二舰队司令时，曾从日本帝国主义者手里接收过来的火烧岛近况如何？”
    聂智威回答说：“火烧岛已成为囚禁所谓有‘问题’的蒋军官兵的集中营。提起火烧岛，许多人都谈虎色变。”
    前国民党台湾海军机械处少将处长韩仲英问起台湾人民的生活情况，王家轮接上说：“在美国霸占下的台湾，物价直线上升。苛捐杂税数不胜数，几个台湾老百姓就要负担养活一个蒋介石集团的军政人员。”
    茶话会的参加者越谈越起劲。这时，前国民党福建省教育厅厅长郑贞文高声诵颂了他和前清举人陈赢洲当场合作的一首七绝诗：“抱木冲波踏浪归，归看祖国好光辉；知多击楫中流者，猛一回头识昨非。”这首诗引起了满场喝采。
    茶话会进行了五个钟头，会后在一起聚餐。
