    Let's Have Fewer Meetings!
    To the Editor:
    I am a cadre at the Lanzhou Textile Company. After reading the People's Daily editorial published on June 7th, "Let Cadres Have Fewer Meetings and Go Down to the Grassroots More," I feel that the situation of having too many concurrent posts and too many meetings is very serious in the commercial departments of Lanzhou, and in our company as well.

    I am a Communist Party member and a member of the Communist Youth League. I do political work in the company, holding twelve positions concurrently, including Secretary of the Youth League Branch, Organization Member of the Youth League General Branch, and Propaganda Officer of the Trade Union. My health is not good, and attending meetings is indeed a great burden for me.

    Once, after attending several meetings in a row in the morning, the Party branch notified me that there would be a Youth League branch meeting at noon. I suggested that the meeting be changed to the evening so that everyone could rest at noon. Who knew that my suggestion was not only not adopted by the Party branch secretary, but I was also criticized and asked to make a self-criticism at the Party meeting.

    It's not that I am against holding meetings, nor is it that I am unwilling to do more work. I hope that the leading comrades of the Lanzhou commercial departments, in accordance with the spirit of the People's Daily editorial of June 7th, will streamline unnecessary meetings so that we can get reasonable rest time and work better for the country and the people.
      Lanzhou Textile Company, Hou Wenyu

### 让我们少开些会吧？

    让我们少开些会吧？
    编辑同志：
    我是兰州市纺织品公司的一个干部，读了人民日报六月七日发表的“让干部少开会，多下去”的社论以后，我感到兼职多，会议多的情况，在兰州市的商业部门中，在我们公司里也是很严重的。
    我是共产党员，也是青年团员，在公司里作政治工作，一身兼团支部书记，团总支组织委员、工会宣传员等十二职。我的身体不好，开会对我确实是个很大的负担。
    有一次，上午连续开了几个会以后，党支部又通知我中午还要开团支部大会。我建议把会改在晚上开，中午让大家休息。谁知我的建议不但没有被党支部书记采纳，反而被批评了一顿，还叫我在党的会议上作检讨。
    并不是我反对开会，也不是我不愿多做工作。我希望兰州市商业部门的领导同志，根据六月七日人民日报社论的精神，精简不必要的会议，使我们能够得到合理的休息时间，更好地为国家和人民工作。
