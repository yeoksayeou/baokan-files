    Dust Collector Liked by Miners
    Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, 3rd. A dust collector that can absorb dust flying in the roadways and prevent silicosis has recently been successfully trial-produced at the state-owned Zixing Coal Mine. This dust collector was created by He Ligong, a student from the Beijing Mining College who was interning at this mine.
    This dust collector has a simple structure and weighs less than two kilograms. It is installed on the drill rod and uses the rotation of the drill rod to bring dust into the dust collector. Tests have shown that it can absorb 80% to 90% of silica dust. This dust collector is very convenient to use, can be used in both large and small roadways, and does not affect the working efficiency of the pneumatic drill. More than ten units have now been made at this mine, and it is very popular with workers after being promoted in the work area.
    Last October, He Ligong came to this mine for an internship. He saw that when workers used dry pneumatic drills, the roadways were filled with dust, and some workers contracted silicosis due to breathing in too much silica dust. He thought: How good it would be to find a way to prevent silica dust from running out of the drill hole. Last December, with the encouragement and support of the mine leaders, he concentrated on studying this problem, and finally succeeded in trial production this May.
    New Urban Transportation
    Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 3rd. A new urban transportation tool—a small electric car—has been successfully trial-produced by the Tianjin Tram Company Repair and Manufacturing Plant. The first electric car, which looks like a small jeep, just appeared on the street yesterday and attracted the attention of many pedestrians.
    This electric car uses storage batteries as power, can travel fifty *li* per hour, and the electricity cost for every fifty *li* is only thirty cents. The machine structure of the electric car is simple, and the operation is also very easy. It does not emit any gas during driving, and there is no noise except for the slight rotation sound of the motor.
    The Tianjin Tram Company Repair and Manufacturing Plant also plans to trial-produce faster sedan-style electric cars and is planning to build several parking lots and charging stations in the city next year to enable these electric cars to be rented for public service.

    受人欢迎的新产品
    矿工喜欢的吸尘器
    新华社长沙3日电　一种能吸收巷道里飞扬的灰尘、防止矽肺病发生的吸尘器，最近在国营资兴煤矿试制成功。这种吸尘器是在这个矿山实习的北京矿业学院学生贺立功创造的。
    这种吸尘器的构造简单，全重不到两公斤。它安装在钻杆上，利用钻杆的转动，就能将灰尘带进吸尘器内。经过试验证明，它可以吸收80％到90％的矽粉。这种吸尘器使用起来很方便，大巷小巷里都可以用，并且不影响风钻的工作效率。现在这个矿已经做出十多部，在工区推广以后，很受工人欢迎。
    去年十月间，贺立功来到这个矿山实习。他看到工人们使用干式风钻的时候，巷道里弥漫着一片灰尘，有的工人因呼吸矽粉过多而得矽肺病。他想：能找到一种办法不让矽粉从钻孔里跑出来该多好。去年十二月间，他在矿山领导方面的鼓励和支持之下，专心研究这个问题，今年五月间终于试制成功。
    新的城市交通工具
    新华社天津3日电　一种新的城市交通工具——小型电动车，已经由天津市电车公司修造厂试制成功。第一部很像小吉普车的电动车昨天刚出现在街头，就吸引了很多行人的注意。
    这种电动车是用蓄电池作动力，每小时可以行驶五十华里，每行驶五十华里的电费只要三角钱。电动车的机器构造简单，操纵也很容易，在行驶的时候不排出任何气体，除了电动机轻微的旋转声以外，没有任何噪音。
    天津市电车公司修造厂还要试制速度较快的轿车式样的电动车，并且正在筹划明年在市内建设几处停车场和充电站，以便使这种电动车能出租为市民服务。
