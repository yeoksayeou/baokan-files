    114-Year-Old Miao Woman
    In the Miao Autonomous County of Lushan, Guizhou, there is a 114-year-old Miao woman named Jiang Chongma. This old woman has always loved peaceful life. She once made a pair of shoes by hand and sent them to the Chinese People's Volunteers fighting in Korea. Last year, she and four generations of her descendants signed the World Peace Council's "Appeal to the People of the World," expressing their firm opposition to the use of atomic weapons.
    This old woman often tells her descendants about the Miao people's past suffering and the Miao people's happy new life today under the leadership of the Communist Party, and encourages her descendants to study hard.

    114岁的苗族老太太
    贵州炉山苗族自治县，有一位一百十四岁的苗族老太太。叫姜重麻。这位老太太一向热爱和平生活。她曾经亲手做过一双鞋子，送给在朝鲜的中国人民志愿军战士。去年，她又带着四代子孙在世界和平理事会“告全世界人民书”上签名，表示坚决反对使用原子武器。
    这位老太太经常同她的子孙叙述苗族人民往日的痛苦生活和今天在共产党领导下苗族人民的幸福的新生活，并鼓励子孙们努力学习。
