Xinhua News Agency, July 27th: According to Reuters, Egypt's announcement of nationalizing the Suez Canal Company has shocked British government officials and the company's British directors. London sources believe that Egyptian President Nasser's action is a direct response to the British and American withdrawal of their offer to help finance the Aswan Dam project.

British Prime Minister Eden held an hour-long emergency meeting with the chiefs of the three armed services on the evening of July 26th. Those attending the meeting included Chief of the Imperial General Staff Templer, Chief of the Air Staff Bowes, and Chief of the Naval Staff Mountbatten. Later, shortly after midnight, he held talks with Foreign Secretary Lloyd, Lord Chancellor Kilmuir, and Lord Privy Seal Salisbury, as well as the diplomatic envoys of the United States, Britain, and France.

Suez Canal Company Deputy Manager Hughes told Reuters, "Besides being surprised, I have nothing to say."

Alexander Cadogan, a British director of the company, said: "No one would have thought the Egyptians would be so fanatical." He believes that the Egyptian government "does not have the ability to manage the canal. The Egyptians have no technicians."

Some British officials and economic figures, in informal talks, threatened to submit the matter to international courts and the United Nations Security Council for handling, and to "economically suffocate Egypt."

London newspapers on July 27th all carried the news on the front page with large headlines. Many bourgeois newspapers also issued threats, demanding that the British government take a so-called "firm stance" against Egypt. "The Times" called Egypt's action "a clear affront to Western interests." The "Daily Mail" even demanded that the British government send troops to reoccupy the Suez Canal area if necessary.

Xinhua News Agency, July 27th: Washington news: The Egyptian President's decision to nationalize the Suez Canal has caused a great shock among American officials. The US State Department has refused to issue a formal opinion until the full implications of the action have been studied.

According to United Press, the news caused a flurry of confusion in Washington diplomatic circles.

Xinhua News Agency, July 27th: Paris News: The Egyptian President's announcement of the nationalization of the Suez Canal greatly surprised French officials.

Senior French Foreign Ministry officials hurriedly held a meeting on the morning of the 27th to discuss the issue. According to United Press, the initial reaction of senior French diplomatic figures was to threaten to submit Egypt's action to the United Nations Security Council. If that doesn't work, they will submit the issue to the International Court of Justice in The Hague.

French Foreign Minister Pineau said: "The French government will study the issue and is prepared to consult with the governments of interested countries, especially Britain."

    埃及的决定在英美法引起震惊
    英国资产阶级报纸又对埃及进行威胁
    新华社27日讯　据路透社报道，埃及宣布把国际苏彝士运河公司收归国有的消息，使英国政府人士和这个公司的英国董事们感到震惊。伦敦人士认为，埃及总统这一行动是对英美撤销资助阿斯旺水坝工程的援助建议的作法的直接反击。
    英国首相艾登在七月二十六日晚上同三军首脑举行了一小时的紧急会谈。参加会谈的有帝国参谋总长田普勒、空军参谋长波伊斯和海军参谋长蒙巴顿。随后在午夜后不久又同外交大臣劳埃德、大法官基尔缪和枢密大臣萨利斯柏利，以及美、英、法三国外交使节举行了会谈。
    国际苏彝士运河公司副经理休斯对路透社记者说，“我除了感到惊讶之外，无可奉告”。
    这个公司的英国董事亚历山大·克达根说：“没有人会想到埃及人会这样狂热”。他认为，埃及政府
  “没有能力管理这条运河。埃及人没有技术人员。”
    英国一些官方人士和经济界人士在非正式谈话中威胁着要把这件事提交国际法庭和联合国安理会处理，并要在“经济上窒息埃及”。
    伦敦各报七月二十七日都在第一版以大字标题登载了这个消息。不少资产阶级报纸也发出威胁，它们要求英国政府对埃及采取所谓“坚定立场”。“泰晤士报”把埃及的行动称为“对西方利益的明显的冒犯”。“每日邮报”甚至要求英国政府在必要时派遣军队重新占领苏彝士运河区。
    据新华社27日讯　华盛顿消息：埃及总统宣布将苏彝士运河收归国有的决定，在美国官方人士中引起了巨大的震动。美国国务院拒绝在研究了这个行动的全部含义以前发表正式意见。
    据合众社报道，这个消息在华盛顿外交界引起了一阵混乱。
    据新华社27日讯　巴黎消息：埃及总统宣布把苏彝士运河收归国有的决定使法国官方人士大吃一惊。
    法国外交部高级官员在二十七日早晨匆促举行会议讨论这个问题。据合众社报道，法国高级外交界人士的第一个反应是威胁着要把埃及的这一行动提交联合国安全理事会。如果这一着行不通，就把这个问题提交海牙国际法庭。
    法国外交部长比诺发表谈话说：“法国政府将研究这个问题，并且准备和有利害关系的各国政府会商，特别是英国。”
