Xinhua News Agency, July 15th: New York News: A sensational kidnapping case of a newborn infant occurred in Westbury, Long Island, New York on July 4th. The kidnapped child was Peter, the Weinberg couple's baby boy, only a few days old.

The kidnappers left a note saying that they had to place two thousand dollars in small bills in a garage at a certain location before ten o'clock on July 5th, otherwise they would kill their baby. A day later, the kidnappers called the Weinberg couple again and raised the "ransom" to five thousand dollars.

The United States Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) did not begin to cooperate with the local police in searching for clues until July 11th. According to American law, the FBI can only intervene in a kidnapping case seven days after an American is kidnapped. Due to this rigid legal provision, the FBI has already "lost the opportunity to find important clues."

    在奇怪的法律下的奇闻
    美国刚满月的婴孩被绑票
    据新华社15日讯　纽约消息：纽约长岛威斯特堡在七月四日发生了一件轰动美国的婴孩绑票案。被绑的是魏恩伯格夫妇的刚满月几天的男婴孩彼得。
    绑匪留下一个条子说：他们必须在七月五日十点以前把二千美元小额钞票放在某地一个汽车间内，否则将杀死他们的婴孩。过了一天，绑匪又打电话给魏恩伯格夫妇，把“赎票”的价钱提高到五千美元。
    美国联邦调查局从七月十一日才开始协同当地警察找寻线索。根据美国法律，一个美国人在被绑架七天以后，联邦调查局才可以干预其事。由于这个法律的硬性规定，联邦调查局已经“失去了找到重要线索的机会。”
