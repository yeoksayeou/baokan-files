Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: The Professional Aviation Team of the Civil Aviation Administration of China dispatched agricultural aircraft on the 27th to carry out tasks of preventing and controlling various crop diseases and insect pests in parts of Shandong, Henan, Hubei, Jiangxi, Anhui, Qinghai, and Tianjin.

The person in charge of this professional aviation team told Xinhua reporters that in the first half of this year, they had already extinguished various crop diseases and insect pests on 1.61 million mu of farmland in more than a dozen provinces. In the second half of the year, they will continue to carry out prevention and control work on 650,000 mu of farmland.

The biggest advantage of using aircraft to prevent and control crop diseases and insect pests is that it is fast and timely, and the cost is relatively low. According to preliminary calculations by this professional aviation team in Henan, Shandong, Jiangsu and other provinces for controlling cotton aphids: a small aircraft can replace 4,000 manual sprayers. After spraying three times, it can extinguish cotton aphids in large areas of cotton fields, and the average cost is only 22 cents per mu.

    农业专用飞机再次出动 
    在七个省、市防治农作物病虫害
    据新华社讯　中国民用航空局专业航空队出动农业专用飞机，二十七日分别在山东、河南、湖北、江西、安徽、青海、天津等七个省、市的部分地区上空，执行防治农作物各种病虫害的任务。
    这个专业航空队的负责人对新华社记者说，今年上半年内，他们已在十多个省的一百六十一万亩的田地上扑灭了农作物的各种病虫害；下半年将继续在六十五万亩田地上进行防治工作。
    用飞机防治农作物病虫害的最大优点是迅速及时，而且费用较省。根据这个专业航空队最近在河南、山东、江苏等省治棉蚜虫的初步计算：一架小型飞机可以代替四千个人工喷粉器，先后喷药三次，就扑灭了大面积棉田里的棉蚜虫，而费用平均每亩只需二角二分。
