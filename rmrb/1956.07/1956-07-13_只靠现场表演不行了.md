    On-site Demonstrations Are No Longer Enough
    Li Ye
    Recently, many capital construction units have encountered a new problem when promoting new technologies: in the past, promoting advanced experiences such as two-handed slurry squeezing and three-stage parallel assembly line operations only required organizing on-site demonstrations to convince people wholeheartedly. Now, when promoting more complex technologies such as bamboo-reinforced concrete, dry-hard concrete, non-clinker cement, and cold-drawn rebar, relying solely on this method is no longer sufficient.
    Some units, when promoting these new technologies, still only talk about how important it is to promote advanced experience and then organize a demonstration, but as a result, these new technologies have not been widely adopted. The Mudanjiang construction site of the Northeast Textile Industry Bureau Engineering Company once organized workers to visit a dry-hard concrete demonstration three times, but they still did not learn this new technology. Some construction units have implemented it, but in reality, they have only reduced the moisture content of ordinary plastic concrete a little, which is not dry-hard concrete at all.
    Many construction workers in Heilongjiang Province still have doubts about how to prevent corrosion when using bamboo reinforcement instead of steel reinforcement, and why cold-drawn reinforcement can improve stress. We cannot say that people who have these doubts have conservative ideas and are unwilling to adopt new technologies. When people have not yet understood these new technologies, how can we expect them to adopt them blindly?
    In this case, how should we promote new technologies? The Heilongjiang Provincial Construction Trade Union has provided some experience. In June, they organized a dry-hard concrete experience exchange meeting, addressing the difficult questions of workers in the proportion of dry-hard concrete, the conclusions of scientific experiments, and other aspects. They invited the chief engineer of the unit that successfully experimented with dry-hard concrete and the director of the Building Materials Research Office of the Harbin Institute of Technology to explain from the three aspects of theory, experiment, and operation. This approach was very effective. The representative of the Mudanjiang construction site of the Northeast Textile Industry Bureau Engineering Company who participated in this experience exchange meeting said, "This time, we have truly learned this advanced technology, and there will be no problem promoting it back home." Units such as the Northeast Third Engineering Company, Harbin Engineering Company, and Jiamusi Engineering Company have learned this new technology and have begun to promote it widely.

    只靠现场表演不行了
    李烨
    最近，许多基本建设单位在推广新技术的时候，碰到一个新问题：过去推广双手挤浆、三段平行流水作业等先进经验，只要组织现场表演，就可以使人们心悦口服。现在，在推广竹筋混凝土、干硬性混凝土、无熟料水泥、冷拉钢筋等比较复杂的技术的时候，单靠这种办法已经有些行不通了。
    有些单位在推广这些新技术的时候，还是只讲一通推广先进经验如何重要，然后组织一下表演，结果这些新技术并没有推广开。东北纺织工业管理局工程公司牡丹江工地，曾经组织职工参观了三次干硬性混凝土表演，还是没有学会这种新技术。有的建筑单位虽然推行了，但是实际上只是把一般塑性混凝土减少了点水分，根本不是干硬性混凝土。
    黑龙江省许多建筑单位的职工对于竹筋代替钢筋如何防腐，冷拉钢筋为什么能提高应力等等，还有怀疑。人们有这些怀疑，不能说就是有保守思想，不愿意采用新技术。当人们还没有弄懂这些新技术的时候，怎么能要求他们就盲目采用呢？
    在这种情况下，究竟应该怎样来推广新技术呢？黑龙江省建筑工会提供了一些经验。他们在六月间组织了一次干硬性混凝土经验交流会，针对职工们在干硬性混凝土的配合比、科学试验的结论等方面的疑难问题，请试验干硬性混凝土成功的单位的总工程师和哈尔滨工业大学建筑材料研究室主任，从理论、试验、操作三方面作了讲解。这种作法收效很好。参加这次经验交流会的东北纺织工业管理局工程公司牡丹江工地的代表说：“这回才算真正学会了这个先进技术，回去推广就没有什么问题了。”东北第三工程公司、哈尔滨市工程公司、佳木斯市工程公司等单位学会了这种新技术，已经开始广泛推行。
