Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, July 3rd: Indian newspapers warmly support Premier Zhou Enlai's proposal to negotiate with the Taiwan authorities for the peaceful liberation of Taiwan.

    The "National Herald" on June 30th called this suggestion a "historic action that could lead to the peaceful liberation of Taiwan and Taiwan's return to the motherland." The newspaper said: Zhou Enlai's proposal "emphasizes the fundamental and lasting unity of the Chinese people, whether they are on the mainland or in Taiwan."
  The newspaper believes that "this proposal is irresistible, and it would be foolish and unpatriotic to reject it. It will not take long for the people of Taiwan to persuade or force the Taiwan authorities to take advantage of Zhou Enlai's proposal and liberate themselves from subservience to foreign enslavement."

    The newspaper also said: "The United States government must accept what the majority of the American people have already accepted, and admit China to its legitimate seat in the United Nations. There is no other way. All kinds of excuses have been shattered one by one."

    The "Deccan Herald" believes that "Premier Zhou Enlai's statement on Taiwan is a diplomatic action of great force, which Chiang Kai-shek and his allies will find difficult to deal with, except for hysterical abuse."

    The "Mail" pointed out that this proposal was made after the People's Republic of China recently announced a reduction in its military budget. The newspaper said: "The proposal has been made, and peace-loving countries at least hope that this proposal will be studied without prejudice to see if there is any real possibility of ending the current stalemate."

    The "Nagpur Times" said: "One cannot fail to appreciate the confidence in Zhou Enlai's words in this statement." The newspaper also said: "The Taiwanese themselves are tired of Chiang Kai-shek's occupying forces of refuge and are eager to restore normal political life."

    The newspaper said: "If the Taiwan issue is discussed on the basis of allowing the Taiwanese to govern themselves and Chiang Kai-shek's withdrawal from the political arena, then now is a more suitable time to resolve this issue than before."

    The Punjabi daily "New Century" in Jullundur City said that this speech marks "a new step in strengthening peace in the East. This is yet another evidence of the peace-loving nature of the government of the People's Republic of China."

    The Bengali daily "Epoch-Making Times" believes that "Zhou Enlai's policy is in line with the principles of political realism. Willingness to solve problems through peaceful negotiations is a politically healthy sign."

    The Urdu daily "Glory" said: "The step taken by Zhou Enlai will strengthen the position of those in international politics who hope to see China become a formal member of the United Nations."

Xinhua News Agency, Yangon, July 3rd: The "Myanmar New Light of Burma" published an editorial on July 2nd stating that Premier Zhou Enlai's speech at the National People's Congress on liberating Taiwan through peaceful means is of great significance. From this speech, it can be seen that there is an intention to hold a meeting between representatives of the People's Republic of China and representatives of the Kuomintang authorities.

    The editorial said that countries that recognize the Taiwan government will not agree with this opinion, while those countries that have established relations with the People's Republic of China will support this opinion.

    The editorial said, isn't it encouraging and hopeful when one of the two sides who regard each other as enemies due to hatred begins to ease up and suggest holding a meeting? The editorial continued, is there any special reason to prevent such a meeting from taking place? When the ambassadors of the United States and China are now able to sit down together in Geneva for discussions, why is it not possible for representatives of the People's Republic of China and representatives of the Kuomintang authorities to meet?

### 印缅报纸评周总理发言  支持关于台湾问题的建议

    印缅报纸评周总理发言
    支持关于台湾问题的建议
    新华社新德里3日电　印度报纸热烈支持周恩来总理提出的同台湾当局谈判和平解放台湾问题的建议。
    “国民先驱报”六月三十日把这个建议称为“可以导致和平解放台湾和台湾重返祖国的历史性行动”。这家报纸说：周恩来的建议“强调指出中国人民基本的和持久的团结，不论他们是在大陆上还是在台湾。”
  这家报纸认为，“这个建议是不可抗拒的，如果拒绝它，就将是愚蠢的和不爱国的。台湾人民不需要很长时间就可以说服或是迫使台湾当局利用周恩来的建议，并且把他们自己从屈从于外国的奴役状态中解放出来。”
    报纸又说：“美国政府必须接受大多数美国人民已经接受的东西，接纳中国到它在联合国中的合法席位上去，除此以外并无其他办法。各种借口都一一被粉碎了。”
    “德康先驱报”认为：“周恩来总理关于台湾的声明是一个具有巨大力量的外交行动，除了歇斯底里的谩骂以外，蒋介石和他的盟友将很难对付。”
    “邮报”指出，这个建议是在人民中国最近宣布削减军事预算以后提出的。这家报纸说：“建议已经提出，爱好和平的国家至少希望这个建议将得到没有偏见的研究，看看有没有终止目前僵局的实际可能性。”
    “那格浦尔时报”说：“人们不可能不在这篇声明中体会到周恩来说话时的自信”，这家报纸又说：“台湾人自己对蒋介石的避难的占领军已经感到厌倦，很希望恢复正常的政治生活”。
    这家报纸说：“如果是在让台湾人自治和蒋介石退出政治舞台的基础上讨论台湾问题的话，那么现在解决这个问题的时机要比以前适合”。
    朱龙多城旁遮普文日报“新世纪”说，这篇演说标志着“加强东方和平的新步骤。这是人民中国政府的爱好和平的性质的又一个证据”。
    孟加拉文日报“划时代报”认为：“周恩来的政策是符合政治现实主义的原则的。愿意通过和平谈判来解决问题是政治上健康的迹象”。
    乌尔都文日报“光荣报”说：“周恩来所采取的这个步骤将加强国际政治上那些希望看到中国成为联合国组织正式会员国的人们的地位”。
    新华社仰光3日电　“缅甸新光报”七月二日发表社论说，周恩来总理在全国人民代表大会上发表的关于通过和平方法来解放台湾的发言是有重大意义的。从这篇发言中可以看出想使中华人民共和国代表和国民党当局代表举行一次会议的意图。
    社论说，承认台湾政府的国家不会赞成这个意见，而那些同中华人民共和国建立关系的国家将会支持这个意见。
    社论说，当由于仇恨而互相看成眼中钉的双方中的一方开始缓和下来建议举行一次会议的时候，难道不是令人鼓舞和充满希望的事吗？社论接着写道，有什么特殊理由来阻止举行这种会议呢？当中美两国大使现在能够在日内瓦一起坐下来进行讨论的时候，为什么不可能让中华人民共和国代表和国民党当局代表碰面呢？
