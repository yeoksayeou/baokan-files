Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, July 21st. Telecommunications and electrical appliance industrial companies in the four cities of Shanghai, Beijing, Tianjin, and Shenyang, recently concluded an agreement on technical liaison and cooperation to exchange technical data and advanced production experiences.

	According to the requirements of Shanghai Telecommunications and Electrical Appliance Industrial Company, the Tianjin Municipal Joint State-Private Electrical Appliance Manufacturing Factory sent samples of its small reed loudspeakers to Shanghai. This type of loudspeaker has a beautiful design and high sensitivity, and is suitable for rural broadcasting. Factories in Shanghai that manufacture this type of loudspeaker will refer to these samples to improve their own products. The Shanghai Telecommunications and Electrical Appliance Industrial Company is also organizing technical data on five types of products with better quality, such as high-fidelity loudspeakers and tape recorders, according to the requirements of Tianjin, and is preparing to send them to Tianjin Telecommunications and Electrical Appliance Industrial Company for reference.

	The production of telecommunications and electrical appliances in the four cities of Shanghai, etc., is developing rapidly. For example, the output of wired and wireless products of Shanghai Telecommunications and Electrical Appliance Industrial Company in the second quarter of this year was equal to the entire year of last year, and the task for the third quarter is much larger than the second quarter. Establishing technical connections can jointly improve the technical level and improve product quality.

    四大城市电讯电器工业公司实行技术合作
    新华社上海21日电　上海、北京、天津、沈阳四个市的电讯电器工业公司，最近订立了技术联系合作的协议，互相交流技术资料和先进生产经验。
    根据上海电讯电器工业公司的要求，天津市公私合营电器制造厂把本厂出品的小型簧舌喇叭的样品寄到了上海。这种喇叭式样美观、灵敏度高，适于农村广播，上海制造这一类喇叭的工厂，将参考这样品来改进自己的产品。上海电讯电器工业公司也根据天津方面的要求，正在整理质量较好的高音喇叭、磁带录音机等五种产品的技术资料，准备送给天津电讯电器工业公司参考。
    上海等四个市的电讯电器工业生产发展很快。如上海电讯电器工业公司的有线、无线电产品，今年第二季度的产量和去年全年相等，第三季度的任务又比第二季度多很多。建立技术联系，可以共同提高技术水平，改进产品质量。
