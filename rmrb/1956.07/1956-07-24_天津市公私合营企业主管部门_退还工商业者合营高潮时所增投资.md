Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin: The more than 2,800 former private enterprise owners in Tianjin have recently received notices from the relevant authorities in charge of their respective public-private joint ventures, asking them to recover the investments they increased during the upsurge of full industry public-private joint ventures.

The increased investments made by private enterprise owners during the public-private joint venture upsurge consisted of real estate outside the enterprises, gold, silver, stocks, and bank deposits, totaling more than 5.4 million yuan. This was a patriotic action by private industrialists and businessmen during the public-private joint venture upsurge at the beginning of this year. However, some industrialists and businessmen acted solely on enthusiasm without considering their actual circumstances, leading to financial difficulties after increasing their investments. Since June, after investigation by the relevant authorities, it was decided to return all investments increased during the joint venture upsurge.

Initially, many enterprise owners were unwilling to take back these investments. After repeated explanations, most have gradually recovered their investments from outside the enterprises. A small number insisted that the relevant authorities accept their increased funds. After consulting with higher authorities, the relevant authorities have accepted their requests. To date, more than 3 million yuan has been returned.

Many industrialists and businessmen who have recovered their increased investments have expressed their gratitude to the government for its care. Xie Peixian, the former private enterprise owner and current manager of the public-private joint venture Shunxingde Iron Factory, recently retrieved more than 20 rooms that generate a monthly rental income of 150 yuan from the relevant department. He said, "The government's care for us is truly thorough." He expressed his determination to wholeheartedly serve socialism. Li Heting, the manager of the public-private joint venture Huashengyuan Tannery, has a family of six. His monthly salary and dividends provide him with an income of more than 200 yuan, allowing him to live comfortably. Despite repeated persuasion from the relevant authorities, he insisted on not recovering his investment worth more than 24,000 yuan, which was approved by the relevant authorities.

    天津市公私合营企业主管部门
    退还工商业者合营高潮时所增投资
    新华社天津讯　天津市两千八百多家原来的私营企业主，在最近分别接到了实行公私合营以后的各有关主管部门的通知，要他们收回在实行全行业公私合营高潮期间增加的投资。
    私营企业主在公私合营高潮期间增加的这批投资都是企业外的房产、黄金、白银、股票和银行存款等，总值五百四十多万元。这是在今年年初公私合营高潮期间私营工商业者的爱国行动。但有些工商业者只凭热情而没有考虑到自己的实际情况，以致在增资以后生活发生困难。自六月份以来，经过有关主管部门的调查，决定把合营高潮期间增加的投资一律退还。
    开始有很多企业主不愿收回这批投资，经过多次解释，大部分已经陆续把他们的企业外的投资收回。少数坚持要求各有关主管部门接受他们增加的资金的，各有关主管部门在请示上级以后已经接受他们的请求。到目前为止，已退回的资金共三百多万元。
    许多收回增资的工商业者都感谢政府对他们的照顾。原来的私营企业主、现任公私合营顺兴德铁工厂经理的谢沛贤，最近从有关部门领回了每月有一百五十元房租收入的二十多间房屋以后说，政府对我们照顾真周到。他表示一定要尽心尽意为社会主义服务。公私合营华胜元制革厂经理李鹤亭，全家共六口人，他每月薪金及股息可收入二百多元，生活宽裕，经有关主管部门数次劝说，他仍然坚持不愿收回价值两万四千多元的投资，也得到了有关主管部门的批准。
