Soviet Criticism of Dogmatism
"Problems of Philosophy" Magazine on Class Struggle and the Superstructure

Opposing dogmatism, advocating independent thinking, and using correct Marxist-Leninist viewpoints to criticize the shortcomings of past ideological work – this has been the main trend in Soviet ideological circles since the 20th Congress of the CPSU. The editorial "Exploring the Theory of Socialist Society" in the third issue of the "Problems of Philosophy" magazine, recently published, reflects this trend. The editorial emphasizes that the fundamental defect of many social science workers is dogmatism and scholasticism, detachment from socialist reality, and insufficient exploration of the fundamental theoretical problems of socialist society. For example, many philosophers and economists dogmatically studied Stalin's work "Dialectical and Historical Materialism," absolutizing the formula first proposed in this book – that the nature of the relations of production and the productive forces in socialist society are in complete conformity – and forgetting the fundamental principles of Marxism, denying the existence of contradictions in the development of the socialist mode of production. After the publication of "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR," some philosophers and economists went to the other extreme, looking for contradictions where there were none, prematurely talking about combining social ownership and collective ownership into a single form.

The editorial more profoundly criticized the dogmatism manifested in the issues of class struggle and the superstructure. The article stated that as a result of blindly worshiping authority and not engaging in independent thinking, Stalin's formula – that with the progress of socialism, class struggle would inevitably intensify – was dogmatically repeated. In fact, sharp class struggle was only inevitable in the initial years of the establishment of Soviet power, because at that time capitalists and landlords, supported by domestic and foreign counter-revolutionary forces, still wanted to overthrow the worker-peasant regime. In addition, class struggle in the Soviet Union only intensified during the period of eliminating the kulak class. After the victory of socialism in cities and villages, there was no basis for the intensification of class struggle. The formula put forward by Stalin at the February-March 1937 Plenary Session of the Central Committee became an argument for undermining socialist legality. The Beria gang had used this formula to cover up hostile activities.

The article stated that Stalin's formula in the work "Marxism and Problems of Linguistics" regarding the elimination of the superstructure was also dogmatically accepted by many people. This formula generated many trivial disputes and completely wrong ideas: it seemed that with the transformation of the economic base, the superstructure generated by the old economic base would be completely eliminated; it seemed that there was no inheritance in the development of the superstructure. History shows that in the transition of social structures, in the replacement of the old and new bases, not all of the old superstructure is eliminated, but rather undergoes an extremely complex process, including the replacement of the old regime with a new regime, the replacement of the old system with a new system, the replacement of the old ideas with new ideas, etc. Old ideas cannot be simply eliminated; they must be overcome through long-term ideological struggle, educational work, and the spread of new ideas. All these processes belong to the transformation of the superstructure, because transformation can never exclude inheritance in the development of the superstructure, and never exclude the relative independence and characteristics in the development of each part of the superstructure.

Stalin's formula regarding the elimination of the old superstructure generated trivial disputes: in the phenomena of spiritual life, which of literature, art, and science can be regarded as the superstructure, and therefore can be eliminated during the revolution, and which cannot be regarded as such, and therefore cannot be eliminated together with the old base. This formula aroused the revival of a harmful nihilistic tendency towards past culture, and this formula generated a closed-door attitude towards the modern culture of bourgeois society and bourgeois intellectuals.

The editorial pointed out that Soviet social science workers should independently explore new theoretical and practical problems raised by life, based on the general principles of Marxist theory and the summary of the new experiences of the people. (Li He)

    苏联批判教条主义
    “哲学问题”杂志论阶级斗争和上层建筑
    反对教条主义，提倡独立思考，用马克思列宁主义的正确观点批判过去思想工作的缺点，——这是苏共第二十次代表大会以来苏联思想界的主要动向。新近出版的“哲学问题”杂志第三期的社论“探讨社会主义社会的理论”反映了这种动向。社论着重指出：许多社会科学工作者的基本缺陷是教条主义和学究习气，脱离社会主义的现实，对社会主义社会的根本理论问题探讨得不够。例如，许多哲学家和经济学家教条主义地研究了斯大林的著作“辩证唯物主义和历史唯物主义”，把这本书里第一次提出的公式——在社会主义社会里生产关系和生产力的性质完全符合绝对化了，而忘记了马克思主义的根本原理，否认了在社会主义生产方式的发展中矛盾的存在。“苏联社会主义经济问题”出版以后，有些哲学家和经济学家又跑到另一个极端，向没有矛盾的地方找矛盾，过早地谈论什么必须把社会所有制和集体所有制化合为一个形式。
    社论比较深刻地批判了在阶级斗争问题和上层建筑问题上所表现的教条主义。这篇文章说，盲目地崇拜权威和不作独立思考的结果，就教条主义地重复了斯大林的公式——随着社会主义进展，阶级斗争将不可避免地尖锐化。事实上，尖锐的阶级斗争只在苏维埃政权建立的起初几年是不可避免的，因为当时受国内外反革命势力支持的资本家和地主还想推翻工农政权。此外，在苏联只有在消灭富农阶级时期阶级斗争才是尖锐化的。而当社会主义在城市和乡村中胜利以后，已经没有阶级斗争尖锐化的根据了。斯大林在1937年2、3月中央全会上提出的这个公式，成为了破坏社会主义法制的论据。贝利亚匪徒曾经利用了这个公式掩护敌对的活动。
    这篇文章说，斯大林的著作“马克思主义与语言学问题”中关于上层建筑的消灭的公式，也被许多人教条主义地接受了。这个公式产生了许多烦琐的争论和完全错误的观念：似乎随着经济基础的变革，由旧的经济基础产生的上层建筑也会消灭干净，似乎在上层建筑的发展中没有任何继承性。历史说明，在社会结构转变时，在新旧基础更换时，不是所有旧的上层建筑都消灭了，而是经历极复杂的过程，包括以新的政权代替旧的政权，以新的制度代替旧的制度，以新的思想代替旧的思想等等，旧的思想不能够简单地消灭，要经过长期的思想斗争、教育工作、新的思想的传播，才能克服。所有这些过程都属于上层建筑的变革，因为变革决不能排斥在上层建筑的发展中的继承，决不排斥在上层建筑的每个部分的发展中的相对独立性和特点。
    斯大林关于旧的上层建筑消灭的公式产生了烦琐的争论：精神生活的现象中，文学、艺术、科学中那些可以算是上层建筑，因而可以在革命时期消灭，那些不算因而不能和旧的基础一起消灭。这个公式引起了对以往文化有害的虚无主义倾向的复活，这个公式产生了对资产阶级社会的现代文化和资产阶级知识分子的关门主义态度。
    社论指出，苏联社会科学工作者应当根据马克思主义理论的一般原则和人民群众的新的经验的总结，独立地探讨由生活提出的理论和实践中的新问题。　（李　何）
