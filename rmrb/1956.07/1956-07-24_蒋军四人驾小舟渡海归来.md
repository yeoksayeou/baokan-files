Xinhua News Agency, Fujian Front, July 23rd: Four former Chiang Kai-shek soldiers sailed a small fishing boat from Tamsui, Taiwan, across the turbulent Taiwan Strait. After two days and nights of perilous sailing, they returned to the territory of Xiapu County, Fujian Province, on the evening of the 19th at around 11:00 PM. They were warmly received by the local military and civilians.

The returnees are: Wang Changgen, former Private First Class in the Hygiene Company of the 34th Division of the Chiang Kai-shek 52nd Army; Gan Lianghe, former Private First Class in the Chiang Kai-shek Army Second Guidance Corps; Huang Yiquan and Chen Faden, former Private First Class in the Chiang Kai-shek Army First Guidance Corps.

The four of them were originally fishermen from Lianjiang County, Fujian Province. In 1950, while fishing at sea, they were successively kidnapped by Chiang Kai-shek's soldiers to the coastal islands of Fujian awaiting liberation, and forcibly conscripted into the Chiang Kai-shek army. Later, Huang Yiquan and Gan Lianghe were arrested for trying to escape, and suffered severe torture and beatings, resulting in illnesses and incessant vomiting of blood, leading to their discharge. Wang Changgen was discharged due to chronic illnesses caused by mistreatment. Chen Faden, at the age of forty-eight, was discharged due to old age and physical decline. After being discharged, they drifted in Taiwan, living an extremely miserable life. Unable to endure the dark life in Taiwan any longer, and longing for their hometown, on the evening of the 17th, they sailed their own fishing boat, braving a near-death experience, from Taiwan towards Fujian, finally escaping the sea of suffering and returning to the mainland of the motherland.

    蒋军四人驾小舟渡海归来
    新华社福建前线23日电　原蒋军士兵四人从台湾淡水驾小渔船一只，横渡波涛澎湃的台湾海峡，经过两昼夜惊险的航海，十九日晚上十一点多钟回到福建省霞浦县境，受到当地军民的热情接待。　归来人员是：王昌根，原蒋军五十二军三十四师卫生连一等兵；甘良和，原蒋军陆军第二辅导总队一等兵；黄依铨、陈发登，原蒋军陆军第一辅导总队一等兵。
    他们四个人本来都是福建省连江县渔民，1950年在海上捕鱼时，先后被蒋军绑架到福建沿海待解放岛屿，强迫补入蒋军。后来，黄依铨、甘良和因逃跑被捕，遭受酷刑毒打，以致患病吐血不止被除役。王昌根因被磨折得患慢性疾病被除役。陈发登四十八岁，因年龄过大身体衰老被除役。除役后，他们流落在台湾过着极痛苦的生活。由于不堪再在台湾忍受黑暗的生活，加上思乡心切，十七日晚，他们驾自己捕鱼的小船，冒九死一生的危险，从台湾向福建方向行驶，终于脱离苦海；回到了祖国大陆。
