Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, 14th. Xinhua News Agency reporter Chen Zilin reports: China's automobile industry base—the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant—is completed! The domestically produced automobiles that the people of the whole country have been longing for have been successfully trial-produced on July 13th, on the eve of the third anniversary of the founding of the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant. The instruction of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao to "strive to complete the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant in three years" has been realized!

This was stated by Guo Li, Deputy Director and Chief Engineer of the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant, at a press conference held at the factory yesterday afternoon.

Since July 15, 1953, when the builders laid the white jade cornerstone inscribed by Chairman Mao himself, "Foundation Commemoration of the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant," on a barren land in the suburbs of Changchun, a magnificent automobile factory has been built next to the ruins of the Japanese militarists' bacteriological factory. Over the past three years, inspired by the call of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, tens of thousands of workers have transformed the factory blueprints imagined by the designers into reality with their creative labor.

In the process of plant construction, civil engineering, equipment installation, and production preparation have advanced simultaneously and intertwined. In terms of civil engineering, the plant construction tasks have been overfulfilled for three consecutive years, playing a significant role in accelerating the completion of the entire plant construction task. Now, surrounding the automobile assembly workshop, more than a dozen large and small factory buildings have been arranged; in the northeast of the factory area, a residential area for workers consisting of more than a hundred buildings has been built. The sounds of thousands of machines running and metal cutting have resounded in various production workshops. The auxiliary workshops first supplied more than 20,000 kinds of tools needed for automobile production to the basic workshops. Thirteen basic production workshops have completed the adjustment of automobile parts and assemblies, and have used these self-made parts and assemblies to successfully trial-produce a batch of domestically produced automobiles.

Tens of thousands of workers throughout the factory have been trained in the process of building the factory. With the help of a large number of Soviet experts, they have initially mastered modern automobile manufacturing technology, and more than 6,000 advanced producers have emerged. China's first technical team in the automobile industry has been formed here.

Now, the entire factory is transitioning to the stage of full-scale production. With the strong support of steel factories and various factories supplying cooperative products throughout the country, this factory will make all preparations and start mass production of automobiles in September as a gift to the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China and National Day.

Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, 14th. Xinhua News Agency reporter Chen Zilin reports: Today, the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant held a grand celebration rally to commemorate the third anniversary of the plant's construction, congratulating the birth of China's first automobile industry base.

On this joyous day, workers flocked to the general assembly workshop to visit the "Liberation" brand automobiles that were successfully trial-produced yesterday. Many people also adorned these successfully trial-produced "Liberation" brand automobiles with various colorful flowers made overnight. The entire factory formed a victory reporting team to report the good news to the Party and government leading organs of Jilin Province and Changchun City. All Soviet experts who helped build the factory and representatives from construction and installation companies and various cooperating factories in Changchun City came to congratulate.

At the celebration rally for the third anniversary of the plant's construction held this morning, the message of victory to the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao passed by all the workers stated: After three years of arduous efforts, the call of the Party Central Committee to "strive to complete the plant construction task in three years" has been successfully completed. The domestically produced automobiles that the people of the whole country have been yearning for have been successfully trial-produced.

Guo Li, Deputy Director of the First Automobile Factory, reported on the various achievements of the three years of plant construction and the preparations for starting production at today's celebration meeting. He emphasized: The construction workers have fully realized the call of the Party Central Committee and, while completing the three-year plant construction task, have successfully trial-produced the "Liberation" brand automobile. Zhao Mingxin, the Secretary of the Party Committee, said: The completion of the First Automobile Factory has written a glorious page in the history of China's automobile industry. The future task of the automobile factory is to make all preparations for starting production and ensure that 250 trucks are produced before National Day as a gift to the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China.

Sigachev, the chief Soviet expert who dug the first shovel of soil under the cornerstone together with the builders of the First Automobile Factory, expressed congratulations on behalf of all the Soviet experts stationed at the factory. He said that the birth of the first automobile factory in New China and the growth of a large number of technical and management cadres prove that the hardworking Chinese people, with the close cooperation of the people of China and the Soviet Union, can independently build and develop their own automobile industry.

After the meeting, a batch of brand-new "Liberation" brand automobiles drove out of the factory building from the general assembly workshop. The automobiles, carrying the factory's engineering and technical personnel and advanced producers, circled the field amidst cheers from tens of thousands of people, and then drove to Changchun City to report the good news to the Party and government leading organs of Jilin Province and Changchun City.

At 2:30 p.m., when the column of twelve colorful automobiles with the slogan "Celebrating the completion of the plant construction and the successful trial production of automobiles" drove into the city, Changchun City turned into a sea of joy. The staff of state organs and hundreds of thousands of citizens crowded on both sides of Stalin Street, vying to throw bunches of colorful flowers to the advanced producers on the automobiles. Responsible comrades from the Party and government organs of Changchun City all spoke at the victory reporting meeting, congratulating the completion of China's First Automobile Factory and the successful trial production of the "Liberation" brand automobile, and encouraged the workers of the automobile factory to make greater efforts to produce automobiles and talents in the future.

    第一汽车制造厂建成
    全厂职工举行庆祝大会通过向党中央报捷信
    新华社长春14日电　新华社记者陈子林报道：我国汽车工业的基地——第一汽车制造厂建成了；全国人民盼望已久的国产汽车已经在七月十三日，第一汽车制造厂建厂三周年前夕试制成功。中共中央和毛主席“力争三年建成第一汽车制造厂”的指示，已经实现了！
    这是第一汽车制造厂副厂长兼总工程师郭力，昨天下午在工厂举行的记者招待会上说的。
    自从1953年7月15日建设者们在长春市郊一片荒芜的土地上奠下了毛主席亲笔题字的“第一汽车制造厂奠基纪念”的白玉基石以来，一座宏伟壮丽的汽车工厂已经在日本军国主义者细菌工厂废墟的旁边，建设起来了。三年来，成千上万的职工在党中央和毛主席号召的鼓舞下，用创造性的劳动把设计家们想像中的工厂蓝图变成了现实。
    在建厂过程中，土木建筑、设备安装和生产准备齐头并进，交错进行。土木建筑方面连续三年都超额完成了建厂任务，对加速完成全部建厂任务起了极大作用。现在，环绕着汽车总装配车间，已经排列着十几座大小厂房；厂区东北，一百多幢楼房组成的职工住宅区已经建设起来。几千台机器的运转声，金属切削声，已经响彻在各个生产厂房内。各辅助车间首先供应了基本车间生产汽车需要的两万多种工具。十三个基本生产车间已经完成了汽车零件和总成的调整，并用这些自制的零件和总成，试制成功一批国产汽车。
    全厂上万名职工在建厂中得到了锻炼。他们在大批苏联专家帮助下，初步掌握了现代化的汽车制造技术，涌现了六千多名先进生产者。我国汽车工业第一支技术队伍已经在这里形成了。
    现在，全厂正向全面开工生产阶段过渡。在全国各钢铁工厂和供应协作产品的各类工厂的大力支援下，这个工厂将要做好一切准备工作，从九月份开始大量生产汽车，向中国共产党第八次全国代表大会和国庆节献礼。
    新华社长春14日电　新华社记者陈子林报道：今天，第一汽车制造厂举行了隆重的庆祝建厂三周年纪念大会，祝贺中国第一个汽车工业基地的诞生。
    在这个大喜的日子里，职工们川流不息地涌向总装配车间去参观昨天试制成功的“解放牌”汽车，许多人还把连夜赶制的各种彩花，给试制成功的这批“解放牌”汽车扮上了新装。全厂组成了报喜队，向吉林省和长春市党、政领导机关报喜。帮助建厂的全体苏联专家和建筑、安装公司、长春市各协作厂，都派代表前来祝贺。
    在上午举行的庆祝建厂三周年纪念大会上，全体职工通过的向党中央、毛主席的报捷信中说：经过三年的艰苦努力，已经胜利地完成了党中央“力争三年完成建厂任务”的号召。全国人民渴望已久的国产汽车，已经试制成功了。
    第一汽车厂副厂长郭力，在今天的庆祝会上报告了三年建厂的各项成就和开工生产的准备工作。他强调指出：建厂职工已经完满地实现了党中央的号召，在完成三年建厂任务的同时，试制成功了“解放牌”汽车。党委书记赵明新说：第一汽车厂的建成，给新中国汽车工业史上写上了光荣的一页。汽车厂今后的任务，是要作好开工生产的一切准备工作，保证在国庆节前生产出二百五十辆载重汽车，作为向中国共产党第八次全国代表大会的献礼。
    曾经和第一汽车厂的建设者们一起，在奠基石下挖开第一锹土的苏联总专家希格乔夫，代表驻厂的全体苏联专家表示祝贺。他说，新中国第一座汽车工厂的诞生和大批技术、管理干部的成长，证明勤劳的中国人民，在中苏两国人民亲密合作下，能够独立地建设和发展自己的汽车工业。
    会后，一批崭新的“解放牌”汽车从总装配车间开出了厂房，汽车载着工厂的工程技术人员和先进生产者，在万人夹道欢呼声中绕场一周，然后驶向长春市里向吉林省、长春市党政领导机关报捷。
    下午两点半，当打着“庆祝建厂完成，试制汽车成功”标语的十二辆彩色汽车行列开进市区的时候，长春市变成了欢腾的人海。拥挤在斯大林大街两旁的国家机关工作人员和成千上万的市民，把一束束五彩缤纷的鲜花，争先恐后地投给了汽车上的先进生产者们。长春市党政机关负责同志，都在报捷会上讲了话，祝贺我国第一汽车厂落成和“解放牌”汽车试制成功，并且勉励汽车厂职工，为在今后出汽车、出人材，做出更大的努力。
