    Suggestion to Launch Issue Discussions

    Recently, many newspapers and periodicals have launched issue discussions targeting their readers. For example, the Worker's Daily's discussion on "Can female employees continue to progress after having children?" and the Beijing Daily's discussion on "Should workers with backward thinking be discriminated against?" have both received good results.

    Therefore, I suggest that the People's Daily also launch discussions on some important issues at present. For example, could the newspaper discuss the issue of how enterprise leaders should care about the lives of their employees? (Liu Yi)
    Editor: We agree with Comrade Liu Yi's opinion on launching issue discussions in the newspaper. As for which issues need to be discussed, we also hope that more readers will offer opinions and provide materials.

### 建议开展问题讨论

    建议开展问题讨论
    近来许多报刊都针对自己的读者对象，开展了问题讨论。如工人日报关于“女职工有了孩子能不能继续进步”的讨论，北京日报关于
  “应该歧视有落后思想的工人吗”的讨论，都收到了很好的效果。
    因此，我建议人民日报也能针对目前一些重要的问题，开展讨论。例如：关于企业领导人员如何关心职工生活的问题，报纸上是否可以讨论一下。　（柳毅）
    编者：我们同意柳毅同志在报纸上开展问题讨论的意见，至于有那些问题需要讨论，还希望更多的读者提出意见和提供材料。
