    Anniversary of the Victory of the Mongolian People's Revolution

    July 11th of this year marks the 35th anniversary of the victory of the Mongolian People's Revolution.

    Before the 1921 Revolution, the Mongolian people suffered long-term cruel oppression and exploitation by domestic feudal lords and foreign colonists, and their lives were extremely painful. In 1911, during the Chinese Xinhai Revolution, the Mongolian people also staged an armed uprising, drove out the bureaucrats of the Qing government, and declared Mongolian autonomy. However, the fruits of victory were seized by feudal princes, and Mongolia became a feudal theocratic state. In 1919, the Chinese warlord Xu Shuzheng, with the support of Japanese imperialism, invaded Mongolia and forced Mongolia to abolish its autonomy. In early 1921, Japanese imperialism supported the Tsarist Russian bandits Semenov and the White Guard Ungern to invade Mongolia, restoring the Mongolian monarchical regime. However, the Mongolian people, who loved freedom and independence, always firmly fought against all oppressors.

    The victory of the Great October Socialist Revolution greatly encouraged the Mongolian people's struggle against imperialism and feudalism. Under the leadership of Sukhbaatar and Choibalsan, leaders of the Mongolian People's Revolution, the Mongolian people actively organized guerrillas to prepare for an armed uprising.

    On March 1, 1921, the revolutionary group led by Sukhbaatar and Choibalsan formally established the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party at the First Congress held in Kyakhta. At this meeting, the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party determined that the current tasks of the people's democratic revolution were: to strive for the national liberation of Mongolia, to carry out anti-feudal struggles, and to establish people's representative organs. According to the resolutions of the congress, a unified People's Revolutionary Army was formed on the basis of the guerrillas. On March 13 of the same year, a provisional people's government was established in Kyakhta.

    On July 6, 1921, the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Army, with the direct assistance of the Soviet Red Army, defeated the foreign invading forces and liberated the Mongolian capital, Khuree (now Ulaanbaatar). On July 11, a People's Revolutionary Government headed by Sukhbaatar and Choibalsan was established, achieving a great victory in the national democratic revolution. This day was designated as the Anniversary of the Victory of the Mongolian People's Revolution.

    In the early days of the revolution, taking into account the level of national development and the level of political consciousness of the people, and also because the military struggle against foreign armed intervention was still ongoing, the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party decided to temporarily retain the monarchical status of Bogd Khan, and implement a constitutional monarchy. However, the monarch's power was strictly limited by the People's Revolutionary Government.

    Later, because the foreign armed forces in the country were completely eliminated, and because the various democratic measures adopted by the People's Revolutionary Government achieved great results, and the democratic regime was greatly consolidated, it became possible to abolish the monarchy and establish a People's Republic. In 1924, after the death of Bogd Khan, on November 8, the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Government convened the First Great People's Hural (i.e., the People's Congress). On November 26, the first constitution in Mongolian history was passed, formally announcing the abolition of the monarchy and the establishment of a People's Republic, and affirming the achievements of the people's revolution in legislative form. Since then, the free, democratic, and independent Mongolian People's Republic, with the fraternal and selfless assistance of the Soviet Union, has rapidly moved towards the road of national construction and national rejuvenation.

    蒙古人民革命胜利纪念日
    今年七月十一日，是蒙古人民革命胜利三十五周年纪念日。
    在1921年革命以前，蒙古人民长期遭受着本国封建主和外国殖民者的残酷压迫和剥削，生活十分痛苦。1911年在中国辛亥革命的时候，蒙古人民也举行了武装起义，驱逐了清朝政府的官僚，宣告蒙古自治。但是胜利果实被封建王公所窃取，蒙古成了一个封建神权国家。1919年，中国军阀徐树铮在日本帝国主义支持下侵入蒙古，强迫蒙古取消自治。1921年初，日本帝国主义又支持帝俄匪徒谢米诺夫和白卫军温琴侵入蒙古，再度恢复蒙古的君主政权。但是，热爱自由和独立的蒙古人民，始终坚定不移地同一切压迫者进行斗争。
    伟大十月社会主义革命的胜利，大大地鼓舞了蒙古人民的反帝反封建的斗争。蒙古人民在蒙古人民革命领袖苏赫·巴托尔和乔巴山的领导下，积极组织游击队，准备实行武装起义。
    1921年3月1日，由苏赫·巴托尔和乔巴山领导的革命小组在恰克图举行的第一次代表大会上，正式建立了蒙古人民革命党。在这次会上，蒙古人民革命党确定了人民民主革命的当前任务是：争取蒙古民族解放，开展反封建斗争和设立人民代表机关。根据大会的决议，在游击队的基础上组成了统一的人民革命军。同年三月十三日，在恰克图成立了临时人民政权。
    1921年7月6日，蒙古人民革命军在苏联红军的直接援助下，击溃了外国侵略军队，解放了蒙古首都库伦（即现在的乌兰巴托）。七月十一日，成立了以苏赫·巴托尔和乔巴山为首的人民革命政府，取得了民族民主革命的伟大胜利。这一天便定为蒙古人民革命胜利纪念日。
    在革命胜利初期，由于考虑到国家发展的水平和人民政治觉悟的水平，同时由于反对外国武装干涉的军事斗争还在继续进行，蒙古人民革命党决定暂时保留着博格多嘉根的君主地位，实行君主立宪。但是君主的权力受到人民革命政府的严格限制。
    后来，由于国内的外国武装力量被完全肃清，由于人民革命政权所采取的各项民主措施获得伟大成效，民主政权大大巩固，使得废除君主和建立人民共和国成为可能。1924年，博格多嘉根死后，十一月八日，蒙古人民革命政府召开了第一届大人民呼拉尔（即人民代表大会）。十一月二十六日，通过了蒙古历史上的第一部宪法，正式宣布废除君主制，成立人民共和国，以立法形式肯定了人民革命胜利的成果。从此，自由、民主和独立的蒙古人民共和国在苏联兄弟般的无私援助下，向着国家建设和民族复兴的道路迅速迈进。　（白增华）
