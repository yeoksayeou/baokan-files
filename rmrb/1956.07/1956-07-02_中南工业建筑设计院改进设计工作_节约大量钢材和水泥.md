    Central-South Industrial Architectural Design Institute Improves Design Work
    Saving Large Amounts of Steel and Cement
    (Our Dispatch) The Central-South Industrial Architectural Design Institute is actively saving building materials and improving design quality in its designs. In the past two months, they have saved more than 2,800 tons of various types of steel, more than 4,000 tons of cement, and more than 800 cubic meters of timber. Drawing errors have also been greatly reduced.

    After criticizing right-leaning conservative thinking, this design institute actively tapped potential and tried to improve work efficiency. The design area completed in the first quarter of this year was equivalent to 55% of the design area for the entire last year, making it an advanced production unit in Wuhan. In April, the leadership of this design institute proposed the requirements of seeking more, faster, on the basis of "good and economical," and formulated 63 technical measures for saving and measures for drawing quality management. They also held design quality exhibitions and savings exhibitions, using physical objects to educate all personnel. Engineer Wang Zike and technician Yang Jianchou and others respectively proposed "saving hundreds of tons of steel and cement" and "one hundred drawings with zero errors," which received enthusiastic responses from employees. Their methods of saving building materials in design mainly involve the widespread use of new technologies, changing structural types, and using economical building materials on the basis of ensuring the sturdiness and applicability of the project. The Third Engineering Office of this design institute changed the chimney and water tower cylinder of a factory from reinforced concrete to brick masonry, saving 25 tons of steel and more than 70 tons of cement. In the construction organization design of a factory, they used dry-hard concrete instead of plastic concrete, saving more than 2,400 tons of cement.

    中南工业建筑设计院改进设计工作
    节约大量钢材和水泥
    本报讯　中南工业建筑设计院积极在设计中节约建筑材料，提高设计质量。最近两个多月来，他们节约了各种钢材二千八百多吨，水泥四千多吨，木材八百多立方公尺。图纸差错也大大减少。
    这个设计院在批判右倾保守思想以后，就积极挖掘潜力，设法提高工作效率。今年第一季度完成的设计面积，相当于去年全年设计面积的55％，成为武汉市先进生产单位。这个设计院的领导方面在四月间又提出了在“好、省”的基础上求多、求快的要求，制定了六十三项节约技术措施和图纸质量管理办法。他们还举办了设计质量展览会和节约展览会，用实物向全体人员进行教育。工程师汪自克和技术员扬建畴等人又分别提出“节约百吨钢材、水泥”和“百张图纸无差错的倡议，得到职工们的热烈响应。他们在设计中节约建筑材料的办法，主要是在保证工程坚固、适用的基础上，广泛采用新技术，改变结构类型和使用经济的建筑材料。这个设计院第三工程室将某厂的烟囱和水塔筒身由钢筋混凝土改为砖砌，节约了二十五吨钢材和七十多吨水泥。他们在某厂的施工组织设计中用干硬性混凝土代替塑性混凝土，节约水泥二千四百多吨。
