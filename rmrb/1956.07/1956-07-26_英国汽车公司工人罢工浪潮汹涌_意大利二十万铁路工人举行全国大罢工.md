Xinhua News Agency, July 23rd, London Dispatch: Nearly 50,000 auto workers began a strike today at 6:00 AM Greenwich time.

    This strike, called the largest ever by British auto workers, is in response to a call from leaders of fifteen unions of the British Motor Corporation, although only half of the 50,000 workers are members of these fifteen unions.

    The strike is to protest the company's dismissal of 6,000 workers last month. The British Motor Corporation is the largest automobile manufacturing company in the United Kingdom. Recently, due to the shrinking of overseas markets and the decrease in domestic demand, this company has taken measures to reduce production, including reducing working days and dismissing workers en masse.

    Given that automobile exports are an important source of foreign exchange for the United Kingdom, news indicates that this major strike will deal a heavy blow to the Eden government's "struggle to balance import and export trade."

    Xinhua News Agency, July 25th, London Dispatch: The major strike by British Motor Corporation workers is persisting and expanding.

    Dockworkers have also been drawn into the strike wave. On July 24th, 30,000 dockworkers in the Port of London refused to load automobiles produced by the company. In ports such as Liverpool and Southampton, the vast majority of dockworkers also refused to load the company's automobiles. This has resulted in a buildup of British Motor Corporation automobiles awaiting export at many ports.

    The dockworkers at these ports are taking boycott action in response to the call from the Transport and General Workers' Union. This union, with 1.3 million members, has also instructed mechanics, transport vehicle drivers, and barge workers to support the strike by British Motor Corporation workers.

    The Amalgamated Engineering Union, with 950,000 members, also instructed workers in hundreds of automobile enterprises on July 24th to stop manufacturing automobile parts for the British Motor Corporation.

    British government leaders are particularly anxious about the strike within this industry, on which Britain relies to earn US dollars. Eden has summoned Labor Minister Macleod and Transport and Civil Aviation Minister Watkinson to study the problem.

    On the first day of the strike, July 23rd, British stock market prices had already fallen.

    British officials and bourgeois news agencies have been vigorously proclaiming that British Motor Corporation workers have not all participated in the strike. However, strike committee chairman Jack Williams used the number of people participating in the strike in each department as an example to point out that the vast majority of workers have already joined the strike.

    Xinhua News Agency, July 24th, Rome Dispatch: According to a report by United Press, in response to calls from trade union organizations of different political tendencies, 200,000 Italian railway workers began a 24-hour national strike from 0:01 this morning.

    The major strike is to support the welfare demands of Italian state-owned railway workers. As early as four months ago, state-owned railway workers submitted requests to the government for wage increases and the formulation of new retirement and welfare regulations. However, the government has adopted a delaying or dismissive attitude towards the workers' requests during long-term negotiations.

### 英国汽车公司工人罢工浪潮汹涌  意大利二十万铁路工人举行全国大罢工

    英国汽车公司工人罢工浪潮汹涌
    意大利二十万铁路工人举行全国大罢工
    据新华社23日讯　伦敦消息：将近五万名汽车工人在今天格林威治时间六时开始举行罢工。
    这次被称为英国汽车工人规模最大的罢工是响应英国汽车公司十五个工会的领袖的号召而举行的，虽然在五万名工人中间，只有半数的工人是这十五个工会的会员。
    罢工是为了抗议这个公司在上个月解雇掉六千个工人。英国汽车公司是英国最大的一家汽车制造公司。近一个时期以来，由于海外市场缩小和国内需求量降低，这家公司已经在减少工作日以外，采取了大批解雇工人以紧缩生产的措施。
    鉴于汽车出口是英国赚取外汇的重要来源，有消息说：这次大罢工将给艾登政府的“平衡进出口贸易斗争”以沉重的打击。
    新华社25日讯　伦敦消息：英国汽车公司工人的大罢工正在坚持和扩大中。
    码头工人也卷进了这次罢工浪潮。七月二十四日，伦敦港口三万名码头工人拒绝装运这家公司出品的汽车。在利物浦和南安普顿等港口，绝大部分码头工人也都拒绝装运这家公司的汽车。这就使得英国汽车公司制造出来等待出口的汽车在许多港口堆积了起来。
    这些港口的码头工人是响应运输与普通工人工会的号召采取抵制行动的。这个拥有一百三十万名会员的工会还指令机械人员、运输车驾驶员和驳船工人一起来支持英国汽车公司工人的罢工。
    拥有九十五万名会员的英国混合机械工业工会也在七月二十四日指令成百个汽车企业的工人停止为英国汽车公司制造汽车零件。
    英国政府领导人员对这一个英国赖以赚取美元的行业内的罢工特别感到焦急不安。艾登曾经召集劳工大臣麦克劳德、运输和民航大臣华金森研究这个问题。
    在罢工开始的第一天，七月二十三日，英国股票市场价格已经下跌。
    英国官方人士和资产阶级通讯社一直在大力宣扬英国汽车公司工人没有能全部参加罢工。但是，罢工委员会主席杰克·威廉斯用各部门参加罢工的人数作实例，指出绝大部分工人已经参加了罢工。
    据新华社24日讯　罗马消息：据合众社报道，响应不同政治倾向的工会组织的号召，意大利二十万铁路工人从今天清晨零时一分起，开始了二十四小时的全国大罢工。
    大罢工是为了支持意大利国营铁路工人的福利要求。早在四个月以前国营铁路工人就向政府提出了增加工资和制订新的退职和福利条例的要求。但是政府在长时期的谈判中一直对工人的请求采取拖延或拒不理睬的态度。
