    The Debate Over Braids
    Long Zi
    Big girls and little girls often have two long braids hanging down their heads, some almost reaching their knees. These two long braids are sometimes spread on either side of the chest, and sometimes one in front and one in back.
    The braids are constantly arguing. However, the braids use a different language and the sound is particularly small.
    According to those who understand the language of braids, the braids are divided into two factions.
    One faction of braids says: We have almost become useless long objects. The longer we drag, the more we become like two dead snakes.
    The other faction of braids firmly opposes: Nonsense! Aren't we beautiful? Thanks to the girls for often putting on us a pair of red butterflies, white butterflies, or butterflies of other colors. Moreover, we are advanced experience learned from the Soviet Union!
    —You're the joke! Girls in the Soviet Union stopped wearing long braids long ago. The girls in Uzbekistan who braid many small braids are an exception. Generally speaking, wearing braids is dirty, takes time to wash, and is cumbersome when working. What beauty is there? To put it nicely, it's like the long tassels hanging from the temples of female characters in Peking opera!
    —That's right! You say we're like long tassels, which shows that we are the beauty of national form. If you oppose us, are you a nihilist of national culture?
    —Don't randomly put labels on people. You need to know that our hair is very useful when cut off. We can be used as fertilizer, medicinal materials, textile raw materials, theatrical headdresses, and can be used to...
    —You are simply a myopic pragmatist! Your concept of art is too poor. You need to know that girls love beauty the most. If we are not beautiful, why do girls wear us?
    —That's a manifestation of inertia! I heard that thirty years ago, Chinese men also wore long braids, although only one. Later, the Xinhai Revolution broke out and eliminated them. In those days, men also considered wearing braids beautiful, and some even cried when cutting them off. Today, I hope that a "Xinhai Revolution" will also take place on the heads of women, and I myself would be eliminated without regret.
    —You are simply a sufferer of infantile leftism!
    —You've made the mistake of right-leaning conservatism, and you don't even know it.
    The two factions are constantly arguing, taking place at any time and place on the heads of girls wearing long braids.
    It is said that there is no debate on heads that do not wear double braids; the debate is less on those with shorter braids. There is a kind of quail head, which cuts the hair short like a quail, which Europeans call "flapper hair". There is no debate on such heads. There is also a kind of hair that is left about a foot long and gathered into a brush on the back of the head. There is no debate on such heads either.
    It seems that the debate over braids is not easy to stop. The longer the two braids are, the longer the debate over braids will be, just like our currently most popular stereotyped essays.

### 发辫的争论

    发辫的争论
    龙子
    大姑娘们和小姑娘们的头上，往往拖着两条长长的发辫，有的快要拖过磕膝窝了。这两条长发辫有时分披在胸部的左右两边，有时又是一前一后。
    发辫们经常在争论。不过发辫用的是另外一种语言，声音也特别小。
    据懂得发辫语言的人说，发辫分成了两派。
    一派的发辫说：我们简直成了无用的长物了。愈拖愈长，就像两条死蛇一样。
    另一派的发辫坚决地反对：笑话！我们不是很美吗？多谢姑娘们还每每跟我们打上一对红蝴蝶、白蝴蝶，或者别种颜色的蝴蝶。而且我们是从苏联学来的先进经验呵！
    ——要你才笑话呢！苏联的姑娘们老早就不拖长辫子了。乌兹别克的姑娘们要梳很多的小长辫子，那是例外。一般地说，拖辫子是脏衣服的，梳洗费时间，做工作时拖拖沓沓。有什么美呢？说好听点，就像京戏的旦角的两鬓拖着的两束长流苏啦！
    ——对啦！你说像长流苏，那就表明我们是民族形式的美。你要反对，你是民族文化的虚无主义者吗？
    ——不要乱扣帽子吧。你要知道，我们头发，剪下来是很有用处的。我们可以做肥料，可以做药材，可以做纺织原料，可以做戏剧的型头，可以做……
    ——你简直是近视的实用主义者！美术的观念太贫乏了。你要知道，姑娘们是顶喜欢美的。我们如果不美，姑娘们为什么拖着我们？
    ——那是惰性的表现呵！我听说三十几年前中国的男子也都拖着长辫子，虽然只是一条。后来起了辛亥革命，把它们革掉了。在当年男子们也以拖辫子为美，剪辫子的时候还曾经有人哭过呢。今天，我希望，在女子们的头上也来一次“辛亥革命”，我自己就被革掉，一点也不可惜。
    ——你简直是左倾幼稚病患者！
    ——你犯了右倾保守主义的毛病，你自己不知道罢了。
    两派不断的争论，随时随地都在拖着双长辫子的姑娘们的头上进行着。
    据说，不拖双辫子的头上是没有争论的；辫子短些的，争论也就少些。有一种鹌鹑头，把头发剪得短短的就像一个鹌鹑儿，欧洲人管它叫“女青年头”。在那样的头上没有争论。还有一种是把头发留剩尺来长，在后脑杓上总结成一个刷把。在那样的头上也没有争论。
    看来，发辫的争论是不容易停止的。两条发辫愈拖愈长，发辫的争论也会愈拖愈长，像我们目前最流行的八股文章一样。
