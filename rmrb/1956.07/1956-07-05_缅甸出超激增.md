Xinhua News Agency, Rangoon, July 4th: According to a recent report by the Governor of the Union Bank of Burma, in the fiscal year ending September 1955, Burma's total exports of local products increased by 55.3 million kyats over the previous year, an increase of nearly 5.2%. Total imports decreased by 5.7% compared to the previous year. The foreign trade surplus for the past year increased significantly, from 93.1 million kyats in 1953-54 to 200.37 million kyats in 1954-55.

During the year mentioned in the report of the Governor of the Union Bank of Burma, Burma signed trade agreements with Czechoslovakia, Hungary, the Soviet Union, Poland, Indonesia, and the German Democratic Republic to open up and expand markets for its surplus rice. With the exception of Indonesia, these countries will export industrial products to Burma in exchange for Burmese rice under these agreements. In 1954-55, trade under these agreements accounted for approximately 9% of Burma's exports and 2.5% of its imports.

The total amount of rice to be exported to China according to the protocol signed this year, plus the rice exported to the above-mentioned countries, will amount to more than 500,000 tons. This batch of rice will be shipped within one year after the signing of the agreement or protocol, and it is expected that the trade volume in 1955-56 will increase significantly.

In 1954-55, the trade deficit with the United States was 28.7 million kyats, while the trade deficit with the United States in the previous year was 25.5 million kyats. This is due to a 36% decrease in the value of goods exported from Burma to the United States, and a 3% increase in the value of goods imported from the United States to Burma.

    缅甸出超激增
    据新华社仰光4日电　据缅甸联邦银行行长最近发表的报告，在截至1955年9月为止的财政年度里，缅甸土产品出口总量比前一年度增加了五千五百三十万缅元，即增加了将近5.2％。进口总值比前一年减少了5.7％。去年度的对外贸易出超大有增加，从1953—54年度的出超九千三百一十万缅元增加到1954—55年度的两亿零三百七十万缅元。
    在缅甸联邦银行行长报告谈到的这一年中间，缅甸同捷克斯洛伐克、匈牙利、苏联、波兰、印度尼西亚和德意志民主共和国签订了贸易协定，以便为它的剩余大米开辟和扩大市场。除了印度尼西亚以外，依照上述协定，这些国家将要向缅甸输出工业品来换取缅甸的大米。在1954—55年度，依照上述各项协定而进行的贸易量占缅甸出口货物的9％左右，占进口货物的2.5％。
    依照今年签订的议定书而要向中国输出的大米、加上向上述国家输出的大米，总数将达五十万吨以上。这批大米将在协定或议定书签字后的一年内运出，预料1955—56年度的贸易量将有大量增加。
    1954—55年度同美国的贸易逆差是二千八百七十万缅元，而前一年的对美贸易逆差是二千五百五十万缅元。这是由于缅甸向美国输出的货物的价值下降了36％，而缅甸从美国输入的货物价值增加了3％的原故。
