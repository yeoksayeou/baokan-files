Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, July 13th: The government delegations of Poland and Czechoslovakia issued a communique on the 12th regarding their talks. The communique stated that the Czechoslovak government delegation, headed by Prime Minister Široký, held talks with the Polish government delegation during their visit to Poland. In the talks, the two sides discussed the continued development of bilateral cooperation, issues of mutual concern, and some international issues. The two sides discussed the prospects for mutually beneficial economic and technical cooperation and planned to expand trade between the two countries. Basic agreements were reached on some important issues related to expanding economic cooperation.

The communique stated that both countries possess great potential for developing comprehensive economic cooperation with each other. This potential is guaranteed by natural and economic conditions and by the appropriate international division of labor at a high technical level within the socialist system using planned methods. The initial implementation of this new type of international division of labor has shown new prospects for continuously improving the labor productivity and living standards of the two countries. Economic cooperation will continue to develop through specialization and collaboration in their respective industries, and through direct and as extensive as possible contacts between their agencies and enterprises.

The communique announced that the two prime ministers also signed a protocol stipulating that, in accordance with the decisions of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (COMECON), the two sides will develop and adopt direct contacts as much as possible on economic issues of common concern to the two countries. The protocol also stipulated specific measures to achieve these contacts.

The communique stated that the two sides decided to finally resolve outstanding financial issues between them and reached a consensus on the final demarcation of the national border based on the existing borderline. The two governments will do their best to provide favorable conditions for the development of cooperation in culture, science, and other fields.

The communique pointed out that the two sides held completely identical opinions and views on foreign policy issues of concern to them.

The two governments believe that, under the favorable international situation, it has become possible to appropriately expand the membership of the United Nations. The earliest possible resolution of the issue of the People's Republic of China's representation in the United Nations will greatly help to strengthen the prestige of the United Nations.

The communique stated that the two governments are willing to establish and develop friendly and cooperative relations with all countries with different social systems.

The communique pointed out that among the most pressing issues for Poland and Czechoslovakia, the establishment of a European collective security system and the elimination of the threat of conflict occupy a primary position. The people of the two countries have suffered from the aggression of German militarism, and they have reason to express unease about the intentions of certain aggressive political groups in West Germany at present. The two governments believe that before a European collective security system is established and European security is reliably guaranteed, the alliance between the two countries and their joint participation in the Warsaw Pact defense system are equally important for guaranteeing the independence and security of the two countries.

The two countries will firmly develop cooperation with the German Democratic Republic and fully support all efforts made by democratic Germany for peace. The unification of Germany is a matter for the German people themselves and should be achieved as far as possible through contact and consultation between the two German states.

    波捷两国宣布全面发展经济合作
    赞成建立欧洲集体安全体系保证欧洲和平
    据新华社华沙13日讯　波兰和捷克斯洛伐克两国政府代表团在十二日发表了一项会谈公报。公报说，以西罗基总理为首的捷克斯洛伐克政府代表团在访问波兰期间，同波兰政府代表团举行了会谈。在会谈中，双方讨论了继续发展两国合作和双方有关的问题，以及国际局势的一些问题。双方曾经讨论了有关双方的互利的经济和技术合作的前景，并且计划扩展两国的商品交换。双方在一些有关扩展经济合作的重要问题上取得了基本的协议。
    公报说，两个国家都拥有很大的可能性来发展相互之间的全面的经济合作。这种可能性由于自然和经济条件以及用计划方法在社会主义体系内在高度技术水平上的适当的国际分工而得到保证。这种新型的国际分工的初步执行，已经为继续提高两国的劳动生产率和人民生活水平显示了新的前景。经济上的互相合作将通过它们在工业方面的专长和协作的道路，通过它们的机关和企业的直接的、尽可能广泛的联系的道路来继续发展。
    公报宣布，两国总理还签署了一项议定书，其中规定，根据经济互助委员会的决定，双方在有关两国共同的经济问题上，将尽可能发展和采取直接联系。议定书还规定实现这些联系的具体措施。
    公报说，双方决定要最后调整尚未解决的相互之间的财政问题，对以现有国界线为基础来最后划定国界的问题取得了一致的意见。两国政府将尽力为发展文化、科学等方面的合作提供便利条件。
    公报指出，对于与它们有关的对外政策的问题，双方的意见和看法是完全一致的。
    两国政府认为，在有利的国际形势下，适当地扩大联合国会员已经有了可能。尽快地解决中华人民共和国在联合国的代表地位问题，将大有助于加强联合国的威信。
    公报说，两国政府愿意同具有不同社会制度的一切国家建立和发展友好和合作的关系。
    公报指出，在对波、捷两国最迫切的问题中，建立欧洲集体安全体系和消除冲突的威胁的问题占着首要的地位。两国人民曾经遭受过德国军国主义的侵略，他们有理由对目前西德某些侵略性的政治集团的意向表示不安。两国政府认为，在欧洲集体安全体系尚未建立和欧洲安全尚未有可靠保证之前，两国的同盟和共同参加华沙条约的防御体系，对于保证两国的独立和安全是同样重要的。
    两国将坚定地发展同德意志民主共和国的合作，并且全力支援民主德国为和平所作的一切努力。德国的统一是德国人民自己的事情，应尽可能通过两个德意志国家的接触和协商以求得德国的统一。
