Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, July 8th: Famous Hong Kong film actor Kwong Shan-siu and others issued statements to the Hong Kong press on the peaceful liberation of Taiwan, endorsing Premier Zhou Enlai's speech at the Third Session of the First National People's Congress.

Kwong Shan-siu said: Premier Zhou's proposed method of peaceful liberation of Taiwan is reasonable and fair, and the attitude is extremely generous. If the Taiwan authorities and their military and political personnel still have a shred of patriotism and concern for the people, they should immediately conduct negotiations with the People's Government on the peaceful liberation of Taiwan.

Kwong Shan-siu visited Beijing and other places this year. He said: "On the mainland of the motherland, I personally saw that there are many former Kuomintang military and political personnel who are working hard for the country and the people together with the Communist Party today. They have not necessarily done things that were detrimental to the people in the past, but once they realize they were wrong and are determined to serve the people, they are not only treated with the people's generosity of 'not blaming the past,' but also trusted by the people and hold leading positions in the government."

Kwong Shan-siu was once the chairman of the Hong Kong and Kowloon Motion Picture Industry Workers' Free Union and only announced his break with this pro-Chiang organization in March of this year. He said: "I myself have also been someone who went astray in the past, but after I decided to rely on the motherland, on this visit, all my new and old friends and government leaders expressed welcome, care, and concern for me. No one said to me, 'You are late.' No one discriminated against me in the slightest."

Another influential actor in the Hong Kong film industry, Huang He, also told the press:

I have been to Taiwan, where the soldiers and ordinary people of Taiwan are constantly asking about the situation in their hometowns. However, because the Taiwan authorities block information, it is difficult to learn about the current situation in their hometowns. If they once know that the motherland has entered a new stage that has never been seen before, I believe they will love their motherland even more."

    香港著名电影演员邝山笑等发表谈话
    台湾当局应早日悔悟
    据新华社广州8日电　香港著名电影演员邝山笑等人就和平解放台湾问题对香港报界发表谈话，拥护周恩来总理在第一届全国人民代表大会第三次会议上的发言。
    邝山笑说：周总理提出的和平解放台湾的方式是合情合理的，态度是极其宽大的。台湾当局及其军政人员要是还有一点爱国爱民的心肠，就应该立刻与人民政府进行和平解放台湾的谈判。
    邝山笑曾经在今年到北京等地参观访问。他说：“在祖国大陆上，我亲眼见到有不少是国民党的旧军政人员，他们今天同共产党一道，在努力地为国为民服务。他们过去并非没有做过对人民不利的事，但一经认识自己错了，决心为人民服务时，他们不仅受到人民‘既往不咎’的宽大待遇，而且一样受到人民的信任，担任着政府的领导工作。”
    邝山笑曾经是港九电影从业人员自由工会主席，今年三月间才宣布和这个亲蒋机构脱离关系，他说：“我自己过去也是曾经走入过歧途的人，但我决心依靠祖国后，这次回去观光，一切新知旧友及政府首长都对我表示欢迎、爱护和关怀。没有一个人对我说：‘你迟了’。也没有一个人对我有一丝一毫的歧视。”
    香港电影界中另一位有地位的演员黄河也对报界发表谈话说：
    我去过台湾，在那里，台湾的军队士兵和老百姓不断询问家乡的情况。但是因为台湾当局封闭消息，很难了解到家乡目前的情况，如果他们一旦知道今天祖国已经踏入了从来没有过的新阶段的时候，我相信他们一定会更加热爱自己的祖国的。”
