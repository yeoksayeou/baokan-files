The Story of the Bridge
	Tan Jun
	In Jishou Town, where the People's Committee of the Xiangxi Miao Autonomous Prefecture in Hunan Province is located, there is a story: Many years ago, a kind-hearted "immortal" passed through here and saw that the banks of the surging Dong River were crowded with people. Some were selling firewood, some were transporting salt, some were selling rice, some were going to the market to do business, some were taking their children and daughters to visit relatives, and some were helping the old and carrying the young to watch the fun. Everyone was arguing and vying to cross the river. There were only two small boats ferrying people across the river. Some people became impatient and crowded onto the boats; the boats were overloaded and the water was rapid, and then there was a strong wind, so the boats and the people all sank into the water. When the "immortal" saw this, he wanted to build a bridge for the Miao and Han people of Jishou, but unfortunately, an unlucky person revealed his secret, and the bridge was not built, only two piers were erected.
	For many years, how much the Miao and Han people have longed for a bridge over the Dong River! In the teens of the Republic of China, the reactionary government said it wanted to "benefit the people" and build an iron cable bridge here. As soon as the news spread, the kind Miao and Han people near Jishou Town were overjoyed, and many people donated their hard-earned money and grain. Unexpectedly, day after day passed, and the bridge was still nowhere to be seen. While cursing those Kuomintang swindlers, people often sighed and said, "I wonder when a real immortal will come to help us build this bridge!"
	That day finally came.
	In October 1955, the sound of blasting rocks echoed over the Dong River, and the construction of the Jishou Bridge began. The state allocated 30,000 yuan, and also brought in bridge-building technicians and workers, plus hundreds of Miao and Han laborers who participated in the project. This bridge, which the Miao and Han people had longed for for many years, was successfully completed in May of this year.
	For this great happy event, the Miao and Han people sang:
	We have been looking forward to it for generations!
	Someone to build a bridge for us,
	Now hands are joined across the Dong River,
	Thanks to our benefactor, the Communist Party!
	Bringing much happiness to the people.
	Just as the mountain songs sing, the bridge brings much happiness to the people. This bridge is twenty zhang long, one zhang six wide, and three zhang six high. In addition to pedestrians coming and going on both sides of the bridge, cars and horse-drawn carriages can also pass through the middle. The highway from Jishou to Guzhang County will begin construction this autumn. When this highway is open to traffic, many resources abundant in the mountainous areas, such as timber, tea, and medicinal materials, can also be transported out in large quantities.

    桥的故事
    谭军
    在湖南省湘西苗族自治州人民委员会所在的地方——吉首镇，传说着这样一个故事：很多年以前，有一个好心肠的“神仙”，打这里经过，见汹涌奔腾的峒河两岸，挤了很多人，卖柴的，运盐的，粜米的，赶场作生意的，牵儿带女走亲戚的，扶老携幼看热闹的，一齐吵吵嚷嚷，争着要过河去。河里只有两只小船摆渡。有些人等得不耐烦了，争着往船上挤；船重水急，中途又碰上大风，结果，连船带人一齐沉到水里去了。这位“神仙”看了，就想给吉首的苗汉族人民架一座桥，可是不幸被一个不吉利的人说破了，桥没有架成，仅仅筑起了两个桥墩。
    多少年来，苗汉人民是多么盼望着在峒河上有一座桥啊！民国十几年的时候，反动政府说要“为民造福”，在这里架一条铁索桥。消息一传开，吉首镇附近善良的苗汉人民，无不喜出望外，许多人把自己劳动所得的钱和粮食捐了出来。不料日子一天一天过去，桥仍然没有影子。人们在咒骂那些国民党骗子手的时候，常常叹息着说：“不知道哪一天，真有一个神仙来帮我们架起这座桥啊！”
    这一天终于来了。
    1955年10月间，峒河上响起了爆炸岩石的炮声，吉首大桥的工程动工了。国家拨了三万元的款，又调来了修桥技术人员和工人，加上几百个参加这一工程的苗汉族民工，这座苗汉族人民想望多年的大桥在今年五月份胜利完成了。
    为了这件大喜事，苗汉族人民歌唱着：
    祖祖辈辈就盼望哟！
    有人来给我们搭个桥，
    如今峒河上拉起了手，
    搭帮恩人共产党啊！
    给人民带了许多幸福来。
    正像山歌中唱的，桥，给人民带了许多幸福来。这座桥长达二十丈，宽一丈六，高三丈六，桥上除了两边可以来往行人以外，中间还可以通行汽车和马车。吉首到古丈县的公路，今年秋季就要开工，等这条公路通车以后，山区盛产的许多物资，如木材、茶叶、药材等，也可以大量外运了。
