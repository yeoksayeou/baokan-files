Prospecting Mount Dabei
Ye Fansheng

                    May 10th

    We completed the prospecting task at Xiecun and marched towards Mount Dabei.

    The car sped along the rugged mountain road for more than three hours. Everyone in the car was covered in dust and grime from the wind and sand. We looked at each other and couldn't help but laugh.

    At noon, the car arrived in Kangcheng. Getting out of the car, the blazing sun beat down on our heads, making us hot and thirsty. I went into a farmer's house by the roadside and drank several bowls of cool water, which felt very refreshing. The farmer and his wife were very excited when they heard that we were there to find treasure. Pointing happily to the mountain ridge opposite, they said, "Are you here to find treasure? That's great! Soon there will be mines opened here, railways built, and we will even have electric lights!" They then asked with concern, "Are there just a few of you?" I said with a smile, "There are more people coming. If everyone came, I'm afraid this village wouldn't be able to accommodate us." They quickly said, "Don't worry, comrades, come one, come all! We guarantee we'll find room for you."

    In the afternoon, we took the blueprints and went to Mount Dabei, the site where construction would take place. Mount Dabei is a mountain within mountains, a mountain upon mountains, and we had to climb over many cliffs and precipices to reach it. At the foot of the mountain, an old villager told us, "Mount Dabei, a bumpy slope, not even a rabbit's footprint can pass." This was indeed true, but not entirely reliable. There were no roads on the mountain, and many steep slopes. Although we put in a lot of effort, we finally managed to climb to the top.

    We finally climbed to the top of the mountain, sweat pouring down like rain. I looked down at my shoes, and the toes were gaping open like a tiger's mouth. But we were very happy. The gentle mountain breeze felt so comfortable. After resting for a while, we started working. We looked at the map, determined the orientation, and found the location of the drill holes. Hey! The location of the drill holes was truly dangerous, all on forty-five-degree bumpy slopes halfway up the mountain. To level the base and erect the drilling tower, we had to use explosives and steel drills. Someone complained, "This place is really..." Before he could finish, Comrade Jia Ming from the Thirty-First Detachment immediately followed up with, "It doesn't matter, no matter where it is, we will change it!"

        May 13th

    It was time for breakfast, and everyone rushed to the makeshift kitchen. In the kitchen, there was nothing but a steamer of steamed buns. Because these steamed buns were two or three days old, steamed cold, and then steamed again, there was a layer of sticky silk on the steamed buns. When you broke it open, a sour smell rushed straight into your nose. Normally, we would have complained to the cook. But what could we do with the cook at this time? Up here in the mountains, they also wanted to make something good for the comrades, but oil, flour, pots, and stoves hadn't been brought up yet. Yesterday, they had walked more than twenty miles just to buy some pickles. We all knew this situation, so no one said anything. Everyone chewed with enthusiasm, and it tasted quite sweet!

    After breakfast, the Thirty-First Detachment and the Installation Team prepared to set off for Mount Datong to open a road. Some were checking tools, some were packing food, and some were filling water bottles. Little Zhang was like a road-building hero, carrying a pickaxe, a water bottle on his back, a towel around his neck, and a rope around his waist, saying he was preparing to climb the mountain. People were laughing and joking. The comrades knew that without a road, it was like not having a throat, and our work would be difficult. The comrades knew no less about the difficulties than I did, and they all had enough courage to find ways to overcome them.

    In the evening, the road-opening team returned. The sharp pickaxes had been worn into an egg shape, and one could imagine how they had fought with the rocks during the day. I saw blisters on their palms; from the broken gloves, I smelled the scent of fresh soil and sweat. Although they didn't tell me anything, I understood everything from these things.

    Following a small path, I returned to the tent made of canvas. Several comrades were playing the harmonica, and everyone sang "Song of the Prospecting Team" along with the harmonica.

        May 15th

    The captain returned from the county, his face full of smiles, and told us, "Everything is going smoothly, the county committee and all the units are very supportive of us! Things are going to get better." I believe things will get better. Although we live in the deep mountains, we are not alone.

    Sure enough. At noon, two large trucks arrived, and electricians, drillers, telephone workers, repairmen...all came. Another force, they are marching with us towards the high mountains.

    In the evening, I passed by the kitchen and smelled a meaty aroma. It had been a long time since I had tasted meat. Where did the cook buy it from? I went to the kitchen and asked, and it turned out that the county cooperative had brought pork here to sell to us. The cook, Old Sun, happily told me, "When they heard that we were here to find treasure, everyone scrambled to sell us pork."

        May 16th

    While the union committee member and I were discussing how to carry out cultural and sports activities, a worker from the Installation Team ran over, waving his fist, and shouted happily, "The diesel generator is fixed!" That's great! Our construction site and dormitory will soon be bright. The young men of the Installation Team are really remarkable. They are striving to be an advanced team, with everyone advanced. No, everyone is doing this now.

        May 23rd

    The stubborn rocks have succumbed to our labor. We have opened the road on Mount Dabei.

    Drilling machines, drilling towers, and water pumps have all arrived.

    The weather is particularly good today, with no wind or sand. Pushing open the door, you can see the drilling towers erected on the mountainside at a glance. The workers have already started working formally.

    A new life has begun, and the prelude to building Mount Dabei has begun. I can't suppress the excitement in my heart. Because it is we—the geological prospecting workers—who are opening this prelude.

    勘探大北山
    叶放生
                    五月十日
    我们完成了薛村的勘探任务，向大北山进军了。
    汽车在崎岖的山路上奔驰了三个多钟头。汽车上所有的人都被风沙刮得成了灰土人儿，大家相对而视，都不禁笑了。
    中午，汽车开到了康城。下了车，火热的太阳照在头顶上，晒得人又热又渴。我走进路旁一个老乡的家里，喝了几碗凉水，觉得很舒畅。农家夫妇听说我们是来探宝的，他们很兴奋。高兴地指着对面山岗说：“你们就是来这里探宝的吗？真是太好了，过不久这儿就要开矿山、修铁路，我们还能点上电灯呢！”他们又关心地问：“你们就这几个人吗？”我笑着说：“还有人没有来呢，要都来了就怕这村住不下”他们赶忙说：“放心吧同志，你们都来吧！保证你们准能住得下。”
    下午，我们拿了蓝图到将要施工的现场大北山去。大北山是山中的山，山上的山，要翻过许多悬崖绝壁才能到达。在山下时，有个老乡告诉我们说：“大北山，疙瘩坡，兔子脚印也不过。”这话是确实的，可也不完全可靠，山上没有路，险峻陡坡很多，我们虽然费了很大劲，到底还是爬上去了。
    好不容易爬上山顶，汗珠像雨水一样地淌着，我低头看看鞋子，鞋头老虎张大嘴啦。不过我们却很愉快，徐徐的山风吹到身上，真舒服呵。大家休息了一会，就开始工作了。我们看地图、定方位，找钻孔的位置。嗨！钻孔的地点可真险，都在半山腰四十五度的疙瘩坡上，要平底盘、立钻塔，就得用炸药，钢钎。不知是谁埋怨了一句：“这地方真是……”话还没说完，三十一分队的贾明同志马上接着说：“没什么，不管什么地方咱们都将叫他变样儿。”
        五月十三日
    开早饭了，大家都朝临时架起的伙房奔去。伙房里除了一笼蒸馍而外，啥也没有。因为这蒸馍有两、三天了，蒸了冷，冷了又蒸，所以蒸馍上长了一层粘糊丝，掰开来就有一股酸溜溜的味儿直往鼻子里冲。在平时，可真要向炊事员提意见哩。可是这时候叫炊事员又有什么办法呢？在这高山上，他们也想给同志们做点好吃的，可是，油、面、锅、灶都没有搬来，昨天他们只为买点咸菜就走了二十多里路。这情况，我们都知道，因此，谁也没有说什么，大家带劲地嚼着，还满香甜哩！
    吃完早饭，三十一分队和安装队准备出发到大同山去开路。有的在检查工具，有的在整理干粮包，有的往水壶里灌水。小张像个筑路小英雄，扛了把尖镐，背着水壶，脖子上围了条毛巾，腰里还带了根绳子，说是准备爬山用的。人们都在说笑。同志们知道没有路等于没有喉管，我们的工作就难进行。关于困难，同志们并不比我知道得少，都有足够的勇气，想办法来克服。
    晚上，开路的队伍回来了。尖尖的镐头已经磨成鸭蛋形，可以想像到白天他们怎样和岩石搏斗。我看到他们的手掌上磨出了泡；从破手套上，我闻到鲜土和汗水的味儿。虽然他们并没有告诉我什么，但是从这些东西上面，我了解了一切。
    顺着一条小路，我回到帆布搭的帐篷里。几个同志正在吹口琴，随着口琴声，大家唱起了“勘探队员之歌”。
        五月十五日
    队长从县里回来，满面笑容地告诉我们：“一切都很顺利，县委和各单位都非常支持我们！情况就要好起来了。”我相信，情况会好起来的。我们虽生活在深山中，我们并不是孤独的。
    果然不错。中午，就开来了两辆大卡车，电工，钻工，电话工，修理工……都来了。又是一批力量，他们和我们共同向高山进军。
    傍晚，我经过厨房，闻到一股肉香。好久没尝到肉的滋味了。炊事员从哪里买来的呢？走到厨房一问，原来是县合作社把猪肉运到这里卖给我们的。炊事员老孙高兴地告诉我说：“人家听说咱们来这里探宝，都抢着把猪肉卖给咱们。”
        五月十六日
    我和工会委员正在商量怎样开展文化体育活动的时候，安装队的一个工友挥着拳头奔过来，他高兴地喊道：“柴油发电机修好了。”真太好了！我们的工地、宿舍马上就要光明起来了。安装队这帮小伙子可真了不起，他们正在争取做到全队先进，人人先进。不，现在我们所有的人都在这样做呢。
        五月二十三日
    顽固的岩石在我们的劳动下屈服了。我们开辟通了大北山上的路。
    钻机、钻搭、水泵都来了。
    今天的天气特别好，没有刮风沙。推开了门，一眼能看到山腰里竖立着的钻搭。工人们已经开始正式工作了。
    新的生活开始了，建设大北山的序幕揭开了。我按耐不住心里的激动。因为拉开这序幕的正是我们——地质勘探工作者。
