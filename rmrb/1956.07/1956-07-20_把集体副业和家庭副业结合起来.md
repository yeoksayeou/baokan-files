    Combining Collective Sidelines and Household Sidelines

    (By our own dispatch) Some agricultural production cooperatives in Hubei Province have encountered a problem in developing diversified economies: which sideline productions should be managed uniformly by the cooperative, and which should be assigned to cooperative members' households for management. The Hubei Daily published a commentary on this issue on July 15th. The commentary stated: At present, some cadres in many places do not consider the specific conditions of each cooperative from the perspective of benefiting production and members' lives when dealing with this issue. Instead, they emphasize centralization in everything and pursue "high-level" approaches, centralizing even the small-scale sideline businesses run by cooperative members' families under the unified management of the cooperative, even collecting all the chickens and ducks raised by each household for public ownership. Some cooperatives, while not excessively emphasizing centralization, do not give members time to engage in household sidelines and do not help members overcome the difficulties of running sidelines.

    Will cooperative members' engagement in household sidelines necessarily affect the cooperative's collective production? The commentary introduced the experience of the Xinghuo Agricultural Production Cooperative in Qizhan Township, Huangpi County. The cadres of this cooperative first made unified plans for the sidelines that were managed uniformly by the cooperative and those that were managed by cooperative members' households, based on the cooperative's existing conditions and from the perspective of benefiting production. Then, they comprehensively considered raw materials, sales channels, funds, equipment, and technology, and helped the members formulate household sideline production plans. In this way, the blindness of cooperative members in engaging in household sidelines was avoided, and the contradiction between the decentralized management by members and the unified management by the cooperative was overcome. The commentary pointed out: As long as cooperative members' household sidelines are properly arranged, not only will they not affect collective production, but they can also more fully utilize farmers' spare time and improve the utilization rate of labor. When cooperative members' household sidelines are well-managed, their disposable income will become more flexible, and they will love the cooperative more and produce more actively.

### 把集体副业和家庭副业结合起来

    把集体副业和家庭副业结合起来
    本报讯　湖北省有些农业生产合作社在开展多种经营的时候，出现了一个问题：那些副业生产应该由社里统一经营，那些应该划归社员家庭经营。湖北日报在七月十五日就这个问题发表了评论。评论中说：现在有不少地方的干部，处理这个问题不是根据各个社的具体条件从有利于生产和社员生活来考虑，而是事事强调集中，样样追求“高级”，把社员家庭经营的小型副业都集中到合作社里统一经营，有的甚至把各家养的鸡鸭都收拢归公。有些合作社虽不过分强调集中，但是不给社员从事家庭副业的时间，不帮助社员克服经营副业的困难。
    社员经营家庭副业，是不是一定会影响社里的集体生产呢？评论里介绍了黄陂县祁站乡星火农业生产合作社的经验，这个社的干部首先根据社里现有的条件，从有利于生产出发，把社里统一经营的和社员家庭经营的副业作了统一规划，接着又从原料、销路、资金、设备、技术等方面通盘考虑，帮助社员制定了家庭副业生产计划。这样，就避免了社员经营家庭副业的盲目性，克服了社员分散经营和社里统一经营的矛盾。评论指出：只要把社员家庭副业安排妥当，不但不会影响集体生产，而且能更充分地利用农民劳动的空隙时间，提高劳动力的利用率。社员家庭副业搞好了，手头零花钱活了，会更爱社，更积极地生产。
