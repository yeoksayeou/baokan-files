The City of Olive Trees

Florence can be called a city of olive trees. The hills in the suburbs are covered with olive trees, and olive oil is a famous product here.

From Piazzale Michelangelo on a small hill in the suburbs, you can overlook Florence. The square tower of the Palazzo Vecchio and the dome of the Basilica di San Lorenzo complement each other. Near San Lorenzo are the tombs of many famous Florentines. The famous opera composer Rossini is buried in the church's crypt.

But the most famous tomb is that of the Medici family. Each generation of this wealthy noble family prepared beautiful tomb sculptures for themselves during their lifetime. Michelangelo's famous four large sculptures called Dawn, Noon, Dusk, and Night are the decorations of this tomb.

As we walked down the mountain, everyone broke off a small olive branch as a souvenir of visiting this city of olive trees. The Palazzo Vecchio in Florence.

Florence is also a city full of historical sites and scenic spots. When we arrived in this city, the World Conference of Capital City Mayors had just been held here. This was a conference calling for peace and defending culture. Representatives from many countries such as the Soviet Union, China, the United States, Britain, and France attended. This conference received support from all sides and was especially supported by the Italian people.

Florence has a population of over 400,000, of whom 130,000 are Communist Party members. In this war-torn region and famous place where cultural relics gather, people have a deeper understanding of the significance of opposing war and defending culture.

The city government is located in the famous Palazzo Vecchio, a palace-fortress that began construction in 1299. The high fortress has beautiful battlements, and the square tower adds to the majesty of this small palace-fortress. Inside this palace-fortress, there are sculptures and murals everywhere, the most famous of which is Michelangelo's "Victory." Outside the palace-fortress is the famous "White Giant" fountain.

Mayor La Pira warmly received the Chinese artists in the hall of this palace-fortress. Mayor La Pira is a member of the Christian Democratic Party. When the Florence City Council initiated the World Conference of Capital City Mayors, he was the gracious host of this conference. Many Italian friends told us: "The Italian people understand best what war is, and therefore oppose war the most. Because every Italian has suffered different hardships in the war. Therefore, people with different political views often have a common language on the point of advocating peace." (Picture attached)

    橄榄树的城市
    佛罗伦萨可以说是个橄榄树的城市，市郊的山上，到处都是橄榄树，橄榄油是这里的名产。
    从市郊小山上的米盖朗基罗广场可以俯瞰佛罗伦萨。维齐欧宫堡的方塔和圣玛利堂的圆顶相映成趣。在圣玛利堂附近，是许多佛罗伦萨的名人墓地，像著名的歌剧家罗西尼便长眠在教堂的墓室里。
    但最有名的墓室是梅迪齐家族的，这个富有的爵爷家族的每一代都在生前便为自己准备着美丽的墓室的雕刻。伟大的米盖朗基罗的著名的四个大雕像叫做：黎明、中午、黄昏、夜晚的，便是这个墓室的装饰。
    我们从山上走下来，每个人都折了一小枝橄榄，作为游览这个橄榄树的城市的纪念。佛罗伦萨的维齐欧宫
    佛罗伦萨也是个到处都是古迹名胜的城市。当我们到这个城市的时候，世界各国首都市长会议刚刚在这里举行，这是个号召和平、保卫文化的会议，苏、中、美、英、法……许多国家的代表都到会了。这个会议得到了各方面的支持，更受到意大利人民的拥护。
    佛罗伦萨有四十多万人口，其中共产党员达十三万人。在这个经过战祸的地区和文物荟聚的名胜之地，人们更深切地了解反对战争、保卫文化的意义。
    市政府设在著名的维齐欧宫，这是从1299年开始建造的一个宫堡，高高的堡垒上有着美丽的城垛，方形的高塔使这个不大的宫堡增加了威严。在这个宫堡里，到处都是雕刻和壁画，其中最著名的是米盖朗基罗的“胜利”。在宫堡的外面，是著名的“白巨人”喷泉。
    市长拉·皮拉先生在这个宫堡的大厅中亲切地招待了中国的艺术家们。市长先生是天主教民主党党员，在佛罗伦萨市议会发起举行世界首都市长会议时，他是这个会议的殷勤的主人。许多意大利朋友告诉我们：“意大利人民最了解甚么是战争，因而也最反对战争。因为每个意大利人都在战争中吃过不同的苦头。所以，在政治上不同见解的人们，常常在主张和平这一点上有着共同的语言”。（附图片）
