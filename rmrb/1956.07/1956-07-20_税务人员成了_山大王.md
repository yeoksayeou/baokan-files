　　Tax Officials Become "Mountain Bandits"
　　Lin County, Henan Province, is a mountainous area with a large population and little land. Sideline occupations are a major source of income for farmers. However, in the past two years, especially since this spring, many sideline occupations have come to a standstill. There are many reasons why farmers no longer engage in sideline occupations, one of which is that they cannot bear the abusive taxation and fines imposed by tax officials. Members of the Ma Ping Village Agricultural Cooperative earn two yuan each time they haul coal during the agricultural off-season, which should not be subject to tax. However, tax officials demanded that they pay the full year's tax. Farmer Fu San even sold his coal sacks to pay the tax. In Xingjiayao Village, half of the nineteen households engage in sideline production of firing jars and earthenware basins. Tax cadres demanded that they pay taxes retroactively from 1954 and also imposed a fine of one hundred yuan. As a result, the village's kiln industry collapsed, and the masses in the surrounding villages dared not engage in sideline occupations. According to current investigations, in 1955, the Lin County Tax Bureau made more than 200 cases of erroneous taxation, amounting to 8,300 yuan. In just over four months of 1956, the erroneous taxation reached 8,809 yuan. Tax officials not only arbitrarily levy taxes and fines but also arbitrarily order taxpayers to go to the district to "reflect." Some farmers, upon hearing that tax officials are coming, hide in the fields all day, afraid to go home. Some farmers call certain tax cadres "little bandits" or "mountain bandits."
　　Since 1953, the Director of the Lin County Tax Bureau has been a member of the County Party Committee. Recently, the Lin County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party convened a Party Congress. Representatives raised many opinions to the Director of the Tax Bureau, and coupled with other issues, the Director of the Tax Bureau did not make a sufficient self-criticism. Therefore, during this re-election of County Party Committee members, the Director of the Tax Bureau was not re-elected. The tax work in Lin County is currently being rectified. (Han Wenming)

### 税务人员成了“山大王”

    税务人员成了“山大王”
    河南省林县是一个人多地少的山区，副业是农民的一项主要收入。可是近二年来，特别是今年春天以来，许多副业都停顿了。农民不再经营副业的原因很多，其中一个原因是受不了税务工作人员的滥征滥罚。马平村农业合作社的社员利用农闲去驮煤，驮一次赚二元钱，本不该出税，但税务人员却叫他们补全年的税。农民傅三为了补税把装煤的口袋都卖了。邢家窑村有十九户人家，有半数人家以烧缸、烧瓦盆作为副业生产，税务干部要他们从1954年补税，还罚款一百元。这个村的窑业生产因此垮台了，周围村庄的群众也不敢经营副业了。据现在查明，1955年，林县税务局错征事件共二百多起，错征的款有八千三百元。1956年四个多月就错征了八千八百零九元。税务人员不仅随便征税、随便罚款，还随便叫出税人到区上去“反省”。有的农民听说税务人员来了，跑到地里一天不敢回家。有的农民叫某税收干部是“小响马”、“山大王”。
    从1953年起，林县的税务局长就是县委委员。最近，中共林县县委召开了党代表大会，代表们向税务局长提了很多意见，加上其他问题，税务局长又检讨不够，因此，在这次改选县委委员的时候，税务局长落选了。林县的税务工作，正在加以整顿。　（韩文明）
