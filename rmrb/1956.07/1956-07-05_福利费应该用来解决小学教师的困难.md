To the Editor:

    Not long ago, we conducted an inspection of the use of welfare funds for primary school teachers and staff in the Beilin, Xincheng, Afang, and Lianhu districts of Xi'an City and found that the backlog of welfare funds was very serious. In 1955, less than 20% of the welfare funds allocated by the Municipal People's Committee to teachers and staff in these four districts were actually used for the whole year.

    Is it because the primary school teachers and staff in these districts are living very well and have no difficulties, thus no subsidies are needed? No. At present, the salary and benefits of primary school teachers and staff are not high, and many primary school teachers and staff have relatively heavy family burdens and often encounter difficulties in life. For example, at Leishenmiao Primary School in Lianhu District, 27% of the teachers and staff need subsidies, but no one received any welfare subsidies in 1955. Yang Kechang, a teacher at Ziqiang Road Primary School in Weiyang District, applied for a subsidy from the district because his wife contracted lung disease and incurred medical expenses, which caused financial difficulties for his family. However, the district leaders retorted, "This person's potential has not been fully tapped, so there is no need to give him a subsidy; besides, his family is of middle peasant background, so he can ask his family for money." The head of the district's Culture and Education Section clearly knew that Yang Kechang should be entitled to a subsidy, but irresponsibly said, "The district head won't approve it, so there's nothing I can do!" Fu Baiyin, a primary school teacher, earns a monthly salary of twenty-eight yuan, and his father is blind and unable to work. Principal Shi Shukuai applied to the district's Culture and Education Section for a subsidy of thirty yuan on his behalf. However, the head of the Culture and Education Section said, "He didn't ask for a subsidy, so why should we give him one?" As a result, after much persuasion, only fifteen yuan was approved.

    Welfare funds are used to help primary school teachers and staff solve their difficulties. However, the leading organs in charge of welfare funds do not care about the hardships of primary school teachers and staff, so people in need cannot get subsidies, while large amounts of welfare funds are accumulated. This is an abnormal phenomenon! It should be changed immediately.

### 福利费应该用来解决小学教师的困难

    福利费应该用来解决小学教师的困难
    编辑同志：
    不久以前，我们曾经对西安市的碑林、新城、阿房、莲湖等区的小学教职员福利费使用情况进行了一次检查，发现积压福利费的现象很严重。1955年市人民委员会拨给这四个区的教职员福利费全年只用了不到20％。
    是不是这些区里小学教职员的生活很好，没有什么困难，因而不需要补助呢？不是的。目前小学教职员的薪金待遇还不算高，不少小学教职员家庭负担比较重，生活中经常会碰到一些困难。像莲湖区雷神庙小学就有27％的教职员需要补助，但是1955年一个人也没有领到福利补助费。未央区自强路小学教师杨克昌因为爱人得了肺病，用了一笔医疗费，家庭生活发生了困难，就向区上申请补助。区的领导同志反说“这个人的潜力还没有挖完，不需要给予补助；同时他家是中农成分，他可以向家里要钱。”区文教科科长明明知道杨克昌应该享受补助，但是却不负责任地说：“区长不批，咱也不好办！”小学教师傅百银月薪二十八元，父亲双目失明，不能劳动，校长石树奎就替他向区文教科提出申请补助三十元。文教科长却说：“人家没有要求补助，咱为什么一定要给他补助呢？”结果说好说歹，只批了十五元。
    福利费是用来帮助小学教职员解决困难的。但是掌握福利费的领导机关却不关心小学教职员的疾苦，使有困难的人得不到补助，而大批福利费却积压了下来。这是一种不正常的现象！应该立刻得到改变。
