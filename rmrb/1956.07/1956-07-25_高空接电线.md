High-Altitude Electrical Wire Connection
Zhang Tiesheng

That night, the wind was strong. Master Song got up several times to peek at the wind through the curtains, worried about the old high-altitude electrical wires in the factory. By four o'clock in the morning, the wind was picking up. Master Song thought to himself, "With such a strong wind, something's bound to go wrong. If the wires break, the power will go out, and all the machines will stop..." He quickly got out of bed and put on his clothes. Just as he stepped out the door, he heard someone calling him. It was his female apprentice, Qingqin, who was also coming from across the hall.

"Are you going to the factory?"

"Yes, are you too? Did you bring a flashlight?"

"Yes, I did. I can't sleep when the wind is so strong. Do you think it will break?"

Master Song said, "It's hard to say."

The wind blew sand and dirt, stinging their faces, making it hard to open their eyes or breathe. The master and apprentice held onto each other, stumbling and falling until they reached the factory. They quickly organized their gear and tools, and then, with flashlights in hand, went to inspect the electrical wires.

The high-altitude wires swayed back and forth in the wind, making a "铮铮咚咚" sound. Suddenly, with a "啪" sound, a wire in front of them came down. Qingqin ran over, took a look, and called out loudly, "The wire on pole number 21 is broken!" Master Song ran over to inspect the broken end and said, "Let's get to work immediately." Qingqin was about to climb up, but Master Song stopped her and said, "I'll go." With that, he skillfully climbed up the pole.

When Master Song came down, Qingqin stepped forward to support him, saying, "Master Song, I have a request: Let me go up next time! You're getting old, you can rest and give instructions from below."

"Qingqin, this isn't something to joke about. It's not that I don't want you to go, but it requires not only courage, but also attention to detail, not only skill, but also experience. You could fall. You're just a seventeen or eighteen-year-old girl, you've only been here for a few months..."

Before he could finish, Qingqin interrupted:

"Good Master, don't worry, although I lack experience, you've taught me everything, and I practice often. I'm young and strong, even if I fall or get a little shock, it won't matter. Just let me go!"

As Qingqin spoke, she tossed her head, and her two braids swung behind her shoulders. Master Song smiled as he looked at her.

"This girl! Go ahead then, but don't come crying to me if you fall!"

At this moment, Master Li from the same shift also arrived. All three had flashlights, so they agreed to split up and check the wires. Qingqin ran to a distant spot and discovered a large wire that was about to break. She quickly shouted:

"Come and see, there's a problem here!"

The two ran over and looked for a while. Master Li said, "This wire is difficult to handle, it's hanging in mid-air, there's nowhere to stand." The two quickly discussed it. Master Song went to turn off the power, Master Li went to fetch a tall ladder, and Qingqin stayed to watch.

Before long, Master Li brought the tall ladder. Qingqin moved to climb up, but Master Li stopped her and said, "This is dangerous, you can't go up, let me do it." Qingqin quickly grabbed a rung and said, "Don't worry, Master Song has already agreed to let me go up, I guarantee there won't be any accidents." Qingqin skillfully climbed up. Master Song had returned by this time and saw Qingqin already standing on the highest rung, he was so anxious that he cupped his hands to his mouth and shouted upwards, "Be careful!"

Qingqin quickly connected the wires with both hands. A gust of wind blew fiercely, causing her to sway back and forth. Qingqin thought to herself, "Oh my, why am I so useless, I need to connect the wire quickly!" The two masters below hurriedly hugged the base of the ladder tightly, shouting upwards, "Be careful." Before long, Qingqin shouted, "It's connected, I'm coming down!" Both masters were covered in sweat and felt relieved.

Qingqin came down safely, and Master Li grabbed her and said, "You're a good girl, I admire you!" Master Song was even happier, but he said, "Don't praise her yet, we have to see if it's connected properly." With that, he climbed up. Qingqin and Master Li quickly held the base of the ladder.

Master Song also came down safely. Master Li asked, "Is it okay?" Master Song couldn't help but smile with joy and said, "It's okay!" Master Li, while putting away the ladder, said, "Old Song, this apprentice of yours has really made you proud!" Master Song said, "Don't praise her, you'll spoil her." Qingqin stood aside, so excited she couldn't close her mouth, and said, "Let's go look elsewhere."

    高空接电线
    张铁生
    这一夜刮大风。宋师傅好几回起床撩开窗帘看风势，心里惦念厂里有些残旧的高空架线电线。到早晨四点钟，风一阵阵大起来。宋师傅心里盘算：“这么大风非出岔子不可，要是电线断了，电就停了，机器也都得停……”他赶忙下床穿衣。刚跨出门，忽听有人叫他，原来是女徒工青芹，也正从对门走来。
    “您是上工厂去的吧？”
    “是啊，你也是的吧？带手电筒了吗？”
    “带啦。一刮大风我就睡不着了，您说会刮断吗？”
    宋师傅说：“可说不定。”
    大风刮起砂土，打得脸生疼，眼也睁不开，气也透不转。师徒两人牵拉着，跌跌绊绊到了厂里，忙整理好全身佩带和工具，就拿着手电筒查看电线。
    高空横架着的一根根电线，被风吹得摇来晃去，发出“铮铮咚咚”的声音。忽然“啪”的一声，前面一根电线挂了下来。青芹急忙跑去，看了一下，回头高声叫道：“是21号线杆的电线刮断啦！”宋师傅跑来一查看断头，说：“马上动手接。”青芹正要爬上去，宋师傅拦住说：“我去。”说着，就熟练地爬上杆子。
    等宋师傅下来，青芹上前扶着，说：“宋师傅，我提个要求：下回让我上吧！您老人家在下面歇歇力，指点指点就行。”
    “青芹呀，这可不是闹着玩的事，不是我不让你上，这不但要胆大，还得心细，不但要技术，还要经验，弄不好就会摔下来。你十七、八岁的女孩子家，才来几个月……”
    话没说完，青芹抢着说了：
    “好师傅，您放心吧，我虽然经验不足，可您平常都教过，我也常练习，我年轻力壮，即便摔下来或碰着点也不打紧，您就让我上吧！”
    青芹说着，把头一摆，两条辫子甩到了肩后。宋师傅瞅着笑了。
    “这闺女！上就上吧，可摔下来就算不了什么好汉啦！”
    这时，同班的李师傅也赶来了。三人都有电筒，就相约着分头查看。青芹跑到远处，发现上面一根大线将断未断，连忙喊：
    “你们来看，这里有问题哩！”
    两人跑过来看了一会，李师傅说：“这线难弄哩，正悬在半空，没处立脚。”两人急急商量了一下，宋师傅去拉电闸，李师傅去搬高梯子，留青芹看守。
    不大功夫，李师傅搬来了高梯子。青芹抽身要上，李师傅拦住说：“这危险呀，你可不能上，让我来。”青芹急忙抢上一级，说：“您放心，宋师傅已经答应我上了，保证不出差儿。”青芹灵巧地上去了。宋师傅这时也回来了，见青芹已站在最高级，急得用手卷成喇叭式朝上喊道：“要小心啊！”
    青芹两只手迅速地接线。一阵狂风猛劲刮来，刮得她来回直摇晃。青芹心里说：“妈呀，我怎的这么不中用，快接好线！”下面两位师傅慌忙使劲抱着梯脚，朝上连喊
  “小心”。不多会儿，青芹喊道：“接好啦，我要下来啦！”两位师傅都出了一身汗，心里才轻松些。
    青芹安稳地下来了，李师傅一把拉住说：“真是好闺女呀，我佩服你呀！”宋师傅心里更高兴，但却说：“且慢夸她，得去看看接得怎样。”说着上去了。青芹和李师傅忙把着梯脚。
    宋师傅也安稳地下来了，李师傅问：“没错儿吧？”宋师傅止不住心里喜欢，笑着说：“行吧！”李师傅一面收拾梯子，一面说：“老宋，你这徒弟可给你露脸啦！”宋师傅说：“别夸啦，夸坏了她。”青芹在一旁兴奋得合不拢嘴，说：“再看看别处去吧。”
