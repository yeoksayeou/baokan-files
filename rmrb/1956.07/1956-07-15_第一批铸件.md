The first batch of casting blanks from the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant was cast by the plant's last completed workshop – the Foundry Workshop. By the end of June, nearly 40,000 blanks had been put into storage.

When people mention iron casting, the image that naturally comes to mind is one of smoke and dust everywhere, sparks flying, and summer indoor temperatures often unbearably high... But the Foundry Workshop of the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant is completely different.

This is a "mountain"-shaped factory building. This type of factory building is not only convenient for air intake and exhaust, but also has ample light, as bright and clean as a school classroom. This workshop was designed by Soviet experts using the latest achievements of modern science, and it has highly mechanized and automated equipment. From material transportation to furnace loading, from sand mixing to mold making, from casting to waste disposal, everything is automated, and even the ventilation equipment is automatic. In winter, the intake pipe automatically sends warm air, and in summer, it blows out cool air with mist-like small water droplets, while unclean air is discharged from the factory through the exhaust pipe. Here, machinery replaces heavy physical labor, and workers can control the entire complex conveyor belt from just two interlocked control rooms. Standing in front of the conveyor belt, you will see that when the casting sandboxes slowly move to the sand-falling grid, they are pushed inside by an automatic push rod at the touch of a switch. At this time, the sand-falling grid begins to vibrate rhythmically, and the sand and castings are respectively sent to different places by the conveyor belt. It looks very orderly and interesting.

Because all the main equipment is linked, installation was very difficult. It is said that such a difficult and complex project would take a year to install even in the Soviet Union. With the help of Soviet experts, the First Electromechanical Installation Company of the First Ministry of Machine Building Industry and the employees of the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant completed it in just one year. In order to produce cars as early as possible, the date for putting the Foundry Workshop into production and adjustment was repeatedly advanced. Approximately 25% of the weight of the "Liberation" brand automobile consists of castings, and the Foundry Workshop's early production of a large number of casting blanks greatly helped the production of major workshops such as the engine, chassis, and gearbox.

On the eve of the first molten iron coming out of the four or five-story-high cupola, the foundry workshop was as tense as a battlefield. There were twelve construction units at the time. There were more than seventy conveyor belts that needed to be glued together, which was a huge project. The workshop, the installation company, and the state-owned No. 8 Rubber Factory and other units adopted a流水作业 (literally: assembly line operation) method, dividing the work and taking responsibility for a concentrated attack on this task. Everyone proposed: never let the previous process accumulate, and the next process should wait for work. In this way, more than sixty main conveyor belts were glued in more than twenty days. The employees said: Things that seemed impossible were actually accomplished, it's a miracle! 71% of the equipment in the Foundry Workshop was manufactured by domestic factories. Because of the short time, urgent tasks, and high technical requirements, there were great difficulties in manufacturing. All factories actively contributed their strength. When Chongqing Machine Tool Factory was making molding machines for the Foundry Workshop, because the quality requirements were very strict, the leading comrades personally took charge and dispatched the factory's best technicians to carry out assembly. They said: The automobile factory is a large-scale assembly line production, and we must not let the main assembly line stop turning because of the poor quality of our products. Tianjin Textile Machinery Factory almost ran all over the country to find materials for making foundry conveyor belts. The conveyor belts they manufactured have not had any problems in operation for three months. More than twenty factories across the country have worked hard to support the Foundry Workshop of the Automobile Factory.

The first batch of castings has been born. The processed parts have been assembled into assemblies and will be assembled on the first batch of automobiles. The 143 types of gray iron and malleable castings required by the "Liberation" brand automobile will be continuously transported by this workshop to the seven major basic production workshops such as the engine, chassis, and gearbox, to ensure the rhythmic production of high-quality automobiles.

    第一批铸件
    黄洁民
    第一汽车制造厂的第一批铸件毛坯，由这个厂最后建成的车间——铸工车间铸造出来了。到六月底止，已经有近四万件毛坯入库。
    一提起翻砂铸铁的地方，人们的脑子里很自然地会浮现出这样一幅景象：到处是烟尘弥漫，火花四迸，夏天室内温度常高到使人难以忍受的程度……。但是第一汽车制造厂的铸工车间却完全是另外一个样子。
    这是一个“山”字形的厂房。这种厂房不但进气排气方便，而且光线充足，像学校教室一样明亮、清洁。这个车间是苏联专家利用现代科学的新成就设计的，拥有高度机械化和自动化的设备。从运料到装炉，从配沙到制型，从浇注铸件到清理废物，全部是自动化的，甚至通风设备也是自动装置。冬天进气管自动送来暖气，夏天它又吹出带有雾状小水珠的凉风，不洁的空气由排气管排出厂房。在这里，机械代替了笨重的体力劳动，工人只在两个连锁控制室里就可以控制整个复杂的运输带。你站在输送带面前就会看到，当铸件沙箱缓缓走到落沙栅的时候，一碰到开关，就由自动推杆推到里边。这时，落沙栅开始有节奏地振动，沙和铸件就分别由输送带送到不同的地方。看来非常有秩序，也非常有趣。
    正因为全部主要设备是联动的，所以安装起来非常困难。据说，像这样艰巨、复杂的工程，就是在苏联，安装也需要一年工夫。第一机械工业部第一机电安装公司和第一汽车制造厂的职工，在苏联专家的帮助下，也仅用一年的时间就完成了。为了提早生产出汽车，铸工车间投入生产调整的日期一再提前。“解放”牌汽车本身重量的25％左右是铸件，铸工车间提前生产出大批铸件毛坯，对发动机、底盘、变速箱等主要车间的生产有很大帮助。
    在四五层楼高的冲天炉出第一炉铁水的前夕，铸工场真像战场一样紧张。施工单位就有十二个。当时有七十多条运输带需要胶合在一起，这是个巨大的工程。车间、安装公司和国营橡胶第八厂等单位采取流水作业的方法，分工负责来突击这一任务。大家提出：决不让上道工序积压，下道工序等活。这样，二十多天就胶合了六十多根主要的运输带。职工们说：眼看不能作到的事，竟然作到了，真是奇迹！铸工车间有71％的设备是国内各厂承制的。因为时间短，任务急，技术要求高，制造中有很大困难。各厂都积极贡献出了自己的力量。重庆机床厂给铸工车间做造型机的时候，因为质量要求很严，领导同志亲自掌握，派全厂技术最好的技师进行装配。他们说：汽车厂是大流水生产，决不能让它因为我们的产品质量不好而使总装配线停止转动。天津纺织机械厂为了作铸工输送带，几乎跑遍全国去找材料。他们制造的输送带，运转三个月以来没有出过毛病。全国有二十多个厂为支援汽车厂铸工车间付出了辛勤的劳动。
    第一批铸件已经诞生了。加工出来的零件已经装出总成，就要装配在第一批汽车上。“解放”牌汽车所需要的143种灰口和可锻铸件，将由这个车间源源不断地输送到发动机、底盘、变速箱等七个主要的基本生产车间，保证有节奏地生产出质量优良的汽车来。
