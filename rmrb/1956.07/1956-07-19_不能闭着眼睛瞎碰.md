    You Can't Just Stumble Around Blindly

    On July 16th, the Guangxi Daily published an editorial entitled "Improve Our Leadership Style," pointing out to some agricultural cooperative cadres who do not proceed from reality in their work: there is no way to avoid failure if you just stumble around blindly.

    After Guangxi Province achieved advanced collectivization, some agricultural cooperative cadres believed that since such a complex and arduous undertaking as socialist transformation had been victorious, how could it be difficult to lead production, such a "simple" task! Therefore, they no longer delved into the masses, but made "decisions" based solely on subjective wishes. This spring, some relatively dry areas in the province adopted the method of "dry sowing and seedling cultivation," which could prevent rotten seedlings and resist drought. As a result, some people, regardless of the differences in region and soil quality, and disregarding the opposition of the masses, insisted on promoting it 100% in agricultural cooperatives with only clay soil fields. As a result, because the soil was not loose enough and labor was wasted, the seedlings were worse than those cultivated by "wet sowing," causing dissatisfaction among the members.

    The editorial also said that setting production plans was also based on subjective wishes, believing that the higher the targets, the better, and increasing them at each level. Some plans even increased by more than 300% compared to last year. They believed that higher plans were "harmless," and even if only half of them were completed, production would still increase compared to last year. In this way, the plan lost its guiding role, contracting production became impossible, and the members' confidence in increasing production was undermined.

    The editorial concluded: No matter what work you do, you must look at the objective conditions, what are the positive and negative factors; then look at the subjective conditions, what are the advantages or difficulties, and then you can draw a conclusion on whether to do this thing and how to do it. There is no way to avoid failure if you just stumble around blindly. (Xinhua News Agency)

    不能闭着眼睛瞎碰
    七月十六日，广西日报发表了“改进我们的领导作风”的社论，向某些做工作不从实际出发的农业社干部指出：闭着眼睛瞎碰是没有不失败的。
    广西省实现高级合作化后，有些农业社干部就认为：像社会主义改造这样复杂艰巨的事业都已取得胜利，难道领导生产这样“简单”的工作还不好办！于是他们就不再深入群众，单凭主观愿望来做“决定”了。今年春天省内某些比较干旱地区采用了“旱播育秧”的方法，既可防止烂秧，又能抗旱。于是有些人不管地区、土质的不同，不顾群众的反对，硬要在只有粘土田的农业社里，百分之百的推广。结果因为泥土不够松碎、劳动力又浪费，秧苗反比“水播育秧”差，引起社员不满。
    社论又说，对订生产计划也是按主观愿望办事，认为指标越高越好，层层加大。甚至有的计划比去年增为300％以上。他们认为计划偏高“没有害处”，即使完成一半，也比去年增产。这样计划失去指导作用，包产包不下去，挫伤了社员增产的信心。
    社论最后指出：不论做什么工作，都要看看客观条件，有哪些积极因素和消极因素；再看看主观条件，有哪些优点或困难，然后才能得出要不要做这件事和如何做这件事的结论，闭着眼睛瞎碰是没有不失败的。　　　　　　（新华社）
