    West German Magazine Points Out
    Western Countries Lack Experts
    Xinhua News Agency, Berlin dispatch: According to TASS, the West German magazine "Economist" published an article saying that in recent years, Western governments have become increasingly worried about the lack of technical experts, especially engineers. Last year, Britain was short of 10,000 engineers, but only 3,000 could be filled. West Germany is currently short of about 40,000 engineers. The main reason for this situation is that colleges and universities do not train enough experts in various industrial sectors.
    The magazine pointed out that Western countries have fallen far behind the Soviet Union in training experts. In 1955, Soviet colleges and universities trained 50,000 more engineers than the United States in the same year.

    西德一杂志指出
    西方各国缺乏专家
    新华社讯　据塔斯社柏林讯：西德“经济学家”杂志发表文章说，近年来，西方各国政府因为缺乏技术专家首先是工程师，而愈来愈担忧。去年，英国一共缺少一万名工程师，但是能够补缺的只有三千名。西德目前约缺少四万名工程师。造成这种状况的主要原因是高等学校培养各工业部门专家的名额不够。
    这家杂志指出西方各国在培养专家方面已经远远落在苏联的后面。1955年苏联高等学校培养出来的工程师比美国同年所培养的多五万名。
