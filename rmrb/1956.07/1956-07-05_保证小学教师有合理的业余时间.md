    Guarantee Reasonable Leisure Time for Primary School Teachers
    To the Editor:
    I am a primary school teacher from Taiping Temple Complete Primary School in Hefu District, Changde County, Hunan Province. I want to appeal to you: the burden on rural primary school teachers is too heavy. We bear more than twenty hours of classes per week. Adding preparation, grading homework, and providing individual education to children, we are already working very intensely every day. However, there are countless meetings at the school, such as life meetings, school affairs meetings, administrative meetings, class teacher meetings, counselor meetings, various subject research meetings, and trade union group meetings. We spend a lot of time in meetings, but few problems are solved in the meetings. Not to mention that rural primary school teachers also have excessive social activities, and sometimes are even transferred in batches to do central work. Among these social activities, some are that we should participate in, such as literacy campaigns and necessary propaganda and mobilization work, which we are also happy to participate in. But there are many social activities that should not be added to us, such as agricultural production cooperatives asking for the collection of membership shares, and repairing dikes and dams, all grabbing us for errands. There are too many such social activities at present, averaging more than an hour of our time every day. In addition, we have to take Party history classes on Sunday mornings, and sometimes have meetings on Sunday afternoons. Under these circumstances, we have very little leisure time. Not to mention the inability to ensure further studies, we can't even find time to write letters or wash clothes. Some teachers sleep less than six hours a day, and their health is very poor.
    Our primary school teachers have many opinions on this busy phenomenon in their work, and some even feel uneasy about their work because of it. Editor, this is a big problem concerning the vast number of rural primary school educators. I hope you will bring it up and ask the leading organs in various places to pay attention to solving it.

专栏：

    保证小学教师有合理的业余时间
    编辑同志：
    我是湖南省常德县河洑区太平寺完全小学校的一个小学教师。我要向你们呼吁：农村小学教师的负担太重了。我们每周担负着二十小时以上的课程，加上备课、批改作业、对儿童进行个别教育等，每天工作已经很紧张了。但是，学校里还有数不清的会议，像生活会、校务会、行政会、班主任会、辅导员会、各种科目的研究会和工会小组会等。我们花在开会上的时间很多，而在会议上解决的问题却不多。这还不说，农村小学教师还有着过多的社会活动，有时甚至被成批地调去做中心工作。在这些社会活动中，有些是我们应该参加的，像扫盲和必要的宣传鼓动工作等等，我们也很乐意参加。但是有许多社会活动实在不应该加在我们身上，像农业生产合作社要催交入社股份基金，要修堤修坝，都来抓我们的差。目前这样的社会活动实在太多了，平均每天都得使我们花去一个多小时的时间。此外，我们在星期日上午要上党史课，在星期日下午有时还要开会。在这种情况下，我们业余时间很少，不要说无法保证进修，连写信、洗衣服都找不到时间。有些教师每天睡眠时间不到六小时，健康情况很坏。
    我们小学教师对工作中的这种忙乱现象都有很多的意见，有些人甚至因而不安心于自己的工作。编辑同志，这是有关广大农村小学教育工作者的一个大问题，希望你们提出来请各地领导机关注意解决。
