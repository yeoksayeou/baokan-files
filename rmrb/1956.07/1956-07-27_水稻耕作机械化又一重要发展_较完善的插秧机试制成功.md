Another Important Development in Mechanized Rice Farming
Relatively Complete Rice Transplanter Successfully Trial-Produced

(Our Dispatch) A draft animal-powered rice transplanter with a relatively complete design was tested for rice transplanting in the suburbs of Nanjing on July 23rd, with very good results. This is another important development in the mechanization of paddy field cultivation following the successful modification of paddy field tractors by the Zhongshan Agricultural Machinery and Tractor Station in Guangdong Province.

This six-row transplanter is operated by one person and pulled by one person leading the cattle. As it moves forward, the seedling box moves laterally, and the six claws on the transplanting wheel alternately grab the seedlings and insert them into the field. The transplanter integrates the actions of sending seedlings, dividing seedlings, and transplanting into a whole. Using this rice transplanter, approximately 30 mu can be transplanted in one day, which is about 30 times more efficient than manual transplanting. The depth and spacing of the seedlings transplanted by the machine are as uniform as those transplanted by hand, and the quality is comparable to that of manual transplanting. According to statistics, the seedling damage rate is currently 7% to 9%, and the missed transplanting rate is 6% to 11.3%.

The design and trial production of this rice transplanter were decided at the National Rice Transplanter Experiment Symposium convened by the Ministry of Agriculture in Wuchang in April this year. Under the leadership of the Ministry of Agriculture and the Jiangsu Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, twelve agricultural scientific researchers from the East China Agricultural Science Research Institute and the Central China Agricultural Science Research Institute, Hunan Agricultural Machinery Factory, Nanjing Institute of Technology, Nanjing Agricultural College, Nanjing Agricultural Mechanization School, and Jiangsu Provincial Department of Agriculture, specially formed a rice transplanter research group to carry out the design and trial production research of rice transplanters. Based on the rice transplanter previously trial-produced by the East China Agricultural Science Research Institute, and referring to 20 or 30 relevant inventions and creations and the opinions of the masses, they finally successfully trial-produced this transplanter.

The successful trial production of the rice transplanter will greatly relieve the heavy and intense physical labor of farmers who plant rice, enabling farmers to overcome the difficulty of being busy with both transplanting and harvesting during the summer harvest and planting season; it will also powerfully promote the technical reform of changing single-cropping rice to double-cropping. Using machines to replace manual transplanting is a common demand of farmers. In recent years, the East China Agricultural Science Research Institute has received hundreds of letters from the masses on this issue.

Zhou Taichu, deputy director of the food crop department of the East China Agricultural Science Research Institute, excitedly told reporters: In the past, people in Japan, Italy, and France have conducted research in this area for many years, and it is said that the problems of automatic seedling sending, seedling dividing, and transplanting have not been completely solved. It is impossible not to be excited that Chinese agricultural scientific workers have successfully solved a series of technical problems in rice transplanters in just over a year.

At present, this rice transplanter has not yet reached perfection. For example, during transplanting, there is floating mud accumulating beside the machine, making it difficult to maintain straight rows, and there are also shortcomings such as floating seedlings, seedling damage, and missed transplanting. The transplanter research group is further studying and improving these shortcomings. (Attached picture)

### 水稻耕作机械化又一重要发展  较完善的插秧机试制成功

    水稻耕作机械化又一重要发展 
    较完善的插秧机试制成功
    本报讯　一部设计较为完善的畜力水稻插秧机，七月二十三日在南京市郊试验插秧，效果很好。这是继广东省中山农业机器拖拉机站改装成功水田用的拖拉机之后的水田耕作机械化的又一重要发展。
    这部六行插秧机由一人操纵，一人赶牛牵引。在它前进的时候，秧箱横向移动，插秧轮盘上的六个分爪，轮番地抓住秧苗，插入田中。插秧机把送秧、分秧、插秧等动作联成了一个整体。用这部水稻插秧机插秧，一天大约可以插三十亩，比人工插秧效率大约高三十倍。机器插的秧苗的深度、株距和手插的一样均匀，并和人工插秧的质量不相上下。据统计，目前它的伤秧率为7％到9％，漏插率为6％到11.3％。
    这部水稻插秧机的设计试制，是今年四月间农业部在武昌召开的全国水稻插秧机试验座谈会上决定的。在农业部和中共江苏省委的领导下，华东农业科学研究所和华中农业科学研究所、湖南农业机械厂、南京工学院、南京农学院、南京农业机械化学校、江苏农业厅的十二位农业科学研究工作者，专门成立了插秧机研究组，进行水稻插秧机的设计试制研究工作。他们以华东农业科学研究所过去试制的水稻插秧机为基础，并参考了二三十种有关这方面的创造发明和群众的意见，最后试制成功这架插秧机。
    水稻插秧机的试制成功，将大大地解除种植水稻的农民繁重而紧张的体力劳动，可以使农民能够克服在夏收夏种期间插秧、收获两头忙的困难；还将有力地推动水稻单季改双季的技术改革。用机械代替人力插秧是农民普遍的要求，近年来，华东农业科学研究所收到的有关这一方面的群众来信就有几百封。
    华东农业科学研究所食用作物系副主任周泰初兴奋地告诉记者说：过去，在日本、意大利、法国都曾有人对这方面作过多年研究，据说还没有彻底解决自动送秧、分秧、插秧的问题。中国的农业科学工作者在短短的一年多的时间里，能顺利地解决了水稻插秧机中的一系列的技术问题，不能不令人感到兴奋。
    目前，这部水稻插秧机还没有达到完善的地步，例如在插秧时，机旁壅有浮泥，对行有困难，还有飘棵、伤秧、漏插等缺点。插秧机研究组正在进一步研究改进这些缺点。（附图片）
