Xinhua News Agency, July 20th: According to a Yugoslavian news agency report on the 19th, Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser, Yugoslavian President Josip Broz Tito, and Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru concluded their political talks in Brioni on the evening of July 19th.

It is reported that the joint statement regarding their talks will be simultaneously published in Belgrade, Cairo, and New Delhi on the afternoon of July 20th.

Xinhua News Agency, Prague, July 20th: Belgrade Dispatch: Following the political talks held by Yugoslavian President Tito, Egyptian President Abdel Nasser, and Indian Prime Minister Nehru in Brioni on July 18th and 19th, a joint statement was issued on July 20th.

The joint statement said that the three heads of government exchanged detailed opinions on issues of mutual concern during the talks. They reviewed the developments in the international situation since they met separately twelve months ago. They noted with satisfaction that the consistency of their attitudes towards international problems has led to close cooperation between them, and that the policies pursued by their countries have contributed to some extent to easing international tensions and developing relations between countries on an equal footing.

The three heads of government believe that contact and exchange of views between leaders of countries pursuing different policies should be continued and encouraged, and reaffirm their support for the ten principles governing international relations as stipulated in the Bandung Conference.

They recognize that the current conflicts and tensions in the world lead to fear and anxiety about the present and the future. It is difficult to eliminate such fear and anxiety quickly, and steps must be taken gradually to eliminate it. Every such step contributes to easing tensions and is therefore welcome.

The joint statement then said: The current situation in which the world is divided into powerful groups of countries tends to perpetuate this fear. Peace should be sought not through division, but through collective security aimed at establishing world-scale, through expanding the scope of freedom, and through ending the domination of one country over another.

Progress in disarmament is essential to alleviate the fear of conflict. This progress must first be achieved within the framework of the United Nations, and should simultaneously include atomic and thermonuclear weapons as well as conventional armaments, while also providing for adequate supervision of the implementation of the agreements reached.

Weapons of mass destruction, even explosions for experimental purposes, must be stopped, as these explosions may cause harm to mankind. Fissionable materials must in the future be used only for peaceful purposes, and further use of them for war purposes must be prohibited.

The three heads of government are extremely concerned about full and equal international cooperation in the peaceful use of atomic energy. This cooperation must be conducted within the framework of the United Nations, and all countries must participate in the proposed international institution.

The joint statement then said: Strengthening efforts to accelerate the development of underdeveloped regions of the world is one of the main tasks of establishing lasting and stable peace between nations. In this regard, the heads of government of the three countries recognize the importance of international economic and financial cooperation, and believe that it is necessary and appropriate to establish the proposed United Nations Special Fund for Economic Development and to enable it to function effectively.

During their talks, the three heads of government emphasized the great importance of lifting embargoes and eliminating obstacles that hinder the normal exchange and development of international trade.

The three heads of government believe that Central Europe, the Far East of Asia, and the Middle East between Europe and Asia are three major areas of tension and potential conflict.

The joint statement said: Without the full cooperation of the People's Republic of China, the problems of the Far East cannot be properly resolved. The three heads of government stated that they believe that the People's Republic of China should be represented in the United Nations. They also believe that those countries that have applied for membership in the United Nations and are qualified according to the Charter should be admitted into the United Nations.

The problem of Central Europe is closely related to the German question. This important issue must be resolved in accordance with the wishes of the German people through peaceful negotiations.

In the Middle East, conflicting interests between major powers make the situation more difficult. This issue must be considered realistically, safeguarding legitimate economic interests on the one hand, but based on the freedom of the people concerned as the basis for the solution. The freedom and goodwill of the people of this region are essential not only for freedom but also for safeguarding legitimate economic interests.

The situation in Palestine is a particularly dangerous situation for world peace. In this regard, the three heads of government support the resolutions of the Bandung Conference.

The three heads of government also considered the situation in Algeria, which they believe is not only of great significance, but also requires urgent attention from the perspective of the fundamental rights of the Algerian people and from the perspective of consolidating peace in this region of the world.

They believe that colonial rule is completely inappropriate and harmful to both the rulers and the ruled. Therefore, they must express sympathy for the Algerian people's desire for peace. They recognize that there is a considerable number of people of European descent in Algeria whose interests should be protected, but this should not hinder the recognition of the legitimate rights of the Algerian people.

They warmly support all efforts made to seek a just and peaceful solution, especially in ending the serious conflict in this region and in facilitating negotiations. A ceasefire and negotiations between the parties concerned should lead to a peaceful resolution of this issue.

The joint statement concluded: The three heads of government recognize that the problems of the world cannot all be solved at once, and that efforts must be made patiently and in good faith to seek solutions persistently. However, it is important to make every effort to create an atmosphere of peace and to act in accordance with the basic principles of the United Nations Charter.

    重申支持和平共处原则要求进一步缓和紧张局势
    南、埃、印三国政府首脑发表联合声明
    新华社20日讯　据南斯拉夫通讯社十九日报道，埃及总统阿卜杜勒·纳赛尔、南斯拉夫总统铁托和印度总理尼赫鲁七月十九日傍晚结束了他们在布里俄尼举行的政治会谈。
    据悉，关于他们会谈的联合声明将在七月二十日下午在贝尔格莱德、开罗和新德里同时发表。
    新华社布拉格20日电　贝尔格莱德消息：在南斯拉夫总统铁托、埃及总统阿卜杜勒·纳赛尔和印度总理尼赫鲁七月十八日到十九日在布里俄尼举行了政治会谈后，七月二十日发表了联合声明。
    联合声明说，三国政府首脑在会谈中曾就共同有关的问题详细地交换了意见。他们回顾了自从他们在十二个月以前分别会面以来，国际局势中的发展。他们对于国际问题的态度的一致，导致了他们之间的密切合作，他们满意地注意到，他们的国家所奉行的政策在某种程度上有助于缓和国际紧张局势和发展国家之间以平等为基础的关系。
    三国政府首脑认为应该继续并且鼓励奉行不同政策的各国领袖之间的接触和意见交换，并且重申支持万隆会议规定的指导国际关系的十项原则。
    他们认识到，目前世界上的冲突和紧张局势导致了对目前和将来的恐惧和不安。要迅速地消除这种恐惧和不安是困难的，必须逐步采取步骤来消除这种恐惧和不安。每一个这样的步骤都有助于缓和紧张局势，因此是值得欢迎的。
    联合声明接着说：目前世界分成强有力的国家集团的情况，有使这种恐惧永久存在下去的趋势。不应该通过分裂、而应该通过旨在建立世界规模的集体安全，通过扩大自由范围和结束一个国家对另一个国家的支配来寻求和平。
    在裁军方面取得进展对于减轻对冲突的恐惧是必不可少的。这种进展首先必须在联合国范围内实现，并且应该同时包括原子和热核子武器以及常规军备，同时还要对已达成的协议的执行进行充分的监督。
    具有大规模毁灭性的武器，即使是为了实验目的所进行的爆炸也必须停止，因为这些爆炸对人类可能发生危害。裂变物质将来必须只用于和平目的，必须禁止进一步把它用于战争目的。
    三国政府首脑极为关心和平利用原子能方面的充分和平等的国际合作。这种合作必须在联合国范围内进行，一切国家必须参加拟议中的国际机构。
    联合声明然后说：加强努力以加速世界上不发达的地区的发展是建立国际间永久和稳定的和平的主要任务之一。在这方面，三国政府首脑认识到进行经济和财政方面的国际合作的重要性，并且认为设立拟议中的联合国经济发展特别基金，并且使它可能发挥有效作用是必要的和适宜的。
    三国政府首脑在他们会谈过程中强调指出取消禁运和消除妨碍国际贸易正常交流和发展的障碍的巨大重要性。
    三国政府首脑认为，中欧、亚洲的远东以及欧洲和亚洲之间的中东地区是三个紧张的和可能发生冲突的主要地区。
    联合声明说：没有中华人民共和国的充分合作，远东问题不能得到适当解决。三国政府首脑表示，他们认为中华人民共和国应该有代表参加联合国。他们还认为，那些申请加入联合国，而按照宪章又合格的国家应该被接纳进入联合国。
    中欧问题是同德国问题密切相关的。这个重要问题必须按照德国人民的愿望，通过和平谈判达成协议的办法来加以解决。
    在中东，大国之间互相冲突的利益使形势更加困难。这个问题必须按实际情况来加以考虑，一方面保障合法的经济利益，但是要以有关人民的自由作为解决办法的基础。这个地区人民的自由和好感不仅对于自由，对于保障合法的经济利益也是必不可少的。
    巴勒斯坦的局势是对世界和平特别危险的一种局势。三国政府首脑在这方面支持万隆会议的决议。
    三国政府首脑也考虑了阿尔及利亚的局势，他们认为，这个问题不仅具有重大意义，而且从阿尔及利亚人民的基本权利方面和从巩固世界上这个地区的和平方面来说，都需要迫切加以注意。
    他们认为，殖民统治是完全不适当的，它对于统治者和被统治者都有害处。因此，他们必须对阿尔及利亚人民要求和平的愿望表示同情。他们认识到，在阿尔及利亚有数目相当多的欧洲血统的人，他们的利益应该得到保护，但是这不应该妨碍对阿尔及利亚人民的合法权利的承认。
    他们热烈地支持在谋求公正与和平的解决方面，特别是在结束这个地区的严重冲突和在促成谈判方面所作的一切努力。停火和有关方面之间的谈判应该导致这个问题的和平解决。
    联合声明最后说：三国政府首脑认识到世界上的问题不能一下都解决，必须耐心和善意地坚持不懈地设法达成解决办法。但是，重要的是，要尽一切努力来制造和平的气氛，和按照联合国宪章的基本原则采取行动。
