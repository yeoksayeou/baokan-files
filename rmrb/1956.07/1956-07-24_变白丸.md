    “Whitening Pills”
    The London "Sunday Times" says that some scientists are studying how to turn black people into white people. It is said that in about twenty years, a pill will be manufactured that can turn black people white.
    From "white racial superiority" to the lynchings of the Ku Klux Klan, the "free world" has never lacked "knowledge" involving the issue of human skin color. Now, through this news item in the London newspaper, we know that this type of "knowledge" field has added something that might be tentatively called "the study of turning black people white." However, I am not here to condemn those scientists who are keen on studying how to turn black people white. Perhaps they still have a compassionate heart; although they cannot escape the pitfall of white superiority, they are at least unwilling to see American blacks often threatened with being slowly cut to pieces, South African blacks being tied up and forced into labor or sold, Kenyan blacks being used as live targets for shooting practice by the British army, etc., which may have aroused their interest in studying how to turn black people white, which cannot be ruled out.
    Indeed, for many years, hundreds of millions of human beings have suffered so much humiliation, misfortune, and disaster simply because their skin has grown into black or red colors! Taking "civilized" America as an example, the insults and sufferings endured by black people and Native Americans are often unimaginable to people outside this "free world."
    Among the audiences who have seen the film "Silver Gray Powder," who can fail to be deeply shocked and angered by the brutal scenes of wolves burning crosses in the American night, threatening the lives of black people? People know that these scenes are not fabricated out of thin air. On the land of North America, how many black lives have been swallowed up in the firelight of ghostly crosses! Just last year, Emmett Till, a fifteen-year-old child in Mississippi, was tortured to death for one reason only: that Till had black skin. This is just one example of countless brutal murders of black people. What is even more shocking is that American racists often murder black people with the connivance or even assistance of the police and the protection of the courts.
    However, times have changed. In this world, it is becoming increasingly difficult to oppress and abuse black people or other people of color. The vast number of colored people have awakened. The Bandung Conference of Asian and African countries resolutely condemned racial discrimination. More and more white people in capitalist countries have also realized this truth: inciting racial hatred and maintaining racial discrimination aims, politically, to divert people's attention from class exploitation under the capitalist system, and to split the unity of the working people; economically, it is to ensure a large number of cheap labor.
    In the United States, the headquarters of racial discrimination, in recent years, more and more white workers have stood on the same front as black people, opposing racial discrimination and engaging in strike struggles together.
    Sixteen million American blacks have been waging an increasingly tenacious struggle to defend their dignity as human beings and no longer allow a life of being slaughtered at will to remain unchanged.
    The great American poet Walt Whitman once praised black people:
      "His glance is calm and commanding, he tosses the slouch of his hat away from his forehead,
    The sun falls on his crisp cut hair and whisker'd face,
    The sun falls on the ampple and muscular parts of his body and neck,
    The sun falls on his coal-black hands and feet."
    All honest people of all races are beautiful and worthy of pride. Isn't the U.S. State Department trying its best to prevent the black singer Robeson from going abroad because it is afraid that this upright and beautiful black man will use his loud singing to spread the seeds of peace and friendship to all countries?
    Even if it is not just a casual remark, but a pill that turns black people white is really made in twenty years. However, whether anyone wants to take this pill in twenty years is also a big question.
    What people need is to strip off the white robes and hoods of the Ku Klux Klan and all kinds of decorations of racists, expose their reactionary nature, and eliminate racial discrimination and its social roots. Whitening pills are not needed.

### “变白丸”

    “变白丸”
    伦敦“星期日泰晤士报”说，有些科学家正在研究怎样使黑人变成白人。据说，大约再过二十年后，就会有一种使黑人变白的药丸制造出来。
    从“白色种族优越论”到三K党徒的私刑，“自由世界”中原本就有了不少牵连到人类肤色问题的“学问”。现在，通过伦敦报纸上这则消息，使我们知道，这类
  “学问”领域又多了一种姑名之为“黑人变白学”的东西。不过，我在这里并没有谴责那些热中于研究黑人变白人的科学家的意思。也许他们还是抱着悲天悯人的心肠，虽然脱不出白人优越论的窠臼，总算是不忍看到美国黑人常常遭到凌迟的威胁，南非联邦的黑人被绑着去强迫劳役或贩卖，怯尼亚黑人被英军当作活靶练习射击，等等，才引起他们研究黑人变白的兴趣，也未可料。
    的确，多少年来，数以亿计的人类，只是由于他们的皮肤生长成黑或红等色泽，受到了多少凌辱、祸害、灾难啊！以“文明”的美国来说，黑人和印第安人所遭受的侮辱和苦难，就常常是这个“自由世界”以外的人们所难以想像的。
    看过影片“银灰色的粉末”的观众们，有谁能不为狼群们在美国的黑夜里燃烧起十字架，威胁黑人生命的暴虐场景而深感震骇和愤怒吗？人们知道，这种场景并不是凭空虚构的。在北亚美利加的土地上，多少黑人的生命，在幽灵般的十字架的火光下被吞噬了啊。就在去年，密士失必州一个十五岁的儿童蒂尔被虐杀了，原因只有一个，就是蒂尔这孩子长了黑皮肤。这只是无数虐杀黑人的残暴的事例中的一个。更其令人震惊的是，美国种族主义者的虐杀黑人，常常是在警察的纵容甚至帮助和法院的包庇下进行的。
    可是，时代变化了。在这个世界上，要欺压和虐害黑人或其他有色人种，已经愈来愈不容易了。广大的有色人种已经觉醒。亚非国家的万隆会议坚决谴责了种族歧视。资本主义国家愈来愈多的白种人民，也认识到这个真理：煽动种族仇恨和维护种族歧视，它的目的在政治上是转移人们对资本主义制度下阶级剥削的注意，分裂劳动人民的团结，在经济上是保证大批廉价的劳动力。
    在美国这个种族歧视的大本营里，这些年来，已有愈来愈多的白种工人与黑人站在一条战线上，反对种族歧视，一起进行罢工斗争等等。
    一千六百万美国黑人已经进行日益顽强的斗争，来维护他们作为人的尊严，不再容许任人宰割的生活一成不变了。
    美国的伟大诗人惠特曼曾经讴歌黑人：
      “他的眼神安静而威严，他从前额上将搭拉着的帽缘向后掀去，
    太阳照着他卷曲的黑发和胡子，照着他光泽而健壮的肢体的黑色。
    我看到这个图画般的巨人，我爱他……”
    各族正直的人民都是美的，值得骄傲的。美国国务院千方百计阻挠黑人歌唱家罗伯逊出国，不就是因为它害怕这位正直而美好的黑人会用嘹亮的歌声，到各国散布和平和友谊的种子吗？
    即使不是姑妄言之，而是二十年后真的制成了黑人变白人的药丸。可是，二十年后，究竟有谁要吃这种药丸也是大成问题的。
    人们需要的是剥下三K党徒的白衣白罩和种族主义者各式各样的装饰，暴露他们的反动本质，消灭种族歧视及其存在的社会根源。不需要变白丸。
