    Let the Children Sing Their Own Songs
    Yu Ming
    Next door to our office is the Second Street Nursery of the Zhenming District in Ningbo City. Because we are so close, the children's singing often reaches our ears. The pure singing of children is the most touching. However, we often feel uncomfortable. Because these four- and five-year-old children are stretching their necks and struggling to sing: "Blue sky, white clouds floating, horses running under the white clouds..." or "The north wind blows, snowflakes flutter, windy and snowy weather, two birds..." Some high notes and long notes, even if they strain their voices to sing, they still can't sing them, and by the second half of the sentence, it becomes a mute sound. Naturally, there's no need to talk about whether they can understand these lyrics.
    At such times, we adults can't help but frown, you look at me, I look at you. We cannot help but appeal for the children: Composer uncles, please write more songs for us! Nursery teachers, aunts, let us sing our own songs!

    让孩子们唱自己的歌
    俞明
    在我们机关隔壁，是宁波市镇明区第二街道托儿站。由于相距得近，孩子们的歌声常常传到我们的耳朵里。儿童的纯真的歌声原是最动人的。可是，我们却时常感到不好受。因为这些四、五岁的孩子们正拉长着脖子、吃力地唱着：“蓝蓝的天上白云飘，白云下面马儿跑，……”或是“北风那个吹，雪花那个飘，风天那个雪地，二只鸟……”，有些高音和长音，他们虽然拚着嗓子唱，还是唱不出来，唱到后半句，就变成哑音了。自然，就不必再说这些歌词是不是能为他们领会了。
    在这种时候，我们这些成年人不禁皱起眉头，你看看我，我看看你。我们不能不为儿童们呼吁：作曲家叔叔，多为我们写点歌！保育员、阿姨，让我们唱自己的歌吧！
