Chapter 1: General Principles

Article 1: The agricultural producers' cooperative (all agricultural producers' cooperatives referred to in these regulations are advanced agricultural producers' cooperatives) is a socialist collective economic organization organized by laboring farmers under the leadership and assistance of the Communist Party and the People's Government on a voluntary and mutually beneficial basis.

Article 2: The agricultural producers' cooperative, in accordance with socialist principles, transfers the major means of production privately owned by its members to collective ownership by the cooperative, organizes collective labor, and implements "from each according to his ability, to each according to his work," with equal pay for equal work regardless of gender or age.

Article 3: The agricultural producers' cooperative shall, according to local conditions, continuously improve agricultural technology and, with the assistance of the state, gradually realize the mechanization and electrification of agriculture, so that the rural economy continuously develops forward; at the same time, it shall, with the development of production, continuously increase the income of its members and improve their material and cultural living standards.

Article 4: The agricultural producers' cooperative shall correctly combine collective interests and individual interests. Members must obey and protect the collective interests of the entire cooperative, and the cooperative must care for and consider the individual interests of its members.

Article 5: The agricultural producers' cooperative shall correctly combine the interests of the entire cooperative and the interests of the state. The cooperative should independently manage production under the guidance of the state economic plan. The cooperative must conscientiously fulfill its obligations to the state to pay agricultural tax and sell agricultural products.

Article 6: The agricultural producers' cooperative implements democratic management. The leaders of the cooperative are elected by the members, and major affairs of the cooperative are discussed and decided by the members. The leaders of the cooperative must implement collective leadership, maintain close ties with the masses, consult with the masses on all matters, and unite all members to run the cooperative well.

Chapter 2: Members

Article 7: Male and female laboring farmers who are sixteen years of age or older and other laborers who are able to participate in labor within the cooperative may join the cooperative as members. Membership requires a voluntary application by the individual and approval by the members' meeting or members' representative meeting.

The cooperative shall actively absorb family members of martyrs, family members of military personnel, family members of state organ staff, disabled veterans, and demobilized soldiers (including military and political personnel who returned to their hometowns after demobilization after the uprising and peaceful liberation) into the cooperative, and shall also absorb the old, weak, orphaned, widowed, and disabled into the cooperative. The cooperative shall also absorb immigrants into the cooperative.

Article 8: For past landlord elements and rich peasant elements who have abandoned exploitation, the cooperative, based on their performance and participation in labor production, and after examination and approval by the township people's committee, may respectively absorb them into the cooperative as members or probationary members.

Rural counter-revolutionary elements of the past, if they have only minor crimes in history and have now repented, or if their crimes are relatively serious but have made significant contributions to the suppression of counter-revolution, as well as those who have been released from prison and are performing well, the cooperative, based on their degree of repentance and the size of their contributions, and after examination and approval by the township people's committee, may respectively absorb them into the cooperative as members or probationary members.

For past landlord elements, rich peasant elements, and counter-revolutionary elements who do not meet the conditions for joining the cooperative, the cooperative, with the approval of the township people's committee, may absorb them to participate in labor within the cooperative, so that they can be transformed into new people. For these people, the cooperative should pay them remuneration according to their labor in the same way as it treats members, and should handle their means of production in the same way as it treats members. If these people perform well, they may become members or probationary members after examination and approval by the township people's committee.

If probationary members perform well, they may become members after examination and approval by the township people's committee.

Family members of landlords and rich peasants who have not participated in exploitation, and family members of counter-revolutionary elements who have not participated in counter-revolutionary activities, may join the cooperative as members.

Article 9: Each member has the following rights equally:

(1) To participate in labor within the cooperative and obtain the remuneration he deserves.
(2) To make suggestions and criticisms regarding cooperative affairs, participate in discussions and voting on cooperative affairs, and supervise cooperative affairs.
(3) To elect the leaders of the cooperative and to be elected as the leaders of the cooperative.
(4) To engage in household sideline occupations without hindering the production of the cooperative.
(5) To enjoy the benefits of the cultural and welfare undertakings organized by the cooperative.
Past landlord elements, rich peasant elements, and counter-revolutionary elements, within a certain period after joining the cooperative, do not have the right to be elected and cannot hold any important positions within the cooperative; those who are probationary members also do not have the right to vote or be elected.

Article 10: Each member has the following obligations equally:

(1) To abide by the cooperative's regulations and implement the resolutions of the members' meeting, the members' representative meeting, and the management committee.
(2) To actively participate in labor within the cooperative and abide by labor discipline.
(3) To cherish the property of the state and the property of the cooperative.
(4) To consolidate the unity of the entire cooperative and wage a resolute struggle against all activities that undermine the cooperative.

Article 11: Members have the freedom to withdraw from the cooperative. Members who request to withdraw from the cooperative generally must do so after the end of the production year. When a member withdraws from the cooperative, he may take away his land or an equal amount and quality of land that he brought into the cooperative, and may withdraw the share fund he paid and his investment.

Article 12: If a member seriously violates the cooperative's regulations and does not repent after repeated education and punishment, his membership may be revoked by a decision of the members' meeting or members' representative meeting. If a person whose membership has been revoked does not agree, he may request the township or county people's committee to resolve the matter.

A person whose membership has been revoked may remain in the cooperative to participate in labor, and the cooperative should pay him remuneration according to his labor in the same way as it treats members. If a person whose membership has been revoked is willing to leave the cooperative for production, he may take away his land or an equal amount and quality of land that he brought into the cooperative, and may withdraw the share fund he paid and his investment.

If a person whose membership has been revoked has repented, the members' meeting or members' representative meeting may restore his membership.

Chapter 3: Land and Other Major Means of Production

Article 13: Farmers who join the cooperative must transfer their privately owned land and major means of production such as draft animals and large farm implements to collective ownership by the cooperative.

The means of livelihood privately owned by members and scattered trees, poultry, livestock, small farm implements, and tools needed for household sideline occupations remain privately owned by the members and are not brought into the cooperative.

Privately owned ponds, wells, and other water conservancy facilities attached to the land of members are transferred to collective ownership by the cooperative along with the land. If these water conservancy facilities are newly built and the owner has not yet received benefits, the cooperative should appropriately compensate the owner for the cost of labor and materials. If the loans owed for the construction of these water conservancy facilities have not been repaid, the cooperative should be responsible for repayment.

When privately owned lotus ponds, fish ponds, reed ponds, etc., of members are transferred to collective ownership by the cooperative, the cooperative should pay the owner a reasonable price for the lotus roots, fish, reeds, etc., in the ponds.

Article 14: After the land of members is transferred to collective ownership by the cooperative and land remuneration is abolished, the cooperative should appropriately arrange labor suitable for members who cannot undertake major labor. If they have difficulties in life, the cooperative should give them appropriate care; for members who have completely lost their ability to work and have historically relied on land income to maintain their lives, their lives should be maintained with public welfare funds, and appropriate land remuneration may also be given temporarily when necessary.

For family members of military personnel, family members of martyrs, and disabled veteran members, the cooperative should also give preferential treatment in accordance with the state's regulations on preferential treatment.

Article 15: Persons who are engaged in urban occupations, whose entire families live in cities, or who live in rural areas, whose labor force is outside, and whose families have no one participating in labor, may hand over their privately owned land in rural areas to the cooperative for use. If the owner has difficulties in life and has historically relied on land income to subsidize his life, the cooperative should give him care and pay him a certain land remuneration. If the owner moves to the countryside, or the labor force outside returns to the countryside to engage in agricultural production, the cooperative should absorb him into the cooperative. If he is unwilling to join the cooperative, the cooperative should give him his original land or an equal amount and quality of land.

Article 16: The agricultural producers' cooperative should allocate a certain amount of land to the members for growing vegetables. The amount of land allocated to each household of members is determined according to the size of each household's population, and the land used by each person generally cannot exceed 5% of the local average land per person.

The original graves and house foundations of members do not need to be brought into the cooperative. The house foundations needed by members for building new houses and the graves needed by members without graves are to be resolved by the cooperative in a unified manner. When necessary, the cooperative may apply to the township people's committee for assistance in resolving the matter.

Article 17: Draft animals and large farm implements privately owned by members and sideline tools not needed by members for household sideline occupations but needed by the cooperative are transferred to collective ownership by the cooperative, and the amount of the price should be negotiated according to the local normal price and paid to the owner in installments. The time for full payment is generally three years, and at most not more than five years. The issue of interest on the price that has not been paid off should be resolved by the cooperative through consultation with the owner.

Small farm implements needed in production, such as sickles and hoes, are to be prepared and repaired by the members themselves.

Article 18: Privately owned trees of members should be handled according to the following principles:

(1) A small number of scattered trees remain privately owned by the members.
(2) Young forests and nurseries are transferred to collective ownership by the cooperative, with the cooperative compensating the owner for a certain amount of labor and material costs.
(3) Large areas of fruit trees, tea trees, mulberry trees, bamboo, tung trees, lacquer trees, and other economic forests are valued for collective ownership by the cooperative based on the size of future income, the difficulty of management, the labor and material costs incurred by the owner, and the amount of income obtained, and the price is paid back in installments from the income of the forest. At the beginning of the cooperative's establishment, these economic forests may also temporarily remain privately owned by the members, managed by the cooperative in a unified manner, and a certain proportion of remuneration is paid to the owner from the income of these forests.
(4) Large areas of timber forests should be valued according to the timber volume and grade at that time and transferred to collective ownership by the cooperative, and the price is paid back in installments from the income of the forest. At the beginning of the cooperative's establishment, these timber forests may also temporarily remain privately owned by the members, managed by the cooperative in a unified manner, and a certain proportion of remuneration is paid to the owner from the income of these forests.

Article 19: Herds of livestock privately owned by members should generally be purchased by the cooperative at the local normal price and transferred to collective ownership by the cooperative, and the price is paid back in installments over several years. The time limit for full payment of the price and the issue of interest on the price that has not been paid off should be resolved by the cooperative through consultation with the owner.

At the beginning of the cooperative's establishment, herds of livestock may also temporarily remain privately owned by the members, managed by the cooperative in a unified manner, and the remuneration to which the owner is entitled is negotiated according to local customs.

Chapter 4: Funds

Article 20: In order to raise production costs and purchase the means of production privately owned by members, the agricultural producers' cooperative may collect share funds from members according to production needs and the ability of members to bear the burden.

Article 21: Share funds are shared by the entire cooperative's labor force.

In the initial stage of the cooperative, if the share funds have already been shared by the members according to land or according to land and labor each accounting for a certain proportion, they will no longer be re-shared.

When members pay share funds, they may use various means of production needed by the cooperative to offset the payment. If it is not enough, the insufficient part is paid to the cooperative by the members in installments; if there is a surplus, the surplus part is returned to the members by the cooperative in installments according to the provisions of Articles 17, 18, and 19. Poor members who still cannot pay off the share funds after applying to the bank for a poverty alleviation cooperative fund loan may be allowed to postpone or reduce the payment by a decision of the members' meeting or members' representative meeting. The share funds paid in installments and postponed are not calculated for interest.

The full price of all means of production of past landlord elements and rich peasant elements who join the cooperative, after offsetting the share of share funds that should be shared, if there is a surplus, should be used to pay a public accumulation fund and a public welfare fund. If there is still a surplus, it is treated as an overpayment of share funds.

Share funds are recorded under each person's name, do not accrue interest, and cannot be withdrawn unless they withdraw from the cooperative.

Article 22: The agricultural producers' cooperative should set aside a certain amount of public accumulation fund and public welfare fund from the annual income. The public accumulation fund is used for production expenses needed to expand production, reserve seeds and feed, and expenses for adding to the cooperative's fixed assets, and cannot be used for other purposes. The public welfare fund is used to develop the cooperative's cultural and welfare undertakings and cannot be used for other purposes.

The cooperative's public accumulation fund and public welfare fund cannot be taken away when members withdraw from the cooperative, and new members (except for past landlord elements and rich peasant elements with relatively many means of production) do not need to make up for the payment when they join the cooperative.

Article 23: When the agricultural producers' cooperative does not have enough funds, members may invest in the cooperative according to their own strength on a voluntary basis. However, the cooperative must not force members to invest.

The cooperative is responsible for repaying the members' investment, and the time limit for repayment is determined by the cooperative through consultation with the members. The interest on cash investments should generally be equivalent to the deposit interest of credit cooperatives. No interest may be given on in-kind investments, or appropriate interest may be paid according to local customs.

Article 24: When several cooperatives merge, share funds are generally not re-shared. If some cooperatives have fewer share funds because some means of production have not been transferred to collective ownership, they should transfer those means of production to collective ownership and make up for the share funds before the merger.

When several cooperatives merge, all public property cannot be divided. The members' investment and external loans used to add to the cooperative's fixed assets are transferred to the new cooperative after the merger along with the fixed assets, and the new cooperative is responsible for repayment.

Chapter 5: Production and Operation

Article 25: In organizing and developing production, the agricultural producers' cooperative must implement the policy of running the cooperative diligently and thriftily, actively expand the scope of production, and develop a multi-sector economy combined with agriculture; it must practice strict economy and reduce production costs.

Article 26: The agricultural producers' cooperative should actively take the following measures according to its own economic conditions and local natural conditions to improve the level of agricultural production:

(1) Build water conservancy facilities and conserve water and soil.
(2) Adopt new-style farm implements and gradually realize agricultural mechanization.
(3) Actively use all possible conditions to open up sources of fertilizer and improve the method of using fertilizer.
(4) Adopt superior varieties.
(5) Appropriately and planfully develop high-yield crops.
(6) Improve the soil and repair farmland.
(7) Rationally use farmland and expand the multiple cropping area.
(8) Improve cultivation methods and practice intensive farming and meticulous cultivation.
(9) Prevent and eliminate insect pests, diseases, and other disasters.
(10) Protect and breed livestock and improve livestock breeds.
(11) Without hindering water and soil conservation, planfully reclaim wasteland and expand the cultivated area.

The cooperative should actively learn advanced production experience, strive to find the most important methods for increasing production in the cooperative, and implement them with the greatest effort.

Article 27: The agricultural producers' cooperative should strive to increase the production of major crops such as grain and cotton according to the state's plan and local conditions, and at the same time develop mulberry, tea, hemp, oil crops, sugar cane, sugar beets, tobacco leaves, fruits, medicinal materials, spices, and other economic crops.

Article 28: The agricultural producers' cooperative should actively develop forestry, animal husbandry, aquaculture, handicrafts, transportation, sericulture, beekeeping, poultry farming, and other sideline production according to needs and possibilities.

Without hindering the production of the cooperative, the cooperative should encourage and appropriately help members engage in household sideline occupations.

Article 29: The agricultural producers' cooperative should formulate a comprehensive production plan and conduct production planfully.

The cooperative should formulate a long-term plan of more than three years to comprehensively plan various production and construction projects during this period.

Before the beginning of each production year, the cooperative should set out an annual production plan. The annual production plan includes the following main contents: 1. Crop planting plan and yield plan, and technical measures to ensure the completion of the plan; 2. Forestry, animal husbandry, aquaculture, and other sideline production plans; 3. Basic construction plan; 4. Labor and animal power use plan.

In order to ensure the completion of the annual production plan, the cooperative should set out a seasonal or sectional production plan according to the agricultural season or cultivation section, specifically stipulating the production tasks and the time limit for completing the tasks.

Chapter 6: Labor Organization and Labor Remuneration

Article 30: The agricultural producers' cooperative should, according to the scope of production and operation, the need for division of labor in production, and the situation of the members, divide the members into several field production teams and sideline production groups or sideline production teams, and designate special personnel to be responsible for accounting, technical management, livestock feeding, safekeeping of public property, and other professional work, in order to implement a responsibility system in production.

Article 31: The production team is the basic unit of labor organization of the agricultural producers' cooperative, and the members of the production team should be fixed. The field production team is responsible for managing fixed land and using fixed draft animals and farm implements. The sideline production group or sideline production team is responsible for managing fixed sideline production and using fixed sideline tools.

When equipping the field production team with members and assigning tasks, consideration should be given to the amount of land cultivated, the distribution of land, the types of crops planted, and the distance of the members' residences, and the amount of labor, the level of technology, and the strength of leadership should be adapted to the production tasks undertaken by the production team. Corresponding consideration should also be given when equipping the sideline production group or sideline production team with members and assigning tasks.

When necessary, the management committee may transfer personnel, draft animals, farm implements, and tools from one production team to support another production team, or form a temporary production team to complete a certain task.

Article 32: The agricultural producers' cooperative should correctly stipulate the norms and remuneration standards for various jobs and implement piece-rate wages.

Each work norm should be the amount and quality that a medium laborer can achieve in a day of active labor under the same conditions, and should not be too high or too low.

The remuneration standard for each work norm is calculated in labor days. The number of labor days that should be earned for completing each work norm is stipulated according to the technical level, arduousness, and importance of the work in production. The difference in remuneration standards for various work norms should be set appropriately and should not be too high or too low. When working conditions change, the management committee may appropriately adjust the work norms.

Article 33: The agricultural producers' cooperative may implement production quotas and overproduction bonuses. Each field production team and sideline production group or sideline production team must guarantee the completion of the stipulated production plan and must also guarantee that certain sideline products reach a certain quality. For those who have overfulfilled the production plan, additional labor days should be given as a reward, depending on the circumstances. For those who are poorly managed and whose output or product quality does not meet the plan, labor days should be deducted as a penalty, depending on the circumstances. If an irresistible disaster is encountered, the production plan should be appropriately revised.

If the production of the entire cooperative overfulfills the production plan due to good leadership, additional labor days should be given to the meritorious management personnel as a reward.

Members who have made creative inventions in production technology and have made special contributions to the protection of public property and the saving of expenses should be given additional labor days as a reward.

Article 34: The agricultural producers' cooperative should formulate a labor plan. When stipulating the annual, seasonal, or sectional production plan for each production team, the number of labor days needed to complete the production plan should be calculated at the same time. The cooperative may implement contract labor and contract the production tasks to the production team according to the calculated number of labor days.

The cooperative stipulates how many labor days each member should complete in the whole year and each season or each section according to the needs of production and the self-reporting of the members. When stipulating how many labor days each member should do, the cooperative should pay attention to the physical condition of the members, take care of the physiological characteristics of the female members, and consider the actual needs of participating in household labor.

After the members have done enough of the stipulated labor days, the remaining time is freely disposed of by the members.

Article 35: The management personnel of the agricultural producers' cooperative, who often cannot directly participate in production labor, should have a certain number of labor days negotiated by the members' meeting or the members' representative meeting as remuneration, according to the amount of tasks they undertake and the complexity of the work. Management personnel who spend part of their time participating in cooperative affairs and members who participate in temporary cooperative affairs should be given an appropriate number of labor days as a subsidy, according to the amount of work they participate in and the amount of production labor time they take up.

The labor days obtained by the director of the cooperative in the whole year should generally be higher than the labor days obtained by a medium laborer in a year.

The number of management personnel in the cooperative should not be excessive. The total number of labor days obtained by all management personnel participating in cooperative affairs, plus the number of labor days subsidized to members participating in temporary cooperative affairs, should at most not exceed 2% of the total number of labor days in the cooperative.

Article 36: The agricultural producers' cooperative should organize labor competitions. Through labor competitions, mobilize members to actively improve labor efficiency and production technology, overcome various difficulties that occur in production, and complete and overfulfill the production plan. The cooperative should reward advanced units or individuals in labor competitions.

Article 37: The agricultural producers' cooperative should establish a system of inspection and acceptance in labor management. The management committee and the captains of each production team should timely and thoroughly check whether each team and each individual has completed the task according to the stipulated quantity, quality, and time. For production teams or individuals who have not completed the task according to the stipulations, they may be required to redo the task or deduct labor days depending on the circumstances.

Article 38: Members of the agricultural producers' cooperative must abide by the following labor discipline:

(1) Not to be absent from work without reason.
(2) To obey orders during labor.
(3) To guarantee the quality of work.
(4) To cherish public property.

Members who violate labor discipline should be educated and criticized. If the circumstances are serious, they may be given penalties such as deduction of labor days, compensation for losses, revocation of positions, and even revocation of membership.

Chapter 7: Financial Management and Income Distribution

Article 39: The management committee of the agricultural producers' cooperative should formulate an annual financial budget at the same time as formulating the annual production plan, and implement it after it is approved by the members' meeting or the members' representative meeting.

The cooperative's budget should include: the source of funds (including in-kind and cash) and the plan for using funds in the current year, the estimated total value of production in the current year, and the estimated distribution.

Article 40: The agricultural producers' cooperative must strictly pay attention to economy and avoid waste when using funds, and implement the policy of running the cooperative diligently and thriftily in financial management. Expenditure limits should be set for each item of production expenses in the annual budget (including expenses for seeds, fertilizers, and fodder, expenses for purchasing pesticides, repairing farm implements, and treating draft animals, expenses paid to tractor stations and animal-powered farm implement stations for cultivation fees and pumping stations for irrigation fees, expenses for sideline production turnover, and production management fees, etc.). The limit for the cooperative's production management fees (excluding remuneration and subsidies for cooperative affairs) should at most not exceed 5/1000 of the total value of annual production.

Article 41: The agricultural producers' cooperative must establish necessary financial systems and procedures.

All expenditures of the cooperative must go through certain examination and approval procedures. General expenditures within the budget must be approved by the director of the management committee. Larger expenditures within the budget must be approved by the management committee. Additional budgets must be discussed and approved by the members' meeting or the members' representative meeting. Accountants and cashiers have the right to refuse all expenditures that do not conform to the system and procedures. All income and expenses of the cooperative must be proven by receipts, and the accountant keeps accounts based on the receipts. The cooperative's accounting and cashier work must be assigned to different people.

The cooperative's accounts must be cleared daily and settled monthly, and the results of income and expenses must be announced quarterly and by production year. The account of labor days obtained by each member must be announced monthly.

The cooperative's public property must be kept by a special person. The list of public property is announced at the time of the annual settlement of accounts.

Article 42: The public property of the agricultural producers' cooperative must be protected and no member may infringe upon it. For those who embezzle, steal, or destroy public property, or who cause significant losses to public property due to irresponsibility, the cooperative should give the deserved punishments according to the circumstances, and should also ask them to return the original object or compensate for it; for those whose circumstances are serious, they should be handled by the judicial organs.

Article 43: The in-kind and cash income of the agricultural producers' cooperative for the whole year, after paying taxes in accordance with state regulations, should be distributed according to the following items, based on the principle of both increasing the personal income of members year by year and increasing the public accumulation of the cooperative:

(1) Deduct the production expenses consumed in the current year and leave them for production expenses in the next year and for repaying loans and investments for production turnover in the current year.
(2) Set aside a certain proportion of public accumulation fund and public welfare fund from the income left over after deducting consumption. The public accumulation fund generally does not exceed 8%, including the repayment of basic construction loans and investments that are due. The public welfare fund does not exceed 2%. For cooperatives that operate economic crops, the public accumulation fund may be increased to 12%.
(3) All the remaining in-kind and cash are distributed according to all labor days (including labor days for agricultural production, sideline production, cooperative affairs, and labor days awarded to production teams or individuals).

If the cooperative's production has not increased much, the public accumulation fund may be reduced in order to increase the personal income of members. In the event of a famine year, the public accumulation fund may be reduced or not set aside. In the event of a bumper year, the public accumulation fund may also be increased as appropriate on the condition of ensuring the increase of members' personal income. The income distribution plan should be discussed and approved by the members' meeting or the members' representative meeting.

Article 44: The agricultural products harvested in the spring and summer, after the agricultural producers' cooperative has left what it needs, should be pre-distributed to the members according to the number of labor days they have already obtained, and then settled at the end of the production year. The cooperative's cash income and the state's pre-purchase deposit for agricultural products, after leaving what is needed, should be pre-paid to the members in installments according to the labor days they have already obtained and their actual needs, and then settled at the end of the production year.

Chapter 8: Political Work

Article 45: The agricultural producer's cooperative, under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, and with the assistance of the Communist Youth League and the Women's Federation, shall carry out political work.

The purpose of political work is to ensure the completion of the production plan, ensure the implementation of the policy of diligence and thrift in running the cooperative, oppose extravagance and waste, ensure that remuneration is based on labor and equal pay for equal work regardless of gender or age, and ensure that the collective interests of the cooperative, the interests of the state, and the personal interests of the members are correctly combined, and to consolidate the agricultural producer's cooperative ideologically and organizationally.
