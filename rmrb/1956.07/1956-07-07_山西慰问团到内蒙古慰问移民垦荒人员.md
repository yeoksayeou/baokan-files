Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, 6th - The Shanxi Province Immigrant慰问团 (comfort delegation) departed from Hohhot on the 5th to visit the five youth垦荒队 (land reclamation teams) from Shanxi Province who are working on wasteland in the Ulanqab League and the Hetao Administrative Region of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region.

The delegation arrived in Hohhot on the 2nd. Representatives from the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region also joined the delegation.

The Hebei Province delegation will also visit垦荒移民 (land reclamation immigrants) in Inner Mongolia in mid-July.

This spring, nearly 10,000垦荒人员 (land reclamation workers) from these two provinces came to Inner Mongolia, reclaimed a large amount of wasteland, and planted crops and vegetables. People in the Ulanqab League and on the Yellow River Hetao wasteland are building new houses while reclaiming land. Recently, they have been moving into the newly built houses from their tents one after another.
