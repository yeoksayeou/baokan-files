    Random Thoughts
    Sima Niu
    Someone wrote an article advising young people to cultivate "noble and beautiful sentiments, rather than focusing their energy on issues of the sexes" (Beijing Daily, July 13th). According to the author's logic, love between the sexes is completely incompatible with "noble and beautiful sentiments." So many ancient and modern, Chinese and foreign writers and playwrights who have extolled "noble and beautiful sentiments" between the sexes must feel extremely ashamed in the face of this argument!
    It is said that some industrial and commercial households in Beijing are not as active in sanitation work this summer as in previous years. In the past, when the sanitation department looked for members of the Federation of Industry and Commerce, they always came immediately, but now it's not necessarily the case. The reason is that after the public-private partnership, some cadres in the Federation of Industry and Commerce are Party members, so the people from the street offices have concerns when looking for these cadres.
    Could it be said that this "concern" is a silent criticism!

    有人写文劝导青年应该培养“高尚优美的情操，而不是把心力用在两性问题上”（七月十三日北京日报），按作者逻辑，两性爱情竟与“高尚优美的情操”势不两立。古今中外多少歌颂两性间“高尚优美的情操”的文学家、戏剧家们，在这种论点面前，不知该多么自惭形秽！
    据说北京市某些工商户今夏搞卫生工作不如往年积极。过去卫生部门找工商联委员，总是一找就来，现在却不一定行了。原因是公私合营后，工商联有的干部是党员，因而街道办事处人员去找这些干部时有了顾虑。
    可不可以说，这“顾虑”就是一种无言的批评！
