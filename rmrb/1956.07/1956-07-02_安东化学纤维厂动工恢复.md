Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: The main production sections of the state-owned Andong Chemical Fiber Factory have recently begun restoration work, which is expected to be completed and put into operation in the second quarter of next year. The initial main product will be rayon made from wood pulp. This type of rayon has a wide range of uses and can be spun into various fabrics alone or mixed with any natural fiber. The cost is much lower than that of fabrics spun from any single natural fiber, and it is very durable.

It is expected that in the initial stage of operation, the daily output of rayon will reach three tons; by the fourth quarter, it can be increased to six tons. After gradually expanding the equipment, strong fibers or cellophane can also be produced.

    安东化学纤维厂动工恢复
    据新华社讯　国营安东化学纤维厂主要生产部分的工程已经在最近动工恢复，预计在明年第二季度完成投入生产。初期主要产品是用木浆制造毛。这种毛用处很广，可以单独或同任何一种天然纤维混合纺制出各种衣料，成本比任何一种单独天然纤维纺制衣料要低得多，而且很坚牢。
    预计在投入生产的初期，毛的日产量将达到三吨；到第四季度可提高到六吨。等逐渐扩充了设备后，还可以生产强力纤维或玻璃纸。
