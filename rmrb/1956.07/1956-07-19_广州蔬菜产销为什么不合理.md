Why are Guangzhou's Vegetable Production and Sales Unreasonable?
Wu Erxiang

    Guangzhou's suburban areas had a bumper vegetable harvest in the first half of the year, but farmers' incomes have decreased. Yangji Agricultural Cooperative's vegetable production in the first half of this year increased by more than 40% compared to the same period last year, but the income per labor day was only 98 cents, more than 50 cents less than the income per labor day in the same period last year. The more than 1,000 mu of vegetables in Fengjiang Agricultural Cooperative generally grew better than last year, but according to a survey of 166 old cooperative members, 134 households will have reduced income in the first half of this year.
        
    Blind Production
    Why did vegetable production increase while members' incomes decreased? The direct reason is that the purchase price of vegetables is too low. The purchase price of cucumbers on the market in May and June this year decreased by 62% compared to the same period last year; the purchase price of eggplants on the market in April and May also decreased significantly. According to statistics from the Shadong Agricultural Cooperative on eight major vegetables, the average yield per mu increased by 40% compared to last year, but the output value per mu decreased by 45% compared to last year. The reason for such a large change in vegetable prices is mainly the blindness of vegetable production and the lack of coordination between production and sales.
      After agricultural cooperativization, farmers actively expanded vegetable production. However, relevant departments did not promptly pay attention to guiding vegetable production. Vegetable production between cooperatives, districts, and between Guangzhou's suburban areas and neighboring counties lacked planned arrangements in terms of quantity, variety, and market launch time. No one knew exactly how large the market sales volume was or how much was being produced. The Guangzhou Vegetable Company only completed the second-quarter vegetable purchase and sales plan and sent it to the Guangzhou Suburban Area Office on March 18th; however, the vegetables that went on the market in the second quarter had already been sown in December of last year and January and February of this year. The Guangzhou suburban cooperatives, relying on their own production enthusiasm and planting habits, expanded the vegetable planting area by about 4,000 mu and paid attention to processing and fertilization, so the vegetables all grew better than last year. The vegetables produced in several counties neighboring Guangzhou, such as Nanhai and Panyu, were mostly sold to the Guangzhou market in the past. This year, these counties also increased vegetable production. At the same time, farmers also "sowed at the same time and concentrated on the market," which made the contradiction between production and sales even more prominent. It is estimated that the daily sales volume of various vegetables in Guangzhou, including exports and sales to other cities, is a total of 900,000 jin; however, on one day in late March, the market supply of cabbage alone reached 1.2 million jin. Production exceeded sales, supply exceeded demand, resulting in a large backlog of vegetables.
    Depressed Purchase Prices
　The vegetable company did not understand the production and sales situation, and there was no pricing standard. If there were few goods, they were afraid of being out of stock, so they raised prices; if there were too many goods, they were afraid of backlog, so they lowered prices; the purchase price changed several times a day. This year, vegetables were concentrated on the market, the quantity was large, and there was a lot of backlog. The vegetable company did not actively try to expand sales, improve business management, and reduce losses and expenses, but instead relied on lowering purchase prices to make up for losses. Some vegetable purchase prices were not even enough to pay for the picking labor, so many cooperatives had to let large quantities of vegetables rot in the fields. Xiaogang Agricultural Cooperative in the suburbs of Guangzhou had more than 100 mu of tomatoes, estimated to yield more than 3,000 dan, but they rotted in the fields and no one wanted them. It is estimated that hundreds of thousands of dan of vegetables rotted in the fields in the suburbs of Guangzhou and neighboring counties, and vegetables used by farmers as fertilizer.
    
    Citizens Eat Expensive and Bad Vegetables
    With so many vegetables, the people of Guangzhou should be able to eat cheap and fresh vegetables, right? No, the opposite is true. Although a large number of tomatoes rotted, citizens had to pay 12 cents to buy one jin. The vegetable company always wants to make a profit from consumers, so they buy cheap and sell expensive. Small vendors also add prices indiscriminately. As a result, the purchase and sales price difference is several times or even dozens of times.
    In the past, when private merchants operated or farmers sold their own products, they would transport fresh vegetables to the city before dawn. But what about now? Look at the Yangji purchasing station of the vegetable company: the purchasing station only starts purchasing at 10:00 am, and after the purchase is completed, it is transported to the city by car and wholesale to small vendors. The fast ones can be delivered that afternoon, and the late ones have to wait until the next day. The Dadong purchasing station stipulates that wholesale will stop at 3:00 pm, even if a large number of vegetables are accumulated, they will have to wait until the next day to sell them. Therefore, the citizens are all dissatisfied and say: "The vegetables sold by farmers are fresh vegetables, the vegetables wholesale to the vendors are overnight vegetables, and the vegetables eaten by the citizens are vegetables that have been left for two nights."
    
    More seriously, many citizens sometimes cannot even buy stale vegetables. The cabbage hearts, Chinese cabbage hearts, and spinach in the second vendor group of Dongshan Sanjiaoshi are often out of stock. Water vendors report to the company that they need 100 jin of vegetables, but often only get 30 jin, which is not enough to sell. Some vegetable vendors have difficulty making a living because they cannot get enough fresh vegetables; other vegetable vendors intercept farmers' vegetables along the way, and the purchase price is often several times higher than that of the vegetable company.
    
    Vegetable Company Also Loses Money
    Despite buying cheap and selling expensive, the vegetable company still lost money: it is estimated that it will lose about 220,000 yuan in the first half of the year. This is the result of extremely chaotic management of the company. For example, in the northern transport of vegetables, there are often situations where there are vehicles but no goods, and there are goods but no vehicles. The ones that should have been transported to Shanghai were sometimes transported to Harbin; the ones that were to be transported to Taiyuan were transported to Shanghai; some were originally prepared for export, but were left to rot in the city; some were transported out, but their whereabouts were unknown. In this city, the situation of blind allocation is also very serious. The losses caused by this chaotic situation cannot be calculated.
    
    In short, the blindness of vegetable production and the chaotic state of vegetable business management have caused serious damage to vegetable farmers, urban people, and the country. At present, some farmers in the suburbs of Guangzhou are unwilling to process and fertilize the vegetable fields, and some farmers have plowed the vegetables and planted other crops. If this situation continues, the impact on vegetable production can be imagined.

    广州蔬菜产销为什么不合理
    吴尔祥
    广州市郊区上半年蔬菜丰收了，但是农民的收入却减少了。杨箕农业社今年上半年蔬菜比去年同期增产40％以上，每个劳动日收入只有九角八分，比去年同期每个劳动日的收入少五角多。凤江农业社的一千多亩菜一般都比去年长得好，但是据166户老社员的调查，今年上半年要减少收入的有134户。
        盲目生产
    为什么蔬菜丰产而社员却减少了收入呢？直接原因是蔬菜的收购价格过低。今年五、六月份上市黄瓜的收购价格就比去年同期下降62％；四、五月份上市的茄瓜收购价也下降很多。据沙东农业社八种主要蔬菜的统计，每亩产量平均比去年增加了40％，但每亩的产值反比去年降低了45％。蔬菜价格发生这样大变化的原因，主要是蔬菜生产的盲目性和产销不协调。
      农业合作化以后，农民积极扩大蔬菜生产。但是有关部门没有及时注意对蔬菜生产的领导，社与社、区与区、广州郊区与毗邻各县之间的蔬菜生产，在数量、品种、上市时间上都缺乏有计划的安排。到底市场销售量有多大、生产有多少，大家都是心中无数。广州市蔬菜公司到三月十八日才编好第二季度的蔬菜购销计划送到广州市郊区办事处；但是第二季度上市的蔬菜早在去年十二月和今年一、二月就已经下种了。广州郊区各个合作社凭着自己的生产热情和种植习惯，扩大了蔬菜种植面积约四千亩，并且注意了加工加肥，所以蔬菜都比去年长得好。毗邻广州市的南海、番禺等几个县生产的蔬菜，过去绝大部分是向广州市场推销的。今年这些县也增加了蔬菜生产。同时农民种菜又是“一齐下种，集中上市”，这样产销矛盾就更为突出。据估计，广州市各种蔬菜的日销量，包括出口和外销其他城市的在内，一共是九十万斤；但是三月下旬的一天，单是椰菜上市量就达到一百二十万斤。产大于销，供过于求，造成蔬菜的大量积压。压价收购　
　蔬菜公司对产销情况不摸底，又没有一个订价的标准，货来少了，害怕脱销，就提价；来多了，又怕积压，就压价；收购价格一天几变。今年蔬菜上市集中，数量大，积压多，蔬菜公司不是积极地设法扩大销路，改善经营管理，减低损耗和费用，而是靠压低收购价格来弥补亏损。有些蔬菜收购价甚至不够采摘的工钱，因此许多合作社只好让大批的蔬菜沤烂在田里。广州市郊区萧岗农业社有一百多亩番茄，估计可收三千多担，就沤烂在田里没有人要。据估计，广州市郊区和毗邻各县，在田里沤烂的蔬菜和农民用来做肥料的蔬菜有数十万担。
    市民吃的菜又贵又坏
    蔬菜这样多，广州市人民当会吃上廉价而新鲜的蔬菜了吧？不，事实恰恰相反。番茄虽然大量腐烂，而市民却要一角二分钱才能买一斤。蔬菜公司总想在消费者身上捞一把，他们就贱买贵卖。小摊贩也乱加价。结果，蔬菜购销差价相差几倍甚至几十倍。
    过去私商经营或农民自产自销的时候，都是天没亮就把新鲜蔬菜运到市区。但是现在呢？看看蔬菜公司杨箕收购站吧：上午十时收购站才开始收购，收完了才用汽车运送到市区批发给小摊贩，快的当天下午可以送到，迟的要等到第二天。大东收购站规定下午三时就停止批发，即使积存下了大批蔬菜，也要等到第二天再卖。因此市民们都不满地说：“农民卖的是新鲜菜，小贩批到的是隔夜菜，市民吃到的是隔两夜的菜。”
    更严重的是许多市民有时连不新鲜的蔬菜也买不到。东山三角市第二摊贩小组的白菜心、菜心、菠菜等就经常脱销。水上小贩向公司报领蔬菜一百斤，往往只能得到三十斤，不够卖。一部分菜贩因配不到足够数量的新鲜菜，生活发生困难；另一部分菜贩则拦途截购农民的蔬菜，收购价往往比蔬菜公司高好几倍。
    蔬菜公司也赔本
    尽管是贱买贵卖，蔬菜公司也还是亏了本：上半年估计要亏损二十来万元。这是公司经营管理极端混乱的结果。比如蔬菜北运，经常发生有车无货、有货无车的现象。本来应当运往上海的，有时运到哈尔滨；运往太原的，却运到了上海；有的原是准备外运的，却停放在市里腐烂了；有的运出去了，却不知去向。在本市，盲目调拨的情况也同样严重。这种混乱情况造成的损失无法计算。
    总之，蔬菜生产的盲目性和蔬菜经营管理的混乱状况，已经给种菜农民、城市人民和国家带来了严重的损害。目前广州郊区有些农民已经不愿意在菜地上加工加肥了，有的农民把蔬菜犁掉改种了别的作物。如果这种情况继续下去，蔬菜生产将会受到多大的影响，是可想而知的。
