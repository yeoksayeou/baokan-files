Xinhua News Agency, Rome, July 20th, TASS: The Italian Communist Party Press Bureau issued the following communiqué:

    "The leading organs of the Italian Communist Party held a meeting to hear the report from the Italian Communist Party delegation that recently visited Moscow. The delegation held long and friendly talks with the leaders of the Soviet Communist Party in Moscow. While praising the work of the delegation, the party's leading organs first expressed their great satisfaction with the harmonious atmosphere and the spirit of sincere friendship and mutual trust that permeated the talks. These talks confirmed the friendship and fraternal unity between the Soviet Communist Party and the Italian Communist Party, a friendship and unity based on Marxism-Leninism and the spirit of proletarian internationalism. The party's leading organs particularly reiterated that the Italian Communist Party fully agrees with the courageous and active activities undertaken by the leaders of the Soviet Communist Party in the past and present to completely overcome the consequences of the cult of Stalin in the Soviet Union and the international labor movement.
    The resolution of the Central Committee of the Soviet Communist Party on June 30 greatly helps to explain why the intolerable, long-standing and significant damage to democracy and the rule of law occurred in the Soviet Union, which has always maintained fundamentally democratic and socialist characteristics. This decision is also an effective contribution to the frank and open discussions taking place within the international labor movement in which our party is actively participating. This contact with the leaders of the Soviet Communist Party once again confirmed the spirit of fraternal solidarity, which is the cornerstone of the relationship between the communist parties of various countries that are struggling in their own specific environments to achieve democracy, peace and socialism."

    意共发表同苏共领导人会谈结果的公报 
    指出会谈证实了两党兄弟般的团结
    新华社20日讯　塔斯社罗马二十日讯：意大利共产党新闻局发表公报如下：
      “意大利共产党领导机构举行会议听取了最近访问莫斯科的意大利共产党代表团的报告。代表团在莫斯科同苏联共产党领导人进行了长时间的友好会谈。党的领导机构在赞许代表团工作的同时，首先对会谈中充满的融洽气氛以及真诚友谊和彼此信任的精神表示十分满意。这次会谈证实了苏联共产党和意大利共产党的友谊和兄弟般的团结，这种友谊和团结是以马克思列宁主义和无产阶级国际主义精神为基础的。党的领导机构特别重申：意大利共产党完全赞同苏联共产党领导人过去和现在为了完全克服对斯大林的崇拜在苏联和国际劳工运动中造成的后果而进行的勇敢和积极的活动。
    苏联共产党中央委员会六月三十日的决议大大有助于说明为什么在一向保持基本上是民主的和社会主义的特性的苏联发生了对民主和法制的不能容许的长期存在的重大的破坏。这个决定对于我们的党积极参与的国际劳工运动内部正在进行的坦率和公开的讨论也是一个有效的贡献。同苏联共产党领导人的这种接触再度证实了兄弟团结的精神，它是构成正在本国的具体环境中为实现民主、和平和社会主义而斗争的各国共产党之间的关系的基石。”
