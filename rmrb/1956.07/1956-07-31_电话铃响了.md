    The telephone rang
    *Ring! Ring!* The telephone at the Grape Orchard Maternal and Child Health Station rang. It was a call from 43 North River Bank, saying that Jiang Xuezhen was going into labor and they needed someone to come quickly to deliver the baby. Sha Yuwen, who was on duty, put down the phone, picked up the delivery kit that was already prepared, and left on a tricycle.
    Less than half an hour later, the phone rang again. Han Xiuzhi was going into labor, and Wang Xiliang, who was on duty, left immediately.
    After another hour or so, a call came from Xu Zhaoqin's house, and Si Qi, the last person on duty, also rushed to Xu Zhaoqin's house to deliver the baby.
    By this time, it was already midnight, and the staff at the health station were working hard to help with the births of the babies.
    The next morning at two or three o'clock, the staff of the health station returned one after another, tired, but everyone was excitedly talking about the situation of the babies they had delivered.
    They had just fallen asleep when the phone rang again.

    电话铃响了
    嘟！嘟嘟！葡萄园妇幼保健站的电话铃响了。这是北河沿四十三号打来的电话，说姜学珍要生产，要他们快去接生。值班的沙毓文放下电话，就提着早已准备好的接生箱，坐上三轮车就走了。
    不到半个钟头，电话铃又响了，韩秀芝要生孩子，值班的王希良又马上走了。
    又过一个多钟头，徐兆琴家来了电话，最后一个值班的似琦，也赶到徐兆琴家去接生。
    这时已经是午夜，保健站的工作人员正在为婴儿的出生紧张地劳动。
    第二天的早上两、三点钟，保健站的人员带着疲倦的身子陆续回来了，但是大家却兴高彩烈地谈论着自己接生的婴儿的情况。
    她们刚入睡，电话铃又响了。
