Xinhua News Agency, citing TASS, reported that the Soviet Supreme Soviet’s Fifth Session continued on July 13. On this day, the Union Council and the National Council concluded their discussions on the National Pension Law.

    At the meeting of the Union Council, Bulganin delivered a concluding speech. Bulganin said that the discussions and the amendments made by the Law Committees of the two houses had improved the National Pension Law. He believed that the conclusion that could be drawn from this discussion was that the National Pension Law was in accordance with the instructions of the 20th Congress of the CPSU and also in line with the interests of the working people.

    Bulganin said that the pension law aroused the interest and creative initiative of the working people. The discussion of the National Pension Law once again proved the profound and unbreakable connection that exists between the Party, the government, and the people.

    Bulganin then talked about the review of many amendments and suggestions. He specifically listed some acceptable amendments and explained that some amendments and suggestions were unacceptable.

    Bulganin concluded by saying that after the passage of this law, the Soviet Union would add 13 billion rubles of expenditure, which shows the prosperity of the Soviet economy and that all the work of the Soviet Party and government is subordinate to the interests of the people.

    In the two days of discussions in the Union Council and the National Council, the representatives expressed their approval of the law and put forward many amendments and supplements to it. Speakers pointed out that the new law fundamentally improved the pension system.
