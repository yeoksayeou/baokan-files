    Hoping for More Brown Sugar Production
    Our people have always had the habit of eating brown sugar. Women eat brown sugar after giving birth, the elderly drink brown sugar in winter to nourish their bodies, and some traditional Chinese medicines also use brown sugar as a medicinal guide. Ethnic minorities are accustomed to making tea with brown sugar, and people in Hunan and other places bring brown sugar as gifts when visiting relatives and friends. However, brown sugar is not available in many places now. This is mainly because the output of brown sugar is too small. White sugar is overstocked in Guangdong, Hunan, Hubei, Henan, Jiangxi and other provinces, while brown sugar is not enough to sell. Guangdong is the region with the highest sugar consumption. According to the statistics of the sugar company, the sales of white sugar in the first half of the year only completed 33% of the annual plan. Therefore, I suggest that the local and central sugar industry leading departments should, according to the people's habits and tastes, appropriately increase the production of brown sugar in the upcoming sugar extraction season.

    希望多生产一些红糖
    我国人民向来有吃红糖的习惯。妇女生孩子吃红糖，老年人冬季喝红糖补养身体，有些中药也用红糖做药引子。少数民族习惯用红糖泡茶，湖南等地人民带上红糖当礼物串亲访友。但是，现在很多地方买不到红糖。这主要是红糖的产量太少。广东、湖南、湖北、河南、江西等省的白糖有积压，红糖不够卖。广东是吃糖最多的地区，据糖业公司的统计，上半年销出去的白糖，仅仅完成全年计划的33％。所以，我建议：地方和中央制糖工业领导部门，应该根据人民的习惯和口味，在即将到来的榨糖季节里，适当地增加红糖产量。
