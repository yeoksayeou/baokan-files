Artificial insemination is a good way to breed cattle and pigs
Professor Wang Pijian, Guangxi Agricultural College

    In order to massively breed hybrid cattle and increase milk production to supply the needs of urban and industrial workers and support national industrial construction, the Guangxi Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial Department of Agriculture assigned us a task in October 1952. We were to select a pilot site in Lingui County to carry out artificial insemination work, using purebred bulls to crossbreed with local yellow cows in rural areas, and to draw conclusions by the end of that year.

    At that time, there was a shortage of technical personnel, the equipment was simple, and the masses of farmers were distrustful. Under these circumstances, it was indeed a daunting task to carry out artificial insemination of yellow cattle in rural areas and draw conclusions in just over two months. However, we did not succumb to the difficulties. We first carried out key pilot work on artificial insemination of yellow cattle in Liangfeng, Dalian, and Zhoujia townships in Lingui County. To carry out this work, the first problem that had to be solved was the issue of cadres. The Department of Agriculture transferred a dozen or so technical cadres from various special districts, gave them a short period of training, and then started work. After the work started, the next extremely detailed and complex task was to mobilize the masses. Farmers are most concerned with practicality. They will not easily believe anything unless they are presented with ironclad facts. Therefore, we held practical exhibitions and technical operation demonstrations. Some farmers, after watching the technical operation demonstrations, said, "Finding the 'flower' (referring to the cervix) and then putting the lively sperm inside, how could this not result in pregnancy?" However, there were still some people who couldn't understand this. Some farmers said, "Since the beginning of time, no one has ever heard of using artificial means to produce calves!" Some farmers called us "cow lords" when they saw us. They not only did not believe us, but also looked down on our work.

    This is the inevitable process of the development of new things. In order to get through to the farmers' minds and establish emotional connections with them, we lived with them in the villages. To keep track of cows in heat, we patrolled the cattle pens in the early morning and evening, and watched the pastures during the day. To grasp the correct insemination period, we sometimes got up in the middle of the night to inseminate. Many farmers witnessed our work firsthand, and they went from disbelief to supporting our work. Some farmers often ran to report to our working comrades in the middle of the night when their cows were "walking on grass" (referring to being in heat).

    At the end of the year, we did some statistics. In just over two months, we had inseminated more than ninety cows. Through these two months of work, we gained a lot of experience. We sorted out these experiences and continued to work on this basis. The conception rate was 74.05% in the first year, 94.47% in the second year, and 89.93% in the third year.

    Over the past few years, more than nine hundred hybrid cattle have been produced and distributed throughout the province. These hybrid cattle grow fast and are large in size. A shorthorn hybrid cow raised by Wen Kuanxi in Liangfeng Street weighed about 400 jin at one year old, as big as a local adult yellow cow. The working ability of hybrid bulls is 30% higher than that of local yellow cattle; the milk production of hybrid cows can reach a maximum of 48 jin per day.

    After carrying out artificial insemination work on cattle, in order to develop the pig-raising industry, we also started artificial insemination work on pigs in May last year.

    Regarding the issue of artificial insemination in pigs, some people believe that: collecting semen from boars is difficult and time-consuming, and natural mating is more straightforward. At the same time, the amount of semen required for sows is large, and each semen collection can only inseminate two to three sows. The reproductive rate of pigs is already very high, good boars are easy to obtain, and the conception rate of natural mating is also very high, so there is no need to apply artificial insemination. In this view, artificial insemination in pigs seems to be a meaningless task. However, many problems are facing us that need to be solved urgently: (1) Many areas in Guangxi Province are currently experiencing infectious abortion in pigs. If natural mating is allowed, the spread of infection will inevitably expand, which will pose a great threat to the safety of humans and animals; (2) At present, most of the pig mating work is carried out by private mating households. Because they have a strong profit motive and seek their own convenience, they raise small boars for mating and start mating too early, with unlimited mating times. How can this not seriously affect the conception rate and the vitality of offspring? (3) At present, the government has established many mating stations. When the masses see that a sow is in heat, they carry it to the mating station for mating, regardless of the distance, sometimes traveling dozens of miles back and forth. This not only wastes time and manpower, but also affects the development of mating services; (4) Most of the purebred boars raised by mating stations are very large in size. When mating with local sows, because the size difference between the boars and sows is too great, mating is very troublesome, or even unsuccessful. If these problems are not solved, it will seriously affect the development of the pig-raising industry. To solve these problems, artificial insemination is the best way.

    When we started artificial insemination work on pigs, due to lack of work experience and inadequate preparation of tools, it took three people and two hours to collect semen each time, and sometimes we ended up covered in mud and in a mess. Later, we improved the semen collection tools and methods, and used a dummy sow as a "platform pig." As a result, each semen collection only required one person, and the semen collection time was greatly shortened. By improving the feeding management of boars, increasing the yield and quality of semen, and conducting in-depth research on the optimal amount of semen for each insemination, the number of sows that can be inseminated per semen collection has greatly increased. According to our experience, on average, each semen collection can inseminate 6.5-10.8 sows. In this way, if each boar is collected 120 times throughout the year, it can inseminate 780-1,296 sows, which is 5.5-9.8 times higher than natural mating (natural mating is also calculated at 120 times a year). According to our calculation of 324 sows inseminated from May to December last year, the conception rate was as high as 91.49%. In addition, the method of artificial insemination can be used by inseminators to carry semen to the countryside and carry out insemination in the vast rural areas. This eliminates the trouble for farmers of carrying sows to the mating station for mating, and will inevitably be welcomed by the broad masses of farmers. However, to do this, the technology must be taught to the masses and the masses must be trained as inseminators. We have done this in the past, and the results have been quite good. According to our statistics, five farmer inseminators used artificial insemination to mate sixty-four sows, and the conception rate reached 93.75%. In this way, since artificial insemination is welcomed by the masses and the technology can be mastered by the masses, it can naturally be vigorously developed. The Liangfeng Livestock Artificial Insemination Station, with only three boars, inseminated 489 sows from January to March this year, which is much more than the total number inseminated from May to December last year. From this, it can be seen that artificial insemination is indeed a "more, faster, better, and more economical" method of pig breed improvement and reproduction. In addition to continuing to improve the conception rate and the number of inseminated sows on the existing basis, we are also learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and applying double mating and heterospermic insemination methods to increase the litter size and vitality of offspring, so that each litter of piglets is born more and larger, to meet the increasingly urgent needs of the broad masses of people for meat products. At the same time, we also plan to gradually promote pig artificial insemination technology throughout the province this year, so that the pig-raising industry in the province can develop more rapidly.

    人工授精是繁殖牛猪的好办法
    广西农学院教授　王丕建
    为了大量繁殖杂种牛，提高产乳量，以供应城市及工矿区劳动人民的需要，支援国家工业建设，1952年10月间中共广西省省委及省农业厅交给我们一项任务，要我们在临桂县选择试点，进行人工授精工作，应用纯种公牛在农村中和本地母黄牛杂交，并要我们在当年底得出结论。
    当时技术干部缺乏，仪器设备简陋，加上农民群众不相信，在这种情况下，要在农村中展开黄牛人工授精工作，而且在两个多月内得出结论，这个任务的确是艰巨的。但是，我们并没有向困难低头，我们先在临桂县的良丰、大联、周家三个乡进行了黄牛人工授精的重点试办工作。要进行这个工作，干部是首先必须解决的问题。农业厅从各专区抽调了十几个技术干部，进行了一个短时期的训练就开始工作。工作开始以后，接着需要进行的一个极其细致、复杂的工作就是发动群众。农民最讲究实际，没有铁一般的事实摆在他们面前，他们是不会轻易相信的。因此，我们就举行了实物展览和技术操作表演。有的农民看了技术操作表演后，就说：“找到了花（指子宫颈）再把活跳跳的精子放进去，这怎么会不受胎呢？”可是，仍然有一部分群众对这件事情想不通，有的农民说：“盘古开天辟地以来，从未听说过用人工可以配出牛仔来！”有的农民见了我们就叫“牛公”。他们不但不相信，而且轻视我们的工作。
    这是新事物发展必经的过程。为了打通农民的思想，和他们建立感情，我们就在乡村里和农民住在一起。为了掌握发情牛，我们早晚巡牛栏，白天看牧场。为了掌握正确的输精期，有时我们三更半夜起来输精。许多农民亲眼看到我们的工作，他们由不相信而变为支持我们的工作。有的农民在牛走草（指发情）的时候，常常在半夜里跑来向我们的工作同志报告。
    到年底的时候我们统计了一下，两个多月来共配了九十多头牛。通过这两个多月的工作，我们获得了不少的经验。我们把这些经验整理出来，就在这个基础上继续搞下去，第一年受胎率为74.05％，第二年94.47％，第三年为89.93％。
    几年来，杂种牛已经生产了九百多头，分布在省内各地。这些杂种牛生长快，体格大。良丰街文宽喜所养的一头短角杂种母牛，一岁时体重就达到四百斤左右，和当地成年母黄牛一样大。杂种公牛的耕作能力较本地黄牛高出30％；杂种母牛的产乳量，最高每日达四十八市斤。
    在进行了牛的人工授精工作以后，为了发展养猪事业，我们又在去年五月间展开了猪的人工授精工作。
    关于猪的人工授精问题，有的人认为：公猪采精困难费时，不如自然配种直截了当，同时，母猪所需要的输精量多，每采精一次仅可配二至三头母猪，猪的繁殖率本来就很高，良种公猪易得，而且自然配种受胎率也很高，因此没有应用人工授精的必要。这样看来，猪的人工授精似乎是一件毫无意义的工作。但是，摆在我们面前的许多问题亟待我们去解决：（1）广西省目前有许多地区发生猪的传染性流产病，如任其自然配种，势必扩大传染，对于人畜安全都会受到很大威胁；（2）目前猪的配种工作绝大部分地区是由民营配种户进行，由于他们赢利观点浓厚，并贪图自己方便，多养小公猪来配种，同时初配年龄过早，配种次数漫无限制，这样，怎么能不严重地影响受胎率和后代的生活力？（3）目前政府设立许多配种站，群众看见母猪发情，不论远近都要抬来配种，有时往返几十里路，这样，不但浪费了时间和人力，而且影响配种业务的开展；（4）大多数配种站所养的纯种公猪体格很大，和本地母猪进行配种时，因为公母猪体格相差悬殊，配种非常麻烦，甚或失配。如果这些问题不解决，就会严重地影响养猪事业的发展。要解决这些问题，采用人工授精就是最好的办法。
    在开始进行猪的人工授精工作的时候，由于工作经验缺乏，用具准备不周，每次采精需要三个人，两个钟头才可采到，甚至有时弄得满身泥巴，狼狈不堪，后来改进了采精用具和方法，应用假母猪为台猪，结果每次采精只需要一个人就行了，而且采精时间也大大缩短了。由于改进了公猪的饲养管理，提高了精液的产量和质量，并深入研究每次输精的最适量，因此采精一次可配的母猪头数大大增加了。根据我们的经验，平均每采精一次可配母猪6.5—10.8头次。这样，如果每头公猪全年采精120次，则可配母猪780—1，296头次，比较自然配种，提高了5.5—9.8倍（自然配种也按一年配120次计）。根据我们去年五至十二月所配的324头母猪计算，受胎率高达91.49％。此外，采用人工授精的方法，可以由输精员携带精液下乡在广大的农村中进行输精，这样就消除了农民抬母猪来配种站配种的麻烦，必然会受到广大农民群众的欢迎；但是，要这样做，必须把技术交给群众，培养群众为输精员。我们过去曾经这样做过，效果相当良好。根据我们的统计，五个农民输精员用人工配种六十四头母猪，受胎率竟达93.75％。这样，人工授精既然为群众所欢迎，技术又能为群众所掌握，那自然就可以得到蓬蓬勃勃的开展。良丰家畜人工授精站，仅养三头公猪，今年一至三月份便配了489头母猪，比去年五至十二月份所配的总头数还多得多。由此可见人工授精确是猪种改良繁殖的一种“又多、又快、又好、又省”的办法。我们现在除在原有基础上继续提高受胎率及配种头数以外，并学习苏联先进经验，应用双重配种和异质精液授精的方法来提高产仔率和后代生活力，使每窝猪仔生得又多又大，以适应广大人民对于肉产品日益迫切的需要。同时，我们还计划今年在全省范围内逐步推广猪的人工授精技术，使全省养猪事业得到更迅速的发展。
