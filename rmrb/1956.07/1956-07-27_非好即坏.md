    Either Good or Bad
    You Yi
    When children watch plays, they often ask, "Is this a good guy or a bad guy?"
    Children's minds are simple, either good or bad. They don't have the ability to analyze complex phenomena.
    To put it bluntly, some critics have minds as simple as children. When it comes to classical works, their conclusions are often either anti-feudal or promoting feudal ideology; either realistic or anti-realistic. Works that fall between these two extremes seem not to exist.
    Liang Shanbo's love suicide is easy to understand; Chen Shimei's abandonment of Qin Xianglian is also easy to understand. But Cai Bojie's attitude towards Zhao Wuniang is hard to understand, so doubts arise, and it's difficult to conclude whether Cai Bojie is a positive or negative character.
    Traditional Chinese painters emphasize "five shades of ink," being able to distinguish various depths and gradations within a single black color. But some critics only have black and white as standards. They don't know that good people can be good in various ways, and bad people can be bad in various ways. As for those who are neither good nor bad, critics find it even more difficult to deal with.

    非好即坏

    孩子看戏，常常问：“这是好人，还是坏人？”
    孩子的头脑是简单的，非好即坏，他们没有能力来分析那些复杂的现象。
    说句不客气的话，有些批评家具有和孩子同样简单的头脑，一谈到古典作品，结论常常不是反封建，就是宣传封建思想；不是现实主义就是反现实主义，介乎这两极中间的作品似乎并不存在。
    梁山伯的殉情，容易理解；陈世美的遗弃秦香莲，也容易理解；可是蔡伯喈对赵五娘的态度就不好理解了，于是疑问重重，连蔡伯喈是正面人物还是反面人物的结论都不大好下。
    国画家讲究“墨分五色”，在一种黑色里都能分出各种深浅不同的层次，而某些批评家的标准却只有黑白两种颜色。他们不知道好人有各种不同的好法，坏人有各种不同的坏法。至于对那些不好不坏的人，批评家就更难办了。
