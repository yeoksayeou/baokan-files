In the days leading up to the third anniversary of the Korean Armistice—on a clear morning in July—I arrived on an island in the West Korean Bay to visit a certain coastal defense unit of the Chinese People's Volunteers stationed there. This unit was awarded a prize banner by the leading organs of the Volunteer Army in May of this year for its outstanding completion of the task of guarding the coast.

For several years, the soldiers of this unit have patrolled and stood guard day and night along a coastline of fifty or sixty li, giving the enemy no gap to exploit. I had a discussion with the soldiers of a patrol group. Group leader Chen Zenghu and his two group members patrol the rugged coastline for three or four hours every night, climbing up and down; when they return, their clothes are often soaked with sweat or dew as if they had been drenched in heavy rain. Sometimes, when they are carrying out an ambush mission, they encounter heavy snow or rain, but this does not affect their determination to carry out the mission in the slightest. When I expressed my respect for their spirit of enduring hardship, Chen Zenghu immediately replied: "Completing the task comes first, a little hardship is nothing!" One day at noon, platoon leader Li Changjiang led me to visit an observation post located on a hilltop 250 meters above sea level. On the wooden wall of the small and hidden observation shed was a slogan with eight large characters: "Raise Vigilance, Stick to the Post." That night, I saw the working conditions of the observers: the night was pitch black, and a thick fog surrounded the island. The observer on duty, Fan Zhengrong, wearing a leather coat, attentively listened and observed the movements on the vast sea, and quickly reported any suspicious circumstances to the command.

While vigilantly guarding the island, the officers and soldiers of this unit are also constantly striving to improve their ability to defend peace. Five squads and platoons achieved collective excellent results in military, political, and cultural studies last winter, and have been awarded prize banners and commendations by higher authorities.

The task of the island garrison is arduous and difficult, but the officers and soldiers have arranged their lives happily and orderly. When the unit first arrived on the island, the war had just ended, and the Korean people who had moved out of the island were returning to their homes. Everywhere there were collapsed houses, the cultivated land was overgrown with weeds, and bushes blocked the roads. However, after several years of hard work by the Korean residents on the island and the officers and soldiers of the Volunteer Army, the island has shown a new face. The unit not only helped the Korean residents rebuild their homes, but also divided part of the reclaimed wasteland to Korean farmers for cultivation. The unit repaired roads, renovated dilapidated barracks, and planted more than ten kinds of vegetables on the reclaimed wasteland, harvesting 200,000 jin last year alone. Some units also raised livestock such as pigs, dogs, chickens, and cats. Each unit also frequently holds small sports meets or entertainment evenings. Every deep winter, the frozen seawater separates the land from the island, and for several months, the unit's supply of materials is greatly restricted. Instructor Wang Qingchun introduced to me the situation of the soldiers in their company during the past winter. He said: In those four or five months, the unit could not see movies, nor could they see new newspapers and magazines. The soldiers in each squad and platoon used the company's radio to listen to news from the motherland. The squads performing tasks at the outposts sent representatives to the company to copy news and then report the good news of the motherland's construction to their comrades. The company club also often organized amateur soldier performance teams, bringing gongs, drums, and radios, to visit and comfort the soldiers at the outpost squads. Soldiers in some squads also made models of major industrial and mining enterprises in the motherland in the sand table for exhibition, which greatly encouraged everyone.

    志愿军紧守在保卫和平岗位上
    新华社记者　冶峰
    在朝鲜停战三周年的前些日子——七月的一个晴朗的早晨，记者到达西朝鲜湾的一个海岛上访问了驻守在这里的中国人民志愿军某海防部队。这支部队因为出色地完成了守卫海防的任务，今年五月，曾经受到志愿军领导机关授予奖旗的奖励。
    几年来，这支部队的战士们，日日夜夜在长达五、六十华里的海岸线上巡逻放哨，不给敌人任何空隙可钻。记者和一个巡逻小组的战士们进行过座谈。组长陈增和领导他的两个组员，每个晚上在崎岖的海岸线上翻下爬上巡逻三、四个小时，归来时，衣服常常被汗水或露水浸湿得如同大雨浇过一样。有时候，正在执行潜伏任务，忽然大雪大雨，但一点也不影响他们执行任务的决心。当我对他们这种吃苦精神表示尊敬时，陈增和立刻答道：“完成任务第一，吃点苦算不了什么！”一天中午，排长李长江领我参观了一个设在一座高出海面二百五十公尺的山头上的观察所。在小而隐蔽的观察棚的木墙上贴着一幅标语，上面的八个大字是：“提高警惕、坚守岗位。”这天晚上，我看到了观察员的工作情形：夜是乌黑的，大雾包围了海岛，值班的观察员范正荣穿着皮大衣，聚精会神地倾听和观察着辽阔的海面上的动静，迅速地向指挥机关报告了可疑的情况。
    这支部队的官兵们在警惕守卫海岛的同时，也不断地努力提高自己保卫和平的本领。有五个班、排在去年冬季的军事、政治和文化学习中取得了集体优良的成绩，已经分别得到上级机关授给奖旗和通报嘉奖。
    守岛部队的任务是繁重艰苦的，但官兵们却把自己的生活安排得愉快而有秩序。在部队初到岛上的时候，战争刚刚结束，搬出海岛的朝鲜人民正在重返家园，到处是倒坍的房舍，耕地上长满了杂草，灌木丛挡住了道路，但是，经过岛上朝鲜居民和志愿军部队官兵几年的辛勤劳动，海岛已显出了新的面貌。部队不但帮助朝鲜居民重建家园，而且把开垦的一部分荒地分给朝鲜农民耕种。部队整修了公路，翻修了破旧的营房，在开垦的荒地上种植了十多种蔬菜，光是去年就收获了二十万斤。有些单位还饲养了猪、狗、鸡、猫等家畜。各单位还经常举行小型的运动会或文娱晚会。每到深冬，结了冰的海水把陆地和海岛隔开，有几个月的时间，部队的物资供应受到很大限制。指导员王庆春向我介绍了他们连里的战士们度过去年冬天的情形。他说：在那四、五个月内，部队看不到电影，看不到新的报纸杂志，各个班排的战士们就利用连内的收音机收听祖国的新闻。在前哨点执行任务的班，派代表到连内抄写新闻后，回去向战友们报告祖国建设的喜讯。连俱乐部也时常组织士兵业余演出队，带上锣鼓和收音机，去慰问前哨班的战士们。有些班的战士们还在沙盘内做出祖国重大工矿、企业的模型进行展览，这对大家的鼓舞很大。
