    Shorter Work Hours for Sales Clerks
    Work Efficiency Improved, Merchandise Losses Reduced, and Fewer Errors

    Xinhua News Agency News: In five of the eight branch stores of the Nan'an District Store, which belongs to the Chongqing Municipal Trade Company, employees now work eight hours a day, reduced from over ten hours previously, while business hours remain unchanged. After shortening the work hours, work efficiency has significantly improved, manpower has been reduced, turnover has increased, and errors have decreased.

    In the past, the leading cadres of this store emphasized that commercial work was unique and that work hours could not be shortened. As a result, employees often worked overtime, affecting their health. In May of this year, the store's employees sharply criticized the leading cadres for this. The store's leading cadres then personally went down to investigate and sent special personnel to assist the employees in solving the problem of excessive work hours. The non-staple food group of the Qiaojiaotuo branch store, with three employees managing 272 kinds of non-staple foods and daily necessities, used to work eleven to twelve hours a day, sometimes without a single day off in a month. However, their work was still chaotic, with large merchandise losses and many errors. During the discussion on shortening work hours, the employees found that the excessive work hours were due to the lack of understanding of the busy and slack periods of business and unreasonable labor organization. They decided that during busy times, all three would work together, and during slack times, they would take turns resting. The trial results showed that working eight hours a day not only allowed them to complete their work but also to do it well. The group's turnover in June increased by 24% compared to April, the merchandise loss rate decreased by 37% compared to April, errors were completely eliminated, and sanitation was also improved. Shelves that had not been cleaned for years were thoroughly washed, and the group transformed from a backward group into an advanced one.

    In order to ensure that employees have sufficient rest time, various branch stores have also streamlined meetings. The Longmenhao branch store combined life review meetings with business meetings, addressing problems as they arose. As a result, there were fewer meetings, and employees had time to study culture and participate in recreational activities.

### 缩短了营业员的工作时间  工作效率提高，商品损耗率下降，差错减少

    缩短了营业员的工作时间
    工作效率提高，商品损耗率下降，差错减少
    新华社讯　重庆市贸易公司南岸区商店所属八个门市部中的五个门市部的职工，现在每天的工作时间已从十小时以上减少到八小时，而对外营业时间没有缩短。缩短工时以后，工作效率显著提高，还减少了人力，营业额上升，差错反而减少。
    这个商店的领导干部过去强调商业工作特殊，不能缩短工作时间。因此职工们经常加班加点，影响健康。今年五月间，商店的职工为此曾经对领导干部提出了尖锐的批评。商店领导干部便亲自下去检查，并且派出专人协助职工解决了工时过长的问题。窍角沱门市部的副食品小组，三个职工经营着两百七十二种副食品和日用杂品，过去他们每天工作十一小时到十二小时，有时一个月也得不到一天例假休息，但工作还是混乱，商品损耗大、差错多。在讨论缩短工时中，职工们找出工时过长是由于没有掌握营业忙闲规律和劳动组织不合理所致，决定在忙时三人一起上班，闲时轮换休息。试行结果，每天八小时工作不但能做完事，而且能把事情做好。这个小组六月份的营业额比四月份上升24％，商品损耗率比四月份下降37％，完全消灭了差错，清洁卫生工作也有改进，几年没洗过的货架，也洗得干干净净，从落后小组变成了先进小组。
    各门市部为了保证职工有足够的休息时间，还精简了会议。龙门浩门市部把生活检讨会同业务会议结合在一起，有什么问题解决什么问题。这样，会议少了，职工们就有了时间学习文化和参加文娱活动。
