    Strange “Dual-Purpose Glue”
    In order to better preserve our archival materials and prevent them from being damaged by starch rot and corrosion caused by using paste for pasting, our organization specially purchased a batch of Heping (Peace) brand glue produced by the Qingdao Jianning Industrial Cooperative from the department store in early June, at a price several times higher than ordinary paste. Unexpectedly, this glue can also manage fading, and is even more powerful than ordinary "fading agents." When the glue touches words written in blue ink, the handwriting fades, and even words printed in oil-based ink can be faded. The original intention was to better preserve archival materials, but using this strange "dual-purpose glue" has instead made many archival materials incomplete.

    奇怪的“两用胶水”
    我们机关为了更好地保存档案材料，不让档案材料因用浆糊粘贴而受淀粉霉烂腐蚀的损失，在六月初特地用比普通浆糊高好几倍的价钱，从百货公司买了一批青岛建宁工业社出品的和平牌胶水。不料这种胶水竟能兼管退色，而且比一般“退色灵”还要厉害，胶水碰上用蓝墨水写的字，字迹就退了，甚至用油墨印的字也能退掉。原意是要更好地保管档案材料，用了这种奇怪的“两用胶水”，反而使许多档案材料变得不完整了。
