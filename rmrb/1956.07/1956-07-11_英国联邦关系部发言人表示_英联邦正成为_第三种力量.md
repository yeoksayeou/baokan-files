Xinhua News Agency, 10th. According to a United Press International report from London: A spokesman for the British Commonwealth Relations Office said on July 9th that the recently concluded Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference had convinced those attending that the Commonwealth was acting as an invisible "third force" to bridge the gap between East and West. The official said that although the prime ministers were still opposed to calling it a "third force," the Commonwealth was "more or less playing that role."

The UPI report said that the main issue "discussed at the Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference was the Soviet Russian issue." Because Nehru, Eden, and Pearson expressed their views on the Soviet Union, the Commonwealth now believes that the Soviet Union's policy of peaceful coexistence is sincere.

The report said: "The Commonwealth Prime Ministers are unconsciously convinced that they can bring Communists and non-Communists together if they work together for this purpose."

Xinhua News Agency, 10th. Ottawa Message: Canadian Prime Minister St. Laurent said to the House of Commons on July 9th when reporting on the Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference that the issue of diplomatic recognition of China was fully discussed at the meeting.

St. Laurent said: "The Asian members of the Commonwealth emphasized the importance to Asia of allowing China, the largest country in Asia, to receive universal formal recognition and the opportunity to play a role in the United Nations." St. Laurent stated that although the Canadian government recognizes the value of this argument, it does not believe that there are strong reasons to change its policy of non-recognition of China at this time.

In his report, St. Laurent said that the policies currently pursued by the Soviet Union provide opportunities to improve East-West relations and resolve disputes between East and West. However, he also said that the danger of war has not been eliminated, and the West must continue to maintain strong armed forces.

    英国联邦关系部发言人表示
    英联邦正成为“第三种力量”
    新华社10日讯　据合众社伦敦消息：英国联邦关系部的发言人七月九日说，刚刚闭幕的英联邦总理会议已经使参加会议的人相信，英联邦正作为一种看不见的“第三种力量”来沟通东西方之间的鸿沟。这个官员说，虽然总理们仍然反对称它为“第三种力量”，但是英联邦“多少是起这样的作用的”。
    合众社这条消息说，联邦总理会议“讨论的主要问题是苏俄问题”。由于尼赫鲁、艾登和皮尔逊表示了对苏联的看法，英联邦现在开始觉得苏联的和平共处的政策是真诚的。
    这条消息说：“联邦总理们不知不觉地深信，他们能够把共产党人和非共产党人拉在一起，如果他们为这个目的而一致努力的话。”
    据新华社10日讯　渥太华消息：加拿大总理圣劳伦七月九日在向众议院报告英联邦总理会议的情况时说，在这个会议上，对外交上承认中国的问题，曾经作了充分的讨论。
    圣劳伦说：“英联邦的亚洲成员们强调让亚洲最大的国家中国得到普遍的正式承认和在联合国内起作用的机会对亚洲的重要性。”圣劳伦表示，加拿大政府虽然承认这种论点是有价值的，但是它认为目前还没有强有力的理由改变它的不承认中国的政策。
    圣劳伦在报告中说，苏联目前实行的政策为改善东西方关系和解决东西方之间的争执问题提供了机会。但是他同时又说，战争的危险还没有消除，西方必须继续保有强大的武装力量。
