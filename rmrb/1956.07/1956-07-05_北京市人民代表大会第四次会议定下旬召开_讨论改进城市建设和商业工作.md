    Xinhua News Agency, July 4th—The 15th meeting of the Beijing Municipal People's Committee, held today, decided to convene the Fourth Session of the First Beijing Municipal People's Congress in late July. The session is scheduled to discuss and approve the final accounts of Beijing's 1955 financial revenue and expenditure and the budget for 1956, as well as to discuss how to improve urban construction and commercial work, among other issues.

    The Municipal People's Committee meeting believes that these three topics are very important, especially the two issues of urban construction and commercial work, which are directly related to the daily lives of the people and are of great concern to the masses and representatives. In order to better listen to the opinions of the broad masses and improve these two tasks, the meeting hopes that the People's Representatives will use their spare time to conduct inspection work on these three issues to be discussed for two to three weeks, so as to put forward suggestions at the congress.
