Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, July 19th: A Western Zhou Dynasty architectural mound site has been excavated at Yangzishan near Chengdu. The base of this site is approximately 104 meters on each side, and the mound is 12 meters high, constructed entirely of mud bricks.

Buried on top of the mound were numerous ancient tombs from the Warring States period to the Qin, Han, and Jin dynasties. The cultural relics unearthed from the ancient tombs include bronze ware, jade ware, lacquerware, various patterned portrait bricks, iron farm tools, stone carvings, pottery figurines and sculptures, and porcelain, totaling approximately several thousand pieces from the aforementioned periods.

At the base of this mound, fragments of stone disks, stone axes, and a wide variety of pottery shards were discovered. These items may be relics from the Paleolithic or Neolithic periods.

The head of the Sichuan Provincial Cultural Relics Management Committee told Xinhua News Agency reporters: The Yangzishan excavation is a large-scale discovery of ancient cultural relics dating back to before the Qin and Han dynasties since the liberation of Sichuan. Because there is very little pre-Qin and Han cultural relic data in Sichuan, these cultural relics provide rich and extremely valuable physical data for the study of ancient Sichuan history.

This discovery and excavation began in early 1954 due to a brick factory's capital construction project. After more than two years, the excavation work was initially completed in February of this year. Currently, the Sichuan Provincial Cultural Relics Management Committee is identifying, organizing, and repairing the unearthed cultural relics, and is conducting a comprehensive summary of the Yangzishan excavation work.

    成都近郊发现西周土台建筑遗址
    新华社成都19日电　一座西周时代的土台建筑遗址在成都近郊羊子山被发掘出来。这个遗址的底层每边约一零四公尺，台高十二公尺全部由泥砖砌成。
    在土台上面埋有从战国以至秦、汉、晋等时代的许多古墓。古墓中出土的文物有上述各时代的铜器、玉器、漆器、各种图样的画像砖、铁制农具、石刻、陶俑和雕塑、瓷器等共约数千件。
    在这个土台底层又发现下面埋有一部分石璧、石斧残片和多种多样的陶片等。这些东西可能是属于旧石器或新石器时代的遗物。
    四川省文物管理委员会负责人向新华社记者说：羊子山的发掘是四川解放后对秦、汉以前古代文物的一次大规模发现。由于四川在秦、汉以前的文物资料很少，这些文物就为四川古代历史的研究提供了丰富的极有价值的实物资料。
    这次的发现和发掘，是在1954年初由于一个砖瓦厂进行基本建设工程而开始的，经过两年多的时间，到今年2月才初步结束了发掘工作。现在，四川省文物管理委员会正在把出土的文物加以鉴别、整理、修补，并对羊子山的发掘工作进行全面总结。
