Xinhua News Agency, 23rd dispatch from Tokyo: The Japanese "Yomiuri Shimbun" reported that Japan's largest trading companies, which in the past did not openly trade with China, are stepping up plans to conduct open and direct trade with China.
    The newspaper said that major import companies, as well as Mitsubishi Corporation, First Bussan, Itochu Trading, Nissho, Toyo Cotton, and Nichimen Jitsugyo, are all shifting the focus of their trade plans from Taiwan to mainland China. In the past, many trading companies traded with China secretly through dummy companies.
    The "Yomiuri Shimbun" believes that the signs of easing Cold War tensions and the greater stability of the Chinese market are encouraging this trend.

    日本许多大贸易公司
    计划和中国直接贸易
    新华社23日讯　东京消息：日本“读卖新闻”报道，过去不和中国公开贸易的日本最大贸易公司正在加紧计划和中国进行公开的直接的贸易。
    这家报纸说，各大进口公司和三菱商事、第一物产、伊藤忠商事、日商、东洋棉花、日棉实业等公司都把它们的贸易计划的重点从台湾转移到中国大陆。过去，许多贸易公司通过虚设的公司和中国秘密贸易。
    “读卖新闻”认为，鼓励这种趋势发展的是冷战紧张局势缓和的迹象，以及中国市场的更加稳定。
