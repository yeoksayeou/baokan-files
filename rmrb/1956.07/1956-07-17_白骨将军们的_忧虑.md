The "Worries" of the White-Boned Generals

    When Premier Zhou Enlai's speech on the peaceful liberation of Taiwan resounded around the world like spring thunder, in the Pentagon in Washington, the American white-boned generals, on the one hand, feigned calmness, using the so-called "same old tune," "nothing new" – the real "same old tune" – to deceive others and themselves. But they were "worried about the impact this speech would have within the Chiang Kai-shek clique and the support it might receive from neutral countries."

    It is not difficult to understand the "worries" of these robbers.

    In my childhood, I personally witnessed American-marked jeeps charging around in the land of my southwestern hometown; American "Flying Fortresses" defiling the clouds of the motherland in the sky; American soldiers with "Allied Forces in China" on their backs raping and plundering at will in the streets and alleys… all of this, under the "worries" of the white-boned generals in Washington, was ruthlessly swept out of mainland China by the iron broom of the Chinese people. All of this is now continuing in Taiwan. And Taiwan is an inseparable part of Chinese territory. The ultimate fate of the American soldiers in Taiwan will be no different from their experience on the mainland; they will inevitably be swept out by the Chinese people. Precisely because of this, as the possibility of peaceful liberation of Taiwan becomes greater day by day, it is no wonder that the white-boned generals are "worried."

    白骨将军们的“忧虑”
    当周恩来总理关于和平解放台湾的发言像春雷一样响彻了世界的时候，在华盛顿的五角大楼里，美国的白骨将军们一方面强作镇静，用所谓“老一套”、“没有新鲜东西”的真正的“老一套”来欺骗别人和自己。但是他们“对这个发言将会在蒋介石集团内部产生的影响以及它可能受到中立国家的支持”感到“忧虑”。
    强盗们的这种“忧虑”是不难理解的。
    小的时候，我亲眼看到涂着美国标记的吉普车在西南故乡的土地上横冲直撞；美国的“空中堡垒”在天空玷污着祖国的云彩；背上背着“来华盟军”的美国大兵在街头巷尾随便奸淫抢掠………这一切，都在华盛顿白骨将军们的“忧虑”之下，被中国人民的铁扫帚无情的扫出了中国大陆。这一切，现在正在台湾继续着。而台湾，它是中国领土不可分割的一部分。美国大兵们在台湾的最后结果决不会和大陆上的遭遇有两样的，他们必将被中国人民扫出去。正是这样，所以当和平解放台湾的可能一天比一天变得大起来的时候，白骨将军们就难怪要“忧虑”了。北京地质学院
