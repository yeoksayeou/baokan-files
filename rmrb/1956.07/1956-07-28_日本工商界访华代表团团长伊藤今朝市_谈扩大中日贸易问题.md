Xinhua News Agency, July 27th. Xinhua News Agency reporter interviewed Ito Asao, head of the Japanese Business and Industry Delegation to China, in Beijing today on the issue of expanding Sino-Japanese trade.

Ito Asao told the reporter, "For Japan, the expansion of Sino-Japanese trade is absolutely necessary." Ito Asao expressed interest in China's ongoing economic construction, especially the rapid increase in the purchasing power of China's rural areas.

Ito Asao said that the United States has taken various measures to restrict the import of Japanese textiles and other commodities, and has been pushing high-priced surplus agricultural products to Japan, forcing Japan to purchase munitions and weapons that the Japanese people do not need. The Japanese people are dissatisfied with this. He said that the soybeans the United States sells to Japan are both expensive and of poor quality.

Ito Asao also said that if Japan could break through the embargo and export ships and machinery to China, he believed that Sino-Japanese trade would experience "leapfrog development."

When discussing the issue of restoring Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations, Ito Asao excitedly said that if China and Japan could restore normal relations, trade between the two countries would also develop rapidly. Continuously expanding trade between China and Japan would help enhance the friendly relations and economic development of the two countries.

Ito Asao told the reporter that the trade talks had been proceeding smoothly. He hoped to visit various parts of China after the talks are concluded.

He said that what impressed him most about Beijing was that "its people are hopeful about the future."

    谈扩大中日贸易问题
    新华社27日讯　新华社记者今天就扩大中日贸易问题访问了正在北京的日本工商界访华代表团团长伊藤今朝市。
    伊藤今朝市对记者说：“对日本来说，中日贸易是非扩大不可的。”伊藤今朝市对中国正在进行的经济建设，特别是中国农村购买力的迅速提高感到兴趣。
    伊藤今朝市说，美国采取种种措施限制日本纺织品等商品进口，高价向日本推销剩余农产品，迫使日本购买日本人民所不需要的军火武器等，日本人民对此感到不满。他说，美国卖给日本的大豆价钱既高，质量又差。
    伊藤今朝市还说，假如日本能够突破禁运，向中国出口船舶和机器，他相信中日贸易将会得到“突飞猛进的发展”。
    谈到恢复中日邦交问题时，伊藤今朝市兴奋地说，假如中日两国能够恢复正常关系，两国的贸易也将会得到迅速的发展。不断地扩大中日两国贸易，有助于增强两国的友好关系和经济发展。
    伊藤今朝市向记者说，这次贸易商谈进行得很顺利。他希望在商谈结束后到中国各地参观访问。
    他说，北京给他印象最深的是：“它的人民对前途都抱有希望”。
