Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 11th: According to a report in "Vorwärts," American propaganda organs have recently intensified their intimidation propaganda against socialists in Europe, telling them not to cooperate with communists. American information offices in West Germany, France, Britain, Austria, Belgium, and other countries are carrying out such work.

It is learned from authoritative sources in Bonn that this work is being carried out according to special instructions prepared in Washington by experts from the United States Information Service and the State Department. This directive, approved by Theodore Streibert, Director of the United States Information Agency, and Secretary of State Dulles, calls for diverting the attention of the European public, especially socialists, from the Soviet Communist Party's peace initiatives. It demands that European socialists be intimidated with the notion that cooperation between European socialists and communists is fraught with "danger."

The directive specifically emphasizes the need to prepare and disseminate various materials that, according to American plans, should influence socialist leaders to prevent them from reconciling with communists.

"Vorwärts" said that Washington is trying to prevent socialists from establishing contact with communists because the United States is clearly very concerned about the prospect of possible improved relations between communists and socialists after the 20th Congress of the Soviet Communist Party. This improvement in relations would lead to cooperation in promoting the resolution of international problems, thus seriously hindering the United States from realizing its plans in Europe.

    美国宣传机关在西欧造谣挑拨
    企图阻挠社会党人同共产党人接触
    新华社柏林11日电　据“前进报”报道，美国宣传机关近来在欧洲加紧对社会党进行恫吓宣传，要他们不要同共产党人合作。在西德、法国、英国、奥地利、比利时和其他国家的美国新闻处都在进行这样的工作。
    从波恩的权威人士那里获悉，这个工作是根据美国新闻处和国务院专家在华盛顿准备的特别指示进行的。这个由美国国际宣传署署长西奥多·斯特雷伯特和国务卿杜勒斯批准的指示要求转移欧洲公众特别是社会党人对苏联共产党的和平行动的注意，要求用欧洲社会党人同共产党的合作充满了“危险”的这种说法，来恫吓欧洲社会党人。
    这个指示特别强调必须准备和散播各种材料，根据美国的计划，这些材料应对社会党领袖产生影响，使他们不同共产党人和解。
    “前进报”说，华盛顿力图阻挠社会党人同共产党人建立接触，因为美国显然对苏共第二十次代表大会以后的共产党人和社会党人之间关系可能改善的前景很担心，这种关系改善将引导到促进解决国际问题方面的合作，因而严重地妨碍美国实现它在欧洲的计划。
