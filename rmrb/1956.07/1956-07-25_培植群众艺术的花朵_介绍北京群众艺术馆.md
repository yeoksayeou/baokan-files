Cultivating Blossoms of Mass Art
——Introducing the Beijing Mass Art Center

A Bridge Between Artists and Art Enthusiasts

On the evening of July 8th, the China Youth Art Theater was brightly lit. Theater artists from the capital and actors from more than a hundred amateur theater organizations gathered here to watch three one-act plays performed by the Beijing Amateur Experimental Drama Troupe, the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant Amateur Troupe, and the China Youth Art Theater. This was the first joint performance of professional and amateur troupes organized by the Beijing Mass Art Center, the Chinese Dramatists Association, and the Working People's Cultural Palace. After the curtain fell, a symposium began. Theater enthusiasts from the production front and well-known directors and actors exchanged ideas cordially, establishing friendships with each other.

The Mass Art Center is a bridge between professional artists and amateur art enthusiasts. It frequently organizes theater artists, musicians, and dancers from the capital to go to factories, rural areas, and schools to meet with art enthusiasts and guide their artistic activities. Almost all professional art troupes in the capital have taken on the task of guiding amateur theater troupes in factories and mines and rural areas. The Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant Troupe, for example, has grown up with the help of the China Youth Art Theater and the Beijing Film Actors Troupe. Beijing has fifteen large choirs composed of workers, university and middle school students, children, government cadres, teachers, and others. Musicians are cultivating nearly three thousand mass singers in these amateur choirs.

Beijing's amateur art groups are not only very active in the capital, but have also begun to establish connections with fraternal amateur art groups internationally.

Farmer Singer Enters National Song and Dance Troupe

The Mass Art Center regards the cultivation of key members of mass amateur art as one of its main tasks. This work is undertaken by the amateur art school. Every evening and Sunday, many workers from factories and enterprises travel from different places to the amateur art school. Some are listening to experts' reports on various art knowledge, some are learning composition and conducting, some are learning new dance programs, some are concentrating on practicing sketching in front of plaster statues, and some are rehearsing new plays. They participate in learning not only to improve their artistic knowledge and skills, but more importantly to return to their units to carry out artistic activities. Over the past six years, this school has trained more than nine thousand active members of mass cultural and artistic activities. In addition, it has also cultivated many young amateur artists with special talents, some of whom have been recommended to professional art troupes or higher art academies for further study.

For example, Dong Zhenxing, a young farmer singer well-known in the Nanyuan area, has loved singing folk songs since he was a child. After liberation, his natural singing voice was developed under the cultivation of the amateur art school. He uses his beautiful, simple, and sonorous singing voice to sing about a happy life and to sing about his hometown that has changed its appearance. Not long ago, he successfully passed the entrance examination of the Central Song and Dance Troupe and was formally admitted as a member of the folk choir. From now on, he will receive further in-depth study and specialized training.

Sun Zhenhua and Wang Jishun, students of the music department of the amateur art school and worker composers, have created songs that are very popular among the masses.

In Beijing's newspapers and periodicals, one can often see paper cuttings and cartoons co-created by Zhang Heming, Hu Desheng, and Zhuang Ping. These three art enthusiasts have also been studying at the amateur art school for many years. Zhang Heming is a correspondent of a certain government agency, and he works hard on art creation in his spare time from his busy work. Recently, a paper cutting they are working on together will be sent to the Central Folk Art Museum of the German Democratic Republic as an exchange gift. Mao Fengde, a worker at the No. 1 Machine Tool Plant, has been selected to study at the Central Academy of Fine Arts because he has potential for development in art.

Summer Music and Dance Evening

In order to enrich the cultural life of the working people in the capital, the Mass Art Center holds music and dance evenings every summer, allowing audiences to spend enjoyable weekends and hot summer nights. At each evening, people can first enjoy the latest programs from major theaters, hear magnificent choruses, and also hear unique folk songs; they can enjoy performances by art troupes returning with honors from abroad, folk dances from various places, wonderful acrobatics, beautiful classical instrument performances, and hilarious comic dialogues... Some programs are not easily seen by the masses on weekdays. For example, the Chinese People's Liberation Army Military Band, the Central People's Broadcasting Station Broadcasting Orchestra, the National Orchestra, and the Central Newsreel and Documentary Film Studio Orchestra have all met with the audience at such evenings.

This evening also opens up a venue for amateur art groups to perform. Many excellent programs of the masses are welcomed by the audience. In order to help tens of thousands of amateur art enthusiasts improve their artistic appreciation, the Art Center also regularly holds various art lectures and music and film appreciation sessions. Many well-known artists such as dancer Wu Xiaobang, composer Li Huanzhi, painters Mi Gu and Yan Han, and actors Xiaobai Yushuang and Guo Lanying have been invited to give lectures and have been warmly welcomed by the masses.

In order to review the achievements of mass art, exchange experiences, and discover talents, the Art Center often organizes various types of amateur art festivals with relevant units. For example, the suburban farmers' literary and art festival held every one or two years during the Spring Festival, the workers' literary and art festival held around the festival, and the literary and art festival for university and middle school students held during the summer vacation, etc.

Not Letting Folk Art Treasures Be Lost

Comrades from the folk art research group often take tape recorders to visit folk artists and mass singers. They have visited De Junfeng, Jin Xiaoshan, Han Jieyuan, and others who were well-known ballad singers in Beijing in the late Qing Dynasty and early Republic of China. These artists are now over eighty years old. They are all very happy to record the single-stringed instrument, horse-head tune, and popular ditties that no one has sung for many years, and pass them on to future generations.

The old lady in the photo below, named Zhang Heli, is a member of the Chenguang Agricultural Production Cooperative in Nanyuan District. She is sixty-one years old this year. When she was still a girl, she loved to sing folk ditties. She is quick-witted and quick-eared, and she learns a song after hearing it once or twice. After becoming a daughter-in-law, her feudal mother-in-law forbade her to sing again. After liberation, her heart was bright, and she sang melodious ditties again while working. People then remembered that she used to be a singing person like a lark. Comrades from the folk art research group recorded more than a dozen of her favorite folk songs that she could still remember. This is how the Mass Art Center collects folk art scattered in various places bit by bit.

The widespread development of mass cultural and artistic activities requires a constant supply of literary and artistic materials suitable for mass singing. In order to meet the needs of the masses, the Art Center has run two publications - "Beijing Songs" and "Mass Singing" - through which singing materials are continuously delivered to the masses.

    培植群众艺术的花朵
    ——介绍北京群众艺术馆
    集力
    艺术家和艺术爱好者间的桥梁
    七月八日晚上，中国青年艺术剧院里灯火辉煌。首都的戏剧家和来自一百多个业余戏剧组织的演员们，共同在这里观摩北京业余实验话剧队、石景山钢铁厂业余剧团和中国青年艺术剧院演出的三个独幕剧。这是北京群众艺术馆、中国戏剧家协会和劳动人民文化宫举办的专业和业余剧团的第一次联合演出。幕落下来，座谈会接着就开始。生产战线上的戏剧爱好者和知名的导演、演员在一起，亲切地交换意见，彼此建立了友谊。
    群众艺术馆是专业艺术家和业余艺术爱好者之间的桥梁。它经常组织首都的戏剧家、音乐家、舞蹈家到工厂、农村、学校去，同文艺爱好者们见面，辅导他们的文艺活动。几乎首都所有的专业艺术团体都分别担任了厂矿、农村业余剧团的辅导工作。石景山钢铁厂剧团就是在中国青年艺术剧院和北京电影演员剧团的帮助下成长起来的。北京有工人、大中学生、少年儿童、机关干部、教师等组成的十五个大合唱团，音乐家们在这些业余合唱团里培养着将近三千名群众歌手。
    北京业余艺术团体不仅在首都很活跃，并且和国际上的兄弟业余艺术团体也开始有了联系。
    农民歌手进了国家歌舞团
    群众艺术馆把培养群众业余艺术的骨干作为自己的主要任务之一。这项工作是由业余艺术学校担负起来的。每天傍晚和星期日，有许多厂矿、企业的职工，从各个不同地点赶到业余艺术学校来。有的在听专家们关于各种艺术知识的报告，有的在学作曲和指挥，有的学习新的舞蹈节目，有的对着石膏像聚精会神地在练习素描，有的在排练新戏。他们参加学习，不仅是为了提高自己的艺术知识和技巧，更重要的是要回到本单位去开展文艺活动。六年来，这个学校已培养了九千多名群众文艺活动的积极分子。此外，它还培养了不少具有特别才能的年青的业余艺术家，其中一部分被推荐到专业艺术团体或高等艺术学院学习。
    例如，南苑一带群众所熟知的青年农民歌手东振兴，自小就喜爱唱山歌。解放后，在业余艺术学校的培养下，他的天赋的歌喉得到了发展。他用自己的优美、纯朴、浑厚的歌声，歌唱幸福的生活，歌唱改变了面貌的家乡。不久以前，他成功地通过了中央歌舞团的入学考试，正式被吸收为民间合唱队队员。从此以后，他将得到进一步的深造和专门的培养训练。
    业余艺术学校音乐系的学员、工人作曲者孙振华和王继顺，他们创作的歌曲，在群众中是非常受欢迎的。
    在北京各报刊上经常可以看到张鹤鸣、胡德生、庄平合作的剪纸和漫画。这三位美术爱好者也都在业余艺术学校学习了多年。张鹤鸣是某机关的通讯员，他在繁忙的工作之余，刻苦地从事着美术创作。最近他们正在合作的一幅剪纸，将被送到莱比锡民主德国中央民间艺术馆去作为交换的礼品。第一机床厂工人毛凤德，由于在美术方面有培养前途，已被选送中央美术学院学习。
    夏季音乐舞蹈晚会
    为了丰富首都劳动人民的文化生活，群众艺术馆在每年夏季举办音乐舞蹈晚会，使观众们愉快地度过周末和夏日炎炎的夜晚。在每次晚会上，人们可以首先欣赏各大剧院的最新节目，可以听到雄伟的大合唱，也可以听到富有民族风味的独唱；可以欣赏国外戴誉归来的艺术团的演出、各地的民间舞蹈、绝妙的杂技、幽美的古典乐器演奏、使人捧腹大笑的相声……有些节目是群众平日不易看到的。比如，中国人民解放军军乐团、中央人民广播电台广播乐团、民族管弦乐团、中央新闻纪录电影制片厂乐团等，都在这样的晚会上同观众见了面。
    这个晚会也为业余艺术团体开辟了表演的园地。许多群众的优秀节目，受到观众的欢迎。为了帮助成千上万业余艺术爱好者提高艺术欣赏力，艺术馆还经常举办各种艺术讲座和音乐、电影欣赏会。不少知名的艺术家如舞蹈家吴晓邦、作曲家李焕之、画家米谷、彦涵、演员小白玉霜、郭兰英等都曾被邀请演讲，受到群众极大的欢迎。
    为了检阅群众艺术的成绩，交流经验，发掘人才，艺术馆还常常和有关单位举办各种性质的业余艺术会演。例如，每隔一、二年在春节举办的郊区农民文艺会演，在节日前后举办的职工文艺会演，在暑假里举办的大中学生文艺会演等等。
    不让民间艺术的宝藏失传
    民间艺术研究组的同志们，常常带着录音机去访问民间老艺人和群众歌手。他们访问过清末民初在北京知名的说唱艺人德俊峰、金小山、韩洁远等。这些艺人现已八十多岁了。他们都很高兴将多年没人演唱的单弦、马头调、时调小曲等录音，传留给后人。
    下面照片上的老太太，名字叫张合礼，是南苑区晨光农业生产合作社的社员。她今年已经六十一岁，还在姑娘的时候，就很喜爱唱民间小曲。她心灵耳快，别人唱歌她听一遍两遍就学会了。做了媳妇，封建的婆婆从此就不准她再唱了。解放以后，她的心亮堂了，她一边干活一边又唱起悠扬的小曲来。人们这才记起她当年曾经是个像百灵鸟似的会唱歌的人。民间艺术研究组的同志记录了她还能记得的最喜爱的十几首民歌。群众艺术馆就是这样一点一滴地搜集散布在各处的民间艺术。
    群众文艺活动的广泛展开，要求经常供应适合于群众演唱的文艺材料。艺术馆为了满足群众的这种要求，办了两种刊物——“北京歌声”和“群众演唱”，通过它们把演唱材料源源送到群众手里。（附图片）
