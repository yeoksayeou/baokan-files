    Symphony
    --A Little Talk on Music Appreciation
    Chen Feng
    The capital's cultural circles held a commemorative meeting last night for the 200th anniversary of the birth of Austrian composer Mozart. After the meeting, famous pieces such as Mozart's Symphony No. 40 in G minor and the overture to the opera "The Marriage of Figaro" were performed.
    Mozart wrote many symphonies in his lifetime, among which the Symphony in E-flat major (No. 39), Symphony in G minor (No. 40), and Symphony in C major (No. 41, also known as the Jupiter Symphony) are his representative symphonies.
    "Symphony" refers to a large-scale orchestral piece. If a single orchestral piece is like a one-act play, then a symphony is like a multi-act play.
    Initially (16th century), the term "symphony" was not as strict as it is today. At that time, vocal choruses, preludes, intermezzi, and even short instrumental pieces were all called symphonies. Later, after Italian Neapolitan composer Scarlatti wrote opera overtures consisting of three movements called symphonies, the term "symphony" was definitely used to refer to large-scale instrumental works. Today, Italy still calls opera overtures symphonies.
    By the time of Haydn and Mozart, the organizational form of the symphony became more defined. That is, a large-scale orchestral piece written in the form of a sonata is called a symphony.
    A symphony generally has four movements: the first movement is a fast-paced piece; the second movement is a slow, gentle piece; the third movement is a dance or scherzo; and the fourth movement is a fast-paced piece.
    This arrangement is mainly based on the contrast between musical emotions and beauty. Its arrangement is relatively strict. However, this structure is not completely unchangeable; there are more variations in the second and third movements. For example, the second movement of Mozart's Symphony No. 40 is not a slow and leisurely piece; its third movement is not just a small dance, but already contains elements of a scherzo from the beginning. Later, the tempo of the first and fourth movements of some symphonies also changed. For example, the first movement of Tchaikovsky's "Pathétique Symphony" is slow music, and the fourth movement is slow and gentle music.
    The number of movements in a symphony can be increased or decreased according to the needs of the content. For example, Beethoven's "Pastoral Symphony" consists of five movements: memories of rural life, by the brook, rural scenes, thunderstorms, and the pleasant mood after the thunderstorm.
    More and more Chinese composers are writing symphonies. Xian Xinghai once wrote a "National Liberation Symphony," which includes four movements: Splendid Rivers and Mountains, Historical National Crisis, Defending the Motherland, and Establishing a New Democratic New China. Ma Sicong also wrote a symphony and a symphonic poem "Tibetan Symphonic Poem."
    Although symphonies are relatively complex and large, with more listening, they can still be understood.

    交响曲
    ——音乐欣赏小谈

    首都文化界昨晚举行了奥地利作曲家莫扎特诞生二百周年纪念会。会后，演奏了莫扎特的G小调（第40号）交响曲和歌剧“费加罗的婚礼”序曲等名曲。
    莫扎特一生写了很多首交响曲，其中降E调交响曲（第39号）、G小调交响曲（第40号）和C调交响曲（第41号，又名周彼得交响曲）是他的交响曲代表作。
    “交响曲”或者“交响乐”，是指一种大型的管弦乐曲。如果说，一首单篇的管弦乐曲像独幕剧。那么，交响曲就像一个多幕剧了。
    最初（十六世纪）的交响曲，并不像现在这么严格。那时候，声乐合唱、前奏曲、间奏曲，甚至短短的器乐曲都叫交响曲。后来，意大利拿波里乐派作曲家斯卡拉蒂写的一些三个乐章组成的歌剧序曲叫交响曲以后，才确定地把大型器乐作品称作交响曲。如今，意大利仍然把歌剧序曲叫交响曲。
    到了海顿和莫扎特的时候，交响曲的组织形式就更明确了。那就是参照奏鸣曲的形式写成的大型管弦乐曲才称为交响曲。
    交响曲一般的有四个乐章：第一乐章，快板音乐；第二乐章，慢板、柔美的音乐；第三乐章，舞曲或者谐谑曲；第四乐章，急板音乐。
    这种排列，主要是根据音乐的情感和美的对比而来的。它的安排比较严格。但这种章法并不是完全不变的，其中第二、第三乐章的变换较多。譬如莫札特的第40交响曲的第二乐章，就不是徐缓悠长的音乐；它的第三乐章，也不仅仅是小舞曲，而是开始就带有谐谑曲的成分。到了后来，有的交响曲的第一、第四乐章的速度也有变换了。如柴可夫斯基的“悲怆交响曲”的第一章是徐缓的音乐，第四章是慢板、柔和的音乐。
    交响曲的章数，可以根据内容的需要来增减。像贝多芬的“田园交响曲”就是由乡村生活的回忆、溪边、农村乐景、雷雨、雷雨后的愉快心情等五个乐章组成的。
    我国作曲家写交响曲的也日渐多起来了。冼星海曾经写过一部“民族解放交响曲”。其中包括锦绣山河，历史国难，保卫祖国，建立新民主主义的新中国四个乐章。马思聪也曾写过一部交响曲和一首音诗“西藏音诗”。
    交响曲虽然比较复杂，庞大，但是多听一些，还是能够理解的。
