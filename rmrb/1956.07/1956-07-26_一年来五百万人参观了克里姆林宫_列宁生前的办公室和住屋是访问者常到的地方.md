Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, July 25th: July 20th marked the first anniversary of the Soviet government's decision to open the Moscow Kremlin to satisfy the wishes of the working people. According to the "Pravda" report, about five million people have visited there in the past year, including foreign guests from more than 50 countries.

The famous buildings and cultural relics in the Kremlin have attracted many visitors and won the praise of foreign guests. Among the foreign delegations and tourists visiting the Soviet capital, many people make visiting the Kremlin's architecture and art collections their first priority in Moscow. In the past year alone, more than one million Soviet and foreign visitors have visited the State Armoury.

Lenin's former office and residence in the Kremlin are also frequently visited by visitors. Among them are old Bolsheviks who worked with Lenin, Young Pioneers, cultural and scientific workers, as well as famous foreign political activists and public figures. As can be seen from the visitor's book, Lenin's simple life and working environment have greatly moved many visitors.

In order to allow more Soviet workers who cannot personally visit Moscow to see the Kremlin, Soviet artists specially produced a color documentary film - "Historical Monuments of the Moscow Kremlin", which is now being screened across the Soviet Union. (Attached picture)

People visiting the Kremlin often come to the place where Lenin once worked.

    一年来五百万人参观了克里姆林宫
    列宁生前的办公室和住屋是访问者常到的地方
    新华社莫斯科25日电　七月二十日是苏联政府为满足劳动人民的愿望决定开放莫斯科克里姆林宫的一周年纪念日。据“真理报”报道，一年来到那里参观的已经有五百万人左右，其中包括来自五十多个国家的外国客人。
    克里姆林宫内的著名建筑物和文物古迹吸引了很多的来访者，并且获得了外国客人的赞美。在到苏联首都访问的外国代表团和旅行者当中，有许多人到莫斯科的头一件事就是先去参观克里姆林宫的建筑和艺术珍藏。在最近一年中，单是参观国家兵器陈列库的苏联和外国观众就有一百多万人。
    克里姆林宫里的列宁生前的办公室和住屋也是访问者常到的地方。他们当中有和列宁一同工作过的老布尔什维克，有少年先锋队员和文化科学工作者，也有著名的外国政治活动家和公众领袖。从观众留言薄中可以看出，列宁的朴素的生活和工作环境使许多来访者受到了很大的感动。
    为了使更多的不能亲自到莫斯科来参观的苏联劳动者看到克里姆林宫，苏联艺术工作者特地摄制了一部彩色纪录片——“莫斯科克里姆林宫的历史纪念物”，这部影片现在正在苏联各地上映。（附图片）
    参观克里姆林宫的人们，常到列宁曾经工作过的地方来。
