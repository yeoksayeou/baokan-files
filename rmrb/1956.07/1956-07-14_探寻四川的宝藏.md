    Exploring Sichuan's Treasures

    (Our dispatch) The twelve geophysical prospecting teams active within Sichuan Province have recently discovered more than a dozen locations with potential mineral deposits. Two of these locations have been preliminarily assessed as possibly containing large amounts of iron and several other non-ferrous metals. They have also cooperated with relevant geological departments to confirm a large iron ore deposit in western Sichuan. They are currently working with petroleum exploration departments to search for oil.

    探寻四川的宝藏
    本报讯　活跃在四川境内的十二个地球物理探矿分队，最近又发现了十几个可能蕴藏着矿物的地方，其中有两处已初步判定可能藏有大量的铁和其他几种有色金属。他们还协同有关的地质部门证实了四川西部的一个大铁矿。现在他们正配合石油勘测部门找寻石油。
