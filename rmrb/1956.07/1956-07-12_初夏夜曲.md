Nocturne of Early Summer
    Shu Wu
    Look, this early summer evening on the streets of Beijing, such a bright evening, is truly a beautiful sight. Above is the blue sky, below is the tree-lined road nestled between red walls and green trees. The colorful dresses of the girls flash in the gaps between the rows of green trees. Everywhere is filled with youthful laughter. Everywhere is filled with the almost imperceptible, intoxicating fragrance of locust blossoms. Young mothers lead their apple-cheeked children, walking out from the Palace of Culture for the Working People, to the flower cart filled with bright red peonies, buying a bunch, which the child eagerly snatches. The peonies in chubby little hands, set off by the dense green leaves, appear even more鲜红鲜红, and the fragrance is even more intense.

    Listen, that distant song, sings of "Sacrifice has reached the final moment." Remember? Twenty years ago, you and I, we were singing this song, singing "Swords slashing at the heads of the devils," and also singing that infinitely sad "My home, on the Songhua River in the Northeast," in these songs we began our youthful awakening, began to connect our youth with the destiny of the motherland and the people. Whenever I hear these songs, I completely return to that era. Now, come and take a look at such a living historical painting: this is a painting with storm and flame as the background, with a heroic style, stern and joyful. The contrast of light and dark is so distinct! Their struggle is so fierce! In the center of the painting, the mountains form a solid screen, with ancient pagodas on the mountain tops, rows of cave dwellings on the mountainside, and a red flag with a hammer and sickle fluttering on the roof of a large auditorium. The myriad rays of the sun in the high sky, piercing through the layers of clouds, shine on the flag. That is Yan'an, the red capital familiar to our generation of young people, although many have never been there. Above the painting, countless roads trodden out of the thorns all lead to that center. Our generation of thousands upon thousands of young people, all facing away from the darkness, looked up at that red flag illuminated by the sunlight, and with firm steps, treaded on the land of the motherland, marching in the storm and flames. And in those dark shadows, there lurk all kinds of demons and monsters, poisonous snakes and fierce beasts. Their bared fangs and brandished claws cannot conceal the panic of their doomsday. They want to pounce, but they are always forced back by the sunlight and flames. It can be seen that the corners where they can hide are becoming fewer and fewer.

    You say, it's more important to appreciate the beautiful scenery in front of us, no need to think too much about the past? No, living history will not pass, that heroic, stern and joyful painting is connected with the scene before us. Don't you see in the scene before us the dream that burned in our hearts back then? This blue sky, the tree-lined roads with red walls and green trees, the colorful clothes of the girls flashing in the gaps between the rows of green trees, the youthful laughter, the almost imperceptible, intoxicating fragrance of locust blossoms, the young mother and the apple-cheeked child, the intensely colored and fragrant peonies in the child's hand... didn't they all appear in our dreams back then?

    Moreover, listen, the song is coming again from over there, singing "Let youth be more beautiful." This is the song of contemporary youth, a song praising the spring of today's motherland and people, and also a song about more beautiful dreams of the future. The melody echoing in this song is exactly the same melody in our songs back then. So, why do you still say you can't sing it? No, what contemporary youth can sing is also what we can sing. The spring of today's motherland and people, as well as more beautiful dreams about the future, belong to us as well. Let us catch up and join the ranks of that youthful singing, let's have a grand chorus!

    What's wrong? Why are you so unmotivated? What are you murmuring? "Play, rejoice, grow, young lives!... The future belongs to you!... Although I have sadness, I still have no jealousy..." Oh, this is the dialogue in the famous "Epilogue" of Turgenev's "Home of the Gentry". So, this is what you're thinking about! Friend, this is not good! Turgenev wrote a historical tragedy. At that time, the second generation of Russian revolutionary figures, Chernyshevsky and Dobrolyubov, these commoner intellectual revolutionaries, had already stood up. And Turgenev's youth, the era of the Decembrists and Herzen, the idealistic forties far from the people, had disappeared. Between the previous generation and the next generation, there was an insurmountable gap. The minds of the previous generation still clung to "that magical melody from long, long ago" played by the old piano, while "those young descendants who have left him behind are passing their joyful clamor to his side." To the "young lives" standing before him, the great artist Turgenev said: "The future belongs to you!" But at the same time, the weak liberal Turgenev said this: "I can only bid you a final farewell!" Look, what a terrible tragedy! Isn't "Although I have sadness, I still have no jealousy" only further revealing that despairing melancholy?

    What exactly is the reason that made you think of this?

    In our era, will this tragedy be re-enacted? In our era, the previous generation and the next generation, as long as they always closely link their destinies with the destiny of the people, are all sons of the people; no matter who comes first or who comes last, in front of this great, eternally youthful mother, they are always young compatriots. Their songs harmonize one after another, their joys are interconnected; their dreams will become reality, and the reality they create with their own hands will constantly generate new and great dreams.

    And you, why do you insist on singing that mournful epilogue of Turgenev's? Don't blame me for speaking frankly, there is only one possible reason: you have become somewhat distant from that great, eternally youthful mother. Otherwise, why do you seem so dejected and tired?

    Look, the street lights on East and West Chang'an Avenue are already brightly lit in a straight line, and the pedestrians in front and behind are walking under the bright lights. The radio street broadcast is loudly singing again, still singing "Let youth be more beautiful." Many people are singing along. Mixed with the crisp laughter of the girls, the ringing of the trams, the cries of the children, and the calls of the mothers, it forms a grand symphony praising our eternally youthful era.

    Sing, friend! Use our songs to join this eternally youthful grand symphony!

    初夏夜曲
    舒芜
    你看，这夏天的北京的街头，这样明亮的傍晚，真是一幅美妙的景色。上面是蓝的天空，下面是夹在红墙和绿树当中的林荫道。姑娘们的花衣服，闪现在绿树行列的间隙当中。到处飞扬着年青的欢笑。到处荡漾着槐花的若有若无的醉人的清香。年青的妈妈牵着苹果脸的孩子，从劳动人民文化宫走出来，走到满载着鲜红的芍药的卖花的车子面前，买了一把，被孩子争着拿去了。胖胖的小手中的芍药，在浓密的绿叶的衬托之下，愈见其鲜红，香气也愈见其浓郁了。
    你听，那远处的歌声，唱的是“牺牲已到最后关头”。记得么？二十年前，你和我，就是唱着这个歌，唱着“大刀向鬼子们的头上砍去”，还唱着那无限悲凉的“我的家，在东北松花江上”，在这些歌声中开始我们青春的觉醒，开始把我们的青春同祖国和人民的命运联系起来的。每当听到这些歌声，我就完全回到那个时代去了。现在，你也来看一看这样一个活的历史的画幅吧：这是用风暴和火焰做背景，风格豪壮，严峻而欢乐的画幅。光与暗的对比是这样鲜明！它们的斗争又是这样激烈！画幅的中心，群山结成的坚固的围屏里面，山头有古塔，山上是成排的窑洞，一座大礼堂的屋顶飘扬着一面铁锤和镰刀的红旗，高空的太阳的万道光芒，穿过层云，照射到旗面上。那就是延安，就是我们那一辈青年人人熟悉的红色的都城，虽然许多人从未到过。画幅上面，无数条从荆棘中踏出来的大道，一齐通向那个中心。我们那一辈千千万万的青年，都是背向着黑暗，仰望着那面阳光照耀下的红旗，用坚决的步伐，踏着祖国的大地，在风暴和火焰中行进。而在那些黑暗的阴影里面，藏着各种妖魔鬼怪，毒蛇猛兽。它们的张牙舞爪，掩不住末日的惊惶。它们想扑上来，可又总是被阳光和烈焰逼回去。可以看出，它们能够藏身的角落是愈来愈少了。
    你说，还是欣赏眼前美丽的景色要紧，不必多想过去了的那些事么？不，活的历史是不会过去的，那个豪壮、严峻而欢乐的画幅和眼前的景色正是连成一片的。难道你没有在眼前的景色当中，看出当年燃烧在我们心头的梦么？这蓝色的天空，红墙绿树的林荫道，闪现在绿树行列的间隙当中的姑娘们的花衣，青春的欢笑，槐花的若有若无的醉人的清香，年青的妈妈和苹果脸的孩子，孩子手中浓艳馥郁的芍药花，……不是早就出现在当年我们的梦里面了么？
    而且，听吧，那边又传来了歌声，唱的是“让青春更加美丽”。这是当代青年的歌，是赞美今天祖国和人民的春天的歌，也是关于将来的更美丽的梦的歌。这歌声中回荡着的旋律，正是我们当年那些歌声中的同一个旋律。那么，你为什么还说你不会唱呢？不，当代青年们会唱的，也就是我们会唱的。今天祖国和人民的春天，以及关于将来的更美丽的梦，同样是属于我们的。让我们赶上去，参加到那个青春的歌唱的行列中去，来一个大合唱吧！
    怎么？你为什么这样提不起劲来呢？你口中喃喃地念些什么呢？“玩吧，乐吧，生长罢，年青的生命们！……未来是属于你们的！……我虽然有着悲哀，却仍然并无嫉妒，……”哦，这是屠格涅夫的“贵族之家”的那个有名的“尾声”里面的对话。原来你在想的这个！朋友，这可不太好！屠格涅夫写的是一个历史的悲剧。当时，俄国革命的第二代人物，车尔尼雪夫斯基和杜勃洛留波夫这些平民知识分子的革命家们，已经站了起来。而屠格涅夫的青年时代，十二月党人和赫尔岑的时代，远离人民的理想主义的四十年代，已经消逝。前一辈和后一辈之间，有着不可逾越的鸿沟。前一辈人的心灵，还依恋着旧日的钢琴所弹奏出的“那许久许久以前那神奇的旋律”，而“那些已经把他扔在脑后的少年后辈们正把他们底欢乐的喧声传到他底身畔来”。对于眼前站起来的“年青的生命们”，伟大的艺术家屠格涅夫说：“未来是属于你们的！”而同时，软弱的自由主义者屠格涅夫却是这样说的：“我只有给你们作着最后的诀别！”你看，这是多么可怕的一个悲剧！“虽然有着悲哀，却仍然并无嫉妒”云云，不是只有更加流露出那种绝望的惆怅么？
    究竟是什么原因，使你想起了这个呢？
    在我们的时代，难道还会重演这个悲剧？在我们的时代，前一辈人和后一辈人，只要都把自己的命运同人民的命运始终紧密地联系起来，便都是人民之子；不管谁先谁后，在这位伟大的、青春永驻的母亲面前，总都是年青的同胞兄弟。他们的歌声后先相和，他们的欢乐彼此相通；他们的梦想都会成为现实，他们亲手创造的现实都会不断产生出新的、伟大的梦想。
    而你，为什么偏偏唱起屠格涅夫的那个哀怨的尾声来了呢？莫怪我直说一句，只有一个可能的原因：你已经有些远离了那位伟大的、青春永驻的母亲。要不，你为什么显得这么颓唐疲惫？
    你看，东西长安街的路灯已经一字通明，前前后后的行人都走在明亮的灯光下面。无线电街头广播又大声唱起来，唱的还是“让青春更加美丽”。不少人跟着唱。夹杂着姑娘们清脆的笑声，电车的铃声，孩子们的叫嚷声，妈妈们的呼唤声，形成一曲赞美我们这个青春永驻的时代的大交响乐。
    唱吧，朋友！用我们的歌声，参加这个青春永驻的大交响乐吧！
