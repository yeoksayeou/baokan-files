Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, July 17th: Wuxi textile and filature workers have universally established technical assistance contracts in the advanced producer movement. According to statistics from five large textile factories, including Shenxin, Lixin, Qingfeng, Zhenxin, and Tianyuan, 1,373 pairs of sister, brother, and apprentice contracts have already been signed.

    Workers at the joint state-private Lixin Textile Factory who signed technical assistance contracts teach and learn from each other, drawing on each other's strengths. About 80% have improved their technical skills. The joint state-private Shenxin Textile Factory promoted thirty-three advanced operating experiences through the signing of assistance contracts. Zhang Ruiying, an advanced producer at the joint state-private Zhenxin Textile Factory, signed a sister contract with heddle-drawing workers Wang Quanying and Zuo Qinfang. She often observes their operating methods, promptly points out problems in their operations, and helps them overcome their shortcomings. Wang Quanying and Zuo Qinfang, who had previously failed to meet their quotas and complete their plans, completed their plans in May and June with Zhang Ruiying's help. Zuo Qinfang has already been rated as an advanced producer, and Wang Quanying has also reached the level of an advanced producer.

    Before signing technical assistance contracts, many factories systematically ranked workers' technical levels and organized workers with high technical levels to sign assistance contracts with workers with low technical levels. Some factories organize workers to regularly check the implementation of the contracts and help workers implement technical assistance contracts. Currently, textile and filature factories in Wuxi are using the advanced operating experiences affirmed at the National Textile Industry Advanced Producer Representative Conference as the main content of mutual assistance and are carrying out mass mutual teaching and learning activities.

    Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, July 16th (Reporter Jiang Qingping): Wuxi Local State-Run Filature Factory No. 1 and Joint State-Private Filature Factory No. 5 have signed an assistance contract and have achieved common improvement through mutual help.

    Local State-Run Filature Factory No. 1 is one of the larger and more advanced units in Wuxi's filature industry. It has comprehensively completed the state plan in both last year and the first half of this year. Joint State-Private Filature Factory No. 5 is a newly merged factory. The mutual assistance contract signed by the two factories in May of this year takes improving technical levels, further promoting operational plans to improve enterprise management levels, and strengthening political work as its central content. After the mutual assistance contract was signed, Factory No. 1 helped Factory No. 5 open an advanced experience school and sent technicians and advanced workers to help Factory No. 5's technicians prepare lessons. In two months, the advanced experience school promoted four advanced operating experiences: "Single-Handed Water Surface Refining," "Rapid Cocoon Feeding," "Multi-Grain Cocoon Preparation," and "Calm Water Surface." The number of workers participating in the advanced experience school increased from more than 250 to more than 500.

    At the same time, Factory No. 1 sent four advanced producers to Factory No. 5 to perform operations for a month. Factory No. 5 mobilized and organized eighteen groups to sign contracts with them to teach and learn. These four advanced producers helped workers learn and master advanced operating experiences through explanations, answering difficult questions, demonstration performances of operational decomposition, and on-site guidance. In addition, Factory No. 5 also selected four advanced workers to go to Factory No. 1 to learn advanced operating methods.

    After receiving on-site help and guidance from advanced producers, the technical level of workers at the joint state-private Filature Factory No. 5 has generally improved. Workers who have mastered four advanced operating experiences account for 70% to 90% of the total number of workers in the factory. Last year, not a single worker in this factory fully completed the state plan, but in April this year, 104 people completed the plan, and in May, the number increased to 455, and 104 people won quality awards. In the second quarter, this factory not only comprehensively completed the state plan, but the silk's first-class rate reached 99.5%.

    In the process of implementing the mutual assistance contract, Local State-Run Filature Factory No. 1 also received help from Factory No. 5. Originally, the technical skills of Factory No. 1's silk reeling workers were not as high as those of Factory No. 5. Therefore, Factory No. 5 selected advanced worker Qiu Shidi to go to Factory No. 1 to impart operating experience and help Factory No. 1 improve its silk reeling technology.

    Now, the two factories are studying and signing a mutual assistance contract for the third quarter in order to achieve further common improvement based on the principle of learning from each other's strengths.

    无锡市纺织缫丝工人
    普遍订立技术互助合同
    两个缫丝厂取长补短共同提高
    新华社南京17日电　无锡市纺织缫丝工人在先进生产者运动中，普遍订立了技术互助合同。据申新、丽新、庆丰、振新和天元等五个大型纺织厂统计，已经订立了1，373对姊妹、兄弟、师徒合同。
    公私合营丽新纺织厂签订技术互助合同的工人，互教互学、取长补短，有80％左右提高了技术水平。公私合营申新纺织厂通过签订互助合同推广了三十三项先进操作经验。公私合营振新纺织厂先进生产者章瑞英和穿棕工人王泉英、左琴芳签订了姊妹合同。她经常观察这两个人的操作方法，及时指出操作上存在的问题，帮助她们克服缺点。一向达不到定额，完不成计划的王泉英和左琴芳经章瑞英的帮助，五、六月份都完成了计划。左琴芳已经被评为先进生产者，王泉英也达到先进生产者水平。
    许多工厂在订立技术互助合同以前，都有计划地对工人的技术水平进行排队，组织技术水平高的工人和技术水平低的工人订立互助合同。有的工厂组织工人定期检查合同执行情况，帮助工人实现技术互助合同。目前，无锡市各纺织缫丝厂正以全国纺织工业先进生产者代表会议上肯定的先进操作经验作为互助的主要内容，开展群众性的互教互学活动。
    据新华社南京16日电　新华社记者蒋青萍报道：无锡市地方国营缫丝第一厂和公私合营缫丝第五厂订了互助合同，相互帮助取得了共同提高的效果。
    地方国营缫丝第一厂是无锡市缫丝工业中规模较大、生产比较先进的单位之一，去年和今年上半年，都全面完成了国家计划。公私合营缫丝第五厂是新合营的工厂。这两个厂今年五月份订立的互助合同，以提高技术水平、进一步推行作业计划提高企业管理水平、加强政治工作等三个方面作为中心内容。互助合同订立后，第一厂帮助第五厂开办先进经验学校，并且选派技术人员和先进工人帮助第五厂的技术人员备课。先进经验学校在两个月中推广了“单手水面精理”、“快速进茧”、“多粒备茧”、“水面平静”等四项先进操作经验。参加先进经验学校的工人由二百五十多人增加到五百多人。
    在这同时，第一厂又派了四个先进生产者，到第五厂作了一个月的操作表演。第五厂发动和组织了十八个小组同他们订立包教包学合同。这四个先进生产者通过讲解、解答疑难问题、操作法分解示范表演和实地指导等方式，帮助工人学习和掌握了先进操作经验。此外，第五厂还选派四个先进工人到第一厂去学习先进操作法。
    公私合营缫丝第五厂的工人经过先进生产者的实地帮助和指导以后，技术水平普遍提高。掌握四项先进操作经验的工人占全厂工人总数的70％到90％。去年一年，这个厂没有一个工人全面完成国家计划，可是今年四月完成计划的有104人，五月份增加到455人，并且有104人获得了优胜质量奖。第二季度，这个厂不仅全面完成了国家计划，并且丝的正品率达到了99.5％。
    在执行互助合同的过程当中，地方国营缫丝第一厂也得到了第五厂的帮助。原来第一厂的编丝工人的技术不如第五厂的高。于是第五厂选派了先进工人丘士娣到第一厂去传授操作经验，帮助第一厂提高了编丝技术。
    现在，这两个厂正在研究签订第三季度的互助合同，以便根据取长补短的原则，达到进一步共同提高的目的。
