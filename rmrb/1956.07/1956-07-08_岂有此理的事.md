    What an Outrageous Thing!
    The vast majority of primary school teachers in Jiangzhen District, Huaining County, Anhui Province, only received half a month's salary in June this year. The reason for this, it is said, is that some schools did not complete the task of collecting tuition fees on time, and the county education section had to deduct it from the teachers' salaries.
    Teachers' salaries are the compensation for their teaching work. This is a different matter from students not paying tuition fees on time. How can teachers' labor remuneration be deprived to compensate for the shortfall in students' unpaid tuition fees? This is truly an outrageous thing. (Liu Pushan)

    岂有此理的事
    安徽省怀宁县江镇区绝大多数的小学教师，今年六月份只领到了半个月的工资。所以如此，据说是有些学校没有按期完成收缴学费的任务，县教育科不得不在数师的工资中扣除。
    教师的工资，是他们进行教学工作的劳动报酬。这和学生没有及时缴纳学费是两回事，怎么能剥夺教师的劳动报酬来补偿学生欠缴学费的缺额呢？这真是一件岂有此理的事。　　　（刘璞山）
