The State Council's Directive on Developing Pig Farming

    Raising pigs on a large scale is a measure of decisive significance for increasing fertilizer production and improving crop yields. In 1955, Song Changsheng Agricultural Cooperative in Yanggu County, Shandong Province, harvested 860 jin of corn per mu because of large-scale pig raising and the application of 14,000 jin of fertilizer per mu. However, on land with the same soil conditions, applying 100 jin of soybean cake and 40 jin of chemical fertilizer per mu only produced 450 jin of corn. In 1955, Han Jiawa Agricultural Cooperative in Ding County, Hebei Province, raised more than 1,600 pigs, applying 12,000 jin of fertilizer per mu, and increased the per-mu grain yield from 479 jin in 1954 to 520 jin. Furthermore, due to the sufficient supply of fertilizer, 92% of the land was planted twice a year. These examples powerfully illustrate the significant effect of raising pigs and accumulating manure on increasing agricultural production. However, at present, the total number of pigs in the country can only fertilize over 300 million mu if each pig fertilizes 3 mu, which is only equivalent to one-fifth of the country's cultivated land. Moreover, judging from the situation of fertilizer source excavation in various places this year, if pig farming is not rapidly and massively developed, fertilizer supply will encounter great difficulties in the next few years. At the same time, in order to guarantee the urgent needs of urban and rural meat supply and export trade, it is also necessary to actively develop the pig farming industry. After the State Council issued a directive on developing pig farming last winter, the number of pigs in various places has increased. However, since the beginning of spring, some areas have seen a downward trend in the number of pigs because agricultural production cooperatives have not paid attention to arranging pig raising for their members' families, have not properly solved the various new problems that have arisen in pig raising by members' families after cooperativization, lack experience in collective pig raising by cooperatives, lack feed, and have pig purchase prices that are somewhat low, and have seen more pig diseases than in previous years. This is not in line with the requirements of national economic development. For this reason, the following instructions are now given again:
    (1) Pig raising has always been an important household sideline for farmers in our country. After agricultural cooperativization, it is still an important household sideline for members of cooperatives. Actively organizing members' families to raise more pigs, "private ownership, private raising, and public assistance" is the main method for developing pig raising at present. Because members' families have many favorable conditions for raising pigs, not only can the original pig-raising equipment and experience be utilized, but the feed and labor required for decentralized pig raising are also relatively easy to solve. Neglecting to organize pig raising by members' families will reduce the personal income of members, which is also detrimental to the development of cooperatives. Agricultural departments and agricultural production cooperatives at all levels must do their best to help members' families solve the various difficulties they encounter in pig raising. Agricultural production cooperatives should, in accordance with the state's plan for developing pig raising, raise boars and sows, breed piglets, and supply members' families with the needs for raising fattening pigs. Cooperatives should uniformly organize the prevention of pig diseases and control pig diseases. The manure accumulated by members' families must be purchased in a timely manner according to quality and price to ensure the reasonable income of members' families from accumulating fertilizer. When cooperatives set the purchase price of manure, they should compare it with the level of remuneration for other labor and should not make the labor income from accumulating fertilizer too low. Some cooperatives have set the price for purchasing manure accumulated by members' families too low, which affects the enthusiasm of members to raise pigs, and this should be promptly and appropriately adjusted. Cooperatives should not control the working hours of members too strictly and should take into account the labor time required by members' families for raising pigs and accumulating manure. Currently, some members' families lack pig feed, and cooperatives should actively assist in solving this problem.
    Agricultural production cooperatives that have started collective pig raising must do a good job in the operation and management of pig farms, designate special personnel to be responsible, formulate feeding and management systems, and stipulate reasonable labor quotas and labor remuneration for pig-raising personnel to develop the collective livestock industry of the cooperative. Some of the newly established cooperatives, due to lack of feed and equipment and poor experience, are not raising publicly owned pigs well and can also adopt the method of "contracting labor, dividing fertilizer and lard" and entrusting members' families to raise pigs in a decentralized manner.
    (2) On the basis of increased grain production, the problem of concentrated feed for pigs should be effectively solved. In the unified purchase and sale of grain, sufficient necessary concentrated feed should be reserved according to the existing number of pigs and the planned number of pigs that are actually planned to be developed. When agricultural production cooperatives distribute agricultural products, they should also take into account the feed needs of members' families for raising pigs and make appropriate adjustments; and they should appropriately distribute "leftover grain" to members and not only take into account the needs of publicly owned livestock and disregard the needs of members for raising pigs. Currently, many areas have insufficient concentrated feed for pigs, and the provincial grain departments should quickly allocate a portion of grain as pig feed and supply it to members and agricultural production cooperatives. If the provincial grain sales target is insufficient, it can be reported to the Ministry of Food for solutions. By-products from grain and agricultural product processing by local grain and supply and marketing cooperatives, such as bran, cakes, etc., must be quickly transferred. In the future, all kinds of cakes, except for a small portion that can be used as fertilizer in economic crop areas, should all be used as livestock feed in other areas to develop livestock and use animal manure to fertilize fields. At the same time, when arranging grain sales, all localities should allocate a certain amount of grain to appropriately restore sideline production such as tofu workshops and flour mills in rural areas to increase pig feed.
    At the same time, we must further vigorously open up feed sources. Cooperatives should organize manpower to widely collect wild green feed, in addition to meeting current needs, and store it in silage or dry it for storage. Water hyacinth cultivated in the southern regions generally produces more than 200,000 jin per mu of pond per year, which can solve the entire green feed needs of 100 pigs. Places with conditions should strive to promote it. In order to achieve self-sufficiency in feed, cooperatives should calculate the total feed needs of the entire cooperative based on the development plan for publicly owned pigs and pig raising by members' families, and then comprehensively arrange the quantity of agricultural and sideline products that can be used as feed and the sources of wild feed that can be collected. And plan to allocate the necessary land to plant juicy feed that pigs like to eat, such as melons, sweet potatoes, etc.
    (3) In some areas, the difference between the purchase price of live pigs and the selling price of pork is large, the purchase price of live pigs is low, and the standard for converting live pigs to meat is high, resulting in no profit or even loss for farmers raising pigs. This is not conducive to the development of live pigs and should be quickly adjusted. At the same time, when farmers are engaged in individual operations, they do not calculate labor remuneration for many sideline products; but after agricultural cooperativization, the situation has changed, and the level of labor remuneration has become the standard for agricultural production cooperatives and members to choose this or that sideline. This change cannot but be reflected in the purchase price of live pigs. Therefore, the commercial departments are ordered to conduct thorough investigations of the pig-raising costs in various places in conjunction with the agricultural departments, conduct comprehensive research, and propose a reasonable price plan for the purchase of live pigs and a reasonable standard for converting live pigs to meat, and report it to the State Council for approval and implementation; and implement the method of prepaying deposits and pre-purchasing live pigs to stimulate the enthusiasm of the masses for raising pigs. Many areas with inconvenient transportation have favorable conditions for developing pig raising, but because no one purchases them, the pig-raising industry cannot be developed, or there is a phenomenon of unsold fat pigs. The commercial departments should actively find ways to strengthen purchases, organize on-site processing, and then transfer them to supply meat-deficient areas. At the same time, in areas along transportation routes and areas with large live pig purchase tasks, when commercial and supply and marketing cooperative departments purchase live pigs, they must make overall arrangements for the meat supply problems of farmers in these areas and stipulate a method of selling a certain number of jin of pork and lard to farmers for each pig purchased to avoid farmers complaining that they cannot eat meat after feeding pigs, which affects the enthusiasm for raising pigs.
    (4) Strengthen the prevention and control of pig epidemics. At present, the prevalence of pig epidemics is quite serious, which poses a great threat to the development of pig raising. Especially after agricultural cooperatives collectively raise pigs, pig diseases are more likely to be transmitted. Therefore, agricultural departments at all levels are ordered to effectively help cooperatives do a good job in preventing and controlling pig diseases, establish a health and epidemic prevention system, and train epidemic prevention personnel for cooperatives. For areas where swine fever often occurs, veterinarians and biological drugs must be supplied in a timely manner for large-scale preventive injections. In areas where epidemics have occurred, agricultural departments, commercial departments, supply and marketing cooperative departments, and health departments should closely cooperate to effectively isolate, blockade, disinfect, and properly dispose of corpses of sick pigs to control the spread of epidemics.
    (5) In order to meet the needs of fertilizer and meat, it is required that by 1957, each household in the agricultural areas of North China and Northwest China raise an average of one to one and a half pigs, each household in the provinces of the Yangtze River Basin raise an average of one and a half to two pigs, and each household in the southern and northeastern provinces and suburban areas of large cities raise an average of two to two and a half pigs. Each province and county should formulate specific plans and measures for their province and county to achieve this requirement based on local specific conditions. This task is very arduous, but it is also possible to complete. It is required that the People's Committees of each province and county earnestly recognize that developing pig raising is an important key to whether agriculture can increase production in the next few years and be responsible for organizing and leading agriculture, commerce, grain and other relevant departments to actively strive to achieve this requirement.

    国务院关于发展养猪的指示
    大量养猪，对增产肥料、提高农作物产量是一项具有决定意义的措施。山东省阳谷县宋长生农业合作社1955年由于大量养猪，每亩施肥一万四千斤，收获玉米八百六十斤，而同样土质条件的土地，每亩施豆饼一百斤、化学肥料四十斤，仅生产玉米四百五十斤。河北省定县韩家洼农业合作社1955年养猪一千六百多只，每亩施肥一万二千斤，每亩粮食产量从1954年的四百七十九斤提高到五百二十斤，并且由于肥料的充分供应，使92％的土地一年种了两季。这种例子，有力地说明了养猪积肥对于农业增产的显著效果。但是，目前全国所有的猪，按每口肥田三亩计算，肥田不过三万万多亩，只等于全国耕地的五分之一。而且从今年各地挖掘肥源的情况看来，如果不迅速地大量地发展养猪，在最近几年之内，肥料的供应将遇到极大的困难。同时，为保证城乡肉食供应和出口贸易的迫切需要，也必须积极发展养猪业。去年冬季国务院发出关于发展养猪的指示以后，各地猪的头数已有增长。但是入春以来，部分地区因为农业生产合作社对于社员家庭养猪没有注意安排，对于合作化后社员家庭养猪所发生的种种新问题没有很好的解决，对于合作社集体养猪又缺乏经验，加以饲料不足，有些地区猪的收购价格偏低，猪病较往年为多，以致猪的数量又有下降趋势。这同国民经济发展的要求是不相适应的。为此，现在再作如下的指示：
    （一）养猪历来是我国农民的一项重要的家庭副业，农业合作化以后，仍然是合作社社员的一项重要的家庭副业。积极组织社员家庭多养猪，“私有、私养、公助”是当前发展养猪的主要办法。因为社员家庭养猪有很多便利条件，不仅原有的养猪设备和经验可以发挥利用，而且分散养猪所需要的饲料和劳力也比较容易解决。忽视组织社员家庭养猪，将减少社员的个人收入，对于合作社的发展也是不利的。各级农业部门和农业生产合作社，必须尽力帮助社员家庭解决养猪所遇到的各种困难。农业生产合作社应该按照国家发展养猪的计划，饲养种公猪和母猪，繁殖仔猪，供应社员家庭养育肥猪的需要。合作社应该统一组织猪病的预防工作，防治猪病。对于社员家庭所积的粪肥，必须按质论价，及时收购，保证社员家庭积肥的合理收益。合作社规定粪肥收购价格的时候，应该同其他劳动所得报酬的高低比较一下，不要使积肥的劳动所得过低。有些合作社收购社员家庭所积的粪肥作价过低，影响社员养猪的积极性，应当迅速地加以适当调整。合作社对于社员的劳动时间不应控制太死，应该照顾到社员家庭养猪积肥所需要的劳动时间。当前有些社员家庭缺乏养猪饲料，合作社应该积极协助解决。
    已经开始集体养猪的农业生产合作社，必须做好养猪场的经营管理工作，指定专人负责，制定饲养管理制度，规定养猪人员的合理的劳动定额和劳动报酬，把合作社公有的畜牧业发展起来。其中有些新建社，由于缺乏饲料和设备，经验又差，公有猪养的不好，也可以采取“包工分、包肥膘”的办法，委托社员家庭分散饲养。
    （二）应该在粮食增产的基础上，切实解决猪的精饲料。在粮食统购统销中，应该按现有猪的头数和确实计划发展的猪的头数，留够必要的精饲料。农业生产合作社分配农产品的时候，也应该照顾到社员家庭养猪的饲料需要，做适当的调剂；并且应该把“下脚粮”适当分配给社员，不能只顾公有牲畜的需要，而不顾社员养猪的需要。当前不少地区猪的精饲料不足，省的粮食部门应该迅速下拨一部分粮食作为猪的饲料，供应给社员和农业生产合作社。省的粮食销售指标如果不足，可以报请粮食部设法解决。各地粮食和供销合作部门农产品加工的副产物，如糠麸，饼类等，必须迅速下调。各种饼类，今后除经济作物区可以用少部分作肥料以外，其他地区应该全部作为牲畜饲料，发展牲畜，以畜粪肥田。同时，各地在安排粮食销售的时候，应该拨出一定数量的粮食，适当恢复农村中的豆腐坊、粉坊等副业生产，以增加猪的饲料。
    同时，要进一步大力开辟饲料来源。合作社应该组织人力，广泛搜集野生的青绿饲料，除供当前的需要以外，并且把它青贮或者干藏起来。南方地区栽培的水浮莲，一亩池塘一般年产二十多万斤，可解决一百多口猪的全部青绿饲料，有条件的地方应该努力推广。为了作到饲料的自给自足，合作社应该根据公有猪和社员家庭养猪的发展计划，算出全社饲料的需要量，再根据全社可以用作饲料的农副产品的数量和可能搜集的野生饲料的来源，全面地加以安排，并且有计划地拿出必要的土地种植猪所喜爱吃的多汁饲料，如瓜类、薯类等。
    （三）有些地区生猪收购价格与猪肉销售价格相差较大，生猪收购价格偏低，毛猪折肉标准偏高，致农民养猪无利，甚至亏本。这是不利于发展生猪的，应该迅速加以调整。同时，农民在个体经营的时候，对于许多副业产品是不计算劳动报酬的；而在农业合作化以后，情况发生了变化，劳动报酬的高低已成为农业生产合作社和社员选择这种副业或那种副业的标准了。这种变化也不能不反映到生猪收购价格上面来。因此，责成商业部门会同农业部门切实调查各地的养猪成本，通盘加以研究，提出生猪收购的合理的价格方案和毛猪折肉的合理标准，报国务院批准实行；并且实行预付定金、预购生猪的办法，以激发群众养猪的积极性。许多交通不很方便的地区是有发展养猪的有利条件的，但是由于无人收购，养猪事业发展不起来，或者存在着肥猪滞销的现象，商业部门应该积极设法加强收购，组织就地加工，而后调出供应缺肉地区。同时，在交通沿线和生猪收购任务较大的地区，商业和供销合作部门收购生猪的时候，必须对于这些地区的农民的肉食供应问题加以统筹安排，规定出收购一头猪卖给农民以若干斤猪肉和猪油的办法，以免农民抱怨喂了猪吃不上肉，致影响养猪的积极性。
    （四）加强猪的疫病防治工作。目前猪的疫病流行相当严重，对发展养猪威胁很大，特别是农业合作社集体养猪以后，猪病更易传染。因此，责成各级农业部门切实帮助合作社做好猪病的防治工作，建立卫生防疫制度，为合作社训练防疫员。对于常发生猪瘟的地区，必须及时供应兽医和生物药品，大量进行预防注射。在已发生疫病的地区，农业部门、商业部门、供销合作部门和卫生部门应该密切配合，切实做好病猪的隔离、封锁、消毒以及合理处理尸体等工作，控制疫病蔓延。
    （五）为适应肥料和肉食的需要，要求到1957年，华北和西北的农业地区每户平均养猪一头至一头半，长江流域各省每户平均养猪一头半至二头，南方和东北各省以及大城市郊区平均每户养猪二头至二头半。各省各县应该根据当地的具体条件，定出本省本县实现这个要求的具体的计划和措施。这个任务是十分艰巨的，但是也是可能完成的。要求各省、县人民委员会切实认清发展养猪是最近几年农业能否增产的一个重要关键，负责组织和领导农业、商业、粮食等有关部门，为实现这个要求而积极努力。
    国务院总理　周恩来
                  1956年7月1日
