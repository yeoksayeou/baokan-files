A Veteran's Plea

When Will Temporary Work End?

I am a demobilized soldier who was assigned to work in Anxi County, Fujian Province, in February 1955. I served in the army for seven or eight years, and there were five of us who were demobilized together. Each of us has technical expertise. For example, both Lin Jiacai and I can independently handle navigation operations and repairs. When we were first demobilized, we all hoped to dedicate our skills to the socialist construction of our motherland, but our legitimate aspirations have not been met. Four of us were assigned to the supply and marketing cooperative, one to the printing factory, and another to the tea company. This misallocation of talents has caused us great distress.

What particularly distresses us is that we have been working for more than a year and are still temporary workers. We don't understand what qualifications are required to become a formal employee? When can we be transferred to become formal employees? We heard that comrades who were demobilized with us have already become formal employees in other places, but why have we, who were assigned to Anxi, received completely different treatment?

    复员军人的呼声
    临时工，何时了？
    我是1955年2月间分配到福建省安溪县参加工作的复员建设军人。过去在部队里服务了七、八年，和我一起复员的还有五个人，我们每个人都有技术专长。譬如我和林家财，都能够单独担任航行操作和修理工作。我们开始复员的时候，每人都期望着能够把自己的技术献给祖国的社会主义建设事业，可是我们的正当愿望并没有得到满足。我们之中，四个人被分配到供销合作社，一个人在印刷厂，另一个人在茶叶公司。用非所长，使我们非常苦恼。
    特别使我们苦恼的，是我们参加工作一年多了，都还是临时性人员。我们不懂，正式工作人员到底要具备什么条件？干到什么时候才能转成正式工作人员？听说和我们一起复员的同志，在其他地方早已是正式工作人员了，可是分配到安溪的我们为什么却受到了完全不同的待遇？　李树敏
