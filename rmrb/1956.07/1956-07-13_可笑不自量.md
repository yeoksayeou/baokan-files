Title: Ridiculous Overestimation of One's Abilities

Recently, U.S. Vice President Nixon made a so-called whirlwind visit to Asia and delivered many pleasant speeches. In a speech in the Philippines, he said, "We believe that every country has the right to formulate its own policies, and we respect any decisions it makes." He also said that the United States is willing to provide assistance to other countries when they need it, without asking for anything in return. It seems that Nixon wanted to give the impression that the United States was beginning to treat Asian countries with respect and friendship.

However, Nixon immediately exposed himself. In several speeches embellished with beautiful words, he wantonly slandered the Soviet Union and China, maliciously attacked countries that pursue a neutral policy, and insulted those countries willing to accept economic assistance from the Soviet Union and China. He said that India's neutral policy is a "huge danger" and that neutralism is harmful to "freedom." He said that accepting economic assistance from the Soviet Union and China is taking the risk of "having a rope put around one's neck." In short, the vast majority of Asian countries became the target of Nixon's attacks; this U.S. Vice President was simply deliberately going to the doorsteps of Asian countries to curse.

Not long ago, U.S. Secretary of State Dulles shouted that neutralism was "immoral"; now Nixon has come to repeat this argument. Why are they so irreconcilably hostile to neutralism?

Indian Prime Minister Nehru recently said very rightly: "Neutralism merely means adopting an independent policy." In recent years, many Asian countries have pursued a neutral policy, refusing to participate in the military blocs planned by the United States, insisting on peaceful coexistence with all countries, and opposing colonialism. Therefore, for Asian countries, pursuing a neutral policy means upholding peace and opposing war, it means adhering to independence and opposing enslavement. Facts have proven that any country, whether large or small, as long as it pursues this independent policy, can contribute to peace in Asia and the world, can win the attention and respect of other countries in international affairs, and can obtain sympathy and support in all aspects of the struggle to maintain and consolidate independence. This is precisely the reason why Dulles and Nixon and their ilk repeatedly attack neutralism with resentment. It is clear that the United States opposes neutralism, which means opposing Asian peace and insisting on creating tensions in Asia; it means opposing the independence and autonomy of Asian countries and insisting on colonial aggression.

However, the trend of neutralism cannot be stopped by any evil force. With the relaxation of the international situation and the failure of the U.S. policy of strength, the influence of neutralism is growing. Now, even in some Asian countries participating in U.S. military blocs, neutralist sentiments are constantly growing. Nixon's trip to Asia, in addition to Taiwan and South Vietnam, also included activities in the Philippines, Thailand, Pakistan, and Turkey, apparently in an attempt to stop the growth of neutralist influence in order to make up for the widening cracks appearing within the U.S. military bloc. Nixon's attacks and slanders against neutralism and China and the Soviet Union were to a large extent an attempt to intimidate and threaten the countries he visited, and to sow discord between them and other Asian countries.

This is particularly evident in the US attitude towards Pakistan. On the eve of Nixon's visit to Pakistan, United Press reporter Robert Brown reported, by no means accidentally, that "U.S. officials are concerned about Pakistan's new enthusiasm for being friendly with the Communists. … They feel it is getting along too well with Communist China, and they fear this may frighten Washington into cutting back on much-needed U.S. aid to Pakistan." This is what Nixon calls the United States' "respect" for any decisions made by Asian countries! This is what Nixon calls the United States being willing to "help" other countries unconditionally! And Nixon specifically chose Karachi as the venue for his speech attacking Nehru, apparently in an attempt to stir up trouble and further provoke relations between India and Pakistan so that the United States could profit from it.

However, Nixon's attempt to create a cold war whirlwind in Asia with his visit is completely futile. More and more Asian countries, in order to safeguard peace and independence and to develop their own economies, advocate pursuing a policy of peace and independence and promoting friendly cooperation between countries around the world, especially among Asian countries. This is the reality of Asia. This is also an irresistible historical trend in Asia. Nixon's whirlwind visit cannot affect the development of the Asian situation, just as an ant cannot shake a big tree; doing so only makes people feel that these guys are "ridiculously overestimating their abilities."

    可笑不自量
    最近，美国副总统尼克松到亚洲作了一次所谓旋风式的访问，并且讲了许多动听的话。他在菲律宾的一次演讲中说：“我们相信每个国家有拟订自己的方针的权利，我们尊重它作出的任何决定。”他又说，美国愿意在别的国家需要帮助的时候给予帮助，而不要求这些国家的任何东西。看来尼克松想要给人一种印象，仿佛美国开始用尊重和友好的态度来对待亚洲国家了。
    但是，尼克松马上就自己揭穿了自己。他在点缀着漂亮词句的几次演说中，放肆地诬蔑苏联和中国，恶意地攻击实行中立政策的国家，并且侮辱那些愿意接受苏联和中国经济援助的国家。他说，印度的中立政策是一个“巨大的危险”，中立主义是对“自由”有害的。他说，接受苏联和中国的经济援助就是冒“脖子上被套上绳子”的危险。总之，亚洲的绝大部分国家都成了尼克松的攻击对象，这位美国副总统简直是故意找上亚洲国家的门口骂街来了。
    不久以前，美国国务卿杜勒斯曾经大喊中立主义是“不道德的”；现在尼克松又来重复这种论调。他们究竟为了什么要同中立主义结下这样不共戴天的仇恨呢？
    印度总理尼赫鲁最近说得非常对：“中立主义仅仅意味着采取一种独立的政策”。近年来，亚洲许多国家实行中立政策，拒绝参加美国所策划的军事集团，坚持同所有国家和平共处，反对殖民主义。所以，对于亚洲国家来说，奉行中立政策，就是拥护和平，反对战争，就是坚持独立，反对奴役。事实证明，任何国家，不管它是大国还是小国，只要奉行这种独立的政策，它就能对亚洲和世界的和平作出贡献，就能在国际事务中赢得其他国家的重视和尊敬，就能在维护和巩固独立的斗争中取得各方面的同情和支持。杜勒斯和尼克松之流所以要一再悻悻地攻击中立主义，其原因也就在这里。很明显，美国反对中立主义，就是反对亚洲和平，坚持在亚洲制造紧张局势，就是反对亚洲国家的独立自主，坚持殖民侵略。
    但是，中立主义的潮流不是任何恶势力所能遏止得住的。随着国际局势的缓和，和美国实力政策的失败，中立主义的影响正在日益扩大。现在甚至在参加美国军事集团的一些亚洲国家里，中立主义的情绪也正在不断滋长。尼克松这次亚洲之行，除了到台湾和南越这两个地区以外，还到菲律宾、泰国、巴基斯坦和土耳其等国进行活动，显然是企图阻止中立主义影响的增长，以弥补在美国军事集团内部出现的日益扩大的裂缝。尼克松对中立主义和中国、苏联的攻击和诬蔑，在很大的程度上是企图对他所访问的国家进行恫吓和威胁，并且挑拨它们同其他亚洲国家之间的关系。
    这一点，在美国对巴基斯坦的态度上表现得特别明显。在尼克松访问巴基斯坦前夕，合众社记者罗伯特·布朗绝非偶然地报道说：“美国官员们对巴基斯坦希望同共产党人友好的新的热情感到忧虑。……他们感到它同共产党中国搞得过分好，他们担心这可能使华盛顿害怕而削减巴基斯坦极为需要的美援。”这就是尼克松所说的美国“尊重”亚洲国家作出的任何决定！这就是尼克松所说的美国愿意无条件地“帮助”别的国家！而尼克松特地选择喀喇蚩作为他发表攻击尼赫鲁的谈话的场所，显然企图播弄是非，进一步挑拨印度和巴基斯坦之间的关系，使美国得以从中取利。
    但是，尼克松想用他的访问在亚洲造成一股冷战的旋风，这完全是徒劳的。越来越多的亚洲国家为了维护和平和独立，为了发展自己的经济，主张实行和平独立政策，并促进世界各国之间、特别是亚洲各国之间的友好合作。这是亚洲的现实。这也是亚洲的一种不可抗拒的历史趋势。尼克松的旋风访问不能影响亚洲局势的发展，正同蚍蜉不能撼动大树一样；这样做，只能使人感觉这些家伙“可笑不自量”。
