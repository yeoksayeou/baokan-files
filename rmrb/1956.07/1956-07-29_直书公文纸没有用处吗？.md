    Are Vertically Written Official Documents Useless?
    Since newspapers and periodicals have switched to horizontal writing, various government departments have also begun using horizontally formatted official paper, which is certainly a good practice. However, some units have stored away many of their original vertically written, column-formatted official papers without utilizing them. I believe this practice is clearly wasteful.

    直书公文纸没有用处吗？
    自从报纸和刊物改为横排以后，各机关单位也陆续使用了横书公文用纸，这种做法当然是好的。可是有些单位却把原有的很多直书竖格公文用纸存放起来，不加利用，这种作法，我认为显然是浪费。
