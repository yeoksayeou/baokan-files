Xinhua News Agency, July 28th. The Central Committee of the Jiusan Society held two symposiums on the 15th and 27th to discuss the Chinese Communist Party's guiding principle of long-term coexistence and mutual supervision with democratic parties.

Zhou Peiyuan said at the meeting that the principle put forward by the Chinese Communist Party is an honor for the democratic parties and strengthens their responsibilities. He believes that if the democratic parties are to exist for a long time, they must do more work. Li Yi, Deputy Secretary-General of the Central Committee of the Jiusan Society, said in his speech that in order to further develop and consolidate the democratic parties, their members should feel that joining the democratic parties is helpful. As far as the Jiusan Society is concerned, it is to help members in terms of political thought and in marching towards science. He also announced at the meeting that the number of members of the Jiusan Society has now increased nearly twenty times compared with the time of liberation.

Regarding the issue of mutual supervision between the Chinese Communist Party and the democratic parties, Wang Zhixiang believes that consultation between the Chinese Communist Party and the democratic parties on state affairs is a form of mutual supervision. Inspections of work by people's representatives and CPPCC members are also a form of supervision. Yin Zanxun believes that the Chinese Communist Party has not supervised the democratic parties enough in the past and has been too polite; in the future, the democratic parties must also speak frankly and exhaustively to the Chinese Communist Party. Chu Anping said that the purpose of mutual supervision is to improve work. How can supervision be more effective? Should a system be used to guarantee it? He hopes that relevant parties will conduct further research on these issues.

    九三学社中央委员会
    座谈互相监督长期共存方针
    新华社28日讯　九三学社中央委员会在十五日和二十七日举行了两次座谈会，讨论中国共产党和民主党派长期共存、互相监督的方针。
    周培源在会上说，中国共产党提出的这一方针，对民主党派是一种荣誉，同时也加强了民主党派的责任。他认为民主党派要长期存在，就要更多地进行工作。九三学社中央委员会副秘书长李毅在发言中谈到，民主党派要进一步发展和巩固，应该使它的成员感到参加民主党派后有所帮助。就九三学社来说，就是要使社员在政治思想上、在向科学进军等问题上有所帮助。他在会上还宣布说，九三学社的成员现在比解放时已经增加了近二十倍。
    关于中国共产党和各民主党派互相监督的问题，王之相认为，中国共产党和民主党派就国家事务进行协商，就是互相监督的一种方式。人民代表和政协委员视察工作也是一种监督。尹赞勋认为中国共产党过去对民主党派监督得不够，过于客气；民主党派今后对中国共产党也要做到知无不言、言无不尽。储安平说，互相监督的目的是为了改进工作。怎样来进行监督会更有效果？是否要用制度来保证？他希望有关方面对这些问题作进一步的研究。
