Large numbers of minority farmers and herdsmen across the country have joined the Chinese Communist Party.

In the rural areas of the Liangshan Yi Autonomous Prefecture and the Ganzi Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture in Sichuan Province, the first groups of Yi and Tibetan Party members have emerged this year. On the grasslands of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, where there was not a single herdsman Party member four years ago, more than 200 CCP branches have now been established, with more than 2,800 herdsman Party members. Scattered in the rural areas of the Guixi Zhuang Autonomous Prefecture in Guangxi Province, there are already more than 67,000 Party members of various ethnic groups, and the vast majority of townships there have Party branches. Yunnan Province and Guizhou Province each have more than 30,000 minority Party members, and the number of minority Party members in Qinghai Province has increased to more than 4,000. In Gansu Province, all fifteen minority ethnic groups have a certain number of Party members, totaling more than 16,000.

Party organizations in various regions attach great importance to the training of minority cadres. Yunnan Province has already selected more than 1,700 leading minority cadres at or above the level of CCP district committee secretary. At the recent Party congresses of various counties, more than 370 Party members of nearly 20 ethnic groups in the province were elected as CCP county committee secretaries, deputy secretaries, and county committee members. The Kawa and Miao ethnic groups now have their first CCP county committee deputy secretaries from their own ethnic groups. In the past two years, Party organizations in Qinghai Province have also promoted more than 400 minority leading cadres at or above the district level. (According to Xinhua News Agency)

    少数民族农民牧民大批入党
    全国各地少数民族农民牧民大批加入中国共产党。
    在四川省凉山彝族自治州和甘孜藏族自治州的农村，今年出现了第一批彝族和藏族党员。四年前还没有一个牧民党员的内蒙古自治区草原上，现在已经建立二百多个中共支部，有二千八百多名牧民党员了。散布在广西省桂西僮族自治州农村的各族党员，已经有六万七千多人，那里绝大多数的乡都有了党支部。云南省和贵州省各有三万多名少数民族党员，青海省的少数民族党员，已经增加到四千多人；甘肃省的十五种少数民族，都有了一定数量的党员，共一万六千多人。
    各地党的组织很重视对少数民族干部的培养。云南省已经选拔了一千七百多个中共区委书记以上的少数民族领导干部。在不久以前分别举行的各县党代表大会上，这个省有近二十种民族成份的三百七十多个党员当选为中共县委书记、副书记和县委委员，佧瓦族、苗族从此都有了本民族的第一个中共县委副书记。青海省党的组织在近两年来，也提拔了区级以上少数民族领导干部四百多人。（据新华社讯）
