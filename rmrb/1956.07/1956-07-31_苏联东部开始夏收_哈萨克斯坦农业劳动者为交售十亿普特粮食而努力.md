(Dispatch from our newspaper in Moscow on the 30th) Summer harvest has begun in the eastern Soviet Union.

In Kazakhstan, Siberia, and the Urals, the boundless sea of grain waves in the wind, and local agricultural workers and reinforcements from other regions have begun a period of intense harvesting. This year, unlike previous years, Kazakhstan's harvest holds a pivotal position in the entire Soviet Union. As a result of adding 18 million hectares of new land, agricultural workers in Kazakhstan are guaranteeing to harvest 1.4 billion poods of grain this year, and guaranteeing to deliver one billion poods of grain to the state. Everyone in the Soviet Union is encouraged by this news. Not long ago, Kazakhstan was considered a backward region in terms of grain production. Previously, collective farms and state farms in this republic could only deliver tens of millions of poods of grain to the state, but this year they can deliver one billion poods. Therefore, in terms of grain production, Kazakhstan has now become the second largest granary in the Soviet Union, second only to the Russian Federation, surpassing the long-famous Ukraine. Agricultural workers in Kazakhstan are now striving to harvest the grain in a timely and undamaged manner. The Karaganda Oblast, which handed over 25 million poods of grain to the state, is now guaranteeing to overfulfill its quota by 6 million poods. The Third Production Team of the Molotov State Farm in the Kokchetav Oblast estimates that it can harvest 150 poods of grain per hectare of land.

The latest news from the Krasnoyarsk Krai in Siberia says that the first batch of grain has been harvested. The collective farms and machine tractor stations in the Shushenskoye District were the first to begin harvesting. Combine operator Trepeshko of the Lenin Collective Farm and the Krupskaya Collective Farm harvested 50 hectares of grain. Now, agricultural workers in Siberia and Kazakhstan are competing with each other, with the condition of delivering one billion poods of grain to the state.

Grain has ripened in the Ural region: rye grows as tall as a person, and wheat grows tall and dense. The Lenin Collective Farm in the Sverdlovsk Oblast has begun harvesting using a two-stage harvesting method. The chairman of this collective farm, Polevnov, said that we will harvest in shifts around the clock.

    苏联东部开始夏收
    哈萨克斯坦农业劳动者为交售十亿普特粮食而努力
    本报莫斯科30日电　苏联东部收割开始了。
    在哈萨克斯坦、西伯利亚和乌拉尔，一望无际的谷物海洋在随风起伏，当地农业劳动者和外地来的援军开始了紧张的收割。今年和往年不同，哈萨克斯坦的收成在全苏联占着举足轻重的地位。由于增加了一千八百万公顷新地的结果，哈萨克斯坦的农业劳动者保证在今年收割十四亿普特的粮食，保证上缴给国家十亿普特粮食。全苏联谁不为这个消息而鼓舞。不久前，哈萨克斯坦在谷物生产方面还被认为是落后地区，以前这个共和国的集体农庄和国营农场只能交给国家几千万普特粮食，而今年可以上缴国家十亿普特粮食。因此，从粮食产量来说，哈萨克斯坦今天已一跃而成为仅次于俄罗斯联邦的苏联第二大谷仓，赶在久已闻名的乌克兰前面去了。哈萨克斯坦农业劳动者现在努力争取及时不受损耗地收割粮食。卡拉干达州交给国家二千五百万普特粮食，现在保证超额缴给国家六百万普特粮食。柯克齐塔夫州莫洛托夫国营农场第三生产队估计在每公顷土地上可收一百五十普特粮食。
    从西伯利亚克拉斯诺雅尔斯克边疆区传来的最新消息说，第一批粮食已经收割下来了，最先开始收割的是舒辛区的集体农庄和机器拖拉机站；以列宁和克鲁普斯卡娅命名的集体农庄的收割机手特列佩斯科收割了五十公顷的粮食。现在西伯利亚和哈萨克斯坦的农业劳动者彼此竞赛，条件是要交给国家十亿普特粮食。
    乌拉尔地区的谷物成熟了：黑麦长得有人那么高，麦子长得又高又密。斯维德洛夫斯克州的列宁集体农庄用分段收割方法开始收割。这个农庄的主席波列夫诺夫说，我们将昼夜不停地轮班收割。
