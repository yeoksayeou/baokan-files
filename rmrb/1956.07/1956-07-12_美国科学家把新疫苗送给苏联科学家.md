Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, July 11th: Dr. Sabin, an academician of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences, who is currently visiting the Soviet Union, has given a new vaccine he invented for the prevention of polio to Soviet scientists.

In a conversation, Dr. Sabin said that scientists from the United States and the Soviet Union will be able to work together for the happiness of all mankind.

The Sabin vaccine is different from the Salk vaccine in the United States. The Sabin vaccine can be taken with food at the same time. As little as one drop of live virus culture in a teaspoon of sweet fruit juice is enough to increase the necessary immunity to polio in children's bodies. One liter of such vaccine is enough to immunize 100,000 children. However, the Salk vaccine cannot completely solve the problem of preventing polio. The preparation of the Salk vaccine requires a very difficult technical process. Its production is very complex and difficult to mass-produce.

Dr. Sabin attended the All-Union Congress of Health and Medical Scientists in Leningrad a few days ago, and it was in Leningrad that he gave his vaccine to Soviet scientists. He will give two lectures to Soviet physicians in Moscow.

    美国科学家把新疫苗送给苏联科学家
    新华社莫斯科11日电　现在苏联访问的美国国立科学院院士塞宾博士，把他发明的一种预防小儿麻痹症的新疫苗赠给了苏联科学家。
    塞宾博士在一次谈话中说，美苏两国的科学家将能够为全人类幸福而共同工作。
    塞宾疫苗同美国的索尔克疫苗不同。塞宾疫苗可以和食品同时服用。在一茶匙甜果汁中只要含有一滴生毒培养物，就能够在孩子们的机体中增进对小儿麻痹症的必要免疫能力。一公升这样的疫苗，足够供十万儿童免疫用。而索尔克疫苗还不能完全解决预防小儿麻痹症的问题。配制索尔克疫苗要经过非常困难的技术过程。它的生产非常复杂，很难大量生产。
    塞宾博士前几天在列宁格勒参加了全苏卫生和医学家的代表大会，他就是在列宁格勒把他的疫苗交给苏联科学家的。他将在莫斯科给苏联医师们作两次讲演。
