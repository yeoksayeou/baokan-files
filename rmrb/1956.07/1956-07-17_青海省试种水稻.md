Xinhua News Agency, Xining, 14th: This year, the Qinghai Provincial Agricultural Comprehensive Experiment Station has experimentally planted rice in Xining, Ledu, and the Golmud Farm in the Qaidam Basin. The 1.2 mu of rice experimentally planted in the Gaomiao Township Agricultural Production Cooperative in Ledu County is growing best. In the past few days, the plants have grown to over a foot tall, which has aroused the interest of many farmers. The rice experimentally planted on land 2,231 meters above sea level in the suburbs of Xining City had grown to 8.5 inches by the 13th. The Golmud Farm, located more than 2,800 meters above sea level, has slower rice growth, only 3 inches high by the end of June.

According to the person in charge of the Qinghai Provincial Agricultural Comprehensive Experiment Station, Qinghai Province has never grown rice before. According to the instructions of the leading organs of Qinghai Province, the experiment station will, through experimental planting in the next two years, solve the problem of whether rice can be grown on a large scale in Qinghai Province.

    青海省试种水稻
    新华社西宁14日电　青海省农业综合试验站今年在西宁、乐都和柴达木盆地的格尔穆农场试种了水稻。在乐都县高庙乡农业生产合作社试种的一亩二分水稻长得最好，这几天已株高一尺多，引起了许多农民的兴趣。在西宁市郊区拔海二千二百三十一公尺的土地上试种的水稻，十三日已长到八寸五分。格尔穆农场地处拔海二千八百公尺以上，水稻生长比较慢，六月底只有三寸高。
    据青海省农业综合试验站负责人说，青海省从来没有种过水稻，按照青海省领导机关的指示，试验站要在今明两年经过试种，解决青海省能否大量种植水稻的问题。
