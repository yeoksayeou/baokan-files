    Prime Minister Nehru Reiterates That the Unification of Korea Should Not Be Postponed Indefinitely

    Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, July 29th. Prime Minister Nehru and Minister Without Portfolio Krishna Menon reiterated on July 27th that India believes the steps to reunify Korea should not be postponed indefinitely.

    Answering questions from members of the People's Assembly, Nehru reviewed the development of the Korean situation since March of this year. In March of this year, the United Nations Command requested the withdrawal of the armistice inspection personnel from Poland and Czechoslovakia (the northern headquarters considered this unilateral action illegal and a violation of the armistice agreement). Therefore, the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission has temporarily withdrawn its inspection teams stationed at designated ports in North and South Korea. It was pointed out that this withdrawal is temporary and does not change the legal status of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission unless both parties to the Armistice Committee reach a common agreement.

    Answering questions, Krishna Menon said that the issue of reunifying Korea is raised at the United Nations every year, but it has been shelved. The situation is that the United Nations Command and all the countries that support it believe that Korean elections should be conducted under the supervision of the United Nations. It appears that countries like India have agreed to international supervision that is different from United Nations supervision. However, no progress has been made, but the Indian government has emphasized that the unification of Korea should not be postponed indefinitely.

### 尼赫鲁总理再一次指出  朝鲜的统一不应当无限期拖延

    尼赫鲁总理再一次指出
    朝鲜的统一不应当无限期拖延
    据新华社新德里29日电　尼赫鲁总理和不管部长克里希纳·梅农七月二十七日重申印度认为重新统一朝鲜的步骤不应当无限期拖延的主张。
    尼赫鲁在人民院回答议员质询的时候追述了今年三月以来朝鲜事态的发展。今年三月，联合国军司令部要求波兰和捷克斯洛伐克的停战视察人员撤退（北部的司令部认为这个片面行动是非法的和违反停战协定的），因此，中立国监察委员会已经暂时撤退了驻在北朝鲜和南朝鲜指定口岸的视察小组。据指出，这次撤退是暂时的，并不改变中立国监察委员会的合法地位，除非停战委员会双方达成共同协议。
    克里希纳·梅农在回答质询的时候说，重新统一朝鲜的问题每年都提到联合国去，但是都被搁置起来了。情况是，联合国军司令部和支持它的所有国家都认为，朝鲜的选举应该在联合国的监督下进行，看来，像印度等国家已经同意了和联合国监督有区别的国际监督。然而目前没有取得任何进展，但是印度政府已经着重指出，朝鲜的统一不应当无限期拖延。
