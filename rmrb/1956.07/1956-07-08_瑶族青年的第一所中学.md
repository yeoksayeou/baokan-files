Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, July 7th: In the mountains of southern Hunan Province, the first Jianghua Yao Autonomous County National Middle School, which primarily trains Yao cadres, is under construction. This national middle school will begin enrolling new students this autumn.

Before liberation, it was rare for Yao youths to attend middle school. After liberation, the Party and the People's Government actively helped the Yao people develop cultural and educational undertakings. However, because Yao farmers live in high mountains and villages are hundreds of miles apart, it is still very inconvenient for their children to attend school. After the completion of this national middle school, the first batch of new students enrolled this autumn will include 110 Yao youths, eight times more than the existing number of Yao middle school students.

    瑶族青年的第一所中学
    新华社长沙7日电　在湖南省南部的丛山峻岭里，第一所以培养瑶族干部为主的江华瑶族自治县民族中学正在兴建中。这所民族中学在今年秋季就要开始招收新生。
    瑶族青年上中学，在解放前是罕见的。解放后，党和人民政府积极帮助瑶族发展文化教育事业，但由于瑶族农民居住在高山峻岭中，村寨相距百数十里，子弟入学还是很不方便。这所民族中学建成后，今年秋季招收的第一批新生中，将有110名是瑶族青年，比现有瑶族中学生增加八倍。
