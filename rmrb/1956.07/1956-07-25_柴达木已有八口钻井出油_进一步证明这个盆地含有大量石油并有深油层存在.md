Xinhua News Agency, Xining, July 24th (Xinhua News Agency reporter Peng Xue) As of mid-July, eight wells in the Qaidam Basin, Qinghai Province, have gushed or flowed crude oil during the drilling process; some wells gushed as high as dozens of meters. Chemical analysis has proven that the quality of the crude oil from each well is very good. In addition, five other wells have shown varying degrees of oil and gas. According to experienced geologists, these well oil gushings and oil and gas displays further prove that the Qaidam Basin contains abundant oil and has deep oil layers, with very high oil layer pressure, capable of self-flowing.

Oil exploration in the Qaidam Basin began in 1954. Over the past two years, geological exploration personnel have found nearly a hundred oil-bearing structures with large areas and good closure in the basin, and have discovered many outcrops of ozokerite, asphalt, and oil sand, among other oil shows; some oil shows on the structures have outcrops as long as two kilometers.

This year, larger-scale oil exploration work has been carried out in the Qaidam Basin. Workers, geological exploration workers, young people, and university graduates from all over the country are pouring into the basin to directly participate in and support oil exploration work in the basin. Among them, the number of geological exploration personnel has increased two and a half times compared to last year. Currently, dozens of deep, medium, and shallow drilling rigs are conducting drilling operations on more than a dozen structures, and the roar of the drilling rigs is breaking the silence of the valleys and deserts.

    柴达木已有八口钻井出油
    进一步证明这个盆地含有大量石油并有深油层存在
    新华社西宁24日电　新华社记者彭雪报道：截至七月中旬为止，青海省柴达木盆地已经有八口钻井在钻进过程中喷出或流出原油；有的井喷高达几十公尺。经过化验证明，各井原油的质量都很好。另外还有五口钻井，也有过不同程度的油气显示。据有经验的地质人员谈：这些钻井的喷油和油气显示，进一步证明了柴达木盆地含有大量石油，并且有深油层存在，油层压力很大，能够自喷。
    柴达木盆地的石油勘探工作，是从1954年开始的。两年以来，地质勘探人员已经在盆地寻找到了近百个面积大、闭合好的储油构造，并且发现了多处地腊、沥青和油沙等油苗显示；有的构造上的油苗，露头长达两公里。
    今年，在柴达木盆地进行了更大规模的石油勘探工作。全国各地的工人、地质勘探工作者、青年和高等学校毕业生源源地进入盆地，直接参加和支援盆地的石油勘探工作。其中地质勘探人员就比去年增加了两倍半。现在有几十部深钻、中钻和浅钻钻机正在十多个构造上分别进行钻探，钻机的轰鸣声打破了静寂的山谷和戈壁。
