299 Projects Under Construction

    (Our newspaper, Nanjing) Jiangsu Province plans to build and expand 299 state-owned, locally state-owned, and joint state-private industrial enterprises this year, and these projects are now starting construction one after another.

    Among the newly built factories, the state-owned Nanjing Phosphate Fertilizer Plant is a relatively large factory designed by our own Chinese technical personnel with the help of Soviet experts, based on Soviet data. Currently, the main structures No. 1 and No. 2 of this factory have already begun pouring concrete, and main structure No. 4 has also started construction. The production capacity of expanded enterprises will generally be greatly improved. After the expansion of the Jinping Phosphate Mine on the bank of the Yellow River, the annual output will increase dozens of times compared to now. The two newly built pumping stations in Huaibei Salt Field alone can increase the production of crude salt by more than 3.73 million dan for the country each year. After the expansion of the Wuxi Diesel Engine Factory, the production capacity will increase five times compared to the past, and it can become a factory specializing in the production of amphibious diesel engines.

 　 299项工程在建设
    本报南京讯　江苏省今年计划新建和扩建299个国营、地方国营和公私合营工业企业，现在这些工程正在陆续开工。
    新建工厂中，国营南京磷肥厂是我国技术人员根据苏联资料，在苏联专家帮助下自己设计的一个较大的工厂。现在，这座工厂的一、二号主厂房已经在浇灌混凝土，四号主厂房也已经开始施工。扩建的企业，生产能力一般都将大为提高。黄河边的锦屏磷矿扩建以后，年产量将比现在增加几十倍，淮北盐场仅新建的两个扬水站，每年就可以为国家增产原盐373万多担。无锡柴油机厂扩建以后，生产能力将比过去提高五倍，而且可以成为一个专业生产水陆两用柴油机的工厂。
