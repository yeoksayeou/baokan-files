    A Tense Badminton Match
    The last of the five badminton matches held at the Beijing Gymnasium last night was the most exciting. Our athletes Wang Wenjiao and Chen Fushou launched a high-speed attack on Olie and Li Baocan at the beginning of the match, and the opponents also returned with high-speed attacks. Each point scored by either side required several or more than a dozen fierce smashes or gentle drop shots. Every movement of the athletes held the audience's heartstrings, and the audience only remembered to applaud and cheer after a point was won or lost. In the first game, Olie and Li Baocan were completely passive under the lightning-like attack and lost to Wang Wenjiao and Chen Fushou by eight to fifteen. In the second game, Wang Wenjiao and Chen Fushou still had a strong fighting spirit, but they made more unforced errors, so the opponents were ahead in the first eight points. Later, they used accurate and fierce smashes to disrupt the opponent's formation, and won the second game by fifteen to nine. Olie told reporters yesterday that the Chinese athletes hit the ball extremely fast and were the most difficult opponents he had ever encountered. Dian Yi

    一场紧张的羽毛球赛
    昨晚在北京体育馆举行的五场羽毛球赛，以最后一场最为精采。我国运动员王文教和陈福寿在比赛一开始，就对奥利和李宝灿展开高速度进攻，对方也以高速还击。双方每得一分都要经过几次或十几次的猛力抽杀或轻轻吊球。运动员的每个动作都扣住观众的心弦，直到一球见了胜负观众才想起鼓掌和叫好。第一局奥利和李宝灿被闪电式的进攻压得完全处于被动地位，以八比十五输给王文教和陈福寿。第二局王文教和陈福寿的斗志仍很强，但是接球自杀较多，所以在前八个球对方一直占先，后来他们又用准确而猛烈抽杀，打乱了对方的阵角，又以十五比九赢了第二局。昨天奥利对记者说，中国运动员击球速度极快，是他所遇见的对手中最辣手的。　甸义
