    Giving Small Items When Big Ones Are Needed
    Our factory recently accepted a batch of processing tasks, rolling 8 cm round steel for Tangshan Tangda Machine Factory, a total of 70 tons. The raw materials sent to us by Tangda Machine Factory were very good 19 cm round steel. The workers in our factory saw it and said, "What a pity! Good steel has to be ruined." At the same time, our factory received another task, rolling 19 cm round steel for the Hebei Provincial Party School, a total of 400 kilograms. This requires, on the one hand, destroying 19 cm round steel to roll it into 8 cm round steel, and on the other hand, using good raw materials to roll 19 cm round steel, which is a serious waste. Later, we contacted the above two units and handed over a part of the 19 cm round steel sent by Tangda Machine Factory to the Hebei Provincial Party School for use as finished products. In addition, we had to destroy a part of the 19 cm round steel to convert it into 8 cm round steel for Tangda Machine Factory. We believe that this reflects the shortcomings of relevant departments in the material allocation work, namely, giving small items when big ones are needed, and hope that attention will be paid to avoid this in the future.

    要小给大
    我们厂最近接受一批加工任务，给唐山唐大机器厂轧制八糎元钢，共七十吨。唐大机器厂给我们发来的原料，是很好的十九糎元钢，我厂工人看了都说：“真可惜！好好的钢得毁掉”。在这同时，我厂又接到了一个任务，给河北省党校轧制十九糎元钢，共四百公斤。这就需要一方面毁掉十九糎元钢轧成八糎元钢，一方面又得用好原料轧十九糎元钢，真是严重的浪费。后来，我们和以上两个单位联系，把唐大机器厂发来的一部分十九糎元钢交给河北省党校作成品用，另外还得毁掉一部分十九糎元钢给唐大机器厂改八糎元钢。我们认为这反映了有关部门在材料调拨工作上存在着要小给大的缺点，希望今后注意避免。
