    Okinawa People Express Determination
    Not One Inch of Land Will Be Sold to the US
    Association to Protect Okinawa Land Established in Naha
    Xinhua News Agency, Naha: The Association to Protect Okinawa Land was established in Naha, the capital of Okinawa Island, on July 18. This organization was reorganized from the Association to Promote Solutions to Military Land Issues, which was jointly formed by twenty social groups.
    The conference unanimously resolved to implement the four principles of "Not selling one inch of land to the US," and "Opposing lump-sum payment for military land rent," and to expose to the world the false propaganda that attempts to undermine these principles, and to resist oppression and fight to the end together with all the residents of the prefecture.
    On the same day, the association jointly formed by five institutions, including the Ryukyu Government, the Legislature, and the Mayor's Joint Organization, also decided to request that the US High Commissioner of the Ryukyus, Lannizle, and representatives of the Japanese government come to Okinawa Island to hold tripartite talks with local representatives. This association decided that if the tripartite talks cannot meet the demands and hopes of the residents, then the initially decided total resignation should be resolutely implemented.

    冲绳人民表示决心
    一坪土地也不卖给美国
    保卫冲绳土地协议会在那霸成立
    据新华社讯　那霸消息：保卫冲绳土地协议会七月十八日在冲绳岛首府那霸成立。这个组织是由二十个社会团体联合组成的促进解决军用土地问题协议会改组而成的。
    大会一致决议，要贯彻“一坪土地也不卖给美国”、“反对一次付清军用土地租金”等四项原则，并且要和全县居民一道向全世界揭发阴谋破坏这些原则的虚伪宣传，反抗压迫，斗争到底。
    同一天，琉球政府、立法院、市长联合组织等五个机构联合组成的协议会也决定，要求美国琉球总督兰尼兹尔和日本政府的代表到冲绳岛来，和当地代表举行三方会谈。这个协议会决定，如果三方会谈不能满足居民的要求和希望，就应当坚决实行最初所决定的总辞职。（附图片）
