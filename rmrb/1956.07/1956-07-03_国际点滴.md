    Increasing Number of Drunkards in Britain
    According to the British "Medical Journal," the number of drunkards in Britain is increasing. In England and Wales, there are more than 250,000 alcoholics. In 1954, 1,150 people died from cirrhosis of the liver due to drinking, compared to only 800 in 1948.

    New American Method for Quitting Smoking
    It is estimated that today, at least 100,000 people in the United States are addicted to heroin. Some people go to rehabilitation centers to ask doctors for treatment to quit their addiction. The doctors give them a drug called "Lucian." After three weeks, when they are discharged from the hospital, the patients are as energetic as before they were addicted. However, before long, the patient's bad habits reappear, so they go back to the rehabilitation center for treatment, and the doctors give them "Lucian" again. As a result, the same situation reappears, and the condition gets worse. It turns out that the so-called "Lucian" is just a modified form of heroin.

    New Application of "Diplomatic Immunity"
    An American female employee of the U.S. Embassy in Thailand, Nama Jackson, owed a year's worth of rent and telephone bills in Bangkok. The amount owed was nearly one thousand U.S. dollars. When the landlord was about to sue her, Miss Jackson actually claimed that she enjoyed "diplomatic immunity."

    英国纵酒人数增加
    据英国“医学杂志”说：英国纵酒的人数正在增加。在英格兰和威尔斯，嗜酒成瘾的有二十五万人以上。1954年，由于饮酒肝脏变硬而死的有一千一百五十人，而在1948年仅八百人。
      美国的戒烟新法
    据估计，今天美国吸食海洛英的人至少超过十万人。有些人为了戒瘾到戒毒所去请求医生治疗，医生就给他一些叫做“路西安”的药，这样三星期后出院时，病人精神奕然，和未吸毒之前一样。可是过不多久，病人的恶习又出现了，于是再去戒毒所治疗，医生还是给他一些“路西安”，结果同样的情形又出现了，病情越来越坏。原来所谓“路西安”者不过是海洛英的改制品。

    美国驻泰国大使馆的一个女职员娜玛·杰尔逊在曼谷欠了一年的房租和电话费不付。这笔欠款数目将近一千元美金。当房主要控告她的时候，这位杰尔逊小姐竟说她是享有“外交豁免权”的。
