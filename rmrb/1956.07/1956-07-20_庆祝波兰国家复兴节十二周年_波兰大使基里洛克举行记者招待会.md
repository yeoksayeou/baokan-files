Xinhua News Agency, July 19th - Polish Ambassador to China, Kiryluk, stated at a press conference held in Beijing today that the Polish people have begun to build a backward agricultural-industrial country before the war into an independent and prosperous nation with modern chemical industry and agriculture.

This press conference was held to celebrate the twelfth anniversary of Poland's National Rebirth Day on July 22nd. At the conference, Ambassador Kiryluk introduced the great achievements made by the Polish people in their construction endeavors to Chinese journalists.

Kiryluk said that in 1955, Poland's industrial production had increased fivefold compared to before the war, and many industries that did not exist before the war had been established.

He said that Poland is now able to manufacture various types of steel, isotopes for industrial use, ocean-going ships, automobiles, tractors, and heavy machine tools, and has established giant chemical plants and other factories. The number of employed people in Poland has tripled compared to before the war.

He said that the increase in industrial output has changed the nature of Poland's exports. Before the war, Poland exported agricultural products and raw materials. Today, Poland has a great potential to export more industrial products. Trade between Poland and other countries is increasing year by year. The total trade volume between China and Poland in 1955 increased by 82.1% compared to 1950.

Kiryluk pointed out that although there are these achievements, there are still serious shortcomings, namely that light industry and agriculture lag behind heavy industry. Due to this unbalanced development, the living standards of the Polish working people have not improved as planned.

He said that Poland has now begun to implement a new five-year plan. With the development of industry, Poland will strive to improve the living standards of the working people. Agricultural output will increase by 22% to 25% during the five-year plan period, and the production of consumer goods will also increase significantly.

Ambassador Kiryluk and embassy officials also answered questions raised by reporters.

More than sixty reporters from various Chinese newspapers and magazines attended today's reception.

    庆祝波兰国家复兴节十二周年
    波兰大使基里洛克举行记者招待会
    新华社19日讯　波兰驻中国大使基里洛克今天在北京举行的一次记者招待会上说，波兰人民已开始把战前的一个落后的农业工业国建设成为一个拥有近代化工农业的、独立富强的国家。
    这个记者招待会，是为了庆祝七月二十二日波兰国家复兴节十二周年而举行的。会上，基里洛克大使向中国记者介绍了波兰人民在建设事业中所取得的伟大成就。
    基里洛克说，1955年同战前相比，波兰的工业生产量已增加为五倍，创设了许多种战前所没有过的工业。
    他说，波兰现在已能制造各种钢、工业上需用的同位素、海洋轮船、汽车、拖拉机和重型机床，建立了巨型化学工厂和其他工厂。波兰就业人数同战前相比增加为三倍。
    他说，工业产量的增加，改变了波兰出口的性质。战前波兰是出口农产品和原料，今天的波兰有着出口更多工业品的巨大可能性。波兰同各国间的贸易正在逐年增加，波中两国的贸易总额，1955年比1950年增加了82.1％。
    基里洛克指出：虽然有这些成就，但仍有严重的缺点，这就是轻工业与农业落在重工业的后面。由于这种发展不平衡的原因，所以波兰劳动人民的生活水平，没有像原订计划那样提高。
    他说，现在波兰已开始执行新的五年计划，随着工业的发展，波兰将努力提高劳动人民的生活水平。农业产量在五年计划期间将增加22％到25％，消费品的生产量也将大大增加。
    基里洛克大使和使馆官员还分别回答了记者们所提出的问题。
    参加今天招待会的，有中国各报刊杂志的记者六十多人。
