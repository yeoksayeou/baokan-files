Xinhua News Agency, Tanjiazhuang, 3rd - Xinhua News Agency reporter Wang Jian reports: On the Baoji-Chengdu Railway, track-laying and bridge-building workers moving south are today braving heavy rain to erect the Huoyazi Bridge, the second bridge north of the junction point, over the turbulent Jialing River. The construction workers on the northern section have once again overcome the threat of floods in the Jialing River basin, allowing the track-laying project, which was halted for eight days, to continue towards the junction point from July 1st. Now, the construction workers need to lay only six more kilometers of track before the north and south sections are joined.

This year, the rainy season came a month earlier than last year. In June, the upper reaches of the Jialing River were mostly shrouded in continuous rain, adding many difficulties to the track-laying project. Construction workers laid only a little over seventeen kilometers of track during this month. From June 20th, due to five consecutive days of heavy rain in the upper reaches of the Jialing River, mountain torrents washed down many unremedied problem slopes along the northern section, damaging the line. Dozens of trains loaded with steel rails and bridge sections did not have time to be transported to the track-laying front according to the emergency plan and were stranded in sections at various stations along the line. The track-laying and bridge-building project had to be halted. At this time, the workers fought against the difficulties. The entrance to the tunnel closest to the track-laying front was blocked by more than 80,000 cubic meters of isolated rocks and stones washed down by the flood. Six cubic-meter shoveling youth assault teams, working in shifts for four days and nights, threw the mountain of stones into the Jialing River. On some slopes beside the line, thin mud was flowing; the workers couldn't use shovels effectively, so they removed it handful by handful. In Lijahe, when the permanent water barrier dam was not yet completed, a flash flood suddenly struck, and a section of the roadbed was breached. The workers braved the rain to dismantle the section of steel rails, built a temporary line next to it, and transported 4,000 grass sacks filled with rubble from Shuangshipu overnight to build a flood-prevention embankment to prevent the flood from further damaging the roadbed. Until the afternoon of June 30th, the drizzle was still intermittent, and collapsing earth and rocks were still occasionally blocking the transportation line, but the workers cleared them away at any time, and transportation was not hindered. The engineering train today transported steel rails and bridge sections to the track-laying front again.

The mountains on both sides of the Jialing River are still shrouded in heavy clouds and mist, the rain is getting heavier and heavier, and the employees along the line are preparing to fight the flood that will strike again.

### 宝成路北段大雨滂沱  铺轨架桥工人奋勇同洪水搏斗

    宝成路北段大雨滂沱
    铺轨架桥工人奋勇同洪水搏斗
    新华社谈家庄3日电　新华社记者汪坚报道：宝成铁路上向南前进的铺轨架桥工人们，今天冒着大雨，在浊浪翻腾的嘉陵江上架设接轨点以北的第二座桥梁——火崖子大桥。北段的筑路工人又一次战胜了嘉陵江流域的洪水威胁，使停止了八天的铺轨工程在七月一日起继续向接轨点前进。现在，筑路工人再铺轨六公里多，南北两段便接轨了。
    今年雨季比去年早来一个月。六月份，嘉陵江上游多半时间处在阴雨连绵的日子里，给铺轨工程增加了许多困难。筑路工人在这个月里只铺轨十七公里多。六月二十日起，因为嘉陵江上游一连五天的滂沱大雨，山洪把北段沿线许多处没有根治完的病害山坡冲刷下来，毁坏了线路，几十辆装满钢轨和桥梁的列车没有来得及按紧急计划运到铺轨前方，都分段停留在沿线各个车站上，铺轨架桥工程不得不停顿下来。在这时候，工人们同困难展开了斗争。距铺轨前线最近的一处隧道口，被八万多方冲刷下来的孤石和石块堵住了。六个铲方的青年突击队，经过四昼夜的轮番铲运，把堆得像小山一样的石头抛到了嘉陵江中。线路旁有些边坡上流着稀泥浆，工人们用铲子使不上劲，就用双手一捧一捧地把它清除掉。在李家河，当永久性的挡水坝还未完工的时候，洪水猛然袭来，路基给冲破了一段缺口，工人们就冒雨拆除了这段钢轨，在旁边修起一条便线，并且把从双石铺连夜运来的四千只草袋，装满片石，垒筑一道防洪堤岸，防止洪水再冲路基。直到六月三十日下午，细雨还是时断时续的下着，坍落的土石方还在不时地挡着运输线，但经工人们随时扫除，运输未受阻碍。工程列车今天又把钢轨和桥梁运送到铺轨前方。
    嘉陵江两岸的群山还是笼罩在重重云雾里面，雨愈下愈大，沿线的职工正在准备和再一次袭来的洪水搏斗。
