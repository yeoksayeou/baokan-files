Fuzhou, July 13th (by our reporter) – Fujian Province has entered the busy summer harvest season, and farmers across the province are rushing to harvest the already ripened early rice. This year, the more than 7.92 million mu of single- and double-cropping early rice in Fujian Province are generally growing well. Golden ears of rice sway in the easterly sea breeze, presenting a scene of bumper harvest everywhere. According to observations in the southern Fujian areas where the harvesting season is earlier, this year's early rice, whether in terms of total output or yield per unit area, is unprecedented. The average yield per mu of early rice in Jinjiang County this year will be 15% higher than last year, and more than 10% higher than in the bumper year of 1953. After field comparisons in Changle County, it was confirmed that the growth of early rice was stronger than last year in more than 80% of the area, 15% could maintain last year's level, and less than 4% was lower than last year. Many agricultural production cooperatives have achieved high yield records over large areas. In Zhaoliang Agricultural Cooperative in Xinchun Township, Zhao'an County, among the 125 mu of early rice that have been harvested, 9 mu yielded more than 900 jin, 41 mu yielded between 700 jin and 900 jin, and 75 mu yielded between 500 jin and 700 jin. The youth production team of this cooperative harvested 1,120 jin of dry rice from one mu of "Nante No. 1," which is currently the highest yield record among the early rice harvested in the province. The northern Fujian areas, where the harvesting season is later, are also expected to have a bumper harvest. According to the harvesting situation in various places, the Fujian Provincial Department of Agriculture estimates that the province's single- and double-cropping early rice can reach the original planned output of 2.26 billion jin, which is about 600 million jin more than last year. Now, farmers across the province are taking practical actions to ensure careful harvesting and meticulous threshing, striving to bring every grain home. They praise this year as "the era of Yao and Shun, the years of Jiaqing, with abundant harvests of grains and prosperity of livestock."

    福建早稻空前大丰收
    本报福州13日电　福建省已进入紧忙的夏收季节，全省农民正突击收割已经黄熟的早稻。今年福建省792万多亩单、双季早稻普遍生长良好，黄金似的谷穗迎着东来的海风摇幌，到处一片丰收景象。据收割季节较早的闽南部分地区观察，今年早稻不论总产量或单位面积产量，都是空前的。晋江县今年早稻每亩平均产量将高于去年15％，比丰收的1953年增产10％以上。长乐县经过田间评比，肯定早稻生长强于去年的占80％以上，有15％可以保持去年水平，低于去年的还不到4％。许多农业生产合作社中出现了大片的高额丰产纪录。诏安县新春乡照亮农业社已收获的一百二十五亩早稻，产量高达九百斤以上的有九亩，七百斤至九百斤的有四十一亩，五百斤至七百斤的有七十五亩。这个社青年生产队有一亩“南特号”收到干谷一千一百二十斤，是目前全省已收早稻中最高丰产纪录。收割季节较迟的闽北地区也可望丰收。福建省农业厅根据各地收获情况估计，全省单、双季早稻可以达到原计划产量二十二亿六千万斤，约比去年增产六亿斤以上。现在全省农民正以实际行动保证精割细打，争取颗粒返家。他们歌颂今年是“尧舜天，嘉庆年，五谷丰登，六畜兴旺。”	　　　　（雷　普）
