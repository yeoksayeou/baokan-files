Xinhua News Agency, July 21st – The Beijing State-owned Commercial System has adopted various measures since July 1st to improve the living and welfare conditions of its employees.

Regarding the issue of rent subsidies for employees living off-site, the Beijing State-owned Commercial System stipulates that subsidies should be based on the actual needs of employees, changing the past practice of simply subsidizing based on cadre rank, and concentrating resources to help employees with large families, low ranks, and those who cannot afford rent. To avoid employees running back and forth to work every day and enable them to live near their work locations, the work locations of many employees have been changed recently through organized transfers. Various commercial departments are also preparing to allocate several thousand square meters of housing area in the city as employee dormitories and sanatoriums.

These commercial departments have also revised the standards for hardship subsidies for employees, with the average monthly subsidy for cadres increasing by about 20% and for family members by about 17%. In addition, the application and subsidy procedures have been simplified. In addition to the regular hardship subsidies being issued on time, temporary difficulties due to illness, personal matters, etc., will be subsidized within two days of receiving the employee's application; if employees encounter special difficulties in their lives, they can receive an advance payment, and the matter will be resolved later based on the specific situation.

Based on the demands of mothers, commercial departments are also adding one-third more housing to the existing nurseries to accommodate more children.

    北京市国营商业系统 
    改善职工生活福利状况
    新华社21日讯　北京市国营商业系统从七月一日开始，先后采取了各种措施，改善职工生活和福利状况。
    关于在外住宿职工的房租补贴问题，北京市国营商业系统规定要从职工实际需要出发，改变过去单纯按干部级别补贴的办法，集中资力帮助人口多、级别低、出不起房租的职工。为了避免职工每天上下班奔跑，使他们能在工作地点附近住宿，经过组织调动，最近变换了许多职工的工作地点。各商业部门还准备在城内调剂出几千平方公尺面积的房屋，作为职工宿舍和疗养所。
    这些商业部门对职工生活困难补助的标准也作了修订，平均每月干部的补助费增加20％左右，家属增加17％左右。另外，还简化了申请和补助手续，除了定期的困难补助要按时发给以外，因病、事等临时性的困难，在接到职工申请后两日内发给补助；如果职工生活中发生了特殊困难的时候，可以先支钱，事后再按具体情况解决。
    商业部门还根据母亲们的要求，正在原有托儿所的基础上增添三分之一的房屋，以容纳更多的孩子。
