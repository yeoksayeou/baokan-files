Xinhua News Agency, Rangoon, 17th - Some former Kuomintang members residing in Burma have issued statements, warmly endorsing Premier Zhou Enlai's call for the peaceful liberation of Taiwan and urging patriotic Kuomintang military and political personnel to take action and accept peaceful negotiations.

    Li Chongju, former Supervisory Committee Member of the Kuomintang's Burma General Branch and current Director of the Guangdong Association of Shwebo County, recently told a reporter from the Yangon "People's Daily": "Premier Zhou's report on the Taiwan liberation issue is reasonable and fair. It would be best to liberate Taiwan peacefully." The 79-year-old Mr. Li also said: "Taiwan will definitely be liberated. Overseas Chinese hope that the motherland will be completely unified soon, and the people of Taiwan also long to escape from their suffering. Relying on others and dreaming of relying on foreign forces cannot last." He said: "Kuomintang military and political personnel should prioritize the interests of the country and the nation, respond to Premier Zhou's call for peaceful negotiations, and achieve the complete unification of our territory."

    Li Chongjie, Director of the Yangon Ningyang Association, said: "Premier Zhou, on behalf of the Central People's Government, expressed willingness to negotiate with the Taiwan authorities on the steps and conditions for the peaceful liberation of Taiwan, which shows that today's New China is broad-minded and the door of the motherland is open." He said that Premier Zhou's statement that "we have always advocated national unity and a consistent united front against foreign enemies" made him very excited. He said that now is the time for patriotic Kuomintang military and political personnel to take action in response to Premier Zhou's call.

    Chen Hongfu, an old Kuomintang member residing in Yangon, said that Premier Zhou's report truly won the hearts of the people and conformed to the current situation. If the Kuomintang does not want to be a national traitor, it should accept negotiations and bring about peace.

    侨居缅甸的前国民党人发表谈话
    要求爱国的国民党军政人员
    采取行动接受和平谈判
    据新华社仰光17日电　一些侨居缅甸的前国民党人发表谈话，热烈拥护周恩来总理关于和平解放台湾的号召，要求爱国的国民党军政人员采取行动接受和平谈判。
    前国民党缅甸总支部监察委员、现任竖磅县广东会馆理事长李崇举，最近对仰光“人民报”的记者说：“周总理关于解放台湾问题的报告合情合理，能用和平方式解放台湾是最好的事情。”这位已有七十九岁高龄的老先生还说：“台湾一定会解放，海外华侨希望祖国早日完全统一，台湾人民也盼望早日脱离苦海。寄人篱下，梦想依靠外力是不能持久的。”他说：“国民党军政人员应该以国家和民族的利益为重，响应周总理的号召和平谈判，使我国领土完全统一”。
    仰光宁阳会馆理事李崇杰说：“周总理代表中央人民政府表示愿意同台湾当局协商和平解放台湾的步骤和条件，说明今天的新中国是宽宏大量的，祖国的大门是敞开着的。”他说，周总理所说的“我们是一贯主张全民族团结、一致对外的”使他感到非常兴奋。他说，现在是爱国的国民党军政人员对周总理的号召采取行动的时候了。
    侨居仰光的老国民党员陈洪富说，周总理的报告真是深得人心，切合当前的形势。如果国民党不想作民族罪人的话，就应该接受协商，为和平造福。
