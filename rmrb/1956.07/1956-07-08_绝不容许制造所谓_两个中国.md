Absolutely No Manufacturing of the So-Called "Two Chinas" Allowed

The American ruling clique has consistently attempted to deny the existence of the People's Republic of China, wanting to exclude China from international affairs. However, this approach by the United States has not brought any benefits to itself. The People's Republic of China has not disappeared from the face of the earth because of America's non-recognition; on the contrary, it has become even stronger and more consolidated. The American policy of blockading China has not succeeded in isolating China; on the contrary, more and more countries have recognized China and established trade and cultural ties with it.

Reality is relentless. Now, some people within the American ruling clique cannot but recognize that the policy of blockading China has failed and that continuing to adhere to this policy will only isolate the United States further.

However, there are still some people who vainly attempt to create so-called "two Chinas" out of thin air, hoping to find a way out for America's China policy from this. Some people echo this proposition of creating so-called "two Chinas," believing that "recognizing two Chinas is not inconceivable." Some, while advocating that China's legitimate status in the United Nations should be restored, also believe that the Chiang Kai-shek clique should be allowed to remain in the United Nations, effectively legitimizing "two Chinas."

It should be clearly pointed out to these people that this path is absolutely impassable. As Premier and Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai pointed out at the Third Session of the First National People's Congress, "Such妄想can only be regarded as a manifestation of losing one's senses in the face of powerful reality." Taiwan is a part of China. This is a historical fact of over a thousand years and also a fact that the American government has admitted. The Chinese people will never allow the United States to separate Taiwan from China. The will and determination of the Chinese people to liberate Taiwan will never waver.

Peace-loving people all over the world and those who are fighting for independence and freedom will also never allow the creation of the so-called "two Chinas." The American occupation of China's Taiwan is the root cause of the tense situation in the Far East. The American occupation of Taiwan is also intended to exert military pressure on the Chinese people who are striving for independence. If the United States is allowed to occupy Taiwan indefinitely under the conspiracy of so-called "two Chinas," the tense situation in the Far East will not be eliminated.

Among those who echo the proposition of so-called "two Chinas," there are two types of people. One type of people supports the American policy of aggression against China. They not only verbally echo and offer ideas to the United States but also implement the plan to promote the so-called "two Chinas" in their actions. These people do not want the situation in the Far East to ease and fear the far-reaching impact of China's independence. They attempt to fish in troubled waters from the tense situation created by the United States in the Far East and profit from it.

The starting point of the other type of people may be well-intentioned. They recognize that the American occupation of Taiwan is the root cause of the tense situation in the Far East. They hope to ease the tense situation in the Far East but lack sufficient confidence in the strength of the Asian people themselves. They attempt to take a convenient path, using the method of maintaining the status quo to achieve temporary compromise, in order to eke out a temporary existence. However, they neglect the fact that the status quo of aggression against another country should not be maintained, cannot be maintained, and even more cannot be allowed to be legalized. If the conspiracy of the so-called "two Chinas" is supported, it will not only fail to ease and eliminate the tense situation in the Far East but will only allow the root cause of the tense situation to be preserved for a long time, which is extremely harmful to the cause of peace.

Today, all people with a broad political vision in Asia should recognize that Asia has undergone tremendous changes and the Asian people have awakened. Any politician who strives for the interests of their own country and nation, as long as they rely on the strength of the people, there is nothing that cannot be accomplished. And succumbing to imperialism can only lead to the loss of sovereignty and humiliation of the country and cannot have any future. The Chinese people now have full confidence in liberating their territory of Taiwan and safeguarding their sovereignty and independence. The Asian people also have the full strength to defend peace in Asia. The conspiracy to create "two Chinas" and maintain the tense situation in the Far East must never be allowed to be realized.

For the United States, if it truly dares to face the reality of the world and China, it will recognize that creating "two Chinas" is not the way out for its China policy. Otherwise, it will continue to run into walls in this dead end.

### 绝不容许制造所谓“两个中国”

    绝不容许制造所谓“两个中国”
    美国统治集团一直企图否认中华人民共和国的存在，想把中国从国际事务中排斥出去。但是，美国这种做法并没有给它自己带来任何好处。中华人民共和国并没有因为美国的不承认而从地球上消失，恰恰相反，它倒是更加强大和巩固了。美国封锁中国的政策并没有能够使得中国孤立，恰恰相反，倒是有越来越多的国家承认了中国，同中国建立了贸易和文化的联系。
    现实是无情的。现在美国统治集团中的一部分人也不能不认识到：封锁中国的政策已经失败了，继续坚持这种政策将只能使美国自己更加陷于孤立。
    可是，也还有这么一批人，他们妄想凭空地制造出所谓“两个中国”，妄想从这里来替美国的对华政策寻找出路。有些人也就附和着这种制造所谓“两个中国”的主张，认为“承认两个中国并没有什么不可思议的”。有的人虽然主张应当恢复中国在联合国的合法地位，却又认为应该容许蒋介石集团留在联合国里面，实际上使“两个中国”合法化。
    应该向这些人明白地指出，这条路是绝对走不通的。正如周恩来总理兼外交部长在第一届全国人民代表大会第三次会议上所指出的，“这种妄想只能被认为是在强大的现实面前丧失了理智的表现”。台湾是中国的一部分，这是一千年以上的历史事实，同时也是美国政府都承认过的事实。中国人民决不容许美国把台湾从中国割裂出去。中国人民解放台湾的意志和决心是绝对不会动摇的。
    全世界爱好和平和为争取独立自由而斗争的人民也决不会容许制造所谓“两个中国”。美国侵占中国的台湾，是造成远东紧张局势的根源。美国侵占台湾，也是为了对争取独立的中国人民实行武力威胁。如果容许美国在所谓“两个中国”的阴谋下无限期侵占台湾，远东的紧张局势将无法消除。
    在那些附和所谓“两个中国”的主张的人中间有两种人。一种人是支持美国侵略中国的政策的。他们不但口头附和，替美国出主意，并且在自己的行动中就贯彻着促成所谓“两个中国”的打算。这种人不希望远东局势和缓，害怕中国独立的深远影响，他们企图从美国在远东制造的紧张局势中混水摸鱼，从中取利。
    另一种人的出发点也许是善意的。他们认识到美国侵占台湾是远东局势紧张的根源。他们希望和缓远东局势，但是对于亚洲人民自己的力量还缺乏足够的信心。他们企图走一条方便的道路，用维持现状的办法来取得暂时的妥协，以便苟且偷安。但是他们忽视了对另一个国家进行侵略的现状是不应维持，也是不能维持的，更不能容许这种现状得到合法化。如果让所谓“两个中国”的阴谋得到支持，那不仅不能和缓和消除远东的紧张局势，而只能使造成紧张局势的根源长期保存下去，这是对于和平事业极端有害的。
    今天亚洲一切有远大政治眼光的人都应当认识到，亚洲已经发生了巨大的变化，亚洲人民已经觉醒了。一切为自己的国家和民族的利益而奋斗的政治家，只要依靠着人民的力量，就没有任何事情不能完成。而屈从帝国主义，除了丧权辱国以外，不可能有任何前途。中国人民现在完全有充分的信心解放自己的领土台湾，维护自己的主权和独立。亚洲人民也完全有力量保卫亚洲的和平。制造“两个中国”、保持远东紧张局势的阴谋是决不能容许它实现的。
    对于美国来说，如果它真正敢于正视世界和中国的现实，它将认识到，制造“两个中国”并不是它的对华政策的出路。否则的话，它将继续在这条死胡同里到处碰壁。
