Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, 11th. The mobilization conference of the Advanced Producer Movement of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Railway Engineering Corps opened on the 10th in a certain location in Fujian Province. Cui Tianmin, Deputy Political Commissar of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Railway Engineering Corps, said at the meeting: In the railway construction projects in the second half of this year, the Railway Engineering Corps will adopt and promote 176 kinds of advanced experiences and technologies to better complete the task of the Yingtan-Xiamen Railway and other railway construction projects.

These 176 advanced experiences and technologies were created by relevant departments of the Ministry of Railways and the Railway Engineering Corps during the construction of railways.

Participating in this conference were representatives of the Railway Engineering Corps attending the National Advanced Producer Representative Conference, representatives of advanced producers recently selected by various units, and representatives of civilian workers. During the conference, they discussed the implementation methods for carrying out the Advanced Producer Movement and exchanged advanced experiences in various aspects.

According to recent statistics from the leading organs of the Railway Engineering Corps, the Railway Engineering Corps units undertaking the task of constructing the Yingxia Railway have already produced more than 42,000 advanced producers and more than 1,100 advanced units in the socialist competition of "completing the Yingxia Railway one year ahead of schedule." They have created many advanced operation methods and tools in the construction of various projects, making the work efficiency of more than 50 major engineering projects exceed the quotas stipulated by the Ministry of Railways. They also motivated the vast number of road construction soldiers and civilian workers to launch socialist competitions.

The company led by Yin Shanglong, a representative who attended the National Advanced Producer Representative Conference, often paid attention to improving construction techniques and adopting advanced experiences when excavating a hard granite long tunnel in the Wuyi Mountains. They continuously created nine new records and, together with fraternal companies and civilian workers, opened up this tunnel approximately four months ahead of schedule.

Learning from advanced producers and disseminating advanced experiences in a timely manner has become a common practice in many units of the Railway Engineering Corps. Representatives who attended the National Advanced Producer Representative Conference and technical officers of the Railway Engineering Corps often go to various units to introduce advanced experiences. Some units also hold advanced experience seminars once a week to study and learn advanced operation methods.
