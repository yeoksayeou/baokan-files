    Corrections of a Few Typographical Errors
    In the reader's letter "Let Us Be Able to Sleep Peacefully" on the second page of the People's Daily, July 3rd, "Yunnan Yiliang Ming Coal Mine" was mistakenly written as "Yunnan Yiliang Coal Mine"; "Ruan Kesheng" was mistakenly written as "Chen Kesheng". Please correct this. (Ruan Kesheng, Yunnan Worker's Daily)
    Readers Zhang Rongnan, Liu Shuqiao, Du Jianzhi, Hou Jianmin, Gu Zhiyi, and others wrote to point out that the reader's letter "Seventy-Two Cadres, More Than Ten Organizational Forms" on the third page of this newspaper, July 7th, is inconsistent between the title and the text. The article discusses twenty-seven cadres, not seventy-two.
      Editor: The title of this article "Seventy-Two Cadres..." should be corrected to "Twenty-Seven Cadres..."

    几个错字的更正
    人民日报七月三日第二版读者来信“让我们能够安静地睡觉”一稿，把“云南宜良明煤矿”错为“云南宜良煤矿”；把“阮克生”错为“陈克生”，请予更正。（云南工人报阮克生）
    读者张荣南、刘树乔、杜建之、侯健民、顾志一等来信，指出本报七月七日第三版读者来信“七十二个干部，十多个组织形式”一稿，题文不符。稿件中谈到的是二十七个干部，不是七十二个干部。
      编者：这篇稿件的标题“七十二个干部……”应更正为“二
  十七个干部……”
