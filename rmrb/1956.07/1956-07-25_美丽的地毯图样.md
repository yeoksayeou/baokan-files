Xinhua News Agency, 22nd: The carpet manufacturing industry in Beijing has recently acquired a batch of valuable materials. This batch of materials includes more than three thousand carpet base patterns, more than nine thousand copied base patterns, carpet yarn color samples, and large samples that would require a room of about fifteen square meters to hold. These were recently donated to the Beijing First Local Industry Bureau by the jointly owned public-private Renli Flax Textile Factory. The weaving, dyeing, and knitting company under this bureau will establish a carpet research and design institution to utilize these materials and restore the inherent style of "Beijing Art Carpets."

The "Beijing Art Carpet," famous both in China and abroad, has a history of about two hundred years. It originally had its own unique style. Workers designing the patterns based their work on the patterns and colors of various artworks such as ancient porcelain, carved lacquerware, Gu embroidery, and architecture, and designed carpet patterns accordingly. Therefore, the carpets are antique and have a national style.

The jointly owned public-private Renli Flax Textile Factory was originally one of the oldest factories producing carpets in Beijing. For more than thirty years, workers collected and drew patterns from various places. A pattern depicting dragons in various flying postures was designed by workers according to the Nine-Dragon Wall in Beihai Park. There is also the "Three Kui Dragons" drawn from ancient bronze mirrors, "Peonies" and "Bamboo Branches" drawn from ancient paintings, and hunting scenes drawn from ancient steles. In addition, a pattern called Qing Dynasty Embroidery was drawn from embroidery in the Forbidden City. Carpets made using these patterns were best-selling products in the past.

    美丽的地毯图样
    新华社22日讯　北京生产地毯的行业最近获得了一批珍贵的资料。这批资料包括三千多张地毯底样，九千多张复制底样，地毯毛线色样，还有约十五平方公尺的房子才能搁得下的大样。这是公私合营仁立麻纺织厂最近送给北京市第一地方工业局的。这个局所属的织染针织公司将成立一个地毯研究设计机构，利用这批资料，恢复“北京美术地毯”的固有风格。
    驰名中外的“北京美术地毯”已经有二百年左右的历史了。原来有自己的独特风格。设计图样的工人根据古代的瓷器、雕漆、顾绣、建筑物等各种艺术品上的图案、色彩，设计成地毯图样。因此地毯古色古香，具有民族风格。
    公私合营仁立麻纺织厂原来是北京生产地毯最老的工厂之一。三十多年中工人从各处搜集和描绘图样。一幅画着各种飞舞姿势的龙的图样，就是工人按照北海九龙壁设计的。还有从古时铜镜上描绘下来的“三奎龙”，从古画上描绘下来的“牡丹”、“竹枝”，从古碑上画下来的狩猎图。另外，还有一幅名叫清朝绣的图样是从故宫的刺绣品上描下来的。用这些图样制的地毯，过去都是畅销的产品。
