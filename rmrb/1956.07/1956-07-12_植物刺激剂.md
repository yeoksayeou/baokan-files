    Plant Stimulants
    Plant stimulants are a new class of chemical drugs. Applying a small amount to a plant can cause a stimulating effect, promoting or inhibiting the growth and development of different parts of the plant. Many agents can be used to stimulate plants, among which a class of agents with a chemical structure similar to that of the plant's own growth hormones was studied earliest and most completely, and is the most valuable in practical application.
    In promoting the growth and development of plant organs, plant stimulants were first used to promote the rooting of cuttings. The effect is very significant in seedling propagation. When transplanting trees, these agents can help the plant recover. In recent years, these agents have been very successful in inducing seedless fruits in tomatoes, cucumbers, etc. In the second year after the liberation of our country, it was used in greenhouse cultivation in the suburbs of Beijing, which solved the problem of flower drop and infertility in winter tomato cultivation, and significantly increased fruit production. This application has been gradually promoted throughout the country. Trials to increase the yield of field-grown tomatoes, eggplants, etc. have also been effective. These agents also have the effect of maintaining plant freshness and preventing premature abscission of organs; they have been widely used to prolong the flowering period of ornamental plants (such as Japanese cherry blossoms) and prevent pre-harvest fruit drop in apples, etc. It also has some effect in reducing cotton boll abscission. This agent has been used to promote the ripening of some fruits, the most prominent example being figs (figs grown in Beijing gardens can be used for testing). Application of this agent can ripen the fruit one to two months earlier. This agent can also be used to promote the formation of pineapple flower buds and control its flowering period, so that pineapples do not concentrate on fruiting in one season naturally, but can have a year-round supply. Preliminary experience has been gained in Guangzhou.
    In terms of inhibiting growth and development, the use of agents is also very wide. The premature germination of many agricultural products (such as potatoes) during long-term storage and transportation causes a great loss in quality. Treatment with these agents can prevent this phenomenon from happening, and it has already been applied abroad. In areas with early frost and cold winds in spring, agents can be used to delay the germination of fruit trees to avoid damage. Excessive growth of cotton branches and leaves in autumn will affect fruit ripening; at harvest time, the leaves need to be removed first to facilitate machine harvesting. Using these agents for chemical pruning and defoliation can greatly reduce labor. In apple orchards, spraying these agents on apple flower clusters and young fruits can promote the abscission of flowers and fruits. It has been widely used for thinning flowers and fruits to avoid excessive fruiting in one year, which will affect the yield in the coming year.
    In the process of researching these agents, the most unexpected thing is that its largest use is not in stimulating growth, but in poisoning plants. It has now become the most successful herbicide used in field chemical weeding. The area treated worldwide is hundreds of millions of acres per year, and it has been considered one of the main measures for increasing crop production in modern times. Its success is mainly due to: (1) Low dosage: only one kilogram of agent is needed per hectare of field; (2) Selectivity. Appropriate use of it can inhibit weeds without harming crops; (3) It can be transmitted in plants. No matter which part of the plant it is applied to, it can be absorbed and spread throughout the plant. The agent can eradicate perennial rhizome weeds; (4) The operation process is simple and does less damage to humans, animals, soil, and machinery than other herbicides; (5) It can be manufactured cheaply and supplied in large quantities.
    The current situation of plant stimulants is as described above. At present, countries all over the world are actively exploring new and more effective agents, and are conducting comprehensive agent synthesis and testing in batches; and new effects of agents on plants are also being discovered one after another.

    植物刺激剂
    植物刺激剂是一类新的化学药品，小量地施用在植物身体上可以引起刺激的作用，促进或抑制植物不同部位的生长和发育。能够用作刺激植物的药剂有不少种，其中在化学结构上同植物体中原有的生长激素性质相类似的一类药剂研究得最早而且比较完备，并且在实用上最有价值。
    植物刺激剂在促进植物器官的生长和发育方面，首先被用来促进插枝的生根。在繁殖苗木的时候，功效很显著。在移栽树木的时候，这类药剂可以帮助植株的复原。近些年来这类药剂用在诱导番茄、黄瓜等结出无子果实上非常成功。在我国解放后的第二年就开始用在北京郊区温室栽培里，解决了冬季栽培番茄落花不孕的问题，显著地增加了果实的产量。这项应用已经在全国范围内逐渐推广。试用在提高田间种植的番茄、茄子等的产量上也有成效。这类药剂兼有维持植物新鲜和防止器官过早脱落的用处；已经大量地用在延长观赏植物（如日本樱花）的盛花期和防止苹果等熟前落果上。在减少棉铃的脱落上也有些效应。这种药剂已经用来促进有些果实的成熟，最突出的例子是无花果（北京庭园种的无花果就可以作试验），应用这种药剂可以使果实提前一至二个月成熟。这种药剂还可以用来催促菠萝花芽的形成，用来控制它的开花期，不让菠萝任其自然地集中在一个季节结实，而能够有周年结实的供应。这种方法在广州试用已经有了初步经验。
    在药剂的抑制生长和发育方面，用途也很广泛。许多农产品（如马铃薯）在长期储藏和运输途中，过早的发芽引起质量上的损失很大。用这类药剂处理，可以防止这种现象的发生，在国外已经应用。在春季有早霜和寒风的地区，利用药剂可以延迟果树发芽，免得受害。棉花在秋季枝叶陡长会影响果实的成熟；在收获的时候需要先清除叶片才便于机器收获，利用这类药剂作化学整枝和脱叶，可以大大地减省劳力。在苹果园中，这类药剂喷射在苹果花簇和幼果上，可促进花果的脱落，已大量地用来疏花和疏果，免得一年结实过多，影响来年的产量。
    在这类药剂研究的进程中，最使人预料不到的事是它的最大用量不是在刺激生长上，而是在毒害植物方面，现在已然成为田间化学除草上应用得最为成功的除莠剂。全世界每年处理的面积以亿亩计，已被认为现代作物增产的主要措施之一。它的所以这样成功主要是因为：（一）用量低、每公顷大田只要用一公斤的药剂；（二）有选择性。适当的使用它，可以将杂草抑制从而对作物没有损害；（三）可以在植物体内传导。无论施在植物那一部分都可以被吸进去而传遍植物的周身。药剂可以把多年生的宿根莠草连根除净；（四）操作过程简便而比起其他除莠剂来对人畜、土壤和机械伤害不大；（五）可以廉价制造，大量供应。
    植物刺激剂的现况已如上述。现在世界各国对新颖而更为有效的药剂正在积极的探讨，成批地进行着药剂的综合与测验；而药剂对植物的新效应也在陆续的发现中。
