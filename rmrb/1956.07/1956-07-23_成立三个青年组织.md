The congress passed a letter to fraternal parties and Thorez's summary report on the work of the French Communist Party Central Committee, and discussed the issue of establishing a French Communist Youth League. The congress decided to establish three independent Communist youth organizations: a French Communist Youth League for young men, a French Communist Women's Youth League for young women, and a French Communist Student League for students. These three organizations will each publish their own newspaper. The National Committee of the French Young Communist Movement will lead these three Communist youth organizations.

The congress adopted a letter to socialist workers based on the suggestion of Vermeersch. When presenting his suggestion, Vermeersch emphasized that this was not a direct proposal to the socialists to establish a united front, but rather to raise some questions for them, which the socialists could and should consider for the benefit of all workers.

The congress adopted a resolution on the service of Communists to the working masses in the city council. The resolution stated that the work of the city council is of particular significance in strengthening the party's ties with the working masses and striving for united action between Communists and socialists. Communist city councilors should play a major role in the struggle to improve the conditions of the masses, in the struggle for peace, for disarmament, and against capitalist exploitation.

The resolution requires Communist members of the city and provincial councils to regularly concern themselves with the interests of the working people. Communist mayors, deputy mayors, and city council members should constantly strive to realize the plans for which they earned the trust of the voters.

The resolution stated that Communist representatives in the city council should strive to stop the Algerian War, strengthen united action with the socialists, and supervise the work of the municipal authorities in accordance with the policies of the Communist Party and the interests of the people.

    成立三个青年组织
    大会通过了给各兄弟党的信和多列士关于法国共产党中央委员会工作的总结报告，并且讨论了关于成立法国共产主义青年联盟问题，大会决定成立三个独立的共产主义青年组织：为男青年成立一个法国共产主义青年联盟，为女青年成立一个法国共产主义女青年联盟，为学生成立一个法国共产主义学生联盟。这三个组织将分别发行机关报。法国青年共产主义运动全国委员会将领导这三个共产主义青年组织。
    大会根据维美徐的建议通过了告社会党劳动者书。维美徐在提出自己的建议的时候着重指出，这不是向社会党人提出建立统一战线的直接建议，而是向他们提出一些问题，为了全体劳动者的利益，社会党人是可以而且应该考虑这些问题的。
    代表大会通过了关于共产党人在市议会中为劳动大众服务的决议。决议说，在党加强同劳动大众的联系和争取共产党人和社会党人行动一致的斗争中，市议会的工作具有特殊的意义。共产党市议员应当在改善群众境况的斗争中，在争取和平、争取裁军、反对资本主义剥削的斗争中起重大作用。
    决议要求市议会和省议会中的共产党议员经常关心劳动人民利益，共产党员市长、副市长和市议会议员应当经常努力实现他们博得选民信任的那些计划。
    决议说，市议会中的共产党代表应当争取停止阿尔及利亚战争、加强同社会党人的统一行动以及根据共产党的政策和人民群众的利益来监督市政机关的工作。
