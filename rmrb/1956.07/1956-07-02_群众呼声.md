Voices of the People

	Don't "Transport in Opposite Directions"
	Many government offices and dormitories in Beijing are very far apart. Some dormitories are in the Eastern District, while the offices are in the Western District, and vice versa. As a result, there is a serious "transportation in opposite directions" during commuting hours. This not only causes severe crowding on public transportation in the city but, more seriously, wastes the precious time of thousands of cadres. If the relevant authorities could make overall plans and unified adjustments, it would be a great benefit to the cadres.
						(Yiming)

	No Home to Return To
	In some police stations in the suburbs and urban areas of Shanghai, except for Sundays and holidays, household registration police are not allowed to go home to sleep; otherwise, they will be criticized as "individualistic." Of course, fire police and traffic police on night duty should not go home due to work needs, but why are those whose work does not require it not allowed to go home either?
              (A People's Policeman)

	Appeal to "Shangri-La"
	Some people call the Nationalities Publishing House "Shangri-La." Indeed, although it is in Beijing, it does not comply with Beijing's garbage collection system. There are often several garbage bins in front of the door. When cars pass by, the rotten paper and dust from the garbage bins fly all over the street. The Fangjia Hutong Residents Committee of the Dongsi District and local residents have repeatedly raised their opinions, but they have ignored them.
                                                (Zheng Youde)

	When Will We Be Reunited?
	I work in the Surveying and Mapping Office of the Architectural Design Institute of the Urban Construction Bureau of Sichuan Province. I got married in 1954, but my wife and I are still separated. I am in Chengdu, and she is in Nanchong. We have both requested our leaders to transfer us together, but the leaders always think that we are "still young and have a long time ahead," and they do not consider our reasonable request. When will we be reunited?
                                                (Li Qingyun)

	Working Hours Are Too Long
	None of the branches of the China Department Store Beijing Company's Joint State-Private Owned Dongdan District Department Store—Wangfu, Lidu, Datong, and Dahua—have working hours of less than eleven hours. If the meeting time is included, some salespersons work up to fifteen hours. Since the beginning of summer, the weather has been hot, and until today, the salespersons have not had a lunch break.
                                                (Buping)

    群众呼声
    不要“相向运输”
    北京市有好多机关宿舍和办公室离得很远，有的宿舍在东城，办公室却在西城，有的办公室在东城，宿舍又在西城，于是，一到上下班，就发生了严重的“相向运输”，不但造成了市内公共交通工具的严重拥挤，更严重的是浪费着千万干部的宝贵时间。要是有关机关能够全面规划，统一调整一番，这对干部来说实在造福不浅。
                        （一鸣）
    有家归不得
    在上海市郊区和市区的一部分派出所里，除了星期日和假日以外，户籍警不准回家住宿，不然就被批评为“个人主义”。当然，消防警和夜间值班的交通警，为了工作需要，不应回家，为什么工作并不需要的人也一律不让回家呢？
              （一个人民警察）
    向“世外桃园”呼吁
    有人把民族出版社称为“世外桃园”，的确，它虽然在北京，却不遵守北京的垃圾收运制度。门前常常摆着几个垃圾箱，汽车驶过，就弄得垃圾箱里的烂纸和灰尘满街飞扬。东四区方家胡同居民委员会和当地群众曾一再提出意见，可是他们置之不理。　（郑幼德）
    何日得团圆
    我在四川省城市建设局建筑设计院勘测室工作，五四年就已结婚，直到现在我们夫妻还是分在两地，我在成都，她在南充。我们都曾请求领导上把我们调在一起，可是，领导上总是认为“年纪还轻，来日方长”，对我们的合理要求不予考虑。究竟什么时候才让我们夫妻团圆呢？　（黎清云）
    工时太长了
    中国百货公司北京市公司公私合营东单区百货商店的几个门市部——王府、丽都、大同、大华没有一处工时在十一小时以下，如果连开会时间计算在内，有些售货员工时达十五小时。入夏以来，天气炎热，直到今天售货员还没有午休时间。　（不平）
