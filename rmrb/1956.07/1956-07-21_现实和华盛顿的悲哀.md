    Reality and Washington's Sadness
    Hu Jin

    Year after year, American diplomats and the notorious "China Lobby" figures always launch a campaign to resist the restoration of the People's Republic of China's legitimate seat in the United Nations on the eve of the UN General Assembly, and exert tremendous diplomatic pressure on the "allies" of the United States. Now, more than a month before the opening of the General Assembly, a new such movement has begun again.

    The tricks are still old, and the tunes are still clichés, but the weight is heavier. The House of Representatives has formally passed a resolution opposing the restoration of the People's Republic of China's legitimate seat in the United Nations. Obviously, the "Cold War" strategists hope that this paper seal can be effectively affixed to the gate of the United Nations, continuing to exclude the People's Republic of China from the United Nations. It is meaningless to predict how much binding force this newly added seal will have on those who look to Washington for guidance. What is meaningful is the uneasiness in Washington reflected by this new seal. The enemies of international cooperation are in an increasingly unfavorable situation, and they are becoming more and more worried and unable to restrain themselves.

    Senate Republican Leader and one of the leading figures of the so-called "China Lobby," Knowland, openly demanded that every presidential candidate "clearly" state whether they would use their veto power after being elected to block the restoration of the People's Republic of China's seat in the United Nations. Senator Smith, a person of stature, even threatened that if the People's Republic of China's UN seat were restored, it would incite the United States to resist by force. During his recent trip to Asia, U.S. Vice President Nixon made a special trip to Taiwan to publicly state that the U.S. support for the Chiang Kai-shek group is an "unchangeable decision." Knowland's appointment as a representative to the U.S. delegation to the United Nations meetings has been touted as part of a planned action by the U.S. to obstruct the restoration of the People's Republic of China's UN seat.

    What exactly is making Washington so flustered?

    It is simply this: the People's Republic of China does not cease to exist because someone dislikes it, and all vicious hatred and curses do not detract from its development or stop the improvement of its international status. The recent establishment of diplomatic relations between Egypt and Syria and our country is a new reminder to those who blindly deny the facts.

    Certain shortsighted and influential groups in the United States not only bury their heads in the sand like ostriches, but also want to make others close their eyes and not recognize the facts. Of course, this can only put themselves in an unenviable position. As the "Pakistan Times" pointed out, "China does not lose its status as a great power by not entering the United Nations," "China is not seeking a seat in the United Nations as if it were seeking a special favor. It has not begged for what it should have. To insist that Chiang Kai-shek in Taiwan, who is under the protection of the United States, is the true representative of six hundred million Chinese is laughable, if not harmful and dangerous. It is time for this dangerous farce to end." Such criticisms of Washington's ostrich policy have been increasing recently.

    Some reactionary politicians in Washington cannot help but admit that "so-called neutral countries, as well as some of our (American) allies" strongly advocate the restoration of the People's Republic of China's seat in the United Nations. The Washington "Star" summarized this trend as: "There is this trend in the leader of the free world": "Let us be realists, and this includes realism about the Chinese Communists." This trend was powerfully reflected at the recent Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference.

    Recently, United Nations Secretary-General Hammarskjöld publicly stated that there is widespread opinion within the United Nations in favor of restoring the People's Republic of China's seat in the United Nations, that universality is the only possible basis for the United Nations, and that the issue of the People's Republic of China's seat should be resolved as soon as possible.

    Politicians with a sense of reality correctly believe that the United States' continued pursuit of a policy of hostility toward the People's Republic of China has become a serious obstacle to striving for further relaxation of international tensions and promoting international understanding and cooperation. Indian Prime Minister Nehru has repeatedly reminded people not to try to deny the reality that the People's Republic of China exists and is constantly developing. He emphasized: "It is very important that the People's Government of China must have a representative to participate in the United Nations, otherwise, all issues in the Far East cannot be properly handled." Prime Minister Nehru's opinion reflects the universal desire of peace-loving countries and peoples.

    It is precisely this universal and strong desire to recognize the unchangeable reality of the People's Republic of China and to realize the principle of universality of the United Nations in order to strengthen peace that makes those who rely on inciting hatred against the People's Republic of China and denying the legitimate rights of the People's Republic of China feel uneasy. They are afraid of losing an important pillar for maintaining the "Cold War." However, since they cannot find any politically and morally sound arguments to support their position, they cannot help but increasingly rely on imposing crude diplomatic and economic pressure on other countries.

    However, the attempt by certain groups in the United States to disregard these undeniable facts and the peaceful aspirations of the people of all countries can only result in lowering the prestige of the United States and making the United States increasingly isolated. This has been proven by the development of the situation.

    The United States Information Service said triumphantly when reporting on the resolution passed by the House of Representatives: "Today's action is the eleventh action since 1948 by the House of Representatives or the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to formally express opposition to Communist China's participation in the United Nations." However, this not-so-glorious record can only remind people of the story of King Sisyphus in Greek mythology. This king did many evil deeds during his lifetime and was sent to hell after his death, where he was punished to push a stone up a mountain, only to have it roll back down, wasting his efforts and ultimately achieving nothing. The United States has had a laborious record of not recognizing the Soviet Union for sixteen years. How much of this record does the United States want to maintain today in denying the reality of the existence of the People's Republic of China? Even in Washington, no one is sure enough to answer. This is Washington's real sadness.

    现实和华盛顿的悲哀
    胡今
    年复一年，美国的外交家和臭名远扬的“院外援华集团”人物，在联合国大会前夕，总要发动抵制恢复中华人民共和国在联合国的合法地位的运动，并对美国的“盟国”施展巨大的外交压力。现在，距联大召开日期还有一个多月，一次新的这种运动又开始了。
    花样还是旧的，叫的也是滥调，但是分量更加重了。国会众议院正式通过了一项反对恢复中华人民共和国在联合国的合法地位的决议。显然，“冷战”策士们希望这一纸封条能够灵验地贴在联合国的大门上，继续把中华人民共和国排斥在联合国之外。来预言这种封条对那些仰承华盛顿鼻息的人们还保有多大的约束力量是没有意义的，有意义的是这种新加的封条所反映出来的华盛顿的不安。国际合作的敌人的处境越来越不妙，他们也就越来越放心不下，按捺不住了。
    美国参议院共和党领袖、所谓“援华集团”的首要人物之一诺兰公开要求每一个总统候选人必须“明确”表明他们是否在当选后使用否决权来阻挠恢复中华人民共和国在联合国的席位。有地位的参议员史密斯甚至威胁说，如果恢复中华人民共和国的联合国席位，将激使美国用武力来抵抗。美国副总统尼克松最近亚洲之行，特地到台湾公开表示美国支持蒋介石集团是“不可改变的决定。”诺兰被任命为参加美国出席联合国会议代表团的代表，这事已被宣传为美国阻挠恢复中华人民共和国的联合国席位的有计划的行动之一。
    究竟什么事情使华盛顿这样慌张的呢？
    就是一件：中华人民共和国并不因为有人不喜欢它而不再存在，所有恶毒的仇视和咒骂都无损于它的发展，阻挡不住它的国际地位的提高。最近埃及和叙利亚同我国建立外交关系，对于一味否认事实的人们来说是一次新的提醒。
    鼠目寸光的美国某些有势力集团不仅自己像驼鸟一样把头埋在沙里，而且还想使别人也闭起眼睛来不承认事实，这当然只能使他们自己陷于不值得羡慕的地位。正如“巴基斯坦时报”所指出的，“中国不进入联合国仍然不失为一个大国”，“中国并不是像求特别恩惠似的谋求联合国的席位。它并没有去乞求它应当有的东西。硬说藏在美国保护下的台湾的蒋介石是六亿中国人的真正代表这种说法，如果不是有害而危险的话，也是可笑的。现在该是让这场危险的闹剧闭幕的时候了。”对于华盛顿的驼鸟政策的这种批评，近来是越来越多了。
    华盛顿的一些反动政客们也不能不承认，“所谓中立国家，以及我们（美国）的某些盟国”都强烈地主张恢复中华人民共和国在联合国的席位。华盛顿“明星报”概括这种趋势说：“在自由世界的领袖方面有这种趋势”：“让我们作为现实主义者，而这包括对中国共产党人的现实主义”。不久以前举行的英联邦总理会议上就有力地反映了这种趋势。
    最近，联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德公开表示：联合国内部有着赞成恢复中华人民共和国在联合国的席位的广泛舆论，普遍性是联合国的唯一可能的基础，中华人民共和国的席位问题应该及早得到解决。
    有现实感的政治家正确地认为，美国继续执行敌视中华人民共和国的政策，已经成了争取进一步缓和国际紧张局势、促进国际谅解和合作的严重障碍。印度总理尼赫鲁就曾经许多次地提醒人们不要企图否认中华人民共和国存在并不断发展的现实。他强调：“十分重要的是，中国的人民政府必须有代表参加联合国，不然的话，远东一切问题就无法获得适当的处理”。尼赫鲁总理的这个意见反映了爱好和平国家和人民的普遍愿望。
    正是这种要求承认中华人民共和国这个无可更改的现实和实现联合国普遍性原则以加强和平的普遍的强烈愿望，使得靠煽动对中华人民共和国的仇恨、否认中华人民共和国合法权利的人们感到惶惶不安。他们生怕失去维持“冷战”的一根重要支柱。可是他们又找不到在政治和道义上站得住脚的任何论据来支持他们的立场，就不能不越来越依靠于对其他国家加施粗暴的外交和经济压力。
    但是，美国某些集团企图漠视这些无法否认的事实和各国人民的和平愿望，除了降低美国的威信，使美国愈益陷于孤立地位以外，决不可能得到别的结果。这是已经被局势的发展所证明了的。
    美国新闻处在报道众议院通过的决议时自鸣得意地说：“今天的行动是1948年以来众议院或参议院外交委员会正式表示反对共产党中国参加联合国的第十一次行动”。但是，这种并不光荣的纪录，只能使人想起古希腊神话中西斯弗司国王的故事。这位国王生前作恶多端，死后堕入地狱，被罚推石上山，推上去又滚下来，徒费劳苦，终于无成。美国曾经有过十六年不承认苏联的劳苦纪录。今天美国要在否认中华人民共和国存在的现实上让自己保有多少这种纪录呢？连在华盛顿，也没有人有把握作出回答。这是华盛顿真正的悲哀。
