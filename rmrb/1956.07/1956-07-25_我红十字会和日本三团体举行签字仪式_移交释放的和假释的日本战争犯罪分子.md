Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, July 24th. The representatives of the Chinese Red Cross, Peng Yan and two others, today morning transferred 328 released Japanese war criminals and the paroled Rokuzo Takebe to the representatives of the Japanese Red Cross Society, the Japan-China Friendship Association, and the Japan Peace Liaison Council.

The signing ceremony was held at 9:30 this morning.

At 11:15 a.m., the representatives of the three Japanese groups met with the 328 released Japanese war criminals. At the meeting, Harada Shijio, representative of the Japan Peace Liaison Council, said: "We should express our deep gratitude for the lenient treatment of the Chinese government. After you return to your country, you must unite well and work harder to promote Sino-Japanese friendship and peace in order to repay the lenient treatment of the Chinese government."

Miyazaki Hiroshi, the representative of the released Japanese war criminals, said to the representatives of the three Japanese groups: "In the past, Japanese militarism launched a war of aggression, which caused us to commit crimes in China. When we recall these things, our hearts are filled with remorse. After we go back, we must strive for the construction of Japan and the friendship between China and Japan."

Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, July 24th. The Chinese Red Cross today agreed to the request made by eighteen family members who came to visit the sentenced Japanese war criminals to extend their stay in China from six days to three to four weeks. This was announced by Peng Yan, Deputy Secretary-General of the Chinese Red Cross, at a forum held this morning with the representatives of the three Japanese groups and the family members of the war criminals.

The Japanese government originally only agreed to allow these family members to stay in China for six days.

Peng Yan said that the Chinese Red Cross did this based on the communique issued during the previous meeting between the Chinese Red Cross and the three Japanese groups in Tianjin and the requests made by the family members of the war criminals. These family members requested the Chinese Red Cross to extend the visitation time after arriving in Tianjin yesterday.

Uesaka Akira, the eldest son of Japanese war criminal Uesaka Masaru, expressed his gratitude on behalf of all the family members.

Finally, Peng Yan answered some specific questions raised by some family members regarding the visit.

    签字仪式在今天上午九时半举行。
    上午十一点一刻日本三团体代表和328名被释放的日本战争犯罪分子见了面。日本和平联络会代表原田士骥雄在会面时说：“对中国政府的宽大处理应该深表感谢，你们回国后要很好地团结起来，更多地为促进中日友好和和平而工作，来回答中国政府的宽大处理。”
    被释放的日本战争犯罪分子代表宫崎弘向日本三团体的代表说：“过去日本军国主义发动侵略战争，使我们在中国犯了罪。我们回想起这些，内心都充满了忏悔。我们回去后一定要为日本的建设和中日两国友好而努力。”
    据新华社天津24日电　中国红十字会今天对前来探望被判刑的日本战争犯罪分子的十八名家属所提出的在中国逗留时间从六天延长到三星期到四星期的要求，表示同意。这是中国红十字会代表副秘书长彭炎在今天上午和日本三团体代表以及战争犯罪分子家属们举行的座谈会上宣布的。
    日本政府原来只同意这些家属在中国逗留六天。
    彭炎说，中国红十字会这样做是根据前次中国红十字会和日本三团体在天津会谈时发表的公报和战争犯罪分子家属们提出的要求决定的。这些家属们在昨天到达天津后就向中国红十字会提出延长探望时间的请求。
    日本战争犯罪分子上坂胜的长子上坂旭代表全体家属表示感谢。
