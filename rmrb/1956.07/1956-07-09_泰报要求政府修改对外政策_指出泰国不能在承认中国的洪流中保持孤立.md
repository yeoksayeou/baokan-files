    Thai Newspaper Demands Government Revise Foreign Policy
    Pointing Out Thailand Cannot Remain Isolated in the Torrent of Recognition of China
    Xinhua News Agency, Bangkok, 8th -- The "Eternal Daily" said in an editorial: "No matter how close the relationship between Thailand and the United States is, Thailand must not remain isolated in the torrent of its neighboring countries recognizing China."
    The Thai newspaper published an editorial on July 4th, demanding that Thailand revise its foreign policy to conform to the new world situation.
    The newspaper pointed out that Thailand is surrounded by friends of China. The United States may not suffer much, because it is located in another corner of the world.
    The newspaper said that the United States may think it is a world power, and everyone must follow its ideas. But the current situation is that anti-Americanism in Asia has become the leader in ideology, and what the United States comes up with each time is amazing. For example, it condemns neutral countries as "immoral" and "shortsighted." "Certainly, this kind of thinking is increasingly falling behind the times, and the group of neutral countries will undoubtedly grow stronger."

    泰报要求政府修改对外政策
    指出泰国不能在承认中国的洪流中保持孤立
    新华社8日讯　曼谷消息：“永恒报”在一篇社论中说：“即使泰国和美国之间的关系是怎样密切，泰国也必定不能够在它的邻国都承认中国的洪流中保持着孤独。”
    这家泰国报纸在七月四日发表社论，要求泰国修改自己的外交政策，使它符合新的世界情势。
    这家报纸指出，泰国周围都是中国的朋友。美国可能不会有什么痛苦，因为它是身处于世界的另一个角落。
    报纸说，美国可能认为自己是世界上的强国，美国的思想谁都得遵从。但是目前的情况是，亚洲反美已经成为思想方面的领导者了，而美国每次想出来的东西却都是令人惊异的。例如它谴责中立国家是“不道德”和“短视”。“肯定地说，这种思想已经是日益落在时代的后面了，中立的国家集团毫无疑问一定会日益壮大起来”。
