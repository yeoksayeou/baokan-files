After the implementation of the full industry-wide public-private partnership in capitalist industry and commerce, how should the national industrial and commercial departments, the public representatives and employees in public-private joint ventures establish good working relationships with the private sector? This is a central issue in current public-private relations. To solve this problem, a series of ideological and organizational work is needed, and holding regular symposiums with industrial and commercial circles is a very important and effective method. The national symposium of industrial and commercial circles recently convened by relevant departments of the State Council provides a model for realizing this method.

Why should we hold symposiums with industrial and commercial circles?

First, let’s talk about implementing the state's policy of transforming capitalist industry and commerce. Our country's policy must and will be implemented. However, the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce is an arduous and complex task, involving fundamental changes in capitalist relations of production and the gradual transformation of bourgeois elements into laborers. In this great historical event, in the implementation of the state's various policies, there will inevitably be uneven progress in work, inconsistent understanding among cadres in various regions, and phenomena of excess or deficiency in individual issues. Many unforeseen new problems will inevitably arise, and there will be some tortuous processes. To reduce deviations, minimize obstacles, and overcome difficulties, the most important thing is to have mutual communication between the public and private sectors, and between superiors and subordinates. What should we do? The best way is to conduct regular and periodic symposiums with industrial and commercial circles, fully reflect the situation, and frankly exchange opinions, so that both sides can reach a consensus. This can not only help state organs, public representatives and employees in enterprises to be more confident in implementing policies and overcome the fear of being either too “left” or too “right”; it can also enable industrial and commercial circles to know the whole story and dispel their concerns about the policy not being implemented due to the shortcomings of certain work.

Secondly, let’s talk about enterprise transformation and the personal transformation of bourgeois elements. After capitalist enterprises become socialist public-private joint ventures, in order to change enterprise management and improve production levels, this requires great efforts from both the public and private sectors to find various ways to meet the needs of enterprise development. However, all work ultimately depends on people, and so-called people's work is mainly reflected in working relationships. If the working relationship is good, everyone can exchange opinions frankly, and all forces can be transformed into positive factors, which will unleash tremendous creativity and overcome various negative factors. Therefore, other personnel arrangements, wages, benefits, and other issues will be much easier to solve, and enterprise production will easily get on track. Only when the working relationship is good can the work of uniting and transforming the private sector be carried out more easily.

Holding regular symposiums with industrial and commercial circles is a relatively easy method to implement. However, can such meetings be held well? That is, can they truly solve problems? There are many concerns. These concerns mainly come from national industrial and commercial departments. Some people are afraid of holding such meetings, they are afraid of facing criticism of their work in the meetings, or afraid that industrial and commercial circles will raise some difficult to solve requests. And other people, although they do not oppose holding meetings, always feel that not many problems can be solved in such meetings, and therefore hold a perfunctory attitude. Why do these situations arise? This is due to insufficient understanding of the possibility and necessity of working with the private sector.

The current industrial and commercial figures in China have undergone several years of education, their political awareness has generally improved, and a large number of activists accepting socialist transformation and a considerable number of progressive core members have gradually emerged. Today, the vast majority of private sector personnel are already positive factors in our country. As long as we are good at consulting with them and make good use of them, we will certainly be able to reasonably solve various problems and jointly overcome the difficulties in the socialist transformation.

From another perspective, since the upsurge of socialist transformation, thousands of capitalist factories and shops have implemented public-private joint ventures. To manage these enterprises well, the national industrial and commercial departments must make double efforts and strengthen leadership in all aspects, but at the same time, they must also absorb and give play to the strength of industrial and commercial circles. The Chinese national bourgeoisie is different from the bureaucratic bourgeoisie. Most of them have certain abilities and experience in business management, science and technology, or production skills. Their abilities and experience must be used and they must be regarded as the wealth of the country. They must not be regarded as a "burden" simply because the handling of certain events or certain individuals is relatively difficult.

Why were fewer symposiums held in the past? Why were some symposiums not held well? It is because the important role that symposiums can play has not been sufficiently estimated. Many opinions and criticisms raised by industrial and commercial circles on our various tasks have not been regarded as an important way to improve our work. If the positive significance of this aspect is not fully recognized, then symposiums will not be held frequently, and useful things will not be absorbed and explored in the symposiums. In order to hold good symposiums, we must not be afraid of negative opinions, not be afraid of sharp criticisms. The opinions and criticisms raised by industrial and commercial circles sometimes have one-sidedness, but they should also be allowed to express them. One-sided opinions can be analyzed and explained, not to mention that many opinions are helpful for us to improve our work. In order to encourage everyone to express their opinions, the conveners of the meeting are required to encourage and support the industrial and commercial circles to express their opinions in all aspects, and be good at listening to different and opposing opinions at the meeting. The industrial and commercial figures participating in the meeting should also make ideological preparations in advance. Within the possible scope, it would be very beneficial to go to certain areas to deeply understand some aspects of the situation and make some of their views more practical.

The national symposium of industrial and commercial circles convened by relevant departments of the State Council has made a good start. In the future, such meetings need to be held frequently, and they should be held from the central government to various provinces and cities, and even to some market towns. Such meetings can be large or small; they can be regular or irregular; they can be professional or comprehensive. But no matter what kind of meeting, to make it a good one, it should have leadership, preparation, and a focus. That is to say: local industrial and commercial departments should actively and proactively convene such meetings, and the Federation of Industry and Commerce and the China Democratic National Construction Association can also urge and propose them. The content of the symposium should be notified to the participants in advance so that they have sufficient time to prepare their opinions. The person in charge of the main business must participate in the symposium. The main issues involved in the symposium should be answered as much as possible. Other issues that cannot be resolved or are not easy to resolve for the time being can be temporarily unresolved, and continue to be discussed and resolved later. At present, in order to gain experience, such meetings can be held first at the central and provincial levels, and after they are effective, counties and market towns will be able to convene them in the same way.

Holding symposiums with industrial and commercial circles is a work of great political significance. Local party committees and united front work departments should strengthen leadership, industrial and commercial departments should actively prepare, industrial and commercial figures should actively participate, and such meetings must be held well.

### 开好工商界座谈会

    开好工商界座谈会
    全国资本主义工商业实行全行业公私合营以后，国家的工商业务部门、公私合营企业中的公方代表和职工，如何同私方人员建立良好的共事关系呢，这是当前公私关系的一个中心问题。解决这个问题，需要进行一系列的思想工作和组织工作，而定期地召开工商界座谈会，则是一项十分重要的和有效的办法。国务院有关部门最近召开的全国工商界座谈会，为实现这项办法提供了一个范例。
    为什么要召开工商界座谈会呢？
    首先，就贯彻国家改造资本主义工商业的政策来谈。我们国家的政策，是一定要贯彻也一定能够贯彻的。但是，资本主义工商业的社会主义改造是一件艰巨复杂的大事，它包含着资本主义生产关系的根本变化，和资产阶级分子逐渐转变为劳动者的过程。在这个巨大的历史事变中，在执行国家的各项政策的时候，一定会出现工作进度先后不齐、各地干部的认识不一，和个别问题上的过与不及的现象。一定会发生很多预想不到的新问题，会经过一些曲折的过程。为了缩小偏差，减少阻碍，克服困难，最重要的就是使公私之间、上下之间互相通气。怎么办呢？最好的办法就是经常的定期的和工商界进行座谈，充分反映情况，坦白交换意见，使双方认识一致。这就既可以帮助国家机关、企业中的公股代表和职工，在执行政策的时候更有把握些，克服既怕左又怕右的情绪；也可以使工商界知道底细，解除由于某些工作的缺点而在他们之中引起的耽心政策不能贯彻的顾虑。
    其次，就企业改造和资产阶级分子的个人改造来谈。资本主义企业变为社会主义性质的公私合营企业以后，为了改变企业经营管理工作和提高生产水平，这就要求公私双方作很大的努力，想各种办法，以满足企业发展的需要。但是，一切工作终归仍然决定于人，而所谓人的工作，又主要表现在共事关系上。共事关系搞好了，大家能坦率地交换意见了，一切力量都能变为积极的因素了，那就会发挥巨大的创造力，克服各种消极因素。因之其他人事安排、工资福利等等问题解决起来也就容易得多了，企业的生产也就容易走上轨道。也只有共事关系搞好了，对私方人员的团结改造工作才更容易进行。
    定期召开工商界座谈会，这个办法是比较容易实行的。但是，这样的会议能不能开得好呢？也就是说是否能真正的解决问题呢？顾虑却是颇多的。这种顾虑主要来自国家工商业务部门。有的人害怕开这种会议，他们害怕面对面地在会上批评工作中的缺点，或者害怕工商界在会上提出一些难以解决的要求。而另外一些人则是虽然并不反对召开会议，但是总认为这样的会上解决不了多少问题，因而抱着应付的态度。为什么会产生这些情况呢？这是由于对同私方人员共事的可能性和必要性认识不足的原故。
    中国目前的工商界人士，已经经过了几年的教育，政治觉悟普遍有所提高，并且逐渐增多地出现了大批接受社会主义改造的积极分子和相当数量的进步核心分子。今天，绝大多数的资方人员已经是我们国家的积极因素了。只要善于同他们进行协商，很好地使用他们，就一定能够合理地解决各种问题，共同克服社会主义改造工作中的困难。
    从另一方面来看，自从社会主义改造高潮到来以后，成千成万资本主义的工厂和商店实行了公私合营。要管好这些企业，国家的工商业务部门固然要加倍努力，从各方面加强领导，同时也必须吸收和发挥工商界的力量。中国的民族资产阶级和官僚资产阶级分子不同，他们在经营管理、科学技术或生产技能上，大多数人都具有一定的能力和经验。必须把他们的这种能力和经验运用起来，把他们看作是国家的财富，决不可以因为对某些事件或某些人物的处理比较困难，笼统地把他们看作一个“包袱”。
    座谈会过去为什么开得少？有些座谈会为什么开得不好呢？就是因为没有足够估计座谈会所能起的重要作用。没有把工商界对我们各项工作所提出的许多意见和批评，看作是改进工作的一个重要方法。如果没有充分认识这一方面的积极意义，那就不会多开座谈会，就不会在座谈会上去吸收和发掘有用的东西。为了开好座谈会，就要不怕反面的意见，不怕尖锐的批评，工商界提出的意见和批评，有时也有片面性，但也要让他们发表出来。片面的意见，可以进行分析、加以解释，何况有许多意见，是有助于我们改进工作的。为了使大家把意见说出来，这就要求会议的主持者，从各方面鼓励和支持工商界发表意见，善于听取会议上不同的和对立的意见。参加会议的工商界人士，也应该事先作好思想酝酿的准备工作。在可能范围内，如果能到一定地区深入了解各方面的一些情况，使自己的某些看法更实际一些，这更是十分有益的办法。
    国务院有关部门召开的全国工商界座谈会，已经作了一个良好的开端。今后，这种会议还需要经常举行，从中央到各省市以至某些集镇都要分别召开。这种会议可以是大型的也可以是小型的；可以是定期的也可以是不定期的；可以是专业性的也可以是综合性的。但是无论那一种会议，要使它开得好，都应该有领导、有准备、有中心。这就是说：各地工商业务部门，应该积极地主动地来召开这种会议，工商联合会和民主建国会也可以督促和提议。座谈会的内容，应该事先通知参加会议的人员，以便有充分时间准备意见。座谈会一定要主管业务的负责人参加。座谈中涉及的主要问题，要尽可能有答复，其它一时不能解决或者不容易解决的问题，可以暂时不作定论，继续交谈，以后再去解决。目前，为了取得经验，可以先在中央和省市一级召开这种会议，行之有效以后，县和集镇就好依样召开了。
    召开工商界座谈会，是一项具有重要政治意义的工作。各地党委和统战部门应该加强领导，工商业务部门应该积极准备，工商界人士应该踊跃参加，一定要开好这种会议。
