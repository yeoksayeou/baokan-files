Xinhua News Agency, Rangoon, July 19th: According to a report in the "Burmese People's Daily" on July 18th, Mr. Sebald, Assistant Secretary of State for Far Eastern Affairs of the United States, has left Rangoon on July 14th after a four-day visit. He has learned of the Burmese government's attitude towards the proposed US loan.

Sebald held talks in Rangoon with Prime Minister U Ba Swe and U Nu, Chairman of the Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League, on the US loan issue. The "Burmese People's Daily" said that Sebald is believed to have clarified the new US proposals for granting loans to Burma.

The newspaper said it is understood that the Burmese side has indicated to the United States through Sebald that US loans must be absolutely unconditional and that there should be no restrictions on how and where Burma uses these dollar loans. That is to say, Burma must have the right to freely purchase what it needs and what kind of goods it needs from any country it wishes.

Burma also told Sebald that the dollar loans would mainly be used to build five textile factories and to accelerate the construction of jute and sugar factories.

    新华社仰光19日电　据“缅甸人报”七月十八日报道：美国负责远东事务的助理国务卿帮办赛鲍尔作了四天的访问以后已经在七月十四日离开仰光。他已经获悉了缅甸政府对拟议中的美国贷款的态度。
    赛鲍尔在仰光同吴巴瑞总理和反法西斯人民自由同盟主席吴努就美国贷款问题举行了会谈。“缅甸人报”说：据信，赛鲍尔阐明了美国向缅甸提出的给予贷款的新建议。
    报纸说，据悉，缅甸方面已经通过赛鲍尔向美国表明，美国的贷款必须是绝对无条件的，不应对缅甸怎样使用和在哪里使用这些美元贷款的问题加以任何限制。也就是说，缅甸必须有权可以自由地从它所愿意的任何国家购买它所需要的东西，和购买它所需要的任何种类的货物。
    缅甸还告诉赛鲍尔说，美元贷款主要的将用来建筑五个纺织工厂和加速黄麻厂和制糖厂的建筑工程。
