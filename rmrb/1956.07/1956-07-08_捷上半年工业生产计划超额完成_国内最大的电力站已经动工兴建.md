Xinhua News Agency, Prague, July 6th— Czechoslovakian State Planning Committee Vice-Chairman Przek announced on July 5th that, according to preliminary statistics, Czechoslovakia's industrial production plan for the first half of 1956 has been overfulfilled by 102%.

Przek said that in agriculture, in the first five months of this year, the number of members of agricultural cooperatives in Czechoslovakia increased by 53,818, and the cultivated land of the cooperatives increased by more than 223,000 hectares. Thus, the total number of agricultural cooperatives has increased to 7,782. Przek pointed out that the cooperatives are becoming increasingly consolidated economically, and the peasants themselves are increasingly convinced of the benefits of collective farming.

Xinhua News Agency, Prague, July 7th— Construction of Czechoslovakia's largest power plant began on July 5th in Opatovice.

The power plant will have a generating capacity of 300,000 kilowatts, covering an area of ​​93 hectares (approximately 1,400 mu), and is expected to be fully completed by 1960. Its first turbine will generate electricity in less than three years.

This power plant uses inferior coal as fuel. Workers at the Gotwald Steel Factory in Vitkovice will build many boilers weighing 230 tons for this power plant.

According to the Second Five-Year Plan, Czechoslovakia's power generation will increase from 15 billion kilowatt-hours in 1955 to 25.3 billion kilowatt-hours in 1960. During the five years, in addition to the completion of the Opatovice power plant, the large thermal power plants in Porici, Tisova and Komorany, as well as the Nosice, Skalka, Krpelany, Sucany on the Vah River and the Lipno hydropower station on the Vltava River will also be completed.

    新华社布拉格6日电　捷克斯洛伐克国家计划委员会副主席普泽克七月五日宣布，据初步统计，捷克斯洛伐克1956年上半年的工业生产计划已经以102％超额完成。

    新华社布拉格7日电　捷克斯洛伐克最大的电力站已经在七月五日在奥帕托维泽动工兴建。
    这个电力站的发电能力将有三十万瓩，占地九十三公顷（约合一千四百市亩），预计到1960年可以全部建成。它的第一台涡轮机将在不到三年的时间内发电。
    这个电力站是利用劣等的煤作燃料的。维特科维泽的哥特瓦尔德钢铁工厂的工人将为这个电力站建造许多重达二百三十吨的锅炉。
    根据第二个五年计划规定，捷克斯洛伐克的发电量将从1955年的一百五十亿度增加到1960年的二百五十三亿度。在五年中，除建成奥帕托维泽的电力站以外，还将建成波里齐、蒂索瓦和科莫拉尼的大火力发电厂，以及诺西泽、斯卡尔卡、克尔佩拉尼、发格河上的苏查尼和弗尔塔瓦河上的利普诺水电站等。
