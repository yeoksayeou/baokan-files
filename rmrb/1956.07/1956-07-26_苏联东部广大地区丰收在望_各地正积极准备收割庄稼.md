Moscow Dispatch from Our Newspaper, July 25th: The vast eastern regions of the Soviet Union, including Kazakhstan, the Urals, and Siberia, are expecting a bumper harvest this year. Almost all of the newly cultivated land in the Soviet Union is in these regions. The upcoming harvest is receiving great attention. Tens of thousands of combine harvesters and harvester operators from all over the Soviet Union, as well as students on vacation, are flocking to the east to support this harvest, which is of great significance to this year's agricultural yield. Soviet party and government leaders, headed by Comrade Khrushchev, have been holding meetings with agricultural workers in the Urals and Siberia for days to arrange the battle to welcome this harvest.

The good crops ripening on the new land in Kazakhstan foreshadow an unprecedented bumper harvest this year. State farms and collective farms in many districts of Akmolinsk Oblast and Kokchetav Oblast are expected to produce more than 100 poods (one pood is approximately 33 Chinese jin) of grain per hectare. Local workers, filled with joy, are actively preparing more granaries.

The grain in the vast majority of state farms and collective farms in Siberia and the Urals is also growing very well. The new land there will also yield 100 poods of grain per hectare. Now it depends on how the harvesting work is organized. In the past few years, in Siberia and the Urals, grain was often lost due to prolonged harvesting times. The harvest yield per hectare in some collective farms differed by about half between the beginning and the end of the harvest. In particular, the grain in Siberia ripens later and the weather turns cold earlier, making it even more important to shorten the harvesting period.

In order to shorten the harvesting period and avoid grain loss, the method of two-stage harvesting is being widely promoted in rural areas throughout the Soviet Union. This method, which was already adopted last year, is being implemented even more extensively this year in the southern Russian regions of Stavropol and Kuban. The two-stage harvesting method involves cutting the crops a few days before they are ripe and then threshing them. This method has the advantages of early harvesting, shortening the harvesting time, and reducing grain loss. Southern Russian experience has shown that this method can increase the yield by 250 to 300 kilograms of grain per hectare. Kazakhstan and Siberia often experience rainy seasons during the harvest period, making the use of two-stage harvesting particularly advantageous. This method is now being prepared for widespread promotion in the eastern regions of the Soviet Union. Rural areas in Siberia and the Urals will use this method to harvest eight million hectares of grain, which is estimated to yield an additional 100 million poods of grain.

### 苏联东部广大地区丰收在望  各地正积极准备收割庄稼

    苏联东部广大地区丰收在望
    各地正积极准备收割庄稼
    本报莫斯科25日电　苏联东部广大地区，包括哈萨克斯坦、乌拉尔、西伯利亚，今年丰收在望。苏联新垦的土地几乎全部都在这些地区。即将来临的丰收受到人们的巨大注意。全苏各地成千成万联合收割机和收割机手，假期中的青年学生，纷纷来到东部支援这场对今年农业收成有重大意义的收割。以赫鲁晓夫同志为首的苏联党政领导人员连日在乌拉尔和西伯利亚召开了农业工作人员会议，布置迎接这场收割的战斗。
    在哈萨克斯坦新地上成熟着的好庄稼预示今年丰收将是空前未有的。阿克摩林斯克州和柯克齐塔夫州的许多区的国营农场和集体农庄预计每公顷将产谷物一百普特（一普特约合我国33斤）以上。满怀喜悦的当地劳动者积极准备着更多的谷仓。
    西伯利亚和乌拉尔绝大多数国营农场和集体农庄的谷物都长得很好。那里的新地每公顷也将收一百普特谷物。现在要看收割工作是怎样组织的。过去几年，在西伯利亚和乌拉尔，往往因为收割时间拖长，谷物遭到损失。有些集体农庄每公顷的收获量在收割开头时和结尾时相差约一半。特别是西伯利亚的谷物熟得较晚而天气冷得较早，更要缩短收割期间。
    为了缩短收割期间和避免谷物损失，苏联各地农村广泛推行着分段收割方法。这个在去年已经开始采用的方法，今年在斯塔夫罗波尔和库班等南俄地区更加普遍施行。分段收割法，就是把差几天就要成熟的庄稼割下然后再进行打谷。这个方法有提早收割、缩短收割时间、减少谷物损失的种种好处。南俄经验证明，用这个方法每公顷可以多收二百五十到三百公斤谷物。哈萨克斯坦和西伯利亚在收割时期常逢雨季，使用分段收割法特别有利。现在苏联东部地区准备广泛推行这个方法。西伯利亚和乌拉尔的农村将用这个方法收打八百万公顷谷物，据估计，将多收一亿普特谷物。
