Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, July 4th. More than 18 million mu of early rice in Jiangxi Province are generally ripening, and harvesting has begun in the southern regions. According to surveys in counties such as Xinfeng, Dayu, Longnan, Nankang, and Anyuan, the early rice already harvested in these counties has generally increased by about 10% to 30% per mu compared to last year. According to the Department of Agriculture, the unit area yield of early rice in the province may increase by 8.6% compared to last year. With the increase in planting area, the total output of early rice in the province this year will increase by about 1.6 billion jin compared to last year.

Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, July 4th. This year, more than 20 million mu of winter wheat in Shandong Province have increased production by more than 600 million jin due to irrigation.

Shandong Province experiences spring droughts almost every year, and coupled with a lack of irrigation conditions, wheat yields have not increased rapidly. Since last winter, under the influence of the upsurge in agricultural cooperation, farmers have launched a campaign to build farmland water conservancy projects, enabling more than 30% of the province's nearly 60 million mu of winter wheat to be irrigated. These irrigated wheat fields generally yield more than 30 jin per mu than dry land wheat.

    江西早稻可增产十六亿斤
    山东麦田得到灌溉增产六亿斤
    新华社南昌4日电　江西省一千八百多万亩早稻普遍黄熟，南部地区开始收割。据信丰、大庾、龙南、南康、安远等县调查，这些县份到目前为止已经收割的早稻，一般每亩都比去年增产了10％到30％左右。据农业厅估计，全省早稻单位面积产量可比去年增产8.6％，加上播种面积的增加，今年全省早稻总产量将比去年增加十六亿斤左右。
    新华社济南4日电　今年山东省有两千多万亩冬小麦，由于得到灌溉而增产六亿多斤。
    山东省几乎每年都要发生春旱，加之缺乏灌溉条件，小麦产量提高不快。去冬以来，农民们在农业合作化高潮的影响下，展开了兴修农田水利运动，使全省近六千万亩冬小麦的30％以上得到灌溉。这些经过水浇的麦田，每亩一般都比旱田小麦增产三十斤以上。
