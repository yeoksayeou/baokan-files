Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi Dispatch from Vietnam News Agency: The Deputy Director of the State Planning Commission of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, Nguyen Van Tran, announced that grain production in northern Vietnam has exceeded the targets set by the national plan. According to the plan, the rice yield per hectare should be 1.6 tons. However, in some areas, the yield reached 2.8 tons or even 4 tons. The output of other grains also exceeded the plan. However, he pointed out that due to insufficient preparation, the planting of certain industrial crops has not been able to reach the prescribed targets.

In the industrial sector, the industrial output in the first five months of 1956 has reached 40.3% of the annual planned output, coal 46.5%, cement 49.3%, and raw silk 43%.

In the small-scale industry and handicraft sector, the number of technicians has increased by more than 10,000 compared to last year. The total value of bricks, tiles, cloth, and agricultural implements produced in the first five months of this year increased by more than 37% compared to the entire previous year.

The prices of many important necessities for the people, such as rice, sugar, cloth, and petroleum, are stable, and some have even been reduced.

    越南工农业生产增长
    新华社据越南通讯社讯　越南民主共和国政府国家计划委员会副主任阮文珍宣布，越南北部粮食生产已经超过国家计划所规定的目标。根据计划，每公顷的稻产量应该是一点六吨。但是，在某些地区，产量达到了二点八吨甚至到四吨。其他谷物的产量也超过了计划。但是，他提出，由于准备得不够，某些工业作物的种植还没有能够达到规定的目标。
    在工业方面，1956年头五个月的工业生产量已经达到全年计划产量的40.3％、煤为46.5％、水泥49.3％、生丝43％。
    小型工业和手工业方面，技工人数比去年增加了一万多名。今年头五个月生产的砖、瓦、布匹和农具的总值比去年全年增加了37％以上。
