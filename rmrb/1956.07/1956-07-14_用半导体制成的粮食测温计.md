    Grain Thermometer Made with Semiconductors

    (Our report) A grain thermometer made with semiconductors has been manufactured in Shanghai. The Shanghai No. 1 Grain Warehouse conducted a test on the 5th. The test results proved that this thermometer has high sensitivity and accuracy. This thermometer was successfully developed on the 4th by Jiang Hanluo, a technician at the Shanghai Joint State-Private Enterprise Chuangzao Electrical Instrument Industrial Cooperative.

    The shape of this thermometer resembles a javelin thrown by an athlete. After it is inserted into a grain pile, the meter on the other part of the thermometer indicates the accurate temperature of the grain in less than twenty seconds, and it can measure the different temperatures of the upper, middle, and lower layers of the grain pile. Using it to measure the temperature of grain is much more accurate than using the mercury thermometers used in the past, and the efficiency can be increased by more than a hundred times. With this thermometer, the grain department can quickly and accurately grasp the temperature of the grain in the warehouse and prevent the grain from mildewing in time. The Shanghai grain department plans to manufacture more than one hundred of these thermometers this year for trial use by grain storage and transportation departments in various regions.

    Making various temperature measuring instruments with semiconductor selenium has important applications in medical treatment, water temperature measurement, and industrial construction.

    用半导体制成的粮食测温计
    本报讯　一种用半导体制成的粮食测温计在上海制造出来了。上海市第一粮食仓库在五日进行了试验。试验结果，证明这种测温计具有很高的灵敏度和准确性。这种测温计是上海公私合营创造电工仪器工业社技术人员江汉罗在四日试制成功的。
    这种测温计的形状像运动员投掷的标枪，当它插入粮食堆中以后，不到二十秒钟，测温计的另一部件电表上，就指出粮食的准确温度来，而且它能测出粮堆的上、中、下三层不同的温度。用它来测量粮食的温度，比过去采用的水银测温器要准确得多，效率可提高一百多倍。粮食部门有了这种测温器以后，就能又快又准确地掌握仓库粮食的温度，及时防止粮食霉烂。上海粮食部门准备在年内制造出一百多只这种测温计，给各地粮食储运部门试用。
    用半导体硒制成各种测温仪器，它在医疗、水温测量和工业建设上都有很重要的作用。
