Xinhua News Agency, New York, July 13th: According to TASS, at the United Nations Disarmament Commission meeting on July 12th, the Soviet representative Gromyko stated that, in order to break the deadlock on the disarmament issue, he, on behalf of the Soviet government, announced that the Soviet Union is willing to accept the level of armed forces reduction of major powers proposed by Western countries for the second time as the first step in resolving the disarmament problem, and is prepared to sign a corresponding agreement.

　　This level is: 2.5 million each for the Soviet Union, the United States, and China, which is one million more than the level first proposed by Western countries and already accepted by the Soviet Union; and 750,000 each for the United Kingdom and France, which is 100,000 more than the level first proposed by Western countries as well.

　　In his speech, Gromyko pointed out that more than ten years of negotiations on the disarmament issue have not only failed to bring the problem closer to resolution, but have instead moved it further away from practical resolution. He pointed out that the reason for this is that the Western powers have adopted a fickle attitude on the entire disarmament issue, especially on the issue of banning nuclear weapons and the level of armed forces of major powers.

　　In order to make progress in resolving the disarmament issue, he was authorized to declare that the Soviet Union is willing to accept the level of armed forces of major powers proposed by Western countries for the second time, although the Soviet Union hopes for a larger-scale reduction of armed forces.

　　Gromyko reiterated the Soviet Union's plan for supervising disarmament, and pointed out that the Western proposal for aerial photography has nothing to do with reducing armaments. He pointed out that, in this regard, the remarks of French representative Moch were noteworthy, as he had expressed doubts about the value of aerial photography methods.

　　Gromyko pointed out that certain achievements already made in resolving many important political issues that complicate international relations make it possible to begin practical resolution of the disarmament issue. He then described some of the proactive measures taken by the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries in terms of disarmament, and refuted the various absurd arguments put forward by the ruling groups of Western countries in an effort to diminish the great significance of these measures.

　　Gromyko said that the Soviet Union believes that the current international situation allows countries to unilaterally implement concrete measures to reduce armaments and armed forces before reaching international agreements on the issue of reducing armaments. Doing so will help to further ease international tensions and consolidate trust between countries, which in turn will create more favorable conditions for resolving important international political issues and implementing comprehensive disarmament plans. He expressed that the Soviet Union would sincerely welcome the steps taken by other countries to achieve this goal.

　　He said that the Soviet Union's patient and consistent efforts to reach a disarmament agreement have eliminated most of the excuses used by the West to oppose Soviet proposals. Now some people say that the disarmament problem cannot be solved without first resolving international disputes. He pointed out that linking these two completely different issues together only makes both disarmament and the resolution of outstanding political issues unnecessarily difficult.

　　Gromyko reiterated that the Soviet Union has always advocated resolving pressing political issues and establishing the necessary trust, mutual understanding, and cooperation between countries, so as to achieve the normalization of relations between countries. He cited concrete facts to illustrate that the important problems in current international relations have not yet been resolved, and those groups in Western countries who are unwilling to disarm should be held responsible.

　　Gromyko then analyzed the outstanding international issues. When talking about the German issue, he reiterated the proposal to achieve German reunification through direct contact between the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany.

　　When talking about the Far East issue, Gromyko pointed out that the most pressing issue in the Far East is the issue of granting the People's Republic of China its legitimate rights in the United Nations. He said that the People's Republic of China, with a population of 600 million, is a major power; its outstanding role in the international community is recognized by the people of all countries; and many countries have established normal relations with China. Obstructing the representatives of the People's Republic of China from obtaining its legitimate seat in the United Nations will only undermine the prestige of this organization and damage the cause of peace.

　　Gromyko said that there is only one reason preventing the resolution of this long-matured international issue, and that is that the ruling groups in the United States have stubbornly tried to force the whole world to believe for seven years that the People's Democratic China, with a population of 600 million, does not exist, as if China were the bankrupt Chiang Kai-shek clique hiding on the island of Taiwan under US military occupation.

　　Gromyko also talked about the Vietnam issue, the Southeast Asia aggressive bloc, the Korean issue, and the tense situation in the Near and Middle East.

　　Gromyko said that the argument that it seems impossible to resolve the disarmament problem before the disputed international issues are resolved is completely artificial and far-fetched. The purpose of Western countries in linking these issues with the disarmament problem now is only to create new obstacles and sabotage disarmament, hindering the resolution of international disputes.

　　He said that the way out for practical resolution of the disarmament problem lies in immediately taking concrete measures that can lead to the reduction of armed forces and armaments, and lead to the prohibition of atomic weapons. The Soviet Union has put forward its own suggestions, and the Soviet Union firmly believes that its suggestions can become the basis for such concrete measures.

　　Gromyko then put forward the following suggestions:

　　1. Major powers should solemnly guarantee not to use atomic weapons and hydrogen weapons, and unconditionally prohibit atomic weapons and hydrogen weapons; it is suggested to conclude an agreement prohibiting weapons of mass destruction, destroying all stored atomic bombs, and ceasing the manufacture of atomic bombs; it is suggested to conclude an agreement to immediately stop any atomic and hydrogen weapon tests.

　　2. Major powers should reduce their armed forces. The Soviet Union accepts the figure of 2.5 million now proposed by the West as the first step. The second step is to reduce the armed forces of the United States, the People's Republic of China, and the Soviet Union to 1 million to 1.5 million, and the United Kingdom and France to 650,000. It is suggested that the armaments and military expenses of all these countries be reduced accordingly.

　　3. Establish effective supervision of the prohibition of atomic weapons, the reduction of armaments, and the reduction of armed forces. Establish a practical and effective supervision that requires a thorough inspection of how a country is fulfilling its disarmament obligations.

　　4. The Soviet government once again calls on all countries to adopt the draft "Declaration of States on Strengthening World Peace and Security" proposed by the Soviet Union. Before atomic weapons and hydrogen weapons are completely banned, production is stopped, and these two types of weapons are eliminated from armaments, all countries should not use such weapons, and should not use force or the threat of force.

　　Gromyko finally said that the broad masses of people already have enough experience to identify what is diplomatic trickery surrounding the disarmament issue and what is the real solution to this pressing problem. Now is the time to stop the war of words and to actually engage in disarmament. Let us use concrete facts to show that we are realizing the will of the people of all countries who yearn for peace, peaceful labor, and a tranquil life without worrying about tomorrow.

　　Subsequently, representatives of some countries expressed their opinions on Gromyko's speech.

　　US representative Lodge denied that the position taken by the United States in the past and present on the issue of stopping the expansion of armaments has any contradictions. He also groundlessly denied that some people in the United States hope to continue expanding armaments. Lodge reserved the right to comment again on the Soviet representative's speech.

　　British representative Nutting defended the Baghdad Pact. Nutting also said that there are "encouraging factors" in Gromyko's speech, but he is prepared to comment on these points after studying the full text of the Soviet representative's speech in more detail.

　　The opinion put forward by French representative Moch shows that Western countries are already looking for a way out and want to abandon their previous proposal for the level to which the armed forces of all countries should be reduced. Moch said that the level of armed forces proposed by the United States, which the Soviet government has just agreed to, can only be accepted by the West if measures to stop the expansion of atomic weapons are taken at the same time. However, as everyone knows, the representatives of Western countries have firmly opposed the Soviet Union's proposal for a complete ban on atomic weapons, and their excuse is that eliminating atomic weapons seems impossible.

　　Soviet representative Gromyko spoke again, refuting US representative Lodge's speech and pointing out that his speech was irrelevant.

　　Indian representative to the United Nations Menon stated the Indian government's views on the issue of stopping the expansion of armaments and stopping nuclear weapon tests at the afternoon meeting.

　　French representative Moch opposed the suggestion regarding the cessation of experimental explosions of nuclear weapons.

    在联合国裁军委员会会议上
    苏联再次提出解决裁军问题的建议
    接受西方国家第二次提出的大国部队裁减后的水平作为裁军第一个步骤
    新华社14日讯　据塔斯社纽约十三日讯：在联合国裁军委员会七月十二日的会议上，苏联代表葛罗米柯声明，为了打开裁军问题上的僵局，他代表苏联政府宣布苏联愿意接受西方国家第二次提出的大国武装部队裁减后的水平，作为解决裁军问题的第一步，并且准备签订相应的协定。
    这个水平是：苏联、美国、中国各二百五十万人，比西方国家第一次提出并且已经为苏联接受的水平多一百万人；英国和法国各七十五万人，比同样为西方国家第一次提出的水平多十万人。
    葛罗米柯在发言里指出，裁军问题十多年谈判不仅使问题没有接近解决，反而离开实际解决更远了。他指出所以如此，是因为西方大国在整个裁军问题上、特别是在禁止核子武器和大国武装部队水平问题上，采取了反复无常的态度。
    为了使裁军问题的解决有所进展，他受权声明苏联愿意接受西方国家第二次提出的大国武装部队水平，虽然苏联希望更大规模地裁减武装部队。
    葛罗米柯重申苏联关于裁军的监督计划，并且指出西方关于空中摄影的建议是跟裁减军备毫无关系的。他指出，在这方面，法国代表莫克的谈话值得注意，他曾表示过怀疑空中摄影方法的价值。
    葛罗米柯指出，在解决使国际关系复杂化的许多重要政治问题方面已经取得的某些成就，使得现在可以着手实际解决裁军问题。他接着叙述了苏联和人民民主国家在裁军方面采取的一些主动措施，并且驳斥了西方国家统治集团为了力求缩小这些措施的巨大意义而提出的各种荒唐论点。
    葛罗米柯说，苏联认为，目前的国际形势使各国可以在就裁减军备问题达成国际协议之前单方面地实行裁减军备和武装部队的具体措施。这样作将有助于进一步缓和国际紧张局势、巩固国家之间的信任，而这又将为解决重要的国际政治问题和执行全面裁军计划创造更为有利的条件。他表示苏联将真诚地欢迎其他国家为达到这种目的所采取的步骤。
    他说，苏联为了达成裁军协议而进行的耐心的始终如一的努力已经消除了西方反对苏联建议的大部分借口。现在又有人说，不先解决国际争执问题，就不能解决裁军问题。他指出，把这两件完全不同的问题，扯在一起，只是没有必要地使得裁军和解决悬而未决的政治问题两件事情都难办起来。
    葛罗米柯重申，苏联始终主张解决迫切的政治问题，主张建立各国之间必要的信任，互相谅解和合作，从而使各国间关系的正常化得到实现。他引证具体事实说明，目前国际关系中的重要问题到现在还未解决，应该由西方国家里那些不愿意裁军的集团负责。
    葛罗米柯接着分析了悬而未决的国际问题。他在谈到德国问题时重申通过德意志民主共和国和德意志联邦共和国的直接接触来实现德国重新统一的主张。
    在谈到远东问题的时候，葛罗米柯指出，远东最迫切的问题就是给予中华人民共和国在联合国中的合法权利的问题。他说，有六亿人口的中华人民共和国是一个大国；它在国际上的杰出的作用是各国人民都承认的；许多国家都同中国建立了正常的关系。阻挠中华人民共和国代表在联合国中取得它的合法席位，只会破坏这个组织的威信，损害和平事业。
    葛罗米柯说妨碍这项早就成熟了的国际问题的解决的原因只有一个，就是美国统治集团七年来一直在执拗地企图硬要全世界相信，拥有六亿人口的人民民主中国并不存在，似乎中国就是那躲在美军占领下的台湾岛上的破了产的蒋介石集团。
    葛罗米柯还谈到越南问题、东南亚侵略集团、朝鲜问题和中近东紧张局势问题。
    葛罗米柯说，在争执的国际问题没有解决以前似乎不可能解决裁军问题这一论据，是完全人为的，牵强附会的。西方国家现在把这些问题同裁军问题联系起来的目的，只是要制造新的障碍以及破坏裁军，阻挠国际争执问题的解决。
    他说，实际解决裁军问题的出路在于，立即采取可以导致裁减武装力量和军备、导致禁止原子武器的具体措施。苏联提出了自己的建议，苏联深信自己的建议可以成为这种具体措施的基础。
    葛罗米柯接着提出了建议：
    一、大国应该郑重保证不使用原子武器和氢武器，无条件禁止原子武器和氢武器；建议缔结一项禁止大规模毁灭性武器、销毁所有储存的原子弹和停止制造原子弹的协定；建议缔结一项立即停止任何原子武器和氢武器试验的协定。
    二、大国裁减武装部队。苏联接受西方现在提出的数字二百五十万人作为第一步骤。第二步是把美国、中华人民共和国、苏联的武装部队裁减到一百万至一百五十万人，英国和法国裁减到六十五万人。建议所有这些国家的军备和军事费用作相应的裁减。
    三、对禁止原子武器、裁减军备和武装部队建立有效的监督。建立一种实际有效的监督，要求能够认真地检查某一个国家执行裁军义务的情况如何。
    四、苏联政府再一次号召一切国家采纳苏联提出的“各国关于巩固世界和平和安全的宣言”草案，在完全禁止原子武器和氢武器、停止生产和从军备中取消这两种武器以前，各国就应当不使用这种武器，并且不使用武力或者武力威胁。
    葛罗米柯最后说，广大的人民群众已经有足够的经验来识别什么是环绕着裁军问题的外交花招，什么是这一迫切问题的真正解决。现在是停止舌战的时候了，是实际从事裁军的时候了。让我们用具体事实来表示，我们正在实现一切国家的热望和平、和平劳动和不为明天担忧的宁静生活的人民的意志。
    随后，一些国家的代表就葛罗米柯的发言发表了意见。
    美国代表洛奇否认美国以前和现在对停止扩充军备的问题所采取的立场有矛盾的地方。他还没有根据地否认美国有人希望继续扩充军备。洛奇保留权利再次就苏联代表的发言发表意见。
    英国代表纳丁为巴格达条约进行辩护。纳丁又说，在葛罗米柯的发言里有“令人鼓舞的因素”，不过，他准备在更加详细地研究苏联代表的发言全文以后再就这几点发表意见。
    法国代表莫克提出的意见表明，西方国家已经在找退路，想抛弃它们以前提出的各国武装部队应该裁减到的水平的建议。莫克说，苏联政府刚才同意的、美国建议的武装部队水平，只有在同时采取停止扩充原子武器措施的情况下，才能为西方接受。可是，大家知道，西方国家的代表曾坚决地反对苏联提出的关于完全禁止原子武器的建议，他们的借口是，取消原子武器似乎是不可能的。
    苏联代表葛罗米柯再次发言，驳斥美国代表洛奇的发言，指出他的发言文不对题。
    印度驻联合国代表梅农在下午会议上陈述了印度政府对停止扩充军备和停止核子武器试验问题的观点。
    法国代表莫克反对关于停止试验性爆炸核子武器的建议。
