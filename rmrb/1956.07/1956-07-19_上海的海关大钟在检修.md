Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai. The large clock on the Shanghai Customs House building on the Bund along the Huangpu River began its first major overhaul in thirty years on the 11th.

The Shanghai Customs House Clock was built in 1927, simultaneously with the Customs House building. This large clock is one of the most famous clocks in the world, its height occupying a space equivalent to eight stories. The clock has four faces, each with a diameter of more than sixteen feet, equipped with seventy-two automatically switched lights. At night, it radiates light, and the huge numerals are clearly visible from four or five miles away. The moving bronze hands on the clock face are each more than ten feet long and weigh nearly a hundred pounds. Inside the clock are three heavy pendulums, the largest of which weighs two tons. Every hour, a 270-pound hammer strikes the more than ten-ton bell, emitting a majestic "dong, dong" sound. Inside the clock, there are also four small bells that play a melodious tune every fifteen minutes.

    上海的海关大钟在检修
    据新华社上海讯　上海黄浦江外滩海关大厦上的大时钟，从十一日起开始进行三十年来的第一次大检修。
    上海海关大钟是1927年和海关大楼的建筑物同时建成的，这个大钟是世界著名的大钟之一，它从上到下所占的空间相当于八层楼的高度。钟的四周有四个直径一丈六尺多的钟面，装着七十二个自动开关的电灯，一到夜晚，光芒四射，斗大的数码，四五里路以外也看得非常清晰。钟面上移动着的紫铜长针，每根有一丈多长，近一百斤重。大钟的内部有三个笨重的钟摆，最大的一个重达二吨。每到一小时，一个二百七十斤重的大锤，就会敲响十多吨重的大钟铃，发出雄壮的当当声。钟内还有四个小钟铃，每隔十五分钟就会弹出一次悠扬的乐曲。
