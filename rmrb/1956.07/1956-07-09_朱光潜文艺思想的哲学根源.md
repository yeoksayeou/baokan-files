Editor's Note: The study of aesthetics is still very underdeveloped in our country's literary and artistic circles and academic circles. We are publishing Mr. He Lin's article here in the hope of arousing interest in in-depth research on this issue in literary, artistic, and academic circles. Some of the basic issues touched upon in this article, such as the relationship between image thinking and logical thinking, and the relationship between art and science, still require further discussion. This article is a criticism of Mr. Zhu Guangqian's past aesthetic views; Mr. Zhu Guangqian published an article in the "Literary Gazette" on June 30th entitled "The Reactionary Nature of My Literary and Artistic Thought," in which he made an earnest criticism of his past idealist aesthetic thoughts. Readers are encouraged to refer to it.

Mr. Zhu Guangqian's literary and artistic thought once had a wide-ranging influence, penetrating deeply into middle school students and affecting the lives and behaviors of many young people. This is because when he talked about aesthetics, he combined it with philosophy, outlook on life, and youth cultivation. He used a "refined and popular appreciation," "integration of Chinese and Western" style, and engaged in heart-to-heart talks with young people in order to combat progressive literary and artistic theories.

Zhu Guangqian said in the author's confession of "Literary Psychology": "Because I like philosophy, I was forced to study the works of Kant, Hegel, and Croce who discussed aesthetics." We believe that he read Kant and Hegel through Croce's eyes. He never conducted independent research, introduction, or evaluation of Kant and Hegel. Therefore, we still affirm Croce as the main philosophical root of Zhu Guangqian's literary and artistic thought, but in order to more deeply understand and criticize Croce and Zhu Guangqian's aesthetic thought, we also touch upon Kant and Hegel.

The Croce introduced and promoted by Zhu Guangqian should be classified under the banner of the neo-Hegelian idealism in terms of philosophical inheritance. Generally speaking, neo-Hegelians have several common characteristics: (1) In terms of method, they abandoned the rational kernel in Hegel's dialectics and tended towards formalism and metaphysics. (2) In terms of viewpoint, they developed the idealistic and mystical aspects of Hegel's system, retreated to Kant, and transformed into subjective idealism. (3) In terms of political stance, they served the reactionary bourgeoisie and opposed dialectical materialism and historical materialism.

We cannot make a comprehensive criticism of Croce as a neo-Hegelian here. We are limited to criticizing those arguments that Zhu Guangqian introduced with an appreciative and approving attitude, that is, those parts that Zhu Guangqian himself admitted he "followed Croce."

(I) Criticism of Croce's Anti-Dialectical Thought

Croce's abandonment of Hegel's dialectical metaphysical thought is fully manifested in his book "What is Living and What is Dead in Hegel's Philosophy." In this book, he only recognizes Hegel's so-called "identity of opposites" as the living thing in Hegel's philosophy, and denies the "identity of different things," believing that there is no contradiction between different things, and there is no such thing as the unity of contradiction. In this way, he fundamentally denies the universality of contradiction.

When introducing Croce's philosophy, Zhu Guangqian also first emphasized his anti-dialectical thought. He said: "Croce's most important criticism of Hegel lies in the confusion between 'opposites' and 'different things.' He believes that many of Hegel's errors stem from this confusion." (Zhu Guangqian: "A Review of Croce's Philosophy," hereinafter referred to as "Review," published by Zhengzhong Bookstore.)

According to Croce, pure being and pure nothingness are opposites, and their unity is change; similarly, pure beauty and pure ugliness are opposites, and their unity is beauty. In addition, the relationship between truth and falsehood, good and evil are all like this. He believes that only among these kinds of opposites does contradiction exist, and their unity or identity is the concrete universal. As for art and philosophy, economy and morality, or intuition and concept, they can only be said to be different things. Different things each become independent fields, and there is no conflict or contradiction between them. However, these juxtaposed different things without contradiction are said to have stages of development. Zhu Guangqian explained: "Croce regards mental activity as four stages that gradually unfold layer by layer. The starting point is intuition, intuition gives rise to concept, combining into two degrees of knowing; knowing gives rise to action, and action also has two degrees, economic activity gives rise to moral activity. Each of these four stages has its purpose and value, which are beauty, truth, benefit, and good. These four concepts are different from each other rather than opposite." (Ibid.) The "birth" or "unfolding" without contradiction and struggle mentioned here is certainly not the dialectical development of contradiction. According to Croce, there is no opposition or contradiction between intuition and concept, between knowing and acting, and of course there is no internal connection. It is even more impossible to talk about any contradictory development. But it is strange that concept can be born from intuition, and action can be born from knowing. This is obviously just metaphysical patchwork. Where is there any dialectical movement?

It must be pointed out that Croce's view that "beauty is the unity of pure beauty and pure ugliness" is a meaningless statement and an erroneous transport of Hegel's formula of being, nothingness, and change (becoming) to talk about beauty. Because beauty is a concept that is highly rich in content and highly developed in cognition, it is by no means an empty and abstract unity of pure ugliness and pure beauty. On the contrary, we should say that the reason why beauty is a concrete universal is because it is a concrete organic unity of form and content, general and individual, image and concept, truth, goodness, benefit, and so on. When Croce said: "Beauty has no difference in degree, the so-called more beautiful beauty... is inconceivable. Ugliness is different, it has differences in degree, from quite ugly to extremely ugly," (Ibid.) we see that he has metaphysically separated beauty and ugliness, fundamentally denied that beauty has a process of development, and the dialectical relationship between beauty and ugliness.

Croce's metaphysical view that there is no contradiction between different things, nor unity of contradiction, is something that anyone who has studied Comrade Mao Zedong's "On Contradiction," which speaks of the "principle of the universality of contradiction," that is, "every difference in the world already contains contradiction, difference is contradiction," can easily see Croce's absurd anti-dialectical thought. Because "difference is contradiction," there is contradiction between any different things. We can dialectically analyze this contradiction. Croce metaphysically believes that there is no contradiction between different things, and of course he does not understand the dialectical method of concrete analysis of contradictions.

Moreover, Croce's view that there is no contradiction between knowing and acting, and intuition and concept, when applied to society, will of course recognize that unreasonable systems can coexist without conflict. In his view, peasants and landlords, workers and capitalists are only different things, and there is no class contradiction. In this way, he will of course oppose the theory of class struggle. Combined with politics, his "no-conflict theory," which holds that there is no contradiction between different things, is inseparable from his reactionary bourgeois liberal political views. No wonder that in his reactionary book "History of Europe in the Nineteenth Century," which openly opposes communism, he calls communism "the mortal enemy of liberalism" and falsely accuses "communism of suffocating all thought, religion, and art." (Croce: "History of Europe in the Nineteenth Century," 1953 English translation)

The metaphysical essence and political reactionary essence of Croce's theory of "breaking" Hegel, which Zhu Guangqian emphasized and introduced, are just like this.

Croce's anti-dialectical and anti-contradictory development metaphysical viewpoint, expressed in terms of aesthetics, is either the metaphysical separation and creation of gulfs between aesthetic concepts with inherent connections, or the formal equalization and easy equation of different aesthetic concepts, and the failure to obtain the contradictory unity between the two. On the one hand, he metaphysically divides art and morality, art (intuition) and science (concept), art and life interests, and rigidly separates them, thus falling into the error of abstract, isolated, and detached-from-life art for art's sake; on the other hand, he formally cannot see the contradictions, differences, and unity of opposites between art, intuition, creation, expression and other concepts, and indiscriminately equates them, thus falling into formalistic, subjective idealist, and mystical aesthetic thoughts.

(II) Criticism of the Theory of Art as Intuition

Croce's central idea in aesthetics that Zhu Guangqian introduced and promoted is nothing more than the following three equations: First, art is intuition; second, intuition is creation; and third, intuition is expression.

Let us first examine and criticize Croce and Zhu Guangqian's saying that "art is intuition." There is a serious conceptual confusion in Croce's theory of intuition. He divides intuition (including artistic intuition) within the scope of understanding, considering it to be the basis of scientific
 concepts and truth, belonging to the lowest level in terms of understanding. He said, "Art is intuition, is the basic-level activity of understanding, preceding conceptual activity and practical activity" ("Review"). Here he fundamentally confuses the difference between intuition (called "intuition" by Kant) that provides perceptual material for scientific knowledge and artistic intuition. Sensory intuition is indeed the basis of concepts, as the saying goes, "concepts without intuition are blind." But artistic intuition, according to Croce, already has emotional components, which he calls "lyrical expression," and also has the function of imagination, "emotions and images blend into a complete whole," which shows that it is no longer pure sensory intuition that is lower than concepts, and it is not pure activity of understanding. On the one hand, Zhu Guangqian explained Croce by saying: "Intuition is the simplest activity of knowing, coming before perception and concept." On the other hand, he said: "Reason is mixed with images in art," but he could not say how intuition, which is before perception and concept, can understand the reason mixed with images. Zhu Guangqian also admitted that "before intuition, famous rational thinking can help understand the meaning of the work and help arouse intuition" ("Review"). In this way, the thinking of the concept of famous reason that precedes intuition can also help arouse the activity of intuition, which is tantamount to denying the initial definition of "intuition precedes concept" and "intuition gives rise to concept." This confusion has not been clarified in Zhu Guangqian's works. Generally speaking, the theory that "art is intuition" contains the following three errors: The first lies in confusing the sensory intuition that provides scientific knowledge with artistic intuition. The second lies in metaphysically dividing art and science, dividing intuition and concept. After the division, he wanted to force a fit. Third, the fundamental error of the theory that art is intuition lies in classifying art within the scope of perceptual knowledge. Art should be "image thinking," how can it be unrelated to rational knowledge? Art should be something with a high degree of generalization and a high degree of ideality. As Belinsky said, "Thought is the real content of all poetry." Also, as Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out: "The life reflected in literary and artistic works can and should be higher, stronger, more concentrated, more typical, and more ideal than ordinary actual life, and therefore more universal" ("Selected Works of Mao Zedong," Volume III, page 883). Croce and Zhu Guangqian equate art with pure sensory intuition that can only recognize individual images before perception and concept. In this way, they obliterate the rational components of image thinking, typicality, ideality, and universality that art possesses. This will degrade art into something without ideological, anti-rational, ignorant, and mysterious things.

(III) Criticism of the Theory of Intuition as Creation

Looking again at Croce's formula "intuition is creation," which Zhu Guangqian accepted and developed. The theory that intuition is creation is obviously a subjective idealist theory that is fundamentally contrary to the materialist theory of reflection. Zhu Guangqian said: "The knowledge of the image of individual things is intuition... This intuition is not passive feeling, but active creation." ("Review") He clearly stated that intuition is not knowledge of individual things that reflects objective existence (here he distorts the reflection of objective reality into "passive feeling"), but a kind of subjective creation. This kind of intuition of the image of individual things based on subjective creation, of course, cannot become the basis of scientific knowledge. He also said that "intuition is suddenly seeing an image or image in the heart, which is actually creation, and the image is the artistic creation. Therefore, we say that aesthetic experience is the intuition of the image, which is equivalent to saying that it is the creation of art."

It must be admitted that art is the result of creation, and even the result of genius creation. But creation is not unconditional, does not fail to reflect objective reality, and is not subjectively arbitrary and willful. Using the beautiful name of "creation" to smuggle extremely absurd subjective idealism and oppose the theory of reflection will only encourage arrogant subjective fantasy and desecrate the dignity of creation. The "creation" mentioned by Croce and Zhu Guangqian first emphasizes the subjective randomness of the individual, obliterates all objective standards, commonality, typicality, etc., and becomes pure subjective relativism. Zhu Guangqian said, "The image is a reflection of the viewer's character and interest. The viewer's character and interest differ from person to person, time to time, and place to place. The image obtained by intuition also varies accordingly. For example, an ancient pine tree grows in the garden... The ancient pine tree I see in my eyes is different from the ancient pine tree you see in your eyes, and it is different from the ancient pine tree another person sees." Building artistic creation on the basis of the personal subjective character and interest that varies from time to time and place to place is to build artistic creation on the sand of subjective idealism. In other words, only knowing to find the basis for artistic creation in the individuality and particularity of the image and the relativity of the viewer's subjective interest, and not knowing to seek creation from the artist's imaged and faithful reflection of objective reality, in-depth reflection of the typical phenomenon of the unity of individual and general, this is just a chaotic performance of the individual's subjective interest and character. What artistic creation is there?

Similarly, Croce himself said: "The distinction between reality and unreality is irrelevant to the truth of intuition, and is a secondary level... Infants have difficulty distinguishing between truth and falsehood, history and fables, and these have no difference for them. This fact can make us roughly understand the pure and simple state of mind of intuition." (Croce: "Principles of Aesthetics," translated by Zhu Guangqian, published by Zhengzhong Bookstore) The meaning here is that because intuition is creative, in intuition, like infants, it is impossible to distinguish between truth and falsehood, history and fables, facts and fantasies, reality and unreality. Since there is no distinction between truth, falsehood, emptiness, and reality, and everything is without standards, where is the distinction between beauty and ugliness? What is the meaning of artistic creation of this nature? "People are born poets," "Art is a primitive and universal activity that everyone must have, a person is an artist" ("Review"), does not need to reflect reality, does not go through arduous training and learning, everyone is born an artist. Like this vulgarization of art and artistic creation, in addition to teaching people to be lazy and indulgent, despise long-term and arduous artistic cultivation, and be arrogant and self-righteous, everyone can boast of being a genius artist (like the Wang Yangming school advocates that there are saints all over the street), what is the meaning of being loyal to art and treating creation seriously? This reveals that Croce and Zhu Guangqian's saying that "art is intuition" and "intuition is creation" is an extremely decadent mysticism and subjective idealism.

(IV) Criticism of the Theory of Intuition as Expression

Croce's mystical and subjective idealist thought is particularly expressed in his formula "intuition is expression." Croce said: "In this process of knowing, intuition and expression are inseparable. When this appears, the other appears at the same time, because they are not two things but one" ("Review"). According to Zhu Guangqian's explanation of this formula, taking the example of "having bamboo in the chest," "When you intuitively or imagine a bamboo of a certain shape and color, you have already expressed it at the same time. The bamboo in your mind is the bamboo in your painting. The bamboo in the painting only leaves traces of the bamboo in your mind that has already been expressed, it is not expressing the bamboo in your mind." This is tantamount to one-sidedly emphasizing subjective intuition, using intuition to obliterate and annex expression. The bamboo in the mind that is purely subjective is already expression, already art, and the bamboo that is painted is only leaving traces of the bamboo in the mind that has already been expressed. That is to say, "the achievement of an artwork is entirely in the author's mind, it is entirely a mental activity." The paintings that are painted, the poems that are written or printed, "are mistakenly called 'artworks,' but they are only a kind of 'memorandum'" ("Review"). He actually got the absurd view that recognizing poetry and painting as artworks is wrong, which violates common sense. He also said: "Intuition (that is, expression) is entirely the activity of the mind. Art exists in the activity of creation and appreciation of the creator and appreciator, not in the words or other symbols that are communicated. Symbols are material facts, and cannot be called poems or artworks" ("Review"). Wanting to break away from the material media, symbols, words, and artworks that embody and express beauty, and seeking art and artistic creation in subjective intuition, is a typical subjective idealist thought of seeking the mind away from things, seeking the inner away from the outer, and seeking meaning away from words. This view does not combine intuition and expression. In fact, it values intuition and despises expression. It values inner mental activity and despises external artistic creation. If a person subjectively claims to have intuitive activity, he can proudly say that he has artistic expression, but he despises the artworks that others have written and painted as "memorandums" and leftover "traces." This is valuing the inner and despising the outer, and is not a dialectical view of internal and external consistency and the unity of form and content. The objective idealist Hegel's view of the dialectic of internal and external consistency can be borrowed to criticize Croce's "intuition is expression." Hegel said: "Those who are self-conscious of their inner transcendence and falsely boast can cite a famous saying from the Gospels to refute him: 'You must know a person from the fruit of his actions.' ... A mediocre painter or a clumsy poet vainly comforts himself by exaggerating that his heart is filled with noble ideals. Such comfort is vain and meaningless." Croce's thought that intuition itself is expression is inseparable from the pure motive in moral theory (Hegel: "Small Logic," published by Sanlian Bookstore): The pure motive says that good will and pure motive itself are virtue, "moving a thought is acting," and at the same time, many people with great achievements in history are severely criticized subjectively for their impure motives, and their progressive significance and moral value are fundamentally denied. In this way, all his own evil deeds are forgiven by intuitively having a good will "its heart has no other," and the motives of others' achievements are often suspected and added with profound and Zhou-nei articles. This kind of thinking is most likely to strike at the enthusiasm of others' work and develop one's own habits of laziness and pride. This is obviously hindering social progress. Zhu Guangqian, in his "Literary Psychology," after sympathetically introducing Croce's theory of "intuition is expression," also felt that it was impossible to justify the teacher, and reluctantly made some criticisms. However, he could neither criticize its mystical subjective idealist essence, nor, on the basis of accepting Croce's fundamental principle that "art is intuition" and on the premise of admitting that "artistic intuition can be called expression," make some superficial criticisms of "intuition is expression." How can this be considered criticism? It is only, as he himself said, "a question for the teacher" and to make some repairs on his behalf.

The above is only to reveal the mystical and subjective idealist essence of Croce's intuition theory from the perspective of art theory. Zhu Guangqian also developed Croce's intuition theory from the perspective of epistemology and clearly pointed out that "Croce's intuition theory is the cornerstone of idealism." ("Review") Zhu Guangqian boasted about how Croce thoroughly solved the problem of the opposition between the subject and the object since Kant and Hegel with the intuition theory: "The 'thing' was originally created by the knowledge subject with sensory impressions... This is equivalent to saying that the object is the objectification of the knowledge subject... Intuition creates the image, which eliminates the need for the existence of external things" ("Review"). This theory of arbitrarily creating images or images with intuition to eliminate the existence of external things is subjective idealism.

On the basis of canceling the existence of external things, we further cancel nature and natural beauty. "Natural beauty is a self-contradictory term. Nature is material, passive, chaotic, and disorderly, while beauty is the characteristic of art, and must be the result of intuition or expression... The beauty we see, whether in art or nature, is created by us." (Croce: "Aesthetics," English translation) Just like Berkeley, natural things, whether primary or secondary, all their characteristics are the result of perception, without perception, there is no nature. Croce believes that there is no such thing as beauty in nature, the beauty of nature is created by intuition, and nature itself is also created by intuition. This is naked Berkeley-style subjective idealism that cancels the existence of external things and nature in epistemology and denies natural beauty in literary and artistic theory. Literature and art do not reflect objective reality; all existence, nature, and natural beauty are the result of subjective intuition creation; the only source of literary and artistic creation is the individual's intuition or image intuition based on special character and emotion at that time and place. Can't see a little bit of commonality, universality, and objectivity. This is obviously an extremely anti-realist literary and artistic theory.

(V) Criticism of the Empathy Theory

Zhu Guangqian not only inherited and promoted Croce's theory of intuition, but also gave it new connections and development. Croce himself does not agree with the empathy theory. He accuses the empathy theory of "depriving art of all its own value and treating it as only a reflection of moral (or self) value." It must be said that Zhu Guangqian's "new contribution" to reactionary idealist literary and artistic theory is to combine Croce's theory of intuition with Lipps' theory of empathy.

When talking about Croce's intuition, Zhu Guangqian has clearly said that "the object is the objectification of the knowledge subject." This is tantamount to saying from the perspective of epistemology that external things and objects are only the objectification or external projection of the knowledge subject, and fundamentally denies an independently existing external thing and the subject's reflection of the external thing. He immediately used this idealist view to talk about empathy, saying that "empathy is only a kind of external projection," and said, "Poets and artists often regard what is in me as what is in things when they look at the world. As a result, dead things are vitalized, and inanimate things are emotionalized." This explains empathy as the act of the knowing subject objectifying itself. All poets and artists are seen as never reflecting the outside world, but only constantly projecting themselves and objectifying themselves, transferring their subjective emotions to external things and lending them to external things in order to "give the ego a chance to stretch freely." Because there is no common objective world at all, "everyone's world is formed by the self-stretching of each person." Since empathy can allow the self to stretch freely and is the essence of aesthetic or artistic experience, art becomes a tool for the self to stretch freely, and the realm of art becomes a place for arrogant careerists like the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group to emphasize "subjective fighting spirit" and "self-expansion" to stretch themselves. This kind of anti-realist subjective idealist aesthetic theory can of course gain a best-selling market among bourgeois individualists or liberals.

Zhu Guangqian also connects empathy with Bishop Berkeley's subjective idealism. He said: "When we perceive external things, we often project the feelings we get onto the things themselves and mistakenly regard them as the inherent attributes of the things. Thus, what was originally in me becomes in things. For example, when we say 'the flower is red,' we regard red as an inherent attribute of the flower, as if it is thought that even if no one perceives it, it is still there. In fact, the flower itself only has the possibility of making people feel red, and red is the result of vision... Strictly speaking, we can only say 'I think the flower is red.' We usually omit the three words 'I think' and directly say 'the flower is red.' Then my feeling is mistakenly regarded as the attribute of the thing" ("Talking About Beauty"). Recognizing that the attributes of things are only my feelings, or the external projection of my feelings, as if any thing will lose its inherent attributes as long as no one perceives it. This is completely Berkeley's philosophy. Thus, empathy is not only a psychological theory, nor is it only an aesthetic theory, but it has a Berkeleyian epistemology as its basis. In fact, according to the theory of reflection, it is not "I think the flower is red," but the flower itself has the color red, and I am just reflecting or copying the red color of the flower. It is not "mistakenly recognizing" my feeling as the attribute of the thing, but the attribute of the thing constitutes the content of my feeling. And we must know that "without the reflected, reflection does not exist, but the reflected exists independently of the reflector." (Lenin: "Materialism and Empirio-criticism," People's Publishing House, page 94)

On the one hand, Zhu Guangqian connects Lipps's theory of empathy with Croce's image intuition, and on the other hand, he connects it with Berkeley's epistemology. Therefore, he further clearly said: "Empathy is called 'anthropomorphism' by some people. Taking me as the standard for measuring people and people as the standard for measuring things, all knowledge and experience can be said to be obtained in this way." This is blatantly advocating subjectivism and egoism. Knowledge, experience, nature, and art all start from the subject and take the self as the standard. However, I don't know that this kind of subjective idealism has already dug the foundation of knowledge, experience, nature, and art. Where can we find the standards of right and wrong, truth and falsehood, beauty and ugliness, existence and non-existence?

Zhu Guangqian himself also admits that "from the intellectual point of view, empathy is an illusion and a superstition." "It has some mystical colors." That is to say, it is anti-scientific, but he immediately affirms the "great" significance of empathy: "But without it (empathy), the world would be like a stubborn stone, people would only be a set of dead machines, life would have no so-called interest. Not only is it difficult for art to be produced, but religion would also be unable to appear. Most poets, artists, and fanatical religious believers rely on empathy to create a soul for the universe, break the gap between man and nature, and shorten the distance between man and God." We do not object to saying that religion must rely on this kind of illusion, superstition, and empathy with mystical colors, but because we want to oppose religion as the opium of the people, we must also oppose this kind of empathy in which "fanatical religious believers create a soul for the universe." But if, as Zhu Guangqian said, the rich and colorful nature, the meaning and interest of life, and the production of art are all entrusted to this kind of illusion, superstition, and mystical empathy, and the light of science, reason, and rationality cannot be seen, then it would be a pity. Engels taught that when "our representations and concepts of the real world constitute a correct reflection of reality," we obtain "the identity of thinking and being" ("On Feuerbach," People's Publishing House, pages 20, 21), that is, breaking the gap between man and nature. And Zhu Guangqian advocates subjective, mystical, anti-reflection theory, and anti-scientific empathy, which is an illusion in the intellect, which is precisely closing people in subjective emotions, making people see only their own reflections in the object, and not seeing the original face of things. This is really never breaking the gap between man and nature. Is there any other trick to break the gap between oneself and the objective world other than denying subjective one-sidedness and reflecting reality, nature, social life, and the times truthfully and objectively? The content and essence of empathy is nothing more than using subjective fantasy and personal emotions to distort objective reality, beautify and idealize the corrupt, dying, and stubborn things, so that people see that everything that exists is beautiful and reasonable, so that they can intoxicate themselves, paralyze the people, serve the old social system, and play a conservative and reactionary role in politics. Empathy is rendered as transferring my emotions to external things and taking me as the standard for measuring things and measuring people. In fact, the so-called "I" here is the individual's subjective emotions and character at that time and place. Such individual subjective character and emotions are the product of old traditions, habits, times, and society. Without criticism and reflection, relying solely on this subjective thing as a standard for measuring things and measuring people will inevitably lead to the individual's affection for the old, vanity, and self-intoxication being given to fresh things and external things, so that they will never see the fresh and developing things and the objective reality, but only "freely stretch the self" in subjective fantasy. This kind of thinking is the same as Hu Feng's so-called "subjective spirit," "feeling the true subject is running," and "all things are prepared for me." Therefore, empathy is anti-scientific and anti-rational in cognition, and conservative and reactionary in practice, and has harmful consequences for the progress of human society. It must be stated that empathy, as a psychological fact, is that people are prone to fall into the illusion of measuring things by themselves when they recognize the outside world, and we should admit it. Empathy has a certain significance in the creation and appreciation of poetry and plastic arts, and it cannot be ignored. As for exaggerating this illusion of empathy and transforming it into a subjective idealist epistemology, which becomes the source of art and knowledge, it is an extremely reactionary theory that we must resolutely refute.

Here, some people may raise the following question: Since Zhu Guangqian believes that aesthetic feeling is the observation of isolated and insulated forms for no purpose, according to this statement, are not isolated and insulated images the images of independent external objective things, and is not the observation for no purpose the true reflection of objective objects without subjective emotions, interests, and self-prejudice? Empathy is indeed anti-reflection theory, and the theory of image intuition should be in line with the principles of reflection theory. But as mentioned earlier, Croce's theory of image intuition is anti-reflection theory. The key to Zhu Guangqian's ability to combine image intuition and empathy is that the content of both is the identity of the subject and the object, and this identity is built on the subjective idealist basis of the subject's external projection as the object. Zhu Guangqian believes that Lipps's theory of empathy is "very similar to Croce's theory of image intuition," because Lipps repeatedly explains empathy as "the identity of the self and the non-self," and the self that Lipps calls the self is the self of observation, and the so-called non-self is not the object itself but its image. And the image is created by intuition, and the "non-self" has been purified by intuition. Therefore, the intuition of the image is the identity of things and me, and the identity of things and me is the external projection of the self. "I infuse my character into things, and at the same time absorb the attitude of things into me." Where is there the slightest meaning of reflecting external things? In this mystical realm of the unity of things and me, the isolated and insulated image and the self of concentrated observation merge into one. According to Zhu Guangqian, "Entrust the entire mind to that isolated and insulated image. Then I and the thing will become one." We can draw a formula for Zhu Guangqian as follows: Image intuition? Empathy? Unity of things and me? Mystical realm. In other words, according to Zhu Guangqian, aesthetic or artistic experience is a mystical realm, and the mystical realm is the source of art. If the elegant nouns he uses are translated into ordinary language, then his so-called "self of concentrated observation" refers to the detached and free bourgeois literati in semi-feudal and semi-colonial society, and his so-called "isolated and insulated image" refers to the antiques and playthings that bourgeois literati uniquely love and are fond of, such as the solitary secret books that the Hu Shi school loves and other things that leisurely literati like to collect antiques and delve into the horns of learning, things that are detached from social practice. In short, everyone can see that the isolated and insulated image is the opposite of objective reality, social life, the emotions and destiny of the people, and so on. It is not surprising that Zhu Guangqian and those who love Zhu Guangqian's set of literary and artistic ideas went astray from the people and embarked on the road of opposing the people's revolution in the past.

    朱光潜文艺思想的哲学根源
    贺麟
    编者按：关于美学问题的研究在我国文艺界、学术界还很不发展。我们在这里发表贺麟先生的文章，希望引起文艺界、学术界深入研究这一问题的兴趣。本文所接触到的一些基本问题，如形象思维和逻辑思维的关系问题、艺术和科学的关系问题，还需要大家继续讨论。本文是批判朱光潜先生的过去的美学见解的；朱光潜先生在六月三十日出版的“文艺报”上发表了“我的文艺思想的反动性”一文，对他自己过去的唯心主义美学思想作了恳切的批判，希望读者参看。
    朱光潜先生的文艺思想曾经发生过广泛的影响，这影响曾深入到中学生，并且影响到许多青年的生活和行为，因为当他谈美学时，他是结合着哲学、人生观、青年修养来谈的，他是以“雅俗共赏”、“中西合璧”的笔调，用同青年谈心的方式去和进步的文艺理论作斗争。
    朱光潜在“文艺心理学”的作者自白中说：“因为喜欢哲学，我被逼到研究康德、黑格尔和克罗齐诸人讨论美学的著作。”我们认为他是以克罗齐的眼光去阅读康德、黑格尔的，他并不曾对康德和黑格尔作过独立的研究、介绍和评价，因此我们仍肯定克罗齐为朱光潜文艺思想的主要哲学根源，但为了更深入地了解和批评克罗齐、朱光潜的美学思想，也复涉及到康德和黑格尔。
    朱光潜所介绍和宣扬的克罗齐，在哲学的继承方面应归在新黑格尔派的唯心主义旗帜下。而新黑格尔派一般讲来有几个共同的特征：（一）在方法方面丢掉了黑格尔辩证法中的合理内核，趋向于形式主义和形而上学。（二）在观点方面发展了黑格尔体系中的唯心的和神秘的一面，退回到康德，转变成了主观唯心论。（三）在政治立场方面替反动的资产阶级服务，反对辩证唯物论和历史唯物论。
    对于作为一个新黑格尔主义者的克罗齐，我们在这里不能作全面的批判，我们只限于批评朱光潜用欣赏赞许的态度所介绍的那些论点，亦即朱光潜自己承认他“跟着克罗齐走”的那些部分。
    （一）克罗齐的反辩证法思想批判
    克罗齐丢掉了黑格尔的辩证法的形而上学思想，充分表现在他的“什么是黑格尔哲学中活的东西和死的东西”一书中。在这书中他只承认黑格尔所谓“相反者的同一”，认之为黑格尔哲学中的活的东西，而否认“相异者的同一”，认为相异者之间没有矛盾，也无所谓矛盾的统一，这样他便根本否认了矛盾的普遍性。
    朱光潜在介绍克罗齐的哲学时，也首先强调他这种反辩证法的思想。他说：“克罗齐对于黑格尔最重要的批评在‘相反者’与‘相异者’的混淆。他以为黑格尔的许多错误都是从这个混淆起来的”。（朱光潜：“克罗齐哲学述评”，以下简称“述评”，正中书局出版。）
    照克罗齐看来，纯有与纯无是相反者，其统一为变化；同样纯美与纯丑是相反者，其统一为美，此外真与假、善与恶的关系也都是这样。他认为只有这类相反者中间才存在着矛盾，它们的统一或同一，才是具体的共相。至于艺术与哲学，经济与道德，或直觉与概念等便只能说是相异者，相异者各自成为独立的领域，它们之间便没有冲突或矛盾。但是这些没有矛盾的并列着的相异者，据说却有发展的阶段。朱光潜解释说：“克罗齐把心灵活动看成一层高一层逐渐生展底四个阶段，起点是直觉，直觉生概念，合为知的两度；知生行，行也有两度，经济底活动生道德底活动。这四阶段各有它的目的与价值，就是美、真、益、善。这四个概念彼此相异而非相反。”（同前书）这里所讲没有矛盾斗争的“生”或“生展”，当然不是辩证法的矛盾发展。照克罗齐看来，直觉与概念间，知与行间既无对立，也无矛盾，当然也无内在联系，更说不上有什么矛盾发展。但很奇怪，却可由直觉生概念，由知生行。这显然只是形而上学凑合，哪里有什么辩证的运动呢？
    必须指出，克罗齐认为“美是纯美与纯丑的统一”乃是毫无意义的说法、乃是错误地搬运黑格尔论有、无、变化（生成）的格式来谈美。因为美乃是一个在内容上高度丰富、在认识上高度发展的概念，决不是空虚抽象的什么纯丑与纯美的统一体。反之我们应该说，美之所以是具体的共相，乃因为它是形式与内容、一般与个别、形象与概念、真善益等等具体的有机的统一。当克罗齐说：“美没有程度上的差别，所谓较美底美……是不可思议的。丑却不同，有程度上的差别，从颇丑到极丑，”（同前书）时，我们就看见他已经把美与丑形而上学地割裂开、根本否认了美有发展的过程、和美与丑的辩证关系。
    克罗齐认为相异者之间无矛盾、亦无矛盾统一的形而上学观点，凡是研究过毛泽东同志的矛盾论中所讲的“矛盾的普遍性的原理”，即“世界上的每一差异中就已经包含着矛盾，差异就是矛盾”的人，当不难一眼看出克罗齐这种荒谬的反辩证法的思想。因为“差异就是矛盾”，任何相异者之间就存在着矛盾。我们就可以对这个矛盾予以辩证的分析。克罗齐形而上学地认为相异者之间，没有矛盾，当然也就不懂得具体分析矛盾的辩证方法。
    而且克罗齐认为知与行、直觉与概念这些相异者之间没有矛盾的看法，应用到社会上来，当然会承认不合理的制度可以并行不悖。在他看来，农民与地主，工人与资本家也只是相异者，没有阶级的矛盾了。这样他当然要反对阶级斗争的理论了。结合到政治上看，他这种认为相异者无矛盾的“无冲突论”和他的反动资产阶级自由主义的政治见解是分不开的。无怪乎在他的明目张胆地反对共产主义的反动著作“十九世纪欧洲史”一书中，称共产主义为“自由主义的死敌”，并诬蔑“共产主义窒息一切思想、宗教、艺术”。（克罗齐：“十九世纪欧洲史”，1953年英译本）
    朱光潜所强调介绍的克罗齐“破”黑格尔的理论之形而上学实质和政治上的反动实质就是如此。
    克罗齐这种反辩证法，反矛盾发展的形而上学观点表现在美学方面的，不是对于有内在联系的美学概念加以形而上学的割裂、划鸿沟，就是对于相异的美学概念加以形式的等同、轻易划等号，而得不到两者间的矛盾统一。一方面他把艺术与道德、艺术（直觉）与科学（概念）、艺术与生活利益形而上学地划分开、生硬地割裂开，因而陷于抽象的、孤立的、脱离生活的为艺术而艺术的错误；另一方面他又形式地在艺术、直觉、创造、表现等概念间看不出矛盾、区别、对立统一的关系，而胡乱划等号，因而陷于形式主义、主观唯心论、神秘主义的美学思想。
    （二）艺术即直觉说批判
    克罗齐美学上的中心思想为朱光潜所介绍宣扬的不外如下三个划等号的公式：一、艺术即直觉，二、直觉即创造，三、直觉即表现。
    我们先来批判考察一下克罗齐、朱光潜“艺术即直觉”的说法。在克罗齐的直觉说中存在着一个严重的观念的混乱。他把直觉（包括艺术的直觉）划分在知解范围之内，认为是科学上
  的概念、真理的基础，在知解方面属于最低层。他说，“艺术为直觉，是基层底知解活动，先于概念活动与实用活动”（“述评”）。他在这里根本混淆了供给科学知识的感性材料的直觉（康德叫做直观）与艺术上的直觉的差别。感性的直觉诚然是概念的基础，所谓“概念没有直观则盲”。但艺术上的直觉据克罗齐看来已经有情感的成分，他叫做“抒情的表现”，也有想像的作用，“情感和意像交融成一个完整体”，足见它已经不是单纯的低于概念的感性直觉，不是单纯的知解活动。朱光潜一方面解释克罗齐说：“直觉是最单纯的，来在知觉和概念之前的知的活动。”一方面又说：“理在艺术中混化于意像”，但他又说不出，在知觉和概念之前的直觉，如何能认识这混化于意像中的理。朱光潜还承认“直觉之前可有名理底思考帮助了解作品的意义，帮助起直觉”（“述评”）。照这样说，前于直觉的名理的概念的思考还可以帮助引起直觉的活动，这就不啻自己否定了“直觉是先于概念，”“直觉生概念”的最初定义了。这种混乱在朱光潜的著作中迄未得到澄清。总的讲来，“艺术即直觉”说包含有如下三点错误：第一在于把供给科学知识的感性直觉与艺术的直觉混淆起来。第二在于形而上学地把艺术与科学割裂、把直觉与概念割裂，割裂开了之后，又想去勉强凑合。第三，艺术即直觉说的根本错误在于把艺术划归在感性认识范围内。艺术应该是“形象的思维”，怎能与理性认识无关？艺术应该是有高度概括性、高度思想性的东西。诚如别林斯基所说：“思想是一切诗歌的真正内容”。又诚如毛泽东同志所指示：“文艺作品中所反映出来的生活却可以而且应该比普通的实际生活更高、更强烈、更有集中性、更典型、更理想、因此就更带普遍性”（“毛泽东选集”三卷八八三页）。克罗齐、朱光潜把艺术与单纯的、在知觉和概念之前只能认识个别形象的感性直觉等同起来，这样就抹煞了艺术中所具有的形象思维、典型性、理想性、普遍性诸理性成分，这样就会把艺术贬低为没有思想性的、反理性的、蒙昧神秘的东西了。
    （三）直觉即创造说批判
    再看朱光潜所接受并发挥了的克罗齐“直觉即创造”这一个公式。直觉即创造说显然是和唯物论的反映论根本相反的主观唯心论理论。朱光潜说：“个别事物形象的知便是直觉。……这直觉不是被动的感觉，而是主动的创造。”（“述评”）他明言直觉不是反映客观存在的个别事物的知解（这里他把对客观现实的反映曲解为“被动的感觉”），而是一种主观的创造。这种基于主观创造的对个别事物的形象的直觉，当然无法成为科学知识的基础。他又说“直觉是突然间心里见到一个形象或意像，其实就是创造，形象便是创造成的艺术。因此，我们说美感经验是形象的直觉，就无异于说它是艺术的创造。”
    必须承认艺术是创造的成果，甚至是天才创造的成果。但创造不是无条件的，不是不反映客观现实的，也不是主观任意任性的。利用“创造”的美名来偷运极其荒谬的主观唯心论，反对反映论，那就会助长狂妄的主观幻想，亵渎创造的尊严。克罗齐和朱光潜所讲的“创造”首先强调个人的主观随意性，抹煞一切客观标准、共同性、典型性等，而变成了纯粹的主观相对主义。朱光潜说，“形象是观赏者的性格和情趣的反照。观赏者的性格和情趣随人随时随地不同，直觉所得的形象也因而千变万化。比如古松长在园里……我眼中所见到的古松和你眼中所见到的不同，和另一个人所见到的又不同”。把艺术的创造建筑在个人主观的随时随地不同的性格和情趣的基础上面，这就是把艺术创造建筑在主观唯心论的沙滩上。换言之，只知道在形象之个别性、特殊性和与观赏者的主观情趣之相对性里面去为艺术创造找根据，而不知道从艺术家之形象化地忠实地反映客观现实、深入反映那个别与一般统一的典型现象方面去求创造，这只是个人主观情趣、性格的分歧杂乱的表演，那还有什么艺术创造？
    同样克罗齐自己也说：“实在与非实在的分别对于直觉的真相是不相干底、是次一层底。……婴儿难辨真和伪、历史和寓言，这些对于他都无区别，这事实可以使我们约略明白直觉的纯朴心境。”（克罗齐：“美学原理”，朱光潜译，正中书局出版）这里的意思是说，因为直觉是创造的，在直觉中和婴儿一样是分辨不出真和伪、历史和寓言、事实和幻想、实在和非实在的。既然没有真伪虚实的分别，一切都漫无标准了，那里还有什么美丑的分别呢？这样性质的婴儿式的艺术创造，有什么意义呢？“人天生就是诗人”，“艺术是尽人皆必有底原始而普遍的活动，是人就是艺术家”（“述评”），不需要反映现实，不经过艰苦锻炼学习，人人天生就是艺术家，像这样庸俗化艺术和艺术创造，除了教人懒惰放任，轻蔑长期艰苦的艺术修养，狂妄自大，每个人都可自诩为天才艺术家（像王阳明派主张满街都是圣人）外，还有什么忠于艺术、严肃对待创造的意义呢？这正揭露了克罗齐、朱光潜的“艺术即直觉”、“直觉即创造”的说法乃是极其腐朽的神秘主义和主观唯心论思想。
    （四）直觉即表现说批判
    克罗齐这种神秘的、主观唯心论思想特别表现在他“直觉即表现”这一公式上面。克罗齐说：“在这个知底过程中，直觉与表现是无法可分底。此出现则彼同时出现，因为它们本非二物而是一体”（“述评”）。照朱光潜对于这一公式的解释，就“胸有成竹”这一例子说，“当你直觉或想像到某形某色的竹时，你同时便已把它表现了。你的意中之竹便是你的画中之竹。画中之竹只是使已表现的意中之竹留痕迹，并非表现意中之竹”。这无异于片面强调主观的直觉，用直觉去抹煞并吞并表现。那纯粹在主观上的意中之竹已经是表现，已经是艺术，而画出来之竹只不过是业已表现了的意中之竹留下痕迹。这就是说，“艺术作品的成就完全在作者的心里，它完全是一种心灵活动。”画出来的画，写出或印出来的诗，“被人误称为‘艺术品’，其实只是一种‘备忘录’”（“述评”）。他竟得到认诗、画为艺术品乃是错误的这种违反常识的荒谬看法。又说：“直觉（即表现）完全是心灵的活动，艺术存于创造者与欣赏者的创造与欣赏那个活动中，不存于传达出来底文字或其他符号。符号是物质的事实，不能叫做诗或艺术作品，”（“述评”）要想脱离体现美、表达美的物质媒介、符号、文字、艺术作品，在主观直觉中去求艺术和艺术创造，这是离物求心、离外求内、离言求意的典型的主观唯心论思想。这种看法并没有把直觉与表现结合起来，实际上是重直觉、轻表现，重内面的心灵活动，轻表现在外面的艺术创作。假如一个人主观上自命为有了直觉活动，他就可以自豪为有了艺术表现，而对他人业已写出画出的艺术品，则反轻蔑为“备忘录”、为遗留的“痕迹”。这乃是重内轻外，并不是内外一致、形式与内容统一的辩证观点。客观唯心论者黑格尔关于内外一致的辩证法的看法可以借用来批评克罗齐的“直觉即表现”。黑格尔说：“彼自觉其内在的高超而虚憍自诩的人，可举出福音书中一句名言以驳斥他：‘汝须从行为的果实里去认识人’。……一个低能的画家或一个拙劣的诗人徒夸大地以他们内心里充满了高尚的理想自相慰借，则他们这种慰借便是虚妄无谓的。”克罗齐这种认直觉本身即是表现的思想和道德理论上的纯动机（黑格尔：“小逻辑”，三联书店出版）说是不可分的：纯动机说认善良意志、纯动机本身即是德行，“动一个念头即是行”，同时对历史上许多有丰功伟绩的人物，都从主观上严厉斥责其动机不纯，而根本否定其进步意义和道德价值。这样对自己一切罪恶行为则直觉到自己有善良意志“其心无他”而加以宽恕，对别人的功绩则动辄怀疑其动机，而加以深文周内。这种思想最足以打击别人工作的积极性，养成自己懒惰骄傲的习气，这显然是妨害社会进步的。朱光潜在他的“文艺心理学”中于同情地介绍克罗齐“直觉即表现”说之后，也觉得实无法为老师自圆，勉强作了一些批评。不过他既不能批评其神秘主义的主观唯心论实质，又由于在接受克罗齐“艺术即直觉”的根本原则的基础上并且在承认了“艺术底直觉可以称为表现”的前提上，来对“直觉即表现”说，作一些表面支节的批评。这哪里算得批评，只不过如他自己所说，是向老师“聊当质疑”，并代为补缀罢了。
    以上不过是从艺术理论方面去揭露克罗齐直觉说的神秘主义和主观唯心主义的实质。朱光潜还从认识论方面去发挥了克罗齐的直觉说，并明白指出“克罗齐的直觉说是唯心主义的奠基石。”（“述评”）朱光潜吹嘘克罗齐如何凭直觉说彻底解决了康德、黑格尔以来主体与对象对立这个问题道：“‘物’原来只是知识主凭感官印象创造出来的。……这就无异于说，对象是知识主的对象化。……直觉创造了意像，就打消了外物存在的必要”（“述评”）。这种用直觉任意创造的意像或形象来取消外物的存在的理论就是主观唯心论。
    在取消了外物存在的基础上进一步来取消自然和自然美。“自然美是一个自相矛盾的名词。自然是物质底、被动底、混沌杂乱底，而美为艺术的特色，必须是直觉或表现的结果。……我们所见到的美，无论在艺术或自然，都是我们创造出来的。”（克罗齐“美学”，英译本）正如巴克莱那样，自然事物无论初性、次性，其一切特性都是知觉的结果，无知觉即无自然。克罗齐认自然无所谓美，自然的美是直觉创造出来的，同样自然本身也就是直觉创造出来的。这在认识论上取消了外物存在和自然，是赤裸裸的巴克莱式的主观唯心论，在文艺理论方面否认了自然美。文艺不反映客观现实；一切存在、自然、自然美都是主观的直觉创造的结果；文艺创造的唯一源泉只是个人当时当地基于特殊性格，情感的直觉或形象的直觉，看不见一点有共同性、普遍性、客观性的东西。这显然是一种极端反现实主义的文艺理论。
    （五）移情说批判
    朱光潜不仅承继了并宣扬了克罗齐的直觉说，他还进一步予以新的联系和发展。克罗齐本人并不赞同移情说，他斥责移情说“剥夺了艺术自身的一切价值，把它当作仅只是道德（或自我）的价值的反射”。把克罗齐的直觉说与李普斯的移情说结合起来，不能不说是朱光潜对于反动唯心主义文艺理论的“新贡献”。
    朱光潜在谈克罗齐的直觉时，已明白说过“对象是知识主的对象化”，这已无异于从认识论上说，外物、对象不过是认识主体的客观化或外射作用，根本否认一个独立存在的外物和主体对外物的反映。他立刻就根据这种唯心观点来谈移情作用说，“移情作用只是一种外射作用”，并且说，“诗人和艺术家看世界，常把在我的外射为在物的，结果是死物生命化，无情事物的有情化。”这就把移情作用解释成认识主体客观化自己的作用，把所有的诗人、艺术家都看成绝不反映外界，而只是在那里不断地外射自己、对象化自己，把自己主观的情感转移给外物、假借给外物，以便“给自我以自由伸张的机会”。因为根本就没有共同的客观的世界，“各人的世界都由各人的自我伸张而成。”移情作用既然可以让自我自由伸张，既然是美感或艺术经验的本质，那么艺术就成为自我自由伸张的工具了，而艺术的领域也成为像胡风反革命集团那样强调“主观战斗精神”、“自我扩张”的狂妄野心家自我伸张的场所了。这类反现实主义的主观唯心主义的美学理论，当然可以在资产阶级个人主义者或自由主义者当中获得畅销的市场了。
    朱光潜复把移情作用与巴克莱主教的主观唯心论联系起来。他说：“我们知觉外物，常把自己所得的感觉外射到物的本身上去，把它误认为物所固有的属性，于是本来在我的就变成在物的了。比如我们说‘花是红的’时，是把红看作花所固有的属性，好像是以为纵使没有人去知觉它，它也还是在那里。其实花本身只有使人觉得红的可能性，至于红却是视觉的结果。……严格的说，我们只能说‘我觉得花是红的’。我们通常都把‘我觉得’三字略去而直说‘花是红的’，于是我的感觉遂被误认为在物的属性了”（“谈美”）。认事物的属性只是我的感觉，或我的感觉的外射，好像任何事物只要没有人去知觉它，它就会失掉它自己固有的属性似的。这完全是巴克莱主义哲学。于是移情说不仅是心理学上的理论，也不仅是一种美学理论，而有了巴克莱主义认识论作基础了。其实照反映论讲来，不是“我觉得花是红的”而是花本身具有红的颜色，我只是反映，或复写花的红色。不是把我的感觉“误认”为物的属性，而是物的属性构成了我的感觉的内容。并且我们要知道“没有被反映者，反映就不存在，可是被反映者是不依赖于反映者而存在的”。（列宁：“唯物论与经验批判论”，人民出版社，九四页）
    朱光潜一方面把李普斯的移情说和克罗齐的形象的直觉相联系，一方面又把它和巴克莱的认识论相联系，因此他进一步明白地说：“移情作用有人称为‘拟人作用’。拿我做测人的标准，拿人做测物的标准，一切知识经验都可以说是如此得来的”。这是明目张胆地宣传主观主义、唯我主义。知识、经验、自然、艺术一切皆从主观出发，皆以自我为标准。殊不知这种主观唯心论已经挖掉了知识经验、自然和艺术的墙脚，哪里去找是非真伪美丑、存在与不存在的标准呢？
    朱光潜自己也承认，“从理智观点看，移情作用是一种错觉、是一种迷信。”“带有若干神秘主义的色彩”。这就是说，是反科学的，但他立刻肯定移情作用的“伟大”意义道：“但是如果没有它（移情作用），世界便如一块顽石，人也只是一套死机器，人生便无所谓情趣，不特艺术难产生，即宗教亦无由出现了。诗人艺术家和狂热的宗教信徒大半都凭移情作用替宇宙造
  出一个灵魂、把人和自然的隔阂打破，把人和神的距离缩小。”说宗教须仰赖于这种错觉、迷信、有神秘色彩的移情作用，我们不反对，但因为我们要反对作为人民的鸦片烟的宗教，也就得反对这种“狂热的宗教信徒替宇宙造出一个灵魂”的移情作用。但是如果像朱光潜所说那样，要把丰富多采的自然、人生的意义与情趣和艺术的产生都寄托于这种错觉、迷信、神秘的移情作用上面，而看不见科学、理智、理性的光明，那就未免可怜了。恩格斯教导说，当“我们关于现实世界的表象和概念中构成对现实的正确的反映”，我们就获得了“思维与存在的同一”（“费尔巴哈论”，人民出版社，二○、二一页），亦即打破了人和自然的隔阂。而朱光潜提倡主观的、神秘的、在理智看来是错觉的反反映论、反科学的移情作用，这正好把人关闭在主观的情感里，使人在对象中只看见自己的反影，看不见事物的本来面目，这才是真正地永远打不破人和自然的隔阂。难道除否定主观的片面性，如实地客观地反映现实、反映自然、反映社会生活、反映时代外，还有其他的窍门可以打破自己与客观世界的隔阂吗？移情作用的内容实质也不过是用主观的幻想、个人的情绪去歪曲客观现实，把腐朽的垂死的顽固的东西加以美化、理想化，使人见得凡是存在的东西都是美好合理的东西，以自己陶醉自己、麻痹人民，服务于旧的社会制度，在政治上起一种保守和反动的作用罢了。移情作用被渲染成把我的情感转移给外物，拿我来做测物和测人的标准，实际上这里所谓“我”，乃是当时当地的个人的主观情感和性格，而这样的个人的主观的性格和情感乃是旧传统、习惯、时代和社会的产物，不加批判反省，专依靠这种主观的东西来作测物测人的标准，结果必不免以个人思旧之情，妄自尊大和自我陶醉之情赋给新鲜事物和外界事物，因而永远看不见新鲜的发展的东西，看不见客观现实，只是在主观幻想中“自由伸张自我”。这种思想和胡风所谓“主观精神”、“感到了真主观在运行”、“万物皆备于我”是一类的东西。因此移情作用在认识上是反科学的，反理性的，在实践上是保守的、反动的，对人类社会的进步有着危害的后果。必须说明，移情作用作为一个心理事实，即认人们认识外界时常易陷于以己度物的错觉，我们是应当承认的。移情作用在诗歌和造型艺术的创作和鉴赏中有一定的意义，也是不能忽视的。至于把移情作用这种错觉加以夸大转变成主观唯心论的认识论，成为艺术和知识的源泉，乃是极端反动的学说，是我们所要坚决加以驳斥的。
    这里可能有人提出这样一个问题：朱光潜既然认为美感是对于孤立绝缘的形相加以无所为而为地观照，照这个说法，孤立绝缘的形象岂不是独立外在的客观事物的形象，而无所为而为的观照，岂不是无主观情感利益、无自我偏见，如实反映客观对象的形象吗？移情说诚然是反反映论的，而形象的直觉说应该是符合反映论的原则的了。但是前面已经说过，克罗齐的形象的直觉说是反反映论的。朱光潜之所以能够把形象的直觉与移情作用结合起来，关键在于两者的内容都是主体与客体的同一，而这种同一乃是建筑在主体外射为客体的主观唯心论上面。朱光潜认为李普斯的移情说“与克罗齐的形象直觉说很相近”，因为李普斯再三把移情说解释为“自我和非自我的同一”，而李普斯所谓自我即观照的自我，所谓非自我并非物体本身而是它的形象。而形象乃是直觉创造出来的，“非自我”都是经过直觉净化过来的。因此形象的直觉即是物我的同一，而物我的同一即是自我的外射，“我以我的性格灌输到物，同时也把物的姿态吸收于我”，这哪有丝毫反映外物的意味呢？在这种物我一体的神秘境界中孤立绝缘的形象与凝神观照的自我融合为一。照朱光潜所说，“把整个的心灵寄托在那个孤立绝缘的意像上，于是我和物便打成一气了”。我们可以替朱光潜划一道公式如下：形象的直觉?移情作用?物我一体?神秘境界。换言之，照朱光潜看来，美感或艺术的经验即是神秘境界，神秘境界就是艺术的源泉。如果把他所用的高雅的名词翻译成普通话，那么他所谓“凝神观照的自我”就是指半封建半殖民地社会中的脱离人民优游自在的资产阶级士大夫，他所说的“孤立绝缘的形象”，其实际内容就是资产阶级士大夫所独特喜爱和癖好的古董玩意儿之类，如胡适派所喜爱的孤本秘笈以及其他悠闲文人喜欢古玩、喜欢在学术上钻牛角尖等等，脱离社会实践的东西。总之，谁也看得出孤立绝缘的形象正是客观现实、社会生活、人民大众的情感和命运等等的反面。一点也不奇怪何以朱光潜和喜爱朱光潜这一套文艺思想的人过去会脱离人民走上反对人民革命的道路。（未完）
