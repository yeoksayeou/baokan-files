Passing the Qu Yuan Shrine

On the mountainside stands a magnificent temple, its green eaves like the poet’s tall crown, its white walls like the poet's fluttering robes. On the plaque are three golden characters: Qu Gong Shrine. Ah, poet, how did you come here? Did you ride the small boat tossing in the wind and waves, going against the current? Or did you walk with your own feet across the thorny cliffs? You chanted and walked, praising the great mountains and rivers of the motherland; you walked and chanted, endlessly singing the sorrow of leaving the capital and longing for home. Who accompanied you during this thousand-mile exile? Was it boatmen and fishermen, azaleas all over the mountains, or the cuckoos of Sichuan, like you, crying blood? You have a passionate heart, a tender heart; a heart that loves your women with sibling affection. Nüxu—people say she was your sister, who came here to comfort your broken heart. People say this is the stone slab where she washed your clothes, and there is the tomb built for her by later generations, and the temple where your clean clothes and crown are placed, forever evoking the memories of travelers in the gorge.

    过屈原祠半山上站立着一座巍峨的庙宇，青色的飞檐像诗人高高的冠冕，白色的墙壁像诗人飘飘的羽衣，匾额上三个金字：屈公祠。呵，诗人，你怎样来到这里？是乘坐那颠簸在风浪中的小舟，逆流而上？还是用你的双脚走遍了那长满荆棘的绝壁？你且吟且行，歌颂祖国的伟大山川；你且行且吟，唱不尽去国怀乡的忧思。在这千里流放中是谁和你做伴？是舟子渔人，满山的杜鹃，还是那像你一样的蜀中子规，泣血而啼？有一颗热情的心，温柔的心；以手足之情爱你的女人的心。女媭——人们说她是你的姊妹，曾慰借你那破碎的心也来到这里。人们说这是她替你洗衣的石板，那里是后人为她建造的坟墓，和安放着你那清洁衣冠的庙宇，永远会引起峡中旅人的记忆。
