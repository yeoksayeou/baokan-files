Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 15th. Twenty-two well-known agricultural production cooperatives in Henan Province, responding to the initiative of national agricultural labor model Li Shunda and others, and launching an agricultural production increase competition to agricultural cooperatives in Henan Province, recently inspected the implementation of the competition plan in the first half of the year and believe that the established conditions have all been achieved.

This inspection was conducted from the 8th to the 13th at a forum convened by the Henan Provincial People's Committee with the participation of representatives from these twenty-two agricultural cooperatives to examine the implementation of the competition plan. The forum considered that these twenty-two cooperatives had all completed the sowing plan in accordance with state requirements. The eight agricultural production cooperatives, including "Pioneer," which launched a competition to cotton farmers throughout the province with the goal of producing 100 jin of ginned cotton per mu, all implemented seed soaking and mixing this year, and now cotton seedlings have been retained at 5,000 to 7,000 plants per mu in accordance with dense planting requirements. The five agricultural production cooperatives, including "Shuangmiao" in Xiang County, which launched a competition to tobacco-growing areas with the goal of producing 250 jin of flue-cured tobacco per mu, all changed early tobacco from direct seeding to seedling transplanting this year, and also implemented main measures such as high-ridge tobacco planting, timely early sowing, and reasonable close planting.

The nine agricultural production cooperatives that launched a competition to produce 450 jin of grain per mu, due to strengthening field management of summer harvest crops, although continuous rain in the summer harvest season caused some losses to wheat, all completed the production plan. The "Huanghe" agricultural cooperative in Kaifeng County increased wheat production by 49% compared to last year. The "May 1st" agricultural cooperative in Meng County harvested an average of 290 jin per mu on more than 13,567 mu of wheat, of which 5 mu created a maximum record of 1,123 jin per mu.

At the forum, the twenty-two agricultural cooperatives also jointly studied the issue of ensuring the completion of the annual competition plan.

    检查上半年生产情况
    河南省农业社实现了增产竞赛计划
    新华社郑州15日电　响应全国农业劳动模范李顺达等的倡议，并向河南省农业合作社发起开展农业增产竞赛的河南省二十二个著名农业生产合作社，最近检查上半年执行竞赛计划时，认为所制定条件都实现了。
    这次检查是八日至十三日在河南省人民委员会召集的有这二十二个农业社的代表参加的检查竞赛计划执行情况的座谈会上进行的。座谈会认为，这二十二个社都按照国家要求完成了播种计划。以亩产皮棉一百斤为目标向全省棉农发起开展竞赛的“先锋”等八个农业生产合作社，今年棉种都实行了浸种拌种，现在棉苗都根据密植要求，每亩留了五千到七千株。以亩产烤烟二百五十斤为目标向烟区发起开展竞赛的襄县“双庙”等五个农业生产合作社，今年早烟全部由直播改为育苗移栽，同时实行了高垅栽烟、适时早播、合理密植等主要措施。
    发动开展亩产粮食四百五十斤竞赛的九个农业生产合作社，由于加强了夏收作物的田间管理，虽然在夏收季节阴雨连绵，使小麦受到一定损失，但都完成了产量计划。开封县“黄河”农业社小麦比去年增产49％，孟县“五一”农业社一万三千五百六十七亩多小麦，平均每亩实收二百九十斤，其中有五亩创造平均每亩一千一百二十三斤的最高纪录。
    二十二个农业社在座谈会上还共同研究了保证完成全年竞赛计划的问题。
