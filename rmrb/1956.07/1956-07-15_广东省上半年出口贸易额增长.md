    Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, July 13th: Guangdong Province's various ports saw a 27% increase in the total value of export trade in the past six months compared to the same period last year, completing more than half of the annual export plan.

    In the first half of the year, export trade grew to varying degrees, both to the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries, and to capitalist countries. Among the thirty-eight major commodities exported to capitalist countries, twenty-nine expanded their exports, while the rest maintained their original levels.

    Since the beginning of this year, Guangdong's foreign trade departments have taken measures from various aspects to expand export trade. In March and May, export commodity exhibition and exchange conferences were held twice. Through these exchange meetings, Hong Kong and Macao business people and some overseas Chinese merchants were widely organized to manage the export of goods from the motherland. Hundreds of Hong Kong, Macao, and overseas Chinese businesses established trade relations with the motherland for the first time. This year, the foreign trade departments have also actively organized direct ocean-going trade and expanded new sales areas. In terms of exploring export sources and improving business management, the foreign trade departments have also done a lot of work, convening specialized meetings on export commodities such as porcelain and seafood, and resolving problems existing in the sources, quality, and specifications of these commodities.

    广东省上半年出口贸易额增长
    新华社广州13日电　广东省各个口岸在过去六个月中，出口贸易的总额比去年同期增加27％，完成全年出口计划的一半以上。
    上半年，无论是对苏联和人民民主国家，或是对资本主义国家，出口贸易都有不同程度的增长。其中对资本主义国家出口的三十八种大宗商品中，有二十九种扩大了出口，其余的也保持了原有水平。
    广东省对外贸易部门今年以来从多方面采取措施扩大出口贸易。在三月和五月，曾两次举办出口物资展览交流大会，通过这些交流会，广泛组织港澳工商界人士和一部分华侨商人经营祖国的商品出口，有数百家港澳或华侨商号第一次同祖国建立了贸易关系。对外贸易部门今年还积极组织远洋直接贸易和扩展新销区。在发掘出口货源和改进经营管理方面，对外贸易部门也做了许多工作，召开了瓷器、海产品等出口商品的专业会议，解决了这些商品的货源和品质规格等方面存在的问题。
