Xinhua News Agency, July 26th dispatch from Singapore: A mass rally held in Singapore on July 22nd, attended by 5,000 people, called on all anti-colonial political parties in Singapore and the Federation of Malaya to unite and form a national united front.

The rally was initiated by the People's Action Party of Singapore, which announced at the rally its program for fighting for the independence and freedom of the people of Malaya. The program calls for the establishment of an independent Malayan state merged from Malaya and Singapore, in order to end British colonial rule over the people of Malaya.

Toh Chin Chye, Chairman of the People's Action Party, delivered a speech at the rally. He said that the reason for the failure of the London negotiations was that Britain refused to relinquish control over Singapore's internal affairs. He emphasized the importance of strengthening the unity between the people of all ethnic groups in Singapore and the Federation of Malaya at the present time. He said that it is necessary to strictly guard against agitators using the means of inciting ethnic hatred and ethnic disputes to make the people forget the task of fighting for independence.

Lee Kuan Yew, Secretary-General of the People's Action Party, in his speech called on all anti-colonial political parties in Singapore to jointly organize a national united front.

The conference passed a resolution protesting the British government's attempt to maintain colonial rule in Singapore.

This was the first mass rally held in Singapore since the breakdown of the London negotiations. The British colonial authorities in Singapore had repeatedly obstructed the convening of this rally.

    反对英国殖民统治
    新加坡举行群众大会
    号召各政党组织民族联合阵线
    据新华社26日讯　新加坡消息：七月二十二日在新加坡举行的一个有五千人参加的群众大会，号召新加坡和马来亚联合邦一切反殖民主义的政党联合起来组成民族联合阵线。
    这次大会的发起者是新加坡人民行动党，它在大会上宣布了这个党为争取马来亚人民的独立、自由而奋斗的纲领。这个纲领要求建立一个由马来亚和新加坡合并的独立的马来亚国家，以便结束英国对马来亚人民的殖民统治。
    人民行动党的主席杜进才在大会上发表了演说。他说，伦敦谈判失败的原因是由于英国不肯放弃对新加坡内政大权的控制。他强调指出在目前加强新加坡和马来亚联合邦各族人民间的团结的重要性。他说，要严防煽动分子用挑起民族仇恨和民族纠纷的手段来使人民忘记争取独立的斗争任务。
    人民行动党总书记李光耀在讲话中要求新加坡各反殖民主义的政党联合组织一个民族联合阵线。
    大会通过了一项决议，抗议英国政府想在新加坡维持殖民统治的企图。
    这是伦敦谈判破裂以来第一次在新加坡举行的群众大会。新加坡英国殖民当局曾经屡次阻挠这次大会的召开。
