    Another Batch of Products Achieve International Quality Standards
    Thirty-eight major products manufactured by Shanghai local chemical factories have reached international quality standards. Most of these products are reagents for chemical analysis. For example, "Rose Bengal Silver Reagent" produced by Xinzhong Chemical Factory is used to determine metals such as silver, mercury, copper, gold, and lead. The quality of "Sodium Fluosilicate" produced by Dafeng Chemical Factory has exceeded international standards. In the first quarter of this year, one hundred tons were shipped to the United Kingdom.

    又一批产品质量
    达到国际水平
    上海市地方化学工厂制造出来的三十八种主要产品，质量已经达到国际水平。这些产品大部分是作化学分析用的试剂，像新中化学厂生产的“玫瑰红银试剂”是测定银、汞、铜、金、铅等金属用的；大丰化学厂出品的“氟矽酸钠”，质量已超过国际水平，今年第一季度，曾有一百吨运销英国。
