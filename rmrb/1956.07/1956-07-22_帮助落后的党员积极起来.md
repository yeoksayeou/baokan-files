    The *Dazhong Daily* (Shandong) published an editorial on July 7th entitled “Helping Backward Party Members Become Active,” stating that in the new situation of the upsurge of the socialist revolution, the enthusiasm of all Party members should be brought into play more widely and to the greatest extent. Therefore, attention should be paid to helping backward Party members to progress.
    The editorial cites the facts of how the Party organizations in Chuhe Township, Laixi County, and the Second Workshop of Shandong Paper Mill educated and helped backward Party members to progress, illustrating that Party organizations should first conduct investigation and research, and calmly analyze the reasons why each backward Party member is backward. Then, conduct different education and assistance according to different situations. For Party members who have poor awareness and have bad tendencies such as individualism, arrogance, and capitalist ideas, or Party members who have made mistakes, been punished, and are carrying ideological burdens, in addition to education in Party consolidation and daily branch life, individual education and assistance should be carried out according to the different characteristics of each person. For some Party members with various practical difficulties, such as weak work ability, old age and frailty, long-term illness, or many children and busy housework, the Party organization should take care of their practical difficulties, assign them work that they can do, cultivate their work ability, and help them establish work confidence. For some Party members who have real difficulties in their family life, the Party organization should care about their living problems and help them solve their difficulties in life, so that the personal interests of Party members are closely integrated with the interests of the Party.
    The editorial criticizes some Party organizations' wrong ideas and practices in dealing with backward Party members, such as thinking that "backward Party members cannot be reformed," using the excuse that central work is busy and not paying attention to educating them, and adopting rude attitudes or purely organizational means to deal with them. The editorial also pointed out that Party organizations should not lower the standards for Party members to accommodate some people who repeatedly fail to reform and are consistently backward, or tolerate people who are fundamentally incapable of being a Communist Party member remaining in the Party for a long time.

    帮助落后的党员积极起来
    本月七日，大众日报（山东）在“帮助落后的党员积极起来”的社论中提出：在社会主义革命高潮的新形势下，应当更广泛地和最大限度地发挥全体党员的积极性，因此就要注意帮助落后的党员进步。
    社论以莱西县褚河乡和山东造纸总厂第二车间党组织教育、帮助落后党员进步的事实为例，说明党组织首先要进行调查研究，冷静地分析每个落后党员所以落后的原因。然后区别不同的情况进行不同的教育和帮助。对于因觉悟不高而有着个人主义、骄傲情绪、资本主义思想等不良倾向的党员，或犯过错误、受过处分而背思想包袱的党员，除了应当在整党和日常的支部生活中进行教育外，还要根据各人的不同特点进行个别的教育和帮助。对于某些有着各种实际困难的党员，如工作能力弱、年老体弱、长期有病或孩子多、家务忙的党员，党组织要照顾他们的实际困难，分配给他们力所能及的工作，培养他们的工作能力，帮助他们树立起工作信心。对于某些家庭生活确有困难的党员，党组织要关心他们的生活问题，帮助他们解决生活上的困难，使得党员的个人利益和党的利益密切结合起来。
    社论批判了有些党组织对待落后党员的错误想法和做法，如认为“落后党员不可改造”，借口中心工作忙而不注意对他们进行教育，采取粗暴的态度或单纯的组织手段对待他们。社论同时指出，党组织也不可以降低党员标准去迁就某些屡教不改而一贯落后的人，或者容忍根本不能做一个共产党员的人长期留在党内。
