Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, July 26th: The First Shanghai Municipal Congress of the Communist Party of China concluded today after thirteen days. The primary task of the meeting was to discuss and determine the direction of Shanghai's industrial construction.

	Ke Qingshi, the First Secretary of the previous Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, stated in his report to the Congress that as a coastal industrial base, Shanghai has made tremendous contributions to the country's socialist construction since liberation. It is expected that Shanghai will reach the industrial production target set by the state's first Five-Year Plan one year ahead of schedule. This year, Shanghai's industrial output value will increase by more than three times compared to 1949. In the past six years, the total enterprise profits and taxes submitted by the city to the state were equivalent to more than one-fifth of the total investment in capital construction in the first Five-Year Plan. More than 210,000 technical personnel, workers, and cadres have been transferred to other regions. Nearly 30,000 metal-cutting machine tools have been transferred out.

	Ke Qingshi said that although Shanghai's industrial production has greatly developed in the past few years, the Municipal Committee did not fully estimate the potential of Shanghai's industry and its role in socialist construction in the past, and its analysis of the objective situation was not comprehensive. As a result, there was vacillation in actual work as to whether Shanghai's industry should be developed, maintained, or reduced. There were fewer positive plans and more negative considerations. This inevitably affected the development of Shanghai's industry and the improvement of technology to a certain extent. He proposed that the future direction of Shanghai's industrial construction is to "fully utilize Shanghai's industrial potential and rationally develop Shanghai's industrial production," and based on this new direction, he put forward inspiring long-term plans for Shanghai's industry.

	Ke Qingshi also made a self-criticism on behalf of the previous Municipal Committee for the serious shortcomings in the past implementation of wage reform and the "one-chief system" in state-owned enterprises, as well as the serious bureaucratic style of work.

	The meeting promoted democracy and carried out criticism and self-criticism. 124 representatives made oral and written speeches to the Congress, raising many opinions on the Municipal Committee and various leadership departments.

	The representatives unanimously agreed with Ke Qingshi's report, believing that the policy of "full utilization and rational development" adopted for Shanghai's industrial construction is completely correct, and decided to submit this new policy to the upcoming Municipal People's Congress for discussion. At the same time, the representatives also criticized that due to the vacillation in the Shanghai industrial policy implemented by the Municipal Committee in the past, the industrial management departments only focused on requiring factories to increase production, and did not correspondingly improve equipment and workers' working conditions, which has affected the further improvement of product quality and the safe operation of workers. The training of cadres has also been restricted as a result. A large number of technicians and cadres were transferred from many factory departments, but little new blood was added, which weakened the old factories while supporting the new factories.

	Representatives pointed out in their speeches that the implementation of the "one-chief system" in Shanghai's state-owned enterprises has fostered a commandist work style and seriously detached itself from the masses. The representatives unanimously believed that this situation should be taken as a profound lesson. The meeting believed that it is necessary to strengthen the Party's leadership over industrial enterprises, establish the leading position of Party organizations in industrial enterprises, and implement comprehensive leadership over enterprise production and management, as well as political and ideological work.

	The meeting unanimously agreed that to mobilize all forces to accelerate socialist construction, it is necessary to promote democracy and carry out criticism and self-criticism. Many representatives believed that there was insufficient democratic life within the Party in the past, especially a lack of bottom-up criticism. The representatives proposed that it is necessary to cultivate cadres' ability to think independently and their spirit of bold responsibility, and to change the current cautious, mediocre, and sluggish work style within the Party. It is necessary to oppose being like an abacus bead, moving only when nudged; on the other hand, it is also necessary to oppose those who like to calculate everything. Some representatives put forward many practical and feasible suggestions for changing this situation.

	The Congress believed that to thoroughly transform Shanghai, an industrial city that has developed abnormally for more than a century, the Party organization in Shanghai must greatly improve its level of Marxism-Leninism and conscientiously overcome the subjective work style in its work. The representatives made sharp criticisms of the ideological work style of some candidates. After research, the presidium accepted the opinions of the representatives and made adjustments to a small number of candidates. Finally, forty new members of the Municipal Committee were elected, with one vacancy reserved for re-election after adjustment in the suburbs; fifteen alternate members were elected; and thirty-seven representatives to the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China and four alternate representatives were elected.

	More than 700 representatives attended this Congress, representing 150,000 Communist Party members in Shanghai.

### 上海市召开党代表大会讨论和确定工业建设方针

    上海市召开党代表大会讨论和确定工业建设方针
    会议认为：必须确立党组织在企业中的领导地位，发扬民主，调动一切积极力量加速社会主义建设
    据新华社上海26日电　中共上海市第一次代表大会今天闭幕。会议共举行了十三天。这次会议的首要任务是讨论和确定上海工业建设的方针。
    前届中共上海市委员会第一书记柯庆施向大会作的报告说：作为沿海工业基地的上海，解放以来对国家的社会主义建设作出了巨大的贡献。预计上海将要提前一年达到国家第一个五年计划所规定的工业生产指标的水平。今年上海的工业产值将比1949年增加两倍以上。六年来，全市各系统上缴给国家的企业利润税款相当于我国第一个五年计划基本建设投资总额的五分之一以上。输送到外地的技术人员、工人和干部有二十一万多人。调出的金属切削机床近三万台。
    柯庆施说：虽然过去几年上海的工业生产有了很大的发展，但是由于过去市委对上海工业的潜力以及它在社会主义建设中的作用估计不足，对客观情况分析不全面，因而在实际工作中对上海的工业究竟是发展、维持还是缩小，曾经发生过摇摆。从积极方面打算少，从消极方面考虑多。这就不可避免地使上海工业的发展和技术的提高受到一定的影响。他提出今后上海工业建设的方针是：“充分利用上海工业潜力，合理发展上海工业生产”，并且根据新方针又提出了振奋人心的上海工业远景规划。
    柯庆施还代表前届市委对过去执行工资改革和在国营企业推行“一长制”的严重缺点，以及作风上的严重的事务主义作了自我批评。
    会议发扬了民主，展开了批评与自我批评。有124个代表向大会作了口头和书面发言，对市委和各领导部门提出了不少意见。
    代表们一致同意柯庆施的报告。认为上海工业建设采取“充分利用，合理发展”的方针是完全正确的，并且决议将这个新方针提交即将举行的市人民代表大会讨论。同时，代表们也批评了由于过去市委执行上海工业方针摇摆，工业管理部门只顾要求工厂增产，没有相应地改善设备和工人的劳动条件，已经影响到产品质量的进一步提高和工人的安全操作。培养干部也因此受到限制，许多工厂部门调走了大批技术工人和干部，但是很少补充新血液，这样就造成支援了新厂，削弱了老厂。
    代表们发言中指出，上海的国营企业推行“一长 制”以后滋长了命令主义作风，严重地脱离了群众。代表们一致认为，对这一情况应该引为深刻的教训。会议认为，必须加强党对工业企业的领导，确立党组织在工业企业中的领导地位，对企业生产管理工作，政治思想工作实行全面的领导。
    会议一致认为，要调动一切力量来加速社会主义建设，必须发扬民主，开展批评与自我批评。许多代表认为，过去党内民主生活不够，特别缺少自下而上的批评。代表们提出，一定要培养干部独立思考的能力和大胆负责的精神，改变目前党内存在的谨小慎微、庸俗和疲沓的作风。要反对做算盘珠，拨一下动一下；另一方面也要反对喜欢打算盘的人。有些代表提出了不少切实可行的、改变这一情况的建议。
    大会认为，要彻底改造上海这一百多年来畸形发展起来的工业城市，上海的党组织必须大大提高马克思列宁主义水平，认真克服工作中的主观主义作风。　代表们对某些候选人的思想作风提出了尖锐的批评。主席团经过研究，接受了代表们的意见，对少数候选人作了调整。最后选出新的市委委员四十人，一个空额留给市郊调整后再补选；候补委员十五人；选出出席中共第八次全国代表大会的代表三十七人，候补代表四人。
    出席这次大会的代表有七百多人，代表着上海市十五万中共党员。
