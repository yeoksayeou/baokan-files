　　Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 26th -- The "Economic Weekly" in the Berlin Democratic sector recently published an article stating that, according to the most conservative estimates by West German newspapers, West Germany's actual military expenditure for the 1956-57 fiscal year reaches 16 billion marks.

　　The article points out that West German Finance Minister Schäffer admitted that, in addition to military spending formally included in the budget, West Germany has additional military expenditures. The article says that many military appropriations are not ostensibly classified as military expenditures. For example, 88 million marks are earmarked for expanding the air defense system, and 24 million marks are prepared for the activities of the Gehlen intelligence organization; these funds have not been listed as military expenditures.

　　The article also says that West German military expenditure formally included in the budget is 8.7 billion marks, an increase of 67.3% over last year. Of this amount, 1.2 billion marks will be used to build airports, 35 million marks will be used to expand the aviation industry, 560 million marks will be used to purchase tanks, and 360 million marks will be used to build warships.

    西德本年度军费
    达一百六十亿马克
    新华社柏林26日电　柏林民主区的“经济周刊”最近刊载的一篇文章说，据西德报纸所作的最谨慎的估计，西德1956—57年度的实际军事开支达到一百六十亿马克。
    这篇文章指出，西德财政部长谢菲尔承认，除正式列入预算的军费外，西德还有额外的军费。文章说，有许多军事拨款表面上并不属于军事开支。例如，有八千八百万马克预定用于扩大防空体系，有二千四百万马克准备拨作盖伦间谋组织的活动费用，这些款项都没有被列为军事开支。
    文章还说，正式被列入预算的西德军费是八十七亿马克，比去年增加了67.3％。这笔款中有十二亿马克将用来修建飞机场，三千五百万马克将用来扩大航空工业，五亿六千万马克将用来购买坦克，三亿六千万马克将用来建造军舰。
