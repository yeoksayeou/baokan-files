Zhengzhou and Changsha Actively Prepare to Popularize Primary School Compulsory Education
All School-Age Children Will Enroll This Autumn

    (Our newspaper reports) Zhengzhou City, Henan Province, will implement universal compulsory primary education this autumn. According to the recent statistics from the Municipal Education Bureau, there are still 7,399 school-age children in the urban area who have not enrolled, and it is estimated that 2,500 more school-age children will move in from other places due to the development of industrial construction. In order to solve the enrollment problem of the relocated and unenrolled school-age children, in addition to rationally adding classes to the original primary schools and appropriately implementing the two-shift system to expand enrollment, two new primary schools (with a capacity of 1,200 students) have recently been completed, and the construction of another new primary school is being prepared. Regarding the shortage of teachers, in addition to some being filled by graduates of preschool normal schools, excellent middle school graduates and knowledgeable housewives with equivalent junior high school education are being actively selected and given short-term training to supplement the teaching staff.

    (Our newspaper reports) More than 17,000 school-age children in Changsha City who have not yet enrolled will all be able to attend schools near their residences in September this year. The city's preparations for the implementation of universal compulsory education are actively underway.

    Implementing universal compulsory education is a work plan formulated by the Changsha City Education Bureau this spring. Currently, the city has completed the census of school-age children who have not yet enrolled. The difficulty of insufficient classrooms has now also been resolved. The two-shift system will be fully implemented in the first grade of primary school, and the two-shift system will be partially implemented in the second grade, so that all school-age children can attend school for half a day and study independently at home for the other half of the day with the help of teachers and parents. In the new school year, the city will add 108 teachers. In the Chengnan and Chengdong areas, where the population is large and there are few schools, the school buildings of two complete primary schools are under construction and will be completed soon, and students will be able to attend classes in the new classrooms in September. In the process of preparing for universal compulsory education, Changsha City has received assistance from government agencies at all levels, residents' committees, and the vast number of teachers. Parents regard this as good news and are now preparing to send their children to school.

    In 1949, when Changsha City was liberated, there were only more than 27,000 students in junior primary schools and complete primary schools, but now there are more than 58,000 students. With the addition of more than 17,000 school-age children who are about to enroll, the total number of primary school students in the city will reach more than 75,000 this autumn. (Gao Changren)

    郑州长沙积极准备普及小学义务教育
    学龄儿童今秋将全部入学
    本报讯　河南省郑州市区将在今年秋季实施普及小学义务教育。据市教育局最近统计：市区未入学的学龄儿童还有7，399名，估计随着工业建设的发展，还会由外地迁来学龄儿童2，500名。为了解决迁来的和未入学的学龄儿童入学问题，除原有小学校合理增添班次、适当推行二部制，以扩大入学儿童外，最近还新建成两个小学校（容1，200个学生），另一个新建小学校正在准备施工。关于不足的师资，除由幼儿师范毕业生充任一部分外，现正积极从中学毕业生和有相当于初中程度的家庭知识妇女中选择优秀的，予以短期训练来补充。
    本报讯　长沙市现有的一万七千多名尚未入学的学龄儿童，在今年九月份可以全部到住所附近的学校读书。全市为实施普及义务教育的准备工作正在积极进行着。
    实施普及义务教育，是长沙市教育局今年春季制订出的工作规划。现在，全市已完成了尚未入学的学龄儿童的普查工作。教室不足的困难现在也有办法解决了。在小学一年级将全部实行二部制，二年级部分实行二部制，这样可使所有学龄儿童都能半天上学，半天在家，由教师和家长帮助自修。在新学年里，全市将增加108名教师。在城南、城东人口多、学校少的地区，两所完全小学的校舍正在建筑，很快就要完工，九月份学生们就可在新教室内上课了。长沙市在进行普及义务教育准备工作中，得到各级政府机关、居民委员会和广大教师的协助，家长们都把这件事当作喜讯，现在正纷纷准备送孩子上学。
    长沙市在1949年解放时初级小学和完全小学的学生只有二万七千多人，现在已有五万八千多人。加上即将入学的一万七千多名学龄儿童，全市小学生总数到秋季可达到七万五千多名了。　（高长任）
