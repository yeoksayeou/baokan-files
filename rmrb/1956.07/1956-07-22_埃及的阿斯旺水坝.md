    The Aswan Dam in Egypt

    Egyptian agriculture relies mainly on irrigation from the Nile River. Due to the extremely low rainfall in Egypt, many reservoirs have been built to continue using river water for irrigation outside the Nile's flood season. However, the Nile's flow during the annual flood season (July to November) is extremely high, and existing reservoirs fill up in just five days. The excess water flows into the sea, sometimes causing floods. During the dry season (December to June), reservoir storage is insufficient, sometimes leading to drought.

    To better utilize the Nile's water and further develop agricultural production, the Egyptian government plans to build a large high dam six and a half kilometers south of the existing low dam in Aswan Province. According to the plan, the dam will be 110 meters high, 5 kilometers long, and 1,300 meters wide at the base. The reservoir behind the dam will be 6 kilometers wide and 500 kilometers long, capable of storing 130 billion cubic meters of water, 26 times larger than the existing reservoir, and will be the largest artificial lake in the world. Once this dam is completed, it can almost entirely store floodwaters during the flood season, regulating the needs of the dry season. It can also irrigate more than 2 million acres of desert in Egypt, increasing the nation's arable land by one-third. Furthermore, the dam can generate 10 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity annually, greatly benefiting the development of Egypt's industrial production. Egyptian President Nasser said, "This dam is extremely important to our economy."

    The total cost of the Aswan Dam construction project is estimated at $1.3 billion. The Egyptian government, due to its limited capacity, hopes to receive some foreign assistance. According to Egyptian sources, the Soviet Union has expressed its willingness to provide Egypt with the assistance it desires in constructing this dam. The United States and Britain also appeared very "enthusiastic" for a time. On December 17th of last year, the U.S. State Department issued a statement regarding assisting Egypt in realizing the Aswan Dam project, saying, "This project has incalculable importance in developing the Egyptian economy and improving the welfare of the Egyptian people," therefore "the United States... assures the Egyptian government that it... will support this project" and decided to "grant funds." The U.S. State Department recently, on July 6th, reiterated the assurance that "this proposal remains valid." However, because Egypt insisted on a peaceful and independent policy, the United States saw that it could not buy Egypt's freedom with dollars. Thus, just a few days later, precisely when the Egyptian government indicated that it had decided to accept U.S. help in building the Aswan Dam, the United States announced its decision to withdraw its proposal to help Egypt build the Aswan Dam, and was even unwilling to give the already promised $56 million.

### 埃及的阿斯旺水坝

    埃及的阿斯旺水坝
    埃及的农业主要依靠尼罗河的灌溉。由于埃及雨量极少，为了在尼罗河涨水的季节以外能够继续利用河水进行灌溉，埃及已经建设了很多蓄水池。但是尼罗河每年涨水季节（七月至十一月）的流量极高，现有的水库只消五天就装满了，多余的水白白地流到海里去，有时还要泛滥成灾，而到枯水季节（每年十二月至次年六月），水库的蓄水又不够用，有时造成干旱。
    埃及政府为了更好地利用尼罗河河水，以进一步发展农业生产，计划在阿斯旺省现有的低水坝以南六公里半的地方，再建设一个大的高水坝。按照计划，这个水坝堤高110公尺，长五公里，坝底宽一千三百公尺。坝身后面的水库宽六公里，长五百公里，可以蓄水一千三百亿立方公尺，比现有的水库大二十六倍，将是世界上最大的一个人工湖。这个坝建成之后，就几乎可以把涨水时期的洪水全部积贮下来，用以调节枯水季节的需要，并且可以使现在埃及二百多万英亩的沙漠获得灌溉，增加全国可耕土地三分之一。此外，水坝还可以每年发电一百亿度，大大有利于埃及工业生产的发展。埃及总统纳赛尔说过：“这个水坝对于我们的经济是十分重要的。”
    阿斯旺水坝建设工程的全部费用预计要十三亿美元，埃及政府因本身能力有限，所以希望能得到外国的一些援助。据埃及方面的消息说，苏联表示愿意给予埃及在修建这个水坝方面以它所希望得到的援助。美国和英国一度也表现得非常“热心”。去年十二月十七日，美国国务院发表关于协助埃及实现阿斯旺水坝计划的公告说，“这个计划在发展埃及经济和增进埃及人民的福利方面具有无可估计的重要性”，因此“美国……向埃及政府保证它……将支持这个计划”，决定“赠予款项”。美国国务院最近在七月六日还再度提出了“这个建议仍然有效”的保证，但是由于埃及坚持和平独立的政策，美国看到用美元并不能买到埃及的自由，因此，不过几天之后，正是埃及政府表示已决定接受美国帮助建筑阿斯旺水坝的时候，美国却宣布它已决定撤销帮助埃及修建阿斯旺水坝的建议，连已答应的五千六百万美元都不愿意给了。
