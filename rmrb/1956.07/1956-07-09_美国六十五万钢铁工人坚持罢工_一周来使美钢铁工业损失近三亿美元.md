Xinhua News Agency, July 8th, New York Dispatch: The major strike of 650,000 American steelworkers, which began on July 1st, has persisted for a week. Steelworkers are refusing to return to work because steel companies have rejected the demands made by the union.

The union is demanding a three-year wage contract, with a wage increase of $0.20 per hour in the first year of the contract. However, the steel companies insist on raising hourly wages and benefits by only about $0.17, with the contract lasting for as long as four years and four months.

Mediation negotiations conducted by the U.S. government with both the companies and the union have not yielded results. Reports state that the government is considering taking new steps to interfere with the strike, one of which is to invoke the Taft-Hartley Act to prohibit the steelworkers from continuing their strike.

The strike is gradually expanding to American steel company factories in Canada. Most of the workers at the American steel company's steel plant in Hamilton, Canada, are advocating for a strike. Workers at the United Delran Steel Company (a subsidiary of American Republic Steel Company) in Hamilton and the Marmora Mining Company (a subsidiary of American Bethlehem Steel Company) in Marmora went on strike for one day on July 3rd to show their support for the American steelworkers.

According to statistics, due to the strike, the operating rate of the American steel industry last week was 13%, with a steel production of 320,000 tons (the operating rate in the week before the strike was 84.9%, with a steel production of 2.09 million tons). The total loss to the steel industry due to the strike in one week is estimated at $280 million.

Many other American industries, such as the railway industry, trucking industry, and coal mining industry, have also been affected and are reducing production. With the reduction in steel supply, the U.S. government has designated some special steel for government use only, in order to ensure military production. In the steel market, black market prices for steel are skyrocketing.

The steel industry magazine "Steel Age" believes that the strike will not be resolved in the short term. The magazine points out that if the strike lasts for eight weeks like in 1952, it will "bring chaos to all major industries that consume steel," and even a two-week strike could "completely disrupt" every construction plan in the United States.

    美国六十五万钢铁工人坚持罢工
    一周来使美钢铁工业损失近三亿美元
    新华社8日讯　纽约消息：从七月一日开始的美国六十五万钢铁工人的大罢工已经坚持了一个星期。由于钢铁公司拒绝工会方面提出的要求，钢铁工人们拒绝复工。
    工会要求签订为期三年的工资合同，在合同第一年，每小时增加工资两角美元。但是，钢铁公司坚持每小时工资和福利待遇只提高一角七分美元左右，合同的期限要长达四年零四个月。
    美国政府分别同公司和工会进行的调解谈判没有取得结果。消息说，政府正在考虑采取新的干涉罢工步骤，其中之一就是运用塔夫脱—哈特莱法，禁止钢铁工人继续罢工。
    罢工正逐渐扩大到在加拿大的美国钢铁公司工厂里去。美国钢铁公司在加拿大哈密尔顿的钢铁厂的大部分工人都主张举行罢工。哈密尔顿的联合德拉恩钢铁公司（美国共和钢铁公司的分公司）和在马尔摩拉的马尔摩拉顿开采公司（美国伯利恒钢铁公司的分公司）的工人们在七月三日曾经停止工作一天，表示支援美国的钢铁工人。
    据统计，由于罢工的原故，美国钢铁工业在上周的开工率是13％，生产的钢铁为三十二万吨（罢工前的一周的开工率为84.9％，钢铁生产为二百零九万吨）。总计罢工在一周内给钢铁工业带来的损失为二亿八千万美元。
    美国其他许多行业，例如铁路业、卡车运输业和煤矿工业也受到影响，而削减生产。在钢铁供应减少的情况下，美国政府已经指定一些特种钢铁只能由政府使用，以保证军火生产。在钢铁市场上，钢铁的黑市价格正在暴涨。
    钢铁业的杂志“钢铁时代”认为，罢工在短期内不会得到解决。杂志指出，如果罢工像1952年那样延续八个星期，它就会“给所有消费钢铁的大工业带来混乱”，甚至两个星期的罢工都可以“完全打乱”美国的每一个建筑计划。
