    Basic-Level Supply and Marketing Cooperatives in Various Parts of Jiangsu Province Promote Rotating Rest System for Sales Staff
    (Our Newspaper News) Basic-level supply and marketing cooperatives in various parts of Jiangsu Province are actively promoting a rotating rest system for sales staff. More than 160 basic-level stores have now implemented a rotating rest system on the basis of the "Small Group Business Responsibility System," and more than 1,000 stores are preparing to implement it.
    In the past, basic-level supply and marketing cooperatives in Jiangsu Province did not have a rest system, and overwork not only affected physical health but also directly affected work. In stores, there was a common phenomenon of low work efficiency and many errors. Since the promotion of the rotating rest system, it has been widely welcomed by the staff. The work efficiency of the staff has improved, and work errors and cargo losses have also been reduced. For example, the Banqiao Sales Department in Jiangning County implemented the rotating rest system earlier. In the past, there were errors every month. In the year or more since the implementation of the "Small Group Business Responsibility System" and the rotating rest system, errors have been basically eliminated, the cotton cloth loss rate has dropped from 0.85% to 0.15%, and the work quota has increased by an average of more than 50% compared with the past.

    江苏省各地基层供销社推广营业员轮流休息制
    本报讯　江苏省各地基层供销社正在积极推广营业员的轮流休息制度。现在已有一百六十多个基层商店在“小组营业责任制”的基础上实行了轮休制度，还有一千多个商店正准备实行。
    江苏省基层供销合作社过去没有休息制度，工作过度疲劳，不仅影响身体健康，而且也直接影响工作。商店里普遍存在着工作效率不高，差错很多的现象。轮休制度推广以来，受到广大职工的普遍欢迎，工作人员的劳动效率提高，工作差错和货物损耗也减少了。例如江宁县板桥门市部实行轮休制较早，过去月月有差错，实行了“小组营业责任制”和轮休制的一年多来，基本上消灭了差错，棉布损耗率从0.85％下降到0.15％，工作定额平均比过去增加了50％以上。
