Tianjin Steel Plant Open Hearth Steelworkers
Average 27 Tons More Steel Per Person in Half a Year
    Tianjin Steel Plant's open-hearth steelworkers, under the same equipment conditions this year, produced an average of twenty-seven tons more steel per worker than in the same period last year.
    In the first half of this year, the steelworkers, based on the specific conditions of the factory's equipment, studied the advanced steelmaking experience of Soviet steelworker Kolesnikov, changed their past operating habits, and fully utilized the crucial moment immediately after tapping the steel. They closely followed the charging machine, directing the workers driving the charging machine to distribute the charge according to the flame strength, so that the raw materials that were not easy to melt were put into the most intense flame. In addition, according to Kolesnikov's experience, they adopted the operating method of alternating tapping, furnace repair, and charging, which resulted in the average smelting time per furnace of steel being shortened by one hour and five minutes compared with the same period last year.
    This factory has also achieved new results in shortening cold repair time and thermal control. Since the beginning of this year, the gas furnace workers have maintained the highest temperature in all open hearth furnaces from charging to tapping. (According to Xinhua News Agency)

    天津钢厂中型平炉炼钢工人
    半年平均每人多炼出27吨钢
    天津钢厂中型平炉炼钢工人，今年上半年在设备相同的条件下，平均每个工人比去年同期多炼了二十七吨钢。
    在今年上半年里，炼钢工人们根据厂内设备的具体情况，学习了苏联优秀炼钢工人科列斯尼科夫的快速炼钢经验，改变了过去的操作习惯，在一出完钢，就充分利用了这个最紧要的时刻，紧跟着加料机，指挥驾驶加料机的工人，根据火焰强弱布料，使不容易熔化的原料投入到最旺炽的火焰中去。此外，他们还按照科列斯尼科夫的经验，采取了出钢、补炉和加料交叉进行的操作方法，因而使今年上半年每炉钢的平均冶炼时间比去年同期缩短了一小时零五分钟。
    这个工厂在缩短冷修时间和热工控制等方面，也取得了新的成绩。今年以来，煤气炉工人使所有的平炉从加料到出钢都一直保持了最高的温度。　（据新华社讯）
