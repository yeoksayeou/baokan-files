    The Egyptian People Can Definitely Manage the Suez Canal Well

    Egypt's nationalization of the Suez Canal has panicked the imperialists. While making threats, they say: the Egyptian government "has no ability to manage this canal. Egypt has no technical personnel." Frankly speaking, as Chinese people, we are already tired of hearing this kind of talk from the imperialists. Didn't they say "the Chinese can't manage Anshan Iron and Steel," "the Chinese can't manage Shanghai"? What was the result? We not only managed it well, but we managed it very well, extremely well! I believe that the wise and courageous Egyptian people will definitely be able to manage the Suez Canal well, turning Suez from a river serving the imperialists into a river serving the Egyptian people and world peace.

    埃及人民一定能管好苏彝士运河
    埃及把苏彝士运河收归国有，使得帝国主义者们发慌了。他们一面进行威胁，一面说：埃及政府“没有能力管理这条运河。埃及没有技术人员”。老实说，作为中国人，帝国主义者的这一套我们已经听腻了。他们不是说“中国人管理不好鞍钢”、“中国人管理不了上海”吗？结果怎样呢？我们不但管理好了，而且管理得十分好，非常好！我相信，智慧、勇敢的埃及人民也一定可以把苏彝士运河管好，使苏彝士从一条为帝国主义者服务的河流，变成一条为埃及人民和世界和平服务的河流。
