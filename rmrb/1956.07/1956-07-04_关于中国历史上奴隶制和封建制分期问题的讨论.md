    Discussion on the Periodization of Slavery and Feudalism in Chinese History
    Jiang Quan
    In recent years, the discussion on the periodization of slavery and feudalism in Chinese history has attracted widespread attention in historical circles. This issue has long been one of the important issues that historians have been very concerned about and demanded to be resolved. Correctly resolving the periodization of Chinese slave society and feudal society is not only of great significance for the study of ancient Chinese history, but also of great help for the study of Chinese philosophy and other specialized histories. At the same time, history teachers will no longer feel confused and difficult when teaching the social nature of the period from the Western Zhou to the Qin and Han dynasties as they do now.
    Regarding the periodization of Chinese slavery and feudalism, there are basically three different opinions in Chinese historical circles: (1) It is believed that feudal society began in the Western Zhou Dynasty; (2) It is believed that the Western Zhou Dynasty was still a slave society, and the beginning of feudal society was at the turn of the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods (or the Qin and Han dynasties); (3) It is believed that the Han Dynasty was also a slave society, and the lower limit of slavery was set in the late Eastern Han Dynasty or the Wei and Jin Dynasties.

    The first opinion: Feudal society began in the Western Zhou Dynasty
    Historians who advocate that feudal society began in the Western Zhou Dynasty include Fan Wenlan, etc.
    Fan Wenlan believes that the main key to distinguishing slave society from feudal society is "the transformation of exploitation methods" and "the difference in ownership"; "as for the changes in the production tool making, it is not necessarily decisive in the transformation from slavery to feudalism." Based on this periodization standard, he believes that new feudal relations of production had already appeared in the Zhou state during the time of Gugong Danfu. "Because the Zhou valued agriculture from generation to generation, and the Zhou monarchs knew from experience that encouraging the production enthusiasm of farmers was an important condition for enhancing productivity, their attitude towards farmers was not as brutal as that of general slave owners towards slaves... The development of this experience made it possible to abandon slaves and prefer to use serfs." The reason why Zhou was able to destroy Shang was precisely because the new system society would inevitably defeat the old system society. (Fan Wenlan: On Some Issues in Chinese History, "Section 6" "The Initial Feudal Society Began in the Western Zhou Dynasty," contained in "Collected Papers of the Third Institute of the Institute of History of the Chinese Academy of Sciences," Volume 1. "A Brief History of China," Revised Edition, Volume 1, Chapter 3.)
    Fan Wenlan and historians who hold the same view as him believe that the main basis for the Western Zhou Dynasty being a feudal society is that, judging from the phrases in the "Book of Songs" such as "Order my people, prepare your hoes and sickles, and inspect the weeding" and "Rain on my public fields, and then on my private fields," the producers in the Western Zhou Dynasty already had their own labor tools and land that actually belonged to them. In addition, they had their own economy and were attached to the land. They spent part of their time engaged in production on the land they used—"private fields"—and another part of their time engaged in production on the lord's land—"public fields." This form of exploitation of direct producers was already the form of exploitation in feudal society. They were different from the slaves of the Yin Dynasty and could not be slaughtered at will, which can be proved by the fact that there were a large number of human sacrifices in the Shang Dynasty, while sacrifices in the Zhou Dynasty did not use people (archaeologists have excavated one hundred and fifty-six Western Zhou and Eastern Zhou tombs, and only found six sacrificial people in three tombs). These historians also pointed out that the state of productivity in the Western Zhou Dynasty did not appear to significantly exceed that of the Yin Dynasty, because the feudal system did not immediately exert its superiority over the slave system. They believe that there is no reason to judge whether a feudal society exists based on the presence or absence of iron tools. When talking about the great enfeoffment in the early Zhou Dynasty, they said that this precisely demonstrated the land ownership form of feudal society. Based on this enfeoffment system was the peasants' personal dependence on the land owners and the strict hierarchical system within the exploiting class. The so-called patriarchal system was the superstructure of feudalism, which was an organizational force to strengthen the rule for the aristocratic lords. In terms of ideology, the slogan of the ruling class from the Western Zhou to the Spring and Autumn period was "to harmonize the people with virtue," and "the people" referred to "peasants," which was precisely a reflection of the new foundation different from slavery.
    Of course, the views of historians who advocate that the Western Zhou Dynasty was a feudal society are not consistent on all issues. For example, Wang Yuzhe and others have put forward different opinions on Fan Wenlan's estimate of the socio-economic situation in the early Zhou Dynasty. They believe that the Zhou clan was still in the late stage of clan society before conquering Shang, and was more backward than the Yin clan in terms of both economic and cultural development. The Zhou's destruction of Shang was not due to the new mode of production defeating the old mode of production, but because the slave system economy of the Shang kingdom had reached its end. After the Zhou destroyed Shang, it gradually transitioned to feudal society on the ruins of the Yin clan slave system, which is similar to the Germanic tribes in Western Europe destroying the Roman slave kingdom and transitioning to feudal society. (Wang Yuzhe: "Several Opinions on the First Volume of Fan's 'A Brief History of China,' Revised Edition," contained in "Historical Research," Issue 6, 1954.)
    Regarding public fields and private fields, Xu Zhongshu, Yang Xiangkui, and others also have different explanations from Fan Wenlan. They believe that it was a field system of a family commune or a rural commune. When discussing the feudal system of the Western Zhou Dynasty, they conducted more investigations from this aspect. Xu Zhongshu said that "private fields" were the allotted fields of the commune members; the rulers extracted a portion of the commune's land and used farmers to cultivate it, which was called "public fields." Public fields and private fields had a certain proportion, ten to one or eight to one. This system of service of the commune members with a certain proportion was precisely the labor rent form of feudal society. He also pointed out that after the Zhou people conquered the East, they could not change the local commune system, but could only plunder the public land formerly occupied by the village commune and the surplus labor of the commune members on the public land. The rulers and their tribes lived in the country, called "Guoren" (people of the state); the ruled village commune communities were called "Yeren" (people of the countryside). Guoren and Yeren were always two opposing groups with different identities until the Spring and Autumn period. (Xu Zhongshu: "A Tentative Discussion on the Field System and Its Social Nature in the Zhou Dynasty," contained in "Journal of Sichuan University," Issue 2, 1955.) Yang Xiangkui believes that there were two different field systems and different forms of land rent in the Zhou Dynasty. The "Guoren" lived in the countryside and were free farmers' commune organizations, practicing the "tribute" system, that is, paying tribute and taxes to the lords. The "Yeren" lived in the capital and their identities were serfs. Their original commune organizations had been destroyed and were reorganized by the rulers. Here, the "help" system was implemented, that is, providing labor rent to the lords. He also particularly emphasized the imbalance in the development of various regions in ancient China. (Yang Xiangkui: "On the Social Nature of the Western Zhou Dynasty," contained in "Literature, History and Philosophy," Issue 5, 1952. "Several Issues Concerning the Periodization of Ancient Chinese History," contained in "Historical Research," Issue 5, 1956.)
    People who oppose that the Western Zhou Dynasty was a feudal society disagree with the opinions of the above historians. First, they criticize Fan Wenlan's opinion on the periodization standard for ignoring the role of the law that the relations of production must be suitable for the nature of the productive forces. Wu Dakun proposed that the "sole standard for dividing slave society and feudal society is the state of the productive forces and relations of production of the society at that time, and the two are closely combined and cannot be separated."
    (Wu Dakun: "Discussion on the Social Nature of the Western Zhou Dynasty," contained in "Historical Research," Issue 3, 1956) Wang Renzhi and others agreed that "the main key to distinguishing two social forms lies in the difference in the relations of production," but also believed that "in order to comprehensively and completely distinguish two connected social forms, it is necessary to go to the unity of the relations of production and the productive forces—that is, to find in the mode of production." (Wang Renzhi et al.: "Several Opinions on 'A Brief History of China,'" contained in "Teaching and Research," Issue 3, 1955.) Secondly, they believe that Fan Wenlan's explanation of the changes in the relations of production in the early Zhou Dynasty is divorced from the material living conditions of society and seeks the reasons for social development from the "experience" or "wishes" of individual figures. They said that since the Western Zhou Dynasty had not yet seen the emergence of iron tools, it was impossible to cause huge changes in the productive forces, and it was impossible to produce independent individual production, and therefore it could not produce feudal society. Wu Dakun believes that only after the productive forces of feudal society are produced within the slave society can we talk about the collapse of the slave society and its replacement by the feudal society. They also pointed out that no matter what kind of social form, it will never die before the productive forces that obtain sufficient development space from it have not been fully developed. The productive forces of the Yin Dynasty's slave system had not been fully developed, so it cannot be said that the Yin Dynasty's slave society had reached its end. They also disagreed with Wang Yuzhe and others comparing the Zhou's destruction of Shang to the Germanic tribes destroying the Roman Empire. Because the two situations have essential differences, Yin Zhou was still in the stage of patriarchal slavery and was not a "ruin of slavery."
    Guo Moruo pointed out that Zuo Zhuan, Dinggong Four Years, recorded that after King Wu conquered Shang, he enfeoffed the "six clans of Yin people," "seven clans of Yin people," and "nine clans of Huai surname" to Duke Lu, Kang Shu, and Tang Shu. It can be seen that the Zhou people transformed a large number of Yin descendants or races originally belonging to the Yin people into their own race slaves. He proved from the inscriptions on bronze ware that the direct producers "Zhongren" or "Shuren" at that time were some slaves who could be slaughtered or bought and sold at will. He has different interpretations of some phrases in the "Book of Songs" quoted by Fan Wenlan. He believes that "public fields" were the well-field system. The state divided the land into squares and granted them to the dukes, officials, and ministers, and at the same time distributed them to slaves for cultivation; the land reclaimed by the dukes, officials, and ministers outside the square fields by squeezing the surplus labor of the slaves was the so-called "private fields." Therefore, "Rain on my public fields, and then on my private fields" cannot be understood as farmers having their own land to use. Similarly, "Order my people, prepare your hoes and sickles, and inspect the weeding" cannot be understood as farmers having their own labor tools, because these words were spoken by the king to the field officials, "calling on the farmers to adjust the farming tools managed by the field officials." Regarding the issue of human sacrifice in Yin and Zhou, he believes that the Shang tombs in Anyang are the tombs of the Shang Dynasty emperors, while the Zhou tombs excavated by archaeologists are not the tombs of the Zhou Dynasty emperors. The nature of the two is different and cannot be compared, so it is impossible to draw the conclusion that the human sacrifice system was abolished in the Zhou Dynasty. (Guo Moruo: "The Era of Slavery," published by People's Publishing House.)
    Some other historians, based on Marxist theory about "ancient oriental society," believe that Western Zhou society, like the Yin Dynasty, had the characteristics of early slave society, that is, the development of productive forces was relatively low, patriarchal slavery and debt slavery, the number of slaves was relatively small, the main undertakers of social production were not slaves but free commune members, commodity-money relations were underdeveloped, the remnants of public ownership, autocratic rule, and the slow development of culture, etc. They believe that the enfeoffment system and similar systems are universal phenomena in early slave societies. It is a kind of tribal colonization system. The enfeoffed or naturally formed independent nobles are actually just some clan nobles. Their object of exploitation is slaves and commune members. When talking about the issue of human sacrifice, these historians believe that the reason why there were a large number of killings and sacrifices in the Shang Dynasty was because it was still in the stage of patriarchal slavery, and slaves were not very cherished; the reason why human sacrifice was opposed in the Eastern Zhou Dynasty proves that slave society had developed by that time, and the utility of slaves had increased.

    The second opinion: The turn of the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods was the beginning of feudal society
    Historians who advocate that the lower limit of slavery was at the turn of the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods include Guo Moruo, etc.
    Guo Moruo believes that the collapse of slavery can be found in the collapse of the well-field system. Because the public fields had to pay a certain tax to the public, while the private fields were initially completely tax-free, the acreage of private fields gradually exceeded that of public fields, and the private wealth gradually exceeded that of the public during the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods. The use of iron tools as farming tools greatly improved agricultural productivity and accelerated this process of quantitative change. Because private was richer than the public, the lower layers gradually surpassed the upper layers. In this struggle between the upper and lower layers, the lower layers had to try their best to win the support of the people as their fighters, and the status of the people gradually changed. The status of the main producers of society—"Shuren"—at least in the Jin state, at the end of the Spring and Autumn period, had been liberated from the status of slaves and became semi-free people. The liberation of the main producers of society from the status of slaves meant the collapse of slavery. The initial tax on fields in the fifteenth year of Duke Xuan of Lu showed that the state of Lu officially announced the abolition of the well-field system and established the landlord system. With the liberation of agricultural production, industry and commerce and the monetary system developed, usurers appeared, and large cities rose. Reflected in ideology, the views on "heaven" and "man" changed, and atheistic worldviews and the propositions of "benevolence," "compassion," "universal love," and "flooding love for all" appeared; private property rights began to be valued; the requirement of "rectification of names" occurred; the style of writing changed, the folk form was valued, and private writings appeared. (Ibid.)
    Ye Yuhua believes that the pre-feudal period when "farmers had not yet become serfs" in Chinese history roughly corresponds to the era before the Warring States period. At the end of the Spring and Autumn period, land could be privately owned and bought and sold, which made it possible to produce feudal-style serfs belonging to private individuals. When Shang Yang implemented the new law, the economic and legal status of the landlords was further consolidated. He believes that the Qin slave system was the most developed, so it became the center of the slave system crisis in the Warring States period, and it first developed the serf system. (Ye Yuhua: "The Feudalization Process of Warring States Society," contained in "Historical Research," Issue 1, 1956.)
    People who advocate that the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods were feudal society believe that the essence of social changes at that time was the transformation from the lord system to the landlord system within feudal society. Fan Wenlan said that during the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods, the clans of aristocratic lords collapsed due to annexation wars, and the peasant clans who inherited small pieces of land naturally became farmers or small landlords who obtained land ownership. In addition to other people who obtained land ownership, such as scholars, wasteland reclaimers, and merchants, the new landlord class and peasant class in the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods were formed. Yang Kuan believes that the "initial tax on fields" in the fifteenth year of Duke Xuan of Lu shows that labor rent began to transform into rent in kind; by the Warring States period, the basic antagonistic classes in the class struggle were the landlords and the peasants; the Legalists, who were the promoters of social changes in various countries at that time, their thoughts reflected the political reform requirements of the emerging landlord class. (Yang Kuan: "On the Promoting Role of Class Struggle in the Spring and Autumn and Warring States Periods on History," contained in "Literature, History and Philosophy," Issue 8, 1954.)
    Some other historians believe that during the Warring States period, the village commune began to disintegrate, land annexation and slave trade were rampant, the number of private slaves and production slaves increased, commodity-money relations developed, clan aristocratic slave owners gave way to industrial and commercial slave owners, cities rose, and the social economy prospered. All these phenomena should not have occurred in the early stage of feudal society. According to their opinion, the Warring States period was in the stage of transition from early slavery to developed slavery. In terms of ideology, the "swarming and simultaneous rise" of various schools of thought in the pre-Qin period also corresponds to the situation where the slave system economy initially obtained development.

    The third opinion: The lower limit of slavery was in the late Eastern Han Dynasty or the Wei and Jin Dynasties
    Historians who advocate including the Two Han dynasties in the era of slavery include Shang Yue and Wang Zhongluo, etc.
    Historians holding the above viewpoints believe that the main relations of production must be suitable for the nature of the productive forces, and all historical phenomena must be studied in conjunction with the economic structure of the society at that time. In the Two Han dynasties, various forms of production existed, but the existence and development of the slave system production form restricted the existence and development of other production forms. Slave labor occupied a dominant position in agriculture and handicrafts. In terms of handicrafts, for example, Zhang Anshi's "family had 700 servants, all of whom had skills in making things," and the Zhuo family's iron smelting industry had 1,000 slaves, etc.; in terms of agriculture, the number of manors based on slave labor can be proved by the number of fields and slaves confiscated by Emperor Wu due to the calculation of money, and many historical materials mentioned slaves and landlords together. Slaves could not only be freely bought and sold, but also the phenomenon of arbitrary abuse and killing was very common. During this period, the village commune had disintegrated, and the more developed slave system began to occupy a dominant position, guaranteeing the possibility of commodity production to a greater extent, and thus the unified empire of Qin and Han appeared. However, because the debt slave system was not abolished, the slave system in the Two Han dynasties did not develop to the typical stage like Greece and Rome. In the Two Han dynasties, slave owners, merchants, and usurers formed a trinity, manipulating actual production. Based on the slave system mode of production, what was produced was the irreconcilable class struggle between slaves and slave owners that filled the Two Han dynasties. This struggle became more complex and intense due to the increasing impoverishment of millions of small farmers and their falling into debt slavery. The decrees of the rulers of the Two Han dynasties concerning "releasing" and "prohibiting" abuse and killing of slaves and maids, and Wang Mang's "new policies" that violated social development, were essentially aimed at alleviating class contradictions and consolidating rule. These historians believe that it was only after Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty that feudal relations of production gradually sprouted and grew. (Shang Yue: "How to Understand Historical Figures, Events, and Phenomena," contained in "Teaching and Research," Issue 4, 1956. Wang Zhongluo: "On the Disintegration of Chinese Slave Society and the Formation of Feudal Relations," contained in "Literature, History and Philosophy," Issues 3, 4, and 5, 1956. Wang Sizhi et al.: "On the Exploration of the Social Nature of the Two Han Dynasties," contained in "Historical Research," Issue 1, 1955.)
    However, among the above historians, we also see that their views on individual issues are not completely consistent. For example, Shang Yue believes that the nature of the Han Empire's foreign wars was plunder wars, and therefore obtaining slaves and livestock was one of the main purposes of the war, while Wang Zhongluo does not think so.
    People who oppose that the Two Han dynasties were a slave society admit that there were still a large number of slaves in the Han Dynasty, but they believe that slaves were rarely or almost never used in the main department of social production—agriculture. At the same time, the slaves of the Two Han dynasties could no longer be killed at will. Jian Bozan believes that the number of official and private slaves in the Two Han dynasties accounted for a very small proportion of the population at that time; the main source of slaves was not foreigners captured in wars, but bankrupt farmers of the same race; no matter whether they were official or private slaves, they were not only not the main undertakers of social production, but also became a burden on the main producer, the farmers; finally, the laws of the Two Han dynasties were not laws that served the slave system. Based on these analyses, he believes that the official and private slaves of the Two Han dynasties were only remnants of the slave system in feudal society. (Jian Bozan: "On the Issue of Official and Private Slaves in the Two Han Dynasties," contained in "Historical Research," Issue 4, 1954.) Guo Moruo said that Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty respected Confucianism and firmly established the superstructure of feudal morality on the basis of the landlord economy, laying the foundation for the feudal pattern of the next two thousand years. If we acknowledge that Confucianism is a feudal theory, but argue that the relations of production in the Western Han Dynasty were still in the stage of slavery, wouldn't that be equivalent to saying that the superstructure of feudalism was established on the social basis of slavery?
    Above, we have only briefly introduced the propositions of various schools of thought and their main arguments in the discussion on the periodization of slavery and feudalism in China. Of course, many issues were involved in the discussion, and due to space limitations, they will not be introduced in detail.
    The discussion on the periodization issue shows that the historical circles have become active in the past few years. Although the opinions of historians on many issues seem so divergent, there are still many common views among them. For example, China went through the era of slavery, and the remnants of slavery still existed for a long time after the collapse of slave society, etc.
    There are also some shortcomings in the discussion. For example, some people understand the problem in a simplified and one-sided way, or still have certain dogmatic habits; some people lack necessary analysis when using historical materials, and have not paid more attention to underground excavated materials; in general, not enough attention has been paid to the study of the superstructure issues such as the state, rights, and ideology.
    To make the discussion further develop, it should be carried out in a more planned and step-by-step manner, and more scholars should be attracted to participate. For example, we know that some historians have made many contributions to the study of periodization issues in the past, but they have not yet published articles specifically discussing periodization issues since liberation; there are also some historians who have their own views on this issue and have mastered a lot of historical materials, but they have not yet published their opinions. Archaeologists and ethnologists have taken an insufficiently concerned attitude towards the discussion in the past, which is not good. We hope that the Institute of History of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the editorial board of Historical Research will undertake the task of leading and organizing the discussion. The "Historical Research" magazine should organize manuscripts in this area in a more planned manner, and should, at an appropriate time, initially summarize the gains and existing problems in the previous stage of the discussion. It is inappropriate that the journal has not published an editorial on the topic since the discussion of this issue began.
    We believe that with the rapid development of my country's scientific and cultural undertakings, historians' mastery and application of Marxist-Leninist theory will inevitably improve day by day. In addition, with the continuous discovery of new historical materials, under the correct guidance of the "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend" policy, this important historical topic will be solved within a certain period of time.

    关于中国历史上奴隶制和封建制分期问题的讨论
    江泉
    近几年来，中国历史上奴隶制和封建制分期问题的讨论，在史学界引起了广泛的注意。这个问题，很长时期以来一直是史学界十分关心和要求解决的重要问题之一。正确地解决中国奴隶社会和封建社会的分期，不仅对于中国古代史的研究有重要的意义，而且对于中国哲学史和其他专门史的研究都会有很大的帮助。同时，历史教学工作者在讲授西周到秦汉这一阶段的社会性质时，也将不再像现在一样感到混乱和困难。
    关于中国奴隶制和封建制的分期，我国史学界基本上有三种不同的意见：（一）认为自西周开始，已经进入封建社会；（二）认为西周还是奴隶社会，封建社会的开端是春秋战国之交（或是秦汉之际）；（三）认为汉代也是奴隶社会，把奴隶制的下限定在东汉末或魏晋时代。
    第一种意见：自西周起就已经进入封建社会
    主张封建社会开始于西周的史学家，有范文澜等。
    范文澜认为区别奴隶社会和封建社会的主要关键是“剥削方法的变换”，是“所有制的不同”；“至于生产工具制作的变化，在奴隶制向封建制的转化上，并不一定是决定性的”。根据这一分期标准，他认为周国在古公亶父时，已经出现了新的封建的生产关系。“因为周世世重农，周君从经验中知道鼓舞农夫们的生产兴趣是增强生产力的一个重要条件，他们对待农夫的态度，不像一般奴隶主对待奴隶那样残暴……这个经验的发展，就有可能把奴隶抛弃而宁愿利用农奴。”周之所以能灭商，正是因为新制度社会必然战胜旧制度社会。（范文澜：关于中国历史上的一些问题“第六节”“初期封建社会开始于西周”，载“中国科学院历史研究所第三所集刊”，第一集。“中国通史简编”修订本，第一编，第三章。）
    范文澜以及和他同一主张的史学家们，他们认为西周是封建社会的主要根据是，从“诗经”上“命我众人，庤乃钱镈，奄观铚艾”和“雨我公田，遂及我私”等词句看来，西周的生产者已经有了自己的劳动工具和实际上属于自己的土地。此外，他们还有自己的经济并且附着在土地上。他们以一部分时间在自己所使用的土地——“私田”上从事生产，而以另一部分时间在领主的土地——“公田”上从事生产。这种直接生产者的被榨取形态已是封建社会的被榨取形态。他们和殷代的奴隶不同，不能随便地被屠杀，这可以从商代有大批人殉而周代祭祀不用人得到证明（考古工作者发掘了一百五六十个西周东周的墓葬，仅发现三个墓葬里共有六个殉葬人）。这些史学家们还指出，西周的生产力状况所以看不出显著地超出殷代，这是因为封建制度并不是立刻就发挥出对于奴隶制度的优越性的。他们认为并没有什么理由一定要根据铁器的有无来判断封建社会是否存在。在谈到周初的大封建时，他们说这正表现了封建社会的土地所有权形态。基于这种分封制度之上的，是农民对于土地所有者的人身隶属关系和剥削阶级内部的严密的等级制度。所谓宗法制度，就是封建的上层建筑，对贵族领主说来这是一种加强统治的组织力量。在意识形态方面，西周至春秋时代统治阶级的口号是“以德和民”，“民”是指的“农民”，这正是不同于奴隶制的新的基础的反映。
    当然，主张西周是封建社会的史学家们的观点也并不是在一切问题上都一致的。例如，对于范文澜关于周初社会经济状况的估计，王玉哲等就提出了不同的意见。他们认为周族在克商以前还处在氏族社会的末期，无论就经济和文化的发展来说，都比殷族落后。周灭商并不是由于新的生产方式战胜旧的生产方式，而是由于商王国的奴隶制经济已经到了末路。周灭商后，在殷族奴隶制的废墟上，逐渐过渡到封建社会，这正和西欧日耳曼族摧毁罗马奴隶王国而过渡到封建社会相近。（王玉哲：“关于范著‘中国通史简编’修订本第一册的几点意见”，载“历史研究”，1954年第六期。）
    关于公田和私田，徐中舒，杨向奎等也和范文澜的解释不同。他们认为那是一种家族公社或农村公社的田制。在论述西周的封建制时，他们更多地从这方面进行了考察。徐中舒说，“私田”是公社成员的份田；统治者彻取公社的一部分土地，借助农民耕种，则称为“公田”。公田和私田有一定的比例，十比一或八比一。公社成员这种有一定比例的服役制，正是封建社会的劳役地租形态。他还指出，周人征服东方后，并不能改变当地的公社制度，而只能从村公社方面掠夺过去为公社占有的公地及公社成员在公地上的剩余劳动。统治者和他的部族居于国中，称“国人”；被统治的村公社共同体，称“野人”。国人和野人一直到春秋时代始终是身份不同的两个对立的集团。（徐中舒：“试论周代田制及其社会性质”，载“四川大学学报”，1955年第二期。）杨向奎认为在周代有两种不同的田制和不同的地租形态。“国人”居于乡遂，是自由农民的公社组织，行“贡”法，即向领主纳贡赋。“野人”居于都鄙，他们的身份是农奴，他们原来的公社组织已经破坏，而被统治者重新编排起来，在这里实行“助”法，即向领主提供劳役地租。他还特别强调了古代中国各地区发展的不平衡性。（杨向奎：“关于西周的社会性质问题”，载“文史哲”，1952年第五期。“有关中国古史分期的若干问题”，载“历史研究”，1956年第五期。）
    反对西周是封建社会的人，不同意上述这些史学家的意见。首先，他们批评范文澜关于分期标准的意见忽视了生产关系一定要适合生产力的性质的规律的作用。吴大琨提出，划分奴隶社会和封建社会的“唯一标准乃是当时社会的生产力与生产关系状况，而这二者原是密切结合而不能分割的。”
    （吴大琨：“关于西周社会性质问题的讨论”，载“历史研究”，1956年第三期）王忍之等虽然同意“区别两个社会形态的主要关键在于生产关系的不同”，但也认为“为了要全面、完整地区分两个相连的社会形态，就必须到生产关系与生产力的统一——即生产方式中去寻找”。（王忍之等：“对‘中国通史简编’的几点意见”，载“教学与研究”，1955年第三期。）其次，他们认为范文澜关于周初生产关系变化的说明是离开了社会物质生活条件，从个别人物的“经验”或“愿望”中去找寻社会发展的原因。他们说，既然西周还没有出现铁制工具，还不可能在生产力中引起巨大的变革，还不可能出现独立的个体生产，因此也就不能产生封建社会。吴大琨认为只有在奴隶社会内部产生了封建社会的生产力以后，才谈得到奴隶社会的崩溃和为封建社会所代替。他们还指出，不论那一种社会形态，当从它那里获得充分发展余地的那一些生产力还没有充分发展以前，是决不会死亡的。殷代奴隶制的生产力并没有得到充分的发展，因此就不能说殷代奴隶社会已经走到末路。对于王玉哲等把周灭商比拟为日耳曼族摧毁罗马帝国，他们也表示不同意。因为这二者情况有本质的不同，殷纣时，还处于家长奴隶制阶段，并不是什么“奴隶制的废墟”。
    郭沫若指出，左传定公四年记载武王克商以后，把“殷民六族”、“殷民七族”、“怀姓九宗”等分封给鲁公、康叔和唐叔，可见周人把殷遗民或原属于殷人的种族奴隶大批地化为自己的种族奴隶。他从金文中证明当时直接生产者“众人”或“庶人”都是一些可以随意屠杀或买卖的奴隶。对于范文澜所引用的“诗经”上的一些词句，他有不同的解释。他认为“公田”就是井田，公家把土地划成方块授予诸侯百官，同时分予奴隶为他们耕种；诸侯百官们在方田外榨取奴隶的剩余劳动所垦辟出的土地则是所谓“私田”。因此，“雨我公田，遂及我私”并不能理解为农民有自己使用的土地。同样的，“命我众人，庤乃钱镈，奄观铚艾”，也不能理解为农民有自己的劳动工具，因为这几句话是国王对田官们讲的，是“叫农人们调整好田官们所管理的耕具”。关于殷周殉人问题，他认为安阳的商墓是商代帝王的墓，而考古学者所发掘的周墓并非周代帝王的墓，二者性质不同，不能相比，因此也就不能得出周代废除人殉制度的结论。（郭沫若：“奴隶制时代”，人民出版社出版。）
    另一些史学家，他们根据马克思主义关于“古代东方社会”的学说，认为西周社会和殷代一样，具有早期奴隶社会的特征，即生产力的发展比较低下，家长奴役形式和债务奴役形式，奴隶数量比较地不大，社会生产的主要担当者不是奴隶而是自由的公社成员，商品货币关系不发达，公有制的残存，专制主义的统治，以及文化发展的迟缓等等。他们认为分封制及其类似的制度乃是早期奴隶制社会的普遍现象，它是一种部落殖民制，被分封或者自然形成的独立的贵族其实只是一些氏族贵族，他们剥削的对象是奴隶和公社成员。在谈到殉人问题时，这些史学家认为商代所以有大量的杀殉，那是因为当时还处在家长奴隶制阶段，对于奴隶是不甚爱惜的；殉葬到了东周之所以受了反对，正证明奴隶社会到那时候已经得到了发展，奴隶的效用增大了。
    第二种意见：春秋战国之交是封建社会的开端
    主张奴隶制的下限在春秋战国之交的史学家，有郭沫若等。
    郭沫若认为奴隶制的崩溃可以在井田制的崩溃中找到它的关键。由于公田要给公家纳一定的赋税，而私田最初却完全无税，所以井田制发展到了春秋战国时，私田亩积逐渐超过公田，私家财富逐渐超过公家。铁器作为耕器而使用，大大提高了农业生产力，更加速了这一量变的过程。由于私肥于公，下层便逐级超克上层。在这上下层相克的斗争中，下层者要尽力争取民众作为自己的战斗员，民众的身份也就逐渐改变了。社会的主要生产者——“庶人”的地位，至少在晋国，在春秋末年，已经从奴隶地位解放了出来，而成了半自由人。社会的主要生产者由奴隶身份解放了出来，这就意味着奴隶制的崩溃。鲁宣公十五年的初税亩，表明鲁国正式宣布废除井田制，确立了地主制度。随着农业生产的解放，工商业和货币制度都发展起来，高利贷者出现，大都市兴起。反映在意识形态上，对“天”和“人”的看法有了改变，出现了无神论的宇宙观和“仁”、“慈”、“兼爱”、“汛爱众”的主张；私有财产权开始被重视；发生了“正名”的要求；文体起了变化，民间形式被重视，有了私家著述。（同上）
    叶玉华认为“农民还没有变成农奴”的前封建时期，在中国史上大约相当于战国以前的时代。春秋末期土地可以私有和买卖，这就有可能产生了封建式的隶属于私人的农奴。到了商君行新法，更巩固了地主的经济地位和法律地位。他认为秦奴隶制最发达，因此成为战国时代奴隶制危机的中心，并且最先发展了农奴制。（叶玉华：“战国社会封建化过程”，载“历史研究”，1956年第一期。）
    主张春秋战国时代是封建社会的人，他们则认为当时社会变动的实质是封建社会内部领主制度向地主制度的转变。范文澜说，春秋战国时期，贵族领主的宗族因兼并战争而崩坏，世袭小块土地的农宗就很自然地变成获得土地所有权的农民或小地主。再加上其他获得土地所有权的人，如士、荒地开垦者、商人等，便形成春秋战国时期新起的地主阶级和农民阶级。杨宽认为鲁宣公十五年的“初税亩”说明劳役地租开始转变为实物地租；到战国时代，阶级斗争中基本的对抗阶级已是地主和农民；作为当时各国社会变革推动者的法家，其思想正反映了新兴地主阶级政治改革的要求。（杨宽：“论春秋战国间阶级斗争对于历史的推动作用”，载“文史哲”，1954年第八期。）
    另一些史学家，他们认为战国时代，村公社开始解体，土地兼并和奴隶买卖盛行，私有奴隶和生产奴隶增多，商品货币关系发展，氏族贵族奴隶主让位于工商业奴隶主，城市兴起，社会经济繁荣，所有这些现象都不是封建社会初期所应有的。按照他们的意见，战国时代正处在早期奴隶制向发达奴隶制过渡的阶段。在思想意识方面，先秦诸子百家学说的“蜂起并作”，也正和奴隶制经济初步获得发展的情况相符合。
    第三种意见：奴隶制的下限是在东汉末年或者魏晋时代
    主张把两汉划入奴隶制时代的史学家，有尚钺和王仲荦等。
    持上述观点的史学家们，他们认为主要的生产关系必须适合生产力的性质，一切历史现象必须和当时社会的经济结构结合起来研究。两汉时代在生产上存在着多种的形式，但是奴隶制生产形式的存在和发展制约着其他生产形式的存在和发展。奴隶劳动不论在农业上、手工业上都占着主导的地位。手工业方面，如张安世“家僮七百人，皆有手技作事”，卓氏铁冶业有奴隶千人等等；在农业方面，以奴隶劳动为基础的庄园之多，可以由武帝算缗钱没入的田地和奴隶数目以及很多史料中都把奴隶和田主并提得到证明。奴隶不仅可以自由买卖，而且随意虐杀的现象也很普遍。在这一时期，村公社已经瓦解，较发展的奴隶制开始占统治地位，在比较大的程度上保证了商品生产的可能性，因而出现了秦汉的统一大帝国。但由于债务奴隶制没有废除，两汉奴隶制并没有发展到像希腊、罗马那样的典型阶段。在两汉，奴隶主、商人、高利贷者形成了三位一体，操纵着实际生产。基于奴隶制生产方式所产生的，是充满两汉时代的奴隶和奴隶主之间不可调和的阶级斗争。这一斗争通过千百万小农的日益贫困，沦为债务奴隶而更加复杂和剧烈。两汉统治者有关“释放”和“禁止”虐杀奴婢的诏令，以及王莽违反社会发展的“新政”，其实质都是为了缓和阶级矛盾和巩固统治。这些史学家认为，只是在汉武帝以后，封建的生产关系才逐渐萌芽和成长起来。（尚钺：“如何理解历史人物、事件和现象，”载“教学与研究”，1956年第四期。王仲荦：“关于中国奴隶社会的瓦解及封建关系的形成问题”，载“文史哲”，1956年第三、四、五期。王思治等：“关于两汉社会性质问题的探讨”，载“历史研究”，1955年第一期。）
    但是，在上述史学家中间，我们也看到他们在个别问题上的观点并不完全一致。例如，尚钺认为汉帝国对外战争的性质是掠夺战争，因而获得奴隶和牲畜实为战争的主要目的之一，而王仲荦并不认为是这样。
    反对两汉是奴隶社会的人，他们承认汉代还有大量的奴隶存在，但是认为奴隶用于社会生产的主要部门——农业中的却很少或者几乎没有。同时，两汉的奴隶已经不能随便屠杀。翦伯赞认为，两汉官私奴婢的数量在当时人口中所占的比例极小；奴隶的主要来源不是战争中俘虏的外族人，而是本族的破产农民；不论官私奴婢，不仅不是社会生产的主要担当者，而且成为主要生产者农民的负担；最后，两汉的法律不是替奴隶制度服务的法律。根据这些分析，他认为两汉的官私奴婢只是封建社会中的奴隶制残余。（翦伯赞：“关于两汉的官私奴婢问题”，载“历史研究”，1954年第四期，）郭沫若说，汉武帝尊重儒家，在地主经济的基础上，把封建道德的上层建筑牢固地建立了起来，奠定了以后两千多年的封建格局。如果承认儒家学说是封建理论，却主张西汉的生产关系还在奴隶制阶段，那岂不等于说在奴隶制的社会基础上树立了封建制的上层建筑吗？
    上面我们只是很简单地介绍了中国奴隶制和封建制分期问题讨论中各家的主张和他们的主要论据。在讨论中涉及的问题当然还很多，因限于篇幅，就不详细介绍了。
    分期问题的讨论表明，史学界在几年来已经活跃起来。尽管史学工作者们对于很多问题的意见看起来是那么分歧，但是他们之间也还有不少共同的观点。例如，中国是经过了奴隶制时代的，奴隶制残余在奴隶社会崩溃以后仍然长期存在等等。
    在讨论中也存在着一些缺点。例如有的人把问题理解得简单化、片面化，或者还有着某些教条主义习气；某些人使用史料时缺乏必要的分析，还没有更多地重视地下发掘的材料；一般的对于研究国家、法权和意识形态这样一些上层建筑的问题还注意得不够等。
    要使得讨论进一步展开，应该更有计划有步骤地进行，应该吸引更多的学者们参加。例如我们知道，有些史学家过去对分期问题的研究有过不少贡献，但是在解放以后他们都还没有发表过专门论述分期问题的文章；还有一些史学家，他们在这个问题上有自己的看法，并且掌握了不少史料，但是也还没有把自己的意见发表出来。考古学家们和民族学家们过去对讨论采取不够关心的态度，这是不好的。我们希望，中国科学院历史研究所和历史研究编辑委员会把领导和组织讨论的任务担负起来。“历史研究”杂志要更有计划地组织这方面的稿件，并且要在适当的时候，初步总结前一阶段讨论的收获以及存在的问题，像该刊从开展这一问题的讨论以来没有发表过一篇有关的社论是不合适的。
    我们相信，随着我国科学文化事业的迅速发展，史学家们对马克思列宁主义理论的掌握和运用必然日益进步，加上新的史料的不断发现，在“百家争鸣”方针的正确指导下，这个重要的历史课题在一定时期内是能够得到解决的。
