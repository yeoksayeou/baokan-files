    Silkworm Eggs Transported to Mogan Mountain for Summer Heat Avoidance
    (Our Dispatch) Since the beginning of summer, the Hangzhou area has been very hot. The various joint state-private silkworm breeding farms in Hangzhou City are preparing to send all of the more than 60,000 sheets of silkworm eggs produced in the spring to Mogan Mountain, so that they can safely spend the hot summer.
    The maximum temperature required for silkworm eggs in summer should not exceed 90 degrees [Fahrenheit]. The highest temperature in Mogan Mountain in summer is only about 85 degrees [Fahrenheit]. This is very beneficial to improving the quality of silkworm eggs and ensuring high cocoon yields. Employees of the silkworm breeding farms said: Sending silkworm eggs to Mogan Mountain to escape the summer heat is something that could not be done in the past, but it has been achieved today.

    蚕种运莫干山避暑
    本报讯　入夏以来，杭州地区非常炎热，杭州市各公私合营蚕种场准备把春季生产的六万多张蚕种全部送往莫干山去，使它安全度过炎夏。
    夏季蚕种所需温度，最高不能超出90度，莫干山夏季最高温度只在85度左右。这对提高蚕种品质、保障蚕茧高额产量很有好处。各蚕种场职工说：送蚕种上莫干山避暑，这是过去办不到的事情，今天却办到了。　　　　　　（陈大良）
