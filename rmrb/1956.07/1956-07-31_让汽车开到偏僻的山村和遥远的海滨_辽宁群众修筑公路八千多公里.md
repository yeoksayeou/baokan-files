Xinhua News Agency dispatch: Liaoning Province farmers have built over 8,000 kilometers of local highways in mountain villages, beaches, and plains during the first half of this year. According to the person in charge of the Provincial Department of Transportation, the construction of these local highways has connected remote mountain villages and coastal areas in 42 cities and counties with major highways and railways.

The over one million farmers participating in road construction have shown great enthusiasm this year. They have converted over 4,200 kilometers of pack animal trails into roads suitable for large vehicles, enabling cars to reach mountainous areas traversing mountains and ridges, or distant coastal areas. Alongside the over 5,300 kilometers of roads, farmers have planted 3.42 million various trees.

The construction of local highways has already brought many benefits to the masses. Weigou Township in Fuxin County is a mountain village located in the branch of Yiwulü Mountain. The whole township has 160 hectares (15 *shi* mu per hectare) of orchards. Because of inconvenient transportation, the picked fruits could not be transported out, leaving about 100 hectares uncultivated. This year, a large vehicle road was built here, and the abundant harvest of fruits can now be sold. Beihai Village in Fuxian County is a fishing village. Fish and shrimp that could not be transported out in the past can now be transported out.

The person in charge of the Department of Transportation said that during the construction of these over 8,000 kilometers of local highways, farmers have deployed many vehicles and utilized over 830,000 cubic meters of sand and gravel materials along both sides of the roads, saving the state more than 340,000 yuan.

    让汽车开到偏僻的山村和遥远的海滨
    辽宁群众修筑公路八千多公里
    据新华社讯　辽宁省农民今年上半年在山村、海滩和平原修筑了八千多公里长的地方公路。省交通厅负责人说，这些地方公路的修筑，使四十二个市、县的偏僻山村、海滨和主要公路、铁路连接起来了。
    参加修路的一百多万农民今年修筑道路的热情非常高，他们把四千二百多公里的驮道修成了大车道，使汽车开到了盘山越岭的山区或遥远的海滨。在五千三百多公里的道路两旁，农民们栽植了三百四十二万棵各种树木。
    地方公路的修筑，已经给群众带来很多好处。阜新县苇沟乡是在翳巫闾山支脉里的一个山村，全乡有一百六十垧（每垧十五市亩）果园，因为交通不便利，摘下来的果子运不出去，荒芜了一百来垧。今年这里修了一条大车道，丰收的果子就有销路了。复县的北海村是一个渔村，过去运不出去的鱼虾，现在能运出去了。
    交通厅负责人说，在修筑这八千多公里地方公路的时候，农民们出动了很多车辆，利用沿路两侧砂石材料八十三万多立方公尺，为国家节省了三十四万多元。
