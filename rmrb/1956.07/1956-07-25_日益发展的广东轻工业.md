The light industry of Guangdong is developing rapidly.

In Guangdong, rice is harvested three times a year, mulberry leaves are produced seven or eight times a year, fruits are available in all seasons, and fresh flowers bloom all year round. According to Guangdong Province's seven-year agricultural construction plan, by 1962, the area of economic crops in the province will increase from the current seven million mu to more than twenty million mu. In order to fully utilize these rich and diverse agricultural raw materials, Guangdong Province plans to establish a series of light industrial factories to improve and beautify people's lives and accumulate more funds for heavy industry construction. This year, Guangdong Province plans to build, expand, and renovate more than 200 state-owned, locally state-owned, and jointly state-private factories.

    Building Twenty Sugar Refineries

Guangdong Province plans to build twenty modern sugar refineries this year. Among them, the state-owned Beijie, Yangjiang, Zhongshan, Nanhai, and the jointly state-private Overseas Chinese five factories, with a daily sugarcane crushing capacity of over 2,000 tons, will be completed in the next one to two years. The other fifteen factories will have daily sugarcane crushing capacities of 1,000 tons, 350 tons, and 100 tons, and they will all be put into production this year. After these twenty factories are completed, they can produce 1,600 tons of sugar per day.

The construction of the state-owned Beijie Sugar Refinery and the jointly state-private Overseas Chinese Sugar Refinery have received technical and equipment assistance from Poland and Czechoslovakia, respectively. Four experts from Czechoslovakia have already arrived on-site to help design the factory buildings for the Overseas Chinese Sugar Refinery.

The technical and management personnel needed for the new sugar refineries have been trained by state-owned and locally state-owned sugar refineries in the Guangdong area. (Xiang)

    The Largest Cannery in the Country

The largest state-owned Guangdong Cannery, with an annual output of 20,000 to 30,000 tons of various canned goods, will begin construction in Guangzhou in August and will be put into production in the fourth quarter of next year. To meet the cannery's need for glass bottles, Guangzhou will also build the largest glass bottle factory in the country.

Guangdong is rich in pineapples, oranges, lychees, tomatoes, peas, bamboo shoots, and cucumbers. After the Guangdong Cannery is completed, it will fully utilize these agricultural products to produce various canned goods to meet the needs of domestic and foreign markets and accumulate funds for socialist construction.

    Preparing to Build a High-Grade Fragrance Factory

A state-owned Guangzhou Fragrant Flower Extraction Factory, which manufactures high-grade fragrances, is being prepared for construction in Guangzhou and is expected to be completed in May next year.

Guangdong is known as the "Kingdom of Fragrances." "Grass does not wither in winter, and flowers compete in fragrance even when it is not spring." White orchids, roses, jasmine, pomelos, sweet oranges, and other fragrant flowers are everywhere. In the past, these fragrant flowers bloomed and withered on their own, and no one utilized them. After the Fragrant Flower Extraction Factory is completed, it will use these fresh flowers to extract various high-grade fragrances. In addition to meeting the needs of the Chinese people, these fragrances will also be sold abroad to earn foreign exchange.

In order to expand the source of fresh flower raw materials, Guangzhou is planning to open a large garden of 5,000 mu to plant various fragrant flowers. At that time, Guangzhou will become an even more beautiful and fragrant city. (Ye Xipei)

    Four Citronella Oil Factories

Guangdong Province is preparing to build four citronella oil factories on Hainan Island and the Leizhou Peninsula. They can all be put into production within the year.

These four factories will use a fragrant thatch unique to Hainan Island and the Leizhou Peninsula to extract the precious fragrance material – citronella oil. Now, farmers in Qiongshan County and Chengmai County on Hainan Island and Xuwen County on the Leizhou Peninsula are making full use of wasteland to expand the planting area of citronella grass. Citronella grass can be harvested four times a year, with a yield of about 1,800 jin per mu, and each 100 jin can extract 19-22 liang of citronella oil. (Xiang)

    日益发展的广东轻工业
    在广东，粮食一年三收，桑叶年产七、八造，水果四季不断，鲜花终年盛开。根据广东省七年农业建设规划，到1962年，全省经济作物的面积将由现在的七百万亩发展到二千多万亩。为了充分利用这丰富多样的农业原料，广东省准备建立一系列的轻工业工厂，来改善和美化人民的生活，和为重工业建设积累更多的资金。今年，广东省就计划新建、扩建、改建二百多个国营、地方国营和公私合营工厂。
    新建二十个糖厂
    广东省今年计划兴建二十个现代化糖厂。其中国营北街、阳江、中山、南海和公私合营华侨五个厂，每天榨蔗二千吨以上，将分别在明、后年建成。另外十五个厂的日榨蔗量，有一千吨的，有三百五十吨的，也有一百吨的，它们都将在今年投入生产。这二十个厂建成以后，每天可以生产食糖一千六百吨。
    国营北街糖厂和公私合营华侨糖厂的建设，都分别得到波兰和捷克斯洛伐克在技术方面、设备方面的帮助。捷克斯洛伐克的四位专家，已经到现场帮助华侨糖厂设计厂房。
    新建糖厂所需要的技术人员和管理人员，已经由广东地区的国营、地方国营糖厂负责培养。　（祥）
    全国最大的罐头厂
    规模最大的年产各种罐头二万到三万吨的国营广东罐头厂，八月份将在广州市动工兴建，明年第四季度投入生产。为了满足罐头厂对玻璃瓶的需要，广州还将建设一个全国最大的玻璃瓶厂。
    广东盛产菠萝、桔子、荔枝、番茄、碗豆、竹笋、黄瓜。广东罐头厂建成以后，将充分利用这些农产品来生产各种罐头，以满足国内外市场的需要，为社会主义建设积累资金。　（叶锡培）
    筹建高级香料工厂 
    一个制造高级香料的国营广州香花浸提厂，正在广州筹建，预计明年五月就可以建成。
    广东有“众香之国”之称。“草经冬而不枯，花非春而竞芳”。白兰、玫瑰、茉莉、柚子、甜橙等香花到处都是。但在过去，这遍地香花自开自谢，没人加以利用。香花浸提厂建成之后，将利用这些鲜花提炼各种高级香料。这些香料除满足我国人民需要，还将运销国外，换回外汇。
    为了扩大鲜花原料的来源，广州正计划开辟一个面积五千亩的大花园，种植各种香花。那时候，广州将变成一个更加美丽和充满芳香的城市。　（叶锡培）
    四个香茅油厂
    广东省正在海南岛和雷州半岛筹建四个香茅油厂。它们在年内都可以投入生产。
    这四个工厂将利用海南岛和雷州半岛特有的一种具有香味的茅草来提炼名贵的香料——香油。现在，海南岛的琼山县、澄迈县和雷州半岛的徐闻县农民，正充分利用荒地扩大香茅草的种植面积。香茅草每年可以收获四次，每亩产量一千八百斤左右，每百斤可以提炼十九——二十二两香茅油。　（祥）
