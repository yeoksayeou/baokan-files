    The Newborn Sisters Are Advancing
    By our reporter Zhou Huizhi
    Some readers familiar with the situation in Beijing wrote to say: Before liberation, wild prostitutes and secret prostitutes were everywhere in parks, restaurants, and alleys in Tianqiao, Huashi, and other places. The first- and second-class establishments concentrated in the Eight Great Hutongs outside Qianmen were even more chaotic, and a large number of women groaning under the prostitution system were truly miserable. After liberation, the government rescued them. What is their situation now? To this end, the reporter visited relevant personnel, who introduced in detail the process and current situation of the transformation of prostitutes in Beijing:
    On November 21, 1949, the Beijing Municipal People's Government closed 237 brothels in the city, allowing 1,286 prostitutes to see the light of day again. A re-education center was specially established to help them transform their thinking and treat venereal diseases. After more than half a year of education and training, by July 1950, nearly 600 people had been discharged and married workers, farmers, shop assistants, vendors, etc., about 400 people were taken home by their parents and brothers, more than 60 people participated in medical, drama, and other work, and more than 200 people who had nowhere to go were left behind. The government bought 82 looms and established a New Life Weaving Factory to organize them to learn weaving.
    After the brothels were closed, the public prostitutes disappeared, but the wild prostitutes who loitered in parks and restaurants had not stopped their activities. In the winter of 1952, the Beijing Municipal People's Committee established a production and re-education center, and successively took in more than 150 wild prostitutes for centralized re-education. Later, 80 sewing machines were purchased to organize a Forward Sewing Factory, which ended before May Day this year. More than 30 of these people went to a state-owned farm garment factory in Northeast China to work as garment workers, more than 40 people joined various sewing production cooperatives in Beijing, and the rest have either married or gone home.
    The more than 1,400 prostitutes left over from old Beijing have now found their places. Some are advanced workers, some are collective farmers, some are housewives, and some are revolutionary cadres. Most of them have started families, established careers, and given birth to children. Now, let me introduce the specific situations of several newborn sisters to the readers who care about them.
        An Advanced Producer
    In the first workshop of a dye weaving factory in Beijing, a young female worker is nimbly walking around five looms. She seems not to see the guests standing next to the machines, and she doesn't even say hello. This female worker is a production expert in this factory, a labor model in Beijing, and an advanced producer in the national textile industry. She is now trying out the advanced experience she learned from the conference of advanced producer representatives in the workshop.
    She is very clever at work, but speaks like a country girl in the old society, especially when talking about her personal experiences, she has even less to say. In order to further understand her situation, I visited the chairman of the factory's trade union. The chairman of the trade union is also a very simple young woman, very straightforward and generous. The chairman of the trade union said to me: "You see! That's how she is in her work attitude, diligent and responsible, with excellent labor discipline. In the past two or three years, she has not only never been absent, but even never been late or left early. Last year, the production and quality of cotton cloth were all completed ahead of schedule and overfulfilled the state plan, and balanced production was maintained, so she was rated as a labor model in Beijing, and not long ago she was selected as an advanced producer in the national textile industry. You saw that she was very busy in the workshop, didn't you? After the conference of advanced producer representatives, she is now taking care of one more loom!" "Don't think she doesn't talk much, but she is very sincere to people, and even more enthusiastic in helping people, so everyone likes her very much." The chairman of the trade union then smiled and said: "This is not very remarkable, but according to the specific situation here, it is indeed not simple."
    What is the specific situation here? The factory has old machines, poor equipment, short worker seniority, and low technology. This factory originally belonged to the Beijing Women's Production and Re-education Institute, and most of the female workers were liberated from brothels. Under such circumstances, it is indeed not easy to create such achievements!
    The topic turned to the comrades who came from the re-education center, and the chairman of the trade union pointed to the five photos on the honor roll and said to me: "Look, those are the five labor models in our factory. Except for one man, the other four are all from the re-education center. Young, enthusiastic, and quick to accept new things are their main characteristics." The chairman of the trade union became more and more energetic as she spoke, and she counted her fingers and said:
  "Among the more than 80 female workers in our first workshop, 63 were liberated from brothels. Now, more than 20 of these 63 people have been rated as advanced producers in the factory, and there are more than a dozen members of the Communist Youth League and seven members of the Communist Party." A few years ago, they were still afraid of labor and did not understand production, but now they have all become workers and labor models. This is so exciting!
      The Tragic Life of the Trade Union Chairman
    The trade union chairman mentioned above is only twenty-three years old this year, but like all the sisters liberated from brothels, she has a long and painful experience and a tragic life. Her hometown is in the countryside of Shanghai, and her father was a very honest farmer. When she was five years old, her family was destroyed by Japanese artillery fire, and she fled with her parents to the countryside of Suzhou. When she was nine years old, her family could not repay the debt and gave her to the landlord's family as a maid.
    When she was fourteen years old, the landlord took her to Beijing and sold her to the boss of Xinya Pavilion—the famous "Tiger Mother." From then on, her life became even more miserable, with no freedom at all. She had to watch the boss's face when eating, and being beaten and scolded was commonplace. Once, she was severely beaten by the "Tiger Mother" and could not get up for several days. She spent two long years in the brothel in this way until she was freed after liberation.
    In the spring of 1950, she went to Qinghe Woolen Mill to learn weaving. It was the first time she saw such a large factory, so many workers, and everyone helping and caring for each other so much. This made her feel infinite warmth, and she was determined to become a working person. Soon, she went to work in the weaving factory and joined the trade union. Later, she engaged in production while doing trade union work. In 1953, she joined the Communist Youth League, in 1954, she joined the Communist Party, and was elected as a labor model in Beijing. In March 1955, she left production and became the chairman of the factory's trade union. During this stage, her cultural level also increased from being illiterate to the level of junior high school. In the high tide of socialist transformation in Beijing, this factory merged with fourteen private small factories. Now, this factory has four workshops and more than 300 workers. The task of the trade union chairman is of course even heavier, but she did not show any timidity. She has made a plan to do the trade union work even better.
          Unexpected Joy
    In a courtyard on Dongsi Sixth Alley in Beijing, a middle-aged woman diligently manages her household chores every day. This is another newborn sister. She wandered in the red-light district for thirteen years, and this year she is pregnant, which is really an unexpected joy. She is thirty-one years old this year. When she was fourteen years old, her father, who was not engaged in honest work, sold her to a brothel. After she came to Beijing at the age of sixteen, the boss taught her to smoke opium and eat heroin. Soon, she became addicted to both opium and heroin, and at the same time contracted venereal disease. At the age of twenty-one, she gave birth to a child, but the child's body ulcerated after birth and died in less than three months. Her opium addiction and illness became more and more serious. By the time of liberation, she was already emaciated and deeply infected with the virus. After arriving at the re-education center, she first quit opium and then treated her illness. In the past few years, she has had more than 100 injections of oil-based penicillin and took more than half a year of traditional Chinese medicine continuously. Finally, she cured her illness last year and got married, but no one had ever thought about having children again.
    This spring, the news suddenly spread that she was pregnant. The female workers of the Forward Sewing Factory disbelievingly said: Hey! She can have children, only God knows. But her belly really did grow bigger day by day, and everyone was extremely happy. They all said: If it weren't for the Communist Party, this "she" would have been gone from the world long ago, so what's there to talk about having children! Everyone took care of her in every possible way, and wouldn't let her do any work that was even slightly heavy. Now she is more than seven months pregnant and is preparing children's clothes at home.
    Like her medical treatment, her ideological transformation has also gone through many difficulties. She also hated the brothel life at first and hoped that someone could take her out, but every time she went out, she was sold again. She was sold five or six times in total. After suffering all kinds of deception and humiliation, she no longer believed in anyone and became accustomed to putting on a false face to greet people. Over time, her mind was numbed, and her will was corroded. On the contrary, she became reluctant to give up that kind of loose and degenerate life. Therefore, not long after leaving the re-education center for the first time, she secretly mixed with wild prostitutes again until she was transformed after the second re-education. Now, she is not only a healthy woman, but also a very good housewife, managing the household affairs in an organized manner. In less than two months after returning home, she learned to wash clothes, cook, and how to live a life. There are three people in her family who work outside. Usually, when there are few people at home, they eat simply. On Sundays, when the whole family gathers, they make a few good dishes to make everyone comfortable. There is also a nine-year-old child left behind by her husband's ex-wife who has to cross a large road to go to school every day, and she personally picks her up and drops her off every day. She also personally made shirts, pants, and shoes for this child. Her family does not discriminate against her, and the family lives in harmony.
    These newborn sisters are advancing happily in the new life like this!

    新生的姊妹在前进
    本报记者　周慧之
    有些熟悉北京情况的读者来信说：解放前公园、饭店以及天桥、花市等地小巷中，到处都有野妓和暗娼。头二等班子集中地——前门外八大胡同更是乌烟瘴气，呻吟在娼妓制度下的一大批妇女真是苦不堪言。解放后，政府将她们解救出来，现在她们的情况怎样了呢？记者为此曾走访了有关人员，她们详细地介绍了北京市妓女改造的经过和现状：
    1949年11月21日，北京市人民政府封闭了市内237家妓院，使1，286名妓女重见天日。并专门成立一个教养院，帮助她们改造思想，医治性病。经过半年多的教育训练以后，到1950年7月止，便有近六百人出院同工人、农民、店员、摊贩等结了婚，约四百人被父母兄弟领回家，六十多人参加医务、戏剧等工作，留下无处可去的二百多人，由政府买了八十二台织布机、成立一个新生织布工厂，组织她们学习织布。
    妓院封闭后，公开的妓女没有了，但蹓公园、串饭店的野妓还没有停止活动。北京市人民委员会在1952年冬季成立了生产教养所，又先后收容野妓一百五十多名，集中教养。后来又买了八十台缝纫机组织了一个前进缝纫工厂，直到今年“五一”以前，这个工厂才结束。这批人中有三十多人到东北一个国营农场被服厂里当被服工人去了，四十多人参加了北京市各个缝纫生产合作社，其余都已结婚或回家去了。
    旧北京遗留下的一千四百多个妓女，现在都已各得其所。有的是先进工人，有的是集体农民，有的是家庭主妇，有的是革命干部，她们大都成家立业、生男育女。现在，再向关心她们的读者介绍一下几位新生姊妹的具体情况。
        一位先进生产者
    北京市某染织厂的第一车间里，有一位青年女工行动敏捷地巡回在五台布机中间，对于站在机旁参观的客人，她好像没有看见似的，连一声招呼都没有。这位女工是这个厂里的生产能手，是北京市的劳动模范，还是全国纺织工业中的先进生产者。现在她正在车间试行着从先进生产者代表会议上学来的先进经验。
    她工作起来很机灵，说话时却像旧社会里的乡下姑娘一样，特别是谈到她个人事迹时，更加无话可讲。为了进一步了解她的情况，我访问了这个厂的工会主席。工会主席也是一位很朴实的女青年，很爽快，直率、大方。工会主席对我说：“看见了吧！她的劳动态度就是这样，勤勤恳恳，认真负责，劳动纪律很好，两三年以来不仅没有一次缺勤，就连迟到早退也没有过。去年棉布产质量全部提前超额完成国家计划，并且保持均衡生产，因此被评为北京市的劳动模范，不久前又被选为全国纺织工业的先进生产者。你不是看见她在车间里很紧张吗？先进生产者代表会议以后，她又多看了一台布机啦！”“你莫看她不多说话，待人却很真诚，帮助人更是热情，因此大家都很喜爱她。”工会主席接着笑笑说：“这本来也没有什么了不起，不过根据我们这里的具体情况来看，的确也就不简单了。”
    什么是这儿的具体情况呢？厂里机器老，设备差，工人工龄短，技术低。这个厂原来是属于北京市妇女生产教养院的，大部女工都是从妓院里解放出来的。在这样的情况下，创造了这样的成绩，确实也不太容易啊！
    话题转到从教养院来的同志的身上去了，工会主席指着光荣榜上的五张照片对我说：“你看，那是我们厂里的五位劳动模范，除去一个男的，其余四个都是从教养院出来的。年轻，热情，接受新鲜事物快，这是她们的主要特点。”工会主席越说越有劲，越谈越高兴，她数着指头说：
  “我们一车间八十多名女工中有六十三名是从妓院里解放出来的，现在这六十三人中已有二十多个被评为厂里的先进生产者。并有十几个青年团员，七个中共党员。”几年前还是畏惧劳动、不懂生产的人，现在一下都变成了工人、劳动模范，这是多么令人兴奋的事情啊！
      工会主席的悲惨身世
    前面所说的这位工会主席，今年才二十三岁，但和其他所有从妓院解放出来的姊妹一样，有着很长一段痛苦的经历和悲惨的身世。她的老家在上海的乡下，父亲是一个很老实的农民。她五岁时，家庭被日军炮火破坏，便随着父母逃难到苏州乡下，到九岁时，家里因无力偿还债款，把她顶给地主家当使女。
    十四岁那年，地主又把她带到北京卖给鑫雅阁老板——有名的母老虎，从此生活就更加悲惨，没有一点自由，吃饭时看老板的脸色，挨打受骂更是家常便饭，有一次被母老虎痛打一顿，睡了几天才能起身，她就这样在妓院中度过了漫长的两年，直到解放后才脱离苦海。
    1950年春季，她到清河制呢厂学习织布，她第一次看到这样大的工厂，这么多的工人，大家那么的互相帮助、互相关怀，这使她感到无限温暖，便下决心做一个劳动人民。不久便到织布厂做工，参加了工会，以后一面生产，一面做工会工作，1953年参加青年团，1954年参加了共产党，并当选为北京市劳动模范，1955年3月脱离生产，担任厂里的工会主席。在这一阶段中，她的文化程度也从一字不识提高到初中水平。北京市社会主义改造高潮中，这个厂又和十四个私营小厂进行合并，现在这个厂共有四个车间、三百多名工人，工会主席的任务当然也就更加繁重，但她并没表示畏缩，她已做出计划，要把工会工作做得更好。
          意外的喜事
    北京市东四六条的一个院落里，一位中年妇女每天勤谨地操持着家务，这又是另外一个新生的姊妹。她在烟花巷里流落了十三年，今年怀了孩子，真是出人意料之外的喜事。她今年三十一岁，十四岁那年被不务正业的父亲卖到妓院里，十六岁到北京后，老板就教她抽大烟，吃白面，不久烟毒都有了瘾，同时又染上花柳病。二十一岁那年曾生过一个小孩，小孩生下后身上就溃烂，不到三个月便死了。她烟毒病害日甚一日，到解放时已经形容枯槁，病毒很深。到教养院以后，首先戒了烟，接着就治病。几年来光是油质盘尼西林就打了一百多针，又连续吃了半年多的中药，终于在去年把病治好了，并结了婚，但是关于再生孩子的事情谁都不曾想到过。
    今年春天，忽然传出了她怀孕的消息，前进缝纫工厂的女工们都不相信地说：嘿！她能生孩子，真是天知道。但是，她的肚子却一天天真的大起来了，大家可高兴极啦，都说：要不是共产党，世界上早已没有这个她了，还谈什么生孩子呀！大家对她百般照顾，稍微重一点的活就不让她干。现在她已经怀孕七个多月，正在家里准备小孩衣服。
    和治病一样，她的思想改造也是经历了很多难关的。她当初也讨厌妓院生活，希望有人能把她接出去，但是出去一次就被串卖一次，先后共被人串卖了五、六次。受尽百般欺骗和凌辱之后，她不再相信任何人，自己也习惯于假脸迎人了。久而久之，思想被麻痹，意志被腐蚀，对于那种散漫、堕落的生活，反而恋恋不舍。因之在第一次离开教养院以后不久，便又偷偷混起野妓来了，直到经过第二次教养，才改造过来。她现在不仅是一个健康的妇女，而且是一个很好的家庭主妇，家务管理得有条有理。她回家不到两个月已学会洗衣、做饭和怎样过日子，她家有三个人在外工作，平时家里人少就吃得简单些，星期日全家聚会，便做几样好菜让大家吃得舒服些。家里还有她丈夫的前妻留下的一个九岁小孩，每天上学都要经过大马路，她每天都亲自接送。并且还亲自动手替这个孩子做了衬衫、裤子和鞋子。家里人对她也不歧视，家庭过得很融和。
    这些新生的姊妹，就是这样愉快地在新生活中不断前进！
