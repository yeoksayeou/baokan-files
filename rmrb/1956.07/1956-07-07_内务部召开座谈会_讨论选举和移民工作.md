Xinhua News Agency, July 6th. The Ministry of Internal Affairs of the People's Republic of China recently held a symposium in Beijing on election and immigration work.

This symposium discussed several issues related to the 1956 grassroots elections and also exchanged and summarized experiences in immigration work from various regions.

The symposium believed that this election is being held during the high tide of China's socialist revolution. Through this election, all the people and "all cadres can receive a profound education under the scrutiny of the people," thereby further stimulating their enthusiasm to participate in the country's socialist construction and national management. This is why it is necessary to fully promote democracy, carry out mass criticism and self-criticism, review the work of the government, and conduct a review of the original representatives and cadres to improve government work. In this way, this election will also replenish the state power organs with a new force. To this end, all regions must strengthen their leadership over election work, properly arrange the timing and steps of the election work, and do a good job in preparing for the establishment of institutions, the adjustment of district and township administrative divisions, the proper division of electoral districts, and the review of voter qualifications.

In order to ensure that voters can fully and freely express their will, the symposium believed that in townships that meet the conditions, secret ballot methods can be used to replace the method of raising hands for elections. The symposium also discussed the system of elected people's representatives maintaining fixed contact with voters and the consolidation and improvement of grassroots political power organizations and systems in conjunction with elections.

Regarding immigration work, the symposium pointed out that this year is the first year of planned large-scale immigration work, and various regions have achieved many results despite insufficient experience. Between provinces (autonomous regions, municipalities) and within provinces, more than 330,000 people have been relocated in the first half of this year. In addition, five provinces have relocated more than 100,000 people within their provinces. These immigrants have reclaimed large tracts of wasteland in various places. In Heilongjiang Province alone, more than 110,000 hectares have been reclaimed in 40 counties. The symposium believes that immigration work will be a long-term and important task, and will be of great significance for promoting the balanced development of economic and cultural undertakings in various regions of China, increasing grain production, and prospering sparsely populated areas.

The symposium pointed out that due to the arduousness and complexity of immigration work, various regions should determine immigration tasks according to needs and possibilities in the future, and should strictly adhere to the principle of voluntarism. Both the emigration areas and the resettlement areas should conscientiously do all necessary preparatory work, and should conscientiously implement ethnic policies and pay attention to the unity of immigrants and the original residents of the resettlement areas. For the immigrants who have already been resettled this year, we must vigorously organize them to carry out production and strive to complete the land reclamation task within this year according to the original plan; strengthen the ideological education of immigrants, and earnestly solve some of their difficulties in production and life.

This symposium was held from June 21st to June 30th.

    内务部召开座谈会
    讨论选举和移民工作
    新华社6日电　中华人民共和国内务部在最近在北京召开了选举和移民工作座谈会。
    这个座谈会讨论了1956年基层选举工作的若干问题，还交流和总结了各地移民工作的经验。
    座谈会认为，这次选举是在我国社会主义革命高潮中举行的。通过这一次选举，将使全国人民和“所有干部都能在人民的鉴别下受到一次深刻的教育”，从而更加激发起参加国家的社会主义建设和国家管理的积极性。这就是应该充分发扬民主，开展群众性的批评和自我批评，检查政府的工作，对原有的代表和干部进行一次鉴别，以改进政府工作。这样，通过这一次选举也将给国家政权机关补充一批新生力量。为此，各地必须加强对选举工作的领导，妥善安排选举工作的时间和步骤，并且做好建立机构、调整区乡行政区划、划分好选区、审查好选民资格等准备工作。
    为了保证选民能充分地自由地表达自己的意志，座谈会上认为，在具备条件的乡可以用无记名投票的方法来代替举手的选举方法。座谈会还讨论了当选的人民代表固定联系选民的制度和结合选举整顿、健全基层政权的组织、制度等问题。
    关于移民工作，座谈会上指出，今年是有计划地大规模地进行移民工作的第一年，各地都在经验不足的情况下取得了许多成绩。在省（自治区、直辖市）和省之间，今年上半年已经移民三十三万多人，此外有五个省的省内移民十万多人。这些移民在各地开垦了大片荒地。仅黑龙江省的四十个县已开垦出十一万多公顷。座谈会认为，移民工作将是一项长期的重要任务，对促进我国各个地区经济、文化事业的平衡发展和增产粮食、繁荣地广人稀的地区将有重要的意义。
    座谈会指出，由于移民工作的艰巨性和复杂性，今后各地应该根据需要和可能来确定移民任务，并且要切实遵守自愿的原则。移出地区和安置地区都应当认真作好各项必要的准备工作，并且应当认真执行民族政策和注意移民同安置地区原有居民的团结。对今年已经安置的移民要大力组织他们进行生产，争取按原计划在今年内完成开荒任务；加强对移民的思想教育工作，并且要切实解决他们的生产、生活上的某些困难问题。
    这次座谈会是在六月二十一日到六月三十日举行的。
