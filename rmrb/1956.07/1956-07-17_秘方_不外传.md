    "Secret Formulas" Not to Be Passed On
    Cheng Ji
    On July 4th, the Jilin Daily published an article exposing an incident of unwillingness to disseminate advanced experience: Two comrades from the Beijing Asbestos Factory traveled two thousand miles to study advanced experience at the Liuhe Asbestos Factory in Jilin Province. This advanced experience had been introduced by advanced producers from Jilin Province at the National Conference of Advanced Producers. The Jilin Provincial Department of Industry issued them a letter of introduction, allowing them to study at the Liuhe Asbestos Factory.
    They happily arrived at their destination, only to be met with a cold reception. Xin Zhiyue, the deputy director of the Liuhe Asbestos Factory, stipulated that they were "only allowed to watch, not allowed to record," and could only study rubber technology, but not advanced experience such as raw material formulas. These two comrades felt very strange and said, "We can also study rubber technology in Beijing. We came here to learn advanced experience." They also hoped to communicate with Deputy Director Xin again. However, Deputy Director Xin brushed them off, repeatedly saying, "I don't have time." The two comrades earnestly requested that Deputy Director Xin allow them to see some blueprints and other technical materials. Although the technical materials they wanted to see had no secrets whatsoever, Deputy Director Xin still put on a stern face and said, "To see blueprints, you need to go through the Central Government... or through the public security department."
    The two comrades had no choice but to "watch" around the factory and, unable to learn any advanced experience, returned to Beijing in disappointment.
    This story vividly portrays Deputy Director Xin with a face as unwilling to disclose technical secrets as a capitalist. Of course, it would be wrong to say that this deputy director was sincerely learning from the capitalists. However, if we say that this deputy director was influenced by bourgeois ideology, it would not be an exaggeration at all. He believed that the advanced experience created by his factory could only be used by his own factory and could not be disseminated to the outside world. If it were spread out, and others learned it, they would catch up with him. In that case, wouldn't it be detrimental to the interests of his own factory!
    In our working class's dictionary, there are no words like "secret formulas not to be passed on," because there is no conflict of interest between our enterprises. Therefore, many leading staff members of enterprises warmly receive people from fraternal enterprises who come to learn advanced experience; many advanced producers sacrifice their holidays and help others everywhere in order to spread the advanced experience they have created, wishing they could teach others all at once and hoping that others would quickly catch up with them. Comparing this with Deputy Director Xin's behavior, one can see how despicable this comrade's behavior is!

    “秘方”不外传
    成集
    七月四日，吉林日报刊登了一篇文章，揭露一件不肯传播先进经验的事情：北京市石棉厂两位同志，走了两千里地，要到吉林省柳河石棉厂学习先进经验。这些先进经验是吉林省先进生产者在全国先进生产者代表会议上介绍过的。吉林省工业厅开了介绍信，让他们到柳河石棉厂去学习。
    他们欢天喜地来到目的地，碰到的却是冷眼相待。柳河石棉厂副厂长辛志悦规定他们“只许观看，不许记录”，只能学习橡胶工艺学，不能学习原料配方等先进经验。这两位同志感到很奇怪，说道：“橡胶工艺学，我们在北京也能学习。我们到这里来是学习先进经验的。”他们还希望跟辛副厂长再通融一番。但是辛副厂长把袖子一甩，连说：“没有时间。”这两位同志又恳切地要求辛副厂长能够准许他们看些图纸等技术资料。虽然他们所要看的技术资料丝毫没有什么秘密可言，但是辛副厂长仍然扳起面孔，说道：“要看图纸，需要通过中央……或者通过公安部门。”
    这两位同志无可奈何，只好在厂内“观看”一番，没有能学到先进经验，失望地返回北京了。
    这个故事，活画出辛副厂长一幅和资本家一样不肯公开技术秘密的面孔。当然，要是说这位副厂长是在诚心诚意地学资本家的样子，那是冤枉了他。但是，如果说这位副厂长受了资产阶级的思想影响，倒是一点也不过分。他以为自己工厂创造的先进经验只能由本厂使用，不能向外传播。万一传播出去，别人学会了，就要赶上自己。这样一来，岂不有损于自己工厂的利益！
    在我们工人阶级的字典里，是找不出“不外传秘方”的字样的，因为我们企业之间没有利害的冲突。因而许多企业的领导工作人员，热情地招待来自兄弟企业学习先进经验的人；许多先进生产者为了传播自己创造的先进经验，牺牲假日，到处把着手帮助别人，恨不得一下子把别人教会，希望别人也很快地赶上自己。这和辛副厂长的行为比较一下，就更可看到这个同志的行为是多么卑劣了！
