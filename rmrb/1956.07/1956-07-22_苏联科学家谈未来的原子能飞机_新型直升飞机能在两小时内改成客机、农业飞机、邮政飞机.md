Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, July 21st. Soviet Doctor of Technical Sciences, Pokrovsky, recently told a “Literary Gazette” reporter that future atomic-powered aircraft will be equipped with a light atomic reactor, its capacity at least ten times greater than the reactor of the Soviet Union's first atomic power station. The non-stop flight distance of an atomic-powered aircraft will be roughly equal to the distance around the Earth. Atomic-powered aircraft will appear in the near future.

Answering a “Literary Gazette” reporter's question about what atomic-powered aircraft will look like in 1966, Pokrovsky said that the airports for atomic-powered aircraft will be very small, with the planes parked almost side by side. Their streamlined fuselage will look very light, the fuselage very long, the cabin moved far forward, and the delta wings and two jet engines extended behind. When passengers enter the cabin, they will see that the wings rotate together with the engines, the axis of the engines being vertical. When the plane takes off, the thrust of the engines is greater than the weight of the plane, and the plane rises into the sky like an ordinary rocket. After flying to a certain altitude, the position of the plane's wings and engines gradually becomes parallel to the ground. When the plane is about to land, the fuselage turns into a vertical state again, the plane gradually reduces speed, and the plane can then land easily.

Pokrovsky concluded by saying that in our era, reality often exceeds fantasy. It is conceivable that the actual atomic-powered aircraft of 1966 will be more perfect and simpler than we think now.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, July 21st. Soviet aircraft designer Mil recently announced that the Soviet Union is manufacturing a new type of helicopter, which can be converted into any of the following types of aircraft in two hours according to needs: passenger plane, agricultural plane, postal plane, and medical plane.

Future helicopters can be used to transport timber in mountainous areas; they can also be used as aerial cranes, and their range of activity can reach many kilometers. People can use it to unload cargo from seagoing vessels, or use it to build bridges.

Mil said in the “Literary Gazette” that helicopters have been widely used in the Soviet national economy. In the future, it will mainly be used as a general means of transportation to assist automobiles and general aircraft.

If the three- or four-seat “MI-1” helicopter is an aerial "Victory" car, then the "MI-4" helicopter can be said to be a half-ton truck or a bus carrying twelve passengers. In the future, there will also be helicopters equivalent to two-seat motorcycles and helicopters equivalent to buses carrying sixty to seventy passengers.

Mil also said that now, in addition to the Soviet Union, many other countries are already carrying out the design of this type of aircraft.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, July 21st. Soviet aircraft designer Antonov is designing a single-engine propeller-driven aircraft for use in agriculture. This aircraft can take off and land on any road and rural street, without the need for an airport.

Antonov recently speculated to a "Literary Gazette" reporter about the use of propeller aircraft in the national economy ten years from now. He said that the future of aviation belongs to jet aircraft and atomic-powered aircraft, but does that mean that propeller aircraft will no longer appear in the sky? Of course not. He believes that in the next ten years, propeller aircraft will become as common and necessary in agriculture as tractors or combine harvesters are today. The current tractor drivers, combine harvester operators, and agronomists will become the pilots of aircraft serving agriculture in the future.

Antonov said that ten years from now, at the beginning of spring every year, aircraft will begin to top-dress and sow certain crops, followed by chemical weeding work, which will be thousands of times more efficient than manual weeding. The second top-dressing and pest control work for gardens, vineyards, grains, and sugar beets will also be carried out by aircraft.

    苏联科学家谈未来的原子能飞机
    新型直升飞机能在两小时内改成客机、农业飞机、邮政飞机……
    新华社莫斯科21日电　苏联技术科学博士波克罗夫斯基最近对“文学报”记者说，未来的原子能飞机将装置有一种轻便的原子反应堆，它的能力至少要比苏联第一个原子能电力站的反应堆大十倍。原子能飞机不着陆飞行的距离大约等于环绕地球一周的距离。在最近的将来就会出现原子能飞机了。
    在回答“文学报”记者问1966年的原子能飞机是什么样子的问题时，波克罗夫斯基说，停歇原子能飞机的机场将是很小的，飞机差不多一架紧挨着一架地停在那里。它们的流线型的机身看起来很轻便，机身很长，机舱远远移到前头，而三角翼和两个喷气式发动机伸在后面。乘客走进机舱的时候就会看到，机翼同发动机一道旋转，发动机的轴是垂直的。飞机起飞的时候，发动机的牵引力大于飞机的重量，飞机就像一般的火箭那样升上天空。在飞到一定的高度以后，飞机的机翼和发动机的位置逐渐和地面平行。当飞机要着陆的时候，机身又转变成垂直状态，飞机逐渐减低速度，这样飞机就能够很容易地着陆。
    波克罗夫斯基最后说，在我们的时代，实际情况往往超过幻想。可以想像，1966年实际的原子能飞机会比现在我们所想的更为完善和更为简单。
    新华社莫斯科21日电　苏联飞机设计师米尔最近宣布说，苏联正在制造新型的直升飞机，人们可以根据需要在两小时内把它改变成下列任何一种飞机：客机、农业飞机、邮政飞机和医务飞机。
    将来的直升飞机可以用来运输高山地区的木材；还可以作为空中起重机来使用，它的活动范围可以达到许多公里。人们可以利用它来卸下航海船只的货物，或者利用它来建筑桥梁。
    米尔在“文学报”上说，直升飞机在苏联国民经济中已经得到了广泛的应用。将来它主要将作为辅助汽车和一般飞机的一种通用的运输工具来使用。
  　如果说三四个座位的“МИ—1式”直升飞机是空中的“胜利牌”汽车的话，那么，“МИ—4式”直升飞机就可以说是一辆半载货汽车或是载搭十二个旅客的公共汽车。将来还会有相当于双座位机器脚踏车的直升飞机和载搭六十到七十个旅客的公共汽车的直升飞机。
    米尔又说，现在，除苏联外，还有许多国家都已经在进行这类飞机的设计。
    新华社莫斯科21日电　苏联飞机设计师安东诺夫正在设计一种在农业中使用的单发动螺旋桨推进的飞机。这种飞机可以在任何道路和农村的街道上起飞和降落，不需要飞机场。
    安东诺夫最近对“文学报”记者推测了十年以后螺旋桨飞机在国民经济中的用途。他说，航空的未来是属于喷气式飞机和原子能飞机的，但是，螺旋桨飞机是不是就不再在天空中出现了呢？当然不是那样。他相信，在今后十年中，螺旋桨飞机将像目前农业中的拖拉机或者收获联合机一样成为农业中常见和必要的东西。现在的拖拉机手、收获联合机手和农艺学家将成为未来的为农业服务的飞机的驾驶员。
    安东诺夫说，十年以后，每当初春，飞机就开始对某些作物进行追肥和播种，随后进行化学除草工作，这种除草工作的效率要比用人手除草大几千倍。对花园、葡萄园、谷物和甜菜进行第二次追肥和消灭害虫的工作，也将用飞机来进行。
