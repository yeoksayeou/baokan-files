Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 12th - "Who Runs the Agricultural Cooperative?" This is the question raised by the Shandong Dazhong Daily in its editorial on the 11th.

Advanced cooperatives have become the main organizational form of agricultural production, but how should this large-scale collective economy be managed? Who should be relied upon to manage this economy well? Dazhong Daily said that according to reports from various places, situations that violate the principles of democratic management exist to varying degrees in many cooperatives, and are very serious in some. The main manifestations are: some major affairs in the cooperative are not decided through democratic discussion by the members, but the cadres have the final say; some cooperative cadres do not listen to the opinions of the members, especially negative opinions; they do not handle affairs according to the specific situation and conditions of the cooperative, but follow instructions from above. As a result, the enthusiasm of the members is dampened, and many things are done badly.

There are many reasons why the democratic management of cooperatives is not good. Our cooperative cadres lack experience in managing the cooperative economy of dozens, hundreds, or even thousands of households; and the patriarchal style of individual economy has a profound influence on them. More importantly, the rural Party organizations do not provide enough specific help and education to them, and when deploying work, they do not proceed from reality, and the task requirements are too high and too urgent. The coercive and commanding style of the grassroots cadres also has a very bad influence on the cooperative cadres.

So, how to solve the existing problems and strengthen the democratic management of cooperatives? Dazhong Daily editorial said: We should strengthen the education of cooperative cadres in democratic management, and establish the idea of relying on the democratic management of members; hold regular meetings of members or representatives of members to make decisions on major issues of the whole cooperative; strengthen the work of the cooperative's supervisory committee; when the rural Party and government leading organs deploy work downwards, they should take into account the different situations and conditions of each cooperative. In addition to the leading organs paying attention to overcoming subjectivism and bureaucratic style, they should also often educate grassroots cadres to establish a work style of consulting with the masses when things happen, following the mass line in doing things, and respecting the principles of democratic management of cooperatives.

    “农业社里谁当家”
    新华社济南12日电　“农业社里谁当家”，这是十一日山东大众日报在社论中提出来的问题。
    高级合作社已经成为农业生产的主要的组织形式，但是怎样来管理这种规模较大的集体经济。依靠谁来管理好这种经济？大众日报说，根据各地反映，违背民主管理原则的情形，在许多社中不同程度地存在着，部分社还很严重。主要表现是：社内的一些重大事务，不经社员民主讨论决定，干部说了就算；有些社干部不虚心听取社员的意见，特别是反面的意见；没有按照本社的具体情况和条件办事，而是上领下派。结果挫折了社员的积极性，许多事情因此而办坏。
    合作社的民主管理不好，有多方面的原因。我们的社干部，缺乏管理几十户、几百户以至上千户的合作社经济的经验；而个体经济中的家长制作风对他们又有着深厚的影响。更重要的是，农村党组织对他们具体帮助教育不够，在部署工作时不从实际出发，任务要求过高过急。而基层干部的强迫命令作风，也给社干部以极坏的影响。
    那么，怎样解决现存问题，加强合作社的民主管理呢？大众日报社论说：应当加强社干部民主办社的教育，树立依靠社员民主办社的思想；定期召开社员大会或社员代表大会，对全社重大事情作出决定；加强合作社监察委员会的工作；农村党政领导机关在向下布置工作时，要照顾各个社的不同情况和条件。除了领导机关注意克服主观主义、官僚主义作风之外，还应当经常教育基层干部树立有事和群众商量，办事走群众路线、尊重合作社民主管理原则的工作作风。
