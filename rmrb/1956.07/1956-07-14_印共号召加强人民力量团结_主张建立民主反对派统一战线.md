Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, July 13th: The Communist Party of India (CPI) headquarters issued a communique stating that the Central Committee of the CPI has issued an appeal to all socialists, democrats, patriots, and progressives in India, calling on them to form a united front of democratic opposition.

The Central Committee held a meeting in New Delhi from July 1st. The appeal issued after the meeting pointed out that the upcoming general election will be one of the "major political struggles in recent times" for India.

"Therefore, the democratic opposition parties must further strengthen the unity of the people's forces today so that the people can play their due role in the upcoming elections."

The appeal stated: "The Communist Party of India advocates consolidating the unity of democratic forces achieved through numerous struggles in the past five years, making it a strong democratic opposition in the parliament and state legislatures. It also advocates the establishment of alternative governments in some states. If all the left-wing parties, especially the Communist Party of India, the Praja Socialist Party, and the Socialist Party, can unite on the basis of an agreed minimum program and unite all patriotic and progressive forces opposing the Congress Party around them, this struggle will surely be victorious."

The Central Committee of the Communist Party of India has also established a parliamentary committee responsible for negotiating with other parties and maintaining contact with the election commission. A.K. Gopalan serves as the chairman of the parliamentary committee, and A. Ghosh, S.A. Dange, E.M.S. Namboodiripad, Bhupesh Gupta, P.K. Joshi and others are members.

    印共号召加强人民力量团结
    主张建立民主反对派统一战线
    新华社新德里13日电　印度共产党总部发表的公报说，印度共产党中央委员会向印度所有的社会主义者、民主主义者、爱国者和进步人士发出呼吁，要求他们结成民主反对派的统一战线。
    中央委员会从七月一日起在新德里举行了会议。会后发表的呼吁书指出，即将举行的大选将成为印度“最近时期的重大政治斗争之一”。
    “因此，民主反对党派今天要进一步加强人民力量的团结一致，使人民可以在即将到来的选举中起他们应有的作用。”
    呼吁书说：“印度共产党主张巩固在最近五年中通过多次斗争实现的民主力量的团结，使它成为议会和邦立法机构中的坚强的民主反对派，它还主张在某些邦成立替换政府。如果所有的左翼党派，特别是印度共产党、人民社会党和社会党能够在一致同意的最低纲领的基础上团结一致，并且把所有反对国大党的爱国和进步力量团结在它们周围的话，这个斗争就一定会取得胜利。”
    印度共产党中央委员会还设立了一个议会委员会，负责和其他党派谈判，并且和选举委员会保持联系。议会委员会由阿·库·高普兰担任主席，阿·高士、斯·阿·丹吉、埃·麦·斯·南布德里巴德、布·古普塔、普·克·乔希等人为委员。
