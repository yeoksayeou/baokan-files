Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, July 16th: The Tianjin Municipal Committee of the CPC issued instructions to all enterprise Party committees in the city on the 14th, requiring all enterprises to use practical actions to further promote the advanced producer movement to ensure that the quality of various products reaches national standards and achieves even higher levels in the next two years.

The instructions of the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the CPC, based on the problems existing in the current advanced producer movement, focused on three issues: promoting advanced experience, opposing formalism, and caring for the lives of the masses.

The instructions stated that constantly learning, summarizing, and promoting advanced experience, improving technology, and improving production are the main signs of whether the advanced producer movement is being carried out extensively and in depth. Enterprises should not only learn and promote mature advanced experience from foreign countries, other regions, and other factories, but also pay attention to the small experiences of their own units. When promoting these experiences, they must combine them with the actual situation and production needs of their own units, and use education and demonstration methods to make the masses consciously learn and master them, preventing the tendency of mechanically copying and commandism.

The instructions pointed out that in carrying out the advanced producer movement, it is necessary to oppose a situation where a few leaders, instead of basing their decisions on the actual production movement of the masses, formulate all-encompassing and overly demanding "advanced producer standards" based on their own desires. The "advanced producer standards" should be formulated in accordance with the principle of "from the masses, to the masses," that is, first study the achievements of advanced producers, then summarize a few points, and then set standards that most of the masses can achieve with effort. When some advanced producers far exceed this standard, new standards should be formulated based on the new and more advanced level.

The instructions also require all enterprises to specifically implement the principle of material rewards, enthusiastically care for the lives of the masses, reasonably arrange the spare time of employees, and ensure that employees have enough rest, learning, and free time. All units should organize the masses to carefully check the reward system, wage quotas, welfare facilities, and the solution of certain difficulties in the lives of the masses, and make improvement plans.

    中共天津市委指示各企业
    进一步开展先进生产者运动
    新华社天津16日电　中共天津市委员会14日向全市各企业党委发出指示，要求各企业用进一步开展先进生产者运动的实际行动，来保证今明两年各种产品的质量达到国家标准和达到更高的水平。
    中共天津市委员会的指示，根据目前先进生产者运动中存在的问题，着重提出了关于推广先进经验、反对形式主义和关怀群众生活三个问题。
    指示说，不断地学习、总结和推广先进经验，提高技术，改进生产，是先进生产者运动开展广泛深入与否的主要标志。各企业既要学习和推广外国的、外地的、外厂的成熟的先进经验，也必须重视本单位的点滴经验。在推广这些经验的时候，必须结合本单位的实际情况和生产需要，通过教育、示范的方式，使群众自觉地学习和掌握，防止生搬硬套和命令主义的偏向。
    指示指出，在开展先进生产者运动中，必须反对少数领导者不是根据群众生产运动的实际，而是根据自己的愿望去制定包罗万象的和要求过于苛刻的“先进生产者标准”。应当按照“从群众中来到群众中去”的原则制定“先进生产者标准”，即首先要研究先进生产者所获得的成就，然后概括出几条来，再据此订出多数群众只要努力就可以达到的标准。在一些先进生产者远远超过了这个标准的时候，再根据新的更先进的水平来制定新的标准。
    指示还要求各企业具体贯彻执行物质奖励的原则，热情地关怀群众生活，合理地安排职工业余活动时间，保证职工有足够的休息、学习和自由支配的时间。各单位应当组织群众把奖励制度、工资定额、福利设施、解决某些群众生活困难等工作认真地检查一下，作出改进计划。
