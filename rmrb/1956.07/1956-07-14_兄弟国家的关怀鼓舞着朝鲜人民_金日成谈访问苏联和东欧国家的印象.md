He said that full understanding and agreement had been reached during the talks. The outcome of these talks is a new contribution to the development of friendly and economic ties between North Korea and the Soviet Union, and to the cause of defending peace in Asia and the world. It further encourages the Korean people to strive for the unification of their fatherland and the building of socialism.

The Moscow Radio reporter asked him about his impressions of visiting the People's Democratic countries of Europe. He said that our delegation gained a very good impression. He said that the achievements of the people of various fraternal countries in socialist construction and their experience in struggle have helped us to understand many things. During the talks between our government delegation and the leaders of various fraternal countries, our views were completely一致. In all the talks, the fraternal countries showed great concern for the lives of the Korean people. All of this encourages the Korean people and gives them new strength to carry out the struggle for the peaceful unification of their fatherland and the construction of socialism.

In answering a question about the prospects for the peaceful unification of Korea, Kim Il-sung said that the peaceful unification of Korea is the most urgent demand of all Korean people. Our position and views on this issue have been clearly stated in our previous official statements. The issue of unifying Korea should be resolved by the Korean people themselves on a democratic basis, free from foreign interference. In order to consolidate peace in Korea and peacefully resolve the Korean issue, a conference of relevant Far Eastern countries with representatives from North and South Korea must be convened. He emphasized that the Korean people are fully determined to wage a patient and unyielding struggle for the unification of their fatherland, so as to become the masters of their own destiny. In this struggle, the Korean people have the support of peace-loving people all over the world, and our people will certainly achieve their goal.
