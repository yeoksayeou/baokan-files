Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, July 18th: In Shanxi Province, over 1.1 million young commune members in rural areas have participated in the campaign to strive to become outstanding commune members. The suggestion to launch this campaign was proposed by Ren Huanhai and five other young commune members from Wuxiang County.

Currently, young commune members are actively participating in various activities. In Helingmiao and twelve other townships in Tunliu County, over 2,000 young commune members recently formed 83 flood prevention teams to combat floods during three torrential rainstorms, saving over 600 mu of autumn seedlings and wheat about to be harvested from water damage. In Zhangjiazhuang Agricultural Cooperative in Xiangyuan County, over 100 young commune members helped a neighboring agricultural cooperative weed 150 mu of autumn seedlings during summer hoeing. Young commune members are also actively improving the cooperative's labor management and financial systems during summer production. In Tiejiahui and 26 other agricultural cooperatives in Fanshi County, young commune members put forward over 300 rationalization proposals to the agricultural cooperatives, and more than 170 have been adopted.

Recently, many young commune members have been placed on the honor roll of agricultural cooperatives and have been named outstanding commune members. In the Changzhi Special District alone, more than 42,000 young people have been named outstanding commune members, including Ren Huanhai and the other five young commune members who initiated the campaign.

    山西一百多万青年
    争取做优秀社员
    新华社太原18日电　山西省农村已经有一百一十多万个青年社员参加了争取做一个优秀社员的活动。开展这个活动的建议者，是武乡县任焕孩等六名青年社员提出来的。
    现在，青年社员都积极参加了各种各样的活动。屯留县河神庙等十二个乡的二千多个青年社员，最近在三次倾盆大雨中，组成八十三个防洪队与洪水搏斗，使六百多亩秋苗和即将收割的小麦免受水害。襄垣县张家庄农业社的一百多个青年社员在夏锄中帮助邻村的农业社锄秋苗一百五十亩。青年社员们还在夏季生产中积极改进社的劳动管理和财务制度。繁峙县铁家会等二十七个农业社的青年社员，给农业社提出三百多条合理化建议，已被采纳的有一百七十多件。
    最近，不少青年社员上了农业社的光荣榜，被评为优秀社员。仅长治专区被评为优秀社员的青年就有四万二千多个，其中包括提出倡议的任焕孩等六名青年社员。
