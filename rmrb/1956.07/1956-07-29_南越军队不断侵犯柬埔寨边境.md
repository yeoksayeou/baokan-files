Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 28th -- South Vietnamese Ngo Dinh Diem troops have recently repeatedly invaded the Cambodian border. According to the Cambodian News Agency, despite repeated protests from the Royal Cambodian Government to the South Vietnamese authorities, these border intrusion "incidents are still increasing."

According to news from Phnom Penh, the border intrusions mainly occurred at the junction of Kampong Cham Province in southwestern Cambodia and Tay Ninh Province in South Vietnam. On June 10th and 11th, a total of thirteen South Vietnamese military aircraft intruded into the airspace of Kampong Cham Province, Cambodia. On the afternoon of June 14th, thirty shells fired from the South Vietnamese side landed between the villages of Xi'an and Shanmu in Kampong Cham Province, Cambodia, causing great panic among local residents.

On the afternoon of June 19th, approximately forty members of Ngo Dinh Diem's regular troops invaded a village in the Memot area of the same province in Cambodia. These South Vietnamese troops opened fire on the Royal Cambodian troops stationed there, seized sixteen rifles, and took away seven wounded Cambodian soldiers.

    南越军队不断侵犯柬埔寨边境
    据新华社河内28日电　南越吴庭艳军队最近一再侵犯柬埔寨边境。据柬埔寨新闻社报道，尽管柬埔寨王国政府多次向南越当局提出抗议，但是这种侵犯边境的“意外事件仍在增加中”。
    根据金边来的消息，侵犯边境事件主要发生在柬埔寨西南边境的磅湛省和南越西宁省的交接处。在六月十日和十一日，先后有十三架南越军用飞机侵入柬埔寨磅湛省领空。六月十四日下午，从南越方面发出的三十发炮弹曾落在柬埔寨磅湛省的西庵和珊慕村之间，使当地居民大为恐慌。
    六月十九日下午，约有四十名吴庭艳的正规部队侵入了柬埔寨同一省份的棉末地区的一个村庄。这些南越军队开枪射击了驻扎在那里的柬埔寨王国军队，抢去步枪十六支，并把七个柬埔寨的伤兵带走。
