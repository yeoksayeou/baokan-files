Xinhua News Agency, 20th -- Over six million hectares of cotton across the country have universally budded. Many cotton fields have even begun to form bolls.

According to information obtained from the Ministry of Agriculture, the current growth of cotton in most areas is relatively good. In Henan Province, apart from some cotton fields in the Xinyang area being flooded, the cotton plants in other areas of the 13 million mu of cotton fields have many branches and dense buds. In Jiangxi Province, over 80% of the cotton has also budded and blossomed, with some areas starting to close rows. The best cotton plants have over twenty flower buds each. According to the current cotton growth situation in Shaanxi Province, it is estimated that the total output of the province can be increased compared to last year. In other areas such as the dryland cotton areas in the Yellow River basin including Hebei, Shanxi, and Shandong, as well as the cotton fields along the Yangtze River in Anhui, Zhejiang, Hunan, and Hubei, the growth is generally better than last year.

This year, in the Yangtze River and Huai River basins and some cotton areas in the Yellow River, continuous overcast and rainy weather and low temperatures have affected the development and growth of cotton to a certain extent, and have also led to the spread of pests such as cotton aphids and red spiders, and there are also relatively many weeds in the cotton fields. However, because the state has supplied farmers with relatively large quantities of pesticides and chemical fertilizers this year, and has promptly organized cotton farmers to vigorously carry out the prevention and control of diseases and insect pests and weeding, the cotton growth has been spared from the threat of pests and excessive rain.

At present, cotton farmers in various regions are continuing to strengthen the late-stage management of cotton fields. They are actively carrying out tasks such as pruning, topping, flood prevention, drainage, and topdressing. In areas where bud and boll stage pests have appeared, pesticide spraying and other control work has also begun.

### 全国六百多万公顷棉花现蕾

    全国六百多万公顷棉花现蕾
    新华社20日讯　全国六百多万公顷棉花已经普遍现蕾。其中有许多棉田并且已经开始结桃。
    据从农业部获悉，当前各地棉花生长情况大部都较好。河南省一千三百万亩棉田除信阳专区部分棉田受淹外，其他地区的棉棵都枝多蕾密。江西省有80％以上的棉花也都已现蕾开花、部分已开始封行。最好的棉花每株花蕾达二十多个。陕西省根据目前棉花的生长情况，预计全省总产量可比去年增产。其他如河北、山西、山东等黄河流域的旱地棉区以及安徽、浙江、湖南、湖北等沿江地区的棉田，一般也生长得比去年为好。
    今年长江和淮河流域以及黄河的部分棉区，由于阴雨连绵，气温较低，使棉花的发育生长受到了一定影响，并且也由此引起了棉蚜、红蜘蛛等虫害的蔓延，棉田的杂草也比较多，但由于今年国家在供应农民农药和化学肥料的数量比较多，并且及时地组织了棉区农民大力开展了对病虫害的防治工作和中耕除草工作，因此使棉花生长免除了虫害和多雨的威胁。
    现在，各地棉农还在继续加强棉田的后期管理。积极进行整枝打杈，防涝排水和追肥等工作。在出现蕾、铃期虫害的地区，也已经开始了药剂喷射等防治工作。
