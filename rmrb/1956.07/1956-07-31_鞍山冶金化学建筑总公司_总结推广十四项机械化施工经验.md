Anshan Metallurgical Chemical Construction General Company

Summarizes and Promotes Fourteen Mechanized Construction Experiences

(Our report) The Anshan Metallurgical Chemical Construction General Company summarized fourteen advanced experiences in mechanized construction in the first half of this year. These include the excavator operation and maintenance experience of excellent excavator operator Lang Yunzhi, the advanced pile driver method of scaffolder Zhao Jingchen, the operation and fuel-saving experience of the excellent truck driver Zhang Shimin group, and the single-vehicle accounting system, which is of direct significance for improving mechanical utilization.

These advanced experiences play an important role in improving the utilization rate of existing machinery in Anshan, strengthening machinery maintenance, and reducing mechanical accidents. For example, after excellent excavator operator Lang Yunzhi adopted his operation and maintenance method, he completed 100,000 cubic meters of earthwork in six months and extended the mechanical overhaul interval to 2,600 hours. Scaffolder Zhao Jingchen's pile driver method increased pile driving efficiency tenfold. The single-vehicle accounting system is a complete cost accounting system for construction machinery, which can closely combine the personal interests of workers with the interests of the state.

Currently, the Anshan Metallurgical Chemical Construction General Company has included the promotion of these fourteen advanced experiences in its work plan, formulated promotion targets and specific progress, and these experiences will be widely promoted in the second half of the year.

    鞍山冶金化学建筑总公司
    总结推广十四项机械化施工经验
    本报讯　鞍山冶金化学建筑总公司在今年上半年总结了十四项机械化施工方面的先进经验。其中有优秀挖土机手郎运治的挖土机操作保养经验、架工赵敬臣的先进打桩机工作法、优秀汽车驾驶员张世民小组的操作节油经验，以及对提高机械利用率有直接意义的单车检算制等。
    这些先进经验对提高鞍山现有机械利用率、加强机械维护、减少机械事故有重要作用。如优秀挖土机手郎运治采取他的操作保养法以后，六个月就完成了十万立方公尺土方，还把机械中修间隔期延长到二千六百小时。架工赵敬臣的打桩机工作法提高打桩效率十倍。单车检算制是一种完整的建筑机械的成本检算制度，它可以把工人的个人利益和国家利益密切地结合起来。
    目前，鞍山冶金化学建筑总公司已经把推广这十四项先进经验列入工作部署、制定了推广指标和具体进度，这些经验在下半年将得到普遍推广。　（冯世明）
