Observer's Commentary

    The Korean armistice has been in effect for a full three years. The withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea, a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, and the full implementation of the armistice agreement are matters of universal concern. However, recent developments in Korea indicate that, due to the United States' continued pursuit of cold war and power politics, attempting to maintain tension in Korea, the armistice agreement not only cannot be fully implemented to this day, but also faces the risk of continued violation. This is inconsistent with the general trend of relaxation in the current international situation.

    In Korea, the United States has not only rejected the repeated proposals of the Chinese and Korean governments for convening a conference of relevant countries to discuss the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea and the peaceful reunification of Korea, but has also unilaterally declared that it will no longer abide by the provisions of the Korean Armistice Agreement regarding the exercise of functions by the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission in South Korea, blatantly undermining the effective implementation of the armistice agreement. After the withdrawal of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission's inspection teams, the United States further threatened to abolish the armistice provisions restricting the introduction of reinforcing weapons into Korea. A spokesman for the U.S. Department of Defense recently revealed that the United States had long been creating "grounds" for formally abolishing the Korean Armistice Agreement. The United States International News Service also said that the United States is consulting with the other fifteen countries that participated in the war of aggression against Korea on the abolition of the Korean Armistice Agreement. Under the instigation of the United States' actions to undermine the armistice agreement, the Syngman Rhee clique in South Korea is desperately engaged in war clamoring, openly saying that the prospect of Korean reunification is "really bleak," threatening to arm the aggressive forces in South Korea with new and modern weapons prohibited by the armistice agreement.

    How exactly does the United States create "grounds" to achieve its goal of further undermining the armistice agreement? Recently, U.S. news agencies have been constantly fabricating stories, falsely claiming that the armed forces in northern Korea have greatly expanded, creating an imbalance of power between the two sides, using this as an excuse to cover up its own conspiracy to undermine the armistice agreement and expand its armed forces. The United States' propaganda tactics to undermine the armistice agreement are very clumsy and cannot be believed by anyone. The irrefutable fact is that the Korean-Chinese side has always sincerely implemented all the provisions of the armistice agreement, not only respecting the authority of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission and strictly implementing the provisions restricting the entry of reinforcing weapons, but also, after the Korean armistice, the Chinese People's Volunteers have withdrawn thirteen divisions from Korea, and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea has announced a decision to reduce its army by 80,000 men.

    It is none other than the United States itself that has consistently failed to abide by the Korean Armistice Agreement and has arbitrarily expanded its armed forces. The known fact is that the South Korean army had only sixteen divisions at the time of the armistice, but now it has increased to thirty divisions. The United States will provide South Korea with $420 million in military "aid" this year alone, and will hand over a large number of aircraft and ships. Not only that, but the U.S. Department of Defense recently announced that it would move the so-called United Nations Command from Tokyo to South Korea. According to Agence France-Presse, the purpose of the United States in doing so is to "boost the morale of South Korea." It is not difficult to see that the United States' plot to continue to undermine the Korean Armistice Agreement is an attempt to further unscrupulously arm the South Korean army on a large scale and expand its own military forces in South Korea. Obviously, this action by the United States is completely contrary to the spirit of the Korean Armistice Agreement. This shows that the United States has no intention of withdrawing its troops from Korea or peacefully resolving the Korean issue, but is attempting to permanently occupy South Korea and continue to maintain tension in Korea.

    The United States' attempt to maintain and create tension in Korea is by no means accidental. The current international situation continues to tend towards relaxation, and the call for peaceful coexistence among nations is growing louder. The United States' cold war and power politics are becoming even more unpopular. Especially in Western Europe, a neutral trend has emerged, and it is even more difficult for the United States' "cold war" band to play a tense tune there. Therefore, they are trying their best to threaten and create tension in the Asian and Pacific regions. In Vietnam, the United States openly supports the Ngo Dinh Diem clique in violating the provisions of the Geneva Accords regarding free elections throughout Vietnam, obstructing the peaceful settlement of the Vietnam issue. Disregarding the condemnation of fair world opinion, the United States openly stated that it would maintain its strength and exercise its so-called right of self-defense in Taiwan, a territory of China, and refused to engage in serious negotiations on the peaceful resolution of the tension in the Taiwan region. Recently, the United States has stepped up its military activities in the Pacific region, changing its military organization, while sending U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Radford to the Far East. All of this demonstrates the United States' intention to maintain and create tension in the Asian and Pacific regions. The United States' various activities to aggravate the situation in Korea are part of this conspiracy. People who are concerned about the Korean armistice and hope for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue should be vigilant about all U.S. activities in Korea.

    The Chinese people, together with the Korean people, will continue to work to safeguard the Korean Armistice Agreement and advocate the convening of a conference of relevant countries to peacefully resolve the Korean issue, and will never allow the United States to undermine the Korean Armistice Agreement. It can be said with certainty that the United States' continued maintenance and creation of tension in Korea and Asia will only be condemned by peace-loving countries and people in Asia and the world, making it even more isolated, and it will not gain any advantage.

### 朝鲜停战三周年

    朝鲜停战三周年
    朝鲜停战已经整整三年了。从朝鲜撤退一切外国军队，和平解决朝鲜问题，全部实现停战协定，是大家所关心的问题。但是，最近朝鲜局势的发展表明，由于美国继续奉行冷战和实力政策，力图保持朝鲜的紧张局势，停战协定不但至今不能全部实现，并且有继续遭受破坏的危险，这是同目前国际局势普遍和缓的趋势很不调和的。
    在朝鲜，美国不仅拒绝中朝两国政府关于召开有关国家会议，协商从朝鲜撤退一切外国军队和和平统一朝鲜的历次建议，而且还片面地宣布不再遵守朝鲜停战协定中关于中立国监察委员会在南朝鲜行使职权的条款，公然破坏停战协定的有效实施。在中立国监察委员会各视察小组撤退之后，美国更进一步扬言要废除关于限制增援性武器进入朝鲜的停战条款。美国国防部的发言人最近就曾透露：美国早就在为正式废除朝鲜停战协定制造“根据”。美国国际新闻社也说，美国正在同其他十五个参加侵略朝鲜战争的国家磋商废除朝鲜停战协定。在美国这种破坏停战协定的行为的鼓动下，南朝鲜的李承晚集团更拚命地进行战争叫嚣，公然说朝鲜统一的前景“实在是黑暗的”，威胁着要用停战协定所禁止的新的和现代化的武器来武装在南朝鲜的侵略部队。
    美国究竟怎样制造“根据”来达到它进一步破坏停战协定的目的呢？最近美国通讯社不断无中生有地硬说朝鲜北部的武装力量有了很大扩充，造成了双方力量不均衡的形势，以此作为借口来掩饰它自己破坏停战协定、扩充武装力量的阴谋活动。美国这种破坏停战协定的宣传伎俩是十分拙劣的，是没有任何人能够相信的。无可辩驳的事实是，朝中方面一向真诚地执行了停战协定的所有条款，不仅尊重中立国监察委员会的职权，严格执行了限制运进增援性武器的条款，而且在朝鲜停战以后，中国人民志愿军已经从朝鲜撤出了十三个师，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国宣布了裁减军队八万人的决定。
    一向不遵守朝鲜停战协定、任意扩充武装力量的，不是别人，而恰恰是美国自己。大家知道的事实是，南朝鲜的陆军在停战时只有十六个师，现在已经增加到了三十个师。美国仅在今年就要给南朝鲜四亿二千万美元的军事“援助”，并交给它大量飞机和舰艇。不但如此，美国国防部最近宣布，要把所谓联合国军司令部从东京搬到南朝鲜。据法新社说，美国这样做的目的，是为了“对南朝鲜士气的鼓舞”。不难看出，美国威胁着要继续破坏朝鲜停战协定的阴谋，是企图进一步肆无忌惮地大规模武装南朝鲜军队和扩充它自己在南朝鲜的军事力量。很明显，美国这种举动，是同朝鲜停战协定的精神完全相背驰的。这说明美国根本不打算从朝鲜撤退自己的军队，使朝鲜问题和平解决，而是企图永远霸占南朝鲜，继续保持朝鲜的紧张局势。
    美国力图在朝鲜保持和制造紧张局势，这绝不是偶然的。目前国际局势继续趋向和缓，要求各国和平共处的呼声越来越高，美国的冷战和实力政策更加不得人心。特别是在西欧，中立趋势有了新的发展，美国的“冷战”乐队要在那里奏出紧张的曲子来是更加困难的了。因此，它们就竭力想在亚洲和太平洋地区进行威胁，制造紧张局势。在越南，美国公然支持吴庭艳集团破坏日内瓦协议关于在越南全国进行自由选举的规定，阻挠越南问题和平解决。美国不顾世界公正舆论的谴责，公开表示要在中国的领土台湾保持实力和行使所谓自卫权利，并且拒绝对和平解决台湾地区紧张局势问题作认真的谈判。最近，美国更在太平洋地区加紧军事活动，改变军事机构，同时派遣美国参谋长联席会议主席雷德福到远东来活动。所有这一切，都说明了美国力图在亚洲和太平洋地区保持和制造紧张局势的意图。美国加剧朝鲜局势的各种活动，正是它的这种阴谋的一部分。关心朝鲜停战和希望朝鲜问题和平解决的人们，对美国在朝鲜的一切活动，都应该保持警惕。
    中国人民同朝鲜人民一起，将继续为维护朝鲜停战协定和主张召开有关国家会议和平解决朝鲜问题而努力，决不允许美国破坏朝鲜停战协定。可以肯定地说，美国在朝鲜和亚洲继续保持和制造紧张局势，除了遭到亚洲和世界爱好和平的国家和人民的谴责，而使它自己更加陷于孤立以外，是什么便宜都占不到的。
