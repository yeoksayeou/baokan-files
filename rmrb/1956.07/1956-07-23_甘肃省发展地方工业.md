Gansu Province is newly building and renovating more than twenty local state-owned factories and mines, including power stations, farm implement factories, building materials factories, oil pressing factories, dairy factories, flax processing factories, iron factories, and coal mines.

The six oil pressing factories being built in the oil crop producing areas of Guyuan, Jingyuan, Jiuquan, Linxia, Haiyuan, and Minxian can press more than eighty tons of oilseeds per day. The Rujigou Coal Mine has good quality coal and abundant reserves. After the completion of the power station with a generating capacity of 240 kilowatts, coal production will be greatly increased. In addition to supplying electricity to some local industries and urban lighting, the Jingyuan Power Station will also supply electricity to farmers for irrigating farmland. In previous years, farmers in the Yinchuan area often burned flax stalks as firewood, wasting countless industrial raw materials. After the Yinchuan Flax Processing Factory is completed, it can process a large amount of flax and transport it to Northeast China and other places to be made into burlap bags, bleached linen, or packaging paper. The Lanzhou East District Brick and Tile Factory and the Shakaiyi Brick and Tile Factory are expanding five annular kilns this year. After they are completed and put into production in the third and fourth quarters, they can produce a large number of bricks and tiles to meet the needs of Lanzhou's industrial infrastructure construction.

    甘肃省发展地方工业
    本报讯　甘肃省二十多个地方国营厂矿正在新建和改建，其中包括电站、农具厂、建筑材料厂、榨油厂、乳品厂、亚麻加工厂、铁工厂和煤矿等。
    在油料作物产地固原、靖远、酒泉、临夏、海原、岷县等地修建的六个榨油厂，每天可榨八十多吨油籽。汝箕沟煤矿煤质好，藏量丰富，具有二百四十瓩发电能力的电站建成后，煤产量将大大提高。靖远电站除供当地部分工业和城市照明用电外，还要供农民灌溉农田用电。往年，银川地区的农民常将胡麻秆当柴烧，浪费了无数的工业原料。银川亚麻加工厂建成后，就可大量加工胡麻，运往东北等地制成麻布袋、漂白夏布或包装纸。兰州东区砖瓦厂和沙开驿砖瓦厂，今年扩建的五座轮窑，三、四季度建成投入生产后，能生产大量砖瓦，供兰州工业基本建设需要。
