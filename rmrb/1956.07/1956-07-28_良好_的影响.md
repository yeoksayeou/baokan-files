    "Good" Influence

    The United States has decided to abolish the U.S. Far East Command in Tokyo next year.

    An editorial published in the "New York World-Telegram and Sun" on July 21st believes that the "good influence that this decision may produce" is:

    1. "Encourage Japan's own rearmament";

    2. "Cool down the rising anger of the Japanese people demanding the early return of the Okinawa Islands";

    3. "Counter the Communist propaganda about Japan being completely under our control..." (Note: The United States refers to everything it doesn't want people to know as "Communist propaganda.")

    There is no need to say anything about the first "good influence," let's talk about the latter two:

    Does the removal of this Far East Command mean that even the U.S. occupation forces in Japan will be withdrawn?

    A clear answer can be obtained from a "International News Service" dispatch: "(The U.S.) a senior government official said that the movement of the command does not mean the immediate withdrawal of U.S. troops stationed in Japan." This person also added: The United States does not intend to "greatly change its military strength" in Japan.

    What a "good" influence! According to these Americans, as long as the Far East Command leaves Japan, even though the U.S. occupation forces are still shamelessly stationed in Japan as overlords, people will believe that Japan is not under American control; although the U.S. military is still occupying Okinawa Island, people will believe that there are no American soldiers on this island, so they can "cool down their anger." These Americans are really "talented." Unfortunately, the Japanese people will not have their "rich" imagination.

### “良好”的影响

    “良好”的影响
    美国决定明年撤销东京的美国远东司令部。
    “纽约世界电讯与太阳报”七月二十一日登的一篇社论认为，这个决定“可能产生的良好影响”是：
    一、“鼓励日本自己的重新武装”；
    二、“使日本人要求早日归还冲绳群岛的日益高涨的愤怒情绪消消火气”；
    三、“对共产党关于日本完全在我们控制之下的宣传进行反击……”（按：美国把一切不愿意让人家知道的事情统称之曰“共产党宣传”）
    对第一个“良好影响”就不必说什么了，且谈后面两个吧：
    这个远东司令部撤走，是不是连美国对日本的占领军也撤走了呢？
    从“国际新闻社”的消息里就得到明确的答案：“（美国）一个政府高级人士说，司令部的移动并不意味着要立即撤退驻日本的美国部队”。这个人士还补充了一句：美国并不打算在日本“大大地改变军队实力”。
    多么“良好”的影响呀！照这些美国人看来，只要远东司令部离开了日本，虽然美国占领军仍然老着脸皮驻在日本当太上皇，人们却会相信日本不在美国控制之下了；虽然美军仍然霸占着冲绳岛，人们却会相信这个岛上已经没有美国兵了，因而可以“消消火气”。这些美国人真是“高才”。可惜，日本人民不会有他们这种“丰富的”想像力。
