    To a Girl
    Li Xue'ao
You are such a lovely girl, with your dark hair and rosy cheeks.
Like a bee busy among the flowers,
Ah, you tirelessly walk beside the generator.
You envied the joyful tractor drivers,
And yearned for the distant frontier,
Now your maiden heart,
Seems to have become attached to the generator.

The sun in the sky is bright,
But it only shines during the day, not at night.
The moon in the sky is beautiful,
But it always hides and flickers without light.
Girl, as long as you gently press
With your clever fingers,
The night in Beijing,
Will suddenly become bright!

    给一个姑娘
    李学鳌你是个多可爱的姑娘，黑黝黝的头发红脸庞。像蜜蜂奔忙在花丛里，你啊，不倦地走动在发电机旁。你羡慕过快乐的拖拉机手，也向往过遥远的边疆，如今你那颗少女的心啊，仿佛已沾到发电机上。天上的太阳虽然明亮，它只照白天不照晚上，天上的月亮纵然美好，它总是躲躲闪闪的无光。姑娘啊，只要你把灵巧的手指轻轻一按，北京的夜晚啊，就刷地一下明亮！
