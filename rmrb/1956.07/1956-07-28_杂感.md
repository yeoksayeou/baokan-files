    Random Thoughts

    Dulles is trying to make people believe his newly discovered formula: Neutralism is indifference to others, and indifference to others is immoral.
    The key to this formula lies in—what is “indifference”?
    Or, we can study it from the opposite perspective: what is "caring"?
    Let the facts be the annotation, the fact being American foreign policy.
    A Thai Interior Ministry source said (Agence France-Presse, Bangkok, July 4th) that complaints have been heard from all over Thailand about American experts who are engaged in mapping Thailand and ask "about everything" in Thailand.
    "Asking about everything" naturally means being extremely "caring". Paying close attention to and mapping other countries' territories and geography... This is the "morality" in Dulles's mind.
      The opposite of "morality" is "immorality". Since spying on other countries' territories and interfering in their internal affairs is called "morality", then naturally all countries that do not spy on other countries' territories and interfere in their internal affairs and adopt a policy of neutralism are "immoral".
    The above is a brief interpretation of Mr. Dulles's "Tao Te Ching," please correct it if necessary by the original author!

    A Paris newspaper that advocated continuing the "Cold War" policy, which was launched not long ago, was forced to cease publication after only two months due to a sharp drop in sales (Xinhua News Agency, July 4th).
    Rather than saying that this piece of news explains the newspaper's sales, it is better to say that it explains the sales of the "Cold War" policy.
    People who are good at doing business don't understand how to do business, and capitalists don't understand the market. Who can be blamed for this?

    杜勒斯企图叫人们相信他新发现的公式：中立主义就是对别人漠不关心，对别人漠不关心就是不道德。
    这公式里的关键在于——什么叫“漠不关心”？
    或者，从反面来研究也行，什么叫“关心”？
    让事实来作注解吧，事实是美国的外交政策。
    泰国内政部人士说（法新社曼谷七月四日消息），泰国各地传来对美国专家不满的意见，这些美国专家从事测绘泰国地图的工作，并且对泰国的事“无所不问”云。
    “无所不问”自然是“关心”之至的意思。对别国的领土、地理，十分注意，测之绘之……这就是杜勒斯心目中的“道德”。
      “道德”的反面是“不道德”。既然窥探他国领土，干涉他国内部事情，叫做“道德”，自然凡是一切不去窥探他国领土和干涉他国内政而采取中立主义政策的国家，便是“不道德”的了。
    以上杜勒斯氏“道德经”发微一则，请原著者指正！

    巴黎一家鼓吹继续奉行“冷战”政策的报纸，不久以前创刊，只发行了两个多月，因销路大跌而被迫停刊（新华社七月四日电）。
    与其说这段新闻说明了报纸的销路，毋宁说它说明了“冷战”政策的销路。
    善于做生意的人不懂得做生意，资本家不了解市场，这又能怪谁？
