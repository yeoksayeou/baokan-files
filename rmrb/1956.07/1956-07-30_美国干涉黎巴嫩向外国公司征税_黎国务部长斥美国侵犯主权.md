Xinhua News Agency, Beirut, July 29th: Lebanese Minister of State Saeb Salam denounced the United States on July 28th for "infringing on Lebanon's sovereignty."

Salam's words were directed at a note of protest from the US government, delivered by US Embassy Chargé d'Affaires Emerson to Lebanese President Chamoun. In this protest, the US government expressed its opposition to Lebanon's new law imposing income tax on all foreign companies within its borders.

The Lebanese parliament passed this law at the end of June, stipulating that all foreign companies should be subject to the same income tax as Lebanese companies. Previously, foreign companies enjoyed tax-exempt privileges.

The Lebanese Ministry of Finance requested on July 28th that the foreign-owned Arabian Oil Company and the Iraq Petroleum Company publish their profits within two weeks for tax assessment. After this deadline, their profits will be evaluated by the Lebanese authorities for tax purposes, with an additional 50% penalty.

    美国干涉黎巴嫩向外国公司征税
    黎国务部长斥美国侵犯主权
    据新华社29日讯　贝鲁特消息：黎巴嫩国务部长赛布·萨拉姆七月二十八日斥责美国“侵犯黎巴嫩的主权”。
    萨拉姆的话是针对美国大使馆代办埃默逊向黎巴嫩总统夏蒙递交的一份美国政府的抗议书说的。美国政府在这个抗议书中表示反对黎巴嫩向境内所有的外国公司征收所得税的新法律。
    黎巴嫩国会在今年六月底由国会通过这项法律规定，对所有外国公司征收和黎巴嫩公司同样的所得税。在这以前，外国公司原来享有免税优待。
    黎巴嫩财政部七月二十八日要求外国资本的阿拉伯油管公司和伊拉克石油公司在两星期内公布它们的利润以便征税。过了这个限期，它们的利润就将由黎巴嫩当局来进行估价据以征税，并且增加50％的罚金。
