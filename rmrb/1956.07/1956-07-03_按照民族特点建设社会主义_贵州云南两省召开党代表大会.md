Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang, 1st – The First Congress of the Communist Party of China, Guizhou Province, was held in Guiyang City from June 21st to 30th. The 400 delegates of the Han, Miao, Buyi, Dong, Shui, and Yi nationalities who attended the meeting represented the more than 139,000 Communist Party members in Guizhou Province.

At the meeting, Zhou Lin delivered a work report on behalf of the previous Committee of the CPC Guizhou Provincial Committee. His report focused on analyzing the situation and problems of agricultural collectivization and agricultural production development in Guizhou Province in recent years, and clearly pointed out the guiding principles and tasks for future agricultural production development. The report stated that, as of now, 91.7% of peasant households in Guizhou Province have joined cooperatives, of which 50.3% are participating in agricultural production cooperatives of a completely socialist nature. The report also pointed out that in terms of the speed of agricultural collectivization, there were two right-leaning deviations in 1953 and 1954, which to a certain extent hindered the healthy development of the agricultural collectivization movement. Since the new upsurge in the agricultural collectivization movement in the second half of 1955, crude phenomena have appeared in the work in some areas. In particular, in the past year, some problems have occurred in the implementation of the "prudent and steady" policy and ethnic policies in ethnic minority areas, neglecting ethnic conditions and characteristics, which has brought many harms to the work.

The report pointed out that the basic characteristics of the current rural situation in Guizhou Province are: Due to the great victory of the socialist transformation of agriculture, agricultural production has greatly increased; Greatly increasing production and income has become the urgent demand of the vast number of peasants. Therefore, it is necessary to implement the spirit of the Party Central Committee's instruction on mobilizing all positive factors to build socialism, lead the farmers of all ethnic groups to implement the policy of diversified management with agriculture as the center and the combination of agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry, complete and over fulfill this year's agricultural production increase plan, strive to increase the income of 90% of the cooperative members, and consolidate the existing agricultural production cooperatives through production; Achieve advanced collectivization throughout the province this winter and next spring; Strive to make significant progress in agricultural production in 1957; On the basis of developing production, actively and step-by-step carry out cultural, educational, health undertakings, and the construction of local roads, especially carry out literacy campaigns, disease prevention and treatment, and maternal and child health care work.

All the representatives, after in-depth discussions, agreed and approved this report.

    按照民族特点建设社会主义

    据新华社贵阳1日电　中国共产党贵州省第一届代表大会从六月二十一日到三十日在贵阳市举行。出席这次会议的四百名汉、苗、布依、侗、水家、彝等民族的党员代表，代表着贵州省十三万九千多名共产党员。
    会上，周林代表中共贵州省前届委员会作了工作报告。他的报告着重分析了贵州省几年来农业合作化和农业生产发展的情况和问题，明确指出了今后发展农业生产的方针和任务。报告说，贵州省到目前为止，全省入社农户已占农户总数91.7％，其中参加完全社会主义性质农业生产合作社的有50.3％。报告也同时指出，在农业合作化发展速度问题上，曾于1953年和1954年发生两次右的摇摆，在一定程度上束缚了农业合作化运动的健康发展。1955年下半年以来，全省农业合作化运动出现新的高潮后，部分地区的工作出现了粗糙的现象。特别是最近一年来在少数民族地区执行“慎重稳进”方针与民族政策上发生若干毛病，忽视民族情况和特点，给工作带来了不少危害等等。
    报告指出，当前贵州省农村形势的基本特点是：由于农业社会主义改造的巨大胜利，引起了农业生产的高涨；大大增加生产，增加收入，已经成为广大农民的迫切要求。因此，必须根据党中央关于调动一切积极因素建成社会主义的指示精神，领导各族农民贯彻执行以农业为中心、农林牧业互相结合的多种经营的方针，完成和超额完成今年农业增产计划，争取使90％的社员增加收入，并且通过生产把现有的农业生产合作社巩固起来；在今冬明春实现全省高级合作化；努力使农业生产在1957年内有显著的发展；在发展生产的基础上，积极地有步骤地开展文化、教育、卫生事业和地方道路的建设，特别是开展扫盲、防治疾病和妇幼保健工作。
    全体代表经过深入的讨论，同意并批准了这个报告。
    会议最后选出新的中共贵州省委员会；同时选出了中共贵州省地方组织出席中共第八次全国代表大会的代表十七名。
    本报昆明1日电　中共云南省第一次代表大会，历时六日已于六月三十日结束。出席这次代表大会的有774位正式代表，代表着十七个民族的182万多个党员。省委第二书记于一川同志代表省委向代表大会作了工作报告。会上有一百多位代表发言，对省委所作的工作报告一致表示满意，有的代表对省委某些方面的工作也提出了意见。
    这次会议认为：过去六年来由于执行了党中央规定的政治路线，全省得以胜利地完成各项任务，并取得了社会主义革命决定性的胜利。会议还指出：目前的任务是进一步团结全省各族人民，发挥全党和全体人民群众的积极性和创造性；加强对农业生产和全面发展农村经济的领导，积极地支援大工业的建设。同时，还必须加强民族工作，根据党的民族政策，结合各民族的具体情况，积极地有步骤地领导各民族为建成社会主义社会而努力。为了完成这一伟大任务，必须进一步活跃党的生活，必须加强党的统一和团结，必须加强人民民主专政和党的统一战线工作，必须巩固国防。
