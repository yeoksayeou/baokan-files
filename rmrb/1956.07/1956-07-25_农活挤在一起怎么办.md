    What to Do When Farm Work Piles Up
    Professional Teams Work Flexibly

    Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, July 23rd: Agricultural production cooperatives in the Yibin Special District of Sichuan Province have universally established professional teams to carry out the autumn harvest and autumn planting.

    Before the establishment, each agricultural cooperative planned and arranged all the farm work and all the labor force of the entire cooperative. Then, the work was contracted to professional teams, and those who completed the work well and quickly could get extra rewards. Professional teams are under the unified leadership of the production team, and manpower is flexibly adjusted according to seasonal changes.

    Now, more than two thousand cooperatives in Yibin County have generally established professional teams for threshing, rice transplanting, and miscellaneous work. Each group selects farmers with professional production experience to lead, and the cooperative also allocates a certain number of farm tools and cattle for use within the group.

    Since the beginning of July, many professional teams have started their activities. More than one hundred and fifty cooperatives in Daguan District, Nanxi County, have generally implemented the method of simultaneous harvesting, plowing, and planting because they all have professional teams. From July 4th to 15th, the cooperatives rushed to harvest more than 10,000 mu of "Southern Special No. 1" early rice, and also transplanted late rice. The Dongsheng Agricultural Cooperative in Nanping Township, Qingfu County, not only harvested 62 mu of early rice and transplanted more than 40 mu of late rice in five days, but also sowed 35 mu of autumn corn, accumulating a total of 50,000 jin of green fertilizer.

    Small-Scale Operation System Has Many Advantages

    Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, July 23rd: Since the Tuanjie Agricultural Production Cooperative in Anju Township, Quwo County, Shanxi Province, implemented a small-scale operation system for field farm work, the wheat harvest, replanting, weeding, and pest control have been carried out quickly and well. Most of the more than 8,000 mu of cotton has grown fruit branches and lotus leaves, and the more than 5,000 mu of replanted autumn crops are growing vigorously. The wheat has also been successively stored in warehouses recently.

    The Tuanjie Cooperative has more than 800 households, forming a total of 18 production teams. In the past, the production order was very chaotic, and each team lacked sectional arrangements for farm work. Especially since the beginning of summer, there has been a lot of farm work, and each production team has found it even more difficult to arrange farm work and allocate manpower. Under this circumstance, the Management Committee decided to try out a small-scale operation system for field farm work. On the basis of the original labor quota, the land, labor, farm tools, and animal power were fixed to the production team. Each production team established three to five long-term production responsibility groups according to its own needs, and divided field responsibility land for the members according to their labor strength and technical level. The project operations and payment standards were specified, and piece-rate wages were implemented. The cooperative and the teams arranged farm work stations and made short-term arrangements. Each group made small-scale operation plans according to the task list.

    Arranging Farm Work in Sequence

    Xinhua News Agency: The Shutang Township First Agricultural Production Cooperative in Zhuji County, Zhejiang Province, rationally arranged farm work to solve the difficulty of insufficient labor during the summer harvest and summer planting. The Hengtang Township First Agricultural Cooperative used to be a single-season late rice area. In the past, around "Great Heat," the farmers' habit was to go out in the morning to weed the fields and catch fish or chop wood in the afternoon. This year, 1,792 mu of the cooperative's 2,566 mu of paddy fields were converted to double-cropping rice. Early rice needs to be harvested in a timely manner, and 640 mu of continuous late rice needs to be transplanted before the Beginning of Autumn; more than 1,100 mu of intercropped late rice needs to be strengthened in management; miscellaneous grains need to be cut grass, turned over, and fertilized at this time; tea mountains also need to be cut grass and the third tea picked. These farm works are crowded together, and the labor force cannot be allocated. After analyzing these situations, the branch of the Communist Party of China of Shutang Township First Agricultural Production Cooperative mobilized the masses to raise problems and think of solutions. First, do the farm work that can be done in advance. The cooperative's 30-person miscellaneous grain production team is now planning to complete all the grass cutting and fertilization before the early rice harvest, so that 26 people can be drawn to invest in the summer harvest and summer planting. Before the early rice harvest, the entire cooperative can also cut 360,000 jin of green grass for compost, and transport the base fertilizer for continuous late rice to the fields; tea picking is done as needed, striving to complete the picking before harvesting the early rice. At the same time, after labor force scheduling, of the cooperative's 330 female laborers, excluding pregnant women and sick women, 109 stronger women can be drawn to participate in major farm work such as rice harvesting and water drawing; the cooperative's 60 single men have been arranged to have women from each production team help them with laundry, cooking, and drying grain. During the summer harvest and summer planting, the weather is hot, so it was decided to adopt the method of going out early and resting at noon to ensure the health of the members.

    农活挤在一起怎么办
    专业小组办事灵活
    新华社成都23日电　四川宜宾专区各农业生产合作社普遍成立专业小组，进行秋收秋种。
    在建立前，各农业社都把全社的农活和全部劳动力作了规划和排队。然后把活计包给专业小组，活计完成的又好又快的可得超额奖励。专业小组由生产队统一领导，根据季节变化，灵活调剂人力。
    现在，宜宾县二千多个社一般都分别成立打谷、栽秧和杂活等专业小组。每组选出有专业生产经验的农民领导，社里还分别配备一定数量的农具、耕牛，由组内使用。
    七月初起，许多专业小组已开始活动。南溪县大观区一百五十多个社因为都有了专业小组，普遍实行边收、边犁耙、边种的办法。从七月四日到十五日，各社把一万多亩“南特号”早稻抢收完毕，同时也都插栽了晚稻。庆符县南屏乡东升农业社在五天时间内，不仅收完六十二亩早稻，栽完四十多亩晚稻，还播种三十五亩秋玉米，共积五万多斤青肥。
    小段作业制好处多
    新华社太原23日电　山西省曲沃县安居乡团结农业生产合作社实行了田间农活小段作业制后，麦收、复播、锄草、除虫各项农活进行的又快又好。八千多亩棉花大部分长出果枝和荷叶，五千多亩复播秋禾生长茁壮，小麦最近也陆续储入仓库。
    团结社有八百多户农户，共计组成十八个生产队。过去生产秩序很乱，各队缺乏农活的分段安排，特别是入夏以来农活多，农活忙，各生产队更加难以安排农活，调配人力。在这种情况下，管理委员会决定试行田间农活小段作业制。在原来劳动定额的基础上，把土地、劳力、农具、畜力固定到生产队。每个生产队根据自己的需要，建立三至五个长年生产责任组，根据社员劳力强弱和技术高低，给社员划分田间责任地。规定作业项目和计酬标准，实行按件计工。社、队进行农活站队，作出短期安排，各小组按照领工表作出小段作业计划。
    分别先后安排农活
    据新华社讯　浙江省诸暨县树塘乡第一农业生产合作社合理安排农活，解决夏收夏种中劳力不足的困难。横塘乡第一农业社过去是单季晚稻地区，往年在“大暑”前后，农民的习惯是早上出门耘田，午后捕鱼或者砍柴。今年，全社二千五百六十六亩水稻田有一千七百九十二亩改种了双季稻。早稻要及时收割，六百四十亩连作晚稻要在立秋前插秧，一千一百多亩间作晚稻要加强管理；杂粮要在这时削草、翻地和施肥；茶山也需削草和采取三茶。这些农活挤在一起，劳动力调配不开。中共树塘乡第一农业生产合作社支部在分析了这些情况以后，便发动群众摆问题、想办法。首先把可以提前做的农活提前来做。该社一个三十人的杂粮生产队现计划在早稻收割前把削草、施肥全部做完，这样，可以抽出二十六人投入夏收夏种。在早稻收割前全社还可削好三十六万斤青草做堆肥，并把连作晚稻的底肥运到田头去；采摘茶叶做到随有随采，争取在割早稻前采完。同时，经过劳动力排队，全社三百三十多个妇女劳动力，除去孕妇、病妇外，可抽出一百零九个较强的妇女参加割稻、车水等主要农活；全社六十个单身汉，已安排好由各生产队抽调妇女帮助他们洗衣、烧饭和晒谷。夏收夏种时，气候炎热，决定采用提早出门、中午休息的办法，保证社员身体健康。
