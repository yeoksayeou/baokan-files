Is Setting Up Dedicated Cadres Enough to Strengthen Leadership?
	Gan Cheng

	Assigning cadres to specialize in leading sideline production in agricultural producers' cooperatives is one of the effective measures to develop sideline production. However, some management committees of agricultural producers' cooperatives, after assigning dedicated cadres to be responsible for leading sideline production, simply abandon it, neither frequently studying the problems of sideline production nor actively helping the dedicated cadres to solve specific problems and overcome difficulties. As a result, the leadership of sideline production has not been strengthened.

	In the Fengjing, Chengxi, and Tiankun districts of Songjiang County, Jiangsu Province, 51 cooperatives have already established dedicated sideline production cadres. Among these cooperatives, 20 have management committees that have not studied sideline production. The management committee of the Chengxi District's Prosperity Agricultural Producers' Cooperative does not study or assist sideline production, only asking the dedicated cadres to "take responsibility" for this and "guarantee" that, leaving them at a loss, and as a result, they can't take responsibility for anything or guarantee anything.

	Why do these agricultural cooperative management committees ignore sideline production? One argument is: "We are already too busy with agricultural production; where do we have time to manage sideline production?" Another argument is: "Our dedicated sideline production cadres are very responsible; we can just assign them to do it, and they will do a good job."

	Is it really that there's no time to manage sideline production? Let's look at how the Huaxing Agricultural Producers' Cooperative in Chengdong District of Songjiang County leads sideline production. The dedicated sideline production cadres of this cooperative formulate monthly sideline production plans and submit them to the management committee in advance, so that the management committee can comprehensively consider and arrange them uniformly; the management committee also frequently inspects the implementation of the sideline production plan and helps solve specific problems. As a result of doing this, the leadership of agricultural production has not been weakened, and sideline production has also developed rapidly, achieving monthly income.

	Can sideline production be done well simply by having a dedicated cadre responsible for it? The management committee of the Limin Agricultural Producers' Cooperative in Fengjing District, Songjiang County, does not manage sideline production. The dedicated sideline production cadres could not find a way to develop sideline production and blindly ordered a thousand Leghorn chickens; due to a lack of experience in raising this type of chicken, even though they only bought a hundred and fifty, more than fifty died soon after. The management committee accepted this lesson and began to pay attention to collective research on sideline production. In this way, they found more ways to develop sideline production, had guaranteed technology, and had confidence in sales channels. It is estimated that this year's sideline income will reach 40% of the total income.

	Agricultural production is certainly important; however, sideline production is also closely related to ensuring increased income for more than 90% of the members. The management committee of an agricultural cooperative is the overall management organization of the entire cooperative, which must manage both agricultural production and sideline production. It is necessary to have a dedicated person responsible for sideline production; however, it does not mean that the management committee can no longer be responsible once there is a dedicated person responsible. It is hoped that the leadership organs in various regions will carefully examine the leadership situation of sideline production in various cooperatives, and must not simply see that each cooperative has set up dedicated sideline production cadres and think that there are no problems with the leadership of sideline production.

    设了专职干部就算加强领导吗？
    干城
    农业生产合作社抽出干部专门领导副业生产，是开展副业生产的有效措施之一。可是，一些农业生产合作社的管理委员会，在抽出专职干部负责领导副业生产以后，就丢开不管了，既不经常地研究副业生产问题，也不积极地帮助专职干部解决具体问题和克服困难。结果，副业生产的领导并没有加强。
    江苏省松江县的枫泾、城西、天昆三个区，已经有五十一个社设立了副业专职干部。在这些社当中，就有二十个社的管理委员会没有研究过副业生产。城西区繁荣农业生产合作社的管理委员会，对副业生产工作不研究、不帮助，只是要专职干部对这“负责”，对那“保证”，使得他们不知如何是好，结果是什么也负责不了，什么也保证不了。
    这些农业社管委会为什么不管副业生产呢？一种论调是：“农业生产还忙不过来，哪里再有时间管副业？”又一种论调是：“我们的副业专职干部很负责，分工给他们做，就可以做好。”
    真的没有时间管副业吗？看看松江县城东区华星农业生产合作社是怎样领导副业生产的吧，这个社的副业专职干部按月制定副业生产计划，并提前交管委会，使管委会能全面考虑、统一安排；管理委员会又经常检查副业生产计划执行情况，并且帮助解决具体问题。这样作的结果，并没有削弱农业生产的领导，副业也发展的很快，作到了月月有收入。
    光是有一个专职干部负责，就能把副业生产搞好吗？松江县枫泾区利民农业生产合作社的管委会不管副业，副业专职干部找不到副业生产门路，盲目地订购了一千只莱克亨鸡；由于缺乏饲养这种鸡的经验，虽然还只买了一百五十只，不久就死了五十多只。管委会接受了这个教训，对副业开始注意了集体研究。这样，找到的副业生产门路多了，技术上有保证，销路也有把握，预计今年副业收入将达到总收入的40％。
    农业生产当然重要；可是，副业生产对于保证90％以上的社员增加收入也有极密切的关系。农业社的管理委员会是全社总的管理机关，既要管理农业生产，也要管理副业生产。副业生产有专人负责是必要的；可是，决不是说有了专人负责，管理委员会就可以不再负责了。希望各地领导机关仔细检查一下各个合作社副业生产的领导状况，千万不可只看到各个社设了副业专职干部就认为副业生产的领导已经没有什么问题了。
