(Dispatch from our newspaper in Hefei) The Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Plant has begun a large-scale expansion project. Five new blast furnaces are under construction. The Aoshan, Nanshan, and Changlongshan iron mines are about to begin expansion and restoration. In addition, a sintering workshop and two automated riverside terminals for transportation and loading/unloading will be newly built. These projects are planned to be completed and put into production next year. At that time, the plant's pig iron production will increase threefold, and ore production will increase by one to two times.

The iron ore reserves near Ma'anshan are abundant, with an iron content of 50%-60%. The person in charge of the Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Plant told reporters that after the new blast furnaces are put into production, if there are comprehensive utilization equipment, just using the gas from the iron smelting furnaces can generate 39,000 kilowatts of electricity; the by-products produced from steelmaking from the annual iron production can be made into 280,000 tons of phosphate fertilizer.

(Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou) Large-scale reconstruction projects at the Aganzhen and Shimen Gou coal mines in Gansu Province have fully commenced. After the main projects of the two coal mines are completed and put into production by the end of this year, coal production will increase more than five times compared to the present.

The Aganzhen Coal Mine and Shimen Gou Coal Mine were originally manually operated and small in scale. Although some reforms have been carried out since liberation, they are still far from meeting the needs of the increasingly developed industrial coal consumption in the Lanzhou area. Therefore, it was decided to carry out large-scale reconstruction of these two mines.

A total of 224 construction projects will be carried out in the two mines this year, including expanding and repairing shafts, building new substations, coal preparation plants, belt conveyor corridors, high-voltage transmission lines, and administrative welfare complexes. These projects are now under intense construction, and the substation for all mechanization and lighting needs and the 21-kilometer-long high-voltage transmission line have been basically completed.

    甘肃阿干镇和石门沟两煤矿进行改建
    本报合肥电　马鞍山铁厂开始了大规模的扩建工程。五座新的高炉正在兴建。凹山、南山、长龙山铁矿即将开工扩建和恢复。此外，还要新建一个烧结车间和两个运输装卸自动化的江边码头。这些工程都计划在明年完工投入生产。那时，全厂的生铁产量将增加三倍，矿石产量将增加一倍到两倍。
    马鞍山附近的铁矿蕴藏丰富，含铁量达50％—60％。马鞍山铁厂的负责人对记者说，在新的高炉投入生产后，如果能够有综合利用的设备，只是把炼铁炉中的煤气利用起来，就能够发电三万九千瓩；一年中所产的铁，在炼钢以后产生的副产品，可作成二十八万吨磷肥。
    新华社兰州电　甘肃省阿干镇和石门沟两个煤矿的大规模改建工程，已经全面动工。到今年年底，两个煤矿的主要工程竣工投入生产以后，煤的产量将比现在提高五倍以上。
    阿干镇煤矿和石门沟煤矿，原来都是手工生产，规模较小。解放以后虽然进行过一些改革，但是还远远不能满足兰州地区日益发展的工业用煤的需要。因此，这两个矿决定进行大规模的改建。
    两矿今年施工的工程共二百二十四项，包括扩修巷井、新建变电所、选煤厂、皮带运输机走廊、高压输电线路和行政福利联合大楼等。现在这些工程都正在紧张施工，其中能供全部机械化及照明用的变电所和二十一公里长的高压输电线路，已经基本建成。
