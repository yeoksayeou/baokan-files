Kunming dispatch from our newspaper: The wage reform has ignited the enthusiasm of Kunming workers for learning. The Kunming Machine Tool Plant conducted skill-based promotions during the wage reform. Workers said, "Even if we fail the assessment, we can still examine our skills and find directions for improvement." Encouraged by the skill-based promotions, their enthusiasm for learning technology and culture has greatly increased, with attendance rates for learning rising from 75% to over 90%. In the past, many salespersons at the No. 1 Department Store of the Kunming Department Store Company had the idea of "same pay regardless of effort." Some had been salespersons for two or three years but still didn't know how to use an abacus or prepare reports. After the wage reform, everyone valued professional studies. Many salespersons used their rest time to practice mental arithmetic and study product performance. Some copied product performance onto notebooks for easy reference and memorization.

    昆明实行考工晋级
    职工热情学习技术
    本报昆明电　工资改革激发了昆明市职工的学习热情。昆明机床厂在工资改革中进行了考工晋级，工人说：就是考不及格，也检查了自己的技术，找出了努力方向。他们在考工晋级的鼓舞下，学习技术和文化的热情大大提高，学习的出勤率由75％提高到90％以上。昆明市百货公司第一门市部，过去不少营业员都有“多干少干，照样拿钱”的思想，有当了两三年营业员还不会打算盘、做报表的。工资改革以后，大家都重视了业务学习，很多营业员利用休息时间练习珠算，研究商品性能，有的把商品性能抄在笔记本上，以便翻阅、背诵。
