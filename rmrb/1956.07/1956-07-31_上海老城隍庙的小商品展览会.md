Xinhua News Agency report:

    A small commodity exhibition featuring over 3,500 kinds of inexpensive and high-quality handicrafts is currently being held at the Old City God Temple in Shanghai, the largest distribution center for handicrafts. Visitors can purchase imitation jewelry, hairpins in forty-nine colors, gilded or silver copper necklaces, bracelets, and earrings, colored glass inlaid rings resembling rubies or emeralds, various silk and bamboo musical instruments, over eighty kinds of cigarette cases and pipes, and exquisite ivory, crystal seals, and jade ornaments. Items that are difficult to find elsewhere, such as false hair, maple vine bracelets for the elderly, and hairpiece frames for elderly women, are also available at this exhibition.

    It is said that the City God Temple here was built during the Yongle period of the Ming Dynasty. After hundreds of years of development and changes, it gradually formed a distribution market for small commodities. Now, more than 600 small vendors and over 100 handicraft households live around the temple, maintaining close supply and sales relationships with more than 90 cities across the country. After the upsurge of socialist transformation of private industrial and commercial enterprises and the cooperative movement of handicrafts this year, some supply and sales relationships were severed, and some self-produced and self-sold retail departments were closed down, which led to a temporary reduction in the variety of commodities at the Old City God Temple market. Since April of this year, the original supply and sales relationships have gradually been restored. This exhibition is being held to further facilitate supply and sales relationships, promote the original business characteristics, and expand the variety of commodities.

    上海老城隍庙的小商品展览会
    据新华社讯　有三千五百多种价廉物美的手工业小商品，最近在上海最大的手工业品集散市场——老城隍庙展出。人们可以在这里买到赛珍饰品，四十九种花色的发夹，镀金或银的铜质项圈、手镯和耳环，近似红宝石或翡翠戒指的彩色玻璃嵌宝戒指，各种丝竹乐器，八十多种烟盒、烟斗，精致的象牙、水晶图章和玉石饰件。别处很难买到的假头发、老年人用的枫藤镯和老年妇女用的发髻壳等，这个展览会上都有。
    据说这里的城隍庙建于明代永乐年间，经过几百年的发展变迁，逐渐形成一个小商品的集散市场。现在，庙的四周住着六百多家小商贩和一百多户手工业者，他们和全国九十多个城市保持着密切的供销关系。今年私营工商业社会主义改造和手工业合作化高潮以后，一部分供销关系被切断，一些自产自销的门市部被撤销，老城隍庙市场的商品花色品种一度减少。今年四月份以来原有供销关系逐渐恢复。这次展览会就是为了进一步沟通供销关系，发扬原有经营特点和扩大花色品种而举办的。
