    Good News for Field Workers (Picture)
    The Harbin Joint Public-Private Songhua River Furniture Factory recently manufactured forty easily movable prefabricated houses for use by field survey teams. This type of prefabricated house is composed of one hundred and sixty components. Disassembling all the components of the entire house, a single horse-drawn rubber-tired cart can carry them all away. The area of the prefabricated house is thirty-six square meters, which can accommodate ten people for office work or sixteen people for lodging. Xinhua News Agency reporter Hu Wei photographed.

    哈尔滨公私合营松花江家具厂最近制造了四十幢移动方便的活动房子，供给野外工作的勘测队使用。这种活动房子由一百六十块部件组成。把整幢房子的部件拆卸开来，用一辆马拉胶皮大车就能全部装走。活动房子的面积有三十六平方公尺，能供十个人办公或十六个人住宿。　新华社记者　胡伟摄
