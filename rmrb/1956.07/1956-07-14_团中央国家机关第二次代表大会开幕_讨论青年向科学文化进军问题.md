Xinhua News Agency, July 12th. The Second Representative Congress of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League in National Government Agencies opened in Beijing on the 12th. The congress will focus on discussing and resolving several common issues concerning the advancement of youth towards science and culture in central government agencies. During the congress, representatives will hear reports from Guo Moruo, President of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and Hu Yaobang, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League. A group of outstanding young League members and youth who have made significant achievements in their work and persisted in after-work studies will be commended and rewarded at the meeting.

　　Tan Xisan, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League in National Government Agencies, delivered a report at the meeting today. His report pointed out that the task of the League in the future is to strengthen leadership, organize and systematically consolidate the enthusiasm of youth for advancing towards science, and help them stubbornly and persistently advance towards science. He believes that the basic policy and direction for on-the-job youth advancing towards science should be to gradually master their professional skills, and they must combine their studies with their work. It is necessary to overcome the one-sidedness of neglecting and belittling current work, but also not to negate or exclude learning and mastering a second skill under the premise that they are already competent in their own business.

　　The report said that establishing a good style of learning that combines tenacious striving and seeking truth from facts requires the greatest perseverance and sustained effort to complete the long and arduous task of advancing towards science. Currently, some young people lack confidence in on-the-job studies and believe that they cannot achieve anything significant through after-work studies, which is unfounded. The report also believes that the League organization must organize youth to voluntarily formulate a study plan for a certain period of time that has the greatest determination but is also realistic and feasible, and help young people in the agencies establish a variety of after-work learning organizations that suit their needs. The League organization must also help young people solve the problems of learning conditions and time for after-work studies.

　　A total of 1,057 representatives and observers attended the congress.

    团中央国家机关第二次代表大会开幕
    讨论青年向科学文化进军问题
    新华社12日电　青年团中央国家机关第二次代表大会十二日在北京开幕。大会将着重讨论和解决中央国家机关青年向科学、文化进军的几个带有普遍性的问题。大会期间，代表们将听取中国科学院院长郭沫若和青年团中央书记处书记胡耀邦的报告。一批在工作中做出显著成绩和坚持业余进修成绩优秀的青年团员和青年，将在会上受到表扬和奖励。
    青年团中央国家机关委员会书记谭西三今天在会上作了报告。他的报告指出：今后团的任务就是加强领导，有组织有计划地巩固青年向科学进军的热情，帮助青年顽强持久地向科学进军。他认为，在职青年向科学进军的基本方针和方向应该是从逐步精通本行业务作起，必须把自己的进修和工作结合起来，要克服忽视和轻视当前工作的片面性，但是，也不抹煞或排斥在已经能够胜任自己业务的前提下学习和掌握第二种技能。
    报告中说，要建立顽强进取和实事求是相结合的优良学风，需要最大的恒心和坚持的努力才能完成向科学进军这个长期而艰巨的任务。当前一部分青年对在职进修缺乏信心，认为业余进修学不出什么名堂的思想是没有依据的。报告中还认为，团组织必须组织青年自愿的拟订一种一定时间的、具有最大决心而又实事求是、切实可行的进修规划，帮助机关青年建立多种多样的、适合自己需要的业余学习组织。团组织还必须帮助青年解决学习条件和业余进修的时间问题。
    出席这次大会的代表和列席代表共一千零五十七人。
