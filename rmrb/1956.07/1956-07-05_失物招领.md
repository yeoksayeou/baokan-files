    “Lost and Found”
    Wang Pu
    In our production enterprises and construction sites, there are some people who regard national wealth as mere dirt, and their behavior is sometimes shockingly bad. If you don't believe it, please take a look at the following letter:

    Editor: Back in 1953, the exploration team of the former 315 Factory under the Ministry of Heavy Industry, when conducting refractory material exploration in Tanjiashan area, Xiangtan, Hunan, rented two rooms from farmers and placed hundreds of bags, about a hundred tons, of the mined refractory clay inside. At that time, it was agreed that the rent would be one yuan per room per month. Who knew that three years had passed, and this batch of refractory clay was still unattended. The farmers had written several letters to the responsible authorities to inquire, but never received a single word in reply. Not only was the rent not paid, but the stored items were also unwanted! Our factory wants to utilize these clay and is willing to pay the farmers' rent, but we cannot find the owner of the goods. It is said that the exploration team of 315 Factory no longer exists! It is a pity that these materials are left unattended. We hope that the relevant authorities will quickly deal with this matter and cherish the property of the state.
                        Director of the Local State-Owned Hunan Refractory Material Factory
                              Gao Shicheng

    This is really strange. Of course, we don't yet know who this "spendthrift" is who lost the items and doesn't want them, but we hope that after reading the letter above, they can examine themselves and prevent similar incidents from happening again.

    So, how should we deal with the problem raised by Comrade Gao Shicheng? In fact, this problem is very easy to solve: Please have the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry investigate the responsibility and give the Hunan Refractory Material Factory a reply, explaining whether it is permissible to use that portion of the materials.

    But, what if the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry is slow to reply?

    I think, the Hunan Refractory Material Factory can pay the farmers' rent and also use the refractory clay. Because utilizing all usable materials to serve socialist construction is not only not illegal, but should also be commended.

    “失物招领”
    王朴
    在我们的生产企业和建设工地上，有一些人把国家财富视同粪土，他们的行为有时是出奇的坏。谁要不信，请看看下面这封信：
    编辑同志：还在1953年，原重工业部所属315厂勘探队，在湖南湘潭谭家山地区进行耐火材料勘探的时候，曾租了农民两间房子，把采得的耐火粘土数百包约百多吨放在里面。当时言定，每月每间房子租价一元。谁知道，时间过去三年了，这批耐火粘土还无人过问。农民曾写了几次信到主管机关询问，从未得到半语只字答复，房租没有人付不说，存的东西也没有人要了！我们厂是想利用这些粘土的，也愿意付给农民房租，就是找不到货物的主人。据说，315厂勘探队这个机构早就不存在了！这些物资无人过问实在可惜。希望有关机关迅速处理这件事，惜爱国家的财产。
                        地方国营湖南耐火材料厂厂长
                              高石成
    这真是怪事。当然，我们现在还不知道这位丢了东西不要的“败家子”是谁，但是希望他看到上面这封信后能够检查一下，以后不要再发生类似的事。
    那么，高石成同志提出的问题怎么办呢？其实，这个问题倒是非常好解决的：请冶金工业部查明责任，给湖南耐火材料厂一个答复，说明是否可以动用那部分物资。
    但是，如果冶金工业部迟迟不答复又怎么办呢？
    我想，湖南耐火材料厂可以付给农民房租，也可以动用耐火粘土。因为利用一切能利用的物资为社会主义建设服务，不仅不是犯法行为，而且应该受到表扬。
