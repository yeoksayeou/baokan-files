    When Can Deliveries Be Made on Time?
    The steel bar straightening machines produced by our Beijing People's Machine Factory use the traction electromagnets and other electrical control equipment supplied by the Shenyang Small Switch Factory as their main components. The contract we signed with the two factories was: They would supply a total of 140 pieces of eight types of electrical control equipment, including traction electromagnets. Twenty pieces were to be delivered in January, forty pieces in March, sixty pieces in April, and twenty pieces in May. However, the Shenyang Small Switch Factory did not deliver according to the contract at all. The twenty pieces originally scheduled for delivery in January had not arrived by the end of January. In February, we sent someone to supervise the delivery, but they kept postponing it, from today to tomorrow, and from tomorrow to the day after. They postponed it from the end of February to March 5th, and from March 5th to March 15th, but still did not deliver.
    Regarding this matter, our factory made more than a dozen long-distance phone calls to the factory and its leading authority, the Shenyang Electrical Industry Company, sent nine official letters, and assigned a person to urge the delivery in Shenyang for a month and a half. When they saw that we were pressing them hard, they said, "We have failed several times in trial production. Now it has been transferred to the Chunxin Factory for production, and it will not be delivered until the end of April." Our factory's representative in Shenyang requested to see the actual situation on the spot, but they never allowed it. On March 16th, we sent a section chief and a technician to negotiate, and only then did we find out the truth: they had not organized trial production at all. The so-called "several failures in trial production" were all lies. Later, with the support of the factory's Party committee, Section Chief Niu of the technology section organized technicians and veteran workers to do it themselves, and in just ten days, they made twenty units, and the quality was very good.
    The goods for January were finally delivered. As for the forty pieces that should have been delivered in March, they were not delivered until April 16th after our repeated urging. The sixty pieces that should have been delivered in April were only forty-five pieces by May 29th. As for the twenty pieces that should have been delivered in May, we don't know when they will be delivered?
    We feel that the Shenyang Small Switch Factory does not lack technology, but lacks an overall perspective and the spirit of thinking about the situation from the perspective of brother enterprises. We hope that the leading comrades of this factory will earnestly change this irresponsible style.

    什么时候才能按期交货？
    我们北京人民机器厂生产的钢筋调直机，所用的主要部件——牵引电磁铁等电器控制器，是由沈阳小型开关厂供应的。我们两个厂签订的合同是：由他们供应牵引电磁铁等八种电器控制设备共一百四十件。一月份交二十件，三月份交四十件，四月份交六十件，五月份交二十件。但是沈阳小型开关厂根本不按合同交货。原规定一月份交的二十件，到一月底还没交来。二月份，我们派专人去督促交货，他们今天推明天，明天推后天，从二月底推到三月五日，又从三月五日推到三月十五日，仍然不交货。
    为了这件事，我们厂曾给该厂和该厂的领导机关沈阳市电气工业公司打过十几次长途电话，去过九次公函，并指定一个专人在沈阳催了一个半月。他们见我们催问得紧了，就说：“我们接连试制几次都失败了，现在已转给春新工厂生产，要到四月底才能交货。”我厂驻沈人员要求到现场去看实际情况，他们始终不允许。三月十六日我们又派一个股长和一个技术员去交涉，才弄明真相：原来他们根本没有组织试制。所谓“试制几次失败”，全是骗人的。后来，经过该厂党委的支持，技术股牛股长组织技术员和老工人亲自动手，不过十天时间，就做好了二十台，质量很好。
    一月份的货算是交了，三月份应交的四十件，经我们一再催促，到四月十六日才交完。四月份应交六十件，到五月二十九日才交四十五件。五月份应交的二十件，又不知拖到什么时候才能交来？
    我们感到，沈阳小型开关厂不是缺乏技术，而是缺乏整体观念，缺乏为兄弟企业设身处地想一想的精神。我们希望这个厂的领导同志切实改掉这种不负责任的作风。
