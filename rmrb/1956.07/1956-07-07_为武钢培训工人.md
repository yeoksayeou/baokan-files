    Training Workers for Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation
    (Our dispatch) The Hubei Provincial Department of Transportation is actively training workers for the Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation. Since March of this year, 82 workers have been studying at the Hankou Automobile Repair Factory, Retreading Factory, and Maintenance Depot under the Department of Transportation. These include automobile repairmen, maintenance workers, electricians, copper workers, welders, tire workers, and machine tool operators.

    The training method generally adopted is the master-apprentice system, signing contracts, and guaranteeing teaching and learning. Currently, the Department of Transportation has formulated a specific training plan and issued notices to the factories responsible for the training, requiring them to pay special attention to this work.

    为武钢培训工人
    本报讯　湖北省公路厅积极为武汉钢铁公司培养工人。从今年三月开始已经有八十二名工人，分别在公路厅所属汉口汽车修配厂、翻胎厂、保养场学习。其中包括汽车修理工、保养工、电工、铜工、焊工、胎工、机床工等工种。按计划规定，这些工人到1957年8月将达到四级至五级工人的水平，可以单独进行操作。
    培训的方法一般采取师父带徒弟，签订合同、包教包学的办法，目前公路厅已经订出具体培训计划，并向负责培训的工厂发出通知，要求他们特别重视这一工作。
