Xinhua News Agency, 10th dispatch: Minister of Health Li Dequan stated at a symposium on nursing work on the 6th that the Ministry of Health is preparing to improve nursing work.

This symposium was convened by the Ministry of Health to understand the problems existing in nursing work. Nurse representatives from various hospitals in Beijing and representatives from the Chinese Nursing Association reflected at the symposium that: the health departments do not regard nurses as scientific and technical workers, and there is insufficient understanding of the importance of nursing work in medical work; the health departments do not pay enough attention to the learning and professional improvement of this group of more than hundreds of thousands of intellectuals—nurses. There is no certain promotion system for nurses, no clear requirements for nurses' professional skills, no clear goals for training nurses, and the overall level of nurses is not high; the health departments and medical units do not pay enough attention to nurses' living conditions and the physiological characteristics of female nurses; experienced senior nurses are not well placed; the hospital work system is unsound; nurses are not at ease in their work; and nursing accidents are increasing. According to statistics from hospitals under the jurisdiction of Beijing Municipality last year, nursing liability accidents accounted for 25% of all liability medical accidents, and nursing errors accounted for 60% of all medical and nursing errors. These problems urgently need to be resolved.

The nurses who participated in the symposium put forward many specific suggestions for improvement regarding these problems. Representatives from the Chinese Nursing Association suggested that the health departments should practically strengthen the management of nursing staff; improve the scientific nature of nursing work; improve nurses' living and political treatment; and organize specialized institutions to conduct in-depth investigations and analysis of the problems existing in nursing work and their solutions.

Li Dequan spoke at the end. She said that the Ministry of Health is confident that it will solve these problems existing in nursing work. She agreed that the Ministry of Health should organize a group to conduct a thorough investigation and research on these problems, and the Chinese Nursing Association should assist the Ministry of Health in doing this work well.

    卫生部准备改进护士工作
    召开座谈会听取护士对工作的意见
    新华社10日讯　卫生部长李德全六日在护士工作座谈会上表示，卫生部准备改进护士工作。
    这次座谈会是卫生部为了了解护士工作中存在的问题而召开的。北京各医院的护士代表和中华护士学会的代表在座谈会上反映：卫生部门没有把护士当作科学技术工作者看待，对于护理工作在医疗工作中的重要性认识不足；卫生部门对于为数十多万的这一批知识分子——护士的学习和业务水平的提高不够关心，护士没有一定的晋级制度，对护士的业务没有明确的要求，培养护士没有明确目标，护士水平一般不高；卫生部门和医疗单位对于护士的生活待遇和女护士的生理特点也注意得不够；对于有经验的老护士没有很好地安置；医院工作制度不健全；护士不安心工作；护理事故增多。据北京市属医院去年的统计，护理责任事故占全部责任医疗事故的25％，护理差错占全部医疗护理差错的60％。这些问题都急需解决。
    参加座谈会的护士们针对这些问题，提出了许多具体的改进意见。中华护士学会的代表建议卫生部门要切实加强对护理人员的管理工作；提高护理工作的科学性；改善护士的生活待遇和政治待遇；组织专门机构深入调查研究和分析护士工作存在的问题及其解决途径。
    李德全最后讲话。她说，卫生部有信心一定要解决护士工作中存在的这些问题，她同意由卫生部组织一个小组，对这些问题切实进行调查研究，中华护士学会应该协助卫生部做好这个工作。
