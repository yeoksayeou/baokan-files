    Mare Mule Foals
    (This report) According to our newspaper, a seven-year-old black-chestnut mare mule of the Wuyi Agricultural Production Cooperative, Mangzhibao Township, Liaozhong County, Liaoning Province, mated with a gray donkey in early July last year and gave birth to a foal on the evening of June 28 this year. This foal is 67 cm tall, 56 cm long, has a chest circumference of 64.7 cm, a cannon bone circumference (lower forelimb) of 9.2 cm, and a birth weight of 28 jin. The foaling process was normal, taking 20 minutes. The foal was able to stand one hour after birth and suckle normally. Both the large and small livestock are completely healthy. The masses in the nearby villages find this matter very rare and have come to the cooperative to visit and observe.

    本报讯　辽宁省辽中县忙植堡乡五一农业生产合作社的一头黑栗色的骒骡（七岁）在去年七月上旬，和一头灰叫驴交配，今年六月二十八日晚生产了一头幼驹。这头幼驹体高六十七公分，体长五十六公分，胸围六十四点七公分，管围（前肢下部）九点二公分，初生重二十八市斤。产驹时正常，在二十分钟内产出。幼驹在一小时后就能站立，吮乳正常。大小牲畜完全健康，附近各村群众都觉得这件事很稀奇，纷纷到这个社来参观。
