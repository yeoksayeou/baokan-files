　　The Little Girl Who Arrived by "Mail"
　　Lü Yongxuan
　　On May 6th, a little girl wearing a red scarf and colorful clothes suddenly arrived at the barracks of a People's Liberation Army unit stationed in Huiyang, Guangdong. She was carrying a large gourd filled with goose eggs and chicken eggs. In the backpack on her back, you could see pancakes and fried dough twists. The words "Lin Cuizhi" were written on the backpack, which was her name.

　　She entered the barracks looking for her parents. She said her father's name was Lin Jixiang and her mother's name was Xiao Yudi. But when she learned that her parents had been transferred, she became so anxious that she couldn't speak. The adjutant who received her asked, "How did you get here? Who brought you?" The little girl spoke in her local dialect, and all that could be understood vaguely was "Volunteer Army uncle bought me dough twists," "Auntie on the train fed me"... It seemed that this little girl was still quite naive!

　　Unexpectedly, the adjutant found a thick stack of letters in the little girl's backpack. Some of them read:

　　"Comrade Lin Jixiang: Your letter has been received. Regarding the issue of your little girl going to the army, we can introduce her to the conductors on the Andong-Beijing train and ask them to help take care of her. No need to worry. Andong Station Passenger Office."

　　"To the conductor of Train 14 from Andong: The little girl (over ten years old) of Lin Jixiang from the army is going from Andong to Zhangmutou. She is a child from the countryside and has never been out before. We hope you will take special care of her and ask the Fengtai station master to handle the transfer at the transfer station. Her travel expenses are eighty yuan, which will be used to purchase the ticket in Andong, leaving forty-three yuan, seven jiao, and eight fen. Andong Station Passenger Office. May 1st."

　　"We hope the conductor of Train 613 will purchase the Zhangmutou to Huiyang bus ticket on behalf of the girl, and that the Zhangmutou station master will handle all the bus boarding procedures and introduce the situation to the bus station for care along the way. After arriving in Huiyang, we hope the responsible comrade at the Huiyang Bus Station will transfer the little girl to the ×× Army Soldiers' Hostel. Attached is RMB 29 yuan, eight jiao, and three fen. Guangzhou Station Passenger Office."

　　"Everything is clear now," the adjutant said happily, "It turns out the little girl was mailed from the Northeast!" When the surrounding comrades heard that "a little girl was mailed," they all rushed to see her.

　　The good news phone call, after being transferred through several switchboards in the army, finally got through. Second Lieutenant Assistant Military Doctor Lin Jixiang was in the office when he suddenly received a call from his former unit saying, "Your little girl has arrived, come and pick her up." Instantly, Lin Jixiang and his wife smiled with relief.

　　And so, they were finally reunited with their daughter. Whenever they thought of this, they were filled with infinite pride and gratitude for their great motherland and for the respectable and lovable staff who were being nurtured by the motherland. (Attached picture)

    “邮”来的小姑娘
    吕永轩
    五月六日，驻守在广东惠阳的人民解放军某部营房里，忽然来了一位带红领巾、穿花衣服的小姑娘。她的手里提着一个大葫芦，里面装满了鹅蛋和鸡蛋；背上背的书包里还露着烧饼和油炸麻花。书包上写着“林萃芝”三个字，这就是她的名字。
    她进了营房就找她的爸爸妈妈。她说她爸爸叫林吉相，妈妈叫萧玉笛。可是当她知道爸爸、妈妈已调离工作的时候，便着急得说不出话来。接待她的助理员问她“怎样来的？谁送的？”小姑娘讲的是家乡土话，模模糊糊能听懂的，只是“志愿军叔叔给我买的麻花”，“车上阿姨领我吃饭”……。看来，这位小姑娘还不大懂事哩！
    意外地，助理员在小姑娘书包里，发现了厚厚一叠子信件。其中有几封是这样写的：
    “林吉相同志：来信收到。关于你的小女孩去部队问题，我们可以介绍给安东——北京间的乘务员，要他们协助照顾。不必挂念。安东站客运室。”
    “安东开十四次车长同志：部队林吉相的小女孩（十周岁多）由安东去樟木头。她是乡下小孩，没出过门，希望您特别照顾，到换车站求丰台站长代办一下。她的旅费八十元，由安东购票，剩下四十三元七角八分。安东站客运室。五月一日”
    “希望六一三次车长代购木樟头至惠阳汽车票，木樟头站长代办一切乘坐汽车的手续，并且将情况介绍给汽车站以便途中照顾。到达惠阳以后，希望惠阳汽车站负责同志将小女孩转送××部队军人招待所。附人民币二十九元八角三分。广州站客运室。”
    “一切全明白了”，助理员高兴地说：“原来小姑娘是从东北邮来的啊！”周围同志听说“邮来了个小姑娘”，都跑来争着看。
    报喜的电话经过部队几个总机的接转，最后终于打通了。少尉助理军医林吉相正在办公，忽然接到原部队电话说：“你的小女孩到了，快来接。”顿时，林吉相和她的爱人如释重负地笑了。
    就这样，他们和女儿终于团聚了。一想到这件事，他们就充满了对自己伟大的祖国，对祖国教养着的可敬可爱的工作人员的无限骄矜和感激。（附图片）
