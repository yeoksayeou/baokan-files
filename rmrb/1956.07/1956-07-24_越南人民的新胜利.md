    New Victory for the Vietnamese People
    Zhou Meisheng

    Just as the restoration of peace in Indochina celebrates its second anniversary, exciting news comes from North Vietnam. The Council of Ministers of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam announced in a communiqué on the 18th that the land reform work in North Vietnam has been basically completed. This is a new and significant victory for the Vietnamese people in their struggle against imperialism and feudalism.
    For thousands of years, Vietnam has been under the shackles of the feudal system. This system was an important cause of Vietnam's economic backwardness, the poverty of the people's lives, and the country's suffering from imperialist aggression. During the French invasion, the landlord class became the social pillar of colonial rule. Therefore, abolishing the feudal system and eliminating the landlord class became an important task of the Vietnamese national democratic revolution. Shortly after the establishment of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam in 1945, the People's Government promulgated a decree on rent reduction. In July 1949, the Vietnamese government promulgated another decree to distribute the land confiscated from French colonialists and Vietnamese traitors to landless or land-poor peasants. The French colonialists launched a new war of aggression in 1946, which delayed the implementation of social reforms in Vietnam. However, starting in May 1953, the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam carried out rent reduction movements in the liberated areas, and began land reform at the end of the same year. These efforts played a significant role in improving the lives of peasants, developing agricultural production, and mobilizing peasants to support the national liberation war. After the restoration of peace in Indochina in 1954, the land reform work in North Vietnam entered a new stage. Up to now, North Vietnam has carried out eight phases of rent reduction and five phases of land reform. With the exception of some ethnic minority areas, mountainous areas, and coastal areas, land reform in North Vietnam has been completed.
    The land reform struggle in North Vietnam was carried out during a period of intense warfare in the early stages, and the fifth phase of land reform, the largest in scale, was mainly carried out in newly liberated areas, which determined the complexity and arduousness of this struggle. However, because the elimination of feudal exploitation conformed to the fundamental interests and urgent desires of the peasant masses, this struggle was resolutely supported by the vast number of peasants. At the same time, the Vietnamese Workers' Party and the Republic's government formulated and implemented correct policies, carried out thorough ideological mobilization among the peasants, and mobilized a large number of cadres to organize and lead this struggle, thus ensuring the healthy development of the movement and achieving rapid and great victories.
    The victory of the anti-feudal struggle in North Vietnam has enormous historical significance, and it will play a major role in consolidating the North and realizing the struggle for a unified country. Through land reform, the basis for imperialist aggression and feudal relations of production have been completely and permanently eliminated, and the peasants have gained true liberation and become the masters of the land. This has greatly boosted the production enthusiasm of the vast number of peasants and opened up broad avenues for the development of agricultural production. Facts have proven that after land reform, the production investment of peasants in North Vietnam is increasing day by day, and this year's early rice crop has already achieved a bumper harvest. Nearly 60% of farm households have joined mutual aid teams. In the anti-feudal class struggle, the ideological consciousness of the peasant masses has been greatly improved, the grassroots organizations in rural areas have been consolidated and developed, and counter-revolutionaries and bad elements have been severely打击daji (struck at), all of which have further consolidated the people's democratic system in North Vietnam. At present, profound changes are taking place in the face of rural areas and society in North Vietnam. The prosperity and progress of North Vietnam will not only consolidate the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, but will also have a tremendous impact on the people in the South.

    越南人民的新胜利
    周梅生
    正当印度支那和平恢复两周年的时候，越南北方又传来令人振奋的捷报。越南民主共和国部长会议在十八日发表的公报中宣布了，越南北方的土地改革工作已经基本上完成了。这是越南人民在反帝反封建的斗争中所获得的新的重大的胜利。
    几千年以来，越南一直处在封建制度的束缚之下。这种制度是越南经济落后、人民生活贫困和国家遭受帝国主义侵略的重要原因。在法国侵略期间，地主阶级又成为殖民统治的社会支柱。因此，废除封建制度和消灭地主阶级就成为越南民族民主革命的重要任务。1945年越南民主共和国成立后不久，人民政府便颁布了减租法令。1949年7月，越南政府又颁布法令，将没收法国殖民者和越奸的土地，分给无地或少地的贫农。1946年法国殖民者发动了新的侵略战争，因而使越南的社会改革推迟进行。但是从1953年5月开始，越南民主共和国政府便在解放区进行了减租运动，并从同年年底开始进行土地改革。这些工作对于改善农民生活、发展农业生产和动员农民支援民族解放战争起了重大的作用。1954年印度支那和平恢复后，越南北方的土地改革工作进入了新的阶段。到现在为止，越南北方共进行了八期减租和五期土地改革，除了部分少数民族地区、山区和沿海地区外，越南北方的土地改革已经完成了。
    越南北方的土地改革斗争，前几期是在激烈的战争期间进行的，而规模最大的第五期土地改革的地区主要是新解放区，这就决定了这一斗争的复杂性和艰巨性。但是，由于消灭封建剥削符合农民群众的根本利益和迫切愿望，这个斗争得到广大农民的坚决拥护。同时，越南劳动党和共和国政府制定和执行了正确的政策，在农民中进行了深入的思想发动工作，动员了大批干部组织和领导这一斗争，因而保证了运动的健康发展，并获得迅速的巨大的胜利。
    越南北方反封建斗争的胜利具有巨大的历史意义，它对于巩固北方和实现统一国家的斗争将起重大的作用。经过土地改革，帝国主义者侵略的依据和封建的生产关系彻底地永远地被消灭了，农民获得了真正的解放，成为土地的主人。这就大大地鼓舞了广大农民的生产热情，为发展农业生产开辟了广阔的道路。事实已经证明，在土地改革以后，越南北方农民的生产投资正在日益增加，今年的夏稻已经获得丰收。将近60％的农户已经参加了互助组。在反封建的阶级斗争中，农民群众的思想觉悟大大提高，农村中的基层组织得到巩固和发展，反革命分子和坏分子遭到沉重的打击，所有这些，都使越南北方的人民民主制度进一步获得巩固。目前，越北农村和社会的面貌正在发生深刻的变化。越南北方的繁荣和进步，不仅将使越南民主共和国日益巩固，而且必将在南方人民中发生巨大的影响。
