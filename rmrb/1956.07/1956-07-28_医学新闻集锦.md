    Medical News Roundup
    Dr. Zhang Fuxing of Xi'an has created a surgery to treat high myopia—scleral shortening. This surgery shortens the sclera by means of resection, restoring normal vision. Since 1954, he has performed five cases. The surgical process is very safe, and the initial results of the treatment show that vision has improved in four cases, and there was no improvement in one case; the refractive error was reduced in all five cases; and the fundus of the eye showed a healthier condition in all five cases. In the past, the general method for treating high myopia was wearing glasses. In addition, although Fukada's lens surgery sometimes has significant effects, it is very risky, so it is rarely used.

    According to the research of Dr. Chen Xiangjie of Shanghai, acupuncture therapy is very effective for acute tonsillitis, with a short course of treatment, and it is simple and economical. They treated forty-two patients with acupuncture, and forty-one cases recovered on average in 2.5 to 2.6 days, and one case was ineffective. The number of acupuncture treatments was generally two to three times.
    Dr. Li Baoshi of Shanghai, based on the crushing-cutting technique, improved the instrument for removing tonsils and created a bloodless tonsil crushing-cutting technique and instrument. His method is to thicken the blade of the crushing-cutter, abolish the cutting action, and make it clamp the root of the tonsil for a few minutes after squeezing the tonsil into the instrument to exert a hemostatic effect. Then, use an electrocautery to cut off the tonsil at the distal end of the clamped part, so that bloodless surgery can be completed.

    After years of research, microbiologist Tang Feifan isolated a virus from the trachoma of Chinese people for the first time, proving that the trachoma of Chinese people is caused by the same virus as trachoma patients in the Americas, Japan, and other places.

    The Central Institute of Skin and Venereal Diseases used traditional Chinese medicine fumigation therapy to treat forty cases of neurodermatitis. Preliminary results show that the cure rate reached 82.5%, itching was quickly relieved, the treatment course was not long, the method was simple, and there were few serious reactions. The doctors at the institute believe that traditional Chinese medicine fumigation therapy may have broad application prospects in the field of dermatology and is worthy of further research.

    西安张福星医师创造了一种治疗高度近视眼的手术——巩膜缩短术。这种手术是用切除办法使巩膜缩短，使视力恢复正常。他自1954年以来，施行了五个病例，手术过程很安全，治疗的初步结果，四例视力都有进步，一例无进步；屈光度五例都减低；五例眼底都呈现比较健康的状况。过去治疗高度近视的一般方法是戴眼镜，此外，用富卡达（Fukada）氏晶体术虽然有时有显著效果，但危险性很大，所以很少采用。

    据上海陈湘杰医师的研究，针灸疗法对急性扁桃体炎疗效很显著，疗程短，而且简便经济。他们用针灸治疗了四十二个患者，四十一例平均在二点五到二点六天内痊愈，一例无效，针灸次数一般是二到三次。
    上海李宝实医师以挤切术为基础，把切除扁桃体的器械加以改进，创造了一种可以不出血的扁桃体挤切术和器械。他的办法是把挤切器的刀刃加厚，废除割裂作用，使它把扁桃体挤入器械内以后而挟紧扁桃体的根部几分钟，以发挥止血作用，随后再用电刀在挟住部位的远端切除扁桃体，因此可以完成无血手术。
