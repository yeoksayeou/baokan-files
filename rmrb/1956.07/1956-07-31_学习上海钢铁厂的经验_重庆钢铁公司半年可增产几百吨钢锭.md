Learning from the Experience of Shanghai Steel Plants

Chongqing Iron and Steel Company Can Increase Steel Ingot Production by Several Hundred Tons in Half a Year

(According to Chongqing Daily) In early July, the learning group from the small steelmaking workshop of Chongqing Iron and Steel Company returned from studying at Shanghai No. 1 and No. 3 Steel Plants. They introduced the advanced experience of Shanghai Steel Plants in sintering furnace bottoms. Yang Shaoqing, a furnace maintenance technician, organized the furnace maintenance cadres to study. In mid-July, the experience of Shanghai Steel Plants was adopted on two small open-hearth furnaces, continuously creating new records of 2.10 and 2.13 minutes for sintering furnace bottoms, shortening the time by 12 minutes compared to the highest achievement in November last year, and shortening the average time by about half compared to the first half of this year. The saved furnace patching time alone can increase the country's steel ingot production by several hundred tons in the second half of the year.

    重庆钢铁公司半年可增产几百吨钢锭
    据重庆日报讯　七月上旬，重庆钢铁公司小型炼钢车间的学习小组从上海一、三钢铁厂学习回来，介绍了上海钢铁厂烧结炉底的先进经验，护炉技师杨绍卿组织了护炉干部学习。七月中旬，在两座小平炉上采用了上海钢铁厂的经验，连续创造烧结炉底二点十分和二点十三分新纪录，比去年十一月最高成绩缩短十二分，比今年上半年平均时间缩短约一半。仅节省的烧补时间，下半年就可为国家增产几百吨钢锭。
