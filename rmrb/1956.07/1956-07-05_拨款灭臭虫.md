This newspaper, Shanghai, 3rd dispatch:

    The Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions has allocated 150,000 yuan this summer to subsidize workers with difficulties in purchasing medicine to eradicate bedbugs, so that they can sleep well on summer nights.
    In the past, many workers could not sleep well at night due to the large number of bedbugs in their dormitories, and often dozed off while working the next day. Some workers, afraid of being bitten by bedbugs, had to leave their dormitories and sleep in the open air, often catching cold and getting sick as a result. Now that the bedbugs in the workers' dormitories have been eliminated, everyone can sleep well, and they are even more motivated to produce the next day.

    拨款灭臭虫
    本报上海3日电　上海市工会联合会在今年夏季拨款十五万元，补助给有困难的职工购买扑灭臭虫药物，让职工在夏夜好好睡觉。
    过去，许多职工由于宿舍里臭虫很多，夜里不能很好地睡觉，第二天生产的时候经常打瞌睡。有的职工因为怕臭虫咬，只得离开宿舍睡到露天去，经常为此受凉生病。现在，职工宿舍里的臭虫消灭了，大家都能睡好觉，第二天生产的劲头更足了。
