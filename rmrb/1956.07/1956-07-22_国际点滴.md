	International Snippets
		Television Sets Replace Teachers
	In the United States, there is a serious shortage of teachers. According to the July 1st issue of "U.S. News & World Report," Harford County in western Maryland will use television sets to teach some courses in elementary schools starting this fall. Educators will draw experience from this experiment to see if television sets can be used to replace teachers, in order to solve the current difficulty of teacher shortage.
		Universities and Stocks
	In the money-worshipping United States, universities and stock exchanges are also closely linked. Boston's Vance, Sanders & Company recently surveyed the endowments of forty-two of the most important universities. According to the company, 56% of these universities' endowments are in common company stocks, 29.1% in securities, 5.8% in preferred stocks, and the remaining 6.4% in real estate and factory investments.
		Robbery Practice
	The University of Kentucky in the United States recently expelled four students. According to the school, these four students were determined to become notorious thieves. Therefore, in their first semester of freshman year, they, along with two companions from outside the school, exploded several bombs in student dormitories, stole things from vending machines on campus thirty-one times, sold drugs, and practiced shoplifting in Lexington.

    国际点滴
        电视机代替教员
    在美国，教员缺乏的情况很严重，据七月一期的“美国新闻与世界报道”说，西部马里兰州的哈哲斯城，从今年秋天起，小学里一部分课程的教学工作，将采用电视机来进行，教育家们将从这个实验中得出经验，看能不能利用电视机代替教员，以便解决目前教员缺乏的困难。
        大学和股票
    在金元美国，大学和股票交易所也有密切联系。波斯顿的温士—山德斯公司，最近调查了四十二所最主要的大学的校产，据这家公司说，在这些大学的校产中，56％是普通的公司股票，29.1％是证券，5.8％是优先股票，另外的6.4％为不动产和工厂投资。
        抢劫的实习
    美国肯塔基大学在不久以前开除了四名学生。据校方宣布，这四个学生决心成为有名的大盗。因此，他们在一年级的第一学期中，就同他们校外的两个同伴一起，在学生宿舍里爆炸了几个炸弹，在校内的自动售货机里偷了三十一次东西，出售毒物，并且在列克辛顿进行了抢劫商铺的实习。
