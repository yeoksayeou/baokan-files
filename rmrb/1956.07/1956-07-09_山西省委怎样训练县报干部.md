How the Shanxi Provincial Party Committee Trains County Newspaper Cadres
Lin Jinghua

The Propaganda Department of the Shanxi Provincial Party Committee held a training class for county newspaper editors from December of last year to January of this year. Through this short-term training method, county newspaper editors received a relatively concentrated and systematic education in journalism and improved their editing skills.

A total of 223 people participated in this training, one-third of whom were original county newspaper editors, and two-thirds of whom were newly assigned editors. Among these newly assigned personnel, the majority lacked understanding of newspaper work, and even looked down on county newspaper work. Some people thought: "County newspapers are small newspapers, not important, and have no future," saying that "being a county newspaper editor has no power, no fame, and no future." Some of the original county newspaper editors also had the idea of ​​belittling county newspaper work. In particular, some county newspaper editors-in-chief believed that they were "wasting their talents" and were not as good as being a former deputy minister of the county party committee or secretary of the district party committee. In response to these erroneous ideological understandings, on the one hand, the lecturers focused on explaining the important role and status of newspapers in the national construction cause through teaching courses, and recounted the fine tradition of our party's consistent emphasis on newspaper work, as well as the fact that "large newspapers" and "small newspapers" are only different in division of labor, and there is no distinction between important and unimportant in work; on the other hand, they also used various activities of group discussions and the organizational life of students to encourage them to carry out criticism and self-criticism, and criticize various viewpoints on fame and position. After this kind of study and discussion, the vast majority of students improved their ideological awareness and increased their interest in doing county newspaper work. Many people said: "We must ensure that we study hard and run the county newspaper well after we go back."

Shanxi's county newspapers began to be established one after another in 1939, and some county newspapers have accumulated certain experience in running newspapers. However, due to a lack of clear understanding of the nature, principles, and tasks of county newspapers in the past, the improvement and improvement of county newspapers has generally been relatively slow. In order to solve this problem, this training class first explained the basic principles of party newspapers (including a brief history of the party's newspapers and periodicals) and ten special topics related to county newspaper work, namely: county newspaper commentary work, county newspaper news reporting, county newspaper rural economic reporting, county newspaper party life propaganda, county newspaper current affairs and political propaganda, carrying out criticism and self-criticism in county newspapers, county newspaper mass work, county newspaper popularization issues, county newspaper editing work, and county newspaper writing style and writing work. Then, the students were organized to seriously study the "Decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on Improving Newspaper Work," the "Decision of the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China on Improving Shanxi Daily and Shanxi Peasant Daily," and the "Decision of the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China on Improving County Newspaper Work (Draft)." At the same time, on the basis of the above study, the shortcomings and problems in the past county newspaper work were examined. From the examination materials, some county newspapers in the past stipulated that their task was only to "exchange experiences and promote production movement," and lacked a clear view of educating the masses with socialist principles. Some narrowly understood the education of the people as merely the propaganda and explanation of central work and specific policies, while ignoring the propaganda of the party's basic principles and the party's leadership role. Some published too many instructions, resolutions, meeting materials, and reports of leading cadres from leading organs, and reprinted too many manuscripts from large newspapers, resulting in a tendency of "running small newspapers in a big way" and being divorced from the local reality and the masses. After the students analyzed and studied the nature, principles, tasks, and characteristics of county newspapers based on the spirit of the documents, they clearly realized that the basic task of county newspapers is to conduct socialist education among the people, and to strive to achieve mass character and popularization. Some students reflected after studying: "In the past, we did it right without realizing it; we did it wrong without knowing why. After studying, our eyes are bright, our minds are clear, and we also have methods."

Summarizing and exchanging the work experience of county newspapers in various places is also an important part of this training class. Among the ninety-five county newspapers in Shanxi Province, about 20% are run relatively well, 50% are average, and 30% are not run well enough. But whether they are run well or not well enough, they all have more or less good experience. In order to make the study of business theory related to practice, and to turn the experience of one newspaper in one aspect into a more complete experience for everyone, this training class organized twenty-four county newspaper editors to give experience presentations at the student conference. Some of these experiences belong to the propaganda and reporting aspects of newspapers, and some belong to the work of the editorial department. Through these experience introductions, the students affirmed the correct things in the past work, criticized the incorrect things, learned many specific methods of running newspapers, and also strengthened their determination and confidence in running newspapers.

This training class also organized students to preliminarily study the long-term plan for county newspaper work in the province. Such as the long-term plan for county newspapers in the next seven years in terms of layout, publication frequency, circulation, cadre allocation, correspondent network, etc., and also studied the scope of responsibilities of the editor-in-chief and general editors of county newspapers, and the work system for eliminating errors in newspapers. These study contents also have practical help in improving the students' work level.

The training class held by the Propaganda Department of the Shanxi Provincial Party Committee was conducted on the basis of studying county newspapers in various places and understanding the work and ideological conditions of county newspaper personnel in the past year. As introduced above, this training has improved the understanding level and business ability of the vast majority of county newspaper editors in the province. In this way, it has directly promoted the improvement of county newspaper work. According to the inspection of county newspaper work in the province by the Shanxi Provincial Party Committee from February to April this year, the newspapers in various counties have made relatively significant improvements in both content and form, and the circulation of newspapers has doubled compared with last year. Although this improvement has many reasons, it is closely related to the holding of this training class. Naturally, the training and cultivation of county newspaper personnel is not limited to holding training classes, and can also take various forms. For example, county newspaper editors can be organized to intern and visit the provincial party committee's organ newspaper or the provincial and prefectural peasant newspapers, send them to appropriate classes in the CCP Party School to study, and strengthen learning and training in their work. In order to continuously improve county newspaper work, the Shanxi Provincial Party Committee will continue to use other methods in addition to continuing to hold training classes to cultivate and improve county newspaper editors in the future.

    山西省委怎样训练县报干部
    林菁华
    中共山西省委宣传部在去年十二月到今年一月的期间，举办了一期全省县报编辑人员训练班。通过这种短期的训练方式，使县报编辑人员受到了一次比较集中而系统的新闻业务教育，提高了编辑工作的能力。
    参加这次训练的共223人，其中三分之一是原来的县报编辑，三分之二是新调配的编辑人员。在这些新调配的人员当中，大多数对报纸工作缺乏认识，甚至轻视县报工作。有人认为：
  “县报是小报，不重要，没搞头”，说“当县报编辑无权、无名，无前途”。一部分原来的县报编辑也有轻视县报工作的思想。特别是有些县报主编，认为自己是“大材小用”，不如原来当县委副部长或区委书记好。针对这些错误的思想认识，一方面，讲师们通过讲授课程，着重说明报纸在国家建设事业中的重要作用和地位，讲述了我们党一贯重视报纸工作的优良传统，以及“大报”和“小报”只是分工的不同，在工作上并没有重要和不重要的区别；另一方面，又通过小组讨论和学员的组织生活的各种活动，启发他们开展批评和自我批评，批判各种名位观点。经过这种种学习讨论之后，绝大多数学员都提高了思想觉悟，增加了做县报工作的兴趣。许多人表示：“一定要保证学好，回去后把县报办好。”
    山西的县报是从1939年开始陆续创办的，有些县报已经积累了一定的办报经验。但是由于过去对县报的性质、方针和任务认识不够明确，县报的提高和改进一般都比较缓慢。为了解决这一问题，在这期训练班中首先讲解了党报的基本原则（包括党的报刊简史）和有关县报工作的十个专题，即：县报的评论工作、县报的新闻报道、县报的农村经济报道、县报的党的生活宣传、县报的时事政治宣传、开展县报上的批评和自我批评、县报的群众工作、县报的通俗化问题、县报的编辑工作和县报的文风和文字工作。接着，又组织学员认真地学习了中共中央关于改进报纸工作的决议、中共山西省委关于改进山西日报、山西农民报的决定和中共山西省委关于改进县报工作的决定（草案）。同时在上述学习的基础上，检查了过去县报工作中的缺点和问题，从检查的材料来看，有些县报过去规定自己的任务仅仅是“交流经验，推动生产运动”，而缺乏明确的以社会主义原则教育群众的观点。有的则把对人民群众的教育，狭隘地仅仅理解为对中心工作和各项具体政策的宣传解释，而忽视了对党的基本原则和党的领导作用的宣传。有的是过多地刊登领导机关的指示、决议、会议材料以及领导干部的报告，过多地转载大报的稿件，以致形成“小报大办”、脱离当地的实际和群众的倾向。当学员们根据文件的精神，分析研究了县报的性质、方针、任务和县报的特点以后，就明确认识到县报的基本任务是向人民群众进行社会主义教育，并且要力求作到群众化和通俗化。有些学员在学习后反映：“过去作对了，不自觉；作错了，也不知道为什么。经过学习，眼睛明亮了，头脑清楚了，也有办法了。”
    总结和交流各地县报的工作经验，也是这次训练班的一个重要内容。在山西省的九十五个县报当中，大约有20％是办的比较好的，有50％是一般的，有30％是办的不够好的。但是无论是办的好的或是不够好的，他们都有或多或少的好的经验。这次训练班为了使业务理论的学习能够联系实际，为了把一个报纸一个方面的经验变成大家所有的比较完整的经验，就组织了二十四个县报编辑人员在学员大会上分别作了经验介绍。这些经验有的是属于报纸宣传报道方面的，有的是属于编辑部工作方面的。学员们通过这些经验介绍，肯定了过去工作中的正确的东西，批判了不正确的东西，学到了许多办报的具体方法，也坚定了办报的决心和信心。
    这期训练班还组织学员初步研究了全省县报工作的长期规划。如县报在今后七年内的版面、刊期、发行份数、干部配备、通讯员网等等远景规划，也研究了县报的主编和一般编辑人员的职责范围、消灭报纸上的错误等工作制度。这些学习内容，对于提高学员的工作水平，也有实际的帮助。
    山西省委宣传部举办的这期训练班，是在去年一年研究各地县报、了解县报人员工作和思想情况的基础上进行的。正像上面所介绍的，这期训练使全省绝大多数的县报编辑人员的认识水平和业务能力都有了提高。这样，也就直接推动了县报工作的改进。据今年二月到四月份山西省委对全省县报工作的检查，各县的报纸不论在内容和形式上都有比较显著的改进，报纸发行数比去年增加了一倍。这种改进虽然有着多方面的原因，但同这次训练班的举办，却有密切的关系。自然，训练和培养县报人员不仅限于举办训练班，还可以采取多种多样的方式。例如可以组织县报编辑人员到省委机关报或省和专区的农民报纸实习和参观，送他们入中共党校适当的班次学习，以及在工作中加强学习和锻炼等等。山西省委为了不断地改进县报工作，今后除继续举办训练班以外，还将采用别的方式，来培养和提高县报编辑人员。
