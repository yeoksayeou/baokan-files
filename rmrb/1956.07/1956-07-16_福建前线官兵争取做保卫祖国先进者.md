Xinhua News Agency, Fujian Front, July 14th: The officers and soldiers of all branches of the Chinese People's Liberation Army on the Fujian Front are striving to become "advanced elements in defending the socialist construction of the motherland."

　　The infantry units guarding the coast have recently produced a large number of excellent sharpshooters and units with excellent shooting results. The forward artillery and anti-aircraft artillery units have also produced a new batch of "all-round gunners" and "technical experts." The Eighth Company of a certain anti-aircraft artillery unit completed one and a half months of training tasks in four weeks.

　　New heroic deeds have also emerged in combat. Liu Runxing, the captain of a certain naval patrol boat, led his sailors in an air battle, fighting against twelve Chiang Kai-shek planes along with fraternal boats. He insisted on commanding despite being seriously injured, shooting down and damaging one Chiang Kai-shek plane each.

　　In the rear of the battle line, automobile drivers put forward the slogan "Defend the motherland, drive safely, and save fuel." Sixteen new soldiers, including Liu Shanxian, learned general driving skills in twenty-seven days and became automobile soldiers. The cooks of a certain unit researched and created a method of reducing the amount of firewood burned per person per day from thirty-six taels to eighteen taels.

    福建前线官兵争取做保卫祖国先进者
    据新华社福建前线14日电　福建前线中国人民解放军各兵种部队的官兵们，都在为争取做一个“保卫祖国社会主义建设先进分子”而努力。
    守卫在海防线上的步兵部队，最近出现了大批的优秀射手和射击成绩优秀的单位。前沿炮兵和高射炮兵部队也出现一批新的“全能炮手”和“技术能手”。某高射炮兵部队第八连四个星期完成了一个半月的训练任务。
    在战斗中也出现了一些新的英雄事迹。某海军巡逻艇艇长刘润兴率领他的水兵在一次对空作战中，和兄弟艇一起与十二架蒋机战斗，他身负重伤仍坚持指挥，击落、击伤蒋机各一架。
    在战线的后方，汽车驾驶员提出“保卫祖国，安全行车，节约油料”的口号。新战士刘善仙等十六人，二十七天学会一般的驾驶技术，成了汽车驾驶兵。某部炊事兵研究创造出每人每天烧柴量由三十六两降低到十八两。
