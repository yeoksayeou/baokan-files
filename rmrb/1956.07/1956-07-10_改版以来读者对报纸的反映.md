Readers: Editor

Letters from readers Guo Renfu, Zhang Shen, Sun Baiheng, Xu Hansheng, Wu Huamou, Jing Yi, Ye Dan, Chu Yukun, and forty-three others express welcome and support for the three aspects of improvement proposed in the newspaper's July 1st editorial "To Our Readers": expanding coverage, promoting free discussion, and improving writing style. Chu Yukun believes that "this is the wish of readers for many years." Guo Renfu's letter also hopes that readers, authors, and all those who care about the newspaper will carefully read this editorial and give the newspaper editorial department more support and help.

In their letters, many readers welcomed the newspaper's use of various forms to publish readers' letters on various pages. For example, Liu Hongchen wrote: "The mass voices published in the July 2nd newspaper are only a little over a hundred words each, and people like to read them." Some readers are very interested in some short essays and miscellaneous articles published in the newspaper and hope that the authors will write more of these articles. Liu Zuquan of the History Department of Beijing Normal University wrote: "The article 'Discussion on the Periodization of Slavery and Feudalism in Chinese History' on the seventh page of the July 4th newspaper is of great help to our study of the history of our motherland. We very much hope that there will also be special articles to comment on the long-debated issues of the sprouts of Chinese capitalism and the periodization of modern Chinese history."

In their letters, some readers put forward some suggestions to the editorial department: Jing Yi hopes that the newspaper will often publish some wonderful comic strips; Xu Hansheng hopes that the newspaper will publish more science news and scientific papers; Wu Huamou, a Dong student at the Central University for Nationalities, hopes that the newspaper will pay attention to strengthening the publicity of the situation of all ethnic groups.

    改版以来读者对报纸的反映
    读者郭仁福、张深、孙白珩、徐汉生、伍华谋、璟漪、叶丹、储玉坤等四十三人来信，对本报七月一日社论“致读者”所提出的今后将着重从扩大报道范围、开展自由讨论、改进文风等三方面来改进工作，表示欢迎和支持。储玉坤认为“这是读者多年来的愿望”，郭仁福的来信中，还希望读者、作者和一切关心报纸的人，都认真地读这篇社论，给报纸编辑部更多的支持和帮助。
    在来信中，很多读者表示欢迎报纸各个版采用各种形式发表读者的来信，如刘洪晨来信说：“七月二
  日报纸上发表的群众呼声，每篇只有一百多字，人们都喜欢看。”有些读者对报纸上发表的一些短论和杂文，很感兴趣，希望作者多写这类文章。北京师范大学历史系刘佐泉来信说：“七月四日报纸第七版‘关于中国历史上的奴隶制和封建制分期问题的讨论’一文，对我们学习祖国历史有很大帮助。我们非常希望争论已久的关于中国资本主义萌芽问题和关于中国近代史分期问题，也有专门的文章来加以评述。”
    在来信中，有些读者对编辑部提出了一些建议：璟漪希望报纸经常登载些精彩的连环画；徐汉生希望报纸多登载些科学新闻和科学论文；中央民族学院侗族学员伍华谋希望报纸注意加强对各兄弟民族情况的宣传。
