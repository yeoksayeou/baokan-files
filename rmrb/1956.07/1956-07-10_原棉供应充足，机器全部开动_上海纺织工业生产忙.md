Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, July 7th (Xinhua Reporter Wen Jing): Thanks to the ample supply of raw cotton this year, all spindles and looms in Shanghai are operating. In the first half of the year, the output of cotton yarn from state-owned and joint state-private cotton textile factories in the city increased by 25% to 30% compared with the same period last year. This is an unprecedented scene in Shanghai's textile industry.

The quality of raw cotton is also relatively good this year, with most of the cotton fibers being over an inch long and the cotton wadding being white and tidy. It is easier to spin yarn with such cotton. The quality of yarn and cloth has also greatly improved, becoming stronger and more durable than in the past.

In previous years, raw cotton supplies would fall short every third quarter, and yarn and cloth production would routinely be reduced. However, at present, the warehouses of both raw cotton supply departments and textile factories are piled high with cotton. The existing cotton can supply production until two months after the new cotton comes on the market. Therefore, the planned output of yarn and cloth for the third quarter of this year is higher than the output for the third quarter of any previous year.

    原棉供应充足，机器全部开动
    上海纺织工业生产忙
    新华社上海7日电　新华社记者文静报道：由于今年原棉供应充足，上海市所有的纱锭和布机都开动起来了。上半年全市国营和公私合营棉纺织厂的棉纱产量比去年同期增加二成半到三成，这是上海纺织工业从来没有的景象。
    今年原棉的质量也比较好，绝大部分棉花的纤维有一吋多长，棉絮洁白整齐。用这样的棉花纺纱比较省力。纱布的质量也有很大改进，比过去更加结实耐用。
    往年每到第三季度，原棉就供应不上，纱布照例要减产，但是目前原棉供应部门和纺织工厂的仓库里都堆满了棉花。现存的棉花可以供应到新棉上市以后两个月。因此今年第三季度纱布的计划产量，比以往任何一年第三季度的产量要多。
