Xinhua News Agency, June 28th, London: The seventh Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference since the end of World War II held its first plenary session on June 27th at the British Cabinet Office. The meeting was held in secret. A communique issued after the meeting stated that the Prime Ministers generally discussed the international situation.

According to Western news agencies, individuals who attended the meeting revealed afterward that in his opening remarks, Eden said he believed the meeting was "part of a long-term process of building a bridge between the two major powers dividing the world (the Soviet Union and the United States)," a process that began with the Geneva Four-Power Summit last year, his trip to Washington in January and February this year, and the visit of Soviet leaders to London in April. Eden said that to build this bridge, he hoped to visit Washington again after the US presidential election and to convene another "top-level" meeting between major powers next year.

Eden made an assessment of the international situation. He reiterated the view that the so-called hydrogen bomb is a "deterrent" to prevent the outbreak of a major war, and in assessing Soviet policy, he said that we are now entering an era of competition for countries in Europe, Asia, and Africa that do not participate in blocs. Based on this argument, Eden called on Commonwealth countries to gradually reduce conventional armaments and use the savings for basic production so that the Commonwealth could become a huge "third economic force" in world affairs.

He said that this would enable the Commonwealth to help the United States and Russia get closer, while also being able to deal with the Soviet Union's economic challenge of "competitive coexistence." If this is not done, the Commonwealth risks failure in the new trade war.

He mentioned the UK's announcement of military spending cuts the day before the conference opened, saying that the UK had set an example. He also said that the UK hopes to further significantly reduce the budget for conventional armaments, while retaining the hydrogen bomb. However, in doing so, it hopes to consult with other Commonwealth countries and allies in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.

Indian Prime Minister Nehru also made an assessment of Soviet policy, affirming its peaceful nature. He believed that countries outside the socialist camp must find ways to achieve vigorous coexistence with this camp.

According to Agence France-Presse, Canadian Prime Minister St. Laurent's position was somewhat different from that of Eden and Nehru. He expressed some skepticism about Soviet policy.

The conference is scheduled to last for ten days.

Xinhua News Agency, June 29th, London: The Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference continued to hold a plenary session on the morning of June 28th to discuss the international situation. The meeting particularly focused on the UK's relations with the Soviet Union and the United States.

According to official sources after the meeting, Commonwealth Prime Ministers supported British Prime Minister Eden's proposal to make the Commonwealth a so-called "mediator" between the United States and the Soviet Union.

Western news agencies reported that there were disagreements at the meeting on issues such as the assessment of Soviet policy, the true basis of peaceful coexistence, and the policies that countries outside the socialist camp should follow, but everyone agreed that the danger of war had decreased. Most Prime Ministers acknowledged that the Soviet Union does not want a world war.

Indian Prime Minister Nehru emphasized that war "is not inevitable" and called for sincere cooperation with the Soviet Union. He pointed out that India's experience proves that maintaining normal relations with the Soviet Union is possible.

The London "Daily Worker," citing sources from Conservative Party figures, said that Nehru also called for the admission of China to the United Nations and for action to make the world more peaceful. He suggested halting hydrogen bomb tests and concentrating on using atomic energy for industrial purposes.

The British Labour Party's "Daily Herald" said that Nehru also believed that "the Commonwealth's attitude towards current (military) alliances should be decisively reconsidered." This proposal was supported by Ceylon Prime Minister Bandaranaike.

According to Western news agencies, Canadian Prime Minister St. Laurent believed that one should not automatically view all Russian actions from the perspective of the Cold War. But he also said that the West should not completely change its policies.

Agence France-Presse said that Eden's views "seem to fall between" Nehru and St. Laurent.

Commonwealth figures said that most Prime Ministers believe that the struggle between the socialist and non-socialist camps in the future will be an economic struggle. Some Prime Ministers believe that if the West wants to win this struggle, it must increase the speed and amount of "aid" to industrially backward countries.

On the afternoon of June 28th, the Commonwealth Prime Ministers held separate talks. According to Western news agencies, Nehru and Eden exchanged views on their perceptions of the Soviet Union, the Middle East issue, and the Indochina issue. This was Nehru's second meeting with Eden since his arrival in London. Australian Prime Minister Menzies also discussed trade issues with Eden.

    英联邦各国总理会商国际局势
    一致赞成英联邦应充当美苏桥梁
    艾登希望明年再开一次大国首脑会议
    据新华社28日讯　伦敦消息：第二次世界大战结束后的第七次英联邦总理会议，六月二十七日在英国内阁办公厅举行了第一次全体会议。会议是秘密进行的。会后发表的公报说：总理们一般地讨论了国际局势。
    据西方通讯社消息，参加会议的人士在会后透露：艾登在致开幕词的时候说，他认为这次会议是“在使世界陷于分裂的两个大国（苏联和美国）之间建造桥梁的长期过程的一部分”，这个过程是从去年日内瓦四国首脑会议、今年一二月间他的华盛顿之行和四月间苏联领导人的伦敦之行开始的。艾登说，为了建造这种桥梁，他希望在美国总统选举之后再次访问华盛顿，而且在明年再召开一次大国之间的“最高级”会议。
    艾登对国际局势作了一番估计。他重申所谓氢弹是防止大战爆发的“威慑力量”的观点，并且在估计苏联的政策的时候说，目前将要进入一个为争取欧洲、亚洲和非洲不参加集团的国家而展开竞争的时代。根据这种论点，艾登要求英联邦各国逐步缩减常规军备，而把节省下来的力量用到基本生产方面去，以便使英联邦能够成为世界事务中一支巨大的“第三种经济力量”。
    他说，这样就会使英联邦能够帮助美国和俄国更加接近，同时可以对付苏联的“竞赛共处”的经济挑战。如果不这样做，英联邦在新的贸易战争中就有失败的危险。
    他提到英国在这次会议开幕前一天宣布削减军费这件事，表示英国已经树立了榜样。他还说，英国希望在保有氢弹的条件下，进一步大大削减常规军备的预算。但是，在这样做的时候，它希望同英联邦其他国家以及北大西洋集团的盟国磋商。
    印度总理尼赫鲁也对苏联的政策作了估计，肯定了这种政策的和平性质。他认为，社会主义阵营以外的国家必须设法同这个阵营实行有生气的共处。
    据法新社报道，加拿大总理圣劳伦的立场同艾登和尼赫鲁的立场有些不同。他对苏联的政策表示了某些怀疑。
    这次会议预定将进行十天。
    新华社29日讯　伦敦消息：英联邦总理会议在六月二十八日上午继续举行全体会议，讨论国际局势。会议特别着重讨论了英国同苏联和美国的关系。
    据官方人士在会后说，英联邦各国总理支持英国首相艾登要使英联邦成为美国和苏联之间的所谓“调解人”的主张。
    西方通讯社的消息说，会议在对苏联政策的估计、和平共处的真正基础以及社会主义阵营以外的国家所应当遵循的政策等问题上意见并不一致，但是大家都认为战争危险已经减少。大多数总理承认苏联不要世界大战。
    印度总理尼赫鲁强调战争“不是不可避免的”，并且要求同苏联真诚合作。他指出，印度的经验证明同苏联保持正常关系是可能的。
    伦敦“工人日报”从保守党人士方面得到的消息说，尼赫鲁还要求接纳中国加入联合国，并且要求采取行动使世界更加和平。他建议停止氢弹试验，集中力量来使原子能用于工业的目的。
    英国工党的“每日先驱报”说，尼赫鲁还认为，“应当果断地重新考虑英联邦国家对目前的（军事）联盟的态度”。他这个主张得到锡兰总理班达拉奈克的支持。
    据西方通讯社说，加拿大总理圣劳伦认为不应当自然而然地从冷战的角度来看待俄国的一切行动。但是他又说，西方不应当完全改变它的政策。
    法新社说，艾登的意见“似乎介于”尼赫鲁和圣劳伦之间。
    英联邦人士说，大多数总理认为，今后社会主义阵营和非社会主义阵营的斗争将是经济方面的斗争。有些总理认为，如果西方要在这个斗争中取得胜利，就必须增加对工业落后国家的“援助”的速度和数量。
    六月二十八日下午，英联邦总理分头进行了会外交谈。据西方通讯社报道，尼赫鲁同艾登就对苏联的看法、中东问题和印度支那问题交换了意见。这是尼赫鲁这次到伦敦后第二次同艾登会谈。澳大利亚总理孟席斯也同艾登商谈了贸易问题。
