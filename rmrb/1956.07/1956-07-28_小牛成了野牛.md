    Calf Turns Wild
    When we went to Teng County to inspect the work, we learned that the issue of cattle breeding was very serious. There are now 54 calves by the side of Weishan Lake that no one wants, and they are running around everywhere like wild cattle. The agricultural cooperatives can't afford to raise the cattle. For example, the Qianjin Cooperative in Liuquan Township, Jiehe District of the county, has 60 head of cattle and more than 800 mu of cultivated land. If we calculate that each cow needs to cultivate at least 30 mu of land, only 26 head are needed. The remaining 34 head have to be raised for nothing. Each cow needs more than ten jin of grass per day, which costs more than three jiao, more than a person's living expenses. This year, there has been a lot of rain in Shandong, and the wheat straw is damp and moldy, so the cattle won't eat it. The mountains are closed for afforestation, and the lake is closed for aquaculture, so there is nowhere to graze the cattle. No one wants to buy them. The county supply and marketing cooperative has purchased 5,862 head, and has to spend more than 1,700 yuan on feed every day. But buying feed is also a problem. When I inspected the work in Weixian County this spring, I also found that calves were being sold for five jiao a head, but no one wanted them. At present, the conditions for slaughtering are strictly controlled. What should we do? I suggest that the relevant departments make unified plans and quickly help solve the problem.

    小牛成了野牛
    我们到滕县检查工作，了解到关于牛的饲养的问题很是严重，微山湖边现在有54条小牛无人要，到处乱跑成了野牛。农业社养牛又养不起，如该县界河区柳泉乡前进社有牛六十头，耕地八百多亩，如按每头牛最低耕三十亩田计算只须二十六头，其余的三十四头，就得白养，每头牛每日须十斤多草，就需要三角多钱，比一个人的生活费还高。今年山东多雨，麦秸水湿发霉牛还不吃，山上封山造林，湖上封湖养水产，放牛无处放，卖给谁谁都不要。县供销合作社收购了5，862头，每天就得开支饲草钱一千七百多元。但买饲料也成问题，今春到潍县检查工作也发现小牛五角一头还没人要。目前宰杀的条件掌握又严。怎么办呢？我建议有关部门统一规划，迅速帮助解决。
