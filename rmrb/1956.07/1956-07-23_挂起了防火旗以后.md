After the Fire Prevention Flag Was Hung Up
Gu Yu

May in Luobei is the time of year when the spring drought is at its worst and the grass is dry. One day, a strong wind began to blow. The wind grew stronger and stronger, lifting the roofs of the grass houses, shaking the trees in the mountains and forests, its roar like the Yellow River bursting its banks.

Qin Wenying, a member of the forest fire prevention committee, immediately set up sentry posts at the village entrance and on the watchtower, assigning people to shifts; then she hung up a fire prevention flag.

When the flag is raised, everyone in the village understands that this means a wind of level five or higher; according to the public agreement, no one can cook with fire under these circumstances.

She assigned the work and went around the village to check for any signs of smoke. She started from the east end of the village, walking around each house towards the west end. Just as she reached the middle of the village, she immediately smelled smoke. "Strange, where is this smoke coming from?" Thinking of the families to the south, she followed the smell. After searching around, she discovered the smoke was rising from the chimney of Grandma Li Gui's house. Qin Wenying thought about finding Guo Dajuan, the group leader of Li Gui's public agreement implementation team, and asking her to take a look. She had only taken a few steps when Guo Dajuan came walking towards her in a fluster.

From a distance, Guo Dajuan said, "Hurry over there, Grandma Li is burning a fire to steam buns. I said a few words as the group leader, but it didn't have any effect at all."

Qin Wenying said, "No effect? The group leader was elected by everyone, and she herself participated in making the public agreement; didn't you ask her, what good is it to make the agreement if it isn't implemented?"

"I asked, and she said: 'Who knew that this would coincide with the day my relatives are visiting; if I had known, I wouldn't have agreed to this rule.' I told her she wouldn't listen, and I got so angry that I said: 'If you keep burning the fire, I'll scoop water and put it out!' Grandma Li said: 'If you put out the fire, you might as well put out my old life too!' I'm at a loss, she won't listen to reason. You go and take a look."

"Okay, I'll go. You keep an eye on her chimney, don't let any sparks fly out."

Qin Wenying walked towards Grandma Li's house. On the way, she thought: Grandma Li has a straightforward temper, she says whatever is on her mind. She remembered that after the fire last year, Grandma Li had said: "If anyone starts a fire on a windy day in the future, I'll drag them through the streets!" Now, only a year has passed, and she has already forgotten the suffering of fighting the fire.

Grandma Li was kneading dough on a board, and when she saw Qin Wenying coming in, she thought, "Dajuan must have reported it. Humph, let whoever comes come, the buns must be steamed; just make sure a fire doesn't start." Qin Wenying walked into the house and saw the water in the pot boiling and the fire in the stove burning brightly. Looking at Grandma Li's face, it was long and drawn, as if she were ready for an argument.

When Grandma Li saw Wenying sitting across from her, she felt it wouldn't be right not to greet her, so she said, "Little girl, what brings you to sit with this old woman for a while?"

Qin Wenying smiled and said, "I'm here to help you steam buns, Grandma."

"Humph, how considerate."

"Oh, Grandma, what kind of child did Sister Yuhua have?"

"A big, fat boy, I heard he's fair and chubby." When she mentioned her daughter and grandson, a smile appeared on her face.

"Is it the third day today?"

"Of course. Why else would I be so busy with this? The dough was proofed yesterday, if I don't steam it during the day it will turn sour at night, wouldn't that be wasting grain? Besides, there's a custom, if the mother's family doesn't visit on the third day, they have to wait until the full month. Do you think a mother can wait a whole month?"

Qin Wenying understood her meaning and said:

"Grandma, wasn't Sister Yuhua supposed to have the baby last June? What happened?"

"Ah, silly girl, this isn't that one. That one was a miscarriage a long time ago. It was also a fat little boy."

"She was so busy working in the fields that she didn't take care of herself."

"It wasn't in the fields, it was from fighting the fire. Didn't you and I go to that big fire last year? We were on the fire ground for five days and five nights straight, so tired that we couldn't even lift our arms. After being tired, we just felt hungry, and our vision went dark in waves, just hoping for the plane to drop dry food. Later the plane came and dropped a lot of biscuits, but we just couldn't eat the biscuits, and we were always thirsty."

"Sister Yuhua also went with her big belly?"

"She went, how could she miss that. The Party branch secretary didn't want her to go, but she insisted. Because she's also a member of the forest fire prevention committee, and as soon as she sees a fire, she gets red-eyed. It was that time, the day after returning from the fire ground, alas,.... She lost the baby, and almost lost her life too."

"One person starting a fire causes suffering for thousands."

"That's right. That's why I got so angry and said: If I catch the person who started the fire, I'll hand them over to the government to be severely punished. What a huge crime they've committed!"

"Grandma, you don't know. Just fighting fires last year, our government spent more than six hundred thousand yuan, enough to buy thirty or forty tractors. If we had that many tractors, this large area of wasteland here would have been cultivated long ago. Besides, so many trees were burned, it takes so many years to grow that tall! Now the country is using wood for construction..."

Grandma Li listened in stunned silence. The firewood in the stove was already burning out. Qin Wenying pointed at it and said to Grandma Li: "Grandma, we've been talking and we haven't noticed, the fire is burning outside the stove, quickly fill it in."

Grandma Li stood up unhurriedly, scooped a basin of water from the water tank, and poured it into the stove. There was a "sizzle" sound, and billowing smoke and vapor billowed out from inside. At this time, Grandma Li became worried, she said anxiously: "I forgot, I forgot, when water hits the fire, sparks will come out of the chimney!" She hurried out and looked at the roof.

On the roof, Guo Dajuan, who was sitting next to the chimney, said to Grandma Li, who was looking up: "It's okay, Grandma, I've already covered the chimney opening."

"I was wondering why it was so smoky inside. You young women are so hard to deal with." Saying that, she poured the rest of the water on, and the fire was completely extinguished.

Qin Wenying said to Grandma Li, "Grandma, when it gets dark and the wind dies down, I'll come and help you steam them."

"Steaming them at night will delay the visit to relatives."

"Then what should we do?"

"What to do? Just take these kneaded raw buns. When the wind stops, I'll steam them at her house. When I get there, I'll say: 'There's a wind today, and we can't start a fire. Otherwise, if a fire starts, the country will suffer a great loss.' She's also a member of the fire prevention committee, she can't fault her mother."

    挂起了防火旗以后
    谷峪
    五月的萝北，正是春旱草干的时候，有一天刮起了大风。那风愈刮愈有劲，它掀动着草房的顶子，摇幌着山林的树木，怒吼声如同黄河决口了。
    护林防火委员秦文英马上把村口和了望台上设下岗哨，派好换班的人；然后把一面防火旗挂起来。
    旗子升起，全村的人全都懂得，这是五级以上的大风；按照公约，在这种情况下就不能烧火做饭了。
    她把工作布置下去，自己在村子里转着，检查有没有冒烟的地方。她从村东头开始，绕着各家的房屋向村西头走来。刚走到村当中的时候，立刻嗅到了一股烟味。“南风，这烟味是从谁家来的呢？”她想着南面的人家，一面顺着烟味寻找。找来找去发现炊烟是在李贵大娘家的烟囱里升起的。秦文英看了，打算去找李贵大娘的公约执行小组长郭大娟。让她去看看。她刚走了几步，郭大娟却迎面慌慌张张地走来。
    离很远，郭大娟就说：“你快去吧，李大娘烧火蒸馍馍哩。我这组长去说了几句，一点作用也不起。”
    秦文英说：“不起作用？组长是大家选的，公约是她自己也参加订的；你没有问问她，光订出来，不执行还顶啥用？
      “我问啦，人家说：‘谁承想正赶上走亲的这一天刮风啊；要知道，可不订这一条。’我说她不听，后来气得我说：‘你再烧火，我就舀水泼啦！’李大娘说：‘你泼火，也连我这老命泼煞吧！’我算没了办法，软硬都不吃。你快去看看吧。”
    “好，我去。你看着点她家的烟囱，别让跑出火来。”
    秦文英向李大娘家走来。一路上想：李大娘是个直性脾气，心里有什么就说什么。她想起去年打火以后，李大娘说过：“以后风天谁弄火，非牵着他游街不可。”如今刚过了一年，自己倒把打火的苦头忘啦。
    李大娘正在板上揉馍馍，看见秦文英进来，心里说：“这是大娟报告的。哼，谁来就谁来，反正馍馍一定要蒸；保证失不了火就行。”秦文英走进屋，见锅里的水滚着，灶火里的火烧的很旺。再看李大娘那脸，拉成长长的一条了，像蹩着吵架的样子。
    李大娘见文英坐在对面，觉得再不打招呼就不对了，就说：“大丫头，怎么有空凑大娘坐一会啦？”
    秦文英笑了笑说：“我是帮大娘蒸馍馍来啦。”
    “哼，真孝顺。”
    “哎，大娘，玉花姐姐添了个什么孩子呀？”
      “大胖小子呗，听说又白又胖。”当她提起闺女和外甥的时候，脸上才露出笑模样。
      “今天三天吗？”
    “可不是呢。要不我为什么忙着弄这个。面是昨天发上的，白天不蒸晚上就酸，那不又是浪费粮食吗？再说，还有个俗礼，三天娘家人不去，就得到满月去看。你说，当娘的能等得一个月吗？”
    秦文英懂得了她的意思，就说：
  “大娘，玉花姐姐不是该去年六月生孩子吗？怎么到了现在？”
      “唉，傻闺女，这哪里还是那个。那个早就小产了。也是个胖小子。”
      “光顾下地劳动，就不知道爱惜自己的身子。”
      “那里，不是下地，是打火打的。去年着大火，不是你也去了，我也去了吗？一连五天五夜在火场上，累得人抬胳膊的劲都没有喽。累了以后光觉饿，一阵一阵的眼黑，光盼飞机来扔干粮。后来飞机也来啦，饼干也扔下不少，可就看着饼干吃不下去，又光发渴了。”
    “玉花姐姐带着大身子也去啦？”
      “去啦，这事还能少了她。支部书记不让她去，可是她非去不可。因为她也是护林防火委员，一见着了火，你想红不红眼。就是那一次，从火场回来的第二天，唉，……。糟塌了孩子，还差一点把命搭上。”
      “这是一人弄火，万人遭殃呀。”
      “对。要不气得我说：逮住那个弄火的，非交政府重重地办他不可。他造下多大罪！”
      “大娘，你还不知道。光去年打火，咱们政府就花了六十多万块钱，要买拖拉机，能买三、四十架呀。要有那么多拖拉机，咱这里这一大片荒地也早就开出来了。再说烧那么多树，得多少年长那么高呀！现在国家建设正用木头……”
    李大娘听得目瞪口呆，灶火里的木柴已经着出来，秦文英指着向李大娘说：“大娘，咱光顾说话，火都着到外边来了，快往里填填。”
    李大娘不慌不忙地站起来，从水缸里舀一盆水，向灶火里一泼，只听“嚓”的一声，里边就冒出滚腾腾的烟和气团。这时李大娘怕起来了，她焦急地说：“忘啦，忘啦，这水一激，烟筒里要冒火星子哪！”她慌忙地跑出来向房上看。
    房上，坐在烟筒旁边的郭大娟，向正在张望的李大娘说：“不要紧，大娘，烟筒口我早已经盖上啦。”
      “我说怎么屋里这么烟哩。这些小媳妇子，没有见过像你们这样难惹的。”说着她又把半盆水泼上去，火全熄灭了。
    秦文英向大娘说：“大娘，到天黑，风小了我来帮你蒸。”
      “晚上蒸，就耽误了走亲。”
      “那可怎么办呢？”
      “怎么办，就拿这揉出的生馍馍去。等煞了风在她家蒸吧。去了我就说：‘今天刮风啦，不能烧火。不的话，失了火，国家得被多大伤啊，’她也是防火委员，不能挑娘这个错。……”
