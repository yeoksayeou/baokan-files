    Let Technical Personnel Do Technical Work
    To the Editor:
    I studied mechanical manufacturing and have been working in a mining machinery manufacturing plant since graduating from university. At the end of last year, I was transferred to the China National Machinery Import Corporation under the Ministry of Foreign Trade. In the past few months, I have found that the China National Machinery Import Corporation has a serious problem of stockpiling and wasting technical personnel. The Machine Tool Department of this company has one engineer and seven technicians out of twenty-eight people; the Electrical Engineering Department has four engineers and four technicians out of thirty-two people; and there are also many technical personnel in the Mining and Metallurgy Department and other units. The main work of these technical personnel is to receive and send letters and telegrams, make plans, compile statistical reports, convert currencies, proofread contracts, pay bills, and so on. The remaining part of the technical personnel have very little work to do and are known as "full-time cadres."
    Many technical personnel are dissatisfied with this situation, especially after studying Premier Zhou's "Report on the Question of Intellectuals." Everyone has been constantly raising opinions to the leadership. However, a responsible comrade of the company said at a general staff meeting: "Technical personnel transferred from industrial departments will definitely not be at ease at first; but over time, they will naturally be at ease." Because the leaders have this view, they adopt a "dragging" attitude towards the opinions raised by technical personnel and are unwilling to solve the problem at all.
    Of course, the Machinery Import Corporation also needs some technical personnel, but it is completely unnecessary to equip so many technical personnel. Because the order cards here are completely put forward by the various industrial departments, and the models and specifications of the various machines to be ordered have already been clearly filled in the cards. When ordering from abroad, if the supplying country cannot supply the models of machines listed on the card, and suggests replacing them with another model, the company cannot make its own decision and must seek the consent of the department that originally placed the order. The company needs to mainly do liaison work. The existing commodity clerks are competent enough to do this liaison work, and it does not need to be done by technical personnel. Moreover, there is not much of this liaison work.
    National construction requires a large number of technical talents. The China National Machinery Import Corporation should not keep so many technical personnel for non-technical work for a long time! I request the Ministry of Foreign Trade to pay attention to this issue and transfer the technical personnel accumulated in this company to places where they are really needed as soon as possible.

### 让技术人员去做技术工作

    让技术人员去做技术工作
    编辑同志：
    我是学机械制造的，大学毕业后一直在一个矿山机械制造厂工作。去年年底，我被调到对外贸易部所属中国机械进口公司。几个月来，我发现中国机械进口公司积压和浪费技术力量的现象很严重。这个公司的机床处二十八个人中有工程师一人、技术员七人；电工处三十二人中有工程师四人、技术员四人；矿冶处等单位的技术人员也很多。这些技术人员的主要工作就是收发函电、做计划、统计表报、货币换算、校对合同、承付账单等等；其余一部分技术人员因为工作很少，被人称为“脱产干部”。
    对这种状况，很多技术人员是不满意的，特别是学习了周总理“关于知识分子问题的报告”以后，大家就不断向领导方面提出意见。但是，公司的一位负责同志在全体职工大会上说：“从工业部门调来的技术人员，开始一定不会安心的；但是时间长了，就自然安心了。”由于领导人有这种看法，他们对技术人员提出的意见就一概采取“拖”的态度，根本不愿意解决问题。
    当然，机械进口公司也需要一些技术人员，但是配备那么多的技术人员是完全没有必要的。因为，这里的订货卡片完全是由各工业部门提出来的，需要订购的各种机器的型号、规格都已经在卡片内填写清楚了。在向国外订购的时候，如果供应国对卡片内所列型号的机器不能供应，建议以另一种型号代替，公司也不可以自行决定，必须征求原来提出订货的部门的同意。公司需要做的主要是联系工作。这些联系工作，现有的商品员都能胜任，不必由技术人员来做。何况就是这种联系工作也并不多。
    国家建设需要大量技术人才，中国机械进口公司不应该把这么多的技术人员长期留着作非技术性的工作！我要求对外贸易部重视这个问题，及早地把积压在这个公司里的技术人员输送到真正需要的地方去。
