Xinhua News Agency, Lüda, 20th - The renovation and expansion project of the Dalian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Manufacturing Plant has recently begun construction. The entire renovation and expansion project will be completed within two years. At that time, this factory will be transformed from a comprehensive locomotive and rolling stock manufacturing operation into a specialized locomotive manufacturing plant, and the locomotive manufacturing technology will reach an advanced level. The annual output of locomotives will be three times higher than this year. The total investment in the entire project will be recovered within two years after these projects are completed and put into production.

　　In the locomotive machinery workshop, where installation work is proceeding intensely, the original equipment was almost all installed more than fifty years ago. Its precision is very poor and it cannot produce products that require high precision. The process layout is also unreasonable, with many and lengthy production transfer processes, so that production potential cannot be fully utilized. In order to change this backward situation, the planned new equipment accounts for 50% of the original equipment; the old equipment will also be reinstalled and arranged in accordance with the new process regulations.

　　The two foundry workshops that are being prepared for renovation will be transformed into fully mechanized molding workshops. Currently, these two workshops manufacture various castings entirely by hand. After the renovation, from molding to finished products, everything will be fully mechanized. All material transportation and component transfer will also be changed to conveyor belt transportation.

    产量提高三倍、投资两年收回  
    大连机车车辆制造工厂进行改建扩建
    新华社旅大20日电　大连机车车辆制造工厂的改建和扩建工程，最近开始施工。全部改建和扩建工程将在两年内完成。那时，这个工厂将由目前的机车车辆制造的综合性生产，改造成机车制造的专业工厂，并且要使制造机车的技术达到先进水平；机车的年产量，将比今年提高三倍。全部工程的投资额，将在这些工程建好投入生产以后的两年内收回。
    在紧张进行安装工程的机车机械车间里，原有的各种设备几乎都是五十年以前安装的，精密度很差，不能生产精密度要求很高的产品；工艺布置也不合理，生产转移过程多、时间长，以致生产潜力不能很好发挥出来。为了改变这种落后情况，计划增加的新设备，相当原有设备的50％；旧有的设备，也将按照新的工艺规程重新进行安装排列。
    正在准备开工改建的两个铸造车间，将被改变成全盘机械化造型的车间。现在，这两个车间制造各种铸件，都是运用手工进行。它们经过改建以后，从造型直到出品，将完全机械化；所有材料运输和部件的转移，也将改用运输带传送。
