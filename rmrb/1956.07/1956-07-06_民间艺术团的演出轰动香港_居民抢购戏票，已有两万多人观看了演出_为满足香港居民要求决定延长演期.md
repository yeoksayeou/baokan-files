Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, July 5th: As of the 4th, the Chinese Folk Art Troupe has performed for fourteen days and sixteen shows in Hong Kong, and over 20,000 audience members have enjoyed the excellent Chinese folk art to their satisfaction.

In recent days, Hong Kong residents' rush to buy tickets for the art troupe's performances has been even more enthusiastic than a week ago. On the evening of the 3rd, after 10 PM, before the theater had even emptied, people were already waiting in front of the theater, waiting to buy tickets for the next three days, which would go on sale starting on the 4th. Many suburban workers, after getting off work on the evening of the 3rd, rushed from far away to the city to buy tickets, some carrying straw mats and food, sleeping rough in front of the theater, some even playing chess and cards all night long. When, after waiting for more than ten hours, they finally bought that precious ticket, their faces were filled with happy smiles.

Hong Kong art figures who have seen the art troupe's performances in the past week have all expressed great satisfaction. Chen Jintang, a famous Cantonese opera actor and vice chairman of the Hong Kong Cantonese Opera Bahe Guild, said: Only today's China can organize folk art and present it to the world. Every program performed by the art troupe can bring glory to the country. This veteran Cantonese opera performer, known as "Martial Arts Champion," especially admired the performances of the Peking Opera "Wu Song Fights the Inn" and the "Lion Dance." Hong Kong film director Tu Guangqi said: "I believe that no matter who they are, no matter what their profession or belief, they will all praise the successful performance of the art troupe." Chen Dou, a famous Hong Kong martial arts master, especially praised the wonderful performance of the "Lion Dance."

On the evenings of the 3rd and 4th, Hong Kong Radio, following "Rediffusion," broadcast recordings of the entire program performed by the Chinese Folk Art Troupe on the evening of June 28th. The fronts of many herbal tea shops and food shops in Hong Kong were filled with people listening attentively to the wonderful performances of the Chinese Folk Art Troupe.

Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, July 5th: The Chinese Folk Art Troupe has accepted the request of Hong Kong compatriots and decided to extend its performance run in Hong Kong.

As of the 4th, the Chinese Folk Art Troupe has already performed in Hong Kong for two weeks according to the original plan. Because every show was sold out and it was very difficult to buy tickets, many Hong Kong residents who had not seen the art troupe's performances wrote letters requesting the art troupe to extend its performance time in Hong Kong. The Hong Kong Chinese General Chamber of Commerce's Joint Cultural Circles Reception Committee for the Chinese Folk Art Troupe's visit to Hong Kong, in order to meet the demands of Hong Kong residents, telegraphed and wrote to the South China Federation of Literary and Art Circles in Guangzhou, requesting their agreement to extend the art troupe's performances in Hong Kong. Recently, the reception committee has received a reply agreeing to extend the art troupe's run in Hong Kong by ten days to two weeks.

    民间艺术团的演出轰动香港
    居民抢购戏票，已有两万多人观看了演出
    为满足香港居民要求决定延长演期
    新华社香港5日电　到四日止，中国民间艺术团已经在香港上演了十四天十六场，观众两万多人满意地欣赏了优秀的中国民间艺术。
    连日来，香港居民抢购艺术团戏票的情况，比一周前还要热烈。三日晚上十时多，戏院还未散场，就有人在戏院门前守候，等着买四日开始预售的以后三天的戏票。许多郊区的工人在三日晚上下班后，就从很远的地方赶到市区买票，其中有的带着草席、食物在戏院门前露宿，有的还带了象棋、扑克牌玩个通宵。当轮候了十多个钟头而终于买到那张珍贵的戏票时，他们的面上都堆满着愉快的笑容。
    在最近一周内看过艺术团演出的香港艺术界人士，都表示非常满意。著名的粤剧演员、香港粤剧八和会馆副主席陈锦棠说：只有现在的中国，才能把民间艺术整理出来，公开于世界。艺术团演出的每一个节目，都是能够替国家增光的。这位被称为“武状元”的粤剧老前辈，特别对京剧“武松打店”和“狮子舞”的演出表示钦佩。香港电影导演屠光启说：“我相信，不管什么人，不管他是什么职业和信仰，对艺术团的成功演出都是赞美的”。香港著名的国术界拳师陈斗特别推崇“狮子舞”的精彩表演。
    三日和四日晚上，香港广播电台继“丽的呼声”电台之后，播放了中国民间艺术团六月二十八日晚上演出的全部节目的录音。香港的许多凉茶店和食物店门前，都站满了聚精会神地倾听中国民间艺术团精彩演唱的人。
    新华社香港5日电　中国民间艺术团接受香港同胞的请求，决定延长在香港的演期。
    到四日为止，中国民间艺术团已经按照原定计划在香港演出了两个星期。由于场场满座，购票十分困难，许多没有看到艺术团表演的香港居民，纷纷写信要求艺术团延长在香港演出的时间。香港中华总商会联合文化界接待中国民间艺术团莅港演出委员会为了满足香港居民的要求，曾经打电报并写信到广州华南文学艺术界联合会，要求同意延长艺术团在香港的演出。最近，接待委员会已经接到答复，同意艺术团在香港的演期延长十天到两周。这是香港市民在璇宫戏院前排队购票的情景。（新华社稿）
