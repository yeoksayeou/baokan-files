Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, July 20th. Recently, Fujian Province has been experiencing drought and water shortage. Large numbers of officers and soldiers from the Chinese People's Liberation Army stationed in the Fujian area have been helping farmers in the fields to combat and prevent drought every day.

    Troops stationed in the Fuzhou urban area recently worked with farmers in the suburbs to dig a 28-li-long irrigation canal, irrigating 5,000 mu of farmland. Under the slogan "Drawing Min River water with sweat," the officers and soldiers participating in the labor launched a labor competition in the scorching heat of over 90 degrees Fahrenheit. Some troops, with the spirit of "rescue is like putting out a fire," worked continuously in shifts for five days and nights. The construction site was like a bustling market day and night. At night, thousands of people swung their picks and shovels under gasoline lamps, and many officers and soldiers voluntarily worked overtime in the scorching sun. The troops responsible for digging the Tongpan Mountain canal also created an advanced working method of "focusing on breakthroughs and large-scale soil excavation." Many officers who were on leave also volunteered to go to the construction site to participate in labor.

    In the southern Fujian area, large numbers of officers and soldiers help farmers with waterwheels, manual water pumps, digging wells, and repairing canals every day. Troops stationed in mountainous areas also frequently help farmers carry water to irrigate terraced fields.

    When the drought began to occur, the leading organs of the Chinese People's Liberation Army on the Fujian Front issued a notice to help farmers combat and prevent drought, requiring all officers and soldiers to actively support farmers in completing this year's grain production increase task, actively publicize the principles of overcoming disasters to farmers, and encourage their confidence in striving for a bumper harvest in the autumn. The notice said: This is a concrete action of our army directly participating in the socialist construction of the motherland.

    解放军官兵帮助福建农民抗旱
    新华社福州20日电　福建省近来天旱缺雨，驻福建地区的中国人民解放军部队，每天都有大批的军官和士兵在田野里帮助农民抗旱、防旱。
    驻福州市区的部队，最近和郊区农民一起挖通了一条二十八里长的引水渠道，五千亩田得到灌溉。参加劳动的军官和士兵在“用汗水引来闽江水”的口号下，在华氏九十多度的酷暑中展开了劳动竞赛。有的部队以“救急如救火”的精神，分班连续工作了五昼夜。工地上日夜像闹市，夜间上千的人在汽油灯底下挥动镐锹，烈日当空的时候许多官兵自动加班加点。担负挖掘铜盘山渠道的部队，还创造了“重点突破大块刨土”的先进工作法。许多正在休假的军官也自动赶到工地参加劳动。
    在闽南地区，每天都有大批官兵帮助农民车水、戽水、打井、修补渠道。驻山区的部队还经常帮助农民担水浇梯田。
    在旱象开始发生的时候，福建前线中国人民解放军领导机关就发出帮助农民抗旱、防旱的通知，要求全体官兵积极支援农民完成今年粮食增产任务，积极向农民宣传战胜灾害的道理，鼓舞他们争取秋季丰收的信心。通知上说：这是我军直接参加祖国社会主义建设的具体行动。
