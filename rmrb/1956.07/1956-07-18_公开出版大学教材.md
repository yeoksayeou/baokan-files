Reader's Opinion:

    Publicly Publish University Textbooks
    We need to buy several sets of textbooks used by university students for self-study, but we are very disappointed. In recent years, most of the textbooks used by universities are self-compiled and for internal use only, not for external distribution. We hope that relevant departments will study this issue so that university textbooks can be publicly published to meet the needs of the vast number of self-learners.

    公开出版大学教材
    我们需要买几套大学生所用的教科书自修，可是很失望，最近几年间各大学的教科书大多是自编自用而不外传的。希望有关部门研究这个问题，使各大学的教材都公开出版，供应广大自学者的需要。
