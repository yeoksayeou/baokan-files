Older Beijing residents will surely remember the "Wan Sheng Yuan" outside Xizhimen. If you compare it with the current Beijing Zoo, it is not difficult to see the tremendous changes that have taken place. As China's first zoo, it has a history of half a century (Wan Sheng Yuan was founded in 1906). However, only after liberation did it gradually recover and be reorganized, entering a stage of rapid development and gradually becoming a modern science popularization institution.

Now, with the help of guides, signs, and a series of publications and publicity efforts, the zoo enables several million visitors each year to gain vivid knowledge of animal science. The zoo also pays special attention to the introduction of China's precious animals, the relationship between wild animals and humans, and the embodiment of Darwin and Michurin's theories.

In addition to popularization, the zoo also has the task of raising scientific standards. The zoo also plans several scientific research topics, which it intends to carry out year by year. In promoting the development of biological sciences, the zoo maintains certain connections with the Academy of Sciences, Peking University, Beijing Agricultural University, and other institutions, with each having its own division of labor and cooperating with each other. During the summer, not only do biology students and teachers from Beijing come to the zoo for production practice every year, but also institutions of higher learning from as far away as Shanghai, Nanjing, Wuhan, Nanchang, and other places often come to practice here.

Currently, the zoo has more than 200 species and more than 1,300 animals, many of which can be called "rare species." For example, the four giant pandas are the most precious animals in the world, and any large zoo in a foreign country would be willing to exchange them for any animal. Another example is the world-famous Père David's deer (commonly known as "sibuxiang" or "four unlike"), which, after more than half a century of separation, has had two pairs brought back from overseas this spring, rejoining the ranks of China's special native animals. There are also the golden snub-nosed monkeys, a specialty of the high mountains of Southwest China, the golden takin, a specialty of the Qinling Mountains, and the white-headed langur, a specialty of the Guangxi border, all of which are "exclusive" and have never been exhibited by any major zoo in the world. As for the Northeast tiger, South China tiger, snow leopard, clouded leopard, leopard cat, red panda, and Asiatic black bear, several relatively precious products of China, they are also considered quite rare internationally.

Among the animals from abroad, the most popular with visitors are elephants and giraffes. Other animals such as lions, polar bears, brown bears, and zebras, although not particularly rare animals, are also very popular.

In order to enrich the content and enrich the people's knowledge, several collection teams are dispatched to the inland border areas all year round to obtain more animals. Guangdong and Guangxi, and the Northeast are frequent destinations. In addition, there are those who go to the Yunnan border to explore traces of elephants, those who go deep into the Junggar Basin to capture wild horses, and those who are stationed in western Sichuan to continue collecting giant pandas. As for friendly international exchanges, we have exchanged for many species that cannot be obtained domestically in the past, and there will certainly be more in the future.

To exhibit animals well, architecture and environment are also very important. Almost nothing remains of the old buildings left over from the "Wan Sheng Yuan" except for a monkey mountain. Among the new buildings, the larger ones include Polar Bear Mountain, Black Bear Mountain, Tiger Mountain, Elephant House, Antelope Pavilion, and Raptor Aviary, which are generally up to international standards. The Panda House, Giraffe House, Hippopotamus Hall, and Père David's Deer Garden are under construction and will be completed one after another this year. In order to exhibit more species, large-scale buildings such as the Ape and Monkey Hall, Bird Hall, Aquarium, Reptile Hall, Alpine Animal Garden, and Aquatic Animal Pool are also being planned. By the end of the Second Five-Year Plan, when various animal houses, science buildings, cultural centers, and other buildings have been completed one after another, the Beijing Zoo will have the potential to reach advanced international levels. (Attached pictures) The monkeys have learned to salute. The leopard likes to scare people. The lion is always so dignified and majestic. The fierce and grumpy Northeast tiger. The elephant raises its trunk to warmly welcome visitors. If you didn't see it with your own eyes, you wouldn't believe that the puppy Merry is the lioness Libby's wet nurse. Beijing's summer is really hot, so the polar bear has to play in the water all day long. Zoo engineer Tan Bangjie (center) is measuring the skull of a polar bear with scientists to study its ecology. The animals living here can enjoy such rich and delicious food at every meal. "Heart and lungs are normal" - the medical staff is quite satisfied with the health of the fawn. Audiences will soon be able to see vivid scenes filmed by cinematographers on the screen. The weather is really nice! Let's go out and play. Let me play for a while too. Tastes good, but a little less. I'm full, I'll rest for a while. It's cool enough to sleep here. Hooo... One of the most popular animals with visitors - the giraffe. Inseparable black swans. "A crane standing among chickens" is indeed different. Golden Monkey, Raccoon Dog, Yak, Sable, Myna, Père David's Deer, Red-crowned Crane, Panda, Porcupine, Black Bear, Peacock, Sika Deer, Wolf.

    在北京动物园里

    上点年纪的北京人，总会记得西直门外的“万牲园”，如果同现在的北京动物园比较一下，也就不难发现今昔之间的巨大变化。作为中国的第一所动物园，它已有半个世纪的历史了（万牲园创建于1906年）。但是只有在解放以后，它才由逐步恢复整顿而进入到迅速发展的阶段，并逐渐成为一所现代化的科学普及机构。
    现在，这个动物园配合了解说员、说明牌以及一系列的出版宣传工作，每年有好几百万名观众可以从这里得到一些生动的、有关动物科学的知识，动物园还特别注重祖国珍贵动物的介绍，野生动物同人类的关系，达尔文和米丘林学说的体现等等。
    动物园在普及的基础上还有提高科学水平的任务。动物园也规划若干个科学研究题目，准备逐年进行。在推动生物科学的发展这项工作中，动物园和科学院、北京大学、北京农业大学等处保持着一定的联系，各有分工，互相配合。在暑期里，不但在北京的生物系师生每年到动物园进行生产实习，就是远在上海、南京、武汉、南昌等地的高等院校，也常有来实习的。
    目前动物园里有二百余种、一千三百余只动物，其中颇有不少堪称为“名贵品种”的。如四只大猫熊（俗名熊猫）便是世上最珍贵的动物，是外国任何大动物园愿以任何动物来交换的。又如举世闻名的麋鹿（俗名四不像），经过半个多世纪的阔别，今春已有两对由海外运来，重新归入祖国特产动物的行列。还有西南高山上特产的金丝猴，秦岭山区特产的金毛扭角羚和广西边境特产的白头叶猴也都是“独占品”，是国际间任何大动物园从未曾展览过的。至于东北虎、华南虎、雪豹、云豹、花金猫、小猫熊、马熊等几种祖国比较珍贵的产物，在国际间也算是相当稀罕的。
    由国外来的动物中，最受观众欢迎的是大象和长颈鹿。其他如狮子、白熊、棕熊、斑马等物，虽不算是特殊珍奇动物，可是也很受人注意。
    为了更充实内容，更丰富人民的知识，若干个搜集队常年派往内地边疆，以便获得更多的动物。两广和东北是常往之地，此外，有去云南边境探访象迹的，有深入准噶尔盆地去采捕野马的，也有坐镇川西以继续收集大猫熊的。至于国际间的友好交换，过去我们已换来许多国内得不到的种类，将来一定还会更多。
    动物要展览得好，建筑和环境也是很重要的。“万牲园”遗留下来的旧建筑物，除了一座猴山以外，几乎什么也不存在了。新建筑物中，规模较大的有白熊山、黑熊山、虎山、象房、羚羊馆、猛禽槛等，大致都赶得上国际间的水平。正在兴建中的有熊猫房、长颈鹿房、河马馆和麋鹿苑，今年内都可先后完成。而为了能展览更多的种类，如猿猴馆、鸟馆、水族馆、爬虫馆、高山动物苑和水兽池等等大型建筑物也都在规划之内。在第二个五年计划期末，当各种兽舍以及科学楼、文化馆等先后落成后，北京动物园完全有可能达到国际间的先进水平。（附图片）猴儿学会了敬礼金钱豹喜欢吓唬人狮子总是那么地庄重而又威严凶猛暴躁的  东北虎大象举起鼻子，热情地欢迎前来参观的人们。如果不是亲眼看到，谁也不会相信小狗梅利就是狮子里比的乳母。北京的夏天实在热，白熊只好整天在水中嬉戏。动物园工程师谭邦杰（中）正同科学工作者测量白熊的头骨，研究它的生态。生活在这里的动物，每餐都能享受到这样丰富而美味的食物。“心肺正常”，——医务人员对小鹿的健康颇为满意。观众们不久就可以从银幕上看到电影摄影师所拍摄的生动的镜头。天气真好！出去玩玩。让我也来玩一会儿。味道不错，可惜少了一点。吃饱了，休息一会儿。在这里睡一觉，够凉快的。呼……最受观众欢迎的动物之一——长颈鹿。形影不离的黑天鹅。“鹤立鸡群”，的确与众不同。金丝猴  狸  犛牛  黑貂  八哥  四不像  丹顶鹤  熊猫  箭猪  黑熊  孔雀  梅花鹿  狼
