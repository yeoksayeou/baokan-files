Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin Dispatch: Over 700 new designs and varieties of products such as printed cotton cloth, colored cloth, woolen fabric, and linen fabrics were exhibited at the Tianjin Municipal Textile Products Exhibition and Appraisal Meeting, which began on the 18th. These products were all trial-produced or produced by relevant factories in the first half of this year.

A printed cotton cloth with a plum-red background and black and white fluff flowers, and a printed cotton cloth with a light pink background and milky white patterns, stood out particularly brightly among the exhibits. A dark-colored cloth with large ginger flowers printed on straight twill woolen fabric looks indistinguishable from silk unless viewed from a yard away. "Pallis," woven from tussah silk and cotton yarn, is very stiff and does not crease easily. In the past, the Tianjin Woolen Mill could only produce jacquard blankets, but now, in response to consumer feedback, they have added printed blankets. A new type of scorched flower overcoating produced by the Renli Woolen Textile Factory is thick, light, and soft.

Along with these new products, 288 products with significant improvements in quality, design, and color were also exhibited. Among them, the "Good Harvest Year" brand scarlet cloth produced by the Tianjin Textile Dyeing Factory was rated as a national first-class product at the National Daily-Use Industrial Products Exhibition.

This product exhibition and appraisal meeting was jointly organized by the Tianjin Textile Administration Bureau, the Tianjin Municipal Textile Industry Bureau, the Tianjin Purchasing and Supply Station of the China National Textiles Import & Export Corporation, and the Tianjin Municipal Corporation of the China National Textiles Import & Export Corporation. The exhibition is scheduled to last for two weeks. During the exhibition, these four units will invite trade representatives from various regions and engineering and technical personnel from relevant factories in Tianjin to conduct quality appraisals of these products. The industrial departments will formulate new quality standards based on their opinions and submit them to relevant factories throughout the city for implementation.

    让人们打扮得更漂亮
    天津展览七百多种新纺织品
    新华社天津电　七百多种新花样和新品种的花布、色布、呢绒、麻绒等产品，十八日开始在天津市纺织产品展览鉴定会上展出。这些产品都是有关各工厂在今年上半年试制或生产出来的。
    一种梅红底印有黑白绒花的花布和一种浅粉红底印有乳白色花纹的花布，在展品中特别显得鲜艳夺目。一种在直贡呢上印有大朵洋荷花的深色布，如果站在一码以外看，就分辨不出它的质地是绸的还是布的。用柞蚕丝和棉纱织的“派力斯”很挺而且不容易起折。过去天津市毛织厂只能生产提花毛毯，现在根据消费者的意见增添了印花毛毯。仁立毛呢纺织厂新出产的一种烤花大衣呢，又厚又轻又软。
    和这些新产品同时展出的，还有二百八十八种质量、花样和颜色有显著改进的产品。其中天津市织染厂生产的“瑞兆丰年”牌大红布，在全国日用品工业展览会上被评选为全国第一流产品。
    这个产品展览鉴定会是由天津纺织管理局、天津市纺织工业局、中国纺织品公司天津采购供应站和中国纺织品公司天津市公司联合举办的。展期预定两周。在展览期间，这四个单位将邀请各地贸易代表和天津各有关工厂工程技术人员等对这些产品进行质量鉴定。工业部门将根据他们的意见制定新的质量标准，交全市各有关工厂执行。
