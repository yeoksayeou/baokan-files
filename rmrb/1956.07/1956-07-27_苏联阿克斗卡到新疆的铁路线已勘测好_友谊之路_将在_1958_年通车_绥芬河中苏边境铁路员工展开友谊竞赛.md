Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, July 26th: The people of Kazakhstan call the railway being built from Kazakhstan to Xinjiang the "Road of Friendship." According to the "Izvestia," this railway, which will run from the Aktogay station on the Turkestan-Siberia Railway in the Soviet Union to connect with Xinjiang and the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway in our country, will be open to traffic in the third year of the Sixth Five-Year Plan. The route within Kazakhstan has already been surveyed, passing south of Lake Sasykkol and Lake Alakol to the Dzungarian Gate.

This railway will cross the Tianshan Mountains, pass through a high point of 450 meters above sea level, descend from steep cliffs, and connect with the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway. The project is a large one. The section from Aktogay station to the future Dzungarian station is 308 kilometers long, passing through cliffs, rivers, and lakes. More than six million cubic meters of hard soil need to be excavated and filled in a short period of time, and one hundred buildings need to be built. The Turkestan-Siberia Railway Construction Bureau, which is responsible for this project, has already arranged many construction sections, transportation stations, and material yards.

Xinhua News Agency, July 26th: According to a TASS dispatch on the 25th: On the Sino-Soviet border, railway employees at the Chinese Suifenhe hub station and employees at the Soviet Far East Railway's Grodekovo hub station are successfully carrying out a competition.

A few days ago, a delegation of Chinese railway employees came to the Grodekovo hub station to check the results of the competition and exchange work experience with their Soviet counterparts. The Chinese guests visited the station operations at the Grodekovo hub station.

Railway employees at the Grodekovo hub station held a welcoming meeting for the Chinese guests. At this meeting, the Party Secretary of the Suifenhe hub station, representing the Chinese railway employees, expressed heartfelt thanks to the Soviet comrades for their friendly assistance in their work.

The Chinese railway employee representatives cited many examples to illustrate the good results of the competition between the railway employees of the two countries.

Chinese railway employees are prepared to learn in detail at the Grodekovo hub station about the train operation and freight handling methods adopted by the Soviet comrades, as well as the telecommunications situation.

    本报莫斯科26日电　哈萨克斯坦人民把将要建设的从哈萨克斯坦通达新疆的铁路叫做“友谊之路”。据“消息报”载，这条从苏联土西铁路的阿克斗卡车站铺到我国新疆和兰新铁路联接的铁路，将在第六个五年计划的第三年开始通车。在哈萨克斯坦境内的路线已经勘测好，那是经过沙塞库尔湖和阿拉库尔湖的南面到准噶尔口。
    这条铁路要穿过天山山脉，经过海拔四百五十公尺的高处，从峭崖陡壁下降，与兰新铁路衔接。这条铁路的工程很大，从阿克斗卡站到未来的准噶尔站有三百零八公里长，经过峭壁、山河和湖泊。在很短期间要挖掘和填补六百万立方公尺以上硬土，要建立一百个建筑物。负责这个工程的土西筑路局已经布置了许多建筑工段、运输站、材料场。
    新华社26日讯　据塔斯社二十五日讯：在中苏国境线上，中国绥芬河枢纽站的铁路员工和苏联远东铁路的格罗德科沃枢纽站的员工正在顺利地展开竞赛。
    前几天，中国铁路员工的代表团来到格罗德科沃枢纽站，同他们的苏联同行检查竞赛成果和交换工作经验。中国客人参观了格罗德科沃枢纽站的站务情况。
    格罗德科沃枢纽站的铁路员工为中国客人举行了欢迎大会。在这个大会上，绥芬河枢纽站的党委书记代表中国铁路员工，热烈感谢苏联同志在工作中给予的友好帮助。
