    The first baby born in the Luobei Youth Reclamation Area has already grown to be more than three months old. The baby's parents – Xin Yongzhen and Li Guizhen, members of the "May Fourth" Youth Collective Farm, have settled down on the wasteland with the help of their companions.
    Currently, most of the married couples among the 2,287 young people who have come to Luobei County to participate in reclamation work have settled down. Ten young couples from the 12th Farm have built small, single-roomed thatched huts next to the temporary sheds, and they have decorated their homes very neatly, with some hanging mirrors and photos on the walls of the huts. Some pregnant women live in thatched huts with heated kang beds, and the farm has prepared flour, eggs, and cloth for them. These pregnant women are now sewing small quilts and clothes in their spare time. Their work has been changed to lighter labor. Young couples who have not yet settled down are waiting to move into new houses after the end of July.
    In addition, more than 30 young men have found their loved ones during labor, and they have jointly pledged to work hard on the wasteland and settle down. When carrying out the farm's basic construction, the Farm Management Committee has taken into account the settlement of these happy young people, and has begun to build houses for them and the young people who will be bringing their families, all of which have kitchens, poultry sheds, and garden plots next to the houses.

    青年垦荒队员们安了家
    在萝北青年垦区诞生的第一个婴孩已经长大到三个多月了。婴孩的父母——“五四”青年集体农庄庄员辛永振和李桂珍，在同伴们的帮助下已经在荒地上安了家。
    目前来到萝北县参加垦荒工作的2，287名青年中的已婚夫妇大部分都安了家。十二号庄的十对青年夫妇，在临时草棚旁边盖了设有单间的小草棚，他们把家修饰的很整洁，有的在草棚的墙上挂上镜子和照片。一些怀孕的妇女住在设有火炕的草棚里，农庄还为她们准备了面粉、鸡蛋和布匹。现在这些孕妇正在工作余暇，缝制小被子和小衣服。她们的工作已调换作轻劳动。没有安家的青年夫妇，正在等着七月底以后搬进新房。
    另外有三十多名小伙子，在劳动中找到了爱人，他们共同保证在荒地上好好劳动，安家立业。农庄管理委员会在进行农庄基本建设时，已经考虑到这些幸福青年的安家问题，并且开始为他们和即将接来家属的青年筹建住宅，这些住宅都带有厨房、家禽舍和宅旁园地。
