Random Thoughts on Sketches in Hunan and Guangxi, No. 5
Chairman Mao's Former Residence
Hu Peihang

Originally, I intended to go to Mount Heng to visit Nanyue, but the locals said that Mount Heng can only be climbed when the weather is warm. The weather is not yet warm, the mountain winds are too strong, and the cold is too heavy to visit (at that time, Hunan was still burning charcoal braziers). So, I went to Changsha to climb Yuelu Mountain and sketched the Wangxiang Pavilion, Aiwanting Pavilion, and Six-Wheel Pagoda. Overlooking the Xiang River, the sails were like a forest, and small fishing boats came and went in the waves, sometimes appearing and sometimes disappearing, which was quite interesting. After descending the mountain, I took a car to Xiangtan and then to Shaoshan to visit the former residence of our most beloved Chairman Mao. This place is surrounded by mountains, deep, beautiful, and magnificent. There are no less than ten thousand pine and cypress trees on the mountains. Behind the former residence, layers of green bamboo make it feel even more refined and vibrant. The former residence is a typical Hunan-style wooden-framed house for farmers, with half of the roof covered with tiles and the other half with grass. In front of the house is a small courtyard, and in front of the courtyard are two small ponds. The one on the north side is where Chairman Mao swam in his childhood. Above the door of the house hangs a plaque with the words "Comrade Mao Zedong's Former Residence." Behind the house, there are also a grain-drying ground, a fish pond, and a loquat tree planted by Chairman Mao himself.

The comrade from the reception office told me in detail the story of Chairman Mao's childhood, which made me know that Chairman Mao strictly demanded himself from a young age, studied very diligently, and also loved labor very much. In addition to studying in the private school in the north neighborhood every day, he often participated in activities such as herding cattle and cutting grass.

Looking at Shaoshan from the reception building, it was raining, and white clouds were moving back and forth across the mountains, changing in thousands of ways, which was very helpful for studying the various methods of painting clouds used by the ancients. Ascending the building to view the mountains after the rain is one of Su Dongpo's sixteen delightful things, and I was able to see such a wonderful scene in the most beautiful hometown of Chairman Mao, which is truly a rare treat. I took the opportunity to paint six views of Shaoshan as a souvenir. (Attached image)

    湘桂写生随感之五
    毛主席的故居
    胡佩衡
    本来要到衡山去，参观南岳，据本地人说，衡山须天暖时可登，现在天气未暖，山风太大，寒气太重，不可往游（那时湖南尚燃炭盆）。遂到长沙登岳麓山，写了望湘亭、爱晚亭、六轮塔诸景。俯看湘江，帆影如林，小渔船往来在波涛中，忽隐忽现，也颇有趣。下山后，又乘汽车到湘潭转韶山，拜访我们最敬爱的毛主席的故居。此地四面环山，深秀壮丽，山上松柏，不下万株，故居的后面，绿竹层层，更觉得清华朗润。故居是湖南一般样式的农民居住的木架房，房上半边盖着瓦，半边盖着草。房前是小院场，场前有两个小池塘，在北边的就是毛主席幼年时代游泳过的地方。在房子的门口上，横悬一匾，上写“毛泽东同志故居”。房子的后边，还有晒谷坪、养鱼池和毛主席手栽的枇杷树。
    招待员同志详细地讲叙了毛主席少年时代的故事，使我知道毛主席在年幼时就严格的要求自己，非常用心学习，还非常热爱劳动，每天除在北邻的私塾中读书外，像放牛、割草等，是经常参加的。
    在招待所楼上看韶山，正值天雨，满山白云往来，千态万变，很可以研究古人画云的各种法子。雨后登楼看山，是东坡赏心十六事之一，我竟能在最秀丽的毛主席的家乡见到如此妙景，真是十二分的难得。我趁兴画了韶山六景，作为纪念。（附图片）
