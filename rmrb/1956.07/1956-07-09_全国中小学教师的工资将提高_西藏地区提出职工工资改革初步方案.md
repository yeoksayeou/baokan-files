Xinhua News Agency, 8th. National primary school teachers' average monthly salary will increase by 32.88% after the adjustment. Calculated on an annual average, the proportion of the increase in the average salary of primary school teachers will be about 10% higher than the proportion of the increase in the average salary of employees in enterprises, public institutions, and state organs.

In the past, the minimum wage standard for primary school teachers was 20.90 yuan, and in some areas, the salaries of primary school teachers were even lower than this standard. After this adjustment, the minimum wage standard for primary school teachers will be raised to 25 yuan (first wage standard, same below), which is higher than the minimum wage standard for cooperative salespersons, state-owned store clerks, and grain department warehouse keepers; the maximum wage standard for primary school teachers will be raised to 75 yuan, equivalent to the wage level between the fourth and fifth grades of middle school teachers.

In this adjustment, appropriate consideration was given to areas with originally lower wage levels, based on the different original wage levels, personnel composition, and price living standards in various regions. For example, the average monthly salary increase for primary school teachers in Hebei, Shanxi, Anhui, Henan, Hubei, Hunan, and Jiangxi provinces is all above 40%.

The maximum wage standard for middle school teachers after the adjustment will be the same as the highest level of lecturers in universities.

Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, 7th. The Tibet Region Wage Conference was held in Lhasa from June 22nd to July 6th. Based on the spirit of the National Wage Conference, the meeting discussed the preliminary wage reform plans proposed by various factories and mines in the Tibet region, made appropriate adjustments and modifications, appropriately increased the wages of the current main factory and mine workers in Tibet, and also increased the field work subsidies for year-round mobile surveying and mapping personnel.

When discussing the wage reform plan for the Tibet region, the meeting also fully considered the cultivation of Tibetan cadres and the needs of Tibet's development.

Fan Ming, Deputy Secretary of the Tibet Working Committee of the Communist Party of China, gave instructions on the wage reform issue in the Tibet region at the closing meeting.

    全国中小学教师的工资将提高
    西藏地区提出职工工资改革初步方案
    新华社8日讯　全国小学教师的月平均工资，调整后将比调整前提高32.88％。如以全年平均计算，小学教师的平均工资提高的比例比企业、事业机关和国家机关职工平均工资提高的比例，还要多提高10％左右。
    过去，小学教师的最低工资标准规定为二十元九角，有的地区小学教师的工资比这个标准还要低。这次调整后，小学教师的最低工资标准将提高到二十五元（第一种工资标准，下同），比合作社的营业员、国营商店的售货员、粮食部门的仓库保管员等的最低工资标准要高；小学教师的最高工资标准将提高到七十五元，相当于中学教师四、五级之间的工资水平。
    在这次调整中，根据各地原工资水平、人员组成和物价生活水平等不同情况，对于原来工资水平较低的地区，作了适当地照顾。如河北、山西、安徽、河南、湖北、湖南、江西等省小学教师月平均工资的增长都在40％以上。
    中学教师调整后的最高工资标准将和高等学校讲师的最高级相同。
    新华社拉萨7日电　西藏地区工资会议六月二十二日到七月六日在拉萨举行。会议根据全国工资会议的精神，讨论了西藏地区各工厂矿山企业提出的工资改革的初步方案，作了适当的平衡和修改，对目前西藏各主要工厂矿山职工的工资作了适当提高，对常年流动的踏勘、测量工作人员的野外工作津贴，也有了增加。
    会议在讨论西藏地区工资改革方案的时候，还充分照顾了藏族干部的培养和西藏发展的需要。
    中共西藏工委副书记范明在闭幕会上曾就西藏地区工资改革问题作了指示。
