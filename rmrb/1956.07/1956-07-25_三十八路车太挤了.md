    The No. 38 Bus is Too Crowded
    I have to go from outside Fuxingmen to Wangfujing for work every day. Every time I take the No. 38 bus, I feel distressed. Not only is the line always very long, but when a bus finally arrives, it’s either impossible to squeeze on, or the bus doesn't even stop at the station. Even if you manage to get on, there is often no room to stand, and you are squeezed so tightly by the surrounding crowd that you can't breathe, and even reaching into your pocket to get money to buy a ticket is difficult. If this continues, how can people bear it, especially in the hot weather? The passengers on the No. 38 bus are already complaining a lot. I hope the Beijing Public Transportation Company will consider the passengers and quickly find a way to improve the situation. (Xia Yun)

    三十八路车太挤了
    我每天要从复兴门外到王府井去办公。每次当我乘一段三十八路公共汽车的时候，总是感到苦恼。不仅是每次排队排得很长，并且好容易盼来了一辆汽车，不是挤不上去，就是车子到站不停。即使挤上了车，也往往是无立足之地，被周围的人群挤得透不过气来，甚至连伸手到袋里拿钱来买票都感到困难。这样下去，尤其是大热天人们怎能受得了？三十八路的乘客已经是议论纷纷了，希望北京市公共汽车公司为乘客着想，赶快设法改进。　（夏芸）
