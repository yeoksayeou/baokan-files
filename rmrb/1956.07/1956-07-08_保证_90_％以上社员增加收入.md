    Guaranteeing Increased Income for Over 90% of Cooperative Members
    Prosperity Does Not Obviate Thrift
    Xinhua News Agency dispatch: In Licheng County, Shandong Province, the Shahe Township Agricultural Cooperative's more than 3,500 mu of winter wheat yielded over 200,000 jin more than last year. Some cooperative cadres then thought: When the large cooperative was first established in the spring, it was poor and short of money, so it was right to be thrifty, but now that the wheat has had a bumper harvest, it doesn't matter if you spend more money, so they planned to add a large number of new farm tools, and also prepared to build the threshing ground in a more lavish style, in order to show the superiority of the large cooperative. They calculated that the total expenditure for these projects would amount to more than 51,000 yuan.
    Many cooperative members opposed this practice after they learned of it. Based on the opinions of the cooperative members, and in the spirit of not forgetting thrift in times of prosperity, the cooperative's management committee criticized the erroneous idea that "it doesn't matter if you spend more money after the wheat has had a bumper harvest," and through democratic discussion, reviewed and revised the original summer expenditure plan. The revised plan determined that the originally planned purchase of more than 44,000 jin of chemical fertilizer would be replaced by cooperative members using methods such as digging bay mud and exchanging pot scrapings to accumulate soil fertilizer. Expenditures on the construction of threshing grounds and the addition of new farm tools were also appropriately reduced in accordance with the spirit of thrift. In this way, summer expenditures were reduced from the original plan of more than 51,000 yuan to 30,400 yuan.
    Due to the reduction in expenditures, the cooperative guaranteed that 97% of its members would have increased incomes compared to last year in the summer distribution. As a result, the cooperative members' enthusiasm for labor soared, and the attendance rate increased from 75% before the summer harvest distribution to more than 90%.
    Income Increased Even for Households with Decreased Production
    Xinhua News Agency dispatch: When the Five-Star Agricultural Production Cooperative in Luodian Buyi Autonomous County, Guizhou Province, announced its trial distribution in mid-June, 179 households in the cooperative increased production, three households maintained production, but there were still six households of cooperative members whose production decreased.
    How can we help the six cooperative members with reduced production increase their income? After a heated discussion, all cooperative members believed that the base fertilizer applied to the paddy fields was too little, and if they applied twice as much top dressing, they could increase production even more; also, if 60,000 plants of Aifen (raw material for manufacturing the valuable medicinal product borneol) were added to the fallow land, another 600 yuan could be earned this year; in addition, there are various sideline businesses that have not yet been developed. As long as these production loopholes are filled, the total income of the entire cooperative can be increased by about 5%. In this way, the cooperative members whose income has already increased will increase even more, and the six cooperative members whose income may decrease, with the exception of one wealthy farmer who cannot increase his income due to having more land and joining the cooperative late, the rest can increase their income by more than 20% compared to last year.
    After finding these ways to increase production that guarantee increased income for every household, the production enthusiasm of all cooperative members has been significantly improved. In the twelve days from the end of the trial calculation on June 13 to June 24, the cooperative had weeded the first round of rice fields half a month earlier than last year, and the second round of corn fields was also weeded clean. 40,000 plants of Aifen were planted in the fallow land. In addition, under the leadership of the cooperative, 48 cooperative members were engaged in sideline businesses such as burning bricks and tiles, fluffing cotton, and engaging in pack horse transportation.

### 保证90％以上社员增加收入

    保证90％以上社员增加收入
    丰收不忘勤俭
    据新华社讯　山东省历城县沙河乡农业社今年的三千五百多亩冬小麦共计比去年增产了二十多万斤。有些社干部便认为：春天大社刚成立的时候，底子空、手头上没有钱，办社要勤俭那是应该的，现在小麦丰收了，多花点钱没啥，于是就计划增添大量的新农具，修场屋也准备排场些，以这样来显示大社的优越性。他们计算一下，这些项目的开支总额达五万一千多元。
    许多社员知道后反对这种做法。社务管理委员会根据社员意见，本着丰收不忘勤俭的精神，批判了那些错误地认为“小麦丰收后多花点钱没啥”的思想，并且通过民主讨论，审查修订了原来的夏季开支计划。修订后的计划确定：原来计划购买的四万四千多斤化学肥料，改由社员用挖湾泥、换锅头等办法积土肥来代替。对修建场屋和增添新农具等开支，也都根据节约精神适当减少。这样，夏季开支便从原计划的五万一千多元，减为三万零四百元。
    由于开支的减少，这个社在夏季分配中保证了97％的社员比去年增加收入。因此，社员的劳动热情高涨，出勤率由夏收分配前的75％提高到90％以上。
    减收户也增加收入
    据新华社讯　贵州省罗甸布依族自治县五星农业生产合作社六月中旬公布试算分配时，全社有179户增产，三户保产，但仍有六户社员减产。
    怎样才能帮助减产的六户社员增加收入呢？全体社员热烈讨论后，认为稻田施底粪较少，如果增施一倍追肥，就能增产更多；又如在轮歇地里要是增种艾粉（制造贵重药品冰片的原料）六万株，今年又能收入六百元；此外还有多种副业没有展开。只要把这些生产漏洞弥补起来，全社总收入就可以增加5％左右。这样，原来增收的社员就增得更多，可能减少收入的六户社员，除一户富农因土地多，入社晚，不能增加收入外，其余的都可比去年的收入增加20％以上。
    找出这些保证户户增加收入的增产门路后，全社社员生产积极性显著提高。从六月十三日结束试算到六月二十四日的十二天中，全社的水稻已比去年提前半月薅完头道，玉米也薅净了二道，在轮歇土里种了艾粉四万株，另外还有四十八个社员在社的领导下，经营烧砖瓦、弹棉花、搞驮马运输等副业。
