Potash Fertilizer Workshop Under Construction

    (Our dispatch) Nanjing, July 18—The Yongli Ning Plant in Nanjing is building a potash fertilizer pilot workshop, which is expected to be completed and put into production in the first quarter of next year.

    Potash fertilizer is one of the important modern chemical fertilizers. To make grain, flax, potatoes and other crops grow strong and abundant, in addition to applying nitrogen and phosphate fertilizers, this potash fertilizer is also needed. But so far, our country does not yet have a chemical plant that manufactures this fertilizer.

    钾肥车间在建设中
    本报讯　南京市永利宁厂正在兴建一个钾肥试制车间，预计可在明年第一季度建成投入生产。
    钾肥是现代重要化学肥料之一，要使谷类、亚麻、马铃薯等农作物生长得茁壮、丰硕，除了施用氮肥、磷肥以外，还需要这种钾肥。但到目前为止，我国还没有制造这种肥料的化学工厂。
