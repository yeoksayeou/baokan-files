How to Improve Vegetable Supply Work
    Song Guangwei

    Recently, we investigated the vegetable stations of the Beijing Vegetable Company, the distribution stations of supply and marketing cooperatives, the joint purchase and sales groups of the retail vegetable industry, individual vendors, and oil and salt shops, and visited the Si Ji Qing Vegetable Production Cooperative. We found that many unreasonable phenomena exist in Beijing's vegetable sales and price management work, making both producers and consumers dissatisfied.

    Many Drawbacks of Guaranteed Purchase and Guaranteed Sales

    Currently, all vegetables in Beijing are purchased and sold by the Municipal Vegetable Company, which concentrates on turnover. More than 200 vegetable production cooperatives in the suburbs must concentrate more than three million catties of vegetables to the four vegetable stations at Fuchengmen, Guang'anmen, Tianqiao, and Chaoyangmen every day. The Vegetable Company weighs and accepts all of them, and then wholesales them to retail units throughout the city from this main entry point. Supply and marketing cooperatives and the joint purchase and sales groups of vegetable vendors, which account for the largest proportion of retail and are most closely related to the general public, must go through distribution stations or the purchasing organizations of joint ventures to distribute the vegetables to retail outlets or vegetable carts. According to the investigation, it generally takes two to three days and five to six handlings for vegetables to be harvested and supplied to citizens, going through three stages. This is very different from the historical vegetable circulation situation in Beijing. According to Shen Duo, director of the Si Ji Qing Production Cooperative (who has 30 years of vegetable growing experience): "In the past, vegetable farmers harvested vegetables one day and put them on the market early the next morning. Vegetable vendors also rushed to the market early, and citizens could buy vegetables early in the morning." That is to say, vegetables went through only one stage from production to consumption, two loadings and one unloading, taking about one day.

    Now, due to the overlapping of distribution organizations and the increase in levels, the following consequences are inevitable: tender vegetables become old vegetables, and fresh vegetables become rotten vegetables; the damage to vegetables increases, with losses of 10%-15% in the vegetable vendors' joint purchase and sales group alone; and the rot at the vegetable stations is even more serious. Vegetable stations of the Vegetable Company, distribution stations of cooperatives, and vegetable industry joint organizations all have inventories at each level, forming large and small reservoirs, artificially causing slow vegetable circulation.

    Violating the Laws of Vegetable Circulation

    Due to the Municipal Vegetable Company's guaranteed purchase and guaranteed sales management methods and the excessive concentration of wholesale markets, vegetables often stagnate at vegetable stations and cannot flow smoothly. Every day, hundreds of trucks from various production cooperatives gather at the vegetable stations to wait for weighing. If a truck could be unloaded as soon as it arrives, it could make two round trips a day, but now it can only make one, seriously affecting production. On the other hand, supply and marketing cooperatives, joint ventures, and oil and salt shops must also queue up at the vegetable stations to wait for purchasing. After queuing for one, they have to queue for another. It takes at least four or five hours to buy all kinds of vegetables. After vegetables are purchased in a guaranteed way, the natural circulation laws of Beijing's vegetables are also disrupted. For example, spinach, bok choy, small radishes, and other vegetables with strong seasonal production, in the past, when they were concentrated on the market, and the urban area could not consume them all, and prices fell, vegetable farmers and vendors would reduce sales to the urban area and increase sales to mountainous areas and grain areas such as Mentougou, Bei'anhe, and Changping County. Now, regardless of the city's consumption volume, the Vegetable Company stipulates that all vegetables must be concentrated at the vegetable stations for guaranteed purchase. This has resulted in the concentration of vegetables in the urban area during the peak season for the past two or three years, exceeding the maximum consumption volume of residents, causing accumulation, price drops, and spoilage, making both producers and consumers dissatisfied, the state losing money, while farmers in the surrounding areas cannot eat cheap vegetables. At the same time, the large-scale concentration and distribution of vegetables has also caused a waste of transportation and labor.

    Joint Purchase and Sales Affect the Enthusiasm of Vegetable Vendors

    According to the data of the Xidan Working Group of the Vegetable Company, before the joint venture, vegetable vendors sold an average of 700 catties of vegetables per person per day, but after the joint venture, they sold less than 300 catties. In the peak season of vegetable marketing in June and July, three of the 20 joint venture groups in the Xidan district still lost money, and one group only paid 75% of its wages in mid-June. The reasons are as follows:

    1. The actual selling of vegetables has decreased, and the actual selling time has been shortened. Taking Xidan Joint Venture Group 11 as an example, this group is composed of 44 vegetable carts. In the past, all 44 carts went to the streets to sell vegetables. Now, only 18 people push carts to the streets to sell vegetables. Nine people sell vegetables at three fixed points, and the remaining 17 people are placed in administration, management, transportation, and purchasing. The actual selling power has decreased by 39%. The people who directly sell vegetables on the streets have not improved their work efficiency due to the above-mentioned division of labor. Although they work more than thirteen or four hours a day, the time spent on loading, paying, counting, and walking to and from work accounts for four or five hours, and the actual time spent meeting consumers is only seven or eight hours. In total, the number of vegetable vendors that consumers can see has decreased by 50%-60%. After the joint venture, the number of vegetable vendors in the city has been reduced from more than 3,200 to more than 2,600, and the existing 2,600 people only play the role of 1,200 to 1,300 people in the past.

    2. The auxiliary labor force of vegetable vendors' families cannot be utilized. Before the joint venture, the wives and children of vegetable vendors had to assist them for one-third of the day, responsible for sorting, washing, and drying vegetables, and sometimes taking care of vegetable carts. Therefore, in the past, more than 3,000 vegetable vendors actually topped the strength of more than 4,000 people. After the joint venture, this batch of strength was abandoned.

    3. The general income of vegetable vendors has decreased after the joint venture, and their wage system is also unreasonable. Most joint venture groups implement a "quota wage plus bonus for exceeding the quota" system, but the sales quotas vary greatly, and the wages vary little. For example, in Xidan Joint Venture Group 3, the basic wage for a monthly sales quota of 450 yuan is 37 yuan; the basic wage for a sales quota of 250 yuan is 30 yuan. The quota differs by 80%, and the wage differs by only 23%. Some people lower the amount of money to be sold in order to get a bonus for exceeding the quota. In order to complete the quota, each vegetable cart only picks fast-selling vegetables. In addition, there are many non-production personnel in the group, forming a situation of "few who produce, many who eat." The income of young and strong people who need to support their families is generally reduced by one-half compared with the past, so they have financial difficulties and unstable emotions, and believe that in the joint venture group, people with strong labor ability suffer losses, and the old and weak benefit, unable to be paid according to their work.

    4. The method of dividing areas and setting points for selling vegetables implemented by the joint venture group (that is, fixing each vegetable cart in one or two alleys, and not allowing each other to cross the boundary) restricts the initiative of vegetable vendors to sell. In the past, vegetable vendors could freely roam the alleys. In order to increase their income, they generally wholesale more, sell more, and run more often. Residents could buy fresh vegetables at the door at any time of the day. After the designated area supply, the vegetable carts generally stop at one point and do not shout or move around, which is very inconvenient for residents. The old and weak vegetable vendors sell fewer vegetables and cannot even supply one or two alleys, so residents have to queue up at the cooperative.

    5. The joint venture also disrupted the organic cooperation of the labor force of merchants in this city. In the past, merchants in the vegetable and fresh fruit industries in Beijing flowed to each other. When the vegetable season needed to increase manpower to promote sales, it was the off-season for fresh fruit, and merchants engaged in fresh fruit would switch to vegetables; when the vegetable season was scarce in August, vegetable vendors would switch to watermelons and other fresh fruits. This was very beneficial to the expansion of sales for both and balanced the seasonal income of merchants. After the joint venture, this natural adjustment of the labor force was disrupted, so vegetables accumulated at vegetable stations, but the sales force felt insufficient, and citizens could not buy vegetables.

    Price Management is Too Rigid and Vegetable Quality Declines

    Commercial administrative departments and the Vegetable Company have too rigid price management for vegetables, regardless of market conditions and commodity characteristics. In order to maintain the uniformity and stability of vegetable retail prices, the Municipal Vegetable Company stipulates that the wholesale-retail margin for leafy vegetables is 40%, and for non-leafy vegetables it is 20%-25% (the range for cooperatives is slightly smaller). This completely changed the past flexible sales methods of vegetable vendors, such as dividing good and bad goods into baskets; selling good goods at high prices, selling inferior goods at low prices, and selling bad goods at cost; high prices for fresh vegetables in the morning and cheap prices in the evening, and "package deals" (this method is very popular among consumers with different purchasing power). This has caused vegetable vendors and supply and marketing cooperatives to universally not process, not sort, not water, not tidy up, and allow vegetables to rot, and then report to the superiors for reimbursement and sell at reduced prices. In addition, the joint venture group stipulates that the damage handled by each vegetable cart itself generally cannot exceed 1.5%. In order to avoid exceeding the damage quota, vegetable vendors are even more reluctant to process and repair. Therefore, the clear impression given to consumers by vegetable carts or vegetable shops in Beijing now is: the quality of vegetables has been greatly reduced, but the price of vegetables is expensive.

    We believe that the above are the main reasons for the current "poor downward flow" of vegetables in Beijing and the failure to satisfy consumers; coupled with some problems that still exist in vegetable production (such as the inability to guarantee the listing plan, and some agricultural production cooperatives rush to collect early at high prices), a large amount of vegetables accumulate and rot at the vegetable stations of the Vegetable Company as soon as the peak season arrives. Including the part that is handled by deterioration and reduced prices, the state has lost 1.1 million yuan from January to June.

    Opinions on Improving Vegetable Supply Work

    In order to solve the problem of vegetable management in Beijing well, according to the characteristics of vegetable production being scattered and consumption being scattered, we put forward the following opinions for consultation with the departments in charge of vegetable management:

    Restore the free transaction of vegetables. Change the current management method of guaranteed purchase and guaranteed sales by the Vegetable Company. In accordance with the principle of facilitating the rapid circulation of vegetables, widely establish vegetable trading markets in urban and suburban areas, where agricultural production cooperatives and retail units can freely trade in the market to accelerate the circulation of vegetables. In order to directly link producers and retailers, and quickly meet retailers and consumers, retail units should be allowed to freely select and purchase in the market and sell in any area of the city, and production cooperatives should be allowed to freely wholesale in any trading market.

    The task of the Vegetable Company is to manage the vegetable market. The Vegetable Company should not be the guarantor of buying and selling vegetables. Because according to the characteristics of vegetables being difficult to store and not suitable for long-distance transfer, guaranteed purchase and guaranteed sales fundamentally violate the law of shortening the circulation time required for operating vegetables, and it is not a good way to promote production and improve vegetable quality. Therefore, the future tasks of the Vegetable Company should be: managing various trading markets in urban and suburban areas; when the vegetable market is abnormal and vegetable prices fluctuate too much, conducting purchases, processing, external transportation, and transfer to regulate market supply and demand; the main business for vegetables produced in this city should be agency business, that is, selling on behalf of agricultural cooperatives or purchasing on behalf of retail units, and charging a certain handling fee. In this way, the difficulties of insufficient sales personnel for agricultural cooperatives and purchasing personnel for retail units can also be solved.

    Vegetable vendors implement a self-financing management method. According to the current situation, it seems that transforming small vegetable vendors by means of joint purchase and sales with shared profits and losses is not a good way. Whether vegetable retail should be concentrated like factories and large department stores, and whether concentration is the most economical and can improve sales efficiency, is worth considering. Therefore, the current joint purchase and sales groups of vegetables should be reorganized according to the willingness of vegetable carts and vegetable vendors, and the management method of joint purchase and sales with shared profits and losses should be changed to joint purchase and distribution or separate purchase and separate sales with self-financing, in order to give full play to their enthusiasm.

    Implement the price policy of high quality for high prices. The current rigid vegetable retail price management method is not in line with the characteristics of vegetable quality changing at all times. According to the principle of selling good goods at good prices and selling bad goods at bad prices, retail units operating vegetables should be allowed to freely grade and freely set prices for sale. In order to prevent the unbridled rise in vegetable prices and prevent speculation, commercial administrative departments can stipulate the highest quality and highest retail price of various vegetables on that day or for a few days, and publish them in the newspaper. Any vegetable vendor can sell below this price but must not sell above this price, and consumers can supervise themselves.

    怎样改进蔬菜供应工作
    宋光炜
    最近，我们调查了北京市菜蔬公司的菜站、供销合作社的分货站和零售点蔬菜业的联购联销组、单干户和油盐店，访问了四季青蔬菜生产合作社，发现北京市蔬菜的销售和价格管理工作，存在许多不合理的现象，使生产者和消费者都不满意。
    包购包销的流弊很多
    目前北京市全部蔬菜，由市菜蔬公司包购包销，集中吞吐。四郊二百多个蔬菜生产合作社，每天要把三百多万斤蔬菜集中到阜城门、广安门、天桥、朝阳门四个菜站，由菜蔬公司过磅包收，然后再由这个总关口批发给全市的零售单位。零售比重最大、和广大市民关系最密切的供销合作社和菜商菜贩的联购联销组，都要经过分货站或联营组的采买机构等等分货环节，才能把菜分配到零售点或菜车上。据调查，从蔬菜采摘到供应到市民手中，一般要经过三道环节，装卸三次，过手五次到六次。在不积压的情况下，需要两天到三天的时间。这和历史上北京市蔬菜流转情况大不相同。据四季青生产社主任申多（他有三十年种菜经验）说：“过去菜农头天收菜，第二天一早上市，菜商菜贩也一早赶市，市民在一清早就能买到菜。”这是说，蔬菜从生产到消费，只经过一道环节，两装一卸，一天左右时间。
    现在，由于分货机构重叠、层次增多，就不可避免地发生了这样的后果：嫩菜变成老菜，鲜菜变成烂菜；蔬菜的伤耗加大，仅菜贩联购联销组一道环节，一般要损耗10％—15％；菜站腐烂的就更多了。菜蔬公司菜站、合作社的分货站和蔬菜业联营组织层层有库存，形成大大小小的贮水池，人为地造成蔬菜流转缓慢。
      违反蔬菜流转规律
    由于市菜蔬公司的包购包销的经营办法和批发市场过于集中，蔬菜经常停滞在菜站，不能畅流。每天，各生产社几百辆大车集中在菜站等候过磅。一辆大车如果随到随卸，一天本可往返两次，现在只能往返一次，严重地影响了生产。另一方面，供销社、联营组和油盐店也必须在菜站排队等候采买，排完这队排那队，要把各种菜买齐，至少要四、五个钟头。蔬菜包购后，也破坏了北京市蔬菜的自然流转规律。例如菠菜、小白菜、小萝卜等生产季节性很强的菜蔬，过去在集中上市，城区消费不完，价格下跌的时候，菜农、菜贩就少往城区运销，多向门头沟、北安河、昌平县等山区、粮区销售。现在菜蔬公司不管城市消费量如何，规定集中在菜站包购，这样就造成两三年来旺季蔬菜集中城区，超过居民的最大消费量，积压、落价、腐烂，生产者、消费者两不满，国家赔钱，而四乡农民又吃不到廉价的菜蔬。同时，由于蔬菜大集中大分散，也造成了运输力和劳动力的浪费。联购联销影响菜贩的积极性
    根据菜蔬公司西单工作组的资料，菜贩在联营以前，每人每天平均推销七百斤菜，联营以后却卖不到三百斤。在六，七月蔬菜上市旺季，西单区二十个联营组还有三个组赔了钱，有一个组在六月中旬只发了75％的工资。原因有以下几个：
    一、实际卖菜的减少，实际卖菜的时间缩短。以西单联营十一组为例，这个组是由44个菜车组成的，过去44个车都上街卖菜，现在推车上街的只有十八个人，有九个人在三个固定点卖菜，其余十七人放在行政、管理、运输、采买上，实际卖菜的力量减少了39％。直接上街卖菜的人并没有因为上述分工提高了工作效率，他们每天虽然都工作在十三，四个小时以上，但花费在装货、交款、点货、上下班走路的时间，就占去四、五个小时，实际和消费者见面的时间只有七、八个小时。二者合计，消费者所能见到的菜贩，整整减少50％—60％。全市在联营后，菜贩本来已由三千二百多人减少为二千六百多人，而现有的二千六百多人，只起过去一千二、三百人的推销作用。
    二、菜贩家庭的辅助劳动力不能利用。联营以前，菜贩的妻子儿女要辅助他们一天劳动的三分之一，负担蔬菜的分等分类，洗晾等工作，有时也照顾菜车。因此，过去三千多菜贩，实际要顶四千多人的力量，联营以后，这批力量就弃而不用了。
    三、菜贩联营后一般收入减少，他们的工资制度也不合理。大多数联营组实行“定额工资加超额奖励制”，但销货定额相差大，工资相差小。例如西单联营三组，每月销货定额450元的，基本工资是37元；销货定额为250元的，基本工资是30元。定额相差80％，工资只相差23％。有的人为了得超额奖，把卖钱额定低，为完成定额，各菜车只拣快销的菜卖。加以组内非生产人员多，形成“生之者寡，食之者众”。一般年轻力壮需要赡养家口的，收入一般较过去减少二分之一，因此生活困难，情绪不稳，认为在联营组内，劳动能力强的人吃亏，老弱沾光，不能按劳取酬。
    四、联营组所实行的划片定点销菜的办法（即把每个菜车固定在一两条胡同，彼此不许越界），束缚了菜贩推销的主动性。过去，菜贩可以自由串胡同，他们为了增加收入，一般多趸、多卖、多跑，经常流动。居民在一天的任何时间，都可在门口买到鲜菜。划片定点供应以后，菜车一般死停一点，不吆喝，不走动，居民很不方便，老弱菜贩推的菜少，连一、二条胡同也供应不上，居民只得到合作社排队。
    五、联营以后还打断了本市商贩劳动力的有机配合。过去，北京市蔬菜和鲜果两行业的商贩是互相流动的，当蔬菜旺季需要增加人力推销的时候，正是鲜果淡季，经营鲜果的商贩便转营蔬菜；当八月蔬菜青黄不接的时候，菜贩便转营西瓜等鲜果，这很有利于二者的扩大推销，平衡商贩的淡旺季收入。联营以后，打断了这种劳动力的自然调剂，因而蔬菜在菜站积压，推销力量却感不足，市民买不到菜。价格管理太死蔬菜质量下降
    商业行政部门和菜蔬公司对蔬菜的价格管理太死，不顾市场情况和商品特点。市菜蔬公司为了保持蔬菜零售价格的划一和稳定，规定菜蔬的批零差率是带叶的40％，不带叶的20％—25％（合作社幅度稍小）。这就完全改变了过去菜贩把好货坏货分筐；好的卖高价，次的卖低价，坏的按本卖；早上菜鲜价高，傍晚贱价和可以“包元”的灵活推销办法（这种办法很受购买力不同的消费者的欢迎），造成菜贩和供销合作社普遍不加工、不分等、不上水、不整理、任凭蔬菜腐烂后，向上级报销，削价出售。加以联营组规定，每个菜车自行处理的伤耗一般不能超过1.5％，菜贩为避免超过伤耗定额，也就更不肯加工整修了。因此，北京市的菜车或菜铺，现在给消费者一个鲜明的印象是：菜的质量大大降低了，菜价却贵了。
    我们认为，以上是造成目前北京市蔬菜“下泄不畅”消费者不能满足的主要原因；再加上蔬菜生产方面尚存在一些问题（如上市计划不能保证，有的农业生产社有赶高价提前集中采摘的情况），因此蔬菜一到旺季就大量在菜蔬公司的菜站积压腐烂，再连变质削价处理的部分计算在内，一至六月就给国家损失了一百一十万元。对改进蔬菜供应工作的意见
    为了很好地解决北京市蔬菜的经营问题，根据蔬菜生产分散，消费分散等供销特点，我们提出以下几点意见，和主管蔬菜经营的部门商榷：
    恢复蔬菜的自由成交。改变目前菜蔬公司包购包销的经营方式，按照有利于蔬菜迅速流转的原则，在城区、郊区广泛成立蔬菜交易市场，由农业生产合作社和零售单位在市场自由成交，以加速蔬菜的流转。为了使生产者和零售商直接挂钩，零售商和消费者迅速见面，应该允许零售单位到场内自由选购，在市内任何地区销售，生产社在任何交易市场自由批发。
    菜蔬公司的任务是管理蔬菜市场。菜蔬公司不应该是蔬菜的包买主和包卖主。因为按照蔬菜不易保管，不宜长途调来调去的特点，包购包销根本违背了经营蔬菜要求缩短流转时间的规律，而且也不是一个好的促进生产提高蔬菜质量的方式。因此，菜蔬公司今后的任务应该是：管理城郊各个交易市场；在蔬菜上市失常、菜价波动过大的时候，进行收购、加工、外运、调进，以调剂市场供求；对本市所产蔬菜以代理业务为主，即代农业社出售或代各零售单位采购，收取一定手续费。这样，也就解决了农业社推销人员和零售单位采购人员人手不足的困难。
    菜贩实行自负盈亏的经营方式。根据目前情况，改造经营菜蔬的小商贩，用联购联销共负盈亏的方式，看来不是一个好办法。蔬菜的零售，是否应该像工厂和大百货商店那样集中起来经营，集中起来是否最经济，是否能够提高卖菜效率，是值得考虑的。因此，应该根据菜车菜贩的自愿，改组目前蔬菜的联购联销组，改变联购联销、共负盈亏的经营方式为联购分销或分购分销自负盈亏的方式，以充分发挥他们的积极性。
    贯彻执行优质优价的价格政策。目前过死的蔬菜零售价格管理办法是和蔬菜质量时刻在变化的特点不相符合的，应该按照好货卖好价，坏货卖坏价的原则，允许经营蔬菜的零售单位自由分等，自由订价出售，为防止菜价漫无节制的上涨，防止投机，商业行政部门可以规定当天或几天各种蔬菜最高质量最高零售价，在报纸上公布，任何菜商菜贩可以低于此价但不得高于此价出售，并由消费者自行监督。
