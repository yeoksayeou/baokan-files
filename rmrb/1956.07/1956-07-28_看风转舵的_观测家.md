    The "Observer" Who Steers with the Wind

    There is a type of cadre who often detaches themselves from the actual situation to jump on the bandwagon. When opposing Right deviation, they blindly raise targets and add tasks, showing they are "advanced." When opposing "Left" deviation, they blindly shrink positions and lower requirements, showing they are "cautious."

    They are not clear about what is "Left" or Right". There is a medicine for people like this, which is: first, require them to have a clear understanding, and then decide what to oppose. Chen Yan

    看风转舵的“观测家”
    有一种干部常常脱离实际情况去赶风头。反右倾了，他们就盲目地提高指标、追加任务，表示“先进”。反“左”倾了，他们又盲目地收缩阵地、降低要求，表示“慎重”。
    究竟是“左”是右，自己并不了然。对这样的人有这样一剂药，就是：先要求心中有数，再决定反对什么。　陈言
