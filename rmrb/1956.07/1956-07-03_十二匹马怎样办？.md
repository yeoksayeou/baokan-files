    What to do with Twelve Horses?
    In mid-May, the Liangqing District Supply and Marketing Cooperative of Yongning County, Guangxi Province, forcibly allocated fourteen horses to the Yudong Agricultural Cooperative. The Yudong Agricultural Cooperative already had basically enough cattle for plowing and had no need for horses at all. Since they had been allocated, they had to be temporarily kept. However, these horses were covered in sores, and so thin that they were just skin and bones. In addition, the cooperative members did not take good care of the horses, and now two of them have died. What to do with the remaining twelve horses? We hope that the relevant departments will deal with this quickly.

    十二匹马怎样办？
    广西省邕宁县良庆区供销合作社在五月中旬硬分配给玉洞农业社十四匹马。玉洞农业社的耕牛已基本够用，根本不需要马。既然分配下来了，只好暂时养着。可是这些马满身是疮，瘦弱得只剩下了骨头，再加上社员们对马的饲养管理不够周到，现在已经有两匹死掉了。剩下的十二匹马怎么办呢？希望有关单位迅速处理。
