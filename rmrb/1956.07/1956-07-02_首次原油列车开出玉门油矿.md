Xinhua News Agency, Yumen, July 1st. The first train fully loaded with crude oil departed eastward from the Yumen Oilfield today. Today, the oil city appeared exceptionally lively. Early in the morning, crowds of people surged towards the station from every corner of the oil city. Female workers and the families of oil workers also put on bright clothes and beat waist drums to celebrate the opening of the crude oil train. Automobile workers, who were still transporting crude oil between the springs of Yumen yesterday, also changed into neat clothes today and came to the station to pay tribute to the railway workers who were hauling the first crude oil train. Before the train started, two oil workers wearing aluminum helmets presented a banner inscribed with "Produce more and better petroleum products to thank you" to Sang Yanwu, the driver of locomotive 3673. When Sang Yanwu and the representatives of the oil workers clasped their hands tightly together, cheers and applause immediately erupted from the crowd of 20,000 people around them.

    首次原油列车开出玉门油矿
    新华社玉门1日电　满载着原油的第一列火车今天从玉门油矿区向东开来。今天，石油城显得分外热闹。清晨，人流从石油城的每一角落拥向车站。女工们和石油工人的家属，也穿起鲜艳的衣服，打着腰鼓前来庆祝原油列车的通车。昨天还在玉门清水间运输原油的汽车工人，今天也换上了整洁的服装，来到车站向拉运第一列原油车的铁路职工致敬。列车开动前，两个戴着铝盔的石油工人，把一面写着“生产出更多更好的石油产品来感谢你们”的锦旗，献给三六七三机车的司机长桑延武。当桑延武和石油工人代表的两双亲密的手握在一起的时候，四周的两万人群中顿时响起了欢呼声和掌声。
