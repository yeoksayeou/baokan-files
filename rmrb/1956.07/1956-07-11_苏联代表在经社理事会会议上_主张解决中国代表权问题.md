Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, 10th Dispatch: At the opening meeting of the 22nd session of the United Nations Economic and Social Council on July 9th, the Soviet representative, Zakharov, spoke advocating for the resolution of the issue of Chinese representation in ECOSOC. He demanded that the Chinese seat, still occupied by Kuomintang elements, be handed over to the People's Republic of China. Representatives from Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, and Indonesia supported this proposal.

The Soviet representative stated that the current situation, where the legitimate government of China, with its 600 million people, is still being artificially prevented from obtaining ECOSOC membership, is abnormal.

However, due to obstruction by the United States, the meeting did not take action on the Soviet proposal.

The important agenda items of this ECOSOC session, held at the League of Nations Building in Geneva, include the state of world economic development in the twelve years since the war, and reports from ECOSOC bodies on issues such as women's rights, drug abuse, and refugees. The meeting will also discuss arranging for the orderly development of the global economy.

The meeting will also review Morocco's application to join ECOSOC. Reports say that the final decision on this issue will be made within this week. Another newly independent North African country, Tunisia, was accepted into ECOSOC at the previous session this spring.

The session is scheduled to last for five weeks.

    苏联代表在经社理事会会议上
    主张解决中国代表权问题
    新华社10日讯　日内瓦消息：在七月九日联合国经济及社会理事会第二十二届会议开幕会议上，苏联代表扎哈罗夫发言，主张解决中国在经社理事会的代表权问题。他要求把仍然被国民党分子占据着的中国席位交给中华人民共和国。捷克斯洛伐克、南斯拉夫和印度尼西亚的代表支持这个建议。
    苏联代表说，现在还在人为地阻挠拥有六亿人口的中国的合法政府取得经社理事会理事国资格的情况，是不正常的。
    但是，由于美国的阻挠，会议没有就苏联的建议采取行动。
    在日内瓦国联大厦举行的这届经社理事会会议的重要议程有战后十二年来的世界经济发展情况、经社理事会各机构关于妇女权利、吸毒和难民等问题的报告。会议还将讨论安排全世界经济有秩序的发展的问题。
    会议并且要审查摩洛哥加入经社理事会的申请。有消息说，关于这个问题的最后决定将在这个星期以内作出。北非的另一个新独立的国家突尼斯已经在今年春季上一届会议上被接受加入经社理事会。
    这次会议的会期预定为五个星期。
