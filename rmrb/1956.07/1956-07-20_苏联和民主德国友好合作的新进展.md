    New Developments in Friendly Cooperation Between the Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic

    The talks between the government delegations of the Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic in Moscow have concluded successfully. In the joint statement issued on the results of the talks, both sides made important decisions on further strengthening the friendly and cooperative relations between the two countries and reiterated their unanimous views on the current international situation, especially on the issue of German reunification.

    The agreement in the statement on enhancing economic cooperation between the two countries fully reflects the Soviet government's sincere concern for the economic development and improvement of the people's living standards in the German Democratic Republic. According to the agreement, the two governments have decided to reduce the German Democratic Republic's expenditures for maintaining the Soviet troops stationed in Germany by half, starting next year, from the original 1.6 billion marks to 800 million marks. At the same time, both sides also decided to expand the volume of goods exchanged under the current trade agreement; the Soviet Union will provide the German Democratic Republic with freely convertible foreign exchange and offer long-term loans on favorable terms. In terms of industrial development, the two countries will further strengthen cooperation; the Soviet Union will supply the German Democratic Republic with a large amount of supplementary resources needed for economic development and help the German Democratic Republic establish an atomic power plant with a generating capacity of 100,000 kilowatts.

    As everyone knows, in recent years, the expenditures of the German Democratic Republic for maintaining the Soviet troops stationed in Germany have gradually decreased. This expenditure has been reduced from more than 2.1 billion marks in 1949 to 1.6 billion marks in 1954. Now, it has been reduced by half, which will greatly reduce the German Democratic Republic's financial burden in this regard, allowing these funds to be used to meet the needs of domestic economic and cultural construction.

    The other items stipulated in the statement will help expand the German Democratic Republic's payment capacity in developing trade with the capitalist world, obtain some important raw materials needed for developing the national economy, and further overcome the consequences of unbalanced industrial development. And all of this, in the final analysis, will guarantee the smooth implementation of the German Democratic Republic's second five-year plan and the further improvement of the people's living standards.

    The statement's proposition on the German reunification issue opens up a correct and possible path for resolving the German reunification issue.

    In the statement, both sides unanimously demanded that German reunification be achieved through direct negotiations and agreements between East and West Germany, and affirmed the new efforts made by the German Democratic Republic in this regard recently. This proposition is reasonable precisely because it is based entirely on the real situation. Today, there are two Germanys with different systems, both of which exercise their own powers within their own territories. This is an objective fact, and no excuse can change this fact. Under such circumstances, only through direct negotiations and agreements between the two Germanys can the German reunification issue be resolved correctly. However, the Western countries, led by the United States, have always obstructed the direct consultation between the two Germanys to resolve the issue of a unified Germany. They close their eyes and completely deny the existence of the growing and strengthening German Democratic Republic. This is a very unrealistic attitude. Recently, the Western countries have once again harped on the old tune of so-called "free elections" and fabricated the so-called slander that the Soviet Union does not want German reunification. These are just excuses for their opposition to German reunification. Their intention is to create a deadlock on the German issue and then use this to delay and obstruct the solution of other major international issues, such as the disarmament issue and the European collective security issue. However, no matter what, the realistic and reasonable propositions put forward by the Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic will sooner or later pave the way for their advancement. The German question is first and foremost a matter for the German people themselves. Only by recognizing the reality of Germany today and in accordance with the interests of the German people and the interests of European peace, can this issue be resolved reasonably. And this day will eventually come.

    The statement calls on Western countries to reduce the number of their troops stationed in West Germany in order to eventually withdraw all foreign troops from Germany. This proposition will undoubtedly be supported by all honest people. Indeed, more than ten years after the end of the war against Germany, the abnormal situation in which a large number of foreign troops are still stationed on German territory should no longer continue. Everyone remembers that the Soviet Union has repeatedly proposed the withdrawal of foreign troops stationed in Germany. Comrade Khrushchev pointed out during the talks between the Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic in September 1955: "If the United States, Britain, and France are willing to do so today, then we can resolve this issue now." However, the Western countries have always lacked sincerity on this issue. But even so, the Soviet Union recently decided to reduce the number of troops stationed in Germany by 50,000. If Western countries can also make the same efforts and reduce their troops stationed in Germany, this would greatly ease the situation in Germany, significantly reduce the potential threat of war in Europe, and be conducive to the peaceful settlement of the German issue.

    The new talks between the government delegations of the Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic once again embodied the new type of relationship between socialist countries, characterized by mutual trust, equal cooperation, and fraternal solidarity. It is a new contribution to strengthening the friendly relations between the two countries and seeking a peaceful settlement of the German issue. It will be welcomed by all those who care about peace and international cooperation.

### 苏联和民主德国友好合作的新进展

    苏联和民主德国友好合作的新进展
    苏联和德意志民主共和国两国政府代表团在莫斯科举行的会谈，已经圆满结束。双方在就会谈结果发表的联合声明中，对进一步加强两国之间的友好合作关系作出了重要的决定，并再一次重申了两国对当前国际局势，特别是对德国统一问题的一致意见。
    会谈声明中关于增进两国经济合作的协议，充分反映了苏联政府对民主德国经济发展和人民生活提高的真诚关怀。根据协议，两国政府决定从明年起减少德意志民主共和国为维持苏联驻德部队而支出的经费的一半，即从原来的十六亿马克减为八亿马克。同时，双方还决定：扩大现行贸易协定所规定的换货数量；苏联将供给民主德国以可以自由兑换的外汇，和提供条件优惠的长期贷款。在发展工业方面，两国将进一步加强合作；苏联将供给民主德国以发展经济所需的大量的补充资源，并帮助民主德国建立一座发电能力为十万瓩的原子能电力站。
    大家知道，最近几年来，民主德国政府为维持苏联驻德部队而支出的经费，是逐渐减低的。这项支出已经从1949年的二十一亿多马克，降为1954年的十六亿马克，现在又减少了一半，这样就可以使得民主德国今后在这方面的财政负担大为减轻，从而可以把这笔费用用来满足国内的经济和文化建设的需要。
    声明中所规定的其他各项，将有助于扩大民主德国在发展对资本主义世界贸易时的支付能力，获得为发展国民经济所需要的一些重要原料，进一步克服工业发展不平衡的后果。而所有这些，归根到底，将保证民主德国第二个五年计划的顺利实现和人民生活水平的进一步提高。
    会谈声明关于德国统一问题的主张，为解决德国统一问题开辟了正确和可能的途径。
    会谈双方在声明中一致要求通过东西德之间的直接谈判和协议，来实现德国的统一，并肯定了德意志民主共和国最近在这方面所作的新的努力。这一主张之所以合理，正是因为它是完全从现实的情况出发的。今天存在着两个制度不同的德国，它们都在自己的领土上行使着自己的权力。这是客观存在的事实，任何借口都不能改变这个事实。在这种情况下，只有通过两个德国之间的直接谈判和协议，才是解决德国统一问题的正确道路。但是，以美国为首的西方国家，它们始终阻挠由两个德国直接协商解决统一德国的问题，它们闭着眼睛，根本否认日益发展和壮大的民主德国的存在，这是很不现实的态度。最近，西方国家又重弹所谓“自由选举”的老调和捏造所谓苏联不愿德国统一的谰言，这只是它们反对德国统一的遁词而已。其意图就是想在德国问题上打下死结，然后再以此来拖延和阻挠其他重大的国际问题——如裁军问题和欧洲集体安全问题的解决。但是，不管怎样，苏联和民主德国所提出的现实的、合理的主张，迟早总会为自己开辟前进的道路。德国问题首先是德国人民自己的事情。只有在承认德国今天的现实的基础上，按照德国人民的利益和欧洲和平的利益，才能合理地解决这个问题。而这一天是总会到来的。
    声明要求西方国家裁减它们驻在西德的军队人数，以便最后从德国撤出一切外国军队。这一主张无疑将受到一切正直人们的支持。的确，在对德战争结束十多年后的今天，在德国领土上仍然驻扎大量外国军队的不正常情况，是再也不应该继续下去了。大家记得，苏联早已屡次提出了撤出驻德外国军队的主张。赫鲁晓夫同志1955年9月在苏联和德意志民主共和国的会谈中就曾指出：“如果美、英、法三国今天愿意这样做的话，那末我们可以在现在就解决这个问题。”而西方国家在这个问题上却一直是缺乏诚意的。但即使如此，苏联最近还是决定裁减驻德军队五万人。如果西方国家也能作同样的努力而裁减自己的驻德军队的话，这就会使德国的局势大大和缓，欧洲潜在的战争威胁显著减轻，并且有利于德国问题的和平解决。
    苏联和德意志民主共和国两国政府代表团之间的新的会谈，再一次体现了社会主义国家之间的相互信任、平等合作和兄弟团结的新型关系。它是对加强两国友好关系和谋求德国问题和平解决的新的贡献。它将受到一切关心和平和国际合作的人们的欢迎。
