    The Tax Bureau Chief Who Disregards Small Matters
    Sun Qian, Haimo
    In a small village in Wenchang County, Hainan Island, we went to see a Hainan opera performance by the famous veteran artist Zheng Changhe and the celebrated actress Wen Hua. The performance was very moving, but we encountered a strange and infuriating incident.
    We arrived there under the clear moonlight. When we received our tickets, our companions were surprised: Strange! The tickets for a performance in this place were stamped with the Tax Bureau's seal.
    We have had similar experiences quite a few times. In Hunan and Guangdong, we have seen such tickets stamped. Afterwards, we asked a comrade from the Cultural Bureau and learned that the stamp meant the Tax Bureau had already collected taxes. However, this was after Chairman Mao and the Ministry of Finance had already announced tax exemption regulations. To get to the bottom of this, we found the local tax officer to inquire. We asked him if he had seen the orders from Chairman Mao and the Ministry of Finance, and he said, "I have." We asked him why he was stamping the tickets, and he said, "To collect taxes." We asked him what kind of tax he was collecting, and he said, "Income tax." The comrades from the troupe standing next to us told us, "They weren't collecting taxes a few days ago, but suddenly they want taxes again these past two days." The tax officer said, "We just received the notice these past two days." Since it's called income tax, logically it should be collected if the troupe has a surplus, but the troupe comrades told us, "Tonight's performance cost 300 yuan, but we only received 200 yuan from ticket sales, losing 100 yuan." But the tax officer said, "We don't care about that—as long as there's a ticket, we're going to collect 1.6% tax." He also said, "I am acting according to orders, this is a regulation from higher-ups."
    Five days ago, we encountered the same situation in Tongshi. Tongshi charged a tax rate of 6.7%, and there was no tax name at all. To thoroughly understand this issue, we visited Vice Director Li of the Wenchang County Tax Bureau first thing the next morning. This Vice Director was an old tax worker, not very old, and looked quite smart. Vice Director Li brought a large stack of documents, and when we asked him to introduce the situation regarding the implementation of entertainment tax reductions and exemptions here, he concluded, "We have implemented the published regulations here—we no longer tax opera performances."
    "That's strange!" we asked him, "If the tax is exempt, why are you still stamping the tickets? Why did you cancel the entertainment tax and immediately start collecting income tax?"
    Vice Director Li was stunned for a moment, then stuttered, "I seem to remember receiving a document about income tax a few days ago."
    We wanted to see that document or ask Vice Director Li to talk about its contents. He said, "The document is gone, (God knows where it went!) and I don't remember the content."
    We simply couldn't understand it: such a big matter, and the dignified Vice Director of the Wenchang County Tax Bureau doesn't know about it. Then who ordered the tax collection?
    Vice Director Li said, "The secretary looks at the documents. After the secretary looks at them, he hands them over to the business section. These small matters are handled directly by the business section."
    Look, our country's serious tax work is being treated as a "small matter" by people like Vice Director Li, allowing his secretary and business section to handle it casually. Not only that, but our Vice Director Li is not interested in his own work, but he pays close attention to the price of tickets. Before the tax exemption, the highest ticket price here was seven jiao; after the tax exemption, the ticket price became six jiao. Why? Because Vice Director Li felt that the tax exemption order was only for the audience, not for the "actors." With the tax exempt, of course, the ticket price must be lowered.
    This is not considered strange, the strangest thing is: the things that the Tax Bureau does – exempting taxes, lowering ticket prices, collecting strange income taxes – the CCP Wenchang County Committee knows nothing about.
    Until now, we have not figured out why so many places are unwilling to implement the entertainment tax reduction and exemption regulations. However, Vice Director Li of Wenchang County does not study the documents from the higher-ups and pushes it to the secretary and the business section to handle the tax "small matters," this is indeed true.

    ·旅途杂感·
    不管小事的税务局长
    孙谦  海默
    在海南岛文昌县的一个小村中，我们曾去看过著名老艺人郑长和及名旦文华演出的海南戏。戏演得很令人感动，但是遇到了一件怪事，却又令人气愤。
    我们是趁着明净的月色赶到这里的。当我们拿到戏票的时候，和我们同行的人都惊讶起来了：奇怪！在这个地方演出，戏票也盖了税务局的图章。
    类似的经历，我们已遇到不少。在湖南，在广东，都见过这种盖了图章的戏票。事后我们问过一位文化局的同志，才知道票面盖有税务局的图章就是说明税务局已经收过税了。可是现在的时间是毛泽东主席和财政部已经公布了免税条令以后。为了弄清真相，我们曾找到此地的税务员去请教过。我们问他看到过毛泽东主席和财政部的命令没有，他说：“看过。”我们问他为什么要在戏票上盖图章，他说：“为了收税。”我们问他收什么税，他说：“所得税。”站在我们身边的剧团同志告诉我们说：“前几天还不收税，这两天忽然又要税了。”税务员说：“我们这两天才接到了通知。”既然叫所得税，论理应该是剧团收入有盈余，可是剧团同志告诉我们说：“今晚演戏的成本是三百元，票钱才收到二百元，亏本一百元。”可是税务员却说：“我们不管那些——反正有一张票，我们就要收1.6％的税。”他还说：“我是照命令办事，这是上级的规定。”
    五天以前，我们在通什也碰到过同样的情况。通什收的税率却是6.7％，而且根本没有什么税名。为了彻底弄清这个问题，第二天天一亮，我们就访问了文昌县税务局李副局长。这位副局长是位老税务工作者，年纪不大，看模样蛮机灵，李副局长抱了一大叠文件来，当我们请他介绍一下这里执行减免娱乐税情况的时候，他却下结论似地说：“我们这里已按公布的条令执行了——唱戏的不再抽税了。”
    “这就怪了！”我们问他：“既然免了税，为什么还要在戏票上盖图章？为什么取消了娱乐税马上又要抽所得税？”
    李副局长愣了一阵，然后吃吃地说：“我仿佛记得前几天接到过一个关于所得税的公文。”
    我们想看一看那件公文，或者请李副局长讲讲公文的内容。他说：“公文不在了，（鬼知道到哪里去了！）内容，我记不得了。”
    我们简直无法理解了：这么件大事情，堂堂的文昌县税务局副局长都不清楚，那么是谁下命令收税的呢？
    李副局长说：“公文是秘书看的。秘书看过了，就把它交给业务科，这些小事儿，都是业务科直接办的。”
    请看，我们国家严肃的税收工作，就被李副局长这样的人当作“小事”儿，让他的秘书和业务科随便地处理了。不仅如此，我们这位李副局长对于他的本行工作是没有兴趣的，可是对票价的高低却十分注意。免税以前，这里最高的票价是七角；免税以后，这里的票价变成六角了。为什么呢？因为李副局长觉得免税命令是只对观众，不对“戏子”。免了税，当然票价就得降低。
    这还不算奇怪，最奇怪的是：税务局干的免税、压低票价、征收古怪的所得税这些事情，中共文昌县委会却一点也不知道。
    直到现在我们还没有搞清楚：为什么这样许多地方对减免娱乐税条例根本不愿实行？可是文昌县的李副局长不研究上级公文，推托给秘书和业务科办理税收“小事”，这倒是确实的。
