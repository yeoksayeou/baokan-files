What is Dulles' "Morality"?
    Cui Qi
    Recently, U.S. Secretary of State Dulles has repeatedly attacked neutralism, insisting that it is "immoral" because neutralism "finds security" in "indifference to others."

    Dulles cursed neutral countries, but dared not name them. At a press conference on July 11, people asked Dulles which countries were considered neutral? He only cited Switzerland as an example. Then, is Switzerland's neutrality immoral? He said, no. So, which neutral countries are immoral? Dulles said he thought there were very few. It seems that Dulles broke into an empty house and shouted and cursed, not knowing who he was attacking.

    But this kind of indirect trick is not clever, because Dulles himself has clearly said that he believes: "Some countries that condemn genuine collective security treaties" have "incorrect" neutral views. This is very clear: Dulles is attacking those countries that refuse and oppose joining U.S. military blocs. However, he said that such countries are "very few," which is a lie. American political commentator Lippmann has annotated Dulles' remarks attacking neutralism, writing: "This statement is an all-encompassing generalization, because in Europe, neutrality includes Sweden, Switzerland, and Ireland, not to mention Austria and Finland; in Asia, it includes India, Burma, Ceylon, and Indonesia; in the Middle East, it includes all Arab countries except Iraq; and if one looks at the facts, it would include many Latin American countries." Thus, according to Dulles' logic, wouldn't most countries in the world be "immoral" today?

    Dulles arrogantly hates neutralism, but his accusation of neutralism is very ridiculous. Why is neutralism "indifference to others"? Everyone knows that the concern of countries that implement a neutral policy is national independence and world peace. They advocate peaceful coexistence among all countries in the world and advocate promoting international cooperation. This is of course beneficial to the people of all countries. On the contrary, the United States' policy of strength and Cold War policy are creating estrangement, suspicion, division, and confrontation between countries everywhere. Therefore, it is not difficult for us to see that Dulles' curse of neutralism for being "indifferent to others" actually refers to the fact that these countries are unwilling to serve the United States' policy of strength and Cold War policy. And this is what Dulles considers the most "immoral" thing.

    Dulles has repeatedly asserted that other countries can only obtain "security" by joining U.S. military blocs and squatting under the U.S. "protective umbrella." However, what kind of "security" is this? People have seen what the situation is like in those countries that are "protected" by the United States. Their territories are full of U.S. military bases, their territorial waters are patrolled by U.S. fleets, and their airspace is roaring with U.S. aircraft. Moreover, everything in these countries is incorporated into the Pentagon's adventurous plans, and they lose all rights to control their own destiny for the sake of "security."

    People say that the U.S. military bloc is a large prison, which is very appropriate. After all, no one in the world wants to enjoy this kind of "security" inside the prison, because people cherish freedom. However, Dulles has scolded everyone who is unwilling to "find security" in this way as "immoral"!

    History tells us that aggressors have always hated neutralism. Because, in the eyes of aggressors, other countries can only be objects of aggression or tools of aggression. Neutral countries are unwilling to be invaded by others, and are unwilling to act as accomplices of aggressors, and become a stumbling block to aggressors. This is the real reason why all aggressors hate neutral countries, and this is the real reason why Dulles curses neutral countries as "immoral."

    Dulles and Nixon and other powerful American figures fantasize that if they shout a few times, neutral countries will be intimidated, and the neutral sentiments of those countries that have been dragged into U.S. military blocs will no longer grow. But the facts are exactly the opposite. Dulles and his ilk have miscalculated again. Their attacks on neutralism can only arouse the indignation of all honest people who care about peace, and at the same time, people will more resolutely rise up to defend peace. Indian Prime Minister Nehru pointed out: "Dulles and Nixon's attitude is a product of the Cold War. It is meaningless except as a threat to wage a hot war." Indonesian Prime Minister Sastroamidjojo refuted Dulles and Nixon's views, saying: "Regarding the concept of military alliances as a means of avoiding war, according to the experience gained throughout human history, it is now very clear that the arms race will only result in war," therefore, we should "do our best to prevent the next war from happening." These replies undoubtedly express the common opinions of the people of peaceful neutral countries.

    Dulles confessed that he has attacked neutralism fifty-one times. This Secretary of State always likes to narrate his heroic stories of how he fought windmills, and deliberately forgets the various records of how he was shot down from his horse along with his gun. He only knows how to constantly blackmail, constantly deceive, and constantly brag about himself. What he cares about is only the profits of certain American groups to which he belongs, and he is "indifferent" to everything else. The "morality" that this kind of person has is nothing more than loyalty to the profits of monopoly capital.

### 杜勒斯的“道德”是什么？

    杜勒斯的“道德”是什么？
    崔奇
    最近期间，美国国务卿杜勒斯接连攻击中立主义，并坚持说，由于中立主义在“对别人漠不关心当中”“找到安全”，所以是“不道德的”。
    杜勒斯咒骂中立国家，但又不敢指名。在七月十一日的记者招待会上，人们问杜勒斯，究竟哪些国家算是中立的呢？他只举出瑞士为例。那末，瑞士的中立是不是不道德的呢？他又说，不是。那末，究竟哪些中立国家是不道德的呢？杜勒斯说，他想是极少的。看来，杜勒斯好像闯进一所空房子里大喊大骂，不知道攻击的是谁。
    但是这种指桑骂槐的伎俩并不高明，因为杜勒斯自己明明说过，他认为：“有些谴责真正的集体安全条约的国家”就有着“错误”的中立观点。这就非常明白了：杜勒斯攻击的是那些拒绝和反对参加美国军事集团的国家。不过，他说这种国家是“极少”的，这是谎话。美国政论家李普曼已经给杜勒斯攻击中立主义的言论作了注解，他写道：“这种说法是一种无所不包的概括，因为在欧洲，中立包括瑞典、瑞士和爱尔兰，且不提奥地利和芬兰；在亚洲，它包括印度、缅甸、锡兰和印度尼西亚；在中东，它包括除伊拉克以外的所有的阿拉伯国家；如果人们看一下事实，那末它会包括许多拉丁美洲国家。”这样，按照杜勒斯的逻辑，岂不是今天世界上大部分国家都是“不道德”的了。
    杜勒斯狂妄地仇视中立主义，但是他对中立主义的指责却是非常可笑的。中立主义为什么就是“对别人漠不关心”呢？谁都知道，实行中立政策的国家所关心的就是民族独立和世界和平，它们主张世界各国和平共处，并主张促进国际合作。这对各国人民当然都是有好处的。相反的，美国的实力政策和冷战政策却在到处制造各国之间的隔阂、猜疑、分裂和对立。因此我们不难看出，杜勒斯咒骂中立主义“对别人漠不关心”，实际上是指的这些国家不愿意为美国实力政策和冷战政策效劳。而这就是杜勒斯认为最“不道德”的事了。
    杜勒斯一再断言，别的国家只有加入美国军事集团，蹲在美国的“保护伞”下，才可以得到“安全”。然而，这是怎样一种“安全”呢？人们都看到那些受到美国“保护”的国家是一种什么景况。它们的国土上遍布美国军事基地，它们的领海上巡行着美国舰队，它们的领空轰鸣着美国飞机。而且，这些国家的一切都被纳入五角大楼的冒险计划中，它们为了“安全”而失去自己掌握自己命运的一切权利。
    人们说，美国的军事集团是一所大监狱，这再恰当没有了。世界上毕竟没有人愿意享受这种监狱里面的“安全”，因为人们珍爱自由。但是，杜勒斯却大骂凡是不肯按照这种方式来“找到安全”的人都是“不道德”的！
    历史告诉我们，从来的侵略者都是仇视中立主义的。因为，在侵略者看来，别的国家只有作为侵略的对象，或者作为侵略的工具。中立国家不愿意遭受别人侵犯，又不愿意充当侵略者的帮凶，而且成为对侵略者的一种绊脚石，这就是一切侵略者所以仇视中立国家的真正原因，这也就是杜勒斯所以咒骂中立国家“不道德”的真正原因。
    杜勒斯和尼克松之流的美国有势力人物妄想，他们大喝几声，中立国家就会被吓倒，而那些被拉进美国军事集团的国家的中立情绪，也就不会再滋长了。但事实恰恰相反，杜勒斯之流又失算了。他们对中立主义的攻击，只能引起一切正直的关心和平的人士的愤慨，同时人们将更坚决地起来保卫和平。印度总理尼赫鲁指出：“杜勒斯、尼克松的态度是冷战的产物。除了作为进行热战的威胁以外是毫无意义的。”印度尼西亚总理沙斯特罗阿米佐约驳斥杜勒斯和尼克松的观点说：“关于以军事联盟作为避免战争的手段这个概念，根据在人类历史的整个过程中所获得的经验，现在已经很明显，军备竞赛结果只会是战争”，因此应该“尽力防止发生下一次的战争”。他们的这些答复无疑表达了和平中立国家人民共同的意见。
    杜勒斯自白，他攻击中立主义已经有五十一次了。这位国务卿总是喜欢叙说他如何斗风车的英雄故事，而故意忘掉他怎样连人带枪被打下马来的种种记录。他只知道不断地讹诈，不断地欺骗，又不断地自我吹嘘。他所关心的只是他所属的美国某些集团的利润，别的他一概“漠不关心”。这种人所有的“道德”，不过对垄断资本的利润的忠诚而已。
