The Utilization of Infrared Light

In the summer, after the rain, rainbows with seven colors of red, orange, yellow, green, cyan, blue, and violet often appear in the sky. These colored lights all belong to electromagnetic waves, but their wavelengths are different, with red light having the longest wavelength. Infrared light has an even longer wavelength than red light. However, infrared light is invisible. The reflection, scattering, and absorption of infrared light by matter are different from those of visible light, giving it special uses.

The scattering of infrared light in thin fog is weaker than that of visible light, allowing it to penetrate thin fog. Therefore, infrared photography can be used to capture scenery behind thin fog. Using photoelectric materials and fluorescent screens sensitive to infrared light, image converters can also be made. By using such an image converter, the surrounding situation can be detected in the dark.

Infrared light can also be used for communication. First, the oscillation of sound is transformed into variations in the intensity of infrared light, which is then emitted. At a distance, this infrared light is collected and converted back into sound oscillations, allowing the other party's voice to be heard. Although the distance for transmitting signals using this method cannot be too far, it is not susceptible to interference and is not easily detected by others.

By utilizing the phenomena that infrared light causes in semiconductors, such as its ability to change the resistance of a semiconductor, highly sensitive detectors can be made. Infrared light can be used to detect ice reefs in the ocean, aircraft in the air, and can also be used as relay components in automatic control systems.

Studying the absorption of infrared light by substances can help determine the molecular structure of the substances. With this data, rapid product analysis can be carried out in production, which can then be used to automatically control the production process.

Infrared light is easily absorbed by paint, plastics, grains, paper, and other materials, and can dry them without significantly raising their temperature. This is also commonly used in industry. (Xu Xurong)

    红外光的利用
    夏天雨后的空中常有红、橙、黄、绿、青、蓝、紫七色彩虹出现。这些色光同属电磁波，只是波长不同，以红光的波长为最长。而红外光的波长还要长。不过红外光是看不见的。物质对红外光的反射、散射及吸收都和可见光不同，因而有它特别的用处。
    红外光在薄雾中的散射比可见光弱，可以透过薄雾。所以利用红外光摄影，可以照出薄雾后的景致。利用对红外光灵敏的光电材料和荧光屏，还可以作成像转变器。使用这种像转变器，可以在黑暗中探知周围的情况。
    利用红外光还可以通讯。先把声音的振荡变成红外光的强弱的变化，然后把红外光射出去。在远处收集起这种红外光，并把它回复到声音的振荡，就可以听见对方的声音。这种方法虽然传送讯号的距离不能太远，但是却不致受到干扰，也不容易被人发觉。
    利用红外光对半导体引起的一些现象，例如它可以改变半导体的电阻，也可以作出很灵敏的探测器。利用红外光可探测海洋中的冰礁，空中的飞机，也可以利用它作成自动控制中的继电元件。
    研究红外光被物质吸收的情况，可以判断物质的分子结构等。有了这些数据就可以在生产中进行产品的快速分析，进而用来自动控制生产过程。
    红外光容易被漆、塑料、谷类、纸张等所吸收，并且使它们的温度不太升高就可被晒干。这也是工业中常用的。　（徐叙瑢 ）
