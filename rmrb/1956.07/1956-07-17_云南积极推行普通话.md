Yunnan Actively Promotes Mandarin Chinese

(Our newspaper dispatch) Over one hundred counties and cities in Yunnan Province have already opened Mandarin Chinese training classes. According to incomplete statistics, more than 11,000 primary school teachers and some personnel from government organizations have participated in Mandarin Chinese learning. In some primary schools in Kunming, Xiaguan, Yiliang, Yuxi and other places, Mandarin Chinese has already begun to be used for teaching. This autumn, more than 350,000 first-grade primary school students will switch to Mandarin Chinese for instruction. In the first half of the year, the Provincial Department of Education held two sessions of Beijing pronunciation instructor training classes, training 443 primary school teachers from 134 counties and cities, including 73 teachers from Hui, Minjia, Naxi, Dai, Yi, Miao, Tu, Sha, and Lisu ethnic groups. The Provincial Department of Education also requested that various localities train 12,000 primary school teachers before the summer vacation. Party committees at all levels have attached great importance to the promotion of Mandarin Chinese learning. At the beginning of the learning process in counties such as Chengjiang and Lunan, the heads of the county party committees also made mobilization reports. In the training class in Lunan County, the instructors adopted ethnic forms for teaching. Training classes in various localities also paid special attention to sorting out the correspondence between local dialects and Beijing pronunciation. The Yunnan Provincial Beijing Pronunciation Training Class has initially sorted out the rough correspondence between the dialects of 99 counties and cities and Beijing pronunciation.
