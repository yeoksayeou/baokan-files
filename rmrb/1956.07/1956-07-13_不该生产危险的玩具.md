    Dangerous Toys Should Not Be Produced
    Yu Weizhou, an employee of the Tianshui Locomotive Depot, recently bought a wooden toy pistol at a toy store in Beijing. The gun has a spring and rubber bullets at the muzzle, which can be fired as far as one meter. When his four-year-old child was playing with this toy pistol, because the adults were not paying attention, he aimed and shot at someone, blinding a two-year-old child in one eye. Such unfortunate events are probably not isolated. Therefore, I suggest that toy factories no longer produce such dangerous toys, and parents should also refrain from choosing such toys that have no educational value for their children.

    不该生产危险的玩具
    天水机务段职工于维周，最近在北京玩具店买了一只木制玩具小手枪，枪上有弹簧，枪口有胶皮弹，可以发射一公尺远。他四岁的孩子玩这种小手枪的时候，因为大人一时照顾不到，他对着人瞄准射击，把一个两岁孩子的眼睛打瞎了。像这样不幸的事，恐怕不只一起。所以，我建议玩具工厂不要再生产这种危险的玩具，家长们最好也不给孩子选择这种没有教育意义的玩具。　（徐邦显）
