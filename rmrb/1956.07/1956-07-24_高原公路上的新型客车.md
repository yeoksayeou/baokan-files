Xinhua News Agency Report:

    The nine electric-style new passenger buses, recently remodeled by the local state-owned Kunming Automobile Repair Plant, have begun operating on the Kunming-Luoyang and other highways in the Yunnan Plateau.

    The appearance of this new type of passenger bus is beautiful, and it is more spacious and comfortable than the old-fashioned passenger buses, and there is less dust when driving. Taking this new type of passenger bus can reduce travel fatigue.

    This type of passenger bus was designed by the technicians of the Yunnan Provincial Transportation Department Transportation Bureau, based on the conditions of many bends and steep slopes on the Yunnan Plateau highways, and with reference to the style of the Hungarian Ikarus 55 passenger bus. Within next year, 75% of the province's old passenger buses will be converted into new ones.

    高原公路上的新型客车
    据新华社讯　地方国营昆明汽车修配厂最近改装的九辆电车式的新型客车，已经开始在云南高原的昆洛等公路上行驶。
    这种新型客车的外表美观，比老式客车宽敞、舒适，行车的时候灰尘也少。坐这种新型客车，可以减少旅途的疲劳。
    这种客车是云南省交通厅运输局的技术人员，根据云南高原公路弯多坡陡的情况，参考匈牙利依克罗斯五十五型客车的式样设计出来的。明年内全省75％的老式客车，都将改装成新型的。
