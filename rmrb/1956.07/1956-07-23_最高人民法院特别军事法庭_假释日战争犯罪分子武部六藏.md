Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, July 22nd. The Special Military Tribunal of the Supreme People's Court of the People's Republic of China announced in Shenyang on July 21st the parole of Japanese war criminal Mutobe Rokuzo, who had been sentenced to twenty years in prison. The Special Military Tribunal's ruling was made based on the application of the person in charge of the War Criminals Management Office of the Shenyang Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army and the doctor's diagnosis. The Special Military Tribunal held that Mutobe Rokuzo was suffering from a serious illness and had behaved relatively well during his detention, and therefore granted him parole.

The full text of the ruling of the Special Military Tribunal of the Supreme People's Court of the People's Republic of China is as follows:

Defendant Mutobe Rokuzo, male, born in 1893, from Kanazawa City, Ishikawa Prefecture, Japan, former Director-General of the General Affairs Agency of the Puppet Manchurian State Council, currently in custody.

Regarding the aforementioned defendant's war crimes case, this court sentenced him to twenty years of imprisonment on July 20, 1956. Sun Mingzhai, Director of the War Criminals Management Office of the Shenyang Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, applied to this court, stating: Defendant Mutobe Rokuzo has been suffering from hypertension and hemiplegia for four years. Repeated treatments have been ineffective. Furthermore, Mutobe Rokuzo has shown good repentance during his detention. May we grant him parole so that he can return home to recuperate? We hereby request your consideration and decision. This court appointed Pan Shaozhou, professor of internal medicine at the First Affiliated Hospital of the China Medical University, to provide a medical assessment, which diagnosed:

"Mutobe Rokuzo,
    1. Hypertension,
    2. Arteriosclerosis,
    3. Cerebral thrombosis,
    4. Left-side spastic paralysis. Based on the above conditions, this person's health is unlikely to recover." Accordingly, this court considers that Mutobe Rokuzo is suffering from a serious illness and has behaved relatively well during his detention, and hereby grants parole. This is our ruling.

Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, July 22nd. Japanese war criminal Mutobe Rokuzo, who was granted parole by the Special Military Tribunal of the People's Republic of China, burst into tears when he heard the reading of the ruling this afternoon. He said, "I simply don't know how to thank you enough."

At 1:00 PM, Military Law Lieutenant Lou Yu, the clerk of the Special Military Tribunal, went to Mutobe Rokuzo's residence, handed him the parole ruling, and read the full text of the ruling on the spot. Mutobe Rokuzo was so moved that he burst into tears, repeatedly raising his right hand to his forehead, and thanking the clerk in both Chinese and Japanese. He said, "I did many bad things in China, and I simply don't know how to thank you enough." He said he "never dreamed of being released so quickly."

After the announcement of the parole, the staff of the War Criminals Management Office returned all his belongings left in the management office to him. In the evening, he took a train from Shenyang to Tianjin, preparing to return to Japan.
