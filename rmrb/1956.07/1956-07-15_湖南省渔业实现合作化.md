Changsha Electric News from our newspaper: In Hunan Province, over 11,000 fishing households have all joined advanced fishery production cooperatives by the beginning of July. In the Dongting Lake area and along the Xiang, Zi, Yuan, and Li rivers, over 50,000 households, including both full-time fishermen and those who fish as a sideline, have mostly joined nearby agricultural cooperatives or formed fishery cooperatives. This spring, the more than 10,000 fishing households that had not yet established cooperatives urgently requested the establishment of advanced cooperatives. In order to meet the fishermen's demands for developing production and improving their lives, Party organizations at all levels in Hunan Province helped them make preparations in May and June. Now, these collective fishermen are actively repairing and purchasing fishing gear, preparing for the upcoming peak fishing season.

    湖南省渔业实现合作化
    本报长沙电　湖南省一万一千多户渔民，在七月上旬全部参加了高级渔业生产合作社。在洞庭湖滨和湘、资、沅、澧四水沿岸，原有渔民和以鱼为副业的渔民五万多户，大部都参加了附近的农业社或组成了渔业社。今年春季，尚未建社的一万多户渔民，迫切要求成立高级社。湖南省各级党组织为了满足渔民发展生产、改善生活的要求，在五、六月份就帮助他们做好准备；现在，这些集体渔民正积极修整和添购鱼具，迎接捕鱼旺季的到来。
