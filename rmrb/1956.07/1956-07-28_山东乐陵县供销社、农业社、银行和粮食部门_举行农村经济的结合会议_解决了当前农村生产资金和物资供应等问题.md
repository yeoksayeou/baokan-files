    Shandong Leling County Supply and Marketing Cooperative, Agricultural Cooperative, Bank, and Grain Department
    Hold a Meeting on the Integration of Rural Economy
    Solved Current Problems in Rural Production Funds and Material Supply
    The rural economic work integration meeting held by the Leling County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party of Shandong Province has timely solved some current problems in rural areas, which is of great significance for developing agricultural production and striving for a bumper harvest this autumn. Through this meeting, the previous cumbersome procedures for agricultural cooperatives to obtain loans and purchase production materials were simplified; the problem of stockpiling of materials in supply and marketing cooperatives was resolved; the bank's loans can be issued appropriately; and the unreasonable use of grain prepayment deposits can be avoided. Rural work is very complicated. One cannot just shout slogans of leadership, nor can one stay in the stages of "investigation" and "queueing" for a long time. It is hoped that party committees in various places will pay attention to the experience of Leling County in holding meetings on the integration of rural economic work, and create more and better methods for leading rural economic work based on specific conditions.
    (Reported by our newspaper) The Leling County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party of Shandong Province recently convened a rural economic work integration meeting attended by the directors of supply and marketing cooperatives, bank business offices, agricultural production cooperatives, and grain management offices in various districts, and initially solved four major current rural problems: the supply of materials, the issuance of agricultural loans, the financial difficulties of agricultural cooperatives, and the prepayment of unified purchase grain payments.
    A total of 512 combined supply and marketing, and loan contracts were signed at this integration meeting. The contracts stipulate that the total value of goods supplied will reach 194,000 yuan. In addition to a portion of the funds prepared by the agricultural cooperatives themselves, the bank will issue loans of more than 111,000 yuan. There is still a shortage of more than 40,000 yuan. It was decided to adopt the method of paying upon delivery or using grain prepayment by the grain department to solve the problem. In order to implement the spirit of the meeting and ensure the implementation of the contract, the Leling County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has transferred 70 cadres to go deep into various districts to check the implementation. Improper places in the signed contract will be assisted in revision in a timely manner.
    The Leling County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party decided to convene this meeting after conducting an in-depth inspection of rural work. During the inspection, the county party committee found that the county supply and marketing cooperative had a large amount of fertilizer and pesticides in stock that had not been released, while the agricultural cooperatives were in urgent need of these things. Where is the problem? The main reason is that agricultural cooperatives lack funds. The inspection also found that in the work of issuing loans, banks often have inappropriate and "buck-passing" phenomena, and grain prepayment deposits are sometimes not used for production. Therefore, only by making comprehensive arrangements for these four aspects of work can various tasks be coordinated in a timely manner. Facts have proved that this kind of integration meeting has indeed achieved twice the result with half the effort. For example, the director of an agricultural cooperative in the third district said: "This time, there is no need to worry. If we lack money, we will have money. If we lack medicine, we will have medicine. If we need topdressing, we will have fertilizer. We are confident of a bumper harvest this year." The director of the supply and marketing cooperative in the second district said: "I have never done such a hard work with little effect in recent years." District party secretaries generally reflected that the county party committee's measures were very timely and also pointed out a path for our future work.
    The Leling County's integration meeting was successful because the party committee made preparations for various specific tasks in advance. For example, before the meeting, it organized nine accountants from relevant units to study the procedures for signing contracts, so that the agricultural cooperatives could get loans and buy physical goods in a timely manner through one contract. Giving play to the spirit of mutual consultation has also solved some seemingly difficult problems. For example, some materials of the county supply and marketing cooperative were stored in other counties, and they could not be supplied in a timely manner due to insufficient transportation capacity. After discussing this issue with the directors of various agricultural cooperatives, many directors said that the transportation fee would be paid by the supply and marketing cooperative, and the agricultural cooperative could be responsible for the transportation themselves. At that time, five agricultural cooperatives agreed to transport 220,000 jin of materials.
    This meeting also has some shortcomings, mainly due to insufficient ideological mobilization and some work preparations. For example, some agricultural cooperative directors still have the idea of ​​simply relying on state support and are unwilling to invest their own funds in production; some agricultural cooperatives did not study loan and purchase plans in advance; the supply and marketing cooperative's promotion of goods was also insufficient, resulting in some difficulties in signing contracts.

    山东乐陵县供销社、农业社、银行和粮食部门
    举行农村经济的结合会议
    解决了当前农村生产资金和物资供应等问题
    中共山东省乐陵县委会召开的农村经济工作结合会议，及时地解决了农村中当前的一些问题，这对发展农业生产和争取今年秋季丰收有重大作用。通过这种会议，简化了农业社过去贷款和购买生产资料的层层手续；解决了供销社的物资积压的问题；可以使银行的贷款发放得适当；还可以避免粮食预付订金使用不合理的现象。农村工作是十分复杂的，不能空喊领导，也不能长期停留在“摸底”和“排队”的阶段。希望各地党委重视乐陵县召开农村经济工作结合会议的经验，并且根据具体情况创造出更多更好的领导农村经济工作的方法。
    本报讯　中共山东省乐陵县委会在最近召开各区供销合作社、银行营业所、农业生产合作社和粮食管理所主任参加的农村经济工作结合会议，初步解决了当前农村物资供应、发放农业贷款、农业社资金困难和预付统购粮款四大问题。
    这次结合会议共签订了512份有关供销、贷款的结合合同。合同中规定供应货物总值达十九万四千多元；购买货物的款项，除农业社自备一部分外，由银行发出贷款十一万一千多元，尚缺四万多元，决定采取随提货随交款或由粮食部门预付统购粮款的办法来解决。为了贯彻会议精神和保证合同的实现，中共乐陵县委会已抽调七十名干部深入各区，检查执行情况，对所订合同不妥当的地方将及时协助修订。
    中共乐陵县委召开这次会议，是深入检查农村工作以后作出的决定。县委在检查工作中发现县供销社积存大批肥料和农药没有下放，而农业社则急需这批东西。问题在哪里呢？主要是农业社缺乏资金。检查还发现银行在发放贷款工作中，往往有不恰当和“扯皮”的现象，粮食预付订金有时又用不到生产上去。因此只有把这四方面的工作进行全面的安排，才可以把各项工作及时地配合起来。事实证明，这种结合会议确实收到了事半功倍的效果。例如第三区有的农业社主任说：“这回不愁了，缺钱有了钱，缺药有药，上追肥有了肥料，今年丰收有把握了。”第二区供销社主任说：“几年来也没有做这样费力少收效大的买卖。”区委书记们普遍反映：县委的这项措施很适时，同时也为我们今后的工作指出了一条道路。
    乐陵县这次结合会议开得好，是由于党委在事前进行了各项具体工作的准备。例如在会议前，就组织了各有关单位的九名会计，研究签订合同的手续，以便通过一份合同就可以使农业社既能得到贷款，又能及时买到实物。发挥大家互相商量的精神，也使一些看来很困难的问题得到了解决。像县供销社有些物资存在外县，因为运输力不足不能及时供应。这个问题和各农业社的主任研究后，不少社主任表示，运费由供销社付给，农业社可以自行负责运输。当时就有五个农业社答应包运物资二十二万斤。
    这次会议还有一些缺点，主要是思想动员和某些工作准备不够。像某些农业社主任还存在单纯依靠国家扶持的思想，不愿把自有资金投入生产；有些农业社没有在事前研究贷款和买货的计划；供销社推销货物的宣传工作也做得不够，以致在签订合同时发生一些困难。
