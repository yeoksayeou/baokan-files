Shenyang Reduces Water, Electricity, and Transportation Fees

(Our newspaper Shenyang, July 27th dispatch) Under the leadership and guidance of the Shenyang Municipal People's Committee, relevant departments in Shenyang have formulated a series of measures to improve the people's lives.

Currently, measures regarding the adjustment of public utilities, medical drugs, and park fees have been drafted. According to this preliminary measure, the price of tap water will be reduced from 11 cents per ton to 7 cents per ton. Tram and bus fares will also be slightly reduced, and the sale of monthly passes for employees will be increased, with a wider range of preferential treatment for monthly passes, allowing employees to reduce transportation costs by 30% to 42%. The closing time for trams and buses in the evening has also been generally extended by half an hour. The charging standards for medical drugs, any parts that exceed the standards stipulated by the province, will be reduced to within the standards stipulated by the province. Although the charging standards are within the province's regulations, those that are excessively high will also be appropriately adjusted. The overall average reduction in ten medical expenses, such as consultation, injection, photography, laboratory tests, surgery, and treatment fees, will be approximately 20%. Regarding park fees, the price of boat rentals is expected to be reduced from the current 60 cents per hour to 40 cents per hour, and the free admission standard for children visiting parks will also be appropriately relaxed.

In order to further ensure the supply of non-staple foods and improve the operation of the service industry, efforts will be made to supply more pork in the fourth quarter. The market's "early start" system will also be changed to all-day trading. State-owned non-staple food departments will implement measures such as receiving vegetables several times a day and "high quality for high price, different prices for different grades" to ensure that consumers bear reasonable costs. Bathhouses should increase the supply of towels and soap and improve service attitudes. In addition, it is also planned to add three to four well-equipped barber shops. Restaurants in the already jointly-operated catering industry will reduce the price of dishes by 5%.

    沈阳降低水电交通费
    本报沈阳27日电　沈阳市各有关部门在市人民委员会的领导和主持下，拟定了改善人民生活的各项措施方案。
    目前，有关调整公用事业、医疗药品和园林收费等项措施已经拟定出来。根据这个初步措施，自来水价将由每吨一角一分降到每吨七分。电车、公共汽车票价也略有降低，并增售职工月票和扩大月票的优待幅度，可使职工减少交通费用30％到42％。电车和汽车晚间的收车时间也普遍延长了半小时。医疗药品的收费标准，凡超出省规定标准的部分，一律降到省规定的标准以内，收费标准虽然在省规定以内，但是收费偏高的，也予以适当调整。在诊察、注射、照像、化验、手术、处置费等十项医疗费用上总平均降低20％左右。园林收费标准方面，划船票价准备由现在每小时六角降到四角，儿童游园的免费标准也将适当放宽。
    为了进一步保证副食品的供应和改进服务业的经营，争取在第四季度多供应一些猪肉，还将把市场的“早行”制度改为整天交易；在国营副食部实行每天几次进菜和“优质优价，分等论价”的办法，使消费者负担合理。浴池业要增加毛巾、肥皂和改进服务态度。另外，还准备增设三个到四个设备较齐全的理发馆。已经合营的饮食业的饭馆，菜的价格将降低5％。
