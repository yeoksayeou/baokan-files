The counter-revolutionary novel *Storm and Thunder*, under the guise of "writing about agricultural collectivization," viciously slanders the socialist new countryside after the establishment of communes. In the pen of the counter-revolutionary Chen Dengke, our countryside is depicted as a world of utter darkness, a world of "misery and desolation." In his view, to save this "miserable and desolate" world, a "savior" is needed. This "savior" is the "just and upright official" Zho Yongkang, whom Chen Dengke meticulously portrays in *Storm and Thunder* as someone who "acts on behalf of the people."

Zho Yongkang is the central character throughout the novel, the "hero" figure that Chen Dengke praises highly. In the opening chapters, the novel repeatedly describes how Zho Yongkang conducts undercover investigations in Huabei. In the midst of heavy snow and "disaster-stricken" Huabei Plain, he braves the cold, travels everywhere, and secretly investigates, appearing as a "clean official" in disguise in a detective novel. The main purpose of his undercover investigation is to "find his father." The first time he appears, it is at a dog meat stall, where he asks Yang Xiuying about "finding his father"; on his way to Huangni Township, he thinks about "finding his father"; when he talks with Wan Shou Nian, the central topic is still "finding his father."

What does "finding his father" mean? Why does the plot of this novel revolve around and develop from "finding his father"? Chen Dengke himself admits: "Do not interpret 'finding his father' too narrowly. 'Finding his father' means finding the people, finding the truth of the Party." Why is it necessary to "find the people" and "find the truth of the Party"? Chen Dengke clearly answers through Zho Yongkang's mouth: In the past, those who "received the help of the people of Huabei during the war" have now forgotten their "rebirth parents" and forgotten their "responsibilities to the masses," causing the Party's truth, that is, the flesh-and-blood connection between the Party and the people, to be destroyed. Now, a figure like Zho "the Just Official" is needed to restore this connection, care for the people, and "act on behalf of the people."

Great Leader Chairman Mao pointed out: "What distinguishes us Communists from all other political parties is that we have the closest ties with the broadest masses of the people." Our Party is armed with great Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, serves the people wholeheartedly, and maintains close ties with the masses, which is our Party's glorious tradition. However, Chen Dengke and his ilk slander that our Party has forgotten the people and lost the truth, which is the most vicious attack on our great, glorious, and correct Party.

Zho Yongkang conducts his undercover investigation in Huabei at the critical moment when the people are facing life-and-death struggles of hunger and cold. Before Zho Yongkang's undercover investigation in Huangni Township, the world there was as dark as night; when Zho Yongkang conducts his undercover investigation in Huangni Township, the people there eagerly hope he will stay; and when he decides to "settle down" there, this "dark world" immediately becomes bright, and even the oil lamp on the table seems brighter. All these descriptions indicate that Zho Yongkang's undercover investigation and "finding his father" are entirely from a counter-revolutionary standpoint, viciously attacking our Party for forgetting the people and betraying the people. Only Zho Yongkang, the "just official," does not forget the people and is the sole representative and defender of the people's interests. This is the evil intention behind Chen Dengke's creation of this character.

If the opening chapters of *Storm and Thunder* praise Zho "the Just Official" for his "virtue" of always remembering the people through his undercover investigation, then the scene at Meijia Ferry portrays Zho "the Just Official" as a "savior" who descends from the heavens to save the people. At that time, the severely disaster-stricken Huangni Township was in turmoil. Zho "the Just Official" brought 300,000 catties of rice, led dozens of sailboats, stood at the bow, and directed the "course of navigation," rushing to Meijia Ferry port. As soon as Zho Yongkang arrived, he "scared everyone present into a stupor," and in his "thunderous voice," the grain riot was easily suppressed. Miraculous legends quickly spread in Huangni Township. This time, Chen Dengke deliberately painted a picture for Zho "the Just Official" that was completely different from his undercover investigation. Look: "Morning fog dissipates," "snow melts," "river ice thaws," what a beautiful early spring scene!

"Thawing" is a political term often used by imperialists, modern revisionists, and reactionaries of various countries. In their minds, socialism is a world of frozen snow and ice. They madly call for "thawing," which means to overthrow the leadership of the Communist Party and overthrow the dictatorship of the proletariat. Chen Dengke curses that our countryside under the illumination of Mao Zedong Thought has no sunshine, no warmth, and no vitality; but as soon as Zho "the Just Official" arrives, the ice melts and the snow thaws, and spring returns to the earth. Isn't this saying that our broad masses of the people need to be saved by "heroes" like Zho Yongkang? Isn't this saying that our socialist society needs to be "transformed" by "just officials" like Zho Yongkang? The "savior" Zho "the Just Official" embodies Chen Dengke's strong desire for restoration, and Chen Dengke is also fervently hoping for a counter-revolutionary restoration of "thawing" in China!

After Zho "the Just Official" takes office, he immediately begins to implement his so-called benevolent rule in Huangni Township. He brings 300,000 catties of rice, providing relief to the hungry people of Huangni Township; he guides the "three elders" (He Lao Jiu, Wan Shou Yu, Li Xue Cheng) and the "three flowers" (Jin Hua, Yin Hua, Cui Hua) to weave mats, finding them a "profitable" way to make money; he investigates He Lao Jiu, Li Xue Cheng, and others, finding that the political root cause of Huangni Township's "many disasters and misfortunes" lies in "evil people in power," thereby rectifying "wrong cases" and clearing the injustice suffered by Ren Wei Qu; he punishes Zhu Xikun and Xiong Bin for "harming the people," and with his own "virtues and good deeds," he reforms Fang Xudong. In short, Zho "the Just Official" relieves the famine, rectifies wrong cases, and saves the people who are in "deep water and fiery pits." To beautify this "just official," Chen Dengke specially arranges a legend, portraying this Zho "the Just Official" as the embodiment of the people's "certain emotions, wishes, and demands." Zho Yongkang becomes the spokesman of the people, becoming the "just official" who saves the people and brings them blessings.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "To overthrow a regime, one must first create public opinion and do ideological work. The revolutionary class is like this, and the counter-revolutionary class is also like this." Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, using various means, including literature and art, to advocate for "just officials" and promote the idea of "pleading for the people" and "acting on behalf of the people," is a preparation of public opinion for the bourgeoisie to seize power from the proletariat and carry out capitalist restoration.

From 1960 to 1962, domestic and foreign class enemies stirred up a storm. A group of counter-revolutionary revisionist writers nurtured by the bourgeois headquarters led by China's Khrushchev had once raised the idol of the "just official," hoisted the black flag of "pleading for the people," fiercely attacked the Three Red Banners, attacked the dictatorship of the proletariat, attacked our great leader Chairman Mao, rehabilitated right-opportunists, and incited all ghosts and monsters to seize power from the proletariat. Whether it was Hai Qingtian in the works of Wu Han and Zhou Xinfan, or Xie Xun'an in the works of Tian Han, they were all "heroes" of "pleading for the people," all incarnations of a handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists. China's Khrushchev and his gang eagerly raised the idol of the "just official" to create public opinion for their own usurpation of the Party, the government, and the military.

Li Baohua, the agent of China's Khrushchev, after taking office in Anhui, immediately worked to establish the idol of "Li Qingtian." How "Comrade Baohua" secretly investigated and rectified "wrong cases," how the "just official" cared for the people and was "democratic and humble," and so on. He viciously attacked the Three Red Banners, attacked the dictatorship of the proletariat, attacked the great Mao Zedong Thought, and sounded the gong for the great restoration of capitalism in Anhui.

The Zho Yongkang in *Storm and Thunder* is precisely the incarnation of this handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists. On November 22, 1962, at a writers' conference held by the former Anhui Provincial Party Committee, Chen Dengke specially declared: "Can we write about the many legends of the people when Li Baohua came to Anhui?" During the same period, he also spread the rumor that China's Khrushchev "disguised himself to investigate the situation..." It is clear that Chen Dengke worked so hard to create and praise Zho Yongkang with the purpose of erecting monuments for China's Khrushchev and his agents in Anhui, Li Baohua and his gang, to create public opinion for their usurpation of the Party, the government, and the military. It is precisely for this reason that the "just official" who was demoted in *Finding Father* became a victorious "hero" in *Storm and Thunder*, not only did Xiong Bin become a defeated general under Zho Yongkang, but Fang Xudong also "deeply" reflected in front of Zho "the Just Official" and finally followed Zho Yongkang to "advance." The counter-revolutionary coup that China's Khrushchev and his gang dreamt of day and night was completely realized in *Storm and Thunder*.

Listen, through Zho Yongkang's mouth, Chen Dengke is not issuing a arrogant "challenge" to our proletarian dictatorship, demanding that Zho "the Just Official" take the stage to "rebuild the stove"? Look, following Zho "the Just Official," is not a wave of black wind of restoring capitalism coming at us? It is only polite to return the favor! We must use the mirror of Mao Zedong Thought to expose their counter-revolutionary faces of the "just officials" in broad daylight; we must use the thousand-catty hammer of Mao Zedong Thought to strike down China's Khrushchev and sweep all the likes of Zho "the Just Official" into the garbage heap of history!

### 祝永康是谁家的“英雄”

    祝永康是谁家的“英雄”
    战犹酣
    反动小说《风雷》，打着“写农业合作化”的幌子，极力污蔑公社化后的社会主义新农村。在反革命分子陈登科的笔下，我们的农村一团漆黑，完全是一个“困苦凄凉”的世界。在他看来，为了拯救这个“困苦凄凉”的世界，需要一个“救世主”。这个“救世主”，就是他在《风雷》中精心塑造的“为民作主”的“青天大人”祝永康。
    祝永康是贯串全书的中心人物，是陈登科极力歌颂的“英雄”人物。小说开头几章，就不厌其烦地写他如何私访淮北。他在大雪漫天，“灾荒压顶”的淮北平原上，冒着严寒，四处奔走，明察暗访，俨然是一个公案小说中微服出行的“清官”。私访的主要目的则是为了“寻父”。他第一次出现在狗肉摊上，向羊秀英提出的问题是“寻父”；他在去黄泥乡的路上，思索的是“寻父”；他同万寿年夜话家常，中心话题还是“寻父”。
      “寻父”到底是什么意思？为什么这部小说的情节要用“寻父”来贯串和展开？陈登科自己招供说：“对‘寻父’不要理解得太狭隘，‘寻父’就是寻找人民，寻找党的真理。”为什么要“寻找人民”，“寻找党的真理”呢？陈登科借祝永康之口作了明确的回答：当年
  “在战火纷飞中得到淮北人民救助的”那些人，今天已经忘记了自己的“再生父母”，忘记了对人民群众“应尽的责任”，使党的真理即党和人民群众的血肉联系遭到了破坏。现在需要祝“青天”式的人物来恢复这种联系，关心人民，“为民作主”了。
    伟大领袖毛主席指出：“我们共产党人区别于其他任何政党的又一个显著的标志，就是和最广大的人民群众取得最密切的联系。”我们的党是用伟大的马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想武装起来的党，全心全意地为人民服务，密切联系群众，是我们党的光荣传统。陈登科之流却胡说我们党忘记了人民，失去了真理，这是对我们伟大、光荣、正确的党的最恶毒的攻击。
    祝永康是在所谓人民群众“饥寒交迫”的生死关头，来淮北私访、“寻父”的。祝永康私访黄泥乡之前，那个世界是多么天昏地暗；祝永康私访黄泥乡时，那里的群众又是多么热切地希望他留下来；而当他决定在此“安家落户”时，这个“黑暗世界”立即奇迹似的出现了光明，连“桌上的煤油灯也更显得明亮了”。这种种描写都说明：祝永康私访、“寻父”，完全是站在反革命的立场上，恶毒攻击我们党忘记了人民，背叛了人民，只有祝永康这个“青天”才不忘人民，才是人民利益唯一的代表者和维护者。这就是陈登科塑造这个人物的罪恶用心。
    如果说，《风雷》开头几章，通过私访来颂扬祝“青天”时时不忘人民的“美德”，那末，梅家渡口一场，则通过祝“青天”的走马上任，把他打扮成一个拯救人民，“从天而降”的“救世主”。当时，灾荒严重的黄泥乡正在闹事。祝“青天”带着三十万斤大米，领着几十只帆船，“立在船头”，指示着“航行的方向”，疾驰梅家渡口。祝永康一到，“把在场的人全部吓得目瞪口呆”，在他那“春雷一般轰鸣”的喊声中，这场闹粮风波轻而易举地平息了。神奇般的传说，在黄泥乡迅速地流传开来。祝“青天”这次出场，陈登科特意为他描绘了一幅与私访时截然不同的画面。你看：“晨雾消散”，“积雪融化”，“河水解冻”，好一派“早春气候”！
      “解冻”，是帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派惯用的政治语言。在他们的心目中，社会主义就是雪压冰封的酷寒世界。他们疯狂叫嚣“解冻”，就是要推翻共产党的领导，颠覆无产阶级专政。陈登科诅咒我们毛泽东思想阳光照耀下的公社化后的农村没有阳光，没有温暖，没有一点生气；而祝“青天”一来，就冰化雪融，春回大地。这不是说我们广大的人民群众要由祝永康这样的“英雄”来解救吗？这不是说我们的社会主义社会要由祝永康这样的“青天”来“改造”吗？祝“青天”这个“救世主”身上寄托了陈登科多么强烈的复辟幻想，陈登科又是多么狂热地希望在中国实现反革命复辟的“解冻”啊！
    祝“青天”上任之后，立即就开始在黄泥乡施行他的所谓仁政。他带来三十万斤大米，使黄泥乡的饥民得到了“赈济”；他指点
  “三老”（何老九、万寿余、李学成）、“三花”（金花、银花、翠花）们编席，为他们找到了“本薄利厚”的生财之道；他察访了何老九、李学成等人，找出了黄泥乡“多灾多难”的政治根源在于“坏人当道”，从而平反了“冤案”，昭雪了任为群的冤屈；他惩处了“残害老百姓”的朱锡坤、熊彬，并以自己的“美德懿行”感化了方旭东。总之，祝“青天”在黄泥乡赈灾荒，平冤案，拯救了处在“水深火热”中的人民。为了美化这位“青天”，陈登科还特意安排了一个传说，把这位祝“青天”鼓吹为人民群众的“内心的某种情绪、愿望和要求”的寄托者。祝永康成了人民的代言人，成了救世济民的“青天”。
    毛主席教导我们：“凡是要推翻一个政权，总要先造成舆论，总要先做意识形态方面的工作。革命的阶级是这样，反革命的阶级也是这样。”在无产阶级专政条件下，通过种种手段，包括文艺这种手段，鼓吹“青天”式的人物，宣扬“为民请命”、“为民作主”的思想，是资产阶级向无产阶级夺权，实行资本主义复辟的一种舆论准备。
    一九六○年至一九六二年，国内外的阶级敌人刮起了一阵乌云。以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部所豢养的一批反革命修正主义文人，曾经抬出了“青天”这个偶像，扯起了“为民请命”的黑旗，疯狂地攻击三面红旗，攻击无产阶级专政，攻击我们伟大领袖毛主席，为右倾机会主义分子翻案，鼓动一切牛鬼蛇神起来向无产阶级夺权。不论是吴晗、周信芳笔下的海青天，还是田汉笔下的谢巡按，都是这种“为民请命”的“英雄”，都是一小撮反革命修正主义分子的化身。中国赫鲁晓夫一伙极力抬出“青天”的偶像，就是为他们自己篡党、篡政、篡军制造舆论的。
    中国赫鲁晓夫的代理人李葆华，到安徽上任之后，便极力树立“李青天”的偶像。什么“葆华书记”如何私察暗访、平反“冤狱”呀，什么“青天大人”如何“关心群众”、“民主、谦虚”呀，等等。他恶毒攻击三面红旗，攻击无产阶级专政，攻击伟大的毛泽东思想，为在安徽大搞资本主义复辟鸣锣开道。
    《风雷》中的祝永康，正是这一小撮反革命修正主义分子的化身。一九六二年十一月二十二日，在旧安徽省委召开的一次作家会议上，陈登科特地表白：李葆华“来安徽，群众有许多传说，可以不可以写？”同一时期，他还散布过什么中国赫鲁晓夫“化装下去摸情况……。”十分清楚，陈登科如此卖力地塑造、歌颂祝永康，目的就是替中国赫鲁晓夫及其在安徽的代理人李葆华一伙树碑立传，为他们篡党、篡政、篡军制造舆论。也正因为如此，《寻父记》中被罢官的“青天”，在《风雷》中变成了胜利的“英雄”，不仅熊彬成了祝永康手下的败将，方旭东也在祝“青天”面前“沉痛”地检讨，最后，跟着祝永康一道“前进”。中国赫鲁晓夫一伙日夜梦想的反革命政变，在《风雷》中得到了完全的实现。
    听吧，通过祝永康之口，陈登科不是向我们无产阶级专政发出了狂妄的“挑战”，要让祝“青天”上台“另砌灶锅”吗！看吧，跟在祝“青天”之后向我们扑来的，不是一阵阵复辟资本主义的黑风吗！来而不往非礼也！我们一定要用毛泽东思想的照妖镜，把他们“青天”的反革命嘴脸，暴露在光天化日之下；我们一定要奋起毛泽东思想的千钧棒，打倒中国赫鲁晓夫，把祝“青天”之流统统扫进历史的垃圾堆！
