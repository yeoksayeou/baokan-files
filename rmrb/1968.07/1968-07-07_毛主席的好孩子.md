	Chairman Mao's Good Children

	In our brigade, the primary school student Liu Yajun, in the bitterly cold winter, would always rush to the embankment and landfill construction site after school every day. Once he arrived at the site, he would pick up his pickaxe and start working. The ground was frozen solid, and it shook his hands until they cracked, but he did not complain about the hardship or the fatigue; instead, he worked with even more enthusiasm. Someone asked him why he did not do his own family's work? He replied: "No matter how big our family's affairs are, they are still small matters. Building the embankment and landfill for the collective is a big matter. If we do not actively work on the embankment and landfill, how can we produce more grain to support national construction? To learn from Zhang Side, we must serve the people wholeheartedly! To learn from Norman Bethune, we must be selfless and dedicated to others!"

	Under the nurturing of Mao Zedong Thought, many primary school students in our village, like Liu Yajun, are not afraid of the cold or fatigue, and they fight against nature. They use their lunch break to help the brigade repair roads, collect manure, and gather rabbit grass. They are not afraid of the dark or the long distances, and in the evenings, they propagate Mao Zedong Thought. Whenever Chairman Mao issues new directives, they immediately carry Chairman Mao's portrait, beat drums and gongs, shout slogans, and go door to door to propagate the directives, never delaying until the next day. The villagers all praise them as Chairman Mao's good children.

    毛主席的好孩子
    我们大队的小学生刘亚君，在寒风刺骨的冬天，每天放学后，总是往闸沟垫地的工地跑。一到工地，他抡起镐就干。地冻得梆梆硬，把手震裂了，他不叫苦，不叫累，越干越起劲。有人问他为什么不干自家的活？他回答：“咱家的事再大也是小事，为集体闸沟垫地才是大事。不积极搞闸沟垫地，怎么能多打粮食支援国家建设？学习张思德，就得全心全意为人民服务！学习白求恩，就得毫不利己专门利人！”在毛泽东思想的哺育下，我们村的很多小学生，都象刘亚君那样，不怕寒冷，不怕疲劳，战天斗地。他们利用中午休息时间，给大队修道，拾粪，弄兔草。他们不怕天黑路远，在晚上宣传毛泽东思想。每当毛主席发出最新指示，他们马上就抬着毛主席像，敲锣打鼓，高呼口号，挨家挨户宣传，从不过夜，社员们都夸他们是毛主席的好孩子。
