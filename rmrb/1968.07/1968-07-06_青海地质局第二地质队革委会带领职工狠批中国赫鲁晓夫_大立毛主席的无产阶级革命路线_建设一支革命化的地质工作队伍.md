The Revolutionary Committee of the Second Geological Brigade of Qinghai Geological Bureau leads all geological workers in the brigade to use the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to severely criticize the counterrevolutionary revisionist line of the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents on the geological front, and to uphold Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. The revolutionary spirit of all workers in the brigade has been completely renewed, and revolutionary enthusiasm has reached an unprecedented level, initiating a wave of seizing revolution and promoting production.

After the establishment of the Revolutionary Committee of the Second Geological Brigade, it guided the broad revolutionary workers to further seriously study Chairman Mao's teachings on class and class struggle. Through study, the revolutionary workers have a deeper understanding that the struggle between the two lines on the geological front has always been intense. The main points of contention are twofold: one is the question of relying on whom, whether to rely on a few bourgeois "experts" and "authorities," or to rely on the broad revolutionary masses? The other is the question of the construction of the geological workforce, whether to lead the geological workforce down the "white expert" road, or to build a revolutionary geological workforce that holds high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and emphasizes proletarian politics?

The revolutionary geological workers of this brigade closely focused on these two issues and carried out in-depth revolutionary criticism and struggle. They severely criticized and repudiated the counterrevolutionary revisionist line of the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents, and upheld Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

Great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "The people, and the people alone, are the motive force in the creation of world history." "The socialist revolution and socialist construction must adhere to the mass line, mobilize the masses, and launch mass movements." The revolutionary geological workers of the Second Geological Brigade said that Chairman Mao's instructions are the fundamental guidelines for geological work and all work. However, the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents on the geological front openly opposed Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and opposed launching mass movements in geological work. For a long time, they stubbornly pushed the revisionist "expert line," believed in foreign dogmas, praised bourgeois reactionary technical "authorities," and regarded the broad masses of workers and geological workers as "fools." They did not consult the masses on the direction, purpose, tasks, and layout of geological work, but let a few so-called "experts" who never went to the grassroots or to the mines decide everything, causing losses to the work of the Second Geological Brigade. The broad revolutionary workers angrily denounced that the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents on the geological front, in order to try to make the revisionist line prevail on the geological front, also extensively promoted the black "Modesty" and peddled the theory of "tamed tools," using high-pressure methods to suppress the opinions of the masses. The broad revolutionary workers wanted to arrange a project according to objective realities but could not do so at all, while to verify the so-called "judgments" of those bourgeois "experts" and "authorities," they could start projects without restrictions, sometimes wasting state funds of tens of thousands or even hundreds of thousands of yuan with just one word from an "expert."

Focusing on the issue of whether to follow the mass line or the "expert" line, the Revolutionary Committee of the Second Brigade organized the masses to launch a revolutionary criticism and struggle. Everyone realized that this was a matter of which road geological work would take, whether it would take the socialist road or the capitalist road. The ideological awareness of the broad workers was greatly heightened, and they harbored deep hatred for the revisionist line and boundless love for Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Under the leadership of the Revolutionary Committee, a wave of struggle, criticism, and transformation swept through the brigade. The Revolutionary Committee took revolutionary measures, mobilized the masses to discuss in depth this year's production tasks and layout, and also liberated a large amount of geological data that had been "imprisoned" in the past, turning it into active data for the masses to grasp. At the same time, they mobilized everyone to propose many new mineral clues. The revolutionary geological workers of the Second Brigade said with confidence: "We revolutionary masses have taken hold of the power of geological work. As long as we hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, geological work is not helpless but has great potential." They are determined to have their hearts in the country and their eyes on the world, to find minerals for the country's socialist construction for a lifetime.

Chairman Mao said: "In the realm of production struggle and scientific experiment, mankind is constantly developing, and nature is constantly developing. It will never stop at one level. Therefore, mankind must constantly summarize experience, make discoveries, inventions, creations, and progress. The theory of stagnation, the theory of pessimism, the theory of doing nothing and self-satisfaction are all wrong." Under the leadership of the Revolutionary Committee, the workers of the Second Geological Brigade summarized the past experiences and lessons and unanimously believed that to build a socialist geological cause, it is necessary to kick away the "foreign framework" and walk our own road. They followed Chairman Mao's instructions, changed the past tendency of "single-minded" mineral exploration, rationally utilized mineral resources; and followed Chairman Mao's instruction of "preparing for war, preparing for famine, and serving the people," determined the focus of future geological work. Engineers and technical personnel changed their past style of being detached from reality and the masses, went to the production front line to work with the broad masses, gaining first-hand data and tempering themselves.

In the construction of the geological workforce, the struggle between the two lines is reflected in whether to emphasize proletarian politics or to emphasize technology and business. Chairman Mao teaches us: "Political work is the lifeline of all economic work." To build the geological workforce according to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, it is necessary to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, walk the road of emphasizing proletarian politics, and build a revolutionary geological workforce. The Chinese Khrushchev and his agents on the geological front, however, did everything they could to oppose emphasizing proletarian politics, oppose Mao Zedong Thought, and oppose the mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought. They advocated "technology first," "business in command," and spread the fallacies of "good production is good politics," "everything will be fine once a big mine is found," etc. They also promoted the "bonus system" and practiced material incentives, attempting to lead the geological workforce down the revisionist road of "working for mineral exploration, and mineral exploration for money."

In the revolutionary criticism and struggle, the broad revolutionary workers of the Second Geological Brigade listed a large number of facts, deeply exposing the heinous crimes of a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party who opposed building the geological workforce with Mao Zedong Thought.

Chairman Mao said: "The Red Army was able to fight hard and not disintegrate because 'the party branch is established at the company level' is an important reason." After studying Chairman Mao's instructions, the comrades of the Revolutionary Committee of the Second Geological Brigade deeply realized that strengthening the ideological and organizational construction at the grassroots level is a key issue in the revolutionary transformation of the geological workforce. How to strengthen the ideological and organizational construction at the grassroots level? They first focused on the study of Chairman Mao's works, raising the class struggle consciousness and line struggle consciousness of the broad masses. At the same time, they vigorously learned from the experience of the People's Liberation Army in emphasizing proletarian politics, and built the grassroots organizations according to the system of army companies. Each detachment has a detachment commander, political instructor, and revolutionary mass representatives to form the grassroots leadership cadre. After a period of practice, it was proven that using Mao Zedong Thought to strengthen grassroots construction has greatly enhanced the revolutionary nature, scientific nature, and organizational discipline of the geological workforce.

    青海地质局第二地质队革委会带领职工狠批中国赫鲁晓夫
    大立毛主席的无产阶级革命路线
    建设一支革命化的地质工作队伍
    据新华社西宁五日电　青海省地质局第二地质队革命委员会带领全队地质工作人员，以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人在地质战线上推行的反革命修正主义路线，大立毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，全队革命职工精神面貌焕然一新，革命干劲空前高涨，掀起了抓革命、促生产的热潮。
    第二地质队的革命委员会成立以后，就引导广大革命职工进一步认真学习毛主席关于阶级和阶级斗争的教导。通过学习，革命职工们更深刻地认识到，地质战线上的两条路线斗争一直是很激烈的。斗争的焦点主要有两个方面：一个是依靠谁的问题，是依靠少数资产阶级“专家”、“权威”呢，还是依靠广大革命群众？另一个是地质工作队伍的建设问题，是把地质队伍带上“白专”道路呢，还是建设一支高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗的突出无产阶级政治的革命化的地质工作队伍？这个队的革命地质工作者紧紧围绕着这两个问题，深入地开展革命大批判，大破中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人的反革命修正主义路线，大立毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“人民，只有人民，才是创造世界历史的动力。”“社会主义革命和社会主义建设，必须坚持群众路线，放手发动群众，大搞群众运动。”第二地质队的革命地质工作者说，毛主席的指示是地质工作和一切工作的根本方针，而中国赫鲁晓夫及其在地质战线的代理人，却公开对抗毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，反对在地质工作中大搞群众运动。他们长期以来顽固地推行修正主义的“专家路线”，迷信洋教条，吹捧资产阶级的反动技术“权威”，把广大的工人群众和地质工作人员视为“阿斗”，对地质工作的方向、目的、任务、布局，根本不和群众商量，都是由几个从来不到基层、不上矿山的所谓的“专家”说了算，给第二地质队的工作造成了损失。广大革命职工愤怒地控诉说，中国赫鲁晓夫及其在地质战线的代理人，为了妄图使修正主义路线在地质战线上畅行无阻，还大肆宣扬黑《修养》，贩卖“驯服工具”论，采用高压手段压制群众意见。广大革命职工想根据客观实际自己布置一项工程却根本办不到，而为了证实那些资产阶级“专家”、“权威”的所谓“论断”，却可以大开工程，不受限制，有时“专家”一句话，就浪费国家资金几万元，甚至几十万元。
    围绕走群众路线还是走“专家”路线的问题，二队革委会组织群众展开了革命大批判。大家认识到，这是关系到地质工作走哪条道路的问题，是走社会主义道路还是走资本主义道路的问题。广大职工思想觉悟大大提高，对修正主义路线无比仇恨，对毛主席革命路线无限热爱。从而，在革委会的领导下，掀起了斗、批、改的热潮。革委会采取了革命化措施，发动群众对今年的生产任务、布局进行了深入的讨论，还把过去“关禁闭”的大量地质资料解放出来，变成活资料，交给群众掌握，同时发动大家提出了许多新的矿源线索。二队的革命地质工作人员信心百倍地说：“我们革命群众掌握了地质工作的大权，只要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，地质工作不是无所作为，而是大有可为。”他们决心心怀祖国，放眼世界，为祖国的社会主义建设找一辈子矿。
    毛主席说：“在生产斗争和科学实验范围内，人类总是不断发展的，自然界也总是不断发展的，永远不会停止在一个水平上。因此，人类总得不断地总结经验，有所发现，有所发明，有所创造，有所前进。停止的论点，悲观的论点，无所作为和骄傲自满的论点，都是错误的。”第二地质队的工作人员在革委会领导下，总结了过去的经验教训，一致认为，要建设社会主义的地质事业，必须踢开“洋框框”，走自己的道路。他们遵照毛主席的教导，今年的生产安排改变了过去“单打一”找矿的倾向，合理利用矿产资源；并遵照毛主席的“备战、备荒、为人民”的指示，确定了今后地质工作的重点。工程师和技术人员改变了过去脱离实际、脱离群众的作风，到生产第一线和广大群众一起工作，既获得了第一手资料，又得到了锻炼改造。
    在地质队伍的建设问题上，两条路线的斗争表现在：是突出无产阶级政治呢？还是突出技术、业务？毛主席教导我们：“政治工作是一切经济工作的生命线。”按照毛主席革命路线建设地质队伍，就必须高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，走突出无产阶级政治的道路，建设一支革命化的地质队伍。中国赫鲁晓夫及其在地质战线的代理人，却千方百计地反对突出无产阶级政治，反对毛泽东思想，反对活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动。提倡什么“技术第一”，“业务挂帅”，鼓吹什么“生产好就是政治好”，“找到大矿什么都有了”等谬论。而且还推行什么“奖金制度”，大搞物质刺激，妄图把地质队伍引上“工作为了找矿，找矿为了拿钱”的修正主义道路。
    在革命大批判中，第二地质队的广大革命职工列举了大量事实，深刻揭露了党内一小撮走资派反对用毛泽东思想建设地质队伍的滔天罪行。
    毛主席说：“红军所以艰难奋战而不溃散，‘支部建在连上’是一个重要原因。”第二地质队革委会同志学习了毛主席的教导以后，深刻地认识到，加强基层的思想建设和组织建设，是地质队伍革命化的一个关键问题。怎样加强基层的思想建设和组织建设呢？他们首先狠抓对毛主席著作的学习，提高广大群众的阶级斗争觉悟和路线斗争觉悟。同时大力学习解放军突出无产阶级政治的经验，按部队连队建制的办法建设基层组织。每个分队设分队长、政治指导员，还有革命群众代表参加，组成基层领导班子。经过一个时期的实践证明，用毛泽东思想狠抓基层建设，地质队伍的革命性、科学性和组织纪律性大大加强了。
