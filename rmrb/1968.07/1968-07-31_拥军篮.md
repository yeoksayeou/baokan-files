An old peasant woman who suffered greatly in her life deeply loves the People's Liberation Army, who are carrying out the "Three Supports, Two Militaries" tasks. To express her feelings, she specially sent an old begging basket, which she used in the old society, to the Sixth Platoon of a certain unit, so that the soldiers would never forget the bitterness of their class and always maintain high fighting spirit.

In the honor room of the Sixth Platoon of a certain unit on the front line of the South China Sea, there is a noticeable "Support the Army Basket." The basket is already very old and has a large hole in it. Inside the basket, there are no southern fruits or the gifts commonly given by poor and lower-middle peasants—eggs. Instead, it contains fifteen kinds of wild vegetables that poor people often ate in the old society, such as bitter vegetables, wild yams, banana stems, and hemp leaves, as well as a patched and mended piece of homespun cloth. This basket originally belonged to Fang Luo, a 64-year-old old peasant woman from the Daba Production Brigade of the Daba Commune in Puning County. Fang Luo sent it as the most precious gift to support the army to the officers and soldiers of the Sixth Platoon. The story is as follows:

In April of this year, the officers and soldiers of the Sixth Platoon, following Chairman Mao's instructions on "supporting the army and loving the people" and the great call to "support the leftist broad masses," came to the Daba Commune of the Daba Brigade to propagate Mao Zedong Thought and help the poor and lower-middle peasants in their revolutionary and productive work. The propaganda team members established revolutionary friendships with the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and did new deeds for the people.

On that day, Fang Luo heard that the Sixth Platoon had received orders from higher authorities to leave and carry out new combat missions. Her heart was unsettled for a long time. The moving deeds of the officers and soldiers of the Sixth Platoon who loved the people flooded her mind. She thought: This time, the PLA came to the village to propagate Mao Zedong Thought, braving wind and rain, and for our revolution and production, they worked until their eyes were red and their bodies were thin. I should pick the best fresh eggs I have stored at home and give them to my dear soldiers. But then she thought again: The PLA loves the people fundamentally and helps them fundamentally; we should also support the army fundamentally and care for the soldiers fundamentally. Chairman Mao teaches us: "Who are our enemies? Who are our friends? This is the primary question of the revolution." Comrade Lin Biao also said: "If you do not understand what class is, do not understand what exploitation is, you do not understand revolution." Fang Luo thought, the soldiers are mostly raised in sweet water, helping them understand the old society and recognize the new society, and raising their class consciousness is not the best way to support the army? At this time, Fang Luo remembered the begging basket she had kept for eighteen years and decided to give this begging basket as the best gift to her dear PLA.

In the old society, Fang Luo was sold as a child bride at a young age. At the age of twenty-nine, her husband died, and to make a living, she was forced to carry this begging basket, taking her three sons to beg for food everywhere. Two of her sons starved to death on the road. One day, Fang Luo went to beg for food at the door of a landlord named Fang. The cruel landlord not only refused to give her anything but also said she had ruined the "family reputation" of the Fang family. He let out a wolf dog that bit Fang Luo all over, leaving her body covered in blood. The begging basket was also bitten with a large hole, and to this day, Fang Luo still has a scar on her left hand. After liberation, Fang Luo turned over a new leaf and became the master of her own life. To never forget the Communist Party for her liberation and never forget Chairman Mao for her happiness, Fang Luo has always kept this begging basket. Every time the New Year or festival comes, Fang Luo would take out this basket to educate her family and descendants. Later, the whole family called this basket the "anti-revisionism basket."

The Sixth Platoon's officers and soldiers were about to leave, and the whole village immediately became excited. It happened that Fang Luo was sick in bed that day and could not get up, so she instructed her daughter-in-law to take this "anti-revisionism basket" along with the patched and mended old clothes she wore when begging and send them to her dear soldiers. At that time, an old man from the neighboring house heard that Fang Luo was sending the "anti-revisionism basket" to her dear soldiers and specially picked fifteen kinds of wild vegetables that Fang Luo and the poor and lower-middle peasants often ate in the old society from the mountain and put them in the basket to send to the Sixth Platoon together.

Platoon Leader Huang Hanliang took the "anti-revisionism basket" and excitedly said to everyone: "Comrades, look at this, is this food for people to eat? Clothes for people to wear? But in the old society, Fang Luo's family lived on such wild vegetables for decades, wearing such ragged clothes to survive the winter. However, the great scoundrel Khrushchev of China still talks nonsense about 'exploitation is meritorious' and that the poor and lower-middle peasants 'welcome exploitation.' This is all a pack of lies! We must overthrow the Kuomintang reactionaries! Overthrow the Khrushchev of China! Follow Chairman Mao and carry the revolution through to the end!"

From then on, the Sixth Platoon called this basket the "Support the Army Basket." Wherever they went, they brought it with them and often used it to educate the officers and soldiers to never forget the bitterness of their class and to remember the blood debt; to use this basket to fiercely criticize the "exploitation is meritorious" theory of the Khrushchev of China, to arouse the officers and soldiers' deep hatred for the old society and the Khrushchev of China, and to ignite their boundless class feelings of love for the great leader Chairman Mao.

    “拥军篮”
    一个受苦很深的贫农老大娘，无限热爱担任“三支”“两军”工作的人民解放军。为了表达自己的心意，她特意把在旧社会用的一个讨饭的篮子送给某部六连，好让战士们永远不忘阶级苦，永远保持高昂的战斗意志。
    在南海前线某部六连的荣誉室里，有一个惹人注目的“拥军篮”。篮子已经很旧了，还有一个大洞，篮子里面装的不是南方盛产的水果，也不是贫下中农常用的礼品——鸡蛋，而是穷人们在旧社会常吃的苦苦菜、野芋头、香蕉头、黄麻叶等十五种野菜和一件补钉叠补钉的土布衫。这个篮子原是普宁县大坝公社大坝大队六十四岁的老贫农方锣老大娘家里的“防修篮”，方大娘把它作为拥军的最珍贵礼品，送给六连干部和战士了。事情的经过是这样的：
    今年四月，六连干部战士遵照毛主席“拥军爱民”的指示和“人民解放军应该支持左派广大群众”的伟大号召，来到大坝公社大坝大队宣传毛泽东思想，帮助贫下中农抓革命促生产。宣传队的同志与广大贫下中农建立了革命的情谊，为人民立了新功。
    这天，方大娘听说六连接到上级指示，要离开这里去执行新的战斗任务，心里久久不能平静，六连干部战士爱民的动人事迹，一桩桩涌上心头。她想：解放军这次进村宣传毛泽东思想，风里来，雨里去，为了俺们的革命和生产，熬红了眼睛，累瘦了身体，俺应该把家里贮藏的最大最好的鲜蛋挑出来送给亲人。可是大娘转念又想：解放军爱民爱根本，帮根本；俺们拥军也要拥根本，关心战士关心根本。毛主席教导我们：“谁是我们的敌人？谁是我们的朋友？这个问题是革命的首要问题。”林副主席也说：“不懂得什么是阶级，不懂得什么是剥削，就不懂得革命。”大娘想，战士们大都是甜水里生甜水里长的，帮助他们了解旧社会，认识新社会，提高阶级觉悟，不就是最好的拥军吗？这时大娘想起保存了十八年之久的要饭篮，便决心把这个要饭篮当作最好的礼品送给亲人解放军。
    在旧社会，方大娘从小就给人家当童养媳，二十九岁死了丈夫，为了生活，她被迫提起了这个要饭篮，带着三个儿子到处要饭，两个儿子活活被饿死在路上。有一天，方大娘到一家姓方的地主门前要饭，狠毒的地主不但不给，反说她败坏了方家的“家风”，放出狼狗把方大娘咬得遍身血淋淋，把方大娘的要饭篮子咬了一个大洞，至今方大娘左手上还留下一块伤痕。解放后，方大娘翻了身，当了主人，为了翻身不忘共产党，幸福不忘毛主席，大娘一直把这个要饭篮保留下来，每逢过年过节，大娘就拿出这个篮子教育全家教育后代。后来全家就把这个篮子叫作“防修篮”。
    六连的干部战士就要走了，整个村子立刻沸腾起来。正巧那天大娘生了病，不能起床，她就吩咐儿媳妇把这个“防修篮”连同她要饭时穿的一件补钉加补钉的破衫送给亲人。这时，隔壁的一位老大爷听说大娘要送“防修篮”给亲人，又特意从山上摘来大娘和贫下中农们在旧社会常吃的十五种野菜放在篮子里，一同送给六连。
    连长黄汉良接过“防修篮”，激动地对大家说：“同志们，你看这那里是人吃的食？人穿的衣？可是在旧社会，方大娘一家几十年就是吃这样的野菜过活，穿这样的破衣过冬。然而中国赫鲁晓夫这个大坏蛋还胡说什么‘剥削有功’，贫下中农‘欢迎剥削’，这完全是骗人的鬼话！我们一定要打倒国民党反动派！打倒中国赫鲁晓夫！跟着毛主席把革命进行到底！”
    从此，六连就把这个篮子称为“拥军篮”，走到哪就把它带到哪，经常用来教育干部战士不忘阶级苦，牢记血泪仇；用这个篮子狠批中国赫鲁晓夫的“剥削有功”论，激发干部战士对旧社会、对中国赫鲁晓夫的刻骨仇恨，焕发对伟大领袖毛主席的无限热爱的阶级感情。
