The great leader Chairman Mao recently instructed us: “Whether to protect or suppress the broad masses of the people is the fundamental difference between the Communist Party and the Kuomintang, the fundamental difference between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, and the fundamental difference between proletarian dictatorship and bourgeois dictatorship.” Studying Chairman Mao’s brilliant directive, we have come to understand that the most fundamental duty of the proletarian dictatorship is to lead the masses in striking down a handful of diehard class enemies and resolutely suppressing them. This is the greatest protection of the fundamental interests of the broad revolutionary masses and is loyalty to Chairman Mao’s revolutionary line.

The state is a tool of class struggle and violence, serving a particular class. The state of all exploiting classes is fundamentally opposed to the interests of the broad masses of the people and is used to suppress the broad masses of the people. The proletarian state represents the fundamental interests of the proletariat and the broad masses of the people and is used to protect the proletariat and the broad masses of the people.

How does the proletarian state protect the people? The most important thing is to resolutely suppress the enemy and implement dictatorship over a handful of class enemies. If this is not done, the class enemies will engage in sabotage, create chaos, and even attempt a counterrevolution, achieving a capitalist restoration and turning around to suppress our state power. The practice of class struggle has proven this. Take Qingdao Match Factory as an example. A handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, following the counterrevolutionary intentions of China’s Khrushchev to surrender and capitulate, promoted feudal foremen and counterrevolutionary elements, allowing a handful of bad elements to persecute the masses at will. At the beginning of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, this handful of class enemies, in order to save their doomed fate, distorted right and wrong, “surrounded” the revolutionary faction, implemented white terror, and implemented dictatorship over the broad revolutionary masses. This is intolerable! We followed Chairman Mao’s instruction to “support the leftist broad masses of the people” and resolutely supported the leftist broad masses of the people, smashing the counterrevolutionary dictatorship of the class enemies and ensuring the victory of the Cultural Revolution in the factory.

Chairman Mao said: “Against the enemy, we must be ruthless, we must subdue him, we must annihilate him….” After the revolutionary committee of the factory was established, following Chairman Mao’s strategic deployment, we armed the broad revolutionary masses with Mao Zedong Thought, launched a sustained attack on the class enemies, and struck the enemy steadily, accurately, and ruthlessly. We exposed the counterrevolutionary clique composed of unrepentant capitalist-roaders within the factory and other counterrevolutionary elements, and dug out the spies and counterrevolutionary elements who had been hiding for a long time. We smashed the rightist wind of reversing correct verdicts they had stirred up. We also, in conjunction with the class struggle situation in the factory, organized the broad masses of workers to carry out a thorough revolutionary criticism, raised the broad masses’ awareness of the struggle between the two lines, and continuously achieved new victories in grasping revolution and promoting production.

The experience of struggle tells us that only by being ruthless to the enemy can we be close to the people; only by striking down the class enemies can we protect the people and protect the proletarian dictatorship; only by thoroughly exposing the counterrevolutionary plots of the class enemies can we awaken the people’s consciousness, unite the broad revolutionary masses, and consolidate the proletarian dictatorship. Being lenient to the enemy is being cruel to the people and is a great betrayal of the fundamental interests of the people. Therefore, the primary important task of the revolutionary committee is to continuously arm the broad revolutionary masses with Mao Zedong Thought, grasp class struggle, and strike down a handful of class enemies. We are determined to follow Chairman Mao’s instructions and, in the struggle, build the revolutionary committee into a powerful combat command center that is infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao’s proletarian revolutionary line, resolutely suppresses the class enemies, and protects the people.

    狠狠打击一小撮阶级敌人就是对人民群众的最大保护
    青岛市火柴厂革委会常委、解放军代表　金银如
    伟大领袖毛主席最近教导我们：“对广大人民群众是保护还是镇压，是共产党同国民党的根本区别，是无产阶级同资产阶级的根本区别，是无产阶级专政同资产阶级专政的根本区别。”学习毛主席这一光辉的指示，我们认识到，无产阶级政权最基本的职责就是带领群众对一小撮顽固不化的阶级敌人狠狠打击，坚决镇压。这是对广大革命人民群众根本利益的最大保护，就是对毛主席革命路线的忠诚。
    政权是阶级斗争的暴力工具，是为一定的阶级服务的。一切剥削阶级的政权，同广大人民群众的根本利益是相对立的，都是镇压广大人民群众的。无产阶级的政权，代表着无产阶级和广大人民群众的根本利益，是保护无产阶级和广大人民群众的。
    无产阶级政权怎样保护人民呢？最主要的就是要坚决地镇压敌人，向一小撮阶级敌人实行专政。不这样做，阶级敌人就要进行破坏、捣乱，甚至变天，实现资本主义复辟，反过来专我们的政。阶级斗争的实践证明了这一点。就拿青岛火柴厂来说吧，党内一小撮走资派秉承中国赫鲁晓夫的招降纳叛的反革命意旨，重用封建把头、反革命分子，让一小撮坏人肆意迫害群众。在无产阶级文化大革命初期，这一小撮阶级敌人为了挽救他们灭亡的命运，颠倒黑白，“围剿”革命派，实行白色恐怖，对广大革命群众实行专政。是可忍，孰不可忍！我们遵照毛主席
  “人民解放军应该支持左派广大群众”的教导，坚决地支持左派广大群众，粉碎了阶级敌人的反革命专政，保证了厂里文化大革命的胜利进行。
    毛主席说：“对敌人要狠，要压倒它，要消灭它……。”厂革命委员会诞生后，紧跟毛主席的战略部署，用毛泽东思想武装广大革命群众，向阶级敌人发动持续的进攻，稳、准、狠地打击了敌人，揪出了由厂内死不悔改的走资派和其他反革命分子等组成的反革命小集团，挖出了暗藏很久很深的特务、反革命分子，粉碎了他们刮起的右倾翻案妖风。我们还结合厂里阶级斗争的形势，组织广大职工，深入地开展革命大批判，提高了广大群众的两条路线斗争觉悟，不断取得抓革命促生产的新胜利。
    斗争经验告诉我们，只有对敌人狠，才能对人民群众亲；只有狠狠打击阶级敌人，才能保护群众，保护无产阶级政权；只有彻底揭露阶级敌人的反革命阴谋，才能唤醒人民的觉悟，团结广大革命群众，巩固无产阶级专政。对敌人仁慈，就是对人民群众的残忍，就是对人民群众根本利益的最大背叛。因此，革命委员会的头等重要任务，就是不断用毛泽东思想武装广大革命群众，狠抓阶级斗争，狠狠打击一小撮阶级敌人。我们决心遵照毛主席的教导，在斗争中把革命委员会建设成为无限忠于毛主席无产阶级革命路线、坚决镇压阶级敌人、保护人民群众的强有力的战斗指挥部。
