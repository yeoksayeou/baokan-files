Recently, I watched the revolutionary modern Beijing opera "Sha Jianhu," and I loved it. I love this play because it embodies the great leader Chairman Mao's thought of seizing power through armed struggle, and it praises the heroes of workers, peasants, and soldiers who are armed with Mao Zedong Thought. Watching this play makes us love Chairman Mao even more and love Mao Zedong Thought even more. We will definitely follow Chairman Mao's teachings, firmly grasp the gun, and carry the revolution through to the end.

From the beginning of the play, we see the people's army—the New Fourth Army—stationed in Sha Jianhu, where the reeds on the Yangcheng Lake and the willows along the shore create a beautiful scene, and the Jiangnan region of fish and rice truly becomes the land of the poor and lower-middle peasants. However, when the counterrevolutionary armed forces of Hu Chuanji arrive, the people of Sha Jianhu fall into deep suffering. This fact once again proves Chairman Mao's teaching: "Without a people's army, the people have nothing." "Power comes from the barrel of a gun" is a great truth. Chairman Mao also teaches us: "The working class and the laboring masses can only defeat the armed bourgeoisie and landlords with the force of the gun; in this sense, we can say that the whole world can only be transformed with the gun." The military and civilians of Sha Jianhu, remembering Chairman Mao's teachings, firmly grasp the revolutionary gun, engage in arduous armed struggle, and finally, in the face of a strong enemy, defeat the cunning and stubborn enemy, liberating Sha Jianhu. Linking this to our commune's situation, it is the same. The poor and lower-middle peasants in our commune all know that without armed struggle, there is no revolutionary victory; without the gun, there is nothing for the poor and lower-middle peasants. In the old society, we suffered a thousand hardships, all because we had no power and no gun. Taking myself as an example, from the time I can remember, our whole family worked as long-term laborers for the landlords. We worked every day and went hungry every day; we planted and harvested every year and suffered cold every year. Throughout the year, we never had a full meal or wore new clothes. Fortunately, Chairman Mao established an army for us and taught us to pick up the gun, forming a strong militia. Under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party, we fought against the landlords, distributed land, suppressed counterrevolutionaries, and eliminated the landlord armed restoration corps. We also actively cooperated with the PLA in combat, drove out Japanese imperialism, and overthrew the reactionary rule of Chiang Kai-shek, establishing the proletarian dictatorship.

Seizing power relies on the gun, and defending and consolidating power also relies on the gun. We poor and lower-middle peasants resolutely follow Chairman Mao's teaching to "establish a militia corps," holding a hoe in one hand to build socialism and a gun in the other to defend our proletarian red power. During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, our commune's militia, with the help of the "supporting agriculture" PLA, took the lead in rebelling against the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, seizing their power, and deeply and persistently carrying out revolutionary criticism. Together with the People's Liberation Army, we firmly grasp the gun, defend the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and defend the newly established revolutionary committees. The gun is truly our poor and lower-middle peasants' backbone!

The Chinese Khrushchev frantically opposes the great leader Chairman Mao's teaching that "power comes from the barrel of a gun," peddling the black goods of capitulationism, advocating "legal struggle" and the "parliamentary road," attempting to make the revolutionary people put down their guns to engage in "class cooperation" with the enemy, making the laboring people once again become slaves to the landlords and capitalists. The revolutionary modern Beijing opera "Sha Jianhu" is a powerful refutation of the Chinese Khrushchev's capitulationism. This refutation is excellent, excellent! Watching it is truly satisfying! We poor and lower-middle peasants and militia fighters love to watch "Sha Jianhu" and love to watch revolutionary model operas.

    枪杆子里面出政权
    北京市海淀区东北旺公社民兵营长　刘云桂
    最近看了革命现代京剧《沙家浜》，非常喜爱。俺喜爱这出戏，是因为它体现了伟大领袖毛主席的武装夺取政权的思想，歌颂了用毛泽东思想武装起来的工农兵英雄人物。看了这出戏，使我们更加热爱毛主席，更加热爱毛泽东思想。我们一定遵循毛主席的教导，紧握枪杆子，把革命进行到底。
    这出戏一开始，就看到人民的子弟兵——新四军进驻沙家浜后，阳澄湖上“芦花放稻谷香岸柳成行”，江南鱼米乡真正成了咱贫下中农的天下。可是，反革命武装胡传葵的军队一来，沙家浜的群众就陷入水深火热之中。这个事实再次证明了毛主席的教导：“没有一个人民的军队，便没有人民的一切”“枪杆子里面出政权”是伟大的真理。毛主席还教导我们：“工人阶级和劳动群众，只有用枪杆子的力量才能战胜武装的资产阶级和地主；在这个意义上，我们可以说，整个世界只有用枪杆子才可能改造。”沙家浜的军民，正是牢记毛主席的这一教导，紧紧握住革命的枪杆子，进行艰苦的武装斗争，终于在敌强我弱的形势下，战胜了狡猾顽固的敌人，解放了沙家浜。联系到我们公社的情况，也是一个样。我们公社的贫下中农都知道，没有武装斗争就没有革命的胜利；没有枪杆子就没有贫下中农的一切。旧社会咱千苦万苦，就苦在没有政权，没有枪杆子上。拿我自己来说，从我刚记事起，我们全家给地主扛活做长工。我们天天干活，天天挨饿；年年收种，年年受冻。一年到头没吃过一顿饱饭，没穿过一件新衣。多亏了毛主席给我们建立了一支人民自己的军队，并教育我们拿起枪杆子，组成坚强的民兵队伍。在毛主席、共产党的领导下，我们斗地主，分田地，镇压反革命，消灭了地主武装还乡团。我们还积极配合解放军作战，赶走了日本帝国主义，推翻了蒋介石的反动统治，建立了无产阶级的政权。
    夺取政权靠枪杆子，保卫政权、巩固政权还要靠枪杆子。我们贫下中农坚决遵照毛主席“大办民兵师”的教导，一手拿锄，建设社会主义；一手拿枪，保卫我们无产阶级的红色政权。在无产阶级文化大革命中，我们公社的民兵在“支农”解放军的帮助下，带头造了党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的反，夺了他们的权，并深入持久地开展革命大批判。我们和人民解放军一起，紧握枪杆子，保卫无产阶级文化大革命，保卫新生的革命委员会。枪杆子真是我们贫下中农的靠山！
    中国赫鲁晓夫拚命反对伟大领袖毛主席“枪杆子里面出政权”的教导，大肆贩卖投降主义的黑货，鼓吹什么“合法斗争”“议会道路”，妄图使革命人民放下枪杆子去和敌人搞“阶级合作”，使劳动人民重新给地主、资本家当牛马。革命现代京剧《沙家浜》就是对中国赫鲁晓夫的投降主义最有力的回击。这一击，好得很，好极了！看了真是解气！我们贫下中农、民兵战士就是爱看《沙家浜》，就是爱看革命样板戏。
