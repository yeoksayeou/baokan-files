	Singing Praises of Our Beloved People's Liberation Army
	Guo Hongbing

	The swallows from the south and the winds from the north,
	The mountain songs sung for the People's Liberation Army to hear.
	The bonfires of Jinggangshan and the lights of Tiananmen,
	Illuminate the revolutionary journey of ten thousand miles!

	Forty-one years of wind and rain,
	The People's Liberation Army follows Chairman Mao closely.
	Through countless trials and tribulations, they remain loyal,
	The hearts of the People's Liberation Army are red and shining.

	Chairman Mao's teachings are the truth,
	"Political power grows out of the barrel of a gun."
	The sun in the sky and the sunflowers on the ground,
	The People's Liberation Army listens to Chairman Mao's words!

	Through wind and thunder, their hearts remain unchanged,
	They are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line!

	The great commander waves his mighty hand,
	Hundreds of millions of soldiers and civilians follow Chairman Mao!

	The Cultural Revolution is in full swing,
	"Three Supports, Two Militaries" sing songs of victory!
	The songs of the Baqing Grasslands and the waters of the Gan River,
	Heroic flowers bloom beautifully...

	The sea relies on the mountains, and the mountains rely on the sea,
	Firmly support the revolutionary faction of the proletariat!

	The latest directives are spoken word by word,
	Every word and sentence illuminates our hearts!

	The army loves the people, and the people support the army,
	The bond between the army and the people is as deep as fish and water.
	With one heart, we build an iron wall,
	The army and the people are united as one.

	Shoulder to shoulder, we criticize the Chinese Khrushchev,
	Forever follow the path guided by Chairman Mao!

	Red flags fly high in the south and north,
	Our beloved ones help us set up study classes...

	"Grasp the revolution, promote production" —
	Victories are reported from the south and north of the Yangtze River!
	The revolutionary three-in-one combination is more solid,
	Our beloved People's Liberation Army is the pillar!

	The stars in the sky and the lights on the ground,
	The merits of our beloved ones are countless.

	Chairman Mao's teachings are engraved in our hearts,
	Learn from the good example of the People's Liberation Army.
	Mao Zedong Thought is the soul,
	With "loyalty" in our hearts, the sun and moon are renewed.

	Fish love water, swallows love spring,
	We will forever believe in the People's Liberation Army!

	Houses rely on beams, trees rely on roots,
	We firmly rely on the People's Liberation Army!

	Ten thousand good things cannot compare to the People's Liberation Army,
	Father and mother are dear, but Chairman Mao is dearer.

	Ten thousand songs and melodies merge into one sound:
	Long live Chairman Mao! Long live the People's Liberation Army!

    歌唱亲人解放军
    郭红兵南来的燕子北去的风，山歌儿唱给解放军听。井冈山的篝火天安门的灯，照耀着革命万里程！四十一载风和雨，解放军紧跟毛主席。千锤百炼一个“忠”，解放军的心啊向阳红。毛主席的教导是真理，“枪杆子里面出政权”。天上的红日地上的葵花，解放军最听毛主席的话！风吹雷打心不变，无限忠于毛主席的革命路线！伟大的统帅挥巨手，亿万军民跟着毛主席走！文化大革命如荼如火，“三支”“两军”奏凯歌！巴仓草原的歌啊赣江的水，英雄花开朵朵美……海靠山来山靠海，坚决支持无产阶级革命派！最新指示一字一句地讲，字字句句照亮咱心坎！军爱民啊民拥军，军民情谊鱼水深。同心共筑钢铁长城，军民团结亲如一人。并肩批判中国赫鲁晓夫，永远走毛主席指引的路！山南海北红旗展，亲人帮咱办起学习班……“抓革命，促生产”大江南北捷报传！革命三结合更巩固，亲人解放军是支柱！天上的星星地上的灯，亲人的功绩数不清。毛主席教导记心上，学习解放军好榜样。毛泽东思想化灵魂，胸怀“忠”字日月新。鱼爱水啊燕爱春，咱永远相信解放军！屋靠梁啊树靠根，咱坚决依靠解放军！千好万好没有解放军好，爹亲娘亲没有毛主席亲。千歌万曲化成一个音：万岁万岁毛主席，万岁万岁解放军！
