In the midst of the triumphant songs of victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, at this crucial moment of struggle between the two classes, the two lines, and the two roads, our most beloved and respected great leader Chairman Mao has issued a new battle cry to us: "Universities should still be run, and I am mainly talking about universities of science and engineering. However, the system should be shortened, education should be revolutionized, proletarian politics should be in command, and the path of Shanghai Machine Tool Factory in training technical personnel from among workers should be followed. Students should be selected from among workers and peasants with practical experience, and after studying in school for a few years, they should return to production practice."

Chairman Mao's latest instructions have greatly boosted the morale of the working class and greatly strengthened our resolve and confidence to carry the proletarian education revolution through to the end. Chairman Mao cares for, trusts, and relies on us workers and peasants the most; we workers will resolutely carry out Chairman Mao's instructions, word for word. We wish Chairman Mao a long, long life! A long, long life!

For a long time, there have been two lines of struggle in the field of education. One is Chairman Mao's proletarian education line, and the other is the counter-revolutionary revisionist education line pushed by the Chinese Khrushchev. The former is "education must serve proletarian politics and must be combined with productive labor," cultivating "laborers who are both socially conscious and cultured." The latter is education detached from proletarian politics, detached from the workers and peasants, detached from production practice, cultivating revisionist seedlings who are driven by personal gain and prioritize technology. In the struggle between these two lines, which line to follow is a major issue concerning whether the proletarian dictatorship can be consolidated and whether the socialist state will change color. We proletarian revolutionaries must implement Chairman Mao's proletarian education line, carry the education revolution through to the end, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

I am a technician who grew up from an ordinary worker under the cultivation and education of Chairman Mao and the Party, and now I serve as a deputy chief engineer. From my practical experience, I deeply feel that Chairman Mao's teaching that "reading is learning, using is also learning, and it is even more important learning" is extremely wise and great. Knowledge comes from practice. Over the years, under the brilliant illumination of Mao Zedong Thought and with the help of my comrades, I have summarized experiences and lessons from practice, continuously learned and improved in practice. So far, I have not only mastered the practical operation skills of multiple trades such as lathe, milling, welding, and electrical work, but also carried out some technological innovations, designed some new products, and successively invented and created thirteen kinds of special equipment, including bonding machines, cutting molds, coil machines, and gluing machines. At the same time, I have written some technical papers. The layer press circle milling machine was originally designed by the Soviet revisionists. This machine was bulky and clumsy, difficult to operate, and had low work efficiency, seriously affecting production. Workers armed with Mao Zedong Thought have the strongest sense of ownership and the most creative spirit. They are determined to solve this old problem. We regarded breaking through this technical difficulty as a major event to boost the morale of the Chinese people and to suppress the arrogance of the imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries. At that time, we lacked materials and equipment. Relying on our unlimited loyalty to Chairman Mao and our practical experience, we learned while doing and did while learning, and finally successfully created a new type of layer press circle milling machine. Its volume is only one-fourth of the Soviet revisionists', but its work efficiency is several times higher.

For example, the successful rolling of the electric fusion type sleeve also fully illustrates that "the most intelligent and the most talented are the soldiers with the most practical experience." At that time, in order to produce this product, the factory specially invited an "expert" from outside who had studied abroad. As soon as this person entered the factory, he put forward a set of foreign schemes. We workers opposed his approach. However, under the protection of the bourgeois reactionary line of "experts running the factory" advocated by the Chinese Khrushchev, he put on an air of "authority" and proudly said: "This is the German method, this is the American method, this is the British method, this is the Soviet method. These methods are science, and they must be strictly followed." However, after more than a month, a large amount of money was spent, but nothing was achieved. Later, we workers discarded the foreign methods and, relying on our unlimited loyalty to Chairman Mao and our practical experience, used only five or six days to successfully roll the sleeves using local methods.

Looking back at the changes in the factory's technical team over the past decade and my own growth, I deeply realize that the reason why technicians of worker origin grow fast and contribute greatly is that they have deep proletarian feelings for Chairman Mao and the Party, that they have the revolutionary spirit of not seeking fame or personal gain and daring to compete with the imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries, and that they have the scientific attitude of not being detached from reality, daring to practice, and being good at exploring the laws of development of things in practice. However, some of the technicians who graduated from colleges and universities after receiving seventeen or eighteen years of school education have, due to the shackles of personal fame and gain, the restrictions of foreign rules and frameworks, and the poisoning of the revisionist education line, become detached from the workers and peasants and from production practice, and thus cannot achieve outstanding results in scientific research.

The above facts make me realize the urgency and importance of the education revolution. According to Chairman Mao's latest instructions, carrying out the proletarian education revolution is an urgent matter. Chairman Mao's latest instructions have also pointed out the direction for us to further carry out the education revolution. We firmly believe that with Chairman Mao's support and the great Mao Zedong Thought as our guide, we will surely be able to carry the proletarian education revolution through to the end.

    坚决把无产阶级教育革命进行到底
    辽宁省革命委员会副主任　王凤恩
    在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的凯歌声中，在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争的关键时刻，我们最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席，向我们发出了新的战斗号令：“大学还是要办的，我这里主要说的是理工科大学还要办，但学制要缩短，教育要革命，要无产阶级政治挂帅，走上海机床厂从工人中培养技术人员的道路。要从有实践经验的工人农民中间选拔学生，到学校学几年以后，又回到生产实践中去。”毛主席这一最新指示，大长了我们工人阶级的志气，大大地增强了我们将无产阶级教育革命进行到底的决心和信心。毛主席最关心、最相信、最依靠我们工人农民；我们工人阶级对毛主席他老人家的指示，坚决执行，句句照办。我们千遍万遍敬祝毛主席万寿无疆！万寿无疆！
　  长期以来，在教育事业方面，一直存在着两条路线的斗争。一条是毛主席的无产阶级教育路线，另一条是中国赫鲁晓夫推行的反革命修正主义教育路线。前者是“教育必须为无产阶级政治服务，必须同生产劳动相结合”，培养“有社会主义觉悟的有文化的劳动者”。后者是教育脱离无产阶级政治，脱离工农群众，脱离生产实践，培养名利挂帅、技术第一的修正主义苗子。在这两条路线的斗争中，执行哪一条路线，是关系到无产阶级政权能不能巩固，社会主义江山变不变颜色的大问题。我们无产阶级革命派一定要贯彻执行毛主席的无产阶级教育路线，把教育革命进行到底，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    我是在毛主席和党的培养教育下，由一名普通工人成长起来的技术人员，现在担任了副总工程师。我从实践中深深感到，毛主席“读书是学习，使用也是学习，而且是更重要的学习”的教导，非常英明，非常伟大。知识来源于实践。几年来，我在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，在同志们的帮助下，从实践中总结经验教训，在实践中不断学习，不断提高，至今，我不仅掌握了车、钳、焊、铣、电等多工种的实际操作技能，而且搞了一些技术革新，设计了一些新产品，先后创造发明粘合机、切割胎具、卷管机、上胶机等十三种专用设备，同时写了一些技术论文。层压圈铣床，过去是苏修设计的。这个机器又笨又大，操作费力，工效很低，严重影响生产。用毛泽东思想武装起来的工人，最富有主人翁的责任感，最富有创造精神，决心把这个老大难的问题拿下来。我们把突破这一技术难关，看做是长中国人民的志气，灭帝修反的威风的大事情。当时，一缺资料，二缺设备。我们就是凭着对毛主席的无限忠诚，凭着自己的实践经验，在干中学，学中干，终于创造成功了新型的层压圈铣床。它的体积只有苏修的层压圈铣床的四分之一，工效却比苏修的大几倍。
    再比如，电熔式套管的卷制成功，也充分说明了“最聪明、最有才能的，是最有实践经验的战士”。当时，为了搞这个产品，厂里专门从外地请来了一个在外国学习过的“专家”。这个人刚一进厂，就摆出了一套洋方案。我们工人反对他的作法。但是，在中国赫鲁晓夫的“专家治厂”的资产阶级反动路线的庇护下，他摆出一副“权威”的架子，洋洋自得地说：“这是德国的办法，这是美国的办法，这是英国的办法，这是苏联的办法。这些办法就是科学，只能规规矩矩地照人家的去办。”可是，一个多月过去了，大量的钱花掉了，却一事无成。后来，我们工人甩开洋办法，凭着我们对毛主席的无限忠诚和实践经验，只用了五六天时间，就用土办法卷制成功。
    回顾十几年来自己成长的道路和全厂技术队伍变化的情况，我深刻地认识到，工人出身的技术人员之所以成长快，贡献大，就是因为他们对毛主席，对党有深厚的无产阶级感情，就是因为他们有一不为名，二不为利，有敢于同帝修反争高低的革命精神，就是因为他们有不脱离实际，勇于实践、善于在实践中探索事物发展规律的科学态度。而那些受了十七八年学校教育的大专院校毕业的技术人员，有些人由于受个人名利的精神枷锁的束缚，由于受洋条条洋框框的限制，由于受修正主义教育路线的毒害，脱离工农群众，脱离生产实践，在科学研究方面就做不出突出的成绩。
    上述种种事实，使我认识到教育革命的迫切性和重要性。按照毛主席的最新指示，进行无产阶级教育革命，已经是刻不容缓的一件大事，毛主席的最新指示，又为我们进一步指明了教育革命的方向，我们坚信，有毛主席他老人家撑腰，有伟大的毛泽东思想指引，我们一定能够胜利地把无产阶级教育革命进行到底。
