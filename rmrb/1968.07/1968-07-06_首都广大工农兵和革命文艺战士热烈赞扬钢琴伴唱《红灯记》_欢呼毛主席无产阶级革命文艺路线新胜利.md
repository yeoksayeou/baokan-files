The piano-accompanied singing of "The Red Lantern," nurtured and guided by Comrade Jiang Qing, has once again demonstrated to the revolutionary people of the whole country and the world the brilliant achievements of China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. It has greatly boosted the morale of the revolutionary people and struck a heavy blow to the arrogance of the imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries. It has also provided a powerful weapon for criticizing and striking down the counter-revolutionary revisionist line in literature and art pushed by the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents.

Xinhua News Agency, July 5th: The broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers in the capital, who are striving for a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, have warmly hailed the birth of a new form of proletarian revolutionary art—the piano-accompanied singing of "The Red Lantern." They highly praise this flower, which shines with the brilliant light of Mao Zedong Thought, nurtured and guided by Comrade Jiang Qing. They enthusiastically hail it as another achievement of Chairman Mao's great thought on literature and art serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and on making the past serve the present and foreign things serve China. It is a new victory for Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line in literature and art!

The broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, and revolutionary artists point out that bringing the piano onto the Peking opera stage and successfully creating the piano-accompanied singing of "The Red Lantern" has given the piano, a Western instrument, a new life in serving proletarian politics. This not only opens up a new path for Western instruments and symphonies but also opens up a new path for the accompaniment of our great motherland's dramas. After the eight model revolutionary operas appeared on the eastern horizon, this new song of Mao Zedong Thought has once again demonstrated to the revolutionary people of the whole country and the world the brilliant achievements of China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. It has greatly boosted the morale of the revolutionary people and struck a heavy blow to the arrogance of the imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries. It has also provided a powerful weapon for criticizing and striking down the counter-revolutionary revisionist line in literature and art pushed by the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents.

In recent days, the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, and revolutionary artists have gathered around radios and televisions to listen to and watch the live broadcast of the piano-accompanied singing of "The Red Lantern." Many people, during the gaps in their revolutionary and productive work, have listened to it again and again, finding it more and more enjoyable and exciting. Many units, at the urgent request of the masses, have recorded the live broadcast from the radio to meet everyone's listening needs. In recent days, although the radio stations have been repeatedly broadcasting the live performance of the piano-accompanied singing of "The Red Lantern," the broad audience has still been writing letters, requesting an increase in broadcast time. Many people have enthusiastically written letters and articles to newspapers, sharing their education and inspiration after listening to this new form of proletarian revolutionary art. From cities to villages, from offices to schools, from shops to the stations of the People's Liberation Army, everywhere you can hear the praise, "The piano-accompanied singing of 'The Red Lantern' is excellent!"

The broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, and revolutionary artists excitedly say: The piano-accompanied singing of "The Red Lantern" is a great innovation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, a great innovation in the history of world art. It is, like the eight brilliant pearls—the model revolutionary operas, an unprecedented and the best artistic work. The piano-accompanied singing of "The Red Lantern" is excellent in every way, ultimately because it fully demonstrates the great power of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line in literature and art, and it fully demonstrates the brilliant light of Mao Zedong Thought! Some representatives attending the Second Conference of Excellent Units of the Navy, at the art evening held by the Central Cultural Revolution Group to celebrate the 47th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China, happily watched and listened to the piano-accompanied singing of "The Red Lantern" with the great leader Chairman Mao. Their hearts were filled with immense excitement. The brilliant light of the red sun illuminated the stage, making it exceptionally bright. A beautiful flower of proletarian revolutionary new art was blooming. This scene made them deeply feel that "Navigating the vast ocean relies on the helmsman, and revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought" is a great truth, and they more concretely saw the immense power of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line in literature and art. The broad masses of workers and peasants in places like Beijing Coal Mine Bureau's Mucity Coal Mine and Huangtugang People's Commune, while listening to the piano-accompanied singing of "The Red Lantern," felt the same way as when they watched and listened to the eight model revolutionary operas in the past. They praised, "This is the good art that Chairman Mao has brought to us workers and peasants." National agricultural labor model and director of the Huangtugang People's Commune Revolutionary Committee, Yin Weichen, and some poor and lower-middle peasants said, "In the past, a music troupe from the city brought many Western instruments to the commune to perform, but those strange tunes, we just couldn't understand. Before the performance was over, half the people had left. Such 'high-level art,' we poor and lower-middle peasants just don't like it and don't want to listen to it. This time, listening to the piano-accompanied singing of 'The Red Lantern' is completely different. We understand it right away, the more we listen, the more exciting it is, the more we love it. It's as if the heroes Li Yuhe and Li Tiemei are standing right in front of us, fighting with us, making us feel stronger all over. Such revolutionary art, we see it with our eyes, and it brings joy to our hearts. We feel from the bottom of our hearts that Chairman Mao is wise and great. It is under the leadership of Chairman Mao that we, the broad masses of workers and peasants, and revolutionary artists, have driven all the emperors, generals, scholars, and beauties off the stage; it is under the leadership of Chairman Mao that the revolutionary artists have created eight model revolutionary operas shining with the brilliant light of Mao Zedong Thought, making us workers and peasants occupy the stage; it is under the leadership of Chairman Mao that our own piano-accompanied singing of 'The Red Lantern' shines brightly on the socialist art stage! We must shout a thousand times and ten thousand times: Long live the victory of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line in literature and art! Long live, long live, and ten thousand times long live the great leader Chairman Mao!"

"Our literature and art are for the people. They are first for the workers, peasants, and soldiers, created for the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and used by the workers, peasants, and soldiers." The broad masses of workers and peasants, while watching and listening to the piano-accompanied singing of "The Red Lantern," reviewed Chairman Mao's great teachings and felt especially close to them. They said, the piano-accompanied singing of "The Red Lantern" is a program that fully serves us workers and peasants, created according to Chairman Mao's teachings. Some revolutionary workers of the Beijing New China Printing Plant said, listening to the piano-accompanied singing of "The Red Lantern" is like seeing Li Yuhe, with his brave and heroic spirit, facing the brutal enemy with "a body full of courage and a heart soaring to the sky," and like seeing Li Tiemei, inspired by the revolutionary forerunners who "all have a red and bright heart," with her firm revolutionary resolve to "be a person like this." The piano, which used to play strange tunes that people found disgusting, is now serving us workers and peasants. Some revolutionary workers of the Beijing Knitting Factory are particularly happy that the piano, a Western instrument, has taken the stage of Peking opera and become a powerful tool serving the workers and peasants. They believe that the piano has a wide range and strong expressiveness, which can better highlight and express the spiritual appearance of characters, making the emotions of the heroes in the play richer and their images taller. They took the segment "Struggle on the Execution Ground" as an example, pointing out that the piano's sound is majestic, making one feel that Li Yuhe has the momentum of a mountain pressing down on the enemy, making this intelligent and brave hero's image more perfect, more vivid, and taller in front of us.

While hailing the birth of the piano-accompanied singing of "The Red Lantern," the broad masses of workers and peasants, and revolutionary artists unanimously condemn the heinous crimes of the counter-revolutionary literary and artistic black line pushed by the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents. The head of the leading group of the Tianzhu Commune's Mazhuang Production Brigade in the Beijing suburbs, and the active learner of Chairman Mao's works, Comrade Zhou Qingsen, said, our great leader Chairman Mao has long set the correct political direction for literature and art to serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and to serve proletarian politics. However, for a long time, a small handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists in the literary and artistic circles, with the support of their black backstage boss, the Chinese Khrushchev, have been resisting and sabotaging Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line in literature and art, pushing the counter-revolutionary revisionist literary and artistic black line. They have praised the trash played on the piano in the past to the skies, openly advocating to "go Western all the way." Their evil purpose of opening the green light for feudalist, capitalist, and revisionist literature and art is to try to undermine the fighting spirit of the broad revolutionary masses and pave the way for capitalist restoration. The birth of the piano-accompanied singing of "The Red Lantern" and the eight model revolutionary operas created under the guidance of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line in literature and art are the products of the fierce struggle between Comrade Jiang Qing leading the revolutionary artists and the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents. The active learner of Chairman Mao's works and the excellent soldier Xue Junjiang, revolutionary workers of the Beijing First Machine Tool Factory, and some revolutionary youngsters of the revolutionary committees of universities and middle schools in the capital believe that the piano-accompanied singing of "The Red Lantern" is born in the struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines, and is another heavy artillery shell fired at the Chinese Khrushchev and the counter-revolutionary revisionist literary and artistic black line he pushes. They expressed their determination to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, fight side by side with Comrade Jiang Qing and the revolutionary artists, and thoroughly smash the counter-revolutionary revisionist literary and artistic black line, making Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line in literature and art bear more abundant fruits!

Many units' revolutionary artists, inspired by the new achievements of the piano-accompanied singing of "The Red Lantern," have further studied Chairman Mao's great teachings on "using foreign things to serve China and innovating," and have further strengthened their confidence in carrying out the literary and artistic revolution. Comrades Tan Yuanshou and Ma Changli of the Beijing Peking Opera Troupe, who have been following Comrade Jiang Qing's lead in the revolutionary path of Peking opera, deeply felt that from the eight model revolutionary operas to the birth of the piano-accompanied singing of "The Red Lantern," they have proven a great truth, that is, as long as we grasp Mao Zedong Thought and firmly implement Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, we can better reform and use more forms of literature and art, better serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and create various miracles. We revolutionary artists must continuously improve our class struggle and line struggle consciousness, firmly stand on the side of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line in literature and art, constantly temper our red-hearted loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, more diligently study and apply Mao Zedong Thought, reform our worldview, achieve ideological revolutionization, and become revolutionary people who perform revolutionary plays.

    首都广大工农兵和革命文艺战士热烈赞扬钢琴伴唱《红灯记》
    欢呼毛主席无产阶级革命文艺路线新胜利
    在江青同志亲自培育和指导下诞生的这朵闪耀着毛泽东思想灿烂光辉的鲜花，又一次向全中国、全世界革命人民显示了我国无产阶级文化大革命的光辉成果，大长了革命人民的志气，大灭了帝修反的威风，更有力地批判和沉重地打击了中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人所推行的反革命修正主义文艺路线
    新华社五日讯　正在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的首都广大工农兵群众和革命文艺工作者，热烈欢呼无产阶级革命文艺新品种——钢琴伴唱《红灯记》的诞生。他们高度赞扬在江青同志亲自培育和指导下诞生的这朵闪耀着毛泽东思想灿烂光辉的鲜花，热烈欢呼这是毛主席关于文艺为工农兵服务和“古为今用，洋为中用”伟大思想的又一成果，是毛主席无产阶级革命文艺路线的新胜利！
    广大工农兵群众和革命文艺工作者指出，把钢琴搬上京剧舞台，成功地创作出钢琴伴唱《红灯记》，使钢琴这一西洋乐器在为无产阶级政治服务中获得了新的生命，这不仅为西洋乐器和交响乐开辟了一条新的道路，也为我们伟大祖国的戏剧伴奏开辟了一条新的道路。继八个革命样板戏在东方地平线上出现以后奏响的这一曲毛泽东思想的新凯歌，又一次向全中国、全世界革命人民显示了我国无产阶级文化大革命的光辉成果，大长了革命人民的志气，大灭了帝修反的威风，更有力地批判和沉重地打击了中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人所推行的反革命修正主义文艺路线。
    连日来，广大工农兵群众和革命文艺工作者纷纷集聚在收音机旁，电视机下，收听和观看钢琴伴唱《红灯记》演唱的实况转播。许多人利用抓革命、促生产的空隙时间，听了一遍又一遍，越听越爱听，越听越高兴。不少单位在群众的迫切要求下，把电台的实况广播录下音来，随时满足大家收听的要求。最近几天，广播电台虽然每天都在反复播送钢琴伴唱《红灯记》的演唱实况，广大听众仍然纷纷写信，要求增加播送时间。不少人热情地给报纸写信、写文章，畅谈他们听了这一无产阶级革命文艺新品种后所受到的教育和鼓舞。从城市到农村，从机关到学校，从商店到人民解放军驻地，到处都可以听到“钢琴伴唱《红灯记》好得很”的赞扬声。
    广大工农兵群众和革命文艺工作者兴奋地说：钢琴伴唱《红灯记》，是无产阶级文化大革命中的伟大创举，是世界艺术史上的伟大创举，它和八颗艺术明珠——革命样板戏一样，是前所未有的最好的艺术作品。钢琴伴唱《红灯记》，千好万好，归根到底就好在它充分显示了毛主席无产阶级革命文艺路线的巨大威力，好在它充分显示了毛泽东思想的灿烂光辉！出席海军第二次四好连队代表大会的部分代表，在中央文革为庆祝中国共产党成立四十七周年而举办的文艺晚会上，幸福地同伟大领袖毛主席一起观看和聆听了钢琴伴唱《红灯记》，心情万分激动。红太阳的万丈光芒，把舞台照耀得格外明亮，一朵无产阶级革命新文艺的瑰丽鲜花正在开放。此情此景，使他们更深切地体会到“大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想”是伟大的真理，更具体地看到了毛主席无产阶级革命文艺路线的无比威力。北京矿务局木城涧煤矿和黄土岗人民公社等许多地方的广大工农兵群众，在收听钢琴伴唱《红灯记》的时候，同过去观看和收听八个革命样板戏一样，觉得字字句句唱到了自己的心坎上，连连称赞“这是毛主席给咱工农兵送来的好文艺”。全国农业劳动模范、黄土岗人民公社革委会主任殷维臣和一些贫下中农说，过去城里有个乐团带了好多洋乐器到公社来演出，可是那些洋腔怪调，我们怎么也听不懂，没等节目演完，人就走了一大半。这样的“高级艺术”，我们贫下中农就是不爱听，就是不要听。这次听钢琴伴唱《红灯记》可就大不一样了，我们一听就懂，越听越带劲，越听越爱听，好象英雄李玉和、李铁梅就站在我们跟前，和我们一起战斗，使我们浑身上下增添了力量。这样的革命文艺，我们看在眼里，乐在心头，打心眼里感到毛主席英明伟大。就是在毛主席领导下，我们广大工农兵和革命文艺战士才把帝王将相、才子佳人统统赶下了舞台；就是在毛主席领导下，革命文艺战士创造出八个闪烁着毛泽东思想灿烂光辉的革命样板戏，使我们工农兵占领了舞台；就是在毛主席领导下，我们工农兵自己的钢琴伴唱
  《红灯记》才在社会主义文艺舞台上大放光彩！我们要千遍万遍高呼：毛主席的无产阶级革命文艺路线胜利万岁！伟大领袖毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！
      “我们的文学艺术都是为人民大众的，首先是为工农兵的，为工农兵而创作，为工农兵所利用的。”广大工农兵群众在观看和收听钢琴伴唱《红灯记》的时候，重温毛主席这一伟大教导，感到特别亲切。他们说，钢琴伴唱《红灯记》，就是遵照毛主席的教导创作的完全为我们工农兵服务的好节目。北京新华印刷厂的一些革命职工说，听了钢琴伴唱《红灯记》，就象看到了李玉和在残暴的敌人面前“浑身是胆雄赳赳”、“雄心壮志冲云天”的革命英雄气概，就象看到了李铁梅在革命先辈“都有一颗红亮的心”的激励下“做人要做这样的人”的坚定的革命决心，就象看到了李玉和、李铁梅高擎红灯，扫妖风、战恶浪的勇往直前的大无畏的革命战斗精神。过去演奏洋腔怪调叫人一听就讨厌的钢琴，现在也为我们工农兵服务了。北京针织总厂的一些革命职工，对钢琴这一西洋乐器登上京剧舞台，成为为工农兵服务的有力工具，感到特别高兴。他们认为，钢琴音域宽广，表现力强，能够更好地烘托和表现人物的精神面貌，使戏中的英雄人物感情更加丰富，形象更加高大。他们拿“刑场斗争”一段钢琴伴唱做例子指出，钢琴音响气势磅礴，听了以后，感到李玉和对敌人有泰山压顶之势，使这个智勇双全的英雄形象更加完善、更加生动、更加高大地显现在我们面前。
    在欢呼钢琴伴唱《红灯记》胜利诞生的时候，广大工农兵群众和革命文艺工作者同声声讨中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人所推行的反革命文艺黑线的滔天罪行。北京郊区天竺公社马头庄大队领导班子负责人、学习毛主席著作积极分子周庆森同志说，我们伟大领袖毛主席，早就为文艺规定了为工农兵服务、为无产阶级政治服务的唯一正确的政治方向。可是，长期以来，盘踞在文艺界的一小撮反革命修正主义分子在他们的黑后台中国赫鲁晓夫的支持下，一直抵制和破坏毛主席的无产阶级革命文艺路线，推行反革命修正主义文艺黑线。他们把过去钢琴弹奏的那些乌七八糟的破烂货捧上了天，公然叫嚷要“洋到底”。他们为封建主义、资本主义、修正主义文艺大开绿灯的罪恶目的，就是妄图瓦解广大革命群众的斗志，为资本主义复辟鸣锣开道。钢琴伴唱《红灯记》的诞生，和在毛主席无产阶级革命文艺路线指引下创造出来的八个革命样板戏一样，是江青同志率领革命文艺工作者同中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人进行激烈斗争的产物。学习毛主席著作积极分子、五好战士薛俊江，北京第一机床厂的革命职工和首都大专院校、中等学校红代会的一些革命小将认为，钢琴伴唱《红灯记》，是在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争中诞生的，是射向中国赫鲁晓夫和他所推行的反革命修正主义文艺黑线的又一发重型炮弹。他们表示，一定要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在江青同志率领下，和革命文艺战士并肩战斗，彻底摧毁反革命修正主义文艺黑线，让毛主席的无产阶级革命文艺路线结出更丰硕的果实！
    许多单位的革命文艺战士在钢琴伴唱《红灯记》新成就的鼓舞下，进一步学习了毛主席“洋为中用、推陈出新”的伟大教导，更加增强了进行文艺革命的信心。紧跟江青同志在京剧革命道路上冲锋陷阵的北京京剧团的谭元寿、马长礼等同志深有体会地指出，从八个革命样板戏到钢琴伴唱《红灯记》的诞生，都证明了一个伟大的真理，这就是只要掌握了毛泽东思想，坚决贯彻执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，我们就能够更好地改造和利用更多的文艺形式，更好地为工农兵服务，创造出各种人间奇迹。我们革命的文艺工作者一定要不断提高阶级斗争和路线斗争觉悟，坚定不移地站在毛主席革命文艺路线一边，时刻锤炼对伟大领袖毛主席的赤胆忠心，更加努力地活学活用毛泽东思想，改造世界观，实现思想革命化，做到要演革命戏，先做革命人。
