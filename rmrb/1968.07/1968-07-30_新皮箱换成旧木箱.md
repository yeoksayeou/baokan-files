The revolutionary committee chairman of the school, Su Sheng, walked briskly back home from school. Today, he was particularly happy because his son, Su Zhaofeng, was about to embark on the path of integrating with workers and peasants as guided by Chairman Mao.

As soon as he entered the door, he saw a new leather trunk on the bed. Before he could ask, Zhaofeng eagerly said, "Dad, I bought this. Everything I need for the countryside is ready." There are old trunks at home, so why buy a new one? Su Sheng was taken aback. He thought, buying a trunk is a small matter, but it shows that Zhaofeng has not mentally prepared himself to go to the countryside. With this mindset, how can he blend in with the poor and lower-middle peasants and take root in the countryside for life!

That evening, the family Mao Zedong Thought study class began. First, they studied Chairman Mao's teaching: "Be thrifty in running factories, shops, and all state-owned and cooperative enterprises, and be thrifty in all other undertakings. Everything should be done on the principle of thrift." Then, everyone discussed the matter of buying the trunk. Zhaofeng did not say a word. Su Sheng knew that he had not fully understood, so when he spoke, he did not mention the matter of buying the trunk but talked about another incident. He said: "In 1943, our guerrilla unit in Pingbei fought against the enemy. We lived a hard life with the masses. At that time, we had very few belongings—just the clothes we wore, the weapons we carried, and a few books of Chairman Mao's works. Where were there any trunks? In winter, when the enemy attacked, we wore all our clothes, both cotton and single-layered. In summer, the clothes we did not wear were 'hidden' by the villagers. The broad masses were our 'safe deposit boxes.' Later, we moved to the mountains. When the enemy searched, we hid our printing presses and clothes in 'cliffs' and covered them with stones, making them our 'natural boxes.' When the enemy retreated, we opened our 'boxes,' took out the printing presses, and immediately engaged in new battles. This is how we defeated the Japanese devils." Su Sheng said meaningfully:

"Revolution is not about relying on supplies, but on the invincible Mao Zedong Thought." These words, heavy with meaning, struck a chord in Zhaofeng's heart. Zhaofeng excitedly said:

"Dad gave me a vivid political lesson. In the past, when I talked about thrift, I could also talk a lot, but when faced with a specific problem, I became confused. Buying this trunk was because the bourgeois ideology in my head surfaced unconsciously. When I go to the countryside, I will definitely maintain and carry forward the spirit of hard work and struggle like the revolutionary forerunners. In this vast countryside, I will consciously undergo reform, take root, bloom, and bear fruit."

On the morning of June 10, 157 graduates, facing the golden sun, marched towards Hebei's Beibu with vigorous steps. Zhaofeng, carrying an old wooden box, happily walked at the front of the queue.

    新皮箱换成旧木箱
    校革委会主任苏生，迈着轻快的步伐，从学校回到家里。今天他特别高兴，因为他儿子苏朝风很快就要走上毛主席指引的同工农相结合的道路了。
    一进门，他看见床上放着一只新皮箱。还没等他问，朝风就兴奋地说：“爸爸，这是我买的，到农村去用的东西都准备好了。”家里有旧箱子，为啥还买新的？苏生同志不觉一愣。他想，买只箱子是小事，但这说明朝风还没有从思想上做好去农村的准备。带着这种思想怎能和贫下中农打成一片，在农村扎根一辈子呢！
    晚上，家庭毛泽东思想学习班开课了，首先学习了毛主席“勤俭办工厂，勤俭办商店，勤俭办一切国营事业和合作事业，勤俭办一切其他事业，什么事情都应当执行勤俭的原则”的教导。接着大家对买箱子这件事议论开了。朝风一句话也没说。苏生同志知道他还没完全想通，所以发言时就没提买箱子这件事，却讲了另外一件事。他说：“一九四三年，我们敌后武工队在平北打游击时，跟群众过一样的艰苦生活。那时，我们的东西很简单，只有身上穿的衣服，手里拿的武器和几本毛主席著作，那里还有什么箱子？冬天，一遇敌情，单衣棉衣都穿在身上，夏天，不穿的衣服，老乡就给我们‘坚壁’起来，广大群众是我们武工队的‘保险箱’。后来我们转移到山里去了，敌人搜山，我们就把油印机、衣裳藏到‘崖堂’里，用石头一堵，就成了我们的‘天然箱’。敌人一退，我们打开‘箱子’，取出油印机，马上投入新的战斗。我们就这样打败了日本鬼子。”苏生同志意味深长地说：
  “干革命不是靠物资，是靠战无不胜的毛泽东思想。”这一席语重心长的话，一字一句都说到了朝风的心坎上。朝风激动地说：
  “爸爸给我上了一堂生动的政治课，过去提起艰苦朴素，我也能讲一通，可是一碰到具体问题就模糊了，买这只箱子就是由于头脑里的资产阶级思想冒了尖还不自觉。到了农村，我一定象革命前辈那样保持和发扬艰苦奋斗的思想作风。在农村这个广阔的天地里自觉地进行改造，在那里生根、开花、结果。”
    六月十日早晨，一百五十七名毕业生迎着金色的朝阳，迈着矫健的步伐，向着河北坝上进军了。朝风拎着个旧木箱，高高兴兴地走在队伍的前面。
