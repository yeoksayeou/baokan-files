The British authorities in Hong Kong continue to persecute unjustly arrested patriotic compatriots. Various sectors of Hong Kong's patriotic compatriots have strongly condemned the British authorities' crimes.

New China News Agency, Hong Kong, July 2nd – In recent days, various sectors of Hong Kong's patriotic compatriots have held meetings to strongly condemn the British authorities in Hong Kong for continuing to persecute patriotic compatriots who have been illegally imprisoned. They demand that the British authorities release them unconditionally.

In the past ten days, patriotic compatriots who have been released from prison, parents of persecuted patriotic youth students, family members of patriotic compatriots imprisoned in the Mui Shing Camp, workers' families, students, small traders, the film industry, the publishing industry, and other sectors of patriotic compatriots have held press conferences, discussions, and mass meetings. They pointed out at the meetings: Since last May, when the British authorities in Hong Kong orchestrated this wave of national persecution, over 5,000 patriotic compatriots have been unjustly arrested for defending national dignity and upholding the great thoughts of Mao Zedong. Over 2,000 patriotic compatriots have been thrown into dark prisons, and hundreds of compatriots are still suffering various inhuman treatments in prison, even being deprived of the right to study Chairman Mao's works and progressive newspapers. They demand that the British authorities immediately stop persecuting patriotic compatriots in prison and release them unconditionally.

Parents of persecuted patriotic youth students revealed at a press conference that there are still 75 patriotic youth students imprisoned, aged between 14 and 19. Some have been brutally sentenced to 10 years by the British authorities, with the shortest sentence being one year. The British authorities' savage persecution of patriotic youth is absolutely intolerable.

Patriotic compatriots also exposed the British authorities' increased persecution of patriotic compatriots in prison. They questioned the British authorities: What crime have our patriotic compatriots committed by loving the great leader Chairman Mao and studying and promoting Mao Zedong Thought? The British authorities' continued brutal persecution of them shows that they are still implementing a policy of hostility towards the Chinese people and patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon, which will only backfire and lead to their downfall. In the past ten days, patriotic compatriots from various sectors in Hong Kong and Kowloon have also sent representatives to the British "Secretary for Chinese Affairs" and the "Police Headquarters" and other relevant departments, demanding that the British authorities immediately stop persecuting patriotic compatriots in prison and release them unconditionally.

    港英当局继续迫害无理被捕的爱国同胞
    香港各界爱国同胞严厉谴责港英罪行
    新华社香港二日电香港各界爱国同胞连日来纷纷举行集会，严厉谴责港英当局继续迫害被非法囚禁在狱中的爱国同胞的罪行，并要求港英当局全部释放他们。
    最近十多天来，我出狱爱国同胞、受迫害爱国青少年学生家长、被囚禁在摩星岭集中营的爱国同胞家属、工人家属、学生界、小商贩、电影界、出版界等各界爱国同胞，分别举行记者招待会、座谈会和群众集会。他们在会上指出：自从去年五月港英当局一手制造的这场民族迫害后，五千多名爱国同胞为了维护民族尊严，为了捍卫伟大的毛泽东思想，被无理逮捕，二千多名爱国同胞被投入黑狱，至今还有数百名同胞在狱中遭受各种非人待遇，连学习毛主席著作和进步报刊的权利也被剥夺。他们责令港英当局必须立即停止对狱中爱国同胞的迫害，并无条件全部释放他们。
    遭受迫害的爱国青少年学生的家长在记者招待会上揭露说，目前被囚禁在监狱中的爱国青少年学生还有七十五人，他们的年龄从十四岁到十九岁，有的竟被残暴的港英当局非法判刑达十年之久，最少的也有一年。港英当局如此野蛮地迫害爱国青少年是绝对不能容忍的。
    爱国同胞们还揭露港英当局加重对狱中爱国同胞的种种迫害。他们质问港英当局：我爱国同胞热爱伟大领袖毛主席，学习和宣传毛泽东思想，犯了什么罪？港英当局一再加重对他们的残酷迫害，说明它继续执行与中国人民和港九爱国同胞为敌的政策，这只能是搬起石头打自己的脚，绝不会有好下场的。最近十多天来，港九各界爱国同胞还分别派出代表，前往港英“辅政司署”、“警务处”等有关部门，要求港英当局立即停止对狱中爱国同胞的迫害，并无条件全部释放他们。
