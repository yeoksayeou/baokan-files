Under the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, members of production teams, and grassroots revolutionary cadres in China's rural areas, who have achieved a bumper harvest of summer crops, are now advancing with high spirits. They are resolutely implementing the great directive of the great leader Chairman Mao, "Grasp revolution, promote production," taking class struggle as the key link. In the early rice-producing areas, they are rushing to harvest the early rice, and in the autumn crop-producing areas, they are strengthening field management. At present, the revolutionary tide in the countryside is surging, the production upsurge is rolling forward, and the overall situation is getting better and better, better than ever before.

Under the brilliant illumination of the great Mao Zedong Thought, and amidst the triumphant songs of the victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, China's winter wheat, peas, broad beans, rapeseed, and spring cocoons and tea this year have all been harvested. Now, the season for harvesting early rice has arrived. The vast expanse of early rice stretching across the Five Ridges, both banks of the Yangtze River, and the southeastern coast is mostly ripe, and the masses are organizing to harvest it. Some regions with earlier seasons have already reported bumper harvests of early rice. In the Yangtze and Yellow River basins, after harvesting the summer crops, the people's communes and production teams have all completed the summer sowing tasks in a timely manner. Now, in the autumn crop-producing areas across the country, the masses are meticulously managing the spring-sown and summer-sown autumn crops, including early and late-season dry crops, rice, cotton, oilseeds, sugar crops, hemp, and tobacco, striving for excellence. Many regions reflect that the current autumn crops are generally growing vigorously, and the growth in some regions is the best seen in many years.

The "Sixteen Points" personally formulated by the great leader Chairman Mao point out: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a powerful driving force for the development of social productive forces in our country." The increasingly favorable situation in China's agricultural production this year is a necessary result of the victory and development of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has greatly promoted the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in China's rural areas, and Mao Zedong Thought has been widely popularized in the countryside as never before. Now, in the vast rural areas, various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes are becoming more and more numerous and better and better. Under the help of the People's Liberation Army's agricultural support troops, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and rural revolutionary cadres are resolutely implementing Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, closely following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments, and advancing bravely. They use the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to launch a great exposure, criticism, and struggle against the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, such as China's Khrushchev, and their agents in various places, and against untransformed landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists. Through the revolutionary criticism, the masses' awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines has greatly increased, and their socialist enthusiasm for grasping revolution and promoting production is unprecedentedly high. Since last winter, some regions in the south and north have encountered rare droughts in recent years; some regions have also experienced lower-than-normal temperatures in the spring. These natural disasters not only brought difficulties to spring sowing and summer planting but also were not conducive to the normal growth of crops. However, the hundreds of millions of peasants and rural revolutionary cadres armed with Mao Zedong Thought, relying on the unparalleled superiority of the people's communes, carried forward the revolutionary spirit of Dazhai, and turned the surging revolutionary enthusiasm unleashed in the revolutionary criticism and struggle against the enemy into productive efforts. With the heroic spirit of "defeating all enemies," they fought tenaciously against natural disasters such as drought and low temperatures, finally overcoming these disasters and ensuring the timely completion of spring plowing and summer planting and the growth of crops. Facing the victories already achieved, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and rural revolutionary cadres joyfully said: "Mao Zedong Thought is a powerful weapon both for defeating class enemies and for overcoming natural disasters and developing production. We must take the People's Liberation Army as an example, study and apply Mao Zedong Thought more actively, and let Mao Zedong Thought guide everything."

Members of revolutionary committees at various levels in various places, following Chairman Mao's great teaching of "adhering to the mass line, consulting the masses on everything, and being a small student of the masses," have, in the struggle to grasp revolution and promote production in the countryside, gone deep into the front lines, relied on the masses, respected the masses' spirit of initiative, and led the masses to advance bravely. Many county and commune revolutionary committees, by closely connecting with the masses and paying attention to timely summarizing and promoting the advanced experiences created by revolutionary masses in class struggle and production struggle, have not only powerfully promoted revolutionary criticism and the struggle against the enemy but also powerfully promoted production. Revolutionary committees in many provinces and municipalities, such as Jiangxi, Shandong, Henan, Guangdong, Sichuan, Jiangsu, Beijing, and Shanghai, have also successively organized agricultural support armies to go deep into the countryside, vigorously propagate Mao Zedong Thought, fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and together with the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants grasp revolution and promote production, developing the excellent situation in the countryside.

The agricultural support troops of the Chinese People's Liberation Army have played a tremendous role in the great struggle to grasp revolution and promote production in various rural areas. They have brought the fine tradition of the People's Liberation Army actively studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, emphasizing proletarian politics, adhering to the four firsts, and carrying forward the spirit of the May Fourth Movement to the countryside. The broad masses of officers and soldiers, together with the poor and lower-middle peasants and rural revolutionary cadres in various places, have resolutely implemented Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, actively studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, carried out revolutionary criticism, struggled against selfishness and revisionism, powerfully promoted the thought revolution of the members, promoted production, and received enthusiastic praise from the broad masses.

At present, the hundreds of millions of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres in China's rural areas, under the encouragement of the excellent situation of achieving a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, are holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, taking the struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines as the key link, and are confidently focusing on the work of fertilizing, weeding, and pest control for autumn crops, meticulously managing the fields. They are determined to achieve a bumper harvest of autumn crops and achieve a double victory in revolution and production for the whole year.

    我国农村革命和生产形势一片大好，比以往任何时候都好
    各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班越办越多越办越好
    广大贫下中农抓革命、促生产的积极性空前高涨
    据新华社十六日讯　高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，夺得了夏收作物丰收的我国农村广大贫下中农、社员群众和基层革命干部，正在意气风发地乘胜前进。他们坚决贯彻执行伟大领袖毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，以阶级斗争为纲，在早稻产区正在抢收早稻，在秋收作物地区正在加强田间管理。当前，全国农村革命洪流汹涌澎湃，生产高潮滚滚向前，整个形势越来越好，比以往任何时候都好。
    在伟大的毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的凯歌声中，今年我国的越冬麦类、蚕豆、豌豆、油菜籽等夏收作物和春茧、春茶都获得了丰收。现在，早稻收获季节又已来临。分布在五岭南北、长江两岸和东南沿海一带连绵无际的早稻，大部已经陆续黄熟，广大社员正在组织抢收。一部分季节较早的地区，已经传来早稻丰收的喜讯。在长江和黄河流域，各人民公社生产队收罢夏收作物之后，都适时地完成了夏种任务。现在在全国秋收作物地区，广大社员正对春播和夏种的秋收作物，包括早秋和晚秋旱粮作物、水稻、棉花、油料、糖料、麻类和烟草等，精益求精地进行田间管理。许多地区反映，当前秋收作物普遍生长茁壮，部分地区长势之好为多年来所少见。
    伟大领袖毛主席亲自主持制定的“十六条”指出：“无产阶级文化大革命是使我国社会生产力发展的一个强大的推动力。”今年我国农业生产形势越来越好，正是无产阶级文化大革命运动胜利发展的必然结果。
    史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命，大大推动了我国农村活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动，毛泽东思想在全国农村得到空前未有的大普及。现在，在广大农村，各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，越办越多，越办越好。广大贫下中农和农村革命干部，在人民解放军支农部队的帮助下，坚决贯彻毛主席的一系列最新指示，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署奋勇前进。他们以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，对中国赫鲁晓夫等党内一小撮最大的走资派及其在各地的代理人，对没有改造好的地、富、反、坏、右分子等，展开了大揭发、大批判、大斗争。通过革命大批判，广大社员阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟大大提高，抓革命、促生产的社会主义积极性空前高涨。去年冬天以来，南方和北方都有一些地区遇到了近年来少有的干旱；还有一些地区，在春季出现了气温偏低的现象。这些自然灾害不仅给春播、夏种带来了困难，同时也不利于农作物的正常生长。但是，用毛泽东思想武装起来的亿万农民群众和农村革命干部，依靠人民公社的无比优越性，发扬大寨的革命精神，把在革命大批判和对敌斗争中焕发出来的冲天革命干劲用到生产上去，以“要压倒一切敌人”的英雄气概，同干旱、低温等自然灾害展开了顽强的搏斗，终于战胜了这些灾害，保证了春耕夏种的适时完成和农作物的生长。在已经取得的胜利面前，广大贫下中农和农村革命干部无限欢欣地说：“毛泽东思想既是战胜阶级敌人的强大武器，又是战胜自然灾害、发展生产的强大武器。我们一定以人民解放军为榜样，更好地活学活用毛泽东思想，用毛泽东思想统帅一切。”
    各地各级革命委员会的成员，遵照毛主席“要坚持群众路线，遇事多和群众商量，做群众的小学生”的伟大教导，在农村抓革命、促生产的斗争中，深入第一线，依靠群众，尊重群众的首创精神，带领群众奋勇前进。许多县、社的革委会，由于紧密联系群众，注意及时总结和推广革命群众在阶级斗争和生产斗争中创造的先进经验，不但有力地推动了革命大批判和对敌斗争，同时也有力地推动了生产。江西、山东、河南、广东、四川、江苏、北京、上海等许多省、市的革命委员会，还先后组织支农大军深入农村，大力宣传毛泽东思想，全面落实毛主席的最新指示，同广大贫下中农一起抓革命、促生产，发展了农村的大好形势。
    中国人民解放军的支农部队，在各地农村抓革命、促生产的伟大斗争中发挥了巨大的作用。他们把人民解放军活学活用毛泽东思想，突出无产阶级政治，坚持四个第一，大兴三八作风的优良传统带到了农村。广大指战员和各地贫下中农、农村革命干部一道，坚决落实毛主席的一系列最新指示，活学活用毛主席著作，开展革命大批判，斗私批修，有力地促进了社员的思想革命化，推动了生产，受到了广大社员的热烈赞扬。
    当前，我国农村的亿万贫下中农和革命干部，在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的大好形势鼓舞下，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，以两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争为纲，正满怀信心地大抓秋收作物的追肥、除草和治虫等工作，精细地进行田间管理，他们决心夺取秋收作物大丰收，取得全年的革命、生产双胜利。
