The revolutionary criticism has effectively promoted the work of streamlining and downsizing. The Revolutionary Committee of the Shanghai Bicycle Lock Factory has severely criticized the counter-revolutionary revisionist black goods of the Chinese Khrushchev, breaking out of the old institutional framework, and promoting the revolutionization of the leadership cadre.

New China News Agency, Shanghai, July 18 - The Revolutionary Committee of the Shanghai Bicycle Lock Factory, in accordance with Chairman Mao's teaching that "the reform of state organs, the most fundamental point, is to connect with the masses," has carried forward the spirit of thorough proletarian revolution. Through revolutionary criticism, it has broken out of the old institutional framework and has taken a big step forward on the revolutionary path of connecting with the masses.

The Shanghai Bicycle Lock Factory is a small factory with over 400 people. However, due to a small clique of capitalist roaders within the Party who vigorously promoted the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of the Chinese Khrushchev, this small factory established a huge management structure of nine departments and two offices, with 58 full-time staff. They also implemented a set of "control, restrict, and suppress" systems, severely restricting the socialist enthusiasm of the workers and obstructing the development of productive forces. In May last year, after the establishment of the factory revolutionary committee, the old leadership of the factory still existed, with overlapping structures and redundant personnel. Later, the factory revolutionary committee, based on the opinions of the workers, designed a plan for institutional reform, but the structure remained cumbersome, and the number of personnel compared to the original factory department did not decrease.

Why couldn't streamlining and downsizing be carried out? What is the problem? The Revolutionary Committee, with problems in mind, studied and applied Chairman Mao's works. Chairman Mao taught: "Without destruction, there can be no construction. Destruction is criticism, is revolution. Destruction must be reasoned, and reasoning is construction. Destruction comes first, and construction is within it." They used Chairman Mao's teachings to review and examine the previous stage of streamlining and downsizing work, finding the answer. The main problem is that the counter-revolutionary revisionist black goods of the Chinese Khrushchev have not been thoroughly criticized, but rather, streamlining has been done on a case-by-case basis, closing the door to formulate plans, and the result is just a list of names. This major and serious class struggle of "streamlining and downsizing" has been seen too simply. Through study and discussion, the members of the Revolutionary Committee further realized that to do a good job of streamlining and downsizing, it is necessary to mobilize the masses and rely on the masses, and it is necessary to put "destruction" first. Only by thoroughly criticizing the revisionist black goods of the Chinese Khrushchev in politics, ideology, and theory, and making everyone distinguish between Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of the Chinese Khrushchev, can the direction be clear and the reform be good in the work of streamlining and downsizing.

After the Revolutionary Committee reached a consensus, it immediately mobilized the masses to study Chairman Mao's teachings on the construction of political power, using the production teams as the starting point, severely criticizing the counter-revolutionary revisionist line promoted by the Chinese Khrushchev. To carry out this revolutionary criticism and promote the work of streamlining and downsizing, the Revolutionary Committee organized all the departmental cadres of the factory to go to various production teams to study, criticize, and research the work of streamlining and downsizing together with the workers. In the production team criticism meetings, revolutionary workers, armed with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, deeply criticized the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of the Chinese Khrushchev, raising the class struggle and two-line struggle consciousness of the broad revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres. The departmental cadres who had reservations about streamlining and downsizing also fought against selfishness and criticized revisionism, overcoming selfish thoughts, and unanimously demanded a thorough reform of the old institutions, breaking out of the old institutional framework, and going to the production front line.

"Destruction comes first, and construction is within it." Through revolutionary criticism, the way has been cleared in thought for implementing streamlining and downsizing and organizing a revolutionary leadership cadre that connects with the masses. The members of the Revolutionary Committee and the responsible persons of the revolutionary mass organizations took the lead in firmly implementing "being both an official and a common person," settling down in the production teams. The factory-level revolutionary mass organizations abolished full-time non-production personnel and insisted on revolutionizing in their spare time. In the organizational structure of the factory, the overlapping administrative structures were broken, and the original cumbersome management structure was simplified into four groups: political propaganda, production service, living service, and logistics. The number of production teams in the entire factory was reduced from 23 to 12. The production, logistics, and living work departments, in addition to the necessary administrative management personnel, all the other cadres were settled in the production teams.

Now, the factory has only 28 full-time or part-time administrative management personnel. The office of the Revolutionary Committee has only one staff member responsible for reception and liaison work. When personnel from higher-level organs or other units need to directly contact the responsible persons of the Revolutionary Committee, they are led to the production teams by the receptionist.

The members of the Revolutionary Committee settled in the teams, moving their foothold from the office to the production teams, participating in labor and movements in the guise of ordinary workers, taking the lead in fighting against selfishness and criticizing revisionism in the Mao Zedong Thought study classes, often chatting with workers, promptly discovering problems, and solving them on the spot. Because the cadres have gone deep into the front line, studying, living, and fighting with the masses, it has effectively promoted the revolutionization of the leadership cadre. Member of the Revolutionary Committee Ge Aduo was originally a worker in the kitchen. After returning to the kitchen, he gets up at three or four in the morning to buy vegetables, works with the workers during the day, and studies with other members of the Revolutionary Committee at night to discuss the revolutionary and production affairs of the entire factory. The workers unanimously reflected: In the past, when there were problems, workers went upstairs; now, when there are problems, cadres go downstairs; where there are difficulties, cadres are there to support. Such a Revolutionary Committee is good, we trust it!

    革命大批判有力地推动精兵简政工作
    上海自行车锁厂革委会狠批中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义黑货，跳出旧机构的圈子，促进了领导班子革命化
    新华社上海十八日电　上海自行车锁厂革委会遵照毛主席“国家机关的改革，最根本的一条，就是联系群众”的教导，发扬无产阶级彻底革命精神，通过革命大批判，跳出了旧机构的圈子，在革命化的联系群众的大道上前进了一大步。
    上海自行车锁厂是一个四百多人的小厂。但是由于党内一小撮走资派竭力推行中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义路线，这个小厂竟建立了一套庞大的九股二室的管理机构，脱产人员多达五十八人。他们还推行了一套“管、卡、压”的制度，严重地束缚了工人的社会主义积极性，阻碍了生产力的发展。去年五月，厂革命委员会成立后，原厂部的老班子仍然存在，机构重叠，人浮于事。后来，厂革委会根据工人的意见，虽然设计了一个机构改革方案，但是机构依然庞大，人员和原厂部比较并没有减少。
    精兵简政为什么搞不下去？问题在那里？厂革委会带着问题活学活用毛主席著作。毛主席教导说：“不破不立。破，就是批判，就是革命。破，就要讲道理，讲道理就是立，破字当头，立也就在其中了。”他们用毛主席的教导，对照检查了前一段的精兵简政工作，找到了答案。问题主要在于：对中国赫鲁晓夫的一套反革命修正主义黑货没有批深批透，而是就事论事搞精简，关起门来订方案，搞来搞去是名单。把“精兵简政”这场具有重大意义的严肃的阶级斗争，看得太简单了。经过学习、讨论，革委会成员进一步认识到，要搞好精兵简政，必须发动群众，依靠群众，必须“破”字当头。只有把中国赫鲁晓夫的修正主义黑货从政治上、思想上、理论上彻底批深批透，使大家分清什么是毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，什么是中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义路线，这样，在精兵简政工作上才能方向明，改得好。
    厂革委会统一认识以后，立即发动群众，大学毛主席有关政权建设方面的教导，以班组为基点，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫所推行的反革命修正主义路线。为了搞好这场革命大批判，推动精兵简政工作，厂革委会又组织全厂科室干部到各个班组去和工人一起学习，一起批判，一起研究精兵简政工作。在班组批判会上，革命职工以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，对中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义路线的深刻批判，使广大革命群众和革命干部提高了阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟。原来对精兵简政有顾虑的科室干部，也都斗私批修，克服私心杂念，纷纷要求彻底改革旧机构，从旧机构的圈子里跳出来，到生产第一线去。
      “破字当头，立在其中”。通过革命的大批判，为实行精兵简政，组织起一个革命化的联系群众的领导班子，从思想上扫清了道路。厂革委会成员和革命群众组织负责人首先带头，坚决做到“既当‘官’，又当老百姓”，“落户”于生产班组。厂级革命群众组织撤销了专职脱产人员，坚持业余闹革命。在厂的组织机构上，打破了重叠的行政机构，把原来的庞杂管理机构，简化为政治宣传、生产服务、生活服务、后勤四个组，并且将全厂二十三个生产组合并为十二个组。生产、后勤、生活等工作部门，除了必需的行政管理人员以外，其余的干部全部“落户”到了生产班组。
    现在这个厂只有二十八个脱产或半脱产的行政管理人员。厂革委会办公室，只留一个工作人员负责接待和联系工作。上级机关或外单位来访人员需要直接和厂革委会负责人联系时，就由接待人员领到生产班组去联系。
    厂革委会成员“落户”到班组，把立足点从办公室移到了生产班组，以普通工人的姿态，参加劳动，参加运动，在毛泽东思想学习班里带头斗私批修，经常找工人谈心，及时发现问题，就地解决。由于干部深入第一线，同群众学习在一起，生活在一起，战斗在一起，有力地促进了领导班子的革命化。厂革委会委员葛阿多原是炊事房的工人，回炊事房以后，每天早晨三四点钟起床买菜，白天和工人一起劳动，晚上和厂革委会其他委员一起研究全厂革命和生产大事。工人同志一致反映说：过去有问题，工人朝上跑；现在有问题，干部朝下跑；那里有困难，干部就在那里顶。这样的革委会就是好，我们信得过！
