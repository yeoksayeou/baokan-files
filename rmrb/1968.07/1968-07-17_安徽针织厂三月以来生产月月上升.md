The Anhui Knitting Factory Revolutionary Committee has united with the broad revolutionary masses, struck hard at a handful of class enemies, and carried out in-depth and sustained revolutionary criticism and struggle. This has pushed the factory's revolution and production forward. Since the establishment of the factory's Revolutionary Committee in mid-March this year, the factory's output has increased month by month. In June, the average daily production of knitted goods was 1.6 times higher than before the establishment of the Revolutionary Committee, and cotton yarn production increased by 64 percent.

After the establishment of the Revolutionary Committee, it united and led the broad revolutionary masses to launch a fierce attack on a handful of class enemies. The revolutionary workers, armed with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, conducted in-depth investigations and research, and exposed a handful of traitors, spies, and unrepentant capitalist-roaders. They linked these class enemies with the handful of capitalist-roaders in the Party, such as China's Khrushchev, and carried out extensive exposure and criticism.

Through the revolutionary criticism and struggle, the revolutionary workers' consciousness of class struggle and line struggle has been greatly heightened, and their spiritual outlook has undergone tremendous changes. This has ensured the continuous advancement of the factory's revolution and production.

    安徽针织厂三月以来生产月月上升
    安徽针织厂革委会团结广大革命群众，狠狠打击一小撮阶级敌人，深入持久地开展革命大批判，推动全厂革命和生产向前发展。从今年三月中旬成立厂革委会以来，全厂产量月月上升。六月份，针织品平均日产水平比革委会成立前增长了一点六倍，棉纱增长百分之六十四。
    这个厂的革委会成立后，团结和带领广大革命群众，向一小撮阶级敌人展开猛烈进攻。广大革命职工以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，经过深入的调查研究，揪出了一小撮叛徒、特务和顽固不化的走资派，并且把这些阶级敌人同中国赫鲁晓夫等党内一小撮最大的走资派挂起钩来，进行大揭大批。
    通过革命大批判，全厂革命职工阶级斗争和路线斗争觉悟大大提高，精神面貌发生了巨大的变化，保证了全厂革命和生产向前发展。
