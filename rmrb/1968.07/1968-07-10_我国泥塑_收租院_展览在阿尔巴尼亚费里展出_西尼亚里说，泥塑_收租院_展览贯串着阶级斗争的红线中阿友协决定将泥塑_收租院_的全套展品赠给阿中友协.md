	China's clay sculpture "Rent Collection Courtyard" exhibition, after concluding its display in the Albanian capital of Tirana, began its exhibition in the Albanian industrial city of Fier on the 6th.

	The exhibition hall was adorned with portraits of the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao, and the great leader of the Albanian people, Comrade Enver Hoxha, as well as the national flags of the two countries. Many workers, members of agricultural cooperatives, soldiers and officers of the People's Army, and officials from various departments attended the opening ceremony.

	Among the attendees were members of the Albanian Labor Party Central Committee, Secretary of the Fier District Committee Sheme, Chairman of the Executive Committee of the Fier People's Assembly Prophi, and Chairman of the Albanian Foreign Cultural Liaison Committee Treska.

	The acting charge d'affaires of the Chinese Embassy in Albania, Li Tingquan, was also invited to attend the opening ceremony.

	Xinniari, Vice Chairman of the Fier People's Assembly Executive Committee, spoke at the opening ceremony. He said that the clay sculpture "Rent Collection Courtyard" marks a new stage in Chinese sculpture art and is a new victory for Chinese revolutionary artists in implementing the teachings of the great leader of the Chinese people, Comrade Mao Zedong, that literature and art should serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers.

	Xinniari said that every group of sculptures in this exhibition is permeated with the theme of class struggle. Especially for the people of our country in the Muzakeq Plain, who have suffered greatly under the oppression of landlords, this exhibition has great educational significance. Let the people of Muzakeq see this exhibition! Let them never forget class struggle and proletarian dictatorship, and always emphasize proletarian politics in all work, so that our socialist motherland will continue to advance.

	He pointed out that this exhibition is a great school of class struggle. After seeing this exhibition, one can clearly understand the great significance of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution initiated and led by Comrade Mao Zedong.

	Xinniari pointed out that under the guidance of Chairman Mao's brilliant theories, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China is advancing victoriously and has already achieved decisive victories. The reactionary forces represented by the Chinese Khrushchev have suffered a shameful defeat. The situation in China is better than ever before. The thoughts of Mao Zedong and the proletarian revolutionary line of Chairman Mao are being grasped by the masses. The broad revolutionary masses are carrying the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end. This is a shining example for all revolutionary forces in the world and a great encouragement to them.

	In his speech, Xinniari also enthusiastically praised the fraternal fighting friendship between the peoples of Albania and China, forged by the great leader of the Albanian people, Comrade Enver Hoxha, and the great leader of the Chinese people, Comrade Mao Zedong. He said that no force in the world can destroy this friendship, which is based on the principles of Marxism-Leninism. The clay sculpture "Rent Collection Courtyard" exhibition will further strengthen the fraternal fighting friendship between our two peoples.

	New China News Agency, Tirana, July 7th: Recently, Chairman of the Albania-China Friendship Association, Kelezi, received the acting charge d'affaires of the Chinese Embassy in Albania, Li Tingquan. During the meeting, Li Tingquan conveyed that the China-Albania Friendship Association, in order to strengthen the unbreakable fighting friendship between the peoples of China and Albania, decided to donate the entire set of exhibits from the "Rent Collection Courtyard" clay sculpture exhibition, which was displayed in Tirana on April 26th, to the Albania-China Friendship Association.

	Comrade Kelezi, on behalf of the Albania-China Friendship Association and the Albanian people, expressed heartfelt thanks to the China-Albania Friendship Association and the Chinese people.

    新华社地拉那七日电　中国泥塑“收租院”展览结束了在阿尔巴尼亚首都地拉那的展出以后，六日又在阿尔巴尼亚工业城市费里开始展出。
    这个展览在费里开幕时，会场正中间悬挂着中国人民的伟大领袖毛主席和阿尔巴尼亚人民的伟大领袖恩维尔·霍查同志的画像以及中阿两国的国旗。费里区的许多工人、农业生产合作社社员、人民军指战员和机关干部等出席了开幕式。
    出席开幕式的还有，阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央委员会委员、费里区委员会书记谢梅、区人民会议执行委员会主席普罗菲和阿尔巴尼亚对外文化联络委员会主席特雷斯卡等。
    中国驻阿尔巴尼亚大使馆临时代办李庭荃也应邀出席了开幕式。
    费里区人民会议执行委员会副主席西尼亚里在开幕式上讲了话。他说，泥塑“收租院”开辟了中国雕塑艺术的新阶段，是中国革命艺术工作者贯彻中国人民的伟大领袖毛泽东同志关于文学艺术为工农兵服务的教导的新胜利。
    西尼亚里说，这个展览的每一组塑像都贯串了阶级斗争的红线。特别是对于过去受尽地主压迫的穆泽克亚平原的我国人民来说，这个展览具有重大的教育意义。让穆泽克亚人看一看这个展览吧！让他们永远不要忘记阶级斗争和无产阶级专政，在一切工作中突出无产阶级政治，以便使我们的社会主义祖国永远前进。
    他指出，这个展览是阶级斗争的大学校。看了这个展览以后，就可以清楚地了解毛泽东同志所发动和领导的中国无产阶级文化大革命的重大意义。
    西尼亚里指出，在毛主席的光辉学说指引下，中国无产阶级文化大革命正在胜利前进，并且已经取得了决定性的胜利。以中国赫鲁晓夫为代表的资产阶级反动势力遭到了可耻的失败。中国的形势比以往任何时候都好，毛泽东思想和毛主席的无产阶级革命路线正在被人民群众所掌握。广大革命人民群众正在把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。这是全世界革命力量的光辉榜样，是对他们的巨大鼓舞。
    西尼亚里在讲话中还热情称颂了由阿尔巴尼亚人民的伟大领袖霍查同志和中国人民的伟大领袖毛泽东同志缔造起来的阿中两国人民的战斗友谊。他说，世界上没有任何力量能够破坏得了这一建立在马克思列宁主义原则基础上的友谊。泥塑“收租院”展览将进一步加强我们两国人民之间的兄弟般的战斗友谊。
