We felt particularly close to the Beijing Peking Opera Troupe's performance of the revolutionary modern Peking opera "The Harbor." It brought the struggles of dock workers like us onto the Peking opera stage for the first time in history. This is the greatest concern and encouragement from our great leader Chairman Mao. Let us shout "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand times, ten thousand times!"

"The Harbor" is a model opera personally cultivated by Comrade Jiang Qing, a jewel of proletarian new literature. The play successfully portrays the noble image of the working class in the socialist era. The character Fang Haizhen in the play is truly our good secretary; Gao Zhiyang is truly our good team leader, and the old worker Ma Hongliang is truly our good comrade. The words and deeds of these heroes express our dock workers' great aspirations. They vividly reflect the struggles on the harbor docks and truly show our dock workers' high qualities in building socialism and supporting the revolutionary people of the world. It vividly expresses our spirit of standing on the dock, cherishing the motherland, and looking at the world, embodying patriotism and internationalism.

The heroes in the play follow the teachings of our great leader Chairman Mao to "serve the people of the whole of China and the world." They regard the ordinary work of loading and unloading as an internationalist duty to support the world revolution. In their hearts, every package and item is connected to the world's winds and clouds. After Fang Haizhen and Gao Zhiyang discovered the scattered package incident, they thought of the country's honor and supporting the revolutionary people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America. They immediately gathered all the team members to trace the source, search the warehouse at night, and check each of the two thousand bags of wheat. Later, they found that the scattered wheat had been mistakenly loaded onto a barge heading to Wusong. In this extremely urgent situation, Gao Zhiyang, despite the thunder and rain, bravely went out to sea, caught up with the barge, retrieved the scattered packages, and successfully completed the foreign aid mission.

Watching this play has deeply educated us. Remembering the old society, we dock workers suffered under the oppression of the "three big mountains" and were called "stinking carriers." We spent the whole day carrying, loading, pulling, and lifting, but still worried about food and drink. It was Chairman Mao who saved us from the pit of fire, made us masters of our own fate, and gave us today's happy life.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The people who have already won the revolution should aid the struggle of those who are still striving for liberation." However, Liu Shaoqi, the Chinese Khrushchev, goes against Chairman Mao, advocating the fallacies of "three reconciliations and one reduction," saying that we should reconcile with imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries of all countries, and reduce aid to countries fighting for national liberation. He attempts to make us reconcile with the enemy and distance ourselves from our kin. We dock workers in Tianjin Harbor strongly oppose this a thousand times, ten thousand times. We resolutely expose and thoroughly criticize his devilish talk!

During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, Liu Shaoqi and his agents attempted to turn Tianjin Harbor into a "dead harbor," disrupting the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and our support for the revolutionary people of the world. However, the dock workers armed with Mao Zedong Thought can move mountains and fill seas, overcoming all difficulties and dangers. Under the personal care of Chairman Mao and with the strong support of the People's Liberation Army, we withstood the evil winds and waves, smashed the sabotage plots of a handful of class enemies, and ensured the smooth completion of foreign aid tasks. Since the establishment of the revolutionary committee, the red political power of the harbor, the revolutionary situation has been getting better and better, production has been rising month by month, and in June, we created a new historical record since the harbor's establishment. We have successfully completed the battle to support the people of the world, giving Liu Shaoqi another resounding slap in the face.

The heroic characters in "The Harbor" will forever be our examples to learn from. We will use Mao Zedong Thought to guide everything, firmly grasp class struggle, deeply and persistently carry out the great criticism of the revolution, thoroughly criticize the revisionist line of Liu Shaoqi, and resolutely defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. For the construction of socialism and for supporting the anti-imperialist and anti-revisionist struggles of the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, we will contribute all our strength.

    身在码头  胸怀祖国  放眼世界
    天津港装卸工人　杜学良　唐志文
    看了北京京剧团演出的革命现代京剧《海港》，我们感到特别亲切。它把我们码头工人的斗争生活搬上京剧舞台，这是有史以来第一回。这是我们伟大领袖毛主席他老人家对我们海港码头工人的最大关怀，最大鞭策。让我们千遍万遍高呼毛主席万岁！万万岁！
    《海港》这出戏，是江青同志亲手培育的样板戏，是无产阶级新文艺的明珠。戏中成功地塑造了社会主义时代工人阶级的崇高形象。戏中的方海珍同志真是我们的好书记；高志扬同志真是我们的好组长，老工人马洪亮真是我们的好伙伴。这些英雄人物的一言一行都表达了我们码头工人的豪情壮志。生动地反映了海港码头上的斗争生活，真实地表现了我们码头工人为建设社会主义，为支援世界革命人民的崇高品质；它形象地表达了我们身在码头，胸怀祖国，放眼世界的爱国主义和国际主义的精神。
    戏中的英雄们，遵照我们伟大领袖毛主席“为全中国人民和全世界人民服务”的教导，把平凡的装卸工作，看作是支援世界革命的国际主义义务。在他们的心上，这一包包一件件，都紧连着世界风云。方海珍、高志扬发现散包事故以后，他们想的是祖国的荣誉，想的是支援亚非拉革命人民。他们立即集合全组同志追根寻源，连夜翻仓，把两千包小麦逐一查清。后来又发现散包小麦已错当大米装上驳船开往吴淞。在这万分紧急的情况下，高志扬又不顾雷雨交加，冒险出海，追上驳船，调回散包，胜利地完成了援外任务。
    看了这出戏，使我们受到了深刻的教育。回想起旧社会，我们码头工人受尽了“三座大山”的压迫，被人叫作“臭扛大个”的。我们整天背、搭、拉、扛，还是愁吃愁喝。是毛主席他老人家把我们从火坑里救了出来，我们当了家，做了主，才有了今天的幸福生活。
    毛主席教导我们说：“已经获得革命胜利的人民，应该援助正在争取解放的人民的斗争”。中国赫鲁晓夫却和毛主席唱反调，大肆鼓吹“三和一少”的谬论，胡说什么对帝国主义、修正主义、各国反动派要和，对民族解放斗争的国家援助要少。妄图让我们跟敌人和，跟亲人疏。我们海港码头工人一千个不答应，一万个反对。我们坚决把他这套鬼话揭穿，批深批透！
    无产阶级文化大革命期间，中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人，妄图把我们天津港变成“死港”，来破坏无产阶级文化大革命，破坏我们对全世界革命人民的支援。但是，用毛泽东思想武装起来的码头工人，山再高也能搬，海再深也能填，千难万险挡不住。在毛主席他老人家亲切关怀下，在解放军的大力支持下，我们顶住了歪风，战胜了恶浪，粉碎了一小撮阶级敌人的破坏阴谋，保证了援外任务顺利完成。自从海港的红色政权——革命委员会建立后，革命形势越来越好，生产月月上升，六月份创造了建港以来的历史最高纪录。我们胜利完成了支援世界人民的战斗任务，给了中国赫鲁晓夫又一记响亮的耳光。
      《海港》中的英雄人物，永远是我们学习的榜样。我们要用毛泽东思想统帅一切，狠抓阶级斗争，深入持久地开展革命的大批判，彻底批判中国赫鲁晓夫的修正主义路线，坚决捍卫毛主席的革命路线。为建设社会主义、为支援亚非拉人民反帝反修斗争，贡献我们的一切力量。
