The soldiers of a certain island garrison, during a drought, not only supplied water from their camp to the locals but also helped the locals to reopen five dried-up wells, ensuring that all the island's fishermen could drink sweet water.

The drought was getting worse, and the water supply for the soldiers and civilians on a certain island in the Yellow Sea was becoming increasingly problematic. The political instructor of the 5th Company, Lu Shiren, racked his brains to find a way to solve this urgent problem.

One day, someone suggested: "To ensure water for all the soldiers, we should control the wells in the camp." Lu Shiren disagreed with this idea. He believed that in a situation where water is as precious as pearls, who should get the water first? This is not a small matter; it reflects the attitude towards the people. Although the environment is harsh and water is becoming increasingly scarce, as soldiers of the people, we must always consider the people's interests and never harm their interests. He decided to use every possible means and make every effort to solve the water problem in time; at the same time, this "controlling the wells" mentality must be corrected immediately.

The next day, the entire company held a lively discussion around the issue of whether the wells should be controlled. Everyone studied Chairman Mao's teachings on the mass line and serving the people, compared themselves, and finally agreed unanimously: Caring for the people and being concerned about their hardships is our army's glorious tradition and the duty of revolutionary soldiers. Currently, only the camp wells have water. Should we control the wells or not? This is a big issue of whether we care for the people or not. We are the people's soldiers, revolutionary soldiers nurtured by Chairman Mao himself. The more difficult the situation, the more we should show the spirit of the people's soldiers. Apart from giving the water from the wells to the fishermen first, everyone decided to dig out water from all the other dried-up wells and completely solve the island's water problem.

Under the leadership of the party branch, all the soldiers of the company immediately took action, carrying water to every household while day and night they dug wells. Everyone was eager to participate, unafraid of the dirty water in the wells, and unconcerned about the scorching sun overhead. The platoon leader, Jiang Shuzhi, worked in the well despite his illness; the new soldier, Li Jinfang, did not leave the front line even after being injured and bleeding. After five days and nights of hard work, the five dried-up wells finally gushed out clear spring water.

When all the fishermen on the island drank the clear, sweet water, they were all overjoyed and had an indescribable happiness. A 60-year-old martyr's family member, Old Man Song Enwen, excitedly said, "The army trained by Chairman Mao is truly like our own children. Thinking back to the past, the Japanese soldiers specifically harmed us civilians; looking at today, the People's Liberation Army has only one thought in mind: the people. I am truly happy from the bottom of my heart!" Old Lady Chang Xiuzhi, holding the soldier's hand, gratefully said, "The soldiers trained by Chairman Mao are truly good!"

The propaganda team of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Shanxi's Jin Dongnan came to Xigou Brigade, where the national labor model Li Shunda is located, and presented "The Three Articles" and "Quotations from Chairman Mao" to the poor and lower-middle peasants.

    人民子弟兵一心为人民
    一个海岛上的解放军，在天旱季节，不仅把营区的水供给群众，还帮助群众重开五眼枯井，使全岛渔民都能喝到甜水。
    天，越来越旱，黄海某岛军民的吃水越来越成问题。驻岛五连指导员陆诗伦绞尽脑汁，琢磨用什么办法才能彻底解决这个迫在眉睫的难题？
    一天，有人提出：为了全连同志吃水，要把营区内的水井管起来。陆诗伦同志不同意这个意见。他认为，在目前水如珍珠的情况下，水应当先给谁吃？这决不是一件小事情，它反映了对待群众的态度问题。虽然环境很艰苦，吃水越来越困难，但是作为人民的子弟兵，必须处处为群众着想，决不能有丝毫损害群众利益的行为。他决定想尽一切办法，尽最大的努力，及时解决吃水问题；同时，对这种“管井”的思想，也须立即纠正。
    第二天，全连同志便围绕着指导员提出的“水井该不该管”的问题，展开了热烈的讨论。大家共同学习了毛主席有关群众路线和为人民服务的教导，对照检查了自己，最后一致认为：爱护群众，关心群众的疾苦，是我军的光荣传统，是革命战士义不容辞的职责。目前，岛上只有我们营区水井有水，是不是把水井管起来，是关心不关心群众的大问题。我们是人民的子弟兵，是毛主席亲手培养出来的革命战士，越是在这困难的情况下，越要表现出人民子弟兵的本色。除了水井的水应当先让给渔民用外，大家决定再把其它干枯了的水井全部挖出水来，彻底解决岛上的吃水问题。
    在党支部的带领下，全连指战员立即行动，一边把水一担一担地送到每家每户，一边夜以继日地展开了挖水井的战斗，大家争先恐后，不怕水井里泥水脏臭，不怕火辣辣的太阳当头暴晒。三排长姜树志带病坚持下井，干劲十足；新战士李进芳受伤流血，不下火线。经过五天五夜的战斗，五眼枯井终于流出了清清的泉水。
    当全岛渔民喝着清澄澄的甜水时，个个笑逐颜开，心里有说不出的高兴。六十多岁的烈属宋恩文老大爷兴奋地说：“毛主席他老人家教导出来的军队，个个亲如子弟。想想过去，鬼子兵专门祸害咱老百姓；看看今天，解放军一个心眼想着群众，俺打心底里喜欢啊！”老大娘昌秀芝拉着战士的手，感激地说：“毛主席教育出来的战士，没啥说，就是好！”
