Japanese monopolistic enterprises are accelerating mergers with the open support of the reactionary Sato government. Recently, the three companies "Kawasaki Heavy Industries," "Kawasaki Aircraft," and "Kawasaki Rolling Stock," which belong to the old Kawasaki zaibatsu, announced their merger. At the same time, Yawata Steel and Fuji Steel also decided to merge. After the merger of Yawata and Fuji, the two major steel companies will monopolize 44% of crude steel production and more than 80% of rails and large steel materials.

Under the pressure of monopolistic enterprises accelerating mergers, Japanese small and medium-sized enterprises are being squeezed out. According to recent figures released by the Tokyo Chamber of Commerce and Industry, from January to June this year, 5,966 small and medium-sized enterprises went bankrupt, an increase of 57% compared to the same period last year.

    日垄断企业加紧合并中小企业倒闭
    在佐藤反动政府公开支持下，日本垄断企业正在加紧合并。不久前，旧川崎财阀系统的“川崎重工”、“川崎飞机”、“川崎车辆”三家公司宣告合并。同时，八幡制铁公司和富士制铁公司也决定合并。八幡和富士两大制铁公司合并之后，将垄断粗钢生产的百分之四十四，铁轨和大型钢材的百分之八十以上。
    在垄断企业加紧合并之下，日本中小企业纷纷被挤垮。据东京商工问讯所最近发表的数字，今年一月至六月，中小企业倒闭达五千九百六十六起，比去年同期增加了百分之五十七。
