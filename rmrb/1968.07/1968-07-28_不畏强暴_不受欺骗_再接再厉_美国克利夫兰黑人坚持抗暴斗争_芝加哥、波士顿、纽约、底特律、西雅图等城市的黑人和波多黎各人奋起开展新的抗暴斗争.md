Fearless Against Violence, Unyielding to Deception, Persevere

Cleveland's Black Youths Continue Their Struggle Against Violence

Blacks and Puerto Ricans in Chicago, Boston, New York, Detroit, and Seattle Launch New Struggles Against Violence

According to a report from the New China News Agency on the 26th, Washington: The black youth of Cleveland, Ohio, fearless against violence and unyielding to deception, continue their brave and tenacious struggle against violence. Meanwhile, blacks and Puerto Ricans in Boston, New York, Detroit, and Seattle have launched new struggles against violence, causing the U.S. reactionary ruling clique to panic.

The struggle against violence that Cleveland's blacks launched on the 23rd has turned much of the city's black neighborhoods into battlefields. Western bourgeois news agencies have exclaimed that this is the "most serious" struggle against violence since the nationwide struggle by U.S. blacks in April.

To extinguish the flames of this struggle against violence, the U.S. reactionary ruling clique has intensified its use of both brute force and deception. On the 24th, Ohio Governor Rhodes ruthlessly deployed 2,600 National Guardsmen to Cleveland to carry out bloody suppression. At the same time, the reactionary ruling clique used the black mayor of Cleveland, Stokes, to carry out deceptive plots. Stokes, on the one hand, shouted hoarsely for black residents to "cooperate with the police," "go home," and "stay home and lock the doors," while on the other hand, he pretended to order the National Guardsmen and white policemen to withdraw from the black neighborhoods, actually intending for these executioners to tightly encircle the black neighborhoods. Meanwhile, he sent 100 black policemen and 500 so-called black "community leaders" to undermine the fighting spirit of the blacks. However, the black masses of Cleveland, especially the black youth, neither fear the bayonets of the National Guardsmen nor listen to Stokes' sweet talk. They continue to pour into the streets in large numbers, smashing and burning the shops of white racists who usually exploit them.

Under the impact of the black masses, Stokes revealed his true face in less than 24 hours. On the 25th, he openly ordered a curfew in the black neighborhoods and brought the National Guardsmen and white policemen back in to brutally suppress the blacks. However, the fascist police and National Guardsmen, who were beaten back by the blacks of Cleveland, were trembling with fear as soon as they entered the black neighborhoods. They even dared not patrol in pairs but had to patrol in groups.

On the 25th evening, more than 1,000 black youth in Chicago rose up to fight against the white racist merchants. They stormed into a large food store, smashing its windows. At the same time, more than 350 black youth stormed into the town hall of Maywood, a suburb of Chicago, scaring the mayor, Albert, and other officials into fleeing in disarray. The black masses then bravely fought back against the police who came to suppress them. They picked up the tear gas canisters thrown at them and threw them back at the police.

In New York, the struggle by Puerto Ricans against the "Tactical Patrol Force" entering their neighborhood has entered its sixth day. Large numbers of Puerto Ricans on the rooftops of many buildings in the neighborhood pelted patrol cars with bricks and bottles, injuring several policemen, and set fire to two cars.

    不畏强暴　不受欺骗　再接再厉
    美国克利夫兰黑人坚持抗暴斗争
    芝加哥、波士顿、纽约、底特律、西雅图等城市的黑人和波多黎各人奋起开展新的抗暴斗争
    据新华社二十六日讯　华盛顿消息：美国克利夫兰市的黑人青年不畏强暴不受欺骗，继续英勇顽强地坚持抗暴斗争。与此同时，美国波士顿、纽约、底特律、西雅图等城市的黑人和波多黎各人，又开展了新的抗暴斗争，使得美国反动统治集团惊慌不安。
    克利夫兰市黑人二十三日晚掀起的抗暴斗争，使得这个城市的大部分黑人区成了战场。西方资产阶级通讯社惊呼，这是今年四月美国黑人进行全国大规模抗暴斗争以来“最严重的”一次抗暴斗争。
    为了扑灭这次抗暴斗争的火焰，美国反动统治集团加紧使用武力镇压和收买欺骗的反革命两手策略。俄亥俄州长罗兹二十四日悍然出动了二千六百名国民警卫队，开进克利夫兰市进行血腥镇压。同时反动统治集团又利用他们安插在克利夫兰市的黑人市长斯托克斯大搞欺骗的阴谋。这个斯托克斯一方面声嘶力竭地叫嚷要黑人居民“和警察合作”，“回家去”，“呆在家里，把门锁上”，另一方面又假惺惺地下令国民警卫队和白人警察全部撤出黑人区，实际上是要这些刽子手们把黑人区紧紧地包围起来，与此同时，他派出一百名黑人警察和五百名所谓黑人“民间领袖”去瓦解黑人的战斗情绪。但是克利夫兰市黑人群众，特别是黑人青年，既不怕国民警卫队的刺刀，也不听斯托克斯的甜言蜜语，他们仍然大批大批地涌上街头，把平时盘剥他们的白人种族主义者的商店砸个稀巴烂，并且放火把它们烧掉。
    在黑人群众的冲击下，这个斯托克斯在不到二十四小时的时间内就暴露出了他的狰狞面目。他在二十五日公然下令在黑人区实行宵禁，并把国民警卫队和白人警察重新开进了黑人区对黑人进行残酷的镇压。但是被克利夫兰黑人打得狼狈不堪的法西斯警察和国民警卫队，一进黑人区就胆战心惊，他们甚至不敢两人一起巡逻，而只得成群结队地巡逻。
    二十五日晚，芝加哥市一千余名黑人青年奋起大造白人种族主义商人的反，他们冲进了一家大食品商店，砸掉了这个商店的橱窗。与此同时，三百五十余名黑人青年，冲进了芝加哥郊区的梅伍德市的市政厅，吓得正在里面开会的市长艾伯特及其他官员狼狈逃窜。黑人群众接着又勇敢地迎战前来镇压的警察。他们拣起掷来的催泪弹向警察进行回击。
    在纽约，波多黎各人抗议“战术巡逻队”进驻这个区的斗争，二十五日已进入第六天。大批波多黎各人在这个区的许多屋顶上用砖块和瓶子狠砸巡逻车，砸伤好几名警察，并放火烧掉了两辆汽车。
