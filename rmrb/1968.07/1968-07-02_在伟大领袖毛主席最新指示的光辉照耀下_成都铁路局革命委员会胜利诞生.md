Under the brilliant guidance of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, the Chengdu Railway Bureau Revolutionary Committee has been born in triumph!

The revolutionary and production situation throughout the bureau is excellent. The struggle against the enemy continues to achieve new victories, and revolutionary committees have been established in many grassroots units. The average daily loading and unloading volumes in June were significantly higher than in May.

Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, July 1st: Under the brilliant guidance of Chairman Mao's latest instructions and the encouragement of the national railway and transportation conference personally approved by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, the Chengdu Railway Bureau Revolutionary Committee was born in triumph on the joyous occasion of the 47th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China and the 16th anniversary of the completion of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway, amidst the storm of class struggle! This is another great victory for Mao Zedong Thought and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

The Chengdu Railway Bureau is located in the strategic rear of socialist China and bears the important task of supporting the construction of the interior. In the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution initiated and led by Chairman Mao, the revolutionary masses and broad revolutionary workers of the entire bureau, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and with the strong support of the People's Liberation Army, have raised the revolutionary banner of "It is reasonable to rebel against the reactionaries" and launched a fierce attack on the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents, achieving decisive victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Currently, the revolutionary and production situation in the Chengdu Railway Bureau is excellent. In the intense struggle between the two classes, two lines, and two roads, revolutionary workers have established Mao Zedong Thought study classes, actively learned and applied Mao Zedong Thought, and conducted sustained and in-depth revolutionary criticism and self-criticism. Their awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines has greatly increased. They resolutely oppose right opportunism, right splitism, and right capitulationism, smash the rightist reversal wind, and firmly strike down a handful of class enemies. They have achieved new victories in the struggle against the enemy. Currently, two out of the four divisions of the Chengdu Railway Bureau have established revolutionary committees. The Guiyang Division and its subordinate units have all established revolutionary committees. Other divisions also have many grassroots units that have established revolutionary committees.

The excellent revolutionary situation has promoted production development. Revolutionary workers regard running an additional train as a way to express their loyalty to Chairman Mao and loading or unloading an additional ton of cargo as firing a shot at the class enemy. Production throughout the bureau has steadily increased. The average daily loading volume in June increased by 36% compared to May, the daily unloading volume increased by 48%, the daily cargo shipment increased by 37%, and the efficiency of locomotive repairs, line repairs, and other projects has also significantly improved.

On the morning of July 1st, representatives of the proletarian revolutionary masses and revolutionary workers from the Baocheng, Chengdu-Chongqing, and Sichuan-Guizhou lines gathered in Chengdu for a grand meeting to celebrate the glorious birth of the Chengdu Railway Bureau Revolutionary Committee.

Leaders from the Sichuan Provincial Revolutionary Committee and the Chengdu Military Region of the People's Liberation Army, including Zhang Guohua, Liang Xingchu, Liu Jietu, and Tianbao, as well as leaders from the Chengdu Municipal Revolutionary Committee and military representatives, attended the meeting to offer congratulations. Liang Xingchu and Liu Jietu, vice chairmen of the Sichuan Provincial Revolutionary Committee and leaders of the Chengdu Military Region of the People's Liberation Army, spoke at the meeting. They pointed out that after the establishment of the Chengdu Railway Bureau Revolutionary Committee, efforts must continue to promote the mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and continue to conduct sustained and in-depth revolutionary criticism. They must consolidate and develop the revolutionary great alliance and the revolutionary three-in-one combination. They must firmly grasp the direction of struggle, resolutely oppose right opportunism, right splitism, and right capitulationism, thoroughly smash the rightist reversal wind, and firmly strike down a handful of traitors, spies, unrepentant capitalist roaders, and other open and hidden counter-revolutionaries to further consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end. They hope that the proletarian revolutionary masses and broad revolutionary workers will seriously study the editorial in the "People's Daily," "Red Flag" magazine, and "Liberation Army Daily" on July 1st: "Carry Forward the Party's Tradition of Close Ties with the Masses." Members of the revolutionary committee must maintain the broadest, most frequent, and closest ties with the laboring people, go deep into the masses, be ordinary laborers, consult with the masses on all matters, actively participate in socialist production labor, and make the revolutionary committee deeply rooted among the masses, becoming a revolutionary, authoritative, and vigorous fighting command center of the proletariat.

Li Shiren, the chairman of the Chengdu Railway Bureau Revolutionary Committee, also spoke at the meeting. He stated that the proletarian revolutionary masses and broad revolutionary workers of the entire bureau must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, resolutely implement Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production, promote work, and promote preparedness," and advance along the path indicated by Chairman Mao.

The meeting, amidst thunderous applause, passed a telegram of respect to our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao.

    在伟大领袖毛主席最新指示的光辉照耀下
    成都铁路局革命委员会胜利诞生
    全局革命和生产形势一片大好。对敌斗争不断取得新胜利，大批基层单位建立了革委会。六月份平均日装车、卸车量，都比五月份有较大增长
    新华社成都一日电　在伟大领袖毛主席一系列最新指示的光辉照耀下，在毛主席和林副主席亲自批准召开的全国铁路、交通会议的鼓舞下，成都铁路局革命委员会在中国共产党成立四十七周年和成渝铁路通车十六周年的大喜日子里，在阶级斗争的暴风雨中胜利诞生了！这是毛泽东思想和毛主席无产阶级革命路线的又一重大胜利。
    成都铁路局处于社会主义祖国的战略后方，担负着支援内地建设的重要任务。在伟大领袖毛主席亲自发动和领导的史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命运动中，全局无产阶级革命派和广大革命职工，在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线指引下，在人民解放军的大力支持下，高举“对反动派造反有理”的革命大旗，向中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人发动了猛烈进攻，取得了无产阶级文化大革命的决定性胜利。
    目前，成都铁路局革命和生产形势一片大好。在激烈的两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的大搏斗中，广大革命职工大办毛泽东思想学习班，活学活用毛泽东思想，持久深入地开展革命大批判，斗私批修，阶级斗争和两条路线斗争的觉悟大大提高，他们坚决反对右倾机会主义、右倾分裂主义、右倾投降主义，粉碎右倾翻案妖风，稳、准、狠地打击一小撮阶级敌人，在对敌斗争中不断取得了新的胜利。目前，成都铁路局所属的四个分局中已有两个分局建立了革命委员会。贵阳分局及所属单位全部建立了革命委员会。其他分局也有大批基层单位建立了革命委员会。
    革命的大好形势推动了生产的发展。广大革命职工把多开一趟列车，看作是向毛主席多献一分忠心；把多装卸一吨货物，看做是对阶级敌人多发射一排炮弹。全局生产稳步上升。六月份平均日装车量比五月份增加百分之三十六，日卸车量比五月份增加百分之四十八，货物每天发送吨数比五月份增加百分之三十七，机车检修、线路大修等项工程的效率也大大提高。
    七月一日上午，来自宝成、成渝、川黔等线路的无产阶级革命派和革命职工的代表，在成都隆重集会，热烈庆祝成都铁路局革命委员会光荣诞生。
    四川省革命委员会和人民解放军成都部队负责人张国华、梁兴初、刘结挺、天宝同志，以及成都市革命委员会负责人和驻军代表等到会祝贺。四川省革命委员会副主任、人民解放军成都部队负责人梁兴初、刘结挺同志在大会上讲了话。他们指出，成都铁路局革命委员会建立以后，要继续大力开展活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动，全面落实毛主席的一系列最新指示，继续深入持久地开展革命的大批判，巩固和发展革命的大联合和革命的三结合。要牢牢掌握斗争大方向，坚决反对右倾机会主义、右倾分裂主义、右倾投降主义，彻底粉碎右倾翻案妖风，稳、准、狠地打击一小撮叛徒、特务、死不悔改的走资派及其他公开的、暗藏的反革命分子，进一步巩固无产阶级专政，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。他们希望无产阶级革命派和广大革命职工，认真学习《人民日报》、《红旗》杂志、《解放军报》“七一”社论：《发扬党的紧密联系群众的作风》。革委会成员要同劳动人民保持最广泛的、经常的、密切的联系，深入群众，作普通劳动者，遇事多和群众商量，积极参加社会主义生产劳动，使革委会深深地扎根于群众之中，成为革命的、有无产阶级权威的、朝气蓬勃的战斗指挥部。
    成都铁路局革委会主任李士荣同志在会上讲了话。他表示，全局无产阶级革命派和广大革命职工，要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，坚决贯彻执行毛主席“抓革命、促生产、促工作、促战备”的伟大方针，沿着毛主席指引的方向乘胜前进。
    大会在暴风雨般的掌声中通过了给我们最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席的致敬电。
