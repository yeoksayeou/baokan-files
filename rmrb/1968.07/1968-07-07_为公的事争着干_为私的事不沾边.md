For Public Matters, Eagerly Take on the Task;
For Private Matters, Stay Clear

Two years ago, we reclaimed twenty-five mu of land in a barren valley and, after battling drought to plant the seeds, all of it was sown with corn. However, as the busy season approached, labor became increasingly scarce. What should we do? We studied the "Three Articles." The militiamen said: These twenty-five mu of land were reclaimed with a spirit of devotion to the public good, and we will use this spirit to manage it well. The production team is short of labor, so we militiamen will volunteer and take it on! The young people said: We are a shock brigade, let us take the lead! The poor and lower-middle peasants said: We are the main force, let us take on this task! In this way, the cadres and the masses all eagerly took on the task of managing these twenty-five mu of cornfields as a battlefield to cultivate their spirit of devotion to the public good. As a result, from weeding to hoeing, and all the way to harvesting the corn and tilling the stubble, everyone voluntarily used their early mornings, evenings, and midday breaks to complete the work, without asking the team for a single work point. After the harvest, the poor and lower-middle peasants of Hongshimen all said: "From these twenty-five mu of land, we not only harvested grain, but also something more precious—a spirit of devotion to the public good and communism."

    为公的事争着干
    为私的事不沾边
    前年，我们在荒山沟新垫的二十五亩地，经过抗旱播种，全都种上了玉米。可是，随着大忙季节的到来，劳动力越来越不够用了。怎么办？我们学习了“老三篇”。民兵说：这二十五亩地，是我们用一心为公的革命精神垫起来的，我们要用一心为公的革命精神把它管理好，生产队劳力缺乏，我们民兵尽义务，把它包了！青年们说：我们是一支突击队，就让我们突击！贫下中农说：我们是主力军，这个任务，还是我们担了！就这样，干部和群众争着把这二十五亩地当成培育自己一心为公的革命精神的战场。结果，这二十五亩玉米地的田间管理，从间苗、锄草，一直到收玉米、刨玉米茬，都是大家自动利用早晚和中午的休息时间做完的，没有人要队里开一个工分。秋后，我们红石门的贫下中农都说：“从这二十五亩地里收获的，不光是粮食，还有比粮食更宝贵的一心为公的共产主义思想。”
