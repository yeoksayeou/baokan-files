Vietnamese newspapers *Nhan Dan* and *Quan Doi Nhan Dan* both published articles on the 22nd stating that the meeting between U.S. imperialist chief Johnson and the Saigon puppet Nguyen Van Thieu in Honolulu was a meeting to intensify the war of aggression against Vietnam.

The article in *Nhan Dan* said that Johnson summoned Nguyen Van Thieu to Honolulu to stage a farce, to put makeup on this lackey, and at the same time to force him to obey the master's orders.

The article pointed out that the current situation in South Vietnam is that the people of South Vietnam are fighting back against the U.S. aggressors, and the U.S. war of aggression is facing the danger of complete collapse.

The article pointed out that this Honolulu meeting was a meeting held by the U.S. bandits and their lackeys to rescue their failing cause. However, in Honolulu, the devils did not find any new "tricks" except to more clearly expose their warlike and stubborn nature.

The article in *Quan Doi Nhan Dan* pointed out that this Honolulu meeting shows that the White House bosses are still stubbornly insisting on staying in South Vietnam, deliberately carrying out the U.S. new colonialist policy of aggression, and at the same time more clearly exposing their helplessness and desperate situation. The article said that through this meeting, the U.S. bandits are plotting to further intensify their new colonialist war of aggression, while at the same time trying to deceive with "peace." However, no war measures can threaten our people, and no cunning plots can deceive our compatriots.

The article said that in the face of the U.S. bandits' sinister plots, the people of South Vietnam will further strengthen their attacks and ultimately achieve complete victory.

    越南报纸严正揭露约翰逊阮文绍会谈丑剧
    檀香山会议是强化侵越战争的会议
    美帝阴谋在强化侵略战争的同时竭力进行“和平”欺骗
    新华社河内二十三日电　越南《人民报》和《人民军队报》二十二日分别发表文章指出，美帝国主义头子约翰逊和西贡傀儡阮文绍在檀香山举行的会议，是一次强化侵越战争的会议。
    《人民报》的文章说，约翰逊把阮文绍召到檀香山，是为了上演一出丑剧，给这个奴才涂脂抹粉，同时强迫他要听从主子的旨意。
    文章指出，目前越南南方的形势是：面对越南南方军民的进攻和奋起斗争，美国的侵略战争正面临着彻底崩溃的危机。
    文章指出，这次檀香山会议是美国强盗及其走狗为了挽救他们的失败而举行的一次会议。但是在檀香山，魔鬼们除了更加清楚地暴露了他们的好战和顽固面目之外，找不到什么新“法宝”。
    《人民军队报》的文章指出，这次檀香山会议表明了白宫的头子们仍然顽固地要死赖在越南南方，蓄意推行美国的新殖民主义侵略政策，同时也更加暴露了它的无能为力和绝望处境。文章说，美国强盗通过这次会议，阴谋进一步强化他们的新殖民主义侵略战争，同时竭力进行“和平”欺骗。但是，任何战争措施都威胁不了我国人民，任何狡诈阴谋都欺骗不了我国同胞。
    文章说，面对美国强盗的不可告人的阴谋，越南南方人民将进一步加强进攻，进而夺取彻底胜利。
