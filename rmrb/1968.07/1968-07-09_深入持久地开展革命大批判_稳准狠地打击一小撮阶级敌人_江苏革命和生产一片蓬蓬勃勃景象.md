Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, the revolutionary committees at all levels in Jiangsu have carried forward the spirit of thorough proletarian revolution, closely linked with the masses, and firmly relied on the masses to deeply and persistently carry out revolutionary criticism. They have firmly, accurately, and resolutely struck at a small handful of class enemies, thereby continuously consolidating and developing the newly born revolutionary committees. The entire province presents a vibrant revolutionary scene.

From late March to the end of June, in just over three months, all seven prefectures and five municipalities directly under the province have established revolutionary committees. More than 80% of the counties and more than 90% of the people's communes have established revolutionary committees. Most grassroots units in industry, mines, enterprises, and schools have also established revolutionary committees.

The revolutionary committees at all levels in Jiangsu were born in the midst of the stormy waves of class struggle and have been continuously consolidated and developed in these waves. The revolutionary committees at all levels have followed Chairman Mao's teaching that "all revolutionary struggles in the world are for the purpose of seizing power and consolidating power." They have raised the banner of revolutionary criticism of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, leading the broad revolutionary masses to launch a fierce attack on China's Khrushchev and a handful of the biggest capitalist-roaders within the Party, as well as their agents in Jiangsu, Jiang Weiqing, Chen Guang, and their ilk. Through extensive and in-depth revolutionary criticism, the heinous crimes of a small handful of class enemies in trying to reverse the verdict and sabotage the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Jiangsu have been thoroughly exposed, further laying bare their ugly faces in broad daylight.

Recently, Chairman Mao profoundly pointed out: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is, in essence, a great political revolution carried out by the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes under the conditions of socialism. It is a continuation of the long-term struggle between the Communist Party of China and the Kuomintang reactionaries led by the broad revolutionary masses, and a continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie." Chairman Mao's latest instruction has greatly inspired and educated the members of the revolutionary committees at all levels in Jiangsu. They have taken Chairman Mao's great instruction as an educational and arming tool for the masses to attack class enemies. Under the leadership of the revolutionary committees at all levels, the entire province has launched a wave of establishing Mao Zedong Thought study classes, using them as large classrooms to implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions. From cities to rural areas, from factories, offices, and schools to streets and households, in various industries and systems, by the end of June, tens of thousands of various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes have been held, with over 20 million people participating. Through the establishment of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions have been fully implemented, continuously raising the great mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought to a new level and elevating the revolutionization of people's thinking to a new height.

Following Chairman Mao's instruction to "boldly guide the movement and not be afraid of dragons in front or tigers behind," the leading members of the revolutionary committees at all levels in Jiangsu have dared to take the lead and boldly guide the movement. They have mobilized the masses, actively guided the masses, and firmly relied on the masses to lead the masses to take the initiative to attack class enemies. They have realized from the struggle that whether to be bold or timid is essentially a struggle between two worldviews of public and private, a matter of loyalty to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. In terms of thought, being selfless, and in terms of work guidance, always grasping the main contradiction and firmly holding the direction of the struggle, nothing will be feared. In the fierce class struggle, the members of the revolutionary committees at all levels have always been on the front line, breathing and sharing destiny with the masses, serving both as commanders and fighters, fighting alongside the masses. Except for necessary duty personnel, most members of the revolutionary committees at all levels have gone to the grassroots to conduct in-depth investigations. The leading members of the provincial revolutionary committee have taken the lead to go among the masses. After going to the grassroots, they have studied and analyzed the new trends, new characteristics, and new problems of class struggle with the members of the revolutionary committees and revolutionary masses of the units they are in, jointly launching fierce attacks on class enemies, continuously helping the grassroots revolutionary committees to summarize experiences, and humbly learning from the grassroots revolutionary committees and revolutionary masses. In the fierce class struggle, the revolutionary committees at all levels have become vigorous command centers leading the broad revolutionary masses to launch fierce attacks on class enemies.

While leading the broad revolutionary masses to launch fierce attacks on class enemies, the revolutionary committees at all levels in Jiangsu have resolutely implemented Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, wholeheartedly protecting the broad masses of the people, and fiercely striking at a small handful of class enemies. They have always boldly stood at the forefront of the mass movement, arming the masses with the Party's policies and strategies, guiding the masses to correctly distinguish between two types of contradictions, and ensuring that the mass movement of fiercely attacking a small handful of class enemies advances along the track of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Because Chairman Mao's latest instructions and the Party's policies have armed the masses, the masses know clearly who to strike, who to win over, who to unite with, and who to help. Therefore, all revolutionary forces that can be united have been united, and a small handful of class enemies have been firmly, accurately, and resolutely struck.

Under the leadership of the revolutionary committees, the revolutionary masses in various places have closely combined the work of cleaning up class ranks with revolutionary criticism. They have used the class enemies unearthed in their units as living materials, exposing one crime of the enemy, studying one instruction from Chairman Mao, criticizing one fallacy of China's Khrushchev, and eliminating one aspect of poison. In this way, the broad revolutionary masses have seen, touched, recognized, and deeply hated the crimes of China's Khrushchev in restoring capitalism, and criticized them thoroughly. Nowadays, in Jiangsu Province, from offices and schools to factories and rural areas, everywhere is a battlefield of revolutionary criticism, and a small handful of class enemies are increasingly isolated.

"Class struggle, once grasped, works wonders." The revolutionary situation has brought about a good production situation. The industrial output value of the entire province has been rising month by month. The total industrial output value in the second quarter has increased by more than 60% compared to the first quarter. The summer crops have been harvested, and efforts are being made to increase production in the autumn. In the rural people's communes, due to the fierce criticism of China's Khrushchev and his agents on the issue of grain distribution, the relationship between the state, the collective, and the individual has been correctly handled, and the summer grain delivery task has been completed quickly and well.

At present, the revolutionary committees at all levels in Jiangsu are advancing with the momentum of victory, leading the broad revolutionary masses to launch an even fiercer attack on class enemies and strive for a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

    深入持久地开展革命大批判　稳准狠地打击一小撮阶级敌人
    江苏革命和生产一片蓬蓬勃勃景象
    各级革命委员会在阶级斗争的大风大浪中普遍诞生，并得到不断巩固和发展。工业产值逐月上升，农业夏熟作物获得丰收
    新华社南京八日电在伟大领袖毛主席一系列最新指示的指引下，江苏各级革命委员会发扬无产阶级彻底革命的精神，紧密联系群众，坚决依靠群众，深入持久地开展革命大批判，稳、准、狠地打击一小撮阶级敌人，从而使新生的革命委员会不断得到巩固和发展，全省出现一片蓬蓬勃勃的革命景象。
    从三月下旬到六月底的短短三个多月里，全省七个专区、五个省辖市，已经全部成立了革命委员会；百分之八十以上的县和百分之九十以上的人民公社，都成立了革命委员会；工矿、企业、学校等大多数基层单位，也成立了革命委员会。
    江苏省的各级革委会在阶级斗争大风大浪中诞生，又在阶级斗争大风大浪中不断巩固和发展。各级革命委员会遵循伟大领袖毛主席“世界上一切革命斗争都是为着夺取政权，巩固政权”的教导，更高地举起毛泽东思想的革命批判大旗，带领广大革命群众，向中国赫鲁晓夫等党内一小撮最大的走资派及其在江苏的代理人江渭清、陈光之流，发动了猛烈的进攻。广泛深入地开展革命大批判的结果，充分揭露了一小撮阶级敌人大刮右倾翻案妖风，妄图破坏江苏无产阶级文化大革命的滔天罪行，把他们的丑恶嘴脸进一步暴露在光天化日之下。
    伟大领袖毛主席最近深刻地指出：“无产阶级文化大革命，实质上是在社会主义条件下，无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命，是中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续，是无产阶级和资产阶级阶级斗争的继续。”毛主席这一最新指示，极大地鼓舞和教育了江苏省各级革命委员会成员。他们把毛主席的这一伟大指示作为教育群众、武装群众，向阶级敌人进攻的最强大的思想武器。在各级革委会领导下，全省各地掀起了大办毛泽东思想学习班的热潮，将学习班作为落实毛主席最新指示的大课堂。从城市到农村，从工厂、机关、学校到街道、家庭，各行业、各系统，到六月底为止已举办了各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班几十万期，参加学习的达二千多万人次。通过大办毛泽东思想学习班，全面落实毛主席的一系列最新指示，不断地把活学活用毛泽东思想的伟大群众运动提高到新的水平，把人的思想革命化提到新的高度。
    遵照毛主席“要大胆指导运动，不要前怕龙，后怕虎”的教导，江苏省各级革委会领导成员敢字当头，大胆领导运动。他们放手发动群众，积极引导群众，坚决依靠群众，带领群众坚决向阶级敌人主动出击。他们从斗争中体会到，“敢”字当头还是“怕”字当头，实质上就是公与私两种世界观的斗争，是对毛主席无产阶级革命路线忠不忠的问题。在思想上无私，在工作指导上始终抓住主要矛盾，牢牢掌握斗争大方向，就什么都不怕。各级革委会成员在激烈的阶级斗争中，始终站在第一线，和群众同呼吸，共命运，既当指挥员，又当战斗员，跟群众一起战斗。除必要的值班人员外，各级革委会的大多数成员都分别去基层蹲点，省革委会的领导成员首先带头到群众中去。他们到基层以后，同所在单位革委会成员和革命群众一起研究分析阶级斗争的新动向、新特点、新问题，一起向阶级敌人发动猛烈进攻，不断帮助基层革委会总结经验，虚心向基层革委会和革命群众学习。在激烈的阶级斗争中，各级革委会成为率领广大革命群众向阶级敌人猛烈进攻的朝气蓬勃的战斗指挥部。
    江苏各级革委会在带领广大革命群众向阶级敌人猛烈进攻的时候，坚决贯彻执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，满腔热情地保护广大人民群众，狠狠地打击一小撮阶级敌人。他们始终大胆地站在群众运动的前面，用党的政策和策略武装群众，引导群众正确区分两类不同性质的矛盾，使向一小撮阶级敌人猛烈进攻的群众运动沿着毛主席革命路线的轨道乘胜前进。由于毛主席的最新指示和党的政策武装了群众，群众对于打击谁，争取谁，团结谁，帮助谁，都心中有数，因而团结了一切可以团结的革命力量，稳、准、狠地打击了一小撮阶级敌人。
    各地革命群众在革委会的领导下，将清理阶级队伍的工作和革命大批判紧密结合起来。他们把本单位挖出来的阶级敌人当作活材料，揭发敌人一条罪状，学习一条毛主席的指示，批判中国赫鲁晓夫一个谬论，肃清一个方面的流毒。这样，就使广大革命群众对中国赫鲁晓夫复辟资本主义的罪行看得见，摸得着，认得清，恨得深，批得透。现在，江苏全省从机关、学校到工厂、农村，到处是革命大批判的战场，一小撮阶级敌人正陷入越来越孤立的境地。
    “阶级斗争，一抓就灵。”革命的大好形势带来了生产的大好形势。全省工业产值逐月上升，第二季度工业总产值比第一季度增加百分之六十以上；农业夏熟作物获得丰收，正在争取秋季增产。农村人民公社生产队，由于狠批了中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人在粮食分配问题上散布的一系列反革命修正主义黑货，正确处理了国家、集体、个人三者关系，今年夏粮交售任务完成得又快又好。
    目前，江苏各级革委会正在乘胜前进，带领广大革命群众向阶级敌人展开更加猛烈的进攻，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
