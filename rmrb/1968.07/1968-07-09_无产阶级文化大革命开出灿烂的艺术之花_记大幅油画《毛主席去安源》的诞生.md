In the midst of the triumphant songs of the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, another brilliant flower blooming with the radiant light of Mao Zedong Thought in proletarian literature and art— the large oil painting “Chairman Mao Goes to Anyuan”—has been born triumphantly!

The large oil painting “Chairman Mao Goes to Anyuan” takes us back to the autumn of forty-seven years ago. Our great leader Chairman Mao, bearing the weight of the Chinese revolution and the hopes of the Chinese nation, strides forward with his head held high amidst the swirling clouds, ascending Anyuan Mountain. A radiant red sun rises, casting its brilliant light over the land of our motherland.

The large oil painting “Chairman Mao Goes to Anyuan” is a vivid portrayal of our great leader Chairman Mao personally going to Anyuan to initiate the proletarian revolutionary movement. It successfully captures the radiant image of the great teacher Chairman Mao. The leading comrades of the Central Cultural Revolution Group highly praised this excellent work upon discovering it. The broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers burst into joyous cheers and spread the news upon seeing this excellent work. How many people stood before this painting, raising their fists and shouting, “Long live Chairman Mao, the reddest red sun in our hearts! Ten thousand years, ten thousand ten thousand years!” How many people enthusiastically praised, “This is an unprecedented achievement of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution! This is another victory for Chairman Mao’s revolutionary line in literature and art!”

The large oil painting “Chairman Mao Goes to Anyuan” was collectively created by a group of revolutionary Red Guards and young revolutionary students from Beijing institutions, with Liu Chunhua as the principal artist. Many of them had never held a brush before, and Liu Chunhua, at just twenty-four years old, was a student in the Decorative Arts Department of the Central Academy of Arts and Crafts, with no specialized training in oil painting. From the start of painting on the canvas to its completion, it took only over a month, and from conception to completion, it took only over two months. Such a group of young people, in such a short time, creating such a proletarian artistic treasure, is a miracle.

The birth of this artistic treasure vividly proves a great truth: the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by our great leader Chairman Mao, has greatly aroused the revolutionary spirit and wisdom of the Chinese people. It shows that as long as one grasps Mao Zedong Thought, revolutionary people can create any miracle!

“For the sake of sacrifice, dare to teach the sun and moon to renew the sky.” More than forty years ago, the three mountains of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism weighed heavily on the Chinese people, the country was in its worst state, and society was in its darkest hour. The Chinese people refused to be slaves; the Chinese people wanted liberation. The land of China was filled with kindling, and the flames of revolution were about to ignite. A thunderous roar echoed through the sky, and in 1921, the Communist Party of China was founded! That autumn, Anyuan Mountain echoed with joyous cheers, and the waters of Ping River sang loudly! A great historical moment had arrived! Our great teacher Chairman Mao, with the courage of the greatest proletarian revolutionary leader of the contemporary era, came to Anyuan, personally initiating this source of the Chinese workers’ revolutionary movement. From then on, the red sun shone over the Anyuan mining area. Chairman Mao sowed the seeds of revolution in Anyuan, opening a new and magnificent chapter in the history of the Chinese revolution. Chairman Mao personally initiated and led the great strike of over seventeen thousand railway and mining workers in Anyuan, achieving a great victory; Chairman Mao personally deployed the world-shaking Autumn Harvest Uprising in Anyuan, organizing Anyuan workers to participate in this great armed struggle; Chairman Mao taught the Anyuan workers to follow the only correct revolutionary path of “seizing political power by force,” achieving one great victory after another.

“From the moment the wind rises from the earth, there are heroes born from the piles of white bones.” Just after our great leader Chairman Mao opened up Anyuan as the source of the Chinese workers’ revolutionary movement, the Chinese Khrushchev, seizing the opportunity of revolution, infiltrated the Anyuan mining area in September 1922, fiercely opposing Chairman Mao’s revolutionary line, committing a series of counter-revolutionary crimes. However, for many years, this great traitor and great scoundrel shamelessly claimed credit for himself, boasting that he was the “leader of the Anyuan labor movement,” gathering a group of ghosts and snakes, using various forms of art to erect monuments to himself, and blackening the history of the Chinese Khrushchev in Anyuan, which is how this big black painting was created.

The revolutionary history of Anyuan cannot be allowed to be arbitrarily distorted by the Chinese Khrushchev! The proletarian art front cannot allow the big black painting of the Chinese Khrushchev in Anyuan to occupy it for a single day! No! No! Absolutely not!

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by our great leader Chairman Mao, like a volcanic eruption, burned away the “old revolutionary” mask of the Chinese Khrushchev. The hundreds of millions of military and civilian people across the country have an intense hatred for the heinous crimes of the Chinese Khrushchev; they are extremely angry at the shameless acts of this great traitor and great scoundrel in distorting the revolutionary history of Anyuan.

The hundreds of millions of military and civilian people across the country, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, fiercely criticized the Chinese Khrushchev, igniting the blazing flames of revolutionary criticism. The revolutionary Red Guards and young revolutionary students from Beijing institutions took up their brushes as weapons, bravely charging onto the battlefield of revolutionary criticism. They gathered together, determined to restore the original true face of the history of the Chinese labor movement, letting the revolutionary history of Anyuan shine with its inherent glory. Starting in July 1967, this group of revolutionary pioneers began the collective creation of the large oil painting “Chairman Mao Goes to Anyuan.”

The great revolutionary practice of our great leader Chairman Mao going to Anyuan educated the revolutionary Red Guards and young revolutionary students from Beijing institutions, and the great achievements of our great leader Chairman Mao in Anyuan inspired them. They yearned to use the art form of oil painting to truly depict the great historical event of Chairman Mao going to Anyuan and to perfectly capture the radiant image of Chairman Mao.

As revolutionary art workers, what could be more glorious than enthusiastically praising the great achievements of our great teacher Chairman Mao? What could be more fortunate than successfully depicting the radiant image of our great leader Chairman Mao?

To realize this noble wish, these pioneers on the art front, following Chairman Mao’s teachings: “The revolutionary writers and artists of China, the writers and artists with a future, must go among the masses, must go among the workers, peasants, and soldiers for a long time, unconditionally and wholeheartedly, to observe, experience, study, and analyze all people, all classes, all masses, all lively forms of life and struggle, all original materials for literature and art, and then it will be possible to enter the creative process.” They immediately set out for Anyuan in early July 1967, deeply studying Chairman Mao’s great revolutionary practice in Anyuan and feeling the proletarian sentiments of the Anyuan workers’ boundless love for Chairman Mao. In Anyuan, the old workers happily recounted to them the revolutionary life of Chairman Mao in Anyuan back then. Chairman Mao, wearing a half-worn blue cotton gown, holding an umbrella, and wearing cloth shoes, traversed mountains and rivers, walking to Anyuan. As soon as Chairman Mao arrived in Anyuan, he visited thatched huts and went down into the mines, sitting knee-to-knee with the workers, teaching them to rise up in revolution, smash the chains of the old society, and build a new world where workers are masters. From then on, the red sun rose in the hearts of the Anyuan workers. These new soldiers on the art front, seeing the mountains and waters that Chairman Mao had once visited, and hearing the old Anyuan workers recounting Chairman Mao’s words and deeds here, were even more inspired with boundless love and deep respect for our great leader Chairman Mao. Through the tempering of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and deep immersion in life in Anyuan, their deep proletarian sentiments of love for our great leader Chairman Mao have never been as pure and deep as they are today!

To realize this noble wish, these pioneers on the art front, diligently studied Chairman Mao’s works, and meticulously collected materials on Chairman Mao’s great revolutionary activities in his youth. “Just like young students in their prime, with youthful vigor and unbridled spirit; pointing at the rivers and mountains, inspiring words and deeds, treating the nobles of that time as dung.” Reading the brilliant poems of our great leader Chairman Mao, the radiant image of Chairman Mao in his youth stood tall before them. The more they studied Chairman Mao’s works, the closer they felt to Chairman Mao, the more loyal they became to Chairman Mao, and they couldn’t help but sing over and over again:

“The East is red, the sun is rising, China has given birth to Mao Zedong…”

The large oil painting “Chairman Mao Goes to Anyuan” was not created in a calm environment. In the process of creation, it underwent a fierce struggle between two diametrically opposed literary and artistic lines.

Since the founding of the country, the counter-revolutionary revisionist black line has dominated our politics in the field of literature and art. A handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists in the literary and artistic circles, under the instructions of their black backer the Chinese Khrushchev, fiercely suppressed revolutionary art workers from depicting the radiant image of Chairman Mao, and even more so, they did not allow unknown “little people” like those from Beijing institutions to depict the radiant image of Chairman Mao.

The broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers had the strongest desire for revolutionary art workers to create works depicting the radiant image of Chairman Mao. During the creation of the large oil painting “Chairman Mao Goes to Anyuan,” they firmly supported these new soldiers on the art front, enthusiastically encouraged them, and offered many valuable suggestions. Especially some old workers who had participated in the great strike of the Anyuan railway and mining workers personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao, voluntarily served as consultants for their creation.

However, a handful of class enemies harshly criticized these new soldiers on the art front for creating this oil painting, and some people poured cold water on them, saying things like “your skills are too poor.” This alerted the new soldiers on the art front. They held the red “Talks at the Yan’an Forum on Literature and Art,” studying it seriously. The teachings of our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out the most correct direction for them:

“Our literature and art are for the people, primarily for the workers, peasants, and soldiers, created for the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and used by the workers, peasants, and soldiers.”

Why does our great leader Chairman Mao teach us so earnestly, and why do the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers encourage us so enthusiastically, while some people criticize us like this? They realized that around the most fundamental question of for whom literature and art are created, a struggle between two lines on the art front is taking place here. We—Chairman Mao’s new soldiers on the art front—have an infinitely deep proletarian sentiment for Chairman Mao, and the guidance of Chairman Mao’s proletarian revolutionary line in literature and art. We have boundless power and can scale the peaks of proletarian literature and art. To use “skills” as an excuse to obstruct and intimidate us, to make us put down our brushes, this is absolutely not possible, not in a thousand ways, not in ten thousand ways! We—Chairman Mao’s new soldiers on the art front—are determined to create for the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and to satisfy the most urgent needs of hundreds of millions of revolutionary people by painting the radiant image of our great leader Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao’s proletarian revolutionary line in literature and art, we will definitely follow! The radiant image of Chairman Mao, we will definitely paint!

In the arduous process of creation, these new soldiers on the art front, how many times were they immersed in happy thoughts, how many times did they explore the most perfect composition. With their boundless love for Chairman Mao, they repeatedly discussed seriously, finally adopting the composition and coloring that have now been successfully created. Everyone felt that such a composition and coloring could most concentratedly, most prominently, and most vividly depict the radiant image of Chairman Mao.

The day of starting to paint on the canvas arrived, and the artist Liu Chunhua was so excited! For many years, this son of a poor peasant had collected a thick book of Chairman Mao’s photos, hoping that one day he could paint a large oil painting to depict the radiant image of Chairman Mao, the reddest red sun in our hearts. This happiest day has finally arrived! With the most sincere and profound proletarian sentiments for Chairman Mao, and with deep hatred for the Chinese Khrushchev, he worked day and night to create this painting. In August, that was the most intense time for him to paint, for many days he couldn’t sleep, for many times he couldn’t eat. Under the scorching sun of summer, the hall was hot like a steamer. During the day, he painted in sweat; at night, he couldn’t suppress his eager heart, standing before the canvas for a long time, pondering and examining, wanting to pour his deepest sentiments for Chairman Mao onto the canvas.

The moment of victory arrived! Amidst the triumphant songs of the decisive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution by the hundreds of millions of military and civilian people across the country, on the eve of the eighteenth anniversary of the founding of our great People’s Republic of China in 1967, the large oil painting “Chairman Mao Goes to Anyuan” was finally created successfully.

Chairman Mao’s proletarian revolutionary line guided the successful creation of the large oil painting “Chairman Mao Goes to Anyuan”!

Revolutionary art workers will forever march forward bravely along Chairman Mao’s proletarian revolutionary line!

“Navigating the sea relies on the helmsman, making revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought.” Looking back on the victorious process of creation over two months, they were surging with emotion, their blood boiling, shouting over and over again:

“Long live the victory of Chairman Mao’s proletarian revolutionary line!”

“Long live the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!”

“Long live our great leader Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years, ten thousand ten thousand years!”

    无产阶级文化大革命开出灿烂的艺术之花
    ——记大幅油画《毛主席去安源》的诞生
    在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的凯歌声中，无产阶级文艺的又一支闪烁着毛泽东思想灿烂光辉的鲜花——大幅油画《毛主席去安源》，胜利诞生了！
    大幅油画《毛主席去安源》，把我们带到了四十七年前的秋天。我们的伟大领袖毛主席，担着中国革命的重担，背负中华民族的希望，在乱云飞渡中，昂首阔步，踏上了安源山。一轮喷薄而出的红太阳，以无比灿烂的光辉，照亮了祖国大地。
    大幅油画《毛主席去安源》，是我们伟大统帅毛主席亲自去安源开拓无产阶级革命运动的生动写照，成功地刻画出伟大导师毛主席的光辉形象。中央文革领导同志一发现这幅优秀作品，就给予高度的评价。广大工农兵群众一看到这幅优秀作品，就纵情欢呼，奔走相告。多少人在这幅画前振臂高呼：“我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席万岁！万万岁！”多少人热烈赞扬：“这是史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命的又一丰硕成果！这是毛主席革命文艺路线的又一新胜利！”
    大幅油画《毛主席去安源》，是由北京院校一批革命的红卫兵小将和年青的革命师生集体创作，刘春华执笔的。他们当中的许多人从未挥笔作过画，刘春华也只有二十四岁，是中央工艺美术学院装潢系的学生，并未专门学习过油画。这幅画从上画布到画成，只用了一个多月，从构思到创作完成，也不过用了两个多月。这样的一批年青人，用这样短的时间，创作成功这样一幅无产阶级的艺术珍品，这是一个奇迹。
    这幅艺术珍品的诞生，极其生动地证明了一个伟大的真理：我们伟大领袖毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命，最大地激发了我国人民的革命魄力和智慧。它说明，只要掌握了毛泽东思想，革命人民就可以创造出任何人间奇迹！
    “为有牺牲多壮志，敢教日月换新天。”四十多年前，帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义三座大山沉重地压在中国人民的身上，国家坏到了极处，社会黑暗到了极处。中国人民不甘做奴隶，中国人民要解放。中国的大地到处布满了干柴，革命的烈火很快就要燃烧起来。一声惊雷震天响，一九二一年，中国共产党宣告成立了！这一年秋天，安源山在纵情欢呼，萍河水在放声歌唱！一个伟大的历史时刻来到了！我们的伟大导师毛主席以当代最伟大的无产阶级革命领袖的魄力，来到了安源，亲自开拓这一中国工人革命运动的发源地。从此，红太阳照亮了安源矿区。毛主席在安源播下了革命的火种，揭开了中国革命史上又一伟大壮丽的新篇章。毛主席亲自发动和领导了安源一万七千多路（铁路）矿（煤矿）工人大罢工，取得了伟大胜利；毛主席亲自在安源部署了震撼世界的秋收起义，组织安源工人参加这一伟大的武装斗争；毛主席教导安源工人走上了“武装夺取政权”的唯一正确的革命道路，夺取一个又一个伟大胜利。
      “一从大地起风雷，便有精生白骨堆。”就在我们伟大领袖毛主席开辟了安源这一中国工人革命运动发源地以后，中国赫鲁晓夫投革命之机，一九二二年九月钻进安源矿区，极力对抗毛主席的革命路线，干了一系列的反革命的罪恶勾当。但是，多年以来，这个大叛徒、大工贼，却贪天之功为己功，无耻地吹嘘他是什么“安源工运的领袖”，搜罗一批牛鬼蛇神，利用各种文艺形式，来为自己树碑立传，大黑画中国赫鲁晓夫在安源，就是这样炮制出笼的。
    安源的革命历史，岂能容中国赫鲁晓夫肆意篡改？！无产阶级美术阵地上，怎能让大黑画中国赫鲁晓夫在安源盘踞一日？！不能！不能！决不能！
    伟大领袖毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命运动，犹如火山爆发，焚毁了中国赫鲁晓夫“老革命”的画皮。全国亿万军民对于中国赫鲁晓夫的滔天罪行，无比仇恨；对于这个大叛徒、大工贼篡改安源革命历史的无耻行径，无比愤怒。
    举国上下亿万军民高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫，燃起了革命大批判的熊熊烈火。北京院校的这批革命的红卫兵小将和年青的革命师生，拿起画笔作刀枪，勇敢地杀上了革命大批判的战场。他们聚集在一起，立志要恢复中国工运历史原来的真正面目，让安源革命历史放出它固有的光辉。从一九六七年七月起，这批革命闯将开始了集体创作大幅油画《毛主席去安源》的战斗。
    伟大领袖毛主席去安源的伟大革命实践，教育着北京院校的这批革命的红卫兵小将和年青的革命师生，伟大领袖毛主席去安源的丰功伟绩，激励着他们。他们渴望着能用油画这一艺术形式，真实地把毛主席去安源的伟大历史事件表现出来，完美地把毛主席的伟大光辉形象刻画出来。
    作为革命的美术工作者，还有什么能比热情地歌颂我们伟大导师毛主席的丰功伟绩更光荣？！还有什么能比成功地描绘我们伟大领袖毛主席的光辉形象更幸福？！
    为了实现这一崇高的愿望，这些美术战线上的闯将，遵照毛主席的教导：“中国的革命的文学家艺术家，有出息的文学家艺术家，必须到群众中去，必须长期地无条件地全心全意地到工农兵群众中去，到火热的斗争中去，到唯一的最广大最丰富的源泉中去，观察、体验、研究、分析一切人，一切阶级，一切群众，一切生动的生活形式和斗争形式，一切文学和艺术的原始材料，然后才有可能进入创作过程。”他们一开始就在一九六七年七月初奔赴安源，深入学习毛主席在安源的伟大革命实践，体会安源工人对毛主席无限热爱的无产阶级感情。在安源，老工人们幸福地向他们忆述了毛主席当年在安源的战斗生活。毛主席身穿半旧蓝布长衫，手拿雨伞，脚登布鞋，跋山涉水，步行来到安源。毛主席一到安源，就串茅棚，下矿井，和工人促膝谈心，教导他们起来革命，砸碎旧社会的锁链，建立工人当家作主的新世界。从此，安源工人心中升起了红太阳。这些美术战线上的新兵，看着毛主席曾经到过的一山一水、一屋一井，听着安源老工人讲述的毛主席在这里的一事一语，更加激起了他们对伟大领袖毛主席的无限热爱、无限崇敬。经过无产阶级文化大革命锻炼，经过在安源的深入生活，他们热爱伟大领袖毛主席的深厚无产阶级感情，从来没有今天这样的纯，从来没有今天这样的深！
    为了实现崇高的愿望，这些美术战线的闯将，努力学习毛主席著作，详细搜集毛主席青年时代进行伟大革命活动的材料。“恰同学少年，风华正茂；书生意气，挥斥方遒。指点江山，激扬文字，粪土当年万户侯。”读着伟大领袖毛主席这辉煌诗篇，毛主席青年时代神采奕奕的光辉形象，巍然屹立在他们的面前。他们越学习毛主席著作对毛主席越亲，越学习对毛主席越忠，他们情不自禁地一遍又一遍高唱：
      “东方红，太阳升，中国出了个毛泽东……。”
    大幅油画《毛主席去安源》，并不是在风平浪静中创作的。它在创作过程中，经历了两条截然对立的文艺路线的激烈斗争。
    建国以来，反革命修正主义文艺黑线专了我们的政。文艺界的一小撮反革命修正主义分子，在他们的黑后台中国赫鲁晓夫指使下，疯狂地压制革命的美术工作者描绘毛主席的光辉形象，更不许象北京院校这样一批不知名的“小人物”来描绘毛主席的光辉形象。
    广大的工农兵群众，最强烈地渴望革命的美术工作者创作出描绘毛主席光辉形象的作品。就在大幅油画《毛主席去安源》的创作过程中，他们坚决地支持这些美术战线的新兵，热情地鼓励他们，给他们提出了许多宝贵的意见。特别是一些曾经参加过毛主席亲自发动和领导的安源路矿工人大罢工的老工人，还主动地给他们当创作顾问。
    但是，一小撮阶级敌人对这些美术战线的新兵创作这幅油画横加指责，也有些人给他们泼冷水，说什么“你们的技术太差”。这使美术战线的新兵引起了警觉。他们手捧红彤彤的《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》，认真地进行学习。伟大领袖毛主席的教导，给他们指明了最正确的方向：
      “我们的文学艺术都是为人民大众的，首先是为工农兵的，为工农兵而创作，为工农兵所利用的。”
    为什么伟大领袖毛主席这样谆谆教导我们，广大的工农兵这样热情的鼓励我们，而有些人却这样的指责我们呢？他们认识到，围绕着文艺究竟为什么人这个最根本的问题，这里进行着一场文艺战线上的两条路线的斗争。我们——毛主席的美术战线上的新兵，有对毛主席无限深厚的无产阶级感情，有毛主席的无产阶级革命文艺路线的指引，我们就有无穷无尽的力量，就可以攀登无产阶级文艺的高峰。想借口什么“技术”来阻挠我们，吓唬我们，要我们搁下画笔，这一千个办不到，一万个办不到！我们——毛主席的美术战线上的新兵，就是要为工农兵而创作，就是要为着满足亿万革命人民最最迫切的需要，画出我们伟大领袖毛主席的光辉形象。毛主席的无产阶级革命文艺路线，我们走定了！毛主席的光辉形象，我们画定了！
    在艰苦的创作过程中，这些美术战线上的新兵，多少次沉浸在幸福的构思中，多少次探索着最完美的构图。他们怀着对毛主席的无限热爱，反复进行认真讨论，最后采用了现在创作成功的构图和色彩。大家认为，这样的构图和着色，能够最集中、最突出、最鲜明地表现出毛主席的伟大光辉形象。
    开始上画布的这一天来到了，执笔的刘春华是多么激动啊！多少年来，这个贫农的儿子搜集了一大本毛主席的像片，盼望着有一天能画出一张大幅油画，来描绘我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席的伟大光辉形象。这最幸福的一天，现在终于来到了！他满怀着对毛主席最真挚、最深厚的无产阶级感情，怀着对中国赫鲁晓夫的深仇大恨，废寝忘食地创作这幅画。八月，那是他执笔绘画的最紧张的时候，多少天他睡不着觉，多少次他吃不下饭。骄阳当空的暑天，大厅里热得象个蒸笼。白天，他挥汗作画；夜里，他也按捺不住急切的心情，在画布前久久地揣摩端详，要把自己对毛主席最最深厚的感情倾注在画布上。
    胜利的时刻来到了！在全国亿万军民夺取无产阶级文化大革命决定性胜利的凯歌声中，一九六七年，我们伟大的中华人民共和国成立十八周年的前夕，大幅油画《毛主席去安源》，终于创作成功了。
    毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，指引着大幅油画《毛主席去安源》创作成功！
    革命的美术工作者，永远沿着毛主席的无产阶级革命路线奋勇前进！
    “大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想。”回顾两个多月战斗的胜利的创作过程，他们心潮澎湃、热血沸腾，一遍又一遍地高呼：
    “毛主席的无产阶级革命路线胜利万岁！”
    “无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利万岁！”
    “我们的伟大领袖毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！”
