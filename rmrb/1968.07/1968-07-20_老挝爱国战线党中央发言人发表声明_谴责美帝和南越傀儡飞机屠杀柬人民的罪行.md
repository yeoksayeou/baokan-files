	Kanhon, July 20 (Xinhua) - According to a report from the Pathet Lao News Agency: On July 12, the spokesperson for the Central Committee of the Laotian Patriotic Front issued a statement strongly condemning the savage act of U.S. imperialism and South Vietnamese puppet aircraft invading the skies of Cambodia's Prey Veng Province on June 29, strafing and killing or injuring 18 Cambodian civilians.

	The statement expressed that the Laotian Patriotic Front firmly supports the principled stance outlined in the Cambodian Royal Government's July 3 statement regarding this incident.

	The statement pointed out that these blatant actions taken by U.S. imperialists to realize their evil plot of intensifying and expanding their aggression across the entire Indochina Peninsula are serious violations of Cambodia's sovereignty and territorial integrity. They pose a serious threat to peace and security in Southeast Asia. The statement emphasized that U.S. imperialism and the South Vietnamese puppet regime must immediately stop all their acts of aggression against Cambodia.
