At a meeting of the Revolutionary Committee of the Nanchang Rubber Factory shortly after its establishment, one of the committee members proposed: "In the past period, the production plan was not completed well. Now we should concentrate for a period of time to push production up, and also show the superiority of the new revolutionary power." Some other committee members also thought this proposal was good. Someone even proposed specific targets. Li Zhengquan, a committee member and military representative, keenly felt that this was a wrong tendency of not emphasizing proletarian politics. He proposed that to focus on production, one must first focus on class struggle and revolutionary criticism, and to promote production through revolution. He suggested that everyone study Chairman Mao's teaching that "political work is the lifeline of all economic work," guiding everyone to carefully understand the profound meaning of Chairman Mao's teaching, and inspiring everyone to resolutely take the road of emphasizing proletarian politics.

After the meeting, Li Zhengquan took the initiative to have a heart-to-heart talk with the committee member who proposed the idea. When discussing the fact that production had not improved, Li Zhengquan said: "At a time like this, we must emphasize proletarian politics even more, and focus on class struggle and revolutionary criticism. As long as we grasp this key point, everything will fall into place, and production and other work can be done well."

The next morning, Li Zhengquan, together with the committee members, carried Chairman Mao's latest instructions on class struggle, holding high the portrait of Chairman Mao, beating drums and gongs, and going deep into the workshops, dormitories, and canteens. They propagated the great significance of focusing on class struggle and carrying out revolutionary criticism, and implemented Chairman Mao's latest instructions. The revolutionary workers were deeply moved and said: "The Revolutionary Committee, at a critical moment when the production task is pressing, first grasps the fundamentals, which is different from the old management! We must support the Revolutionary Committee with practical actions."

A few days later, rubber production showed new signs of improvement, but the increase in output was still not significant. The committee member who had been anxious again wanted to go to the workshops to work shifts and focus on production. Li Zhengquan did not find it troublesome because of his fluctuating thoughts. He again found this responsible comrade and studied with him, sentence by sentence, Chairman Mao's earnest teachings on opposing the purely military viewpoint. He told him about the fine tradition of the people's army emphasizing proletarian politics, introduced the glorious history of the people's army from small to large, from weak to strong because of emphasizing proletarian politics, and finally helped him raise his ideological awareness. At Li Zhengquan's suggestion, the Revolutionary Committee held a study class on Mao Zedong Thought. In the class, the comrade who originally advocated focusing on production was invited to share his process of ideological change, using this as a starting point to help other committee members correct their direction and raise their awareness. The committee members unanimously recognized that emphasizing proletarian politics is the fundamental direction of the Revolutionary Committee; political work is the "master switch" of all work. The more complex and heavy the tasks are, the more we must firmly grasp this "master switch" and unshakably emphasize proletarian politics.

After clarifying the direction, the committee members of the Revolutionary Committee all enthusiastically and vigorously threw themselves into the front lines, using Mao Zedong Thought to arm the masses, mobilize the masses, and organize the masses to launch a fierce attack on China's Khrushchev and a handful of class enemies within the factory. Suddenly, the workshops, dormitories, and canteens became battlefields for revolutionary criticism, and the production teams became combat units attacking class enemies. The revolutionary workers fiercely criticized China's Khrushchev's reactionary revisionist fallacies such as the "extinction of class struggle" and "production first." Old worker Xu Liangwu even thought about revolutionary criticism when he slept at night, getting up from bed in the middle of the night to write articles criticizing China's Khrushchev. Many revolutionary masses actively reported to the Revolutionary Committee about enemy situations, exposing the counter-revolutionary crimes of a handful of class enemies within the factory who opposed the party, opposed socialism, and sabotaged the new Revolutionary Committee. After days and nights of hard work, a handful of class enemies who had been hiding for a long time were finally exposed. All the revolutionary workers in the factory were jubilant and clapped their hands in praise. The workers said: "Now, when we work, our hearts are especially comfortable, and we have endless energy." The production of products such as rubber shoes has significantly increased, and the production task for June was completed in excess.

    生产任务越重　越要突出政治
    在南昌橡胶厂革委会成立不久的一次委员会议上，革委会的一位负责人提出：前段时间生产计划完成得不好，现在应当集中一段时间把生产突上去，也可以显示一下新生的革命政权的优越性。另外有些委员也认为这个主张很好。还有人提出了具体的指标。坐在一旁的革委会委员、军队代表李正荃同志敏锐地感到：这是一种不突出无产阶级政治的错误倾向。他提出抓生产首先要抓阶级斗争，抓革命大批判，要抓革命促生产。他建议大家学习毛主席关于“政治工作是一切经济工作的生命线”的教导，引导大家细心领会毛主席这一教导的深刻含义，启发大家坚决走突出无产阶级政治的道路。
    散会后，李正荃又主动找这位革委会的负责人促膝谈心。当谈到生产一度跃不上去的时候，李正荃说：“越是在这个时候，咱们越要突出无产阶级政治，狠抓阶级斗争和革命大批判。只要抓住了这一环，一通百通，生产和其它工作都可以搞得好。”
    第二天一早，李正荃跟革委会成员一起，带着伟大领袖毛主席关于阶级斗争的最新指示，高举毛主席画像，敲锣打鼓深入车间、宿舍、食堂，宣传抓阶级斗争和开展革命大批判的伟大意义，落实毛主席的最新指示。广大革命职工十分感动，他们说：革命委员会在生产任务压头的节骨眼上首先抓根本，和旧厂部就是不一样！咱们一定要用实际行动支持革命委员会。
    几天以后，橡胶生产有了新的起色，但产量增长的幅度仍不很大。革委会的那位负责同志又着急起来了，要下车间顶班劳动抓生产。李正荃没有因为他思想有反复而嫌麻烦。他又找到这位负责人，和他一段段、一句句地学习伟大领袖毛主席关于反对单纯军事观点的谆谆教导，给他讲述人民军队突出无产阶级政治的优良传统，介绍人民军队由于突出无产阶级政治，因而从小到大，从弱到强的光辉历程，终于帮助他提高了思想认识。在李正荃的建议下，革委会又举办了毛泽东思想学习班，在学习班里，请原来那位主张突出生产的同志介绍自己的思想变化过程，以点带面，用活教材帮助其他的委员端正方向，提高认识。委员们一致认识到：突出无产阶级政治是革命委员会的根本方向；政治工作是一切工作的“总开关”。越是在任务繁重，情况复杂的情况下，越要紧抓这个“总开关”，坚定不移地突出无产阶级政治。
    明确了方向以后，革委会的委员们都意气风发、斗志昂扬地投入第一线，用毛泽东思想武装群众，发动群众，组织群众，向中国赫鲁晓夫和厂内的一小撮阶级敌人展开猛烈的进攻。顿时，车间、宿舍、食堂变成了革命大批判的战场，生产班组变成了向阶级敌人进攻的战斗组。广大革命职工狠批了中国赫鲁晓夫散布的“阶级斗争熄灭”论和“生产第一”等反革命修正主义谬论。老工人许良武，连晚上睡觉也惦记着革命大批判的事，半夜里从床上爬起来写文章批判中国赫鲁晓夫。不少革命群众主动到革命委员会反映敌情，揭发厂内一小撮阶级敌人反党反社会主义和破坏新生的革命委员会的反革命罪行。经过日夜奋战，终于挖出了一小撮隐藏了很久的阶级敌人，全厂革命职工无不欢欣鼓舞，拍手称快。工人们说：“现在劳动起来，心情格外舒畅，浑身有使不完的劲。”胶鞋等产品的产量显著提高，六月份超额完成生产任务。　忠东兵
