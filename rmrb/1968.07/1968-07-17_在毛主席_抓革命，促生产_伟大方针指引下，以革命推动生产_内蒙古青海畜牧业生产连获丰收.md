Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production," the broad masses of revolutionary peasants and herdsmen, and revolutionary cadres in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region have been vigorously carrying out class struggle, conducting in-depth and sustained revolutionary criticism, using revolution to drive production, and achieving good harvests in livestock production for two consecutive years.

Statistics show that during the 1967 and 1968 livestock years, the region successfully raised and reared a total of over 21 million young livestock of various types, with the total number of livestock increasing by more than 20% each year. This year, the natural disasters were the most severe in recent years, but in the seven leagues and two cities of the region, except for one league that had an average year, the number of livestock in the other leagues and cities all increased by about 3% to 7%. Famous breeds such as the Sanhe Horse, Sanhe Cow, and Aohan Fine Wool Sheep have also developed significantly. The thriving livestock industry has enabled the autonomous region to provide more livestock and livestock products to the state, supporting the socialist construction of the country. In the past two years, the people's communes in the rural and pastoral areas of Inner Mongolia have sold nearly 6 million draft cattle, workhorses, and meat cattle and sheep to the state, over 100 million pounds of various wool, and 11.75 million hides of various cattle and sheep.

The continuous development of livestock production in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region is a great victory of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and the result of the united efforts of the broad masses of revolutionary peasants and herdsmen, and revolutionary cadres in their tenacious struggle against class enemies and natural disasters.

During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, a handful of capitalist roaders within the party and class enemies in society stirred up trouble, incited people to fight each other, and spread a counterrevolutionary wind of economicism, attempting to sabotage the revolution and production. The broad masses of revolutionary peasants and herdsmen, and revolutionary cadres resolutely implemented Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production," vigorously carried out the struggle between the two classes, two lines, and two roads, launched a fierce attack on a handful of class enemies, and smashed their evil plots to sabotage the revolution and production. The revolutionary peasants and herdsmen, and revolutionary cadres, armed with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, conducted an in-depth and sustained revolutionary criticism of China's Khrushchev and his agents in Inner Mongolia. The revolutionary peasants and herdsmen and revolutionary cadres said: "The most dangerous enemy of the herds on the grasslands is the wolf; the most dangerous enemy of us poor herdsmen is China's Khrushchev and his agents in Inner Mongolia. Without killing the wolves, the herds will not be safe; without overthrowing China's Khrushchev and his agents, we will not be at ease."

"In sailing the seas, the helmsman is needed; in making revolution, Mao Zedong Thought is needed." With profound proletarian feelings for the great leader Chairman Mao, the broad masses of revolutionary peasants and herdsmen, and revolutionary cadres launched a new high tide of the mass movement to study and apply Mao Zedong Thought. From the banners, counties to the communes, production teams, and households, various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes were held. They took "fight selfishness and criticize revisionism" as the key, used the "three old articles" as weapons, carried out extensive class education of recalling bitterness and thinking of sweetness, thoroughly criticized "selfishness," and advocated "publicness," which greatly promoted the revolutionization of thought and established the idea of raising livestock and herding for the revolution. They resolutely responded to Chairman Mao's great call to "learn from Dazhai in agriculture" and extensively carried out the mass movement to learn from Dazhai. Since last year, many leagues, banners, counties, and communes and production teams have held experience exchange meetings on learning from Dazhai or organized "learn from Dazhai" study classes. The spirit of learning from Dazhai people and walking the Dazhai path, wholeheartedly for the collective and wholeheartedly for the revolution, has been greatly carried forward.

Last winter and this spring, heavy snow fell in western Inner Mongolia, and the leagues of Xilingol, Bayannur, Ewenki, and Ulanqab suffered continuous snow disasters for three to four months. In many places, livestock could not graze for more than ten days in a row. In the struggle to fight disasters and protect livestock, the broad masses of revolutionary herdsmen fearlessly endured hardships, forgot to sleep, and carefully fed and managed the livestock. They braved the cold and broke through the snow to herd the livestock. Many herdsmen saved their rations to feed the sick and weak young livestock. In January, a severe blizzard hit the hometown of the grassland heroines Longmei and Yurong—Darlhan Teemchin An United Banner Xingbaolige Commune. The 60-year-old Erdunqicihe and her daughter Wuguiying's flock of sheep ran away with the wind. To prevent the collective's sheep from being lost, the mother and daughter fought against the blizzard for a day and night in temperatures of minus 40 degrees. The millions of poor herdsmen on the Inner Mongolia grasslands, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, are fighting bravely with such loyalty to seize victory in livestock production.

In the struggle to achieve a bumper harvest in livestock production, the People's Liberation Army stationed in the pastoral areas and the revolutionary committees at various levels organized a large number of support herding armies and Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams to go to the pastoral communes and teams, deeply into the pastures, livestock groups, and yurts to propagate Mao Zedong Thought, help carry out class struggle, and implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions. In the critical moments of the anti-disaster struggle, the People's Liberation Army and the transportation departments dispatched truck teams to help the pastoral communes and teams rush to transport anti-disaster materials. The league, banner, and commune revolutionary committees at various levels in the pastoral areas always remembered Chairman Mao's teaching of "serving the people wholeheartedly and never leaving the masses," always fought side by side with the herdsmen on the production frontline, studied, worked, and discussed together, discovered problems, and solved them in a timely manner, greatly encouraging the masses' confidence in overcoming disasters and achieving bumper harvests.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Xining, July 16—The unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has vigorously promoted the revolutionization of thought among the broad masses of herdsmen in the pastoral areas of Qinghai and driven the development of livestock production. After achieving bumper harvests in 1966 and 1967, the province's livestock industry has again achieved a bumper harvest this year, despite partial grasslands suffering from severe natural disasters. This is a great victory of Mao Zedong Thought and a fruitful achievement of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

This year, some grasslands in Qinghai's pastoral areas encountered severe natural disasters. Tianjun County's grasslands experienced heavy snowfall last winter and this spring, with some places accumulating snow up to two or three feet deep, putting the county's hundreds of thousands of livestock in a severe shortage of grass. In this situation, the county and township revolutionary committees immediately organized Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams, carrying revolutionary books, rushed to the anti-disaster frontline, armed the masses with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, and overcame natural disasters. In the day and night of the anti-disaster struggle, revolutionary cadres and herdsmen always insisted on studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. Mao Zedong Thought, once grasped by the masses, turns into boundless material force. The community members living in the remote mountainous areas of Su'eri District's Gahe Township, in extremely difficult conditions of snow-blocked mountains and blocked traffic, self-reliantly overcame difficulties. After five days and nights of struggle, they crossed mountains and valleys, trekked over 200 miles, and finally drove the collective livestock to places with thin snow and grass. Due to the joint efforts of the entire county, the livestock mortality rate was greatly reduced, and hundreds of thousands of livestock safely survived the snow disaster period.

Due to the study and application of Mao Zedong Thought, the broad masses of poor herdsmen, in the face of natural disasters, carried forward the spirit of communism, broke down the boundaries between counties, townships, and communes, and actively offered grasslands and fodder to support the disaster-stricken areas. Some production teams, although their grasslands were not abundant, for the sake of the overall situation, repeatedly offered their grasslands to the disaster-stricken brother production teams for grazing. The broad masses of herdsmen worked day and night, built sheds and pens. Some herdsmen even donated their own grain to supplement the feed for young and weak livestock. Some production teams' poor herdsmen voluntarily donated money to buy medicine for sick livestock. During the lambing and rearing season, the broad masses of herdsmen guarded the livestock day and night, carefully fed them, and strengthened their care. Therefore, some production teams, although they suffered from severe snow disasters, the lamb survival rate was still as high as over 95%.

    在毛主席“抓革命，促生产”伟大方针指引下，以革命推动生产
    内蒙古青海畜牧业生产连获丰收
    据新华社呼和浩特十六日电　内蒙古自治区广大革命农牧民和革命干部，在毛主席“抓革命，促生产”伟大方针的指引下，狠抓阶级斗争，深入持久地开展革命大批判，以革命推动生产，连续两年夺得了畜牧业生产的好收成。
    据统计，在一九六七和一九六八两个畜牧业年度里，全区接育成活各类仔畜共达两千一百多万头，牲畜总头数每年都增长百分之二十以上。今年的自然灾害在最近几年中是最严重的，但全区七盟二市中除一个盟是平年年景外，其余各盟、市牲畜头数都分别纯增百分之三到百分之七左右。著名的三河马、三河牛、敖汉细毛羊等优良品种牲畜这两年也有了很大发展。畜牧业的蓬勃发展，使自治区有更多的牲畜和畜产品交售给国家，支援国家社会主义建设。在最近两年里，内蒙古各地农村牧区人民公社向国家交售耕牛、役马和食用牛羊近六百万头，各种绒毛一亿多斤，各种牛羊皮一千一百七十五万张。
    内蒙古自治区畜牧业的连年发展，是毛主席无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利，是广大革命农牧民和革命干部齐心协力同阶级敌人和自然灾害顽强斗争的结果。
    无产阶级文化大革命中，党内一小撮走资派和社会上的阶级敌人，煽阴风，点鬼火，挑动群众斗群众，大刮反革命经济主义妖风，妄图破坏革命，破坏生产。广大革命农牧民和革命干部，坚决贯彻执行毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，狠抓两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争，向一小撮阶级敌人发起猛烈进攻，粉碎了阶级敌人破坏革命和生产的罪恶阴谋。广大革命农牧民和革命干部以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，对中国赫鲁晓夫及其在内蒙古代理人展开了深入持久的革命大批判。革命农牧民和革命干部说：“草原上畜群最危险的敌人是豺狼，我们贫苦牧民最危险的敌人是中国赫鲁晓夫及其在内蒙古的代理人。不打死豺狼，畜群不安宁；不批倒中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人，我们不安心。”
      “大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想。”广大革命农牧民和革命干部怀着对伟大领袖毛主席无比深厚的无产阶级感情，掀起了活学活用毛泽东思想群众运动的新高潮。从旗、县到公社、生产队和社员家庭，举办了各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班。他们以“斗私，批修”为纲，以“老三篇”为武器，大抓忆苦思甜的阶级教育，大破“私”字，大立“公”字，有力地促进了思想革命化，树立起为革命养畜，为革命放牧的思想。他们坚决响应毛主席“农业学大寨”的伟大号召，广泛地开展了学大寨的群众运动。去年以来，许多盟、旗、县和公社、生产队都召开了学习大寨经验交流会，或举办了“学大寨”学习班。学大寨人，走大寨路，一心为集体，一心为革命的精神大大发扬。
    去冬今春，内蒙古西部地区连降大雪，锡林郭勒、巴彦淖尔、伊克昭和乌兰察布等盟大部分牧区遭受了持续时间长达三四个月的雪灾，许多地方牲畜一连十几天不能出牧。在抗灾保畜斗争中，广大革命牧民不畏艰苦，废寝忘食，精心饲养管理牲畜，冒着严寒破雪放牧，许多牧民把口粮节省下来喂养病弱幼畜。今年一月，在草原英雄小姐妹龙梅、玉荣家乡——达尔罕茂明安联合旗新宝力格公社发生了一场特大暴风雪，六十多岁的额尔敦其其格和女儿武桂英放牧的羊群顺风奔窜，为了不让集体的羊群受损失，她们母女俩怀着对毛主席的无限忠心，在零下四十多度的严寒里同暴风雪搏斗了一昼夜。内蒙古草原上千千万万用毛泽东思想武装起来的贫苦牧民，就是这样赤胆忠心，为夺取畜牧业生产胜利而英勇奋战。
    在夺取畜牧业生产丰收的斗争中，驻牧区的人民解放军和各级革命委员会组织了大批支牧大军和毛泽东思想宣传队分赴牧区社队，深入到牧场、畜群组和蒙古包宣传毛泽东思想，帮助开展阶级斗争和落实毛主席的最新指示。在抗灾斗争紧急时刻，人民解放军和交通运输部门都派出汽车队帮助牧区社队抢运抗灾物资。牧区盟、旗和公社各级革命干部牢记毛主席“全心全意地为人民服务，一刻也不脱离群众”的教导，始终和牧民群众并肩战斗在生产第一线，共同学习、共同劳动、共同商量，发现问题，及时解决，极大地鼓舞了群众战胜灾害、争取丰收的信心。
    据新华社西宁十六日电　史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命，有力地促进了青海牧区广大牧民的思想革命化，推动了畜牧业生产的发展。全省畜牧业继一九六六年和一九六七年连续两年夺得丰收之后，今年在部分草原遭到特大自然灾害的情况下，又获得丰收。这是伟大的毛泽东思想的胜利，是无产阶级文化大革命的丰硕成果。
    今年，青海牧区部分草原遇到了特大自然灾害，天峻县草原去冬今春连降数次大雪，有些地方积雪达二三尺厚，全县数十万头牲畜处于严重缺草的困难境地。在这种情况下，县、乡革委会立即组成毛泽东思想宣传队，带上革命宝书，奔赴抗灾第一线，用战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装群众，战胜自然灾害。在抗灾斗争的日日夜夜里，广大革命干部和牧民，始终坚持活学活用毛主席著作。毛泽东思想为广大群众所掌握，就变成了无穷的物质力量。居住在边远山区的苏里区尕河乡的社员们，在大雪封山，交通阻塞的极端困难的情况下，他们自力更生，克服困难。经过五昼夜的奋战，翻山越岭，艰苦跋涉二百多里，终于把集体牲畜赶到了雪薄有草的地方。由于全县人民的共同努力，牲畜死亡率大大降低，数十万头牲畜安全度过了雪灾期。
    由于活学活用毛泽东思想，广大贫苦牧民在自然灾害面前，发扬共产主义精神，打破了县、乡、社之间的界限，主动让出草山和饲草，支援受灾地区。有些生产队本来草山就不宽余，为了顾全大局，先后几次把草山让给受灾的兄弟生产队放牧。广大牧民日夜奋战，修棚打圈。有的牧民还拿出自己的粮食给幼畜和瘦弱牲畜补饲。有些生产队的贫苦牧民自动捐款，给病畜买药治病。在接羔育幼的季节里，广大牧民日夜守在畜群旁，精心喂养，加强护理。因此，有些生产队虽然遭到特大雪灾，但羊羔的成活率仍然高达百分之九十五以上。
