Editor's Note: Our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out at the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee: "Using novels to engage in anti-party activities is a great invention. Anyone who wants to overthrow a regime must first create public opinion and first do ideological work." The reactionary novel *Wind and Thunder* is a piece of evidence of the Chinese Khrushchev using novels to engage in anti-party activities.

*The Wind and Thunder*, this poisonous weed of anti-party and anti-socialism, was concocted under the personal instructions of the Chinese Khrushchev. It wears the cloak of "writing about agricultural cooperativization" to spread counter-revolutionary black winds and strike capitalist thunder, viciously attacking our great party, shamelessly slandering the dictatorship of the proletariat, and creating counter-revolutionary public opinion for the Chinese Khrushchev's usurpation and restoration of power.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The rightists are our teachers from the opposite side. In this regard, poisonous weeds have merits." We should thank the efforts of Chen Dengke and others, thank these teachers from the opposite side, they make the revolutionary people understand: how the class enemies use novels to engage in anti-party activities; how the counter-revolutionaries use two-faced tactics; why the revolutionary people must firmly grasp the class struggle in the ideological realm.

In the midst of the triumphant songs of the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we should raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, continue to strongly carry out revolutionary criticism, deeply criticize various poisonous weeds, thoroughly eliminate their poison, and implement the dictatorship of the proletariat over the bourgeoisie in the ideological realm!

Our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out at the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee: "Using novels to engage in anti-party activities is a great invention. Anyone who wants to overthrow a regime must first create public opinion and first do ideological work. The revolutionary class is like this, and the counter-revolutionary class is also like this." The reactionary novel *Wind and Thunder* is a piece of evidence of the Chinese Khrushchev using novels to engage in anti-party activities.

In 1962, amidst the stormy winds and foul weather stirred up by domestic and foreign class enemies, the Chinese Khrushchev took to the field, viciously attacking the dictatorship of the proletariat, brazenly opposing the party's general line for socialist construction, and openly advocating for the rehabilitation of the right-opportunist Peng Dehuai. At the expanded Central Work Conference, he brazenly declared that he wanted to "revise" the history of the Chinese revolution, just as Khrushchev "revised" the history of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union written by Stalin, in an attempt to reverse the wheel of history. He also specifically instructed his agent Li Baohua in Anhui to "go back and write a book about the history of the past three years. If you are brave, turn it into a play. If you are even braver, erect a monument to pass it on to future generations."

The reactionary novel *Wind and Thunder* is a poisonous weed that was meticulously crafted under the orders of the Chinese Khrushchev to distort the "history of the past three years," defame the Three Red Banners, attack the socialist system and the dictatorship of the proletariat, and erect a monument for the Chinese Khrushchev's usurpation and restoration of power.

After the initial draft of *Wind and Thunder*, titled *In Search of My Father*, was completed, it received a chorus of praise from the lackeys of the literary black line led by Zhou Yang and Li Baohua. Amidst the cheers and applause, they also worried that *Wind and Thunder* was too blatant and instructed Chen Dengke: "It's too explicit and realistic, not good," advising him to "add some cooperativization elements." Chen Dengke took the order and had someone add some phrases about "agricultural cooperativization" to the book. This created the illusion that it was a book about agricultural cooperativization.

"False is false, and the disguise should be stripped away." Setting aside the intermittent "cooperativization" elements in the book, *Wind and Thunder* reveals its true form. Chen Dengke himself admitted: "I wrote about cooperativization, which means criticizing these three years." This fully exposes his counter-revolutionary face: writing about agricultural cooperativization is a cover, distorting the "history of the past three years" is the real intention.

Now, let us strip away the disguise of *Wind and Thunder* and see what kind of poison it spreads?

What kind of wind is it blowing?

The Chinese Khrushchev, at the expanded Central Work Conference, portrayed the revolutionary situation as pitch-black, spreading the wind of individual farming and rehabilitation, viciously attacking the party's Three Red Banners and the socialist system. The black wind and thunder that Chen Dengke blew in *Wind and Thunder* are exactly the same as the Chinese Khrushchev's black goods.

In the novel, Chen Dengke fabricated a so-called "particularly backward" Huangni Township, smearing the socialist new countryside under the radiance of the general line as a mess. Here, "food is scarce, firewood is difficult to obtain, and people are fleeing," causing one food riot after another. Here, "morale is low," "sighs and complaints," "loss of confidence." This is clearly a deliberate attempt to blacken the socialist system and the Three Red Banners!

*Wind and Thunder*, through the slander of agricultural collectivization, spreads the wind of individual farming. In Chen Dengke's pen, the vast majority of cadres and poor and lower-middle peasants in Huangni Township are oppressed by disasters, "unable to straighten their backs," selfish and backward, longing for individual farming, with no enthusiasm for the socialist road. To organize a sideline production team, it takes the strength of nine oxen and two tigers; just as it gets started, "it withers away in three days!" Those who struggle to gather together "agricultural mutual aid teams" disperse at the slightest breeze or rustle of leaves.

In the surrounding areas where mutual aid and cooperation movements have already begun, Huangni Township remains a "blank spot." An old poor peasant said: "Our village... if you want to organize them... to work together, that's difficult." As a young activist, Lu Suyun brazenly shouted: "One person leading three children, living better than anyone else!" Isn't this a challenge to the collective economy of socialism?

In Chen Dengke's pen, He Laoqiu, Lu Suyun, Wan Chunfang, and other "poor and lower-middle peasants" are indifferent to the leaders of the township who engage in capitalist restoration activities, delay the development of agricultural collectivization, and have never resisted, but rather appreciate it, saying: "Being a common person, one can avoid being oppressed and exploited by landlords and rich peasants, and have a peaceful and stable life, that's heaven." This is clearly a propaganda for the "heavenly life" of individual economy!

After the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee, *Wind and Thunder* still spreads the wind of individual farming, obviously in support of the "three freedoms and one contract" and "responsibility system" advocated by the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Anhui!

*Wind and Thunder* also constantly incites "venting," spreading the wind of rehabilitation. Zhu Yongkang often appears in the guise of "Judge of Heaven," using the pretext of visiting the poor and asking about hardships, secretly stirring up people to complain about the Communist Party and vent their grievances against the new society. Many people praised Zhu Yongkang, saying, "This time, all the grievances in my stomach for several years have been vented at once," and even such blatantly reactionary words as "since liberation, we have not been able to turn over" came out. Isn't the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Anhui, Li Baohua and others, inciting ghosts and monsters to attack the Three Red Banners and the dictatorship of the proletariat in the name of "venting" in the period around 1962? What is "venting"? It is counter-revolutionary rebellion! The black words in the book that slander the broad poor and lower-middle peasants as having "only half-turned over" or "not turned over at all" since liberation are the original version of the black words of the Chinese Khrushchev and Li Baohua.

"Judge Zhu" discovered a so-called "wrongful case" in his mysterious activities.

The Ren Weiqun described in the book is a "hardworking and dedicated" militia squad leader, an "invaluable good cadre." However, just because he tied up and beat the reactionary rich peasant Huang Longfei, he was demoted and disarmed; just because he seized Huang Longfei's smuggled grain, he was almost expelled from the party. It is clear that this is a typical case of being persecuted by so-called "excessive struggle." Due to the appearance of Zhu Yongkang, the resentment of Ren Weiqun and his group surged, loudly shouting "it was wrong to demote Ren Weiqun," "for unjust things, I must speak out"; Ren Weiqun "was forced down from the stage," "how can we get better!" To rehabilitate Ren Weiqun, Zhu Yongkang personally presided over the "venting" and "rehabilitation" meeting, and under his incitement and support, Ren Weiqun became arrogant, loudly shouting "my heart is red," brazenly slandering our party for wrongly beating "good people."

Why does *Wind and Thunder* emphasize "excessive struggle"? Why does it repeatedly stress the need to rehabilitate Ren Weiqun? This conspiracy must be exposed!

The Chinese Khrushchev, at the expanded Central Work Conference, attacked our party's struggle against right-opportunism as "wrong and excessive struggle," and at the large meeting in Anhui, he also maliciously divided the cadres into "those who beat and those who are beaten," completely denying the struggle between the two lines within the party. The Ren Weiqun in Chen Dengke's pen is a typical "beaten" figure created to propagate the Chinese Khrushchev's slander that the struggle within the party is "excessive struggle." "Hardworking and dedicated to the people" but "beaten," isn't this "unjust demotion"? It is clear for whom they are pleading and complaining, isn't it!

Chairman Mao teaches us: "In the present world, all culture or literature and art belong to a certain class and a certain political line." *Wind and Thunder* is a product of the revisionist political line represented by the Chinese Khrushchev. The black wind it spreads is to create public opinion for the Chinese Khrushchev's restoration of capitalism. Portraying the situation as "pitch-black" is to attack the proletarian revolutionary line and the dictatorship of the proletariat in public opinion, to mobilize forces for their usurpation and restoration of power; the wind of rehabilitation is to prepare organizationally and politically for the establishment of bourgeois dictatorship; the wind of individual farming is to shake and disintegrate socialism economically, to complete the task of restoring capitalism. The several black winds stirred up by the Chinese Khrushchev complement and echo each other, their purpose is to usurp the party and restore power, to change the color of China.

What path is it taking?

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Socialist society is a relatively long historical stage. In this historical stage of socialism, there still exist classes, class contradictions, and class struggle, the struggle between the socialist and capitalist roads, and the danger of capitalist restoration."

From the beginning of *Wind and Thunder*, it describes the protagonist Zhu Yongkang walking in the wind and snow on the Huaibei Plain, to the last sentence at the end of the book, it is still describing him walking against the "reverse wind." In the struggle between the socialist and capitalist roads, which path does Zhu Yongkang take?

Soon after Zhu Yongkang arrived in Huangni Township, he discovered that the root cause of its backwardness was that Zhu Xikun abandoned agricultural production, organized people to go to the lake to catch rabbits, and took the capitalist road. He wanted to "change" this situation, so he found a trick, which was to vigorously promote the sideline production of weaving mats. The book describes that it was because Zhu Yongkang organized a large number of weaving mat mutual aid teams, wove a large number of mats, made money, and saved the disaster, that he led Huangni Township onto the road of "organization." It can be seen that making money by weaving mats is the "path" of socialist collectivization that the book propagates. The main characters in the book all revolve around this issue.

What kind of path is Zhu Yongkang's "path"? If we peel off the skin of this batch of "mutual aid teams," it is not difficult to see their essence.

The purpose of organizing this batch of "mutual aid teams" is not to take the socialist road at all, but to make "a thin profit and thick profit transaction," to make "hands flexible."

The operating method of this batch of weaving mat teams is "self-responsibility for profit and loss," "each weaves their own," "the more you weave, the more money you make." To promote this operating method, the book specially arranges a long speech by Zhu Yongkang, talking about technology, accounting, and "each to their own." In short, it is a matter of "partnership in individual farming"! Chen Dengke presents such goods as "socialism," which precisely exposes their sinister plot to restore capitalism.

Originally, Zhu Yongkang's organizing of weaving mats and Zhu Xikun's organizing of people to catch rabbits have no essential difference, both taking the capitalist road. After Zhu Yongkang's "reformation," the capitalist tide in Huangni Township did not decrease but flooded, not hidden but openly "legalized."

Who does Zhu Yongkang rely on to carry out such "collectivization"? He secretly collected a group of confidants through secret activities and covert investigations, seizing the leadership of Huangni Township. These people are either demoted and disarmed "rehabilitated heroes"; or backward in thought, infatuated with individual farming "heroines"; or love supreme, sentimental lovers; or eating, drinking, flattering, and praising brothers. To carry out socialism with such a group of people as the "leadership core" is not a ghostly sight!

To advocate that Zhu Yongkang is taking the socialist road, *Wind and Thunder* repeatedly propagates that as early as 1954, Zhu Yongkang had carried out a "socialist education movement" in Huangni Township. Obviously, this is a careful arrangement made during the creation of *Wind and Thunder*, as the Chinese Khrushchev's "left in form but right in essence" black goods came out.

What kind of movement is this? According to the description in *Wind and Thunder*, the "movement" faced a very complex situation, "internal contradictions and external contradictions are intertwined," that is, the nonsense that the Chinese Khrushchev talked about "party internal and external contradictions intersect." The method of the "movement" is "rooting and connecting," "visiting the poor and asking about hardships." The objects of struggle in the "movement" are the "broken shoes" and lazybones in the countryside, while the class enemies and their agents within the party are spared and allowed to pass. Obviously, this "movement" implements a set of Chinese Khrushchev's "left in form but right in essence" bourgeois reactionary line.

Our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out that the nature of the Four Clean-ups is the contradiction between socialism and capitalism, and the focus of the movement is to rectify those in power within the party who take the capitalist road. The movement must fully mobilize the masses, rely on the majority of the masses, rely on the majority of the cadres, and severely strike a small handful of class enemies. Zhu Yongkang's "movement" is in complete opposition to Chairman Mao's instructions. The "movement" carried out in Huangni Township is a fake Four Clean-ups, true restoration.

Chairman Mao pointed out in the big-character poster *Bombard the Headquarters*: "In connection with the rightist deviation in 1962 and the 'left in form but right in essence' erroneous tendency in 1964, isn't it enlightening?" The various performances of Zhu Yongkang in the reactionary novel *Wind and Thunder* are exactly the illustration of the black line of the Chinese Khrushchev from the rightist deviation in 1962 to the "left in form but right in essence" in 1964.

All this fully proves that Zhu Yongkang is taking the capitalist road.

What "father" is he seeking?

The Chinese Khrushchev roared at the expanded Central Work Conference in Anhui: "The three years of difficulty in our country are 'three parts natural disaster, seven parts man-made disaster.'" He reversed right and wrong, confused black and white, slandering the three years of economic difficulties as caused by our great, glorious, and correct Communist Party of China. The wolf's ambition is so vicious!

The reactionary novel *Wind and Thunder* fully embodies the malicious intentions of the Chinese Khrushchev, portraying all party organizations as rotten to the core, either rotten from the outside in like "dirt clods," or rotten from the inside out like "peanuts." The leading cadres of the party are either degenerate and corrupted elements or class alien elements; either two-faced hypocrites or "old affairs," muddle-headed fools. In short, as suggested by Fang Yanyan singing *Female Escort* in the initial draft *In Search of My Father*: "There are no good people in Hongtong County!"

*The Wind and Thunder*'s attack on our party is particularly vicious in its portrayal of the county committee secretary Fang Xudong. Fang Xudong is the highest leader of this "miserable and desolate" world of Huangni Township. Chen Dengke attributes all the disasters he fabricated to Fang Xudong. He said that Fang Xudong was "high above, unaware of the situation below," squatting in the "strict" "yamen," forgetting the people he had once saved with his life and blood; he was "subjective and arbitrary," directing the spearhead at his comrades, harming "loyal and good" people like Ren Weiqun, and protecting and promoting power-hungry officials like Xiong Bin and Zhu Xikun. He also used the words of the poor peasant He Laoqiu to curse Fang Xudong: "You are subjective!" "You are ungrateful!" "Huangni Township is in such a state, don't you have any responsibility?"

Chen Dengke still felt that cursing was not enough to vent his hatred for our proletarian headquarters, so in Chapter 51, he specially designed the scene of Fang Xudong's "car overturning," describing Fang Xudong driving the socialist "big carriage" into the mud, and Fang Xudong himself becoming "black-faced," "as if he had been hit by someone, dazed and confused, lowering his head..." This is a reactionary political slang! Chen Dengke, guilty of treason, secretly deleted the sentence "as if he had been hit by someone" in the second printing of *Wind and Thunder*. This deletion only exposes their counter-revolutionary tracks more! The reactionary element Tian Han once shouted in the big poisonous weed *Xie Yaohuan*: "The water that carries the boat also capsizes the boat," and Chen Dengke here also described a scene of the car stuck in the mud and people and horses falling over. One wants to "capsize the boat," and the other wants to "overturn the carriage." In the eyes of the Chinese Khrushchev and his big and small lackeys, the "boat" of the dictatorship of the proletariat is about to "capsize," and the socialist "carriage" is about to "overturn," and their day of usurping the party and restoring power is coming. The yellow millet dream of this group of reactionaries is truly beautiful!

Indeed, Chen Dengke, after careful design, promoted a "tall" figure in *Wind and Thunder*, which is the ideal "hero" of the bourgeois headquarters - the second secretary of the district committee, Zhu Yongkang.

Zhu Yongkang appeared in the so-called critical moment of "disaster pressure," "low morale and dispersed spirits," "food scarcity," bringing a large amount of "life-saving" grain from the sky, floating and flying in. Zhu Yongkang's appearance made the "dark clouds" of Huangni Township immediately present a scene of "snow melting" and "river ice thawing, spring returning to the earth," and after his "thunderous roar," a food riot immediately dissipated. The Zhu Yongkang in *Wind and Thunder* is indeed a "savior" who can turn the situation around!

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The people, and only the people, are the motive force in the creation of world history." The people armed with Mao Zedong Thought are the most selfless, fearless, intelligent, and brave. No matter how great the disaster, they can overcome it, and no matter how great the difficulty, it cannot shake their determination to take the socialist road. Chen Dengke's purpose in highlighting Zhu Yongkang's appearance is to defame the people, praise the representatives of the bourgeoisie, attack the socialist system, and oppose our great party.

To strengthen Zhu Yongkang's "revival" power as a representative of the bourgeoisie, Chen Dengke arranged a "search for the father" plot for Zhu Yongkang from beginning to end. The predecessor of *Wind and Thunder* is called *In Search of My Father*. People cannot help but wonder, why must the plot of "searching for the father" be added to Zhu Yongkang, a "Communist Party member"? Chen Dengke once confessed: "Searching for the father is not a life proposition, but a political proposition. Searching for the father is searching for the truth of the party." "Searching for the father" reveals the key to exposing the reactionary theme of this novel.

What "searching for the truth of the party"! In the eyes of the counter-revolutionary Chen Dengke and others, our great, glorious, and correct Communist Party of China has no "truth" left, this is precisely the reactionary fallacy of the Chinese Khrushchev's mad cry of "the party's tradition has been destroyed," "the party's prestige has been lost," and "the bigger the official, the less truth" turned upside down.

Truth has class nature. Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought are the truth of the proletariat, which is also the truth of our party. Comrade Mao Zedong is the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time. Mao Zedong Thought is a powerful ideological weapon against imperialism and revisionism, and is the guiding principle for the revolutionary people to carry out revolutionary struggles and socialist construction. The Chinese Khrushchev and his agents desperately shout about searching for what "truth of the party," whose "truth" do they want to search for?

Let's see the confession in *Wind and Thunder*: The entire ideological motivation for Zhu Yongkang's taking office is to decide to follow the "deep" "footprints" left by the "leaders of the Central Committee" on the land of Huaibei and continue to advance.

Who exactly is the person with "deep footprints" in Huaibei? Looking at the history, it is clear: this person with "deep footprints" is the Chinese Khrushchev who once hid here to avoid the anti-Japanese war. The Chinese Khrushchev not only has the "footprints" of being a deserter here during the Anti-Japanese War, but also came to Huaibei three times after liberation, leaving the "footprints" of usurping and restoring power. Among them, the "deepest" time was to Zuyun County, Wulong Commune, Wulong Lake. He spoke nonsense here, spouted nonsense, openly displayed his black goods, and opposed the great leader Chairman Mao's instruction of "definitely improving the Huai River," destroying the water system of Huaibei and bringing disaster to the people of Huaibei. The book writes that when Zhu Yongkang "inspected" Wulong Lake, the "lake treatment" plan he discussed with Ren Weiqun is the same as the spirit of the Chinese Khrushchev's "instruction." This is not following the "footprints" of the Chinese Khrushchev? Who does Zhu Yongkang long for, and whose "father" is he searching for, isn't it clear?

To expose the reactionary theme of *Wind and Thunder* to the bottom, in the eyes of the group of reactionary elements in the bourgeois headquarters, our great party has already "stuck in the mud"; only by following the "footprints" of the Chinese Khrushchev can it "turn the situation around," so they want to "search for the father." "Father" is the Chinese Khrushchev, he is the incarnation of bourgeois "truth," he is the "father" of that group of ghosts and monsters and counter-revolutionary revisionists, "searching for the father" is to search for the Chinese Khrushchev and his counter-revolutionary revisionist line, it is to usurp the leadership of the Central Committee of the party by the Chinese Khrushchev, to restore capitalism. This is the crux of *In Search of My Father* - *Wind and Thunder*, and it is also the entire evil intention hidden in *Wind and Thunder*.

The "monument" that the Chinese Khrushchev shouted to erect at the expanded Central Work Conference is such a black monument of usurping and restoring power!

We must use the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to smash the capitalist restoration demon wind blown by *Wind and Thunder*, destroy the capitalist road it propagates, overthrow their "father" who is searching left and right - the Chinese Khrushchev, and thoroughly smash the black monument they want to "pass on to future generations"!

Our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out in his latest instructions: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is essentially a great political revolution under the conditions of socialism, a revolution by the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes, a continuation of the long-term struggle between the Communist Party of China led by the Communist Party and the Kuomintang reactionaries, and a continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie." Our criticism of the reactionary novel *Wind and Thunder* is a continuation of this struggle. The "father" sought in *Wind and Thunder* is the representative of the interests of the Kuomintang reactionaries, the representative of imperialism, the bourgeoisie, and the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, the Chinese Khrushchev. The creators of *Wind and Thunder* are a group of remnants of the Kuomintang reactionaries under the protection of the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Anhui. This clearly shows the essence of our struggle with them.

The unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has entered the crucial moment of achieving comprehensive victory. We, the proletarian revolutionaries and the broad masses of revolutionary people, must raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, deeply carry out revolutionary criticism, resolutely oppose right-opportunism, right-splittism, and right-capitulationism, smash the rightist rehabilitation demon wind, and resolutely root out the handful of traitors, spies, unrepentant capitalist-roaders, and other counter-revolutionaries hiding in the revolutionary ranks, and carry out the political revolution of the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes to the end!

    彻底砸烂中国赫鲁晓夫篡党复辟的黑碑
    ——批判陈登科的反动小说《风雷》
    安学江
    编者按：我们伟大的领袖毛主席在党的八届十中全会上指出：“利用小说进行反党活动，是一大发明。凡是要推翻一个政权，总要先造成舆论，总要先做意识形态方面的工作。”反动小说《风雷》，就是中国赫鲁晓夫利用小说进行反党活动的一个罪证。
    《风雷》这株反党反社会主义的大毒草，是在中国赫鲁晓夫亲自授意下炮制出笼的。它披着“写农业合作化”的外衣，大刮反革命黑“风”，大打资本主义妖“雷”，穷凶极恶地攻击我们伟大的党，肆无忌惮地污蔑无产阶级专政，为中国赫鲁晓夫篡党复辟制造反革命的舆论。
    毛主席教导我们：“右派是从反面教导我们的人。在这点上，毒草有功劳。”我们要谢谢陈登科等人的劳作，谢谢这些反面教员，他们使革命的人民懂得：阶级敌人是如何利用小说进行反党活动的；反革命分子是怎样耍两面派手法的；革命的人民为什么必须狠抓意识形态领域里的阶级斗争。
    在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的凯歌声中，我们应当更高地举起毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，继续有力地开展革命的大批判，深入批判各种毒草，彻底肃清它们的流毒，在意识形态领域里实行无产阶级对资产阶级的专政！
    伟大领袖毛主席在党的八届十中全会上指出：“利用小说进行反党活动，是一大发明。凡是要推翻一个政权，总要先造成舆论，总要先做意识形态方面的工作。革命的阶级是这样，反革命的阶级也是这样。”反动小说《风雷》就是中国赫鲁晓夫利用小说进行反党活动的罪恶铁证。
    一九六二年，在国内外阶级敌人掀起的恶风浊雨中，中国赫鲁晓夫赤膊上阵，恶毒攻击无产阶级专政，猖狂反对党的社会主义建设总路线，公然替右倾机会主义分子彭德怀翻案。他在扩大的中央工作会议上，大放厥词，扬言要象赫鲁晓夫“修改”“斯大林写过的”联共党史一样，“修改”中国的革命历史，妄图倒转历史的车轮；并且特地指使他在安徽的代理人李葆华之流：“回去以后，把前三年的历史写本书。如果勇敢些，就把它编剧演，再勇敢些，就立碑传给后代。”
    反动小说《风雷》，就是遵中国赫鲁晓夫之命，由披着“工农作家”外衣的反革命分子陈登科精心炮制的颠倒“前三年的历史”、诋毁三面红旗、攻击社会主义制度和无产阶级专政、为中国赫鲁晓夫树碑立传的一株大毒草。
    《风雷》的初稿《寻父记》写成后，博得了周扬文艺黑线的干将邵荃麟以及李葆华们的一片喝采声。在叫好鼓噪之余，他们又担心《风雷》的反骨太露，特地向陈登科关照：“写得太露太实，不好”，要“加些合作化的情节”。陈登科领命照办，找人在书中加了一些“农业合作化”的词句。这样就造成一种假象，似乎这是描写农业合作化的一本书。
      “假的就是假的，伪装应当剥去。”撇开书中时断时续的“合作化”情节，《风雷》便赤裸裸地现出了它的原形。这一点，陈登科自供不讳：“我写合作化，就是指责这三年。”这就充分暴露了他的反革命嘴脸：描写农业合作化是假，篡改“前三年的历史”是真。
    现在，让我们剥去《风雷》的伪装，看一看这株大毒草所宣扬的究竟是些什么货色？
        刮的什么风
    中国赫鲁晓夫在扩大的中央工作会议上，把革命形势说成漆黑一团，大刮单干风、翻案风，恶毒攻击党的三面红旗和社会主义制度。陈登科在《风雷》中刮起的黑风，打起的妖雷，正是中国赫鲁晓夫的这一套黑货。
    在小说中，陈登科捏造了一个所谓“特殊落后”的黄泥乡，把总路线光辉照耀下的社会主义新农村污蔑得一塌糊涂。在这里，“粮食紧张，烧草困难，人口外流”，发生了一起又一起的闹粮风潮。在这里，“军心不振”，“唉声叹气”，“失去信心”。这完全是别有用心地给社会主义制度抹黑，给三面红旗抹黑！
    《风雷》通过对农业集体化的污蔑，大刮单干风。在陈登科的笔下，黄泥乡的广大干部和贫下中农群众，都被灾荒压得“直不开腰”，“自私落后”，留恋单干，毫无走社会主义道路的积极性。要组织个副业生产组，得费九牛二虎的力气；刚刚搞起来，“三朝不到晚，就夭折了！”那些拚死拚活拉到一起的“农业互助组”，稍有一点风吹草动就“散伙了，不干了”。
    在周围已经开展起互助合作运动的情况下，黄泥乡仍然一直是“空白点”。老贫农说：“俺庄上的人……你要叫他组织起来……在一起劳动，那就难了。”作为青年积极分子的陆素云竟然大言不惭地叫喊：“一人领三个孩子，过得比谁都强！”这不是在向社会主义的集体经济示威吗？
    在陈登科的笔下，何老九、陆素云、万春芳等“贫下中农”，对乡里的领导者大搞复辟资本主义活动，迟迟不开展农业集体化运动，根本无动于衷，从来没有抵制，倒是极为欣赏地说：“做个老百姓，一能不受地主富农欺压，二能不受地主富农剥削，三能有个太太平平安定日子过，就是天堂的生活了。”这分明是在宣扬个体经济的“天堂生活”！
    在党的八届十中全会以后，《风雷》仍然大刮单干风，显然是在为中国赫鲁晓夫及其在安徽的代理人所推行的“三自一包”、“责任田”招魂！
    《风雷》还不断煽动“出气”，大刮翻案风。祝永康经常以“青天大人”的面目出现，打着访贫问苦的幌子，鬼鬼祟祟，煽动人们诉共产党之“苦”，出新社会之“气”。许多人赞扬祝永康，“这一来，把俺肚子里好几年的闷气，一家伙都出完了”，甚至连“解放以来”“还没有翻过身来”这样露骨反动的话都冒了出来。中国赫鲁晓夫及其在安徽的代理人李葆华之流，在一九六二年前后，鼓动牛鬼蛇神攻击三面红旗和无产阶级专政，不正是在“出气”的名义下进行的吗！什么是“出气”？就是反革命翻天！书中端出来的污蔑广大贫下中农解放后“只翻半个身”或“根本没翻身”的黑话，就是中国赫鲁晓夫和李葆华们黑话的原版。
    “祝青天”在他的神秘活动中，发现了一起所谓“冤案”。
    书中描写的任为群，是个“任劳任怨为群众”的民兵大队长，“不可多得的好干部”。可是，仅仅因为他捆打了反动富农黄龙飞，就被罢了官，缴了枪；仅仅因为他查获了黄龙飞的走私粮食，就险些被开除党籍。很明显，这是个受到所谓“过火斗争”迫害的典型。由于祝永康的出现，任为群那一伙的怨气便冲天而出，大肆叫嚣“撤任为群的职就是不该”，“对不平的事，俺就是要讲”；任为群“被人赶下了台”，“俺们还咋能好得起来”！为了替任为群平反，祝永康亲自主持“出气”“平反”会，在他的鼓动和支持下，任为群嚣张到了极点，大叫“我的心是红的”，明目张胆地诬蔑我们党错打了“好人”。
    《风雷》为什么要大写特写“过火斗争”？为什么要一再强调必须为任为群翻案？这个阴谋必须揭穿！
      中国赫鲁晓夫在扩大的中央工作会议上，攻击我们党反对右倾机会主义的斗争是“错误的过火的斗争”，在安徽大组会上，他还别有用心地把干部分成
  “打人的和挨打的”两类，一笔抹杀党内两条路线的斗争。陈登科笔下的任为群，正是为了宣扬中国赫鲁晓夫诽谤党内斗争是“过火斗争”而炮制出来的一个“挨打”的典型。“任劳任怨为群众”而“挨打”，这岂不是“将我罢官理不公”吗！这是在为什么人鸣冤叫屈，不是十分清楚了吗！
    毛主席教导我们：“在现在世界上，一切文化或文学艺术都是属于一定的阶级，属于一定的政治路线的。”《风雷》正是从属于以中国赫鲁晓夫为代表的修正主义政治路线的。它所刮起的黑风，就是为中国赫鲁晓夫复辟资本主义制造舆论的。把形势说得“漆黑一团”，是从舆论上攻击无产阶级革命路线和无产阶级专政，为他们的篡党复辟活动动员力量；翻案风，从组织上、政治上为建立资产阶级专政进行准备；单干风，从经济上动摇瓦解社会主义，完成复辟资本主义的任务。中国赫鲁晓夫掀起的这几股黑风，彼此配合，互相呼应，其目的就是为了篡党复辟，改变中国的颜色。
        走的什么路
    毛主席教导我们：“社会主义社会是一个相当长的历史阶段。在社会主义这个历史阶段中，还存在着阶级、阶级矛盾和阶级斗争，存在着社会主义同资本主义两条道路的斗争，存在着资本主义复辟的危险性。”
      《风雷》一开篇，便描写了主人公祝永康在淮北平原顶着风雪走路，直到全书结尾的最后一句，还是在描写他顶着“逆风”走路。祝永康在社会主义同资本主义这两条道路中间，走的到底是哪一条路呢？
    祝永康到黄泥乡不久，就发现了那里落后的根源，是由于朱锡坤放弃农业生产，组织人下湖打兔子，走资本主义道路。他要“改变”这种局面，于是找到了一个窍门，就是大搞编芦席的副业生产。书中描写，正是因为祝永康组织了大批的编席互助组，编了大批的芦席，赚了钱，救了灾，才带动了黄泥乡走上“组织起来”的道路。这里可以看出，编席赚钱，是全书作为走社会主义集体化的“道路”而加以宣扬的。书中的主要人物都围着这个问题团团转。
    祝永康的“道路”究竟是什么道路？揭开这批“互助组”的画皮，便不难看出它的本质。
    这批“互助组”组织起来的目的，根本不是为了走社会主义道路，而是为着做“一笔本薄利厚的交易”，使“手头活泛活泛”。
    这批编席组的经营方式，是“自负盈亏”，“各编各的”，“编的多，多赚钱”。为了鼓吹这种经营方式，书中专门安排了祝永康的一大段演说词，又是讲技术，又是讲分账，又是讲“各归各”。说穿了就是一句话：合伙搞单干！陈登科捧出这样的货色冒充“社会主义”，恰好暴露了他们复辟资本主义的罪恶阴谋。
    原来，祝永康组织编芦席和朱锡坤组织人打兔子并没有本质的区别，都是走的一条路：资本主义道路。经过祝永康“改造”了一番的黄泥乡，资本主义的浊流不是减少了，而是泛滥了，不是隐蔽了，而是公开“合法”化了。
    祝永康搞这样的“集体化”，依靠的是些什么人呢？他用秘密活动，私察暗访的方式收罗了一批心腹，掌握了黄泥乡的领导权。这些人，有的是被罢了官、缴了枪的“翻案好汉”；有的是思想落后，迷恋单干的“巾帼英雄”；有的是爱情至上，多愁善感的恋爱迷；还有吃吃喝喝、吹吹捧捧的江湖弟兄。由这些人组成所谓的“领导核心”去搞社会主义，不是活见鬼吗！
    为了标榜祝永康走的是社会主义道路，《风雷》中喋喋不休地宣扬，早在一九五四年，祝永康就在黄泥乡进行了一场“社会主义教育运动”。很明显，这是《风雷》在炮制过程中，随着中国赫鲁晓夫形“左”实右黑货的出笼，而做的精心安排。
    这是一场什么样的运动呢？按照《风雷》的描写，“运动”面临的情况极其复杂，“内部矛盾和外部矛盾纠结在一起”，即中国赫鲁晓夫所胡说的“党内外矛盾交叉”。“运动”的方法是“扎根串连”，“访贫问苦”。“运动”的斗争对象是农村中的“破鞋”和懒汉，而对阶级敌人及其在党内的代理人则千方百计包庇过关。显然，这个“运动”所推行的是一整套的中国赫鲁晓夫形“左”而实右的资产阶级反动路线。
    我们伟大领袖毛主席指出，四清运动的性质是社会主义和资本主义的矛盾，运动的重点是整党内那些走资本主义道路的当权派。运动中必须充分放手发动群众，依靠群众大多数，依靠干部大多数，狠狠打击一小撮阶级敌人。祝永康搞的这场“运动”处处都同毛主席的指示相对抗。黄泥乡进行的这场“运动”，是地地道道的假四清，真复辟。
    毛主席在《炮打司令部》的大字报中尖锐地指出：“联系到一九六二年的右倾和一九六四年形‘左’而实右的错误倾向，岂不是可以发人深醒的吗？”反动小说《风雷》中祝永康这个人物所作的种种表演，正是中国赫鲁晓夫从一九六二年的右倾到一九六四年的形“左”而实右的这条黑线的图解。
    这一切，充分说明了祝永康走的就是资本主义道路。
      寻的什么“父”
    中国赫鲁晓夫在扩大的中央工作会议安徽大组会上恶狠狠地叫嚷：我国三年困难，是什么“三分天灾，七分人祸。”颠倒是非，混淆黑白，污蔑三年经济困难是由我们伟大、光荣、正确的中国共产党造成的。狼子野心，何其毒也！
    反动小说《风雷》完全体现了中国赫鲁晓夫的恶毒用心，把所有的党组织都丑化得一塌糊涂，不是由外向里坏的“垡块”，就是由里向外霉的“花生仁子”。党的领导干部，不是蜕化变质分子，就是阶级异己分子；不是两面派、伪君子，就是“老事务”、糊涂虫。总之，就如同初稿《寻父记》中方艳艳唱《女起解》所暗示的：“洪洞县里无好人！”
    《风雷》对我们党的攻击，特别恶毒地表现在对县委书记方旭东这个人物的塑造上。方旭东，是“黄泥乡”这个“困苦凄凉”世界的最高领导者。陈登科把他所捏造的一切灾祸的根源，都归结到方旭东身上。说他“高高在上，不了解下情”，蹲在“森严”的“衙门”里，忘记了曾经用生命和鲜血救助过自己的人民；说他“主观臆断”，“把矛头对着自己的同志”，残害了任为群那样的“忠良”，包庇、重用了熊彬、朱锡坤那样的权奸。还借贫农何老九之口，大骂方旭东：“你主观！”“你忘本！”“黄泥乡搞成这样，难道你没有责任？”
    骂，陈登科还觉得不足以发泄他对我们无产阶级司令部的仇恨，在第五十一章中，又特地设计了方旭东“翻车”的场面，描写方旭东把社会主义的“大马车”陷入了淤塘，方旭东自己也弄成了“满脸黑”，“好似被人敲了一棒，昏昏沉沉地将头低下……”。这是反动透顶的政治黑话！陈登科做贼心虚，在《风雷》的第二次印刷本中，偷偷摸摸地把“好似被人敲了一棒”这段话删掉了，这样一删，不是更加暴露了他们一伙的反革命马脚吗！反革命分子田汉在大毒草《谢瑶环》中曾经叫嚣：“载舟之水也覆舟”，陈登科在这里也来了一个车陷淤塘，人仰马翻的描写。一个要“覆舟”，一个要“翻车”，在中国赫鲁晓夫及其大小娄罗们看来，无产阶级专政之“舟”快要“覆”了，社会主义的“马车”就要“翻”了，他们篡党复辟的日子就快到了。这批反动家伙的黄粱梦真是做得美极了！
    果然，陈登科在《风雷》中经过精心设计捧出了一个“高大”的形象，这就是资产阶级司令部的理想“英雄”——区委第二书记祝永康。
    祝永康是在“灾荒压顶”，“军心不振、士气涣散”，“粮食紧张”的所谓关键时刻，带着大批“救命”的粮食，从天而降，飘飘飞来的。祝永康的出场，使“阴霾满天”的黄泥乡马上出现了“积雪融化”、“河水解冻，大地回春”的场面，而且在他那“春雷一般轰鸣”的吼声之后，一场闹粮风潮，便立即烟消云散了。《风雷》中的祝永康俨然是一个力能回天的“救世主”！
    毛主席教导我们：“人民，只有人民，才是创造世界历史的动力。”用毛泽东思想武装起来的人民群众，最无私，最无畏，最聪明，最勇敢，再大的灾荒也能战胜，再大的困难也动摇不了他们走社会主义道路的决心。陈登科之所以要烘托祝永康这个人物出场，目的就是要丑化人民群众，吹捧资产阶级的代表人物，攻击社会主义制度，反对我们伟大的党。
    为了强化祝永康这个资产阶级代表人物的“回春”之力，陈登科从头到尾为祝永康安排了一条“寻父”的线索。《风雷》的前身就叫《寻父记》。人们不能不奇怪，为什么一定要在祝永康这个“共产党员”身上，安上封建的报恩情节呢？陈登科曾经自供过：“寻父不是一个生活命题，而是一个政治命题。寻父就是寻找党的真理。”“寻父”，一语泄露了天机，正是揭穿这部小说反动主题的关键。
    什么“寻找党的真理”！在反革命分子陈登科们看来，我们伟大、光荣、正确的中国共产党已经没有“真理”了，这也就是中国赫鲁晓夫疯狂叫嚣的“党的传统遭到了破坏”、“党的威信丧失了”、“官越大，真理越少”这种反动谬论的翻版。
    真理是有阶级性的。马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想，是无产阶级的真理，也就是我们党的真理。毛泽东同志是当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者。毛泽东思想是反对帝国主义和修正主义的强大的思想武器，是革命人民进行革命斗争和社会主义建设的指导方针。中国赫鲁晓夫和他的代理人拚命叫嚷要寻找什么“党的真理”，他们究竟要寻找哪家的“真理”呢？
    且看《风雷》的表白：祝永康走马上任的全部思想动力，是决心沿着“党中央领导人”在淮北这块土地上“留下”的“很深”的“足印”继续前进。
    那个在淮北“足印很深”的人指的究竟是谁呢？查查历史，明白了：这个“足印很深”的人，就是曾经为了逃避抗日斗争而躲在这里的中国赫鲁晓夫。中国赫鲁晓夫，不仅抗日战争时期有在这里当逃兵的“足印”，而且解放后还来淮北转过三次，留下了篡党复辟的“足印”。其中很“深”的一次，就是到濉溪县卧龙公社的卧龙湖。他在这里满口谬论，胡说八道，公然亮出自己的黑货，同伟大领袖毛主席“一定要把淮河修好”的指示相抗衡，破坏了淮北的水系，给淮北人民带来了灾难。书中写祝永康在“视察”卧龙湖时与任为群所商订的“治湖”计划，同中国赫鲁晓夫“指示”的精神是一路货。这不是在追寻中国赫鲁晓夫的“足印”又是什么？！那个祝永康怀恋的是什么人，寻找的是什么“父”，不是一清二楚了吗！
    把《风雷》的反动主题揭到底，在资产阶级司令部一伙反动分子看来，我们伟大的党已经“陷车”了；只有按照中国赫鲁晓夫的“足印”走下去才能“回天”，所以他们要“寻父”。“父”就是中国赫鲁晓夫，他就是资产阶级“真理”的化身，就是那一伙牛鬼蛇神和反革命修正主义分子的“父”，“寻父”就是寻找中国赫鲁晓夫和他那一套反革命修正主义路线，就是要中国赫鲁晓夫篡夺党中央的领导权，复辟资本主义。这就是《寻父记》——《风雷》的要害所在，也是《风雷》包藏的全部祸心。
    中国赫鲁晓夫在扩大的中央工作会议上叫嚷要立的“碑”，就是这样一块篡党复辟的黑碑！
    我们一定要以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，粉碎《风雷》刮起的复辟资本主义的妖风，摧毁《风雷》宣扬的资本主义道路，打倒他们左寻右找的“父”——中国赫鲁晓夫，彻底砸烂他们妄想“传给后代”的黑碑！
    我们的伟大领袖毛主席在最新指示中说：“无产阶级文化大革命，实质上是在社会主义条件下，无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命，是中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续，是无产阶级和资产阶级阶级斗争的继续。”我们对反动小说《风雷》的批判，正是这种斗争的继续。《风雷》中寻的“父”，就是代表国民党反动派利益，代表帝国主义、资产阶级和地、富、反、坏、右利益的中国赫鲁晓夫。《风雷》的炮制者，就是中国赫鲁晓夫及其在安徽的代理人卵翼下的一伙国民党反动派的残渣余孽。这就清楚地表明了我们同他们斗争的实质。
    史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命，已经进入夺取全面胜利的关键时刻。我们无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众，必须更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，深入开展革命大批判，坚决反对右倾机会主义、右倾分裂主义、右倾投降主义，粉碎右倾翻案妖风，坚决把隐藏在革命队伍里的一小撮叛徒、特务、死不悔改的走资派和其他一切反革命分子统统挖出来，把无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命进行到底！
