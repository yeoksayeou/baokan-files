The reactionary government of Japan, led by Sato, has formulated a long-term plan to fully revive Japanese militarism. Recently, Sato Eisaku has repeatedly boasted that in 1970, when the 10-year term of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" expires, he will extend this military alliance between Japan and the U.S. and will engage in even more frantic militarization and armament, including nuclear armament, to accelerate the full revival of Japanese militarism. The facts show that the Sato government is more blatant and frantic in reviving militarism than any previous Japanese cabinet.

The reactionary clique in Japan has a clear policy: under the patronage of U.S. imperialism, they will follow the path of aggression taken by Japanese imperialism in the 1930s. They will not deviate from this policy, nor will they lay down their butcher's knife or suddenly become enlightened.

Looking back, Japanese militarism was once rampant during World War II, boasting of a so-called "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere" and attempting to dominate Asia forever. However, in a short time, the "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere" collapsed, Japanese aggression was defeated, and their leader, Tojo Hideki, committed suicide. Today, Sato Eisaku and his ilk are inheriting Tojo's legacy, carrying the broken banner of a so-called "third founding," and attempting to rise again, replaying the roles of their predecessors.

However, the times have changed. Sato Eisaku and his ilk will not be able to follow the old path of Japanese imperialism. They are deluding themselves.

The U.S.-Japanese reactionaries themselves understand that to make Japan retrace the steps of imperialism, they must first establish a so-called "spiritual pillar" of militarism among the Japanese people. To this end, they are vigorously promoting the revival of militarism in Japan. However, today, the struggle of the Japanese people against the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries is raging like a wildfire. The Japanese people are more awake than ever, and their class consciousness is continuously improving. The revolutionary situation in Japan is developing.

At the same time, the conditions in the entire Asia have fundamentally changed. The existence of great socialist China is an insurmountable obstacle to the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries' attempt to dominate Asia. The fierce burning of the revolutionary flames of the people of Asian countries has made the imperialists and reactionaries tremble with fear. Even the mighty U.S. imperialism has been scorched by the revolutionary fires of the Asian people, let alone Japanese militarism?

Our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out: "The stubborn reactionaries have always met with results contrary to their wishes. They always start by harming others and end up harming themselves."

Sato Eisaku and his ilk insist on following in the footsteps of Tojo Hideki, and the result will inevitably be an even more disgraceful fate than that of their predecessors.

    此路不通
    日本佐藤反动政府为全面复活日本军国主义制订了长远的计划。最近，佐藤荣作一再叫嚣，在一九七○年，即在日美“安全条约”十年期满后，要把这个日美军事同盟条约继续延长下去，并且还要进行更疯狂的扩军备战，包括实行核武装，以更快的速度全面复活日本军国主义。事实表明，佐藤政府在复活军国主义方面，比日本以往任何一届内阁都更加露骨，更加疯狂。
    日本反动派的方针是定了的，那就是，在美帝国主义的扶植下，走三十年代日本帝国主义的侵略老路。它们是决不会改变这个方针，决不会放下屠刀，也决不会立地成佛的。
    回顾当年日本军国主义在第二次世界大战中，何等飞扬跋扈，横行一时，它们打着所谓“大东亚共荣圈”的招牌，妄图永远称霸亚洲。可是，曾几何时，“大东亚共荣圈”完蛋了，日本侵略势力覆没了，它们的头目东条英机自杀了。今天，佐藤荣作之流继承了东条英机的衣钵，扛着所谓
  “第三次创业”的破旗，又要卷土重来，重演他们的前辈所扮演过的角色。
    但是，时代不同了。佐藤荣作之流走日本帝国主义的侵略老路，是绝对走不通的。他们是痴心妄想。
    美日反动派自己也懂得，它们要使日本重走帝国主义的老路，首先要在日本人民中间建立所谓军国主义的“精神支柱”。为此，它们在日本大搞复活军国主义的舆论准备。但是，今天，日本人民反对美日反动派的斗争如火如荼，日本人民空前觉醒，阶级觉悟不断提高，日本革命形势在不断发展。
    同时，整个亚洲的条件也根本不同了。伟大的社会主义中国的存在，是美日反动派妄图称霸亚洲的不可逾越的障碍。亚洲各国人民革命怒火的猛烈燃烧，使帝国主义和反动派丧魂失魄。偌大的一个美帝国主义尚且已经被亚洲人民的革命烈火烧得焦头烂额了，何况是日本军国主义呢？
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席指出：“从来的顽固派，所得的结果，总是和他们的愿望相反。他们总是以损人开始，以害己告终。”
    佐藤荣作之流硬要沿着东条英机的脚印往前走，其结果必然只能得到比他们前辈更可耻的下场。
