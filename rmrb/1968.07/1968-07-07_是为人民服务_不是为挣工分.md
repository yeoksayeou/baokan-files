During the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the members of Hongshimen Brigade studied and applied Chairman Mao's works diligently. Taking the people of Dazhai as their example, they worked hard to change the face of their poor mountain village, transforming the rocky, barren gully into a fertile land.

During those days of battling against nature, the young women Zeng Shuwen and Zeng Xiuying saw that some young and strong brigade members, in order to build socialism, selflessly dug ditches, leveled land, and carried stones up the mountains. Their clothes were torn and they had no time to mend them. The sisters, together with their family, studied the "Three Constantly Read Articles" and followed Chairman Mao's teaching: "All revolutionary comrades must care for each other, love each other, and help each other." They decided that after the autumn harvest distribution, they would cut down on other family expenses and use over a hundred yuan to buy a sewing machine to help the community solve this practical problem.

Over the past year, they have gotten up early and gone to bed late, mending over 200 pieces of clothing for the brigade members without taking a single cent from them or earning a single work point. Some brigade members voluntarily allocated work points to them, but they said: "In our village, many brigade members wholeheartedly serve the people, caring more about the collective than about themselves, and caring more about others than about themselves. We mend clothes to serve the people, not to earn a few work points!"

### 是为人民服务　不是为挣工分

    是为人民服务　不是为挣工分
    在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，我们红石门大队的社员，活学活用毛主席著作，以大寨人为榜样，艰苦奋斗，立志改变穷山村的面貌，把乱石滚滚的荒山沟变成米粮川。
    在那些战天斗地的日子里，女青年訾淑文、訾秀英姐妹俩看到一部分青壮年社员，为了搞好社会主义建设，忘我地闸沟垫地，爬山背石，衣服破了没有工夫补，就和全家的人共同学习“老三篇”，遵照毛主席“一切革命队伍的人都要互相关心，互相爱护，互相帮助”的教导，决定在秋收分配后，压缩全家其他开支，先拿出一百几十元买一架缝纫机，帮助群众解决这个实际问题。
    一年多来，她们早起晚睡，给社员缝补了二百多件衣服，没有收过社员一分钱，没有要过一个工分。有的社员主动给她们拨工分，她们就说：“咱村很多社员，全心全意为人民服务，关心集体比关心个人为重，关心他人比关心自己为重。我们缝补衣服也是为人民服务，可不是为了挣几个工分呵！”
