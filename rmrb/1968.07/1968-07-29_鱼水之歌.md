	The Song of Fish and Water
	North Sea Fleet 344th Detachment

	Opening the "Dumpling Gourd"

	Li Changhang, the militia company commander, is a young man under thirty, strong and upright. His younger brother, Li Changhuang, is the leader of the Red Guards, a young rebel. Since the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the two brothers have led the revolutionary masses of the entire village to follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, adhere to the direction of struggle, and carry out revolutionary production with great enthusiasm. However, during the busy spring planting season last year, Li Changhang suddenly changed his attitude, wanting to hold some kind of meeting and no longer actively participating. The villagers were all puzzled, unable to fathom what was in their gourd.

	At that time, we were working in this village and saw this situation. Deputy Commander Dong Shucai couldn't help but take this "dumpling gourd" to Li Changhang's home. After talking for a while, he only got two meaningless sentences: "My family just needs someone to cook," and "Avoid idle talk, earn more work points." Dong Shucai took this "dumpling gourd" to the fields, working with the villagers and talking heart to heart, finally solving the mystery of the "dumpling gourd."

	It turned out to be like this: Since 1960, Li Changhang has been the militia company commander, and he has been serious in his work, which no one can deny. He is a straightforward person, and if someone has any faults, he would speak up loudly. Some people thought he had good intentions and that what he said made sense, so they accepted it happily. But there were also people who thought he didn't give others face, and although they didn't say it out loud, they were not happy in their hearts. During the Cultural Revolution, everyone gave him some advice, but he couldn't turn the corner at the time and butted heads, feeling that "this is a thankless job."

	Just as he couldn't turn the corner, a strange wind blew from somewhere: "Why be so active? You're not a party member, and in the end, you might end up hurting yourself." This wind blew into Li Changhang's ears, like eating ice cream in the dead of winter, thinking: "Being the company commander is really a thankless job!"

	Li Changhang has four brothers, and he is the eldest. Two younger brothers are still in school. The family has no elders, and he hasn't married yet. Working, attending meetings, busy until midnight, coming home still has to take care of his own food. He never had a word of complaint. Uncles and aunts all said: "This child only thinks of us." But now, after hearing some advice and a cold wind, as soon as he entered the door, he felt chaotic, and his mind was in turmoil: With our strength, if we go to sea to fish, we can definitely earn big work points, finish work and go home, and also take care of this family. Personalism occupied his mind, and Li Changhang decided to "throw in the towel."

	Dong Shucai found out the truth and went to Li Changhang's home, studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions on correctly handling relations with the masses, recalling bitterness and sweetness, fighting against selfishness and criticizing revisionism, guiding him to "think of three things, look at three things, and compare three things": Think of the trust and expectations of the poor and lower-middle peasants, compare with Chairman Mao's teachings on correctly handling relations with the masses, and see if his attitude towards the masses' criticism is good or bad; think of the bitterness of the poor and powerless in the old society, compare with Chairman Mao's teachings on the issue of political power, and see if he holds the gun and the seal firmly; think of the revolutionary mission, compare with Chairman Mao's teachings on carrying the revolution through to the end, and see if his feet are steady.

	This way, Li Changhang finally understood that selfishness had clouded his mind. He excitedly said: "It's fortunate that you brought Chairman Mao's instructions, pulling me out of the mud. I am the son of a poor peasant, and Chairman Mao teaches me to be a servant of the people. Now, the masses criticize me a little, and I want to throw in the towel, which is disloyal to Chairman Mao." He actively made a public self-criticism among the masses and cadres. The masses were very happy and welcomed him with applause.

	Several other "lying down" cadres in the village were also inspired and encouraged. The whole village united as one, full of joy, and the spring planting production immediately became very lively.

	In a Critical Moment

	One day, we were having breakfast when the village poor peasants' association chairman, Wang Zehong, rushed up the mountain, shouting: "Navy comrades, something terrible has happened! Quick, quick! Save people!" Military doctor Wang Xiancai immediately put down the bowl he had just picked up, rushed to support the old woman, and asked what happened. Wang Zehong panted, saying in fits and starts: "Yuan's mother took the wrong medicine, poisoned..." Wang Xiancai couldn't help but gasp, not waiting for the old woman to finish, he picked up the medicine bag and left. Commander Niu Shuting wanted to say a few words to him, but he had already rushed down the mountain like a gust of wind.

	At this time, the comrades let Wang Zehong sit down and drink water, and she finally told the whole story from beginning to end.

	In the old society, poor peasant Yuan Xiueying worked like an ox and horse, could only rely on seaweed to fill her stomach, and over time, she got stomach problems. After liberation, Yuan Xiueying had a great turnaround in politics and economy, her awareness greatly improved, but the stomach problems often acted up and never completely healed. These days, the old illness relapsed, and the medicine bottle was never out of her hand.

	It so happened that the night before, her daughter Li Xinli returned from work, passing by the supply and marketing cooperative, bought a bottle of "DDVP," and casually placed it on the small table by the kang. At dawn, Yuan Xiueying was in great pain, picked up the medicine bottle, and gulped down a big mouthful. She felt her tongue numb, and the medicine had already gone down her throat. She felt the medicine taste was different, quickly woke up her daughter. The daughter picked up the medicine bottle and saw that her mother had drunk DDVP, scared to tears, hugging her mother who was sweating profusely on her forehead, and cried.

	Just as Li Xinli was in a panic, not knowing what to do, Dr. Wang rushed to Yuan Xiueying's home. He saw the old woman covering her stomach, gritted her teeth, and beads of sweat rolled down her forehead. Dr. Wang said nothing, immediately checked her pulse, took her temperature, gave her medicine, poured soup, and injected... Soon, the political instructor Xu Zhenyan also rushed to the old woman's home and told Dr. Wang: "The party branch has decided to divide into three teams: you stay here to rescue; we have already reported to the higher authorities, and if necessary, we will request assistance; we are also preparing at home, comrades say, if people are needed, there are people, if blood is needed, there is blood." Dr. Wang firmly replied: "I will definitely learn from Comrade Norman Bethune, do my best to rescue, and please rest assured with the higher authorities and comrades!"

	From dawn to dusk, Dr. Wang stayed by Yuan Xiueying's side, forgetting his own hunger and fatigue. Only when she gradually fell into a peaceful sleep, the white moonlight spread over the hillside, did Dr. Wang return to the camp with peace of mind.

	The next morning, facing the rising sun, the villagers, carrying Chairman Mao's portrait, holding letters of thanks, waving red flags, beating drums and gongs, surged up the mountain. Li Xinli, with tears in her eyes, shouted loudly: "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!" She pulled Dr. Wang's hand, excitedly unable to speak, and later only said repeatedly: "Learn from the People's Liberation Army! Pay tribute to the People's Liberation Army!"

	Military Love for the People, People Support the Military, Military and People United as One Family

	The story of the villagers' support and help for us is endless, even if it takes days and nights to tell.

	Our camp's water supply is extremely scarce, and we have to go down the mountain for two li to get it. Last winter, the small reservoir was almost dry. The cooks harnessed the horse cart to go down the mountain to fetch water, but it happened to be a heavy snow, the snow was knee-deep, and the horse cart could not move an inch. The cooks were ready to carry the water with poles on their shoulders. They had not walked a few steps when they saw a cow cart slowly coming up the steep slope. Commander Cui took a closer look and saw that the driver was the leader of the third production team, Li Shijie.

	Li Shijie left home early in the morning, looked up, and saw the mountain top was white, looked down, and saw the ground covered with thick snow. He turned around, his eyes fell on the water jar, immediately thought of the difficulty the PLA must have in getting water. He quickly ran to the core militia Li Fawu's home. Li Fawu was just preparing the water buckets, seeing Li Shijie running over, said: "Quick, go send water to the navy!" Li Shijie punched Li Fawu's broad and solid shoulder: "We both thought of the same thing! But carrying water is too slow, the horse cart is difficult to move, come, let's harness the cow cart!"

	Another time, we used the morning exercise time to go down the mountain to fetch water. Halfway, we met the militia company commander Li Changhang. Without saying a word, he blew the trumpet towards the village. In an instant, more than a hundred people from the village came out. Li Changhang said only one sentence: "There is no water on the mountain, what should we do?" "Send!" More than a hundred people answered in unison. They carried Chairman Mao's colorful portrait, held up red flags, braved the north wind, and stepped on the knee-deep snow, singing "The Great Helmsman Guides Us Across the Seas" and shouting "The military and the people are united as one, see who can defeat us," marching in a grand procession to send water up the mountain.

	The children in the village were not willing to fall behind. They were small but had big aspirations, always regarding doing one more thing for the PLA as their duty and honor. The Little Red Guards Li Lifen, Li Aili, and their classmates formed the "Support the Military Little Group," often coming up the mountain to sing songs praising Chairman Mao, dance dances praising Chairman Mao, and then going to the soldiers' dormitories to find dirty clothes to wash. The soldiers warmly welcomed them to spread Mao Zedong Thought, but they would not let the Little Red Guards wash clothes. Often, the Little Red Guards would pout, and the old soldiers would have to mobilize everyone to make a little concession, handing over one or two pieces. Washing clothes seems like a small matter, but the people's intentions are deep and long. The Little Red Guards who grew up in the new society expressed their love for Chairman Mao with their agile little hands and expressed their deep feelings for the PLA.

     打开“闷葫芦”
    民兵连长李长航是个不到三十岁的棒小伙子，身强力壮，为人正直。他弟弟李长厢是红卫兵的“头头”，一员小闯将。无产阶级文化大革命以来，哥俩带领着全村革命群众，紧跟毛主席伟大战略部署，坚持斗争大方向，全村革命生产热火朝天。可是在去年春耕大忙季节，李长航忽然一反常态，要开个什么会，再也不积极参加了。社员们都很纳闷了，摸不透他们葫芦里装的是什么。
    当时我们正在这村劳动，把这情形看在眼里。副站长董树才忍不住就带着这个“闷葫芦”到李长航家去了。谈来谈去，只得到了两句没头没脑的话：“我家正好缺个做饭的”，“少挣闲气，多挣工分”。董树才又带着这个“闷葫芦”到田间地头，和社员边劳动，边谈心，终于解开了这个“闷葫芦”。
    原来是这样：李长航自从一九六○年当民兵连长以来，办事认真，这是谁也没话说的。他是个“直肠子”，谁要有个什么不是，他就要粗声粗气地说上几句。有的人觉得他是一片好心，说的也在理，高高兴兴地接受了。可也有的人觉得他不给人留面子，嘴里不说，心里却不痛快。文化大革命中，大家给他提了些意见，他一时转不过弯来，顶了牛，觉得“这是个得罪人的差事”。
    正在他转不过弯的时候，不知从哪个阴沟里冒出一股风：“你积极个啥？又不是个党员，弄来弄去，保不住最后弄到你自己头上。”这股风吹到李长航耳朵里，好似十冬腊月吃冰棍，心想：“干这个连长，可真是吃力不讨好！”
    李长航弟兄四个，他是老大。两个小弟弟还在上学。家里既没个老的，又没娶媳妇。劳动，开会，忙到半夜，回家来还得自己拾掇吃的。他从来也没半句怨言。大爷、大娘们都说：“这孩子心里就想着俺们大伙。”可这会儿，听了点意见，灌了点冷风，一进家门，就觉得乱糟糟的，脑海里翻腾着：凭咱哥俩这副身子骨，要是出海打鱼，管保挣大工分，收工就回家，也好拾掇拾掇这个家。思想上个人主义占了上风，李长航就决定“撂挑子”了。
    董树才摸清了底细就到李长航家，同他一起学习毛主席关于正确对待群众问题的最新指示，一起忆苦思甜，一起斗私批修，引导他“三想、三看、三对照”：想贫下中农对自己的信任和期望，对照毛主席关于正确对待群众的教导，看自己对待群众批评的态度好不好；想旧社会里穷人无权之苦，对照毛主席关于政权问题的教导，看自己掌握枪杆子、印把子牢不牢；想革命重任，对照毛主席关于将革命进行到底的教导，看自己的脚跟稳不稳。
    这么一来，李长航终于开窍了，明白“私”字迷了自己的心。他激动地说：“亏得你们送来了毛主席的指示，把我从泥坑里拔了出来。我是贫农的儿子，毛主席教我要做人民群众的勤务员。现今群众批评一下我就想撂挑子不干，这就是对毛主席的不忠。”他主动地在群众和干部中公开作了检查。群众很高兴，都拍着巴掌欢迎。
    村里其他几个“躺”下的干部，也受到了启发和鼓舞。全村上下一心，一片欢腾，春耕生产顿时搞得热火朝天。
  在危急的时刻
    一天，我们正在吃早饭，村贫协主任王泽凤大娘气急败坏地跑上山来，边跑边嚷：“海军同志，不得了啦！快快！快救人！”军医王鲜才立即放下刚端起的碗筷，赶去搀扶大娘，问是怎么回事。王大娘喘着气，断断续续地说：“袁大娘吃错了药，中毒啦！……”王鲜才不由倒抽一口冷气，不等大娘说完，背起药包就走。站长牛书亭想给他说几句话，他早已一阵风似地下了山。
    这时，同志们让王大娘坐下，让她喝水，她才从头到尾说了个清楚。
    贫农大娘袁秀英在旧社会里当牛作马，只能靠海菜撑饱肚子，时间一长，就得下了胃病。解放后，袁大娘在政治上、经济上大翻身，觉悟大大提高，可是胃病时时发作，一直没能断根。这些日子，老病复发，药瓶子不离手。
    事又凑巧，头天晚上，闺女李新丽收工回家，路过供销社，买了一瓶“敌敌畏”，顺手放到炕头小桌上。天蒙蒙亮，袁大娘胃痛难忍，拿起药瓶，“骨碌”一声咽了一大口，只觉得舌根一阵发麻，药水已经下了肚。她感到药味不同，赶忙叫醒闺女。闺女拿起药瓶一看，原来娘喝的是敌敌畏，吓得眼泪直淌，抱着额上直冒大汗的妈妈，哭了起来。
    正在李新丽手忙脚乱，不知如何是好的时候，王医生赶到了袁大娘家。只见大娘捂着肚子，咬紧牙关，额上豆大的汗珠往下直淌。王医生二话没说，立即试脉搏、量体温、服药、灌汤、注射……。不久，指导员徐振彦也赶到了大娘家，对王医生说：“支部决定，兵分三路：你在这里抢救；我们已经报告上级，必要时请求援助；我们同时在家里准备，同志们说，要人有人，要血有血。”王医生坚定地答道：“我一定向白求恩同志学习，尽全力抢救，请上级和同志们放心！”
    从清晨到黄昏，王医生一直守在袁大娘身旁，把自己的饥饿和疲劳都忘了。直等她渐渐安详地睡着了，洁白的月光洒满了山坡，王医生才放心地回到了驻地。
    第二天一早，迎着初升的太阳，这个村的民兵和社员，抬着毛主席像，拿着感谢信，举着红旗，敲锣打鼓涌上山来。李新丽满眶热泪地使劲高呼：“毛主席万岁！万万岁！”她拉着王医生的手激动得说不出话来，后来只是连连说出一句：“向解放军学习！向解放军致敬！”送水洗衣一片情
    军爱民，民拥军，军民亲如一家人。这个村群众对我们支持、帮助的故事，几天几夜也说不完。
    我们驻地的吃水奇缺，要跑到山下二里地才能弄到。去年冬天，眼看着小水库就见了底。炊事班的同志套上马车准备下山取水，可是，正赶上了一场大雪，雪深没膝，马车寸步难行。炊事班几个同志准备每人一根扁担两条腿，下山挑。刚走没几步，只见一辆牛车沿着陡坡缓缓而上。崔班长定睛一看，赶车人正是第三生产队队长李世杰。
    李世杰清晨出门，抬头望，山顶一片白，低头看，大地铺厚雪。一转身，眼光落到水缸上，马上想起解放军吃水一定有困难。他连忙跑到基干民兵李法为家。李法为正在拾掇水桶，见李世杰跑来，就说：“快，给海军送水去！”李世杰一拳打在李法为宽厚坚实的肩头上：“俺俩想的一个样！可是挑水太慢，马车难行，走，套牛车去！”
    另一次，我们利用早操时间下山挑水，半道上碰见了民兵连长李长航。他二话没说，冲着村子吹响了小号。只一忽儿，村子里出动了一百多人。李长航就说了一句话：“山上没水了，咋办？”“送！”一百多人同时回答。他们抬着毛主席的彩色画像，举着红旗，冒着北风，踏着齐膝深的积雪，高唱着《大海航行靠舵手》，高呼着“军民团结如一人，试看天下谁能敌”，浩浩荡荡送水上山。
    村里的孩子们也不甘落后，他们人小志大，总是把为解放军多做一件事看作是本份、是光荣。红小兵李丽芬、李爱丽和同学们组成了“拥军小组”，常常到山上来唱歌颂毛主席的歌，跳歌颂毛主席的舞，然后到战士的宿舍里找脏衣服拿去洗。战士们热烈地欢迎她们宣传毛泽东思想，可是说什么也不让红小兵给洗衣服。往往是红小兵们鼓着小嘴不乐意了，老战士才不得不动员大家，稍作退让，交出一两件来。洗衣服，看来是小事，然而群众的心意又深又长。生长在新社会的红小兵用她们那灵巧的小手表达了红小兵对毛主席的热爱，表达了红小兵对解放军的深厚感情。
