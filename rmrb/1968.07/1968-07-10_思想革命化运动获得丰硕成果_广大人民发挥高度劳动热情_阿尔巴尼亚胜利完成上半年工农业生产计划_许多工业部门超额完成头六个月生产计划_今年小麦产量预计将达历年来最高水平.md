The heroic people of Albania, under the wise leadership of Comrade Enver Hoxha, the great leader of the Albanian people, and the Albanian Party of Labour, have, on the basis of striving to realize the revolutionization of national life and of people's ideology, displayed high enthusiasm for labor and successfully completed the national industrial and agricultural production plans for the first half of this year.

According to materials from the Albanian State Planning Commission, the completion of the national economic plans by various sectors this half-year has been better than at any other time. Workers in the industrial sector have completed and overfulfilled the production tasks for the first six months of this year. The electric power industry overfulfilled the plan by 7.1 percent; the machinery industry also overfulfilled the plan; oil workers produced approximately 12,000 additional tons of oil and 13,000 tons of asphalt; chromium miners completed 103.9 percent of the plan; coal miners produced an additional 4,000 tons of coal. Workers at the Stalin Oil Combine are now already working on tasks for the end of this year, and a production brigade at the Patos Oil Company is currently working on tasks for 1970.

Geological survey workers have traversed mountains and valleys, working selflessly, and have achieved good results in completing the mineral survey plan. They have discovered a new copper mine this half-year.

Workers at the Lazar Fertilizer Plant and the Ferik Nitrogen Fertilizer Plant, who are directly responsible for supporting agricultural production, have, in order to produce more fertilizers to support agriculture, overfulfilled the plan by approximately 5,500 tons of phosphate fertilizer and 2,400 tons of nitrogen fertilizer this half-year. Workers at the Vlorë Soda Plant have also achieved excellent production results.

Transportation and communication workers have displayed revolutionary vigor, often working day and night, and have overfulfilled the road freight plan for the first six months of this year by 15 percent, and the railway freight plan by approximately 10 percent. The passenger transport plan has also been overfulfilled.

This half-year, the construction sector has completed 21 percent more construction and installation tasks compared to the same period last year. Construction workers, in order to accelerate the construction of important projects such as the "Mao Zedong Textile Combine" dyeing and weaving workshops, the Elbasan Cement Plant, and others, have worked tirelessly. At the same time, in the construction of irrigation projects in the Durres region, drainage projects in the Korça region, and other water conservancy projects, good results have been achieved.

The light industry sector's textile, papermaking, timber, food, and shoe production have all overfulfilled the plans for the first half of this year.

While completing production tasks, the broad masses of workers have actively implemented the resolutions of the Third Plenum of the Albanian Party of Labour, launched a movement for technological innovation and rationalization proposals, and achieved new results in improving product quality, increasing product varieties, reducing production costs, and saving raw materials. Workers in the Vlorë region have proposed more than a thousand rationalization proposals in the first five months of this year, of which more than 400 have been adopted.

Under the leadership of the Party, the broad masses of agricultural cooperatives and state farm workers have been widely mobilized to overcome various difficulties caused by unfavorable weather in the first half of this year. Due to the care of the Party and the government, the efforts of agricultural workers, and the support of city people, the spring sowing and summer planting this year have generally been faster than last year, and cotton planting has been advanced by one month compared to last year. In order to achieve high yields of wheat, corn, and other crops, agricultural workers have carried out a large amount of work in deep plowing, drainage, fertilization, intertilling, and weeding. It is estimated that the wheat yield this year will reach the highest level in history.

    许多工业部门超额完成头六个月生产计划　今年小麦产量预计将达历年来最高水平
    新华社地拉那九日电英雄的阿尔巴尼亚人民，在以阿尔巴尼亚人民的伟大领袖霍查同志为首的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党的英明领导下，在努力实现国家生活和人的思想革命化的基础上，发挥了高度的劳动热情，胜利地完成了今年上半年的工农业生产计划。
    据阿尔巴尼亚国家计划委员会的材料估计，今年上半年国民经济各部门完成国家计划的情况比以往任何时候都好。工业部门职工完成和超额完成了今年头六个月的生产任务。电力工业超额完成计划百分之七点一；机械工业也超额完成了计划；石油工人超额生产石油约一万二千吨，石油沥青一万三千吨；铬矿工人完成计划百分之一百零三点九；煤矿工人超额生产了四千吨煤。斯大林石油联合工厂矿区的职工现在已经在做今年九月底的工作，帕托斯石油公司的一个生产队目前已经在做一九七○年的工作。
    地质勘察工作者翻山越岭，忘我劳动，在完成矿藏勘察计划方面取得了良好的成绩。他们今年上半年又发现了一个新的铜矿。
    直接担负着支援农业生产任务的拉兹磷肥厂和费里氮肥厂职工，为了更多地生产化肥支援农业，今年上半年超计划生产约五千五百吨磷肥和二千四百吨氮肥。发罗拉制碱厂职工也取得了优异的生产成绩。
    交通运输部门的职工发扬革命干劲，经常日夜兼程，超额百分之十五完成了今年头六个月的公路货运计划，超额约百分之十完成了铁路货运计划。客运计划也超额完成。
    今年上半年，建筑部门所完成的建筑安装任务与去年同期相比，增长了百分之二十一。建筑工人为加速建设“毛泽东纺织联合工厂”的染纱车间和色织车间、爱尔巴桑水泥厂等重要工程项目，进行了不倦的劳动。与此同时，在建设都拉斯区的灌溉工程、科尔察区的排灌工程以及其它水利工程方面，都取得了良好的成果。
    轻工业部门的纺织、造纸、木材、食品和制鞋等项生产，也都超额完成了今年上半年的计划。
    广大职工在完成生产任务的同时，积极贯彻阿尔巴尼亚劳动党三中全会决议，开展技术革新和合理化建议运动，在提高产品质量、增加产品品种、降低生产成本和节约原材料等方面，都取得了新的成果。发罗拉区的职工今年头五个月就提出了上千条的合理化建议，其中四百多条已经被采用。
    广大农业合作社社员和国营农场工人，在党的领导下，广泛地动员起来，战胜了今年上半年因不良气候造成的种种困难。由于党和政府的关怀，农业劳动者的努力和城市人民的支援，今年春播和夏种速度一般都比去年快，仅种植棉花就比去年提早一个月。为了获得小麦、玉米和其它作物的高产，农业劳动者在深耕、排水、施肥、中耕和除草方面进行了大量的工作。预计今年小麦的产量将达到历年来最高的水平。
