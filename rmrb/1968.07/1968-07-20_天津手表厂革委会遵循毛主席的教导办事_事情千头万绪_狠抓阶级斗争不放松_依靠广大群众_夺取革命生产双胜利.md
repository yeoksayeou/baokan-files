The Tianjin Watch Factory Revolutionary Committee, with the help of the People's Liberation Army Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team stationed at the factory, has been vigorously promoting revolution and production. Since May, the quantity and quality of its products have reached the highest levels since the factory's establishment, achieving dual victories in revolution and production.

After the establishment of the Tianjin Watch Factory Revolutionary Committee, the committee members, under the guidance of the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team, followed Chairman Mao's instruction that "the most fundamental principle in reforming state organs is to link up with the masses." They went to the workshops and teams to promote revolution and production alongside the revolutionary masses. Amidst the myriad of tasks, the committee members have not relaxed their grip on class struggle. They set up Mao Zedong Thought study classes in the workshops and teams, focusing on class struggle, and held exhibitions on class struggle to educate the broad revolutionary masses on class struggle and the struggle between the two lines. The revolutionary workers significantly enhanced their awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines, conducted in-depth and sustained revolutionary criticism, and launched attacks on a handful of class enemies, uncovering a few hidden class enemies. This strengthened the newly established revolutionary committee and promoted production.

The escapement workshop is a crucial workshop in the watch factory, but since its establishment, production has never improved. Some people said, "To change the backward situation of the workshop, you would need to add machines, replace equipment, bring in experts, and transfer personnel." However, with the help of the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team, the committee members followed Chairman Mao's instruction that "class struggle, once grasped, works wonders." They mobilized the masses to focus on class struggle and discovered that the reason the workshop's production was lagging was not due to any other factor but a hidden counter-revolutionary element sabotaging production. They mobilized revolutionary workers to expose this counter-revolutionary element and linked his crimes to the counter-revolutionary revisionist black goods of China's Khrushchev. They conducted a revolutionary criticism, greatly raising the class consciousness of all the workers in the workshop, making the workshop's revolution roar with vigor, and gradually improving production, completely changing the previous backward production situation.

During the revolutionary criticism, while fiercely criticizing China's Khrushchev's theory of "extinguishing class struggle," the revolutionary workers also focused on criticizing China's Khrushchev's "crawling philosophy" in technological development and other counter-revolutionary revisionist black goods. Previously, the material preparation workshop had only one imported grinding machine, which not only produced low-quality products but also could not meet the supply demands. After the establishment of the revolutionary committee, the workshop workers proposed to make their own grinding machines. At this time, a handful of capitalist roaders secretly obstructed and sabotaged the trial production of the grinding machine. The revolutionary workers realized that this was a fierce class struggle. Under the leadership of the revolutionary committee members who went deep into the workshop, they conducted a revolutionary criticism of China's Khrushchev's counter-revolutionary revisionist management path for running enterprises and the enterprise management system that served this revisionist path. They further established a spirit of self-reliance and striving for progress, and enthusiastically engaged in the trial production of the grinding machine. After arduous efforts, they finally successfully produced a grinding machine in May this year. After inspection, the quality and efficiency of this grinding machine surpassed the imported one.

    天津手表厂革委会遵循毛主席的教导办事
    事情千头万绪  狠抓阶级斗争不放松
    依靠广大群众  夺取革命生产双胜利
    新华社天津十九日电　天津手表厂革命委员会在驻厂解放军毛泽东思想宣传队的帮助下，狠抓革命，猛促生产，五月份以来，产品数量和质量都达到了建厂以来的最高水平，取得了革命、生产双胜利。
    天津手表厂革委会成立以后，革委会成员在毛泽东思想宣传队的帮助下，遵照毛主席关于“国家机关的改革，最根本的一条，就是联系群众”的教导，分头下到车间、班组，和革命群众一起抓革命、促生产。在千头万绪的工作中，革委会成员狠抓阶级斗争不放松。他们在车间、班组办起了以狠抓阶级斗争为中心内容的毛泽东思想学习班，还举办了阶级斗争展览，向广大革命群众进行阶级斗争和两条路线斗争教育。广大革命职工大大提高了阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟，深入持久地开展革命大批判，主动向一小撮阶级敌人发动进攻，挖出了一小撮暗藏的阶级敌人，巩固了新生的革命委员会，促进了生产。
    擒纵车间是手表厂的重要车间，但从建厂以来，生产一直上不去。有人说：“要想改变车间的落后面貌，除非添机器，换设备，来专家，调人员。”但是，革委会成员在毛泽东思想宣传队的帮助下，遵照毛主席“阶级斗争，一抓就灵”的教导，发动群众，狠抓阶级斗争，结果发现这个车间生产上不去，并不是什么别的原因，而是隐藏在车间里的一个反革命分子在破坏生产。他们发动革命职工挖出了这个反革命分子，并且把他的桩桩罪行同中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义黑货联系起来，开展了革命的大批判，大大提高了全车间工人的阶级觉悟，使这个车间革命轰轰烈烈，生产逐月上升，彻底改变了过去生产落后的面貌。
    在革命大批判中，革命职工在狠批中国赫鲁晓夫“阶级斗争熄灭”论的同时，又着重批判了中国赫鲁晓夫在技术发展上推行的“爬行哲学”等反革命修正主义黑货。过去，配料车间只有一台进口的研磨机，不但生产的产品质量低，而且老是供应不上。革委会成立以后，车间职工提出要自己动手制造研磨机。这时，一小撮走资派就在暗中百般阻拦和破坏研磨机的试制。革命职工认识到，这是一场激烈的阶级斗争。他们在深入车间的革委会成员带领下，对中国赫鲁晓夫推行的反革命修正主义办企业路线和为这条修正主义路线服务的企业管理制度，进行了革命的大批判，进一步树立了自力更生，奋发图强的雄心壮志，意气风发地投入到研磨机的试制工作中。最后经过艰苦奋战，终于在今年五月试制成功了一台研磨机，经鉴定这台研磨机的质量和效率都超过了进口货。
