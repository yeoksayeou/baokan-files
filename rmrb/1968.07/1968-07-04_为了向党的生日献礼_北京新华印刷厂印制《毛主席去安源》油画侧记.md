Sunflowers bloom towards the sun, red hearts towards the Party. Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! On the occasion of the 47th anniversary of the Party's glorious birthday, people have so many heartfelt words to say to you, so many passionate songs to sing! The workers all report their outstanding achievements in seizing the revolution and promoting production to you, dear leader!

On the eve of July 1st, the Beijing New China Printing Factory received the most honorable task: to rush-print a large quantity of the "Chairman Mao Goes to Anyuan" oil painting to celebrate the Party's 47th anniversary.

The good news was like a spring thunder, shaking the New China Printing Factory. This is an extremely honorable political task, this is a tough battle! The members of the Revolutionary Committee and the military representatives stationed at the factory immediately sprang into action and made arrangements. Although the task was urgent, the time was tight, and the quality requirements were high, they firmly believed that the workers, tempered by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, with their boundless loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, would definitely overcome all difficulties and successfully complete this glorious and arduous political task. They made a vow: "Actions speak louder than words. We will use Mao Zedong Thought to direct the battle!"

The good news reached the workshops, and the workers on the night shift were overjoyed; the news reached the dormitories, and the workers immediately put down their bowls; the female workers who were handling household chores immediately dropped what they were doing. People rushed to the factory workshops, each step filled with boundless loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao. Everyone regarded completing this arduous task as the greatest happiness and the greatest honor!

The workshops were boiling over. The workers were criticizing the crimes of the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in the factory who had long obstructed and opposed the printing of Chairman Mao's works and portraits. The more the workers criticized, the more they hated the Chinese Khrushchev, and the more they loved the great leader Chairman Mao, thus unleashing boundless energy. They all expressed their determination: armed with Mao Zedong Thought, the printing workers are the soldiers of propagating Mao Zedong Thought. To timely deliver the glorious image of "Chairman Mao Goes to Anyuan" to the people of the entire country, we will resolutely overcome all difficulties, boldly use new technologies, and print Chairman Mao's color portraits to express our loyalty!

In an instant, the entire factory was in high spirits. Pledges and victory reports hung all over the workshops. The workers put forward battle slogans that echoed through the heavens: We will, with the highest political enthusiasm, the greatest revolutionary spirit, the best quality, the fastest speed, and the most outstanding results, offer gifts to the Party's 47th anniversary and report to the great leader Chairman Mao!

On the eve of the glorious holiday, the Beijing New China Printing Factory was filled with a fervent revolutionary atmosphere. The workers, filled with revolutionary enthusiasm, plunged into the intense battle! The military representatives stationed at the factory insisted on using Mao Zedong Thought as the guiding principle, emphasizing proletarian politics. They timely sent Chairman Mao's quotations to the workshops and to the workers, and fought alongside the workers.

The phototypesetting workers were engaged in the first process of intense labor. At this moment, everyone's emotions were particularly stirred, and the operations were particularly careful. Because phototypesetting is a key process in the entire printing process, they deeply felt the heavy responsibility they bore.

The proofreaders sat by their workstations, gazing at the radiant image of the sun in their hearts on the glass plate, their emotions surging: "Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! In 1921, for the revolutionary cause of the Chinese people, you personally went to Anyuan, igniting the blazing revolutionary flames, and opening the path to victory for the liberation struggle of the working class. Yet the great traitor and scoundrel Chinese Khrushchev shamelessly appropriates the credit of heaven, attempting to revise history and cover up his old revolutionary face. This is absolutely impossible! A thousand times impossible! Ten thousand times impossible!"

The proofreaders, with surging emotions, felt the weight of their responsibility. They felt that the pen in their hands was no longer an ordinary proofreading pen. They used this pen to depict the radiant image of our great leader Chairman Mao in the painting more vividly, and to depict the magnificent background more grand and magnificent. They used this pen to express their boundless faith, love, and admiration for Chairman Mao. Every stroke and every second were expressions of loyalty and devotion.

The workers deeply understood that in printing the glorious image of our great leader, they must strive for perfection. At the same time, to enable the people of the entire country to see the "Chairman Mao Goes to Anyuan" painting as soon as possible, they had to break the rules and find the fastest speed.

In the flatbed printing workshop, there were two copying machines. In the past, it was almost unimaginable for both machines to operate simultaneously. Previously, copying a set of plates took two hours, and if nine sets of plates were to be copied, it would take twelve hours. Such a long time was absolutely not allowed for the current urgent task. "We will express our love for the great leader Chairman Mao with every second!" The workers, after discussion, started both copying machines, operating them simultaneously, and in just four and a half hours, created the miracle of the fastest speed in the workshop: same-day plate making and same-day finished product.

The phototypesetting process encountered a difficulty: due to the humid air, the base plate could not dry quickly in the dryer. What to do? The worker comrades did not want to delay this solemn printing task by even a second. So they brought out electric fans, holding them by hand to dry the base plates.

The workers in the printing workshop had already done a series of meticulous preparations while the plate-making process was in full swing. It was already late at night, and they were all excitedly gathered around the printing machines arranged in a long snake-like formation. At this moment, they felt particularly happy. Before the Cultural Revolution, due to the obstruction of the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in the New China Printing Factory, most of the machines could not be used to print the portraits of our great leader Chairman Mao. Therefore, for many years, many veteran workers had been eagerly waiting for the day when they could print the color portraits of our great leader Chairman Mao. Now this happy moment had finally arrived, and they said with tears of joy: "Without the great leader Chairman Mao, there would be no today for the working class. The Chinese Khrushchev and his agents are most afraid of us printing the glorious image of Chairman Mao. Today, we will print the 'Chairman Mao Goes to Anyuan' oil painting with the best quality and the fastest speed, giving the Chinese Khrushchev a resounding slap in the face!" They broke away from the old frameworks and created a method of "flow production" with multiple machines for color matching.

The workers in the gravure printing workshop were busy repairing two high-speed rotary machines to contribute to the printing of the "Chairman Mao Goes to Anyuan" oil painting. These two machines, due to the obstruction and sabotage of a handful of capitalist roaders within the party, had been out of use for ten years, and some parts had rusted. Today, under the leadership of the proletarian revolutionary faction, it had returned to the hands of the workers and was about to play a huge role.

Under the united efforts of the entire factory, after a period of intense battle, the high-speed rotary machines that had been dormant for ten years started to run. Red hearts beat in time with the machine's rhythm, and eyes shone with joy as they watched the flowing "ribbons." The workers, holding the "Chairman Mao Goes to Anyuan" color oil paintings they had personally printed, solemnly gazed at the red sun illuminating Anyuan Mountain. Our great teacher Chairman Mao, full of vigor and enthusiasm, strides forward, dusty and resolute! Anyuan Mountain cheers, and the Pingxi River sings! The history of Anyuan has undergone a great turning point, and the workers' movement has since taken the correct path. Looking at this painting, the workers' blood boiled, and their spirits soared. Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! Your great wisdom is beyond praise. Looking at this painting, the workers were full of vigor and fighting spirit. Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! The great strategic deployment you personally initiated in Anyuan will forever inspire us. Today, we resolutely follow your great strategic deployment and strive for a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The sun rises, shining brightly. The glorious 47th anniversary of the great, glorious, and correct Communist Party of China has arrived. The Beijing New China Printing Factory has printed a large number of "Chairman Mao Goes to Anyuan" oil paintings. Almost at the same time, the Foreign Languages Printing Factory, Beijing Offset Printing Factory, Beijing Printing Factory No. 4, and more than ten other printing factories also sent in victory reports of printing the "Chairman Mao Goes to Anyuan" oil painting.

We, the propagandists of Mao Zedong Thought on the printing front, amidst the cheers of "Long live Chairman Mao" and the deafening drumbeats, presented the most precious gifts to the most beloved great leader Chairman Mao, to the great Communist Party of China founded by Chairman Mao, and to the glorious 47th anniversary of the Party.

    为了向党的生日献礼
    ——北京新华印刷厂印制《毛主席去安源》油画侧记
    朵朵葵花朝太阳，颗颗红心向着党。毛主席啊，毛主席！在纪念党的四十七周年光辉生日的日子里，人们有多少贴心的话要对您讲，有多少热情的歌要给您唱！工人们都以抓革命促生产的优异成绩，向您老人家报喜！
      “七一”前夕，北京新华印刷厂接受了一项最光荣的任务：赶印大量的《毛主席去安源》油画，向党的四十七周年生日献礼。
    喜讯象一声春雷，震荡着新华印刷厂。这是一项极其光荣的政治任务，这是一场艰巨的战斗！厂革委会成员和驻厂解放军支左人员，闻风而动，立即进行部署。虽然任务急，时间紧，质量要求高，但是他们坚信，经过无产阶级文化大革命锻炼的工人们，凭着一颗对伟大领袖毛主席的无限忠诚的红心，一定能够排除万难，圆满地完成这一项光荣而艰巨的政治任务。他们立下了誓言：“忠不忠，看行动。我们要用毛泽东思想指挥战斗！”
    喜讯传到车间，正在上夜班的工人们欢喜若狂；喜讯传到宿舍，正在吃饭的职工马上撂下饭碗；正在处理家务的女工立即丢下家务事。人们疾步如飞，怀着对伟大领袖毛主席的无限忠心，从四面八方来到工厂车间。人人都把完成这一艰巨的任务看作最大的幸福、最大的光荣！
    各个车间沸腾起来了。工人们正在批判中国赫鲁晓夫及其在厂内的代理人长期抵制、反对印制毛主席著作和毛主席画像的滔天罪行。工人们越批，对中国赫鲁晓夫越仇恨，对伟大领袖毛主席越热爱，从而迸发出无穷的力量。他们纷纷表示决心：用毛泽东思想武装起来的印刷工人就是宣传毛泽东思想的战士。为了让《毛主席去安源》的光辉形象及时地送到全国人民手中，我们坚决排除万难，大胆使用新技术，印制毛主席彩色画像，向毛主席表忠心！
    顷刻间，全厂一片欢腾。决心书、喜报挂满车间。工人们提出了响彻云霄的战斗口号：我们要以
    最高最高的政治热情
    最大最大的革命干劲
    最好最好的质量
    最快最快的速度
    最优异的成绩
    向党的四十七周年生日献礼
    向伟大领袖毛主席汇报！
    光辉节日前夕的北京新华印刷厂，到处是热烈的革命气氛。工人们满怀革命的豪情，投入了紧张的战斗！驻厂解放军支左人员，坚持用毛泽东思想挂帅，突出无产阶级政治。他们及时地把一条条毛主席语录送到车间，送到工人身边，并和工人们战斗在一起。
    照相制版的工人们投入了第一道工序的紧张劳动。这时，人们的心情特别激动，操作特别认真。因为照相制版这道工序，是整个印制过程的一个关键，他们深深地感到自己所担负的重任。
    修版工人聚精会神地坐在工作台旁，望着绘在玻璃版上的心中最红最红的红太阳的光辉形象，激动的心情久久不能平静：“毛主席啊，毛主席！您在一九二一年，为了中国人民的革命事业，亲自去安源，点燃了熊熊的革命烈火，为我们工人阶级的解放斗争开辟了胜利的航道。而大叛徒、大工贼中国赫鲁晓夫竟恬不知耻地贪天之功，妄想篡改历史，掩盖他老反革命的真面目。这一千个办不到！一万个办不到！”
    心潮澎湃的修版工人，这时感到自己肩上有千斤重担。他们觉得，自己手里的笔已经不再是一枝普通修版的笔了。他们用这枝笔，把我们伟大领袖毛主席在画面上的光辉形象描绘得更加逼真，把气势磅礴的背景描绘得更加雄伟、壮丽。他们用这枝笔，表达对毛主席的无限信仰，无限热爱，无限崇拜。笔笔划划表忠心，一秒一分献红心。
    工人们深深地懂得，在印制我们伟大领袖光辉形象时一定要精益求精。同时，为了使全国人民能早日看到《毛主席去安源》这幅油画，他们必须打破常规，找出最快最快的速度来。
    在平印车间有两台拷贝机，过去两台同时作业，几乎是不可想象的。以前，拷贝一套版需要两个小时，而如果要拷贝现在使用的九套版，则要十二个小时，这么长的时间，对于目前这个紧急任务是绝对不允许的。“我们要用分秒必争的行动表达对伟大领袖毛主席的热爱！”工人们经过研究，开动了两台拷贝机，同时操作，只用四个半小时就创造了这个车间用最快的速度当天制版、当天出成品的奇迹。
    照制工序遇到了一个难关：由于空气潮湿，底版放在风箱里不能很快烘干。怎么办？工人同志们谁都不愿意使这一庄严的印制任务在自己手里耽误一秒钟。于是他们拿来了电扇，用手举起，把底版吹干。
    印制车间的工人同志们，早在制版工序紧张进行的时刻，就做好了一系列周密细致的准备工作。时间已是深夜，他们一个个心情激动地围在摆成长蛇阵似的印刷机旁。此时此刻，他们感到格外的幸福。在文化大革命以前，由于中国赫鲁晓夫及其在新华印刷厂的代理人的阻挠，大部分机器不能用来印制我们伟大领袖毛主席的像。因此，十几年来，许许多多老工人日夜盼望有一天能够印制我们伟大领袖毛主席的彩色画像。现在这个幸福的时刻终于来到了，他们含着热泪激动地说：“没有伟大领袖毛主席就没有我们工人阶级的今天。中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人最害怕我们印制毛主席的光辉形象，今天我们要用最好的质量、最快的速度印制《毛主席去安源》油画，狠狠地给中国赫鲁晓夫一记响亮的耳光！”他们打破过去的旧框框，创造了多台机器“流水作业”套色的方法。
    凹印车间的工人们正在紧张地维修两台快速轮转机，使它为印制《毛主席去安源》油画贡献力量。这两台机器，由于过去党内一小撮走资派的阻挠和破坏，已经停用十年，有的部件已经生了锈。在无产阶级革命派掌权后的今天，它回到了工人手中，即将发挥巨大的作用。
    在全厂通力协作下，经过一段时间紧张的战斗，沉睡了十年的快速轮转机转动起来了。一颗颗红心啊，和着机器运转的节拍，在激烈地跳动。一双双眼睛啊，望着流水般涌出的“彩带”，闪烁着幸福的光芒。工人们双手捧着自己亲手印制出来的《毛主席去安源》彩色油画，庄严地端详着红太阳照亮了安源山。我们的伟大导师毛主席，英姿焕发，豪情满怀，风尘仆仆，大踏步地走来了！安源山在欢呼，萍水河在歌唱！安源的历史出现了伟大的转折，工人运动从此走上了正确的道路。看着这幅油画，工人们热血沸腾，激情满怀。毛主席啊，毛主席！您老人家的英明伟大，千歌万曲唱不完。看着这幅油画，工人们意气风发，斗志昂扬。毛主席啊，毛主席！您亲自掀起的安源的战斗风云，永远鼓舞着我们。今天，我们坚决紧跟您的伟大战略部署，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
    旭日东升，光芒万丈。伟大的、光荣的、正确的中国共产党四十七周年光辉生日来到了。北京新华印刷厂印出了大批《毛主席去安源》的油画。几乎是同一个时间，外文印刷厂、北京胶印厂、北京印刷四厂等十几家印刷厂也传来了印制《毛主席去安源》油画的胜利的喜报。
    我们印刷战线上的毛泽东思想宣传兵，在“毛主席万岁”的欢呼声中，在喧天锣鼓声中，向最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席，向毛主席亲手缔造的伟大的中国共产党，向党的光辉的四十七周年生日，献出了最最珍贵的礼品。　本报记者（附图片）
