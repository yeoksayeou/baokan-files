The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "Serve the people wholeheartedly, never part with the masses for a moment," and "Communist Party members must never separate themselves from the masses, never stand above the masses, and never become officials or lords." Reflecting on the past war years, we lived with the masses every day, sharing joys and sorrows, hardships and dangers, breathing the same air, and sharing the same fate. We had deep feelings for Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. However, after moving to the city, our status changed, the environment changed, our positions became more important, and our salaries increased. Our thoughts and emotions also gradually changed. Although I come from a poor peasant family and have experienced the bitter oppression of the old society, at this time, I began to seek comfort in my thoughts and started to live a special life. Thus, my connection with the masses became worse and worse. This Cultural Revolution of the proletariat has given me a profound education. Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and with the help of the revolutionary masses of the proletariat, I gradually realized my mistakes, went among the masses to deeply examine my soul, made a thorough self-criticism, and finally gained the understanding and trust of the revolutionary masses, being elected as the head of the county revolutionary committee.

After being elected as the head of the county revolutionary committee, I always remember Chairman Mao's teachings: "We must never leave the masses. Only then can we know the masses, understand the masses, and work with the masses, and only then can we serve the people well." I am determined to do the following: even if my position changes, I will not change my mindset of being a student of the masses; even if the environment changes, I will not change my style of closely connecting with the masses; even if the conditions change, I will not change my spirit of sharing joys and sorrows with the masses. In the past, when I went among the masses, I often unconsciously put on airs. Now, I actively help the poor and lower-middle peasants carry water, sweep the floor, and do household chores. The masses see that I have put down my airs, and they warmly call me "Old He." They dare to criticize me to my face, voluntarily talk to me about their thoughts, and report to me the situation of class struggle. This makes me deeply realize that: if cadres truly follow Chairman Mao's teachings, maintain and carry forward the Party's fine tradition of closely connecting with the masses, they can blend in with the masses, maintain the character of the working people, implement the working method of "from the masses, to the masses," and make fewer or no mistakes.

From my past experiences and lessons, I have realized that a special lifestyle will inevitably lead to separation from the masses. I have heightened my vigilance in this regard and strictly demanded of myself. My family of seven lives in one and a half rooms. Some comrades care about me and have offered to expand my living space several times, but I have declined. My wife and I have also agreed that the whole family will often eat bitter meals to educate ourselves and also educate our children, always remembering the bitterness of the old society and always remembering the happy life given to us by Chairman Mao.

I am determined to always maintain and carry forward the Party's fine tradition of closely connecting with the masses, and to make new contributions to the complete victory of the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat and to the consolidation and development of the new revolutionary committee.

    永远保持联系群众的优良作风
    浙江省长兴县革命委员会主任　贺修贤
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“全心全意地为人民服务，一刻也不脱离群众”、“共产党员绝不可脱离群众，绝不可高踞于群众之上，做官当老爷”。回想过去战争年代，我们天天和群众生活在一起，同甘苦，共患难，同呼吸，共命运，对毛主席的无产阶级革命路线有深厚的感情。可是，进城以后，地位变了，环境变了，“官”做大了，薪水多了，思想感情也逐渐起了变化。我虽然出身于苦大仇深的贫农家庭，从小给地主干活，饱尝过旧社会的阶级压迫。可是，这时候思想上讲究起享受来，生活上开始特殊化，这样，自己和群众的联系也就越来越差了。这次无产阶级文化大革命，给我的教育非常深刻。在毛主席无产阶级革命路线的指引下，在无产阶级革命派的帮助下，我逐步认识到自己的错误，到群众中去狠触灵魂，作深刻的检查，终于得到广大革命群众的谅解和信任，被推选为县革命委员会主任。
    我当选为县革委会主任以后，牢记毛主席的教导：“我们任何时候都不要离开群众。这样，我们就可能知道群众，了解群众，同群众一道，也就可能好好地为人民服务。”我下决心做到：地位变了，做群众小学生的思想不能变；环境变了，密切联系群众的作风不能变；条件变了，和群众同甘共苦的精神不能变。我过去到群众中去往往自觉不自觉地摆架子，现在我就主动去帮助贫下中农挑水、扫地、做家务事。群众看我放下了架子，亲热地叫我“老贺”，敢于当面给我提批评意见，主动和我谈心里话，向我反映阶级斗争的情况。这使我深深地体会到：当干部的切实按照毛主席的教导，保持和发扬党的紧密联系群众的优良作风，就能和群众打成一片，就能保持劳动人民的本色，就能实行“从群众中来，到群众中去”的工作方法，就能少犯或不犯错误。
    我从过去的经验教训中体会到，生活作风特殊化，必然会导致脱离群众。我在这方面提高了警惕，严格要求自己。我全家七口人，住一间半房子。有的同志关心我，几次要给我扩大住房，我都谢绝了。我和我的爱人还商定全家经常吃忆苦饭，教育自己，也教育子女，永远记住旧社会的苦，永远记住毛主席给的幸福生活。
    我决心永远保持和发扬党的紧密联系群众的优良作风，为夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利，为巩固和发展新生的革命委员会做出新的贡献。
