The Soviet revisionist clique, under the guise of "Sino-American cultural exchange," recently held a so-called "Soviet Fashion Design Exhibition" in Washington, which was highly praised and applauded by the American bosses.

According to reports from Western reporters, the exhibition showcased the "masterpieces" designed by the Soviet revisionists' top fashion experts. Among them were designs mimicking Western slim-legged pants and mini-skirts, such as the "Space Age" outfit and the "Revolutionary" outfit, and others that mixed tsarist-era aristocratic styles with modern Western bourgeois styles under the pretense of "Russian national style."

The exhibition's clear "Westernization" and "restoration" characteristics immediately caught the attention of the big bosses of American monopolies and various bourgeois representatives. They enthusiastically praised the Soviet revisionists' efforts to learn from the West in the field of fashion, saying it was "exciting." James Kennedy, the deputy manager of the American synthetic fiber company that hosted the exhibition, gleefully said, "Today's Soviet fashion reflects a strong restoration sentiment, a high sensitivity to the present era, and a full understanding and acceptance of international fashion trends." He expressed his intention to take this exhibition on a tour of various places in the United States.

The facts show that the Soviet revisionist clique has not only completely degenerated into a lackey of American imperialism in politics but has also fully accepted the "fashion" of the Western bourgeoisie in their entire way of life, even in their clothing. The traitors Brezhnev, Kosygin, and their ilk have rotted to the core, from their souls to their bodies.

    苏修在华盛顿搞西方化“时装”展览
    美国主子拍手喝采大叫“令人振奋”
    新华社十六日讯　华盛顿消息：苏修叛徒集团打着“苏美文化交流”的幌子，不久前在华盛顿举办了一个所谓“苏联时装设计展览会”，博得了美国主子的赞赏和喝采。
    据西方记者报道，展览会上展出了苏修“顶呱呱的现代服装专家”所设计的“杰作”。其中有的是被称为“苏联最著名先锋派服装设计专家”模仿西方的瘦腿裤和超短裙而设计的什么“宇宙世纪”装、“革新”装等等，有的是在“俄罗斯民族式”的幌子下搞的沙皇时代贵族式样和现代西方资产阶级式样的混杂物。
    这次展览会所表现的鲜明的“西方化”和“复旧”的特点，马上引起了美国垄断集团大老板和形形色色资产阶级代表人物的重视。他们纷纷为苏修在时装方面也不遗余力学习西方的精神拍手叫好说，这是“令人振奋”的。主持这次展出的美国人造纤维公司的副经理詹姆斯·肯尼迪兴高采烈地说：“今天的苏联时装的总貌反映出强烈的复旧情绪、对现时代的高度敏感以及对国际时装新趋向的充分理解和全盘接受”。他表示还准备把这个展览拿到美国各地去巡回展览。
    种种事实表明，今天苏修叛徒集团不仅在政治上完全堕落为美帝国主义的奴仆，而且整个生活方式，甚至衣着上也全盘接受西方资产阶级的“时髦”，勃列日涅夫、柯西金这一伙叛徒们从灵魂到躯壳都已腐烂透顶。
