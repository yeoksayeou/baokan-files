July 1st of this year was a day we will never forget, the happiest day of our lives. Our dearest Red Sun, Chairman Mao, and his close comrade-in-arms, Deputy Chairman Lin Biao, watched and listened to our performance of the piano-accompanied "The Red Lantern," and warmly received all of us who participated in the performance. This is the greatest care, support, encouragement, and spur that Chairman Mao has given us! We have a thousand words and a thousand songs, but we cannot express the excitement in our hearts. We joyfully shout: "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand times ten thousand years!" "Wishing Chairman Mao eternal life! Ten thousand times ten thousand years!"

The piano-accompanied "The Red Lantern" is a beautiful flower in the garden of proletarian literature and art. It was born under the guidance of Chairman Mao's revolutionary literary and artistic line, personally cultivated by Comrade Jiang Qing, and emerged in the great situation of the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Its birth is a great victory for Chairman Mao's revolutionary literary and artistic line!

Great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "Our literature and art should 'learn from the West to serve China, innovate and push forward,' and serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers." Following Chairman Mao's brilliant thoughts, Comrade Jiang Qing took the task of creating lofty images of workers, peasants, and soldiers as the central task of socialist revolutionary literature and art. Comrade Jiang Qing led us in the revolution of Peking Opera, breaking through the anti-revolutionary revisionist literary and artistic black line with China's Khrushchev as the main culprit, capturing the most ancient and stubborn fortress of Peking Opera, creating revolutionary model operas such as "The Red Lantern," and shaping the brilliant images of revolutionary heroes like Li Yuhe and Li Tie Mei. This is the beginning of a new era in the world's proletarian revolutionary literature and art! Comrade Jiang Qing is a bold and innovative proletarian revolutionary. As early as 1964, Comrade Jiang Qing instructed that the piano should be used for revolutionary modern Peking Opera accompaniment. However, this important instruction was blocked by a handful of anti-revolutionary revisionists in the literary and artistic circles and could not be shared with revolutionary literary and artists. The great proletarian cultural revolution exposed these class enemies, and their sabotage plots were thoroughly foiled. Under Comrade Jiang Qing's leadership, after half a year of repeated practice, we finally made the Western instrument, the piano, adapt to the needs of revolutionary modern Peking Opera in shaping the images of workers, peasants, and soldiers, and successfully created the piano-accompanied "The Red Lantern."

Following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, firmly carrying out Comrade Jiang Qing's instructions is the key to the quick success of the piano-accompanied "The Red Lantern." We deeply felt this in our practice.

In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we proletarian revolutionaries seized power from the capitalist roaders, established revolutionary committees with three-in-one combinations, smashed the blockade and sabotage of the anti-revolutionary revisionist literary and artistic black line, and ensured that the instructions from the proletarian headquarters could be quickly conveyed to us revolutionary literary and artists and implemented without any compromise. This is another key to the quick success of the piano-accompanied "The Red Lantern."

In our repeated experiments with accompaniment, we received strong support from the revolutionary masses. Every time we rehearsed, many people came to listen quietly, and even passersby outside the door couldn't help but stop to listen. After listening to a piece, they would enthusiastically offer many valuable suggestions, helping us to explore, analyze, and improve. It is this collective wisdom and broad mass base that promoted the quick and smooth birth of the piano-accompanied "The Red Lantern." If it were just a few of us experimenting in a small circle, it is obvious that we would not be able to implement Comrade Jiang Qing's instructions better.

The piano, this Western instrument, was previously used in both foreign countries and China to serve the feudal class and the bourgeoisie's lords, ladies, young masters, and young misses. The music played was all decadent tunes, completely incompatible with the thoughts and feelings of the working people. Comrade Jiang Qing, with the great vision of a proletarian revolutionary, instructed that the piano should be used for the accompaniment of China's revolutionary modern Peking Opera and to serve proletarian politics. Practice has proven that using the piano for accompaniment can often make full use of its wide range, magnificent momentum, and rich expressiveness in the setting, description, embellishment, and enhancement of music, better expressing the revolutionary heroes' strong fighting passion, lofty spiritual realm, and firm confidence in victory. It is beneficial to express the revolutionary atmosphere of our times and to shape the great images of workers, peasants, and soldiers.

For example, in the segment "Remembering the Red Lantern," when Li Tie Mei sings "Uncle is willing to shed blood and sacrifice, but why?" there is a drawn-out note. At this moment, the piano uses a light and lively tune to describe the innocent Li Tie Mei's thought process. Suddenly, there is a pause, and then it transitions into a powerful and forceful melody, expressing that Li Tie Mei has found the correct answer. Below, Li Tie Mei sings: "It is to save China and the poor, to defeat the enemy soldiers." This segment of piano accompaniment describes Li Tie Mei's thought process in a very delicate and profound way, making the audience feel particularly close, much better than the original effect.

Another example is Li Yuhe's singing of "Ambition Soars to the Sky" in "Struggle on the Execution Ground." Originally, it was a complete set of singing tunes. When creating the piano accompaniment, we conducted key experiments. At the beginning, we added a prelude, using the piano's magnificent and unrestrained melody to describe Li Yuhe's unyielding struggle against the enemy, heroic and indomitable revolutionary spirit, and revolutionary optimism. It vividly depicts the scene of Li Yuhe, shackled and limping, walking out of the prison from far to near. In the audience's mind, the tall figure of Li Yuhe is formed. The actor is also carried into the role by this melody, cultivating a full emotional state. When the actor sings "The jailer's howl like a wolf, stepping out of the prison," Li Yuhe's lofty spiritual realm is immediately understood by the audience. At this moment, the emotions on stage and off stage blend together, creating a very good effect. When the actor sings "To the execution ground, head held high, looking far ahead," the piano, based on our previous transitions, adds a large segment of piano solo, fully expressing Li Yuhe's revolutionary passion while in prison, looking at the world. He stands tall and looks far, seeing the anti-Japanese flames burning everywhere under Chairman Mao's leadership, seeing the revolutionary waves surging higher and higher, seeing the great scene of revolutionary victory and joyous celebration of the masses. This large segment of solo gives the audience a very strong impression, making them feel as if they have seen everything Li Yuhe sees. When the actor sings again "I see the red flag of revolution raised high, the anti-Japanese flames have spread, enemy, see how long you can rule tyrannically," Li Yuhe's heroic image stands even taller and more perfectly in front of the audience. After this set of singing tunes, the piano still has a concluding segment, fully expressing Li Yuhe's passion, with an effect of lingering melody and deep thought. Such piano accompaniment, starting with a prelude, enhancing in the middle, and ending with revolutionary lyricism, makes this complete set of singing tunes particularly perfect and moving. There are many similar examples, but I will not list them one by one.

The piano-accompanied "The Red Lantern," created according to Comrade Jiang Qing's instructions, not only retains the basic characteristics and unique national form and style of Peking Opera singing, but also fully utilizes the unique expressiveness of the piano, achieving a perfect combination of Western piano art and Chinese Peking Opera art. Therefore, the piano accompaniment of revolutionary modern Peking Opera was immediately understood and warmly welcomed by the workers, peasants, and soldiers. Recently, we have received many letters from the workers, peasants, and soldiers, saying: "Listening to such new revolutionary music is like attending a lively political class. The piano-accompanied 'The Red Lantern' enthusiastically praises Mao Zedong Thought and praises the heroic figures of workers, peasants, and soldiers. We not only love such revolutionary art from the bottom of our hearts but also firmly support and defend such revolutionary art." The workers, peasants, and soldiers enthusiastically praise and welcome the new varieties of proletarian revolutionary literature and art, which is a great encouragement and support for revolutionary literary and artists, making us more confident.

The success of the piano-accompanied "The Red Lantern" is a new victory for Chairman Mao's revolutionary literary and artistic line. It has opened up a new path for Western instruments and symphonies and a new path for the accompaniment of our great motherland's drama. This is another outstanding contribution by Comrade Jiang Qing in establishing the new proletarian and the different socialist. It fully demonstrates the strong vitality of proletarian revolutionary new literature and art and once again shows the invincible power of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary literary and artistic line!

We live in the great era of Mao Zedong, creating art under the personal leadership of Comrade Jiang Qing, feeling extremely proud and happy! With the invincible Mao Zedong Thought guiding our direction, and with Comrade Jiang Qing, a proletarian revolutionary who deeply understands and actively applies the great Mao Zedong Thought, leading us revolutionary literary and artists, we will hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, walk the path that no one has ever walked, and climb the peaks that no one has ever climbed, moving from victory to victory, striving to create the unprecedented and brilliant proletarian revolutionary literature and art in human history. This is how glorious and happy it is! We are willing to dedicate everything we have to this incredibly magnificent cause!

Of course, our personal ideological and artistic levels are still far from Chairman Mao's teachings and Comrade Jiang Qing's requirements. Our work has just begun. In the future, we will definitely redouble our efforts to study and apply Mao Zedong Thought, learn from the workers, peasants, and soldiers, thoroughly reform ourselves, and become true proletarian revolutionary literary and artists. We will closely follow our great leader Chairman Mao and, under Comrade Jiang Qing's leadership, advance along Chairman Mao's revolutionary literary and artistic line, striving to make new contributions to the development of our country's proletarian revolutionary new literature and art and fighting for the defense of Chairman Mao's revolutionary literary and artistic line for life.

    为创造光辉灿烂的无产阶级新文艺而奋斗
    中国京剧团　钱浩梁　刘长瑜
    今年七月一日，是我们终生难忘的最幸福的一天。我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席和他的亲密战友林彪副主席，观看和聆听了我们演出的钢琴伴唱《红灯记》，并且亲切地接见了我们全体参加演出的革命文艺战士，这是伟大领袖毛主席对我们最大的关怀，最大的支持，最大的鼓舞，最大的鞭策！我们千言万语，千歌万曲，也表达不尽内心的激动。我们纵情欢呼：“毛主席万岁！万万岁！”“敬祝毛主席万寿无疆！万寿无疆！”
    钢琴伴唱《红灯记》，是无产阶级文艺园地中的一朵鲜花。它是在毛主席革命文艺路线指引下，由江青同志亲自培育，在无产阶级文化大革命夺取全面胜利的大好形势下诞生的。它的诞生是毛主席革命文艺路线的伟大胜利！
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：我们的文学艺术要“洋为中用、推陈出新”，为工农兵服务。按照毛主席的光辉思想，江青同志把塑造高大的工农兵英雄形象作为社会主义革命文艺的中心任务。江青同志率领我们进行京剧革命，冲破了以中国赫鲁晓夫为总后台的反革命修正主义文艺黑线，攻克了京剧这个最古老、最顽固的堡垒，创作了《红灯记》等革命样板戏，塑造了李玉和、李铁梅等革命英雄的光辉形象。这是世界无产阶级革命文艺的划时代的开端！江青同志是一位勇于创造，不断前进的无产阶级革命家。早在一九六四年，江青同志就指示钢琴要为革命现代京剧伴唱。但是，这个重要指示却被盘踞在文艺界的一小撮反革命修正主义分子横加封锁，迟迟不能和革命文艺战士见面。轰轰烈烈的无产阶级文化大革命，把这一小撮阶级敌人揪出来了，他们的破坏阴谋彻底破产。江青同志领导我们经过半年时间的反复实践，终于使钢琴这个西洋乐器适应了革命现代京剧塑造工农兵英雄形象的需要，成功地创作了钢琴伴唱《红灯记》。
    紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，坚决按照江青同志的指示去做，这就是钢琴伴唱《红灯记》所以很快获得成功的主要关键。我们在实践中深深体会到了这一条。
    在无产阶级文化大革命中，我们无产阶级革命派夺了走资派的权，成立了三结合的革命委员会，粉碎了反革命修正主义文艺黑线的封锁和破坏，使无产阶级司令部的指示，能够迅速地和我们革命文艺战士见面，不折不扣地得到贯彻，这是钢琴伴唱《红灯记》很快获得成功的又一关键。
    在我们反复试验伴唱中，得到了革命群众的大力支持。每次试唱都有不少人跑来静听，连门外过路的同志也忍不住站下来静听。听完一曲，他们总要热情地提出许多有益意见，帮助我们探索、分析、改进。正是这种集思广益、发挥集体智慧的群众基础，促使钢琴伴唱《红灯记》迅速地顺利地诞生出来。如果只是我们几个人在小圈子里搞试验，很明显我们就不可能把江青同志的指示贯彻得更好。
    钢琴这种西洋乐器，过去无论是在外国还是在中国，都是拿来为封建阶级和资产阶级的老爷太太少爷小姐服务的。弹奏出来的尽是靡靡之音，和劳动人民的思想感情格格不入。江青同志以无产阶级革命家的宏大气魄，指示要把钢琴拿来为中国的革命现代京剧伴唱，为无产阶级政治服务。实践证明：用钢琴伴唱，在音乐的铺叙、描写、渲染、烘托上，常常能发挥它的音域宽广、气势雄伟、富有表现力的特长，更好地表现革命英雄强烈的战斗激情、崇高的思想境界和坚定的胜利信心，有利于表现我们时代的革命气氛，有利于塑造伟大的工农兵英雄形象。
    比如李铁梅在《忆红灯》一段唱到“表叔甘愿流血牺牲，他们到底为什么”的地方有个拖腔，这时候钢琴用轻灵活泼的调子描写天真的小铁梅的思索过程，忽然有个停顿，再转入雄浑有力的旋律，表现铁梅已经得到正确的答案。底下铁梅就唱：“为的是救中国救穷人，打败鬼子兵”，这一段钢琴伴唱，把铁梅的思想活动描写得很细腻很深刻，使观众感到特别亲切，比原来的效果好得多了。
    又如李玉和在《刑场斗争》中唱的《雄心壮志冲云天》这一段，本来是完整的成套的唱腔，在创作钢琴伴唱的时候，我们作了重点试验。头里加了前奏曲，利用钢琴雄壮奔放的旋律，描写李玉和与敌人顽强斗争、英勇不屈的革命英雄气概和革命乐观主义精神，形象地表现了李玉和受刑后锁着脚镣一步一步由远而近迈步出监的情景，在观众的心目中形成了李玉和的高大形象。而演员也被这旋律带进了角色，酝酿了饱满的情绪。当演员唱到“狱警传似狼嚎迈步出监”时，李玉和崇高的精神境界就立刻被观众理解了。这时台上台下的情绪交融在一起，效果非常好。当演员唱到“赴刑场、气昂昂抬头远看”的地方，钢琴在我们从前的过门的基础上加以发挥，成为一大段钢琴独奏，淋漓尽致地抒写了李玉和身在监牢、放眼世界的革命豪情。他站得很高，看得很远，看到了在毛主席领导之下抗日烽火遍地燃烧，看到了革命浪潮一浪高过一浪，看到了革命胜利万众欢腾的伟大场面。这一大段独奏给观众非常强烈的感受，使观众仿佛看到了李玉和眼中所看到的这一切。当演员再唱到“我看到革命的红旗高举起，抗日的烽火已燎原，日寇，看你横行霸道能有几天”时，李玉和的英雄形象就更高大更完美地岿然屹立在观众面前。这套唱腔唱完以后，钢琴还有一段结束曲，把李玉和的豪情尽量抒发，有余音不尽、耐人寻味的效果。这样的钢琴伴唱，开头用铺垫，中间用烘托，末尾用革命的抒情，就使这段完整成套的唱腔显得特别完美特别动人了。类似的例子还很多，就不一一列举了。
    根据江青同志的指示创作成功的钢琴伴唱《红灯记》，既保持了京剧唱腔的基本特点和它独特的民族形式民族风格，又充分发挥了钢琴所特有的表现力，达到了西洋钢琴艺术和中国京剧艺术的完美结合。因此，钢琴伴唱革命现代京剧立刻就被工农兵群众理解，受到热烈的欢迎。近来我们收到很多工农兵群众的来信，他们说：“听了这样崭新的革命音乐，等于给我们上了一堂生动的政治课。钢琴伴唱《红灯记》，热情地歌颂毛泽东思想、歌颂工农兵英雄人物，我们不但从心里喜爱这样的革命艺术，而且坚决支持和保卫这样的革命艺术。”工农兵群众这样热情地赞赏和欢迎无产阶级革命文艺的新品种，这是对革命文艺战士极大的鼓舞和支持，使我们的信心更足了。
    钢琴伴唱《红灯记》创作成功，是毛主席革命文艺路线的新胜利，它为西洋乐器、交响乐开辟了一条新的道路，为我们伟大祖国的戏剧伴奏开辟了一条新的道路。这是江青同志标无产阶级之新，立社会主义之异的又一个卓越贡献。它充分表现了无产阶级革命新文艺的强大生命力，又一次显示了毛主席无产阶级革命文艺路线的无比威力！
    我们生活在伟大的毛泽东时代，在江青同志亲自领导下从事艺术创作，深深感到无比的自豪，无比的幸福！有战无不胜的毛泽东思想，指引着我们前进的方向，有江青同志这样一位对伟大的毛泽东思想领会很深、用得很活的无产阶级革命家率领我们革命文艺战士，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，走前人从未走过的道路，攀登前人从未攀过的高峰，从胜利走向胜利，为创造人类历史上旷古未有、灿烂辉煌的无产阶级革命文艺而奋斗，这是多么的光荣！多么的幸福！我们愿意为这无比壮丽的事业献出自己的一切！
    当然，我们个人的思想水平和艺术水平距离毛主席的教导，距离江青同志的要求还很远很远，我们的工作还刚刚开始。我们今后一定加倍努力活学活用毛泽东思想，向工农兵学习，彻底改造自己，使自己成为真正的无产阶级革命文艺战士，紧跟我们伟大领袖毛主席，在江青同志的率领下，沿着毛主席的革命文艺路线奋勇前进，为发展我国无产阶级革命新文艺立新功，为捍卫毛主席的革命文艺路线奋斗终生。
