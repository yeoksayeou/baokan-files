	"Colleges and universities are still needed, but mainly those for science and engineering. The school system should be shortened, education should be revolutionized, and political and ideological work in education must be in command. Follow the Shanghai Machine Tool Factory's approach of training technicians from among the workers. Select students from among workers and peasants with practical experience, have them study in school for a few years, and then return to production practice."

	Chairman Mao's latest important instructions have struck a chord in our hearts. Chairman Mao's great instructions are not only the battle program for the education revolution but also the compass for our factory's struggle, criticism, and reform. They are the century-long strategy for our country to prevent and guard against revisionism.

	We, the engineering and technical personnel sent to the factory by colleges and universities after liberation, have deeply felt in practice that "staying in the office to pursue technology is a dead end; combining with the worker masses opens up a bright future."

	Under the control of the counter-revolutionary revisionist clique of the former Beijing Municipal Committee, our Beijing Instrument Factory had a complicated technical team. The technical leadership was in the hands of bourgeois intellectuals. Technical cadres were aloof, detached from proletarian politics, detached from the worker masses, and detached from production practice. They spent all day in the office poring over books and designing products in isolation. They did not pursue how to combine with the worker and peasant masses to reform their thinking but instead aimed to align with so-called technical "authorities," master a few foreign languages, design a few products, and build monuments for themselves. The relationship between technical personnel and workers was not harmonious. When there were problems in the workshop, workers would call the office to ask for technical assistance. The technicians would then go to the workshop with an air of superiority to "solve the problem." If the problem could not be solved, they would consult the books instead of discussing with the worker comrades. As a result, many problems could not be solved in time, seriously affecting the completion of production tasks. For example, in 1965, a 10-ton "universal material testing machine" was produced, but the "creep" and "return" did not meet the requirements. The technical personnel spent months poring over books and consulting materials but did not consult the workers, and it took several months to adjust it.

	During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we criticized the counter-revolutionary revisionist technological line pushed by Khrushchev in China, criticized Khrushchev's "expert-led factory" and "production first" revisionist fallacies, and greatly improved the thinking of the broad technical cadres. We decided to follow the path of combining with the worker and peasant masses as indicated by Chairman Mao.

	Under the great call of Chairman Mao to "streamline administration and reduce personnel," the broad technical cadres in our factory walked out of the "technical building" and went to the production front line, participated in production labor, and combined with the worker masses. In a short time, they created unexpected miracles.

	At the end of May, our factory proposed to complete the assembly and debugging of three "300 single crystal furnaces" in June. At that time, many technical personnel thought this was impossible. In the past, it took three months to complete the assembly and debugging of one machine. Now, the mechanical part had not been assembled, so how could the assembly and debugging of three machines be completed in one month? Someone said, "Abandon conservative thinking, and completing one machine in a month would be very good." However, the revolutionary committee of the factory used Mao Zedong Thought to command the battle, insisting on the "two participations, one reform, and three combinations" approach. As a result, the entire task was completed in just 27 days, and the debugging took only three and a half days, with better quality than before.

	In this battle, we indeed tasted the sweetness of combining with the workers. Not only were many major technical problems solved in time, but the worker comrades' serious and responsible attitude of cherishing state property also deeply educated us.

	The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has created conditions for the leap in production, and the combination of engineering and technical personnel with the worker masses has opened up a broad road for production. Now, the technical innovation activities in the entire factory are booming, and the output value has increased significantly. From January to June this year compared with the same period in 1966, it increased by 64.4%.

	Under the guidance of the latest instructions of our great leader Chairman Mao, we will advance with firm steps along the road of combining with the workers, peasants, and soldiers. Forward!

    与工人相结合就能创造奇迹
    北京仪器厂工程技术人员　李永安　杨开春　李万玲　李毅华　陈孟慧
      “大学还是要办的，我这里主要说的是理工科大学还要办，但学制要缩短，教育要革命，要无产阶级政治挂帅，走上海机床厂从工人中培养技术人员的道路。要从有实践经验的工人农民中间选拔学生，到学校学几年以后，又回到生产实践中去。”毛主席这一极为重要的最新指示，句句字字说到了我们心坎里。毛主席这一伟大指示，不仅是教育革命的战斗纲领，而且是我们工厂斗、批、改的方向盘，是我们国家反修防修的百年大计。
    我们这些解放后由大专院校输送进厂的工程技术人员，从实践中深深体会到：“闭门钻技术，死路一条；与工人群众相结合，光明大道。”
    我们北京仪器厂在旧北京市委反革命修正主义集团把持下，搞了一个庞杂的技术队伍。厂里的技术领导权，为资产阶级知识分子所把持。技术干部高高在上，脱离无产阶级政治，脱离工人群众，脱离生产实践。整天坐在办公室死扣书本，闭门造车。大家追求的不是如何与工农群众结合，改造思想，而是向所谓的技术“权威”看齐，掌握几门外文，设计几个产品，为自己树碑立传。技术人员和工人之间，关系不融洽。车间加工有问题，工人打电话到楼上请技术员，技术员以高人一等的姿态到车间“解决问题”。问题解决不了，就向书本请教，不同工人同志商量。结果，许多问题不能及时解决，严重影响了生产任务的完成。例如，一九六五年制出了一台十吨“万能材料试验机”，“爬行”及“回程”达不到要求，技术人员死钻书本找资料，不向工人请教，搞了好几个月也调试不出来。
    在无产阶级文化大革命中，我们批判了中国赫鲁晓夫推行的反革命修正主义技术路线，批判了中国赫鲁晓夫的“专家治厂”、“生产第一”等修正主义谬论，广大技术干部思想有很大提高，决心走毛主席为我们指出的同工农群众相结合的道路。
    在毛主席“精兵简政”的伟大号召的指引下，我厂广大技术干部走出“技术楼”，走上生产第一线，参加生产劳动，与工人群众相结合。时间不长，就创造了意想不到的奇迹。
    五月底，我厂提出在六月份要完成三台“三百单晶炉”的总装配和调试工作。当时，很多技术人员认为这是不可能的事。过去，总装完毕，总调试一台就需要花三个月的时间，现在机械部分还没有装配，一个月内怎么能完成三台的总装配和调试工作呢？有人说：“去掉保守思想，一个月完成一台也就很不错了。”但是，厂革命委员会用毛泽东思想指挥大家作战，坚持走“两参一改三结合”的道路。结果，仅用二十七天就完成了全部任务，调试一项只用了三天半的时间，质量比过去还好。
    在这场战斗中，我们确实尝到了同工人相结合的甜头。不仅许多重大技术问题得到及时解决，工人同志们认真负责、爱护国家财产的主人翁态度，也使我们受到了深刻的教育。
    无产阶级文化大革命给生产的飞跃发展创造了条件，工程技术人员和工人群众相结合，为生产开辟了宽广的道路。现在，全厂的技术革新活动蓬勃开展，产值大幅度增长。今年一至六月份与一九六六年同期相比，增长百分之六十四点四。
    在伟大领袖毛主席的最新指示指引下，我们要以坚定的步伐，沿着同工农兵相结合的道路前进，前进！
