Our Battlefield is in the Countryside

	The vast countryside offers great opportunities for us to make a difference. This is the experience of the knowledge youth who returned to Guangkuo Tian Di Da You Zuo Public Commune in Xiong County, Henan Province.

In "The Socialist Upsurge in China's Countryside," edited by our great leader Chairman Mao, there is an article titled "Experience in Planning Cooperativization in a Township." This township is our Guangkuo Tian Di Public Commune, originally known as Dali Zhuang Township. In the commentary on this article, Chairman Mao points out: "All such intellectuals who can go to the countryside to work should gladly go there. The countryside is a vast expanse where one can achieve great things." Chairman Mao has shown us intellectual youth the revolutionary path of integrating with the workers and peasants.

	However, the Chinese Khrushchev, in order to restore capitalism, vehemently opposed Chairman Mao's great instructions. In 1957, he came to our Xuchang region and relentlessly instilled bourgeois individualism into us young intellectuals. He blathered on about:

	"In the countryside, don't bother with anything, don't do anything. Seriously farm for three to five years, ... meet three conditions (be proficient in farming, be educated, have good relationships with the people), and the people will elect you as a township, county, or provincial cadre, and you can also go to the central government." The Chinese Khrushchev designed for us young intellectuals a "down-to-the-countryside-to-become-an-official" map.

	After going to the countryside, should we settle down and work with the poor and lower-middle peasants to build a new socialist countryside for life, or should we treat going to the countryside as a personal stepping stone to "fame and fortune," "promotion and wealth"? This is a fundamental contradiction between two worldviews and a touchstone to test whether a young intellectual is a true revolutionary or a false one.

	In 1958, with a heart full of boundless love for Chairman Mao, I returned to my hometown. As soon as I arrived in the countryside, I eagerly joined the vigorous three great revolutionary movements to undergo tempering and testing. The poor and lower-middle peasants, seeing me return to the countryside, unanimously elected me to take over the accounting work. Should I do it or not? I engaged in a fierce struggle within myself. I thought, I am the son of a poor peasant, and it is the Party and Chairman Mao who saved me from the depths of misery and nurtured me. Now that the revolution needs me, and the poor and lower-middle peasants demand it of me, I should resolutely do it, actively do it, and do it to the end! Thus, I firmly took hold of the financial power of the poor and lower-middle peasants. I always remember Chairman Mao's teaching: "We Communists are not seeking official positions, but are seeking revolution." I regard the countryside as a revolutionary crucible for tempering and growing young intellectuals. During the day, I study and apply Chairman Mao's works with the poor and lower-middle peasants, work in the fields with them, and conduct scientific experiments with them. At night, after settling all kinds of accounts, I consult Chairman Mao's works about the problems I encountered during the day, eliminate selfishness and establish public-mindedness, and strive to use Mao Zedong Thought to guide all my words and deeds. I took the first step on the road to ideological revolution.

	During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, I regarded the countryside as the frontline for defending Chairman Mao, defending Mao Zedong Thought, and defending Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. As soon as the movement began, I closely united with the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and launched a fierce attack on the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in this region. At that time, a handful of capitalist roaders within the old county committee repeatedly invited me to the county seat, using the method of promising official positions to win me over to "protect" them in the county seat. I loudly rebuked them: "Put away your tricks! I want revolution, not to be an official! My battlefield is in the vast expanse, not in the county committee courtyard!" At the critical moment of the fierce struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines, I always fought side by side with the poor and lower-middle peasants, launching a fierce attack on the class enemy, defending Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and raising my awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants elected me as a member of the provincial poor peasants' representative congress, a member, standing committee member, and vice-chairman of the revolutionary committees at the prefecture, county, and commune levels. This is the Party and the poor and lower-middle peasants' greatest trust and greatest encouragement to me.

	The vast countryside is a great school for nurturing successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause. The hundreds of young intellectuals in our commune are striding forward along the revolutionary path indicated by Chairman Mao. In the future, we will hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, thoroughly criticize the crimes of the Chinese Khrushchev in the field of young intellectuals going up to the mountains and down to the countryside, and with our own fighting practices, paint the newest and most beautiful picture of China's socialist countryside, and write a new chapter of young intellectuals' struggle in the vast expanse!

    我们的战斗岗位在农村
    河南省郏县广阔天地大有作为公社回乡知识青年　卢中央
    伟大领袖毛主席亲自编选的《中国农村的社会主义高潮》中，有一篇《在一个乡里进行合作化规划的经验》。这个乡就是我们广阔天地公社，原来叫大李庄乡。毛主席在这篇文章的按语中指出：“一切可以到农村中去工作的这样的知识分子，应当高兴地到那里去。农村是一个广阔的天地，在那里是可以大有作为的。”毛主席给我们知识青年指出了同工农群众相结合的革命道路。
    但是，中国赫鲁晓夫为了复辟资本主义，极力反对毛主席的伟大指示。一九五七年他来到我们许昌地区，拚命地向我们知识青年灌输资产阶级利己主义的毒素。他胡说什么：
  “到农村什么也不要管，什么也不要干。认真地种三、五年地，……具备三条（种田样样都会、有文化、群众关系好），群众就会选你当乡、县、省干部，也可以到中央。”中国赫鲁晓夫为我们知识青年设计的，是一幅
  “下乡升官图”。
    到农村后，是扎下根来，同贫下中农一起为建设社会主义新农村干一辈子，还是把下乡劳动当作个人“成名成家”、“升官发财”的阶梯？这是两种根本对立的世界观，也是检验一个知识青年是真革命还是假革命的试金石。
    一九五八年，我怀着一颗无限热爱毛主席的红心，回到了我的家乡。一到农村，我就积极投入轰轰烈烈的三大革命运动中接受锻炼和考验。贫下中农见我回农村，一致推选我接任会计工作。干不干？我进行了激烈的思想斗争。我想，我是个贫农的儿子，是党和毛主席把我从水深火热之中救出来并培养长大的，现在革命需要我干，贫下中农要求我干，我就应该坚决地干，积极地干，干到底！于是，我毅然决然地把贫下中农的财权牢牢地掌起来了。我牢记毛主席“我们共产党人不是要做官，而是要革命”的教导，把农村当作我们知识青年锻炼成长的革命大熔炉。白天，我同贫下中农一起活学活用毛主席著作，一起下田劳动，一起搞科学实验。晚上，我把各种账目结算清了以后，带着一天中遇到的问题，向毛主席著作请教，破私立公，努力运用毛泽东思想指导自己的一切言行。我在思想革命化的道路上迈出了第一步。
    在无产阶级文化大革命中，我把农村当作保卫毛主席、保卫毛泽东思想、保卫毛主席革命路线的前沿阵地。运动一开始，我就紧紧地同广大贫下中农团结在一起，大造了中国赫鲁晓夫和他在本地区代理人的反。当时，旧县委内一小撮走资派多次请我到县城，用封官许愿的办法，拉拢我在县城里“保”他们。我大声怒斥他们：“收起你们的鬼把戏吧！我要的是革命，不是做官！我的战斗岗位在广阔天地，不在县委大院！”在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线激烈搏斗的关键时刻，我都同贫下中农并肩战斗，向阶级敌人展开猛烈的进攻，捍卫了毛主席的革命路线，并提高了自己的阶级斗争和两条路线斗争的觉悟。广大贫下中农把我选为省贫代会委员，地、县、社革委会委员、常委、副主任。这是党和贫下中农对我的最大信任、最大鞭策。
    农村这个广阔的天地，是培育无产阶级革命事业接班人的大学校。我们公社的几百名知识青年，正沿着毛主席指引的革命大道阔步向前。今后，我们要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，狠揭狠批中国赫鲁晓夫在知识青年上山下乡方面的罪行，用自己的战斗实践，绘出我国社会主义农村的最新最美的画图，写成知识青年在广阔天地里战斗的新篇章！
