Paris students, defying the ban imposed by the French ruling clique, held a demonstration on the 16th in the bustling area on the right bank of the Seine River. They protested against the savage suppression of workers and students by the French ruling clique. The demonstrators engaged in fierce struggles with fully armed police.

After staging the farce of the National Assembly elections and cobbling together a new government, the French ruling clique openly threatened to tighten the suppression of street demonstrations. However, where there is oppression, there is resistance. On the evening of the 16th, hundreds of Paris students gathered in front of the Comédie-Française, defying the authorities' prior ban on the demonstration. They protested against the French ruling clique's dissolution of numerous workers' and students' organizations in June. The French ruling clique mobilized a large number of police to lie in wait near the theater. As soon as the students assembled, the police charged at them, wielding batons. The demonstrating students were fearless, singing the "Internationale" loudly and bravely fighting back with glass cups and bottles. The police brutally arrested about a hundred students.

Prior to this, on the 14th, Paris students held demonstrations in the Bastille Square and the university district, protesting against the government's suppression of students and engaging in struggles with the police.

On the same day, similar demonstrations were also held in the eastern city of Besançon and the southern city of Bordeaux.

    那里有压迫　那里就有反抗
    巴黎学生蔑视禁令再次上街示威
    反动当局调集警察进行伏击　学生不畏强暴高唱《国际歌》英勇反击
    新华社十七日讯 巴黎消息：巴黎学生不顾法国统治集团的禁令，十六日在塞纳河右岸的闹市区举行示威，抗议法国统治集团对工人和学生运动的野蛮镇压，示威学生同全副武装的警察进行了激烈的搏斗。
    法国统治集团在不久前上演了国民议会选举丑剧和拼凑了新政府之后，公然威胁要对街头示威加紧进行镇压。但是，那里有压迫，那里就有反抗。十六日晚间，数百名巴黎学生，蔑视当局事先宣布禁止举行这次示威的命令，聚集在法兰西喜剧院前面，抗议法国统治集团在六月间悍然解散大批工人和学生组织。法国统治集团调动大批警察预先埋伏在剧院附近，在学生集合后，他们便挥舞警棍，向学生冲击。示威学生毫不畏惧，高唱《国际歌》，并用玻璃杯和瓶子等进行英勇反击。警察野蛮地逮捕了大约一百名学生。
    在这之前，巴黎学生十四日先后在巴士底广场和大学区举行了示威，抗议政府镇压学生，并同警察进行了搏斗。
    同一天，在东部的贝尚松和南部的波尔多也举行了类似的示威。
