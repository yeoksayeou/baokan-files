On one morning in early July, the classroom of the 1966 graduating class of Red Guard Primary School in Changwu Town, Changwu County, Liaoning Province, continuously echoed with shouts of "Long live Chairman Mao! Long, long live Chairman Mao!" and slogans of "Down with the Chinese Khrushchev!"

It turned out that the night before, the students had happily viewed the dazzling revolutionary oil painting "Chairman Mao Goes to Anyuan," seeing the great image of the great leader Chairman Mao personally igniting the revolutionary flames of Anyuan. They could not suppress their excitement and joy, unanimously deciding to hold a criticism meeting the next morning. They would use the black textbook "Worker Representative," personally edited by the mouthpiece of the Chinese Khrushchev and the great demon king, Lu Dingyi, as the material. They would severely criticize the great traitor, great swindler, and the biggest capitalist-roader within the party, the Chinese Khrushchev.

That morning, more than 120 students, holding red copies of Chairman Mao's Little Red Book, singing "The Ship Needs a Helmsman," gathered under the oil painting "Chairman Mao Goes to Anyuan." They were filled with boundless proletarian love for the great helmsman Chairman Mao and deep hatred for the Chinese Khrushchev. Everyone was indignant, each eager to speak, tearing off the masks of the Chinese Khrushchev's so-called "old revolutionary" and "worker representative."

Li Chunying, a daughter of a poor peasant, looked at the revolutionary oil painting "Chairman Mao Goes to Anyuan," her heart surging with emotion, her blood boiling. A red sun that never sets rose in her heart. She couldn't help but shout repeatedly, "Wish Chairman Mao a long, long life! Long, long life!" She excitedly said, "Anyuan is the red land personally pioneered by our great leader Chairman Mao. He has gone to Anyuan many times to personally sow the seeds of revolution. He personally initiated and led the Anyuan miners' great strike. He personally deployed the Autumn Harvest Uprising that shook the world in Anyuan, opening the course for the victory of the Chinese revolution. However, the Chinese Khrushchev has long been falsifying history, boasting about himself as an 'old revolutionary' and 'leader of the workers' movement.' His mouthpieces, the likes of Lu Dingyi, have been singing his praises, even including a lesson 'Worker Representative' in our primary school textbooks to build monuments for the Chinese Khrushchev. This is utterly shameless. What 'old revolutionary' is the Chinese Khrushchev? He is a thorough counter-revolutionary! What 'worker representative' is he? He is an unrepentant traitor to the working class! We must criticize the Chinese Khrushchev so thoroughly that he stinks worse than dog shit, ensuring he never rises again!"

At this time, the 16-year-old Chen Yuxia added, "Fake is fake, and the disguise must be torn off. The black textbook 'Worker Representative' tries to beautify the Chinese Khrushchev, boasting about how he remained calm in front of the enemy. Is that true? No, it is not! He is a shameful traitor who has knelt down before imperialists and the reactionary Kuomintang many times. He is the executioner who strangled the workers' movement. Let's see what the Chinese Khrushchev did in Anyuan: When the working class was preparing to use force against the capitalists, he opposed the workers' strike, strongly advocating 'economic struggle' and 'civilized struggle.' When the workers' strike struggle had already ignited, he criticized the workers, saying, 'Speak slowly, why the fire?' When the angry workers rushed into the police station, he again scolded the workers with the face of a traitor, 'Why are you so savage! Don't be too excited!'... Look: Clearly a traitor to the workers' movement, shamelessly boasting about being the 'leader of the workers' movement'; clearly a coward crawling out of a doghole, fabricating himself as a 'hero' with 'courage all over,' truly shameless!"

Feng Weiying, a worker's child, waved his fist, furious, saying, "The poison of the Chinese Khrushchev must be completely eradicated!" He then severely criticized the "philosophy of survival" of the Chinese Khrushchev as propagated in the black textbook "Worker Representative." He spoke more and more angrily, more and more passionately. At this time, the classroom echoed with slogans of "Down with the Chinese Khrushchev!" and "Defend Chairman Mao to the death!" louder and louder.

During the criticism meeting, the students who were infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao were full of fighting spirit. Every word they spoke was like a hammer, ruthlessly smashing the "monument of merit" built for the Chinese Khrushchev; every word they spoke was like a dagger, sharply piercing the "worker representative" mask worn by the Chinese Khrushchev. When the criticism meeting ended, the students stood in front of Chairman Mao's portrait and solemnly swore, "Dear Chairman Mao, we are forever loyal to you, to your thoughts, to your revolutionary line. We will take Comrade Lin Biao as our shining example, forever read your books, listen to your words, act according to your instructions, and be your most loyal little red guards. We vow to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!"

    毛主席，我们永远忠于您！
    ——记红卫小学学生喜看革命油画《毛主席去安源》，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫
    七月初的一天上午，辽宁省彰武县彰武镇公社红卫小学一九六六年应届毕业生的教室里，不断传出“毛主席万岁！毛主席万万岁！”的欢呼声，不断传出“打倒中国赫鲁晓夫！”的口号声。
    原来，头天晚上，同学们幸福地看到了光彩夺目的革命油画《毛主席去安源》，看到了伟大领袖毛主席亲自点燃安源革命烈火的伟大形象，抑制不住内心的激动和喜悦，一致决定：在第二天上午，以中国赫鲁晓夫的吹鼓手、大阎王陆定一亲自主持编写的黑课文《工人代表》为活材料，召开批判会，狠批大叛徒、大工贼、党内最大的走资派中国赫鲁晓夫。
    这天上午，一百二十多名同学，手捧红彤彤的革命宝书《毛主席语录》，高唱《大海航行靠舵手》，聚集在《毛主席去安源》的油画下。他们满怀对伟大统帅毛主席无限热爱的无产阶级感情，怀着对中国赫鲁晓夫的刻骨仇恨，人人义愤填膺，个个争先发言，把中国赫鲁晓夫的什么“老革命”、什么“工人代表”的画皮，统统剥开了。
    贫农女儿李春颖望着《毛主席去安源》这幅革命油画，心潮滚滚，热血沸腾，心中升起了一轮永远不落的红太阳，她情不自禁地一遍又一遍地高呼：“祝愿毛主席万寿无疆！万寿无疆！”她激动地说：“安源，是我们伟大领袖毛主席亲手开拓的红色土地。他老人家多次到安源亲手撒下了革命的火种，他老人家亲自发动和领导了安源路矿工人大罢工，他老人家在安源亲自部署了震撼世界的秋收起义，开辟了中国革命胜利的航程。可是，中国赫鲁晓夫长期以来，篡改历史，把自己吹嘘成‘老革命’‘工人运动的领袖’。他的吹鼓手们，陆定一之流更是主唱奴随，还在我们小学课本里炮制了《工人代表》一课，为中国赫鲁晓夫树碑立传，真是无耻已极。中国赫鲁晓夫是什么‘老革命’？是地地道道的老反革命！是什么‘工人代表’？是不折不扣的工人阶级的大叛徒！我们一定要把中国赫鲁晓夫批得比臭狗屎还臭，叫他永世不得翻身！”
    这时十六岁的陈玉侠接着说：“假的就是假的，伪装应当剥去。《工人代表》这篇黑课文，极力美化中国赫鲁晓夫，吹嘘他在敌人面前如何从容不迫，事实果真是这样吗？不是，根本不是！他是个多次跪倒在帝国主义和国民党反动派脚下的可耻叛徒，他是扼杀工人运动的大刽子手。让我们看看中国赫鲁晓夫在安源到底干了些什么吧：当工人阶级准备以暴力对付资本家的时候，是他反对工人罢工，极力提倡‘经济斗争’、‘文明斗争’。当工人罢工斗争的怒火已经燃烧起来的时候，是他指责工人说：‘有话慢慢说，为什么要动火呢？’当愤怒的工人冲进警察所的时候，又是他以一个工贼的嘴脸呵斥工人：‘你们为什么那样野蛮！不要太激动了！’……请看：明明是出卖工人运动的大工贼，却无耻地吹嘘自己是‘工人运动的领袖’；明明是从狗洞里爬出来的怕死鬼，却编造自己是‘浑身是胆’的‘英雄’，真是死不要脸！”
    工人子弟冯维英挥舞着拳头，怒不可遏地说：“中国赫鲁晓夫的流毒，必须全部肃清！”接着，他狠批了《工人代表》这篇黑课文里宣扬的中国赫鲁晓夫的“活命哲学”。他越说越气愤，越说越激昂，这时，教室里“打倒中国赫鲁晓夫！”“誓死保卫毛主席！”的口号声一阵高过一阵。
    批判会上，无限忠于毛主席的革命的同学们，斗志昂扬，句句发言，就象铁锤，无情地砸烂了吹捧中国赫鲁晓夫的“功德碑”；句句发言，就象匕首，锋利地戳穿了中国赫鲁晓夫披着的“工人代表”的画皮。批判会结束的时候，同学们激动地站在毛主席像前庄严宣誓：“敬爱的毛主席，我们永远忠于您，忠于您的思想，忠于您的革命路线。决心以林副主席为光辉榜样，永远读您的书，听您的话，照您的指示办事，做您最忠实的红小兵，誓把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！”
