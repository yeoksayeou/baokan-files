The revolutionary people and cadres of Xingtai region, Hebei Province, with deep proletarian sentiments, are studying from the People's Liberation Army.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Shijiazhuang, July 28th: The revolutionary people and cadres of Xingtai region, Hebei Province, following the great leader Chairman Mao's great teaching of "the entire nation should learn from the People's Liberation Army," with deep proletarian sentiments, have been persistently and deeply carrying out the activity of learning from the PLA. They, like the PLA, read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, and fully implement Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, achieving victory after victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The revolutionary and production situation in the entire region is excellent and getting better and better.

Two years ago, Xingtai region experienced a strong earthquake. At that time, a certain unit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army immediately formed a "Ten-Thousand-Person Propaganda Team of Mao Zedong Thought," day and night, rushing to the disaster area to rescue people's lives and property, arming the broad masses of the disaster area with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, helping the masses to fight against nature and achieve great victory in the anti-disaster struggle. In the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the broad cadres and soldiers of the PLA's "Ten-Thousand-Person Propaganda Team of Mao Zedong Thought," following Chairman Mao's great instruction of "the People's Liberation Army should support the broad leftist masses," returned to Xingtai region several times, going deep into communes, production teams, and the homes of commune members, timely delivering Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the hearts of the poor and lower-middle peasants, and helping revolutionary masses to hold Mao Zedong Thought study classes, carrying out revolutionary criticism. In the fierce struggle between the two classes, two lines, and two roads, the PLA and the broad revolutionary masses of the proletariat fought side by side, smashing the various plots of the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, and achieving decisive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in the entire region.

The great People's Liberation Army is infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, emphasizing proletarian politics, studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought actively, adhering to the Four Firsts, and promoting the Three-Eighths Style. These fine traditions are deeply imprinted in the minds of the broad poor and lower-middle peasants and workers in Xingtai region. They say, the PLA is the children of the laboring people and also a good example for us to learn from. We must respond to the great call of the great leader Chairman Mao and learn from the PLA.

Vice Chairman Lin said: "The attitude towards Mao Zedong Thought is a very important issue. We must grasp the issue of attitude towards Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought." The revolutionary people of Xingtai region, in the activity of learning from the PLA, following Vice Chairman Lin's instruction, take the PLA's infinite loyalty to Chairman Mao, infinite loyalty to Mao Zedong Thought, and infinite loyalty to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line as a shining example, firmly grasping the issue of attitude towards Chairman Mao, Mao Zedong Thought, and Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Over the past year, many communes and production teams have focused on class education, carrying out the "Three Remembrances and Three Comparisons" activities: remembering the bitterness of the old society and comparing the sweetness of the new society; remembering the bitterness of the capitalist reactionary line and comparing the sweetness of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line; remembering the bitterness of individual farming and comparing the sweetness of socialist collectivization. Through these activities, the broad revolutionary masses and cadres have an even deeper love for the great leader Chairman Mao. In every village and town, one can see the portraits of the great leader Chairman Mao and the red and shining Mao quotes boards. Every household has Chairman Mao's revolutionary books. The broad revolutionary masses regard studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought actively as the first need in life. Currently, the entire region has held more than 400,000 various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, with more than 2.3 million participants, accounting for more than 80% of the adult population. Through holding Mao Zedong Thought study classes, the revolutionary great alliance and revolutionary three-in-one combination have been effectively promoted, driving the revolutionary criticism and the work of purging the class ranks.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "One of our important tasks on the ideological front now is to carry out a criticism of revisionism." The broad poor and lower-middle peasants of Xingtai region, in the activity of learning from the PLA, taking the PLA's ruthlessness towards the enemy as an example, carry out deep and persistent revolutionary criticism, actively launching fierce attacks on the class enemies. They take the study classes as the battlefield, through big-character posters, blackboard newspapers, cartoons, slide shows, and criticism meetings and struggle meetings, fiercely criticizing the revisionist black goods advocated by China's Khrushchev, such as the theory of "the extinction of class struggle," and at the same time, exposing the evil activities of the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists who have not been reformed in the village during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, destroying the revolution, destroying production, and inciting the masses to fight against each other. They have smashed the class enemies' arrogant attacks and further consolidated the dictatorship of the proletariat.

The great leader Chairman Mao teaches: "Our Communist Party and the Communist Party-led Eighth Route Army and New Fourth Army are revolutionary armies. This army is completely for the liberation of the people and works thoroughly for the people's interests." The comrades of the PLA's "Ten-Thousand-Person Propaganda Team of Mao Zedong Thought," following Chairman Mao's teaching, during the anti-earthquake relief days two years ago, put the people's interests first, appearing wherever it was most dangerous and difficult. The revolutionary masses and cadres of Xingtai region, in the activity of learning from the PLA, all take the PLA's "Ten-Thousand-Person Propaganda Team" that serves the people wholeheartedly as an example, firmly grasping their own ideological transformation, establishing the worldview of "completely" and "thoroughly" serving the people. The broad grassroots revolutionary cadres in the rural areas of this region learn from the PLA, firmly breaking private interests and establishing public interests. The broad militia members in various communes and production teams in this region, in the activity of learning from the PLA, have played a leading and exemplary role.

    河北省邢台地区广大革命人民和革命干部
    怀着深厚无产阶级感情向人民解放军学习
    据新华社石家庄二十八日电　河北省邢台地区广大革命人民和革命干部，遵循伟大领袖毛主席“全国学人民解放军”的伟大教导，怀着深厚的无产阶级感情，持久深入地开展学习解放军的活动。他们象人民解放军那样，读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，全面落实毛主席的一系列最新指示，取得了无产阶级文化大革命的节节胜利，全区革命和生产形势一片大好，越来越好。
    两年前，邢台地区曾经发生了一次强烈地震。当时，中国人民解放军某部立即组成毛泽东思想“万人宣传队”，昼夜兼程奔赴灾区，抢救人民生命财产，用战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装灾区广大群众，帮助群众战天斗地，取得了抗灾斗争的伟大胜利。在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命运动中，解放军毛泽东思想“万人宣传队”的广大指战员，遵照毛主席“人民解放军应该支持左派广大群众”的伟大指示，几次重返邢台地区，深入公社、生产队和社员家里，及时把毛主席关于无产阶级文化大革命的一系列最新指示送到贫下中农的心坎上，并且帮助革命群众举办毛泽东思想学习班，开展革命大批判。在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的激烈搏斗中，解放军和广大无产阶级革命派并肩战斗，粉碎了党内一小撮走资派的种种阴谋，全区无产阶级文化大革命取得了决定性的胜利。
    伟大的中国人民解放军，无限忠于毛主席，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，突出无产阶级政治，活学活用毛泽东思想，坚持四个第一，大兴三八作风，这些优良传统，深深地印在邢台地区广大贫下中农和工人群众的脑海里。他们说，解放军是咱劳动人民的子弟兵，又是咱学习的好榜样。咱们一定响应伟大领袖毛主席的伟大号召，向解放军学习。
    林副主席说：“对毛泽东思想抱什么态度，是一个很重要的问题。我们就是要抓对毛主席的态度、对毛泽东思想的态度问题。”邢台地区广大革命人民在大学解放军的活动中，根据林副主席的指示，以解放军无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于毛泽东思想，无限忠于毛主席的革命路线为光辉榜样，狠抓对毛主席，对毛泽东思想，对毛主席革命路线的态度问题。一年多来，许多社队大抓阶级教育，开展“三忆三比”活动：忆旧社会的苦，比新社会的甜；忆资产阶级反动路线的苦，比毛主席革命路线的甜；忆单干的苦，比社会主义集体化的甜。通过这些活动，广大革命群众和革命干部更加无限热爱伟大领袖毛主席。村村镇镇，随处可以看到伟大领袖毛主席的画像和红光闪闪的毛主席语录牌，家家户户都有毛主席的革命宝书。广大革命群众把活学活用毛泽东思想当作生活的第一需要，目前，全区已举办各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班四十多万个，参加学习的达二百三十多万人，占全区成年人的百分之八十以上。通过大办毛泽东思想学习班，有力地促进了革命大联合和革命三结合，推动了革命大批判和清理阶级队伍的工作。
    毛主席教导我们：“我们现在思想战线上的一个重要任务，就是要开展对于修正主义的批判。”邢台地区广大贫下中农在学习解放军的活动中，以解放军对敌狠为榜样，深入持久地开展革命大批判，主动地向阶级敌人发动猛烈进攻。他们以学习班为战场，通过大字报、黑板报、漫画、幻灯和批判会、斗争会，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫鼓吹的“阶级斗争熄灭”论等反革命修正主义黑货，同时大揭本村的没有改造好的地、富、反、坏、右分子在无产阶级文化大革命中破坏革命，破坏生产，挑动群众斗群众的罪恶活动，粉碎了阶级敌人的猖狂进攻，进一步巩固了无产阶级专政。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导说：“我们的共产党和共产党所领导的八路军、新四军，是革命的队伍。我们这个队伍完全是为着解放人民的，是彻底地为人民的利益工作的。”人民解放军毛泽东思想“万人宣传队”的同志，遵照毛主席的教导，在两年前抗震救灾的日子里，一切从人民的利益出发，哪里最危险、最困难，他们就在哪里出现。邢台地区的广大革命群众和革命干部在大学解放军的活动中，都以全心全意为人民服务的解放军“万人宣传队”为榜样，狠抓自己的思想革命化，树立“完全”“彻底”为人民服务的世界观。这个地区的广大农村基层革命干部，向解放军学习，狠狠地破私立公。这个地区各社、队的广大民兵在向解放军学习的活动中，发挥了骨干和带头作用。
