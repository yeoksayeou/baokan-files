The Hudong Shipyard by the Huangpu River is everywhere showing the scene of dual victories in revolution and production. Rows of big-character posters reflect the victorious battles of shipyard workers attacking class enemies; one new ship after another, loaded with the shipyard workers' boundless loyalty to Chairman Mao, sets sail for the ocean.

When shipyard workers discuss the excellent situation, they all excitedly say, this is the result of the Revolutionary Committee, with the help of the People's Liberation Army Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team, leading us to closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, deeply and persistently carry out the revolutionary criticism, and accurately and resolutely strike down a handful of class enemies.

	The Backdrop of the Dispute

	One morning, after a long time on the job, some young workers like Xiao Chang in a certain workshop were still playing around. Xiao Zhang couldn't stand it anymore and said, "Hurry up and work! The production task is waiting for us to complete." Xiao Chang immediately retorted, "If you want to work, you work. We will not work until the problems in the workshop are thoroughly resolved." Xiao Zhang countered, "Your direction is wrong." Xiao Chang suddenly rushed up to Xiao Zhang and shouted, "The Revolutionary Committee has been established, and it's time to solve the welfare problems of the workers." At this moment, a bad element quickly chimed in, "Yes, yes, Xiao Chang and the others are 'rebelling' for the long-term plan! If we don't ensure our bodies, how can we work for the revolution in the long run?" Xiao Zhang angrily said, "You are driven by the 'self' character, putting life first." The argument became more intense, and the bad element added fuel to the fire. Xiao Zhang and Xiao Chang argued fiercely.

	There is no smoke without fire. Since this year, production in this workshop has been poor. A handful of capitalist roaders coldly remarked, "You can't do it, if you want to focus on production, you still need us!" The big-character posters attacking the Revolutionary Committee also said, "The new leaders are not as good as the old leaders." Under these circumstances, some comrades in the Revolutionary Committee couldn't stay calm. They thought: it's time to focus on living conditions. The capitalist roaders are challenging us, we must show them what we're made of. Therefore, the Revolutionary Committee once concentrated its efforts on solving the production and living conditions of this workshop. However, the problems still could not be resolved. They solved the issue of masks, saying, "They are too thin and don't block the dust"; they issued thick ones, saying, "They are too thick and make it hard to breathe"...

	The Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team saw all this and took it to heart: these young workers, during the Cultural Revolution, fearlessly defended Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Why are they suddenly making a fuss about living conditions now? They immediately pointed out that this is not a production problem, not a living problem, but a serious class struggle!

	The comrades from the Propaganda Team and the members of the factory Revolutionary Committee seriously studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is, in essence, a great political revolution under the conditions of socialism, a continuation of the long-term struggle between the Chinese Communist Party and the reactionary Kuomintang led by the broad revolutionary masses, and a continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie." Everyone deeply realized: the desperate class enemies seized the "self" character in some people's minds, stirring up the counter-revolutionary wind of economism. They are not after material benefits but want to seize the political power of the proletariat!

	The comrades of the Revolutionary Committee immediately went deep into the workshops, held extensive Mao Zedong Thought study classes, and led the workers to study Chairman Mao's latest instructions, recall bitterness and sweetness, fight against selfishness and criticize revisionism, and fiercely criticize the survival philosophy of China's Khrushchev. The broad masses quickly raised their awareness of class struggle and two-line struggle, exposing and reporting, and finally unearthed this long-hidden remnant of the Kuomintang. The young worker Xiao Chang, who had once been deceived and misled, angrily denounced at the criticism and struggle meeting, "Now I see clearly the class enemy!" Through this struggle, the broad revolutionary masses deeply felt: the "self" character makes us deaf to the sound of class struggle, mute to the roar of revolution, and blind to distinguishing friends from enemies. Everyone said: we must not only eliminate the hidden class enemies in the revolutionary ranks but also constantly break with selfishness and establish public-mindedness, and eliminate the "self" character, this enemy, in our minds. Now the face of this workshop has greatly improved, and production is booming.

	The Malicious "Counter-Performance"

	As soon as the Revolutionary Committee of the Shipbuilding Workshop was established, it vigorously carried out the revolutionary criticism, fiercely criticizing China's Khrushchev and his agents in this unit. The entire workshop was in a good situation of revolution and production. Just at this time, a combat organization suddenly appeared in the shipyard section, with someone acting as an advisor, fiercely criticizing an erring cadre. They deliberately spread the word everywhere, saying, "The scope of criticism should be wider, and the content should be richer. The capitalist roaders have been criticized enough, and it's time to fight against bad tendencies." The capitalist roaders saw an opportunity and jumped out, shouting, "We are old problems, there is nothing to criticize and struggle against." They maliciously confused two types of contradictions of different natures, attempting to disrupt our class lines.

	What are they up to? Some of the masses were momentarily confused, thinking this was a "hotchpotch" counter-performance, but the comrades from the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team did not see it that way. They and the comrades from the Revolutionary Committee studied together Chairman Mao's teachings: "In the long historical period after the proletariat seizes power, the continuation of class struggle is an objective law that does not change with people's will, only the form of class struggle is different from before the proletariat seizes power." Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's brilliant thoughts, the comrades of the Revolutionary Committee further analyzed the characteristics of the class struggle situation and unanimously believed that this was the desperate struggle of the class enemies. They used the cunning method of shifting the direction of struggle, treating internal contradictions among the people as contradictions between the enemy and us, attempting to escape the punishment of the revolutionary masses.

	"Whatever the enemy opposes, we support; whatever the enemy supports, we oppose." The broad revolutionary masses followed Chairman Mao's teachings and engaged in a head-on struggle with the enemy. To thoroughly expose the enemy's conspiracy and win over and educate the deceived masses, the entire workshop carried out an in-depth revolutionary criticism. Through mass exposure and criticism, the special agent who acted as the backstage of the "counter-performance" was finally unearthed.

    在革命工人的铁拳下
    ——沪东造船厂阶级斗争中的故事
    黄浦江畔的沪东造船厂，到处呈现着革命和生产双胜利的景象。一排排大字报专栏，反映着造船工人向阶级敌人进攻的胜利战斗；一艘艘新船，满载着造船工人无限忠于毛主席的赤胆忠心，驶向海洋。
    造船工人畅谈大好形势时，都激动地说，这是革命委员会在解放军毛泽东思想宣传队帮助下，领导我们紧跟毛主席伟大战略部署，深入持久地开展革命大批判，稳、准、狠地打击一小撮阶级敌人的光辉战果。
    纠　纷　的　背　后
    一天上午，已经上班很久了，某车间的青年工人小常等人还在玩。小张实在看不过去了，就说：“快干活吧！生产任务在等待我们完成。”小常劈头就是一句：“要干你干，不彻底解决车间的问题，我们坚决不干。”小张反驳说：“你们这样做，大方向错了。”小常一下子冲到小张跟前，大声说：“革命委员会建立了，也该解决工人的福利问题了。”这时一个坏蛋赶忙凑过来说：“对，对，小常他们
  ‘造反’是为长远打算嘛！不把身体保证好，怎能长期为革命工作呀？”小张气愤地说：“你们这是‘私’字作怪，活命第一。”辩论越来越激烈，那个坏蛋在一旁添油加醋，小张和小常争吵得不可开交了。
    无风不起浪。今年以来，这个车间生产一直搞不好。一小撮走资派冷言冷语地说：“你们不行，抓生产嘛，还是要我们来！”攻击革委会的大字报上也说什么：“新当权派不如老当权派”。在这种情况下，革委会中有的同志沉不住气了，认为：是抓生活的时候了，走资派在向我们挑战，咱要争口气，做出个样儿来给他们看看。因此，革委会曾经集中力量抓了这个车间的生产和生活。可是，问题仍旧得不到解决。解决了口罩，说“太薄，不挡灰”；发厚的，又说：“太厚，呼吸困难”。……
    毛泽东思想宣传队把这一切都看在眼里，想在心上：这些青年工人在文化大革命中，为捍卫毛主席的革命路线，奋不顾身，为什么现在却突然闹起生活问题来了？他们立刻指出，这不是生产问题，不是生活问题，这是一场严肃的阶级斗争！
    宣传队同志和厂革委会成员一起认真学习了毛主席的最新指示：“无产阶级文化大革命，实质上是在社会主义条件下，无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命，是中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续，是无产阶级和资产阶级阶级斗争的继续。”大家深刻地认识到：穷途末路的阶级敌人，抓住有些人头脑中资产阶级的“私”字，煽动反革命经济主义妖风。他们决不是要物质福利，而是要夺取无产阶级的政权！
  　革委会同志立即深入车间，大办毛泽东思想学习班，大学毛主席的最新指示，引导工人忆苦思甜，斗私批修，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫的活命哲学。广大群众迅速提高了阶级斗争和两条路线斗争的觉悟，纷纷揭发检举，终于挖出了这个隐藏多年的国民党残渣余孽。一度受过欺骗和蒙蔽的青年工人小常，在批判斗争会上，愤怒地控诉说：“这下我可认清了阶级敌人！”通过这次斗争，广大革命群众深切地体会到：“私”字使我们有耳听不见阶级斗争的风浪声，有喉发不出革命的怒吼声，有眼分不清敌我。大家说：我们既要清除混入革命队伍的暗藏的阶级敌人，也要不断破私立公，肃清自己头脑中“私”字这个敌人。现在这个车间面貌大为改观，生产蒸蒸日上。
    恶毒的“对台戏”
    船体车间革命委员会一成立，就狠抓革命大批判，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫及其在本单位的代理人，整个车间革命和生产形势一片大好。就在这当儿，船台工段忽然冒出来一个战斗组织，由某人作顾问，大批特批一个犯有错误的干部。他们故意到处散布说：“大批判的面应该宽一点，内容丰富一点。走资派已经批得差不多了，该向不良倾向作斗争了。”走资派见有机可乘，也跳出来叫喊：“我们都是老问题了，没有什么可批斗了。”他们恶毒地混淆两类不同性质的矛盾，妄图把我们的阶级阵线搅乱。
    他们到底在干什么？少数群众一时蒙在鼓里，有人认为这是“凑热闹”的“对台戏”，但毛泽东思想宣传队同志不这样看。他们和革委会的同志一起，学习了毛主席的教导：“在无产阶级获得政权以后的一个很长的历史时期中，阶级斗争的继续，仍然是不以人们意志为转移的客观规律，只是阶级斗争的形式不同于无产阶级取得政权以前。”在毛主席的光辉思想指引下，革命委员会的同志们进一步分析了阶级斗争形势的特点，一致认为，这是阶级敌人的垂死挣扎。他们采用转移斗争大方向的毒辣手段，把人民内部矛盾当作敌我矛盾，妄图逃避革命群众的惩罚。
      “凡是敌人反对的，我们就要拥护；凡是敌人拥护的，我们就要反对。”广大革命群众遵循毛主席的教导，同敌人进行针锋相对的斗争。为了彻底揭露阶级敌人的阴谋，争取和教育受蒙蔽的群众，全车间深入地开展了革命大批判。通过群众性的大揭发、大批判，那个充当“对台戏”后台的特务分子，终于被挖了出来。　东左
