The Revolutionary Committee of Ganzhou Prefecture established a command center for promoting revolution and production. We immediately changed the bloated and cumbersome old prefectural government structure, significantly reducing the number of personnel and dividing them into six groups to handle the work of the original twenty-seven departments and bureaus. Later, most of the staff returned to their original units to carry out struggles against the enemy and clean up class ranks. Only about a dozen people remained to work every day. With fewer people and heavier tasks, what should we do? We brought the problems we encountered in our work to a study class on Mao Zedong Thought. We organized everyone to study Chairman Mao's teachings on "Political work is the lifeline of all economic work" and Vice Chairman Lin's instructions on highlighting proletarian politics. We criticized the crimes of the Chinese Khrushchev for opposing the highlighting of politics and for promoting a revisionist line in the construction of political power. We examined our past failures to highlight proletarian politics and our detached attitude towards the masses, recognizing the harm caused by the old system's reliance on material incentives and bureaucratic management. The newly established Revolutionary Committee must rely on political leadership and Mao Zedong Thought.

Through the study class on Mao Zedong Thought, our understanding deepened, our direction became clear, our confidence was strengthened, and we found a way forward. Everyone voluntarily used Mao Zedong Thought to guide everything, voluntarily used Mao Zedong Thought to transform their souls and guide their work, establishing a new revolutionary style for the Revolutionary Committee. The committee's staff went deep into the masses, conducting thorough and meticulous investigative work. We discovered two model brigades in Xingguo County: Changgang Brigade and Jiaoxi Brigade. These two brigades held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, responding to Chairman Mao's call to "Learn from Dazhai in agriculture." They fiercely criticized the Chinese Khrushchev's fallacies of "three freedoms and one contract," building socialist new rural areas through self-reliance. With the spirit of moving mountains like Yu Gong, they transformed the poor mountains into a red school of Mao Zedong Thought. We promptly helped them summarize their experiences and promoted them throughout the prefecture. We held two on-site meetings there, organizing emulation and mutual aid, and soon the spirit of Changgang and Jiaoxi spread everywhere, and the flowers of Dazhai bloomed everywhere.

Several months of work practice made us deeply realize that only by taking the path of streamlining administration and highlighting proletarian politics, grasping the essentials, and thoroughly revolutionizing the newly established Revolutionary Committee, can we lead the broad masses of the people to create first-rate work.

    狠抓根本突出无产阶级政治
    赣州专区革委会常委、军队代表　黄树欣
    我们赣州专区革委会抓革命促生产指挥部一建立，就改变了旧专署臃肿、庞杂的旧机构，把人员大大减少了，分六个小组，担负原来专署二十七个处局的工作。后来大部分工作人员又回原单位开展对敌斗争，清理阶级队伍，每天坚持工作的就剩十多个人。人员少，任务重，怎么办？我们带着工作中的问题，举办了毛泽东思想学习班，组织大家学习毛主席“政治工作是一切经济工作的生命线”的教导，和林副主席关于突出无产阶级政治的指示，批判中国赫鲁晓夫反对突出政治，在政权建设方面推行的修正主义路线的罪行，检查自己过去不突出无产阶级政治，脱离群众的作风给革命带来的损失，使大家认识到旧机构靠物质挂帅，业务挂帅的危害。新生的革委会一定要靠政治挂帅，靠毛泽东思想挂帅。
    通过举办毛泽东思想学习班，提高了认识，明确了方向，坚定了信心，找到了办法。大家自觉地用毛泽东思想统帅一切，自觉地用毛泽东思想改造自己的灵魂，指导自己的工作，使革命委员会建立了崭新的革命作风。革委会的工作人员，深入到群众中去，做艰苦细致的调查研究工作。我们发现兴国县长冈大队和蕉溪大队两个典型。这两个大队高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，响应毛主席
  “农业学大寨”的号召，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫“三自一包”的谬论，自力更生建设社会主义新农村，以愚公移山的精神改天换地，把穷山沟办成了红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校。我们及时帮助他们总结经验，在全区推广。在那里先后开了两次现场会，组织比学赶帮，很快长冈、蕉溪精神就处处传，大寨之花遍地开。
    几个月的工作实践，使我们深深体会到，只有走精兵简政的道路，突出无产阶级政治，狠抓根本，使新生的革委会彻底革命化，才能带领广大人民群众创造出第一等的工作来。　（新华社发、本报有删改）
