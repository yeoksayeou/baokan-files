The revolutionary committee of Qingdao's Sifang District uses Mao Zedong Thought study classes as a base to mobilize and organize the broad masses of revolutionaries in the entire district, forming a mighty revolutionary army, and steadfastly, accurately, and resolutely striking down a handful of class enemies.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, July 15 — The revolutionary committee of Qingdao's Sifang District persistently holds and conducts Mao Zedong Thought study classes well, and with the victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, it adds new content to the study, implements Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and continuously raises the revolutionary masses' awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines. Thus, the current work of fighting against the enemy and cleaning up the class ranks in this district is carried out vigorously and solidly, achieving continuous new victories.

The great leader Chairman Mao teaches: "Holding study classes is a good method; many problems can be solved in study classes." The revolutionary committee of Sifang District follows Chairman Mao's teachings and has always insisted on holding and conducting Mao Zedong Thought study classes well, using the study classes as a powerful force to promote the victory of all work. When this district carried out the work of cleaning up the class ranks, they further used Mao Zedong Thought study classes as a base to mobilize and organize the broad masses of revolutionaries in the entire district to the fullest extent. The broad masses of revolutionaries in the study classes actively learn and apply Chairman Mao's series of brilliant instructions on the struggle against the enemy, implement the party's policies, and powerfully promote the victory of the struggle against the enemy. Currently, the more than 27,000 various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes spread throughout the district have become a vast battlefield for the broad masses of revolutionaries in the entire Sifang District to carry out the struggle against the enemy, steadily, accurately, and resolutely striking down a handful of class enemies.

Before the work of cleaning up the class ranks was fully launched throughout the district, the district revolutionary committee first held a large-scale Mao Zedong Thought study class with over 800 participants. This study class included leaders from the revolutionary committee and revolutionary mass organizations, as well as revolutionary cadres and representatives from various systems, units, and departments. In this study class, everyone repeatedly studied and discussed Chairman Mao's latest series of instructions on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, using Chairman Mao's teachings on class and class struggle to arm their minds. Under the influence of this study class, various sub-districts, residents' committees, residents' groups, families, as well as various government agencies, factories, and schools, also held Mao Zedong Thought study classes with the main content of carrying out the struggle against the enemy. The number of people participating in the study classes accounted for 95% of the total revolutionary people in the district. Thus, through holding study classes, not only was the most thorough ideological and public opinion preparation done for the work of cleaning up the class ranks throughout the district, but also the tens of thousands of revolutionary masses in the entire district were mobilized and organized to the broadest extent, forming a mighty revolutionary army. After the work of cleaning up the class ranks was fully launched, the district revolutionary committee linked all the Mao Zedong Thought study classes in the district into a single line. As soon as Chairman Mao's latest instructions were issued, they were immediately spread throughout various industries and households through the large-scale study classes held by the district and the study classes spread throughout the district. The new experiences of implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions in the study classes held below were also promptly reflected upwards, quickly spreading throughout the district.

When the revolutionary committee of Qingdao's Sifang District held Mao Zedong Thought study classes, they always insisted on mobilizing the masses to use Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to launch a revolutionary criticism of the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents, raising the broad masses of revolutionaries' awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines. In the study classes held by the district and various industries and units, the broad masses of revolutionaries seriously studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is, in essence, a great political revolution carried out by the proletariat under the conditions of socialism to oppose the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes, a continuation of the long-term struggle between the Chinese Communist Party and its leadership and the broad revolutionary masses of the people against the Kuomintang reactionaries, and a continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie." They used Chairman Mao's latest instructions as a weapon to severely criticize the "traitor philosophy," "theory of the extinction of class struggle," and the revisionist organizational line of forming cliques and recruiting traitors of the Chinese Khrushchev. Since March this year, the large-scale Mao Zedong Thought study classes held in the district have held nine criticism meetings against the Chinese Khrushchev and a handful of capitalist roaders within the party; the study classes in various industries and units have held more than 10,000 criticism meetings in total. Through persistent and in-depth revolutionary criticism, they powerfully struck down the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents, a handful of class enemies, greatly raising the class consciousness and awareness of the line struggle of the broad masses of revolutionaries.

Through holding study classes, the revolutionary committee of Sifang District organized the masses to conduct in-depth investigations into the new trends and characteristics of class struggle throughout the district, study the strategies for carrying out the struggle against the enemy, and also exchange and promote the experiences of carrying out the struggle against the enemy. For example, they promoted the experiences of carrying out revolutionary criticism and implementing mass dictatorship in the study classes held by the district revolutionary committee, powerfully promoting the in-depth development of revolutionary criticism and the struggle against the enemy in various units.

Because the revolutionary committee of Qingdao's Sifang District insisted on holding and conducting Mao Zedong Thought study classes well, they fundamentally raised the proletarian consciousness of the broad masses of revolutionaries, not only powerfully promoting the development of all work, but also continuously consolidating and developing the revolutionary great alliance and the revolutionary three-in-one combination in terms of ideology, pushing the mass movement of learning and applying Mao Zedong Thought to new heights. They held study classes from top to bottom, all of which carried out bitter-sweet reminiscence activities, making the broad masses of revolutionaries even more hateful of the old society and the Chinese Khrushchev, and even more loving of Chairman Mao and socialism, greatly arousing the proletarian feelings of the broad masses of revolutionaries to be infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, infinitely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and their spiritual outlook has undergone tremendous changes.

    坚持大办学习班推动各项工作胜利发展
    青岛四方区革委会以毛泽东思想学习班为阵地，把全区广大革命群众最广泛地组织起来，汇成一支浩浩荡荡的革命大军，稳准狠地打击一小撮阶级敌人
    据新华社济南十五日电　青岛市四方区革命委员会坚持大办办好毛泽东思想学习班，并且随着无产阶级文化大革命运动的胜利发展，增加新的学习内容，落实毛主席的最新指示，不断提高革命群众的阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟，从而使这个区当前的对敌斗争和清理阶级队伍的工作搞得轰轰烈烈、扎扎实实，不断取得新的胜利。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导说：“办学习班，是个好办法，很多问题可以在学习班得到解决。”四方区革委会遵照毛主席的教导，一直坚持大办办好毛泽东思想学习班，把学习班作为推动各项工作胜利开展的巨大力量。这个区在进行清理阶级队伍这项工作的时候，他们又进一步以毛泽东思想学习班为阵地，把全区广大革命群众最充分地发动和组织起来。广大革命群众在学习班里活学活用毛主席关于对敌斗争的一系列光辉指示，贯彻执行党的方针、政策，有力地促进了对敌斗争的胜利发展。目前，遍布全区的两万七千多个各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，已成为整个四方区广大革命群众开展对敌斗争的广阔战场，稳、准、狠地打击了一小撮阶级敌人。
    在全区清理阶级队伍工作全面展开以前，区革委会首先办起了一个有八百多人参加的大型毛泽东思想学习班。这个学习班有革委会、革命群众组织的负责人参加，有各系统、各单位、各部门的革命干部和革命群众代表参加，在这个学习班上，大家反复学习和讨论毛主席关于无产阶级文化大革命的一系列最新指示，用毛主席关于阶级和阶级斗争的教导武装头脑。在这个学习班的带动下，各管区、居民委员会、居民小组、家庭，以及各机关、工厂、学校，也以开展对敌斗争为主要内容，办起了毛泽东思想学习班。参加学习班的人数，占全区革命人民总数的百分之九十五。这样，通过大办学习班，不仅为全区清理阶级队伍的工作做了最充分的思想和舆论准备，而且把全区十几万革命群众最广泛地组织起来，汇成一支浩浩荡荡的革命大军。在清理阶级队伍工作全面开展后，区革委会又把全区的毛泽东思想学习班上下串连成了一条线。毛主席的最新指示一发表，通过区上办的大型学习班和遍布全区的学习班，立即传遍各行各业、千家万户。下面办的学习班贯彻毛主席最新指示的新经验，也及时反映到上面来，在全区得到迅速推广。
    青岛市四方区革命委员会在大办毛泽东思想学习班的时候，始终坚持发动群众以毛泽东思想为武器，对中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人展开革命大批判，以提高广大革命群众的阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟。在区上和各行各业各单位办的学习班里，广大革命群众认真学习了毛主席的最新指示：“无产阶级文化大革命，实质上是在社会主义条件下，无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命，是中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续，是无产阶级和资产阶级阶级斗争的继续。”他们以毛主席的最新指示为武器，狠批了中国赫鲁晓夫的“叛徒哲学”、“阶级斗争熄灭”论以及结党营私、招降纳叛的反革命修正主义组织路线。今年三月以来，区里办的大型毛泽东思想学习班，一共对中国赫鲁晓夫等党内一小撮走资派开了九次批判会；各行各业各单位的学习班，总共开了一万多次批判会。通过持久深入的革命大批判，有力地打击了中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人等一小撮阶级敌人，大大提高了广大革命群众的阶级觉悟和路线斗争觉悟。
    通过大办学习班，四方区革委会组织群众深入调查全区阶级斗争的新动向、新特点，研究开展对敌斗争的策略，同时还交流和推广了开展对敌斗争的经验。譬如，他们在区革委会办的学习班中推广的有关开展革命大批判和实行群众专政的经验，有力地推动了各单位革命大批判和对敌斗争的深入开展。
    青岛市四方区革委会由于坚持大办办好毛泽东思想学习班，从根本上提高广大革命群众的无产阶级觉悟，不但有力地推动了各项工作的开展，而且从思想上不断巩固和发展了革命大联合和革命三结合，把活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动不断推向新的高潮。他们办的学习班，从上到下都开展了忆苦思甜活动，从而使广大革命群众更加憎恨旧社会和中国赫鲁晓夫，更加热爱毛主席和社会主义，大大激发了广大革命群众无限忠于毛主席、无限忠于毛泽东思想、无限忠于毛主席革命路线的无产阶级感情，精神面貌发生了巨大的变化。
