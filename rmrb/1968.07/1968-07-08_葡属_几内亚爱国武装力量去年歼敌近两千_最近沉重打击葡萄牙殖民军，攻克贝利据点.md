The patriotic armed forces of "Portuguese" Guinea eliminated nearly two thousand enemies last year. Recently, they dealt a heavy blow to the Portuguese colonial army, capturing the Bele stronghold.

	NEW DELHI, July 6 (Xinhua) -- According to a communiqué issued by the patriotic armed forces of "Portuguese" Guinea in Nouakchott on July 5, the Portuguese colonial forces, after suffering heavy losses from the patriotic armed forces of "Portuguese" Guinea, were forced to retreat from the Bele stronghold in the eastern Bué region of "Portuguese" Guinea on June 19. This is one of the major victories achieved by the patriotic armed forces of "Portuguese" Guinea on the eastern front.

	Throughout June, despite the patriotic armed forces' almost daily attacks on the Bele stronghold, the Portuguese colonialists desperately tried to reinforce the garrison. However, they continued to suffer defeats. In two ambushes by the guerrillas, 16 Portuguese colonial soldiers were killed, and seven trucks were completely destroyed.

	On June 14, another unit of the colonial army was ambushed by the patriotic armed forces, and a squadron of Portuguese air force planes sent to provide assistance had one of its American-made fighter-bombers shot down.

	After 12 consecutive days of attacks by the patriotic armed forces, the Portuguese colonialists, in order to avoid the complete annihilation of their garrison, retreated from the Bele stronghold in a disorderly manner under the cover of their air force.

	The communiqué pointed out that in June, the patriotic armed forces also carried out many other major actions in the Bué region.

	On June 19, guerrilla fighters in a raid destroyed the power station inside the Madina stronghold, the only Portuguese stronghold currently in the entire Bué region, and caused significant damage to other facilities.

	On June 17, just as the Portuguese garrison in this stronghold was assembling, the guerrillas launched a sudden attack with mortars, inflicting heavy casualties on the enemy.

	On June 10, 11, and 13, the patriotic armed forces carried out three assaults on the same stronghold, killing eight enemy soldiers.

	On June 30, the patriotic armed forces of "Portuguese" Guinea also issued a communiqué in Dakar, announcing their achievements for 1967.

	According to the communiqué, in 1967, the patriotic armed forces annihilated 1,905 Portuguese colonial soldiers and officers, destroyed 40% of the Portuguese military aircraft stationed in "Portuguese" Guinea and 116 trucks, sank 27 Portuguese naval vessels, and seized a large amount of military equipment.

    “葡属”几内亚爱国武装力量去年歼敌近两千
    最近沉重打击葡萄牙殖民军，攻克贝利据点
    新华社六日讯　努瓦克肖特消息：据“葡属”几内亚爱国武装力量五日在努瓦克肖特发表的公报宣布，葡萄牙殖民军在遭到“葡属”几内亚爱国武装力量的沉重打击后，六月十九日被迫从“葡属”几内亚东部布伊地区的首府贝利据点撤退。这是“葡属”几内亚爱国武装力量在东线所取得的重大胜利之一。
    六月间，在贝利据点几乎每天都遭到爱国武装力量进攻的情况下，葡萄牙殖民主义者曾竭力加强这个据点的驻军。但是，仍不断遭到失败。在游击队两次伏击中，葡萄牙殖民军十六人被打死，七辆卡车全部被击毁。
    六月十四日，又有一支殖民军部队遭到爱国武装力量伏击，一队葡萄牙空军前往援助，其中一架美制战斗轰炸机被击落。
    在爱国武装力量连续进攻十二天以后，葡萄牙殖民主义者为了避免守军全部被歼，在空军掩护下狼狈地撤出贝利据点。
    公报指出，六月份，爱国武装力量还在布伊地区采取了其他许多重大行动。
    六月十九日，游击战士在一次袭击中摧毁了目前在整个布伊地区唯一的葡萄牙据点——马迪纳据点内的发电站，并使其它设施遭到重大破坏。
    六月十七日，正当这个据点的葡萄牙守军集合的时候，游击队用迫击炮突然袭击，使敌军遭到重大伤亡。
    同月十日、十一日和十三日，爱国武装力量对同一据点采取的三次突击行动中，打死敌军八名。
      “葡属”几内亚爱国武装力量六月三十日还在达喀尔发表一项公报，宣布一九六七年的战绩。
    据公报说，一九六七年内，爱国武装力量歼灭葡萄牙殖民军官兵一千九百零五人，消灭驻在“葡属”几内亚的葡萄牙军用飞机中的百分之四十和卡车一百一十六辆，击沉葡军舰艇二十七艘，还缴获大量军火。
