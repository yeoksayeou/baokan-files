In the stormy waves of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the revolutionary masses of our factory, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, seized power from the capitalist roaders within the factory and established a revolutionary committee. However, a handful of class enemies, unwilling to admit defeat, used every conceivable trick to try to overthrow the newly established revolutionary committee. They spread rumors among the masses, undermined the authority of the revolutionary committee, and tried to drive a wedge between the masses and the revolutionary committee.

Great Leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "The rights gained by the people must not be easily relinquished; they must be defended with struggle." Faced with the class enemies' rampant sabotage activities, we revolutionary masses are determined to defend the revolutionary committee with struggle. The more the class enemies direct their spears at the newly established revolutionary committee, the more actively we in the sulfuric acid nickel group study and apply Chairman Mao's thoughts, carry out deep and thorough criticism and repudiation of the counter-revolutionary crimes of the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents. We also hold discussions, write big-character posters, and expose the class enemies' plots to oppose the revolutionary committee.

When one of their schemes fails, the class enemies come up with another. They secretly incite some of the masses to leave their production posts, attempting to sabotage production and bring down the revolutionary committee. We see through their sabotage activities and keep them in mind. At this time, the leaders of the factory revolutionary committee came to our group, organizing us to seriously study Chairman Mao's teachings on class and class struggle, as well as his great teachings on "grasp revolution, promote production." This made us deeply realize that the enemy is trying to sabotage production to bring down the revolutionary committee, which is their desperate struggle to save themselves from doom. Therefore, whether our production can be promoted is not just a matter of production struggle, but a serious class struggle. On one hand, we study Chairman Mao's works more diligently, carry out deep and thorough criticism and repudiation, continuously raise the awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines among all members of the group, and patiently and meticulously do ideological work among the workers who temporarily left their production posts, guiding them back to their production posts. On the other hand, with an unyielding spirit, we overcome all obstacles set by the class enemies, firmly guard our production posts, treat production as a political battle, and defend Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line with actual actions, defending the newly established revolutionary committee. All members of the group display a brave fighting spirit, always adhering to "grasp revolution, promote production." The more intense the struggle, the more united the group becomes. No one is late or leaves early. Everyone, regardless of their post or shift, works together closely. Wherever there is a need, we go; whenever there is a need, we go. Due to the shortage of manpower, the steam post temporarily had no one in charge. To prevent leakage, the steam could not be turned on fully. Some old workers used their lunch breaks to guard the steam tank, turning up the steam and speeding up production.

Great Leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "The people have limitless creative power." Under the leadership of the factory revolutionary committee, we also worked together with other workshops to overcome the obstacles to production set by the capitalist roaders, making the production situation better and better. In the past, due to the constraints of technical "authorities," some technical problems that could be solved were not solved. Now, under the leadership of the revolutionary committee, we have the confidence and ability to solve these technical problems; and we clearly know that solving these technical problems is also a powerful blow to the enemy. For example, the nickel products had a high iron content, affecting the users' use. Thus, the old workers and the group members displayed a daring and pioneering revolutionary spirit, carried out technological innovations. In the experiment process, we broke through the frameworks, added experimental procedures, overcame numerous difficulties, and finally improved the product quality, meeting the users' needs. This victory once again shattered the class enemies' plot to sabotage production and bring down the revolutionary committee.

Through such sharp struggles, we further realized: the enemy will always use various treacherous means to sabotage the newly established revolutionary committee. Therefore, we must maintain a high level of revolutionary vigilance, timely expose their plots, and counterattack them head-on. In the future, we will definitely hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, comprehensively implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and defend the newly established revolutionary committee with struggle.

    用战斗来保卫新生的革命委员会
    沈阳冶炼厂学习毛泽东思想先进集体　硫酸镍小组
    在无产阶级文化大革命运动的暴风雨中，我厂无产阶级革命派，在毛主席革命路线指引下，夺了厂内走资派的权，成立了革命委员会。但是，一小撮阶级敌人不甘心失败，他们使尽一切阴谋手段，妄图颠覆新生的革命委员会。他们竭力在群众中散布谣言，破坏革命委员会的威信，离间群众同革命委员会的血肉联系。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“人民得到的权利，绝不允许轻易丧失，必须用战斗来保卫。”面对阶级敌人的猖狂破坏活动，我们无产阶级革命派决心用战斗保卫革命委员会。阶级敌人越是把矛头对准新生的革命委员会，我们小组工人越是积极活学活用毛泽东思想，深入开展革命大批判，口诛笔伐中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人的反革命罪行。我们还开座谈会，写大字报，揭露阶级敌人反对革命委员会的阴谋活动。
    阶级敌人一计不成，又生一计。他们又在暗地里挑动一部分群众脱离生产岗位，企图通过破坏生产搞垮革命委员会。对敌人的这种破坏活动，我们看在眼里，记在心上。这时，厂革命委员会领导成员来到我们小组，组织大家认真学习毛主席关于阶级和阶级斗争以及“抓革命，促生产”的伟大教导，使我们深刻地认识到，敌人企图用破坏生产来搞垮革命委员会，这是他们为了挽救自己灭亡的命运所作的拚死挣扎。所以，我们的生产能不能促上去，不仅是生产斗争问题，而且是一场严峻的阶级斗争。我们一方面更加努力学习毛主席著作，深入开展革命大批判，不断提高全组同志的阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟，耐心细致地做好一时离开生产岗位的工人同志的思想工作，使他们回到生产岗位上来；另一方面，以一往无前的精神，压倒一切阶级敌人的气概，坚守生产岗位，把生产仗当政治仗打，用实际行动捍卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，保卫新生的革命委员会。全组同志发扬勇敢战斗的精神，一直坚持“抓革命，促生产”。斗争越艰苦越激烈，小组同志团结得越紧，没有一个人迟到早退。大家不分岗位，不分班组，不固定时间，密切协作。那里需要就到那里干，什么时候需要就什么时候到。由于人手少，蒸气岗位一时没有专人负责。为了防止跑液，蒸气不能开大，有的老工人就利用吃饭的时间守在蒸气罐旁，把蒸气开大，加快生产进度。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“人民群众有无限的创造力。”在厂革命委员会的领导下，我们还和兄弟车间一起艰苦奋斗，克服了走资派给生产设置的层层障碍，使生产形势越来越好。过去，在生产上由于受技术“权威”的束缚，一些能解决的技术问题却一直没有解决。现在我们在革命委员会领导下，有信心也有能力解决这些技术问题；而且我们清楚知道，解决这些技术问题，也是对敌人的有力打击。比如镍产品质量含铁量比较高，影响用户的使用。于是，老工人和小组的同志们发扬敢想敢干的革命精神，大搞技术革新。在试验过程中，我们打破框框，增加试验工序，克服了重重困难，终于提高了产品质量，满足了用户需要。这一胜仗，再一次粉碎了阶级敌人妄想通过破坏生产搞垮革命委员会的阴谋。
    经过这样一场又一场的尖锐斗争，我们进一步体会到：敌人总是要采用各种阴险手段破坏新生的革命委员会的。因此，我们一定要保持高度的革命警惕性，及时识破他们的阴谋，针锋相对，给以迎头痛击。今后，我们一定要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，全面落实毛主席的最新指示，用战斗保卫新生的革命委员会。
