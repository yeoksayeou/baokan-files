Chairman Mao teaches us: "If socialism does not occupy the rural areas, capitalism will inevitably occupy them." "One of the important tasks on the ideological front now is to carry out a criticism of revisionism." However, the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents are madly opposing our great leader Chairman Mao and the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. They are spreading their black claws everywhere, peddling the rotten goods of material incentives and piecework, attempting to let revisionism occupy the rural areas and to restore capitalism in the countryside. We must respond to the call of our great leader Chairman Mao and carry out a sustained and fierce criticism of the revisionist line of the Chinese Khrushchev.

The poor and lower-middle peasants of Hongshimen are loyal to our great leader Chairman Mao with a heart full of "loyalty" and grasp the great Mao Zedong Thought with a firm "use." In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and in the days of transforming the world, Chairman Mao's treasure never leaves our hands. The songs of Chairman Mao's sayings never leave our lips. Chairman Mao's words are always in our minds. To ensure that Chairman Mao's voice can be heard everywhere in Hongshimen and that his sayings can be read everywhere, so that the radiant Mao Zedong Thought can shine over Hongshimen, we have mined a batch of blue stones from the Great Wall Ridge to make Chairman Mao's saying boards. The militia company commander Wang Yuhé is at the forefront, and he and the militiamen have decided to use their early morning and evening rest time to carry the blue stones down from the mountain. One early morning, he and the militiamen went to the Great Wall Ridge to carry the stone boards. He first picked up a blue stone board weighing over two hundred pounds and carried it down from the steep Great Wall Ridge, which is several hundred meters high. The mountain is high, the stone is heavy, it is dark, and there is no path. Wang Yuhé grabbed the small trees on the mountain and moved down step by step. After not going far, he was so tired that his whole body was covered in sweat and he could not move his legs. He stopped and silently recited, "Resolve to fight, fear no sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory." Thinking of the radiant Chairman Mao's saying boards that would soon be erected, it was as if our great leader Chairman Mao was by his side. Suddenly, a bright red sun rose in his heart, giving him boundless strength. He stood up and walked forward step by step with great perseverance, finally carrying the stone board back from six miles away. In this way, more than forty blue stone boards were carried back from the Great Wall Ridge to Hongshimen in just two early mornings. Not long after, the bright red Chairman Mao's saying boards stood tall by the mountain road, on the terraced fields like Dazhai, and in the hearts of us poor and lower-middle peasants, illuminating our hearts that are limitlessly loyal to our great leader Chairman Mao.

Wang Yuhé and the militiamen have done countless voluntary labors for the revolution and for the collective. They learn from Zhang Side, serving the people wholeheartedly, and from Norman Bethune, putting others before themselves. They dedicate themselves to the collective and do not care about personal gains. We poor and lower-middle peasants must learn from and apply Mao Zedong Thought in this way, using practical actions to fiercely criticize the Chinese Khrushchev's revisionist fallacies of "material incentives" and "piecework."

    毛主席的宝书不离手  毛主席的话儿记心头
    訾淑文
    毛主席教导我们说：“对于农村的阵地，社会主义如果不去占领，资本主义就必然会去占领。”“我们现在思想战线上的一个重要任务，就是要开展对于修正主义的批判。”可是，中国赫鲁晓夫和他的代理人，却疯狂地反对伟大领袖毛主席和战无不胜的毛泽东思想。他们到处伸出两只黑爪子，贩卖物质刺激、工分挂帅的破烂黑货，妄图叫修正主义去占领农村阵地，叫资本主义在农村复辟。我们一定要响应伟大领袖毛主席的号召，对中国赫鲁晓夫的修正主义路线，进行持久的猛烈的批判。
    我们红石门的贫下中农，对我们伟大领袖毛主席胸怀一个“忠”字，对伟大的毛泽东思想狠抓一个“用”字。在无产阶级文化大革命运动中，在改天换地的战斗日子里，毛主席的宝书，我们不离手。毛主席的语录歌，我们不离口。毛主席的话儿，我们记心头。为了在红石门到处都能听到毛主席的声音，都能读到毛主席语录，让光芒四射的毛泽东思想普照红石门，我们在长城岭上开采了一批青石板，用来做毛主席语录牌。民兵连长王玉合干在前头，他和民兵们决心利用早晚休息时间把青石板从山上背下来。一天清早，他和民兵们去长城岭上背石板。他首先挑了一块有二百多斤重的青石板，背着从几百米高的陡峭的长城岭上往下走。山高，石重，天黑，没有路，王玉合抓着山上的小树，一步一步往下挪。走不多远，累得浑身是汗，迈不开步了。他停下来，默默地背诵“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”他想着即将树立起的光芒四射的毛主席语录牌，好象伟大领袖毛主席就在他身边，顿时心中升起了一轮光芒万丈的红太阳，使他增添了无穷的力量。他站起来，顽强地一步一步地向前走，终于把这块青石板从六里外背了回来。就是这样，四十多块青石板，只花了两个清早的时间，就被他们从长城岭上背回了红石门。不久以后，通红通红的毛主席语录牌，就屹立在沿山公路旁，屹立在大寨式的梯田上，屹立在我们贫下中农的心坎上，照耀着我们贫下中农无限忠于伟大领袖毛主席的颗颗红心。
    王玉合和民兵们，为革命，为集体，不知搞了多少次义务劳动。他们学习张思德，完全彻底为人民服务，学习白求恩，毫不利己专门利人。他们一心扑在集体上，毫不计较个人报酬。我们贫下中农就是要这样活学活用毛泽东思想，用实际行动狠批中国赫鲁晓夫“物质刺激”、“工分挂帅”等反革命修正主义谬论。
