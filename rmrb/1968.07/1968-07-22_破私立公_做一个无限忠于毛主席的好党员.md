What constitutes a good Communist Party member? This is an important issue in the struggle between the two lines in the Party's construction. In his poisonous weed, "Be a Good Party Member, Build a Good Party," China's Khrushchev proposed three standards for a "good party member," which are three poisons to corrupt the souls of Party members. The so-called three standards for a "good party member" are: first, to have Party members "cherish every Party matter as if it were their own," vigorously promoting the "self-centered" view of "private interests"; second, to have Party members carefully calculate how to "suffer" and "sacrifice" to be "most worthwhile," peddling the bourgeois business philosophy of "suffering a little to gain a lot"; third, he demands that Party members play political tricks, "changing with the situation a thousand times," to maintain the "Party member" label "for life." The "good party member" that China's Khrushchev wants to cultivate is the most typical bourgeois egoist, hypocrite, and two-faced person. China's Khrushchev proposed these three standards precisely to use the bourgeois worldview to transform the Party, attempting to turn the proletarian Party into a tool for him to carry out his counter-revolutionary revisionist line.

Under the nurturing of Mao Zedong Thought, countless Communist Party members wholeheartedly engage in revolution, constantly struggle against private interests, and take the spirit of "selflessness" taught by Chairman Mao as their guideline, striving to be good Party members who are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao.

Below are several short articles by revolutionary soldiers from a certain unit of the Railway Corps criticizing China's Khrushchev's reactionary fallacies of the three standards for a "good party member."

Selflessly Devoted to the Public: Bravely Sacrifice for the Public

China's Khrushchev vigorously advocates "wholeheartedly for the Party and humanity's liberation" and "sacrificing and struggling," all to gain the trust and respect of the masses. This is the best portrayal of his bourgeois egoist face.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Chinese Communists, starting from the greatest interests of the broadest masses of the Chinese people, ... are willing to sacrifice everything personal and are ready at any time to give their lives for our cause."

We are soldiers of the Railway Corps, working tirelessly for socialist construction year after year, opening tunnels in the mountains and building bridges over rivers. Often, after bidding farewell to one mountain, we climb another peak; after overcoming the severe cold of the north, we fight the scorching heat of the south. With our hardworking hands, we open tunnels on the beautiful rivers and mountains of our motherland, build bridges, and construct railways. We have never thought that after contributing a little, we should gain the trust and respect of the masses. The needs of the Party are our will, and wherever Chairman Mao points, that is our battlefield.

With "private interests" as the goal and motive, to gain the trust and respect of the masses, it is impossible to have the spirit of fearlessness in revolution, let alone sacrifice for the revolution. The result will inevitably be despised by the masses. Only with "public interests" as the goal and motive can one wholeheartedly serve the collective and the people. In normal times, one is willing to selflessly serve the public, and in critical moments, one can bravely sacrifice for the public. To be a good Party member who is infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, one must make one's soul a world of "public interests," without a speck of "private interests"!

Suffer for the Revolution: The More Suffering, the More Glorious

China's Khrushchev advocates "suffering first, enjoying later," which is consistent with his thought of "suffering a little to gain a lot," using "suffering" to exchange for "enjoyment." This is a thorough bourgeois egoist worldview.

Why do Communist Party members have to suffer hardships, bear heavy burdens, and set an example in everything? The lifelong mission of Communists is to realize communism, to struggle against nature, against the earth, and against people. Chairman Mao teaches us: "What is work? Work is struggle. Where there are difficulties and problems, we need to go and solve them. We work and struggle to solve difficulties." We soldiers of the Railway Corps have lived in mountain valleys for many years, struggling with rocks. The work is extremely arduous. But whenever we think of the railways we build, which are the "public interest" roads to communism, and are for the happiness of all the people of China and the world, we feel that suffering for the revolution is glorious, the more suffering, the more glorious. No matter how hard it is, we do not feel tired.

Once, the unit was repairing a road. One night, a wooden air box needed to be made urgently. However, the carpentry tools were still in the camp, more than forty miles away from the repair site. The mountains were high and the roads were dangerous. Going on the mission had great difficulties and dangers. I thought of Chairman Mao's teaching, "The more difficult the place, the more we should go," and repeatedly requested to set out. The dark night, the road was treacherous and slippery, but in my heart, there was a red sun, shining brightly all around. The eighty-pound toolbox became lighter and lighter, and by dawn, I overcame all kinds of difficulties and returned to the site, making the air box in time. I saw that I had created good working conditions for my comrades, and my heart was filled with joy. We proletarian revolutionary soldiers, the more we contribute to the revolution, the greater our happiness; the more we suffer, the sweeter it is for the Chinese people and the people of the world.

Let China's Khrushchev's petty bourgeois philosophy go to hell!

Eager to Work Hard: No Personal Gain

China's Khrushchev often advocates that Communist Party members "work hard with their heads down," and in the future, they can "stand out" and "develop themselves." He wants us to bury our heads in "private interests" all day, pursue fame and wealth, and enjoy life, thus unknowingly "peacefully evolve" into revisionists.

Chairman Mao teaches us that Communist Party members should "work hard and not seek personal gain," and "wholeheartedly serve the people." For three years since joining the army, I have followed Chairman Mao's teachings, tempering my mind of serving the public in ordinary positions, and have been a carpenter, stonemason, air gunner, and blaster. Whatever the Party asks me to do, I love to do. The more difficult the place, the more I want to go; the heavier the burden, the more I want to bear. In the practice of struggle, I deeply feel that without ordinary bricks and tiles, one cannot build the great edifice of communism.

To be a good Party member who is infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, one must not seek personal gain, work hard with one's head down, and combine political foresight with practical spirit well. One should not be shortsighted for "developing oneself" nor seek fame for "standing out." One should regard one's ordinary work as a part of the great cause of communism. I am determined to: completely and thoroughly serve the people, be a paving stone that never decays for life, a sleeper that never rots, a spike that never rusts, and let the train to communism fly forward without stopping on me.

Everything Starts from the Interests of the People

China's Khrushchev, starting from the class interests of the bourgeoisie, advocates that Party members should "cherish every matter of the Party as if it were their own." This is clearly starting from private interests, loving the public as a standard for loving private interests.

Chairman Mao teaches us that "everything starts from the interests of the people," pointing out the principle for Party members to handle matters.

When a Communist Party member handles every piece of work, the first thing they think about is the overall interests of the Party or their personal partial interests, reflecting the struggle between public and private. In complex construction, companies often have disagreements over cooperation. Our company has been rated as a "Four Good Company" for three consecutive years, but due to poor cooperation, brother companies have complaints. At first, we simply started from maintaining the honor of the "Four Good Company" to deal with the cooperation issue. The result was that we did not get away from "me" and "honor." The starting point was wrong, so the effect was not good. Later, we followed Chairman Mao's teachings, "everything starts from the interests of the people, not from the interests of individuals or small groups," and "our responsibility is to be responsible to the people." We launched a discussion on who we are building the road for and how to treat honor. Through the discussion, everyone realized: The task given to us by Chairman Mao, every shovel and pickaxe used to build the road, is for a common goal, is to implement Chairman Mao's great strategic thought, is to fight bravely to consolidate national defense and support world revolution. A Communist Party member should dedicate their loyalty in implementing Chairman Mao's great strategic thought, establish great public interests, break great private interests, and actively improve cooperation. The starting point was corrected, so the direction was also corrected. Everyone stood at the entrance of the tunnel, with their hearts for the motherland and their eyes on the world, wholeheartedly fighting together to implement Chairman Mao's great strategic thought. This made us deeply realize that two fundamentally opposed worldviews, handling matters with two fundamentally opposed starting points, will inevitably produce two completely different results. Communist Party members can only start from great public interests, link all our work with the great goal of communism, have the political soul of the proletariat, and grasp the firm and correct political direction.

		Platoon Leader, Zhou Yuangjin

Vow to Be a Brick and Tile of the Great Edifice of Communism

China's Khrushchev's fallacy of "unity of public and private interests" is completely for private interests. He puts on a preaching face and says nonsense like: "Strive for the development, success, and victory of the Party's cause," which can "develop oneself and improve oneself." Look! He never forgets his own development.

"Communist Party members should never put personal interests first, but should subordinate personal interests to the interests of the nation and the people." We soldiers of the Railway Corps remember Chairman Mao's teachings and, under any difficult conditions and in any harsh situations, wholeheartedly serve the people and consciously bear the revolutionary burden towards communism.

I am a young intellectual who enlisted in 1965, coming from a bustling city to a remote mountain; from holding a pen to wielding a large hammer. What I think of is not "developing myself," but wholeheartedly serving the people and cultivating myself into a successor of the proletarian revolutionary cause. Over the years, through the practice of struggle, I have deeply felt that: young intellectuals must thoroughly change their worldview and become communists, and must constantly struggle against "private interests." If one only wants to do a "spectacular" cause to "develop oneself and improve oneself," and does not want to do the ordinary revolutionary work, this is the manifestation of "private interests." Only by consciously throwing oneself into the fiery struggle, wholeheartedly serving the cause of communism, is it the highest ideal of a revolutionary soldier. Being a brick at the bottom layer of a thousand-layer building, people may not see it, but it is the solid foundation of the thousand-layer building. Such work is the more ordinary, the more meaningful; such an environment is the more arduous, the more happy one feels.

Communist Party members and revolutionary soldiers armed with Mao Zedong Thought have the reddest hearts and the brightest eyes. China's Khrushchev wants to lead us astray, which is a futile attempt! We are determined to be infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, fiercely struggle against "private interests," establish "public interests," and wholeheartedly serve the people of China and the world. In the surging revolutionary torrent, we will wash away the "unity of public and private interests" advocated by China's Khrushchev, and strive to be Communist Party members armed with Mao Zedong Thought.

### 破私立公　做一个无限忠于毛主席的好党员

    破私立公　做一个无限忠于毛主席的好党员
    怎样才算得一个共产党员？是党的建设方面两条路线斗争的一个重要问题。中国赫鲁晓夫在《作一个好的党员，建设一个好的党》这株大毒草中，提出来的“好党员”的三条标准，是腐蚀党员灵魂的三服毒药。所谓“好党员”的三条标准，其一要党员“爱护党的每一个事物，如自己的事物一样”，拚命鼓吹一切“以我为中心”的“私”字观；其二要党员仔细打好怎样“吃苦”、“牺牲”才算“最值得”的小算盘，向我们兜售“吃点小亏，占大便宜”的资产阶级生意经；其三他要求党员玩弄政治权术，“根据情况的不同而千变万化”，以保持“党员”的招牌“终身不变”。中国赫鲁晓夫所要培养的这种“好党员”，是最典型的资产阶级利己主义者、伪君子、两面派。中国赫鲁晓夫提出这三条标准，就是要用资产阶级的世界观来改造党，妄图把无产阶级的党变成他推行反革命修正主义路线的工具。
    在毛泽东思想哺育下的成千成万的共产党员，一心一意干革命，时时事事斗私心，以毛主席教导的“大公无私”的精神作为准则，努力做一个无限忠于毛主席的好党员。
    下面是铁道兵某部革命战士痛斥中国赫鲁晓夫所谓“好党员”三条标准的反动谬论的几篇短文。
    乐于忘我为公　勇于献身为公
    中国赫鲁晓夫拚命宣扬“一心一意为了党与人类解放”而“牺牲奋斗”，是为了得到群众的“信任”和
  “尊敬”，这是他资产阶级利己主义者面目的最好写照。
    毛主席教导我们：“以中国最广大人民的最大利益为出发点的中国共产党人，……不惜牺牲自己个人的一切，随时准备拿出自己的生命去殉我们的事业。”
    我们是铁道兵战士，成年累月为社会主义建设辛勤劳动，逢山开洞，遇水架桥，往往是辞别了这座高山，再登上另一座峻岭；刚战胜了北国严寒，又奋战南方盛暑，用我们勤劳的双手，在祖国的锦绣河山上开出一条条隧道，架起一座座桥梁，筑成一条条铁路。我们从来没有想到出了一点力就应当博得群众的“信任”和“尊敬”。党的需要就是我们的志愿，毛主席指向的地方就是我们战斗的阵地。
    以“私”字为目的，以“私”字为动力，去博得群众“信任”和“尊敬”，决不可能有大无畏的革命精神，更不可能为革命献身。其结果必然被群众所唾弃。只有以“公”字为目的，以“公”字为动力，才能一心一意为集体，全心全意为人民。平时乐于忘我为公，关键时刻才能勇于献身为公。要做一个无限忠于毛主席的好党员，必须让自己的灵魂成为一个“公”字世界，而决不能掺杂一点“私”字的灰尘！
                                排长　周德昌
    为革命吃苦　越苦越光荣
    中国赫鲁晓夫鼓吹“吃苦在前，享福在后”，是同他的“吃小亏，占大便宜”的思想一致的，就是以“吃苦”换取“享福”。这是彻头彻尾的利己主义世界观。
    共产党员为什么要去吃大苦，挑重担，处处以身作则呢？共产党人的终身事业就是要实现共产主义，要与天斗争，与地斗争，与人斗争。毛主席教导我们：“什么叫工作，工作就是斗争。那些地方有困难、有问题，需要我们去解决。我们是为着解决困难去工作、去斗争的。”我们铁道兵战士长年以山沟为家，同岩石搏斗，工作非常艰苦。但是，每当想到我们修筑的条条铁道，是通往共产主义的“公”字路，都是为全中国人民和全世界人民谋求幸福的路，就感到为革命吃苦，越苦越光荣，越苦越幸福。再苦也不觉得苦，再累也不感到累。
    有一次，部队抢修一条公路。一天晚上，需要赶制一个木风箱。可是，木工工具还在离抢修工地四十多里的驻地。山高路险，去执行任务，有很大困难和危险。我想起毛主席“越是困难的地方越是要去”的教导，就再三请求出发了。漆黑的夜，道路又险又滑，可是我的心里有一轮红太阳，照得前后左右亮堂堂，八十多斤重的工具箱越扛越轻，天亮时，终于克服种种困难，赶回了工地，及时地赶制好了风箱。我看到自己为同志们创造了良好的工作条件，心里乐滋滋的。我们无产阶级革命战士为革命多贡献一分力量，就是最大的幸福；自己多吃一分苦，就是为中国人民和世界人民多争一分甜。
    让中国赫鲁晓夫的市侩哲学见鬼去吧！
                              副排长　刘金发
      积极肯干　不谋私利
    中国赫鲁晓夫经常鼓吹，共产党员“埋头苦干”，将来可以“出风头”，“发展自己”。他要我们成天埋头于“私”字之中，追名逐利，贪图享受，从而不知不觉地“和平演变”成修正主义分子。
    毛主席教导我们，共产党员要“积极肯干，不谋私利”，“全心全意地为人民服务”。入伍三年来，我遵循毛主席的教导，在平凡的岗位上磨练一心为公的思想，先后当过木工、石工、风枪手、爆破手，党叫干哪一行，我就爱哪一行。越是艰苦的地方越要去，越是沉重的担子越要挑。在斗争的实践中，我深深体会到：没有普通的一砖一瓦，不能建成共产主义的大厦。
    做一个无限忠于毛主席的好党员，必须不谋私利，埋头苦干，把政治远见和实干精神很好结合起来。不为“发展自己”而鼠目寸光，也不为“出风头”而哗众取宠。把个人平凡的工作，当作整个共产主义伟大事业的一部分。我决心做到：完全彻底为人民服务，做一辈子永不风化的铺路石子，当一根永不腐烂的铺路枕木，做一颗永不生锈的道钉，让通向共产主义的列车，从我身上永不停息地飞驶前进。
                                  战士　胡大明
        一切从人民的利益出发
    中国赫鲁晓夫从资产阶级的阶级利益出发，鼓吹党员要“爱护党的每一个事物，如自己的事物一样”。这明明是以私为出发点，爱公是以爱私为标准。
    毛主席教导我们的“一切从人民的利益出发”，指出了共产党员处事的准则。
    共产党员处理每一件工作，首先想到的是党的整体的利益，还是个人的局部的利益，反映了公和私的斗争。在复杂的施工中，连和连之间常常在协作问题上发生分歧。我们连曾连续三年被评为四好连队，由于协作不好，兄弟连队有意见。开始，我们单纯从保持四好连队的荣誉出发，来对待协作问题。结果，没有离开“我”和“荣誉”。出发点偏了，效果也就不好。后来，我们遵照毛主席“一切从人民的利益出发，而不是从个人或小集团的利益出发”，“我们的责任，是向人民负责”的教导，展开了为谁修路和如何对待荣誉的大讨论。通过讨论，大家认识到：毛主席给我们的任务，一锹一镐的修路都是为了一个共同的目标，都是为了贯彻执行毛主席的伟大战略思想，都是为巩固国防、支援世界革命而英勇战斗。一个共产党员，应该在贯彻执行毛主席的伟大战略思想中献忠心，立大公，破大私，主动搞好协作关系。出发点端正了，方向也就端正了，大家站在隧道口，胸怀祖国，放眼世界，一心一意为贯彻毛主席的伟大战略思想而共同战斗。这使我们深刻地体会到：两种根本对立的世界观，处事有两种根本对立的出发点，也必然出现两种截然不同的结果。共产党员只有以大公为出发点，把我们的一切工作和共产主义的远大目标联系在一起，才有无产阶级的政治灵魂，才能把握住坚定正确的政治方向。
                                  连长　周元金
  誓做建设共产主义大厦的一砖一瓦
    中国赫鲁晓夫所谓“公私一致性”的谬论，完全是为了私。他摆出一副说教的面孔，胡说什么：“争取党的事业的发展、成功和胜利”，就能“发展自己，提高自己”。你瞧！他念念不忘的是自己的发展。
      “共产党员无论何时何地都不应以个人利益放在第一位，而应以个人利益服从于民族的和人民群众的利益”。我们铁道兵战士牢记毛主席的教导，无论在什么困难的条件下，在什么艰苦的场合，都全心全意为人民服务，自觉地把革命重担挑向共产主义。
    我是一个知识青年，一九六五年应征入伍，从繁华的城市来到了偏僻的深山；从手握笔杆到手抡大锤。想到的不是为了“发展自己”，而是全心全意为人民服务，培养自己成为无产阶级革命事业的接班人。几年来，通过斗争的实践，我深深体会到：知识青年要彻底改造自己的世界观，成为一个共产主义者，必须不断地和“私”字作斗争，如果只想干一场“轰轰烈烈”的事业，来“发展自己，提高自己”，而不愿踏踏实实地做平凡的革命工作，这正是“私”字的表现。只有自觉投身到火热的斗争中去，全心全意为共产主义事业服务，才是革命战士最高尚的理想。作千层大厦最底层的一块砖，人们虽然看不见，但它却是千层大厦的坚实根基。这样的工作，越平凡越有意义；这样的环境，越艰苦越感到幸福。
    用毛泽东思想武装起来的共产党员、革命战士，心最红，眼最亮。中国赫鲁晓夫想把我们引向歧途，是痴心妄想！我们决心无限忠于毛主席，狠斗“私”字，大立“公”字，全心全意地为中国人民和全世界人民服务，在风雷激荡的革命洪流中，把中国赫鲁晓夫所宣扬的“公私一致性”冲刷得干干净净，争取做一个用毛泽东思想武装起来的共产党员。
