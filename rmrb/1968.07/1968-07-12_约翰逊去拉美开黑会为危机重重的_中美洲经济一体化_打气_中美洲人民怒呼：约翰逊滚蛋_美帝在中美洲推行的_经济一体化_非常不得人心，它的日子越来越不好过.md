Johnson, the head of U.S. imperialism, recently personally went to San Salvador, the capital of El Salvador, to participate in the "Central American Presidential Conference." He attempted to boost the "Central American Economic Integration," which is already in deep crisis, in order to further control, plunder, and enslave the people of Central American countries.

The "Central American Economic Integration" and the "Common Market" established in Central America by U.S. imperialism over the years are actually its colonialist plans to further plunder and enslave Central American countries. According to this plan, U.S. goods that dominate the imports of Central American countries and products from U.S. monopolies that set up factories in Central America can enjoy unimpeded convenience in these countries. This allows U.S. goods and capital to continuously flow into Central American countries, ruthlessly plundering these countries.

Statistics show that the import volume of the five Central American countries was $481 million in 1960, increasing to $942 million by 1966. Eighty percent of the trade of the five Central American countries is conducted with the United States. Foreign investment in Central America last year increased from the usual $20 million to $60 million, with the majority being U.S. capital.

The flooding of U.S. goods in Central America and the accelerated infiltration of U.S. capital have greatly hindered the industrial development of Central American countries. Statistics show that the industrial output value of Central America was 12% of the national GDP in 1950, 13% in 1963, and remains at this level today.

Meanwhile, the United States continues to implement a price-cutting policy on agricultural products exported from Central America to the international market, causing these countries to experience a trade deficit almost every year for many years, with a significant increase in the deficit. According to U.S. publications, the trade deficit of the five Central American countries was $45.1 million in 1961, rising to $242 million by 1967. The cumulative total deficit from 1961 to 1967 was $891.1 million.

Despite U.S. imperialism's extensive propaganda about the "economic development" and "prosperity" brought by "Central American Economic Integration," and its attempt to promote it to South America, this new colonialist plan has been increasingly exposed and strongly opposed by the broad masses of the people in Central America.

During Johnson's participation in this conference and his activities afterward, mass anti-U.S. demonstrations erupted in El Salvador, Nicaragua, and Guatemala in Central America. On the first day of the conference, demonstrators in El Salvador shouted, "Yankees go home!" "Johnson get out!" On the day Johnson arrived, demonstrators broke through the strict security of the reactionary military police and U.S.-sent special agents, pelting Johnson with paint bottles, eggs, and tomatoes. In Nicaragua, university students, despite the brutal suppression by the reactionary authorities, declared the day of Johnson's arrival as the "Day of National Humiliation" and occupied a building to protest against Johnson. They clearly pointed out that the "Central American Common Market" is a tool of U.S. imperialist aggression. Some patriots in Nicaragua also wrote slogans on walls condemning Johnson.

These events fully demonstrate that the "economic integration" pushed by U.S. imperialism in Central America is extremely unpopular, and its days are numbered.

    约翰逊去拉美开黑会为危机重重的“中美洲经济一体化”打气
    中美洲人民怒呼：约翰逊滚蛋
    美帝在中美洲推行的“经济一体化”非常不得人心，它的日子越来越不好过
    新华社十日讯　美帝国主义头子约翰逊最近亲自出马到萨尔瓦多首都圣萨尔瓦多参加“中美洲总统会议”，妄图给已经陷于重重危机的“中美洲经济一体化”打气，以便进一步控制、掠夺和奴役中美洲国家的人民。
    美帝国主义多年来推行的“中美洲经济一体化”和在中美洲建立的“共同市场”，实际上就是它变本加厉地掠夺和奴役中美洲国家的殖民主义计划。根据这个计划，在中美洲国家进口中占统治地位的美国商品和在中美洲设厂的美国垄断企业的产品，可以在中美洲各国取得畅通无阻的便利，从而使美国商品和美国资本源源不断地流入中美洲国家，对这些国家进行残酷的掠夺。
    据统计，中美洲五国的进口额一九六○年为四亿八千一百万美元，到一九六六年就增加到九亿四千二百万美元，而中美洲五国的贸易百分之八十是同美国进行的。外国对中美洲的投资，去年已由通常的两千万美元增加到六千万美元，其中主要是美国资本。
    美国商品在中美洲泛滥成灾和美国资本加速渗入，大大地阻碍了中美洲国家的工业发展。据统计，中美洲一九五○年的工业产值占国民生产总值的百分之十二，一九六三年占百分之十三，而目前仍停留在这个水平上。
    与此同时，美国在国际市场上对中美洲出口的农产品继续实行压价政策，使这些国家多年来国际收支几乎年年出现逆差，并且增长幅度很大。据美国报刊透露，一九六一年中美洲五个国家的国际收支逆差为四千五百一十万美元，到一九六七年就上升到了两亿四千二百万美元，从一九六一年到一九六七年七年累积总差额高达八亿九千一百一十万美元。
    尽管美帝国主义大肆吹嘘“中美洲经济一体化”带来了经济“发展”和“繁荣”；并且企图把它向南美推销，但是，这一新殖民主义计划已日益为中美洲广大人民所识破，遭到了他们越来越强烈的反对。
    在美帝国主义头子约翰逊参加这次会议和会后进行活动期间，中美洲的萨尔瓦多、尼加拉瓜和危地马拉相继爆发了人民群众的反美示威。在这次会议的第一天，萨尔瓦多的示威群众高呼：“美国佬滚回去！”“约翰逊滚蛋！”。在约翰逊到达的那天，示威群众突破了反动军警和美国派去的特务人员的森严戒备，用油漆瓶、鸡蛋、西红柿痛击约翰逊。在尼加拉瓜，国立大学的学生不顾反动当局的残暴镇压，宣布约翰逊到达的那天为“国耻日”，并占领一座大楼作为对约翰逊的抗议，他们明确指出，“中美洲共同市场”是美帝国主义的侵略工具。尼加拉瓜有一些爱国者还在墙上涂写谴责约翰逊的标语。
    这些情况充分表明美帝国主义在中美洲推行的“经济一体化”非常不得人心，它的日子越来越不好过。
