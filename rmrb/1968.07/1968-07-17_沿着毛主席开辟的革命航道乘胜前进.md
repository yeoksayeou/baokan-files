	The broad masses of workers, peasants, soldiers, and Red Guards across the country enthusiastically celebrate the second anniversary of Chairman Mao's swim across the Yangtze River.

	They pledge to advance along the revolutionary path blazed by Chairman Mao, to study and apply Mao Zedong Thought in the midst of the stormy waves of class struggle, to further strengthen the study of Mao Zedong Thought, to better integrate theory with practice, to combine learning with application, to ensure that words and deeds are consistent, and to fully implement Chairman Mao's latest directives.

	Xinhua News Agency, July 16 – Today marks the second anniversary of our beloved great leader Chairman Mao's triumphant swim across the Yangtze River. Along the banks of rivers, lakes, and seas across the country, red flags are flying, and songs of praise are echoing. Under the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, the broad masses of revolutionary cadres, revolutionary masses, Red Guards, and People's Liberation Army soldiers and officers, who have advanced victoriously through the stormy waves of class struggle in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution over the past two years, are holding grand celebrations and swimming activities with deep proletarian feelings of loyalty to Chairman Mao. They unanimously declare, "Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! We will forever be loyal to you and advance along the revolutionary path you have blazed. We will definitely take your great revolutionary practice as an example, better study and apply your brilliant thoughts, carry forward the revolutionary learning style you personally advocated, and fully implement your latest directives without any deviation. We will definitely achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution."

	In the capital, Beijing, the broad masses of workers, peasants, and Red Guards held celebrations and swimming activities today at "August 1st" Lake, Kunming Lake, Shichahai, and the Miyun Reservoir in the suburbs. The water was filled with flying red flags, and the swimming teams, with a giant portrait of Chairman Mao leading the way, shouted slogans such as "Long live Chairman Mao!" and "Wish Chairman Mao eternal life!" as they swam forward. The military and civilians of Shanghai held a long-distance swimming week to celebrate the second anniversary of Chairman Mao's swim across the Yangtze River. Today, the military and civilians of Shanghai held a celebration meeting. After the meeting, 500 long-distance swimmers held a commemorative activity, swimming 30 li (about 15 kilometers) along the Yangtze River. Among the participants were more than 100 soldiers and officers from the Shanghai Air Force, who, with deep proletarian feelings of loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, spent eight days and nights embroidering a large portrait of Chairman Mao. Today, they led the way with the embroidered portrait of Chairman Mao, forming a "loyalty" shaped team on the Yangtze River, advancing bravely against the waves. After the celebration meeting held by the Tianjin Revolutionary Committee and the Tianjin Garrison today, more than a thousand workers and peasants braved the rain to swim in the Haihe River.

	The military and civilians of Wuhan today held meetings with special excitement, published articles, and set up big-character posters to commemorate the glorious day when Chairman Mao swam across the Yangtze River in Wuhan. Many swimmers braved the rain to cross the river where Chairman Mao swam two years ago, feeling extremely happy. They shouted over and over again, "Long live Chairman Mao! Eternal life to Chairman Mao!" In Changsha, Hunan, where Chairman Mao studied and engaged in revolutionary activities in his youth, the sky was clear today. The broad masses of workers and peasants gathered by the Xiangjiang River to hold a celebration meeting and sent a message of congratulations to our great leader Chairman Mao. Ten thousand swimmers shouted "Long live Chairman Mao!" and successfully crossed the Xiangjiang River. The broad masses of workers and peasants in Taiyuan held a celebration meeting. The local garrison soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, militiamen, and children performed swimming projects such as "Sunflowers Facing the Sun," water shooting, water rescue, armed swimming, and "water combat." The soldiers and officers of the People's Navy stationed on the coastal front lines also held celebration activities today. On the turbulent sea, the soldiers and officers of a certain fast boat squadron of the East China Fleet and a certain unit on the front line of the South China Sea formed the characters "Loyal to Chairman Mao" and bravely advanced against the waves, fully demonstrating the loyalty of the People's Navy to follow the great leader Chairman Mao to brave the storms and fight the revolution for a lifetime. The soldiers and officers of the Guangzhou Military Region have held various celebration activities in recent days. Today, the soldiers and officers of a certain engineering battalion swam across the Pearl River against the surging waves. In Nanchang, Nanjing, Hangzhou, Jinan, Qingdao, Zhengzhou, Shenyang, Harbin, Lanzhou, and other places, the broad masses of workers and peasants held grand celebration meetings and held swimming activities in the Bohai Sea, Yangtze River, Yellow River, Ganjiang River, West Lake, Songhua River, and other rivers and lakes.

	Chairman Mao teaches us, "Great storms and waves are nothing to fear. Human society has developed through great storms and waves." The swimmers in various places, in today's various commemorative activities, recalled and discussed the decisive victories achieved in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution over the past two years, and said with great emotion that the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao is like the giant waves of the Yangtze River and the surging tides of the sea, which have swept away the bourgeois headquarters within the party led by China's Khrushchev, exposed those anti-communist, anti-people, anti-Mao Zedong Thought counter-revolutionary revisionists, and those traitors, spies, and counter-revolutionary two-faced characters, and smashed their evil plots to overthrow our proletarian dictatorship and restore capitalism. The stormy waves of class struggle have tempered the broad masses of the people, greatly raising their class struggle consciousness and two-line struggle consciousness. They expressed their determination to advance along the revolutionary path blazed by Chairman Mao, to bravely advance in the stormy waves of class struggle, and to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

	The soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army, workers, poor and lower-middle peasants, and Red Guards participating in the celebration activities in Beijing, Shanghai, and other places said excitedly that in the midst of the victorious songs of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, celebrating the second anniversary of Chairman Mao's swim across the Yangtze River, we feel extremely happy. Two years ago today, Chairman Mao broke the waves and swam across the Yangtze River, opening up the path to victory for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution with his great revolutionary practice. Over the past two years, under the guidance of the great leader Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, we have thoroughly smashed the bourgeois headquarters led by China's Khrushchev and achieved decisive victories in our country's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. We are determined to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and forever be revolutionary fighters who are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, infinitely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. We will bravely advance in the stormy waves of class struggle and achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. In the long-distance swimming activity held in Nanjing, the team at the forefront was composed of more than 100 soldiers and officers from the "Linfen Brigade" of the Nanjing Military Region. This heroic unit, which made glorious achievements in the war of liberation that overthrew the Chiang Kai-shek regime, responded to Chairman Mao's great call to "support the broad leftist masses" in the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and established new merits. The soldiers and officers of the "Linfen Brigade" recalled the history of their unit's battles and deeply realized that Chairman Mao's revolutionary line is our lifeline, and following Chairman Mao is victory. The soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army, who made significant contributions to the "Three Supports and Two Military" work in Heilongjiang Province, swam across the Songhua River today with the local revolutionary masses. The soldiers and officers expressed their determination to advance with the broad masses of proletarian revolutionaries, forever following Chairman Mao in the stormy waves, and to contribute all their strength to the "Three Supports and Two Military" work.

	The proletarian revolutionaries, revolutionary masses, and soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army in various places pointed out that as we advance along the revolutionary path blazed by Chairman Mao and achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the most important task before us is to study and apply Mao Zedong Thought in the stormy waves of class struggle, to strengthen the study of Mao Zedong Thought, to carry forward the good learning style of integrating theory with practice advocated by Chairman Mao, and to better integrate learning with application, ensuring that words and deeds are consistent. The proletarian revolutionaries and revolutionary masses of Wuhan who braved the rain to cross the Yangtze River today said that every victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Hubei Province and Wuhan City over the past two years is a great victory of Mao Zedong Thought. We deeply feel from the struggle practice that following Chairman Mao is victory. In the future, we will definitely better study and apply Mao Zedong Thought, fully implement Chairman Mao's latest directives without any deviation, and truly do as Chairman Mao instructs and advance as Chairman Mao directs! The broad masses of military and civilians participating in the celebration activities in the Lanzhou region expressed their determination to carry out the mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought more extensively and deeply, to be loyal to Chairman Mao, to Mao Zedong Thought, and to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line for a lifetime, and to forever follow Chairman Mao in making the revolution. The proletarian revolutionaries in the sports sector in Zhengzhou and the soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Zhengzhou held a get-together, exchanging experiences and lessons learned from studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought in the stormy waves of class struggle. They said that in the past, we responded to Chairman Mao's great battle call, went to the stormy waves of class struggle to temper ourselves, went to rivers, lakes, and seas to swim, improved our ability to fight against class enemies and nature, and tempered a red heart that is all for Chairman Mao. In the future, we must seriously study and apply Mao Zedong Thought, transform our worldview, further achieve ideological revolutionization, and make new achievements in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

	Chairman Mao teaches us, "The successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause are produced in the struggle of the masses and tempered in the great storms of revolution." Over the past two years of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, millions of revolutionary youngsters have followed the great leader Chairman Mao, been tempered in the stormy waves of class struggle, and are growing into reliable successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause. Today, on the glorious day of commemorating the second anniversary of Chairman Mao's swim across the Yangtze River, the Red Guards in various places recalled the past two years of battle and expressed their deep emotions: It is Mao Zedong Thought that nurtured our growth. In the future, we will definitely better read Chairman Mao's books and follow Chairman Mao in making the revolution. Many Red Guards who are about to graduate from colleges and universities in some regions felt particularly excited as they swam in rivers, lakes, and seas today. They expressed their determination to respond to Chairman Mao's great call to go to the stormy waves for tempering, to go to the countryside, to the border, to where the motherland needs us the most, and to the most arduous places. They will walk the path of integrating with workers and peasants and become ordinary laborers.
