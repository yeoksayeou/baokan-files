The Albanian newspaper "People's Voice" published an article on July 13 denouncing and condemning the conspiracy between the US and the USSR to conduct new deals on offensive and defensive missiles. The article pointed out that this is part of the political and military cooperation between the two superpowers.

The article states that Washington and Moscow are using the same tune to promote and fabricate new treaty drafts on offensive and defensive missiles, claiming it as a "new step towards disarmament." However, this widespread propaganda cannot cover up the conspiracies of the Soviet revisionists and the US imperialists.

The article states that whether it is the deceptive "Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons" or the new treaty drafts on missiles being prepared by imperialism and revisionism, they have nothing to do with disarmament. They are completely unrelated to the demands of the peoples of various countries for the complete, thorough prohibition of the use and production of nuclear weapons and the thorough destruction of the existing nuclear stockpiles.

The article emphasizes that the new treaty being plotted by the Kremlin and the White House is part of the comprehensive political and military cooperation between the US and the USSR. This new treaty is another link in the counter-revolutionary conspiracy chain of the US imperialists and Soviet revisionists to crazily oppose the People's Republic of China. At the same time, it is a continuation of the US imperialists and Soviet revisionists' efforts to carry out nuclear blackmail against the peoples of various countries who do not submit to the intentions of imperialism and revisionism and who love freedom and enjoy sovereignty.

The article points out that it is becoming increasingly clear that the Soviet revisionists are sinking deeper into the mire of betrayal. The Soviet revisionist leader Kosygin shamelessly publicly welcomed the so-called "initiative for peace" of the American murderers. The traitorous clique of Brezhnev and Kosygin are creating conditions for the conclusion of a new deceptive treaty between the US and the USSR.

The article states that the revolutionary peoples of various countries have long seen through the tricks of the US and the USSR to dominate the world. They do not harbor illusions about the "peace" of imperialism and revisionism. The conspiracy of the US and the USSR to conclude a new treaty on missiles will absolutely not deceive the peoples of the world.

    阿《人民之声报》谴责美苏在导弹方面进行新交易
    美苏加紧军事勾结疯狂反华
    美帝苏修的新阴谋绝对欺骗不了世界人民
    新华社地拉那十四日电　阿尔巴尼亚《人民之声报》十三日发表文章，揭露和谴责苏美在进攻性的和防御性的导弹方面进行新交易的阴谋，指出这是苏美政治和军事全面合作的一个部分。
    文章说，华盛顿和莫斯科用同一调子鼓吹炮制关于进攻性的和防御性的导弹新条约草案，把它说成是“走向裁军的新步骤”。但是，这一甚嚣尘上的宣传决不能掩盖苏修和美帝的阴谋。
    文章说，无论是骗人的“防止核扩散条约”，还是帝国主义和修正主义正在准备的关于导弹方面的新条约草案，都同裁军毫不相干，同各国人民要求完全、彻底禁止使用和生产核武器以及彻底销毁现在储备的核武器，毫无共同之处。
    文章强调指出，克里姆林宫和白宫正在密谋缔结的这个新条约，是苏美政治和军事全面合作的一个部分。这个新条约是美帝和苏修疯狂反对中华人民共和国的反革命阴谋锁链上的又一个环节。它同时也是美帝和苏修竭力对不屈从于帝国主义和修正主义意旨的、爱好自由和享有主权的各国人民进行核讹诈的继续。
    文章指出，现在越来越清楚地看出，苏修在叛卖的泥坑里越滚越深。苏修头目柯西金竟恬不知耻地公开表示欢迎美国杀人犯这个所谓“争取和平的倡议”。勃列日涅夫、柯西金叛徒集团正在变本加厉地为缔结苏美新的欺骗性条约创造条件。
    文章说，各国革命人民早就识破了苏美合作主宰世界的鬼蜮伎俩。他们对帝国主义和修正主义的“和平”不抱幻想。苏修和美帝在导弹方面缔结新条约的阴谋也绝对欺骗不了世界人民。
