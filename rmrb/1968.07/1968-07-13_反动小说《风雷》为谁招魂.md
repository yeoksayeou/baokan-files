	The Reactionary Novel "Storm and Thunder" Summons Whose Spirits
	Chen Tingyi, Worker at Anhui Mechanical Factory

	Recently, the newspapers have launched a criticism of the reactionary novel "Storm and Thunder." We workers believe that this criticism is excellent!

	Criticizing the reactionary novel "Storm and Thunder" is not just a matter of criticizing one book; it is a struggle between two classes, two lines, and two paths. The essence of this struggle, as our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us, is "the continuation of the long-term struggle between the Chinese Communist Party and the Kuomintang reactionaries under the leadership of the broad revolutionary masses, and the continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie."

	The counter-revolutionary Chen Dengke, in "Storm and Thunder," repeatedly shouts about "seeking his father." Who is this "father" he seeks? It is the one who left deep "footprints" on the land of Huabei—China's Khrushchev. Chen Dengke and his ilk spare no effort in "seeking" China's Khrushchev as their "father," ultimately aiming to bring back the Kuomintang reactionaries. China's Khrushchev is the agent of the Kuomintang reactionaries within our party. If his plot to usurp the party and restore the old order succeeds, the Kuomintang reactionaries will once again ride roughshod over the working people, wielding power and acting arrogantly.

	The reactionary novel "Storm and Thunder," with its tens of thousands of words, is summoning whose spirits? Chen Dengke maliciously inserts a scene in the novel where Fang Xuedong sings a song. Fang Xuedong sings: "... Capture Du Yuming, eliminate Huang Biao. Cross the Yangtze River, overthrow the Chiang Kai-shek regime." This revolutionary song makes the counter-revolutionary Chen Dengke feel "extremely annoyed." Through the mouth of the "hero" character Zhu Yongkang in the book, he viciously curses: "Good father, kill me with your knife, I'd rather hear dogs barking than listen to you sing." Why doesn't Chen Dengke like hearing "Capture Du Yuming, eliminate Huang Biao"? Why does he feel more tormented by "overthrow the Chiang Kai-shek regime" than by being "killed"? This clearly shows that this fellow is a loyal son and grandson of the Chiang Kai-shek regime, completely standing on the side of the Kuomintang reactionaries. For this reason, in "Storm and Thunder," he fiercely advocates for reversing verdicts and promoting individual farming, attempting to overthrow proletarian dictatorship, restore capitalism, and summon the spirits of the Kuomintang reactionaries!

	What kind of person is the author of "Storm and Thunder," Chen Dengke? This fellow is a die-hard remnant of the Kuomintang reactionaries. Such a counter-revolutionary was able to stay in the revolutionary ranks for so long and, under the guise of a "worker-peasant writer," write reactionary novels, mainly because he had the support of China's Khrushchev. Chen Dengke once openly said: "This book (Storm and Thunder) was written according to the intentions of those above." By "those above," he means China's Khrushchev.

	All of this strongly demonstrates that our criticism of the reactionary novel "Storm and Thunder" is a struggle against the remnants of the Kuomintang reactionaries, a struggle against China's Khrushchev who represents the interests of the Kuomintang reactionaries, and a continuation of our long-term struggle against the Kuomintang reactionaries.

	The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a political revolution against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes. We, the working class, must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and carry this political revolution through to the end. We will not lay down our arms until we achieve complete victory!

    反动小说《风雷》为谁招魂
    皖安机械厂工人　陈廷宜
    最近，报纸上开展了对反动小说《风雷》的批判。我们工人认为，这个批判好得很！
    批判反动小说《风雷》，决不是简单的批判一本书的问题，而是两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争。这场斗争的实质，正如伟大领袖毛主席教导我们的：“是中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续，是无产阶级和资产阶级阶级斗争的继续。”
    反革命分子陈登科，在《风雷》中口口声声叫嚷要“寻父”。他要“寻”的“父”是什么人呢？就是那个在淮北土地上留下过深深“足印”的中国赫鲁晓夫。陈登科之流千方百计，不遗余力地“寻”中国赫鲁晓夫这个“父”，归根结底，就是为了把国民党反动派“寻”回来。中国赫鲁晓夫是国民党反动派在我们党内的代理人。他的篡党复辟阴谋如果得逞，国民党反动派就会重新骑在劳动人民的头上，作威作福，横行霸道。
    反动小说《风雷》，洋洋几十万言，它是在为什么人招魂呢？陈登科在小说中居心险恶地穿插了方旭东唱歌的一个镜头。方旭东唱道：“……活捉杜聿明，消灭黄伯韬。打过长江去，推翻蒋家王朝。”这样一首革命歌曲，反革命分子陈登科听着却感到“厌烦极了”。他通过书中的“英雄”人物祝永康之口恶毒地咒骂道：“好爸爸，你拿刀杀死我吧，愿听狗咬仗，也不听你唱唱”。陈登科为什么不爱听“活捉杜聿明，消灭黄伯韬”？为什么一听到“推翻蒋家王朝”就感到比“杀死”他还难受？这就清楚地表明了：这个家伙是蒋家王朝的孝子贤孙，是完全站在国民党反动派立场上的。正因为如此，他在《风雷》中，大刮翻案黑风，大刮单干黑风，妄图推翻无产阶级专政，复辟资本主义，为国民党反动派招魂！
    《风雷》的作者陈登科是什么货色呢？这个家伙是一个地地道道的国民党反动派的残渣余孽。这样一个反革命分子，所以能够长期混在革命队伍里，并且披着“工农作家”的外衣，大写特写反动小说，最主要的原因，就是因为有中国赫鲁晓夫撑腰。陈登科曾经毫不隐讳地说：“我这本书（《风雷》）是根据上面意图写的。”所谓“上面”，指的就是中国赫鲁晓夫。
    这一切，都有力地说明：我们批判反动小说《风雷》，正是和国民党反动派的残渣余孽作斗争，正是和代表国民党反动派利益的中国赫鲁晓夫作斗争，正是我们和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续。
    无产阶级文化大革命，是一场反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命。我们工人阶级一定要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，把这场政治大革命进行到底。不获全胜，决不收兵！
