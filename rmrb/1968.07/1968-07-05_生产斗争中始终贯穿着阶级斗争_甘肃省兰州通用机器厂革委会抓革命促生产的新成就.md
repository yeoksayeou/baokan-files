Lanzhou General Machinery Factory is an old factory with nearly a hundred years of history. During the Qing Dynasty and the rule of the reactionary Kuomintang, the roots of feudalism and capitalism were deeply entrenched. After liberation, a handful of capitalist roaders within the party implemented the anti-revolutionary revisionist line of running enterprises advocated by Chinese Khrushchev. Therefore, class struggle within the factory has always been extremely complex, sharp, and intense.

In February of this year, the factory revolutionary committee was established amidst the waves of class struggle. At that time, a small number of comrades believed that the power of the factory was already in the hands of the revolutionary cadres of the proletariat, and the production tasks assigned by the state were heavy, so efforts should be concentrated on production. Under the influence of this thought, for a period of time, there were fewer big-character posters, and fewer criticism meetings were held. A handful of class enemies took the opportunity to jump out, sowing discord between the revolutionary committee and the revolutionary workers, directly pointing their spears at the newly born revolutionary committee and the People's Liberation Army. They brazenly shouted: "The methods of the PLA are not effective in the factory, let's see, easy to enter but hard to leave!"

The factory revolutionary committee and the revolutionary workers, with the help of the PLA's leftist support personnel, analyzed the class struggle situation within the factory. They further realized that class struggle is always intertwined with production struggle. To push production forward, it is necessary to resolutely implement Chairman Mao's great line of "grasp revolution, promote production." It is necessary to vigorously promote the experience of the PLA in emphasizing proletarian politics, starting from a firm grasp of class struggle, using revolution to drive production. If class struggle is forgotten and production is pursued in isolation, not only will production not be promoted, but even the newly born revolutionary committee may face the danger of being overthrown.

Members of the revolutionary committee and the broad masses of revolutionary workers earnestly implemented Chairman Mao's latest instructions on the "Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, which is essentially a great political revolution of the proletariat under socialist conditions, a continuation of the long-term struggle between the Chinese Communist Party and its led revolutionary masses and the reactionary Kuomintang, and a continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie." They smashed the sabotage plots of a handful of traitors, spies, unrepentant capitalist-roaders, and other counter-revolutionary elements, and further criticized Chinese Khrushchev's theory of the "extinction of class struggle." The revolutionary enthusiasm of the broad masses of workers soared, and their enthusiasm for production was boundless. The entire factory presented a new situation of vigorously grasping revolution and vigorously promoting production.

Vice Chairman Lin said: "The contradictions, antagonisms, and struggles between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie have become the root source of all our political and social life." In the process of developing the excellent situation of grasping revolution and promoting production, Lanzhou General Machinery Factory has been engaged in one class struggle after another.

The desperate few class enemies, unwilling to accept their own demise, always struggle to the last. Seeing that the revolutionary tide is irresistible, they changed their counter-revolutionary strategies, adopting the vicious tactic of using attack as defense, using the disruption of production to disrupt the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. A class enemy disguised as a "technical authority" sneaked into the casting workshop under the pretext of helping to promote new technology. He deliberately exaggerated the harm of sand dust to the human body among the sanding workers, inciting them to stop production. After discovering this situation, members of the factory revolutionary committee immediately went deep into the casting workshop and, together with the workers, analyzed this problem from the perspective of class and class struggle, making everyone realize that this was a class struggle. Many workers said: "'Grasp revolution, promote production' is Chairman Mao's battle call to the working class. We must firmly guard our production posts and never fall for the tricks of the class enemies!" They exposed the conspiracy of the class enemy disguised as a "technical authority" and, with boundless enthusiasm, grasped revolution and promoted production. In May, the production level of the workshop increased severalfold compared to the beginning of the year.

In the assembly workshop, another intense class struggle took place. In March, the construction workers of the construction science department were building a steam heating furnace in the assembly workshop, and the task was urgent. A capitalist-roader in this department took advantage of this opportunity to sabotage the work. He put on a hypocritical face of caring for the workers, deceiving some workers, and stirred up a counter-revolutionary economic wind, attempting to interrupt the repair and construction of the steam heating furnace, making the machine unable to be matched, and unable to produce finished products. However, this class enemy's trick was not completed before being exposed by the revolutionary workers. The broad masses of revolutionary workers used high-level production to strongly counterattack the sabotage of the class enemies. In May, the construction science department completed a workload equivalent to twice the total of the previous four months.

In April, the state required Lanzhou General Machinery Factory to produce more and better wax removal machines to meet the needs of the petroleum industry. The factory revolutionary committee, according to the state's requirements, formulated the production plan for April. Once the production plan was determined, a capitalist-roader who had infiltrated the production command department began to sabotage it. He stirred up trouble among the masses, saying: "Producing fifteen wax removal machines in one month, looking at the history of Lanzhou General Machinery Factory, there has never been such a high level!" When workers urged him to quickly arrange for the processing of wax removal machine parts, he said: "Don't be in a hurry, this plan is definitely not going to be completed." He also directed his spear at the PLA leftist support personnel stationed in the factory and the factory revolutionary committee, saying that "the plan was made by them, and if it is not completed, let's see how they get off the stage." This reactionary also used his authority to withhold the production tasks of seven parts, not issuing them to the workshop until April 17, intending to sabotage the April production plan. Under the leadership of the factory revolutionary committee, everyone criticized and fought against this reactionary who had usurped the leadership position.

The living reality of class struggle deeply educated the masses. The workers unanimously said: "The enemy sabotages the production plan, and we must definitely complete the production plan, for Chairman Mao! This battle in April must be won decisively, and the fifteen wax removal machines must be completed!" All parts of the fifteen wax removal machines were completed by April 23. According to the time quota, it seemed impossible to complete the assembly task of fifteen wax removal machines in the remaining seven days. However, the socialist production enthusiasm of the broad masses of workers armed with Mao Zedong Thought, how could it be calculated by the time quota! The workers in the assembly workshop drew infinite wisdom and strength from Chairman Mao's works, with boundless loyalty to the great leader Mao Zedong, and with boundless hatred for the class enemies, they fought continuously for six days and six nights, and on April 29, they successfully completed the production task of fifteen wax removal machines, creating the highest monthly production record since the factory produced wax removal machines.

The victory in the struggle against the enemy further boosted the enthusiasm of the broad masses of revolutionary workers in grasping revolution and promoting production. Previously, this factory implemented a revisionist line, using systems to "control" and "restrict" workers. Now, workers insist on "daily reading," unshakable, and everyone voluntarily observes labor discipline, with high morale and efficiency. The lathe group in the machine shop used to bore speed reducer shells, usually two shifts to bore one, but now with the same equipment and people, the efficiency is greatly different, one shift can bore one and a half. A responsible comrade of the factory revolutionary committee said: Originally, when calculating this year's production tasks, there was a shortage of 40,000 man-hours for riveting and welding alone, thinking and thinking, there was no way. Now the facts prove that the wisdom of the masses is boundless. As long as armed with Mao Zedong Thought, miracles can be created. Since this year, the factory's production has been rising month by month. In April, it created the highest monthly production record of wax removal machines in the factory's history. In May, it excellently completed the production task of oil extraction machines, realizing their wish to report good news to Chairman Mao with excellent production achievements.

    生产斗争中始终贯穿着阶级斗争
    ——甘肃省兰州通用机器厂革委会抓革命促生产的新成就
    兰州通用机器厂是个有近百年历史的老厂，在清朝和国民党反动派统治时期，封建主义和资本主义毒根扎得很深。解放后党内一小撮走资派执行了中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义办企业路线。因此，厂里的阶级斗争一直是极其复杂、尖锐和激烈的。
    今年二月份，厂革命委员会在阶级斗争风浪中成立了。当时，有少部分同志认为，工厂大权已掌握在无产阶级革命派手里，国家交给的生产任务很重，应该集中力量抓一下生产了。在这种思想的影响下，有一段时间，大字报少了，批判会也开得少了。一小撮阶级敌人趁机跳了出来，挑拨离间革委会同革命职工的关系，直接把矛头指向新生的革命委员会和人民解放军。他们凶相毕露地叫嚣：“解放军的那一套在工厂吃不开，走着看，好进难出！”
    厂革委会和革命职工，在解放军支左人员帮助下，分析了厂内阶级斗争状况。他们进一步认识到：生产斗争中始终贯穿着阶级斗争，要把生产促上去，必须坚决贯彻执行毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，必须大力推行人民解放军突出无产阶级政治的经验，从狠抓阶级斗争入手，以革命带动生产；如果忘记了阶级斗争，单纯搞生产，不仅生产搞不上去，甚至新生的革命委员会也有被颠覆的危险。
    革委会成员和广大革命职工，认真落实毛主席关于“无产阶级文化大革命，实质上是在社会主义条件下，无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命，是中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续，是无产阶级和资产阶级阶级斗争的继续”的最新指示，击破一小撮叛徒、特务、死不悔改的走资派和其他反革命分子的破坏阴谋，同时进一步批判了中国赫鲁晓夫的“阶级斗争熄灭”论。广大革命职工革命热情高涨，生产干劲冲天，全厂出现了狠抓革命、猛促生产的新局面。
    林副主席说：“无产阶级和资产阶级这两个阶级的矛盾、对立、对抗、斗争，成为我们全部的政治生活、社会生活的一个总根源。”兰州通用机器厂在发展抓革命促生产大好形势的过程中，一直进行着一场又一场阶级斗争。
    日暮途穷的一小撮阶级敌人，总是不甘心自己的死亡，总是要进行垂死挣扎。他们眼看革命洪流势不可挡，便变换反革命策略，采取以攻为守的恶毒手段，以破坏生产来破坏无产阶级文化大革命。一个披着“技术权威”外衣的阶级敌人，打着帮助推行新技术的幌子，溜进了铸模车间。他在清砂工人中间，故意渲染砂尘对人体的危害，煽动工人停产。厂革委会的成员发现这一情况后，当即深入到铸模车间，和工人一起用阶级和阶级斗争的观点分析了这个问题，使大家认识到这就是阶级斗争。许多工人说：“‘抓革命，促生产’，是毛主席向我们工人阶级发出的战斗号召，我们一定要坚守生产岗位，决不能上阶级敌人的当！”他们戳穿了那个披着“技术权威”外衣的阶级敌人的阴谋，并且以无比的热情抓革命促生产。五月份，车间的生产水平比年初提高了好几倍。
    在装配车间，也发生了一场激烈的阶级斗争。三月份，基建科的瓦工正在装配车间砌蒸汽加热炉，任务很紧。这个科的一个走资派利用这个机会，从中进行破坏。他装出关心工人的伪善面孔，欺骗一些工人，刮起一股反革命经济主义妖风，妄图中断蒸汽加热炉的修砌工作，使机器不能配套，生产不出成品。但是，这个阶级敌人的鬼花招还没耍完，就被革命职工识破了。广大革命职工用高水平的生产来狠狠地回击阶级敌人的破坏，五月份基建科完成的工作量，相当于前四个月总和的两倍。
    四月份，国家要求兰州通用机器厂生产更多更好的清蜡机，以适应石油工业战线的需要。厂革命委员会根据国家的要求，制定了四月份的生产计划。生产计划一确定，混入生产指挥部的一个走资派，就进行破坏。他在群众中大煽阴风，胡说：“一个月生产十五台清蜡机，查查兰通厂的历史，还没这个高水平！”工人催他赶快安排清蜡机部件的加工，他说：“别着急，这个计划肯定完不成。”他还把矛头指向驻厂解放军支左人员和厂革委会，说什么“计划是他们定的，完不成看他们怎样下台”。这个反动家伙还利用职权扣着七个部件的生产任务，拖到四月十七日还不往车间下达，妄想破坏四月份的生产计划。在厂革命委员会的领导下，大家对这个窃据领导岗位的反动分子进行了批判和斗争。
    活生生的阶级斗争现实，深刻地教育了群众。工人们一致表示：“敌人破坏生产计划，我们就一定要完成生产计划，为毛主席争气！四月份这一仗要坚决打胜，十五台清蜡机非完成不可！”这十五台清蜡机的零件全部生产完毕，已经是四月二十三日了。按工时定额计算，要在剩下的七天时间里完成十五台清蜡机的总装任务，看来是很难办到的。但是，用毛泽东思想武装起来的广大工人的社会主义生产积极性，怎么能用工时定额计算！装配车间的工人从毛主席的宝书中得到了无穷的智慧和力量，他们怀着对伟大领袖毛主席的无限忠诚，怀着对阶级敌人的无比仇恨，连续苦战六天六夜，在四月二十九日胜利地完成了十五台清蜡机的生产任务，创造了这个厂生产清蜡机以来的月产最高纪录。
    对敌斗争的胜利，使广大革命职工抓革命促生产的积极性更加高涨。过去这个厂实行的是一套修正主义路线，用制度“管”、“卡”工人。而现在，工人坚持“天天读”，雷打不动，每个人都自觉遵守劳动纪律，干劲足，工效高。金工车间的镗工组，原来镗变速箱壳子，一向是两个班镗一个，如今仍是原来的设备、原来的人，但工效大不相同了，一个班能镗一个半。厂革委会的一位负责同志说：原来计算今年的生产任务，光铆焊工就差四万个工时，想来想去没办法。现在事实说明，群众的智慧无穷，只要用毛泽东思想武装起来，就能创造出人间奇迹。今年以来，全厂生产月月上升。四月份创造了本厂历史上月产清蜡机的最高纪录。五月份出色地完成了采油机的生产任务，实现了他们以优异的生产成绩向毛主席报喜的愿望。
