Our Female Committee Member

A Record of Comrade Chen Hedie, Standing Committee Member of the Shanghai Fluorescent Lamp Factory Revolutionary Committee

Comrade Chen Hedie of the Shanghai Fluorescent Lamp Factory has, since June 1966, braved the white terror of the bourgeois reactionary line and has been diligently studying Chairman Mao’s works. Following Chairman Mao’s great strategic deployments, under the unified arrangements of the factory revolutionary committee, she has actively led everyone in a fierce attack on the class enemy, seizing the revolution and promoting production, achieving remarkable results. Comrades say that she dares to confront and challenge the bourgeois reactionary line; she dares to criticize all incorrect thoughts and actions; she dares to expose and struggle against her own shortcomings and mistakes. Comrades say, such a female committee member, we trust her, she is a good example for us to learn from! Both an Official and a Commoner

The Shanghai Fluorescent Lamp Factory Revolutionary Committee was established. Comrade Chen Hedie was elected into the revolutionary committee to serve as a standing committee member.

After becoming a standing committee member of the factory revolutionary committee, Chen Hedie realized that women participating in the revolutionary power structure is a victory of Chairman Mao’s revolutionary line, and she must strive for Chairman Mao. She eagerly studied Chairman Mao’s works, always following his teachings of “People’s work is different, their positions are different, but no matter how big an official is, among the people, they must appear as an ordinary laborer. They must not allow themselves to be arrogant” and “Both an official and a commoner.” She insisted on laboring. When there were important meetings, she would request leave from the group leader; the work left behind would be completed after the meeting. The veteran workers saw her doing this and were very pleased, saying to her, “Hedie, you are busy with work, we will handle the production tasks!” They volunteered to help her. Chen Hedie said, “If one does not labor, they will become detached from the masses and turn into a revisionist. You must let me labor.”

For a period, due to the shortage of transportation manpower, the coal supply to the boiler room often ran out. Chen Hedie considered that if the boiler stopped, the entire factory’s production would be greatly affected. She went to the boiler room and labored with everyone. At night, she slept in the boiler room. She noticed that the coal was running out, and the workers could not transport it in time, so she pushed the cart to the coal yard to fetch coal herself.

One night, Chen Hedie was thinking about the factory’s plans for seizing the revolution and promoting production. A comrade came to tell her, “Hedie, the person who delivers tea is sick, more than a thousand workers in the factory have no tea to drink, find a way to send someone!” Chen Hedie thought for a moment and replied, “Good, this problem will definitely be solved tomorrow!” Starting the next day, Chen Hedie and several members of the revolutionary committee took turns pushing the tea cart, delivering tea to each workshop.

Uniting All Revolutionary Forces

After the establishment of the factory revolutionary committee, the revolutionary and production situation in each workshop was good, except for the third workshop where the phenomena of anarchism were relatively serious. Some comrades just frowned and were not very willing to go, fearing they would be pushed back. Chen Hedie went several times, but the effect was not great. Someone suggested severely criticizing the third workshop. Chen Hedie, with her questions, studied Chairman Mao’s latest instructions: “Holding study classes is a good method, many problems can be solved in study classes.” She said at the committee meeting, “The problem in the third workshop is an ideological problem, it cannot be simplified. Some comrades argue with us mainly because the poison of the bourgeois reactionary line has not been eradicated, and this is our responsibility because we are in power. Chairman Mao said, we must not only unite with those who agree with us, but also be good at uniting with those who disagree with us, and even those who have opposed us and have been proven wrong by practice. We should do as Chairman Mao says. I suggest that the revolutionary committee go to the workshop to hold study classes, study together, and struggle against selfishness and revisionism together.”

Chen Hedie’s opinion was strongly supported by the committee members. Chen Hedie exposed her selfishness and struggled against it three times in the study class. She said, “We are all revolutionary comrades, the main reason for the estrangement is that the committee members have not gone deep enough, and they do not respect the different opinions of a few people enough. I am more responsible, I hope everyone will criticize me strictly. We must learn from everyone, do a good job in production, strive for Chairman Mao, and do not let the handful of capitalist roaders within the party laugh at us.”

Her words deeply moved those who originally had objections to her. Some said, “Hedie speaks from the heart, the two burdens of revolution and production should be carried by everyone, everyone should be concerned.”

Chen Hedie rarely rested on weekends, always bringing her children to visit workers. Workers said, “Chen Hedie’s weekends are spent in other people’s homes.” Chen Hedie said, “This is also what the masses teach me to do, every family I visit, I gain one more bit of education!”

With Chen Hedie’s help, the ideological level of the workers in the third workshop improved, labor discipline improved, and the workshop took on a new look. The production of fluorescent powder and mercury returned to normal, and fluorescent lamps were continuously shipped out of the factory to the country.

Strengthening the Unity of the Revolutionary Committee

At one time, a member of the revolutionary committee spoke to Chen Hedie about some opinions on certain members of the factory revolutionary committee. Chen Hedie listened patiently and sincerely, saying, “We can discuss our opinions on the table, Chairman Mao strongly opposes not speaking in front but talking behind one’s back, not speaking in meetings but talking outside of meetings. This liberalist style will cause us to split, so we must resolutely oppose it.” Later, this committee member accepted the criticism and no longer talked about others’ shortcomings behind their backs.

Once, Chen Hedie heard someone say that the revolutionary committee had split into two factions. Chen Hedie quickly brought the two committee members with different opinions together and said seriously, “Someone says you have split into two factions, is this true? You two are both members of the factory revolutionary committee, if you split into two factions, the factory will be in chaos, and it will be easy for a handful of class enemies to take advantage. This is not good for the revolution! The locomotive cannot derail, we are making a revolution, and we cannot take a single step away from Chairman Mao’s revolutionary line!”

They studied Chairman Mao’s latest instructions together, Chairman Mao’s brilliant thoughts illuminated the hearts of the proletarian revolutionary fighters, making them unite closely.

Breaking Old Tracks, Walking New Paths

In March, a few revolutionary workers from another province proposed to the factory a new product creation issue. This new product is something that does not exist internationally. The factory revolutionary committee and the masses discussed and decided to accept it. When it came to the trial production of this new product, everyone had some resentment because someone had proposed it before. But the former authorities heard that foreigners had not yet succeeded, and immediately withdrew, shamelessly saying, “Foreigners can’t do it, what can we do!”

Now, the proletarian revolutionary forces are in power, how should it be done? In the past, the old tracks bound the workers’ hands and feet, with a set of rules and regulations: saying that first, research must be done, second, foreign materials must be digested, third...

Chen Hedie said, “That set is not proletarian, we proletarians do not rely on anything but Mao Zedong Thought for anything we do.” Thus, she and revolutionary cadres specially organized a team to study Chairman Mao’s brilliant works “On Practice” and “The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains” and the relevant instructions from the central leaders. In the study, they fiercely criticized the revisionist industrial line of China’s Khrushchev, establishing Chairman Mao’s policy that the technological revolution must be a mass movement. In the past, the old leadership issued orders from above, and the workers struggled below; now, Chen Hedie and other members of the revolutionary committee labored day and night with everyone. When the trial production encountered setbacks, she organized everyone to study “The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains” and Chairman Mao’s quotations, finally overcoming numerous difficulties and successfully producing a new product that foreigners do not have. Comrades forgot the fatigue of many days, excitedly shouting, “Long live Chairman Mao! Long live! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand ten thousand years!”

    我们的女委员
    ——记上海荧光灯厂革委会常委陈荷娣同志
    上海荧光灯厂的陈荷娣同志，从一九六六年六月在资产阶级反动路线的白色恐怖下冲杀出来起，一直活学活用毛主席著作。她紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，在厂革委会的统一部署下，积极带领大家向阶级敌人猛烈进攻，抓革命、促生产，取得了显著的成绩。同志们说，她对资产阶级反动路线敢顶敢闯；对于一切错误思想、行为敢于批评；对于自己的缺点、错误敢亮敢斗。同志们说，象这样的女委员，我们信得过，是我们学习的好榜样！既当“官”，又当老百姓
    上海荧光灯厂革命委员会成立了。陈荷娣同志被选进革命委员会担任了常委。
    陈荷娣当上厂革委会常委后，认识到妇女参加革命的政权机构，是毛主席革命路线的胜利，一定要为毛主席争气。她如饥似渴地学习毛主席著作，处处遵照毛主席的“人们的工作有所不同，职务有所不同，但是任何人不论官有多大，在人民中间都要以一个普通劳动者的姿态出现。决不许可摆架子”和“既当‘官’，又当老百姓”的教导，一直坚持劳动。有重要会议，就向组长请假；留下的工作开完会后再去做完。老师傅看到她这样做，心里很高兴，对她说：“荷娣，你工作忙，生产任务我们顶！”抢着帮她做。陈荷娣说：“不劳动就会脱离群众，要变修的，你们要让我劳动。”
    有一段时候，因为运输人力紧张，锅炉房的用煤常常脱节。陈荷娣考虑到如果锅炉一停，全厂生产就要大受影响。她就到锅炉房，和大家一起劳动，晚上就睡在锅炉房。她发觉煤快用完了，工人来不及搬运，自己就推起车子到煤库去运煤。
    有一天晚上，陈荷娣正在考虑厂里抓革命、促生产的计划，有个同志来告诉她说：“荷娣，送茶工人生病了，全厂一千多工人没茶喝啦，想办法派个人来吧！”陈荷娣想了想，回答说：“好，明天一定解决这个问题！”从第二天开始，陈荷娣就和革委会几个成员轮流推着茶水桶，一个车间一个车间地送茶。团结一切革命力量
    厂革委会成立后，厂里各车间的革命和生产形势都很好，就是制造荧光粉和水银的三车间无政府主义现象较为严重。对于这个车间，有的同志只是皱眉头，不大愿意去，怕被顶回来。陈荷娣去过几次，效果不大。有人说要好好地批评三车间。陈荷娣带着问题学习了毛主席的最新指示：“办学习班，是个好办法，很多问题可以在学习班得到解决。”她在革委会的会上说：“三车间的问题是个思想问题，不能简单化，有些同志和我们顶牛，主要是资产阶级反动路线流毒没肃清，这是我们的责任，因为我们掌权了嘛。毛主席说，不但要团结和自己意见相同的人，而且要善于团结那些和自己意见不同的人，还要善于团结那些反对过自己并且已被实践证明是犯了错误的人。毛主席怎么说，我们就应该怎么做。我建议革委会到车间里去办学习班，和他们一起学习，一起斗私批修。”
    陈荷娣的意见得到委员们的热烈支持。陈荷娣三次在学习班里亮私斗私。她说：“我们都是革命同志，产生隔阂的原因主要是革委会同志没深入下来，对少数人的不同意见尊重不够，我责任更大，希望大家对我严格批评。我们一定要向大家学习，把生产搞好，为毛主席争气，不要让党内一小撮走资派笑话。”
    她的话深深地打动了原来对她有意见的人。有的人说：“荷娣讲的是真心话，革命、生产这两副担子应该大家来挑，大家来操心。”
    陈荷娣星期天极少休息，总是带着孩子去访问工人，工人同志说：“陈荷娣的星期天是在人家家里过的。”陈荷娣却说：“这也是群众教我这样做的，我每走一家，就多得到一分教育！”
    在陈荷娣的帮助下，三车间职工的思想提高了，劳动纪律改善了，车间里一派新气象。荧光粉和水银生产正常，荧光灯又源源出厂，送向全国。加　强　革　委　会　的　团　结
    有一个时期，革委会中有一个成员在陈荷娣面前讲了不少对厂革委会某些成员的看法，陈荷娣听了，耐心而诚恳地说：“我们有意见可以拿到桌面上谈，毛主席最反对当面不说背后乱说，会上不讲会外乱讲，这种自由主义作风会使我们产生分裂，所以我们要坚决反对。”后来这位委员接受了批评，再也不在背后乱说别人的缺点了。
    有一次，陈荷娣听到有人说革委会内分成了两派。陈荷娣听了，急忙把持有不同意见的两名委员拉到一块，严肃地说：“有人说你们分成两派，到底有这回事没有？你们两个人都是厂革委会成员，一分两派，厂里就会乱，容易被一小撮阶级敌人钻空子，这对革命不利啊！火车头不能脱轨，我们闹革命，一步也不能离开毛主席的革命路线啊！”
    他们一起学习毛主席的最新指示，毛主席的光辉思想照亮了无产阶级革命派战士的心，使他们亲密地团结起来了。拆　旧　轨，　走
　  新路
    三月份，外地一个单位的几位革命工人向厂里提出了一种新产品的创制问题。这种新产品还是国际上所没有的。厂革委会和群众一商量，决定接受下来了。提起这种新产品的试制，大家就有一股怨气，因为以前也有人提出过。但是旧当权派一听说外国目前还没有，马上就缩了回去，无耻地说：“外国人都搞不成功，我们搞个屁！”
    现在是无产阶级革命派掌了权，该怎么搞呢？过去，旧轨道束缚了工人的手脚，条条框框一大套：说什么第一要研究，第二要消化国外资料，第三……
    陈荷娣说：“那一套不是无产阶级的，我们无产阶级不管做什么事，第一是靠毛泽东思想。”于是，她和革命干部专门组织了一个班子，学习毛主席的光辉著作《实践论》《愚公移山》和中央首长有关指示，在学习中狠批中国赫鲁晓夫的修正主义工业路线，确立毛主席的技术革命必须搞群众运动的方针。过去旧领导在上面发号施令，工人在下面拚命；如今，陈荷娣和其他革委会成员日日夜夜和大家一起劳动。试制工作遇到挫折，她便组织大家学习《愚公移山》，学习毛主席语录，终于克服了重重困难，试制成功了外国还没有的新产品。同志们忘记了多日的疲劳，兴奋地高呼“毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！”
