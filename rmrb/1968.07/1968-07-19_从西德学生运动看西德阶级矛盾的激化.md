In recent years, the West German student movement has seen significant development, especially this year, with waves of protests growing stronger. In mid-April, a leader of a West German student organization was injured by reactionary elements, sparking a massive anti-fascist protest movement that swept through over five hundred towns, involving thirty thousand participants. In late May, as the West German Parliament was about to pass the "Emergency Powers Act," students and workers launched a new wave of protests. Almost all universities in West Germany went on strike, with many students occupying school buildings and raising red flags. In over forty cities, tens of thousands of students and workers held protest rallies and demonstrations, with some even occupying radio stations and storming city halls. The scale and intensity of this struggle were unprecedented in the history of post-war West German student movements. Under the influence of West German students and workers, in late June, thirty thousand people from West Germany and various European countries held a massive demonstration, protesting against the West German authorities' protection and encouragement of neo-fascist forces and the forced passage of the reactionary "Emergency Powers Act." In the past month, over sixty thousand students from all engineering colleges in West Germany went on strike and demonstrated, strongly demanding educational reforms. The struggle continues to this day. The West German student movement has powerfully shaken the reactionary rule of the monopoly bourgeoisie, reaching a new stage.

The development of the West German student movement has caused the reactionary ruling clique to panic. The West German cabinet and the West Berlin city government hastily convened emergency meetings to discuss countermeasures. On one hand, they used counter-revolutionary violence, deploying large numbers of police, mounted units, water cannons, and police dogs to attack the demonstrators, arresting many students and sentencing some to harsh penalties, brutally suppressing the movement. On the other hand, they played political deception, with the Social Democratic Party leader and Vice-Chancellor Brandt publicly expressing a willingness to negotiate with student organizations, while attempting to divide and weaken the student ranks. However, no matter how the West German reactionary ruling clique uses both soft and hard tactics, they cannot stop the struggle of the increasingly awakened West German students and the masses from continuing to advance.

The development of the West German student movement began with opposition to the decadent bourgeois educational system, but it quickly expanded beyond this scope, becoming a large-scale mass movement.

Currently, the West German student movement has combined with the workers' movement and broken through traditional forms of struggle such as sit-ins and petitions, beginning to take violent actions. It has also connected with student movements in other countries, influencing and supporting each other. In these aspects, it shares commonalities with student movements in other Western European countries. Additionally, it has its own unique characteristics.

First, the struggle clearly targets West German fascist rule and the capitalist system. In April, West German students focused their attacks on the "Springer Publishing Group," which has long defamed progressive student movements and served as a mouthpiece for West German monopoly capital to promote fascist goals. They also directly targeted West German Chancellor Kiesinger and West Berlin Mayor Sch√ºtz, accusing them of being fascists and demanding their resignation. In May, they launched a large-scale struggle against the passage of the "Emergency Powers Act," strongly countering the reactionary government's provocation of fascist legislation. During the struggle, students clearly raised slogans such as "Smash the state apparatus," "Resist state violence," and "Overthrow the West German system."

Second, the struggle clearly targets American imperialism. The escalation of the Vietnam War by American imperialism further exposed its aggressive nature, increasingly facing strong opposition from the West German people, especially young students. Anti-American protest rallies have been continuous. Last year, West Berlin students held a large-scale protest demonstration against the visit of U.S. Vice President Humphrey. This year in February, students in Frankfurt held a massive rally with twelve thousand participants, strongly condemning American imperialism's aggressive war and passing a resolution to support the Vietnamese people's struggle against American aggression. The demonstrators chanted slogans such as "U.S. out of Vietnam!" "Kill Johnson!" and "American imperialism is the number one enemy of the world's people!" During the April and May struggles, West German youth repeatedly surrounded and stormed institutions such as the "American House," the U.S. Consulate, and the U.S. military headquarters. Youth in Bonn and Bremen even tore down the American flag from the U.S. military headquarters and raised the red flag. The scale and clarity of these anti-American struggles were unprecedented in West Germany and even surpassed the anti-American struggles of students in some other Western European countries.

The vigorous development of the West German student movement reflects the sharpening of class contradictions within West Germany, the worsening economic and political crises of the West German reactionary ruling class, and the unprecedented awakening of the West German people.

First, West Germany has experienced its most severe post-war economic crisis. Since the third quarter of 1966, industrial production has been in absolute decline. In the first half of 1967, industrial production value decreased by six percent compared to the same period last year, and for the whole year, it decreased by 3.2 percent. Monopoly capital, in order to shift difficulties to workers, not only intensified the exploitation of employed workers, implementing unpaid "layoffs" and wage cuts, but also closed factories or partially halted operations, laying off large numbers of workers. This caused the number of unemployed in 1967 to increase by 1.5 to 3 times compared to the same period last year, reaching a maximum of seven hundred thousand. At the same time, the West German government, in order to cover the severe fiscal deficit and increase government investment to stimulate production, increased taxes, raising the income tax on laborers from 19 percent of their income to 25 percent, and implemented a "value-added tax" starting this year, causing prices to soar (such as basic living necessities like rent and electricity, gas, and fuel, which increased by 5.4 to 5.6 percent). The intensified exploitation of the laboring people by West German monopoly capital has sparked widespread resistance, with strikes and protest demonstrations against layoffs, wage cuts, and price increases occurring continuously.

Second, the reactionary policies of the so-called "grand coalition" government are increasingly unpopular. After the fall of the Erhard government at the end of 1966, the ruling Christian Democratic Union and the largest opposition party, the Social Democratic Party, formed a "grand coalition" government led by Kiesinger, attempting to use the deceptive influence of the Social Democratic Party and the absolute majority control of the two parties in parliament to strengthen the deception and control of the people, escape economic difficulties, and consolidate bourgeois rule. However, after the Kiesinger government took office, it not only failed to stop the domestic economic decline but also faced the most severe post-war economic crisis. Apart from increasing taxes and asking the laboring people to tighten their belts, it was at a loss. This could not help but arouse the strong dissatisfaction of the broad masses. To suppress the surging mass movements, the Kiesinger government hastened the fascization process. On one hand, it actively planned and passed the "Emergency Powers Act," allowing the West German ruling clique to, under the pretext of "emergency," strip the people of basic freedoms such as speech, assembly, and strikes, and even deploy reactionary troops to suppress people's struggles with arms. On the other hand, it actively fostered neo-fascist forces. Under its encouragement and protection, currently, over a hundred fascist and revenge-seeking organizations have rapidly proliferated in West Germany, acting openly and publishing magazines. For these fascist organizations' activities, the West German ruling authorities not only dispatched police for protection but also government and party leaders frequently attended and spoke at their meetings, boosting their morale. In recent years, under the patronage of the West German ruling clique, the largest fascist organization, the "National Democratic Party," has rapidly expanded its influence, from its establishment in November 1964 to the present, it has recruited thirty-eight thousand members, of whom one-third to one-half are former Hitler party members, and most of the leading cadres at all levels are Nazis. This new Nazi party is ambitious, aiming to contest the federal elections next year and enter the parliament to prepare for participating in the government. However, the broad West German people have fresh memories of Hitler's evil rule and firmly oppose the West German ruling authorities' reactionary policies of strengthening fascization and reviving Nazi forces, continuously launching powerful protest demonstrations.

Third, the presence of American troops is increasingly causing dissatisfaction among the West German people. The West German people are strongly dissatisfied with the large number of American troops stationed in West Germany (currently still over two hundred thousand) and the deepening of Germany's divided status by the United States, increasingly demanding to shake off American control and solve the German reunification issue. After the Kiesinger government took office, it continued the previous policies. Moreover, in the context of the West German economic crisis, the United States still forced West Germany to bear over seven hundred million dollars annually for its stationed troops, further increasing the burden on the West German people. This further fueled the anti-American sentiment of the West German people, especially the youth, prompting them to strengthen their struggle against the American occupation.

Fourth, the deceptive influence of the Social Democratic Party among the masses is decreasing. After the Social Democratic Party joined the government, it closely colluded with the Christian Democratic Party to serve the ruling clique. Regarding the student movement, it attempted to soften and disintegrate it on one hand, and on the other, it jointly carried out bloody suppression with the Christian Democratic Party. Regarding the workers' resistance against the oppression and exploitation of monopoly capital, it suppressed and sabotaged through yellow unions. Regarding the conspiracy of the monopoly bourgeoisie to pass the "Emergency Powers Act," it actively participated and fully supported it. The Social Democratic Party's betrayal has increasingly been despised by the West German people. In the May struggle of the West German people against the "Emergency Powers Act," many grassroots unions, despite the ban by the Social Democratic Party leaders, resolutely went on strike and fought side by side with the students.

Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches: "The student movement is a part of the entire people's movement. The upsurge of the student movement inevitably promotes the upsurge of the entire people's movement."

The West German student movement is in full swing. As class contradictions within West Germany further intensify, the struggle of West German students will inevitably push the revolutionary struggle of the entire West German people against fascist rule and the monopoly bourgeoisie to a new stage.
