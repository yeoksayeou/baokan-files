In recent years, the West German student movement has seen significant development, especially this year, with waves of protests growing stronger. In mid-April, a leader of a West German student organization was injured by reactionary elements, sparking a massive anti-fascist protest movement that swept through over five hundred towns, involving thirty thousand participants. In late May, as the West German Parliament was about to pass the "Emergency Powers Act," students and workers launched a new wave of protests. Almost all universities in West Germany went on strike, with many students occupying school buildings and raising red flags. In over forty cities, tens of thousands of students and workers held protest rallies and demonstrations, with some even occupying radio stations and storming city halls. The scale and intensity of this struggle were unprecedented in the history of post-war West German student movements. Under the influence of West German students and workers, in late June, thirty thousand people from West Germany and various European countries held a massive demonstration, protesting against the West German authorities' protection and encouragement of neo-fascist forces and the forced passage of the reactionary "Emergency Powers Act." In the past month, over sixty thousand students from all engineering colleges in West Germany went on strike and demonstrated, strongly demanding educational reforms. The struggle continues to this day. The West German student movement has powerfully shaken the reactionary rule of the monopoly bourgeoisie, reaching a new stage.

The development of the West German student movement has caused the reactionary ruling clique to panic. The West German cabinet and the West Berlin city government hastily convened emergency meetings to discuss countermeasures. On one hand, they used counter-revolutionary violence, deploying large numbers of police, mounted units, water cannons, and police dogs to attack the demonstrators, arresting many students and sentencing some to harsh penalties, brutally suppressing the movement. On the other hand, they played political deception, with the Social Democratic Party leader and Vice-Chancellor Brandt publicly expressing a willingness to negotiate with student organizations, while attempting to divide and weaken the student ranks. However, no matter how the West German reactionary ruling clique uses both soft and hard tactics, they cannot stop the struggle of the increasingly awakened West German students and the masses from continuing to advance.

The development of the West German student movement began with opposition to the decadent bourgeois educational system, but it quickly expanded beyond this scope, becoming a large-scale mass movement.

Currently, the West German student movement has combined with the workers' movement and broken through traditional forms of struggle such as sit-ins and petitions, beginning to take violent actions. It has also connected with student movements in other countries, influencing and supporting each other. In these aspects, it shares commonalities with student movements in other Western European countries. Additionally, it has its own unique characteristics.

First, the struggle clearly targets West German fascist rule and the capitalist system. In April, West German students focused their attacks on the "Springer Publishing Group," which has long defamed progressive student movements and served as a mouthpiece for West German monopoly capital to promote fascist goals. They also directly targeted West German Chancellor Kiesinger and West Berlin Mayor Schütz, accusing them of being fascists and demanding their resignation. In May, they launched a large-scale struggle against the passage of the "Emergency Powers Act," strongly countering the reactionary government's provocation of fascist legislation. During the struggle, students clearly raised slogans such as "Smash the state apparatus," "Resist state violence," and "Overthrow the West German system."

Second, the struggle clearly targets American imperialism. The escalation of the Vietnam War by American imperialism further exposed its aggressive nature, increasingly facing strong opposition from the West German people, especially young students. Anti-American protest rallies have been continuous. Last year, West Berlin students held a large-scale protest demonstration against the visit of U.S. Vice President Humphrey. This year in February, students in Frankfurt held a massive rally with twelve thousand participants, strongly condemning American imperialism's aggressive war and passing a resolution to support the Vietnamese people's struggle against American aggression. The demonstrators chanted slogans such as "U.S. out of Vietnam!" "Kill Johnson!" and "American imperialism is the number one enemy of the world's people!" During the April and May struggles, West German youth repeatedly surrounded and stormed institutions such as the "American House," the U.S. Consulate, and the U.S. military headquarters. Youth in Bonn and Bremen even tore down the American flag from the U.S. military headquarters and raised the red flag. The scale and clarity of these anti-American struggles were unprecedented in West Germany and even surpassed the anti-American struggles of students in some other Western European countries.

The vigorous development of the West German student movement reflects the sharpening of class contradictions within West Germany, the worsening economic and political crises of the West German reactionary ruling class, and the unprecedented awakening of the West German people.

First, West Germany has experienced its most severe post-war economic crisis. Since the third quarter of 1966, industrial production has been in absolute decline. In the first half of 1967, industrial production value decreased by six percent compared to the same period last year, and for the whole year, it decreased by 3.2 percent. Monopoly capital, in order to shift difficulties to workers, not only intensified the exploitation of employed workers, implementing unpaid "layoffs" and wage cuts, but also closed factories or partially halted operations, laying off large numbers of workers. This caused the number of unemployed in 1967 to increase by 1.5 to 3 times compared to the same period last year, reaching a maximum of seven hundred thousand. At the same time, the West German government, in order to cover the severe fiscal deficit and increase government investment to stimulate production, increased taxes, raising the income tax on laborers from 19 percent of their income to 25 percent, and implemented a "value-added tax" starting this year, causing prices to soar (such as basic living necessities like rent and electricity, gas, and fuel, which increased by 5.4 to 5.6 percent). The intensified exploitation of the laboring people by West German monopoly capital has sparked widespread resistance, with strikes and protest demonstrations against layoffs, wage cuts, and price increases occurring continuously.

Second, the reactionary policies of the so-called "grand coalition" government are increasingly unpopular. After the fall of the Erhard government at the end of 1966, the ruling Christian Democratic Union and the largest opposition party, the Social Democratic Party, formed a "grand coalition" government led by Kiesinger, attempting to use the deceptive influence of the Social Democratic Party and the absolute majority control of the two parties in parliament to strengthen the deception and control of the people, escape economic difficulties, and consolidate bourgeois rule. However, after the Kiesinger government took office, it not only failed to stop the domestic economic decline but also faced the most severe post-war economic crisis. Apart from increasing taxes and asking the laboring people to tighten their belts, it was at a loss. This could not help but arouse the strong dissatisfaction of the broad masses. To suppress the surging mass movements, the Kiesinger government hastened the fascization process. On one hand, it actively planned and passed the "Emergency Powers Act," allowing the West German ruling clique to, under the pretext of "emergency," strip the people of basic freedoms such as speech, assembly, and strikes, and even deploy reactionary troops to suppress people's struggles with arms. On the other hand, it actively fostered neo-fascist forces. Under its encouragement and protection, currently, over a hundred fascist and revenge-seeking organizations have rapidly proliferated in West Germany, acting openly and publishing magazines. For these fascist organizations' activities, the West German ruling authorities not only dispatched police for protection but also government and party leaders frequently attended and spoke at their meetings, boosting their morale. In recent years, under the patronage of the West German ruling clique, the largest fascist organization, the "National Democratic Party," has rapidly expanded its influence, from its establishment in November 1964 to the present, it has recruited thirty-eight thousand members, of whom one-third to one-half are former Hitler party members, and most of the leading cadres at all levels are Nazis. This new Nazi party is ambitious, aiming to contest the federal elections next year and enter the parliament to prepare for participating in the government. However, the broad West German people have fresh memories of Hitler's evil rule and firmly oppose the West German ruling authorities' reactionary policies of strengthening fascization and reviving Nazi forces, continuously launching powerful protest demonstrations.

Third, the presence of American troops is increasingly causing dissatisfaction among the West German people. The West German people are strongly dissatisfied with the large number of American troops stationed in West Germany (currently still over two hundred thousand) and the deepening of Germany's divided status by the United States, increasingly demanding to shake off American control and solve the German reunification issue. After the Kiesinger government took office, it continued the previous policies. Moreover, in the context of the West German economic crisis, the United States still forced West Germany to bear over seven hundred million dollars annually for its stationed troops, further increasing the burden on the West German people. This further fueled the anti-American sentiment of the West German people, especially the youth, prompting them to strengthen their struggle against the American occupation.

Fourth, the deceptive influence of the Social Democratic Party among the masses is decreasing. After the Social Democratic Party joined the government, it closely colluded with the Christian Democratic Party to serve the ruling clique. Regarding the student movement, it attempted to soften and disintegrate it on one hand, and on the other, it jointly carried out bloody suppression with the Christian Democratic Party. Regarding the workers' resistance against the oppression and exploitation of monopoly capital, it suppressed and sabotaged through yellow unions. Regarding the conspiracy of the monopoly bourgeoisie to pass the "Emergency Powers Act," it actively participated and fully supported it. The Social Democratic Party's betrayal has increasingly been despised by the West German people. In the May struggle of the West German people against the "Emergency Powers Act," many grassroots unions, despite the ban by the Social Democratic Party leaders, resolutely went on strike and fought side by side with the students.

Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches: "The student movement is a part of the entire people's movement. The upsurge of the student movement inevitably promotes the upsurge of the entire people's movement."

The West German student movement is in full swing. As class contradictions within West Germany further intensify, the struggle of West German students will inevitably push the revolutionary struggle of the entire West German people against fascist rule and the monopoly bourgeoisie to a new stage.

    从西德学生运动看西德阶级矛盾的激化
    （一）
    近几年来，西德学生运动有很大发展，特别是今年以来，更是一浪高过一浪。四月中旬，西德一个学生组织的负责人被反动分子刺伤，激起了一场反法西斯暴政的强大抗议示威运动，席卷五百多个城镇，参加者共达三十万人。五月下旬，在西德议会通过“紧急状态法”前夕，学生和工人掀起了抗议斗争的新高潮。几乎全部西德大学都举行了罢课，许多大学的学生还占领校舍，升起红旗。在四十多个城市中，成千上万的学生和工人举行抗议集会和示威，有些地方还占领电台，冲击市政府。这次斗争的规模之大和方式之激烈，在战后西德学生运动史上都是空前的。在西德学生、工人的影响下，六月下旬，三万名西德和来自欧洲各国的群众举行了声势浩大的示威游行，抗议西德当局包庇、纵容新法西斯势力和强行通过反动的“紧急状态法”。近一个月来，西德全部工程院校的六万多名学生又举行罢课示威，强烈要求改革教育制度。目前，这一斗争还在持续发展。西德学生的斗争，有力地冲击了垄断资产阶级的反动统治，发展到了一个新的阶段。
    西德学生运动的发展，使反动统治集团惊恐万状。西德内阁和西柏林市政府都慌忙召开紧急会议，研究对策。他们一面使用反革命暴力，调动大批警察马队、水龙车、警犬向示威群众进攻，逮捕大批学生，并对许多人判刑，进行横蛮镇压；另一方面，大耍政治欺骗手腕，由社会民主党头目、副总理勃兰特出面，假惺惺地表示愿同学生组织会谈，同时对学生队伍进行分化瓦解。但是，不管西德反动统治集团怎样软硬兼施，都阻止不了日益觉醒的西德学生和人民群众的斗争继续往前发展。
    （二）
    西德学生运动的发展是从反对腐朽的资产阶级教育制度开始的，但是运动很快就超出了这个范围，向深广发展，成为大规模的群众运动。
    当前的西德学生运动开始和工人运动结合，并突破静坐、请愿等传统斗争方式，开始采取暴烈行动，同其他国家的学生运动进行串连，相互影响，相互支持，这些方面都和其他西欧国家的学生运动有共同之点。此外，它还具有自己的特点。
    第一、斗争矛头明确指向西德法西斯统治和资本主义制度。四月，西德学生集中力量打击了一贯诬蔑进步学生运动，为法西斯张目的西德垄断资本的喉舌“施波林格报业康采恩”，并将矛头直接指向西德总理基辛格和西柏林市长舒茨等人，谴责他们是法西斯分子，要他们下台。五月，他们又围绕着反对通过“紧急状态法”展开了大规模的斗争，猛烈回击反动当局炮制法西斯法案的挑衅。在斗争中，学生们明确提出“粉碎国家机构”、“反抗国家暴力”、“推翻西德制度”等口号。
    第二、斗争矛头明确指向美帝国主义。美帝国主义发动和扩大侵越战争，进一步暴露了它的侵略本性，日益遭到西德人民特别是青年学生的强烈反对，反美示威集会接连不断。去年西柏林学生为反对美国副总统汉弗莱访问，举行了大规模的抗议示威。今年二月，法兰克福市学生举行了一万二千人参加的声势浩大的集会示威，强烈谴责美帝国主义进行侵略战争，并作出决议，支持越南人民的抗美救国斗争。示威群众高呼：“美国从越南滚出去！”“杀死约翰逊！”“美帝国主义是世界人民的头号敌人！”等口号。在今年四、五月份的斗争中，西德青年曾数次包围和冲击了“美国之家”、美国领事馆、美军总部等机构。波恩和不来梅港的青年还撕下美国驻军总部的星条旗，升起了红旗。这些反美斗争的规模和口号如此鲜明，不但在西德是前所未有的，而且也超过了其他一些西欧国家学生所进行的反美斗争。
    （三）
    西德学生运动的蓬勃发展，反映了西德国内阶级矛盾的尖锐化，反映了西德反动统治阶级经济和政治危机的日益加剧，反映了西德广大人民的空前觉醒。
    一、西德发生了战后最严重的经济危机。自一九六六年第三季度开始，工业生产绝对下降。一九六七年上半年工业生产值比上年同期降低达百分之六，以全年计仍降低百分之三点二。垄断资本为了向工人转嫁困难，除加紧对在业工人残酷剥削，实行不付工资的“歇班”和削减工资外，还关闭厂矿或部分停工，大批解雇工人，使一九六七年各月份的失业人数比上年同期增加一点五倍到三倍，最多时达七十万人。同时，西德政府为了弥补严重的财政赤字和增加政府投资以刺激生产，又大量增加税收，将劳动人民的所得税从占收入的百分之十九提高到百分之二十五，并从今年起实行“增值税”，造成物价高涨（如属于基本生活需要的房租和电、煤气、燃料等分别上涨百分之五点四到百分之五点六）。西德垄断资本加强对劳动人民的剥削，激发起了广大人民的反抗，他们为反对解雇、削减工资和物价上涨而举行的罢工和抗议示威接连不断。
    二、所谓“联合”政府的反动政策日益不得人心。一九六六年底艾哈德政府倒台后，执政的基督教民主联盟和最大的反对党社会民主党共同组成以基辛格为首的“联合”政府，企图利用社会民主党的欺骗作用和两党在议会中控制的绝对多数，加强对人民的欺骗和控制，摆脱经济困难，巩固资产阶级统治。但是，基辛格政府上台后不仅未能制止国内的经济衰退，而且面临战后最严重的经济危机。它除了增加税收、要劳动人民勒紧裤带外，束手无策。这不能不激起广大人民的强烈不满。为了镇压日益高涨的群众运动，基辛格政府加紧法西斯化。一方面，它积极策划和通过了“紧急状态法”，使西德统治集团可以在所谓“紧急状态”的幌子下，剥夺人民的言论、集会、罢工等基本自由，甚至调动反动军队对人民斗争实行武装镇压；另一方面，它积极扶植新法西斯势力。在它的纵容和包庇下，目前西德的法西斯组织和复仇主义组织迅速繁殖，已达到一百多个，活动十分猖獗。它们合法存在，公开出版刊物，经常举行集会。对于这些法西斯组织的集会活动，西德统治当局不但派警察保护，而且政府和各政党的头面人物经常出席讲话，为之鼓气撑腰。近几年来，在西德统治集团的卵翼下，最大的法西斯组织“国家民主党”的势力发展很快，从一九六四年十一月成立到现在已网罗了三万八千名党徒，其中三分之一到一半是原希特勒党徒，各级领导骨干大部分是纳粹分子。这个新纳粹党野心勃勃，要想争取明年大选进入联邦议会，为其参加执政准备条件。然而，广大西德人民对希特勒的罪恶统治记忆犹新，他们坚决反对西德统治当局加强法西斯化、复活纳粹势力的反动政策，不断掀起强大的抗议示威斗争。
    三、美军的占领日益激起西德人民的不满。西德人民对大量美军驻在西德（现仍有二十多万），以及美国加深德国分裂状态强烈不满，日益要求摆脱美国控制，解决德国统一问题。基辛格政府上台以后，依然执行过去政策。加之在西德经济危机情况下，美国仍迫使西德每年为其驻军担负七亿多美元的补助费，更增加了西德人民的沉重负担。这进一步激起西德人民，特别是西德青年的反美情绪，促使他们加强反对美军占领的斗争。
    四、社会民主党在群众中的欺骗作用减少。社会民主党参加政府后，同基督教民主党紧密勾结，为统治集团效劳。对学生运动，它一面设法软化、瓦解，一面伙同基督教民主党进行血腥镇压。对工人反抗垄断资本压迫和剥削的斗争，它通过黄色工会，进行压制和破坏。对垄断资产阶级策划通过“紧急状态法”的阴谋，它积极参与，全力支持。社会民主党的这一切叛卖行为，日益遭到西德人民的唾弃。在今年五月西德人民反对“紧急状态法”的斗争中，许多基层工会不顾社会民主党头目的禁令，毅然举行罢工，同学生并肩战斗。
    我们伟大导师毛主席教导说：“学生运动是整个人民运动的一部分。学生运动的高涨，不可避免地要促进整个人民运动的高涨。”
    西德的学生运动正方兴未艾。随着西德国内阶级矛盾的进一步加剧，西德学生的斗争，必将把整个西德人民群众反对法西斯统治和垄断资产阶级的革命斗争推进到一个新的阶段。
