    Protecting the People and Striking at Class Enemies

    Commander of the former unit of An Yemin, North Sea Fleet, Du Changhe
    Commander of a submarine, North Sea Fleet, Wang Weiming

    Chairman Mao teaches us: "Whether to protect or suppress the broad masses of the people is the fundamental difference between the Communist Party and the Kuomintang, the fundamental difference between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, and the fundamental difference between proletarian dictatorship and bourgeois dictatorship." The opera "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy" fully embodies Chairman Mao's brilliant thought of the mass line. It vividly shows us the different essences of revolutionary and counter-revolutionary armies. The scenes "Asking for Sufferings in the Deep Mountains" and "Mobilizing the Masses" deeply and concisely reflect the flesh-and-blood relationship between the people's army and the masses. It vividly portrays our army, which comes from the people, relies on the people, protects the people, and fights for the people's interests, as a proletarian army. In the scene "Asking for Sufferings in the Deep Mountains," Changbao, with "every word dripping with blood and every sound filled with tears," denounces the heinous crimes of the bandits led by Seatop Mountain Tiger, who brutally suppressed the broad masses of the people. This further ignites Yang Zirong's class hatred and strengthens his resolve to avenge the people. Yang Zirong sings passionately: "All oppressed people under heaven have a book of blood and tears, seeking revenge, seeking justice, blood debts must be repaid with blood." These two lines of lyrics powerfully express the lofty and deep class feelings between revolutionary fighters and the oppressed people.

    The scene "Mobilizing the Masses" depicts the broad masses of people in Jiepigou, who, due to the harm caused by the bandits led by Seatop Mountain Tiger, are in dire straits. They long for the savior's arrival like they long for the stars and the moon. However, when the small detachment first arrived in the village, they did not know that this was the very army they had been longing for day and night, and they even had doubts. The small detachment, following Chairman Mao's teachings, believed in the masses, relied on the masses, and had a heart-to-heart connection with them. They patiently propagated the party's policies to the masses and cared for their sufferings. They treated the old lady like their own family, treating her illness. In extremely difficult living conditions, Xiaojianbo gave the old lady the only bag of rice he had. The small detachment also helped the masses develop production and organized the militia. All of this vividly embodied the people's army's spirit of loving the people, protecting the people, and serving the people wholeheartedly. This is in stark contrast to the bandits led by Seatop Mountain Tiger, who brutally suppressed the people.

    Chairman Mao teaches us: "The army must blend with the people, making the army seen as their own by the people. Such an army will be invincible." The opera "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy" depicts the broad masses of people in Jiepigou, who, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, fought a thrilling class struggle against the Kuomintang reactionaries in the vast forests and snowy plains and achieved victory. This is very similar to our company's life of military-civilian unity and joint defense against the enemy on a remote island far from the mainland! The island where our company is located has only a few dozen households. Before liberation, the fishermen living here, like the people of Jiepigou, often could not eat or wear clothes and were frequently robbed and killed by pirates. How many fisherman brothers were forced to set sail in small fishing boats, braving the wind and waves to seek refuge at sea and were swallowed by the vast ocean! Since the People's Liberation Army stationed itself on the island, the fishermen on the island have gained new life. Now, we often propagate Mao Zedong Thought and the party's policies to the fishermen, care for their sufferings, help them open up wasteland for production, and organize militia training. Like the small detachment in "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy," we think what the masses think and worry about what the masses worry about. In April of this year, two fishermen's houses on the island suddenly caught fire. All the soldiers in our company, taking An Yemin, a communist warrior, as an example, fearlessly fought the fire to extinguish it for the fishermen. We also sent clothes and supplies to the two fishermen who lost their homes to the fire and, together with the masses, helped them build new brick houses on the ruins. An old man was so moved that he cried, "Twenty years ago, there was also a fire on this island, but at that time, one family's fire brought disaster to the neighbors, and no one answered their cries for help. Many families ended up destitute. Now, under the leadership of Chairman Mao, our own army has come, and when one family catches fire, the military and civilians help each other, turning old houses into new ones."

    The fishermen on the island regard us as their own children. When the island suffers from drought and water shortages, the fishermen bring the precious freshwater they have stored, from several kilometers away, to us, vividly embodying the deep bond between the military and the civilians. Over the years, our company, with the strong support of the local fishermen, has formed a political border defense and military-civilian joint defense, successfully completing various tasks such as war preparedness, training, construction, and production, and has been rated as a "Four Good" company for seven consecutive years.

    "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy" is a great opera that praises Chairman Mao's brilliant thoughts on people's war. We are determined to take the heroes in "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy" as our examples, firmly relying on the masses, believing in the masses, protecting the masses, and severely striking at class enemies. With the support of the masses, we will build the island into a red school of Mao Zedong Thought and a solid sea battle fortress.

    保护人民群众打击阶级敌人
    北海舰队安业民生前所在连连长　杜长河
    北海舰队某潜艇艇长　王为明
  毛主席教导我们：“对广大人民群众是保护还是镇压，是共产党同国民党的根本区别，是无产阶级同资产阶级的根本区别，是无产阶级专政同资产阶级专政的根本区别。”《智取威虎山》充分体现了毛主席群众路线的光辉思想。它用生动的形象向我们展示出革命的和反革命的两种军队不同的本质。《深山问苦》和《发动群众》这两场戏，更是深刻地、集中地反映出人民的军队和人民群众之间的血肉关系。它突出地刻划了我军来自人民、依靠人民、保护人民，为人民利益而战斗的无产阶级军队的本质。在《深山问苦》一场中，常宝以“字字血，声声泪”，控诉了座山雕这群匪帮残暴镇压广大人民群众的滔天罪行，进一步激发了杨子荣的阶级仇恨，坚定了为群众报仇雪恨的决心。杨子荣激动地唱出了：“普天下被压迫人民都有一本血泪账，要报仇，要伸冤，血债要用血来偿”。这两句唱词，有力地表现出革命战士和被压迫人民之间崇高的深厚的阶级感情。
    《发动群众》一场，描写夹皮沟广大人民群众，由于座山雕匪徒的残害，处于水深火热之中。他们盼星星，盼月亮，盼着救星的到来。可是当小分队初到村里时，他们并不知道这就是自己日夜盼望的队伍，甚至疑虑重重。小分队遵照毛主席的教导，处处相信群众，依靠群众，和群众心连心，耐心地向群众宣传党的政策，关心群众的疾苦。他们象对待自己的亲人一样为老大娘治病。在生活十分困难的情况下，少剑波把仅有的一袋米送给老大娘。小分队还帮助群众发展了生产，组织了民兵。这一切，处处体现了人民的军队爱人民、保护人民和全心全意为人民服务的精神。这和座山雕那群匪徒残暴地镇压人民群众，正好形成了鲜明的对比。
    毛主席教导我们说：“军队须和民众打成一片，使军队在民众眼睛中看成是自己的军队，这个军队便无敌于天下”。《智取威虎山》所描写的夹皮沟的广大人民群众，在中国共产党领导下，同国民党反动派在林海雪原中，进行了一场惊心动魄的阶级斗争，取得了胜利。这和我们连队处在远离祖国大陆的偏僻小岛上，军民团结、共同对敌的战斗生活，又何等相似啊！我们连队所在的这个小岛，只有几十户人家。解放前，住在这里的渔民，象夹皮沟的群众一样，常年吃不上，穿不上，还时常被海盗抢杀掠夺。有多少渔民兄弟被迫划起小小的渔船，顶风迎浪到海上避险而被大海吞没！自从人民解放军进驻小岛后，岛上的渔民兄弟才获得了新生。现在，我们经常向渔民宣传毛泽东思想，宣传党的方针政策，关心群众的疾苦，帮助他们在岛上开荒生产，组织训练民兵。我们和《智取威虎山》中的小分队一样，想群众所想，急群众所急。今年四月份，岛上有两户渔民的房子突然失火，我们全连战士，以共产主义战士安业民为榜样，不怕烈火烧身，为渔民扑灭了大火。我们还给这两家失火的渔民送去了衣物和用具，并且和群众一起，帮助他们在废墟上建起了新瓦房。一位老大爷感动得流着眼泪说：“二十年前，这个岛上也失过火，可是那时一家失火，四邻遭殃，喊天天不应，喊地地不灵，好些人家弄得家破人亡。如今，在毛主席他老人家领导下，来了咱们自己的军队，一家失火，军民相帮，旧房变成了新房。”
    岛上的渔民群众把我们看成是自己的子弟兵。岛上天旱吃水困难，渔民就把自己平时贮存的舍不得吃的淡水，从几公里远的地方给我们送来，生动地体现了军民之间的鱼水之情。几年来，我们连就是在驻地渔民群众的大力支援下，和他们结成了政治边防和军民联防，顺利地完成了战备、训练、施工、生产等各项任务，连续七年被评为四好连队。
    《智取威虎山》是一出歌颂毛主席伟大的人民战争思想的好戏。我们决心以《智取威虎山》中的英雄们为榜样，坚决依靠人民群众，相信人民群众，保护人民群众，狠狠地打击阶级敌人。我们要在人民群众的支援下，把海岛建成红彤彤的毛泽东思想的大学校，建成坚如磐石的海上战斗堡垒。
