In the great struggle to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Cultural Revolution, the revolutionary workers of Nanchang Hongdu Mechanical Factory have resolutely implemented the great leader Chairman Mao's directive of "grasp revolution, promote production." They have insisted on using revolution to lead production, resulting in a new and vigorous scene of both revolution and production advancing in great strides.

Now, upon arriving at Hongdu Mechanical Factory, one can see a thriving scene of both revolution and production. Reports of production successes are frequently heard from all workshops, and new achievements in technological innovation and technological revolution continuously emerge. In the first half of this year, the factory's production level has been rising month by month, with the total output value in June increasing by 23% to 64% compared to January. The state plan for the first half of the year has been fully exceeded. The factory has successfully experimented with dozens of innovative projects, some of which have reached the national advanced level.

The "Sixteen Points" for the Cultural Revolution, personally drafted by the great leader Chairman Mao, states: "The Cultural Revolution is a powerful driving force for the development of productive forces in our country." Since its establishment in January this year, the factory's revolutionary committee has steadfastly implemented Chairman Mao's directive of "grasp revolution, promote production," always placing revolution first and driving the development of production. They have mobilized the masses, focused on class struggle, and conducted in-depth revolutionary criticism, fiercely criticizing the counter-revolutionary revisionist fallacies spread by China's Khrushchev and a handful of capitalist roaders within the factory, such as "business first" and "production is real, everything else is fake." They have emphasized proletarian politics. The revolutionary committees at all levels in the factory have widely mobilized the masses to launch fierce attacks on a handful of die-hard capitalist roaders and other class enemies, exposing traitors, spies, and unrepentant landlords, rich farmers, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists hidden within the revolutionary ranks. They have conducted extensive exposure, criticism, and struggle against them. This has greatly boosted the morale of the revolutionary masses, crushed the arrogance of the class enemies, deeply educated the masses, and mobilized the enthusiasm of the revolutionary workers for socialist production, powerfully promoting production.

However, a handful of class enemies are not willing to perish. They have resorted to tricks and deceit, spreading various fallacies and deliberately opposing revolution and production. Some cadres, who had previously made mistakes by not emphasizing proletarian politics, were also hesitant to lead production seriously. Facing this situation, the factory revolutionary committee organized cadres to study and discuss the great significance of Chairman Mao's directive of "grasp revolution, promote production," making them realize that doing well in production is an important part of achieving a comprehensive victory in the Cultural Revolution. At the same time, the committee deeply criticized the fallacies deliberately created by class enemies to oppose revolution and production, exposing their plot to sabotage the revolution by undermining production. This made everyone further realize that they must use revolution to lead production and produce for the revolution. With their understanding raised and concerns eliminated, the cadres boldly went among the masses to grasp revolution and promote production.

To better grasp revolution and promote production, the factory revolutionary committee held two mobilization meetings in mid-May and early July to launch a new high tide of grasping revolution and promoting production. The meetings, instead of discussing technology or setting targets, focused on class struggle within the production and technology domains, criticizing China's Khrushchev's revisionist line of managing enterprises, and organizing workshops and teams to share their experiences and insights on how to grasp revolution and promote production. The meetings turned into criticism meetings and meetings to share experiences in applying Mao Zedong Thought. Workshops and teams across the factory widely launched "one helps one" and "one red pair" competitions to learn from and help each other. Through these activities, the revolutionary workers further established the idea of using revolution to lead production and producing for the revolution. They stood firmly in their workshops but looked at the nation, increasing their sense of responsibility. Their enthusiasm for grasping revolution and promoting production reached an unprecedented height. Many revolutionary workers regarded the completion of the state plan as a matter of loyalty to Chairman Mao. The factory saw a new atmosphere where work was done without regard to time, labor was done without regard to remuneration, and heavy tasks were undertaken without regard to compensation. Many people trained themselves to be versatile, going wherever needed and helping out wherever there was a shortage. Workshops also helped and learned from each other, exchanging experiences and skills. To ensure the completion of production tasks in key workshops, other workshops sent their most capable comrades to support them, delivering materials, tools, and equipment to their doors, and dispatching small teams to help solve problems. Workshops like initial assembly and machine repair had heavy production tasks in May and faced difficulties such as labor and equipment shortages. However, the workers pooled their wisdom, worked closely together, and raced against time to overcome one difficulty after another. They not only completed the monthly plan ahead of schedule but also created new production records. The small parts machining workshop had a key component that could not be processed into qualified products using the Soviet technology. The factory's capitalist roaders insisted on not changing the original documents. Now, through revolutionary criticism, the workers have broken away from superstitions, studied diligently, and operated repeatedly, finally breaking through the technical difficulty that had not been solved for several years. With the support of the factory revolutionary committee, the workers in the painting workshop reformed the unreasonable process procedures, reducing the painting time for each product from the original 70 hours to 24 hours. By the end of May, they completed the painting task for 24 products in just three days, setting a new record since the factory's establishment.

With the emergence of the high tide of grasping revolution and promoting production, the Hongdu Mechanical Factory revolutionary committee further bravely broke away from the old management structure, conducted institutional reforms according to the principle of streamlining administration, and improving efficiency. The original production office, which was in charge of production, had a bloated structure, redundant personnel, was detached from reality, and constrained the masses' production enthusiasm. In mid-May, the factory revolutionary committee, based on the masses' demands, disbanded this institution and established a planning and dispatching group, unifying planning, dispatching, and statistics with only one-quarter of the original personnel. This strengthened the connection with the workshops and the communication of information, greatly improving work efficiency and receiving enthusiastic welcome from the workshops. Under the leadership of the factory revolutionary committee, most workshops also broke away from the overlapping institutions, merging technical, inspection, and dispatching into a streamlined production command team with only about one-quarter of the original personnel. This made it easier for the workshop revolutionary committees to manage, and the teams universally reflected that problems were solved quickly and promptly, powerfully promoting the development of production.

The good situation of grasping revolution and promoting production at Hongdu Mechanical Factory has a demonstrative and promotional effect on the socialist construction in Jiangxi Province. The provincial revolutionary committee highly evaluated the work of Hongdu Mechanical Factory and decided to hold an on-site meeting to introduce and promote their experiences.

    用革命带动生产　为革命搞好生产
    南昌洪都机械厂革命和生产出现大踏步前进的崭新局面
    新华社南昌十七日电　在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的伟大斗争中，南昌洪都机械厂广大革命职工坚决贯彻执行伟大领袖毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的方针，坚持以革命统帅生产，使全厂的革命和生产都出现了大踏步向前的崭新局面。
    现在，人们一来到洪都机械厂，就可以看到革命和生产上一派蓬蓬勃勃的景象。全厂各车间生产捷报频传，技术革新、技术革命的新成就不断涌现。今年上半年，这个厂生产水平逐月上升，一到六月总产值增长幅度达百分之二十三到百分之六十四，上半年国家计划已全面超额完成。全厂试验成功的革新项目有几十种，有的达到了全国先进水平。
    伟大领袖毛主席亲自主持制定的无产阶级文化大革命的“十六条”指出：“无产阶级文化大革命是使我国社会生产力发展的一个强大的推动力。”洪都机械厂革委会自今年一月份成立以来，坚定不移地贯彻执行毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的方针，始终把革命放在首位，推动生产的发展。他们放手发动群众，狠抓阶级斗争，持久深入地开展革命大批判，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫以及工厂党内一小撮走资派散布的“业务挂帅”、“生产好是真的，其他好是假的”等反革命修正主义谬论，大力突出无产阶级政治。全厂各级革委会广泛发动群众，主动向一小撮顽固不化的走资派等阶级敌人发起猛烈进攻，挖出了隐藏在革命队伍中的叛徒、特务以及没有改造好的地、富、反、坏、右分子，对他们进行了大揭发、大批判、大斗争。这样，就大长了无产阶级革命派的志气，大灭了阶级敌人的威风，深刻地教育了群众，调动了广大革命职工的社会主义生产积极性，有力地促进了生产。
    但是，一小撮阶级敌人并不甘心灭亡，他们又耍阴谋，施诡计，散布各种谬论，故意把革命和生产对立起来。有些干部过去因为不突出无产阶级政治犯了错误，对认真地领导生产，也有些束手束脚。针对这种情况，厂革委会组织干部认真学习和讨论了毛主席“抓革命，促生产”方针的伟大意义，使他们认识到，搞好生产是夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的一个重要组成部分。同时，革委会深刻地批判了阶级敌人故意制造的把革命与生产对立起来的谬论，揭露了他们妄图通过搞垮生产来破坏革命的阴谋，使大家进一步认识到，必须用革命统帅生产，为革命而搞好生产。干部们认识提高了，顾虑消除了，纷纷深入群众，大胆地抓革命，促生产。
    为了更好地抓革命、促生产，厂革委会在五月中和七月初，召开了两次“掀起抓革命，促生产新高潮”的动员大会。大会除把全年和季度的计划交给群众外，不谈技术，不抠指标，不压任务，而是大讲生产技术领域里的阶级斗争，大批中国赫鲁晓夫的修正主义办企业路线，组织一些车间、班组介绍狠抓革命，猛促生产的经验、体会，把生产会开成了批判会，开成了活学活用毛泽东思想的讲用会。各车间、各班组还普遍开展了“一帮一”、“一对红”的比学赶帮竞赛。通过这一系列活动，使广大革命职工进一步树立了以革命统帅生产，为革命而搞好生产的思想，他们立足车间，放眼全国，更增加了自己的责任感，抓革命、促生产的积极性空前高涨。许多革命职工把完成不完成国家计划提到忠不忠于毛主席的高度来看待。全厂出现了许多工作不计时间，劳动不计报酬，挑重担不讲价钱的新气象。许多人把自己练成多面手，那里需要就到那里突击，那个工种紧张就赶去帮忙。各车间之间还展开互帮互学，取经送宝等活动。为了保证重点车间生产任务的完成，别的车间都抽出最得力的同志到这些车间去支援，把正在用的原料、材料、工具送上门去，还派小分队去帮助解决问题。初装、机修等车间五月份生产任务很重，而且存在劳力、设备不足等困难，但全体职工群策群力，紧密协作，争分夺秒，攻破了一道道难关，不仅提前完成了月计划，还创造了生产新纪录。小件机械加工车间有一个关键零件，过去按照苏联的工艺方法，始终加工不出合格产品，而厂里的走资派却硬是规定原文资料不能改。现在职工们通过革命大批判，破除迷信，苦心钻研，反复操作，终于把几年来没有解决的技术难关一举突破了。喷漆车间的革命职工在厂革委会支持下，改革了不合理的工艺规程，每台产品喷漆时间由原来的七十小时缩短到二十四小时。五月底，他们在完成二十四台产品的喷漆任务时，只用了三天的时间，创造了建厂以来的最高纪录。
    随着抓革命、促生产高潮的出现，洪都机械厂革委会进一步勇敢地跳出原来旧管理机构的圈子，按照精兵简政的原则，进行了机构改革。厂里原来领导生产的办事机构——生产办公室，机构庞大，人浮于事，脱离实际，束缚了群众的生产积极性。五月中，厂革委会根据群众的要求，撤销了这个机构，另设了计划调度组，把计划、调度和统计统一管起来，人员只有原来的四分之一，却加强了对车间的联系和情况的沟通，工作效率大大提高，受到各车间的热烈欢迎。在厂革委会的带动下，绝大部分车间也打破了重叠的机构，把技术、检验、调度三个摊子合并，组成只有原来四分之一左右人数的精干的生产指挥班子。这样，车间革委会抓起来得心应手，班组普遍反映解决问题迅速及时，有力地推动了生产的发展。
    洪都机械厂抓革命、促生产的大好形势，对江西省社会主义建设起着示范和推动作用。省革委会对洪都机械厂的工作给予很高评价，并且决定召开现场会，介绍和推广他们的经验。
