Workers and students in Chile have been engaged in continuous struggles, supporting each other. Students in Peru have launched a mass movement demanding educational reform.

	New China News Agency, July 20th - Recently, the people of various classes in Latin American countries such as Chile, Peru, and Ecuador have been continuously launching mass struggles against U.S. imperialist aggression, against the exploitation by the local big landlords and big bourgeoisie, and demanding educational reform.

	In Chile, where U.S. capital has heavily infiltrated, workers, peasants, and students have been engaged in waves of struggles, supporting and echoing each other. On the 19th, five thousand state-owned railway workers in the capital Santiago and San Bernardo staged a strike to support the three thousand electricians in the same railway system who were striking for a wage increase. On the same day, more than ten thousand employees from thirty-two banks across Chile went on strike to support the employees of the Osorno-La Unión Bank, the Israelita Bank, and the Commercial Bank who were striking for higher wages. The bosses of these three banks are big capitalists and landlords linked to U.S. monopolies. Meanwhile, one hundred employees of the Chilean Ministry of Education also began a three-day strike, strongly demanding that the authorities improve their deteriorating economic situation.

	Eighty farmers from the Colchagua province of Chile arrived in the capital Santiago a few days ago and occupied the garden of the parliament to protest against the so-called "land reform" plan implemented by the Chilean authorities. At the same time, more than one hundred agricultural workers in the estates near Los Andes have been on strike for over a month, defying the threats of armed police.

	On the 18th, a group of Chilean youth students held a demonstration in the center of Santiago, protesting against U.S. imperialist aggression in Vietnam and the police's suppression of the masses. This was the second such demonstration in a week. The students fought with armed police using stones. Many unions expressed their protest against the police's suppression of students and supported the students' struggle.

	Students from the Cantuta University near the Peruvian capital Lima continued their struggle against the reduction of educational funds. On the 14th, they broke through police suppression to hold a demonstration and occupied the university. To protest against the authorities' suppression, the students intercepted a train carrying oil for the U.S.-owned Cerro de Pasco Corporation on the 16th. On the 19th, they again occupied the National Library in the center of Lima. Residents of Arequipa, the capital of the Arequipa province in Peru, held a demonstration on the 18th to protest against the rise in living costs. Demonstrators also threw two Molotov cocktails at the provincial headquarters of the ruling party, the People's Action Party. Students from the medical department of the San Agustín University in Arequipa also occupied the medical department on the 19th, demanding educational reform. Two thousand teachers in the Guayas province of Ecuador held a demonstration in Guayaquil, the largest city in Ecuador, on the 18th, demanding the payment of overdue wages and protesting against the unjust dismissal of teachers.

    秘鲁学生掀起要求教育改革的群众性斗争
    新华社二十日讯　拉丁美洲智利、秘鲁和厄瓜多尔各阶层人民，最近不断掀起反对美帝国主义侵略、反抗本国大地主和大资产阶级的剥削、要求教育改革的群众性斗争。
    在被美国资本大量渗透的智利，最近以来工人、农民、学生的斗争此伏彼起，互相支援，互相呼应。首都圣地亚哥和圣贝尔纳多两个城市的五千名国营铁路工人，十九日举行罢工，表示声援这一铁路系统的三千名电工为要求增加工资而举行的罢工斗争。同一天，智利全国三十二家银行的一万多名职员举行罢工，支持奥索尔诺—拉乌尼翁银行、伊斯拉埃利塔银行和工商银行的职员为要求提高工资而进行的罢工斗争。这三家银行的老板都是一些同美国垄断集团有联系的大资本家和大地主。同时，智利教育部一百名职员也开始了三天的罢工，强烈要求当局改善他们越来越坏的经济处境。
    智利科尔查瓜省的八十名农民几天前到达首都圣地亚哥，进驻议会的花园，表示反对智利当局推行的所谓“土地改革”计划。同时，在洛斯安第斯市附近一些庄园里工作的一百多名农业工人，不顾武装警察的威吓，已经坚持罢工一个多月。
    十八日，一批智利青年学生在圣地亚哥市中心举行示威游行，抗议美帝国主义侵略越南，抗议警察镇压群众的暴行。这是一星期之内发生的第二次这样的示威。学生们用石块同前来镇压的武装警察进行搏斗。许多工会都表示抗议警察对学生的镇压，支持学生的斗争。
    秘鲁首都利马附近的坎图塔大学的学生继续为反对削减教育经费而进行斗争。他们在十四日冲破警察的镇压举行示威，并且占领了这所大学。为了抗议当局的镇压，学生们在十六日拦截了一列为美资塞罗德帕斯科公司运送石油的火车。十九日，他们又一度占领了利马市中心的国家图书馆。秘鲁阿雷基帕省首府阿雷基帕市的居民十八日举行示威游行，抗议生活费用上涨。示威者还向执政党人民行动党的省党部投掷两枚燃烧弹。阿雷基帕市圣奥古斯丁大学医疗系的学生十九日也占领了医疗系，要求进行教育改革。厄瓜多尔瓜亚斯省的两千名教师十八日在厄瓜多尔第一大城市瓜亚基尔举行示威游行，要求支付拖欠的工资，反对无理解雇教师。
