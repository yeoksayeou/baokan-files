A new victory for Chairman Mao's policy of "ancient for present use, foreign for Chinese use" has been achieved. The broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers highly praise the piano-accompanied singing of "The Red Lantern."

The flower cultivated by Comrade Jiang Qing, which radiates the brilliant light of Chairman Mao's great thoughts on art and literature, sings out the fearless revolutionary spirit of the proletariat. It has once again struck a heavy blow to the counter-revolutionary revisionist literary line of China's Khrushchev, opened a new chapter in the art of the piano, and blazed a new trail in theatrical accompaniment.

The New China News Agency reported on the 11th that workers, peasants, and soldiers across the country, who are striving for a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, are eagerly listening to the piano-accompanied singing of "The Red Lantern" and enthusiastically hailing the new victory of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line in literature and art. The broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers are extremely excited and praise it highly, saying that this new variety of proletarian revolutionary literature and art, cultivated by Comrade Jiang Qing, is another flower radiating the brilliant light of Chairman Mao's great thoughts on art and literature. It is another triumphant song of Mao Zedong Thought, inspiring people to advance victoriously. It is another fruitful achievement of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution on the literary and artistic front. The broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers enthusiastically shout: Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought! Long live Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line!

Our great teacher and leader, Chairman Mao, and his close comrade-in-arms, Vice Chairman Lin Biao, personally watched and listened to the performance of this flower of proletarian revolutionary literature and art as soon as it bloomed. They also received the revolutionary literary and artistic warriors who participated in the performance. This is the greatest concern and encouragement for the revolutionary literary and artistic warriors, and also the greatest concern and encouragement for the hundreds of millions of revolutionary masses across the country. People from all over the country and revolutionary literary and artistic warriors, with hearts full of joy, wish our great leader, Chairman Mao, a long life! A long life! They said excitedly that Chairman Mao is most concerned about and supports the new things of the proletariat and most respects the pioneering spirit of the revolutionary masses. We must, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, strive to the utmost, strive to be the best, fully display our revolutionary initiative and creativity, and strive for new and great victories on all fronts!

The great leader, Chairman Mao, teaches us: "To make literature and art a component part of the whole revolutionary machine, as a powerful weapon for uniting the people, educating the people, attacking the enemy, and annihilating the enemy, to help the people unite as one and fight against the enemy." In recent days, revolutionary masses across the country have listened to the live broadcast of the piano-accompanied singing of "The Red Lantern" in the capital. Many people listened to it over and over again, becoming more and more excited and more and more enthusiastic. Many people sang along as they listened. Many people, after listening, used Li Yuhe's unyielding spirit in the face of the enemy to fiercely criticize the traitor philosophy of China's Khrushchev and the shameful crimes of the traitors unearthed in their own units, launching a more fierce attack on a handful of class enemies. Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's great thought of "ancient for present use, foreign for Chinese use," the piano-accompanied singing of "The Red Lantern" more vividly and vividly depicts the image of the proletarian hero, fully playing the great role of revolutionary literature and art in uniting the people, educating the people, and attacking the enemy. Workers, peasants, and soldiers in the capital and many other places excitedly said that the piano-accompanied singing of "The Red Lantern" sings out the voice of the proletariat and the fearless revolutionary spirit of the proletariat. The lofty images of Li Yuhe and Li Tiemei are alive before our eyes, arousing our class hatred and national resentment, greatly inspiring our fighting spirit against class enemies, and inspiring our determination to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!

"In the present world, all culture or literature and art belong to a certain class and a certain political line." While listening to the piano-accompanied singing of "The Red Lantern," the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers in various places reviewed Chairman Mao's teaching and enthusiastically hailed the birth of the piano-accompanied singing of "The Red Lantern" as a brilliant achievement of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao. It is a major victory of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line in literature and art. It has once again struck a heavy blow to the counter-revolutionary revisionist literary line of China's Khrushchev, pronounced the death sentence on the decaying and declining piano art ruled by the bourgeoisie, opened a new chapter in the art of the piano, and blazed a new trail in the accompaniment of national theater. Revolutionary workers on the Shanghai Railway Bureau's Songjiang line excitedly said that Comrade Jiang Qing, who holds high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, led revolutionary literary and artistic warriors to bravely carry out the revolution. After creating eight revolutionary model operas, she created another new variety of revolutionary literature and art, the piano-accompanied singing of "The Red Lantern." She successfully turned the piano art, which had long served the bourgeoisie, into a tool serving us workers, peasants, and soldiers. It greatly boosted the morale of the revolutionary people and crushed the arrogance of the imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries. It fully proved that the Chinese people armed with Mao Zedong Thought are not only good at destroying an old world but also good at building a new world! The soldiers of the "Good Eighth Company on Nanjing Road" excitedly said that the birth of the piano-accompanied singing of "The Red Lantern" is a stunning artistic achievement that shocks the world. It is like a sharp dagger piercing the hearts of class enemies at home and abroad. Workers at the Changsha Low-Voltage Electrical Appliance Factory said that in the past, China's Khrushchev and his agents, who promoted the counter-revolutionary revisionist literary line, monopolized the stage and poisoned us with bourgeois and revisionist so-called art. It is Chairman Mao's revolutionary line in literature and art that has brought us such a good program as the piano-accompanied singing of "The Red Lantern." We workers applaud the appearance of this new variety of proletarian revolutionary literature and art!

"Our literature and art are for the people, primarily for the workers, peasants, and soldiers, created for the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and used by the workers, peasants, and soldiers." In factories, mines, ports, docks, fields, and barracks, the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers eagerly listen to the piano-accompanied singing of "The Red Lantern" over and over again, full of passion, enthusiastically hailing the new victory of Chairman Mao's great policy that literature and art should serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers. Revolutionary workers at the Jinan Machine Tool Factory No. 1 excitedly said while listening to the piano-accompanied singing of "The Red Lantern": Good! Good! Good! The piano has also started to serve us workers, peasants, and soldiers, serving proletarian politics! We workers, peasants, and soldiers love such revolutionary literature and art the most, love to watch it, love to listen to it, and understand it. The piano-accompanied singing of "The Red Lantern" vividly depicts the glorious image of the working class and sings out the revolutionary enthusiasm of the working class in a passionate and stirring manner. As we listen, it seems as if Li Yuhe and Li Tiemei are among us, fighting firmly against class enemies with us. Such revolutionary literature and art, we must welcome with both hands! Labor model Li Shucheng of Shandong Province excitedly said that in recent days, the radio has continuously broadcasted the piano-accompanied singing of "The Red Lantern." I have listened carefully, and it is truly moving and inspiring. I applaud it a thousand times and cheer for it ten thousand times! It is good because it plays out the revolutionary enthusiasm of the laboring people and sings out the strong will of revolutionary heroes; it is good because the melody is that of the workers, peasants, and soldiers, lively and spirited, genuine and real; it is good because it embodies Chairman Mao's brilliant thought of "ancient for present use, foreign for Chinese use," giving the piano art a great revolution. The piano art, which used to serve only the bourgeoisie, has now begun to walk on the broad road of serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers. The success of the piano-accompanied singing of "The Red Lantern" makes us feel more deeply the greatness, wisdom, and correctness of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line in literature and art. Deputy Director Li Suwen of the Shenyang Revolutionary Committee said that Li Yuhe, accompanied by the piano, has a more towering image. He fights against the enemy on stage, and we are filled with indignation off stage. It is truly a united heart on and off stage! Colonel Song Kongguang of a certain regiment in the Nanjing Military Region said that the piano-accompanied singing of "The Red Lantern" fully reflects the thoughts and feelings of the workers, peasants, and soldiers, making this Western instrument serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers and proletarian politics for the first time in history, becoming an artistic form that we workers, peasants, and soldiers love to hear and see. Listening to such music is like having the hero in front of us, greatly inspiring our revolutionary fighting spirit. We workers, peasants, and soldiers love such music and art, and we must enthusiastically applaud the piano-accompanied singing of "The Red Lantern"!

The broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, while listening to the piano-accompanied singing of "The Red Lantern" over and over again, enthusiastically hailed this innovation in the history of world art as a victory in seriously implementing Chairman Mao's great policy of "foreign for Chinese use, pushing the old to make way for the new." National agricultural labor model and Deputy Director Rao Xingli of the Hubei Revolutionary Committee listened to the piano-accompanied singing of "The Red Lantern" and was deeply moved. He said that in the past, the piano was monopolized by the bourgeoisie's masters, madams, young masters, and young ladies, playing only foreign tunes and accompanying only foreign voices. We poor and lower-middle peasants felt nauseated when we heard it. Now, listening to the piano-accompanied singing of "The Red Lantern," we poor and lower-middle peasants love it more and more, feel more and more spirited, and our revolutionary fighting spirit and production enthusiasm grow stronger and stronger. We firmly believe that under the leadership of Comrade Jiang Qing, our revolutionary literary and artistic warriors will further implement Chairman Mao's great policy of "ancient for present use, foreign for Chinese use" and continue to create more new proletarian revolutionary literature and art that the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers love to hear and see. Deputy Director Jia Jincai of the Dazhai Production Brigade said that in the past, when we heard that foreign piano on the radio, it played nothing but bourgeois foreign stuff, soft and sour, really disgusting. But some people said it was "high-level" art. What "high-level" art, it's completely bourgeois trash. Now we have overthrown these bourgeois arts and used this foreign instrument, the piano, to serve the performance of revolutionary modern plays. It's really great! Comrade Pang Chaosheng, a former comrade-in-arms of the late "Model of Supporting the Left and Loving the People" Li Wentong and a first-class hero, was deeply moved after listening to the broadcast. He said that we revolutionary soldiers love to listen to the piano-accompanied singing of "The Red Lantern" and firmly support this great innovation in the history of world art. The successful birth of the piano-accompanied singing of "The Red Lantern" tells people that some "ancient" and "foreign" art forms, after being transformed with Mao Zedong Thought, pushing the old to make way for the new, and serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers, will be full of new vitality. Ballet is like this, and the ancient Beijing opera and the Western instrument, the piano, are also like this.

Revolutionary literary and artistic warriors in various places, while enthusiastically hailing the brilliant flower of proletarian revolutionary literature and art—the piano-accompanied singing of "The Red Lantern," further studied and deeply understood Chairman Mao's great thoughts on literature and art, receiving great education and encouragement. They resolutely declared that they would take Comrade Jiang Qing as a shining example, humbly and seriously learn from the revolutionary literary and artistic warriors in the capital, hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, fiercely criticize the counter-revolutionary revisionist literary line promoted by China's Khrushchev and his agents, thoroughly eliminate its poison, and in the struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines, better study and apply Mao Zedong Thought in practice, and strive for the creation and development of our country's new proletarian revolutionary literature and art to the end!

    伟大领袖毛主席教导说：“要使文艺很好地成为整个革命机器的一个组成部分，作为团结人民、教育人民、打击敌人、消灭敌人的有力的武器，帮助人民同心同德地和敌人作斗争。”连日来，全国各地广大革命群众收听了钢琴伴唱《红灯记》在首都演出的实况转播。许多人听了一遍又听一遍，越听越高兴，越听越起劲。许多人一边听，一边跟着唱了起来。许多人收听以后，就用李玉和在敌人面前坚贞不屈的革命精神，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫的叛徒哲学，狠批本单位挖出的叛徒的可耻罪行，向一小撮阶级敌人展开更加猛烈的进攻。在毛主席的“古为今用，洋为中用”伟大思想指引下诞生的钢琴伴唱《红灯记》，更加丰满、更加生动地刻画了无产阶级的英雄形象，充分发挥了革命文艺团结人民、教育人民、打击敌人的巨大作用。首都和许多地方的工农兵群众兴奋地说，钢琴伴唱《红灯记》唱出了无产阶级的心声，唱出了无产阶级大无畏的革命气魄。李玉和和李铁梅的高大英雄形象活现在我们眼前，激起了我们的阶级仇、民族恨，大大鼓舞了我们向阶级敌人进攻的斗志，鼓舞了我们把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底的决心！
      “在现在世界上，一切文化或文学艺术都是属于一定的阶级，属于一定的政治路线的。”各地工农兵群众在喜听钢琴伴唱《红灯记》的时候，重温毛主席的这一教导，热烈欢呼钢琴伴唱《红灯记》的诞生，是毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命的辉煌成果，是毛主席的革命文艺路线的重大胜利，它又一次沉重地打击了中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义文艺黑线，宣判了资产阶级统治着的腐朽没落的钢琴艺术的死刑，揭开了钢琴艺术崭新的一页，开辟了祖国戏剧伴奏的新道路。上海铁路分局松江线路上的革命职工激动地说，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗的江青同志，带领革命文艺战士，勇敢地进行革命，继创造出八个革命样板戏之后，又创造出了钢琴伴唱《红灯记》这一革命文艺新品种，成功地把一向为资产阶级服务的钢琴艺术变成了为我们工农兵服务的工具，大长了革命人民的志气，大灭了帝修反的威风，充分证明了用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民“不但善于破坏一个旧世界”，也“善于建设一个新世界”！“南京路上好八连”的指战员们兴奋地说，钢琴伴唱《红灯记》的诞生，是震惊中外的艺术成就，它象一把锋利的匕首，刺向了国内外阶级敌人的心脏。长沙低压电器厂的工人们说，过去，中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人所推行的反革命修正主义文艺黑线，在舞台上专了我们的政，用资产阶级和修正主义的所谓艺术毒害我们。是毛主席的革命文艺路线，给我们送来了钢琴伴唱《红灯记》这样的好节目。我们工人为这一无产阶级革命文艺新品种的出现拍手叫好！
      “我们的文学艺术都是为人民大众的，首先是为工农兵的，为工农兵而创作，为工农兵所利用的。”在工厂矿山，在海港码头，在村头地边，在操场营房，广大工农兵群众争先恐后地一遍又一遍收听钢琴伴唱《红灯记》，满怀激情地热烈欢呼毛主席的文艺要为工农兵服务的伟大方针的新胜利。济南机床一厂的广大革命职工在收听钢琴伴唱《红灯记》的时候，边听边激动地说：好！好！好！钢琴也开始为我们工农兵服务了，为无产阶级政治服务了！这样的革命文艺，我们工农兵最爱看，最爱听，也看得懂，听得真。钢琴伴唱《红灯记》，活龙活现地表现了工人阶级的光辉形象，激昂慷慨地唱出了工人阶级的革命豪情。我们听着听着，就好象李玉和、李铁梅在我们中间，和我们一起同阶级敌人坚决战斗。这样的革命文艺，我们就是要双手欢迎！山东省农业劳动模范李树诚激动地说，最近几天，电台连续广播钢琴伴唱《红灯记》，俺都细心收听，真是声声入耳，句句动心，俺为它一千个欢呼，一万个叫好！它好就好在弹出了劳动人民的革命豪情，唱出了革命英雄的坚强意志；好就好在腔是工农兵的腔，调是工农兵的调，响亮带劲，实实在在；好就好在它体现了毛主席“古为今用，洋为中用”的光辉思想，使钢琴艺术来了一个大革命。原来只为资产阶级服务的钢琴艺术，现在开始走上了为工农兵服务的广阔道路。钢琴伴唱《红灯记》的成功，使我们更深刻地感到毛主席革命文艺路线的无比伟大，无比英明，无比正确。沈阳市革委会副主任李素文说，用钢琴烘托的李玉和，英雄形象更高大，他和我们心连心。台上与敌斗争，台下义愤填膺，真是台上台下一条心！南京部队某团团长宋孔广说，钢琴伴唱《红灯记》充分反映了工农兵的思想感情，使这个西洋乐器在历史上第一次为工农兵服务，为无产阶级政治服务，成为我们工农兵喜闻乐见的艺术形式。听了这样的音乐，好象英雄就在面前，大大激励了我们的革命斗志。我们工农兵就是喜欢这样的音乐艺术，就是要满腔热情地高声为钢琴伴唱《红灯记》叫好！
    广大工农兵群众在一遍又一遍收听钢琴伴唱《红灯记》的时候，热烈欢呼世界艺术史上的这一创举，是认真贯彻执行毛主席的“洋为中用、推陈出新”伟大方针的胜利。全国农业劳动模范、湖北省革命委员会副主任饶兴礼同志听了钢琴伴唱《红灯记》，十分激动地说，过去钢琴一直为资产阶级的老爷太太少爷小姐们所垄断，尽弹洋曲子，专伴洋嗓子，我们贫下中农一听就恶心。现在听钢琴伴唱《红灯记》，我们贫下中农越听越爱听，越听越带劲，越听革命斗志越旺盛，越听生产干劲越大。我们坚决相信，在江青同志的率领下，我们的无产阶级革命文艺战士一定会进一步贯彻执行毛主席“古为今用，洋为中用”的伟大方针，继续创造出更多的为工农兵群众喜闻乐见的无产阶级革命新文艺。大寨大队贫协主任贾进才说，过去在广播里听到那个洋钢琴，尽弹的是一些资产阶级的洋东西，软绵绵，酸溜溜，实在讨厌，可有人还说是“高级”艺术。什么“高级”艺术，完全是资产阶级的臭玩意儿。现在把这些资产阶级的艺术打倒了，用钢琴这个洋乐器来为表演革命现代戏服务，真是好得很！“支左爱民模范”李文忠同志生前战友、一等功臣庞朝胜听了广播以后，心情一直非常激动。他说，我们革命战士非常爱听钢琴伴唱《红灯记》，坚决支持这个在世界文艺史上的伟大创举。钢琴伴唱《红灯记》的胜利诞生告诉人们：有些“古”的、“洋”的艺术形式，经过用毛泽东思想加以改造，推陈出新，为工农兵服务，就会富有新的生命力。芭蕾舞是这样，古老的京剧和西洋乐器钢琴，也同样是这样。
    各地革命文艺战士在热烈欢呼无产阶级革命文艺光彩夺目的鲜花——钢琴伴唱《红灯记》诞生的时候，进一步学习和深刻领会毛主席的伟大文艺思想，受到了极大的教育和鼓舞。他们坚决表示，一定要以江青同志为光辉榜样，虚心地、认真地向首都革命文艺战士学习，更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人推行的反革命修正主义文艺黑线，彻底肃清其流毒，在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争中更好地活学活用毛泽东思想，为创造和发展我国无产阶级革命新文艺而奋斗到底！
