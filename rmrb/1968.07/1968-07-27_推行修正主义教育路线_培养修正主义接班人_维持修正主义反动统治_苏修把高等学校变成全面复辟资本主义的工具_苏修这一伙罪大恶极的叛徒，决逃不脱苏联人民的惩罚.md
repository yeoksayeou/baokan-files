The revisionist educational line is being promoted, revisionist successors are being cultivated, and the reactionary rule of revisionism is being maintained. The Soviet revisionists have turned higher education into a tool for the comprehensive restoration of capitalism. This gang of heinous traitors will not escape the punishment of the Soviet people.

Editor's Note: Education is a tool of class struggle. In capitalist society, the bourgeoisie always uses education to cultivate their servants and successors to maintain their rule. After the proletariat seizes power, education remains an important battlefield for the struggle between two classes and two lines. The proletariat, in order to consolidate its power, must thoroughly smash the bourgeois educational system and make education serve proletarian politics. As Lenin pointed out long ago, "Schools should become a tool of proletarian dictatorship."

The Soviet revisionist clique has betrayed proletarian dictatorship and implemented bourgeois dictatorship. Therefore, they must promote a set of revisionist educational lines and systems. They allow a large number of bourgeois academic authorities to control the schools, instill decadent bourgeois ideology in the schools, corrupt and poison the younger generation, and turn the schools into places for cultivating revisionist successors. They provide the children of the bourgeois privileged class with various superior conditions, while discriminating against and excluding the children of workers and peasants. All of these are for the comprehensive restoration of capitalism and the maintenance of bourgeois dictatorship.

Today, this newspaper publishes a report from Xinhua News Agency that exposes in detail the heinous crimes of the Soviet revisionist clique in the field of education. From this negative example, one can more deeply understand the great significance of the proletariat seizing power and carrying out an educational revolution, smashing the bourgeois educational system, and maintaining proletarian dictatorship to prevent the restoration of capitalism.

Xinhua News Agency, July 26th: The Soviet revisionist leadership, in order to adapt to their need for the comprehensive restoration of capitalism, has implemented a set of bourgeois school management policies and revisionist educational lines in the field of education. They have turned higher education into an important venue for peddling revisionist ideology, using various means to corrupt and poison the younger generation, cultivating spiritual aristocrats and revisionist successors, and maintaining the reactionary rule of the bourgeois privileged class.

Cultivating Spiritual Aristocrats

The struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie on the educational front is concentrated on the issue of serving which class's politics and cultivating successors for which class.

Great Lenin pointed out: Soviet education should "carry on the cause that began with the October Revolution of 1917, turning schools from tools of bourgeois class rule into tools for destroying such rule and completely eliminating social class divisions. Schools should become tools of proletarian dictatorship."

Great Leader Chairman Mao pointed out: "Education must serve proletarian politics and must be combined with productive labor. The working people should become intellectualized, and intellectuals should become laborized." "Our educational policy should enable those who receive education to develop in moral, intellectual, and physical education, becoming laborers with socialist consciousness and culture."

The Soviet revisionist leadership has completely betrayed Marxism-Leninism, betrayed proletarian dictatorship, and betrayed the socialist cause. This gang of traitors, after seizing party and state power, has brazenly used the educational front to serve their comprehensive restoration of capitalism.

The revisionists implement the old bourgeois line of "those who think rule over those who labor." Soviet leader Brezhnev boasts that they "recruit cadres from experts trained in higher education to engage in economic work, party work, state work, diplomatic work, military work, and all social activities." Another Soviet leader, Kosygin, advocates that higher education should cultivate "experts and production organizers." In reality, they want to cultivate revisionists who are detached from proletarian politics, detached from the workers and peasants, and detached from production practice, who are full of bourgeois worldviews, and who stand above the laboring people to maintain and consolidate the rule of revisionism.

The Soviet revisionist leadership vigorously promotes the bourgeois policy of "experts running schools," allowing bourgeois academic authorities and reactionary "academic authorities" to control the power of higher education, monopolize everything, and poison the youth with various reactionary ideas at will.

In teaching, the revisionists inject a large amount of revisionist poison into students, strengthen ideological control, and make the youth detached from proletarian politics. They use the banner of communism to peddle capitalist goods. They madly oppose Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, viciously attack proletarian dictatorship and the socialist system, and advocate the revisionist line of "class struggle extinction" and "three harmonies and two fulls," promoting bourgeois selfishness, pacifism, and humanitarianism. They force students to accept these reactionary ideas through indoctrination, examinations, and other means, and threaten that those who lack a clear understanding of the revisionist "policy" cannot become good Soviet experts.

The revisionist clique also vigorously promotes the bourgeois line of "intellectual education first," forcing students to spend all day in books, becoming "book-reciting machines." The Soviet leaders shout hoarsely, "The basic social function of students is: to attend classes, to practice in teaching and experimental laboratories, to read, and to enrich themselves with modern scientific knowledge."

An article published in the Soviet "Truth" newspaper on January 8th this year revealed the tedious and heavy course schedule set for students by the revisionists. The author of the article said, "I have encountered all kinds of university students. Some are talented, some are not so talented, some are diligent, and some are a bit lazy. But none of them can complete all the courses prescribed in the teaching plan in a few semesters. Not even one semester!" According to the school's course schedule, "students should spend 107 hours per week. And there are only 144 hours in a week. In other words, adding up eating, sleeping, walking, watching movies, physical activities, etc., they only have 6 hours a day!" The author of the article also revealed that now the students of higher education are busy running around to cope with various exams, "This is not about cultivating students' scientific beliefs, because they simply do not have time to critically think about the teachers' views."

The revisionist clique boasts about the "great achievements" of their higher education institutions in cultivating technical "experts" in industry and agriculture, but some materials revealed by Soviet publications have exposed their bluffs.

An article titled "On the Issue of Cultivating University Students into Engineers" published in the Soviet "Truth" newspaper said that in the past seven years, the "engineers" trained by the higher education institutions in Leningrad cannot handle actual work in factory enterprises. The article revealed that "among the reasons, the mistakes of the higher education institutions themselves occupy a considerable position." "Many professional teaching and research groups of teachers have incomplete industrial knowledge and only one-sided professional knowledge... Most teachers have not participated in actual production; they all became teachers through the old path of elementary school-university-graduate school."

"The graduates of higher technical schools currently lack knowledge in industrial procedures, economics, and the organization and management of production," "their technical and economic analysis capabilities are very poor... they cannot argue for the engineering schemes adopted," and their production knowledge is "intolerably scarce."

An article titled "Ineffective Experts" published in the Soviet "Truth" newspaper on January 16th revealed that the "agronomists and veterinarians" graduated from agricultural colleges and agricultural academies are "unqualified," and many of them do not want to go to the countryside. "A large number of experts are working in units and production departments that have nothing to do with agriculture," "many young agricultural experts remain in the cities."

Promoting the Idea of Fame and Wealth

The Soviet revisionist clique uses every means to corrupt the younger generation with bourgeois ideas of fame, wealth, status, and enjoyment, turning the youth into genuine revisionists to inherit their legacy.

The revisionists loudly advocate that "seeking knowledge is for profit, and receiving education is for making money." They have taken many measures to promote "material incentives" and encourage students to pursue fame and wealth.

In the Soviet Union, students' scholarships and stipends are given based on grades, with higher grades receiving more money and lower grades receiving less or even having their scholarships withheld. After obtaining a university diploma, one can become a "cadre," "expert," "engineer," "manager," etc., and thus earn more than ordinary laborers. After graduating from university, some can continue to be graduate students. After graduating from graduate school and obtaining a doctoral degree, fame and wealth immediately increase. With just a doctoral title, one can earn an additional 170 rubles per month, and with other additional incomes from positions, it will be even more. Later, one can gradually climb up the pyramid: doctoral associate—doctor—corresponding academician—academician. And becoming an academician means becoming a great authority and a wealthy tycoon.

The revisionist traitors also vigorously promote the bourgeois culture and Western lifestyle under the banner of "developing individuality" and "cultivating interests" among the youth, advocating pleasure-seeking and personal enjoyment. Things like strange clothes, weird hairstyles, jazz music, twist dancing, cafes, nightclubs, pornographic films, nude paintings, reactionary novels, etc., are all the "modern" things that revisionists advocate for the youth to be interested in.

The revisionists' retrogressive actions have seriously damaged the socialist culture and communist moral standards nurtured by the October Revolution; the foul air of bourgeois ideology is seriously poisoning the younger generation.

According to a recent revelation by the Soviet "Banner of Lenin" newspaper, in the Moscow Commercial College, the children of the privileged class, relying on their parents' power and money, indulge in drinking and entertainment, roam cafes, bully and even commit murder. "Hoodlums, drunks, and idlers" have "solidly built a nest of comfort," running amok. The student dormitories have become markets for selling imported goods and making profits through speculation. Evil winds are spreading, and the entire commercial college is "enveloped in a sense of fear."

Under the poisoning of revisionism, many young people are indifferent to the plight of the laboring people, the future of the country, and the world revolution, and only pursue personal fame and wealth. In a report on a discussion about "happiness" among university students published in the Soviet "Truth of the Komsomol," it was advocated that some young people's life goals are to become "experts, masters of their field, then marry a wife, have children"; some hope to obtain "countless money," "to add everything necessary for themselves"; some only like to "go to the bay in the morning," and in the evening go to "cafes" and movie theaters; some like "long, messy hair"; some want to "live in a dream"; and some want to "live in the 17th to 18th century" to be "pirates." From the views on happiness and life goals of some young people praised by this newspaper, one can clearly see that the revisionist traitors have led many Soviet youth to a very dangerous situation.

Discriminating Against the Children of Workers and Peasants

In today's Soviet education, there is a clear disparity between the rich and the poor. On the one hand, the children of the bourgeois privileged class enjoy various superior conditions and do as they please, flying high; on the other hand, the children of workers and peasants and laboring youth suffer discrimination and attacks.

The revisionist clique advocates that the only standard for admitting new students to higher education and expelling university students is knowledge, ability, examinations, and grades, and that knowledge is the "highest arbiter," etc. In fact, the children of the privileged class, due to their superior material conditions, naturally find it easier to obtain examination grades to enter higher education. Moreover, even if their academic performance is poor, they can still sneak into the university through various means of bribery and cheating to obtain a diploma and a desirable position.

However, the children of the working people and laboring youth are in a completely different situation. An article published in the Soviet "Philosophical Problems" magazine admitted that in the Soviet Union, "due to differences in family material conditions, parents' education level, and place of residence," young people's "opportunities for education are different." According to the author of the article, in the Novosibirsk region, the children of Soviet party and state cadres and high-income freelancers have 82% who can continue to higher education after graduating from high school; while the children of "agricultural workers" have very few who can continue their studies. The article revealed that the trend of "reducing the proportion of workers and peasants entering higher education" is further developing.

Even if some children of the working people enter higher education, they may be expelled at any time. The scholarships of the schools are given based on "grades," not on the economic situation of the students' families. The children of the privileged class, due to their money and power, can obtain high grades through various means of bribery and cheating. While many children of the working people have to work part-time to maintain their lives and cannot concentrate on exams, often losing their scholarships. Many people are thus expelled from school because of "poor grades."

A student from a poor family at Moscow University has family burdens. He has to go out to do "odd jobs" after class every day and returns home at nine or ten in the evening to earn a little money to maintain his life. During the winter and summer vacations, he also goes to do heavy physical labor to prepare for the expenses of the next semester.

A son of a collective farm member was admitted to the Chemical Engineering Institute, but the scholarship could not maintain his life. He found a job as a telephone operator at the telephone bureau, working continuously for 48 hours from Saturday to Sunday every week. He has a heart condition and collapses on the bed after each shift, unable to get up.

Electrician Sasha is already over 30 years old and has worked for more than 10 years, with a monthly salary of only over 80 rubles. After being admitted to a higher education institution, his own scholarship plus his wife's salary and his elderly mother's pension is not enough for the living expenses of his family of four. Sasha has to frequently go to the hospital to sell blood.

According to an article published in the Soviet "Soviet Russia" newspaper, in recent years, "the number of people expelled from various higher education institutions in the Soviet Union has increased," and the number of people expelled from Ural University in the past five years has almost doubled, with "most of them having work experience." "The number of students expelled from the Mechanics and Mathematics Department accounts for one-quarter of the enrolled students," and many people are expelled due to "material reasons," "family conditions," etc.

Soviet publications openly cheer for the heinous crimes of higher education institutions in excluding young workers and peasants and the children of workers and peasants, shouting in the tone of bourgeois lords that allowing "doormen, clerks, salespeople, etc." to enter the university is "nonsense." They also slander laboring youth as "people who are neither capable nor willing to dedicate themselves to science."

The heinous crimes of the revisionist traitor clique have aroused the strong indignation of the Soviet people. This gang of heinous traitors will not escape the punishment they deserve.

    推行修正主义教育路线　培养修正主义接班人  　维持修正主义反动统治
    苏修把高等学校变成全面复辟资本主义的工具
    苏修这一伙罪大恶极的叛徒，决逃不脱苏联人民的惩罚
    编者按：教育是阶级斗争的工具。在资本主义社会里，资产阶级总是通过教育来培养他们的奴仆和接班人，以维持它的统治。无产阶级夺取政权以后，教育仍然是两个阶级、两条道路斗争的一个重要阵地。无产阶级为了巩固自己的政权，必须彻底摧毁资产阶级教育制度，使教育为无产阶级政治服务。正如列宁早已指出的，“学校应当成为无产阶级专政的工具”。
    苏修叛徒集团背叛无产阶级专政，实行资产阶级专政。因此，他们必然要在教育方面推行一整套修正主义的教育路线和教育制度。他们让大批资产阶级学阀统治学校，在学校里灌输腐朽的资产阶级思想，腐蚀和毒害青年一代，把学校变为培养修正主义接班人的场所。他们使资产阶级特权阶层的子弟享有种种优越条件，而对工农子弟加以歧视和排斥。所有这些，都是为全面复辟资本主义，为维护资产阶级专政服务的。
    本报今天发表的新华社的这篇报道，用大量事实揭露了苏修叛徒集团在教育领域中大搞反革命复辟的罪恶行径。人们从这个反面教材中，可以更深刻地认识到，无产阶级掌握政权之后，实行教育革命，破除资产阶级教育制度，这对于维护无产阶级专政、防止资本主义复辟有着多么重大的意义。
    新华社二十六日讯　本社记者述评：苏修领导集团为适应其全面复辟资本主义的需要，在教育方面推行一整套资产阶级的办校方针和修正主义的教育路线。他们把高等学校作为贩卖修正主义思想的重要场所，采取各种方式腐蚀和毒害青年一代，培养精神贵族和修正主义的接班人，维持资产阶级特权阶层的反动统治。
        培养精神贵族
    无产阶级同资产阶级在教育战线上的斗争，集中地表现在为哪个阶级的政治服务，为哪个阶级培养接班人的问题上。
    伟大的列宁曾经指出：苏维埃教育，要“把一九一七年十月革命时开始的事业进行到底，把学校由资产阶级的阶级统治工具变为摧毁这种统治和完全消灭社会阶级划分的工具。学校应当成为无产阶级专政的工具”。
    伟大的领袖毛主席指出：“教育必须为无产阶级政治服务，必须同生产劳动相结合。劳动人民要知识化，知识分子要劳动化。”“我们的教育方针，应该使受教育者在德育、智育、体育几方面都得到发展，成为有社会主义觉悟的有文化的劳动者。”
    苏修领导集团彻底背叛了马克思列宁主义，背叛了无产阶级专政，背叛了社会主义事业。这伙叛徒在篡夺党政大权以后，猖狂地利用教育这个阵地为其全面复辟资本主义服务。
    苏修推行的完全是多少年来剥削阶级“劳心者治人，劳力者治于人”的那一套。苏修头目勃列日涅夫叫嚷说，他们“是从经过高等学校培养的专家中吸收从事经济工作、党的工作、国家工作、外交工作、军事工作和从事一切社会活动的干部。”苏修的另一个头目柯西金鼓吹，高等学校是培养“专家和生产组织者”。实际上，他们就是要培养脱离无产阶级政治、脱离工农群众和生产实践，高踞于劳动人民之上，满脑袋资产阶级世界观的修正主义者，来维护和巩固修正主义的统治。
    苏修领导集团竭力推行资产阶级“专家治校”的办校方针，使资产阶级学阀、反动的“学术权威”操纵高等学校大权，垄断一切，任所欲为地以各种反动思想来毒害青年。
    苏修在教学中向学生大量灌输修正主义毒素，加强思想控制，使青年脱离无产阶级政治。他们打着共产主义的招牌，贩卖资本主义的黑货。他们疯狂地反对马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想，恶毒攻击无产阶级专政和社会主义制度，大肆宣扬“阶级斗争熄灭”论和“三和两全”的修正主义路线，鼓吹资产阶级的利己主义、和平主义和人道主义。他们通过灌输、考试等手段，强迫学生接受这些反动思想，并且威胁说，对苏修的“政策缺乏明确的理解，就不能成为好的苏联专家”。
    苏修集团还竭力推行“智育第一”的一套资本主义的货色，迫使学生整天钻到书堆里，变成“背书机器”。苏修头目声嘶力竭地叫嚷，“学生的基本社会职能是：听课，到教学实验室实习，读书，用现代科学知识丰富自己。”
    苏修《真理报》今年一月八日发表的一篇文章，透露了苏修为学生所规定的既烦琐又繁重的课程情况。文章的作者说，“我遇到过各种各样的大学生。有的有才能，有的不怎么有天分，有的勤奋，有的有点懒惰。但是，他们当中没有一个人能够在几个学期里完成教学计划规定的全部课程。哪怕是一个学期也好。”按照学校规定的课程表，“学生每周应该花一百零七个小时。而一周总共才有一百四十四个小时。换句话说，把吃饭、睡觉、走路、看电影、体育活动等等加在一起，他们每天只有六个小时可用了！”文章的作者还透露，现在高等学校的学生疲于奔命地应付种种考试，
  “这里并不是培养学生的科学信念，因为他们根本没有时间批判地思考教员的观点。”
    苏修集团口口声声叫嚷他们高等院校培养工农业技术“专家”的“巨大成就”，但是苏修报刊透露的一些材料，却戳穿了他们所吹的牛皮。
    苏修《真理报》发表的一篇题为《关于把大学生培养成工程师的问题》的文章说，最近七年中，列宁格勒大专院校培养出的“工程师”，在工厂企业中不能胜任实际工作。文章透露，“在这些原因中，高等院校本身的错误占有不少的地位。”“不少专业教研组的教师的工业知识不完善以及只有片面的专业知识……大部分教师都没有参加过实际生产，他们都是从小学—大学—研究生这条老路当上教师的。”
      “高等技术学校的毕业生目前在工业规程、经济以及对生产的组织和管理方面的知识不够”，“技术经济分析能力很差……不会论证所采用的工程方案”，生产常识“少得不能容忍”。
    苏修《真理报》今年一月十六日刊登的题为《不起作用的专家》的文章透露，农业专科学校和农业学院毕业的“农艺师和畜牧师”等“不合格”，许多人并且不愿到农村去，“有大量的专家在那些同农业毫无关系的单位和生产部门中工作”，“许多年轻的农业师留在城市中”。
        鼓吹名利思想
    苏修集团千方百计用资产阶级的名利、地位和享乐思想来腐蚀青年一代，把青年“教育”成地地道道的修正主义者，来继承他们的衣钵。
    苏修大肆宣扬“求知识就是为了赢利，受教育就是为了赚钱”。他们采取了许多措施，大搞“物质刺激”，鼓励学生追名逐利。
    在苏联，学生的助学金、奖学金是根据分数发的，分数多的得钱多，分数低的得钱少以至扣发助学金。获得了大学毕业文凭就可以当“干部”、“专家”、
  “工程师”、“管理者”等等，从而收入也就比一般劳动者要多。大学毕业后，有的可以继续当研究生。研究生毕业，取得了副博士学位，名利随即增高。单凭一个副博士头衔，每月就可以多得一百七十卢布，再加上其他职务上所带来的附加收入，就更多了。以后还可以逐级沿着金字塔往上爬：副博士—博士—通讯院士—院士。而当上了院士，那就成了不得了的“大权威”和阔绰的富翁了。
    苏修叛徒们还在“发展个性”和“培养兴趣”的旗号下，在青年中大力推销腐朽的资产阶级文化和西方的生活方式，提倡寻欢作乐，追求个人享受。什么奇装异服、怪发型、爵士音乐、扭摆舞、咖啡馆、夜总会、黄色电影、裸体画、反动小说等等，都是苏修鼓吹的“现代化”青年应当感兴趣的玩艺。
    苏修的倒行逆施，使十月革命滋养起来的社会主义文化和共产主义的道德风尚，遭到严重摧残；资产阶级意识形态的乌烟瘴气，严重地毒害着青年一代。
    据苏修《列宁旗帜报》不久前透露，在莫斯科商业学院，特权阶层的子女靠着父母的权势和金钱，酗酒作乐，逛咖啡馆，横行霸道，甚至杀人行凶。“流氓、酒鬼和游手好闲的人”，“牢牢地筑起了安乐窝”，胡作非为。学生宿舍变成了贩卖进口货、投机赚钱的“闹市”。歪风邪气日益泛滥，整个商业学院“被恐惧的情绪所笼罩”。
    在修正主义的毒害下，不少青年对劳动人民的处境、国家的前途和世界革命漠不关心，只顾追求个人的名利和享乐。苏修《共青团真理报》在一篇关于大学生讨论“幸福”问题的报道中宣扬说：有的青年的生活目的就是成为一个“专家，本行的能手，然后娶个老婆，生儿育女”；有的希望得到“无数的钱”，“给自己添置一切必要的东西”；有的只喜欢“清晨去海湾”，晚上去“咖啡馆”和电影院；有的爱“留蓬头松长发”；有的人想“醉生梦死”；还有的想“生在十七世纪至十八世纪”当“海盗”。从这家报纸所赞扬的一些青年的幸福观和生活目的，人们可以清楚地看到，苏修叛徒已经把许多苏联青年带到多么危险的境地。
        排挤工农子弟
    在苏联今天的教育中，明显地存在着贫富悬殊，一方面是资产阶级特权阶层的子弟享受着种种优越条件，为所欲为，飞黄腾达；另方面是工农劳动人民的子弟和劳动青年，遭受排挤和打击。
    苏修集团宣扬什么，高等学校录取新生和淘汰大学生的唯一标准是知识、才能、考试、分数，知识是
  “最高仲裁者”等等。事实上，特权阶层的子女由于享有优越的物质条件，当然比较容易弄到考试分数进入高等学校。而且，就是他们的学习成绩很差，也仍然可以靠着权势和卢布混进大学，取得毕业文凭，得到如意的职务。
    而劳动人民的子弟和劳动青年却完全是另外一种处境。苏修《哲学问题》杂志刊登的一篇文章承认，在苏联，“由于家庭物质条件、双亲受教育程度、居住地点的不同”，青年人“受教育的可能性是不同的”。据文章作者统计，在新西伯利亚州，苏修党政干部及高薪自由职业者的子弟，有百分之八十二在中学毕业后可以升入高等学校；而“农业工作者”的子弟，很少有人能继续学习。文章透露，“导致进入高等学校的工农子弟的百分比下降”的趋势在进一步发展。
    即使有些劳动人民子弟进入了高等学校，也随时都可能被淘汰。学校的助学金是根据“分数”、而不是根据学生家庭经济情况发给的。特权阶层的子女由于有钱有势，可以通过各种贿赂、舞弊方法得到高分数。而不少劳动人民的子女要在课余兼职以维持生活，不可能集中精力应付考试，往往被取消助学金。不少的人就是这样因为“分数”不好，中途被赶出学校。
    莫斯科大学有个出身贫苦的学生，家庭有负担，他每天下课后还得出去做“零活”，干到晚上九、十点钟才回家，赚取一点钱维持生活。寒假和暑假期间，他还要去干重体力劳动，赚些钱准备下一学期的费用。
    一个农庄庄员的儿子，考入了化工学院，助学金维持不了生活，他在电话局找到了看电话的差使，每周从星期六到星期日连续工作四十八小时。他有心脏病，每次下班后，就累得瘫在床上起不来。
    电工萨沙已经三十多岁了，工作了十多年，每月工资不过八十多个卢布。他考入高等学校后，本人的助学金加上妻子的工资和老母亲的养老金，不够一家四口人的生活开支，萨沙只得经常去医院卖血。
    据苏修《苏维埃俄罗斯报》刊载的一篇文章说，苏联各高等学校“近年来被淘汰的人增多了”，乌拉尔大学“最近五年淘汰的人数几乎增加了两倍”，其中“有工龄的人占多数”。“力学数学系被淘汰的学生占入学人数的四分之一”，许多人是由于“物质原因”、“家庭条件”等等被淘汰的。
    苏修报刊还公然为高等院校排斥工农青年和工农子女的罪恶行径叫好，以资产阶级老爷的腔调叫嚷说，让“守门人、文书、售货员等等”进入大学是“奇谈怪论”。它们还诽谤劳动青年是“既没有能力，又不愿献身于科学的人”。
    苏修叛徒集团的罪恶行径，激起了苏联人民的强烈愤慨。这伙罪大恶极的叛徒，决逃脱不了应得的惩罚。
