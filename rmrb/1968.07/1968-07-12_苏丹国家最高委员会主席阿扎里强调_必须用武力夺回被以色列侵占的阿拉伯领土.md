Chairman of the Sudanese Supreme Council Ismail al-Azhari strongly condemned the aggressive tool of American imperialism, Israel, for implementing fascist policies in the occupied Arab regions. He emphasized that "what is taken by force can only be reclaimed by force."

Al-Azhari made these remarks during a farewell banquet held on the third of July in the Somali capital, Mogadishu, after completing a four-day state visit to Somalia. He pointed out that the imperialist countries have created Israel in the heart of the Arab nations, using it as a fortress to launch attacks on the liberation movements in our region. He said, "Messages from the occupied Arab regions confirm that Israel is implementing fascist policies, expelling Arab people from their homes and violating all human rights."

He stressed that the Arab people are today prepared to shed their last drop of blood to restore their rights that have been forcibly taken away.

In discussing Sudan's foreign policy towards Africa, he said, "We in Africa not only want to establish economic and cultural ties, but also support the liberation struggles of the African people still under colonial slavery." He expressed support for the liberation movements of the people of Angola, Mozambique, South Africa, Southwest Africa, and "Portuguese" Guinea, and for the struggle of the people of Zimbabwe against the reactionary regime of Smith.

In his speech, he also strongly condemned the U.S. aggression in Vietnam.

Chairman Azhari departed Mogadishu by special plane in the afternoon of the fourth.

    苏丹国家最高委员会主席阿扎里强调
    必须用武力夺回被以色列侵占的阿拉伯领土
    新华社摩加迪沙电 苏丹国家最高委员会主席伊斯梅尔·阿扎里三日晚在索马里首都摩加迪沙强烈谴责美帝国主义的侵略工具以色列在被占领的阿拉伯地区执行法西斯政策，并强调指出：“用武力夺去的东西只有用武力才能夺回”。
    阿扎里在索马里进行了为期四天的国事访问后在告别宴会上指出，帝国主义国家在阿拉伯国家心脏制造了以色列，利用它作为再次对我们地区的解放运动发动进攻的堡垒。他说：“来自被占领的阿拉伯地区的消息证实，以色列执行法西斯政策，把阿拉伯人民逐出家园，侵犯一切人权。”
    他强调说，阿拉伯人民今天准备流尽最后一滴血以恢复被强夺的权利。
    在谈到苏丹对非洲的外交政策时，他说，我们在非洲不仅要建立经济和文化的联系，而且还要支持仍处于殖民主义奴役下的非洲人民的解放斗争。他表示支持安哥拉、莫三鼻给、南非、西南非洲和“葡属”几内亚的非洲人民的解放运动，支持津巴布韦人民反对史密斯反动政权的斗争。
    他在讲话中还强烈谴责美国侵略越南。
    阿扎里主席已于四日下午乘专机离开摩加迪沙。
