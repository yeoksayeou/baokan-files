Syrian public opinion has exposed that the conspiracy of Israeli Zionists to launch a new aggression against Arab countries was hatched in the Pentagon. The Syrian newspaper *Al-Thawra* published an editorial on June 29 stating that the Arab people clearly know that the conspiracy of Israeli Zionists to launch a new aggression against Arab countries was hatched in the Pentagon. The editorial said, "The coordination and cooperation between American imperialism and Israeli Zionism in policy are so obvious that no statement or deception can cover them up." The editorial further stated that even Israeli Prime Minister Eshkol admitted, "The United States supports Israel."

The Damascus Radio broadcasted a commentary on June 26 condemning the recent maneuvers of the U.S. Sixth Fleet in the Mediterranean. The commentary said that this was an attempt to intimidate the people of various countries and protect American interests and policies in the region.

The commentary said that the Arab people cannot forget the role played by the Sixth Fleet in supporting Zionist aggression. In particular, this fleet actually participated in Israel's aggression against Arab countries last June and provided full support to the Israeli aggressor forces.

The commentary pointed out that the Arab people are not afraid of the U.S. Sixth Fleet or any other fleet. They will defeat the conspiracies of American imperialism.

    叙舆论揭露以色列侵略是五角大楼策划的
    阿拉伯人民将粉碎美帝阴谋
    据新华社大马士革二十九日电　叙利亚《革命报》二十九日发表社论说，阿拉伯人民清楚地知道，以色列犹太复国主义者对阿拉伯国家发动新侵略的阴谋是在美国国防部大厅里策划的。社论说：“美帝国主义和以色列犹太复国主义在政策方面的协调和配合是如此明显，这是任何声明和欺骗都掩盖不了的。”社论接着说，甚至以色列总理艾希科尔也供认：“美国支持以色列。”
    大马士革电台二十六日广播一篇评论，谴责美国第六舰队最近在地中海进行演习活动。评论说，这是企图吓唬各国人民，保护美国在这个地区的利益和政策。
    评论说，阿拉伯人民不能忘记第六舰队在支持犹太复国主义侵略方面所起的作用。特别是这支舰队实际参加了以色列去年六月对阿拉伯国家的侵略活动，向以色列侵略部队提供充分的支援。
    评论指出，阿拉伯人民不害怕美国第六舰队或别的什么舰队，他们将击败美帝国主义的阴谋。
