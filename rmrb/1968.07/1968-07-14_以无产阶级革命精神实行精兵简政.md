The editorial note attached to the report titled "The Revolutionary Committee of Lingbao County Implements the Revolutionary Transformation of the Leadership Team, Precision and Streamlining, and Close Ties with the Masses" by the People's Daily reached us. The standing committee members of our factory's revolutionary committee, with the help of the PLA's leftist support team stationed at the factory, immediately conducted a serious study and discussion. Everyone unanimously agreed that the editorial note conveys a new battle order from the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin. We must resolutely carry it out.

All standing committee members also took the experience of Lingbao County as a mirror to identify the gaps in our work and resolved to further improve the two tasks of cleaning up the class ranks and precision and streamlining, to consolidate and develop the great achievements of the Cultural Revolution organizationally.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Revolutionary committees should implement unified leadership, break down redundant administrative structures, practice precision and streamlining, and organize a revolutionary leadership team that is connected with the masses." This is the guiding light for the revolutionary construction of revolutionary committees. In March of this year, our factory took the first step to streamline the organizational structure, reducing it from the original twenty-five departments to one office (Revolutionary Committee Office), three groups (Political Work Group, Production Group, Living Group), and four workshops. The number of on-duty cadres was reduced by seventy-two percent, breaking down redundant administrative structures and implementing unified leadership.

In the process of streamlining the structure, we deeply felt that implementing precision and streamlining is a sharp and profound class struggle. A handful of traitors, spies, unrepentant capitalist-roaders, and untransformed landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists blew cold winds and set off ghost fires, using every possible means to sabotage. Some members of the revolutionary committee also had rightist conservative thoughts, daring not to break out of the old organizational framework, not daring to reduce this department or that office, always seeking stability and fearing chaos. Some cadres, influenced by old habits, did not clearly understand the great significance of "precision and streamlining," holding some confused notions, saying things like "it won't look good to go down, and it won't be easy to stay."

The revolutionary committee carefully analyzed these situations and believed that the sabotage by class enemies must be firmly suppressed; the ideological issues of revolutionary comrades must be resolved through education. With the help of the PLA's leftist support team stationed at the factory, the revolutionary committee led the broad revolutionary masses to expose and strike down the class enemies who were carrying out sabotage in conjunction with the cleanup of class ranks. At the same time, a thorough revolutionary criticism was launched, fiercely criticizing the revisionist line that Chinese Khrushchev promoted in the construction of power, exposing the dangers of a cumbersome structure, and investigating the roots of the cumbersome structure. Everyone realized that the cumbersome old structure is a breeding ground for bureaucracy and revisionism, causing cadres to become detached from the masses and potentially degenerate. After recognizing the significance of "precision and streamlining," the broad revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres actively advocated for the reform of the old structure, successively proposing more than forty reform plans.

After the list of cadres to be sent to the front line was announced, most cadres had correct understandings, but some cadres developed some wrong thoughts. Some thought: "The cadres going down are all those who have made mistakes"; someone thought: "Technical cadres going to the production front line is a waste of talent," and so on. We analyzed these thoughts and found that they were all due to the "self" of the bourgeoisie. How to solve this? Chairman Mao teaches us: "Running study classes is a good method, and many problems can be solved in study classes." We organized a study class of Mao Zedong Thought, mainly for cadres going to the front line, with the participation of PLA leftist support team members and old workers. In the study class, with Chairman Mao's latest instructions as the guideline and the "Three Articles" as the weapon, we carried out self-criticism and criticism of revisionism, raising the awareness of these comrades. Worker comrades expressed their welcome to revolutionary cadres going to the production front line and had individual talks with the cadres, welcoming them with drums and gongs. As a result, the masses, the cadres being sent down, and the revolutionary committee were all satisfied.

After the new leadership team was established, it inherited and carried forward the Party's fine tradition of close ties with the masses, often going deep into the masses, learning Chairman Mao's works together with the broad revolutionary masses, and promoting revolution and production together. The broad revolutionary masses praised: "The new leadership team is good, they are one with us, as much oil and dirt on our bodies as on theirs, as much sweat as we have." This further mobilized the enthusiasm of the broad revolutionary masses, making the revolution vigorous and greatly improving the production level. The workers also launched technological innovation activities, and some major innovation projects reached and exceeded the world's advanced level.

We have done some work in the previous period and achieved some results, but there is still a long way to go from Chairman Mao's teachings and a significant gap from Lingbao County. We must take Chairman Mao's latest instructions as the guideline, take Lingbao County as an example, further implement precision and streamlining on the current basis, go to the front line, and take root among the masses, building our factory's revolutionary committee into a revolutionary and mass-connected command center.

    以无产阶级革命精神实行精兵简政
    石家庄印染厂革命委员会
    《人民日报》为《灵宝县革委会实行领导班子革命化，精兵简政，密切联系群众》的报道所加的重要编者按一传来，我厂革委会的常委们在驻厂解放军支左同志的帮助下，立即进行了认真的学习讨论。大家一致认为，编者按传达了以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的新的战斗号令。我们一定坚决照办。
    全体常委还以灵宝县的经验为镜子，找出了我们工作中的差距，决心进一步做好清理阶级队伍和精兵简政这两件工作，从组织上巩固和发展无产阶级文化大革命的伟大成果。
    毛主席教导我们：“革命委员会要实行一元化的领导，打破重叠的行政机构，精兵简政，组织起一个革命化的联系群众的领导班子。”这是革命委员会革命化建设的指路明灯。今年三月份，我厂就对组织机构实行了第一步精简，由原来二十五个部门精简合并成为一室（革委会办公室）、三组（政工组、生产组、生活组）、四个车间。在职干部减少了百分之七十二，打破了重叠的行政机构，实行了一元化领导。
    在精简机构的过程中，我们深深体会到，实行精兵简政，是一场尖锐的、深刻的阶级斗争。一小撮叛徒、特务、死不改悔的走资派，没有改造好的地、富、反、坏、右分子，煽阴风，点鬼火，千方百计地进行破坏。有的革委会成员，也存在着右倾保守思想，不敢跳出旧机构的圈子，这个部门不敢减，那个科室不敢动，老是求稳怕乱。有的干部受旧习惯势力的影响，对“精兵简政”的重大意义认识不清，存在一些糊涂观念，说什么“下去不好看，留下不好干”。
    革委会认真分析了这些情况，认为对于阶级敌人的破坏，必须坚决打击；对于革命同志的认识问题，要通过教育加以解决。革委会在驻厂解放军支左同志的帮助下，带领广大革命群众，结合清理阶级队伍，揭露和打击了进行破坏的阶级敌人。同时，深入开展革命的大批判，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫在政权建设方面所推行的反革命修正主义路线，大揭机构庞杂的危害，大查造成机构庞杂的根源。大家认识到，庞杂的旧机构，是产生官僚主义和修正主义的温床，它使干部同广大群众脱离，并可使干部蜕化变质。对于“精兵简政”的意义认识提高以后，广大革命群众和革命干部积极要求改革旧机构，先后提出了四十多个改革方案。
    充实第一线的干部名单公布以后，多数干部认识正确，有的干部又产生了一些错误思想。有的认为：“下去的干部都是犯了错误的”；有人认为：“技术干部充实生产第一线，是大材小用”，等等。我们分析这些思想，都是资产阶级的“私”字在作怪。怎样解决呢？毛主席教导我们：“办学习班，是个好办法，很多问题可以在学习班得到解决。”我们举办了以充实第一线的干部为主，有解放军支左同志、老工人参加的毛泽东思想学习班。在学习班里，以毛主席最新指示为纲，以“老三篇”为武器，开展了斗私批修，使这些同志提高了认识。工人同志表示，欢迎革命干部充实生产第一线，并找干部个别谈心，敲锣打鼓地欢迎他们。结果，作到了群众、下放的革命干部和革委会三满意。
    新班子建立以后，继承和发扬了党的紧密联系群众的优良作风，经常深入群众，和广大革命群众一起学习毛主席著作，一起抓革命，促生产。广大革命群众赞扬说：“新班子就是好，和我们打成一片，我们身上有多少油泥，他们身上也有多少油泥，我们出多少汗，他们也出多少汗。这同过去大不一样了！”这就进一步调动了广大革命群众的积极性，革命搞得轰轰烈烈，生产水平大幅度提高。职工们还开展了技术革新活动，有些重大革新项目达到和超过了世界先进水平。
    我们在前段时间做了一些工作，取得了一些成绩，但是距离毛主席的教导还差得很远，跟灵宝县还有不小差距。我们一定要以毛主席的最新指示为指针，以灵宝县为榜样，在现有基础上进一步实行精兵简政，走上第一线，扎根于群众之中，把我厂革委会建设成为革命化的联系群众的战斗指挥部。
