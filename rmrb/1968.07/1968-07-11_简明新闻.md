Indonesian Reactionaries and Dutch Colonialists Intensify Collaboration

The fascist military regime in Indonesia, which had been ruled by the Dutch for over three hundred years, signed an "economic cooperation agreement" and a "cultural agreement" with the Dutch colonialists in Jakarta on July 7th, further paving the way for the return of Dutch colonialist forces to Indonesia.

The Jakarta radio station openly admitted that the "economic cooperation agreement" "laid the foundation for Dutch investment in Indonesia." According to this "agreement," the Dutch will invest in various sectors in Indonesia, including industry, agriculture, commerce, and transportation. The "cultural agreement" stipulates that both sides will "strengthen cooperation" in science, culture, and the arts, allowing the Dutch to resume cultural infiltration in Indonesia.
