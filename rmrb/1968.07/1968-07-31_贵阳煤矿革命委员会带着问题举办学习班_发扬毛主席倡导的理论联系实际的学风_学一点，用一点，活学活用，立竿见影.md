The Revolutionary Committee of Guiyang Coal Mine, following the great leader Chairman Mao's instruction that "holding study sessions is a good method, and many problems can be solved in study sessions," has long insisted on holding and improving Mao Zedong Thought study sessions. This has promoted the ideological transformation of people and driven various works forward, making it a red flag in the industrial and transportation system of Guizhou Province for seizing the revolution and promoting production.

The main experience of Guiyang Coal Mine in holding and improving Mao Zedong Thought study sessions is to follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, using the unyielding Mao Zedong Thought as the "arrow" to hit the target of the current revolutionary struggle and production struggle. Each study session focuses on solving one or two key problems, not seeking too many, but seeking real results, fighting decisive battles, and solving problems without leaving any loose ends.

Since last June, the mine has held 71 study sessions. Over 2,000 revolutionary workers in the entire mine have participated in the study sessions, with half of them attending two sessions. The families of revolutionary workers have also undergone training in the study sessions. Once the great Mao Zedong Thought is grasped by the broad revolutionary masses, it becomes a tremendous material force for transforming nature and society. Liu Wengui, the chairman of the revolutionary committee and a young coal miner, deeply feels that "holding Mao Zedong Thought study sessions has guided us, under the unyielding Mao Zedong Thought, to overcome one difficulty after another, navigate one danger after another, and achieve one victory after another."

The class struggle in Guiyang Coal Mine is extremely sharp and complex. A small clique of diehard capitalists within the party fiercely opposed Mao Zedong Thought and vigorously promoted the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of the Chinese Khrushchev. In the early days of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, they played double-faced tricks, deceiving many people into joining conservative organizations, inciting people to fight each other, and disrupting the revolution and production. Therefore, how to unite and educate the deceived masses to return to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line became a prominent issue for the mine to handle various works well. In June last year, the stationed army, following Chairman Mao's instruction that "grasping ideological education is the central link in uniting the whole party to wage a great political struggle," decided to hold study sessions to focus on solving the problem of uniting and educating the deceived masses. In the study sessions, the revolutionary masses of the proletariat and the deceived masses repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's brilliant work "Analysis of the Classes in Chinese Society" and his statements on class struggle, enabling the participants to learn to use the method of class analysis to analyze the situation of the struggle between the two lines. Through the study, the revolutionary masses of the proletariat realized that the deceived masses are their class brothers and should be united, educated, and helped, directing their hatred towards the small clique of capitalist-roaders within the party led by the Chinese Khrushchev. Some deceived masses also realized that the overall direction was wrong, and everything was wrong, thus raising their class struggle consciousness and awareness of the struggle between the two lines, and resolving to return to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line to fight together with the revolutionary masses of the proletariat. By September last year, the revolutionary masses of the proletariat had united more than 90% of the revolutionary workers in the entire mine. Since then, the revolutionary masses of the proletariat and the revolutionary masses in Guiyang Coal Mine have tasted the sweetness of holding study sessions, and they have put holding and improving study sessions at the top of all their work. The main leaders of the revolutionary committee personally oversee the study sessions, holding them where the struggle is most complex and solving specific problems with study sessions.

The full implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions is the full victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The Revolutionary Committee of Guiyang Coal Mine regards holding and improving Mao Zedong Thought study sessions as the most effective way to carry out Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions and insists on it. As soon as Chairman Mao's latest instructions are issued, the revolutionary committee immediately holds study sessions to study, discuss, and implement them. After Chairman Mao's latest instructions on revolutionary committees were issued, the revolutionary committee immediately held study sessions to quickly implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions in actual work, drastically streamlining organizations and reducing the number of full-time personnel. To "organize a revolutionary and people-oriented leadership team," the members of the revolutionary committee average 20 days of productive labor per month. The six members of the revolutionary production leadership team of No. 3 Shaft, except for meeting times, all work in shifts. Only one dispatcher remains fully detached.

After Chairman Mao issued a series of latest instructions such as "fight selfishness and criticize revisionism," achieve revolutionary great alliance and revolutionary three-in-one combination, the Revolutionary Committee of Guiyang Coal Mine held special study sessions and quickly implemented them. Recently, the revolutionary committee, following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, held study sessions focusing on the struggle against the enemy, mobilizing the masses, relying on the masses, guiding the masses, and launching a fierce attack on a small clique of class enemies, uncovering a group of deeply hidden traitors, spies, and counter-revolutionaries, greatly boosting the morale of the proletariat and thoroughly crushing the arrogance of the class enemies.

The Revolutionary Committee of Guiyang Coal Mine calls this method of focusing on solving one or two key problems in each study session "holding study sessions with problems in mind." They say that this way, the focus is clear, the purpose is definite, and it is easy to achieve immediate results.

The Revolutionary Committee of Guiyang Coal Mine places great emphasis on promoting Chairman Mao's advocated revolutionary learning style of combining theory with practice, learning a little, using a little, and applying it actively in study sessions. In the latter half of last year, the class enemies blew the counter-revolutionary wind of economism again, disrupting production and revolution. The revolutionary committee, in two consecutive study sessions focusing on opposing the counter-revolutionary wind of economism, led the revolutionary masses to thoroughly study the "Three Articles," everyone with the spirit of "completely" and "thoroughly" serving the people, "selflessly serving others," strictly demanded of themselves. As a result, the counter-revolutionary wind of economism was quickly stopped, and a small clique of class enemies who incited the counter-revolutionary wind of economism and disrupted the revolution and production were exposed.

Through holding study sessions and the mass movement of actively applying Chairman Mao's works, Mao Zedong Thought has been widely popularized throughout the mine, and the spiritual face of revolutionary workers has undergone tremendous and profound changes. Not long ago, a few workers were developing a new coal mining face. They had just drilled about six or seven meters when they suddenly heard the top plate cracking loudly, a sign that the top plate was about to collapse. At this critical moment, if they wanted to run, they could escape the cave in two steps. However, these workers, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, did not consider their own safety. They first thought of the state's property. The deputy squad leader ordered a worker to carry the electric drill out of the cave, while he and the other two comrades shouted, "With firm resolve, fearing no sacrifice, overcoming all difficulties, and striving for victory," quickly dismantling the electric conveyor. With a loud crash, the top plate collapsed, sealing the cave entrance and burying the three loyal workers under two meters of debris. At this time, the slogan "Long live Chairman Mao" could be heard from the stone cracks. The comrades outside quickly dug another entrance to rescue them. As soon as the entrance was opened, the three comrades inside carried the electric conveyor and dragged the shovels and steel picks out.

Now, the mine's revolutionary workers have more and more vivid deeds of being loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. The revolutionary and production situation is getting better and better. The coal production in the first half of this year has exceeded the total production of last year, and the average monthly production has exceeded the highest level in history.

    贵阳煤矿革命委员会带着问题举办学习班
    发扬毛主席倡导的理论联系实际的学风
    学一点，用一点，活学活用，立竿见影
    据新华社贵阳三十日电　贵阳煤矿革命委员会遵照伟大领袖毛主席“办学习班，是个好办法，很多问题可以在学习班得到解决”的教导，长期坚持大办、办好毛泽东思想学习班，促进了人的思想革命化，推动了各项工作，成为贵州省工交系统抓革命、促生产的一面红旗。
    贵阳煤矿大办、办好毛泽东思想学习班的主要经验是，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，用战无不胜的毛泽东思想之“矢”，射当前革命斗争和生产斗争实际之“的”。每一期学习班，集中解决一两个关键问题，不贪多，求实效，打歼灭战，解决问题不留尾巴。
    这个矿从去年六月开始举办学习班到现在，共办了七十一期，全矿两千多名革命职工普遍参加过学习班的学习，其中有半数人参加过两期。革命职工家属也先后在学习班轮训了一遍。伟大的毛泽东思想一旦被广大革命群众所掌握，就变成了改造自然、改造社会的巨大物质力量。矿革委会主任、青年采煤工人刘文贵深有体会地说：“大办毛泽东思想学习班，使我们在战无不胜的毛泽东思想的指引下，度过了一个又一个险滩，绕过了一个又一个暗礁，取得了一个又一个胜利。”
    贵阳煤矿的阶级斗争非常尖锐、复杂。矿里党内一小撮顽固不化的走资派，疯狂地反对毛泽东思想，竭力推行中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义路线。无产阶级文化大革命初期，他们又大耍反革命两面派手法，蒙蔽不少群众参加保守组织，挑动群众斗群众，破坏革命，破坏生产。因此，如何团结教育受蒙蔽的群众回到毛主席的革命路线上来，成了这个矿搞好各项工作的一个突出问题。去年六月间，驻厂解放军遵照毛主席“掌握思想教育，是团结全党进行伟大政治斗争的中心环节”的教导，决定开办学习班，集中解决团结教育受蒙蔽群众的问题。无产阶级革命派和受蒙蔽的群众在学习班里，反复学习毛主席的《中国社会各阶级的分析》这一光辉著作和关于阶级斗争的论述，使学员们学会用阶级分析的方法，分析两条路线斗争的形势。通过学习，无产阶级革命派认识到，受蒙蔽的群众是自己的阶级兄弟，要团结、教育和帮助他们，把仇恨集中到中国赫鲁晓夫等党内一小撮走资派身上。一些受蒙蔽的群众也认识到，大方向错了，一切都错了，从而提高了阶级斗争观念和两条路线斗争觉悟，决心回到毛主席革命路线上来，和无产阶级革命派共同战斗。到去年九月间，无产阶级革命派就团结了全矿百分之九十以上的革命职工。从此，贵阳煤矿无产阶级革命派和革命群众尝到了办学习班的甜头，他们把大办、办好学习班放在一切工作的首位。矿革委会主要负责人亲自抓学习班，那里斗争最复杂，就在那里办学习班；那个问题最难解决，就办学习班专门解决那个问题。
    毛主席最新指示的全面落实，就是无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。贵阳煤矿革委会把大办、办好毛泽东思想学习班，看作是贯彻执行毛主席一系列最新指示的最有效的办法，一抓到底。毛主席最新指示一公布，革委会就立即办学习班，学习讨论，贯彻执行。毛主席关于革命委员会的最新指示发表后，矿革委会立即办学习班，使毛主席的最新指示很快落实到实际工作中去，大刀阔斧地精简机构，减少脱产人员。为了“组织起一个革命化的联系群众的领导班子”，矿革委会成员平均每月参加二十天生产劳动。三号井革命生产领导小组的六个同志，除了开会时间外，都跟班劳动，真正脱产的只剩下一个调度员。
    毛主席在发出“要斗私，批修”、实现革命大联合和革命三结合等一系列最新指示后，贵阳煤矿革委会都曾专门开办过学习班，迅速落实。最近，矿革委会又紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，举办以对敌斗争为内容的学习班，发动群众，依靠群众，引导群众，向一小撮阶级敌人发动了猛烈进攻，挖出了一批隐藏很深的叛徒、特务、反革命分子，大长了无产阶级的志气，大灭了阶级敌人的威风。
    贵阳煤矿革委会把这种每期学习班只集中解决一两个关键问题的方法，叫做带着问题办学习班。他们说，这样办，中心突出，目的明确，容易收到立竿见影的效果。
    贵阳煤矿革委会办学习班，十分强调发扬毛主席倡导的理论联系实际的革命学风，学一点，用一点，活学活用，学用结合。去年下半年，阶级敌人再次刮起反革命经济主义的妖风，破坏生产，破坏革命。矿革委会在接连两期以反对反革命经济主义妖风为内容的学习班中，领导革命群众大学“老三篇”，大家以“完全”“彻底”为人民服务，“毫不利己专门利人”的精神，严格要求自己。结果很快刹住了反革命经济主义妖风，揪出了煽动反革命经济主义妖风，破坏抓革命、促生产的一小撮阶级敌人。
    通过大办学习班和活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动，毛泽东思想在全矿空前大普及，革命职工的精神面貌起了巨大深刻的变化。不久前，有几个工人开拓新的采煤工作面，刚刚打进六七米，忽然听到顶板辟辟啪啪直响，这是顶板要塌陷的信号。在这紧要关头，如果想跑，两步就能跑出洞口。但是这几位用毛泽东思想武装起来的工人，没有考虑自身的安危，他们首先想到的是国家财产。副排长命令一个工人扛起电钻跑出去，自己却和另外两个同志高喊着“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”，迅速地拆卸电溜子。轰隆一声，顶板垮了下来，封住了洞口，把无限忠于毛主席的三个好工人埋在二米见方的洞里。这时，里面不断从石缝中传出“毛主席万岁”的口号声。外边的同志急忙另打洞口抢救。洞口刚刚打通，里面的三个同志就抬着电溜子，拖着铁锹、钢钎出来了。
    现在，全矿革命职工无限忠于毛主席、无限忠于毛泽东思想、无限忠于毛主席革命路线的生动事迹越来越多，革命和生产形势越来越好。今年头六个月的煤产量，超过去年全年的总产量，平均月产量超过历史上的最高水平。
