The song "The East Is Red, the sun rises, China has given birth to Mao Zedong, he seeks happiness for the people, he is the great savior of the people..." echoes far and wide.

In the many places across the five continents where the revolutionary struggle is flourishing, countless revolutionaries apply the invincible Mao Zedong Thought to the revolutionary struggle in their own countries. In the days of battle, countless revolutionaries face the red sun and sing "The East Is Red" with abandon, praising the greatest contemporary Marxist-Leninist and the great teacher of the proletariat, Mao Zedong.

	Facing the Red Sun, Singing "The East Is Red"

	"The East rises with a red sun,
	The brilliant light illuminates the whole world,
	The red sun is Chairman Mao.
	Facing the red sun, we sing 'The East Is Red' with abandon,
	Let this song spread across the five continents and four seas,
	Let this song resonate through the universe."

	This passionate poem was written by a friend from an Arab country. Like this friend, many foreign friends have expressed their love and admiration for Chairman Mao in various ways and on various occasions.

	It was when a Chinese distant-sea cargo ship was docked at a port in Indonesia. Several Indonesian dock workers came aboard the ship. As soon as they entered the hall, they stood in front of the high-hanging portrait of Chairman Mao, gazing at the glorious image of our great leader Mao. After a while, these workers, filled with deep emotion, requested that the Chinese crew members teach them to sing "The East Is Red." They said, "The Indonesian people need the light of the sun the most, and this sun is Chairman Mao. This sunlight is Mao Zedong Thought. With Mao Zedong Thought, the revolution of the Indonesian people has hope. Chairman Mao is the great savior of the oppressed people of the world. We love Chairman Mao, and we love to sing 'The East Is Red.'"

	Let the Song of "The East Is Red" Resound Around the World

	Once, an international train was roaring along when suddenly, the sound of the solemn "The East Is Red" whistle filled the car.

	Following the sound, a French young woman was seen holding a transverse flute, playing "The East Is Red." The emotionally charged flute music attracted passengers from various countries, and as the music stopped, the car erupted in enthusiastic applause. It turned out that during her visit to China, this young woman had the fortune to see our great leader Chairman Mao. To commemorate this unforgettable joyous event, she specially bought a Chinese flute to play songs praising Chairman Mao. She said, "Chairman Mao is a great leader, and 'The East Is Red' is the best song. I want to let the song of 'The East Is Red' resound around the world."

	A Pakistani friend brought three children to China. As soon as the children saw the Chinese staff, they asked for Chairman Mao's badges. After receiving the radiant Chairman Mao badges, the three children sang "The East Is Red" in loud voices. As the song ended, the children's mother said to the Chinese staff, "Our whole family loves Chairman Mao and loves to sing 'The East Is Red.'"

	A Norwegian friend who had just arrived in China asked the Chinese staff to teach him "The East Is Red" as soon as he got on the train. He learned very seriously, singing it over and over again. It turned out that this Norwegian friend was entrusted by his friend to definitely learn "The East Is Red" in Chinese after coming to China. This Norwegian friend finally learned it. He happily shook hands with the Chinese staff and said, "The people of my country love Chairman Mao, and I must let more people know how to sing 'The East Is Red.'"

	Shouting in Unison, "Long Live Chairman Mao Forever!"

	One day, five sailors from Malaysia and other countries who came to Dalian Port had a friendly and cordial discussion with the Red Guards. As soon as the discussion began, the sailors sang "The East Is Red" and "Wishing Chairman Mao a Long Life" together with the Red Guards. One sailor, holding a red "Quotations from Chairman Mao," said, "Although I am very poor, I have no pounds, and I have no dollars, but I have this book, which is a priceless treasure."

	Not long ago, sailors from various countries and Chinese sailors held a get-together at the sailors' club in Dalian Port. At the get-together filled with friendly atmosphere, sailors from various countries, holding the red revolutionary treasure "Quotations from Chairman Mao," took turns performing. They sang "Beijing Has a Golden Sun" and "Sailing the Seas Depends on the Helmsman."

	Finally, all the sailors sang "The East Is Red" together, praising the great leader Chairman Mao. Then, a sailor from Africa led everyone in shouting, "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand times ten thousand years!" "Wishing Chairman Mao a Long Life! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand times ten thousand years!"

    我们爱唱《东方红》
    ——记外国友人热爱毛主席的生动事例
    “东方红，太阳升，中国出了个毛泽东，他为人民谋幸福，他是人民大救星……”的歌声，响彻四方。
    在革命斗争蓬勃发展的五大洲的许多地方，多少革命者把战无不胜的毛泽东思想运用于本国革命斗争的实践；在战斗的日子里，多少革命者迎着红太阳，纵情高唱《东方红》，歌颂当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者、无产阶级的伟大导师毛泽东。
  迎着红太阳　高唱《东方红》
      “东方升起红太阳，
    灿烂的金光把全世界照亮，
    红太阳就是毛主席。
    迎着红太阳纵情高唱《东方红》，
    让这歌声传遍五洲四海，
    让这歌声在宇宙中震荡。”
    这一首热情的诗，是阿拉伯国家的一位朋友写的。象这位朋友一样，许多外国友人也在各种场合，用不同的方式，共同表达了他们对毛主席的热爱和敬仰。
    那是我国一艘远洋货轮停泊在印度尼西亚某港口的时候。有几位印度尼西亚的码头工人来到船上，他们一走进大厅，就伫立在高高悬挂着的毛主席像前，仰望我们的伟大领袖毛主席的光辉形象。过了一会，这些工人们满怀深情地请求中国船员教他们唱《东方红》。他们说，印度尼西亚人民最需要太阳的光辉，这太阳就是毛主席，这阳光就是毛泽东思想。有了毛泽东思想，印尼人民的革命就有了希望。毛主席是世界上被压迫人民的大救星，我们热爱毛主席，我们爱唱《东方红》。
  让《东方红》的歌声响遍天下
    一次，一列国际列车，正隆隆飞驰，突然间，车厢里响起了庄严的《东方红》的笛声。
    寻声望去，只见一位法国女青年，手捧横笛，吹奏着《东方红》歌曲。充满感情的笛声吸引了各国旅客，笛声一停，车厢里立刻爆发出热烈的掌声。原来，这位女青年在中国访问期间，幸福地见到了我们伟大领袖毛主席。为了纪念这一终生难忘的大喜事，她特意买了一只中国笛子，吹奏赞颂毛主席的歌曲。她说，毛主席是伟大的领袖，《东方红》是最好的歌，我要让《东方红》的歌声响遍天下。
    一位巴基斯坦朋友带着三个孩子来到我国，三个孩子一见到中国工作人员，就要求得到毛主席像章。当他们得到光芒四射的毛主席像章以后，三个孩子用响亮的声音唱起了《东方红》。歌声刚落，孩子的母亲向中国工作人员说，我们一家都热爱毛主席，都爱唱《东方红》。
    一位刚来到我国的挪威朋友，一上火车就请求中国工作人员教他唱《东方红》。他学得很认真，唱了一遍又一遍。原来这位挪威朋友，是受他的朋友的委托，要他到中国后一定要用中国话学会《东方红》。这位挪威朋友终于学会了。他十分高兴地握着中国工作人员的手说：“我国人民热爱毛主席，我一定要让更多的人会唱《东方红》。”
  齐声高呼“祝毛主席万寿无疆！”
    一天，来到大连港的马来亚等国家的五位海员，同红卫兵小将进行了亲切友好的座谈。座谈一开始，海员们同红卫兵小将一起高唱《东方红》和《祝福毛主席万寿无疆》。一位海员手捧红彤彤的《毛主席语录》说，我虽然很穷，没有英镑，也没有美金，但是，我有了这本书，就有了无价之宝。
    不久前，来到大连港的各国海员和中国海员一起，在海员俱乐部举行联欢。在充满友好气氛的联欢会上，各国海员手捧红色革命宝书《毛主席语录》，纷纷出场表演，他们唱了《北京有个金太阳》，又唱《大海航行靠舵手》。
    最后，全体海员齐唱《东方红》，共同歌颂伟大领袖毛主席。随后，一位来自非洲的海员，带领大家一遍又一遍地高呼：“毛主席万岁！万万岁！”“祝毛主席万寿无疆！万寿无疆！”
