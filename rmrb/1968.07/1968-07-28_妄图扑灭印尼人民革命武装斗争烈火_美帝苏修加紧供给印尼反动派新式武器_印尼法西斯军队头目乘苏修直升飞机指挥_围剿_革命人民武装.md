The U.S. imperialists and Soviet revisionists are hurriedly supplying the Indonesian reactionaries with new weapons in an attempt to extinguish the blazing fire of the Indonesian people's armed revolutionary struggle. The heads of the Indonesian fascist military are using Soviet revisionist helicopters to command the "encirclement and suppression" of the revolutionary armed forces of the people.

New China News Agency, July 24th: A message from Jakarta reports that the fascist military regime in Indonesia is hurriedly arming its reactionary army with new weapons provided by the Soviet revisionists and U.S. imperialists in an attempt to extinguish the flames of the Indonesian people's armed revolutionary struggle.

According to the Antara News Agency, the reactionary military authorities in various provinces of Indonesia are currently conducting so-called "new-style infantry training." The reactionary army officers and soldiers participating in the first session of training held by the First Infantry Brigade of the Jakarta Military Region conducted a "rocket launch exercise" in the Mabuk County in early July. The message admits that these weapons used to suppress the people's armed forces are provided by the Soviet revisionists, U.S. imperialists, and Yugoslavia.

While the Suharto-Nasution fascist military regime is hurriedly training the reactionary army, it is using weapons provided by the Soviet revisionists and U.S. imperialists to brutally suppress the Indonesian people's armed revolutionary struggle. According to Western news agencies, the head of the West Kalimantan Military Region, Witonu, commanded the reactionary military forces to "encircle and suppress" the people's armed revolutionary forces in West Kalimantan in late May, using a helicopter provided by the Soviet revisionists! In early July, the Soviet revisionist traitor clique openly agreed to extend the repayment period for an $800 million military loan to this reactionary regime. On the 21st, the head of the Indonesian fascist military regime, Suharto, expressed satisfaction with the Soviet revisionist traitor clique's "friendship," saying that his regime has a "common foundation" with the Soviet revisionist traitor clique.

The Indonesian fascist military regime dreams of using weapons provided by the Soviet revisionists and U.S. imperialists to extinguish the flames of the Indonesian people's armed revolutionary struggle, but this will never succeed. The revolutionary armed struggle of the Indonesian people, like a spark igniting a prairie fire, will burn more fiercely and ultimately bury the Suharto-Nasution fascist military regime completely.

    新华社二十四日讯雅加达消息：印度尼西亚法西斯军人政权正在加紧用苏修和美帝提供的新式武器武装它的反动军队，妄图扑灭印尼人民革命武装斗争的烽火。
    据安塔拉通讯社透露，目前，印尼各省的反动军事当局都在进行所谓“新型步兵训练”。参加雅加达军区第一步兵旅举办的第一期训练的反动陆军官兵，七月初在茂物县进行了“发射火箭弹的演习”。消息供认这些用来镇压人民武装力量的杀人武器，都是苏修、美帝和南斯拉夫提供的。
    苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯军人政权在加紧训练反动军队的同时，正在使用苏修和美帝提供的武器，疯狂镇压印尼人民革命武装斗争。据西方通讯社透露，西加里曼丹军区头目维托诺五月底指挥
  “围剿”西加里曼丹人民革命武装力量的反动军队时乘坐的直升飞机，就是苏修提供的！苏修叛徒集团为了维持印尼法西斯军人政权的反动统治，七月初还公然同意这个反动政权延期偿还八亿美元的军事贷款。印尼法西斯军人政权头目苏哈托二十一日对苏修叛徒集团的这种“友谊”表示满意，说什么他的政权同苏修叛徒集团“有着共同的基础”。
    印尼法西斯军人政权梦想用苏修和美帝提供的武器来扑灭印尼人民革命武装斗争的烽火，是永远不能得逞的。印尼人民兴起的革命武装斗争，犹如星火燎原，必将越烧越旺，最后把苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯军人政权彻底埋葬。
