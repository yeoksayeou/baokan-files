The revolutionary committee implemented streamlining and reducing bureaucracy, resulting in fewer people and more work. How to handle this? The West Mountain Commune Revolutionary Committee in Ping Shan County, Hebei Province, has a significant experience: fully utilize the role of non-full-time committee members and rely on the masses to solve problems at the grassroots level.

	How to strengthen the connection with the masses?
	When the West Mountain Commune Revolutionary Committee was first established, there were eight full-time cadres. After implementing streamlining and reducing bureaucracy, only the committee chairman and two vice-chairmen remained full-time. In the situation of fewer people and more work, the three full-time cadres were initially busy with work in the commune office, and they had less contact with the masses. Instructions from higher authorities were only conveyed through meetings, and the situation from below was only reported by team cadres. Some problems were not handled properly. The masses criticized them for having "new institutions but old styles."

	Facing the masses' criticism, the three full-time committee members sat down and repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's teachings: "The most fundamental principle in reforming state organs is to connect with the masses." "The most intelligent and most talented are those with the most practical experience." They realized that the situation of sitting in the office and being detached from the masses must be changed. A good way to change this situation is to fully utilize the role of non-full-time committee members. Utilizing these comrades can solve a large number of problems at the grassroots level, which can strengthen the connection between the revolutionary committee and the broad masses and allow full-time cadres to free up time to connect with the masses. Therefore, whether to attach importance to and utilize the role of revolutionary mass representatives is not a small matter, but a major issue of whether to eliminate the poisonous influence of the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of the Chinese Khrushchev and whether to be loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

	Thus, they held a study class on Mao Zedong Thought for the members of the West Mountain Commune Revolutionary Committee in the place where Chairman Mao once lived—West Mountain Village. They reviewed Chairman Mao's relevant works and his latest instructions: "The basic experience of the revolutionary committee is to have representatives of revolutionary cadres, representatives of the army, and representatives of revolutionary masses, achieving the three-in-one combination." They also visited the West Mountain Revolutionary Historical Museum, recalling Chairman Mao's great revolutionary practice in West Mountain. When they saw the hoe and sickle that Chairman Mao used to work with the masses in West Mountain, everyone was moved and their blood boiled. The full-time cadres examined their shortcomings of not closely connecting with the masses. The non-full-time cadres also increased their enthusiasm for participating in the construction of the political power. A member of the West Mountain Commune Revolutionary Committee and the militia company commander of Jia Yu Village, Liu Pingyi, said: "In the past, I always thought that you are cadres and we are commune members. What committee members or not, you say how to do it, and we do it. In the future, I will definitely follow Chairman Mao's words, care about state affairs, stand in Jia Yu, think about the entire commune, see the entire country, and together with everyone, manage the revolution and production of West Mountain Commune well, and add glory to Chairman Mao."

	After reaching a consensus, they agreed: major issues will be collectively studied and resolved, and general issues will be handled by the eighteen non-full-time committee members in coordination with the leading cadres of their respective brigades and enterprises. They also stipulated that a regular meeting of the standing committee will be held every seven days, and a full committee meeting will be held every month to check and summarize work, and study and resolve major issues.

	Utilize the role of committee members with practical experience.

	After the non-full-time committee members of the West Mountain Commune Revolutionary Committee fully played their roles, the abilities of those with practical experience were demonstrated, and they worked very well.

	Some time ago, a few poor and lower-middle peasants in Gai Jia Yu Brigade were disrupted by class enemies and did not get along well for a long time. The non-full-time committee member of the West Mountain Commune Revolutionary Committee, Liu Guolin, coordinated with the brigade's leading cadres to organize poor and lower-middle peasants to hold Mao Zedong Thought study classes, carry out revolutionary criticism, and focus on class struggle, finally exposing the class enemies behind the scenes. As a result, the broad poor and lower-middle peasants united closely, focused on the revolution, and promoted production, making the entire brigade a new look.

	Some time ago, Jia Yu Brigade had issues such as a commune member building a pigpen and occupying collective land, and some commune members arguing over high work points while guarding sheep at night. In the past, such problems often had to be resolved at the commune level. This time, the non-full-time committee member of the brigade, Liu Pingyi, coordinated with the brigade's leading cadres to hold a Mao Zedong Thought study class. Cadres and commune members worked together to criticize selfishness and revise revisionism, and together criticized the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of the Chinese Khrushchev, and these problems were gradually resolved properly.

	In the past, when the commune distributed relief funds, there were many layers of approvals, many procedures, and it often caused dissatisfaction among the masses and grassroots cadres. Now, the commune hands over policies and quotas to the non-full-time committee members of each brigade, who coordinate with the brigade's leading cadres to rely on the poor and lower-middle peasants to solve problems using Mao Zedong Thought, and the work is done meticulously, making the broad masses satisfied.

	The West Mountain Commune Credit Union has a non-full-time committee member named Gao Jinxiong. In the past, although he lived in the commune, he rarely handled commune affairs. Now, because the commune revolutionary committee pays attention to utilizing non-full-time committee members and organizes them to study Chairman Mao's relevant instructions, Gao Jinxiong's enthusiasm for participating in the construction of political power has greatly increased. In addition to actively completing his own work, he also proactively assists the commune in propagating and implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions. When the full-time committee members of the commune go to the front line, he takes over receiving the masses, reporting and transmitting, and handling some necessary matters.

	Boldly rely on and enthusiastically help.

	The leading members of the commune revolutionary committee, in order to fully utilize the role of non-full-time committee members, adopted a bold reliance and enthusiastic help attitude. "Help" is fundamentally based on the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. A non-full-time committee member of the commune revolutionary committee and a leading cadre of Nan Zhuang Brigade, Wang Shutai, was impacted during the Cultural Revolution and did not work boldly enough. The chairman of the commune revolutionary committee, Ma Yuzhu, went to talk to him and studied Mao Zedong's works with him, raising his ideological awareness. He said: "I have been a party branch secretary for more than twenty years, and now I am given the responsibility of a committee member of the commune revolutionary committee. This is the trust of the party and the masses. In the past, due to being poisoned by the revisionist line of the Chinese Khrushchev, the masses' impact was correct. I will definitely follow Chairman Mao's words, be a diligent servant of the people for life, and pull the cart for the revolution for life." Wang Shutai is already sixty-two years old, but he always stands at the forefront of the masses in revolution and production, and was called an old hero by the masses in the anti-drought struggle.

	A non-full-time committee member of Jia Yu Brigade of the commune revolutionary committee became arrogant and complacent after being elected, participated less in labor, and spoke to the masses with a bit of arrogance. The vice-chairman of the commune revolutionary committee, Li Fenglin, took the initiative to help him, studied Chairman Mao's teachings on "All our cadres, regardless of their position, are servants of the people" with him, and used his own past mistakes to help him strictly demand of himself with Mao Zedong Thought and never detach from the masses. Since then, the attitude of this committee member has changed greatly.

	Because the non-full-time committee members of the commune revolutionary committee fully played their roles, many problems were resolved at the brigade level. In the past, commune cadres could not free up their hands to go to the countryside, but now there is usually only one person on duty in the commune, and they can still find time to go to the countryside. They deeply felt: "A thousand-pound burden is shared by many, and work becomes easier."

    精兵简政以后人少事多怎么办？西柏坡公社革委会的经验是：
    充分发挥不脱产委员的作用
    依靠群众多在基层解决问题
    本报讯　革命委员会实行精兵简政以后，人少事多怎么办？河北省平山县西柏坡公社革命委员会的一条重要经验是：充分发挥不脱产委员的作用。
    怎样加强同群众的联系？
    西柏坡公社革命委员会刚成立的时候，有八名脱产干部。实行精兵简政以后，只留革委会主任和两个副主任脱产。在人少事多的情况下，三个人一度忙于在公社机关工作，下乡和群众联系少了。上头的指示只靠开会传达，下面的情况专靠队干部上来汇报，有些问题处理得不够妥善。群众批评他们是“新机构，旧作风”。
    面对群众的批评，公社三个脱产委员坐下来反复学习毛主席的教导：“国家机关的改革，最根本的一条，就是联系群众。”“最聪明、最有才能的，是最有实践经验的战士。”他们认识到：坐办公室，脱离群众的状况必须改变。改变这种状况的一个好办法，就是充分发挥不脱产委员的作用。发挥这些同志的作用，使大量问题在基层解决，既可以加强革委会同广大群众的联系，又可以使脱产委员腾出手来下去联系群众。因此，是否重视和发挥革命群众代表的作用，这决不是一个小问题，而是要不要肃清中国赫鲁晓夫反革命修正主义路线的流毒，忠不忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的大问题。
    于是，他们在毛主席住过的地方——西柏坡村举办了公社革委会成员毛泽东思想学习班，重新学习了毛主席在西柏坡的有关著作和毛主席的最新指示：“革命委员会的基本经验有三条：一条是有革命干部的代表，一条是有军队的代表，一条是有革命群众的代表，实现了革命的三结合。”他们还参观了西柏坡革命历史纪念馆，回顾了毛主席在西柏坡的伟大革命实践。当他们再次看到毛主席当年在西柏坡和群众一块劳动用过的锄头和镰刀时，个个心情激动，热血沸腾。脱产委员检查了没有密切联系群众的缺点。不脱产委员也提高了参加政权建设的积极性。公社革委会委员、夹峪大队民兵连长刘平义说：“过去，我总认为你们是干部，俺们是社员，什么委员不委员，你们说怎么干就怎么干。今后，我一定听毛主席的话，关心国家大事，站在夹峪，想着全公社，看到全中国，共同把西柏坡公社的革命和生产抓好，为毛主席增光。”
    在统一认识以后，大家商定：凡是重大问题集体研究解决，一般问题，分别由十八名不脱产委员协同所在大队和企事业单位的领导班子去办。他们还规定每七天开一次常委碰头会，一月开一次全体委员会，检查总结工作，研究解决重大问题。
  发挥有实践经验的委员的作用
    西柏坡公社革委会的不脱产委员，充分发挥作用以后，显示出有实践经验的委员的才能，他们工作得很好。
    前段时间，盖家峪大队的一些贫下中农，由于阶级敌人的破坏，闹不团结，长时间得不到解决。公社革委会不脱产委员刘国林协同大队领导班子，组织贫下中农大办毛泽东思想学习班，开展革命大批判，狠抓阶级斗争，终于揭露出了幕后捣乱的阶级敌人。结果，广大贫下中农紧密团结起来，狠抓革命，猛促生产，全大队面貌一新。
    前些日子，夹峪大队出现了有个社员打猪圈多占了集体地基，有的夜间看羊的社员争高工分等问题。在过去，象这些问题，往往要到公社解决。这次，这个大队的公社革委会不脱产委员刘平义，协同大队领导班子举办了毛泽东思想学习班，干部和社员一块斗私批修，一块狠批中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义路线，使这些问题逐一得到妥善的解决。
    过去公社发放救济款，层层审议，手续很多，费了事还常引起群众和基层干部的不满。现在，公社把政策和指标交给各大队的公社革委会不脱产委员，由他们协同大队领导班子，依靠贫下中农，用毛泽东思想去解决，工作做得细致，广大群众满意。
    公社信用社有位公社革委会的不脱产委员，叫高进忠。过去，他虽然住在公社，但很少管公社的事。现在，由于公社革委会注意发挥不脱产委员的作用，并且组织不脱产委员学习了毛主席的有关教导，高进忠参加政权建设的积极性大为提高。他除了积极完成本职工作以外，还主动协助公社宣传和落实毛主席的最新指示。在公社革委会脱产委员下到第一线的时候，他就代为接待群众，上报下达，办理一些必需办的事宜。
  大胆依靠　热情帮助
    公社革委会领导成员为了充分发挥不脱产委员的作用，采取了大胆依靠，热情帮助的态度。“帮”，最根本的就是靠战无不胜的毛泽东思想。公社革委会不脱产委员、南庄大队领导班子负责人之一王树太，由于在文化大革命中受过冲击，工作不够大胆。公社革委会主任马玉珠就去找他谈心，和他一块学习毛主席著作，使他提高了思想觉悟。他说：“我一连当了二十多年党支部书记，现在又让我负起了公社革委会委员的责任，这是党和群众对自己的信任。过去，由于自己中了中国赫鲁晓夫修正主义的流毒，群众冲击冲击是对的。我一定听毛主席的话，为人民当一辈子老黄牛，为革命拉一辈子车。”王树太今年已是六十二岁了，但在革命、生产中始终站在群众头里，在抗旱斗争中被群众称为老英雄。
    夹峪大队的一位公社革委会不脱产委员，当选以后，产生了骄傲自满情绪，参加劳动少了，和群众说话也有点气粗了。公社革委会副主任李风林便主动帮助他，和他一块学习毛主席关于“我们一切工作干部，不论职位高低，都是人民的勤务员”的教导，并用自己过去犯错误的沉痛教训，帮助他用毛泽东思想严格要求自己，千万不要脱离群众。从此，这位委员的作风有了很大转变。
    由于公社革委会不脱产委员充分发挥了作用，许多问题在大队就解决了。过去，公社干部腾不开手脚下乡，现在经常在公社值班的只有一个人，还能抽空下乡。他们深有体会地说：“千斤担子众人挑，工作就好做了。”（附图片）
