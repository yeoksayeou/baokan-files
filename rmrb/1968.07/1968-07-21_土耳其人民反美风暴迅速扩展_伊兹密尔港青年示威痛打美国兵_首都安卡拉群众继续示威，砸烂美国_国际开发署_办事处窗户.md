The anti-American demonstration wave recently launched by the Turkish people has expanded to a third city, Izmir Port, on July 19.

According to reports from Izmir, a group of American sailors who had come ashore for a "rest" were beaten up.

The report said that Turkish youth demonstrators attacked these American sailors. Later, the Turkish authorities hurriedly dispatched police to suppress the demonstration.

On the same day, residents of Ankara continued to demonstrate, and the demonstrators smashed the windows of the office of the American aggression agency, the "International Development Agency."

It has been previously reported that since July 15, when a batch of ships from the U.S. Sixth Fleet arrived at Turkish ports for a "visit," there have been many anti-American demonstrations in Istanbul and Ankara. The Turkish people angrily threw eggs and ink at American officials and soldiers, and smashed the windows of American aggression agencies with stones. They also beat up American sailors who came ashore. According to the official announcement from the U.S., by July 18, 35 American sailors had been injured. The U.S. Embassy in Turkey demanded that the Turkish government "protect" American sailors, and on July 18, the Turkish authorities dispatched troops and police to seal off the docking area of Istanbul Port.
