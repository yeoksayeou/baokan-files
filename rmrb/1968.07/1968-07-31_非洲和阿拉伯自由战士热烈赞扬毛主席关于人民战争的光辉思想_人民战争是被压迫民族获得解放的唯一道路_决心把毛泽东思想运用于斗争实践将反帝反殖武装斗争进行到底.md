African and Arab freedom fighters in Cairo, while celebrating the 41st anniversary of the founding of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, warmly praised Chairman Mao's brilliant thoughts on people's war and expressed their determination to carry out armed struggles against imperialism and colonialism to the end.

They recently told a correspondent of Xinhua News Agency in Cairo that they unanimously wish long life and good health to the great leader and teacher of the Chinese people and the people of the world, the founder and commander-in-chief of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, Chairman Mao Zedong!

An African freedom fighter from southern Africa said in Cairo on July 29, "The Chinese People's Liberation Army, holding high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, is waging a heroic revolutionary struggle against imperialism and domestic reactionaries and has set a brilliant example in practicing Mao Zedong's theory of people's war. The African people are waging a struggle against imperialism and old and new colonialism. They can draw good experience from the Chinese People's Liberation Army and apply it according to their own situation, thereby winning one victory after another over the enemy."

He added, "The African people have realized that only through armed struggle can they completely eliminate imperialism and old and new colonialism. Undoubtedly, people's war is the highest form of struggle. Chairman Mao teaches us: 'Political power grows out of the barrel of a gun.' 'The central task and highest form of the revolution is to seize political power through armed struggle and solve problems through war.' These teachings have now deeply penetrated the minds of African freedom fighters. The African people are determined to apply Chairman Mao's teachings in their armed struggle to liberate their countries."

An Angolan freedom fighter told the correspondent on July 29, "Chairman Mao Zedong's brilliant thoughts on people's war are our best weapon and the true source of strength for the revolutionary people of the world in their struggle against imperialism, colonialism, and racism. Chairman Mao teaches us: 'The people, and the people alone, are the motive force in the making of world history.' 'We advocate self-reliance. We hope to have foreign aid, but we cannot depend on it. We depend on our own efforts and on the creative power of the entire army and people.' These teachings have given us great encouragement. The Angolan people are, according to Chairman Mao's teachings, intensifying their armed struggle—the only road to our freedom—and determining the history of our nation."

A freedom fighter from Mozambique in Cairo said, "The people of Mozambique have realized through their struggle for freedom that people's war is the only road to independence. The great Chinese people, led by Chairman Mao, liberated their country through people's war. The heroic Vietnamese people, relying on people's war, are defeating the U.S. aggressors. We, the people of Mozambique, insist on people's war and will certainly defeat the Portuguese colonialists supported by U.S. imperialism."

Yusuf Alavi, representative of the Dhofar Liberation Front in Cairo, told Xinhua News Agency correspondent on July 29:

"Chairman Mao's works on people's war are our guide in our armed struggle against U.S.-British imperialism for national liberation. Many guerrillas in Dhofar are reading Chairman Mao's books. We believe that Chairman Mao's books are a must-read for every true anti-imperialist fighter."

He said, "The Dhofar Liberation Front and its guerrillas, learning from Chairman Mao's teachings, pay great attention to strengthening their close ties with the people. Relying on the unity of the army and the people, we have defeated the British colonialist army's repeated so-called 'sweeping operations,' consolidating and expanding the liberated areas. Now, a revolutionary government has been established in the mountainous areas. The enemy is now forced to defend a few major cities and coastal areas surrounded by vast rural areas. We will intensify our armed struggle until we finally liberate our motherland."

    非洲和阿拉伯自由战士热烈赞扬毛主席关于人民战争的光辉思想
    人民战争是被压迫民族获得解放的唯一道路
    决心把毛泽东思想运用于斗争实践将反帝反殖武装斗争进行到底
    新华社开罗三十日电驻在开罗的非洲和阿拉伯自由战士在祝贺中国人民解放军建军四十一周年的时候，热烈赞扬毛主席关于人民战争的光辉思想，并决心把反对帝国主义、殖民主义的武装斗争进行到底。
    他们最近在同新华社驻开罗记者谈话时，一致祝愿中国人民和世界革命人民的伟大导师和伟大领袖、中国人民解放军的缔造者和统帅毛主席万寿无疆！
    一位来自非洲南部的自由战士二十九日在开罗说：“中国人民解放军高举毛泽东思想革命红旗，进行着反对帝国主义和国内反动派的英勇的革命斗争，在实践毛泽东的人民战争的理论方面树立了光辉的榜样。非洲人民正在进行反对帝国主义和新老殖民主义的斗争，他们能够从中国人民解放军那里汲取良好的经验，并根据自己的情况加以运用，从而取得对敌人的一个又一个的胜利。”
    他接着说：“非洲人民已认识到，只有通过武装斗争，他们才能完全清除帝国主义和新老殖民主义。毫无疑问，人民战争是斗争的最高形式。毛主席教导我们：‘枪杆子里面出政权’。‘革命的中心任务和最高形式是武装夺取政权，是战争解决问题。’这些教导，今天已在非洲自由战士中深入人心。非洲人民决心在自己的武装斗争中运用毛主席的这些教导，以解放他们的国家。”
    一位来自安哥拉的自由战士二十九日向记者说：“毛泽东主席关于人民战争的光辉思想是我们所拥有的最好的武器，是世界革命人民对帝国主义、殖民主义和种族主义进行斗争的真正的力量源泉。毛主席教导我们：‘人民，只有人民，才是创造世界历史的动力。’‘我们是主张自力更生的。我们希望有外援，但是我们不能依赖它，我们依靠自己的努力，依靠全体军民的创造力。’这些教导，给了我们巨大的鼓舞。我们安哥拉人民正在按照毛主席的教导，加紧进行武装斗争——这是我们获得自由的唯一道路——和决定我们民族的历史。”
    驻在开罗的一位莫三鼻给自由战士说：“莫三鼻给人民从自由的斗争中认识到，人民战争是获得独立的唯一道路。毛主席领导的伟大的中国人民通过人民战争解放了自己的国家。英雄的越南人民依靠人民战争，正在打败美国侵略者。我们莫三鼻给人民坚持人民战争，定将打败美帝国主义所支持的葡萄牙殖民主义者。”
    佐法尔解放阵线驻开罗代表优素福·阿勒维二十九日对新华社记者说：
  “毛主席关于人民战争的著作，是我们进行反对美英帝国主义，争取民族解放的武装斗争的指南。佐法尔的许多游击战士正在读毛主席的书，我们认为，毛主席的书，是每一个真正的反帝战士的必修课。”
    他说：“佐法尔解放阵线和它的游击队，学习毛主席的教导，非常注意加强他们同人民的紧密关系。我们依靠军民团结，打败了英国殖民主义军队一再进行的所谓扫荡行动，巩固和扩大了解放区。现在，在山区里已经建立了佐法尔革命政权。敌人现在已被迫据守被广大农村地区所包围的少数大城市和沿海地区。我们将加紧武装斗争，直到最后解放我们的祖国。”
