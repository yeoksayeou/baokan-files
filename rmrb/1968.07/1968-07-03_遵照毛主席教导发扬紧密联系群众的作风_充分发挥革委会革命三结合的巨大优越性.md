Members of revolutionary committees across the country and hundreds of millions of soldiers and civilians, in the joyous days of celebrating Chairman Mao's reception of revolutionary fighters and the 47th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China, are continuing to deeply study the "July 1" editorial. They are determined to launch a new high tide in the mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, earnestly implement the battle call of the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, resolutely protect the broad masses of the people, and accurately and forcefully strike at a handful of class enemies. They will strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat and, in the class struggle, consolidate and develop the revolutionary committees.

New China News Agency, July 2 -- Under the inspiration of the great news that Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin received revolutionary fighters from various places again, and in the glorious days of celebrating the 47th anniversary of the great, glorious, and correct Communist Party of China, members of revolutionary committees across the country and hundreds of millions of soldiers and civilians are determined to launch a new high tide in the mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought. They will resolutely implement Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, carry forward the fine style of the Party's close ties with the masses cultivated by Chairman Mao, and build the newly born revolutionary committees into revolutionary, authoritative, and vibrant proletarian command headquarters.

Members of revolutionary committees across the country and hundreds of millions of soldiers and civilians, in the joyous moment of celebrating Chairman Mao's reception and the Party's birthday, continue to deeply study the "July 1" editorial in "People's Daily," "Red Flag" magazine, and "Liberation Army Daily." They are determined to earnestly implement the new battle call of the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin. In the process of study, everyone has a deeper understanding that carrying forward the Party's style of close ties with the masses and building the newly born revolutionary committees according to the direction indicated by the great leader Chairman Mao has extremely important practical significance and far-reaching historical significance. They say that consolidating and developing the newly born revolutionary committees is necessary to consolidate and develop the great victories already achieved in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, to seize the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, to further strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat, and to ensure that our proletarian state will never change color.

Study and apply Mao Zedong Thought, grasp the fundamentals among countless tasks

Vice Chairman Lin instructs us: "Mao Zedong Thought is always the first and decisive factor in any work, the soul, and the lifeline. With it, everything will be smooth, the banner will be clear, and the direction will be correct." Members of revolutionary committees at all levels across the country deeply feel from their own struggles that the newly born revolutionary committees have countless tasks, but the most fundamental, most important, and most glorious task is to lead the broad revolutionary masses to study and apply Mao Zedong Thought and resolutely implement Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Only in this way can the newly born revolutionary committees be built into command headquarters that will never deviate from the track of Mao Zedong Thought, never deviate from the masses, and always maintain revolutionary vigor. Members of the revolutionary committee of the Beijing Knitting Factory said, "Every victory we have achieved is a victory of Mao Zedong Thought and Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Mao Zedong Thought is our lifeline. We must put the study and application of Chairman Mao's works in the first place in all our work, continue to hold and run various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, and build the revolutionary committee into a revolutionary command headquarters that is infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, infinitely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line." Members of the Liaoning Provincial Revolutionary Committee said, "The revolutionary committees were born under the guidance of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought and Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. To consolidate and develop the revolutionary committees, we must better study and apply Mao Zedong Thought and adhere to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. This is the fundamental principle." Members of the revolutionary committees of the Harbin New Wind Processing Factory and the Harbin Tractor Parts Factory pointed out that the closer the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is to comprehensive victory, the more complex and profound the class struggle becomes. We must continuously push the mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought to new stages, so that the broad revolutionary masses can truly master Mao Zedong Thought, become more clear-sighted, and remain unshakable in the complex class struggle. They will not waver at critical moments and will be victorious in every battle. Military representatives participating in the Qinghai Provincial Revolutionary Committee said, "Our Party's 47 years of struggle practice have proven that great Mao Zedong Thought is the only correct guideline for the Chinese revolution and the fundamental guarantee of our victory. We must take Comrade Deng as an example, study and apply Mao Zedong Thought as if we are starving and thirsty, continuously improve our awareness of line struggle, and always stand guard, fight, and be loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line as vanguard fighters of the proletariat." Members of the revolutionary committee of the Shandong Xiaoqing River Navigation Bureau pointed out that among countless tasks, only by grasping the fundamentals and firmly grasping the study and application of Mao Zedong Thought can we avoid losing our direction. We must better study and apply Mao Zedong Thought, continue to hold and run various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, and turn the Xiaoqing River Navigation Bureau into a red Mao Zedong Thought school.

Protect the people and suppress the enemy, firmly grasp the class struggle and not waver

The great leader Chairman Mao recently pointed out profoundly: "Whether to protect or suppress the broad masses of the people is the fundamental difference between the Communist Party and the Kuomintang, the fundamental difference between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, and the fundamental difference between the dictatorship of the proletariat and the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie." Members of revolutionary committees across the country reviewed Chairman Mao's latest instructions in connection with their own struggles. They said that the task of the proletarian dictatorship is to suppress the enemy and protect the people. We must further carry forward the Party's style of close ties with the masses, mobilize the broad revolutionary masses more fully, firmly grasp the class struggle, always direct the struggle at a handful of die-hard class enemies, traitors, spies, and unrepentant landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, correctly distinguish between the two types of contradictions, accurately and forcefully strike at a handful of class enemies, effectively strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat, and most resolutely protect the revolutionary enthusiasm of the broad masses of the people. In the struggle, we will establish the revolutionary authority of the revolutionary committees. Members of the revolutionary committee of the Jiangxi Electric Machinery Factory said, "The process of establishing the revolutionary committee is a process of serious class struggle. The process of consolidating and developing the revolutionary committee is also a process of serious class struggle. A handful of class enemies are not reconciled and will try to reverse the verdict and plot a comeback at any opportunity. We must firmly grasp the class struggle, lead the broad revolutionary masses to launch unrelenting and fierce attacks on the class enemies, thoroughly smash their plots, protect the rights of the people, and continuously consolidate the newly born revolutionary committees." Comrades from the Shaoguan Special District Revolutionary Committee of Guangdong Province said that they must firmly remember Chairman Mao's great teachings of "never forgetting class struggle," and ensure that no matter how tasks change, the direction of firmly grasping class struggle will not change; no matter how busy the work is, firmly grasping revolutionary criticism will not be neglected. Members of the standing committee of the Xiyang County Revolutionary Committee of Shanxi Province pointed out at a meeting to study and implement the spirit of the "July 1" editorial that they must resolutely rely on and protect the people, strike at a handful of class enemies, and build the revolutionary committee into a power organ that represents the fundamental interests of the people. Members of the revolutionary committee of Shanghai Tire Factory No. 1 emphasized that only by closely relying on the broad revolutionary masses, accurately and forcefully striking at a handful of class enemies, and fully utilizing the great power of mass dictatorship, can we thoroughly smash the sabotage plots of the class enemies and continuously consolidate and develop the newly born revolutionary committees.

Be a cow for the people for life, pull the revolutionary cart for life

The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "The basic experience of the revolutionary committees is threefold: one is the representation of revolutionary cadres, one is the representation of the military, and one is the representation of revolutionary masses, realizing the three-in-one combination of the revolution. The revolutionary committees should implement unified leadership, break down overlapping administrative organs, streamline and downsize, and organize a revolutionary and people-oriented leadership team." Members of revolutionary committees at all levels in all provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions across the country are determined to follow Chairman Mao's instructions, fully utilize the great advantages of the revolutionary three-in-one combination committees, inherit and carry forward the Party's fine style of close ties with the masses, and make the revolutionary committees deeply rooted among the people, forever maintaining revolutionary vigor.

The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Revolutionary Committee held an expanded meeting of the standing committee and seriously studied the important "July 1" editorial. Everyone said that we have achieved great victories in the struggle to seize power from a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party by relying on the broad revolutionary masses. To develop and consolidate this great victory, to consolidate and develop the newly born revolutionary committees, we must still rely on the broad revolutionary masses, forever maintain close ties with the masses, and humbly accept the criticism and supervision of the masses. After the establishment of the revolutionary committee of the Jiangxi Pharmaceutical Factory, the members of the revolutionary committee resolutely implemented Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, trusted the masses in everything, consulted the masses on every matter, actively participated in socialist labor, and were praised by the workers. After studying the "July 1" editorial, they excitedly expressed: The newly born revolutionary committees come from the masses and represent the masses. We must forever be rooted among the masses and forever maintain blood ties with the masses. Revolutionary mass representatives participating in various levels of revolutionary committees in Anshan said that they must implement Chairman Mao's consistent teachings and the spirit of the "July 1" editorial in action, resolutely do the following: even if the position changes, the ordinary laborer's nature will never change; even if the job changes, the style of close ties with the masses will never change. Members of the revolutionary committees of Hubei Province and Wuhan City emphasized in their study and discussion that members of the revolutionary committees, regardless of their origin, should be representatives of the broad revolutionary masses. We must use great Mao Zedong Thought to criticize the influence of bourgeois ideas such as individualism, factionalism, cliquism, and sectarianism, and wholeheartedly serve the people. We must be like the good cadre Comrade Deng, who is infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, be a cow for the people for life, and pull the revolutionary cart for life.

The rights obtained by the people must be defended with struggle

The great leader Chairman Mao teaches: "The rights obtained by the people must not be allowed to be easily lost and must be defended with struggle." Hundreds of millions of soldiers and civilians across the country, in the solemn commemoration of the Party's glorious birthday, are determined to follow Chairman Mao's great teachings, resolutely smash all the tricks and plots of a handful of class enemies who attempt to sabotage and overthrow the revolutionary committees, defend the newly born revolutionary committees with struggle, and consolidate and develop the newly born revolutionary committees. Comrades from the workers' and red guards' congresses in Hefei said that the newly born revolutionary committees are new things born in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution personally initiated and led by our great leader Chairman Mao. We proletarian revolutionaries resolutely support it, cherish it, and help it to consolidate and develop in the storms of class struggle. We must always be vigilant and resolutely smash the rightist reversal wind and the evil plots of class enemies to sow discord. We must defend the newly born revolutionary committees with struggle. Revolutionary workers on the industrial front in Shijiazhuang pointed out with great enthusiasm that the newly born revolutionary committees have carried forward the glorious traditions and fine styles of the Party, have the closest ties with the broad masses of the people, and can best protect the revolutionary enthusiasm of the broad masses of the people. We must, under the leadership of the revolutionary committees, carry out revolutionary criticism more deeply and persistently, accurately and forcefully strike at a handful of class enemies, seize the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through revolution and production. Broad cadres and fighters on the front lines of "three supports and two militaries" across the country said: The newly born revolutionary committees are supported by Chairman Mao, and we are the people's army personally created by Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao supports us, and we support. We must enthusiastically cherish the revolutionary committees, actively support the revolutionary committees, bravely defend the revolutionary committees, and for the consolidation and development of the revolutionary committees, for the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, create new achievements.

    各地革命委员会成员和亿万军民，在欢呼毛主席接见和纪念党的生日的欢乐时刻，继续深入学习《人民日报》、《红旗》杂志、《解放军报》“七一”社论《发扬党的紧密联系群众的作风》，决心认真贯彻以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的新的战斗号召。在学习中，大家更加深刻地认识到，发扬党的紧密联系群众的作风，按照伟大领袖毛主席指引的方向建设好新生的革命委员会，具有极其重大的现实意义和深远的历史意义。他们说，巩固和发展新生的革命委员会，是巩固和发展无产阶级文化大革命已经取得的伟大胜利的需要，是夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的需要，是进一步加强无产阶级专政的需要，也是保证我们的无产阶级江山永不变色的需要。
    活学活用毛泽东思想，千头万绪抓根本
    林副主席指示我们：“毛泽东思想是在任何工作中永远是第一位的，是起决定作用的，是灵魂，是命根子。有了它就一通百通，旗帜鲜明，方向正确。”各地各级革命委员会成员从自己的斗争实践中深刻地体会到，新生的革命委员会工作千头万绪，最根本、最重要、最光荣的任务就是带领广大革命群众活学活用毛泽东思想，坚决贯彻执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。只有这样，才能把新生的革委会建设成为永远不脱离毛泽东思想的轨道，永远不脱离群众，永远保持革命青春的朝气蓬勃的战斗指挥部。北京针织总厂的革委会成员说，我们所取得的每一个胜利，都是毛泽东思想和毛主席革命路线的胜利。毛泽东思想是我们的命根子。我们一定要把活学活用毛主席著作放在一切工作的首位，继续大办、办好各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，把革委会建设成为无限忠于毛主席、无限忠于毛泽东思想、无限忠于毛主席革命路线的革命战斗指挥部。辽宁省革委会成员说，革命委员会是在战无不胜的毛泽东思想和毛主席革命路线指引下诞生的，要巩固和发展革命委员会，必须更好地活学活用毛泽东思想，坚持毛主席的革命路线，这是根本的根本。哈尔滨新风加工厂和哈尔滨拖拉机配件厂的革委会成员指出，无产阶级文化大革命越接近全面胜利，阶级斗争越是复杂，越是深刻。我们只有把活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动不断推向新的阶段，让广大革命群众真正把毛泽东思想学到手，才能更加心明眼亮，在复杂的阶级斗争中不动摇，在关键的时刻不转向，百战百胜。参加青海省革委会的军队代表说，我们党四十七年的斗争实践证明，伟大的毛泽东思想是中国革命唯一正确的指针，是我们取得胜利的根本保证。我们一定要以门合同志为榜样，如饥似渴地活学活用毛泽东思想，不断提高路线斗争觉悟，时刻为捍卫毛主席的革命路线放好哨，站好岗，打好仗，作无限忠于毛主席革命路线的无产阶级先锋战士。山东小清河航运局的革委会成员指出，在千头万绪中只有狠抓根本，狠抓活学活用毛泽东思想，才不会迷失方向。我们一定要更好地活学活用毛泽东思想，继续大办、办好各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，把小清河航运局办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校。
    保护人民镇压敌人，狠抓阶级斗争不转向
    伟大领袖毛主席最近极其深刻地指出：“对广大人民群众是保护还是镇压，是共产党同国民党的根本区别，是无产阶级同资产阶级的根本区别，是无产阶级专政同资产阶级专政的根本区别。”各地革命委员会成员结合自己的斗争实践，重温了毛主席的这一最新指示。他们说，无产阶级政权的任务就是要镇压敌人，保护人民。我们一定要进一步发扬党的紧密联系群众的作风，更加充分地把广大革命人民群众发动起来，狠抓阶级斗争，始终把斗争矛头对准一小撮顽固不化的走资派、叛徒、特务以及没有改造好的地、富、反、坏、右分子，正确区分两类不同性质的矛盾，稳、准、狠地打击一小撮阶级敌人，有效地加强无产阶级专政，最坚决地保护广大人民群众的革命积极性，在斗争中树立起革命委员会的无产阶级革命权威。江西电机厂革命委员会成员说，革命委员会成立的过程，是一个严重的阶级斗争的过程。巩固和发展革命委员会的过程，也是一个严重的阶级斗争的过程。一小撮阶级敌人是不死心的，他们一有机会就妄想翻案，阴谋复辟。我们一定要狠抓阶级斗争，带领广大革命群众向阶级敌人发动不停顿的猛烈进攻，彻底粉碎他们的阴谋，保卫人民得到的权利，不断巩固新生的革命委员会。广东省韶关专区革委会的同志们表示，一定要牢牢记住毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的伟大教导，做到任务千变万变，狠抓阶级斗争的方向不变；工作千忙万忙，狠抓革命大批判不放。山西省昔阳县革命委员会的常委们在学习和贯彻“七一”社论精神的会议上指出，我们一定要坚决依靠和保护人民群众，狠狠打击一小撮阶级敌人，把革委会建设成为代表群众根本利益的权力机构。上海轮胎一厂革委会成员强调指出，我们只有紧紧依靠广大革命群众，稳、准、狠地打击一小撮阶级敌人，充分发挥群众专政的巨大威力，彻底粉碎阶级敌人的破坏阴谋，才能不断巩固和发展新生的革命委员会。
    当一辈子人民的牛，拉一辈子革命的车
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“革命委员会的基本经验有三条：一条是有革命干部的代表，一条是有军队的代表，一条是有革命群众的代表，实现了革命的三结合。革命委员会要实行一元化的领导，打破重叠的行政机构，精兵简政，组织起一个革命化的联系群众的领导班子。”全国各省、市、自治区各级革命委员会成员决心遵照毛主席的教导，充分发挥三结合的革命委员会的巨大优越性，继承和发扬党的密切联系群众的优良作风，使革命委员会深深地扎根于群众之中，永葆革命的青春。
    内蒙古自治区革命委员会召开常委扩大会议，认真学习了“七一”重要社论。大家说，我们紧紧依靠广大革命人民群众，取得了向党内一小撮走资派夺权斗争的巨大胜利。要发展和巩固已经取得的这个伟大胜利，巩固和发展新生的革命委员会，仍然要紧紧依靠广大革命人民群众，永远同群众保持紧密的联系，虚心接受群众的批评和监督。江西制药厂革命委员会成立后，革委会成员坚决贯彻毛主席的革命路线，处处相信群众，遇事同群众商量，积极参加社会主义生产劳动，受到工人的称赞。他们学习了“七一”社论后激动地表示：新生的革命委员会来自群众，代表群众，我们一定要永远扎根于群众，永远保持和群众的血肉联系。参加鞍钢各级革委会的革命群众代表表示，一定要把毛主席的一贯教导和“七一”社论的精神落实到行动中，坚决做到：地位变了，普通劳动者的本色永不变；职务变了，密切联系群众的作风永不变。湖北省和武汉市革命委员会的成员在学习讨论中强调指出，革委会成员不管来自那一个方面，都应当是广大革命人民群众的代表。我们必须用伟大的毛泽东思想批判个人主义、山头主义、小团体主义、宗派主义等资产阶级思想的影响，做到全心全意地为人民服务，象无限忠于毛主席革命路线的好干部门合同志那样，当一辈子人民的牛，拉一辈子革命的车。
    人民得到的权利，必须用战斗来保卫
    伟大领袖毛主席教导说：“人民得到的权利，绝不允许轻易丧失，必须用战斗来保卫。”全国亿万军民在隆重纪念党的光辉生日的时候，决心遵循毛主席的这一伟大教导，坚决粉碎一小撮阶级敌人妄图破坏和颠覆革命委员会的一切阴谋诡计，用战斗来保卫新生的革命委员会，巩固和发展新生的革命委员会。合肥市工代会和红代会的同志们说，新生的革命委员会是在我们伟大领袖毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命中产生的新生事物，我们无产阶级革命派坚决支持它，爱护它，帮助它，让它在阶级斗争的大风大浪中不断巩固和发展。我们一定要时刻提高革命的警惕性，坚决粉碎阶级敌人刮起的右倾翻案妖风，坚决粉碎阶级敌人挑拨离间的罪恶阴谋，用战斗来巩固和发展新生的革命委员会。石家庄工业战线上的广大革命职工，在纪念党的光辉生日的时候满腔热情地指出，新生的革命委员会发扬了党的光荣传统和优良作风，同广大人民群众联系最紧密，最能保护广大人民群众的革命积极性。我们一定要在革命委员会的领导下，更深入持久地开展革命的大批判，稳、准、狠地打击一小撮阶级敌人，抓革命，促生产，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。战斗在各地“三支”“两军”第一线的广大指战员说：新生的革命委员会是毛主席支持的，我们是毛主席亲手缔造的人民军队。毛主席支持我支持。我们一定要热情地爱护革命委员会，积极地支持革命委员会，勇敢地捍卫革命委员会，为革命委员会的巩固和发展，为夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利，建立新功。
