The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "The movement is developing, and there are new things ahead. New things are endless. Studying the full scope of this movement and its development is a major topic we must always pay attention to."

Our unit is a transport boat squadron responsible for maritime transport tasks. The boats have a small tonnage, often operate in dispersed formations, and have heavy tasks, high mobility, and difficult working and living conditions. Previously, we thought: For a small transport boat squadron like ours, being able to generally complete the tasks would be good enough. After the Four Good Units movement was launched in the army, our work had specific and clear goals, and our morale was different. Starting from 1962, our unit has been consecutively rated as a Four Good Unit for five years.

In the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the struggle between the two classes, the two lines, and the two roads is extremely sharp and complex. The new situation presents us with new requirements. How to raise the Four Good Units movement to a higher level in the new situation and further build our unit according to Chairman Mao's military line is a new task facing us. Over the past two years, we have accumulated some experience and gained some shallow understanding in our work and struggle.

The attitude towards the Four Good Units movement
is the attitude towards Chairman Mao's military line

Whether to persist with or oppose the Four Good Units movement has long been an important part of the struggle between the two military lines.

The great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin have always attached great importance to the construction of the grassroots level in the army and to doing a good job in the work of the units. The Four Good Units movement proposed by Vice Chairman Lin is a fundamental strategic measure to build units according to Chairman Mao's military line. For this reason, the Chinese Khrushchev and the counter-revolutionary revisionist element Luo Ruiqing have always opposed the Four Good Units movement, attempting to obstruct and sabotage the development of this movement. In the new situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, some comrades, due to the influence of the bourgeois military line in their minds not being completely eliminated and being affected by the reactionary trend of "doubt everything, negate everything," have had doubts about the Four Good Units movement at times. In the latter half of 1966, one of our boats was far from the leadership of the Party branch and had been on solo duty for a long time. Because some cadres on the boat had doubts about the Four Good Units movement and abandoned the leadership of this movement, the boat soon showed signs of tense relations and lax discipline, causing losses to the work.

In the process of checking and rectifying the work of this boat, we deeply felt: In the situation where class struggle and line struggle are extremely sharp and complex, whether we can steadfastly carry forward the Four Good Units movement and create new levels of the Four Good Units in the new situation is a major issue of defending and implementing Chairman Mao's military line, and it is a major issue of continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat and closely following Chairman Mao.

Vice Chairman Lin instructs us: "We must hold on to the Four Good Units and definitely achieve results in the Four Good Units, and build the units well." Following Vice Chairman Lin's instructions, in the 1966 Four Good Units comprehensive evaluation, in implementing the Navy Party Committee's movement to carry out education on Chairman Mao's military line, we launched a major campaign, propaganda, and discussion on carrying out the Four Good Units movement in the new situation throughout the unit. Comrades re-studied the resolutions of the Gutian Conference and the 1960 Military Commission Enlarged Meeting's "Resolution on Strengthening Political and Ideological Work in the Army," and once again severely criticized the reactionary military line of the bourgeoisie, correcting the erroneous thoughts of doubting the Four Good Units movement. Through study and criticism, comrades further realized: The Four Good Units movement is the product of Chairman Mao's military line defeating the reactionary military line of the bourgeoisie, and it is Vice Chairman Lin's defense and development of Chairman Mao's military line. It is a fundamental measure to implement Chairman Mao's military line and Vice Chairman Lin's set of principles emphasizing political construction in the grassroots, turning our army into a big school of Mao Zedong Thought. According to which line to build our units is the focus of the struggle between the two military lines. Carrying out the Four Good Units movement is to build the army according to Chairman Mao's military line, making our army forever advance along Chairman Mao's revolutionary line; opposing and sabotaging the Four Good Units movement is to attempt to lead the construction of our units onto the reactionary military line of the bourgeoisie.

In the discussion, comrades also reviewed the history of our unit's growth in the Four Good Units movement:

In 1963, some people were influenced by the reactionary military line of the bourgeoisie and spread the idea in our unit that "transport boats are mainly for transport, and if the transport tasks are not completed, everything else is in vain." We refuted this idea through the Four Good Units inspection, pointing out that this idea is essentially a rehash of what Chairman Mao had already refuted in the Gutian Conference resolution, that is, "if the military is good, the politics will naturally be good." We insisted on putting "political and ideological work" in the first place in our work, implementing Chairman Mao's great teaching that "politics is the commander, is the soul."

In 1964, the evil wind of mass military exercises blew into our unit. In carrying out the Four Good Units movement, we mobilized cadres and soldiers to launch a new high tide of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, establishing the "daily reading" system, and the "three unyielding" principles: not yielding to heavy tasks, not yielding to long voyages, and not yielding to strong typhoons, effectively resisting this evil wind.

In 1965, Luo Ruiqing's reactionary fallacy of "military and politics taking turns to stand out" spread to our unit, and some comrades were also influenced, thinking: "Our unit has a foundation for emphasizing politics. Now there are many new boats and new cadres, so we should first focus on technology." We repeatedly inspected and implemented Vice Chairman Lin's instructions on emphasizing proletarian politics during the continuous mobilization for the Four Good Units, educating new boats and new cadres to emphasize politics, thus eliminating the influence of conciliationism and ensuring the implementation of Chairman Mao's military line.

In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the new situation of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines has not only not reduced the great significance of carrying out the Four Good Units movement, but has further proven that the Four Good Units movement has extremely strong vitality. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has raised higher requirements and higher standards for the Four Good Units movement; the storms of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines have opened up a broad horizon for creating high-level, solid Four Good Units. Any wavering in the Four Good Units movement is extremely wrong and must be thoroughly criticized.

We deeply feel: The attitude towards the Four Good Units movement is the attitude towards Chairman Mao's military line. Any doubt or wavering about the Four Good Units movement is a doubt or wavering about Chairman Mao's military line. We must resolutely implement Chairman Mao's military line, and with the development of the class struggle situation, continuously push our Four Good Units movement forward and continuously create higher levels of Four Good Units.

Building a combat collective that is absolutely loyal to Chairman Mao
is the fundamental purpose of carrying out the Four Good Units movement

What is the fundamental purpose of carrying out the Four Good Units movement? In the new situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we have further raised our awareness and self-consciousness through continuous practice. The advanced deeds of Deputy Boat Commander Wu Shulin have given us great inspiration.

Last spring, Wu Shulin's father was critically ill, and his wife also had a serious illness. The organization approved his return home to take care of them. When he arrived in his hometown, he saw that class enemies were frantically sabotaging production, the brigade's production had no one to manage, and many fields that needed to be sown and nursed seedlings were untouched. He thought: Personal matters, no matter how big, are small matters; defending Chairman Mao's revolutionary line is the big matter! Therefore, he unhesitatingly handed over his wife and father to his sister to take care of, and the next day after returning home, he joined the poor and lower-middle peasants to fight against the class enemies' sabotage activities. He led the way in labor during the day and conducted investigations and interviews door-to-door at night, and also studied Chairman Mao's theory, line, policy, method, and policy of continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat with questions in mind. He armed his thoughts with Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, understood the class struggle situation, and stood out to expose the class enemies' heinous crimes of pushing the reactionary line of the bourgeoisie. At the same time, he carried out ideological mobilization for revolutionary cadres, helping them stand up to lead production. He stayed in his hometown for 27 days and fought hard with the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants for 23 days. As a result, the class enemies were severely struck, revolutionary cadres took up the heavy responsibility of carrying out the revolution and promoting production, the broad masses of community members organized to study Mao Zedong Thought, and class consciousness rapidly increased. The revolutionary and production situation of the brigade underwent great changes.

In the sharp and complex class struggle and the struggle between the two lines, why could Wu Shulin play such a great role? The fundamental reason is that he has an absolutely loyal heart to Chairman Mao. This incident made us deeply realize: In the new situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we must raise the purpose of carrying out the Four Good Units movement to the fundamental attitude towards Chairman Mao, Mao Zedong Thought, and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Building a combat collective that is absolutely loyal to Chairman Mao, Mao Zedong Thought, and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line is the fundamental purpose of our carrying out the Four Good Units movement. Therefore, the Party branch decided to launch a campaign to study Wu Shulin and create the Four Good Units for loyalty to Chairman Mao throughout the unit.

The fundamental purpose of carrying out the Four Good Units movement is not something that everyone can deeply understand at once. For loyalty to Chairman Mao to create the Four Good Units, or to create the Four Good Units for the evaluation of the Four Good Units? On this issue, some comrades understand the logic, but when they encounter specific problems, they often get confused. The No. 478 boat, which has been rated as a Four Good Unit for six consecutive years, was on a long-term mission far from the Party branch's leadership on a remote island last year, with heavy work and extremely harsh living conditions. Under these conditions, some comrades had the idea of relaxing: Life is so hard, and we are so far from the unit. No one knows about our hard work, and it's difficult to be rated as a Four Good Unit. Just get by! The Party branch seized this issue and once again educated them on creating the Four Good Units for loyalty to Chairman Mao, requiring comrades to do: Even on a small island and in a boat in the grass and mud, far from Beijing by thousands of miles, always think of Chairman Mao! Afterwards, the comrades of the No. 478 boat used every opportunity to carry out education on absolute loyalty to Chairman Mao. In the gaps between loading and unloading stones and the dozens of minutes of stopping during voyages, they also seized the time to study Chairman Mao's works and hold "three loyalties" experience-sharing meetings. The Four Good Units movement, with the fundamental purpose of being absolutely loyal to Chairman Mao, Mao Zedong Thought, and Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, was vigorously carried out on the No. 478 boat. At this time, there was a soldier on this boat who was afraid of hardship and tiredness and requested to be transferred to another boat. Should we agree to his request to transfer his work to avoid affecting the evaluation of the Four Good Units? The Party branch repeatedly discussed this issue and firmly believed that one soldier falling behind the team should be helped to catch up with the team. We must cultivate all comrades into proletarian revolutionary soldiers who are absolutely loyal to Chairman Mao. This is precisely the fundamental purpose of carrying out the Four Good Units movement. The Party branch decided: Not only should we not transfer this soldier's work, but we should also, through the correct handling of this issue, educate all the comrades on the boat to insist on the high standards of the Four Good Units and further establish the thought of creating the Four Good Units for loyalty to Chairman Mao. Therefore, all the comrades on the boat joined forces to help this soldier, and finally, this soldier quickly caught up with the team.

In the Four Good Units movement with the fundamental purpose of creating a combat collective that is absolutely loyal to Chairman Mao, the comrades of the No. 478 boat forged a heart that is absolutely loyal to Chairman Mao. In the sharp and complex class struggle and the struggle between the two lines, they stood firmly on Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and waged a tenacious struggle against the reactionary military line and military thought of the bourgeoisie. They finally, with higher standards, entered the ranks of the Four Good Units again.

Deeply and persistently carrying out the revolutionary criticism and struggle
is a powerful driving force for carrying out the Four Good Units movement

The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "One of our important tasks on the ideological front now is to carry out a criticism of revisionism." In implementing Chairman Mao's instructions, we have a relatively deep understanding: In the new situation, deeply and persistently carrying out the revolutionary criticism and struggle is a powerful driving force for carrying out the Four Good Units movement.

Since the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we have always been focusing on the revolutionary criticism and struggle. However, due to our insufficient understanding of the need to carry out the revolutionary criticism and struggle deeply and persistently, there was a period when we did not grasp it tightly. Just at this time, an incident occurred where two soldiers who formed a "red pair" did not get along. This "red pair" consisted of an old soldier and a new soldier. They originally had a good relationship, but recently they had drifted apart and started arguing. Originally, the new soldier thought that his political and ideological work was fine, and he mainly lacked technical skills; but the old soldier insisted on emphasizing proletarian politics, putting politics in the first place, and mainly talking to him about politics and ideology. In this way, the two did not get along. The Party branch believed: This is not an ordinary argument, but a reflection of the struggle between the two military lines in the soldiers. We convened a Party branch meeting for discussion. At the meeting, some cadres thought: The new soldier was worried that he could not learn the technical skills well and complete the tasks, which is very natural. The transport unit has very little time for specialized political education and military training, relying on the daily training, which cannot solve the problem. We never thought that from the argument between the two soldiers, the active thoughts of some cadres were exposed. Originally, some cadres were not proactive in military training, mainly because they thought there was little time and the problem could not be solved. This was actually the single military viewpoint at work.

This issue caused us great shock. Why did the single military and technical viewpoint, which had been repeatedly criticized and seemingly solved, reappear now? After checking and discussing, the Party branch deeply realized: To make Chairman Mao's military line and military thought deeply rooted in the minds of every comrade, to thoroughly eliminate the poison and influence of the reactionary military line and military thought of the bourgeoisie, is not something that can be done in one go. In the new situation where class struggle and the struggle between the two lines are sharp and complex, raising the awareness of the struggle between the two lines is a long-term combat task. The revolutionary criticism and struggle must not be relaxed for a moment, but must be carried out persistently and deeply. Otherwise, in the creation of the Four Good Units movement, it would be impossible to achieve "good political and ideological work" and also impossible to achieve "one good leads to three goods."

At the expanded meeting of the Party branch, we mobilized cadres to seriously study Chairman Mao's relevant instructions and discuss the importance of deeply and persistently carrying out the revolutionary criticism and struggle in the new situation. The unit commander Liu Bensheng talked about the tortuous and repeated process of his struggle against the single military and technical viewpoint in his mind over the past few years. He had greatly overcome the single military and technical viewpoint during the Navy's "Four Firsts" education, but when the counter-revolutionary revisionist element Luo Ruiqing stirred up the evil wind of mass military exercises, his single military and technical viewpoint reemerged. Before and after Chairman Mao's instruction to "participate in the criticism of the bourgeois cultural revolution at all times," there were two periods when the unit's political instructor was away, the boat's cadres were relatively new, and the sea missions were particularly heavy, but his work situation was completely different. Before Chairman Mao's instruction was issued, our unit did not carry out the revolutionary criticism and struggle, and his solution to the problem of new cadres and heavy tasks was to follow each boat closely when it went to sea, implementing "technical escort," resulting in new cadres not being able to grow quickly and problems occurring despite precautions. After implementing Chairman Mao's instruction and carrying out the revolutionary criticism and struggle, he faced the difficulties of new cadres and heavy tasks, and firmly grasped the new cadres' study and application of the "Old Three Articles," implementing "political escort," resulting in new cadres growing quickly and the tasks being completed well. Liu Bensheng deeply felt: The Chinese Khrushchev and the counter-revolutionary revisionist elements Peng Dehuai and Luo Ruiqing have been pushing a counter-revolutionary revisionist line and a reactionary military line of the bourgeoisie for many years, and their influence is very deep. If the revolutionary criticism and struggle is relaxed, the bourgeois ideology will attack. Whenever the revolutionary criticism and struggle is not firmly grasped, the bourgeois ideology will expand its territory.

A vigorous and solid revolutionary criticism and struggle campaign was launched in our unit and carried out persistently. The class consciousness and the awareness of the struggle between the two lines of the unit rapidly increased. Those cadres who did not emphasize politics before, in the revolutionary criticism and struggle, all linked their thoughts to their actual situation and deeply examined the military and technical first thought in their minds. Through the persistent carrying out of the revolutionary criticism and struggle, the ideological revolutionization of the unit was further promoted, one good led to three goods, and the Four Good Units movement of the unit continuously developed forward.

Comprehensively implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions
is the key to further carrying out the Four Good Units movement

Closely following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, comprehensively implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and continuously arming cadres and soldiers with Chairman Mao's theory, line, policy, method, and policy on continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat is a matter of decisive significance in creating new levels of the Four Good Units in the new situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Regarding this issue, we also realized and understood it through continuous practice.

Last year, after the great leader Chairman Mao issued the great call to "support the army and love the people," our unit showed two completely different situations. Some cadres on two boats thought: Supporting the army and loving the people is a glorious tradition of our Party and army for decades. Every Spring Festival, we conduct education on supporting the army and loving the people, and the army's understanding of this issue is already quite deep. Under this thinking, they did not organize in-depth study of Chairman Mao's latest instruction. As a result, these two boats, although they were with the people all day during their missions far from the unit, did not achieve any new results in improving military-civilian relations.

The situation of most boats was the opposite. They repeatedly studied and had new understandings of Chairman Mao's instruction to "support the army and love the people." They felt: At the critical moment when the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has achieved decisive victories, Chairman Mao's great call to "support the army and love the people" is of extremely important significance. Implementing Chairman Mao's latest instruction will play a decisive role in achieving the overall victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. With new leaps in understanding, new situations emerged in action. Arm the masses with Mao Zedong Thought, which is the greatest love for the people. Cadres and soldiers, through various channels and opportunities, propagated Mao Zedong Thought to the people. They rehearsed performances and often went to the docks and fishing villages to perform and propagate to the people as soon as they arrived at a place; they launched a letter-writing activity and widely propagated Chairman Mao's latest instructions to relatives and friends. Cadres and soldiers going out, visiting families, and staying in the hospital, the first task given to them on the boat was to propagate Mao Zedong Thought to the people. Chairman Mao's latest instructions entered the hearts of the people, not only raising the people's consciousness and promoting work, but also further strengthening military-civilian relations and greatly advancing the army's Four Good movement.

Through this incident, the Party branch further studied Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, discussed the great significance of Chairman Mao issuing each instruction, and everyone deeply realized: Each of Chairman Mao's latest instructions is a strategic measure in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, embodying Chairman Mao's theory, line, policy, method, and policy on continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat. Only by comprehensively implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions can we advance along the course set by Chairman Mao and achieve the overall victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution! "Politics is the commander, is the soul," seriously implementing each of Chairman Mao's latest instructions is the greatest politics. Realizing "good political and ideological work," the most fundamental and core issue is to closely follow Chairman Mao's strategic deployment and comprehensively implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions. Departing from Chairman Mao's latest instructions to create the Four Good Units will inevitably lead to the wrong path.

Our unit has a boat captain who, during his visit home, found that his sister had been deceived by class enemies and stood on the wrong side. He used Chairman Mao's latest instructions as a weapon to help her raise her awareness of the struggle between the two lines. After painstaking and meticulous ideological work, he finally helped her raise her consciousness and turn against the class enemies. In the short month of visiting home, he helped more than ten deceived masses return to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. The Party branch of the unit took his model deeds as an example and called on comrades to seriously study and implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions: "You should care about state affairs and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end!" Through learning from the advanced deeds of this boat captain, comrades' awareness of studying and implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions greatly increased, regarding closely following each of Chairman Mao's latest instructions as an important sign of being absolutely loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. As soon as Chairman Mao's latest instructions were issued, everyone immediately grasped the study, understanding, and seriously propagated and implemented them. A soldier studied the latest instruction that "holding study classes is a good method, and many problems can be solved in study classes," and wrote letters to his hometown production brigade three times, sending this latest instruction and part of Chairman Mao's works, hoping that they would immediately start the Mao Zedong Thought study classes in the brigade; soldiers who had completed their service all decided to go to the front line of class struggle in the countryside and achieve new merits for the people in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

We deeply felt: Although the cadres and soldiers of our unit did not directly undertake the "three supports, two militaries" tasks, because we paid attention to closely following Chairman Mao's latest instructions in carrying out the Four Good Units movement, actively and positively participating in the struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines, accepting education and tempering, the proletarian awareness and the awareness of the struggle between the two lines have greatly increased, and the political and ideological level has greatly increased. Many comrades deeply felt: Comprehensively implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions is the key to our further carrying out the Four Good Units movement. We must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, comprehensively implement each of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and continue to strive to create higher levels of Four Good Units!

    在阶级斗争的新形势下创出四好连队的新水平
    海军南海舰队某部运输艇中队党支部
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“运动在发展中，又有新的东西在前头，新东西是层出不穷的。研究这个运动的全面及其发展，是我们要时刻注意的大课题。”
    我们中队是担任海上运输任务的艇队。艇只吨位较小，经常分散执勤，任务繁重，流动性大，工作和生活条件都比较艰苦。以前，我们总想：象我们这样的运输小艇队，能一般完成任务就不错了。部队开展四好连队运动以后，我们的工作有了具体、明确的奋斗目标，劲头就不一样了。从一九六二年开始，我们中队连续五年被评为四好中队。
    在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命运动中，两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争异常尖锐、复杂。新的形势给我们提出了新的要求。如何在新的形势下，把我们的创造四好连队运动提到更高的水平，进一步按照毛主席的建军路线搞好我们的连队，这是摆在我们面前的新的课题。这两年，我们在工作和斗争的实践中，开始积累了一些经验，也有了一些粗浅的体会。
    对待四好连队运动的态度，就
    是对待毛主席建军路线的态度
    坚持还是反对四好连队运动，长期以来就是两条军事路线斗争的重要组成部分。
    伟大领袖毛主席和他的亲密战友林副主席，一贯非常重视部队的基层建设，非常重视搞好连队的工作。林副主席提出的创造四好连队运动，就是按照毛主席的建军路线建设连队的根本性的战略措施。正因为如此，中国赫鲁晓夫和反革命修正主义分子罗瑞卿，一贯反对四好连队运动，企图阻碍和破坏这个运动的开展。在无产阶级文化大革命的新形势下，有的同志由于头脑里资产阶级军事路线的影响没有肃清，又受到“怀疑一切、否定一切”的反动思潮的影响，对于四好连队运动一度产生过动摇。一九六六年下半年，我们中队有一艘艇，远离党支部领导，长期单独执勤。由于艇上有些干部对四好连队运动发生了怀疑，放弃了对这个运动的领导。结果，这艘艇很快就出现了关系紧张、纪律涣散的现象，给工作带来了损失。
    在检查和整顿这艘艇的工作的过程中，我们深深感到：在阶级斗争和路线斗争十分尖锐、复杂的形势下，能不能坚定不移地把四好连队运动坚持开展下去，能不能在新的形势下创出四好连队的新水平，这是捍卫和执行毛主席建军路线的大问题，是在无产阶级专政下紧跟毛主席继续革命的大问题。
    林副主席指示我们：“我们要抓住四好不放，一定要把四好搞出成绩来，把连队建设好。”遵照林副主席的指示，我们在一九六六年四好总评的时候，在贯彻海军党委关于开展毛主席建军路线教育的运动中，在全中队进行了在新形势下开展四好连队运动的大发动、大宣传、大讨论。同志们重新学习了古田会议决议和一九六○年军委扩大会议《关于加强军队政治思想工作的决议》，又一次狠狠地批判了资产阶级的反动军事路线，纠正了怀疑四好连队运动的错误思想。经过学习和批判，同志们进一步认识到：四好连队运动，是毛主席的建军路线战胜资产阶级的反动军事路线的产物，是林副主席对毛主席建军路线的捍卫和发展，是在基层落实毛主席的建军路线和林副主席提出的一整套着重政治建军的方针原则，把我军办成毛泽东思想大学校的根本措施。按照什么路线建设我们的连队，这是两条军事路线斗争的焦点。开展四好连队运动，就是按照毛主席的建军路线建设部队，使我军永远沿着毛主席的革命路线胜利前进；反对和破坏四好连队运动，就是妄图把我们的连队建设引上资产阶级反动军事路线的邪路。
    在讨论中，同志们还回顾了我们中队在创造四好连队运动中成长的历史：
    一九六三年，有的人受到资产阶级反动军事路线的影响，在我们中队散布了“运输艇主要是搞运输，完不成运输任务，其它再好也白搭”的论调。我们通过四好检查，批驳了这种论调，指出这种论调实质上就是毛主席在古田会议决议里早已批驳了的“军事好，政治自然会好”的翻版。我们在工作中坚持把
  “政治思想好”摆在首要的位置，贯彻执行了毛主席“政治是统帅，是灵魂”的伟大教导。
    一九六四年，大比武的妖风刮到我们中队。我们在开展四好连队运动中，发动干部战士掀起活学活用毛主席著作的新高潮，规定了“天天读”制度“三不垮”：任务重压不垮，航程远拖不垮，台风大刮不垮，有力地抵制了这股妖风。
    一九六五年，罗瑞卿的“军事政治轮流突出”的反动谬论传到我们中队，个别同志也受了影响，认为：“我们中队突出政治有基础了，眼下新艇多，新干部多，得要先突击一下技术了。”我们就在不断进行四好动员时，反复检查和落实林副主席关于突出无产阶级政治的指示，对新艇新干部抓紧突出政治的教育，从而清除了折中主义的影响，保证了毛主席建军路线的贯彻执行。
    在无产阶级文化大革命中，阶级斗争和两条路线斗争的新形势，不仅没有丝毫降低开展创造四好连队运动的伟大意义，而且进一步证明了四好连队运动具有非常强大的生命力。无产阶级文化大革命给四好连队运动提出了更高的要求，更高的标准；阶级斗争和两条路线斗争的大风大浪，又为创造高水平的过硬的四好连队，开辟了广阔的天地。对四好连队运动的任何动摇都是非常错误的，都必须彻底批判。
    我们深深体会到：对待四好连队运动的态度，就是对待毛主席建军路线的态度。对四好连队运动的任何怀疑和动摇，就是对毛主席建军路线的怀疑和动摇。我们一定坚决贯彻毛主席的建军路线，随着阶级斗争形势的发展，不断地把我们的四好连队运动推向前进，不断地创造出更高水平的四好连队。
    建设无限忠于毛主席的战斗集体，
    是开展四好连队运动的根本目的
    开展四好连队运动的根本目的是什么？我们在无产阶级文化大革命的新形势下，在不断实践中进一步提高了认识和自觉。副艇长吴述林同志的先进事迹，给了我们很大启发。
    去年春天，吴述林同志的父亲病危，爱人也得了重病，组织上批准他回家照顾一下。他一到家乡，看到阶级敌人正在疯狂地破坏生产，大队的生产没人抓，许多要播种育秧的地一动没动。他想：个人的事再大也是小事，保卫毛主席的革命路线才是大事！于是，他毫不犹豫地把爱人和父亲交给妹妹照料，回家第二天，就跟贫下中农一起投入反击阶级敌人的破坏活动的战斗。他白天带头劳动，夜里挨家逐户进行调查访问，并且带着问题学习毛主席在无产阶级专政下继续革命的理论、路线、方针、方法和政策。他用毛主席的一系列的最新指示武装了思想，并且摸清了阶级斗争情况，就挺身而出，向社员和干部广泛宣传毛主席的最新指示，揭露阶级敌人疯狂推行资产阶级反动路线的滔天罪行。同时，对革命干部进行思想发动工作，帮助他们站起来领导生产。他回乡二十七天，就同广大贫下中农一起，艰苦战斗了二十三天。结果，阶级敌人受到沉重打击，革命干部挑起抓革命、促生产的重担，广大社员组织起来学习毛泽东思想，阶级觉悟迅速提高。大队的革命和生产的面貌发生了很大的变化。
    在尖锐复杂的阶级斗争和两条路线斗争中，吴述林为什么能发挥这样大的作用呢？最根本的原因，就是因为他有一颗对毛主席的无限忠心。这件事使我们深刻地认识到：在无产阶级文化大革命的新形势下，必须把开展四好连队运动的目的，自觉地提高到对毛主席、对毛泽东思想、对毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的根本态度上来。建设一个无限忠于毛主席、无限忠于毛泽东思想、无限忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的战斗集体，是我们开展四好连队运动的根本目的。于是，支部就作出决定，在全中队广泛开展学习吴述林、为忠于毛主席而创四好的宣传教育活动。
    开展四好连队运动的根本目的，并不是一下子就能为大家深刻地认识的。为忠于毛主席创四好，还是为评四好而创四好？在这个问题上，有些同志道理上明白，一碰到具体问题，就常常搞糊涂了。已经连续六年被评为四好艇的四七八艇，去年长期远离党支部领导，在一个偏僻小岛担任运输任务，工作繁重，生活异常艰苦。在这种条件下，有的同志就产生松劲的思想：生活这么苦，离中队又这么远，千辛万苦没人知道，四好难评上了，能对付过去就算啦！支部抓住这个问题，又一次向他们进行了为忠于毛主席而创四好的教育，要求同志们做到：身在小岛荒滩上，艇在草丛烂泥中，远离北京几千里，时刻想着毛主席！以后，四七八艇的同志们，利用一切时机进行了无限忠于毛主席的教育。在装卸石头的间隙时间，在航渡中停泊的几十分钟，他们也抓紧学习毛主席著作，召开“三忠于”讲用会。以忠于毛主席、忠于毛泽东思想、忠于毛主席革命路线为根本目的的四好连队运动，在四七八艇蓬蓬勃勃地开展起来。这时候，这艘艇上有一个战士怕苦嫌累，要求调到别的艇上去。是不是答应他调动工作的要求，免得影响评四好？支委会反复讨论了这个问题，坚定地认为，一个战士跟不上队，就要帮助他跟上队。一定要把全体同志，培养成为无限忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命战士。这正是开展四好连队运动的根本目的。支部决定：不但不能调动这个战士的工作，而且要通过对这个问题的正确处理，教育全艇同志坚持四好高标准，进一步树立为忠于毛主席而创四好的思想。于是，全艇同志齐心合力帮助这个战士，终于使这个战士迅速赶上了队。
    在以创造无限忠于毛主席的战斗集体为根本目的的四好连队运动中，四七八艇的同志们熔铸了一颗颗对毛主席的无限忠心。在尖锐复杂的阶级斗争和两条路线斗争中，他们坚定地站在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线上，向资产阶级的反动军事路线和建军思想作了顽强的斗争。他们终于以更高的标准，再一次跨入四好的行列。
    深入持久地开展革命大批判，是
    开展四好连队运动的强大动力
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们说：“我们现在思想战线上的一个重要任务，就是要开展对于修正主义的批判。”我们在执行毛主席的教导中，比较深刻地体会到：在新的形势下，深入持久地开展革命大批判，是开展四好连队运动的强大动力。
    无产阶级文化大革命以来，我们一直都在抓革命大批判。但是，由于我们对革命大批判要深入持久地进行认识不足，有一个时期，抓得不那么紧。正在这时候，发生了结成“一对红”的两个战士闹不团结的事。这“一对红”，一个是老战士，一个是新战士。他们本来关系很好，可是最近却由疏远而争吵起来。原来，那个新战士觉得自己的政治思想没问题，主要是缺技术；可那个老战士却坚持突出无产阶级政治，把政治摆在首位，主要地还是跟他谈政治，谈思想。这样，两人就合不来。党支部认为：这不是普通的争吵，而是两条建军路线的斗争在战士身上的反映。我们便召开支委会进行研究。会上，有的干部认为：新战士担心技术学不好完不成任务，是很自然的。运输部队，专门的政治教育时间和军事训练时间都很少，靠天天练那点时间，根本不能解决问题。真没有想到，从两个战士争吵这件事上，暴露出个别干部的一些活思想。原来，有的干部抓军训不主动，主要是认为时间少，解决不了问题。这实际上就是要求压缩政治教育时间来搞军训。归根到底，还是单纯军事观点在作怪。
    这个问题引起了我们很大震动。为什么反复批判过的、看来已经解决了的单纯军事技术观点，现在又会冒出来呢？支委会经过检查和讨论，深刻地认识到：要使毛主席的建军路线和建军思想，在每个同志的头脑里牢牢地扎下根子，彻底清除资产阶级的反动军事路线和军事思想的毒害和影响，并不是一下子能够做到的。在阶级斗争和两条路线斗争尖锐复杂的新形势下，提高两条路线斗争觉悟是长期的战斗任务。革命大批判不但一时一刻不能放松，而且要持久开展，步步深入。不然，在创造四好连队运动中，就不可能做到“政治思想好”，也不可能做到“一好带三好”。
    在支委扩大会上，我们发动干部认真学习了毛主席的有关教导，讨论在新形势下深入持久地开展革命大批判的重要意义。中队长刘本生讲了这几年同自己头脑里的单纯军事技术观点作斗争的曲折、反复的过程。他曾经在海军进行四个第一教育的时候，大大克服了单纯军事技术观点，但是，在反革命修正主义分子罗瑞卿刮起大比武妖风的时候，他的单纯军事技术观点又冒了出来。在毛主席指示“要随时参加批判资产阶级的文化革命斗争”以前和以后，有两段时间，同样是中队指导员外出了，艇的干部比较新，出海任务又特别繁重，他的工作状况却截然不同。在毛主席指示下达以前，我们中队没有开展革命大批判，他解决干部新、任务重的办法，就是每艘艇出海都紧紧跟着，实行“技术保驾”，结果新干部不能迅速成长，怕出问题偏偏出问题。在执行了毛主席的指示，开展了革命大批判以后，他面对着干部新、任务重的困难，狠抓新干部活学活用“老三篇”，实行“政治保驾”，结果新干部迅速成长，任务也完成得很好。刘本生深有体会地说：中国赫鲁晓夫和反革命修正主义分子彭德怀、罗瑞卿，多少年来推行了一套反革命修正主义路线和资产阶级反动军事路线，他们的影响是很深的。革命大批判松一松，资产阶级思想就会攻一攻。什么时候不狠抓革命大批判，资产阶级思想就会扩大它的阵地。
    一个轰轰烈烈又扎扎实实的革命大批判热潮，在我们中队持久地开展起来，部队的阶级觉悟和两条路线斗争觉悟迅速提高。那些原先不突出政治的干部，在革命大批判中，都联系自己的思想实际，深刻地检查了思想深处的军事技术第一的思想。通过持久地开展革命大批判，进一步促进了部队的思想革命化，一好带动了三好，中队的四好连队运动不断地向前发展。
    全面落实毛主席的最新指示，是
    进一步开展四好连队运动的关键
    紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，全面落实毛主席的最新指示，不断地用毛主席关于在无产阶级专政下继续进行革命的理论、路线、方针、方法和政策武装干部和战士，这是在无产阶级文化大革命新形势下，创出四好新水平的具有决定意义的问题。对于这个问题，我们也是在不断实践中认识和体会到的。
    去年，当伟大领袖毛主席发出“要拥军爱民”的伟大号召以后，我们中队出现了两种完全不同的情况。有两艘艇的干部认为：拥军爱民是我党我军几十年的光荣传统，每年春节都要进行拥军爱民教育，部队对这个问题的认识已经比较深刻。在这种思想指导下，对毛主席这条最新指示，就没有深入地组织学习。结果，这两条艇在远离中队执行运输任务的过程中，虽然整天和人民群众在一起，在搞好军民关系上却没有做出什么新的成绩。
    大多数艇的情况与此相反。他们经过反复学习，对毛主席“要拥军爱民”的指示有了新的认识。他们体会到：在无产阶级文化大革命取得决定性胜利的关键时刻，毛主席发出“要拥军爱民”的伟大号召，具有极其重要的意义。贯彻执行毛主席的这一最新指示，对于夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利，将起着决定性的作用。认识上有了新的飞跃，行动上就出现了新的局面。用毛泽东思想武装群众就是最大的爱民。干部战士通过各种渠道，利用各种机会，向人民群众宣传毛泽东思想。他们赶排节目，常常到了一个地方，就上码头，进渔村，向人民群众宣传演出；他们开展了一封信活动，向亲友广泛宣传毛主席的最新指示。干部战士外出、探家、住院，艇上交代他们的第一件任务，就是向群众宣传毛泽东思想。毛主席的最新指示深入人心，不但提高了群众觉悟，推动了工作，而且进一步密切了军民关系，把部队的四好运动大大向前推进了一步。
    通过这件事，党支部又进一步学习了毛主席的一系列最新指示，讨论了毛主席发出每一条指示的伟大意义，大家深刻地认识到：毛主席的每一条最新指示，都是无产阶级文化大革命运动中的战略措施，都体现了毛主席关于无产阶级专政下进行革命的理论、路线、方针、方法和政策。只有全面落实了毛主席的最新指示，我们才能沿着毛主席指引的航道前进，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利！“政治是统帅，是灵魂”，认真落实毛主席的每一条最新指示，就是最大的政治。实现“政治思想好”，最根本最核心的问题，就是紧跟毛主席的战略部署，全面落实毛主席的最新指示。离开了毛主席的最新指示去创四好，必然要走到邪路上去。
    我们中队有个艇长，在探家期间，发现妹妹被阶级敌人蒙蔽，站错了队，他就以毛主席的最新指示为武器，帮助她提高两条路线斗争觉悟。经过艰苦细致的思想工作，终于使她提高了觉悟，向阶级敌人反戈一击。在短短的探家一个月中，他就帮助了十多个受蒙蔽的群众，回到毛主席的革命路线上来。中队党支部以他的模范事迹作为样板，号召同志们认真学习和落实毛主席的最新指示：“你们要关心国家大事，要把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！”经过学习这位艇长的先进事迹活动，同志们学习和执行毛主席最新指示的自觉性大大提高，把紧跟毛主席的每一条最新指示，看作是无限忠于毛主席革命路线的重要标志。毛主席的最新指示一发表，大家立即抓紧学习、领会，认真宣传和贯彻执行。有个战士学习了“办学习班，是个好办法，很多问题可以在学习班得到解决”的最新指示，先后三次写信给家乡生产大队，寄去这条最新指示和一部分毛主席著作，希望他们立即把大队的毛泽东思想学习班办起来；服役期满的老战士，个个决心走上农村阶级斗争的第一线，在无产阶级文化大革命中为人民立新功。
    我们深切地体会到：我们中队的干部战士，虽然没有直接担负“三支”“两军”的任务，但是，由于我们在开展四好连队运动中，能够注意紧跟毛主席的最新指示，主动地、积极地投入到两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争中，接受教育和锻炼，无产阶级觉悟和两条路线斗争觉悟有了很大提高，政治思想水平有了很大提高。很多同志深有体会地说：全面落实毛主席最新指示，是我们进一步开展四好连队运动的关键。我们一定要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，全面落实毛主席的每一条最新指示，为创造出更高水平的四好连队而继续努力！
