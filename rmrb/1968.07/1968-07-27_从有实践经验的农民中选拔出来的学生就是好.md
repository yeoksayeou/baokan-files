Our most beloved and great leader Chairman Mao recently pointed out profoundly: "Universities must still be run. I am mainly talking about universities of science and engineering, which must still be run, but the school system should be shortened, education should be revolutionized, and proletarian politics should take command, following the path of Shanghai Machine Tool Factory in training technical personnel from among workers. Students should be selected from among workers and peasants with practical experience, and after studying for a few years in school, they should return to production practice."

Chairman Mao's great call is the greatest encouragement, the greatest support, and the greatest spur for us. It is our battle program to carry the proletarian educational revolution through to the end, a hundred-year plan to prevent revisionism, and the fundamental path to train successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause.

Our Gaitoupu Normal School is one of the key schools in Hebei Province for training teachers for rural areas. It has always been an important battlefield where the two classes, two roads, and two lines fiercely struggle. Under the control of the former provincial and municipal committees and a small clique of capitalist roaders within the school, traitors, spies, and other counter-revolutionaries were gathered, controlling the school's party, government, financial, and cultural powers. They vigorously promoted the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line of "intellectual education first" and "grades first" advocated by the Chinese Khrushchev, making education divorced from proletarian politics, from reality, and from the masses, and turning students into weak scholars who only know "the higher the education, the better" and do not know that labor is the most glorious.

In 1964 and 1965, at the strong request of the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary teachers and students, our school successively enrolled three classes of students who had returned to the countryside to work after graduating from junior high school. They were selected by the local poor and lower-middle peasants. These students from the production front generally have practical experience in class struggle and production struggle.

The emergence of everything new will inevitably be destroyed and attacked by class enemies and conservative forces. During the enrollment, a small clique of capitalist roaders within the party said: "It is better to enroll ten poor graduates than to enroll one returning peasant." After the three classes of students entered the school, they were even more persecuted by the capitalist roaders and class enemies. These people sneered at them, looked down on them, and said that these socially conscious young peasants from the countryside were "rustic" and "inferior goods," while those enrolled according to the revisionist line were regarded as the "regular army." The old gentlemen of the bourgeois intellectuals said: "Even with the effort of nine cows and two tigers, good teachers cannot be trained, and in the end, they will still go home to be farmers."

Great Leader Chairman Mao supports the poor and lower-middle peasants, and the children of the poor and lower-middle peasants make Chairman Mao proud. These peasant students have only one heart: to read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, and be good soldiers of Chairman Mao; they have only one wish: to take the countryside as their battlefield, and to rush to where Chairman Mao points.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The most intelligent and most talented are the soldiers with the most practical experience." Successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause must be tempered and grown in the great winds and waves of class struggle. Over the years, we have deeply felt that the only correct condition and standard for training primary school teachers for rural areas is to select students from among peasants with practical experience. Such students are good.

Peasant youth with practical experience who become students are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, infinitely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. What they love most is the great leader Chairman Mao and the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. What they hate most is the evil old society and the Chinese Khrushchev. More than 90% of the students in our three classes come from poor and lower-middle peasant families. Each family has a "bitter account," and each generation has a blood debt. After entering the school, they put the study and application of Mao Zedong Thought in the first place. Whenever Chairman Mao's latest instructions are issued, they immediately go deep into urban streets and rural production brigades to propagate them. In the struggle against the enemy, they dare to launch a fierce attack on the revisionist educational line and a small clique of class enemies, and together with revolutionary teachers and students, they severely criticized the revisionist educational line and exposed hidden traitors, spies, and other counter-revolutionaries.

Peasant youth with practical experience who become students love the poor and lower-middle peasants the most. They maintain the fine tradition of hard work and simplicity, have the deepest class feelings with the poor and lower-middle peasants, and share the same language. They think what the poor and lower-middle peasants think, worry about what the poor and lower-middle peasants worry about, and help with what the poor and lower-middle peasants need. Once, a female student went to Sunan County's Duanjiazhuang Brigade to propagate Mao Zedong Thought and saw that a peasant child, Zhang Lianrui, who had lost his parents, had no shoes to wear. She made shoes for the child while working. In this brigade, she made one pair, and after going to another brigade, she made a second pair and sent it to little Lianrui. The villagers of Duanjiazhuang Brigade praised her as a "good daughter of the poor and lower-middle peasants."

Peasant youth with practical experience who become students love labor the most. They regard participating in productive labor as an important course for transforming their subjective world and not alienating from the masses. Every time they go to the countryside to work, they are not afraid of dirt and not afraid of hard work, going to where it is most difficult. They are proficient in everything and just like the villagers. They do everything, from shoveling manure, turning the circle, driving the cart, and delivering fertilizer. During this year's drought relief, a few students saw that the seedlings in the fourth brigade of Gaitoupu Town were very dry, and they were very anxious. There was no time during the day, so what should they do? Nine of them went to water the fields at night. The next morning, the villagers of the fourth brigade were very moved and excitedly said: "You are indeed good students educated by Chairman Mao, and good descendants of us poor and lower-middle peasants."

Through several years of practice, we have deeply realized that Chairman Mao's latest instructions, "to select students from among workers and peasants with practical experience, and after studying for a few years in school, they should return to production practice," are absolutely correct and brilliant. The path taken by the Shanghai Machine Tool Factory is the path we should take. Currently, our school is conducting the distribution of graduates. After two years of tempering in the proletarian cultural revolution, these students from agricultural production positions have greatly heightened their awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines. Many people have expressed their willingness to obediently accept the party and the state's distribution, resolutely respond to Chairman Mao's great call, go to the countryside, go to the border, go to the mines, go to the grassroots, go to where the motherland needs them the most, and walk the path of integrating with workers, peasants, and soldiers for life, forever being good descendants of the poor and lower-middle peasants.

    从有实践经验的农民中选拔出来的学生就是好
    河北省柴沟堡师范学校革委会、驻校解放军毛泽东思想宣传队
    我们最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席最近深刻地指出：“大学还是要办的，我这里主要说的是理工科大学还要办，但学制要缩短，教育要革命，要无产阶级政治挂帅，走上海机床厂从工人中培养技术人员的道路。要从有实践经验的工人农民中间选拔学生，到学校学几年以后，又回到生产实践中去。”毛主席的伟大号召，是对我们的最大鼓舞，最大支持，最大鞭策，是我们将无产阶级教育革命进行到底的战斗纲领，是反修防修的百年大计，是培养无产阶级革命事业接班人的根本道路。
    我们柴沟堡师范学校，是河北省为农村培养教师队伍的重点学校之一。这里一直是两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线激烈搏斗的一个重要阵地。在旧省、地委以及校内一小撮走资派的把持下，网罗叛徒、特务和其他反革命分子，控制了学校的党、政、财、文大权，极力推行中国赫鲁晓夫“智育第一”、“分数第一”的反革命修正主义教育路线，使教育脱离无产阶级政治，脱离实际，脱离群众，把学生培养成了只知道“唯有读书高”，不知道劳动最光荣的文弱书生。
    一九六四年和一九六五年，在广大贫下中农和革命师生的强烈要求下，我们学校先后招收了三个班，都是初中毕业后回乡参加劳动的学生。他们是经当地贫下中农评选出来的。这些从生产第一线来的学生，一般地都具有阶级斗争和生产斗争的实践经验。
    一切新生事物的出现，都要遭到阶级敌人和保守势力的破坏和攻击。在招生的时候，党内一小撮走资派就说：“宁可招十个差的应届毕业生，也不招一个还乡生产的老农民”。三个班的学生入校后，更是受到了走资派和阶级敌人的迫害。这些家伙对他们冷嘲热讽，另眼相看，说这些来自农村的有社会主义觉悟的青年农民“土里土气”，是“等外品”，而把按照修正主义那一套吸收的学生看成是“正规军”。资产阶级知识分子老爷们说：“费九牛二虎之力，也培养不出个好教师来，到头来还是回家去当农民。”
    伟大领袖毛主席给贫下中农撑腰，贫下中农的子弟为毛主席争气。这些农民学生，只有一个心眼：读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，做毛主席的好战士；只有一个志愿，把农村作为自己的战斗岗位，毛主席指向哪里就奔向哪里。
    毛主席教导我们：“最聪明、最有才能的，是最有实践经验的战士。”无产阶级革命事业接班人，就是要在阶级斗争的大风大浪中锻炼成长。几年来，我们深刻地体会到，为农村培养小学教师，选拔学生的唯一正确的条件和标准，就是有实践经验的农民，这样的学生就是好。
    有实践经验的青年农民当了学生，他们无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于毛泽东思想，无限忠于毛主席的革命路线。他们最热爱的是伟大领袖毛主席和战无不胜的毛泽东思想，他们最痛恨的是万恶的旧社会和中国赫鲁晓夫。我们这三个班的学生，有百分之九十以上是出身于贫下中农家庭。他们家家都有一本“苦情账”，祖辈都有一笔血泪仇。他们入校以后，就把活学活用毛泽东思想摆在首位。每当毛主席的最新指示一发表，他们就立即深入城镇街头和农村生产大队进行宣传。在对敌斗争中，他们敢于向修正主义教育路线和一小撮阶级敌人猛烈进攻，和革命师生一起，狠批了修正主义教育路线，挖出了暗藏的叛徒、特务和其他反革命分子。
    有实践经验的青年农民当了学生，最热爱贫下中农。他们保持艰苦朴素的优良作风，和贫下中农的阶级感情最深，有共同的语言。他们想贫下中农所想，急贫下中农所急，帮贫下中农所需。有一次，一位女同学到阳泉县段家庄大队去宣传毛泽东思想，见一个失去父母的贫农子弟张连瑞没有鞋子穿，她就边劳动边给孩子做鞋。在这个大队时做成了一双，到别的大队之后，又做了第二双给小连瑞寄去。段家庄大队的社员们夸她是“贫下中农的好闺女”。
    有实践经验的青年农民当了学生，最热爱劳动。他们把参加生产劳动当作改造主观世界、不脱离群众的重要课程。每次下乡劳动，他们都是不怕脏，不怕累，那里艰苦就到那里去。干起活来样样内行，和社员们一模一样。倒粪、翻圈、赶车、送肥，样样都干。在今年抗旱的时候，有几个学生看到柴沟堡镇第四大队的小苗旱得很厉害，心里很着急。白天又没有时间，怎么办呢？九个人就在夜间引水浇地。第二天早晨，四大队的社员们见了很受感动，激动地说：“你们真是毛主席教育出来的好学生，是咱贫下中农的好后代。”
    通过几年来的实践，使我们深刻地认识到，毛主席的最新指示“要从有实践经验的工人农民中间选拔学生，到学校学几年以后，又回到生产实践中去。”无比正确，无比英明。上海机床厂所走过的路，就是我们要走的道路。目前，我校正在进行毕业生的分配工作。经过两年来无产阶级文化大革命的锻炼，这些从农业生产岗位上来的学生，阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟空前提高。许多人都纷纷表示要愉快地服从党和国家的分配，坚决响应毛主席的伟大号召，到农村去，到边疆去，到工矿去，到基层去，到祖国最需要的地方去，一辈子走同工农兵相结合的道路，永做贫下中农的好后代。
