	The Chinese People's Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries and the China-Japan Friendship Association sent a telegram to the Japan-China Friendship Association (Orthodox) Headquarters on July 16, expressing warm congratulations on the 17th National Congress of the Japan-China Friendship Association (Orthodox) Headquarters to be held on July 19. The telegram also congratulated the Japanese people on their great victories in their struggles against U.S. imperialism's aggression in Vietnam, against U.S. military bases, in smashing the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," and in opposing the anti-China crimes of the Soviet revisionists and Japanese revisionists.

	The telegram pointed out that these victories of the Japanese people have dealt heavy blows to U.S. imperialism and its running dogs, and have been a great support and encouragement to the Chinese people and revolutionary people around the world.

	The telegram said that at present, the world revolution has entered a great new era. The unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China is achieving all-round victory. The heroic Vietnamese people have won brilliant victories in their war of resistance against U.S. aggression for national salvation. The national democratic revolutionary struggles in Asia, Africa, and Latin America are surging forward. The stormy revolutionary mass movements in Europe and North America are shaking the entire capitalist system. The days of imperialism, revisionism, and reaction are getting worse. The international situation is very favorable to the revolutionary people of all countries.

	The telegram emphasized that in this favorable situation, the enemy will not readily accept their failure. The U.S.-Japanese reactionaries are actively plotting to "maintain" the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," frantically reviving Japanese militarism, and attempting to bind the Japanese people to the U.S. war chariot, making Japan a base for U.S. imperialism's aggression against China and Asia. The Soviet revisionist clique and the Japanese revisionist clique of Komoto are serving the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries, fiercely attacking China. However, any desperate struggles of the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries and a handful of traitors of the people will not save them from their inevitable doom.

	The telegram finally expressed that the Chinese people, armed with Mao Zedong Thought and tempered by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, are determined to stand together with the fighting Japanese people. They will unite all possible forces, form the broadest united front against U.S. imperialism and its running dogs, smash the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," smash U.S. imperialism's policy of aggression and war, defeat U.S. imperialism and its running dogs, and struggle for the defense of peace in Asia and the world.

	The Chinese Committee for Afro-Asian Solidarity, the Chinese People's Association for Peace and Disarmament, the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs, the Chinese Red Cross Society, and the Chinese People's Relief Association also sent telegrams or letters, expressing warm congratulations on the convening of the 17th National Congress of the Japan-China Friendship Association (Orthodox) Headquarters.

    中日友协和对外友协电贺日中友协（正统）总部全国大会
    日本人民的英勇斗争给世界人民巨大支持
    中国人民决心同日本人民团结战斗打败美帝及其帮凶
    新华社十九日讯　中国日本友好协会和中国人民对外文化友好协会十六日打电报给日本中国友好协会（正统）总部，对日中友协（正统）总部将于七月十九日举行的第十七次全国大会表示热烈祝贺，并且祝日本人民在反对美帝国主义侵略越南、反对美国军事基地、粉碎日美“安全条约”以及反对苏修和日修反华罪行的斗争中所取得的巨大胜利。
    贺电指出，日本人民所取得的这些胜利，给美帝国主义及其帮凶们以沉重的打击，对中国人民和世界革命人民都是巨大的支持和鼓舞。
    贺电说，当前，世界革命进入了一个伟大的新时代。史无前例的中国无产阶级文化大革命，正在夺取全面胜利。英勇的越南人民取得了抗美救国战争的辉煌胜利。亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲的民族民主革命斗争，蓬勃高涨。欧洲和北美的革命群众运动的大风暴，猛烈地冲击着整个资本主义制度。帝、修、反的日子越来越不好过。国际形势十分有利于世界各国的革命人民。
    贺电强调说，在大好形势下，敌人是不甘心于他们的失败的。美日反动派正在积极策划“保持”日美“安全条约”的阴谋，疯狂复活日本军国主义，妄图把日本人民绑在美国的战车上，把日本作为美帝国主义侵略中国和亚洲的基地；苏修叛徒集团和宫本修正主义集团正在为美日反动派效劳，大肆反华。但是，美日反动派和一小撮人民的叛徒的任何垂死挣扎，也挽救不了他们必然灭亡的命运。
    贺电最后表示，用毛泽东思想武装起来的、经过无产阶级文化大革命锻炼的中国人民，决心同战斗的日本人民一道，团结一切可以团结的力量，结成反对美帝国主义及其帮凶们的最广泛的统一战线，粉碎日美“安全条约”，粉碎美帝国主义的侵略政策和战争政策，打败美帝国主义及其帮凶们，为保卫亚洲和世界和平而奋斗。
    中国亚非团结委员会、中国人民保卫世界和平委员会、中国国际贸易促进委员会、中国人民外交学会、中国红十字会和中国人民救济总会等团体，也分别打电报或写信，热烈祝贺日中友协（正统）总部第十七次全国大会的召开。
