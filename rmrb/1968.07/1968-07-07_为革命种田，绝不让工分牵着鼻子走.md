Everyone is eager to do things for the public, and no one touches things for private gain
— Members and cadres of Hongshimen Brigade in Pinggu County fiercely criticize the fallacies of “work points in command” propagated by the Chinese Khrushchev

Cultivating for the Revolution, Never Letting Work Points Lead Us by the Nose

Old brigade leader Guo Yongli: The Chinese Khrushchev is a wolf in sheep's clothing. He puts on a fake smile and says, “Reward those who work hard and honestly.” This is using the bourgeoisie’s “private” to confuse our minds. This is a sugar-coated bullet aimed at us, the poor and lower-middle peasants. The Chinese Khrushchev wants to use small benefits to deceive us, to restore capitalism, and make us return to the old society filled with suffering. This is sheer delusion!

The cadres and masses of our Hongshimen Brigade, through the Four Clean-ups Movement and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and through the arduous struggle to transform nature, have studied and applied Chairman Mao Zedong’s Thought extensively. We have used the brilliant ideas of the “Three Constantly Read Articles” as our weapon to launch a fierce attack on the bourgeoisie’s “private” and have firmly established the proletarian “public.” We, the poor and lower-middle peasants, say: “Chairman Mao Zedong’s Thought is in our hearts; we, the poor and lower-middle peasants, think of the collective; we do not touch things for private gain, and we set an example for things for the public.”

Chairman Mao Zedong’s Thought shines brightly, illuminating our hearts. We, the poor and lower-middle peasants of Hongshimen, do not seek fame or wealth; we only want communism. The Chinese Khrushchev advocates material incentives and promotes “work points in command,” making us revolve around work points all day. This is to let us take advantage of the collective, undermine the foundations of socialism, make us only see the small world under our noses, abandon the proletarian “public,” abandon our loyalty to Chairman Mao Zedong’s Thought, and abandon the path of socialism. In the end, it is to make us abandon the red socialist mountains and rivers. The poor and lower-middle peasants armed with Chairman Mao Zedong’s Thought will never fall for your tricks! We will have the whole of China in our hearts and look at the whole world. With our communist revolutionary actions of wholeheartedly serving the public and everything for the public, we will smash the Chinese Khrushchev’s evil plot to restore capitalism and let the invincible Chairman Mao Zedong’s Thought forever illuminate our path forward!

Member Chen Xiuying: The Chinese Khrushchev fiercely opposes Chairman Mao’s revolutionary line, advocates material incentives, and promotes “work points in command,” falsely claiming that material incentives “benefit production and conform to the principle of remuneration according to labor.” This is all nonsense.

Material incentives and “work points in command” are what? They are soft knives that kill without bloodshed, poisonous drugs coated in sugar. When the sky changes, people change first; when people change, their hearts change first. The Chinese Khrushchev wants to use material incentives to make us only care about personal material enjoyment, forget class struggle, forget proletarian dictatorship, forget the fundamental interests of the proletariat, drag us back to the old society where people eat people, make us suffer twice and endure hardships twice. This is absolutely impossible, a thousand times impossible, a million times impossible!

During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we, the poor and lower-middle peasants of Hongshimen, responded to Chairman Mao’s great call to “criticize revisionism and repudiate self,” studied and applied the “Three Constantly Read Articles” extensively, and fiercely criticized the Chinese Khrushchev’s counterrevolutionary revisionist line. The poor and lower-middle peasants all say: “We will cultivate for the revolution, not for work points.”

“Work points in command” is the bourgeoisie’s individualism in command. We must hold high the great red banner of Chairman Mao Zedong’s Thought, continue to carry out thorough and prolonged revolutionary criticism, and eliminate the poison of the Chinese Khrushchev’s revisionism, letting Chairman Mao Zedong’s Thought occupy all positions.

Old shepherd Chen Fucheng: The Chinese Khrushchev advocates material incentives and “work points in command,” which is extremely evil. Once work points are in command, “private” will rise. “Public” and “private” are like fire and water, incompatible. The more “private” there is, the less “public” there is. The less “private” there is, the more “public” there is. The Chinese Khrushchev wants to use “work points in command” to fill our minds with “private,” squeeze out “public,” squeeze out the collective, and squeeze out the red socialist mountains and rivers. The Chinese Khrushchev is indeed a cunning and treacherous enemy. We must resolutely criticize and expose him, making him never able to rise again.

Women’s director Chen Shufen: The Chinese Khrushchev advocates “work points in command,” which is to encourage selfishness and self-interest, to drag us onto the capitalist evil path. Working for work points, only caring about personal gain and personal wealth, will ultimately lead to great losses and being deceived by the Chinese Khrushchev onto the old capitalist road. “Private” is the root of all evil. We must fiercely criticize the Chinese Khrushchev’s spread of revisionist black goods, thoroughly eliminate its poison, and criticize revisionism and repudiate self, doing a good job in the revolutionization of thought.

Member Zhang Yongshan: The Chinese Khrushchev falsely claims that giving more work points and more money will make the masses “work hard.” This is a great insult to our broad masses of members. We, the poor and lower-middle peasants of Hongshimen, stand on the Great Wall, see the whole of China, have the whole world in our hearts, rely on our own efforts, strive hard, break private interests and establish public interests, transform nature, and do all this for the complete victory of the revolution, for the complete liberation of mankind. Who cares about your stinking money!

Chairman Mao Zedong’s Thought is a powerful ideological weapon to defeat revisionism and capitalism, a powerful ideological weapon to transform people’s souls. Once Chairman Mao Zedong’s Thought is grasped by the masses, it will become an infinite force to transform society and the world. “Work points in command” can only encourage the bourgeoisie’s “private” enthusiasm and capitalist enthusiasm. With the bourgeoisie’s “private” enthusiasm, there is absolutely no proletarian “public” enthusiasm. With capitalist enthusiasm, there is absolutely no socialist enthusiasm. The higher this enthusiasm, the greater the harm it does to the proletariat and to socialism. We must hold high the great red banner of Chairman Mao Zedong’s Thought, always put proletarian politics in command, and throw the Chinese Khrushchev’s material incentives and “work points in command” into the dung heap!

Accountant Wang Yulin: The Chinese Khrushchev and his agents frantically spread the fallacies of material incentives and “work points in command,” which is to harm us, the poor and lower-middle peasants, and try to drag us into the capitalist mire. We will never agree to this. Work points are absolutely not our lifeline; only the great Chairman Mao Zedong’s Thought is our lifeline. We cultivate for the revolution and will never let work points lead us by the nose. We must study and apply Chairman Mao’s works extensively, eliminate the poison of the Chinese Khrushchev’s “work points in command,” criticize revisionism and repudiate self, and become new people of communism.

### 为革命种田，绝不让工分牵着鼻子走

    为公的事个个争先　为私的事决不沾边
    ——平谷县红石门大队社员和干部狠批中国赫鲁晓夫“工分挂帅”的谬论
    为革命种田，绝不让工分牵着鼻子走
    老队长郭永利：中国赫鲁晓夫是个笑面狼。他装出一副笑脸假惺惺地说：社员“老老实实劳动的好好奖励他一下”。这是用资产阶级的“私”字来迷住我们的心窍，这是向我们贫下中农打过来的糖衣炮弹。中国赫鲁晓夫妄图用点小便宜坑骗我们，好让他复辟资本主义，使我们退回到万恶的旧社会，吃大苦，受大罪，这完全是痴心妄想！
    我们红石门大队的干部和群众，在四清运动和无产阶级文化大革命运动中，在改天换地的艰苦奋战中，大学大用毛泽东思想，以“老三篇”的光辉思想为武器，向资产阶级“私”字发起了猛攻，把无产阶级“公”字立得牢牢的。我们贫下中农说：“毛泽东思想往咱心里装，咱贫下中农的心往集体上想；为私的事咱不沾边，为公的事咱要做榜样。”
    毛泽东思想闪金光，照得咱贫下中农心坎亮堂堂。我们红石门的贫下中农，不为名，不为利，一心只要共产主义。中国赫鲁晓夫鼓吹物质刺激，大搞工分挂帅，叫我们整天围着工分转，这是叫我们去占集体的便宜，挖社会主义的墙脚，叫我们只看到鼻子尖下的小天地，丢掉无产阶级的“公”，丢掉对毛泽东思想的“忠”，丢掉社会主义的“路”，九九归一，是要我们丢掉社会主义的红色江山。用毛泽东思想武装起来的贫下中农，决不上你们这一伙坏人的当！我们要胸怀全中国，放眼全世界，用一心为公、一切为公的共产主义革命行动，粉碎中国赫鲁晓夫复辟资本主义的罪恶阴谋，让战无不胜的毛泽东思想永远照耀着我们前进的道路！
    社员訾秀英：中国赫鲁晓夫疯狂地反对毛主席的革命路线，鼓吹物质刺激，大搞工分挂帅，胡说什么物质刺激“有利于生产，符合按劳取酬的原则”。这完全是瞎说八道。
    物质刺激，工分挂帅，是什么货色？它是杀人不见血的软刀子，是裹着糖衣的烈性毒药。变天先变人，变人先变心。中国赫鲁晓夫妄想通过物质刺激，要我们只关心个人的物质享受，忘记阶级斗争，忘记无产阶级专政，忘记无产阶级的根本利益，把我们拉回人吃人的旧社会，让我们吃二遍苦，受二茬罪，这一千个办不到，一万个办不到！
    在无产阶级文化大革命运动中，我们红石门的贫下中农，响应毛主席“要斗私，批修”的伟大号召，大学大用“老三篇”，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫这一套反革命修正主义路线。贫下中农都说：“我们要为革命种田，不为工分。”
    工分挂帅，就是资产阶级个人主义挂帅。我们要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，继续深入持久地开展革命的大批判，肃清中国赫鲁晓夫的修正主义流毒，让毛泽东思想占领一切阵地。
    老羊倌訾福臣：中国赫鲁晓夫鼓吹物质刺激，工分挂帅，真是坏极了。工分当了道，“私”字就抬头。公和私是水火不相容的。“私”字多一分，“公”字就少一分。“私”字少一分，“公”字就多一分。中国赫鲁晓夫就是想用工分挂帅，使我们头脑里充满“私”字，挤掉“公”字，挤掉集体，挤掉社会主义的红色江山。中国赫鲁晓夫实在是个阴险狡猾的敌人，我们要坚决把他批倒批臭，叫他永世不得翻身。
    妇女主任訾淑芬：中国赫鲁晓夫鼓吹工分挂帅，就是鼓励自私自利，就是要把我们拉向资本主义邪路。为工分干活，只顾自己得利，自己发财，终究要吃大亏，上大当，要被中国赫鲁晓夫坑骗到资本主义老路上去。“私”字是万恶之源，我们要狠狠批判中国赫鲁晓夫散布的修正主义黑货，彻底肃清其流毒，我们要斗私批修，搞好思想革命化。
    社员张永山：中国赫鲁晓夫胡说什么多给点工分，多给点钱，社员才会“好好生产”，这是对我们广大社员的莫大的侮辱。我们红石门的贫下中农站在长城岭，眼看全中国，胸怀全世界，自力更生，艰苦奋斗，破私立公，改天换地，为的是革命彻底胜利，为的是人类完全解放，谁想着你那几个臭钱！
    毛泽东思想是战胜修正主义和资本主义的强大思想武器，是改造人们灵魂的强大思想武器。毛泽东思想一旦被群众所掌握，就会变成改造社会、改造世界的无穷力量。工分挂帅，只能鼓励资产阶级“私”字的积极性，鼓励资本主义的积极性。有了资产阶级“私”字的积极性，绝没有无产阶级“公”字的积极性。有了资本主义的积极性，绝没有社会主义的积极性。这种积极性越高，对无产阶级、对社会主义的害处就越大。我们一定要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，永远突出无产阶级政治，把中国赫鲁晓夫的物质刺激、工分挂帅扔进粪坑里面去！
    会计王玉林：中国赫鲁晓夫和他的代理人拚命散布物质刺激、工分挂帅的谬论，这是在坑害我们贫下中农，妄想把我们贫下中农拉到资本主义的泥坑，我们坚决不答应。工分绝不是我们的命根子，只有伟大的毛泽东思想才是我们的命根子。我们为革命种田，绝不让工分牵着鼻子走。我们一定要大学大用毛主席著作，肃清中国赫鲁晓夫工分挂帅的流毒，斗私批修，做共产主义的新人。
