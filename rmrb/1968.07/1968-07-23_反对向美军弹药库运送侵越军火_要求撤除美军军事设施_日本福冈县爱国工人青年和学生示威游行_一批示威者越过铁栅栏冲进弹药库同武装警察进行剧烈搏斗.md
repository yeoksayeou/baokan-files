The People's Daily reports that according to the Oriental News Agency, approximately 2,000 patriotic workers, youth, and students from Fukuoka Prefecture held a demonstration march in Kitakyushu City on July 21. They protested against the transportation of U.S. war supplies to the U.S. Air Force's Yamada Ammunition Depot and strongly demanded the removal of U.S. military facilities in Japan.

This anti-U.S. struggle forced the U.S. imperialist war supplies, which were being transported by train from the U.S. base in Kure City, Hiroshima Prefecture to the Yamada Ammunition Depot, to stop.

On the morning of July 21, patriotic workers, youth, and students gathered in the central park near the Yamada Ammunition Depot. The meeting strongly condemned the Sato reactionary government's collusion with U.S. imperialism and its role as an accomplice in the U.S. imperialist war against Vietnam.

A representative speaking at the meeting severely refuted the parliamentary illusions and slander against Japanese patriotic students propagated by the revisionist group led by Miyamoto of the Japan Communist Party. He said, "The Japanese people cannot limit their activities within the scope allowed by the enemy. Only by bravely fighting and persevering can we achieve victory."

After the meeting, the participants, holding high red flags, marched towards the U.S. military Yamada Ammunition Depot with high spirits. Slogans such as "Smash the U.S.-Japan 'Security Treaty,'" "Remove the Yamada Ammunition Depot," "Oppose U.S. aggression in Vietnam," and "Overthrow the Sato reactionary government" echoed through the air.

The U.S. military authorities were terrified by the resolute struggle of the brave Japanese people. The Sato reactionary government, acting as the U.S. imperialists' watchdog, quickly dispatched armed police to brutally suppress the patriotic workers, youth, and students. However, the police's fascist suppression only ignited the righteous indignation of the patriotic masses. A group of demonstrators rushed to the gates of the ammunition depot, climbed over the nearly 2.5-meter-high iron fence, and engaged in fierce struggles with the armed police.

Another group of demonstrators threw stones fiercely at the police, destroying the inspection post at the gate. The brave actions of the demonstrators received enthusiastic support from patriotic citizens.

The Sato government attempted to stop the activities of the patriotic masses through suppression, but the demonstrators, undeterred by the reactionaries' savage suppression, continued to march from the Yamada Ammunition Depot to the Kita-Kyushu Station, causing traffic to be paralyzed for one and a half hours.

In the morning of July 21, in response to the anti-U.S. demonstrations by the people of Fukuoka Prefecture around the Yamada Ammunition Depot, patriotic students in Hiroshima Prefecture also held a grand demonstration at the Kure Station, blocking the train loaded with U.S. military ammunition from departing from the Kure Station in Hiroshima Prefecture to the Yamada Ammunition Depot.

    反对向美军弹药库运送侵越军火　要求撤除美军军事设施
    日本福冈县爱国工人青年和学生示威游行
    一批示威者越过铁栅栏冲进弹药库同武装警察进行剧烈搏斗
    新华社二十二日讯　据东方通讯社报道：日本福冈县爱国工人、青年和学生约两千人二十一日在北九州市的小仓举行示威游行，反对向美国空军的山田弹药库运送侵越军火，强烈要求撤除美军在日本的军事设施。
    这一反美斗争，使由广岛县吴市美军基地用火车运往山田弹药库的美帝侵越军火被迫停运。
    二十一日上午，爱国工人、青年和学生在山田弹药库附近的中央公园举行了集会。大会强烈谴责佐藤反动政府同美帝国主义勾结，在美帝侵越战争中充当帮凶的罪行。
    一位代表在集会上讲话时，严厉驳斥日共宫本修正主义集团的议会主义谬论和对日本爱国学生的污蔑。他说：“日本人民不能把自己的活动局限在敌人容许的范围内。只有英勇地进行斗争，并坚持下去，才能取得胜利。”
    大会结束后，与会者高举红旗，斗志昂扬地向美军山田弹药库进发。“粉碎日美‘安全条约’”、“撤除山田弹药库”、“反对美帝侵略越南”、“打倒佐藤反动政府”等口号声响彻云霄。
    美军当局对英勇的日本人民的坚决斗争，怕得要死。美帝的看家狗佐藤反动政府赶紧出动武装警察对爱国工人、青年和学生进行残酷的镇压。然而，警察的法西斯镇压却激起了爱国群众的冲天怒火，一批示威者拥到弹药库的大门口，越过将近两米半高的铁栅栏，冲进弹药库，同武装警察进行了剧烈的搏斗。
    另一批示威者向警察猛烈地投掷石块，砸坏了大门口的检查哨所。示威者的英勇行动得到了爱国市民的热烈支持。
    佐藤政府妄图用镇压的手段使爱国群众停止活动，但示威群众不顾反动派的野蛮镇压，继续从山田弹药库向小仓车站进发，使通往小仓车站的交通瘫痪了一个半小时。
    二十一日上午，同福冈县人民在山田弹药库周围举行反美示威的活动相呼应，广岛县的爱国学生也在广车站举行了轰轰烈烈的示威，阻止装载美军弹药的列车从广岛县吴市的广车站开往山田弹药库。
