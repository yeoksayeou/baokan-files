	Xinhua News Agency, July 4th: Washington news: Hundreds of black youth in Seattle from July 1st to 3rd engaged in fierce struggles with fascist police for three consecutive days, protesting the reactionary authorities' persecution of black youth, and launched a new wave of anti-violence resistance.

	On July 1st, black youth in Seattle held a meeting at a high school in the black district, angrily exposing and protesting the reactionary authorities' persecution of three black students at the University of Washington. These three students were illegally sentenced to six months in prison for participating in a sit-in protest at a high school.

	When the police unreasonably disrupted the meeting and carried out suppression, the black youth present bravely stood up, using stones and Molotov cocktails to engage in fierce struggles with the police, and also smashed some police cars with stones.

	On July 2nd and 3rd, despite the police using tear gas and helicopters for mad suppression, the black youth still bravely fought back, dealing a heavy blow to the fascist police.

	Xinhua News Agency, July 4th: Washington news: Public transportation workers in Chicago, the second-largest city in the United States, began a strike on the evening of the 2nd, causing most of the city's buses, elevated trains, and subway trains to stop running, leading to severe paralysis in the city's public transportation.

	This is the first strike by Chicago's public transportation workers in over forty years. The striking workers demand the replacement of unsafe equipment and the right to take sick leave. The strikers protest the union leadership's failure to fight against the public transportation management authorities and to achieve reasonable demands for workers.

	On the 3rd, the strike continued to expand.
