		Statistics recently released by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics indicate that due to the escalation of the Vietnam War, inflation has become increasingly severe, causing U.S. prices to surge in May at a rate unseen in the past decade.

		The prices of goods that are essential to people's lives, such as clothing and food, saw the largest increases in May. Additionally, medical expenses rose by 13 percent compared to the same month last year.

		Even the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics had to admit that due to the rapid increase in prices, workers' purchasing power has declined compared to last year.

    美国物价上涨工人购买力降低
    美国劳工统计局不久前发表的数字表明，由于侵越战争不断“升级”引起了日益严重的通货膨胀，使五月份美国物价猛烈上涨，其速度之快为最近十多年所未见。
    五月份价格上涨幅度最大的商品是人民生活所必需的衣服和食品。此外，医疗费比去年同月上涨了百分之十三。
    连美国劳工统计局也不得不承认，由于物价急剧上涨，工人的购买力比去年又有所降低。
