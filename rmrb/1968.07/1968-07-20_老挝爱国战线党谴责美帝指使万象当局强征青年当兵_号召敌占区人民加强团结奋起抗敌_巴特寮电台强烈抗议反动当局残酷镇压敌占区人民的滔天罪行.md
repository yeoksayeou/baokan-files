The Lao Patriotic Front strongly condemns the US imperialists for instructing the Vientiane authorities to forcibly conscript youth into the military and expand the war of aggression. The Front calls on the people in the enemy-occupied areas to strengthen unity and rise up to resist the enemy.

The Bahtayluan Radio Station strongly protests the heinous crimes of the reactionary authorities in brutally suppressing the people in the enemy-occupied areas.

KANGO, July 18 (Xinhua) - According to a broadcast by the Bahtayluan Radio Station, the spokesperson for the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front issued a statement on July 13, strongly condemning the US imperialists for instructing the Vientiane authorities to forcibly conscript youth into the military and expand the war of aggression.

The statement said that after suffering a severe defeat in the dry season, the US imperialists and their lackeys are currently conducting large-scale conscription of young and middle-aged men aged 18 to 44. They also plan to conscript students who are underage but still in school. They aim to make up for the loss of more than 10,000 troops in the dry season and to hasten new military adventures.

The statement pointed out that this once again exposes the aggressive nature and war-mongering face of US imperialism, as well as the treacherous and ugly face of the Vientiane reactionary authorities who betray their country and people.

The statement warns the enemy that no matter how many troops they conscript, they will not be able to escape a complete defeat.

The statement calls on the people in the enemy-occupied areas to strengthen unity and rise up to resist the enemy's conscription, exposing and condemning the enemy's plot to expand the war.

KANGO, July 17 (Xinhua) - The Bahtayluan Radio Station broadcasted a commentary on July 16, strongly protesting the heinous crimes of the Vientiane reactionary authorities in brutally suppressing the people in the enemy-occupied areas of Laos.

The commentary said that in the areas temporarily controlled by the US imperialists and their lackeys, such as Vientiane City and other enemy-occupied areas, a white terror currently prevails. There, the Vientiane reactionary authorities are arbitrarily arresting and imprisoning innocent people, and continuously provoking and assassinating members of the Lao Patriotic Front's representative office in Vientiane. This fully exposes their treacherous and ugly faces of betraying their country and people.

The commentary pointed out that the Vientiane reactionary authorities' brutal suppression of the people in the enemy-occupied areas is an attempt to cover up their severe military defeats in the dry season.

The commentary demands that the Vientiane reactionary authorities must immediately stop the illegal detention, assassination, and suppression of innocent people in the enemy-occupied areas. They must immediately release the patriotic compatriots and foreign nationals who have been unlawfully detained. They must immediately stop the vile provocations and assassination plots against the members of the Lao Patriotic Front's representative office in Vientiane.

The commentary finally warns that the people in the liberated areas of Laos and the patriotic armed forces firmly support the people in the enemy-occupied areas in their struggle against violence. If the US imperialists and their lackeys insist on their ways and continue to illegally detain and brutally suppress the people, they will surely end up hurting themselves.

    巴特寮电台强烈抗议反动当局残酷镇压敌占区人民的滔天罪行
    新华社康开十八日电 据巴特寮电台广播：老挝爱国战线党中央发言人十三日发表声明，强烈谴责美帝国主义指使万象当局强征青年当兵，扩大侵略战争的罪恶阴谋。
    声明说，美帝国主义及其走狗在旱季遭到惨败后，目前正在大规模地强征从十八岁到四十四岁的青壮年，并且计划征召在校学习不足龄的青年入伍，妄图以此来弥补它们在旱季被歼一万多人的严重损失，加紧进行新的军事冒险。
    声明指出，这再一次暴露了美帝国主义的侵略本性和好战嘴脸，暴露了万象反动当局出卖祖国出卖人民的丑恶面目。
    声明警告敌人，不管他们再征多少兵，也绝不能逃脱彻底失败的命运。
    声明号召敌占区的人民加强团结，奋起反抗敌人征兵，揭露和谴责敌人扩大战争的阴谋。
    新华社康开十七日电巴特寮电台十六日广播一篇评论，强烈抗议万象反动当局残酷镇压老挝敌占区人民的滔天罪行。
    评论说，在美帝国主义及其走狗暂时控制的万象市和其他敌占区，目前正笼罩着一片白色恐怖。在那里，万象反动当局大肆逮捕和监禁无辜的人民，并不断地对老挝爱国战线党的驻万象代表机构的干部、战士进行挑衅和暗害。这充分暴露了它们出卖祖国出卖人民的丑恶嘴脸。
    评论指出，万象反动当局残酷镇压敌占区的人民的罪行，是企图掩盖它们旱季在军事上的惨重失败。
    评论要求万象反动当局必须立即停止对敌占区无辜人民进行非法拘捕、暗杀、镇压，必须立即释放被它们无理拘捕的爱国同胞和外国侨民，必须立即停止对老挝爱国战线党驻万象代表机构成员的卑劣挑衅和暗杀阴谋。
    评论最后警告说，老挝解放区的人民和爱国武装力量坚决支持敌占区人民的抗暴斗争。如果美帝国主义及其走狗，一意孤行，继续非法拘捕和野蛮镇压人民，那么，它们必将搬起石头打自己的脚。
