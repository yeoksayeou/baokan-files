The Revolutionary Committee of Hangu Saltworks in Hebei Province, with the assistance of the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team stationed there, has been following Chairman Mao's directive, "The most fundamental aspect of reforming state organs is to connect with the masses." They have been deeply embedded among the masses, closely linked with them, and actively accepting the criticism and supervision of revolutionary masses. The revolutionary masses have shown even greater love and support for the Revolutionary Committee, ensuring that the Committee, under the supervision of the masses, continues to strengthen and develop. The entire saltworks has completed its annual production plan half a year ahead of schedule.

Hangu Saltworks is a well-known large saltworks. After the Revolutionary Committee was established in January this year, its members have been deeply involved with the masses, consulting with them on all matters, and fighting shoulder to shoulder with them. The revolutionary situation and production at the saltworks have been improving. Revolutionary masses have praised, "The Revolutionary Committee is truly good!" Amidst the praise from the masses, some members of the Revolutionary Committee have become complacent and self-satisfied, feeling that they have done enough work in connecting with the masses. Therefore, some committee members, when they go down to the grassroots level, interact more with lower-level cadres and less with ordinary masses; they connect more with those who agree with them and less with those who have opposed them. At this time, a small group of class enemies took the opportunity to stir up trouble, attempting to sow discord between the masses and the Revolutionary Committee. The Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team promptly identified this problem, recognizing that a small group of class enemies are trying every means to sabotage the relationship between the newly established Revolutionary Committee and the masses, aiming to change the color of the proletarian dictatorship. Only by smashing the plots of the class enemies can we ensure the continuous development and consolidation of the Revolutionary Committee.

Subsequently, members of the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team and the Revolutionary Committee held a Mao Zedong Thought study class. They repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's teachings, "Never forget class struggle" and "We Communists are not seeking official posts, we are seeking revolution. We must all have a thorough revolutionary spirit. We must never, for a single moment, detach ourselves from the masses. As long as we do not detach ourselves from the masses, we are bound to be victorious." They fiercely criticized the revisionist line of China's Khrushchev, who sought to be an official and live like a lord, exposed the crimes of class enemies in disrupting the relationship between cadres and the masses, discussed the dangers of detaching from the masses, and delved into the root causes of detachment from the masses. This helped everyone realize that whether the members of the Revolutionary Committee can uphold the Party's tradition of closely connecting with the masses and actively accept the criticism and supervision of the revolutionary masses is a fundamental issue of loyalty to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. It is the fundamental mark that distinguishes the proletarian dictatorship from all exploiting class regimes. Only by broadly, frequently, and actively connecting with the masses and accepting their criticism and supervision can we timely discover the new moves of class enemies, lead the masses to launch attacks on the enemies; only then can we promptly convey Chairman Mao's latest instructions downwards and reflect the voices of the masses upwards, ensuring that the newly established Revolutionary Committee is deeply rooted among the masses, always closely linked with the broad masses, and united in flesh and blood.

After raising their awareness, the members of the Revolutionary Committee, with the help of the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team, went to various sub-saltworks, production teams, workers' homes, and collective dormitories. They held discussions, had heart-to-heart talks, worked together, and engaged in self-criticism and criticism of revisionism, adopting the attitude of a humble student, sincerely listening to the masses' criticisms and opinions. The head of the Revolutionary Committee, Zhang Guangde, originally the deputy secretary of the Party Committee, used his evenings to go to the dormitories and seek opinions from the masses. The revolutionary masses earnestly hoped that he would frequently go among the masses and lead them in carrying out revolutionary criticism. The criticisms from the revolutionary masses deeply moved him. He reviewed Chairman Mao's teachings and felt from the bottom of his heart that the criticisms from the masses were correct and affectionate. He expressed his determination to follow Chairman Mao's words, closely connect with the masses, and lead the masses in launching a fierce attack on the class enemies. The broad masses saw the sincere attitude of the Revolutionary Committee members and were very satisfied. They enthusiastically offered many suggestions to the Revolutionary Committee members. The Revolutionary Committee members felt that the criticisms from the revolutionary masses were factual, reasonable, and heartfelt, touching their hearts. Everyone said: Our connection with the masses is not nearly enough; it is still far from Chairman Mao's teachings.

The Revolutionary Committee members returned to the study class with the precious opinions from the masses. With the help of the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team, they reviewed Chairman Mao's teaching, "The masses are the real heroes," and decided to, with a thorough revolutionary spirit, go back among the masses again, repeatedly seek opinions from old workers and the broad masses, and seek their criticisms and help. They led revolutionary workers to actively attack the class enemies, exposing the evil plots of class enemies attempting to overthrow the newly established Revolutionary Committee. A standing committee member of the Revolutionary Committee, Jiao Ang, initially felt awkward interacting with those who had criticized him at the beginning of the Cultural Revolution. This time, Jiao Ang actively sought out those who had criticized him, seeking their opinions. The two had a heart-to-heart talk, and their relationship improved, becoming close friends.

The broad revolutionary masses at Hangu Saltworks saw that the Revolutionary Committee members actively accepted the supervision of the masses and were very satisfied. They emotionally said, "Leaders seek our opinions and make self-criticisms for their shortcomings and errors. Only the cadres cultivated by Chairman Mao can truly regard us workers as the real masters."

    汉沽盐场革委会坚决贯彻毛主席关于联系群众的教导
    革委会主动接受群众批评和监督
    广大群众更加爱护和支持革委会
    新华社石家庄二十一日电　河北省汉沽盐场革委会在驻场毛泽东思想宣传队帮助下，遵照毛主席“国家机关的改革，最根本的一条，就是联系群众”的教导，深入群众，紧密联系群众，主动接受革命群众的批评和监督，革命群众更加爱护和支持革委会，使革委会在革命群众的监督下不断巩固、发展，全场革命、生产形势越来越好。全场提前半年圆满完成了全年的生产计划。
    汉沽盐场是个有名的大盐场。革命委员会于今年一月成立以后，革委会成员深入群众，遇事同群众商量，跟群众并肩战斗，使盐场革命、生产形势越来越好。革命群众赞扬说：
  “革命委员会就是好！”在群众一片赞扬声中，部分革委会成员产生了骄傲自满情绪，觉得联系群众的工作做得差不多了。因此，有的委员下去以后，与基层干部接触的多，跟普通群众接触的少；跟自己意见一致的群众联系的多，跟反对过自己的群众联系的少。这时，一小撮阶级敌人乘隙而入，蠢蠢欲动，妄图挑拨群众和革委会之间的关系。毛泽东思想宣传队及时发现了这个问题，认为一小撮阶级敌人千方百计地想破坏新生的革命委员会同群众的关系，就是妄图使无产阶级政权改变颜色，只有粉碎阶级敌人的阴谋活动，才能保证革命委员会不断发展、巩固。
    接着，毛泽东思想宣传队的同志和革委会成员一起举办了毛泽东思想学习班。反复学习了毛主席
  “千万不要忘记阶级斗争”和“我们共产党人不是要做官，而是要革命，我们人人要有彻底的革命精神，我们不要有一时一刻脱离群众。只要我们不脱离群众，我们就一定会胜利”的教导，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫当官做老爷的反革命修正主义路线，大摆阶级敌人破坏干群关系的罪行，大论脱离群众的危害，大挖脱离群众的根源，使大家认识到：革委会成员能不能发扬党的紧密联系群众的作风、能不能主动接受革命群众的批评和监督，这是忠不忠于毛主席革命路线的根本问题，是区别无产阶级政权同一切剥削阶级政权的根本标志。只有广泛地、经常地联系群众，主动地接受群众的批评和监督，才能及时发现阶级敌人的新动向，率领群众主动向敌人进攻；才能随时随地把毛主席的最新指示传下去，随时把群众的呼声反映上来，使新生的革委会永远深深扎根于群众之中，始终和广大群众息息相关，血肉相连。
    认识提高以后，革委会成员在毛泽东思想宣传队帮助下，分头到各分场、各生产小组、职工家庭和集体宿舍，召开座谈会，一起谈心、一起劳动、一起斗私批修，以小学生的姿态，老老实实听取群众的批评和意见。革委会主任、原党委副书记张广得利用晚上时间深入到宿舍，找群众征求意见。革命群众语重心长地希望他经常深入群众，带领群众开展革命大批判。革命群众的批评使他震动很大，他重温了毛主席的教导，从心眼里感到群众批评很正确、很亲切。他表示坚决听毛主席的话，紧密联系群众，带领群众向阶级敌人发动猛烈进攻。广大群众看到革委会成员态度诚恳，都很满意，并且满腔热忱地给革委会成员提了许多意见。革委会成员感到革命群众的批评，有事实，有道理，语重心长，句句说到了他们的心坎上。大家说：我们联系群众不是差不多了，而是离毛主席的教导还差得很远。
    革委会成员带着群众提的宝贵意见又回到学习班里，在毛泽东思想宣传队的帮助下，重温毛主席“群众是真正的英雄”的教导，决心以彻底革命精神，再分头回到群众中，反复向老工人和广大职工征求意见，求得批评帮助，并带领革命职工主动向阶级敌人进攻，揭穿了阶级敌人企图颠覆新生的革命委员会的罪恶阴谋。革委会常委焦昂，开始在深入群众时，总不好意思接触在文化大革命初期给他提过意见的人。这次焦昂下去后，主动找给他提意见的人，征求他的意见，两个人互相交心，关系越来越好，成了一对知心朋友。
    汉沽盐场广大革命群众看到革委会成员主动接受群众监督，非常满意，激动地说：“领导干部向我们征求意见，有了缺点错误向我们作检查，只有毛主席培育出来的干部，才能把我们工人看成是真正的主人。”
