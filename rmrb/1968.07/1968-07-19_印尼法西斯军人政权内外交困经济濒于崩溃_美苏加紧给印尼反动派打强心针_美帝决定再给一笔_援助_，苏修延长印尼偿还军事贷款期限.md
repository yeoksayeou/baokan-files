The fascist military regime in Indonesia is facing internal and external difficulties, with its economy on the brink of collapse. The U.S. and the Soviet Union are rushing to give the Indonesian reactionaries a boost.

New York, July 19 (Xinhua) — The U.S. imperialists are hastening to give a boost to the fascist military regime in Indonesia, which is beset with internal and external troubles. The Soviet revisionists are also closely following suit.

The debt-ridden fascist military regime in Indonesia admits that it needs $325 million in foreign aid this year to maintain its reactionary rule. To prop up this fascist military regime so that it can better serve the U.S. imperialists' counter-revolutionary global strategy, the U.S. government has become the largest creditor of the Indonesian fascist military regime. According to Western news agencies, recently, the U.S. State Department issued a statement saying that the United States has decided to "provide $63 million in agricultural aid to Indonesia." This aid, along with the $47 million provided in February, totals $110 million, accounting for more than one-third of the total foreign aid needed by the Indonesian reactionary regime this year. The statement said that the United States is "ready at any time" to provide more wheat and flour to the fascist military regime in Indonesia this year. It said that the severely food-short fascist military regime in Indonesia has launched a campaign to "encourage" the consumption of U.S. wheat products at home. This shows that the Suharto-Nasution fascist military regime has turned Indonesia into a market for the dumping of surplus agricultural products by U.S. monopolies.

According to reports, U.S. Ambassador to Indonesia Green recently told the fascist military regime's leader Suharto in Jakarta that in the first half of this year, the U.S. government had provided an additional $15 million in wheat aid to Indonesia. He said that in this way, the total amount of aid provided by the United States to Indonesia this year has exceeded $125 million.

Following in the footsteps of U.S. imperialism is the ambitious Japanese reactionaries. According to Kyodo News, the Sato reactionary government in Japan recently decided to provide $110 million in aid to the fascist military regime in Indonesia this year. This decision made the Indonesian reactionary authorities overjoyed.

After the butcher, former U.S. Secretary of Defense McNamara, whose hands are stained with the blood of the Vietnamese people and the people of the world, visited Indonesia and Japan in June as the head of the World Bank, the United States and Japan accelerated their aid to Indonesia. During his activities in Japan, McNamara told the Sato reactionary government that the United States had decided to focus its aid on Indonesia. The Sato reactionary government, in order to adapt to the U.S. imperialists' strategy of invading Southeast Asia, openly stated: "Japan, in principle, adheres to the policy that McNamara hopes for."

The Soviet revisionists are also not willing to fall behind, closely following suit. According to reports, recently, Soviet Ambassador to Indonesia Sedyanko and the Indonesian fascist military regime's Foreign Minister Malik signed an agreement in Jakarta to extend the repayment period for the $800 million military loan given by the Soviet revisionists to the Indonesian reactionary regime. Malik joyfully said that the signing of this agreement has brought "Indonesia-Soviet relations into a new chapter." He said that the Soviet Union's agreement to extend the repayment of its debt means "great assistance to Indonesia from the Soviet Union," and at the same time also shows "understanding of Indonesia's economy" by the Soviet Union. In his speech, Soviet Ambassador Sedyanko thoroughly exposed the traitorous face of the Soviet revisionist ruling clique. He said without hesitation: "The Soviet Union has always considered strengthening relations with Indonesia to be important," and "the Soviet government is ready to provide political, economic, and financial assistance to Indonesia."

The fascist military regime in Indonesia, whose domestic economy is already on the brink of collapse, has also begged for aid from the Netherlands, Spain, Britain, Australia, New Zealand, Belgium, France, Canada, and West Germany this year.

    印尼法西斯军人政权内外交困经济濒于崩溃
    美苏加紧给印尼反动派打强心针
    美帝决定再给一笔“援助”，苏修延长印尼偿还军事贷款期限
    新华社讯　雅加达消息：美帝国主义正在加紧给内外交困的印尼法西斯军人政权打强心针，苏修叛徒集团也紧紧跟上。
    负债累累的印尼法西斯军人政权供认，今年需要三亿二千五百万美元“外援”来维持它的反动统治。为了扶持这个法西斯军人政权，以便使它更好地为美帝国主义的反革命全球战略效劳，美国政府成了印尼法西斯军人政权的最大债主。据西方通讯社透露，最近，美国国务院发表公告说，美国决定“以农产品形式向印尼提供六千三百万美元的援助”。这笔“援助”加上今年二月份提供的四千七百万美元，总数已达一亿一千万美元，占今年印尼反动政权所需“外援”总数的三分之一以上。公告说，美国“还随时准备”在今年向印尼法西斯军人政权提供更多的小麦和面粉。它说，严重缺粮的印尼法西斯军人政权在国内发动了一个“鼓励”吃美国小麦产品的运动。这说明，苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯军人政权已经把印尼变为美国垄断资本倾销“剩余农产品”的市场。
    另据报道，美国驻印尼大使格林最近在雅加达对法西斯军人政权头目苏哈托说，今年上半年，美国政府还额外向印尼提供了一千五百多万美元的小麦“援助”。他说，这样，今年美国向印尼提供的“援助”总额已经超过一亿二千五百万美元。
    紧跟美帝国主义脚步的是野心勃勃的日本反动派。据共同社透露，日本佐藤反动政府最近决定今年向印尼法西斯军人政权提供一亿一千万美元“援助”。这个决定使印尼反动当局欢喜若狂。
    在双手沾满越南人民和世界人民鲜血的刽子手、前美国国防部长麦克纳马拉六月间以“世界银行”头目的身份先后到印尼和日本活动以后，美国和日本加速了“援助”印尼的步伐。麦克纳马拉在日本活动期间向佐藤反动政府表示：美国决定把“援助”重点放在印尼。佐藤反动政府为了适应美帝国主义侵略东南亚的战略需要，公开表示：“日本在原则上奉行麦克纳马拉所希望的政策”。
    苏修叛徒集团也不甘落后，紧紧跟上。据报道，最近，苏修驻印尼大使塞坚科和印尼法西斯军人政权外交部长马利克在雅加达签订了关于延长偿还苏修给印尼反动政权的八亿美元军事贷款期限的议定书。马利克兴高采烈地说，这个议定书的签订，使“印尼和苏联的关系进入了新的篇章”。他说，苏修“同意印尼延期偿还它的债务意味着苏联（对印尼）的巨大援助，同时也表明（苏联）对印尼经济的谅解”。苏修大使塞坚科在讲话中彻底暴露了苏修统治集团的叛徒嘴脸。他毫不掩饰地说：“苏联始终认为加强同印尼的关系是重要的”，“苏联政府准备（向印尼）提供政治、经济和财政援助”。
    国内经济已经濒于崩溃的印尼法西斯军人政权，今年以来还向荷兰、西班牙、英国、澳大利亚、新西兰、比利时、法国、加拿大、西德乞讨“援助”。
