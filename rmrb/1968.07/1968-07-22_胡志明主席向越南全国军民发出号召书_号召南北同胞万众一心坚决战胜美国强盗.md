Chairman Ho Chi Minh issued a call to the Vietnamese people and military on July 20, urging them to unite and decisively defeat the American aggressors.

The call said: Fourteen years ago, the great victory at Dien Bien Phu led to the signing of the Geneva Accords, which recognized our Vietnamese people's independence, sovereignty, unity, and territorial integrity. Originally, by July 1956, our people should have held general elections, and our country should have been completely independent, free, peaceful, and united, with the North and South reuniting.

However, the war-mongering U.S. imperialists reneged on their own promises and blatantly violated the Geneva Accords. They set up a puppet regime and launched an invasion of our South. But they were met with extremely courageous resistance from our Southern compatriots and soldiers, and suffered heavy defeats. For over three years, to salvage their passive and bogged-down situation in the South, they launched a frenzied bombing and attack campaign against the North. They destroyed the independence, peace, and neutrality of Laos and continually threatened and provoked the Kingdom of Cambodia.

The call said: The invasion war that the United States is currently waging on our land is the most brutal war in human history. The American aggressors mistakenly believed that with over a hundred thousand troops, including more than fifty thousand American soldiers, and the power of modern weapons, they could subjugate our people. The facts are completely the opposite. The heroic Southern compatriots and soldiers, and the entire heroic Vietnamese nation, have risen up with unyielding determination, united as one, and fought with unparalleled bravery, foiling all of the enemy's military and political plans, and achieving many increasingly great victories.

The call said: Since the early spring of 1968, the resistance in the South has entered a new phase: Southern compatriots and soldiers have launched a general offensive and simultaneous uprisings in various cities, achieving many glorious feats, shocking the United States, and shaking the five continents. The establishment of the National Liberation Front is a great victory for the policy of national unity and resistance against American aggression to save the country, further exposing the aggressive and traitorous faces of the American puppet regime, and further isolating them. In the North, over three thousand American aggressor planes have been shot down. Indeed, "the North and South are fighting well." The U.S. imperialists are suffering more and more defeats and will definitely suffer a complete failure.

However, the nature of the American aggressors is unchangeable until death; they remain extremely obstinate. They continue to strengthen the war in the South, brutally attack cities, and destroy many rural areas, while frenziedly attacking the southern provinces of the North. U.S. imperialism still refuses to abandon its evil war of aggression and stubbornly clings to our South, attempting to permanently divide our motherland.

The call said: Facing this serious situation, our entire people must persist and strengthen the resistance war against American aggression to save the country. For independence and freedom, our 31 million compatriots are determined to overcome all difficulties, make any sacrifice, and fight to the end. The American aggressors are becoming more and more passive and suffering more defeats, facing a dead end. Our entire military and people are in a position of active offense, fighting more fiercely, and achieving greater victories.

Southern compatriots and soldiers, closely united under the glorious banner of the National Liberation Front, will fight even more fiercely and achieve even greater victories.

Northern compatriots and soldiers must always be vigilant, fight bravely, launch production competitions, defeat the enemy's war of destruction, be ready at any time to smash their new escalation plots, and wholeheartedly support our flesh-and-blood South, fulfilling the duty of the rear to the front.

Our entire people, North and South as one, will resolutely fight, determined to defeat the American aggressors, liberate the South, defend the North, and ultimately achieve the peaceful reunification of our country.

The call said: Our people love peace very much, but there must be true independence and freedom to have true peace. Our position is very just and clear: whenever the U.S. imperialists stop their war of aggression against our country, stop bombing and attacking the North, withdraw all American troops and their mercenaries from South Vietnam, and allow our people to freely resolve their internal affairs, peace will immediately be restored. This is the wish of our people and also the wish of the progressive people of the United States and the peace-loving and justice-supporting people of the world. The only way to restore peace is for the American troops and their mercenaries to withdraw completely! Vietnam belongs to the Vietnamese!

The call concluded: Our Vietnamese nation is waging the greatest resistance war in our history. Justice is on our side. We have the unyielding will to fight to the end. We have the invincible power of national unity and the sympathy and support of all progressive humanity.

The U.S. imperialists will definitely be defeated!

Our people will definitely be victorious!

All compatriots and soldiers, advance bravely!

    胡志明主席向越南全国军民发出号召书
    号召南北同胞万众一心坚决战胜美国强盗
    新华社河内二十一日电　胡志明主席二十日向越南全国军民发出号召书，号召越南军民万众一心，坚决战胜美国侵略强盗。
    号召书说：十四年前，由于伟大的奠边府大捷，日内瓦协议得以签订，承认了我们越南民族的独立、主权、统一和领土完整。本来早在一九五六年七月，我国人民就应该举行普选，我国就应该完全独立、自由、和平、统一，北方和南方就应该欢聚一堂了。
    但是，好战的美帝国主义背弃它们自己的诺言，明目张胆地破坏了日内瓦协议。它扶植起卖国傀儡政权，对我国南方进行了侵略战争。然而，它遭到了我国南方同胞和战士的极其英勇的抗击，并且遭到了惨重的失败。三年多来，它为了挽救在南方的被动和深陷泥潭的处境，对北方进行了疯狂的轰炸和袭击。它破坏了老挝的独立、和平与中立，不断地对柬埔寨王国进行威胁和挑衅。
    号召书说：美国目前在我国土地上进行的侵略战争，是人类历史上最残暴的一场战争。美国强盗错误地以为它用包括五十多万美军在内的一百多万军队，用现代化武器的威力，就可以使我国人民屈服。事实完全相反。英雄的南方同胞和战士，整个英雄的越南民族，毅然奋身而起，万众一心，无比英勇地战斗，挫败了敌人的一切军事和政治计划，取得了许多日益巨大的胜利。
    号召书说：从一九六八年初春以来，南方的抗战进入了一个新时期：南方同胞和战士向各城市发动了总进攻和同时奋起斗争，立下了许多辉煌的战功，震惊了美国，震撼了五大洲。民族、民主及和平力量联盟的成立，是全民团结抗美救国政策的巨大胜利，使美伪集团更加清楚地暴露了它们的侵略和卖国面目，更加陷于孤立。在北方，击落了三千多架美国强盗飞机。的确是“南北两方打得好”。美帝国主义输得越来越惨，一定将遭到彻底失败。
    然而，美国强盗的本性是至死不变的，它们仍然十分顽固。它们仍然在南方继续强化战争，极其野蛮地袭击城市，摧毁许多农村地区，同时疯狂地袭击北方的南部各省。美帝国主义仍然不肯放弃它罪恶的侵略战争，仍然死赖在我国南方，妄图长期分割我们的祖国。
    号召书说：面对这种严重局势，我们全国人民更要坚持并加强抗美救国战争，为了独立和自由，我国三千一百万同胞决心克服一切困难，不惜牺牲，决战决胜。美国侵略者越来越陷于被动和遭到失败，日暮途穷。我们全国军民正处于主动进攻之势，打得越来越猛，胜利越来越大。
    南方同胞和战士广泛地紧密团结在民族解放阵线的光荣旗帜下，必将打得更猛，取得更加伟大的胜利。
    北方同胞和战士必须时刻提高警惕，英勇战斗，开展生产竞赛，打败敌人的破坏性战争，随时准备粉碎它们的一切新的升级阴谋，并且全心全力地支援骨肉的南方，履行大后方对大前线的任务。
    我们全国人民南北一心，坚决抗战，决心战胜美国侵略强盗，解放南方，保卫北方，进而和平统一祖国。
    号召书说：我国人民十分热爱和平，但是必须有真正的独立与自由，才有真正的和平。我们的立场十分正当和明确：什么时候美帝国主义停止对我国的侵略战争，停止对北方的轰炸和袭击，把美国军队及其帮凶军全部撤出越南南方，让我国人民自由地解决自己的内部事务，那时和平就会立即恢复。这是我国人民的愿望，也是美国进步人民和世界上爱好和平与主持正义的人民的愿望。恢复和平的唯一办法，是美国军队及其帮凶军必须全部撤回国去！越南属于越南人！
    号召书最后说：我们越南民族正在进行一次我国历史上最伟大的抗战。正义在我们一边。我们有决战决胜的坚强意志。我们有全民团结的无敌力量，并且得到全体进步人类的同情和支持。
    美帝国主义必败！
    我国人民必胜！
    全国同胞和战士们奋勇前进！
