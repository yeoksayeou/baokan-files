We two are both in our seventies and eighties. We have never seen a play as good as *The Red Lantern*. In this play, the Li family, spanning three generations, are all exemplary: Grandma Li, though old, has a heart of red, she is a good revolutionary mother; Li Yuhe is steadfast and unyielding, a hero of iron; Little Iron Girl is spirited and strong, a good revolutionary descendant. They fear neither threats nor temptations; they would rather die standing than live kneeling. The predecessors fall, and the successors carry on the red lantern. Revolutionary spirit is passed down from generation to generation, fully demonstrating the lofty revolutionary qualities of our working class. That coward, Chinese Khrushchev, says that one can turn traitor to save one's life, which is the face of a shameless traitor. We workers, following Chairman Mao, are always at the forefront, never fearing death.

*The Red Lantern* is closely related to our "February 7th" strike! Li Yuhe's master and fellow apprentice were martyred during the "February 7th" strike. Later, Grandma Li, Li Yuhe, and Little Iron Girl became one family, passing down the revolutionary torch, the red lantern that lights the way. The revolutionary fire burns brighter and brighter! Thinking back to the "February 7th" strike, it was the Party that taught us to organize and fight against the enemy. We were resolute in our struggle! Our workers' patrol squad seized guns from the enemy, stopped trains, and never feared the enemy. Although some comrades were martyred and others imprisoned, we fought the enemy resolutely. Our revolutionary spirit was tempered, and our hatred for the enemy deepened. In *The Red Lantern*, when we see the enemy's torture of Li Yuhe, it feels like it's happening to us. We hate the enemy so much that we grind our teeth. Li Yuhe is truly a hero of steel. No matter what torture the enemy inflicted, he didn't utter a word, and he cursed the enemy and traitors. We felt greatly avenged and deeply admired! *The Red Lantern* greatly boosted our morale and crushed the enemy's arrogance; it established the image of proletarian heroes and set a shining example for our descendants.

"Plant what kind of sapling, bear what kind of fruit; sow what kind of seed, bloom what kind of flower." With predecessors like Li Yuhe and Grandma Li, there will be successors like Little Iron Girl. Little Iron Girl is truly spirited. At seventeen, she helped her father carry the revolutionary burden. When Grandma and Father were martyred, she, with a heart full of hatred for the enemy, took up the revolutionary red lantern, following in the footsteps of her predecessors, continuing to advance, and completing her father's unfinished revolutionary cause. This play is good because it shows us the direction. After watching the play, we know what kind of work to do, what kind of person to be; what path young people should take, whose legacy to carry on, and what traditions to inherit and carry forward.

We old workers, from the "February 7th" strike to now, have remained steadfast for decades. We must ensure that though our bodies age, our hearts remain red. We must read Chairman Mao's books every day and care about state affairs. We must learn from Li Yuhe and Grandma Li. Learn their unwavering loyalty to Chairman Mao and the revolutionary cause; learn their revolutionary virtues and maintain their integrity; learn their concern for the youth, and cultivate our descendants to be as red as Little Iron Girl, ensuring that our socialist country will never change color!

The red lantern in *The Red Lantern* is a guiding light, lighting our revolutionary path. Those old plays were full of emperors, generals, scholars, and beauties, ghosts, and monsters, all poisoning people. We old people get angrier the more we watch them, and the young people are also influenced badly. Watching revolutionary model operas educates everyone, old and young. Revolutionary model operas are good! Chinese Khrushchev opposed performing revolutionary modern plays and opposed workers, peasants, and soldiers being the masters of the stage. He let traitor plays and ghost plays be performed extensively, letting ghosts and monsters freely poison the stage, which is extremely reactionary! Comrade Jiang Qing raised high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and fought resolutely against Chinese Khrushchev. She personally led revolutionary cultural warriors to create eight revolutionary model operas like *The Red Lantern*, driving away emperors, generals, scholars, and beauties, and finally letting workers, peasants, and soldiers truly become the masters of the stage! All this is thanks to Chairman Mao's leadership. We are deeply grateful to Chairman Mao from the bottom of our hearts.

    学英雄的榜样，传革命的红灯
    参加过“二·七”大罢工的老工人  刘炳波  张宝玉
    我们两个人都七、八十岁了，从来没有看到过象《红灯记》这样的好戏。在这出戏里，李玉和一家祖孙三代都是好样的：李奶奶人老心红，是革命的好妈妈；李玉和坚贞不屈，是铁打的英雄；小铁梅志气刚强，是革命的好后代。他们不怕威逼，不受利诱；宁肯站着死，决不跪着生。前人倒下了，后人接红灯，革命精神代代相传，充分地表现了咱们工人阶级崇高的革命品质。中国赫鲁晓夫这个怕死鬼，胡说什么为了活命可以变节自首，完全是一副无耻叛徒的嘴脸。咱们工人跟着毛主席干革命，都是冲在前头打先锋，从来就没把死搁在心上。
    这《红灯记》和咱们“二·七”大罢工关系可亲啦！李玉和的师傅和师兄就是在“二·七”大罢工那阵英勇牺牲的。后来李奶奶、李玉和、小铁梅三姓合成一家，留下了革命的火种，传下来照路的红灯，革命的烈火越烧越旺！想想当年“二·七”大罢工那阵，是党教会我们组织起来跟敌人斗争的。我们那时斗争可坚决啦！我们工人纠察队向敌人夺枪、截车，根本不把敌人放在眼里。虽然有的同志牺牲了，有的同志被抓去坐牢，但是，我们坚决和敌人斗争，革命的心被炼得更红了，对敌人的仇恨更深了。我们在《红灯记》里看到鸠山严刑拷打李玉和，就觉得象打在自己身上一样，我们恨敌人恨得直咬牙。李玉和真是钢铁英雄，不管敌人上什么刑，他就是一个字也不说，一个劲地骂敌人，骂叛徒，我们听着十分解恨！万分钦佩！《红灯记》大长了我们的志气，大灭了敌人的威风；立起了无产阶级的英雄形象，为我们子子孙孙树立了光辉的榜样。
      “栽什么树苗结什么果，撒什么种子开什么花”。有李玉和、李奶奶这样的好前辈，就有铁梅那样的后来人。小铁梅可真有志气，十七岁就帮助爹爹挑革命重担。奶奶、爹爹牺牲了，她怀着对敌人满腔的仇恨，接过革命的红灯，踏着先辈的血迹，继续前进，去完成爹爹未完成的革命事业。这戏好就好在给我们指明了方向。看了戏就知道做事要做什么样的事，做人要做什么样的人；青年人应当走什么路，接谁的班，应该继承、发扬什么传统。
    我们这些老工人，从“二·七”到如今，几十年如一日，红心向党。我们要做到人老心不老，人老心更红。天天读毛主席的书，关心国家大事。我们要好好向李玉和、李奶奶学习。学他们对毛主席、对革命事业的无限忠心，至死不变；学他们的革命品德，保持晚节；学他们关心青年，把我们的子子孙孙都培养成铁梅那样的红后代，保证我们的社会主义江山永不变颜色！
    《红灯记》里的红灯，是照路的明灯，照着我们走革命的路。过去那些老戏，尽唱些帝王将相，才子佳人，妖魔鬼怪，都是毒害人的。我们老年人越看越生气，小青年看了也受到坏影响。看革命样板戏，男女老少都受教育。革命样板戏就是好！中国赫鲁晓夫不让演革命现代戏，反对咱们工农兵当舞台的主人。他却让叛徒戏、鬼戏大演特演，让牛鬼蛇神爬到咱们舞台上自由地放毒，真是反动透顶！江青同志高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，与中国赫鲁晓夫进行了坚决的斗争。她亲自领着革命的文艺战士编出了《红灯记》这样的八个革命样板戏，把帝王将相、才子佳人通通赶走，咱们工农兵才真正做了舞台的主人！这全靠毛主席领导得好啊，我们打心眼里感谢毛主席。
