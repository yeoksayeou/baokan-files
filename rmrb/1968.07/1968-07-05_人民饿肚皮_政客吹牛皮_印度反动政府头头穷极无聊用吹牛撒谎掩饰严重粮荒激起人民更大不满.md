People Starve While Politicians Blow Hot Air

The reactionary government of India, in a desperate and pathetic attempt to cover up the severe food shortage, has resorted to bragging and lying, which has only further infuriated the people.

New Delhi, July 3 (Xinhua) — High-ranking officials of the Indian reactionary government have recently resorted to bragging and lying to cover up the severe economic difficulties and food shortages in the country. However, even some bourgeois newspapers in India and Britain have deemed these clumsy tactics ineffective.

Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi recently boasted in Australia that India would achieve self-sufficiency in food within three years and economic self-sufficiency within five years. Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Morarji Desai claimed on June 24 that India would stop importing food in two to three years. Recently, the Indian government has been using all its propaganda machines to boast about last year's "bumper harvest" and the prospect of economic improvement this year.

However, recently, states such as Assam, Mysore, West Bengal, Bihar, Orissa, and Andhra Pradesh have reported severe famines. In Assam, about 100,000 people have not had a meal in days. According to a report by the British Financial Times on June 20, despite some rain last year, India's grain production still falls far short of domestic needs.

Not long ago, the Indian reactionary government pretended to order its so-called "Planning Commission" to come up with a "plan" to reduce foreign economic "aid" by half starting next year. It was revealed that to achieve this, India's export volume must increase by 7% annually. The Financial Times quoted the opinions of many high-ranking Indian officials, saying that this is impossible to achieve. Despite the Indian reactionary government's desperate efforts to increase exports, India's export volume has not increased over the past two years.

It is revealed that the Indian Planning Commission hopes to squeeze some money from the profits of government-run enterprises to alleviate economic difficulties, but many of these enterprises are operating at a loss. For example, the Hindustan Steel Company, which manages three government-run steel plants, lost 400 million rupees last year.

The Indian bourgeois newspaper Indian Express revealed that due to the need to repay a large amount of foreign debt, the Indian government's foreign exchange reserves are still in a very difficult situation this year.

Under these circumstances, a recent meeting of the highest authority of the ruling party (the All-India Congress Committee) saw many Congress Party members panicking and shouting that a situation similar to that in France could arise in India due to the worsening economic and political situation at home. They demanded that the Congress reactionary government quickly take measures to deceive Indian youth and the people.

    人民饿肚皮　政客吹牛皮
    印度反动政府头头穷极无聊用吹牛撒谎掩饰严重粮荒激起人民更大不满
    新华社三日讯　新德里消息：印度反动政府的高级官员最近乞灵于吹牛、撒谎的办法来掩饰国内严重经济困难和粮荒，但是这种拙劣的伎俩，连印度和英国的一些资产阶级报刊也认为骗不了人。
    印度总理英迪拉·甘地最近在澳大利亚活动时，大言不惭地宣称印度将在三年内做到粮食不依赖外援，五年内经济不依赖外援。副总理兼财政部长德赛六月二十四日也吹牛说，印度在两、三年后不再进口粮食。近来，印度政府开动各种宣传机器，大吹大擂说什么去年“大丰收”，今年经济好转有望。
    但是，最近阿萨姆、迈索尔、西孟加拉、比哈尔、奥里萨、安得拉等邦，纷纷传出了严重饥荒的消息。阿萨姆邦大约十万人几天吃不上一顿饭。据英国《金融时报》六月二十日报道，尽管去年下了些雨，但是印度粮食产量还远远满足不了国内的需要。
    不久以前，印度反动政府装模作样地下令它的一个所谓“计划委员会”作出一个“计划”，规定从明年起五年内把外国经济“援助”减少一半。据透露，要做到这一点，印度的出口额每年必须增加百分之七。《金融时报》引述许多印度高级官员的意见说，这是不可能做到的。尽管印度反动政府拚命设法增加出口，但过去两年来印度出口额却没有增加。
    据透露，印度计划委员会妄想从印度政府的官办企业的利润中捞点油水，来缓和经济困难，但是许多官办企业却在亏本。例如管理三家官办钢铁厂的印度斯坦钢铁公司，去年亏本达四亿卢比之多。
    印度资产阶级报纸《印度斯坦时报》透露，由于要大量偿还外债本息，印度政府今年的外汇储备状况仍然非常困难。
    在这种情况下，最近执政党的最高权力机构（全印国大党委员会）举行的一次会议上，许多国大党员惊慌地叫喊说，由于国内经济和政治情况恶化，象在法国出现的那样的形势有可能在印度出现。他们要求国大党反动政府赶快采取措施来欺骗印度的青年和人民。
