A brilliant oil painting—*Chairman Mao Goes to Anyuan*—is displayed before us. The radiance of the red sun instantly illuminates our hearts.

Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! Your wise and resolute countenance shows that you have found the path of Marxism-Leninism for the Chinese people; your piercing gaze seems to penetrate the clouds and fog, envisioning the splendid future of New China and a new world; your boundless chest is filled with the grand ambition to liberate all humanity; your towering figure bears the historic mission of world revolution; your clenched fist, strong and powerful, is ready to smash the three great mountains oppressing the Chinese people; your vigorous and heroic strides lead the revolutionary people of China forward bravely!

Gazing at the glorious and great image of Chairman Mao in his youth, we are filled with passion and our blood boils! It feels as if we have returned to forty-seven years ago.

In the autumn of 1921, a thunderous roar shook the heavens and earth, and the red sun shone upon Anyuan Mountain. Our great leader, Chairman Mao, had just personally founded the great Communist Party of China. He then traveled day and night, undeterred by hardships, to Anyuan, igniting the spark of revolution. Upon arriving in Anyuan, Chairman Mao went down into the mines, entered the workers' dormitories, and immersed himself among the workers, becoming one with them. He investigated the social conditions and understood the workers' hardships. Chairman Mao sat with the workers, discussing and inspiring their revolutionary spirit, urging them to form a strong united front, to overthrow the three great mountains oppressing them, and to establish a new government where the laboring people are masters.

The oil painting *Chairman Mao Goes to Anyuan* is a brilliant epitome of our great helmsman, Chairman Mao, leading the Chinese revolution from victory to victory. It vividly recreates the great revolutionary deeds of Chairman Mao in Anyuan in 1921, shortly after the founding of the Communist Party of China, successfully portraying Chairman Mao in his youth as a man of great responsibility, deeply connected with the masses, relying on the workers and peasants, daring to struggle, and daring to revolution. It powerfully demonstrates that Red Anyuan is the sacred land of the workers' movement personally pioneered by our great teacher, Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao is the most outstanding leader of the workers' movement, the most brilliant helmsman of the Chinese and world revolutions, and the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time.

The oil painting *Chairman Mao Goes to Anyuan* is excellent! It not only has a high level of thought and extremely profound and powerful political content; artistically, this oil painting also strives to achieve the unity of revolutionary political content and the most perfect artistic form. It follows Chairman Mao's directive to "make the past serve the present and foreign things serve China," fully utilizing the distinctive features of oil painting—clear layers, majestic momentum, and rich expressiveness—and absorbing the concise composition and vivid colors of Chinese painting. It highlights the glorious and great image of Chairman Mao, fully capturing his spirit.

Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's revolutionary literary and artistic line and with the warm care of Comrade Jiang Qing, the Red Guards of the capital have risen up to rebel against the literary and artistic black line! With hearts full of boundless love and loyalty to Chairman Mao, they have combined with the workers, peasants, and soldiers, broken superstitions, and displayed great revolutionary pioneering spirit. They have utilized collective strength and wisdom, through repeated practice, and finally successfully created the oil painting *Chairman Mao Goes to Anyuan*, opening up a new horizon in artistic creation. This painting is a product of the struggle between the two lines, a new achievement of Chairman Mao's revolutionary literary and artistic line, a highly successful artistic treasure that has emerged during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and a song of victory for Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

    心中升起红太阳
    安展
    一幅光采夺目的油画——《毛主席去安源》，展现在我们面前。红太阳的光辉，顿时照亮了我们的心。
    毛主席啊，毛主席！您那英明坚毅的面容，显示您在深思，为中国人民找到了马克思列宁主义道路；您那炯炯有神的目光，仿佛正透过乌云迷雾，展望着新中国和新世界的灿烂远景；您无比开阔的胸襟，满怀着解放全人类的宏伟抱负；您魁梧高大的身躯，担负起世界革命的历史重任；您攥着刚劲有力的铁拳，要砸烂压在中国人民头上的三座大山；您踏着雄健豪迈的步伐，率领中国革命人民奋勇前进！
    凝望着毛主席青年时期光辉伟大的形象，我们激情满怀，热血沸腾！仿佛回到了四十七年前。
    一九二一年秋天，霹雳一声天地动，红日照亮了安源山。我们伟大的领袖毛主席，刚刚亲手缔造了伟大的中国共产党，又日夜奔波，不辞艰辛，来到安源，点燃革命火种。毛主席一到安源，就下矿井，进工棚，深入到工人群众中，和工人打成一片，考察社会状况，了解工人疾苦。毛主席和工人促膝攀谈，启发工人的革命造反精神，号召他们结成坚强的团体，掀掉压在头上的三座大山，建立劳动人民当家作主的新政权。
    油画《毛主席去安源》，正是我们伟大舵手毛主席领导中国革命从胜利走向胜利的光辉缩影。它形象地再现了一九二一年中国共产党诞生以后，毛主席在安源领导中国工人运动的伟大革命壮举，成功地塑造了毛主席在青年时期以天下为己任，深入群众，依靠工农，敢于斗争，敢于革命的光辉形象。它有力地表明：红色安源，是我们伟大导师毛主席亲手开拓的工人运动光辉圣地。毛主席，是工人运动最杰出的领袖，是中国革命和世界革命最英明的舵手，是当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者。
    油画《毛主席去安源》好得很！它不但有高度的思想水平，有极其深刻、强烈的政治内容；在艺术上，这幅油画也努力达到了“革命的政治内容和尽可能完美的艺术形式的统一。”它按照毛主席“古为今用，洋为中用”的指示，充分发挥了油画艺术层次分明，气势雄伟，富于表现力的特色，又吸取了中国画构图简练、色调鲜明的风格，突出了毛主席光辉伟大的形象，把毛主席的神采表现得很充分。
    在毛主席革命文艺路线的指引下，在江青同志的亲切关怀下，首都红卫兵小将奋起造了文艺黑线的反！他们怀着对毛主席无比热爱、无比忠诚的红心，和工农兵群众相结合，破除迷信，发扬了大无畏的革命首创精神，发挥了集体的力量和智慧，经过反复实践，终于成功地创作了油画《毛主席去安源》，开了美术创作的新生面。这幅油画，是两条路线斗争的产物，是毛主席革命文艺路线的新成果，是无产阶级文化大革命中涌现出来的极其成功的艺术珍品，是毛主席革命路线胜利的赞歌。
