When we heard the news that our great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin had watched and listened to the new revolutionary art form of piano accompaniment for the revolutionary opera "The Red Lantern," which was nurtured and guided by Comrade Jiang Qing, our hearts were filled with indescribable excitement and joy. Instantly, I found myself gathering with some revolutionary comrades from the music and Peking opera circles. Our shared topic and shared joy made our conversation exceptionally lively. This is another triumphant song of Mao Zedong Thought, another flower blooming with the radiance of Mao Zedong Thought, another powerful cannon shot aimed at the class enemy. Let us shout with all our hearts: Long live the victory of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line in the arts!

Chairman Mao once wrote in a letter to the Yan'an Drama Academy: "History is created by the people, but on the old stage (in all literature and art that is detached from the people) the people are reduced to dregs, while the stage is dominated by masters, mistresses, young masters, and young ladies. This inversion of history is now being inverted again by you, restoring history to its true face." On the old stage of the arts, piano art, like Peking opera, ballet, and symphonic music, all inverted history. They were impregnable fortresses. Such a thing, which had always been confined to the palaces and chambers of feudal lords and the bourgeoisie, has now surprisingly appeared on the revolutionary art stage of the workers, peasants, and soldiers. This was unimaginable in the past.

Such a thing, which had always been praised by foreign and Chinese masters, mistresses, young masters, and young ladies as the "jewel in the crown of musical art," used to express their decadent and declining thoughts and feelings, beautify their exploitative and ugly lives, and even participate in "international competitions" to engage in "peaceful competition" schemes, has now surprisingly become a powerful weapon for expressing the heroic spirit of the proletariat and shaping the image of proletarian heroes. This was also unimaginable in the past.

Such an ancient Western instrument has now surprisingly combined organically and harmoniously with the ancient Chinese Peking opera music (singing and percussion), powerfully propagating Mao Zedong Thought. This was even more unimaginable in the past.

The creation and performance of the piano accompaniment for "The Red Lantern" have once again shown us the immense power of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. Only by firmly implementing Chairman Mao's teachings of "making the past serve the present, making foreign things serve China," and "breaking down before building up" can such miracles happen. Only through the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution personally initiated by Chairman Mao can such harvests be reaped. Only Chairman Mao's revolutionary line can seize such tools that have long been controlled by the bourgeoisie and turn them into the property of the proletariat and the working people, can capture such a fortress, and can invert the inverted history again. Let us shout a thousand times, ten thousand times: Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!

From the piano accompaniment for "The Red Lantern," we see the great power and boundless future of piano art under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought. It is good at expressing various dramatic atmospheres and shaping various character images. What is particularly worth noting is its achievement in shaping heroic images. "After listening to Grandma talk about the red lantern, few words but profound meaning." The accompaniment for these two lines is a very outstanding example. Here, it shows the advantages that the "four essentials" of Peking opera do not have. This piece of music is used to express Li Tiemei's corresponding imaginative activities triggered by the red lantern. Here, the accompaniment of the "four essentials" of Peking opera always makes one feel that the imaginative realm of the characters is narrow, near, and shallow, as if the characters are only thinking about what is right in front of them; while the piano accompaniment makes one feel that the imaginative realm of the characters is wide, far, and deep, not only thinking about what is right in front of them, but also thinking about what happened before and what will happen after. From the comparison of several singing sections of Li Tiemei (such as "My uncle" and "When I think of the enemy, my heart burns"), we can clearly see the development and growth process of the thoughts, character, and temperament of this heroic character. These characteristics are important inspirations for the creation of revolutionary Peking opera music. Therefore, the appearance of this new form not only has great significance for the revolution of piano music but also plays a great role in promoting the revolution of Peking opera.

"The flowers on the battlefield are particularly fragrant." The birth of the new form of piano accompaniment for "The Red Lantern" once again proves that all true proletarian revolutionary art works are born in the fierce struggle between the two classes, the two lines, and the two roads, and have gone through a tough struggle with the class enemy and conservative forces. Revolutionary model operas of Peking opera, ballet, and symphonic music are like this, and the piano accompaniment for "The Red Lantern" is also like this. Here, we cannot help but recall the scene of our beloved Comrade Jiang Qing, who held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, leading revolutionary art workers to overcome countless storms and reefs, and experience countless dangers and shoals. It is under Comrade Jiang Qing's arduous and unyielding struggle and artistic practice that the fortresses of Peking opera, ballet, symphonic music, and piano art have been captured one by one, beginning to serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and to serve proletarian politics. Today, the eight revolutionary model operas in front of us are all shining pearls of Mao Zedong Thought. These brilliant pearls are all soaked with Comrade Jiang Qing's blood! Comrade Jiang Qing's spirit of firmly implementing and defending Chairman Mao's revolutionary line is forever our learning example! Forever inspiring us to forge ahead!

The proletarian revolutionary art warriors in the capital have achieved such results because they are infinitely loyal and steadfast to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, following closely and quickly; at the same time, they have gradually formed a strong revolutionary art force through the work of cleaning up the class ranks. We revolutionary factions on the Shanghai art front are determined to redouble our efforts, catch up quickly, and learn humbly from our comrades in the capital, following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, fully implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions, further mobilizing the masses, uniting all revolutionary forces, combining the great criticism with the cleaning up of the class ranks, and striking at a handful of class enemies steadily, accurately, and fiercely. In seizing new victories in revolution and production, we will continue to build new merits.

    欢呼毛主席革命文艺路线的新胜利
    于会咏
    当我们听到伟大领袖毛主席和他的亲密战友林副主席，观看和聆听了在江青同志培育和指导下所诞生的革命文艺新品种钢琴伴唱《红灯记》的喜讯，那种无比兴奋激动的心情，真是无法形容。顷刻间，我就同音乐界、京剧界一些革命战友们不约而同地汇合在一起了。共同的话题，共同的幸福感，使我们谈得异常热火。这是又一曲毛泽东思想胜利的凯歌，这是又一朵闪耀着毛泽东思想光辉的鲜花，这是又一颗强有力地射向阶级敌人的炮弹。让我们纵情欢呼：毛主席革命文艺路线胜利万岁！
    毛主席在给延安平剧院的信中说：“历史是人民创造的，但在旧戏舞台上（在一切离开人民的旧文学旧艺术上）人民却成了渣滓，由老爷太太少爷小姐们统治着舞台，这种历史的颠倒，现在由你们再颠倒过来，恢复了历史的面目”。在旧文艺舞台上，钢琴艺术同京剧、芭蕾舞、交响音乐一样，内容都是颠倒历史的。它们都是针插不入、水泼不进的顽固堡垒。象这样一种一向深居封建贵族、资产阶级的帝阙宫苑、华厅幽室的东西，如今居然登上了工农兵革命文艺舞台，这在过去是怎么也想象不到的。
    象这样一种一向被外国的、中国的老爷太太少爷小姐们吹捧为
  “音乐艺术皇冠上的明珠”，专门用以表达他们颓废、没落的思想感情，美化他们剥削、丑恶的生活，以至借出席“国际比赛”而大搞“和平竞赛”勾当的东西，如今居然成为抒发无产阶级豪情壮志，塑造无产阶级英雄形象的有力武器，这在过去也是想象不到的。
    象这样一种西洋的古老的乐器，居然和中国的古老的京剧音乐（唱腔和打击乐）有机地非常协调地结合成一体，有力地宣传毛泽东思想，这在过去更是想象不到的。
    钢琴伴唱《红灯记》创作和演出的成功，使我们再一次看到战无不胜的毛泽东思想的无比威力。只有坚决贯彻毛主席的“古为今用，洋为中用”，“破字当头，立也就在其中了”的教导，才能出现这样的奇迹。只有经过毛主席亲自发动的无产阶级文化大革命，才能得到这样的收获。只有毛主席的革命路线，才能将这种一向被封、资、修所把持的工具，收归无产阶级和劳动人民所有，才能把这座顽固堡垒攻下来，才能把被颠倒了的历史再颠倒过来。让我们一千遍一万遍地高呼：战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！
    从钢琴伴唱《红灯记》中，我们看到了在毛泽东思想统帅下，钢琴艺术的巨大威力和它无限广阔的发展前途。它既善于表现各种戏剧气氛，又善于塑造各种人物形象。特别值得我们注意的是，它在塑造英雄形象上的成就。“听罢奶奶说红灯，言语不多道理深。”这两句的伴奏，就是很出色的例子。在这里，它显示出京剧“四大件”所没有的优点。这段音乐是表现铁梅由红灯引起的相应的想象活动。在这里，京剧“四大件”的伴奏，总使人感到剧中人想象的境域比较窄、比较近又比较浅，似乎剧中人想的只是眼面前的事；而钢琴的伴奏却使人感到剧中人想象的境域很宽、很远又很深，不但想到了眼面前的事，而且想到了以前的和以后的事。从铁梅的几个唱段的比较中（如：“我家的表叔”和“提起敌寇心肺炸”的比较），我们可以明显地看出这一英雄人物的思想、性格和气质的发展和成长过程。这些特点，对于革命京剧音乐创作，都是重要的启发。因此，这一品种的出现，不但对钢琴音乐革命有着重大意义，而且也对京剧革命起着巨大的促进作用。
      “战地黄花分外香。”钢琴伴唱《红灯记》这个新品种的诞生，又一次证实了这样一个道理：凡是真正的无产阶级革命文艺作品，都是在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的激烈斗争中诞生的，都走过一段同阶级敌人和保守势力进行艰苦斗争的历程。京剧、芭蕾舞、交响音乐的革命样板戏是如此，钢琴伴唱《红灯记》也是如此。在这里，使我们情不自禁地回想起敬爱的江青同志高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，率领革命文艺工作者战胜过多少恶风巨浪，经历过多少险滩暗礁的情景。就是在江青同志艰苦卓绝的斗争实践和艺术实践下，京剧、芭蕾舞、交响音乐以及钢琴艺术等顽固堡垒，一个个被攻克了，开始为工农兵服务，为无产阶级政治服务。今天，摆在我们面前的八个革命样板戏，都是一颗颗闪耀着毛泽东思想光辉的明珠。这些灿烂的明珠，颗颗都渗透着江青同志的心血！江青同志坚决贯彻和捍卫毛主席革命路线的战斗精神，永远是我们学习的榜样！永远激励着我们奋勇向前。
    首都的无产阶级革命文艺战士所以能取得这样的成绩，根本原因就是他们对于毛主席革命路线无限忠诚，无比坚定，跟的紧，跟的快；同时又由于他们通过清理阶级队伍工作，逐渐形成了一支坚强的革命文艺队伍。我们上海文艺战线的无产阶级革命派，决心大鼓干劲，急起直追，虚心向首都的战友们学习，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，全面落实毛主席的最新指示，进一步放手发动群众，团结一切革命力量，把大批判和清理阶级队伍的工作结合起来，稳、准、狠地打击一小撮阶级敌人，在夺取革命和生产的新胜利中不断建立新功。
