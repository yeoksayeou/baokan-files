"The Voice of the Thai People" radio station broadcast an article on the 10th, celebrating the Thai people's armed forces, under the leadership of the Thai Communist Party, mastering and applying Chairman Mao's brilliant theory of people's war, growing stronger in battle.

The article said, the U.S.-Thai reactionaries are extremely fearful of the rapid development of the Thai people's revolutionary armed struggle. They attempt to use strengthened military "encirclement and suppression" to extinguish the revolutionary flames of the Thai people. Since the beginning of this year, the U.S.-Thanom clique has mobilized large numbers of armed military and police to brutally suppress the people's armed forces in various places. However, the enemy's savage suppression cannot stop the development of the people's armed struggle. The people and people's armed forces in the northeastern, northern, and southern parts of Thailand have bravely fought back against the enemy, smashed the enemy's counter-revolutionary "encirclement and suppression," and continuously achieved new victories.

The article pointed out that the Thai people's armed forces are growing stronger in battle and repeatedly smashing the U.S.-Thanom clique's counter-revolutionary "encirclement and suppression," achieving continuous victories, all because the Thai people's armed forces are under the leadership of the Thai Communist Party, which adheres to Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. This armed force responds resolutely to the call of the Thai Communist Party, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, striving to learn and apply Chairman Mao's theory of people's war, and combining this theory with local actual conditions to guide their struggle.

The article said, the people's armed forces have used Chairman Mao's guerrilla warfare tactics of "the enemy advances, we retreat; the enemy camps, we harass; the enemy tires, we attack; the enemy retreats, we pursue," seizing the initiative in battle and continuously achieving victories of annihilating the enemy.

The article said, the Thai people's armed forces, following the teachings of Chairman Mao Zedong that "revolutionary war is the war of the masses; only by mobilizing the masses can war be waged, only by relying on the masses can war be waged," have from the very beginning paid attention to mass work. They organized small teams to go deep into the countryside, conducting propaganda and mobilization among the peasants, raising the political awareness of the broad peasantry, and making them recognize the crimes of U.S. imperialism's aggression and plunder of Thailand and the Thanom-Praphat clique's harm to the country and the people. The people's armed forces also actively organized and led the peasants to punish traitors, oppose evil landlords and secret agents, and were warmly welcomed and supported by the broad masses.

The article said, the soldiers of the people's armed forces have a high level of political awareness. They come together not for the private interests of any small clique but for the interests of the broadest masses of the people. Therefore, this armed force is the bravest, most intelligent, most resourceful, and most powerful in battle. At the beginning of this year, a soldier of the people's armed forces in the northern province of Nan, in a situation where he was surrounded by the enemy on all sides, fearlessly, calmly, bravely, and resourcefully used the advantageous terrain to engage with the enemy, achieving the outstanding result of annihilating ten enemies.

The article pointed out that because the people's armed forces fully mobilize the masses, firmly rely on the masses, and blend in with the masses, they receive the strong support and sincere care of the masses. Therefore, they are well-informed, always take the initiative, and display the powerful might of people's war, making the enemy unable to defend against it and putting the enemy in a passive position of being beaten.

The article finally pointed out that the Thai people's armed forces are advancing with great strides. Although they will still have to go through a difficult and tortuous road, under the correct leadership of the Thai Communist Party, the Thai people's armed forces will definitely achieve ultimate victory.

    “泰国人民之声”号召掌握和运用毛主席人民战争理论指导斗争
    泰共领导的人民武装在战斗中成长壮大
    人民武装充分动员群众，依靠群众，得到群众大力支持和衷心爱护
    新华社十二日讯　“泰国人民之声”电台十日广播一篇文章，欢呼泰国人民武装在泰国共产党领导下，掌握和运用毛主席关于人民战争的光辉理论，在战斗中不断成长壮大。
    文章说，美泰反动派对泰国人民革命武装斗争的迅速发展，非常害怕。它们企图以加强武力“围剿”来扑灭泰国人民的革命烈火。今年以来，美国—他侬集团出动大批武装军警，疯狂镇压各地人民武装。但是，敌人的野蛮镇压，无法阻挡人民武装斗争的发展。泰国东北部、北部和南部的人民和人民武装英勇地痛击敌人，粉碎敌人的反革命“围剿”，不断取得新的胜利。
    文章指出，泰国人民武装所以越战越强，并且一次又一次地粉碎美国—他侬集团的反革命“围剿”，不断取得胜利，是由于泰国人民武装是在坚持马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的泰国共产党领导下的人民军队。这支人民武装队伍，坚决响应泰国共产党的号召，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，努力学习和运用毛主席关于人民战争的理论，并把这个理论同当地的实际情况相结合，指导自己的斗争。
    文章说，人民武装运用了毛主席制定的“敌进我退，敌驻我扰，敌疲我打，敌退我追”这一游击战战术，掌握战斗的主动权，不断取得歼灭敌人的胜利。
    文章说，泰国人民武装遵照毛泽东主席关于“革命战争是群众的战争，只有动员群众才能进行战争，只有依靠群众才能进行战争”的教导，从一开始就注意做群众工作。他们组织小分队深入农村，向农民进行宣传动员，使广大农民提高了政治觉悟，认识到美帝国主义侵略掠夺泰国和他侬—巴博集团祸国殃民的罪行。人民武装还积极组织和领导农民惩处卖国贼，反对恶霸地主和暗探特务，受到广大群众的热烈欢迎和支持。
    文章说，人民武装的战士有高度的政治觉悟，他们走到一起来，不是为任何一个小集团的私利，而是为着最广大人民群众的利益。因此，这支人民武装队伍，打起仗来最勇敢，最聪明，最机智，最有力量。今年年初，北部难府人民武装的一个战士，在被敌人四面围困的情况下，他无所畏惧，沉着、勇敢、机智地利用有利的地形，同敌人周旋，取得了歼敌十名的出色战果。
    文章指出，由于人民武装充分动员群众，坚决依靠群众，和群众打成一片，得到群众的大力支持和衷心爱护，所以耳目灵通，处处主动，发挥了人民战争的强大威力，使敌人防不胜防，处于被动挨打地位。
    文章最后指出，泰国人民武装正在高歌猛进。尽管还要经历艰苦、曲折的道路，但是，在泰国共产党的正确领导下，泰国人民武装一定能够取得最后胜利。
