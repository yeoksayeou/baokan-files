The Revolutionary Committee of Harbin Sunrise Store is holding high the banner of revolutionary criticism under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought. They lead the revolutionary staff to closely connect with the actual class struggle and the struggle between the two lines within the unit. They focus on the fundamental issue of which direction and path the socialist commerce should adhere to and follow. They are conducting a thorough criticism of the counter-revolutionary revisionist line promoted by the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents on the commercial front, making the entire store vibrant with a revolutionary new atmosphere.

The Sunrise Store was originally called "Qiu Lin Company." For a long time, there has been a fierce struggle between the socialist and capitalist paths here. A handful of capitalist roaders within the party have been vigorously promoting the revisionist goods of "business first," "technology first," "bonus as the commander," and "profit as the commander." They want the store's staff to learn from the capitalists, to master the bourgeois "business tactics," and to attempt to lead the socialist commerce onto the capitalist path. During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the broad revolutionary staff of the store, holding high the banner of "it is reasonable to rebel against the reactionaries," rebelled against the handful of capitalist roaders within the party, seizing back the leadership of the store.

After the establishment of the Revolutionary Committee, the revolutionary staff conducted a revolutionary criticism of the counter-revolutionary revisionist line promoted by the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents. Under the leadership of the Revolutionary Committee, they also organized Mao Zedong Thought study classes, inviting old workers, old poor peasants, and old Red Army soldiers to give reports and conduct class education. At the same time, they formed seven social investigation teams, going out of the store to visit factories, villages, offices, schools, military units, and neighborhoods, widely soliciting the opinions of the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers on the store's management direction. The development of these activities greatly enhanced the revolutionary staff's understanding of the class struggle and the struggle between the two lines on the commercial front, promoting the arrival of a new high tide of revolutionary criticism and struggle, criticism, and reform.

In conducting revolutionary criticism, the Revolutionary Committee of this store pays attention to guiding the revolutionary staff to firmly grasp the fundamental issue of adhering to which direction and following which path. Chairman Mao teaches us: "Developing the economy and ensuring supply is the general policy of our economic work and financial work." However, the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents advocate serving "all consumers." They engage in evil activities to restore capitalism, proposing a capitalist management policy of focusing on high-end products. The broad revolutionary staff angrily exposed and criticized the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents for altering the socialist commercial management direction. In 1958, the revolutionary staff of this store, inspired by the great leap forward mass movement, added more than a thousand kinds of mass-oriented products needed by the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers in the store, placing items such as cotton cloth, cotton, and cloth-made clothing on the counters that were previously not sold. However, soon after, they were ordered to be removed by a handful of capitalist roaders within the original provincial and municipal committees, who said they wanted to maintain the "Qiu Lin style" and "civilized operation." The actions of the handful of capitalist roaders within the original provincial and municipal committees were praised by the Chinese Khrushchev. In 1964, the Chinese Khrushchev came to Harbin and sent his wife to specially visit "Qiu Lin." This bourgeois element highly praised the so-called "Qiu Lin style" and finally asked the store's tailor to choose high-quality fabric to make her a cheongsam. Through exposure and criticism, the revolutionary staff's deep hatred for the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents was aroused. The revolutionary staff of this store also combined revolutionary criticism with the cleanup of class ranks, exposing the traitors, spies, and bad elements hidden in the store who sabotaged the socialist economy.

"The old must be destroyed before the new can be established." The Revolutionary Committee of this store fully mobilized the masses, relied on the masses, and closely combined revolutionary criticism with the struggle, criticism, and reform of the unit. They smashed the capitalist management direction and established the socialist management direction, making the store's appearance completely new. Now, the store's staff actively learn and apply Mao Zedong Thought, and all eight business groups have set up Mao Zedong Thought evening study classes. The revolutionary staff also turn the counters into platforms for propagating Mao Zedong Thought, often propagating Mao Zedong Thought to customers. The Revolutionary Committee guides the revolutionary staff to combine the struggle against self with the criticism of revisionism, achieving the revolutionization of people's thoughts. The revolutionary staff, following Chairman Mao's teachings, enthusiastically serve the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, and are praised by the masses.

    哈尔滨太阳升商店革委会狠抓革命大批判
    大破资本主义的经营方向
    大立社会主义的经营方向
    新华社哈尔滨二十一日电　哈尔滨太阳升商店革命委员会高举毛泽东思想的革命批判大旗，带领革命职工紧密联系本单位阶级斗争和两条路线斗争的实际，抓住社会主义商业坚持什么方向、走什么道路这个根本问题，大揭大批中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人在商业战线上推行的反革命修正主义路线，使整个商店呈现一派生气勃勃的革命新景象。
    太阳升商店原叫“秋林公司”。这里，长期以来存在着社会主义和资本主义两条道路的激烈斗争。党内一小撮走资派竭力推行“业务第一”、“技术第一”、“奖金挂帅”、“利润挂帅”等修正主义黑货，要商店的职工向资本家学习，学好资产阶级的那一套“生意经”，妄图把社会主义商业引向资本主义邪路。在无产阶级文化大革命中，商店的广大革命职工，高举“对反动派造反有理”的大旗，造了党内一小撮走资派的反，夺回了商店的领导大权。
    商店革命委员会成立以后，革命职工对中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人推行的反革命修正主义路线展开了革命大批判。在革委会领导下，他们还举办了毛泽东思想学习班，请老工人、老贫农、老红军作报告，进行阶级教育。同时，组成七个社会调查小组，走出商店，深入工厂、农村、机关、学校、部队和街道，广泛征求广大工农兵群众对商店经营方向的意见。这些活动的开展，大大提高了革命职工对商业战线上的阶级斗争和两条路线斗争的认识，促进了革命大批判和斗、批、改新高潮的到来。
    这个商店的革命委员会在开展革命大批判中，注意引导革命职工狠狠抓住坚持什么方向、走什么道路这个根本问题。毛主席教导我们：“发展经济，保障供给，是我们的经济工作和财政工作的总方针。”而中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人却鼓吹什么“为一切消费者服务”。他们大搞复辟资本主义的罪恶活动，提出以高档商品为主的资本主义经营方针。广大革命职工愤怒地揭发和批判了中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人篡改社会主义商业经营方向的罪行。一九五八年，这个商店的革命职工在大跃进伟大群众运动的鼓舞下，在商店里增加了上千种为广大工农兵群众所需要的大众化商品，把过去从不经营的棉布、棉花、布制服装等商品摆上了柜台。但是，不久就被原省委、市委内的一小撮走资派下令砍掉了，他们说什么要保持“秋林风格”、“文明经营”。原省委、市委内一小撮走资派的做法，得到了中国赫鲁晓夫的赏识。一九六四年，中国赫鲁晓夫来到哈尔滨，派他的老婆专门到“秋林”去参观。这个资产阶级分子对所谓“秋林风格”大加赞扬，最后还要这个商店的裁缝选择上等呢料为她制作旗袍。通过揭发和批判，激起了革命职工对中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人的深仇大恨。这个商店的革命职工还把革命大批判和清理阶级队伍结合起来，挖出了隐藏在商店里的叛徒、特务和破坏社会主义经济的坏人。
      “不破不立。”这个商店的革命委员会，充分发动群众，依靠群众，把革命大批判和本单位的斗、批、改紧密结合起来。他们大破资本主义的经营方向，大立社会主义的经营方向，使商店面貌焕然一新。现在，这个商店活学活用毛泽东思想已蔚然成风，八个营业组全部办起了毛泽东思想业余学习班。革命职工还把柜台变成宣传毛泽东思想的阵地，经常向顾客宣传毛泽东思想。革命委员会引导革命职工把斗私和批修结合起来，实现人的思想革命化。革命职工遵照毛主席的教导，热情地为广大工农兵群众服务，受到群众称赞。
