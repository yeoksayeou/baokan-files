The revolutionary committee of Mucity Gully Coal Mine has been relentlessly focusing on the revolutionary criticism and denunciation. It has timely exposed and smashed the plots of a small number of class enemies, resisted bourgeois ideology from all sides, and strengthened and developed the revolutionary committee in the midst of class struggle, thus powerfully promoting the revolution and production of the entire mine.

New China News Agency, July 7th: The revolutionary committee of Mucity Gully Coal Mine in Beijing Coal Administration, while leading the entire mine in carrying out revolutionary criticism and denunciation, has taken the lead in conducting revolutionary criticism and denunciation. By doing so, the revolutionary committee has not only promoted the thought revolutionization of its members but has also strongly promoted the revolutionary and production development of the entire mine, making the revolutionary committee continuously strengthened and developed in the midst of class struggle.

Since the establishment of the revolutionary committee in November last year, the mine has never stopped its revolutionary criticism and denunciation. Under the leadership of the revolutionary committee, the revolutionary workers of the entire mine have always directed their struggle against the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents, a small number of class enemies. The revolutionary criticism and denunciation has deepened step by step, and the level of criticism has also been continuously improved. The revolutionary criticism and denunciation has further promoted the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, promoted the thought revolutionization of people, and thus enabled coal production to continuously achieve high-yield records. Following the full completion of the state plan last year, the mine has again completed the first half-year's original coal production and excavation plans ahead of schedule by 10 days and 23 days, respectively, this year.

As soon as the revolutionary committee was established, it took the lead in focusing on revolutionary criticism and denunciation. The committee members often hold criticism meetings together or separately, and they have never stopped for seven months. When they hold criticism meetings, they often invite part of the masses to participate or go to the lower levels to conduct criticism and denunciation with a certain class or workshop. They combine revolutionary criticism and denunciation with the implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions and the combat tasks of the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, with the completion of each item of work determined by the revolutionary committee for struggle, criticism, and reform, and with the thought construction and organizational construction of the revolutionary committee as well as the thought revolutionization of each committee member. For the entire set of counter-revolutionary revisionist goods advocated by Chinese Khrushchev, they adopt the practice of concentrating time for systematic criticism, repeatedly criticizing key issues, timely criticizing active thoughts, and regularly criticizing in conjunction with tasks. As a result, the revolutionary committee has always maintained a vigorous and combative state, resisted bourgeois ideology from all sides, and timely exposed and smashed the plots of a small number of class enemies, making the revolutionary committee continuously strengthened and developed in the revolutionary criticism and denunciation.

After the establishment of the revolutionary committee of Mucity Gully Coal Mine, there were many problems to be solved, from politics to production, from living conditions to family disputes, it was truly a multitude of issues. At this time, some committee members were ready to sit down and solve some practical problems for the masses. With the help of the People's Liberation Army stationed in the mine, the revolutionary committee addressed this issue by starting with the revolutionary criticism and denunciation and firmly grasping the study and application of Mao Zedong Thought. The committee members held a criticism meeting, severely criticizing the Chinese Khrushchev and the mine's capitalist roaders for opposing Mao Zedong Thought and sabotaging the masses' study and application of Chairman Mao's works. The more they criticized, the more they hated the Chinese Khrushchev and the mine's capitalist roaders; the more they criticized, the closer they felt to Chairman Mao; the more they criticized, the clearer they understood that the soul of the revolutionary committee is Mao Zedong Thought. In the revolutionary criticism and denunciation, the revolutionary committee took the lead in establishing and consolidating the system of studying Chairman Mao's works throughout the mine: daily reading without interruption, studying before and after shifts without interruption, collective study at regular times every week without interruption, conducting Mao Zedong Thought study classes without interruption, and reporting to Chairman Mao every day without interruption. They also led the revolutionary workers of the entire mine to take "fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism" as the key, and "The Three Articles" as compulsory courses, to thoroughly criticize selfishness and establish public-mindedness, and to launch a mass movement of studying and applying "The Three Articles," criticizing selfishness and establishing public-mindedness, and reforming worldviews. Because the revolutionary committee grasped the root of the problem, some of the so-called old difficult problems were easily solved, and the work of the revolutionary committee changed from passive to active.

"The entire transitional period is characterized by class contradictions, the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, and the struggle between the two roads of socialism and capitalism. Forgetting this fundamental theory and practice of our party for more than ten years will lead one astray."

The revolutionary committee of Mucity Gully Coal Mine followed Chairman Mao's great teachings, conducted a thorough exposure and criticism of the "theory of the extinction of class struggle" advocated by the Chinese Khrushchev, and thus further raised the awareness of class struggle and line struggle among the committee members. They realized in the struggle practice that the revolutionary committee must never forget class struggle and revolutionary criticism and denunciation, and must never deviate from Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. In April this year, the great leader Chairman Mao once again pointed out with great wisdom: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is, in essence, a great political revolution under the condition of socialism, led by the Communist Party of China and the broad revolutionary masses it leads, against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes, and a continuation of the long-term struggle between the Communist Party of China and the Kuomintang reactionaries. It is a continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie." Chairman Mao's latest instructions further armed all the members of the revolutionary committee. To fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, they formulated a work plan to firmly grasp class struggle and clean up the class ranks. According to this plan, the revolutionary committee first took the lead in criticizing the capitalist roaders' counter-revolutionary revisionist organizational line of forming factions and surrendering to the enemy. At the same time, they discussed the new characteristics of class struggle, exposed the various manifestations of class struggle, and mobilized the masses to further expose the cover of class struggle, combining revolutionary criticism and denunciation with the cleaning up of class ranks. They exposed one by one the class enemies who had been hiding for a long time, greatly boosting the morale of the revolutionary masses and greatly demoralizing the class enemies, further developing the good situation of revolution and production.

When the revolutionary committee of Mucity Gully Coal Mine carried out revolutionary criticism and denunciation, they often combined it with the active thoughts of the committee members, criticizing revisionism and fighting selfishness. Their practice was to bring an active thought, study a segment of Chairman Mao's relevant instructions, criticize a fallacy of the Chinese Khrushchev, and solve a problem. When the revolutionary committee was first established, many committee members had a clear understanding of caring for the masses and connecting with the masses. They gave the office building to the workers as a dormitory, set up the office in a simple house, and had fewer staff. However, as time went on and work became busy, they relaxed their thought revolutionization, and the "self" began to rise. The number of staff increased, and some committee members did not do enough to go deep into the masses. In response to these active thoughts, the revolutionary committee organized all committee members to study Chairman Mao's latest instructions: "The revolutionary committee should implement unified leadership, break down the overlapping administrative organs, streamline the organization, and organize a revolutionary leadership team that is connected with the masses." They also severely criticized the mine's capitalist roaders for promoting overlapping bureaucratic organizations and acting like officials. In the process of criticism, many committee members recognized from the capitalist roaders, this negative example, that the tendency to detach from the masses was very dangerous. Many committee members actively fought selfishness and criticized revisionism, criticized the thought of "being an official," and resisted the infiltration of bureaucratism, better establishing the thought of serving the people and being an ordinary soldier. On the basis of unifying thoughts, the revolutionary committee streamlined the staff, adjusted the office organization, and formulated a system where, except for leaving two standing committee members on duty every week, the rest would all go deep into the mine and workshops. They chose the places where class struggle was the most acute, the most complex, and where there were the most problems, to go there with the revolutionary workers to study and apply Chairman Mao's works together, to carry out revolutionary criticism and denunciation together, and to participate in labor together. In this way, the committee members were better placed under the supervision of the masses, not detached from the masses, and were able to maintain close and frequent contact with the masses.

    把中国赫鲁晓夫等党内一小撮走资派批深批透批倒批臭
    木城涧煤矿革委会抓住革命大批判不放
    及时识破和粉碎了一小撮阶级敌人的阴谋破坏活动，抵制了来自各方面的资产阶级思想影响，使革委会在阶级斗争的风浪中不断巩固发展，有力地推动了全矿的革命和生产
    新华社七日讯　北京矿务局木城涧煤矿革命委员会在领导全矿开展革命大批判的同时，以身作则，带头开展革命大批判。木城涧煤矿革委会这样做，不但促进了革委会成员自身的思想革命化，又强有力地推动了全矿革命和生产的蓬勃发展，使革委会在阶级斗争的风浪中得到不断的巩固和发展。
    这个矿从去年十一月成立革命委员会以来，革命的大批判始终没有中断过。全矿革命职工在革委会的带领下，始终把斗争矛头紧紧对准中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人等一小撮阶级敌人。革命大批判步步深入，批判的水平也越来越高。革命的大批判进一步推动了全矿活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动，促进了人的思想革命化，从而使煤炭生产不断出现高产纪录。继去年全面超额完成国家计划之后，今年全矿又分别提前十一天和二十三天超额完成了上半年的原煤生产和掘进计划。
    这个矿的革命委员会刚一成立，就以身作则地抓住革命的大批判不放。革命委员会的委员们，经常在一起或分口召开批判会，七个月来从未中断。他们开批判会时，常常吸收一部分群众参加，或者到下边和某一班组、车间的群众一道进行。他们把革命大批判同落实毛主席最新指示和执行以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的战斗任务结合起来，同完成革委会研究确定的斗批改的每一项工作结合起来，同革委会的思想建设和组织建设以及每个委员的思想革命化结合起来。对于中国赫鲁晓夫所鼓吹的一整套反革命修正主义黑货，他们采取了集中时间系统地批，重点问题反复地批，针对活思想及时地批，结合任务经常地批的做法。这样做的结果，使革命委员会始终保持了朝气勃勃的战斗状态，抵制了来自各方面的资产阶级思想的影响，并且及时识破和粉碎了一小撮阶级敌人的阴谋破坏活动，使革命委员会在革命大批判中不断得到巩固和发展。
    木城涧煤矿革命委员会成立后，有许多问题急待解决，从政治到生产，从生活福利到家庭纠纷，真是千头万绪，纷至沓来。这时，有的委员就准备坐下来为群众解决些实际问题。在驻矿人民解放军的帮助下，革委会针对这个问题，从开展革命大批判入手，狠抓活学活用毛泽东思想。革委会委员在一起召开了批判会，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫及矿上的走资派反对毛泽东思想，破坏群众活学活用毛主席著作的滔天罪行。越批判，对中国赫鲁晓夫及矿上的走资派越仇恨；越批判，对毛主席越亲；越批判，越明确了革委会的灵魂就是毛泽东思想。在革命大批判中，革委会以身作则，在全矿建立和巩固了毛主席著作学习制度：天天读雷打不动，班前班后学雷打不动，每周规定时间集体学习雷打不动，办毛泽东思想学习班雷打不动，每天向毛主席请示汇报雷打不动。他们还带领全矿革命职工以“斗私，批修”为纲，以“老三篇”为必修课，在灵魂深处大破私字，大立公字，掀起了活学活用“老三篇”，破私立公，改造世界观的群众性热潮。由于革委会抓住了根本，过去的一些所谓老大难问题迎刃而解，革委会的工作由被动完全转为主动。
      “整个过渡时期存在着阶级矛盾、存在着无产阶级和资产阶级的阶级斗争、存在着社会主义和资本主义的两条道路斗争。忘记十几年来我党的这一条基本理论和基本实践，就会要走到斜路上去。”
    木城涧煤矿革委会遵循毛主席的这一伟大教导，对中国赫鲁晓夫鼓吹的“阶级斗争熄灭”论进行了大揭发大批判，从而进一步提高了革委会成员们的阶级斗争和路线斗争觉悟。他们在斗争实践中体会到，革委会什么时候也不能忘记阶级斗争和革命大批判，什么时候也不能离开毛主席的革命路线。今年四月，伟大领袖毛主席又一次极其英明地指出：“无产阶级文化大革命，实质上是在社会主义条件下，无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命，是中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续，是无产阶级和资产阶级阶级斗争的继续。”毛主席的最新指示，进一步武装了革委会的全体成员。他们为了全面落实毛主席的最新指示，制定了狠抓阶级斗争、清理阶级队伍的工作计划。根据这一计划，革委会首先带头批判了走资派结党营私、招降纳叛的反革命修正主义组织路线。同时，他们通过大议阶级斗争的新特点，大摆阶级斗争的种种表现，发动群众进一步大揭阶级斗争的盖子，使革命大批判同清理阶级队伍结合起来，把一小撮隐藏很久很深的阶级敌人一个个揪了出来，大长了无产阶级革命派的志气，大灭了阶级敌人的威风，进一步发展了革命和生产的大好形势。
    木城涧煤矿革命委员会在开展革命大批判的时候，经常结合委员们的活思想，把批修和斗私结合起来。他们的做法是，带着一种活思想，学习一段毛主席的有关指示，批判中国赫鲁晓夫一个谬论，解决一个问题。革委会刚刚成立的时候，许多委员关心群众和联系群众的思想比较明确，他们把办公大楼让给工人当作宿舍，办公室设在简陋的平房里，办事人员也少。但是时间一久，工作一忙，放松了思想革命化，“私”字有了抬头，办事人员越来越多，有些委员深入群众也做得不够了。针对这些活思想，革委会就组织全体委员学习了毛主席“革命委员会要实行一元化的领导，打破重叠的行政机构，精兵简政，组织起一个革命化的联系群众的领导班子”的最新指示，并且狠批了矿上走资派大搞重叠的官僚主义机构、当官做老爷的罪行。在批判的过程中，许多委员从走资派这个反面教员身上，认识到自己脱离群众的苗头是非常危险的。许多委员主动斗私批修，批判“当官”的思想，击退了官僚主义的侵袭，更好地树立了为人民服务、当普通一兵的思想。在统一思想的基础上，革委会精简了办事人员，调整了办事机构，并且订出了每周除留两名常委值班外，其余一律深入到井下和车间的制度。他们选择阶级斗争最尖锐、最复杂和问题最多的地方，到那里去同革命职工一起活学活用毛主席著作，一起搞革命大批判，一起参加劳动。这样就使革委会成员更好地置于群众的监督之下，不脱离群众，并且能和群众保持密切的、经常的联系。
