For the glorious victory of the Vietnamese military and people in shooting down 3,000 U.S. aircraft, Ambassador Vu Minh Quan of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam held a press conference in Beijing today.

In his speech, Ambassador Vu Minh Quan pointed out that under the blows of the heroic Vietnamese military and people, the myth of the U.S. imperialists' so-called "air superiority" has been shattered. The failure of U.S. imperialism is now undeniable, but it has not yet abandoned its ambition to invade Vietnam. The Vietnamese military and people will continue to strike hard and shoot down more U.S. aircraft.

The ambassador pointed out that the victory of shooting down 3,000 U.S. aircraft by the Vietnamese military and people is the result of their unleashing the power of people's war, a victory of the Vietnamese people's resolve to fight to the end, and a victory of the combat unity between the people of North and South Vietnam. He said that the Vietnamese people, responding to the call of Chairman Ho Chi Minh, with an ironclad determination to defeat the U.S. aggressors, will press on, overcome all difficulties, and strive for greater victories, ultimately achieving the final victory. Ambassador Vu Minh Quan said, taking this opportunity, I, on behalf of the Vietnamese Labor Party, government, and people, would like to express our sincere gratitude to the beloved Chairman Mao, the Communist Party of China, the Chinese government, and the brotherly Chinese people for their enthusiastic support and tremendous, precious, and effective aid to the Vietnamese people.
