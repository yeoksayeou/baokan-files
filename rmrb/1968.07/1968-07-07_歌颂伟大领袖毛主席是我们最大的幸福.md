The loudest song is "The East is Red," and the greatest leader is Mao Zedong. Using colorful brushes to depict the sublime image of the great leader Chairman Mao, using artworks to propagate the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, and using splendid scrolls to sing the praises of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, is the greatest wish and most urgent need of the hundreds of millions of workers, peasants, and soldiers, and the Red Guards. It is also the fundamental task and most glorious duty of us revolutionary art workers.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "In the present world, all culture or literature and art belong to a certain class and a certain political line." He also teaches us: "If you are a bourgeois artist, you will not sing the praises of the proletariat but of the bourgeoisie; if you are a proletarian artist, you will not sing the praises of the bourgeoisie but of the proletariat and the laboring people: one of the two must be chosen." For a long time, the art world, like the entire literary and art world, has been dominated by a line that is opposed to Mao Zedong Thought. Under the protection and support of the Chinese Khrushchev, a small group of counter-revolutionary revisionists and bourgeois reactionary academic authorities, led by Cai Ruohong and Hua Junwu, have controlled the art world. They fiercely resist Chairman Mao's revolutionary literary and art line. They do not paint for the workers, peasants, and soldiers but serve the bourgeoisie; they do not serve proletarian politics but create public opinion for the Chinese Khrushchev to restore capitalism in our country. In art academies, they poison young people with feudal and capitalist decadent artistic ideas, advocating that "art is not serious, it only requires novelty," and promoting various formalist schools, openly creating anti-party, anti-socialist, and anti-Mao Zedong Thought black paintings. On the other hand, they use various rules and regulations to restrict students of worker and peasant origin, suppress and attack new forces loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary literary and art line, and do not allow us to truly go among the workers, peasants, and soldiers, nor allow us to create works praising Chairman Mao. A thunderous spring thunder roared. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao, began. As Chairman Mao's Red Guards, we broke through countless obstacles and came out. We launched a great struggle against the capitalist roaders within the party and the counter-revolutionary revisionist literary and art black line.

In the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, Chairman Mao received us Red Guards several times. Every time I saw Chairman Mao's tall figure, his benevolent face, and his smiling hand waving to us, my heart was filled with immense excitement, and I could not help but shout enthusiastically: "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live Chairman Mao! Long live Chairman Mao ten thousand times!" At that moment, I wanted so much to depict with my brush the red sun in our hearts! In the past, a small group of counter-revolutionary revisionists not only did not depict the glorious image of the great leader Chairman Mao but also used various excuses to prevent us from praising the great leader Chairman Mao. Today, we will brandish our brushes and sing enthusiastically about the red sun in our hearts. My comrades and I rushed out of the school gates, went to the streets, and vigorously propagated Mao Zedong Thought and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. We drew many portraits of Chairman Mao and propaganda posters on street billboards, which were warmly welcomed by the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, and the Red Guards. To follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, we often worked day and night, sometimes lying down to rest when tired, and then continuing to draw when we woke up. What we drew the most was the glorious image of Chairman Mao. Every time a propaganda poster was completed, passersby often gathered to watch, and in front of Chairman Mao's portrait, they shouted "Long live Chairman Mao." The broad masses' boundless love and reverence for Chairman Mao deeply educated me. Chairman Mao teaches us: "Our culture is the people's culture. Cultural workers must have a high degree of enthusiasm for serving the people and must be connected with the masses, not detached from the masses." The broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers' urgent desire to see the glorious image of the great leader Chairman Mao further inspired my sense of responsibility in creation. The masses' love for Chairman Mao's portraits inspired us to pick up our brushes to draw more and better.

Last July, the revolutionary masses of the capital, Jiangxi, and Anshan jointly organized the exhibition "The Splendor of Mao Zedong Thought Illuminates the Anshan Workers' Movement." We students from Beijing schools participated in the preparatory work. The task assigned to me was to paint an oil painting of Chairman Mao going to Anshan in the autumn of 1921. I study industrial art and have not learned oil painting before, so the difficulties were great. I was both excited and timid. But when I thought of Chairman Mao and the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers' desire to see Chairman Mao's glorious image, my courage grew. With loyalty to Chairman Mao, my determination and courage to overcome difficulties increased. The world has entered a new era with Mao Zedong Thought as the great banner. Singing the praises of the great leader is the urgent need of hundreds of millions of people. What difficulties can we not overcome? I am the son of a poor peasant. After liberation, I was able to go to college. This is the happiness that Chairman Mao brought us, and it is the laboring people who raised me with their blood and sweat. I will follow Chairman Mao's words, be a faithful spokesman for the masses, love what the masses love, and draw what the masses need, serving the people wholeheartedly.

To complete this glorious battle task, we went to Anshan, where Chairman Mao personally ignited the revolutionary flames, to visit and investigate. We felt extremely excited! Before going to Anshan, we studied Chairman Mao's relevant works and many historical materials about the Anshan workers' movement. After arriving in Anshan, through visiting old workers, we had a more concrete understanding of the historical facts of the Anshan workers' struggle. From 1921 to 1930, Chairman Mao traversed mountains and rivers and came to Anshan many times, leading the heroic Anshan workers in a magnificent revolutionary struggle. It was Chairman Mao who personally sowed the seeds of revolution in Anshan, educated the workers with Marxism-Leninism, and established party and league organizations. It was Chairman Mao who made the wise decision for the Anshan Great Strike, calling on workers to fight resolutely. It was Chairman Mao who personally deployed the Autumn Harvest Uprising that shocked the world, creating the first armed force of workers and peasants, marching towards Jinggangshan, and blazing a trail of surrounding the cities with the countryside and seizing political power with arms. Chairman Mao's great revolutionary practice in Anshan is an epic of unparalleled grandeur and splendor. We feel extremely honored and happy to be able to depict a fragment of this epic with our brushes! However, for a long time, the Chinese Khrushchev actually appropriated the credit for the Anshan workers' struggle led by Chairman Mao, saying it was his achievement. To build his own monument and realize his ambition to usurp the party and the country, he spared no effort to create black paintings, shoot films, and compile memoirs, turning a traitor and clown into a "leader" of the Anshan workers' struggle and a "hero." This is intolerable! The Chinese Khrushchev's heinous crimes in Anshan aroused our boundless hatred. We are Chairman Mao's Red Guards. We must turn the history that the Chinese Khrushchev has distorted back to its rightful place!

Chairman Mao teaches us: "To make literature and art a component of the entire revolutionary machine, as a powerful weapon for uniting the people, educating the people, attacking the enemy, and annihilating the enemy, helping the people to unite and fight against the enemy." With boundless love for Chairman Mao and boundless hatred for the Chinese Khrushchev, we began the creation of this oil painting. We are not just painting; we are fighting. We are defending Chairman Mao and safeguarding Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, exposing and striking the Chinese Khrushchev with great force!

The most important thing in creating the painting "Chairman Mao Goes to Anshan" is to depict the glorious image and great thoughts of our great leader Chairman Mao in his youth. Everything in the painting should serve to depict Chairman Mao's great thoughts. We extensively collected Chairman Mao's articles and poems from his youth, as well as reminiscences and historical materials related to Chairman Mao's revolutionary activities and Anshan. We repeatedly studied and discussed. To highlight Chairman Mao's glorious image, we arranged Chairman Mao's figure in the most prominent position in the composition. Chairman Mao's tall figure is coming towards us, like a dazzling sunrise bringing us endless hope. Chairman Mao's every move embodies the great Mao Zedong Thought. In terms of dynamics, we want every small movement of Chairman Mao to have a definite meaning: slightly raising his head and slightly turning his neck to express Chairman Mao's fearless and unyielding revolutionary spirit of daring to struggle and daring to win; tightly clenched left hand to show Chairman Mao's resolute, thorough, and decisive spirit, fearing no sacrifice, overcoming all difficulties, and having the great ambition and unshakable belief in winning the liberation of all of China and all of humanity; right hand holding an old umbrella, showing Chairman Mao's hardworking style of going through wind and rain for the revolution, traversing mountains and rivers, and tirelessly working; steady steps on the uneven road, indicating that Chairman Mao has blazed a trail for us, clearing the way for our victory; autumn wind blowing the long hair that has not been trimmed due to busy work, indicating that this is an extraordinary moment, the moment when the revolutionary storm is about to come. We see that with the rise of the red sun, the Anshan mountains see the red dawn, and with the arrival of the savior, Anshan sees the blue sky. In short, whether it is the mountains, the sky, the trees, or the clouds, they all have thoughts, forming artistic language, playing their due role in highlighting the glorious image of the red sun in our hearts. Take the layers of clouds in the painting, for example, "Chaotic clouds fly across, still composed," it not only indicates that Chairman Mao came to Anshan at a time of fierce class struggle, and at this time, Chairman Mao is so composed, calm, and determined, but it also foreshadows that Chairman Mao's arrival will bring a new storm of class struggle!

In the creation process, we found the most difficult and important thing was how to depict Chairman Mao's facial expressions. Due to the hardships of the past revolutionary struggles, there are few photos of Chairman Mao in his youth, making it difficult to refer to sufficiently; due to the fear of a small group of capitalist roaders within the party that Chairman Mao's glorious image would deeply impress the revolutionary masses, they controlled or did not publish photos of Chairman Mao in his youth; also due to the control of the counter-revolutionary revisionist literary and art black line, under the monopoly of those "authorities" and "experts," many artworks depicting Chairman Mao's glorious image were poorly made, even distorted, causing confusion among the revolutionary masses about Chairman Mao's glorious image in his youth. Under these circumstances, to successfully depict Chairman Mao's facial expressions, we must find an appropriate solution. The key to solving the problem is to grasp Mao Zedong Thought and use Mao Zedong Thought to guide the solution. Through repeated study and visits, we clarified that we must express through Chairman Mao's facial expressions Chairman Mao's vast revolutionary breast, expressing Chairman Mao's "pointing at the vast land, who controls the rise and fall," expressing Chairman Mao's heroic spirit of "in the prime of youth," "pointing at the rivers and mountains," expressing Chairman Mao's great ambition to liberate all of China and all of humanity, expressing Chairman Mao's fearless and unyielding revolutionary spirit of braving storms and waves. In short, we must express that the red sun in our hearts, the most brilliant and most outstanding leader in the world for several hundred years and in China for several thousand years. We found a few photos of Chairman Mao in his youth that we could find, copying them over and over again, striving to remember the age characteristics and image characteristics of Chairman Mao in his youth. We also collected photos of Chairman Mao from various periods up to the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, integrating all the images of Chairman Mao we have seen and thought of, and the glorious image of our great leader Chairman Mao in his youth became clearer and clearer in our hearts. At this time, we seemed to stand on the Anshan mountains in the early 20th century, under the oppressive clouds and bloody rain, seeing the Anshan workers suffering under the oppression of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, struggling in the depths of misery; we seemed to see the blazing flames of anger in their hearts; we seemed to hear their hearts longing for the savior to come soon; we seemed to see group after group of workers looking to the east, hoping for the red sun to rise in the east; we seemed to see lightning wrapped in thunder roaring, and strong winds and heavy rain howling, in this extraordinary "turbulent years," breaking through the clouds, a red sun bursting forth, our heart's reddest red sun rising on the Anshan mountains! We seemed to see the red sun rising over the mountains and rivers, and the mountains and rivers all bathed in the morning light, the savior coming to Anshan, and Anshan seeing the blue sky. Chairman Mao is coming towards us, coming towards the Anshan mountains. At this moment, my heart could not be calm, I could not eat or sleep, I had to pick up my brush and depict this scene! I put all the photos of Chairman Mao aside, picked up my brush, and imagined depicting the reddest red sun in my heart. I drew over and over again, drawing while asking old workers and comrades for their opinions. I wanted to concentrate the best impressions of Chairman Mao in the hearts of the revolutionary masses. Every time I picked up my brush, my heart could not be calm. We worked day and night, forgetting to sleep, drawing and drawing! We wanted to blend our love and affection for Chairman Mao with the oil paints on the canvas. Thinking of Chairman Mao's brilliant image illuminating the world, reciting Chairman Mao's majestic poems: "Just like young students, in the prime of youth; scholars' spirit, sweeping away the dust. Pointing at the rivers and mountains, stirring up the words, treating the former nobles of the world as dung." The more I drew, the more I felt full of strength. We sang and shouted enthusiastically, wishing our heart's reddest red sun, Chairman Mao, eternal life! Eternal life!

The foreign art form of oil painting has long been used to serve the bourgeoisie and is regarded as "high art." Its content is either landscapes, still life, or ghosts and monsters. The broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers do not like to watch it and do not understand it. They say: "It's piece by piece, we don't understand; it's pile by pile, it's ugly and uncomfortable." If ballet can be used to serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers, why can't oil painting serve them well? Chairman Mao instructs us to "use foreign things for Chinese purposes and use ancient things for modern purposes." Comrade Jiang Qing also encourages us to dare to create, not to be afraid of failure, and to strive for the unity of revolutionary content and as perfect artistic form as possible. Although I have not learned oil painting, I have learned some basic painting knowledge. According to the needs of the theme and the habits of the masses' appreciation, we utilized the rich expressive power of oil painting and the fine carving advantages of traditional Chinese painting, attempting to combine the characteristics of the two. In this process, we also encountered opposition from some so-called "experts" and "authorities": "Your painting lacks color," "It looks like a calendar painting, it's boring." Some shook their heads and walked away. However, the broad revolutionary masses gave enthusiastic affirmation, and some comrades who do oil painting enthusiastically helped me continue painting. Chairman Mao teaches us to create works with a "Chinese style and Chinese spirit" that the Chinese people like to see and hear. We are to strive to create this new form and new style. We are to take the requirements of workers, peasants, and soldiers as the standard, not the habits of those bourgeois experts and authorities. We have not learned oil painting and are not bound by old frameworks and foreign doctrines. We will use whatever means the workers, peasants, and soldiers like. The painting "Chairman Mao Goes to Anshan" is just our first attempt, and there are some problems that need to be further solved in the future. However, we firmly believe that with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, we can conquer all stubborn artistic fortresses!

The eight revolutionary model operas and the new art form of piano accompaniment "The Red Lantern" created under the personal cultivation of Comrade Jiang Qing, who shines with the splendor of Mao Zedong Thought, have given us great inspiration and education, encouraging us to strive for the creation of new proletarian literature and art. The oil painting "Chairman Mao Goes to Anshan" being able to meet with the people of the whole country is the result of Chairman Mao's brilliant thoughts and great revolutionary practice educating and inspiring us, the result of Comrade Jiang Qing's warm concern and enthusiastic support for us, and the result of the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, and the Red Guards enthusiastically helping us. We deeply understand that our creation is just the beginning. This painting still has some shortcomings and is far from meeting the requirements of Chairman Mao, the Party, and the people. The fighting mission entrusted to us by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution still requires us to continue to struggle unyieldingly. In the future, we will definitely hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, study Chairman Mao's works diligently, go among the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, and go into the great storms of class struggle to thoroughly reform ourselves. At the same time, we will humbly learn from revolutionary opera workers and music workers, taking Comrade Jiang Qing as our shining example, becoming lifelong red literature and art warriors who are loyal to the great leader Chairman Mao, loyal to the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, and loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers for life, and serving proletarian politics.

    歌颂伟大领袖毛主席是我们最大的幸福
    中央工艺美术学院学生　刘春华
    最响亮的歌是东方红，最伟大的领袖是毛泽东。用多彩的画笔描绘伟大领袖毛主席的崇高形象，用美术作品宣传战无不胜的毛泽东思想，用绚丽的画卷歌颂毛主席的革命路线，是亿万工农兵群众和红卫兵小将最大的心愿、最迫切的需要，也是我们革命美术工作者最根本的任务、最光荣的职责。
    毛主席教导我们：“在现在世界上，一切文化或文学艺术都是属于一定的阶级，属于一定的政治路线的。”又教导我们：“你是资产阶级文艺家，你就不歌颂无产阶级而歌颂资产阶级；你是无产阶级文艺家，你就不歌颂资产阶级而歌颂无产阶级和劳动人民：二者必居其一。”长期以来，美术界和整个文艺界一样，被一条与毛泽东思想相对立的反党反社会主义的黑线专了政。在中国赫鲁晓夫的包庇和支持下，以蔡若虹、华君武等为首的一小撮反革命修正主义分子、资产阶级反动学术权威把持着美术界的阵地，疯狂地抵制毛主席的革命文艺路线。他们不为工农兵画画，而为资产阶级效劳；不为无产阶级政治服务，而为中国赫鲁晓夫在我国复辟资本主义制造舆论。他们在美术院校中，一方面用封建主义和资本主义腐朽的艺术思想毒害青年，胡说什么“艺术没正经，只要求新鲜”，鼓吹什么“艺术作品要几十年后才能被人承认”等等，大搞大、洋、古，宣扬形式主义诸流派，公然创作反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的黑画。另一方面，他们用种种清规戒律，限制工农出身的同学，压制和打击忠于毛主席革命文艺路线的新生力量，不让我们真正地深入工农兵群众，不许我们创作歌颂毛主席的作品。一声春雷震天响。毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命运动开始后，我们作为毛主席的红卫兵，冲破了重重阻碍杀出来了，我们大造党内走资派的反，大造反革命修正主义文艺黑线的反。
    在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命运动中，毛主席多次接见了我们红卫兵。每当我看到毛主席那高大的身影，那慈祥的面孔，微笑着向我们招手时，我的心情万分激动，不禁纵情高呼：“毛主席万岁！毛主席万岁！毛主席万万岁！”当时，我多么想用画笔描绘出我们心中的红太阳呀！过去一小撮反革命修正主义分子，他们不仅不表现伟大的领袖毛主席的光辉形象，而且还用种种借口不让我们歌颂伟大领袖毛主席。今天，我们就要挥舞画笔，尽情讴歌我们心中的红太阳。我和战友们一起冲出校门，走上街头，大力宣传毛泽东思想，大力宣传毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。我们在街头的标语牌上绘制了许多毛主席的画像和宣传画，受到了广大工农兵群众和红卫兵小将的热烈欢迎。为了紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，我们经常夜以继日地画，有时累了就躺在地上睡一下，醒来又接着画。我们画得最多的就是毛主席的光辉形象。每当宣传画完成时，来往的群众经常聚拢来观看，面对着毛主席的画像高呼毛主席万岁。广大群众无限热爱、无限崇敬毛主席的感情，使我受到了深刻的教育。毛主席教导我们：“我们的文化是人民的文化，文化工作者必须有为人民服务的高度的热忱，必须联系群众，而不要脱离群众。”广大工农兵群众迫切要求看到伟大领袖毛主席光辉形象的心情，更进一步激发了我创作的责任感。群众那样热爱毛主席的画像，鼓舞着我们拿起画笔来更多地画，更好地画。
    去年七月，首都、江西和安源的无产阶级革命派联合筹办“毛泽东思想光辉照亮了安源工人运动”的展览，我们北京院校的同学参加了这项筹备工作。分配给我的任务是画一幅毛主席在一九二一年秋天去安源的油画。我是学工艺美术的，过去没有学过油画，困难是很大的，真是又激动，又胆怯。但是当我一想到毛主席，想到广大工农兵群众渴望看到毛主席的光辉形象的心情时，我的胆子就壮了。有了忠于毛主席的感情，就增加了克服困难的决心和勇气。世界进入了以毛泽东思想为伟大旗帜的新时代，歌颂伟大领袖是亿万人民群众迫切的需要，我们还有什么困难不能克服呢？我是个贫农的儿子，解放后，能够上大学，这是毛主席给我们带来的幸福，是劳动人民用血汗把我养大的，我要听毛主席的话，做群众忠实的代言人，爱群众之所爱，画群众之所需，全心全意为人民服务。
    为了完成这个光荣的战斗任务，我们到毛主席亲自点燃革命烈火的安源路矿去参观、访问，我们感到无比兴奋！在去安源以前，我们就学习了毛主席的有关著作和许多安源工人运动的史料。到安源以后，通过访问老工人，使我们更加具体地了解到安源工人斗争的史实。从一九二一年到一九三○年，毛主席跋山涉水，曾经多次来到安源，领导英雄的安源工人进行了轰轰烈烈的革命斗争。是毛主席亲手在安源撒下了革命的火种，向工人进行了马克思列宁主义教育，建立起党团组织。是毛主席亲自作出了安源大罢工的英明决策，号召工人进行坚决斗争。是毛主席在安源亲自部署了震惊世界的秋收暴动，创建第一支工农武装，奔向井冈山，开拓了以农村包围城市，武装夺取政权的光辉道路。毛主席在安源的伟大革命实践，是一部无比宏伟壮丽的史诗。我们能用画笔来表现这部史诗的一个片断，感到无比的光荣和幸福！可是，长期以来，中国赫鲁晓夫竟然贪天之功，把毛主席亲自领导的安源工人斗争，说成是他的功劳。他为了给自己树碑立传，妄图实现他篡党篡国的野心，不惜工本地绘制黑画，拍摄电影，炮制回忆录等等，硬把一个工贼和小丑，打扮成“领导”安源工人斗争的“英雄”。是可忍，孰不可忍！中国赫鲁晓夫在安源的滔天罪行，激起了我们无比的仇恨。我们是毛主席的红卫兵，我们一定要把中国赫鲁晓夫颠倒了的历史重新颠倒过来！
    毛主席教导我们：“要使文艺很好地成为整个革命机器的一个组成部分，作为团结人民、教育人民、打击敌人、消灭敌人的有力的武器，帮助人民同心同德地和敌人作斗争。”我们怀着对毛主席的无限热爱和对中国赫鲁晓夫的无比仇恨，开始了这幅油画的创作。我们不只是在画画，而是在战斗。是在保卫毛主席，捍卫毛主席的革命路线，是对中国赫鲁晓夫的有力的揭露，无情的打击！
    创作《毛主席去安源》这幅画，最最重要的是要表现我们伟大领袖毛主席青年时代的光辉形象和伟大的思想，画面上一切都应该为表现毛主席的伟大思想服务。我们广泛地搜集了毛主席青年时代的文章和诗词，以及有关毛主席革命活动的回忆录和安源的有关历史资料。反复进行了学习和讨论。为了集中突出毛主席的光辉形象，在构图上我们把毛主席的形象安排在最突出的地位。毛主席高大的形象迎着我们，向我们走来了，象一轮光彩夺目的朝阳从我们面前升起，给人带来了无限的希望。毛主席的一举一动，都体现着伟大的毛泽东思想。在动态处理上，要让毛主席的每一微小动作都有一定的含义：用稍稍扬起的头和稍稍扭转的颈部表情说明毛主席不畏艰险、不畏强暴、敢于斗争、敢于胜利的大无畏的革命精神；紧握的左手表现毛主席具有坚决、彻底、下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，为争取解放全中国全人类的雄心壮志和必定胜利的信念；右手挟着一把旧雨伞，说明毛主席风里来，雨里去，为革命不辞辛苦，跋山涉水，到处奔波的艰苦的工作作风；迈着稳健的步伐，踏在不平的路上，表明毛主席为我们披荆斩棘，踏平了我们前进的道路，引导我们胜利前进；秋风吹起了由于工作紧张而没有时间修整的长发；衣衫被风吹得飘起来，表明这是一个不平常的时刻，是革命暴风雨即将到来的时刻。我们看到，随着红太阳的升起，安源山区见到了红色的曙光，随着救星的到来，安源见到了青天。总之，山也好，天也好，树也好，云也好，这些都要有思想，构成艺术语言，为烘托我们心中的红太阳的伟大形象起到它们应起的作用。就拿画中层层叠叠的云彩来说吧，“乱云飞渡仍从容”，它既表明了毛主席是在阶级斗争激烈的时刻来到安源的，在这样的时刻毛主席是何等的从容、沉着、坚定，同时又预示着毛主席的到来，将掀起一场新的阶级斗争的风暴！
    在创作过程中，我们感到最最困难的和重要的是如何刻划毛主席的面部表情。由于过去革命斗争的艰苦，毛主席青年时代留下来的照片很少，很难做充分的参考；由于党内一小撮走资派害怕毛主席光辉的形象深深的印在革命群众心中，他们控制或不发表毛主席青年时代的照片；也由于在反革命修正主义文艺黑线的控制下，在那些“权威”“专家”的垄断下，表现毛主席光辉形象的很多美术作品是粗制滥造的，甚至是歪曲的，造成革命群众对毛主席青年时代光辉形象认识的混乱。在这种情况下，要把毛主席面部表情刻划成功，必须找到适当的解决办法。解决问题的关键在于要掌握毛泽东思想，用毛泽东思想指导去解决问题。我们经过反复学习、访问，明确要通过毛主席的面部表情表现毛主席“问苍茫大地，谁主沉浮”的博大的革命胸襟，表现毛主席“风华正茂”，“指点江山”的英雄气概，要表现毛主席全心全意为解放全中国和全人类的伟大抱负，要表现毛主席不畏狂水恶浪，勇敢、坚毅的革命精神。一句话，要表现我们心中最红最红的红太阳是世界上几百年，中国几千年出现的最最伟大的天才、杰出的英明的领袖。我们找到了仅能找到的几张毛主席青年时代的照片，一遍一遍地临摹，努力记下毛主席青年时代的年龄特征和形象特征。我们又收集了以后各个时期一直到文化大革命运动中的毛主席的照片，把我们见到、想到的毛主席形象融汇到一起，我们伟大领袖毛主席青年时代的形象在我们心中越来越清晰了。这时，我们仿佛也站在那二十世纪初叶乌云压顶，血雨腥风的安源山，见到身受帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义三座大山压迫，挣扎在水深火热中的安源工人；仿佛见到了他们心中烧起的万丈怒火；仿佛听到他们心里盼望救星早日到来的呼声；仿佛见到了一群一群的工人仰望着东方，盼望东方出红日；仿佛是闪电裹着惊雷轰鸣，狂风卷着骤雨怒号，在这不平常的“峥嵘岁月”，冲破乌云，一轮红日喷薄而出，我们心中最红最红的红太阳在安源山升起来了！仿佛见到了红日出山川，山川尽朝晖，救星来安源，安源见青天。毛主席向我们走来，向安源山走来。这时，我心中始终不能平静，吃不下饭，睡不着觉，必须拿起画笔，将这情景表现出来！我把所有的毛主席照片放在一边，拿起笔，凭着想象要把心中最红最红的红太阳描绘出来。我一遍一遍地画，边画边请老工人和同志们提意见。要把广大革命群众心目中对毛主席最美好的印象集中起来。每当我拿起画笔时心情就不能平静，我们夜以继日、废寝忘食地画呀，画呀！我们要把对毛主席的热爱和深情，融和着油彩交织在画面上。心里想着毛主席光耀天地的形象，口里念着毛主席气壮山河的诗章：“恰同学少年，风华正茂；书生意气，挥斥方遒。指点江山，激扬文字，粪土当年万户侯。”我越画越觉得浑身有力量。我们纵情欢呼、歌唱，祝我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席万寿无疆！万寿无疆！
    油画这个外来的艺术形式，长期以来是为资产阶级服务的，被视为“高级的艺术”，它的内容不是风景静物就是牛鬼蛇神。广大工农兵群众根本不爱看，也看不懂。他们反映说：一块一块的，我们看不懂；一堆一堆的，难看又难受。芭蕾舞能够用来为工农兵服务，难道油画就不能很好地为工农兵服务吗？毛主席指示我们要：“洋为中用、古为今用。”江青同志也鼓励我们要敢于创造，要不怕失败，力争革命的内容和尽可能完美的艺术形式的统一。虽然我没学过油画，但是学过一些绘画的基本知识，我们根据主题的需要，根据群众欣赏的习惯，利用了油画表现力丰富的特长和中国传统绘画刻划细致的优点，尝试着把这二者的特点结合起来。在这个过程中，也遭到了一些所谓的“内行”“专家”的反对：“你这个没有色彩”，“这象月份牌画，没意思。”也有的见了摇摇头就走掉了。但是，广大的革命群众却给予了热情的肯定，也有些搞油画的同志们热情地帮助我画下去。毛主席教导我们要创造“为中国老百姓所喜闻乐见的中国作风和中国气派”的作品，我们就是要努力创造这种新的形式新的风格。我们是以工农兵的要求为标准，不是以那些资产阶级专家权威的习惯做依据。我们没学过油画，不受旧框框、洋教条的束缚。工农兵喜欢什么样的，我们就努力用什么手段来表现。《毛主席去安源》这幅画，我们只是初次的尝试，有些问题还有待今后进一步解决。但是，我们充分相信，有了战无不胜的毛泽东思想，我们就能够攻克一切顽固的艺术堡垒！
    敬爱的江青同志亲自培育的闪耀着毛泽东思想光辉的八个革命样板戏和文艺新品种钢琴伴唱《红灯记》的诞生，使我们受到了极大的启发和教育，鼓舞着我们为创造无产阶级新文艺新品种而奋斗。《毛主席去安源》这幅油画能和全国人民见面，是毛主席的光辉思想和伟大革命实践教育和鼓舞我们的结果，是江青同志亲切关怀、热情支持我们的结果，是广大工农兵群众和红卫兵小将热情帮助我们的结果。我们深深懂得，我们的创作还仅仅是一个开端，这幅画还存在着一些缺点，离毛主席、党和人民对我们的要求还差的很远很远。无产阶级文化大革命赋予我们的战斗使命，还需要我们不屈不挠地继续奋斗。今后，我们一定高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，努力学习毛主席著作，到工农兵群众中去，到阶级斗争的大风大浪中去，彻底改造自己。同时，虚心向革命的戏曲工作者、音乐工作者学习，以江青同志为光辉榜样，做永远忠于伟大领袖毛主席，忠于战无不胜的毛泽东思想，忠于毛主席无产阶级革命路线的红色文艺战士，一辈子为工农兵服务，为无产阶级政治服务。
