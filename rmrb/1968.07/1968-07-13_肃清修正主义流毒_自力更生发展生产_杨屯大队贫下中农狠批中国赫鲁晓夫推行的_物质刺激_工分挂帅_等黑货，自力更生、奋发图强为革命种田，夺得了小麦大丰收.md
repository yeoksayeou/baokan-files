The poor and lower-middle peasants of Yangtun Production Brigade in Shandong Province have been actively studying and applying Chairman Mao Zedong's thoughts, conducting in-depth and sustained revolutionary criticism and struggle, eradicating revisionist poison, and developing production through self-reliance, resulting in a bumper harvest of wheat. This year, despite a reduction in chemical fertilizers, the brigade's more than 2,000 mu of wheat yielded an average of 450 jin per mu, an increase of over 10% compared to last year.

Yangtun Production Brigade used to have very low yields. Starting in 1965, the agents of the Chinese Khrushchev in Shandong promoted the "one leading eight" (i.e., Dongguo Brigade leading the surrounding eight brigades) black model here, and Yangtun Brigade was also "led" along. From then on, chemical fertilizers, pesticides, and various agricultural machinery poured in. In 1966, each mu received 130-140 jin of chemical fertilizer, in addition to a large amount of ammonium water, bean cake, and other fine fertilizers. Under these special favorable material conditions, that year's wheat yield per mu reached over 370 jin. At the same time, a handful of capitalist roaders within the party also vigorously advocated the theory of "class struggle extinction" and promoted the black goods of "work points as the commander," attempting to lead the members down the capitalist road.

In early 1967, after establishing a new leadership cadre, Yangtun Brigade, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, launched a thorough revolutionary criticism and struggle, completely eradicating the revisionist poison of "material incentives" and "work points as the commander" promoted by the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents, and promoting the ideological revolutionization of the people. They followed Chairman Mao's great teachings that the socialist road is the only road for China's agriculture, established Mao Zedong Thought study classes, and conducted learning and discussions on the issue of which road to take for developing agricultural production. Should we rely on "material incentives" and "work points as the commander" to increase grain production and take the capitalist road? Or should we rely on highlighting proletarian politics, with Mao Zedong Thought as the commander, and the revolutionization of people's ideology to increase grain production and take the bright socialist road of common prosperity? Through learning, discussion, and revolutionary criticism and struggle, the poor and lower-middle peasants' socialist consciousness was further raised. They said that the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents had been promoting "material incentives" in their brigade for the past few years, frantically using chemical fertilizers to cultivate "models," corrupting the members, and making everyone develop a single-minded reliance on the state, reducing the spirit of self-reliance and striving for progress. Due to relying on the state to supply chemical fertilizers, everyone increasingly did not pay attention to accumulating farm manure, wasting state chemical fertilizers and making the cost of grain increasingly higher. Some poor and lower-middle peasants used living facts to illustrate that implementing the black goods of "material incentives" and "work points as the commander" could only lead people down the capitalist road. They said that their brigade, due to vigorously promoting "bonus as the commander," expanded the quotas to over 2,000 types, not distinguishing between poor and lower-middle peasants or landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, and bad elements, as long as they exceeded the quota, they would all receive the same reward. The result was that those with more labor power among the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, and bad elements became rich, while they, the poor and lower-middle peasants, were cheated. This is a capitalist road that makes the poor and lower-middle peasants suffer twice! The more they criticized, the more they hated the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Shandong, and the more they loved the great leader Chairman Mao, firmly resolving to follow Chairman Mao and take the socialist road.

Through revolutionary criticism and struggle, Yangtun Brigade further raised the class consciousness and socialist consciousness of the broad masses of members, overcame the idea of relying on the state, and established a firm resolve of self-reliance and striving for progress. Last autumn, when sowing wheat, the members expressed that they would strive for a wheat bumper harvest even in the face of reduced chemical fertilizers. The entire brigade quickly launched a wave of accumulating soil and miscellaneous fertilizers, making the amount of soil and miscellaneous fertilizers applied to each mu of wheat this year more than double compared to the past.

After establishing the idea of "farming for the revolution," the broad masses of members significantly strengthened their sense of responsibility. They ensured high quality for every watering and every fertilization, striving to fully utilize the benefits of water and fertilizers.

    肃清修正主义流毒　自力更生发展生产
    杨屯大队贫下中农狠批中国赫鲁晓夫推行的“物质刺激”“工分挂帅”等黑货，自力更生、奋发图强为革命种田，夺得了小麦大丰收
    据新华社济南电　山东省曲阜县东郭公社杨屯大队贫下中农活学活用毛泽东思想，深入持久地开展革命大批判，肃清修正主义流毒，自力更生发展生产，小麦获得大丰收。今年全大队的两千多亩小麦，在化肥减少的情况下，平均亩产达到四百五十斤，比去年增产一成以上。
    杨屯大队过去产量很低。从一九六五年开始，中国赫鲁晓夫在山东的代理人在这里搞“一带八”（即东郭大队带周围八个大队）的黑样板，杨屯大队也被“带”上了。从此，化肥、农药和各种农业机械源源而来，一九六六年每亩施化肥达一百三四十斤，另外还有大量的氨水、豆饼等细肥。在这种特殊优厚的物质条件下，这一年小麦亩产量达到三百七十多斤。同时，党内一小撮走资派还在这里大肆鼓吹“阶级斗争熄灭”论，推行“工分挂帅”等黑货，妄图把社员引到资本主义的邪路上去。
    杨屯大队在一九六七年初，成立新的领导班子以后，以毛泽东思想为武器，狠抓革命大批判，彻底肃清中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人推行的“物质刺激”、“工分挂帅”等修正主义流毒，促进人的思想革命化。他们遵照毛主席关于社会主义的道路是我国农业唯一的道路的伟大教导，开办了毛泽东思想学习班，就发展农业生产走什么道路的问题进行了学习、讨论。是靠“物质刺激”、“工分挂帅”来增产粮食，走资本主义道路？还是靠突出无产阶级政治，靠毛泽东思想挂帅，靠人的思想革命化来增产粮食，走大家共同富裕的社会主义光明大道？经过学习、讨论，开展革命大批判，贫下中农的社会主义觉悟进一步提高了，他们说，中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人前几年在咱大队大搞“物质刺激”，拚命用化肥来培养“典型”，腐蚀了社员，使大家滋长单纯依赖国家的思想，自力更生、奋发图强的精神减少了。由于依靠国家供应化肥，大家越来越不重视积农家肥，既浪费了国家化肥，又使粮食成本越来越高。有的贫下中农用活生生的事实说明，实行“物质刺激”、“工分挂帅”那一套黑货，只能把人引到发展资本主义的邪路上去。他们说，我们大队由于大搞“奖金挂帅”，把定额发展到二千多种，不问贫下中农或地、富、反、坏，只要超过定额就同样受奖，结果肥了那些劳力多的地、富、反、坏，坑了咱们贫下中农，这是一条叫咱贫下中农受二遍苦的资本主义道路，我们坚决不能走下去！大家越批判，越是痛恨中国赫鲁晓夫及其在山东的代理人，更加热爱伟大领袖毛主席，坚定了跟着毛主席走社会主义道路的决心。
    杨屯大队通过革命大批判，进一步提高了广大社员的阶级觉悟和社会主义觉悟，克服了依赖国家的观念，树立起自力更生、奋发图强的坚强决心。去年秋天播种小麦时，社员们纷纷表示，在化肥减少的情况下也要争取小麦丰收。全大队很快掀起了一个大积土杂肥的热潮，使今年全大队每亩小麦施的土杂肥比过去猛增一倍多。
    广大社员在树立了“为革命种田”的思想后，工作责任心大大加强。他们每浇一遍水，每追一次肥，都讲究高质量，力求充分发挥水、肥的效益。
