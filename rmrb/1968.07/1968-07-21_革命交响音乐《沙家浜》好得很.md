The revolutionary symphony "Shajiabang" is a symphony that belongs to the proletariat, a symphony that belongs to the laboring people. This is a shining example of the cultural revolution carried out by revolutionary cultural workers under the guidance of the great leader Chairman Mao's instructions of "making the past serve the present and foreign things serve China," and under the personal cultivation of Comrade Jiang Qing. It is a brilliant gem in the treasure house of proletarian culture, a glorious milestone in the history of Chinese music.

The revolutionary symphony "Shajiabang" is excellent because it uses the unique expressive power of symphonic music to depict a great era, heroic people, an unparalleled army, and the heroic struggle of the domestic and international class enemies.

The revolutionary symphony "Shajiabang" praises the glorious achievements of the New Fourth Army, led by the Communist Party, and the broad masses of the people in resisting the Japanese invaders and puppet bandits in the water towns of Jiangnan. To better express this theme, the majestic and soaring New Fourth Army march is played several times throughout the piece.

The music begins with countless red flags fluttering in the wind on the stage. The orchestra plays the New Fourth Army march, accompanied by Peking opera percussion, a clear trumpet call, rapid drumbeats, and unrestrained, heroic brass music, creating a magnificent musical image of the New Fourth Army's countless soldiers charging forward, brandishing their swords to slay the wolves.

In the section titled "Raid," the symphony depicts a magnificent and grand battle scene. The majestic New Fourth Army march is repeatedly played, fully expressing the army's heroic posture as it "raids Shajiabang" and sweeps away the stubborn enemies. The music also intersperses low, dissonant chords, revealing the enemy's disarray as they flee in panic, dropping their helmets and armor.

When Shajiabang is liberated, the orchestra plays the New Fourth Army march at a slower tempo, fully utilizing the brass section to play a triumphant song of liberation. At this moment, a radiant portrait of the great leader Chairman Mao appears on the stage, and both the audience on stage and off stage shout in unison: Long live the great leader Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand ten thousand years! With tears of excitement, we think, the people of Shajiabang have seen the light again thanks to Chairman Mao's wise leadership! It is the great victory of Chairman Mao's people's war strategy! It is the great victory of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line!

The revolutionary symphony "Shajiabang" is excellent because it successfully portrays proletarian heroes. It particularly highlights the brilliant image of the New Fourth Army political commissar Guo Jianlight.

In the section titled "Perseverance," when the storm arrives, the symphony depicts boundless reed marshes, with howling winds, heavy rain, and thunderous roars. This grand scene more vividly contrasts Guo Jianlight and the other eighteen wounded soldiers' unyielding spirit as they stand firm against the enemy and the storm. As the storm subsides, the high-pitched sound of the suona accompanies the heroic and uplifting symphony, and Guo Jianlight sings loudly, "We must learn from the pine tree on the top of Mount Tai," followed by a powerful chorus. The majestic and proud voices echo through the sky, creating a musical climax.

Every time we hear this, we recall the teachings of the great leader Chairman Mao: "This army possesses an indomitable spirit. It will vanquish all enemies and will never be subdued by them. No matter how difficult and dangerous the situation, as long as there is one person, that person will continue to fight on." Therefore, we feel even more connected to this segment of the symphony and understand it more deeply. This segment of the symphony portrays Guo Jianlight and the other eighteen wounded soldiers standing firm against the storm and wind, guarding the reed marshes. It expresses their heroic spirit, like the pine tree on Mount Tai, "unbowed by the eight-thousand-mile storm, unshaken by the nine-thousand thunderbolts," standing tall and fearless. It fully expresses the hearts of countless revolutionary soldiers armed with Mao Zedong Thought, who strive tirelessly, remain steadfast, and are forever loyal to Chairman Mao, forever loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and forever loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

The revolutionary symphony "Shajiabang" is excellent because it follows Chairman Mao's teachings of "making the past serve the present and foreign things serve China," kicking out the Western dogma of symphonic music and smashing the old framework of symphonic music, making symphonic music something that the broad masses of laboring people can understand and enjoy.

The revolutionary symphony "Shajiabang" is a revolution in both its orchestration and composition. In terms of orchestration, it breaks away from the Western tradition by incorporating instruments beloved by the workers, peasants, and soldiers, such as the erhu, yueqin, sanxian, suona, and Peking opera percussion, enriching the expressive power of symphonic music for revolutionary themes. In terms of composition, it breaks away from the Western bourgeois notion of "pure music" and the outdated, decadent formula of "four movements." Based on the Peking opera "Shajiabang," it develops and creates something new. From beginning to end, the revolutionary symphony "Shajiabang" incorporates forms beloved by the workers, peasants, and soldiers, such as music, chorus, solo, duet, spoken dialogue, recitation, slide projections, and the choreography of the chorus members, organically combining them to achieve a high degree of unity between proletarian political content and perfect artistic form.

In the section titled "Strategy," the New Fourth Army's wounded soldiers are trapped in the reed marshes, and Ah Qing is anxious for her family. The symphony is deep and powerful, with a vast and distant atmosphere. It broadens our vision beyond the Spring Tea House to the vast reed marshes and the eighteen New Fourth Army wounded soldiers. At this moment, Ah Qing sings, "The wind is tight, the rain is thick, the sky is low and the clouds are dark; I can't sit still. My family is short of food and medicine, and the news is cut off. How can the reed marshes withstand the waves and floods? They are precious revolutionary assets, and the eighteen of them are connected to me like flesh and blood..." Here, the chorus members join in, expressing the deep bond between the soldiers and the people. This segment of music, with its solo and chorus, is deeply moving. We feel that it is not just Ah Qing who cares for the eighteen New Fourth Army soldiers, but all the people of Shajiabang and all the laboring masses of China who care for their own children. Listening to this, we, as revolutionary soldiers, cannot contain our excitement. Our eyes well up with tears, and we recite Chairman Mao's affectionate teachings, "The ultimate source of the great power of war lies in the masses of the people." Our hearts are stirred and cannot calm down. We firmly believe that with such politically conscious people and such a reliable reserve force, we will surely annihilate all harmful elements and have no enemies.

The successful birth and growth of the revolutionary symphony "Shajiabang" is a heavy blow to the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in the cultural world, such as Zhou Yang and Lin Mo Han. For a long time, these counter-revolutionary revisionists have promoted the revisionist cultural line, fiercely resisting Chairman Mao's revolutionary cultural line. They have elevated bourgeois symphonic works as "classics" and praised them as "the pinnacle of human culture," attempting to poison the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers with bourgeois goods. Our beloved Comrade Jiang Qing, leading revolutionary cultural warriors, has broken through countless obstacles and captured the bourgeois stronghold of symphonic music. The birth of the revolutionary symphony "Shajiabang" declares the failure of the revisionist cultural line and opens up a new path for proletarian symphonic music.

We must press on, following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, and carry out a thorough and sustained revolutionary criticism. We must thoroughly expose and criticize the counter-revolutionary revisionist cultural line and its ultimate backers, ensuring that the heroic figures of workers, peasants, and soldiers forever occupy the stage of proletarian culture. Let the new proletarian culture shine with even more brilliant light!

    革命交响音乐《沙家浜》好得很
    装甲兵某部　孟祥林　夏网培　孔令铜
    革命交响音乐《沙家浜》是一部属于无产阶级的交响音乐，是一部属于劳动人民的交响音乐。这是革命文艺工作者遵照伟大领袖毛主席“古为今用，洋为中用”的指示，在江青同志亲自培育下进行文艺革命的光辉样板。这是无产阶级文艺宝库中一颗光彩夺目的明珠，是我国音乐史上的光辉里程碑。
    革命交响音乐《沙家浜》好，就好在运用交响乐的特殊表现力，展现出一个伟大的时代、英雄的人民、举世无双的军队和国内外阶级敌人进行英勇斗争的广阔的历史画卷。
    革命交响音乐《沙家浜》，歌颂的是在江南水乡，共产党所领导的新四军和广大人民群众抗击日伪匪军的光辉业绩。为了更好地表达这个主题，雄壮、高昂的新四军军歌，前后出现几次，贯串全曲。
    乐曲一开始，天幕上映出无数面红旗，迎风飘扬。乐队高奏新四军军歌，配合着京剧打击乐，嘹亮的号声，急促的鼓点，奔放、豪迈的铜管乐声，塑造了新四军千军万马齐奔腾，奋臂挥刀斩豺狼的宏伟的音乐形象。
    在《奔袭》这一段里，交响音乐描绘了雄伟壮丽的战争场面。气势磅礴的新四军军歌反复演奏，充分表现了我军“飞兵奇袭沙家浜”，横扫顽敌的雄姿。乐曲中还穿插着低沉的不协和音，揭示了敌军被打得丢盔卸甲，抱头鼠窜的狼狈相。
    当沙家浜解放时，乐队奏着放慢了速度的新四军军歌，极大的发挥了铜管乐的作用，奏出了沙家浜得到了解放，军民欢庆胜利的凯歌。就在这时，天幕上出现了光芒四射的伟大领袖毛主席的画像，台上台下同声欢呼：伟大领袖毛主席万岁！万万岁！我们含着激动的热泪在想，沙家浜人民重见光明是毛主席英明领导的结果！是毛主席人民战争思想的伟大胜利！是毛主席无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利！
    革命交响音乐《沙家浜》好，就好在成功地塑造了无产阶级的英雄人物。特别突出地刻划了新四军指导员郭建光这个光辉的形象。
    在《坚持》这一段，当暴风雨来临时，交响乐烘托出无边无际的芦荡，风狂雨骤、雷声隆隆。这一宏大场景，更加鲜明地映衬出郭建光等十八位伤病员坚如磐石，战胜敌寇和暴风雨的大无畏精神。风雨初歇，响起唢呐高昂的音调，伴着豪迈激昂的交响乐，郭建光引吭高歌“要学那泰山顶上一青松”，随即爆发了气壮山河的合唱，雄伟自豪的歌声在长空回荡，组成了音乐高潮。
    我们每听到这里，耳边就响起伟大领袖毛主席的教导：“这个军队具有一往无前的精神，它要压倒一切敌人，而决不被敌人所屈服。不论在任何艰难困苦的场合，只要还有一个人，这个人就要继续战斗下去。”因此我们对这段交响音乐感到更亲切，领会得更深。这段交响音乐塑造了郭建光等十八位伤病员顶暴雨，迎狂风，坚守芦荡的高大形象；表现了郭建光等十八位伤病员，象泰山顶上的青松，“八千里风暴吹不倒，九千个雷霆也难轰”，顶天立地，无所畏惧的英雄气概。充分地表达了用毛泽东思想武装起来的千千万万革命战士艰苦奋斗，坚韧不拔，永远忠于毛主席，永远忠于毛泽东思想，永远忠于毛主席革命路线的颗颗红心。
    革命交响音乐《沙家浜》好，就好在遵循毛主席“古为今用，洋为中用”的教导，踢开了交响音乐的洋教条，打烂了交响乐的旧框框，使交响乐成为广大劳动人民听得懂、喜欢听的好音乐。
    革命交响音乐《沙家浜》，从乐队的组成到创作都是一次大革命。在乐队的组成上，打破了西洋乐队的陈规，在西洋乐队里加进了我们工农兵所喜闻乐见的京胡、月琴、三弦、唢呐和京剧打击乐，更加丰富了交响音乐对于革命题材的表现力。在创作上，打破了西洋资产阶级的所谓纯“音乐”、“四个乐章”陈旧的没落的俗套。在京剧《沙家浜》的基础上，有所发展，有所创造。革命交响音乐《沙家浜》从头至尾，穿插运用了我们工农兵喜闻乐见的形式，如音乐、合唱、独唱、对唱、念白、朗诵、幻灯布景、合唱队员的造型动作等，把它们有机地结合在一起，达到了无产阶级政治内容和完美的艺术形式的高度统一。
    在《授计》这段音乐里，当时新四军的伤病员被困在芦荡里，阿庆嫂为亲人们焦急不安。交响乐声显得非常深沉、有力，意境深远、辽阔。使我们的眼界不局限于春来茶馆，而联想到那浩渺的芦荡，那十八位新四军伤病员。这时候阿庆嫂唱道“风声紧，雨意浓，天低云暗；不由人一阵阵坐立不安。亲人们粮缺药尽消息又断，芦荡内怎禁得浪激水淹？他们是革命的宝贵财产，十八个人都和我骨肉相连。……”在这里，就打破框框配上了合唱队员的伴唱，更表达出军民之间血肉相连，鱼水情深。这段音乐和独唱、合唱，我们听起来声声入耳，句句动心。我们感到不是阿庆嫂一个人关心十八位新四军战士，而是全沙家浜的人民群众都在关心十八位血肉相连的新四军战士，全中国劳苦大众都在关心自己的子弟兵。听到这里，我们身为一个革命战士，实在压抑不住内心的激动。我们眼里含着泪花，嘴里念着毛主席“战争的伟力之最深厚的根源，存在于民众之中”的亲切教导，心头久久不能平静。我们坚信，有这样的具有高度政治觉悟的人民，有这样坚强可靠的后备力量，就一定能消灭一切害人虫，全无敌。
    革命交响音乐《沙家浜》的胜利诞生和茁壮地成长，是射向中国赫鲁晓夫及其在文艺界的代理人周扬、林默涵之流的一颗重型炮弹。长期以来，这一小撮反革命修正主义分子极力推行修正主义文艺黑线，疯狂抵制毛主席的革命文艺路线。把资产阶级交响乐作品奉为“经典”，吹捧为“人类文化的高峰”，妄想拿资产阶级货色来毒害广大的工农兵群众。我们敬爱的江青同志，率领革命文艺战士，冲破重重阻力，攻克了交响乐这个资产阶级顽固堡垒。革命交响音乐《沙家浜》的诞生，宣告了修正主义文艺路线的破产，为无产阶级的交响音乐开辟了崭新的道路。
    我们一定要乘胜前进，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，深入持久地开展革命大批判，把反革命修正主义文艺黑线及其总后台批深批透，批倒批臭。让工农兵英雄人物永远占领无产阶级的文艺舞台。让无产阶级新文艺放射出更加灿烂的光辉！
