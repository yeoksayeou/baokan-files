We are graduates of 1967. As we are about to take up new posts, we watched the Beijing Peking Opera Troupe's revolutionary model opera "The Harbor" with great excitement. We received profound education and inspiration, further strengthening our resolve to follow the glorious path of integrating with the workers and peasants.

The modern revolutionary Peking opera "The Harbor" successfully portrays the heroic image of dock workers, reflecting the great aspirations of the Chinese working class who, while working on the docks, have their hearts with the motherland and their eyes on the world. It deeply reflects the intense struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie for the hearts of the younger generation.

In the play, the young worker Han Xiaqiang, a son of dock workers, despises the ordinary work of loading and unloading due to the influence of bourgeois ideology. The representative of the bourgeoisie, Qian Shouwei, under the pretext of caring for Han Xiaqiang's future, relentlessly instills bourgeois poison, viciously slandering dock workers as "stinking laborers" and "always bowing to others." Under the corruption of people like Qian Shouwei, the young worker Han Xiaqiang becomes increasingly discontented with his work, distracted, and causes serious accidents. He even goes so far as to demand a transfer and leave the harbor.

Party branch secretary Fang Haizhen, veteran worker Ma Hongliang, and loading team leader Gao Zhiyang patiently and sincerely gave Han Xiaqiang a serious class education, finally making him realize the importance of dock work and see through the evil intentions of people like Qian Shouwei. This incident gave us a vivid class education lesson. It rang an alarm for us, making us deeply feel that we young people are the objects of struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie. We must use Mao Zedong Thought to transform our worldview; otherwise, we will easily be hit by the bourgeois sugar-coated bullets and become their successors.

Recently, the proletarian headquarters, led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, issued the great call to "face the countryside, face the grassroots, face the borders, and face the factories and mines." This is Chairman Mao's greatest concern, care, and trust for our young generation. For thousands of years, the exploiting classes have repeatedly spread the reactionary theory of "those who labor with their minds rule, and those who labor with their strength are ruled." Chinese Khrushchev, in order to achieve his shameful goal of restoring capitalism, has long promoted a whole set of revisionist youth work lines. He vigorously advocates the theory of "class struggle extinction," peddling the black goods of studying to become officials and suffering small losses to gain big advantages. He attempts to cultivate us into spiritual aristocrats who stand above the laboring people and become tools for their restoration of capitalism. We are the children of poor and lower-middle peasants, and we are the new generation nurtured by Mao Zedong Thought. We resolutely follow Chairman Mao's words and take the revolutionary road of integrating intellectuals with workers and peasants. We thoroughly criticize the reactionary thought of "all professions are lowly, only studying is noble" and thoroughly criticize the bourgeois educational system. Chairman Mao teaches us: "How do we judge whether a young person is revolutionary? What standard do we use? What do we use to distinguish them? There is only one standard, that is, whether they are willing and actually integrate with the broad masses of workers and peasants." Countless historical facts prove that separating from the workers and peasants is separating from the revolution, and opposing the workers and peasants is opposing the revolution. Let all the fallacies of "college students becoming peasants or workers not being worthwhile" go to hell!

Go to the countryside, go to the borders, go to the factories and mines, go to the grassroots, go to where the motherland needs us the most! Contribute everything we have to the socialist revolution and socialist construction. In the fiery three great revolutionary movements of class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experimentation, temper ourselves into reliable successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause.

    接革命班，做革命人
    北京地质学院学生　袁长青　沙丁茂　黄品文
    我们是一九六七年的毕业生。在即将走上新的战斗岗位的时候，我们怀着激动的心情，观看了北京京剧团演出的革命样板戏《海港》，受到了极大的教育和鼓舞。进一步增强了我们走和工农群众相结合的光辉道路的坚定决心。
    京剧革命现代戏《海港》，成功地塑造了海港码头工人的英雄形象，反映了中国工人阶级身在码头，胸怀祖国，放眼世界的壮志豪情，深刻地反映了无产阶级同资产阶级争夺青年一代的激烈斗争。
    剧中青年工人韩小强，是码头工人的儿子，由于受资产阶级思想的影响，看不起平凡的搬运工作。资产阶级的代表人物钱守维，打着关心韩小强的“前途”的幌子，无孔不入地向他灌输资产阶级思想毒素，恶毒地诬蔑码头工人是“臭苦力”“见人都矮三分”。在钱守维之流的腐蚀下，青年工人韩小强越来越不安心工作，精神涣散，造成工作中的严重事故。甚至发展到要求调动工作、离开海港。
    党支部书记方海珍，老工人马洪亮，装卸组长高志扬耐心、恳切地对韩小强进行了严肃的阶级教育，终于使韩小强认识到码头工作的重要意义，同时看清了钱守维之流的险恶用心。这件事给我们上了一堂生动的阶级教育课。它给我们敲了一次警钟，使我们深深感到，我们青年人是无产阶级和资产阶级两个阶级争夺的对象。我们必须用毛泽东思想改造自己的世界观，否则，就很容易被资产阶级的糖衣炮弹打中，成为他们的接班人。
    最近，以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部向我们发出了
  “面向农村，面向基层，面向边疆，面向工矿”的伟大号召，这是毛主席对我们青年一代的最大关怀，最大爱护，最大信任。几千年来，剥削阶级一再散布“劳心者治人，劳力者治于人”的反动论调。中国赫鲁晓夫为了达到他复辟资本主义的可耻目的，长期以来，推行了一整套修正主义的青年工作路线。他竭力鼓吹“阶级斗争熄灭”论，大肆贩卖读书做官，吃小亏占大便宜等黑货。企图把我们培养成高踞于劳动人民头上的精神贵族，成为他们复辟资本主义的工具。我们是贫下中农的子弟，是在毛泽东思想哺育下成长起来的新一代。我们坚决听毛主席的话，走知识分子和工农相结合的革命化道路。彻底批判“万般皆下品，唯有读书高”的反动思想，彻底批判资产阶级教育制度。毛主席教导我们：“看一个青年是不是革命的，拿什么做标准呢？拿什么去辨别他呢？只有一个标准，这就是看他愿意不愿意，并且实行不实行和广大的工农群众结合在一块。”无数历史事实证明，脱离工农，就是脱离革命，反对工农就是反对革命。让那些“大学生当农民、当工人不合算”的谬论统统见鬼去吧！
    到农村去，到边疆去，到工矿去，到基层去，到祖国最需要的地方去！为社会主义革命和社会主义建设贡献我们的一切。在阶级斗争、生产斗争、科学实验三大革命运动烈火中，把自己锻炼成无产阶级革命事业的可靠接班人。
