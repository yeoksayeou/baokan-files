Nearly 500,000 workers from various industries across Uruguay held a 24-hour general strike on July 2 to protest the government's wage freeze and intensified suppression of workers and student movements. This was the second nationwide general strike by Uruguayan workers in the past two weeks.

The general strike began at midnight on July 2. This strike halted all trains nationwide, closed 20 banks in the capital, suspended all public transportation, ceased airline operations, paralyzed the ports, stopped production in most factories, prevented all newspapers from publishing, and partially disrupted electricity, gas supplies, and telephone communications. Approximately half of the commercial sector in Montevideo was paralyzed, and all large stores were closed.

At noon, a group of university students, under the tight security of reactionary military police, took to the streets to hold a demonstration. They threw stones at the military police's patrol cars. In the dock area, striking workers and students engaged in a fierce struggle with the police.

Before the general strike, Uruguay's president held an emergency meeting with the ministers of defense and the interior, as well as senior military and police officials. After the meeting, they ordered the national army to stand by, ready to suppress the striking workers, and mobilized 3,000 retired soldiers, increasing the Uruguayan army from 12,000 to 15,000 personnel. Meanwhile, the Uruguayan authorities ordered a large number of troops from the interior to be dispatched to Montevideo to deal with the strike movement. In addition, after imposing military control over some banks, the Uruguayan authorities announced on the night of July 1 that they would also impose military control over the electricity, telecommunications, water, and fuel sectors, threatening to impose "severe penalties" on workers in these sectors if they participated in the general strike. The government authorities also forced all newspaper offices to submit their proofs for review before publishing and prohibited newspapers from reporting on the strike and demonstrations.

Despite the Uruguayan authorities' various attempts to prevent this general strike, the broad masses of workers, undeterred by the authorities' high-pressure tactics, took decisive strike action.

    抗议反动政府冻结工资和镇压工人学生运动
    乌拉圭五十万职工再次举行总罢工
    罢工使火车停驶，银行关闭，交通断绝，港口瘫痪，大部分工厂生产停顿
    据新华社三日讯　蒙得维的亚消息：乌拉圭全国近五十万名各行业职工，二日举行二十四小时总罢工，抗议政府实行冻结工资和加紧镇压工人和学生运动。这是过去两星期内乌拉圭工人群众举行的第二次全国性总罢工。
    总罢工从二日凌晨开始。这次总罢工使全国火车停驶，首都二十家银行关闭，公共交通全部断绝，航空公司停止营业，港口完全瘫痪，大部分工厂的生产停顿，所有报纸都没有出版，电力、煤气供应和电话联系也部分断绝。蒙得维的亚商业部门大约有一半陷于瘫痪，大商店也都关门停业。
    中午时候，一批大学生在反动军警戒备森严的情况下，冲上街头举行了示威游行，他们向军警的巡逻车扔石头，在码头区，罢工工人、学生同警察进行了一次激烈的搏斗。
    在总罢工举行之前，乌拉圭总统同国防和内政部长、高级军警官员举行会议，进行紧急策划，会后命令全国军队严阵以待，准备对罢工工人进行镇压；并宣布动员三千名退伍军人，使乌拉圭军队从一万二千人增加到一万五千人。与此同时，乌拉圭当局还下令从内地调动大批军队前往蒙得维的亚，以便对付罢工运动。此外，乌拉圭当局在对一些银行实行军事控制之后，又在一日晚间宣布对电力、电讯、自来水和燃料部门也实行军事控制，并且威胁这些部门的职工如果参加总罢工，就要对他们实行“严厉的制裁”。政府当局同时强迫各报社在出版报纸之前要送审校样，不准报纸刊登有关罢工和示威的新闻。
    尽管乌拉圭当局千方百计阻止这次总罢工，但是，广大职工不顾当局的高压手段，采取了坚决的罢工行动。
