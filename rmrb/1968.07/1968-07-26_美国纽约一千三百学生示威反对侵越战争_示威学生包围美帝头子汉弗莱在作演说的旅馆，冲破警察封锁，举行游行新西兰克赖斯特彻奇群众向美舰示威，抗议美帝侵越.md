	New York, July 25 -- More than 1,300 young students in New York City surrounded the "Waldorf-Astoria" hotel, where U.S. Vice President Humphrey was delivering a speech, on the night of July 23. They broke through the police blockade and held a large demonstration against U.S. imperialism's aggression in Vietnam in the heart of New York City.

	Humphrey, in order to compete in the U.S. presidential election farce this year, held a banquet on the night of July 23 at the luxurious "Waldorf-Astoria" hotel in New York City to entertain a small group of monopoly capitalists who contributed money to his election campaign. He then delivered a speech to them. At this time, 1,300 young students in New York City surrounded the hotel and held a powerful demonstration, carrying banners that opposed the U.S. aggression in Vietnam and protested the election fraud.

	The reactionary ruling clique of the United States, frightened by this demonstration, quickly dispatched several hundred policemen and special agents to set up a blockade around the hotel. However, the students, fearless of violence and arrest, finally broke through the police blockade and held a demonstration against the U.S. aggression in Vietnam in the heart of New York City. They ended the demonstration with a mass rally at "Times Square."

	Wellington, July 24 -- Several dozen people in Christchurch, New Zealand, demonstrated on July 23 at the port of Lyttelton against two U.S. warships, the "Rueus" and the "Mansfield," which were involved in the aggression in Vietnam.

	The demonstrators held banners condemning U.S. imperialism's aggression in Vietnam and demanded, "Yankees, go home!"

    美国纽约一千三百学生示威反对侵越战争
    示威学生包围美帝头子汉弗莱在作演说的旅馆，冲破警察封锁，举行游行新西兰克赖斯特彻奇群众向美舰示威，抗议美帝侵越
    新华社二十五日讯　纽约消息：一千三百余名纽约市青年学生，二十三日晚包围了美国副总统汉弗莱正在作演说的“沃尔多夫—阿斯托利亚”旅馆，并冲破了警察的层层阻挠，在纽约市中心举行了反对美帝国主义侵略越南战争的大示威。
    汉弗莱为了在今年美国总统选举的丑剧中竞选当总统，二十三日晚在纽约市中心豪华的“沃尔多夫—阿斯托利亚”旅馆设宴招待出钱为他竞选的一小撮垄断资本家，并向他们发表演说。这时，纽约市的一千三百名青年学生包围了这个旅馆，并高举反对侵越战争和抗议选举骗局等标语，举行了声势浩大的示威。
    被这次示威吓破了胆的美国反动统治集团，急急忙忙地派来了好几百名警察和特务，在这个旅馆的周围布置了一道封锁线。但是学生们不畏强暴，不怕逮捕，终于冲破了警察的封锁，在纽约市中心举行了反对侵越战争的示威游行，最后还在“时报广场”举行了群众大会。
    新华社惠灵顿二十四日电　新西兰克赖斯特彻奇市数十名群众，二十三日在利特尔顿港向两艘侵越美国军舰“瑞乌斯号”和“曼斯菲尔德号”示威，抗议美帝国主义侵略越南。
    示威者举着谴责美帝国主义侵略越南的标语，要求“美国佬滚回老家去”。
