The Afro-Asian Writers' Permanent Bureau issued a statement on July 4th, exposing and condemning the so-called "Non-Proliferation Treaty" adopted by the United Nations General Assembly on June 12th as a fraud and a major conspiracy against the peoples of various countries.

The statement pointed out that the so-called "Non-Proliferation Treaty" was jointly plotted by the United States and the Soviet Union. Its purpose is to serve the close collusion between U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism in dominating the world. It aims to consolidate the "nuclear monopoly" of the U.S. and the Soviet Union, turning non-nuclear countries into their "protectorates," thereby developing a new form of imperialism—nuclear imperialism. This is another example of the Soviet modern revisionist leadership clique colluding with U.S. and British imperialists to intimidate the anti-imperialist revolutionary movements of the peoples in Asia, Africa, Latin America, and other regions of the world.

The statement said that this so-called "treaty" itself is an unequal treaty. It does not prohibit U.S. and British imperialists and Soviet modern revisionists from further developing their own nuclear weapons, nor does it restrict them from stockpiling and even using nuclear weapons in war. Instead, it ties the hands of other signatory countries, depriving them of the right to develop their own nuclear weapons for self-defense. Moreover, this "treaty" also protects the U.S. nuclear-equipped aggression bases in many countries around the world.

The statement said that the most sinister plot of this "treaty" is to establish an anti-revolutionary nuclear alliance between U.S. and British imperialists and the Soviet modern revisionist leadership, directed against China. This is because China has shattered their nuclear monopoly and nuclear blackmail, promoted the struggle of the world's peoples against imperialism and colonialism led by the United States, and against modern revisionism and reactionaries led by the Soviet revisionist clique, defending the cause of national independence, people's democracy, and socialism.

The statement said that the greatest revolutionary leader in the world, Chairman Mao, pointed out: "The atomic bombs and hydrogen bombs that the U.S. imperialists have in their hands are paper tigers. As far as the people are concerned, atomic bombs are paper tigers." The statement called on all writers and peoples in Asia, Africa, Latin America, and other regions of the world to expose and condemn the "Non-Proliferation Treaty" concocted by U.S. and British imperialists and Soviet modern revisionists, which aims to obstruct the anti-imperialist revolutionary struggle of the world's peoples.

    亚非作家常设局指出“防止核扩散条约”是一个大骗局
    美苏核恶霸大肆推行核殖民主义
    中国粉碎了美苏核垄断核讹诈，促进了世界人民反帝反修斗争
    新华社四日讯　亚非作家常设局四日发表声明，揭露和谴责联合国大会六月十二日通过的所谓“防止核扩散条约”是一个骗局，是反对各国人民的又一大阴谋。
    声明指出，所谓“防止核扩散条约”，是美苏共同策划的，它的目的是为美帝和苏修紧密勾结称霸世界效劳，是企图巩固美苏的“核垄断”，把非核国家变成他们的“保护国”，从而发展一种新型的殖民主义——核殖民主义。这是苏联现代修正主义领导集团勾结美英帝国主义者，企图吓唬亚非拉和世界其他地区的人民反帝革命运动的又一例证。
    声明说，这个所谓的“条约”本身就是一个不平等条约。它没有禁止美英帝国主义者和苏联现代修正主义者进一步发展他们自己的核武器，也没有限制他们贮存和甚至在战争中使用核武器，相反，却束缚了其他签字国的手脚，剥夺他们为了自卫而发展他们自己的核武器的权利。而且，这个“条约”还保护了美国设在世界许多国家的核装备的侵略战争基地。
    声明说，这个“条约”的最恶毒的阴谋，是在美英帝国主义者和苏联现代修正主义领导集团之间建立矛头针对中国的反革命核同盟，因为中国粉碎了他们的核垄断和核讹诈，促进了世界人民反对以美国为首的帝国主义和殖民主义，以及以苏修领导集团为首的现代修正主义和各国反动派，维护了民族独立、人民民主和社会主义的事业。
    声明说，全世界最伟大的革命领袖毛主席指出：“美帝国主义手里的原子弹、氢弹，是吓不倒一切不愿意做奴隶的人们的。”声明呼吁亚非拉及世界其他地区的所有作家和人民，揭露和谴责美英帝国主义者和苏联现代修正主义者合伙炮制的企图阻止世界人民反帝革命斗争的“防止核扩散条约”。
