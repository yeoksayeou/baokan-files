Under the great situation of winning a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and on the joyous occasion of celebrating the 47th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China, we have been entrusted with the honorable task of performing the revolutionary model operas "Sha Jianhu" and "The Harbor." The Central Cultural Revolution Group and Comrade Jiang Qing have renamed our troupe the "Beijing Peking Opera Troupe," which is a double blessing, and our spirits are soaring. This is the greatest concern, encouragement, trust, and spur from our great leader Chairman Mao, Vice Chairman Lin, the Central Cultural Revolution Group, and Comrade Jiang Qing. Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's teachings of "ancient for modern use, foreign for Chinese use," Comrade Jiang Qing instructed us to use the piano to accompany the Peking opera "The Red Lantern," creating a new genre of proletarian revolutionary art. This points out a broad future for the revolution of Peking opera and shows us the direction for continued progress. At the same time, it opens up a new path for Western musical instruments and symphonic music, and a new path for the dramatic accompaniment of our great motherland. Once again, it demonstrates the immense power of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line in the arts.

The birth of the revolutionary model operas has gone through a sharp and complex struggle. Since 1963, under the leadership of Comrade Jiang Qing, we have been vigorously promoting the revolution of Peking opera. Every rehearsal and every performance have been permeated with the fierce struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines. Every rehearsal and every performance are battles to study, propagate, and defend Mao Zedong Thought and Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. The Chinese Khrushchev and his clique, using the power they have usurped, have long promoted a counter-revolutionary revisionist black line in the arts. In the field of drama, they have performed plays about emperors, generals, and romantic tales, serving the interests of the imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries, and the landlords and bourgeoisie. Under the leadership of Comrade Jiang Qing, we have resolutely fought against them. We must stage and perform revolutionary modern Peking operas that propagate Mao Zedong Thought and Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and proletarian politics. The birth of the revolutionary model opera "Sha Jianhu" is the result of Comrade Jiang Qing leading our revolutionary performers, using Mao Zedong Thought as a guide, and emerging from the struggle. This is Comrade Jiang Qing's great achievement, a major victory for Chairman Mao's revolutionary line in the arts, and a nuclear bomb fired at the domestic and foreign class enemies on the stage. Therefore, the appearance of "Sha Jianhu" and the other seven revolutionary model operas has shocked all of China, startled the world, and opened a brilliant new chapter in the history of human arts. Today, when we receive the battle task and hear the revolutionary music of "Sha Jianhu" again, our blood boils. We have even greater hatred for the Chinese Khrushchev and, at the same time, an immense love for our great leader Chairman Mao wells up in our hearts. We must shout a thousand and ten thousand times: Long live the great leader Chairman Mao! Ten thousand times long live!

All revolutionary artists of our troupe unanimously declare: We must firmly hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, fully express the fighting spirit and enthusiastic political passion unleashed by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. We must resolutely carry out Chairman Mao's great call to "grasp revolution, promote production," turn the stage into a battlefield for propagating Mao Zedong Thought, turn the theater into a battlefield for carrying out the great criticism, and turn the performance into a large classroom for studying and applying Chairman Mao's works.

Through our performances, we must constantly reform our worldview and truly stand on the side of the workers, peasants, and soldiers. We must always remember Chairman Mao's teachings: "A person's abilities may be great or small, but as long as they have this spirit, they are a person of noble character, a pure person, a person of morality, a person who has risen above petty interests, and a person who benefits the people." We must use the highest directives to inspire and spur ourselves, determined to transform ourselves into people who are dedicated to the public good. We must take Chairman Mao's teachings of "extreme responsibility to work, extreme enthusiasm for comrades and the people" as our guiding principle and standard for checking the quality of our performances. We are determined to follow Comrade Jiang Qing's instructions and dedicate ourselves to building the Beijing Peking Opera Troupe into a truly proletarianized, militarized revolutionary model Peking opera troupe.

    让革命样板戏永放光芒
    北京京剧团革命委员会
    在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的大好形势下，在全国人民欢庆中国共产党诞生四十七周年的大喜的日子里，我们接受了演出革命样板戏《沙家浜》和《海港》的光荣任务。中央文革和江青同志又给我团命名为“北京京剧团”，真是双喜临门，群情振奋。这是伟大领袖毛主席、林副主席、中央文革和江青同志，对我们最大的关怀，最大的鼓舞，最大的信任，最大的鞭策。江青同志根据毛主席的“古为今用，洋为中用”的教导，指示我们用钢琴为京剧《红灯记》伴唱，创造出了无产阶级革命文艺的新品种，为京剧革命指出了广阔的前途，给我们京剧革命工作者指出了继续前进的方向。同时，为西洋乐器和交响乐开辟了一条新的道路，为我们伟大祖国的戏剧伴奏开辟了一条新的道路。又一次显示了毛主席无产阶级革命文艺路线的无比威力。
    革命样板戏的诞生，是经历过一场尖锐、复杂的斗争的。从一九六三年我们在江青同志的领导下，大搞京剧革命以来，每一场排练，每一场演出都贯穿着两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的激烈斗争。每一场排练，每一场演出都是学习、宣传和捍卫毛泽东思想、毛主席革命路线的战斗。中国的赫鲁晓夫及其一伙，利用他们窃取的大权，多年来推行了一条反革命修正主义文艺黑线。在戏剧方面大演帝王将相、才子佳人，为帝、修、反服务，为地主和资产阶级服务。我们在江青同志的领导下坚决斗争。我们要大排大演宣传毛泽东思想、宣传毛主席革命路线，为工农兵服务、为无产阶级政治服务的革命现代京剧。革命样板戏《沙家浜》的诞生就是江青同志率领我团革命演职员，以毛泽东思想为指针，披荆斩棘，从斗争当中产生出来的。这是江青同志的丰功伟绩，是毛主席革命文艺路线的重大胜利，是戏剧舞台上，向国内外阶级敌人发射出的一颗原子弹。因此，《沙家浜》和其他七个革命样板戏的出现，轰动了全中国，震惊了全世界，在人类文艺史上揭开了光辉灿烂的新篇章。今天，当我们接到战斗任务，再一次听到《沙家浜》的革命乐曲的时候，我们的热血沸腾了。我们更加增长了对中国赫鲁晓夫的仇恨，同时也从心里涌起对伟大领袖毛主席的无比热爱。我们要千遍万遍地高呼：伟大领袖毛主席万岁，万万岁！
    我团全体革命文艺战士一致表示：一定要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，把无产阶级文化大革命焕发出来的战斗精神和饱满的政治热情，充分表现出来。我们要坚决执行毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，把舞台当作宣传毛泽东思想的阵地，把剧场当作开展革命大批判的战场，把演出当作活学活用毛主席著作的大课堂。
    我们要通过演出，不断地改造自己的世界观，把阶级立场真正移到工农兵这方面来。我们一定牢记毛主席的教导：“一个人能力有大小，但只要有这点精神，就是一个高尚的人，一个纯粹的人，一个有道德的人，一个脱离了低级趣味的人，一个有益于人民的人。”我们要用最高指示激励自己，鞭策自己，决心把自己改造成为一心为公的人。我们一定要把毛主席“对工作的极端的负责任，对同志对人民的极端的热忱”的教导，作为指导和检查演出质量的座右铭。我们决心按照江青同志的指示，为把北京京剧团建设成为一个真正无产阶级化的、战斗化的革命京剧样板团而献出自己的一切。
