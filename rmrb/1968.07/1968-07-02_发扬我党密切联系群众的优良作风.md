	Carry Forward the Party's Fine Tradition of Close Ties with the Masses
	Sun Leyi, a model soldier in studying and applying Chairman Mao's thought from the Jinan Military Region, and the Director of the Logistics Department of a certain unit

	When a sprouting elm tree is nourished by rain, it grows more luxuriant; when a child sees his mother, how can he not be close to her? Dear Chairman Mao! The warriors loyal to you, seeing you, how can they suppress the boundless excitement and happiness in their hearts! The thousand words surging in our hearts condense into one sentence: Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years of long life to Chairman Mao!

	Dear Chairman Mao! For forty-seven years, it is you who have led us to overcome countless difficulties and dangers on the revolutionary road, achieving one victory after another! It is you who personally cultivated the Party's fine tradition of close ties with the masses. You trust the masses the most, care for the masses the most, and respect the revolutionary initiative of the masses the most. Your revolutionary line is the most thoroughgoing mass line. Defending your revolutionary line is to protect the masses and to protect the revolutionary spirit of the masses. In the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, you issued the battle cry: "The People's Liberation Army should support the leftist broad masses." This is your greatest concern and love for the revolutionary masses and the broad revolutionary masses. I resolutely carry out your great instructions, go deep into the front lines of "three supports, two militaries," propagate your brilliant thoughts to the broad revolutionary people, and fight together with them and achieve victory together for defending your proletarian revolutionary line. When supporting the left in a factory, I resolutely supported the revolutionary masses of the proletariat, and according to your great teachings: "The work of ideological remolding is a long-term, patient, and painstaking task," I did ideological work among the deceived masses. At first, some deceived masses ignored me, so I went to their doors to propagate your latest instructions, and I did not lose heart even when I encountered setbacks. There was a worker who was deceived, and I talked to him eight times in a row, but it had no effect. What should I do? Chairman Mao, in times of difficulty, thinking of you gives me boundless strength and unshakable confidence. Later, I moved my bedding to his dormitory, lived with him, and studied your brilliant works together, finally making him return to your revolutionary line.

	Dear Chairman Mao! You recently taught us: "Whether to protect or suppress the broad masses of the people is the fundamental difference between the Communist Party and the Kuomintang, the fundamental difference between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, and the fundamental difference between proletarian dictatorship and bourgeois dictatorship." The attitude towards the broad masses of the people has always been the dividing line between revolution and counter-revolution, and the fundamental mark distinguishing the proletarian revolutionary line from the bourgeois reactionary line. Your latest instructions are the guiding light for us to carry out your revolutionary line. I will definitely "completely" and "thoroughly" implement your latest instructions, firmly believe in the masses, protect the masses, and stand together with the broad revolutionary masses, launching an unceasing attack on a handful of diehard capitalist-roaders, traitors, spies, and unrepentant landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, and fight to the end for the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

    发扬我党密切联系群众的优良作风
    济南部队活学活用毛泽东思想积极分子、某部后勤处长　孙乐义
    发了芽的榆树，雨露滋润更茂盛；孩子见了母亲，怎么能不亲近。敬爱的毛主席啊！忠于您的战士见了您，怎么能抑制住内心无比激动、无比幸福的感情！涌在我们心头的千言万语，并成一句话：毛主席万岁！毛主席万万岁！
    敬爱的毛主席啊！四十七年来，是您领导我们克服了革命道路上的千难万险，取得了一个又一个的胜利！是您亲自培育了我们党密切联系群众的优良作风。您最相信群众，最关心群众，最尊重群众的革命首创精神。您的革命路线就是最彻底的群众路线。捍卫您的革命路线，就是要保护群众，就是要保护群众的革命精神。在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，您发出了“人民解放军应该支持左派广大群众”的战斗号令，这是您对无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众的最大关心，最大爱护。我坚决执行您的伟大指示，深入“三支”、“两军”第一线，向广大革命人民群众宣传您的光辉思想，为捍卫您的无产阶级革命路线，和他们战斗在一起，胜利在一起。在一个工厂支左时，我坚决支持无产阶级革命派，按照您的伟大教导：“思想改造的工作是长期的、耐心的、细致的工作”，去做受蒙蔽群众的思想工作。开始，有的受蒙蔽的群众不理我，我就走上门去宣传您的最新指示，碰了钉子也不灰心。有一个工人受了蒙蔽，我先后找他谈了八次，还不见效果。怎么办？毛主席啊，困难的时候想起您，我就感到力量无穷，信心百倍。后来我把铺盖搬到他的宿舍，和他住在一起，和他一起学习您的光辉著作，终于使他回到了您的革命路线上来。
    敬爱的毛主席啊！您最近又教导我们：“对广大人民群众是保护还是镇压，是共产党同国民党的根本区别，是无产阶级同资产阶级的根本区别，是无产阶级专政同资产阶级专政的根本区别。”对广大人民群众抱什么态度，历来就是革命和反革命的分水岭，是区别无产阶级革命路线和资产阶级反动路线的根本标志。您的最新指示，是我们贯彻执行您的革命路线的指路明灯。我一定“完全”“彻底”落实您的最新指示，坚决相信群众，保护群众，誓同广大革命群众站在一起，对准一小撮顽固不化的走资派、叛徒、特务以及没有改造好的地、富、反、坏、右分子，展开不停顿的进攻，为夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利而奋斗到底！
