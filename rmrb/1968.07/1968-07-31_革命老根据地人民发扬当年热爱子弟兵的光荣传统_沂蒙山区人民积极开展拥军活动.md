The revolutionary people of the old revolutionary base area of Yimeng Mountains are carrying forward the glorious tradition of loving the soldiers from the past, and are actively conducting support-the-army activities. They firmly believe in and rely on the People's Liberation Army, wholeheartedly support and assist the People's Liberation Army, and learn from the People's Liberation Army with strong class feelings. Many units have formulated "support-the-army pacts" and launched "support-the-army weeks" and "support-the-army months" activities, further strengthening the relationship between the military and the people.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, July 29th, the revolutionary people of the old revolutionary base area of Yimeng Mountains, following Chairman Mao's great teaching of "support the army and love the people," have carried forward the glorious tradition of loving the soldiers from the past during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and have launched a large-scale support-the-army activity. They firmly believe in and rely on the People's Liberation Army, wholeheartedly support and assist the People's Liberation Army, and learn from the People's Liberation Army with strong class feelings, pushing the support-the-army activity to a new high.

During the Anti-Japanese War and the War of Liberation, the heroic revolutionary people of Yimeng Mountains had already established a deep bond of affection with their own soldiers. During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the People's Liberation Army responded to Chairman Mao's call to "support the leftist broad masses," and came to Yimeng Mountains again. The military and the people studied Chairman Mao Zedong Thought together, criticized China's Khrushchev and his agents together, and defended Chairman Mao's revolutionary line together. The people of Yimeng Mountains welcomed the soldiers as they had welcomed the "old Eighth Route Army" in the past. Many old militia members who had actively participated in "supporting the front" and poor old women who had sheltered the soldiers, upon hearing that the soldiers were coming to the village, spread the news and rushed to greet them from several miles away. The women in the village, like the "literacy classes" of the past, competed to wash the soldiers' clothes and blankets, and mend their shoes and socks. The deep affection of the revolutionary people of the old base area for the soldiers greatly encouraged the "support the left" and "support the agriculture" soldiers of the People's Liberation Army. They excitedly said, "Entering Yimeng Mountains is like coming home!"

The people of Yimeng Mountains, following Chairman Mao's great teaching of "the whole nation should learn from the People's Liberation Army," have taken the People's Liberation Army as a shining example in the support-the-army activities, finding the gaps and taking measures, actively carrying out the "three loyalties" activities of being loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. The revolutionary committees at all levels have put the study, propaganda, implementation, and defense of Mao Zedong Thought and Chairman Mao's latest instructions in the first place in all work. Many revolutionary committees also, like the People's Liberation Army, often send Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams to remote mountainous areas, closely link with the masses, spread Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and help revolutionary masses hold Mao Zedong Thought study classes. At present, Mao Zedong Thought is widely popularized in Yimeng Mountains, Chairman Mao's latest instructions are known to every household, and deeply rooted in people's hearts. Under the leadership of the representatives of the People's Liberation Army, many members of the revolutionary committees have seriously studied the revolutionary nature, scientific nature, and organizational discipline of the People's Liberation Army, learned from the People's Liberation Army's insistence on the "four firsts" and the "three-eighths" spirit. The revolutionary committees have taken the learning of the fine traditions of the People's Liberation Army as an important content of seriously transforming their style of work. Many members of the revolutionary committees have come to the martyrs' cemetery or places where revolutionary forerunners fought, invited soldiers and old militia members who participated in the battles to tell the history of revolutionary struggles, and had hardship meals with the representatives of the People's Liberation Army. Everyone expressed their determination to inherit and carry forward the fine traditions of the People's Liberation Army, and build the revolutionary committees into battle command posts that lead the broad revolutionary masses to take the initiative to attack the class enemies.

The broad revolutionary masses and poor and lower-middle peasants of Yimeng Mountains have also actively learned from the People's Liberation Army's good experiences and good learning style of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought through "support-the-army meetings," "military-civilian lectures," heart-to-heart talks, and experience exchange meetings, strengthening the relationship between the military and the people, and promoting their own thought revolutionization.

The revolutionary people of the old base area of Yimeng Mountains, while learning from the People's Liberation Army, have actively and proactively supported and assisted the People's Liberation Army in doing a good job of the "three supports" and "two militaries." At every critical moment in the development of the movement, many members of the revolutionary committees often analyze the new situation, new trends, and new characteristics of class struggle with the People's Liberation Army, and many revolutionary mass organizations and old poor and lower-middle peasants often report the situation of class struggle in their local areas to the People's Liberation Army. The military and the people work together to closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions. Many places' old poor and lower-middle peasants, old militia members, old Party members, and old cadres have voluntarily told the soldiers the history of revolutionary struggles, village history, and family history of the people of the old areas, recalling bitterness and sweetness, giving the soldiers a class struggle and two-line struggle education, and promoting the thought revolutionization of the soldiers.

During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the broad revolutionary masses of Yimeng Mountains have had a deeper understanding of Chairman Mao's great teaching of "without a people's army, there is nothing for the people." Many units have formulated "support-the-army pacts" and launched "support-the-army weeks" and "support-the-army months" activities, often checking and implementing the execution of the "support-the-army pacts," making the support-the-army activities established on a more conscious and solid ideological foundation.

    据新华社济南二十九日电　革命老根据地沂蒙山区革命人民，遵照毛主席“拥军爱民”的伟大教导，在无产阶级文化大革命中发扬当年热爱子弟兵的光荣传统，更大规模地展开了热烈的拥军活动。他们坚定不移地相信和依靠人民解放军，满腔热情地支持和帮助人民解放军，带着强烈的阶级感情学习人民解放军，把拥军活动推向一个新的高潮。
    早在抗日战争和解放战争时期，英雄的沂蒙山区革命人民，就和自己的子弟兵结下了深厚的鱼水之情。在无产阶级文化大革命中，人民解放军响应毛主席“人民解放军应该支持左派广大群众”的伟大号召，又来到了沂蒙山区。军民共同学习毛泽东思想，共同批判中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人，共同捍卫毛主席的革命路线。沂蒙山区人民象欢迎当年的“老八路”一样，欢迎解放军。许多当年积极参加“支前”的老民兵和掩护过子弟兵的贫农老大娘，一听说解放军要进村，奔走相告，跑到几里外迎接。村里的妇女们，也象当年的“识字班”一样，争着给解放军洗衣被，补鞋袜。革命老根据地人民对解放军的深情厚谊，极大地鼓舞了“支左”“支农”的解放军。他们激动地说：“踏进沂蒙山，就象到了自己的家！”
    沂蒙山区人民遵照毛主席“全国学人民解放军”的伟大教导，在拥军活动中，以解放军为光辉榜样，找差距，订措施，积极开展忠于毛主席、忠于毛泽东思想、忠于毛主席革命路线的“三忠于”活动。各级革委会把学习、宣传、执行、捍卫毛泽东思想和毛主席的最新指示，放在一切工作的首位。许多革委会还象解放军那样，经常派出毛泽东思想宣传队，深入偏僻的山区，密切联系群众，传播毛主席的最新指示，帮助革命群众举办毛泽东思想学习班。目前，在沂蒙山区，毛泽东思想空前大普及，毛主席最新指示家喻户晓，深入人心。在解放军代表的带动下，许多革委会成员，认真学习解放军的革命性、科学性和组织纪律性，学习解放军坚持四个第一，大兴三八作风。革委会把学习解放军的优良传统，作为认真转变作风的一项重要内容。许多革委会成员来到烈士陵园或革命前辈战斗过的地方，请参加过战斗的解放军指战员和老民兵讲述革命斗争史，跟解放军代表一起吃忆苦饭。大家表示，一定要继承和发扬解放军的优良传统，把革委会建设成为带领广大革命群众向阶级敌人主动进攻的战斗指挥部。沂蒙山区广大无产阶级革命派和贫下中农，还通过“拥军会”、“军民讲用会”、谈心会和经验交流会等方式，积极学习解放军活学活用毛泽东思想的好经验、好学风，密切了军民关系，有力地促进了自己的思想革命化。
    沂蒙山区革命老根据地人民，在学习解放军的同时，积极主动地支持和帮助人民解放军做好“三支”“两军”工作。在运动发展的每一个关键时刻，许多革委会成员经常与解放军一起分析阶级斗争的新形势、新动向、新特点，许多革命群众组织和老贫下中农经常向解放军反映本地阶级斗争的情况，军民齐心协力紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，落实毛主席的最新指示。许多地方的老贫下中农、老民兵、老党员、老干部，主动地给部队讲老区人民的革命斗争史、村史、家史，忆苦思甜，使部队同志受到了阶级斗争和两条路线斗争教育，促进了部队同志的思想革命化。
    在无产阶级文化大革命中，沂蒙山区广大革命群众对于毛主席的“没有一个人民的军队，便没有人民的一切”的伟大教导，有了更加深刻的理解。许多单位纷纷制订“拥军公约”，开展“拥军周”、“拥军月”活动，经常检查和落实“拥军公约”的执行情况，使拥军活动建立在更加自觉、更加坚实的思想基础上。
