Editor's Note: How can the Revolutionary Committee carry forward the Party's style of maintaining close ties with the masses? The report from Xiaoqing River Navigation Bureau provides an important enlightenment.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "We have the weapon of criticism and self-criticism which is Marxism-Leninism. We can get rid of bad work styles and maintain good work styles."

Good work styles are established in the struggle against bad work styles. Against the old work style of the exploiting class that stands above the masses and is detached from them, especially the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of China's Khrushchov that is detached from the masses and suppresses the masses, if we are not vigilant, it may take effect in the minds of some of our comrades, and sometimes it may unknowingly infiltrate our healthy body. Members of the Revolutionary Committee must carry forward the Party's style of maintaining close ties with the masses, and must not for a moment relax the struggle to eliminate bourgeois ideas and promote proletarian ideas in their minds.

This struggle is not something that can be effective by closing the door and "reflecting in seclusion." A member of the Revolutionary Committee is either closely linked with the masses, acting as a student of the masses and a servant of the masses; or detached from the masses, standing above the masses, acting as an official and a lord. The masses are the best witnesses. The criticism and supervision of the broad revolutionary masses are an important guarantee for the members of the Revolutionary Committee to maintain close ties with the masses and achieve ideological revolutionization.

They Are Ordinary Members of the Masses
—Recording the Revolutionary Committee of Shandong Province's Xiaoqing River Navigation Bureau That Is United with the Masses as One

Great Leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "The most fundamental thing in the reform of state organs is to maintain close ties with the masses."

We visited a leadership cadre in the suburbs of Jinan City that maintains close ties with the masses—the Revolutionary Committee of Shandong Province's Xiaoqing River Navigation Bureau. The masses go to the Revolutionary Committee "as if they are going home."

The place where the Revolutionary Committee of Xiaoqing River Navigation Bureau is located is the same place where the original bureau office was. In the past, the bureau had a large administrative apparatus with more than 130 people, and there were too many people for too few jobs. After the Revolutionary Committee was established, it implemented a policy of streamlining and downsizing, and the bureau office was reduced to only about ten people, who are not often at home and spend most of their time on the ships, docks, and construction sites.

Here, not only is there no hierarchical administrative structure, but it is also difficult to distinguish who is an "official" and who is a "common person." Are you looking for the responsible person of the Revolutionary Committee? Where there are masses, where the battle is the most intense, where it is the most difficult, that is where you should go to find them!

When we visited the Navigation Bureau, we saw a shipworker, about 35 or 36 years old, who had just finished setting up beds and moving bedding for new shipworkers in the training class, and was helping other shipworkers repair a leaking house. This person is Guo Puhua, the deputy director of the Revolutionary Committee of Xiaoqing River Navigation Bureau and a member of the Communist Party.

Guo Puhua was talking to us, and people kept coming to greet him. When it was time to eat, he squatted with the shipworkers; soon he appeared in the crowd erecting a large sign with Chairman Mao's quotations. People told us: Old Guo was a worker in the past and is still a worker now. He loves labor and cannot sit still.

In the past, a small group of capitalist roaders in Xiaoqing River Navigation Bureau acted as officials and lords, looking down on the shipworkers who pulled the boats. The Navigation Bureau's gate was right next to the river port, where many ships returning from voyages were often moored. The capitalist roaders saw them as if they were "strangers." Therefore, in the eyes of the shipworkers, the Navigation Bureau was like a "yamen," and they would not come unless they had something important to do. Now, things are completely different. When the masses have any opinions or problems, they come to the Revolutionary Committee immediately. Every time the shipworkers return from a voyage and moor the ship, they happily run to the Revolutionary Committee. When they see Old Guo, they always ask about the latest instructions from Chairman Mao, ask about the revolutionary and production situation of the bureau, reflect on the situation and problems on their own ship, talk about what is on their minds, or give Old Guo a few instructions. Some people even take the time to come and clean the place with the comrades of the Revolutionary Committee or repair the house. The shipworkers said: "Coming here is like coming home, this is our Revolutionary Committee!"

The comrades of the Revolutionary Committee said: Fish cannot live without water, and we cannot work without the masses. We are always students of the masses. The workers saw that their representatives firmly implemented Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and happily said: With Chairman Mao leading us from above and the Revolutionary Committee leading us from below, we will definitely be able to do a good job in revolution and production, and definitely be able to turn Xiaoqing River into a school of Mao Zedong Thought! Be Willing to Be Students of the Masses

They have achieved this step through struggle.

The Revolutionary Committee of Xiaoqing River Navigation Bureau was established, and how should the members of the Revolutionary Committee maintain close ties with the masses? They must answer this question with actions.

At the beginning, some comrades did not seriously think about this problem according to Mao Zedong Thought, and unconsciously assumed the "posture" of a leading cadre. Some people liked to talk a lot in front of the masses; some people worked with the workers, as if it was not their duty, thinking that working for a week or two days was enough...

The workers' hearts are the reddest, and their eyes are the brightest. They saw the changes in some members of the Revolutionary Committee and were very worried. They were concerned that their representatives might take the wrong path of revisionism, although these were just signs, they could not be ignored!

On the evening of the Spring Festival this year, five or six old shipworkers barged into the duty room of the Revolutionary Committee and found Guo Puhua. Sun Xiangji, who had deep hatred for the old society, said with tears in his eyes: "Pu Hua, this place of Xiaoqing River is not easy to come by!" Guo Puhua was taken aback for a moment. The old shipworker continued: "When Jinan was liberated, how many revolutionary forerunners rushed up along Xiaoqing River, and the water of Xiaoqing River was dyed red. Xiaoqing River was liberated by Chairman Mao, and it was the blood and sacrifice of revolutionary forerunners. Today, we must hold power according to Mao Zedong Thought! We must not take the wrong path, and we must fight for Chairman Mao!" The old shipworkers, with deep class feelings, pointed out the phenomenon of some members of the Revolutionary Committee being detached from the masses. They said that if this problem is not paid attention to, it will slide down the old path of the capitalist roaders.

Guo Puhua, who had begged for food in the old society and rolled with the shipworkers of Xiaoqing River for more than 20 years, had unlimited love for Chairman Mao and was extremely close to his class brothers. He thought about the old shipworkers' words from the bottom of their hearts and thought about the situation of the Revolutionary Committee since its establishment, realizing that there was indeed a big problem of which path to take. He quickly organized the members of the Revolutionary Committee to repeatedly study Chairman Mao's teachings: "We Communists are not to be officials, but to make revolution. We must all have thorough revolutionary spirit. We must not for a moment be detached from the masses." They discussed the process of a small group of capitalist roaders within the Party degenerating and transforming, deeply realizing that the issue of style is not a small issue, but a big issue of whether to implement Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. They decided to open the door for rectification.

The masses were very concerned about the rectification of the Revolutionary Committee, saying that this was a matter of where the Revolutionary Committee was going. Some masses ran many miles to come and give their opinions, and some ship teams had just returned from a voyage, and the shipworkers came to participate in the rectification meeting. At the rectification meeting, the masses gave both sincere and sharp criticism to some members of the Revolutionary Committee. They said: "You are the representatives of more than 1,800 of us. We selected you to listen to Chairman Mao's words, to hold power for the people and use it well, to lead us in continuous revolution. You must think carefully about whether you are following Chairman Mao and whether you are united with the masses!" "You must be sober, you are ordinary members of the workers, do not think that because we selected you as representatives, you are higher than the masses, and arrange yourself to be an 'official'." "We selected you as representatives, and we support you, supporting Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. We hope you listen to Chairman Mao's words and do not for a moment be detached from the masses."

The masses' piercing criticism touched the souls of some members of the Revolutionary Committee, and they received profound education. Some comrades were criticized to the point of sweating profusely. They checked themselves, saying that the fundamental problem was that the word "official" was playing tricks in their minds. This "official" is the ideology of the exploiting class and the poison of China's Khrushchov. The members of the Revolutionary Committee severely criticized China's Khrushchov's theory of "joining the Party to be an official" and severely criticized the theory of "rebelling to be an official" spread by the class enemy; they criticized the bourgeois ideas of fame and wealth to the point of stinking. They realized that being an official or a servant of the people is a fundamental issue of stance. They brought this issue to study the "Three Articles" thoroughly, letting the idea of serving the people wholeheartedly take deep root in their minds. In order to further accept the criticism and supervision of the masses, the members of the Revolutionary Committee actively went to the ship teams, docks, and shipyards to meet with the masses and engage in self-criticism and criticism of revisionism among the masses. The Revolutionary Committee also, according to the opinions of the masses, carried out a thorough reform of the originally overlapping bureau apparatus. The committee members resolutely went to the ship teams, docks, shipyards, and construction sites to work among the masses, to study, fight, and work with the masses, to serve the masses, and to be students of the masses. "The Masses Are the Real Heroes"

Some members of the Revolutionary Committee originally had the idea: they were "old rebels," and their revolution had always been at the forefront. They had a deeper understanding of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line than the masses. Obviously, they had not yet truly understood Chairman Mao's teaching that "the masses are the real heroes." They went deep into the masses and received profound education.

The shipworkers on Xiaoqing River, after studying Chairman Mao's brilliant "May 7th Directive," decided to turn the ship team into both a work team and a propaganda team, just like the PLA. They connected with the production teams on both banks of Xiaoqing River and used the gaps during mid-voyage stops to go to the countryside to propagate Mao Zedong Thought, to read Chairman Mao's quotations with the farmers, to sing songs of Chairman Mao's quotations, to engage in self-criticism and criticism of revisionism, and to carry out revolutionary criticism and struggle. The farmers on both banks of Xiaoqing River praised: "These ship teams are transportation teams and also propaganda teams of Mao Zedong Thought, 'red when walking, red when staying'."

Not long ago, the 15th barge team accepted the task of transporting bricks from Guangrao to Shouguang. At that time, it was the wheat harvest season, and there were no laborers on the port. According to the usual practice, the shipworkers did not handle the loading and unloading. The comrades of the barge team, in accordance with Chairman Mao's teaching of "completely" and "thoroughly" serving the people, took the initiative to load the bricks onto the ship themselves. Afterward, the consignor sent the loading fee. How should these funds be handled? The team leader let the workers discuss it. The workers said that it should be turned over to the state. They also held a criticism meeting on this matter, severely criticizing the revisionist goods of "material incentive" and "bonus as the key" promoted by China's Khrushchov.

In May of this year, the bureau needed to repair a cement barge, which required renting a crane, but it would cost 18 or 19 yuan per hour. The Revolutionary Committee was hesitant. The workers of Huangtai Port heard about it and, in accordance with Chairman Mao's teaching of "frugality for revolution," thought of ways to use the discarded slope machine and installed the cement barge in one day.

The members of the Revolutionary Committee saw with their own eyes that the masses did many things more thoughtfully than they did, and some things were even things they had not thought of. They saw that the masses were the most loyal to Chairman Mao, the most serious in executing Chairman Mao's instructions, the most hateful of China's Khrushchov's counter-revolutionary revisionist line, the most decisive and thorough in carrying out the revolution, the most brave, wise, and powerful in fighting against class enemies, the most able to overcome difficulties and find ways to grasp revolution and promote production...

They saw the wisdom of the masses and the power of the masses, and truly understood the truth that "the masses are the real heroes." They overcame the wrong ideas of thinking themselves superior and thinking their merits were great, and became more respectful and trusting of the masses. They no longer regarded themselves as leaders in front of the masses and further straightened out the relationship between the individual and the masses. Deputy Director of the Revolutionary Committee Guo Puhua sighed: "For our unit, these more than a thousand workers are the real leaders. We must always learn from them, and we are always students."

"What Is Leadership?"
The committee members of the Revolutionary Committee have a new understanding of what leadership is. They said: "Leadership is not pointing fingers and gesturing, nor is it being an official and a lord; leadership is to be infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, to strive to study and apply Mao Zedong Thought, to be a servant of the people; leadership is to maintain close ties with the masses, to come from the masses and go to the masses." They truly understood the relationship between leadership and the masses and wholeheartedly thought about what the masses thought and urgently did what the masses urgently needed.

The masses were eager to study Mao Zedong Thought, and they held various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes. They took the lead in studying, executing, propagating, and defending Mao Zedong Thought as their most fundamental task. Every time Chairman Mao's latest instructions were issued, they always transmitted them to the masses with the fastest speed and the most accurate manner, and discussed and executed them seriously with the masses. They felt that this was the best service to the masses and was the most basic duty of a leader. One night, Chairman Mao's latest instructions on the correct handling of cadre issues were transmitted to the Revolutionary Committee. The shipworkers were scattered along the 400-mile transportation line of Xiaoqing River, so how could Chairman Mao's voice be quickly transmitted throughout Xiaoqing River? Two standing committee members of the Revolutionary Committee immediately rode bicycles along the banks of Xiaoqing River to transmit the instructions to each ship.

Xiaoqing River Navigation Bureau has a shipyard, and the masses urgently requested to thoroughly expose the long-covered lid of class struggle. The comrades of the Revolutionary Committee brought this problem to the masses of the shipyard, studied and worked with the workers, conducted investigations and research, and analyzed the enemy situation together, finally exposing a traitor who had been hidden for a long time and other class enemies.

In late November of last year, the ship team was sailing on the snow-covered Xiaoqing River, and the temperature suddenly dropped, with the ships facing the danger of being frozen in the water at any time. At this critical moment, the members of the Revolutionary Committee were often on the ships with the shipworkers breaking the ice and sailing. In May of this year, due to drought and shallow water, the barges often ran aground. At this time, the members of the Revolutionary Committee often pulled the ships with the workers. Along the long waterway of Xiaoqing River, wherever it was the most difficult and dangerous, there they were.

The members of the Revolutionary Committee went deep into the masses, understanding more about the lives and thoughts of the masses, and caring for them more promptly. They built new houses with their own hands, letting the elderly shipworkers who had lived in the ship cabin all year long move in. They actively helped the families of the shipworkers who went out on voyages to treat their illnesses. For some ships that had been out on voyages for a long time, they were afraid of running out of grain and coal, so they actively sent supplies. The shipworkers excitedly said: "Their hearts are stuck to ours, and their sweat flows with ours. They are good servants of the people!"

The more the masses of Xiaoqing River Navigation Bureau supported the Revolutionary Committee, the more the comrades of the Revolutionary Committee paid attention to not being detached from the masses, the more they humbly listened to the opinions and criticisms of the masses, and the more they consulted with the masses on every matter. They said: Mao Zedong Thought illuminates our path forward, and the masses supervise our progress. Our hearts are forever loyal to Chairman Mao, and our eyes are forever on the masses.

专栏：

    编者按：革委会怎样才能发扬党的紧密联系群众的作风？小清河航运局的报道，给人一个很重要的启示。
    毛主席教导我们说：“我们有批评和自我批评这个马克思列宁主义的武器。我们能够去掉不良作风，保持优良作风。”
    好的作风是在同坏的作风作斗争中树立起来的。对剥削阶级高高在上、脱离群众的旧作风，特别是中国赫鲁晓夫一套脱离群众、镇压群众的反革命修正主义路线的流毒，如果不警惕，就有可能在我们某些同志头脑中发生作用，有时可能不知不觉地侵入我们的健康肌体。革委会的成员要发扬党的紧密联系群众的作风，就必须在自己的头脑里一时一刻也不放松灭资兴无的斗争。
      这种斗争，决不是关起门来，“闭门思过”能够奏效的。一个革委会的成员，是紧密地联系群众，当群众的小学生，做群众的勤务员；还是脱离群众，高踞于群众之上，做官当老爷，群众是最好的见证人。广大革命群众的批评和监督，是革委会成员紧密联系群众，实现思想革命化的重要保证。
    他们是群众中普通一员
    ——记同群众血肉相连的山东省小清河航运局革命委员会
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“国家机关的改革，最根本的一条，就是联系群众。”
    我们在济南市郊访问了一个同群众保持血肉联系的领导班子——山东省小清河航运局革命委员会。群众到革委会“就象到家一样”
    小清河航运局革委会所在的地方，就是原来航运局机关办公的地方。过去，局机关行政机构庞大，一百三十多人，人浮于事。革委会成立以后，实行了精兵简政，局机关只剩下十来个人，也不常在家，多数时间跑船队、码头和工地。
    在这里，不仅看不到层次重叠的行政机构，也分不清谁是“官”，谁是“老百姓”。你要找革委会的负责人吗？那里有群众，那里战斗最紧张，那里最艰苦，就到那里去找吧！
    我们到航运局访问的时候，只见一个约有三十五六岁的船工，刚给新来学习班的船工搭好床铺，搬齐被褥，又同另一些船工翻修漏雨的房子。这个人就是小清河航运局革委会的副主任、共产党员郭丕华。
    郭丕华同我们说着话，不断有人前来向他打招呼。吃饭的时候，他同船工们蹲在一起；一会儿又出现在街上栽竖巨大的毛主席语录牌的人群中。人们告诉我们：老郭过去是工人，现在还是个工人，爱劳动，闲不住。
    过去，小清河航运局里一小撮走资派当官做老爷，瞧不起拉纤的船工。航运局门口就是河港码头，常有许多出航归来的船只停泊在那里，走资派见了象是“路人”。因此，过去在船工眼里，航运局就象个“衙门”，他们是“无事不登三宝殿”的。现在，可大不相同了。群众有什么意见，有什么问题，马上就来找革委会。船工们每当出航归来，把船停下，就高高兴兴地向革委会跑。他们见了老郭，总是问问毛主席有什么最新指示，问问局里的革命和生产形势，反映一下自己船上的情况和问题，说说自己的心里话，或者嘱咐老郭几句。有的人还特意抽空来同革委会的同志一起打扫卫生，或者修理房子。船工们说：“来到这里，就象到家一样，这是俺们的革委会！”
    革委会的同志们说：鱼儿离开了水不能活，我们离开群众就没法工作，我们啥时候也是群众的小学生。工人们看到自己选出的代表坚决贯彻毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，高兴地说：上有毛主席给我们引路，下有革委会给我们带队，我们一定能把革命和生产搞好，一定能把小清河办成毛泽东思想大学校！甘当群众的小学生
    他们做到这一步，也是经过斗争的。
    小清河航运局革命委员会成立了，革委会成员怎样同群众保持紧密的联系呢？他们必须及时用行动来回答这个问题。
    开始，有的同志没有按照毛泽东思想认真地思索这个问题，以为自己的地位与过去不同了，就自觉不自觉地摆起领导干部的“架子”。有的人在群众面前，喜欢哇啦哇啦讲一顿；有的人同工人一起干活，好象已不是本分，以为一个星期干一两天就可以了，……
    工人们心最红，眼最亮，他们看到革委会有的成员身上的这些变化，心中非常着急。他们担心自己选出的代表可能走上修正主义的邪路，虽然是一些苗头，也不能不管啊！
    今年春节晚上，五、六个老船工闯进了革委会值班室，找到了郭丕华。在旧社会里苦大仇深的老船工孙相纪，含着泪花激动地说：“丕华呀！小清河这个地方可来的不易啊！”郭丕华乍一听有些发楞。老船工继续说：“解放济南的时候，多少革命前辈顺着小清河冲上去，小清河的水都染红了。小清河是毛主席解放的，是革命前辈流血牺牲换来的。今天咱们可要按照毛泽东思想掌好权啊！千万不能走邪道，要为毛主席争气啊！”老船工们满怀着深厚的阶级感情，指出革委会有的成员脱离群众的现象。他们说，这个问题如果不注意，就会沿着走资派的老路滑下去。
    在旧社会讨过饭、同小清河的船工们一起滚了二十多年的郭丕华，对毛主席无限热爱，对阶级兄弟无比地亲。他想了想老船工出自肺腑的话，又想了想革委会成立以来的情况，觉察到确实存在着走什么路的大问题。他火速组织革委会成员反复学习了毛主席的教导：“我们共产党人不是要做官，而是要革命，我们人人要有彻底的革命精神，我们不要有一时一刻脱离群众。”他们讨论了党内一小撮走资派蜕化变质的经过，深刻地认识到，作风问题不是小问题，是执行不执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的大问题。他们决定开门整风。
    群众非常关心革委会的整风，说这是关系到革委会向何处去的问题。有的群众跑了许多路赶来提意见，有的船队刚刚返航，船工们就来参加整风会。在整风会上，群众对革委会的一些成员提出了既恳切又尖锐的批评。他们说：“你们是我们一千八百多人选出的代表，我们选你们是要你们听毛主席的话，为人民掌好权用好权，率领我们不断革命。你们可要好好想一想是否紧跟毛主席，是否同群众心连心啊？！”“你们要清醒，你们是工人中的普通一员，不要因为大家选你们当代表，就自己觉得比群众高一头，自个把自个安排成当‘官’的。”“我们选你们做代表，我们拥护你们，是拥护毛主席的革命路线。希望你们听毛主席的话，不要有一时一刻脱离群众。”
    群众一针见血的批评，触及了革委会某些成员的灵魂，他们受到了深刻的教育。有的同志被批评得满头大汗。他们检查说，最根本的问题是“官”字在头脑里作怪。这个“官”字是剥削阶级的思想，是中国赫鲁晓夫的流毒。革委会成员狠批了中国赫鲁晓夫的
  “入党做官”论，狠批了阶级敌人散布的“造反当官”论；把资产阶级的名利思想批得臭臭的。他们认识到，当官还是当人民的勤务员，这是个根本立场问题。他们带着这个问题大学“老三篇”，让全心全意为人民服务的思想在头脑中牢牢扎根。为了进一步接受群众的批评和监督，革委会成员主动下到船队、码头、船厂，同群众见面，在群众中斗私批修。革委会还根据群众的意见，大刀阔斧地改革了原来机构重叠的局机关。委员们坚决下到船队、码头、船厂、工地，到群众中去办公，同群众一起学习、战斗和劳动，为群众服务，当群众的小学生。“群众是真正的英雄”
    革委会中有的成员，原来有种想法：自己是“老造反派”，革命一直跑在前边，对毛主席无产阶级革命路线的体会，比群众深。显然，他们还没有真正理解毛主席关于“群众是真正的英雄”的教导。他们深入到群众中去以后，才受到了深刻的教育。
    运行在小清河上的船工们，在学习了毛主席光辉的“五·七”指示以后，决定象解放军那样，把船队办成既是工作队，又是宣传队。他们同小清河两岸的生产队挂上钩，利用中途停泊休息的空隙，去农村宣传毛泽东思想，同农民一起读毛主席语录，一起唱毛主席语录歌，一起斗私批修，搞革命大批判。小清河两岸的许多农民称赞说：“这些船队是运输队，又是毛泽东思想宣传队，‘走起来红一线，住下来红一片’。”
    不久以前，十五驳船队接受了从广饶到寿光的运砖任务。当时，正值麦收，港上没有搬运工。按惯例，船工是不管装卸的。驳船队的工人同志们，遵照毛主席“完全”、“彻底”为人民服务的教导，自己动手，把砖装上了船。事后，托运单位送来了搬运费。这些钱怎么处理？船队队长让工人们讨论。工人们说，应当上交国家。他们还借此举行了批判会，狠批了中国赫鲁晓夫推行的“物质刺激”、“奖金挂帅”等修正主义黑货。
    今年五月间，局里要修水泥趸船，需要租一辆吊车，但是一小时就得花十八九元的租费，革委会踌躇不决。黄台港的工人们听说以后，遵照毛主席关于“要节约闹革命”的教导，想方设法利用废拉坡机，在一天的时间内安装起水泥趸船。
    革委会成员在下边亲眼看到，群众做的许多事情比他们想得周到，有的事情甚至是他们想也想不到的。他们看到群众对毛主席最忠，执行毛主席指示最认真，对中国赫鲁晓夫反革命修正主义路线最痛恨，搞起革命来最坚决、最彻底，对阶级敌人斗争最勇敢、最有智慧、最有力量，抓革命促生产最能克服困难、最有办法，……
    他们看到了群众的智慧，看到了群众的力量，就真正懂得了“群众是真正的英雄”的真理，就克服了自以为高明、自以为功劳大等错误想法，就变得更加尊重群众，信赖群众了，就不再在群众面前以领导者自居了，从而进一步摆正了个人同群众的关系。革委会副主任郭丕华感慨地说：“就我们这个单位来说，这一千多工人才是真正的领导。我们永远要向他们学习，我们永远是小学生。”“领导就要紧密联系群众”
    什么叫领导？革委会委员们有了一个新的理解。他们说：“领导绝不是指手划脚，绝不是当官做老爷；领导就要无限忠于毛主席，努力活学活用毛泽东思想，做人民的勤务员；领导就要紧密联系群众，从群众中来，到群众中去。”他们真正懂得了领导与群众的关系，就一心一意想群众之所想，急群众之所急。
    群众如饥似渴地想学习毛泽东思想，他们就大办各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班。他们把带头学习、执行、宣传和捍卫毛泽东思想，当作最根本的任务。每当毛主席的最新指示下达以后，他们总是以最快的速度，最准确地传达给群众，并和群众一起认真讨论，贯彻执行。他们觉得，这是对群众最好的服务，也是领导者的最基本的职责。一天深夜，毛主席关于正确对待干部问题的最新指示传到革委会。船工们都分散在小清河四百里长的运输线上，怎样迅速把毛主席的声音传遍整个小清河呢？革委会两个常委立即骑着自行车，顺着小清河岸去逐船作了传达。
    小清河航运局有个船厂，群众迫切要求把长期捂着的阶级斗争盖子彻底揭开。革委会的同志带着这个问题深入到船厂群众中去，和工人一块学习，一起劳动，并进行调查研究，共同分析敌情，终于把一个隐藏了很久的叛徒和其他阶级敌人揪了出来。
    去年十一月下旬，船队行驶在风雪弥漫的小清河上，气温骤然下降，船舶随时都有被封冻在水里的危险。在这样的时刻，革委会成员经常都在船上和船工们一起破冰开航。今年五月，小清河因天旱水浅，驳船经常搁浅。在这样的时候，革委会成员经常同工人一起背纤拉船。在小清河漫长的水运线上，那里最困难最危险，那里就有他们。
    革委会成员深入到群众之中，对群众生活、群众思想了解得多了，关心也更及时了。他们亲手盖起新房，让终年生活在船舱的老年船工搬进去住。他们主动地帮助出航船工的家属医治疾病。有的船只在外边出航久了，他们怕缺粮缺煤，就主动给送去。船工们激动地说：“他们的心和我们贴在一块，汗和我们流在一起，他们是人民的好勤务员！”
    小清河航运局的群众越是拥护革委会，革委会的同志们越是注意不脱离群众，越是虚心听取群众的意见和批评，越是遇事同群众商量。他们说：毛泽东思想照亮了我们前进的道路，群众监督着我们前进。我们的心永远忠于毛主席，我们的眼里永远要有群众。　　　本报通讯员、本报记者
