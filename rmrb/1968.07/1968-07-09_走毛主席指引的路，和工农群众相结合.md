Follow the path of uniting with workers and peasants,
Proactively go to the most arduous places

In August 1967, I graduated from the Yanbian Han Language Normal School in Tumen City. Before graduation, my sister wrote to me, asking me to inform the organization about our family's actual situation and try to be assigned to work in Yanji City. My sister's letter aligned with my thoughts at the time. My mother was over fifty years old and in poor health. Additionally, my mother loved me, and I was reluctant to leave her. However, if I were to request this from the organization, I feared my classmates would say I talked one way but acted another, which would be embarrassing. If I didn't request it, I felt like there was always something on my mind. Fortunately, during the graduation assignment, I was assigned to work at the Gonghe Primary School in Yanji City. Since this aligned with my wishes, I immediately expressed my willingness to "obey the organization's assignment."

After arriving at Gonghe Primary School, it was during the decisive victory of the Cultural Revolution, and a vigorous revolutionary criticism campaign was underway. The school's revolutionary teachers and students were criticizing the fallacies of "exploitation is meritorious" and "public-private integration" promoted by the Chinese Khrushchev. Comrades angrily said, "The Chinese Khrushchev advocates 'exploitation is meritorious' and 'public-private integration,' aiming to make us retrace our steps and suffer twice. This is absolutely unacceptable! Chairman Mao saved us, and we will never forget our roots!" The comrades' words deeply moved me. On my way home, I thought: if a person forgets their roots, they will degenerate and deviate from Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Have I forgotten my roots? That night, I studied Chairman Mao's works. Chairman Mao said, "Many people are irresponsible in their work, shirking difficulties and pushing heavy burdens onto others while taking on light tasks. When faced with a task, they first think of themselves and then of others. ... Such people are not communists, at least not pure communists." These words struck my "selfish" core, and my face flushed with shame. I felt that in the matter of job assignment, I had selfish thoughts. Although I did not request the organization to assign me to Yanji City, I had the idea of hoping the organization would "consider" me. Why did I first think of myself when faced with a task? Wasn't this the "selfish" nature of the bourgeoisie at work? Could one with selfish thoughts not forget their roots? I looked up at the photograph of Chairman Mao beckoning to us, and countless memories flooded my mind. In the old society, my father was deceived by human traffickers and sold to the "woodcutters" to do hard labor, living a life worse than cattle under the Japanese invaders' whips. When I was just three months old, my mother suddenly fell seriously ill, and it was Chairman Mao who sent the Eighth Route Army to save her; I had no milk to drink, and it was the Eighth Route Army who fed me mouthful by mouthful. Truly, parents' love is not as deep as Chairman Mao's love! I am a communist, and in the matter of job assignment, I first considered my personal interests rather than the needs of the party and the people. Wasn't this forgetting my roots? The more I thought, the more I felt I had been poisoned by the Chinese Khrushchev's "public-private integration" theory.

Recalling the latter half of 1966, when the great leader Chairman Mao received the Red Guards in Beijing, I had tears of happiness as I swore to Chairman Mao, "I will remain pure for life! I will be a good soldier of Chairman Mao forever!" Today, in the fierce struggle between the two classes, the two lines, and the two roads, how could I forget the teachings of the great leader Chairman Mao? I have made up my mind to follow Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and I will definitely follow the path indicated by Chairman Mao! An infinitely loyal revolutionary youth should take the lead in the face of hardships, how can personal interests bind one's body? Therefore, I told my mother, "I want to go to the most arduous and remote places, I want to go to the countryside, not stay in Yanji City." At first, she thought I was joking, but later, when she knew it was true, she hurriedly said, "Some people request to return home or to the city, why are you so stubborn!" I felt that I was indeed stubborn, stubborn against the "selfish" nature. I said, "Mom, we can't compare with others, we must listen to Chairman Mao's words, knowledge youth going to the countryside, this is Chairman Mao's words." I recited a passage from Chairman Mao's quotations to my mother: "All those who can go to the countryside to work should go there happily. The countryside is a vast world where one can achieve great things." Then I said to my mother, "Although I was born into a poor family, grew up in the new society, and under the red flag, I have never left the city, never suffered hardships, and never been tempered. Shouldn't someone like me go to the countryside to unite with the workers and peasants, temper and transform oneself? We must listen to Chairman Mao's words!" My mother's heart was moved, and seeing that she did not stop me, I happily went to the provincial personnel department and requested to be assigned to the countryside. The personnel department comrades strongly supported my action and decided to transfer me to Antu County.

When I heard that I was going to Antu County, someone said to me, "The water and soil in Antu are not good, it is easy to get mountain sickness." I thought, if the water and soil are not good, they can be changed. People armed with Mao Zedong Thought are not afraid of anything. The people of Antu can farm there for the revolution, why can't I go there to work for the revolution? Intellectuals going to the countryside to serve the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants is Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. To defend Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, even if it means climbing mountains of knives and crossing seas of fire, I will forge ahead.

Upon arriving in Antu County, the county comrades asked me where I wanted to go. I said, "Wherever it is the most arduous, I will go there!" They recommended two schools for me to choose from: one was the Yangmucun Primary School in Xiaoshahe Commune, and the other was the Dongfanghong Primary School in Liangjiang Commune. They also introduced the situation of these two schools in detail: Yangmucun Primary School was near a bus station, with convenient transportation, and there were female teachers to accompany; Dongfanghong Primary School was over 200 miles away from the county, with only two bus trips per week, and the bus only went to the commune, with another 20 miles to the school. I firmly chose the Dongfanghong Primary School with the worse conditions. The county comrades said to me, "Your health is not very good, there are many difficulties there, can you persist?" I immediately replied, "Overcoming difficulties does not depend on the body, but on the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. With Mao Zedong Thought, any difficulty can be overcome; without Mao Zedong Thought, even the smallest difficulty cannot be overcome!" Thus, I followed Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, carrying Chairman Mao's works, happily came to the Dongfanghong Primary School under the Changbai Mountains in Liangjiang Commune.

Thoroughly transform one's worldview,
Plant one's roots deeply among the poor and lower-middle peasants

The Dongfanghong Production Brigade is located in a marshland at the foot of the Changbai Mountains. It is surrounded by mountains on three sides and water on one side. The mountain paths are narrow, and the branches of trees hit the faces of those walking behind. During the rainy season, the roads are muddy and difficult to traverse. Only in winter can vehicles pass. Because this brigade is located in the middle of the grasslands, mosquitoes and flies are particularly numerous. In summer, regardless of gender or age, everyone has to cover their heads with a white cloth. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants are conducting the great three-revolution movements in such an environment under the guidance of Chairman Mao.

When I first arrived in this place, I was unfamiliar with everything. Because the place is remote, few outsiders come, so the villagers all curiously looked at me. I didn't know whether to stand or sit. At night, I tossed and turned, unable to sleep. I wondered, why was I so reluctant to approach the masses? Why did I always feel a gap between my thoughts and feelings and those of the masses? Thinking of this, I began to study Chairman Mao's works. Chairman Mao said, "How do you judge whether a youth is revolutionary? What standard do you use? What do you use to distinguish them? There is only one standard, that is, whether they are willing and actually do unite with the broad masses of workers and peasants. Those who are willing and actually do unite with the workers and peasants are revolutionary; otherwise, they are not revolutionary or are counter-revolutionary." Chairman Mao's teachings made me realize that whether one can unite with the workers and peasants is the dividing line between revolution and counter-revolution, and it is the touchstone for measuring whether a youth is loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. An infinitely loyal revolutionary youth must resolutely carry out Chairman Mao's revolutionary line of uniting with the workers and peasants. Only by uniting with the workers and peasants can one engage in great revolutionary struggles; only by learning from the workers and peasants can one establish a worldview of wholeheartedly serving the people, and become a reliable successor to the proletarian revolutionary cause.

Chairman Mao taught us, "The transformation of one's worldview is a fundamental transformation." To achieve this, "one must change and transform one's thoughts and feelings. Without this change and transformation, nothing can be done well, everything will be out of place." I deeply felt that the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants were like my parents, suffering greatly in the old society, enduring immense hardships. They loved Chairman Mao, socialism, and the new countryside without bounds. I must unite with the poor and lower-middle peasants with all my heart, roll in the mud, step in cow dung, humbly learn from the poor and lower-middle peasants, and serve them wholeheartedly, planting my roots deeply among the poor and lower-middle peasants. With this understanding, I actively approached the poor and lower-middle peasants, gradually becoming familiar with them.

Winter arrived, and the villagers pulled small sleds up the mountain. The brigade's ox sleds also transported firewood to the villagers' homes in batches. I made two small sleds with another teacher. Going up the mountain to collect firewood was a first for me. The mountain was high, the snow was deep, and the mountain road was steep, with many difficulties. Chairman Mao said, "This army possesses an unyielding spirit, it will overcome all enemies and will never be subdued by enemies." Chairman Mao's teachings gave me boundless strength. I put on a fur hat, pulled the small sled, and faced the wind and snow of the Changbai Mountains, going up the mountain again and again.

A few days later, the villagers saw me going up the mountain early in the morning and kindly said, "Teacher Sun, you should rest! You can't collect much firewood, the brigade can pull some for you. In the past, teachers had the brigade pull firewood for them, even male villagers can't endure this, how can a woman do this at this time?" After hearing this, I indeed felt very tired and collected little firewood, thinking: the brigade pulling one sled is equivalent to me pulling six or seven times. Yes! Let the brigade pull for me! But when I returned to the house and saw the photograph of Chairman Mao smiling and beckoning to me, I recalled the happy scene of seeing Chairman Mao in Beijing and the sound of my oath to Chairman Mao echoed in my ears. Chairman Mao's earnest teachings surged in my heart: "You must let the masses understand you, you must unite with the masses, you must make a decision and undergo long-term, even painful, tempering." Norman Bethune was selfless and dedicated to others, how could I think of myself and let the brigade pull firewood for me? How could I be a good student of the masses? I felt that this was not a matter of one or two sleds of firewood, but a matter of whether to charge forward or retreat on the battlefield of fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism; whether to advance or escape difficulties on the path of ideological revolution; whether to let the imperialists and revisionists' plot to restore capitalism in the third or fourth generation in China completely fail, or to become the successor of the bourgeoisie. I am a youth nurtured by Mao Zedong Thought, and on the battlefield of fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism, I must charge forward without retreat.

To avoid affecting teaching, I still went up the mountain early in the morning. I went up the mountain in strong winds and heavy snow. When my clothes were torn, I mended them. When I fell, I got up again. My hands and feet were frozen and cracked, and my face was stung by the wind and snow, but my heart was tempered to be even redder. I felt that I was not just collecting firewood or pulling a sled, but following Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, fighting against "selfishness" and the Chinese Khrushchev on the path of revolution. In this way, not only did I solve my own firewood problem, but I also helped the production team pull firewood for the five-guarantee households and the poor households.

Chairman Mao taught us, "To ensure that our party and state do not change color, we need not only the correct line and policy but also to cultivate and train millions of successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause." "This is a matter of life and death for our party and state. It is a matter of great importance for the proletarian revolutionary cause for a hundred, a thousand, and ten thousand years." To achieve ideological revolution, truly roll in the mud, step in cow dung, plant one's roots among the masses, and become a good successor to the proletarian revolutionary cause, I taught during the day and went to the brigade at night to guide the militia and villagers in studying Chairman Mao's works, leading everyone to learn and sing songs praising the great leader Chairman Mao and songs of Chairman Mao's quotations. I also tried to find time to participate in the collective production labor of the production team. Whatever was hard, I did it. The militia members felled trees, and I also swung the axe to fell trees. It was indeed tiring, but the villagers were even more tired! My hands blistered, but the villagers' calluses on their hands were formed from countless blisters! Chairman Mao taught us to undergo long-term, even painful, tempering to truly unite with the workers and peasants and to transform our thoughts and feelings.

Chairman Mao taught us, "We communists are like seeds, and the people are like the land. When we go to a place, we must unite with the local people, take root, blossom, and bear fruit among the people." In the process of uniting with the poor and lower-middle peasants, the poor and lower-middle peasants are all my teachers. Politically, they helped me raise my class struggle consciousness and two-line struggle consciousness. They taught me production and labor, helping me accelerate my ideological revolution; in life, they cared for me like parents care for their children, making my class feelings with the poor and lower-middle peasants deeper and tighter; I also truly regarded the poor and lower-middle peasants as my parents, considering their needs as my own, and their sufferings as my own. Five-guarantee household Li Chunyang, in the old society, like my father, suffered greatly. I regarded him as my own father. With no one to take care of him at home, I took the initiative to take care of him. When his clothes were dirty, I washed them for him. When his hair was long, I cut it for him. When the team was busy, I didn't have time to pull firewood for him, so I went up the mountain to collect firewood for him. Whenever I had time, I asked Old Grandpa to tell me about his family history and the bitter history of the old society, recalling the bitterness and sweetness. When recalling how Chairman Mao and the Communist Party rescued us poor and lower-middle peasants from the sea of fire and led us to a happy life, we both shed tears of excitement. We both vowed in front of Chairman Mao's portrait: forever loyal to Chairman Mao, forever loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, forever loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line! In this way, my feelings with the poor and lower-middle peasants became closer, my heart and the hearts of the poor and lower-middle peasants stuck closer together, my steps became more solid, and my roots were planted deeper.

Through the practice of uniting with the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, I deeply realized: a knowledge youth must consciously listen to Chairman Mao's words, insist on uniting with the workers and peasants, and follow the revolutionary path indicated by Chairman Mao, to continuously achieve ideological revolution, to be loyal to Chairman Mao for life, and to truly become a successor to the proletarian revolutionary cause!

    走毛主席指引的路，和工农群众相结合
    吉林省安图县两江公社东方红大队小学教员、民兵连指导员　孙贵勤
      走和工农相结合的道路，
      自觉地到最艰苦的地方去
    一九六七年八月，我从图们市延边汉语师范学校毕业了。毕业前，姐姐来信要我向组织上讲一下家里的实际情况，争取分配在延吉市工作。姐姐的信正符合我当时的思想。我妈妈五十多岁了，身体又不好，再加上妈妈疼爱我，我也舍不得离开她。可是，要向组织上提出要求吧，又怕同学们说我平时会说一套，到时拉“松套”，怪难看的；不提吧，心里老象有件事。正巧，毕业分配时，把我分配到延吉市工河小学校工作。因为正符合我的心愿，我听说后，就马上表示
  “服从组织分配”。
    我到工河小学上班后，正是无产阶级文化大革命取得决定性胜利，掀起了轰轰烈烈的革命大批判高潮的时候。全校革命师生正在批判中国赫鲁晓夫的“剥削有功”、“公私溶化”等谬论，同志们气愤地说：“中国赫鲁晓夫鼓吹‘剥削有功’和‘公私溶化’论，是叫我们走回头路，吃二遍苦，这万万办不到！毛主席救了我们，我们永远不能忘本！”同志们的话对我的思想触动很大。在回家的路上，我想：人要是忘本，就会变质，就会离开毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。我有没有忘本呢？晚上，我学习了毛主席著作。毛主席说：“不少的人对工作不负责任，拈轻怕重，把重担子推给人家，自己挑轻的。一事当前，先替自己打算，然后再替别人打算。……这种人其实不是共产党员，至少不能算一个纯粹的共产党员。”这几句话正打在我的“私”字上，脸上一阵发烧。我感到在毕业分配问题上我有私心。虽然我没有向组织上提出要到延吉市来，可是，在心里却有让组织上“照顾”的思想活动。我为什么一事当前就先替自己打算呢？这不是资产阶级“私”字作怪吗？有私心能不忘本吗？我抬头看到了毛主席向我们招手的照片，多少往事一古脑地涌上我的心头。在旧社会，我父亲被人贩子骗卖到“木帮”做苦工，在日本鬼子的皮鞭下过着牛马不如的生活。在我刚出生三个月的时候，母亲突然得了重病，是毛主席派来了八路军把她救活了；我没有奶吃，是毛主席派来的八路军一口一口把我喂活的。真是爹亲娘亲不如毛主席亲啊！我是个共产党员，我在工作分配问题上，首先考虑个人，不是首先考虑党和人民的需要，我这不是要忘本吗？！我越想越感到这是中了中国赫鲁晓夫“公私溶化”论的毒。
    回想起一九六六年下半年，伟大的领袖毛主席在北京接见红卫兵的时候，我曾含着幸福的热泪向毛主席宣誓：“我要一辈子不变质！当一辈子毛主席的好战士！”今天，在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的激战中，我怎么能够忘记伟大领袖毛主席的教导呢？毛主席的无产阶级革命路线我认准了，毛主席给我指引的道路，我走定了！一个无限忠于毛主席的革命青年，在艰苦面前，应该走在前头，怎么可以让个人利益缠住自己的身子呢！于是，我对妈妈说：“我要到最艰苦、最偏僻的地方去，我要下农村，不在延吉市了。”开始，她以为我说着玩呢，后来知道是真的，她急忙说：“有些人要求回家、回城市来，你怎么憋起劲来啦！”我觉得，我是在憋劲，是在和“私”字憋劲。我说：“妈，咱可不能和别人比，咱要听毛主席的话，知识青年下农村，这是毛主席的话。”我给妈妈念了一段毛主席语录：“一切可以到农村中去工作的这样的知识分子，应当高兴地到那里去。农村是一个广阔的天地，在那里是可以大有作为的。”接着我又对妈妈说：“我虽然出身于贫苦家庭，生在新社会，长在红旗下，可是，从来没离开过城市，没吃过苦，没受过锻炼，我这样的人，不应该到农村去和工农群众结合，锻炼自己、改造自己吗？毛主席的话咱一定要听啊！”妈妈的心被打动了，我见妈妈不拦我了，便高高兴兴地到州人事部门，要求把我分配到农村去。人事部门的同志很支持我的行动，决定把我调到安图县。
    听说我要到安图县，又有人对我说：“安图水土不好，容易生克山病。”我想，水土不好，可以改变，用毛泽东思想武装起来的人什么也不怕。安图的人民可以在那里为革命种田，我为什么不能到那里为革命工作呢？知识分子到农村去，为广大贫下中农服务，这是毛主席的革命路线。为了捍卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，就是上刀山、下火海，我也要闯。
    到了安图县，县里的同志问我上哪儿去好？我说：“哪里最艰苦，我就到哪里去！”他们给我提了两个学校，叫我选择：一个是小沙河公社的杨木条小学，一个是两江公社的东方红小学。还详细地介绍了这两个学校的情况：杨木条小学，出校门不远就是汽车站，交通方便，那里还有女教员可以做伴；东方红小学，离县城二百多里，每周只通两次汽车，汽车只到公社，离小学校还有二十里，吃粮也要自己到公社去背。我坚决地选择了条件差的东方红小学。县里的同志对我说：“你的身体不太好，那里困难很多，能坚持吗？”我立即回答说：“战胜困难不能光靠身体，要靠战无不胜的毛泽东思想，有了毛泽东思想，什么困难都可以克服；没有毛泽东思想，再小的困难也克服不了！”就这样，我沿着毛主席的革命路线，带着毛主席著作，高高兴兴地来到了长白山下的两江公社东方红小学校。
      彻底改造世界观，把根子
      深深扎在贫下中农之中
    东方红大队位于长白山脚下的一片沼泽地带。三面是山，一面是水，山间小道，前边走人挂起的树枝就抽在后边人的脸上。每到雨季，道路泞滑，很难走。一年四季只有冬天才能行车。因为这个大队位于草甸子中间，所以小咬、蚊子就格外多，夏天不管男女老少，头上都得蒙块白布。广大的贫下中农就在这样的环境里，按照毛主席指引的方向进行着伟大的三大革命运动。
    我刚到这个地方，人生地不熟。因为地方偏僻，生人来的很少，所以，社员们都好奇地看着我。我站也不是，坐也不是。晚上翻来复去睡不着，我心里琢磨，为什么这样不敢接近群众呢？为什么我的思想感情总是和群众有隔阂呢？想到这里，我学习起毛主席著作。毛主席说：“看一个青年是不是革命的，拿什么做标准呢？拿什么去辨别他呢？只有一个标准，这就是看他愿意不愿意、并且实行不实行和广大的工农群众结合在一块。愿意并且实行和工农结合的，是革命的，否则就是不革命的，或者是反革命的。”毛主席的教导，使我认识到，能不能和工农群众相结合，这是革命和反革命的分水岭，是衡量一个青年是不是忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的试金石。一个无限忠于毛主席的革命青年，就要坚决执行毛主席同工农群众相结合的革命路线，只有同工农群众结合在一块，才能进行伟大的革命斗争；只有向工农群众学习，树立全心全意为人民服务的世界观，才能成为无产阶级革命事业可靠的接班人。
    毛主席教导我们：“世界观的转变是一个根本的转变”。要想做到这一点，“就得把自己的思想感情来一个变化，来一番改造。没有这个变化，没有这个改造，什么事情都是做不好的，都是格格不入的。”我深深感到，广大贫下中农和我的父母一样，在旧社会受尽了煎熬，历尽了辛苦，他们无限热爱毛主席，热爱社会主义，热爱新农村，我就要用满腔的热情和贫下中农结合在一起，滚一身泥巴，沾两脚牛屎，甘当贫下中农的小学生，虚心向贫下中农学习，热情为贫下中农服务，把根子深深地扎在贫下中农之中。认识提高了，我就主动接近贫下中农，慢慢地和贫下中农也就熟悉了。
    冬天来了，社员们拉着小爬犁上山了，队里的牛爬犁也一趟趟地把烧柴送到社员家。我便和另一位教员一起也做了两张小爬犁。上山拉柴，这对我来说还是头一回，山高雪厚，山路很陡，困难是很多的。毛主席说：“这个军队具有一往无前的精神，它要压倒一切敌人，而决不被敌人所屈服。”毛主席的教导，给了我无穷的力量。我带上皮帽子，拉上小爬犁，迎着长白山的风雪，一次又一次地上山了。
    几天过后，社员们见我起早上山，就关切地对我说：“孙老师啊，你快歇歇吧！你也烧不了多少柴，队里给你拉点就行了，过去老师都是队里给拉烧柴，男社员这么干也抗不了啊，那有女的这时候还上山？”我听了以后，确实感到自己很累，拉的又少，心想：队里给我拉一爬犁顶我拉六、七趟的。对！等队里给我拉吧！当我回到屋里，看到毛主席微笑着向我招手的照片时，又回忆起去北京串连见到毛主席的幸福情景，向毛主席宣誓的声音又响在我的耳旁，毛主席的谆谆教导又涌现在我的心头：“你要群众了解你，你要和群众打成一片，就得下决心，经过长期的甚至是痛苦的磨练。”白求恩同志毫不利己专门利人，我怎么能为自己着想，叫队里给拉烧柴呢？这怎么能当好群众的小学生呢？我感到，这不是一爬犁两爬犁烧柴的问题，这是在斗私批修的战场上冲上去，还是退下来的问题；在思想革命化的大道上，是紧跟毛主席向前进，还是逃避困难的问题；是让帝国主义、修正主义妄图在中国的第三代或者第四代身上复辟资本主义的阴谋彻底破产，还是甘当资产阶级的接班人的问题。我是毛泽东思想哺育的青年，在斗私批修的战场上一定要猛打猛冲，不能后退。
    为了不影响教学，我还是清早上山，刮大风我上山，下大雪我上山，衣服破了我补上，摔倒了我再爬起来，手脚冻裂了，脸被风雪打得生疼，但是，我的心却炼得更红了。我觉得我不是在打柴，也不是在拉爬犁，我是沿着毛主席的革命路线，在革命化的道路上和“私”字斗，和中国赫鲁晓夫斗。就这样，我不但解决了自己的烧柴问题，同时还帮助生产队给五保户和困难户拉了烧柴。
    毛主席教导我们说：“为了保证我们的党和国家不改变颜色，我们不仅需要正确的路线和政策，而且需要培养和造就千百万无产阶级革命事业的接班人。”“这是关系我们党和国家命运的生死存亡的极其重大的问题。这是无产阶级革命事业的百年大计，千年大计，万年大计。”为了实现思想革命化，真正地滚一身泥巴，踩一脚牛屎，把根子扎在群众中，当好无产阶级革命事业的接班人，我就白天上课，晚上到队里去辅导民兵、社员学习毛主席著作，领着大伙学唱歌颂伟大领袖毛主席的歌曲和毛主席语录歌。我还尽量挤出时间参加生产队的集体生产劳动。啥活累我就干啥活，民兵们放树，我也抡起斧子放树。累，的确是累，但是，社员们比我更累！我的手磨起了泡，社员们手上的老茧不知是磨过多少遍血泡结成的！毛主席教导我们要“经过长期的甚至是痛苦的磨练”，才能真正与工农相结合，才能把自己的思想感情来一个变化。
    毛主席教导我们说：“我们共产党人好比种子，人民好比土地。我们到了一个地方，就要同那里的人民结合起来，在人民中间生根、开花。”我在和贫下中农相结合的过程中，贫下中农都是我的老师，在政治上，他们帮助我提高了阶级斗争觉悟和两条路线斗争觉悟，他们教会了我生产和劳动，帮助我加速了思想革命化；在生活上，他们象父母对待孩子一样关怀我，照顾我，使我和贫下中农的阶级感情越来越深，越连越紧；我也真正把贫下中农当作自己的父母，把他们的需要看作是自己的需要，把他们的疾苦看成是自己的疾苦。五保户李春阳大爷，在旧社会和我父亲一样，吃尽了苦，我就把他当作是自己的父亲，家里没人照顾，我就主动去照顾他。他的衣服脏了我给他洗，头发长了我给他理，队里活忙，没来得及给他拉柴，我就上山给他打烧柴。一有时间，我就请老大爷给我讲家史，讲旧社会的苦难史，忆苦思甜。当讲到毛主席、共产党把我们贫下中农从火海中解放出来，过着幸福生活时，我们一起激动地流下了热泪，我们一同在毛主席他老人家的像前表决心：永远忠于毛主席，永远忠于毛泽东思想，永远忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线！就这样，我和贫下中农的感情越来越接近，我的心和贫下中农的心贴得越来越紧，步子走的越来越扎实，根子越扎越深。
    通过和广大贫下中农相结合的实践，使我深刻地认识到：一个知识青年，必须自觉地听毛主席的话，坚持同工农群众相结合，走毛主席指引的革命道路，才能不断实现思想革命化，才能一辈子忠于毛主席，真正成为无产阶级革命事业的接班人！
