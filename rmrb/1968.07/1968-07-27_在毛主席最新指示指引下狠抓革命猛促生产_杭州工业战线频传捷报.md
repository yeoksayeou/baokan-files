Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, the workers of Hangzhou are vigorously pursuing revolution and vigorously promoting production. The industrial front in Hangzhou frequently reports victories.

Since the beginning of this year, the total industrial output value has been continuously rising, with each month surpassing the previous one and each quarter exceeding the last. Technological innovations and technological revolutions have continuously achieved new successes, with over a hundred new products successfully developed.

Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, July 25th - Under the guidance of the great leader Chairman Mao's latest instructions, the proletarian revolutionary masses of Hangzhou City are vigorously pursuing class struggle, conducting a thorough and in-depth revolutionary criticism, and launching a fierce offensive against class enemies. They are vigorously pursuing revolution and vigorously promoting production, making the revolutionary and production situation on the industrial front unprecedentedly good.

Since the beginning of this year, the total industrial output value of Hangzhou City has been rising steadily, with each month surpassing the previous one and each quarter exceeding the last. The inspiring news of victories has been frequently reported. Based on the dual victories of revolution and production achieved in the first two months of this year, the total industrial output value in March increased by 44% compared to February. The output values in April and May also saw significant increases. The total industrial output value in June increased by 7.4% compared to May. The production of electricity, as well as steel, chemical fertilizers, pesticide machinery, tea processing machinery, soda ash, electronic tubes, burlap, cotton cloth, silk, machine-made paper, soap, and rubber shoes—all essential products for national construction and people's livelihood—has been increasing month by month.

In the battle to promote revolution and production, the proletarian revolutionary masses and revolutionary workers of Hangzhou's industrial front have always remembered Chairman Mao's teaching, "Never forget class struggle." Using the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as their weapon, they have timely studied and grasped the new trends and characteristics of class struggle, launching a fierce offensive against a handful of stubborn class enemies, traitors, spies, and other counter-revolutionaries. They have smashed the various plots and tricks of the class enemies who attempted to sabotage the revolution and production. From workshops and teams to workers' dormitories, revolutionary criticism battles have been set up everywhere. Revolutionary workers, in conjunction with the cleanup of class ranks and the struggle, criticism, and transformation within their units, have continuously deepened the revolutionary criticism.

During the revolutionary criticism, various factories have severely criticized the revisionist goods such as the "material incentives," "expert path," and "crawling philosophy" promoted by China's Khrushchev and a handful of capitalist roaders within the party on the industrial front. They have broken the unreasonable old rules and regulations that shackle the initiative of the workers. The revolutionary enthusiasm of the broad revolutionary workers has soared to unprecedented heights, continuously achieving new successes in technological innovation and technological revolution. Since the beginning of this year, the industrial front of the city has successfully developed over a hundred new products, including a new type of precision surface grinder with international advanced level, hand-held tractors, fiberglass oxygen cylinders, and split-type hydraulic jacks. The revolutionary workers of Hangzhou Machine Tool Factory, carrying forward the spirit of daring to think and dare to do, successfully developed another type of precision grinder with world-advanced level after successfully developing a new type of precision surface grinder with world-advanced level, raising industrial production to a new level. The revolutionary workers of Hangzhou Zhakou Power Plant have renovated outdated equipment, not only ensuring safe operation but also increasing power generation and significantly reducing coal consumption, providing strong support for industrial and agricultural production.

The broad revolutionary workers on Hangzhou's industrial front, with deep proletarian feelings for the great leader Chairman Mao, have extensively and deeply carried out the "three loyalties" activity of being loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. They have eagerly studied Chairman Mao's works and resolutely implemented Chairman Mao's latest instructions. Various factories, workshops, teams, and workers' dormitories have set up various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, making Mao Zedong Thought universally popular. Through the establishment of study classes, the class struggle and two-line struggle consciousness of the workers have greatly improved. They regard the resolute implementation of the great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production" advocated by the great leader Chairman Mao as a practical action of loyalty to Chairman Mao, loyalty to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyalty to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

In the battle to grasp revolution and promote production, the leadership members of many factories' revolutionary committees in Hangzhou City have followed Chairman Mao's teaching of "organizing a revolutionary and people-oriented leadership team," breaking old frameworks, taking the path of "streamlining administration," going deep into the front lines of class struggle and production struggle, actively accepting criticism and supervision from the masses, further strengthening their ties with the masses, consolidating the newly established revolutionary committees, making the revolution roar and the production boil.
