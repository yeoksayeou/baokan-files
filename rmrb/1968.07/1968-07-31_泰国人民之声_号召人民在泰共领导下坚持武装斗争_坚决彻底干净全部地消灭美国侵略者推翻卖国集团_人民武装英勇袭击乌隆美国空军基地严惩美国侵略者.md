"The Voice of the Thai People" radio station broadcasted an article on the 29th, firmly declaring that the Thai people are determined to, under the leadership of the Thai Communist Party, decisively, thoroughly, cleanly, and completely eliminate the American aggressors and overthrow the Thanom-Praphat traitorous clique, until achieving complete national liberation.

The article states that due to the betrayal by the Thanom-Praphat clique, Thailand has become a colony and military invasion base of American imperialism. American imperialism has dispatched nearly 100,000 invading troops to Thailand, extensively building military bases, strategic roads, and various military facilities. In the northeast, there are military air bases in Korat, Udon Thani, Ubon Ratchathani, and Nakhon Phanom. In the central region, there are air bases in Lop Buri, U-Tapao, and Takli, and a naval base in Sattahip. In Khon Kaen and Phatthalung, air bases are being rapidly constructed. In Korat, Ubon Ratchathani, Nakhon Sawan, and Nan, there are secret missile launch sites. Currently, there are over 60 American military bases, military airports, military ports, ammunition depots, radar networks, and various military facilities in Thailand.

The article reveals that the American military bases and various military facilities in Thailand are used to invade Laos, Vietnam, and to prepare for an attack on China. For this reason, American imperialism is currently rapidly expanding its military facilities in Thailand, constructing strategic roads, and actively expanding its military invasion actions.

The article reveals that the U.S. Army's 9th Logistics Command stationed in Korat has stockpiled 41,000 tons of military supplies, enough to arm one division of the invading American army. This logistics command can also provide military equipment for 135,000 to 160,000 invading American troops.

The article points out that the nearly 100,000 American invading troops in Thailand are rampant, bringing endless disasters to the Thai people. These American soldiers also openly participate in the criminal activities of suppressing the Thai people. The heinous crimes committed by the American bandits against the Thai people must be thoroughly settled, and blood debts must be repaid.

The article states that under the correct leadership of the Thai Communist Party, the Thai people's patriotic struggle against American aggression is developing daily. Anti-American leaflets are continuously appearing in urban and rural areas, and the flames of revolutionary armed struggle are burning more fiercely, heavily striking American imperialism.

The article expresses that the Thai people have made up their minds to decisively drive out the American invading aggressors through armed struggle and overthrow the Thanom-Praphat traitorous clique. The article firmly believes that under the correct leadership of the Thai Communist Party, the Thai people will definitely defeat American imperialism and its puppet Thanom-Praphat traitorous clique.

According to a broadcast by "The Voice of the Thai People" radio station on the 30th, the people's armed forces in Udon Thani, northeastern Thailand, bravely attacked the Udon Thani U.S. Air Force base on the night of the 26th, severely punishing the American aggressors.

The radio station said that the people and armed forces of Udon Thani have recently frequently taken the initiative to attack American aggressors and the Thanom-Praphat traitorous clique, continuously achieving new victories. On the night of the 26th, this armed force, which is united with the people and receives strong support from the masses, bravely attacked the Udon Thani U.S. Air Force base. According to the admission of the U.S.-Thanom clique, the brave armed forces soldiers broke through the "guards'" heavy defenses, entered the airport, and blew up and damaged multiple American planes, killing and injuring many American invaders and puppet soldiers of the Thanom clique.

The radio station said that during the people's armed forces' attack on the Udon Thani U.S. Air Force base, the enemy was in a state of panic and chaos. The people of Udon Thani are jubilant about the victory of attacking the U.S. Air Force base.

The radio station said that the people and armed forces of Udon Thani are rapidly developing and growing stronger in the struggle. Currently, in the eight counties and two sub-counties of Udon Thani, seven counties and one sub-county have launched people's armed struggles. The radio station pointed out that this time, the people's armed forces in Udon Thani bravely attacked the U.S. Air Force base, clearly showing that for the U.S.-Thanom clique, there is no safe place. They have fallen into a situation where they are being attacked everywhere.

    文章指出，在泰国的近十万名美国侵略军横行霸道，给泰国人民带来无穷灾难。这些美国兽兵还公然参加镇压泰国人民的罪恶活动。美国强盗对泰国人民所犯下的滔天罪行，泰国人民一定要同它彻底清算，讨还血债。
    文章说，在泰国共产党的正确领导下，泰国人民反对美帝侵略的爱国斗争，正在日益发展，反美传单在城乡各地不断出现，革命武装斗争烈火越烧越旺，沉重地打击了美帝国主义。
    文章表示，泰国人民已经下定决心，坚决以武装斗争把美国侵略强盗赶出去，推翻他侬—巴博卖国集团。文章坚信，在泰国共产党的正确领导下，泰国人民必定战胜美帝国主义及其走狗他侬—巴博卖国集团。
