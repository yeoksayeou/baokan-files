The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "The people, and the people alone, are the motive force in the creation of world history." What a profound truth this is!

One day in March, at noon, the bell signaling the end of the workday rang. I walked out of the office and looked outside. Oh, the snow was melting! The melting of the winter snow reminded me that the grain in the granary needed to be dried immediately. I hurriedly found the relevant comrades to ask about the preparations for drying the grain. They said: This year, the amount of grain to be dried is 50% more than last year, and there are many difficulties with the drying sites and materials. At the time, I heard these words and felt a great deal of pressure, thinking: The revolutionary people of the entire county, under the brilliant guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, have achieved an unprecedented agricultural bumper harvest last year. How can we let these fruits be damaged? Losing grain is a crime.

No matter what, we cannot let a single grain of grain go moldy. But how to do it? While I was racking my brains, Chairman Mao's teaching, "The masses are the true heroes," came to my mind. Chairman Mao's warm instructions gave me great strength. I then discussed with the members of the Revolutionary Committee and decided to immediately convene a symposium with relevant units to study the grain drying problem. The next day, comrades from the relevant units all came. We introduced the grain drying tasks and the current preparation situation for the entire county, and everyone began to discuss. This one suggested an idea, that one proposed a method, this unit provided materials, that unit cleared a drying site. The meeting lasted less than two hours, and all the materials and sites needed for drying were secured. After the meeting, I went down to check, and the drying materials were all well-prepared, and the drying sites were also quite ideal.

Just as the drying work began, new problems arose: there was a shortage of manpower for drying. I went to the masses again and had discussions with comrades from various departments and schools. They said: The grain drying work should also fully rely on and mobilize the masses, and cannot rely solely on fixed workers. It should, without affecting normal work, draw appropriate personnel from various units to take turns participating in the drying work. This way, the solution came out. Because the work of mobilizing the masses was done quite thoroughly, one day, more than three thousand people were mobilized at once. In just three and a half hours, the grain concentrated in the county granary was spread out to the drying fields several miles away from the granary.

In this way, following Chairman Mao's teaching of "believing in and relying on the masses," we completed the grain drying task for the entire county one month ahead of schedule, and not a single grain of grain went moldy. This incident made me deeply realize: A leading cadre must never be separated from the masses. A leading cadre is like a "zero." "Zero" can only function when connected with nine other numbers. Separated from the nine numbers, it loses its meaning. I will always regard myself as a "zero," always believe in the masses, rely on the masses, and place myself among the masses to play my due role.

### 群众是真正的英雄

    群众是真正的英雄
    黑龙江省明水县革命委员会常委  张元甫
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“人民，只有人民，才是创造世界历史的动力。”这是多么深刻的真理啊！
    三月份的一天中午，下班的铃声响了。我走出办公室到外边一看，嗬，化雪啦！冬雪的融化，提醒我粮库的粮食需要马上晾晒。我急忙找有关同志打听晾晒粮的准备工作做得怎么样了。他们说：今年粮食晾晒量比去年增加百分之五十，晾晒场地和物资都有很大困难。当时，我听到这番话，感到压力很大，心想：全县革命人民在战无不胜的毛泽东思想光辉照耀下，去年夺得历史上少有的农业大丰收，怎能让这些果实受到损失呢？损失了粮食就是犯罪。
    无论如何不能霉烂一粒粮。可是怎么办呢？在我一个劲地转磨磨的时候，毛主席“群众是真正的英雄”的教导，出现在我的脑海里。毛主席的亲切教导，给了我巨大的力量。我便找革委会委员们商量，决定立即召集有关单位开座谈会，研究粮食晾晒问题。第二天，有关单位的同志都来了，我们把全县粮食晾晒任务和当前准备的情况一介绍，大家就你一言我一语地讨论开了。这个出一个主意，那个提一个办法，这家出一项物资，那家腾一处晾晒场地。会议不到两个小时，就把晾晒需要的物资和场地落实下来了。会后，我下去一检查，晾晒物资准备得都很齐整，晾晒场地也比较理想。
    晾晒工作刚一开始，新的问题又出现了：晾晒人力不足。我又到群众中去，和各机关、学校等单位的同志座谈。他们说：晒粮工作也要充分依靠和发动群众，不能单靠固定工人，应该在不影响正常工作的情况下，从各单位抽调适当的人员轮换参加晾晒工作。这样，办法就出来了。由于发动群众工作做得比较充分，有一天一下子就出动了三千多人。仅三个半小时，就把集中在县粮库的粮食铺散到距粮库几里以外的晒粮场地。
    就这样，按照毛主席“相信和依靠群众”的教导，提前一个月圆满地完成了全县粮食晾晒任务，粮食都没有霉烂。这件事，使我深深体会到：一个领导干部一刻也不能脱离群众。领导干部好比一个“零”，“零”只有和九个数字连在一起，才能起到作用，脱离了九个数字，它就失去了意义。我要永远把自己当作“零”，永远相信群众，依靠群众，置身于群众之中，去发挥自己应有的作用。
