	Australian Students Protest Against U.S. Aggression in Vietnam

	BEIJING, July 20 (Xinhua) -- MELBOURNE -- Students at the University of Queensland in Brisbane, Australia, held a demonstration on July 19 to protest against a representative of a puppet regime in South Vietnam who was visiting the school to advocate for U.S. aggression in Vietnam.

	When the representative of the South Vietnamese puppet regime attempted to justify the U.S. war in Vietnam, students hung a noose above his head in protest. They also wrote slogans on the blackboard denouncing the South Vietnamese puppet regime as "a puppet of the United States."

	On that day, students wore badges featuring the flag of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam and hung the flag of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam to show their support for the Vietnamese people's just struggle.
