Chairman Mao teaches us: "We must make the broad masses understand that we represent their interests and that we breathe with them." The newly established revolutionary committees are indeed breathing with and closely connected to the broad revolutionary masses. Therefore, hundreds of millions of people cherish, support, and help the newly established revolutionary organs—the revolutionary committees—as if they were their own eyes. Three small stories from the Liaoyang Machine Repair Factory vividly reflect how the great leader Mao Zedong, who personally nurtured the revolutionary committees, has such a powerful and solid mass foundation! The broad revolutionary masses genuinely support the revolutionary committees, which is a powerful driving force for the consolidation and development of the newly established revolutionary committees and an iron wall against the schemes of class enemies to split and overthrow the revolutionary committees.—Editor

Since the establishment of the factory revolutionary committee, workers at the Liaoyang Machine Repair Factory in Liaoning Province affectionately refer to the veteran worker Zhang Rishun from the lathe group as the "extraordinary director" of the revolutionary committee. Why do the workers call him that?

Originally, Zhang, a worker from a poor peasant family, suffered greatly in the old society. After liberation, especially during the past two years of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, he deeply felt the importance of holding the helm of the proletariat. Therefore, after the establishment of the factory revolutionary committee, Zhang genuinely cared for and cherished the new revolutionary power. For anything beneficial to the consolidation and development of the revolutionary committee, he always worked with great enthusiasm. For every decision and plan of the revolutionary committee, he actively promoted and diligently executed them. What is even more valuable is that he not only cared for the consolidation and development of the revolutionary committee himself but also helped and educated everyone to care for their own revolutionary power.

Once, Zhang heard that apprentice Xiaoli was either playing basketball during work hours or chatting idly in the dormitory, and sometimes even went to the Taizi River to learn swimming. This greatly shocked him. He thought: Xiaoli used to be good at grasping the revolution and promoting production. Why did he suddenly start acting anarchistically after the establishment of the revolutionary committee? Zhang carefully investigated and found that Xiaoli's change was instigated by a few class enemies. Moreover, it was not just Xiaoli who was influenced. These young people's anarchism was not the class enemies exploiting the bourgeois "self" in their minds to attack our revolutionary power? Chairman Mao teaches us: "Class enemies will definitely look for opportunities to show themselves. They are not willing to accept defeat and communism." We must not be complacent! Therefore, Zhang Rishun often talked to these young people, studied Chairman Mao's teachings on the fundamental issue of the revolution being the issue of power with them, recalled the bitterness of the old society when the laboring people had no rights, talked about the sweetness of having rights now, and discussed the sharp and complex class struggles in the factory after the establishment of the revolutionary committee.

Because Zhang did painstaking and meticulous ideological and political work, these young people finally realized their mistakes and decided to draw a clear line with the class enemies. Xiaoli even exposed and criticized in a factory meeting the bad element who had incited him to act anarchistically, disrupted the revolution and production, and attempted to overthrow the revolutionary committee. Since then, Xiaoli has been coming to work early and leaving late, consciously regarding the revolution and production as actual actions to support the new revolutionary power and defend the revolutionary line of Chairman Mao. He has been completing his production tasks ahead of schedule every shift, earning praise from everyone.

Zhang saw that Xiaoli had overcome anarchism and become a small warrior attacking the class enemies, and he was genuinely happy. However, he did not feel satisfied with this. He still often studied Chairman Mao's works with these young people, helping them continuously improve their awareness of the two-line struggle, care for the construction of the new revolutionary power of the revolutionary committee, and forever advance along the revolutionary line of Chairman Mao. Everyone said: Zhang not only cares for and supports the revolutionary committee himself but also, with the attitude of a master, helps comrades care for the revolutionary committee. He truly is like an "extraordinary director" of the revolutionary committee.

    革委会的“编外主任”
    毛主席教导我们：“要使广大群众认识我们是代表他们的利益的，是和他们呼吸相通的。”新生的革命委员会，正是和广大革命人民群众呼吸相通、血肉相连的。因此，亿万人民群众，象爱护自己的眼珠一样，爱护、支持、帮助新生的革命政权——革命委员会。辽阳市机床修理厂的三个小故事，就生动地反映了我们伟大领袖毛主席所亲手抚育成长的革命委员会，有着多么强大、多么雄厚的群众基础！广大革命人民群众真心实意地拥护革命委员会，是新生的革委会巩固和发展的强大动力，是战胜一切阶级敌人分裂、颠覆革委会的阴谋的铜墙铁壁。——编者
    辽宁省辽阳市机床修理厂自从成立厂革委会以后，工人们都亲切地称呼车工组老工人张日春为革委会的“编外主任”。工人们为啥这样称呼他呢？
    原来，贫农出身的张师傅在旧社会受尽了苦难，解放后，特别是两年来的无产阶级文化大革命，使他深切地体会到掌好无产阶级印把子的重要性。所以，厂革委会成立后，张师傅打心眼里关心爱护新生的革命政权，凡是对巩固和发展革委会有利的事，他总是大干特干，对革委会每一项决定和计划，他总是积极宣传，认真执行。更可贵的是，他不但自己关心革委会的巩固和发展，而且帮助和教育大家都关心自己的革命政权。
    一次，张师傅听说徒工小李在上班时间里不是打篮球，就是跑到宿舍里闲扯皮，甚至有时还跑到太子河里学游泳，这使他受到很大震动。他心里想：小李过去抓革命促生产一直很好，为什么偏巧在革委会成立以后，突然闹起无政府主义来了呢？张师傅仔细调查了一番，发现小李的变化，是极少数阶级敌人在背后挑动引起的。而且被挑动的不只是小李一个人。这些青年人所以闹无政府主义，不正是阶级敌人利用他们头脑里的资产阶级“私”字，向我们革命政权进攻吗？毛主席教导我们：“阶级敌人是一定要寻找机会表现他们自己的。他们对于亡国、共产是不甘心的。”我们可千万不能麻痹大意呀！于是，张日春就多次找这些小青年谈心，和他们一起学习毛主席关于革命的根本问题是政权问题的教导，忆旧社会劳动人民无权的苦，谈现在有权的甜，摆革委会成立后厂里存在的尖锐复杂的阶级斗争。
    由于张师傅耐心、细致地做了思想政治工作，终于使这几个小青年认识到自己的错误，决心和阶级敌人划清界限。小李还在车间大会上狠揭狠批了那个拉拢自己闹无政府主义、破坏抓革命促生产、妄图颠覆革委会的坏家伙。从那以后，小李每天早上班，晚下班，自觉地把抓革命促生产当作支持新生的革命政权、捍卫毛主席革命路线的实际行动，班班超额完成生产任务，得到大家的好评。
    张师傅看到小李克服了无政府主义，成了向阶级敌人进攻的小闯将，真是打心眼里往外高兴。但是，他并没有因此而满足，他还是经常和这些小青年一块学习毛主席著作，帮助他们不断提高两条路线斗争觉悟，关心革委会这个新生革命政权的建设，使他们永远沿着毛主席革命路线前进。大家都说：张师傅不但自己关心和支持革委会，而且还以主人翁的态度，帮助同志们关心革委会，可真象个革委会的“编外主任”了。
