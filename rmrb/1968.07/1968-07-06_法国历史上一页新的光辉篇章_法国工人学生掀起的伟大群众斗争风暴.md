Since May, the great revolutionary struggle of French workers and students has swept across the entire country with the force of a mighty storm and the power of thunder. It has struck a powerful blow against the reactionary rule of the French monopolistic bourgeoisie and shaken the decaying capitalist system of the world. The outstanding sons and daughters of the French people, inheriting the glorious revolutionary tradition of the Paris Commune, have written a new and brilliant chapter in the history of France.

An Unprecedented Violent Storm

In early May, students in Paris first ignited the flames of this great mass revolutionary struggle. They marched out of their schools to bravely challenge the rotten capitalist education system and social system. Over sixty million university students and millions of high school students across the country responded to the call. Driven and inspired by the unprecedented surge of the student movement, more than ten million French workers rose up to launch economic and political general strikes, occupying half of the factories and enterprises nationwide. In a short period, from the mining areas of northern France to the Mediterranean coast in the south, from the port of Bordeaux on the Atlantic coast in the west to Strasbourg on the French-German border in the east, revolutionary red flags flew over the skies of factories and enterprises. In more than ninety provinces of France, the flames of mass struggle burned everywhere.

The Struggle Targets the Rotten Old System

One important feature of this great revolutionary storm is that the struggle clearly targets the evil rule of the French monopolistic bourgeoisie and the decaying capitalist system. This shows that the awareness and level of struggle of the French people have reached a new height.

Thousands upon thousands of students and workers took to the streets, shouting, "Revolution! Revolution!" "Down with the police state!" "Down with the anti-people government that causes unemployment and poverty!" "Power to the workers!" They attacked the French Senate, besieged many provincial governments, burned the "temple of capitalism" – the Paris Stock Exchange, and bravely challenged the police, gendarmes, and courts, these reactionary state machines. Progressive students in Paris publicly declared that their struggle would be conducted within the scope of "negating and opposing the capitalist system" and would be linked to the struggle of "laborers to overthrow the old production relations and transform the economic structure."

"Workers and Students Unite!"

Another striking feature of this revolutionary storm is that the student movement and the workers' movement support and inspire each other, driving the struggle to intensify.

As early as May, when Paris students first took to the streets, Paris workers joined the student demonstrations. "Workers and students unite!" became the loudest slogan in this revolutionary storm. When students were brutally suppressed in May, French workers launched a general strike to support the students' struggle. In early June, when workers at the Renault car factory in Flins were savagely attacked by the police, thousands of Paris students broke through the police blockade overnight and rushed to support them. Over two months, French students and workers forged a deep revolutionary friendship in the struggle.

Revolutionary Violence Against Counter-Revolutionary Violence

Another striking feature of this storm is that French students and workers fear no violence, despise the bourgeoisie's "laws" and "order," do not listen to the instructions and commands of the revisionists and yellow unions, and bravely challenge the capitalist system. They organized occupation committees and patrols, occupied schools, and seized factories, locking up the bosses and capitalists who had always oppressed and exploited the workers inside the factories and mines.

When the French government deployed heavily armed police, gendarmes, and security forces to carry out brutal suppression, French students and workers declared:

"We will counter bourgeois violence with revolutionary violence." They built barricades and fought all night against the reactionary police and military. They seized the police's water cannons, picked up un-exploded tear gas and stun grenades, added stones and homemade Molotov cocktails, and drove the reactionary police and military into a chaotic retreat. They burned police cars, besieged and set fire to police stations, turning many cities that the ruling class had always seen as havens into battlefields filled with thick smoke and rubble.

The Ruling Class in Panic, Playing Dirty Tricks

Over two months, the French ruling class and its various accomplices and lackeys, burned by the flames of the people's struggle, desperately suppressed and opposed the people, fully exposing their ugly and ferocious faces. They acted as negative teachers, giving the French people a profound negative education.

To maintain their shaky reactionary rule, the French monopolistic bourgeoisie spared no effort, using both political deception and violent suppression. On the one hand, they staged the farce of "elections," verbally agreeing to "reforms," and making minor concessions on wages and benefits to deceive the people. On the other hand, they brazenly deployed the country's police, secret agents, gendarmes, and security forces to carry out bloody suppression against students and workers. Over two months, the French reactionaries publicly killed two young workers and a student, and injured and arrested thousands. The French ruling class owes the French people a huge blood debt.

The Traitorous Face of the French Revisionists Exposed

At the moment when the French ruling class was in serious crisis, the French Communist Party revisionist leadership and the heads of the French General Confederation of Labor, controlled by the revisionists, openly came out to maintain the bourgeoisie's "laws" and "order," sparing no effort to attack and sabotage the just struggle of students and workers, nakedly exposing their traitorous and scab faces, acting as the watchdogs of the imperialist and capitalist exploitation system.

The revisionist leaders hated and feared the French students who first rose up to struggle. They acted as defenders of the reactionary authorities, repeatedly attacking and slandering the students' just struggle as "provocateurs" creating "riots." When the vast majority of French workers broke through the numerous obstacles they set up and launched a nationwide wave of factory occupations and strikes, strongly shaking the rule of the monopolistic bourgeoisie, the revisionist leaders could not wait to reach an agreement with the government and capitalists to return to work, selling out the fundamental interests of the workers. They closely collaborated, playing various tricks and schemes, using all means of coercion, bribery, and sowing discord to help the French ruling class sabotage the magnificent mass struggle. It is no wonder that Western European bourgeois newspapers openly praised the revisionist leaders as the "natural allies of the French government" in suppressing the workers' revolutionary movement.

In actual struggles, more and more progressive French workers and students have come to recognize that the revisionists are the vicious enemies within the workers' movement, and that without overthrowing revisionism, it is impossible to overthrow capitalism.

The French People Will Surely Achieve Victory

With the help of the revisionists, the French ruling class has temporarily suppressed the magnificent revolutionary mass movement. Currently, it is intensifying repression measures against the revolutionary people. On the one hand, it brazenly dissolves large numbers of workers' and students' organizations, arresting and persecuting progressive workers and students. On the other hand, it is further cutting into the economic interests of the laboring people. However, the greater the oppression, the stronger the resistance. The reactionary measures of the French reactionaries will further intensify the sharp class contradictions within France, prompting the French people to fight more resolutely.

The revolutionary Marxist-Leninists of France, with their glorious revolutionary traditions, will surely accumulate rich experience from this revolutionary storm and become stronger. No matter how desperately the French monopolistic bourgeoisie and the revisionist clique struggle, no matter how many difficulties the French people will face in their future struggles, victory will surely belong to the French people. As our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out: "The socialist system will inevitably replace the capitalist system. This is an objective law that does not change with people's will. No matter how the reactionaries try to stop the forward march of the wheel of history, revolution will occur sooner or later and will inevitably achieve victory."

### 法国历史上一页新的光辉篇章——法国工人学生掀起的伟大群众斗争风暴

    法国历史上一页新的光辉篇章
    ——法国工人学生掀起的伟大群众斗争风暴
    五月以来，法国工人、学生革命斗争的伟大风暴，以排山倒海之势、雷霆万钧之力，席卷整个法国。它猛烈地冲击着法国垄断资产阶级的反动统治，震动了腐朽没落的世界资本主义制度。法国人民的优秀儿女，继承巴黎公社的光荣革命传统，在法国历史上又写下了新的光辉灿烂的一页。
            空前猛烈的革命风暴
    五月初，巴黎学生首先点燃了这场伟大的群众革命斗争的怒火，他们走出校门，勇敢地向腐朽的资产阶级的教育制度和社会制度挑战。全国六十多万大学生和以百万计的中学生纷纷起来响应。在空前高涨的学生运动的推动和激发下，一千多万法国工人奋起举行经济和政治总罢工，并且占领了全国一半的工厂和企业。在很短的时间里，从法国北部的矿区到南部的地中海滨，从西部大西洋岸的港口波尔多到东部法国西德边境的斯特拉斯堡，厂矿企业的上空处处飘扬起革命的红旗，法国的九十多个省份，到处燃起了群众斗争的烈火。
      斗争矛头直指腐朽的旧制度
    这场伟大的革命风暴的一个重要的特点是，斗争的矛头明确地指向法国垄断资产阶级的罪恶统治，指向腐朽的资本主义制度。这表明，法国人民群众的觉悟程度和斗争的水平，已发展到一个新的高度。
    成千成万的学生工人走上街头，高呼：“革命！革命！”“打倒警察国家！”“打倒造成失业贫困的反人民政权！”“权力归于工人！”他们袭击了法国参议院，围攻许多省政府，火烧“资本主义的神殿”——巴黎股票交易所，勇敢地向警察、宪兵、法庭这些反动的国家机器挑战。巴黎进步学生公开声明，他们的斗争要在“否定和反对资本主义制度的斗争范围内进行”，要同“劳动者推翻（旧的）生产关系和改造经济结构”的斗争联系起来。
        “工人和学生团结起来！”
    这场革命风暴的另一个鲜明的特点是，学生运动和工人运动互相支持，互相鼓舞，推动斗争猛烈发展。
    早在五月初，巴黎学生开始走上街头，巴黎工人就参加了学生示威的行列。“工人和学生团结起来”，成了这场革命风暴中最响亮的口号。当五月中学生遭到残暴镇压时，法国工人举行了总罢工声援学生的斗争。六月上旬，在弗兰的雷诺汽车工厂的工人遭到警察野蛮的袭击时，大批巴黎学生连夜冲破警察重重封锁，从巴黎赶去支援。两个月来，法国学生和工人在战斗中结下了深厚的革命友谊。
      以革命暴力对付反革命暴力
    这场风暴的再一个鲜明的特点是，法国学生、工人不畏强暴，藐视资产阶级的“法律”和“秩序”，不听法修和黄色工会的“指示”和号令，向资本主义制度勇敢挑战。他们组织起占领委员会和纠察队，占领学校，占据工厂，把一贯欺压剥削工人的老板、资本家关在厂矿里面不准离开。
    当法国政府出动大批全副武装的警察、宪兵、保安队进行残暴镇压时，法国的学生和工人毅然声明：
  “我们要以革命的暴力对付资产阶级的暴力。”他们筑起街垒，同反动军警通宵搏斗。他们抢过警察手中的高压水龙，捡起尚未爆炸的催泪弹和震荡手榴弹，加上石块和自制燃烧瓶，把反动军警打得抱头鼠窜。他们焚毁警车，围攻并火烧警察局，把统治集团一直视作安乐窝的许多大城市，变成了浓烟滚滚，瓦砾遍地的战场。
      统治集团焦头烂额大耍阴谋
    两个月来，被法国人民斗争的烈火烧得焦头烂额的法国统治集团及其形形色色的帮凶和走狗，拚命地镇压和反对人民，充分暴露了他们的狰狞丑恶的面目。他们充当了反面教员，给了法国人民以深刻的反面教育。
    为了维持摇摇欲坠的反动统治，法国垄断资产阶级竭尽全力，使用了政治欺骗和暴力镇压的反革命两手。它一方面玩弄“选举”丑剧，口头上答应进行
  “改革”，并在工资福利问题上作微小的让步，借以欺骗人民；另一方面，它悍然出动全国的警察、特务、宪兵和保安队，对学生和工人进行血腥镇压。两个月来，法国反动派公开杀害了两个青年工人和一个学生，先后打伤和逮捕了几千人。法国统治集团欠下法国人民一笔巨大的血债。
        法修集团的叛徒面目毕露
    法共修正主义领导集团以及法修控制的法国总工会的头目，在法国统治集团陷入严重危机的时刻，公开跳出来维护资产阶级的“法律”和“秩序”，不遗余力地攻击和破坏学生和工人的正义斗争，赤裸裸地暴露了它们叛徒和工贼的丑恶嘴脸，起了帝国主义、资本主义剥削制度看家狗的作用。
    法修头目对于首先起来斗争的法国学生恨得要死，怕得要命。他们充当反动当局的辩护士，一再攻击、诬蔑学生的正义斗争是“挑衅分子”，在制造“暴乱”。当法国广大的工人群众冲破他们设置的重重障碍，在全国范围掀起占厂、罢工的怒潮，强烈地震撼了垄断资产阶级的统治的时候，法修头目迫不及待地同政府和资本家达成复工“协议”，出卖工人的根本利益。他们密切地配合，玩弄了各种阴谋诡计，竭尽了威逼利诱、挑拨离间的能事，帮助法国统治集团，破坏轰轰烈烈的群众斗争。这就无怪乎西欧的资产阶级报刊公开夸奖法修头目在压制工人的革命运动方面是“法国政府的天生盟友”。
    在实际斗争中，越来越多的进步的法国工人和学生，认识到法修是工人运动里的凶恶的敌人，不打倒修正主义，就无法推翻资本主义。
          法国人民必将取得胜利
    法国统治集团在法修的帮助下，把轰轰烈烈的革命群众运动暂时压了下去，目前，它正在加紧向革命人民实行镇压措施。它一方面悍然解散大批工人和学生的组织，逮捕和迫害进步的工人和学生；另一方面还在经济方面进一步向劳动人民开刀。但是，压迫越大，反抗越强。法国反动派的这些倒行逆施，必将进一步加剧法国国内尖锐的阶级矛盾，促使法国人民更坚决地起来斗争。
    法国革命的马克思列宁主义者，具有光荣革命传统的法国人民，经过这场革命大风暴的锻炼，一定会积累丰富的斗争经验，变得更坚强。不管法国垄断资产阶级和修正主义集团如何垂死挣扎，不管法国人民在今后的斗争中还会遇到多大的困难，胜利一定属于法国人民。正如我们伟大领袖毛主席所指出的：“社会主义制度终究要代替资本主义制度，这是一个不以人们自己的意志为转移的客观规律。不管反动派怎样企图阻止历史车轮的前进，革命或迟或早总会发生，并且将必然取得胜利。”
