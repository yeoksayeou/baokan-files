Recently, the storm of student struggles in Thailand has been rising. On June 21, students in Bangkok held a massive anti-American demonstration. Starting from July 11, thousands of students at Thammasat University launched a new struggle. The eruption of a large-scale student movement in the reactionary stronghold of the United States and Thailand is a new development in the patriotic democratic struggle of the Thai people, and it is also a new sign of the increasing instability of the reactionary rule of the Thanon-Praphat traitorous clique.

The Glorious Victories of Armed Struggle Promote the Development of the Revolution

The armed struggle of the Thai people under the leadership of the Communist Party of Thailand has developed victorious, pointing out the correct path for the Thai people to struggle for liberation. The revolution in Thailand is facing a very good situation.

Since 1965, when the Thai people fired the first shot of armed struggle in Nakphanon District, the flames of the Thai people's armed revolutionary struggle have been burning more and more fiercely on the land of Thailand. In the past two years, the Thanon traitorous clique, with the support of American imperialism, has sent large numbers of reactionary troops and used various modern weapons to carry out frenzied suppression of the people's armed forces. However, the Thai people's armed forces, mobilizing the masses and relying on the masses, have used the strategies and tactics of people's war to repeatedly smash the counter-revolutionary "encirclement and suppression" of the American-Thai reactionaries, achieving glorious victories time and time again. In the past two years, the Thai people's armed forces have fought nearly 800 battles with the enemy, annihilating more than 2,000 enemy troops and seizing a large number of weapons and ammunition from the enemy. Currently, the armed struggle of the Thai people has spread to 30 out of 71 provinces and is continuing to expand.

The armed struggle of the Thai people has dealt a heavy blow to the reactionary rule of the American aggressors and the Thanon traitorous clique in Thailand, greatly boosting the fighting will of the Thai patriotic people to struggle for national liberation. It is under such circumstances that the mass struggle of the Thai people has surged to new heights.

The Rise of the Student Movement: The Beginning of a Second Front

The recent demonstrations by students in Bangkok are the largest revolutionary mass movement in Thailand in a decade. The surging student movement powerfully complements the armed struggle of the people in the countryside. Thus, the revolutionary struggle of the Thai people, in addition to the armed struggle that is flourishing in the vast rural areas, has begun to appear as a second front of the people's mass struggle against the American-Thai reactionaries.

The Thanon reactionary regime is a thoroughly traitorous and dictatorial regime.

In recent years, it has further sold out to American imperialism, wholeheartedly serving as a henchman for the American invasion of Vietnam, turning the entire Thailand into a military base for the Americans, and forcing the people to the battlefield in Vietnam to be cannon fodder for the American invaders. Due to the evil policies of plundering the people and expanding military preparations pursued by the Thanon traitorous clique, Thailand's fiscal deficit has increased dramatically, inflation has become more severe, and the price index has been rising continuously; last year, Thailand's agriculture suffered a poor harvest, with rice production decreasing by about 20%, and economic difficulties are becoming more serious, with the people's living conditions deteriorating rapidly. Therefore, the struggle of the people of all strata in Thailand against the pro-American traitorous dictatorship of the Thanon reactionary regime has become increasingly intense.

To maintain its reactionary rule, the Thanon traitorous clique has adopted a series of savage fascist measures, further strengthening control and suppression of the people. It has publicly banned mass demonstrations and parades based on a so-called "decree" issued ten years ago, even prohibiting gatherings of more than five people. However, the will of the Thai people to resist the aggression of American imperialism and oppose the policies of the Thanon clique that bring disaster to the country cannot be suppressed by any "decree." The revolutionary mass movement of the Thai people has been developing deeply under difficult conditions. Recently, students in Bangkok have defied the fascist "decrees" of the American-Thai reactionaries, fearlessly facing the brutal suppression of the American-Thai reactionaries, and have loudly put forward clear battle slogans such as opposing the use of Thailand as a base for the American invasion of Vietnam and opposing the Thanon traitorous clique serving as a henchman for the American invasion of Vietnam. They have taken to the streets to demonstrate and fight bravely with a large number of armed police. Although the Thanon traitorous clique has carried out bloody suppression of the demonstrating students and conducted large-scale arrests afterward, the patriotic students of Thailand have not been intimidated. Recently, new flames of struggle have risen in several schools, including Thammasat University. All this shows that the contradictions between the Thanon traitorous clique and the broad masses of the people are becoming increasingly sharp.

The just struggle of the students in Bangkok has received the enthusiastic support of the broad patriotic people of Thailand. As the "Voice of the Thai People" radio station pointed out in its commentary: "It will have a profound impact on all patriotic people and students who are willing to resist the American aggressors and the Thanon-Baphot traitorous clique, and will make the patriotic democratic struggle of the people throughout the country more widely developed." It can be predicted that while the armed revolutionary struggle of the Thai people is developing victoriously, the revolutionary mass movement of the Thai people will also continue to surge. Even the Thanon traitorous clique is worried and terrified about this. Its police chief, Praphat, has repeatedly exclaimed: "The students' demonstrations will make 'the people imitate.'" Even Thanon himself has lamented that the students' struggle will bring "serious chaos and misfortune" to their reactionary rule.

The Desperate Struggles of the American-Thai Reactionaries Cannot Save Their Failure

The American-Thai reactionaries, in order to maintain their reactionary rule, are making desperate struggles. The Thanon traitorous clique, on the one hand, with the support of American imperialism, is stepping up military actions to carry out bloody suppression of the people's armed forces; on the other hand, under the direction of American imperialism, it is issuing a fake constitution and staging a so-called "restoration of power to the people" farce to deceive the people politically. The American-Thanon clique deludes itself that it can use these two counter-revolutionary methods to extinguish the revolutionary flames of the Thai people, which is completely in vain.

Our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out during the Chinese people's liberation war: "Military suppression and political deception are the two main tools used by Chiang Kai-shek to maintain his reactionary rule. Now people have seen the rapid bankruptcy of these tools."

Today, the situation is the same for the Thanon traitorous clique. The Thai people's armed forces have grown stronger and stronger in the past two years of fighting, powerfully proving the bankruptcy of the military suppression method of the American-Thai reactionaries. The Thanon traitorous clique's savage suppression of the students in Bangkok the day after the fake constitution was issued has vividly announced the bankruptcy of its political deception method. The Thanon clique, by implementing a pro-American traitorous dictatorship policy, has placed itself in a position of enmity with the people of all strata in Thailand. It is already surrounded by the broad masses of the Thai people, and no matter how desperately it struggles, it cannot save its failure.

The Thai people are advancing victoriously on the road of revolution. With the powerful support of the revolutionary mass movement in Thailand, the armed struggle of the broad rural areas of Thailand will definitely develop further. Under the correct leadership of the Communist Party of Thailand, the Thai people will definitely unite more closely, persist in armed struggle, overcome all difficulties, and finally overthrow the dictatorial rule of the American imperialist running dog, the Thanon-Baphot clique, and establish a truly independent and democratic new Thailand!

### 泰国人民革命斗争的另一条战线

    泰国人民革命斗争的另一条战线
    最近以来，泰国学生斗争的风暴接连兴起。六月二十一日，曼谷学生举行了声势浩大的反美示威。从七月十一日开始，泰国法政大学的数千学生又展开了新的斗争。在美泰反动派的统治中心爆发大规模的学生运动，这是泰国人民爱国民主斗争的一个新发展，也是他侬—巴博卖国集团反动统治日益不稳的一个新标志。
    武装斗争的辉煌胜利推动革命的发展
    泰国共产党领导下的泰国人民革命武装斗争的胜利发展，指明了泰国人民争取解放的正确道路。泰国的革命面临着一派大好形势。
    自从一九六五年泰国人民在那空拍侬府那家县打响了武装斗争的第一枪，泰国人民革命武装斗争的烈火在泰国的大地上越烧越旺。两年多来，他侬卖国集团在美帝国主义的支持下，出动大批反动军队，使用各种现代化武器，对人民武装力量进行疯狂的镇压。但是，泰国人民武装力量发动群众、依靠群众，运用了人民战争的战略战术，一次又一次地粉碎了美泰反动派的反革命“围剿”，不断取得辉煌的胜利。在两年多的时间中，泰国人民武装力量同敌人进行了近八百次的战斗，歼灭了敌人两千多名，缴获了敌人的大批武器弹药。目前，泰国人民的武装斗争已经蔓延到全国七十一个府的三十个府，并且正在继续扩展。
    泰国人民的武装斗争，沉重地打击了美国侵略者和他侬卖国集团在泰国的反动统治，大大地鼓舞了泰国爱国人民争取民族解放的斗争意志。正是在这样的情况下，泰国人民的群众斗争出现了新的高涨。
      学生运动兴起第二条战线开始出现
    曼谷学生最近的示威游行，是十年来泰国规模最大的革命群众运动。猛烈兴起的学生运动，有力地配合了农村的人民武装斗争。这样，泰国人民的革命斗争，在广大农村地区蓬勃发展的武装斗争这一条战线以外，又开始出现了反对美泰反动派的人民群众斗争的第二条战线。
    他侬反动政权是一个彻头彻尾的卖国独裁政权。
    近年来，它进一步向美帝国主义卖身投靠，死心塌地地充当美帝侵越帮凶，使整个泰国沦为美帝的一个军事基地，并且强迫人民到越南战场为美国侵略者当炮灰。由于他侬卖国集团推行残酷掠夺人民和大肆扩军备战的罪恶政策，泰国财政赤字大量增加，通货膨胀日益加剧，物价指数不断上升；去年泰国农业歉收，大米减产达百分之二十左右，经济困难日趋严重，人民生活急剧恶化。因此，泰国各阶层人民反对亲美卖国独裁的他侬反动政权的斗争越来越强烈。
    他侬卖国集团为了维护它的反动统治，采取了一系列野蛮的法西斯措施，变本加厉地对人民加强控制和镇压。它根据十年前颁布的所谓“法令”，公然禁止群众示威游行，甚至连五人以上在一起集会也在禁止之列。但是，泰国人民反对美帝国主义的侵略和反对他侬集团祸国殃民政策的斗争意志是任何“法令”都压制不了的。泰国人民的革命群众运动，在艰苦的条件下始终在深入发展。最近，曼谷学生藐视美泰反动派的法西斯“法令”，不怕美泰反动派的残暴镇压，响亮地提出了反对美帝国主义利用泰国作为侵越基地和反对他侬卖国集团充当美帝侵越帮凶等鲜明的战斗口号，冲上街头游行示威，并且同大批武装警察英勇搏斗。尽管他侬卖国集团对示威学生进行了血腥的镇压，事后又进行大规模的逮捕，然而，泰国的爱国学生并没有被吓倒。最近，在泰国法政大学等几个学校里，又燃起了新的斗争火焰。这一切表明，他侬卖国集团同广大人民群众之间的矛盾越来越尖锐。
    曼谷学生的正义斗争，得到了泰国广大爱国人民的热烈支持。正如“泰国人民之声”电台在评论中所指出的：“它对于一切愿意反对美国侵略者和他侬—巴博卖国集团的爱国人民和学生，必将产生深远的影响，使全国人民的爱国民主斗争更广泛地开展”。可以预言，在泰国人民革命武装斗争胜利发展的同时，泰国人民的革命群众运动也必将不断高涨。连他侬卖国集团对此也忧心忡忡，惊恐万状。它的警察头子巴硕就连连惊呼：学生的示威会使“人民仿效”。连他侬本人也哀叹，学生的斗争将给他们的反动统治
  “带来严重的混乱和不幸”。
      美泰反动派垂死挣扎挽救不了它们的失败
    美泰反动派为了维持自己的反动统治，正在进行疯狂的垂死挣扎。他侬卖国集团一方面在美帝国主义的支持下，加紧军事行动，对人民武装力量进行血腥的镇压；另一方面又在美帝国主义的导演下，颁布伪宪法，策划上演所谓“还政于民”的丑剧，对人民进行政治欺骗。美国—他侬集团妄想使用反革命两手来扑灭泰国人民的革命烈火，这完全是徒劳的。
    我们的伟大导师毛主席在中国人民解放战争期间曾经指出：“军事镇压和政治欺骗，是蒋介石维持自己反动统治的两个主要工具，现在人们已经看到这些工具的迅速破产。”
    今天，对他侬卖国集团说来，情况也正是如此。泰国人民武装力量两年多来在战斗中不断成长壮大，有力地证明了美泰反动派军事镇压这一手的破产。而他侬卖国集团在伪宪法颁布的第二天就杀气腾腾地对曼谷学生进行野蛮镇压，又生动地宣告了它政治欺骗这一手的破产。他侬集团执行亲美卖国独裁政策，把自己置于同泰国各阶层人民为敌的地位。它已经处于泰国广大人民的重重包围之中，无论怎样疯狂挣扎，也挽救不了自己的失败。
    泰国人民正在革命的道路上胜利前进。在泰国革命群众运动的有力配合下，泰国广大农村的人民武装斗争一定会有更大的发展。泰国人民在泰国共产党的正确领导下，一定能够更加紧密地团结起来，坚持武装斗争，克服一切困难，最后推翻美帝国主义的走狗他侬—巴博集团的独裁统治，建立一个真正独立民主的人民新泰国！
