Fenyi County Revolutionary Committee in Jiangxi Province has fully utilized the role of non-full-time committee members who do not leave production, acting as a bridge between the committee and the masses. They have taken the initiative to shoulder the responsibilities of revolution and production on the front lines, making the work at the grassroots level better and better. The Revolutionary Committee has implemented streamlining and efficiency, further merging offices, significantly reducing the number of staff, and taking a big step forward in organizing a revolutionary and mass-connected leadership team, promoting the rapid development of revolution and production throughout the county.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, July 19th — The Fenyi County Revolutionary Committee in Jiangxi Province has followed the great leader Chairman Mao's teachings on the three-in-one combination, fully utilizing the role of non-full-time committee members who do not leave production. They rely on these members to solve many problems at the grassroots level and complete many tasks on the front lines, taking a big step forward in streamlining and efficiency, and organizing a revolutionary and mass-connected leadership team, promoting the rapid development of revolution and production throughout the county.

When the Fenyi County Revolutionary Committee was first established, it followed Chairman Mao's great teachings on streamlining and efficiency, making sweeping reforms to the old institutions. The number of staff was reduced from the original 240-plus of the county committee and county people's committee to over 80. As the role of non-full-time committee members in the Revolutionary Committee was fully utilized, the work at the grassroots level became better and better. The committee's institutions were merged from the original three departments and seventeen groups into six groups and one office, reducing the number of staff from over 80 to 45. Recently, they have seriously studied the experience of the Lingbao County Revolutionary Committee and the important editorial note in the People's Daily, summarized the experiences of the previous period, and believed that as long as they take a firm attitude, thoroughly criticize the counter-revolutionary revisionist line that China's Khrushchev promoted in the construction of political power, adhere to the mass line, and further utilize the role of non-full-time committee members, the institutions and personnel of the Revolutionary Committee can be further reduced. Therefore, they relied on the masses to further merge offices and reduce the number of staff.

Now, a new revolutionary scene has emerged in the Fenyi County Revolutionary Committee. Many non-full-time committee members distributed at the grassroots units have taken the initiative to shoulder the responsibilities of revolution and production, caring about the major affairs of the county. They rely on the masses to turn their units into models, inspiring the surrounding masses. Revolutionary Committee member and peasant Li Mingcai from Xincai Commune's Baiyun Brigade organized the masses to establish Mao Zedong Thought family study classes, family struggle against selfishness and revisionism meetings, and family blackboard newspapers, setting an example for the whole county. Vice Chairman Li Shuigen of the Revolutionary Committee is a student at Fenyi Middle School. He relies on revolutionary teachers and students not only to excel in the work of his own school but also to actively help solve problems in other schools, playing an important role in leading the work of the county's education front. Standing Committee member Lin Chunta, an ordinary worker, often works during the day and works late into the night, going to wherever there are problems on the industrial and commercial front to help solve them. Now, the 62 non-full-time committee members in the county have all done a good job in their units, becoming models for the broad masses of revolutionaries on various fronts.

To utilize the role of non-full-time committee members, first, the awareness of full-time committee members must be raised.

The Fenyi County Revolutionary Committee has deepened its understanding of the important role of non-full-time committee members through practice. Initially, some people, influenced by old ideas and habits, did not pay much attention to non-full-time committee members. When calculating the manpower of the Revolutionary Committee, they often only counted the full-time cadres, ignoring the non-full-time committee members; when facing the contradiction of too much work and too few people, they always wanted to add a few full-time personnel, not thinking about how to utilize the role of non-full-time committee members. Some even thought that non-full-time committee members could only be in charge of one point and could not bloom on a larger scale, and that truly solving the major affairs of the county still depended on full-time committee members.

These active thoughts attracted the attention of the Standing Committee of the Revolutionary Committee. They organized full-time committee members to repeatedly study Chairman Mao's great teachings on the leadership of the party and the mass line, and Chairman Mao's latest instructions: "The basic experience of the revolutionary committee has three points: one is the representative of revolutionary cadres, one is the representative of the army, and one is the representative of revolutionary masses, realizing the three-in-one combination of the revolution. The revolutionary committee should implement unified leadership, break down overlapping administrative organizations, streamline and downsize, and organize a revolutionary and mass-connected leadership team." Through study, full-time committee members compared themselves with non-full-time committee members and summarized five characteristics and five roles: first, non-full-time committee members are all representatives of revolutionary masses, closely connected with the masses, and play the best bridge role between the Revolutionary Committee and revolutionary masses; second, non-full-time committee members are all revolutionary pioneers who have emerged from the storms of class struggle, playing a leading role in promoting the victory of work in all aspects; third, non-full-time committee members live among the masses and understand the opinions and demands of the masses the best, playing the best supervisory role for the Revolutionary Committee; fourth, non-full-time committee members are the holders of the seal who do not leave the plow or hammer, playing a role in resisting bureaucratism; fifth, non-full-time committee members are both fighters and commanders, the most experienced soldiers, and can play a model role in all aspects. Full-time committee members, through these facts, deeply realized that not having non-full-time committee members in mind is actually not having the masses in sight. In the past, ignoring the role of non-full-time committee members, even treating them as decorations, is not just a general problem of awareness and work methods, but a fundamental attitude towards the masses, a major issue of whether to implement Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

To deepen the understanding of full-time committee members about the role of non-full-time committee members, the Standing Committee of the Revolutionary Committee also used some living examples to educate them. For example, when full-time committee members encountered difficult problems in their work, they organized them to go to the grassroots level to learn and consult with non-full-time committee members. The full-time committee member in charge of rural areas had no way to help backward brigades, so the Standing Committee organized them to go to Liangqiao Commune where non-full-time committee member Li Chunya was located. They saw with their own eyes how Li Chunya used the "one helps one, one pair of reds" method to lead the revolutionary movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao Zedong Thought in his own Red Flag Brigade, quickly bringing the backward brigade into the ranks of advanced units. Full-time committee members further realized the role of non-full-time committee members through this incident.

Respect the pioneering spirit of non-full-time committee members, continuously improving their enthusiasm for participating in the construction of political power.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Without destruction, there can be no construction. Destruction is criticism and revolution. Destruction must be reasoned, and reasoning is construction. With destruction as the main focus, construction is also within it." After criticizing various incorrect understandings in their leadership thinking, the Fenyi County Revolutionary Committee established a new trend of correctly treating non-full-time committee members and proposed many good methods to encourage non-full-time committee members to fully utilize their roles.

The Revolutionary Committee, based on the characteristics of non-full-time committee members having the fewest constraints and being the most creative, first of all, wholeheartedly believed in them, relied on them, and actively supported them to work boldly, continuously improving their enthusiasm for participating in the construction of proletarian revolutionary political power. The county Revolutionary Committee adopted the methods of "inviting them up" and "going to them" to promote the advanced experiences of 12 non-full-time committee members and their units, which played a significant role in inspiring their revolutionary enthusiasm. Peng Pinghou, an old poor peasant from Jiaoqiao Commune's Shangcun Brigade, was deeply resentful and had a high sense of responsibility after being elected as a member of the county Revolutionary Committee. But he was worried about his low education and lack of experience, fearing that he could not play a role. In response to this active thought, the Revolutionary Committee invited Peng Pinghou to give a speech at a county-wide four-level cadre meeting with over 4,000 people, using his bitter experiences of oppression and exploitation in the old society to conduct a class education on remembering bitterness and thinking sweetness for the revolutionary cadres. Many cadres were moved to tears, and some checked their own mistakes of forgetting class bitterness and slacking off. This speech played a good role in improving the class struggle awareness and two-line struggle awareness of the revolutionary cadres, and also gave Peng Pinghou great inspiration. Since then, Peng Pinghou's enthusiasm for caring about the major affairs of the county has been increasing. In the revolutionary criticism, he and the revolutionary masses created the good experience of "three remembrances and three criticisms" of remembering family history, field history, and village history, and family criticism, field criticism, and courtyard criticism, promoting the in-depth development of the revolutionary criticism throughout the county. Peng Huiying, a female commune member and old revolutionary cadre from the revolutionary base area of Songshan Commune's Qiaobian Brigade, never forgot the revolutionary tradition after being elected as a member of the county Revolutionary Committee. Although she was over 70 years old, she insisted on not taking a car and walking barefoot in straw sandals for over 30 miles when she went to the county for a meeting, spreading Mao Zedong Thought wherever she passed. The Standing Committee of the Revolutionary Committee considered this a pioneering act and widely promoted it at large and small meetings. Her revolutionary spirit was admired by the revolutionary cadres throughout the county, and her experience quickly spread throughout the county.

The Standing Committee of the Fenyi County Revolutionary Committee also consciously entrusted some important tasks to non-full-time committee members, letting them "stand at one point and face the whole county," continuously improving their leadership level in practice. Non-full-time committee member Peng Gao'er is a cadre from Songjia Brigade of Shuanglin Commune. He was very concerned about the revolutionization of the leadership team of the county Revolutionary Committee and had made many beneficial suggestions on implementing the latest instructions of the great leader Chairman Mao on "the revolutionary committee should implement unified leadership, break down overlapping administrative organizations, streamline and downsize, and organize a revolutionary and mass-connected leadership team." He also set an example in this regard. The Standing Committee believed that relying on him to promote the revolutionization of the county Revolutionary Committee leadership team would definitely have a good effect. Therefore, they moved the Mao Zedong Thought study class on implementing streamlining and efficiency held by the county Revolutionary Committee to Songjia Brigade. Peng Gao'er actively undertook this important task. Considering that the participants in this Mao Zedong Thought study class were all cadres from the original county committee and county people's committee, who were influenced by old ideas and habits to varying degrees and needed a good revolution, he boldly mobilized poor and lower-middle peasants to give classes to the cadres, letting the cadres and poor and lower-middle peasants together severely criticize the counter-revolutionary revisionist line that China's Khrushchev promoted in the construction of political power. The poor and lower-middle peasants understood Chairman Mao's instructions the deepest, had the strongest demand for streamlining and efficiency, and hated the bureaucratism of the old institutions the most. These gave the cadres a very profound education, playing a significant role in solving the ideological problems of the cadres and further promoting the work of streamlining and efficiency. Through this practice, Peng Gao'er also improved a lot, and his desire to hold power well for the proletariat became stronger.

Now, among the non-full-time committee members of the Fenyi County Revolutionary Committee, a new scene of "four more" has emerged: more and more become active learners and appliers of Mao Zedong Thought, more and more actively care about the major affairs of the county, more and more actively request to undertake tasks, and more and more actively make suggestions to the Revolutionary Committee. The Standing Committee members deeply felt that: the enthusiasm of the committee members has been fully mobilized, and our work has become easier.

Pay attention to the training and improvement work of non-full-time committee members, making them play a greater role in the proletarian revolutionary cause.

The Fenyi County Revolutionary Committee regards enthusiastically helping and training non-full-time committee members as a major task of nurturing new things. They have done a lot of work and adopted many effective methods in this regard.

The Revolutionary Committee, based on the characteristic of non-full-time committee members being scattered in various grassroots units, divided the county into four areas, with Standing Committee members going to the grassroots level in each area, staying in one place and covering a wide area. The Standing Committee often held meetings with non-full-time committee members in the area to exchange experiences in studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, convey the instructions of higher authorities and the work opinions of the Standing Committee, and jointly study and implement them. In the work process, they paid attention to combining the old and the new, learning from each other, and leading troops on the front line. When establishing the leadership team, Shuanglin Commune encountered great resistance. The Standing Committee member who went to assist the work in this commune, together with the two non-full-time committee members there, studied the contradictions using the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, found the root of the problem, and greatly accelerated the solution of the problem, quickly establishing the commune leadership team. The two non-full-time committee members deeply felt that: leading troops on the front line is good, visible, and tangible, and it is very beneficial to us.

When non-full-time committee members encountered difficulties in their work, the Standing Committee would go to the units where the non-full-time committee members were located to enthusiastically help and fully support them. Non-full-time committee member Yan Yuzhu is a young doctor at the county people's hospital. She followed Chairman Mao's instructions on "putting the focus of medical and health work in the countryside" to focus on cleaning up the class ranks and facing the countryside. A small handful of class enemies secretly carried out sabotage and disruption, greatly affecting the work of the hospital. At this critical moment, a Standing Committee member came here, actively supported Yan Yuzhu, and helped her rely on the masses to root out the small handful of class enemies, removing the stumbling blocks on the road to progress.

The Fenyi County Revolutionary Committee also, according to the tasks of each period and the active thoughts of the committee members, held Mao Zedong Thought study classes to train non-full-time committee members distributed in grassroots units. Since the establishment of the Revolutionary Committee, all non-full-time committee members have studied in Mao Zedong Thought study classes for two to three times. The study classes held by the communes to implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions also tried to absorb them to participate, letting them be both teachers and students. For the shortcomings of non-full-time committee members and the problems that appeared in their work, the Revolutionary Committee also strictly demanded and did not relax. As soon as the Revolutionary Committee was established, it made ten regulations for the revolutionization of the Revolutionary Committee and distributed them to all full-time and non-full-time committee members, requiring them to strictly implement them without exception. The Revolutionary Committee also mobilized the revolutionary masses to criticize and supervise the work of the committee members. In this way, everyone could strictly demand of themselves, place themselves under the supervision of the masses, and take root among the masses.

    充分发挥不脱离生产的革委会委员的作用
    加强同群众的联系，促进领导班子革命化
    江西分宜县革委会的不脱产委员发挥了革委会和群众之间的桥梁作用，在第一线主动挑起革命和生产重担，基层工作越做越好。革委会实行精兵简政，进一步合并了办事机构，机关工作人员大大减少，朝着组织起一个革命化的联系群众的领导班子前进了一大步，推动了全县革命和生产的迅猛发展
    新华社南昌十九日电　江西省分宜县革命委员会遵循伟大领袖毛主席关于革命三结合的教导，充分发挥不脱离生产的革委会委员的作用，依靠他们在基层解决许多问题，在第一线完成许多工作，使革委会在实行精兵简政，组织起一个革命化的联系群众的领导班子的大道上迈进了一大步，推动了全县革命和生产的迅猛发展。
    分宜县革委会刚成立时，就遵照毛主席“精兵简政”的伟大教导，对旧机构进行了大刀阔斧的改革，工作人员由原县委、县人委的二百四十多人减少到八十多人。随着不脱产委员在革委会中的作用得到充分发挥，基层工作越做越好，革委会的机构又由原来的三部十七组合并为六组一室，工作人员由八十多人减少到四十五人。最近，他们认真学习了灵宝县革委会的经验和《人民日报》的重要编者按，总结了前段的经验，认为只要采取坚决态度，彻底批判中国赫鲁晓夫在政权建设方面所推行的反革命修正主义路线，坚持群众路线，进一步发挥不脱产委员的作用，革委会的机构和人员还可以再减。于是，他们又依靠群众，进一步合并了办事机构，减少了工作人员。
    现在，分宜县革委会出现一派革命化的新景象。分布在基层单位的许多不脱产委员，主动挑起革命和生产的重担，关心全县大事。他们充分依靠群众，把自己所在单位办成样板，带动周围群众。革委会委员、新祉公社白芸大队社员李明才，发动群众大办毛泽东思想家庭学习班、家庭斗私批修会和家庭黑板报，成了全县学习的榜样。革委会副主任李水根，是分宜中学的学生，他依靠革命师生除把自己所在的学校的工作搞得非常出色外，还主动到其他学校帮助解决问题，对搞好全县文教战线的领导工作起了重要作用。常委林春牙是个普通工人，经常是白天坚持劳动，晚上工作到深夜，工交战线上那里出现问题，他就到那里去帮助解决。现在，全县六十二个不脱产委员所在的单位，工作都做得很好，成为各条战线广大革命群众学习的典型。
    要发挥不脱产委员的作用，
    先要提高脱产委员的认识
    分宜县革委会对不脱产委员的重要作用，是在实践过程中不断加深认识的。开始，有些人由于受旧观念、旧习惯的影响，对不脱产委员总不是那么重视。他们在计算革委会的人手时，常常是只算脱产干部，丢了不脱产委员；遇到事情多、人手少的矛盾时，总想增加几个脱产人员，不想如何发挥不脱产委员的作用。有的甚至认为，不脱产委员只能在点上当家，不能在面上开花，真正解决全县大事，还得靠脱产委员。
    这些活思想，引起了革委会常委的重视。他们组织脱产委员反复学习毛主席关于党的领导和群众路线的伟大教导，学习毛主席的最新指示：“革命委员会的基本经验有三条：一条是有革命干部的代表，一条是有军队的代表，一条是有革命群众的代表，实现了革命的三结合。革命委员会要实行一元化的领导，打破重叠的行政机构，精兵简政，组织起一个革命化的联系群众的领导班子。”通过学习，脱产委员对比自己，给不脱产委员总结了五大特点、五大作用：一、不脱产委员都是革命群众的代表，他们和群众息息相关，心心相连，起着革委会和革命群众之间最好的桥梁作用；二、不脱产委员都是在阶级斗争大风大浪中冲杀出来的革命闯将，在推动各方面工作胜利前进中起着带头作用；三、不脱产委员生活在群众之中，最了解群众的意见和要求，对革委会能起到最好的监督作用；四、不脱产委员是不离锄把子、锤把子的掌印者，对官僚主义莠草能起抵制作用；五、不脱产委员既是战斗员，又是指挥员，是最有实践经验的战士，在各方面最能起到模范作用。脱产委员通过这些事实深切地认识到：心里没有不脱产委员，实际上是眼里没有群众。过去忽视不脱产委员的作用，甚至把他们看作是陪衬，这绝不是什么一般的认识问题和工作方法问题，而是对待群众的根本态度问题，是执行不执行毛主席无产阶级革命路线的大问题。
      为了加深脱产委员对不脱产委员的作用的认识，革委会常委还通过一些活典型，对他们进行教育。例如，脱产委员在工作中遇到了难解决的问题，就组织他们到基层去学习，向不脱产委员请教。分管农村的脱产委员对帮助后进队缺少办法，常委就组织他们下到不脱产委员李春牙所在的杨桥公社。他们亲眼看到，李春牙运用“一帮一、一对红”的办法，以他自己所在的红旗大队带动邻近的建陂大队开展活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动，在很短时间内就使这个后进队迅速跃入了先进行列。脱产委员通过这件事进一步认识到不脱产委员的作用。
    尊重不脱产委员的首创精神，
    不断提高他们参加政权建设的积极性
    毛主席教导我们：“不破不立。破，就是批判，就是革命。破，就要讲道理，讲道理就是立，破字当头，立也就在其中了。”分宜县革命委员会在领导思想上批判了各种不正确的认识以后，就立起了正确对待不脱产委员的新风尚，提出了许多鼓励不脱产委员充分发挥作用的好办法。
    县革委会根据不脱产委员最少框框、最富于创造性的特点，首先是满腔热情地相信他们，依靠他们，积极支持他们大胆工作，不断提高他们参加无产阶级革命政权建设的积极性。县革委会采取“请上来”和“走上门”的办法，先后推广了十二个不脱产委员和他们所在单位的先进经验，对激发他们的革命积极性起了很大作用。界桥公社上村大队苦大仇深的老贫农彭平厚，当选县革委会委员后，掌权的积极性很高。但他耽心自己文化低，经验少，不能起到作用。针对这个活思想，革委会就请彭平厚在一次全县四千多人的四级干部大会上作报告，以他在旧社会受压迫、受剥削的苦难经历，向广大革命干部进行忆苦思甜的阶级教育。许多干部听了他的报告感动得痛哭流涕，有的人当场检查了自己忘记阶级苦和松劲退坡等错误思想。这次报告，对提高广大革命干部的阶级斗争觉悟和两条路线斗争觉悟起了很好的作用，也使彭平厚得到了很大启发。从此以后，彭平厚关心全县大事的积极性越来越高。在革命大批判中，他和革命群众一起，创造了忆家史、忆田史、忆村史和家庭批、田头批、屋场批的“三忆三批”的好经验，推动了全县革命大批判的深入发展。松山公社桥边大队女社员、革命老根据地的老革命干部彭会英，当选县革委会委员后，时刻不忘革命传统。她虽已七十多岁，一次到县里开会仍然坚持不坐车，赤脚穿草鞋，步行三十多里，路过那里就在那里宣传毛泽东思想。革委会常委认为这是一个创举，就在大小会议上广为传播。她的革命精神受到全县革命干部的钦佩，她的经验也很快在全县传开。
    分宜县革委会常委还有意识地交给不脱产委员一些工作重担，让他们“站在一点，面向全县”，在实践中不断提高领导水平。不脱产委员彭高二，是双林公社宋家大队的干部。他对县革委会领导班子的革命化非常关心，对落实伟大领袖毛主席“革命委员会要实行一元化的领导，打破重叠的行政机构，精兵简政，组织起一个革命化的联系群众的领导班子”的最新指示，提出过许多有益的建议。他还以身作则，在这方面作了很多努力。常委认为，依靠他来促进县革委会领导班子的革命化，一定会起到很好的作用。于是，就把县革委会举办的实行精兵简政的毛泽东思想学习班，搬到宋家大队去办。彭高二积极地承担了这个重大任务。他考虑到参加这次毛泽东思想学习班的都是原县委、县人委的干部，他们不同程度地受了旧观念、旧习惯的影响，需要很好地革一革命，于是就大胆地动员贫下中农给干部们上课，让干部和贫下中农一道狠批中国赫鲁晓夫在政权建设方面推行的反革命修正主义路线。贫下中农对毛主席的指示理解得最深，对精兵简政的要求最强烈，对旧机构的官僚主义最痛恨。这些，给干部们以极深刻的教育，对解决干部的思想问题和进一步推动精兵简政的工作起了很大作用。彭高二通过这一实践也得到了很大提高，为无产阶级掌好权用好权的愿望也越加强烈。
    现在，在分宜县革委会的不脱产委员中，出现了“四多”的新景象：成为活学活用毛泽东思想积极分子的越来越多，主动关心全县大事的越来越多，主动要求承担任务的越来越多，向革委会提倡议的越来越多。常委们深有体会地说：委员们的积极性充分调动起来了，我们的工作也好做了。
    重视对不脱产委员的培养和提高工作，
    使他们在无产阶级革命事业中发挥更大作用
    分宜县革委会把热情帮助和培养不脱产委员，看成是一件扶植新生事物的大事。他们在这方面作了许多工作，采取了许多有效办法。
    革委会根据不脱产委员分散在各基层单位的特点，把全县划为四个片，常委分片下到基层，蹲点跑面。常委经常在片上召开不脱产委员的碰头会，交流活学活用毛泽东思想的经验，向不脱产委员们传达上级指示和常委的工作意见，与大家共同研究贯彻。在工作过程中，注意做到新老结合，互学互帮，在火线上带兵。双林公社在建立领导班子的时候，遇到了很大阻力。下到这个公社协助工作的常委，就和在那里的两位不脱产委员一起研究，用战无不胜的毛泽东思想分析矛盾，找出问题的症结，大大加速了问题的解决，很快建立了公社领导班子。两位不脱产委员深有体会地说：火线带兵好，看得见，摸得着，对我们大有提高。
    当不脱产委员在工作中遇到困难的时候，常委就到不脱产委员所在的单位热情帮助，全力支持。不脱产委员严玉珠，是县人民医院的青年医生。她遵照毛主席“把医疗卫生工作的重点放到农村去”的指示，大抓清理阶级队伍和面向农村的工作。一小撮阶级敌人暗中进行破坏和捣乱，使医院的工作受到很大影响。正在这个时候，一位常委来到这里，积极为严玉珠撑腰，并帮助她充分依靠群众，把一小撮阶级敌人挖了出来，扫除了前进道路上的绊脚石。
    分宜县革委会还根据各个时期的任务和委员们的活思想，举办毛泽东思想学习班，轮训分布在基层单位的不脱产委员。革委会成立以来，所有不脱产委员都已到毛泽东思想学习班学习过二到三次。公社举办的落实毛主席最新指示的学习班，也尽量吸收他们参加，让他们既当教员，又当学员。对于不脱产委员的缺点和在工作中出现的问题，革委会也是严格要求，毫不放松。革委会一成立，就作出了革委会实现革命化的十项规定，并印发给全体脱产的和不脱产的委员，要求他们毫无例外地坚决执行。革委会还发动广大革命群众对委员们的工作进行批评和监督。这样，就使得大家都能严格要求自己，置身于群众监督之下，扎根于群众之中。
