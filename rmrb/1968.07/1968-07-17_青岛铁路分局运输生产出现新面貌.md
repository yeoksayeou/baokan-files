The revolutionary committee of the Qingdao Railway Bureau of the Jinan Railway Bureau, with the help of the People's Liberation Army's leftist support personnel, has braved the storms of class struggle. In implementing the great leader Chairman Mao's great line of "grasp revolution, promote production," they have always prioritized revolution, used revolution to guide production, and the revolutionary and production situations throughout the bureau have become increasingly better. In the first half of the year, they completed the freight and passenger transport tasks seven and ten days ahead of schedule, respectively. In June, the average daily loading volume increased by 46% compared to January, and the total transportation volume increased by 47% compared to January, setting a new record since the Cultural Revolution.

In the process of grasping the revolution and promoting production, the revolutionary committee of the Qingdao Railway Bureau has always placed a high priority on the revolutionary criticism. They summarized and promoted the experience of the Fangzi Station Revolutionary Committee, quickly spreading the wave of revolutionary criticism throughout the bureau. Through the revolutionary criticism, the broad revolutionary staff have received profound education, raised their awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines, united more strongly to launch an attack on a handful of class enemies, further consolidated the revolutionary great alliance and the revolutionary three-in-one combination, and ensured the normal operation of trains.

    青岛铁路分局运输生产出现新面貌
    济南铁路局青岛分局革命委员会，在人民解放军支左人员帮助下，迎着阶级斗争的大风大浪，在贯彻执行伟大领袖毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针中，始终把革命放在首位，用革命统帅生产，全分局革命和生产的形势越来越好，上半年分别提前七天和十天完成了货运和客运任务。六月份每天平均装车量比一月份增加百分之四十六，总运输量比一月份增加百分之四十七，创造了文化大革命以来的最高纪录。
    青岛铁路分局革命委员会在抓革命促生产中，始终把革命大批判放在重要地位。他们总结推广了坊子站革委会的经验，迅速地把革命大批判的浪潮席卷到分局的每一个角落。广大革命职工从革命大批判中受到深刻的教育，提高了阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟，团结起来更有力地向一小撮阶级敌人展开进攻，进一步巩固了革命的大联合和革命的三结合，保证了列车的正常行驶。
