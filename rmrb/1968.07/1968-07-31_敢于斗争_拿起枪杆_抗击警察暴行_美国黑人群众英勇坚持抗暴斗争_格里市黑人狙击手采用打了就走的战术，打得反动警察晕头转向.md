American black masses bravely persist in anti-violence struggle

Garry city black snipers use the tactic of hitting and running, striking the reactionary police into confusion

New China News Agency, July 30th: Washington reports: Black masses in Garry, Indiana, and the Great Falls, Michigan, despite the reactionary authorities' large-scale arrests and brutal suppression, continue to bravely persist in their struggle.

On the night of the 28th, black snipers in Garry city completely ignored the reactionary authorities' curfew order and engaged in fierce gun battles with the police. The black snipers, imitating the black masses in Cleveland, used the tactic of hitting and running, striking the reactionary police into confusion. The panicked reactionary authorities hurriedly summoned a large number of police from the state capital of Indiana, Indianapolis, and the neighboring state of Illinois, Cook County, to suppress the situation. However, on the night of the 29th, black snipers again opened fire on the police in the center of Garry city. In one place, sniper bullets shattered the windshield of a police car. Meanwhile, a large number of blacks rushed into the streets, smashing white racist stores and cars to pieces. The city's police chief was desperate, exclaiming, "The situation is worsening, and disturbances are breaking out everywhere."

In Great Falls, Michigan, despite the reactionary authorities' brutal suppression of the black masses, the Associated Press had to admit that even with over 200 police patrolling a square mile, they could not cope with the blacks' tactic of throwing Molotov cocktails and then running away.

In Seattle, Washington, on the night of the 29th, two fascist police officers, riding in a police car, were showing off their might in the black district. Black snipers angrily shot at them, and the two police officers were injured and fled in disarray.

Since black people in Cleveland took up arms to bravely resist police brutality, armed anti-violence struggles have rapidly increased across the United States. According to the British Daily Mail, many black veterans have also actively joined the anti-violence struggle. Recently, in Cleveland, black people fighting against the police included black veterans returning from South Vietnam.

    格里市黑人狙击手采用打了就走的战术，打得反动警察晕头转向
    新华社三十日讯　华盛顿消息：美国印第安纳州格里市和密执安州大瀑布城等地的黑人群众，不顾反动当局的大规模逮捕和残酷镇压，继续英勇坚持斗争。
    二十八日晚，格里市的黑人狙击手们，根本不理睬反动当局宣布宵禁的命令，同警察发生了激烈的枪战。黑人狙击手们仿效克利夫兰市黑人群众采取的打了就走的战术，打得反动警察晕头转向。惊慌失措的反动当局连忙从印第安纳州的首府印第安纳波利斯和邻州伊利诺斯州的库克县调了大批警察前去镇压。但是二十九日晚黑人狙击手又在格里市中心周围向警察猛烈开火。在一处地方狙击手的枪弹还把一辆警车的挡风玻璃打得粉碎。与此同时，大批黑人又涌上街头，把白人种族主义者的一些商店和汽车砸个稀巴烂。这个市的警察头子急得直叫，“局势正在恶化，到处都爆发了动乱”。
    在密执安州的大瀑布城，尽管反动当局对黑人群众进行残酷的镇压，但是合众国际社不得不承认，即使在一平方英里的区域里有二百名以上的警察巡逻，仍然无法应付黑人扔了燃烧瓶就走的战术。
    在华盛顿州的西雅图市，二十九日晚两名法西斯警察乘坐一辆警车在黑人区耀武扬威地巡逻时，黑人狙击手愤怒地向他们射击，这两名警察被打伤后狼狈逃窜。
    从克利夫兰市黑人拿起枪杆英勇地抗击警察的暴行以来，美国各地的武力抗暴斗争迅速增加。据英国《每日邮报》报道，许多黑人退伍军人也积极地投入了抗暴斗争，最近在克利夫兰市和警察战斗的黑人中，就有从南越回来的黑人退伍军人。
