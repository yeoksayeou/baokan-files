Bangkok's student struggle storm has resurged. Thousands of students from Thammasat University and other institutions have gone on strike and demonstrated to protest against the reactionary education system. The Thanom selling-out clique is terrified and anxious, fearing that the student movement will spark broader mass struggles.

	MANILA, July 17 (Xinhua) — Following the massive demonstration on June 21 by thousands of students in Bangkok against U.S. imperialism's aggression in Vietnam and the Thanom selling-out clique's role as U.S. imperialism's lackey, thousands of students from Thammasat University recently held another demonstration and strike.

	According to Thai newspapers, on July 11 and 12, thousands of students at Thammasat University held demonstrations and rallies within the campus, protesting against the school administration's unreasonable teaching system and demanding the establishment of a "Student Union." It is reported that these students have been on strike since July 11.

	Thai newspapers also revealed that students from the Chulalongkorn University of Technology also held demonstrations, protesting against the unreasonable teaching system.

	The continuous student struggles in Thailand have made the Thanom selling-out clique extremely anxious. On July 15, the puppet police chief, Phao, spoke to the press, expressing great concern that the struggles in these two schools might lead the "people to emulate" and spark broader mass revolutionary struggles.

	Thai newspapers also revealed that the puppet regime's Ministry of Defense recently issued an order to the military, prohibiting soldiers from leaving the barracks and implementing a state of alert to deal with potential "disturbances." At the same time, they tightened control over the Thai military, fearing that soldiers might join the mass struggles.

    新华社十七日讯　曼谷消息：继六月二十一日曼谷数千学生举行盛大的反对美帝国主义侵略越南和反对他侬卖国集团充当美帝帮凶的示威游行之后，泰国政法大学数千名学生最近又举行了示威游行和罢课。
    据泰国报纸透露，七月十一日和十二日，泰国政法大学学生数千人在校园内举行示威游行和集会，抗议学校当局推行的不合理的教学制度，要求成立“大学生协会”。据报道，这些学生已从十一日开始罢课。
    泰国报纸还透露，泰国童吗哈密技术学院的学生也举行了示威游行，抗议不合理的教学制度。
    泰国学生斗争的连续发生，已使他侬卖国集团惊恐不安。泰国傀儡警察总监巴硕十五日对报界发表谈话时，非常担心这两个学校学生的斗争，会使“人民仿效”发生更广泛的群众革命斗争。
    泰国报纸还透露，傀儡集团国防部最近曾向三军发出通令，禁止士兵离开军营，实行戒备，以应付可能发生的所谓“动乱事件”，同时加紧对泰国军队的控制，担心士兵参加群众的斗争。（附图片）
