The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in the rural areas of Shanghai's suburbs, filled with boundless love and loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, enthusiastically delivered oilseed rape to the state, contributing their strength to the socialist revolution and socialist construction. They have already exceeded the state's procurement quotas for oilseed rape, with the amount delivered this year being more than 10 percent higher than the total for the previous year. The oilseed rape delivered is full of seeds, has low moisture content, few impurities, and a high oil content.

    上海农村超额完成油菜籽交售任务
    上海郊区农村广大贫下中农，满怀对伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱、无限忠诚的无产阶级感情，踊跃向国家交售油菜籽，为社会主义革命和社会主义建设贡献力量。他们已经超额完成了向国家交售油菜籽的任务，入库量比去年全年增加了百分之十以上，交售的油菜籽，籽粒饱满，水份低，杂质少，含油率高。
