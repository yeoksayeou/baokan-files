In the triumphant songs of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, our great leader Chairman Mao's latest directives on educational revolution have been issued. Chairman Mao has once again pointed the way forward for us young students.

Chairman Mao profoundly points out: "Universities should still be run, and here I mainly refer to universities of science and engineering. However, the school system should be shortened, education should be revolutionized, and proletarian politics should be in command. The path of Shanghai Machine Tool Factory in training technical personnel from among workers should be followed. Students should be selected from among workers and peasants with practical experience, sent to school for a few years, and then returned to production practice."

Chairman Mao's great call is our great battle program for carrying the proletarian educational revolution through to the end, a long-term plan for opposing revisionism and preventing restoration. It completely pronounces the death sentence on the revisionist educational line of the Chinese Khrushchev!

School education is an important front in the struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie for restoration and counter-restoration. Over the past more than ten years since liberation, the Chinese Khrushchev, the biggest capitalist-roader within the Party, has, in order to restore capitalism, vigorously promoted the revisionist educational line, cultivating successors to the bourgeoisie. It was he who advocated that "our goal should be to cultivate people to the level of being able to serve as cadres, technicians, and engineers," to cultivate "factory directors, workshop directors, Party committee secretaries, mayors, and county magistrates," and to corrupt our youth with bourgeois ideas of fame and wealth; it was he who openly enticed students to "strive for higher education, the higher the better," peddling the exploitative class ideology of "those who labor with their minds rule over others, and those who labor with their strength are ruled over by others"; it was he who repeatedly told students to "hear nothing outside the window, read only the classics," luring us into burying ourselves in books day and night; it was he who stubbornly defended the old educational system and opposed the proletarian educational revolution.

In the past, a handful of capitalist-roaders within our school usurped the Party, government, financial, and cultural powers. They colluded with traitors, spies, and unrepentant landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, monopolizing the school's lecterns. They used the socialist lecterns to serve the restoration of capitalism, doing everything they could to oppose our study of Chairman Mao's works, to oppose our participation in the three great revolutionary movements, and to peddle the black goods of feudalism, capitalism, and revisionism. In the courses we studied in our department, Mao Zedong's revolutionary educational thought was not made the main subject, and the actual practice of the Chinese educational revolution was not studied. Instead, capitalist and revisionist goods were studied. These textbooks were tedious and outdated, seriously out of touch with reality, and their content was reactionary. Some bourgeois intellectuals also taught us "scholarly methods," leading us down the wrong path of dead reading.

We were thus educated from elementary school to university, a total of sixteen or seventeen years, over twenty years without seeing rice, wheat, beans, millet, or sorghum, without seeing how workers work, without seeing how peasants farm, without seeing how commodities are exchanged. We only read books to death, ruining our health. Some classmates from working-class backgrounds, in the bourgeois dye vat, gradually changed their thoughts and feelings, forgot class struggle, forgot their roots, looked down on the working people, and no longer wanted to be workers or peasants. They thought they were great, with their tails held high. It was thus that the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in the Normal University used soft knives to cut people, leading us down the wrong path of detachment from proletarian politics, detachment from the masses of workers and peasants, and detachment from production practice, cultivating bourgeois "spiritual nobles" and laying the social foundation for their restoration of capitalism.

Looking back on the more than twenty years we have walked, we deeply feel that education must be revolutionized. The proletarian educational revolution is a matter of cultivating what kind of successors, a matter of whether our Party and state will change color. The bitter history of the restoration of capitalism in the Soviet Union must not be repeated in our country. We must take Chairman Mao's latest directives as sharp ideological weapons, thoroughly criticize the Chinese Khrushchev's revisionist educational line, uproot the revisionist nursery, dig out the revisionist poisonous roots, criticize rightist conservatism, reformism, and crawlingism in the educational revolution, repel the resistance of the old forces of the exploiting classes, and resolutely carry the proletarian educational revolution through to the end.

We are victims of the old educational system. Compared with the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers of our age, we are far behind in both ideological revolution and practical work ability. What should we do? There is only one way out, that is, to lay down the airs of university students, to be humble students of workers, peasants, and soldiers, to resolutely follow the path of combining with workers, peasants, and soldiers as pointed out by Chairman Mao, and to quickly catch up with the magnificent strides of the hundreds of millions of revolutionary people.

We are about to graduate and be assigned jobs. After graduation, will we continue to be intellectuals detached from proletarian politics, detached from the masses, and detached from productive labor, or will we be ordinary laborers and go to the workers and peasants to thoroughly reform ourselves? A severe test is before us. Various bourgeois ideas in society are attacking us, such as "university students becoming workers or peasants is a waste of talent" and "university students going to the countryside is a waste of talent." In the face of this sharp test, Chairman Mao's latest directives have given us great strength. We are determined to make a thorough break with the ideas of the exploiting classes, to thoroughly criticize the Chinese Khrushchev's revisionist educational line, to become ordinary workers and peasants, to roll in the mud, to get covered in oil, and to spend our lives combining with workers, peasants, and soldiers.

The direction has been pointed out, and the road is boundless. Graduating comrades, let us closely follow our great leader Chairman Mao, pack our bags, go to the countryside, go to the border areas, go to the factories and mines, go to the grassroots, become workers and peasants, and forever be humble students of workers, peasants, and soldiers!

    放下大学生架子，甘当工农兵小学生
    北京师范大学教育系一九六七届全体毕业生
    在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的凯歌声中，我们伟大领袖毛主席关于教育革命的最新指示发表了，毛主席又一次为我们青年学生指明了前进方向。
    毛主席深刻地指出：“大学还是要办的，我这里主要说的是理工科大学还要办，但学制要缩短，教育要革命，要无产阶级政治挂帅，走上海机床厂从工人中培养技术人员的道路。要从有实践经验的工人农民中间选拔学生，到学校学几年以后，又回到生产实践中去。”毛主席的伟大号召，是我们将无产阶级教育革命进行到底的伟大战斗纲领，是反修防修的百年大计，它彻底宣判了中国赫鲁晓夫修正主义教育路线的死刑！
    学校教育是资产阶级复辟与无产阶级反复辟的重要战线。解放十多年来，中国赫鲁晓夫这个党内最大的走资派，为了复辟资本主义，竭力推行修正主义教育路线，培养资产阶级接班人。就是他，鼓吹什么“我们的目标应培养到能当干部，当技术员，当工程师的水平”，要培养什么“厂长、车间主任、党委书记、市长、县长”等等，用资产阶级名利思想腐蚀我们青年；就是他，公开引诱学生“力求升学，升学最好”，贩卖“劳心者治人，劳力者治于人”的剥削阶级思想；就是他，多次要学生“两耳不闻窗外事，一心只读圣贤书”，引诱我们青年成天埋头于书本；就是他，顽固维护旧教育制度，反对无产阶级教育革命。
    过去，我校党内一小撮走资派篡夺了学校党政财文大权。他们招降纳叛，与叛徒、特务，没有改造好的地、富、反、坏、右分子勾结在一起，垄断了学校的讲台。他们利用社会主义的讲台为资本主义复辟服务，千方百计地反对我们学习毛主席著作，反对我们参加三大革命运动，大肆贩卖封建主义、资本主义、修正主义的黑货。在我们教育系所学的课程中，根本不把毛主席的教育革命思想作为主课，不去研究中国教育革命的实际，而是去学习资本主义和修正主义的货色。这些教材，烦琐陈旧，严重脱离实际，而且内容反动。一些资产阶级知识分子还向我们传授什么“治学方法”，把我们引上死读书本的邪路。
    我们就这样从小学到大学，一共十六、七年，二十多年中看不见稻、粱、菽、麦、黍、稷，看不见工人怎样做工，看不见农民怎样种田，看不见商品是怎样交换的。只是死读书，把身体也搞坏了，真是害死人。一些出身劳动人民的同学，在资产阶级的大染缸里，有的思想感情也逐渐起了变化，忘记了阶级斗争，忘了本，看不起劳动人民，也不再愿当工人、农民了，自以为了不起，尾巴翘到天上去了。中国赫鲁晓夫及其在师大的代理人就是这样用软刀子割人，把我们引上脱离无产阶级政治，脱离工农群众，脱离生产实践的邪路，培养资产阶级“精神贵族”，为其复辟资本主义打好社会基础。
    回顾二十多年来走过的道路，我们深切体会到，教育不革命不得了。无产阶级教育革命，是关系到培养什么样的接班人的问题，关系到我们党和国家变不变颜色的问题。苏联复辟资本主义的惨痛历史，决不能在我国重演。我们必须以毛主席的最新指示为锐利思想武器，彻底批判中国赫鲁晓夫修正主义教育路线，铲除修正主义苗圃，挖掉修正主义毒根，批判教育革命中的右倾保守主义、改良主义、爬行主义，击退剥削阶级旧势力的抵抗，坚决把无产阶级教育革命进行到底。
    我们是旧教育制度的受害者。我们与同年龄的广大工农兵青年相比，无论在思想革命化方面，还是在实际工作能力方面，都大大落后了。怎么办？出路只有一条，那就是放下大学生架子，甘当工农兵的小学生，坚决走毛主席指出的同工农兵结合的道路，迅速赶上亿万革命人民前进的雄伟步伐。
    当前我们就要毕业分配了。毕业后，是继续当脱离无产阶级政治、脱离群众、脱离生产劳动的知识分子，还是当普通劳动者，到工农中去彻底改造自己？严峻的考验摆到了我们面前。什么大学生当工人、农民“大材小用”、“得不偿失”，什么大学生到农村去是“屈才”，社会上的种种资产阶级思想都在向我们进攻。在这个尖锐的考验面前，毛主席的最新指示给了我们巨大力量。我们决心要与剥削阶级思想作最彻底决裂，要大造中国赫鲁晓夫修正主义教育路线的反，当普通工人、农民去，滚一身泥巴，沾一身油污，一辈子与工农兵结合在一起。
    方向已经指明，道路无限宽广。毕业生战友们，让我们紧跟伟大领袖毛主席，打起背包，到农村去，到边疆去，到工矿去，到基层去，当工人、农民去，永当工农兵的小学生！
