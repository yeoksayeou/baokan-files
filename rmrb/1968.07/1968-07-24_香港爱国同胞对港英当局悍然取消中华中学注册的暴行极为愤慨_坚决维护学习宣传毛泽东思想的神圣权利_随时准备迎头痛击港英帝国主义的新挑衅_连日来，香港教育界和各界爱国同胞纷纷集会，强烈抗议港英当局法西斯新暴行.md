	Hong Kong patriots are extremely indignant at the British authorities' brazen cancellation of the registration of Chinese Middle School. They resolutely defend the sacred right to study and propagate Mao Zedong Thought. They are ready at any time to strike back at the new provocations of British imperialism. In recent days, Hong Kong's educational circles and patriots from all walks of life have held meetings to strongly protest against the British authorities' new fascist atrocities.

	New China News Agency, July 22nd: Hong Kong news: On the 19th, the British authorities in Hong Kong brazenly declared that they had begun taking so-called "legal procedures" to cancel the registration of Chinese Middle School in Hong Kong. They attempted to strangle this patriotic school, which loves the motherland and enthusiastically propagates Mao Zedong Thought, and to strike at the patriotic educational cause in Hong Kong. Hong Kong patriots are extremely indignant at the British authorities' new persecution. They expressed that to defend the sacred rights of patriots to study and propagate Mao Zedong Thought and to defend the patriotic educational cause, they must resolutely counterattack the new provocations of British imperialism.

	On the morning of the 19th, the British authorities, on one hand, issued a statement through the "Information Services Department," announcing that the British had "begun legal procedures to cancel the registration of Chinese Middle School." On the other hand, the British police handed a letter to Huang Zuofen, the principal of Chinese Middle School, who was being unlawfully detained in a concentration camp by the British authorities. The letter demanded a response, which was sternly rejected by Huang Zuofen.

	Since May last year, when Hong Kong patriots launched the anti-British struggle against violence, British military and police have repeatedly launched armed attacks and looted Chinese Middle School. On November 28th, the British authorities went further, brazenly seizing the opportunity to forcibly close the school buildings of Chinese Middle School and claiming that the "closure order" for the school buildings would not be lifted until August 15, 1968. On December 2nd, the British authorities again sent agents to kidnap the principal of this school, Huang Zuofen, and have been unlawfully detaining him in a concentration camp to this day. Our Ministry of Foreign Affairs summoned the British Charge d'Affaires, Hopkinson, on December 6th last year to protest strongly to the British government against the British authorities' atrocities of forcibly closing Chinese Middle School and unlawfully arresting the principal of Chinese Middle School, Huang Zuofen. Now, the British authorities are again persecuting this patriotic school, creating incidents, and provoking the patriotic educational cause and patriots in Hong Kong.

	Over the past year and more, the patriotic teachers and students of Chinese Middle School have been fighting bravely against the British authorities' mad persecution. Despite the difficulties of having their school buildings sealed and their principal and dozens of patriotic teachers and students unlawfully detained, they have persisted in running the school and even developing it. This year, the number of new students applying to this school has been very enthusiastic, exceeding the number of original students. On the 19th, when the patriotic teachers and students learned that the British were again intensifying their persecution of their school, they were extremely indignant. They denounced the British fascist atrocities, seriously studied Chairman Mao's quotations, wrote determination letters, and expressed that they would definitely hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought to counterattack the British authorities' new provocations. On the evening of the 19th, Chinese Middle School issued a statement, strongly protesting against the British authorities. The statement said: "Hong Kong has always been sacred Chinese territory. We have the sacred and inviolable right to conduct patriotic education, to study and propagate Mao Zedong Thought on this piece of land. Anyone who infringes upon this right will definitely be met with resolute retaliation." The statement solemnly demanded that the British authorities must immediately revoke the closure order on the school buildings of Chinese Middle School; immediately abandon the conspiracy to "cancel the registration of Chinese Middle School"; immediately release the principal Huang Zuofen and other patriotic teachers and students who are still imprisoned, and guarantee their personal safety.

	In recent days, Hong Kong's educational circles and patriots from all walks of life have held meetings to strongly protest against the British authorities' new fascist atrocities. They solemnly pointed out: Since May last year, the British authorities have carried out a series of mad persecutions against our patriotic educational cause, launching armed attacks and looting our 18 patriotic schools 25 times, arresting 455 of our patriotic teachers and staff, imprisoning 172 in black jails, and still detaining 65 in prison. This old debt has not been settled, and now the British are creating new persecution incidents, which is absolutely intolerable. They follow the great leader Chairman Mao's teaching that "if any aspect of oppression is definitely to come, if it is too arrogant, if it is to oppress, then the Communist Party must adopt a serious attitude towards it," warning the British authorities: The fire is lit by the British, and the tense situation is provoked by the British. If the British authorities dare to push the situation in Hong Kong to a new tension, we are ready at any time to strike back at the British authorities' new provocations, resolutely defending our patriotic educational cause and defending the sacred rights of patriots to propagate and study Mao Zedong Thought.

	The relevant departments of our country are closely watching the development of this incident.

    香港爱国同胞对港英当局悍然取消中华中学注册的暴行极为愤慨
    坚决维护学习宣传毛泽东思想的神圣权利
    随时准备迎头痛击港英帝国主义的新挑衅
    连日来，香港教育界和各界爱国同胞纷纷集会，强烈抗议港英当局法西斯新暴行
    新华社二十二日讯　香港消息：香港英国当局十九日悍然宣称已开始采取所谓“法律手续”，取消香港中华中学的注册，妄图扼杀这所热爱祖国、热情宣传毛泽东思想的爱国学校，打击香港爱国教育事业。香港爱国同胞对港英当局新的迫害行为极为愤慨，他们表示，为了维护爱国同胞学习和宣传毛泽东思想、维护爱国教育事业的神圣权利，一定要坚决回击港英帝国主义的新挑衅。
    十九日上午，港英当局一方面通过“新闻处”发表公报，宣布港英
  “已开始进行取消中华中学注册的法律手续”，另一方面，由港英警方把一封取消这所学校的注册的信件，交给正被港英当局无理拘禁在集中营内的中华中学校长黄祖芬，并且强迫他作答复，遭到黄祖芬的严词拒绝。
    去年五月香港爱国同胞掀起反英抗暴斗争以来，港英军警曾多次武装袭击、搜劫中华中学。十一月二十八日，港英更进而制造借口，悍然强行封闭中华中学的校舍，并声称对校舍的“封闭令”要到一九六八年八月十五日才停止。十二月二日，港英当局又出动特务绑架了这所学校的校长黄祖芬，至今还把他无理拘禁在集中营内。我国外交部曾于去年十二月六日召见英国驻中国代办霍普森，就港英当局强行封闭中华中学、无理拘捕中华中学校长黄祖芬等暴行向英国政府提出了严重抗议。现在，港英当局竟又对这所爱国学校进行新的迫害，制造事端，对香港爱国教育事业和爱国同胞进行新的挑衅。
    过去一年多来，中华中学的爱国师生在港英当局疯狂的迫害面前，一直针锋相对地坚持英勇的斗争。他们在校舍被封，校长和爱国师生数十人被无理拘捕的困难条件下，坚持把学校办下来，并且有所发展。今年投考这所学校的新生十分踊跃，超过了原有学生的总数。十九日，爱国师生在获悉港英再次变本加厉地迫害他们的学校时，极为愤慨。他们纷纷痛斥港英的法西斯暴行，认真学习毛主席语录，写下了决心书，表示一定要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，回击港英当局的新挑衅。十九日晚上，中华中学发表声明，对港英当局提出最严重最强烈的抗议。声明说：“香港历来是中国的神圣领土，我们有在香港这块土地上进行爱国教育，进行学习和宣传毛泽东思想的神圣不可侵犯的权利，谁要是侵犯这个权利，谁就将受到坚决的还击。”声明严正要求港英当局必须立即撤销对中华中学校舍的封闭令；立即放弃“取消中华中学注册”的阴谋；立即释放校长黄祖芬和其他仍被投入黑狱的爱国师生，并保证他们的人身安全。
    连日来，香港教育界和各界爱国同胞纷纷集会，强烈抗议港英当局的法西斯新暴行。他们严正指出：去年五月以来，港英当局对我爱国教育事业进行了一系列的疯狂迫害，先后二十五次武装袭击、搜劫我十八所爱国学校，拘捕我爱国师生员工四百五十五人，有一百七十二人被投入黑狱，至今还有六十五人被拘禁在狱中。这笔旧债还未清算，现在港英又制造新的迫害事件，这是绝对不能容忍的。他们遵照伟大领袖毛主席
  “任何方面的横逆如果一定要来，如果欺人太甚，如果实行压迫，那末，共产党就必须用严正的态度对待之”的教导，警告港英当局：火是港英点起来的，紧张局势是港英挑起来的，如果港英当局胆敢把香港局势再度推向新的紧张，我们随时准备迎头痛击港英当局的新挑衅，坚决维护自己的爱国教育事业，维护爱国同胞宣传和学习毛泽东思想的神圣权利。
    我国有关方面正密切注视着这一事件的发展。
