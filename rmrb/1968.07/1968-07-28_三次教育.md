The revolutionary criticism and repudiation is being widely and deeply carried out in the vast rural areas of our country. It has pushed the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao Zedong's thoughts to every corner, it has thoroughly eliminated the poison of counter-revolutionary revisionism spread by Chinese Khrushchev, and it has opened up a new realm in the spiritual world of the working people. The following introduces a few small stories from the revolutionary criticism and repudiation in Lianhua Commune, Lianhua Brigade, Junan County, Shandong Province, which fully illustrate this point.

Chinese Khrushchev, in order to restore capitalism, spread a large amount of counter-revolutionary revisionist poison in the countryside. Many people were poisoned, and I was one of them. Poison must be eliminated; otherwise, one cannot follow Chairman Mao in walking the socialist path. Here, I would like to share with everyone the story of how the militiamen helped me to criticize and repudiate revisionism three times:

During the early rice transplanting season this year, one day I led a group of militiamen and commune members to pull rice seedlings. When arranging the work, I said: "Pulling one square meter of seedlings counts as one and a half work points, let's see who can pull the fastest." Before I finished speaking, militiaman Xu Shitian said: "Chairman Mao teaches us that 'political work is the lifeline of all economic work.' Chinese Khrushchev advocates the black wind of 'work points in command' and 'material incentives.' Now, when you arrange work, you do not put emphasizing proletarian politics first, but put work points first. I think you are deeply poisoned by Chinese Khrushchev!" Xu Shitian's words made me almost unable to stand. Before I could respond, the militiamen and commune members started criticizing Chinese Khrushchev's advocacy of "work points in command" and "material incentives." Some said: "We work to build socialism." Others said: "Work points in command" is a soft knife that strangles socialism. After a round of criticism, the militiamen and commune members actively started working, and the speed of pulling seedlings was nearly twice as fast as the original piecework method I proposed.

During the wheat harvest, I led a group of militiamen and commune members to thresh on the threshing floor. One day, I saw them still working during the noon rest, so I said with excitement and concern: "You don't even rest during noon, you should add three work points." I thought this was a good intention, but I didn't expect that as soon as I finished speaking, the core militiamen Xu Zhaotian and others launched a criticism at me:

"You are deeply poisoned by Chinese Khrushchev! You can't stop talking about work points. We work overtime not for the three work points, but to quickly finish the threshing floor, deliver patriotic grain to the state, and show our loyalty to Chairman Mao." A few brief words from everyone made me receive another education.

However, the counter-revolutionary revisionist poison of Chinese Khrushchev is not something that can be thoroughly eliminated with just one or two criticisms. One day, our production team held a meeting to discuss the issue of grain delivery and distribution. During the discussion, I said: "This year's harvest is really good, we can distribute a bit more and eat a bit more." Militia platoon leader Xu Changtian immediately refuted my opinion. He said, "The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us, 'When we make plans, do things, and think about problems, we must start from the fact that our country has 600 million people.' When we discuss the issue of grain distribution, we must also follow Chairman Mao's teachings. Chinese Khrushchev sings the opposite tune to Chairman Mao on the issue of grain distribution, and we must not fall for his tricks." Some militiamen said: "We poor and lower-middle peasants love socialism, walk the socialist path, and should deliver more grain to the state to support the socialist revolution and construction." Through this criticism, not only did I recognize the harm of Chinese Khrushchev's counter-revolutionary revisionist line, but it also raised everyone's awareness of the struggle between the two lines. Everyone unanimously expressed: "In distribution, we must correctly handle the relationship between the state, the collective, and the individual, deliver more grain to the state, and show our loyalty to Chairman Mao."

Through these three detoxifications, I deeply felt that the harm of the revisionist poison spread by Chinese Khrushchev must be constantly criticized to be eliminated. From then on, I studied and applied Chairman Mao's works more diligently and actively criticized and repudiated revisionism.

    三次教育
    革命的大批判正在我国广大农村广泛深入地开展，它把活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动推向各个角落，它把中国赫鲁晓夫散布的反革命修正主义毒素一一进行清除，它在劳动人民精神世界中开拓了一个新的境界。下面介绍的山东莒南县莲花公社大莲花汪大队在革命大批判中的几个小故事，充分说明了这个问题。　　　　　　　——编者
    中国赫鲁晓夫为了复辟资本主义，在农村放了大量的反革命修正主义毒气，不少人中了毒，我就是其中的一个。有毒就要消，不消就不能跟着毛主席走社会主义道路。这里向大家介绍一下民兵们三次帮我斗私批修的事：
    今年早稻插秧时，一天我带着一部分民兵和社员去拔秧苗。在安排农活时，我说：拔一平方秧苗记一分五，看谁拔得快。话音还没落，民兵徐世田便说：毛主席教导我们“政治工作是一切经济工作的生命线”，中国赫鲁晓夫大刮“工分挂帅”、“物质刺激”的黑风，你现在安排农活不把突出无产阶级政治放在首位，倒把工分放在头里，我看你中中国赫鲁晓夫的毒不浅！徐世田的一番话，说得我几乎下不了台，没等我回话，民兵和社员们便你一言他一语批开了中国赫鲁晓夫鼓吹的“工分挂帅”、“物质刺激”等黑货。有的说：我们劳动是为了建设社会主义；有的说：“工分挂帅”是扼杀社会主义的软刀子。一场大批判后，民兵和社员们积极地干起活来了，拔秧苗的速度，比原来我提的包工方法快了近一倍。
    麦收期间，我带领一部分民兵、社员打麦场。一天，我看到他们中午休息时间还干，就带着激动和关心的心情说：中午也不休息，应该加三分工。我满以为这是个好意，没料话音刚落，基干民兵徐兆田等人便向我开了炮：
  “你中中国赫鲁晓夫的毒到底多深？满口不离工分，咱加班加点不是为了三分工，而是想赶快把场打好，向国家交售爱国粮，向毛主席献忠心。”大伙简短的几句话，使我又一次受到教育。
    可是，中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义流毒并不是批判一两次就能彻底肃清的。一天，我们生产队开会研究粮食交售、分配问题。讨论中，我说：今年收成真不错，可以多分点、多吃点。民兵排长徐长田听了，立即反驳了我这个意见。他说，伟大领袖毛主席教导说，“我们作计划、办事、想问题，都要从我国有六亿人口这一点出发”。我们研究粮食分配问题，也必须遵照毛主席的教导。中国赫鲁晓夫在粮食分配问题上与毛主席大唱反调，我们决不能上他的当。有的民兵说：“我们贫下中农爱的是社会主义，走的是社会主义，就应多交售粮食给国家，支援社会主义革命和建设。”通过这次批判，不但使我认清了中国赫鲁晓夫反革命修正主义路线的危害，同时，也提高了大家两条路线斗争的觉悟。大家一致表示：在分配中一定要正确处理国家、集体、个人三者关系，多交售粮食给国家，向毛主席献忠心。
    通过这三次消毒，我深深地感到，中国赫鲁晓夫散布的修正主义的毒害，一定要经常注意批判才能肃清。从此，我更努力活学活用毛主席著作，更积极斗私批修。
