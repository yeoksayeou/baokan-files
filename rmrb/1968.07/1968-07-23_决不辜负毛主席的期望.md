	Never Disappoint Chairman Mao's Expectations
	Shanghai Machine Tool Factory Grinding Machine Research Institute Designer Wang Defa

	Our great leader Chairman Mao, in his latest directive, calls for "taking the path of Shanghai Machine Tool Factory in cultivating technical personnel from among the workers." His words struck a chord in my heart, making me feel incredibly fortunate. I shout a thousand and ten thousand times: "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live Chairman Mao forever!"

	I am the technician mentioned in the "Investigation Report" who started as an apprentice at the age of fourteen. I was born into a poor peasant family. In the old society, I only attended four years of primary school before entering the factory as an apprentice. It was our great leader Chairman Mao and the great Chinese Communist Party that liberated me from the cruel oppression and exploitation of the capitalists. It was our great leader Chairman Mao who sent me to Shanghai Machinery Manufacturing School and trained me to become a technician. Today, as I repeatedly study Chairman Mao's latest directive, I deeply feel that Chairman Mao's words truly make us workers proud!

	Cultivating technical personnel from among the workers is a path that has been hard-won and filled with fierce struggles. When I first graduated from Shanghai Machinery Manufacturing School and started working in the design department of Shanghai Machine Tool Factory, I encountered "engineers" and "experts" who did not take me seriously, and I was filled with resentment. During the Great Leap Forward in 1958, we followed Chairman Mao's teachings and went from the office to the workshop. At that time, I felt as free as a bird out of its cage. We worked with the workers on technological revolutions, broke through the shackles of rules and regulations, liberated our minds, and boldly challenged the machine tools of revisionist countries, carrying out a series of reforms. Working with the workers on technological innovations truly combined theory with practice, and the work went smoothly. However, the gang of Chinese Khrushchovs, in an attempt to restore capitalism, fiercely attacked the Great Leap Forward. Some reactionary technical "authorities" also followed their masters' orders, slandering our actions as "cutting out the appendix and also cutting out the intestines." The technical personnel had to return from the workshop to the office.

	However, the gang of Chinese Khrushchovs and the reactionary technical "authorities" in the factory thought they could stop us from following Chairman Mao's words and taking the path of integrating with the workers and peasants. This is absolutely impossible! I am originally a worker and cannot lose my worker's character. Therefore, I insisted on going to the workshop and continuing to work with the workers on technological revolutions. In May 1966, we decided to reform the "3724" flat grinding machine of the revisionist country. At that time, we advocated thorough reform; however, the reactionary technical "authorities" advocated minor reforms, saying that "minor reforms are highly beneficial." This proposal was firmly opposed by the workers. We countered with "thorough revolution." We knew that this grinding machine was copied by the revisionist country from American imperialism, a product of the 1930s. If we only made minor reforms, wouldn't we forever be crawling behind the imperialists and revisionists? But at that time, power was still in the hands of the capitalist roaders and reactionary technical "authorities," and our opinions did not receive strong support.

	Chairman Mao teaches us: "Without investigation, there is no right to speak." We conducted extensive investigations among the workers and users, seeking their opinions. The results of the investigation further strengthened our resolve to carry out thorough reforms. Thus, we proposed a redesign plan for the "3724" flat grinding machine. As soon as this design plan was proposed, it sparked a debate. The reactionary technical "authorities" could not refute us, so they obstructed us, demanding that we proceed with mass production without manufacturing a prototype. Knowing there are tigers in the mountains, we still venture into the tiger's den. The workers and young technicians participating in the design, despite various obstacles, laid out the design plan and started working. I served as the chief designer of this grinding machine, and another technician of worker origin served as the chief hydraulic designer.

	In the January Revolution storm, the revolutionary masses seized power from the capitalist roaders. The reactionary technical "authorities" who had been riding on our heads were also overthrown, and a new revolutionary committee was established. Our design and trial production work immediately received strong support from the factory revolutionary committee and the grinding machine research institute revolutionary committee, greatly encouraging our enthusiasm. Each of us was filled with the resolve to make Chairman Mao proud, working day and night. During the trial production, we worked with the workers, researching together, not distinguishing between workers and designers, all working selflessly for a common goal. On May 1st of this year, the "M7150A" large flat grinding machine we designed and trial-produced was finally born. This new type of Chinese grinding machine is completely different from the "3724" flat grinding machine. Its performance and precision far surpass the "3724" flat grinding machine. In the past, some "engineers" took two years just to copy the drawings of this revisionist country's grinding machine. Now, this grinding machine, from the planning stage to the completion of the design, took only three months. This fully proves that only by taking the path of China's own industrial development can we achieve more, faster, better, and cheaper results.

	The publication of Chairman Mao's latest directive is a great encouragement and motivation for us technical personnel of worker origin. We still have a long way to go to meet Chairman Mao's requirements. I will definitely follow Chairman Mao's words, always maintain the character of the working class, emphasize proletarian politics, never leave labor, and never leave the workers. In the new high tide of educational and industrial revolutions, I will definitely participate more actively in the current class struggle, achieve new merits and new labor for the people, and never disappoint Chairman Mao's expectations!

    决不辜负毛主席的期望
    上海机床厂磨床研究所设计员　王德法
    我们伟大领袖毛主席在最新指示中，号召“走上海机床厂从工人中培养技术人员的道路”。他老人家的话，说到了我的心里，使我感到无比幸福。我千遍万遍地高呼：“毛主席万岁！毛主席万万岁！”
    我就是“调查报告”中谈到的那个十四岁当学徒的技术员。我出身在一个贫农的家庭。在旧社会，只在小学里读了四年书，就进厂当学徒。是伟大领袖毛主席和伟大的中国共产党把我从资本家的残酷压迫和剥削下解放出来。是伟大领袖毛主席把我送进上海机器制造学校，把我培养成为技术员。今天，我反复学习毛主席的最新指示，深深感到毛主席的话，真使我们工人扬眉吐气！
    从工人中培养技术人员，这条道路走出来很不容易，充满着激烈的斗争。我刚刚从上海机器制造学校出来，到上海机床厂设计科工作的时候，接触的都是什么“工程师”、
  “专家”，他们根本不把我放在眼里，我也憋着一肚皮气。一九五八年大跃进时，我们遵照毛主席的教导，走出科室来到车间。那时候，我象鸟儿离开了笼子一样，心情非常舒畅。我们同工人一起搞技术革命，冲破了条条框框的束缚，解放思想，大胆地向修正主义国家的机床开刀，进行了一系列的改革。同工人一起搞技术革新，真正做到了理论与实际相结合，工作非常顺手。可是，中国赫鲁晓夫一伙为了复辟资本主义，疯狂地攻击大跃进，一些反动技术“权威”也秉承主子的旨意，诬蔑我们这样做是“割盲肠把肚肠也割掉了”。技术人员只好又从车间回到了办公室。
    但是，中国赫鲁晓夫一伙和厂里的反动技术“权威”，妄想阻止我们听毛主席的话，走与工农相结合的道路，这是万万办不到的！我本来就是一个工人，绝不能丢掉工人的本色。因此，我还是坚持下车间，坚持同工人一起搞技术革命。一九六六年五月，我们就决定对修正主义国家的“3724”平面磨床进行改革。当时，我们主张要改革就要彻底改革；可是，反动技术“权威”却主张小改，说什么“小改大有利”。这种主张，遭到了工人的坚决反对。我们针锋相对地提出：“彻底革命”。因为我们知道这种磨床是修正主义国家向美帝国主义抄袭来的，是美帝国主义三十年代的产品。如果我们只作小改，那不是永远跟在帝、修的后面“爬行”吗？但当时，权还是掌握在走资派和反动技术“权威”手里，我们的意见得不到有力的支持。
    毛主席教导我们：“没有调查就没有发言权”。我们就向工人和用户作了广泛的调查，向他们征求意见。调查的结果，更加坚定了我们进行彻底改革的决心。于是，我们提出了一个“3724”平面磨床的改型设计书。这个设计书一提出来，就引起了一场争论。反动技术“权威”驳不倒我们，就刁难我们，要我们不经过样机制造而直接投入成品生产。明知山有虎，偏向虎山行。我们参加设计的工人、青年技术员不顾种种阻力，摊开设计方案，就动手干起来了。我担任了这台磨床的主任设计师，另一个工人出身的技术员，担任了这台磨床的液压主任设计师。
      “一月革命”风暴中，无产阶级革命派夺了走资派的权，骑在我们头上的反动技术“权威”也被打倒在地，新生的革命委员会成立了。我们的设计试制工作，立刻得到了厂革委会和磨床研究所革委会的大力支持，大大鼓励了我们的积极性。我们每一个同志都抱着一定要为毛主席争气的雄心壮志，不分昼夜地战斗。在试制过程中，我们同工人一起劳动，一起研究，不分谁是工人，谁是设计师，大家都为一个共同的战斗目标而忘我工作。今年五月一日，我们设计、试制的“M7150A”大型平面磨床终于诞生了。这台新型中国式的磨床，同“3724”平面磨床完全不一样。它的性能和精密度大大超过了“3724”平面磨床。过去，一些“工程师”仿制这种修正主义国家的磨床时，单是抄写图纸就抄了两年。现在，这台磨床从定方案起到完成设计，只花了三个月的时间。这充分证明了，只有走中国自己发展工业的道路，才能做到多快好省。
    毛主席最新指示的发表，是对我们工人出身的技术人员极大的鼓舞和鞭策。我们离开毛主席的要求还有很大距离。我一定要听毛主席的话，永远保持工人阶级的本色，突出无产阶级政治，永远不脱离劳动，不脱离工人。在教育革命和工业革命的新高潮中，我一定要更好地投入当前的阶级斗争，为人民立新功，立新劳，决不辜负毛主席他老人家对我们的期望！
