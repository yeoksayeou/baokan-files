Shanghai Third Steel Plant's revolutionary workers, with the help of the People's Liberation Army, have created a miracle by successfully vertically moving two large chimneys. They completed in fifteen days a task that would normally take nearly two months, significantly accelerating the progress of the major overhaul of the open-hearth furnace.

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency in Shanghai on the 16th, during the major overhaul of the open-hearth furnace at Shanghai Third Steel Plant, workers managed to vertically move two chimneys, each 55 meters high and weighing 230 tons, by 31 meters and 40 meters respectively in just half a month. This task, which would originally take nearly two months, was completed in a short period, greatly speeding up the progress of the open-hearth furnace overhaul. This is a miracle created by the proletarian revolutionary cadres and revolutionary workers of Shanghai Third Steel Plant with the help of the People's Liberation Army, and a victory for the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!

Recently, Shanghai Third Steel Plant has been carrying out a major overhaul of the open-hearth furnace workshop. The relocation of the large chimneys is one of the key construction projects for the overhaul of the open-hearth furnace workshop. According to the requirement of the Shanghai Municipal Revolutionary Committee to complete the overhaul of the open-hearth furnace ahead of schedule, the two large chimneys in the open-hearth furnace workshop must be moved 31 meters and 40 meters respectively within 15 days. If the old methods were used, the chimneys would either have to be dismantled and rebuilt, or laid down and then pulled to the new foundation and erected again. Using these two methods would not only consume a large amount of manpower and resources but also require nearly two months of time.

The old methods won't work, so what should be done? The revolutionary committee of the plant, following Chairman Mao's instructions to "trust the masses, rely on the masses, and respect the masses' spirit of initiative," fully mobilized the masses and collectively discussed and devised a relocation plan. The veteran workers of the lifting section of the mechanical and electrical workshop, who were responsible for the relocation of the large chimneys of the open-hearth furnace, carefully summarized past practical experiences and boldly proposed a "vertical relocation" construction plan.

At the construction site, the workers launched a revolutionary criticism campaign. At the on-site criticism meeting, everyone repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's teaching that "the Chinese people have the spirit, have the ability, and will definitely catch up with and surpass the world's advanced level in the not-too-distant future," and put forward many constructive suggestions. Under the joint research and mutual cooperation of workers, soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, and revolutionary technicians, on July 4, they first successfully completed the vertical relocation of the No. 2 open-hearth furnace chimney, moving it 31 meters in eight hours. Subsequently, the revolutionary workers of this plant, building on their success, carried on the fighting spirit, repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's teachings, carefully summarized their experiences, and prepared for the relocation of the second chimney. On July 13, the second chimney was vertically moved 40 meters in just five hours. In this way, the relocation of the two open-hearth furnace chimneys was completed.

    上海第三钢铁厂革命职工在人民解放军帮助下创造奇迹
    成功地垂直移动两个大烟囱
    十五天完成近两月才能完成的任务，大大加快了平炉大修进程
    据新华社上海十六日电　上海第三钢铁厂平炉车间在大修平炉的时候，只用短短半个月的时间就把两个高达五十五米，重二百三十吨的大烟囱，分别垂直移动了三十一米和四十米，完成了原来需要近两个月才能完成的任务，大大加快了平炉的大修进程。这是上钢三厂的无产阶级革命派和革命职工在人民解放军的帮助下创造的奇迹，是战无不胜的毛泽东思想的胜利！
    最近，上钢三厂正在进行平炉车间的大修工程。大烟囱的移位，是平炉车间大修工程的重要施工项目之一。按照上海市革命委员会提出的要提前完成平炉大修工程的要求，平炉车间的两个大烟囱，必须在十五天内分别移动三十一米和四十米。如果采取过去的做法，要末将烟囱拆下来重建，要末将烟囱放倒后再拉到新基础上重新树好。用这两种方法，不仅要消耗极大的人力和物资，而且需要花近两个月的时间。
    老办法不行，怎么办？厂革委会遵照毛主席关于“要信任群众，依靠群众，尊重群众的首创精神”的教导，充分发动群众，群策群力研究移位方案。担任平炉大烟囱移位工作的机电车间起重工段老师傅，认真地总结了过去的实践经验，大胆果断地提出了“垂直移位”的施工方案。
    在施工现场，工人们开展了革命的大批判。在现场批判大会上，大家反复学习毛主席的“中国人民有志气，有能力，一定要在不远的将来，赶上和超过世界先进水平”的教导，提出了许多建设性意见。在工人、解放军同志和革命的技术人员共同研究、相互配合下，七月四日，他们首先胜利完成了二号平炉大烟囱垂直移位的工作，花了八个小时移动了三十一米。接着，这个厂的革命职工再接再厉，发扬连续作战的作风，反复学习毛主席的教导，认真总结经验，准备第二个烟囱的移位工作。七月十三日，第二个烟囱只花了五个小时就垂直地移动了四十米的距离。这样两个平炉大烟囱的移位工作全部完成了。
