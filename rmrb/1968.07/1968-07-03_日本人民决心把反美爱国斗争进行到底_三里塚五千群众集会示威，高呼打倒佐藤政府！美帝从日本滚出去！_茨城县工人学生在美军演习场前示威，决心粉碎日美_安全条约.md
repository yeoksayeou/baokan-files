Japanese people are determined to carry on the anti-American patriotic struggle to the end. Five thousand people gathered in Sanrizuka for a rally and demonstration, shouting "Overthrow the Sato government! U.S. imperialism, get out of Japan!"

Workers and students in Ibaraki Prefecture demonstrated in front of a U.S. military training ground, resolved to smash the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty."

According to a report by Xinhua News Agency on July 1, the East Asian News Agency reported: Farmers in Sanrizuka, Chiba Prefecture, who are fighting against the construction of the "New Tokyo International Airport" by the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries, along with about 4,000 young workers and students, held a grand rally and demonstration in Sanrizuka Park on June 30. They firmly declared that they would carry on the struggle to stop the construction of the airport to the end.

On that day, many people held long-handled sickles, bamboo spears, and clubs to participate in the rally, prepared to deal with the repression of the Sato reactionary government at any time.

The leader of the Sanrizuka farmers' movement, Tomura Kazuyoshi, said in his speech at the rally: "Our just struggle is growing in strength. The loyal running dogs of U.S. imperialism, the Sato reactionary government, send armed police to Sanrizuka every day to try to brutally suppress the farmers and workers and students who support the farmers' struggle, and continue the survey work for the construction of the airport. We will not allow such evil deeds to succeed. We must use revolutionary violence to counter revolutionary violence. We must combine our struggle with the surging anti-American patriotic struggle across the country, unite the broad masses of the people, and carry our struggle to the final victory."

Farmers' representatives, young workers, and student representatives, as well as representatives from the headquarters of the Japan-China Friendship Association (orthodox), also spoke at the rally. They all expressed their determination to support the Sanrizuka farmers' struggle. In their speeches, they also strongly demanded the abolition of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" and the dismantling of U.S. military bases in Japan.

After the rally, the participants, despite the heavy rain, marched in high spirits, waving red flags and shouting slogans. The demonstrators repeatedly shouted, "Overthrow the Sato government! U.S. imperialism, get out of Japan and Asia!"

A group of about 300 demonstrators held high a red flag with the words "Long live Mao Zedong Thought" and repeatedly shouted, "Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought! Long live the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China!"

According to a report by Xinhua News Agency on July 1, the East Asian News Agency reported: A group of students and young workers in Ibaraki Prefecture held a rally and demonstration near the U.S. Air Force training ground in Mito on June 30, demanding the dismantling of the training ground and opposing the plan of the Japanese reactionary government to build a factory to produce plutonium (nuclear fuel) near the training ground.

Members of the Ibaraki Prefecture branch of the Japan-China Friendship Association (orthodox) participated in the rally and demonstration, holding up portraits of Chairman Mao.

During the demonstration near the Mito training ground, the marchers shouted slogans such as "Dismantle the U.S. Air Force training ground" and "Smash the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty." Then, they braved the rain and held a rally in front of the Mito training ground. A representative of the young workers spoke at the rally, severely condemning the crimes of the Japanese Communist Party's revisionist group led by Kyuichi Tokuda, who have degenerated into parliamentary cretins and sabotaged the Japanese people's anti-American patriotic struggle.

The chairman of the Mito branch of the Japan-China Friendship Association (orthodox), Kawatsuki Jinoji, expressed his enthusiastic support for the students' patriotic actions at the rally and declared his determination to fight resolutely to withdraw U.S. military bases and smash the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty."

The participants at the rally passed a resolution expressing their determination to carry on the anti-American patriotic struggle to the end together with local workers and farmers.
