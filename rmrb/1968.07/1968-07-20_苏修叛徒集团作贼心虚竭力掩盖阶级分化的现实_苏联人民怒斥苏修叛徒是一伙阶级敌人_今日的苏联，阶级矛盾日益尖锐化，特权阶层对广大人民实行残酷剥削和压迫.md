The Soviet revisionist clique's crime of fully restoring capitalism in the world's first socialist country is being increasingly condemned by the Soviet people and revolutionaries worldwide. The Brezhnev-Kosygin clique, guilty and panicked, are desperately trying to justify themselves. Recently, they have been endlessly shouting about how there are "no antagonistic classes" in Soviet society, "no privileged stratum," "the fundamental interests of the people are in harmony," and "political and ideological unity" and so on.

However, lies cannot replace facts. No matter how loudly the Soviet revisionists shout, they cannot cover up their heinous crime of completely betraying the socialist cause.

The ironclad fact is that in the Soviet Union today, not only do antagonistic classes exist, but class division and class contradictions are becoming increasingly sharp. Not only does a bourgeois privileged stratum exist, but this stratum, represented by the Soviet revisionist leadership, is brutally ruling, oppressing, and exploiting the vast majority of the Soviet people. The interests and political ideologies of the Soviet people and a small privileged stratum are not only fundamentally at odds but are diametrically opposed. Their relationship is one of irreconcilable, antagonistic, life-and-death class struggle.

In today's Soviet Union, a privileged stratum that makes up only a few percent of the population controls the party and state power, imposing brutal bourgeois dictatorship on more than 90% of the broad masses of the people. They continuously purge people they do not trust nationwide, demote them, and stuff various levels of party and state organs, economic and cultural departments with a large number of bourgeois elements and revisionists, striving to strengthen the rule of the privileged stratum. They tightly control the military, making revisionist lines the "guiding principles" for the Soviet military and mobilizing the military to brutally suppress revolutionary masses rising up against revisionist rule and striking workers. They already have a massive public security force and police, but fearing the people's growing awakening and continuous resistance, they have established something called the "All-Union Republican Social Security Department," specially setting up motorized police patrols in major cities across the Soviet Union, deploying plainclothes agents nationwide, establishing a large number of fascist-style concentration camps, and intensifying the persecution of revolutionary masses. Now, in the Soviet Union, the vast majority of workers, peasants, and revolutionary intellectuals have been deprived of all political rights.

In today's Soviet Union, a small bourgeois privileged stratum uses its power and control over the means of production to replace socialist planned economy and distribution according to work with capitalist profit laws and free competition, brutally exploiting and enslaving the working people. Now, class division in Soviet society is increasingly severe, and the gap between the rich and the poor is widening. The income of privileged stratum members is tens or even hundreds of times higher than that of ordinary workers and peasants. They also use their privileged positions to extort, embezzle, speculate, and engage in corrupt practices, doing as they please. They plunder the fruits of the Soviet people's labor, living a life of extreme luxury, debauchery, and shamelessness. Meanwhile, the broad masses of workers and peasants have become hired slaves, having no political voice and living in a position of complete insecurity. The capitalist plague of oppression, exploitation, unemployment, and poverty once again hangs over the Soviet working people.

In today's Soviet Union, bourgeois scholars and revisionist writers control all cultural institutions, and demons and monsters emerge, spreading reactionary revisionist ideas, decadent bourgeois lifestyles, and ugly "Western culture." Bourgeois ideology rules the entire ideological and cultural realm, creating a chaotic mess. The socialist culture and communist moral standards nurtured by the October Revolution have been seriously destroyed. Today, Soviet workers, peasants, and revolutionary intellectuals have no freedom of speech or publication.

The Soviet people, who have personally experienced the brutal rule and oppression of the Brezhnev-Kosygin clique, are very clear about the reality of the Soviet Union today. Many Soviet workers have pointed out that the Soviet revisionist clique is the "agent of the bourgeoisie," "bourgeois philistines," and "enemy of the people." An old worker in Moscow angrily said, "Our current 'leaders' are just like the capitalists and landlords before the October Revolution." A young person said, "Today, the Soviet people seem to be living in the tsarist period." An old miner in Ukraine, denouncing the Soviet revisionist ruling clique, said, "They are not of the same class as we workers; they do not care about the sufferings of the workers at all." A worker in Irkutsk said, "The Brezhnev-Kosygin clique has betrayed Marxism-Leninism, betrayed Lenin's path, and led the Soviet Union onto the capitalist road." A worker in Uzbekistan pointed out that the current Soviet factories are "no longer socialist enterprises but capitalist enterprises." A young mechanic in Moscow pointed out that in today's Soviet Union, "the rich get richer, and the poor get poorer." A young miner in Donetsk said, "Those leaders of the Soviet revisionist clique have a good life but do not care about the lives of the workers." A combine harvester in Irkutsk said, "The Soviet revisionist clique is walking a different path from the people; the people move forward, but they drag us backward. The people want revolution, but they do not allow it."

The Soviet people's angry accusations have long exposed the shameless lies of the Soviet revisionist cliques.

The increasingly awakened Soviet revolutionary people are continuously strengthening their struggle against the dark rule of the Soviet revisionists. The Brezhnev-Kosygin clique recently reiterated the old tune of the class struggle extinction theory, which has long been bankrupt, indicating that their days are getting worse.

Our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out: "The socialist system will inevitably replace the capitalist system. This is an objective law that does not change with people's will. No matter how the reactionaries try to stop the advance of the wheel of history, revolution will inevitably occur, sooner or later, and will certainly be victorious."

The full restoration of capitalism in the Soviet Union is only a temporary episode in the history of the international communist movement. The Soviet people, with the glorious tradition of the October Revolution, will not tolerate the Soviet revisionist clique riding on their backs and acting arrogantly for long. They will surely rise up to thoroughly smash the reactionary rule of the bourgeois privileged stratum.

    苏修叛徒集团作贼心虚竭力掩盖阶级分化的现实
    苏联人民怒斥苏修叛徒是一伙阶级敌人
    今日的苏联，阶级矛盾日益尖锐化，特权阶层对广大人民实行残酷剥削和压迫
    新华社十九日讯　本社记者述评：苏修叛徒在世界上第一个社会主义国家全面复辟资本主义的罪恶行径，受到苏联和全世界革命人民越来越强烈的谴责。勃列日涅夫、柯西金集团作贼心虚，极力进行诡辩。近来他们喋喋不休地叫嚷什么苏联社会里“没有敌对的阶级”，“没有特权阶层”，“人们的根本切身利益是吻合的”，“政治和思想是一致的”等等。
    但是，谎言不能代替事实。苏修叛徒不管怎样声嘶力竭地诡辩，丝毫掩盖不了他们彻底背叛社会主义事业的滔天罪行。
    铁的事实是，苏联现在不仅存在着敌对阶级，而且阶级分化和阶级矛盾日益尖锐，不仅存在着资产阶级特权阶层，而且这个以苏修领导集团为代表的特权阶层对苏联广大人民实行着残暴的统治、压迫和剥削。苏联人民同一小撮特权阶层的切身利益和政治思想不仅根本没有什么“吻合”和“一致”，而且完全是背道而驰的，他们之间的关系是不可调和的、对抗的、你死我活的阶级斗争。
    在今天的苏联，只占全国人口百分之几的资产阶级特权阶层操纵着党政大权，对百分之九十以上的广大人民群众实行残暴的资产阶级专政。他们在全国范围内不断进行清洗，把他们不信任的人打下去，把大批资产阶级人物、修正主义分子塞进各级党政机构、经济和文化部门，极力强化特权阶层的统治。他们严密地控制着军队，把修正主义路线定为苏联军队的“行动指南”，并调动军队血腥镇压起来反对修正主义统治的革命群众，镇压罢工工人。他们本来已有庞大的公安部队和警察，但慑于人民的日益觉醒和不断反抗，又成立了什么“联盟—共和国社会治安部”，在苏联各大城市专门增设了摩托化民警部队巡逻放哨，在全国各地密布便衣特务，设立大批法西斯式的集中营，加紧对革命群众进行迫害。现在，在苏联，广大的工人、农民和革命知识分子，被剥夺了一切政治权利。
    在今天的苏联，一小撮资产阶级特权阶层分子利用他们的权势和对生产资料的支配地位，用资本主义的利润法则和自由竞争代替了社会主义的计划经济和按劳分配原则，对劳动人民实行残酷的剥削和奴役。现在，苏联社会上阶级分化日益加剧，贫富悬殊的鸿沟越来越深。特权阶层分子的收入比一般工人和农民高几十倍甚至上百倍，他们并利用特权地位敲诈勒索，贪污盗窃，投机倒把，营私舞弊，任所欲为。他们侵吞苏联人民的劳动果实，过着穷奢极欲、花天酒地、荒淫无耻的资产阶级生活。而广大的工农群众则沦为被雇佣的奴隶，不仅在政治上没有发言权，连工作和生活也处于毫无保障的地位。资本主义的瘟疫：压迫、剥削、失业和贫困，又重新笼罩着苏联劳动人民。
    在今天的苏联，资产阶级学阀和修正主义文人控制了所有的文化机关，牛鬼蛇神纷纷出笼，大肆宣扬反动的修正主义思想、腐朽的资产阶级生活方式和丑恶的“西方文化”。资产阶级的意识形态统治了整个的思想文化领域，一片乌烟瘴气。十月革命滋养起来的社会主义文化和共产主义道德风尚，遭到严重摧残。今天，苏联的工人、农民和革命知识分子，根本没有什么言论和出版自由。
    亲身经受着勃列日涅夫、柯西金集团残暴统治和压迫的苏联人民，对苏联今天的现实是非常清楚的。许多苏联劳动人民指出，苏修集团是“资产阶级的代理人”、“资产阶级的市侩”和“人民的敌人”。莫斯科一位老工人愤怒地说，“我们现在的‘领导人’同十月革命前的资本家和地主一样。”一位青年说，“今天，苏联人民好象生活在沙皇时期”。乌克兰的一位老矿工在谴责苏修统治集团时说，“他们同我们工人不是一个阶级的人，他们根本不管工人们的疾苦。”伊尔库次克一位工人说，“勃列日涅夫、柯西金集团背叛了马克思列宁主义，背叛了列宁的道路，把苏联拉上了资本主义的道路。”乌兹别克一位工人指出，目前苏联的工厂已经“不是社会主义的，而是资本主义的企业”。莫斯科的一位青年技工指出，今天在苏联“富的更富，穷的更穷”。顿涅茨克一位青年矿工说，苏修集团“那些领导人生活好了，却不管工人死活”。伊尔库次克一位联合收割机手说，苏修集团“同人民走的是两条道路，人民往前走，他们拉着后退，人民要革命，他们不准革命。”
    苏联人民这些愤怒的控诉，早就戳穿了苏修叛徒们的无耻谎言。
    日益觉醒的苏联革命人民，正在不断加强反对苏修黑暗统治的斗争。勃列日涅夫、柯西金集团近来又加紧重弹早已破产的阶级斗争熄灭论的老调，表明他们的日子是越来越不好过了。
    我们的伟大领袖毛主席指出：“社会主义制度终究要代替资本主义制度，这是一个不以人们自己的意志为转移的客观规律。不管反动派怎样企图阻止历史车轮的前进，革命或迟或早总会发生，并且将必然取得胜利。”
    苏联出现的资本主义的全面复辟，只不过是国际共产主义运动史上的一段暂时的插曲。有着十月革命光荣传统的苏联人民，绝不会长期容忍苏修叛徒集团骑在自己的脖子上作威作福，他们必将奋起彻底摧毁资产阶级特权阶层的反动统治。
