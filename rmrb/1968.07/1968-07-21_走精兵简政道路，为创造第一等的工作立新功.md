Military representatives participating in the Jiangxi Province Ganzhou Prefectural Revolutionary Committee are determined to follow the revolutionary path indicated by Chairman Mao, learn from the model workers of the old revolutionary base area of Xingguo County, and emulate the Ganzhou Prefectural Revolutionary Committee, breaking away from the old organizational framework, streamlining and reducing administration, and building the Revolutionary Committee into a revolutionary and mass-linked leadership cadre. They aim to create first-class work.

Below is an article written by military representatives participating in the Ganzhou Prefectural Revolutionary Committee.

	**Perpetually Safeguarding the Redness of the Revolutionary Power for Ten Thousand Generations**

	**Liu Yun**

	**Ganzhou Prefectural Revolutionary Committee Chairman, Military Representative**

	As early as 1942 during the Anti-Japanese War, our great leader Chairman Mao proposed streamlining and reducing administration. After the establishment of revolutionary committees at various levels during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, Chairman Mao taught us: "Revolutionary committees should implement unified leadership, break down overlapping administrative organs, streamline and reduce administration, and organize a revolutionary and mass-linked leadership cadre." Chairman Mao's latest instructions have pointed out the direction for the construction of new revolutionary committees, serving as the fundamental guarantee for consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat and preventing capitalist restoration.

	For a long time, the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in various places have used their usurped power to vigorously promote the counter-revolutionary revisionist line in the construction of political power. Many organizations have become bloated and cumbersome. The harm of such cumbersome organizations is that they easily turn into bureaucratic organs and become breeding grounds for revisionism. Following Chairman Mao's teachings, we break away from the old organizational framework, streamline and reduce administration, and reduce the number of Revolutionary Committee staff to nearly one-tenth of the original prefectural committee and prefectural bureau.

	After streamlining the organization and reducing personnel, the new revolutionary organization faces sharp contradictions with the old ideas and old styles of the exploiting classes. Some people say that there are too few personnel and they cannot cope, while others write letters or come to the door, always wanting to expand the organization and increase the number of people in their business departments. We feel that whether or not we can bravely break away from the old organizational framework and streamline and reduce administration is the fundamental difference between executing and not executing Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. This is a major issue related to consolidating and developing the Revolutionary Committee. For this reason, we organized Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams to go to the counties, cities, factories, mines, and schools under the jurisdiction of the prefecture, vigorously publicizing the great significance of Chairman Mao's "streamlining and reducing administration," mobilizing the masses to thoroughly criticize the counter-revolutionary revisionist line promoted by the Chinese Khrushchev in the construction of political power, and ensuring that the revolutionary committees at all levels in the entire prefecture firmly and unshakably follow the path of streamlining and reducing administration from the moment they are established.

	The Lingbao County Revolutionary Committee implemented the revolutionization of the leadership cadre, streamlined and reduced administration, closely linked with the masses, and established a new revolutionary style, setting a good example for us. We resolutely follow Chairman Mao's teachings, implement Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and follow the path of streamlining and reducing administration to perpetually safeguard the redness of the revolutionary power for ten thousand generations.

	**Carrying Forward the Style of Close Ties with the Masses from the Old Revolutionary Base Areas**

	**Zhao Guangrong**

	**Ganzhou Prefectural Revolutionary Committee Standing Committee Member, Military Representative**

	Chairman Mao teaches us: "The most fundamental aspect of the reform of state organs is to link with the masses." In January of this year, upon the establishment of the Ganzhou Prefectural Revolutionary Committee, we followed Chairman Mao's great teachings on "streamlining and reducing administration" and reformed the old organizations. Practice has proven that only by following the path of streamlining and reducing administration can we forever avoid detaching from the masses.

	After the establishment of the Revolutionary Committee, we participated in the "three-in-one" power organ. How do we learn and pass on Chairman Mao's great revolutionary practice of closely linking with the masses in the old revolutionary base areas? How do we bring down and pass on the excellent style of closely linking with the masses of our Party and our army? Following Chairman Mao's teachings of "everywhere we go, we blend with the local masses, not standing above them but deeply among them," we, with Chairman Mao's latest instructions, climbed mountains and crossed rivers, went deep into the grassroots, and closely linked with the masses. When we went to the mines, we wore safety helmets and went down the mine shafts; when we went to the factories, we picked up hammers and went to the workshops; when we went to the countryside, we rolled up our trousers and went to the rice fields; when we went to the schools, we put down our airs and became elementary school students. We investigated, studied, and solved problems among the masses, consciously blending with the masses in our thoughts, styles, work, and life. The masses said we were good representatives sent by Chairman Mao.

	Because we went deep into the grassroots and the masses, the other members of the Revolutionary Committee received profound education. Now, every member and revolutionary cadre of the Revolutionary Committee follows Chairman Mao's teachings, carries forward the tradition of old revolutionary base area cadres closely linking with the masses, jumps out of the administrative circle, goes deep into the grassroots, and merges with the workers and poor and lower-middle peasants. From practice, they further realized that following the path of streamlining and reducing administration requires changing the character of fear into daring, changing detachment from the masses into deep immersion among the masses, consulting with the masses more on matters, becoming students of the masses, and forever avoiding detachment from the masses.

	We deeply feel that the process of Revolutionary Committee members taking root among the masses is the process of thoroughly transforming their own thoughts and the process of learning from the masses. We are determined to forever follow the path of streamlining and reducing administration, ensuring that even if the environment changes, the style of closely linking with the masses does not change, even if the position changes, the emotional bond with the masses does not change, and even if the job changes, the attitude of being a student of the masses does not change, becoming good representatives who are revolutionary and linked with the masses.

	**Standing at the Forefront of Class Struggle**

	**Wang Xicai**

	**Ganzhou Prefectural Revolutionary Committee Standing Committee Member, Military Representative**

	We deeply understand that only by following the path of "streamlining and reducing administration" pointed out by Chairman Mao can we walk out of the office, stand at the forefront of class struggle, fully mobilize the masses, firmly grasp the initiative in class struggle, and steadily, accurately, and fiercely strike at a handful of class enemies, making the Revolutionary Committee a strong combat command center.

	Upon the establishment of the Ganzhou Prefectural Revolutionary Committee, we followed the path of streamlining and reducing administration, resolutely implemented Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, fully mobilized the masses, and launched struggles against the enemy. Where the enemy situation was most complex, we went there with Chairman Mao's latest instructions to carry out extensive propaganda. Where class struggle was most acute, we went there with red-hearted loyalty to Chairman Mao to fight side by side with the masses. In March of this year, we discovered that the class struggle cover had not been lifted in the Ganzhou Metallurgical Machinery Factory, and the revolutionary criticism was not well done. We went deep into various workshops of the factory, widely convened investigation meetings and heart-to-heart talks. Through investigation and research, we found that the main reason why the class struggle cover could not be lifted in this factory was that the masses had not been fully mobilized. Following Chairman Mao's teachings of "holding study classes is a good method, and many problems can be solved in study classes," we helped the factory Revolutionary Committee to hold extensive Mao Zedong Thought study classes, helping revolutionary masses to overcome bourgeois factionalism, further consolidating the revolutionary great alliance in thought, concentrating firepower, and directing the spearhead at a handful of class enemies, deeply launching revolutionary criticism. Through criticism, we first exposed deeply hidden counter-revolutionaries. The living facts of class struggle heightened the revolutionary masses' class struggle consciousness and awareness of the two-line struggle, further sharpened everyone's eyes, and fully mobilized the masses, making the struggle against the enemy continuously develop in depth.

	We are determined to follow the path of streamlining and reducing administration, go deep into the forefront of class struggle, better use Mao Zedong Thought to propagate to, organize, and arm the masses, and carry out the "political revolution of the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes" to the end.

    走精兵简政道路，为创造第一等的工作立新功
    参加江西省赣州专区革命委员会的军队代表，决心走毛主席指引的革命道路，学老苏区模范兴国县工作人员的榜样，象灵宝县革委会那样，跳出旧机构的圈子，精兵简政，把革委会建设成为革命化的联系群众的领导班子，为创造第一等的工作立新功。
    下面是参加赣州专区革委会的军队代表写的文章。
    永保革命政权万代红
    赣州专区革委会主任、军队代表　刘　云
    早在一九四二年抗日战争时期，我们伟大领袖毛主席就提出精兵简政。在无产阶级文化大革命中各级革命委员会联翩出现以后，毛主席又教导我们：“革命委员会要实行一元化的领导，打破重叠的行政机构，精兵简政，组织起一个革命化的联系群众的领导班子。”毛主席的最新指示，为新生的革命委员会的建设指明了方向，是巩固无产阶级专政，防止资本主义复辟的根本保证。
    长期以来，中国赫鲁晓夫及其在各地的代理人，利用他们所窃踞的权力，在政权建设方面大力推行反革命修正主义路线，许多机构臃肿、庞杂，这种庞杂机构的害处是容易变成官僚机构，成为产生修正主义的温床。我们遵照毛主席的教导，跳出原来旧机构的圈子，精兵简政，把革委会的工作人员减少到将近原地委、专署的十分之一。
    机构精简，人员减少以后，新的革命机构同剥削阶级的旧观念、旧作风存在着尖锐的矛盾，有的提出人员太少，忙不过来，有的写信或找上门来，总想把机构扩大一点，让自己所在的业务部门增加一些人。我们感到，能不能勇敢地跳出原来旧机构的圈子，精兵简政，这是执行不执行毛主席革命路线的根本区别，这是关系到巩固、发展革委会的大事。为此，我们组织毛泽东思想宣传队，下到专区所属各县、市、厂矿、学校，大力宣传毛主席“精兵简政”的伟大意义，发动群众彻底批判中国赫鲁晓夫在政权建设方面推行的反革命修正主义路线，使全专区各级革委会一成立就坚定不移地走精兵简政的道路。
    灵宝县革委会实行领导班子革命化，精兵简政，密切联系群众，建立崭新的革命作风，给我们作出了很好的榜样，我们坚决遵照毛主席的教导，执行毛主席的革命路线，走精兵简政的道路，永保革命政权万代红。
    发扬老苏区紧密联系群众的作风
    赣州专区革委会常委、军队代表　赵光荣
    毛主席教导我们：“国家机关的改革，最根本的一条，就是联系群众。”今年一月，赣州专区革命委员会一成立，就遵照毛主席“精兵简政”的伟大教导，改革了旧的机构。实践证明，只有走精兵简政的道路，才能永远不脱离群众。
    革委会成立后，我们参加了“三结合”的权力机构。怎样把毛主席当年在老苏区紧密联系群众的伟大革命实践学到手，传下去，怎样把我党我军紧密联系群众的优良作风，带下来，传下去？我们遵照毛主席“每到一地，就和那里的群众打成一片，不是高踞于群众之上，而是深入于群众之中”的教导，带着毛主席的最新指示，爬山涉水，深入基层，紧密联系群众。到矿山，我们就戴着安全帽下矿井；到工厂，我们就拿起榔头下车间；到农村，我们就卷起裤腿下稻田；到学校，我们就放下架子当小学生。我们在群众中调查问题，研究问题，解决问题，自觉地从思想上、作风上、工作上、生活上处处和群众打成一片，群众都说我们是毛主席派来的好代表。
    由于我们深入基层，深入群众，使革委会的其他成员，受到了深刻的教育。现在，革委会的每一个委员和革命干部，都遵照毛主席的教导，发扬老苏区干部紧密联系群众的传统，跳出事务圈子，深入到基层，与工人、贫下中农结合。从实践中，他们更进一步认识到，走精兵简政的道路，就必须把怕字换成敢字，把脱离群众换成深入群众，遇事多和群众商量，做群众的小学生，永远不脱离群众。
    我们深深体会到，革委会成员扎根于群众的过程，就是彻底改造自己思想的过程，就是向群众学习的过程。我们决心永远走精兵简政的道路，做到环境变，紧密联系群众的作风永不变，地位变了，与群众血肉相联的感情永不变，职务变了，甘当群众小学生的态度永不变，做一个革命化的联系群众的好代表。
    站到阶级斗争第一线
    赣州专区革委会常委、军队代表　王喜才
    我们深刻体会到，只有走毛主席指出的“精兵简政”的道路，才能走出办公室，站到阶级斗争的最前线，充分发动群众，牢牢掌握阶级斗争的主动权，稳、准、狠地打击一小撮阶级敌人，使革命委员会成为坚强的战斗指挥部。
    赣州专区革命委员会一成立，我们就走精兵简政的道路，坚决贯彻执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，充分发动群众，开展对敌斗争，那里敌情最复杂，我们就带着毛主席的最新指示，到那里深入宣传，那里阶级斗争最尖锐，我们就怀着对毛主席的赤胆忠心，到那里同群众并肩战斗。今年三月，我们发现赣州冶金机械厂阶级斗争的盖子没有揭开，革命大批判搞得不好，便深入到这个厂的各个车间，广泛召开调查会、谈心会。通过调查研究，我们发现这个厂阶级斗争的盖子揭不开的主要原因，是群众没有充分发动起来。我们遵照毛主席“办学习班，是个好办法，很多问题可以在学习班得到解决”的教导，帮助厂革委会大办毛泽东思想学习班，帮助革命群众克服资产阶级派性，从思想上进一步巩固革命的大联合，集中火力，把矛头指向一小撮阶级敌人，深入开展革命大批判。通过大批判，首先揪出了隐藏得很深的反革命分子。活的阶级斗争事实，提高了革命群众的阶级斗争观念和两条路线斗争觉悟，进一步擦亮了大家的眼睛，把群众充分发动起来了，使对敌斗争不断向纵深发展。
    我们决心走精兵简政的道路，深入到阶级斗争第一线，更好的用毛泽东思想宣传群众、组织群众、武装群众，把这场“无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命”进行到底。
