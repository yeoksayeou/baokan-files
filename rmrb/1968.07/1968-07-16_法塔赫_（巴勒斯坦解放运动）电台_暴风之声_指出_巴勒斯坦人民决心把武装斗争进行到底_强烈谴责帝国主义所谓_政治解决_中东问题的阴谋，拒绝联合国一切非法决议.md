"Fatah" (Palestine Liberation Movement) Radio "Voice of the Storm" stated that the Palestinian people are determined to continue the armed struggle to the end. They strongly condemn the imperialist's so-called "political solution" to the Middle East problem and reject all illegal resolutions of the United Nations.

New China News Agency, Cairo, July 15th - "Fatah" (Palestine Liberation Movement) Radio "Voice of the Storm" recently issued a commentary, reaffirming "Fatah" and the Palestinian people's determination to persist in the armed struggle against imperialism and Zionism until the complete liberation of occupied Palestine and the victorious return to their homeland.

The "Voice of the Storm" radio station strongly condemns the imperialist attempt to impose the so-called "political solution" to the Middle East problem on the Arab people. The radio station pointed out that the purpose of the imperialists' so-called "political solution" is to attempt to eliminate the Palestinian revolutionary movement and make Arab countries surrender.

The radio station emphasized that the Palestinian people reject all United Nations resolutions on the Palestinian issue. The radio station said: "The Palestinian people will certainly continue to adhere to their fundamental principles: not accepting any so-called peace solution, compromise solution, and other similar solutions. The Palestinian Arab people will resolutely wage a people's war for national liberation and drive Zionism and its supporters out of the occupied Arab lands."

The radio station said that the Palestinian revolution is not under the protection and control of others. The Palestinian revolution should have the independent characteristics that reflect the will and determination of the Palestinian people. The goal of the Palestinian revolution is to defeat the imperialist and Zionist rule over Palestine, not to eliminate the "consequences of Israeli aggression." "Any attempt to abandon the independent principles of the Palestinian revolution is to bring the Palestinian revolution into the orbit of those countries and parties that use the Palestinian cause for their own strategies but do not care about the Palestinian revolution."

The radio station said that after a long and arduous armed struggle, the Palestinian revolution led by "Fatah" is thriving. Now, the world no longer sees Palestinians as merely seeking some relief, deprived of their own will, and dependent on the policies of other Arab countries. Instead, the world sees the Palestinian people as heroic revolutionaries fighting for the liberation of their occupied territories. The radio station said, "Fatah's" insistence on armed struggle after the June war of resistance against the U.S.-Israeli aggression last year has boosted the confidence of the Arab people in their anti-imperialist struggle.

The radio station pointed out that "Fatah" has made a great contribution to Palestinian national unity based on the principle of resolutely waging armed struggle against imperialism and Zionism. The recent joint battles launched by "Fatah" and other Palestinian organizations have proven that the slogan of "unity of fighters on the battlefield" proposed by "Fatah" is correct. The radio station also said, "Fatah" will continue to uphold the banner of national unity and revolution, intensify the armed struggle, and strive for final victory.

    “法塔赫”（巴勒斯坦解放运动）电台“暴风之声”指出
    巴勒斯坦人民决心把武装斗争进行到底
    强烈谴责帝国主义所谓“政治解决”中东问题的阴谋，拒绝联合国一切非法决议
    新华社开罗十五日电　“法塔赫”（巴勒斯坦解放运动）电台“暴风之声”最近发表评论，重申“法塔赫”和巴勒斯坦人民决心坚持反对帝国主义和犹太复国主义的武装斗争，直到最后解放被占领的巴勒斯坦，胜利地重返自己的家园。
      “暴风之声”电台强烈谴责帝国主义企图把所谓“政治解决”中东问题的骗局强加于阿拉伯人民的阴谋。电台指出，帝国主义者提出的所谓“政治解决”的目的，是企图消灭巴勒斯坦革命运动并使阿拉伯国家投降。
    电台强调指出，巴勒斯坦人民拒绝联合国关于巴勒斯坦问题的一切决议。电台说：“巴勒斯坦人民肯定将继续坚持他们的基本原则：不接受任何所谓和平解决、折衷解决和其他类似的解决办法。巴勒斯坦阿拉伯人民将坚决地进行争取民族解放的人民战争，把犹太复国主义及其支持者从被占领的阿拉伯土地上清除出去。”
    电台说，巴勒斯坦革命不受旁人的保护和控制。巴勒斯坦革命应当有反映巴勒斯坦人民的意志和决心的独立的特点。巴勒斯坦革命的目标是打败帝国主义、犹太复国主义对巴勒斯坦的统治，而不是消除“以色列侵略的后果”。“任何想放弃巴勒斯坦革命的独立原则的企图，就是要把巴勒斯坦革命纳入那些利用巴勒斯坦事业为自己的战略服务而不关心巴勒斯坦革命的国家和政党的轨道。”
    电台说，经过长期、艰苦的武装斗争，“法塔赫”所领导的巴勒斯坦革命正在蓬勃发展。现在，世界不再把巴勒斯坦人看成只是谋求一些救济，被剥夺了自己的意志，而依附于其他阿拉伯国家政策的几百万难民。相反，世界把巴勒斯坦人民看成是为他们被占领的领土的解放而斗争的英雄的革命者。电台说，“法塔赫”在去年六月抗击美以侵略战争后所坚持的武装斗争，增强了阿拉伯人民反帝斗争的信心。
    电台指出，“法塔赫”对以同帝国主义和犹太复国主义坚决进行武装斗争的原则为基础的巴勒斯坦民族团结，作出了巨大的贡献。“法塔赫”和其他巴勒斯坦组织最近联合发动的战斗，证明“法塔赫”提出的“战士们在战场上团结起来”的口号是正确的。电台还说，“法塔赫”将继续高举民族团结和革命的旗帜，加紧进行武装斗争，直到最后胜利。（附图片）
