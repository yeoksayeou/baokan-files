	Indonesian reactionaries open the door to thieves
	Malik says “always welcome” to the U.S. “Peace Corps” returning to Indonesia for activities

	According to a report from Xinhua News Agency on the 19th, news from Jakarta: The fascist military regime's foreign minister of Indonesia, Malik, openly expressed his "welcome" to the Central Intelligence Agency's variant—the U.S. "Peace Corps"—returning to Indonesia to engage in nefarious activities on the 17th.

	According to the official mouthpiece of Indonesia, the Antara News Agency, Malik said in a statement to the press in Jakarta without any disguise, that under the fascist military regime of Suharto-Nasution, the U.S. "Peace Corps" "of course can freely carry out their activities." According to the Associated Press, Malik even more blatantly claimed that the Indonesian reactionary regime "always welcomes" the U.S. "Peace Corps" and guarantees that these spies, disguised as "peace," can "peacefully" carry out their missions in Indonesia.

	Moreover, Malik further brazenly attempted to erase the fact that the Indonesian people heroically expelled the U.S. "Peace Corps" in 1965, and servilely covered up the humiliating exit of the U.S. "Peace Corps" at that time.

    印尼反动派开门揖盗
    马利克说“永远欢迎”美帝“和平队”重返印尼活动
    据新华社十九日讯　雅加达消息：印度尼西亚法西斯军人政权的外交部长马利克，十七日公然表示“欢迎”美国中央情报局的变种——美国“和平队”重返印尼进行罪恶活动。
    据印尼官方喉舌安塔拉通讯社透露，马利克在雅加达对报界发表谈话时毫不掩饰地说，在苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯军人政权统治下的印度尼西亚，美国“和平队”“当然可以自由地进行活动”。据美联社报道，马利克更加露骨地声称，印尼反动政权“永远欢迎”美国“和平队”，并保证这些披着“和平”外衣的美国特务在印尼“太太平平地执行他们的任务”。
    不仅如此，马利克还进而明目张胆地妄图把印尼人民一九六五年英勇驱逐美国“和平队”的事实一笔勾销，而奴颜婢膝地为美国“和平队”当年被驱逐出境的狼狈相进行掩盖。
