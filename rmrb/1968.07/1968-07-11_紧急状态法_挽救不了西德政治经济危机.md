The Emergency Powers Act, which the West German parliament passed despite strong opposition from the broad masses of the West German people, came into effect on June 27. This is a serious counter-revolutionary step taken by the West German monopolist bourgeoisie to cope with the deepening political and economic crisis in West Germany.

Since the war, U.S. imperialism has been working to revive West German militarism to turn it into a tool for aggression in Europe. Under the patronage and support of U.S. imperialism, pre-war West German military-industrial giants such as the IG Farben and Krupp conglomerates quickly regained their strength. After the U.S. brought West Germany into the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in 1955 and instigated the establishment of the so-called "Bundeswehr," West German militarism became increasingly rampant, openly engaging in military buildup and war preparations, and the trend of militarization of the West German economy intensified. Currently, West Germany's military strength has reached approximately 460,000 troops, with an additional 850,000 reservists. Annual direct military expenditures alone amount to around 20 billion West German Marks, accounting for about one-third of the West German federal budget, not including expenditures for military research and the development of atomic weapons.

The revival of West German militarism has enabled the West German monopolist capitalist groups to gain high profits and significant development. For example, IG Farben's pre-war capital was 750 million Marks, but now the total capital of its three successor companies has reached over 35 billion West German Marks. With the strengthening of monopolist capital, West Germany's industrial production has risen to the second position in the capitalist world, second only to the United States.

In the revival of West German militarism, U.S. imperialism has also reaped substantial economic benefits. From 1955 to 1967, West Germany's purchases of military equipment from the U.S. alone amounted to $6 billion. At the same time, U.S. capital has flooded into West Germany. By the end of 1967, U.S. private capital investments in West Germany totaled $3.3 billion, holding significant positions in industries such as automobiles, tractors, aircraft manufacturing, electrical and mechanical equipment, chemicals, and petroleum. In West Germany's foreign trade, the most imports come from the U.S., while exports to the U.S. are generally only about half of the imports from the U.S., resulting in huge trade surpluses for the U.S.

It is for this reason that when both West Germany and the U.S. face serious economic crises, West German monopolist capital and U.S. imperialism both see the intensification of support for West German militarism and the further militarization of the West German economy as a lifeline.

The post-war economic development of West Germany was once hailed as an "economic miracle" in the capitalist world, but it could not escape the economic crises inevitably caused by capitalist production. Since the war, West Germany has experienced four economic crises, each more severe than the last, and the rate of economic growth has been declining. The industrial growth rate dropped from 20% before 1952 to 1.4% in 1966. By 1967, it had further declined by 3.2%. This unprecedented phenomenon in West German history indicates the unprecedented deterioration of the West German economy.

The latest economic crisis in West Germany began in the second half of 1966 and by the first half of 1967, industrial production had declined by 5.7%. There was a slight recovery in the second half of the year, but it still resulted in a full-year decline in production. Throughout 1967, West German industrial capacity utilization was only 77%.

By January of this year, the situation had further deteriorated. In January, industrial production fell by 12% compared to December of the previous year. Compared to December of the previous year, industrial orders decreased by 6.5%, and sales decreased by 21%; domestic wholesale trade decreased by 24.9%, and retail trade decreased by 41%. In the entire first quarter, the situation improved slightly due to increased exports to the U.S. and the UK and the government's large-scale spending. However, domestic demand remained very weak. This fully illustrates that with the development of the West German economic crisis, the broad masses of workers are becoming more impoverished, their purchasing power is shrinking, and the domestic market is further contracting, making the problem of overproduction more severe and the economic crisis more acute.

The exploitation of West German workers by West German monopolist capital has always been ruthless. In the mid-1950s, West German production had already doubled compared to the early post-war period, but workers' real wages had only just reached pre-war levels. In recent years, through the struggles of the West German working class, wages have increased. However, monopolist capital has increased labor intensity to strengthen exploitation. In addition, the West German government, in order to cope with the huge fiscal expenditures, levies heavy taxes, which take up a significant portion of workers' wages. For example, in 1965, 15.8% of West German workers' wages were taken by direct taxes, and 40% by indirect taxes. Under the heavy burden of taxes, the West German working people are becoming increasingly impoverished.

West German monopolist capital adopts measures such as reducing wages, laying off workers, and closing enterprises to shift the economic crisis onto workers, resulting in a surge in unemployment. In February 1967, the number of unemployed in West Germany reached 620,000, which decreased to over 500,000 by the end of the year, but by January of this year, it had risen to 672,000. If the more than 300,000 foreign workers who left West Germany due to unemployment are included, the actual number of unemployed in West Germany is close to one million.

The development of the West German economic crisis has intensified domestic class contradictions and deepened the political crisis in West Germany.

The broad masses of the West German people have consistently and resolutely opposed the revival of West German militarism and fascist forces and opposed the West German ruling class's policy of following the U.S. With the deepening of the West German economic crisis, the people's movement in West Germany has also been developing. Since early 1966, West German students and youth, feeling increasingly hopeless under the capitalist system, have been staging strikes and demonstrations to protest the government's educational policies and its servitude to U.S. imperialism and reactionaries around the world. The broad masses of workers have launched fierce struggles against the monopolist capital's measures to shift the crisis onto the working people, cutting wages, laying off workers, and closing mines and factories. Strikes against the capitalists' layoffs, wage cuts, and closures of mines and factories have been continuous and unending. Anti-U.S. imperialism demonstrations against the invasion of Vietnam have swept the nation.

Since the Kiesinger government came to power at the end of 1966, it has adopted a "hardline policy" to suppress the discontent and resistance of the West German people. In March 1967, the Kiesinger government passed the "Emergency Powers Act" to suppress the West German people, which was then submitted to the parliament for discussion. The West German parliament, disregarding the strong opposition from students, workers, and the laboring masses, passed this fascist law at the end of May this year, when the people's movement in West Germany was flourishing, with the support of U.S. imperialism. The magazine *U.S. News & World Report* openly admitted that the "main target" of this law is to deal with the so-called "student rebellion." To prepare for the suppression of the people, the West German government also mobilized 110,000 police in early November last year to conduct the largest-scale nationwide sweep in Germany in 37 years in West Germany and West Berlin. The West German ruling class intends to use the "Emergency Powers Act" to accelerate the further militarization and fascization of West Germany, to alleviate the political crisis, and its sinister purpose is evident.

However, the political and economic crisis in West Germany is part of the deepening political and economic crisis in the capitalist world. With the further decay of the rotten capitalist system and the further rise of the people's movements in Western Europe and North America, the West German ruling class will be increasingly trapped in a situation of internal and external difficulties. Whether it is the intensification of the revival of militarism or the implementation of the "Emergency Powers Act," it will not alleviate the increasingly acute class contradictions within West Germany but will only awaken the West German people further and make them more resolute in their struggle to overthrow the reactionary rule of the monopolist bourgeoisie.

### “紧急状态法”挽救不了西德政治经济危机

    “紧急状态法”挽救不了西德政治经济危机
    西德议会不顾广大西德人民的强烈反对而悍然通过的所谓“紧急状态法”，已在六月二十七日生效。这是西德垄断资产阶级为了应付西德日益加深的政治经济危机而采取的一个严重的反革命步骤。
    战后以来，美帝国主义为了把西德变成它侵略欧洲的工具，竭力复活西德军国主义势力。在美帝国主义的包庇和支持下，战前西德最大的军火垄断集团如法本集团、克虏伯集团等，迅速恢复了元气。一九五五年，美国把西德拉进北大西洋侵略集团以后，策动西德建立所谓“联邦国防军”，西德军国主义势力就日益猖狂，公开进行扩军备战，西德经济军事化的趋势日益加强。目前西德的兵力已经达到约四十六万人，另有预备役军人八十五万人，每年直接军费支出就达二百亿西德马克左右，占西德联邦预算支出的大约三分之一，这还不包括用于军事研究和发展原子武器的费用在内。
    西德军国主义势力的复活，使西德垄断资本集团获得高额利润，并且有了很大的发展。例如法本集团战前的资本是七亿五千万马克，而现在它的三家承继企业的总资本已经达到三十五亿多西德马克。随着垄断资本实力的增强，西德的工业生产量在资本主义世界中已经跃居第二位，仅次于美国。
    美帝国主义在西德军国主义势力复活中，经济上也捞到了很大的油水。从一九五五年到一九六七年，单是西德向美国购买军火一项，就达六十亿美元。同时，美国资本大量拥入西德。到一九六七年底，美国私人资本在西德的投资共达三十三亿美元，在汽车、拖拉机、飞机制造、电气和机械设备、化学工业、石油等工业部门都占有重要地位。在西德的对外贸易中，从美国进口最多，而向美国出口一般只有从美国进口的一半左右，使美国得到巨额的贸易盈余。
    正因为这样，所以当西德和美国都面临严重的经济危机的时候，西德垄断资本和美帝国主义都把加紧扶植西德军国主义势力，使西德经济进一步军事化，当作它们的一根救命草。
    西德战后的经济发展，曾在资本主义世界中被当作“经济奇迹”来加以吹嘘，但是它仍然逃不脱资本主义生产必然造成的经济危机。战后西德发生了四次经济危机，一次比一次严重，经济增长率越来越下降。工业增长率从一九五二年以前的百分之二十，下降到一九六六年的百分之一点四。到了一九六七年，更减产了百分之三点二。这种西德从未有过的现象，说明了西德经济状况的空前恶化。
    西德最近这次的经济危机，开始于一九六六年下半年，到一九六七年上半年，工业生产下降了百分之五点七。下半年稍有回升，但还是造成了全年的减产。在一九六七年绝大部分时间里，西德工业的开工率只达到百分之七十七。
    到了今年一月，情况继续恶化。今年一月份，工业生产率比去年十二月份又下降了百分之十二。以今年一月份同去年十二月比较，工业订货减少百分之六点五，销售减少百分之二十一；国内批发贸易减少百分之二十四点九，零售贸易减少百分之四十一。在整个第一季度，由于向美国和英国出口增加和政府的大量开支，情况才稍有好转。但是国内需求仍然十分微弱。这充分说明了随着西德经济危机的发展，广大劳动人民更加贫困，消费能力日益萎缩，国内市场进一步缩小，这就使生产过剩的问题更加严重，经济危机也更加恶化了。
    西德垄断资本对西德工人的剥削一直是很残酷的。五十年代中期，西德的生产比战后初期已经增加了一倍，但是工人的实际工资却刚刚达到战前水平。近年来，经过西德工人阶级的斗争，工资有所提高。然而，垄断资本却用增加劳动强度来加强剥削。此外，西德政府为了应付庞大的财政开支而征收的苛捐杂税，又吃掉了工人工资的很大一部分。例如一九六五年，西德职工工资被直接税征去百分之十五点八，被间接税征去达百分之四十。西德劳动人民在沉重的捐税负担下，越来越贫困。
    西德垄断资本采取削减工资、解雇工人、关闭企业等手段，把经济危机转嫁给工人，造成工人失业激增。一九六七年二月份，西德失业人数达到六十二万人，年底下降到五十多万，但是到今年一月份又跃增到六十七万二千人。如果加上因失业而离开西德的三十万以上的外国工人，西德的实际失业人数已将近一百万人。
    西德经济危机的发展，加剧了国内的阶级矛盾，加深了西德的政治危机。
    广大西德人民一贯坚决反对复活西德军国主义和法西斯势力，反对西德统治集团追随美国的政策。随着西德经济危机的加深，西德的人民运动也日益发展。从一九六六年年初起，在资本主义制度下感到越来越没有出路的西德学生和青年，纷纷举行罢课、示威，反对政府的教育政策，反对政府为美帝国主义和各国反动派效劳。广大劳动人民对于垄断资本转嫁危机、向劳动人民开刀的措施，展开了剧烈的斗争。反对资本家解雇工人、削减工资、关闭矿井和工厂的罢工运动，此伏彼起，连绵不断。反对美帝侵略越南的示威，席卷全国。
    基辛格政府自从一九六六年底上台以来，为了镇压西德人民的不满和反抗，在国内采取“强硬政策”。一九六七年三月，基辛格政府通过了镇压西德人民的“紧急状态法”，随即提交议会讨论。西德议会不顾广大学生、工人和劳动人民的强烈反对，在美帝国主义支持下，在今年五月底，正当西德人民运动蓬勃发展的时候，悍然通过了这个法西斯法案。《美国新闻与世界报道》杂志毫不掩饰地承认，这个法案的“主要目标”是对付所谓“学生叛乱”。为了给镇压人民作准备，西德政府还在去年十一月初，出动十一万名警察，在西德和西柏林进行了一次德国三十七年来最大规模的全面大搜捕。西德统治集团妄图用“紧急状态法”来加速西德的进一步军国主义化和法西斯化，缓和政治危机，其阴险目的是昭然若揭的。
    但是，西德的政治经济危机，是资本主义世界日益加深的政治经济危机的一部分。随着腐朽的资本主义制度的更加没落和西欧北美人民运动的进一步高涨，西德统治集团将更加陷于内外交困的境地。加紧复活军国主义势力也好，通过“紧急状态法”也好，都缓和不了西德国内日益激化的阶级矛盾，而只能促使西德人民进一步觉醒，更坚决地起来为推翻垄断资产阶级的反动统治而斗争。
