Chairman Mao teaches us: "Different thoughts and struggles within the party are constantly occurring. This is a reflection of class contradictions and contradictions between new and old things within the party. If there are no contradictions and ideological struggles to resolve them within the party, the party's life would stop." Our Communist Party is engaged in class struggle. Only by intensifying internal party struggles and class education can the party organization remain vigorous, thoroughly eliminate the influence of "left" and "right" opportunism, and the army have combat effectiveness, achieve victory, and continue to advance.

The process of establishing our company is one of the party branch intensifying internal party struggles and conducting extensive class education. Our company was originally a guerrilla unit of more than ten people in the mountains of Lu'nan. In the early days of establishing the company, there were countless tasks to handle. The primary task of the party branch was to seriously study Chairman Mao's works, intensify internal party struggles, start from class education, establish a strong party branch, and unite and lead all comrades in the company to complete various tasks.

In the second year of establishing the company, Liu Shaoqi threw out the poisonous weed "On Party Struggles," advocating "party peace," denying class struggle, and conspiring to usurp the party and the country to promote capitalism. We were not deceived by Liu Shaoqi's deceitful words. The party branch firmly remembered Chairman Mao's teachings, actively carried out ideological struggles within the party, conducted extensive class education, overcame and resisted various influences of bourgeois ideology, united the entire company around the party branch, and formed a strong fighting collective. We used spears and large knives to shatter the Japanese imperialists' "three alls" policy, defeated the enemy, expanded the anti-Japanese base areas, fought north and south, and moved from victory to new victories.

In the process of actively carrying out ideological struggles within the party, we continually armed our minds with Mao Zedong Thought. Those armed with Mao Zedong Thought are invincible. In 1947, our company was tasked with the main assault in the battle to liberate the heart of Central China, the key city of Henan—Xuchang. Facing a strong enemy, to fight a good battle of annihilation, we must first fight a good ideological battle and criticize the influence of the bourgeois military viewpoint. Chairman Mao teaches us, "Class struggle, once grasped, is effective." The party branch intensified internal party struggles, started from class education, and conducted extensive class education. At the class education meetings, everyone denounced the evil old society. The entire company's comrades spontaneously clenched their fists and shed tears, filled with indignation. The bitterness of class struggle illuminated the comrades' eyes. Everyone turned their sorrow into strength, wrote letters of challenge, and sent them to the party branch like snowflakes. Under the command of Chairman Mao's military line, the entire company played the role of people, like a sharp blade, directly piercing the enemy's heart. The battle began, and the comrades used clever strategies and tactics to defeat the enemy and, together with brother units, liberated Xuchang. The company was named "Xuchang Company."

During the years of war, our party branch relied on the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, intensified internal party struggles, conducted extensive class education, resisted and eliminated the influence of the bourgeois military viewpoint, rapidly grew and strengthened, and successively produced more than seventy heroes and models. The facts once again proved that without internal party struggles and class education, there would be no unified thought and action, no combat effectiveness, no victory, and no "Xuchang Company."

Our company's party branch always remembers Chairman Mao's great teachings, always pays attention to intensifying internal party struggles and class education in all matters. It was like this during the war years, and it is like this on the battle post of guarding the coastal defense. We always maintain a high degree of vigilance and never relax our vigilance against internal party class struggles just because the enemy with guns has been defeated. The party branch often guides everyone to review the company's history, making comrades deeply feel that: during the war years, we followed Chairman Mao through various historical junctures. The most fundamental thing was to rely on Mao Zedong Thought as guidance, intensify internal party struggles, and conduct good class education, this family treasure. In November 1958, Liu Shaoqi, under the pretext of "inspection," came to our company, peddling the fallacy of "party peace," attempting to disintegrate the party branch, abolish political work, and abolish internal party struggles. At that time, the soldiers did not fully understand why such a "big figure" would say so many things completely opposite to Chairman Mao's teachings. It turned out that he was using the "big figure" signboard to specially peddle his revisionist party-building line goods in the company. The facts once again educated the comrades, making everyone clear-eyed and not falling for Liu Shaoqi's tricks. The party branch led the entire company's comrades to advance along Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, follow the teachings of Vice Chairman Lin, hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, study and apply Chairman Mao's works actively, promote the "three-eighths" style, carry forward the "three democracies," and through the efforts of all comrades in the company, created a model company.

Vice Chairman Lin teaches us: "One of the greatest characteristics of our party is that party life is a struggle, not peace, not compromise. Our party wants to become a strong, progressive party with combat effectiveness, and it must conduct internal party struggles." The growth process of our company once again proved that: without internal party struggles and class education, there would be no party unity and solidarity, it would not be possible to thoroughly eliminate the influence of "left" and "right" opportunism within the party, the army would have no combat effectiveness, and it would not be possible to advance to victory.

    狠抓党内斗争和阶级
    教育解放军某部　“许昌连”党支部
    毛主席教导我们说：“党内不同思想的对立和斗争是经常发生的，这是社会的阶级矛盾和新旧事物的矛盾在党内的反映。党内如果没有矛盾和解决矛盾的思想斗争，党的生命也就停止了。”我们共产党是搞阶级斗争的。只有狠抓党内斗争和阶级教育，党组织才能朝气蓬勃，才能彻底肃清“左”右倾机会主义的影响，部队才有战斗力，才能取得胜利，才能永远前进。
    我们连队建连的过程，就是党支部狠抓党内斗争，大抓阶级教育的过程。我连原是鲁南山区一支十多个人的游击队。建连初期，工作千头万绪，党支部的头等大事，就是认真学习毛主席著作，狠抓党内斗争，从阶级教育入手，建立一个坚强的党支部，团结和带领全连同志完成各项任务。
    建连的第二年，中国赫鲁晓夫就抛出了《论党内斗争》这棵大毒草，鼓吹“党内和平”，抹煞阶级斗争，阴谋篡党、篡国，搞资本主义。我们没有被中国赫鲁晓夫那一套骗人的鬼话所迷惑。党支部牢记毛主席的教导，在党内开展积极的思想斗争，大搞阶级教育，克服和抵制了形形色色的资产阶级思想的影响，把全连团结在党支部周围，形成一个坚强的战斗整体。我们用红缨枪、大刀片，粉碎了日本帝国主义的“三光”政策，打败了敌人，扩大了抗日根据地，转战南北，从胜利走向新的胜利。
    我们在党内积极开展思想斗争的过程中，不断用毛泽东思想武装我们的头脑。用毛泽东思想武装起来的人，是不可战胜的。一九四七年，我们连在解放中原的心脏、河南重镇——许昌的战斗中担任主攻任务。在强敌面前，要打好攻坚战，必须首先打好思想仗，批判资产阶级单纯军事观点的影响。毛主席教导我们，“阶级斗争，一抓就灵。”党支部狠抓党内斗争，从阶级教育入手，大搞诉苦运动。在诉苦会上，人人都控诉了吃人的、万恶的旧社会。全连同志不约而同地握拳挥泪，义愤填膺。阶级的苦水，擦亮了同志们的眼睛。大家化悲痛为力量，求战书、挑应战书，象雪片一样送给党支部。全连在毛主席军事路线的指挥下，发挥了人的因素，象一把锋利的尖刀，直插敌人的心脏。战斗打响了，同志们用巧妙的战略战术打败了敌人，和兄弟部队一道，解放了许昌。连队被命名为“许昌连”。
    在战火纷飞的年代里，我们党支部就是靠战无不胜的毛泽东思想，狠抓党内斗争，大搞阶级教育，抵制和消除了资产阶级单纯军事观点的影响，迅速成长壮大，先后涌现了英雄模范七十多名。事实再一次证明，没有党内斗争，不抓阶级教育，就没有统一的思想、统一的行动，就没有战斗力，就不可能打胜仗，就没有“许昌连”。
    我们连党支部时刻牢记毛主席的伟大教导，时时事事注意抓好党内斗争和阶级教育。在战争年月是这样，在守卫海防的战斗岗位上，也是这样。我们始终保持着高度的警惕性，决不以为拿枪的敌人被打倒了，就松懈对党内阶级斗争的警惕。党支部经常引导大家回顾连队的历史，使同志们深深体会到：战争年代里，我们跟随毛主席闯过了各个历史关头，最根本的就是靠以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为指导，狠抓党内斗争，搞好阶级教育这个传家宝。一九五八年十一月，中国赫鲁晓夫以“视察”为名，来到我们连队，贩卖“党内和平”的谬论，妄想瓦解党支部，取消政治工作，取消党内斗争。当时，战士们还不很理解这样一个“大人物”，为什么会说出那么多和毛主席的教导完全相反的话来？原来，他就是打着
  “大人物”的招牌，专门到连队贩卖他修正主义建党路线黑货的。事实又一次教育了同志们，使大家心明眼亮，没有上中国赫鲁晓夫的当。党支部领导全连同志沿着毛主席革命路线前进，遵循林副主席的教导，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，活学活用毛主席著作，大兴三八作风，发扬三大民主，在全连同志的努力下，创造了四好连队。
    林副主席教导我们：“我们党最大的特点之一，就是党内生活是斗争的，不是和平的，不是妥协的。我们党要成为坚强的进步的党，有战斗力的党，就要进行党内斗争。”我们连队成长的过程，再一次证明了：没有党内斗争，不搞阶级教育，就没有党的团结和统一，就不可能彻底肃清党内“左”右倾机会主义影响，部队就没有战斗力，就不能胜利前进。
