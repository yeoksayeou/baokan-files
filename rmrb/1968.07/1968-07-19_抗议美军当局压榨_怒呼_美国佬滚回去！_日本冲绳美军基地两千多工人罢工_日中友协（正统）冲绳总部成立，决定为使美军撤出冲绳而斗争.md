Over 2,000 workers at U.S. military bases in Okinawa go on strike

The Okinawa branch of the Japan-China Friendship Association (orthodox) is established, vowing to fight for the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Okinawa

According to a report by Xinhua News Agency on the 17th, the East Asia Press reported that over 2,600 Japanese workers who have been subjected to brutal exploitation and oppression at U.S. military bases in Okinawa went on strike for 48 hours starting on the morning of the 16th to protest the U.S. military's decision to cut wages.

On the morning of the 16th, over 3,000 workers who labor at the U.S. military bases and supporters from other sectors gathered in front of the U.S. military service headquarters in Chibana, Nago City, and at the gates of various U.S. military bases. They set up picket lines and halted operations for the U.S. military.

The U.S. military authorities mobilized a large number of military police and even deployed helicopters to suppress the Japanese workers' struggle. The military police, ignoring the workers' protests, brutally beat the picket line members and dragged them away from the gates of the U.S. military bases. However, the patriotic Japanese workers, undeterred by the brutal suppression, shouted slogans such as "Yankees go home!" and "Let's carry on the struggle to the end!" They set up picket lines again and continued their strike.

According to a report by Xinhua News Agency on the 17th, the East Asia Press reported: The Okinawa Prefecture branch of the Japan-China Friendship Association (orthodox) held its inaugural meeting on July 13th in Naha City, the capital of Okinawa under U.S. military rule. Representatives from various sectors, including workers, farmers, students, and intellectuals from all over Okinawa, attended the meeting.

The declaration adopted at the meeting stated that the people of Okinawa Prefecture will strengthen their unity with the people of the Japanese mainland, fight against the reactionary Sato government, and strive for the immediate and unconditional recovery of Okinawa. They will also continue to advance, standing shoulder to shoulder with the people of China and Asian countries, to fight for Japan's national independence.

The meeting also adopted a plan of action. This plan of action pointed out that the most important task facing the Okinawa Prefecture branch of the Japan-China Friendship Association (orthodox) is to achieve the removal of U.S. military bases in Okinawa, the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Okinawa, and the immediate and unconditional recovery of Okinawa.

The meeting elected Ooshiro Masao as the chairman and Ooshiro Sadamitsu as the vice-chairman of the Okinawa Prefecture branch of the Japan-China Friendship Association (orthodox). (Accompanied by a photograph)

    美军当局调动了大批美军宪兵，还出动了直升飞机，镇压日本工人的斗争。美军宪兵不顾日本工人的抗议，野蛮地殴打工人纠察队员，并把他们从美军基地大门前拉出去。但是，爱国的日本工人们不畏残暴镇压，高呼“美国佬滚出去！”“让我们把斗争进行到底！”等口号。他们再次布置了纠察线，坚持罢工斗争。
