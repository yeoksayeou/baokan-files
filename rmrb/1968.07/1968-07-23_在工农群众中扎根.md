    Rooting Among the Workers and Peasants
    By Zhao Jingdang, Yao Wang Commune, Xingcheng County, Liaoning Province

    Chairman Mao has recently pointed out deeply: "Universities should still be run. I am mainly talking about technical and engineering universities, which should still be run, but the system should be shortened, education should be revolutionized, and proletarian politics should be in command. The path of Shanghai Machine Tool Factory, which cultivates technical personnel from workers, should be followed. Students should be selected from workers and peasants with practical experience, study in school for a few years, and then return to production practice." This is our battle program to carry out the proletarian education revolution to the end, and it is the fundamental strategy to cultivate and train millions of successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause. From my personal experience in the countryside, all university graduates should first go to the countryside and factories to work as peasants and workers. After a period of tempering, some can engage in technical work, and some can continue to be peasants and workers. Only in this way can we cultivate "socialist-conscious, cultured laborers."

    Chairman Mao has long taught us: "Intellectuals, if they do not combine with the workers and peasants, will accomplish nothing. The final dividing line between revolutionary and non-revolutionary or counter-revolutionary intellectuals is whether they are willing and able to combine with the workers and peasants." Chairman Mao's great and brilliant thoughts have been warmly supported by hundreds of millions of revolutionary masses and young intellectuals across the country. In 1962, I, along with many young intellectuals from colleges and universities across the country, responded to the call of the great leader Chairman Mao and embarked on the path of combining with the workers and peasants. Over the years, I have tempered and grown with the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in the great storms of the struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines. In the struggle side by side with the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, we have forged a deep proletarian friendship. When I returned to the countryside from school, they said, "You've made the right choice!" When my hands blistered, they said, "A peasant's hands are toughened by hard work." When I engaged in struggle against class enemies, they supported me, protected me, and stood up for me. When I became a cadre, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants repeatedly instructed me, "Jingdang, we trust you. You must hold the seal for us poor and lower-middle peasants." All this shows what? It fully shows that the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants love Chairman Mao the most and support Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line the most. They care for and love me, so that I can be infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, infinitely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

    In the more than six years since I returned to my hometown, I have deeply felt that as long as I follow Chairman Mao's great teachings, closely combine with the broad masses, seriously reform my non-proletarian thoughts, deeply root myself in the countryside, and establish the idea of forever farming for the revolution, I will be warmly welcomed and cared for by the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants. If I act according to the evil intentions of China's Khrushchev, go to the countryside to "gold-plate" myself, obtain peasant qualifications, and gain political capital for climbing up, I will be opposed and abandoned by the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants.

    The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants warmly welcome a large number of young intellectuals to go to the countryside to be peasants, fight side by side with them, and contribute to the construction of socialist new countryside. Let us hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, thoroughly criticize the revisionist educational line of China's Khrushchev, and better implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, walking the path of combining with workers, peasants, and soldiers!

    毛主席最近深刻地指出：“大学还是要办的，我这里主要说的是理工科大学还要办，但学制要缩短，教育要革命，要无产阶级政治挂帅，走上海机床厂从工人中培养技术人员的道路。要从有实践经验的工人农民中间选拔学生，到学校学几年以后，又回到生产实践中去。”这是我们把无产阶级教育革命进行到底的战斗纲领，是培养和造就千百万无产阶级革命事业接班人的根本大计。从我个人在农村的体会来说，所有的大学毕业生，应当首先到农村、工厂参加劳动，当农民、工人。经过一个时期的锻炼，根据实际斗争的需要，有些可以参加技术工作，有些可以继续当农民、工人。只有这样，才能培养出“有社会主义觉悟的有文化的劳动者”。
    毛主席早就教导我们说：
  “知识分子如果不和工农民众相结合，则将一事无成。革命的或不革命的或反革命的知识分子的最后的分界，看其是否愿意并且实行和工农民众相结合。”毛主席伟大的光辉思想，受到了全国亿万革命群众和知识青年的热烈拥护。一九六二年，我和全国许多高等院校的知识青年一道，响应伟大领袖毛主席的号召，走上了与工农群众相结合的道路。几年来，我和广大贫下中农一起，在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争的大风大浪里得到了锻炼和成长，并在同广大贫下中农并肩战斗中结下了深厚的无产阶级感情。当我从学校回到农村后，他们说：“你这一步走得对！”当我的手打了泡时，他们说：“农民的手就是磨出来的”。当我和阶级敌人进行针锋相对斗争的时候，他们支持我，保护我，给我撑腰。我当了干部的时候，广大贫下中农再三嘱咐我：“敬党啊！我们信得过你。你要为咱贫下中农掌好印把子。”这一切说明了什么呢？这充分说明：广大贫下中农最热爱毛主席，最拥护毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。他们关怀和爱护我，就是让我无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于毛泽东思想，无限忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。
    在我回乡的六年多的战斗历程中，自己深深地体会到，只要遵循毛主席的伟大教导去做，紧紧地和广大群众结合在一起，认真地改造自己非无产阶级思想，深深的扎根于农村，树立永远为革命种田的思想，就会受到广大贫下中农的热情欢迎和无微不至的关怀。如果按照中国赫鲁晓夫的恶毒用心行事，为了到农村去“镀金”，换取农民资格，捞取向上爬的政治资本，那就要遭到广大贫下中农的反对和抛弃。
    广大的贫下中农，热烈欢迎大批知识青年到农村当农民，同他们并肩战斗，为建设社会主义新农村而贡献力量。让我们更高地举起毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，彻底批判中国赫鲁晓夫的修正主义教育路线，更好地落实毛主席的最新指示，走同工农兵相结合的道路吧！
