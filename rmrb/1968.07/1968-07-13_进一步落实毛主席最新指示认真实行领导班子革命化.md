In many places across the country, various levels of revolutionary committees have been earnestly studying the experiences of Lingbao County and the important editorial note from the People's Daily. They are further implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions to seriously carry out the revolutionization of the leadership cadres.

The important editorial note from the People's Daily conveys the voice of the great leader Chairman Mao and the orders of the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin. Various levels of revolutionary committees have decided to take Lingbao County as an example, to firmly grasp class struggle, thoroughly criticize the counter-revolutionary revisionist line that China's Khrushchev pushed in the construction of political power, criticize conservatism, break through the resistance of the old forces of the exploiting classes, and seriously carry out the work of cleaning up the class ranks. They will streamline administration, maintain close ties with the masses, and consolidate and develop the great achievements of the Cultural Revolution in terms of organization.

The New China News Agency reported on the 12th that revolutionary committees and revolutionary cadres and masses from many places across the country have been earnestly studying the experiences of the Lingbao County Revolutionary Committee in revolutionizing the leadership cadres, streamlining administration, and maintaining close ties with the masses. They have also seriously studied the important editorial note from the People's Daily on the experiences of Lingbao County, which has greatly inspired them. They believe that the experiences of Lingbao County have powerfully demonstrated the strong vitality of revolutionary committees as a new thing and the great power of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. They have expressed their determination to follow the example of Lingbao County, to concretely implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, to revolutionize the leadership cadres, to do a good job in cleaning up the class ranks, to streamline administration, to maintain close ties with the masses, and to consolidate and develop the great achievements of the Cultural Revolution in terms of organization.

Many revolutionary committee members pointed out that the important editorial note from the People's Daily conveys the voice of the great leader Chairman Mao and the orders of the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin. We must study it repeatedly, deeply understand it, and resolutely carry it out. They immediately acted upon the editorial note and the experiences of Lingbao County, identified gaps, formulated measures, analyzed specific situations, and implemented them in action. The revolutionary committees at various levels in Henan Province were greatly inspired by the editorial note from the People's Daily and decided to make the experiences of Lingbao County bloom and bear fruit throughout the province.

The great leader Chairman Mao taught: "Revolutionary committees must implement unified leadership, break down overlapping administrative structures, streamline administration, and organize a revolutionary leadership cadre that is connected to the masses." While studying the experiences of Lingbao County and the editorial note from the People's Daily, members of revolutionary committees in various places reviewed this teaching from Chairman Mao and were once again greatly inspired and educated. Many members of revolutionary committees in Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, and other places said that the editorial note from the People's Daily deeply expounded on the great significance of streamlining administration and maintaining close ties with the masses for implementing Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, for carrying out the struggle against the enemy, for smashing the attempts of the class enemy to restore capitalism, for overcoming the old habits of bureaucratism, for promoting the great alliance of revolutionary mass organizations, and for consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat. It pointed out the key to further consolidating and developing the newly born revolutionary committees. They must study it well and implement it quickly. They resolutely declared that they would take Chairman Mao's latest instructions as their weapon, take the Lingbao County Revolutionary Committee as their example, and seriously carry out the work of cleaning up the class ranks and streamlining administration. They would also, in conjunction with these two tasks, do a good job in rectifying the party organization and strengthening party building, and further consolidate and develop the great achievements of the Cultural Revolution in terms of organization.

The revolutionary committee of Fuyuan County in Heilongjiang Province has earnestly implemented the great instructions of the great leader Chairman Mao on "streamlining administration" and "organizing a revolutionary leadership cadre that is connected to the masses," and has already achieved results. The members of this county's revolutionary committee said that streamlining administration is not just about reducing a few people; it is a major issue of following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and ensuring that the socialist iron mountain will never change color.

The members of the revolutionary committee in Liaoning Province said that whether to maintain close ties with the masses or to be detached from the masses, whether to streamline administration or to have a bloated bureaucracy, are important signs that distinguish the new revolutionary committees from the old organizations. Implementing streamlining administration is a sharp and profound class struggle. We must learn from Lingbao County, thoroughly criticize the counter-revolutionary revisionist line that China's Khrushchev pushed in the construction of political power, criticize conservatism, break through the resistance of the old forces of the exploiting classes, and resolutely take the path of streamlining administration and revolutionizing the leadership cadres to maintain close ties with the masses.

The members of the revolutionary committee of the Nanjing Port Bureau, which has done a good job in streamlining administration, earnestly studied and discussed the editorial note from the People's Daily. They linked it to the situation of reforming the administrative structure in their unit and deeply felt that Chairman Mao points out the direction for us at every critical moment. We have followed Chairman Mao's latest instructions on the construction of revolutionary committees, broken down overlapping administrative structures, implemented streamlining administration, and greatly promoted the revolutionization of our revolutionary committee's leadership cadre. We have continuously improved our style of work and maintained closer ties with the masses. Now, the members of our revolutionary committee all take pride in being an ordinary public servant of the people and shame in being an official or a lord, in showing off official airs. We take pride in going deep into the grassroots, eating, living, working, and criticizing and repudiating revisionism with the masses, and shame in the bourgeois ideology of pursuing special privileges. We take pride in humbly listening to the opinions of the masses and accepting their criticism and supervision, and shame in being high above the masses and detached from them. We must advance under the guidance of the great thought of Mao Zedong, towards "organizing a revolutionary leadership cadre that is connected to the masses."

"Without destruction, there can be no construction. Destruction means criticism, means revolution. Destruction must be based on reason, and reason is construction. Destruction comes first, and construction is within it." While studying and discussing, the members of revolutionary committees in various places reviewed this great teaching from Chairman Mao and had an even deeper understanding that to implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions on the construction of revolutionary committees, they must thoroughly criticize the counter-revolutionary revisionist line that China's Khrushchev pushed in the construction of political power, criticize conservatism, break through the resistance of the old forces of the exploiting classes. They must persistently and deeply carry out the great criticism of the revolution, and in conjunction with this, do a good job in the struggle-criticism-transformation of each unit. An old worker who participated in the revolutionary committee of the Guiyang Steel Plant said that as early as 1942, the great leader Mao Zedong proposed in the revolutionary base areas to implement "streamlining administration," which "must achieve the five goals of simplification, unification, efficiency, economy, and anti-bureaucratism." However, the counter-revolutionary revisionist line pushed by China's Khrushchev and his agents in various places made the political power structure increasingly large, the number of non-production personnel increasingly more, and many landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, rightists, and anti-revolutionaries were stuffed into the revolutionary ranks, creating a separation between the party and the masses, and a separation between the proletarian political power and the masses. Therefore, to implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions and consolidate and develop the revolutionary committees, it is necessary to thoroughly criticize the counter-revolutionary revisionist line that China's Khrushchev pushed in the construction of political power, to firmly grasp the struggle against the enemy, and to do a good job in cleaning up the class ranks. Only in this way can the proletarian revolutionary political power be ensured to never change color.

While studying and discussing, the standing committee members of the revolutionary committee in Hebei Province linked their actual work experience and said that implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions and streamlining administration is a sharp and profound class struggle. A handful of traitors, spies, and unrepentant capitalist-roaders, as well as landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, rightists, and anti-revolutionaries who have not been reformed, and the old habitual forces, will inevitably interfere with and impact the newly born revolutionary committees from various aspects. We must take a firm attitude, thoroughly criticize the counter-revolutionary revisionist organizational line pushed by China's Khrushchev, criticize the influence of old habitual forces, and severely strike down a handful of class enemies. In the class struggle, we must implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions and consolidate and develop the revolutionary committees.

The person in charge of the revolutionary committee of the East Plant of the Shandong Paper Mill said that our factory used to have more than 200 management personnel. When the factory revolutionary committee organized the management personnel to discuss the issue of streamlining the organization, due to the sabotage of a handful of class enemies and the obstruction of old habitual forces, the discussion went on and on, and the number of personnel not only could not be reduced but also needed to be increased. Later, we mobilized all the revolutionary workers in the factory to carry out a revolutionary criticism and repudiation, thoroughly criticizing China's Khrushchev and a handful of capitalist-roaders in the factory who pushed the revisionist line, and closely linking criticism with self-criticism, we swept away various ideological obstacles, and the number of management personnel was reduced. We must take the revolutionary committee of Lingbao County as our example, further carry out the revolutionary criticism and repudiation, do a good job in cleaning up the class ranks, and resolutely take the path of streamlining administration. We will organize a truly revolutionary leadership cadre that is connected to the masses and consolidate and develop the great achievements of the Cultural Revolution in terms of organization.

"Socialism, as a new thing, must go through a serious struggle with the old things before it can be realized." While studying the experiences of Lingbao County, the members of revolutionary committees in various places reviewed this teaching from Chairman Mao and had an even deeper understanding of the importance of fully carrying forward the resolute and thorough revolutionary spirit of the proletariat. The members of the revolutionary committee of the Jiangxi Paper Mill used the experiences of Lingbao County to compare with the situation in their own factory and deeply felt that to implement the revolutionization of the leadership cadres, streamline administration, and maintain close ties with the masses, they must firmly resist the resistance of the old forces of the exploiting classes and bravely jump out of the old organizational framework. Only in this way can the new revolutionary style be firmly established.

When the revolutionary committee of Lintong County in Shaanxi Province was first established, there were many people floating on the surface, many meetings, many tasks pushed, many documents issued, and much bureaucratism. Later, they followed Chairman Mao's teachings and resolutely implemented streamlining administration. The number of working personnel was greatly reduced, and work efficiency was greatly improved, which was welcomed by the masses. The members of this county's revolutionary committee deeply felt that the process of streamlining administration is a sharp and profound class struggle process. Not only must they engage in long-term and sharp struggles with a handful of class enemies, but they must also struggle against old habitual forces.

The revolutionary committee of Wuhan No. 3 Cotton Mill resolutely implemented Chairman Mao's latest instructions, mobilized the broad revolutionary masses to carry forward the thorough revolutionary spirit of the proletariat, and carried out a major reform of the entire factory's administrative structure, greatly reducing the number of non-production personnel. The members of the revolutionary committee all went deep into the workshops and teams to maintain close ties with the masses, and the revolutionary and production situation of the entire factory became better and better. After learning from the experiences of Lingbao County, the members of this factory's revolutionary committee decided to further implement the revolutionization of the leadership cadres and make the revolutionary committee continuously consolidate and develop.

After the establishment of the revolutionary committee of the Xining Food Service Company, overlapping administrative structures were broken down, and the phenomenon of too many people and too little work was eliminated. The members of this company's revolutionary committee said that in the work of streamlining administration, various obstacles will inevitably be encountered. A resolute attitude must be taken to engage in an irreconcilable struggle against the old styles, old ideas, and old forces of the exploiting classes. After seriously studying the experiences of Lingbao County and the editorial note from the People's Daily, the standing committee members of the revolutionary committee of the Lanzhou General Machinery Factory decided to eliminate all interference, break through all obstacles, further grasp the work of cleaning up the class ranks, take the path of streamlining administration, and build the revolutionary committee into a strong, agile, and closely connected to the masses, revolutionary, and strong fighting command department.

    全国许多地方各级革委会认真学习灵宝县经验和《人民日报》重要编者按
    进一步落实毛主席最新指示认真实行领导班子革命化
    《人民日报》重要编者按，传达了伟大领袖毛主席的声音，传达了以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的号令。各级革委会决心以灵宝县为榜样，狠抓阶级斗争，彻底批判中国赫鲁晓夫在政权建设方面所推行的反革命修正主义路线，批判保守主义，击破剥削阶级旧势力的抵抗，切实抓好清理阶级队伍的工作，精兵简政，密切联系群众，从组织上巩固和发展无产阶级文化大革命伟大成果
    新华社十二日讯　全国许多地方的各级革命委员会和广大革命干部、革命群众，认真学习灵宝县革命委员会实行领导班子革命化，精兵简政，密切联系群众的经验，严肃地学习《人民日报》就灵宝县的经验发表的重要编者按，受到了很大的鼓舞。他们认为，灵宝县革委会的经验，有力地显示了革命委员会这样新生事物强大的生命力，显示了毛主席无产阶级革命路线的伟大力量。他们表示，一定要象灵宝县那样，好好地、具体地落实毛主席的最新指示，实行领导班子革命化，做好清理阶级队伍的工作，精兵简政，密切联系群众，从组织上巩固和发展无产阶级文化大革命的伟大成果。
    许多地方的革命委员会成员指出，《人民日报》的重要编者按，传达了伟大领袖毛主席的声音，传达了以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的号令，我们一定要反复学习，深刻领会，坚决照办。他们闻风而动，立即学习和讨论《人民日报》编者按和灵宝县的经验，找差距，订措施，分析具体情况，落实于行动。河南省各级革命委员会，从《人民日报》的编者按中受到很大鼓舞，决心让灵宝县的经验在全省开花结果。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导说：“革命委员会要实行一元化的领导，打破重叠的行政机构，精兵简政，组织起一个革命化的联系群众的领导班子。”各地革委会成员在学习灵宝县经验和《人民日报》编者按的时候，重温毛主席这一教导，又一次受到了极大的启发和教育。北京、上海、天津等地各级革委会的许多成员们说，《人民日报》编者按深刻地阐述了精兵简政、密切联系群众，对于贯彻执行毛主席的革命路线，开展对敌斗争，粉碎阶级敌人复辟资本主义的企图，克服官僚主义旧习气，促进两派革命群众组织的革命大联合，巩固无产阶级专政的重大意义，指明了进一步巩固和发展新生的革命委员会的关键所在，必须好好学习，迅速落实。他们坚决表示，一定要以伟大领袖毛主席的最新指示为武器，以灵宝县革命委员会为榜样，切切实实地抓好清理阶级队伍、实行精兵简政两件工作，并结合这两件工作做好整顿党的组织、加强党的建设的工作，进一步从组织上巩固和发展文化大革命的伟大成果。
    黑龙江省抚远县革命委员会认真贯彻伟大领袖毛主席关于“精兵简政”和“组织起一个革命化的联系群众的领导班子”的伟大指示，已经做出了成绩。这个县革委会的成员们说，精兵简政决不仅仅是单纯减少几个人的问题，而是紧跟毛主席伟大战略部署的大问题，是保证社会主义铁打江山永不变色的大问题。
    辽宁省革委会的成员们说，联系群众还是脱离群众，精兵简政还是机构庞杂，这是新生的革委会区别于旧机构的重要标志。实行精兵简政，是一场尖锐的、深刻的阶级斗争。我们一定向灵宝县学习，彻底批判中国赫鲁晓夫在政权建设方面所推行的反革命修正主义路线，批判保守主义，击破剥削阶级旧势力的抵抗，坚决走精兵简政的道路，坚决走革命化的联系群众的道路。
    南京市实行精兵简政比较好的单位南京港务局革委会的成员们，认真学习和讨论了《人民日报》的编者按，联系本单位改革行政机构的情况，深有体会地说，毛主席在每一个关键时刻，都为我们指明前进的方向。我们遵照毛主席关于革命委员会建设的最新指示，打破重叠的行政机构，实行精兵简政，大大促进了我们革委会领导班子的革命化，不断改进作风，密切了和群众的联系。现在，我们革委会的成员，都以当一个普通的人民勤务员为荣，以做官当老爷，摆官架子为耻；以深入基层，和群众同吃、同住、同劳动、同斗私批修为荣，以搞特殊化的资产阶级思想作风为耻；以虚心倾听群众意见，接受群众批评监督为荣，以高高在上，脱离群众为耻。我们一定要在伟大的毛泽东思想指引下，朝着“组织起一个革命化的联系群众的领导班子”不断前进。
      “不破不立。破，就是批判，就是革命。破，就要讲道理，讲道理就是立，破字当头，立也就在其中了。”各地革命委员会成员在学习和讨论中重温毛主席这一伟大教导，更加深刻地认识到，要贯彻执行毛主席关于革命委员会建设的最新指示，必须彻底批判中国赫鲁晓夫在政权建设方面所推行的反革命修正主义路线，批判保守主义，击破剥削阶级旧势力的抵抗。一定要持久深入地开展革命大批判，结合搞好各单位的斗批改。贵阳钢铁厂参加革委会的一位老工人说，伟大领袖毛主席早在一九四二年就在革命根据地提出要实行“精兵简政”，“必须达到精简、统一、效能、节约和反对官僚主义五项目的”。可是，中国赫鲁晓夫及其在各地代理人推行的反革命修正主义路线，把政权机构越搞越大，脱产人员越来越多，而且还把许多地、富、反、坏、右分子塞进革命队伍，制造党和群众的分离，制造无产阶级政权和群众的分离。因此，要贯彻执行毛主席的最新指示，巩固和发展革命委员会，必须狠批中国赫鲁晓夫在政权建设方面所推行的反革命修正主义路线，狠抓对敌斗争，搞好清理阶级队伍的工作。只有这样，才能保证无产阶级革命政权永不变色。
    河北省革委会常委在学习讨论中，联系自己在实际工作中的体会说，贯彻执行毛主席的最新指示，实行精兵简政，这是一场尖锐的深刻的阶级斗争。一小撮叛徒、特务和死不悔改的走资派，没有改造好的地、富、反、坏、右分子，以及旧的习惯势力，必然要从多方面干扰和冲击新生的革命委员会。我们一定要采取坚定的态度，彻底批判中国赫鲁晓夫所推行的反革命修正主义组织路线，批判旧习惯势力的影响，狠狠打击一小撮阶级敌人，在阶级斗争中落实毛主席的最新指示，在阶级斗争中巩固和发展革命委员会。
    山东造纸总厂东厂革委会的负责人说，我们厂管理人员过去有二百多名。厂革委会组织管理人员讨论机构精简问题时，由于一小撮阶级敌人的破坏和旧的习惯势力的阻碍，讨论来讨论去，人员不但不能减少，反而需要增加。后来，我们发动全厂革命职工开展革命的大批判，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫和工厂党内一小撮走资派推行的修正主义路线，并且把批修和斗私紧密结合，扫除了各种思想障碍，管理人员才减少下来。我们一定要以灵宝县革委会为榜样，进一步开展革命的大批判，做好清理阶级队伍的工作，坚定不移地走精兵简政的道路，组织起一个真正革命化的联系群众的领导班子，从组织上巩固和发展无产阶级文化大革命的伟大成果。
      “社会主义这样一个新事物，它的出生，是要经过同旧事物的严重斗争才能实现的。”各地革命委员会成员在学习灵宝县经验的时候重温毛主席的这一教导，更加体会到了充分发扬无产阶级的坚决彻底革命精神的重要意义。江西造纸厂革委会成员，用灵宝县的经验对照了本厂的情况，深深地感到要实行领导班子革命化，精兵简政，密切联系群众，必须坚决击退剥削阶级旧势力的抵抗，勇敢地跳出原来旧机构的圈子。只有这样，新的革命化的作风才能立得牢固。
    陕西省临潼县革委会刚成立的时候，浮在上面的人多，会议多，工作推得多，文件发得多，事务主义多。后来，他们遵照毛主席的教导，坚决实行精兵简政，工作人员大大减少，工作效率大大提高，受到群众的欢迎。这个县革委会的成员深有体会地说：精兵简政的过程，是一场尖锐、深刻的阶级斗争过程。不仅要和一小撮阶级敌人进行长期的尖锐的斗争，还要和旧的习惯势力进行斗争。
    武汉国棉三厂革委会坚决贯彻毛主席的最新指示，放手发动广大革命群众发扬无产阶级的彻底革命精神，对全厂的行政机构进行大改革，使脱产人员大大减少，革委会成员都深入到车间、班组同群众保持密切联系，全厂革命和生产形势越来越好。这个厂革委会的成员学习了灵宝县的经验以后，决心进一步实现领导班子的革命化，使革委会不断巩固和发展。
    西宁市饮食服务公司革委会成立后，打破重叠的行政机构，消除了人浮于事的现象。这个公司革委会的成员说，在精兵简政的工作中，必然会遇到各种阻力。一定要采取坚决的态度，同剥削阶级的旧作风、旧观念、旧势力作不调和的斗争。兰州通用机器厂革委会常委认真学习了灵宝县的经验和《人民日报》的编者按以后，决心排除一切干扰，冲破一切阻力，进一步抓好清理阶级队伍的工作，走精兵简政的道路，把革委会建设成为一个精悍有力的、密切联系群众的、革命化的坚强战斗指挥部。
