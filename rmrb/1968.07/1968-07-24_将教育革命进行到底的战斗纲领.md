On the night of the 21st, after the revolutionary teachers and students of Beijing No. 31 Middle School listened to the great leader Chairman Mao's latest instructions on the education revolution over the radio, they were all filled with joy and excitement, spreading the news to each other. The teachers and students expressed their boundless enthusiasm: Chairman Mao's latest instructions are our battle program for carrying the proletarian education revolution through to the end. We must resolutely implement Chairman Mao's proletarian education line, follow the path of combining with workers, peasants, and soldiers as indicated by Chairman Mao, and strive for a comprehensive victory in the proletarian education revolution.

The educational field has always been an important battleground for the fierce struggle between the two classes, two lines, and two paths. Led by China's Khrushchev, a small clique of capitalist-roaders within the Party, in order to achieve their evil goal of restoring capitalism, they have long advocated "intellectual education first," opposing the political leadership of the proletariat among young students; advocated "grades first," opposing the combination of young students with the three great revolutionary practices; advocated "entrance exams first," opposing the combination of young students with workers, peasants, and soldiers. They have used every means to oppose young students serving workers and poor and lower-middle peasants, maliciously trying to lead young students down the capitalist path, attempting to turn the broad masses of young intellectuals into the successors of the bourgeoisie. We must use Chairman Mao's latest instructions as a powerful ideological weapon to thoroughly settle accounts with China's Khrushchev's heinous crimes of opposing young students going to practice.

Secondary education is a crucial link in the entire educational system, directly related to the question of nurturing the youth into successors of which class. In the past, due to China's Khrushchev's frenzied promotion of the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line, our ordinary middle schools were essentially copying the capitalist system of Europe and America and the revisionist system of the Soviet Union, turning into preparatory schools for universities, with the main task of supplying students to universities rather than cultivating socially conscious, culturally educated ordinary laborers. Under the poisonous influence of the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line, many young students regarded entering university as an honor and manual labor as a disgrace; regarded studying books as noble and going to the countryside as inferior. In the past, Beijing No. 31 Middle School was listed as a "key school" directly controlled by the old municipal and district committees because of its high entrance exam rate. Every year after the entrance exam results were announced, the old municipal and district committees' capitalist-roaders would organize city-wide rankings and comparisons. At that time, some of our school's cadres and teachers, having been deceived by China's Khrushchev, were also pleased with their "lower" rankings and anxious about their "higher" rankings. After studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions, everyone unanimously recognized: all past mistakes boiled down to one point—failing to have proletarian politics in command and failing to study Mao Zedong Thought, thus raising the wrong flag, taking the wrong path, and running the school poorly. In the future, we must strive to study Chairman Mao's works and his series of latest instructions, resolutely implement Chairman Mao's great teaching of "proletarian politics in command," take the path of political education, the path of combining with workers, peasants, and soldiers, and the path of combining education with productive labor, and cultivate the youth into reliable successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause.

Currently, our school is conducting the allocation of graduates. The allocation of graduates has always been an important aspect of the struggle between the two lines and two thoughts in the school. After two years of tempering through the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the graduates' class struggle awareness and awareness of the struggle between the two lines have significantly improved. Many people can happily accept the party and state's allocation and consciously take the path of combining with workers, peasants, and soldiers. However, some people, due to being deeply poisoned by the revisionist educational line, have various doubts and confused ideas about going to the mountains and countryside, taking the path of combining with workers, peasants, and soldiers. In response to this situation, with the help of the PLA, we have organized Mao Zedong Thought study classes, organizing graduates to seriously study Chairman Mao's series of instructions on the education revolution and his latest instructions, focusing on the class struggle and the struggle between the two lines, and deeply carrying out revolutionary criticism, making them have a deeper understanding of the serious harm of the "three heavies and three lights" (heavy on entrance exams, light on labor; heavy on cities, light on the countryside; heavy on mental labor, light on physical labor) ideology advocated by China's Khrushchev and his agents in the educational field. They all expressed: China's Khrushchev has used every means to oppose our combining with workers, peasants, and soldiers, attempting to make us detach from workers, peasants, and soldiers, detach from the revolution, detach from productive labor, and become tools for his restoration of capitalism. We must make his plot completely fail, resolutely respond to Chairman Mao's great call, go to the countryside, go to the border, go to the factories, go to the grassroots, go to where the motherland needs us the most, and walk the path of combining with workers, peasants, and soldiers for life, becoming good successors of workers and poor and lower-middle peasants. With the establishment of the revolutionary first and the honor of hardship, our school has already had hundreds of graduating students actively respond to Chairman Mao's great call, going to the front lines of industrial and agricultural production to become workers, farmers, and herdsmen. Recently, a large batch of graduates will also go to the agricultural and pastoral areas of Inner Mongolia to settle down, determined to dedicate their lives to the proletarian revolutionary cause, walking the path of combining with workers and peasants for life.

Chairman Mao's latest instructions have made us see more clearly the direction of the proletarian education revolution. We are determined to respond to Chairman Mao's great call, using the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as our guide, relying on the broad masses of revolutionary teachers, students, and staff, continuing to carry out revolutionary criticism, actively conducting teaching reforms, and contributing our efforts to the creation of a brand-new proletarian educational system.

    将教育革命进行到底的战斗纲领
    北京三十一中革命委员会
    二十一日夜里，我们北京三十一中的广大革命师生从广播中收听到伟大导师毛主席关于教育革命的最新指示以后，无不欢欣鼓舞，奔走相告。师生们无比兴奋地表示：毛主席的最新指示，是我们将无产阶级教育革命进行到底的战斗纲领。我们一定要坚决执行毛主席的无产阶级教育路线，沿着毛主席指引的同工农兵相结合的道路前进，夺取无产阶级教育革命的全面胜利。
    教育领域一直是两个阶级、两条道路和两条路线激烈搏斗的一个重要阵地。以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，为了实现他们复辟资本主义的罪恶目的，长期以来大肆鼓吹“智育第一”，反对青年学生突出无产阶级政治；鼓吹“分数第一”，反对青年学生和三大革命实践相结合；鼓吹“升学第一”，反对青年学生同工农兵群众相结合。他们千方百计地反对青年学生为工人和贫下中农服务，恶毒地要把青年学生拉向资产阶级的邪道，妄图把广大知识青年变成资产阶级的接班人。我们一定要以毛主席的最新指示为强大思想武器，彻底清算中国赫鲁晓夫反对青年学生到实践中去的滔天罪行。
    中学教育是整个教育制度中极为重要的一环，是关系到把青少年培养成哪一个阶级的接班人的重大问题。过去，由于中国赫鲁晓夫疯狂地推行反革命修正主义教育路线，我国的普通中学实际上完全是照抄了欧美资本主义和苏联修正主义的一套，办成了大学的预备学校，它的主要任务就是为大学输送学生，而不是培养有社会主义觉悟、有文化的普通劳动者。在反革命修正主义教育路线的毒害下，不少青年学生也就以升学为荣，以劳动为耻；以啃书本为贵，以下农村为贱。过去，北京三十一中就是因为升学率比较高，被旧市委和旧区委列为直接控制的“重点学校”之一。每年升学考试发榜以后，旧市委和旧区委中的走资派就组织全市性的评名次，比高低。当时我们学校的一些干部和教师，由于上了中国赫鲁晓夫的当，也为比“下”有余而沾沾自喜，为比“上”不足而不安。学习了毛主席的最新指示以后，大家一致认识到：过去千错万错，集中到一点上，就是没有用无产阶级政治挂帅，没有学好毛泽东思想，因而举错了旗，走错了路，办坏了学校。今后，我们一定要努力学习毛主席著作和毛主席的一系列最新指示，坚决执行毛主席“要无产阶级政治挂帅”的伟大教导，走政治建校的道路，走同工农兵相结合的道路，走教育和生产劳动相结合的道路，把青年学生培养成为无产阶级革命事业的可靠的接班人。
    目前，我校正在进行毕业生的分配工作。毕业生的分配工作，历来是学校中两条路线、两种思想斗争的一个重要方面。经过两年来无产阶级文化大革命的锻炼，毕业生的阶级斗争觉悟和两条路线斗争觉悟有了很大的提高，许多人都能愉快地服从党和国家的分配，自觉走同工农兵相结合的道路。但是也有一些人由于受修正主义教育路线的毒害比较深，对于上山下乡，走同工农兵相结合的道路，有种种疑虑和糊涂认识。针对这种情况，我们在解放军的帮助下，举办毛泽东思想学习班，组织毕业生认真地学习毛主席的一系列有关教育革命的教导和最新指示，狠抓阶级斗争和两条路线斗争这条纲，深入地开展革命大批判，使他们对中国赫鲁晓夫及其在教育界的代理人所鼓吹的三重三轻（重升学，轻劳动；重城市，轻农村；重脑力劳动，轻体力劳动）思想的严重危害性，有了更加深刻的认识。他们纷纷表示：中国赫鲁晓夫千方百计地反对我们同工农兵结合，妄图使我们脱离工农兵，脱离革命，脱离生产劳动，变成他复辟资本主义的工具。我们一定要使他的阴谋彻底破产，坚决响应毛主席的伟大号召，到农村去，到边疆去，到工矿去，到基层去，到祖国最需要的地方去，一辈子走同工农兵相结合的道路，做工人和贫下中农的好后代。由于树立了革命第一和以艰苦为荣的思想，我校已有数百名应届毕业生积极响应毛主席的伟大号召，到工农业生产第一线去当工人、农民、牧民。最近，还有一大批毕业生即将去内蒙古农区和牧区插队，决心把自己的毕生精力贡献给无产阶级革命事业，一辈子走同工农相结合的道路。
    毛主席的最新指示，使我们更加认清了无产阶级教育革命的方向。我们决心响应毛主席的伟大号召，在学校工作的一切领域中，以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为指针，坚决依靠广大的革命师生员工，继续开展革命大批判，积极进行教学改革，为创立崭新的无产阶级教育制度贡献一分力量。
