The allocation of jobs for graduates this time is being carried out under the excellent situation of seizing a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The Red Guards and the broad masses of revolutionary youth have undergone unprecedented tempering and testing in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and their class struggle consciousness and awareness of the struggle between the two lines have significantly increased. They are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, firmly walking the path indicated by Chairman Mao, going to the countryside, going to the border areas, going to the hardships, going to where the motherland needs them the most. The graduates of our Hepingmen Middle School have enthusiastically responded to Chairman Mao's call, with some already heading to the border areas and others preparing to depart. They proudly declare: "In our hearts, there is only the red sun, everything is dedicated to Chairman Mao. The children of China have aspirations in all directions, with one hand holding a hoe and the other a gun, forever rooted in the border areas!"

However, in the allocation of jobs for graduates, there is a sharp struggle between the two lines. For a long time, the Chinese Khrushchev has been peddling the reactionary revisionist goods of "suffering a small loss to gain a big advantage," personal struggle, fame, and family, and becoming an official and a landlord in the issue of sending educated youth to the countryside, corrupting the revolutionary will of the youth. At the same time, the old habits and thoughts of the exploiting class that have existed for thousands of years still have a deep influence. Therefore, some graduates and parents have the idea of valuing cities over the countryside, industry over agriculture, and fearing hardship and fatigue. This situation is also reflected in our Hepingmen Middle School. Some graduates, when filling out their application forms, do not start from the needs of the state but emphasize personal or family difficulties. Some want to go to factories and mines and do not want to go to the countryside; some want to go to suburban villages and do not want to go to the border areas; some want to stay in big cities. This situation shows that the allocation of jobs for graduates is first and foremost a serious political and ideological task. Only by holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, emphasizing proletarian politics, and firmly grasping the revolutionary criticism, and deeply carrying out the education of the struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines, can we ensure the smooth progress of the allocation work.

"Controlling ideological education is the central link in uniting the whole party to engage in great political struggles. If this task is not solved, the party's political tasks cannot be completed." In response to the ideological situation of some students and parents, we follow Chairman Mao's teaching that "holding study classes is a good method, and many problems can be solved in study classes," and set up Mao Zedong Thought study classes for graduates.

The study classes first organize graduates to study Chairman Mao's relevant works, so that everyone can further understand Chairman Mao's teachings on "the successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause are produced in the masses' struggle and grow in the tempering of revolutionary storms and stresses" and "the countryside is a vast world, where one can do great things." This points out the revolutionary direction for educated youth. Educated youth going to the countryside and integrating with the workers and peasants is an important way to cultivate and train the successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause and is a strategic measure to prevent and combat revisionism, consolidate, and strengthen the proletarian dictatorship. Then, starting from class education, we raise the graduates' class consciousness. The comrades from the People's Liberation Army use their own blood-stained family histories to denounce the dark rule of the old society and criticize the heinous crimes of the Chinese Khrushchev who attempts to restore capitalism. Some students recall their own bitter family histories and express their determination to never forget their roots and always be loyal to Chairman Mao, becoming faithful children of the working people. Some students criticize their exploiting class families and decide to follow Chairman Mao for a lifetime of revolution. Through the education of recalling bitterness, the class consciousness of revolutionary teachers and students has greatly improved, and their spiritual outlook has changed significantly.

We also held a parents' meeting, taking the struggle between the two lines as the guideline, to further help parents and students solve their ideological problems. Some parents, in order to educate their children to correctly face the job allocation, set up family Mao Zedong Thought study classes, through studying Chairman Mao's works and comparing the old and new societies, helping their children to fight against selfishness and criticize revisionism, and firmly believing in the path of integrating with workers and peasants, bravely going to the countryside, going to the border areas, and going to where the motherland needs them the most. Many parents also use their different personal experiences in the old and new societies to criticize the erroneous idea that going to the countryside is a hardship with no future. Before liberation, some parents were twelve or thirteen years old and worked as slaves for landlords and capitalists, with no chance to go to school; some who could go to school would be unemployed immediately after graduation. Parents say that today, Chairman Mao and the Party have shown the revolutionary path to the youth and arranged for them to go through the three great revolutionary struggles of class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experiment to temper themselves, which is the greatest care and love for the youth. We revolutionary parents should firmly support our children in walking the bright path indicated by Chairman Mao.

Through studying Chairman Mao's works extensively, setting up Mao Zedong Thought study classes, and firmly grasping class education and the education of the struggle between the two lines, the graduates have severely criticized the revisionist black goods of the Chinese Khrushchev, thoroughly smashed the bourgeois "self," and firmly established the proletarian "public." The graduates have returned their originally filled application forms and refilled them with their own wishes. Some wrote: "Father and mother are not as dear as Chairman Mao, without the Party and Chairman Mao there would be no life for me, I am determined to dedicate my precious youth to the greatest cause of humanity. Revolution to the end is my ideal, the Party's needs are my wishes, at Chairman Mao's command, I will definitely rush forward." Some wrote the heroic words of revolutionary heroes: "Human liberation is my liberation, I am willing to dedicate my life to the people, Chairman Mao instructs me to follow, Chairman Mao waves his hand and I advance!" Those who originally wrote many difficulties on the application form now write: "No matter how big the difficulties are, they are not as great as the power of the four red books in our hands." Some wrote Chairman Mao's instructions to express their determination: "With determination, fearing no sacrifice, overcoming all difficulties, striving for victory." Some parents wrote: "No difficulties at all, firmly support." Now, the job allocation work for our school's graduates has shown a great situation.

    向毕业生进行两条路线斗争教育
    北京和平门中学军训团
    这次毕业生分配工作，是在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的大好形势下进行的。红卫兵小将和广大革命青年，经受了史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命的锻炼和考验，阶级斗争观念和两条路线斗争觉悟显著提高。他们无限忠于毛主席，坚定地走毛主席指引的道路，到农村去，到边疆去，到艰苦的地方去，到祖国最需要的地方去。我们和平门中学的毕业同学，热烈响应毛主席的号召，一部分已奔赴边疆，一部分正在整装待发。他们豪迈地表示：“心中唯有红太阳，一切献给毛主席。中华儿女志在四方，一手拿锄，一手拿枪，永远扎根在边疆！”
    但是，在毕业生分配工作中，是尖锐地存在着两条路线斗争的。长期以来，中国赫鲁晓夫在知识青年上山下乡问题上，大肆贩卖“吃小亏，占大便宜”，个人奋斗，成名成家，当官做老爷等反革命修正主义货色，腐蚀青年的革命意志。同时，几千年来旧的习惯势力和剥削阶级思想，仍然有较深的影响。因此，一部分毕业生和家长有重城市轻农村、重工业轻农业和怕苦怕累的思想。这种思想在我们和平门中学也反映了出来。一部分毕业生在填志愿表时，不能从国家的需要出发，而是强调个人或者家庭困难。有的愿去厂矿，不愿上山下乡；有的愿去郊区农村，不愿到边疆去；有的要求留在大城市。这种情况说明，毕业生分配工作，首先是严肃的政治思想工作。只有高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，突出无产阶级政治，狠抓革命大批判，深入开展两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争的教育，才能保证分配工作的顺利进行。
    “掌握思想教育，是团结全党进行伟大政治斗争的中心环节。如果这个任务不解决，党的一切政治任务是不能完成的。”针对这一部分学生和家长的思想情况，我们遵照毛主席“办学习班，是个好办法，很多问题可以在学习班得到解决”的教导，办起毕业生毛泽东思想学习班。
    学习班首先组织毕业生学习毛主席有关著作，使大家进一步认识到，毛主席关于“无产阶级革命事业的接班人，是在群众斗争中产生的，是在革命大风大浪的锻炼中成长的”和“农村是一个广阔的天地，在那里是可以大有作为的”的教导，为知识青年指明了革命的方向。知识青年上山下乡与工农群众相结合，这是培养和造就无产阶级革命事业接班人的重要途径，是防修反修、巩固和加强无产阶级专政的战略措施。然后，从阶级教育入手，提高毕业生的阶级觉悟。解放军同志用自己血泪斑斑的家史，控诉了旧社会的黑暗统治，批判了中国赫鲁晓夫妄想复辟资本主义的滔天罪行。有的同学回忆了自己的苦难家史，表示要永远不忘本，永远忠于毛主席，做劳动人民的忠实儿女。有的同学批判了自己的剥削阶级家庭，决心跟着毛主席干一辈子革命。通过忆苦教育，革命师生的阶级觉悟大大提高，精神面貌起了很大的变化。
    我们又召开了家长会，以两条路线斗争为纲，进一步帮助家长和同学解决思想问题。有的家长为了教育子女正确对待毕业分配，办起了家庭毛泽东思想学习班，通过学习毛主席著作、新旧社会对比，帮助儿女斗私批修，坚定了走与工农相结合道路的信心，勇敢地到农村去，到边疆去，到祖国最需要的地方去。许多家长还用自己在新旧社会中不同的亲身经历，批判了认为上山下乡受苦受累没有前途的错误思想。解放前，有的家长十二三岁就给地主、资本家当牛做马，那有机会上学；有的即使能上学，但那时毕业即是失业。家长们说，今天毛主席和党给青年指明了革命道路，安排好了到阶级斗争、生产斗争和科学实验三大革命斗争中去锻炼的良好机会，这是对青年最大的关怀和爱护。我们革命的家长应该坚决支持孩子们走毛主席指引的光明大道。
    由于大学毛主席著作，大办毛泽东思想学习班，紧紧抓住阶级教育和两条路线斗争的教育，毕业生们狠批了中国赫鲁晓夫的修正主义黑货，大破了资产阶级的“私”字，大立了无产阶级的“公”字。毕业生纷纷把原来填的志愿表要回去，重新填上了自己的志愿。有的写上：“爹亲娘亲不如毛主席亲，没有党和毛主席就没有我的一生，我决心将宝贵的青春献给人类最伟大的事业。革命到底就是我的理想，党的需要就是我的志愿，毛主席一声令下，我坚决奔向前。”有的写上了革命英雄的豪言壮语：“人类解放我解放，我愿一生为人民，毛主席指示我照办，毛主席挥手我前进！”原来在志愿表上填了很多困难的，现在写上：“困难再大，没有我们手中的四卷红书威力大。”有的写上了毛主席的指示，来表示自己的决心：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”有的家长写上“毫无困难，坚决支持。”现在，我校的毕业生分配工作出现了大好形势。
