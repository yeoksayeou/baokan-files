The massive strike launched by the French working class in mid-May has not only deepened the political crisis of the French ruling class but also dealt a heavy blow to the already precarious French economy, leaving the country facing a series of severe challenges, including declining production, soaring unemployment, skyrocketing prices, rapidly depleting gold and foreign exchange reserves, and a precarious position for the franc.

During this powerful strike, over ten million workers occupied more than half of France's factories, mines, and enterprises, including those tightly controlled by the French government in the nuclear industry. Over the course of more than a month, France's industrial production came to a halt, transportation was disrupted, and the national economy was paralyzed. Although the intense strike has temporarily subsided, the severe impact on the French capitalist economy is becoming increasingly apparent.

According to estimates from Western newspapers and news agencies, the French workers' strike will reduce France's industrial output by at least 6% this year. French Prime Minister Georges Pompidou admitted that the general strike cost French monopolies 30 billion francs. Additionally, due to the strike causing delays in deliveries, France's exports have decreased by at least one-third, directly affecting France's foreign exchange earnings and worsening its international balance of payments. France's gold and foreign exchange reserves, which have been painstakingly accumulated over many years, are now rapidly and significantly depleting. According to the Bank of France, since the strike began, France has lost gold and foreign exchange reserves totaling $1.734 billion, which is more than a quarter of its total reserves.

All of this has severely undermined the position of the franc, pushing it from a relatively stable position in the capitalist world to a precarious state. The precarious situation of the franc is not only a blow to the French ruling class, which has always considered the strength of the franc as a crucial asset in its struggle for hegemony in the Western world with the United States, but also a significant threat to other capitalist countries. If the franc devalues, it will inevitably trigger a chain reaction in the entire Western world, further weakening the already shaky positions of the dollar and the pound, and accelerating the collapse of the entire Western monetary system.

In light of this situation, the French ruling class is sparing no effort to maintain the position of the franc. After announcing measures to control foreign exchange, the French government decided on July 3 to raise the discount rate of the Bank of France from 3.5% to 5%, attempting to attract capital and reduce the trade deficit, thereby preventing further large-scale outflows of gold and foreign exchange reserves and maintaining the franc's credibility abroad. For the same purpose, the French government recently announced subsidies for exports and restrictions on imports to increase foreign exchange earnings and improve the balance of payments. However, in reality, all these measures are akin to "drinking poison to quench thirst" and will inevitably have severe side effects. Even the French official news agency Agence France-Presse admits that raising the discount rate and tightening credit will affect corporate investments and "damage" economic development. On the other hand, France's government, using administrative measures to strengthen exports and shift the crisis to other capitalist countries, has already provoked strong dissatisfaction from France's main trading partners in the European Common Market and the United States. This further intensifies the trade war among capitalist countries over market share.

Meanwhile, the French monopolistic bourgeoisie is ruthlessly attacking the French people, shifting the burden onto the working class. The French government has already announced new taxes amounting to approximately 2.5 billion francs. French capitalists are raising prices for goods. According to Western news agencies, so far, prices for bread, milk, gasoline, taxi fares, and new cars have increased by 3% to 5%, and many capitalists are considering "significant price increases." Additionally, to strengthen their competitive position abroad and seize greater profits, monopolistic capital is accelerating corporate mergers, increasing the intensity of labor, and throwing large numbers of workers into the already enormous ranks of the unemployed.

The French ruling class's efforts to maintain the interests of the monopolistic bourgeoisie by intensifying the exploitation and oppression of the working people will not only fail to rescue the ailing French capitalist economy but will instead further exacerbate class contradictions within France, accelerate the political awakening of the French working people, and prompt them to launch more powerful struggles to completely overthrow the reactionary rule of the French monopolistic bourgeoisie.

    生产下降  出口猛减  物价飞涨  黄金外汇储备锐减  法郎不稳
    法国工人大罢工沉重打击资本主义经济
    据新华社八日讯法国工人阶级五月中旬掀起的汹涌澎湃的大罢工，不但加深了法国统治集团的政治危机，而且沉重地打击了本来就已经险象环生的法国财政经济，使法国面临着生产下降、失业猛增、物价陡涨、黄金外汇储备锐减、法郎地位岌岌可危等一系列严重困难。
    在这次声势浩大的罢工斗争中，一千多万罢工工人曾经占领了法国半数以上的工厂、矿山和企业，连法国政府紧紧控制下的原子工业也未能逃脱。在前后一个多月的时间内，法国的工业生产停顿，交通运输断绝，全国经济生活陷于瘫痪。现在，轰轰烈烈的罢工斗争虽然暂时转入了低潮，但是这场罢工斗争给予法国资本主义经济的沉重打击所造成的后果正在日益显露出来。
    据西方报纸和通讯社估计，法国工人的大罢工至少将使今年法国工业的产值减少百分之六；法国总理蓬皮杜承认，总罢工使法国垄断资本丧失了三百亿法郎。另外，由于大罢工引起的不能如期交货，至少使法国的出口贸易减少了三分之一；这样，直接影响了法国的外汇收入而使它的国际收支状况急遽恶化，法国多年来竭尽全力积累起来的黄金外汇储备正在不断迅速大量流失。据法兰西银行透露，大罢工以来，法国总共已流失总值十七亿三千四百万美元的黄金外汇，相当于它全部黄金外汇储备总和的四分之一以上。
    所有这一切，都沉重地打击了法国法郎的地位，使原来在资本主义世界相对来说比较稳定的法郎，陷入了摇摇欲坠的困境。法郎处境的危急，不仅对于一向把法郎的“实力地位”看作是同美国争夺西方世界霸权的重要资本的法国统治集团是当头一棒，就是对于其他资本主义国家来说，也是一个莫大的威胁。如果法郎一旦贬值，势必在整个西方世界引起连锁反应，使早就处在风雨飘摇中的美元和英镑的地位不可避免地要受到致命打击，同时整个西方世界货币体系也将加速走向崩溃。
    基于这种情况，法国统治集团正在不惜倾其全力企图保住法郎的地位。法国政府在宣布采取外汇管制措施之后，本月三日又决定把法兰西银行的贴现率从原来的百分之三点五猛提到百分之五，企图用这种办法来吸引游资、减少国际收支逆差，阻止黄金外汇储备继续大量外流，以便维持法郎在国外的“信用”。也是出于同样目的，法国政府不久前宣布要补助出口和限制进口，以增加外汇收入，改善国际收支状况。但是，实际上，所有这些措施都无异于“饮鸩止渴”，不可避免地将会引起极其严重的副作用。连法国官方的法新社也不得不承认，提高贴现率紧缩银根的措施将影响企业的投资，“损害”经济的发展。另一方面，法国政府以邻为壑，用行政手段来加强出口，向别的资本主义国家转嫁危机的做法，已经引起了法国的主要贸易对手西欧共同市场其他五国以及美国等强烈不满。这进一步加剧了资本主义世界争夺市场的贸易战。
    与此同时，法国垄断资产阶级正在凶恶地向法国人民开刀，把困难转嫁给劳动人民。法国政府已经宣布，要加征新税收约二十五亿法郎。法国的资本家正在纷纷宣布提高商品价格。据西方通讯社报道，迄今为止，面包、牛奶、汽油、出租汽车费用等已经涨价，新汽车的价格也提高了百分之三到五，而许多资本家还正在考虑“大提价或大大提价”。此外，为了加强在国外的竞争地位和攫取更大的利润，垄断资本正在拚命加速企业的合并，加强工人的劳动强度，把大批工人抛入本来已经十分庞大的失业队伍。
    法国统治集团为了维护垄断资产阶级利益而加紧剥削、压榨劳动人民的倒行逆施，不仅挽救不了百孔千疮的法国资本主义经济，相反地，只能使法国国内阶级矛盾进一步激化，加速法国劳动人民在政治上的进一步觉醒，促使他们掀起更强有力的斗争风暴，来彻底推翻法国垄断资产阶级的反动统治。
