The military and civilians in Quang Ngai, Thua Thien, and Quang Tin provinces in South Vietnam bravely counterattacked the enemy's "sweeping" operations in late June and the first half of July, annihilating over 2,000 U.S. and puppet troops.

The report said that from June 20 to 30, two battalions of U.S. aggressor troops and four battalions of puppet troops, under the cover of armored vehicles, launched "sweeping" operations in several communes in the western part of Thuy Yen and Nghia Hanh counties in Quang Ngai Province, attempting to relieve the besieged Quang Ngai City. The people's liberation armed forces in Quang Ngai Province, displaying initiative and continuous attack spirit, not only counterattacked the enemy's "sweeping" operations but also raided enemy strongholds in the city and suburbs of Quang Ngai, annihilating and wounding over 770 enemy troops, including 200 U.S. aggressor troops.

The report said that in Thua Thien Province, the enemy, to counter the attacks of the people's liberation armed forces, has since June mobilized about five battalions of troops to the mountains of Phong Dien County for "sweeping" operations. Local military and civilians have since the first day of the enemy's invasion given them a heavy blow, continuously surrounding and raiding enemy strongholds, and intercepting and sniping enemy air-dropped reinforcements, making it impossible for the enemy to rescue each other. In the first half of July, the military and civilians in the mountains of Phong Dien County annihilated nearly 700 enemy troops, including the complete annihilation of three companies and four platoons of puppet troops. In the battle on July 2 to raid the enemy stronghold on Hill 416, local military and civilians, after 25 minutes of fierce fighting, completely annihilated the command posts of a puppet regiment and a battalion, killing and wounding about 300 enemy troops.

The report said that the people's liberation armed forces in Quang Tin Province, on June 28, 29, and July 3, smashed the enemy's "sweeping" operations in the Tra Bong area, annihilating over 720 enemy troops, and also destroying 37 enemy vehicles. On June 28, the local forces in Tra Bong County launched an ambush in a forest in Gia Loc Commune, completely annihilating an enemy company, and then fiercely intercepted the enemy's reinforcements, completely annihilating a U.S. company and a puppet platoon, and destroying 13 armored vehicles. The next day, the enemy, unwilling to admit defeat, sent three battalions of U.S. troops to reinforce Gia Loc Commune. That night, the people's liberation armed forces launched a fierce attack on the enemy stronghold, annihilating 450 enemy troops. On July 3, the U.S. aggressors sent infantry and many vehicles to try to clear the way for the retreating enemy, but they were again hit hard by the people's liberation armed forces, annihilating 180 more enemy troops and destroying 24 vehicles.

The military and civilians in Quang Tri, Thua Thien, and other provinces in South Vietnam, in early July, launched continuous attacks and achieved outstanding results.

The report said that on July 11, the liberation army in the northern part of Quang Tri Province ambushed the enemy on the road from New Forest to Ka Lu, completely annihilating a platoon of U.S. Marines. At the same time, the liberation army shelled U.S. engineers building fortifications on Hill 710, annihilating 40 enemy troops. On July 13, the liberation army again ambushed a company of U.S. Marines near Ka Lu. They waited until the enemy had all entered the ambush circle before opening fire and launching a charge, using bayonets to annihilate the enemy, completely annihilating two platoons. A platoon of U.S. Marines behind them fled desperately. The liberation army, taking advantage of the victory, pursued and annihilated the remaining enemy. Thus, in just 30 minutes of fierce fighting, the liberation army completely annihilated this company of U.S. Marines, seizing a large number of weapons, ammunition, and other military supplies.

The guerrilla forces in the Phu Loc area of Thua Thien Province, on July 5, 6, and 8, continuously attacked the enemy who were air-dropped along the 14th Highway for "sweeping" operations, and also raided U.S. strongholds, annihilating over 120 U.S. troops, destroying two bunkers, and shooting down one helicopter, with all 12 U.S. troops on board annihilated. In addition, the people's liberation armed forces in this province also attacked and pursued the enemy in the Dong Chieu area on July 6 and 7, annihilating over 60 U.S. troops and shooting down one helicopter.

The guerrilla forces in the Ben Cat area of Tuy Hoa Province, at the end of June and the beginning of July, launched multiple attacks on the enemy in villages such as Ben Doc and Bac Lang, annihilating over 100 U.S. aggressor troops, destroying and damaging 15 tanks and armored vehicles, and shooting down one helicopter.

The local forces in the Thanh Binh area of Quang Tin Province annihilated 44 U.S. and puppet troops on July 3 and 4.

The people's liberation armed forces in Binh Dinh Province, on July 12, intercepted the South Korean mercenary troops on the 19th Highway, annihilating many enemy troops, including a colonel commander.
