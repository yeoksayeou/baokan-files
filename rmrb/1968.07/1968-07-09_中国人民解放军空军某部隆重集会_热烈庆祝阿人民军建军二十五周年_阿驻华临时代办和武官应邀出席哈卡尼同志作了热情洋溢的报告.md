He expressed his thanks to the responsible comrades of the Air Force unit in their speech, where they enthusiastically praised the Albanian Party of Labor, the Albanian people, and the beloved leader Comrade Enver Hoxha. He said that an unbreakable friendship and close ties unite our two peoples, two parties, and two armies because we have a common ideological foundation in Marxism-Leninism, we are jointly carrying out the socialist revolution and socialist construction, we are jointly supporting the revolutionary movements of the people of the world, and we are jointly opposing imperialism led by the United States and modern revisionism centered around the Soviet revisionist renegade clique and the reactionaries of all countries.

After describing the glorious fighting history of the Albanian People's Army, Hakani enthusiastically praised the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao, which is achieving comprehensive victory, and strongly condemned the heinous crimes of U.S. imperialism's aggression against Vietnam and the Soviet revisionist leadership's efforts to help the U.S. imperialists extinguish the just wars of the people of the world.

The responsible comrades of the Air Force unit first spoke at the meeting. They warmly congratulated the Albanian People's Army on its glorious victories in the anti-imperialist and anti-revisionist struggles and in strengthening its revolutionary construction over the past 25 years under the leadership of Comrade Enver Hoxha and the Party of Labor.

This morning, when Babaani and Hakani, accompanied by Vice Director of the General Office of the Ministry of National Defense, Pan Zhenwu, and the responsible comrades of the leadership of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Air Force, Liang Pu, arrived at the Air Force unit's base, they were warmly welcomed by the unit's responsible comrades, Liu Zhitian, and the officers and soldiers. The officers and soldiers beat drums and gongs, repeatedly chanting slogans such as "Long live the fighting friendship and unity between the two parties, two countries, and two armies of China and Albania!" "Down with imperialism!" "Down with modern revisionism!" "Long live the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!" "Long live Comrade Enver Hoxha, the great leader of the Albanian people!" "Long live Chairman Mao, the great leader of the Chinese people!"

After the meeting, they watched the performance of revolutionary songs and dances by the unit's Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team, visited the "Soldier's Family History" clay sculpture exhibition, listened to the report on the experiences of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought by the responsible comrades of the flight squadron, Li Mingsheng, and inspected the unit's agricultural and sideline production.
