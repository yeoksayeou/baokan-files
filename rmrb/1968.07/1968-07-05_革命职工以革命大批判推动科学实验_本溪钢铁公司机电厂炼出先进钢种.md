Revolutionary workers at the Benxi Iron and Steel Company's Machine and Electrical Plant, with the help of a propaganda team from a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army, have used revolutionary criticism to drive scientific experiments. After successfully trial-producing China's first electric furnace hydraulic automatic device in December of last year, they recently used this equipment to successfully produce a high-quality advanced steel variety.

The successful trial production of this advanced steel variety not only greatly reduced costs but also broke the old convention that general stainless steel must be produced before high-alloy steel. This opens up a new path for China's steel industry to catch up with and surpass the world's advanced levels.

After successfully trial-producing China's first electric furnace hydraulic automatic device, the revolutionary workers of this plant decided to press on and break through the technical difficulties of not being able to produce high-quality alloy steel. However, due to the lingering effects of the "capitulationist" and "crawling" lines of the Chinese Khrushchev, as well as the worship of foreign goods, some people had insufficient understanding of the new steelmaking equipment. A few bourgeois technical "authorities" took the opportunity to mock and belittle the new steelmaking equipment produced during the Cultural Revolution, trying to downplay its significance. The PLA propaganda team, based on these circumstances, conducted an analysis and deeply realized that this was not just a matter of improving electric furnace steelmaking but a sharp and complex struggle between the two classes, two lines, and two roads in the field of scientific experiments—a political issue. We must arm the workers with Mao Zedong Thought, carry out revolutionary criticism, launch a sustained and proactive attack on the class enemy, and raise the workers' class struggle and line struggle consciousness.

With the help of the PLA propaganda team, the revolutionary workers of this plant first set up Mao Zedong Thought study classes, repeatedly studying Chairman Mao's teachings on class and class struggle, and carried out revolutionary criticism. Many revolutionary workers, based on their personal experiences, exposed and criticized the crimes of the Chinese Khrushchev in begging imperialism, suppressing mass movements, and opposing the path of self-reliance. In the trial production process, they also fiercely criticized the Chinese Khrushchev's line of relying on bourgeois "experts" and "authorities" to manage the factory, and the reactionary line of "technology first," breaking old rules and foreign frameworks.

Through revolutionary criticism, the class struggle and line struggle consciousness of the revolutionary workers were raised, promoting the revolutionization of people's thinking. The broad revolutionary workers vigorously emphasized proletarian politics, using Mao Zedong Thought to guide everything. They also followed Chairman Mao's great instruction of "grasp revolution, promote production," forming "three-in-one" groups, combining revolutionary workers, revolutionary cadres, and engineering and technical personnel, and combining design, manufacturing, and production and use units within and outside the factory. They pooled their strengths, with the revolutionary spirit of "moving mountains like Yu Gong," repeatedly trial-produced, and formed a new situation of "people's war" in conducting scientific experiments. The workers proudly said: The road is walked by people, and technology is learned through labor. As long as we firmly hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, we will definitely be able to overcome all difficulties and achieve success. Through the efforts of the workers, they successfully produced high-quality advanced steel varieties in just four months, which is another fruitful achievement of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

    革命职工以革命大批判推动科学实验
    本溪钢铁公司机电厂炼出先进钢种
    这种钢种的试炼成功，为我国炼钢工业赶超世界先进水平，开创了新的道路
    新华社沈阳四日电　本溪钢铁公司机电厂革命职工，在解放军某部毛泽东思想宣传队的帮助下，以革命大批判推动科学实验，在去年十二月试制成功我国第一台电炉液压自动装置后，又在最近利用这台设备成功地炼出了高质量的先进钢种。
    这种先进钢种的试炼成功，不但大大降低了成本，而且打破了先炼一般不锈钢才能炼高级合金钢的旧常规，为我国炼钢工业赶超世界先进水平，开创了新的道路。
    这个厂的革命职工，在试制成功我国第一台电炉液压自动装置后，决心乘胜前进，攻破本厂不能炼高质量合金钢的技术难关。但是，由于中国赫鲁晓夫的“投降主义”、“爬行主义”路线和崇拜洋货的余毒没有肃清，有些人对新炼钢设备的作用认识不足，还有个别资产阶级技术“权威”趁机跳出来，对在文化大革命中试制出来的新炼钢设备进行冷嘲热讽，极力贬低新炼钢设备的作用。驻厂解放军毛泽东思想宣传队根据这些情况，进行分析研究，深刻地认识到，这不仅是改进电炉炼钢的问题，更是一场尖锐复杂的两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争在科学实验方面的反映，是个政治问题。我们必须用毛泽东思想武装工人群众的头脑，开展革命大批判，向阶级敌人发动持续主动的进攻，提高工人的阶级斗争观念和路线斗争觉悟。
    这个厂的革命职工在解放军毛泽东思想宣传队的帮助下，首先开办了毛泽东思想学习班，反复学习毛主席关于阶级、阶级斗争的论述，开展了革命的大批判。许多革命职工结合亲身经历，揭露和批判了中国赫鲁晓夫乞求帝国主义、压制群众运动、反对自力更生道路的罪行。革命职工在试炼过程中，还狠批了中国赫鲁晓夫依靠资产阶级“专家”、“权威”治厂、“技术第一”的资产阶级反动路线，大破老规矩、洋框框。
    通过革命大批判，提高了革命职工的阶级斗争和路线斗争的觉悟，促进了人的思想革命化。广大革命职工大力突出无产阶级政治，用毛泽东思想统帅一切。他们还遵照毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大教导，组成“三结合”小组，实行革命工人、革命干部、工程技术人员三结合，厂内厂外的设计、制造、生产使用单位三结合，群策群力，以“愚公移山”的革命精神，反复试炼，形成了进行科学实验的“人民战争”的新局面。工人们豪迈地说：路是人走出来的，技术是在劳动中学出来的，只要我们坚定地高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，我们一定能够排除万难，获得成功。经过职工们的努力，终于用短短的四个月的时间，炼出了高质量的先进钢种，这是无产阶级文化大革命的又一丰硕成果。
