The triumphant song of the Cultural Revolution echoes across the land, with red flags flying high. The military and the people are united as one, writing a new chapter in supporting the army and loving the people. On a Sunday, the streets are bustling with people and vehicles, everywhere is a new scene. On the road, there are three people: Grandpa, Grandma, and a young girl. Grandpa works in a steel plant, Grandma is the team leader in a production brigade, and the young girl is a Red Guard from Hongwei Middle School, named Wang Hongfang. They are a family, and today they are going to visit a knitting factory. (Narrator) Hmm, learning from the advanced!

They soon arrive at the factory gate and stop to take a look. Oh, there's a sign that reads "Revolutionary Committee," the five characters shining brightly. Inside the gate stands a soldier, with a red cap badge and red collar insignia. He stands tall and proud, full of spirit and fighting spirit. Wang Hongfang seems to have noticed something, turning back to call her parents: "Dad!" "Yes!" "Mom!" "What?" "Look! The soldier at the gate, he was the platoon leader in our school during military training. He studies Chairman Mao's thoughts well, and his efforts are focused on 'practice.' He and I read the Little Red Book together, he and I expose the 'private' character together; he and I grasp the reform of education together, he and I fight against revisionism on the battlefield. He firmly supports the revolutionary faction, he dares to stand against the wind and fight against the waves; he is infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, his red heart forever toward the red sun." Hongfang speaks more and more enthusiastically, moving her father and mother. Grandma wipes her eyes and looks carefully, delighted and opening her mouth: "Yes! I also recognize this soldier, I dare to say he is surnamed Zhang. During the support agriculture period, he went to our production brigade, visiting every household to promote Mao Zedong Thought. He helped our village set up various study classes, helping our village to vigorously promote production and contribute strength. The class consciousness of the villagers has greatly improved, and the awareness of the line struggle is strong. The spiritual face has changed greatly, and people have changed their minds and the land has changed its appearance. The People's Liberation Army created by Chairman Mao is truly a good example for us to learn from."

Grandma speaks with great enthusiasm, opening her voice and shouting loudly: (Narrator) "Hey! Comrade Zhang—” She yells while walking forward, and Grandpa pulls her clothes. "Hey! What are you doing? Can't you see he's busy?" "This..." While speaking, they greet the soldier: Grandpa suddenly remembers something. He points his thumb at his wife and daughter and speaks: "This comrade is Zhang Aiqun, who came to support the left in our steel plant. Although the time was not long, he left a good impression on me. For the revolution, he is red-hearted, brave, and bold; for the revolution, he is not afraid of storms and waves; for the revolution, he is heart-to-heart with the left; for the revolution, he carries the red flag on his shoulders. He fights side by side with the workers, forming a deep bond of affection like the ocean. (Narrator) Chairman Mao said: 'Without an army of the people, there is nothing for the people.' The red political power is protected by the people's army, fearing no crazy enemies."

Grandpa and Grandma are still speaking, and little Hongfang runs forward to call the platoon leader: "Platoon leader!" "Yes!" Zhang Aiqun suddenly turns his head: "Ah! Isn't this Wang Hongfang from Hongwei Middle School? Why are you in the city? What makes you so happy?" Little Hongfang points behind her, and Zhang Aiqun recognizes Grandpa and Grandma: (Narrator) "Grandpa!" "Yes!" "Grandma!" "Yes!" "All three of you are out together, you must have an important mission on your shoulders." Little Hongfang quickly inserts: "Platoon leader, you've hit the nail on the head. Dad has a day off today, Mom is buying baskets for the brigade, and our family of three agreed to come and visit the knitting factory together." (Narrator) Oh, how thoughtful!

Grandpa says: "The soldier studies Chairman Mao's thoughts well, with a loyal heart. The knitting factory, with your help, has set a good example for us. I want to learn the good style of the soldier, I want to learn the good thoughts of the soldier, I want to learn the good study style of the soldier that combines learning and practice, I want to learn the good style of the soldier that closely connects with the masses..." Grandpa is still about to speak endlessly, and Grandma speaks from the side: "Hey, Little Zhang, you supported agriculture in our village last year, why are you here today?" Aiqun says: "We are the People's Liberation Army, holding the treasure book tightly and gripping the gun. We vow to defend Chairman Mao, the people, and the Party. Wherever Chairman Mao tells us to go, we go; wherever Chairman Mao tells us to charge, we charge. Chairman Mao tells us to support agriculture, we pack our bags and go to the village; Chairman Mao tells us to support industry, we move at the wind and go to the factory; Chairman Mao tells us to conduct military training, we take on the revolutionary burden; Chairman Mao tells us to defend the new red political power, we stand guard for it with all our hearts..."

The three of them listen more and more excitedly, praising in unison: "The People's Liberation Army is truly created by Chairman Mao and nurtured by Vice Chairman Lin, always performing new deeds, and is a good example for the people of the whole country to learn from." While speaking, Zhang Aiqun asks for leave from his superiors and leads the family of three to visit the factory.

    拥军爱民谱新章（山东快书）
    辛红　晚顺
    文化大革命凯歌响，祖国大地红旗扬，军民团结如一人，拥军爱民谱新章。星期天，大街上人来车往好热闹，到处一派新气象。马路上有这么三个人儿，大爷、大娘和一位小姑娘。老大爷在钢铁厂里当工人，老大娘在生产队里当队长，小姑娘是红卫中学的红卫兵，名字就叫王红芳。他们本是一家人，今天去参观针织厂。（白）嗯，学习先进嘛！他们转眼来到厂门口，停住脚步细观望。哟，木牌上写着“革命委员会”，五个大字放红光。门口里站着一位解放军，红色帽徽红领章。英姿飒爽多威武，精神抖擞斗志昂。王红芳好象看出了啥，回过头来喊爹娘：“爹！”“嗯！”“娘！”“哎！”“瞧！门口那位解放军，军训中在俺学校当过排长。毛泽东思想他学得好，功夫下在‘用’字上。他和俺一起同读红宝书，他和俺一起把‘私’字亮；他和俺一起把教改抓，他和俺一起批修上战场。他坚决支持革命派，他敢顶逆风战恶浪；他无限忠于毛主席，他一颗红心永向红太阳。”红芳越说越起劲，感动了她爹和她娘。老大娘拭了拭眼睛仔细看，惊喜万分开了腔：“对！这位解放军同志俺也认得，俺敢肯定他姓张。支农时去过咱们生产队，挨家挨户宣传毛泽东思想。帮咱庄大办各种学习班，帮咱庄猛促生产献力量。社员们阶级觉悟大提高，路线斗争观念强。精神面貌大改观，人换思想地换装。毛主席亲自缔造的解放军，真是咱学习的好榜样。”老大娘说得入了迷，放开嗓门高声嚷：（白）“哎！张——同——志！……”她一边喊一边朝前走，王大爷一把拉住她的衣裳。“嗨！你你你，你想干啥，你没看见人家正在忙？”“这……”说话间和解放军同志照了个面，王大爷猛然想起事一桩。他冲着老伴和女儿，翘着拇指把话讲：“这个同志姓张名叫张爱群，支左到过俺们钢铁厂。虽然时间不太久，可给俺留下了好印象。为革命，他心红志壮胆气豪，为革命，他不怕狂风和恶浪；为革命，他和左派心连心，为革命，他爱民红旗肩上扛。和俺工人并肩齐战斗，结下了鱼水深情似海洋。（白）毛主席说：‘没有一个人民的军队，便没有人民的一切。’红色政权有人民军队来保卫，不怕那阶级敌人逞疯狂。”大爷大娘正说话，小红芳跑上前去喊排长： “排长！”“哎！”张爱群猛地回过头：
  “啊！这不是红卫中学的王红芳吗？你来城里有啥事，为啥高兴成这个样？”小红芳用手往后指，张爱群才认出了大爷和大娘：（白）“大爷！”“嗯！”“大娘！”“哎！”“你们全家三口都出动，一定有重要任务压肩上。”小红芳急忙把话插：“排长，你的话说到了点子上。俺爸他今天过礼拜，俺妈来给队里买竹筐，俺一家三口约订好，俺一块来参观针织厂。”（白）嗬，想得真周到！大爷说：“解放军毛泽东思想学得好，一个忠字刻心上。针织厂在你们的帮助下，为俺树立了好榜样。俺要学，解放军的好作风，俺要学，解放军的好思想，俺要学，解放军学用一致的好学风，俺要学，解放军密切联系群众的好风尚……”王大爷还要滔滔不绝往下说，老大娘一旁开了腔：“哎，小张啊，你去年在俺庄里搞支农，咋今天到这里来了呢？”爱群说：“俺们是人民解放军，高擎宝书紧握枪。誓死保卫毛主席，保卫人民保卫党。毛主席叫冲俺就冲，毛主席叫闯俺就闯。毛主席叫俺去支农，俺打起背包进村庄；毛主席叫俺去支工，俺闻风而动进工厂；毛主席叫俺去搞军训，俺革命重担挑肩上；毛主席叫俺保卫红色新政权，俺全心全意为她站好岗……。”三个人越听越激动，异口同声齐赞扬：“解放军真不愧是毛主席亲手来缔造，林副主席亲手来培养，时时刻刻立新功，是全国人民学习的好榜样。”说话间，张爱群向上级请了假，领着一家三口去参观。
