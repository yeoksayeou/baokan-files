American aggressors have been running amok in Thailand, committing heinous acts, and piling up crimes. The Thanom selling-out clique has been shielding and protecting them, sparking immense indignation among the Thai people.

According to reports from Thai newspapers, American aggressors frequently engage in drunken misbehavior near their bases and recklessly drive vehicles. Recently, a U.S. military vehicle rammed into a taxi, killing four Thai people on the spot. A car driven by a U.S. military officer also collided with a car driven by a Thai person.

Reports indicate that American aggressors' planes, cars, and ships freely roam Thai airspace, territory, and waters, causing frequent incidents where Thai people are crushed, run over, or blown up. However, the U.S. military authorities, relying on so-called "diplomatic privileges," shield the criminals and refuse to hand over the murderers, allowing them to go free.

According to Thai newspapers, American aggressors have been repeatedly insulting and raping Thai women in various locations and U.S. military bases in Thailand. Recently, near the U.S. military base in Takhli, Nakhon Sawan Province, another innocent Thai woman was brutally killed by American soldiers. Previously, several bodies of Thai girls were found near this base. Local residents complained that these innocent victims were raped and then murdered by American aggressors. These criminals also roam free under the protection of "diplomatic privileges."

The Thanom selling-out clique, in a maddened state, has repeatedly tried to cover up the heinous crimes committed by American aggressors in Thailand. The puppet deputy prime minister, Bhumibol, shamelessly described the U.S. military's crimes as "trivial matters" and expressed the Thanom clique's "willingness to grant immunity to U.S. troops stationed in Thailand."

Thai public opinion is deeply dissatisfied with the American aggressors' rampage in Thailand and the Thanom clique's selling-out behavior. They point out that this is a disgrace to Thailand, and the Thai people cannot ignore it.

Recently, the "Voice of the Thai People" radio station strongly pointed out that the heinous crimes committed by American aggressors against the Thai people must be settled. The era of allowing American bandits to run amok is over, and the Thai people must demand blood debt from the U.S. imperialists.

    横行霸道  为非作歹　罪行累累
    美侵略军暴行激起泰国人民极大愤慨
    新华社二十八日讯曼谷消息：美国侵略军在泰国横行霸道，为非作歹，罪行累累，泰国他侬卖国集团对此纵容包庇，激起泰国人民极大的愤慨。
    据泰国报纸报道，美国侵略军经常在基地附近酗酒胡闹，驾驶汽车横冲直撞。不久前，一辆美国军用车撞毁一辆出租汽车，当场撞死四名泰国人。一名美国侵略军军官驾驶的汽车撞毁了一辆由泰国人驾驶的汽车。
    据报道，美国侵略军在泰国的飞机、汽车和军舰，任意在泰国的领空、领土和领海上乱闯，压死、撞死、炸死泰国人民的事件层出不穷。但是美国侵略军当局凭借所谓“外交特权”，对罪犯多方庇护，拒绝交出杀人凶手，让罪犯逍遥法外。
    据泰国报纸报道，美国侵略军在泰国各地和美军基地里恣意侮辱强奸泰国妇女的事件不断发生。最近，在那空沙旺府打卡里美军基地附近，又有一名无辜的泰国妇女惨遭美国兽兵杀害。在这以前，这个基地就曾发现过若干具泰国少女的尸体。当地居民控诉说，这些无辜的受害者都是被美国侵略军强奸后惨遭杀害的。这些美国侵略军也都在“外交特权”包庇下，逍遥法外。
    他侬卖国集团丧心病狂，竟然一再为美国侵略军在泰国犯下的滔天罪行开脱。傀儡副总理巴博厚颜无耻地把美军罪行说成是“微不足道的小事”，他还表示他侬集团“乐意给驻泰美军以豁免权”。
    泰国舆论对美国侵略军在泰国横行霸道和他侬集团的卖国行为，深为不满。他们指出，这是泰国的耻辱，泰国人民不能置之不理。
      “泰国人民之声”电台最近强烈指出，美国侵略军对泰国人民犯下的滔天罪行一定要清算，任凭美国强盗横行霸道的时代已经过去了，泰国人民一定要向美帝讨还血债。
