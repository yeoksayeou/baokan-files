The revolutionary committee of the Shijiazhuang Lead Wire Weaving Factory led the revolutionary workers to carry out a thorough and sustained revolutionary criticism. They fiercely criticized the "expert management" and other revisionist goods promoted by Chinese Khrushchev and his agents. This fully mobilized the enthusiasm and creativity of the revolutionary workers, powerfully promoting technological innovation and technological revolution throughout the factory. Under the impetus of the revolutionary criticism, the revolutionary workers of the entire factory took only over forty days to independently produce more than ten machines, achieving semi-mechanization of the entire factory and changing the long-standing backward production situation.

    革命的大批判推动了技术革新
    石家庄铅丝编织厂革命委员会带领革命职工深入持久地开展革命大批判，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人推行的“专家治厂”等修正主义黑货，充分调动了革命职工的积极性和创造性，有力地推动了全厂技术革新和技术革命。全厂革命职工在革命大批判的推动下，只用了四十多天的时间，就自力更生地制成了十多台机器，实现了全厂半机械化，改变了生产长期落后的面貌。（据新华社讯）
