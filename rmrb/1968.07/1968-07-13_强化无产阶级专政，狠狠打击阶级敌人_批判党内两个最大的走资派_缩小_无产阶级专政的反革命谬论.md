The dictatorship of the proletariat is the fundamental guarantee for consolidating and developing socialism. It is the fundamental guarantee for the proletariat to defeat the bourgeoisie and achieve socialist victory in the struggle between the two classes, two lines, and two roads, and to transition to communism. The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: “Throughout the entire socialist period, there are classes and class struggle. This class struggle is long-term, complex, and sometimes very intense. Our dictatorship apparatus cannot be weakened; it must be strengthened.”

After the proletariat seized power and after the basic completion of the socialist transformation of the ownership of the means of production, class struggle did not end; it only changed form. Under new historical conditions, the struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie has become more widespread, more complex, and more profound in many aspects. The overthrown bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes, though defeated, still harbor hopes of restoration and constantly seek opportunities to stage a comeback. The long-term existence of bourgeois influence has caused some party and state cadres to degenerate and become agents of the bourgeoisie. International imperialism and modern revisionism use both soft and hard tactics to subvert our country. Therefore, in the socialist historical stage, the continuation of class struggle is an objective law that is not subject to human will. International and domestic class enemies are colluding, constantly looking for opportunities, and attempting to use both armed subversion and “peaceful evolution” to overthrow the dictatorship of the proletariat and restore capitalism. They place their main hope on “peaceful evolution,” adopting strategies of corruption, infiltration, division, and subversion, using bourgeois agents within the proletarian dictatorship apparatus to carry out their evil deeds of subverting the dictatorship of the proletariat and restoring capitalism. A small handful of capitalist roaders, traitors, spies, and counter-revolutionaries who have infiltrated the party and government organs are the agents of the bourgeoisie. The Chinese Khrushchev is their representative. They have usurped many important party and government positions, forming a bourgeois command center within the proletarian dictatorship apparatus to oppose the proletarian command center led by Chairman Mao. Once the time is ripe, they will seize power and turn the dictatorship of the proletariat into a dictatorship of the bourgeoisie.

Therefore, under the dictatorship of the proletariat, the focus of class struggle remains the issue of power, that is, the proletariat must consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat, while the bourgeoisie seeks to overthrow it. This is the concentrated expression of the struggle between the two classes, two lines, and two roads throughout the entire socialist historical period, a life-and-death struggle. In this struggle for survival, the proletariat must fully utilize its own instrument of violence, the proletarian state apparatus, to suppress the resistance of the bourgeoisie. The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: “Our people’s democratic dictatorship is a powerful weapon to safeguard the fruits of the people’s revolution and to oppose the restoration plots of internal and external enemies. We must firmly grasp this weapon.”

The Chinese Khrushchev and another big capitalist roader in the party represent the interests of the Kuomintang reactionaries, imperialism, the bourgeoisie, and the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists. They openly oppose the great Marxist-Leninist and Mao Zedong Thought on the dictatorship of the proletariat. As early as 1956 and 1957, they colluded to oppose the dictatorship of the proletariat. One said, “Class struggle is basically over,” and the tasks of the dictatorship are “becoming smaller, not larger.” The other shouted, “Classes have basically been eliminated,” and the dictatorship is “becoming smaller, while democracy will expand.” Their sinister goal is to weaken and abolish the dictatorship of the proletariat and establish a bourgeois dictatorship.

They want to “shrink” the dictatorship and “expand” democracy, which means they are advocating for the bourgeoisie, landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists to demand democracy from the proletariat. The Chinese Khrushchev absurdly claims that “capitalists, landlords, and rich peasants will all enter socialism”; that after “joint public-private management,” capitalists “no longer want to resist socialism.” The other big capitalist roader in the party claims that “the bourgeoisie basically did not resist the socialist transformation of 1956.” In 1953, he shouted that the restriction on the electoral rights of landlord class members “will soon become unnecessary,” and that “there is generally no question of political rights for rich peasant class members, that is, they have political rights.” These two individuals completely deny the reactionary nature and bloody crimes of the bourgeoisie and the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, fully bowing down to the bourgeoisie and landlords, thus exposing their reactionary revisionist ugly faces in broad daylight.

They want to “shrink” the dictatorship and “expand” democracy, which in the political and ideological sphere means they want to promote bourgeois liberalization, allowing only the bourgeoisie to spread poison while not allowing the proletariat to criticize, opening the green light for the free flow of bourgeois ideology. The proletariat, to consolidate its political and economic dominance, must thoroughly criticize the old ideology, culture, customs, and habits of the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes, and must suppress the bourgeoisie to achieve further dominance in ideology. However, the other big capitalist roader in the party viciously attacks the proletarian revolutionaries for criticizing the reactionary bourgeoisie, saying they “want to gain fame through criticism, stepping on others’ shoulders to rise to power”; he screams for the bourgeoisie, saying that “people dare not write articles anymore,” and this is “the east wind suppressing the west wind, suppressing it, now we need to reason.” This is an open incitement for the bourgeoisie to launch a ferocious attack on the proletariat. They use their positions in the party to let all ghosts and monsters out of the bag, creating reactionary public opinion for the restoration of capitalism. When the proletariat just counterattacks, the Chinese Khrushchev gang immediately throws out the bourgeois slogan of “equality before truth,” completely denying the class nature of truth, attempting to protect the bourgeoisie and suppress the proletariat.

In summary, they want to “shrink” the dictatorship and “expand” democracy, which means they want to give democracy to a small handful of traitors, spies, capitalist roaders, and all counter-revolutionaries within the party, allowing them to freely carry out their counter-revolutionary crimes of opposing the party, opposing socialism, and opposing Mao Zedong Thought.

Can the proletariat give democracy to the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes? Can the proletariat weaken or even abolish the right to suppress class enemies? No, absolutely not! “With bourgeois democracy, there is no democracy for the proletariat and the working people.” If the Chinese Khrushchev’s bourgeois reactionary line prevails, the dictatorship of the proletariat will turn into a bourgeois dictatorship, the Kuomintang reactionaries will restore power, and the three big mountains will once again weigh down on the Chinese people. The proletarian revolutionaries and the broad revolutionary masses armed with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought will never allow the two biggest capitalist roaders in the party to succeed in their plots to “shrink” the dictatorship and “expand” democracy.

In the people’s internal affairs, the broadest people’s democracy must be implemented, and the dictatorship must be implemented over the bourgeoisie and all reactionaries. These are two inseparable aspects of the dictatorship of the proletariat. Only by consolidating and strengthening the dictatorship of the proletariat can the fundamental interests of the broad masses of the people be guaranteed, and the democracy of the broad masses of the people be fully developed. Only by fully developing the democracy of the broad masses of the people and mobilizing their revolutionary enthusiasm can the dictatorship of the proletariat be consolidated.

Chairman Mao has always taught us that in the people’s internal affairs, the democratic centralism system must be implemented, broad people’s democracy must be implemented, and the masses must be fully mobilized to effectively implement the dictatorship over class enemies. Our great leader Chairman Mao solemnly warns us: “Without broad people’s democracy, the dictatorship of the proletariat cannot be consolidated, and power will be unstable. Without democracy, without mobilizing the masses, without the masses’ supervision, it is impossible to effectively implement the dictatorship over reactionaries and bad elements, and it is also impossible to effectively reform them; they will continue to cause trouble and have the possibility of restoration. This issue must be alerted to, and I hope comrades will think about it carefully.”

The unprecedented proletarian cultural revolution has mobilized the broad masses of the people to the fullest extent. The broad revolutionary masses actively participate in the struggle against class enemies, further strengthening and consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat. The broad revolutionary masses armed with Mao Zedong Thought see through the class enemies the clearest and recognize them the most accurately. The Chinese Khrushchev and a small handful of traitors, spies, capitalist roaders within the party, who have hidden for so long and dug so deep, have been dug out by hundreds of millions of revolutionary masses and Red Guards. Those who are still hiding in dark corners, traitors, spies, counter-revolutionary two-faced individuals, and all counter-revolutionaries will also not escape the “golden eyes” of the broad revolutionary masses.

The closer the proletarian cultural revolution is to complete victory, the more complex and profound the struggle between the two classes, two lines, and two roads becomes. We must deeply understand Chairman Mao’s latest instructions, closely follow Chairman Mao’s great strategic deployment, firmly believe in and rely on the broad masses of the people, resolutely protect the broad masses of the people, unite all forces that can be united, and accurately and fiercely strike at a small handful of class enemies. We must fully unleash the tremendous power of mass dictatorship, further consolidate and strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat, develop the good situation, and comprehensively complete the great historical task of the first proletarian cultural revolution in human history!

    强化无产阶级专政，狠狠打击阶级敌人
    ——批判党内两个最大的走资派“缩小”无产阶级专政的反革命谬论
    炮兵直属机关无产阶级革命派
    无产阶级专政，是巩固和发展社会主义的根本保证，是无产阶级在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争中，战胜资产阶级，取得社会主义胜利，向共产主义过渡的根本保证。伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“整个社会主义阶段，存在着阶级和阶级斗争。这种阶级斗争是长期的、复杂的，有时甚至是很激烈的。我们的专政工具不能削弱，还应当加强。”
    在无产阶级夺得政权以后，在生产资料所有制的社会主义改造基本完成以后，阶级斗争并没有结束，只是改变了形式。在新的历史条件下，无产阶级和资产阶级之间的斗争，在许多方面变得更加广泛，更加复杂，更加深入。被推翻的资产阶级和一切剥削阶级，人还在，心不死，时时企图复辟。资产阶级的影响的长期存在，使党和国家机关工作人员中有些人蜕化变质，成为资产阶级的代理人。国际帝国主义和现代修正主义软硬兼施，千方百计地进行颠覆活动。因此，在社会主义这个历史阶段中，阶级斗争的继续，仍然是不以人们意志为转移的客观规律。国际国内的阶级敌人勾结在一起，一直在窥测方向，等候时机，妄图使用武装颠覆与“和平演变”的反革命两手，颠覆无产阶级专政，复辟资本主义。他们把主要希望寄托在
  “和平演变”上，采取腐蚀侵袭、分化瓦解、拉出去、打进来的反革命策略，通过在无产阶级专政机构内部的资产阶级代理人，进行颠覆无产阶级专政、复辟资本主义的罪恶勾当。混进党政机构内部的一小撮走资派、叛徒、特务、反革命分子，就是资产阶级的代理人，中国赫鲁晓夫则是他们的总代表。他们窃踞了不少重要党政职务，在无产阶级专政机构内部组成一个资产阶级司令部，对抗以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部。一旦时机成熟，他们就要夺取政权，变无产阶级专政为资产阶级专政。
    因此，无产阶级专政条件下的阶级斗争的焦点，仍然是政权问题，即无产阶级要巩固无产阶级专政，资产阶级要推翻无产阶级专政。这是两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争在整个社会主义历史时期的集中表现，是一场你死我活的斗争。在这场生死存亡的大搏斗中，无产阶级必须充分运用自己的暴力工具，即无产阶级的国家机器来镇压资产阶级的反抗。伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“我们的人民民主专政的国家制度是保障人民革命的胜利成果和反对内外敌人的复辟阴谋的有力的武器，我们必须牢牢地掌握这个武器。”
    中国赫鲁晓夫和党内另一个最大的走资派，代表国民党反动派利益，代表帝国主义、资产阶级和地、富、反、坏、右的利益，公开反对马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想关于无产阶级专政的伟大学说。早在一九五六年和一九五七年，他们就一唱一和，竭力反对无产阶级专政。一个说：“阶级斗争基本结束”，专政任务“愈来愈小了，不是愈来愈大了”。另一个就叫嚷：“阶级已经基本消灭了”，“专政愈来愈缩小，民主就要扩大”。他们的阴险目的，就是要削弱、取消无产阶级专政，实现资产阶级专政。
    他们要“缩小”专政，“扩大”“民主”，就是替资产阶级、地、富、反、坏、右向无产阶级争“民主”。中国赫鲁晓夫胡说什么“资本家、地主、富农都将进入社会主义”；资本家在“公私合营以后”“已经不愿意反抗社会主义了”。党内另一个最大的走资派则说什么“资产阶级对一九五六年的社会主义改造基本上没有反抗”。他在一九五三年就叫嚷对于地主阶级分子选举权的限制“在不久的将来就成为不必要的了”，“对于富农分子一般并不存在有无政治权利的问题，即是说他们是有政治权利的。”这两个家伙一笔抹煞资产阶级和地、富、反、坏、右的反动本性和血腥罪恶，完全跪倒在资产阶级、地主的脚下，这就把他们的反革命修正主义的丑恶嘴脸完全暴露在光天化日之下。
    他们要“缩小”专政，“扩大”“民主”，在政治思想领域里，就是要搞资产阶级自由化，只许资产阶级放毒，不许无产阶级批判，为资产阶级思想自由泛滥大开绿灯。无产阶级为了巩固自己在政治上、经济上取得的统治地位，必须彻底批判资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的旧思想、旧文化、旧风俗、旧习惯，必须压倒资产阶级，使无产阶级在思想上取得进一步的统治地位。而党内另一个最大的走资派却恶毒攻击无产阶级革命派批判资产阶级反动派是“想靠批判别人成名，踩着别人的肩膀自己上台”；声嘶力竭地为资产阶级喊冤叫屈，说什么搞得“人家不敢写文章了”，这是“东风压倒西风，压倒的，现在需要说理”。这是公开鼓动资产阶级向无产阶级猖狂进攻。他们利用在党内窃踞的职位，放手让一切牛鬼蛇神出笼，为复辟资本主义大造反革命舆论。而当无产阶级刚刚反击的时候，中国赫鲁晓夫一伙就迫不及待地抛出“在真理面前人人平等”这个资产阶级口号，根本否认真理的阶级性，妄图保护资产阶级，镇压无产阶级。
    总之，他们要“缩小”专政，“扩大”“民主”，就是要给混入党内的一小撮叛徒、特务、走资派和一切反革命分子以民主，让他们自由地进行反党、反社会主义、反毛泽东思想的反革命罪恶勾当。
    无产阶级能够给资产阶级和一切剥削阶级以民主吗？无产阶级能够削弱以至取消对阶级敌人行使镇压之权吗？不能，绝对不能！“有了资产阶级的民主，就没有无产阶级和劳动人民的民主”。如果让中国赫鲁晓夫资产阶级反动路线得逞，无产阶级专政就要变为资产阶级专政，国民党反动派就要复辟，三座大山就要重新压在中国人民的头上。用战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装起来的无产阶级革命派和广大革命人民群众，决不能让党内两个最大的走资派“缩小”专政，“扩大”“民主”的阴谋得逞。
    在人民内部实行最广泛的人民民主，对资产阶级和一切反动分子实行专政，是无产阶级专政不可分割的两个方面。只有巩固和强化无产阶级专政，才能保障广大人民群众的根本利益，最充分地发扬广大人民群众的民主。也只有充分发扬广大人民群众的民主，把广大人民群众的革命积极性充分调动起来，无产阶级专政才能巩固。
    毛主席历来教导我们，在人民内部实行民主集中制，实行广泛的人民民主，充分发动群众，才能对阶级敌人实行有效的专政。我们伟大的领袖毛主席谆谆告诫我们：“没有广泛的人民民主，无产阶级专政不能巩固，政权会不稳。没有民主，没有把群众发动起来，没有群众的监督，就不可能对反动分子和坏分子实行有效的专政，也不可能对他们进行有效的改造，他们就会继续捣乱，还有复辟的可能。这个问题应当警惕，也希望同志们好好想一想。”
    史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命，把广大人民群众最充分地发动起来了。广大革命群众积极参加对阶级敌人的斗争，进一步加强和巩固了无产阶级专政。用毛泽东思想武装起来的广大革命群众，对阶级敌人看得最清，认得最准。藏了那么久，钻得那么深的中国赫鲁晓夫等党内一小撮叛徒、特务、走资派，被亿万革命群众和红卫兵小将挖出来了。那些现在还隐藏在阴暗角落里的叛徒、特务、反革命两面派和一切反革命分子，也决逃不脱广大革命群众的“火眼金睛”。
    无产阶级文化大革命越接近全面胜利，两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争，就越复杂、越深刻。我们一定要深刻领会毛主席的最新指示，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，坚定地相信和依靠广大人民群众，坚决保护广大人民群众，团结一切可以团结的力量，稳、准、狠地打击一小撮阶级敌人，充分发挥群众专政的巨大威力，进一步巩固和强化无产阶级专政，发展大好形势，全面完成人类历史上第一次无产阶级文化大革命的伟大历史任务！
