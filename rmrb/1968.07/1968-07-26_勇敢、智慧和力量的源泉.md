The play "Attack on the White Tiger Regiment" has been performed several times, and each time I watch it, I receive a vivid education in Mao Zedong Thought.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Weapons are an important factor in war, but they are not the decisive factor; it is people, not things, that are decisive." The play "Attack on the White Tiger Regiment" consistently embodies this great thought of Chairman Mao. Through the story of the reconnaissance platoon leader Yang Weicai leading a spearhead squad to overcome obstacles, cross treacherous terrain, and eliminate all difficulties to directly strike the command center of the American puppet "White Tiger Regiment," the play powerfully demonstrates Chairman Mao's brilliant judgment that "all reactionaries are paper tigers." It vividly and concretely summarizes the revolutionary heroic spirit of daring to struggle and daring to win, which is characteristic of our People's Volunteer Army fighters and soldiers.

Yang Weicai, while leading the spearhead squad to strike the enemy command center, suddenly stepped on a landmine laid by the enemy. At this critical moment, he showed no fear, not considering his personal safety at all, but thinking only of the heavy responsibility on his shoulders. He calmly and firmly told the platoon leader Zhang Shun: "If I am martyred, you will take over my duties." He then, together with his comrades, loudly recited Chairman Mao's teachings: "This army has an indomitable spirit, it will trample all enemies underfoot, and will never be subdued by the enemy. No matter how difficult and dangerous the situation, as long as there is one person, that person will continue to fight." With swift actions, he removed the landmine, advanced victoriously, and successfully completed the mission of destroying the "White Tiger Regiment" command center.

Watching this play reminded me of an experience during the War of Liberation. In the summer of 1948, our troops had just finished the battle of Laohukou and, without rest, bravely launched the Xiangfan Campaign. At that time, my company, the Eighth Company, was honored to be tasked with the mission of spearheading the attack on Fancheng. The terrain of Fancheng was extremely treacherous. The city was guarded by an enemy brigade and a miscellaneous division. The enemy utilized the advantageous terrain of the high mountains to the south of the city to control the entire city from a high position. After the total attack began, our company, following Chairman Mao's tactical principles of finding the enemy's weak points, striking unexpectedly, and attacking when the enemy is unprepared, rushed into Fancheng with lightning speed. When my spearhead company approached the enemy brigade headquarters, the enemy immediately sealed off the path to the headquarters with light and heavy machine guns, making the situation extremely urgent. At this moment, our soldiers, disregarding their own safety, rushed forward under a hail of bullets, and a volley of hand grenades silenced the enemy's machine guns. The remaining enemy, awakened from their sleep, immediately organized a force several times larger than ours to launch a mad counterattack. In this situation of enemy superiority, our soldiers, with the heroic spirit of trampling all enemies and never being subdued, fought fiercely and eventually forced the enemy to surrender, paving the way for our main force to annihilate the enemy in Xiangfan.

The heroic deeds of Yang Weicai and his spearhead squad in attacking the "White Tiger Regiment," and the glorious history of struggle of our army over the past few decades, fully prove the directive of Comrade Lin Biao: "For our army, the best weapon is not the airplane, not the cannon, not the tank, not the atomic bomb. The best weapon is Mao Zedong Thought. The greatest combat effectiveness is the people armed with Mao Zedong Thought, who are brave and fearless of death." From our practical struggles, we deeply feel that Mao Zedong Thought is the soul of the revolutionary people, and Mao Zedong Thought is the source of courage, wisdom, and strength. What are these "white tigers" and "black tigers"? In the face of revolutionary fighters armed with Mao Zedong Thought, they are all paper tigers that cannot withstand a single blow!

To emphasize proletarian politics, to fully value the role of people, and to build the army politically, these are Chairman Mao's military thoughts and the magic weapon for our army to defeat the enemy. However, the Chinese Khrushchev and the counter-revolutionary revisionist element Luo Ruiqing, driven by their counter-revolutionary nature, have always sung the opposite tune to Chairman Mao's military thoughts and military line. They have been peddling the black goods of the bourgeois military line of "military first" and "technology first." Luo Ruiqing absurdly claims that in combat, the main thing is to fight with steel and technology, not with politics and bravery. In his view, as long as there are advanced weapons and high technology, the army can win battles. What nonsense!

Is it not true that Yang Weicai and his spearhead squad, with lightning speed, smashed the command center of the "White Tiger Regiment," relying on advanced weapons and technology? No! It was relying on the great, invincible Mao Zedong Thought!

Is it not true that in the Xiangfan Campaign, our People's Liberation Army, with just one company, annihilated a brigade and a division of the Kuomintang army, relying on advanced weapons and technology? No! It was relying on the great, invincible Mao Zedong Thought!

The ironclad facts give a resounding slap to the Chinese Khrushchev and the counter-revolutionary revisionist element Luo Ruiqing.

"The Attack on the White Tiger Regiment" vividly recreates the historical truth of our volunteer heroes annihilating the American imperialist paper tigers on the Korean battlefield, expressing the hearts of the revolutionary people and the broad masses of soldiers and fighters. We love it from the bottom of our hearts. We, the soldiers who are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, resolutely grasp our rifles and pick up our pens, vowing to defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line to the death, and let the new proletarian revolutionary literature, shining with the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought, forever occupy the socialist literary front!

    勇敢、智慧和力量的源泉
    济南部队活学活用毛泽东思想积极分子解放军某部团长  李财发
    《奇袭白虎团》这出戏，我看过几次。每看一次，都受到一次活生生的毛泽东思想的教育。
    毛主席教导我们：“武器是战争的重要的因素，但不是决定的因素，决定的因素是人不是物。”《奇袭白虎团》自始至终贯穿着毛主席的这一伟大思想。戏通过侦察排长杨伟才带领一个尖刀班，越障碍，跨天险，排除一切困难，直插美李王牌军“白虎团”指挥部的出色战斗，有力地证明了毛主席关于“一切反动派都是纸老虎”的英明论断；集中地、形象地概括了我人民志愿军指战员敢于斗争、敢于胜利的革命英雄主义精神。杨伟才在率领尖刀班直插敌人指挥部的途中，突然踩上敌人布下的地雷。在这千钧一发之际，他面无惧色，丝毫不考虑个人的安危，而是想到肩上的重任。他镇静而坚定地对班长张顺和说：“如果我牺牲了，你代替我的职务。”说着，和战友们一齐高声朗诵毛主席的教导：“这个军队具有一往无前的精神，它要压倒一切敌人，而决不被敌人所屈服。不论在任何艰难困苦的场合，只要还有一个人，这个人就要继续战斗下去。”他用敏捷的动作，排除了地雷，胜利前进，出色地完成了捣毁“白虎团”指挥部的任务。
    看了这出戏，使我联想到解放战争时期的一段经历。一九四八年夏季，我们部队刚刚结束老河口战斗，没来得及休整，就英勇地投入了襄樊战役。当时，我所在的八连，光荣地担任攻取樊城尖刀连的任务。樊城地势非常险要。城内驻守敌军一个旅和一个杂牌师。敌人利用城南高山的有利地形，居高临下，控制全城。总攻开始后，我们连遵照毛主席关于寻找敌人弱点，出其不意，攻其不备的战术原则，以闪电般的速度冲进樊城。在我尖刀连接近敌军旅部的时候，敌人便以轻、重机枪严密封锁住通往旅部的路口，情况十分紧急。这时，只见我们的战士奋不顾身，冒着枪林弹雨，冲上前去，一排手榴弹，就把敌人的机枪炸哑吧了。其余的敌人从睡梦中惊醒，立刻组织了大于我几十倍的兵力疯狂反扑。就在敌众我寡的困难条件下，战士们以压倒一切敌人、不被敌人所屈服的英雄气概，硬打硬拚，终于迫使敌人缴枪投降，为我军主力部队全歼襄樊之敌打开了通路。
    杨伟才率领尖刀班奇袭“白虎团”的英雄事迹，和我军几十年的光荣斗争史，充分证明林彪副主席指示的：“对我们军队来说，最好的武器不是飞机，不是大炮，不是坦克，不是原子弹，最好的武器是毛泽东思想。最大的战斗力是用毛泽东思想武装起来的人，是勇敢、不怕死。”我们从斗争的实践中深深体会到：毛泽东思想是革命人民的灵魂，毛泽东思想是勇敢、智慧和力量的源泉。什么“白老虎”“黑老虎”，在用毛泽东思想武装起来的革命战士面前，统统都是不堪一击的纸老虎！
    突出无产阶级政治，充分重视人的作用，从政治上建军，这是毛主席的建军思想，是我军克敌制胜的法宝。但是，中国赫鲁晓夫及反革命修正主义分子罗瑞卿，出于他们的反革命本性，一贯与毛主席的建军思想、建军路线大唱反调。他们竭力兜售“军事第一”“技术第一”的资产阶级军事路线的黑货。罗瑞卿胡说什么：作战主要就是打钢铁，打技术，而不是打政治、打勇敢。在他看来，只要有了精良的武器，技术高，军队就能打胜仗。真是胡说八道！
    难道说，杨伟才和他的尖刀班以闪电般的速度，砸烂了“白虎团”的指挥部，是靠的精良的武器和技术吗？不是！是依靠伟大的战无不胜的毛泽东思想！
    难道说，当年襄樊战役，我人民解放军仅以一个连的兵力，歼灭了国民党军队一个旅和一个师，是靠的精良的武器和技术吗？不是！靠的是伟大的战无不胜的毛泽东思想！
  钢铁般的事实，给了中国赫鲁晓夫及反革命修正主义分子罗瑞卿当头一棒。
    《奇袭白虎团》生动地再现了朝鲜战场上我志愿军英雄痛歼美帝纸老虎的历史真实，说出了革命人民和广大解放军指战员的心里话。我们从心眼里喜爱它。我们无限忠于毛主席的革命战士，坚决紧握枪杆，拿起笔杆，誓死捍卫毛主席的革命路线，让闪耀着毛泽东思想光辉的无产阶级革命新文艺，永远占领社会主义文艺阵地！
