At this crucial moment when the people of the entire nation are filled with revolutionary fervor and are striving to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, our great teacher Chairman Mao has once again issued a great call to arms: "Universities must be run. I mainly speak of institutions of higher learning for science and engineering. The system of education should be shortened, education should be revolutionized, and proletarian politics should take command. Follow the path of Shanghai Machine Tool Factory in training technical personnel from among workers. Select students from workers and peasants who have practical experience, let them study in schools for a few years, and then return to production practice." Chairman Mao's extremely important directive is a sharp weapon for thoroughly criticizing the revisionist line of education and smashing the bourgeois educational system; it is a battle program for training proletarian engineering and technical personnel, eliminating the distinction between mental and manual labor, and ensuring that our country will never change color. We will resolutely and unconditionally carry out Chairman Mao's directive, take the revolutionary path of Shanghai Machine Tool Factory, and on the basis of the existing workers and engineering and technical personnel in our factory, select more workers who are loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and have rich practical experience to take up posts as engineering and technical personnel, firmly grasping the leadership of engineering and technology in the hands of the working class.

Now, linking my personal experience with the study of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, I feel particularly close to them. He has spoken the words that we workers want to say. This is the greatest concern and trust for the working class. Someone like me, born into a family of porters, who as a child led my younger brother to pick up coal cinders, would never have had the opportunity to read and write, let alone become an engineering and technical personnel mastering scientific technology, without Chairman Mao. Every time I think of this, I cannot suppress my excitement, and I shout over and over again: Long live Chairman Mao! Long, long live Chairman Mao!

Under Chairman Mao's wise leadership, New China was born in victory in 1949. Soon, I entered Qingdao Cotton Mill No. 6 as a worker. I was overjoyed and always thought about spinning more yarn and better yarn to repay Chairman Mao's kindness. Therefore, I worked hard every day to reduce breakages, improve car operation skills, and increase production and quality, and I realized my wish. In 1951, the Party and Chairman Mao sent someone to help me summarize my operating experience, and as a result, I summarized a set of planned and regular fine spinning operation methods. Everyone praised it as a scientific operation method, but at that time I was just a teenager, and I did not understand the meaning of the words "science"! Through this matter, I came to understand more deeply that as long as one has a deep proletarian affection for Chairman Mao and has practical operating experience, one can create any miracle in the world. Therefore, we must follow Chairman Mao's instructions, "take the path of Shanghai Machine Tool Factory in training technical personnel from among workers," select workers with practical experience, and train them to become proletarian engineering and technical personnel. This is a matter of great importance for thousands of years and ten thousand years.

It was the Party and Chairman Mao who sent me to middle school and university. In 1962, I graduated from university and returned to the original factory where I worked. With theoretical knowledge, can one become a technical personnel who only talks and does not work, detached from labor, detached from reality, and detached from the masses? I followed Chairman Mao's instructions and resolutely took the correct path of not detaching from labor, not detaching from reality, and not detaching from the masses, treating the workshop as a battlefield and the masses as teachers. Only in this way can one always maintain the character of the working people, make the theoretical knowledge one has learned play a role in production, and continuously learn from the workers to transform one's thoughts. I saw that the labor intensity in the cotton cleaning workshop was high, there was no operating method, and the work was particularly hard, so I worked with the workers while discussing and studying with them, and finally summarized the "cotton cleaning workshop worker operating method." The workers were very satisfied, and I also learned a lot of valuable practical experience from the workers. This made me deeply realize that book knowledge is only useful through practice, and new knowledge can only be learned through practice. In addition to participating in two production shifts per week, I go to where there are difficulties in production and fight with the workers.

We will resolutely respond to Chairman Mao's great call to "revolutionize education" and severely criticize the revisionist black goods of Liu Shaoqi, eliminating their poisonous influence. In this way, Chairman Mao's great directive to "take the path of Shanghai Machine Tool Factory in training technical personnel from among workers" can be well carried out. At the same time, we must break the pedantic philosophy in teaching, make the courses concise and practical, and overcome the erroneous tendency of leading students to bury their heads in books and ignore proletarian politics. We will definitely hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, take Shanghai Machine Tool Factory as an example, and advance to victory along the course charted by Chairman Mao!

    遵照毛主席教导，走上海机床厂的道路
    青岛市革命委员会委员、青岛国棉八厂革命委员会负责人　郝建秀
    正当全国亿万革命人民满怀革命豪情，夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的重要时刻，我们伟大导师毛主席又一次向我们发出了伟大的战斗号召：“大学还是要办的，我这里主要说的是理工科大学还要办，但学制要缩短，教育要革命，要无产阶级政治挂帅，走上海机床厂从工人中培养技术人员的道路。要从有实践经验的工人农民中间选拔学生，到学校学几年以后，又回到生产实践中去。”毛主席这个极其重要的指示，是彻底批判修正主义教育路线，摧毁资产阶级教育制度的最锐利的武器；是培养无产阶级工程技术人员，消灭脑力劳动和体力劳动差别，保证我国永不变色的战斗纲领。我们坚决不折不扣地贯彻执行毛主席的指示，走上海机床厂的革命道路，在我厂现有工人工程技术人员的基础上，选拔更多的忠于毛主席、忠于毛泽东思想、忠于毛主席无产阶级革命路线、有丰富实践经验的工人到工程技术人员的岗位上来，把工程技术的领导大权牢牢掌握在工人阶级的手里。
    现在，联系我自己的亲身经历，学习毛主席的最新教导，感到特别亲切。他老人家说出了我们工人心里想说的话。是对我们工人阶级的最大关怀、最大信任。象我这个出身在搬运工人家庭，从小领着弟弟捡煤渣的人，没有毛主席，哪里有念书认字的机会，又怎么能成为掌握科学技术的工程技术人员。每当我想到这些的时候，我就抑制不住激动的心情，一遍又一遍地高呼：毛主席万岁！毛主席万万岁！
    在毛主席英明领导下，新中国在一九四九年胜利诞生。不久，我就进入青岛国棉六厂当工人。我高兴极了，时刻想着多纺纱、纺好纱，报答毛主席的恩情。因此，我就成天在减少断头、提高看车能力、提高产量和质量上下功夫，并且实现了自己的愿望。一九五一年，党和毛主席又派专人帮助我总结操作经验，结果总结出一套有计划、有规律的细纱工作法。大家都称赞这是科学的操作法，但当时我是个十几岁的女孩子，对“科学”这两个字的含义还不理解呢！通过这件事，使我越来越深刻的体会到，只要有了对毛主席深厚的无产阶级感情，有了实际操作经验，什么人间奇迹也能创造出来。因此，我们一定要遵照毛主席的教导，“走上海机床厂从工人中培养技术人员的道路”，选拔有实践经验的工人，培养成为无产阶级的工程技术人员。这是千年大计，万年大计。
    又是党和毛主席，送我进中学，上大学。一九六二年，我从大学毕业，又回到原来劳动的工厂。有了理论知识，是不是就可以做动嘴不动手，脱离劳动，脱离实际，脱离群众的技术人员呢？我按照毛主席的教导，坚决走不脱离劳动，不脱离实际，不脱离群众的正确道路，把车间当战场，把群众当先生。只有这样，才能始终保持劳动人民的本色，既使自己学到的理论知识，在生产中发挥作用，又能不断地向工人学习，改造自己的思想。我看到清花车间的劳动强度大，没有操作法，工作格外吃力，于是就一面和工人一起劳动，一面和工人座谈讨论，终于总结出“清花车间车工工作法”，工人很满意，我也向工人学到了很多宝贵的实际经验。这又使我深深地体会到，书本知识，只有通过实践才有用，也只有在实践中才能学到新的知识。我除了每星期进行两次跟班生产劳动以外，在平时生产中，哪里有困难，我就到哪里去，和工人战斗在一起。
    我们坚决响应毛主席再一次发出的“教育要革命”的伟大号召，狠狠批判中国赫鲁晓夫的修正主义黑货，肃清其毒害。这样，毛主席“走上海机床厂从工人中培养技术人员的道路”的伟大指示，才能很好地贯彻执行。同时，要大破教学中的烦琐哲学，做到课程精炼适用，克服把学生引向埋头读书，不问无产阶级政治的错误倾向。我们一定更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，以上海机床厂为榜样，沿着毛主席指引的航向胜利前进！
