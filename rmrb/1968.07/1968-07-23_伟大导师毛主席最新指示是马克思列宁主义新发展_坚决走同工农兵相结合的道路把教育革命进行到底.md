The latest instructions from our great leader Chairman Mao are a new development of Marxism-Leninism. We must resolutely follow the path of integrating with workers, peasants, and soldiers to carry the educational revolution to the end.

The entire country's revolutionary committees and hundreds of millions of military and civilian personnel enthusiastically hail the issuance of Chairman Mao's latest instructions. They firmly declare that they will study Chairman Mao's latest instructions and the battle orders issued by the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin seriously, and combine study with practice to carry them out without any deviation.

Recently, Chairman Mao profoundly pointed out: "Universities still need to be run. Here, I am mainly talking about technical and engineering universities. However, the school system should be shortened, education should be revolutionized, and proletarian politics should be in command. We should follow the path of the Shanghai Machine Tool Factory in cultivating technical personnel from among workers. We should select students from workers and peasants with practical experience, let them study in schools for a few years, and then return to production practice."

The New China News Agency reported on July 22 that our great leader Chairman Mao recently profoundly pointed out: "Universities still need to be run. Here, I am mainly talking about technical and engineering universities. However, the school system should be shortened, education should be revolutionized, and proletarian politics should be in command. We should follow the path of the Shanghai Machine Tool Factory in cultivating technical personnel from among workers. We should select students from workers and peasants with practical experience, let them study in schools for a few years, and then return to production practice."

Members of revolutionary committees at all levels across the country and the broad masses of revolutionary cadres, revolutionary masses, and PLA combatants from all fronts enthusiastically hail the issuance of Chairman Mao's latest instructions. They say that Chairman Mao's great call is the battle program for carrying the proletarian educational revolution to the end and is a long-term strategy for preventing revisionism. We must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, resolutely and comprehensively implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and steadfastly advance along Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, determined to carry the educational revolution to the end and achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Chairman Mao's latest instructions have spread throughout the country, and the cities and countryside are in a state of jubilation. The broad masses of revolutionary cadres, workers, poor and lower-middle peasants, youth students, revolutionary intellectuals, revolutionary cadres, and PLA combatants are jubilant and excited, shouting, "Long live Chairman Mao! Long, long live Chairman Mao!" They have repeatedly studied and disseminated the important editorial note of the People's Daily on Chairman Mao's latest instructions and the investigative report "From the Shanghai Machine Tool Factory, Seeing the Path of Cultivating Engineering and Technical Personnel." They have received great education and inspiration. The revolutionary committees of Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, and many provinces and autonomous regions have held meetings of their standing committees or plenary sessions immediately after the issuance of Chairman Mao's latest instructions to study them seriously and deeply understand them, and have made resolutions or issued notices, expressing their determination to implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions. The Shanghai Municipal Revolutionary Committee held an expanded meeting at the Shanghai Machine Tool Factory this afternoon. Some local revolutionary committees have started holding classes to implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions from today. Many local factories, mines, enterprises, institutions, schools, and PLA garrisons have held discussion meetings, celebration meetings, oath-taking meetings, and some have even marched in the rain at night to express their determination to implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions. The revolutionary cadres and the broad masses of revolutionary people and PLA combatants from all fronts across the country, with boundless loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, are determined to launch a great wave of propaganda, study, and implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions with the greatest political enthusiasm and with lightning speed.

Chairman Mao's latest instructions are the battle program for carrying the proletarian educational revolution to the end and a powerful ideological weapon for preventing revisionism.

Members of revolutionary committees at all levels, revolutionary cadres, broad masses of workers, poor and lower-middle peasants, youth students, revolutionary intellectuals, revolutionary cadres, and PLA combatants have today, in their study and discussion sessions, enthusiastically hailed the great leader Chairman Mao's latest instructions, which have extremely great and far-reaching significance for achieving a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and preventing revisionism.

Today's plenary session of the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee and the expanded meeting of the Shanghai Municipal Revolutionary Committee believe that Chairman Mao's latest instructions are the most powerful ideological weapon for achieving a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and preventing revisionism, and for our country to successfully carry out socialist construction and launch a new industrial revolution, pointing the way forward. Participants in the expanded meeting of the Shanghai Revolutionary Committee pointed out that the great leader Chairman Mao personally affirmed the path of cultivating engineering and technical personnel at the Shanghai Machine Tool Factory and made extremely important instructions, which is the greatest encouragement, greatest education, greatest support, and greatest spur for the Shanghai proletariat and revolutionary people.

The ongoing standing committee meeting of the Shanxi Provincial Revolutionary Committee has seriously studied and discussed Chairman Mao's important instructions. Everyone unanimously believes that Chairman Mao's latest instructions are the guiding light for the proletarian educational revolution. It has an immeasurable great significance for cultivating communists, uprooting the roots of revisionism, and ensuring that our party and country will never change color.

Some leading comrades and staff members of the revolutionary committees of Guangdong Province, Guangzhou City, and various places in Guangdong held a study and discussion meeting tonight. They pointed out: Chairman Mao's instructions have pointed out the fundamental path for cultivating successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause, which will have a profound impact on the proletarian revolution.

At the standing committee meeting of the Jilin Provincial Revolutionary Committee held today, two Red Guards who serve as standing committee members excitedly said: Chairman Mao's latest instructions have announced the complete failure of the revisionist educational and scientific and technological lines of Liu Shaoqi. We will definitely take Chairman Mao's latest instructions as our battle program and carry the educational revolution to the end. The standing committee meeting of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region Revolutionary Committee was held this afternoon to seriously study and discuss. In their speeches, they unanimously agreed that Chairman Mao's latest and extremely important instructions on educational revolution are a great battle call to carry the proletarian educational revolution to the end, a guide to the laborization of intellectuals and the intellectualization of laboring people, and a long-term strategy for preventing revisionism for a hundred years and a thousand years.

Representatives attending the meeting of the representatives of the "Four Good" units of the Navy and the Second Conference of Active Learners and Appliers of Mao Zedong Thought of the Beijing Garrison Artillery, and the combatants of the Beijing Garrison carrying out the "Three Supports, Two Militaries" tasks, unanimously agreed in their discussions: Chairman Mao's latest instructions are the most timely, the most brilliant, and the most correct, speaking the hearts of hundreds of millions of workers, peasants, and soldiers. They said, at critical moments of the revolution, the great leader Chairman Mao always timely guides us, leading us from victory to victory. Chairman Mao's latest instructions are the grand program for cultivating successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause and are also the fundamental guarantee for our socialist state to never change color.

The broad masses of workers and poor and lower-middle peasants in the Zunyi area of Guizhou Province said, Chairman Mao's latest instructions speak the hearts of us workers and poor and lower-middle peasants. We workers and poor and lower-middle peasants must enter universities, study Mao Zedong Thought, and truly grasp scientific and technological knowledge in the hands of the working class, cultivating a scientific and technological team that is loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

In the book "The Socialist High Tide in China's Countryside," Chairman Mao once made the following remarks on an article describing the cooperative movement in Dongwang Village, Xinghe County, Hebei Province: "Socialism, this new thing, its birth, must go through a serious struggle with the old things to be realized." After hearing Chairman Mao's latest instructions, the poor and lower-middle peasants of Dongwang Production Brigade said with deep feelings that we must implement Chairman Mao's great instructions, definitely grasp the class struggle and the struggle between the two lines, resolutely smash the sabotage and obstruction of class enemies. They expressed their determination to firmly grasp the pen, shoulder the hoe, and hold the gun, change heaven and earth, build a good socialist new countryside, thoroughly smash the plot of class enemies to restore capitalism, and ensure that the proletarian state will never change color.

Firmly implement Chairman Mao's proletarian educational line, criticize the revisionist educational line, and follow the path of integrating with workers, peasants, and soldiers.

Chairman Mao's great instructions have spread to factories, rural areas, schools, institutions, and military barracks, and everywhere is in a state of jubilation. The Revolutionary Committee of the First Machine Tool Factory in Beijing immediately printed several thousand copies of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, beating drums and gongs, and distributing them to the workers. Many old workers excitedly said: Chairman Mao has spoken the hearts of us workers! Chairman Mao's great instructions are a new development of Marxism-Leninism. The broad masses of revolutionary workers of the Anshan Iron and Steel Company, combining their own experiences, enthusiastically praised the unparalleled brilliance and correctness of Chairman Mao's latest instructions. They said, technical personnel cultivated from among workers have the deepest feelings for Chairman Mao, listen to Chairman Mao's words the most, dare to think, dare to break through, dare to do, and are the closest to the broad masses of workers. They can create miracles.

The Party branch secretary of Dazhai Brigade, Xiyang County, Shanxi Province, Chen Yonggui, excitedly said, Chairman Mao's latest instructions are shining with gold, speaking the hearts of us broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, pointing out the path of school educational revolution. The great leader Chairman Mao has long taught us: "Education must serve proletarian politics and must be combined with productive labor. The laboring people must be intellectualized, and intellectuals must be laborized." However, Liu Shaoqi has been vigorously promoting the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line, allowing the bourgeois intellectuals to long dominate our schools, keeping a large number of outstanding workers and peasant children out of universities. The kind of universities that cultivate many young people who cannot operate machines when they study engineering and cannot farm when they study agriculture, have no skills, and look down on laboring people, full of thoughts of fame and wealth. We must comprehensively implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, thoroughly break the old bourgeois educational system, and change the kind of universities that are detached from proletarian politics, detached from reality, and detached from the masses into universities that serve proletarian politics, into universities that go to the masses and come from the masses, and into universities that go to practice and come from practice.

The comrades of the Medical Department of a certain unit in Baoding, Hebei Province, relying on the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, safely removed a ninety-jin tumor from the abdomen of a community member, Zhang Qiuju, under difficult conditions. They said with deep feelings after hearing Chairman Mao's latest instructions that with Mao Zedong Thought in command, we dared to break the bourgeois foreign teachings and old frameworks and dared to declare war on Liu Shaoqi's bourgeois reactionary medical line. In the future, we will unswervingly follow the path of integrating with the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers as indicated by Chairman Mao, serve the people wholeheartedly, and create new achievements for the people. The combatants of a certain unit stationed on the front line of the East China Sea said, university students educated according to Chairman Mao's instructions come from the masses of workers and peasants and go to the masses of workers and peasants. Such university students we trust, we can get along with, and we can use. We will definitely work with the broad revolutionary teachers and students to carry the educational revolution to the end.

Many graduates of colleges and universities in the capital, after hearing Chairman Mao's latest instructions, were moved to tears and extremely excited. They wrote down their resolutions again to go to the countryside, factories, mines, borders, and grassroots levels. The broad masses of revolutionary cadres and revolutionary teachers and students of Shanghai Jiao Tong University, with boundless loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, solemnly declared before Chairman Mao's portrait: We are determined to highlight proletarian politics, with your great thoughts in command, further criticize Liu Shaoqi's revisionist educational line, thoroughly discard the airs of university students, regard workers, peasants, and soldiers as our teachers, and be lifelong students of workers, peasants, and soldiers.

The broad masses of revolutionary teachers and students of Harbin Institute of Technology said: Under the control of Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line, a small group of capitalist roaders in the school tried to turn the university into a so-called "engineer's cradle," which is to cultivate students into a special stratum detached from the masses of workers and peasants. Chairman Mao's latest instructions have once again pointed out the direction for us. We must resolutely break the old bourgeois educational system and follow the bright path of integrating with the masses of workers and peasants to become reliable successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause.

The combatants of the "Iron and Steel Second Company" of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army, who are carrying out military training at Hunan First Normal School where Chairman Mao once studied and engaged in revolutionary activities, and all revolutionary teachers and students of the school said, Chairman Mao, in his youth, combined study with deepening into the masses of workers and peasants, with an umbrella and a pair of straw sandals, traversing mountains and rivers, visiting the poor and inquiring about their hardships, setting a brilliant example of integrating with the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers for revolutionary youth. Today, Chairman Mao's latest instructions have once again most timely and clearly pointed out the direction of the educational revolution for us. We must take Chairman Mao's latest instructions as the guideline and turn our school into a red school of Mao Zedong Thought.

The combatants of the military training team of Tianjin Yan'an Middle School and all revolutionary teachers and students said with great enthusiasm that whenever the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution develops to a critical moment, the great leader Chairman Mao always has a far-sighted vision and points out the direction of the battle for us. We must take Chairman Mao's latest instructions as our weapon, thoroughly criticize Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line, and resolutely follow the brilliant path of integrating with workers, peasants, and soldiers as indicated by Chairman Mao.

Revolutionary teachers and students of Xi'an University of Metallurgy and Architecture, Xi'an Jiaotong University, and Northwest Industrial University pointed out in their study and discussion sessions that university students come from workers, peasants, and soldiers and return to workers, peasants, and soldiers. This is the fundamental path to cultivate scientific and technological talents who serve proletarian politics and have practical experience. In the past, some who went out of the family door into the school door and out of the school door into the institutional door, these "three-door" cadres, not only detached from the masses of workers and peasants but also in terms of professional skills, are people who cannot do big things and do not want to do small things. We are determined to follow the revolutionary course indicated by Chairman Mao, walk the path of integrating with workers and peasants, and carry the proletarian educational revolution to the end!

Enthusiastically hail the great changes brought about by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in all aspects, and wholeheartedly support new things in socialism.

Our great leader Chairman Mao respects the pioneering spirit of the masses the most and supports revolutionary new things the most. Revolutionary cadres and the broad masses of workers and peasants across the country have studied Chairman Mao's great instructions and the investigative report of the Shanghai Machine Tool Factory, and are extremely excited. They pointed out that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao has brought about great changes in all aspects, showing the strong vitality of socialist new things. The boundless wisdom and strength hidden in the broad revolutionary masses will be further unleashed in the cultural revolution, creating many miracles that bourgeois mediocrities and right-wing conservatives could not have imagined. We advise those who suffer from myopia but are not stubbornly reactionary capitalist roaders to broaden their vision, and advise those who look down on workers and peasants and think they are great to put down their airs and quickly catch up with the majestic steps of hundreds of millions of revolutionary people.

Many comrades of the Henan Provincial Revolutionary Committee said, we can see from the experience of Lingbao County and the Shanghai Machine Tool Factory that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao is blooming with brilliant flowers and bearing abundant fruits in our country. We must wholeheartedly support socialist new things and let them grow vigorously.

The revolutionary workers and technical personnel of the Lanzhou Petroleum Chemical Machinery Factory, in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, brandished the thousand-jin hammer of Mao Zedong Thought, smashed the old frameworks of revisionism, and successfully developed more than forty new products in just the past half year. The revolutionary workers and technical personnel of the Hangzhou Machine Tool Factory, in the face of limited experience and poor equipment conditions, broke the foreign teachings and old frameworks, and designed and manufactured two lathes that reached international advanced levels in the past year. The revolutionary workers of these two factories excitedly said, in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the great achievements we have made in the field of science and technology fully prove that the teachings of our great leader Chairman Mao, "The most intelligent and talented are the most experienced warriors," "The humble are the most intelligent! The noble are the most stupid," are unshakable truths.

After Chairman Mao's latest instructions were spread to the advanced collective of studying the works of Chairman Mao in the Air Force, which has created outstanding achievements in reforming flight training, the pilots excitedly said: We follow the teachings of the great leader Chairman Mao, "The school system should be shortened, and education should be revolutionized," reform flight training, train new pilots based on the needs of actual combat, and follow the path of "practice, cognition, practice again, cognition again," greatly shortening the training time. In just ten months, we have quickly taught new soldiers who have never touched an airplane to fly the silver eagle into the sky of our motherland. This is a great victory of Mao Zedong Thought. Chairman Mao's latest instructions have pointed out the direction for us to continue to advance. We are determined to follow the path of educational revolution indicated by Chairman Mao, fly the red line indicated by Chairman Mao, always highlight proletarian politics, defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and safeguard the great achievements of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, forever be the red sentinels in the sky!

Promote the revolutionary learning style of combining theory with practice, and comprehensively implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions.

Members of revolutionary committees at all levels, revolutionary cadres, revolutionary masses, and PLA combatants across the country have studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions and expressed their determination to promote the revolutionary learning style advocated by Chairman Mao, immediately implement and seriously carry out, turning Chairman Mao's great instructions into the conscious revolutionary actions of hundreds of millions of revolutionary masses. Responsible comrades of revolutionary committees at all levels across the country have expressed that they will take the lead in studying and implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions well. They will quickly organize forces to go to factories, schools, and rural areas to fully propagate Chairman Mao's latest instructions, quickly implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions. They will use Chairman Mao's latest instructions as a weapon to severely criticize Liu Shaoqi's revisionist educational line and scientific and technological line, resolutely guide the broad masses of intellectuals to follow the path of integrating with the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers. They must cherish the deep proletarian feelings of being loyal to Chairman Mao, resolutely run schools, factories, and various undertakings with proletarian politics, and turn all industries into red schools of Mao Zedong Thought. The broad masses of revolutionary teachers and students in colleges and universities across the country have expressed that they will definitely act according to Chairman Mao's latest instructions, discard the airs of intellectuals, and in the three great revolutionary movements of class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experiment, change their worldview, thoroughly break with all the old traditional forces of the exploiting classes, thoroughly break with the "self," and quickly catch up with the forward steps of hundreds of millions of revolutionary people. The broad revolutionary masses and PLA combatants from all fronts across the country have firmly expressed that they will act immediately upon hearing Chairman Mao's latest instructions and the battle orders issued by the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, study them seriously, combine study with practice, implement them without any deviation, and resolutely follow the direction indicated by Chairman Mao to carry the educational revolution to the end and carry the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end!

    在《中国农村的社会主义高潮》一书中，毛主席曾经对一篇描述河北省新乐县东王庄合作化运动的文章作过这样的批示：“社会主义这样一个新事物，它的出生，是要经过同旧事物的严重斗争才能实现的。”东王庄大队的贫下中农听到毛主席的最新指示以后，他们深有体会地说，我们要贯彻执行毛主席的伟大指示，一定要狠抓阶级斗争和两条路线的斗争，坚决粉碎阶级敌人的阻挠和破坏。他们表示，要坚决握好笔杆子，扛好锄杆子，抓住枪杆子，改天换地，建设好社会主义的新农村，彻底粉碎阶级敌人复辟资本主义的阴谋，保证无产阶级的江山永不变色。

    山西省昔阳县大寨大队党支部书记陈永贵激动地说，毛主席的最新指示字字句句闪金光，说出了我们广大贫下中农的心里话，指出了学校教育革命的道路。伟大领袖毛主席早就教导我们说：“教育必须为无产阶级政治服务，必须同生产劳动相结合。劳动人民要知识化，知识分子要劳动化。”可是，中国赫鲁晓夫却竭力推行反革命修正主义教育路线，让资产阶级知识分子长期统治着我们的学校，使大批的有实践经验的优秀工人、农民子弟被关在大学门外。这种学校培养出的许多青年人，学工不会开机器，学农不会种地，本事没有，还看不起劳动人民，名利思想一大堆。我们一定要全面落实毛主席的最新指示，彻底打破旧的资产阶级教育制度，把过去那种脱离无产阶级政治、脱离实际、脱离群众的大学，变成为无产阶级政治服务的大学，变成从群众中来到群众中去的大学，变成从实践中来到实践中去的大学。

    首都大中学校的许多毕业生在听到毛主席的最新指示以后，热泪盈眶，万分激动，他们纷纷地再一次写下了到农村、工矿、边疆和基层去的决心书。上海同济大学广大无产阶级革命派和革命师生，怀着对伟大领袖毛主席的无限忠诚，在毛主席像前庄严地宣誓：我们决心突出无产阶级政治，以您的伟大思想挂帅，进一步批判中国赫鲁晓夫的修正主义教育路线，彻底丢掉大学生的架子，拜工农兵为师，做一辈子工农兵的小学生。
    哈尔滨工业大学广大革命师生说：过去在中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义教育路线把持下，学校一小撮走资派企图把工大办成所谓“工程师摇篮”，就是要把学生培养成脱离工农群众的特殊阶层。毛主席的最新指示又一次给我们指明了方向，我们要坚决打破旧的资产阶级教育制度，走和工农群众相结合的光明大道，做无产阶级革命事业的可靠接班人。
    在毛主席曾经学习和进行过革命活动的湖南省第一师范学校执行军训任务的人民解放军某部“钢铁红二连”指战员和全校革命师生说，毛主席在青年时代就一边学习，一边深入工农群众，一把雨伞，一双草鞋，跋山涉水，访贫问苦，为革命的青年树立了和工农兵群众相结合的光辉榜样。今天，毛主席的最新指示又一次最及时、最明确地给我们指明了教育革命的方向。我们一定要以毛主席的最新指示为纲，把我们的学校办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校。
    天津市延安中学军训团指战员和全校革命师生满怀激情地说，每当无产阶级文化大革命发展到关键时刻，伟大领袖毛主席总是高瞻远瞩，给我们指出战斗的方向。我们一定以毛主席最新指示为武器，彻底批判中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义教育路线，坚决走毛主席指出的与工农兵相结合的光辉道路。
    西安冶金建筑学院、西安交通大学、西北工业大学革命师生，在学习座谈时指出，大学生从工农兵中来，再回到工农兵中去，这是造就为无产阶级政治服务的、具有实践经验的科技人材的根本道路。过去有些出了家门进校门，出了校门进机关门的“三门”干部，不但脱离工农群众，就是在业务上也是一个大事做不了，小事不愿做的庸人。我们决心沿着毛主席指引的革命航向，走与工农兵结合的道路，把无产阶级教育革命进行到底！
      热烈欢呼无产阶级文化大革
  命在各方面引起的伟大变革，满
  腔热情支持社会主义新事物
    我们的伟大领袖毛主席最尊重群众的首创精神，最支持革命的新生事物。各地无产阶级革命派和广大工农兵学习了毛主席的伟大指示和上海机床厂的调查报告，无比兴奋。他们指出，毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命引起了各方面的伟大变革，显示了社会主义新事物的强大生命力。广大革命人民群众中蕴藏着的无穷智慧和力量，必将在文化大革命中进一步焕发出来，创造出许多为资产阶级庸人和右倾保守主义者所意想不到的奇迹。我们要奉劝那些患有近视症但还不是顽固不化的走资派的人们把眼光放远一些，奉劝那些轻视工农、自己以为很了不起的大学生放下架子，迅速赶上亿万革命人民前进的雄伟步伐。
    河南省革命委员会的许多同志说，我们从灵宝县和上海机床厂的经验可以看出，毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命，正在我国开出一朵朵灿烂之花，结出累累的丰硕果实。我们一定要满腔热情地扶植社会主义新事物，让它们茁壮地成长。
    兰州石油化工机械厂的革命工人和技术人员，在无产阶级文化大革命中奋起毛泽东思想千钧棒，砸烂了修正主义的旧框框，仅最近半年来就试制成功了四十多种新产品。杭州机床厂革命工人和技术人员，在经验少、设备条件差的情况下，打破洋教条、旧框框，去年以来自行设计制造出了两台达到国际先进水平的磨床。这两个厂的革命职工兴奋地说，在无产阶级文化大革命中，我们在科学技术方面所取得的伟大成就，充分证明伟大领袖毛主席说的“最聪明、最有才能的，是最有实践经验的战士”、“卑贱者最聪明！高贵者最愚蠢”的教导，是颠扑不破的真理。
    毛主席的最新指示传到空军学习毛主席著作先进集体、在改革飞行训练中创造了卓越成绩的某部飞行中队以后，飞行员们激动地说：我们遵循伟大领袖毛主席“学制要缩短，教育要革命”的教导，改革飞行训练，从实战需要出发训练新飞行员，走“实践、认识、再实践、再认识”的道路，大大缩短了训练时间，只用了十个月，就使从来没有摸过飞机的新战士，很快学会驾驶银鹰飞上祖国长空，这是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。毛主席的最新指示，给我们指出了继续前进的方向。我们决心走毛主席指引的教育革命道路，飞毛主席指引的红色航线，永远突出无产阶级政治，捍卫毛主席的革命路线，为保卫无产阶级文化大革命的伟大成果，永做空中的红哨兵！
