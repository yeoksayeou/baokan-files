The revolutionary committee of Zhangjiakou Coal Mine Machinery Factory, with the help of the stationed People's Liberation Army, has mobilized the broad masses of revolutionary workers to firmly grasp class struggle and carry out in-depth revolutionary criticism. The revolutionary and production situation is excellent, and by the end of the first half of the year, the factory has completed 87% of its annual production quota for spare parts.

Severely Criticizing "Profit as the Commander," Establishing a Comprehensive Perspective

In April, the Ministry of Coal held a meeting on the production of coal mine spare parts, proposing the task of producing more spare parts. The revolutionary committee of the Coal Machinery Factory, in accordance with Chairman Mao's instructions on "grasping revolution and promoting production," seriously discussed how to better complete the task. During the discussion, some committee members thought that producing spare parts involved uneven workloads among different processes, required a lot of effort, and would not increase the factory's output or revenue, which would affect the factory's reputation. To solve this ideological problem, the revolutionary committee and the stationed People's Liberation Army organized a study class on Mao Zedong Thought. They organized revolutionary workers to severely criticize the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents on the coal industry frontline who promoted the revisionist line of "profit as the commander" and "output as the commander," and criticized the factory's past mistakes of emphasizing main machinery over spare parts and manufacturing over maintenance in coal machinery production. The committee members generally realized that the relationship between main machinery and spare parts, and manufacturing and maintenance, is not a simple matter of who is primary and who is secondary. It is a major issue of whether the newly established revolutionary committee serves the overall interests of the state or only the interests of the unit. Socialist enterprises must consider the bigger picture and have a comprehensive perspective, firmly execute the tasks assigned by the state, and produce spare parts needed by coal mines.

Subsequently, the revolutionary committee organized representatives of revolutionary workers to visit and inspect coal mines, understand the situation of coal mines in promoting revolution and production, and solicit opinions from coal mines on the production of coal machinery. After returning, the representatives, together with all the workers in the factory, carried out revolutionary criticism to eliminate the influence of "output as the commander" and "profit as the commander." The broad masses of workers decided to overcome all difficulties and strive to produce spare parts.

Severely Criticizing "Business First," Promoting Production with Revolution

Through the criticism, the revolutionary and production situation in the entire factory continued to improve. At this time, some committee members and part of the masses focused on production without paying attention to the revolution. Some production teams, seeing that there were many new workers and apprentices who were not skilled, worked slowly, wanted to stop the Mao Zedong Thought study classes and set up technical study classes. The revolutionary committee and the stationed People's Liberation Army discovered these problems and promptly organized everyone to study Chairman Mao's great teachings on "political work being the lifeline of all economic work." They guided everyone to thoroughly find the reasons why production was not good in the past. The broad masses of revolutionary workers realized that the focus of the two-line struggle on the coal industry frontline has always been whether to emphasize proletarian politics or bourgeois politics. They said that in the past, the capitalist roaders emphasized "business as the commander" and "production first," which was to emphasize bourgeois politics and attempt to restore capitalism. If we do not grasp class struggle and promote production with revolution, production will go astray. They thoroughly criticized the revisionist black goods of "production first" and "business first" promoted by the capitalist roaders within the factory, greatly promoting the thought revolution of the people, and the production situation improved significantly. The deceleration machine workshop's heat treatment team, old worker Zhang Fu, came early and left late every day, working diligently. Due to the lack of lifting equipment, he personally carried thirty-plus kilogram parts onto and off the equipment, carrying five or six dozen parts each day. The forging workshop's part two team completed the production task ahead of schedule every month.

Severely Criticizing the "Expert Line," Promoting Technological Innovation

To produce spare parts quickly and well, the revolutionary committee followed Chairman Mao's teachings on "not breaking without establishing" and further used revolutionary criticism as the driving force for technological innovation and technological revolution. They mobilized the broad masses of revolutionary workers to severely criticize the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in the factory who promoted the revisionist black goods of "expert management."

In the past, a small clique of capitalist roaders in the Coal Machinery Factory allowed so-called technical "authorities" to seize the production and technical power of the entire factory. They did not start from reality but engaged in deception and sought fame and profit, producing only large and expensive items, wasting a lot of state resources. The revolutionary committee led the broad masses of revolutionary workers, following Chairman Mao's teachings on "having discoveries, inventions, creations, and progress," to thoroughly criticize the capitalist roaders and so-called technical "authorities," and launched a massive technological innovation and technological revolution movement across the factory.

The revolutionary workers in the machinery workshop's shaft three team, in front of the so-called technical "authorities," presented the urgently needed parts for the twenty-type transport machine of the coal mine, severely criticizing their past crimes of suppressing workers' technological innovation suggestions more than ten times, and immediately changed the two-time casting into one-time casting, ensuring quality and improving efficiency. The revolutionary workers in the casting workshop, after severely criticizing the revisionist line of "expert management," successfully developed the magnesium brick breaker, increasing production efficiency by five times. In May, they also realized the modification of the steel furnace. In the past, six or seven workers had to shovel materials in high temperatures for thirty minutes, but now, with electric control for material feeding, it only takes five or six minutes, reducing the smelting time by fifty minutes, improving the quality by 5%, and increasing the capacity by one fold.

Currently, the factory has implemented more than thirty innovation projects, which have played a significant role in reducing workers' labor intensity, improving product quality and production efficiency, and ensuring the overfulfillment of the state plan.

    张家口煤矿机械厂革委会发动职工狠批中国赫鲁晓夫
    革命大批判有力地推动大好形势的发展
    本报讯　张家口煤矿机械厂革命委员会，在驻厂解放军帮助下，发动广大革命职工狠抓阶级斗争，深入开展革命大批判，革命和生产形势大好，上半年已完成全年生产配件任务的百分之八十七。
    狠批“利润挂帅”，树立全局观点
    今年四月份，煤炭部召开了煤矿配件生产会议，提出了生产更多的配件的战斗任务。煤机厂革命委员会根据毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的指示，认真讨论了如何更好地完成任务的问题。在讨论中，个别委员认为搞配件生产，工序之间忙闲不均，费劲不小，产值产量都上不去，会影响工厂的声誉。革委会和驻厂解放军为了解决这个思想问题，举办了毛泽东思想学习班。他们组织革命职工狠批中国赫鲁晓夫及其在煤炭工业战线上的代理人推行的“利润挂帅”“产值挂帅”的修正主义办厂路线，批判了工厂过去在煤炭机械生产上重主机、轻配件和重制造、轻维修的错误做法。革委会成员普遍认识到：主机与配件、制造与维修，决不是简单的谁主谁次的问题，这是关系到新生的革命委员会是维护国家的整体利益还是只顾本单位利益的大问题。社会主义企业就要顾大局，识大体，坚决执行国家分配的任务，生产煤矿所需的配件。
    接着，革命委员会组织革命职工代表到煤矿参观访问，了解煤矿抓革命促生产的情况，征求煤矿对煤矿机械生产的意见。代表们回来后，又和全厂职工一起进行革命大批判，肃清“产值挂帅”“利润挂帅”的流毒。广大职工决心排除一切困难，努力生产配件。
    狠批“业务第一”，以革命带动生产
    通过大批判，全厂的革命和生产形势越来越好。这时，革委会个别委员和部分群众埋头搞生产，不注意抓革命。个别生产小组看到新工人多，徒工多，技术不熟练，干活不快，就想停办毛泽东思想学习班，办个技术学习班。革命委员会和驻厂解放军发现这些问题，及时组织大家学习毛主席关于“政治工作是一切经济工作的生命线”的伟大教导，并引导大家狠找过去生产搞不好的原因。广大革命职工认识到，煤炭工业战线上两条路线斗争的焦点，历来是突出无产阶级政治，还是突出资产阶级政治。他们说，过去走资派大搞“业务挂帅”“生产第一”，就是突出资产阶级政治，妄图复辟资本主义。我们如果不抓阶级斗争，不以革命带动生产，生产就会走到邪路上去。他们彻底批判了厂内走资派所推行“生产第一”“业务第一”的反革命修正主义黑货，大大促进了人的思想革命化，生产面貌一新。减速机车间热处理小组老工人张府，每天早来晚走，辛勤地工作。由于没有起重设备，他一个人把三十多公斤的零件往设备上抱上抱下，每天要抱五、六十个。锻工车间零件二组，月月超额完成生产任务。
                狠批“专家路线”，大搞技术革新
    为了又快又好地生产配件，革委会遵循毛主席关于“不破不立”的教导，进一步把革命大批判当作推动技术革新和技术革命的动力。他们发动广大革命职工狠批中国赫鲁晓夫及其在本厂代理人推行的“专家治厂”的修正主义黑货。
    过去，煤机厂的一小撮走资派让所谓技术“权威”窃据了全厂的生产、技术大权。他们不从实际出发，而是弄虚作假，图名图利，尽搞些又大又洋的东西，浪费了国家很多资财。革命委员会带领广大革命职工，遵循毛主席关于“有所发现，有所发明，有所创造，有所前进”的教导，大造走资派和所谓技术“权威”的反，在全厂掀起了轰轰烈烈的技术革新和技术革命的群众运动。
    机工车间轴三组的革命职工，当着所谓技术“权威”的面，拿出煤矿急需设备二十型运输机零件，狠批他们过去十几次扼杀工人有关技术革新建议的罪行，并当场把两次铸成改为一次铸成，保证了质量，提高了效率。铸工车间革命职工，在狠批“专家治厂”的修正主义路线以后，试制成功了镁砖捣破机，提高生产效率五倍。五月份，又实现了钢炉改修，过去六七个工人冒着高温用铁锹装料，需要三十分钟，现在采用电气控制装料，只需要五六分钟，熔炼时间比过去缩短五十分钟，质量提高百分之五，容量增大了一倍。
    现在，全厂已实现了三十多种革新项目，这对减轻工人劳动强度，提高产品质量和生产效率，保证国家计划的超额完成，起了重大作用。
