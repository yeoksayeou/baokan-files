The U.S. imperialists and the Soviet revisionists have recently accelerated their counter-revolutionary global collusion, attempting to obstruct the irresistible revolutionary movement of the world's people.

Following the series of dirty deals they made in June around the "prevention of nuclear proliferation" hoax, they have now signed a comprehensive "cultural exchange agreement" and officially begun using the New York-Moscow direct flight route. Meanwhile, they are once again using the "Geneva Seventeen-Nation Disarmament Conference" as a channel to further intensify their collusion on the so-called "disarmament" issue.

At the first meeting of the Seventeen-Nation "Disarmament Conference" held on July 16, U.S. representative Foster read a letter from U.S. imperialist leader Johnson to the conference. The Soviet revisionist representative Roshchin also presented a memorandum proposed by Soviet revisionist leader Khrushchev on July 1, titled "Urgent Measures for Stopping the Arms Race and Disarmament." They were in perfect harmony, collaborating closely.

The memorandum issued by the Soviet revisionist leadership is lengthy, containing nine points. It mainly advocates for so-called "nuclear disarmament," covering a wide range from underground to sky, from land to sea, encompassing everything. The purpose of the Soviet revisionist leadership in issuing such a memorandum is to use some deceptive "disarmament" rhetoric to lull the people of various countries into complacency in their struggle against U.S.-Soviet nuclear monopoly and nuclear blackmail. It also aims to conceal the essence of its surrender and betrayal policy on the "disarmament" issue, allowing it to more freely engage in deals with the U.S. imperialists.

As early as July 1, when Khrushchev first issued this memorandum, American newspapers and news agencies had already hinted that Khrushchev's "nine-point disarmament measures" were a mix of new and old proposals, and the U.S. believed there were some possibilities for exploration (Associated Press).

Johnson, who had long anticipated the next steps in the U.S.-Soviet collusion, also confirmed in his letter to the conference that the U.S. intends to negotiate with the Soviet revisionists on several items listed in the "memorandum." In his letter, he again praised the "prevention of nuclear proliferation" treaty co-concocted by the U.S. and the Soviet Union, saying it was a major step toward the goal the U.S. has long sought. He also encouraged the Soviet revisionist leadership to make more and bigger deals with the U.S. imperialists. He emphasized the issue of "stopping the strategic arms race," that is, the "limitation of missile competition," as well as "achieving regional restrictions on conventional weapons" and "sea-bed restrictions on weapons." These are precisely the items advocated by the Soviet revisionist leadership's "memorandum." Thus, the transaction lists of the U.S. and the Soviet Union completely matched.

Regarding the issue of "limiting the missile competition," after more than a year of preparation and planning by both sides, it was announced that formal talks would soon be held. This will be another major collusion between the U.S. and the Soviet Union on the so-called "nuclear disarmament" following the 1963 August partial nuclear test ban treaty signed by the U.S., the Soviet Union, and the UK, and the recently signed "prevention of nuclear proliferation" treaty. It is another serious step they have taken in forming an anti-China, anti-communist, anti-people, and counter-revolutionary nuclear military alliance.

The so-called "regional disarmament" mentioned by both the U.S. and the Soviet Union is a major conspiracy where they use "disarmament" as an excuse to play big-power politics, limiting other countries from developing self-defense weapons. In discussing "regional disarmament," the Soviet revisionist leadership's "memorandum" specifically mentioned the Middle East region, which is also in coordination with the U.S. On July 17, the day after Johnson's letter was read, a reporter for the U.S. Christian Science Monitor in Geneva revealed in a report that when Johnson mentioned "regional disarmament," he was primarily considering the Middle East. For some time, the U.S. has been secretly plotting with the Soviet revisionists to pressure the Arab peoples to submit to the aggression of the U.S. and Israel, accepting a so-called "political solution" to the Middle East issue that is favorable to the Israeli aggressors but unfavorable to the Arab peoples. The so-called stopping of the arms race in the Middle East is a component of this conspiracy. This conspiracy has been exposed and condemned by the Arab people and has not succeeded. Now, the U.S. and the Soviet revisionists are attempting to push it forward under the guise of "disarmament."

    一唱一和加紧反革命勾结　亦步亦趋大搞黑政治交易
    美苏在日内瓦“裁军”会议上演双簧
    一个宣读约翰逊信件鼓励苏修叛卖　一个抛出柯西金“备忘录”再向美帝献媚
    据新华社二十七日讯美帝、苏修最近大大加快了它们反革命全球勾结的步伐，妄图阻挠世界人民势不可挡的革命运动的发展。
    继六月份美苏环绕“防止核扩散”这个大骗局作成一桩又一桩的肮脏交易之后，紧接着，它们又在七月中旬签订了一项包罗万象的“文化交流协定”，并正式开始使用纽约—莫斯科直达航线。与此同时，它们再次利用“日内瓦十七国裁军会议”这条“渠道”，开始就所谓“裁军”问题进一步加紧勾结。
    在十六日举行的十七国“裁军会议”首次会议上，美国代表福斯特宣读了美帝头子约翰逊给会议的信件，苏修代表罗申也抛出了苏修头目柯西金七月一日提出的所谓“停止军备竞赛和裁军的紧急措施备忘录”，一呼一应，配合得十分紧密。
    苏修领导集团抛出的这份“备忘录”，洋洋洒洒共有九项之多，主要是鼓吹所谓“核裁军”问题，涉及的范围，从地下到天上，从陆地到海洋，包罗万象，一应俱全。苏修领导集团现在抛出这样一份“备忘录”，其目的是企图用一些欺人的“裁军”高调，来麻痹世界各国人民反对美苏核垄断、核讹诈的斗争意志，并掩盖它在“裁军”问题上所奉行的投降、叛卖路线的实质，以便于它更加放手地同美帝作交易。
    早在七月一日柯西金最初抛出这个“备忘录”时，美国报刊、通讯社就曾经心领神会地指出，柯西金“提出的九点裁军措施是一些新旧建议的混合物，美国认为其中存在着一些可以探索的可能性”
  （美联社）。
    对于美苏下一步勾结早已胸中有数的约翰逊，在他给会议的信件中也证明，美国打算就苏修“备忘录”中所开列的几个项目同苏修作交易。他在信中再次吹捧美苏合伙炮制的“防止核扩散”条约，说这是向美国“一直谋求的目标迈进的一大步”，并且鼓励苏修领导集团同美帝作成更多、更大的交易。他着重提到所谓“停止战略军备竞赛”问题，也就是“限制导弹竞赛”问题，同时也提到“实现对常规军备的区域性限制”和“海底限制军备”问题。这几个项目也正是苏修领导集团的“备忘录”所鼓吹的，这样，美苏两家的交易清单就完全对上了口径。
    关于“限制导弹竞赛”问题，经过双方一年多的酝酿策划，据宣布，即将正式举行会谈。这将是继一九六三年八月美苏英三国“部分禁止核试验”条约以及最近签订的“防止核扩散”条约之后，美苏在所谓“核裁军”方面的又一重大勾结，是它们在结成反华、反共、反人民、反革命核军事同盟方面所采取的又一严重步骤。
    美苏双方都提到的所谓“区域性裁军”，是它们企图以“裁军”为借口，再次玩弄大国强权政治，限制其它国家发展自卫武器的一个重大阴谋。苏修领导集团的“备忘录”在谈到“区域性裁军”时，特别提到了中东地区，这一点也是同美国协调一致的。七月十七日，即宣读约翰逊的信件的第二天，美国《基督教科学箴言报》驻日内瓦记者在报道中透露，约翰逊在提到
  “区域性裁军”时，考虑的也首先是中东。一个时期以来，美帝一直在同苏修密谋策划，企图压阿拉伯各国人民屈从美帝和以色列的侵略，接受一项有利于以色列侵略者而不利于阿拉伯各国人民的所谓中东问题的“政治解决”办法，而所谓停止中东地区的军备竞赛，就是这个阴谋计划中的一个组成部分。这个阴谋由于遭到阿拉伯人民的揭露和谴责，一直未能得逞，现在，美帝苏修又企图在“裁军”的幌子下来加以推行。
