Discipline Is the Guarantee of Implementing the Line
— Recording the Firm Execution of Orders and Model Adherence to Discipline by the North Sea Fleet's No. 82 Escort Vessel

Great Leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "The strength of this army lies in the fact that all those who join this army have a conscious sense of discipline." The North Sea Fleet of the People's Liberation Army Navy's No. 82 escort vessel is a combat collective with such conscious discipline. Especially since the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, they have consciously followed and firmly implemented all the directives, policies, orders, and instructions of the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin. Strong revolutionary organizational discipline ensures that they firmly implement Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and successfully complete all tasks in defending the coast and safeguarding the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Obey Orders Immediately and Stop When Prohibited

The No. 82 vessel is a warship that has been rated as one of the top four for seven consecutive years. It has always strictly adhered to revolutionary discipline and firmly executed orders, with all actions under command, obeying orders immediately and stopping when prohibited.

Last winter night, the entire crew of the No. 82 vessel was asleep. Suddenly, an order came from higher authorities: "Suspicious targets have been discovered in the X sea area. Order your vessel to set sail immediately and quickly investigate." The crew of the No. 82 vessel, who had cultivated a high sense of organizational discipline and a tight, united spirit, quickly prepared for battle, driving the warship through the wind and waves towards the designated sea area.

Shortly after leaving the port, a six to seven-level wind blew. Wave after wave, like small mountains, came crashing down on the warship. The small boat rocked up and down in the sea, rising and falling. The boat tilted to more than thirty degrees, and most of the comrades were seasick and vomiting. The comrades faced a severe test. They deeply realized that now they were carrying out the glorious task of safeguarding the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, going to sea to perform combat readiness duties, which was to implement Chairman Mao's important instructions on "grasp revolution, promote production, promote work, and promote combat readiness," and to execute the combat orders of the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin. No matter how strong the wind and waves, no matter how many difficulties, they must firmly execute the orders. They fought all night, overcame various difficulties, and successfully completed this mission.

Such combat readiness and duty tasks, all comrades of the No. 82 vessel, from officers to soldiers, fully understand their political significance and have always firmly executed them without compromise. They have a basic principle: for instructions from the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, they execute them firmly if they understand them, and they also execute them firmly if they do not understand them, deepening their understanding in the process of execution. They say: "Wherever Chairman Mao points, we will strike there!" "We must be like Comrade Li Wenzhong, following Chairman Mao's instructions and advancing as Chairman Mao waves his hand!"

Putting the Strengthening of Organizational Discipline on the Level of Line Struggle

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Discipline is the guarantee of implementing the line." The high revolutionary organizational discipline of this vessel comes from the high level of line struggle awareness of the officers and soldiers.

During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the party branch of this vessel vigorously promoted the education of the two-line struggle, deeply and persistently carried out revolutionary criticism, making all officers and soldiers of the vessel deeply love Chairman Mao, Mao Zedong Thought, and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and deeply hate the reactionary line of the Chinese Khrushchev, greatly enhancing their awareness of implementing and defending Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions.

The party branch regards the strengthening of revolutionary organizational discipline education as an important part of the two-line struggle education, often educating everyone to recognize the issue of consciously adhering to revolutionary discipline from the height of line struggle, regarding revolutionary nature, scientific nature, and organizational discipline as the standard for measuring the level of line struggle awareness. During the process of organizing everyone to study Chairman Mao's theory, line, policy, and principles of continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat, the party branch also organized everyone to study Chairman Mao's teachings on strengthening organizational discipline and Vice Chairman Lin's related instructions, making everyone deeply understand Chairman Mao's teachings: "Without discipline, the party cannot lead the masses and the army to fight a victorious battle." Through study, comrades deeply realized that in the fierce and complex struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines, to complete the glorious tasks given by Chairman Mao to our army, to implement and defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, we must, while improving revolutionary nature and scientific nature, further strengthen organizational discipline. Comrades say: "The class enemy is afraid of our army's high organizational discipline. They try every means to destroy our army's organizational discipline and attempt to weaken our army's combat effectiveness. We must not be fooled." Comrades all regard consciously insisting on revolutionary nature, scientific nature, and organizational discipline as their fundamental attitude towards Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and an important sign of loyalty to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Whether in front of the leadership or far from the leadership; whether in collective action or individual action; whether the vessel is docked at the pier or sailing in the sea, they all consciously and strictly act according to the party's policies, the leadership's instructions, orders, and regulations, without any discount or bargaining. Once, the No. 82 vessel executed a mission at sea according to the higher authorities' orders. Suddenly, a six-level wind blew, and their standby point was right at the wind's mouth, with big waves and strong currents. A gust of wind and waves would blow the small boat dozens of meters away. To maintain the boat's position, they encountered great difficulties. Under normal circumstances, they could anchor in place, which would greatly reduce the boat's sway and maintain the boat's position. However, at that time, all comrades on the vessel had a common thought: to achieve immediate deployment upon a single order, the higher authorities ordered us to drift and wait here, we must not anchor and wait, and we must firmly execute the order without any deviation. In the wind and waves, they loudly read Chairman Mao's quotations: "With firm determination, fearing no sacrifice, overcoming all difficulties, and striving for victory." They overcame numerous difficulties, achieved drifting and waiting, and also tried their best to maintain the accurate boat position, successfully completing the mission.

Only by Criticizing Bourgeois Thought Can the Proletarian Organizational Discipline Be Firmly Established

Great Leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "The correct political and military lines are not naturally and peacefully produced and developed, but are produced and developed through struggle." The comrades of the No. 82 vessel deeply realized through their own practice that conscious, high-level revolutionary organizational discipline is strengthened in struggle, in the great criticism of bourgeois thought.

Since the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the party branch of the No. 82 vessel has used Chairman Mao's proletarian military thought and Vice Chairman Lin's series of principles and policies based on Chairman Mao's military thought as weapons, deeply criticizing the reactionary bourgeois military line of the counter-revolutionary revisionist Peng Dehuai and Luo Ruiqing, severely criticizing their military feudalism and soldier-fooling policy, greatly inspiring the revolutionary spirit of officers and soldiers.

As the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution deepened, the party branch also organized all comrades on the vessel to use large and small meetings, blackboard newspapers, and wall newspapers to carry out mass revolutionary criticism against the reactionary fallacies of "doubt everything" spread by the Chinese Khrushchev. Some comrades exposed the harm caused by the anarchist thoughts spread by the Chinese Khrushchev. Through revolutionary criticism, comrades realized that the Chinese Khrushchev and the counter-revolutionary revisionists Peng Dehuai and Luo Ruiqing, whether they spread anarchism or practiced military feudalism and soldier-fooling policy, both are for the same purpose: to usurp the military and the party, to damage the proletarian revolutionary authority, to disperse the revolutionary organization, to relax revolutionary discipline, to split the revolutionary ranks, to weaken revolutionary forces, and ultimately to sabotage the entire revolution. Everyone said: Chairman Mao is our supreme commander. For all orders and instructions from the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, we must follow them word for word and execute them firmly, executing them if we understand them and executing them firmly if we do not understand them, and we must not regard the execution of proletarian revolutionary organizational discipline as "slavery" to oppose.

In the revolutionary criticism, the party branch also organized officers and soldiers to link the actual situation, repeatedly study Chairman Mao's teachings on the relationship between democracy and centralization, freedom and discipline, further eliminating the poison of anarchism, military feudalism, and soldier-fooling policy spread by the Chinese Khrushchev and Peng Dehuai, Luo Ruiqing, further enhancing the officers' and soldiers' awareness of adhering to discipline, and improving the officers' level of leading the army with Mao Zedong Thought. Comrades deeply realized that "among the people, there must be no freedom without discipline, and no democracy without discipline; there must be no democracy without centralization, and no freedom without discipline. This unity of democracy and centralization, freedom and discipline, is our democratic centralism. Under this system, the people enjoy extensive democracy and freedom; at the same time, they must also be constrained by socialist discipline"; realized that our People's Liberation Army is "an armed group executing revolutionary political tasks," and to complete the great mission given by the supreme commander Chairman Mao to defend the country and safeguard the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we must have both high proletarian revolutionary nature and high revolutionary organizational discipline awareness, consciously adhering to revolutionary discipline. Comrades expressed that they would definitely follow Chairman Mao's teachings, "must strengthen discipline, firmly execute orders, implement policies, implement the three major disciplines and eight points for attention, ... not allowing any phenomenon of violating discipline to exist."

Through revolutionary criticism, the officers' and soldiers' awareness of line struggle improved, and their revolutionary enthusiasm and creativity increased. The three major democracies were further promoted, and the relationship between officers and soldiers became more harmonious. At the same time, organizational discipline was continuously strengthened, with everyone emphasizing discipline and everywhere emphasizing discipline; good deeds were praised by someone, and bad deeds were criticized by someone; obeying orders immediately and stopping when prohibited. During combat readiness duty, no matter how urgent the situation was, no one left the vessel on their own. Sometimes during combat readiness duty, they encountered movie screenings, only about two hundred meters away from the vessel, and no one went ashore to watch. Old soldier Ning Zhiqui, when returning to the unit after visiting his family, encountered continuous rain, and the flood destroyed the road, making the car unable to pass. Villagers all advised him to wait until the car could pass before returning to the unit. However, Ning Zhiqui thought of Chairman Mao's teachings on "strengthening discipline, revolution is invincible" and his sacred duty to safeguard the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and resolutely returned to the unit on time despite the wind and rain.

In Actual Struggle, Continuously Cultivating the Army's Awareness of Executing Discipline

Vice Chairman Lin instructed us: "... apart from political and military education in peacetime, the cultivation of the army's excellent combat style mainly relies on actual training." In recent years, the party branch of the No. 82 vessel has followed Vice Chairman Lin's instructions, on the one hand, caring for and loving the soldiers politically, ideologically, and in life, promoting democratic style, going deep into the masses, closely linking with the masses, and humbly listening to the masses' criticisms and suggestions, on the other hand, strictly demanding in daily work, military training, and combat readiness, cultivating the army's awareness of adhering to discipline and firmly executing orders.

One evening, the No. 82 vessel set sail four times consecutively. The party branch regarded this as an opportunity to cultivate and temper the army's firm execution of orders and conscious adherence to discipline. That day, the No. 82 vessel conducted a day of sea training and returned to the pier at around 6:30 PM. Everyone was having dinner when the higher authorities notified them to set sail for an emergency mission. Upon the order, comrades quickly rushed to their battle positions. They said: "Executing orders cannot be delayed by a single second." When they returned to the pier victoriously, another emergency mission came. Obeying orders immediately, the crew of the No. 82 vessel did not leave their battle positions and completed the mission again. This time, they returned after midnight. The unit leaders cared for them and let them rest well. However, they still firmly requested to participate in the originally scheduled night sea exercise. They said: "This is exactly the time to test and temper ourselves. The more it is in such a situation, the more we must strictly demand of ourselves." Wireless operator Yin Jiandong, who was severely seasick and vomiting, also insisted on participating and did not want to miss this "combat" opportunity. Thus, the comrades of the No. 82 vessel completed the third mission. Due to the needs of the mission, they accepted the fourth mission after returning from the third mission. An alarm pierced the night sky before dawn. The crew of the No. 82 vessel loudly read Chairman Mao's teachings on "developing the style of bravely fighting, fearing no sacrifice, fearing no fatigue, and continuous combat (i.e., fighting several battles in a short period without rest)" and set sail from the port, starting a new battle.

Afterward, the party branch organized everyone to actively learn and apply Chairman Mao's teachings on strengthening organizational discipline and Vice Chairman Lin's instructions, summarizing the experience of executing four missions consecutively. Comrades said: Only by being infinitely loyal to Great Leader Chairman Mao and highlighting proletarian politics can we, in any harsh environment, consciously and unshakably execute revolutionary discipline.

Vice Chairman Lin said: "The army with good style can also become good when new elements enter." The matter is exactly like this. New communications soldier Liu Yongjun, under the influence of old soldiers, strictly demanded of himself and dared to temper himself. In a night exercise, when the command post issued the order for light control, Liu Yongjun was already severely seasick. Closing the door tightly made him even more breathless. At this moment, due to the severe rocking of the boat, two bottles of carbon dioxide liquid placed in the room were knocked over and broken, and the pungent smell made him even more uncomfortable. Liu Yongjun really wanted to open the door to let in some air, but he thought that now it was "in battle," and light control was the order from the higher authorities, which must not be violated. Usually, it should be like in battle; no matter how difficult, the order must be firmly executed, and the mission must be completed. Thus, he persisted until the exercise ended.

In cultivating and tempering the army's organizational discipline and style, the officers of the No. 82 vessel seriously performed their duties. They insisted on using good political and ideological work to promote and lead the "three-eights" style, firmly believing in the masses and relying on the masses, thereby strengthening the masses' awareness of consciously adhering to revolutionary organizational discipline. They led by example, dared to manage, and were good at managing. Former captain Zhang Lianzheng was called a good captain who "loves deeply and manages strictly" by everyone. His model role was good, and in daily life, he cultivated the soldiers' awareness of consciously adhering to revolutionary discipline in every aspect. Once, a soldier did not dress according to regulations when lining up to enter the canteen. Zhang Lianzheng found out and immediately criticized him. After the meal, he talked to this soldier, explaining the importance of cultivating conscious adherence to revolutionary discipline in every action according to Chairman Mao's teachings, which educated this soldier greatly.

The comrades of the No. 82 vessel are like this. Whether in tense combat readiness duty or in daily life, they always cultivate the army's awareness of consciously adhering to revolutionary discipline through one person and one event.

"Strengthen discipline, and revolution is invincible."

### 纪律是执行路线的保证——记坚决执行命令、模范遵守纪律的北海舰队八二号护卫艇

专栏：

    纪律是执行路线的保证
    ——记坚决执行命令、模范遵守纪律的北海舰队八二号护卫艇
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“这个军队之所以有力量，是因为所有参加这个军队的人，都具有自觉的纪律”。人民解放军海军北海舰队八二号护卫艇，就是一个具有这种自觉纪律的战斗集体。特别是无产阶级文化大革命以来，他们对以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的一切方针、政策、命令、指示，更是自觉紧跟，坚决照办。坚强的革命的组织纪律性，保证他们坚决贯彻执行毛主席的革命路线，在保卫海防、保卫无产阶级文化大革命中，圆满地完成了各项任务。
      有令即行，有禁即止
    八二号艇是一艘连续七年被评为四好的战艇，一向严格遵守革命纪律，坚决执行命令，一切行动听指挥，有令即行，有禁即止。
    去年冬天的一个夜晚，八二号艇的全体指战员正在熟睡。突然传来了上级指示：“××海区发现可疑目标，命令你艇立即出航，迅速查明。”平时就养成了高度组织纪律观念和团结紧张作风的八二号艇的指战员们，很快做好了战斗准备，驾驶着战艇，乘风破浪，奔向指定海区。
    出港不久，海上就刮起了六七级大风。一个个的浪头象小山一样，接二连三地向战艇扑来。小艇在大海里上上下下，起伏不定。艇摇晃到三十多度，大部分同志晕船呕吐了。指战员们面临着一场严峻的考验。他们深深意识到：现在担负着保卫无产阶级文化大革命的光荣任务，出海执行战备任务，就是落实毛主席关于“抓革命，促生产，促工作，促战备”的重要指示，就是执行以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的战斗命令。风浪再大，困难再多，也要坚决执行命令。他们苦战一整夜，战胜了种种困难，出色地完成了这次任务。
    象这样的战备执勤任务，八二号艇的全体同志，从干部到战士，都非常懂得它的政治意义，从来都是坚决执行，一丝不苟。他们有一条基本原则，对于来自以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的指示，理解的坚决执行，不理解的也坚决执行，在执行中加深理解。他们说：“毛主席指到那，我们就打到那！”“我们就是要象李文忠同志那样，毛主席指示我照办，毛主席挥手我前进。”
      把加强组织纪律性，提到路线斗争
    的高度来认识
    毛主席教导我们：“纪律是执行路线的保证”。这个艇的高度的革命组织纪律性，来源于干部战士的高度的路线斗争觉悟。
    在无产阶级文化大革命运动中，这个艇的党支部，狠抓了两条路线斗争教育，深入持久地开展了革命大批判，使全艇干部战士对毛主席、毛泽东思想和毛主席的无产阶级革命路线无比热爱，对中国赫鲁晓夫的资产阶级反动路线刻骨仇恨，大大提高了执行和捍卫毛主席的革命路线，落实毛主席最新指示的自觉性。
    党支部把加强革命的组织纪律性教育作为两条路线斗争教育的重要组成部分，经常教育大家从路线斗争的高度来认识自觉遵守革命纪律的问题，把革命性、科学性和组织纪律性，作为衡量路线斗争觉悟高低的标志。党支部在组织大家学习毛主席关于无产阶级专政条件下继续进行革命的理论、路线、方针和政策的过程中，还组织大家学习毛主席关于加强组织纪律性的教导，学习林副主席的有关指示，使大家深刻理解毛主席的教导：“没有纪律，党就无法率领群众与军队进行胜利的斗争。”通过学习，同志们深刻认识到：在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的尖锐复杂的斗争中，要完成毛主席交给我军的光荣任务，要执行和捍卫毛主席的革命路线，就必须在提高革命性、科学性的同时，进一步加强组织纪律性。同志们说：“阶级敌人就是害怕我军高度的组织纪律性，他们千方百计地想要破坏我军的组织纪律性，企图削弱我军的战斗力，我们绝对不能上当。”同志们都把自觉地坚持革命性、科学性和组织纪律性，看成是对毛主席革命路线的根本态度，看成是忠于毛主席革命路线的重要标志。不论是近在领导跟前，还是远离领导；是集体行动，还是个人行动；是艇只靠在码头，还是在大海中航行，他们都自觉地严格地按照党的方针、政策和上级的指示、命令、规定办事，不打折扣，不讲价钱。有一次，八二号艇按照上级的命令在海上执行任务。突然间，刮起了六级大风，他们的待机点又正在风口处，浪大，流急，一阵风浪过来，小艇就被打出几十米远。要保持好艇位，遇到了很大困难。按照通常情况，他们本可以原地抛锚，这样既可以大大减少艇的摇摆度，又能保持好艇位。但是，当时全艇同志有一个共同想法：为了做到一声令下，立即出动，上级叫我们在这里漂泊待机，我们决不能锚泊待机，必须坚决不走样地执行命令。在风浪里，他们高声朗读着毛主席语录：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”克服了重重困难，做到了漂泊待机，而且想尽办法保持了准确的艇位，圆满地完成了任务。
      只有批判资产阶级思想，才能牢固
    地树立无产阶级的组织纪律观念
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“正确的政治的和军事的路线，不是自然地平安地产生和发展起来的，而是从斗争中产生和发展起来的。”八二号艇的同志们从自己的实践中深刻认识到：自觉的高度的革命组织纪律观念，是在斗争中，是在对资产阶级思想的大批判中进一步加强起来的。
    无产阶级文化大革命以来，八二号艇党支部以毛主席的无产阶级建军思想和林副主席根据毛主席的建军思想提出的一系列着重政治建军的方针原则为武器，深入批判了反革命修正主义分子彭德怀、罗瑞卿的反动的资产阶级军事路线，狠批了他们推行的军阀主义、愚兵政策，大大激发了干部战士的无产阶级革命精神。
    随着无产阶级文化大革命的深入发展，党支部还组织全艇同志运用大会小会、黑板报、墙报等形式，对中国赫鲁晓夫“怀疑一切”的反动谬论，展开了群众性的革命大批判。有的同志控诉了中国赫鲁晓夫散布无政府主义思想对自己的毒害。通过革命大批判，同志们认识到，中国赫鲁晓夫以及反革命修正主义分子彭德怀、罗瑞卿，不管他们是散布无政府主义，还是大搞军阀主义、愚兵政策，两种货色，一个用场，都是为了篡军反党，为了损害无产阶级的革命权威，涣散革命组织，松懈革命纪律，分裂革命队伍，削弱革命力量，最后破坏整个革命。大家说：毛主席是我们的最高统帅。对以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的一切号令、指示，就是要句句照办，坚决执行，理解的执行，不理解的也要坚决执行，决不能把执行无产阶级的革命组织纪律当作“奴隶主义”来反对。
    在革命大批判中，党支部还组织干部战士联系实际，反复学习毛主席有关民主与集中、自由与纪律的关系的教导，进一步肃清了中国赫鲁晓夫和彭德怀、罗瑞卿所散布的无政府主义、军阀主义和愚兵政策的流毒，进一步增强了干部战士遵守纪律的自觉性，提高了干部用毛泽东思想带兵的水平。同志们深刻认识到，“在人民内部，不可以没有自由，也不可以没有纪律；不可以没有民主，也不可以没有集中。这种民主和集中的统一，自由和纪律的统一，就是我们的民主集中制。在这个制度下，人民享受着广泛的民主和自由；同时又必须用社会主义的纪律约束自己”；认识到我们人民解放军是“执行革命的政治任务的武装集团”，为了完成伟大统帅毛主席交给我们保卫国防、保卫无产阶级文化大革命的历史使命，我们必须既有高度的无产阶级革命性，又有高度的革命组织纪律观念，自觉地遵守革命的纪律。同志们表示，一定要遵照毛主席的教导，“必须提高纪律性，坚决执行命令，执行政策，执行三大纪律八项注意，……不允许任何破坏纪律的现象存在。”
    通过革命大批判，干部战士的路线斗争觉悟提高了，革命的积极性、创造性提高了，三大民主得到进一步发扬，官兵关系更加融洽。同时组织纪律性也得到不断加强，人人讲纪律，处处讲纪律；好事有人夸，坏事有人抓；有令即行，有禁即止。担任战备值班时，不管情况紧急不紧急，没有一个人擅自离艇。有时在战备值班时碰到放映电影，离艇不过二百多米远，也没有一个人上岸去看。老战士宁志奎探家归队时，大雨下个不停，洪水冲坏了公路，汽车不通。乡亲们都劝他等汽车通了再归队。但是，宁志奎想起毛主席关于“加强纪律性，革命无不胜”的教导，想起了自己保卫无产阶级文化大革命的神圣职责，毅然决然地顶风冒雨按时回到了部队。
      在实际斗争中，不断培养部队执行
    纪律的自觉性
    林副主席指示我们：“……除了平时的政治教育和军事教育外，培养部队优良的战斗作风，最主要的是靠实际锻炼。”几年来，八二号艇党支部遵照林副主席的指示，一方面从政治上、思想上、生活上关心体贴爱护战士，发扬民主作风，深入群众，密切联系群众，虚心听取群众的批评和建议，另一方面在日常工作、军事训练、战备执勤中，时时处处严格要求，培养部队遵守纪律、坚决执行命令的自觉性。
    有一个晚上，八二号艇连续四次出航，党支部把这当作培养和锻炼部队坚决执行命令，自觉遵守纪律的好机会。这天，八二号艇进行了一天的海上训练，靠好码头时，已经是下午六点多钟了。大家正在吃晚饭，上级通知他们出航执行紧急任务。一声令下，同志们迅速奔上战位。他们说：“执行命令不能耽误一分一秒。”当他们胜利返回码头，又来了紧急任务。有令即行，八二号艇指战员没有下战位，又一次完成了任务。这次出航回来，已是深夜十一点多了。部队首长关怀地让他们好好休息。可是他们仍坚决要求参加原定的海上夜间演习。他们说：“这正是考验和锻炼我们的时候，越是在这种情况下，越是要严格要求自己。”无线电兵殷建东，晕船呕吐很厉害，也坚持要求参加，不肯丢掉这次“作战”机会。就这样，八二号艇的同志们完成了第三次出航任务。由于任务的需要，他们在第三次出航归来后，又接受了第四次出航任务。一声警报，划破了黎明前的夜空。八二号艇的指战员高声朗读着毛主席“发扬勇敢战斗、不怕牺牲、不怕疲劳和连续作战（即在短期内不休息地接连打几仗）的作风”的教导，驶出了港口，开始了新的战斗。
    事后，党支部组织大家活学活用毛主席有关加强组织纪律性的教导和林副主席的指示，总结连续四次执行任务的经验。同志们说：只有无限忠于伟大领袖毛主席，突出无产阶级政治，才能在任何艰苦环境里，自觉地、毫不动摇地执行革命纪律。
    林副主席说：“那个部队作风好，新成分进去也能变好。”事情正是这样。新报务员刘永军，在老战士的带动下，严格要求自己，敢于锻炼自己。在一次夜间演习中，艇体摇摆到三十多度，当指挥所下达灯火管制的演习命令时，刘永军本来晕船已经很严重了，再把门关得紧紧的，更是闷得喘不过气来。也就在这个时候，由于艇晃得厉害，放在室内的两瓶四氧化碳液体，被晃在地下打碎了，刺鼻的臭味使他更加难受。刘永军真想打开门通一下风，但他想到现在是在“作战”，灯火管制是上级的命令，决不能违背。平时要象战时一样，困难再大也要坚决执行命令，完成任务。于是他顽强地坚持着，一直到演习结束。
    在培养和锻炼部队的组织纪律性和作风方面，八二号艇的干部认真履行自己的职责。他们坚持以政治思想好来促进和带动三八作风好，坚决相信群众，依靠群众，从而加强了群众遵守革命组织纪律的自觉性。他们以身作则，敢于管理，善于管理。前任艇长张连仲，被大家称为对战士“爱得深、管得严”的好艇长。他的模范作用好，在日常生活中处处培养战士遵守革命纪律的自觉性。有一次，一个战士在列队进入食堂时，没有按规定着装。张连仲发现后，立即提出了批评。饭后，他又找这个战士谈心，按照毛主席的教导，讲清平时一举一动养成自觉遵守革命纪律的重要性，使这个战士很受教育。
    八二号艇的同志们就是这样无论在紧张的战备值勤中，还是在日常生活中，总是通过一人一事，扎扎实实地培养部队遵守革命纪律的自觉性。
      “加强纪律性，革命无不胜”。
