All revolutionary workers in the Shandong Postal and Telecommunications System, filled with profound proletarian feelings of boundless love for the great leader Chairman Mao, have made the prompt transmission of Chairman Mao's latest instructions and the distribution and delivery of Chairman Mao's revolutionary books their primary task. Every bureau has become a propaganda station for Mao Zedong Thought, and everyone strives to be a propagandist of Mao Zedong Thought. They have made significant contributions to the deepening of the mass movement to study and apply Mao Zedong Thought in the rural areas of the entire province.

Currently, all 132 municipal, prefectural, and county postal and telecommunications bureaus in the province, along with over 2,000 sub-bureaus and stations, have established reading stands for Chairman Mao's works and special counters for the distribution of Chairman Mao's revolutionary books. Many bureaus have also set up amateur Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams.

In the vast rural areas, postal workers generally carry boxes of Chairman Mao's revolutionary books on their bicycles. They propagate Chairman Mao's instructions wherever they go, deliver Chairman Mao's revolutionary books wherever they go, and distribute them wherever they go. They are not only postal workers but also distributors of Chairman Mao's works and guides for studying Chairman Mao's works. They have been warmly welcomed by the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants.

The new achievements of the revolutionary workers in the Shandong Postal and Telecommunications System in propagating Mao Zedong Thought and distributing Chairman Mao's revolutionary books were made in the midst of the intense class struggle and the struggle between the two lines during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. In the past, the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in the postal and telecommunications system promoted a whole set of counter-revolutionary revisionist goods, spreading the theory of the "extinction of class struggle," advocating "material incentives" and "business first," and establishing many rigid rules in postal and telecommunications work. They fiercely opposed and resisted the broad revolutionary workers from studying and applying Chairman Mao's works and emphasizing proletarian politics.

Chairman Mao taught us: "Without destruction, there can be no construction. Destruction means criticism, means revolution." During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the revolutionary workers in the Shandong Postal and Telecommunications System, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, rebelled against the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party. After the revolutionary masses of the proletariat seized power, they placed the study and application of Chairman Mao's works at the forefront of all work. They followed Chairman Mao's great teaching of "never forgetting class struggle," vigorously carried out class struggle and the struggle between the two lines, and continuously conducted revolutionary criticism and struggle. They thoroughly exposed and criticized the heinous crimes of the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in the postal and telecommunications system in attempting to restore capitalism, smashed old ideas and systems, and brought about profound changes in their spiritual outlook. They realized that studying, implementing, propagating, and defending Mao Zedong Thought is the sacred duty of every revolutionary worker. Our postal and telecommunications institutions are important tools of the dictatorship of the proletariat and must place the study and propagation of Mao Zedong Thought and the distribution of Chairman Mao's revolutionary books at the forefront of all work.

The revolutionary workers in the Shandong Postal and Telecommunications System have carried forward the revolutionary spirit of "seizing the day," traversing mountains and rivers, and walking through streets and alleys. They often go deep into the fields and farmlands, delivering Chairman Mao's works directly into the hands of the revolutionary masses. They promptly transmit Chairman Mao's latest instructions as soon as they hear them. After the great leader Chairman Mao issued his latest instruction that "whether to protect or suppress the broad masses of the people is the fundamental difference between the Communist Party and the Kuomintang, the fundamental difference between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, and the fundamental difference between the dictatorship of the proletariat and the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie," many postal workers, upon receiving newspapers carrying this latest instruction, worked day and night to quickly deliver them to the communes and production brigades.

In the process of distributing Chairman Mao's revolutionary books and transmitting Chairman Mao's latest instructions, the revolutionary postal workers also assisted the production teams in holding Mao Zedong Thought study classes, together with the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, carrying out revolutionary criticism and struggle, exposing and criticizing the heinous crimes of the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in obstructing and suppressing the publication and distribution of Chairman Mao's works. This made the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants even more hateful towards the Chinese Khrushchev and even more loving towards the great leader Chairman Mao. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants excitedly said: "Chairman Mao is our savior, the brightest red sun in our hearts. We will forever follow Chairman Mao's words, even if the sea dries up and the stones crumble, our hearts will never change!"

    山东邮电系统广大革命职工人人争当毛泽东思想宣传员
    争分夺秒宣传毛主席的最新指示
    披星戴月发行毛主席的光辉著作
    据新华社济南一日电山东邮电系统广大革命职工怀着对伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱的深厚无产阶级感情，把争分夺秒传递毛主席最新指示，发行、投递毛主席革命宝书作为邮电通信工作的首要任务，局局成为毛泽东思想宣传站，人人争当毛泽东思想宣传员，为推动全省农村广大贫下中农活学活用毛泽东思想群众运动的深入开展作出了贡献。
    现在，全省一百三十二个市、专、县的邮电局和两千多个支局、所，都普遍设立了毛主席著作阅读台和毛主席革命宝书发行专柜，不少局还建立了业余的毛泽东思想宣传队。
    广大农村投递员，一般都在自行车上带有毛主席革命宝书箱，走到哪里，就把毛主席指示宣传到哪里，把毛主席的革命宝书带到哪里，发行到哪里。他们既是投递员，又是毛主席著作发行员和学习毛主席著作的辅导员，受到了广大贫下中农的热烈欢迎。
    山东邮电系统革命职工在宣传毛泽东思想、发行毛主席革命宝书方面的新成就，是在无产阶级文化大革命激烈的阶级斗争和两条路线斗争中取得的。过去，中国赫鲁晓夫及其在邮电系统的代理人，推行了一整套反革命修正主义黑货，大肆散布“阶级斗争熄灭”论，大搞“物质刺激”、“业务挂帅”，在邮电通信中制定了许多清规戒律，疯狂地反对和抵制广大革命职工活学活用毛主席著作和突出无产阶级政治。
    毛主席教导说：“不破不立。破，就是批判，就是革命。”在无产阶级文化大革命中，山东邮电系统广大革命职工，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，造了党内一小撮走资派的反。广大无产阶级革命派掌权后，把活学活用毛主席著作放到了一切工作的首位。他们遵照毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的伟大教导，狠抓阶级斗争和两条路线斗争，持续不断地开展革命大批判，狠狠地揭露和批判了中国赫鲁晓夫及其在邮电系统代理人妄图复辟资本主义的滔天罪行，大破旧思想旧制度，精神面貌发生了深刻的变化。他们认识到，学习、执行、宣传和捍卫毛泽东思想，是每个革命职工的神圣职责。我们的邮电通信机构是无产阶级专政的重要工具之一，必须把学习和宣传毛泽东思想、发行毛主席革命宝书，放在一切工作的首位。
    山东省邮电系统广大革命职工发扬“只争朝夕”的革命精神，跋山涉水，穿街走巷，并且经常深入到田间、地头，把毛主席著作直接送到广大革命群众手中。他们对毛主席的最新指示更是闻风而动，迅速传递。伟大领袖毛主席的“对广大人民群众是保护还是镇压，是共产党同国民党的根本区别，是无产阶级同资产阶级的根本区别，是无产阶级专政同资产阶级专政的根本区别”的最新指示发表后，许多邮局的革命职工一接到刊载这一最新指示的报纸，就披星戴月，火速地传送到了公社和大队。在发行毛主席的革命宝书和传递毛主席最新指示的过程中，广大革命投递员还协助生产队举办毛泽东思想学习班，同广大贫下中农一起开展革命的大批判，揭露和批判中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人阻挠、压制出版和发行毛主席著作的滔天罪行，使广大贫下中农更加仇恨中国赫鲁晓夫，更加热爱伟大领袖毛主席。广大贫下中农激动地说：“毛主席是俺穷人的大救星，是俺心中最红最红的红太阳，俺要永远听毛主席的话，海枯石烂不变心！”
