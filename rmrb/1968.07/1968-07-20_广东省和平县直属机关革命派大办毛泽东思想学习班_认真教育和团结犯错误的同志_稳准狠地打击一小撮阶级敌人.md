In the course of cleaning up the class ranks, the proletarian revolutionary faction of the directly affiliated organs of Ping County, Guangdong Province, has held extensive Mao Zedong Thought study classes. They have done meticulous ideological and political work among those who have made mistakes, demanding high standards from them while also paying attention to uniting with them. This has helped them stand on the side of the revolutionary masses, thereby foiling the class enemy's plot to split and disintegrate the revolutionary ranks.

	Don't Let Those Who Have Made Mistakes
	Be Drawn Over by the Enemy

In the earlier phase of cleaning up the class ranks, the directly affiliated organs of Ping County, following the great leader Chairman Mao's instructions on strictly distinguishing between two types of contradictions, paid attention to winning over and uniting with cadres who had made mistakes. Under the influence of the Party's policies, many of these cadres came to their senses and voluntarily exposed the crimes of the class enemies. This made a small handful of class enemies tremble with fear and seethe with hatred. They resorted to various tricks, using threats and inducements, soft and hard tactics, in an attempt to draw over those who had made mistakes. In this situation, a few of those who had made mistakes began to waver, hesitate, and harbor doubts. Meanwhile, some revolutionary masses failed to promptly see through this new plot of the class enemies and showed impatience towards some of those who had made mistakes, relaxing their educational efforts towards them.

This problem quickly caught the attention of the supporting leftist military comrades. Together with the members of the county revolutionary committee, they analyzed the problem and unanimously agreed that this was a fierce struggle to win over the masses. To foil the class enemies' new plot, the supporting leftist personnel and the county revolutionary committee immediately organized the broad masses of cadres and revolutionary masses in the organs to study Chairman Mao's directives on the struggle against the enemy, the strict distinction between two types of contradictions, and the correct attitude towards comrades who have made mistakes. They guided everyone to recognize the new situation, new characteristics, and new trends of the class struggle. Everyone saw through the class enemies' new tricks and angrily declared, "The more the enemy fears our unity with those who have made mistakes, the more we must unite with all possible forces to jointly fight the enemy, and steadily, accurately, and fiercely strike at the small handful of class enemies. We will not let a single class brother who has made mistakes be drawn over by the enemy!"

	Strictly Distinguish Between Two Types of Contradictions

Next, the supporting leftist personnel and the county revolutionary committee helped the directly affiliated organs hold extensive Mao Zedong Thought study classes. They guided the proletarian revolutionary faction and the broad revolutionary masses to seriously do the ideological and political work of educating, winning over, and uniting with those who have made mistakes. They followed Chairman Mao's instructions: "Regarding those party members and cadres who have made mistakes but can still be educated, and those who are beyond redemption, regardless of their origins, they should all be educated and not abandoned." They paid attention to investigation and research, thoroughly understanding the entire history of those who have made mistakes, as well as their performance during the Cultural Revolution. They conducted a class analysis of the mistakes they made, strictly distinguishing between two types of contradictions. One cadre in a certain organ was originally a leader of a mass organization. He was deceived by the capitalist roaders within the Party and did many bad things. After the class enemies were exposed, some masses wanted to criticize and struggle against him in the same way as the bad elements. In the study class, everyone conducted a class analysis of this cadre's entire history and consistent performance, concluding that he was still a good person who made mistakes and should be helped and won over using the method of "unity—criticism and self-criticism—unity." Thus, everyone actively united with him, gave him warm help, encouraged him to put down his burden, examine his mistakes, and expose the enemy. Under the influence of the Party's policies, this cadre quickly stood on the side of the revolutionary masses and exposed a large number of crimes committed by the class enemies. The masses followed the clues he provided, tracked down and exposed a Kuomintang spy who had been hiding for many years. He also used his own experience of being deceived and making mistakes to speak to the masses, exposing and denouncing the heinous crimes of a small handful of class enemies. Some deceived masses, influenced by him, dispelled their doubts and bravely joined the struggle against the enemy.

	Combine Strict Demands with Patient Help

In the study class, some who had made serious mistakes did not have a deep understanding of their mistakes and did not examine them thoroughly. Some advocated applying more "pressure" to them. Facing this situation, the revolutionary committee and the supporting leftist personnel guided everyone to combine strict demands with patient help. Through meticulous ideological and political work, some who had made mistakes voluntarily confessed their problems. One cadre who had made mistakes, when he first arrived at the study class, did not have a deep understanding of his mistakes and had a bad attitude. The supporting leftist military comrades sternly pointed out his serious mistakes, set high standards, and at the same time helped him study Chairman Mao's teachings: "What attitude should all party members who have made ideological and political mistakes adopt when they are criticized? There are two paths to choose from: one is to correct the mistakes and become a good party member; the other is to degenerate and even fall into the pit of counter-revolution. The latter path does indeed exist, and counter-revolutionaries may be beckoning there!" The revolutionary masses also helped him many times, having heart-to-heart talks. After a series of meticulous and patient ideological work, this cadre finally corrected his attitude, recognized his mistakes, and made a relatively deep self-examination to the masses. He also exposed a small handful of class enemies' plot to draw him over and attempt to sabotage the newly established revolutionary committee.

The members of the revolutionary committee, through analyzing the reasons why some comrades made mistakes, deeply realized that an important reason why these people were deceived and used by the class enemies was that the "self" was at play. Therefore, they must help them thoroughly break away from "self" and firmly establish "public," completely drawing a clear line with the class enemies and truly returning to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Thus, in the study class, they further mobilized the masses to help those who had made mistakes to study and apply the "Three Constantly Read Articles," guiding them to connect their mistakes, find lessons, dig out the roots, thoroughly expose the manifestations of "self," list the crimes of "self," and talk about the harms of "self," raising their awareness of fighting against "self" and criticizing revisionism. In this way, many who had made mistakes could no longer hold back, feeling that having "self" but not exposing it, having mistakes but not correcting them, was the greatest disloyalty to Chairman Mao. Thus, in the study class, a high tide of exposing "self" and fighting against "self" quickly emerged. Those who originally feared being implicated and dared not boldly expose themselves dispelled the "fear" and voluntarily and actively confessed their problems to the masses, writing materials to expose the enemy; those who originally said half and left half, not thoroughly confessing, also rushed to thoroughly confess and expose to the masses. This expanded the scope of education, united all possible forces, making a small handful of the most stubborn class enemies more isolated, and effectively promoting the deepening of the struggle against the enemy.

    广东省和平县直属机关革命派大办毛泽东思想学习班
    认真教育和团结犯错误的同志
    稳准狠地打击一小撮阶级敌人
    本报讯　在清理阶级队伍的工作中，广东省和平县直属机关的无产阶级革命派大办毛泽东思想学习班，深入细致地做犯错误的人的思想政治工作，对他们既严格要求，又注意团结，帮助他们站到革命群众方面来，从而粉碎了阶级敌人妄图分化瓦解革命队伍的阴谋。
      不让犯错误的同志
        被敌人拉过去
    和平县直属机关在前一个时期清理阶级队伍的工作中，遵照伟大领袖毛主席关于严格区分两类不同性质的矛盾的教导，注意争取团结犯错误的干部。这些人在党的政策的感召下，纷纷觉悟过来，主动揭发阶级敌人的罪行。这使一小撮阶级敌人怕得要死，恨得要命，耍出各种阴谋手段，威胁利诱，软硬兼施，妄图把犯错误的人拉过去。在这种情况下，有少数犯错误的人也动摇起来，观望徘徊，顾虑重重。而有些革命群众没有及时识破阶级敌人的这个新阴谋，对一些犯错误的人表现了急躁情绪，放松了对他们的教育工作。
    这个问题很快引起了支左解放军同志的注意。他们和县革委会成员一起分析了这个问题，一致认为：这是一场争夺群众的激烈斗争。为了粉碎阶级敌人的新阴谋，支左人员和县革委会立即组织广大机关干部和革命群众，学习了毛主席关于对敌斗争的方针政策、严格区分两类不同性质的矛盾和正确对待犯错误同志的论述，引导大家认识阶级斗争的新形势、新特点、新动向，大家看穿了阶级敌人的新花招，气愤地说：“敌人越是害怕我们团结犯错误的同志，我们就越是要团结一切可以团结的力量共同对敌，稳、准、狠地打击一小撮阶级敌人，决不让一个犯错误的阶级兄弟被敌人拉过去！”
    严格区分两类不同性质的矛盾
    接着，支左人员和县革委会帮助直属机关大办毛泽东思想学习班，引导无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众认真做好教育、争取、团结犯错误的人的思想政治工作。他们遵照毛主席“对于那些犯了错误但是还可以教育的、同那些不可救药的分子有区别的党员和干部，不论其出身如何，都应当加以教育，而不是抛弃他们”的教导，注意调查研究，认真了解犯错误的人的全部历史，以及他们在文化大革命中的表现，对他们所犯的错误进行阶级分析，严格区分两类不同性质的矛盾。某机关有一个干部，原来是一个群众组织的头头，他由于受了党内走资派的蒙骗，干了不少坏事。当阶级敌人被揪出来以后，有些群众要把他与坏人同样进行批判斗争。在学习班里，大家对这个干部的全部历史和一贯表现进行了阶级分析，认为他还是属于好人犯错误，应该采取“团结——批评和自我批评——团结”的方法帮助和争取他。于是，大家主动团结他，对他进行热情帮助，鼓励他放下包袱，检查错误，揭发敌人。这个干部在党的政策的感召下，很快站到革命群众一边，揭发了阶级敌人的大量罪行。群众根据他揭发的线索，跟踪追击，揪出了一个暗藏了多年的国民党特务。他还以自己受骗犯错误的教训，到群众中现身说法，控诉和揭发一小撮阶级敌人的滔天罪行。一些受蒙蔽的群众在他的影响下，消除了顾虑，勇敢地投入了对敌斗争。
        把严格要求和耐心帮助结合起来
    在学习班里，有些犯过严重错误的人，对自己的错误一时认识不深刻，检查不彻底。有人主张给他们多施加“压力”。针对这种情况，革委会和支左人员又引导大家把严格要求和耐心帮助结合起来。通过做深入细致的思想政治工作，使一些犯错误的人主动交代了自己的问题。有一个犯错误的干部，刚到学习班的时候，由于对自己的错误认识不足，态度不好。支左的解放军同志严肃地指出了他的严重错误，提出严格要求，同时帮助他学习毛主席的教导：“一切犯有思想上和政治上错误的共产党员，在他们受到批评的时候，应当采取甚么态度呢？这里有两条可供选择的道路：一条是改正错误，做一个好的党员；一条是堕落下去，甚至跌入反革命坑内。这后一条路是确实存在的，反革命分子可能正在那里招手呢！”革命群众也多次对他进行帮助，个别谈心。经过一番细致耐心的思想工作，终于使这个干部端正了态度，认识到了自己的错误，向群众做了比较深刻的检查，并揭发了一小撮阶级敌人拉拢他妄图搞垮新生的革委会的阴谋。
    革委会成员从分析一些同志犯错误的原因中，深刻认识到：这些人之所以被阶级敌人蒙骗和利用，一个重要原因，就是“私”字作怪。因此，必须帮助他们大破“私”字，大立“公”字，彻底和阶级敌人划清界线，真正回到毛主席革命路线上来。于是，在学习班里又进一步发动群众帮助犯错误的同志活学活用“老三篇”，引导他们联系自己的错误，找教训，挖根源，大摆“私”字的表现，大列“私”字的罪状，大谈“私”字的危害，提高斗私批修的自觉性。这样，许多犯错误的人再也憋不住了，感到有私不亮，有错不改，是对毛主席最大的不忠，于是在学习班里很快出现了亮私斗私的高潮。一些原来害怕连累自己，不敢大胆揭发的人，也消除了“怕”字，主动积极地向群众交代自己的问题，写揭发敌人的材料；一些原来说一半，留一半，交代不彻底的人，也争先恐后地向群众彻底交代，彻底揭发。这就扩大了教育面，团结了一切可以团结的力量，使一小撮最顽固的阶级敌人更加孤立，有力地促进了对敌斗争的深入开展。　（和政宣　惠支左）
