The Afro-Asian Writers' Association has issued a statement condemning the Soviet revisionist leadership's evil deed of allowing an American plane carrying invading U.S. troops that had made an emergency landing in Soviet territory to continue to South Vietnam to massacre the Vietnamese people. The statement says, "This incident once again proves that the Soviet revisionist leadership is actively collaborating with U.S. imperialism against the free fighters of Vietnam."

The statement says: "This is a stab in the back of the Vietnamese people."

The statement issued by the Afro-Asian Writers' Association on July 7 says, "We strongly condemn the crime committed by the Soviet revisionist leadership against the Vietnamese patriotic people at a time when the progressive, revolutionary, and freedom-loving peoples of Asia, Africa, and other parts of the world are giving unconditional support to the heroic Vietnamese people in their fight to completely defeat the U.S. aggressors."

The statement says: "Through this evil act, the Soviet revisionist leadership has once again proven to the people of the world that they only oppose imperialism in words, but in action, they help U.S. imperialism against the Vietnamese patriotic and free fighters. This is the Soviet revisionist leadership's false support and true betrayal of the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression for national salvation."
