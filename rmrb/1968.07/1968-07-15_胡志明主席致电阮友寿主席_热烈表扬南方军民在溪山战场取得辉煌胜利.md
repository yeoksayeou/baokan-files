Chairman Ho Chi Minh Cables Chairman Nguyen Huu Tho
Warmly Praises the Brilliant Victory of the Military and People of the South in the Xuan Loc Battlefield

New China News Agency, Hanoi, July 14 -- According to reports from newspapers here today: Chairman Ho Chi Minh sent a cable on July 13 to Chairman Nguyen Huu Tho of the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, other members of the Central Committee, and the Command of the People's Liberation Armed Forces of South Vietnam, warmly praising the brilliant victory of the military and people of South Vietnam on the Xuan Loc battlefield. The full text of the cable is as follows:

	Chairman Nguyen Huu Tho
	Members of the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam
	Command of the People's Liberation Armed Forces of South Vietnam:

	The tightly united and courageously fighting military and people of the Quang Tri - Thua Thien - Hue region have recently achieved a brilliant victory, driving away tens of thousands of the most elite U.S. troops from Xuan Loc and inflicting on them very heavy losses. This is a great defeat for the U.S., and a great victory for us.

	Our victory at Xuan Loc demonstrates the wisdom and invincible strength of our military, people, and cadres. It has made a significant contribution to the great victories achieved throughout South Vietnam since the beginning of this year. This victory, along with our victories on other battlefields, has paved the way for even greater victories. In the North, this brilliant victory at Xuan Loc further inspires the military and people of the North, who have shot down 3,000 U.S. aggressor planes, to make even greater efforts to shoot down more U.S. aggressor planes. Although the U.S. aggressors have suffered defeats, they remain very obstinate. Our compatriots, soldiers, and cadres must always remain vigilant, fight continuously and fiercely, to seize victory.

	The military and people of the North and South unite to kill the enemy,
	The final victory will definitely be ours!

	Please convey my warmest praise to the compatriots, soldiers, and cadres of the South, especially to the compatriots, soldiers, and cadres of the Xuan Loc region.

	With warm and victorious greetings!

	Ho Chi Minh
	July 13, 1968, Hanoi

    胡志明主席致电阮友寿主席
    热烈表扬南方军民在溪山战场取得辉煌胜利
    新华社河内十四日电　据这里报纸今天报道：胡志明主席七月十三日打电报给越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会主席团主席阮友寿、阵线中央委员会的其他成员和越南南方人民解放武装力量指挥部，热烈表扬越南南方军民在溪山战场上取得的辉煌胜利。电报全文如下：阮友寿主席南方民族解放阵线中央委员会各位委员南方人民解放武装力量指挥部：
    紧密团结、勇敢战斗的广治—承天—顺化地区军民最近取得了辉煌的胜利，把成万名美国最精锐的部队打得从溪山撤走，并使他们遭到了十分惨重的损失。这是美国的一个巨大的失败，是我们一个巨大的胜利。
    我们在溪山取得的胜利，说明了我们军民和干部的才智和无敌的力量。它为全南方初春以来的巨大胜利作出了应有的贡献，这一胜利和我们在其他各个战场上取得的胜利，为更大的胜利开辟了道路。在北方，溪山的这一辉煌胜利，更加鞭策建立了击落三千架美国强盗飞机战功的北方军民去作出更大的努力，击落更多的美国强盗飞机。美国强盗虽然遭到了失败，但仍然十分顽固。我们同胞、战士和干部必须经常地保持警惕，连续和狠狠地打，以夺取胜利。
    南北一心努力杀敌，
    最后胜利一定属于我们！
    请主席和各位向南方的同胞、战士和干部，特别是溪山地区的同胞、战士和干部，转达我的最热烈的表扬。
    致以亲爱和决胜的敬礼！
                            胡志明
        一九六八年七月十三日于河内
