The stars in the sky forever point to the North Star,
The sunflowers on the earth forever face the sun,
Our miners' red hearts forever belong to the great leader Chairman Mao!

On the eve of the glorious 47th anniversary of the founding of the great, glorious, and correct Communist Party of China, our most beloved great teacher and great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin Biao once again received the representatives of revolutionary workers from the national coal industry. This is the greatest care and encouragement for the revolutionary workers of the national coal mines, and it is also the greatest care and encouragement for the entire working class.

The national coal industry's conference to seize the revolution and promote production was held under the warm care of the headquarters of the proletarian revolution led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin. During the conference, Chairman Mao received the representatives attending the conference twice, greatly inspiring the revolutionary workers on the coal industry front. With boundless proletarian feelings of loyalty to Chairman Mao, the broad revolutionary workers closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments, actively implement Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, and carry out the revolution with great momentum and production with fervor. Currently, more than 90% of the large coal mines directly under the Coal Industry Department have achieved revolutionary great unity, and 75% have established revolutionary committees with three-in-one combination. Under the leadership of the revolutionary committees at all levels, the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works on the coal industry front is continuously deepening, the flames of revolutionary criticism are burning more fiercely, and the broad revolutionary workers are launching relentless attacks on a handful of class enemies. The revolution has driven production. The average daily output of large coal mines in June increased by more than 10% compared to May, and many coal mines have completed the national production plan for the first half of the year ahead of schedule and overfulfilled it.

Representatives from the coal industry front across the country, on the march to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution with the hundred million people of the country, on the eve of the 47th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China, saw the great leader Chairman Mao, and were immersed in boundless happiness and immense joy. They shouted a thousand and ten thousand times, "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand, ten thousand years!" "Wishing Chairman Mao eternal life! Ten thousand, ten thousand years!"

As soon as the reception ended, the representatives rushed to the statue of Chairman Mao in the front hall of the Great Hall of the People, solemnly vowing: Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! We are determined to take Comrade Duanmu as our example, to forever be loyal to you, forever loyal to your brilliant thoughts, forever loyal to your revolutionary line. We will fight to defend your revolutionary line and die to defend your revolutionary line. After returning to their accommodations, the representatives held celebration meetings and discussion meetings overnight, sharing their thoughts and expressing their determination to forever be loyal to Chairman Mao. Reports of joy and declarations of resolve filled the halls and corridors of the representatives' accommodations. Letters, telegrams, and long-distance calls spread the great news of Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin Biao once again receiving the representatives of revolutionary workers from the coal industry front to every corner of the country.

Representatives from the coal mines of Anshan, Kailuan, and Jiaozuo, with a glorious revolutionary tradition, were deeply moved after seeing the great teacher of the proletariat, Chairman Mao. In this unforgettable moment of happiness, they recalled the great revolutionary practice of Chairman Mao leading the workers and laboring people to make revolution. The representatives from Anshan Coal Mine, recalling the glorious course of Chairman Mao personally leading the workers of Anshan to fight revolutionary struggles, were particularly moved. They said, when our party was just born, Chairman Mao came to Anshan, went down into the mines, entered the workers' dormitories, deeply understood the sufferings of the workers, awakened the workers' consciousness, and personally sowed the seeds of revolution. Later, Chairman Mao led the Anshan Workers' and Miners' Strike successfully. Today, Chairman Mao receiving us has given us boundless strength. We must follow Chairman Mao step by step, further implement Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and launch a new high tide of seizing the revolution and promoting production.

The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "The most fundamental thing in the reform of state organs is to connect with the masses." The representatives of the revolutionary committees of the coal mines of Shuangyashan, Benxi, Fushun, Fengfeng, Zaozhuang, Huainan, Datong, and Weibei, at the celebration meeting of Chairman Mao's reception, expressed their determination to closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments, to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, to grasp class struggle, to lead the revolutionary masses, and to firmly strike down a handful of class enemies, to protect the broad masses of the people. To further carry forward the style of the party closely connecting with the masses, to maintain the broadest, most frequent, and closest contact with the laboring people, to forever take root among the masses, and to make the revolutionary committees become revolutionary, authoritative, and vigorous proletarian command headquarters.

Comrade Lu Tianji, a member of the revolutionary committee of Zaozhuang Coal Mine, has seen the great leader Chairman Mao for the third time. This worker-turned-revolutionary cadre has been fighting on the front line of coal production for more than ten years, sharing the same breath and fate with the workers. When an accident occurred underground, he followed Chairman Mao's teaching of "resolving to overcome all difficulties and win victory," disregarding personal safety, and rescued more than ten class brothers. In the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, he fought against a handful of capitalist roaders within the party with the revolutionary masses, defending Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. After seeing Chairman Mao, Lu Tianji excitedly expressed his determination to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, to better study and apply Mao Zedong Thought, and to be like Comrade Duanmu, forever guarding, standing guard, and fighting for Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

Those who have endured the harsh winter know the warmth of the sun; those who have crossed the long night understand the value of light. The coal miners of our country, who were oppressed by the "three mountains" in the old society, have been liberated and emancipated under the leadership of Chairman Mao. They have an infinite love for the great leader Chairman Mao. Comrade Ma Jinbao, a nationally famous labor model and the leader of the digging team of Fengfeng Coal Mine, was moved to tears when he saw the red sun in our hearts, Chairman Mao, and shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand, ten thousand years!" In 1959, this old miner, who had suffered deeply from exploitation and oppression in the old society, was entrusted by all the workers of the mine to come to Beijing to participate in the celebration of the 10th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China and had the honor of seeing the great leader Chairman Mao twice. Since then, he has, with the spirit of moving mountains like Yu Gong, overcome the difficulties of low culture and few words, read Chairman Mao's books every day, and acted according to Chairman Mao's instructions. Since 1964, he and his digging team have been evaluated as active elements and advanced collectives in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works every year. In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, they firmly defended Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and were a red flag for seizing the revolution and promoting production in Fengfeng Coal Mine. Ma Jinbao reviewed his growth process under the nurturing of Mao Zedong Thought and said with great emotion: Mao Zedong Thought is a revolutionary treasure. With it, we workers have strength; with it, we workers have direction. I will read Chairman Mao's books for life, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and be determined to be a good miner for Chairman Mao. The old workers from the coal capital Fushun, after being received by Chairman Mao, specially held a reminiscence meeting to recall the cow-like life in the old society and compare it with today's happy days. They vowed with deep proletarian feelings for the great leader Chairman Mao: The sea may dry up, the stones may decay, but our red hearts loyal to Chairman Mao will never change.

"Without a people's army, there is nothing for the people." The soldiers of the People's Liberation Army participating in the coal industry's support-left work, following the great commander Chairman Mao's instruction of "the People's Liberation Army should support the broad leftist masses," have made outstanding achievements in seizing the revolution and promoting production in various mining areas with the revolutionary workers, and have done new deeds for the people. Today, these soldiers of the Liberation Army, after seeing Chairman Mao, were extremely moved. They expressed their determination to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, to believe in the masses, to rely on the masses, and to seize the revolution and promote production with the broad revolutionary workers on the coal industry front to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The responsible comrade of the support-left troops in Pingyin Coal Mine, Tao Huan, recalled in this unforgettable moment of happiness that in the old society, his father was cruelly oppressed and exploited by imperialism in Kailuan Coal Mine, and the whole family lived a miserable life of hunger and cold; he recalled his growth process under the nurturing of Mao Zedong Thought. He said, the bitterness of the old society is endless, and Chairman Mao's kindness is endless. This revolutionary old soldier, who has made outstanding achievements in the Anti-Japanese War, the War of Liberation, and the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, and in the support-left work, expressed his determination to follow Chairman Mao's teaching of "not to eat old capital, but to create new achievements," to be like Comrade Duanmu, "to think of Chairman Mao in everything, to obey Chairman Mao in everything, to follow Chairman Mao in everything, and to do everything for Chairman Mao," and to create new achievements in the "three supports, two militaries" work.

The ship sailing on the sea relies on the helmsman; to make a revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought. After seeing Chairman Mao, the geologists exploring coal resources in Chairman Mao's hometown excitedly said, Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! Your brilliant thoughts have shown us the road to victory. To reverse the situation of coal being transported from north to south, over the past two years, the geologists of this exploration team, through hard work, have found rich coal resources in Chairman Mao's hometown—Hunan, and smashed the fallacy of "no coal in Jiangnan." In those days of traversing the mountains to explore coal, the geologists longed to see Chairman Mao! Today, the geologists' wish has finally come true. They shouted and jumped for joy, and could not help but shed tears of joy. As soon as the reception ended, they immediately sent this great piece of news overnight to every construction area and drilling machine, letting the comrades fighting on the front line of production share this greatest happiness.

    毛主席啊！我们永远做忠于您的好矿工
    天上的群星永远朝北斗，
    地上的葵花永远向太阳，
    我们矿工的红心啊，
    永远忠于伟大领袖毛主席！
    在伟大的、光荣的、正确的中国共产党诞生四十七周年光辉节日的前夕，我们最敬爱的伟大导师、伟大领袖毛主席和他的亲密战友林彪副主席，再次接见了全国煤炭工业战线上的革命职工的代表，这是对全国煤矿革命职工的最大关怀和最大鼓舞，也是对全国工人阶级的最大关怀和最大鼓舞。
    全国煤炭工业战线抓革命、促生产会议，是在以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的亲切关怀下召开的。会议期间，毛主席两次接见了出席会议的代表，使煤炭工业战线上的广大革命职工，受到了极大的鼓舞。广大革命职工怀着对毛主席无限忠诚的深厚无产阶级感情，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，积极落实毛主席的一系列最新指示，把革命搞得轰轰烈烈，生产搞得热气腾腾。目前，煤炭工业部直属的大型煤矿，百分之九十以上实现了革命的大联合，其中百分之七十五建立了三结合的革命委员会。在各级革命委员会的领导下，煤炭工业战线活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动不断深入发展，革命大批判的烈火越烧越旺，广大革命职工不停顿地向一小撮阶级敌人发动了猛烈的进攻。革命带动了生产。六月份大型煤矿平均日产量比五月份提高百分之十以上，不少煤矿提前超额完成上半年的国家生产计划。
    来自全国各地煤炭工业战线的革命职工代表，在全国亿万军民夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的征途中，在中国共产党成立四十七周年的前夕，见到伟大领袖毛主席，个个沉浸在无限幸福和无比欢乐之中，他们千遍万遍地高呼：“毛主席万岁！万万岁！”“敬祝毛主席万寿无疆！万寿无疆！”
    接见刚刚结束，代表们纷纷奔向人民大会堂前厅毛主席塑像前，庄严宣誓：毛主席啊，毛主席！我们决心以门合同志为榜样，永远忠于您，永远忠于您的光辉思想，永远忠于您的革命路线。我们生为捍卫您的革命路线而战斗，死为捍卫您的革命路线而献身。回到住地以后，代表们连夜举行庆祝会、座谈会，畅谈感想，表示永远忠于毛主席的决心。喜报、决心书，贴满了代表们住地的各个大厅和走廊。一封封书信，一份份电报，一个个长途电话，向全国各地传播着毛主席和他的亲密战友林彪副主席又一次接见煤炭工业战线革命职工代表的特大喜讯。
    来自具有光荣革命传统的安源、开滦、焦作煤矿的代表，见到了无产阶级的伟大导师毛主席以后，感动得彻夜未眠。在这终生难忘的幸福时刻，他们亲切地回忆起伟大领袖毛主席领导工人阶级和劳动人民闹革命的伟大革命实践。安源煤矿的代表在回忆伟大领袖毛主席亲自领导安源工人进行革命斗争的光辉历程时，心情特别激动。他们说，在我们党刚诞生的时候，毛主席就来到安源，下矿井，进工棚，深入了解工人疾苦，启发工人觉悟，亲手播下了革命的火种。以后，毛主席又多次来到我们矿工中间，胜利地领导了安源路矿大罢工。今天，毛主席接见我们，给了我们无穷的力量，我们一定要步步紧跟毛主席，进一步贯彻毛主席的革命路线，掀起抓革命、促生产的新高潮。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“国家机关的改革，最根本的一条，就是联系群众。”受到毛主席接见的双鸭山、本溪、阜新、峰峰、枣庄、淮南、大同、渭北等煤矿革命委员会的代表，在庆祝毛主席接见的座谈会上纷纷表示，一定要紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，狠抓阶级斗争，带领革命群众，稳、准、狠地打击一小撮阶级敌人，坚决保护广大人民群众。要进一步发扬党的紧密联系群众的作风，同劳动人民保持最广泛的、经常的、密切的联系，永远扎根于群众之中，使革命委员会成为革命的、有无产阶级权威的、朝气蓬勃的战斗指挥部。
    枣庄煤矿革命委员会委员鹿田计，是第三次见到伟大领袖毛主席。这位工人出身的革命干部，十多年来，一直以一个普通劳动者的身份，战斗在煤炭生产的第一线，和工人群众同呼吸、共命运。当井下发生事故时，他遵照毛主席“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”的教导，不顾个人安危，抢救了十多个阶级兄弟的生命。在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，他又同革命群众一起造党内一小撮走资派的反，保卫毛主席的革命路线。鹿田计见到毛主席后，激动地表示，一定要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，更好地活学活用毛泽东思想，象门合同志那样，永远为毛主席的革命路线放好哨，站好岗，打好仗。
    熬过严冬的人，最知道太阳的温暖；渡过长夜的人，最懂得光明的可贵。在万恶的旧社会身受“三座大山”重压的我国煤矿工人，在毛主席的领导下得到了翻身解放，他们无限热爱伟大领袖毛主席。全国著名劳动模范、峰峰煤矿掘进队队长马金宝，见到我们心中的红太阳毛主席的时候，激动得热泪盈眶，一遍又一遍地欢呼：“毛主席万岁！万万岁！”一九五九年，这个在旧社会深受剥削和压迫的老矿工接受全矿职工的委托，来到北京参加中华人民共和国成立十周年的庆祝大典，曾经两次光荣地见到了伟大领袖毛主席。从此，他以愚公移山的革命精神，克服了文化低、认字少的困难，天天读毛主席的书，按照毛主席的指示办事。从一九六四年开始，他和他所在的掘进队年年被评为活学活用毛主席著作的积极分子和先进集体。在无产阶级文化大革命中，他们坚决捍卫毛主席的革命路线，是峰峰煤矿抓革命、促生产的一面红旗。马金宝回顾了自己在毛泽东思想哺育下成长的过程，满怀激情地说：毛泽东思想是革命的宝，有了她，我们工人有力量，有了她，我们工人有方向。我要一辈子读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，决心做毛主席的好矿工。来自煤都抚顺的老工人，在受到毛主席接见以后，专门举行了忆苦思甜的座谈会，回忆在旧社会牛马不如的生活，对比今天幸福的日子。他们怀着对伟大领袖毛主席无比深厚的无产阶级感情宣誓：海可枯，石可烂，忠于毛主席的红心永不变。
      “没有一个人民的军队，便没有人民的一切。”参加煤炭工业战线支左工作的人民解放军指战员，遵照伟大统帅毛主席“人民解放军应该支持左派广大群众”的指示，在各个矿区同革命职工一起抓革命、促生产，作出了优异成绩，为人民立了新功。今天，这些解放军同志见到了毛主席后，万分激动，他们表示决心，要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，相信群众，依靠群众，和煤炭工业战线广大革命职工一起，狠抓革命，猛促生产，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。驻井陉煤矿支左部队负责人陶涵在见到毛主席这一终生难忘的幸福时刻，回忆起在万恶的旧社会，父亲在开滦煤矿受帝国主义的残酷压迫和剥削，全家过着饥寒交迫的悲惨生活；回忆起自己在毛泽东思想哺育下成长的过程。他说，旧社会的苦处诉不尽，毛主席的恩情说不完。这位在抗日战争、解放战争和抗美援朝战争中为人民立过战功，在支左工作中作出出色成绩的革命老战士表示，一定要遵照毛主席关于“不要吃老本，要立新功”的教导，象门合同志那样，“一切想着毛主席，一切服从毛主席，一切紧跟毛主席，一切为着毛主席”，在“三支”“两军”工作中再立新功。
    大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想。在毛主席家乡勘查煤炭资源的勘探队员们，见到毛主席以后激动地说，毛主席啊，毛主席！您的光辉思想为我们指示了胜利前进的道路。为了扭转北煤南运的情况，两年来，这个勘探队的地质人员经过辛勤劳动，在毛主席的家乡——湖南找到了丰富的煤炭资源，粉碎了“江南无煤”的谬论。在那踏遍群峰探乌金的日子里，勘探队员们多么想见到毛主席啊！今天，勘探队员们的愿望终于实现了。他们欢呼跳跃，禁不住流下了喜悦的泪花。接见刚刚结束，他们立刻就把这一特大喜讯连夜传到了每一个施工区、钻机旁，让战斗在生产第一线的同志们，分享这一最大的幸福。　新华社记者
