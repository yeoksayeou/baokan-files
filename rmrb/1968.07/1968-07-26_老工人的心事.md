After the establishment of the factory revolutionary committee, a vigorous mass movement to launch a fierce attack on class enemies quickly unfolded.

Old worker Zhang Weigan took the lead, standing at the forefront of the class struggle, and together with all the revolutionary workers in the factory, he fought with high spirits to thoroughly expose and criticize hidden traitors, spies, and remnants of the Nationalist reactionaries.

Coincidentally, at this critical moment, his arthritis in his legs flared up, and every step he took was so painful that he gritted his teeth. After the factory revolutionary committee discovered this, they immediately informed the clinic to send him medicine and granted him half a month of sick leave to rest well. The care from the leadership and the concern from his comrades moved Zhang so much that he couldn't speak. He held the medicine and the sick leave note, and tears welled up in his eyes.

This old worker, who had suffered greatly in the old society, could never forget the painful experiences he endured in that wicked old society. At the age of fifteen, he was forced to work for the capitalists, eating food fit for pigs and dogs, doing the work of oxen and horses, enduring beatings and curses, and suffering all kinds of humiliation. Once, a large sulfuric acid tank broke, and the capitalist forced Zhang to climb inside to repair it. As a result, the highly corrosive sulfuric acid splashed all over Zhang, poisoning him and causing him to fall seriously ill. The heartless capitalist not only refused to treat him but kicked him out of the factory gate.

Thinking of the past and looking at the present, he felt deeply grateful to Chairman Mao and loved the new revolutionary government from the bottom of his heart.

At night, Zhang lay in bed, tossing and turning, unable to sleep. After the establishment of the revolutionary committee, the sharp and complex class struggle in the factory played out in his mind like a movie: some bad elements incited some people to oppose the revolutionary committee, threatening to "rebel again" and overthrow the revolutionary committee. One person even openly came out to reverse the verdict on the capitalist roaders, reverse the verdict on the capitalist reactionary line, and reverse the verdict on landlords, rich farmers, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists. These shocking class struggle facts made Zhang more and more uneasy. He thought: the class enemies are even dreaming of overthrowing our revolutionary government, how can I just lie down and rest because of a little illness while the enemy is wielding a knife to attack us?

Thinking of this, Zhang was very excited. The next day, he got up early in the morning and went to work. Although his legs couldn't stand, he insisted on sitting on a stool and engaged in face-to-face struggle with the class enemies, fiercely exposing and criticizing the crimes of the class enemies.

Zhang was like this, cherishing the revolutionary committee as he would his own eyes, vowing to defend it to the death, and resolutely fighting against the class enemies. Together with all the revolutionary workers in the factory, under the leadership of the revolutionary committee, he smashed the class enemies' plot to split the revolutionary committee.

    老工人的心事
    厂革委会成立以后，一场向阶级敌人猛烈进攻的群众运动很快开展起来。
    老工人张维艮奋勇当先，站在阶级斗争第一线，和全厂革命职工一起，斗志昂扬地深挖猛揭暗藏的叛徒、特务和国民党反动派的残渣余孽。
    偏巧，在这个节骨眼上，他腿上的关节炎复发了，每走一步都疼得直咬牙根。厂革委会发现后，马上告诉卫生所给他送来了药品，并批了半个月的病假，让他好好休息。领导的关怀，同志们的照顾，使张师傅感动得说不出话来。他手握药片和假条，眼泪禁不住夺眶而出。
    这个饱经旧社会苦难煎熬的老工人，怎能忘记在那万恶的旧社会的痛苦遭遇。他十几岁被迫给资本家做工，吃的是猪狗食，干的是牛马活，挨打挨骂，受尽了欺凌。一次，一个大硫酸罐坏了，资本家硬逼着张师傅爬到里面去修理，结果腐蚀性很大的硫酸，沾了张师傅一身，中了毒，得了重病。狼心狗肺的资本家不但不给医治，反而一脚把他踢出了工厂大门。
    想想过去，看看现在，他从心眼里感谢毛主席，热爱新生的革命政权。
    晚上，张师傅躺在床上翻来复去睡不着。革委会成立后，厂子里尖锐复杂的阶级斗争，又象演电影一样，一幕幕地出现在眼前：有的坏家伙煽动一些群众和革委会闹对立，扬言要“重新造反”，推翻革委会。有个家伙公然跳出来为走资派翻案，为资产阶级反动路线翻案，为地、富、反、坏、右分子翻案。这些触目惊心的阶级斗争事实，使张师傅越想越不安。他想：阶级敌人连做梦都盘算着颠覆我们的革命政权，我怎么能眼看着敌人拿着刀向我们砍来，却因为有一点病就躺下休息呢？
    想到这里，张师傅十分激动。第二天，他一清早就爬起来上班去了。虽然他的腿站不住，但他坚持坐在凳子上和阶级敌人展开了面对面的斗争，狠狠地揭发和批判了阶级敌人的罪行。
    张师傅就是这样象爱护眼珠一样爱护革委会，誓死捍卫革委会，向阶级敌人做坚决斗争，和全厂革命职工一起在革委会的领导下，粉碎了阶级敌人妄图分裂革委会的阴谋。
