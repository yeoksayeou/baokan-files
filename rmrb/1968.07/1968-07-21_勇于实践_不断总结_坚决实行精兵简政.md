The revolutionary committee of Chuan Sha County, following Chairman Mao's teaching of "breaking down and establishing within," has, in the process of streamlining and reducing bureaucracy, severely criticized the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of Chinese Khrushchev in the construction of political power and mobilized the masses to fight against class enemies. Through four practices, they gradually organized a revolutionary leadership cadre that is closely connected with the masses, and the work situation has been greatly improved.

Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, July 20th - Under the assistance of the People's Liberation Army's propaganda team for Mao Zedong Thought, the revolutionary committee of Chuan Sha County in the suburbs of Shanghai has used great Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, dared to practice, and continuously summarized experiences in practice, resolutely implementing streamlining and reducing bureaucracy. They have taken a big step forward towards the goal of "organizing a revolutionary leadership cadre that is closely connected with the masses."

After the establishment of the county revolutionary committee in March last year, they continuously practiced streamlining and reducing bureaucracy. Initially, they did not fully recognize that this was a profound and sharp class struggle, and they also lacked experience. In the process of streamlining and reducing bureaucracy, they took some detours. The first time was when the county revolutionary committee was just established. They broke down the old overlapping administrative organizations and established "four groups and one office." However, the work organization was still very large, with five or six hundred staff members. The second time was in October last year when they reduced the number of staff to two or three hundred, and the organization also underwent corresponding changes. The third time was in March this year when they further reduced the organization and staff. However, because they did not thoroughly criticize the counter-revolutionary revisionist line that Chinese Khrushchev promoted in the construction of political power, they only focused on reducing staff, so the old habits of the old organizations still stubbornly played a role. These three practices of streamlining and reducing bureaucracy made the members of the county revolutionary committee deeply realize that streamlining and reducing bureaucracy is a major issue related to anti-revisionism, preventing revisionism, consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat, and preventing capitalist restoration. It will inevitably be interfered with and obstructed by class enemies and old forces of habit. Therefore, to do a good job in streamlining and reducing bureaucracy, one must start from raising the awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines, and accelerate the thought revolutionization of the leadership cadre. Only in this way can one achieve comprehensive progress and truly organize a revolutionary leadership cadre that is closely connected with the masses.

After raising their awareness, they further seriously studied Chairman Mao's relevant teachings. In April and May this year, they carried out streamlining and reducing bureaucracy again. This time, because they grasped the root cause, although the number of people was reduced to only over fifty, and the organization had only "two departments and one office," the work situation was greatly improved, combat effectiveness was greatly enhanced, and they effectively led the revolutionary and production struggles throughout the county, receiving strong support and praise from the broad revolutionary masses.

It is necessary to carry out revolutionary criticism and struggle against old habits

Chairman Mao teaches: "One of the important tasks on our ideological front at present is to carry out a criticism of revisionism." "The present situation and habits often bind people's minds tightly, even revolutionaries sometimes cannot escape." The revolutionary committee of Chuan Sha County, following the great leader Chairman Mao's teachings, carried out revolutionary criticism of the counter-revolutionary revisionist line that Chinese Khrushchev promoted in the construction of political power in the process of streamlining and reducing bureaucracy, and at the same time criticized the influence of various old habits.

Chuan Sha County is a large county with a population of 570,000. After liberation, the development of agriculture, industry, and cultural education has been relatively fast. The county alone has 62 factories, 31 complete middle schools and primary schools, and 60 agricultural middle schools and private middle schools. When the county revolutionary committee proposed resolutely taking the road of streamlining and reducing bureaucracy, due to the lingering influence of the counter-revolutionary revisionist line that Chinese Khrushchev promoted in the construction of political power and the influence of old habits, some cadres had various thoughts. Some said, "There are so many things to do, and even with more people, we can hardly manage. With fewer people, it won't work." Some had a "let's try" attitude of following the crowd. The revolutionary committee and the soldiers from the PLA deeply felt from the experiences and lessons of the first three practices of streamlining and reducing bureaucracy that to carry out streamlining and reducing bureaucracy, one must follow Chairman Mao's teaching of "breaking down and establishing within," thoroughly criticize and expose the revisionist line of Chinese Khrushchev in the construction of political power politically, ideologically, and theoretically, and also criticize the influence of old habits, so that everyone can distinguish between Chairman Mao's proletarian line of political power construction and the revisionist line of political power construction, between socialism and capitalism. Only in this way can one have a clear direction and great determination.

To better arm everyone's minds, the People's Liberation Army's propaganda team for Mao Zedong Thought assisted the revolutionary committee in organizing the office staff to hold a Mao Zedong Thought study class. The participants repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions: "The basic experience of the revolutionary committee has three points: one is the representative of revolutionary cadres, one is the representative of the army, and one is the representative of revolutionary masses, realizing the three-in-one combination of the revolution. The revolutionary committee should implement unified leadership, break down overlapping administrative organizations, streamline and reduce bureaucracy, and organize a revolutionary leadership cadre that is closely connected with the masses." They used Chairman Mao's latest instructions as a weapon, combined with actual situations, and severely criticized the revisionist line of Chinese Khrushchev in the construction of political power. They studied one of Chairman Mao's sayings, criticized one of Chinese Khrushchev's counter-revolutionary revisionist fallacies, eliminated one stream of poison, and further established the ideas of "streamlining and reducing bureaucracy," "the masses are the true heroes," and "wholeheartedly serving the people." Through intensive study and criticism, everyone further recognized the great significance of streamlining and reducing bureaucracy in preventing revisionism, ensuring that our country will never change color.

To further carry out revolutionary criticism and overcome conservative thoughts among office staff, they also moved the Mao Zedong Thought study class to Jiang Town Commune's Wei Dong Brigade, where the study and application of Mao Zedong Thought was relatively advanced throughout the county. All staff members ate, lived, worked, studied, and criticized and exposed revisionism together with poor and lower-middle peasants. At the same time, they mobilized poor and lower-middle peasants to comment on office work, raise problems, express opinions, and dig out the root causes to promote the streamlining and reducing bureaucracy of the office. The revolutionary spirit of poor and lower-middle peasants, who are simple, hardworking, and brave, educated everyone greatly. Some cadres saw that they were picky about work, could not carry baskets, and could not shoulder burdens, deeply feeling that "after entering the city and staying in the office for a long time, receiving more salary, becoming a bigger official, and having a better life, their thoughts have changed," further seeing the harm of the revisionist line that Chinese Khrushchev promoted in the construction of political power to cadres.

Therefore, they greatly strengthened their determination to carry out streamlining and reducing bureaucracy and thoroughly change the old organizations and old habits. They all requested to go deep into the grassroots level, to the front line of class struggle, to propagate Mao Zedong Thought, and to reform their worldview. The revolutionary committee, except for leaving a part of the cadres to participate in the work of the revolutionary committee, sent the rest of the cadres to participate in the struggle, criticism, and transformation of the office, taking a big step on the road of streamlining and reducing bureaucracy.

It is necessary to struggle against class enemies

Chairman Mao teaches: "Imperialists and domestic reactionaries will never reconcile themselves to their defeat, and they will make their last struggle." Just when the office staff of Chuan Sha County raised their awareness, with red-hearted loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, and deep hatred for the revisionist line of Chinese Khrushchev, resolutely taking the road of streamlining and reducing bureaucracy, a small handful of class enemies jumped out, spreading evil winds and setting off ghost fires from behind, attempting to sow discord between the revolutionary committee and office cadres, create ideological confusion among office cadres, and sabotage the smooth progress of the work of streamlining and reducing bureaucracy.

The People's Liberation Army's propaganda team for Mao Zedong Thought and the revolutionary committee, using Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, analyzed these phenomena and realized that streamlining and reducing bureaucracy is a sharp and profound class struggle. It is necessary to firmly grasp the class struggle and further raise the awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines among office staff. This is a key to ensuring the victory of the work of streamlining and reducing bureaucracy. They immediately organized office staff to seriously study Chairman Mao's teachings on class and class struggle and a series of latest instructions, further severely criticizing Chinese Khrushchev's theory of "the extinction of class struggle." At the same time, they invited poor and lower-middle peasants to recall bitterness and think of sweetness, deeply carrying out the "three recalls and three comparisons" activities: recalling the bitterness of the old society and comparing the sweetness of the new society; recalling the bitterness of the bourgeois reactionary line and comparing the sweetness of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line; recalling the thorough revolutionary spirit of revolutionary martyrs and comparing their own loyalty to the great teacher Chairman Mao. Through recalling bitterness and thinking of sweetness, the political awareness of office staff was greatly raised. Then, they mobilized everyone to use the perspective of class and class struggle to expose the cover of class struggle, dig out the bad elements that sabotaged the work of streamlining and reducing bureaucracy, and use these class enemies as living examples to severely criticize the revisionist line of Chinese Khrushchev in the construction of political power again. Through the struggle, everyone's eyes were further brightened, laying the ideological foundation for doing a good job in streamlining and reducing bureaucracy and cleaning up the class ranks.

It is necessary to struggle against selfish thoughts

Chairman Mao teaches: "The Fourth Red Army of the Communist Party has various non-proletarian thoughts, which greatly hinder the implementation of the party's correct line." In this county, in the process of achieving streamlining and reducing bureaucracy and organizing new work organizations, and after the establishment of new work organizations, it was found that some cadres, due to the influence of bourgeois thoughts, revealed various individualistic emotions. On the issue of streamlining and reducing bureaucracy, some cadres' minds had a sharp struggle between the proletarian "public" and the bourgeois "private." With the assistance of the People's Liberation Army's propaganda team for Mao Zedong Thought, the revolutionary committee held two sessions of Mao Zedong Thought study classes for office cadres in the production teams. In the study process, they organized office cadres to learn from poor and lower-middle peasants as teachers, work, study, and criticize and expose revisionism together with poor and lower-middle peasants. The poor and lower-middle peasants' eagerness to study Chairman Mao's works, their thorough and resolute spirit of criticizing and exposing revisionism, greatly moved the office staff. They, together with poor and lower-middle peasants, severely criticized Chinese Khrushchev's revisionist black goods of "merging public and private" and "suffering small losses to gain big benefits," and carried out activities to learn from cadres who are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, such as Meng He. They found gaps and investigated causes. As the study activities deepened, some cadres deeply felt that compared to Meng He, they had a great gap in being infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, to Mao Zedong Thought, and to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and in the awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines. They also realized that the reason for this situation was that they had been detached from the masses for a long time, always sitting in the office, and their ideological reform had been relaxed, and their selfish thoughts had become heavier. Through criticizing and exposing revisionism together with poor and lower-middle peasants, they loved Chairman Mao more and hated Chinese Khrushchev more, enhancing their awareness of breaking private thoughts and establishing public thoughts. They said: "Loyalty is shown in actions. Wherever the party arranges us, we will do revolution there."

The revolutionary committee and the soldiers from the PLA also paid great attention to the daily political and ideological work of the revolutionary committee staff, helping them to break private thoughts and establish public thoughts, accelerate thought revolutionization, and firmly take the road of emphasizing proletarian politics in the situation of busy work, few people, heavy tasks, and high requirements. As a result, the thought revolutionization of all revolutionary committee staff was greatly promoted. Now, the members and staff of this county's revolutionary committee are full of vigor and enthusiasm, and they all take pride in being servants of the people and shame in being officials and lords; they take pride in going deep into the grassroots level and shame in pursuing special treatment; they take pride in humbly listening to the opinions of the masses and shame in being detached from the masses. The broad poor and lower-middle peasants are very satisfied with the revolutionary committee's serious implementation of streamlining and reducing bureaucracy and the establishment of new revolutionary styles.

    勇于实践　不断总结　坚决实行精兵简政
     海川沙县革委会，遵循毛主席“破字当头，立在其中”的教导，在实行精兵简政的过程中，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫在政权建设方面的反革命修正主义路线，发动群众和阶级敌人作斗争。经过四次实践，逐步组织起一个革命化的密切联系群众的领导班子，工作面貌焕然一新
    新华社上海二十日电　上海市郊区川沙县革命委员会在人民解放军毛泽东思想宣传队的帮助下，以伟大的毛泽东思想为武器，勇于实践，并且在实践中不断总结经验，坚决实行精兵简政，朝着“组织起一个革命化的联系群众的领导班子”的目标前进了一大步。
    川沙县革委会在去年三月份建立后，就不断进行实践，实行精兵简政。开始时，他们由于没有充分认识这是一场深刻的、尖锐的阶级斗争，同时也缺乏经验，在实行精兵简政的过程中，曾走了一些弯路。第一次是在县革委会刚成立的时候，他们打破旧的重叠的行政机构，建立了“四组一室”。但这时的工作机构仍然很庞大，工作人员共有五六百人。第二次是去年十月份，他们把工作人员减少到二三百人，机构也进行了相应的变动。第三次是在今年三月份，他们进一步缩小了机构，减少了人员。但是，由于没有彻底批判中国赫鲁晓夫在政权建设方面所推行的反革命修正主义路线，只侧重于减少人员，因而旧机关的旧作风仍然顽固地起着作用。这三次精兵简政的实践，使县革委会成员深深地认识到：精兵简政是关系到反修防修、巩固无产阶级专政、防止资本主义复辟的大事，它必然会受到阶级敌人以及旧的习惯势力的干扰和阻挠。因此，要搞好精兵简政，必须从提高阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟、加速领导班子的思想革命化着手。只有这样，才能一通百通，真正组织起一个革命化的联系群众的领导班子。
    认识提高以后，他们进一步认真学习了毛主席的有关教导，在今年四五月间再一次进行了精兵简政。这一次由于抓住了根本，人数虽然减少到只有五十多人，机构只有“两部一室”，但是工作面貌却焕然一新，战斗力大大加强，有力地领导了全县的革命和生产斗争，受到了广大革命群众的热烈支持和称赞。
      必须开展革命大批判，必须和旧的
  习惯势力作斗争
    毛主席教导说：“我们现在思想战线上的一个重要任务，就是要开展对于修正主义的批判。”“现状和习惯往往容易把人们的头脑束缚得紧紧的，即使是革命者有时也不能免。”川沙县革委会遵照伟大领袖毛主席的教导，在实行精兵简政过程中，对中国赫鲁晓夫在政权建设方面推行的反革命修正主义路线进行了革命的大批判，同时批判了各种旧的习惯势力的影响。
    川沙县是一个大县，有五十七万人口，解放后农业、工业、文化教育事业的发展都比较快。全县仅县属工厂就有六十二个，县属的完全中学、初级中学有三十一所，农业中学和民办中学有六十所。当县革委会提出坚决走精兵简政的道路的时候，由于中国赫鲁晓夫在政权建设方面推行的反革命修正主义路线的流毒还没有肃清，由于旧作风的影响，有些干部产生了种种活思想。有的说：“这么多的事，人多还忙不过来，人少了不行。”有的抱着“试试看”的随大流态度。革委会和解放军同志从前三次实行精兵简政的经验教训中深刻体会到，实行精兵简政，一定要遵循毛主席“破字当头，立在其中”的教导，把中国赫鲁晓夫在政权建设方面的修正主义路线，从政治上、思想上、理论上批倒批臭，还要批判旧的习惯势力的影响，使大家分清什么是毛主席的无产阶级政权建设路线，什么是修正主义的政权建设路线，什么是社会主义，什么是资本主义。只有这样，才能方向明，决心大。
    为了更好地武装大家的头脑，人民解放军毛泽东思想宣传队协助革委会组织机关工作人员办起了毛泽东思想学习班。参加学习班的人员，反复学习了毛主席的最新指示：“革命委员会的基本经验有三条：一条是有革命干部的代表，一条是有军队的代表，一条是有革命群众的代表，实现了革命的三结合。革命委员会要实行一元化的领导，打破重叠的行政机构，精兵简政，组织起一个革命化的联系群众的领导班子。”他们以毛主席的这一最新指示为武器，结合实际，狠批了中国赫鲁晓夫在政权建设方面的修正主义路线。他们学习毛主席的一条语录，批判中国赫鲁晓夫的一个反革命修正主义谬论，肃清一股流毒，进一步树立了“精兵简政”、“群众是真正的英雄”和“全心全意地为人民服务”等观点。通过大学习、大批判，大家更加认清了精兵简政对防修反修、保证我们国家永不变色的伟大意义。
    为了进一步开展革命的大批判，克服机关工作人员中的保守思想，他们还把毛泽东思想学习班搬到全县活学活用毛泽东思想比较先进的江镇公社卫东大队去办。全体人员跟贫下中农同吃、同住、同劳动、同学习、同斗私批修，同时发动贫下中农对机关工作提意见，摆问题，谈看法，挖根子，以推动机关的精兵简政。贫下中农艰苦朴素、勤劳勇敢的革命精神，对大家教育很大。一些干部看看自己做事拈轻怕重，手不能提篮，肩不能挑担，深深感到“进了城市，在机关蹲久了，薪水多了，官做大了，生活好了，思想起了变化”，进一步看到了中国赫鲁晓夫在政权建设方面推行的修正主义路线对干部的毒害。
    因此，大大增强了他们实行精兵简政，彻底改变旧机构旧作风的决心。他们纷纷要求深入基层，到阶级斗争第一线，宣传毛泽东思想，改造自己的世界观。革委会除留一部分干部参加革委会的工作外，其余的干部参加机关的斗、批、改，在精兵简政的道路上迈出了一大步。
    必须和阶级敌人作斗争
    毛主席教导说：“帝国主义者和国内反动派决不甘心于他们的失败，他们还要作最后的挣扎。”正当川沙县机关的工作人员提高了认识，怀着对伟大领袖毛主席的赤胆忠心，对中国赫鲁晓夫修正主义路线的刻骨仇恨，坚决走精兵简政的道路的时候，一小撮阶级敌人跳了出来，在背后煽阴风，点鬼火，妄图挑拨革委会同机关干部的关系，在机关干部中制造思想混乱，破坏精兵简政工作的顺利开展。
    人民解放军毛泽东思想宣传队和革委会以毛泽东思想为武器，分析了这种种现象，认识到：精兵简政是一场尖锐、深刻的阶级斗争。一定要狠抓阶级斗争，进一步提高机关工作人员的阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟。这是保证精兵简政工作胜利前进的一个关键。他们立即组织机关工作人员，认真学习毛主席关于阶级和阶级斗争的教导和一系列最新指示，进一步狠批中国赫鲁晓夫的“阶级斗争熄灭”论。在这同时，他们还请贫下中农忆苦思甜，深入地开展了“三忆三比”活动：忆旧社会的苦，比新社会的甜；忆资产阶级反动路线的苦，比毛主席无产阶级革命路线的甜；忆革命先烈的彻底革命精神，比自己对伟大导师毛主席的忠心。通过忆苦思甜，机关工作人员政治觉悟大大提高。接着，他们又发动大家用阶级和阶级斗争的观点，大揭阶级斗争盖子，挖出了破坏精兵简政工作的坏人，并且以这些阶级敌人作为活生生的事例，再一次狠批了中国赫鲁晓夫在政权建设方面的修正主义路线。通过斗争，进一步擦亮了大家的眼睛，为搞好精兵简政和清理阶级队伍的工作，打下了思想基础。
    必须和私心杂念作斗争
    毛主席教导说：“红军第四军的共产党内存在着各种非无产阶级的思想，这对于执行党的正确路线，妨碍极大。”这个县在实现精兵简政、组织新的工作机构过程中，以及新的工作机构建立以后，不断发现有些干部由于资产阶级思想影响，流露出种种个人主义的情绪。在精兵简政问题上，有些干部头脑里展开了一场无产阶级的“公”字和资产阶级的“私”字的尖锐斗争。革委会在人民解放军毛泽东思想宣传队的帮助下，又在生产队举办了两期机关干部毛泽东思想学习班。在学习过程中，组织机关干部拜贫下中农为师，和贫下中农一起劳动，一起学习，一起斗私批修。贫下中农学习毛主席著作如饥似渴，斗私批修，坚决彻底的革命精神，使机关工作人员很受感动。他们同贫下中农一起，狠批了中国赫鲁晓夫的“公私溶化”论和
  “吃小亏占大便宜”等修正主义黑货，并且开展了学习无限忠于毛主席革命路线的好干部门合的活动，找差距，查原因。随着学习活动的深入开展，一些干部深深感到，自己和门合同志相比，在无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于毛泽东思想，无限忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线方面，在阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟方面，有很大差距。他们还认识到，所以出现这种情况，根源是长期脱离群众，老是坐在机关里，思想改造放松了，私心也重了。经过同贫下中农一起斗私批修，他们对毛主席更加热爱，对中国赫鲁晓夫更加仇恨，增强了破私立公的自觉性。他们说：“忠不忠，看行动，党把我安排在什么地方，我们就在什么地方干革命。”
    革委会和解放军同志还十分重视革委会工作人员的日常的政治思想工作，帮助他们破私立公，加速思想革命化，在工作忙，人员少，任务重，要求高的情况下，坚定地走突出无产阶级政治的道路。这样做的结果，有力地推动了全体革委会工作人员的思想革命化。现在，这个县革委会的成员和工作人员，朝气勃勃，干劲十足，他们都以当人民勤务员为荣，以做官当老爷为耻；以深入基层为荣，以搞特殊化为耻；以虚心听取群众意见为荣，以脱离群众为耻。广大贫下中农对革委会认真实行精兵简政和树立起新的革命作风非常满意。
