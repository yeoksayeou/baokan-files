The revolutionary workers of the Liaoning salt fields, with the help of the People's Liberation Army's Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams, have been vigorously carrying out class struggle and conducting a thorough and sustained revolutionary criticism. The revolutionary and production situation in the entire area is excellent. In the first half of this year, the salt fields' sea salt production increased by 68.7% compared to the same period last year. The two salt farms under the jurisdiction of the salt fields have already completed this year's national salt production plan ahead of schedule.

The Liaoning salt fields are one of the largest salt fields in China, with six salt farms distributed along the coast of Liaoning in Luda, Yingkou, and Jinzhou. With the help of the People's Liberation Army, the revolutionary workers of each salt farm have been deeply engaged in revolutionary criticism, vigorously criticizing the series of counter-revolutionary revisionist black goods peddled by Chinese Khrushchev and his agents. Their awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines has greatly increased. They regard the firm implementation of Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production" as an important sign of loyalty to Chairman Mao, loyalty to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyalty to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. This year, the revolutionary workers of the salt fields have carried forward the revolutionary spirit, exerted great efforts, and striven to advance, launching a production upsurge. They have surpassed the level of previous years in terms of dike maintenance and brine cultivation, laying a solid foundation for completing this year's sea salt production tasks.

    辽宁上半年海盐生产大幅度增长
    辽宁盐区广大革命职工，在人民解放军毛泽东思想宣传队的帮助下，狠抓阶级斗争，深入持久地开展革命大批判，全区革命、生产形势一片大好。今年上半年，这个盐区海盐生产比去年同期增长了百分之六十八点七。盐区所属的两个盐场已提前完成全年国家产盐计划。
    辽宁盐区是我国最大盐区之一，共有六个盐场分布在辽宁沿海的旅大、营口和锦州。各个盐场的广大革命职工在人民解放军的帮助下，深入开展革命的大批判，狠狠地批判了中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人所贩卖的一系列反革命修正主义黑货，阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟大大提高。他们把坚决贯彻毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，看作是忠于毛主席，忠于毛泽东思想，忠于毛主席无产阶级革命路线的重要标志。今年，盐区广大革命职工发扬革命精神，鼓足干劲，力争上游，掀起了生产热潮，使修滩养卤超过了往年的水平，为完成今年海盐生产任务打下了良好基础。　　　（据新华社讯）
