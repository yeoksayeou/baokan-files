	Love Reading Chairman Mao's Books, Love Singing Songs Praising Chairman Mao
	—The Story of Malaysian Sailors' Love for the Great Leader Chairman Mao

	Forever Following Chairman Mao

	"Mao Zedong Thought shines brightly,
	Wherever it goes, it brings light,
	The people of the world grasp it,
	Completely liberate themselves and seek emancipation.
	Forever follow Mao Zedong,
	The whole world will be red."

	This is the passionate praise of a Malaysian sailor who traveled to China on a voyage. This sailor was born into a poor peasant family. Since childhood, he has worked on ships and has been a sailor for nearly thirty years, enduring exploitation and humiliation. When he arrived in China with his ship, upon seeing the Chinese port workers, he was like a long-lost relative meeting again, enthusiastically inviting the Chinese comrades to his cabin on the ship. On the wall above his bed hung a portrait of Chairman Mao, and the walls around the cabin were adorned with quotations from Chairman Mao. On the table lay the works of Chairman Mao. In his conversation with the Chinese comrades, he expressed his hatred for the dark society and his yearning for New China.

	When talking about his insights from studying Chairman Mao's brilliant work "Analysis of the Classes in Chinese Society," he said, "After studying this article, I understood the extremely important question of who our enemies are and who our friends are. Chairman Mao's words are all truths. Following Chairman Mao means victory, and mastering Mao Zedong Thought means standing unshakable forever."

	He said, "I will strive to study Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, resolutely oppose imperialism and reactionaries, and fight for the liberation of the Malaysian people!"

	Let More People Study Chairman Mao's Quotations

	One day, on the wall of a foreign ocean-going cargo ship docked in a Chinese port, a beautifully made quotation board appeared, with a quotation from Chairman Mao written in Malay, Chinese, and English: "The people, and the people alone, are the motive force in the making of world history."

	This was made by a Malaysian sailor in his spare time. This sailor said, "I love reading Chairman Mao's books the most and singing songs praising Mao Zedong the most." He expressed his desire "to write Chairman Mao's quotations one by one on the quotation board, so that more people can act according to Chairman Mao's words." He emphasized that as long as one acts according to Mao Zedong Thought, one can achieve victory.

	The Request of Malaysian Workers

	One noon, our port workers boarded a foreign cargo ship that had just entered the port. They were greeted by an old Greek sailor. After shaking hands and exchanging greetings, the old sailor bluntly requested that the Chinese workers give him some Chairman Mao badges. He said that this was a request from Malaysian workers to the Chinese comrades. It turned out that this old Greek sailor had obtained a batch of Chairman Mao badges during his last voyage to Shanghai. After the ship arrived in Malaysia, these badges were all taken by local workers. More Malaysian friends were hoping to obtain precious Chairman Mao badges, and they entrusted this old sailor to convey their love for the great leader of the proletariat, Chairman Mao, to the great Chinese people when he went to China again.

	The old Greek sailor firmly remembered these entrustments. He was afraid of forgetting, so he specially wrote this matter on the first page of his diary and listed it as the first thing to do when he arrived in China.

	Loud Songs Flying to the Distance

	In a Chinese port, as dawn broke, a Chinese port worker was surrounded by more than ten Malaysian sailors working on a foreign cargo ship. They earnestly requested that the Chinese port worker teach them the song "Beijing Has a Golden Sun." A young Malaysian sailor, looking at the red sun rising over the sea, held high a red "Quotations from Chairman Mao," and enthusiastically said to the Chinese comrades, "The sun is Mao Zedong, Chairman Mao is in my heart! Please grant our request!" The Chinese port worker was deeply moved by the deep affection these foreign sailors had for Chairman Mao and readily agreed to their request. The Malaysian sailors learned very seriously. When they learned to sing "Beijing Has a Golden Sun" in Chinese, they were overjoyed, singing and dancing while repeatedly shouting, "The sun is Chairman Mao!" "Long live Chairman Mao!"

	One day, these Malaysian sailors again gathered around the Chinese port worker, asking him to teach them the song "Sailing the Seas Depends on the Helmsman." During their learning process, a Malaysian sailor, while loudly reciting "Resolutely decide, fear no sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory," ran towards them with a stack of papers, giving each person a copy. Everyone carefully looked, and it turned out to be the newly printed Malay version of the song "Sailing the Seas Depends on the Helmsman."

	A few days later, this ocean-going cargo ship set sail, and many Malaysian sailors on the ship left the Chinese port with reluctant hearts. As they raised anchor, they sang excitedly, "Sailing the seas depends on the helmsman, all things grow with the sun... Doing revolution depends on Mao Zedong Thought." The loud songs echoed with the waves, flying to the distance.

### 爱读毛主席的书　爱唱歌颂毛主席的歌——马来亚海员热爱伟大导师毛主席的故事

    爱读毛主席的书　爱唱歌颂毛主席的歌
    ——马来亚海员热爱伟大导师毛主席的故事
    永远跟着毛主席
   “毛泽东思想放光芒，
    照到哪里哪里亮，
    世界人民掌握她，
    彻底翻身谋解放。
    永远跟着毛泽东，
    整个世界红彤彤。”
    这是远航来中国的一位马来亚海员对伟大领袖毛主席的热情歌颂。
    这位海员出生在一个贫苦的农民家里，从小就到船上干活，当了将近三十年的海员，受尽剥削和欺凌。当他随船来到中国时，一见中国的港务人员，就象久别重逢亲人，热情地邀请中国同志到他歇宿的船舱里去作客。在他的铺位的正面挂着毛主席像，舱壁四周挂满了毛主席语录，桌上放着毛主席著作。他在同中国同志谈话中，表示了他对黑暗社会的仇恨和对新中国的向往。
    他在谈到学习毛主席的《中国社会各阶级的分析》这篇光辉著作的心得时说：“学了这篇文章，使我懂得了谁是我们的敌人，谁是我们的朋友这个极为重要的问题。毛主席说的话全是真理，跟着毛主席就是胜利，掌握毛泽东思想就会永远立于不败之地。”
    他说：“我要努力学习毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，坚决反对帝国主义和反动派，为马来亚人民的解放而斗争！”
    让更多的人学习毛主席语录
    一天，一艘停泊在中国港口的外国远洋货轮的舱壁上，出现了一块做得很精致的毛主席语录板，上面分别用马来亚文、中文和英文写着一条毛主席语录：“人民，只有人民，才是创造世界历史的动力。”
    这是一位马来亚海员利用业余时间做的。这位海员说：“我最喜欢读毛主席的书，最爱唱歌颂毛泽东的歌。”他表示“要把毛主席语录一条一条地写在语录板上，让更多的人照毛主席的话去做”。他强调说，只要按毛主席的思想办事就能取得胜利。
    马来亚工人的嘱托
    一天中午，我国港务人员登上一艘进港的外国货船工作，迎面遇上一位希腊老海员。在握手问候之后，这位海员开门见山地要求中国工作人员送给他一些毛主席像章。他说，这是马来亚工人嘱托他向中国同志要的。原来这位希腊老海员在上次航行经过上海时，得到了一批毛主席像章，在轮船到达马来亚后，这些像章全被当地工人索要一空。更多的马来亚朋友都盼望得到宝贵的毛主席像章，他们嘱咐这位老海员再去中国时，一定要向伟大的中国人民转达他们热爱无产阶级的伟大导师毛主席的心情。
    希腊老海员牢牢记住这些嘱托。他怕遗忘，还特地把这件事情记在日记的首页，并把它列为到中国后要办的第一件事。
    嘹亮的歌声飞向远方
    在中国的一个港口，天刚黎明，一位中国港务人员被十几名在一艘外国货轮上工作的马来亚海员团团围住。他们恳切地请求中国港务人员教唱《北京有个金太阳》这首歌。一位年轻的马来亚海员望着海面冉冉升起的红太阳，手里高举红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，热情洋溢地对中国同志说：“太阳就是毛泽东，毛主席就在我心中！请你答应我们这个要求吧！”中国港务人员深为这些外国海员无限热爱毛主席的深厚感情所激动，爽快地答应了他们的要求。马来亚海员们学得十分认真。他们在学会用中文唱《北京有个金太阳》这首歌曲时，高兴极了，连唱带跳地不断高呼：“太阳就是毛主席！”“毛泽东主席万岁！”
    一天，这些马来亚海员又围在中国港务人员身边，请他教唱《大海航行靠舵手》。在他们学唱过程中，一位马来亚海员一面高声朗诵“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”，一面拿着一叠纸朝他们跑来，给每个人发一张。大家仔细一看，原来是刚打印的马来亚文《大海航行靠舵手》的歌片。
    几天后，这艘远洋货轮启航了，船上的许多马来亚海员怀着无限留恋的心情离开中国海港。他们一边起锚，一边激动地唱起了“大海航行靠舵手，万物生长靠太阳……干革命靠的是毛泽东思想。”嘹亮的歌声随着海浪激荡，飞向远方。
