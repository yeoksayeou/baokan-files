In the mass movement of establishing Mao Zedong Thought study classes, the North Gate Brigade of Chengguan Commune in Luancheng County, Hebei Province, with the help of PLA agricultural support personnel, has promoted Chairman Mao's advocacy of the revolutionary learning style of combining theory with practice. They have adopted the method of "study, expose, criticize, and reform" to actively apply Mao Zedong Thought, earnestly implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and promote the victorious development of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, making the study classes increasingly consolidated and improved.

The North Gate Brigade began establishing various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes as early as last October, following Chairman Mao's instructions. However, due to a lack of experience, they initially adopted the method of giving large lectures, where one lecture was followed by a discussion, resulting in a loose connection between thought and reality and limited effectiveness. The brigade leadership and PLA comrades organized relevant personnel to study this issue. Everyone agreed that the reason the study classes were not successful was mainly the failure to fully implement Chairman Mao's long-standing advocacy of the revolutionary learning style of combining theory with practice. After identifying the cause, the brigade leadership and PLA comrades organized poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres to study Vice Chairman Lin's instructions on "studying Chairman Mao's works, learning with questions in mind, actively applying what is learned, combining learning with use, learning what is urgently needed first, seeing immediate results, and focusing on the 'use' aspect." They strove to achieve a combination of learning and application. After several months of effort, they have found a way to actively apply Mao Zedong Thought and implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions through the method of "study, expose, criticize, and reform."

Study means following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment to study Chairman Mao's works and his latest instructions, arming cadres and the masses with Mao Zedong Thought.

Expose means organizing cadres and the masses to focus on key issues, thoroughly exposing the cover-ups of the struggles between the two classes, two roads, two lines, and two ideologies, bringing out the contradictions.

Criticize means using the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to launch a revolutionary criticism, eliminating the poisonous influence of the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of the Chinese Khrushchev. For internal errors and shortcomings, they are resolved through self-criticism and criticism during the revolutionary criticism. In this way, the struggle against self and the struggle against revisionism are closely combined.

Reform means, through revolutionary criticism, breaking away from the old thoughts and institutions of the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes, and establishing new thoughts and institutions of the proletariat.

The cadres and masses of the North Gate Brigade have found that using this method to actively apply Mao Zedong Thought has the following advantages: closely following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, actively studying Chairman Mao's works and his latest instructions, clearly understanding the problems of the brigade, deeply criticizing the counter-revolutionary revisionist line, and quickly correcting shortcomings and errors.

When using this learning method, the brigade arranges what to study, what to expose, what to criticize, and what to reform in each period according to the actual situation of the brigade. They also help various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes in each production team to clarify the direction, grasp the key points, and closely combine them with the actual class struggle, production struggle, and thoughts of the commune members in their units, achieving targeted results. Since the spring, they have used this method to hold study classes, achieving remarkable results in solving important issues such as revolutionary unity, the three-in-one combination, establishing and consolidating the leadership cadre, closely connecting with the masses, and actively attacking class enemies.

Initially, the leading cadres of the Second Production Team were not united for a long time due to class enemies stirring up trouble. When the team first held study classes, they did not connect learning with reality, did not expose the cover-up of class struggle, and the unity issue was not resolved. Later, they adopted the method of "study, expose, criticize, and reform." First, they studied Chairman Mao's teachings on class and class struggle with questions in mind, engaged in reminiscing about bitterness and sweetness, raised class struggle awareness, and then held large-scale discussions on the topic of "Why is the leading cadre not united?" They exposed the troublemakers, making the broad poor and lower-middle peasants and cadres see clearly. The cadres influenced by the troublemakers deeply examined themselves for being poisoned by the "theory of the extinction of class struggle" of the Chinese Khrushchev. Later, the cadres of this production team remembered Chairman Mao's teaching of "never forget class struggle," always maintained high revolutionary vigilance, stood at the forefront of class struggle, strengthened unity among themselves, and worked together to grasp power for the poor and lower-middle peasants. The cadres and masses said: Such study classes are well-organized.

After Chairman Mao issued the latest instruction that "the basic experience of the revolutionary committee has three points: one is the representative of revolutionary cadres, one is the representative of the army, and one is the representative of revolutionary masses, realizing the three-in-one combination. The revolutionary committee should implement unified leadership, break down the overlapping administrative organs, streamline administration, and organize a revolutionary leadership cadre that is connected with the masses," the leadership cadre of the North Gate Brigade, with the help of PLA agricultural support personnel, promptly led all cadres to hold a study class to implement this latest instruction from Chairman Mao. They mobilized the masses to give suggestions to the leadership cadre, criticized the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of the Chinese Khrushchev in power construction, and formulated ten regulations to closely connect with the masses and grasp power for the poor and lower-middle peasants. They implemented these regulations in earnest, promoting the revolutionization of the leadership cadre and receiving warm praise from the commune members.

After Chairman Mao issued the latest instruction that "the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is essentially a political revolution of the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes under socialist conditions, a continuation of the long-term struggle between the Communist Party of China and its led broad revolutionary people and the Kuomintang reactionaries, and a continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie," the leadership cadre of the North Gate Brigade, with the help of PLA agricultural support personnel, immediately organized field and household study classes to seriously study this latest instruction. They organized poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres to recall the history of the struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines in the brigade over the past twenty years since liberation, and seriously analyzed the new trends and characteristics of the current class struggle, further raising the awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines among cadres and the masses, and launching a fierce attack on class enemies.

The North Gate Brigade's use of the learning method of "study, expose, criticize, and reform" has made theory closely combined with practice, and various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes are increasingly successful. Over the past half year, they have held study classes during both slack and busy farming seasons, with every household participating. The invincible Mao Zedong Thought has been widely popularized. The broad poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres, following Chairman Mao's teachings, have grasped revolution and promoted production, achieving an unprecedented bumper harvest of wheat this year, and the autumn crops are also growing well.

    发扬毛主席倡导的理论联系实际学风
    北关大队毛泽东思想学习班越办越好
    学习班紧密结合实际，活学活用毛泽东思想，认真落实毛主席最新指示，收到显著效果
    新华社石家庄二十一日电　在大办毛泽东思想学习班的群众运动中，河北省栾城县城关公社北关大队在人民解放军支农人员帮助下，发扬毛主席倡导的理论联系实际的革命好学风，采取一学二揭三批四改的方法，活学活用毛泽东思想，认真落实毛主席的最新指示，推动了无产阶级文化大革命胜利发展，使学习班不断巩固和提高。
    北关大队早在去年十月份就根据毛主席的办学习班的指示，举办各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班。但是，当时由于缺乏经验，采取了上大课的方法，讲一课，讨论一课，联系思想、联系实际不紧密，效果不大。大队领导班子和解放军同志组织有关人员研究了这个问题。大家都说，学习班没有办好的原因，主要是没有很好地贯彻毛主席历来倡导的理论联系实际的革命好学风。原因找到后，大队领导班子和解放军同志组织贫下中农、革命干部学习了林副主席关于
  “学习毛主席著作，要带着问题学，活学活用，学用结合，急用先学，立竿见影，在‘用’字上狠下功夫”的指示，努力做到学用结合。经过几个月的努力，他们已经摸索出一条一学二揭三批四改，活学活用毛泽东思想，落实毛主席最新指示的路子。
    学，就是紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，学习毛主席著作和毛主席的最新指示，用毛泽东思想武装干部和群众。
    揭，就是组织干部和群众围绕着要解决的重点问题，大揭两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线和两种思想斗争的盖子，把矛盾揭露出来。
    批，就是以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，展开革命的大批判，肃清中国赫鲁晓夫反革命修正主义路线的流毒。对人民内部的错误缺点，在革命大批判中，通过亮私斗私，开展批评和自我批评来解决。这样，把斗私和批修紧密结合起来。
    改，就是通过革命大批判，破资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的旧思想，旧制度，立无产阶级的新思想，新制度。
    北关大队的干部和群众体会到，用这种方法活学活用毛泽东思想，好处是：对毛主席的伟大战略部署跟得紧，对毛主席著作和毛主席的最新指示学得活，对本大队的问题看得清，对反革命修正主义路线批得深，对缺点和错误改得快。
    这个大队在运用这种学习方法的时候，每个时期学习什么，揭露什么，批判什么，改革什么，都根据本大队的实际情况，作出安排，并且尽量帮助各生产队的各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，明确方向，抓住重点，和本单位的阶级斗争、生产斗争、社员思想实际紧密结合起来，做到有的放矢。从春季以来，他们用这种方法办学习班，在解决革命大联合、革命三结合、建立和巩固领导班子、密切联系群众、主动向阶级敌人进攻等重要问题方面，都已收到显著的效果。
    第二生产队领导干部之间过去长期不团结，原因是有阶级敌人从中挑拨。起初二队干部办学习班时，由于学习不联系实际，没有揭开阶级斗争的盖子，团结问题也没有得到解决。后来，他们采用一学二揭三批四改的方法，首先带着问题，学习了毛主席有关阶级和阶级斗争的教导，进行忆苦思甜，提高阶级斗争觉悟，然后以“领导班子为什么不团结”为题，进行大揭大议，揪出了在背后捣鬼的坏人，使广大贫下中农和干部擦亮了眼睛。受了坏人影响的干部，痛心地检查了自己中了中国赫鲁晓夫“阶级斗争熄灭”论的毒害。以后，这个生产队的干部牢记毛主席的“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的教导，时刻提高革命警惕性，站在阶级斗争的最前列，互相之间加强了团结，齐心协力为贫下中农掌好权、用好权。干部和群众都说：这样的学习班办得好。
    毛主席发出“革命委员会的基本经验有三条：一条是有革命干部的代表，一条是有军队的代表，一条是有革命群众的代表，实现了革命的三结合。革命委员会要实行一元化的领导，打破重叠的行政机构，精兵简政，组织起一个革命化的联系群众的领导班子”的最新指示以后，北关大队领导班子就在解放军支农人员的帮助下，及时地领导全体干部办了落实毛主席这一最新指示的学习班。他们发动群众给领导班子提意见，针对当时存在的问题，狠批了中国赫鲁晓夫在政权建设方面推行的反革命修正主义路线。他们遵照毛主席的最新指示，制订了密切联系群众，为贫下中农掌好权、用好权的十项规定，切实执行，促进了领导班子的革命化，受到了社员群众的热烈赞扬。
    毛主席关于“无产阶级文化大革命，实质上是在社会主义条件下，无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命，是中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续，是无产阶级和资产阶级阶级斗争的继续”的最新指示发表以后，北关大队领导班子又在解放军支农人员的帮助下，立即发动田间地头学习班和三家两户学习班认真地学习了这一最新指示，组织贫下中农和革命干部回忆了解放二十年来本大队两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争的历史，认真分析当前阶级斗争的新动向、新特点，进一步提高了干部和群众的阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟，向阶级敌人展开了猛烈进攻。
    北关大队采用一学二揭三批四改的学习方法，使理论密切联系实际，各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班越办越好。半年多以来，农闲办，农忙办，家家户户都坚持办，战无不胜的毛泽东思想空前大普及。广大贫下中农和革命干部遵照毛主席的教导，抓革命，促生产，使今年的小麦获得了空前大丰收，大秋作物也长得很好。
