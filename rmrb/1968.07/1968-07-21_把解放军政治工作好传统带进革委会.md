The chairman of the revolutionary committee of the Shahe Town Central Station of the Dandong Railway Bureau of Liaoning Province, military representative Comrade Pu Qingping, moved into the collective dormitory of the workers on the very first day he arrived at the station. He slept on the same kang (brick bed) as the workers, ate from the same pot, worked, studied, and engaged in self-criticism and criticism of revisionism together. Old Pu treated the station as his own home and regarded all revolutionary workers as his own family. He often went deep into the work units, talked with the masses, and did ideological and political work. The workers were all willing to talk to him. At the beginning, some comrades saw that he did not focus on specific business work and were a bit worried: "Can the tasks be completed this way?" Old Pu, however, learned from his interactions with the masses that some workers had ideological burdens. He thought: "Among countless things, we must grasp the root. If these ideological problems are not solved and ideological awareness is not raised, the work will not be done well, and the tasks will not be completed." When he learned that a leader in a certain station had not been able to think clearly due to criticism from the masses, had become hesitant in his work, and thought that a small station had no future, so he did not want to work anymore. Old Pu had several heart-to-heart talks with him, seriously and warmly saying: "In the old society, we were all sufferers. In the old society, the poor could only be beasts of burden. Who had ever heard of the poor holding power? If we do not hold power well, we will go back to the old ways and suffer twice. The revolution cannot be half-hearted!" This cadre listened and reflected, comparing Old Pu's words with his own wrong thoughts, deeply feeling that he had let Chairman Mao down. Finally, he said with a smile: "I've thought it through. Watch my actions from now on." After this cadre returned to his unit, he actively engaged in self-criticism in a mass meeting, deeply criticized his private thoughts, and gained the understanding of the masses. From then on, the cadres and workers in this station united as one, wholeheartedly engaged in the revolution, and the revolution and production presented a new situation.

After Comrade Pu Qingping arrived at the station, he insisted on holding Mao Zedong Thought study classes. At the beginning, some comrades emphasized that business work was busy and thought that not many people could be spared. Pu Qingping organized the members of the revolutionary committee to discuss the great significance of holding study classes and mobilized the masses to discuss. As a result, work was properly arranged, and the number of people participating in the study increased by one fold compared to the original plan, and the number of people participating in the study increased with each session.

When dealing with business issues, Comrade Pu Qingping also guided the members of the revolutionary committee to adhere to the "Four Firsts" and do good ideological work. Once, during the shunting operation at the station, a switchman made a mistake, almost causing a serious accident. The person involved was afraid of being criticized or punished and dared not take responsibility, so the problem was not clarified, the responsibility was not determined, and the lesson was not found. Some comrades then proposed to punish the switchman on duty. Comrade Pu Qingping did not agree with this opinion. He suggested that the revolutionary committee hold a meeting with the relevant personnel for discussion. At the meeting, Pu Qingping first made self-criticism, saying: "Although the problem occurred below, as the main responsible person of the revolutionary committee, I lacked supervision and inspection in my daily work, and I did not educate and help my comrades enough, so the problem that could have been avoided occurred. I should take the primary responsibility first." Then, committee member Liu Fucheng stood up to check himself, saying: "I am the committee member in charge of business. The main reason is that I did not fulfill my responsibility..." Because the leaders took the initiative to take responsibility, many comrades related to this matter also took the initiative to check themselves. At this time, the switchmen Xiao Wang and Xiao Yang could no longer suppress their inner uneasiness, and they deeply checked their mistakes. The meeting achieved good results: not only was the problem clarified, the lesson was found, but also all committee members and workers received a profound education. The workers praised Old Pu for bringing the good traditions of the PLA's political work into the revolutionary committee.

    把解放军政治工作好传统带进革委会
    辽宁省丹东铁路分局沙河镇中心车站革命委员会主任、军队代表蒲清萍同志，来到车站的第一天，就住进了职工集体宿舍，与职工同睡一铺炕，同吃一锅饭，同劳动，同学习，在一起斗私批修。老蒲把车站当成自己的家，把广大革命职工看作自己的亲人。他经常深入班组，找群众谈心，做思想政治工作，广大职工有话都愿意跟他讲。开始，有的同志看他不去具体抓业务工作，有些担心：“这样搞下去，任务能完成吗？”老蒲呢，他从接触群众中了解到，有些职工有思想包袱。他就琢磨：千头万绪要抓住根本，群众的这些思想问题不解决，思想觉悟不提高，工作就搞不好，任务也完不成。当他了解到某站一个领导干部，由于受到群众批评而思想不通，工作缩手缩脚，并认为小车站前途不大，所以不想干了。老蒲就多次找他谈心，严肃而又热情地对他说：“我们在旧社会都是受苦人。在旧社会，穷人只能作牛马，那有穷人掌权的？有权要想到无权的苦，如果我们不掌好权，就会走回头路，吃二遍苦。革命不能半途而废啊！”这个干部边听边沉思，把老蒲讲的道理，同自己的错误思想一对比，深深感到对不起毛主席。最后，他爽朗地说：“我想通了，今后看我的行动吧。”这个干部回到本单位以后，主动在群众大会上狠斗私心，猛触灵魂，取得了群众谅解。从此，这个站干群一条心，齐心闹革命，革命和生产出现崭新的局面。
    蒲清萍同志来到车站以后，就坚持办毛泽东思想学习班。开始，有的同志强调业务工作忙，认为抽不出多少人来，蒲清萍就组织革委会成员讨论办学习班的伟大意义，并且发动群众讨论。结果，妥善安排了工作，使参加学习的人数比预计的增加了一倍，而且参加学习的人一期比一期多。
    在处理业务问题的时候，蒲清萍同志也注意引导革委会成员坚持“四个第一”，做好思想工作。一次，车站进行调车作业，扳道工人扳错了道岔，几乎造成严重的事故。当事人怕受批评或处分，不敢承担责任，以致问题没有弄清，责任没有查明，教训没有找到。有的同志便提议处分值班的扳道工人。蒲清萍同志没有同意这个意见。他建议革委会召开有关人员的会议进行讨论。会上，蒲清萍同志首先作了自我批评，他说：“问题虽然发生在下边，但作为革委会的主要负责人，平时缺乏督促检查，对同志们教育帮助也不够，使得本来可以避免的问题发生了，我要首先负责任。”接着，革委会委员刘福成同志站起来检查说：“我是革委会分管业务的委员，主要是我没有尽到责任……。”由于领导主动承担责任，不少和这件事有关的同志也都主动作了检查，这时，当事人扳道工小王和小杨再也按捺不住内心的不安，他们沉痛地检查了自己的错误。会议收到了良好效果：不仅弄清了问题，找出了教训，而且使全体委员和职工受到了一次深刻的教育。广大职工称赞老蒲把解放军政治工作的好传统带进了革委会。
