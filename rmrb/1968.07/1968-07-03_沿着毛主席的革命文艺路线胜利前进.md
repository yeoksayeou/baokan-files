On July 1, the great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin attended a gala celebrating the 47th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China, watching and listening to the newly created piano accompaniment to "The Red Lantern" and the revolutionary modern symphony "Sha Jianhuai" during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. After the performance, they walked onto the stage and had a cordial meeting with all the performers, which is the greatest concern, encouragement, and spur for us revolutionary literary and artistic workers. We feel extremely happy, excited, and invigorated. We sincerely wish the great leader Chairman Mao eternal life!

The piano accompaniment to "The Red Lantern," jointly performed by the Central Orchestra and the Beijing Opera Troupe, was created under the brilliant guidance of Chairman Mao's proletarian literary and artistic line, implementing Chairman Mao's policy of "using Western art for Chinese purposes and innovating," and following the instructions of Comrade Jiang Qing. This is a new achievement in the field of literature and art during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and a tribute to the 47th anniversary of the founding of our Party!

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Our literature and art belong to the people, first of all to the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and are created for the workers, peasants, and soldiers and used by them." This is the fundamental direction of proletarian revolutionary literature and art.

In the past, a handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists in the literary and artistic circles, using the leadership positions they had usurped, fiercely opposed Chairman Mao's revolutionary literary and artistic line, promoting a counter-revolutionary revisionist black line in literature and art, attempting to turn literature and art into a tool to subvert the dictatorship of the proletariat and restore capitalism. Therefore, the new proletarian literature and art—the revolutionary modern symphony "Sha Jianhuai"—was born in the fierce struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines.

With China's Khrushchev as the mastermind, a handful of traitors, spies, die-hard capitalist-roaders, and various counter-revolutionaries, extremely hated the revolutionary modern symphony "Sha Jianhuai." They used every vile means to slander and deny it, attempting to destroy this new revolutionary thing. In this sharp struggle, our beloved Comrade Jiang Qing, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, bravely defended Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary literary and artistic line, leading us proletarian revolutionary literary and artistic workers to launch a fierce attack on the counter-revolutionary revisionist black line in literature and art of China's Khrushchev. Comrade Jiang Qing's series of instructions on the revolution of symphonic music gave us boundless strength. After repeated struggles, the revolutionary symphony "Sha Jianhuai," a model revolutionary opera shining with the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought, was finally born. It swept away the stale air of "emphasizing the past and neglecting the present, the dead and neglecting the living" on the symphonic stage, opening up a new path for symphonic music to serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers and proletarian politics.

The piano accompaniment to "The Red Lantern" was also born in the fierce struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines.

In 1964, Comrade Jiang Qing, following Chairman Mao's brilliant instruction of "using the past for the present and using Western art for Chinese purposes," wanted the piano to accompany revolutionary modern Beijing opera. However, the mastermind of the counter-revolutionary revisionist black line in literature and art and his agents in our troupe paid lip service but acted to the contrary, imposing a blockade, making this important instruction unable to meet the revolutionary literary and artistic workers for a long time. The great proletarian cultural revolution thoroughly smashed this handful of class enemies' evil plots. Under the inspiring situation of the great proletarian cultural revolution, the revolutionary literary and artistic workers of the Central Orchestra and the Beijing Opera Troupe broke away from superstition, displayed great daring and pioneering spirit, and the courage to think, to do, and to make revolution. After repeated practices, they jointly created the piano accompaniment to "The Red Lantern," making the Western instrument piano appear on the Beijing opera stage for the first time. The piano accompaniment to "The Red Lantern" not only retains the basic characteristics of Beijing opera singing but also fully utilizes the piano's wide range, majestic momentum, and rich expressiveness, better highlighting and shaping the heroic images of Li Yuhe and Li Tiemei. Therefore, it has been highly praised by the leading comrades of the Party Central Committee and the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, who consider it a new creation and new variety in proletarian revolutionary literature and art, opening up a new path for Western instruments and symphonic music, and for the accompaniment of our great motherland's drama. It fully demonstrates the great vitality of proletarian revolutionary new literature and art and once again shows the invincible power of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary literary and artistic line!

Through the great proletarian cultural revolution, the class consciousness and two-line struggle consciousness of the broad revolutionary literary and artistic workers in our troupe have been greatly enhanced. We must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, do a good job in cleaning up the class ranks, and carry out a thorough and sustained revolutionary criticism. Like Guo Jian'guang, A Qing, and Sha Nainai in "Sha Jianhuai"; like Li Yuhe, Li Tiemei, and Li Nainai in "The Red Lantern," we will wage a resolute, brave, and tenacious struggle against all class enemies. We must, in the fierce flames of class struggle, build a strong new army of proletarian literature and art, and achieve new victories for the development of proletarian literature and art in our country!

    沿着毛主席的革命文艺路线胜利前进
    中央乐团革命委员会
    七月一日，伟大领袖毛主席和他的亲密战友林副主席，出席了庆祝中国共产党成立四十七周年晚会，观看和聆听在无产阶级文化大革命中新创作的钢琴伴唱《红灯记》以及交响音乐《沙家浜》，并且在演出结束时走上舞台，同我们参加演出的全体演员亲切见面，这是对我们革命文艺战士的最大关怀，最大鼓舞，最大鞭策；我们感到无比的幸福、激动和振奋，我们衷心地祝愿伟大领袖毛主席万寿无疆，万寿无疆！
    我们中央乐团和中国京剧团革命文艺战士联合演出的钢琴伴唱《红灯记》，是在伟大领袖毛主席的无产阶级文艺路线的光辉照耀下，贯彻执行毛主席“洋为中用、推陈出新”的方针，根据江青同志的指示新近创作出来的。这是无产阶级文化大革命中文艺战线上的新的成果，也是我们革命的文艺战士向党的四十七周年生日的献礼！
    毛主席教导我们：“我们的文学艺术都是为人民大众的，首先是为工农兵的，为工农兵而创作，为工农兵所利用的。”这是无产阶级革命文艺的根本方向。
    过去，文艺界的一小撮反革命修正主义分子，利用他们所窃取的领导权，疯狂对抗毛主席的革命文艺路线，推行了一条反革命修正主义文艺黑线，妄图把文艺变成颠覆无产阶级专政、复辟资本主义的工具。因此，无产阶级的新文艺——革命现代交响音乐《沙家浜》，是在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的激烈斗争中诞生的。
    以中国赫鲁晓夫为总后台的一小撮叛徒、特务、顽固不化的走资派和形形色色的反革命分子，对革命现代交响音乐《沙家浜》极端仇恨，他们耍尽各种卑劣手段，诽谤它、否定它，妄图把这一革命的新生事物置于死地。在这场尖锐的斗争中，我们敬爱的江青同志，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，英勇地捍卫毛主席的无产阶级革命文艺路线，率领我们无产阶级革命文艺战士，向中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义文艺黑线展开了猛烈的进攻。江青同志关于交响音乐革命的一系列指示，给了我们无限的力量。经过一次又一次的斗争，革命交响音乐《沙家浜》这一闪耀着毛泽东思想光辉的革命样板戏终于诞生了。它一扫交响音乐舞台上厚古薄今、厚死薄生的恶浊空气，开辟了交响音乐为工农兵服务，为无产阶级政治服务的新道路。
    钢琴伴唱《红灯记》也是在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的激烈斗争中诞生的。
    一九六四年，江青同志根据毛主席“古为今用，洋为中用”的光辉指示，要钢琴为革命现代京剧伴唱。但是，反革命修正主义文艺黑线总后台及其在我团的代理人却阳奉阴违，横加封锁，使这一重要指示迟迟不能和革命文艺战士见面。轰轰烈烈的无产阶级文化大革命，彻底粉碎了这一小撮阶级敌人的罪恶阴谋。在无产阶级文化大革命的大好形势的鼓舞下，我们中央乐团和中国京剧团的革命文艺战士，破除迷信，发挥了大无畏的革命首创精神和敢想、敢干、敢革命的英勇气概，经过反复实践，终于联合创作了钢琴伴唱《红灯记》，使钢琴这一西洋乐器第一次登上了京剧舞台。钢琴伴唱《红灯记》，既保留了京剧唱腔的基本特点，又充分发挥了钢琴音域宽广、气势雄伟、富于表现力的特色，更好地烘托和塑造了李玉和、李铁梅高大的英雄形象。因而得到了党中央的领导同志和广大工农兵群众的高度评价，认为这是无产阶级革命文艺的新创作、新品种，为西洋乐器和交响乐开辟了一条新道路，为我们伟大祖国的戏剧伴奏开辟了一条新道路。它充分地表现了无产阶级革命新文艺的强大生命力，又一次显示了毛主席无产阶级革命文艺路线的无比威力！
    通过无产阶级文化大革命，我团广大革命文艺战士的阶级觉悟和两条路线斗争觉悟空前提高。我们一定要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，做好清理阶级队伍的工作，深入持久地开展革命大批判。象《沙家浜》中的郭建光、阿庆嫂、沙奶奶那样；象《红灯记》中的李玉和、李铁梅、李奶奶那样，对一切阶级敌人展开坚决、勇敢、顽强的斗争。我们一定要在阶级斗争的烈火中，树立起一支坚强的无产阶级的文艺新军，为发展我国无产阶级文艺立新功！
