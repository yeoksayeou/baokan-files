The National Liberation Front of South Vietnam strongly condemns the U.S. imperialists' persistent strengthening and expansion of the war of aggression against Vietnam. It calls on the people to firmly grasp their weapons and continue the fight to defeat the U.S. imperialists.

New China News Agency, Hanoi, July 22 — According to a report by the Liberation News Agency of South Vietnam, on July 14, the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam issued a statement on the 14th anniversary of the signing of the Geneva Agreements on the Vietnam issue. The statement strongly condemns the U.S. imperialists' persistent strengthening and expansion of the war of aggression against Vietnam and calls on the people of South Vietnam to continue the fight until the final victory of the anti-U.S. national salvation war. The following is an excerpt from the statement:

The Vietnamese people and the people of Indochina, through their struggles against colonialist aggressors and the thwarting of the U.S. war-mongering clique's schemes to prolong and expand the war in Indochina, have achieved tremendous victories. The people of South Vietnam should have enjoyed independence and peace, the Vietnamese people's homeland should have been unified, and the situation in Vietnam should have developed in a way that satisfies the wishes of the people of Vietnam, Indochina, Southeast Asia, and the world.

However, U.S. imperialism has violated the Geneva Agreements, set up an extremely brutal puppet regime in South Vietnam, and used force and various fascist methods to eliminate all patriotic forces and brutally suppress the people's movement in South Vietnam for peace and national reunification. Since 1961, U.S. imperialism has launched a "special war" in South Vietnam.

After the failure of the "special war," since 1965, U.S. imperialism has launched a "limited war," sending a large number of U.S. expeditionary forces to South Vietnam, using aircraft, warships, and various modern weapons to slaughter the people of South Vietnam and commit heinous crimes. Since 1964-1965, U.S. imperialism has also used its air force and navy to wage a savage and destructive war against North Vietnam. The war of aggression that U.S. imperialism is waging in Vietnam is the most brutal war of aggression in history.

The iron-clad facts of the past 14 years have shown that U.S. imperialism is the aggressor in South Vietnam, the destroyer of Vietnam's independence, peace, and unity, the violator of the 1954 Geneva Agreements, the destroyer of the peace, security, and independence of the peoples of Indochina, and a threat to peace in Asia and the world.

The war of aggression launched by U.S. imperialism has deprived the people of South Vietnam of their independence and freedom and injured the most sacred wishes and feelings of every Vietnamese. The people of South Vietnam have no choice but to rise up and fight, resist aggression, and wage a war of resistance to save the motherland and reclaim national independence and sovereignty.

Under the glorious banner of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, the people of South Vietnam have consecutively thwarted all the vicious and extremely brutal schemes and plans of U.S. imperialism's aggression.

At present, the failure of the United States is obvious. But it has not given up its aggressive ambitions and continues to send more U.S. expeditionary forces to South Vietnam, increasing the total number of U.S. troops in Vietnam to nearly 540,000, and continues to coerce its vassal states to provide more cannon fodder. It also orders the puppet regime to implement "total mobilization," intensifying the search for cannon fodder, increasing the total number of puppet troops to 800,000 by the end of this year. It strengthens the use of B-52 bombers and chemical poisons, savagely killing innocent people. It concentrates and brutally bombs and attacks important parts of the territory of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. It is clear that the United States talks about "peace," but in fact, it is strengthening the war of aggression. The crimes it commits against the people of North and South Vietnam are increasing day by day.

The people of South Vietnam love peace very much, but this must be a peace based on independence and freedom. The people of South Vietnam and the people's liberation armed forces will spare no effort to reclaim their national rights—independence, democracy, neutrality, and prosperity. Their determination to peacefully reunify the motherland is unshakable; no brutal force, no reactionary force, and no cunning means can stop the people of South Vietnam from bravely advancing to seize the final victory. As long as U.S. imperialism does not stop the war of aggression against South Vietnam, does not withdraw all U.S. troops and their mercenary troops from South Vietnam, and does not dismantle the U.S. military bases in South Vietnam, allowing the people of South Vietnam to resolve their internal affairs without foreign interference, the people of South Vietnam will continue to fight with their weapons until the final victory.

    越南南方民族解放阵线强烈谴责美帝顽固地加强和扩大侵越战争
    号召人民紧握枪杆坚持战斗打败美帝
    新华社河内二十二日电　据越南南方解放通讯社报道：越南南方民族解放阵线十四日就关于越南问题的日内瓦协议签订十四周年发表一项声明，强烈谴责美帝国主义顽固地加强和扩大侵略越南的战争，号召越南南方人民坚持战斗，直到取得抗美救国战争的最后胜利。声明摘要如下：
    越南人民和印度支那人民经过反对殖民主义侵略者和挫败美国好战集团延长和扩大印度支那战争的阴谋的斗争，取得了巨大的胜利。越南南方人民本应享有独立和平，越南人民的祖国本应得到统一，越南局势本应获得良好的能以满足越南、印度支那、东南亚和全世界人民的愿望的发展。
    但是，美帝国主义却破坏了日内瓦协议，在越南南方拼凑了一个极其残暴的傀儡政权，疯狂使用武力和各种法西斯手段，来消灭各种爱国力量和血腥镇压越南南方争取和平与统一祖国的群众运动。从一九六一年起，美帝国主义在越南南方发动了“特种战争”。
  “特种战争”失败之后，从一九六五年起，美帝国主义又发动了“局部战争”，大规模地向越南南方派遣美国远征军，使用飞机、军舰和各种新式武器，屠杀越南南方人民，犯下了滔天罪行。从一九六四——一九六五年以来，美帝国主义还使用空军和海军，对越南北方进行了野蛮的破坏性战争。美帝国主义正在越南进行的侵略战争，是历史上最残暴的一场侵略战争。
    十四年来的铁的事实表明：美帝国主义是越南南方的侵略者，是越南的独立、和平与统一的破坏者，是一九五四年日内瓦协议的破坏者，是印度支那各民族的和平、安全与独立的破坏者，是亚洲和世界和平的威胁者。
    美帝国主义发动的侵略战争，夺去了越南南方人民的独立和自由，伤害了每一个越南人的最神圣的愿望和情感。越南南方人民除了奋起斗争，抵抗侵略，进行抗战，以拯救祖国和夺回民族的独立和主权而外，别无它路可走。
    越南南方人民在越南南方民族解放阵线的光辉旗帜指引下，接连挫败了美帝国主义的一切恶毒和极端残暴的侵略阴谋和计划。
    目前，美国的失败是明显的了。但它尚未放弃侵略野心，仍然继续向越南南方增派美国远征军，把侵越美军总数增加到近五十四万人，并且继续胁迫它的仆从国为它提供更多的炮灰。它还下令伪政权实行
  “总动员”，加紧搜罗炮灰，使伪军总数在今年年底增加到八十万。它加强使用B—52型飞机和化学毒药，野蛮杀害无辜人民。它集中和残酷地轰炸、袭击越南民主共和国的重要的一部分领土。很明显，美国口谈“和平”，但实际上仍在加强侵略战争。它对越南南北两方人民犯下的罪行正在与日俱增。
    越南南方人民十分热爱和平，但这必须是在独立和自由基础上的和平。越南南方人民和人民解放武装力量不惜一切代价夺回他们的民族权利——独立、民主、中立和繁荣，他们和平统一祖国的决心，是不可动摇的；任何残暴力量、任何反动势力和任何狡猾手段，都不能阻止越南南方人民奋勇前进去夺取最后胜利。只要美帝国主义没有停止侵略越南南方的战争，没有把美军及其帮凶军全部撤出越南南方和撤除美国在越南南方的军事基地，让越南南方人民在没有外国干涉的情况下自己解决越南南方的内部事务，越南南方人民就要紧握枪杆继续战斗，直到最后胜利。
