The Niu Xintai Coal Mine of Benxi Mining Bureau in Liaoning Province, with the help of the People's Liberation Army's Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team, has implemented Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production." By focusing on class struggle, the mine has been built and production has been developed, resulting in a new leap forward in both revolution and production.

Continuing to Focus on Class Struggle to Consolidate and Develop Victories

Last year, Niu Xintai Coal Mine was the first in the city to establish a revolutionary committee and completed the annual coal production task 20 days ahead of schedule. This year, it completed the first quarter's production task 8 days ahead of schedule, receiving multiple commendations from higher-level leadership. In this favorable situation, some cadres and workers thought: "We are like a window blowing a trumpet—our reputation is known far and wide. To maintain our reputation, we must focus on production." Under this influence, the mine once experienced a period of focusing solely on production while neglecting the struggle against the enemy.

The revolutionary committee of the mine and the comrades from the PLA propaganda team held a Mao Zedong Thought study class to address this issue. They organized relevant cadres to study Chairman Mao's writings on political work and his latest instructions. Chairman Mao personally chaired the formulation of the "Sixteen Points," which states: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a powerful driving force for the development of social productive forces in our country. It is wrong to oppose the Cultural Revolution with production development." Through repeated study and discussion, everyone deeply realized that focusing solely on production without first focusing on revolution is extremely wrong. If this continues, people will not see class struggle, and over time, they will slip onto the capitalist road. Everyone also realized that to maintain the mine's original reputation by focusing solely on business is due to some comrades still having the mindset of seeking fame and awards, which shows that the poison of China's Khrushchev is still far from being eliminated in the mine.

Next, the members of the revolutionary committee summarized the mine's experience in focusing on revolution and promoting production in the previous period. They further realized that only by following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, continuing to firmly grasp class struggle, and constantly raising the awareness of class struggle and the two-line struggle among the broad revolutionary workers, can victories be consolidated and developed, production be raised to a new level, and a new socialist mine be built. From the perspective of the two-line struggle, they analyzed the purely business viewpoint and the mindset of seeking fame and awards, believing that this is essentially a reflection of the revisionist road of building mines through business. The new revolutionary committee must not take this old road but must lead the revolutionary masses to take the road of building mines through politics. Based on this heightened awareness, the members of the revolutionary committee severely criticized China's Khrushchev's reactionary fallacies of "business first" and the "other major capitalist roader within the party" who said, "It doesn't matter whether the cat is black or white, as long as it catches mice, it's a good cat," and eliminated the revisionist poison they spread.

Moving the Study Class to the Front Line of Class Struggle

The revolutionary committee and the propaganda team moved the study class to the front line of class struggle and production struggle. They went to the clay pit and, together with the broad revolutionary masses, studied Chairman Mao's teachings on "never forgetting class struggle" and analyzed and researched new issues, new trends, and new characteristics of class struggle. Recently, when the entire mine's revolutionary workers were striving to achieve high production, a counter-revolutionary element took the opportunity to sabotage production and did many bad things. This time, they exposed this bad element and, from this living example of class struggle, saw more clearly the danger of focusing solely on production without emphasizing proletarian politics, and understood more deeply that class struggle must never be relaxed, otherwise, the fundamentals will be forgotten.

The revolutionary committee took the clay pit as a typical example to further promote the struggle against the enemy throughout the mine area. The broad revolutionary workers exposed, criticized, and struggled against the various crimes of a handful of class enemies in sabotaging production and causing accidents, exposing traitors, spies, and other counter-revolutionary elements who had long been hiding in the mine, and implementing mass dictatorship. The revolutionary situation became better and better, and production also entered a better phase.

There was a coal mining team that had always struggled to meet production targets in the past, and the workers felt frustrated. The leadership team was also anxious. They studied production targets and formulated production measures, but production did not improve. With the help of the PLA, the revolutionary workers of this team analyzed and found that the root cause of the production problems lay with a long-hidden counter-revolutionary element. This person, during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, instigated military-civilian relations and relations between cadres and the masses, incited workers to stop work and cause trouble, created accidents in the mine, and sabotaged production, causing significant harm. After this person was exposed, the entire team's revolutionary workers became more enthusiastic about focusing on revolution and promoting production. Under the same working conditions, they completed the state's production plan by more than 100%.

Relying on Mao Zedong Thought to Build the Mine and Use Revolution to Drive Production

The result of focusing on class struggle was that the revolutionary masses' awareness of the two-line struggle was greatly heightened, and the revolutionary criticism movement burned more fiercely. The mine's revolutionary committee targeted the criticism of China's Khrushchev's revisionist enterprise management line of "business first" and "money as the commander," and combined it with the struggle, criticism, and transformation within the unit. They thoroughly criticized China's Khrushchev's line of promoting overproduction for awards and overproduction for praise, which was a personal quest for fame and awards.

In the past, a handful of capitalist roaders within Benxi Mining Bureau and Niu Xintai Coal Mine vigorously promoted China's Khrushchev's revisionist enterprise management line, shouting "coal mining is for making money" and promoting "piecework contracting," "business first," and "bonus as the commander" to corrupt workers. They pursued production targets without regard for workers' safety and hard work, attempting to lead workers into the revisionist quagmire of "everything for coal mining, coal mining for money." Everyone used numerous facts to denounce and criticize the harm of China's Khrushchev's revisionist enterprise management line to workers. The workers angrily said: "Their revisionist goods are the same as those of the Kuomintang and capitalists. In the past, the mine owners and foremen used this method to force and deceive us workers to work for them. Workers armed with Mao Zedong Thought are the masters of the mine. We mine coal not for a few dollars, but for the socialist construction of our motherland and to support the world revolution."

Deepening the revolutionary criticism movement made Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line further grasped by the broad revolutionary workers. They realized that relying on politics to build the mine or relying on business to build the mine is the fundamental difference between the proletarian and bourgeois enterprise management lines. China's Khrushchev's revisionist enterprise management line is a line of restoring capitalism. We rely on Mao Zedong Thought to build the mine, use proletarian politics to build the mine, and use revolution to drive production, which is the only correct path. The broad revolutionary workers all said: "We produce more coal and better coal, not to compete for awards, but to show more loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao and to contribute more to the world revolution." For a period, the working conditions of the 362 coal mining team's working face were very poor, with the thinnest coal seam only a few centimeters thick, and the geological conditions were also poor, with serious water seepage. Under these extremely difficult conditions, the broad revolutionary workers, relying on the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, gave full play to the positive factors of people and still overfulfilled the state plan.

Revolution is the locomotive driving production. The revolution and production of Niu Xintai Coal Mine have leaped forward again and again. The daily coal production has continuously broken the highest record since the mine was built, with an attendance rate of over 90%. Workers labor without calculating rewards, work without calculating time, and the moving deeds of communist cooperation emerge in endless waves. The mine's raw coal production has completed the first half of the year's state production plan 33 days ahead of schedule, and tunneling has completed it 24 days ahead of schedule.

    以阶级斗争为纲建设矿山发展生产
    ——记牛心台煤矿在解放军帮助下抓革命促生产的斗争
    辽宁省本溪矿务局牛心台煤矿，在解放军毛泽东思想宣传队帮助下，贯彻执行毛主席关于“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，在狠抓阶级斗争中建设矿山，发展生产，使革命和生产出现了新的跃进。
    继续狠抓阶级斗争  巩固和发展胜利
    牛心台煤矿去年在全市第一个成立了革命委员会，提前二十一天完成了全年煤炭生产任务，今年又提前八天完成第一季度的生产任务，受到各级领导机关的多次表扬。在这种大好形势下，一部分干部和群众认为：“咱们是窗户眼吹喇叭——名声在外。要想保住我们的声誉，必须把生产搞上去。”在这种思想影响下，矿里一度出现埋头抓生产、忽视对敌斗争的现象。
    矿革命委员会和解放军宣传队的同志，针对这个思想问题，举办了毛泽东思想学习班，组织有关干部学习毛主席论政治工作和一系列最新指示。毛主席亲自主持制定的“十六条”中指出：“无产阶级文化大革命是使我国社会生产力发展的一个强大的推动力。把文化大革命同发展生产对立起来，这种看法是不对的。”通过反复学习讨论，大家深刻地认识到：埋头抓生产，不首先抓革命，是极端错误的，发展下去，会使人看不到阶级斗争，久而久之就会滑到修正主义的邪路上去。大家还认识到，为了保住本矿原来的声誉，而去单纯地抓业务，是由于有些同志头脑里还存在着锦标主义思想，正好说明中国赫鲁晓夫的流毒在矿里还远远没有肃清。
    接着，革委会的同志们又总结了本矿前一时期抓革命、促生产的经验。他们进一步认识到，只有紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，继续狠狠抓住阶级斗争这条纲，不断提高广大革命职工的阶级斗争和两条路线斗争的觉悟，才能不断巩固和发展胜利，把生产提高到新水平，建设好社会主义的新矿山。他们从两条路线斗争的高度，分析了单纯业务观点和锦标主义思想，认为这实质上是走业务建矿的修正主义道路的反映；新生的革命委员会绝不能走这条老路，而要带领革命群众走政治建矿的道路。革委会的同志们在提高认识的基础上，狠批了中国赫鲁晓夫的“业务第一”和党内另一个最大的走资派“不管黑猫白猫，捉住老鼠就是好猫”的反动谬论，肃清他们散布的修正主义毒害。
    把学习班办到阶级斗争第一线上去
    革委会和宣传队又把学习班搬到阶级斗争和生产斗争的第一线上去。他们来到粘土坑，和广大革命群众一起学习了毛主席关于“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的教导，一起分析研究阶级斗争的新问题、新动向、新特点。前些日子，当全矿广大革命职工努力夺高产的时候，有个反革命分子趁机破坏生产，干了许多坏事。这次，他们把这个坏家伙揪了出来，并从这个活生生的阶级斗争现实中，更加看清了埋头抓生产、不突出无产阶级政治的危险性，更加懂得了阶级斗争一时一刻也不能放松，否则就等于忘记了根本。
    革委会抓住粘土坑这个典型，进一步推动了全矿区的对敌斗争。广大革命职工对一小撮阶级敌人破坏生产、制造事故的种种罪行，展开了大揭发、大批判、大斗争，把长期隐藏在矿里的叛徒、特务和其它反革命分子，一个一个挖了出来，实行群众专政。革命形势越来越好，生产也出现了更好的局面。
    有一个采煤队，过去生产指标一直上不去，工人们感到憋气，领导班子也急得团团转。他们又是研究生产指标，又是制定生产措施，可是生产还是不见起色。在解放军帮助下，这个队的革命职工经过分析，看清了生产上不去的根子，是在一个长期隐藏的反革命分子身上。这个家伙在无产阶级文化大革命期间，挑拨军民关系和干群关系，拉拢工人停工闹事，在井下制造事故，破坏生产，影响很坏。当这个家伙被揪出来之后，全队革命职工抓革命、促生产的劲头越来越足，在同样的工作条件下，超额一倍完成了国家生产计划。
    靠毛泽东思想建矿  用革命带动生产
    狠抓阶级斗争的结果，革命群众的两条路线斗争的觉悟大大提高，革命大批判的烈火越烧越旺。矿革委会又有的放矢地把对中国赫鲁晓夫“业务第一”、“金钱挂帅”等修正主义办企业路线的批判，和本单位的斗批改结合起来，把中国赫鲁晓夫推行的超产为得奖、超产图表扬的个人锦标主义批得体无完肤。
    过去本溪矿务局和牛心台煤矿里的一小撮走资派，极力推行中国赫鲁晓夫的修正主义办企业路线，大叫“采煤就是为了赚钱”，大搞“计件包工”、“业务第一”、“奖金挂帅”，来腐蚀工人。他们一味地追求生产指标，不管工人的安全和劳累，企图把工人们引进“一切为了采煤，采煤为了挣钱”的修正主义泥坑。大家用大量事实，控诉和批判了中国赫鲁晓夫修正主义办企业路线对工人的毒害。工人们愤怒地说：“他们搞的这一套修正主义货色，和国民党、资本家那一套完全一样，过去矿山主、把头就是用这一套强迫、诱骗我们工人为他们卖命。用毛泽东思想武装起来的工人阶级是矿山的主人，我们采煤决不是为了几个钱，而是为了祖国的社会主义建设，为了支援世界革命。”
    深入开展革命大批判，使毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，进一步为广大革命职工所掌握。他们认识到：是靠政治建矿，还是靠业务建矿，是无产阶级和资产阶级两条办企业路线的根本区别。中国赫鲁晓夫的修正主义办企业路线，就是一条复辟资本主义的路线。我们靠毛泽东思想建矿，用无产阶级政治建矿，用革命带动生产，才是唯一正确的道路。广大革命职工都说：“我们多出煤，出好煤，决不是为了争锦标，而是为了对伟大领袖毛主席多尽一份忠心，为世界革命多贡献一份力量。”有一个时期，三六二采煤队的掌子面生产条件很坏，最薄的煤层只有十几厘米，地质情况又不好，还出现了严重的淋头水。在这种极其困难的情况下，广大革命工人凭着战无不胜的毛泽东思想，发挥人的积极因素，照样超额完成了国家计划。
    革命是带动生产的火车头。牛心台煤矿的革命和生产出现了一个又一个新的跃进。煤炭生产的日产量，接连刷新建矿以来的最高纪录，出勤率达到百分之九十以上，工人们劳动不计报酬，工作不计时间，共产主义大协作的动人事迹层出不穷。全矿原煤生产已提前三十三天，掘进提前二十四天完成了上半年的国家生产计划。
