The soldiers stationed at the "131 Construction Site" faced severe water shortages. The local railway workers, filled with deep class sentiments, went to great lengths to deliver box after box of water to their comrades in the People's Liberation Army.

On a Sunday morning, a railway motorcycle, towing a water tank, sped along the Mudanjiang line towards the old Songling in the Changbai Mountains. The words "Support the Army, Love the People" were prominently displayed in large red characters on the tank, shining brightly in the sun. Driver Shen Linshan and his assistant Liu Xiangyi were particularly happy today. As they kept their eyes on the road ahead, they sang "The unity of soldiers and civilians is like one person; see who can stand against us," a song based on Chairman Mao's teachings, determined to complete the glorious task assigned by the revolutionary cadres and workers of the Tumen City Railway Bureau—to deliver this box of water, filled with class friendship, to their comrades in the People's Liberation Army who were guarding the "131 Construction Site" day and night.

The "131 Construction Site" was guarded by soldiers from the Eighth Company, First Platoon of a certain unit. The site is at a high altitude, and the weather is dry with little rainfall. The soldiers faced significant difficulties in obtaining and using water. They tried various methods to find water sources and dig wells nearby, but due to the low water table, their attempts to dig wells were unsuccessful. Therefore, the soldiers, carrying red revolutionary books, took turns to go down the mountain, about ten miles away, to fetch water.

The soldiers' efforts to fetch water from down the mountain quickly came to the attention of the revolutionary cadres of the Tumen City Railway Bureau. They recalled how the People's Liberation Army, during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, armed the masses with Mao Zedong Thought and fought side by side with the revolutionary masses. Now, the People's Liberation Army, to ensure the safety of railway transportation, was bravely and tenaciously fighting against nature. This revolutionary spirit deeply moved everyone and made them realize even more that the People's Liberation Army is the closest kin of the revolutionary cadres, a model to learn from. They decided to respond to Chairman Mao's great call to "Support the Army, Love the People" with concrete actions and quickly help their comrades solve the water shortage problem. That evening, the production command department of the bureau organized members of relevant units' revolutionary committees and veteran workers to hold a meeting to discuss solutions.

"Let's use the train going to Mudanjiang to carry the water." "No good! The soldiers' living area is on a steep section of the railway, stopping halfway to unload water could cause a derailment accident."

"Use a single-car locomotive to transport the water!" "That won't work either! It's slow, and it can't carry much water, which won't meet the needs of the comrades."

To deliver water to their comrades, the meeting proposed one plan after another, but all were rejected.

"Use a motorcycle to deliver the water!" Shen, a worker from the Electric Water Section, came up with another good idea.

"We have water tanks!" "We have flatbed trailers!" Shen's suggestion immediately received the support of the attendees. Everyone's furrowed brows relaxed.

"But we have few motorcycles, and production is tight right now!"

At this moment, Shen stood up suddenly, clenched his fist, and firmly said, "Chairman Mao teaches us: 'We must support the army and love the people.' Doing a good job of supporting the army and cherishing the people's children is defending Chairman Mao's revolutionary line with practical actions. The task is urgent, we will work overtime, and we must ensure the soldiers' water supply."

Li, a worker from the Construction Section sitting next to Shen, also firmly stated: "To ensure that the soldiers always have water, we will go to the '131 Construction Site' tomorrow to help the soldiers expand the water storage pool."

That night, the plan to deliver water to their comrades was finalized.

On Sunday morning, as the sun rose over the eastern hills, Shen and Liu drove the motorcycle, towing the first tank of water, and set off. After more than three hours, they arrived at the "131 Construction Site." The soldiers warmly welcomed them, holding up revolutionary books and portraits of Chairman Mao. As the clear water flowed from the tank into the pool, the soldiers could no longer contain their excitement and repeatedly raised their fists, shouting:

"Long live Chairman Mao! Long, long live Chairman Mao!"

"Wishing Chairman Mao eternal life!" ...

From then on, every few days, Shen and Liu would deliver clean water to the soldiers. This water bound the hearts of the soldiers and the railway workers even tighter.

    军民情深水更甜
    在“131工地”执行任务的解放军同志，吃水十分困难，当地的铁路工人们，怀着无限深厚的阶级感情，千方百计地把一箱箱水送给亲人解放军。
    星期天清晨，一辆拖着水箱的铁路摩托车沿着牡图线朝长白山里的老松岭飞快奔驰。车箱上“拥军爱民”几个大红字，在灿烂的阳光下显得格外耀眼夺目。司机沈林南和他的助手刘祥义今天特别高兴，他们一边注视前方，一边高唱着“军民团结如一人，试看天下谁能敌”的毛主席语录歌，决心完成图们市铁路分局广大革命职工交给的光荣任务——把这箱充满阶级友爱的水尽快送给日夜守卫在
  “131工地”的亲人——解放军。
    “131工地”上驻守着某部八连一排的同志们。这里地势高，加上天气又旱，雨水稀少，解放军同志们吃水、用水遇到很大的困难。他们曾想方设法在附近找水源，打水井，由于水位太低，几次打井都没有成功。于是，战士们就怀揣红彤彤的革命宝书，轮流到山下十几里外的地方去背水。
    解放军下山背水的事，很快就被图们市铁路分局的无产阶级革命派知道了。他们回想起解放军在无产阶级文化大革命运动中用毛泽东思想武装群众，和广大革命群众团结一致，并肩战斗的情景，现在解放军为了保卫铁路运输的安全，又英勇顽强地和大自然搏斗。这种革命精神，使大家深受感动，也更加体会到：解放军是无产阶级革命派最亲最亲的亲人，是自己学习的好榜样。他们决心以实际行动响应毛主席“拥军爱民”的伟大号召，尽快帮助亲人解决缺水的问题。当天晚上，分局生产指挥部就组织有关单位革委会成员和老工人一起开会，研究解决的办法。
      “利用去牡丹江的火车带水去吧。”“不行！战士们住的地方正是铁路坡度比较大的地方，半道停车卸水容易出现滑车事故。”
    “用单轮机车送！”“也不行！速度慢，装水少，满足不了同志们的需要。”
    为了给亲人送水，会上提出了一个又一个方案，又都被否决了。
      “用摩托车送！”电水段沈师傅又想出了一个好办法。
    “我们有水箱！”“我们有平板车！”沈师傅的建议立刻得到了到会同志的支持。人们紧皱的眉头舒展开了。
      “可是，我们当前摩托车少，生产正紧哪！”
    这时，沈师傅“呼”地一下子站起来，紧攥拳头坚定地说：“毛主席教导我们：‘要拥军爱民’。做好拥军工作，爱护人民子弟兵，就是用实际行动捍卫了毛主席的革命路线。任务紧，我们加班干，无论如何也要保证解放军的吃水、用水。”
    坐在沈师傅身旁的建筑段李师傅也坚定地表示：为了使解放军的同志经常有积蓄用水，明天就去“131工地”帮助解放军扩建蓄水池。
    深夜，给亲人送水的方案就这样定了下来。
    星期天的早晨，一轮红日刚跃出东边的小山头，沈师傅和小刘便驾驶着摩托车，拖着第一箱水出发了。三个多小时后，他们来到了“131工地”。解放军的战士们高擎革命宝书和毛主席画像热烈欢迎他们。当一股股清水从水箱流进水池的时候，战士们再也抑制不住内心的激动，一遍又一遍地振臂高呼：
    “毛主席万岁！毛主席万万岁！”
    “敬祝毛主席万寿无疆！”……
    从此，每隔几天，沈师傅和小刘便给战士们送一次清水。这水，把解放军和铁路工人的心连得更紧了。　　图兵文
