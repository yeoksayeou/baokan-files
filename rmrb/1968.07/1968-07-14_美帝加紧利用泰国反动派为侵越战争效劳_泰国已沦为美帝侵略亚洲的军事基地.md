The U.S. imperialists, finding themselves in a desperate situation in the Vietnam War, are intensifying their use of Thai reactionaries to serve their war efforts. On one hand, they are constantly recruiting cannon fodder from Thailand for the war in Vietnam; on the other hand, they are accelerating the process of turning Thailand into a U.S. military base for aggression.

According to reports, under the direction of the U.S. imperialists, the Thanom-Kittikachorn traitorous clique is preparing to send another 5,500 mercenaries to South Vietnam in July to serve as cannon fodder; the U.S. Air Force has already begun transporting this batch of Thai cannon fodder from Bangkok, with 275 people transported on July 1st. The U.S. State Department revealed that the Thanom-Kittikachorn traitorous clique will provide 11,000 cannon fodder for the U.S. war in Vietnam in the second half of this year.

Previously, Thailand had already dispatched approximately 2,500 army personnel, a small air force unit, and a naval force including two warships to South Vietnam to fight for the U.S. war in Vietnam.

The Thanom-Kittikachorn traitorous clique, which is willing to act as a running dog for the U.S. imperialists, in order to beg the U.S. to support its fascist dictatorship, is shamelessly selling out Thailand's sovereignty and national interests. It not only provides cannon fodder for the U.S. but has also turned Thailand into a military base for U.S. imperialist aggression against Vietnam and other Asian countries. The U.S. imperialists have long admitted that the large-scale air bases newly built and expanded in Thailand in recent years, such as U-Tapao, Udon Thani, Ubon, Takhli, and Korat, are actually important military bases for bombing Vietnam and Laos. About 80% of the U.S. bandit planes that bomb North Vietnam take off from U.S. air bases in Thailand. The B-52 bombers currently used by the U.S. imperialists in the Vietnam War are mostly stationed at U.S. air bases in Thailand and take off from there. Recently, the U.S. has also sent its so-called latest F-111-A bombers to Thailand to participate in this act of aggression.

The U.S. imperialists have completed a vast network of military bases throughout Thailand and are constantly expanding it. According to incomplete statistics, the U.S. imperialists have established about 60 major military facilities in Thailand, including more than 30 large air bases and reserve airports, 11 army camps, 4 missile launch sites, 2 radar stations, and 10 naval bases and supply depots. The naval base in Sattahip has been developed into Thailand's second deep-water port. The U.S. invasion forces' logistics base in Korat is stockpiled with enough weapons and ammunition to equip more than 100,000 U.S. troops. In addition, the U.S. imperialists have also built many strategic roads in Thailand. Starting from Bangkok and Sattahip, these roads connect U.S. military bases and lead to the northeastern border with Cambodia and Laos, as well as the southern border with China near Chiang Rai.

The U.S. imperialists' aggression against Thailand and their criminal acts of turning Thailand into a military base for aggression against Vietnam and other Asian countries have aroused increasingly fierce resistance from the Thai people. Under the leadership of the Communist Party of Thailand, the Thai people are waging armed struggles to drive out the U.S. imperialists and overthrow the reactionary rule of the Thanom-Kittikachorn traitorous clique. The heinous crimes of the U.S. imperialists and the Thanom-Kittikachorn traitorous clique will surely be punished by the people.

### 美帝加紧利用泰国反动派为侵越战争效劳  泰国已沦为美帝侵略亚洲的军事基地

    美帝加紧利用泰国反动派为侵越战争效劳
    泰国已沦为美帝侵略亚洲的军事基地
    新华社讯　在侵越战争中走投无路的美帝国主义，正在加紧利用泰国反动派为它的侵越战争效劳。它一方面不断在泰国搜罗侵越炮灰，一方面加速使泰国沦为美帝的侵略基地。
    据报道，在美帝国主义的指使下，他侬—巴博卖国集团准备在七月间再运送五千五百名帮凶军到南越去充当炮灰；美帝的空军已经开始从曼谷运载这批泰国炮灰，七月一日运载的一批就有二百七十五人。美国国务院透露，他侬—巴博卖国集团在今年下半年还将为美帝侵越战争提供一万一千名炮灰。
    在这以前，泰国已经派有约二千五百名陆军、一小队空军和一支包括有两艘舰艇的海军在南越为美帝侵越战争卖命。
    甘心充当美帝走狗的他侬—巴博卖国集团，为了乞求美帝来支撑它的法西斯独裁统治，大肆拍卖泰国的主权和民族利益，它不仅为美帝提供炮灰，并且已经把泰国变为美帝国主义侵略越南和侵略其他亚洲国家的军事基地。美帝国主义早就承认：近几年在泰国新建和扩建的乌塔保、乌隆、乌汶、打卡里、呵叻等大型空军基地，实际上是美帝轰炸越南和老挝的重要军事基地。轰炸越南北方的美国强盗飞机有百分之八十左右是从美国在泰国的空军基地起飞的。美帝国主义目前在侵越战争中使用的B—52型轰炸机，绝大部分驻扎在美国在泰国的空军基地，并且是从那里起飞的。不久前，美国还把它大肆吹嘘的所谓最新式的F—111—A型轰炸机派往泰国参加这一侵略罪行。
    美帝国主义在泰国全国各地已经完成了一个庞大的军事基地网，并且不断地加以扩充。据不完全的统计，美帝国主义在泰国建立的重大军事设施约莫达六十处之多，其中有大型空军基地和后备机场三十多个，陆军兵营十一个，火箭发射场四个，雷达站两处，海军基地和兵站十处。设在梭桃邑的海军基地，已经开辟成泰国的第二个深水港口。设在呵叻的美国侵略军后勤基地，储备了足以装备十多万美军的武器和弹药。此外，美帝国主义还在泰国修建了许多战略公路。以曼谷和梭桃邑为起点，这些公路都连接美国军事基地，通往东北部柬埔寨和老挝的边境以及邻近中国南部的清莱府。
    美帝国主义对泰国的侵略和美帝国主义把泰国变成它侵略越南和亚洲其他国家的军事基地的罪恶行径，激起了泰国人民越来越激烈的反抗。泰国人民正在泰国共产党的领导下，展开武装斗争，为驱逐美帝国主义和推翻他侬—巴博卖国集团的反动统治而英勇战斗。美帝国主义和他侬—巴博卖国集团的滔天罪行，必将受到人民的制裁。
