Mao Zedong Thought guides us that life is contradiction, life is struggle, and the world advances through the struggle of contradictions. The development of the Party is the same. As our great leader Chairman Mao has taught us: “If there are no contradictions and struggles to resolve them within the Party, the life of the Party will cease.”

Since the founding of our Party, there has never been a halt in intra-party struggles. Party struggles are a reflection of class struggles in society, and they are concentrated in the struggle between the two lines within the Party. One line is: insisting that the Chinese revolution must be led by the proletariat, transitioning through the stage of the new democratic revolution to the socialist revolution, and carrying out the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat to the end, with the ultimate goal of achieving communism. This is the proletarian revolutionary line represented by our great leader Chairman Mao. The other line is: abolishing the proletarian leadership of the Chinese revolution, opposing the new democratic revolution and the socialist revolution, opposing the dictatorship of the proletariat, and taking the capitalist road, which means returning China to the dark old path of semi-colonial and semi-feudal society. This is the reactionary bourgeois line consistently pursued by Chen Duxiu, Qu Qiubai, Li Lisan, Wang Ming, Zhang Guotao, and up to the Chinese Khrushchev. The Chinese Khrushchev is the most concentrated representative of this reactionary line. The history of our Party is a history of the struggle between the proletarian revolutionary line of Chairman Mao and the reactionary bourgeois line.

As early as 1938, Chairman Mao summarized the two-line struggle against “left” and “right” opportunism within the Party over the past seventeen years, pointing out: “Our Party has grown stronger and more robust through the struggle on two fronts.” Chairman Mao pointed out that due to the victory over the struggle against “left” and “right” opportunism, the Party made great progress.

However, the Chinese Khrushchev, driven by his counter-revolutionary bourgeois nature, is terrified and hates the intra-party struggles under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought. In 1941, he published the poisonous weed “On Party Struggles,” openly opposing Chairman Mao. The Chinese Khrushchev gritted his teeth and said: “With great sacrifices, great costs, and much suffering, we have achieved insufficient and insufficient progress and achievements of the Party. This is the basic summary of our past intra-party struggles.” What “basic summary”? This is a blatant slander that the Party’s struggle against “left” and “right” opportunism is “terrible.”

Our great leader Chairman Mao, with his profound wisdom, led the entire Party in a long, arduous, and unyielding struggle, repeatedly defeating various opportunists, and continuously strengthening and expanding our Party. The Zunyi Conference in 1935 established Chairman Mao’s leadership in the Central Committee and the entire Party. The Party and the people found their greatest leader, found the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, and Chairman Mao’s proletarian revolutionary line. This is the most brilliant victory in our intra-party struggles, our greatest happiness and pride. Chairman Mao scientifically summarized the experiences of the two-line struggle within our Party, criticized the erroneous methods of the “left” opportunist line in intra-party struggles, and formulated the only correct, systematic theory, policy, principles, methods, and guidelines for intra-party struggles for our Party, creatively developing Marxism-Leninism.

The old counter-revolutionary and great traitor, the Chinese Khrushchev, has consistently opposed Chairman Mao’s great theory on intra-party struggles for over forty years, ferociously attacking the intra-party struggles under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought. He plays dirty counter-revolutionary tricks, on the one hand, vigorously promoting “unification of the two” and peddling the “party peace” theory, attempting to alter Chairman Mao’s great policy of actively carrying out intra-party struggles, using it to shield and indulge a small handful of traitors, spies, and counter-revolutionary revisionists who have infiltrated the Party. On the other hand, he vigorously promotes the reactionary bourgeois line of “ruthless struggle, merciless blows,” ferociously opposing and sabotaging Chairman Mao’s revolutionary line, striking and suppressing the vast number of Party members and cadres who are absolutely loyal to our great leader Chairman Mao. The Chinese Khrushchev attempts to use these two counter-revolutionary tactics to alter the great, glorious, and correct Chinese Communist Party, led by Chairman Mao, into a revisionist party, a fascist party, and a tool for his conspiracy to restore capitalism in our country. This completely exposes the hideous face of the Chinese Khrushchev, the agent of the Kuomintang.

Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: “The correct political and military lines are not naturally and peacefully produced and developed, but are produced and developed through struggle.” He also says: “It is either the east wind prevailing over the west wind, or the west wind prevailing over the east wind. There is no room for compromise on the issue of lines.” We must take the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as our weapon, firmly grasp the key of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines, and actively carry out intra-party struggles to defeat the reactionary bourgeois line, so that our Party can advance victoriously along Chairman Mao’s revolutionary line!

As early as the 1940s, Chairman Mao led the entire Party in carrying out the great rectification movement, thoroughly settling accounts with the “left” and “right” opportunist lines pursued by Chen Duxiu, Qu Qiubai, Li Lisan, Wang Ming, and Zhang Guotao. The Yan’an Rectification Movement was a struggle between Marxism-Leninism and anti-Marxism-Leninism, a struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, and it holds great historical significance in the history of Marxist party building. Without the Yan’an Rectification Movement, there would be no unity and solidarity of the entire Party on the basis of Mao Zedong Thought; without the Yan’an Rectification Movement, there would be no victory in the War of Resistance Against Japan and the War of Liberation.

The Chinese Khrushchev extremely hates the great Yan’an Rectification Movement. In the poisonous weed “On Party Struggles” he concocted in 1941 and later revised and published, he did not mention the struggle between the two lines within the Party but fiercely attacked our struggle against the “left” and “right” opportunist lines as “deliberately seeking ‘objects of struggle’ ‘as representatives of opportunism’ to carry out struggles.” He audaciously distorted the history of the Party, claiming that “there is no systematic organizational theory of right opportunism openly proposed within our Party.” According to him, Chen Duxiu, Zhang Guotao, Wang Ming, and even himself, the Chinese Khrushchev, the right opportunist and right capitulationist and right splitist lines they pursued, are not systematic right opportunism! Isn’t this a blatant attempt to rehabilitate this small handful of old right opportunists, old counter-revolutionary revisionists?

The Chinese Khrushchev desperately conceals the class nature of intra-party struggles, attempting to obliterate the struggle between the two lines within the Party. In the poisonous weed “On the Cultivation of Party Members in Organization and Discipline” he published at the same time, he absurdly compared intra-party contradictions to the contradictions of “one bull and one cow,” “one man and one woman.” He said the Party “is a combination of contradictions, with leaders and followers, with Party leaders and Party members, with higher-level organizations and lower-level organizations,” but he did not mention class contradictions or the struggle between the two lines within the Party. Without the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, without the struggle between the two lines within the Party, abstractly discussing the contradictions between leaders and followers, leaders and Party members, higher-level organizations and lower-level organizations, is a thoroughly anti-Marxist fallacy. It is from this fallacy that he proposes the counter-revolutionary theory of “subordinates must absolutely obey superiors,” “even if superiors are wrong, they must still be obeyed.”

The Chinese Khrushchev vigorously obliterates the class nature of intra-party struggles, claiming that intra-party struggles are all about “ideological understanding” and “methods of handling problems.” He absurdly says that the essence and content of intra-party struggles are basically ideological struggles. He also says: “Because different Party members have different methods of looking at problems, their methods of handling problems are also different… leading to intra-party struggles.” From this fallacy, he even claims that traitors surrendering to the enemy and betraying the Party is “a moment of weakness.” In the eyes of the Chinese Khrushchev, betraying the Party is just “different methods of looking at problems” and “different methods of handling problems.” This is the most shameless defense of traitors.

The Chinese Khrushchev spreads these fallacies, concentrating on one point, which is to attempt to alter Chairman Mao’s policy of actively carrying out intra-party struggles. Marxist dialectics hold that struggle is absolute, and unity is relative; only by continuously carrying out intra-party struggles can the unity and solidarity of the Party be consolidated, and the Party can be more proletarianized. However, the Chinese Khrushchev proposes an anti-Marxist “party peace” theory that does not advocate struggle but only unity. During the Yan’an Rectification period, he vigorously promoted the idea of “unity, harmony, and solidarity within our Party,” and vigorously advocated “the national character of the Chinese people likes to be magnanimous,” “to have the heart of an elder,” and “to be good to others.” He slandered our correct struggle against the opportunist line as “excessive struggle.” If we follow the “policy” of the Chinese Khrushchev, we can only “advocate unity and harmony” towards the opportunist line and cannot carry out struggles. The Chinese Khrushchev does this to fundamentally deny the struggle between the two lines within the Party and deny the great rectification movement.

In 1957, when our Party was once again carrying out a rectification movement throughout the Party and rightists took the opportunity to fiercely attack the Party, the Chinese Khrushchev jumped out again. In society, he spread the theory of “extinction of class struggle” everywhere, advocating “emphasizing the oneness of the bourgeoisie, not emphasizing the struggle,” vigorously obstructing our counterattack against the rightists. Within the Party, he attempted to alter the rectification policy. He told his disciple, the great traitor Yang Xianzhen: “This policy is to emphasize oneness. The handling policy can focus on its oneness. Because there is originally oneness, we subjectively do not need to emphasize struggle first…. We can adopt conciliatory methods to resolve it.” The counter-revolutionary policy of the Chinese Khrushchev is to allow the bourgeois rightists to fiercely attack the Party but not allow the Party to lead the people in counterattacking. Later, the counter-revolutionary revisionist Yang Xianzhen, under the instructions of the Chinese Khrushchev, carefully concocted the reactionary fallacy of “unification of the two,” viciously attacking Chairman Mao’s dialectical method of dividing into two.

In 1962, the Chinese Khrushchev, in his revised and published black “Cultivation,” once again vigorously peddled the “party peace” theory, viciously attacking our intra-party struggles as “mechanical, subjective, and tyrannical.” He even slandered the Central Committee’s Lushan Conference struggle against the rightist anti-Party clique of Peng Dehuai as “repeating the historical errors of ruthless struggle and merciless blows,” shamelessly shouting that “the Central Committee should be held responsible,” openly advocating for the rightist opportunists and spreading a rightist rehabilitation wind.

The Chinese Khrushchev spreads the “party peace” theory, attempting to bind the hands and feet of the vast number of Party members, not allowing us to struggle against various non-proletarian ideologies, not allowing us to struggle against the reactionary bourgeois line, not allowing us to struggle against the traitors, spies, and counter-revolutionaries who have infiltrated the Party. This allows this small handful of class enemies to hide for a long time, engage in sabotage activities in dark corners, and openly promote the counter-revolutionary revisionist line. Facts have proven that they are struggling against us every moment. They wave the red flag to oppose the red flag, continuously opposing Chairman Mao’s proletarian headquarters, opposing and sabotaging Chairman Mao’s proletarian revolutionary line, fiercely carrying out the conspiracy to seize the Party, the army, and the government, and restoring capitalism. History has proven that the so-called “party peace” theory is an extremely treacherous and vicious counter-revolutionary seizure of the Party fallacy!

In intra-party struggles, our great leader Chairman Mao has always taught us to strictly distinguish between two types of contradictions of different natures and to adhere to the principle of being ruthless to the enemy and lenient to ourselves. For those class enemies who have infiltrated the Party and those stubborn elements who insist on erroneous lines and refuse to change, we must resolutely struggle against them to the end until they are expelled from the Party. For comrades who have made mistakes, as long as they are not stubborn and unrepentant, we should adopt the policy of “unity—criticism and self-criticism—unity,” “punishing past mistakes to prevent future ones, curing the sickness to save the patient.” It is precisely because our Party adheres to this correct principle of intra-party struggles that it has repeatedly defeated the reactionary bourgeois line and, on the basis of Chairman Mao’s proletarian revolutionary line, continuously strengthened the unity and solidarity of the entire Party in ideology, politics, and organization.

For a long time, the Chinese Khrushchev has consistently confused right and wrong and blurred the two types of contradictions of different natures in intra-party struggles. While peddling the “party peace” theory and shouting against “excessive struggles” to protect a small handful of class enemies who have infiltrated the Party, he adopts a reactionary policy of ruthless struggle and merciless blows against the vast number of Party members and revolutionary comrades who are loyal to Chairman Mao.

In 1947, during the land reform movement, the Chinese Khrushchev, together with the great traitor Peng Zhen and others, carried out the notorious “moving stones” reactionary policy. They listed the vast number of grassroots cadres in rural areas as “stones” and proposed the reactionary slogan of “kicking out grassroots cadres” and “struggling against cadres is struggling against landlords,” shouting loudly that “we should not be afraid of Party members and cadres leaving the Party, even in large numbers,” “those who leave will leave, those who are struck will be struck.” Such a heavy blow against the vast number of grassroots cadres and Party members in rural areas is a strike against the proletariat and the poor and lower-middle peasants, protecting landlords and the bourgeoisie.

In 1964, during the great socialist education movement, the Chinese Khrushchev again proposed a reactionary bourgeois line that was “left” in form but right in essence. To protect a small handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, he altered the struggle between the two classes and the two roads into a struggle between “the clean and the unclean,” proposing “solving whatever problems there are,” creating excuses, diverting the main direction of the struggle, and striking the vast number of grassroots cadres and community members, suppressing revolutionary masses. He instructed his wife, the bourgeois element Wang XX, to carry out the so-called “Taoyuan Experience,” which was a typical example of protecting a few and striking many. Of course, the Chinese Khrushchev’s conspiracy did not succeed. The “Twenty-three Articles” personally drafted by Chairman Mao smashed the reactionary bourgeois line of the Chinese Khrushchev, achieving a great victory in the socialist education movement.

Up to the early period of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the Chinese Khrushchev saw that his own doomsday was approaching and hurriedly and intensified his reactionary bourgeois line once again. As Chairman Mao pointed out with precision, he “stood on the reactionary bourgeois position, implemented bourgeois dictatorship, suppressed the magnificent Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, reversed right and wrong, confused black and white, besieged the revolutionary factions, suppressed dissenting opinions, implemented white terror, and thought he was successful, boosting the prestige of the bourgeoisie and suppressing the spirit of the proletariat, how vicious it is!”

In summary, the old counter-revolutionary, the Chinese Khrushchev, has consistently used the methods of ruthless struggle and merciless blows to deal with our Party, with the vast number of Party members and cadres who are loyal to Chairman Mao, and to resist Chairman Mao’s proletarian revolutionary line. Chairman Mao recently pointed out: “Whether to protect or suppress the broad masses of the people is the fundamental difference between the Communist Party and the Kuomintang, the fundamental difference between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, and the fundamental difference between the dictatorship of the proletariat and the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie.” This exposes the counter-revolutionary nature of the reactionary bourgeois line of the Chinese Khrushchev. We must follow the great teachings of Chairman Mao, thoroughly smash the reactionary policy of the Chinese Khrushchev of striking many and protecting a few, thoroughly eliminate its poison, and resolutely protect the vast number of Party members and revolutionary comrades. For those comrades who have made this or that mistake, we must “start from the desire for unity, resolve contradictions through criticism or struggle, and achieve new unity on a new basis.” Those who should be struck are the small number of class enemies who have infiltrated the Party.

Our great teacher Chairman Mao recently pointed out profoundly: “The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is, in essence, a great political revolution of the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes under socialist conditions, a continuation of the long-term struggle between the Chinese Communist Party and its led revolutionary masses and the Kuomintang reactionaries, and a continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie.”

This great political revolution is also a great intra-party struggle. Under the personal initiation and leadership of our great leader Chairman Mao, our Party organized hundreds of millions of revolutionary masses to thoroughly settle accounts with the counter-revolutionary revisionist line represented by the Chinese Khrushchev over the past few decades, thoroughly smashed the bourgeois headquarters hidden within the organs of the dictatorship of the proletariat, led by the Chinese Khrushchev, and exposed a small handful of traitors, spies, and counter-revolutionary revisionists who had infiltrated our Party. They are the agents of the Kuomintang reactionaries and the bourgeoisie within our Party. In this great movement, many cadres who made mistakes were saved, and the vast number of Party members received the deepest education and tempering. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution tempered and cultivated a large number of proletarian advanced elements who are absolutely loyal to Chairman Mao, absolutely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and absolutely loyal to Chairman Mao’s proletarian revolutionary line, and produced a large number of new backbone forces. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is the greatest classroom of intra-party struggles for our Party, tempering our Party into a strong fortress of proletarian revolution.

The history of our Party reveals a great truth: intra-party struggles under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought are forever the life of the Party. Chairman Mao teaches us: “The Party organization should be composed of advanced elements of the proletariat, and should be a vigorous vanguard organization capable of leading the proletariat and revolutionary masses to fight against class enemies.” We must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, closely follow Chairman Mao’s great strategic deployment, fully implement Chairman Mao’s series of latest instructions, resolutely protect the broad revolutionary masses, and accurately and ruthlessly strike a small handful of traitors, spies, unrepentant capitalist roaders, and all counter-revolutionaries, carrying out the struggle between the two lines within the Party to the end, and seizing the overall victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

    毛泽东思想指导下的党内斗争是党的生命
    ——批判中国赫鲁晓夫在党内斗争中的反革命两面手法
    人民解放军总后勤部　红勤兵
    一
    马克思主义认为：生活就是矛盾，生活就是斗争，世界总是通过矛盾的斗争向前发展的。党的发展也是这样。正如我们伟大领袖毛主席教导的：“党内如果没有矛盾和解决矛盾的思想斗争，党的生命也就停止了。”
    我们党成立以来的四十多年中，党内斗争从来没有停止过。党内斗争是社会阶级斗争的反映，它集中表现为党内两条路线的斗争。一条路线是：坚持中国革命必须由无产阶级来领导，经过新民主主义革命阶段转变到社会主义革命阶段，把无产阶级专政下的革命进行到底，以实现共产主义为最终目的。这是我们伟大领袖毛主席所代表的无产阶级革命路线。另一条路线则是：取消中国革命的无产阶级领导权，反对新民主主义革命和社会主义革命，反对无产阶级专政，要走资本主义道路，也就是使中国回到半殖民地半封建社会的黑暗老路上去。这就是陈独秀、瞿秋白、李立三、王明、张国焘一直到中国赫鲁晓夫，一脉相承地推行的资产阶级反动路线。中国赫鲁晓夫则是这条反动路线最集中的代表。我们党的历史，就是毛主席的无产阶级革命路线不断战胜资产阶级反动路线的斗争史。
    早在一九三八年，毛主席就为过去十七年来党内反对“左”右倾机会主义的两条路线斗争作了总结，指出：“我们的党已经从两条战线斗争中巩固和壮大起来了。”毛主席指出，由于反对“左”右倾机会主义斗争的胜利，使党获得了伟大的进步。
    可是，中国赫鲁晓夫出于他的资产阶级反革命本性，对毛泽东思想指导下的党内斗争怕得要死，恨得要命。一九四一年，他抛出了大毒草《论党内斗争》，公开同毛主席唱反派。中国赫鲁晓夫咬牙切齿地说：“以很大的牺牲，很大的代价和很多痛苦，换来了不够大和不够多的党的进步和成绩。这就是我们过去党内斗争的基本总结”。什么“基本总结”？这是明目张胆地污蔑我们党反对“左”右倾机会主义的斗争是“糟得很”。
    我们伟大领袖毛主席，英明地领导全党进行了长期艰苦卓绝的斗争，一次又一次地战胜了形形色色的机会主义，不断地巩固和壮大了我们的党。一九三五年的遵义会议，确立了毛主席在中央和全党的领导，党和人民找到自己最伟大的领袖，找到了战无不胜的毛泽东思想和毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。这是我们党内斗争最光辉的胜利，是我们最大的幸福和骄傲。毛主席科学地总结了我们党内两条路线斗争的经验，批判了“左”倾机会主义路线在党内斗争中采用的错误方法，为我们党制定了唯一正确的系统的党内斗争的理论、方针、原则、方法和政策，创造性地发展了马克思列宁主义。
    中国赫鲁晓夫这个老反革命、大叛徒，四十多年来，一贯反对毛主席关于党内斗争的伟大理论，猖狂地攻击毛泽东思想指导下的党内斗争。他玩弄卑鄙的反革命两面手法，一方面，竭力鼓吹“合二而一”，兜售“党内和平”论，妄图篡改毛主席关于积极地开展党内斗争的伟大方针，借以包庇和纵容混进党内的一小撮叛徒、特务和反革命修正主义分子。另一方面，他大肆推行“残酷斗争、无情打击”的资产阶级反动路线，疯狂反对和破坏毛主席的革命路线，打击和镇压无限忠于伟大领袖毛主席的广大党员和干部。中国赫鲁晓夫就是妄图用这种反革命两手，把以毛主席为伟大领袖的伟大、光荣、正确的中国共产党，篡改为修正主义党、法西斯党，成为他阴谋在我国复辟资本主义的工具。这就彻底暴露了中国赫鲁晓夫这个国民党代理人的狰狞面目。
    二
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“正确的政治的和军事的路线，不是自然地平安地产生和发展起来的，而是从斗争中产生和发展起来的。”又说：“不是东风压倒西风，就是西风压倒东风，在路线问题上没有调和的余地。”我们只有以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，紧紧掌握阶级斗争、两条路线斗争这个纲，积极地开展党内斗争，才能战胜资产阶级反动路线，使我们党沿着毛主席的革命路线胜利前进！
    早在四十年代初期，毛主席领导全党，开展了伟大的整风运动，彻底清算了陈独秀、瞿秋白、李立三、王明、张国焘等推行的“左”右倾机会主义路线。延安整风运动，就是马克思列宁主义和反马克思列宁主义的斗争，就是无产阶级和资产阶级的斗争，在马克思主义建党史上具有伟大的历史意义。没有延安整风运动，就没有我们全党在毛泽东思想基础上的团结和统一；没有延安整风运动，就没有抗日战争和解放战争的胜利。
    中国赫鲁晓夫极端仇视伟大的延安整风运动。在他一九四一年炮制出笼、以后又修改抛出的《论党内斗争》这株大毒草中，他闭口不提党内两条路线的斗争，却大肆攻击我们对“左”右倾机会主义路线的斗争是“故意去寻找‘斗争对象’‘作为机会主义的代表者’来开展斗争”。他狗胆包天地公开歪曲党的历史，胡说什么“在我们党内公开提出系统的组织上的右倾机会主义的理论，是还没有的”。照他说来，陈独秀、张国焘、王明，还有他——中国赫鲁晓夫自己，他们所推行的那套右倾投降主义和右倾分裂主义，都不算是系统的右倾机会主义了！这难道不是明目张胆地为他们这一小撮老右倾机会主义分子、老反革命修正主义分子翻案吗？
    中国赫鲁晓夫拚命掩饰党内斗争的阶级实质，妄图抹煞党内两条路线的斗争。他在同时发表的《论党员在组织上和纪律上的修养》这株大毒草中，竟把党内矛盾比喻为“一条公牛加一条母牛”，“一个男人加一个女人”的矛盾；他说党“是一个矛盾的结合，有领导者和被领导者，有党的领袖和党员，有党的上级组织和下级组织”，他就是闭口不谈阶级矛盾，闭口不谈党内两条路线的斗争。离开了无产阶级和资产阶级的阶级斗争，离开了党内两条路线的斗争，抽象地谈论什么领导者和被领导者、领袖和党员、上级组织和下级组织之间的矛盾，就是彻头彻尾反马克思主义的谬论。他就是从这种谬论出发，提出“下级要绝对服从上级”，“即使上级错了，也还要服从”的反革命的“驯服工具”论。
    中国赫鲁晓夫极力抹杀党内斗争的阶级实质，把党内斗争统统说成是“思想认识”和“方法问题”。他胡说党内斗争“它的实质，它的内容，基本上还是一种思想斗争”。又说：“因为各种党员看问题的方法不同，就使他们处理问题的方法也有不同……就引起党内的斗争”。从这种谬论出发，他甚至把叛徒向敌人屈膝投降、自首叛党，也说成是“一念之差”。原来，在中国赫鲁晓夫看来，叛徒叛党也不过是“党员看问题的方法不同”，“处理问题的方法也有不同”而已。这是最无耻的叛徒辩护辞。
    中国赫鲁晓夫散布这些谬论，集中到一点，就是妄图篡改毛主席关于积极开展党内斗争的方针。马克思主义的辩证法认为，斗争是绝对的，统一是相对的；只有通过不断开展党内斗争，才能巩固党的统一和团结，才能使党更加无产阶级化。但是，中国赫鲁晓夫却提出一个不要斗争、只讲统一的反马克思主义的“党内和平”论。在延安整风时期，他就拚命宣扬什么“在我们党内是讲统一，讲和气，讲团结的这个方针”，还大肆鼓吹什么“中国人民的民族性就喜欢宽大”，“要有老人的心肠”，要“善与人同”。他把我们反对机会主义路线的正确斗争，统统诬蔑为“过火斗争”。如果按照中国赫鲁晓夫的这个“方针”，我们对机会主义路线只能“讲统一、讲和气”，而不能进行斗争。中国赫鲁晓夫这样做，就是从根本上否定党内两条路线的斗争，否定伟大的整风运动。
    一九五七年，正当我们党又一次开展全党的整风运动、右派分子乘机猖狂向党进攻的时候，中国赫鲁晓夫又跳了出来。在社会上，他到处散布“阶级斗争熄灭”论，要我们对资产阶级“强调同一性，不是强调斗争性”，竭力阻挠我们对右派进行反击。在党内，他又妄图篡改整风方针。他对他的门徒、大叛徒杨献珍说：“这个方针就是强调同一性。处理的方针可以着重它的同一性。因为原来是有同一性，我们主观上没有必要先强调斗争。……可以采取妥协的办法解决。”中国赫鲁晓夫的这个反革命方针，就是只许资产阶级右派向党猖狂进攻，不许党领导人民进行反击。后来反革命修正主义分子杨献珍就在中国赫鲁晓夫的指使下，精心炮制出了“合二而一”的反动谬论，恶毒地攻击毛主席的一分为二的革命辩证法。
    一九六二年，中国赫鲁晓夫在他重新修改发表的黑《修养》中，再一次大肆贩卖“党内和平”论，恶毒攻击我们的党内斗争是“机械的、主观的、横暴的”。他甚至把党中央的庐山会议对彭德怀右倾反党集团的斗争，污蔑为“重复了党的历史上残酷斗争，无情打击的错误”，居然狂叫什么“中央要负责任”，公然为右倾机会主义分子鸣冤叫屈，大刮右倾翻案风。
    中国赫鲁晓夫散布“党内和平”论，就是妄图束缚住广大党员的手脚，不准我们对各种非无产阶级思想进行斗争，不准我们对资产阶级反动路线进行斗争，不准我们对钻进党内的叛徒、特务、反革命分子进行斗争。使这一小撮阶级敌人能够长期隐藏下来，在阴暗的角落里搞破坏活动，明目张胆地推行反革命修正主义路线。事实也证明，他们是每时每刻都在向我们进行斗争的。他们打着红旗反红旗，不断反对毛主席的无产阶级司令部，反对和破坏毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，猖狂地进行篡党、篡军、篡政，大搞复辟资本主义的阴谋活动。历史证明，所谓“党内和平”论，就是极其阴险毒辣的反革命篡党谬论！
    三
    在党内斗争中，伟大领袖毛主席一贯教导我们要严格区分两类不同性质的矛盾，坚持对敌狠、对己和的原则。对于混进党内的阶级敌人和坚持错误路线而又死不改悔的顽固分子，坚决同他们斗争到底，直到把他们清洗出党。而对犯了错误的同志，只要他们不是坚持不改和累教不改的，都要采取“团结——批评和自我批评——团结”，“惩前毖后，治病救人”的方针。我们党正是由于坚持这样正确的党内斗争原则，才一次又一次地战胜资产阶级反动路线，在毛主席无产阶级革命路线的基础上，不断地加强了全党在思想上、政治上和组织上的团结和巩固。
    中国赫鲁晓夫长期以来，在党内斗争中一贯颠倒是非，混淆两类不同性质的矛盾。他在兜售“党内和平”论，高喊反对“过火斗争”，借以保护混进党内一小撮阶级敌人的同时，却对忠于毛主席的广大党员和革命同志采取残酷斗争、无情打击的反动政策。
    一九四七年，在土地改革运动中，中国赫鲁晓夫伙同大叛徒彭真等人搞了个臭名昭著的“搬石头”的反动政策。他们将广大农村基层干部列为“石头”，提出要“踢开基层干部”“斗干部就是斗地主”的反动口号，大喊大叫“不要怕干部党员出党，甚至大批出党”，“出去的就出去，打击的就打击”。对广大农村基层干部、党员这样狠下毒手，就是打击无产阶级和贫下中农，保护地主和资产阶级。
    一九六四年，在伟大的社会主义教育运动中，中国赫鲁晓夫又提出一条形“左”实右的资产阶级反动路线。为了保护党内一小撮走资派，他把两个阶级、两条道路的斗争，篡改成什么“四清与四不清的矛盾”，提出“有什么问题解决什么问题”，制造借口，转移斗争大方向，大整广大基层干部，大整广大社员，镇压革命群众。他指使他的老婆、资产阶级分子王××搞的所谓“桃园经验”，就是这种保护一小撮，打击一大片的反革命典型。当然，中国赫鲁晓夫这个阴谋没有得逞。毛主席亲自主持制订的“二十三条”，粉碎了中国赫鲁晓夫的资产阶级反动路线，使社会主义教育运动取得伟大的胜利。
    一直到这次无产阶级文化大革命运动初期，中国赫鲁晓夫眼看他们自己的末日来临，便急急忙忙变本加厉地再一次抛出他的资产阶级反动路线。正如毛主席一针见血地指出的，他“站在反动的资产阶级立场上，实行资产阶级专政，将无产阶级轰轰烈烈的文化大革命运动打下去，颠倒是非，混淆黑白，围剿革命派，压制不同意见，实行白色恐怖，自以为得意，长资产阶级的威风，灭无产阶级的志气，又何其毒也！”
    总之，中国赫鲁晓夫这个老反革命，几十年来一贯用残酷斗争、无情打击的手段来对待我们党，对待忠于毛主席的广大党员和干部，对抗毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。毛主席最近指出：“对广大人民群众是保护还是镇压，是共产党同国民党的根本区别，是无产阶级同资产阶级的根本区别，是无产阶级专政同资产阶级专政的根本区别。”这就无情地揭露了中国赫鲁晓夫资产阶级反动路线的反革命本质。我们必须遵照毛主席的伟大教导，彻底粉碎中国赫鲁晓夫打击一大片，保护一小撮的反动政策，彻底肃清其流毒。坚决保护广大党员和革命同志，对于那些犯有这样那样错误的同志，就是要“从团结的愿望出发，经过批评或者斗争使矛盾得到解决，从而在新的基础上达到新的团结。”而要打击的，是极少数混进党内的阶级敌人。

    伟大导师毛主席最近深刻地指出：“无产阶级文化大革命，实质上是在社会主义条件下，无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命，是中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续，是无产阶级和资产阶级阶级斗争的继续。”
    这场伟大的政治大革命，同时也是一场伟大的党内大斗争。在伟大领袖毛主席亲自发动和领导下，我们党组织亿万革命群众，彻底清算了几十年来以中国赫鲁晓夫为总代表的反革命修正主义路线，彻底摧毁了暗藏在无产阶级专政机构内部的、以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部，揪出了一小撮钻进我们党内的叛徒、特务和反革命修正主义分子，他们就是国民党反动派和资产阶级在我们党内的代理人。在这个伟大的运动中，使许多犯错误的干部得到挽救，广大党员受到最深刻的教育和锻炼。无产阶级文化大革命锻炼、培养了大批无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于毛泽东思想，无限忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的无产阶级先进分子，涌现出一大批新的骨干力量。无产阶级文化大革命是我们党内斗争最大的课堂，把我们党锻炼成为无产阶级革命的坚强堡垒。
    我们党的历史，揭示了一个伟大的真理：毛泽东思想指导下的党内斗争，永远是党的生命。毛主席教导我们：“党组织应是无产阶级先进分子所组成，应能领导无产阶级和革命群众对于阶级敌人进行战斗的朝气蓬勃的先锋队组织。”我们一定要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，全面落实毛主席一系列的最新指示，坚决保护广大革命群众，稳、准、狠地打击一小撮叛徒、特务、死不改悔的走资派和一切反革命分子，把党内两条路线的斗争进行到底，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利！
