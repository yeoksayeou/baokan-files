New soldiers rely on what to "take over their positions"?

The counter-revolutionary revisionist element Luo Ruicheng repeatedly shouted about how technology is the "real skill," the "hard work," and how "only talking about class consciousness, class stance, clear stance, clear banner, clear enemy and friend boundaries, clear love and hate, only this set, and our weapons in hand cannot be well grasped, technically not hard, ... at least not completely." and so on. This scoundrel, saying all this, is pushing the "technology first" black goods, attempting to use this to attack proletarian politics, replacing the proletarian military line with the bourgeois military line.

Whether to emphasize proletarian politics or military technology, this is the focal point of the struggle between the two military lines, reflected in various aspects of work. For example, whenever old soldiers are demobilized and old cadres are transferred, and a large number of new soldiers and new cadres are added, how can new crew members "take over their positions"? We believe that we should help new comrades quickly "take over their positions." The question is, what do they rely on to "take over their positions"? What should be prioritized? This reflects the struggle between two military thoughts. We firmly prioritize emphasizing proletarian politics, actively learning and applying Mao Zedong Thought, and focusing on the ideological revolution of people. As soon as new recruits arrive, we first hold Mao Zedong Thought study classes, organize the study of the "Three Articles," encourage old soldiers to share their experiences of actively learning and applying Chairman Mao's works, especially focusing on the "use" aspect; and spread the fighting style of emphasizing proletarian politics and diligently training combat skills. We also organize old and new soldiers together to criticize China's Khrushchev, as well as Peng Dehuai and Luo Ruicheng's reactionary military views such as "military first," "technology first," and "military and politics take turns emphasizing." In this way, new soldiers, as soon as they enlist, receive education on the struggle between the two military lines, understanding that the glorious tradition of our military construction is to emphasize Mao Zedong Thought and proletarian politics, and to focus on the ideological revolution of people.

"Without the correct political viewpoint, it is like having no soul." For new recruits, we must first cultivate in them a selfless spirit. Some new soldiers come to the navy with the idea of just learning a set of skills, so they are willing to go to new boats to learn skills faster, but are not willing to go to old boats to be "auxiliary engine crew." Some new soldiers, when they first enlist, get seasick and vomit badly when they go to sea, and feel that being in the navy is too hard. In response to these thoughts, we launched the "Two Remembrances and Three Examinations" education campaign, guiding new soldiers to remember bitterness and sweetness. They deeply reflect on their souls, break down selfishness and establish public spirit, understanding what exploitation is, what revolution is, and clarifying the fundamental issue of for whom they are serving in the military and for whom they are revolting.

Forging a red ideology can train good skills. The former deputy platoon leader Yang Hanwen, after being promoted from soldier to boat captain, although his technical foundation was weak, he took the lead in actively learning and applying Chairman Mao's works, with Mao Zedong Thought as the banner, diligently training skills, humbly learning from others' experiences, and making rapid progress. In a training session, his fast boat's dual rudder malfunctioned. At that time, the wind and waves were relatively large, and it was nighttime. He followed Chairman Mao's teaching on being extremely responsible in work, remaining calm and clever, successfully navigating through the complex waterway and bringing the boat back. New soldier gunner Chai Jinhua, with an endless heart loyal to Chairman Mao, and a deep hatred for China's Khrushchev, diligently learned and applied Mao Zedong Thought, seized every training opportunity, and diligently trained hard skills. In just over a month, he hit the target in his first live-fire shooting.

Countless examples of emphasizing proletarian politics prove: new soldiers "taking over their positions" is fundamentally not relying on technology, but on Mao Zedong Thought, on people's political awareness. Only by forging a solid ideology can one train solid skills; only by continuously improving the unit's class struggle and line struggle awareness, and making the political atmosphere thick, can one adhere to the correct political direction.

    新战士靠什么“顶战位”？
    南海舰队某部　三中队党支部
    反革命修正主义分子罗瑞卿一再叫嚷什么技术是“真本事”、“硬功夫”，什么“只是讲阶级觉悟，阶级立场，立场坚定，旗帜鲜明，敌我界限很清楚，爱憎分明，只有这一套，而我们手中的武器不能很好掌握，技术上过不了硬，……至少是不完全。”等等。这个坏蛋，说来说去，都是在推行“技术第一”的黑货，妄图以此来冲击无产阶级政治，用资产阶级军事路线代替无产阶级军事路线。
    突出无产阶级政治还是突出军事技术，这个两条军事路线斗争的焦点，反映在各项工作中。例如，每当老战士复员，老干部调走，新战士、新干部大量增加的时候，怎样使新艇员能“顶战位”呢？我们认为，应该帮助新同志尽快地能够“顶战位”，问题是靠什么来“顶战位”，把什么放在首位？这是两种建军思想斗争的反映。我们坚决把突出无产阶级政治、活学活用毛泽东思想，搞好人的思想革命化放在首位。新兵一到，我们先办毛泽东思想学习班，组织学习“老三篇”，发动老战士向新同志介绍活学活用毛主席著作在“用”字上狠下功夫的经验；传播突出无产阶级政治、苦练杀敌本领的战斗作风。我们还组织新老战士一起批判中国赫鲁晓夫以及彭德怀、罗瑞卿的“军事第一”、“技术第一”、“军事政治轮流突出”等等反动军事观点。这样，新战士一入伍就受到两条军事路线斗争的教育，懂得了我军建设的光荣传统是突出毛泽东思想，突出无产阶级政治，抓人的思想革命化。
      “没有正确的政治观点，就等于没有灵魂。”对新入伍的战士首先要培养他们一心为公的思想。有的新战士只抱着学一套技术的想法来当海军，因此，愿意到新艇，以便更快地学到技术，而不愿意到老艇当“号外轮机兵”。有的新战士刚入伍时，一出海晕船呕吐很厉害，就觉得当海军太艰苦了。针对这些活思想，我们开展了“两忆三查”教育运动，引导新战士忆苦思甜。他们狠触自己的灵魂，破私立公，懂得了什么叫剥削，什么叫革命，明确了为谁当兵，为谁革命这个根本问题。
    炼红思想，就能练好技术。原副中队长杨汉文同志从战士提升为艇长后，虽然技术基础差，但他带头活学活用毛主席著作，以毛泽东思想挂帅，苦练技术，虚心学习别人的经验，进步很快。在一次训练中，他所在的快艇双舵失灵。当时风浪较大，又是夜间，他遵照毛主席对工作要极端负责任的教导，沉着、机智，顺利通过复杂的航道把艇开了回来。新战士枪炮兵崔金华同志怀着一颗无限忠于毛主席的红心，带着对中国赫鲁晓夫的满腔仇恨，努力活学活用毛泽东思想，抓紧每一次训练时间，苦练过硬技术，只一个多月的时间，第一次实弹射击，就命中目标。
    无数突出无产阶级政治的事例证明：新战士“顶战位”，最根本的不是靠技术，而是靠毛泽东思想，靠人的政治觉悟。只有炼好过硬的思想，才能练好过硬的技术；只有不断提高部队的阶级斗争和路线斗争觉悟，把政治空气搞得浓浓的，才能坚持正确的政治方向。
