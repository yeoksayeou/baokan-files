Under the guidance of the great leader Chairman Mao's policy of "grasp revolution, promote production," a fiberboard factory in Wuxing County, Zhejiang Province, which is designed, manufactured, and installed independently by our country with a relatively high degree of continuous and automated production, has been successfully constructed and has already produced its first batch of products.

The fiberboard factory has been tested and approved by relevant departments, with product quality and technical economic indicators meeting national requirements. The annual production capacity can exceed the design capacity, with low labor intensity and high efficiency. The completion of this factory marks a new level in China's fiberboard manufacturing industry.
