Under the strong resistance and boycott by the broad masses of peasants, the reactionary Indian government's plan to seize grain has failed. The amount of grain "procured" this grain year has only reached about half of the set target.

New Delhi, July 8 (Xinhua) — The reactionary Indian government's violent seizure of grain in rural areas has met with resistance from the broad masses of peasants. The reactionary Indian government's plan to seize grain has fallen through.

The mouthpiece of the reactionary Indian government, the Indian News Agency, had to admit on the 6th that the government's "procurement" of rice and autumn crops is far from reaching the originally set targets. At present, most of the activities for "procuring" rice this grain year have ended, but the reactionary Indian government has only "procured" about 280 million tons of rice, and all autumn crops have only "procured" about 360 million tons. This figure is only about half of the target set by the Indian central government and various state governments.

The Indian bourgeois newspaper "The Statesman" revealed in February this year that the Indian government's plan to seize grain had failed, one of the reasons being the resistance of the peasants. The newspaper reported from Siliguri in North Bengal's Darjeeling district that Siliguri is the only rice-producing area in Darjeeling district. As the government's deadline for seizing grain approached, only about 1,500 tons of rice were seized, while the target was 10,000 tons. The report revealed that in this area where the peasant struggle was intensifying, "the political situation was unstable, affecting the procurement campaign." "The law and order situation in this state made the police and civil servants too busy to effectively deal with other issues."

"The Statesman" also revealed that in North Bengal, the county with the "best" procurement results, Siddharthnagar, also only completed half of the target. It was revealed that the reactionary authorities of West Bengal decided to mobilize the entire reactionary ruling apparatus, police, and the so-called "civil defense system" of reactionary landlord armed forces starting from March 1 to intensify the use of violence to seize grain. However, the more the reactionary Indian authorities intensified the use of violence to seize grain, the more they faced strong resistance from the peasants. The recent official disclosure of the results of grain seizure in India has declared the failure of this violent seizure policy.

    在广大农民强烈反抗和抵制下
    印度反动政府搜刮粮食计划破产
    本粮食年度“收购”的粮食只达到规定目标一半左右
    新华社八日讯　新德里消息：印度反动政府用暴力在农村搜刮粮食的行动，遭到广大农民的抵抗。印度反动政府拟订的搜刮计划落了空。
    印度反动政府的喉舌印度报业托辣斯六日不得不承认，这个政府“收购”的大米和秋季作物，远远达不到原定目标。目前，本粮食年度“收购”大米的大部分活动已经结束，但是，印度反动政府只“收购”到二百八十多万吨大米，全部秋季作物只“收购”到三百六十万吨。这个数字只达到印度中央政府和各邦政府规定的目标的一半左右。
    印度资产阶级报纸《政治家报》今年二月间曾经透露，印度政府搜刮粮食的计划落空，原因之一是农民的反抗。这家报纸发自西孟加拉邦北部大吉岭县西里古里的消息说，西里古里是大吉岭县唯一产大米的地区，在政府搜刮粮食限期快到的时候，搜刮到的大米不到一千五百吨，而指标是一万吨。报道透露，在这个农民斗争激烈开展的地区，“政局不稳定影响了收购运动”。“这个邦的治安状况使警察和文官太忙了，以致不能有效地应付其它问题”。
    《政治家报》还透露，在西孟加拉邦北部“收购”成绩“最好”的一个县西迪纳吉普尔，也只完成指标的一半。据透露，西孟加拉邦反动当局决定从三月一日起动员整个反动统治机构、警察和所谓“民防系统”的反动地主武装，加紧用暴力进行搜刮。但是，印度反动当局越加紧使用暴力进行搜刮，就越遭到农民强烈的抵抗。最近印度官方透露的搜刮粮食的结果，宣告了这种暴力搜刮政策的破产。
