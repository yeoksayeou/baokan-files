Today, we are even happier to visit the Beijing Knitting Factory, which has achieved great successes in the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat. On behalf of the Vietnamese people, I extend fraternal greetings of solidarity and struggle to the Chinese people. You have introduced to us the situation of the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat and the achievements you have made, which makes us very happy. We hope that you will follow Chairman Mao's teachings, better grasp revolution and promote production, and achieve greater successes in the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat. We wish for the eternal friendship between the peoples and working classes of Vietnam and China to last forever."
