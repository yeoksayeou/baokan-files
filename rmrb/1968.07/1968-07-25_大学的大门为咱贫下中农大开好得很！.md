We are filled with excitement as we listen over and over again on the radio to the latest instructions from our great leader Chairman Mao: "Universities should still be run, and here I am mainly talking about universities of science and engineering which should still be run. But the system should be shortened, education should be revolutionized, and proletarian politics should be in command. The path should be that of Shanghai Machine Tool Factory, which trains technical personnel from among workers. Students should be selected from among workers and peasants who have practical experience, sent to school for a few years, and then sent back to production practice." Every word and sentence in Chairman Mao's latest instructions shines with golden light. They express the thoughts of us broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants. Chairman Mao's latest instructions point out the direction and path for the proletarian educational revolution, serving as a battle program for carrying the proletarian educational revolution through to the end and a powerful ideological weapon for opposing revisionism and preventing revisionism. We, the poor and lower-middle peasants of Dazhai, shout a thousand and ten thousand times in praise of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, hailing them as excellent, truly excellent!

Our great leader Chairman Mao has long pointed out clearly: "Education must serve proletarian politics and must be combined with productive labor. The working people must become knowledgeable, and intellectuals must become laborers." However, in order to realize his dream of restoring capitalism, the Chinese Khrushchev has frantically pushed the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line, long using bourgeois intellectuals to control our schools, and keeping out a large number of workers and peasants with practical experience. Some young people have been poisoned by the revisionist educational line, becoming detached from proletarian politics, from reality, and from the masses. Those who study industry do not know how to operate machines, and those who study agriculture do not know how to farm. They have no skills but look down on the working people, and they are full of thoughts of personal gain. Schools that train young people in this way are not needed by workers, nor are they needed by poor and lower-middle peasants.

The publication of Chairman Mao's latest instructions further pronounces the death sentence on the bourgeois educational system and on the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line. We must definitely follow the teachings of our great leader Chairman Mao and launch a great revolution on the educational front, transforming the old type of universities, which are detached from proletarian politics, from reality, and from the masses, into universities that serve proletarian politics, are combined with productive labor, and are closely linked with the masses. We must transform the old type of universities, which admit students based on examination scores, into universities that select students from among workers and peasants, send them to school for a few years, and then send them back to production practice, issuing "certificates of qualification" to them from workers and poor and lower-middle peasants. We must transform the old type of universities, which instill bourgeois thoughts of personal gain in students, into universities that cultivate in students the thought of wholeheartedly serving the people. University students must be transformed from being detached from reality, from production, and from the masses, and from being confined in big cities, into being trained among the workers and peasants, in the great storms and waves of class struggle, and on the front lines of production. In this way, we will fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, carry out the most thorough revolution in the educational system, and we believe that in the not-too-distant future, the whole country will have a large number of university students, both workers and peasants, who have proletarian awareness and practical experience, and who are the first generation of new-type university students in the world.

Chairman Mao's latest instructions point out the direction and path for the educational revolution. However, walking this path will not be smooth sailing; class enemies will sabotage, and old habits will obstruct. Therefore, the task before us is to fight. We must fight against class enemies, against old habits, and against the bourgeois educational system. How should we fight? The main thing is to follow Chairman Mao's teachings: "Without destruction, there can be no construction. Destruction means criticism, means revolution. Destruction means to argue, and arguing is construction. Destruction comes first, and construction is within it." We must carry out thorough revolutionary criticism, criticize the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line of the Chinese Khrushchev to the point of stench, and establish Chairman Mao's proletarian educational line firmly, smash the bourgeois educational system thoroughly, and resolutely walk the path pointed out by Chairman Mao of combining with workers, peasants, and soldiers, carry the educational revolution through to the end, and win a complete victory in the proletarian cultural revolution.

    大学的大门为咱贫下中农大开好得很！
    山西省昔阳县大寨大队党支部书记　陈永贵
    我们满怀激动的心情，从广播里一遍又一遍地收听了伟大领袖毛主席的最新指示：“大学还是要办的，我这里主要说的是理工科大学还要办，但学制要缩短，教育要革命，要无产阶级政治挂帅，走上海机床厂从工人中培养技术人员的道路。要从有实践经验的工人农民中间选拔学生，到学校学几年以后，又回到生产实践中去。”毛主席这一字字句句闪金光的最新指示，说出了我们广大贫下中农的心里话。毛主席的最新指示，指出了无产阶级教育革命的道路和方向，是把无产阶级教育革命进行到底的战斗纲领，是反修防修的强大思想武器。我们大寨贫下中农千遍万遍地欢呼毛主席最新指示的发表，欢呼毛主席最新指示好得很，实在好得很！
    我们伟大领袖毛主席早就明确指出：“教育必须为无产阶级政治服务，必须同生产劳动相结合。劳动人民要知识化，知识分子要劳动化。”可是，中国赫鲁晓夫为了实现复辟资本主义的迷梦，疯狂地推行反革命修正主义教育路线，长期以来用资产阶级知识分子统治我们的学校，把大批有实践经验的工人、农民堵在大学门外。有些青年人受了修正主义教育路线的毒害，脱离无产阶级政治，脱离实际，脱离群众，学工的不会开机器，学农的不会种地，本事没有还看不起劳动人民，名利思想一大堆。把青年人培养成这个样子的学校，我们工人不需要，贫下中农不需要。
    毛主席最新指示的发表，进一步宣判了资产阶级教育制度的死刑，宣判了反革命修正主义教育路线的死刑。我们一定要遵循伟大领袖毛主席的教导，在教育战线上开展一场大革命，把过去那种脱离无产阶级政治、脱离实际、脱离群众的大学，变成为无产阶级政治服务，同生产劳动相结合，密切联系群众的大学。把过去那种招考学生凭分数的大学，变成从工人农民中间选拔学生，学几年以后又回到生产实践中去，由工人、贫下中农发给“合格证书”的大学。把过去那种向学生灌输资产阶级名利思想的大学，变成培养学生树立全心全意为人民服务思想的大学。大学生要由脱离实际，脱离生产，脱离群众，钻在大城市，变成到工农群众中去培养，到阶级斗争的大风大浪里去培养，到生产第一线去培养。这样全面落实毛主席的这一最新指示，教育制度实行最彻底的革命，我们相信，不久的将来，全国将有一大批有无产阶级觉悟，有实践经验的由工人、农民成长起来的世界上第一代新型的工人大学生，农民大学生。
    毛主席的最新指示，为我们指出了教育革命的方向，指明了前进的道路。但是要走这条道路，不会是一帆风顺的，阶级敌人要破坏，旧的习惯势力要阻碍。因此，摆在我们面前的任务就是要斗。同阶级敌人斗，同旧的习惯势力斗，同资产阶级的教育制度斗。怎么斗呢？最主要的是遵照毛主席“不破不立。破，就是批判，就是革命。破，就要讲道理，讲道理就是立，破字当头，立也就在其中了”的教导，深入开展革命大批判，把中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义教育路线批得臭臭的，把毛主席的无产阶级教育路线立得牢牢的，彻底砸烂资产阶级教育制度，坚决走毛主席指出的同工农兵结合的道路，把教育革命进行到底，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
