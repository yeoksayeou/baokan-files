	Australian students angrily shout: No to conscription!
	Two thousand university students in Sydney demonstrate against the reactionary government's conscription of young people to serve as cannon fodder for U.S. imperialism's invasion of Vietnam

	New China News Agency, Melbourne, July 10 — Two thousand university students in Sydney defied the ruling authorities' ban on July 9 and took to the streets to demonstrate against U.S. imperialism's invasion of Vietnam, against the intensification of conscription of Australian youth to serve as cannon fodder in the U.S. war of aggression in Vietnam under the "National Service Act Amendment," against police brutality, and against the government's threat to revoke scholarships of students arrested during the demonstration.

	The demonstrators marched from the University of Sydney to the city center, angrily shouting, "No to conscription!" "Don't be cannon fodder for the U.S. aggressors!" "Withdraw Australian troops from Vietnam!" "Drive out the puppet government!"

	New China News Agency, Melbourne, July 10 — Six hundred fuel truck drivers in Sydney, defying a court order, continued their strike on July 9, which had begun seven days earlier, demanding a wage increase.

	This strike has dealt a significant blow to the capitalists. Due to the strike, fuel supply in Sydney has been disrupted, public buses and taxis have stopped running as of July 10, many stores are unable to deliver goods, and some airlines have had to reduce their flights.
