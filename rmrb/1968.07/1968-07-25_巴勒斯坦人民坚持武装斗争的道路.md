The heroic Palestinian people have been waging a long and courageous struggle against the aggression of U.S. imperialism and its lackey, Israel. Recently, inspired by the favorable situation of the world people's revolutionary struggle, they have demonstrated their brave fighting spirit by launching attacks on the Israeli aggressors and achieving many victories.

The Palestinian people insist on armed struggle and actively engage in guerrilla warfare, inflicting heavy blows on the U.S.-Israeli aggressors. Since the U.S.-Israeli aggression war last June, Palestinian guerrillas have conducted over 400 battles, killing and wounding more than 4,000 Israeli aggressors. The areas of guerrilla activity are expanding. The flames of armed struggle have spread across the vast rural and mountainous regions of the entire Israeli-occupied zone, even reaching the heart of Israeli rule in the vicinity of Tel Aviv and the southern port of Eilat. Palestinian guerrilla fighters have demonstrated the superior mobility and flexibility of guerrilla warfare, using homemade bombs, landmines, and various weapons to ambush enemy troops, attack enemy barracks, and sabotage enemy military facilities, leaving the enemy in a state of chaos and disarray.

Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "Regardless of the size of a country, as long as the people are fully mobilized, firmly rely on the people, and wage a people's war, any powerful enemy can be defeated."

The practice of the Palestinian people's struggle shows that in the Arab region, the truly powerful are the Palestinians and the broad masses of the Arab people who dare to fight; the seemingly powerful U.S.-Israeli reactionaries are nothing but paper tigers with strong exteriors but weak interiors. Despite receiving strong military and economic support from U.S. imperialism, the Israeli aggressors are actually facing numerous difficulties and are very weak. Their mad military expansion has made Israel's front lines longer and longer, with insufficient troops. Military expenditures are skyrocketing, the economic situation is worsening, foreign debts are increasing, domestic inflation is rampant, production is declining, and unemployment has reached 150,000. The reactionary Zionist policy and the brutal oppression and suppression of the Arab people have aroused increasingly strong resistance from the Arab people. The mass movement of the Palestinian people against U.S. imperialism and its tool, Israel, is surging.

Under the heavy blows of the Palestinian people's armed struggle, the Israeli aggressors are having an increasingly difficult time. The Israeli ruling clique is in a state of panic. Israeli Defense Minister Dayan had to admit, "The war against 'Fatah' has cost us a lot of effort and many casualties." Israeli Prime Minister Eshkol also lamented that the battles between the Israeli army and the Palestinian guerrillas are "more arduous" than the aggression war launched by the U.S. and Israel last June.

The Palestinian people and the broad masses of the Arab people have increasingly come to recognize the great truth pointed out by Chairman Mao: "Political power grows out of the barrel of a gun." They firmly hold high the banner of armed struggle, fear no violence, dare to fight, and actively carry out guerrilla activities in the enemy-occupied areas, opening up new battlefields to strike the enemy and establishing mobile bases. The Palestinian guerrillas have taken root among the Arab people who are deeply suffering from national oppression, gaining strong support from the broad masses of the Palestinian people and the people of various Arab countries. According to reports, this year alone, a large number of Palestinian and Arab youth have applied to join the "Fatah"-affiliated military organization, the "Storm" commando unit.

The Palestinian people resolutely oppose all so-called "political solutions" that compromise with the U.S.-Israeli aggressors. They have come to realize through practice that U.S. imperialism is the most vicious enemy, and the Soviet revisionist traitor clique is the number one accomplice of U.S. imperialism. The so-called "political solution" plotted by the U.S. and the Soviet Union is a political fraud aimed at strangling the Arab national liberation movement. Recently, the leaders of "Fatah" have repeatedly reiterated that the Palestinian issue can only be resolved through armed struggle and have severely condemned the activities of the United Nations "envoy" Jarring in the Middle East to plot a "political solution." They have expressed their determination to recover the lost lands by force until final victory. This expresses the iron will of the Palestinian people and the Arab people to persist in revolutionary armed struggle and to carry the struggle against the U.S.-Israeli aggressors to the end.

U.S. imperialism and its number one accomplice, the Soviet revisionist traitor clique, have always been enemies of the Palestinian people and the Arab people. They collude with each other, acting in cahoots, supporting and inciting the Israeli aggressors, and using every means to try to strangle the armed struggle of the Palestinian people and extinguish the flames of the Arab people's anti-imperialist struggle.

In the face of the continuous exposure and increasing failure of the U.S.-Soviet "political solution" plot, the head of the Soviet revisionist traitor clique, Kosygin, recently proposed a plan to supposedly "stop the arms race and disarm" in the Middle East. Just as U.S. imperialism is providing Israel with the latest weapons, including "Hawk" missiles, and encouraging Israel to continuously provoke the Arab people militarily, the Soviet revisionist traitor clique proposes so-called "stopping the arms race and disarmament." In essence, this is to disarm the Arab people in the face of the Israeli aggressors. This is a treacherous plot by the Soviet revisionist traitor clique in close collaboration with U.S. imperialism, openly betraying the Arab people, and attempting to strangle the armed struggle of the Arab people and force the Arab people to surrender to the aggressors. This is another major exposure of the ugly face of the Soviet revisionist traitors.

Our great leader Chairman Mao says: "The people are the decisive factor. Relying on the unity and struggle of the people, we must be able to defeat imperialism and its running dogs."

Recently, various anti-imperialist organizations in Palestine held a national committee meeting in Cairo. The representatives attending the meeting strongly condemned the aggression of U.S. imperialism and its tool, Israel, expressing the common wish of the Palestinian people and the Arab people to unite against imperialism, wage armed struggle, and liberate their homeland. The meeting also called on Arab countries and peoples to firmly support the armed struggle of the Palestinian people in material and moral terms.

The Palestinian people, after long and arduous exploration, have found the correct path to liberation through armed struggle. We are deeply convinced that as long as the Palestinian people and the Arab people hold high the banner of armed struggle, persist in progress, strengthen unity, dare to fight, and fear no difficulties, they will surely achieve final victory in the struggle against U.S. imperialism and its tool, Israel.

### 巴勒斯坦人民坚持武装斗争的道路

    巴勒斯坦人民坚持武装斗争的道路
    英雄的巴勒斯坦人民为反对美帝国主义及其走狗以色列的侵略，进行了长期的英勇斗争。最近，在世界人民革命斗争大好形势的鼓舞下，他们发扬勇敢战斗的精神，向以色列侵略者发动进攻，取得许多胜利。
    巴勒斯坦人民坚持武装斗争，积极开展游击战，沉重打击了美以侵略者。从去年六月美以发动侵略战争以来，巴勒斯坦游击队先后进行了四百多次战斗，打死打伤以色列侵略军四千名以上。游击队的活动地区日益扩大。武装斗争的烈火遍及整个以色列占领区的广大农村和山区，甚至达到以色列统治的心脏特拉维夫附近和南部港口埃拉特。巴勒斯坦游击战士发挥了游击战争机动灵活的优越性，用自己制造的炸弹、地雷和各种武器，到处伏击敌军，袭击敌军兵营，破坏敌人各种军事设施，打得敌人穷于应付，狼狈不堪。
    我们的伟大导师毛主席教导说：“国家不分大小，只要充分动员人民，坚决依靠人民，进行人民战争，任何强大的敌人都是可以打败的。”
    巴勒斯坦人民斗争的实践表明，在阿拉伯地区，真正强大的是敢于斗争的巴勒斯坦人民和广大的阿拉伯人民；貌似强大的美以反动派不过是外强中干的纸老虎。尽管受到美帝国主义从军事上和经济上的大力扶植，以色列侵略者实际上是困难重重，十分虚弱的。疯狂的军事扩张，使得以色列的战线越来越长，兵力远远不足。军费开支猛增，经济情况越来越不妙，外债日益增加，国内通货膨胀，生产衰退，失业人口已达十五万之多。反动的犹太复国主义政策和对阿拉伯人民的残暴迫害和镇压，激起了阿拉伯人民越来越强烈的反抗，巴勒斯坦人民反对美帝及其侵略工具以色列的群众运动正在不断高涨。
    在巴勒斯坦人民武装斗争的沉重打击下，以色列侵略者的日子越来越不好过了。以色列统治集团惊慌失措。以色列国防部长达扬不得不承认，“同‘法塔赫’作战，使我们花了很大的力气，损失了许多人。”以色列总理艾希科尔也哀叹，以色列军队目前同巴勒斯坦游击队进行的战斗，比去年六月美以发动的侵略战争
  “更加艰苦”。
    巴勒斯坦人民和广大的阿拉伯人民，从斗争中越来越认识到毛主席指出的“枪杆子里面出政权”的伟大真理，相信人民战争是解放巴勒斯坦的唯一道路。他们高举武装斗争的大旗，不畏强暴，敢于战斗，在敌占区积极展开游击活动，开辟打击敌人的新战场，并建立了流动根据地。巴勒斯坦游击队扎根在深受民族压迫的阿拉伯人民中间，得到广大巴勒斯坦人民和阿拉伯各国人民的大力支持。据报道，今年以来，又有大批的巴勒斯坦青年和阿拉伯青年申请参加“法塔赫”所属军事组织“暴风”突击队。
    巴勒斯坦人民坚决反对一切向美以侵略者妥协的所谓“政治解决”办法，他们从实践中认识到美帝国主义是最凶恶的敌人，苏修叛徒集团是美帝国主义的头号帮凶，美苏策划的所谓“政治解决”，是旨在扼杀阿拉伯民族解放运动的政治大骗局。最近，“法塔赫”的领导人一再重申，巴勒斯坦问题只有通过武装斗争才能解决，并且严厉谴责联合国“特使”雅林在中东进行“政治解决”的阴谋活动，表示决心用武力收复失地，直到最后胜利。这表达了巴勒斯坦人民和阿拉伯人民坚持革命武装斗争，把反对美以侵略者的斗争进行到底的钢铁意志。
    美帝国主义及其头号帮凶苏修叛徒集团，一贯与巴勒斯坦人民和阿拉伯人民为敌，他们互相勾结，狼狈为奸，扶植并怂恿以色列侵略者，千方百计想要扼杀巴勒斯坦人民的武装斗争，扑灭阿拉伯人民反帝斗争的烈火。
    在美苏的“政治解决”阴谋不断被揭露和日益破产的情况下，苏修叛徒集团头子柯西金最近提出了一项要在中东实行所谓“停止军备竞赛和裁军”的“建议”。正当美帝国主义向以色列提供包括“隼式”导弹在内的最新武器，纵容以色列不断向阿拉伯人民进行军事挑衅的情况下，苏修叛徒集团竟提出所谓“停止军备竞赛和裁军”，实质上就是要阿拉伯人民在以色列侵略者面前解除武装。这是苏修叛徒集团同美帝密切配合，公开背叛阿拉伯人民，妄图扼杀阿拉伯人民武装斗争，压迫阿拉伯人民向侵略者投降的毒计，是苏修叛徒丑恶面目的又一次大暴露。
    我们的伟大导师毛主席说：“人民是决定的因素，依靠人民的团结和斗争，必能战胜帝国主义和他们的走狗”。
    最近，巴勒斯坦各反帝组织在开罗举行了全国委员会大会。参加会议的代表强烈谴责美帝国主义及其工具以色列的侵略，表达了巴勒斯坦人民和阿拉伯人民团结反帝、进行武装斗争和解放家园的共同愿望。会议还号召阿拉伯国家和人民在物质上和道义上坚决支持巴勒斯坦人民的武装斗争。
    巴勒斯坦人民经过长期的艰苦的摸索，已经找到了武装斗争这一赢得解放的正确的道路。我们深信，只要巴勒斯坦人民和阿拉伯人民高举武装斗争的旗帜，坚持进步，加强团结，敢于战斗，不怕困难，就一定能够在反对美帝国主义及其侵略工具以色列的斗争中，取得最后的胜利。
