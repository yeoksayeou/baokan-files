The heroic patriotic military and civilians of Khammouane Province in Laos have bravely fought in the first six months of this year, eliminating over a thousand enemies and seizing more than 130 pieces of various weapons. They have liberated nine townships with a population of over 8,000 people.

According to broadcasts by the Pathet Lao radio station, on June 16, local forces and guerrillas in Luang Prabang Province intercepted a bandit ship on the Mekong River, killing 30 enemies on the spot and injuring many more. On June 20, local forces and guerrillas in this province killed and injured some enemies in anti-bandit operations.

According to broadcasts by the Pathet Lao radio station, under the powerful strikes of the patriotic military and civilians of Laos, the right-wing military forces of Laos, which had been besieged in Lakhone Town, Saravane Province, were forced to hastily withdraw from the Lakhone area on July 19. Currently, Lakhone Town has been recovered by the patriotic military and civilians of Laos.

The broadcast said that the panicked enemy forces, in their haste to escape, did not have time to destroy their barracks, strongholds, and weapon depots.

The broadcast pointed out that Lakhone was originally a town in the liberated area of the Lao Patriotic Front. In early 1967, it was illegally occupied by U.S. imperialism and its lackeys, the reactionary regime in Vientiane. The broadcast said that the enemy's forced withdrawal from Lakhone is a new great victory for the patriotic military and civilians of Laos and a new heavy defeat for the enemy.

The broadcast finally pointed out that the enemy's forced withdrawal from the Lakhone area once again proves that U.S. imperialism and its lackeys are increasingly in a state of panic and despair, and they cannot escape the fate of complete failure.

According to a report by the Pathet Lao News Agency, the heroic patriotic military and civilians of Laos continued to launch consecutive attacks on the enemy in various battlefields in June, eliminating nearly 500 enemies and seizing more than 160 pieces of various weapons.

In the upper part of Laos, the patriotic military and civilians of Phongsaly Province eliminated nearly 100 bandits in June, further consolidating and developing the liberated area. The patriotic military and civilians of Khammouane Province also eliminated more than 150 enemies and seized more than 80 pieces of various weapons.

In the lower part of Laos, the patriotic military and civilians thwarted the enemy's plot to "eat away" at the liberated area during the rainy season, eliminating more than 200 enemies during this period.
