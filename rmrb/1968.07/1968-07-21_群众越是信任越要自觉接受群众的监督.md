After the establishment of the revolutionary committee of the Beijing School of Finance and Trade, I joined the revolutionary three-in-one leadership cadre. Because the People's Liberation Army, founded and led by Chairman Mao and directly commanded by Vice Chairman Lin, enjoys high prestige among the people, the broad masses of teachers and students also trust me to a considerable extent. Many issues are decided by me. Over time, I unconsciously developed a sense of complacency, always thinking that I was more capable than the masses and unable to humbly listen to their opinions.

This year in May, a group of revolutionary teachers and students posted a big-character poster to the revolutionary committee and the military training team, criticizing the committee and the team for "not effectively highlighting proletarian politics and not closely following Chairman Mao's latest instructions." They even raised the issue to the level of principles regarding the attitude towards Chairman Mao's instructions.

Seeing this big-character poster, I was taken aback and felt somewhat resentful. I thought: The revolutionary committee and the military training team have done a lot of work. We have promptly conveyed Chairman Mao's latest instructions, so how can it be said that we have not highlighted proletarian politics and not closely followed the latest instructions? I did not adopt an active attitude towards the teachers and students' big-character poster. Instead, I thought that the masses were looking at the problem one-sidedly.

The big-character poster was posted at the entrance of the revolutionary committee's office, visible as soon as one enters. Seeing it repeatedly, my thoughts could not help but be stirred. Chairman Mao teaches us: "Because we are serving the people, we should not fear criticism and correction from others. No matter who points out our mistakes, we should correct them if they are right. If your methods are beneficial to the people, we will adopt them." The broad revolutionary teachers and students actively put forward opinions and criticisms to the revolutionary committee. This is a concrete manifestation of their loyalty to Chairman Mao, to Mao Zedong Thought, and to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. It is a concrete manifestation of their responsibility to the revolutionary cause and also the greatest trust, love, and support that the broad revolutionary teachers and students have for the newly established revolutionary committee. This is not a bad thing but a great thing. Whether the revolutionary committee can truly accept the masses' supervision and correctly handle the masses' criticisms and opinions is not a matter of work style or methods but a fundamental issue of standing and line. It is also a fundamental issue in building and consolidating the revolutionary committee. In his series of latest instructions on revolutionary committees, Chairman Mao especially emphasizes that the committee should closely connect with the masses and build a "revolutionary and mass-connected leadership cadre." As a representative of the People's Liberation Army, I should first seriously implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions and set an example in closely connecting with the masses, accepting their supervision, and correctly handling their criticisms.

Once my attitude was corrected, I carefully reconsidered the masses' criticisms of the revolutionary committee and felt that we lacked specific arrangements and detailed work in implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions. The more I thought about it, the more I felt that the masses' criticisms were affectionate and their opinions were correct.

With my understanding deepened, I proposed to the revolutionary committee to study the masses' opinions and make a specific plan to implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions. At the same time, we studied how the members of the revolutionary committee could maintain and strengthen their close connection with the masses and listen to their opinions and criticisms. Later, at a school-wide meeting of revolutionary teachers and students, I made a public self-criticism on this issue and praised the revolutionary teachers and students who put forward criticisms. I praised their firm implementation and execution of Chairman Mao's latest instructions and their revolutionary spirit of seriously supervising and enthusiastically supporting the work of the revolutionary committee.

Through this incident, I deeply felt that every member of the revolutionary committee must follow Chairman Mao's teachings and never detach ourselves from the masses. The more the masses trust and support us, the more we must be humble and cautious, voluntarily accepting the masses' criticisms and supervision. Only in this way can we correctly implement the party's policies and lead the revolutionary masses to advance along Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

    群众越是信任越要自觉接受群众的监督
    北京财贸学校革委会主任　曾志强
    财贸学校革命委员会成立以后，我参加了革命三结合的领导班子。由于毛主席亲手缔造和领导的、林副主席直接指挥的人民解放军，在人民群众中享有崇高的威信，广大师生对我也比较信任，有些问题都是我说了算。时间长了，自己就不自觉地滋长了一种自满情绪，总认为自己比群众高明，不能虚心听取群众的意见。
    今年五月，一部分革命师生给革命委员会和军训团贴了大字报，批评革委会和军训团“没有很好地突出无产阶级政治，对毛主席的最新指示跟得不紧”，甚至把问题提到对待毛主席指示采取什么态度的原则高度。
    看了这张大字报，我感到很突然，心里也不大服气。我觉得：革委会和军训团还是做了不少工作的，我们及时传达了毛主席的最新指示，怎么能说没有突出无产阶级政治，对最新指示跟得不紧呢？对革命师生的这张大字报，我不是采取积极欢迎的态度，相反地，却认为群众看问题片面。
    大字报贴在革委会办公室，一进门就可以看到。看的遍数多了，自己的思想也不能不触动。毛主席教导我们：“因为我们是为人民服务的，所以，我们如果有缺点，就不怕别人批评指出。不管是什么人，谁向我们指出都行。只要你说得对，我们就改正。你说的办法对人民有好处，我们就照你的办。”广大革命师生积极地向革委会提出意见和批评，这是他们忠于毛主席，忠于毛泽东思想，忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的具体表现，是他们对革命事业负责的具体表现，也是广大革命师生对新生的革委会的最大信任、最大爱护和最大支持。这不是坏事，而是天大的好事。革委会能不能真正接受群众的监督，能不能正确对待群众的批评和意见，这不是一般的工作作风、工作方法问题，而是站在什么立场、执行什么路线的根本问题，也是建设和巩固革委会的根本问题。毛主席在关于革命委员会的一系列最新指示中，特别强调革委会要密切联系群众，要把革委会建设成“革命化的联系群众的领导班子。”我作为一个解放军的代表，参加革委会的工作，首先就应该认真贯彻毛主席的最新指示，在紧密联系群众，接受群众监督，正确对待群众批评方面做出榜样。
    态度端正了，再仔细想想群众对革委会提出的批评，就感到，我们在落实毛主席的最新指示中，只满足于一般号召，缺乏具体安排和深入细致的工作。这样一检查，越想越感到群众的批评亲切，越想越感到群众的意见正确。
    认识提高了，我就向革委会提出建议，根据群众的意见，专门进行了研究，做出了落实毛主席最新指示的具体计划。同时，对革委会成员如何保持和加强同群众的密切联系，听取群众的意见和批评，也进行了具体研究。以后，在全校革命师生大会上，我就这个问题作了公开的检查，并且表扬了提出批评意见的革命师生，表扬了他们坚决执行和落实毛主席的最新指示，对革委会的工作认真监督、热情支持的革命精神。
    通过这件事，我深深体会到：我们每一个革命委员会的成员，必须遵照毛主席的教导，一时一刻也不脱离群众。群众越是信任、支持，越要谦虚、谨慎，自觉地接受群众的批评和监督，只有这样，才能正确贯彻党的方针政策，才能带领革命群众沿着毛主席的无产阶级革命路线不断前进。
