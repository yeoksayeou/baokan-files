Our great leader Chairman Mao has, amidst the triumphant songs of the Cultural Revolution, issued new instructions to the revolutionary masses and the broad masses of the people across the country: "Universities must be run, and here I mainly refer to institutions of science and engineering. However, the system of school years should be shortened, education must be revolutionized, and proletarian politics must take command. The path of Shanghai Machine Tool Factory, which trains technical personnel from among workers, should be followed. Students should be selected from workers and peasants who have practical experience, sent to schools for a few years of study, and then returned to production practice." Chairman Mao's great call is our battle program for carrying the proletarian educational revolution through to the end, a long-term strategy for opposing revisionism and preventing revisionism, and the fundamental path for training successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause. The issuance of this new instruction is the greatest education, support, encouragement, and spur for us poor and lower-middle peasants. It speaks to the very heart of us poor and lower-middle peasants.

For a long time, Chairman Mao's proletarian educational line and the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line of the Chinese Khrushchev have been in fierce struggle. Chairman Mao teaches the youth to be "completely" and "thoroughly" for the people, while the Chinese Khrushchev does everything possible to instill in the youth the revisionist garbage of seeking official posts and personal gain. Chairman Mao calls on intellectual youth to follow the glorious path of integrating with workers, peasants, and soldiers, while the Chinese Khrushchev lures intellectual youth onto the bourgeois path of detaching from politics, the masses, labor, and practice. Around 1956, during the high tide of agricultural cooperativization nationwide, in order to quickly train a batch of agricultural technicians and build a new socialist countryside, our commune selected a batch of intellectual youth to study at an agricultural university. The broad poor and lower-middle peasants had great hopes for them, hoping that after they returned, they would play a greater role in the countryside. However, the old Beijing Municipal Committee and a handful of capitalist roaders in the commune faithfully executed the revisionist educational line of the Chinese Khrushchev. They told these intellectual youth: "After a few years of study, you can come back and become cadres." They promised official posts to the youth. Some of the youth were originally good, but in school, they were influenced by the revisionist educational line of the Chinese Khrushchev, lost the class character of the laboring people, cultivated bourgeois ideas of seeking personal gain, did not want to return to the countryside to engage in labor, and only wanted to become "officials." Even now, when this matter is mentioned, the broad poor and lower-middle peasants are very indignant. They excitedly say: "The biggest capitalist roader within the party, the Chinese Khrushchev, is the biggest villain. We must thoroughly criticize and expose the revisionist educational line he peddles and resolutely carry out Chairman Mao's proletarian educational line to train the youth into successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause."

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The most intelligent and most talented are the soldiers with the most practical experience." Chairman Mao's words are absolutely true. Successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause are those who grow up in the great storms of class struggle. A few years ago, a batch of university students also came to our place, and some had studied abroad. We asked a university graduate in forestry to help us manage peach trees, and she said: "I specialized in apples, I don't know about peach trees." We then had her go to the apple orchard to prune branches, but she didn't even know how to hold the pruning shears, and her hand was swollen with a big blister. The poor and lower-middle peasants spoke to these university students with heavy hearts: "You are specialized in studying, not in labor." These young people generally had a big attitude and were separated from the poor and lower-middle peasants by a layer. At the same time, we followed Chairman Mao's teachings on combining theory with practice and adopted the method of setting up short-term training classes to cultivate a batch of tractor drivers, production team accountants, and agricultural technicians from among the commune members. Most of them had not even graduated from primary school, but through practical tempering, they not only were very welcome among the poor and lower-middle peasants but also had practical experience and made remarkable achievements in production. A brigade in the southern part of the commune had poor soil, and several types of vegetables could not be grown. Later, we sent a few of our own cultivated technicians there. They humbly learned from the poor and lower-middle peasants, listened to the opinions of the old farmers, conducted scientific experiments, and improved the soil. Now all kinds of vegetables can be grown. Our commune has a female youth who returned to the brigade as an accountant after graduating from middle school. Because she lacked practical experience, she could only issue receipts for pig manure to the commune members. Another brigade's accountant had not graduated from primary school, but through tempering in actual work, his work was outstanding. Not only were the accounts clear, but he also managed the storage of seeds and conducted scientific experiments. The brigade cadres did not think of things he thought of, and the poor and lower-middle peasants called him a "high consultant." Two educational systems produce two kinds of successors. Chairman Mao's proletarian educational line cultivates reliable successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause, while the Chinese Khrushchev's revisionist educational line cultivates spiritual aristocrats of the bourgeoisie.

"The countryside is a vast expanse where one can achieve great things." The broad poor and lower-middle peasants, tempered by the Cultural Revolution, are full of spirit and high in morale, and in building a new socialist countryside, have already shown great creativity. The countryside needs culture, needs technology, and even more needs young people with knowledge. We hope that the broad student youth will resolutely listen to Chairman Mao's words, go to the countryside, go to the border areas, go to the factories and mines, go to the grassroots, and follow the bright path of integrating with workers, peasants, and soldiers, and follow Chairman Mao in revolution to the end! The broad poor and lower-middle peasants listen to Chairman Mao the most and care the most about state affairs. We must educate and help the intellectual youth to thoroughly criticize the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line of the Chinese Khrushchev, break through the bourgeois educational system, and carry the proletarian educational revolution through to the end!

    毛主席说出了我们贫下中农的心里话
    全国农业劳动模范、北京市丰台区黄土岗人民公社革委会主任　殷维臣
    在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的凯歌声中，我们伟大领袖毛主席又向全国的无产阶级革命派和广大群众发出了最新指示：“大学还是要办的，我这里主要说的是理工科大学还要办，但学制要缩短，教育要革命，要无产阶级政治挂帅，走上海机床厂从工人中培养技术人员的道路。要从有实践经验的工人农民中间选拔学生，到学校学几年以后，又回到生产实践中去。”毛主席的伟大号召，是我们将无产阶级教育革命进行到底的战斗纲领，是反修防修的百年大计，是培养无产阶级革命事业接班人的根本道路。这一最新指示的发表，是对我们贫下中农的最大教育、最大支持、最大鼓舞、最大鞭策，它字字句句都说到了我们贫下中农的心坎上。
    长期以来，毛主席的无产阶级教育路线和中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义教育路线一直在进行着激烈的斗争。毛主席教导青年要“完全”“彻底”为人民，而中国赫鲁晓夫却千方百计向青年灌输“升官发财”追求名利的修正主义黑货；毛主席号召知识青年走同工农兵相结合的光辉道路，而中国赫鲁晓夫却引诱知识青年走脱离政治、脱离群众、脱离劳动、脱离实践的资产阶级邪路。一九五六年前后，在全国农业合作化的高潮中，为了很快地培养一批农业技术人员，建设社会主义新农村，我们公社曾选拔了一批知识青年到农业大学去学习，广大贫下中农对他们抱着很大希望，希望他们回来以后，在农村发挥更大的作用。可是，旧北京市委和公社的一小撮走资派，忠实地执行了中国赫鲁晓夫的修正主义教育路线。他们对这些知识青年说：“学习几年以后，回来可以当干部。”向青年封官许愿。有些青年本来很好，在学校里受了中国赫鲁晓夫修正主义教育路线的影响，却丢掉了劳动人民的阶级本色，滋长了追求名利的资产阶级思想，不想回农村参加劳动，一心想当“官”。直到现在，一提到这件事，广大贫下中农十分愤慨，他们激动地说：“党内最大的走资派中国赫鲁晓夫是最大的坏蛋，我们一定要把他贩卖的修正主义教育路线批倒批臭，坚决执行毛主席的无产阶级教育路线，培养青年成为无产阶级革命事业的接班人。”
    毛主席教导我们：“最聪明、最有才能的，是最有实践经验的战士。”毛主席的话，千真万确。无产阶级革命事业的接班人，就是在阶级斗争的大风大浪中成长起来的。前几年，我们那里也来了一批大学生，还有到国外去学习过的。我们请一个林科毕业的大学生帮助我们管理桃树，她说：“我是专门学苹果的，桃树我不懂。”我们又让她到苹果园去剪枝，她连剪刀也不会拿，手上夹了一个大血泡。贫下中农对这些大学生语重心长地说：“你们是专门念书的，不是劳动的。”这些青年，一般都有很大的架子，和贫下中农之间隔了一层。与此同时，我们遵照毛主席关于理论联系实际的教导，采取办短期训练班的办法，从社员中培养了一批拖拉机手、生产队会计、农业技术员。他们绝大部分小学也没有毕业，但是通过实际锻炼，他们不但很受贫下中农欢迎，而且有实践经验，在生产中做出了显著成绩。公社南部有一个大队，土质不好，有几种菜不能种，后来我们调去几个自己培养的技术员，他们虚心向贫下中农学习，听取老农的意见，搞科学实验，改造土壤，现在各种菜都能种了。我们公社有个女青年，中学毕业后回队当会计，由于没有实践经验，她只会给社员开收猪粪的条据。另一个大队的会计，小学未毕业，由于在实际工作中得到了锻炼，工作很出色，不仅账目清楚，还兼管储存种子，作科学实验。大队干部想不到的事他想到了，贫下中农称他是“高参”。两种教育制度培养出两种接班人。毛主席的无产阶级教育路线，培养出来的是无产阶级革命事业的可靠接班人；而中国赫鲁晓夫的修正主义教育路线，培养的是资产阶级的精神贵族。
      “农村是一个广阔的天地，在那里是可以大有作为的。”广大的贫下中农经过无产阶级文化大革命的战斗洗礼，意气风发，斗志昂扬，在建设社会主义新农村中，已经显示出了巨大的创造力。农村需要文化，需要技术，更需要有知识的青年。我们希望广大青年学生坚决听毛主席的话，到农村去，到边疆去，到工矿去，到基层去，走同工农兵相结合的光明大道，跟着毛主席革命到底！广大贫下中农最听毛主席的话，最关心国家大事，我们要教育和帮助知识青年，彻底批判中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义教育路线，打破资产阶级教育制度，把无产阶级教育革命进行到底！
