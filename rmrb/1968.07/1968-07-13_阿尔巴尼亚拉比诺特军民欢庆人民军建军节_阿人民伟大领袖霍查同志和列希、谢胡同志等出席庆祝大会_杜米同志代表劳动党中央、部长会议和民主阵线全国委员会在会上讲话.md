Albanian military and civilians in Rabinot are celebrating the 25th anniversary of the founding of the People's Army. The great leader of the Albanian people, Comrade Enver Hoxha, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Party of Labour of Albania, Chairman of the Presidium of the People's Assembly, Comrade Mehmet Shehu, Chairman of the Council of Ministers, and other party and state leaders attended the celebration.

On the morning of the 10th, more than ten thousand military personnel and civilians in the district of Elbasan held a grand celebration in the village of Rabinot. It was on this day 25 years ago that the General Staff of the Albanian National Liberation Army (the predecessor of the Albanian People's Army) was established here.

Before the celebration began, the people of the Rabinot mountain area, who have a glorious fighting tradition and made significant contributions during the National Liberation War, marched from all directions to the former site of the General Staff of the National Liberation Army, following the footsteps of the guerrilla fighters of that time. They spent the night around bonfires, listening to the stories of the old guerrillas about the heroic struggles of the martyrs and heroes against the Italian and German fascist invaders and domestic reactionaries, eagerly awaiting the opportunity to meet their great leader, Comrade Enver Hoxha.

The celebration was declared open by Melezajdi, the first secretary of the Elbasan District Committee. Subsequently, Comrade Beqir Balluku, a member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Party of Labour of Albania and Chief of the General Staff of the People's Army, delivered a speech on behalf of the Central Committee of the Party of Labour, the Council of Ministers, and the National Committee of the Democratic Front.

The military attaché of the Chinese Embassy in Albania, Li Zhongxuan, was invited to attend the celebration.

After the celebration, Comrade Enver Hoxha cut the ribbon for the National Liberation Army General Staff Museum and visited the museum with the people.

At the luncheon that day, Comrade Enver Hoxha spoke. He, on behalf of the Central Committee of the Party of Labour, extended greetings to the people, troops, old guerrillas, and participants of the National Liberation War in Rabinot and the entire Elbasan district. The old guerrillas, families of martyrs, members of agricultural cooperatives, youth, and women present reported to Comrade Enver Hoxha on their achievements in the revolutionary movement and socialist construction in the mountainous areas. Comrade Enver Hoxha had a cordial conversation with them and gave important instructions on various issues.

On the 10th, military and civilians in districts such as Gjirokastra, Saranda, and Lushnje also held various celebratory activities.

That evening, the capital Tirana and ten other cities, including Gjirokastra and Korça, fired cannons in celebration. In the "Skanderbeg" Square of Tirana, a grand fireworks display was held, and troops and other cultural workers performed excellent cultural programs.
