Recently, we visited Comrade Ren Yongbin, the director of the Revolutionary Committee of Xingtai Foundry in Hebei Province and a member of the Communist Party. When we found him in the workshop, he was covered in dust, his hands black, dressed in worker's clothes, and pouring molten iron to cast pots. This cadre, who hails from a poor peasant family and has grown from a worker, spends his days rolling with the workers. The workshop is his battlefield for labor, his frontline for criticizing and repudiating revisionism, and also his office. When we mention Ren Yongbin, the workers praise him, saying: "Old Ren is just like an ordinary worker. He leads the revolution and promotes production, always staying with us. He is the leader of our ideological revolution and a good Party member who never leaves the masses."

When we asked him to share his experiences in maintaining close ties with the masses, he first read to us a passage from Chairman Mao's teachings: "The outstanding feature of our Party is that it maintains close ties with the masses of the people." Then, he spoke with deep conviction: "Following Chairman Mao's consistent teachings, we must carry forward the Party's fine tradition of maintaining close ties with the masses. This is the fundamental guarantee for us to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and to consolidate and develop the revolutionary committee. We must never forget this." Below are several points from Comrade Ren Yongbin's experiences.

	Heart with the Masses, Roots Growing Deeper

Great Leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "The masses are the real heroes, while we ourselves are often childish and ignorant, not understanding this point, we cannot acquire even the most elementary knowledge." Chairman Mao's great teaching most profoundly and accurately expounds the great truth of believing in the masses and relying on the masses. Through the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, my understanding of Chairman Mao's great teaching has become much deeper. I have come to feel more and more that the masses are the real heroes, and relying on the masses leads to victory, while being separated from the masses means being at a loss. Therefore, after the masses elected me as the director of the revolutionary committee, I made up my mind to follow Chairman Mao's words, believe in the masses, rely on the masses, and never leave them, strictly implementing Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. My heart thinks this way, and my mouth says it too. However, when faced with specific issues, sometimes I slip, thinking only of myself and forgetting the masses.

Soon after the revolutionary committee was established, the stationed military personnel suggested mobilizing the workers to criticize the committee. Everyone thought this was a good idea, and it was announced at the workers' meeting. However, as soon as the meeting ended, I began to worry. I worried that a handful of class enemies might cause trouble under the guise of "criticism," that the masses might be deceived, and that the revolutionary and production order might be disrupted.

The facts turned out to be the opposite of my thoughts. The broad revolutionary masses cherish the newly born revolutionary committee. Their revolutionary vigilance is particularly high, and they keep a close eye on the slightest movements of a handful of class enemies. Whenever class enemies try to find loopholes, they are quickly detected by the masses. The broad revolutionary workers not only affirmed the achievements of the revolutionary committee but also offered sincere criticism and many reasonable suggestions, playing a significant role in consolidating and developing the revolutionary committee.

This incident taught me a profound lesson. I repeatedly pondered why, whenever the issue of mobilizing the masses to criticize arose, I worried that the masses might be deceived by class enemies. Isn't this a lack of faith in the masses? I repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's teachings on the mass line. Chairman Mao said: "The people, only the people, are the motive force in the making of world history." "In a certain sense, the most intelligent, the most capable, are the most experienced fighters." Comparing myself with Chairman Mao's teachings, I deeply realized that Chairman Mao's mass line has not yet deeply rooted in my mind. In a word, my worldview has not been transformed. From then on, I put down my cadre's airs, became a student of the workers, and rolled with them every day, working, studying, and criticizing and repudiating revisionism together. I increasingly felt that the workers are the most loyal to Chairman Mao, and they are everywhere my good examples to learn from. In this way, I have the masses in my eyes and heart, believe in the masses, rely on the masses, respect the masses' pioneering spirit, and feel more and more that I cannot do without the masses. My roots grow deeper in the masses.

	Sweat with the Workers, Hearts Growing Closer

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Cadres should participate in collective productive labor to maintain the broadest, most frequent, and closest ties with the working people. This is a fundamental matter in the socialist system, which helps to overcome bureaucracy, prevent revisionism and dogmatism." After becoming the director of the revolutionary committee, I repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's teachings and deeply realized that whether or not to insist on participating in productive labor is a major issue of loyalty to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Without participating in productive labor, one will lose the character of the working people, become detached from the masses, and turn into a revisionist. Therefore, I set a rule for myself: leave the office and work in the workshop. Wherever the work is dirty and heavy, I go there and become a student of the workers.

The dirtiest and hardest work in our foundry is "carrying fire" for casting. I chose this process as a good battlefield for tempering and transforming myself. I have suffered hardships since I was young, and after liberation, I became a worker and did all kinds of dirty and hard work. However, when I first went to the casting process to participate in labor, the worker comrades, considering my physical strength, suggested I do some auxiliary work. Without saying a word, I picked up a forty-plus pound iron ladle and started working. When I had worked for over two hours, I couldn't take it anymore. My arms ached, my legs were numb, and from head to toe, I was scorched by the 1,300-degree high-temperature iron water. At this moment, a thought flashed in my mind: take a break! As soon as this slacking thought appeared, I immediately realized it was wrong. I came here to temper and transform my thoughts. Just a little fatigue and I want to rest, this won't do! Today, my arms and legs ache, which shows that I participated in productive labor less when I was the deputy director. Thinking of this, I stretched my arms and kicked my legs, and started working again. I worked for about ten days straight, overcoming the fatigue in my waist and legs.

During labor, worker comrades all came to take care of me, but I declined. I felt that the more the worker comrades cared for and took care of me, the more I had to strictly demand of myself. Only in this way could I better temper myself and promote ideological revolutionization. Once, while carrying a full ladle of molten iron for casting, suddenly the iron water splashed out, burning a large area on my foot. The whole team saw me injured and said with concern: "Rest, go find a doctor to look at it, we'll take care of your work." I firmly said: "Comrade Mai Xiande didn't leave the frontline despite his serious injury, what is this minor injury to me! Besides, you can take care of my work, but you can't take care of my ideological revolutionization!" Saying this, I wrapped my foot and continued working with everyone. I told myself: "You must persist, now you are not carrying 1,300-degree molten iron, but a burning red heart loyal to Chairman Mao. You are walking on the bright path of ideological revolutionization and never leaving the masses as guided by Chairman Mao!" Under the inspiration of Mao Zedong Thought, I persisted in participating in productive labor and never stopped.

Due to the persistent and genuine participation in productive labor, and whenever I had free time, I would find workers to talk heart-to-heart, the workers regarded me as their confidant. Whether it was revolutionary or production issues, they actively sought me out to discuss, and I brought the problems and suggestions they reflected to the revolutionary committee for research and resolution. For example, when the revolutionary committee was mobilizing the masses to launch a fierce attack on class enemies, the workers reported to me that some class enemies were inciting conflicts between cadres and the masses, attacking workers of poor and lower-middle peasant origin, framing revolutionary leaders, and corrupting youth, among other evil activities. The revolutionary committee, based on the materials exposed and reported by the workers, mobilized the masses to accurately and forcefully strike a handful of class enemies.

Several months of persistent participation in productive labor made me deeply feel that: when sweat flows with the workers, words can be spoken to the workers, and hearts grow closer to the workers. The workers satisfactorily said: "Old Ren is heart-to-heart with us, truly our confidant."

	The Less Special the Life, the More the Masses Love the Cadres

To never leave the masses, one must resolutely fight against the mentality of becoming an official and a lord, and not be special in life at all. In life, I always strictly demand of myself, aligning with the workers in every aspect, and not overlooking even the smallest flaws in life. Take bathing, for example. Our factory has a bathhouse that opens at 4 PM every day, but I did not strictly follow this rule in the past and sometimes took a shower early if I finished work early. This issue did not attract my attention at first.

Our factory's bathhouse is next to the canteen. One afternoon, I took my child to the canteen to find the steward, and on the way, I met a worker who joked: "Old Ren, not only do you bathe yourself, but you also take your child to bathe in clean water!" Because we often worked together, I also joked: "Have you done your investigation? I'm here to see the steward for business!" After saying this, I walked and thought, why did the worker joke with me like this? This incident alerted me. My thoughts churned: although I was not bathing in clean water today, I had bathed in clean water before. It seems that this worker was joking, but it was actually a criticism. This criticism is good! Chairman Mao teaches us: "Communist Party members must never detach themselves from the masses, never stand above the masses, and become officials and lords, but should appear before the masses as ordinary laborers, immerse themselves in the masses, and blend in with the masses." Comparing myself with Chairman Mao's teachings, I repeatedly examined myself and felt that bathing in clean water seemed like a small matter, but it was actually a big matter of detaching from the masses. I could casually take a shower early, but could the workers? Isn't this special treatment? The workers bathe together, not minding the dirt or crowding, but I mind the dirt and crowding, what kind of class feelings are these! Struggling and working hard, not being special, and maintaining close ties with the masses are our Party's glorious tradition and Chairman Mao's consistent teachings; becoming an official and a lord, seeking comfort and enjoyment, and being special are the style of the Kuomintang officials. The more I thought, the more I felt I had let down Chairman Mao's repeated teachings, and the more I felt I had let down the worker comrades who fought alongside me. From then on, whenever I bathed, I either bathed with the workers or was the last to bathe. Although the water was a bit dirty, it washed my thoughts clean and washed away the special treatment thoughts.

Through this bathing incident, I deeply realized that: for us who have grown from workers, being special in life is forgetting our hardships in the old society and forgetting the character of the working class. From then on, I followed Chairman Mao's teaching of "being both an 'official' and a 'commoner,'" strictly demanding of myself in everything as an ordinary worker, never being special in the slightest. I did this, and the workers saw it in their eyes and remembered it in their hearts. They said: "Old Ren is the director in position, but in ideological style, he is just like an ordinary worker. Such cadres, we workers trust from the bottom of our hearts."

	Insisting on Promoting Proletarian Politics is the Fundamental Way to Connect with the Masses

I deeply feel from practice that connecting with the masses must prominently feature proletarian politics and Mao Zedong Thought. Without this, even if one is with the masses every day, one will still be detached from the masses.

Previously, when I was the deputy director, I always felt that I connected with the masses quite well. The factory is not large, and the number of people is not many. Almost every day, I would go to the workshop to take a look, meet with the worker comrades, and sometimes participate in labor with the workers, chatting and laughing. However, there were still many criticisms of me, saying: "Although in the masses, the heart is in the clouds, always busy with business, technology takes the lead." At that time, hearing these criticisms, I still couldn't accept them. During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, through carrying out revolutionary criticism and repudiation, I raised my awareness. I realized that although I also went to the masses before, I rarely talked about politics with comrades, exchanged hearts, and whenever I spoke, it was about business, production, and technology, becoming more and more soulless. On the surface, it seemed like connecting with the masses, but in reality, it was seriously detached from the masses.

After becoming the director of the revolutionary committee, I paid special attention to this issue, always and everywhere insisting on Mao Zedong Thought taking the lead, consciously going to the worker masses to talk heart-to-heart, exchanging hearts, and jointly studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought. In this way, the broad revolutionary masses were effectively united, the relationship with the masses was tightened, and a handful of class enemies were forcefully struck.

A young worker from a poor peasant family is a capable person in production. During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, due to a lack of class struggle awareness, he was deceived by class enemies and once stood on the wrong side. Because of this, his thoughts were heavy, and his spirits were low. In this situation, following Chairman Mao's teaching of "our cadres must care for every soldier, and all revolutionary troops must care for, love, and help each other," I took the initiative to go to his dormitory in the evening and talked heart-to-heart with him. Together, we studied Chairman Mao's important instructions during his inspections of North China, Central South, and East China, and together we recalled bitterness and sweetness, helping him raise his awareness of class struggle and line struggle. He said painfully: "I have let down Chairman Mao, I have forgotten my roots. From now on, I must study and apply Chairman Mao's works, follow Chairman Mao, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end." After several heart-to-heart talks, this young man changed, and in the struggle against the enemy, he exposed and criticized the factory's walking capitalist roaders' evil plots to sabotage the Cultural Revolution and attempt to restore capitalism. In the class struggle, through caring for and helping each other politically, we two built a deep proletarian friendship. This incident made me even more firmly believe in the need to prominently feature proletarian politics in connecting with the masses.

Under the leadership of Comrade Ren Yongbin, all members of the Revolutionary Committee of Xingtai Foundry strive to achieve ideological revolutionization and maintain close ties with the masses. Except for one person on duty in the office, all other committee members work, study, criticize and repudiate revisionism, and implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions with the workers in the workshops and teams. This has made the entire factory's appearance completely new. Now, the revolutionary committee of this factory has truly become a battle command center that holds high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and maintains close ties with the masses, and a strong fortress that leads the broad revolutionary masses in continuously attacking a handful of class enemies.

    听毛主席的话，一刻也不脱离群众
    ——邢台铸锅厂革委会主任任永斌同志谈紧密联系群众的体会
    最近，我们访问了河北省邢台铸锅厂革命委员会主任、共产党员任永斌同志。我们在工房里找到他的时候，只见他满脸是灰、两手黑，穿着一身工人服装，正在端铁水铸锅。这个出身于贫农家庭，由工人成长起来的干部，成天和工人滚在一起。工房，是他劳动的战场，是他斗私批修的阵地，也是他办公的地方。提起任永斌，工人们就称赞说：“老任和咱普通工人一样，抓革命，促生产，始终和我们在一起。他是咱思想革命化的带头人，是一刻也不脱离群众的好党员。”
    当我们请他谈谈自己联系群众的体会时，他首先给我们读了一段毛主席的教导：“我们共产党人区别于其他任何政党的又一个显著的标志，就是和最广大的人民群众取得最密切的联系。”然后，他深有体会地说：“遵照毛主席的一贯教导，发扬党的紧密联系群众的优良作风，是我们夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利，巩固和发展革命委员会的根本保证，我们切切不可忘记。”下面是任永斌同志谈的几点体会。
      心里有了群众，根子越扎越深
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“群众是真正的英雄，而我们自己则往往是幼稚可笑的，不了解这一点，就不能得到起码的知识。”毛主席这一伟大教导，最精辟、最深刻地阐明了相信群众，依靠群众的伟大真理。经过史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命，我对毛主席这一伟大教导的理解比过去深刻得多了，越来越感到群众是真正的英雄，依靠群众就能胜利，离开群众就寸步难行。所以，群众选我当了革委会主任以后，我就下定决心，听毛主席的话，相信群众，依靠群众，一刻也不脱离群众，不折不扣地执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。心里是这么想的，嘴里是这么说的；可是，一遇到具体事情，有时就好滑扣，心里只有自己，没有了群众。
    革命委员会成立不久，驻厂解放军支左人员就建议发动职工给革委会提意见。大伙觉得这个建议好，就在职工大会上进行了号召。可是，会一散，我就有点担心了。我担心的是，一小撮阶级敌人会不会借“批评”之名兴风作浪，群众会不会上他们的当，搞不好会不会打乱革命和生产的秩序。
    事实恰恰与自己的想法相反。广大革命群众爱护新生的革命委员会。他们的革命警惕性特别高，一小撮阶级敌人的一举一动，群众都看在眼里。阶级敌人想钻空子，很快就被群众觉察了。广大革命职工既肯定了革委会的工作成绩，又提出了诚恳的批评和不少合理建议，对巩固和发展革命委员会起了很大的作用。
    这件事对我教育很深。我反复考虑，为什么一提发动群众提意见，我就担心群众上阶级敌人的当？这不是不相信群众又是什么呢！我反复学习了毛主席关于群众路线的教导。毛主席说：“人民，只有人民，才是创造世界历史的动力。”“在某种意义上来说，最聪明、最有才能的，是最有实践经验的战士。”对照毛主席的教导，我深刻认识到，毛主席的群众路线还没有在自己头脑中深深扎根。一句话，自己的世界观还没有改造好。从此以后，我放下干部架子，当工人的小学生，成天和工人滚在一起，同劳动、同学习，一块儿斗私批修，越来越感到工人对毛主席最忠，他们处处都是自己学习的好榜样。这样一来，自己眼里有了群众，心里记着群众，遇事相信群众，依靠群众，尊重群众首创精神，越来越感到离不开群众，在群众中扎根就越来越深了。
    汗水和工人流在一起，心和工人越贴越紧
    毛主席教导我们：“干部通过参加集体生产劳动，同劳动人民保持最广泛的、经常的、密切的联系。这是社会主义制度下一件带根本性的大事，它有助于克服官僚主义，防止修正主义和教条主义。”我当了革委会主任以后，反复学习毛主席这一教导，深刻认识到：坚持不坚持参加生产劳动，这是对毛主席的无产阶级革命路线忠不忠的大问题。不参加生产劳动，就会丢掉劳动人民的本色，就会脱离群众，就会变修。于是，我给自己订了一个制度：走出办公室，办公在工房，那里活脏活重就在那里干，当工人的小学生。
    我们铸锅厂最脏、最累的活，是“端火”浇铸，我就选这个工序，作为锻炼改造自己的好战场。我从小受过苦，解放后当了工人，什么脏活、累活都干过。但是，我刚去浇铸工序参加劳动的时候，工人同志照顾我的体力，劝我做些辅助活，我二话没说，端起四十多斤重的铁水勺就干起来了。当我干了两个多小时，就受不了啦，两只胳膊又酸又疼，腿也抬不动了，从头到脚被一千三百多度高温的铁水烤得火辣辣的疼。这时，思想上闪出一个念头：歇歇吧！这种松劲思想刚一露头，我立刻意识到不对。我是来锻炼改造思想的，刚累一点就想歇，这不行！今天胳膊腿酸疼，正说明我过去当副厂长时参加生产劳动少。想到这里，我狠狠地伸了伸胳膊，踢踢腿，又干了起来。一直干了十来天，闯过了腰酸腿疼这一关。
    在劳动中，工人同志都来照顾我，我都谢绝了。我觉得，工人同志越是关怀、照顾，我越要严格要求自己。只有这样，才能更好地锻炼自己，促进思想革命化。有一次，我端着满满一大勺铁水浇铸，突然铁水溅出来，把脚面烫伤一大块。全组同志看我受了伤，关心地说：“你休息吧，快去找医生看看，你的活我们包了。”我坚定地说：“麦贤得同志重伤不下火线，我这点轻伤算什么！再说，我的活你们包了，我的思想革命化你们可包不了啊！”说着，我把脚包了包，又和大伙干了起来。我对自己说：“你要坚持下去，现在你端的不是一千三百度的铁水，而是一颗忠于毛主席的炽热的红心，你走的是毛主席指引的一条思想革命化、一刻也不脱离群众的光明大道啊！”在毛泽东思想的鼓舞下，我坚持参加生产劳动，一直没有停。
    由于经常地、实打实地坚持参加生产劳动，并且一有空我就找工人谈心，工人们就把我当作他们的知心人，无论是革命、生产中的问题，都主动地找我谈，我就把他们反映的问题和建议带到革委会研究解决。比如，正当革委会发动群众向阶级敌人展开猛烈进攻的时候，工人们向我反映了有的阶级敌人挑拨干群关系，打击贫下中农出身的工人，陷害革命领导干部，拉拢腐蚀青年等许多罪恶活动。革委会根据工人反映和揭发的材料，深入发动群众，稳、准、狠地打击了一小撮阶级敌人。
    几个月来坚持参加生产劳动的实践，使我深深体会到：汗水和工人流在一起，话就能和工人说到一处，心就和工人越贴越紧。工人们满意地说：老任和咱们心贴心，真是咱们的知心人。
      生活越不特殊，群众越爱干部
    要一刻也不脱离群众，就要狠斗做官当老爷的思想作风，生活上一点也不特殊化。我在生活上时刻严格要求自己，处处向工人看齐，那怕一点点生活上的小毛病，也不放过。就拿洗澡这件事来说吧，我们厂里有个澡堂子，规定每天下午四点开门，可是过去我遵守这个制度就不严格，有时下班早了，就提前去洗个清水澡。这个问题，开始并没有引起我的注意。
    我们厂的澡堂子和食堂紧挨着。有一天下午，我领着孩子到食堂去找司务长，在路上碰见一个工人，他开玩笑地说：“老任，你自个洗还不算，还领着孩子去洗清水澡哇！”因为我们经常在一起熟了，我也开玩笑地说：“你调查研究了没有？我是去找司务长办事的啊！”话说完了，我一边走一边想，为什么工人同我开这样的玩笑？这件事引起了我的警觉。我思想上翻腾开了：虽说我今天不是去洗清水澡，可是我过去洗过。看来这个工人是开玩笑，实际上是个意见。这个意见提得好！毛主席教导我们：“共产党员绝不可脱离群众，绝不可高踞于群众之上，做官当老爷，而应当以普通劳动者的姿态，出现在群众面前，深入于群众之中，同群众打成一片。”我对照毛主席的教导，反复检查自己，觉得洗清水澡表面上看来是小事，实际上是脱离群众的大事。自己能随随便便提前去洗澡，工人能这样吗？这不是特殊是什么！工人们在一块洗，不嫌脏、不嫌挤，自己就嫌脏嫌挤，这是什么阶级感情啊！艰苦奋斗，不特殊化，紧密联系群众，是我们党的光荣传统，是毛主席的一贯教导；做官当老爷，图安逸贪享受，搞特殊化，是国民党官老爷的作风。我越想越觉得对不起毛主席的谆谆教导，越想越觉得对不起和自己一起战斗的工人兄弟。从此以后，每当我洗澡时，不是和工人一块洗，就是最后洗，特别是在最后洗，虽然水有些脏，但把我的思想洗得很干净，把特殊化的思想洗掉了。
    通过洗澡这件事，我深深认识到：象我们这些由工人成长起来的干部，闹生活特殊化，就是忘记了自己在旧社会的苦难，忘记了工人阶级的本色。从那以后，我遵照毛主席“既当‘官’，又当老百姓”的教导，事事以普通工人严格要求自己，从不搞半点特殊。我这样做了，工人看在眼里，记在心上。他们说：
  “老任在职务上是主任，在思想作风上和咱普通工人一样。象这样的干部，咱工人打心眼里信得过。”
    坚持突出无产阶级政治是联系群众的根本
    我从实践中深深体会到，联系群众一定要突出无产阶级政治，突出毛泽东思想。不这样，即使成天和群众在一块，也会脱离群众。
    以前，在我当副厂长的时候，总觉得自己联系群众还不错，厂子不大，人数也不算多，差不多每天都要到工房转一转，和工人同志们见见面，有时还同工人一起参加劳动，有说有笑。可是，大家对我还有一大堆意见，批评我：“人在群众中，心在九霄外，整天忙业务，技术来挂帅。”当时听到这些意见，还有点接受不了。在无产阶级文化大革命中，通过开展革命大批判，我才提高了认识。我认识到，过去虽然也到群众中去了，但是很少和同志们谈谈政治，交交心，一讲就是业务、生产、技术，越讲越没有“灵魂”。表面上看是联系群众，实际上是严重脱离了群众。
    我当了革委会主任以后，就特别注意了这个问题，时时、处处坚持用毛泽东思想挂帅，自觉地到工人群众中去谈心、交心，共同活学活用毛泽东思想。这样一来，有效地团结了广大革命群众，密切了和群众的关系，有力地打击了一小撮阶级敌人。
    一个贫农家庭出身的青年工人，在生产上是一员干将。在无产阶级文化大革命中，他由于缺乏阶级斗争的观念，受了阶级敌人的蒙蔽，曾一度站错了队。因为这，他思想沉闷，情绪不高。在这种情况下，我遵照毛主席“我们的干部要关心每一个战士，一切革命队伍的人都要互相关心，互相爱护，互相帮助”的教导，利用晚上的工余时间，主动到他宿舍里和他谈心，同他一起学习了毛主席视察华北、中南和华东地区时作的重要指示，一起忆苦思甜，帮助他提高了阶级斗争和路线斗争的觉悟。他沉痛地说：“我对不起毛主席，我忘了本。今后，我一定要活学活用毛主席著作，紧跟毛主席，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。”经过几次谈心，这个青年转变了，在对敌斗争中揭发和批判了厂内走资派破坏文化大革命，妄图复辟资本主义的罪恶阴谋。在阶级斗争中，通过从政治上互相关心、互相帮助，我们两人建立了深厚的无产阶级感情。这件事，使我更加坚定了联系群众一定要突出无产阶级政治的信心。
                              ×　×　×
    在任永斌同志的带动下，邢台铸锅厂革委会的成员都努力实现思想革命化，紧紧和群众联系在一起。全体委员除留一个人在办公室值班以外，其他的人都在车间、班组和工人一起劳动、学习，一起斗私批修，一起落实毛主席的最新指示，使全厂面貌焕然一新。现在，这个厂的革委会真正成了高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗、紧密联系群众的战斗指挥部，真正成了率领广大革命群众向一小撮阶级敌人不断进攻的坚强战斗堡垒。　新华社通讯员
