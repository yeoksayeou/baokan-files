The revolutionary modern Beijing opera model play *The Red Lantern*, is a play that praises the proletarian heroes armed with Mao Zedong Thought. It is a vivid teaching material for us to carry out revolutionary tradition education. Such a play, we revolutionary soldiers love to watch more and more.

Soldiers love to watch *The Red Lantern* because it successfully portrays the towering images of three generations of proletarian revolutionary heroes in the Li Yuhe family. Their thorough revolutionary spirit and heroic deeds of daring to struggle and being good at struggling shine with the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought everywhere. Especially the image of Li Yuhe, it educates us deeply. In front of the brutal enemy, Li Yuhe, with an overwhelmingly heroic demeanor, "Rather have my bones broken, I will never yield!" At the moment of life and death on the way to the execution ground, he remains calm and composed. In the last moment of his life, he is full of revolutionary optimism, firmly believing that the Japanese invaders will perish and the new China will shine like the morning sun. Li Yuhe's contempt for the enemy, overwhelming the enemy, and treating death with indifference, sets a brilliant example of being loyal to the people, loyal to the Party, and loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

The Chinese Khrushchev, this traitor who betrays the revolution, is cowardly and surrenders to the enemy. In order to save his life, he crawled out from the doghole and shamelessly said that this was to preserve the revolutionary forces. Pfft! This is the logic of a coward, a thorough traitor's philosophy! *The Red Lantern* is a heavy artillery shell that thoroughly smashes the "traitor philosophy" and "survival philosophy" propagated by the Chinese Khrushchev. Every word and action of Li Yuhe is a spear and dagger aimed at the heart of the Chinese Khrushchev. *The Red Lantern* greatly boosts the morale of the proletarian revolutionary faction and expresses the boundless enthusiasm and aspirations of revolutionary soldiers to be infinitely loyal to the people, the Party, and Chairman Mao. Every time we watch *The Red Lantern*, we receive a profound education; every time we listen to the broadcast of *The Red Lantern*, we receive a great inspiration. Each time we watch it, we recall the heroic struggles of our revolutionary predecessors, and we understand more deeply how hard-won the proletarian dictatorship is. We must firmly grasp the rifle, vowing to defend the proletarian dictatorship with our lives and blood. Each time we listen, we think of our compatriots suffering in Taiwan, and of our class brothers oppressed around the world. We are determined to follow in the footsteps of the martyrs, shoulder the burden of the world revolution, and be ready at any time to sacrifice everything to thoroughly bury imperialism, revisionism, and all reactionaries.

*The Red Lantern* is a red light in the revolution of Chinese opera. It appeared and immediately shook the whole of China, and shocked the world. Revolutionary soldiers see the "red light," love the "red light," and resolutely defend the "red light" with their lives. We vow to let the revolutionary "red light" shine forever, illuminating the whole world!

    誓让革命红灯照全
    球中国人民解放军某部  刘成华
    革命现代京剧样板戏《红灯记》，是一出歌颂用毛泽东思想武装起来的无产阶级英雄的好戏，是我们进行革命传统教育的生动教材。这样的戏，我们革命战士越看越爱看。
    战士爱看《红灯记》，因为它成功地塑造了李玉和一家三代人高大的无产阶级革命英雄的形象。他们的彻底革命精神和敢于斗争、善于斗争的英雄事迹，处处闪耀着毛泽东思想的光辉。尤其是李玉和这个光辉的形象，使我们受到很深的教育。在残暴的敌人面前，李玉和以压倒一切敌人的英雄气概，“宁可筋骨碎，决不把头回！”在走向刑场的生死关头，面不改色，心不跳。在生命的最后一刻，他满怀革命的乐观主义精神，坚信日寇就要灭亡，新中国将似朝阳光照人间。李玉和藐视敌人，压倒敌人，视死如归的英雄气概，为我们树立了一个忠于人民，忠于党，忠于毛主席的革命路线的光辉榜样。
    中国赫鲁晓夫这个出卖革命的大叛徒，在敌人面前贪生怕死，屈膝投降。他为了活命，从狗洞里爬了出来，还恬不知耻地说什么这是为了保存革命的力量。呸！真是怕死鬼的逻辑，彻头彻尾的叛徒哲学！《红灯记》就是彻底摧垮中国赫鲁晓夫所宣扬的“叛徒哲学”“活命哲学”的一发重型炮弹。李玉和的每句话，每个行动都是刺向中国赫鲁晓夫心窝的投枪和匕首。《红灯记》大长了无产阶级革命派的志气，大抒了革命战士无限忠于人民，无限忠于党，无限忠于毛主席的豪情壮志。我们看一次《红灯记》，就受一次深刻的教育；听一次《红灯记》的广播，就受一次巨大的鼓舞。每看一次，都使我们想起革命前辈的英勇斗争，更加懂得无产阶级政权来之不易。我们必须紧握枪杆子，誓用生命和鲜血保卫无产阶级政权。每听一次，都使我们想起台湾受苦难的同胞，想起世界上被压迫的阶级兄弟。我们坚决要踏着先烈的血迹，挑起世界革命的重担，随时准备为彻底埋葬帝国主义、修正主义和一切反动派献出自己的一切。
    《红灯记》是我国京剧革命的一盏红灯。它一出现就轰动了全中国，震惊了全世界。革命战士看“红灯”，爱“红灯”，坚决用自己的生命保卫“红灯”。誓让革命的“红灯”永放光芒，普照全世界！
