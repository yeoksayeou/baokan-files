Implementing streamlining and efficiency is a sharp and profound class struggle. The new revolutionary institutions are in sharp contradiction with the old ideas and practices of the exploiting classes. The Revolutionary Committee of Lingbao County bravely broke free from the old institutional framework and made significant strides along the path of "streamlining and efficiency," beginning to establish a brand-new revolutionary work style. This is a revolution. As Chairman Mao pointed out: "A new social system must be established on the basis of the old system. The remnants of old ideas that reflect the old system will persist in people's minds for a long time and will not easily retreat."

A Deep Lesson

The Revolutionary Committee of Lingbao County went through a tortuous process in implementing streamlining and efficiency. As early as when the committee was first established, they began to reform the bloated and cumbersome old institutions. The original county government's twenty-plus departments were merged into eight groups, and nearly two hundred staff members were reduced to eighty.

However, that reform did not break through the old, overlapping institutions. Although some departments were merged and some staff were reduced, people's old ideas and habits did not change. The work style remained the same: you handle politics, I handle production, multiple systems, multiple teams, each doing their own thing, many levels, many meetings, much red tape. After just twenty days, some groups secretly added staff and expanded their organizations. People worried, "Work hasn't even started, and they're already adding staff. When the work expands, will they bring back the old county committee and the old people's committee?"

Is it to break free from the old institutional framework and make a revolution, or to circle around the old institutions and make reforms? This is a key issue in whether streamlining and efficiency can be done well. If, in the process of implementing streamlining and efficiency, one keeps circling around the old institutions, unable to let go, the revolution will not happen. Lingbao County's experience with streamlining and efficiency lies here. Therefore, the masses sharply criticized, "The name changed, the sign changed, but the essence did not change." The most fundamental thing is to connect with the masses.

How to Truly Break Free from the Old Institutional Framework?

What is the standard for streamlining and efficiency? Some comrades who came to Lingbao County to learn all asked this question. They inquired in detail: How many groups does the county Revolutionary Committee have? How many people are in each group? How do the staff work...

The comrades from Lingbao County told us: In the past, when they went to other places to learn from the experience of streamlining and efficiency, they were also very interested in these questions, always thinking that these were the standards for streamlining and efficiency. Now it seems that these specific issues are only of some reference value for streamlining and efficiency; they are not the standard.

What is the standard for streamlining and efficiency? Chairman Mao said: "The most fundamental aspect of reforming state organs is to connect with the masses." "In this round of streamlining and efficiency, we must achieve the five goals of streamlining, unification, efficiency, economy, and opposing bureaucratism." This is the standard for our implementation of streamlining and efficiency.

The comrades from Lingbao County believe that whether to connect with the masses or to detach from the masses is the dividing line between revolutionary new institutions and old institutions. Revolutionary new institutions follow a line of "relying on" the masses. "Relying on" the masses means that the leading organs must implement streamlining and efficiency, so that the leadership at all levels can better immerse themselves in the masses, become one with the masses, follow the mass line, and mobilize the masses to handle everything, rather than having a few people take over and act on behalf of the masses. Old institutions follow a line of "managing" the masses. Therefore, they necessarily engage in trivial philosophy, set up a bloated and cumbersome bureaucratic administrative system, stand above the masses, detach from the masses, and act like officials and lords.

The comrades from Lingbao County, following the fundamental principle of "connecting with the masses" and the five goals pointed out by Chairman Mao, bravely broke free from the old institutional framework to think about problems. In the process of practice, they also encountered an issue of "matching up." Should administrative departments have what the Party committee has? Should lower-level organs have what higher-level organs have?... To whom should the organizational setup of the newly established Revolutionary Committee "match up"? The comrades from Lingbao County first considered the needs of the masses and the grassroots. They believed that socialist power is to serve the socialist economic base and represent the fundamental interests of the proletariat and the broad masses of the people. Only by facing the masses and the grassroots and "matching up" can one represent the fundamental interests of the masses and promote the development of socialist productive forces, making the superstructure adapt to the needs of the socialist economic base. Therefore, they changed the "eight groups and two offices" into four groups: political work, promoting revolution and production, security, and general affairs.

The result of Lingbao County Revolutionary Committee's actions received enthusiastic support and approval from the broad revolutionary masses. The poor and lower-middle peasants there told us many vivid examples.

Before the Cultural Revolution, an old peasant went to the original county committee to expose a serious incident of a rich farmer occupying collective farmland. However, the reception room of the original county committee passed him to the reception room of the original county people's committee, which then passed him to the reception room of the original county court. After being passed around like this for ten days, the problem was still not solved. The old peasant then reported to a cadre of the county people's committee. That cadre irresponsibly pushed him off, saying, "Go to the commune and report it again!" The old peasant was very angry. Recently, this old peasant came to the reception room of the county Revolutionary Committee. After discussing the problem, he asked the receptionist, "Do I need to go to other reception rooms?" The receptionist smiled and said to the old peasant, "The Revolutionary Committee has implemented streamlining and efficiency, and there is only one reception room. We can handle it here." The old peasant nodded repeatedly, saying, "Hey! I still remember the old ways!" Then he stood in front of Chairman Mao's portrait and respectfully saluted the great leader Mao, saying excitedly, "Chairman Mao, you are truly heart-to-heart with us poor and lower-middle peasants. Streamlining and efficiency is so good!"

A Battle to Break Down "Selfishness"

Implementing streamlining and efficiency is a great ideological revolution to criticize and repudiate selfishness and establish public-mindedness.

After Lingbao County started the work of streamlining and efficiency, most cadres and staff enthusiastically supported it and resolutely expressed their willingness to follow the party's arrangement, eager to go to the production front line. However, some comrades had some active thoughts:

Some comrades who had stood on the wrong side during the Cultural Revolution thought, "Since I can't participate in the work of the Revolutionary Committee, I'll just wait to be sent down."

Some comrades who were about to participate in the work of the Revolutionary Committee were afraid of "few people, heavy responsibilities, not being able to bear criticism, and not being appreciated for hard work."

Others even said, "It's not good to stay, and it's not good to go down."...

Facts tell us: The setting up of the bloated and cumbersome old institutions is linked to the "selfishness" in people's minds. The "read books to become officials" and "join the party to become officials" theories spread by Liu Shaoqi, as well as various exploitative class ideas left over from the old society, such as despising labor and looking down on the laboring masses, are precisely the ideological basis for Liu Shaoqi to set up the cumbersome old institutions. To break free from the old institutional framework, one must fight against the "selfishness" in people's minds.

This is a battle to break down "selfishness," and the focus of the struggle is whether to be an official and lord or a servant of the people.

The responsible comrades of Lingbao County Revolutionary Committee, following the great leader Chairman Mao's teaching that "grasping ideological education is the central link in uniting the whole party to wage a great political struggle," went deep into the masses, actively guided the masses, and severely criticized Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist line in the construction of political power. They summarized the "five harms" of the bloated and cumbersome old institutions and the "five goods" of streamlining and efficiency. At the same time, they held various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, guiding everyone to use Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, link up the active thoughts in streamlining and efficiency, and deeply touch their souls, making everyone jump out of the circle of the bourgeois "selfishness" of "can go up but can't go down," "can be an official but can't be a citizen."

One comrade mistakenly thought that those who were streamlined down had serious problems. When the Revolutionary Committee notified him to participate in the Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team to go to the countryside, he vaguely agreed but delayed going. After the Revolutionary Committee members learned of his thoughts, they explained to him the significance of streamlining and efficiency, the idea that cadres should be able to go up and down, and "both be an 'official' and a citizen." They used Mao Zedong Thought to cure this comrade's ideological illness, making him happily go to the countryside front line and take on the glorious task of propagating Mao Zedong Thought.

Another comrade, who had broken free from the suppression of the bourgeois reactionary line in the early days of the Cultural Revolution, thought, "Now that we have won, it's time to be a cadre and hold power." However, he happened to encounter streamlining and efficiency and was temporarily unable to understand. The Revolutionary Committee members used Chairman Mao's teaching that "we communists are not here to be officials, but to make revolution" to enlighten and educate him, making him also happily follow the party's arrangement.

The comrades from Lingbao County told us: If we do not carry out the struggle to criticize and repudiate selfishness, do not touch people's souls, and do not promote the revolutionization of people's thinking, the resistance to implementing streamlining and efficiency will be great. Only by thoroughly criticizing and repudiating bourgeois "selfishness" and establishing proletarian "public-mindedness" can the work of streamlining and efficiency be smoothly carried out. The Key Lies in Changing the Work Style

After the institutions were streamlined, how to deal with the situation of fewer people and more work? This is a question that everyone is concerned about.

Before the Cultural Revolution, Lingbao County had also carried out streamlining many times, but after a while, the number of people gradually increased, and the institutions became more and more bloated. Why? One important reason is that people's work style did not change, and the problem could not be fundamentally solved.

After this round of streamlining and efficiency by the Lingbao County Revolutionary Committee, they specifically focused on the revolutionization of the work style of the Revolutionary Committee members. The responsible comrades of the county Revolutionary Committee often told their comrades, "After implementing streamlining and efficiency, how do we deal with fewer people and more work? First, we grasp the root of everything with the great thought of Mao Zedong; second, we believe in the masses, rely on the masses, immerse ourselves in the masses, and follow the mass line, solving a large number of problems at the grassroots level." They led by example, being both "officials" and "citizens." They often went deep into the countryside, to the places with the greatest difficulties, the most complex situations, and the hardest work. They mobilized the masses, relied on the masses, and solved the problems well.

In Lingbao, we heard many such stories:

In Su Village Commune, the two factions had been unable to unite for a long time and often went to the county for assistance to solve the problem. The county comrades, due to not understanding the situation, only judged right and wrong based on reports, and could only play the role of a mediator, resulting in the masses coming to the county nearly twenty times and dragging on for half a year, with the problem still not solved. On January 3, the county Revolutionary Committee was established and implemented streamlining and efficiency. A standing committee member, carrying Chairman Mao's latest instructions, went there. After an investigation, they found the key to the problem and, together with everyone, studied, criticized selfishness, and repudiated revisionism. The two factions quickly united and established the Revolutionary Committee. The facts proved that when the work style changed, the leadership was not just solving problems based on reports, but went out of the office and into the masses, making the problems easier to solve.

Recently, Lingbao County opened a study class of Mao Zedong Thought for more than 150 cadres. According to the old methods, just organizing this study class would require five or six people. However, this time only two people were needed. Under these circumstances, the comrades responsible for organizing the study class followed Chairman Mao's teachings, changed the old practice of "I give a report and you discuss, you have a problem and I correct it," and mobilized the masses, relying on the masses, letting the masses set the study plan, inviting the masses to be tutors, and together completing the study task smoothly. The facts proved that when the work style changed, the leadership was not just relying on a few people to take over and act on behalf of the masses, but mobilized the masses, relying on the masses, making the problems easier to solve.

Streamlining and efficiency is not just about having fewer "soldiers," but more importantly, the "soldiers" have a revolutionary work style. Once the thought revolutionization is grasped, the organizational revolutionization is guaranteed. A standing committee member of Lingbao County Revolutionary Committee said, "One of the purposes of our streamlining and efficiency is to better mobilize the broad revolutionary masses to care about and manage state affairs. As long as we firmly rely on the masses and fully mobilize the masses, things will be done better." The reality of Lingbao County today fully proves this point.

"Must Be Vigilant Against Backsliding!"

When talking about daring to break free from the old institutional framework, a standing committee member of Lingbao County Revolutionary Committee meaningfully said to us, "Backsliding is the easiest."

Indeed, backsliding is easier than taking a new path.

From the situation in Lingbao County after implementing streamlining and efficiency for more than a month, the new revolutionary institutions are in sharp contradiction with the old ideas and bad work styles. The habits of bureaucratism and the old forces are constantly interfering with and impacting this revolutionary new institution from all sides.

There have been such incidents: As soon as the streamlining and efficiency plan was drawn up, when it came to assigning personnel to each group, a standing committee member argued with other comrades, red-faced and neck-red, just to get a few more staff members for the group he was responsible for.

There have also been such incidents: As soon as the work began, a standing committee member fell back into the old habit of one person deciding everything, not going to the masses to investigate, not understanding the situation, and issuing orders and commands there...

The old forces stubbornly showed themselves. Like a dead rat, it rotted and stank in our midst, surrounding our young and vigorous revolutionary institution with all kinds of decaying and dead things.

Chairman Mao taught us: "The present situation and habits often bind people's minds tightly, and even revolutionaries sometimes cannot escape this."

The revolutionary cadres of Lingbao County, especially those of worker-peasant origin, have the deepest understanding of this. They recalled that when they first entered the office from the grassroots, they initially found the bureaucratic habits and old forces uncomfortable, even resisting them, but over time, they no longer insisted on struggling, gradually becoming accustomed to them. Now, suddenly changing again, they found it uncomfortable, even unpleasant. They said: As long as you relax your vigilance, go with the flow, and let it control you, you will gradually lose your ambition, lose your revolutionary spirit, and eventually become a seedling of revisionism.

"Must be vigilant against backsliding!" The comrades of Lingbao County Revolutionary Committee made this decision. After implementing streamlining and efficiency, they have always been at the forefront of fiercely fighting against the old forces.

The Revolutionary Committee's group for promoting revolution and production has only eight people, responsible for work in agriculture, forestry, water conservancy, industry and commerce, finance, and trade. As soon as the summer grain procurement work began this year, some comrades unconsciously brought out the old ways, burying themselves in business piles, focusing on trivial matters, and spending the whole day on the phone. The county Revolutionary Committee promptly noticed this bad trend, immediately organized everyone to repeatedly study Chairman Mao's teachings on "political work is the lifeline of all economic work," criticized the serious detachment from the masses and proletarian politics of the old county committee and the old county people's committee production office, making everyone quickly leave the office, leave the phone, go to the masses, grasp the root, and take the road of emphasizing proletarian politics. After going to the grassroots, these comrades quickly discovered that the study and application of Chairman Mao's works were well done in Dazichang Brigade of Xiyan Commune, and the class struggle was well grasped, with the summer grain procurement progress being particularly fast. They then held an on-site meeting in this brigade to promote their experience, quickly launching a wave of promoting revolution and production across the county, and completing the summer grain procurement task quickly and well.

Currently, under the guidance of the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, the Revolutionary Committee of Lingbao County is further criticizing Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist line in the construction of political power, criticizing conservatism, breaking through the resistance of the old exploitative class forces, and striding forward to "organize a revolutionary and mass-connected leadership team" and achieve "streamlining, unification, efficiency, economy, and opposing bureaucratism."

    要勇敢地跳出原来旧机构的圈子
    ——河南省灵宝县革委会实行精兵简政前后
    实行精兵简政是一场尖锐的、深刻的阶级斗争。新的革命机构，同剥削阶级的旧观念、旧作风存在着尖锐的矛盾。灵宝县革委会勇敢地跳出原来旧机构的圈子，沿着“精兵简政”的道路前进了一大步，开始树立了崭新的革命作风。这是一个革命。正如毛主席所指出的：“一个崭新的社会制度要从旧制度的基地上建立起来，它就必须清除这个基地。反映旧制度的旧思想的残余，总是长期地留在人们的头脑里，不愿意轻易地退走的。”一个深刻的教训
    灵宝县革委会实行精兵简政，走过一段曲折的道路。早在革委会刚成立时，他们就开始对臃肿、庞杂的旧机构进行了一番改革。原县机关二十几个部门，合并成了八个组，近两百多工作人员也减少到了八十个人。
    但是，那次改革对旧的重叠的机构并没有打破，虽然合并了一些部门，精简了一些工作人员，但人的旧观念、旧习惯没有变。工作作风还是老一套：你抓你的政治，我抓我的生产，几个系统，数套人马，各搞各的，层次多，会议多，扯皮多。搞了才二十几天，有的组就暗地里加人加编制了。人们担心地说：“工作还没有铺开就加人加编制，等将来工作铺开了，是否还要拿出旧县委、旧人委原套班底啊！”
    是跳出原来旧机构的圈子闹革命，还是绕着原来旧机构的圈子搞改良？这是能不能搞好精兵简政的一个关键问题。在实行精兵简政中，如果绕着旧机构的圈子转来转去，难分难舍，藕断丝连，是不会发生革命的变化的。灵宝县那次精兵简政的教训也就在这里。所以群众尖锐地批评说：“名称改了，牌子换了，实质没有变。”最根本的一条就是联系群众
    怎样才算跳出原来旧机构的圈子？
    精兵简政的标准是什么？
    一些来灵宝县学习的同志都不约而同地提出了这个问题。他们详细地询问：县革委会分几个组；每个组有多少人；工作人员是怎样工作的……
    灵宝县的同志告诉我们：过去他们到外地学习精兵简政的经验时，也是对这些问题特别感兴趣，总以为这些就是精兵简政的标准。现在看来，这些具体问题只是对精兵简政有一定的参考作用，它不是精兵简政的标准。
    究竟什么是精兵简政的标准呢？毛主席说：“国家机关的改革，最根本的一条，就是联系群众。”“在这次精兵简政中，必须达到精简、统一、效能、节约和反对官僚主义五项目的。”这，才是我们实行精兵简政的标准。
    灵宝县革委会的同志认为，是联系群众还是脱离群众，这就是革命的新机构和旧机构的分水岭。革命的新机构执行的是一条“靠”群众的路线。“靠”群众，领导机构就要实行精兵简政，使各级领导更好地深入群众，和群众打成一片，走群众路线，凡事发动群众来办理，而不是少数人包办代替。旧机构执行的是一条“管”群众的路线。为此，他们就必然搞烦琐哲学，弄起一套臃肿、庞杂的官僚主义行政机构，凌驾于群众之上，脱离群众，当官做老爷。
    灵宝县革委会同志依照“联系群众”的根本的一条，以及毛主席指出的五项目的，勇敢地跳出原来旧机构的圈子想问题。他们在实践过程中，也遇到了一个“对口”的问题，什么党委机关有的，行政部门要不要有；上级机关有的，下级机关要不要有……。新生的革命委员会的机构设置到底向谁“对口”？灵宝县革委会的同志，首先考虑的是群众的需要，基层的需要。他们认为，社会主义的政权，是为社会主义经济基础服务的，是代表无产阶级和广大人民群众的根本利益的，只有面向群众，面向基层“对口”，才能代表群众的根本利益，才能推动社会主义生产力的发展，使得上层建筑适应社会主义经济基础的需要。于是，他们就把“八组二室”改成了政治工作、抓革命促生产、保卫、办事等四个组。
    灵宝县革委会这样做的结果，受到了广大革命群众的热烈拥护和支持。那里的贫下中农向我们讲了许多生动例子。
    有一位贫农老大爷在无产阶级文化大革命前，到原县委揭发富农分子占用集体耕地这样一个严重事件。可是，原县委接待室却推到原县人委接待室，原县人委接待室又推到原县法院接待室。这样推来推去，结果十几天也没有解决问题。老大爷又向县人委一位干部反映。那位干部不负责任地推托说：“你到公社再反映一下吧！”老大爷十分生气。最近，这位老大爷来到县革委会接待室，谈了问题之后问接待员：“还要到别的接待室去吗？”接待员笑着对老大爷说：“革委会实行精兵简政了，只有一个接待室，我们这里就可以办理。”老大爷频频点头说：“嘿！我还老记着过去那一套哩！”接着他站在毛主席像前，向伟大领袖毛主席恭恭敬敬地敬了一个礼，激动地说：“毛主席呀，您老人家真是和俺们贫下中农心连心，精兵简政多好啊！”一场破“私”的攻坚战
    实行精兵简政，是一场斗私批修、破私立公的思想大革命。
    灵宝县精兵简政的工作开始以后，大多数干部和工作人员热烈拥护，坚决表示服从党的分配，纷纷要求到生产第一线去。但是，也有少数同志出现了一些活思想：
    一些在无产阶级文化大革命中站错过队的同志，认为“反正咱参加不了革委会工作，等着下放吧！”
    一些即将参加革委会工作的同志，害怕“人少担子重，担不起挨批评，出力不讨好。”
    另外一些人甚至说：“留下不好干，下去不好看。”……
    事实告诉我们：庞大臃肿的旧机构的设置，是跟人们头脑中的资产阶级的“私”字相联系的。中国赫鲁晓夫散布的“读书做官”论、“入党做官”论等修正主义黑货，旧社会遗留下来的鄙视劳动、轻视劳动群众等形形色色的剥削阶级思想，正是中国赫鲁晓夫设置庞杂的旧机构的思想基础。要跳出原来旧机构的圈子，就必须同人们头脑里的资产阶级的“私”字作斗争。
    这是一场破“私”的攻坚战，斗争的焦点是当官做老爷，还是做人民的勤务员。
    灵宝县革委会的负责同志，遵循伟大领袖毛主席关于“掌握思想教育，是团结全党进行伟大政治斗争的中心环节”的教导，深入到群众中去，积极引导群众，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫在政权建设方面所推行的反革命修正主义路线，总结出庞杂臃肿的旧机构的“五害”和精兵简政的“五好”。同时，举办各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，引导大家以毛泽东思想为武器，联系精兵简政中的活思想，狠触自己的灵魂，使大家从
  “能上不能下”、“能官不能民”等资产阶级“私”字的圈子里跳出来。
    有个同志错误地认为，精简下去的人都是有严重问题的。当革委会通知他参加毛泽东思想宣传队下乡时，他含糊答应，拖延不去。革委会成员了解到他的思想顾虑后，就给他讲精兵简政的意义，干部要能上能下，“既当‘官’，又当老百姓”的道理，用毛泽东思想治好了这个同志的思想毛病，使他愉快地走上农村第一线，担负起宣传毛泽东思想的光荣任务。
    有个同志是在无产阶级文化大革命运动初期从资产阶级反动路线的压抑下冲杀出来的，认为“现在胜利了，该当干部掌权了”。可是，偏巧又碰上精兵简政，一时思想不通。革委会成员用毛主席的“我们共产党人不是要做官，而是要革命”的教导，启发教育了他，使他也愉快地服从了党的分配。
    灵宝县的同志告诉我们：如果不开展斗私批修，不触及人的灵魂，不促进人的思想革命化，实行精兵简政的阻力是很大的。只有大破资产阶级的“私”字，大立无产阶级的“公”字，才能顺利进行精兵简政的工作。关键在于转变作风
    机构精简以后，人少事多怎么办？这是人们普遍关心的一个问题。
    灵宝县在文化大革命前也多次进行过精简，可是，过不多久人员又慢慢增加，机构越来越庞大了。这是为什么？其中一个重要的原因就是人的思想作风没有变，仍然不能彻底解决问题。
    这次灵宝县革委会实行精兵简政以后，就突出地狠抓了革委会成员的思想作风革命化。县革委会的负责人经常对同志们说：“实行精兵简政以后，人少事多怎么办？我们一是千头万绪抓根本，用伟大的毛泽东思想统帅一切；二是相信群众，依靠群众，深入群众，走群众路线，把大量的问题解决在基层。”他们以身作则，“既当‘官’，又当老百姓。”经常深入农村，到困难最大，情况最复杂，工作最艰苦的地方去。发动群众，依靠群众，把问题解决好。
    在灵宝，我们听了不少这样的故事：
    苏村公社两派长期联合不起来，经常到县里要求协助解决，县里的同志由于不了解情况，光凭汇报判断是非，只好一个扁担三、一个三扁担地在中间和稀泥，结果群众来县里将近二十次，拖了半年之久，问题还得不到解决。今年一月三日，县革委会成立了，并且实行了精兵简政，一个常委带着毛主席最新指示到了那里，经过调查，找到了问题的关键，和大家一起共同学习，斗私批修，两派很快就联合起来了，并且迅速成立了革委会。事实证明，作风转变了，领导不是光靠听汇报解决问题，而是走出机关，深入群众，问题就比较容易解决。
    最近，灵宝县开办了一期一百五十多人的干部毛泽东思想学习班。按过去的老办法，光负责组织这期学习班就需要五六个人。可是，这次只有两个人。在这种情况下，负责组织学习班的同志遵照毛主席的教导，改变了过去“我作报告你讨论，你有问题我纠正”的老一套作法，放手发动群众，处处依靠群众，由群众订学习计划，请群众当辅导员，和群众一起圆满地完成了学习任务。事实证明，作风转变了，领导不是光靠少数人包办代替，而是发动群众，依靠群众，问题就容易解决了。
    精兵，不仅在“兵”少，更在于“兵”有一个革命化的思想作风；抓了思想革命化，组织革命化就有了保证。灵宝县革委会一位常委说：“我们实行精兵简政，其中一个目的就是为了更好地发动广大革命群众关心和管理国家大事。只要坚决依靠群众，充分发动群众，事情就会办得更好。”今天灵宝县的现实充分说明了这一点。“必须警惕走回头路！”
    谈到要勇敢地跳出原来旧机构的圈子，灵宝县革委会的一位常委，意味深长地向我们说了一句话：“走回头路最容易。”
    的确，走“回头路”比起走一条新路，当然容易。
    从灵宝县革委会实行精兵简政后一个多月的情况看，新的革命机构，同旧的观念，旧的不良作风，存在着尖锐的矛盾。官僚主义习气，旧的习惯势力一直在从各方面干扰和冲击这个革命的新机构。
    曾经发生过这样的事：精兵简政方案刚订下来，具体到各组调配人员时，一位常委就为了自己负责的那个组多要一两个工作人员，与其他同志吵得脸红脖子粗。
    也曾经出现过这样的事：工作刚开始，有一位常委又发生了过去一人说了算数的老毛病，没有到群众中去调查，情况不了解，就在那里指手划脚，发号施令。……
    旧的习惯势力就这样顽强地表现出来。它象一只死老鼠，在我们中间腐烂发臭，从各个方面用陈腐的死亡的东西包围我们年轻的、生气勃勃的革命机构。
    毛主席教导我们：“现状和习惯往往容易把人们的头脑束缚得紧紧的，即使是革命者有时也不能免。”
    灵宝县革委会一些工农出身的革命干部在这方面体会最深。他们回忆自己从基层刚进机关门时，对官僚主义习气、旧的习惯势力，开始觉得不习惯，甚至抵制过，但是时间长了，自己就不再坚持斗争，渐渐地也就习以为常了。现在一下子要改，又觉得不习惯，甚至不舒服。他们说：对旧的习惯势力，只要你放松警惕，随波逐流，任其左右，就会慢慢失去雄心，失去革命性，最后变为修正主义的苗子。
      “必须警惕走回头路！”灵宝县革委会的同志下了这样的决心，在实行精兵简政以后，他们一直站在迎头痛击旧的习惯势力的最前线。
    县革委会抓革命促生产指挥组只有八个人，承担了农业、林业、水利、工交、财贸等方面的工作。今年夏粮征购工作一开始，一些同志又不自觉地把过去那老一套搬出来了，一古脑儿钻进业务堆里，埋头抓事务，整天打电话。县革委会及时发觉了这个不好的苗头，立即组织大家反复学习毛主席关于“政治工作是一切经济工作的生命线”的教导，批判旧县委、旧县人委生产办公室严重脱离群众，脱离无产阶级政治的错误倾向，使大家迅速走出办公室，离开电话机，深入群众，狠抓根本，走突出无产阶级政治的道路。这些同志深入基层后，很快就发现了西阎公社大字营大队活学活用毛主席著作搞得好，狠抓了阶级斗争，夏粮征购进度特别快，于是就在这个大队召开了现场会，推广了他们的经验，很快就在全县掀起了一个抓革命促生产的高潮，夏粮征购任务完成得又快又好。
    目前，灵宝县革委会正在毛泽东思想伟大红旗指引下，进一步批判中国赫鲁晓夫在政权建设方面所推行的反革命修正主义路线，批判保守主义，击破剥削阶级旧势力的抵抗，为“组织起一个革命化的联系群众的领导班子”，实现“精简、统一、效能、节约和反对官僚主义五项目的”而阔步迈进。
