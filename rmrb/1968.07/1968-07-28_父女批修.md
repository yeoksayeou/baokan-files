One morning, after having breakfast, militia deputy platoon leader Xu Yunxiu picked up her hoe to go to the fields. Her father, Xu Yueyi, suddenly called out, “Yunxiu, don’t go down to the fields today. Our private plot’s two ridges of ginseng are almost dying from drought. I can’t go to water them, so you hurry and water them! Every extra jin of ginseng is more than two yuan.”

Yunxiu did not listen to her father’s words and turned to leave. As she walked, she thought more and more about it, and the more she thought, the more she felt something was wrong. This wasn’t just a small problem with two ridges of ginseng; it was a struggle between public and private interests. She also thought, “Father is an old poor peasant. He has always loved Chairman Mao and socialism. Why is he now calculating over two ridges of ginseng?” She realized this was the result of being poisoned by the “money-first” and “get-rich” ideas of that big bad guy, Chinese Khrushchev. Tonight, she would definitely hold a criticism session and together with her father, thoroughly criticize Chinese Khrushchev’s counter-revolutionary revisionist poison.

After dinner, the criticism session began. Yunxiu spoke first, saying, “Chairman Mao teaches us: ‘Only socialism can save China.’ But Chinese Khrushchev goes against Chairman Mao, advocating ‘money-first’ and thinking only of money! He also maliciously slanders us, saying that ‘peasants like to get rich.’ He is trying to corrupt our souls with bourgeois ‘selfishness’ and lead us down the capitalist road. We must not fall for Chinese Khrushchev’s tricks!”

Old man Yueyi interrupted Yunxiu, saying, “Just thinking about the old society makes my whole body tremble. I started working for the landlord at nine years old and worked my feet into disability. It was only because of Chairman Mao that we were pulled out of the sea of suffering. This bad guy, Chinese Khrushchev, wants to push us back into the old society, but that is absolutely impossible!”

Seeing that her father’s thinking had opened up, Yunxiu continued, “We poor and lower-middle peasants must always think of socialism, look at socialism, walk towards socialism, and strive for socialism.” Yunxiu spoke to this point, and her father thought of the matter of watering the ginseng. He said, “This morning, I was calculating with a ‘selfish’ mindset. From now on, I will definitely smash this small calculator and further eliminate the poison of Chinese Khrushchev.”

The criticism session went on until late at night. Father and daughter grew more and more loving towards Chairman Mao and more and more hateful towards Chinese Khrushchev and the bourgeois ‘selfishness’ in their minds. After this big criticism, Xu Yueyi not only actively supported Yunxiu in participating in collective production labor and resolutely walking the socialist road, but also often dragged his two disabled feet to participate in the team’s production labor to the best of his ability.

    父女批修
    一天早上，民兵副连长徐云秀吃过早饭扛起锄头要下地，父亲徐月一突然喊道：“云秀，今天别下坡啦，咱自留地那两畦子参快要旱死啦，我不能去浇，你赶快去浇一浇！多收一斤参就是两元多。”
    云秀没有听爹的话，转身就走。她边走边想，越想越觉得不是味。这不是两畦子参的小问题，而是公与私的斗争。又想，爹是个老贫农，从来就热爱伟大领袖毛主席，热爱社会主义，今天又为什么围绕着两畦子参打起小算盘来呢？这是中了中国赫鲁晓夫这个大坏蛋的“金钱挂帅”、“发家致富”的毒。晚上一定开个批判会，和爹一块狠批中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义黑货。
    晚饭后，批判会开始了。云秀首先发言，她说：“毛主席他老人家教导我们：‘只有社会主义能够救中国。’而中国赫鲁晓夫却同毛主席大唱反调，大肆鼓吹‘金钱挂帅’，满脑袋是钱！钱！钱！他还恶毒地诬蔑我们，胡说什么‘农民就是喜欢发财’。他这是企图用资产阶级的‘私’字来腐蚀我们的灵魂，叫我们跟着他走资本主义道路，咱可千万不能上中国赫鲁晓夫的当！”
    月一老人打断了云秀的话说：“提起旧社会，我浑身发抖。我从九岁给地主干活，把两只脚全累残了，多亏了毛主席才把咱从苦海里拉出来。中国赫鲁晓夫这个坏蛋想把咱重新推回旧社会，万万办不到！”
    云秀看爹思想开窍了，就接着说：“咱贫下中农要时时刻刻心往社会主义上想，眼往社会主义上看，腿往社会主义上迈，劲往社会主义上使。”云秀说到这里，爹想起了浇参的事。他说：“早晨，我打的是‘私’字小算盘，今后坚决把这个小算盘砸碎，进一步消除中国赫鲁晓夫的毒害。”
    批判会一直开到深夜。父女俩越批越热爱毛主席，越批越恨中国赫鲁晓夫，越恨自己头脑中资产阶级的“私”字。徐月一经过这次大批判，不仅积极支持云秀参加集体生产劳动，坚决走社会主义道路，自己还经常拖着两只残废的脚，参加队里的力所能及的生产劳动。
