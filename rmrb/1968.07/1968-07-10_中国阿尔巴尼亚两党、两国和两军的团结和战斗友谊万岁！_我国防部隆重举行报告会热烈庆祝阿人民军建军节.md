The Ministry of National Defense of our country solemnly held a report meeting to enthusiastically celebrate the 25th anniversary of the founding of the Albanian People's Army.

The hall was adorned with portraits of Chairman Mao Zedong, the great leader of the Chinese people, and Comrade Enver Hoxha, the great leader of the Albanian people. Opposite the stage, a large banner read: "Long Live the Unity and Combat Friendship of the Two Parties, Two Countries, and Two Armies of China and Albania!" The meeting began with the singing of "The Internationale" and the recitation of quotations from Chairman Mao and Comrade Enver Hoxha.

The Chargé d'Affaires of the Albanian Embassy in China, Babaani, the military attaché, Hakan, and other diplomatic officials were invited to attend the report meeting.

Vice Minister of National Defense, Su Yu, spoke at the meeting. He, on behalf of the Ministry of National Defense and the PLA units in Beijing, extended the warmest congratulations to the fraternal Albanian people and all the officers and soldiers of the Albanian People's Army.

Comrade Su Yu praised the Albanian People's Army as a heroic people's army. He said, "Now, the Albanian People's Army, under the guidance of Comrade Enver Hoxha, is striving to build itself into 'a powerful army closely linked with the working people, an army led by the party, an army tempered in political and ideological struggles, an army excellently armed with the military science of Marxism-Leninism, an army equipped with modern weapons, and an army ready to resist any enemy at any time.' We sincerely wish the fraternal Albanian People's Army continued great achievements on the path of revolutionization and in the cause of defending and building the motherland."

He said, "The heroic Albanian people and the Albanian People's Army, united as steel around the Albanian Party of Labor led by Comrade Enver Hoxha, have raised the red flag of Marxism-Leninism high in Europe, where imperialism is in its death throes and revisionism is rampant. In the struggle against imperialism headed by the United States and modern revisionism centered on the Soviet revisionist clique, and in the great cause of socialist revolution and socialist construction, they have won one brilliant victory after another."

Comrade Su Yu said, "Our great leader Chairman Mao said: 'The Communist Party of China and the Party of Labor of Albania, the Chinese and Albanian peoples, the Marxist-Leninists of the whole world, and the revolutionary people of the whole world should unite as one. Down with imperialism! Down with modern revisionism! Down with the reactionaries of all countries! A new world without imperialism, without capitalism, and without systems of exploitation will certainly be built.' We will certainly follow Chairman Mao's teachings, forever stand together with our Albanian comrades, and unite with all Marxist-Leninists and revolutionary people of the world. We will fight shoulder to shoulder to accomplish this glorious historical mission!"

Comrade Su Yu said, "We must learn from the comrades of the Albanian People's Army, who are loyal to the party, loyal to the people, and loyal to the revolution. We must better fulfill the glorious mission entrusted to us by our great leader Chairman Mao, strive for the complete victory of our country's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and build our army into a revolutionary army that is extremely proletarianized and extremely combat-ready, absolutely loyal to Chairman Mao, absolutely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and absolutely loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line!"

Comrade Hakan gave an enthusiastic report amid warm applause. He said, "The two Marxist-Leninist parties—the Communist Party of China led by Chairman Mao Zedong, the dearest friend of the Albanian people, and the Party of Labor of Albania led by Comrade Enver Hoxha, the beloved leader of the Albanian people and the closest friend and comrade of the Chinese people—are constantly strengthening and tempering the great friendship between our two peoples and our two armies. We will protect this friendship as we protect our own eyes."

In his report, he introduced the glorious history of the Albanian Party organizing the people to launch an armed uprising and seize power, as well as the great merits of establishing the people's army. He said, "On the occasion of the 25th anniversary of the founding of our army, our army is effectively conducting war preparedness and is ready at any time to defend our socialist motherland and revolutionary cause against any enemy who dares to invade our sacred borders and obstruct our progress on the revolutionary path. He pointed out that the strength of the Albanian People's Army lies first in its high political and ideological awareness, in the fact that every soldier is fully aware of his duty: all his work, all his statements, and actions should serve the interests of the party and the people."

Comrade Hakan said, "Our army, following the party and Comrade Enver Hoxha's teachings, is increasingly strengthening and tempering its ties with the people. Our army is a new type of army, a people's army, a weapon of the dictatorship of the proletariat. The achievements of our army over the past 25 years are the result of the correct leadership of the Party of Labor in accordance with Marxism-Leninism. As Comrade Enver Hoxha said: 'Our army is trained and tempered by the policies of our party. Its entire life and work have never been separated from the policy goals of the party and the people's power.'"

In discussing the current favorable international situation, he said, "The national liberation movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America are developing and expanding. Anti-imperialist flames are burning everywhere. The conspiracies of imperialism and revisionism to obstruct the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of various countries are doomed to be smashed by the peoples of various countries. He said, "The Albanian people, like the 700 million Chinese people, have always firmly supported the just war of the Vietnamese people to resist America and save the country."

Comrade Hakan strongly condemned the Soviet revisionist clique's collusion with American imperialism against the People's Republic of China and the revolutionary movements of the peoples of various countries. In discussing the combat friendship between China and Albania in the struggle against imperialism and revisionism, he said, "Although we are far apart, we are united as one. Comrade Mao Zedong said: 'The Chinese and Albanian peoples are far apart across mountains and rivers, but our hearts are connected. We are your true friends and comrades. You are our true friends and comrades. ... No matter what happens in the world, our two parties and peoples will definitely unite, fight together, and win together.'"

Comrade Hakan said, "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao is marching towards complete victory. The victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is the victory of Marxism-Leninism over revisionism, the victory of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line over the counter-revolutionary revisionist line. Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, the Chinese people have smashed the plans and hopes of the imperialists and revisionists to restore capitalism in China."

He said, "The great achievements of China make the Albanian people and their army feel jubilant. Because every one of your victories is our victory. All revolutionary peoples of the world regard Mao Zedong's China as their loyal ally and defender, as the main bastion of socialism and a powerful base for world revolution. He wished the Chinese people and the Chinese People's Liberation Army, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao Zedong, new and even greater victories.

Comrade Hakan's report was met with extremely enthusiastic applause.

Responsible comrades from various departments and services of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, such as Wang Xinting, and more than 2,000 officers and soldiers from the army, navy, and air force participated in the report meeting. At the end of the meeting, everyone stood up and sang "The East Is Red." After the meeting, an Albanian film was screened.

At the same time as the report meeting, the Ministry of National Defense also displayed pictures reflecting the glorious fighting history of the Albanian People's Army under the wise leadership of Comrade Enver Hoxha and the Party of Labor. (See pictures)

The Ministry of National Defense solemnly held a report meeting on July 9 to enthusiastically celebrate the 25th anniversary of the founding of the Albanian People's Army. Comrade Hakan, the military attaché of the Albanian Embassy in China, was invited to give an enthusiastic report at the meeting, which was warmly welcomed by all the officers and soldiers.

    中国阿尔巴尼亚两党、两国和两军的团结和战斗友谊万岁！
    我国防部隆重举行报告会热烈庆祝阿人民军建军节
    新华社九日讯　我国防部今天下午隆重举行报告会，热烈庆祝阿尔巴尼亚人民军建军二十五周年。
    大会主席台上高挂着中国人民的伟大领袖毛主席的画像和阿尔巴尼亚人民的伟大领袖恩维尔·霍查同志的画像。主席台对面挂着巨幅横标，写着：“中阿两党、两国和两军的团结和战斗友谊万岁！”大会开始时，全场高唱《国际歌》，齐声朗读毛主席语录和恩维尔·霍查同志语录。
    阿尔巴尼亚驻中国大使馆临时代办巴巴尼、大使馆武官哈卡尼和大使馆外交官员，应邀出席了报告会。
    国防部副部长粟裕在会上讲话。他代表我国国防部和中国人民解放军驻京部队，向兄弟的阿尔巴尼亚人民和人民军全体指战员，致以最热烈的节日祝贺。
    粟裕同志赞扬阿尔巴尼亚人民军是一支英雄的人民军队。他说，现在，阿尔巴尼亚人民军遵循恩维尔·霍查同志的教导，正在把自己建设成“一支强大的同劳动人民紧密联系的军队，一支受党的领导的、经受过政治上和思想上的锻炼的、出色地用马克思列宁主义的军事科学武装起来的军队，一支用现代化武器装备起来的、时刻准备抵抗任何敌人的军队。”我们衷心祝愿兄弟的阿尔巴尼亚人民军在革命化的道路上，在保卫和建设祖国的事业中继续取得新的伟大的成就。
      他说，英雄的阿尔巴尼亚人民和阿尔巴尼亚人
  民军，钢铁般地团结在以恩维尔·霍查同志为首的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党周围，在帝国主义垂死挣扎和修正主义泛滥的欧洲，高举着马克思列宁主义的革命
  红旗，在同以美国为首的帝国主义和以苏修叛徒集团为中心的现代修正主义的斗争中，在伟大的社会主义革命和社会主义建设事业中，取得了一个又一个的辉煌胜利。
    粟裕同志说，我们的伟大领袖毛主席说：“中阿两党、两国人民团结起来，全世界马克思列宁主义者团结起来，全世界革命人民团结起来，打倒帝国主义，打倒现代修正主义，打倒各国反动派。一个没有帝国主义、没有资本主义、没有剥削制度的新世界，一定要建立起来”。我们一定遵循毛主席的教导，永远同阿尔巴尼亚战友们团结在一起，同全世界的马克思列宁主义者和革命人民团结在一起，并肩战斗，为完成这一光荣的历史任务而奋斗到底！
    粟裕同志说，我们一定要学习阿尔巴尼亚人民军战友们忠于党、忠于人民、忠于革命的崇高品质，更好地完成伟大领袖毛主席交给我们的光荣任务，为夺取我国无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利，为把我军建成一支无限忠于毛主席、无限忠于毛泽东思想、无限忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的非常无产阶级化、非常战斗化的革命军队而奋斗！
    哈卡尼同志在热烈的掌声中作了热情洋溢的报告。他说，我们两个马克思列宁主义的党——以阿尔巴尼亚人民最亲爱的朋友毛泽东主席为首的中国共产党和以阿尔巴尼亚人民的亲爱的领袖、中国人民最亲密的朋友和战友恩维尔·霍查同志为首的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党，每天都在加强和锤炼我们两国人
  民和两国军队之间的伟大友谊。我们将象保护自己眼珠一样，保护这种友谊。
    他在报告中介绍了以
  恩维尔·霍查同志为首的阿尔巴尼亚党组织人民进行武装起义，夺取政权的光辉斗争历史，以及创建人民军队的伟大功勋。他说，在建军二十五周年的时候，我军卓有成效地进行着战备，随时可以保卫我们社会主义祖国和革命事业，对付任何敢于侵犯祖国神圣边防和阻碍我们在革命的道路上前进的敌人的阴谋。他指出，阿尔巴尼亚人民军的力量首先在于她的高度的政治思想觉悟，在于每一个军人充分地意识到自己的职责：他们的一切工作、一切表态和行动都应该服务于党和人民的利益。
    哈卡尼同志说，我军遵照党和恩维尔·霍查同志的教导，日益加强和锤炼同人民的联系。我军是一支新型的军队，是人民的军队，是无产阶级专政的武器。二十五年来我军所取得的成就，是劳动党按照马克思列宁主义正确领导的结果。正如恩维尔·霍查同志所说：“我军是由我们党的政策培养和锻炼起来的。她的整个生活和工作，时刻都没有同党和人民政权的政策目标分离过。”
    他在谈到当前的大好国际形势时说，亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲的民族解放运动正在不断地发展和扩大。到处都日益燃起反帝的战火。帝国主义和修正主义企图阻止各国人民革命斗争发展的阴谋，是注定要被各国人民所粉碎的。他说，阿尔巴尼亚人民同七亿中国人民一样，始终如一地坚决支持兄弟的越南人民抗美救国的正义战争。
    哈卡尼同志强烈谴责苏修叛徒集团勾结美帝国主义反对中华人民共和国、反对各国人民的革命运动。他在谈到中阿两国在反帝、反修斗争中的战斗友谊时说，我们虽然远隔两地，但我们团结得象一个人一样。毛泽东同志说：“中阿两国远隔千山万水，我们的心是连在一起的。我们是你们真正的朋友和同志。你们也是我们真正的朋友和同志。……不管世界上发生什么事情，我们两党、两国人民，一定团结在一起，战斗在一起，胜利在一起。”
    哈卡尼同志说，毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命正在走向全面胜利。无产阶级文化大革命的胜利是马克思列宁主义对修正主义的胜利，是毛主席的无产阶级革命路线对反革命修正主义路线的胜利。中国人民在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，粉碎了帝国主义者和修正主义者企图在中国复辟资本主义的计划和希望。
    他说，中国的伟大成就，使阿尔巴尼亚人民及其军队感到欢欣鼓舞。因为你们的每个胜利也是我们的胜利。全世界一切革命人民把毛泽东的中国看成是他们忠实的盟友和捍卫者，看成是社会主义的主要堡垒和世界革命的强大基地。他祝愿中国人民和中国人民解放军在中国共产党和毛泽东主席的领导下，取得新的更加伟大的胜利。
    哈卡尼同志的报告受到了极其热烈的欢迎。
    中国人民解放军各总部、各军种兵种的负责同志王新亭等和陆、海、空军指战员二千多人，参加了报告会。大会结束时，全场起立，高唱《大海航行靠舵手》。会后，放映了阿尔巴尼亚影片。
    我国防部在举行报告会的同时，还展出了反映在以恩维尔·霍查同志为首的劳动党英明领导下的阿尔巴尼亚人民军光辉战斗历程的图片。（附图片）
