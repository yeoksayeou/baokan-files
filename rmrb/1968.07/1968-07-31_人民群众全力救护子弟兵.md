A soldier fell ill while on duty. The revolutionary masses on the island, undeterred by a strong typhoon, traveled over twenty miles by water, rowing a small boat to send the soldier to the hospital, ensuring he received timely treatment.

On the morning of May 16, Comrade Zhou Zhiping, the platoon leader of the 3rd Company of the 6858th Unit, led a small team to a remote outpost on a small island in the South China Sea to carry out a mission. Suddenly, he fell seriously ill and collapsed. On this remote island, there were no doctors or hospitals. The islanders who heard the news were extremely worried. They thought: The soldiers guard the island day and night, protecting the motherland, and during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, they bear the glorious tasks of "three-in-one" and "two supports," establishing immortal merits for the people. Today, Comrade Zhou is ill, and we must do everything possible to rescue him. We must overcome any difficulty, no matter how great. They immediately reported to the commune revolutionary committee while searching for medicine and administering treatment. However, after more than an hour, Comrade Zhou had not recovered. His face was pale, and his breathing became more difficult, his life hanging by a thread. The poor and lower-middle peasants were extremely anxious and said:

"We must immediately send Comrade Zhou to the military hospital." The distance to the military hospital was twenty to thirty miles, and all the boats had gone out to transport goods and catch fish. What should they do?

Just then, Comrade He Mianquan, a standing committee member of the Nan Shui Commune Revolutionary Committee, heard the news and rowed a small boat to the scene. The poor and lower-middle peasants immediately carried Comrade Zhou onto the boat, preparing to set off for the nearby hospital. Suddenly, lightning flashed and thunder roared, signaling the imminent arrival of a strong typhoon. According to standard procedures, even large ships should not venture out. Everyone looked at the small boat in front of them and thought about the twenty-plus miles ahead, feeling their hearts tighten with anxiety.

At this moment, Comrade He Mianquan excitedly said to everyone: "The army is sent by Chairman Mao, and loving the army is a manifestation of our poor and lower-middle peasants' loyalty to Chairman Mao. Countless heroes have given their lives for us, and we must spare no effort to rescue the soldiers. The wind and waves are fierce, but our resolve to be loyal to Chairman Mao is greater; the tides are swift, but our urgency to save a life is greater. We must overcome all difficulties and safely send Comrade Zhou to the hospital." As soon as Comrade He Mianquan finished speaking, several militia members volunteered to escort Comrade Zhou. Under Comrade He Mianquan's leadership, they braved the pouring rain, fierce winds, and rough seas, reciting Chairman Mao's quotations such as "This army possesses an indomitable spirit, it will vanquish all enemies and never be subdued by them," and "Resolutely determined, fearing no sacrifice, overcoming all difficulties, and striving for victory." They overcame countless obstacles and surmounted all difficulties, battling against the wind and waves, forging ahead. Along the way, waves crashed into the boat, but the militia members, soaked to the skin, ensured that not a drop of water touched Comrade Zhou. After more than an hour of intense struggle, guided by the invincible thought of Mao Zedong, they finally safely delivered Comrade Zhou to the hospital.

    人民群众全力救护子弟兵
    一位解放军同志在值勤中病倒了。岛上的革命群众不怕强台风的袭击，走了二十多里水路，划着小船把解放军同志送到了医院，使他得到及时的治疗。
    五月十六日早晨，六八五八部队三连排长周志平同志，带领一支小分队在一个偏僻的南海前哨小岛上单独执行任务时，突然身患急病，晕倒在地。在这边远的小岛上，既无医生，又没有医院，可把闻讯赶来的岛上群众急坏了。他们想：解放军日日夜夜地守在海岛，保卫祖国，在无产阶级文化大革命中，更是肩负着“三支”、“两军”的光荣任务，为人民立下了不朽的功勋。今天，老周病了，我们一定要想尽办法进行抢救，就是天大的困难也要克服。他们一面打电话报告公社革委会，一面分头找药，进行治疗。可是一个多小时过去了，还没有抢救过来。这时，周排长的脸色发白，呼吸越来越困难，生命危在旦夕。贫下中农都非常焦急地说：
  “必须马上把老周送到部队医院。”这里离部队医院有二、三十里路，船又全出去运货捕鱼去了，怎么办呢？
    正在这时，岛上南水公社革委会常委何勉泉同志闻讯后，划着一只小船赶来。贫下中农立刻把周排长抬到船上，准备向附近医院出发。顷刻之间，电光闪闪，雷声隆隆，强台风就要来临了。按常规，就是大船也不能外出。大家看着面前摆着的一只小船，想想二十多华里的路程，不由得心情又紧张起来。
    这时，何勉泉同志激动地对大家说：“解放军是毛主席派来的，爱护解放军，就是体现我们贫下中农忠于毛主席的一片忠心。无数英雄为我们献出了生命，我们一定要不惜任何代价来抢救解放军。风浪大，没有我们忠于毛主席的决心大；潮水急，没有我们抢救亲人的生命急。我们一定要克服一切困难，把周排长安全送到医院去。”何勉泉同志的话音刚落，几个基干民兵自告奋勇要求担任护送周排长的任务。他们在何勉泉同志的率领下，冒着倾盆大雨，顶着狂风恶浪，念着“这个军队具有一往无前的精神，它要压倒一切敌人，而决不被敌人所屈服”、“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”等毛主席语录，克服重重困难，战胜种种阻力，迎风破浪，勇往直前。一路上浪头往船里打，民兵们宁愿自己全身湿透，也不让周排长身上有半点水。经过一个多小时的紧张战斗，他们在战无不胜的毛泽东思想指引下，终于把周排长安全送到了医院。
