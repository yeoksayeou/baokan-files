The wave of struggles by the Italian people continues to surge. On the 9th, over 20,000 earthquake victims from Sicily gathered in the island's capital, Palermo, for a massive demonstration. The strike movement by Italian workers against the brutal exploitation of the monopolistic bourgeoisie has swept across many important cities and regions nationwide.

In recent years, the lives of the working people in southern Italy, including Sicily, have become increasingly difficult. The severe earthquake that struck Sicily in January this year has further deepened the suffering of the local working people. The ruthless exploitation and oppression of the people by the Italian reactionary authorities, as well as their indifferent attitude towards the victims, have sparked great indignation among the people of Sicily. Recently, many towns in this region have seen waves of strikes and protests.

On the 9th, over 20,000 earthquake victims from various parts of Sicily converged on the island's capital, Palermo, to hold a demonstration, expressing their anger and protest against the reactionary ruling authorities. Thousands of victims traveled by train, bus, or on foot to Palermo, causing long-term paralysis of traffic in the city and its suburbs. They gathered in a square in the city and formed a two-kilometer-long procession, marching through the city center. Along the way, they shouted slogans denouncing the government. Their placards read: "Our children are sick, our elderly are tormented by suffering and poverty!" "We need jobs!" "We need houses, schools, and hospitals!"

The Italian authorities dispatched a large number of police, who repeatedly attacked the crowd in an attempt to disperse the demonstrators. The enraged demonstrators broke through the barriers and headed towards the regional government and assembly of Sicily, intending to enter the government building to confront the officials who refused to meet with the people and present their serious protests. The Italian reactionary authorities were terrified and hastily ordered the police to use tear gas and wield batons to brutally suppress the crowd. The demonstrators fought back with stones, bottles, and rotten fruit. They battled the police all day until evening. More than fifty people were injured by the police. A large number of demonstrators were unlawfully arrested.

Meanwhile, the wave of strikes by Italian workers against the brutal exploitation of the monopolistic bourgeoisie, demanding wage increases, improved working conditions, and full employment, has been surging in many industries.

In Rome and Milan, typesetters went on strike for 24 hours on the 9th, preventing all newspapers in these two cities from being published. The teletype operators of these newspapers then went on strike on the 10th. Typesetters in other provinces have decided to go on strike in rotation to protest the capitalists' refusal to accept the workers' reasonable demands.

The strike wave has recently swept through the metallurgical industry in Milan, Turin, Genoa, and the shipyards in Ancona and Palermo. Italy's chemical, sugar, cement, textile, and garment industries have also been hit by the strike wave. Workers in many provinces, including Rome and Trieste, as well as in departments such as railways and docks, have decided to hold a series of strikes in mid-July.

The rising people's movement has made the Italian ruling class restless. They cannot help but worry, lamenting that Italy is facing a "hot and turbulent summer."

    意大利工人斗争此伏彼起席卷全国
    西西里两万地震灾民举行大示威抗议反动当局漠视人民利益　人民运动的高涨使统治集团寝食不安，哀叹面临“炎热而动荡的夏天”
    新华社十一日讯　罗马消息：意大利人民群众斗争的浪潮继续汹涌澎湃。西西里岛的地震灾民二万多人，九日在这个大岛的首府巴勒莫举行声势浩大的示威游行。意大利工人反对垄断资产阶级残酷剥削的罢工斗争，席卷全国许多重要的城市和地区。
    近年来，意大利南部的西西里等地区劳动人民的生活日益困苦。今年一月在西西里区发生的猛烈地震，又加深了当地劳动人民的苦难。意大利反动当局对人民的残酷剥削和压迫，以及它对灾民的冷漠态度，激起了西西里人民极大的愤慨。这个地区的许多城镇，最近接连爆发了罢工和示威抗议的怒潮。
    九日，二万多地震灾民从西西里岛各地汇集到这个岛的首府巴勒莫，举行示威，对反动统治当局表示愤怒的抗议。成千成万的灾民乘火车、公共汽车或者步行涌进巴勒莫，使市区和郊区的交通长时间陷于瘫痪。他们在市内的一个广场集会，组成了一支二公里长的队伍，穿过市中心区举行了示威游行。他们沿途高呼谴责政府的口号。他们手中的标语牌上写着：“我们的孩子在生病，我们的老人被苦难和贫困折磨得快要死了！”“我们需要工作！”“我们需要房子、学校和医院！”
    意大利当局出动了大批警察，多次袭击群众，妄图驱散示威的队伍。愤怒的示威群众突破了重重障碍，来到西西里区政府和区议会面前，准备冲进区政府，对拒绝同群众见面的政府官员当面提出严正的抗议。意大利反动当局吓得要命，慌忙指使警察使用催泪弹，挥舞棍棒对群众进行野蛮的镇压。示威者以石块、瓶子和烂水果英勇还击。他们同警察整日搏斗，直到傍晚。警察打伤了五十多人。大批示威者被无理逮捕。
    与此同时，意大利工人反对垄断资产阶级的残酷剥削，要求增加工资、改善工作条件和充分就业的罢工浪潮此伏彼起，席卷许多行业。
    在罗马和米兰，报纸的排字工人九日举行了二十四小时的罢工，使这两个大城市的所有报纸无法出版。这些报纸的电传打字人员接着在十日举行罢工。其他省市报纸的排字工人已决定轮流举行罢工，对资本家拒绝接受工人的合理要求表示抗议。
      罢工的浪潮最近席卷了米兰、都灵、热那亚的冶金工业以及安科纳和巴勒莫的造船厂。意大利的化学、制糖、水泥、纺织和成衣工业，也受到罢工浪潮的冲击。罗马、的里雅斯特等许多省市，以及铁路、码头等许多部门的工人，已经决定在七月中旬举行一系列的罢工。
    人民运动的日益高涨使意大利统治集团寝食不安。他们不禁忧心忡忡地哀叹，意大利面临着一个“炎热而动荡的夏天”。
