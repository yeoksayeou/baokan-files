About a thousand workers in Tokyo held a rally on the evening of July 2 in Hibiya Park, Tokyo, demanding the withdrawal of U.S. imperialist military bases in Japan and the abolition of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty." They also strongly opposed the U.S. military's plan to increase the transport of jet fuel for U.S. military aircraft on Japanese National Railways tank cars. The workers at the rally unanimously expressed their determination to carry the struggle through to the end.

Fukutaro Kenmoto, Vice-Chairman of the Japanese Trade Union Confederation, spoke at the rally, highly praising the struggle launched by Japanese workers, students, and citizens on June 26 and 28 in Tokyo's Shinjuku and Akishima to stop the transport of fuel for U.S. military jets. He said, "The current struggle sweeping across Japan to demand the withdrawal of U.S. military bases and to stop the transport of U.S. military ammunition is a very important struggle for the abolition of the U.S.-Japan 'Security Treaty.' Let us unite the strength of the broad masses, smash the U.S.-Japan 'Security Treaty,' and carry on our struggle until we achieve final victory."

A representative of the National Railways Workers' Union emphasized in his speech that the plots of U.S. imperialism and the reactionary Sato government have met with strong resistance from the Japanese people from the very beginning. They have been forced to postpone their plan to increase the transport of jet fuel for the U.S. military starting from July 1. However, they are trying to secretly enforce the original plan. We must exert our utmost strength to persist in the struggle and launch a relentless attack on the U.S.-Japan reactionaries.

A representative from the Chikujo district of Fukuoka Prefecture reported on the struggle of the people of Kyushu against U.S. military bases and expressed their determination to continue the struggle.

On June 30 and July 1, about 200 patriotic youth and students in Tokyo held consecutive protests at the Haijima, Tachikawa, and Nakano National Railways stations, opposing the transport of fuel for U.S. military jets. These struggles forced the tank cars at the three stations to stop transporting fuel.

According to reports from Xinhua News Agency, about 2,000 students, workers, and citizens in Osaka, Kyoto, and Kobe held a rally and demonstration on the evening of June 28 in Osaka City, demanding the abolition of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" and strongly protesting the Sato reactionary government's active participation in the ministerial-level meeting of the Asian and Pacific Council, scheduled for July in Canberra, involving puppet governments of various Asian countries.

On the evening of June 28, more than 500 students and young workers held a rally in a park in Osaka City, followed by a demonstration. More than 1,000 citizens also participated in the demonstration.

Another group of about 700 students also set out simultaneously to hold a demonstration.

The demonstrators shouted slogans: "Smash the U.S.-Japan 'Security Treaty'!" "Smash the Asian and Pacific Council Meeting!" The Sato government's 3,000 armed police rushed to suppress the demonstration, but the workers and students bravely fought back with paving stones and sticks. They destroyed three police cars and ransacked a nearby police station. As a result, traffic in the center of Osaka was paralyzed for three hours.

Japanese patriotic workers and students, holding high the red banner of "Long Live Mao Zedong Thought," fought side by side, demonstrating the powerful force of the Japanese people's anti-U.S. struggle.

    在日本人民强大反击下美日反动派被迫推迟增运美喷气机燃料计划
    新华社三日讯　据东方通讯社报道：大约一千名东京工人二日晚上在东京的日比谷公园举行集会，要求撤除美帝国主义在日本的军事基地和废除日美“安全条约”，并且强烈反对美军要在日本国营铁道油槽车增加运输美军喷气式飞机燃料的计划。参加集会的工人一致表示决心把这一斗争进行到底。
    日本工会总评议会副议长兼田富太郎在会上讲了话，高度赞扬日本工人、学生和市民六月二十六日和二十八日在东京的新宿和昭岛发动的阻止为美军喷气式飞机运输燃料的斗争。他说：“现在正在全日本掀起的要求撤除美国军事基地和阻止运输美军弹药的斗争，是实现废除日美‘安全条约’的十分重要的斗争。让我们把广大群众的力量团结在一起，粉碎日美‘安全条约’，把我们的斗争进行下去，直到取得最后胜利。”
    国营铁道工会代表在讲话中强调说，美帝国主义和佐藤反动政府的阴谋从一开头就遭到日本人民的强大反击，它们不得不被迫推迟从七月一日起为美军增运喷气式飞机燃料的计划。但是它们企图偷偷地强制实行原先的计划。我们必须尽最大的力量坚持斗争，必须对美日反动派进行穷追猛打。
    福冈县筑城地区的代表在会上作了关于九州人民反对美国军事基地的斗争的报告，并且表示决心继续展开斗争。
    六月三十日和七月一日，东京爱国青年和学生约二百人在拜岛、立川和中野国营铁道车站路线场连续举行抗议示威，反对为美军喷气式飞机运输燃料。这些斗争迫使三个车站的油槽车停止运输燃料。
    据新华社讯　据东方通讯社报道：日本大阪、京都和神户的学生、工人和市民两千多人，六月二十八日晚在大阪市举行集会和示威游行，要求废除日美“安全条约”，并强烈抗议佐藤反动政府积极参加亚洲各国傀儡政府的代表预定七月份在堪培拉举行的亚洲和太平洋理事会部长级会议。
    二十八日晚上，五百多名学生和青年工人在大阪市的一个公园里举行集会，会后并举行示威游行。一千多名市民也参加了示威游行。
    另一支约有七百名学生组成的队伍也同时出发举行示威游行。
    示威群众高呼口号：“粉碎日美‘安全条约’！”“粉碎亚洲和太平洋理事会议！”佐藤政府的三千名武装警察赶来进行镇压，工人、学生们用铺路石块和木棍同武装警察展开了英勇的搏斗。他们摧毁了三辆警车，还捣毁了附近的一个警察所。大阪市中心交通因而瘫痪了三个小时。（附图片）
    日本爱国工人和学生高举“毛泽东思想万岁”的红旗，并肩进行战斗，显示了日本人民反美斗争的强大力量。
