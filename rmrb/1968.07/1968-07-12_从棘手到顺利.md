Since February this year, the number of tourists visiting Da Zhai from here has increased significantly. Although two temporary trains are added daily, many tourists still cannot depart on the same day. On February 16th, the service staff started their shift by first studying Chairman Mao's teachings on "not fighting unprepared battles and not fighting battles without confidence," preparing to solve this complex problem properly. That day, there were over 1,500 passengers with tickets transferring from Shijiazhuang to Taiyuan; however, there was only one train from Dezhou to Taiyuan during the day. Could so many passengers board this train? The service staff first contacted the originating station by phone to find out that there were over 800 passengers boarding from Dezhou to Da Zhai, and only 300 could board in Shijiazhuang.

The problem was laid out. The service staff remembered Chairman Mao's teachings and organized a Mao Zedong Thought study class with the passengers. They first had the passengers study Chairman Mao's relevant teachings and then honestly explained the number of trains available that day and how many could depart, hoping everyone would solve the problem according to Mao Zedong Thought. As the waiting passengers discussed, one passenger came up with a group ticket for over 400 people. The service staff thought: according to railway regulations, group tickets have priority. What if this passenger raises this issue? Unexpectedly, the passenger said: "We originally planned to take this train, but after understanding the actual traffic situation, we decided to follow Chairman Mao's teachings on considering the bigger picture and understanding the broader situation. Today, we will send one person to Da Zhai to make arrangements, and the rest will take the evening train." The passenger's words deeply moved the service staff, who said: "You are so serious about studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought in practice. We should learn from you!" The passenger replied: "We are going to Da Zhai to learn. Before arriving at Da Zhai, we have already learned Mao Zedong Thought at your station."

However, the problem was not completely solved. Among the over 1,000 passengers, who should go first? The service staff organized the passengers to study Chairman Mao's teachings on "supporting the army and loving the people," explaining to the passengers the importance of supporting the army and loving the people, and pointing out that the soldiers on missions have important tasks. Before the service staff finished speaking, the passengers unanimously agreed: "Good! Let the soldiers go first." The service staff then said to the passengers: "Those with children and the elderly have difficulties moving around and will face challenges with long waiting times." The passengers said: "They should go first." The soldiers, along with the elderly and those with children, totaling over 300 people, boarded this train. In this way, the relatively complex and difficult traffic problem was smoothly solved through the Mao Zedong Thought study class.

专栏：在毛泽东思想学习班里

    从棘手到顺利
    今年二月份以来，从这里去大寨参观的旅客大量增加，虽然每天加开两趟临时客车，还有许多旅客不能当天走。二月十六日这天，服务员一上班就首先学习了毛主席关于“不打无准备之仗，不打无把握之仗”的教导，准备合理解决这个复杂的问题。当天持有客票从石家庄换车往太原去的旅客，就有一千五百多人；可是白天只有从德州开往太原去的一趟车。能不能搭上这么多旅客呢？服务员事先用电话向始发站了解：从德州上车到大寨去的旅客有八百多人，在石家庄只能上三百人。
    难题摆到了面前。服务员牢记毛主席的教导，和旅客一起办起毛泽东思想学习班。他们首先组织旅客们学习了毛主席的有关教导，又把今天有几趟车、能走多少人的情况，如实地向旅客讲了，希望大家按照毛泽东思想来解决问题。正在候车旅客纷纷议论时，有一个旅客拿着一张四百多人的团体票来找服务员。服务员心里想：按铁路规定，团体票优先走，如果他提出这个问题该怎么解决呢？想不到这个旅客说：“我们原计划这趟车走，可是了解到交通的实际情况后，我们决定按照毛主席关于顾大局、识大体的教导办事，今天先派一个人到大寨去联系，其他人坐晚上客车走。”旅客的话使服务员很受感动，他说：“你们这样认真地活学活用毛泽东思想，我们要向你们学习！”这位旅客说：“我们是去向大寨学习的，没到大寨前就在你们车站先学到了毛泽东思想。”
    可是，问题还没有完全解决，在一千多人中，究竟让谁先走呢？服务员又组织旅客学习了毛主席“拥军爱民”的教导，向旅客宣传拥军爱民的道理，说明解放军同志外出肩负重要任务，……没等服务员说完，旅客们异口同声地表示赞同：“好！让解放军同志先走。”这时服务员又对旅客说：“带小孩的、上年纪的旅客行动不方便，候车时间长了有困难。”旅客们说：“应该让他们先走。”解放军加上年老、带小孩的旅客共三百多人，乘这次车走了。这样，比较复杂、棘手的交通问题，通过办毛泽东思想学习班，就顺利解决了。
