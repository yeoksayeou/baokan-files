Forever Learn from Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants

Khrushchev of China clamors: "Peasants have no culture, they can't see far." He also tells us young intellectuals to "look further ahead... don't be like ordinary peasants." This is a shameless slander against poor and lower-middle peasants, and an attempt to drive a wedge between revolutionary young intellectuals and poor and lower-middle peasants. We will never agree to this!

Great Leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "To study Marxism, one must not only learn from books, but mainly through class struggle, practical work, and getting close to the workers and peasants, can one truly learn it." The thirty-eight young intellectuals from Kàoshān Brigade, following Chairman Mao's teachings, in early 1964, after graduating from junior and senior high school, with revolutionary enthusiasm, carrying the shining works of Chairman Mao, came to the countryside to settle down. Over the years, in the process of integrating with poor and lower-middle peasants, we deeply feel that poor and lower-middle peasants are our best teachers. Their boundless love for Chairman Mao, their socialist awareness of caring for the collective, and their hardworking and simple style are forever our examples to learn from.

In Kàoshān Brigade, we have seen many poor and lower-middle peasants. Although they are illiterate, they can overcome various difficulties to study and apply Chairman Mao's works. Using the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, they launch a great exposure, criticism, and struggle against Khrushchev of China and his agents in this region, and against unrepentant landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists. Whatever Chairman Mao says, they do it. One day, during our rest, we saw an old poor peasant, Zhào Gēngyáng, taking out a notebook from his pocket and writing something seriously. We took a closer look, and although there were no words in the notebook, there were many lines and drawings. Curiously, we asked him why he drew these things. He said: "This is my notes on studying Chairman Mao's works. Since I can't read, I can only use these to help me remember Chairman Mao's teachings. No matter how difficult it is, it can't stop my determination to study Chairman Mao's works!" Then, he angrily denounced the evil old society and fiercely criticized Khrushchev of China. He said: "In that dark world where people eat people, we poor people couldn't even save our lives, let alone go to school! Our ancestors and grandparents worked for the landlords, my grandfather worked to death, my grandmother was forced to remarry, and I started working for the landlords at the age of eight, working for twenty-one years. The landlords never treated us poor people as human beings. Once, a landlord complained that I didn't work hard enough and beat me with a pitchfork until I was half dead. Even now, I still have a scar on my head. It was Chairman Mao who saved us from the sea of suffering. Without Chairman Mao, how could we poor people have today! But Khrushchev of China says that 'exploitation is meritorious' and advocates 'three freedoms and one contract,' 'four freedoms,' wanting us poor people to go back to the old ways. We will fight to the end with all our might!"

Poor and lower-middle peasants love Chairman Mao dearly and hate Khrushchev of China deeply. They study Chairman Mao's works in their spare moments during labor, setting up revolutionary criticism battlefields in the fields. In the evenings, they hold debates, criticism meetings, and struggle meetings, often continuing until late at night.

Poor and lower-middle peasants always take the initiative to do things that benefit the collective, working wholeheartedly, fearing neither dirt nor hardship. One cold winter night, when the collective's old sow was about to give birth, the poor and lower-middle peasant members guarded it eagerly. After the piglets were born, they used their hands to peel off the afterbirth one by one, and some even took off their own clothes to wrap the piglets.

Poor and lower-middle peasants also care about our progress at all times, telling us the village history and family history, guiding us to remember bitterness and not forget our roots; studying Chairman Mao's works with us, helping us to overcome selfishness and establish public spirit, changing our worldview; patiently teaching us production techniques. The progress we thirty-eight young intellectuals have made in a few short years is the result of being nurtured by Mao Zedong Thought, and the result of the enthusiastic help from the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants.

Khrushchev of China's evil purpose in slandering poor and lower-middle peasants is to make us not integrate with poor and lower-middle peasants, to make us detach from proletarian politics, detach from the workers and peasants, detach from production practice, and become "spiritual aristocrats" towering over the working people. This conspiracy will never succeed. We must better study and apply Chairman Mao's works, forever learn from poor and lower-middle peasants!

    永远拜贫下中农为师
    辽宁省开原县威远堡公社靠山大队下乡知识青年　喻国政
    中国赫鲁晓夫叫嚣：“农民没文化，看不远”。他还对我们知识青年胡说什么：“你们应该看远一些，……不要与一般农民一样。”这是对贫下中农的无耻污蔑，挑拨革命知识青年同贫下中农的血肉关系。我们坚决不答应！
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“学习马克思主义，不但要从书本上学，主要地还要通过阶级斗争、工作实践和接近工农群众，才能真正学到。”我们靠山大队的三十八名下乡知识青年，遵照毛主席的教导，在一九六四年初、高中毕业后，满怀革命的壮志豪情，带着金光闪闪的毛主席著作，来到农村安家落户。几年来，我们在同贫下中农相结合的过程中深深地体会到，贫下中农是我们最好的老师。他们那种无限热爱毛主席的赤胆忠心，关心集体的社会主义觉悟，勤劳朴实的作风，永远是我们学习的榜样。
    我们在靠山大队见到许多贫下中农，虽然他们不识字，但是他们能够克服各种困难活学活用毛主席著作，以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，对中国赫鲁晓夫及其在本地区的代理人，对没有改造好的地、富、反、坏、右分子，展开大揭发、大批判、大斗争。毛主席怎么说，他们就怎么做。有一天，我们在休息时看见老贫农赵更阳从兜里掏出笔记本在认真地写什么。我们仔细一看，本子里没有一个字，却有着许多道道和图画。我们好奇地问他为什么画这些东西。他说：“这是我学习毛主席著作的笔记。因为咱不识字，只好用这些帮咱把毛主席的教导记下来。就是再难也难不住咱学习毛主席著作的决心啊！”接着，他愤怒地控诉万恶的旧社会，狠狠地批判中国赫鲁晓夫。他说：“在那人吃人的黑暗世道里，咱穷人连命都保不住，哪里还能念书啊！咱家祖祖辈辈给地主扛活，爷爷活活累死，奶奶被迫改嫁，我也从八岁就开始给地主扛活，一直扛了二十一年。地主根本不拿咱穷人当人。一次地主嫌我干活干少了，用杈子劈头盖脑地把我打个死去活来，至今我头上还留着伤疤。是毛主席他老人家把咱从苦海里救出来的，没有毛主席咱穷人那有今天！可是，中国赫鲁晓夫胡说什么‘剥削有功’，鼓吹‘三自一包’、‘四大自由’，想让咱穷人走回头路。我们豁出老命来也要和他拚到底！”贫下中农无限热爱毛主席，无限仇恨中国赫鲁晓夫。他们在劳动中利用休息的片刻，在地头活学活用毛主席著作，大摆革命大批判的战场。晚上，他们举行辩论会、批判会和斗争会，往往过了半夜还不肯休息。
    贫下中农对有利于集体的事，总是抢着做，实心干，不怕脏，不怕累。在一个寒冬的夜里，队里的老母猪要下崽了，贫下中农社员眼巴巴地守护着。当猪崽生下来以后，他们用手把胎皮一个个地剥下来，有的甚至还脱下自己的衣服把猪崽包起来。
    贫下中农还时时处处关心我们的进步，给我们讲村史、家史，引导我们忆苦思甜不忘本；同我们一起活学活用毛主席著作，帮助我们破私立公，改造世界观；耐心地向我们传授生产技术。我们三十八名下乡知识青年在短短的几年里获得一些进步，都是毛泽东思想哺育的结果，都是广大贫下中农热情帮助的结果。
    中国赫鲁晓夫污蔑贫下中农的罪恶目的，就是要我们不同贫下中农相结合，使我们脱离无产阶级政治、脱离工农群众、脱离生产实践，成为高踞于劳动人民头上的“精神贵族”。这个阴谋是永远不能得逞的。我们一定要更好地活学活用毛主席著作，永远拜贫下中农为师！
