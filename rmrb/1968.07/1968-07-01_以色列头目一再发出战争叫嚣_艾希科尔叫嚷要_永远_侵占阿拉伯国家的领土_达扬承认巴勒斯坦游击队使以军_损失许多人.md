With the support and encouragement of U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism, the Israeli aggressors have recently intensified their mobilization of invasion forces while continuously issuing war threats. They attempt to use the intimidation of launching a new war of aggression to force Arab countries to accept Israel's aggression and acknowledge the Arab territories occupied by Israel during last year's June war.

On the 27th, Israeli Prime Minister Eshkol at a meeting of the ruling Labor Party in Jerusalem raved that Israel must prepare for another war with the Arabs. He said that Israel will never allow the occupied regions to return to their pre-war status; Israel will never relinquish control over the occupied Jerusalem. He also bluntly stated that Israel demands not just the right to pass through the Suez Canal, but the permanent occupation of the Gaza Strip and the West Bank of the Jordan River.

A few days earlier, Eshkol, in an interview with "Israel Broadcasting Station" reporters, had already ranted about making the Jordan River Israel's "security border" until Israel, through "direct negotiations," forces Arab countries to accept a humiliating "peace" plan.

Meanwhile, another Israeli leader, Defense Minister Dayan, also ranted at the Labor Party meeting that Israel must purchase weapons and manufacture them itself, and strengthen its armed forces to prepare for another war with the Arabs.

While issuing war threats, the Israeli aggressors cannot hide their paper tiger nature. Dayan admitted in his speech that the "Fatah" (Palestine Liberation Movement) and other Palestinian guerrilla forces have dealt heavy blows to the Israeli invasion forces over the past year. He said, "Fighting against 'Fatah' has cost us a great deal of effort and many casualties."

It is reported that the Israeli aggressors, in preparation for a new war of aggression, are accelerating the import of weapons and equipment from the United States and other Western countries. After recently handing over forty-eight "Phantom" jet fighters to Israel, the United States has secretly rushed more weapons and equipment to Israel. According to Agence France-Presse, a U.S. cargo ship loaded with four thousand tons of weapons and ammunition left Durban, South Africa, last week and is heading towards an Israeli port. In addition, Israel recently obtained twenty-five "Mirage" jet fighters from France.

    以色列头目一再发出战争叫嚣
    艾希科尔叫嚷要“永远”侵占阿拉伯国家的领土
    达扬承认巴勒斯坦游击队使以军“损失许多人”
    新华社三十日讯　耶路撒冷消息：在美帝苏修的支持和纵容下，以色列侵略者在最近加紧集结侵略军的同时，不断发出战争叫嚣，妄图用发动新的侵略战争的恫吓，来迫使阿拉伯国家接受以色列的侵略，承认以色列在去年六月侵略战争中侵占的阿拉伯领土。
    以色列总理艾希科尔二十七日在耶路撒冷举行的以色列执政党工党的一次会议上疯狂地叫嚷说，以色列必须准备同阿拉伯人进行另一次战争。他说，以色列决不能让它占领的地区恢复到战前的状况；以色列决不会放弃它霸占的耶路撒冷的控制权。他还露骨地说，以色列要的绝不仅是让它的船只通过苏伊士运河的权利，而是要求永远占领加沙地带和约旦河西岸。
    在这以前几天，艾希科尔在接见“以色列广播电台”记者时，就叫嚷过要把约旦河作为以色列的“安全边界”，直到以色列通过“直接谈判”使阿拉伯国家接受丧权辱国的“和平”方案时为止。
    与此同时，以色列的另一头目、国防部长达扬也在工党会议上叫嚷说，以色列必须购买武器，并且自己制造武器，必须加强武装力量，准备同阿拉伯人进行另一次战争。
    以色列侵略者在发出战争叫嚣的同时，无法掩饰他们色厉内荏的纸老虎本质。达扬在谈话中承认，“法塔赫”（巴勒斯坦解放运动）和其它巴勒斯坦游击队一年来给以色列侵略军以沉重打击。他说，“同‘法塔赫’作战，使我们花了很大的力气，损失了许多人。”
    据报道，以色列侵略者为了发动新的侵略战争，正在加快速度从美国和其他西方国家进口武器装备。美国在不久前交给以色列四十八架“鬼怪式”喷气战斗机以后，最近又在秘密赶运武器装备给以色列。据法新社报道，一艘载运四千吨武器弹药的美国货船，在上星期离开南非的德班港，开往一个以色列港口。此外，以色列最近又从法国得到了二十五架“富加马吉斯特”喷气式飞机。
