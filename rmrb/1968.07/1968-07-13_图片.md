The Revolutionary Committee of Xiaosi Ping People's Commune in Dongfeng County, Jilin Province, with the assistance of the agricultural support troops, has led the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants to use Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon. They are deeply and persistently carrying out a revolutionary criticism campaign. This is a scene of the Revolutionary Committee members and commune members criticizing the "three freedoms and one contract" counter-revolutionary revisionist black goods promoted by Chinese Khrushchev during a break in their labor.
