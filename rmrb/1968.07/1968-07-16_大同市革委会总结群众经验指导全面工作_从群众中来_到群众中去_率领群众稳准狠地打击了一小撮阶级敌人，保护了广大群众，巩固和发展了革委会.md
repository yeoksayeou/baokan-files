The Datong Municipal Revolutionary Committee in Shanxi Province, following the great leader Chairman Mao's teaching to "trust and rely on the masses," has carried forward the Party's fine tradition of close ties with the masses. It has implemented the fundamental leadership method of "from the masses, to the masses," leading the masses to steadily, accurately, and resolutely strike down a handful of class enemies. It has protected the broad masses of the people, consolidated and developed the new revolutionary committee.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Datong, July 14—The Datong Municipal Revolutionary Committee, after its establishment, studied Chairman Mao's great teaching: "As long as we rely on the people, firmly believe that the creative power of the masses is boundless, and thus trust the people and unite with them, then any difficulty can be overcome, and any enemy can be defeated by us, rather than defeating us." Based on Chairman Mao's teachings, they led the revolutionary masses to launch a revolutionary criticism against China's Khrushchev and his local agents. In the practice of revolutionary struggle, the members of the revolutionary committee further realized: the counter-revolutionary revisionist line pushed by a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party is to create a separation between the Party and the masses, and between the proletarian dictatorship and the masses, aiming to restore capitalism. After the establishment of the revolutionary committee, the class enemies, unwilling to accept their failure, were constantly looking for opportunities to sabotage. Faced with the sharp and complex class struggle, the revolutionary committee could only maintain close ties with the masses to timely grasp the new moves of the class enemies. Only by firmly relying on the masses could they launch a proactive attack on the class enemies. Therefore, they regarded maintaining close ties with the masses and never leaving the masses as an important guarantee for consolidating the new revolutionary committee, consolidating the proletarian dictatorship, and developing the good situation of the Cultural Revolution.

Under this guidance, the Datong Municipal Revolutionary Committee, in implementing Chairman Mao's latest instruction that "the most fundamental principle in the reform of state organs is to connect with the masses," formulated specific measures to maintain close ties with the masses. The main measures are: (1) After the publication of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, the main leaders of the revolutionary committee should promptly go to factories, mines, and enterprises to personally explain and study them with the workers. (2) Actively participate in socialist labor. The main leaders of the revolutionary committee regularly go to coal mines, machine factories, and other grassroots units to work. (3) The main leaders of the revolutionary committee should personally receive visiting masses. For letters from the masses, they should strive to reply to each one and follow up on each matter. (4) The main leaders of the revolutionary committee should personally conduct investigations and research among the masses to obtain firsthand materials. (5) The revolutionary mass representatives in the revolutionary committee should insist on returning to their units to work and listen to the opinions of the masses.

The leaders of the Datong Municipal Revolutionary Committee deeply felt in their extensive contact with the masses that Chairman Mao's teaching that "in a certain sense, the most intelligent and most talented are the soldiers with the most practical experience" is a great truth. They said: We, being above, have less practical experience than the masses. Our responsibility is to pass on Mao Zedong Thought to the masses, and the masses will come up with various methods. Then, by summarizing the masses' creations and promoting them, an endless force will be generated. They seriously implemented Chairman Mao's instruction to "concentrate from the masses and go back to the masses to form the correct leadership opinion," continuously summarizing new creations and experiences from the masses, correctly guiding the revolutionary mass movement, and making various works unprecedentedly active.

At one time, a handful of class enemies stirred up a wind of reversing verdicts, disrupting the direction of the struggle, and affecting the progress of the revolutionary criticism. How to carry out the revolutionary criticism in a sustained and in-depth manner was a new problem faced by the revolutionary committee. After they put this problem to the masses, the leader of the revolutionary mass organization of the Shanxi Diesel Engine Factory actively reported their factory's experience in revolutionary criticism to the municipal revolutionary committee. The municipal revolutionary committee immediately went to the factory to investigate and summarize, held an on-site meeting, and quickly turned the factory's experience into the common wealth of the revolutionary masses throughout the city, making the revolutionary criticism in the entire city reach a new high, smashing the class enemies' wind of reversing verdicts, defending the great achievements of the Cultural Revolution, and raising the class struggle and line struggle consciousness of the broad masses.

Chairman Mao taught us: "Whether to protect or suppress the broad masses of the people is the fundamental difference between the Communist Party and the Kuomintang, the fundamental difference between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, and the fundamental difference between the proletarian dictatorship and the bourgeois dictatorship." The Datong Municipal Revolutionary Committee, following Chairman Mao's great teaching, has always insisted on mobilizing the masses, firmly relying on the masses, correctly distinguishing between the two types of contradictions, uniting all revolutionary forces that can be united, and steadily, accurately, and resolutely striking down a handful of class enemies. They organized those who made mistakes to participate in Mao Zedong Thought study classes, study Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, and help them raise their consciousness of the two-line struggle. As a result, those who made mistakes quickly awakened, turned against the enemy, and exposed one by one those who plotted behind the scenes to engage in splittist activities or infiltrated into mass organizations to incite the masses against the revolutionary committee, such as traitors, spies, and unrepentant capitalist roaders. This not only dealt a heavy blow to the enemy but also educated and united the vast majority of the masses.

    大同市革委会总结群众经验指导全面工作
    从群众中来  到群众中去
    率领群众稳准狠地打击了一小撮阶级敌人，保护了广大群众，巩固和发展了革委会
    据新华社太原十四日电 山西省大同市革命委员会遵照伟大领袖毛主席“相信和依靠群众”的教导，发扬党的密切联系群众的优良作风，贯彻“从群众中来，到群众中去”的基本领导方法，率领群众稳、准、狠地打击一小撮阶级敌人，保护了广大人民群众，巩固和发展了新生的革命委员会。
    大同市革命委员会诞生以后，学习了毛主席的伟大教导：“只要我们依靠人民，坚决地相信人民群众的创造力是无穷无尽的，因而信任人民，和人民打成一片，那就任何困难也能克服，任何敌人也不能压倒我们，而只会被我们所压倒。”他们根据毛主席的教导，带领广大革命群众，向中国赫鲁晓夫及其在当地的代理人展开了革命大批判。在革命斗争的实践中，革委会成员进一步认识到：党内一小撮走资派推行的反革命修正主义路线，就是要制造党和群众的分离，制造无产阶级政权和群众的分离，复辟资本主义。革命委员会成立以后，阶级敌人不甘心于他们的失败，时刻在窥测方向，阴谋进行破坏。面对着尖锐复杂的阶级斗争，革命委员会只有密切联系群众，才能及时地掌握阶级敌人的新动向，只有坚决依靠群众，才能主动地向阶级敌人发起进攻。因此，他们把密切联系群众，一刻也不脱离群众，当作巩固新生的革命委员会，巩固无产阶级专政，发展文化大革命的大好形势的重要保证。
    在这种思想指导下，大同市革命委员会在落实毛主席“国家机关的改革，最根本的一条，就是联系群众”的最新指示中，制定了密切联系群众的具体措施。主要的是：（一）毛主席的最新指示发表以后，革委会主要领导成员要随时到厂矿、企业亲自宣讲，和工人群众一起活学活用。（二）积极参加社会主义生产劳动，革委会主要负责人定期到煤矿、机械厂等基层单位参加劳动。（三）革委会主要领导成员要亲自出面接见来访的群众。对群众来信，尽量做到件件有答复，事事有着落。（四）革委会主要负责人要亲自到群众中进行调查研究，掌握第一手材料。（五）革命委员会中的革命群众代表，要坚持回本单位参加劳动，倾听群众的意见。
    大同市革命委员会的领导成员在同群众广泛联系中深刻体会到，毛主席的“在某种意义上来说，最聪明、最有才能的，是最有实践经验的战士”的教导是伟大的真理。他们说：我们在上面，实践经验比群众少。我们的责任是把毛泽东思想交给群众，群众就会想出各种各样的办法来，然后再把群众的创造总结起来，推广下去，就会产生无穷无尽的力量。他们认真贯彻执行毛主席的“从群众中集中起来又到群众中坚持下去，以形成正确的领导意见”的指示，不断总结群众中的新创造、新经验，正确地引导革命的群众运动，使各项工作空前活跃。
    有一个时期，一小撮阶级敌人刮起翻案妖风，干扰了斗争大方向，影响了革命大批判的进行。如何把革命大批判持久深入地开展下去，这是革命委员会遇到的一个新问题。他们把这个问题交给群众以后，山西柴油机厂群众组织负责人就主动向市革命委员会反映他们厂革命大批判的经验。市革委会立即到这个厂调查总结，开现场会，很快把这个厂的经验变为全市革命群众的财富，使全市的革命大批判又掀起了一个新高潮，粉碎了阶级敌人的翻案妖风，保卫了无产阶级文化大革命的伟大成果，提高了广大群众的阶级斗争和路线斗争觉悟。
    毛主席教导我们：“对广大人民群众是保护还是镇压，是共产党同国民党的根本区别，是无产阶级同资产阶级的根本区别，是无产阶级专政同资产阶级专政的根本区别。”大同市革命委员会遵照毛主席这一伟大教导，始终坚持放手发动群众，坚决依靠群众，正确区分两类不同性质的矛盾，团结一切可以团结的革命力量，稳、准、狠地打击了一小撮阶级敌人。他们对于犯错误的群众坚持组织他们参加毛泽东思想学习班，学习毛主席的一系列最新指示，帮助他们提高两条路线斗争的觉悟。这样做的结果，使犯错误的群众迅速觉醒过来，反戈一击，把那些在幕后策划搞分裂活动，或者钻到群众组织中煽动群众反对革命委员会的叛徒、特务、顽固不化的走资派一个一个揭露出来，既沉重地打击了敌人，又教育和团结了绝大多数群众。
