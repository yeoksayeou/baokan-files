The Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam held an enlarged meeting from July 11 to 13 under the chairmanship of Chairman Nguyen Huu Tho. The meeting reviewed the combat situation in South Vietnam since the New Year and determined the current tasks and stance of the National Liberation Front. The meeting called on the military and people of South Vietnam to advance courageously and achieve greater victories in the struggle against American aggression for national salvation.

During the meeting, Chairman Nguyen Huu Tho delivered a report titled "The Overall Situation and Our Current Tasks." Vice Chairman and Chief of the Military Committee of the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front, Nguyen Van Thieu, reported on the military situation in various battlefields since the New Year. Vice Chairman Pham Ngoc Thao reported on the overall political situation in South Vietnam.

The meeting unanimously agreed that since the New Year, the military and people of South Vietnam have achieved comprehensive strategic victories, delivering a thunderous blow to the American puppet forces, pushing the liberation war into the enemy's headquarters, annihilating and disintegrating a large number of the enemy's combat forces, destroying a large number of the enemy's war tools and material-technical foundations, and liberating vast areas. Under the heavy blows of the people's liberation armed forces, the puppet army has disintegrated in large numbers, and various levels of puppet governments have collapsed one after another, with internal contradictions among the enemy becoming increasingly acute.

The military and political strength of the South Vietnamese people has rapidly grown. Many liberated areas have established people's revolutionary governments. The political program of the National Liberation Front and the policy of national unity to resist American aggression and save the country have already and are continuing to produce profound and extensive effects.

The comprehensive strategic victory of the South Vietnamese people has created a new strategic situation that is very favorable to the people of South Vietnam and various people's liberation armed forces, causing the American aggressors and their lackeys to fall into a passive defensive predicament, becoming increasingly weak and failing, and inevitably suffering a complete defeat. While the South Vietnamese people are in an increasingly solid advantageous position, they have increasingly powerful strength and sufficient ability and conditions to advance more bravely, achieve even greater new victories, and ultimately achieve final victory.

The meeting noted that at present, American imperialism is suffering a great defeat and is in an increasingly desperate and hopeless situation, but it remains extremely stubborn and cunning, talking about peace while continuing to escalate the war of aggression. The meeting pointed out that American imperialism's desperate struggles can only lead to even more disastrous defeats. Nothing can stop the South Vietnamese military and people from launching continuous attacks and increasingly fierce struggles to thoroughly defeat American imperialism's war of aggression, overthrow the puppet government, and seize all power for the people.

The meeting discussed the current tasks of the South Vietnamese military and people, and decided on various proposals and measures aimed at mobilizing the entire military and people to make continuous and fierce attacks and struggles, achieve even greater victories, and ultimately achieve complete victory.

    越南南方民族解放阵线中央主席团举行扩大会议
    号召军民奋勇前进夺取抗美救国斗争更大胜利
    新华社河内二十二日电　据越南南方解放通讯社报道：越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会主席团七月十一日到十三日在阮友寿主席的主持下举行扩大会议，检查了越南南方从新春以来的战斗情况，并且确定了民族解放阵线当前的工作任务和主张，会议号召越南南方军民奋勇前进，夺取抗美救国斗争的最后胜利。
    会议期间，阮友寿主席作了《总形势和我们当前的任务》的报告。民族解放阵线中央委员会主席团副主席兼军事委员会主任陈南忠，介绍了从新春以来各个战场上的军事情况。民族解放阵线中央委员会主席团副主席冯文宫介绍了越南南方总的政治情况。
    会议一致认为：从今年新春以来，越南南方军民取得了全面的战略胜利，给美伪集团以雷霆般的打击，把解放战争推进到敌人的首脑中心，消灭和瓦解敌人大量的有生力量，摧毁敌人大量的战争工具和物质技术基础，解放了广大的地区。在人民解放武装力量沉重打击下，伪军大量瓦解，各级伪政权纷纷垮台，敌人内部矛盾日益加剧。
    南方军民的军事和政治力量迅速壮大。许多解放区已经成立了人民的革命政权。民族解放阵线的政治纲领和全民团结抗美救国的政策，已经和正在日益产生深广的作用。
    南方军民的全面战略胜利，形成了对南方人民和各种人民解放武装力量十分有利的新的战略局面，使美国侵略强盗及其走狗深深地陷入了被动防御困境，日益衰弱、失败，并且必定遭到彻底失败。而南方军民处于日益稳固的优势，具有日益强大的力量，有足够的能力和条件更加勇猛地前进，夺取更加巨大的新胜利，进而夺取最后胜利。
    会议认为，目前，美帝国主义正在遭到大败，陷入了无法挽救的日益走投无路的困境，但它仍然非常顽固和狡猾，它嘴里说和平，而行动上则继续加强侵略战争。会议指出，美帝国主义的疯狂挣扎，只能使它遭到更加惨重的失败。任何东西也阻挠不了南方军民为彻底打败美帝国主义的侵略战争，推翻走狗伪政权，把全部政权夺到人民手里而发动的连续进攻和日益猛烈的奋起斗争。
    会议讨论了南方军民的当前任务，决定了旨在动员全民全军努力地冲上前去，连续猛烈进攻和奋起斗争，夺取更加巨大的胜利进而夺取彻底胜利的各项主张和措施。
