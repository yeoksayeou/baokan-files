Tokyo (New China News Agency) — Japanese revolutionary people have an infinite love for the great leader Chairman Mao. With the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as their weapon, they are waging a heroic struggle against the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries and the revisionist clique of the Japanese Communist Party led by Kiyoshi Miyamoto.

In Tokyo, there is a revolutionary youth named Watanabe. Inspired by the great Mao Zedong Thought, he actively participates in the Japanese people's anti-imperialist and anti-revisionist struggle and has grown rapidly in the process. He bravely joined the Japanese people's struggle against the U.S. military hospital in Rinko, the struggle against the construction of the "New Tokyo International Airport" in Sanrizuka by the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries, and the struggle against the Sato government's transportation of jet fuel for the U.S. military.

In the struggle, Watanabe deeply realized that Mao Zedong Thought is the highest level of Marxism-Leninism in contemporary times. He said, "The Japanese people must rely on Mao Zedong Thought to achieve liberation. As long as the Japanese people grasp Mao Zedong Thought and engage in struggle, Japan will definitely be liberated."

Watanabe has an infinite love for the great leader Chairman Mao. In his narrow and simple room, he has hung twelve portraits of Chairman Mao. On the red cover of the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" that he carries with him every day, he has also pasted a color photograph of Chairman Mao.

A revolutionary youth named Ohashi uses Mao Zedong Thought as his weapon to fight against the revisionist clique of the Japanese Communist Party led by Kiyoshi Miyamoto. He takes Mao Zedong Thought as his guide to action. Whenever he encounters problems in the struggle, he consults the works of Chairman Mao. He not only studies Mao Zedong Thought seriously but also organizes other youths to study together and participate in the struggle together.

Through the study of Chairman Mao's works, Ohashi deeply understands that for intellectuals, the most important thing is to combine theory with practice. Recently, Ohashi has been diligently studying Chairman Mao's brilliant work "The Direction of the Youth Movement" and, following Chairman Mao's teachings, often goes deep into the countryside to live, work, and struggle with the peasants.

In the great patriotic struggle against U.S. imperialism launched by the Japanese people, Ohashi has seen through the traitorous face of the revisionist clique of the Japanese Communist Party led by Kiyoshi Miyamoto. He angrily denounced, "The revisionist clique of the Japanese Communist Party led by Kiyoshi Miyamoto does not revolutionize itself and does not allow others to revolutionize. It wants the youth to become cowards and deserters."

Ohashi said passionately, "It is the great Mao Zedong Thought that has shown us the direction of struggle and given us boundless courage. Under the great thought of Chairman Mao on daring to struggle and daring to win, I dare to wage an unyielding struggle against the enemy. Once, in a struggle, I was illegally arrested by the Japanese reactionary police, but I was fearless. At that time, I firmly remembered Chairman Mao's great teaching, 'All the people of the world, unite! All the people of the world, fight! Down with U.S. imperialism! Down with all reactionaries!' and fought resolutely with the enemy."

Ohashi said, "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao has given us great encouragement. China has become a powerful base for world revolution. We wish Chairman Mao eternal life!"

A surgeon named Shiraki enthusiastically praises Chairman Mao as not only the great leader of the Chinese people but also the great leader of the revolutionary people of the world. In Shiraki's home, there is a photograph of Chairman Mao in military uniform waving to the Red Guards. Recently, he had someone bring back a large color portrait of Chairman Mao from China. Usually, he hangs this portrait of Chairman Mao at home and gazes at it every day; whenever he participates in a struggle, he holds up this portrait of Chairman Mao to the struggle site to inspire people's fighting spirit.

After Chairman Mao's great statement supporting the struggle of American blacks against violence was issued, he was very moved. He realized that Chairman Mao's statement not only pointed out the road to victory for the struggle of American blacks but also showed the Japanese people the direction of struggle. He actively propagandized Chairman Mao's great statement to the Japanese people. One day, a mass rally was held in Kokura City, Kitakyushu, to protest against the atrocities of the U.S. military. Shiraki, in his speech at the rally, recited the entire text of Chairman Mao's great statement. Another time, he heard that the doctors in Kyushu were going to hold a meeting. He personally carved Chairman Mao's great statement into a wax block and printed it before the meeting to distribute at the venue, which was warmly received.

Shiraki seriously reads Chairman Mao's works. He has read Chairman Mao's brilliant works "Investigation of the Peasant Movement in Hunan," "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship," "On Practice," "On Contradiction," and "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" many times. He said, holding the newly published Japanese translation of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong," "This is the most powerful weapon for the Japanese people to carry out the revolution."

Although Shiraki is over fifty years old, he always participates in the Japanese people's anti-U.S. patriotic struggle with full revolutionary enthusiasm. Not long ago, in the struggle of the Japanese people in Kokura City, Kitakyushu, against the U.S. military ammunition depot in Yamada, and in the struggle in the Fukuoka Banpaku base against the crash of a U.S. military aircraft into Kyushu University, burning down the school buildings, Shiraki joined the young students, fearlessly facing the savage suppression of the fully armed police, and conducted a militant demonstration march. In front of the crowd, he strongly denounced the heinous crimes of U.S. imperialism using its military bases in Japan to expand the Vietnam War and exposed and condemned the shameful role of the revisionist clique of the Japanese Communist Party led by Kiyoshi Miyamoto as the accomplice of the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries.

When Shiraki participates in the struggle, he always wears a "Red Cross" armband, participating in the struggle while rescuing the demonstrators injured by the Japanese police. He said excitedly, "I want to serve the people wholeheartedly. I want to learn from Norman Bethune."

    毛泽东思想给日本人民指明斗争的方向胜利的道路
    日本革命人民以毛泽东思想为武器同美日反动派和宫本集团展开英勇斗争
    新华社讯　东京消息：日本革命人民无限热爱伟大领袖毛主席，他们以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，同美日反动派和日共宫本修正主义集团展开了英勇的斗争。
    东京有一位叫作渡边的革命青年，在伟大的毛泽东思想鼓舞下，积极参加日本人民的反帝反修斗争，并且在斗争中迅速地成长起来。他勇敢地参加了日本人民反对美军王子野战医院的斗争、反对美日反动派在三里塚修建“新东京国际机场”的斗争以及反对佐藤政府为美军运输喷气式飞机燃料的斗争。
    在斗争中，渡边深刻地认识到毛泽东思想是当代最高水平的马克思列宁主义。他说：“日本人民要取得解放，必须依靠毛泽东思想。”“只要日本人民掌握毛泽东思想进行斗争，日本就一定会获得解放。”
    渡边无限热爱伟大领袖毛主席。他在自己的一间狭窄而又简陋的房间里，张贴了十二张毛主席像。他在每天随身携带的《毛主席语录》的红色封面上，也贴了一张毛主席的彩色照片。
    一位叫大桥的革命青年，以毛泽东思想为武器，同日共宫本修正主义集团进行斗争。他把毛泽东思想作为行动的指南。每当在斗争中遇到问题，他都请教毛主席著作。他不仅自己认真学习毛泽东思想，而且还组织其他青年一道进行学习，一道参加斗争。
    大桥通过毛主席著作的学习，深切地认识到，对于知识分子来说，最重要的是理论联系实际。最近，大桥正在努力学习毛主席的光辉著作《青年运动的方向》，并且遵照毛主席的教导，经常深入农村，与农民同吃、同住、同劳动、同斗争。
    在日本人民掀起的伟大的反美爱国正义斗争中，大桥认清了日共宫本修正主义集团的叛徒嘴脸。他愤怒地控诉说，日共宫本修正主义集团自己不革命，也不准许别人革命，要青年们都变成胆小鬼和怕死鬼。
    大桥满怀激情地说，是伟大的毛泽东思想给我们指出了斗争方向，并给予我们无限勇气。他在毛主席关于敢于斗争、敢于胜利的伟大思想鼓舞下，敢于同敌人展开不屈不挠的斗争。他在一次斗争中遭到日本反动警察的非法逮捕，但是他面无惧色。当时，他牢记毛主席“全世界人民团结起来，打败美国侵略者及其一切走狗！全世界人民要有勇气，敢于战斗，不怕困难，前赴后继，那末，全世界就一定是人民的。一切魔鬼通通都会被消灭”的伟大教导，同敌人进行了坚决的斗争。
    大桥说：“毛主席亲自发动和领导的中国无产阶级文化大革命给我们以巨大的鼓舞。中国已经成为世界革命的强大的根据地。我们敬祝毛主席万寿无疆！”
    一位叫白井的外科医生，热情赞扬毛主席不仅是中国人民的伟大领袖，而且是全世界革命人民的伟大领袖。白井家里挂着一幅毛主席身穿军装向红卫兵招手致意的照片。最近，他又托人从中国带回一张毛主席的巨幅彩色画像。平时他把这幅毛主席画像挂在家里，天天仰望；每当参加斗争时，就举着这幅毛主席像到斗争现场，鼓舞人们的战斗意志。
    毛主席支持美国黑人抗暴斗争的伟大声明发表后，他很激动。他认识到，毛主席的声明，不仅给美国黑人的斗争指出了胜利的道路，也给日本人民指明了斗争方向。他积极地向日本人民广泛地宣传毛主席的这一伟大声明。有一天，北九州市的小仓举行抗议美军暴行的群众集会。白井在大会上讲话时，朗诵了毛主席的这一伟大声明的全文。还有一次，他听说九州的医生们要举行一次会议。他便在会前亲自动手把毛主席的伟大声明刻成腊版，印好后到会场上散发，受到了热烈欢迎。
    白井认真阅读毛主席著作。毛主席的《湖南农民运动考察报告》、《论人民民主专政》、《实践论》、《矛盾论》和《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》等光辉著作，他已经反复地阅读了好多遍。他拿着最近出版的《毛泽东选集》日文版新译本说：“这是我们日本人民进行革命的最强有力的武器。”
    白井虽然五十多岁了，但是，他总是以饱满的革命热情参加日本人民的反美爱国斗争。不久前，在北九州市小仓展开的日本人民反对美军山田军火库的斗争中，在福冈板付基地展开的抗议美国军用飞机坠落九州大学、焚毁校舍的斗争中，白井同青年学生们一道，不怕全副武装警察的野蛮镇压，进行充满战斗性的示威游行。他在群众面前，强烈控诉美帝国主义利用它在日本的军事基地扩大侵越战争的滔天罪行，并且揭露和痛斥日共宫本修正主义集团充当美日反动派的可耻帮凶。
    白井参加斗争时，总是戴上一个“红十字”袖章，一面参加斗争，一面救护被日本警察打伤的示威群众。他激动地说：“我要全心全意为人民服务，我要向白求恩学习。”
