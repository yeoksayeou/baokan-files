The Yutian County Revolutionary Committee of Hebei Province follows the great teachings of Chairman Mao and strives for the revolutionization of the leading cadres and implements streamlining and efficiency.

With the assistance of the People's Liberation Army's leftist support personnel, the Revolutionary Committee bravely broke out of the old organizational framework, eliminated the cumbersome procedures and mutual obstruction of layers; merged departments with similar functions; reduced the number of full-time personnel and strengthened the front lines.

The following is a report from our newspaper: The red sun illuminates the foothills of the Yanshan Mountains, and the Revolutionary Committee of Yutian County, Hebei Province, which has undergone streamlining and efficiency, is particularly full of vitality. Thirty-eight workers form an infinitely loyal battle command to the great teacher Chairman Mao, closely linked with the masses.

They hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and unwaveringly follow the path of emphasizing proletarian politics. In addition to leaving some personnel to maintain daily work, the main leaders and most of the staff of the Revolutionary Committee have walked out of the office and gone to the front lines of the grassroots, enthusiastically helping the grassroots to carry out the mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, deeply and persistently carrying out revolutionary criticism and struggle, and actively launching a fierce attack on the class enemies. Wherever they go, Mao Zedong Thought study classes bloom like red flowers, the flames of revolutionary criticism burn more fiercely, the mass movement to learn from Dazhai goes deeper, and production is booming. Revolutionary cadres and poor and lower-middle peasants are all excited to say: "The old stalls are broken, and the new revolutionary style is on, the Revolutionary Committee is so satisfying, all thanks to Chairman Mao's leadership!"

The key lies in the revolutionization of the leading cadres' thinking

In April of last year, when the Yutian County Revolutionary Committee was established, the "stalls" were set up quite large, basically inheriting the organizational structure of the old county committee and the old people's committee. Therefore, the broad revolutionary cadres and revolutionary masses of the county continuously raised criticisms and strongly demanded thorough reform. The county Revolutionary Committee had also decided three times to implement streamlining and efficiency, but all failed. During a county-wide meeting in March of this year, the county-level organs, commune Revolutionary Committees, and some brigade revolutionary leading cadres who attended the meeting again raised sharp criticisms of the organizational structure of the county Revolutionary Committee: "New name, old organization; new members, old ways." "If the organization is not streamlined and the style is not changed, the thinking will change, and the path will go astray." The leading members of the county Revolutionary Committee were greatly shocked. The members of the People's Liberation Army's leftist support group in Yutian County also took the criticisms of the masses as criticisms of themselves. The members of the Revolutionary Committee and the support group deeply realized that the key to streamlining and efficiency lies in the revolutionization of the leading cadres' thinking. They together carefully studied Chairman Mao's relevant teachings and relevant comments in central newspapers and magazines, deeply understood the great significance of streamlining and efficiency. After repeated study and discussion, the members of the Revolutionary Committee realized that after the revolutionary cadres of the proletariat took power, whether to inherit the bureaucratic old organization that is detached from the masses or to implement streamlining and efficiency and closely link with the masses is a very important issue related to consolidating and developing the great achievements of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in terms of organization.

"Streamlining and efficiency, organizing a revolutionary and mass-linked leading cadre group," this is a new battle cry issued by the great leader Chairman Mao in the new situation where the revolutionary "three-in-one combination" has been achieved. All revolutionary cadres of the proletariat who are determined to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end must implement this without the slightest deviation. The reason why the Revolutionary Committee's three attempts at streamlining and efficiency failed was essentially a problem with the attitude towards the masses. At that time, some people were worried that the Revolutionary Committee had just been established, and if the mass movement to reform the old organization was launched, it would be chaotic, affecting production and work. Therefore, they did not dare to mobilize the masses and always hesitated to take the first step. This time, everyone studied Chairman Mao's teachings on the mass line and realized that believing in oneself or believing in the masses is a reflection of the two diametrically opposed worldviews of the bourgeoisie and the proletariat. On the issue of "streamlining and efficiency," believing in oneself can only result in patching up and following the path of reformism; only by believing in the masses can the old organization be thoroughly reformed and organizational revolutionization be achieved.

Once everyone's thinking was clear, they took immediate action. That day, the county Revolutionary Committee held a standing committee meeting and proposed specific measures for streamlining and efficiency. The next day, they held an expanded meeting of the Revolutionary Committee and decided, in accordance with Chairman Mao's instruction "to hold study classes, which is a good method, and many problems can be solved in study classes," to hold a study class of Mao Zedong Thought for county-level organ workers, using Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to mobilize and rely on the masses to solve the problem of the county Revolutionary Committee implementing "streamlining and efficiency."

Relying on the masses to break through thoroughly and establish firmly

County-level organ workers had various active thoughts on "streamlining and efficiency." In summary, it was that they did not understand that implementing streamlining and efficiency is a sharp and profound class struggle. The new revolutionary organization and the old ideas and styles of the exploiting class have sharp contradictions. Only by fiercely criticizing the counter-revolutionary revisionist line that China's Khrushchev promoted in the construction of political power, thoroughly breaking the old ideas and styles, can a new revolutionary organization be established on a new ideological foundation, and a new revolutionary style be firmly established. Therefore, as soon as the study class began, some comrades could not calm down and sit still. They said, "Whether to criticize or not, it's still a matter of going or staying." The Revolutionary Committee and the support group comrades, in response to these active thoughts, guided the entire study class to first fiercely criticize the counter-revolutionary revisionist line that China's Khrushchev promoted in the construction of political power.

During the period of fierce criticism, the county Revolutionary Committee also printed materials exposing the harm of the old bureaucratic organization that is detached from the masses and distributed them throughout the county, mobilizing the broad masses of the people and the study class members to work together, both inside and outside, to carry out criticism. After the criticism, some who previously had a vague understanding of "streamlining and efficiency" deeply felt, "If you don't criticize, you don't know; if you criticize, you're shocked. If you don't criticize and overthrow China's Khrushchev's counter-revolutionary revisionist line, it will be difficult to safeguard the socialist homeland!"

As the revolutionary criticism deepened, a small handful of class enemies saw that their dream of restoring capitalism was about to completely shatter, so they either openly or secretly launched vicious attacks on "streamlining and efficiency." Everyone firmly remembered Chairman Mao's teaching, "Never forget class struggle," and carried out revolutionary criticism more deeply, smashing the class enemies' sabotage plots.

The members of the Revolutionary Committee deeply understood that the broad revolutionary cadres and revolutionary masses are the direct victims of the old organization and old rules and regulations, and are the commanders and fighters on the front lines of revolution and production. They know best what to break and what to establish. They have the desire and specific plans for reform. Therefore, it is necessary to mobilize them to break and rely on them to establish. Thus, the county organized a "three-in-one combination" small group consisting of the main responsible cadres of the Revolutionary Committee, representatives of the revolutionary masses, and representatives of the People's Liberation Army, to go to the masses, study together, discuss together, think of ways together, and propose plans together. They gathered the wisdom of the masses and then took the plans to the masses for extensive consultation, organized everyone to discuss in groups, compare and modify repeatedly, and finally formed a plan for the Revolutionary Committee to streamline and efficiency. This plan breaks through the key points of detachment from the masses and establishes the fundamental connection with the masses. It eliminated the cumbersome procedures and mutual obstruction of layers; merged departments with similar functions; greatly reduced the number of full-time personnel and strengthened the front lines of revolution and production.

Deeply carry out mass ideological mutual assistance activities

Thoroughly reforming the old organization and establishing a proletarian revolutionary new organization is not only a great organizational revolution but also a great ideological revolution of the masses. In this revolution, the struggle between new and old, public and private, will inevitably continue to emerge. At the beginning of the study class, some comrades thought that how to break and how to establish had already been arranged by the leadership, so they were not very concerned about the great breaking and establishing, and were eager for the leadership to reveal the plan. This phenomenon reflected the shortcomings of the county Revolutionary Committee in not fully following the mass line in the previous stage of work. After the members of the county Revolutionary Committee realized this, they immediately took the initiative to go to the masses to make self-criticisms and have heart-to-heart talks with the masses, exchanging opinions. This made everyone realize that streamlining and efficiency is not just a matter of going or staying for a few people, but a great ideological revolution of the masses, a great matter of the people, and a great matter of consolidating the proletarian dictatorship. It is futile to rely on a few leaders to be busy. The members of the Revolutionary Committee also patiently inspired the masses to be the masters in streamlining and efficiency, to come up with ideas, and to think of ways. In this way, mass ideological mutual assistance activities quickly unfolded in the study class.

Streamlining and efficiency involves the issue of the going and staying of personnel, which is a fierce struggle between public and private, touching the soul of each individual. The comrades participating in the study class, with "fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism" as the guideline and Zhang Tiede and Norman Bethune as mirrors, extensively carried out heart-to-heart talks, sweeping the bourgeois "self" out the door, and letting the proletarian "public" settle down, ensuring the smooth progress of the streamlining and efficiency work.

    河北省玉田县革委会遵循毛主席的伟大教导
    狠抓领导班子革命化，实行精兵简政
    在解放军支左人员的帮助下，革委会勇敢地跳出了旧机构的圈子，破除了手续繁多、互相扯皮的层次；合并了业务相似的部门；压缩脱产人员，加强了第一线
    本报讯　红太阳照亮了燕山之麓，经过精兵简政的河北省玉田县革命委员会，格外显得朝气蓬勃。三十八名工作人员组成了一个无限忠于伟大导师毛主席、密切联系群众的战斗指挥部。
    他们高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚定不移地走突出无产阶级政治的道路。革委会除留下部分人员坚持日常工作外，主要领导成员和机关的大部分工作人员，走出办公室，走上基层第一线，热情帮助基层开展活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动，深入持久地开展革命大批判，主动向阶级敌人展开猛烈进攻。在他们走过的地方，毛泽东思想学习班如红花满地，革命大批判的烈火越烧越旺，学大寨的群众运动更加深入，生产搞得热气腾腾。广大革命干部和贫下中农都激动地说：“打破了旧摊摊，换上了革命新作风，革命委员会这样称心，都是毛主席领导得好！”
      关键在于领导班子的思想革命化
    玉田县革命委员会去年四月份一成立，“摊子”就铺得较大，基本沿袭了旧县委、旧人委的组织机构。因此，全县广大的革命干部和革命群众，不断提出批评，并强烈要求彻底进行改革。县革命委员会也曾三次下决心实行精兵简政，但都没有结果。在今年三月份的一次全县性会议期间，到会的县直机关、公社革委会和部分大队革命领导班子的成员，对县革委会的组织机构，又一次提出了尖锐的批评：“新名称，老机构；新成员，老一套”；“机构再不简，作风再不改，思想就要变，路子准要歪。”县革委会领导成员听了震动很大。驻玉田县解放军支左小组成员也把群众的批评，当作对自己的批评。革委会成员和支左小组同志也深刻认识到：精兵简政的关键在于领导班子的思想革命化。他们一起认真学习毛主席的有关教导和中央报刊上的有关评论，深刻领会关于精兵简政的伟大意义。经过反复学习、反复讨论，革委会成员认识到，无产阶级革命派掌权以后，是沿袭脱离群众的官僚主义旧机构，还是实行精兵简政，密切联系群众，这是关系到从组织上巩固和发展无产阶级文化大革命的伟大成果的极为重要的问题。
      “精兵简政，组织起一个革命化的联系群众的领导班子”，这是在实现了革命“三结合”的新形势下，伟大领袖毛主席发出的新的战斗号令。一切“决心把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底的无产阶级革命派”，都必须不折不扣地贯彻执行。过去革委会三次精兵简政没有结果的原因，实质上是对待群众的态度有问题。当时部分人担心，革命委员会刚刚成立，群众性改革旧机构运动一旦起来，会乱了套，影响生产和工作。因此，不敢发动群众，始终迈不开步子。这次大家学习了毛主席关于群众路线的教导，大家认识到：相信自己还是相信群众，这是资产阶级和无产阶级两种世界观截然不同的反映。对待“精兵简政”这个问题，相信自己，只能是修修补补，走改良主义的道路；只有相信群众，才能彻底改革旧机构，实现组织革命化。
    大家思想通了，马上行动。当天，县革委会就召开了常委会议，提出精兵简政的具体措施。第二天又召开了革委会扩大会议，决定遵照毛主席“办学习班，是个好办法，很多问题可以在学习班得到解决”的教导，举办一期有县直机关工作人员参加的毛泽东思想学习班，以毛泽东思想为武器，发动和依靠群众解决县革委会实行“精兵简政”的问题。
    依靠群众，才能破得彻底，立得牢固
    县直机关工作人员，对待“精兵简政”，有着各种各样的活思想。归结起来，就是不理解实行精兵简政是一场尖锐的、深刻的阶级斗争，新的革命机构，同剥削阶级的旧观念，旧作风，存在着尖锐的矛盾。只有狠批中国赫鲁晓夫在政权建设方面所推行的反革命修正主义路线，大破旧观念，旧作风，才能在新的思想基础上建成新的革命机构，大立革命新作风。所以，学习班刚刚开始，有的同志塌不下心，坐不住，他们说：“批不批都一样，说到底还是个走留问题。”革委会和支左小组的同志针对这种活思想，引导学习班全体成员首先狠批中国赫鲁晓夫在政权建设方面所推行的反革命修正主义路线。　　　
    在大批判期间，县革委会还把脱离群众的官僚主义旧机构的坏处打印成材料，发至全县，发动广大人民群众和学习班成员一起，内外配合，进行批判。经过批判，一些原来对“精兵简政”认识不很清的人，深有体会地说：“不批不知道，一批吓一跳，不把中国赫鲁晓夫反革命修正主义路线批倒，社会主义江山就难保！”
    随着革命大批判的深入进行，一小撮阶级敌人看到他们复辟资本主义的美梦即将完全破灭，便在幕前或幕后对“精兵简政”进行恶毒攻击。大家牢记毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的教导，更加深入地开展革命大批判，粉碎了阶级敌人的破坏阴谋。
    县革委会成员深深懂得：广大革命干部和广大革命群众是旧机构、旧规章制度的直接受害者，又是革命、生产第一线的指挥员和战斗员。他们最懂得应该破什么，立什么。他们既有改革的愿望，又有具体打算。因此，必须放手发动他们破，更要依靠他们立。于是，全县组织了有革命委员会主要负责干部、革命群众代表和解放军代表参加的“三结合”小组，到群众中去，和大家一起学习，一起讨论，一起想办法，一起提出方案。他们把群众中的智慧集中起来，又拿到群众中广泛征求意见，组织大家分组讨论，反复比较，反复修改，最后形成了一个革命委员会的精兵简政方案。这个方案，破在脱离群众的要害处，立在联系群众的根本上。破除了手续繁多、互相扯皮的层次；合并了业务相似的部门；大力压缩脱产人员，加强革命、生产第一线。
      深入开展群众性思想互助活动
    彻底改革旧机构，创立无产阶级革命化的新机构，这不仅是一场组织上的大革命，更是一场群众性的思想大革命。在这场革命中，新与旧、公与私的斗争，必然会不断地表现出来。学习班刚开始，有些同志认为，怎样破，怎样立，领导早有安排，因此，对大破大立不太关心，急于让领导亮方案。这个现象正反映了县革命委员会在前一段工作中，走群众路线不够的缺点。县革委会成员意识到这一点以后，立即主动到群众中去作自我批评，和群众一块促膝谈心，交换意见。使大家认识到，精兵简政不只是走一批、留一批的问题，而是一场群众性的思想大革命，这是人民的大事，是巩固无产阶级政权的大事，只依靠少数领导的空忙，是无济于事的。革委会成员还耐心地启发群众在精兵简政中当主人，出主意，想办法。这样一来，群众性的思想互助活动，就在学习班里迅速展开。
    精兵简政涉及到人员的走留和去向问题，这是一场公与私的激烈斗争，触及到每一个人的灵魂。参加学习班的同志，以“斗私，批修”为纲，以张思德、白求恩为镜子，广泛开展谈心活动，把资产阶级
  “私”字扫地出门，让无产阶级的“公”字安家落户，保证了精兵简政工作的顺利进行。
