Mozambican guerrilla fighters engaged in armed struggle have enthusiastically praised Chairman Mao's military thought, saying, "Not only did it guide the Chinese revolutionary war to victory, but it also opened up a bright path to liberation for the oppressed and exploited revolutionary peoples of the whole world." They said, "Chairman Mao is the greatest revolutionary leader." "Mao Zedong Thought inspires African revolutionaries to achieve victory after victory."

	Walking the Path of Armed Struggle

Chairman Mao's brilliant assertion that "political power grows out of the barrel of a gun" has greatly inspired Mozambican guerrilla fighters who have taken up the path of armed struggle. The Mozambican people, who have suffered long-term exploitation and oppression by colonialism, harbor a deep hatred for the brutal colonialists. They have taken up arms to fight bravely. Guerrilla fighter Almeida is a worker's son. He has seen Portuguese colonialists slaughter and beat Mozambican workers. After joining the guerrilla forces, his family members were all arrested and imprisoned. He said angrily, "The colonialists use guns and knives to kill us, forcing us to take up arms to fight for the liberation of the suffering Mozambican people. I will hold my gun tightly and fight to the last drop of blood."

Fighter Lagos said, "As Chairman Mao pointed out, reactionaries will not withdraw from the historical stage of their own accord. The Portuguese colonialists will not withdraw from the historical stage of their own accord. The history of the Mozambican people's struggle has proven that only by taking up arms can we drive away the Portuguese colonialists who are armed to the teeth." A guerrilla squad leader, after studying Chairman Mao's brilliant work "Problems of War and Strategy," said, "We must carry the armed struggle through to the end and seize political power by force. We must not harbor any illusions about imperialism and all reactionaries, nor should we accept the 'persuasion' of some people to engage in 'peace talks' with them."

	Victory Will Surely Be Ours

Chairman Mao's brilliant strategic thought that imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers has armed the minds of Mozambican guerrilla fighters, enhancing their confidence in victory. Guerrilla fighter Sule said, "Studying great Mao Zedong Thought has made me understand that the seemingly powerful imperialism is actually a paper tiger. The truly powerful force is not imperialism but the people. The fact that the Chinese people drove out imperialism and the Vietnamese and Mozambican peoples have continuously achieved victories has proven Chairman Mao's assertion." Fighter Laucha had once felt disappointed about the Mozambican people's history of several failed uprisings. After studying Chairman Mao's teaching of "struggle, fail, struggle again, fail again, struggle again until victory—this is the logic of the people," he enhanced his fighting spirit. He said, "Chairman Mao's teaching has made me understand that our struggle is just. Although we suffer some failures, victory will surely be ours in the end."

Many guerrilla fighters said with unwavering confidence that although our strength is currently weak compared to the enemy, we will grow from small to large and from weak to strong, ultimately achieving victory.

	Strategies and Tactics of People's War

Many Mozambican guerrilla fighters diligently study and apply Chairman Mao's strategies and tactics of people's war. After studying Chairman Mao's thought of concentrating superior forces to fight annihilation battles, the soldiers of a certain platoon annihilated nearly a hundred enemy soldiers in one battle. Soldier Mnipu summed up the battle by saying, "We must fight annihilation battles. We must, as Chairman Mao taught, concentrate absolutely superior forces to annihilate the enemy one by one, and we will surely effectively annihilate the enemy and achieve victory."

A guerrilla leader called on the fighters to engage in more annihilation battles and launch competitions to capture more prisoners and seize more weapons. A guerrilla cadre, while politically mobilizing the fighters, said, "When we fight, we must, as Chairman Mao taught, 'resolutely fight, fear no sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory.' Even if only one person is left, we must continue to fight."

	Rely on the Masses and Cherish the Masses

Chairman Mao said, "Revolutionary war is the people's war. Only by mobilizing the masses can we wage war, and only by relying on the masses can we wage war." Mozambican guerrilla fighters pay great attention to relying on the masses and cherishing their interests in battle. Guerrilla cadre Flascis said, "No matter where we go to fight, we must follow Chairman Mao's teachings and blend in with the masses. The people are the sea, and we are the fish. We must rely on the support of the masses to win the people's war."

The "Three Main Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention" formulated by Chairman Mao for the Chinese People's Liberation Army have been warmly welcomed by Mozambican guerrilla fighters. Once, a squad of guerrilla fighters returned to their camp after marching. The direct route was very short, but it required passing through a farmer's sweet potato field. Squad leader Mckaka told everyone, "We must cherish the interests of the masses and not damage the crops of the common people." Although the fighters were all tired, they all voluntarily took a detour back to the camp.

	Long Live Mao Zedong Thought

Mozambican guerrilla fighters deeply love Chairman Mao and the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. They say, Mao Zedong Thought makes African revolutionaries see clearly and grow stronger in battle. A guerrilla cadre said, "Whenever we encounter difficulties on the front line, we open Chairman Mao's works for study, just like the soldiers in the Chinese film 'The Tunnel War.' Chairman Mao's teachings give us boundless strength."

The guerrilla fighters eagerly want to obtain the little red book "Quotations from Chairman Mao." Fighter Binifloro was an illiterate farmer before joining the guerrilla forces. After obtaining the Portuguese version of "Quotations from Chairman Mao," he overcame difficulties and began learning to read. Now he can recite from memory quotations such as "Who are our enemies? Who are our friends? This is the key question for revolution." Some fighters have copied entire works by Chairman Mao such as "Care for the People's Livelihood, Pay Attention to Work Methods" and "Oppose Liberalism" into their notebooks for study at any time.

Guerrilla fighter Victor said passionately, "Great Mao Zedong Thought is the guiding light. Under the brilliant illumination of Mao Zedong Thought, Mozambican freedom fighters will not lose our way. Our hearts, fighting in the African jungles, will forever be connected with Chairman Mao." He enthusiastically shouted, "Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought! Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years, ten thousand years!"

    莫三鼻给游击战士在战斗中学习和运用毛主席的人民战争战略战术
    毛泽东思想使非洲革命者心明眼亮越战越强
    新华社达累斯萨拉姆电　正在进行武装斗争的非洲南部莫三鼻给游击战士热情赞扬毛主席的军事思想“不仅引导中国革命战争取得了胜利，而且为全世界被压迫、被剥削的革命人民开辟了争取解放的光明大道。”他们说：“毛主席是最伟大的革命领袖。”“毛泽东思想鼓舞着非洲革命战士取得一个又一个胜利。”
        走武装斗争的道路
    毛主席的“枪杆子里面出政权”的英明论断极大地鼓舞着已经踏上武装斗争道路的莫三鼻给游击战士。受尽殖民主义长期剥削和压迫的莫三鼻给人民，对残暴的殖民主义者燃烧着强烈的民族仇恨，他们拿起武器进行了英勇的斗争。游击战士阿尔梅伊达是一个工人的儿子，他亲眼看到葡萄牙殖民主义者屠杀和毒打莫三鼻给工人。阿尔梅伊达参加游击队后，他的亲人都先后被捕入狱。他满腔愤怒地说：“殖民主义者用刀枪残杀我们，逼着我们拿起武器进行斗争，解放苦难中的莫三鼻给人民。我一定紧握手中枪，战斗到最后一滴血。”
    战士拉高斯说：“正如毛主席所指出的那样，反动派是不会自行退出历史舞台的。葡萄牙殖民主义者也决不会自行退出历史舞台，莫三鼻给人民斗争的历史证明，只有拿起武器才能把武装到牙齿的葡萄牙殖民主义者赶走。”一位游击队队长在学习了毛主席的《战争和战略问题》的光辉著作后说，我们要把武装斗争进行到底，要武装夺取政权。对帝国主义和一切反动派不能抱任何幻想，也不能接受某些人的“劝说”，同它们进行“和谈”。
        胜利一定属于我们
    毛主席关于帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎的光辉战略思想武装了莫三鼻给游击战士的头脑，增强了他们必胜的信心。游击战士苏勒说：“学习了伟大的毛泽东思想使我懂得了貌似强大的帝国主义实际上是一只纸老虎，真正强大的不是帝国主义而是人民。中国人民赶走了帝国主义，越南人民、莫三鼻给人民不断取得胜利的事实，证实了毛主席的这一论断。”战士拉乌沙以前对莫三鼻给人民历史上数次起义失败曾经感到失望。他在学习了毛主席的“斗争，失败，再斗争，再失败，再斗争，直至胜利——这就是人民的逻辑”这一教导后增强了斗争信心。他说：“毛主席的教导使我明白了我们的斗争是正义的，尽管遭受一些失败，最后胜利一定属于我们。”
    许多游击战士信心百倍地说，虽然我们的力量目前同敌人相比是弱小的，但是我们会由小变大，由弱变强，取得最后胜利。
        人民战争的战略战术
    许多莫三鼻给游击战士孜孜不倦地学习和运用毛主席关于人民战争的战略战术。他们在学习了毛主席的集中优势兵力打歼灭战的思想后，某连战士们在一次战斗中一举歼灭了近百名敌军。战士姆尼普在总结战斗时说：“一定要打歼灭战。我们要象毛主席教导的那样，集中绝对优势兵力，各个歼灭敌人，就一定能有效地消灭敌人，取得胜利。”
    一位游击队负责人号召战士们多打歼灭战，展开多抓俘虏、多缴武器的竞赛。一位游击队干部在对战士进行政治动员时说：“我们作战时要象毛主席教导的那样：‘下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。’那怕剩下一个人也要战斗下去。”
        依靠群众　爱护群众
    毛主席说：“革命战争是群众的战争，只有动员群众才能进行战争，只有依靠群众才能进行战争。”莫三鼻给游击战士在战斗中非常注意依靠群众和爱护群众的利益。游击队干部弗拉西斯说：“我们不论到那里打仗都要遵照毛主席的教导，同群众打成一片。人民是水，我们是鱼。我们进行人民战争必须依靠群众的支持才能获胜。”
    毛主席为中国人民解放军制订的“三大纪律，八项注意”得到了莫三鼻给游击战士的热烈拥护。一次一队游击战士行军回宿营地，走直路很近，但要踩过农民一片红薯地。队长姆卡卡向大家说：“我们要爱护群众利益，不能损坏老百姓的庄稼。”战士们虽然都很累，但都自觉地绕道走回宿营地。
        毛泽东思想万岁
    莫三鼻给游击战士非常热爱毛主席和战无不胜的毛泽东思想。他们说，毛泽东思想使非洲革命者心明眼亮，越战越坚强。一位游击队干部说：“每当我们在前线碰到困难时，就象中国电影《地道战》里的战士一样，打开毛主席的著作进行学习。毛主席的教导给我们增添了无比的力量。”
    游击战士们非常渴望得到红色宝书《毛主席语录》。战士比尼弗洛参加游击队之前是不识字的农民。自从得到葡文版的《毛主席语录》后，他克服困难，从识字开始进行学习。现在他已能熟背“谁是我们的敌人？谁是我们的朋友？这个问题是革命的首要问题”等语录。有的战士把毛主席的《关心群众生活，注意工作方法》、《反对自由主义》等著作整篇地抄在自己的笔记本上，以便随时进行学习。
    游击战士维克多热情洋溢地说：“伟大的毛泽东思想是指路明灯。我们莫三鼻给自由战士在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下就不会迷失方向。我们这些战斗在非洲丛林里的战士们的心永远和毛主席连结在一起。”他热烈欢呼：“战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！”“毛主席万岁！万万岁！”
