New Zealand workers are demanding wage increases and striking against the exploitation and oppression of the monopoly bourgeoisie. The struggle is rapidly developing.

In Auckland, drivers at the New Zealand Brewery have been on strike for several days, and this strike is now spreading to other large breweries. Over a hundred glass workers and more than two hundred asbestos workers, as well as steel workers at the Glenbrook Steel Mill, are also on strike. Several hundred engineers and electricians have refused to work overtime to protest the capitalists' refusal to increase wages. In Wellington, brewery workers went on strike on the 9th. In Christchurch, over two hundred rubber workers have been on strike for nearly a week.

    据新华社惠灵顿十日电　新西兰工人阶级要求增加工资、反对垄断资产阶级剥削和压榨的罢工斗争正在迅速发展。
    在奥克兰，新西兰啤酒厂的司机举行了几天的罢工，这次罢工正在扩展到其他大的啤酒公司。一百多名玻璃工人和二百多名石棉工人以及格莱布鲁克钢厂的炼钢工人也正在举行罢工。还有几百名工程师和电气工人拒绝加班，以抗议资本家拒绝增加工资。在惠灵顿，啤酒厂工人九日举行了罢工。在克赖斯特彻奇，两百多名橡胶工人举行的罢工，已坚持了将近一个星期。
