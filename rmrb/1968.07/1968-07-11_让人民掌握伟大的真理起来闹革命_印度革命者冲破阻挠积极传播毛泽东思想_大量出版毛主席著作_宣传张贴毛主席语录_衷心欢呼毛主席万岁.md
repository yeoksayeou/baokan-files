Indian revolutionaries are breaking through the obstacles and vigorously spreading Mao Zedong Thought despite the heavy suppression and crazed repression by the Indian reactionary government. These revolutionaries are striving hard and actively bringing the great truth of Mao Zedong Thought to the suffering masses of Indian laborers, enabling them to grasp and apply this powerful ideological weapon in conjunction with their own revolutionary practices.

The Indian reactionaries fear Mao Zedong Thought like bats fear sunlight. They have torn off the masks of bourgeois "democracy" and "freedom of speech," attacking and sealing publishers of Chairman Mao's works, seizing Chairman Mao's books and the printing plates used to print these works, and arbitrarily arresting and prosecuting the revolutionaries who print these works. However, the wings of crows cannot block the sun. The brilliant "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and the works of Chairman Mao continue to be translated into various Indian languages and widely circulated among the people.

Not long ago, more than ten brilliant works by Chairman Mao, including the "Three Constantly Read Articles," "Analysis of the Classes in Chinese Society," "Report on an Investigation of the Peasant Movement in Hunan," "Why Is the Red Political Power in China Able to Exist?" "A Single Spark Can Start a Prairie Fire," and "To Be Attacked by the Enemy Is Not a Bad Thing but a Good Thing," were published in Hindi translations and sold in various parts of India, receiving a warm welcome from the broad revolutionary masses of India.

Some progressive publications in India have also published large quantities of Chairman Mao's works. For example, the weekly "Patriot" recently published in full the "Preface to the Magazine 'Communist'"; the monthly "Liberation" published "In Memory of Norman Bethune," "Combat Liberalism," and "Rectify the Style of Work." Both progressive publications also published the full text of Vice Chairman Lin Biao's speech at the Beijing People's Commemoration of the 50th Anniversary of the October Revolution.

The "Patriot" weekly on May 2nd published an article emphasizing the great significance of studying and applying Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought. It called on Indian workers, peasants, youth, and students to seriously study "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and "Quotations from Chairman Mao on People's War," which have been translated into Bengali by the "Patriot" weekly. The article called on Indian revolutionaries to widely read and explain this book of quotations to the worker-peasant masses.

In recent months, Indian revolutionaries have posted and written many quotations from Chairman Mao and slogans praising Chairman Mao on the streets of some cities. For example, according to Indian newspapers, on May 1st, handwritten quotations from Chairman Mao in Tamil appeared on the walls of some places in Madras, the capital of Madras State: "Political power grows out of the barrel of a gun." On May 4th, in the streets of Patna, the capital of Bihar State, some slogans were posted, reading: "Long live Mao Zedong!" "Without an army of the people, there is nothing for the people." These slogans were pasted on the walls of the Congress Party headquarters, the tax building, the high court, and some public places.

The Indian revolutionary people use various means and seize every opportunity to express their boundless admiration for the great teacher of the proletariat, Chairman Mao. According to reports, on May 21st, during the mid-term election voting for the Indian Parliament in Nangendra Nagar, West Bengal, there was a ballot with "Long live Chairman Mao Zedong!" and "Red salute to Mao Zedong!" written in Bengali and English.

The tyranny of counter-revolution cannot stop the spread of Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought in India. The great Indian people will apply Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought to their own revolutionary practices, overthrow the brutal rule of the Indian landlords and big bourgeoisie, and achieve thorough liberation.

    让人民掌握伟大的真理起来闹革命
    印度革命者冲破阻挠积极传播毛泽东思想
    大量出版毛主席著作　宣传张贴毛主席语录　衷心欢呼毛主席万岁
    新华社十日讯　新德里消息：印度革命者正在冲破印度反动政府的重重阻挠和疯狂镇压，愈来愈广泛地传播战无不胜的毛泽东思想。这些革命者艰苦奋斗，积极地把毛泽东思想的伟大真理带给苦难深重的印度广大劳动人民，让他们结合本国的革命实践来掌握和运用这个强大的思想武器。
    印度反动派害怕毛泽东思想，象蝙蝠害怕阳光。他们撕下了资产阶级“民主”、“言论自由”的假面具，到处袭击和查封出版毛主席著作的出版社，抢走毛主席著作和印刷这些著作的印版，无理逮捕和通缉印刷这些著作的革命者。但是，乌鸦的翅膀挡不住太阳。光辉灿烂的《毛主席语录》和毛主席著作，继续被译成印度的各种语文出版，并且在人民群众中广泛传播。
    不久以前，毛主席十多篇光辉著作，包括“老三篇”、《中国社会各阶级的分析》、《湖南农民运动考察报告》、《中国红色政权为什么能够存在？》、《星星之火，可以燎原》、《被敌人反对是好事而不是坏事》等印地文译本，在印度各地出售，受到印度广大革命群众的热烈欢迎。
    印度的一些进步刊物，也大量刊载毛主席著作。例如《爱国者》周刊最近全文登载了《〈共产党人〉发刊词》；《解放》月刊登载了《为人民服务》、《反对自由主义》、《反对本本主义》。这两种进步刊物都登载了毛主席今年四月十六日发表的支持美国黑人抗暴斗争的声明。
    这两种进步刊物，还登载了林彪副主席在北京人民纪念十月革命五十周年大会上的讲话全文。
    《爱国者》周刊五月二日曾经发表文章，强调指出学习和运用马克思主义、列宁主义、毛泽东思想的重大意义。它号召印度的工人、农民、青年和学生认真学习《毛主席语录》，学习《毛主席论人民战争》的语录，这本语录已经由《爱国者》周刊译成孟加拉文。文章号召印度的革命者向工农群众广泛宣读和讲解这本语录。
    最近几个月来，印度革命者在一些城市的街道上张贴了和写下了许多毛主席语录和热情赞扬毛主席的标语。例如，据印度报纸透露，五月一日在马德拉斯邦首府马德拉斯市的一些地方的墙壁上出现了手写的泰米尔文的毛主席语录：“枪杆子里面出政权”。五月四日，在比哈尔邦首府巴特那市的街道上，张贴了一些标语，上面写着：“毛泽东万岁！”“没有一个人民的军队，便没有人民的一切。”这些标语贴在国大党党部、税务大楼、高等法院和一些公共场所的墙上。
    印度革命人民利用各种方式、抓住各种机会，表达他们对无产阶级的伟大导师毛主席的无限敬仰。据报道，五月二十一日在西孟加拉邦纳根德拉那加地方举行印度议会的期中选举投票时，有一张选票上用孟加拉文和英文写着：“毛泽东主席万岁！”“向毛泽东致红色的敬礼！”
    反革命的暴政阻挡不了马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想在印度的传播。伟大的印度人民把马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想运用于本国的革命实践，必将推翻印度大地主、大资产阶级的残暴统治，取得彻底解放。
