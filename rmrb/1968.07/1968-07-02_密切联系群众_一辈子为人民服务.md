June 30th, we were received by the red sun in our hearts, Chairman Mao. This is the greatest honor of our lives. At this most blessed moment, on behalf of all the officers and soldiers of the regiment, we repeatedly shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand times long live Chairman Mao!" We repeatedly and sincerely wished: "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live Chairman Mao!"

Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! In how many dawns of battle, in how many joyful nights, we, your soldiers, stood on the mountains looking towards Beijing, hoping for the day when we could go to Beijing and stand by your side. You, Chairman Mao, know your soldiers best and care for them the most. In your precious time managing the affairs of the Chinese and world peoples, you received us. This is your greatest concern, trust, encouragement, and motivation for us. Our wish has finally come true, how could we not feel a surge of warmth and excitement?

You recently instructed us: "Whether to protect or suppress the broad masses of the people is the fundamental difference between the Communist Party and the Kuomintang, the fundamental difference between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, and the fundamental difference between proletarian dictatorship and bourgeois dictatorship." You have limitless trust in the masses, rely on the masses, and respect the revolutionary initiative of the masses, connecting hearts with the broad masses of the people.

Following your teachings on maintaining close ties with the masses, over the past year, on the front lines of "three supports, two militaries," we have closely followed your great strategic deployment, firmly supporting and protecting the revolutionary enthusiasm of the masses, thinking about what the masses think, addressing what the masses are urgent about, and helping with what the masses need. Because we resolutely act according to your instructions, we have firmly grasped the direction of the struggle, established a deep bond with the people, and received the support and trust of the broad masses, defending your revolutionary line with practical actions.

"The masses are the real heroes." The practice of revolutionary struggle has made us deeply realize that the attitude towards the masses is the touchstone to test whether we are implementing the proletarian revolutionary line or pushing the reactionary line of the bourgeoisie. Remember in 1965, when we fully mobilized the masses and vigorously implemented Comrade Lin Biao's five principles of emphasizing politics, the entire regiment was filled with a strong atmosphere of emphasizing proletarian politics. Suddenly, a strange wind blew from the counter-revolutionary revisionist element Luo Ruiqing. Someone maliciously attacked us, saying, "You emphasized politics too much in the first half of the year and did less engineering," and repeatedly claimed that we should check on the so-called error of relaxing construction in the first half of the year, attempting to use high-pressure tactics to pull our regiment onto the wrong path of the bourgeois military line. At that time, we felt great pressure, so we followed your teachings to consult with the masses on every matter, bringing the problem to the soldiers and reviewing "On Rectifying the Errors in the Party" together. The soldiers' hearts are the clearest, their eyes the brightest, and their stance the firmest. They enthusiastically encouraged us, saying, "If someone wants you to check, then check on the shortcomings of emphasizing politics." With your brilliant thoughts guiding us from above and the support of the broad masses of soldiers from below, we were fearless, unafraid of pressure, and unafraid of coercion, firmly resisting the strange wind. In the struggle to defend your revolutionary line, we relied on the masses and won another victory.

Under the illumination of your brilliant thoughts, we deeply understand that your revolutionary line is the most resolute line to protect the masses and the most thorough mass line. The stronger our mass consciousness, the closer we rely on the masses, the deeper our understanding of your revolutionary line; the closer we are to the masses, the closer we are to you. We will definitely follow your teachings, carry forward the Party's fine tradition of maintaining close ties with the masses, forever be loyal to your revolutionary line, forever be students of the masses, and wholeheartedly serve the Chinese and world peoples, revolution to the end, never wavering.

    密切联系群众　一辈子为人民服务
    工程兵活学活用毛泽东思想标兵单位、某团学习毛主席著作中心组
    六月三十日，我们心中最红的红太阳毛主席接见了我们，这是我们一生中的最大光荣。在这最幸福的时刻，我们受全团指战员的委托，一遍又一遍地高呼：“毛主席万岁，万万岁！”一遍又一遍地衷心祝愿：毛主席万寿无疆！万寿无疆！
    毛主席啊，毛主席！多少个战斗的黎明，多少个欢乐的夜晚，您的战士——我们，站在高山望北京，想着有那么一天，去到北京，站在您老人家的身边。您老人家最了解战士，最关心战士。您在为中国人民和世界人民日理万机的宝贵时间里，接见了我们，这是对我们的最大关怀、最大信任、最大鼓舞、最大鞭策。我们的愿望终于实现了，怎能不使我们全身暖流滚滚、激情奔腾呢！
    您老人家最近教导我们：“对广大人民群众是保护还是镇压，是共产党同国民党的根本区别，是无产阶级同资产阶级的根本区别，是无产阶级专政同资产阶级专政的根本区别。”您老人家无限地相信群众，依靠群众，尊重群众的革命首创精神，同广大人民群众心连心。
    我们遵循您老人家关于密切联系群众的教导，一年多来，在“三支”、“两军”第一线，紧跟您老人家的伟大战略部署，坚定不移地支持和保护群众的革命积极性，想群众之所想，急群众之所急，帮群众之所需。由于坚决按照您老人家的指示办事，因而牢牢掌握了斗争大方向，和人民群众建立了深厚的鱼水之情，受到了广大人民的拥护和支持，用实际行动捍卫了您老人家的革命路线。
    “群众是真正的英雄”。革命斗争的实践，使我们深刻地认识到，对人民群众采取什么态度，是检验我们执行无产阶级革命路线还是推行资产阶级反动路线的试金石。记得一九六五年我们充分发动群众，大力贯彻林副主席突出政治的五项原则，全团上下出现一派突出无产阶级政治的浓厚空气的时候，突然从反革命修正主义分子罗瑞卿那里袭来了一股妖风。有人恶毒地攻击我们“上半年突出政治太多了，工程搞少了”，并口口声声地扬言要我们检查所谓上半年放松了施工的“错误”，妄图用高压手段把我们团拉到资产阶级军事路线的邪道上去。当时，我们感到压力很大，便遵照您老人家关于遇事找群众商量的教导，带着问题和战士一起重温《关于纠正党内的错误思想》，发动大家讨论我们团的大方向到底错了没有。广大战士的心最明，眼最亮，立场最坚定，热情地鼓励我们说：“有人要你们检查，你们就检查突出政治不够的差距。”上有您老人家的光辉思想的指引，下有广大战士的支持，使我们浑身是胆，不怕压，不怕迫，坚决地顶住了妖风。在捍卫您老人家的革命路线的斗争中，我们依靠群众又一次取得了胜利。
    在您的光辉思想照耀下，使我们深切地懂得，您老人家的革命路线，就是最坚决地保护群众的路线，是最彻底的群众路线。我们的群众观念越强，靠群众越近，对您老人家的革命路线理解就越深；和群众越亲，跟您老人家就越紧。我们一定遵循您的教导，发扬党的密切联系群众的优良作风，永远忠于您老人家的革命路线，永远当群众的小学生，全心全意地为中国人民和世界人民服务，革命到底，永不变心。
