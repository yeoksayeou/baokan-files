The revolutionary committee of Changgang Commune in Jiangxi Province's Xingguo County has carried forward the glorious tradition of the cadres of Changgang Township, who were personally cultivated by the great leader Chairman Mao to be closely connected with the masses, care for the masses, and share weal and woe with the masses. They strive to create "first-class work," earning the enthusiastic praise of the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants. The New China News Agency reported from Nanchang on the 14th that the revolutionary committee of Changgang Commune in Xingguo County, Jiangxi Province, has carried forward the glorious tradition of the cadres of Changgang Township, who were personally cultivated by the great leader Chairman Mao to be closely connected with the masses, care for the masses, and share weal and woe with the masses. They strive to create "first-class work," earning the enthusiastic praise of the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants.

Over thirty years ago, the great leader Chairman Mao came to Changgang and wrote the famous "Investigation of Changgang Township." Under Chairman Mao's personal leadership and cultivation, the cadres of Changgang Township at that time, with their excellent style of being connected with the masses, caring for the masses, and leading the masses in arduous struggle, created "first-class work." In his brilliant work "Care for the Masses' Livelihood, Pay Attention to Work Methods," Chairman Mao praised them as "model cadres of Changgang Township, respectable cadres of Changgang Township" and personally set up Changgang Township as a red banner in the Soviet area at that time, calling on people to "learn from Changgang Township" and "create thousands of Changgang Townships." Today, thirty years later, the revolutionary committee of Changgang Commune has taken over and carried forward the traditional style of the cadres of Changgang Township at that time, personally cultivated by Chairman Mao. They have established a flesh-and-blood connection with the masses and deeply rooted themselves among the masses, thus leading the poor and lower-middle peasants of the entire commune to achieve one victory after another in revolution and production. Throughout the commune, Mao Zedong Thought has been widely popularized, the dictatorship of the proletariat has been strengthened, and the socialist front has been consolidated. This year, the spring crops of the entire commune have increased production by twofold compared to last year, achieving a bumper harvest; the early and mid-season rice seedlings are growing better than in any previous year. Groups of revolutionary masses from various parts of the province who came to Changgang for study and observation unanimously praised the revolutionary committee of Changgang Commune for creating new "first-class work," making it a red banner for the entire province to learn from.

On March 6th of this year, Changgang Commune was the first in the county to establish a commune revolutionary committee. On that day, all the members of the revolutionary committee went to Changgang Brigade to visit the revolutionary memorial hall recording Chairman Mao's investigation in Changgang, visit the revolutionary old cadres who Chairman Mao had visited, and participate in labor in the fields where Chairman Mao had worked. Finally, they went to the old site of Lenin Primary School, where Chairman Mao held the investigation meeting, and reviewed Chairman Mao's brilliant works "Investigation of Changgang Township" and "Care for the Masses' Livelihood, Pay Attention to Work Methods." Chairman Mao's great revolutionary practice and the revolutionary traditions personally cultivated by him gave the members of the revolutionary committee a profound education. They said excitedly: "The style of being closely connected with the masses, personally cultivated by Chairman Mao, is the best example for us members of the revolutionary committee to learn from. The red banner of Changgang Township, personally set up by Chairman Mao to implement the mass line, is the banner under which our revolutionary committee fights. We must carry forward the revolutionary traditions and strive for greater glory, inherit the revolutionary traditions personally cultivated by Chairman Mao, and hold high the red banner of Changgang Township personally set up by Chairman Mao. With first-class style, we will create first-class work!" All the members of the revolutionary committee immediately formulated several regulations to carry forward glorious traditions and be closely connected with the masses.

Changgang Commune has over 4,400 households and covers an area of forty to fifty li horizontally and vertically. However, the revolutionary committee, which includes representatives of poor and lower-middle peasants, itself has the superior condition of being connected with the masses. The commune revolutionary committee fully utilizes and develops this superiority, taking the revolutionary traditions personally cultivated by Chairman Mao as an example, and from all aspects, it has strengthened its connection with the poor and lower-middle peasants.

Most of the members of the commune revolutionary committee are non-full-time representatives of poor and lower-middle peasants. They are distributed in various brigades and have close connections with the masses. Therefore, the revolutionary committee plays the role of a bridge, using them to widely connect with the masses, propagate to the masses, and organize the masses, bringing the opinions and demands of the masses to the revolutionary committee and bringing the resolutions and tasks of the revolutionary committee to the masses.

The full-time members of the commune revolutionary committee also, like the cadres of Changgang Township at that time, often go deep into the masses. The revolutionary committee divides the entire commune into several areas, and the full-time members are responsible for these areas, staying in the production teams, living in the homes of poor and lower-middle peasants, humbly learning from the masses, patiently listening to the opinions of the masses, actively accepting the supervision of the masses, and taking root among the masses.

The revolutionary committee often holds open rectification meetings. Since the establishment of the commune revolutionary committee, it has invited representatives of poor and lower-middle peasants from the entire commune to provide opinions and suggestions four times. Every time a rectification is conducted, the connection between the members of the revolutionary committee and the masses is strengthened.

The revolutionary committee of Changgang Commune, taking the revolutionary traditions personally cultivated by Chairman Mao as a model, often organizes all its members to compare themselves with the model, use Mao Zedong Thought to criticize various bourgeois influences, and constantly eliminate bad styles of being detached from the masses, forever maintaining the good style of being connected with the masses.

The revolutionary committee of Changgang Commune has carried forward the revolutionary traditions personally cultivated by Chairman Mao, establishing a broad and constant close connection with the poor and lower-middle peasants, which has effectively promoted the thought revolutionization of the leading cadre and the work of the revolutionary committee. Revolutionary mass representative Chen Chengzhi, after becoming the vice chairman of the revolutionary committee, still, like an ordinary mass, discusses matters with the masses, engages in struggle against selfishness and revisionism with the masses, and blends in with the masses. He said: "Being connected with the masses is a tradition set by Chairman Mao, the fundamental style of our party. If a revolutionary loses this style, his thoughts will deteriorate; if a revolutionary regime loses this style, the regime will change color." Vice Chairman Liu Zongyuan was originally the secretary of the commune party committee. Through learning the traditional style and personal practice, he realized that the fundamental reason for his past mistakes was that he had become detached from the masses. Now, he is closely connected with the masses, living in the homes of commune members, learning from the poor and lower-middle peasants as teachers, and humbly listening to the opinions of the masses. Through practice, he deeply felt: "The tradition set by Chairman Mao is forever my example to learn from, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants are forever my teachers to learn from, and being closely connected with the masses is a style I will forever maintain."

"Revolutionary committees are truly good, they think of everything for us!"

Caring for the masses' livelihood is the traditional style of the cadres of Changgang Township at that time, personally cultivated by Chairman Mao. In his brilliant work "Care for the Masses' Livelihood, Pay Attention to Work Methods," Chairman Mao recorded the vivid deeds of the cadres of Changgang Township at that time caring for the masses' livelihood and the high praise of the masses for the cadres: "The Communist Party is truly good, they think of everything for us." After the establishment of the revolutionary committee of Changgang Commune, while leading the broad masses to fiercely grasp class struggle and earnestly implement Chairman Mao's great line of "grasp revolution, promote production," the members of the revolutionary committee, like the cadres of Changgang Township at that time, with deep proletarian feelings, care for the masses' livelihood, sympathize with the masses' sufferings, and do not neglect or belittle the personal interests of the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants. Recently, the entire commune suffered a once-in-a-century major flood. The revolutionary committee promptly organized the masses to fight against the flood and rescue the situation, protecting the people's lives and property. As soon as the flood receded, some production teams lacked firewood and vegetables, so the revolutionary committee quickly organized brother production teams to send them firewood and vegetables. Some production teams had part of their crops submerged and needed to replant, so the revolutionary committee promptly obtained seeds from the county. The members of the revolutionary committee also brought Chairman Mao's works to the production teams, set up Mao Zedong Thought study classes, organized commune members to study and apply Mao Zedong Thought actively, and carry forward the spirit of self-reliance and arduous struggle, quickly restoring production. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants praised: "Revolutionary committees are truly good, they think of everything for us!"

The great leader Chairman Mao teaches: "Do you want the support of the masses? Do you want the masses to devote all their strength to the front? Then you must be with the masses, you must mobilize the masses' enthusiasm, you must care for the masses' pains and itches, you must sincerely work for the masses' interests, solve the masses' production and livelihood problems." The revolutionary committee of Changgang Commune often uses Chairman Mao's teaching to admonish itself. They say that whether or not to care for the masses' livelihood is an important sign of how deep one's class feelings for the masses are, and it is a very important issue of whether or not to be closely connected with the masses. Therefore, the revolutionary committee often puts the masses' livelihood problems on the agenda, discusses and decides, and implements them in earnest. The members of the revolutionary committee not only personally receive and handle the masses' visits and letters, enthusiastically helping the masses solve problems, but also often go to the homes of poor and lower-middle peasants to inquire about their well-being and solve problems at their doorsteps.

The revolutionary committee of Changgang Commune cares for the masses in everything and thinks for the masses in every aspect. The broad masses love, support, and support the revolutionary committee even more. They have good ideas and enthusiastically submit them to the revolutionary committee; when the comrades of the revolutionary committee have shortcomings, they sincerely point them out. When a handful of class enemies attempt to shake the revolutionary committee, they resolutely expose and strike them. They say: "The revolutionary committee represents our interests as poor and lower-middle peasants, and it breathes with us poor and lower-middle peasants. We support it a thousand times and support it ten thousand times!"

"Revolutionary committee comrades have a good style, arduous struggle for revolution"

"Soviet area cadres have a good style, carrying their own food to work, wearing straw shoes to revolutionize, walking mountain roads with lanterns at night." This is a mountain song from over thirty years ago, praising the good style of arduous struggle of the cadres of Changgang Township. Now, the newly born revolutionary committee of Changgang Commune has carried forward this glorious revolutionary tradition. All the members of the revolutionary committee work hard, have simple styles, handle affairs meticulously, insist on participating in collective production labor, and maintain the character of the working people. They go to the brigades wearing straw shoes and carrying umbrellas. Some members even carry manure baskets, picking up manure along the way for the production teams. They live in the homes of poor and lower-middle peasants, eat the same food as the masses, pay the food expenses to the masses in full, and never eat or take more. Chairman Xiao Chenglan works in whichever production team, participates in collective production labor in that team, and is not afraid of hard work or dirt. He carries the heavy loads, does the dirty work, and often rolls in the mud, sweating all over. The poor and lower-middle peasants see this in their hearts and are happy. Sometimes they say to him: "You were raised in the mud, and now you are the chairman of the revolutionary committee, and your work is busy, so you don't have to roll in the mud." Xiao Chenglan always replies: "Arduous struggle is a tradition personally cultivated by Chairman Mao, participating in labor is the character of the working people. Working conditions have improved, but the tradition cannot be discarded; being the chairman of the revolutionary committee, the character cannot be changed. I am here to serve the poor and lower-middle peasants, and my body can never be separated from the mud!"

The members of the revolutionary committee of Changgang Commune carry forward the traditional style of arduous struggle, which is also reflected in carrying forward the revolutionary spirit of "the more difficult the place, the more we should go" to help some backward teams change their appearance. Shiyan Brigade is located in the farthest and most remote mountain valley, with a relatively poor work foundation, and is a backward team. In the past, some cadres did not want to go there. Soon after the establishment of the commune revolutionary committee, member Xie Mingchang, carrying Chairman Mao's works and luggage, came to Shiyan Brigade. He lived in the homes of poor and lower-middle peasants, worked in the fields with the commune members during the day, and set up Mao Zedong Thought study classes at night, organizing commune members to study Chairman Mao's works. He went to the commune for meetings, a journey of over twenty li, and no matter the time, as soon as the meeting was over, he rushed back to promptly convey to the brigade cadres and commune members. The brigade's production was not very good in the past, and living conditions were relatively harsh, but he did not treat himself specially. He always used Chairman Mao's teachings to inspire the masses to carry forward the spirit of self-reliance and arduous struggle, pushing production up. Xie Mingchang armed the masses with Mao Zedong Thought and led the masses and brigade cadres with his own style of arduous struggle, making the masses and cadres of this brigade unite as one, achieving victory after victory in spring and summer production, and significantly changing the backward appearance. The commune members of this brigade said: "Revolutionary committee comrades have a good style, arduous struggle for revolution; the masses and cadres unite as one, Changgang Commune is all red."

    继承和发扬毛主席亲自培育的革命传统
    密切联系群众关心群众与群众同甘共苦
    长冈公社革委会努力创造“第一等的工作”，受到广大贫下中农热烈赞扬
    新华社南昌十四日电 江西兴国县长冈公社革命委员会，发扬伟大领袖毛主席亲自培育的当年长冈乡工作人员联系群众、关心群众、与群众同甘共苦的光荣传统，努力创造新的“第一等的工作”，得到全社贫下中农的爱戴，广大群众称赞他们是新的“模范的长冈乡工作人员”。
    三十多年前，伟大领袖毛主席来到长冈，写下了著名的《长冈乡调查》。在毛主席的亲自领导和培育下，当年的长冈乡干部以联系群众、关心群众、带领群众艰苦奋斗的优良作风，创造了“第一等的工作”。毛主席在《关心群众生活，注意工作方法》这篇光辉文献中，赞扬他们是“模范的长冈乡工作人员，可尊敬的长冈乡工作人员”，并亲手树立长冈乡为当年苏区的一面红旗，号召“学习长冈乡”，“要造成几千个长冈乡”。三十多年后的今天，长冈公社革命委员会把毛主席亲自培育的当年长冈乡工作人员的传统作风接了过来，发扬光大，和群众建立起血肉联系，深深扎根于群众之中，从而率领全社贫下中农社员迎来了革命和生产的一个个胜利。在全社，毛泽东思想空前大普及，无产阶级专政空前加强，社会主义阵地空前巩固。今年全社的春收作物比去年增产两倍，获得了特大丰收；早中稻禾苗，长得比以往任何一年都好。从省内各地到长冈参观学习的一批批革命群众，一致称赞长冈公社革委会创造了新的“第一等的工作”，是全省学习的一面红旗。
      把毛主席培育的革命传统作风继承下
    来，把毛主席树立的长冈红旗举得更高
    今年三月六日，长冈公社在全县第一个成立了公社革命委员会。这天，全体革委会成员来到长冈大队，参观记载毛主席在长冈作调查的革命纪念馆，访问毛主席当年访问过的革命老干部，到毛主席当年劳动过的田地里参加劳动；最后，来到毛主席当年开调查会的列宁小学旧址，重温了毛主席的《长冈乡调查》和《关心群众生活，注意工作方法》等光辉著作。毛主席的伟大革命实践和毛主席亲自培育的革命传统作风，给革委会成员以深刻的教育。大家激动地说：“毛主席当年亲自培育的密切联系群众的作风，是我们革委会成员学习的最好榜样，毛主席当年亲手树立的贯彻群众路线的长冈红旗，是我们革委会战斗的旗帜。我们一定要发扬革命传统，争取更大光荣，把毛主席亲自培育的革命传统作风继承下来，把毛主席亲手树立的长冈红旗高举起来，以第一等的作风创造出第一等的工作！”全体革委会成员当即制定了发扬光荣传统、密切联系群众的若干规定。
    长冈公社有四千四百多户，横直四五十里，地区大，又分散。但是，有贫下中农代表参加的革命委员会，本身就具有联系群众的优越条件。公社革委会充分运用和发挥这种优越性，以当年毛主席亲自培育的革命传统作风为榜样，从各方面密切了与贫下中农的联系。
    公社革委会成员多数是不脱产的贫下中农代表，他们分布在各个大队，同群众联系密切。因此，革委会就发挥他们的桥梁作用，通过他们广泛联系群众、宣传群众、组织群众，把群众的意见和要求带到革委会里来，把革委会的决议和任务带到群众中去。
    公社革委会中脱产的成员，也象当年长冈乡工作人员那样，经常深入到群众中去。革委会将全社划成若干片，脱产的成员分片包干，蹲到生产队里，住到贫下中农家里，虚心向群众学习，耐心听取群众意见，主动接受群众监督，在群众中落脚生根。
    革委会经常开门整风。公社革委会成立以来，已先后四次邀请全社贫下中农代表，给革委会提意见，出主意。每进行一次整风，革委会成员同群众的联系就前进一步。
    公社革委会以毛主席当年亲自培育的革命传统作风为样板，经常组织全体成员对照自己找差距，用毛泽东思想去批判各种资产阶级思想影响，不断扫除脱离群众的不良作风，永远保持联系群众的优良作风。
    长冈公社革委会发扬毛主席亲自培育的革命传统作风，同贫下中农建立起了广泛、经常的密切联系，有力地促进了领导班子的思想革命化，推动了革委会的各项工作。革命群众代表陈承志当上革委会副主任后，仍然和普通群众一样，有事同群众商量，同群众一起斗私批修，同群众打成一片。他说：“联系群众是毛主席树立的传统，是我党的根本作风。一个革命者如果丢掉了这个作风，思想就要变质；一个革命政权如果丢掉了这种作风，政权就要变色。”革委会副主任刘宗源原来是公社党委书记，通过学习传统作风和亲身实践，认识到自己过去所以犯错误，根本原因就是脱离了群众。现在，他密切联系群众，住到社员家里，拜贫下中农为师，虚心听取群众意见。通过实践，他深有体会地说：“毛主席树立的传统，永远是我学习的榜样，广大贫下中农永远是我学习的老师，密切联系群众是我永远要保持的作风。”
        “革命委员会真正好，什么事
    情都替我们想到了！”
    关心群众生活，是毛主席当年亲自培育的长冈乡工作人员的传统作风。毛主席在《关心群众生活，注意工作方法》这篇光辉文献里，记载着当年长冈乡工作人员关心群众生活的生动事迹和群众对工作人员的高度称赞：“共产党真正好，什么事情都替我们想到了。”长冈公社革命委员会成立后，在带领广大群众狠抓阶级斗争，认真贯彻毛主席“抓革命，促生产”这一伟大方针的同时，革委会成员象当年长冈乡工作人员一样，以深厚的无产阶级感情，关心群众生活，体贴群众疾苦，对广大贫下中农的切身利益问题，一点也不疏忽，一点也不看轻。最近全公社遭到百年未有过的特大洪水，革委会及时组织群众抗洪抢险，保护了人民的生命财产。洪水刚退，有些生产队的社员缺柴少菜，革委会便迅速组织兄弟生产队给他们送来了柴和菜。有些生产队一部分农作物被水淹没，需要改种，革委会就及早从县里办来了种籽。革委会成员还带着毛主席著作到生产队，办起毛泽东思想学习班，组织社员活学活用毛泽东思想，发扬自力更生、艰苦奋斗精神，迅速恢复了生产。广大贫下中农称赞说：“革命委员会真正好，什么事情都替我们想到了。”
    伟大领袖毛主席教导说：“要得到群众的拥护么？要群众拿出他们的全力放到战线上去么？那末，就得和群众在一起，就得去发动群众的积极性，就得关心群众的痛痒，就得真心实意地为群众谋利益，解决群众的生产和生活的问题”。长冈公社革委会，经常以毛主席的这一教导来告诫自己。他们说，关不关心群众生活，是对群众的阶级感情深不深的一个重要标志，是能不能密切联系群众的一个很重要的问题。因此，革委会经常把群众生活上的问题提到议事日程上，开展讨论，作出决定，切实执行。革委会成员不仅亲自接待和处理群众的来访来信，热情帮助群众解决问题，还经常到贫下中农家里去问寒问暖，上门解决问题。
    长冈公社革委会事事关心群众，处处为群众着想，广大群众对革委会更加热爱、更加拥护、更加支持。他们有了好主意，就满腔热情地给革委会提出来；革委会的同志有了缺点，他们就真心实意地指出来。当一小撮阶级敌人妄图动摇革命委员会时，他们就坚决揭露，坚决打击。他们说：“革委会是代表我们贫下中农利益的，是和我们贫下中农呼吸相通的，我们一千个拥护，一万个支持！”
    “革委会同志好作风，艰苦奋斗为革命”
    “苏区干部好作风，自带干粮去办公，日着草鞋干革命，夜走山路打灯笼。”这是三十多年前，长冈人民赞扬长冈乡工作人员艰苦奋斗好作风的一首山歌。现在，新生的长冈公社革命委员会，把这个光荣的革命传统发扬光大了。全体革委会成员工作艰苦，作风朴素，办事精打细算，坚持参加集体生产劳动，保持着劳动人民的本色。他们下队工作，脚穿草鞋，头带斗笠。有的成员还提着粪箕，一路走一路为生产队拾粪。他们住到贫下中农家里，同群众吃一样的饭菜，如数付给群众伙食费，从不多吃多占。革委会主任肖承兰工作到那个生产队，就在那个队参加集体生产劳动，而且不怕苦，不怕脏，挑担拣重的，干活抢脏的，经常滚得一身泥，累得一身汗。贫下中农看在眼里，喜在心里。有时对他说：“你是泥巴里滚大的，现在当了革委会主任，工作又忙，就不要滚得一身泥了。”肖承兰总是回答说：“艰苦奋斗是毛主席亲自培育的传统，参加劳动是劳动人民的本色。工作条件好了，传统不能丢；当了革委会主任，本色不能变。我是为贫下中农办事的，身上永远也不能脱离泥巴呀！”
    长冈公社革委会成员发扬艰苦奋斗的传统作风，还表现在发扬“越是困难的地方越是要去”的革命精神，帮助一些后进队改变面貌上。石燕大队处在最远最偏僻的一个山窝里，工作基础较差，是个后进队，过去一些干部下队都不愿意到那里去。公社革委会刚成立，革委会成员谢名昌身揣毛主席著作，背着行李来到了石燕大队。他住到贫下中农家里，白天和社员一道上山下地，参加集体生产劳动，晚上开办毛泽东思想学习班，组织社员学习毛主席著作。他到公社开会，一趟二十多里，不管早晚，会一开完就赶回去，及时向队干部和社员传达。队里过去生产搞得不大好，生活条件比较艰苦，他从不特殊。他总是以毛主席的教导鼓舞群众发扬自力更生、艰苦奋斗的精神，把生产跃上去。谢名昌以毛泽东思想武装群众，以自己艰苦奋斗的作风带动群众和队干部，促使这个队的群众和干部拧成一股劲，春、夏季生产连连打胜仗，显著改变了后进面貌。这个队的社员说：“革委会同志好作风，艰苦奋斗为革命；干群结成一条心，长冈公社一片红。”
