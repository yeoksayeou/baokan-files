The latest instructions from Chairman Mao are the great battle program for the proletarian education revolution. The broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers eagerly hope that college students will carry forward the revolutionary academic style of combining theory with practice, quickly turn Chairman Mao's latest instructions into their actual actions, and catch up with the majestic strides of hundreds of millions of revolutionary people.

The New China News Agency reported on the 25th that workers, peasants, and revolutionary middle school and college students across the country, with boundless love for the great leader Chairman Mao and a high sense of responsibility for the proletarian revolutionary cause, repeatedly and seriously studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions on the education revolution. Based on Chairman Mao's great teachings, they fervently expressed their opinions on how to handle proletarian universities and what kind of college students proletarian universities should cultivate. They declared that they would definitely hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, use Chairman Mao's latest instructions as their weapon, carry out the education revolution to the end, and truly make our universities into red universities of Mao Zedong Thought, so that the college students we cultivate will truly become reliable successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause.

The broad revolutionary masses eagerly hope that college students will resolutely carry out Chairman Mao's latest instructions, quickly catch up with the majestic strides of hundreds of millions of revolutionary people, and together with the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, genuinely carry forward the revolutionary academic style of combining theory with practice advocated by Chairman Mao. They will deeply criticize the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line of China's Khrushchev, and strive to thoroughly smash the old bourgeois educational system and create a new proletarian educational system that shines with the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought!

Only by running universities according to Chairman Mao's latest instructions can we have the kind of universities that workers and peasants need.

The great teacher Chairman Mao has long taught us: "Education must serve proletarian politics and must be combined with productive labor. The working people must become intellectualized, and intellectuals must become laborers." Workers and peasants across the country have expressed that they will definitely follow Chairman Mao's consistent teachings and latest instructions, and run our universities to serve proletarian politics, combine with productive labor, and closely connect with the masses, to cultivate a large number of "socialist-conscious, cultured laborers" for the proletarian revolutionary cause.

Workers at the Jiangxi Nanchang Diesel Engine Factory said that under the control of China's Khrushchev's counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line, the old universities were dominated by bourgeois intellectuals, keeping the broad masses of workers and poor and lower-middle peasants out, alienating from proletarian politics, alienating from reality, and alienating from the masses. Such universities, the working class will never need. We need universities run according to Chairman Mao's instructions. Such universities "select students from workers and peasants with practical experience, study at the school for a few years, and then return to practical production," thus truly cultivating a team of scientific and technological personnel who are both red and expert and are absolutely loyal to Chairman Mao. The members of the Longgang Brigade of Changgang Commune in Xingguo County, a model commune in the revolutionary base area personally established by Chairman Mao, said that Chairman Mao's latest instructions are the beacon for the proletarian education revolution and the great guideline for realizing the intellectualization of intellectuals and the laborization of the working people. Running universities according to Chairman Mao's great instructions, students come from the masses of workers and peasants and return to the masses of workers and peasants, can cultivate new people of communism who have proletarian consciousness, can wield a hammer to work, can hold a hoe to farm, and can hold a pen to write.

An old worker from the Tianjin Second Cotton Mill said that the old universities were a big dyeing vat for cultivating bourgeois successors. Red people who enter will turn black. Our universities must resolutely implement Chairman Mao's proletarian educational line and take the road of combining with workers, peasants, and soldiers to cultivate new-type college students who have high political awareness, do not separate from collective labor, and are supported by workers. Song Xueyi, one of the Five Heroes of Wolf Mountain and a delegate to the Henan Provincial People's Congress, said that selecting college students from workers and peasants with practical experience is the urgent demand of us poor and lower-middle peasants. Only by selecting those with red hearts and bright eyes and with practical experience to send to universities, studying for a few years, and then returning to practical production, can we truly grasp the power of science and technology in the hands of the working class and poor and lower-middle peasants. Lei Zhifu, a member of the Shaanxi Provincial Revolutionary Committee and a representative of the poor and lower-middle peasants of the Zhangyuan Brigade in Yan'an, said that the Anti-Japanese Military and Political University in Yan'an was a school that was very popular among the poor and lower-middle peasants. They placed the study of Chairman Mao's works and ideological transformation at the forefront. Chairman Mao once inscribed for the Anti-Japanese Military and Political University: "Now study while working, and in the future fight while working, this is the style of the Anti-Japanese Military and Political University, which can defeat any enemy!" Following Chairman Mao's teachings and latest instructions, running universities to emphasize proletarian politics and take the road of combining with the masses of workers and peasants can cultivate successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause who are both red and expert. We need such universities the most.

The soldiers of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army Navy said that some of the old universities in the past studied for many years, studying this and that, dozens of courses, making college students' minds full of formulas and data, the more they studied, the more they alienated from proletarian politics, alienated from reality, and alienated from the masses. Such universities are not needed by the working people at all. Zhang Chunyu, a hard-bone soldier of the Railway Corps, said that our proletarian universities must, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, take the Anti-Japanese Military and Political University as an example, learn from the experience of the People's Liberation Army in emphasizing proletarian politics, insisting on the Four Firsts, and carrying forward the Three-Eight Style, and run them into red universities of Mao Zedong Thought.

Only by cultivating college students according to Chairman Mao's latest instructions can we have the kind of college students that workers and peasants need.

The broad masses of workers and peasants across the country discussed heatedly the issue of what kind of college students we need and what kind we do not need while studying the latest instructions of the great leader Chairman Mao. They said that the road pointed out by Chairman Mao of "selecting students from workers and peasants with practical experience, studying at the school for a few years, and then returning to practical production" is the only correct road for cultivating new-type college students of socialism. We want to walk this road of college students, we want college students who are absolutely loyal to Chairman Mao, absolutely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and absolutely loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, we want college students who love workers, peasants, and labor, and we do not want those college students who look down on workers and peasants and think they are great!

Jiu Xiulan, the mother of Mao's good soldier Liu Yingjun and a poor peasant, said that Chairman Mao is the confidant of us poor and lower-middle peasants, who understands us poor and lower-middle peasants the most and knows what we need the most. We broad poor and lower-middle peasants are following Chairman Mao's brilliant teachings of "People's Communes are good" and striving to build a new socialist countryside, needing a lot of talents. However, we do not need those college students who alienate from proletarian politics, alienate from reality, and look down on laboring people. We need college students who are absolutely loyal to Chairman Mao, love the laboring people, and at the same time have certain scientific and technological and cultural knowledge, who understand both theory and labor.

Wang Xiuzhen, a leader of the Shanghai Workers' Revolutionary Rebel Headquarters, said that workers and poor and lower-middle peasants were oppressed and exploited in the old society, hating the old society the most, loving the new society the most, loving Chairman Mao the most, and being the most loyal to Mao Zedong Thought. They enter universities run according to Chairman Mao's teachings, study for a few years, and then return to practical production, and they will be both red and expert. Workers at the Guiyang Power Plant said that most of the technical personnel in our factory are graduates from universities and secondary specialized schools. Among these graduates, those from secondary specialized schools are better than those from universities. Some of them appeared in front of workers with the attitude of primary school students as soon as they entered the factory, without the airs of intellectuals.

However, some college students, even during their internship period, regarded themselves as "technical personnel" with a sense of entitlement. They attach great importance to fame and status, thinking they are great after studying for a few years. This is the evil fruit of the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line. We advise those college students who look down on workers and peasants and think they are great: you must remember Chairman Mao's teachings, humbly be the little students of the masses, be the "ox" of the people, use proletarian politics as the commander, use Mao Zedong Thought to transform yourselves, and quickly catch up with the majestic strides of hundreds of millions of revolutionary people!

The soldiers of the "Model Red Ninth Company for Studying Chairman Mao's Works" of the People's Liberation Army said that in the past, some college students came to our company to serve in the army and lived with us. Most of these college students were good after tempering, loving what our revolutionary soldiers love and hating what our revolutionary soldiers hate, sharing the same breath and destiny with us. But there were also a few college students whose thoughts and feelings were always different from ours. We revolutionary soldiers welcome the former type of college students and do not welcome the latter type. We not only want college students who can live with us and fight with us, but more importantly, we want college students who have the same thoughts and feelings as us. More importantly, we want college students who firmly hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, have relatively high political awareness, have distinct proletarian viewpoints and proletarian standpoints, have boundless love for comrades and boundless hatred for enemies, are public-spirited, seek no fame or gain, serve the people wholeheartedly, and dare to overcome difficulties. Such college students can only be cultivated by resolutely taking the road of combining with workers, peasants, and soldiers according to Chairman Mao's instructions.

We firmly support running universities according to Chairman Mao's latest instructions and will never be college students who alienate from the masses of workers and peasants and are "three-door" students.

Many revolutionary Red Guards in middle schools and universities across the country expressed their opinions on the education revolution of universities while studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions. They declared that they would definitely use Chairman Mao's latest instructions as their weapon, thoroughly bury the revisionist educational system, and let the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought fly high and forever fly high on the educational front!

The Red Guards of Shanghai No. 6 Middle School (formerly No. 6 Girls' School) said that in the past, we yearned to be college students, thinking that college students had a "high level" and "knowledge." In the unprecedented proletarian cultural revolution, we clearly realized that college students poisoned by the revisionist educational line had heavy heads, light feet, and shallow foundations. We deeply felt that universities not run according to Chairman Mao's educational line would only harm the youth. Such universities, we firmly oppose. They said that Chairman Mao's latest instructions have vividly depicted for us the blueprint of a new-type proletarian university. Such universities emphasize proletarian politics, take the road of political construction of the school, and forever hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought; the students of such universities come from the masses of workers and peasants, study, and then return to practical production, forever combining with the masses of workers and peasants. They are truly intellectuals of the working class, not "spiritual nobles" who stand above the masses. Such universities, we firmly support.

The revolutionary young people of Beijing Caochangdi Middle School, who have achieved certain results in the education revolution, boldly proposed eight requirements for the reform of university education: First, implement proletarian politics in command, that is, Mao Zedong Thought in command, take the Anti-Japanese Military and Political University personally founded by Chairman Mao as an example, learn from the People's Liberation Army, insist on the Four Firsts, and carry forward the Three-Eight Style. Second, open the door to workers, peasants, and soldiers, and resolutely follow Chairman Mao's instructions to select students from workers and peasants with practical experience. Third, take class struggle and line struggle as a main course, take ideological and political education as the central link, take the "Three Articles" as a motto, and make students have a worldview of wholeheartedly serving the people. Fourth, insist on self-reliance and thrift in running the school. Fifth, invite workers and peasants with practical experience to be teachers, implement joint preparation and teaching by worker-peasant-student teachers, mutual teaching and learning, and mutual progress in teaching. Sixth, take practice as the main activity in education, insist on sending students to factories and rural areas, and temper them in the three great revolutionary movements of class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experiment, thoroughly changing the phenomenon of theory alienating from practice. Seventh, shorten the school system, and strive for engineering and science students to return to industrial and agricultural practice in two or three years. Eighth, simplify the curriculum and thoroughly reform the textbooks, thoroughly discard the dogmas of feudalism, capitalism, and revisionism, and establish new textbooks with Mao Zedong Thought as the commander and theory combined with practice.

Many revolutionary Red Guards in middle schools and universities across the country said that the latest instructions of the great leader Chairman Mao have pointed out a revolutionary road for us to combine with workers, peasants, and soldiers and become ordinary laborers, blocking the dead end of peaceful evolution into bourgeois successors, which is Chairman Mao's greatest concern for us. We will never be "three-door" students from the home door to the school door and from the school door to the office door. We are determined to go to the countryside, go to the border, go to factories and mines, go to the grassroots, be workers and peasants for life, and in the three great revolutionary movements of class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experiment, temper ourselves into reliable successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause.

    毛主席的最新指示是无产阶级教育革命的伟大战斗纲领
    广大工农兵热切期望大学生们发扬理论和实际相结合的革命学风，迅速把毛主席的最新指示化为自己的实际行动，赶上亿万革命人民前进的雄伟步伐
    新华社二十五日讯　全国各地工农兵群众和广大革命的中学生和大学生，怀着无限热爱伟大领袖毛主席的无产阶级感情，怀着对无产阶级革命事业的高度责任感，反复地、认真地学习了毛主席关于教育革命的最新指示。他们根据毛主席的伟大教导，对于无产阶级的大学应该怎么办，对于无产阶级的大学生应该成为什么样的大学生，热烈地发表了意见。他们表示，一定要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，以毛主席的最新指示为武器，将教育革命进行到底，把我们的大学真正办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校，让我们的大学培养出来的大学生真正成为无产阶级革命事业的可靠接班人。
    广大革命群众热切地期望，大学生们要坚决执行毛主席的最新指示，迅速赶上亿万革命人民前进的雄伟步伐，和工农兵群众一起，切切实实地发扬毛主席倡导的理论和实际相结合的革命学风，深刻批判中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义教育路线，为彻底粉碎旧的资产阶级教育制度，创建出闪耀着毛泽东思想光辉的崭新的无产阶级教育制度而奋斗！
    只有按照毛主席的最新指示办大学
    才是我们工农兵群众所需要的大学
    伟大导师毛主席早就教导我们：“教育必须为无产阶级政治服务，必须同生产劳动相结合。劳动人民要知识化，知识分子要劳动化。”各地广大工农兵群众表示，一定要按照毛主席的一贯教导和最新指示，把我们的大学办成为无产阶级政治服务，同生产劳动相结合，密切联系群众的大学，为无产阶级革命事业培养出大批“有社会主义觉悟的有文化的劳动者”。
    江西南昌柴油机厂的工人们说，过去在中国赫鲁晓夫反革命修正主义教育路线的控制下的旧大学，资产阶级知识分子占据统治地位，把广大工人和贫下中农关在门外，脱离无产阶级政治，脱离实际，脱离群众，这种大学，我们工人阶级永远不需要。我们需要的是按毛主席的指示办的大学。这种大学“从有实践经验的工人农民中间选拔学生，到学校学几年以后，又回到生产实践中去”，这样才能真正培养起一支无限忠于毛主席的又红又专的科学技术队伍。毛主席当年亲手创建的革命老根据地模范乡——兴国县长冈公社长冈大队的社员们说，毛主席的最新指示，是无产阶级教育革命的导航灯，是实现知识分子劳动化、劳动人民知识化的伟大指南。按照毛主席的伟大指示办大学，学生从工农群众中来，又回到工农群众中去，才能培养出有无产阶级觉悟，拿起铁锤会做工，拿起锄头会种地，拿起笔杆会写文章的共产主义新人。我们贫下中农就是赞成这样的大学。
    天津第二棉纺厂的老工人说，旧大学是一个培养资产阶级接班人的大染缸，红的进去也会变成黑的。我们的大学只有坚决贯彻毛主席的无产阶级教育路线，走和工农兵相结合的道路，才能培养出思想觉悟高，不脱离集体劳动，为我们工人所拥护的新型大学生。狼牙山五壮士之一、河南省农代会委员宋学义说，从有实践经验的工人、农民中间选拔大学生，是俺贫下中农的迫切要求，只有选拔那些心红眼亮，又有实践经验的工人、农民送到大学里，学几年以后，又回到生产实践中去，才能把科技大权真正掌握在工人阶级和贫下中农手里。陕西省革命委员会委员、延安枣园大队的贫下中农代表雷治富说，当年延安的抗大就是个非常受贫下中农欢迎的学校，他们把学习毛主席的著作，进行思想改造，放在首位。毛主席曾经给抗大题词：“现在一面学习，一面生产，将来一面作战，一面生产，这就是抗大的作风，足以战胜任何敌人的！”遵照毛主席的这个教导和毛主席的最新指示，把大学办成突出无产阶级政治，走与工农群众相结合的道路的大学，就能培养出又红又专的无产阶级革命事业接班人。我们就最需要这样的大学。
    人民解放军海军某部指战员说，过去的一些高等学校，一学好几年，学这又学那，几十门课程，弄得大学生满脑子的公式、数据，越学越脱离无产阶级政治，脱离实际，脱离群众，这样的大学劳动人民根本不需要。铁道兵硬骨头战士张春玉说，我们无产阶级的大学，一定要在毛主席最新指示的指引下，以抗大为榜样，学习人民解放军突出无产阶级政治，坚持四个第一，发扬三八作风的经验，办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校。
    只有按照毛主席最新指示培养大学生
    才是我们工农兵群众所需要的大学生
    各地广大工农兵群众在学习伟大领袖毛主席最新指示的时候，就需要什么样的大学生，不需要什么样的大学生的问题，展开了热烈讨论。他们说，毛主席指出的“要从有实践经验的工人农民中间选拔学生，到学校学几年以后，又回到生产实践中去”的道路，是培养社会主义新型大学生的唯一正确的道路。我们就是要走这条道路的大学生，就是要无限忠于毛主席、无限忠于毛泽东思想、无限忠于毛主席革命路线的大学生，就是要热爱工农兵、热爱劳动的大学生，决不需要那种轻视工农兵的自以为很了不起的大学生！
    毛主席的好战士刘英俊的母亲、贫农社员朱秀兰说，毛主席是我们贫下中农的知心人，最了解我们贫下中农，最知道我们需要什么。我们广大贫下中农正在遵照毛主席“人民公社好”的光辉教导，努力建设社会主义新农村，需要很多人才。但是，我们需要的不是那种脱离无产阶级政治，脱离实际，瞧不起劳动人民的大学生。我们需要的是无限忠于毛主席，热爱劳动人民，同时具有一定科学技术和文化，既懂得理论又会劳动的新型大学生。
    上海工人革命造反总司令部领导成员王秀珍说，工人和贫下中农在旧社会受压迫、受剥削，对旧社会最恨，对新社会最爱，对毛主席最亲，对毛泽东思想最忠，又有丰富的实践经验。他们进了按毛主席教导去办的大学，经过几年学习，又回到生产实践中去，就会又红又专。贵阳发电厂的工人说，我们工厂的技术人员绝大部分都是大学和中等专科学校出来的。在这些毕业生中，中专的比大学的好，有些一进厂就以小学生姿态出现在工人面前，没有知识分子的架子。
    可是，有的大学生一进厂还在实习期间，就以“当然”的“技术员”自居。他们对名誉地位看得很重，读了几年书就觉得了不起。这是反革命修正主义教育路线造成的恶果。我们奉劝那些轻视工农，自以为了不起的大学生们：你们要牢记毛主席的教导，老老实实当群众的小学生，作人民大众的“牛”，用无产阶级政治挂帅，用毛泽东思想改造自己，迅速赶上亿万革命人民前进的雄伟步伐！
    人民解放军“学习毛主席著作的模范红九连”的指战员们说，过去，曾经有一些大学生来我们连当兵，和我们生活在一起。这些大学生经过锻炼，大部分都是好的，爱我们革命战士所爱，憎我们革命战士所憎，和我们同呼吸、共命运。但也有少数大学生，思想感情总是同我们不一样。我们革命战士欢迎前一种大学生，不欢迎后一种大学生。我们不仅要能够和我们生活在一起、战斗在一起的大学生，重要的是要和我们有共同思想感情的大学生。更重要的是，我们要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗的、政治觉悟比较高的大学生，要有鲜明的无产阶级观点和无产阶级立场的大学生，要对同志无限热爱、对敌人无比仇恨的大学生，要公而忘私、不为名、不为利、全心全意为人民服务的大学生，要不怕困难、敢于战胜困难的大学生。这样的大学生，只有按照毛主席的指示坚决走和工农兵结合的道路，才能培养出来。
  我们坚决支持按毛主席的最新指示办大学
  决不做脱离工农兵群众的“三门”大学生
    各地许多中学和大学的革命红卫兵小将，在学习毛主席的最新指示时，对大学的教育革命发表了许多意见。他们表示，一定要以毛主席的最新指示为武器，彻底埋葬修正主义教育制度，让毛泽东思想伟大红旗在教育战线上高高飘扬，永远飘扬！
    上海市第六中学（原第六女中）的红卫兵小将说，我们过去对于当大学生是向往的，认为大学生“水平高”，“有学问”。在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，我们清楚地认识到，受了修正主义教育路线毒害的大学生，头重脚轻根底浅。我们深深感到，不是按照毛主席的教育路线办的大学，只会坑害青年。这样的大学，我们坚决反对。他们说，毛主席的最新指示，为我们最鲜明地描绘出了无产阶级新型大学的蓝图。这种大学突出无产阶级政治，走政治建校的道路，永远高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗；这种大学的学生来自工农群众，学习以后又回到生产实践中去，永远和工农群众相结合。他们真正是工人阶级的知识分子，而不是高踞于群众头上的“精神贵族”。这样的大学，我们坚决拥护。
    在教育革命中已经做出一定成绩的北京草场地中学的革命小将，对大学的教育改革大胆地提出了八条要求：一、要实行无产阶级政治挂帅，也就是毛泽东思想挂帅，以毛主席亲手缔造的抗大为榜样，学习解放军，坚持四个第一，大兴“三八”作风。二、大门开向工农兵，坚决按照毛主席的指示，从有实践经验的工人农民中间选拔学生。三、要把阶级斗争、路线斗争作为一门主课，以思想政治教育作为中心一环，把“老三篇”作为座右铭，使学生要有全心全意为人民服务的无产阶级世界观。四、要坚持自力更生，勤俭办校。五、要请有实践经验的工人农民做老师，实行工农师生同备课，同讲课，互教互学，教学相长。六、教育活动要以实践为主，坚持让学生到工厂、农村中去，在阶级斗争、生产斗争、科学实验三大革命运动中锻炼，彻底改变理论脱离实际的现象。七、学制要缩短，理工科学生力求做到两三年就可以回到工农业实践中去。八、课程要精简，教材要彻底改革，要彻底抛弃封、资、修的教条，建立以毛泽东思想为统帅、理论联系实际的新教材。
    各地中学和大学的许多革命的红卫兵小将说，伟大领袖毛主席的最新指示为我们指出了一条与工农兵相结合，当普通劳动者的革命道路，为我们堵塞了和平演变成资产阶级接班人的死胡同，这是毛主席对我们最大的关怀。我们决不做从家门到校门、从校门到机关门的“三门”学生，下决心到农村去，到边疆去，到工矿去，到基层去，当一辈子工人农民，在阶级斗争、生产斗争、科学实验三大革命运动中，把自己锻炼成无产阶级革命事业的可靠接班人。
