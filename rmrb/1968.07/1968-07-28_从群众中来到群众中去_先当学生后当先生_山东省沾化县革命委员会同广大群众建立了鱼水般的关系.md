The revolutionary committee of Zhenhua County, Shandong Province, has followed the great leader Chairman Mao's teaching to "trust the masses, rely on the masses, and respect the masses' initiative." In their work, they have fully trusted the masses, firmly relied on the masses, and correctly handled relations with the masses. During the stormy class struggle, the members of the revolutionary committee and the broad revolutionary masses have established a fish-and-water relationship. The revolutionary committee has been continuously consolidated and developed, winning the praise of the broad poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary masses.

Only by completely and thoroughly trusting the masses can one be loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

Comrade Lin Biao pointed out: "Chairman Mao's line is one of letting the masses educate themselves and liberate themselves, a line of daring to do so, daring to trust the masses, daring to rely on the masses, and daring to mobilize the masses." In the practice of the struggle between the two lines, the Zhenhua County Revolutionary Committee has deepened its understanding of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and greatly increased its awareness of walking the mass line.

The story is as follows. Soon after the county revolutionary committee was established, a vice chairman, in order to quickly establish and improve the committee's working organs, invited a few people to draft a list, which was then announced at a county-level mass meeting. Before the meeting ended, the masses began to discuss and criticize this old method of a few people deciding everything.

The revolutionary committee attached great importance to the criticism from the masses. They believed that although this was a criticism of an individual leader, it was also a profound political lesson for all members of the committee. That very night, they held an expanded meeting of the standing committee of the revolutionary committee, studied Chairman Mao's teachings on the mass line, and used this incident as a living example for a small rectification campaign. Everyone agreed that to be loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, one must firmly trust the masses and insist on going to the masses and coming from the masses. The vice chairman who was criticized by the masses said with deep feeling: Through this study and discussion, I realized that only by consciously standing on Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line can one completely and thoroughly trust the masses. Only by completely and thoroughly trusting the masses can one be loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. After the meeting, he publicly criticized himself in a big-character poster for this incident. From then on, the members of the Zhenhua County Revolutionary Committee further strengthened their mass consciousness. Whether it was carrying out revolutionary criticism, waging struggles against the enemy, or promoting production while carrying out the revolution, they fully trusted the masses and mobilized them to take action.

Chairman Mao issued new instructions: "The basic experience of the revolutionary committees has three points: one is the representation of revolutionary cadres, one is the representation of the army, and one is the representation of the revolutionary masses, realizing the three-in-one combination of the revolution. The revolutionary committees should implement unified leadership, break down the redundant administrative organs, streamline the bureaucracy, and organize a revolutionary leadership cadre that is close to the masses." This points out the fundamental direction for the construction of revolutionary committees. The Zhenhua County Revolutionary Committee repeatedly studied this and decided to streamline the bureaucracy and reform the old administrative management organs. During this reorganization, they followed Chairman Mao's teaching that "in all practical work of our Party, correct leadership must come from the masses and go to the masses." First, a vice chairman of the revolutionary committee led an investigation team to conduct investigations and research in various county-level units, listening broadly to the opinions of the masses. After the standing committee of the county revolutionary committee summarized the opinions of the masses and drafted a preliminary plan for the reorganization, they again submitted it to the masses for discussion. Through thorough discussions from the bottom up and from the top down, the original forty redundant departments, commissions, bureaus, and offices of the county-level organs were all abolished, and the Political Department, Production Command Department, and Office were established, reducing the personnel of the county-level organs by about seventy percent compared to before.

After the reorganization, a large number of cadres formed Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams and went deep into the production front lines. Together with the poor and lower-middle peasants, they studied Mao Zedong Thought, carried out self-criticism and criticism of revisionism, worked, and promoted production while carrying out the revolution. The leaders of the revolutionary committee also further improved their work style, implemented a system of rotating duty among the standing committee members, and the other standing committee members and committee members all went deep into the grassroots and front lines. Together with the masses, they studied and applied Mao Zedong Thought, grasped class struggle, participated in labor, and strengthened their ties with the broad masses, winning the praise of the broad poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary masses.

Only by firmly relying on the masses can one follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments.

"Revolutionary war is the war of the masses; only by mobilizing the masses can one wage war, only by relying on the masses can one wage war." The Zhenhua County Revolutionary Committee, in leading the broad masses to study and apply Mao Zedong Thought, carry out revolutionary criticism, and wage struggles against the enemy, and in resolving contradictions among the two revolutionary mass organizations, firmly relied on the masses. Even in resolving the active thoughts among the leaders of the revolutionary committee, they relied closely on the masses. Their experience is: the masses are the true heroes. Only by firmly relying on the masses can one implement Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments, and consolidate and develop the revolutionary committees.

After establishing revolutionary committees at all levels throughout the county and achieving "one red area" everywhere, some members of the county and commune revolutionary committees developed a sense of complacency and negligence: they were satisfied with the good situation and did not see that the class enemies were still struggling desperately; some, although they discovered the activities of class enemies, were hesitant and afraid of making mistakes in the bourgeois reactionary line. If this thinking was not resolved in time, it would inevitably become an obstacle to carrying out struggles against the enemy. How to resolve it? The Zhenhua County Revolutionary Committee decided to follow Chairman Mao's teachings and rely on the masses to solve the problem. They first sent two vice chairmen to Yuhe Commune Yuhe Brigade, which had made outstanding achievements in deeply and persistently carrying out revolutionary criticism and actively attacking class enemies, to understand the new trends, characteristics, problems, and experiences of class struggle. Then, the members of the county revolutionary committee and the main members of the commune revolutionary committees held a Mao Zedong Thought study class in Yuhe Brigade. In the study class, the county and commune revolutionary committee members and commune members participated in struggles against the enemy, carried out revolutionary criticism, and studied Chairman Mao's teachings on class and class struggle together. With the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, they analyzed the new situation of class struggle, turning the study class into a battlefield for striking at class enemies and a classroom for self-education. Chairman Mao's teachings, the actual actions of the masses following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments, and the sharp and intense facts of class struggle quickly helped some members of the county and commune revolutionary committees overcome rightist conservative thinking and strengthened their class struggle consciousness.

In the struggle against the enemy, the county revolutionary committee discovered a trend: some units could see and grasp obvious enemies tightly and fight them fiercely, but could not see, grasp, or fight hidden enemies, affecting the depth of the movement. In response to this situation, some standing committee members of the county revolutionary committee, together with the main members of the commune revolutionary committees and some responsible comrades of the production brigades, went to Xiaowa Commune, which had some experience in digging out hidden class enemies, to hold a Mao Zedong Thought study class. Everyone studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions word by word and repeatedly: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is, in essence, a great political revolution carried out by the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes under the conditions of socialism, a continuation of the long-term struggle between the Communist Party of China and its leadership and the broad revolutionary masses and the Kuomintang reactionaries, and a continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie."

They also listened to the experiences of this commune and some production brigades in implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions, overcoming rightist conservative thinking, and digging out hidden special agents and counter-revolutionaries. The living facts greatly educated everyone. Some comrades said: Through this study class of relying on the masses to solve the problems of cadres' thinking, we have a deeper understanding of Chairman Mao's teaching of "first being a student and then a teacher." In the future, in any work, we must firmly rely on the masses.

Only by correctly handling relations with the masses can one establish a fish-and-water relationship with the broad masses.

The comrades of the Zhenhua County Revolutionary Committee believe that the revolutionary committee must not only trust the masses and rely on the masses but also correctly handle relations with the masses. Only by correctly handling relations with the masses can one establish a fish-and-water relationship with the broad masses. Whether or not one correctly handles relations with the broad masses is the fundamental difference between proletarian dictatorship and bourgeois dictatorship. What attitude one takes towards this question is a matter of stance, a matter of worldview, and a matter of attitude towards Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

In the rural areas of Zhenhua, a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party and other class enemies had once tried to sow discord and disrupt the unity of the revolutionary masses and spread the fallacies of "relying on the poor and lower-middle peasants is class originism, a bourgeois reactionary line," attempting to confuse the class line in the countryside.

Chairman Mao taught us: "Without the poor peasants, there would be no revolution. If you deny them, you deny the revolution. If you attack them, you attack the revolution." The Zhenhua County Revolutionary Committee used the sharp weapon of Mao Zedong Thought to smash the class enemies' plot to confuse the class line in the countryside and firmly relied on the broad poor and lower-middle peasants. In handling the problems between the two revolutionary mass organizations, they did not support one side and attack the other but organized them to hold good Mao Zedong Thought study classes, making them unite on the basis of Mao Zedong Thought and fight shoulder to shoulder against the enemy. Because the county revolutionary committee correctly handled relations with the masses, the entire county achieved universal great unity and the three-in-one combination of the revolution.

The Zhenhua County Revolutionary Committee believes that the revolutionary committee must correctly handle relations with the masses, it must correctly handle different opinions among the masses. If the revolutionary committee can often hear different opinions and often hear criticisms of its shortcomings and mistakes, the members of the committee can maintain a relatively clear mind, and if there are shortcomings and mistakes, they can be corrected more quickly. On the contrary, if one does not hear criticisms and different opinions, the revolutionary committee will be in danger of stagnation and detachment from the masses.

Chairman Mao recently pointed out: "Whether to protect or suppress the broad masses is the fundamental difference between the Communist Party and the Kuomintang, the fundamental difference between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, and the fundamental difference between proletarian dictatorship and bourgeois dictatorship." Chairman Mao's latest instructions point out a clearer direction for how revolutionary committees should correctly handle relations with the masses. Currently, the Zhenhua County Revolutionary Committee is summarizing the experiences of the previous period, determined to carry forward the achievements, overcome shortcomings, follow the course charted by Chairman Mao, advance victoriously, and achieve comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

    从群众中来到群众中去  先当学生后当先生
    山东省沾化县革命委员会同广大群众建立了鱼水般的关系
    本报讯　山东省沾化县革命委员会，遵照伟大领袖毛主席“要信任群众，依靠群众，尊重群众的首创精神”的教导，在工作中充分相信群众，坚决依靠群众，正确对待群众。在阶级斗争大风浪中，革委会成员和广大革命群众建立了鱼水般的关系，革委会得到不断巩固和发展，受到广大贫下中农和革命群众的好评。
      只有完全、彻底地相信群众，才
    能忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线
    林彪副主席指出：“毛主席的路线，是让群众自己教育自己，自己解放自己的路线，是‘敢’字当头的路线，是敢于相信群众，敢于依靠群众，敢于放手发动群众的路线。”沾化县革委会在两条路线的斗争的实践中，加深了对毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的理解，大大提高了坚持走群众路线的自觉性。
    事情是这样的。县革委会成立不久，一位副主任为了迅速建立和健全革委会办事机构，邀集了少数几个人，拟定了一个名单，并很快在县直属机关群众大会上宣布了。会还没散，群众就议论纷纷，对这种少数人说了算的老做法，提出了尖锐的批评。
    县革委会十分重视来自群众的批评。他们认为，这虽然是对个别领导成员的批评，也给革委会全体成员上了一堂极其深刻的政治课。他们当晚就召开革委会常委扩大会议，学习了毛主席有关群众路线的教导，以这件事为活教材，进行小整风。大家一致认为，忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，就要坚决相信群众，坚持从群众中来，到群众中去。受到群众批评的那位副主任深有体会地说：通过这次学习讨论，我认识到只有自觉地站在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线上，才能完全、彻底地相信群众。只有完全、彻底地相信群众，才能忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。会后，他用大字报就这件事向群众作了公开检讨。从此，沾化县革委会成员，群众观念进一步加强。不论搞革命的大批判、开展对敌斗争，还是抓革命促生产，都是充分相信群众，放手发动群众。
    毛主席发出最新指示：“革命委员会的基本经验有三条：一条是有革命干部的代表，一条是有军队的代表，一条是有革命群众的代表，实现了革命的三结合。革命委员会要实行一元化的领导，打破重叠的行政机构，精兵简政，组织起一个革命化的联系群众的领导班子。”为革命委员会的建设指出了根本方向。沾化县革委会反复进行了学习，决心实行精兵简政，改革旧的行政管理机构。在这次解决机构问题的时候，他们遵循毛主席“在我党的一切实际工作中，凡属正确的领导，必须是从群众中来，到群众中去”的教导，首先由革委会一名副主任带领调查组深入到县直属各单位进行调查研究，广泛倾听群众意见。县革委会常委集中群众意见，制订出改革机构的初步方案以后，又交群众讨论。经过自下而上、自上而下地认真讨论，原县直属机关的庞大重叠的四十个部、委、科、局、室全部撤销，建立了政治部、生产指挥部和办公室，使县直属机关的人员比原来减少了百分之七十左右。
    机构改革以后，大批干部组成毛泽东思想宣传队，深入生产第一线，和贫下中农一起学习毛泽东思想，一起斗私批修，一起劳动，一起抓革命促生产。革委会领导成员，也进一步改进作风，实行常委轮流值班制，其余的常委和委员都深入基层，深入第一线，同群众一起活学活用毛泽东思想，狠抓阶级斗争，参加生产劳动，加强了同广大群众的联系，得到了广大贫下中农和革命群众的好评。
        只有坚决依靠群众，才能紧跟
    毛主席的伟大战略部署
      “革命战争是群众的战争，只有动员群众才能进行战争，只有依靠群众才能进行战争。”沾化县革命委员会，在带领广大群众活学活用毛泽东思想，开展革命大批判和对敌斗争中，在解决两派革命群众组织的矛盾时，坚决依靠群众；就是解决革委会领导成员中的活思想，也紧紧依靠群众。他们的体会是：群众是真正的英雄，只有坚决依靠群众，才能贯彻执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，巩固和发展革命委员会。
    在全县建立起各级革命委员会，实现“一片红”以后，在县、社革委会成员中，有人产生了一种自满麻痹思想：满足于一片大好形势，看不到阶级敌人仍在垂死挣扎；有的虽然发现阶级敌人的活动，但“怕”字当头，怕犯资产阶级反动路线的错误。这种思想，如不及时解决，势必成为开展对敌斗争的障碍。怎样解决呢？沾化县革委会决心遵照毛主席的教导，依靠群众解决问题。他们首先派两名副主任到深入持久开展革命大批判、主动向阶级敌人进攻作出显著成绩的于河公社于河大队，了解阶级斗争的新动向、新特点、新问题、新经验。然后，县革委会成员和各公社革委会的主要成员，在于河大队举办了毛泽东思想学习班。在学习班里，县、社革委会的成员和社员一起参加对敌斗争，一起开展革命大批判，一起学习毛主席关于阶级和阶级斗争的论述，以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，分析当前阶级斗争的新形势，把学习班变成打击阶级敌人的战场，教育自己的课堂。毛主席的教导，群众紧跟毛主席伟大战略部署的实际行动，以及尖锐、激烈的阶级斗争的事实，使县、社革委会部分成员迅速克服了右倾保守思想，增强了阶级斗争观念。
    在对敌斗争中，县革委会又发现一种苗头，就是有的单位对比较明显的敌人看得见，抓得紧，斗得狠；对隐藏较深的敌人看不见，抓不紧，影响运动向纵深发展。针对这种情况，县革委会部分常委，再次带领各公社革委会和一部分生产大队的负责人，到挖暗藏的阶级敌人有了一定经验的下洼公社举办毛泽东思想学习班，大家逐字逐句地、反复地学习了毛主席的最新指示：“无产阶级文化大革命，实质上是在社会主义条件下，无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命，是中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续，是无产阶级和资产阶级阶级斗争的继续。”　
    他们还听取了这个公社和一部分生产大队落实毛主席最新指示，克服右倾保守思想，挖出暗藏的特务、反革命分子的经验。活生生的事实，使大家受到很大的教育。有的同志说：通过这种依靠群众解决干部思想问题的学习班，对毛主席的“先做学生，然后再做先生”的教导，有了更加深刻的认识。今后在任何工作中，都要坚定不移地依靠群众。
        只有正确对待群众，才能
    同广大群众建立鱼水关系
    沾化县革委会的同志认为，革命委员会不但要相信群众，依靠群众，还必须正确对待群众。只有正确对待群众，才能同广大群众建立鱼水般的关系。能否正确对待广大人民群众，这是无产阶级专政和资产阶级专政的根本区别。对这个问题持什么态度，是立场问题，是世界观问题，是对毛主席革命路线的态度问题。
    在沾化农村，党内一小撮走资派和其他阶级敌人，曾经极力挑拨和破坏革命群众的团结，并且散布“依靠贫下中农的提法是唯成份论，是资产阶级反动路线”等谬论，妄图搅乱农村的阶级阵线。
    毛主席教导我们：“没有贫农，便没有革命。若否认他们，便是否认革命。若打击他们，便是打击革命。”沾化县革委会用毛泽东思想这一锐利武器，粉碎了阶级敌人混淆农村阶级阵线的阴谋，坚定不移地依靠广大贫下中农。在处理两派革命群众组织之间的问题时，他们不是支持一派，打击一派，而是组织他们办好毛泽东思想学习班，使他们在毛泽东思想的基础上团结起来，并肩战斗，共同对敌。由于县革委会正确地对待群众，全县普遍实现了革命的大联合和革命的三结合。
    沾化县革委会认为，革命委员会要正确对待群众，就必须正确对待群众中的不同意见。革命委员会如果能经常听到不同意见，经常听到对自己工作中的缺点和错误的批评，这个革委会的成员就能保持比较清醒的头脑，有了缺点、错误，也能够改得快一点。相反，如果听不到批评，听不到不同意见，这个革命委员会就有停滞不前、脱离群众的危险。
    毛主席最近指出：“对广大人民群众是保护还是镇压，是共产党同国民党的根本区别，是无产阶级同资产阶级的根本区别，是无产阶级专政同资产阶级专政的根本区别。”毛主席的这一最新指示，为革命委员会如何正确对待群众，指出了更加明确的方向。目前，沾化县革命委员会正在总结前段经验，决心发扬成绩，克服缺点，沿着毛主席指引的航向，乘胜前进，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
