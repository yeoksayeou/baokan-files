Tanzania's first state-owned textile mill—the Friendship Textile Mill, built with Chinese aid—was officially completed at a grand ceremony held on the morning of July 6 in the Ubungo Industrial Zone on the outskirts of Dar es Salaam. Tanzanian President Julius Nyerere attended the completion ceremony and cut the ribbon.

That day, the mill was filled with a festive atmosphere. The national flags of Tanzania and China fluttered in front of the administrative building. Above the main entrance hung portraits of Mao Zedong, the great leader of the Chinese people, and President Nyerere. On the roof of the building, there were large banners reading "Long Live the Friendship Between the Peoples of Tanzania and China" and "Long Live the Unity of the Peoples of Africa and Asia."

More than three thousand people attended the ceremony, including Second Vice President Rashidi Kawawa, Speaker of the National Assembly Kaukwa, cabinet ministers, leaders of the Tanganyika African National Union, leaders of workers, youth, and women's organizations, National Assembly members, diplomats, and representatives of various African national liberation movements stationed in Dar es Salaam.

The Chinese Charge d'Affaires in Tanzania, Zhou Boqing, and other staff, as well as Chinese engineering and technical personnel who participated in the construction and installation of the mill, also attended the ceremony.

President Nyerere delivered a speech amidst enthusiastic applause. He said, "The completion of the Friendship Textile Mill indicates the progress we are making on the path of self-reliance."

President Nyerere said: "This textile mill belongs to Tanzania. It is our property and our responsibility. However, today we have this mill because we received aid from the People's Republic of China." "Therefore, on behalf of the entire Tanzanian people, I express our gratitude for this generous and effective aid."

The President recalled that in the past, Tanzania exported cotton to foreign countries and imported cloth. He continued, "By the end of this year, we will use almost all of our raw cotton for spinning and dyeing to supply cloth to the Tanzanian people—providing Kanga and other types of fabric." "In the past, foreign companies bought our cotton, processed it into finished products, and sold it back to us, profiting from the process. Now we will not let them do that anymore; we will gain the profits ourselves."

President Nyerere concluded: "Through the efforts of all the workers, this mill will play a significant role in the economic development of our country."

Earlier, Tanzanian Minister of Economic Affairs and Development Planning Bomani spoke. He expressed his thanks to the Chinese technical personnel and briefly introduced the mill. He said: "This mill, as its name Friendship Textile Mill indicates, is a symbol of the brotherly friendship that already exists between the peoples of the United Republic of Tanzania and the People's Republic of China, and it will greatly strengthen this brotherly friendship."

Chinese Charge d'Affaires Zhou Boqing, in his speech, extended warm congratulations to the Tanzanian people, praising their achievements in independent development of the national economy under the leadership of President Nyerere on the basis of self-reliance.

He said: "The completion of the Friendship Textile Mill is the result of the joint efforts of Chinese technical personnel, guided by the teachings of Chairman Mao, to serve the people of the world wholeheartedly, and the Tanzanian people. It is the crystallization of the fighting friendship between the two peoples."

Zhou Boqing also said that the rapid completion of this textile mill eloquently proves that once the peoples of Africa and Asia have cast off the shackles of imperialism and colonialism, they can display their wisdom and pioneering spirit, unite as one, overcome all difficulties, and build their own countries through self-reliance and hard work.

The general manager of the Friendship Textile Mill, Tando, presented President Nyerere with a piece of printed fabric produced by the mill and a photo album of the mill.

Following this, President Nyerere, accompanied by General Manager Tando and the head of the Chinese technical team, toured the mill. He showed great interest in inspecting the No. 1 Textile Factory, the Dyeing and Printing Factory, and some auxiliary workshops. He was warmly welcomed by the Chinese technical personnel and Tanzanian workers in these places. The President praised the Chinese technical personnel, saying that they were working under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought.

Many Tanzanian friends enthusiastically cheered the friendship between the peoples of Tanzania and China. They said: "This textile mill is a symbol of the friendship between the peoples of Tanzania and China." "It will greatly aid the independent development of Tanzania's national economy." "Only the Chinese people, guided by Mao Zedong Thought, can provide such sincere and selfless aid."

The newly completed Friendship Textile Mill is an integrated spinning, weaving, dyeing, and printing factory. The entire mill is divided into three factories, with forty thousand spindles and nine hundred seventy-eight looms, capable of producing twenty-four million square yards of printed fabric and dyed linen per year. The construction and machinery installation of the entire project were completed in less than two years, two months ahead of schedule, after the foundation was laid on July 29, 1966.

    中坦两国人民友谊的象征
    坦桑尼亚第一座国营纺织厂落成
    尼雷尔总统、卡瓦瓦第二副总统等出席落成仪式
    尼雷尔总统讲话感谢中国人民慷慨而有效的援助
    新华社达累斯萨拉姆电　坦桑尼亚第一座国营纺织厂——由中国援助建设的友谊纺织厂，六日上午在达累斯萨拉姆市郊乌邦果工业区举行的一个隆重仪式上宣告落成。坦桑尼亚总统尼雷尔出席了落成仪式，并且剪了彩。
    这天，在这个工厂里到处洋溢着节日的气氛。坦桑尼亚和中国的两国国旗在行政主楼前面飘扬。主要入口处的上面悬挂着中国人民的伟大领袖毛泽东主席的画像，悬挂着尼雷尔总统的画像。在大楼的屋顶上还张挂着“坦桑尼亚和中国人民友谊万岁”、“非洲和亚洲人民大团结万岁”的巨大横幅。
    出席这个落成仪式的共有三千多人，其中有第二副总统卡瓦瓦、国民议会议长姆克瓦瓦和内阁部长们，还有坦噶尼喀非洲民族联盟的负责人员，工人、青年和妇女等组织的领导人，国民议会议员，以及外交使节和驻在达累斯萨拉姆的各非洲民族解放运动的代表。
    中国驻坦桑尼亚大使馆临时代办周伯萍和其他工作人员以及参加这个工厂的建筑和安装工程的中国工程技术人员，也出席了仪式。
    尼雷尔总统在热烈的掌声中发表讲话。他说，友谊纺织厂的落成，“表明了我们在民族自力更生道路上正在取得的进展”。
    尼雷尔总统说：“这个纺织厂是属于坦桑尼亚的。它是我们的财产，也是我们的责任。但是今天有这个工厂，是由于我们得到了中华人民共和国的援助。”“因此，我代表我们坦桑尼亚全体人民，表示感谢这种慷慨而有效的援助。”
    总统回顾说，过去，坦桑尼亚向外国出口棉花，而从外国进口棉布。他接着说，今年年底，我们将把我们的几乎全部原棉都用来纺织、印染，向坦桑尼亚人民供应布料——提供康加维登其（非洲妇女穿的一种印花布）和其他许多种料子。“过去外国公司向我们购买棉花，然后制成成品，又卖还给我们，从中渔利，现在我们不让他们这样做了，我们要自己获得利润了。”
    尼雷尔总统最后说：“经过全体工人的努力，这座工厂将对我国的经济发展发挥巨大的作用。”
    在这以前，坦桑尼亚经济事务和发展计划部长博马尼讲了话。他向中国技术人员表示感谢，并简单地介绍了这座工厂。他说：“这座工厂，正如它的名称友谊纺织厂所表明的一样，是坦桑尼亚联合共和国和中华人民共和国两国人民之间已有的兄弟情谊的象征，并且将大大地进一步加强这种兄弟情谊。”
    中国临时代办周伯萍在讲话中向坦桑尼亚人民表示热烈祝贺，祝贺他们在尼雷尔总统领导下，在自力更生的基础上独立发展民族经济方面所取得的巨大成就。
    他说：“友谊纺织厂的建成，是按照毛主席的教导全心全意为世界人民服务的中国技术人员和坦桑尼亚人民共同努力的结果，是两国人民战斗友谊的结晶。”
    周伯萍还说，这个纺织厂的迅速建成，雄辩地证明了，非洲和亚洲人民一旦摆脱了帝国主义和殖民主义的枷锁，就能发挥他们的智慧和首创精神，团结一致克服种种困难，通过自力更生和艰苦工作，建设自己的国家。
    友谊纺织厂总经理坦度献给尼雷尔总统这个工厂所生产的印花布和这个工厂的照相册。
    接着，尼雷尔总统在总经理坦度和中国技术人员负责人等的陪同下，参观了这个工厂。他以很大的兴趣，视察了一号纺织厂、染印厂和一些辅助车间。他在这些地方受到了中国技术人员和坦桑尼亚工人的热烈迎接。总统赞扬中国技术人员说，他们是在毛泽东思想指导下工作的。
    许多坦桑尼亚朋友热烈欢呼坦中两国人民的友谊，他们说：“这个纺织厂是坦中两国人民友谊的象征。”“它将大大有助于坦桑尼亚民族经济的独立发展。”“只有受毛泽东思想教导的中国人民才能提供这种真诚无私的援助。”
    这个新落成的友谊纺织厂是一个纺、织、染、印联合工厂。全厂分三个厂，有四万枚纱锭，九百七十八台织机，每年能生产二千四百万平方码印花布和染色亚麻布。它是在一九六六年七月二十九日奠基的，整个建筑和机器安装工程比计划提前两个月，在不到两年的时间内完成。
