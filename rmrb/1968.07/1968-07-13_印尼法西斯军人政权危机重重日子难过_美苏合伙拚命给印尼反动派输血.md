The U.S. imperialists are intensifying their efforts to prop up the Indonesian fascist military regime, which brutally suppresses its people and kowtows to the U.S. The Soviet revisionist clique is also closely following suit. Currently, the U.S. government has become the largest creditor of the Indonesian fascist military regime. According to Western news agencies, on the 5th, the U.S. State Department issued a statement saying that the U.S. has decided to "provide Indonesia with $63 million in agricultural aid." This "aid," added to the $47 million provided in February, totals $110 million, accounting for more than one-third of the total "foreign aid" needed by the Indonesian reactionary regime this year. The statement said that the U.S. is "ready at any time" to provide more wheat and flour to the Indonesian fascist military regime this year. It said that the severely food-short Indonesian fascist military regime has launched a "campaign" to encourage the consumption of U.S. wheat products at home.

According to another report, U.S. Ambassador to Indonesia Green said on the 4th in Jakarta to the fascist military regime leader Suharto that in the first half of this year, the U.S. government had additionally provided Indonesia with more than $15 million in wheat "aid." He said that with this, the total amount of "aid" provided by the U.S. to Indonesia this year has already exceeded $125 million.

Hot on the heels of U.S. imperialism are the ambitious Japanese reactionaries. According to Kyodo News, the Sato reactionary government decided on the 2nd to provide the Indonesian fascist military regime with $110 million in "aid" this year. This decision made the Indonesian reactionary authorities overjoyed.

The Soviet revisionist clique is also unwilling to fall behind, closely following suit. According to reports, on the 4th, the Soviet revisionist ambassador to Indonesia, Sekyanko, and the Indonesian fascist military regime's foreign minister Malik signed an agreement in Jakarta to extend the repayment period for the $800 million military loan given by the Soviet revisionists to the Indonesian reactionary regime. Malik, overjoyed, said that the signing of this agreement has brought "Indonesia-Soviet relations into a new chapter." He said that the Soviet revisionists' agreement to extend Indonesia's debt repayment period means "great assistance from the Soviet Union to Indonesia" and also shows the "understanding" of the Soviet Union towards Indonesia's economy.

Soviet ambassador Sekyanko's speech thoroughly exposed the traitorous face of the Soviet revisionist ruling clique. He said without any disguise: "The Soviet Union has always considered strengthening relations with Indonesia to be important," and "the Soviet government is ready to provide political, economic, and financial assistance to Indonesia."

    印尼法西斯军人政权危机重重日子难过
    美苏合伙拚命给印尼反动派输血
    据新华社讯　雅加达消息：美帝国主义正在加紧给对内残暴镇压人民，对外投靠美帝的印尼法西斯军人政权打强心针，苏修叛徒集团也紧紧跟上。目前，美国政府成了印尼法西斯军人政权的最大债主。据西方通讯社透露，五日，美国国务院发表公告说，美国决定“以农产品形式向印尼提供六千三百万美元的援助”。这笔“援助”加上今年二月份提供的四千七百万美元，总数已达一亿一千万美元，占今年印尼反动政权所需“外援”总数的三分之一以上。公告说，美国“还随时准备”在今年向印尼法西斯军人政权提供更多的小麦和面粉。它说，严重缺粮的印尼法西斯军人政权在国内发动了一个“鼓励”吃美国小麦产品的运动。
    另据报道，美国驻印尼大使格林四日在雅加达对法西斯军人政权头目苏哈托说，今年上半年，美国政府还额外向印尼提供了一千五百多万美元的小麦“援助”。他说，这样，今年美国向印尼提供的“援助”总额已经超过一亿二千五百万美元。
    紧跟美帝国主义脚步的是野心勃勃的日本反动派。据共同社透露，日本佐藤反动政府二日决定今年向印尼法西斯军人政权提供一亿一千万美元“援助”。这个决定使印尼反动当局欢喜若狂。
    苏修叛徒集团也不甘落后，紧紧跟上。据报道，四日，苏修驻印尼大使塞坚科和印尼法西斯军人政权外交部长马利克在雅加达签订了关于延长偿还苏修给印尼反动政权的八亿美元军事贷款期限的议定书。马利克兴高采烈地说，这个议定书的签订，使“印尼和苏联的关系进入了新的篇章”。他说，苏修“同意印尼延期偿还它的债务意味着苏联（对印尼）的巨大援助，同时也表明（苏联）对印尼经济的谅解”。
    苏修大使塞坚科在讲话中彻底暴露了苏修统治集团的叛徒嘴脸。他毫不掩饰地说：“苏联始终认为加强同印尼的关系是重要的”，“苏联政府准备（向印尼）提供政治、经济和财政援助”。
