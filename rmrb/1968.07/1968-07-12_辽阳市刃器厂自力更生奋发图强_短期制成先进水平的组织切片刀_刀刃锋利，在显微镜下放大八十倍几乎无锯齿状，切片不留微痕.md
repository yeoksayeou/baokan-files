Liaoyang City Blade Factory, with the strong support of the People's Liberation Army 201 Hospital, has raised high the banner of the revolutionary criticism of Mao Zedong Thought. With the spirit of "seizing the day," they have produced, in a short period, a tissue sectioning knife of modern advanced level. This is an important achievement of Liaoyang City Blade Factory's workers in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

This type of tissue sectioning knife is used in the study of animal and plant tissues, embryos, pathology, and other fields. Especially in the field of pathology, tissue sectioning is an indispensable scientific method in modern medical practice. It requires the tissue sectioning knife to have a very high precision and be extremely sharp, not only able to cut tissue slices as thin as five microns to one micron (about one-seventh the thickness of a hair), but also to ensure that the cut slices do not curl, wrinkle, or break.

Great Leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "The Chinese people have spirit, have ability, and will definitely catch up with and surpass the world's advanced level in the not-too-distant future." Liaoyang City Blade Factory was originally a small factory that only produced sickles and kitchen knives and had never manufactured such extremely sharp blades. After the start of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the revolutionary workers of the Blade Factory, with the strong support of the People's Liberation Army 201 Hospital, actively studied and applied Mao Zedong Thought. They carried out a revolutionary criticism of the revisionist line of servility and the "crawling philosophy" promoted by China's Khrushchev and other capitalist roaders within the Party in the field of scientific and technological development. They demonstrated a spirit of self-reliance, striving for strength, hard work, and practical effort. Overcoming difficulties in the lack of data, technical equipment, and other aspects, they used domestically produced steel and, in just three months, successfully developed this tissue sectioning knife of modern advanced level. After more than a year of trials by over ten medical units, it was proven that the tissue sectioning knife produced by Liaoyang City Blade Factory has a quality that completely catches up with the imported ones of the same type. Compared with a certain imported tissue sectioning knife, the advantages of this knife are: easy to sharpen and quick, durable, with a sharp blade that, when magnified 80 times under a microscope, shows almost no serrations, and cuts slices without leaving any micro-scars.

Great Leader Chairman Mao pointed out: "The growth of any new thing is bound to encounter twists and turns." In the process of developing the tissue sectioning knife, class enemies spread rumors and tried to sabotage the development work. Revolutionary workers, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, smashed the plots of the class enemies and persevered even more tenaciously in the development work. In the development process, they tested 38 kinds of steel before determining the blade material. After more than 20 trials of forging, heat treatment, and other processes, they finally successfully produced the first tissue sectioning knife. Doctors and technicians from the pathology department of the People's Liberation Army 201 Hospital, through a pathology cooperation meeting, conducted on-site identification of the newly developed tissue sectioning knife. When this knife cut out complete slices of five microns, four microns, and even one micron, the audience was excited and repeatedly shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand ten thousand years!"

    短期制成先进水平的组织切片刀
    刀刃锋利，在显微镜下放大八十倍几乎无锯齿状，切片不留微痕
    新华社沈阳十日电 辽宁省辽阳市刃器厂在人民解放军二○一医院的大力帮助下，高举毛泽东思想的革命批判大旗，用“只争朝夕”的战斗精神，在短期内制成了具有现代先进水平的组织切片刀。这是辽阳市刃器厂工人在无产阶级文化大革命中所取得的一个重要成果。
    这种组织切片刀，应用于研究动植物、组织胚胎、病理等方面的组织切片。特别是病理方面的组织切片，是现代医疗事业上一种必不可少的科学方法。它要求组织切片刀有很高精度，非常锋利，不仅能切只有五微米到一微米（约一根头发丝的七十分之一）薄的组织片，而且要使切出的薄片不打卷、不皱折、不破片。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“中国人民有志气，有能力，一定要在不远的将来，赶上和超过世界先进水平”。辽阳市刃器厂过去是一个只生产镰刀和菜刀的小工厂，从来没有制造过这种触发即断的锋利刃器。无产阶级文化大革命开始后，刃器厂的革命职工在人民解放军二○一医院的大力帮助下，活学活用毛泽东思想，对中国赫鲁晓夫等党内一小撮走资派在科学技术发展上推行的奴隶主义、“爬行哲学”等反革命修正主义路线开展革命的大批判，发扬自力更生、奋发图强、苦干实干的革命精神，克服没有资料、数据和技术设备上的困难，采用国产钢材，在短短的三个月内就试制成了这种具有现代先进水平的组织切片刀。经十多个医疗单位一年多的试用证明，辽阳市刃器厂制成的这种组织切片刀，质量完全赶上现在进口的同类组织切片刀。拿这种切片刀同进口的一种组织切片刀对比，这种组织切片刀的优点是：好磨易快，耐用，刀刃锋利，在显微镜下放大八十倍几乎无锯齿状，切片不留微痕。
    伟大领袖毛主席指出：“任何新生事物的成长都是要经过艰难曲折的。”辽阳市刃器厂在试制组织切片刀的过程中，阶级敌人煽阴风，点邪火，散布种种流言蜚语，破坏切片刀的试制工作。革命工人高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，粉碎了阶级敌人的阴谋诡计，更加顽强地坚持试制工作。他们在试制中，选用过三十八种钢材，才确定了刀料，又经过锻造、热处理等二十多次试验，终于胜利地制成了第一把组织切片刀。人民解放军二○一医院病理科的医生和技术员，通过病理协作会议为新制的组织切片刀作了现场鉴定。当这把刀切出五微米、四微米直至一微米的完整薄片时，会场上群情振奋，连连高呼：“毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！”
