New Zealand Communist Party General Secretary Wilcock writes an article discussing Chairman Mao's great development of dialectical materialism

July 16th, Xinhua News Agency reports: In a June issue of the "New Zealand Communist Review," General Secretary Wilcock of the New Zealand Communist Party published an article titled "Learning from Chairman Mao's New Contributions to Dialectics." The detailed summary is as follows:

Today, all Marxist-Leninists generally recognize that Mao Zedong is the great leader of our world movement. His thoughts and practices are not only significant in China but have universal significance. He is the Lenin of the era when imperialism is finally defeated worldwide and socialism achieves global victory. This victory has not yet come, but it is now on the agenda. Based on the rich heritage of previous Marxism, Mao Zedong's theory and practice are the guiding light towards this victory.

Mao Zedong has developed and enriched Marxist-Leninist theory in many aspects. Therefore, studying his works—the new aspects of Marxism-Leninism he has developed—is the primary task of all communist revolutionaries. Without studying his works and applying them to local conditions, one cannot advance, cannot win, and will instead fall into the path of revisionism.

Today we can say that the criterion for a Marxist-Leninist is how they evaluate Mao Zedong's theory and practice. When someone proposes studying Mao Zedong Thought, one should not retreat and say we need to wait. We must learn and master the fundamental core of the new developments in Marxist theory to apply it to the situation in New Zealand. Through study, we will realize that Mao Zedong has elevated theory to a new stage that suits our era, the era of the increasing failure of U.S.-led world imperialism.

The article points out: Of course, we should not abandon the past heritage of Marxism-Leninism. No one proposes this, and Mao Zedong least of all advocates it; but we must move forward and learn new theories, because without doing so, we cannot carry forward the great work of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin.

For this reason, the political report adopted last November emphasized that the party must immediately launch a study of the various aspects of Mao Zedong's most important theoretical works; and now, after the necessary preparatory work, we are beginning the study of Mao Zedong's great theoretical works "On Contradiction" and "On Practice" throughout the entire party at all levels.

This study will enable us to see Mao Zedong's tremendous new developments in his understanding of Marxist dialectical materialism. This is a starting point from which he has proposed various new concepts and strategies in a very broad field.

Lenin once said: "Dialectics, properly understood, is the study of the contradictions inherent in the very essence of objects." (Philosophical Notebooks)

The article points out: It is precisely in this aspect that Mao Zedong has made significant contributions: he has thoroughly broken away from the mechanical interpretation of dialectical materialism, which has led many good people into a spiritual dead end.

Mao Zedong said that in Marxist-Leninist dialectics there is a fundamental law, which is the law of contradiction, the law of the unity of opposites. He proposed the concept of distinguishing between antagonistic and non-antagonistic contradictions, which led him to write the brilliant work "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People."

The article criticizes Soviet modern revisionism, pointing out that capitalism has been restored in the Soviet Union. The article then points out: In China, under Mao Zedong's leadership, the situation is the opposite. By firmly adhering to the fundamental law of Marxist dialectics—the law of the unity of opposites, the law of contradiction—it has long been recognized that class struggle still exists in socialist society. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution was launched from this recognition.

After discussing Chairman Mao's great contributions to Marxist-Leninist dialectical materialism, the article points out: I believe that special attention should be paid to Mao Zedong's advocacy of various different forms of struggle, that is, the distinction between antagonistic and non-antagonistic contradictions.

When we fully grasp this point in New Zealand, we will truly advance on the path to victory in our overall political line and in the comprehensive struggle to build a socialist New Zealand.

Only by understanding dialectical materialism, especially by understanding the role of the fundamental law of contradiction, can we make appropriate assessments of the international situation, of the state of New Zealand and class relations, and of our party and its problems. With this understanding, we will not harbor any illusions about peaceful transition, peaceful imperialism, the parliamentary road, and all other slogans from the revisionist camp.

It is now clear that the criterion for Marxist-Leninists in Western countries, who have long experience with bourgeois democracy and limited legal freedoms, is how they deal with the issue of the inevitable suppression by the ruling class in its death throes, which will eventually strangle all freedoms and legal rights.

If he is a revolutionary and not just a windbag using Marxist phrases, he must now strive to prepare to defeat the class enemy and win the victory of socialism.

The new developments in Marxist-Leninist theory, so clearly and profoundly expounded by Mao Zedong, have strengthened the confidence of all those who understand these new developments and have shown us how to fight now and how to prepare for greater battles in the future.

There is no better starting point than studying Mao Zedong's great work "On Contradiction."

The article concludes: It is precisely by applying the major law of Marxist dialectical materialism, the law of contradiction, that Mao Zedong has been able to propose in practice the theory of people's war, especially the issue of the army under the leadership of the party. Before Mao Zedong, no great Marxist-Leninist had systematically studied this problem, but Mao Zedong concluded that without an army, the people are tied hand and foot when they enter the battle, and he believed that how to build such an army is now an urgent problem for all Marxist-Leninists in the world. But what is the reaction? Look at our revisionists, those who shout Marxist phrases, when the slogan "political power grows out of the barrel of a gun" is raised, they hide. They are cowardly, insignificant figures who are afraid of imperialism, who think imperialism is so strong that they must compromise with it, and who in fact have joined the imperialist camp and do not believe that all imperialists are "paper tigers."

The article states: Mao Zedong's theory of people's war is being increasingly successfully applied in practice. These theories are international Marxist-Leninist theories, not theories applicable only to the Chinese situation.

The article states: During the period of the New Democratic Revolution, Mao Zedong insisted on the independence of the Communist Party within the united front in China. Mao Zedong is correct. This is because Mao Zedong's concept is based on correctly handling contradictions.

The article concludes: There are many more examples that can be cited to show that Mao Zedong's thought is a new development and is correct, but due to space limitations, I cannot write more. Let me just remind you of Mao Zedong's method, which is based on the concept: theory comes from practice, and higher-level practice comes from theory. This is the path forward.

    学习毛主席对辩证法的新贡献
    新西兰共产党总书记威尔科克斯同志发表文章，论述毛主席对辩证唯物主义的伟大发展
    新华社十六日讯　新西兰共产党总书记威尔科克斯同志在六月间出版的一期《新西兰共产主义评论》上发表一篇文章，题目是《学习毛主席对辩证法的新贡献》，详细摘要如下：
    今天马克思列宁主义者都普遍认为，毛泽东是我们的世界运动的伟大领袖，他的思想和实践不仅在中国有意义，而且具有普遍的意义。他是在帝国主义在全世界范围内最后失败，社会主义取得全世界的胜利的时代的列宁。这个胜利尚未到来，但是它现在已经列到日程上来了。在以前的马克思主义的丰富遗产的基础上建立起来的毛泽东的理论和实践是走向这个胜利的指路明灯。
    毛泽东在许多方面发展和丰富了马克思列宁主义理论，因此，学习他的著作——他所发展的马克思列宁主义的新的方面——是所有共产主义革命者的首要任务。不学习他的著作，并接着将其应用到本国的当地条件，就不能前进，不能胜利，反而要走到修正主义的邪路上去。
    今天我们可以说，检验一个马克思列宁主义者的标准，就是看他如何评价毛泽东的理论和实践。在有人提议学习毛泽东思想的时候，就不应该退缩，不应该说我们还要等待。我们必须学习掌握马克思主义理论的新发展的根本核心，以便将其应用于新西兰的情况。通过学习将使我们认识到，毛泽东把理论提高到同我们生活的时代，即以美国为首的世界帝国主义日益失败的时代相适应的新阶段。
    文章指出：当然，我们不该丢掉马克思列宁主义过去的遗产。没有人提出这种主张，毛泽东最不主张这样做；但是我们必须前进，必须学习新理论，因为不这样，我们就不能把马克思、恩格斯、列宁和斯大林的伟大工作发扬光大。
    正是由于这个原因，去年十一月获得通过的我党政治报告强调指出，必须立即开展党对毛泽东的最重要的理论著作的各个方面的学习；而现在我们经过必要的入门准备之后，在我们整个党内的各级开始进行毛泽东的伟大理论著作《矛盾论》和《实践论》的学习。
    这个学习将使我们看到毛泽东对于马克思主义的辩证唯物主义的理解的巨大的新发展。这是一个起点，从这个起点出发，他在一个非常宽广的领域内提出了各种新的概念、新的策略。
    列宁曾说过：“就本来的意义说，辩证法就是研究对象的本质自身中的矛盾。”（《哲学笔记》）
    文章指出：正是在这方面，毛泽东作出了重大的贡献：他彻底破除了对辩证唯物主义的机械的阐述，而这种机械的阐述把许多好人引入精神上的死胡同。
    毛泽东说，在马克思列宁主义的辩证法中有一个根本的法则，这就是矛盾法则，即对立统一的法则。他提出了区别对抗性矛盾和非对抗性矛盾的概念，这个提法使他在以后写出了光辉的著作《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》。
    文章批判了苏联现代修正主义，指出了在苏联已经复辟资本主义。文章接着指出：在中国，在毛泽东的领导下，情况则恰恰相反。由于坚定地依照马克思主义辩证法的根本法则——对立的统一法则，即矛盾法则，早就认识到这一事实：在社会主义社会中阶级斗争依然存在。无产阶级文化大革命，就是从这样的认识出发发动起来的。
    文章阐述了毛主席对马克思列宁主义唯物辩证法所作出的伟大贡献后指出：我认为，应该特别注重毛泽东关于各种不同的斗争形式，即区别对抗性矛盾和非对抗性矛盾的主张。
    当我们在新西兰全面地掌握了这个论点，我们就将在我们的总的政治路线方面，在为建立一个社会主义的新西兰的全面斗争中，真正地在胜利的道路上前进。
    只有我们理解了辩证唯物主义，特别是理解了矛盾这个根本法则的作用，我们才能够对国际形势、对新西兰的状况和阶级关系、对我们党和它的问题作出适当的估计。有了这种理解，我们就不会对和平过渡、和平帝国主义、议会道路以及来自修正主义阵营的所有其他口号抱什么幻想。
    现在很明显，检验有着资产阶级民主和有限的合法自由的长期经历的西方国家的马克思列宁主义者的标准，就是看他怎样对待统治阶级在垂死挣扎时进行的镇压不可避免地总有一天要达到扼杀一切自由和合法权利的地步这个问题。
    如果他是一个革命者，而不只是一个使用马克思主义词句的空谈家，他现在就要努力进行准备，准备战胜阶级敌人，赢得社会主义的胜利。
    毛泽东如此简明、如此深刻地阐述的马克思列宁主义理论的新发展，使所有理解了这些新发展的人加强了信心，并给我们指明现在怎样进行斗争，怎样准备在将来进行更大的战斗。
    再也没有比学习毛泽东的伟大著作《矛盾论》有更好的开端。
    文章在结论中说：正是由于应用了马克思主义的辩证唯物主义的主要法则，矛盾法则，毛泽东才能够在实践中提出了人民战争的理论，特别是阐述了党领导下的军队的问题。在毛泽东以前，任何一个伟大的马克思列宁主义者都不曾系统地研究过这个问题，然而毛泽东得出结论说，没有一支军队，人民在投入战斗时双手是被缚住的，而且他认为，怎样来建立这样一支军队，现今是全世界马克思列宁主义者的一个紧急的问题。然而反应如何呢？看一看我们的修正主义者，那些空喊马克思主义词句的人们，当着提出“枪杆子里面出政权”的口号时，他们躲了起来。他们是一些害怕帝国主义，认为帝国主义如此强大必须同它妥协，事实上是参加了帝国主义阵营，不相信一切帝国主义都是“纸老虎”的胆怯的渺小人物。
    文章说：毛主席关于人民战争的理论，正在日益成功地应用于实践。这些理论是马克思列宁主义的国际性的理论，而不是只适用于中国情况的理论。
    文章说：在新民主主义革命时期，毛泽东在中国坚持在统一战线内部共产党的独立自主。正确的是毛泽东。这是因为毛泽东的概念是以正确处理矛盾为依据的。
    文章最后说：还可以举出许多例子说明毛泽东思想是新发展，是正确的，但是由于篇幅限制，不能多写。让我仅提醒你们注意毛泽东的方法，这个方法是依据这样的概念：从实践产生理论，而从理论产生更高级的实践。这就是前进的道路。
