Vietnamese Ambassador Holds Press Conference for Chinese and Foreign Journalists

New China News Agency, July 22nd: The Ambassador of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam to China, Vuong Thuy Lan, held a press conference for Chinese and foreign journalists in Beijing today. He distributed a call to arms issued by Chairman Ho Chi Minh on July 20, 1968, to the military and people of Vietnam.

Ambassador Vuong Thuy Lan said at the press conference that Chairman Ho Chi Minh's call to arms on July 20, 1968, has brought new strength to the military and people of Vietnam to advance more bravely. Just like a battle cry, the call to arms is urging the 31 million people of Vietnam to advance victoriously, to launch fierce and continuous attacks, and to ultimately achieve final victory.

Ambassador Vuong Thuy Lan strongly condemned the U.S. imperialists' aggression against Vietnam. He emphasized that the U.S. imperialists must stop their aggression against Vietnam, must stop bombing and strafing North Vietnam, and must withdraw all U.S. and puppet troops from South Vietnam. Vietnam belongs to the Vietnamese people.

Ambassador Vuong Thuy Lan said, "The people of Vietnam are resolutely implementing Chairman Ho's call: 'Our entire nation, north and south, is united in resolute resistance, determined to defeat the U.S. aggressors, liberate the south, defend the north, and ultimately achieve peaceful reunification of the motherland.'"
