Protests on the streets, burning of shops, smashing of police cars, and assaults on police officers. Black people in some American cities have launched another wave of anti-violence struggles.

More than ten thousand electric workers in Illinois have been on strike for seventy-one days.

	New York, July 19th — A Xinhua News Agency report from Washington: Black residents in Akron, an industrial city in Ohio, have launched an anti-violence struggle, protesting against fascist police who shot and injured a black person.

	From the evening of the 17th to the morning of the 18th, large groups of angry black people took to the streets, throwing Molotov cocktails at shops and other buildings in the commercial district, and smashing police cars and shop windows with bottles and stones.

	The police released tear gas and brutally arrested forty-five protesters, but they could not extinguish the flames of the black struggle. The reactionary municipal authorities were in a panic, quickly dispatching seven hundred members of the "National Guard" to strengthen the suppression, and simultaneously declaring a state of emergency in the city on the 18th, implementing a curfew at night.

	In York City, Pennsylvania, there were sporadic black anti-violence struggles for five consecutive days from the 12th to the 16th. In Stockton, California, a group of angry black people attacked four reactionary police officers who were deliberately provoking them on the 16th.

	New York, July 17th — A Xinhua News Agency report from Washington: More than eleven thousand eight hundred electric installation workers at the Bell Telephone Company in Illinois have been on strike since May 8th, lasting seventy-one days, dealing a severe blow to American monopoly capital.

	Due to this large-scale strike, the wireless and television installation work scheduled to be completed by the end of August in Chicago, Illinois, for the Democratic National Convention, has been forced to stop completely. The panicked Democratic Party leaders lamented that if the strike continues, the Democratic Party's convention will not be able to be held in Chicago. (Accompanying picture)

    伊利诺斯州一万多电气工人已坚持罢工七十一天
    新华社十九日讯　华盛顿消息：美国俄亥俄州工业城市阿克伦的黑人群众掀起一场抗暴斗争，抗议法西斯警察开枪打伤黑人。
    从十七日晚上到十八日早晨，大群大群愤怒的黑人涌上街头，向闹区商店和其他建筑物投掷燃烧瓶，用玻璃瓶和石块砸警车和商店橱窗。
    警察施放催泪瓦斯，并且横蛮逮捕了四十五名示威者，但无法扑灭黑人斗争的烈火。反动的市政当局惊慌失措，赶紧调拨七百名“国民警卫队”加强镇压，同时在十八日宣布全城处于紧急状态，晚上实行宵禁。
    在宾夕法尼亚州的约克城，从十二日到十六日接连五天都有零星的黑人抗暴斗争。加利福尼亚州的斯托克顿，一群愤怒的黑人群众十六日袭击了向黑人故意寻衅的四名反动警察。
    新华社十七日讯　华盛顿消息：美国伊利诺斯州贝尔电话公司一万一千八百名电气安装工人，从五月八日开始举行的大罢工已经坚持了七十一天，给了美国垄断资本以严重的打击。
    由于这次大罢工，预定八月底要在伊利诺斯州芝加哥市召开的美国民主党全国代表大会的无线电和电视安装工程被迫完全停止施工。惊慌失措的民主党头子哀叹，如果罢工再继续坚持下去，民主党的代表大会将无法在芝加哥举行。（附图片）
