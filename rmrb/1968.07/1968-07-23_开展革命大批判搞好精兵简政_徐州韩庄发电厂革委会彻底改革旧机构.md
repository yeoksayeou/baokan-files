The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "Revolutionary committees should implement unified leadership, break down redundant administrative structures, streamline and downsize, and organize a revolutionary leadership team that is closely connected with the masses." Under the assistance of the People's Liberation Army support team stationed at the factory, the revolutionary committee of the Han Zhuang Power Plant of the Xuzhou Electric Power Bureau in Jiangsu Province has, in conjunction with launching a revolutionary criticism campaign and purging class enemies, implemented streamlining and efficiency, thoroughly reformed the old administrative structures, consolidated and developed the revolutionary committee organizationally, and further enhanced the power of the revolutionary government.

After the revolutionary committee of the Han Zhuang Power Plant was established on April 1, it decided to thoroughly reform the old structures and implement streamlining and efficiency. How to reform? There was no ready-made plan. The committee members went deep into the masses to widely solicit opinions from the broad masses. After two years of tempering during the Cultural Revolution, the revolutionary masses had long been extremely resentful of the old administrative structures and their management systems. They firmly supported and endorsed breaking down redundant administrative structures, streamlining and efficiency, and implementing unified leadership. Everyone enthusiastically shared their views and proposed plans. Through extensive discussions, the outline of the new plan had basically taken shape. The committee members collected and organized these opinions, referred to some advanced experiences from other units, and drafted a relatively reasonable new plan, transforming the original dozen or so departments into "three groups and one office" (i.e., the Political Work Group, the Production and Construction Group, the Logistics Service Group, and the Committee Office). Practice has proven that this reform has played a significant role in overcoming bureaucratic old habits and establishing a style of work that is closely connected with the masses.

While reforming the factory-level structures, the leadership structures of the workshops and teams were also reformed. At the workshop level, non-full-time three-in-one leadership teams were established. The workshop three-in-one leadership teams not only unify the leadership of the revolutionary and production work in each workshop but also divide responsibilities for the revolutionary and production leadership in their respective teams, achieving unified leadership. They live, work, study, and fight together with the team workers every day, being both "officials" and "common people," greatly promoting the revolutionization of people's thinking.

Implementing streamlining and efficiency is a sharp and profound class struggle. A small handful of class enemies constantly fanned the flames of sabotage. They told some of the original departmental cadres: "You are no longer needed, pack your things and wait." They attempted to sow discord between the revolutionary masses and the revolutionary committee, inciting the masses to resist the implementation of streamlining and efficiency. The revolutionary committee firmly remembered Chairman Mao's great teaching of "never forget class struggle," and in conjunction with launching a revolutionary criticism campaign and purging class enemies, it firmly, accurately, and resolutely struck down a small handful of traitors, spies, unrepentant capitalist roaders, and untransformed landlords, rich farmers, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists. It mobilized the broad masses to expose their crimes and promptly foiled their sabotage plots, ensuring the smooth progress of the streamlining and efficiency work.

After streamlining the structures, the revolutionary enthusiasm of the workers soared to unprecedented heights, and the entire factory was filled with a vibrant new atmosphere. The staff of various levels of leadership organs generally went to the front lines of production, timely understanding and solving problems in revolution and production. During a major overhaul, the revolutionary workers broke free from the constraints of old frameworks and completed the overhaul task eight days ahead of schedule, with the main data setting new records. The coal management team previously had six full-time personnel who were still not enough, but now no one is detached from production, and work efficiency has increased several times over.

    开展革命大批判搞好精兵简政
    徐州韩庄发电厂革委会彻底改革旧机构
    本报讯　伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“革命委员会要实行一元化的领导，打破重叠的行政机构，精兵简政，组织起一个革命化的联系群众的领导班子。”江苏省徐州电业局韩庄发电厂革命委员会，在驻厂解放军支左人员帮助下，结合开展革命大批判，清理阶级队伍，实行精兵简政，彻底改革旧的行政机构，从组织上巩固和发展了革命委员会，进一步发挥了革命政权的威力。
    韩庄发电厂革命委员会于四月一日成立后，就决定对旧机构进行彻底改革，实行精兵简政。怎样改革？没有现成方案。革委会的同志就深入到群众中去，广泛征求广大群众的意见。经过两年来文化大革命锻炼的广大革命群众，对旧的行政机构及其管理制度早已非常痛恨。他们对于打破重叠的行政机构，精兵简政，实行一元化的领导，坚决拥护，坚决支持。大家热情地谈看法，提方案。通过广泛讨论，新方案的轮廓已经基本形成。革委会的同志把这些意见加以集中整理，又参考了一些外单位的先进经验，拟订出一个比较合理的新方案，将原来大小十几个科室，改革为“三组一室”（即政治工作组，生产建设组，后勤服务组，革委会办公室）。实践证明，这次改革对于克服官僚主义旧习气，树立密切联系群众的作风，起了重大的作用。
    在改革厂级机构的同时，还对车间以及班组的领导机构进行了改革。车间一级成立了不脱产的三结合领导小组。车间三结合领导小组，既统一负责各车间革命、生产的领导工作，又分工负责各自所在班组革命、生产的领导工作，实现了一元化的领导。他们天天和班组工人生活、劳动、学习、战斗在一起，“既当‘官’，又当老百姓”，大大促进了人的思想革命化。
    实行精兵简政，是一场尖锐的、深刻的阶级斗争。一小撮阶级敌人不断煽阴风，点鬼火。他们对一些原来的科室干部说：
  “你们没用场了，收拾家伙等着吧。”企图挑拨革命群众和革委会的关系，煽动群众抵制实行精兵简政。革委会牢记毛主席的“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的伟大教导，结合开展革命大批判，清理阶级队伍，稳、准、狠地打击一小撮叛徒、特务、死不改悔的走资派，以及没有改造好的地、富、反、坏、右分子。发动广大群众，揭露了他们的罪恶，及时粉碎了他们的破坏阴谋，保证了精兵简政工作的开展。
    精简机构以后，革命职工的革命热情空前高涨，全厂充满朝气蓬勃的新景象。各级领导机构的工作人员，普遍走上生产第一线，及时了解和解决革命和生产中的问题。在一次大修中，革命职工大破旧框框的束缚，提前八天完成大修任务，主要数据创造了新纪录。煤管小组过去六个脱产人员还不够用，现在无一人脱产，工效却成倍提高。
