	Recently, revolutionary mass movements have surged in various countries of Latin America. Students and workers in Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay, Chile, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Venezuela, and many other countries have been staging strikes, demonstrations, and clashes with American institutions, resisting police repression, and launching a powerful wave of anti-American and anti-dictatorship struggles. This demonstrates the new awakening of the people of Latin America.

	Latin America is not only the exclusive "backyard" of American imperialism but also a strategically important region. To implement its global counter-revolutionary strategy, American imperialism has been trying every means to strengthen its control over Latin America. However, things often turn out the opposite of what American imperialism wishes. The flames of revolution against American imperialism and dictatorship are burning more fiercely on the land of Latin America. The revolutionary struggles of the people of Latin America, together with the revolutionary struggles of the people of Asia, Africa, and the world, are dealing heavy blows to American imperialism.

	Our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out as early as twenty years ago: "The people of Latin America are not the docile slaves of American imperialism."

	For nearly a century, the people of Latin America have suffered from the aggression of American imperialism. Under the brutal oppression and exploitation of American monopolistic capital groups and their agents, they have endured immense suffering. The contradictions between the people of Latin America and American imperialism and its lackeys are irreconcilable. This contradiction can only be resolved through the national democratic revolutionary struggles of the people of Latin America, overthrowing the evil rule of American imperialism and its lackeys, and achieving complete national liberation. Currently, this contradiction has become increasingly sharp due to the further strengthening of American imperialism's control and plunder of Latin America and the continuous improvement of the political awareness of the people of Latin America. Therefore, the vigorous development of the revolutionary movement in Latin America is inevitable.

	American imperialism is the root cause of the suffering of over 200 million people in Latin America. It maintains its colonial rule through the puppet regimes it has installed in various countries. Therefore, whether it is the struggle of Brazilian students for democratic rights, or the struggle of Chilean workers for improved living conditions, whether it is the struggle of the Argentine people against the dictatorship, or the demonstrations of the revolutionary masses in Peru protesting against the ruling authorities' pro-American reactionary economic policies, their targets are inevitably aimed at American imperialism. The slogans "Down with American imperialism" and "Down with the dictatorship" echo through the cities of many countries in Latin America. This is the common voice of the workers, peasants, patriotic intellectuals, and broad revolutionary masses of the various countries in Latin America. Under the common goal of opposing American imperialism and its lackeys, the people of the various countries in Latin America will inevitably become more broadly united and launch increasingly fierce and sustained attacks on a small number of enemies.

	Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches: "The enemy will not retreat from the historical stage on its own. Whether it is the reactionaries in China or the aggressive forces of American imperialism in China, they will not retreat from the historical stage on their own." American imperialism and its lackeys in the various countries of Latin America will also not retreat from the historical stage on their own. Currently, the national democratic united front against American imperialism and its lackeys in the various countries of Latin America is continuously expanding. American imperialism and its lackeys in the various countries of Latin America are increasingly being surrounded by the broad masses of the people.

	Lenin once said: "Revolution can quickly unite people and quickly enlighten them. Every step forward in the revolution can awaken the masses." We firmly believe that as the revolutionary movements in the various countries of Latin America deepen, the broad masses of the people in these countries will become more awakened and, through revolutionary struggles, receive education and tempering, continuously strengthen unity, and expand their ranks. The torrent of the revolutionary movement in Latin America is irresistible. The liberation of the people of the various countries in Latin America is certain to come.

    拉丁美洲革命群众运动的新高涨
    本报评论员
    最近以来，拉丁美洲各国的革命群众运动蓬勃高涨。巴西、阿根廷、乌拉圭、智利、玻利维亚、哥伦比亚、厄瓜多尔、秘鲁、委内瑞拉等许多国家的学生和工人，前赴后继地举行罢课罢工，示威游行，袭击美国机构，反击军警镇压，掀起了强大的反美、反独裁的斗争浪潮。它显示了拉丁美洲各国人民的新觉醒。
    拉丁美洲不仅是美帝国主义独占的“后院”，而且是它的一个极为重要的战略要地。美帝国主义为了实行它的反革命全球战略，千方百计地加强对拉丁美洲的控制。但是，事情总是走向美帝国主义愿望的反面。反美、反独裁的革命之火，在拉丁美洲的大地上越来越炽烈地燃烧起来了。拉丁美洲人民的革命斗争，同亚洲、非洲和世界各国人民的革命斗争汇合在一起，正在给美帝国主义以沉重的打击。
    我们伟大的导师毛主席早在二十年以前就曾经指出：“拉丁美洲的人民，并不是顺从美国帝国主义的奴隶。”
    近一个世纪，拉丁美洲各国人民受尽了美帝国主义的侵略，他们在美国垄断资本集团和它的代理人的残酷压迫和剥削之下，受苦受难。拉丁美洲各国人民和美帝国主义及其走狗之间的矛盾是不可调和的。这个矛盾，只有通过拉丁美洲的各国人民的民族民主革命斗争，推翻美帝国主义及其走狗的罪恶统治，取得彻底的民族解放，才能解决。目前，这个矛盾，由于美帝国主义对拉丁美洲控制和掠夺的进一步加强，由于拉丁美洲的各国人民政治觉悟的不断提高，而变得越来越尖锐。因此，拉丁美洲的革命运动的蓬勃发展，是不可避免的。
    美帝国主义是两亿多拉丁美洲人民苦难的总根源。它通过它所扶植的各国傀儡政权来维持其殖民统治。因此，不论是巴西学生要求民主权利的斗争，或者智利工人要求改善生活待遇的斗争，不论是阿根廷人民反对独裁政权的斗争，或者秘鲁革命群众抗议统治当局奉行亲美反动经济政策的示威，它们的矛头都必然地要指向美帝国主义。“打倒美帝国主义”、“打倒独裁政权”的口号，响彻在拉丁美洲许多国家的城镇，这是拉丁美洲各国工人、农民、爱国知识分子和广大革命人民的共同的呼声。在反对美帝国主义及其走狗的共同目标之下，拉丁美洲各国人民必然会越来越广泛地团结起来，向着一小撮敌人发动日益猛烈的持久进攻。
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席教导说：“敌人是不会自行消灭的。无论是中国的反动派，或是美国帝国主义在中国的侵略势力，都不会自行退出历史舞台。”美帝国主义及其在拉丁美洲各国的走狗，也决不会自行退出历史舞台。现在，拉丁美洲各国反对美帝国主义及其走狗的民族民主统一战线正在不断扩大。美帝国主义及其在拉丁美洲的各国的走狗，已日益陷入广大人民群众的包围之中。
    列宁曾经说过：“革命能迅速地把人们团结起来，能迅速地使人们受到启发。革命每向前发展一步都能够唤醒群众”。我们深信，随着拉丁美洲各国革命运动的深入发展，这些国家的广大人民群众将会更加觉醒，并且在革命斗争的实践中受到教育和锻炼，不断加强团结，扩大队伍。拉丁美洲革命运动的洪流是不可阻挡的。拉丁美洲各国人民的解放是一定要到来的。
