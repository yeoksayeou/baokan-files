The U.S. imperialist head Johnson and the South Vietnamese puppet leader Thieu held two days of secret talks in Honolulu from the 19th to the 20th, discussing how to continue the current U.S. policy in Vietnam, which is now at a dead end.

Johnson and Thieu's talks, which were held between the master and the slave, are part of the U.S. imperialists' frenzied attempts to play both the war and peace cards in their counter-revolutionary strategy in Vietnam. According to Western news agencies, the purpose of their talks was to "approve the next military actions in the Vietnam War," so that while the U.S. intensifies its "peace talks" deception, it can further resort to military blackmail.

Johnson and Thieu's talks once again show that the U.S. imperialists will not stop their war of aggression in Vietnam unless they suffer a complete defeat on the battlefield. In the long and stinking joint communiqué they issued after the talks, apart from their blustering war cries, they also slandered the Vietnamese people and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam with some extremely absurd fallacies.

In the communiqué, Johnson and Thieu claimed that they had studied their "basic military deployment and strategy" in South Vietnam and reaffirmed their previously determined "objectives" for the U.S. aggression in Vietnam. This so-called "objective" is for U.S. imperialism to arbitrarily trample on and slaughter the Vietnamese people's beautiful mountains and rivers, and to allow U.S. imperialism to carry out aggression at will throughout Southeast Asia.

Given the current huge manpower difficulties the U.S. imperialists face in the Vietnam War and the high tide of the anti-draft movement in the United States, the communiqué emphasized that the United States would speed up the arming and expansion of the South Vietnamese puppet army. The communiqué said that the U.S. and puppet sides would "focus most of their attention on the steps currently being taken to increase the personnel and improve the combat effectiveness of the South Vietnamese armed forces." To expand the South Vietnamese puppet army, Thieu expressed his intention to step up conscription in South Vietnam, and Johnson expressed his intention to equip the South Vietnamese puppet army with the so-called new M16 rifles by 1969. The communiqué also announced that the U.S. and puppet military authorities would continue to "consult" on the issue of arming the South Vietnamese puppet army.

To plot the strengthening of the Vietnam War, before holding talks with Thieu, Johnson specially sent Secretary of Defense Clifford to inspect the military situation in South Vietnam for four days. After returning to the country, Clifford emphasized that the U.S. strategy in the Vietnam War would not change. Johnson, upon leaving Honolulu to return to the country, viciously said: "We have a firm resolve to continue pursuing all possible paths to peace, but we also have the same resolve to defend South Vietnam." Johnson's remarks fully exposed the U.S. imperialists' plot of "using war to pressure for peace" and "using war to force surrender."

The communiqué, to cover up the U.S. and puppet clique's plot to strengthen the war, hypocritically said they would "continue to seek to reduce the level of hostile actions and achieve a respectable and reliable peace." However, the facts have long exposed that the so-called "seeking to reduce the level of hostile actions" is just a euphemism for the U.S. imperialists to further strengthen their war of aggression.

The U.S. imperialists have carried out more concentrated and frenzied bombing of the vast areas of North Vietnam and South Vietnam. According to reports, in March, the U.S. bombing of the entire North Vietnam was 2,500 times. In April, after Johnson announced the so-called "partial halt to bombing," the bombing suddenly increased to more than 3,300 times. In May, it surged to more than 4,700 times, nearly doubling the March figure. In June, the bombing frequency was even more frequent, reaching an average of more than 170 times per day. At the same time, the U.S. B-52 bombers stationed on Okinawa Island increased from the original 75 to 90, and the number of sorties and bombings over the South Vietnam battlefield increased significantly. In recent months, the U.S. imperialists have been implementing "escalation" rather than "de-escalation" in both the South Vietnam battlefield and the pirate air raids on North Vietnam. In the South Vietnam battlefield, the U.S. imperialists are also continuing to increase troops and strengthen combat.

Johnson and Thieu's talks once again tell people: although the U.S. imperialists have suffered extremely heavy defeats on the Vietnam battlefield, they not only will not abandon their policy of aggression against Vietnam but also, with doubled frenzy, resort to military adventurism and political deception to make their dying struggles. However, countless facts have shown that the more frenzied the U.S. imperialists struggle, the faster they will head towards complete failure.

### 美帝疯狂挣扎挽救不了在南越的彻底失败  美帝头子约翰逊和南越傀儡头目阮文绍在檀香山密谋强化侵越战争

    美帝疯狂挣扎挽救不了在南越的彻底失败
    美帝头子约翰逊和南越傀儡头目阮文绍在檀香山密谋强化侵越战争
    新华社二十二日讯美帝国主义头子约翰逊和南越卖国集团头目阮文绍，十九日到二十日在檀香山举行了两天的秘密会谈，讨论继续推行美国目前正陷于穷途末路的侵越政策的问题。
    约翰逊和阮文绍这次主、奴之间的会谈，是美帝国主义在越南问题上猖狂地玩弄战、“和”两手反革命策略的时候举行的。据西方通讯社报道，他们会谈的目的是要“批准在越南战争中的下一步军事行动”，以便在美国加紧玩弄“和谈”骗局的同时进一步施展军事讹诈。
    约翰逊和阮文绍的会谈，再一次表明，美帝国主义除非在战场上遭到彻底的失败，是决不会停止它侵略越南的战争的。他们在会谈后发表的一篇又长又臭的联合公报里，除了色厉内荏地进行战争叫嚣外，就是诬蔑越南人民和越南民主共和国的一些极其荒诞的谬论。
    约翰逊和阮文绍在公报里声称，他们在会谈中研究了他们在南越的“基本军事部署情况和战略”，并且重申他们已经确定的美国侵略越南的“目标”。这种所谓“目标”就是由美帝国主义任意蹂躏、宰割越南人民的大好山河，并且让美帝国主义在整个东南亚地区肆意进行侵略。
    在美帝国主义目前在侵越战争中存在巨大的人力困难和美国国内人民反征兵运动高涨的情况下，公报强调，美国要加紧武装和扩充南越卖国集团军队。公报说，美伪双方“大部分注意力集中于目前正在采取的使南越武装部队增加兵员和改进作战力的步骤”。为了扩充南越傀儡军队，阮文绍表示要在南越加紧抓丁拉伕，约翰逊表示要在一九六九年内，全部用美国的所谓新式武器M16步枪，把南越卖国军队装备起来。公报还宣布，美伪军事当局将继续就加紧武装南越卖国军队的问题进行“磋商”。
    为了策划强化侵越战争，在同阮文绍举行会谈之前，约翰逊特地派遣国防部长克利福德，对南越军事局势进行了四天就地视察。克利福德回国后强调，美国在侵越战争中的战略不会有什么改变。约翰逊在离开檀香山回国时也恶狠狠地说：“我们有坚定的决心，继续追求各种可能通向和平的道路，但是我们也有同样的决心保卫南越。”约翰逊的这番话，完全暴露了美帝国主义“以战压和”、“以战迫降”的阴谋。
    会谈公报为了掩盖美伪集团强化战争的阴谋，假惺惺地说他们要“继续谋求降低敌对行动的水平以及实现体面和可靠的和平”。可是，事实早已揭穿，所谓“谋求降低敌对行动的水平”，不过是美帝进一步强化侵略战争的同义语。
    美帝国主义对越南北方南部广大地区进行了更密集、更疯狂的轰炸。据报道，三月间，美国对整个越南北方的轰炸是二千五百次。在约翰逊宣布所谓“部分停炸”后的四月间，轰炸骤然增加到三千三百多次。五月间，又猛升到四千七百多次，比三月份增加将近一倍。六月间，轰炸次数更加频繁，达到平均每天一百七十多次。在这同时，驻在冲绳岛的美国B—52轰炸机，从原来的七十五架增加到九十架，对南越战场的出动架次和投弹量都大大增加。几个月来，美帝国主义无论是在越南南方战场上或是在对越南北方的强盗空袭中，实行的都是“升级”，而决不是“降级”。在越南南方战场上，美帝也在继续增兵和加强作战。
    约翰逊和阮文绍的会谈再一次告诉人们：美帝国主义尽管在越南战场上遭到极其惨重的失败，但是它不仅不会放弃侵略越南的政策，而且以加倍的疯狂，采取军事冒险和政治欺骗等手段进行垂死的挣扎。然而，无数的事实已经表明，美帝国主义越是疯狂挣扎，就越要加速走向彻底的失败。
