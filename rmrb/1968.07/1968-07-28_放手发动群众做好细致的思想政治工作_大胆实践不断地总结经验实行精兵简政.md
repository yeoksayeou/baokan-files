The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "Revolutionary committees must implement unified leadership, break down overlapping administrative structures, streamline and reduce bureaucracy, and organize a revolutionary leadership team that is closely connected with the masses." The Beijing Knitting Factory Revolutionary Committee, following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, with the help of the support-left personnel from the 8341st Unit, took a resolute attitude, bravely jumped out of the old organizational framework, and through thorough criticism and struggle, conducted in-depth and detailed ideological and political work, mobilized the masses, boldly practiced, continuously summarized experiences, implemented streamlining and reduction of bureaucracy, and established a new revolutionary style.

After the establishment of the Revolutionary Committee on November 11 last year, the factory began to study the issue of streamlining and reduction of bureaucracy. At that time, there were two opinions within the Revolutionary Committee: the majority of comrades believed that the old structure was redundant and bloated, "this office, that department, over 200 cadres off the production line; few do the work, many push the work," resulting in a severe disconnect from the masses, and a thorough reform of the old structure was necessary. However, a minority of comrades advocated adjusting some departments and sending down some cadres on the basis of the original structure.

Facing this situation, the factory Revolutionary Committee and the support-left personnel repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's brilliant "May 7th Directive" and related teachings on the construction of political power, and mobilized all the revolutionary workers in the factory to carry out a continuous study, debate, and criticism for more than twenty days. The revolutionary workers, armed with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, fiercely criticized the counter-revolutionary revisionist line that China's Khrushchev promoted in the construction of political power and enterprise management, and exposed the dangers of a cumbersome organizational structure. Everyone unanimously recognized that China's Khrushchev vigorously promoted the counter-revolutionary revisionist line, frantically set up a large and bloated organizational structure, pushed for the "factory director responsibility system," "expert management," advocated "production first," and "profit-oriented," all of which were against emphasizing proletarian politics, opposing Chairman Mao's mass line, and attempting to restore capitalism. Young cadre Fu Lijun from the original Labor and Wages Department angrily denounced: "China's Khrushchev wanted us young people to sit in the office as soon as we graduated from school, high above the masses, disconnected from the people, and tried to cultivate us into successors of revisionism. His intentions are extremely malicious!" She said, "We must listen to Chairman Mao's words, implement streamlining and reduction of bureaucracy, and walk the path of integrating with the workers and peasants." Deputy Director of the Revolutionary Committee and former Deputy Director Zhang Chengming said with deep feelings: "One of the crimes of China's Khrushchev in promoting the counter-revolutionary revisionist line is to set up a large bureaucratic organization, opposing cadres and the masses. In the early stages of the movement, one of the important reasons I was criticized by the masses was that I relied on layer-by-layer reports and numerical reports to lead work, disconnected from the masses, and made mistakes. This time, we must thoroughly break down this old system in streamlining and reduction of bureaucracy."

The criticism of China's Khrushchev's counter-revolutionary revisionist line greatly raised the awareness of class struggle and the two-line struggle among the members of the Revolutionary Committee and the broad masses of workers. Everyone further realized that thoroughly reforming the original old structure is a necessity for continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat, a guarantee for the revolutionary power to take root among the masses, preventing the spread of bureaucratism and the restoration of capitalism, and a key to further consolidating and developing the newly born Revolutionary Committee. They were determined to take the path of "streamlining and reduction of bureaucracy."

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Mastering ideological education is the central link in uniting the whole party to engage in great political struggles." In the process of streamlining and reduction of bureaucracy, the majority of cadres were enthusiastic, but some cadres also had confused ideas: "It's hard to work upstairs, it's hard to look down," "Those who stay upstairs are those who hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought; those who go downstairs are those with many shortcomings and errors," and so on. Facing these active thoughts, the factory Revolutionary Committee held a cadre study class on Mao Zedong Thought, using the "Three Articles" as a weapon to criticize and repudiate revisionism. In the study class, cadres studied Chairman Mao's teachings: "We Communists are not seeking office but revolution," fiercely criticized China's Khrushchev's reactionary bourgeois ideas such as the "join the party to seek office" theory and the "public-private fusion" theory, making cadres realize that seeking office or revolution is a fundamental contradiction between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat. Every revolutionary cadre must be able to go up or down, be an official or a civilian. Whether staying upstairs or going down to the production frontline, it is a revolutionary need, and one must always hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, be absolutely loyal to Chairman Mao, absolutely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and absolutely loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Members of the Revolutionary Committee and support-left personnel had discussions and heart-to-heart talks with the cadres, doing detailed ideological work. Military representatives also told the stories of Zhang Zide and the old Red Army cadres who completely and thoroughly served the people, helping them further establish the idea of serving the people wholeheartedly. The broad masses of cadres all expressed their willingness to actively respond to Chairman Mao's call for "streamlining and reduction of bureaucracy" and follow the great leader Chairman Mao in revolution for life.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The masses are the real heroes," "in a certain sense, the most intelligent and most talented are the most experienced fighters." Is streamlining and reduction of bureaucracy done by mobilizing the masses or by a few people coldly and quietly? On this issue, the factory Revolutionary Committee had a profound lesson. At the beginning, they sat in the office and formulated a plan, which was immediately criticized by the masses when taken to them. Originally, this plan not only had unreasonable aspects, but the arrangement of personnel also had traces of bourgeois factionalism. Later, they mobilized all revolutionary workers to come up with ideas and solutions, and the members of the Revolutionary Committee also went down to study with the masses. The revolutionary workers, based on the principles of "simplification, unification, efficiency, economy, and anti-bureaucratism," actively proposed suggestions and quickly came up with a relatively complete plan for organizational reform. This was a vivid lesson for the members of the Revolutionary Committee, making them realize that the masses are the smartest, the masses have the richest experience, and the masses are the most familiar with the situation. Everything must be done by believing in the masses, relying on the masses, and respecting the masses' pioneering spirit.

Thoroughly reforming the original old organizational structure and enterprise management is a difficult and entirely new task, which must be done with Chairman Mao's latest instructions as a weapon, boldly practicing and continuously revolutionizing, in order to explore a new organizational structure on the old foundation that adapts to the socialist economic base. For example, the old organizational structure had five levels of management: general factory, sub-factory, workshop, work team, and small group. During the reform, some advocated implementing a three-level management system, while others advocated implementing a two-level management system. The Revolutionary Committee, on the basis of universally implementing a three-level management system, conducted a trial of a two-level management system in one workshop to compare and gain experience.

As a result of implementing streamlining and reduction of bureaucracy, the number of full-time cadres in the entire factory was reduced by more than two-thirds compared to the original. The old Party Committee and the director's office had eleven departments, but now the factory Revolutionary Committee implements unified leadership with only three small groups. With a smaller leadership team and fewer staff, this prompted the members of the Revolutionary Committee to be even more closely connected with the masses, establishing a new revolutionary style. The revolutionary workers praised: "The organizational structure is small, the number of people is few, and the problem of too many people for too few jobs is solved; the leadership implements unified leadership, closely connects with the masses; emphasizes politics to grasp the fundamentals, promotes revolution and production; thought and organization are revolutionized, and the revolutionary power is consolidated."

### 放手发动群众做好细致的思想政治工作  大胆实践不断地总结经验实行精兵简政

    放手发动群众做好细致的思想政治工作
    大胆实践不断地总结经验实行精兵简政
    北京针织总厂革委会在八三四一部队支左人员的帮助下，实行了一元化的领导，打破了重叠的行政机构，树立了崭新的革命作风
    本报讯　伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“革命委员会要实行一元化的领导，打破重叠的行政机构，精兵简政，组织起一个革命化的联系群众的领导班子。”北京针织总厂革命委员会，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，在八三四一部队支左人员的帮助下，采取坚决的态度，勇敢地跳出原来旧机构的圈子，通过狠抓革命大批判，做深入细致的思想政治工作，放手发动群众，大胆实践，不断总结经验，实行了精兵简政，树立了崭新的革命作风。
    这个厂去年十一月十一日成立了革命委员会以后，就着手研究精兵简政。当时，在革委会内部存在两种意见：大多数同志认为，旧机构重叠、臃肿，“这个室，那个科，脱产干部二百多；干事的少，‘推’事的多”，人浮于事，严重脱离群众，必须对旧机构实行彻底的改革；但也有少数同志主张，在原来基础上调整一些科室，下去一些干部就可以了。
    针对这种情况，厂革命委员会和支左人员反复学习了毛主席光辉的“五·七”指示和有关政权建设的教导，并发动全厂广大革命职工开展了持续二十多天的大学习、大辩论、大批判。广大革命职工以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫在政权建设和企业管理方面所推行的反革命修正主义路线，大揭机构庞杂的危害。大家一致认识到：中国赫鲁晓夫极力推行反革命修正主义路线，拚命设置庞大臃肿的机构，大搞“厂长责任制”，“专家治厂”，鼓吹“生产第一”，“利润挂帅”，就是反对突出无产阶级政治，对抗毛主席的群众路线，妄图复辟资本主义。原劳动工资科青年干部傅笠君愤怒地控诉：“中国赫鲁晓夫叫我们青年人出了学校门就坐办公室，高高在上，脱离群众，妄图把我们培养成修正主义的接班人，用心十分恶毒！”她说：“我们坚决听毛主席的话，实行精兵简政，走与工农群众相结合的道路。”厂革委会副主任、原副厂长张成明深有感触地说：“中国赫鲁晓夫推行反革命修正主义路线的一个罪恶，就是大搞庞大的官僚机构，把干部和广大群众对立起来。我在运动初期受到群众批评，一个重要原因就是过去靠层层汇报和数字表报领导工作，脱离了群众，犯了错误。这次精兵简政，我们一定要彻底把这套旧东西破掉。”
    对中国赫鲁晓夫反革命修正主义路线的大批判，大大提高了革委会成员和广大职工阶级斗争和两条路线斗争的觉悟。大家进一步认识到，对原来的旧机构实行彻底的改革，是无产阶级专政下继续革命的需要，是使革命政权扎根于群众，防止官僚主义莠草滋生、防止资本主义复辟的组织保证，是进一步巩固和发展新生的革命委员会的关键所在。他们决心走“精兵简政”的道路。
    毛主席教导说：“掌握思想教育，是团结全党进行伟大政治斗争的中心环节。”在精兵简政过程中，广大干部态度积极，但是部分干部也有一些糊涂认识：“在上面难干，到下面难看。”“留在上面的，是高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗的；到下面去的，是缺点错误多的”，等等。针对这些活思想，厂革命委员会举办了干部毛泽东思想学习班，以“老三篇”为武器，斗私批修。在学习班里，干部们学习了毛主席的教导：“我们共产党人不是要做官，而是要革命”，狠批了中国赫鲁晓夫的“入党做官”论、“公私溶化”论等反动的资产阶级思想，使干部们认识到，要做官还是要革命，这是资产阶级同无产阶级两种根本对立的世界观。每个革命干部，都要能上能下，能“官”能民。不论留在上面，或下到生产第一线，都是革命的需要，都要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，都要无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于毛泽东思想，无限忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。革委会成员和支左人员同干部们座谈，个别谈心，做细致的思想工作。军队代表还给大家讲张思德和红军老干部完全彻底为人民服务的事迹，帮助他们进一步树立全心全意为人民服务的思想。广大干部都表示要积极响应毛主席“精兵简政”的号召，紧跟伟大领袖毛主席干一辈子革命。
    毛主席教导说：“群众是真正的英雄”，“在某种意义上来说，最聪明、最有才能的，是最有实践经验的战士。”精兵简政是发动群众来搞，还是少数人冷冷清清地搞？在这个问题上，厂革命委员会有深刻的教训。开始，他们坐在办公室里制定了一个方案，刚拿到群众中去，就受到广大群众的批评。原来这个方案不仅有不合理的地方，人员的安排也有资产阶级派性的痕迹。后来，他们就发动广大革命职工都来出主意想办法，革命委员会成员也下去和群众一起研究。广大革命职工本着“精简、统一、效能、节约和反对官僚主义五项目的”，踊跃提出建议，很快提出了一个比较完善的改革机构的方案。这给革命委员会成员上了生动的一课，使他们认识到，群众最聪明，群众的经验最丰富，群众对情况最熟悉。办任何事情都必须相信群众，依靠群众，必须尊重群众的首创精神。
    对原来的旧机构和企业管理实行彻底的改革，是一件艰苦的、全新的工作，必须以毛主席的最新指示为武器，大胆实践，不断革命，才能在破旧的基础上摸索出一套新的、适应社会主义经济基础的组织机构。例如，旧机构分总厂、分厂、车间、工段和小组五级管理，在改革中，有的主张实行三级管理，有的主张实行两级管理。革命委员会就在普遍实行三级管理的基础上，在一个车间进行两级管理的试验，以便进行比较，取得经验。
    这个厂实行精兵简政的结果，全厂脱产干部比原来减少三分之二以上。旧党委和厂长办公室下有十一个科室，现在厂革命委员会实行一元化领导，只设三个办事小组。领导班子小了，办事人员少了，这就促使革命委员会成员更紧密地联系群众，树立了崭新的革命作风。广大革命职工赞扬说：机构小，人员少，人浮于事克服了；领导实行一元化，密切联系群众了；突出政治抓根本，革命、生产促进了；思想、组织革命化，革命政权巩固了。
