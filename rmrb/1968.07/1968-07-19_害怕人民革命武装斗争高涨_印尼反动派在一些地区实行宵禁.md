According to a Xinhua News Agency report from Jakarta: In the face of the burgeoning revolutionary armed struggle of the Indonesian people, the Suharto-Nasution fascist military regime is in a state of panic. Recently, it hurriedly announced a curfew in some parts of East Java.

According to recent reports from Western news agencies, to block news of the victories of the Indonesian people's armed struggle from reaching the outside world, the Indonesian fascist military regime's Army Information Bureau has also refused to issue permits to foreign journalists to travel to East Java. The regions where this fascist military regime has banned foreign journalists from reporting include Central Java and West Kalimantan, where the people's armed struggle is also developing.

The head of the Indonesian fascist military regime, Suharto, recently exclaimed in a public speech that the Indonesian Communist Party members and revolutionary people, who have been brutally suppressed, have "risen again." The Army Commander of the Indonesian fascist regime, Panggabean, recently admitted in a conversation with news reporters that the "situation is quite serious." The Jakarta Military District Commander, Mahmud, also recently admitted that the activities of the Indonesian Communist Party members and revolutionary people to "gather strength" have made "significant progress," making the fascist military regime "deeply feel" the "danger."

    害怕人民革命武装斗争高涨
    印尼反动派在一些地区实行宵禁
    据新华社讯　雅加达消息：苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯军人政权在蓬勃兴起的印尼人民的革命武装斗争面前，惶恐不安，最近慌忙宣布对东爪哇一些地区实行宵禁。
    据西方通讯社最近报道，为了对外封锁印尼人民武装斗争胜利发展的消息，印尼法西斯军人政权的陆军新闻处还拒绝发给外国记者到东爪哇采访的通行证。这个法西斯军人政权禁止外国记者采访的地区，还包括人民武装斗争日益发展的中爪哇和西加里曼丹等地。
    印尼法西斯军人政权的头目苏哈托最近在一篇公开讲话中惊呼：遭到残酷镇压的印尼共产党人和革命人民“已经东山再起”。印尼法西斯政权的陆军司令庞加贝安最近在对新闻记者的一次谈话中公开承认：“局势相当严重”。这个法西斯政权的雅加达军区司令马哈茂德在最近的一次谈话中也承认，印尼共产党人和革命人民“为集结力量”而进行的活动取得了“不可忽视的进展”，使法西斯军人政权“深深地感觉到”了“危险性”。
