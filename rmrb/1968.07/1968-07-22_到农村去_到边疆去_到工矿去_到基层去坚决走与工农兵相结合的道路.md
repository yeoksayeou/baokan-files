The new second middle school in Xingtai City, Hebei Province, organized a class for graduates and their parents to study Mao Zedong Thought, which fundamentally raised the graduates' class struggle consciousness and awareness of the struggle between the two lines.

The report states: After being tempered by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the class struggle consciousness and awareness of the struggle between the two lines of five hundred graduates from Xingtai City's New Second Middle School have been greatly enhanced. The vast majority of students can correctly handle their graduation assignments. However, a few students are reluctant to go to the countryside. The stationed PLA Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team deeply realized that the graduation assignment involves a fierce struggle between two classes and two lines. This is not just a matter of graduates' employment, but a major issue of which line they will follow, which path they will take, and whose successor they will be. Therefore, to help students overcome incorrect thoughts in graduation assignments, it is necessary to criticize the revisionist educational line advocated by China's Khrushchev and his agents in the school, and fundamentally raise the graduates' class struggle consciousness and awareness of the struggle between the two lines.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Holding study classes is a good method; many problems can be solved in study classes." With the help of the Propaganda Team, the Revolutionary Committee organized a study class for all graduates to deeply study Chairman Mao's teachings on "completely" and "thoroughly" serving the people, severely criticize China's Khrushchev's reactionary fallacies of "studying to become an official" and "achieving fame and fortune"; deeply study Chairman Mao's teachings on the integration of educated youth with workers and peasants, and severely criticize China's Khrushchev's advocacy of separating politics, practice, and the masses, and his revisionist black goods. Through learning and criticism, students deeply realized that China's Khrushchev and a handful of capitalist roaders within the party have long advocated the fallacies of "studying to become an official," "achieving fame and fortune," and "all professions are lowly, only studying is noble" among students, aiming to lead students astray into the revisionist path and make them successors of the bourgeoisie. Chairman Mao's guidance for youth to follow the path of integrating with the worker and peasant masses is to cultivate youth into successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause. This is the greatest concern of the great leader Chairman Mao for the youth. Chairman Mao teaches us: "The final dividing line between revolutionary and non-revolutionary or counter-revolutionary intellectuals is whether they are willing and able to integrate with the worker and peasant masses." Going to the countryside, going to the border, going to the factories, going to the grassroots, and integrating with the worker and peasant masses, humbly learning from the worker and peasant masses, can enable intellectuals to better transform their subjective world while transforming the objective world. This is the only correct path for youth to achieve ideological revolutionization, and a strategic measure to prevent capitalist restoration and ensure that our country remains unchanged for thousands of generations. Students said: We are the children of poor and lower-middle peasants, the descendants of revolution, and we bear the responsibility of building communism. We must not disappoint Chairman Mao and the people of the whole country. We must definitely follow Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and happily go to the countryside.

In the study class, students carried forward the revolutionary spirit of the Red Guards daring to rebel, severely criticized the revisionist educational line, and severely criticized the "self" in their minds. Everyone consciously compared themselves with Chairman Mao's teachings, examined themselves for being poisoned by the revisionist line, and severely fought against selfishness. One student examined himself for being poisoned by China's Khrushchev's "studying to become an official" and decided to go to the countryside. He said: "Having 'self' in the mind makes it easy to fall for China's Khrushchev's tricks. In graduation assignments, we must not let 'self' confuse our minds and become captives of the bourgeois reactionary line. We must severely criticize the bourgeois reactionary line and thoroughly eliminate selfishness and establish public-mindedness." Another student originally thought that going to the mountains and countryside had no future and was worthless; now he realized that different classes have different views on what is a future and what is worth. For a proletarian revolutionary, honestly being a servant of the people, wholeheartedly serving the people, and struggling for Chairman Mao's revolutionary line all one's life is the greatest future and worth. On the contrary, pursuing fame and fortune, seeking comfort and enjoyment is the most worthless and has no future. Another student was originally bound by the old habits of society; after learning, they said: "We are Chairman Mao's Red Guards, critics of the old world, and we must use our model actions to overcome various old habits."

Subsequently, with the help of the Propaganda Team, the Revolutionary Committee organized various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes for graduates and their parents. One type invited parents to the school to hold classes, and another type had teachers and students go to the streets and households to hold classes. In the past month, they held more than forty study classes in twelve streets across the city. At the same time, they launched the Red Letter Campaign, encouraging graduates to write letters to their parents in other places to propagate Chairman Mao's proletarian educational line. In the study classes, parents and students together severely criticized China's Khrushchev's revisionist educational line, further seeing its reactionary essence. Grandma Zhao Guizhen recalled the hardships of her ancestors working for landlords in the old society, not being able to go to school, and being deceived and bullied by landlord tyrants because of their lack of education. She said: "Schools in the old society were for the rich, and the children of landlords, after getting an education, would ride on the heads of the poor and act arrogantly. China's Khrushchev wants to cultivate students into oppressors of the poor, and we poor and lower-middle peasants will never agree. Now the school is for us poor and lower-middle peasants, and the children of poor and lower-middle peasants, after getting an education, must serve the working people. Originally, I was poisoned by China's Khrushchev and wanted my granddaughter to study well, find a good job in the future, earn a lot of money, and support me in my old age. Now, I want my granddaughter to listen to Chairman Mao's words, go to the countryside for tempering, and become a successor of the revolutionary cause." Grandma Chen Que Ni said: "If we let the children follow China's Khrushchev's way to become officials and earn money, the country will change color in the future, and we poor people will suffer again. I must let the children listen to Chairman Mao's words, go to the countryside for tempering, and become reliable successors of the revolutionary cause." Parents unanimously expressed that they would educate their children to be infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, infinitely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, becoming successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause, preventing capitalist restoration, which is the fundamental purpose of educating children and the responsibility of every parent.

Through holding study classes and launching revolutionary criticism, the poison of the revisionist educational line advocated by China's Khrushchev was further eliminated, the old habits left over from the old society were washed away, and social customs were greatly changed. Many parents led their children to the Revolutionary Committee, requesting to let their children go to the mountains and countryside. Many parents prepared production tools and packed luggage for their children. Now, in Xingtai City's New Second Middle School, teachers, students, and students' parents all support graduates going to the mountains and countryside, which has become a new social custom.

    到农村去　到边疆去　到工矿去　到基层去
    坚决走与工农兵相结合的道路
    邢台市新二中举办毕业生和家长参加的毛泽东思想学习班，从根本上提高了毕业生的阶级斗争觉悟和两条路线斗争觉悟
    本报讯　经过无产阶级文化大革命的锻炼，河北省邢台市新二中的五百名毕业生的阶级斗争觉悟和两条路线斗争觉悟有了很大的提高，绝大多数学生能够正确对待毕业分配。但是，有少数学生留恋城市，不愿到农村去。驻校的解放军毛泽东思想宣传队深刻地认识到，毕业生分配中贯穿着两个阶级、两条路线的激烈斗争。这不仅仅是毕业生劳动就业的问题，而且是毕业生执行什么路线，走什么道路，接什么班的大问题。因此，要帮助学生们克服毕业分配中的错误思想，必须批判中国赫鲁晓夫及其在本校的代理人所推行的修正主义教育路线，从根本上提高毕业生的阶级斗争觉悟和两条路线斗争觉悟。
    毛主席教导我们：“办学习班，是个好办法，很多问题可以在学习班得到解决。”校革委会在宣传队帮助下组织全体毕业生举办毛泽东思想学习班，深入学习毛主席关于
  “完全”、“彻底”为人民服务的教导，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫鼓吹的“读书做官”、“成名成家”的反动谬论；深入学习毛主席关于知识青年和工农相结合的教导，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫提倡的脱离政治、脱离实践、脱离群众的修正主义黑货。学生们从边学习边批判中深刻地认识到，中国赫鲁晓夫等党内一小撮走资派，长期以来在学生中鼓吹的“读书做官”、“成名成家”、“万般皆下品，唯有读书高”的谬论，就是要把学生引入修正主义歧途，使学生成为资产阶级的接班人。毛主席指引的青年要走与工农群众相结合的光辉道路，就是要把青年培养成为无产阶级革命事业的接班人，这是伟大领袖毛主席对青年的最大关怀。毛主席教导我们：“革命的或不革命的或反革命的知识分子的最后的分界，看其是否愿意并且实行和工农民众相结合。”到农村去，到边疆去，到工矿去，到基层去，与工农群众相结合，虚心向工农群众学习，就可以使知识分子在改造客观世界的同时，更好地改造主观世界。这是青年实现思想革命化的唯一的正确的道路，是防止资本主义复辟，保证我国千秋万代不变颜色的战略措施。学生们说：我们是贫下中农的子女，是革命的后代，肩上挑着建设共产主义的重担，我们决不能辜负毛主席和全国劳动人民的希望，一定要执行毛主席的革命路线，高兴地到农村去。
    在学习班里，学生们发扬红卫兵敢于造反的革命精神，大造修正主义教育路线的反，大造头脑里的“私”字的反。大家自觉地对照毛主席的教导，查自己受修正主义路线的毒害，狠斗私心。有的学生检查了自己中了中国赫鲁晓夫“读书做官”的毒，决心到农村去。他说：“头脑里有了‘私’字，就容易上中国赫鲁晓夫的当。在毕业分配上，决不能让‘私’字迷住了心窍，做资产阶级反动路线的俘虏。我们一定要大造资产阶级反动路线的反，彻底破私立公。”有的学生原来认为上山下乡没有前途，没出息；现在认识到，什么是前途，什么是出息，不同的阶级有不同的看法。对一个无产阶级革命派来说，老老实实当人民的勤务员，全心全意为人民服务，为执行和捍卫毛主席的革命路线奋斗终生，就是最大的前途、最大的出息。相反，追求成名成家，贪图安逸享受，是最没有前途、最没有出息的。有的学生原来受了社会上旧习惯势力的束缚，经过学习，他们说：“我们是毛主席的红卫兵，是旧世界的批判者，要用我们的模范行动，去战胜各种旧习惯势力。”
    接着，革委会又在宣传队帮助下举办了由毕业生和家长参加的各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班。一种是把家长请到学校里来办，一种是教师和学生到街道和家庭里去办。一个月来，他们在全市十二条街道举办了四十多期学习班。同时开展了红色家信活动，发动毕业生给在外地的家长写信，宣传毛主席的无产阶级教育路线。在学习班里，家长们和学生一起狠批中国赫鲁晓夫的修正主义教育路线，更加看清了它的反动本质。赵桂珍老大娘回忆了在旧社会祖祖辈辈给地主扛活，上不起学，因为没有文化而受地主老财的愚弄和欺骗的遭遇，她说：“旧社会的学堂是给有钱人开的，地主的子女有了文化，就骑在咱穷人的头上作威作福。中国赫鲁晓夫就是要把学生培养成压迫穷人的人，咱贫下中农一万个不答应。现在的学校是为咱贫下中农开的，贫下中农的孩子学了文化就要为劳动人民服务。原来我中了中国赫鲁晓夫的毒，想让孙女好好上学，将来找个好工作，挣大钱，好养老。现在，我要让孙女好好听毛主席的话，到农村去锻炼，做革命事业的接班人。”陈缺妮大娘说：“如果让孩子照中国赫鲁晓夫那一套去做官挣钱，将来国家就要变色，咱穷人又要吃二遍苦。我一定要让孩子听毛主席的话，到农村去锻炼，成为革命事业的可靠接班人。”家长们一致表示，要教育子女无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于毛泽东思想，无限忠于毛主席的革命路线，成为无产阶级革命事业的接班人，防止资本主义复辟，这是教育子女的根本目的，是每一个家长的责任。
    通过办学习班和开展革命大批判，进一步扫除了中国赫鲁晓夫所推行的修正主义教育路线的流毒，荡涤了旧社会遗留下来的旧习惯势力，极大地改变了社会风气。不少家长带领自己的子女到革委会，要求让自己的子女上山下乡。很多家长为子女准备好生产工具，收拾好行装。现在，在邢台市新二中师生和学生的家长中，支持毕业生上山下乡，已成为社会新风气。
