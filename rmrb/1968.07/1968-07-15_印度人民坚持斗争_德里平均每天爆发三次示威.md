The Indian people are persisting in their struggle. According to a report by the *Indian Times* on July 3, "Delhi is the city with the most demonstrations in the country. In this city, there is hardly a day without a demonstration, strike, or parade in support of one cause or another in one area or another." The newspaper reported that the number of demonstrators has increased by hundreds of times from 1948 to 1967. Last year, there were an average of three demonstrations per day.
