The revolutionary committee of Agang Town Coal Mine in Gansu Province, with the strong support of the People's Liberation Army leftist support personnel stationed at the mine, has held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought. They have vigorously carried out class struggle, conducted a thorough and sustained revolutionary criticism, promoted the revolutionization of people's thinking, and achieved excellent results in both revolution and production. In the first half of the year, the mine's raw coal production exceeded the state's production plan by 17% and was completed half a month ahead of schedule. It also set a new record for the highest daily raw coal production in recent years.

Under the leadership of the mine's revolutionary committees at various levels, all revolutionary workers in the mine have promoted the revolutionization of people's thinking through revolutionary criticism. They have insisted on carrying out the revolution well when they go up to the surface and carrying out production well when they go down to the mine. They have insisted on making a revolution on the spot, making a revolution in their spare time, making a revolution through thrift, and guarding their production posts. They have adhered to the eight-hour workday system and achieved remarkable results.

    甘肃省阿干镇煤矿创日产最高纪录
    甘肃省阿干镇煤矿革命委员会，在驻矿解放军支左人员的大力帮助下，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，狠抓阶级斗争，深入持久地开展革命大批判，促进了人的思想革命化，全矿革命和生产形势大好。上半年原煤产量提前半月超额百分之十七完成了国家生产计划，并且创造了近几年来日产原煤的最高纪录。
    在煤矿的各级革委会领导下，全矿革命职工通过革命大批判，促进了人的思想革命化。他们坚持上井搞好革命，下井搞好生产，坚持就地闹革命，业余闹革命，节约闹革命，坚守生产岗位，坚持八小时工作制，做出了显著成绩。　　（据新华社讯）
