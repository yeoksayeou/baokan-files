The traitorous nature of the Soviet revisionist clique as an accomplice to U.S. imperialism's aggression in Vietnam has long been exposed to the world. Recently, this gang of shameless traitors has put on another brilliant performance, fully revealing their servile attitude towards U.S. imperialism.

An American plane loaded with U.S. troops invading Vietnam was forced to land in Soviet territory while en route to Vietnam. The Soviet revisionist traitors not only dared not utter a single word of public reproach but, after notifying the Americans, obediently allowed the plane to continue on its way to the Vietnam battlefield. The Soviet revisionist traitors' deep affection and thorough consideration for U.S. imperialism are truly exemplary!

The Soviet revisionist clique's servile behavior has even surprised some U.S. officials. The Associated Press reported on July 1 that Washington officials estimated that Moscow would not quickly release the American plane because doing so would certainly invite "severe criticism" from the people of the world. However, the Soviet revisionist clique, in its eagerness to please its American masters, would not hesitate to lose face. Indeed, they would laugh at insults and continue to act as servants.

The Soviet revisionist clique often swears to the heavens that they are firmly supporting the Vietnamese people. Does giving hospitality to U.S. imperialist military planes transporting troops to invade Vietnam count as a form of "support for Vietnam"? Are these American military personnel not going to Vietnam to kill but to help the Vietnamese people?!

In fact, in the eyes of the Soviet revisionist traitors, releasing an American plane carrying over 200 U.S. troops invading Vietnam, allowing these invaders to go and slaughter the Vietnamese people, is merely a "small" favor to Washington. The Brezhnev-Kosygin gang of traitors has long been the main accomplices of U.S. aggression in Vietnam. They help the United States "stabilize" the situation in Europe and strive to extinguish revolutionary fires around the world, so that the United States can withdraw troops to invade Vietnam. The number of troops involved is far more than just over 200. Having already done the big favors, doing a small one is, of course, a matter of course.

Our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out: "Counter-revolutionaries give people false appearances while hiding the true ones. But since they are counter-revolutionaries, they cannot completely hide their true appearances."

Like all reactionaries, the Soviet revisionist clique is an unpaid negative teacher. They will inevitably expose themselves through their actions, making the broad masses of the people see more clearly their counter-revolutionary ugly faces and rise up to wage a more resolute struggle against them. It can be said for certain that the Soviet revisionist traitors will continue to do this negative teaching work until they are finally destroyed.

    大帮凶的一次小帮忙
    苏修集团充当美帝国主义侵越帮凶的叛徒面目，早已暴露于全世界。最近，这伙无耻叛徒又作出了一次精采的表演，活现出他们跪倒在美帝国主义面前的那一副奴才相。
    一架满载侵越美军的美国飞机在飞往越南途中经过苏联领空被迫降落。苏修叛徒集团不但不敢公开指责一句，而且竟在美国打了个招呼之后就乖乖地让其继续上路，直奔越南战场。苏修叛徒对于美帝国主义，可谓情义深重，照应周全！
    苏修叛徒集团的这种奴颜婢膝的行径，甚至使一些美国官员也感到意外。美联社七月一日的电讯曾经报道说：华盛顿的官员们估计莫斯科不会很快地释放那架美国飞机，因为这样做一定会遭到世界人民的“严厉批评”。不料苏修集团为了急于讨好他们的美国主子，即使丢尽脸皮也在所不计。这真是，笑骂由你笑骂，奴才我自为之。
    苏修集团老是指天发誓，他们是如何“坚决”支援越南人民的。难道对于美帝国主义往越南运送侵略军的军用飞机给以礼遇，也算是一种“援越”的行动吗？莫非这些美国军事人员不是去屠杀而是去援助越南人民的么？！
    其实，在苏修叛徒集团看来，他们释放一架载有二百多名侵越美军的美国飞机，让这些侵略者去屠杀越南人民，不过是向华盛顿送了一个“小小的”人情。勃列日涅夫——柯西金这一伙叛徒，本来就是美国侵略越南的大帮凶。他们帮助美国“稳定”欧洲局势，并竭力扑灭世界各地的革命烈火，以便于让美国抽调军队侵入越南，其数目何止二百多名呢？大忙都已经帮了，帮个小忙，当然是不在话下。
    我们的伟大领袖毛主席指出：“反革命分子，他们给人以假象，而将真象荫蔽着。但是他们既要反革命，就不可能将其真象荫蔽得十分彻底。”
    同一切反动派一样，苏修集团是不拿薪金的反面教员。他们总是要不断地用自己的行动揭穿自己，使广大人民更加看清他们反革命的丑恶面目，起来同他们进行更坚决的斗争。可以肯定，这件反面教员的工作，苏修叛徒集团是一定要继续做下去的，直到他们最后灭亡。
