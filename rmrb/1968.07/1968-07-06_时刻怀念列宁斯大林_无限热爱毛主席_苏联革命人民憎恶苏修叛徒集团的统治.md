The revolutionary people of the Soviet Union, who have a glorious revolutionary tradition, deeply detest the rule of the Soviet revisionist traitor clique. They always remember Lenin and Stalin, and endlessly love Chairman Mao. The feelings of the Soviet revolutionary people are often revealed in their words and deeds.

Remembering Stalin, Loving Mao Zedong!

One day, in a waiting room at a civil aviation airport in a certain place in China, a propaganda troupe for Mao Zedong Thought was performing artistic programs for foreign friends passing through. A group of Soviet tourists, under the supervision of their leader, seemed silent and restrained, sitting in the waiting room flipping through magazines indifferently. However, their attention was drawn to the troupe's excellent performance. When the program "Mao Zedong Thought Shines Brightly" was performed, some Soviet tourists couldn't help but tap their feet lightly to the rhythm; when the propagandist sang loudly "Ode to Stalin," they were all deeply moved, some even dropped the magazines they were holding unknowingly. Among them, a Soviet tourist in his fifties, taking the opportunity to borrow a cigarette, secretly wiped away the tears welling up in his eyes. As soon as the song ended, several Soviet tourists, without hesitation, applauded enthusiastically along with other foreign tourists.

An elderly Soviet man, with a heart full of excitement, quietly told a Chinese translator, "We Soviet people love Mao Zedong and remember Stalin!"

Heart Towards Chairman Mao

At a certain port in our country, two Soviet sailors who came to China would always nod and smile at Chinese comrades when they saw the bright and shiny Mao Chairman badges on the chest of Chinese workers. When they received the beloved Mao Chairman badges from Chinese comrades, they were overjoyed and didn't know how to express their infinite happiness and great excitement. They carefully pinned the Mao Chairman badges to their inner clothing and then told the Chinese comrades, "The Soviet revisionist traitors are extremely bad; they oppose China and are extraordinarily afraid of Mao Zedong Thought, forbidding us from reading Chairman Mao's books and not allowing us to wear Mao Chairman badges. We wear the Mao Chairman badges on our inner clothing to avoid being discovered by them, and also to let the red sun forever shine in our hearts."

When these two Soviet sailors received the much-needed red treasure book "Quotations from Chairman Mao" from Chinese comrades, they could not hold back their excitement. They expressed to the Chinese comrades, "The hearts of the Soviet people are with Chairman Mao." They also expressed their determination to apply Mao Zedong Thought to revolutionary practice and to "overthrow the rule of Soviet revisionism and rebuild the proletarian dictatorship."

Hurrah, Mao Zedong!

Once, a Chinese cargo ship docked at a port in the Soviet Union. Many Soviet stevedores, despite the police's obstruction, rushed onto the ship to ask Chinese sailors for revolutionary treasures "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and Mao Chairman badges. An old worker, upon receiving the red "Quotations from Chairman Mao," was so moved that tears of happiness flowed down his face. He took out a book of Stalin's works that he had read many times from his pocket and gave it back to the Chinese sailors. He said sadly, "In our place, anyone who reads Stalin's books or speaks well of Stalin is often arrested and sent to jail, and some are even labeled as 'crazy' and sent to mental hospitals without reason." He firmly declared, "No matter how rampant those wolves are, they cannot shake the red hearts of the Soviet people who remember Stalin and yearn for Mao Zedong!"

The next day, this elderly Soviet worker specially came to the Chinese cargo ship and gave the Chinese sailors a cigarette box. On the cigarette box, there were two sentences expressing the wishes of millions of laboring people in the Soviet Union: "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Long live Sino-Soviet friendship!" The Chinese sailors also enthusiastically gave him a Mao Chairman badge. The old worker jumped up excitedly, shouting, "Hurrah, Mao Zedong!" "Beijing, Mao Zedong!" and then respectfully pinned the Mao Chairman badge to his inner clothing, leaving the dock with an excited heart.

Long Live Chairman Mao Forever!

One night, at a port in a certain place in the Soviet Union, an unemployed old Soviet worker, avoiding the tailing "tail," approached a Chinese cargo ship that was docked there and softly told the Chinese sailors, "Please give me a Russian edition of 'Quotations from Chairman Mao.' She is the beacon we have been waiting for day and night." The Chinese sailors fulfilled his request. The old worker, holding the red treasure book with both hands, felt extremely happy and excited. He lowered his voice and shouted, "Hurrah, Mao Zedong!" "Hurrah, Beijing!" Then, he took out a portrait of Lenin and a portrait of Stalin that he had cherished for many years from his pocket as the most precious gift to give to the Chinese sailors.

This unemployed old worker enthusiastically praised Chairman Mao as the greatest leader of the proletariat in contemporary times. He said earnestly, "We are the good children of Lenin and Stalin, and the Soviet people love Mao Zedong." He then expressed his indignation at the evil rule of the Soviet revisionist traitor clique. He confidently declared, "We will rise up, fight, and let the red star over the Kremlin shine again." Before leaving, he tightly held the Chinese comrade's hand and sincerely wished Chairman Mao a long life!

    时刻怀念列宁斯大林　无限热爱毛主席
    苏联革命人民憎恶苏修叛徒集团的统治
    新华社五日讯　具有光荣革命传统的苏联革命人民打从心眼里憎恶苏联修正主义叛徒集团的统治。他们时刻怀念列宁和斯大林，无限热爱毛主席。苏联革命人民的这种心情在他们的言行中不时地流露出来。
    怀念斯大林，热爱毛泽东！
    一天，在中国某地一个民航机场的候机室里，毛泽东思想文艺宣传队正在为途经那里的外国朋友表演文艺节目。一批等候飞机的苏联旅客在其领队的监视下，显得缄默而拘束，他们坐在候机室里漫不经心地翻阅着杂志。但是，他们的注意力被宣传队的精采表演所吸引。当演出《毛泽东思想放红光》的节目时，有的苏联旅客情不自禁地用脚在地上轻轻地踏着节拍；在宣传员放声高唱《斯大林颂》时，他们一个个都全神贯注，十分激动，有的连手中拿着的杂志也不知不觉地滑到地上。其中一个五十多岁的苏联旅客，借点烟的机会，暗自擦掉了盈眶的热泪。歌声刚落，好几个苏联旅客无所顾忌地同其他外国旅客一起，热烈地鼓起掌来。
    一位苏联老人怀着激动的心情，悄悄地对一个中国翻译同志说：“我们苏联人民热爱毛泽东，怀念斯大林！”
      心　向　毛　主　席
    在我国某港口，有两个来到中国的苏联海员，每当他们看到中国工作人员胸前佩戴的金光闪闪的毛主席像章时，总是不断地向中国同志点头微笑。当他们从中国同志那里获得心爱的毛主席像章时，更是欢欣鼓舞，不知怎样才能表达自己无限幸福和无比激动的心情。他们小心翼翼地把毛主席像章别到内衣上，然后，对中国同志说：“苏联修正主义叛徒坏透了，他们反对中国，对毛泽东思想怕得出奇，不准我们读毛主席的书，不许戴毛主席像章。我们把毛主席像章戴在内衣上，是为了不被他们发现，也是为了让红太阳永远照亮我们的心房。”
    当这两名苏联海员从中国同志那里得到了他们迫切需要的红色宝书《毛主席语录》时，抑制不住内心的激动，他们向中国同志表示“苏联人民的心是向着毛主席的”。他们还表示一定要把毛泽东思想运用于革命实践，决心“推翻苏联修正主义的统治，重建无产阶级政权”。
      乌拉，毛泽东！
    有一次，一艘中国货船停泊在苏联的一个港口，许多苏联装卸工人不顾警察的阻拦，跑上货船向中国海员索取革命宝书《毛主席语录》和毛主席像章。有一位老工人得到红彤彤的《毛主席语录》时，激动得流下了幸福的热泪。他从怀里掏出一本自己曾经读过许多遍的斯大林著作，把它回赠给中国海员。他沉痛地说：“在我们这里，凡是读斯大林的书或者说斯大林好话的人，常常被抓去坐牢，有的还被当作‘疯子’，无辜地被送进了疯人院。”他坚定地表示：“不管那些豺狼们如何猖狂，都动摇不了苏联人民怀念斯大林、向往毛泽东的红心！”
    第二天，这位苏联老工人又特意来到中国货船上，赠给中国海员一个烟盒。烟盒上写着两句表达苏联千百万劳动人民意愿的心里话：“毛主席万岁！”“苏中人民友好万岁！”中国海员也热情地回赠了他一枚毛主席像章。这位老工人高兴得跳起来高呼：“乌拉，毛泽东！”“北京，毛泽东！”，并且马上恭恭敬敬地把毛主席像章别在内衣上，怀着激动的心情离开了码头。
        祝毛主席万寿无疆！
    一天深夜，在苏联某港口，一个失业的苏联老工人，避开盯梢的“尾巴”，走近停泊在那里的一艘中国货船，轻轻地向中国海员说：“请你送给我一本俄文版的《毛主席语录》，她是我们日夜盼望的明灯。”中国海员满足了他的要求。老工人双手捧着红色宝书，感到无比幸福和激动。他压低嗓门欢呼，“乌拉，毛泽东！”“乌拉，北京！”随后，他从怀里掏出珍藏了多年的一张列宁像和一张斯大林像，作为最珍贵的礼物赠送给中国海员。
    这位失业老工人对中国同志热情赞扬毛主席是当代无产阶级最伟大的领袖。他语重心长地说：“我们是列宁、斯大林的好儿女，苏联人民热爱毛泽东。”他接着对苏修叛徒集团的罪恶统治表示愤慨。他满怀信心地表示，“我们要翻身、要战斗，要让克里姆林宫上空的红星重放光芒。”临走时，他紧紧地握住中国同志的手，衷心祝愿毛主席万寿无疆！
