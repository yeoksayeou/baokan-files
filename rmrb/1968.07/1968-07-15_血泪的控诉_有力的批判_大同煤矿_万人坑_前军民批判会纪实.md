The "mass grave" of the Datong Coal Mine is filled with countless white bones, serving as a stark testament to the atrocities committed by imperialists, the Kuomintang reactionaries, and the bourgeoisie against coal miners. It is irrefutable evidence of the guilt of exploitation and heinous crimes. It reminds us of the deep sufferings endured by the laboring people and helps us understand the immense happiness of following the great leader Chairman Mao in revolution.

The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "Never forget class struggle." Comrade Lin Biao also teaches us: "If you do not understand what class is, if you do not understand what exploitation is, you do not understand revolution."

After liberation, the "mass grave" became a grand classroom for class education, and the white bones of the deceased miners became living teaching materials. During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the "mass grave" became a venue for revolutionary criticism. Every day, groups of revolutionary cadres, Red Guards, and PLA soldiers would come here to pay their respects to the deceased miners and denounce the reactionary fallacies of "exploitation is beneficial" propagated by China's Khrushchev.

One afternoon, members of the Revolutionary Committee of the Red Third Mine of the Datong Coal Mine, military representatives, leftist support troops, revolutionary workers, revolutionary family members, and Red Guards gathered in front of the "mass grave," filled with loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao and his revolutionary line, and with deep hatred for the old society and China's Khrushchev. They held a military and civilian criticism meeting to accuse China's Khrushchev of his counter-revolutionary crimes.

The criticism meeting began with the accusations of the old worker Wang Fudian against the old society and China's Khrushchev.

In the old society, coal mines were like hell on earth, and miners were treated worse than cattle. Every day, they would go down into the mines at the first crow of the rooster and return at moonrise. In the dark, hot, and humid small coal pits, under the whips of the foremen and mine police, miners would dig coal with their hands and carry it on their backs. They would work for fourteen or fifteen hours a day, barely getting enough to eat from rotten vegetables and bean cakes, and they could not even find shelter in the leaky, open-air shacks. Every day, miners would be crushed, drowned, starved, or worked to death. Threatened and lured by imperialists, Kuomintang reactionaries, and capitalists, they came to the coal mines, only to be tortured until their backs were broken, their bones shattered, and their heads smashed, and then thrown into the "mass grave." In those days, it was truly said: "Once you enter the coal mine of Kouquan, you enter the mouth of wolves. If you want to go home, look for your bones in the mass grave." Wang Fudian, originally from Shandong, was tricked into coming to the Datong Coal Mine by capitalists in 1939. On the first day he arrived at the mine, his father was forced down into the pit to dig coal. In less than five days, he was tortured until his back was broken and his legs shattered. Seeing that they could no longer squeeze any more out of him, the capitalists had the corpse-carrying team drag his still-living father into the "mass grave." The nine-year-old Wang Fudian and his mother chased after the corpse-carrying team, crying and shouting desperately. His mother was knocked unconscious by a blow from a foreman, and Wang Fudian was also injured. The evil system of exploitation took the life of Wang Fudian's father, leaving the family destitute and forcing them to wander and beg on the streets. ... At this point, Wang Fudian could not hold back his tears. The audience was also moved to tears, their hearts filled with anger towards the evil old society and China's Khrushchev. Wang Fudian then pointed to the bones of the deceased miners in the "mass grave" and said indignantly: "Revolutionary comrades! Look at these deceased class brothers. Some have their limbs bent and backs broken, some have their heads smashed, and some have their hands bound with wire. Seeing this, who can remain indifferent? Who can forget this deep hatred? The 'mass grave' is a product of the exploitative system of the old society. Yet China's Khrushchev dares to say, 'The suffering of workers and peasants is that no one exploits them,' 'If you do not exploit others, you will suffer greatly.' Nonsense! These are the words of a landlord who eats people without spitting out the bones. Exploitation brings us workers and peasants only suffering and family destruction. We workers and peasants hate the evil system of exploitation to the core. Chairman Mao teaches us: 'Whoever stands on the side of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucrat capitalism is a counter-revolutionary.' China's Khrushchev, imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucrat capitalism are of one mind, singing the same tune and sitting on the same bench. He is an old counter-revolutionary, our sworn enemy. We must turn our hatred for the old society into strength and resolutely overthrow the agents of imperialism and the exploiting classes, China's Khrushchev, and make sure he never rises again."

The comrades present, upon hearing Wang Fudian's accusations, were all filled with righteous indignation and shouted in unison: "Remember the bitterness of class struggle, never forget the blood debt of hatred! Overthrow China's Khrushchev! Smash the old world to pieces!"

In the crowd, the PLA soldiers stood up, the Red Guards stood up, the revolutionary workers and family members stood up. They wanted to accuse the old society and denounce China's Khrushchev. The old worker Xu Youdian stepped forward first, saying angrily: China's Khrushchev dares to say that workers "welcome exploitation" and that capitalists "exploit for the benefit of others." I heard these words, and my lungs nearly burst with rage! In the old society, my family of six was tortured to death by three. The crimes of capitalist exploitation are endless. Exploitation brings us laboring people only family separation and destruction, it creates "mass graves" for us. China's Khrushchev dares to say, "Exploitation is beneficial," workers "welcome exploitation." This is sheer nonsense!

Xu Youdian's accusations further fueled everyone's hatred towards the old society and China's Khrushchev. The model soldier Guo Chenghai could no longer hold back, leaping to his feet and raising his iron fist, leading everyone in shouting: "Resolutely overthrow China's Khrushchev! Thoroughly criticize and expose the reactionary fallacy of 'exploitation is beneficial'!" He then accused: "My father was also a coal carrier in the old society, suffering greatly from the oppression and exploitation of the mine owners and foremen. My two sisters were taken from us by the evil old society. My family's experience is the same as that of the Datong Coal Mine workers, and it is the common experience of the billion laboring people of old China. In the old society, it was not just the Datong Coal Mine that had a 'mass grave'; many coal mines across the country had them. Today, on the lands that have not yet been liberated around the world, imperialism and its lackeys in various countries are creating 'mass graves' every day. The old society, the old world, is a vast 'mass grave'! China's Khrushchev's advocacy of the 'exploitation is beneficial' theory is to whitewash the exploiting classes, to rehabilitate the exploitative system, to attempt a capitalist restoration, and to re-enact the tragedy of the 'mass grave,' making us laboring people suffer twice and endure twice the hardships. We, the revolutionary workers armed with Mao Zedong Thought, will not agree to this, not even once!"

One speaker after another, each accusation was a blood-curdling indictment of the old society and a powerful criticism of China's Khrushchev. The intense anger could not be extinguished, and the deep class hatred could not be fully expressed. Everyone vowed to remember all the hatred and record it against the evil system of exploitation and against China's Khrushchev. Finally, the PLA soldiers, revolutionary workers, and Red Guards stood in front of the "mass grave" and made a resolute vow: "Following Chairman Mao, we will forever make revolution, overthrow China's Khrushchev, level all 'mass graves,' and carry the Chinese revolution and the world revolution to the end!"

    血泪的控诉　有力的批判
    ——大同煤矿“万人坑”前军民批判会纪实
    大同煤矿的“万人坑”，白骨累累，是帝国主义、国民党反动派和资产阶级残害煤矿工人的一个缩影，是剥削有罪、罪恶滔天的铁证。它告诉我们劳动人民经历过的深重苦难，它帮助我们认识今天紧跟伟大领袖毛主席干革命的无比幸福。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“千万不要忘记阶级斗争。”林副主席也教导我们：“不懂得什么是阶级，不懂得什么是剥削，就不懂得革命。”
    解放后，“万人坑”成了阶级教育的大课堂，死难矿工的累累白骨是阶级教育的活教材。在无产阶级文化大革命中，“万人坑”又成了革命大批判的场所。每天都有成群结队的无产阶级革命派、红卫兵小将、解放军指战员络绎不绝地来到这里，凭吊死难的矿工，痛斥中国赫鲁晓夫“剥削有功”的反动谬论。
    一天下午，大同煤矿红三矿革命委员会成员、军代表、支左部队指战员和革命职工、革命家属、红卫兵小将，满怀着对伟大领袖毛主席和毛主席革命路线的赤胆忠心，满怀对旧社会和中国赫鲁晓夫的刻骨仇恨，来到“万人坑”前，召开军民批判会，控诉中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命罪行。
    批判会在老工人王福田对旧社会和中国赫鲁晓夫控诉声中开始。
    旧社会的煤矿是个大地狱，矿工牛马不如。每天鸡叫头遍下井，顶着月亮收工。在阴暗闷热的小煤窑里，在把头、矿警队的皮鞭下，矿工们手刨炭，人背煤，每天劳动十四、五个小时，烂菜豆饼还吃不饱，四壁透风顶露天的工棚还住不上，每天都有被砸死、淹死、饿死和累死的矿工。他们在帝国主义、国民党反动派和资本家的威胁利诱下，来到煤矿，一批批被折磨得腰断、骨折、头烂，被扔进“万人坑”。那年月，真是：“到了口泉煤窑沟，进了豺狼口，要想回家，万人坑里找骨头。”王福田原籍山东，一九三九年被资本家骗到大同煤矿。到矿上的头一天他父亲被赶下井挖煤，不到五天就被折磨得腰折腿断。资本家见从他父亲身上再也榨不出油水，便让拉尸队把活着的父亲拖进“万人坑”。九岁的王福田和母亲拚命哭喊着追赶拉尸队，母亲被把头一棍子打昏在地，王福田也被打伤。万恶的剥削制度，夺去了王福田父亲的生命，使一家老少无依无靠，只好流离失所，沿街乞讨。……讲到这里，王福田泣不成声。会场上的人，个个流下了辛酸的眼泪，升起了对万恶的旧社会和中国赫鲁晓夫的满腔怒火。接着王福田指着“万人坑”中死难矿工的尸骨，愤慨地说：革命的同志们！看一看这些死难的阶级兄弟，他们有的四肢压弯腰压断，有的头部被砸碎，有的双手上捆绑着钢丝……。看到这些，谁能不咬牙切齿，谁能忘记这深仇大恨！“万人坑”是旧社会吃人的剥削制度造成的。可是中国赫鲁晓夫却胡说：“工人、农民的痛苦在于没有人剥削他们”，“不剥削人家就苦得很。”呸！这完全是吃人不吐骨头的地主老财说的话。剥削给我们工人农民带来的是苦难，是家破人亡。我们工人、农民恨透了万恶的剥削制度。毛主席教导我们：“什么人站在帝国主义封建主义官僚资本主义方面，他就是反革命派。”中国赫鲁晓夫和帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义穿的是一条裤子，唱的是一个调子，坐的是一条凳子，他就是个老反革命派，是我们的死敌，我们要把对旧社会的仇恨化为力量，坚决把帝国主义和剥削阶级的代理人中国赫鲁晓夫打翻在地，让他永世不得翻身。
    到会的同志听了王福田的控诉，个个义愤填膺，震天动地地高呼：“牢记阶级苦，不忘血泪仇！”“打倒中国赫鲁晓夫！彻底砸烂旧世界！”
    人群中，解放军指战员站起来了，红卫兵小将站起来了，革命职工、家属站起来了，他们要控诉旧社会，要痛斥中国赫鲁晓夫。老工人徐友田抢在前面，他愤怒地说：中国赫鲁晓夫胡说工人“欢迎剥削”，资本家“剥削有功”“剥削救人”，我听到这些黑话，肺都气炸了！在旧社会，我家六口人，活活被折磨死三口，资本家剥削的罪恶，几天几夜也诉不完。剥削给我们劳动人民带来的是妻离子散、家破人亡，剥削给我们造成的是“万人坑”，剥削救的是三大敌人。中国赫鲁晓夫胡说：“剥削有功”，工人“欢迎剥削”。真是混账透顶！
    徐友田的控诉更加激起了大家对旧社会和中国赫鲁晓夫的无比仇恨。五好战士郭成海再也忍耐不住了，霍地一下子从地上跳起来，抡起钢铁般的拳头，带领大家高呼：“坚决打倒中国赫鲁晓夫！”“彻底批倒批臭‘剥削有功’的反动谬论！”接着他控诉说：我的父亲在旧社会也是背煤的，饱受了窑主、把头的压榨和剥削，我的两个姐姐就是被万恶的旧社会夺去了生命。我家的遭遇和大同煤矿工人的遭遇一样，是旧中国亿万劳动人民的共同遭遇。在旧社会，不止大同煤矿有“万人坑”，全国许多煤矿都有“万人坑”。今天在全世界还没有解放的土地上，帝国主义和它在各国的走狗，天天都在制造“万人坑”。旧社会、旧世界就是一个最大的“万人坑”！中国赫鲁晓夫鼓吹“剥削有功”论，是为剥削阶级涂脂抹粉，是为剥削制度翻案，是妄想复辟资本主义，重演“万人坑”的悲剧，让我们劳动人民重吃二遍苦，再受二茬罪。我们用毛泽东思想武装起来的广大革命工人，一千个不答应，一万个不答应！
    发言的人一个接着一个，一个个的发言，都是对旧社会的血泪控诉，都是对中国赫鲁晓夫的有力批判。满腔的怒火烧不尽，阶级的深仇诉不完。大家表示，千仇万恨都要记在万恶的剥削制度的账上，都要记在中国赫鲁晓夫的账上。最后，解放军指战员、革命职工、红卫兵小将站在“万人坑”前，共同发出铿锵有力的誓言：“跟着毛主席，永远干革命，打倒中国赫鲁晓夫，踏平一切‘万人坑’，把中国革命和世界革命进行到底！”
