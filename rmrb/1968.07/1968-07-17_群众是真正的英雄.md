The masses are the true heroes.

Beijing Knitting Factory worker Zhang Caijin

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The people, and the people alone, are the motive force in the creation of world history."

The Chinese Khrushchev stands on the reactionary bourgeois standpoint, regarding himself as the "savior of the world," and treating the people as submissive "fools," attempting to ride roughshod over the people and do as he pleases.

In the play "Storm," Zhu Yongkang is the one who regards himself as the "savior" and comes to Huangni Township. Look, he "descends from the heavens, floating down," and as soon as he appears, he dispels the evil winds and mists with just a few words; as soon as he leaves Huangni Township, the demons and monsters immediately become rampant again. In short, without Zhu Yongkang, Huangni Township cannot function. It is this Zhu Yongkang who, as soon as he arrives in Huangni Township, arbitrarily convenes a party branch committee meeting, with everyone looking gloomy and no one speaking, ending in a dismal failure; it is this Zhu Yongkang who slanders the masses, saying that everyone has a "dependence mentality" and that "political backwardness is number one." Isn't all this a true reflection of the reactionary face of the Chinese Khrushchev, who regards the masses as "fools"?

Chairman Mao teaches us: The socialist revolution and socialist construction must adhere to the mass line, mobilize the masses, and launch mass movements.

The Chinese Khrushchev is extremely hostile to the broad revolutionary masses, regarding them as "mob" and "dregs," and claiming that "poor and lower-middle peasants do not tell the truth," and that "investigation meetings cannot uncover problems," loudly proclaiming that he wants to carry out "visits to the poor" and "rooting and linking" "secret work."

In the play "Storm," Zhu Yongkang does exactly what the Chinese Khrushchev does in "visits to the poor" and "rooting and linking." Obviously, this is to beautify the reactionary line of the Chinese Khrushchev as the correct line, and to use Zhu Yongkang's adherence to this line to achieve great "success" to whitewash the Chinese Khrushchev. The creators of "Storm" are indeed loyal servants of the Chinese Khrushchev!

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The masses harbor a great deal of socialist enthusiasm."

The Chinese Khrushchev views the working people with the eyes of the exploiting class, regarding the masses as "money-grubbers," and vigorously promoting the fallacies of "material incentives" and "profit in command."

The counter-revolutionary element Chen Dengke in "Storm" vigorously peddles these fallacies of the Chinese Khrushchev. Zhu Yongkang came to Huangni Township with 300,000 jin of grain. He treats this grain as a magic weapon, saying several times that it should be used at the "critical moment"; the cadres and masses of Huangni Township also eagerly look forward to this 300,000 jin of grain. It is precisely because this 300,000 jin of grain is used at the "critical moment" that Huangni Township changes from backward to "advanced." There is also the "mutual aid group" for weaving mats led by Zhu Yongkang, which is for doing a "thin profit, thick profit" business. Things like "the more you weave, the more money you make" and "making your hands more flexible," and so on. In a word, it is all for the sake of money. Isn't this the vivid embodiment of the fallacies of the Chinese Khrushchev?

The people are the creators of history, the true heroes. The dialectics of history tell us: Those who hate and oppose the masses will meet a bad end! The surging tide of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has not already brought about the doom of the Chinese Khrushchev and his ilk?

    群众是真正的英雄
    北京针织总厂工人  张才钦
    毛主席教导我们：“人民，只有人民，才是创造世界历史的动力。”
    中国赫鲁晓夫站在资产阶级反动立场上，把自己看成是“救世主”，把人民群众当做俯首帖耳的“阿斗”，妄想骑在人民头上胡作非为。
    《风雷》中的祝永康，就是以“救世主”自居来到黄泥乡的。请看，他“从天而降，飘飘而来”，一露面，只用了三言两语就打退了妖风迷雾；他一离开黄泥乡，牛鬼蛇神立刻又嚣张起来。总之，黄泥乡少了祝永康便万事行不通。就是这个祝永康，刚一来到黄泥乡就独断专行地召开党总支委员会，大家愁眉苦脸，都不发言，闹得不欢而散；就是这个祝永康，污蔑群众“人人都有依赖思想”，“政治落后也数第一”。这一切，难道不正是中国赫鲁晓夫视群众为“阿斗”的反动嘴脸的真实写照吗？
    毛主席教导我们：社会主义革命和社会主义建设，必须坚持群众路线，放手发动群众，大搞群众运动。
    中国赫鲁晓夫极端仇视广大革命人民群众，他把群众看作“群氓”和“渣滓”，胡说什么“贫下中农不说真话”，“调查会调查不出问题来”，大肆叫嚷什么要搞“访贫问苦”、“扎根串连”等“秘密工作”。
    《风雷》中的祝永康，在黄泥乡所干的就是中国赫鲁晓夫“访贫问苦”、“扎根串连”那一套。显然这是为了把中国赫鲁晓夫的资产阶级反动路线美化为正确路线，并以祝永康坚持这一路线而取得很大“成绩”来为中国赫鲁晓夫涂脂抹粉。《风雷》的炮制者不愧是中国赫鲁晓夫的忠实奴才！
    毛主席教导我们：“群众中蕴藏了一种极大的社会主义的积极性。”
    中国赫鲁晓夫用剥削阶级的眼光来看劳动人民，把群众看成“财迷”，大肆鼓吹“物质刺激”、“利润挂帅”的谬论。
    反革命分子陈登科在《风雷》中就极力贩卖中国赫鲁晓夫这种谬论。祝永康到黄泥乡，是带着三十万斤粮食去的。他把这些粮食当作法宝，几次说要用在“刀口”上，“节骨眼”上；黄泥乡的干部、群众也都眼巴巴地望着这三十万斤粮食。正是由于这三十万斤粮食用在“刀口”上了，黄泥乡便从落后变为“先进”。还有祝永康领导下搞的什么编席“互助组”，也是为了做一笔“本薄利厚”的生意，什么“编的多，多赚钱”啊，什么使“手头活泛些”啊，等等。一句话，就是为了钱。这难道不是中国赫鲁晓夫那套谬论的形象化吗？
    人民群众是历史的创造者，是真正的英雄。历史的辩证法告诉我们：仇视群众、反对群众的家伙，决没有好下场！无产阶级文化大革命群众运动的滚滚洪流，不是已经使中国赫鲁晓夫之流遭到灭顶之灾了吗！
