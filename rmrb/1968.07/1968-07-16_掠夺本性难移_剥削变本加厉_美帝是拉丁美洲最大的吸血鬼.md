For a long time, U.S. imperialism has used various means to control the economic lifelines of Latin American countries, carrying out cunning and brazen exploitation and plunder.

		Cunning and Brazen Plunder, No Stone Unturned

In recent years, U.S. monopolistic capital has intensified its infiltration into the important economic sectors of Latin American countries, especially the strategic resources sectors. Not long ago, the U.S.-owned Texaco Oil Company seized the rich oil fields in the Putumayo region of Colombia, occupying four million acres of leased land. According to the Ecuadorian newspaper "En Marcha," the U.S.-owned Texaco and another U.S. company, Gulf Oil, have openly seized over five million acres of leased land in eastern Ecuador, preparing to exploit the oil in this region. These two companies also plan to seize 94% of Ecuador's oil production rights. The U.S. monopolistic capital companies Anaconda and Braden control over 90% of Chile's copper mining. They squeeze out profits of over $100 million each year.

		Exporting Capital, Reaping Huge Profits

In recent years, U.S. imperialism has been exporting capital to various Latin American countries on a large scale, reaping huge profits. According to materials recently published by the U.S. Department of Commerce, in 1967, U.S. investments in Latin America reached $1.435 billion, an increase of approximately $400 million compared to 1965. U.S. monopolistic capital currently has total investments of over $1 billion in Chile alone. According to official statistics published by Chile, in 1966, the main foreign enterprises in Chile, which are mostly American, earned profits of $90 million, and in 1967, this increased to $110 million.

U.S. imperialism also uses loans and debts to carry out usurious exploitation and ruthless plunder of Latin American countries.

		Selling High, Buying Low, Harming Others for Self-Gain

To shift the crisis, in trade relations with Latin American countries, U.S. imperialism strives to maintain and intensify the imperialist policy of selling high and buying low, unequal exchange. As early as 1966, due to the sluggish markets in the U.S. and Western Europe, Latin American countries' export products have been in a state of "surplus" and falling prices. Coffee, which accounts for one-quarter of Latin America's total exports, has been severely overproduced due to lack of sales. Brazil alone has enough coffee stockpiles to supply the international market for one year and three months. This has seriously affected the fiscal revenues of countries like Brazil and Colombia, which rely on coffee exports for their main foreign exchange earnings. Argentina and Uruguay, the main exporters of agricultural and livestock products and meat, have also seen their incomes greatly reduced due to falling meat prices on the international market and U.S. imperialism's suppression of import prices. Chile, where copper exports account for 61% of foreign exchange earnings, has seen its international trade revenue greatly reduced due to the drop in copper prices from 70 cents per pound in 1966 to 46 cents per pound last year.

		Sucking the Marrow, People Suffering

Under the ruthless exploitation and plunder of U.S. imperialism, the economic situation in Latin America continues to deteriorate. Many countries face rising international trade deficits and shrinking foreign exchange reserves. Latin American countries are generally experiencing economic contraction, rising prices, currency devaluation, increasing unemployment, and widespread suffering. For example, Brazil, which already has $3.5 billion in external debt, had to borrow an additional $610 million at the beginning of this year to support its foreign exchange reserves, which are at a "dangerous point." Chile, with $2.3 billion in external debt, has consistently seen trade deficits. Foreign exchange reserves decreased by $70 million from the end of 1966 to August 1967. The international trade deficits of Latin American countries last year reached $1.6 billion, the highest in the 1960s.

In Argentina, under the rule of a pro-U.S. dictatorship, living expenses increased by 30% last year, and unemployment reached 800,000, about 10% of the national workforce. The Onganía government in Argentina devalued the national currency by 40% in March last year. The Brazilian government devalued the new currency issued in February last year by 18.5% at the beginning of this year; by June, prices had risen by 14.1%, and the domestic budget deficit had reached $600 million.

Last year, living expenses in Chile increased by 26%. The Chilean currency has been devalued 13 times from the beginning of this year to mid-July. Last year, living expenses in Uruguay increased by 136%, and by May this year, living expenses had risen by nearly 49%.

Great leader Chairman Mao pointed out: "Imperialism has prepared the conditions for its own destruction. The awakening of the masses of the people in the colonies and semi-colonies and the masses of the people in the imperialist countries themselves is such a condition. Imperialism drives the masses of the people of the whole world to the great struggle to eliminate imperialism."

Recently, the mass struggles against the U.S. and dictatorships that have erupted in Brazil, Uruguay, Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Venezuela, Bolivia, Peru, and other Latin American countries indicate the new awakening of the Latin American people.

    掠夺本性难移　剥削变本加厉
    美帝是拉丁美洲最大的吸血鬼
    据新华社十四日讯　长期以来，美帝国主义通过各种手段，控制了拉美各国的经济命脉，进行巧取豪夺的剥削和掠夺。
          巧取豪夺　无孔不入
    近几年来，美国垄断资本又加紧渗入拉美各国的重要经济部门，特别是战略物资部门。不久以前，美资德士古石油公司霸占了哥伦比亚的普图马约地区的丰富油田，占领了四百万英亩的租让地。据厄瓜多尔《在前进报》揭露，美资德士古和另一家美资海湾石油公司公开侵占了厄瓜多尔东部五百多万英亩的租让地，准备开采这个地区的石油。这两家公司还计划攫取厄瓜多尔石油产量的百分之九十四的开采权。美国垄断资本的安那康达和布拉登两家铜公司控制了智利百分之九十以上铜的开采量。它们每年榨取的利润达一亿美元以上。
            输出资本　牟取暴利
    美帝国主义近几年来大肆向拉丁美洲各国输出资本，牟取巨额利润。据美国商务部不久前公布的材料，一九六七年美国对拉丁美洲的新投资达十四亿三千五百多万美元，比一九六五年增加了约四亿美元。美国垄断资本目前仅在智利的总投资就已经达到十亿美元以上。据智利官方公布的统计数字，一九六六年，在智利的主要属于美国的外国企业所获得的利润是九千万美元，而在一九六七年增加到一亿一千万美元。
    美帝国主义还通过贷款、放债，对拉美各国进行高利盘剥和残酷掠夺。
          贵卖贱买　损人利己
    美帝国主义为了转嫁危机，在同拉美国家贸易关系中，竭力维护与加紧推行贵卖贱买、不等价交换的帝国主义掠夺政策。早在一九六六年，由于美国和西欧国家市场萧条，拉美各国出口产品一直处于“过剩”和价格下跌的状况。占拉美出口总值四分之一的咖啡，因缺乏销路，生产“过剩”极端严重，单是巴西一国的咖啡存货量，就可供应国际市场一年零三个月的销售量。这使以出口咖啡为外汇主要收入的巴西、哥伦比亚等国的财政收入受到严重影响。阿根廷和乌拉圭这两个主要出口农牧产品和肉类的国家，也因国际市场的肉价下跌和美帝国主义压低进口价格而收入大大减少。出口铜占外汇收入百分之六十一的智利，由于铜价从一九六六年每磅七十分，跌到去年每磅四十六分，使得国际贸易收入大大减少。
            敲骨吸髓　民不聊生
    拉丁美洲在美帝国主义的残酷剥削和掠夺下，经济状况日益恶化，许多国家国际收支逆差不断上升，外汇储备一再减缩。拉美各国普遍出现生产萎缩、物价上涨、货币贬值、失业人数激增、民不聊生的灾难。例如，已经负有外债三十五亿美元的巴西，今年年初又不得不借新债六亿一千万美元，来支撑处于“危险点”的外汇储备。智利负有二十三亿美元的巨额外债，国际收支一直出现赤字。外汇储备从一九六六年底到一九六七年八月，减缩了七千万美元。拉美各国去年国际收支赤字达十六亿美元，这是六十年代拉美各国国际收支赤字的最高点。
    在亲美独裁政权统治的阿根廷，去年生活费用上涨了百分之三十，失业人数达八十万人，约占全国劳动力百分之十。阿根廷翁加尼亚政府去年三月再次把本国货币贬值百分之四十。巴西政府今年年初又把去年二月发行的新币贬值百分之十八点五；到今年六月份为止，物价已经上涨了百分之十四点一，国内预算赤字已达六亿美元。
    去年，智利生活费用上涨了百分之二十六。智利货币从今年年初至七月上旬为止，已连续十三次贬值。去年乌拉圭生活费用上涨了百分之一百三十六，今年截至五月为止，生活费用又上涨了近百分之四十九。
    伟大导师毛主席指出：“帝国主义给自己准备了灭亡的条件。殖民地半殖民地的人民大众和帝国主义自己国家内的人民大众的觉悟，就是这样的条件。帝国主义驱使全世界的人民大众走上消灭帝国主义的伟大斗争的历史时代。”
    最近，巴西、乌拉圭、阿根廷、智利、哥伦比亚、厄瓜多尔、委内瑞拉、玻利维亚、秘鲁以及其他拉美国家爆发的反美反独裁的群众斗争，表明了拉丁美洲人民的新觉醒。
