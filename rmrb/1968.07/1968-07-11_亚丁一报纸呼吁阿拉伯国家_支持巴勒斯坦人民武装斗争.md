A Yemeni newspaper calls on Arab countries to support the armed struggle of the Palestinian people

	Newspaper of the People's Republic of China, July 11, 1968

	The Arabic-language newspaper "October 14" published in Aden issued a commentary on July 7 calling on Arab countries to mobilize all material, military, and political forces to support the armed struggle of the Palestinian people.

	The commentary said that the escalation of the armed struggle of the Palestinian people against Israeli occupation once again proves that the expansionist dream of Israel will never be realized.

	The commentary pointed out that in the past year, the Palestinian resistance movement has achieved brilliant victories. Today, as the armed struggle of the Palestinian people continues to escalate, Israel, which has long dreamed of forcing Arab countries to negotiate with it, is in a difficult situation.

	The commentary calls on Arab countries to mobilize all material, military, and political forces to support the armed struggle of the Palestinian people until the occupied Arab lands and the Palestinian people are liberated.
