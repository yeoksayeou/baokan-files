Loyal to Chairman Mao, Follow the Path of Emphasizing Proletarian Politics

Create Four Good Units, Focus on the Thought Revolution of People

The unit where Comrade An Yemin served: In 1964, the counter-revolutionary revisionist element Luo Ruiqing stirred up a frenzy of large-scale competitions, vigorously promoting the fallacy that "military technical experts are the foundation of Four Good Units." At that time, some rumors also blew towards our unit, saying things like: "You are now only focusing on guarding the island and building the island, without emphasizing military training, you will suffer defeats in battles!" "The Four Good Unit will also be in vain." We openly resisted these ideas.

We believe that the primary condition for creating a Four Good Unit is to strengthen political and ideological construction. Only by arming ourselves with Mao Zedong Thought can people's enthusiasm and creativity be fully unleashed, and all work can be done well. Therefore, we especially paid attention to inspiring cadres and soldiers to establish a worldview of completely and thoroughly serving the people, to establish the idea of treating the island as home and honoring hardship, to carry out learning from heroes, and to encourage all comrades in the unit to be like An Yemin, to make up their minds to stay on the island forever, to have a heart for the motherland, and to guard the iron gate of the motherland, to be the red sentinels of Chairman Mao. Because we took emphasizing proletarian politics as the foundation of the unit's construction and used good political and ideological work to drive the other three aspects, we have continuously maintained the honorable title of Four Good Unit for seven years.

Communication Company 3 of a certain unit in the East China Sea Fleet: In 1964, the usurper and counter-revolutionary revisionist Luo Ruiqing stirred up a frenzy of large-scale competitions, crazily attacking politics and disrupting the Four Good Unit movement. Revolutionary soldiers armed with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought saw through his plot. We firmly remember Chairman Mao's teachings: "Without a correct political standpoint, it is like having no soul." No matter how fierce the "large-scale competitions" were, we firmly grasped the emphasis on proletarian politics and vigorously promoted the study and application of Chairman Mao's works. Comrades said: "You do your large-scale competitions, I will focus on studying Chairman Mao's works." By raising the level of people's ideological revolution, we drove the completion of combat readiness training and various tasks. That year, we were at the bottom in the "large-scale competitions," but in a battle to shoot down enemy planes, we completed the task relatively well, and five comrades were awarded military merits. At the end of the year, we continued to maintain the honorable title of Four Good Unit. All of this is the victory of emphasizing proletarian politics and the great Mao Zedong Thought.

United Efforts, Insist on People as the Primary Factor

Political Instructor Huang Shixin of Engineering Company 1 of a certain unit in the South China Sea Fleet: The counter-revolutionary revisionist elements, China's Khrushchev and Luo Ruiqing, advocated the fallacy that "technology determines everything," completely denying the role of people, which is extremely absurd. We have many practical experiences in this regard. In the first half of 1966, we accepted a new task. This task was technically complex and had high precision requirements. At that time, our unit did not have technical workers, but comrades thought that this was a task given by Chairman Mao, and everyone decided to fight for Chairman Mao and for the Cultural Revolution. Someone said: "A feather cannot fly to the sky!" Comrades in our unit responded loudly: "With a heart loyal to Chairman Mao, we will make the feather fly to the sky!" Comrades, relying on the wisdom and strength given by Mao Zedong Thought, dared to innovate and united efforts, completing the task ahead of schedule by more than half, proving that soldiers armed with Mao Zedong Thought and practical experience are the smartest and most talented. "The masses are the real heroes."

Party Branch of Ship 388: In October 1963, we accepted a distant voyage and rescue mission. At that time, we had just started military training, the personnel were new, the equipment was new, and there were few technical cadres. In this situation, what should we focus on first? The party branch firmly remembered Chairman Mao's consistent teaching that political work is the lifeline of our army, and did political work for every individual. Therefore, all officers and soldiers could firmly guard their positions and continue working in the face of strong winds and waves, and also confronted the warships and seaplanes of American imperialism for more than two hours, forcing the enemy to flee in disarray. After twelve days and nights of hard work, we finally completed the task successfully.

Practice has made us deeply feel: Technology is controlled by people. People are the decisive factor. According to the counter-revolutionary revisionist Luo Ruiqing's method of "military first," burying oneself in technology and military training every day will inevitably become a confused fool, and will desert in the face of battle. Emphasizing politics, soldiers armed with Mao Zedong Thought have red hearts and bright eyes, are the bravest, and have the greatest perseverance, can overcome all difficulties, and make technology play its greatest role.

Emphasizing Proletarian Politics is the Source of All Victories

Company 2 of Unit 186 of the Navy: We want to use our personal experiences to refute China's Khrushchev's reactionary fallacies of "technology first" and "military first." We are responsible for sea production tasks. In recent years, we have always regarded Chairman Mao's books as the highest instructions for all work. The busier the tasks, the more we insist on learning, and the more we strengthen political and ideological work. In this way, the political atmosphere is thick, the sense of responsibility to the people is greatly enhanced, and the production tasks are completed well. Since the Cultural Revolution, we have continuously carried out revolutionary criticism, exposing the heinous crimes of Peng Dehuai and Luo Ruiqing in promoting the bourgeois military line, raising the awareness of the struggle between the two lines, and deepening the deep class feelings of being infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao. After Chairman Mao's great call to "grasp revolution, promote production, promote work, and promote preparedness," we are all full of fighting spirit, rushing to the front line, and always ensuring the safety of the boat. The experience of recent years has made us deeply understand that following Chairman Mao, emphasizing proletarian politics, is victory; emphasizing technology and relaxing political and ideological work will lead to the wrong path.

Political Instructor Chen Mingben of Company 6 of a certain unit in the South China Sea Fleet Air Force: The counter-revolutionary revisionist Luo Ruiqing advocated "four good aspects are equal, taking turns to emphasize," which is a thorough revisionist fallacy. The four aspects of the Four Good Unit are an integral part of the unit's construction, but there is a main and a secondary, and they cannot be equal. Politics is always the commander. We must use good political and ideological work to command and drive the other three aspects. The so-called military and politics "taking turns to emphasize" is essentially to emphasize military and promote "military first."

Chairman Mao teaches us: Politics is the commander, the soul. Our unit insists on the principle of political construction of the army in creating the Four Good Unit, and puts political and ideological work in the first place. We insist on using Mao Zedong Thought to command military training, adopting the method of training with Chairman Mao's teachings, with class hatred, with enemy situations, and with the heavy responsibility of the world revolution, doing a good job of ideological mobilization before training, on-site mobilization during training, and evaluation after training, greatly improving the training quality. In 1965, under the condition that the vast majority of our unit were new soldiers, due to emphasizing proletarian politics, the political awareness of new soldiers was quickly raised, and military training also achieved excellent results.

Logistics Company of Unit 1212: Where should emphasizing proletarian politics be implemented? The answer of the counter-revolutionary revisionist Luo Ruiqing is to implement it in business. This is a deceitful lie. In the early days of the unit's establishment, we mistakenly believed that the main task of the warehouse logistics company was to stand guard, receive and send, and do construction work, as long as the tasks were completed, creating the Four Good Unit would be no problem. Under the control of this idea, the party branch only regarded political and ideological work as ensuring the completion of tasks, and the four firsts became four seconds. As a result, the Four Good Unit was not achieved for three years. Why is this? Chairman Mao teaches us: Politics is the commander, the soul. Limiting political and ideological work to ensuring the completion of tasks, not insisting on using politics to command everything, and neglecting to do a good job of people's ideological work, will inevitably lead to the wrong path. After learning from this lesson, the party branch vigorously promoted the study and application of Chairman Mao's works, carried out a thorough ideological revolution of people, raised people's awareness, and effectively promoted combat readiness. All work was completed relatively well. It can be seen that all work must insist on proletarian politics taking the lead, and emphasizing proletarian politics should be implemented in the ideological revolution of people. In 1965, our unit fought a complete victory, entered the ranks of the Four Good Unit, and was continuously evaluated as the Four Good Unit for three years. Comrades excitedly said: Mao Zedong Thought is our lifeline, and Comrade Lin's instructions on emphasizing politics are our guiding light.

### 无限忠于毛主席，走突出无产阶级政治的道路

    无限忠于毛主席，走突出无产阶级政治的道路
    创造四好，狠抓人的思想革命化
    安业民烈士生前所在连队：一九六四年，反革命修正主义分子罗瑞卿刮起大比武的妖风，极力宣扬军事技术尖子“就是四好连队的基础”的谬论。这时，一些流言蜚语也向我们连吹来，说什么：你们“现在这样只是一味抓守岛建岛教育，不突出一下军事训练，将来打起仗来是要吃败仗的！”“四好连队也要落空”。对于这些，我们公开地进行了抵制。
    我们认为，创造四好连队，首要的一条，是加强政治思想建设。只有用毛泽东思想武装头脑，人的积极性、创造性才能发挥出来，各项工作才能做好。因此我们特别注意启发干部战士树立完全彻底为人民服务的世界观，树立以岛为家，以苦为荣的思想，开展向英雄学习的活动，鼓舞全连同志要象安业民那样，下定永远扎根海岛的决心，胸怀祖国，眼望全球，把好祖国钢铁大门，当好毛主席的红色哨兵。由于我们把突出无产阶级政治作为连队建设的基础，以政治思想好带动其他三好，因此连续七年保持了四好连队的光荣称号。
    东海舰队某部通信三连：一九六四年，篡军反党分子罗瑞卿刮起大比武的妖风，疯狂地冲击政治，破坏四好连队运动。用战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装起来的革命战士看穿了他的阴谋。我们牢记毛主席的教导：“没有正确的政治观点，就等于没有灵魂。”“大比武”的妖风刮得再凶，我们紧紧抓住突出无产阶级政治不放，大抓狠抓活学活用毛主席著作。同志们说：“你搞你的大比武，我抓我的毛主席著作学习。”提高人的思想革命化，带动了战备训练和各项工作任务的完成。这一年，“大比武”我们是倒数第一，可是在一次击落敌机的战斗中，却比较圆满地完成了任务，五位同志荣立了战功。年终，继续保持了四好连队的光荣称号。这都是突出无产阶级政治，突出伟大的毛泽东思想的胜利。
          群策群力，坚持人的因素第一
    北海舰队某部工兵一连指导员黄士鑫：中国赫鲁晓夫和反革命修正主义分子罗瑞卿鼓吹技术决定一切的谬论，完全否定人的因素，真是荒谬透顶。这方面我们有许多实际体会。一九六六年上半年，我们接受一项新任务，这项任务技术复杂，精度要求高。当时我们连没有技术工人，但同志们想到，这是毛主席交给我们的任务，大家下决心要为毛主席争气，为无产阶级文化大革命争气。有人说：“鸡毛上不了天！”我们连的同志响亮地回答：“凭着一颗忠于毛主席的红心，我们定叫鸡毛飞上天！”同志们就是凭着毛泽东思想给予的智慧和力量，大胆革新，群策群力，提前一半以上时间出色地完成了任务。事实证明，用毛泽东思想武装起来的有实践经验的战士最聪明、最有才干，“群众是真正的英雄”。
    三八八舰党支部：一九六三年十月，我们接受了远航抢险任务。当时，刚刚开始军事训练，人员新、装备新、技术骨干少，在这种情况下执行艰巨任务，首先抓什么？党支部牢记毛主席的政治工作是我军的生命线的一贯教导，把政治工作做到每一个人身上。因此，全体指战员在大风大浪中都能坚守战位，坚持工作，并且同美帝国主义的军舰和水上飞机对峙两个多小时，逼使敌人狼狈逃窜。经过十二昼夜的艰苦奋战，我们终于圆满地完成了任务。
    实践使我们深深地感到：技术是由人掌握的。人是决定的因素。按照反革命修正主义分子罗瑞卿“军事第一”的办法，整天埋头钻技术、练军事，必然会成为迷失方向的糊涂虫，打起仗来就会临阵脱逃。突出政治，用毛泽东思想武装起来的战士，心红眼亮，最勇敢，也最有毅力，能克服一切困难，使技术发挥最大的作用。
    突出无产阶级政治，是取得一切胜利的源泉
    海字一八六部队二中队：我们要用亲身的经历痛斥中国赫鲁晓夫“技术第一”、“军事第一”的反动谬论。我们担负海上生产任务，几年来，都以毛主席的书当作各项工作的最高指示。任务越忙，越要坚持学习，越要加强政治思想工作。这样，政治空气浓了，对人民负责的责任心大大加强了，生产任务也就完成得好。文化大革命以来，我们不间断地开展革命大批判，控诉了彭德怀和罗瑞卿推行资产阶级军事路线的滔天罪行，提高了两条路线斗争的觉悟，加深了无限忠于毛主席的深厚阶级感情。毛主席关于“抓革命，促生产，促工作，促战备”的伟大号召发出后，我们个个斗志昂扬，奔赴第一线，始终保证了艇的安全航行。几年来的经验，使我们深切地懂得，紧跟毛主席，突出无产阶级政治，就是胜利；突出技术，放松政治思想工作，就会走到邪路上去。
    南海舰队航空兵某部六连指导员陈明本：反革命修正主义分子罗瑞卿宣扬“四好并列，轮流突出”，这是彻头彻尾的修正主义谬论。四好的四个方面是连队建设的一个整体，但是有主有从，决不能并列，决不能同等看待。政治永远是统帅。我们必须以政治思想好来统帅和带动其他三好。所谓军事和政治“轮流突出”，实质上就是要突出军事，搞军事第一。
    毛主席教导我们：政治是统帅，是灵魂。我们连在创造四好中坚持政治建军的原则，把政治思想好放在首位。我们坚持用毛泽东思想去统帅军事训练，采取了带着毛主席的教导、带着阶级仇恨、带着敌情、带着世界革命的重任去练兵的办法，切实做好训练前的思想动员工作，训练中的现场鼓动工作，训练后的讲评工作，大大提高了训练质量。一九六五年，我们在全连绝大部分是新兵的情况下，由于突出无产阶级政治，新战士政治觉悟提高得很快，军训也取得了优秀的成绩。
    一二一二部队勤务连：突出无产阶级政治应落实到哪里？反革命修正主义分子罗瑞卿的回答是落实到业务。这是骗人的鬼话。建连初期，我们错误地认为，仓库勤务连的主要任务就是站岗、收发、搞营建，只要完成任务，创四好就没有问题。在这种思想支配下，党支部把政治思想工作仅仅看成是保证工作，四个第一变成四个第二。结果四好三年不沾边。这是为什么呢？毛主席教导我们：政治是统帅，是灵魂。把政治思想工作局限在保证任务完成上面，不坚持用政治来统帅一切，忽视做好人的思想工作，必然走上邪路。我们接受了这个教训以后，支部狠抓活学活用毛主席著作，大搞人的思想革命化，提高了人的觉悟，有力地促进了战备，各项工作都完成得较好。可见，一切工作都必须坚持无产阶级政治挂帅，把突出无产阶级政治落实到人的思想革命化上面。一九六五年，我们连彻底打了一个翻身仗，跨进了四好的行列，并连续三年被评为四好连。同志们兴奋地说：毛泽东思想是我们的命根子，林副主席突出政治的指示是我们的指路灯。
