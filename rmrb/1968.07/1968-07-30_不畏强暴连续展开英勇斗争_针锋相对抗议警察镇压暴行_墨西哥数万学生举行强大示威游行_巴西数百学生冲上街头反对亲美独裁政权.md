Students in Mexico bravely continue their struggle against brutal repression by the authorities.

On the 26th, tens of thousands of students in Mexico City held a massive demonstration, firmly demanding the disbandment of the "riot police" that suppress the people. The authorities dispatched a large number of police in an attempt to disperse the march. The students fought back, overturning cars to build barricades and using stones, bottles, and sticks as weapons to engage in fierce combat with the fully armed police.

According to reports, after the intense battle, the center of Mexico City was littered with stones, shattered glass windows, and broken bottles, along with several overturned and burned cars. The head of the secret police and a senior official from the city police department, who were personally directing the brutal violence, were also injured.

The "riot police" in Mexico had previously suppressed students at the National Polytechnic Institute, sparking widespread outrage among Mexican students. After the reactionary police brutally suppressed the students again on the 26th, Mexican students declared a general strike and insisted on the disbandment of the "riot police."

According to a report from Mexico City on the 29th, thousands of students in Mexico City continued their brave struggle on the 27th, protesting against the police's brutal suppression of students.

On the evening of the 27th, thousands of students in Mexico City occupied a vocational school and a college. The students used overturned cars to build barricades on nearby streets, cutting off traffic. In a statement, they demanded that the authorities disband the so-called "riot police," which are used to suppress the people, abolish the constitutional clause that prohibits people from participating in revolutionary struggles under the guise of "disturbing public order," and release those arrested during the massive student demonstration on the 26th. The students also demanded the resignation of the police chief and deputy chief who were directly responsible for suppressing the students.

On the evening of the 26th, tens of thousands of students in Mexico City held an eight-hour-long intense demonstration, protesting against the police suppression of the student movement and strongly demanding the disbandment of the "riot police." In this demonstration, eight students were martyred, over five hundred were injured, and hundreds were arrested. The students of Mexico City are extremely indignant at the police's brutality and are actively preparing for new struggles.

According to a report from the 28th, Brazilian students, who have long been fighting, recently broke through numerous difficulties and held consecutive rallies and demonstrations against the pro-American military dictatorship.

On the evening of the 25th, hundreds of students in Rio de Janeiro took to the streets, holding three rallies in the city center to protest against suppression and against the pro-American military dictatorship. The brave students also stormed into the Ministry of Labor, which is not far from the police headquarters, and wrote slogans against the military dictatorship on the walls, elevators, and staircases. Students in another major city, São Paulo, also held a series of protest demonstrations against the dictatorship on the 26th.
