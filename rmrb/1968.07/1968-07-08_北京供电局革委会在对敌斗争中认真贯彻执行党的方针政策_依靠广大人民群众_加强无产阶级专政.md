The Beijing Electric Power Bureau Revolutionary Committee, under the guidance of the great leader Chairman Mao, has been diligently executing the party's policies. With the assistance of the People's Liberation Army in supporting the left, it has united all possible forces, exposing a small group of long-hidden traitors, spies, die-hard capitalist-roaders, and other counter-revolutionaries. The masses say: The Revolutionary Committee is truly a strong fortress protecting the masses and a command center for striking the class enemy.

The Beijing Electric Power Bureau Revolutionary Committee, adhering to the teachings of the great leader Chairman Mao, has been meticulously implementing the party's policies. With the help of the People's Liberation Army in supporting the left, it has fully united and relied on the broad revolutionary masses, accurately and decisively striking a small group of class enemies, strengthening the dictatorship of the proletariat, and consolidating the newly established Revolutionary Committee.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Whether to protect or suppress the broad masses of the people is the fundamental difference between the Communist Party and the Kuomintang, the fundamental difference between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, and the fundamental difference between the dictatorship of the proletariat and the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie." The Revolutionary Committee, in leading the broad revolutionary masses to engage in the struggle against the enemy, has repeatedly studied and understood this great teaching of Chairman Mao. Everyone has deeply realized that the Revolutionary Committee must unconditionally expose and decisively strike a small group of class enemies, strictly handle them according to the policy of "leniency for those who confess and severity for those who resist." For the broad masses, the Revolutionary Committee must earnestly implement Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, firmly believe in the masses, rely on the masses, and wholeheartedly protect the masses. For those masses who have been deceived and made mistakes, the Revolutionary Committee must strictly demand ideological rectification while also uniting with them to jointly fight against the enemy.

	Hotly Support the Revolutionary Spirit of the Masses
	Resolutely Smash the Rightist Reversal Wind

After the establishment of the Revolutionary Committee of the Electric Power Bureau, the intense class struggle continued. The focus of the struggle remained the issue of political power. Before the establishment of the Revolutionary Committee, a small group of class enemies had been plotting to split the revolutionary ranks and sabotage the revolutionary great alliance and the revolutionary three-in-one combination. At this time, they were spreading the rightist reversal wind. They frantically advocated for themselves and their accomplices, directing their attacks at the Revolutionary Committee, the People's Liberation Army supporting the left, revolutionary leading cadres, revolutionary mass organizations, and the broad revolutionary masses of the proletariat, attempting to negate their direction of struggle. These bad elements spread rumors such as "certain revolutionary cadres are 'political thieves'" and "certain revolutionary mass organizations are 'true conservatives,'" and so on. For a time, some masses who were not clear about the truth were also deceived.

The proletarian revolutionaries and the broad revolutionary masses were very clear and indignant about the enemy's plot to reverse the verdict. The Electric Meter Room of the Power Usage Department was the first unit in the entire bureau to establish a revolutionary three-in-one leadership group, and the class enemies also started their mischief here first. At that time, the revolutionary comrades of the Electric Meter Room, who were studying in a training class, were filled with righteous indignation and posted the first big-character poster to counterattack, using Chairman Mao's latest instructions as a weapon to expose and criticize the class enemies' plot to reverse the verdict. The Revolutionary Committee of the Power Usage Department immediately expressed support for the big-character poster of the revolutionary masses and joined the masses in the battle. Soon, the Revolutionary Committee of the bureau launched a high tide of counterattacking the rightist reversal wind throughout the bureau, leading the broad masses to launch a fierce attack on the class enemies. The members of the Revolutionary Committee went to the front lines of the struggle, serving as both fighters and propagandists, and commanders, supporting the masses and commanding the masses in battle.

The Revolutionary Committee of the Electric Power Bureau believes that at any time, it is necessary to support the revolutionary movement of the masses and not to dampen the revolutionary enthusiasm of the masses. After the struggle against the enemy began, some masses did not fully understand the power of the policy, and sometimes their methods of struggle were a bit simplistic. The comrades of the Revolutionary Committee, seeing this situation, did not adopt a dampening attitude towards the masses but went deep into the grassroots, summarized the experience of accurately and decisively striking the enemy in a unit, and then widely publicized and promoted it. In this way, the revolutionary enthusiasm of the masses was fully mobilized, and the level of struggle was raised.

After the rightist reversal wind was quickly smashed, the Revolutionary Committee did not give the enemy any breathing room but immediately mobilized the masses to purify and consolidate the class ranks in an organized and step-by-step manner, exposing a small group of long-hidden traitors, spies, die-hard capitalist-roaders, and other counter-revolutionaries.

	Maximize the Mobilization and Unity of the Masses
	Maximize the Isolation and Strike Against the Enemy

After the Electric Power Bureau Revolutionary Committee led the masses to engage in the struggle against the enemy, it was found that the class enemies had changed their counter-revolutionary strategies. They used the method of confusing two types of contradictions to disrupt our class lines, seeking survival in chaos, and then waiting for an opportunity to counterattack. They either stirred up trouble, inciting some uninformed masses to direct their attacks at those with general lifestyle or historical problems; or they incited bourgeois factionalism, attempting to cause confrontation between mass organizations to cover their retreat; or they took advantage of the opportunity for mass organizations to expose bad elements, attempting to completely negate the direction of the proletarian revolutionaries. The Revolutionary Committee of the bureau also found that some revolutionary masses had become impatient in the struggle against the enemy. Facing this extremely complex and sharp situation, the comrades of the Revolutionary Committee believed that at this time, the leadership must especially maintain a clear mind, on the one hand, be good at exposing the enemy's plots, and on the other hand, resolutely stand at the forefront of the masses, be good at arming the masses with Mao Zedong Thought, Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and the party's policies and strategies, guiding the masses to correctly distinguish and handle two types of contradictions. The Revolutionary Committee of the bureau immediately convened a full-bureau staff meeting, using the method of "driving a stake to the bottom" to give the party's policies to the masses in their entirety, and together with the masses, summarized the "eleven distinctions" for correctly handling two types of contradictions. Through the summary, the broad masses deeply understood Chairman Mao's great teaching that "policy and strategy are the lifeblood of the party," realizing the importance of strictly distinguishing between the two types of contradictions, paying attention to distinguishing between traitors, spies, and those with general historical problems, distinguishing between current counter-revolutionary activities and general erroneous remarks, and so on. Only in this way can the broad masses be better protected, and a small number of class enemies be severely struck. After the "eleven distinctions" were mastered by the revolutionary masses throughout the bureau, all possible revolutionary forces were united, and a small group of class enemies were severely struck.

The Revolutionary Committee of the Electric Power Bureau, in accordance with Chairman Mao's instruction to "firmly believe that the majority of the masses are good, and that bad people are a small number," went wholeheartedly to do the work of those deceived masses, including doing the work of those who had opposed them and had been proven by practice to have made mistakes, the heads of mass organizations. They regarded this as a struggle with the class enemy for the masses, and therefore, with great patience, they had individual talks with these people, invited them to study in training classes, and together with them, carried out self-criticism and criticism of revisionism, fundamentally raising their class consciousness and awareness of the two-line struggle. The deceived masses turned around and exposed the evil activities of the class enemies, returning to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Worker Shi Tianliang, who had earlier risen up to rebel against the capitalist-roaders, this time, due to being deceived, participated in a splinter group and was one of its leaders. After the splinter group collapsed, some masses wanted to criticize and struggle against him. The Revolutionary Committee conducted a class analysis of him, believing that he was a worker, his essence was good, and he had made a mistake due to being deceived for a moment, and should be educated and helped. Through in-depth political and ideological work, Shi Tianliang recognized his mistakes and turned around, continuing to be trusted by the revolutionary masses. The Revolutionary Committee resolutely implemented Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, putting Chairman Mao's instructions and the party's policies into practice among the masses, turning them into the conscious actions of the masses, thus maximizing the mobilization and unity of the masses and maximizing the isolation and strike against the enemy.

	Deeply Carry Out Revolutionary Criticism
	Completely Shatter the Enemy's Dream of Restoration

The Revolutionary Committee of the Electric Power Bureau summarized the experience of the previous period of struggle against the enemy, realizing that after exposing a small group of class enemies, if the mass revolutionary criticism was not further carried out, the enemy would still have the possibility of reversing the verdict and restoring the old order.

How to closely combine the purification of the class ranks with revolutionary criticism? The main responsible comrades of the Revolutionary Committee went to the front lines of the struggle with this question. They discovered the successful experience of a grassroots unit using the form of a workshop criticism meeting to thoroughly criticize and expose the class enemies. The masses of this unit used one or two quotations from Chairman Mao to criticize a reactionary point of the enemy, criticizing a reactionary fallacy of the Chinese Khrushchev. The masses reflected that this criticism "hit the vital points of the class enemies and dug out the black roots." This workshop criticism meeting had one content per session, the problem was concentrated, the time was short, and the masses could fully express their opinions. Many old workers, in the criticism meeting, used their personal experiences to denounce and criticize the crimes of the class enemies, achieving even better results. They held one workshop criticism meeting and summarized it once, learned from it once, continuously raising the class struggle consciousness and two-line struggle consciousness of the masses. The Revolutionary Committee of the bureau immediately convened an on-site meeting to promote the experience of carrying out revolutionary criticism in this unit throughout the bureau, quickly launching a high tide of revolutionary criticism throughout the bureau. In just one month, the entire bureau held more than 1,100 large and small criticism meetings. In this way, a small group of class enemies and their representative, the Chinese Khrushchev, were severely struck, becoming stinking to the core in the eyes of the masses.

The Revolutionary Committee of the Electric Power Bureau, in the struggle against the enemy, has always been at the forefront of the mass movement. The broad revolutionary masses have always maintained abundant enthusiasm and high morale, advancing victoriously along the course of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Many masses said: Our Revolutionary Committee is truly a strong fortress protecting the masses and a command center for striking the enemy.

    北京供电局革委会在对敌斗争中认真贯彻执行党的方针政策
    依靠广大人民群众　加强无产阶级专政
    在解放军支左人员的帮助下，团结一切可以团结的力量，揭露出一小撮长期隐藏下来的叛徒、特务、顽固不化的走资派和其他反革命分子。群众说：革委会真是保护群众的坚强堡垒，真是打击阶级敌人的战斗指挥部
    本报讯　北京供电局革命委员会，遵循伟大领袖毛主席的教导，认真执行党的政策，在解放军支左人员的帮助下，充分团结和依靠广大革命群众，稳准狠地打击一小撮阶级敌人，加强了无产阶级专政，巩固了新生的革命委员会。
    毛主席教导我们：“对广大人民群众是保护还是镇压，是共产党同国民党的根本区别，是无产阶级同资产阶级的根本区别，是无产阶级专政同资产阶级专政的根本区别。”局革委会在带领广大革命群众开展对敌斗争中，反复学习和领会毛主席的这一伟大教导。大家深刻地认识到，革委会对待一小撮阶级敌人，一定要无情揭露，坚决打击，根据“坦白从宽，抗拒从严”的政策，严肃处理，对于广大群众，一定要认真执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，坚决相信群众，依靠群众，满腔热情地保护群众；对于受蒙蔽犯了错误的群众，既要严格思想要求，也要团结他们共同对敌。
      热情支持群众革命精神
      坚决粉碎右倾翻案妖风
    供电局革委会成立以后，激烈的阶级斗争还在继续，斗争的焦点仍然是政权问题。革委会成立前，一小撮阶级敌人就在阴谋分裂革命队伍、破坏革命大联合和革命三结合，这时又大刮右倾翻案妖风。他们疯狂地为自己和同伙翻案而奔走呼号，把攻击的矛头指向革委会，指向支左的解放军，指向革命领导干部，指向革命群众组织，指向广大无产阶级革命派，妄图否定他们的斗争大方向。这些坏家伙散布什么某某革命干部是“政治扒手”，某某革命群众组织“才是真老保”，等等。一时间，一部分不明真相的群众也受了蒙蔽。
    无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众，对敌人的翻案阴谋十分清楚，非常气愤。用电处电度表室是全局第一个成立革命三结合领导小组的单位，阶级敌人也最先在这里兴风作浪。当时正在学习班学习的电度表室的革命同志义愤填膺，贴出第一张反击的大字报，以毛主席最新指示为武器，揭露和批判了阶级敌人搞翻案的阴谋。用电处革委会立即表示支持革命群众的大字报，并同群众一起投入战斗。不久，局革委会在全局范围内掀起了反击右倾翻案风的高潮，带领广大群众向阶级敌人展开猛攻。革委会成员深入斗争第一线，既当战斗员、宣传员，又当指挥员，给群众撑腰，指挥群众战斗。
    供电局革委会认为，在任何时候都要支持革命的群众运动，不能挫伤群众的革命积极性。对敌斗争展开以后，一部分群众对政策的威力认识不足，有时斗争方式有点简单。革命委员会的同志见到这种情况，对群众不是采取泼冷水的态度，而是深入基层，总结了一个单位稳准狠地打击敌人的经验，然后广泛宣传推广。这样，群众的革命积极性得到发挥，斗争水平也提高了一步。
    在右倾翻案风很快被粉碎以后，革委会不给敌人以喘息的机会，紧接着又放手发动群众，有领导、有步骤地纯洁和巩固阶级队伍，挖出了一小撮长期隐藏下来的叛徒、特务、顽固不化的走资派和其他反革命分子。
    最大限度地争取和团结群众
    最大限度地孤立和打击敌人
    北京供电局革委会领导群众展开对敌斗争以后，发现阶级敌人改变了反革命策略，他们采用了混淆两类不同性质矛盾的手法，企图搅乱我们的阶级阵线，在混乱中求得生存，然后伺机反扑。他们或者兴风作浪，煽动一些不明真相的群众把矛头指向有一般生活作风问题或一般历史问题的人；或者煽动资产阶级派性，企图挑起群众组织之间的对立，以掩护自己退却；或者利用群众组织揪坏人的机会，妄图全盘否定无产阶级革命派的大方向。局革委会同时发现一部分革命群众在对敌斗争中产生了一些急躁情绪。面对这种极为复杂、尖锐的情况，革委会同志认为，在这种时候，领导特别要保持清醒的头脑，一方面要善于识破敌人的阴谋，一方面要坚决站在群众的前头，善于用毛泽东思想、毛主席的革命路线和党的方针政策武装群众，引导群众正确区分和处理两类不同性质的矛盾。局革委会及时召开全局职工大会，用“一竿子插到底”的办法，把党的政策原原本本交给群众，同群众一起总结出正确处理两类不同性质的矛盾的“十一个区别”。通过总结，广大群众深刻领会了毛主席关于“政策和策略是党的生命”的伟大教导，认识到严格区别两类矛盾，注意把叛徒、特务和有一般历史问题的人区别开来，把现行反革命活动和一般错误言行区别开来等等，是十分重要的。这样才能更好地保护广大群众，打击极少数阶级敌人。“十一个区别”为全局革命群众掌握以后，团结了一切可以团结的革命力量，狠狠打击了一小撮阶级敌人。
    供电局革委会遵照毛主席“要坚决相信大多数群众是好的，坏人是极少数”的教导，满腔热情地去做那些受蒙蔽群众的工作，包括做那些反对过自己并且已被实践证明是犯了错误的群众组织头头的工作。他们把这看作是同阶级敌人争夺群众的斗争，因此以极大的耐心，找这些人个别谈心，吸收他们到学习班学习，同他们一起斗私批修，从根本上提高他们的阶级觉悟和两条路线斗争觉悟。受蒙蔽群众纷纷反戈一击，揭露了阶级敌人的罪恶活动，重新回到毛主席革命路线上来。工人史天良，曾经较早地起来造走资派的反，这次由于受蒙蔽参加了分裂组织，并且是其中的一个头头。分裂组织垮台后，一部分群众要批判斗争他。革委会对他进行了阶级分析，认为他是个工人，本质是好的，一时受蒙蔽犯错误，应当对他进行教育帮助。通过深入的政治思想工作，史天良认识了错误，转变过来了，继续受到革命群众的信任。革委会坚决贯彻了毛主席的革命路线，把毛主席的指示和党的方针政策落实到群众中间去，变为群众的自觉行动，就最大限度地争取和团结了群众，最大限度地孤立和打击了敌人。
      深入地开展革命的大批判
      彻底摧毁敌人复辟的迷梦
    供电局革委会总结了前段时间对敌斗争的经验，认识到揪出一小撮阶级敌人以后，如果不进一步开展群众性的革命大批判，把敌人从政治上、思想上、理论上彻底批倒、批臭，肃清其流毒，敌人就仍然存在翻案和复辟的可能。
    怎样把清理阶级队伍与革命大批判紧密结合起来？革委会主要负责人带着这个问题深入斗争第一线。他们发现一个基层单位用班组批判会的形式，批臭批倒阶级敌人的成功的经验。这个单位的群众用毛主席一两条语录，批判敌人一个反动论点，批判中国赫鲁晓夫一个反动谬论。群众反映这种批判“打中了阶级敌人的要害，挖出了黑根子”。这种班组批判会一次一个内容，问题集中，时间短，群众可以充分发言。许多老工人在批判会上，用亲身经历，控诉和批判阶级敌人的罪行，更收到了很好的效果。他们开一次班组批判会，就总结一次，学习一次，使群众的阶级斗争觉悟和两条路线斗争觉悟不断提高。局革命委员会立即召开现场会，向全局推广这个单位开展革命大批判的经验，很快在全局掀起革命大批判的高潮。仅在一个月的时间内，全局就开了大大小小的批判会一千一百多次。这样就使一小撮阶级敌人及其总代表中国赫鲁晓夫受到沉重打击，在群众中臭不可闻。
    供电局革委会在对敌斗争中始终站在群众运动的前头，广大革命群众一直保持着充沛的热情、高昂的斗志，沿着毛主席革命路线的航道胜利前进。许多群众说：我们的革委会真是保护群众的坚强堡垒，真是打击敌人的战斗指挥部。
