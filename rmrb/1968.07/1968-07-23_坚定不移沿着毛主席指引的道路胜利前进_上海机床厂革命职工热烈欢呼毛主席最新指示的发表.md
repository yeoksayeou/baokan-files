The great leader Chairman Mao's latest directive of great historical significance: "Universities must still be run. Here I am mainly talking about technical and vocational universities, which must still be run, but the school system must be shortened, education must be revolutionized, and proletarian politics must be in command, following the path of Shanghai Machine Tool Plant in cultivating technical personnel from among workers. Students should be selected from workers and peasants with practical experience, sent to school for a few years, and then return to production practice." This was conveyed to Shanghai last night. The heroic city by the Huangpu River was in an uproar! Shanghai Machine Tool Plant was in an uproar! Revolutionary workers, revolutionary technical personnel, Red Guards, and the broad revolutionary masses were overjoyed, carrying giant portraits of Chairman Mao and placards with Chairman Mao's latest directive, beating drums and gongs, and gathering from all directions to Shanghai Machine Tool Plant to report the good news to the workers of this plant and to express their boundless loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao. The revolutionary workers of Shanghai Machine Tool Plant were even more excited and stayed up all night. Workers from the early shift rushed back to the factory from their dormitories in the middle of the night; workers from the night shift stayed in the factory after their shift. With hearts full of boundless love for the great leader Chairman Mao, they held up the red revolutionary treasure book "Quotations from Chairman Mao," gathered in front of the statue of Chairman Mao, and sang "The East Is Red" and "Sailing the Seas Depends on the Helmsman" with great enthusiasm. The joyous songs echoed throughout the factory. At the factory gate, in the corridors, and in the workshops, large red banners were posted everywhere with the joyous news:

      "Warmest congratulations on the issuance of Chairman Mao's latest directive! The workers of Shanghai Machine Tool Plant will not disappoint Chairman Mao's expectations!"

      "Chairman Mao's latest directive speaks the heart of the working class. Chairman Mao supports us, and we will make Chairman Mao proud!"

      "We will definitely express our gratitude to the great leader Chairman Mao with practical actions!"

      "Long live the great leader Chairman Mao! Long live! Long live!"

Eleven years ago in July, the great leader Chairman Mao personally inspected Shanghai Machine Tool Plant, walking through one workshop after another, and warmly talking and shaking hands with the workers, giving the revolutionary workers of Shanghai Machine Tool Plant the greatest encouragement and impetus. The brilliant image of the great teacher Chairman Mao and Chairman Mao's great revolutionary practice of being close to the people have inspired the revolutionary workers of Shanghai Machine Tool Plant to advance bravely along the direction indicated by Chairman Mao in the years of struggle for socialist revolution and socialist construction.

Eleven years later, today, Chairman Mao, with his keenest observation and greatest courage as the greatest proletarian revolutionary, has summed up in the most profound and scientific way the experience created by the revolutionary workers of Shanghai Machine Tool Plant under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, issuing the latest directive of far-reaching historical significance. The revolutionary workers of Shanghai Machine Tool Plant feel immense happiness!

The entire factory's command center—the Revolutionary Committee—held expanded meetings at midnight and dawn to seriously study Chairman Mao's latest directive, sincerely thank Chairman Mao for his warm concern, and discuss specific measures to implement Chairman Mao's latest directive. Many workshops and departments held Mao Zedong Thought study classes to study Chairman Mao's latest directive overnight. Many workers gathered under the loudspeakers, writing down Chairman Mao's brilliant directive word by word, studying and deeply understanding it.

They said, Chairman Mao's great directive has greatly enriched and developed Marxism-Leninism. By advancing along the path indicated by Chairman Mao, we can fundamentally eliminate the evil phenomenon of "those who labor with their minds rule over those who labor with their strength" created by the exploiting classes over thousands of years, achieving the intellectualization of the laboring people and the laborization of intellectuals.

They said, Chairman Mao's great directive is the battle program for carrying the proletarian educational revolution through to the end, the action guideline for conducting struggle, criticism, and transformation on all fronts to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and the long-term plan for preventing and opposing revisionism, consolidating and strengthening the proletarian dictatorship, and ensuring that the proletarian state will never change color.

They said, by advancing bravely along the path indicated by Chairman Mao's brilliant directive, we can cultivate a powerful proletarian intellectual contingent and a large number of red and expert technical personnel, creating conditions for further carrying out industrial, agricultural, and scientific and technological revolutions, and building our country into a socialist power with modern industry, modern agriculture, modern national defense, and modern science and culture. With the wise leadership of the great leader Chairman Mao, the great Mao Zedong Thought, and the proletarian revolutionary line of Chairman Mao, and with a proletarian contingent that has mastered science and technology, our great socialist motherland will be even more prosperous and powerful.

With hearts full of excitement, the workers of Shanghai Machine Tool Plant recalled their struggle under the warm concern of Chairman Mao and the guidance of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. The great leader Chairman Mao has long clearly instructed us that we must have our own contingent of technical cadres. Chairman Mao's good student Comrade Ke Qingshi and the proletarian revolutionaries of Shanghai have firmly followed Chairman Mao's teachings, selecting and cultivating a large number of engineering and technical personnel from among the workers. The workers of Shanghai Machine Tool Plant deeply feel that their experience and achievements in cultivating technical personnel from among the workers are a great victory for Chairman Mao's proletarian educational line, a great victory for Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and a great victory for the invincible Mao Zedong Thought.

In the process of advancing along the path indicated by Chairman Mao to achieve victory, every step of the revolutionary workers of Shanghai Machine Tool Plant has been filled with the thrilling struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines. The Chinese Khrushchev and his agents Chen Pishan and Cao Qitai in Shanghai, along with the capitalist roaders within the factory, have used every means to interfere with the implementation of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, crazily advocating "experts running the factory," "technology first," and the "white expert road," and spreading bourgeois ideas of fame and profit and the reactionary fallacy of "those who labor with their minds rule over those who labor with their strength." The proletarian revolutionaries in the factory, under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, have engaged in a sharp struggle against this handful of class enemies. The famous labor model Zhang Meihua, who has seen the great leader Chairman Mao many times, is particularly excited today. This worker, who has made contributions to the development of China's mirror grinding technology, has suffered various difficulties and suppressions from the capitalist roaders and reactionary technical "authorities." Together with other technical personnel of worker origin, in the process of designing and trial-producing China's first ultra-advanced high-precision semi-automatic mirror grinding universal external grinding machine, the capitalist roaders and reactionary technical "authorities" used various excuses to not provide equipment, not provide instruments, not allow experiments, and adopted a bourgeois lordly attitude, mocking and ridiculing him, attempting to obstruct workers from ascending the stage of science and technology. Zhang Meihua and other workers, drawing great spiritual strength from Chairman Mao's works, persevered and fought tenaciously, finally scaling the peak of world science and technology.

Chairman Mao teaches: The fundamental question of revolution is the question of state power. The proletarian revolutionaries and the broad revolutionary masses of this factory deeply understand: In the past, the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents were able to interfere with the implementation of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line because they had usurped part of the leadership. In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution initiated and led by Chairman Mao, the proletarian revolutionaries and revolutionary workers of this factory, holding high the banner of "It is reasonable to revolt against the reactionaries," seized the leadership from the capitalist roaders in the great storm of the "January Revolution." Zhang Meihua is a revolutionary pioneer in this great struggle for power, elected by the revolutionary workers of the entire factory as a responsible person of the factory Revolutionary Committee. After the proletarian revolutionaries took power, they advanced rapidly along the path indicated by Chairman Mao, and the road became wider and wider.

The latest directive of the great leader Chairman Mao has made the revolutionary workers of Shanghai Machine Tool Plant, who are advancing along the path indicated by Chairman Mao, even more clear-sighted, adding boundless courage and strength. Many workers excitedly said: Chairman Mao is always close to our hearts. Chairman Mao believes in the masses the most, relies on the masses the most, and respects the revolutionary pioneering spirit of the masses the most. We have every bit of experience, and Chairman Mao is very concerned about it, using his great wisdom to summarize it and further guide the broad masses' practice. They said, Chairman Mao's latest directive has greatly boosted the morale of the proletariat and greatly dampened the spirit of the bourgeoisie. We are growing up in the great era of Mao Zedong, which is the greatest happiness!

      "Chairman Mao supports us, and we will make Chairman Mao proud!" Today, several thousand revolutionary workers of Shanghai Machine Tool Plant made this ironclad vow in front of the statue of Chairman Mao. They are full of spirit and determination, resolved to better build the proletarian engineering and technical contingent to welcome the great tide of industrial revolution.

The female lathe operator Tang Xue Mei, while enthusiastically welcoming the issuance of Chairman Mao's latest directive, once again took out the photo of Chairman Mao shaking hands with her during his inspection of Shanghai Machine Tool Plant eleven years ago from her "Quotations from Chairman Mao" book. She recalled the scene of that day with boundless happiness. That day at noon, Chairman Mao walked briskly to her lathe, kindly extending his hand to shake hands with Tang Xue Mei, whose hands were full of oil, and warmly greeted her. Today, Tang Xue Mei, using the hand that Chairman Mao shook, held up the newspaper with Chairman Mao's latest directive, excitedly saying: "Chairman Mao has affirmed the path we are taking, and we will definitely continue to walk it to the end! We workers not only strive to master higher technology but also help intellectuals quickly walk the path of integrating with workers and peasants." Tang Xue Mei's words expressed the wishes of the old workers.

A young technical engineer who graduated from university has repeatedly studied two teachings of Chairman Mao since the Cultural Revolution: "The final dividing line between revolutionary and non-revolutionary or counter-revolutionary intellectuals is whether they are willing to integrate with the workers and peasants and actually do so." "Knowledge begins with practice, and theoretical knowledge obtained through practice must return to practice." He has taken Chairman Mao's teachings as his action guideline and has achieved great results in transforming his worldview and technological research. Today, he firmly declared: I have decided to follow this path indicated by Chairman Mao! I will integrate with workers and peasants for life and be a student of workers, peasants, and soldiers for life! This young technical personnel's determination expresses the common wish of the revolutionary intellectuals of the entire factory.

      "The iron gate of the pass is like iron, but now we take the first step to cross it." At this happy moment of welcoming the issuance of Chairman Mao's latest directive, the new and old cadres of the Shanghai Machine Tool Plant Revolutionary Committee, remembering Chairman Mao's teaching "To achieve national victory, this is only the first step of the long march," resolved to take Chairman Mao's latest directive as a great driving force, "to continue to maintain the style of being modest, prudent, and free from arrogance and impetuosity," "to continue to maintain the style of hard struggle," learn from the proletarian revolutionaries across the country and the working class in the capital under the leadership of Chairman Mao and Comrade Lin, and vow to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

    坚定不移沿着毛主席指引的道路胜利前进
    ——上海机床厂革命职工热烈欢呼毛主席最新指示的发表
    伟大领袖毛主席具有伟大历史意义的最新指示：“大学还是要办的，我这里主要说的是理工科大学还要办，但学制要缩短，教育要革命，要无产阶级政治挂帅，走上海机床厂从工人中培养技术人员的道路。要从有实践经验的工人农民中间选拔学生，到学校学几年以后，又回到生产实践中去。”在昨天夜晚传到上海，黄浦江畔的这个英雄城市沸腾了！上海机床厂沸腾了！革命的工人、革命的技术人员、红卫兵革命小将和广大革命群众，欢欣鼓舞地抬着毛主席的巨幅画像和毛主席最新指示的语录牌，敲锣打鼓，从四面八方汇集到上海机床厂，向这个厂的职工报喜，向伟大领袖毛主席表达他们的无限忠诚。上海机床厂革命职工更是激动得彻夜不眠。下了班的早班工人深夜从宿舍里赶回工厂；夜班工人下班以后，继续留在厂里。他们满怀着对伟大领袖毛主席无比热爱的心情，手捧红彤彤的革命宝书《毛主席语录》，聚集在毛主席塑像前面，纵情高唱《东方红》《大海航行靠舵手》，嘹亮的歌声响彻整个工厂。厂门口，走廊上，车间里，到处都张贴出写着特大喜讯的大红喜报。一条条大标语，表达了全厂工人的心情：
      “最最热烈欢呼毛主席最新指示的发表！上海机床厂工人决不辜负毛主席的期望！”
      “毛主席最新指示说出了我们工人阶级的心里话，毛主席为我们撑腰，我们要为毛主席争气！”
    “坚决用实际行动来感谢伟大领袖毛主席对我厂的关怀！”
      “敬祝伟大领袖毛主席万寿无疆！万寿无疆！万寿无疆！”
    十一年前的七月，伟大领袖毛主席亲临上海机床厂视察，走过了一个又一个车间，亲切地和工人谈话、握手，给了上海机床厂革命职工最大的鼓舞，最大的鞭策。伟大导师毛主席的光辉形象，毛主席同群众心连心的伟大革命实践，激励着上海机床厂的革命职工，在社会主义革命和社会主义建设的战斗岁月里，沿着毛主席指引的方向奋勇前进。
    十一年以后的今天，毛主席以他最伟大的无产阶级革命家的最敏锐的观察力和最伟大的气魄，最精辟、最科学地总结了上海机床厂革命职工在毛泽东思想指引下创造的经验，发出了具有深远历史意义的最新指示。上海机床厂的革命职工，感到无比的幸福！
    全厂的战斗指挥部——厂革命委员会，在深夜和黎明两次召开扩大会议，认真学习毛主席的最新指示，衷心感谢毛主席的亲切关怀，讨论落实毛主席最新指示的具体措施。许多车间和科室举办的毛泽东思想学习班，连夜学习了毛主席的最新指示。还有许多工人聚集在扩音器下，一字一句地记下毛主席的光辉指示，反复学习、深刻领会。
    他们说，毛主席的这一伟大指示，极大地丰富和发展了马克思列宁主义。沿着毛主席指引的道路前进，就能从根本上铲除几千年来剥削阶级造成的“劳心者治人，劳力者治于人”的罪恶现象，实现劳动人民知识化，知识分子劳动化。
    他们说，毛主席这一伟大指示，是将无产阶级教育革命进行到底的战斗纲领，是各条战线进行斗、批、改，夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的行动指南，是防修反修，巩固和加强无产阶级专政，保证无产阶级江山永不变色的百年大计，千年大计，万年大计。
    他们说，遵循毛主席这一光辉指示所指明的道路奋勇前进，就能培养出无产阶级强大的知识分子队伍，培养出大批又红又专的技术人员，为进一步进行工业革命、农业革命、科学技术革命，把我国建设成为具有现代工业、现代农业、现代国防和现代科学文化的社会主义强国创造条件。我们有伟大领袖毛主席的英明领导，有伟大的毛泽东思想，有毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，再有一支无产阶级的掌握了科学技术的队伍，就能使我们伟大的社会主义祖国更加繁荣，更加强大。
    上海机床厂职工怀着无比激动的心情，回忆了自己在毛主席亲切关怀下，在毛主席无产阶级革命路线指引下的战斗历程。伟大领袖毛主席早就明确地指示我们必须有自己的技术干部队伍。毛主席的好学生柯庆施同志和上海的无产阶级革命派，坚定地遵循毛主席的教导，从工人中选拔和培养了大批工程技术人员。上海机床厂职工深切地感受到，他们从工人中培养技术人员的经验和成就，是毛主席无产阶级教育路线的伟大胜利，是毛主席无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利，是战无不胜的毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。
    上海机床厂革命职工在沿着毛主席所指引的道路胜利前进的过程中，每一步都充满着两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的惊心动魄的斗争。中国赫鲁晓夫及其在上海的代理人陈丕显、曹荻秋之流和厂内的走资派，千方百计干扰毛主席革命路线的贯彻，疯狂鼓吹“专家治厂”、“技术第一”、“白专道路”，大肆散布资产阶级名利思想和“劳心者治人，劳力者治于人”的反动谬论。工厂的无产阶级革命派在毛泽东思想指引下，和这一小撮阶级敌人进行了针锋相对的斗争。曾经多次见过伟大领袖毛主席的著名劳动模范张梅华，今天心潮澎湃，格外激动。这个在发展我国镜面磨削技术方面作出了贡献的工人，曾经受过走资派和反动技术“权威”的种种刁难和压制。他和其他工人出身的技术人员，在设计和试制我国第一台超国际先进水平的高精度半自动镜面磨削万能外圆磨床的过程中，走资派和反动技术“权威”用种种借口，不给设备，不给仪器，不让试验，并且摆出一副资产阶级老爷架子，对他冷嘲热讽，妄图阻挠工人登上科学技术舞台。张梅华和其他工人一起，从毛主席著作中吸取了伟大的精神力量，顽强不屈，坚持战斗，终于攀登了世界科学技术高峰。
    毛主席教导说：革命的根本问题是政权问题。这个厂的无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众深深懂得：过去，中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人所以能干扰毛主席革命路线的贯彻，就是因为他们窃取了一部分领导权。在毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命运动中，这个厂的无产阶级革命派和革命职工，高举“对反动派造反有理”的大旗，在伟大的“一月革命”风暴中，从走资派手里夺回了领导权。张梅华就是这个伟大夺权斗争中的革命闯将，被全厂革命职工推选为厂革命委员会负责人。这个厂的无产阶级革命派掌权后，在毛主席指引的道路上疾步前进，路子越走越宽。
    伟大领袖毛主席的最新指示，使正沿着毛主席指引的道路阔步前进的上海机床厂革命职工更加心明眼亮，增加了无穷的勇气和力量。许多工人激动地说：毛主席永远同我们工人心连心。毛主席最相信群众，最依靠群众，最尊重群众的革命首创精神，我们有一点一滴的经验，毛主席都非常关心，用伟大的智慧把它总结起来，又进一步指导广大群众的实践。他们说，毛主席的最新指示，大长了无产阶级的志气，大灭了资产阶级的威风。我们生长在伟大的毛泽东时代，是最大的幸福！
      “毛主席为我们撑腰，我们为毛主席争气！”今天，上海机床厂数千名革命职工在毛主席塑像面前立下了这一钢铁誓言。他们意气风发，斗志昂扬，决心更好地建设无产阶级工程技术队伍，来迎接伟大的工业革命高潮。
    磨床女工唐雪妹在热烈欢呼毛主席最新指示发表的时候，又一次从《毛主席语录》本里拿出了十一年前毛主席视察上海机床厂时同她亲切握手的照片。她怀着无限幸福的心情回忆了当年的情景。那一天中午，毛主席健步走到她的机床旁边，慈祥地伸出手来，握住唐雪妹满是油泥的手，亲切地向她问候。今天，唐雪妹用毛主席握过的手，捧着登载着毛主席最新指示的报纸，激动地说：“毛主席肯定了我们走的道路，我们就是要坚定不移地走下去，走到底！我们工人不仅要努力掌握更高的技术，还要帮助知识分子更快地走上与工农结合的道路。”唐雪妹的话，说出了老工人们的心愿。
    一个大学毕业的青年技术员，文化大革命以来，反复学习了毛主席两段教导：“革命的或不革命的或反革命的知识分子的最后的分界，看其是否愿意并且实行和工农民众相结合。”“认识从实践始，经过实践得到了理论的认识，还须再回到实践去。”他以毛主席的教导作为自己行动的准则，在改造世界观和技术研究方面，都取得了很大的成绩。今天，他坚定地表示：毛主席指引的这条道路，我走定了！我要一辈子与工农相结合，一辈子做工农兵的小学生！这个青年技术人员的决心，表达了全厂革命知识分子的共同心愿。
      “雄关漫道真如铁，而今迈步从头越。”在欢呼毛主席最新指示发表的幸福时刻，上海机床厂革命委员会的新老干部，牢记毛主席“夺取全国胜利，这只是万里长征走完了第一步”的教导，决心以毛主席最新指示为巨大动力，“继续地保持谦虚、谨慎、不骄、不躁的作风”，“继续地保持艰苦奋斗的作风”，向全国、全市的无产阶级革命派学习，向毛主席和林副主席身边的首都工人阶级学习，誓夺无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利！  新华社记者
