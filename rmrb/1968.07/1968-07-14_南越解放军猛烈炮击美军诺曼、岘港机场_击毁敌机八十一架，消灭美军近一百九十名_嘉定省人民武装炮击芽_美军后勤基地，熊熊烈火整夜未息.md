The South Vietnamese Liberation Army's artillery units in the northern part of Quang Nam Province launched heavy artillery strikes on the U.S. military airfields at Norman and Da Nang on the nights of June 26 and June 28, destroying a total of 81 enemy aircraft and killing nearly 190 U.S. troops.

The report said that on the night of June 26, the Liberation Army's artillery units launched a fierce barrage on the Norman airfield, with shells hitting the apron and barracks directly, immediately destroying 32 aircraft, demolishing two rows of barracks, and killing 94 U.S. troops.

On the night of June 28, the Liberation Army's artillery units struck the Norman airfield again, destroying another 20 aircraft and setting a fuel depot on fire. On the same night, the Liberation Army's artillery units also struck the Da Nang airfield, destroying 29 aircraft and killing or wounding 95 U.S. troops, most of whom were American pilots and technical personnel.

Preliminary statistics show that since the beginning of this year, the military and people of northern Quang Nam Province have launched a total of 12 attacks on these two airfields, destroying or damaging 234 aircraft (excluding the results of May's battles), and killing hundreds of U.S. troops.

Another report said that from June 24 to June 29, the armed self-defense forces in Da Nang City and its suburbs in northern Quang Nam Province launched five consecutive attacks, destroying four enemy military vehicles in the city and suburbs, killing 76 U.S. and puppet troops, and seizing a batch of weapons, ammunition, and military supplies.

The South Vietnamese Liberation Army's artillery units in Gia Dinh Province launched a heavy artillery strike on the U.S. military logistics base in Nha Be on the night of July 8. Preliminary reports indicate that the accurate artillery fire of the Liberation Army's forces set three oil depots, a chemical raw material warehouse, and a power plant on fire. The fire burned throughout the night.
