The revolutionary model opera *The Red Lantern*, personally cultivated by Comrade Jiang Qing, was performed again. We railway workers are extremely delighted. Revolutionary model operas are the shining pearls in the treasury of proletarian literature and art. Their appearance has opened a brilliant new chapter in the history of human literature and art. We all love to watch revolutionary model operas! We have a particularly deep affection for *The Red Lantern*. Watching it makes us feel especially close to it.

We say it feels close because *The Red Lantern* truly reflects the history of our railway workers' revolutionary struggle. It speaks the words that are in our hearts.

We say it feels close because the heroic figures in *The Red Lantern*, such as Li Yuhe, Li Tie Mei, and Grandma Li, are all vivid and seem to be among us. They are truly the representatives of us railway workers.

We also say it feels close because the title *The Red Lantern* is well-chosen. We railway workers are very familiar with the red lantern. It is like our eyes, watching over the railway lines day and night to ensure the safe operation of trains. Its bright red light is like our railway workers' red heart for the great leader Chairman Mao and for the cause of the proletarian revolution.

The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us that literature and art should become a powerful weapon for "uniting the people, educating the people, attacking the enemy, and annihilating the enemy." *The Red Lantern* is a model play that fully demonstrates the fighting role of revolutionary literature and art. Many workers in our locomotive depot have said: *The Red Lantern* is a revolutionary struggle history of our working class; it is our textbook for recalling bitterness and sweetness and for conducting class education. It sets a good example for us to learn from and inspires us to march forward forever!

The most profound lesson this play teaches us is the glorious image of Li Yuhe. He is a hero filled with revolutionary heroism, standing tall and firm. Look, when he was captured, Grandma Li had Li Tie Mei bring him a bowl of wine to see him off, encouraging him to bravely face the severe test that lay ahead. Li Yuhe took the wine and drank it down in one gulp, his eyes flashing with contempt and hatred for the enemy. The lines "His body is full of courage, brave and gallant" and "He can handle a thousand cups and ten thousand cups" fully express Li Yuhe's iron will and fearlessness in the face of danger. The scene *Fighting at the Banquet on Eagle Mountain* is truly satisfying to watch. The traitor Eagle Mountain tried to extract the secret code from Li Yuhe through bribery and threats, even using his reactionary "philosophy of life" to try to shake Li Yuhe's firm belief in communism. Li Yuhe remained calm and resolute throughout, fighting back decisively, making Eagle Mountain look foolish and pathetic, until he finally resorted to his vicious trick: torture. But after the torture, the figure standing before Eagle Mountain was still that of Li Yuhe, a heroic figure like a golden warrior in the flames. In the scene *Struggle at the Execution Ground*, Eagle Mountain tried again to use so-called human emotions to move Li Yuhe and Grandma Li to hand over the secret code. But this revolutionary family of three generations, as they were about to part, thought not of their own lives and deaths, but of the entire proletarian revolutionary cause. They encouraged each other, showing their lofty revolutionary character. At this critical moment, Li Yuhe thought not of himself or his family, but of the "revolutionary red flag being raised high, the flames of resistance burning across the land," and of "New China, like the morning sun, shining upon the world." His broad and open communist heart and noble revolutionary spirit have greatly inspired and educated us.

Li Yuhe is a revolutionary fighter armed with Mao Zedong Thought. When our old workers talk about *The Red Lantern*, they affectionately call Li Yuhe "a good comrade from those days," and the young workers praise Li Yuhe as a good predecessor. We all express our determination to learn from Li Yuhe and strive to be Li Yuhe-like railway workers. In the face of the enemy, we must, like Li Yuhe, display revolutionary heroism, overcome all enemies, and rather stand and die than kneel and live; on the revolutionary path, when we encounter difficulties and dangers, we must not retreat, but like the Li family, "advance forward, one after another!"

The Chinese Khrushchev vigorously peddles the "traitor philosophy" and "survival philosophy," saying that surrendering to the enemy is "for the sake of the party's interests" and "for the sake of accumulating revolutionary forces," which is truly despicable! Li Yuhe's heroic deeds have given the great traitor, the Chinese Khrushchev, a resounding slap in the face.

Watching *The Red Lantern* has further stirred up our hatred for the old society and our love for the new society. Every time we listen to the scene *Recalling the Family History of Revolution*, we can't help but shed tears. The ordeals of Grandma Li's family in the old society are a microcosm of the experiences of all railway workers. It was Chairman Mao and the Communist Party who led us to stand up and gain liberation, making us the masters of the state. The people's country is what the revolutionary martyrs have paid for with their lives and blood, and it is not easily won. We must defend it with our lives. We must always remember the bitterness of class struggle, never forget the blood debt, and always remember Chairman Mao's teaching: "Never forget class struggle." We must thoroughly criticize the Chinese Khrushchev's theory of "the extinction of class struggle" and eliminate its poison.

For a long time, with the support and protection of the Chinese Khrushchev, the stage of literature and art has been monopolized by the bourgeoisie. They have done everything possible to promote the big, foreign, and old, singing the praises of feudalism, capitalism, and revisionism, and using literature and art to create public opinion for the restoration of capitalism in a mad and heartless way. Under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, Comrade Jiang Qing led revolutionary literary and art warriors to brave the black wind and resist the evil waves, creating *The Red Lantern* and other eight model operas. They smashed the revisionist black line in literature and art, stopped the Chinese Khrushchev's attempt to drive towards capitalism, and turned the history that had been turned upside down back to its rightful place, making workers, peasants, and soldiers the masters of the literary and artistic stage. This is a great victory of Mao Zedong Thought, and we shout and sing a thousand times, ten thousand times in celebration of this great victory!

*The Red Lantern* has set a good example for us to learn from. We, the revolutionary faction of the proletariat, are determined to always read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, and be good soldiers of Chairman Mao. Like Li Yuhe and Li Tie Mei, we will take the revolutionary red lantern from our predecessors and hold it high, marching forward forever!

    高举红灯永向前
    北京铁路局丰台机务段工人　陈福汗　杜　真　张万和　赵家福
　尹振声　曹春荣
    由江青同志亲自培育的京剧革命样板戏《红灯记》再次公演，我们铁路工人高兴极了。革命样板戏，是无产阶级文艺宝库中的明珠。它的出现，在人类文艺史上揭开了光辉灿烂的新篇章。我们大伙儿可爱看革命样板戏啦！对《红灯记》感情特别深，看了觉得格外亲。
    说它亲，是因为《红灯记》真实地反映了我们铁路工人革命斗争的历史，说的是我们心里要说的话。
    说它亲，是因为《红灯记》里的李玉和、李铁梅和李奶奶等英雄人物形象，都是活生生的，就好象在我们中间一样。他们真正是我们铁路工人的代表。
    说它亲，还因为《红灯记》这个戏名起得好。我们铁路工人对红灯都非常熟悉，它好象我们铁路工人的眼睛，日日夜夜注视着铁路线，保障列车运转的安全。它那红艳艳的光焰，就好象我们铁路工人对伟大领袖毛主席、对无产阶级革命事业的一颗红心。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们，要使文艺成为“团结人民、教育人民、打击敌人、消灭敌人”的有力武器。《红灯记》就是一出充分发挥革命文艺战斗作用的好戏。我们机务段的许多工人反映说：《红灯记》是我们工人阶级的一部革命斗争史；是我们工人忆苦思甜、进行阶级教育的教科书。它为我们树立了学习的好榜样，鼓舞我们永远向前进！
    这出戏，对我们教育最深的是李玉和的光辉形象。他是一个浑身充满革命英雄主义精神、顶天立地的英雄人物。你看，当他被捕时，李奶奶让铁梅端来一碗酒为他送行，鼓励他英勇地迎接即将面临的一场严重的考验。李玉和把酒接过来，猛地喝了下去，眼睛里射出一股蔑视敌人、仇恨敌人的怒火。“浑身是胆雄赳赳”和“千杯万盏会应酬”这两句唱词，充分表现出李玉和的钢铁意志和临危不惧的英雄气概。《赴宴斗鸠山》这场戏，看了真使人解气。贼鸠山为了想从李玉和手里拿到密电码，对李玉和利诱、威胁，甚至搬出他的反动的“人生哲学”，妄想动摇李玉和对共产主义的坚定信仰。李玉和从头至尾，从容不迫，坚决斗争，使得鸠山丑态百出，狼狈不堪，最后只好使出狠毒的一招：严刑拷打。但是用刑之后，挺立在鸠山面前的，仍然是李玉和这个烈火金刚似的高大的英雄形象。在《刑场斗争》这场戏里，鸠山又妄想使用所谓人情来打动李玉和和李奶奶，使他们交出密电码。但是这革命的祖孙三代在就要诀别的时候，想到的不是个人的生死，而是整个无产阶级的革命事业。他们互相鼓励，表现了崇高的革命品德。李玉和在这生死关头，所想到的、看到的不是自己和自己一家，而是看到“革命的红旗高举起，抗日的烽火已燎原”，想到“新中国，似朝阳，光照人间。”他那宽阔坦荡的共产主义胸怀和高尚的革命气节，使我们受到了极大的鼓舞和教育。
    李玉和是用毛泽东思想武装起来的革命战士。我们老工人谈起《红灯记》来，都亲热地称李玉和是“当年的好弟兄”，青年工人称赞李玉和是好先辈。我们大家都表示要学习李玉和，争当李玉和式的铁路工人。在敌人面前，要象李玉和那样发扬革命的英雄主义，要压倒一切敌人，宁肯站着死，不愿跪着生；在革命的道路上遇到了困难、艰险，决不退缩，要象李玉和一家那样，“前仆后继走向前！”
    中国赫鲁晓夫极力贩卖“叛徒哲学”“活命哲学”，胡说什么：在敌人面前自首变节，是“为了维护党的利益”、“为了积蓄革命力量”，真是卑鄙无耻！李玉和的英雄行为，给了大工贼、大叛徒中国赫鲁晓夫一记响亮的耳光。
    看了《红灯记》，更加激起我们对旧社会的恨和对新社会的爱。我们每回听《痛说革命家史》这场戏，都忍不住要掉眼泪。旧社会李奶奶一家的遭遇，正是我们所有铁路工人遭遇的缩影。是毛主席、共产党领导我们翻身得解放，做了国家的主人。人民的江山，是革命先烈们用生命和鲜血换来的，得来不容易，我们要誓死保卫她。我们要永远牢记阶级苦，不忘血泪仇。我们要牢牢记住毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的教导，要彻底批判中国赫鲁晓夫散布的“阶级斗争熄灭”论，肃清它的流毒。
    长时期以来，由于中国赫鲁晓夫的支持和包庇，文艺舞台一直被资产阶级把持着。他们千方百计地吹捧大、洋、古，歌颂封、资、修，丧心病狂地利用文艺为复辟资本主义制造舆论。在毛泽东思想指引下，江青同志带领革命文艺战士顶黑风，抗恶浪，创作出《红灯记》等八个样板戏，摧垮了修正主义文艺黑线，刹住了中国赫鲁晓夫妄想开往资本主义的破车，把被颠倒的历史，再颠倒过来，使工农兵成为文艺舞台的主人。这是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，我们千遍欢呼、万遍歌唱这一伟大胜利！
    《红灯记》给我们树立了学习的好榜样。我们无产阶级革命派决心永远读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，做毛主席的好战士。象李玉和和李铁梅那样，从先辈手里接过革命红灯，高举红灯永向前！
