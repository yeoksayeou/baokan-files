	“What the foreigners have, we must have; what the foreigners don’t have, we must also have”
	Synthetic diamond trial production successful and put into production

	The workers of the relevant research institutions and factories of the First Ministry of Machinery, who are responsible for this trial production task, use Chairman Mao's "On Practice," "On Contradiction," and other brilliant works as weapons, and carry forward the revolutionary spirit of daring to think, dare to speak, dare to do, and dare to venture, and the trial production has been successful.

	According to a Xinhua News Agency report on the 21st, the workers of the relevant research institutions and factories of the First Ministry of Machinery, under the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, with the strong support and assistance of many factories and scientific research institutions across the country, broke through the foreign framework, relied on their own efforts, successfully trial-produced synthetic diamonds, and put them into production.

	Synthetic diamond is a new product that has emerged in the international arena in recent years. The production of this product has high technical requirements for equipment. Its performance is the same as that of natural diamonds and is an indispensable thing for the development of modern industry. With the rapid development of China's socialist construction, many departments are increasingly in urgent need of diamonds. The relevant research institutions of the First Ministry of Machinery accepted the trial production task. Some people once thought that only a few countries in the world could produce synthetic diamonds and did not believe that China's technical equipment and technical strength could produce synthetic diamonds. The revolutionary workers responsible for this trial production task, under the brilliant illumination of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, through the active study and application of Chairman Mao's works, broke through superstition, liberated their minds. They loudly put forward: "What the foreigners have, we must have; what the foreigners don’t have, we must also have. As long as we arm our minds with Mao Zedong Thought, we can overcome any difficulty, and synthetic diamonds must be manufactured!"

	The revolutionary workers responsible for this trial production task, in the absence of technical data, experience, and equipment, repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's brilliant work "On Practice," and followed the great leader Chairman Mao's teachings of "knowledge begins with practice" and "all true knowledge originates from direct experience." They carried forward the revolutionary spirit of daring to think, dare to speak, dare to do, and dare to venture, and finally overcame the technical difficulties and successfully trial-produced synthetic diamonds that meet the quality requirements.

	In order to quickly put synthetic diamonds into production, they jointly researched and designed a new type of equipment with relevant units. In the trial production process, revolutionary workers and technical personnel used Chairman Mao's "Old Three Articles" and "On Practice," "On Contradiction," and other brilliant works as weapons. When they encountered difficulties, they consulted Chairman Mao's works. They carried out in-depth revolutionary criticism and criticism, severely criticized the counter-revolutionary revisionist line that China's Khrushchev promoted in scientific research, further improved proletarian awareness and awareness of the two-line struggle. They pooled their wisdom and, after many trials, finally successfully trial-produced this equipment, enabling synthetic diamonds to be smoothly put into production.

    “国外有的，我们要有；国外没有的，我们也要有”
    人造金刚石试制成功并投入生产
    担负这项试制工作的一机部有关研究单位和工厂的革命职工，以毛主席的《实践论》、《矛盾论》等光辉著作为武器，发扬敢想、敢说、敢干、敢闯的革命精神，试制获得成功
    据新华社二十一日讯 第一机械工业部有关研究单位和工厂的革命职工，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在全国许多工厂和科学研究单位的大力支援和协助下，打破洋框框，自力更生，试制成功人造金刚石，并投入了生产。
    人造金刚石是国际上近年来发展起来的新产品，生产这种产品对技术设备要求很高。它的性能与天然金刚石一样，是现代工业发展不可缺少的东西。随着我国社会主义建设事业的迅速发展，许多部门越来越迫切需要金刚石。一机部有关研究单位接受了试制任务。有人曾认为，世界上只有少数国家才能生产人造金刚石，不相信我国的技术设备和技术力量能够生产人造金刚石。负责这项试制工作的革命职工在战无不胜的毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，通过活学活用毛主席著作，破除了迷信，解放了思想。他们响亮地提出：“国外有的，我们要有；国外没有的，我们也要有。只要我们用毛泽东思想武装头脑，什么困难都可以克服，人造金刚石一定能够制造出来！”
    担负这项试制工作的革命职工，在缺少技术资料、缺少经验和设备的情况下，反复学习了毛主席的光辉著作《实践论》，遵照伟大领袖毛主席关于“认识从实践始”，
  “一切真知都是从直接经验发源的”的教导，发扬敢想、敢说、敢干、敢闯的革命精神，终于攻克了技术难关，试制成功质量合乎要求的人造金刚石。
    为了使人造金刚石迅速投入生产，他们又同有关单位共同研究设计了一种新型的设备。在试制过程中，革命职工和技术人员以毛主席的“老三篇”和《实践论》、《矛盾论》等光辉著作为武器，遇到困难就向毛主席著作请教。他们深入地开展革命的大批判，狠批了中国赫鲁晓夫在科学研究方面推行的反革命修正主义路线，进一步提高了无产阶级觉悟和两条路线斗争觉悟。他们群策群力，经过许多次的试验，终于将这种设备试制成功，使人造金刚石顺利地投入了生产。
