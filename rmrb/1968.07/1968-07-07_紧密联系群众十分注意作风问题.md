The People's Daily, Red Flag Magazine, and the Liberation Army Daily published the important editorial "Carry Forward the Party's Tradition of Maintaining Close Ties with the Masses," conveying the voice of the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin. This call to continue upholding and carrying forward the Party's fine tradition of maintaining close ties with the masses is of great significance. We must seriously study this important editorial and pay close attention to the issue of work style.

Maintaining close ties with the masses is the fundamental starting point of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Chairman Mao's revolutionary line is the most thorough mass line, completely believing in and relying on the masses, and resolutely protecting the masses. Only by maintaining close ties with the masses and forever keeping a blood-and-flesh connection with them can we deeply understand the masses' revolutionary demands, keep pace with the masses' forward march, fully mobilize the masses' revolutionary enthusiasm, and more consciously implement Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. This will ensure that the battle tasks, line, principles, and policies of the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin are fully carried out among the masses.

Our great leader Chairman Mao always emphasizes the importance of work style at crucial historical moments when great victories are won. This is an important guarantee for uniting the entire Party and the revolutionary masses, overcoming difficulties, defeating the enemy, consolidating victories, and developing victories. It is an important guarantee for ensuring that our revolutionary power never changes color and that revolutionary power is always in the hands of the proletarian revolutionaries. For proletarian revolutionaries, maintaining close ties with the masses is a matter of principle. In our Party's history and during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, some people made mistakes partly because they neglected this issue of work style, moving from not believing in the masses to alienating themselves from the masses and suppressing the masses, ultimately being abandoned by the masses. We must learn from these lessons.

Members of the revolutionary committees, whether they are old cadres or new cadres who emerged during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, must all carry forward the Party's tradition of maintaining close ties with the masses. Some new cadres think that since they themselves come from the masses and represent the revolutionary masses, this issue does not concern them. This sense of superiority must be overcome. Revolutionary new cadres coming from the masses is a favorable condition for maintaining close ties with the masses. But this favorable condition is not a "guarantee" that you will never alienate yourself from the masses. We must always remember Chairman Mao's teaching: "We should call on the whole Party to be on the alert and pay attention to every comrade at every work link to prevent them from alienating themselves from the masses." Any sense of superiority or "exceptionalism" must be completely discarded.

    紧密联系群众十分注意作风问题
    《人民日报》、《红旗》杂志、《解放军报》发表了《发扬党的紧密联系群众的作风》的重要社论，传达了以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的声音，号召我们继续保持和发扬党的紧密联系群众的优良作风，具有非常重大的意义。我们必须认真学习这篇重要社论，十分注意作风问题。
    紧密联系群众，是毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的基本出发点。毛主席的革命路线，是最彻底的群众路线，是完全相信和依靠群众，坚决保护群众的路线。只有紧密联系群众，永远和群众保持血肉相连的关系，才能深刻了解群众的革命要求，跟上群众的前进步伐，充分调动群众的革命积极性，才能更自觉地贯彻执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，把以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的战斗任务、路线、方针和政策，全面地落实到群众中去。
    我们的伟大领袖毛主席每当夺取伟大胜利的历史关头，在提出革命任务、路线、方针和政策的同时，总是号召我们十分注意作风问题。这是团结全党和广大革命群众，克服困难，战胜敌人，巩固胜利，发展胜利的重要保证。这是使我们的革命政权永不变色的重要保证，是使革命政权永远掌握在无产阶级革命派手里的重要保证。紧密联系群众，对于无产阶级革命派来说，是革命的大节。在我党历史上，在无产阶级文化大革命中，有些人之所以犯错误，一方面的原因，就是由于忽视这个作风问题，从不相信群众到脱离群众、镇压群众，最终为群众所抛弃。我们必须引以为戒。
    革命委员会的成员，不论是革命的老干部，还是在无产阶级文化大革命运动中涌现出来的新干部，都要发扬党的紧密联系群众的作风。有的新干部认为自己本身就是从群众中来的，是革命群众的代表，因此不存在这个问题。这种优越感必须打掉。革命的新干部来自群众，这是紧密联系群众的有利条件。但这个有利条件，绝不是保证你永不脱离群众的“保险箱”。我们必须牢牢记住毛主席“应该号召全党提起警觉，注意每一个工作环节上的每一个同志，不要让他脱离群众”的教导，任何优越感、“例外”论都应当统统收起来。　　　《文汇报》七月二日社论
