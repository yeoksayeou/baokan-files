The U.S. imperialists, while intensifying their political control, economic plunder, and cultural infiltration of Brazil, are colluding with the Brazilian reactionaries to carry out a genocide against the indigenous people of Brazil. This once again exposes the U.S. imperialists as the most ferocious and brutal enemy of the oppressed peoples and nations of the world.

The indigenous people of Brazil are the original inhabitants of Brazil with a long history, and they were the first to develop the land and natural resources of Brazil. According to Brazilian sources, the number of indigenous people in Brazil once reached about ten million. During the Portuguese colonial rule, they were slaughtered and persecuted by the colonists. The survivors were forced to move to remote and vast forest areas, especially the undeveloped Amazon basin. After the U.S. imperialists replaced the Portuguese colonists in invading Brazil, in order to plunder and occupy the land and natural resources of Brazil without restraint, they closely colluded with the Brazilian reactionaries to continue the brutal massacre of the indigenous people. In recent years, in order to seize the land in the Amazon basin, grab strategic resources, and establish a strategic base aimed at suppressing the national democratic movements of the Latin American countries, the U.S. imperialists have intensified their massacre of the indigenous people, developing it into a planned, large-scale genocide. According to recent revelations by the *Diário de Notícias*, under this barbaric massacre, the indigenous people of Brazil now number only in the tens of thousands.

The massacre of the indigenous people is carried out by the U.S. imperialists in collusion with the Brazilian reactionaries using extremely treacherous and cruel methods. According to Brazilian newspapers, American neocolonialists in the northern Brazilian state of Pará use automatic weapons to attack local indigenous residents, burn their homes, and seize their land. The Machacalis tribe in Minas Gerais state was attacked by "gun squads." In Mato Grosso state, the U.S. imperialists also colluded with local large landowners and the bourgeoisie, using military aircraft to bomb the Xingu tribe. American neocolonialists, under the guise of the "Peace Corps," "religious missions," and other new pretexts, use various vicious methods to assassinate indigenous people. They organize "expeditions" to lure the Beso de Pago people to eat food laced with arsenic, ant poison, and other poisons, killing the entire tribe. The Pataksu people in Bahia state were injected with smallpox, measles, and typhoid viruses, causing the entire tribe to fall ill and die.

In the vast and resource-rich states of Amazonas and Mato Grosso, the crimes of massacring indigenous people are rampant. In recent years, the U.S. imperialists have intensified their actions to "internationalize" the Amazon basin, which covers 42% of Brazil's territory, establishing secret military bases and setting up so-called "jungle warfare training centers," attempting to use this region as a base to suppress the national democratic movements of Latin American countries and as an important source of strategic materials for plunder.

Great leader Chairman Mao pointed out: "National struggles, in the final analysis, are a class struggle." The national oppression suffered by the indigenous people of Brazil once again proves the correctness of Chairman Mao's assertion. A large amount of evidence shows that the large-scale massacre of the indigenous people of Brazil is part of the class oppression by the U.S. imperialists in collusion with the Brazilian reactionaries to plunder and exploit the Brazilian working people. According to reports, after the large-scale massacre of indigenous people was exposed, Brazilian Justice Minister Gama Silva was forced to admit that the massacre of indigenous people is closely related to the seizure and occupation of Brazilian land by foreign large landowners and monopolists, mainly from the United States.

According to obviously reduced figures revealed by Brazilian officials, American large landowners and monopolists have already seized 16 million hectares of land in Brazil, of which 3.2 million hectares originally belonged to the indigenous people. Brazil once had an official organization called the "Indigenous Protection Service," mainly composed of reactionary officers representing the interests of U.S. imperialism and Brazilian large landowners and comprador bourgeoisie. This organization itself is a tool used by U.S. imperialism and Brazilian reactionary forces to persecute and massacre indigenous people.

Facing the butcher knives of U.S. imperialism and the Brazilian reactionaries, the indigenous people of Brazil have put up a heroic resistance. Last June, in the Amazon basin, the deeply aggrieved indigenous people once attacked an air force base with poisoned arrows, striking back at the brutal oppressors, the U.S.-Brazilian reactionaries.

    美帝在巴西野蛮屠杀印第安人
    勾结巴西反动派使用各种狠毒手段进行种族灭绝的罪恶活动
    新华社讯　里约热内卢消息：美帝国主义在加紧对巴西进行政治控制、经济掠夺和文化渗透的同时，正在勾结巴西反动派，对巴西土著居民印第安人实行种族灭绝的大屠杀。这再次暴露了美帝国主义是世界被压迫人民和被压迫民族的最凶恶、最残暴的敌人。
    巴西印第安人是巴西历史悠久的土著居民，是巴西土地和自然富源最早的开拓者。据巴西有关资料，巴西印第安人的人数最早曾经有一千万左右。在葡萄牙殖民统治时期，他们遭到殖民者的杀戮、迫害。幸存者被迫移居边远辽阔的林莽地区，特别是未经开发的亚马逊流域。美帝国主义取代葡萄牙殖民者侵入巴西以后，为了肆无忌惮地掠夺和侵占巴西的土地和自然资源，紧密勾结巴西反动派，继续对印第安人实行残酷的屠杀。近年来，美帝国主义为了侵占在亚马逊流域的土地、攫取战略资源和建立目的在于镇压拉丁美洲各国民族民主运动的战略基地，对印第安人的屠杀更加变本加厉，竟发展成有计划、大规模的种族灭绝活动。据《巴西日报》最近透露，在这种野蛮的屠杀下，巴西土著印第安人目前只剩下几万人。
    对印第安人的屠杀，是美帝国主义伙同巴西反动派，用极其阴险、残酷的手段进行的。据巴西报纸揭露，美国新殖民主义者在巴西北部巴拉州使用自动武器袭击当地土著居民，烧毁他们的房舍，侵占他们的土地。米纳斯吉拉斯州的马沙卡利部落遭到“手枪队”的进攻。在马托格罗索州，美帝国主义还勾结当地的大庄园主和大资产阶级，动用军用飞机，大肆轰炸辛塔拉尔加部落。美国新殖民主义者还在“和平队”、“宗教使团”等等新的名目下，使用各种恶毒手段，暗杀印第安人。他们组织“远征队”，去诱骗贝索德包人吃掺有砒霜、灭蚁药等毒品的食物，把这个部落的人毒死。巴伊亚州的帕塔克苏人竟被注射天花、斑疹、伤寒等病毒，使这个部落的人发病死亡。
    在土地辽阔、资源丰富的亚马逊州和马托格罗索州，屠杀印第安人的罪行最为猖獗。美帝国主义近年来加紧采取行动，在占巴西领土百分之四十二的亚马逊流域实行所谓“国际化”，设立秘密军事基地，开办所谓“丛林战训练中心”，企图把这个地区作为它镇压拉丁美洲各国民族民主运动的基地和掠夺战略物资的重要来源。
    伟大导师毛主席指出：“民族斗争，说到底，是一个阶级斗争问题。”巴西印第安人所遭受的民族迫害再次证明了毛主席这一论断的英明正确。大量事实证明，对巴西印第安人的大规模屠杀，正是美帝国主义勾结巴西反动派掠夺、压榨巴西劳动人民的阶级压迫的一部分。据报道，在大规模屠杀印第安人事件被公开揭露以后，巴西司法部长加马·席尔瓦也被迫承认，屠杀印第安人事件，同主要来自美国的外国大庄园主和垄断资本家抢购、霸占巴西土地有着“密切的相互关系”。
    据巴西官方人士透露的显然是缩小了的数字，美国大庄园主和垄断资本已经在巴西占有一千六百万公顷土地，其中三百二十万公顷原来属于印第安人。巴西曾有一个所谓“印第安人保护署”的官方机构，主要由代表美帝国主义和巴西大庄园主、买办资产阶级利益的反动军官组成，这个机构本身就是美帝国主义和巴西反动势力迫害、屠杀印第安人的工具。
    在美帝国主义和巴西反动派的屠刀面前，巴西印第安人进行了英勇的反抗。去年六月，在亚马逊流域，苦大仇深的印第安人曾经手持毒箭，奋起袭击了一个空军基地，打击了残酷迫害他们的美巴反动派。
