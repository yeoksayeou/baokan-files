The mountain village of Jianchangpu Production Brigade in Shancizhuang Commune, Benxi County, Liaoning Province, has undergone a tremendous transformation in the past two years of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. People and land have changed, and the changes have been earth-shaking. This transformation fully demonstrates the profound significance of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the boundless power of Mao Zedong Thought and Mao Zedong's revolutionary line.

The Radiant Light of Mao Zedong Thought
Illuminates the Hearts of Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants

Jianchangpu was once a notorious backward brigade in Benxi County, relying on state subsidies for grain and financial aid. People called it "Reduction Brigade." Some members even composed a rhyme: "Jianchangpu is a poor mountain nest, barren hills and bad water, thin soil, every step on stones, farming on slopes all year, laboring hard for little return." When the poor and lower-middle peasants received the state-subsidized grain and financial aid, they all felt they had let Chairman Mao down and were eager to shed the label of backwardness.

Why did Jianchangpu become "Reduction Brigade"? For years, people often looked for the reasons, but after much searching, some thought it was as the rhyme said: thin soil and poor quality. However, others disagreed, saying, "Dazhai's soil is even thinner than ours, why do they increase production every year?" So, what was the real reason?

The radiant light of Mao Zedong Thought illuminated the hearts of the poor and lower-middle peasants. During the tumultuous Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the People's Liberation Army Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team enthusiastically propagated Mao Zedong Thought to the poor and lower-middle peasants of Jianchangpu and studied Chairman Mao's great teachings on class and class struggle with them. Great Mao Zedong Thought helped the poor and lower-middle peasants see the root cause of Jianchangpu's past backwardness. Jianchangpu became "Reduction Brigade" because a handful of capitalist-roaders within the party faithfully executed the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of Liu Shaoqi, crazily advocating "three freedoms and one contract," attempting to restore capitalism; because a handful of capitalist-roaders within the party and untransformed landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists colluded to attack and frame the poor and lower-middle peasants, suppressing their enthusiasm for building socialism; because a handful of capitalist-roaders within the party vigorously obstructed the broad poor and lower-middle peasants from studying Chairman Mao's works, attempting to make them stray from the path guided by Chairman Mao.

Under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, after the poor and lower-middle peasants found the root cause of Jianchangpu's backwardness, they raised high the banner of "It is reasonable to rebel against reactionaries" and launched a massive exposure, criticism, and struggle against Liu Shaoqi and his agents.

The broad poor and lower-middle peasants said, the more Liu Shaoqi and his agents opposed our studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, the more we must put studying and applying Chairman Mao's works at the forefront of all work. Through recalling bitterness and tasting sweetness, they loved and were loyal to the great leader Chairman Mao even more, and studied and applied great Mao Zedong Thought more consciously. Now, in Jianchangpu, every poor and lower-middle peasant family hangs a portrait of Chairman Mao, every household has Chairman Mao's quotations covering the walls, and everyone studies the "Three Articles." Seventy-four-year-old poor peasant Fu Laomama leads her grandson to salute Chairman Mao's portrait every day, wishing Chairman Mao eternal life and singing "The East Is Red." Someone said, "Grandma, you have few teeth left, your singing is off-key." She replied, "Even if the tune is off, the sentiment is deep, singing is the heart of the poor and lower-middle peasants." Poor peasant member Wu Xiuchun called her twelve-year-old son who was studying to teach her the "Three Articles." The son taught, and the mother learned, the more she learned, the brighter she felt, the more she wanted to learn. At night, lying on the kang, she still insisted on studying a quotation from Chairman Mao with the whole family. She said, "Chairman Mao's books are guiding lights, we poor and lower-middle peasants must read Chairman Mao's books to make revolution."

With the help of the People's Liberation Army Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team, the poor and lower-middle peasants of Jianchangpu, following Chairman Mao's great teaching of "holding study classes is a good method, many problems can be solved in study classes," established permanent Mao Zedong Thought study classes in the brigade, and every household also established Mao Zedong Thought study classes. Since the establishment of the study classes, the broad poor and lower-middle peasants, from those in their seventies and eighties to children of seven or eight, all studied and applied Chairman Mao's works more eagerly. They said, "Three meals a day, study Chairman Mao's quotations three times, don't eat if you don't study. Study before sleeping, don't sleep if you don't study." Everyone took Chairman Mao's quotations to the fields, studied a bit before and during work. They said, "Hang Chairman Mao's quotations at the field, the red sun illuminates our hearts, one quotation is a thousand jin of strength, people change, spirits rise, and production increases." Young team member Sun Jingwen, who drives a cart every night, insisted on studying Chairman Mao's works before setting out. He said, "Mao Zedong Thought is a treasure, drivers cannot do without it, if you don't read Chairman Mao's books for a day, the cart will go astray!" Over sixty-year-old poor peasant old woman Li Suqin, whenever there was a lecture on studying Chairman Mao's works, she attended every session. She lived in a valley four li away from the brigade, to get to the brigade she had to cross a mountain and a river. In winter, with heavy snow and cold wind, the small wooden bridge was slippery with ice and snow. She climbed over the bridge for the sake of studying Chairman Mao's works. She said, no matter how great the difficulty, it could be overcome for the sake of studying Chairman Mao's revolutionary treasure.

Conducting In-Depth and Persistent Revolutionary Criticism
Purging the Poison of Liu Shaoqi

Great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "In the historical stage of socialism, there still exist classes, class contradictions, and class struggle, there exist the struggle between the two roads of socialism and capitalism, and there is the danger of capitalist restoration." The poor and lower-middle peasants of Jianchangpu firmly remember Chairman Mao's great teaching of "never forget class struggle," always taking class struggle as the main course in Mao Zedong Thought study classes, organizing a vast army of revolutionary criticism to launch a fierce attack on the class enemies. They are determined to thoroughly criticize and expose Liu Shaoqi and his agents, to suppress capitalist evil and raise socialist righteousness.

All the poor and lower-middle peasants in the brigade, regardless of gender or age, actively participated in the revolutionary criticism, each striving to be a critic. Poor peasant old woman Li Suqin, who had rarely participated in political activities before, since the start of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, enthusiastically responded to Chairman Mao's great call of "you must pay attention to state affairs, you must carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end," often took the stage to denounce Liu Shaoqi and his agents' attempt to restore capitalism. Eleven-year-old Li Chunting organized a group of "Red Children," going from house to house to propagate Chairman Mao's latest instructions. They took chalk and wrote "Down with Liu Shaoqi" slogans everywhere. The Red Children also bravely faced off against the capitalist-roaders, exposing and criticizing their anti-party, anti-socialism, and anti-Mao Zedong Thought crimes.

When the revolutionary criticism began, the young women organized the "Red Guards of Mao Zedong Thought." To expose and criticize the crimes of the capitalist-roaders, they actively wrote big-character posters. When there was no paper, they got up early to chop firewood in the mountains and sold it to buy paper. When the class enemies attacked them, they fought back tenaciously. They said, "If we live, we will fight to defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, if we die, we will die to defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line!"

In the past, Jianchangpu was deeply poisoned by Liu Shaoqi's "three freedoms and one contract." At that time, the capitalist-roaders openly advocated "three freedoms and one contract," leading the destruction of forests for private farming, attempting to lead people down the capitalist road. The broad poor and lower-middle peasants, following Chairman Mao's great teaching of "only socialism can save China," launched a persistent and in-depth revolutionary criticism of Liu Shaoqi and his agents' attempt to restore capitalism. Many old poor peasants hated the capitalist-roaders the most. Although they were illiterate and could not write criticism articles, they always rushed to speak at every meeting. Over sixty-year-old old hired laborer Qu Changxing, during the single farming wind, was driven up the mountain to farm alone by the capitalist-roaders, suffering "double bitterness." At every criticism meeting, he led his whole family to fiercely attack Liu Shaoqi. He said, "Liu Shaoqi is the root of evil. If we follow this big villain, we will have to pick up our begging baskets and sticks again. We must criticize him so that he is filthier than dog shit and can never rise again!"

Through persistent and in-depth revolutionary criticism, the class consciousness and two-line struggle consciousness of the broad poor and lower-middle peasants and the masses greatly increased. Many people deeply felt, "Chairman Mao's revolutionary line cannot be abandoned, class struggle cannot be forgotten, ideological remolding cannot be relaxed, revolutionary criticism cannot be stopped, private desires must be fought!" "We must purge the poison of Liu Shaoqi, if the poison is not purged, we will fall into the fire pit!"

Breaking the Bourgeois "Private" Character
Establishing the Proletarian "Public" Character

Great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "The transformation of worldview is a fundamental transformation." The poor and lower-middle peasants of Jianchangpu Brigade, with a heart full of loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, firmly grasp the use of great Mao Zedong Thought, closely combining the criticism of revisionism with the struggle against selfishness, striving to use Mao Zedong Thought to transform their worldview, everyone in their souls experiencing a revolutionary explosion, fiercely breaking the bourgeois "private" character, establishing the proletarian "public" character, and people's spiritual outlook achieving a new leap towards the communist ideological realm.

The revolutionary cadres of this brigade, in the study classes, took the lead in studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, took the lead in transforming their worldview, becoming the vanguards of breaking selfishness and establishing public spirit. Over fifty-year-old old poor peasant Sun Yufu, who had been a production team leader for many years, in the early days of the Cultural Revolution, some bad elements tried to force him to hand over power. He thought, "My head can be cut off, my blood can flow, but the seal of the poor and lower-middle peasants cannot be lost! The poor and lower-middle peasants believe in me, let me continue to be a cadre, I will be an 'old yellow cow' for the poor and lower-middle peasants for life, pull the revolutionary cart for life, never loosen the reins." He acted selflessly, putting the collective first in everything. His house had been leaking for over a year, but due to being busy with brigade work, he didn't have time to fix it. This spring, when it was time to plant vegetables in his family's vegetable plot, he told his wife, "You and the children plant them, Chairman Mao teaches us: 'completely selfless and dedicated to others,' cadres must lead in listening to Chairman Mao's words." After saying this, he hurried to the brigade to plant the fields.

The "Red Children" of Jianchangpu are small but have big aspirations, their young hearts are rooted in the public spirit. In winter, they braved the wind and snow to collect fertilizer for the brigade before dawn, went to the brigade to participate in labor after school, and studied and propagated Mao Zedong Thought at night. In over a year, just the "Red Children" of the second team collected over sixty carts of manure for the collective, picked up over two hundred mu of floating stones from the fields, hauled out over two hundred carts of stones, and picked up over a thousand jin of grain that had fallen to the ground during the harvest. They followed Chairman Mao's teaching of "completely selfless and dedicated to others," helping the brigade's illiterate elderly to study Chairman Mao's works, propagating Chairman Mao's latest instructions, helping the brigade's weak, elderly, sick, and disabled members to carry water and chop firewood. Everyone said they were Chairman Mao's good children.

Many old women, in the past, were busy around the stove and millstone, working white-headed for their families. Now, they strive to study Mao Zedong Thought, actively participate in revolutionary activities, and participate in collective production labor. These old people eagerly participated in revolutionary criticism, took the lead in speaking at the lectures on using Chairman Mao's works, and in labor, they sang songs of Chairman Mao's quotations, the more they worked, the happier they were, and during rest, they sang with the young women. They said, "We are not competing with you on who sings better, but on who is most loyal to Chairman Mao."

The guide of the "Iron Girls" team of the second team, Ma Fengqin, during the Cultural Revolution, organized the "Red Guards" with other iron girls. When evaluating work points using Dazhai's method, they compared low, yielding to each other; but in labor, they compared high, chasing each other. During the autumn harvest last year, Ma Fengqin fell ill, and the doctor told her to rest for fifty days. She thought, now is the busy autumn harvest season, production needs people, at this critical moment, how can I stay at home to rest, I should go with everyone to harvest the crops. During labor, she fainted four times, comrades persuaded her to go home to rest, she said, "We have criticized Liu Shaoqi's 'love yourself, protect your life and health' philosophy. When faced with a task, we must first think of the needs of the revolution, we cannot first consider our own bodies. My body can hold up, I will exert as much strength as I have, living to be the five kinds of people mentioned in 'In Memory of Norman Bethune,' and dying to be the 'heavier than Mount Tai' person mentioned in 'In Service of the People.'"

The young women of this brigade, each one like Ma Fengqin, each one with a revolutionary spirit. They took the lead in everything in revolution and production. Last year, they launched the activity of "carrying a knife to work and carrying a weed back," pressing a large amount of green manure for the brigade. When winter came, with cold weather, strong winds, and heavy snow, they continued to collect fertilizer for the brigade, every day braving the stars and snow, going up the mountain to carry rotten leaves, going down to the muddy fields to dig black soil, their hands blistered, their shoulders calloused, they did not complain, when tired, they recited Chairman Mao's teachings, thus collecting over two hundred carts of manure for the collective. They said, "The more difficult the environment, the better the battlefield for breaking selfishness and establishing public spirit, the more sweat flows, the better the arena for showing loyalty to Chairman Mao."

Following the Direction Indicated by Chairman Mao
Striving Forward

Vice Chairman Lin instructs us: "Mao Zedong Thought, when grasped by the broad masses, will become an endless and boundless force, becoming an atomic bomb of spiritual power." The poor and lower-middle peasants of Jianchangpu, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, used the sky-high revolutionary enthusiasm ignited during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to develop socialist collective economy, achieving astonishing results. Last year, despite suffering from spring floods, weed infestations, and pestilences, they achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest of grain, increasing production by 26% over the highest yield year of 1956. In the past, they relied on state-subsidized grain every year, but last year, for the first time, they sold over ten thousand jin of grain to the state. They also started from scratch, establishing a rice and flour processing plant, a small blacksmith forge, and a coal yard, and setting up a health station. The once despised backward brigade leaped to become a brigade praised by all. The broad poor and lower-middle peasants excitedly said, "Mastering Mao Zedong Thought can create miracles!" They reviewed the brigade's tremendous changes over the past two years, all saying it was the red sun that illuminated the poor mountain valley, they sincerely wished the most beloved great leader Chairman Mao eternal life! Eternal life!

Now, the poor and lower-middle peasants of Jianchangpu, with the help of the People's Liberation Army Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team, are continuing to firmly grasp class struggle, more persistently and deeply carrying out revolutionary criticism, launching a new high tide of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, further implementing Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production," striving to make Jianchangpu a red Mao Zedong Thought university.

    山村的飞跃
    ——记碱厂堡大队在毛泽东思想光辉照耀下发生的巨大变化
    辽宁省本溪县山城子公社碱厂堡大队，在两年来的无产阶级文化大革命中，人换精神地换装，发生了翻天覆地的巨大变化。这变化，充分显示了无产阶级文化大革命的深远意义，充分显示了毛泽东思想和毛主席革命路线的无穷威力。
      毛泽东思想的灿烂光辉
      照亮了贫下中农的心
    碱厂堡，两年前是本溪县有名的落后队，吃粮靠返销，花钱靠救济，人们都称它“减产堡”。有的社员编了个顺口溜，说：“碱厂堡是穷山窝，荒山恶水土地薄，走路步步踩石头，种地年年爬山坡，一年四季费力气，收入不如汗水多。”广大贫下中农在领到政府的返销粮和救济款时，都觉得对不起毛主席，迫切要求摘掉落后帽子。
    碱厂堡为什么成了“减产堡”？几年来大家常常找原因，但找来找去，有人认为还是顺口溜里说的那一条：地薄土质差。可是，也有人不同意，他们说：“大寨的地比我们的薄，为什么人家年年增产？”那么，原因究竟在哪里？
    毛泽东思想的灿烂光辉照亮了贫下中农的心。在轰轰烈烈的无产阶级文化大革命运动中，人民解放军毛泽东思想宣传队满腔热情地向碱厂堡的贫下中农宣传毛泽东思想，和贫下中农一道学习毛主席关于阶级和阶级斗争的伟大教导。伟大的毛泽东思想使贫下中农看清了碱厂堡过去落后的根源。碱厂堡过去之所以成为“减产堡”，就在于当地党内一小撮走资派忠实执行中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义路线，疯狂鼓吹“三自一包”，妄图复辟资本主义；就在于党内一小撮走资派和没有改造好的地、富、反、坏、右分子勾结在一起，打击、陷害贫下中农，压制贫下中农建设社会主义的积极性；就在于党内一小撮走资派极力阻挠广大贫下中农学习毛主席著作，妄图使贫下中农离开毛主席指引的道路。
    在毛泽东思想的指引下，贫下中农找到了碱厂堡落后的根源之后，便高高地举起“对反动派造反有理”的大旗，发动了对中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人的大揭发、大批判、大斗争。
    广大贫下中农说，中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人越是反对我们活学活用毛主席著作，我们越是要把活学活用毛主席著作摆在一切工作的首位。他们通过忆苦思甜，对伟大领袖毛主席更加无限热爱、无限忠诚，对伟大的毛泽东思想更加自觉地学，自觉地用。现在，在碱厂堡，广大贫下中农家家挂起毛主席像，户户毛主席语录红满墙，个个学习“老三篇”。七十四岁的贫农符老妈妈，天天领着孙子给毛主席像敬礼，祝毛主席万寿无疆，唱《东方红》。有人说：“老奶奶，你牙都没剩几颗，唱歌漏风，调都不准啦。”她说：“音调不准感情深，唱的是咱贫下中农一片心。”贫农社员吴秀琴，把上学的十二岁的儿子叫到跟前，要他教自己学习“老三篇”。儿子教，妈妈学，越学心里越亮堂，越学越愿学。到晚上躺在炕上，她还要和全家学一条毛主席语录。她说：“毛主席的书是指路明灯，咱贫下中农要革命就必须读毛主席的书。”
    在解放军毛泽东思想宣传队的帮助下，碱厂堡贫下中农遵照毛主席“办学习班，是个好办法，很多问题可以在学习班得到解决”的伟大教导，在队里办起了长年固定的毛泽东思想学习班，家家户户也办起了毛泽东思想学习班。自从办起了学习班，广大贫下中农，上至七八十岁的老人，下至七八岁的儿童，都更加如饥似渴地活学活用毛主席著作。他们说：“一天三顿饭，毛主席语录学三遍，不学不吃饭。觉前学一条，不学睡不着。”大家下地带着毛主席语录板，工前工间学一段。他们说：“地头挂起毛主席语录板，红太阳照亮咱心坎，一条语录千钧力，人换精神地高产。”赶车的青年社员孙景文，每天半夜要出车，在出车前坚持学习毛主席著作。他说：“毛泽东思想是法宝，赶车的离不了，一天不读毛主席的书，大车就要走邪道！”六十多岁的贫农老大娘李素琴，凡是有学习毛主席著作的辅导报告，她每场必到。她住在离大队四里远的山沟里，到大队来要翻过一座山，跨过一条河。冬天雪大风寒，小木桥上冰雪滑。她为了学习毛主席著作，就从桥上爬过来。她说，为了学习毛主席的革命宝书，天大的困难也能克服。
    持久深入地开展革命大批判
      肃清中国赫鲁晓夫的流毒
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“在社会主义这个历史阶段中，还存在着阶级、阶级矛盾和阶级斗争，存在着社会主义同资本主义两条道路的斗争，存在着资本主义复辟的危险性。”碱厂堡贫下中农牢记毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的伟大教导，始终把阶级斗争作为毛泽东思想学习班的主课，组织起浩浩荡荡的革命批判大军，向阶级敌人发动猛烈进攻。他们决心把中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人批深批透，批倒批臭，把资本主义的邪气压下去，使社会主义的正气升上来。
    全大队的贫下中农，不分男女老少，都积极参加了革命大批判，个个争当批判家。过去很少参加政治活动的贫农老大娘李素琴，从无产阶级文化大革命开始以来，积极响应毛主席“你们要关心国家大事，要把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底”的伟大号召，经常登台控诉中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人妄图复辟资本主义的滔天罪行。十一岁的李春庭组织了一帮“红孩子”，挨家串户宣传毛主席的最新指示。他们拿着粉笔到处写
  “打倒中国赫鲁晓夫”的标语。红孩子们还勇敢地和走资派进行面对面的斗争，针锋相对地揭露、批判他们反党、反社会主义、反毛泽东思想的罪恶事实。
    革命大批判一兴起，女青年们就组织了“毛泽东思想红卫兵”。为了揭发批判走资派的罪行，她们积极地写大字报，没有纸，就起早贪黑上山砍柴，卖了钱去买纸。当阶级敌人对她们进行围攻的时候，她们坚贞不屈地进行了顽强的斗争。她们说：“生，要为捍卫毛主席革命路线而战斗，死，要为捍卫毛主席革命路线而献身！”
    过去，碱厂堡受中国赫鲁晓夫“三自一包”的毒害较深。那时，走资派公开鼓吹“三自一包”，带头毁林搞私人开荒，妄图把人们引上资本主义道路。广大贫下中农遵照毛主席“只有社会主义能够救中国”的伟大教导，对中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人妄图复辟资本主义的滔天罪行，展开了深入持久的革命大批判。许多老贫农对走资派恨得最深，他们虽然不识字，写不了批判稿子，但每次开会都抢着发言。六十多岁的老雇农曲长兴，在刮单干风时被走资派赶上山去搞单干，饱受了“二遍苦”。在每次批判会上，他都带着全家老小向中国赫鲁晓夫猛烈开火。他说：“中国赫鲁晓夫是祸根。要是跟着这个大坏蛋跑，我们还得拿起要饭的篮子、讨饭的棍子。我们要把他批得比狗屎还臭，叫他永世不得翻身！”
    通过持久深入地开展革命大批判，广大贫下中农和社员群众阶级觉悟和两条路线斗争觉悟大大提高。许多人深有体会地说：“毛主席革命路线离不得，阶级斗争忘不得，思想改造松不得，革命大批判撂不得，私心不斗了不得！”“必须肃清中国赫鲁晓夫的流毒，流毒不肃清，必定进火坑！”
      狠破资产阶级的“私”字
      大立无产阶级的“公”字
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“世界观的转变是一个根本的转变”。碱厂堡大队的贫下中农，对伟大领袖毛主席心怀一个“忠”字，对伟大的毛泽东思想狠抓一个“用”字，把批修和斗私紧密结合起来，努力用毛泽东思想改造世界观，人人在灵魂深处爆发革命，狠破资产阶级的“私”字，大立无产阶级的“公”字，人们的精神面貌出现了迈向共产主义思想境界的新飞跃。
    这个队的革命干部，在学习班里带头活学活用毛泽东思想，带头改造世界观，成为破私立公的带头人。五十多岁的老贫农孙玉福，当了多年生产队长，文化大革命初期，有的坏分子企图迫使他交权。他想：“头可断，血可流，贫下中农的印把子不能丢！贫下中农相信我，让我继续当干部，我就要为贫下中农当一辈子‘老黄牛’，拉一辈子革命的车，永不松套。”他一心为公，处处为集体。他的房子漏雨一年多了，由于整天忙队里的工作，也顾不得收拾一下。今年春天，他家的菜栏子应当种菜了，他对老伴说：“你和孩子们种吧，毛主席教导我们说：‘毫不利己专门利人’，当干部的要带头听毛主席的话。”说完，他就忙着给队里种大田去了。
    碱厂堡的“红孩子”，人小志大，幼小心灵扎“公”根。在冬天，他们早起顶风冒雪为队里积肥，下学就到队里参加劳动，晚上学习和宣传毛泽东思想，一年多来，仅二队的“红孩子”就为集体拣了粪肥六十多大车，还拣了二百多亩地里的浮石，运出石头二百多大车，秋收时拣丢在地里的粮食一千多斤。他们遵循毛主席“毫不利己专门利人”的教导，帮助队里不识字的老年人学习毛主席著作，宣传毛主席最新指示，帮助队里老弱病残的社员挑水、劈柴。大家都说他们是毛主席的好孩子。
    许多老太太，过去围着锅台磨盘转，为一家人忙白了头。现在，她们努力学习毛泽东思想，积极参加革命活动，参加集体生产劳动。这些老人，争先恐后参加革命大批判，在学习毛主席著作讲用会上带头发言。在劳动中，她们唱着毛主席语录歌，越干越欢，休息时和女青年拉歌子。她们说：“我们和你们不是比谁唱的好听，而是比谁对毛主席最忠。”
    二队“钢姑娘”队的指导员马凤琴，在文化大革命中，和其他钢姑娘一起组织了“红卫兵”。她们在用大寨的办法评工分时，互相比低，你谦我让；而在劳动上又互相比高，你追我赶。去年秋收时，马凤琴得了病，医生要她休息五十天。她想，现在正是秋收大忙时节，生产上需要人，在这节骨眼上，我怎么能呆在家里养病，应该和大家一起去抢收庄稼。在劳动中她曾昏倒四次，同志们劝她回家休息，她说：“我们曾经批判过中国赫鲁晓夫的‘要钟爱自己，要保护自己的生命与健康’这套活命哲学。我们一事当前，就是要先想到革命的需要，决不能先考虑自己的身体。我的身体能顶得住，有多大劲就要发挥出多大的力量，活着要做《纪念白求恩》中讲的五种人，死了也要做《为人民服务》中讲的‘重于泰山’的人。”
    这个大队的女青年，个个都象马凤琴，人人身上都有股子革命的钢劲。她们在革命和生产中样样带头。她们去年开展了“上工带把刀，回来带把蒿”的活动，给队里压了大量绿肥。到了冬天，天寒地冻，风雪交加，她们还是继续为队里积肥，每天披星戴月，上山背烂树叶，下泥塘挖黑泥，手上磨出了血泡，肩上磨出了茧子，也不叫苦，累了就背诵毛主席的教导，就这样又为集体积了二百多车粪肥。她们说：“环境越艰苦，越是破私立公的好战场，汗水流的越多，越是向毛主席献忠心的考场。”
      沿着毛主席指引的方向奋勇前进
      把碱厂堡办成毛泽东思想大学校
    林副主席指示我们：“毛泽东思想为广大群众所掌握，就会变成无穷无尽的力量，变成威力无比的精神原子弹。”用毛泽东思想武装起来的碱厂堡贫下中农，把在无产阶级文化大革命运动中焕发出来的冲天革命干劲，用到发展社会主义集体经济上，取得了惊人的成就。他们去年在连续遭受春洪、草荒、病虫等自然灾害的情况下，夺得了粮食生产的空前大丰收，比产量最高的一九五六年还增产百分之二十六。过去年年吃国家返销粮，去年头一次向国家交售十万多斤粮食。他们还白手起家，开办了米面加工厂、小型铁匠炉和民用煤场，设立了卫生点。一向被人们看不起的落后队，一跃而为人人称颂的红旗队了。广大贫下中农兴奋地说：“掌握了毛泽东思想就能创造奇迹！”他们回顾全大队两年来的巨大变化，都说是红太阳照亮了穷山沟，他们衷心敬祝最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席万寿无疆！万寿无疆！
    现在，碱厂堡贫下中农在人民解放军毛泽东思想宣传队的帮助下，沿着伟大领袖毛主席指引的方向，正在继续狠抓阶级斗争，更加持久而深入地开展革命大批判，掀起活学活用毛泽东思想的新高潮，进一步贯彻毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，为把碱厂堡办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校而奋斗。
