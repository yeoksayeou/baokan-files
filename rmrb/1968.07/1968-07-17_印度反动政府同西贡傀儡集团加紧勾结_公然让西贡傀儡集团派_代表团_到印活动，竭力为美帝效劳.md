The Indian reactionary government and the Saigon puppet group are intensifying their collusion. They openly allowed the Saigon puppet group to send a "delegation" to India to engage in activities, striving to serve the U.S. imperialists.

New Delhi, July 16 (Xinhua) — Recently, the Saigon puppet group sent a so-called "parliamentary delegation" to India to collude with the Indian reactionary government.

The Indian reactionary government's mouthpiece, the Indian News Agency, in a special pre-release on July 6 about this "delegation" arriving in India, openly referred to South Vietnam as a "country." However, due to the Saigon puppet group's extremely bad reputation, the Indian reactionary government pretended to be reluctant to give a warm reception. According to the Indian News Agency, during the delegation's activities in India, "there will be no high-level government leaders remaining in the capital."

However, a few days later, the Indian News Agency admitted that the Saigon puppet group's "delegation" received a warm welcome from India's Vice President Giri, Deputy Prime Minister Desai, and heads of various government departments, including the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Both sides held secret talks on issues such as the "Vietnam situation."

The extremely reactionary "delegation" of the Saigon puppet group in the Indian capital spoke openly, flattering the Indian reactionary government, opposing China, and attacking Pakistan. These American lackeys shouted slogans such as "respecting India's rights over Kashmir," revealing the reactionary stance of the U.S. imperialists, the Soviet revisionists, and the Indian reactionaries in denying the Kashmiri people's right to self-determination.

It is revealed that the Saigon puppet group's visit to New Delhi is part of its plan to visit South Korea, Thailand, Japan, and other countries. The Saigon puppet group's disgusting performance in India further exposed the Indian reactionaries' "non-aligned" facade, further revealing the Indian reactionary government's collusion with other loyal lackeys of the U.S. imperialists in Asia, and their evil deeds of striving to serve the U.S. imperialists.

    印度反动政府同西贡傀儡集团加紧勾结
    公然让西贡傀儡集团派“代表团”到印活动，竭力为美帝效劳
    新华社十六日讯　新德里消息：最近，西贡傀儡集团派了一个所谓“议会代表团”到印度去，同印度反动政府勾勾搭搭。
    印度反动政府的喉舌印度报业托辣斯，在七月六日特地预发的一条关于这个“代表团”将要到达印度的消息中，公然把南越叫作一个“国家”。但是，由于西贡傀儡集团名声实在太臭，印度反动政府曾假装出一副不便热情接待的姿态。据印度报业托辣斯说，这个“代表团”在印度活动期间，“将没有政府最高级领导人留在首都”。
    可是，过了几天，印度报业托辣斯承认，西贡傀儡集团的“代表团”，在十日前后受到了印度副总统吉里、副总理德赛和外交部等政府部门的头子的亲切接待。双方就“越南局势”等问题进行了密谈。
    反动透顶的西贡傀儡集团的“代表团”，在印度首都大放厥词，肉麻地吹捧印度反动政府，反对中国，攻击巴基斯坦。这些美国走狗叫喊的什么“要尊重印度对克什米尔的权利”，道出了美帝、苏修、印度反动派无理否认克什米尔人民自决权利的反动立场。
    据透露，西贡傀儡集团的“代表团”的新德里之行，是它到南朝鲜、泰国、日本等地活动的计划的一部分。西贡傀儡集团这次到印度的丑恶表演，进一步戳穿了印度反动派的“不结盟”幌子，更加暴露了印度反动政府同美帝在亚洲的其它忠实走卒们加紧勾结，竭力为美帝效劳的罪恶行径。
