After the publication of the experience of the Lingbao County Revolutionary Committee in implementing the revolutionization of the leading cadre, streamlining administration, and maintaining close ties with the masses, and the important editorial note from the People's Daily, our district revolutionary committee's standing committee immediately conducted a study session. Everyone agreed that the editorial note from the People's Daily conveys the voice of our great leader Chairman Mao and the orders of the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin. It further clarifies the direction for the construction of revolutionary committees at all levels. The experience of Lingbao County in streamlining administration is a model for implementing our great leader Chairman Mao's latest instruction to "implement unified leadership, break down overlapping administrative structures, streamline administration, and organize a revolutionary leading cadre that is connected to the masses." This experience, published at a time when revolutionary committees are emerging nationwide, has significant real-world implications. It will have a profound impact on preventing and opposing revisionism and consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat. We are determined to seriously study Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions and the important editorial note from the People's Daily. Like Lingbao County, we will seriously implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, focus on the fundamental task of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, intensify class struggle, carry out in-depth revolutionary criticism, do a good job of cleaning up the class ranks, streamline administration, and consolidate and develop the great achievements of the Cultural Revolution from an organizational perspective.

"Reform of state organs, the most fundamental point, is to connect with the masses." Following the teachings of our great leader Chairman Mao, after the establishment of the district revolutionary committee, we have focused on revolutionary criticism, criticized the counter-revolutionary revisionist line that China's Khrushchev promoted in the construction of political power, struck down the conservative and restorationist forces, initially cleaned up the class ranks within the organs, and implemented streamlining administration. After the reform of the organs, our eyes are turned downward, and our connection with the revolutionary masses has become closer. Now, after studying the experience of Lingbao County and the editorial note from the People's Daily, we feel that there is still a significant gap. We realize that the reform of the organs is not just about streamlining bloated structures and reducing personnel; it is more about the issue of what kind of power to establish. It is a major issue of whether to maintain close ties with the masses or to distance and detach from them. It is a major issue of ensuring that our newly born revolutionary committees never change color. The revolutionary power of the proletariat must take root among the masses and at the grassroots level, fundamentally changing the past phenomenon of detachment from the masses and reality. The personnel of the newly born revolutionary committees must break the old habit of "sitting in the office to handle work." They must, like the revolutionary cadres of Lingbao County, go to factories, shops, schools, and alleys to handle work, learn from the masses, and help the masses solve problems. Personnel of state organs can only strengthen their mass perspective, raise their class consciousness, deepen their understanding of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and achieve ideological transformation by immersing themselves in revolutionary struggles, production frontlines, and revolutionary masses.

After streamlining the organs, how do we do a good job in the face of many tasks and few people? We must, like Lingbao County, focus on the fundamentals among the myriad tasks. We regard studying, executing, propagating, and defending Chairman Mao's instructions, firmly executing Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and timely transmitting the battle orders and policies of the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin to the masses as the fundamental task of the revolutionary committee. We establish many Mao Zedong Thought study classes, arm the masses with Mao Zedong Thought, and directly convey the party's policies to the masses. Under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, the broad revolutionary masses creatively engage in revolutionary struggles and production labor. We only learn from the masses and play a role in "threading the needle," summarizing and promoting the advanced experiences of the revolutionary masses. Our district revolutionary committee pays attention to the ideological revolutionization of leading cadres at all levels. Through the revolutionary committees at all levels, we maintain close ties with the broad revolutionary masses, unite all revolutionary forces, strike down a handful of class enemies, and accomplish the party's combat tasks for each period.

We are determined to take Lingbao County as an example, seriously implement Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, and strive to build a district-level power that is revolutionary and closely connected to the masses.

    革命政权永不变色的重要保证
    上海市徐汇区革命委员会
    《灵宝县革委会实行领导班子革命化，精兵简政，密切联系群众》的经验和《人民日报》的重要编者按发表以后，我们区革命委员会常委会立即进行了学习。大家认为：《人民日报》的编者按，传达了伟大领袖毛主席的声音，传达了以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的号令，为各级革委会的建设进一步指明了方向。灵宝县革委会精兵简政的经验，是落实我们伟大领袖毛主席“实行一元化的领导，打破重叠的行政机构，精兵简政，组织起一个革命化的联系群众的领导班子”的最新指示的好样板。这一经验在当前全国革命委员会联翩出现的大好形势下发表，有着重大的现实意义，对于防修、反修和巩固无产阶级专政将会产生深远的影响。我们决心认真学习毛主席的一系列最新指示，学习《人民日报》的这一重要编者按，象灵宝县那样，认真落实毛主席的最新指示，狠抓活学活用毛泽东思想这个根本，狠抓阶级斗争，深入开展革命大批判，做好清理阶级队伍的工作，实行精兵简政，从组织上巩固和发展无产阶级文化大革命的伟大成果。
    “国家机关的改革，最根本的一条，就是联系群众。”我们遵照伟大领袖毛主席的教导，在区革命委员会建立以后，狠抓革命大批判，批判了中国赫鲁晓夫在政权建设方面所推行的反革命修正主义路线，击破了保守复旧势力，初步清理了机关的阶级队伍，实行了精兵简政。机构改革以后，使我们眼睛向下，同革命群众的联系密切了。现在，学习了灵宝县的经验和《人民日报》编者按，我们感到差距还很大很大。我们认识到：机关改革，不仅仅是精简臃肿的机构，减少一些人员的事，更重要的是建立什么样的政权的问题，是密切联系群众，还是疏远和脱离群众的大问题，是保证我们新生的革命委员会永不变色的大问题。无产阶级的革命政权，要扎根于群众，扎根于基层，从根本上改变过去脱离群众、脱离实际的现象。新生的革命委员会的工作人员，必须打破“坐办公室办公”的旧习惯，要象灵宝县的革命干部那样，到工厂、到商店、到学校、到里弄去办公，向群众学习，帮助群众解决问题。国家机关工作人员，只有深入到革命斗争中去，深入到生产第一线去，深入到革命群众中去，才能加强群众观点，提高阶级觉悟，加深对毛主席的革命路线的理解，实现世界观的改造。
    精简机构以后，在人少事多的情况下，怎样做好工作？就是要象灵宝县那样，千头万绪抓根本。我们把学习、执行、宣传和捍卫毛主席的指示，坚定地执行毛主席的革命路线，及时地把以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的战斗号令和方针政策，传达到群众中去，作为革命委员会的根本任务。我们大办毛泽东思想学习班，用毛泽东思想武装群众，把党的方针政策直接交给群众。广大革命群众在毛泽东思想的指引下，创造性地进行革命斗争和生产劳动。我们只是向群众学习，起一个“穿针引线”的作用，把革命群众的先进经验总结起来，发扬推广。我们区革命委员会注意抓各级领导班子的思想革命化，通过各级革命委员会密切联系广大革命群众，团结一切革命力量，打击一小撮阶级敌人，实现党的各个时期的战斗任务。
    我们决心以灵宝县为榜样，认真落实毛主席的一系列最新指示，为建设一个密切联系群众的革命化的区级政权而斗争。
