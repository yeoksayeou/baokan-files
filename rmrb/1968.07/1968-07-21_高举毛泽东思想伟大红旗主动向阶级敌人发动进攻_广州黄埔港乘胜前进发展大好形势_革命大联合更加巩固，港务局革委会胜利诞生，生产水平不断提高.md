In the radiant light of the great leader Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and under the impetus of the national railway and transportation conference personally approved by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, the revolutionary workers of Guangzhou Huangpu Port are hoisting high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought. They are fiercely attacking a handful of class enemies who are sabotaging the revolution and production, achieving double victories in both revolution and production. The Revolutionary Committee of Huangpu Port Management Bureau has been born victorious amidst the stormy waves of class struggle. Under the leadership of the Revolutionary Committee, all revolutionary workers of the port are advancing victoriously, further developing the excellent situation in revolution and production.

Huangpu Port is the largest international port in southern China, tasked with the honorable mission of transporting aid to Vietnam and other materials. It is also an important front for propagating Mao Zedong Thought, the great victories of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and the great achievements of socialist construction in China to sailors from all over the world. For many years, the Chinese Khrushchev and a handful of the biggest capitalist roaders within the Party, along with their agents in the transportation sector, have been vigorously promoting the counter-revolutionary revisionist line in the port, attempting to restore capitalism. During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the proletarian revolutionaries and revolutionary workers of Huangpu Port, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, followed Mao's teaching of "It is reasonable to rebel against reactionaries," and seized all power from the handful of capitalist roaders. They launched a vigorous campaign of revolutionary criticism and achieved one victory after another. At this crucial moment of winning a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin personally approved the convening of the national railway and transportation conference and received the representatives attending the conference, greatly encouraging and inspiring the proletarian revolutionaries and revolutionary workers of Huangpu Port. They immediately organized Mao Zedong Thought study classes, initiating a mass movement to seriously study and implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions and the spirit of the national railway and transportation conference.

Just as the revolutionary situation in Huangpu Port and the Guangzhou region was becoming better and better, a handful of class enemies, in a desperate attempt to save their doomed fate, resorted to every possible means to create divisions and sabotage unity. They tried to disrupt production to achieve their evil goal of sabotaging the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and interfering with Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment. In this fierce class struggle, the proletarian revolutionaries and revolutionary workers of Huangpu Port, with limitless loyalty to Chairman Mao, Mao Zedong Thought, and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, firmly grasped the correct direction of struggle. With the help of the People's Liberation Army's leftist support troops, they focused on class struggle, eliminated all interference, persisted in making revolution on the spot, and correctly handled the contradictions between the two types of different natures. They united all possible forces, directing the spearhead of struggle against a handful of traitors, spies, unrepentant capitalist roaders, and other class enemies. They used Chairman Mao's teachings on class and class struggle as weapons and used the crimes of class enemies as living examples to fiercely criticize the "class struggle extinction" theory of the Chinese Khrushchev. In doing so, they not only organizationally eliminated class enemies and purified the revolutionary ranks but also further aroused the deep hatred of the revolutionary masses towards the Chinese Khrushchev and all class enemies, making Chairman Mao's great teaching of "never forget class struggle" deeply rooted in people's hearts. In the struggle against common enemies, the revolutionary great alliance was further consolidated.

The "Sixteen Points" personally drafted by Chairman Mao points out: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a powerful driving force for the development of social productive forces in our country." The revolutionary workers of Huangpu Port channelled the boundless enthusiasm unleashed in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution into production. They worked with all their might, united as one, supported each other, and continuously improved the port's production level. Since the second quarter, the port's cargo throughput has increased by nearly twenty million tons compared to the first quarter. The time large ships spend docked at the port has also been significantly reduced. In May and June, the average time large ships spent docked at the port was reduced by half compared to before April.

    高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗主动向阶级敌人发动进攻
    广州黄埔港乘胜前进发展大好形势
    革命大联合更加巩固，港务局革委会胜利诞生，生产水平不断提高
    据新华社广州二十日电　在伟大领袖毛主席一系列最新指示的光辉照耀下，在毛主席和林副主席亲自批准召开的全国铁路、交通会议的推动下，广州黄埔港广大革命职工高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，狠抓阶级斗争，主动向破坏抓革命、促生产的一小撮阶级敌人发动猛烈进攻，取得了革命和生产的双胜利。黄埔港务管理局革命委员会已经在阶级斗争的大风大浪中胜利诞生。全港革命职工在革委会的领导下正乘胜前进，进一步发展革命和生产的大好形势。
    黄埔港是我国南方最大的一个国际港口，担负着运送援越物资等光荣任务，也是向来自世界各国的海员宣传毛泽东思想，宣传无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利，宣传我国社会主义建设伟大成就的重要阵地。多年来，中国赫鲁晓夫等党内一小撮最大的走资派及其在交通部门的代理人，竭力在港口推行反革命修正主义路线，妄图复辟资本主义。无产阶级文化大革命中，黄埔港的无产阶级革命派和广大革命职工，在毛主席无产阶级革命路线的指引下，遵循毛主席“对反动派造反有理”的教导，从一小撮走资派手里夺回了一切权力，并开展了轰轰烈烈的革命大批判运动，取得了一个又一个胜利。在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的关键时刻，伟大领袖毛主席和他的亲密战友林副主席亲自批准召开了全国铁路、交通会议，并接见了出席会议的代表，使黄埔港的无产阶级革命派和广大革命职工受到极大的鼓舞和鞭策。他们立即举办毛泽东思想学习班，掀起了认真学习和贯彻毛主席一系列最新指示和全国铁路、交通会议精神的群众性热潮。
    正当黄埔港和广州地区的革命形势越来越好的时候，一小撮阶级敌人为了挽救他们即将灭亡的命运，千方百计制造分裂，破坏团结，妄图以破坏生产来达到破坏无产阶级文化大革命，干扰毛主席伟大战略部署的罪恶目的。在这样一场激烈的阶级搏斗中，黄埔港的无产阶级革命派和广大革命职工，无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于毛泽东思想，无限忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，牢牢掌握斗争的大方向。他们在人民解放军支左部队的帮助下，狠抓阶级斗争，排除一切干扰，坚持就地闹革命，并且正确处理两类不同性质的矛盾，团结一切可以团结的力量，把斗争矛头对准一小撮叛徒、特务、死不改悔的走资派和其他阶级敌人。他们以毛主席有关阶级和阶级斗争的教导为武器，以阶级敌人的罪行作为活生生的事例，狠狠批判了中国赫鲁晓夫的“阶级斗争熄灭”论，这样不但在组织上清除了阶级敌人，纯洁了革命队伍，而且进一步激发了广大革命群众对中国赫鲁晓夫以及一切阶级敌人的深仇大恨，使毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的伟大教导深入人心。在共同对敌的斗争中，进一步巩固了革命的大联合。
    毛主席亲自主持制定的“十六条”指出：“无产阶级文化大革命是使我国社会生产力发展的一个强大的推动力。”黄埔港广大革命职工，把在无产阶级文化大革命中焕发出来的冲天干劲用到生产上，他们争分夺秒，同心协力，互相支援，使港口生产水平不断提高。第二季度以来，港口货物的吞吐量比第一季度增加将近二十万吨，大船在港口停泊的时间也大大缩短，五、六月份，大船平均停泊在港口的时间比四月份以前缩短了二分之一。
