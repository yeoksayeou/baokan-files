Following Chairman Mao's great instructions, further improving the relationship between cadres and the masses

The cadres and members of Mengjia Production Brigade democratically formulated the "Supporting Cadres and Loving the Masses" pact

The entire brigade has seen a lively scene where cadres care for and protect the masses, and the masses enthusiastically support the cadres

According to Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, July 10th

The leading cadre group of Mengjia People's Commune Mengjia Production Brigade, with the help of the People's Liberation Army Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team, earnestly implemented Chairman Mao's great instructions of "The reform of state organs, the most fundamental point, is to connect with the masses" and "We must solve the problem of the relationship between superiors and subordinates, and improve the relationship between cadres and the masses." They studied the glorious tradition of the PLA's "supporting cadres and loving soldiers," democratically formulated the "Supporting Cadres and Loving the Masses" pact, further mobilized the revolutionary enthusiasm of the cadres and members, and made the relationship between the cadres and the masses even closer. The revolutionary and production situation is getting better and better.

The "Supporting Cadres and Loving the Masses" pact was first formulated by the fourth production team of Mengjia Production Brigade. The relationship between cadres and members in this team was not close in the past. After the new leading cadre group was established, the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team of the brigade organized the cadres to participate in the Mao Zedong Thought study class, studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions on "improving the relationship between cadres and the masses" and the "Three Articles," helping the cadres to use Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, summarize past experiences and lessons, and strengthen the mass line. Through study, many cadres raised their consciousness, examined their own manifestations of detachment from the masses, and expressed their determination to highlight the proletarian "public" character, carry forward the Party's good tradition of closely connecting with the masses, honestly learn from the masses, actively accept the masses' criticisms and supervision, and serve as good servants of the people. At the same time, the team held a Mao Zedong Thought study class for all members, studying Chairman Mao's teachings on correctly handling the relationship between cadres and members, and raising the members' consciousness. Some members said: "In the past, the relationship between cadres and members was not close, and we cannot just blame the cadres; we also have responsibility. In the future, we must actively support the cadres' work, and for leadership that is correct and in line with Mao Zedong Thought, we must actively support it and firmly support it; for the cadres' shortcomings and mistakes, we must point them out in a timely manner and give sincere criticism to help the cadres do a good job."

On the basis of raising awareness, the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team introduced the glorious tradition of the PLA's "officers and soldiers united" and "supporting cadres and loving soldiers." At this time, several old poor peasants suggested formulating a "Supporting Cadres and Loving the Masses" pact according to the team's situation. This suggestion immediately received the enthusiastic support of all cadres and members in the team. Everyone spoke up, and after repeated discussions, the "Supporting Cadres and Loving the Masses" pact of the fourth team was formulated.

The leading cadre group of the brigade promptly grasped this new thing that emerged among the masses and promoted it within the brigade. Soon, all eight production teams in the brigade formulated the "Supporting Cadres and Loving the Masses" pact.

The "Supporting Cadres and Loving the Masses" pact of Mengjia Production Brigade is divided into two parts: cadres loving the masses and members supporting cadres. The requirements for cadres loving the masses are: to take the lead in studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, to do everything according to Chairman Mao's instructions; to strengthen ideological and political work, to care for the progress of members from a political perspective; to firmly rely on the poor and lower-middle peasants, to resolutely suppress the sabotage activities of landlords, rich farmers, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists; to consult with the masses on everything, to be fair in handling matters, and not to be influenced by personal feelings; to be both an "official" and a "commoner," to study and work with the members, to care for the lives of the masses, to frequently visit the poor and listen to their opinions humbly.

The requirements for members supporting cadres are: to strive to study and apply Mao Zedong Thought, to do everything according to Chairman Mao's words; to firmly obey the correct leadership that is in line with Mao Zedong Thought, not to engage in factionalism, and not to promote anarchism; to respect, care for, unite with, help, and support revolutionary cadres, and to prevent bad people from stirring up trouble between cadres and members; to actively participate in collective production labor, to observe labor discipline; to unite and love each other, to consider the overall situation, and to cherish collective property; to welcome the cadres' criticisms and help, and to voluntarily check and correct one's shortcomings; if cadres have mistakes or problems, do not talk behind their backs, but find them for individual talks or discuss them in meetings, etc.

After the various production teams of this brigade earnestly formulated and implemented the "Supporting Cadres and Loving the Masses" pact, many new situations emerged between the cadres and members.

Originally, the relationship between cadres and members in the fourth team was not close. Due to the implementation of the "Supporting Cadres and Loving the Masses" pact, there have been great changes: cadres insist on Mao Zedong Thought as the guiding principle, set an example in everything, closely connect with the masses, and care for the lives of the masses; members actively provide ideas and methods for the cadres, enthusiastically support the cadres in doing a good job. The cadres and members of the entire brigade are united, thinking and working together, with a lively revolution and a booming production, and the situation is getting better and better.

    遵照毛主席的伟大教导，进一步搞好干部和群众的关系
    孟家大队干部社员民主制订拥干爱群公约
    全大队出现了干部关心爱护群众，群众热情支持干部的生动局面
    据新华社济南十日电　山东历城县孟家公社孟家大队领导班子，在解放军毛泽东思想宣传队的帮助下，认真落实毛主席“国家机关的改革，最根本的一条，就是联系群众”和“要很好地解决上下级关系问题，搞好干部和群众的关系”的伟大指示，学习解放军“拥干爱兵”的光荣传统，民主制订了“拥干爱群”公约，进一步调动了广大干部、社员的革命积极性，使大队干群之间的关系更加密切，革命和生产形势越来越好。
      “拥干爱群”公约是孟家大队第四生产队首先制订的。这个生产队过去干群关系不够密切。新的领导班子成立后，在这个大队的解放军毛泽东思想宣传队就组织干部参加毛泽东思想学习班，学习毛主席要“搞好干部和群众的关系”的最新指示和“老三篇”，帮助干部以毛泽东思想为武器，总结过去的经验教训，增强群众观点。通过学习，不少干部提高了觉悟，检查了自己脱离群众的一些表现，表示一定要突出无产阶级“公”字，发扬我党紧密联系群众的好作风，老老实实地向群众学习，主动地接受群众的批评和监督，当好人民的勤务员。与此同时，队里又举办了有全体社员参加的毛泽东思想学习班，学习了毛主席有关正确处理干群关系的教导，提高了社员的觉悟。有些社员说：“以前干群关系不密切，不能光怨干部，我们也有责任。今后一定积极支持干部的工作，凡是符合毛泽东思想的正确领导，都要积极拥护，坚决支持；对干部的缺点错误，要及时指出，诚恳批评，帮助干部做好工作。”
    在提高认识的基础上，毛泽东思想宣传队又向大家介绍了解放军“官兵一致”“拥干爱兵”的光荣传统。这时，几位老贫农建议，要根据队里的情况，制订一个“拥干爱群”公约。这个建议立即得到全队干部和社员的热烈支持。大家你一言，我一语，经过反复讨论，订出了四队的“拥干爱群”公约。
    大队领导班子及时抓住群众中涌现出来的这个新事物，在大队范围内进行了推广。不久，全大队八个生产队都相继制订了“拥干爱群”公约。
    孟家大队的“拥干爱群”公约，共分干部爱群和社员拥干两部分。干部爱群的要求是：带头活学活用毛泽东思想，处处照毛主席的指示办事；加强思想政治工作，从政治上关心社员的进步；坚定地依靠贫下中农，坚决镇压地、富、反、坏、右的破坏活动；遇事跟群众商量，办事公正，不动私人感情；“既当‘官’，又当老百姓”，和社员同学习，同劳动，关心群众生活，经常访贫问苦，虚心听取群众意见。
    社员拥干的要求是：努力活学活用毛泽东思想，事事听毛主席的话；坚决服从符合毛泽东思想的正确领导，不闹宗派，不搞无政府主义；尊重、关心、团结、帮助、支持革命干部，严防坏人挑拨干群关系；积极参加集体生产劳动，遵守劳动纪律；团结友爱，顾全大局，爱护集体财产；欢迎干部的批评帮助，有了缺点，自觉检查改正；干部有错误，有问题，不要背后说，要找他个别谈，或者会议上讲，等等。
    这个大队的各个生产队认真制订和执行“拥干爱群”公约后，干群之间出现了许多新气象。
    原来干群关系不够密切的四队，由于实行了“拥干爱群”公约，现在有了很大的变化：干部坚持毛泽东思想挂帅，处处以身作则，密切联系群众，关心群众生活；社员积极为干部出点子、想办法，热情支持干部做好工作。全大队干部群众团结一致，心往一处想，劲往一处使，革命轰轰烈烈，生产热气腾腾，形势越来越好。
