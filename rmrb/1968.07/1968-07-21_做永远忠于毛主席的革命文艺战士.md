Navigating the seas relies on the helmsman, and revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought. In the midst of the triumphant songs of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, our beloved Comrade Jiang Qing, who personally nurtured it, has once again presented the revolutionary modern ballet "The Red Detachment of Women" to the broad audience of the capital. As an actor in the ballet, my heart is filled with immense excitement.

A spring thunder shook the world, and the red sun illuminated the ballet stage. On October 8, 1964, our most beloved and great leader Chairman Mao personally watched the first revolutionary modern ballet in our country, "The Red Detachment of Women." Chairman Mao praised it, saying: "The direction is correct, the revolution is successful, and the art is also good." The radiant sunlight of Mao Zedong Thought made this artistic gem in the proletarian cultural treasury shine even more brilliantly.

I will never forget that most blessed day. When our great teacher and great leader Chairman Mao, radiant and vigorous, stepped onto the stage with a firm stride amidst thunderous cheers to meet us, my blood boiled, my eyes welled up with tears of excitement, and I tightly grasped his mighty hand that steers the world revolution. At that moment, I had so much to say to Chairman Mao! A thousand words, ten thousand words, could not express the love of a poor child from the old society, a descendant of the poor peasants, for Chairman Mao. I sincerely wish Chairman Mao longevity, eternal longevity!

The birth of the revolutionary modern ballet "The Red Detachment of Women" was under the radiant light of Mao Zedong Thought, led by our beloved Comrade Jiang Qing, who guided our revolutionary artists to break through the heavy obstacles and sabotage of the revisionist literary black line. Following Chairman Mao's great teachings of "ancient for modern use, foreign for Chinese use," and serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers with literature and art, we created and rehearsed it. During the creation process, Comrade Jiang Qing instructed us: Many countries' ballets have taken a path of decline and decadence. Our ballet must serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers. The great banner of proletarian ballet must be held high by us. She personally selected the theme of Chairman Mao's great thought on people's war, "The Red Detachment of Women," as the first play for ballet reform, and instructed us to go to Hainan Island to immerse ourselves in life. I and the creation team members went to Hainan Island for a period, living among the troops and soldiers, studying Chairman Mao's brilliant works, and training together. We often waded through water and climbed mountains, visiting revolutionary predecessors and listening to heroes recount the stories of the Red Detachment of Women's brave battles against the enemy. During those days, I felt as if I were on a battlefield filled with gunpowder, witnessing the heroic women soldiers of the Red Detachment of Women's regiment raising the red flag, brandishing swords, and charging into the enemy. With reverence, I visited the battlefields where the Red Detachment of Women once fought. The grass and trees of Qiongya are so magnificent! Remembering the heroes, learning from the heroes, praising the heroes, the heroic images inspire and educate me. I am determined to take the heroes as my example and forever sing the praises of proletarian heroes on the ballet stage, letting the workers, peasants, and soldiers forever occupy the stage of literature and art.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "If you are a bourgeois artist, you will not sing the praises of the proletariat but of the bourgeoisie; if you are a proletarian artist, you will not sing the praises of the bourgeoisie but of the proletariat and the working people: one of the two must be chosen." The focal point of the two-line struggle in the creation and rehearsal of "The Red Detachment of Women" is whether to stand on the revolutionary standpoint of the proletariat to sing the praises of the workers and peasants, or to stand on the reactionary standpoint of the bourgeoisie to slander and defame the proletariat and the working people.

Comrade Jiang Qing instructed us to highlight the heroic collective of the Red Army and the heroic image of Party representative Hong Changqing. However, counter-revolutionary revisionists like Lin Mo Han fiercely resisted and vehemently opposed. For example, in the scene "Hong Changqing's Martyrdom," the counter-revolutionary revisionists tried to peddle the traitor philosophy of the Chinese Khrushchev, attempting to defame the proletarian hero Hong Changqing. They said nonsense like, "Hong Changqing should enter the stage with his head down! This is true to life. Because he is injured and tortured severely." Comrade Jiang Qing was very angry after seeing it and sternly refuted the traitor philosophy of the Chinese Khrushchev, pointing out that in the martyrdom scene, Hong Changqing's fearless heroic spirit must be shown. He must stand tall when entering the stage and never bow his head! Our heroes are not afraid of death. To deal with the reactionaries, as long as you are not afraid of them, they will be afraid of you. Comrade Jiang Qing's instructions shone with the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought, like a sharp sword, piercing the ugly souls of the Chinese Khrushchev and his lackeys. A small group of counter-revolutionary revisionists' plot to defame and distort proletarian heroes and sabotage the revolutionary modern ballet "The Red Detachment of Women" shamefully failed.

Looking back at the entire battle process of the birth and growth of "The Red Detachment of Women," every victory was achieved under the personal guidance of our beloved Comrade Jiang Qing. It was Comrade Jiang Qing who, when the revisionist literary black line shrouded the ballet stage, brought us the radiant sunlight of Mao Zedong Thought; it was Comrade Jiang Qing who, with the spirit of a proletarian revolutionary, resolutely fought against the revisionist literary black line; it was Comrade Jiang Qing who taught us that to perform revolutionary plays, we must first be revolutionary people, and to sing the praises of the workers and peasants, we must love and be familiar with the workers and peasants. These important instructions gave us the confidence and immense strength for victory.

Red flags are like paintings, and triumphant songs are like tides. The new species of proletarian revolutionary literature nurtured by Comrade Jiang Qing—piano accompaniment "The Red Lantern" and large oil painting "Chairman Mao Goes to Anyuan"—were born in victory. This is another triumphant song of Mao Zedong Thought and a bountiful fruit of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. I am determined to learn from my revolutionary comrades. I will be a revolutionary artist who is infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, infinitely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

    做永远忠于毛主席的革命文艺战士
    工农兵芭蕾舞剧团　刘庆棠
    大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想。在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的凯歌声中，我们敬爱的江青同志亲自培育的，闪耀着毛泽东思想灿烂光辉的革命现代芭蕾舞剧《红色娘子军》，再次和首都的广大观众见面了。作为舞剧中的一个演员，我的心情是万分激动的。
    一声春雷震世界，红太阳照亮了芭蕾舞台。一九六四年十月八日，我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席亲自观看了我国第一部革命现代芭蕾舞剧《红色娘子军》。毛主席赞许说：
  “方向是对的，革命是成功的，艺术上也是好的。”毛泽东思想的灿烂阳光，使这颗无产阶级文艺宝库中的艺术明珠，焕发出更加夺目的光辉。
    我永远难忘那最最幸福的一天。当我们伟大的导师、伟大的领袖毛主席神采奕奕，容光焕发，迈着刚健的步伐，在雷鸣般的欢呼声中走上舞台接见我们的时候，我全身的热血在沸腾，两眼含着激动的热泪，紧紧握着他老人家那双掌握世界革命航向的巨手，长时间地仰望着我们心中最红最红的红太阳。此时此刻，我有多少话儿想对毛主席倾诉啊！千言万语，万语千言也表达不尽一个旧社会受苦的穷孩子，贫下中农的后代，对毛主席热爱的心情。我衷心敬祝毛主席万寿无疆，万寿无疆！
    革命现代芭蕾舞剧《红色娘子军》的诞生，是在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，由敬爱的江青同志率领我团革命文艺战士，冲破修正主义文艺黑线的重重阻挠和破坏，根据毛主席
  “古为今用，洋为中用”，文艺为工农兵服务的伟大教导，创作和排练出来的。在创作的过程中，江青同志指示：世界上许多国家的芭蕾舞已经走上了没落颓废的道路，我们的芭蕾舞要为工农兵服务。无产阶级芭蕾舞这面大旗要靠我们来扛。她亲自为我们选定了以表现毛主席的人民战争的伟大思想为题材的《红色娘子军》，作为芭蕾舞剧改革的第一个剧目，并指示我们到海南岛去深入生活。我和创作组的同志们怀着激动心情，到海南岛生活过一个时期，在部队里和战士们一道学习毛主席的光辉著作，一道练兵。还经常涉水登山，访问革命先辈，倾听英雄们讲述当年红色娘子军战士和敌人英勇战斗的故事。在那些日子里，我仿佛身临硝烟弥漫的战场，目睹娘子军英雄连的战士们高举红旗，奋臂挥刀，冲入敌群。我怀着崇敬的心情看了当年娘子军战斗过的战场。琼崖的一草一木是多么壮丽啊！忆英雄，学英雄，颂英雄，英雄的形象激励着我，教育着我。我决心以英雄为榜样，在芭蕾舞台上，永远歌颂无产阶级英雄，让工农兵永远占领文艺舞台。
    毛主席教导我们：“你是资产阶级文艺家，你就不歌颂无产阶级而歌颂资产阶级；你是无产阶级文艺家，你就不歌颂资产阶级而歌颂无产阶级和劳动人民：二者必居其一。”是站在无产阶级革命立场上歌颂工农兵，还是站在资产阶级反动立场上污蔑、丑化无产阶级和劳动人民？这是《红色娘子军》创作和排练过程中两条路线斗争的焦点。
    江青同志指示我们，要突出工农红军的英雄集体，突出党代表洪常青的英雄形象。可是反革命修正主义分子林默涵之流，却百般抵制，疯狂反对。例如《常青就义》这场戏里，反革命修正主义分子们就竭力贩卖中国赫鲁晓夫的叛徒哲学，妄图丑化无产阶级的英雄洪常青。他们胡说什么：“洪常青上场低头好！符合生活的真实。因为他受伤、受刑很重。”江青同志看后，非常气愤，义正词严地驳斥了中国赫鲁晓夫的叛徒哲学，指出就义这场戏，一定要表现出洪常青大无畏的英雄气概。上场时要挺立起来，决不低头！我们的英雄是不怕死的。对付反动派，只要你不怕他，他就怕你。江青同志的指示闪耀着毛泽东思想的光辉，象一把利剑，刺中了中国赫鲁晓夫及其爪牙们的丑恶灵魂。一小撮反革命修正主义分子妄图丑化、歪曲无产阶级英雄，破坏革命现代芭蕾舞剧《红色娘子军》的阴谋，可耻地失败了。
    回顾《红色娘子军》的诞生和成长的整个战斗历程，每一个胜利，都是在敬爱的江青同志亲自指导下取得的。是江青同志，在那反革命修正主义文艺黑线的乌云笼罩着芭蕾舞台的时候，给我们带来了毛泽东思想的灿烂阳光；是江青同志，以她那无产阶级革命家的硬骨头精神，同反革命修正主义文艺黑线进行了坚决的斗争；是江青同志，谆谆教导我们要演革命戏，必须先做革命人，歌颂工农兵必须热爱和熟悉工农兵。这些重要指示，给了我们胜利的信心和无比的力量。
    红旗如画，凯歌似潮。由江青同志亲自培育的无产阶级革命文艺的新品种——钢琴伴唱《红灯记》和大幅油画《毛主席去安源》胜利诞生了。这是毛泽东思想的又一曲凯歌，是无产阶级文化大革命的丰硕成果。我决心向革命战友们学习。做一名无限忠于毛主席、无限忠于毛泽东思想、无限忠于毛主席革命路线的革命文艺战士。
