Shanghai's financial and commercial frontline revolutionary cadres and workers, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, resolutely implement Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production." While fiercely fighting against the enemy, they actively do a good job in the procurement, sales, and storage of commodities. The entire city's summer market presents a lively and revolutionary scene.

Since the summer, the Shanghai market has been abundant with a variety of food, clothing, and daily necessities, with ample supplies. Staples such as grain, cotton, and oil are well-stocked. Summer necessities like undershirts, singlets, towels, and soap, as well as summer clothing and light-colored cotton fabrics, come in a variety of colors and styles, with sales volumes significantly increasing. The supply of subsidiary food items is also improving. In the vegetable markets, pork and poultry are abundantly supplied. The daily market volume of vegetables now reaches over 80,000 piculs, fully meeting the needs of the masses. This year, many regions have had a bumper harvest of fruits. Peaches, plums, melons, and watermelons are continuously transported in, with quantities far exceeding last year's. The variety of cold drinks is diverse, and the stock is at its highest level in recent years.

The thriving scene of Shanghai's summer market is a fruit of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has greatly promoted the leapfrog development of industrial and agricultural production, providing a solid material foundation for the socialist market. In recent months, the total value of daily necessities procured by Shanghai's commercial departments has increased month by month. The procurement volume of commodities closely related to people's lives, such as bicycles, watches, light bulbs, matches, soap, cotton cloth, wool, pens, paper, and antibiotics, has shown significant growth. In addition to supplying the Shanghai market, a large number of industrial products are continuously shipped out to support urban and rural markets nationwide.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Conducting study classes is a good method; many problems can be solved in study classes." Following Chairman Mao's instructions, the revolutionary cadres and workers on Shanghai's financial and commercial frontline have held various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes this year, implementing Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production." They study "Old Three Articles" and learn from Comrade Lei Feng, using Mao Zedong Thought to criticize and repudiate revisionism. To better arrange the summer market, Shanghai's commercial departments have sent numerous personnel to production areas to organize agricultural and sideline product sources and conduct investigations. They promptly reflect the needs of workers, peasants, and soldiers, as well as market supply and demand situations, to industrial departments, supporting industrial departments in producing more and better commodities to enter the market. Many revolutionary committee members of various units, following Chairman Mao's instruction of "being both an official and a common person," have stepped out of their offices and gone to the frontline. The revolutionary cadres of the textile procurement and supply station have also organized Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams to go to textile factories and propagate Mao Zedong Thought, effectively promoting factory revolutionary cadres to implement Chairman Mao's instruction of "must grasp cloth production." Under the close cooperation between factory and commercial department revolutionary cadres, the total procurement value of textiles in the second quarter has far exceeded that of the first quarter.

The revolutionary cadres and workers on Shanghai's financial and commercial frontline firmly remember Chairman Mao's great instruction of "never forget class struggle." They firmly grasp the key of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines, using revolution to lead production. This year, in the struggle to clean up class ranks, the revolutionary cadres and workers have launched one attack after another against a handful of class enemies, with the revolutionary big-character posters burning more fiercely. The revolutionary cadres and workers, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, fiercely criticize and repudiate the revisionist black goods spread by China's Khrushchev and his agents in Shanghai, Chen Pi-xian and Cao Qi-qiu, such as the theory of "class struggle extinguished," "profit in command," "material incentive," and "production first," eliminating their poisonous influence. This has promoted the deepening of the struggle against the enemy and the victorious advancement of market work. The revolutionary cadres and workers on Shanghai's financial and commercial frontline have also cooperated with relevant departments to severely crack down on market speculation and profiteering activities, implementing mass dictatorship on a handful of speculators and profiteers. They have smashed the enemy's evil plot of disrupting the market to disrupt the revolution, ensuring the prosperity and prosperity of the socialist market.

    文化大革命推动生产飞跃发展，为社会主义市场提供丰厚物质基础
    上海夏令市场呈现一派欣欣向荣景象
    新华社上海十八日电　上海财贸战线广大革命职工高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚决贯彻执行毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，在狠抓对敌斗争的同时，积极做好商品购销调存工作，全市夏令市场呈现一派生气勃勃的大好革命景象。
    入夏以来，上海市场上吃、穿、用商品丰富多采，供应充沛；人民生活必需品粮、棉、油，库存充裕。汗衫、背心、毛巾、药皂等夏令百货，以及夏令服装、浅色棉布等，花色品种繁多，销量大幅度上升。副食品供应情况也越来越好。菜场里，猪肉、家禽大量供应。蔬菜的每天上市量现在高达八万多担，充分满足了广大人民的需要。今年许多地区水果丰收，桃子、李子、甜瓜、西瓜等夏令水果源源运到，数量比去年大大增加。冷饮品种多样，备货之多，超过了近几年来的最高水平。
    上海夏令市场欣欣向荣的大好形势，是无产阶级文化大革命的丰硕成果。无产阶级文化大革命，大大推动了工农业生产的飞跃发展，为社会主义市场提供了丰厚的物质基础。近几个月来，上海商业部门收购的日用工业品总值，一月高过一月。自行车、手表、灯泡、火柴、肥皂、棉布、呢绒、钢笔、纸张、抗菌素等与人民生活关系密切的商品，收购量的增长都很显著，除供应上海市场外，大批工业品源源外运，支援了全国城乡市场。
    毛主席教导说：“办学习班，是个好办法，很多问题可以在学习班得到解决。”上海财贸战线广大革命职工遵照毛主席这一教导，今年以来大办各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，落实毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针。他们大学“老三篇”，以门合同志为榜样，用毛泽东思想斗私批修。为了把夏令市场安排得更好，上海商业部门派出大批人员深入产地，组织农副产品货源，进行调查研究，及时把工农兵需要和市场供需情况反映给工业部门，支持工业部门生产更多更好更适销的商品投入市场。许多单位的革命委员会成员，遵照毛主席提出的“既当‘官’，又当老百姓”的教导，走出办公室，深入第一线。纺织品采购供应站的无产阶级革命派还组织毛泽东思想宣传小分队，去纺织工厂宣传毛泽东思想，有力地推动了工厂革命职工落实毛主席关于“必须把布匹抓紧”的指示。在工厂和商业部门革命职工的紧密协作配合下，第二季度纺织品的收购总值，大大超过了第一季度。
    上海财贸战线广大革命职工牢记毛主席的“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的伟大教导，紧紧抓住阶级斗争和两条路线斗争这个纲，以革命统帅生产。今年以来，在开展清理阶级队伍的斗争中，广大革命职工、革命干部，向一小撮阶级敌人发起了一次比一次更加猛烈的进攻，革命大批判的熊熊烈火越烧越旺。广大革命职工，以毛泽东思想为武器，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫及其在上海的代理人陈丕显、曹荻秋之流散布的“阶级斗争熄灭”论、“利润挂帅”、“物质刺激”、“生产第一”等反革命修正主义黑货，肃清其流毒，推动了对敌斗争的深入开展，推动了市场工作的胜利进行。上海财贸战线革命职工还配合有关部门，狠狠打击了市场上的投机倒把活动，对一小撮投机倒把分子实行了群众专政，粉碎了阶级敌人以破坏市场来破坏革命的罪恶阴谋，保证了社会主义市场的繁荣兴旺。
