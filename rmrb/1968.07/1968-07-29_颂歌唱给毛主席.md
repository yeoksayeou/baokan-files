	Ode to Chairman Mao
	Air Force Unit, Sun Ruìqīng

	Wearing the red star cap, dressed in green military uniform,
	I stand guard for Chairman Mao, the battle song is high and the steps are swift...
	The pilot enters the cockpit, infinite happiness and joy.
	I pilot the warplane into the sky, flying over the countless mountains of the motherland.
	What do soldiers love the most? They love Mount Jinggang the most!
	Chairman Mao raised the red flag on the mountain,
	The red light illuminated the earth and the sky!
	I pilot the warplane in the sky, flying over the countless rivers of the motherland.
	What do soldiers love the most? They love the Yanhe River the most!
	Chairman Mao waved his brush by the river,
	The blueprint of the revolution shines with brilliance!
	I pilot the warplane in the sky, flying over the countless cities of the motherland.
	What do soldiers love the most? They love Beijing the most!
	Chairman Mao ascended Tiananmen Gate,
	The masses sang "The East is Red" loudly!
	I pilot the warplane beyond the sky, flying over the rivers and seas of the motherland.
	What do soldiers love the most? They love Zhongnanhai the most!
	Chairman Mao waved his mighty hand by the sea,
	The revolutionary thunder rolled in!
	I pilot the warplane for ten thousand miles,
	My heart is thinking of Chairman Mao.
	The soldiers' feelings are deep, they love Chairman Mao the most!
	Chairman Mao is the red sun in our hearts,
	His brilliance shines over the sky and the earth!
	Thousands of songs and ten thousand melodies,
	Every note is sung for Chairman Mao!
	The soldiers sing more loyally: The earth may crumble and the heavens may fall, but our resolve will not waver!
	We will follow Chairman Mao closely,
	And swear to plant the red flag all over the world!
