In the face of the great victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, good news has come from the oil industry: the Dushanzi Refinery in Xinjiang successfully produced high-quality No. 1 petroleum coke directly on the delayed coking unit and obtained complete experimental data. This marks a new level in China's refining technology and once again demonstrates that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a powerful driving force for the development of productive forces in our country. This is a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought.

High-quality No. 1 petroleum coke is a crucial raw material for producing graphite electrodes. Graphite electrodes are widely used in the production of high-purity non-ferrous metals, plastics, paper-making, and other industries. This type of coke was previously only produced on batch coking units, with outdated production methods and low efficiency.

The delayed coking method can better and faster convert petroleum residue into gasoline, diesel, and coke. This production process has a high startup rate and long continuous operation time. However, the coke produced by this method has low quality. There are many technical difficulties to overcome to produce high-quality No. 1 petroleum coke using this method.

However, no difficulty can stop the Chinese working class armed with Mao Zedong Thought. The revolutionary workers of the delayed coking department at the Dushanzi Refinery, following Chairman Mao's teachings on "The Chinese people have the spirit, have the ability, and will definitely catch up with and surpass the world's advanced level in the not-too-distant future," have focused on class struggle, carried out revolutionary criticism, and fiercely criticized the black goods advocated by China's Khrushchev, such as slave mentality and crawling philosophy. They broke away from superstition, liberated their minds, and successfully produced high-quality No. 1 petroleum coke in just eight months.

Throughout the entire process of trial production of high-quality No. 1 petroleum coke, the struggle between the two classes, the two lines, and the two roads was always present. Before the large-scale trial production, small-scale experiments were conducted. At that time, due to a handful of capitalist roaders and a few reactionary technical "authorities" within the factory who did not believe in the masses and were detached from reality, hundreds of experiments failed. The revolutionary workers of the delayed coking department actively applied Mao Zedong Thought, using the failures of the capitalist roaders and reactionary technical "authorities" as negative examples. They did not rely on subjective imagination or dead books but conducted extensive investigations and research based on the actual situation and needs of the factory, understanding the properties of the raw oil and the laws of coking. They combined revolutionary spirit with practical spirit, boldly proposing a plan to conduct trials and production simultaneously on large-scale equipment.

At this time, a few reactionary technical "authorities" were waiting to see the "joke." The revolutionary workers understood from this that this production struggle was also a class struggle. They remembered Chairman Mao's teachings on "grasp revolution, promote production" and were determined to bring about production through revolution. At that time, the workers in the workshop were still divided into two factions and had not united. The People's Liberation Army stationed at the factory helped them organize study classes, criticize and repudiate selfishness and revisionism, making them deeply understand that there is no fundamental conflict of interest within the working class. They should follow Chairman Mao's latest instructions to achieve great unity on the principle of revolution and jointly promote revolution and production. They quickly achieved revolutionary great unity and rapidly implemented the revolutionary three-in-one combination, establishing the workshop revolutionary committee.

The members of the workshop revolutionary committee remembered Chairman Mao's teachings on "never forget class struggle" and, during the trial process, conducted living class education for revolutionary workers in conjunction with the actual class struggle in the factory, making revolutionary workers see more clearly that China's Khrushchev's counter-revolutionary revisionist line of managing enterprises is a big stumbling block to the development of productive forces. This aroused the revolutionary workers' deep hatred for China's Khrushchev and their boundless love for the great leader Chairman Mao. Everyone, full of revolutionary enthusiasm, threw themselves into the battle to produce high-quality No. 1 petroleum coke. The members of the revolutionary committee also followed Chairman Mao's teachings on maintaining close ties with the masses, going down to the teams, and working with the workers. When encountering difficulties, they first grasped the active application of Mao Zedong Thought and then led the masses to overcome one technical difficulty after another.

In September of last year, the delayed coking unit was finally completed in the storm of class struggle. The revolutionary workers, with deep class feelings for Chairman Mao, chose the National Day, a day of great significance, to test the equipment. At that time, a handful of capitalist roaders in the factory maliciously said that "there are still many difficulties," attempting to disperse the revolutionary workers' fighting spirit and sabotage the test run. The revolutionary workers of the delayed coking department promptly exposed these villains' tricks, engaged in face-to-face struggles with them, smashed their plots, and finally, on October 1st, produced the first batch of high-quality No. 1 petroleum coke on the delayed coking unit, reporting the good news to Chairman Mao from thousands of miles away.

The news of successfully producing high-quality No. 1 petroleum coke using the delayed coking method quickly spread to Beijing. The Ministry of Petroleum Industry entrusted the delayed coking department of the Dushanzi Refinery with the task of producing high-quality petroleum coke as soon as possible to improve the quality of paper used to print the "Selected Works of Mao Zedong." The revolutionary workers, full of passion and enthusiasm, redoubled their efforts. They said, "Being able to contribute to the publication of revolutionary classics is the greatest happiness for us oil workers." They raised the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, fully implemented Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and achieved even greater victories.

    无产阶级文化大革命是我国生产力发展的强大推动力
    独山子炼油厂狠抓阶级斗争以革命带生产
    在延迟焦化装置上试生产优质石油焦成功
    本报讯　在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的大好形势下，我国石油工业战线传来振奋人心的消息：新疆独山子炼油厂在延迟焦化装置上，直接试生产优质一号石油焦成功，并取得了完整的实验数据。这标志着我国的炼油技术又达到了一个新的水平，再一次显示了无产阶级文化大革命是使我国社会生产力发展的一个强大的推动力。这是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。
    优质一号石油焦，是制造石墨电极的重要原料。石墨电极广泛地用于生产高纯度有色金属、塑料、造纸等工业。这种焦炭，过去只能在釜式焦化装置上生产，生产方法落后，生产效率低。
    延迟焦化的方法，可使石油残渣更好更快地转化为汽油、柴油以及焦炭。这种生产工艺，开工率高，连续运转的时间长。但是用这种方法生产出来的焦炭，质量低。要想用这种方法生产优质一号石油焦，在技术上有很多困难需要克服。
    但是，什么困难也难不倒用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国工人阶级。独山子炼油厂的延迟焦化部门的革命职工，遵照毛主席关于“中国人民有志气，有能力，一定要在不远的将来，赶上和超过世界先进水平”的伟大教导，狠抓阶级斗争，开展革命大批判，狠批了中国赫鲁晓夫鼓吹的奴隶主义、爬行哲学等黑货。他们破除迷信，解放思想，仅仅用八个月就成功地试生产出了优质一号石油焦。
    优质一号石油焦试生产的整个过程，始终贯穿着两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争。在未进行大装置试生产前，曾经搞过小型试验。当时，由于厂内一小撮走资派和少数资产阶级反动技术“权威”，不相信群众，脱离实际，上百次的试验都失败了。延迟焦化部门的革命职工，活学活用毛泽东思想，把走资派和反动技术“权威”的失败事实作为反面教材。他们既不凭主观想象，也不凭死的书本，而是从本厂的实际情况和需要出发，进行了广泛的调查研究，了解了原料油性质和焦化规律。他们把革命气概和实际精神结合起来，大胆地提出了在大装置上边试验边生产的方案。
    这时，少数资产阶级技术“权威”，又在等着看“笑话”。革命职工从这里懂得：这一场生产斗争，同时也是一场阶级斗争。他们牢记毛主席关于“抓革命，促生产”的教导，决心以搞好革命来带动生产。当时，车间里的工人还是两派，没有联合起来。驻厂人民解放军帮助他们大办学习班，斗私批修，使他们深刻认识到，在工人阶级内部没有根本的利害冲突，应当遵照毛主席的最新指示，在革命的原则上实现大联合，齐心协力地抓革命促生产。他们很快实现了革命的大联合，又迅速实现了革命的三结合，成立了车间革命委员会。
    车间革委会的成员牢记毛主席关于“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的教导，在试验过程中，结合本厂的阶级斗争实际，向革命职工进行了活的阶级教育，使革命职工更加看清了中国赫鲁晓夫推行的反革命修正主义办企业路线，是阻碍生产力发展的大绊脚石。这样，就激起了革命职工对中国赫鲁晓夫的无比仇恨，对伟大领袖毛主席的无限热爱。大家满怀革命豪情投入了试生产优质一号石油焦的战斗。革委会成员还遵照毛主席要密切联系群众的教导，下到班组，和工人一块劳动。遇到困难，他们首先抓活学活用毛泽东思想，然后领导群众，克服一个又一个技术难关。
    去年九月，延迟焦化装置终于在阶级斗争的暴风雨中胜利落成了。革命职工怀着对毛主席的深厚阶级感情，选择了国庆节这个具有伟大意义的日子试车。当时厂内一小撮走资派却胡说什么“困难还很多”，妄图涣散革命职工的斗志，破坏试车工作的进行。延迟焦化部门的革命职工及时识破了这些家伙的鬼主意，同他们展开了面对面的斗争，粉碎了他们的阴谋，终于在十月一日，在延迟焦化装置上，生产出了第一塔优质一号石油焦炭，从数千里外向毛主席报喜。
    用延迟焦化方法试生产优质一号石油焦成功的消息，很快传到了北京。石油工业部把尽快生产优质石油焦、以提高印刷《毛泽东选集》用纸质量的任务，交给了独山子炼油厂延迟焦化部门。革命职工满怀激情，干劲倍增。他们说，“能为出版革命宝书出一把力，是我们石油工人的最大幸福。”他们更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，全面落实毛主席一系列最新指示，夺取更大的胜利。
