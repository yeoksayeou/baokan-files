	NEW DELHI, July 29 (Xinhua) — According to a report from the Oriental News Agency, about 1,200 workers, peasants, and students from various prefectures in the Kanto region of Japan, who have long been at the forefront of the struggle against U.S. military bases, held rallies on July 27 and 28 in front of the U.S. military training ground in North Fuji, Yamanashi Prefecture. They expressed their determination to carry the struggle against U.S. military bases and to shatter the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" to the end.

	The July 28 rally was attended by farmers from Ninnokomura, who have been tenaciously fighting for the removal of the U.S. military training ground in North Fuji for over 20 years, representatives of farmers from Sunagawa, Tokyo, who have been blocking the expansion of the U.S. Air Force base for 13 years, and representatives of farmers from Sanrizuka, Chiba Prefecture, who have been fighting against the construction of the "New Tokyo International Airport."

	About 100 Tokyo youth and students formed a contingent, carrying a large red banner with the words "Long Live Mao Zedong Thought" and participated in the rally.

	That day, it rained heavily. The participants were soaked to the skin, but their hearts burned with hatred as they faced the U.S. military training ground.

	Leaders of the North Fuji Farmers' Movement, Tonomi Tomi, and leaders of the North Fuji Women's Action Squad, Watanabe Kimie, Sunagawa Farmers' Movement leader Miyokawa Masao, and Sanrizuka Farmers' Movement leader Koyama Kazuo, as well as Japanese Socialist Party Diet member Iga Daiti and famous female commentator Matsuoka Yoichi, spoke at the meeting. They all expressed their determination to continue the struggle against the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries and to drive U.S. imperialism out of Japan completely.

	They also pointed out that the struggle to remove U.S. military bases and abolish the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" that has swept across Japan has dealt a heavy blow to U.S. imperialism's aggression in Vietnam. They called on as many people as possible to unite all those who oppose U.S. imperialism and the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" to jointly carry out the struggle. Some speakers also condemned the treacherous actions of the Japanese Communist Party's revisionist group led by Kyuemon in betraying the Japanese people's anti-American struggle.

	After the meeting, the participants demonstrated in front of the U.S. military training ground. They gave enthusiastic encouragement to the farmers who have been struggling in the sheds set up inside the U.S. military base for more than a year. The demonstrators shouted slogans in front of the sheds, such as "Yankees, get out of Japan!" "Down with the reactionary Sato government!" "We will persist in the struggle with the spirit of 'Moving Mountains with Persistent Effort'!" "Long Live the Invincible Mao Zedong Thought!"

    日本人民决心把反美斗争进行到底
    关东地区工人农民学生冒雨在美军演习场前集会示威
    东京青年和学生高举“毛泽东思想万岁”红旗参加集会
    新华社二十九日讯　据东方通讯社报道：一直站在反对美国军事基地斗争前列的日本关东地区各县工人、农民和学生约一千二百人，二十七日和二十八日在山梨县北富士美军演习场前举行集会，表示要把反对美国军事基地和粉碎日美“安全条约”的斗争进行到最后胜利。
    参加二十八日集会的，有二十多年来一直顽强地为要求撤除美军北富士演习场而斗争的忍野村的农民，有十三年来一直阻止扩大美国空军基地的东京砂川农民代表，以及为反对修建“新东京国际机场”而坚持斗争的千叶县三里塚农民代表。
    大约一百名东京青年和学生组成的一支队伍，高举着上面写有“毛泽东思想万岁”字样的大红旗，参加了集会。
    这天，大雨倾盆。参加集会的人浑身湿透，但是他们面对着美军演习场，心中燃烧着仇恨的烈火。
    北富士农民运动领导人天野茂美、北富士妇女行动队领导人渡边喜美江、砂川农民运动领导人宫冈政雄和三里塚农民运动领导人户村一作，以及日本社会党国会议员井冈大治和著名的女评论家松冈洋子在会上讲了话。他们在讲话中一致表示要继续同美日反动派进行针锋相对的斗争，把美帝国主义全部彻底地赶出日本。
    他们还指出，日本全国各地掀起的为撤除美国军事基地和废除日美“安全条约”的斗争，已经给予美帝侵越战争以沉重的打击。他们呼吁尽可能广泛地团结一切反对美帝、反对日美“安全条约”的人共同进行斗争。有的人在讲话中还谴责了日共宫本修正主义集团背叛日本人民反美斗争的罪恶行径。
    会后，与会者到美军演习场举行示威。他们对在美国军事基地场地内搭起棚屋坚持斗争达一年多的农民给予热情的鼓励。示威者在棚屋前面振臂高呼“美国佬，从日本滚出去！”“打倒佐藤反动政府！”“我们将以‘愚公移山’的精神坚持斗争到底！”“战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！”等口号。
