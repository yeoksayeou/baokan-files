Revolution liberates productive forces. Chairman Mao teaches us: "Revolution is the liberation of productive forces, revolution is the promotion of the development of productive forces."

The China Clock Factory is an ordinary medium-sized factory in Shanghai. During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, this factory underwent profound changes. In this factory, Mao Zedong Thought has taken deep root; the sustained and in-depth revolutionary criticism and struggle is cleansing the muddy waters of the revisionism of the Chinese Khrushchev; the entire factory is full of vigor and vitality, presenting a completely new revolutionary scene. The average daily output of clocks has increased by nearly half compared to the past. In the eighteen months since the establishment of the revolutionary committee, the factory has exceeded the state plan by a large margin every month.

The most noticeable and prominent change in this factory is in the painting workshop. The changes in the painting workshop are a microcosm of the profound changes in the entire factory, and at the same time, they have promoted the leap in production in other workshops. The painting workshop is responsible for painting clock cases. In the past, it was always operated manually, and the technology was very backward. The volatile toxic substance benzene in the paint was released into the air, affecting the health of the workers, and production could not be increased. Therefore, this workshop became the key to the factory's production increase.

Before the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the revolutionary workers of the painting workshop had proposed many good suggestions to solve the problem of benzene poisoning. However, the capitalist roaders in the factory, implementing the revisionist line of managing enterprises advocated by the Chinese Khrushchev, said things like "the workshop is small, the conditions are poor, and the problem cannot be solved," and suppressed these suggestions one by one. The higher-level company, in order to solve the difficulties of this workshop, had also conducted investigations in the factory, concluding that: "expanding the workshop and equipment is currently difficult to solve, but according to the existing conditions, the production can be appropriately reduced." This would reduce the annual output of clock cases by two-thirds compared to the original. The workers heard that the output would be reduced by two-thirds and firmly refused. To maintain production, the capitalist roaders in the factory resorted to "material incentives," providing nutritional meals for the workers, and later adding a bottle of milk per person per day, but the problem was still not fundamentally solved.

Where is the root cause of benzene poisoning? During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the workers of this workshop raised this sharp question. They followed Chairman Mao's teaching to "criticize the bourgeoisie" and, starting from April last year, launched a stormy wave of revolutionary criticism and struggle, focusing on criticizing the revisionist line of managing enterprises advocated by the Chinese Khrushchev. Through the revolutionary criticism and struggle, the workers increasingly saw clearly: the root cause of benzene poisoning lay with the Chinese Khrushchev. The workers angrily pointed out: it was this Chinese Khrushchev and his agents who, with their revisionist line of managing enterprises, shackled the workers' hands and feet, stifled the workers' creative talents. Take technological innovation as an example. The capitalist roaders in this factory, according to the revisionist line of the Chinese Khrushchev, stipulated that each technological innovation must go through seven approvals. These seven approvals actually became the "ghost gate" that stifled the technological innovation movement. A painter had long wanted to develop a new piece of equipment, but as soon as the suggestion was made, he was asked to fill out a "Technological Innovation Form," which listed items such as "innovation idea," "innovation effect," "innovation budget," and so on. The worker saw this laughable form and felt he couldn't fill it out. Then he thought, even if he filled out the form, it was unknown when he could pass through these seven approvals, so he had to put it down and not do it. The more the workers criticized, the more indignant they became. They said: "The revisionist goods of control, restriction, and oppression advocated by the Chinese Khrushchev are shackles that bind the socialist enthusiasm of the workers. We must smash them to pieces!"

Then, the workers launched a fierce criticism of the "material incentives" advocated by the Chinese Khrushchev. The workers pointed out sharply: "In the past, the capitalist roaders gave each person a bottle of milk every day, which was the black goods of 'material incentives' peddled by the Chinese Khrushchev. It could not solve the problem of benzene poisoning at all, and instead, it would cause spiritual poisoning and corrupt our workers' souls." All the revolutionary workers in the workshop voluntarily canceled the regulation of drinking milk during the criticism and struggle, and proudly declared: "We want to be good workers of Chairman Mao and will never be the captives of 'material incentives.' We will rely on the invincible Mao Zedong Thought to carry out technological innovation and thoroughly solve the problem of benzene poisoning."

The newly born revolutionary committee of this factory actively supported the workers' suggestions and decided to thoroughly solve the problem of benzene poisoning together with the workers. They said: "This is not only to break through the production bottleneck of the entire factory, but first of all, it is to politically criticize and condemn the revisionist line of the Chinese Khrushchev and defend Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line."

With unprecedented revolutionary enthusiasm, the workers threw themselves into the battle to solve the problem of benzene poisoning. At the same time, the entire factory, based on the in-depth development of revolutionary criticism and struggle, implemented streamlining and efficiency, and technical personnel went down to the workshops to work with the workers, carrying out technological innovation. In less than three months, they developed an electrostatic spray painting machine and a dip painting machine, changing the painting process from manual operation to mechanical operation. Not only did the production efficiency increase by one and a half times, but it also solved the problem of workers' skin directly contacting the paint.

After the electrostatic spray painting machine and dip painting machine were successfully developed, if the paint formula was not changed, the benzene content in the air could not be reduced. The workers in this workshop seriously studied Chairman Mao's teaching that "human beings must constantly summarize experience, make discoveries, inventions, and creations, and make progress." They opposed "crawling" and decided to press on with the victory and start experimenting with new coatings.

This factory had previously experimented with new coatings. However, at that time, the capitalist roaders in the factory believed in the bourgeois "experts" and "authorities" and did not believe in workers with practical experience. As a result, the coatings developed were not in line with the actual production. This time, the workers, technical personnel, and revolutionary cadres formed a "three-in-one" team to carry out the experiment. They actively learned and applied Mao Zedong Thought, broke away from superstition, and blazed their own trail. After more than one hundred experiments, they finally successfully developed an ideal new coating. After large-scale use in March, the benzene concentration in the air was reduced to only one percent of the original, thoroughly solving the long-standing problem of benzene poisoning and also providing valuable experience for other similar factories to solve this problem.

Revolution promoted the rapid development of production. With the solution of the benzene poisoning problem, the output of clock cases in the workshop increased significantly, meeting the production needs of other workshops in the entire factory. Recently, a type of wall clock exported by this factory, due to the use of new coatings, has a higher gloss on the shell and has been unanimously praised by foreign friends. The workers said: "With Mao Zedong Thought as our weapon, we can overcome all difficulties."

    革命解放了生产力
    毛主席教导我们：“革命就是解放生产力，革命就是促进生产力的发展。”
    中国钟厂是上海一家普通的中型工厂。在无产阶级文化大革命中，这个工厂发生了深刻的变化。在这个厂里，毛泽东思想深入人心；持久深入的革命大批判，正在荡涤着中国赫鲁晓夫修正主义的污泥浊水；全厂朝气蓬勃，出现了从来没有的崭新的革命景象。钟的平均日产量，也比过去增加了将近一半。厂革委会成立的十八个月来，月月大幅度地超额完成了国家计划。
    这个厂的变化最明显、最突出的是漆工车间。漆工车间的变化是全厂深刻变化的缩影，同时也推动了其他车间生产的跃进。漆工车间是专门漆钟壳的。过去一直用手工操作，技术很落后。漆中含有的挥发性的有毒物质苯，散发在空气里，影响工人的健康，生产一直上不去。因此，这个车间就成为影响全厂生产上升的关键。
    漆工车间革命职工为了改变车间面貌，在无产阶级文化大革命以前，曾经多次提出过许多解决苯中毒问题的好建议。但是，厂内走资派推行中国赫鲁晓夫的修正主义办企业路线，说什么“厂房小，条件差，无法解决”，把这些建议一一扼杀。上级公司为了解决这个车间的难题，也曾经到工厂做过调查，结论是：“扩大厂房设备目前难以解决，可根据现有条件，相应地减少生产。”这样，就要使钟壳年产量比原来降低三分之二。工人们一听要减少三分之二的产量，坚决不答应。为了维持生产，厂里走资派使出了“物质刺激”的手段，给工人发营养菜，以后又每人每天增发一瓶牛奶，但问题仍然没有得到根本解决。
    苯中毒的毒根究竟在那里？无产阶级文化大革命中，这个车间的工人提出这样一个尖锐的问题。他们按照毛主席“要批判资产阶级”的教导，从去年四月份起，掀起了疾风暴雨般的革命大批判高潮，集中力量批判了中国赫鲁晓夫的修正主义办企业路线。通过革命大批判，工人们越来越清楚地看出：苯中毒的总毒根，就在中国赫鲁晓夫身上。工人们愤怒地指出：就是这个中国赫鲁晓夫和他的代理人，用修正主义的办企业路线束缚了工人的手脚，扼杀了工人的创造才能。就拿技术革新来说，本厂的走资派根据中国赫鲁晓夫的修正主义路线，规定每项技术革新要经过七道关口。这七道关口实际上成了扼杀技术革新运动的“鬼门关”。有一个漆工很早就想搞一项新设备，谁知这个建议一提出，就要他填《技术革新表》，表上列有什么“革新设想”、“革新效果”、“革新预算”等等项目。这个工人看到这张令人哭笑不得的表格，觉得没法填，再一想，就是填好了表，这七道关口也不知何年何月通得过，只好搁下不干了。工人们越批判越气愤，他们说：“中国赫鲁晓夫的那一套管、卡、压的反革命修正主义货色，是束缚工人社会主义积极性的枷锁，我们非把它彻底砸烂不可！”
    接着，工人们又狠狠批判了中国赫鲁晓夫推行的“物质刺激”。工人们尖锐地指出：“过去走资派每天给每人发一瓶牛奶，就是贩卖的中国赫鲁晓夫的‘物质刺激’的黑货，它根本不能解决苯中毒的问题，相反会引起思想中毒，腐蚀我们工人的灵魂。”全车间革命工人在大批判中主动取消了吃牛奶的规定，并且豪迈地提出：“我们要做毛主席的好工人，决不做‘物质刺激’的俘虏。我们要依靠战无不胜的毛泽东思想大搞技术革新，彻底解决苯中毒的问题。”
    这个工厂的新生的革命委员会，积极支持工人的建议，下决心和工人们一起，彻底解决苯中毒的问题。他们说：“这不仅仅是为了突破全厂的生产关键，首先是为了从政治上批臭中国赫鲁晓夫的修正主义路线，捍卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。”
    工人们以从来没有的革命激情，投入了解决苯中毒问题的战斗。同时，由于全厂在深入开展革命大批判的基础上，实行了精兵简政，技术人员纷纷下车间和工人结合在一起，搞技术革新，不到三个月，就制成了静电喷漆机和淋漆机，使涂漆由手工操作改为机械操作，不但生产效率提高了一倍半，而且还解决了工人皮肤直接接触漆的难题。
    静电喷漆机和淋漆机试制成功以后，漆的配方如果不改变，空气中的含苯量还是不能减少。这个车间的工人们，认真学习了毛主席“人类总得不断地总结经验，有所发现，有所发明，有所创造，有所前进”的教导，大反“爬行主义”，决定乘胜前进，动手试验新的涂料。
    这家工厂过去也曾经试验过新涂料。但是，那时厂内走资派迷信资产阶级的“专家”、“权威”，不相信有实践经验的工人，结果试制出来的涂料都不切合生产实际。而这一次，工人们和技术人员、革命干部一起，组成“三结合”的班子进行试验，他们活学活用毛泽东思想，破除迷信，走自己的路，经过一百多次试验，终于试验成功了一种理想的新涂料，三月份大规模使用后，空气中的含苯浓度降低到只相当于原有的百分之一，彻底解决了苯中毒这个老大难的问题，同时，也为其他同类型工厂提供了解决这个问题的宝贵经验。
    革命带动了生产的突飞猛进。由于苯中毒问题的解决，车间的钟壳产量大幅度上升，满足了全厂其他车间生产的需要。最近这个厂出口的一种挂钟，由于使用了新涂料，外壳的光亮度更高了，受到了外国朋友的一致称赞。工人们说：“有了毛泽东思想武装，我们就能战胜一切。”
