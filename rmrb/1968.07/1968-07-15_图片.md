The Revolutionary Committee of the Liaoyuan Coal Mine in Jilin Province has led revolutionary workers in deeply carrying out revolutionary criticism. They have severely criticized the "exploitation is meritorious" theory advocated by China's Khrushchev, greatly raising the class consciousness and awareness of two-line struggle among the workers. They have resolved to carry forward the Party's style of closely linking with the masses and, together with revolutionary workers, use Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to firmly grasp class struggle and hold and use power for the proletariat.
