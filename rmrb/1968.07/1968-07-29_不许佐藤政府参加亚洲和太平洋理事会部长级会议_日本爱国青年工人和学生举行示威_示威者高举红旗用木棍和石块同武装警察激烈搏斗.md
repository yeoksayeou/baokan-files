Japanese patriotic youth, workers, and students hold a demonstration

Demonstrators wave red flags and fight armed police with sticks and stones

	New China News Agency, July 28th: According to a report from the Orient News Agency, on the 27th, Japanese patriotic youth, workers, and students held a demonstration and march to protest the Sato reactionary government's dispatch of Foreign Minister Miki Takeo to attend the ministerial meeting of the Asia and Pacific Council scheduled to begin on the 30th in Canberra. This meeting is being held under the manipulation of American imperialism, and the representatives of various puppet governments in Asia are participating.

	The Sato reactionary government, fearing the just actions of the youth, workers, and students, issued an order on the 26th to prohibit gatherings and demonstrations near Haneda Airport. On the 27th, the day Miki Takeo was to depart, the Sato government deployed more than twenty armored vehicles and mobilized three thousand armed police. They set up checkpoints on all bridges leading to the airport and erected barricades, blocking all traffic.

	In the afternoon of the 27th, about three hundred brave Japanese youth, workers, and students resolutely protested Miki Takeo's participation in the Canberra meeting and blocked his departure. They waved red flags and used sticks and stones to engage in fierce combat with the armed police guarding the bridges leading to the airport. They shouted slogans such as "Smash the Asia and Pacific Council" and "Break the Japan-U.S. 'Security Treaty'." More than a thousand citizens supported and encouraged the just actions of the youth and students. The armed police brutally suppressed the demonstrators and unjustly arrested twenty patriotic students. Under the strict protection of many armed police and armored vehicles, Miki slipped into the airport and departed for Canberra. The Sato reactionary government also brutally suppressed students gathered at the front of Tokyo's Shinjuku Station, preparing to go to Haneda Airport to protest, and unjustly arrested thirty-seven students. The Sato reactionary government's brutal suppression of Japanese youth, workers, and students has sparked strong opposition from the broad masses of the Japanese people, who unanimously protest the reactionary policies of the Sato government serving American imperialism.

    佐藤反动政府由于害怕青年工人和学生的正义活动，二十六日就下令禁止在羽田机场附近举行集会和示威。在二十七日三木武夫启程的这一天，佐藤政府开出二十多辆装甲车，动员了三千名武装警察，在通往机场的所有桥梁上设置了警戒线，并设置路障，封锁一切交通。
    二十七日下午，英勇的日本青年工人和学生约三百人，坚决抗议三木武夫参加堪培拉的会议并阻止三木动身。他们高举红旗，用木棍和石块同在通往机场的桥上守卫的武装警察展开了激烈的搏斗。他们高呼“砸烂亚洲和太平洋理事会”、“粉碎日美‘安全条约’”等口号。一千多市民群众支持、鼓励青年和学生的正义行动。武装警察对示威青年和学生进行野蛮镇压，并无理逮捕了二十个爱国学生。三木在许多武装警察和装甲车的森严保护下，溜进机场启程去堪培拉。佐藤反动政府还残暴镇压聚集在东京新宿车站前面准备去羽田机场进行抗议的学生，无理逮捕学生三十七人。佐藤反动政府野蛮镇压日本青年工人和学生的罪行，引起日本广大人民的强烈反对，他们一致抗议佐藤政府为美帝国主义效劳的反动政策。（附图片）
