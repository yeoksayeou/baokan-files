The mountains are cheering, the seas are laughing. Our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao has issued his latest instructions on carrying the proletarian educational revolution through to the end. This latest instruction is like a lighthouse, once again pointing the way for our ongoing educational revolution. Upon hearing this great news, our Beijing Agricultural University has erupted in excitement. Over three thousand teachers and students solemnly pledge to Chairman Mao: We will, with the greatest determination and the fastest speed, fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions.

Our great leader Chairman Mao has always taught us that intellectuals must unite with the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers. However, the Chinese Khrushchov and his agents at the university have repeatedly and frenziedly opposed Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. They have insisted on running the agricultural university in a distant city, far removed from the peasant masses and agricultural production, in grand buildings, and they dare to call it the "highest institution of agricultural learning"! On our proletarian platform, the bourgeois reactionary "authorities" protected by the Chinese Khrushchov and his agents at the university have been spreading poison, peddling the black goods of feudalism, capitalism, and revisionism. They talk about cultivating "agronomists" and "horticulturists," about how the "Department of Agricultural Economics is for training managers of state-owned farms," and even blatantly claim that "studying agricultural machinery is to supervise the labor of agricultural machinery operators in the future." They shamelessly peddle the reactionary fallacy of the exploiting classes, "those who labor with their minds rule, those who labor with their strength are ruled," attempting to corrupt the youth into becoming bourgeois "spiritual aristocrats" who are detached from workers and peasants, read books to become officials, and pursue fame and wealth.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Proletarian politics must take command," "We should develop the students morally, intellectually, and physically, and turn them into cultured workers with socialist consciousness." However, the Chinese Khrushchov and his agents at the university brazenly oppose Chairman Mao's great instructions. They wield the "vulgarization" and "simplification" stick, fiercely opposing the masses' study of Chairman Mao's works, opposing the prominence of proletarian politics, and pushing for "one thesis, two foreign languages, three foundations (mathematics, physics, chemistry), four aspects (ancient, modern, Chinese, foreign)." On one hand, they put the "intellectual first" and "grades first" tightrope on the youth's heads, and on the other hand, they elevate the bourgeois reactionary "authorities" to "red professors," urging the youth to emulate them, making some people spend their days "studying dead books and chasing grades," while knowing nothing about production practice, not distinguishing between rice, millet, and sorghum, and even less between enemies, friends, and ourselves. In this way, many have strayed onto the bourgeois "white specialist" path.

The Chinese Khrushchov has been trying every means to turn our socialist schools into fortresses for his capitalist restoration, striving to cultivate the younger generation into bourgeois successors who despise workers and peasants and are detached from productive labor, to achieve their evil goal of restoring capitalism. Especially in recent years, the Chinese Khrushchov has directly extended his black hands into our university, vigorously promoting the "two educational systems" junk, attempting to turn our school into an "experimental field" for his counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line. The heinous crimes committed by the Chinese Khrushchov against our university must be thoroughly settled.

In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we have held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, launching a revolutionary criticism of the Chinese Khrushchov and his agents in our school, and closely combining the revolutionary criticism with the cleansing of class ranks, heavily striking down the class enemy's rightist reversal wind, thoroughly smashing the bourgeois intellectuals' rule over our school, and further consolidating the proletarian revolutionary faction's leadership over the educational cause in politics, organization, and ideology.

Chairman Mao! Through the practice of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution over the past two years, we have come to understand more deeply that "the countryside is a vast world where one can achieve great things," and the poor and lower-middle peasants are the masters of agricultural science. Under your wise leadership, we are full of confidence and will definitely carry the proletarian educational revolution through to the end. We will further run various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, earnestly implement your latest instructions, closely follow the majestic steps of hundreds of millions of revolutionary people, and resolutely move the agricultural university to the countryside, back to the five hundred million peasants. We are determined, in the fiery class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experiment of the three great revolutionary movements, to brave the storms and gain experience, roll in the mud, forge a red heart, and forever be good successors of the poor and lower-middle peasants!

    滚一身泥巴，炼一颗红心
    北京农业大学革命委员会
    山在欢呼，海在欢笑。我们最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席，发出了关于把无产阶级教育革命进行到底的最新指示。这一最新指示象灯塔一样，为我们正在进行的教育革命又一次指明了航向。我们北京农业大学听到这个特大喜讯，校园里立刻沸腾起来了。全校三千多名师生庄严地向毛主席宣誓：一定以最大的决心，最快的速度，全面落实毛主席的最新指示。
    知识分子必须和广大工农兵相结合，这是我们伟大领袖毛主席的一贯教导。可是，中国赫鲁晓夫及其在农大的代理人却一次又一次地疯狂对抗毛主席的革命路线，硬把农业大学办在远远脱离农民群众，脱离农业生产的大城市的洋楼里，还美其名曰：“农业的最高学府”！在我们的无产阶级的讲台上，中国赫鲁晓夫及其在农大的代理人包庇下的资产阶级反动“权威”，大肆放毒，极力兜售封、资、修的黑货，他们大谈什么培养“农学家”、“园艺家”呀，什么“农经系是培养国营农场场长的”呀，甚至公然胡说什么
  “学了农机课是为了以后监督农机手的劳动”，明目张胆地贩卖“劳心者治人，劳力者治于人”的反动的剥削阶级谬论，妄图把青年腐蚀成脱离工农，“读书做官”，追逐名利的资产阶级
  “精神贵族”。
    毛主席教导我们：“要无产阶级政治挂帅”，
  “应该使受教育者在德育、智育、体育几方面都得到发展，成为有社会主义觉悟的有文化的劳动者。”而中国赫鲁晓夫及其在农大的代理人，肆无忌惮地对抗毛主席的伟大指示，抡起“庸俗化”、“简单化”的大棒，猖狂反对群众学习毛主席著作，反对突出无产阶级政治，大搞什么“一篇论文，两门外语，三门基础（数、理、化）、四个方面（古、今、中、外）”。他们一方面用这个
  “智育第一”、“分数挂帅”的紧箍咒套在青年头上，一方面又把资产阶级反动“权威”封为“红色教授”，要青年去仿效，使一些人整天“死读书，追分数”，而对生产实践则一窍不通，分不清稻、谷、黍，更分不清敌、我、友。就这样，使不少人步入了资产阶级“白专道路”的歧途。
    中国赫鲁晓夫就是这样千方百计地企图把我们社会主义的学校，变成他复辟资本主义的顽固堡垒，竭力把青年一代培养成轻视工农，脱离生产劳动的资产阶级接班人，以实现他们复辟资本主义的罪恶目的。特别是近几年，中国赫鲁晓夫直接把他的黑手伸进农大，竭力推行“两种教育制度”的破烂货，妄图把我校变成他的反革命修正主义教育路线的“试验田”。中国赫鲁晓夫对我们农大犯下的滔天大罪，必须彻底清算。
    在无产阶级文化大革命中，我们高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，对中国赫鲁晓夫及其在我校的代理人，展开了革命的大批判，并紧密结合革命大批判，清理阶级队伍，沉重地打击了阶级敌人刮起的右倾翻案妖风，彻底地摧毁了资产阶级知识分子对我们学校的统治，从政治上、组织上、思想上进一步巩固了无产阶级革命派对教育事业的领导权。
    毛主席呀，毛主席！通过两年来无产阶级文化大革命的实践，我们越发懂得了“农村是一个广阔的天地，在那里是可以大有作为的”，广大贫下中农是农业科学的主人。在您的英明领导下，我们信心百倍，一定要把无产阶级教育革命进行到底。我们要进一步办好各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，认真落实您的最新指示，紧紧跟上亿万革命人民前进的雄伟步伐，坚决把农业大学搬到农村去，回到五亿农民中去，当一辈子普通农民。我们决心在火热的阶级斗争、生产斗争和科学实验三大革命运动中，经风雨，见世面，滚一身泥巴，炼一颗红心，永远做贫下中农的好后代！
