Recently, the surging revolutionary student movement in Latin America has been like a stormy sea, surging and powerful, fiercely striking at the reactionary rule of U.S. imperialism and its lackeys, turning the "backyard" of the United States into the frontline of anti-U.S. struggle. This is another manifestation of the excellent situation of the world revolution.

Students in Brazil, Chile, Argentina, Bolivia, Uruguay, Peru, Venezuela, Ecuador, and Colombia have been fiercely opposing imperialism, opposing the reactionaries of their respective countries, and opposing the old educational system. The roars of "Down with U.S. imperialism!" and "Down with pro-U.S. dictatorships!" have echoed across Latin America, shaking the very ground. The young students, fearless of violence, use stones, sticks, and glass bottles as weapons to fight bravely against the reactionary police and military. They attack the U.S. embassies, burn the U.S. flags, and burn effigies of dictators. They direct their spears at the vicious enemy of the Latin American people, U.S. imperialism, and its agents in their own countries. This fully demonstrates the new awakening of the Latin American people, their intense hatred for neo-colonialism, and the growing strength of the revolutionary forces in Latin America.

The students of Latin America have done well, very well! Their struggle has greatly boosted the morale of the revolutionary people and greatly dampened the arrogance of U.S. imperialism and all reactionaries. We, the Red Guards of China, resolutely support the revolutionary actions of the Latin American students and pledge to be their strong backing!

For a long time, the people of various countries in Latin America have suffered from the oppression and trampling of U.S. imperialism and its lackeys, enduring the pain of cruel political oppression and economic exploitation. The colonial rule of U.S. imperialism is the root of the suffering of the Latin American people. To completely rid themselves of the reactionary rule of U.S. imperialism and its lackeys, the revolutionary people must raise high the banner of "It is justified to rebel against the reactionaries" and rise up in revolution and rebellion! Only thus can they overthrow the U.S. imperialism that has been riding on the backs of the Latin American people for so long; only thus can they completely overthrow the reactionary rule of the pro-U.S. dictatorial regimes and get rid of their status of being oppressed and enslaved; only thus can they achieve the complete liberation of the people!

Facing the burgeoning revolutionary student movement, U.S. imperialism and its lackeys hate it to death and fear it to death. Thus, while playing political tricks, they hurriedly send out large batches of police and military to carry out bloody suppression. However, the young students of Latin America, with their glorious revolutionary tradition, are fearless. They are willing to sacrifice their lives and shed their blood for the sake of liberation. What are batons and bayonets, water cannons, and tear gas? "All reactionaries are paper tigers. In appearance, the reactionaries are terrifying, but in reality, they are not so powerful. All the same, the people do not want to have anything to do with them. The people have seen through them; the people have no fear of them. The people have dug them up by the roots. All that is left is for the people to destroy them completely, drive them out, and throw them into the garbage heap of history—this is the logic of the development of things and the logic of revolution." The deeper the oppression, the more intense the resistance. The revolutionary students of various countries in Latin America have not been intimidated by the aggressive posture of U.S. imperialism and its lackeys. They are unyielding and fight tenaciously in the face of counter-revolutionary suppression.

Modern revisionists are trembling with fear in the face of the revolutionary student movement. They collude with U.S. imperialism in every possible way, trying to extinguish the flames of the revolutionary student struggle. This once again exposes their treacherous faces and, at the same time, further exposes their paper tiger's weak essence.

Combining with the struggles of the working class and peasants is the fundamental direction of the student movement. Currently, the student movement in Latin America is receiving strong support from the broad masses of the people. Young students can only play their vanguard role better and strike more powerfully at the U.S. and its lackeys by uniting with the workers and peasants to achieve victory.

We, the Red Guards who are infinitely loyal to the great leader Chairman Mao, are determined to unite closely with the revolutionary people and students of Latin America, to unite closely with the people of the whole world, and to launch a sustained and fierce attack on our common enemy, U.S. imperialism and its accomplices!

Our great teacher Chairman Mao said: "The student movement is a part of the entire people's movement. The upsurge of the student movement inevitably promotes the upsurge of the entire people's movement." The torrent of the revolutionary student movement in Latin America is unstoppable. A more intense revolutionary storm will inevitably sweep across the entire Latin America. The days of U.S. imperialism and its lackeys, who have done so much evil, will not be long. The final victory will surely belong to the revolutionary people of Latin America!

    坚决支持拉丁美洲学生的革命行动
    红宣兵
    最近以来，拉丁美洲掀起的轰轰烈烈的革命学生运动，象大海的怒涛，汹涌澎湃，猛烈地冲击着美帝国主义及其走狗的反动统治，把美国的“后院”变成了反美斗争的前线。这是世界革命形势大好的又一个表现。
    巴西、智利、阿根廷、玻利维亚、乌拉圭、秘鲁、委内瑞拉、厄瓜多尔和哥伦比亚等国家的青年学生们大造帝国主义的反，大造各国反动派的反，大造旧教育制度的反。“打倒美帝国主义”、“打倒亲美独裁统治”的怒吼声响彻了拉丁美洲的上空，震撼了拉丁美洲的大地。青年学生们不畏强暴，用石块、木棍、玻璃瓶等作为武器，同反动军警进行英勇的搏斗，袭击美国大使馆，焚烧美国星条旗，焚烧独裁者的模拟像，他们把矛头直接指向拉丁美洲人民的凶恶敌人美帝国主义及其在本国的代理人。这就充分显示了拉丁美洲人民的新觉醒，显示了他们对于新殖民主义的无比仇恨，显示了拉丁美洲人民革命力量的日益壮大。
    拉丁美洲的学生们干得好，好得很！他们的斗争大长了革命人民的志气，大灭了美帝国主义和一切反动派的威风。我们中国的红卫兵，坚决地支持拉丁美洲学生的革命行动，誓作他们的坚强后盾！
    长期以来，拉丁美洲各国人民受尽了美帝国主义及其走狗的欺凌和蹂躏，饱尝了它们残酷的政治压迫和经济剥削的痛苦。美帝国主义的殖民主义统治是拉丁美洲人民苦难的根源。要彻底摆脱美帝国主义及其走狗的反动统治，革命人民就必须高举起“对反动派造反有理”的大旗，起来革命造反！非如此，不能打倒长期骑在拉丁美洲人民头上的美帝国主义；非如此，不能彻底推翻亲美独裁政权的反动统治，摆脱被压迫、被奴役的地位；非如此，不能获得人民的彻底解放！
    面对着蓬勃发展的革命学生运动，美帝国主义及其走狗恨得要死，怕得要命。于是，在玩弄政治欺骗的同时，又慌忙派出大批军警进行血腥镇压。但是，具有光荣革命传统的拉丁美洲青年学生是无所畏惧的。他们为了争取解放，抛头颅，洒热血，在所不辞。警棍和刺刀，水龙和催泪弹，又算得了什么？“一切反动派的企图是想用屠杀的办法消灭革命，他们以为杀人越多革命就会越小。但是和这种反动的主观愿望相反，事实是反动派杀人越多，革命的力量就越大，反动派就越接近于灭亡。这是一条不可抗拒的法则。”压迫愈深，反抗愈烈。拉丁美洲各国的革命学生并没有被美帝国主义及其走狗的气势汹汹所吓倒，他们在反革命的镇压面前不屈不挠，顽强战斗。
    现代修正主义者在革命学生运动面前胆颤心惊。他们和美帝国主义狼狈为奸，千方百计地妄图扑灭革命学生斗争的烈火。这就再一次暴露了他们的叛徒的丑恶嘴脸，同时，也进一步暴露了他们的纸老虎的虚弱本质。
    同工农群众的斗争相结合，是学生运动的根本方向。目前拉丁美洲学生运动正在受到广大人民的有力支持。青年学生也只有同工农结合在一起，才能更好地发挥自己的先锋作用，才能更有力地打击美帝及其走狗，取得胜利。
    我们无限忠于伟大领袖毛主席的红卫兵，决心同拉丁美洲革命人民和革命学生紧密地团结起来，同全世界人民紧密地团结起来，向着我们的共同敌人美帝国主义及其帮凶们发动持久的猛烈的进攻！
    我们的伟大导师毛主席说：“学生运动是整个人民运动的一部分。学生运动的高涨，不可避免地要促进整个人民运动的高涨。”拉丁美洲革命学生运动的洪流是不可阻挡的。一场更激烈的革命风暴必将席卷整个拉丁美洲。做尽了坏事的美帝国主义及其走狗的寿命不会很长了。最后的胜利必定属于拉丁美洲的革命人民！
