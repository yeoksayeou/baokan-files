Revolutionary Committees Must Deeply Root Themselves Among the Masses

Revolutionary committees represent the fundamental interests of the people. The people are the foundation of the revolutionary committees and the source of the power of the proletarian dictatorship. Revolutionary committees must deeply root themselves among the masses. Members of revolutionary committees at all levels must further seriously study Chairman Mao's brilliant thoughts on the mass line and the mass viewpoint, and firmly establish a thoroughgoing mass viewpoint. They must raise the question of how to deal with the masses to the level of world outlook and to the level of whether one is loyal or disloyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. They must always stand at the forefront of the masses, actively guide the masses, boldly lead the movement, and at all times bring the mass movement onto the track of Mao Zedong Thought.

Chairman Mao has recently pointed out profoundly: "Whether to protect or suppress the broad masses of the people is the fundamental difference between the Communist Party and the Kuomintang, the fundamental difference between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, and the fundamental difference between the dictatorship of the proletariat and the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie."

To protect the people, one must correctly handle the relationship with the people and actively accept criticism and supervision from the masses. Regarding opinions from the masses, one must look at the essence, the main trend, and the general direction. One must humbly accept criticism and supervision from the people, adhere to the truth, and correct mistakes. One must strictly distinguish between the two types of contradictions and actively help the revolutionary masses of the proletariat correctly handle internal differences, lead the broad revolutionary masses, firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, and always direct the spearhead of the struggle at a handful of class enemies.

To deeply root themselves among the masses, revolutionary committees must maintain the broadest, most frequent, and closest contact with the broad masses of the people. "The masses are the real heroes, while we ourselves are often childish and ridiculous, not realizing this, one cannot obtain even the most elementary knowledge." The process of revolutionary committee members rooting themselves among the masses is the process of learning from the masses, the process of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought together with the masses, and the process of continuously summarizing the practical experience of the masses' struggle, consolidating and developing the revolutionary committees. Members of revolutionary committees at all levels must be highly vigilant against the onslaught of bourgeois sugar-coated bullets. Even if one's position changes, one's feelings of being connected with the masses by flesh and blood must not change; even if one's duties change, one's style of maintaining contact with the masses must not change. One must always maintain the character of a laboring people, genuinely place oneself among the masses, honestly learn from the masses, and be willing to be a small student of the masses. Everything must be done from the fundamental interests of the people, and one must resolutely act according to the principles of proletarian party spirit, thoroughly criticize and overcome all kinds of bourgeois thoughts that are divorced from the masses, such as individualism, factionalism, cliquism, sectarianism, and bureaucratism.

    革命委员会要深深扎根于群众之中
    革命委员会是代表人民群众的根本利益的，人民群众是革命委员会的基础，是无产阶级政权力量的源泉。革命委员会要深深地扎根于群众之中，各级革命委员会的成员，就要进一步认真学习毛主席关于群众观点、群众路线的光辉思想，牢固地树立彻底的群众观点。要把对待群众的问题提高到世界观的高度，提高到忠不忠于毛主席无产阶级革命路线的高度来认识。要始终站在群众的前头，积极引导群众，大胆指导运动，随时把群众运动纳入毛泽东思想的轨道。
    毛主席最近深刻地指出：“对广大人民群众是保护还是镇压，是共产党同国民党的根本区别，是无产阶级同资产阶级的根本区别，是无产阶级专政同资产阶级专政的根本区别。”
    保护人民群众，就要正确地对待人民群众，主动地接受群众的批评和监督。对于来自群众中的意见，要看本质、看主流、看大方向。虚心接受人民群众的批评和监督，坚持真理，修正错误。要严格区分两类不同性质的矛盾，积极帮助无产阶级革命派正确处理内部的分歧，率领广大革命群众，紧紧掌握斗争大方向，始终把斗争的矛头指向一小撮阶级敌人。
    革命委员会要深深地扎根于群众之中，就必须和广大人民群众保持最广泛的、经常的、密切的联系。“群众是真正的英雄，而我们自己则往往是幼稚可笑的，不了解这一点，就不能得到起码的知识。”革命委员会成员扎根于群众中的过程，就是向群众学习的过程，就是同群众一道活学活用毛泽东思想的过程，就是不断总结群众斗争的实践经验，巩固和发展革命委员会的过程。各级革命委员会的成员，都要十分警惕资产阶级糖衣炮弹的袭击。地位变了，与群众血肉相连的感情不能变；职务变了，联系群众的作风不能变。要始终保持劳动人民的本色，切实置身于群众之中，老老实实向群众学习，甘当群众的小学生。一切都要从人民群众的根本利益出发，坚决按无产阶级的党性原则办事，彻底批判和克服个人主义、山头主义、小团体主义、宗派主义、官僚主义等形形色色脱离群众的资产阶级思想。
