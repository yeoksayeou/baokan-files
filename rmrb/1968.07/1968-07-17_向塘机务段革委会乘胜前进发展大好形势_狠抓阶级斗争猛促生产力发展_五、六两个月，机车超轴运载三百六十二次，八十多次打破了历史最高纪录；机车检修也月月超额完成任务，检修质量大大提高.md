The Xiantang Locomotive Depot Revolutionary Committee of the Nanchang Railway Bureau is advancing amidst a favorable situation, intensifying class struggle, and deeply developing the revolutionary criticism movement to further promote the development of productive forces. In May and June, locomotives exceeded the axle load 362 times, breaking the historical highest record more than 80 times; locomotive repairs also exceeded the quota every month, with repair quality significantly improved.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, July 16th: After the birth of the Xiantang Locomotive Depot Revolutionary Committee in April this year, revolutionary masses were jubilant and production enthusiasm was high. However, a wind of anarchism blew through the repair workshop. Some people in this workshop arbitrarily left their production posts and went fishing. Following this, production accidents occurred frequently, and production volume plummeted.

Members of the depot's Revolutionary Committee, remembering Chairman Mao's teaching "Never forget class struggle," immediately realized that there was enemy activity in the fishing wind. They then mobilized the masses to root out the class enemy elements that incited this perverse wind. Through this serious class struggle, the committee members deeply realized: The establishment of the Revolutionary Committee does not mean that everything will be peaceful from now on. As a command center for class struggle, the Revolutionary Committee must maintain a clear mind in favorable situations, intensify class struggle, and lead the masses to actively launch attacks on class enemies. Only in this way can the newly established Revolutionary Committee be consolidated, and the favorable situation of revolution and production further developed.

Members of the Xiantang Locomotive Depot Revolutionary Committee realized through struggle practice that to thoroughly liberate productive forces, it is necessary to deeply develop the revolutionary criticism movement and smash the shackles of revisionism that bind the workers' hands.

The modification of the "anti-revisionist" coal-feeding machine is a good example. Previously, this imported coal-feeding machine would malfunction as soon as it was used, needing repairs daily. Every day, a long queue of coal-feeding machines waiting for repairs formed. What to do? The workers, following Chairman Mao's teaching "To destroy is to establish. Destruction is criticism, is revolution. Destruction means to reason, and reasoning is establishment. Destruction comes first, and establishment is within it," launched a revolutionary criticism movement. Everyone took up the thousand-jin hammer of Mao Zedong Thought, thoroughly criticizing and exposing the revisionist "technical leadership" and "expert path." They established the "coal-feeding machine modification group" and, in the absence of engineering and technical personnel, fully mobilized the workers' enthusiasm. After more than a month of repeated experiments, they finally successfully modified the coal-feeding machine.

Through the revolutionary criticism movement, the ideological appearance of the broad masses of workers underwent tremendous changes. They remembered Chairman Mao's teachings and appeared before people with a new fighting posture. The repair workshop, under the impetus of the revolutionary criticism movement, saw a high tide of technological innovation. The entire workshop had more than 40 large and small innovation projects, and just the fast-flushing device alone increased work efficiency by more than 100 times.

Revolution liberated productive forces. Especially after our great leader Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin Biao received the representatives attending the National Railway and Transportation Conference, the broad revolutionary cadres and workers burst with sky-high revolutionary enthusiasm. Each locomotive crew conducted experiments, striving to pull more and faster. The new driver Fu Yongde's crew tried to exceed the axle load, but the first attempt failed. The Revolutionary Committee, following the great leader Chairman Mao's teaching "Trust the masses, rely on the masses, respect the masses' pioneering spirit," enthusiastically supported them and studied Chairman Mao's works with them, analyzed the reasons for failure, and encouraged them to continue experimenting. Under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought and with the strong support of the Revolutionary Committee, Fu Yongde's crew finally achieved a starting speed of 70 kilometers per hour, pulling 3,020 tons, exceeding the axle load by 802 tons, creating the highest record at that time for the Xiantang Locomotive Depot.

    向塘机务段革委会乘胜前进发展大好形势
    狠抓阶级斗争猛促生产力发展
    五、六两个月，机车超轴运载三百六十二次，八十多次打破了历史最高纪录；机车检修也月月超额完成任务，检修质量大大提高
    据新华社南昌十六日电　南昌铁路局向塘机务段革命委员会，在大好形势下，狠抓阶级斗争，深入开展革命大批判，进一步促进生产力的发展。五、六两个月，机车超轴运载三百六十二次，八十多次打破了历史最高纪录；机车检修也月月超额完成任务，检修质量大大提高。
    今年四月间，向塘机务段革委会胜利诞生后，革命群众欢欣鼓舞，生产热情很高。可是，在检修车间却刮起了一股无政府主义妖风。这个车间的一些人擅自离开生产岗位，拿起钓鱼竿就去钓鱼了。接踵而来的是，生产事故不断出现，产量骤然下降。
    这个段的革委会成员，牢记毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的教导，立即意识到，钓鱼风里有敌情。于是，他们就放手发动群众，把煽动这股歪风的阶级异己分子揪了出来。通过这场严肃的阶级斗争，革委会成员深刻地认识到：革委会的成立，并不意味着从此就天下太平了。作为阶级斗争战斗指挥部的革命委员会，必须在大好形势下，保持清醒的头脑，狠抓阶级斗争，带领广大群众主动地向阶级敌人发起进攻，这样才能不断巩固新生的革委会，进一步发展革命、生产的大好形势。
    向塘机务段革委会成员在斗争实践中认识到，要使生产力得到彻底解放，就必须深入开展革命大批判，把束缚工人手脚的修正主义的枷锁砸烂。
      “反修”型加煤机的改造就是一个很好的例证。以前，这种从外国进口的加煤机，一使用就出故障，天天修，天天坏，每天等着修理的加煤机排成了长队。怎么办？工人群众遵照毛主席“不破不立。破，就是批判，就是革命。破，就要讲道理，讲道理就是立，破字当头，立也就在其中了”的教导，开展了革命大批判，人人奋起毛泽东思想的千钧棒，把修正主义的“技术挂帅”“专家路线”彻底批倒批臭。他们成立了“加煤机改造小组”，在没有工程技术人员的情况下，充分发挥工人的积极性，经过一个多月的反复试验，终于把加煤机改造成功。
    通过革命大批判，广大工人的思想面貌发生了巨大变化，他们牢记毛主席的教导，以崭新的战斗姿态出现在人们的面前。检修车间在革命大批判的带动下，出现了技术革新的高潮。全车间大小革新项目达四十多项，仅快速冲洗装置一项，就提高工效上百倍。
    革命解放了生产力。尤其是在我们伟大领袖毛主席和林彪副主席接见了出席全国铁路、交通会议的代表以后，广大革命职工更加迸发出冲天的革命干劲，各个机班纷纷搞试验，争取多拉快跑。新司机傅永德机班的同志试验超轴，第一次没有成功。革委会同志遵循伟大领袖毛主席“要信任群众，依靠群众，尊重群众的首创精神”的教导，热情支持他们，并和他们一起学习毛主席著作，分析失败的原因，鼓励他们继续试验。在毛泽东思想光辉指引下，在革委会的大力支持下，傅永德机班终于以每小时七十公里的起速，牵引三千零二吨，超轴八百零二吨，创造了当时向塘机务段的历史最高纪录。
