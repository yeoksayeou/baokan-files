The long-term brutal colonial rule imposed by American imperialism on Puerto Rico has sparked growing dissatisfaction and resistance among the Puerto Rican people.

On July 18th, Puerto Rican patriots, fueled by deep hatred towards the U.S., bombed three American-owned stores in the bustling downtown area of the capital, San Juan. One of the stores was completely destroyed by the fire caused by the explosion. According to reports, the three attacks resulted in a loss of fifty million dollars for the American capitalists.
