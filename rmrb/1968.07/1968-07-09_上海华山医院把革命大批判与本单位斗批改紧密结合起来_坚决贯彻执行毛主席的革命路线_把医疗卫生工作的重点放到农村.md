Shanghai Huashan Hospital combines revolutionary criticism with local struggle, criticism, and transformation, resolutely implementing Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and shifting the focus of medical and health work to the countryside.

A Xinhua News Agency Shanghai July 6th dispatch: The revolutionary cadres and revolutionary masses of Shanghai First Medical College Huashan Hospital, following the great leader Chairman Mao's instruction to "shift the focus of medical and health work to the countryside," and following Chairman Mao's series of great teachings on medical and health work, have combined the revolutionary criticism with the local struggle, criticism, and transformation. They have thoroughly criticized the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of the Chinese Khrushchev, firmly established Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and achieved significant results in the revolutionization of medical and health work. Nearly one-third of the medical staff of this hospital are often in the countryside directly serving the poor and lower-middle peasants.

In the storm of the "January Revolution," the revolutionary cadres and revolutionary masses of Huashan Hospital won the struggle to seize power from a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party and established the revolutionary committee in April last year. After the establishment of the revolutionary committee, they led the revolutionary masses to continue the deep and sustained revolutionary criticism, to clean up the class ranks, and to launch a fierce attack on a handful of class enemies, uncovering a batch of hidden traitors, spies, and other counter-revolutionaries. In the intense class struggle, they combined revolutionary criticism with the local struggle, criticism, and transformation, greatly enhancing the class consciousness and two-line struggle consciousness of the revolutionary staff, promoting their ideological revolutionization, and thus bringing about the revolutionization of medical and health work.

First, solve the fundamental issue of who to serve

The issue of who medical and health work serves is the focal point of the struggle between the two classes, two lines, and two roads in the medical and health sector. Great leader Chairman Mao pointed out more than twenty years ago: "The peasants—this is the main object of the cultural movement in the present stage of China. The so-called elimination of illiteracy, the so-called popularization of education, the so-called mass art, the so-called national health, without the 360 million peasants, would these not become mostly empty talk?" The handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party of this hospital had previously crazily pushed the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of the Chinese Khrushchev, opposing Chairman Mao's instructions, and always focused medical and health work on big cities, serving a small number of people. However, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants lacked medical care and medicines, and when they fell ill, they could not receive timely treatment. Some poor and lower-middle peasants traveled thousands of miles to seek medical treatment here, but the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party of the hospital used economic and regulatory means to obstruct them in every possible way, making it impossible for the poor and lower-middle peasants to register or be admitted to the hospital. The handful of capitalist-roaders and the reactionary academic "authorities" of the bourgeoisie also put a large amount of manpower and material resources into researching so-called "high, difficult, and profound" diseases, while for the common and frequently occurring diseases of the working people, they did not research or rarely researched how to prevent and treat them, or how to improve treatment. In response to this situation, the revolutionary staff of Huashan Hospital launched a vigorous revolutionary criticism. Everyone denounced the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents for pushing the counter-revolutionary revisionist line in the medical and health sector. Some comrades who had just returned from a medical tour in the mountainous rural areas used examples of the lack of medical care in the countryside to denounce the heinous crimes of the Chinese Khrushchev in pushing the counter-revolutionary revisionist line and to discuss the great significance of Chairman Mao's instruction to "shift the focus of medical and health work to the countryside." Many comrades deeply felt that the great leader Chairman Mao is most concerned about the health of the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and working people. What attitude to take towards the health of the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and the health of the broad masses of working people is, in the final analysis, a question of attitude towards Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Many medical staff from working-class families in the entire hospital used their parents' or siblings' tragic experiences of dying from illness due to lack of money for treatment in the old society to denounce the evil deeds of the reactionary ruling class, fiercely criticize the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of the Chinese Khrushchev, and thus aroused everyone's deep proletarian feelings for the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, strengthened their hatred for the Chinese Khrushchev, and further established the idea of serving the poor and lower-middle peasants.

On the basis of raising the consciousness of the broad masses, the hospital revolutionary committee combined revolutionary criticism with two aspects of reform. On the one hand, they changed the previous overly detailed division of departments and work, separating medical, nursing, and worker work, and combined medical, nursing, and patient life management work, requiring medical and nursing staff to be versatile. In the past year, they have achieved significant results in this regard. Many nurses now know how to diagnose, prescribe, and operate, and many doctors have also put down their airs and learned nursing work. At the same time, they actively reformed the old examination and treatment methods. The old set of numerous examination methods was completely unsuitable for the countryside. Many examinations and tests were not necessary for treatment but were for the bourgeois academic "authorities" to accumulate so-called "research" materials. Cumbersome examinations not only increased the economic burden on patients but also caused patients unnecessary pain. Now, medical staff only conduct examinations and tests based on the need for treatment. On the other hand, the hospital specially established a "Revolutionary Clinic" for treating the poor and lower-middle peasants. Here, poor and lower-middle peasants can see a doctor as soon as they arrive, and the procedures for registration, consultation, treatment, payment, and medication are simplified. Internal, surgical, neurological, and dermatological diseases can all be treated at the same time. Some convenient oral medications and inexpensive, effective medications are preferentially supplied to the poor and lower-middle peasants. They also, based on the condition, preferentially arrange for the poor and lower-middle peasants to be hospitalized. The hospital has put a large amount of manpower and material resources into how to prevent and treat the common and frequently occurring diseases of the working people.

Break the "expert" line and establish the mass line

Is it to rely on a few bourgeois academic "authorities" to run the hospital, or is it to rely on the broad revolutionary masses to run the hospital? Is it to follow the "expert" line or the mass line? This is the fundamental question of which road medical and health work will take. In the past, the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party of the hospital colluded with the reactionary academic "authorities" of the bourgeoisie to run the hospital, handing over the power to manage the hospital and departments to them. The so-called "hospital affairs committee" that controlled the power of the entire hospital was composed of reactionary academic "authorities" of the bourgeoisie and representatives of bourgeois intellectuals, with not a single revolutionary worker or revolutionary young medical staff representative. The handful of capitalist-roaders and the reactionary academic "authorities" of the bourgeoisie also used their power to expel revolutionary young medical staff who dared to rebel against them. The handful of capitalist-roaders not only greatly promoted those reactionary academic "authorities" of the bourgeoisie but also did everything possible to bring them into the Party. The Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in the health sector also formulated various rules and a whole set of revisionist systems to consolidate the rule of bourgeois intellectuals over the hospital.

After the proletarian revolutionary cadres took power, following Chairman Mao's teaching, "Without destruction, there can be no construction. Destruction is criticism, is revolution. Destruction must be based on reason. Reason is construction. Destruction comes first, and construction is within it," they carried out in-depth and sustained revolutionary criticism, breaking all the old frameworks that did not benefit the working people, and the revolutionary enthusiasm of the masses soared to an unprecedented height. In the past, doctors in the Radiology Department could only read X-ray films and diagnose diseases but could not take X-rays; technicians could only take X-rays but could not read films or diagnose diseases. Now, the revolutionary medical staff armed with Mao Zedong Thought have fully displayed their revolutionary enthusiasm. They learn from each other, and both doctors and technicians can take X-rays, read films, and diagnose diseases. Many nurses can now see outpatients, and some nurses can perform appendectomy and hernia surgeries. A few nurses can even perform brain surgery. In the Neurosurgery Department, a nurse of worker origin, through actual work practice, has mastered the brain tumor resection surgery that in the past only doctors with specialized training and longer work experience could perform. The revolutionary practice of this hospital has once again proven that the proletarian revolutionary cadres armed with Mao Zedong Thought are not only good at destroying an old world but also good at building a new world.

A great revolution to break private interests and establish public interests

Implementing the great instruction of the great leader Chairman Mao to "shift the focus of medical and health work to the countryside" is a great revolution to break private interests and establish public interests in the depths of the soul for every revolutionary medical worker. To help everyone do a good job in ideological revolutionization, the hospital revolutionary committee held extensive Mao Zedong Thought study classes, leading the revolutionary masses of the entire hospital to criticize and repudiate revisionism, and raise the consciousness of the two-line struggle. Through extensive study and criticism, Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, Chairman Mao's series of great instructions and related teachings on medical and health work have been deeply rooted in people's hearts. "All those intellectuals who can go to the countryside to work should be happy to go there. The countryside is a vast world, where one can achieve great things." "What is work? Work is struggle. Those places with difficulties and problems need us to solve them. We go to work and struggle to solve difficulties. The more difficult the place, the more we should go, this is what a good comrade should do." Chairman Mao's great teachings, as well as the shining examples of Comrade Norman Bethune and Comrade Mei Hao, have greatly inspired the fighting spirit of the revolutionary medical staff. They said: "We proletarian revolutionary cadres will firmly defend and resolutely implement Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and the policies for medical work formulated by Chairman Mao. To serve the poor and lower-middle peasants for life is our aspiration; to defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line is our greatest happiness!"

This hospital has a surgeon who graduated from the medical college in 1956 and was assigned to Huashan Hospital. From a school dominated by the bourgeoisie to a hospital dominated by the bourgeoisie, he nurtured bourgeois ideas of pursuing fame and wealth. However, when he initially armed himself with Mao Zedong Thought in the struggle between the two lines and went down to the countryside to integrate with the poor and lower-middle peasants, he increasingly felt that Chairman Mao's instructions were extremely wise and correct, and he decided to serve the poor and lower-middle peasants for life. After participating in the medical team to go to the mountainous areas of Anhui, he himself suffered from liver disease but still endured the pain to treat the poor and lower-middle peasants. Comrades advised him to rest, but he always said: "I'm fine, the patient is important." Such moving examples are now quite common in this hospital.

Now, the revolutionary comrades of the entire hospital are further carrying out revolutionary criticism, seriously studying Chairman Mao's series of brilliant instructions on medical work and the struggle against the enemy, determined to grasp the class struggle, carry the struggle between the two lines in medical work to the end, and achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

    上海华山医院把革命大批判与本单位斗批改紧密结合起来
    坚决贯彻执行毛主席的革命路线
    把医疗卫生工作的重点放到农村
    新华社上海六日电　上海第一医学院华山医院无产阶级革命派和革命群众，遵循伟大领袖毛主席“把医疗卫生工作的重点放到农村去”的伟大指示，遵循毛主席关于医疗卫生工作的一系列伟大教导，把开展革命大批判与本单位的斗批改结合起来，大破中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义路线，大立毛主席无产阶级革命路线，在实现医疗卫生工作革命化方面取得了很大成绩。这个医院经常有将近三分之一的医务人员在农村直接为贫下中农服务。
    在“一月革命”风暴的推动下，华山医院的无产阶级革命派和革命群众，取得了向党内一小撮走资派夺权斗争的胜利，去年四月建立了院革命委员会。革委会成立后，率领革命群众继续持久而深入地开展革命大批判，清理阶级队伍，向一小撮阶级敌人发动猛烈进攻，挖出了一批隐藏的叛徒、特务和其他反革命分子。在激烈的阶级斗争中，他们把革命大批判同本单位的斗批改紧密结合起来，大大提高了革命职工的阶级觉悟和两条路线斗争觉悟，促进了他们的思想革命化，从而带来了医疗卫生工作的革命化。
    首先解决为谁服务这个根本问题
    医疗卫生工作为谁服务的问题，是医务卫生部门两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争的焦点。伟大领袖毛主席早在二十多年前就指出：“农民——这是现阶段中国文化运动的主要对象。所谓扫除文盲，所谓普及教育，所谓大众文艺，所谓国民卫生，离开了三亿六千万农民，岂非大半成了空话？”这个医院的党内一小撮走资派，过去疯狂地推行中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义路线，对抗毛主席的指示，一直把医疗卫生工作的重点放在大城市，为少数人服务。而广大贫下中农却缺医少药，生了病得不到及时医疗。有的贫下中农千里迢迢来这里求医，医院党内一小撮走资派从经济上、规章制度上，千方百计加以刁难，使贫下中农挂不上号，住不上医院。一小撮走资派和资产阶级反动学术“权威”，还把大量的人力物力放在研究所谓“高、难、深”的疾病上，而对于劳动人民的一些常见病、多发病，却不去研究或很少研究怎样防治，怎样改进治疗。针对这种状况，华山医院革命职工开展了轰轰烈烈的革命大批判，大家口诛笔伐，痛斥中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人在医疗卫生部门推行的反革命修正主义路线。一些刚从山区农村巡回医疗回来的同志，用农村缺医少药的事例，控诉中国赫鲁晓夫推行反革命修正主义路线的滔天罪行，大谈伟大领袖毛主席关于“把医疗卫生工作的重点放到农村去”的指示的伟大意义。许多同志深有体会地说，伟大领袖毛主席最最关心广大贫下中农和劳动人民的健康。对广大贫下中农的健康、对广大劳动人民的健康采取什么态度，归根结底，是对毛主席的革命路线的态度问题。全院许多劳动人民家庭出身的医务人员，以自己父母或兄弟姐妹在旧社会因病无钱治疗而死亡的悲惨遭遇，控诉反动统治阶级的罪恶，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义路线，从而激发了大家对广大贫下中农的深厚的无产阶级感情，增强了对中国赫鲁晓夫的无比仇恨，进一步树立了为贫下中农服务的思想。
    在广大群众提高觉悟的基础上，医院革委会结合革命大批判从两方面进行了改革。一方面，改变了过去分科分工过细，医疗、护理和工人工作分家的局面，把医疗、护理和病人生活管理工作结合起来，要求医护人员一专多能。一年多来，他们在这方面取得了较大成绩。许多护士现在都学会了诊断、处方、开刀等医疗工作，许多医生也放下架子，学会护理工作。同时，他们又积极改革了旧的检查治疗的方法。旧的一套名目繁多的检查方法根本不适合农村。许多检查、化验并非治病所必需，而是为资产阶级学术“权威”积累所谓“研究”资料。繁琐的检查既增加病人的经济负担，又增加病人不必要的痛苦。现在医务人员只根据治病需要，进行检查、化验。另一方面，医院专门设立了为贫下中农治病的“革新门诊”。在这里，贫下中农来看病，随到随看，而且简化了挂号、看病、治疗、收费、取药等手续，内科、外科、神经科、皮肤科的疾病都能一起诊治。一些使用方便的口服药、价廉效高的药品，都优先供应贫下中农。他们还根据病情，优先照顾贫下中农住院。医院把大量的人力、物力，用到了怎样防治劳动人民的常见病、多发病上。
    大破“专家”路线　大立群众路线
    是依靠少数资产阶级学术“权威”办院，还是依靠广大革命群众办院？是走“专家”路线，还是走群众路线？这是决定医疗卫生工作走什么道路的根本问题。过去医院党内一小撮走资派勾结资产阶级反动学术“权威”办院，把管理医院和科室的大权交给他们。掌握全院大权的所谓“院务委员会”里，都是资产阶级反动学术“权威”和资产阶级知识分子的代表人物，根本没有一个革命工人和革命青年医务人员的代表。一小撮走资派和资产阶级反动学术“权威”还利用职权，把敢于造他们的反的革命青年医务人员排挤出医院。一小撮走资派不仅十分重用那些资产阶级反动学术“权威”，而且千方百计把他们拉入党内。中国赫鲁晓夫及其在卫生部门的代理人还制订了种种清规戒律和一整套修正主义制度，以巩固资产阶级知识分子对医院的统治。
    无产阶级革命派掌权以后，遵照毛主席“不破不立。破，就是批判，就是革命。破，就要讲道理，讲道理就是立，破字当头，立也就在其中了”的教导，深入持久地开展革命大批判，把旧的不符合劳动人民利益的条条框框都冲破了，群众的革命积极性空前高涨。放射科的医生过去只会看透视照片，诊断疾病，不会拍片子；而技术员只会拍片子，却不会看片子和诊断疾病。现在，用毛泽东思想武装起来的革命医务人员，充分发挥了革命积极性，他们互相学习，医生和技术员都会拍片子、看片子和诊断疾病。许多护士都能看门诊，不少护士能做割阑尾、疝气等手术，有的护士还能进行脑部开刀手术。神经外科有个工人出身的护士，通过实际工作的锻炼，掌握了过去只有经过专门训练、工作年限较长的医生才能做的脑瘤切除手术。这个医院的革命实践又一次证明：用毛泽东思想武装起来的无产阶级革命派，不但善于破坏一个旧世界，而且善于建设一个新世界。
      一场破私立公的大革命
    贯彻伟大领袖毛主席“把医疗卫生工作的重点放到农村去”的伟大指示，对每个革命的医务工作者来说，是一场在灵魂深处破私立公的大革命。为了帮助大家搞好思想革命化，院革委会大办毛泽东思想学习班，领导全院革命群众斗私批修，提高两条路线斗争的觉悟。通过大学习和大批判，毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，毛主席关于医疗卫生工作的一系列伟大指示和有关教导，已经深入人心。“一切可以到农村中去工作的这样的知识分子，应当高兴地到那里去。农村是一个广阔的天地，在那里是可以大有作为的。”“什么叫工作，工作就是斗争。那些地方有困难、有问题，需要我们去解决。我们是为着解决困难去工作、去斗争的。越是困难的地方越是要去，这才是好同志。”毛主席的这些伟大教导，以及白求恩同志和门合同志的光辉榜样，大大鼓舞了革命医务人员的斗志。他们说：“毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，毛主席制定的卫生工作方针，我们无产阶级革命派坚决捍卫，坚决贯彻执行。为贫下中农服务一辈子，是我们的志愿；捍卫毛主席的革命路线，是我们最大最大的幸福！”
    这个医院有一位外科医生，是一九五六年从医学院毕业后分配到华山医院的。从资产阶级知识分子统治的学校到资产阶级知识分子统治的医院，使他滋长了追求名利的资产阶级思想。但是，当他在两条路线斗争中初步用毛泽东思想武装了自己，并下到农村和贫下中农结合以后，就越来越感到毛主席的指示无比英明、无比正确，下决心为贫下中农服务一辈子。他参加医疗小分队到皖南山区以后，自己患了肝病，照样忍痛为贫下中农治病。同志们劝他休息，他总是说：“我不要紧，病人要紧。”类似这样动人的事例，现在在这个医院是比较多的。
    现在，全院革命同志正在进一步开展革命的大批判，认真学习毛主席有关卫生工作和对敌斗争的一系列光辉指示，决心狠抓阶级斗争，把卫生工作中的两条路线的斗争进行到底，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
