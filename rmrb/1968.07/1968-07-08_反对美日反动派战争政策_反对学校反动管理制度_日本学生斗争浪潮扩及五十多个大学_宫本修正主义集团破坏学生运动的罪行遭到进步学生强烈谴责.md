Japanese students are continuing their struggle against the oppression of the U.S.-Japan reactionaries and against the reactionary administrative system of the school authorities. Currently, students at fifty-four universities and colleges across Japan have joined the fight.

Students' awareness has been heightened through the struggle, and they have seen through the ugly face of the Japanese Communist Party's revisionist clique serving the U.S.-Japan reactionaries. They are now resolutely fighting against these traitors.

Students at Tokyo University have been fighting for over twenty days to protest the school authorities' unreasonable punishments and their collusion with armed police to suppress students. Patriotic students have reoccupied the university's administrative offices and the Yasuda Auditorium. On the 5th, over 3,000 students held a spirited meeting in the Yasuda Auditorium. Speakers on the platform, adorned with many red flags, severely condemned the Sato reactionary government's attempt to continue its reactionary rule over universities and force universities to serve the war policies of the U.S.-Japan reactionaries. The attendees condemned the Japanese Communist Party's revisionist clique for colluding with the U.S.-Japan reactionaries, using every trick and scheme to sabotage the students' just struggle.

Many departments at Tokyo University continue to boycott classes. Students in the Engineering Department, at a meeting, rejected the treacherous "initiative" of the student "self-governing body" controlled by the Japanese Communist Party's revisionist clique, overthrew the student "self-governing body," and elected a "struggle committee" to lead their fight. Students from various departments and classes have passed resolutions, strongly condemning the evil deeds of the Japanese Communist Party's revisionist clique.

Students at Keio University in Tokyo strongly protested the school authorities' use of funds provided by the U.S. military to research biological weapons. On the afternoon of the 5th, 3,000 students held a meeting at the university's Hiyoshi campus. They announced their decision to hold indefinite class boycotts and to continue the struggle until the school authorities issue a statement refusing to accept funds from the U.S. military.

Keio University also had 5,000 students hold a meeting on the same afternoon at the university's Mita campus, severely condemning the school authorities for making the university's research activities serve the U.S. military.

Students at Tokyo University of Education are fighting against the Sato reactionary government's unreasonable interference in the university. The university has a total of five colleges, and currently, students in three of them are boycotting classes. Students in the College of Literature have barricaded the administrative building with desks and chairs, while students in the College of Agriculture have set up barricades and checkpoints at the entrance of the college building using desks and benches.

On the 4th, students at Kitakyushu University in Fukuoka Prefecture held a school-wide class boycott to protest the school authorities' ban on their organizing a mutual aid association.

    反对美日反动派战争政策　反对学校反动管理制度
    日本学生斗争浪潮扩及五十多个大学
    宫本修正主义集团破坏学生运动的罪行遭到进步学生强烈谴责
    据新华社七日讯　据东方通讯社报道：日本大学生反对美日反动派的迫害以及反对学校当局的反动行政管理制度的斗争正在继续发展。目前在日本全国已有五十四个大学院校的学生起来进行斗争。
    学生们的觉悟在斗争中更加提高了，他们识破了日共宫本修正主义集团为美日反动派效劳的丑恶嘴脸，并且同这些叛徒进行坚决的斗争。
    东京大学学生为抗议学校当局对学生的无理惩罚和勾结武装警察镇压学生，已经坚持进行了二十多天的斗争。爱国学生重新占领了这所大学的校部办公室和安田礼堂。五日，有三千多名学生在安田礼堂里举行了斗志昂扬的集会。代表们在悬挂着许多红旗的讲台上讲话时，严厉谴责佐藤反动政府企图继续对大学进行反动统治和迫使大学为美日反动派的战争政策效劳。与会者谴责日共宫本修正主义集团同美日反动派狼狈为奸，耍尽阴谋诡计，破坏学生的正义斗争。
    东京大学许多系的学生继续进行罢课。工程系的学生在一次集会上否决了日共宫本修正主义集团控制的学生“自治会”的叛卖性的“倡议”，推翻了学生“自治会”，选出了“斗争委员会”来领导他们进行斗争。各系和各班的学生纷纷通过决议，强烈谴责日共宫本修正主义集团的罪恶行径。
    东京庆应大学学生强烈抗议学校当局用美军当局提供的资金研究细菌武器。五日下午，三千名学生在这所大学的日吉校园里举行集会。他们在会上宣布决定举行不定期罢课，坚持斗争到学校当局答应发表声明拒绝接受美军当局提供的资金时为止。
    庆应大学另有五千名学生也在同一天下午在这所大学的三田校园举行集会，严厉谴责学校当局使大学的研究活动为美军效劳的罪行。
    东京教育大学学生正在开展反对佐藤反动政府对这所大学进行无理干涉的斗争。这所大学总共有五个学院，目前已有三个学院的学生举行罢课。文学院的学生用桌椅封锁了校部大楼，农学院的学生在学院院部大楼的入口处用桌子和板凳筑起了路障，设立了检查站。
    福冈县北九州大学学生四日举行了全校罢课，抗议学校当局禁止他们组织生活互助会的活动。
