In the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the leadership organs and cadres at all levels of the People's Liberation Army Navy have held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, closely followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, and unswervingly implemented Chairman Mao's proletarian military line and a series of latest instructions. They have fully carried out Vice Chairman Lin Biao's set of policies and principles that emphasize political construction of the army, and have vigorously promoted the revolutionization of the grassroots. They have raised the level of the "Four Good" squad movement to a new height. In the struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines, the leadership organs and party committees at all levels of the Navy have led the troops to vigorously carry out the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, to carry out thorough and sustained revolutionary criticism, and to enhance the troops' class struggle consciousness and awareness of the struggle between the two lines. This has ensured that Chairman Mao's proletarian military line and a series of latest instructions are fully implemented and carried out at the grassroots level. It has cultivated a large number of "Four Good" squads and "Five Good" soldiers who are absolutely loyal to Chairman Mao, absolutely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and absolutely loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. This has accelerated the process of revolutionizing the troops and achieved remarkable results in defending the coastal areas, defending the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and carrying out the "Three Supports, Two Militarys" and other tasks.

Great Leader Chairman Mao has always attached great importance to strengthening the grassroots construction of our army. As early as the initial period of our army's establishment, Chairman Mao pointed out profoundly: "The foundation of the army lies in the soldiers," and stipulated that "the party branch should be established at the squad level." Vice Chairman Lin, creatively applying Mao Zedong Thought and Chairman Mao's military line, summing up the rich experience of our army's construction over the decades, wisely proposed a series of policies and principles that emphasize political construction of the army, such as holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, emphasizing proletarian politics, adhering to the "Four Firsts," promoting the "Three-Eights" style, developing the "Three Democracies," and carrying out the "Four Good" squad movement. He also emphasized that "the root of all work must be planted in the squads, and the grassroots must be grasped seriously," and "the most universal, the largest in quantity, and the most decisive factor is to do a good job in the squads." In the new situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the Navy Party Committee has repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's teachings and Vice Chairman Lin's instructions, deeply realizing that Vice Chairman Lin's "Four Good" squad movement is a brilliant example of creatively applying Chairman Mao's military thought to solve the problem of grassroots construction in our army. In the new situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, whether or not to firmly carry out the "Four Good" squad movement and grasp the revolutionization of the grassroots is a fundamental attitude towards Chairman Mao's military line. It is a major issue concerning whether our army's revolutionary tradition can be passed down from generation to generation and whether our army can successfully complete the political tasks of defending the coastal areas and the "Three Supports, Two Militarys," etc. To adapt to this new situation, while grasping the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in the leadership organs, we must always grasp the "Four Good" squad movement and push it through to the end, raising the revolutionization of the grassroots to a new level.

In the new situation, what is the key to strengthening grassroots construction? According to Chairman Mao's teaching that "mastering ideological education is the key link in uniting the whole party to wage great political struggles," the Navy Party Committee believes that regardless of how the situation and tasks change, studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, emphasizing proletarian politics, and taking strengthening political work as the fundamental link to grasp all work at the grassroots level must never change. In the new historical period of continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat, the struggle between the two classes and the two roads is prominently manifested as the struggle between the two lines within the party. The key link to grasping the revolutionization of the grassroots is to use Chairman Mao's theory, line, policy, and a series of latest instructions on continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat to educate the troops. It is to grasp class struggle and the struggle between the two lines, to raise the troops' awareness of the struggle between the two lines, to plant Chairman Mao's military line at the grassroots level, to cultivate a large number of revolutionary soldiers, combat collectives, and leading cadres who are absolutely loyal to Chairman Mao, absolutely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and absolutely loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. This ensures that the troops can firmly carry out and defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line in any situation, overcome all enemies, and advance to victory.

Under this guidance, since the beginning of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the Navy Party Committee has actively responded to Vice Chairman Lin's call to push the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new stage. It has led the troops to launch a new high tide of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought with the problems of the struggle between the two lines. Subsequently, it has led the troops to carry out a great mass movement of being forever loyal to Chairman Mao, forever loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and forever loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, with Vice Chairman Lin as a brilliant example. After Chairman Mao issued the call to hold extensive study classes, they led the ships and squads to set up various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, repeatedly studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and strengthening education on the struggle between the two lines. The Navy Political Department also held a political work symposium at the beginning of this year, focusing on studying the measures to further implement Chairman Mao's military line and a series of latest instructions at the grassroots level in the new situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. It summarized and exchanged experiences in strengthening grassroots construction, solved new problems posed by the new situation to grassroots construction, and emphasized the need to strengthen grassroots construction by following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and the orders of the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin. They have launched a movement to study Chairman Mao's military line throughout the army. They have led the broad masses of cadres and soldiers to study and apply Mao Zedong Thought with the problems of the struggle between the two lines, actively participating in the struggle between the two lines, using Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, and carrying out sustained and thorough revolutionary criticism against the bourgeois reactionary line of the Chinese Khrushchev and the bourgeois military line of the counter-revolutionary revisionists Peng Dehuai and Luo Ruiqing. Throughout the army, every ship, every squad, every sentry post, and every combat position has integrated revolutionary criticism into the entire process of work. Through revolutionary criticism, the bourgeois reactionary line of the Chinese Khrushchev and the counter-revolutionary revisionists Peng Dehuai and Luo Ruiqing has been thoroughly criticized, Chairman Mao's military line has been firmly established, and the broad masses of cadres and soldiers' class struggle consciousness and awareness of the struggle between the two lines have been greatly enhanced. This has ensured that the troops will always advance to victory along Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Our policy is not only for the leaders to know, for the cadres to know, but also for the broad masses to know." In the process of grasping grassroots construction, the party committees and leading cadres at all levels of the Navy have all gone deep into the grassroots ships and squads to implement face-to-face leadership. To ensure that Chairman Mao's theory, line, policy, and a series of latest instructions on continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat, and Vice Chairman Lin's series of policies and principles that emphasize political construction of the army based on Chairman Mao's military line are implemented at the grassroots level and take root in the minds of cadres and soldiers, military-level units and military-political organs have all organized special teams to grasp grassroots construction. Party committees and military-political organs below the division level have spared no effort to go to the troops to grasp grassroots construction. Many leading cadres, in light of the new situation where the proletarian consciousness of the broad masses of cadres and soldiers has been unprecedentedly heightened since the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, have gone deep into the ships and squads, combining words with deeds, helping grassroots cadres to improve their level of leading the troops with Mao Zedong Thought, and further strengthening the relationship between officers and soldiers. Many division and regiment leadership organs have sent their cadres, except for a few who stay behind for duty, to carry backpacks, follow the ships to sea, stay on the islands, and guide grassroots work. As soon as Chairman Mao issues a new instruction, the leaders at all levels act immediately, race against time, and promptly convey it to the grassroots, ensuring quick transmission, quick study, quick implementation, and quick results. The Party Committee of the 441st Unit, a model unit for studying Chairman Mao's works in the Navy, has taken helping the grassroots implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions as the Party Committee's top priority. The unit's staff often keep more than two-thirds of their time in the troops for specific guidance, studying Chairman Mao's works with the soldiers, criticizing the bourgeoisie, and fighting against selfishness and revisionism together in the troops. In the process of going deep into the grassroots, they have timely summarized various types of experiences, effectively promoting grassroots construction. They have deeply felt that Chairman Mao teaches us: "The masses are the real heroes," which is a great truth. Believing in the masses, relying on the masses, and maintaining close ties with the masses are the prerequisites for doing a good job in grassroots construction. The closer one is to the soldiers, the deeper one's understanding of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line; the closer one is to the soldiers, the tighter one follows Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment; the more one loves the soldiers, the better the troops are led. Zhang Yimin, a model cadre in studying Chairman Mao's works in the Navy, always remembers Chairman Mao's teaching of "being both an 'official' and a commoner," taking going deep into the troops as an important political task, often going deep into the troops, appearing as an ordinary soldier, summarizing advanced experiences with the troops' cadres and soldiers, and quickly promoting them, continuously improving the level of grassroots revolutionization construction.

The party committees and leadership organs at all levels of the Navy, taking Chairman Mao's military line and Vice Chairman Lin's series of policies and principles that emphasize political construction of the army based on Chairman Mao's military line as their guidelines, have grasped grassroots construction, and the revolutionization construction throughout the army has presented a very good situation. The broad masses of cadres and soldiers have received profound education and tempering in the great storms of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and their class struggle consciousness and awareness of the struggle between the two lines have been greatly enhanced. The cadres and soldiers are loyal to Chairman Mao with a single-minded devotion, grasp the use of Mao Zedong Thought, and the advanced soldiers of continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat have rapidly grown and emerged in large numbers. The "Four Good" squad movement has achieved a bumper harvest, and the number of "Five Good" soldiers has increased significantly. The ships and squads that have always been at the forefront of the "Four Good" squad movement, such as the "Sea Pioneer Ship," the "Sea Tiger Ship," the shore battery squad where An Yemin was stationed, the navigation buoy squad of the East China Fleet, the 388th Ship, and many other ships and squads that have been evaluated as "Four Good" for many years, have achieved even greater successes. The ships and squads that were always up and down in the "Four Good" squad movement before 1965, after being educated and tempered by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, have had their awareness of the struggle between the two lines unprecedentedly enhanced and have consecutively won the "Four Good" title. The ships and squads that have never been evaluated as "Four Good" since the launch of the "Four Good" squad movement have, under the impetus of the surging tide of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, mostly entered the ranks of the "Four Good" squads. Many newly emerged advanced "Four Good" ships and squads in the Cultural Revolution, whether in combat against armed enemies or in struggle against unarmed enemies, have all shown the lofty qualities of being absolutely loyal to Chairman Mao, absolutely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and absolutely loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. The great wall of our motherland at sea is more solid, more powerful, and more invincible than ever before.

Currently, the Navy Party Committee, the leadership organs and leading cadres at all levels are, in accordance with Chairman Mao's teaching of "summarizing achievements, correcting errors, and preparing for the next battle," vigorously grasping the preliminary evaluation work of the "Four Good" squads at the grassroots level. They are determined, in the new situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, to raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, emphasize proletarian politics, further strengthen political work at the grassroots level, raise the level of grassroots construction and the "Four Good" squad movement to a new height, and push the revolutionization construction of the troops to a new stage. They will strive to build a powerful people's navy that is absolutely loyal to Chairman Mao, absolutely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and absolutely loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, with Vice Chairman Lin as a brilliant example.

    海军各级党委在无产阶级文化大革命新形势下加速基层革命化建设
    把毛主席的建军路线牢牢扎根在连队
    大力开展活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，落实毛主席的最新指示，贯彻林彪副主席的一整套着重政治建军的方针原则，批臭中国赫鲁晓夫的资产阶级反动路线和反革命修正主义分子彭德怀罗瑞卿的资产阶级军事路线，提高了广大指战员的阶级斗争观念和两条路线斗争觉悟，培养了大批四好连队和五好战士，把祖国的海上长城建设得更加坚强
    新华社四日讯　在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命运动中，人民解放军海军各级领导机关和领导干部，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，坚定不移地贯彻执行毛主席的无产阶级建军路线，和一系列最新指示，全面落实林彪副主席根据毛主席的建军路线提出的一整套着重政治建军的方针原则，狠抓基层革命化建设，把海军的四好连队运动提高到了一个新的水平。在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争中，海军领导机关和各级党委领导部队大力开展活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动，深入持久地开展革命大批判，努力提高指战员的阶级斗争观念和两条路线斗争觉悟，使毛主席的无产阶级建军路线和一系列最新指示，在基层得到了全面贯彻和落实，培养了大批无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于毛泽东思想，无限忠于毛主席革命路线的四好连队和五好战士，加速了部队革命化建设的进程，在保卫海防，保卫无产阶级文化大革命，执行“三支”“两军”和其它各项任务中，连续取得了重大的成绩。
    伟大领袖毛主席历来十分重视加强我军的基层建设。早在我军建军初期，毛主席就深刻地指出：“军队的基础在士兵”，规定要把“支部建在连上”。林副主席创造性地运用毛泽东思想和毛主席的建军路线，总结我军几十年建设的丰富经验，英明地提出了高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，活学活用毛主席著作，突出无产阶级政治，坚持四个第一，大兴三八作风，发扬三大民主，开展四好连队运动等一系列着重政治建军的方针原则，并且着重指出，“一切工作的根子都要扎在连队，要认真地抓连队、抓基层”，“最普遍、最大量、最起决定作用的是把连队搞好”。海军党委在无产阶级文化大革命的新形势下，反复学习了毛主席的教导和林副主席的指示，深深认识到，林副主席提出的四好连队运动，是创造性地运用毛主席军事思想解决我军基层建设问题的光辉典范。在无产阶级文化大革命的新形势下，是不是坚定不移地进一步开展四好连队运动，抓好基层革命化建设，是对毛主席的建军路线的根本态度问题，是关系到我军的革命传统能不能代代相传，关系到我军能不能胜利完成保卫海防和“三支”“两军”等各项政治任务的大问题。要适应这个新形势，就必须在抓好领导机关无产阶级文化大革命的同时，始终把四好连队运动抓住不放，一抓到底，把基层革命化建设推向新的水平。
    在新形势下，加强基层建设主要抓什么？根据毛主席“掌握思想教育，是团结全党进行伟大政治斗争的中心环节”的教导，海军党委认为，不管形势任务千变万化，活学活用毛主席著作，突出无产阶级政治，把加强政治工作当作抓好基层的一切工作的根本环节，永远也不能变。在无产阶级专政下继续革命的新的历史时期，两个阶级，两条道路的斗争，突出地表现为党内两条路线的斗争。抓好基层革命化建设的中心一环，就是要用毛主席关于无产阶级专政下继续革命的理论、路线、方针、政策和一系列最新指示教育部队，狠抓阶级斗争和两条路线斗争教育，提高部队的两条路线斗争觉悟，使毛主席的建军路线在基层扎根，培养大批无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于毛泽东思想，无限忠于毛主席革命路线的革命战士、战斗集体和领导班子，使部队在任何情况下，都能坚定地执行和捍卫毛主席的革命路线，压倒一切敌人，胜利前进。
    在这个思想指导下，海军党委从无产阶级文化大革命一开始，就积极响应林副主席关于把活学活用毛主席著作群众运动推向新阶段的号召，领导部队带着两条路线斗争中的问题，掀起了活学活用毛泽东思想的新高潮。接着，又领导部队深入持久地开展了一个以林副主席为光辉榜样，永远忠于毛主席，永远忠于毛泽东思想，永远忠于毛主席革命路线的伟大群众运动。毛主席发出要大办学习班的号召以后，他们又领导舰艇、连队普遍办起了各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，反复学习毛主席的最新指示，大力加强两条路线斗争教育。海军政治部还在今年初召开了海军政治工作座谈会，着重研究了在基层进一步落实毛主席建军路线和一系列最新指示的措施，总结交流了无产阶级文化大革命新形势下加强基层建设的经验，解决了新形势给基层建设提出的新问题，突出强调要以紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，贯彻落实毛主席的最新指示和以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的号令来加强基层建设。他们在全军全面开展了学习毛主席建军路线的教育运动。他们带领广大指战员，带着两条路线斗争中的问题，活学活用毛泽东思想，积极投入到两条路线斗争中去，以毛泽东思想为武器，深入持久地向中国赫鲁晓夫的资产阶级反动路线和反革命修正主义分子彭德怀、罗瑞卿的资产阶级军事路线，展开了猛烈的进攻。全军上下，每个舰艇、每个连队、每个哨所、每个战位的指战员，都把革命大批判贯串到一切工作的全过程中。通过革命大批判，把中国赫鲁晓夫以及反革命修正主义分子彭德怀、罗瑞卿的资产阶级反动路线批得臭臭的，把毛主席的建军路线立得牢牢的，把广大指战员的阶级斗争观念和两条路线斗争觉悟提得高高的，保证了部队永远沿着毛主席的无产阶级革命路线胜利前进。
    毛主席教导我们：“我们的政策，不光要使领导者知道，干部知道，还要使广大的群众知道。”在狠抓基层建设的过程中，海军各级党委和各级领导干部，纷纷深入基层舰艇和连队，实行面对面的领导。为了使毛主席关于无产阶级专政下继续革命的理论、路线、方针、政策和林副主席根据毛主席的建军路线提出的一系列着重政治建军的方针原则在基层落实，在指战员头脑里扎根，军以上单位和军政机关，都专门组织了狠抓基层建设的工作班子。师以下党委和军政机关，全力以赴，下部队狠抓基层建设。许多领导干部，根据无产阶级文化大革命以来，广大指战员无产阶级觉悟空前提高的新形势，深入舰艇、连队，言传身教，帮助基层干部提高用毛泽东思想带兵的水平，进一步密切了官兵关系。许多师团领导机关的干部，除留少数人在家值班以外，都背上背包，随舰艇出海，到海岛蹲点，指导基层工作。毛主席的每一个最新指示一发表，各级领导就闻风而动，分秒必争，立即传达到基层，做到了传达快，学习快，贯彻快，见效快。海军学习毛主席著作积极分子标兵单位四四一一部队党委，把帮助基层落实毛主席最新指示作为党委压倒一切的中心工作。这个部队的机关干部，经常保持有三分之二以上深入到部队进行具体指导，在部队同战士一起学习毛主席著作，一起批判资产阶级，一起斗私批修。在深入基层中，他们及时总结出了各种类型的经验，有力地推动了基层建设。他们深有体会地说，毛主席教导我们：“群众是真正的英雄”，这是一个伟大的真理。相信群众，依靠群众，密切联系群众，是搞好基层建设的前提。同战士靠得越近，对毛主席的革命路线的理解就越深；同战士越亲，跟毛主席的伟大战略部署就越紧；对战士越爱，部队就越好带。海军学习毛主席著作积极分子、某部政治委员张逸民，牢记毛主席关于“既当‘官’，又当老百姓”的教导，把深入部队当作自己的重要政治任务，经常深入部队，以普通一兵出现，同部队干部战士一起，总结先进经验，迅速加以推广，不断提高了基层革命化建设的水平。
    海军各级党委和领导机关以毛主席建军路线和林副主席根据毛主席建军路线提出的一系列着重政治建军的方针原则为指针，狠抓基层建设，全军上下革命化建设呈现出一片大好形势。广大指战员在无产阶级文化大革命的大风大浪中，受到了深刻的教育和锻炼，阶级斗争观念和两条路线斗争觉悟大大提高。指战员们对毛主席心怀一个“忠”字，对毛泽东思想狠抓一个“用”字，无产阶级专政下继续革命的先进战士迅速成长、大量涌现，创造四好连队运动获得了大面积丰收，五好战士数量大幅度上升。过去一直站在四好连队运动前列的“海上先锋艇”、“海上猛虎艇”、安业民生前所在某岸炮连、东海舰队航标队、三八八舰和许多连年被评为四好的舰艇、连队，获得了更大的成就。一九六五年以前在四好连队运动中一直处于几上几下的舰艇、连队，经过无产阶级文化大革命的教育和锻炼，两条路线斗争觉悟空前提高，接连荣获四好。开展四好连队运动以来始终没有评上四好的舰艇、连队，在无产阶级文化大革命的滚滚洪流推动下，绝大多数跨进了四好连队行列。许多在文化大革命中新涌现的先进的四好舰艇和连队，不管是在同拿枪的敌人的战斗中，还是在同不拿枪的敌人的斗争中，都表现了无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于毛泽东思想，无限忠于毛主席革命路线的崇高品质。伟大祖国的海上长城比以往任何时候都更加巩固，更加坚强，更加不可逾越了。
    目前，海军党委、各级领导机关和各级领导干部，正在遵照毛主席关于“发扬成绩，纠正错误，以利再战”的教导，狠抓基层四好初评工作。他们决心在无产阶级文化大革命的新形势下，更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，突出无产阶级政治，进一步加强基层政治工作，把基层建设，把四好连队运动提高到更新的水平，把部队革命化建设推向一个更新的阶段，为建设一支以林副主席为光辉榜样，无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于毛泽东思想，无限忠于毛主席革命路线的强大的人民海军而奋斗。
