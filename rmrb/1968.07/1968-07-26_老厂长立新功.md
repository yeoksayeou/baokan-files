Wen Zhensheng, the former director of the Liao Yang City Machine Tool Repair Factory, had implemented the capitalist reactionary line during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Through the enthusiastic help of the broad masses, he deeply recognized his mistakes and returned to the side of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

Although Old Wen was liberated, he was not incorporated into the revolutionary committee but was assigned to financial work. Some comrades who originally worked at the grassroots level became chairmen, vice-chairmen, and committee members of the revolutionary committee. Old Wen went from being a superior to a subordinate.

After two years of tempering during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, Old Wen deeply realized that being incorporated into the revolutionary committee is a revolutionary need, and doing financial work is also a revolutionary need. To defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, one must strive to the utmost in whatever position, without any personal motives. Therefore, he always enthusiastically helped the newly established revolutionary committee to consolidate and develop, determined to achieve new merits for the new revolutionary power.

One day, all the workers of the factory gathered to go to the city for a meeting. The chairman of the revolutionary committee, Meng Qingzhu, walked up to Old Wen and affectionately said, "Old Wen, how about you lead the team today?" Old Wen happily agreed. But the chairman's consultative tone made him think: Why does the chairman or committee members always assign work to him in a consultative tone? Why does the revolutionary committee always ask him, "Do you have any more opinions?" before dispersing the meeting when he participates? A series of question marks made him feel that these things, on one hand, show the revolutionary committee's respect and trust for him, but on the other hand, show that the revolutionary committee has some reservations about using him. He thought: He has been educated by the Party and Chairman Mao for a longer time and has some work experience. He should be a good advisor for the factory revolutionary committee and do more work. To let the revolutionary committee boldly use him, he separately found the committee members, actively checked himself, and requested the revolutionary committee to boldly assign him work and strictly demand of him, letting him do whatever work.

For a period, he found that some comrades in the supply and marketing department did not persist in studying Chairman Mao's works. After a careful investigation, he found that the unit lacked organizational leadership. He immediately went to the revolutionary committee to request to go there. After arriving, he actively organized everyone, took the lead in studying, took the lead in criticizing and repudiating revisionism, and took the lead in sharing study experiences. Under Old Wen's influence, the masses' awareness of studying Chairman Mao's works universally improved, and good deeds emerged in abundance. This relatively backward unit has now become one of the more advanced units in the factory.

Old Wen's revolutionary spirit of striving wholeheartedly to consolidate and develop the revolutionary committee has greatly educated the committee members. They regard Old Wen as their good advisor and good assistant.

    老厂长立新功
    温振生同志是原辽阳市机床修理厂的厂长，在无产阶级文化大革命中执行了资产阶级反动路线。经过广大群众的热情帮助，他对自己的错误有了深刻认识，回到了毛主席的革命路线一边。
    老温虽然被解放了，但并没有被结合到革委会里来，而是被分配做财务工作。原在基层工作的同志，有的担任了革委会主任，有的当了副主任和委员。老温由上级变为下级。
    经过两年无产阶级文化大革命锻炼的老温，深深认识到：结合进革委会是革命需要，作财务工作也是革命需要。为捍卫毛主席革命路线而战斗，不管在什么岗位上都要竭尽全力，决不能有丝毫的私心杂念。因此，他对于新生的革委会，总是满腔热情地帮助它巩固和发展，立志为新生的革命政权立新功。
    一天，全厂职工集合去市里开大会。革委会主任孟庆柱走到老温跟前，亲切地对他说：“老温，今天开会你带队怎么样？”老温高兴地答应了。但革委会主任商量的口气，却引起了他许多联想：为什么革委会主任或委员每次分配自己工作，都是用商量的口气？为什么革委会召开会议，只要是我参加，总要问一问我，“还有什么意见没有”才散会？一连串问号，使他感觉到，这些事情，一方面说明革委会对自己的尊重和信任，另一方面说明革委会对使用自己还有顾虑。他想：自己受党和毛主席的教育时间比较长，有一些工作经验，我应该为厂革委会当好参谋，多做些工作。为了让革委会大胆地使用自己，他分别找革委会成员，主动检查自己，请求革委会大胆分配他工作，严格要求他，有什么工作尽管让他干。
    有一段时间，他发现供销部门有的同志，没有坚持学习毛主席著作，仔细一了解，原来是这个单位缺乏组织领导，他马上去找革命委员会请求到那里去。到那里以后，他积极把大家组织起来，自己带头学习，带头斗私批修，带头谈学习体会。在老温的带动下，广大群众学习毛主席著作的自觉性普遍提高，好人好事层出不穷。这个比较后进的单位，现在已成为全厂比较先进的单位。
    老温这种全心全意为巩固和发展革委会而努力工作的革命精神，使革委会成员受到很大教育，他们把老温当作自己的好参谋、好助手。　红炮兵
