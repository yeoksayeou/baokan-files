Our great leader Chairman Mao recently pointed out deeply: "Whether to protect or suppress the broad masses of the people is the fundamental difference between the Communist Party and the Kuomintang, the fundamental difference between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, and the fundamental difference between proletarian dictatorship and bourgeois dictatorship." I have repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's great teachings, and my soul has been deeply moved again. I have further realized that to carry out Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, we must believe in the masses, rely on the masses, and firmly support the revolutionary pioneering spirit of the masses. Whether a leading cadre sincerely accepts or resists and retaliates against the masses' criticism is a fundamental attitude towards the masses and is also the fundamental difference between carrying out Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and carrying out the bourgeois reactionary line.

At the beginning of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, I once carried out the bourgeois reactionary line and committed serious errors. On November 10, 1966, our great leader Chairman Mao issued the instruction from Tiananmen Gate: "You must put politics in command, go among the masses, and be with the masses to make the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution even better." This instruction awakened me from the confusion of the bourgeois reactionary line like a spring thunder. Comparing myself with Chairman Mao's instruction, I deeply felt remorse. Who is afraid of the masses? Only the Kuomintang reactionaries are afraid of the masses. They are opposed to the masses, so they are extremely isolated. It is not strange that they are afraid of the masses. Where is the logic for a Marxist-Leninist to be afraid of the masses? Under the enthusiastic help of the revolutionary masses of the entire factory, I firmly carried out Chairman Mao's great instruction, bravely went among the masses, and welcomed the masses to criticize me seriously. Meetings to criticize me were held many times, and each time the criticism touched my soul, prompting me to deeply examine my mistakes, helping me to return to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. I also printed my shortcomings and mistakes in my work into materials, distributed them to the masses, wrote them into big-character posters, and publicly announced them. I went to the central experimental room where I had once suppressed the opinions of the masses to listen to their criticisms. Practice educated me: the masses' criticism is the greatest concern and help for me politically. Without the masses' criticism, I would not be able to break free from the shackles of the bourgeois reactionary line and would inevitably go astray. Only by correctly handling the mass movement, sincerely accepting the masses' criticism, can I correctly recognize myself, correct my shortcomings and mistakes, and firmly stand on Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, with the masses heart to heart, shoulder to shoulder, united together, fighting together, and winning together.

After taking up the work of being a member of the Qingdao Municipal Revolutionary Committee and the head of the factory revolutionary committee, I, according to Chairman Mao's teachings, cherish the revolutionary pioneering spirit of the masses even more, understand the masses' criticism and help to me even more, and firmly protect those who have criticized me, even those who have severely criticized me but have themselves made serious mistakes. There was a responsible comrade from a revolutionary mass organization who criticized me the most severely in the past, but later he made serious mistakes. I patiently and sincerely helped him, visited his home many times to talk with him, studied Chairman Mao's teachings together, and used my own experiences of making and correcting mistakes to enlighten and help him, so that he quickly returned to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Then the masses elected him as a standing committee member of the factory revolutionary committee. Under the brilliant illumination of Mao Zedong Thought, my relationship with the masses became even closer. We think as one, work as one, and strive together with one goal, accurately and firmly striking at a handful of class enemies.

Suppressing the masses' criticism and striking at the revolutionary spirit of the people is to suppress the revolutionary mass movement and to destroy the fundamental interests of the people. As a revolutionary cadre, one must always believe in the masses, rely on the masses, mobilize the masses, firmly cherish the revolutionary spirit of the masses, fully give play to the masses' enthusiasm and creativity, and lead the broad masses of the people to advance victoriously along the revolutionary course indicated by Chairman Mao.

### 诚恳接受群众批评　保护群众的革命精神

    诚恳接受群众批评　保护群众的革命精神
    青岛市革命委员会委员、青岛钢厂革命委员会负责人　刘华
    我们伟大领袖毛主席最近深刻指出：“对广大人民群众是保护还是镇压，是共产党同国民党的根本区别，是无产阶级同资产阶级的根本区别，是无产阶级专政同资产阶级专政的根本区别。”我反复学习了毛主席的这一伟大教导，灵魂深处又一次受到触动，进一步认识到要贯彻执行毛主席无产阶级革命路线就要相信群众，依靠群众，坚决支持群众的革命首创精神。一个领导干部对群众的批评，是诚恳接受还是抵制报复，这是对群众的根本态度问题，也是执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线还是执行资产阶级反动路线的根本区别。
    无产阶级文化大革命一开始，我曾一度执行资产阶级反动路线，犯了严重的错误。一九六六年十一月十日，伟大领袖毛主席在天安门城楼上发出“你们要政治挂帅，到群众里面去，和群众在一起，把无产阶级文化大革命搞得更好”的指示，象一声春雷，使我从资产阶级反动路线迷途中猛醒过来。对照毛主席的指示检查自己，深深感到痛心。什么人才害怕群众呢？只有国民党反动派才害怕群众。他们和群众是对立的，因此他们非常孤立，他们害怕群众是不奇怪的。那里有马克思列宁主义者害怕群众的道理呢？在全厂广大革命群众的热情帮助下，我坚决执行毛主席的伟大指示，勇敢地到群众中去，欢迎群众对自己进行严肃批评。群众批评我的会议开了许多次，每一次批评，都触及了我的灵魂，促使我深刻检查错误，帮助我回到毛主席的革命路线上来。我还把自己工作中的缺点错误印成材料，散发给群众，写成大字报公布于众，并且到我曾经压制过群众意见的中心实验室去听取他们的批评意见。实践教育了我：群众的批评是对我政治上最大的关怀，最大的帮助。没有群众的批评，我就不能挣脱资产阶级反动路线的枷锁，必然走向绝路。只有正确对待群众运动，诚恳接受群众的批评，才能正确认识自己，改正缺点错误，坚定地站在毛主席革命路线上，和群众心贴心，肩并肩，团结在一起，战斗在一起，胜利在一起。
    我担任青岛市革命委员会委员和厂革命委员会负责工作后，按照毛主席的教导，更加爱护群众的革命首创精神，更加理解群众对我的批评和帮助，对批评过我的群众，甚至对那些严厉批评过我而自己又犯了严重错误的同志，也坚决保护。有一个革命群众组织的一位负责同志，以前批评我最厉害，后来他犯了严重错误。我就耐心诚恳地帮助他，多次到他家里和他谈心，一起学习毛主席的教导，用自己犯错误和改正错误的经验教训启发帮助他，使他很快回到了毛主席的革命路线上来。接着群众推选他为厂革命委员会常委。在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，我和群众之间的关系更亲密了，心往一处想，劲往一处使，齐心协力，目标一致，稳准狠地打击一小撮阶级敌人。
    压制群众的批评，打击人民群众的革命精神，就是镇压革命的群众运动，就是破坏人民群众的根本利益。作为一个革命的领导干部，要永远相信群众，依靠群众，放手发动群众，坚决爱护群众的革命精神，充分发挥群众的积极性和创造性，带领广大人民群众沿着毛主席指引的革命航道胜利前进。
