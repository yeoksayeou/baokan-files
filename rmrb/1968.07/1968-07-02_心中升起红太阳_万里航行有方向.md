On the afternoon of June 30, at six o'clock, our great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin Biao received our military cadres and soldiers. Our hearts were filled with boundless waves of happiness. At this most joyous moment, we once again recall the battle history of our young People's Navy growing and strengthening under the brilliant guidance of Mao Zedong Thought.

Dear Chairman Mao, as early as 1953, you personally inspected and reviewed our naval fleet, and wrote a brilliant inscription for us: "To oppose the aggression of imperialism, we must definitely build a strong navy." This pointed out the direction for our naval construction. In 1954, on National Day, we stood by your side to participate in the National Day celebration and were fortunate to see you again. Over the past decade, your kind instructions have always been deeply engraved in our hearts; your brilliant image has always been deeply imprinted in our minds. Whether it was during our struggle against fierce winds and waves, or in our battles against the reactionary forces of the U.S. and the KMT, whenever we thought of you, whenever we thought of your wise instructions, we found boundless strength. We trampled the ten thousand waves under our feet and defeated the invading U.S. and KMT reactionaries, sending them to their graves in the sea. In one naval battle, we faced large-tonnage, heavily-armed U.S.-made KMT ships, and encountered high winds and rough seas. However, whenever we thought of you, whenever we thought of your great instruction to "dare to struggle and dare to win," we became fearless and successfully navigated through the narrow channel filled with reefs.

Dear Chairman Mao, your brilliant military line not only enabled us to defeat the armed enemies time and again, but also allowed us to defeat the unarmed enemies. The counter-revolutionary revisionist element Luo Ruiqing's "Great Competition" evil wind also blew into our unit. We used the mirror of Mao Zedong Thought to expose the wolfish ambitions of these bad elements and engaged in a head-on struggle with them. They shouted that "politics cannot go to sea, cannot lay mines, cannot fire cannons," so we used your and Vice Chairman Lin Biao's instructions on emphasizing politics, citing the facts of our past naval victories to refute them strongly; they wanted to hold a great competition, so we actively studied and applied your brilliant works. In this way, we engaged in a head-on struggle, the more we struggled, the more deeply your proletarian revolutionary line penetrated our hearts; the more we struggled, the clearer our minds and eyes became, the more ardent our revolutionary spirit grew, thus we withstood the evil wind and repelled the reverse current.

Dear Chairman Mao, looking back at the battle history of our People's Navy's growth, which step of growth was not due to your kind instructions? Which battle was not won by relying on your brilliant thoughts? Which victory was not a victory of your revolutionary line? Your brilliant thoughts are our most powerful ideological weapon to defeat all class enemies at home and abroad, and your proletarian revolutionary line is the lifeline of every revolutionary soldier. "Navigating the seas relies on the helmsman, making revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought." We must shout a thousand times, ten thousand times: Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought! Long live the victory of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line! Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!

Dear Chairman Mao, today, at this critical moment of achieving a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, you have once again received us. This is the greatest encouragement, the greatest care, and the greatest spur for us. We will forever read your books, listen to your words, and act according to your instructions, becoming your good soldiers.

    心中升起红太阳  万里航行有方向
    海军四四一一部队副部队长　崔玉栋副政治委员　阎起凤
    六月三十日下午六时，我们伟大的统帅毛主席和他的亲密战友林彪副主席接见了我军干部战士，我们心头涌起了无限幸福的浪花。在这最幸福的时刻，我们再一次忆起了年轻的人民海军在伟大的毛泽东思想光辉照耀下成长壮大的战斗历程。
    敬爱的毛主席，早在一九五三年，您老人家就视察和检阅了我们海军舰艇部队，亲笔为我们写下了光辉题词：“为了反对帝国主义的侵略，我们一定要建立强大的海军。”给我们海军建设指明了方向。一九五四年国庆节，我们来到您的身边，参加国庆观礼，又一次幸福地见到了您老人家。十多年来，您老人家的亲切教导，始终铭刻在我们心里；您老人家的光辉形象，一直深深地印在我们脑海中。无论是在同狂风恶浪搏斗时，还是在同美蒋反动派战斗中，只要一想起您，一想起您的英明教导，我们就有了无穷的力量，把那万里恶浪脚下踩，打得来犯的美蒋反动派葬大海。在一次海战中，我们面临的是吨位大、火力强的美制蒋舰，又遇到风大浪高的恶劣天气，但是，我们一想起您老人家，一想起您老人家“敢于斗争，敢于胜利”的伟大教导，就浑身是胆，顺利穿过了礁石丛立的狭窄航道。
    敬爱的毛主席，您的光辉建军路线，不仅使我们一次又一次地战胜了拿枪的敌人，而且使我们战胜了不拿枪的敌人。反革命修正主义分子罗瑞卿掀起的“大比武”妖风，也曾刮到我们部队。我们用毛泽东思想照妖镜照出了这些坏家伙的狼子野心，跟他们针锋相对地展开了斗争。他们叫嚷什么“政治出不了海，放不了雷，开不了炮”，我们就运用您老人家和林彪副主席关于突出政治的教导，列举历次海战胜利的事实，进行了有力的驳斥；他们要搞大比武，我们就活学活用您的光辉著作。就这样针锋相对地进行斗争，越斗，您老人家的无产阶级革命路线越深入人心；越斗，指战员们的心越明，眼越亮，革命精神越昂扬，从而顶住了妖风，击退了逆流。
    敬爱的毛主席，回顾我们人民海军成长的战斗历程，哪一步成长不是靠您老人家的亲切教导？哪一次斗争不是靠您的光辉思想取胜？哪一个胜利不是您的革命路线的胜利？您的光辉思想是我们战胜国内外一切阶级敌人的最强大思想武器，您的无产阶级革命路线是我们每个革命战士的生命线。“大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想。”我们要一千遍一万遍地高呼：战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！毛主席的无产阶级革命路线胜利万岁！毛主席万岁！万万岁！
    敬爱的毛主席，今天，在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的关键时刻，您又一次接见了我们，这是对我们的最大鼓舞、最大关怀、最大鞭策。我们要永远读您的书，听您的话，照您的指示办事，做您的好战士。
