In the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, our family, through revolutionary criticism, established Mao Zedong Thought study classes, engaged in self-criticism and criticism of revisionism, and underwent a fundamental change in our spiritual outlook. In the past, when we were together, we would only talk about trivial matters of daily life. Now, we often discuss national affairs. In our family, we insist on studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought actively, constantly using Mao Zedong Thought to examine the words and deeds of each family member. We do this: if someone's actions do not align with Chairman Mao's teachings, we criticize them; if someone holds high the red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, we learn from them. Our family of seven people, seven hearts, all beat for Chairman Mao.

Starting from last April and May, our commune and production brigade frequently held meetings to criticize and denounce China's Khrushchev. I thought that overthrowing China's Khrushchev and defending Chairman Mao is the top priority, and everyone has a responsibility. I discussed with a few comrades the idea of carrying out revolutionary criticism within the family, making every family a revolutionary criticism combat unit. I started with my own family, holding a criticism meeting every week, fiercely criticizing China's Khrushchev and his gang's reactionary revisionist fallacies such as "three freedoms and one contract," "four freedoms," and "exploitation is glorious." Sometimes, to thoroughly criticize one or two fallacies, we spent five or six evenings in a row. We fiercely criticized China's Khrushchev's heinous crimes of attacking Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought. Our entire family is loyal to Chairman Mao, and everyone eagerly speaks up. My father said, "Before liberation, I worked as a farmhand for the landlord, toiling all year but still not having enough to eat. The landlord even tied me up and locked me away for more than twenty days. It was Chairman Mao who saved us from the abyss. China's Khrushchev dares to oppose our great leader Chairman Mao, I must resolutely overthrow him." My mother said, "Comrade Lin Biao instructed us to study the 'Three Articles' as our guiding principles, but China's Khrushchev opposes us learning them. The more he opposes, the more we must learn, and learn the 'Three Articles' for life, follow Chairman Mao's revolutionary path for life!" My 73-year-old grandmother also angrily denounced China's Khrushchev and his gang for using the reactionary revisionist fallacies of "exploitation is glorious," "three freedoms and one contract," and "four freedoms" to oppose Chairman Mao, oppose Mao Zedong Thought, and oppose Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Our entire family shouted slogans: "Exploitation is a crime!" "Resolutely overthrow China's Khrushchev!" "Forever follow Chairman Mao in revolution!"

In addition to holding denunciation meetings, our family also wrote big-character posters to expose China's Khrushchev's crimes. In our family, only I have studied for three or four years, so I write the big-character posters. One evening, I returned home from a meeting at midnight, and my grandmother had already prepared ink, paper, and brush for me to help her write a criticism poster. She dictated a sentence, and I wrote a sentence, continuing until after two in the morning. I told my grandmother to go to sleep, but she refused, reciting a quote from Chairman Mao: "With firm resolve, fearing no sacrifice, surmounting every difficulty to win victory." She said, "We must carry the Cultural Revolution through to the end, and we must not fear hardship. Let's continue writing!" My father, who had already gone to bed, got up again. After my mother prepared the paste, she also joined in. I wrote until around three in the morning, truly feeling very tired, and suggested continuing the next evening. My grandmother said, "You go to sleep, but China's Khrushchev won't sleep!" I thought, indeed, upon reflection, I do not hate China's Khrushchev and the handful of capitalist roaders within the party as much as the elders do, nor do I love Chairman Mao as deeply as the elders do. Thus, I persevered and continued writing until dawn.

After our family established the Mao Zedong Thought study class, everyone elected my mother as the study group leader and me as the small teacher. How should this small teacher be effective? I adopted the method of mutual teaching and learning. My grandmother is illiterate, old, and has poor memory, taking six or seven evenings to memorize a single quote. My younger sister helped her.

Our family's Mao Zedong Thought study class, with Chairman Mao's latest instructions as the guideline, studies the "Three Articles," engages in self-criticism and criticism of revisionism. Each study session emphasizes Chairman Mao's consistent advocacy of revolutionary study style, linking theory with practice, applying what is learned, revealing thoughts, criticizing selfishness, and helping each other. My father has a heavy burden of selfishness. In the study session, he revealed his "selfishness." He said, "Our family has six plots of southern bamboo, and sometimes I think about staying home to weave bamboo baskets to sell, making a few more dollars, and not wanting to manage collective affairs." Father revealed his "selfishness," but did not criticize it. Mother criticized him, saying, "You only reveal 'selfishness,' but do not criticize it." Father said, "How do I criticize? I don't understand, you all help me criticize and judge." Mother then read a quote from Chairman Mao to him: "Criticize selfishness, criticize revisionism." She told him to use Mao Zedong Thought to criticize. Grandmother also said, "We wrote so many big-character posters criticizing China's Khrushchev, you must cleanse China's Khrushchev's poison from your mind." Through everyone's help, Father realized that doing less collective work and more private work is more selfishness, which is disloyal to Chairman Mao. Our family's study class, in the process of self-criticism and criticism of revisionism, everyone did a good job of revealing selfishness without fear of embarrassment, criticizing selfishness without fear of pain. Everyone said, "Selfishness" is the poison spread by China's Khrushchev. If we do not eliminate it, we cannot be loyal to Chairman Mao. Therefore, as soon as "selfishness" is discovered, everyone rises to "annihilate" it, fighting a "people's war." Once, when exchanging family fertilizer, both parents and I advocated handing over all the family's fertilizer to the collective, but Grandmother disagreed, wanting to keep some good fertilizer in the private plot. In the study session, I led everyone to study Chairman Mao's quote: "Communist Party members, regardless of time and place, should never put personal interests first, but should subordinate personal interests to the interests of the nation and the people." Everyone linked it with the criticism of China's Khrushchev's fallacies of "three freedoms and one contract" and "four freedoms," helping Grandmother. Father said, "Last time, everyone criticized the 'selfishness' in my mind, this time we must also criticize the 'selfishness' in your mind; you do not want to hand over good fertilizer, 'selfishness' is at the forefront, is this not falling for China's Khrushchev's poison?" Mother also said Grandmother had fallen for China's Khrushchev's poison. Grandmother realized her mistake, her thoughts cleared, and she handed over all the family's fertilizer to the collective. Another time, Father wanted to take a pig to the market to sell for more money, and Grandmother knew about it, immediately criticizing him, saying, "We just criticized the fallacies of 'four freedoms,' and you are going to create a big 'freedom'? This is a struggle between two paths, which path will you take? I will sell it to the state, following the path indicated by Chairman Mao." Mother read to him the quote, "Completely selfless, dedicated to others." In this way, everyone's thoughts were unified with Mao Zedong Thought, happily selling the pig to the state.

Through the criticism of China's Khrushchev, through self-criticism and criticism of revisionism, our family loves Chairman Mao even more and hates China's Khrushchev even more. We deeply understand that only by thoroughly studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought can we not forget our roots, not take the wrong path, and forever follow Chairman Mao in revolution.

    革命大批判促进我们全家红
    广州部队学习毛主席著作积极分子
    广西凤山县谋屯公社女民兵班长  毛凤銮
    在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，我们家通过革命大批判，开办毛泽东思想学习班，斗私批修，精神面貌发生了根本的变化。过去一家人在一起，谈的都是生活小事，现在经常谈论的是国家大事。我们在家庭里坚持活学活用毛泽东思想，时时处处都用毛泽东思想对照家里每个成员的言行，做到了：谁做事不符合毛主席的教导，就批评谁；谁毛泽东思想红旗举得高，就向谁学习。我们一家七口人，七颗红心，颗颗都向着毛主席。
    从去年四、五月起，我们公社和生产队经常召开批判、声讨中国赫鲁晓夫的大会。我想，打倒中国赫鲁晓夫，保卫毛主席，这是头等大事，人人有责。我就和几个同志商量在家庭里开展革命大批判，使每个家庭都成为革命大批判的战斗小组。首先从我家做起，每周都坚持开一次批判会，狠狠批判中国赫鲁晓夫及其同伙的“三自一包”、“四大自由”、“剥削有功”等反革命修正主义谬论。有时为了批深批透一两个谬论，连续用五、六个晚上的时间。我们狠批了中国赫鲁晓夫恶毒攻击毛主席和毛泽东思想的罪行。我们全家都心怀对毛主席的一个“忠”字，人人争着发言。父亲说：“解放前，我给地主打长工，一年累到头还吃不饱，地主还把我绑起来，关了二十多天。是毛主席把我们救出火坑。中国赫鲁晓夫竟敢反对我们伟大领袖毛主席，我要坚决打倒他。”母亲说：“林副主席指示我们，要把‘老三篇’作为座右铭来学，可是中国赫鲁晓夫反对我们学，他越反对，我们越要学，要学一辈子‘老三篇’，跟毛主席走一辈子革命路！”七十三岁的祖母也愤怒地声讨了中国赫鲁晓夫及其同伙用“剥削有功”、“三自一包”、“四大自由”等反革命修正主义谬论来对抗毛主席、对抗毛泽东思想和对抗毛主席的革命路线的滔天罪行。我们全家高呼口号：“剥削有罪！”“坚决打倒中国赫鲁晓夫！”“永远跟着毛主席干革命！”
    我们家除了开声讨会外，还写大字报揭露中国赫鲁晓夫的罪行。我们家里只有我读过三、四年书，大字报便由我来写。一天晚上，我开会到十二点钟才回家，祖母早就准备了笔、墨、纸，要我帮她写批判大字报。她说一句，我写一句，写到深夜两点多钟，我叫祖母去睡觉，她不干，还给我念了一条毛主席语录：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”她说：“我们要把文化大革命进行到底，就要不怕苦。往下写吧！”我父亲本来已经睡下，听这么一说，又爬起来，我母亲煮好浆糊后，也来参加。我写到三点多钟，确实很疲倦了，建议明天晚上再写。我祖母说：“你睡觉，中国赫鲁晓夫可没有睡觉咧！”我想，可不是，检查起来，我对中国赫鲁晓夫和党内一小撮走资派没有老人们恨得狠，对毛主席没有老人们爱得深。于是，我又坚持写下去，一直写到天亮。
    我们家庭办起了毛泽东思想学习班后，大家选母亲当学习小组长，选我当小教员。这个小教员怎么当好呢？我采取了互教互学的办法。我祖母不识字，年老了，记忆力又差，要六、七个晚上才能背得一条语录。我小妹就来教她。
    我们家的毛泽东思想学习班，以毛主席最新指示为纲，学习“老三篇”，斗私批修。每次学习都注意发扬毛主席一贯提倡的革命学风，理论联系实际，学了就用，亮思想，斗私心，互相帮助。我父亲私心比较重，他在学习会上亮了“私”字。他说：“我们家有六蔸南竹，有时，我就想在家编竹箩卖，多捞几个钱，不想管集体的事。”父亲把“私”字亮了出来，但没有进行批判。母亲便批评他说：“你光亮‘私’字，不斗私。”父亲说：“怎么个批判法，我还不懂，你们帮我批一批，判一判。”母亲便给他读毛主席语录：“要斗私，批修。”叫他用毛泽东思想来批判。祖母也说：“我们写那么多大字报批判中国赫鲁晓夫，你就要在头脑里肃清中国赫鲁晓夫放的毒。”通过大家的帮助，父亲认识到少出一点集体工，多干一点私活，就多一分私心，就是对毛主席的不忠。我们家的学习班，在斗私批修中，人人做到了亮私不怕丑，斗私不怕痛。大家都说：“私”字，就是中国赫鲁晓夫散布的毒，不清除它，就不能忠于毛主席，所以一发现“私”字，大家就起来“围歼”，打“人民战争”。有一次交家肥，父母亲和我都主张把家里的肥料全部交给集体，祖母不同意，要留一点好肥放在自留地里。在学习会上，我先领大家学习毛主席语录：“共产党员无论何时何地都不应以个人利益放在第一位，而应以个人利益服从于民族的和人民群众的利益。”大家结合批判中国赫鲁晓夫的“三自一包”、“四大自由”的谬论，对祖母进行了帮助。我父亲说：“上次大家批判了我头脑里的‘私’字，这次我们也要批判你头脑里的‘私’字；你不愿交好肥，‘私’字当头，不正是中了中国赫鲁晓夫散布的毒吗？”母亲也说祖母是中了中国赫鲁晓夫的毒。祖母认识到了自己的错误，思想搞通了，就把全部家肥统统交给了集体。又有一次，我父亲想拿一头猪到集市去卖，多卖几个钱，祖母知道后，马上批评他说：“我们刚批判了‘四大自由’的谬论，你又去搞个大‘自由’啦？这是两条道路的斗争，看你走哪一条？我要卖给国家，走毛主席指引的路。”母亲又给他念了“毫不利己专门利人”的语录。就这样，全家人的思想用毛泽东思想统一起来，愉快地把猪卖给了国家。
    通过对中国赫鲁晓夫的批判，通过斗私批修，我们一家人更热爱毛主席，更痛恨中国赫鲁晓夫。我们深刻地认识到，只有很好地活学活用毛泽东思想，才不会忘本，才不会走错路，才能永远跟着毛主席干革命。
