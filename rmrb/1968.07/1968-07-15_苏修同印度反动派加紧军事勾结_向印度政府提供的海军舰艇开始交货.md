The Soviet revisionist renegade clique has begun delivering naval vessels to the Indian reactionary government. The submarine "Kalarvani" recently arrived at the port of Visakhapatnam in the Bay of Bengal. This is another heinous act by the Soviet revisionists in their efforts to bolster the Indian reactionaries against China, the people, and neighboring countries.

The "Kalarvani" is the first of four submarines and a batch of other naval vessels that the Soviet revisionists are scheduled to provide to the Indian reactionaries this year. Indian newspapers have revealed that a group of Indian naval personnel are currently in the Soviet Union receiving training on how to operate submarines.

Since the beginning of this year, the Soviet revisionist renegade clique and American imperialism have closely coordinated to intensify their counter-revolutionary military collusion with the Indian reactionaries. Following Soviet leader Kosygin's January visit to New Delhi, where he secretly discussed providing more military "aid" to India, Soviet naval chief Gorshkov visited India in February to specifically plot further Soviet assistance in expanding the Indian reactionaries' navy. At the end of March, the commander of the Soviet Pacific Fleet, Amelko, also visited New Delhi. Through these series of counter-revolutionary activities, the Soviet revisionists and the Indian reactionary government have struck a dirty deal: the Soviet revisionists will provide submarines and other naval vessels to the Indian reactionaries, helping India transform the port of Visakhapatnam in the Bay of Bengal and Blair Port in the Andaman Islands into naval bases. In return, India will allow Soviet vessels to dock and be repaired in Indian ports, effectively providing naval bases to the Soviet revisionists.

The Soviet revisionist renegade clique, in collusion with U.S. imperialism, is helping the Indian reactionaries to expand their military and prepare for war, furthering the Indian reactionaries' anti-China and anti-people agenda. This new crime will only "lift a rock to drop it on one's own feet," and will inevitably face strong condemnation from the Indian people and the people of various Asian countries.

### 苏修同印度反动派加紧军事勾结  向印度政府提供的海军舰艇开始交货

    苏修同印度反动派加紧军事勾结
    向印度政府提供的海军舰艇开始交货
    新华社讯　新德里消息：苏修叛徒集团向印度反动政府提供的潜水艇“卡尔瓦尔人号”，在最近到达印度孟加拉湾的维萨卡帕特南港。这是苏修扶植印度反动派加紧反华、反人民和反对印度邻国的又一罪恶行径。
      “卡尔瓦尔人号”是今年苏修预定向印度反动派提供的四艘潜水艇和一批其他海军舰艇中的第一艘。印度报纸透露，目前，有一批印度海军人员在苏联接受操纵潜水艇的训练。
    今年以来，苏修叛徒集团和美帝国主义紧密配合，加紧同印度反动派进行反革命军事勾结。继苏修头目柯西金一月到新德里同印度反动派密谈，保证向印度提供更多的军事“援助”以后，二月，苏修海军头目戈尔什科夫又到印度具体策划了苏修进一步帮助印度反动派扩充海军的勾当。三月底，苏修太平洋舰队司令阿梅尔科接着又到新德里活动。通过以上一系列的反革命活动，苏修和印度反动政府作成了一笔肮脏的交易：苏修向印度反动派提供潜水艇和其他海军舰艇，帮助印度把孟加拉湾的维萨卡帕特南港和安达曼群岛的布莱尔港改建成海军基地。印度则允许苏修舰艇在印度海港停泊和维修，实际上是由印度反动政府向苏修提供海军基地。
    苏修叛徒集团勾结美帝帮助印度反动派扩军备战，扶植印度反动派加紧反华、反人民的这一新罪行，只能“搬起石头打自己的脚”，必将遭到印度人民和亚洲各国人民的强烈谴责。
