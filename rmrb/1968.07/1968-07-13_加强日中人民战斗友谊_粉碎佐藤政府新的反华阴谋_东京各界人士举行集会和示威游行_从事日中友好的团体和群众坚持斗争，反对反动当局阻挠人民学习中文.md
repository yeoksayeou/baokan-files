About a thousand people from various sectors in Tokyo held a rally and demonstration march on the afternoon of the 6th, expressing their determination to further strengthen the combat friendship between the peoples of Japan and China, smash the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," and strive for the early restoration of diplomatic relations between Japan and China.

This rally was initiated by the headquarters of the Japan-China Friendship Association (orthodox), the Japan Committee for Asia-Africa Solidarity, and the Japan Association for Promotion of International Trade.

A statement was adopted at the meeting. The statement praised the victories of China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the revolutionary struggles of the Vietnamese people and the people of the world. The statement emphasized that the immediate task for the Japanese people is to dismantle U.S. military bases in Japan and smash the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty."

The chairman of the Japan-China Friendship Association (orthodox) headquarters, Miyazaki Seiken, and the secretary of the Japan-China Friendship Association (orthodox) Fukuoka Prefecture branch, Inokuchi Junichi, spoke at the meeting. They both pointed out that the struggle to smash the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" is the central task at present. Without this struggle, diplomatic relations between Japan and China cannot be restored, and the unity between the peoples of Japan and China cannot be strengthened.

Ogawa, a representative of the farmers in Chiba Prefecture's Sanrizuka who are persistently fighting against the construction of the "New Tokyo International Airport" by the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries, also spoke at the meeting. He said, "We must use revolutionary violence to oppose counter-revolutionary violence; otherwise, we cannot achieve victory. We must fearlessly sacrifice ourselves and fight against the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries. We will surely achieve final victory."

Messages from the China-Japan Friendship Association and the Chinese People's Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries were read at the meeting, which were greeted with enthusiastic applause from the entire audience.

After the meeting, the participants marched through the streets of Tokyo, holding high red flags with the words "Long Live Mao Zedong Thought" and banners with slogans such as "Smash the U.S.-Japan 'Security Treaty'" and "Down with U.S. Imperialism." They shouted anti-U.S. slogans. The demonstrators raised their fists in front of the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo and shouted, "Yankees, go home!"

About a hundred Chinese language teachers, scholars, and students in Japan held a demonstration march on the 7th to protest the new anti-China conspiracy plotted by the Japanese reactionary authorities.

As the Japan-China friendship movement deepens, more and more Japanese people are learning Chinese. This situation has made the Japanese reactionaries anxious, so they recently plotted to control the Japanese people's learning of Chinese through the method of "examinations" for students learning Chinese and attempted to mobilize them to participate in anti-China activities through so-called "qualification registration." In recent days, Chinese language teachers and students who are enthusiastic about Japan-China friendship, as well as organizations such as the China Research Institute, have been holding various meetings and issuing statements to oppose this conspiracy by the Japanese reactionary authorities.

Participants in the demonstration on the 7th started distributing leaflets to passersby early in the morning near the "examination site" and held a rally in front of the "examination site," demanding the cancellation of the "examination." Speakers at the meeting emphasized that the Japanese people learn Chinese to strengthen the friendship and unity between the peoples of Japan and China. They will not allow the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries to use the people's learning of Chinese to serve their anti-China policies.

Faced with the resolute struggle of the Japanese people, the relevant authorities were forced to cancel the "examination." On the same day, a similar "examination" scheduled to be held in Osaka was also forced to be canceled.

Japanese revolutionary people, in the struggle against the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," learn and apply the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, and wage a tenacious and courageous struggle against U.S. imperialism and the Japanese reactionaries. This is a scene of revolutionary people in Yamaguchi Prefecture, Japan, studying "Quotations from Chairman Mao" during their struggle.

    从事日中友好的团体和群众坚持斗争，反对反动当局阻挠人民学习中文
    新华社讯　据东方通讯社报道：东京各界人士大约一千人六日下午举行集会和示威游行，表示决心进一步加强日中两国人民之间的战斗友谊，粉碎日美“安全条约”，争取早日恢复日中邦交。
    这次集会是由日中友好协会（正统）总部、亚非人民团结日本委员会和日本国际贸易促进协会等组织发起的。
    会上通过了一项声明。声明赞扬中国无产阶级文化大革命取得的胜利，以及越南人民和全世界人民的革命斗争取得的胜利。声明强调指出，争取拆除美国在日本的军事基地和粉碎日美“安全条约”，是日本人民当前的迫切任务。
    日中友好协会（正统）总部理事长宫崎世民和日中友好协会（正统）福冈县总部事务局长井口顺市在会上发表了讲话。他们一致指出，粉碎日美“安全条约”的斗争，是当前的中心任务。如果不进行这场斗争，日中邦交就不能恢复，日中两国人民之间的团结就不能加强。
    正在坚持反对美日反动派修建“新东京国际机场”斗争的千叶县三里塚的农民代表小川也在会上讲了话。他说：“我们必须用革命的暴力反对反革命的暴力，否则我们便不能取得胜利。我们必须不怕牺牲地同美日反动派进行斗争，我们必将取得最后胜利。”
    会上宣读了中日友好协会和中国人民对外文化友好协会给大会的电报，博得了全场热烈的掌声。
    会后，与会者沿着东京的大街举行了示威游行。他们高举着写有“毛泽东思想万岁”的红旗，和写着“粉碎日美‘安全条约’”“打倒美帝”的横幅标语，高呼反美口号。示威者在东京的美国大使馆前举着拳头高呼：“美国佬滚回去！”
    新华社讯　据东方通讯社报道：日本一百多名中文教师、学者和学生，七日举行示威游行，抗议日本反动当局策划新的反华阴谋。
    随着日中友好运动的深入发展，日本人民中间学习中文的人数越来越多。这种情况使日本反动派感到惶恐，因此它最近阴谋通过对学中文的学生实行“考试”的办法来加强控制日本人民学习中文，并企图通过对学中文的学生进行所谓合格“登记”的办法来动员他们参与反华活动。热心从事日中友好的中文师生以及中国研究所等团体最近以来一直在举行各种集会和发表声明，反对日本反动当局的这一阴谋。
    参加在七日举行的示威的人，从一清早就在“考场”附近向行人散发传单，并在“考场”前面举行集会，要求停止“考试”。在会上讲话的人强调指出，日本人民学习中文，是为了加强日中两国人民的友谊和团结。他们决不让美日反动派利用人民学习中文的事情来为他们敌视中国的政策服务。
    在日本人民的坚决斗争面前，有关当局被迫取消了“考试”。同一天，预定在大阪举行的同样的“考试”也被迫取消了。（附图片）
    日本革命人民，在反对日美“安全条约”的斗争中，学习和运用战无不胜的毛泽东思想，同美帝国主义和日本反动派展开英勇顽强的斗争。这是日本山口县的革命人民在斗争中学习《毛主席语录》。
