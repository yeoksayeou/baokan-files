The Soviet revisionist renegade clique and U.S. imperialism, amidst the clamor of their intensified counter-revolutionary collusion, signed a comprehensive 1968-1969 cultural exchange agreement in Moscow on July 15. This is yet another black market deal following the so-called "Non-Proliferation Treaty," the Soviet-U.S. consular agreement, the "nuclear protection" plan, and the direct flight route between New York and Moscow, among others, since June 10.

It is revealed that the newly signed cultural exchange agreement covers a wide range of fields, including science, technology, agriculture, health, medicine, education, radio, television, culture, and sports. It also includes the exchange of "artists," "experts," publications, exhibitions, and films, with the exchange of visiting "experts" alone involving more than twenty departments. The agreement also stipulates cooperation between the two countries in the so-called peaceful use of atomic energy.

The Soviet revisionist renegade clique, in order to meet their needs for a full-scale restoration of capitalism in the Soviet Union, has further opened the doors for the peddling of "American civilization" in the Soviet-U.S. cultural exchange agreement. According to revelations from the Washington side, the agreement stipulates that the Soviet revisionists will accept three large American art troupes, nearly twenty small performance units, "as widely as possible" distribute American films, assist in the "successful distribution" and "free distribution" of the magazine "U.S.A.," and hold American touring exhibitions in six Soviet cities, among other things.

U.S. imperialism is very satisfied with the Soviet revisionists' treacherous actions. U.S. Ambassador Thompson said at the signing ceremony in Moscow that the U.S. government "considers these exchanges to be of great importance, as they provide an opportunity for further understanding between our two countries."

Nikolai Lunkov, the Soviet Foreign Ministry director who signed the agreement on behalf of the Soviet revisionist clique, obsequiously advocated for further comprehensive collusion between the Soviet Union and the United States. He shamelessly said, "Technical and cultural exchanges are beneficial to the Soviet Union and the United States. The better and more extensive the exchanges in various fields, the better and more expansive the political relations will be."

The cultural exchange agreement signed by the Soviet Union and the United States began negotiations in early June in Moscow. It is revealed that during the negotiations, both sides expressed "high enthusiasm." This agreement is the sixth cultural exchange agreement signed by the Soviet Union and the United States since 1958. Soon after the signing of the first Soviet-U.S. cultural exchange agreement in 1958, the then-director of the U.S. Information Agency, Allen, gleefully said that the United States had "broken through a gap in the Iron Curtain" and "achieved victory in the ideological battle." If ten years ago the United States had to infiltrate the Soviet Union through a "gap" for "peaceful infiltration," then ten years later, today, with the Soviet revisionist renegade clique becoming a faithful servant and henchman kneeling before U.S. imperialism, reactionary American culture has surged into the Soviet Union like a tide.

### 美苏反革命黑交易连连成交  苏修同美帝签订文化协定大肆输入“美国文明”  文化协定从农业到原子能包罗万象　美帝对苏修叛卖行径十分满意

    美苏反革命黑交易连连成交
    苏修同美帝签订文化协定大肆输入“美国文明”
    文化协定从农业到原子能包罗万象　美帝对苏修叛卖行径十分满意
    据新华社十六日讯 苏修叛徒集团同美帝国主义在全面加紧反革命勾结的锣鼓声中，十五日在莫斯科签订了一项包罗万象的一九六八年——一九六九年文化交流协定。这是从六月十日以来，苏美继所谓“防止核扩散条约”、苏美领事条约、“核保护”计划以及纽约—莫斯科之间直达航线等等之后，又作成的一笔新的黑交易。
    据透露，这个新签订的所谓文化协定所规定的项目，包括科学、技术、农业、卫生、医药、教育、无线电、电视、文化和体育等等。还包括交换“艺术家”、“专家”、刊物、展览会和影片，其中仅交换访问的“专家”就涉及到二十多个部门。协定还规定两国在所谓和平利用原子能方面进行合作。
    苏修叛徒集团为了他们在苏联全面复辟资本主义的需要，在苏美文化交流协定中为贩卖“美国文明”进一步敞开大门。据华盛顿方面透露，协定规定，苏修将接纳三个大型美国艺术团，近二十个小型演出单位，“尽可能广泛地发行”美国影片，帮助“成功地发行”和“免费赠送”《美国》杂志，在苏联六个城市举办美国巡回展览等等。
    美帝国主义对苏修的叛卖行径十分满意。美国大使汤普森在莫斯科的签字仪式上说，美国政府“认为这些交流具有巨大的重要性，它提供了我们两国之间更进一步了解的机会”。
    代表苏修集团在协定上签字的苏联外交部司长尼·隆科夫奴颜婢膝地鼓吹苏美进一步全面勾结。他恬不知耻地说，技术和文化交流“有利于苏联和美国。在各个领域的交流进行得越好，越广泛，那么在政治领域内的关系也就会越好，越扩大”。
    苏美签订的这个文化交流协定是六月初开始在莫斯科谈判的。据透露，在谈判过程中，双方都表示了“很高的热情”。这个协定是苏美从一九五八年以来签订的第六个文化交流协定。在一九五八年苏美第一个文化交流协定签订后不久，当时的美国新闻署署长艾伦曾喜形于色地说，美国“在铁幕上突破一个缺口”，“在思想战斗中取得胜利”。如果说，十年前美国还要通过“缺口”向苏联进行“和平渗透”的话，那么十年后的今天，随着苏修叛徒集团成为跪倒在美帝国主义面前的忠实奴仆和爪牙，美国的反动文化已经象潮水一样涌进苏联。
