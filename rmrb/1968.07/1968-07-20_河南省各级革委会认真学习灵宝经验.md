The Henan Provincial Revolutionary Committees Seriously Study the Experience of Yinchuan

Determined to intensify class struggle, thoroughly smash the counter-revolutionary revisionist line that China's Khrushchev promoted in the construction of political power; criticize conservatism, and resolutely fight against old habits and forces, bravely break out of the old organizational framework, and build the Revolutionary Committees into truly revolutionary, vigorous, and powerful battle command centers.

XINHUA NEWS AGENCY, ZHENGZHOU, July 19 - After the Yinchuan County Revolutionary Committee implemented the revolutionization of the leading cadre team, streamlined and reduced bureaucracy, and maintained close ties with the masses, and the important editorial note by the People's Daily was published, it sparked the most enthusiastic response among the members of various levels of Revolutionary Committees in Henan Province, as well as among revolutionary cadres and revolutionary masses. In recent days, the Henan Provincial Revolutionary Committee, as well as various districts (cities) and counties across the province, have held meetings to seriously study the experience of Yinchuan and the editorial note of the People's Daily. Many places and units have formulated measures to further streamline and reduce bureaucracy. Members of various levels of Revolutionary Committees across the province have expressed their determination to further implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, take Yinchuan County as an example, do a good job in cleaning up the class ranks, take the path of streamlining and reducing bureaucracy, and consolidate and develop the great achievements of the Cultural Revolution from an organizational perspective.

Many Revolutionary Committee members in various places in Henan pointed out during the study that the important editorial note by the People's Daily on the experience of Yinchuan conveyed the voice of the great leader Chairman Mao and the orders of the Proletarian Headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin. This is the greatest concern, encouragement, support, and exhortation for the 50 million revolutionary people of Henan. Through serious study, everyone has a deeper understanding that, following the teachings of the great leader Chairman Mao, genuinely implementing streamlining and reducing bureaucracy, and organizing a revolutionary leading cadre team that is connected with the masses, this is of great significance for implementing Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, carrying out the struggle against the enemy, smashing the attempts of the class enemy to restore capitalism, overcoming bureaucratic old habits, promoting the revolutionary great unity of the two factions, and consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat. Everyone expressed their determination to follow the example of Yinchuan County and resolutely take the path of streamlining and reducing bureaucracy.

During the process of studying the experience of Yinchuan, members of various levels of Revolutionary Committees reviewed Chairman Mao's teachings: "The imperialists and domestic reactionaries will not readily accept their defeat; they will make their last struggles," and "Never forget class struggle." Everyone has a deeper understanding that implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions and streamlining and reducing bureaucracy is a sharp and profound class struggle. A handful of traitors, spies, unrepentant capitalist-roaders, and untransformed landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists will inevitably interfere and sabotage from various aspects. Members of various levels of Revolutionary Committees expressed their determination to use the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, fully mobilize and rely on the broad masses of the people, intensify class struggle, deeply carry out the revolutionary great criticism, thoroughly smash the counter-revolutionary revisionist line that China's Khrushchev promoted in the construction of political power, establish Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, wage a people's war to clean up the class ranks and implement streamlining and reducing bureaucracy, and thoroughly smash all the tricks and conspiracies of a handful of class enemies who attempt to sabotage and overthrow the newly born Revolutionary Committees.

Chairman Mao taught: "The status quo and habits often bind people's minds tightly, even revolutionaries sometimes cannot escape this." After serious and earnest study, many Revolutionary Committee members in various places in Henan decided to follow Chairman Mao's teachings of "breaking first, then establishing," fully carry forward the thorough revolutionary spirit of the proletariat, criticize conservatism, and resolutely fight against old habits and forces, bravely break out of the old organizational framework, and build the newly born Revolutionary Committees into truly revolutionary, vigorous, and powerful battle command centers.

After seriously studying the experience of Yinchuan County, many Revolutionary Committee members and revolutionary cadres and masses across the province took immediate action, swiftly formulated measures, and implemented them. Many places, due to the thorough criticism of the counter-revolutionary revisionist line that China's Khrushchev promoted in the construction of political power, greatly enhanced people's understanding of the great significance of streamlining and reducing bureaucracy, promoted the revolutionary transformation of cadres' thinking, and drove organizational revolution. After studying the experience of Yinchuan, the Revolutionary Committee of the Xinyang Region left only 40 staff members in the committee office, while the rest were all sent to the grassroots level to strengthen the front line. The Revolutionary Committees at various levels in the Luoyang Region, following Chairman Mao's teaching of "believing in and relying on the masses," mobilized the masses to carry out great debates, criticism, and denunciation, and launched a revolutionary great criticism against the counter-revolutionary revisionist line that China's Khrushchev promoted in the construction of political power. Many factory Revolutionary Committees reduced the number of staff to less than one-third of the original, established a new revolutionary style, and both revolution and production presented a prosperous new situation.

At present, various levels of Revolutionary Committees in Henan Province are further deeply studying the experience of Yinchuan County and the important editorial note of the People's Daily, determined to make the experience of Yinchuan blossom and bear fruit across the province, and strive forward in the direction of "organizing a revolutionary leading cadre team that is connected with the masses."

    进一步落实毛主席的最新指示　坚决走精兵简政的道路
    河南省各级革委会认真学习灵宝经验
    决心狠抓阶级斗争，大破中国赫鲁晓夫在政权建设方面所推行的反革命修正主义路线；批判保守主义，同旧的习惯势力进行坚决的斗争，勇敢地跳出原来旧机构的圈子，把革委会建成真正革命化的、朝气蓬勃的、精悍有力的战斗指挥部
    新华社郑州十九日电　河南省灵宝县革命委员会实行领导班子革命化，精兵简政，密切联系群众的经验和《人民日报》的重要编者按发表以后，在河南省各级革命委员会成员和广大革命干部、革命群众中，激起了最热烈的反响。连日来，河南省革命委员会以及全省各专区（市）县的各级革委会，纷纷举行会议，认真学习灵宝经验和《人民日报》编者按，许多地方和单位的革委会订出了进一步实行精兵简政的措施。全省各级革委会成员表示，一定要进一步落实毛主席的最新指示，以灵宝县为榜样，做好清理阶级队伍的工作，走精兵简政的道路，从组织上巩固和发展无产阶级文化大革命的伟大成果。
    河南省许多地方的革委会成员在学习中指出，《人民日报》就灵宝经验发表的重要编者按，传达了伟大领袖毛主席的声音，传达了以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的号令，这是对河南省五千万革命人民的最大关怀，最大鼓舞，最大支持，最大鞭策。经过认真的学习，大家更加深刻地认识到，遵照伟大领袖毛主席的教导，切切实实地实行精兵简政，组织起革命化的联系群众的领导班子，这对于贯彻执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，开展对敌斗争，粉碎阶级敌人复辟资本主义的企图，克服官僚主义旧习气，促进两派革命群众组织的革命大联合，巩固无产阶级专政，都具有重大的意义。大家表示，一定要象灵宝县那样，坚定不移地走精兵简政的道路。
    各级革委会成员在学习灵宝经验的过程中，重温了毛主席的“帝国主义者和国内反动派决不甘心于他们的失败，他们还要作最后的挣扎”和“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的教导。大家更加深切地认识到，落实毛主席的最新指示，实行精兵简政，是一场尖锐、深刻的阶级斗争。一小撮叛徒、特务、死不改悔的走资派，没有改造好的地、富、反、坏、右分子，必然要从多方面进行干扰和破坏。各级革委会成员表示，一定要以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，充分发动和依靠广大人民群众，狠抓阶级斗争，深入开展革命的大批判，大破中国赫鲁晓夫在政权建设方面所推行的反革命修正主义路线，大立毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，打好一场清理阶级队伍和实行精兵简政的“人民战争”，彻底粉碎一小撮阶级敌人妄想破坏和颠覆新生的革命委员会的一切阴谋诡计。
    毛主席教导说：“现状和习惯往往容易把人们的头脑束缚得紧紧的，即使是革命者有时也不能免。”河南省许多地方的革委会成员经过严肃认真的学习，决心遵循毛主席的“破字当头，立在其中”的教导，充分发扬无产阶级的彻底革命精神，批判保守主义，同旧的习惯势力进行坚决的斗争，勇敢地跳出原来的旧机构的圈子，把新生的革委会建设成为真正革命化的、朝气蓬勃的、精悍有力的战斗指挥部。
    全省许多地方的各级革委会成员和广大革命干部、革命群众认真学习了灵宝县的经验以后，闻风而动，雷厉风行，积极地找差距，订措施，落实于行动。不少地方由于认真开展了对中国赫鲁晓夫在政权建设方面所推行的反革命修正主义路线的大批判，大大提高了人们对精兵简政的伟大意义的认识，促进了广大干部的思想革命化，带动了组织革命化。信阳地区革委会学习了灵宝的经验以后，革委会机关除留下四十名工作人员外，其余全部放到基层，加强第一线。洛阳地区各级革委会遵照毛主席“要相信和依靠群众”的教导，放手发动群众开展大鸣、大放、大辩论，对中国赫鲁晓夫在政权建设方面所推行的反革命修正主义路线展开了革命的大批判。许多工厂的革委会把办事人员减少到不足过去的三分之一，树立了崭新的革命作风，革命和生产都出现了欣欣向荣的新局面。
    目前，河南省各级革委会正在更加深入地学习灵宝县的经验和《人民日报》的重要编者按，决心让灵宝经验在全省开花结果，使各级革委会朝着“组织起一个革命化的联系群众的领导班子”的方向奋勇前进。
