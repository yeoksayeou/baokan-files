The New Zealand Communist Party's organ, the "People's Voice" weekly, recently published an article condemning the Soviet revisionist renegade clique's recent act of servility in allowing an American aircraft loaded with invading U.S. troops in Vietnam to leave. The article strongly denounces the Soviet revisionist clique's true surrender to American imperialism and false support for the Vietnamese people.

The article states that this incident has made the Soviet revisionist clique's boasts about supporting the workers of various countries, especially the workers of socialist North Vietnam, into an even greater joke! The article points out that the Soviet revisionist clique is eager to help the American war machine, not the Vietnamese people.

The article states that the Soviet revisionist clique often speaks very beautifully about supporting the Vietnamese people. "However, their actions show that their friendship and loyalty are actually reserved for American imperialism."

After exposing the various conspiracies that the U.S. and the Soviet revisionists are plotting and implementing together to suppress the liberation struggles of the peoples of various countries, the article points out that the people of the world are increasingly seeing that the Soviet revisionists are the number one accomplice of American imperialism. The fact that the Soviet revisionists are now serving American imperialism's aggression against Vietnam will make people even more convinced of this.

    揭露苏修奴颜婢膝放走美机为美帝侵越战争效劳
    新华社十八日讯　新西兰共产党机关报《人民之声》周报最近就苏修叛徒集团不久前奴颜婢膝地放走一架满载侵越美军的美国飞机一事发表文章，强烈谴责苏修集团对美帝国主义真投降，对越南人民假支持的叛徒行径。
    文章说，这一事件使苏修集团吹嘘的支持各国的工人，特别是支持社会主义越南北方工人的所谓“保证”成了更大的笑柄！文章指出，苏修集团热衷于帮助的是美国的战争机器，而不是越南人民。
    文章说，苏修集团经常说一些支持越南人民的非常动听的话。“但是，他们的行动表明，他们的友谊和忠诚实际上是留给美帝国主义的。”
    文章在揭露美帝和苏修正在一起策划和实施的镇压各国人民解放斗争的种种阴谋之后指出，全世界人民越来越看清楚，苏修是美帝国主义的头号帮凶。苏修这次为美帝国主义侵略越南效劳的事实，将使人们更加相信这一点。
