The broad masses of cadres at Yongledian Farm in Tong County, Beijing, were greatly inspired and educated after viewing the oil painting "Chairman Mao Goes to Anyuan." Everyone was filled with joy and excitement as they praised the great significance of this painting. They unanimously agreed that one of the distinctive features of this painting is that it depicts our great leader Chairman Mao's consistent practice of going among the masses, believing in the masses, relying on the masses, fully mobilizing the masses to make revolution, and maintaining close ties with the masses.

Chairman Mao teaches us, "The most fundamental aspect of reforming state organs is to connect with the masses." Some members and staff of the farm revolutionary committee, facing this painting, looked up at the lofty and great image of Chairman Mao and engaged in heated discussions. They examined their past shortcomings in going among the masses and connecting with the masses, and resolved to carry forward the Party's style of maintaining close ties with the masses and to forever follow Chairman Mao's revolutionary path. Zhang Lianze, a member of the farm revolutionary committee and the head of the Hai Village revolutionary committee, was deeply moved after seeing the painting "Chairman Mao Goes to Anyuan." That night, as he lay on the kang (bed), he tossed and turned, thinking about how Chairman Mao cared so deeply for the working people and was so close to the hearts of the masses. Forty-six years ago, Chairman Mao, dressed in coarse cloth, wearing cloth shoes, and holding an old umbrella, braved hardships and dangers to walk to Anyuan for the liberation of the downtrodden people. Chairman Mao, without hesitation, went down into the mines, lived in workers' quarters, and had heart-to-heart talks with the workers, spreading revolutionary ideas, igniting the flames of revolution, and mobilizing the masses to make revolution. Chairman Mao is truly the people's beloved leader. He thought about himself and realized that although he had done some work for the Party over the years since liberation, he had not done enough to follow Chairman Mao's call to maintain close ties with the masses. He realized that whether or not one can carry forward the Party's style of maintaining close ties with the masses is a matter of loyalty to Chairman Mao and loyalty to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Therefore, he and other members of the revolutionary committee decided to use the oil painting "Chairman Mao Goes to Anyuan" and the "July 1" editorial "Carry Forward the Party's Style of Maintaining Close Ties with the Masses" from the two newspapers and one magazine as study materials, to hold a Mao Zedong Thought study class, and to mobilize the masses to give them feedback and suggestions.

Since the establishment of the revolutionary committee, Shi Changhou, the head of the machinery station revolutionary committee, had developed a sense of complacency and was reluctant to go among the masses and listen to their opinions. As a result, the masses had complaints about him, and he himself had some grievances, even requesting a transfer at one point. After seeing the painting "Chairman Mao Goes to Anyuan" and studying the "July 1" editorial "Carry Forward the Party's Style of Maintaining Close Ties with the Masses," he followed Chairman Mao's great teachings, examined his own style of work, and felt more and more ashamed and uneasy. Therefore, he actively went among the masses, sought out those who had complaints about him, had heart-to-heart talks with them, and examined his own shortcomings and mistakes, thus winning the approval of the masses.

Believing in the masses, relying on the masses, and fully mobilizing the masses are the fundamental starting points for all our Party's work and the concentrated expression of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. After viewing the painting, the broad revolutionary cadres of Yongledian Farm resolved to follow the instructions of our great leader Chairman Mao, to walk the path that Chairman Mao has walked, and to carry forward the Party's style of maintaining close ties with the masses. They unanimously declared, "Even if our positions change, our style of maintaining close ties with the masses will never change."

    走毛主席走过的路
    北京市通县永乐店农场　张世光
    永乐店农场的广大干部，看了《毛主席去安源》的油画后，受到了极大的鼓舞和教育。大家怀着幸福的激情，传颂着这幅油画的伟大意义。他们一致认为：这幅油画的特色之一，就是画出了我们伟大领袖毛主席一贯深入群众，相信群众，依靠群众，充分发动群众闹革命，和群众保持密切联系的作风。
    毛主席教导我们说：“国家机关的改革，最根本的一条，就是联系群众。”参加场革委会全体会议的部分委员和工作人员，面对这幅油画，仰望着毛主席的崇高伟大的形象，进行了热烈的讨论。他们检查了过去深入群众、联系群众不够的缺点，决心发扬党的紧密联系群众的作风，永远跟着毛主席走革命化的道路。场革委会委员、海字村革委会主任张连泽同志，看了《毛主席去安源》这幅油画以后，心情久久不能平静。晚上他躺在炕上翻来复去地想，毛主席他老人家是那么样地关心劳动人民，和人民群众心连心。四十六年前，他老人家身穿粗布衣，脚穿布便鞋，手拿旧雨伞，为了天下受苦人的解放，不畏艰难险阻，徒步走到安源去。毛主席不辞辛苦，下矿井，住工棚，和工人同志促膝谈心，宣传革命的道理，点燃革命的烈火，发动群众起来革命。毛主席真是咱革命人民的贴心人。他联想到自己，解放几年来，虽然为党做了一点工作，但是，同毛主席倡导的要紧密联系群众，自己还做得很差很差。他认识到能不能发扬党的紧密联系群众的作风，是忠不忠于毛主席的问题，是忠不忠于毛主席革命路线的问题。于是，他和革委会其他同志一起研究，决定以《毛主席去安源》的油画和两报一刊的“七一”社论《发扬党的紧密联系群众的作风》作为学习内容，办一期毛泽东思想学习班，发动群众给自己提意见，给革委会提意见。
    机务站革委会主任石长厚，自革委会成立以后，开始滋长了骄傲自满情绪，不愿深入群众，虚心听取群众的意见也少了。因此，群众对他有意见，他自己也有情绪，曾一度要求调动工作。看了《毛主席去安源》这幅油画，学习了“七一”社论《发扬党的紧密联系群众的作风》后，按照毛主席的伟大教导，联系自己的思想作风，他越想越惭愧，越想越不安。于是，他主动地到群众中去，找原来对他有意见的同志谈心，并检讨了自己的缺点错误，因而得到了群众的欢迎。
    相信群众，依靠群众，放手发动群众，是我们党一切工作最基本的出发点，是毛主席革命路线的集中表现。永乐店农场的广大革命干部，看了油画后，决心遵照伟大领袖毛主席的指示，走毛主席走过的路，发扬党的紧密联系群众的作风。他们一致表示：“地位变了，紧密联系群众的作风永远不能变。”
