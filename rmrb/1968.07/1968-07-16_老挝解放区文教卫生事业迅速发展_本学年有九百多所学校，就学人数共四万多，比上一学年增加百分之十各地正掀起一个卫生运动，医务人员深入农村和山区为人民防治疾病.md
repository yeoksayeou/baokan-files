This school year, there are over nine hundred schools, with a total of over forty thousand students, an increase of ten percent compared to last year. A health campaign is currently underway in various regions, with medical personnel going deep into rural and mountainous areas to prevent and treat diseases among the people.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Khamkeut, July 13th: The people of the Lao Liberation Zone, who are fighting on the front lines of the anti-American struggle, have, under the leadership of the Lao Patriotic Front, highly carried forward the revolutionary spirit, overcome numerous difficulties, and achieved remarkable results in the development of education and health.

During the 1967-1968 school year, the Lao Liberation Zone had over nine hundred ordinary schools, with a total of forty-one hundred students, an increase of ten percent compared to the previous school year. A notable feature of this school year is the significant increase in the number of female students and minority students.

Xiengkhouang Province is the most developed in terms of education in the liberation zone. Currently, the entire province has over three hundred and sixty teachers and over eleven thousand five hundred students. The number of students has increased by twenty percent compared to the previous school year.

The education sector in Vientiane Province has also seen significant development, with the current number of students increasing by forty percent compared to the previous school year.

In the liberation zones of the southern provinces where the fighting is intense, the broad masses of teachers and students have carried forward the spirit of hard work and perseverance, ensuring the normal conduct of teaching work, and the number of students has also increased.

To promote the development of education, the central education departments have successively opened middle and primary school teacher training classes. So far, the Central Normal School has trained four hundred and thirty teachers, making an active contribution to the development of education in the Lao Liberation Zone.

In recently liberated areas such as Nam Bak in Vientiane Province, Muang Xay in Houaphan Province, and Luanamtha in Saravane Province, education has been promptly restored and developed. In just half a year, the education department of Vientiane Province has established four schools in Nam Bak, providing over three hundred school-age children with the opportunity to study.

Currently, the people of the Lao Liberation Zone are launching a widespread literacy campaign, with the masses teaching and learning from each other, achieving significant results.

To boost the people's fighting spirit and production enthusiasm, the central and provincial cultural and art troupes, as well as film projection teams, have been tirelessly traveling to the front lines and various regions, performing for the broad masses and soldiers.

The health sector in the Lao Liberation Zone has also seen significant development. Currently, the number of medical personnel in the southern liberation zone has increased fivefold compared to 1966, and the number of hospitals and clinics has increased fourfold. Among them, there are seventeen well-equipped hospitals and clinics.

The central and provincial health departments pay great attention to expanding the ranks of medical workers and establishing more hospitals and clinics. The health department of Houaphan Province built two hospitals last year and established a clinic in every county. Xiengkhouang Province built two hospitals this year and trained over three hundred nurses for various regions within the province.

Currently, various regions in the liberation zone are launching a health campaign. Medical personnel are going deep into rural and mountainous areas, preventing and treating diseases among the people, and actively promoting health knowledge, helping the people improve environmental and household hygiene.

    据新华社康开十三日电　战斗在反美斗争第一线的老挝解放区人民，在老挝爱国战线党的领导下，高度发扬革命精神，克服了重重困难，在发展文教、卫生事业方面取得了显著的成绩。
    在一九六七——一九六八学年里，老挝解放区有九百多所普通学校，就学人数共四万零一百多名，比上一个学年增加了百分之十。这个学年的特点是，女学生和少数民族学生的人数有了显著的增加。
    桑怒省是解放区教育事业最发达的一个省份。目前，全省有三百六十多名教师和一万一千五百多名学生。学生人数比上一学年增加了百分之二十。
    琅勃拉邦省的教育事业也有了很大的发展，目前的学生人数比上一个学年增加了百分之四十。
    在战斗激烈的下寮各省解放区，广大师生发扬艰苦奋斗的精神，使教学工作得到正常进行，学生人数也有所增加。
    为了促进教育事业的发展，中央教育部门接连开办了中小学师资培训班。到目前为止，中央师范学校已培养出四百三十名教师，为发展老挝解放区的教育事业作出了积极的贡献。
    刚刚获得解放的琅勃拉邦省的南博、川圹省的芒岸、沙拉湾省的寮岸等地，教育事业也及时地得到恢复和发展。在短短的半年时间里，琅勃拉邦省教育部门就在南博建立了四所学校，使三百多名适龄儿童获得就学机会。
    目前，老挝解放区的人民正在掀起广泛的扫盲运动，广大人民互教互学，取得了很大的成绩。
    为了鼓舞人民的战斗意志和生产热情，中央和各省、县的文工团、文工队和电影放映队不辞劳苦，跋山涉水，奔赴前线和深入各地，为广大群众和战士演出。
    老挝解放区的卫生事业也有了很大的发展。目前，下寮解放区的医务干部人数比一九六六年增加了五倍，医院和医疗站比一九六六年增加了四倍。其中设备完善的医院和医疗站就有十七所。
