We are filled with immense excitement as we repeatedly read aloud the latest directive from our great leader Chairman Mao: "Universities must be run. Here, I am mainly talking about technical and vocational universities which must be run. However, the term of schooling should be shortened, education must be revolutionized, and proletarian politics must take command. The path should be that of Shanghai Machine Tool Factory, which cultivates technical personnel from among workers. Students should be selected from among workers and peasants with practical experience, sent to school for a few years, and then returned to production practice."

Chairman Mao's latest directive has sentenced the bourgeois educational and scientific and technological lines of the Chinese Khrushchev to death. It is a battle program to carry the educational revolution to the end and is also the fundamental guideline for us to build our company into a Mao Zedong Thought school and better cultivate and temper successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause.

Theory linked with practice, intellectuals taking the path of integrating with workers and peasants—this is Chairman Mao's consistent thought. In the past, our company, following Chairman Mao's teaching that "successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause are produced in the struggle of the masses and grow up in the tempering of revolutionary storms and stresses," has, in the process of organizing cadres and soldiers to study and apply Chairman Mao Zedong Thought, placed great emphasis on implementing and carrying forward the good learning style of linking theory with practice advocated by Chairman Mao. We stress learning in class struggle, using in class struggle, and transforming one's worldview in class struggle to achieve ideological revolutionization. Especially in recent years, our company has successively recruited a batch of college and high school students, making this task even more important. Most of these newly enlisted soldiers come from poor peasant families and grew up singing "The East Is Red" and wearing red scarves. They love the Party and Chairman Mao, and their essence is good. However, as Chairman Mao said: "In class society, everyone lives in a certain class position, and all kinds of thoughts are inevitably stamped with the mark of class." Therefore, while they are nurtured by Mao Zedong Thought, they also receive the influence of bourgeois ideology through various channels. Especially in the 18 years since the founding of the nation, Chinese Khrushchev has promoted a counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line, which has inevitably left more or less a stamp of bourgeois ideology on their pure hearts, making them tainted with various bourgeois ideas such as seeking fame and fortune.

In view of this situation, our company's party branch, while organizing these soldiers to study Chairman Mao's works and helping them overcome various bourgeois ideas, consciously pairs them with worker and peasant soldiers as "red pairs," encouraging them to learn good thoughts and good styles from worker and peasant soldiers. A college student who enlisted in 1961 had picked up the bourgeois idea of despising labor in school and came to the army to strive for Party membership, then return to school to engage in scientific research. He brought a large bundle of scientific books to the army and spent all day poring over them. The party branch, in order to help him eradicate this bourgeois "stamp," assigned him to the kitchen as a cook, helping him gradually overcome the bourgeois idea of despising labor in the ordinary labor and plant the roots of the proletarian idea of loving labor and being willing to serve the people. After five years of tempering in the army, this comrade greatly improved his political and ideological awareness. When it came time for demobilization and assignment, he wrote six applications to the party branch, firmly refusing to return to the big city and requesting to go to the border to engage in agricultural production. He and 12 other comrades from the company settled down on the border, actively participated in agricultural production, enthusiastically propagated Mao Zedong Thought, and the masses praised them as "red seeds" spreading Mao Zedong Thought.

During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, our company also took advantage of the "three supports, two militaries" momentum, organizing cadres and soldiers to learn from workers and poor peasants, humbly learning from workers and poor peasants. We adopted the methods of "inviting in" and "going out," inviting workers and poor peasants to give bitter-sweet reminiscence reports and share their experiences of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, greatly promoting the ideological revolutionization of young soldiers.

Over the years, we have insisted on doing this, making batch after batch of young soldiers from schools grow rapidly in the crucible of the three great revolutionary struggles, arming their minds with Mao Zedong Thought. These comrades are firm soldiers in executing and defending Chairman Mao's military line in the army and are "red seeds" spreading Mao Zedong Thought when they go to the localities.

We deeply feel from the practice of building our company that whether intellectuals implement the integration with workers and peasants is not a simple issue or a general issue, but a major issue concerning what kind of successors to cultivate and what line to execute. It is a major issue concerning whether our country will change color and whether the proletarian dictatorship can be consolidated. In the future, we will implement Chairman Mao's great directive well in building our company. For new soldiers from schools, we will welcome them warmly and actively help them grow into strong proletarian revolutionary soldiers as soon as possible. In executing the "three supports, two militaries" tasks, we will help factories and schools seriously study, loyally execute, and resolutely implement Chairman Mao's latest directive, letting the invincible Mao Zedong Thought play an unparalleled role in the struggle to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

    培养革命接班人的根本途径
    沈阳部队某部“学习毛主席著作的模范红九连”
    我们怀着无比激动的心情，一遍又一遍地高声朗读了我们伟大领袖毛主席的最新指示：“大学还是要办的，我这里主要说的是理工科大学还要办，但学制要缩短，教育要革命，要无产阶级政治挂帅，走上海机床厂从工人中培养技术人员的道路。要从有实践经验的工人农民中间选拔学生，到学校学几年以后，又回到生产实践中去。”毛主席的这一最新指示，宣判了中国赫鲁晓夫的资产阶级教育路线和科学技术路线的死刑，是将教育革命进行到底的战斗纲领，也是我们把连队建设成毛泽东思想大学校，更好地培养和锻炼无产阶级革命事业接班人的根本指针。
    理论联系实际，知识分子走和工农兵相结合的道路，这是毛主席的一贯思想。过去，我们连遵照毛主席“无产阶级革命事业的接班人，是在群众斗争中产生的，是在革命大风大浪的锻炼中成长的”的教导，在组织干部和战士活学活用毛泽东思想的过程中，十分重视贯彻和发扬毛主席亲自倡导的理论联系实际的好学风，强调在阶级斗争中学，在阶级斗争中用，在阶级斗争中改造世界观，实现思想革命化。特别是近几年来，连队先后补进一批大中学生，更加重了这个任务。这些新入伍的战士，绝大多数出身于贫下中农家庭，是唱着“东方红”、戴着红领巾长大的。他们热爱党，热爱毛主席，本质是好的。但是，正如毛主席所说：“在阶级社会中，每一个人都在一定的阶级地位中生活，各种思想无不打上阶级的烙印。”因此，他们在受到毛泽东思想哺育的同时，也通过各种渠道受到资产阶级思想的影响。特别是建国十八年来，中国赫鲁晓夫推行了一条反革命修正主义教育路线，这就不能不或多或少地在他们纯洁的心灵上打上资产阶级思想的烙印，使他们沾染了诸如成名成家等剥削阶级的思想。
    针对这种情况，我们连党支部在组织这些战士学习毛主席著作，帮助他们克服形形色色的资产阶级思想的时候，有意识地让他们和工农战士结成“一对红”，启发他们从工农战士身上学习好思想和好作风。一九六一年入伍的一个大学生，在学校沾染上了轻视劳动的资产阶级思想，想到部队来争取入党，然后再回学校搞科学研究。他带着好大一捆科学书籍来到部队，成天钻在书堆里。党支部为了帮助他挖掉这个资产阶级的“烙印”，把他分配到炊事班当炊事员，帮助他在平凡的劳动中逐步地克服了轻视劳动的资产阶级思想，扎下了热爱劳动、甘当人民勤务员的无产阶级思想的根子。经过五年部队生活的锻炼，这个同志大大地提高了政治思想觉悟，在复员分配时，一连向党支部写了六份申请书，坚决不回大城市，要求到边疆参加农业生产。他和连里的其他十二名同志，一起在边疆安家落户后，积极参加农业生产，热情地宣传毛泽东思想，群众称赞他们是传播毛泽东思想的“红色种子”。
    在无产阶级文化大革命中，我们连又大借“三支”“两军”的东风，组织干部、战士拜工人、贫下中农为老师，虚心地向工人和贫下中农学习。我们采取“请进来”、“走出去”的办法，请工人和贫下中农作忆苦思甜的报告，介绍他们活学活用毛主席著作的体会，大大地促进了青年战士的思想革命化。
    几年来，我们坚持这样做，使一批批来自学校的青年战士，在三大革命斗争的熔炉里，用毛泽东思想武装了自己的头脑，迅速地成长起来。这些同志在部队是执行和捍卫毛主席建军路线的坚强战士，到地方是传播毛泽东思想的“红色种子”。
    我们从连队建设的实践中深深地体会到，知识分子实行不实行和工农兵相结合，不是个简单的问题，一般的问题，而是关系到培养什么样的接班人，执行什么路线的大问题，是关系到我们国家变不变颜色，无产阶级政权能不能巩固的大问题。今后，我们在建设连队中，要很好地贯彻落实毛主席的这一伟大指示。对于来自学校的新战士，既要热情欢迎，又要积极帮助，使他们更快地成长为坚强的无产阶级革命战士。在执行“三支”“两军”任务中，我们要帮助工厂、学校认真学习、忠实执行、坚决落实毛主席的最新指示，让战无不胜的毛泽东思想在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的斗争中发挥无比的威力。
