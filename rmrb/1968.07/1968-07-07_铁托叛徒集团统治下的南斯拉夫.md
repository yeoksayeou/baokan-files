Under the rule of the Tito renegade clique, Yugoslavia is essentially a capitalist country. A small privileged stratum rides roughshod over the people, reducing the broad masses of laborers to wage slaves once again, plunging them into a sea of misery and making them suffer untold hardships.

	Four hundred thousand people forced to seek livelihood abroad

Due to the contraction of domestic production, economic decline, and rising unemployment, large numbers of unemployed people are forced to seek work abroad. According to a report in the Yugoslavian "Battle" newspaper this March, there are currently 400,000 Yugoslavian laborers abroad. Among them, 140,000 are in West Germany, 60,000 in France, 50,000 in Austria, 20,000 in Sweden, 70,000 in Australia, and over 40,000 in New Zealand.

These Yugoslavians, forced to leave their homes and seek work abroad, are subjected to brutal exploitation by foreign capitalists. The Yugoslavian "Political" newspaper has revealed the miserable plight of some Yugoslavian workers in West Germany and Austria. It admits that the Yugoslavians employed there "have to work like mad," and "cannot catch their breath before the end of work and rest periods." The situation of "unskilled female workers is even more difficult." The newspaper also says: "In Munich, Frankfurt, Stuttgart, and other cities in West Germany, ... one often encounters some disgruntled Yugoslavians." "These people are destitute. They have no place to live," and have to sneak into "abandoned wooden shacks in the suburbs to spend the night."

Yet, even so, the Tito clique, in order to alleviate the severe unemployment problem at home, is still trying to sell more Yugoslavian labor to foreign capitalists. The chairman of the Yugoslavian Federal Labor Commission, Polajnar, recently openly stated that "the number of people going abroad should be increased."

	Beggars abound on the streets of Belgrade

In the streets and parks of Belgrade, the capital of Yugoslavia, one often sees many unemployed people and beggars with worried faces.

In a children's park, many unemployed people who have wandered from Macedonia and the highlands of Montenegro are crowded onto a dozen or so benches. Some are gnawing on a small piece of dry bread, with no place to stay, resting here. As soon as they see passersby, they swarm over, hoping to find some temporary work. Each time they are rejected, they disperse, dejected.

The Tito clique not only fails to provide these wandering unemployed people with a way out but also, in order to maintain "public order," has issued an order prohibiting the unemployed from sleeping on park benches, with a fine of 500 dinars for violators. The Tito clique is even more irritated by those who beg in the city center. The Serbian authorities not only "oppose begging" but also publicly warn people "not to give money to beggars," otherwise they will "be held responsible."

	Open encouragement for capitalists to set up private factories

Under the rule of the Tito renegade clique, Yugoslavia's so-called "socialist public ownership" economy has long degenerated into a capitalist economy. In recent years, private capitalist economic elements in Yugoslavian cities and countryside have been rampant. According to the figures provided by Yugoslavian officials, which are far smaller than the actual numbers, the total number of workers employed by private capitalists in Yugoslavia last year was 30,000.

In May this year, the Yugoslavian "Battle" newspaper openly reported that the first private woolen factory employing more than 100 workers in Yugoslavia is about to open. According to the report, this private factory is located in Slavonia's Orahovica and employs 120 workers. It was built with an investment of 2 million new dinars by four capitalists. To encourage the development of this private capitalist economy, the mouthpiece of the Tito renegade clique openly praises the "interests of this private factory and the interests of the Orahovica district in many ways are consistent." Therefore, the local authorities not only "provided the factory with a house and rent" but also "will provide the factory with certain tax concessions."

### 铁托叛徒集团统治下的南斯拉夫

    铁托叛徒集团统治下的南斯拉夫
    本报讯　铁托叛徒集团统治下的南斯拉夫，实质上是一个资本主义国家。一小撮特权阶层骑在人民头上作威作福，使广大劳动人民重新沦为被雇佣的奴隶，处于水深火热之中，苦不堪言。
                四十万人流落国外谋生
    南斯拉夫由于国内生产萎缩，经济凋蔽，失业激增，大批失业者被迫跑到国外去谋生。据南修《战斗报》今年三月间透露，目前流落在国外的南斯拉夫劳动者共达四十万人，其中有十四万人在西德，六万人在法国，五万人在奥地利，两万人在瑞典，还有七万人在澳大利亚，四万多人在新西兰。
    这些离乡背井流落在外的南斯拉夫人，受到了外国资本家的残酷剥削。南修《政治报》曾经透露过一些流落在西德和奥地利的南斯拉夫工人的悲惨状况。它承认，被雇佣的南斯拉夫人在那里“必须拚命干活”，“在工休和劳动时间结束之前休想喘口气”，那些“非熟练的女劳力的处境尤为艰难”。这家报纸还说：“在慕尼黑、法兰克福、斯图加特以及（西德）其他城市附近，……常常可以遇到一些情绪不佳的（南斯拉夫）人。”“这些人穷困潦倒。他们没有房子住”，不得不偷偷地到“郊区被人遗弃的木棚里去过夜”。
    但即使如此，铁托集团为了缓和国内的严重失业问题，还是竭力设法把更多的南斯拉夫劳动力出卖给外国资本家。南斯拉夫联邦劳动委员会主席波拉伊纳尔不久前公然表示，今后“到国外去的人数应当更多些”。
        贝尔格莱德街头乞丐多
    在南斯拉夫首都贝尔格莱德的街头和公园里，经常徘徊着许多愁眉不展的失业者和衣衫褴褛的乞丐。
    在一个儿童公园内，许多从马其顿、黑山高地流浪来的失业者，聚挤在十几条长椅上。有的啃着一小块干硬的面包，因为无处安身，在此歇息。他们一见到游人走过，就蜂涌而上，渴望能找点临时工做。每次遭到拒绝以后，又都垂头丧气地散去。
    铁托集团不但不设法为这些流浪的失业者安排生路，反而为了维持“市容”而通令禁止失业者在公园长椅上睡觉，违者就要罚款五百第纳尔。对于在闹市行乞的人，铁托集团更是恼火。塞尔维亚当局不但表示“反对行乞”，而且公开警告人们“不要对乞丐进行施舍钱物”，否则就要“追究责任”。
        公开鼓励资本家开设私营工厂
    在铁托叛徒集团的统治之下，南斯拉夫的所谓“社会主义全民所有制”经济，早已蜕化成为资本主义经济。近年来，南斯拉夫城乡的私人资本主义经济成分更是大肆泛滥。根据南斯拉夫官方人士透露的远为缩小了的数字，去年南斯拉夫私人资本家雇佣的工人总数已有三万人。
    今年五月间，南修《战斗报》公开报道了南斯拉夫第一家雇工百人以上的私营呢绒工厂即将开张的消息。据透露，这家私营工厂，建立在斯拉沃尼亚的奥拉霍维察，雇佣一百二十名工人。它是由四个资本家共同投资两百万新第纳尔兴建的。为了鼓励这种私人资本主义经济的发展，铁托叛徒集团的喉舌还公然宣扬这个私营工厂的“利益同奥拉霍维察区的利益在许多方面是吻合的”。因此，地方当局不但“向工厂提供了房子，给予租用”，而且“还将向工厂提供赋税上的某些优惠”。
