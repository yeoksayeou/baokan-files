	Electrical installation workers in Miami, USA, who were hired to set up television broadcasting equipment for the Republican Party's national convention, went on strike on July 20. This strike has caused serious difficulties for the convening of the convention.

	This year is a presidential election year in the United States, and the two major political parties, the Democratic Party and the Republican Party, which are tools of the monopoly capitalist class, are busily staging this electoral farce to continue deceiving the American people. The Republican Party is scheduled to hold its national convention in Miami, Florida, on August 6 to nominate its presidential candidate. The Democratic Party is also scheduled to hold its national convention in Chicago, Illinois, on August 26 to nominate its presidential candidate. The monopoly capitalist class in the United States, in order to launch a wave of propaganda to deceive the American people, is constructing large-scale radio and television broadcasting facilities for these two conventions.

	However, the monopoly capitalist class's plans have encountered serious setbacks from the American working class from the very beginning. The 11,800 electrical installation workers in Illinois have been on strike since May 8, and their strike has lasted for over 70 days, bringing the radio and television broadcasting facilities for the Democratic Party's convention to a complete standstill. Now, the electrical installation workers in Miami have also taken up the struggle, causing the Republican Party's convention to face difficulties.

    美国迈阿密市电气安装工人罢工
    新华社二十一日讯　华盛顿消息：为美国共和党在迈阿密市召开的全国代表大会安装电视报道工程的电气工人，二十日举行罢工，使得这个代表大会的召开面临严重的困难。
    今年是美国四年一次的总统选举年，美国的民主党和共和党这两个垄断资产阶级的工具，为了继续欺骗美国人民，正在紧锣密鼓地上演这一选举丑剧。共和党预定在八月六日在佛罗里达州的迈阿密市举行全国代表大会，提出共和党总统候选人。民主党也预定在八月二十六日在伊利诺斯州的芝加哥市举行全国代表大会，提出民主党的总统候选人。美国垄断资产阶级为了掀起一个欺骗美国人民的宣传浪潮，正在为这两个代表大会兴建大规模的无线电和电视报道的工程。
    但是，美国垄断资产阶级的如意算盘，一开始就遭到了美国工人阶级的严重打击。伊利诺斯州的一万一千八百名电气安装工人从五月八日起开始举行的大罢工已坚持了七十多天，使得民主党代表大会的无线电和电视报道工程全部陷于停顿。现在，迈阿密市的电气安装工人又奋起举行罢工，使得共和党的代表大会的召开也陷入了困境。
