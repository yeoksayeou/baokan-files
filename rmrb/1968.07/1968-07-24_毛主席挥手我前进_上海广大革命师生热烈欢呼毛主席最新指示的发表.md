Chairman Mao's latest directive, which holds great historical significance, states: "Universities must still be run, and I am mainly talking about universities of science and engineering. The school system should be shortened, education should be revolutionized, and proletarian politics should take command. Follow the path of Shanghai Machine Tool Factory in cultivating technical personnel from among workers. Select students from workers and peasants with practical experience, have them study in schools for a few years, and then return to production practice." This directive has sparked a strong response among the broad revolutionary teachers and students in Shanghai. In the past two days, all schools in Shanghai have been in high spirits, with the shouts of "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand ten thousand years!" echoing through the skies. The revolutionary teachers and students, with their boundless love and loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao and the proletarian revolutionary line of Chairman Mao, have held meetings and parades in droves. On the evening of the issuance of Chairman Mao's latest directive, one team after another, full of vigor, surrounded the giant portrait of Chairman Mao, holding high the placards with Chairman Mao's latest directive, beating drums and gongs, and surging from all directions towards Shanghai Machine Tool Factory. Revolutionary teachers and students from Shanghai Jiaotong University, Tongji University, Mechanical Engineering College, East China University of Chemical Technology, Shanghai University of Finance and Economics, Shanghai Drama Academy, and Shanghai Conservatory of Music sent big red congratulatory messages and resolutions to the workers of Shanghai Machine Tool Factory. Revolutionary teachers and students from Fudan University, University of Science and Technology, Fisheries College, and East China Normal University, with hearts full of excitement and joy, solemnly swore in front of the statue of Chairman Mao in the factory. Many middle school Red Guards from Shanghai also rushed to the factory at night to hold discussions with the workers. After more than two years of tempering in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the revolutionary teachers and students of Shanghai's colleges and universities deeply understand the great significance of Chairman Mao's latest directive. They enthusiastically cheer: Chairman Mao's latest directive is the battle program to carry the proletarian educational revolution through to the end, and it is a long-term plan to prevent revisionism. "Chairman Mao waves his hand and we advance!" They are determined to follow the great commander Chairman Mao, firmly walk the path of integrating with workers, peasants, and soldiers, and in this great struggle to smash the old bourgeois educational system and establish a new proletarian educational system, be pioneers and vanguards.

Thoroughly Criticize the Revisionist Educational Line of China's Khrushchev

In the past two days, the revolutionary teachers and students in Shanghai, with full political enthusiasm, have used Chairman Mao's latest directive as a sharp weapon to launch an extremely fierce and profound revolutionary criticism of China's Khrushchev's counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line. Many university students, after holding celebratory parades, immediately held criticism meetings to launch a fierce attack on China's Khrushchev and his agents in Shanghai who promoted the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line. The tide of revolutionary criticism is surging higher and higher in Shanghai's colleges and universities.

The revolutionary students who have been deeply harmed by the revisionist educational line have used their personal experiences to expose the crimes of China's Khrushchev's revisionist educational line. A group of students who had been selected from workers and peasants to enter the university in the past few years pointed out that under the care of the great leader Chairman Mao, a batch of worker and peasant students entered higher education after liberation. However, the clique of capitalist roaders within the party and the reactionary academic "authorities" of the bourgeoisie, who were madly promoting China's Khrushchev's counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line, on the one hand, suppressed and expelled these worker and peasant students from the school; on the other hand, they used the bourgeois reactionary worldview to corrupt these worker and peasant students, attempting to use the "dying pool" of revisionism to "dye" them into successors of the bourgeoisie. Therefore, without thoroughly smashing the old educational system, even if worker and peasant students enter the university, they will either be expelled or be cultivated into successors of the bourgeoisie. They said that Chairman Mao's directive that "the school system should be shortened, education should be revolutionized, and the phenomenon of bourgeois intellectuals dominating our schools can no longer continue" is truly great, wise, and correct.

A young teacher from the Physics Department of Fudan University, who came from a worker's background, denounced at the criticism meeting that in 1958, more than 400 students from workers and peasants, with revolutionary enthusiasm to make Chairman Mao proud and make the proletariat proud, entered the gates of Fudan University. However, these students soon suffered severe persecution from China's Khrushchev's counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line. The capitalist roaders and reactionary academic "authorities," from their reactionary standpoint, fabricated various excuses to expel these students batch by batch, until graduation, only less than a quarter remained.

Students from a class in the Architecture Department of Tongji University, after studying Chairman Mao's latest directive, further criticized the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line. The students in this class angrily denounced that in their first class at the school, the reactionary academic "authorities" spread the idea that "architecture is about cultivating engineers, not 'bricklayers,'" advocating that an architect should have the "philosopher's head," "musician's throat," "painter's eyes," and "poet's emotions" of the bourgeoisie, promoting the idea that "if you don't understand art, you don't understand enjoyment, you don't know what happiness is," advocating that architecture should follow the "foreign," "ancient," "strange," and "flying" path, making the class chaotic. The students in this class firmly stated that they would thoroughly criticize the revisionist educational line and the decadent bourgeois architecture, and firmly follow the path indicated by Chairman Mao to integrate with workers, peasants, and soldiers.

The revolutionary criticism of China's Khrushchev's counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line has raised the class struggle and two-line struggle awareness of the revolutionary teachers and students in Shanghai, further strengthening their love for Chairman Mao's proletarian educational line. Many revolutionary teachers and students also mentioned: Implementing Chairman Mao's latest directive and following the path of Shanghai Machine Tool Factory in cultivating technical personnel from among workers is a sharp class struggle. We cultivate a large number of proletarian intellectuals, which is a death sentence for those bourgeois gentlemen. They will not easily give up this position and will definitely struggle to the death. They will also fight with the proletariat again from the right or the "ultra-left" side. A small number of class enemies will also obstruct and sabotage from the right or the "ultra-left" side, and we must be seriously alert to this.

Firmly Follow the Path Indicated by Chairman Mao to Integrate with Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers

Under the care of the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, the revolutionary teachers and students of many schools in Shanghai have been exploring how to carry out the proletarian educational revolution and how to integrate with workers, peasants, and soldiers in the previous period. The issuance of Chairman Mao's latest directive has further inspired their fighting spirit.

The revolutionary teachers and students of Tongji University's "May 7th Commune," who have successfully carried out half a year of educational revolution exploration, said after studying Chairman Mao's latest directive: Chairman Mao's latest directive has thoroughly pronounced the death sentence on the old educational system and also depicted a complete picture of the magnificent cause of proletarian education. This is the battle program for our proletarian educational revolution. Although our "May 7th Commune" trial has only been a little over half a year, we have deeply felt that only by following the path of integrating with workers, peasants, and soldiers can we cultivate successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause, and there is no other path. In the past few days, the teachers and students of this commune have further summarized the revolutionary practice experience of the previous period based on Chairman Mao's latest directive and formulated the revolutionary practice plan for the next stage.

In the process of seriously studying Chairman Mao's latest directive, many schools' revolutionary teachers and students deeply felt: To implement Chairman Mao's latest directive, on the one hand, we must fight against class enemies, and on the other hand, we must also fight against the remnants of the revisionist educational line, the influence of bourgeois ideology, and old habits. We must carry out a fierce struggle between the proletarian "public" and the bourgeois "private" in our minds and thoroughly break with all old thoughts. We must implement Chairman Mao's latest directive in the struggle and firmly follow the path indicated by Chairman Mao 29 years ago in his brilliant work "The Direction of the Youth Movement": "All young intellectuals and student youths in the country must integrate with the broad masses of workers and peasants and become one with them."

On the day after the issuance of Chairman Mao's latest directive, the first batch of Red Guards revolutionary young fighters from the largest industrial area in Shanghai, Yangpu District, who went to the countryside to work, held a swearing-in ceremony before their departure. They solemnly swore to Chairman Mao: "With a red heart, we rush to the countryside to make a revolution. The great commander points the direction, and we will revolutionize to the end. We will definitely follow Chairman Mao's words, walk the path of integrating with workers, peasants, and soldiers, take up the revolutionary burden, and build a new socialist countryside with poor and lower-middle peasants into a great school of Mao Zedong Thought."

Liu Haode, a responsible person of the Red Guards of Shanghai's colleges and universities and a responsible person of the revolutionary committee of East China Normal University, was the first person in the school to sign up to go to the countryside to be an ordinary peasant for life. He said proudly: "The brilliant sunlight of Mao Zedong Thought further illuminates the educational front. Now, the proletarian educational revolution is even deeper. I have decided to go to the countryside, to the border, to take root and bloom there, and to settle down." He said: "The proletarian revolutionary faction is most loyal to the great leader Chairman Mao, most inseparable from Chairman Mao, and most inseparable from the broad masses of workers and peasants." Like Liu Haode, many Red Guards young fighters who have already taken up responsible positions in the revolutionary committees of colleges and universities have also enthusiastically taken the lead in signing up to go to the countryside and the border, determined to be like Comrade Deng Xiaoping, to be a cow for the people for life and to pull the revolutionary cart for life.

Quickly Catch Up with the Steady Steps of Hundreds of Millions of Revolutionary People

The latest directive of the great leader Chairman Mao and the rapid development of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution have deeply inspired the revolutionary students in Shanghai. They are determined to catch up quickly with the steady steps of hundreds of millions of revolutionary people, to make new contributions to carrying the educational revolution through to the end and to seize the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The revolutionary students in Shanghai deeply realized that as Chairman Mao taught: "Intellectuals, before they integrate with the revolutionary struggle of the masses and before they decide to serve the interests of the masses and integrate with them, often have subjective and individualistic tendencies, their thoughts are often empty, and their actions are often wavering." Young students must walk the path of integrating with workers, peasants, and soldiers. "Without a heart full of enthusiasm, without a decision to look down, without a desire to seek knowledge, and without the spirit of putting down one's arrogance and being a humble student, one will definitely not be able to do it and will definitely not be able to do it well." They deeply felt that the important editorial note of the People's Daily pointed out: "Advise those university students who look down on workers and peasants and think they are great to put down their arrogance and quickly catch up with the steady steps of hundreds of millions of revolutionary people." This sentence is a great encouragement to them. They said that they would definitely respond to the call of the great leader Chairman Mao, learn from the workers and poor and lower-middle peasants, and become a proletarian revolutionary faction determined to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

Inspired by Chairman Mao's latest directive, in the past two days, revolutionary students from East China Normal University, Shanghai Mechanical Engineering College, and other schools have invited old workers to the school to report their experiences of following the great leader Chairman Mao to make a revolution. The responsible person of the Red Guards of Shanghai Middle School specially went to the factory to learn from the workers' experience of carrying out revolutionary criticism. Some revolutionary students of Fudan University, when studying Chairman Mao's latest directive, took out the words of encouragement from the poor and lower-middle peasants when they studied in the advanced unit of actively learning and applying Mao Zedong Thought in Jiangsu Province Taicang County Hongjin Brigade, urging them to follow Chairman Mao's words and swear to carry the educational revolution through to the end and walk the path of integrating with workers, peasants, and soldiers. They said that this is the sincere expectation of the poor and lower-middle peasants for us, and we must always keep it in mind. We must follow the great path of proletarian educational revolution opened up by Chairman Mao, walk to the end, and be determined to set off a revolutionary hot wave of struggle-criticism-transformation on the educational front, constantly create revolutionary miracles that bourgeois mediocrities and right-wing conservatives cannot imagine, and be determined to thoroughly break with all old thoughts and old ideas of the exploiting classes, forging ourselves into a new generation of communists.

专栏：

    毛主席挥手我前进
    ——上海广大革命师生热烈欢呼毛主席最新指示的发表
  毛主席具有伟大历史意义的最新指示：“大学还是要办的，我这里主要说的是理工科大学还要办，但学制要缩短，教育要革命，要无产阶级政治挂帅，走上海机床厂从工人中培养技术人员的道路。要从有实践经验的工人农民中间选拔学生，到学校学几年以后，又回到生产实践中去。”在上海广大革命师生中激起了强烈的反响。这两天，上海的所有大中学校一片欢腾，“毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！”的欢呼声响彻云霄。广大革命师生怀着对伟大领袖毛主席和毛主席无产阶级革命路线的无比热爱、无比忠诚，纷纷举行集会和游行。在毛主席最新指示发表的当晚，一支又一支朝气蓬勃的队伍，簇拥着毛主席的巨幅画像，高擎着毛主席最新指示的语录牌，敲锣打鼓，从四面八方涌向上海机床厂。上海交通大学、同济大学、机械学院、华东化工学院、财经学院、上海戏剧学院、音乐学院的革命师生，向上海机床厂的工人，送来了大红喜报和决心书；复旦大学、科学技术大学、水产学院、华东师范大学的革命师生，以无比激动而兴奋的心情，在上海机床厂厂内的毛主席塑像前庄严宣誓；上海许多中学的红卫兵小将也连夜赶到机床厂，和工人一起开座谈会。经过两年多无产阶级文化大革命锻炼的上海大中学校的革命师生，深刻地理解毛主席最新指示的伟大意义。他们热烈欢呼：毛主席的最新指示是把无产阶级教育革命进行到底的战斗纲领，是反修防修的百年大计。“毛主席挥手我前进！”他们决心紧跟伟大统帅毛主席，坚定地走和工农兵相结合的道路，在这场摧毁旧的资产阶级教育制度、创立新的无产阶级教育制度的伟大斗争中，做闯将，当先锋。
    彻底批判中国赫鲁晓夫的修正主义教育路线
    两天来，上海广大革命师生，满怀饱满的政治热情，以毛主席的最新指示为锐利武器，对中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义教育路线，开展了极其猛烈、极其深刻的革命大批判。许多大学的革命学生在举行庆祝游行以后，就立即举行批判会，对中国赫鲁晓夫及其在上海的代理人所推行的反革命修正主义教育路线猛烈开火。革命大批判的浪潮，在上海的大专院校里正在一浪高一浪地向前发展。
    深受修正主义教育路线毒害的广大革命学生，以自己的亲身经历，控诉了中国赫鲁晓夫修正主义教育路线的罪恶。一批在过去几年从工农中选拔进大学的革命学生指出，在伟大领袖毛主席的关怀下，解放后一批批工农学生进入了高等学校。但是，疯狂推行中国赫鲁晓夫反革命修正主义教育路线的党内一小撮走资派和资产阶级的反动学术“权威”，对于进入大学的工农学生，一方面是排挤、打击，最后踢出校门；一方面用资产阶级反动世界观对这些工农学生进行腐蚀，妄图用修正主义的“大染缸”，把他们“染”成资产阶级的接班人。因此，不彻底摧毁旧的教育制度，工农学生即使进了大学，也会或者被踢出，或者被培养成为资产阶级的接班人。他们说，毛主席所指示的
  “学制要缩短，教育要革命，资产阶级知识分子统治我们学校的现象，再也不能继续下去了”，真是无比伟大，无比英明，无比正确。
    复旦大学物理系一位工人出身的青年教师在批判会上控诉说，一九五八年有四百多个来自工农的学生，怀着为毛主席争气，为无产阶级争气的革命志气，跨进了复旦大学的大门，但想不到这些学生接着就遭受到中国赫鲁晓夫反革命修正主义教育路线的严重迫害。走资派和反动学术“权威”，从他们自己的反动立场出发，制造种种借口，把我们这些学生一批一批踢出校门，到最后毕业的时候，只剩下了不到四分之一。
      同济大学建筑系一个班级的革命学生学习了毛主席的最新指示，进一步批判了反革命修正主义教育路线。这个班级的学生愤怒地控诉说，我们进学校的第一课，反动学术“权威”就大肆散布什么“建筑学就是培养工程师，不是培养‘泥水匠’”，宣扬一个建筑师要有资产阶级的“哲学家的头脑”，“音乐家的喉咙”，“画家的眼睛”，“诗人的感情”，鼓吹“不懂艺术，不懂享受，就不知道什么是幸福”，宣扬建筑要走“洋”、“古”、“怪”、“飞”的道路，把一个班级搞得乌烟瘴气。这个班级的学生们坚决表示，要彻底批判修正主义的教育路线和资产阶级腐朽的建筑学，坚决地走毛主席指引的与工农兵结合的道路。
    对中国赫鲁晓夫反革命修正主义教育路线的革命大批判，提高了上海广大革命师生的阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟，更加增强了他们对毛主席无产阶级教育路线的热爱。许多革命师生还谈到：落实毛主席最新指示，走上海机床厂从工人中培养技术人员的道路，这是一场尖锐的阶级斗争。我们培养出大批的无产阶级知识分子，就是宣判了那些资产阶级老爷们的死刑。他们是不会轻易放弃这个阵地的，必然要作垂死挣扎，他们还会再同无产阶级较量一番。一小撮阶级敌人，也会从右的或极“左”方面进行阻挠和破坏，这一点应该引起我们的严重警惕。
    坚决走毛主席指引的和工农兵结合的道路
    在以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的关怀下，上海许多学校的革命师生在前一时期，按照毛主席的教育思想，对怎样进行无产阶级教育革命，怎样走和工农兵相结合的道路，进行着努力的探索。毛主席最新指示的发表，进一步激励了他们的战斗热情。
    已经成功地进行了半年教育革命探索的同济大学“五·七”公社革命师生，学习了毛主席的最新指示后，深有体会地说：毛主席的最新指示彻底宣判了旧教育制度的死刑，并且为我们描绘出一幅完整的无产阶级教育事业的宏伟图景。这是我们无产阶级教育革命的战斗纲领。我们“五·七”公社的试点虽然才短短半年多，但我们已深深体会到，只有走和工农兵相结合的道路，才能培养出无产阶级革命事业的接班人，其他的道路是没有的。这几天，这个公社的师生根据毛主席的最新指示，进一步总结了前一段革命实践的经验，制定了下一阶段革命实践的规划。
    在认真学习毛主席最新指示的过程中，许多学校的革命师生深刻地体会到：要贯彻执行毛主席的最新指示，一方面要同阶级敌人进行斗争，同时也要同修正主义教育路线的流毒、资产阶级思想影响和旧习惯势力进行斗争。一定要在自己头脑里开展一场无产阶级的“公”字和资产阶级的“私”字的激烈搏斗，要彻底和一切旧思想决裂。要在斗争中贯彻执行毛主席的最新指示，坚决走毛主席二十九年前在《青年运动的方向》这篇光辉著作中所指引的道路：“全国知识青年和学生青年一定要和广大的工农群众结合在一块，和他们变成一体”。
    就在毛主席最新指示发表的第二天，上海最大工业区杨浦区首批赴农村务农的红卫兵革命小将，举行了出发前的誓师大会，他们向毛主席庄严宣誓：“怀着一颗火红心，奔赴农村干革命，伟大统帅指方向，革命到底不变心。我们坚决听毛主席的话，走与工农兵相结合的道路，把革命的重担挑起来，同贫下中农一道，把社会主义的新农村建设成为毛泽东思想的大学校。”
    上海大专院校红代会负责人、华东师范大学革命委员会负责人刘浩德，是在学校里第一个报名下乡当一辈子普通农民的革命小将。他豪迈地说：“毛泽东思想的灿烂阳光进一步照亮了教育阵地。现在，无产阶级教育革命更加深入了。我下定决心到农村去，到边疆去，在那里生根开花，安家落户。”他说：“无产阶级革命派最忠于伟大领袖毛主席，最最离不开毛主席，最最离不开广大工农兵群众。”象刘浩德一样，已经担任了大中学校革命委员会负责人的许多红卫兵小将，都满怀革命激情地带头报名到农村去，到边疆去，决心象门合同志那样，做一辈子人民的牛，拉一辈子革命的车。
    迅速赶上亿万革命人民前进的步伐
    伟大领袖毛主席的最新指示，无产阶级文化大革命迅猛发展的大好形势，深深激励着上海广大的革命学生。他们决心急起直追，迅速赶上亿万革命人民前进的雄伟步伐，为把教育革命进行到底，为夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利，立新功。
    上海的革命学生深刻地认识到，正如毛主席所教导的：“知识分子在其未和群众的革命斗争打成一片，在其未下决心为群众利益服务并与群众相结合的时候，往往带有主观主义和个人主义的倾向，他们的思想往往是空虚的，他们的行动往往是动摇的”，青年学生要走和工农兵相结合的道路，“没有满腔的热忱，没有眼睛向下的决心，没有求知的渴望，没有放下臭架子、甘当小学生的精神，是一定不能做，也一定做不好的。”他们深深体会到，《人民日报》重要编者按指出的：“奉劝那些轻视工农、自己以为很了不起的大学生放下架子，迅速赶上亿万革命人民前进的雄伟步伐”这句话，是对自己的极大鞭策。他们表示，一定要坚决响应伟大领袖毛主席的号召，向工人阶级和贫下中农学习，做一个决心把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底的无产阶级革命派。
    在毛主席最新指示的鼓舞下，这两天，华东师范大学、上海机械学院等学校的革命学生，都把老工人请到学校里，请他们报告自己紧跟伟大领袖毛主席闹革命的体会。上海中学红代会的负责人，专门到工厂学习工人开展革命大批判的经验。复旦大学一些革命学生在学习毛主席最新指示的时候，拿出了前一时期他们在活学活用毛泽东思想先进单位江苏省太仓县洪泾大队学习时，贫下中农勉励他们听毛主席的话，誓把教育革命进行到底，走与工农兵相结合的道路的临别赠言。他们说，这是贫下中农对我们的殷切期望，我们要永远铭记心头。我们一定要沿着毛主席开辟的无产阶级教育革命的伟大航道走下去，走到底，决心在教育战线上掀起斗批改的革命热潮，不断地创造出为资产阶级庸人和右倾保守主义者所意想不到的革命奇迹，决心同一切剥削阶级的旧思想旧观念作最彻底的决裂，把自己锤炼成为共产主义的一代新人。
