In the face of heavy blows from the People's Liberation Armed Forces in South Vietnam, the number of South Vietnamese puppet soldiers deserting or defecting to the people's side is increasing. The Saigon puppet regime, facing a dire situation, is frantically drafting soldiers, desperately recruiting cannon fodder, and their evil deeds are met with strong opposition from the broad masses in the enemy-occupied areas.

According to reports, the South Vietnamese puppet "Minister of Defense," Nguyen Van Thieu, recently admitted in a significantly understated figure that in recent years, the number of deserters from the puppet army has been around 700,000 annually, nearly 10% of the current military strength.

Another report indicates that in the first half of June this year, over a hundred puppet soldiers deserted in the province of Kien Giang alone. On July 11, the puppet soldiers at the Ba Den outpost in this province, in collaboration with the local people and the People's Liberation Armed Forces, staged a mutiny, eliminating many puppet military officers within the outpost and carrying away a large amount of weapons and ammunition to join the People's Liberation Armed Forces. In the province of Soc Trang, a large number of puppet soldiers also defected to the people in June. On June 6, over 400 students from the puppet military academy in Go Dau, Gia Dinh province, broke through the enemy's strict control and collectively escaped.

As the number of casualties and deserters in the puppet army continues to rise, the puppet military is severely short of manpower, and many units cannot be fully staffed. In a desperate attempt to prolong their existence, the Saigon puppet regime has recently been frantically drafting soldiers, even expanding the conscription age to 43, and even teachers and public officials are not spared. This has sparked strong dissatisfaction and opposition from the broad masses and youth in the enemy-occupied areas. According to reports, the Executive Committee of the Saigon University Student Union and other organizations recently issued statements and notices, opposing the Saigon puppet government's forced conscription into the puppet army, and denouncing the treacherous crimes of the Nguyen Van Thieu-Nguyen Cao Ky clique.

    南越伪军每年有七万人开小差
    西贡傀儡集团为挽救败局拚命拉伕遭人民反对
    据新华社河内电　在越南南方人民解放武装力量的沉重打击下，南越伪军士兵开小差或弃暗投向人民的越来越多。兵源枯竭的西贡傀儡集团为挽救败局，正在加紧抓丁拉伕，大肆收罗炮灰，它们的罪恶行径遭到敌占区广大人民的强烈反对。
    据报道，南越伪“国防部长”阮文维最近透露的显然是大大缩小了的数字承认，近年来伪军开小差的每年有七万人，差不多占现有兵力的百分之十。
    另据报道，今年六月上半月，仅在金瓯省就有一百多名伪军士兵开小差逃跑。这个省巴登据点的伪军士兵，七月十一日在人民解放武装力量和当地人民的配合下举行起义，消灭据点内许多伪军军官，携带大批武器弹药投向人民解放武装力量。在朔庄省，六月份也有大批伪军士兵向人民投诚。嘉定省守德伪军官学校的四百多名学生，六月六日冲破敌人的严密控制，集体逃跑。
    随着伪军在战场上大量伤亡和逃跑人数与日俱增，伪军兵力严重不足，许多建制无法拼凑满额。为了进行垂死挣扎，西贡傀儡当局最近拚命抓丁拉伕，甚至把征兵年龄扩大到四十三岁，连教师、公职人员也不能幸免。这激起了敌占区广大人民和青年的强烈不满和反对。据报道，西贡大学生总会执行委员会等组织最近分别发表声明和通告，反对西贡伪政权强迫他们参加伪军，并控诉阮文绍—阮高其集团的卖国罪行。
