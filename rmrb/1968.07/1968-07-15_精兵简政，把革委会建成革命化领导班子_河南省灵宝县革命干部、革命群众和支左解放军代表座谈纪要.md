Chairman Mao has taught us: "The basic experience of the revolutionary committees is threefold: one is the representation of revolutionary cadres, one is the representation of the military, and one is the representation of revolutionary masses, achieving the three-in-one combination of revolution. The revolutionary committees should implement unified leadership, break down overlapping administrative structures, streamline and reduce bureaucracy, and organize a revolutionary leadership team that is connected to the masses."

The experience of Lingbao County Revolutionary Committee in "implementing the revolutionization of the leadership team, streamlining and reducing bureaucracy, and closely connecting with the masses" has spread throughout the country. The revolutionary cadres, revolutionary masses, and PLA support personnel in Lingbao County have been greatly inspired. In recent days, they have repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions on the construction of revolutionary committees and his teachings on "streamlining and reducing bureaucracy," and have seriously studied the important editorial note in the People's Daily. At a discussion meeting held by a reporter from this newspaper, representatives from the three sides discussed the great significance of "streamlining and reducing bureaucracy" and expressed their determination to resolutely advance along the path indicated by Chairman Mao!

An Extremely Important Policy

Liu Shangxiu (Director of the County Revolutionary Committee, former First Secretary of the County Committee):
The great leader Chairman Mao has long taught us that "streamlining and reducing bureaucracy" is "an extremely important policy of the Party." At this critical moment of achieving a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, Chairman Mao pointed out: "The revolutionary committees should implement unified leadership, break down overlapping administrative structures, streamline and reduce bureaucracy, and organize a revolutionary leadership team that is connected to the masses." Through this period of practice, we have come to understand that the reason why streamlining and reducing bureaucracy is "an extremely important policy" is that it relates to the fundamental issue of what flag the newly born revolutionary committees should raise, what path they should take, and what line they should adhere to.

Due to the long-term implementation of the counter-revolutionary revisionist line by the Chinese Khrushchev and a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party in the construction of political power, the old Lingbao County Committee and County People's Committee had a very bloated structure, with many redundant personnel, and were seriously detached from the masses. The great Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has sentenced the Chinese Khrushchev and a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party to death, and the new revolutionary political power—the Lingbao County Revolutionary Committee—has been born! Should the newly born revolutionary committee follow the old ways and establish a cumbersome and bloated structure, or should it dare to break away from the old structure and establish a streamlined and revolutionary structure? In a word, should we implement "streamlining and reducing bureaucracy"? The essence of this question is whether to eliminate the poison of the counter-revolutionary revisionist line implemented by the Chinese Khrushchev in the construction of political power and whether to firmly adhere to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

Recalling the period of the Anti-Japanese War, in the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region, our county committee had only about ten people; even in the early days of liberation, our county committee also had only about ten people. At that time, transportation and communication were inconvenient, and we often had to rely on our own two legs to get things done, but the work was done very well. This also proves that we should follow Chairman Mao's instructions and resolutely take the path of "streamlining and reducing bureaucracy."

We have connected our past experiences and lessons, mobilized the masses extensively, investigated the harm of the old bloated structure, discussed the benefits of "streamlining and reducing bureaucracy," and summarized the "five harms and five benefits." Chairman Mao's teachings and past experiences and lessons have raised our awareness and resolved us to implement this extremely important policy throughout the construction of our revolutionary committee.

Liu Hongyan (Deputy Director of the County Revolutionary Committee, PLA Representative):
The great leader Chairman Mao pointed out as early as 1942: "Since the Central Committee of the Party proposed the policy of streamlining and reducing bureaucracy, many anti-Japanese base areas have, according to the instructions of the Central Committee, planned and carried out this work.... However, some comrades in some base areas have not carried out this work seriously due to insufficient understanding. These comrades still do not understand the relationship between streamlining and reducing bureaucracy and the current situation and various policies of the Party, and have not regarded streamlining and reducing bureaucracy as an extremely important policy." Chairman Mao's great teachings have enlightened us. The new revolutionary political power should be a "revolutionary and mass-connected" command center, full of vigorous fighting spirit, "united, tense, serious, and lively," decisive, and quick to act. If it is bloated and top-heavy, it will not be able to move, will not understand the situation below, and will not see the problems clearly. This will weaken the dictatorship of the proletariat and will not be able to play the role of the new revolutionary political power.

After our county revolutionary committee implemented streamlining and reducing bureaucracy, the situation has changed dramatically, and revolution and production have seen new leaps. The facts have powerfully proven that implementing streamlining and reducing bureaucracy, establishing a revolutionary and combat-ready organization, and achieving the "five goals" of "simplification, unity, efficiency, economy, and anti-bureaucratism" taught by Chairman Mao, can better implement Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and consolidate and develop the great achievements of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in terms of organization.

A Fundamental Measure to Closely Connect with the Masses

Cui Kuanxin (Deputy Director of the County Revolutionary Committee, former Deputy County Magistrate):
Chairman Mao teaches us: "The most fundamental aspect of the reform of state organs is to connect with the masses." From several months of practice, we have deeply felt that streamlining and reducing bureaucracy is a fundamental measure for the revolutionary committee to closely connect with the masses. To closely connect with the masses, we must firmly establish the ideology and style advocated by Chairman Mao of believing in the masses, relying on the masses, and being willing to be a student of the masses, while also reducing the size of the power structure and taking the path of "streamlining and reducing bureaucracy."

Overlapping structures are very harmful to the state and the people. The old county committee and county people's committee had a bloated structure with many layers. Such an old structure had many redundant personnel and low efficiency; the leadership was high above, detached from reality and the masses, and cultivated the evil habit of being an official and a lord, fostering a wasteful, idle, and lazy attitude. The most serious thing was that under the control of a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, Chairman Mao's instructions and the voice of the proletarian headquarters could not reach the masses.

After the establishment of the county revolutionary committee, streamlining and reducing bureaucracy has made a big difference. The current county revolutionary committee has a small leadership team, few staff, and high work efficiency. The revolutionary committee has become a battle command center that highlights proletarian politics and closely connects with the masses. Chairman Mao's voice and the policies of the Party Central Committee can be transmitted downwards in the most timely and accurate manner, directly reaching the masses and quickly turning into the conscious actions of the broad masses of the people.

After implementing streamlining and reducing bureaucracy, the comrades working in the revolutionary committee, according to Chairman Mao's teaching of "being both an official and a commoner," have jumped out of the bureaucratic circle and gone to the front line, humbly learning from the masses, listening to the opinions of the masses, timely understanding the situation, solving problems, and discovering and vigorously supporting new things. In this way, the revolutionary committee has deeply rooted itself among the masses, truly representing the interests of the masses. At the same time, we often hear the criticisms of the masses and accept the supervision of the masses, which has strongly promoted our ideological revolutionization.

Zhang Wanying (Deputy Director of the County Revolutionary Committee, former Director of the County Committee's Propaganda Department):
After streamlining and reducing bureaucracy, there are fewer people and more tasks, and some comrades are always worried about not being able to do a good job. I think the key is what to focus on. If you only focus on grain, cotton, and oil, without distinguishing between friends and enemies, the more people there are, the worse the work will be. Moreover, it depends on how to do it. If proletarian politics are not highlighted and the mass line is not followed, no matter how many people there are, it will not work; if proletarian politics are highlighted and the masses are fully trusted and relied upon, fewer people will do the work better. One of the purposes of our implementation of streamlining and reducing bureaucracy is to better mobilize the broad revolutionary masses to care about and manage state affairs. As long as we firmly rely on the masses and fully mobilize the masses, things will be done better.

Now it seems that with fewer people in the revolutionary committee, it will prompt us to concentrate our energy on the fundamentals, adhere to arming the masses with Mao Zedong Thought, and make us pay more attention to relying on the masses and following the mass line. Through practice, we have deeply felt that: "The masses are the true heroes." Mao Zedong Thought grasped by the masses becomes a great material force. The broad poor and lower-middle peasants listen to Chairman Mao the most, they are the smartest and most talented. As long as we adhere to mobilizing the positive factors of the masses with Mao Zedong Thought, we can create miracles and overcome all difficulties.

After streamlining and reducing bureaucracy, our relationship with the office staff has also become closer. Now, we do everything ourselves, from fetching water to sweeping the floor and taking notes. The masses feel very close to us. In daily work, except for major issues that are collectively studied, general issues can be solved by general cadres. This has broken the past philosophy of layer-by-layer reporting for both big and small matters, fully mobilized the enthusiasm of general cadres, and better played their role.

Tan Bingwu (Staff of the Office Group of the County Revolutionary Committee, former general cadre of the County Committee):
The style of the revolutionary committee is very different from that of the old county committee. In the past, although we were "small officials," we had a lot of officialdom. Because the old structure was bloated and complicated, there were many layers, and the words of general cadres did not count, some people pushed and pressed many tasks, and kicked the ball around. It was really difficult for the masses to solve a problem! In the past, we also rarely went to the masses, and even when we went down, we were only as companions to the leading cadres.

After streamlining and reducing bureaucracy, we have abandoned the old style and established a new revolutionary style. Take our office group, for example, with only seven people, we have to handle three major tasks: grasp the movement, grasp the center, and handle letters and visits from the masses. Through practice, we have gradually worked out a relatively good working method: two people are stationed, that is, they participate in the work of a production brigade or commune; two people run the surface, often go to various communes and brigades to walk around, learn from the masses, and grasp the situation. The rest of the comrades stay at home to receive and handle letters and visits from the masses. We seven people meet regularly, exchange information, summarize the situation, and analyze and study. This way of doing things combines points and surfaces and has achieved relatively good results.

Zhang Chengcai (Leader of the Revolutionary Masses Organization in Chengcun Commune):
Our commune is a remote place in the county. In the past, the county's leading cadres just sat in the office and lived by attending meetings and listening to reports. They rarely came once or twice a year, and when they came, they just took a quick look and left. The responsible persons of the current county revolutionary committee are different. They often go to the front line, immerse themselves among the masses, live with us, study with us, and discuss state affairs. We need such revolutionary leading cadres who are closely connected with the masses, not the past "official lords" who are detached from the masses.

Not long after the establishment of the Chengcun Commune Revolutionary Committee, a handful of class enemies fiercely stirred up the wind of reversing cases. At the most intense moment of class struggle, when we felt the most difficult, Comrade Liu Shangxiu, the director of the county revolutionary committee, came to our commune. He carefully understood the situation from us, helped us set up a Mao Zedong Thought study class, and firmly grasped class struggle, leading the masses to repel the enemy's attack. The poor and lower-middle peasants in our commune all said: The county revolutionary committee has done a great thing for us. What's good about it? It's good that they timely brought us Mao Zedong Thought and armed our minds. This is the good result of streamlining and reducing bureaucracy and implementing the revolutionization of the leadership team.

Promote the Spirit of Thorough Revolution, Advance Along the Path Indicated by Chairman Mao

Liu Hongyan:
The path we have taken to implement streamlining and reducing bureaucracy is not smooth. It has experienced sharp and profound struggles between the two classes, the two lines, the two roads, and the two ideologies. We have fought against the class enemies, fought against the old ideas and styles of the exploiting class, and fought against the "selfish" bourgeois ideology in our own minds. The class enemies have used every means to sabotage and obstruct our implementation of streamlining and reducing bureaucracy and have launched various vicious attacks against us. At this critical moment, we reviewed Chairman Mao's teachings: "If the enemy opposes us, that's good, that means we have drawn a clear line with the enemy. If the enemy vigorously opposes us, slanders us, and says we are worthless, that's even better, that means not only have we drawn a clear line with the enemy, but it also means that our work has achieved great results." This has further strengthened our determination to implement streamlining and reducing bureaucracy.

In our implementation of streamlining and reducing bureaucracy, if there is any experience, the most fundamental one is: Chairman Mao waves his hand, and we advance. With Mao Zedong Thought, we can overcome all enemies, overcome all difficulties, and break through all obstacles and resistance.

Wang Weiying (Member of the Standing Committee of the County Revolutionary Committee, former Deputy Director of the County Committee's Office):
Chairman Mao teaches us: "Without destruction, there can be no construction." "With destruction as the main task, construction is also within it." To implement streamlining and reducing bureaucracy, we must thoroughly criticize the counter-revolutionary revisionist line implemented by the Chinese Khrushchev in the construction of political power and criticize conservatism, daring to jump out of the old structure. Therefore, we must promote the thorough revolutionary spirit of the proletariat.

Implementing streamlining and reducing bureaucracy is a profound social revolution, not something that a few people can achieve by staying in a room and coming up with a plan. We must mobilize the masses and fight against various obstacles. Our new structure of the revolutionary committee is the result of following the mass line and launching a mass movement.

Qiang Xinxing (Worker of the Henan West Machinery Factory):
Chairman Mao teaches us: "The growth of any new thing is bound to be fraught with difficulties and twists and turns." "We cannot assume that a new system, once established, is completely consolidated. That is impossible. It needs to be gradually consolidated." In implementing streamlining and reducing bureaucracy, in addition to the class enemies' sabotage, the old ideas, old styles, and old habits have also been interfering and impacting. We must have a full understanding of this. The revolutionary committee is a new thing that has emerged in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and is our lifeline. We, the working class and the broad masses of the people, cherish it like our own eyes and defend it. At the same time, we must follow Chairman Mao's teachings, constantly summarize experiences, promote achievements, correct shortcomings. We must oppose the theory of stagnation and gradually consolidate, develop, and perfect the new revolutionary political power in the struggle.

× × ×

The discussion meeting lasted for several hours, and everyone eagerly shared their insights, creating a very lively atmosphere. Finally, the comrades who participated in the discussion said: Our work of streamlining and reducing bureaucracy has just taken the first step, and the tasks ahead are still very arduous. We must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, seriously implement Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, humbly learn from the advanced units' experiences, and build the revolutionary committees at all levels in Lingbao County into "revolutionary leadership teams that are connected to the masses."

    精兵简政，把革委会建成革命化领导班子
  　——河南省灵宝县革命干部、革命群众和支左解放军代表座谈纪要
    毛主席教导我们：“革命委员会的基本经验有三条：一条是有革命干部的代表，一条是有军队的代表，一条是有革命群众的代表，实现了革命的三结合。革命委员会要实行一元化的领导，打破重叠的行政机构，精兵简政，组织起一个革命化的联系群众的领导班子。”
    灵宝县革命委员会“实行领导班子革命化，精兵简政，密切联系群众”的经验传遍全国。灵宝县的广大革命干部、革命群众和解放军支左人员受到了极大的鼓舞。连日来，他们一次又一次地反复学习毛主席关于革命委员会建设的最新指示和“精兵简政”的教导，认真学习《人民日报》的重要编者按。在本报记者召开的座谈会上，这三方面的代表畅谈了“精兵简政”的伟大意义，并表示决心，坚决沿着毛主席指引的道路阔步前进！
        一个极其重要的政策
    刘尚修（县革委会主任，原县委第一书记）：
    伟大领袖毛主席早就教导我们，“精兵简政”是党的“一个极其重要的政策”。在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的关键时刻，毛主席又指出：“革命委员会要实行一元化的领导，打破重叠的行政机构，精兵简政，组织起一个革命化的联系群众的领导班子。”经过这一段时间的实践，我们体会到，精兵简政之所以是“一个极其重要的政策”，就是因为它关系到新生的革命委员会举什么旗，走什么路，坚持什么路线这样一个大问题。
    由于中国赫鲁晓夫等党内一小撮走资派，长期以来在政权建设方面推行反革命修正主义路线，旧灵宝县委和县人委的机构十分庞大，人浮于事，严重脱离群众。伟大的无产阶级文化大革命运动，宣判了中国赫鲁晓夫等党内一小撮走资派的死刑，新生的革命政权——灵宝县革命委员会诞生了！新生的革命委员会，是因循守旧，建立庞杂臃肿的机构呢，还是破字当头，勇敢地跳出原来旧机构的圈子，建立一个精干的革命化的机构？一句话，就是要不要实行“精兵简政”？这个问题的实质，就是要不要肃清中国赫鲁晓夫在政权建设方面推行的反革命修正主义路线的流毒，是不是坚定不移地执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。
    回想抗日战争时期，在晋冀鲁豫边区，我们一个县委会不过十来个人；就是解放初期，我们的县委会也是十几个人。那时候，交通和通讯都不方便，办什么事经常是靠自己迈开两腿走，可是工作搞得很好。这也证明了，我们应当遵照毛主席的指示，坚决走“精兵简政”的道路。
    我们联系过去的经验教训，广泛发动群众，大查原来臃肿的旧机构的危害，大议“精兵简政”的好处，总结出“五害五好”。毛主席的教导，过去的经验教训，使大家提高了认识，下定决心，把“精兵简政”这项极其重要的政策，贯串于我们革命委员会建设的始终。
    刘鸿雁（县革委会副主任，解放军代表）：
    伟大领袖毛主席早在一九四二年就指出：“自从党中央提出精兵简政这个政策以来，许多抗日根据地的党，都依照中央的指示，筹划和进行了这项工作。……但是还有若干根据地的同志们因为认识不够，没有认真地进行。这些地方的同志们还不理解精兵简政同当前形势和党的各项政策的关系，还没有把精兵简政当作一个极其重要的政策看待。”毛主席的伟大教导，使我们心明眼亮。新生的革命政权，应该是“革命化的联系群众的”指挥部，应当充满着旺盛的战斗精神，
  “团结、紧张、严肃、活泼”，雷厉风行，说干就干。如果一身臃肿，头重脚轻，势必机器开不动，下情不清楚，问题看不准。这就会削弱无产阶级专政，不能发挥新生革命政权的作用。
    我们县革委会实行精兵简政以后，面貌焕然一新，革命和生产出现了新的飞跃。事实有力地证明，实行精兵简政，建立一个革命化、战斗化的机构，达到毛主席所教导的“精简、统一、效能、节约和反对官僚主义五项目的”，才能更好地贯彻执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，从组织上巩固和发展无产阶级文化大革命的伟大成果。
      紧密联系群众的根本措施
    崔宽心（县革委会副主任，原副县长）：
    毛主席教导我们：“国家机关的改革，最根本的一条，就是联系群众。”从几个月的实践中，我们深刻地体会到：精兵简政，是革命委员会紧密联系群众的根本措施。要密切联系群众，必须牢固树立毛主席一贯倡导的相信群众、依靠群众、甘当群众小学生的思想和作风，同时要把政权机构缩小，走“精兵简政”的道路。
    机构重叠，对国家、对人民危害很大。旧县委、旧县人委机构臃肿，层次重叠。那样的旧机构，人浮于事，效率很低；领导高高在上，脱离实际，脱离群众，养成做官当老爷的恶习，助长了铺张浪费、游手好闲、好逸恶劳的大少爷作风。最严重的是，在党内一小撮走资派的控制下，毛主席的指示和无产阶级司令部的声音不能与群众见面。
    县革命委员会成立以后，实行了精兵简政，情况就大不一样了。现在的县革命委员会，领导班子小，办事人员少，工作效率高。革命委员会成了突出无产阶级政治，密切联系群众的战斗指挥部。毛主席的声音、党中央的方针政策，都能最及时最准确地传达下去，直接与群众见面，迅速变成广大人民群众自觉的行动。
    实行精兵简政以后，在革命委员会工作的同志根据毛主席“既当‘官’，又当老百姓”的教导，跳出事务圈子，走上第一线，虚心向群众学习，倾听群众的意见，及时了解情况，解决问题，发现新生事物大力扶持。这样，就使革委会深深扎根于群众之中，真正代表群众的利益。同时，使我们经常听到群众的批评，接受群众的监督，有力地促进了我们的思想革命化。
    张万盈（县革委会副主任，原县委宣传部长）：
    精兵简政以后，人少事多，有些同志总是担心工作抓不好。我认为，关键在于抓什么。只抓粮棉油，不问敌我友，人越多，工作就会抓得越糟。另外，就要看怎么抓法。如果不突出无产阶级政治，不走群众路线，人再多也不管用；如果突出无产阶级政治，充分相信群众，依靠群众，人少会把工作搞得更好。我们实行精兵简政，其中一个目的就是为了更好地发动广大革命群众关心和管理国家大事。只要坚决依靠群众，充分发动群众，事情就会办得更好。
    现在看来，革委会人员少了，就会促使我们集中精力狠抓根本，坚持用毛泽东思想去武装群众，促使我们更加注意依靠群众，走群众路线。通过实践，我们体会最深的是：“群众是真正的英雄”。毛泽东思想掌握了群众，就变成巨大的物质力量。广大贫下中农最听毛主席的话，他们最聪明，最有才能。只要我们坚持用毛泽东思想调动群众的积极因素，就能创造出人间奇迹，什么困难都能克服。
    精兵简政以后，我们和机关工作人员的关系也更密切了。现在，我们自己动手打水，扫地，作记录，什么都干，群众感到很亲切。日常工作中，除重大问题集体研究外，一般性的问题一般干部就可以解决。这样就破除了过去那种无论大事小事，一律层层请示的烦琐哲学，充分调动了一般干部的积极性，更好地发挥了他们的作用。
    谭丙武（县革委会办事组工作人员，原县委机关一般干部）：
    县革委会与旧县委的作风就是大不一样。过去，我们这些人虽然“官”小，但是官气不小。因为旧机构重叠庞杂，层次很多，一般干部讲了话不能算数，有些人对许多工作能推就推，能压就压，互相踢皮球。群众要解决一个问题，可真难啊！过去，我们也很少到群众中去，就是下去了，也只是作为领导干部的陪伴。
    精兵简政以后，抛弃了旧的作风，树立了崭新的革命作风。就拿我们这个办事组来说吧，一共七个人，就要办三件大事：抓运动，抓中心，处理群众来信来访。通过实践，我们逐步摸索出一套比较好的工作方法：两个人蹲点，即到一个生产大队或公社参加工作；两个人跑面，经常到各公社、大队走一走，看一看，向群众学习，掌握情况。其他的同志在家里接待处理群众来信来访。我们七个人定期碰头，互通情报，汇总情况，分析研究。这样做，点面结合，收到了比较好的效果。
    张成才（程村公社革命群众组织负责人）：
    我们公社是县里一个偏僻的地方。过去，县里的领导干部光坐办公室，靠开会听汇报过日子。他们难得来一、二次，来也是转一圈就走。今天的县革委会负责人却不一样了。他们经常走上第一线，深入群众之中，跟我们住在一起，同我们一起学习，讨论国家大事。我们就是要这样密切联系群众的革命领导干部，不要过去那样的脱离群众的“官老爷”。
    我们程村公社革委会成立不久，一小撮阶级敌人大刮翻案妖风。正当阶级斗争最激烈，我们感到最困难的时候，县革委会主任刘尚修同志来到我们公社。他详细地向我们了解了情况，帮助我们办起了毛泽东思想学习班，狠抓阶级斗争，领导群众打退了阶级敌人的进攻。我们公社的贫下中农都说：县革委会帮助我们办了件大好事。好在哪里？好在他们及时地给我们送来了毛泽东思想，武装了我们的头脑。这都是精兵简政，实行领导班子革命化的好结果。
    发扬彻底革命精神，沿着
    毛主席指引的道路前进
    刘鸿雁：
    我们实行精兵简政所走过的这一段道路，是不平坦的。它经历了尖锐、深刻的两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线、两种思想的斗争。我们与阶级敌人斗，与剥削阶级的旧观念、旧作风斗，与自己头脑中的资产阶级“私”字斗。阶级敌人千方百计地破坏和阻挠我们实行精兵简政，对我们进行了种种恶毒的攻击。在这关键时刻，我们重温了毛主席的教导：“如若被敌人反对，那就好了，那就证明我们同敌人划清界线了。如若敌人起劲地反对我们，把我们说得一塌糊涂，一无是处，那就更好了，那就证明我们不但同敌人划清了界线，而且证明我们的工作是很有成绩的了。”这就更加坚定了我们实行精兵简政的决心。
    我们实行精兵简政，如果说有什么经验，最根本的一条就是：毛主席挥手我前进。有了毛泽东思想，就能压倒一切敌人，战胜一切困难，破除一切阻力和反抗。
    王维英（县革委会常委，原县委办公室副主任）：
    毛主席教导我们：“不破不立。”“破字当头，立也就在其中了。”要实行精兵简政，就要彻底批判中国赫鲁晓夫在政权建设方面所推行的反革命修正主义路线，批判保守主义，勇敢地跳出旧机构的圈子。因此，要发扬无产阶级的彻底革命精神。
    实行精兵简政，是一场深刻的社会革命，不是几个人关在屋子里提个方案所能奏效的，必须放手发动群众，同各色各样的阻力作斗争。我们革委会建立的新机构，就是走群众路线、大搞群众运动的结果。
    强新喜（豫西机械厂工人）：
    毛主席教导我们说：“任何新生事物的成长都是要经过艰难曲折的。”“不能认为新制度一旦建立起来就完全巩固了，那是不可能的。需要逐步地巩固。”实行精兵简政，除了阶级敌人要进行破坏之外，旧的观念、旧的作风、旧的习惯势力，一直也在干扰和冲击。对于这一点，我们要有充分的认识。革命委员会是无产阶级文化大革命运动中出现的新生事物，是我们的命根子。我们工人阶级和广大人民群众象爱护自己的眼珠一样爱护它，保卫它。同时，我们还要遵照毛主席的教导，不断地总结经验，发扬成绩，纠正缺点。我们要反对停止的论点，在斗争中逐步巩固、发展、完善新生的革命政权。
                ×　×　×
    座谈会开了几个小时，大家争先恐后地畅谈体会，会场气氛十分热烈。最后，参加座谈的同志们说：我们的精兵简政工作刚刚迈出第一步，今后的任务还很艰巨。我们一定要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，认真落实毛主席的一系列最新指示，虚心学习先进单位的经验，把灵宝县各级革命委员会建设成“革命化的联系群众的领导班子”。　本报记者
