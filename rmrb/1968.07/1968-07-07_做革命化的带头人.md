Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: Politics is the commander, it is the soul. "Political work is the lifeline of all economic work." This is the only correct direction for us to consolidate the collective economy and develop agricultural production. However, the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents openly sing a different tune, claiming that material incentives and piecework are "necessary," and that without rewards and extra money, production cannot be carried out. The revisionist trash peddled by the Chinese Khrushchev is widespread and harmful, and it must be thoroughly eliminated.

Before the Four Cleanups movement, the cadres of our Hongshimen were influenced by the revisionist line of the Chinese Khrushchev, and they promoted material incentives and piecework for a period, taking a detour. At that time, cadres assigned work by first setting the piecework points. At the end of the year, they always wanted to see more money. In a few years, a small village of a few dozen households accumulated a deficit of over 7,000 yuan.

In the autumn of 1965, the People's Liberation Army brought the red revolutionary books and the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. The cadres studied Chairman Mao's teachings: "The capitalist tendencies among the rich peasants are serious. As long as we relax political work among the peasants in the process of cooperation, and even in a long period thereafter, capitalist tendencies will emerge." Everyone contrasted Mao Zedong's teachings with the road they had taken in the past few years, the more they remembered, the more painful and regretful they felt, and they couldn't help but shed tears. In the struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines, the cadres deeply felt that Mao Zedong Thought is the most precious treasure, and they could not do without it for a moment. Following Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought is victory; leaving Chairman Mao and deviating from Mao Zedong Thought would lead to the capitalist road. From then on, the cadres took the lead in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, took the lead in emphasizing politics, and took the lead in carrying out ideological transformation.

During the first Spring Festival after the construction of the Dam at Jian Gou, all the community members were on holiday. However, all the cadres, party members, and a part of the young activists of the entire brigade did not rest, nor did they go from door to door to pay New Year's visits. Instead, they sat together and reviewed the brilliant works of Chairman Mao. Everyone said, in the past, we promoted material incentives and piecework, and we almost slid into the revisionist path. Today, we must take the lead in emphasizing proletarian politics, take the lead in carrying out ideological transformation, and take the lead in walking the bright path indicated by Chairman Mao. Thus, everyone broke with old customs, picked up tools, and went to the big ditch to build a dam and engage in voluntary labor. The community members were deeply moved by the revolutionary actions of the cadres and followed suit. In one day, they built a dam that was three zhang long and five chi wide. This was not only the first flood-prevention dam built in the barren valley, but more importantly, it built a "public" dam in people's minds.

In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, our Hongshimen Brigade saw the widespread promotion of Mao Zedong Thought, the great proliferation of the proletarian "public" spirit, the great development of collective production, and the great increase in public accumulation. We not only made up for the past deficits but also accumulated over 10,000 yuan in public funds.

Emphasizing politics is the fundamental direction for running a socialist collective economy. In developing the collective economy, we do not rely on piecework or material incentives. We rely entirely on Mao Zedong Thought, entirely on political and ideological work, and entirely on the ideological transformation of people. The Chinese Khrushchev is a stumbling block to socialism, and we must kick him away. We will always emphasize proletarian politics and march forward on the socialist path indicated by Chairman Mao.

    做革命化的带头人
    平谷县红石门大队
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：政治是统帅，是灵魂。“政治工作是一切经济工作的生命线。”这是我们巩固集体经济，发展农业生产唯一正确的方向。可是，中国赫鲁晓夫和他的代理人，却公开大唱反调，胡说什么物质刺激、工分挂帅“是必要的”，不搞奖励，不加点钱，生产就搞不起来。中国赫鲁晓夫鼓吹的这一套修正主义黑货，流毒很广，危害很大，一定要把它扫除干净。
    四清运动以前，我们红石门的干部，受了中国赫鲁晓夫修正主义路线的影响，搞过一阵物质刺激、工分挂帅，走了一段弯路。那时候，干部派活，先给定工分。年终分配，总想多见钱。一个几十户的小村，几年工夫，就亏空分配七千多元。
    一九六五年秋天，人民解放军带着红彤彤的革命宝书来了，带来了战无不胜的毛泽东思想。干部们学习了毛主席的教导：“富裕农民中的资本主义倾向是严重的。只要我们在合作化运动中，乃至以后一个很长的时期内，稍微放松了对于农民的政治工作，资本主义倾向就会泛滥起来。”大家对照毛主席的教导，回忆前几年所走过的道路，越忆越沉痛，越忆越悔恨，禁不住流下了眼泪。在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争中，干部们深深体会到：毛泽东思想是宝中宝，一时一刻离不了。紧跟毛主席，紧跟毛泽东思想就是胜利；离开毛主席，背离毛泽东思想，就会走到资本主义邪路上去。从此，干部们带头活学活用毛主席著作，带头突出政治，带头搞好思想革命化。
    闸沟垫地的第一个春节，社员们都放假休息了。可是，全大队的干部、党员和一部分青年积极分子，却没有休息，也没有挨门挨户去拜年，而是坐在一起，重温光辉的毛主席著作。大家说，过去，我们搞过物质刺激、工分挂帅，差一点滑到修正主义邪道。今天，我们要带头突出无产阶级政治，带头搞思想革命化，带头走毛主席指出的光明大道。于是，大家破除旧俗，拿起工具，到大沟筑坝，搞义务劳动。社员们看到干部们的革命行动很受感动，也跟着一起干。一天工夫，就修起一道三丈长，五尺宽的大坝。这不仅是在荒山沟里垒起的第一道防洪坝，更重要的是在人们思想上，筑起了一道“公”字的大坝。
    在无产阶级文化大革命运动中，我们红石门大队，毛泽东思想大普及，无产阶级“公”字大发扬，集体生产大发展，公共积累大增加。我们不仅弥补了过去的亏空，还积累公共资金一万多元。
    突出政治，是办好社会主义集体经济的根本方向。我们发展集体经济，不靠工分挂帅，不靠物质刺激，全靠毛泽东思想，全靠政治思想工作，全靠人的思想革命化。中国赫鲁晓夫是社会主义的绊脚石，我们要踢开这个绊脚石。我们永远突出无产阶级政治，在毛主席指引的社会主义大道上胜利前进。
