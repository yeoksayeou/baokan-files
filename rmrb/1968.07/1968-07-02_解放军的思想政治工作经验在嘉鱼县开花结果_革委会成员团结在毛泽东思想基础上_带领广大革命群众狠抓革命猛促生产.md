The PLA's political and ideological work experience has bloomed and borne fruit in Jiayu County, Hubei Province. The members of the Revolutionary Committee have united on the basis of Mao Zedong Thought, leading the broad revolutionary masses to focus on the revolution and vigorously promote production.

According to Xinhua News Agency, the military representatives in the Jiayu County Revolutionary Committee have brought the PLA's experience of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, emphasizing proletarian politics, adhering to the Four Firsts, and focusing on active thoughts into the committee. This has promoted unity among the committee members, enabling them to work together in leading the broad revolutionary masses to focus on the revolution and vigorously promote production, striving for a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The Jiayu County Revolutionary Committee was established in December last year. At that time, some members were still influenced by bourgeois factionalism and had not completely eliminated it. When there were disagreements among the members, especially among the standing committee members, they could not discuss them in time, which was not conducive to unity among them on the basis of Mao Zedong Thought. In this situation, the committee chairman Liu Hongming and five other military representatives seriously studied the great leader Chairman Mao's teachings: "Only through the unity of the Communist Party can the unity of the whole class and the whole nation be achieved, and only through the unity of the whole class and the whole nation can the enemy be defeated." They unanimously agreed that if the representatives of the revolutionary three-in-one combination temporary power organ do not act in unison, they cannot effectively lead the broad revolutionary masses to follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They declared: Military representatives have the important political responsibility to consolidate and develop the Revolutionary Committee. We must set an example, emphasize proletarian politics, adhere to the Four Firsts, focus on active thoughts, widely carry out heart-to-heart talks, and promote unity among the Revolutionary Committee members on the basis of Mao Zedong Thought.

Military representative and committee chairman Liu Hongming first organized the committee members to study Chairman Mao's teachings: "Problems should be put on the table. Not only the 'squad leader' should do this, but the committee members should also do this. Do not gossip behind the scenes. If there is a problem, hold a meeting, put it on the table for discussion, and define a few rules, and the problem will be solved." He guided everyone to put problems on the table and solve them. When some standing committee members had disagreements, the military representatives studied Chairman Mao's teachings on "there is no fundamental conflict of interest within the working class" with these standing committee members, and actively sought out the standing committee members who had misunderstandings for individual heart-to-heart talks, doing painstaking ideological and political work. On this basis, they held a standing committee heart-to-heart talk meeting, guiding everyone to be open and frank, laying all problems on the table. In this way, the more they talked, the clearer the problems became, and the more they talked, the more comfortable they felt. Through these talks, they eliminated misunderstandings, strengthened unity, and directed their efforts against the enemy, thoroughly smashing the evil plots of the class enemy to sabotage the Revolutionary Committee.

In the process of helping revolutionary mass representatives eliminate misunderstandings and strengthen unity, the military representatives always emphasized acting according to Chairman Mao's teachings of "each doing more self-criticism" and used their own experiences in fighting selfishness to inspire them. The exemplary actions of the military representatives led other standing committee members to actively express their thoughts, actively engage in self-criticism, actively take on responsibilities, and form a good atmosphere of mutual help, mutual understanding, and mutual support among them.

During the heart-to-heart talk activities, they used Mao Zedong Thought as the criterion to engage in active ideological struggle on principle issues, unifying understanding and strengthening unity. Once, during a standing committee meeting discussing how to focus on class struggle, there were differing opinions, and some revolutionary cadre representatives were afraid that others would say they were supporting one opinion and suppressing another, and thus did not dare to express their views. In response to this active thought, the military representatives studied Chairman Mao's teachings with the standing committee members during the heart-to-heart talk activities: "We advocate active ideological struggle because it is a weapon to achieve unity within the party and revolutionary organizations and make them more effective in battle. Every Communist Party member and revolutionary should take up this weapon." Everyone realized: On principle issues, one must be clear-cut and unambiguous, unifying understanding and action on the basis of Mao Zedong Thought. After raising their awareness, some revolutionary cadre representatives who previously dared not boldly express their opinions on principle issues now also dare to actively participate in ideological struggle, taking the defense of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and the unity of the Revolutionary Committee as their major political responsibility.

In the half-year since the establishment of the Jiayu County Revolutionary Committee, the military representatives have held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, emphasized proletarian politics, adhered to the Four Firsts, focused on active thoughts, and persistently carried out heart-to-heart talk activities. This has significantly enhanced the unity of the Revolutionary Committee, making it a strong command center for uniting the people of the entire county and defeating the enemy. Currently, the county Revolutionary Committee is leading the broad revolutionary masses, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, closely following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, pushing the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new high, carrying out a heated revolutionary criticism, and launching a fierce attack on a handful of class enemies, achieving one victory after another. The revolutionary people of the entire county are full of revolutionary spirit, with boundless enthusiasm, and the revolution and production are presenting a prosperous scene.

    解放军的思想政治工作经验在嘉鱼县开花结果
    革委会成员团结在毛泽东思想基础上
    带领广大革命群众狠抓革命猛促生产
    据新华社武汉电　湖北省嘉鱼县革命委员会中的军队代表，把人民解放军活学活用毛泽东思想，突出无产阶级政治，坚持四个第一，大抓活思想的经验带进革委会，促进了革委会成员之间的团结，使革委会成员拧成一股劲，团结一致地带领广大革命群众狠抓革命，猛促生产，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
    嘉鱼县革命委员会是去年十二月成立的。当时，个别成员受到资产阶级派性的影响还没有完全消除，委员之间，特别是常委之间有了意见还不能及时交谈，不利于相互间在毛泽东思想原则基础上的团结。在这种情况下，革委会主任刘洪鸣等五名军队代表，认真学习了伟大领袖毛主席的教导：“只有经过共产党的团结，才能达到全阶级和全民族的团结，只有经过全阶级全民族的团结，才能战胜敌人”。一致认为，如果参加革命三结合临时权力机构的代表动作不整齐，就不能很好地带领广大革命群众紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。他们表示：军队代表负有巩固和发展革委会的重大的政治责任，我们一定要以身作则，大力突出无产阶级政治，坚持四个第一，大抓活思想，广泛开展谈心活动，促进革委会成员之间在毛泽东思想原则基础上的团结。
    军队代表、革委会主任刘洪鸣首先组织革委会成员学习毛主席的教导：“要把问题摆到桌面上来。不仅‘班长’要这样做，委员也要这样做。不要在背后议论。有了问题就开会，摆到桌面上来讨论，规定它几条，问题就解决了。”引导大家把问题摆到桌面上来解决。有的常委相互间有意见，军队代表就和这些常委一起学习毛主席关于“在工人阶级内部，没有根本的利害冲突”的教导，主动地找有隔阂的常委双方个别谈心，做艰苦细致的思想政治工作。在这个基础上召开常委谈心会，引导大家开诚布公，把问题和盘托出。这样，大家越谈问题越清楚，越谈心情越舒畅。通过谈心，他们之间消除了隔阂，增强了团结，把矛头一致对准敌人，彻底粉碎了阶级敌人破坏革委会的罪恶阴谋。
    军队代表在帮助革命群众代表消除隔阂、增强团结的过程中，总是强调遵照毛主席“各自多做自我批评”的教导办事，并且用自己斗私的经验启发他们。军队代表的模范行动，带动了其他常委普遍能够主动亮思想，主动做自我批评，主动担担子，相互之间形成了互相帮助、互相谅解、互相支持的良好气氛。
    在谈心活动中，他们在原则问题上，以毛泽东思想为准则，开展积极的思想斗争，以统一认识，增强团结。有一次，常委会讨论如何抓阶级斗争时，有了分歧意见，个别革命干部代表怕别人说他支持一种意见压制另一种意见，因而不敢表示态度。针对这种活思想，军队代表在谈心活动中就和常委们一起学习毛主席的教导：“我们主张积极的思想斗争，因为它是达到党内和革命团体内的团结使之利于战斗的武器。每个共产党员和革命分子，应该拿起这个武器。”大家认识到：原则性的问题，一定要旗帜鲜明，态度明朗，在毛泽东思想的基础上统一认识，统一行动。认识提高之后，原来在原则问题上不敢大胆发表意见的个别革命干部代表，现在也敢于积极参加思想斗争，把维护毛主席的无产阶级革命路线和革委会的团结，当作自己重大的政治责任。
    嘉鱼县革委会成立半年来，军队代表高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，突出无产阶级政治，坚持四个第一，大抓活思想，坚持开展谈心活动，对增强革命委员会的团结，收到了显著的效果，使革命委员会成为团结全县人民，战胜敌人的坚强战斗指挥部。目前，县革命委员会领导广大革命群众，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，把活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动推向了高潮，革命大批判开展得热火朝天，稳、准、狠地向一小撮阶级敌人发动猛烈进攻，取得了一个又一个的胜利。全县革命人民革命精神焕发，干劲冲天，革命和生产呈现一片欣欣向荣的景象。
