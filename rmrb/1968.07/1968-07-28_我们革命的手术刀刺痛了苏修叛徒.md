In the great situation where the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has achieved decisive victories nationwide, we, the entire staff of the medical department, with boundless loyalty to our great leader Chairman Mao, have successfully removed a 90-kilogram retroperitoneal fibrosarcoma from Zhang Qiuxiu, a female commune member suffering from an "incurable disease." This is a rare success in medical history.

The success of this surgery is a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. From our practice, we deeply feel that without Mao Zedong Thought arming our minds and directing our battles, such a small medical unit would never have been able to complete such a complex surgery and achieve such a great victory. It is Mao Zedong Thought that has given us boundless wisdom and strength, given Zhang Qiuxiu a second life, and created this miracle.

The traitorous Soviet revisionists gnash their teeth in rage,
Revealing their trembling hearts.

When this deed was widely praised by the masses, the mouthpiece of the Soviet revisionist clique, "Tass," came out to viciously attack us for "relying on Mao Zedong Thought to perform abdominal surgery," and for attributing all our achievements to the "miraculous influence of Mao Zedong Thought." They attempted to use their filthy spit to defame our glorious achievements and the great Mao Zedong Thought. The traitorous Soviet revisionists' gnashing teeth and curses precisely prove that our achievements, like a sharp sword, have touched their nerves and pierced their hearts, proving how much this bunch of traitors fears the great power of Mao Zedong Thought.

Between us and the Soviet revisionist clique, there are two fundamentally opposed worldviews and two fundamentally different systems. We are selfless communist warriors armed with Mao Zedong Thought, while you are despicable, shameless revisionist traitors. We are advancing socialist revolution and construction, while you have thoroughly restored capitalism. What we consider natural, you consider heinous. Our achievements are your disasters. What we consider good, you consider bad. The contrast between these two standpoints, views, and methods is as clear as black and white, as incompatible as fire and water. If you did not howl in hysteria at our success in this surgery, wouldn't that be strange?

The Soviet revisionist clique boasted that our "relying on Mao Zedong Thought to perform abdominal surgery" is "the most laughable thing." In fact, this exposes your treacherous betrayal of Marxism-Leninism.

Marx long ago pointed out: "Theory, once grasped by the masses, also becomes a material force." Lenin also said: "Human consciousness not only reflects the objective world but also creates the objective world."

Our great leader Chairman Mao has brilliantly and creatively developed the dialectical materialism of Marxism-Leninism. Chairman Mao teaches us: matter can turn into spirit, and spirit can turn into matter. The transformation of matter into spirit is a leap, and the transformation of spirit into matter is another leap, "and this leap is more significant than the previous one."

Our medical department's successful removal of a giant tumor vividly proves: once Mao Zedong Thought is grasped by the masses, it becomes an endless force, a spiritually powerful atomic bomb; people armed with Mao Zedong Thought can overcome all difficulties and create miracles on earth.

Serving the People
Or Serving a Bunch of Privileged Classes?

The fundamental reason for our success in removing the tumor is that we followed Chairman Mao's teaching of "wholeheartedly serving the people." The Chinese People's Liberation Army is the people's army personally founded and led by our great leader Chairman Mao. We are the children of the people, closely connected with the poor and lower-middle peasants. Our medical department's door is small, but it is open to the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants. In just one year, our outpatient department and medical teams treated over 30,000 peasants. Zhang Qiuxiu is our class sister and a victim of the reactionary line pushed by the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in the medical field. Rescuing the life of such a class sister is our duty. It is precisely because of our loyalty to Chairman Mao, our class love for the poor and lower-middle peasants, and our hatred for the Chinese Khrushchev that we decided, despite the risks, to accept this patient who had been sentenced to "death" by certain "experts" and "authorities." We were not afraid of trouble and visited many medical units to gather information and learn from their experiences. We also conducted over 30 complex examinations on the patient to prepare for the surgery in every possible way. We were not afraid of dangers and used every means to remove the tumor from behind the peritoneum without opening the peritoneal cavity.

Throughout the treatment process, many touching stories of wholeheartedly serving the patient emerged. One of our medical staff worked day and night to care for the patient, to the point that after the patient recovered, he himself fell ill. Our broad masses of soldiers and cadres enthusiastically and actively donated more than half of their blood volume compared to Zhang Qiuxiu's. Without the spirit taught by Chairman Mao of "selflessness and dedication," how could we ensure the success of this surgery?

Such a spirit of sparing no effort to treat an "incurable disease" of a laborer who has lost her labor power, and thoroughly working for the people's interests, is of course unimaginable for the Soviet revisionists. The Soviet revisionists are a bunch of bourgeois elements who live by sucking the blood and sweat of the working people. Marx once sharply exposed their despicable psychology when he talked about the bourgeoisie's cold-blooded indifference to the health, life, and suffering of laborers: "Since this pain increases our pleasure (profit), why should we bother to care about it?" Aren't the Soviet revisionists exactly like this?

The Brezhnev-Kosygin clique is the political representative of the Soviet bourgeois privileged class. They only know how to plunder the labor fruits of the broad Soviet people and do not care about the interests of the laboring people at all. This can be seen very clearly in their medical and health work. According to the statistics published by the Soviet revisionist clique on the distribution of doctors in urban and rural areas in the Soviet Union, the number of doctors in cities increased from 89% of the total number of doctors in 1956 to 93% in 1966, while the number of doctors in rural areas decreased from 11% to 7% in the same period. This fully shows that the medical and health work line pushed by the Soviet revisionist clique is a thoroughly bourgeois reactionary line that serves a small number of people. In today's Soviet Union, whether in rural or urban areas, a small privileged class can enjoy various modern medical facilities, while the broad laboring people cannot get the necessary treatment when they are sick. The Soviet revisionist clique boasts about "everything for people, for people's happiness," but in reality, all their policies and lines are for the privileged class that oppresses and exploits the people.

Political Command
Or Ruble Command?

The success of this surgery is also because we firmly remember Chairman Mao's teaching that "politics is the commander, the soul," and highlight proletarian politics. In terms of technology, our medical department has no "authorities" or "experts," and our equipment is relatively primitive. If we had followed the so-called "graded medical care" rules pushed by the Chinese Khrushchev in the past, our conditions could only be used for appendicitis, hemorrhoids, and the like. For such a high-difficulty and high-risk tumor removal surgery, we would not be able to, and would not be allowed to, perform it. However, we rely not on technology, but on proletarian politics, on Mao Zedong Thought. From beginning to end, we use politics to command technology, to command everything.

We believe that treating Zhang Qiuxiu is not just an ordinary medical operation, but a battle to defend Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and oppose the Chinese Khrushchev's bourgeois reactionary line. In this battle, we, the people's warriors and ordinary medical staff, have nothing to lose in terms of fame and position. We only think about defending Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Our technical level may not be high, and our medical experience may not be sufficient, but we know that technology is created by people and is used by people. It is precisely because of this that we can be bold and dare to break many old and foreign frameworks, overturn the conclusion of "incurable disease" made by certain "experts" and "authorities," and dare to boldly treat this "strange disease" that we have never seen before. For the patient, we first focus on her thoughts. We broke the past conventions and gave Zhang Qiuxiu her first medical order, not to take any medicine, but to study Chairman Mao's works. It is precisely because we armed the patient's mind with Mao Zedong Thought that she was able to dispel her despair and gain the confidence to overcome the disease, which played an important role in the success of the surgery. Throughout the surgery process, from blood transfusion, anesthesia, incision to tumor removal, we encountered many unexpected problems and dangers. However, because we used Mao Zedong Thought to command every battle, we could remain confident, correctly recognize things, analyze problems, and quickly find solutions. In short, because we had a great passion to "dedicate our hearts to Chairman Mao," highlight proletarian politics, we achieved success in this surgery.

The Soviet revisionist clique is a bunch of "fetishists" who believe in technology. They think that without technology, nothing can be done. Therefore, in their eyes, such a small medical department like ours, which lacks "necessary technical conditions," daringly performs such a "highly complex abdominal surgery," is simply "audacious." These shameless people viciously attack us for emphasizing political command as "destroying objective laws," but in reality, we only destroy the "law of money supremacy" that they worship. The Soviet revisionist clique is now vigorously advocating "ruble command" in the Soviet Union, promoting bourgeois selfishness, and using fame and wealth to drive people to serve them. The heads of the Soviet health department openly advocate that "material incentives are a means to increase labor productivity." Isn't it precisely because of this revisionist line pushed by you traitors that various evil results of seeking only personal fame and wealth, regardless of the patient's life and death, have appeared in the Soviet medical and health work?

Rely on the Masses
Or Suppress the Masses' Enthusiasm?

The success of this surgery is also because we followed Chairman Mao's teaching that "the masses are the real heroes" and "the people have limitless creativity," firmly took the mass line, fully believed in the masses, mobilized the masses, and relied on the masses.

We not only mobilized the enthusiasm of all the staff in the medical department but also organized the entire barracks of soldiers, cadres, and family members to participate in this battle. Before the surgery, we discussed possible problems and difficulties that might arise during the surgery, and everyone suggested ideas and solutions. We collected scattered opinions and suggestions and finally summarized "ten what-ifs" and over 120 specific measures. A medical staff member worked for three days and nights to design an ideal incision diagram, which provided great help for the surgery. A military doctor who had only studied anesthesia for three months prepared a "homemade anesthesia pot," which played an unexpectedly great role when various modern anesthesia tools failed. In short, because everyone's heart and strength were united, we collectively brainstormed and found solutions to many unexpected things, did many things that we originally thought we could not do, and overcame many difficulties that we originally thought we could not overcome.

The Soviet revisionist traitors, like all representatives of the exploiting classes, regard the people as "ignorant mobs." How could they possibly mobilize the collective wisdom of the masses? Moreover, this bunch of traitors who have betrayed the people stand in a position opposite to the broad masses of the people and are terrified of the masses, so they can never believe in and rely on the masses. They can only rely on a group of bourgeois intellectuals they have raised to maintain their reactionary rule over the broad laboring people. For this reason, the Soviet revisionist clique has recently promoted "scholars" and "experts" in production and other departments, allowing them to monopolize science and technology and enjoy privileges. The Soviet revisionist clique has recently implemented a new "principle" in many medical units: "expand the power of medical institution leaders so that they can mobilize all human, material, and financial resources." This is actually to let a few reactionary authorities who occupy leading positions make decisions alone. In the medical and health field, it is like this, and in other departments, it is no different. Even Western bourgeois newspapers say that in today's Soviet Union, "experts" and "scholars" have formed a "highest stratum" and "control everything." Under these circumstances, the enthusiasm and creativity of the broad masses of the people are completely suppressed.

Mao Zedong Thought
Is the Source of Our Strength

In summary, throughout our surgery process, Mao Zedong Thought shone like a beacon, illuminating every step we took. Mao Zedong Thought is the source of our strength and the guarantee of our victory.

Lenin once pointed out: "The development of Marxism, the spread and consolidation of Marxist ideas among the working class, will inevitably make the bourgeoisie's attacks on Marxism more frequent and more violent."

Today, the world has entered a new era with Mao Zedong Thought as the great banner. The invincible Mao Zedong Thought is not only widely spread among the people of our country but also among the revolutionary people of the world. How can this not make the Soviet revisionist clique tremble with fear?

The Soviet revisionist clique is a bunch of vampires riding on the heads of the Soviet people and a bunch of great traitors who betray the interests of the people of the world. They are slaves who kneel at the feet of imperialism. They are most afraid that the spread of Mao Zedong Thought will make the broad masses of the people see through the reactionary face of this bunch of traitorous scoundrels more clearly, most afraid that the broad masses of the people will learn and apply Mao Zedong Thought to rise up and rebel against imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries, overthrow their cannibalistic "banquet," and destroy their "paradise" where they rule arbitrarily. However, all their howls are in vain. Mao Zedong Thought, combined with the revolutionary people of the world, will surely sweep away the old world.

Listen, you masters of the Soviet revisionist clique, your vicious attacks can never stop the victorious steps of the Chinese people armed with Mao Zedong Thought, but can only arouse our greater hatred and strengthen our resolve to carry the struggle against modern revisionism to the end.

Although we have only removed a tumor from a person's body in this surgery, we deeply feel that imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries in various countries are not also tumors in modern human society? No matter how frightening this big tumor looks, the people of the world are determined to remove it. We believe that the revolutionary people armed with Mao Zedong Thought can not only remove the big tumor from the patient's body but will surely use the revolutionary scalpel to completely, thoroughly, and cleanly remove the big tumor that harms the people of the world from the earth!

    我们革命的手术刀刺痛了苏修叛徒
    中国人民解放军驻保定某部卫生科
    春风杨柳万千条，六亿神州尽舜尧。在全国无产阶级文化大革命取得决定性胜利的大好形势下，我们卫生科的全体同志怀着对伟大领袖毛主席的无限忠诚，为患有“不治之症”的人民公社女社员张秋菊同志摘除了九十斤重的“腹膜后纤维肉瘤”，取得了医学史上罕见的一次手术成功。
    这次手术的成功，是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，是毛主席无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利。我们从实践中深深地体会到，如果不是用毛泽东思想来武装我们的头脑，指挥我们的战斗，我们这样一个小小的医疗单位决不可能完成这样复杂的手术，取得这样巨大的胜利。是毛泽东思想给了我们无穷的智慧和力量，是毛泽东思想给了张秋菊同志第二次生命，是毛泽东思想的威力创造了这个奇迹。
            苏修叛徒咬牙切齿
                暴露他们胆战心惊
    当这个事迹受到广大人民热烈赞扬的时候，苏修叛徒集团的喉舌“塔斯社”却出来疯狂攻击我们“靠毛泽东思想进行腹腔手术”，攻击我们把一切成就“都归功于毛泽东思想的神效影响”。他们妄想用自己的肮脏的唾沫，来诋毁我们的光辉成就，诋毁伟大的毛泽东思想。苏修叛徒咬牙切齿的咒骂，恰恰证明了我们的成就象利剑一样，触痛了他们的神经，刺进了他们的心脏，证明了他们这一小撮叛徒对于毛泽东思想的巨大威力是多么害怕。
    我们同苏修集团之间，存在着两种根本对立的世界观和两种根本不同的制度。我们是用毛泽东思想武装起来的大公无私的共产主义战士，你们是卑鄙无耻的修正主义叛徒；我们正在把社会主义革命和社会主义建设推向前进，你们却全面彻底地复辟了资本主义。我们认为理所当然的事情，在你们看来必然是大逆不道的。我们的成就，是你们的灾难。我们认为好得很的事，你们觉得糟得很。这两种立场、观点、方法的区别和对比，就象黑白一样的分明，水火一样的不相容。如果你们不是歇斯底里地对我们这次手术的成功发出一通嚎叫，那岂不是咄咄怪事了吗？
    苏修叛徒集团大放厥词，说什么我们“靠毛泽东思想进行腹腔手术”是“最可笑的一件事”。其实，这正是暴露你们对马克思列宁主义的无耻背叛。
    马克思早就指出：“理论一经掌握群众，也会变成物质力量”。列宁也说过：“人的意识不仅反映客观世界，并且创造客观世界。”
    我们伟大领袖毛主席天才地创造性地发展了马克思列宁主义的辩证唯物论。毛主席教导我们：物质可以变成精神，精神可以变成物质。物质变精神是一次飞跃，精神变物质又是一次飞跃，“这次飞跃，比起前一次飞跃来，意义更加伟大。”
    我们卫生科这一次成功地进行了摘除特大肿瘤的手术，最生动地证明了：毛泽东思想一旦为广大人民群众所掌握，就会变成无穷无尽的力量，变成威力无比的精神原子弹；用毛泽东思想武装起来的人，能克服一切困难，创造人间的奇迹。
      为人民服务
          还是为一小撮特权阶层服务
    我们在摘除肿瘤的手术中所以取得成功，最根本的一条就是我们遵循了毛主席关于“全心全意地为人民服务”的教导。我们中国人民解放军是伟大领袖毛主席亲自缔造和领导的人民军队，是中国人民的子弟兵，同贫下中农有着血肉的联系。我们卫生科的门虽小，但却是向广大贫下中农敞开的。仅仅在去年一年内，我们的门诊部和医疗队就为附近的农民诊治了三万多人次。张秋菊同志是我们的阶级姐妹，又是中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人在医疗事业中推行的资产阶级反动路线的受害者。抢救这样一位阶级姐妹的生命是我们义不容辞的责任。正是因为怀着对毛主席的赤胆忠心，对贫下中农的阶级友爱，对中国赫鲁晓夫的刻骨仇恨，我们才下定决心，不怕风险，接收了这个已被某些“专家”“权威”判了“死刑”的病人；我们才不怕麻烦，到许多医疗单位了解情况，学习经验，并且对病人进行了三十多项复杂的检查，为手术作好了各种各样的准备；我们才不怕艰险，千方百计在不打开腹膜腔的情况下摘除了腹膜后的肿瘤。
    在整个治疗过程中，出现了许多全心全意为病人服务的动人事迹。我们的一个卫生员夜以继日地护理病人，以致当病人脱险康复以后，他自己却累病了。我们的广大战士和干部，敲锣打鼓热情主动地献出了比张秋菊同志全身血液还多一半的血液。如果没有毛主席教导的这种“毫不利己专门利人”的精神，怎么能够保证这次手术的成功呢？
    这样千方百计地去医治一个丧失了劳动力的劳动者的“不治之症”、彻底地为人民利益工作的精神，对于苏修叛徒来说，当然是不可能设想的。苏修叛徒完全是一伙靠吮吸劳动人民血汗过活的资产阶级分子。马克思在谈到资产阶级对待劳动者的健康、寿命和痛苦的冷漠无情时，早就一针见血地揭露过他们的卑鄙心理：“这种痛苦既然能增加我们的快乐（利润），我们为什么要费神去管它？”苏修叛徒难道不正是这样的吗？
    勃列日涅夫—柯西金集团，是苏联资产阶级特权阶层利益的政治代表。他们只知道侵吞广大苏联人民的劳动果实，根本不把劳动人民的利益放在眼里。这从他们的医疗卫生工作中，也可以看得很明显。根据苏修集团自己公布的关于苏联医师在城乡分布的统计材料，苏联城市的医师数目从一九五六年占全国医师总数的百分之八十九，增加到一九六六年的百分之九十三；而在同一个期间，乡村的医师数目则从百分之十一减少到百分之七。这充分说明苏修集团所推行的医疗卫生工作路线，是彻头彻尾的为少数人服务的资产阶级反动路线。在今天的苏联，无论在农村和城市，一小撮特权阶层可享用各种现代化医疗设备，而广大劳动人民则有病得不到应有的治疗。苏修集团标榜什么“一切为了人，为了人的幸福”，实际上他们的一切政策和路线都是为了压迫和剥削人民的特权阶层的。
      政治挂帅
          还是卢布挂帅
    我们这次手术所以取得成功，还因为我们牢牢记住毛主席关于“政治是统帅，是灵魂”的教导，突出无产阶级政治。论技术，我们卫生科既无“权威”、“专家”，设备也比较简陋。如果按照中国赫鲁晓夫过去推行的苏修那一套所谓“阶梯医疗”的规章制度，我们的条件只能作阑尾炎、痔疮之类的手术，对于难度和险度这样高的肿瘤摘除手术，是根本不能，也不准许做的。但是，我们靠的并不是技术，而是无产阶级政治，是毛泽东思想。我们自始至终用政治统帅技术，统帅一切。
    我们认为，为张秋菊同志治病，并不是一个普通的医疗手术，而是捍卫毛主席无产阶级革命路线、反对中国赫鲁晓夫资产阶级反动路线的一场战斗。在这场战斗中，我们这些人民的战士，普通的医务人员，没有什么名利可丢，也没有什么地位可失，一心想的只是捍卫毛主席的革命路线。我们的技术水平虽然不高，我们的医疗经验虽然不足，但我们懂得，技术是人创造的，是由人去掌握使用的。正是因为这样，我们才能“敢”字当头，敢于打破许多老框框、洋框框，推翻了某些“专家”、“权威”所下的“不治之症”的结论，敢于大胆地治疗这个从未见过的“奇症”。对于病人来说，我们首先着重的也是她的思想。我们打破了过去的常规，给张秋菊开的第一个医嘱不是服用任何药物，而是学习毛主席著作。正是因为用毛泽东思想武装了病人的头脑，才能使她打消绝望情绪，获得了战胜疾病的信心，对手术的成功起了重要的作用。在整个手术进行的过程中，从输血、麻醉、切口到摘除肿瘤，我们都碰到了意想不到的难题和险情。但是，因为用毛泽东思想来指挥每一个战斗，我们能坚定信心，正确认识事物，分析问题，迅速找到解决办法。总之，因为我们怀着“一颗红心献给毛主席”的巨大热情，突出无产阶级政治，才取得了这次手术的成功。
    苏修集团是一些迷信技术的“拜物教徒”。他们认为，没有技术就什么事情也办不成。因此在他们看来，象我们这个“缺乏必要的技术条件”的小小的卫生科，居然冒昧进行这样一次“极其复杂的腹腔手术”，简直是“胆大妄为”。这些无耻之徒大肆攻击我们强调政治挂帅是什么“破坏客观规律”，实际上我们破坏的不过是他们奉若神明的“金钱万能”的“规律”罢了。苏修集团今天在苏联竭力鼓吹“卢布挂帅”，大搞“物质刺激”，发展资产阶级利己主义，用名、利来驱使人们为他们效劳。苏联的卫生部头头们就公开宣扬什么“物质刺激是提高劳动生产率的手段”。难道不正是因为你们这些叛徒推行的这一套修正主义路线，苏联医疗卫生工作中才出现了只图自己名利、不顾病人死活的种种恶果吗！
      依靠群众
        还是扼杀群众的积极性
    我们这次手术所以取得成功，还因为我们遵循毛主席关于“群众是真正的英雄”、“人民群众有无限的创造力”的教导，坚决走群众路线，充分相信群众，放手发动群众，紧紧依靠群众。
    我们不但调动了卫生科全体同志的积极性，而且还动员了整个营房的战士、干部和家属一道参加这场战斗。在进行手术之前，我们针对手术过程中可能出现的各种问题和困难，人人出主意，个个想办法，把分散的意见和建议集中起来，最后总结出“十个怎么办？”和一百二十多条具体措施。一位卫生员苦战三昼夜，设计出了一个比较理想的切口图，给手术提供了很大的帮助。一个只学习过三个月麻醉的军医准备的“土麻醉罐”，在各种现代麻醉工具不能奏效的时候，起了意想不到的巨大作用。总之，由于大家心往一处想，劲往一处使，群策群力，想方设法，许多本来想不到的事情想到了，许多本来做不了的事情做到了，许多本来难以克服的困难克服了。
    苏修叛徒同一切剥削阶级的代表人物一样，把人民群众看成是“无知的群氓”，他们怎么可能去发挥群众的集体智慧呢？！而且，这一伙背叛人民的家伙，站在同广大人民群众相对立的地位，对群众怕得要死，根本不可能相信和依靠群众。他们只能依靠自己所豢养的一批资产阶级知识分子来维持他们对广大劳动人民的反动统治。为此，苏修集团在生产和其他部门重用“学者”、“专家”，由他们垄断科学技术，享有特权。苏修集团近年来在许多医疗单位中实行了一个新的“原则”：“扩大医疗机构领导人的权力，使他能够调动一切人力、物力，财力”。这实际上就是完全由一些占据着领导地位的资产阶级反动权威说了算，让他们独断专行。在医疗卫生界是这样，在其他部门又何尝不是这样？连西方资产阶级报刊也说，在今天的苏联，“专家”、“学者”组成了一个“最高阶层”，他们
  “操纵着一切事业”。在这种情况下，广大人民群众的积极性和创造性完全被扼杀了。
      毛泽东思想
          是我们力量的源泉
    总而言之，在我们的整个手术过程中，毛泽东思想象一盏明灯那样照亮了我们的每一个步伐。毛泽东思想是我们力量的源泉，胜利的保证。
    列宁曾经指出：“马克思主义的发展、马克思主义思想在工人阶级中的传播和巩固，必然使资产阶级对马克思主义的这种攻击更加频繁，更加剧烈”。
    今天，世界已经进入以毛泽东思想为伟大旗帜的新时代。战无不胜的毛泽东思想不仅在我国人民当中，而且在全世界的广大革命人民当中广泛地传播。这怎么会不使苏修叛徒集团胆战心惊呢？
    苏修集团是骑在苏联人民头上的一小撮吸血鬼，是出卖世界人民利益的大叛徒，是跪倒在帝国主义脚下的奴仆。他们最害怕毛泽东思想的传播会使广大人民群众更加看清他们这一伙叛徒工贼的反动面目，最害怕广大人民群众学习和运用毛泽东思想，起来造帝国主义、修正主义和反动派的反，推翻他们吃人的“筵席”，摧毁他们作威作福的“天堂”。但是，他们的一切狂叫都是徒劳的。毛泽东思想同世界上亿万革命人民相结合，必将把整个旧世界打得落花流水。
    苏修叛徒集团的老爷们听着，你们的恶毒攻击，绝对阻挡不了用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民的胜利步伐，而只能激起我们更大的仇恨，只能加强我们把反对现代修正主义的斗争进行到底的决心。
    我们在这次手术中摘除的虽然只是人体内的肿瘤，但是我们深深地体会到，帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派，不也就是现代人类社会的大肿瘤吗？不管这个大肿瘤看上去多么吓人，全世界人民是下定决心要把它割除的。我们相信，用毛泽东思想武装起来的革命人民，不仅可以割除病人身上的大肿瘤，也一定可以用革命的手术刀，把帝、修、反这个危害世界人民的大肿瘤全部、干净、彻底地从地球上铲除掉！
