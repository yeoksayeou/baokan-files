In the process of seizing power for the proletarian revolutionary masses, I have gained a profound understanding: we must humbly and sincerely be the students of the masses.

Last March, when the revolutionary committee of the workshop was established, everyone elected me as the deputy director. As an ordinary worker, I suddenly found myself shouldering such a great responsibility, and my heart was unsettled. I felt that I lacked education and feared that I might cause the revolutionary committee to falter. Then I thought, this power was hard-won. Since the proletarian revolutionary masses of the workshop trust me, I will take on this responsibility.

When the seal of authority was placed in my hands, I dared not hold it too tightly. Those days, my mind was in turmoil, and even when eating and sleeping, I was pondering this matter. Later, I thought of Chairman Mao's teachings, "The masses are the real heroes," and I invited all the veteran workers of the entire section to a meeting to seek their help. At the meeting, the veteran workers, using the "exploitation is glorious" theory of the Chinese Khrushchev as a target, launched a reminiscence of bitterness and sweetness, denouncing the sufferings of the old society without power. The veteran workers all had personal experiences of the hardships of the old society. One veteran worker, who had previously worked as a laborer for the Japanese invaders at the Qiongling Iron Mine, lived in dilapidated barracks, with no protection from the cold in winter or the rain in summer. He ate acorn flour and wore sackcloth, working hard but unable to support his family, living in dire poverty, with two children starving to death. I too have suffered generation after generation. In the old society, I herded pigs for the landlord, carried heavy loads, and endured beatings and curses. Even in the coldest winter months, I went barefoot. It was only with great effort and tears that I endured until liberation. The more I reminisced with the veteran workers, the more I hated the old society. Finally, the veteran workers said: "In the old society, the capitalists and big landlords held the knife, killing and chopping at will. Why did we, the poor, toil like cattle generation after generation? It was because the seal of authority was not in our hands. Now we have taken back the seal of authority from the handful of capitalist roaders within the party, who had usurped it. This seal of authority is our lifeline! Old Hu, now that everyone trusts you, you are to hold power for everyone, so work hard!"

The veteran workers gave me a political lesson, making me realize that my previous thoughts were due to not understanding the weight of this "power."

Great Leader Chairman Mao said, "Revolutionary war is the people's business. Often it is not a matter of learning first and then doing, but of doing and then learning. Doing is learning." Learning from Chairman Mao's teachings, I recalled the time when I stood shoulder to shoulder with the proletarian revolutionary masses to launch a thorough criticism of the capitalist roaders. At that time, with a deep hatred for the Chinese Khrushchev, I resolutely used big-character posters to expose and strike the enemy. Lacking education and unable to write, I asked others to write for me. Once written, we went together to post them. At first, the capitalist roaders remained unperturbed, watching from the sidelines and laughing. The ghosts and snakes spread rumors: "You can write and post, but once this wind passes, the officials will still be officials." Everyone was furious and united more closely, holding criticism meetings, writing big-character posters, and using Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to deeply expose the enemy and strike them down. The class enemies were terrified and trembling in front of this iron wall, suffering head injuries and defeat, falling and stinking. I deeply felt that this victory was achieved by the broad revolutionary masses, armed with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, fighting bravely. Thinking carefully, in the past, we relied on the masses to seize power, and in the future, we will definitely rely on the masses to hold and use power well.

Not long after the revolutionary committee was established, due to the influence of anarchist tendencies in society, some people in our section were late and left early, working lazily. Seeing this situation, I was particularly anxious. I went to handle it myself, but it was always not resolved. Later, I went to the masses to find a solution. One team, after conducting a reminiscence of bitterness and sweetness education, saw a significant improvement in the workers' class consciousness and strengthened labor discipline. Therefore, I convened a meeting of the liaison personnel of various classes, first introducing the experience of this team, and then mobilizing everyone to come up with ideas. Everyone, based on their own experiences, unanimously agreed that conducting reminiscence of bitterness and sweetness and deeply carrying out revolutionary criticism could raise the class consciousness of the workers. Then, a reminiscence of bitterness and sweetness and revolutionary criticism meeting was held for the entire section, and this activity quickly spread to various classes. The entire section soon saw a new high tide of "grasp revolution, promote production."

For a period, the revolutionary criticism in the workshop did not deepen, and the enthusiasm was not as high as before. I thought, if the revolutionary criticism could not be carried out deeply, the consciousness of the two-line struggle would not be raised, the poison of the Chinese Khrushchev's revisionism would not be eliminated, and if things went wrong, the achievements of the past two years of the Cultural Revolution would not be consolidated. But how to make the revolutionary criticism deepen, I had no idea. I discussed this with the workers. Comrade Yang said, "To carry out the criticism deeply, we must find a way to combine it with the struggle-criticism-transformation of our section." Then everyone came up with many good ideas. I organized everyone according to these ideas, and with the help of the factory revolutionary committee, carried out thematic criticism by class. In the past, the capitalist roaders in the factory, to corrupt the workers, implemented more than twenty kinds of reward systems in our section alone, poisoning some people. The workers all remembered this account of the capitalist roaders, the more they criticized, the higher their spirits, further settling the accounts of the capitalist roaders who pushed the revisionist line of running the enterprise, making the criticism deepen continuously.

Over the past year, I have deeply felt that to hold power for the people, one must rely on the people to hold power. Relying on the invincible Mao Zedong Thought and mobilizing the revolutionary enthusiasm of the masses, I am not afraid of any difficulties. I am determined to hold and use power well for the proletariat!

### 为群众掌权　靠群众掌权

    为群众掌权　靠群众掌权
    沈阳冶炼厂动力科革命委员会副主任　胡金城
    在为无产阶级革命派掌权的过程中，我有一条最深刻的体会，就是恭恭敬敬地、老老实实地当群众的小学生。
    去年三月，车间革命委员会成立时，大家选我当副主任。象我这样一个普通的工人，一下子担了这么大责任，心里总是稳不住神。觉得自己没个文化，怕给革命委员会误了大事。又一想，这权来得不容易，既然车间无产阶级革命派信得过，我就承担下来。
    印把子放在手上，总不敢握得紧。那些天，脑子里老打架，吃饭睡觉也在盘算这件事。后来，我想到毛主席的教导，“群众是真正的英雄”，就把全科的老工人请来，开个座谈会，请他们帮助我。会上，老师傅们以中国赫鲁晓夫的“剥削有功”论为靶子，展开了忆苦思甜，控诉旧社会无权之苦。老师傅们对旧社会的苦难都有一段亲身感受。有一位老师傅，过去在弓长岭铁矿给日本侵略者当劳工，住在破烂不堪的工棚里，冬不挡寒，夏不遮雨，吃的是橡子面，穿的是麻袋片，拚死拚活地干还养活不了几口人，穷的叮当响，两个孩子活活地饿死了。我自己也是祖祖辈辈受苦。在旧社会，我给地主放猪，扛活，挨打受骂，十冬腊月还打着赤脚，好不容易一把汗一把泪地熬到了解放。我和老师傅们越忆越痛恨旧社会。最后，老师傅们说：“旧社会，资本家、大地主手里拿着刀，要杀就杀，要砍就砍，咱穷人世世代代做牛做马，啥原因？就是因为印把子不在咱们手里。现在我们又从党内一小撮走资派手中，把他们篡夺的印把子夺了回来，这印把子就是咱们的命根子啊！老胡，现在大家信得过你，要你为大家掌权，你就加劲干吧！”老师傅们给我上了一堂政治课，使我认识到自己原来的想法，就是不知道这个“权”字的分量。
    伟大领袖毛主席说：“革命战争是民众的事，常常不是先学好了再干，而是干起来再学习，干就是学习。”学习了毛主席的这一教导，使我想起和无产阶级革命派并肩大造走资派的反的时候。那时候，我怀着对中国赫鲁晓夫的刻骨仇恨，坚决地用大字报揭露和打击敌人。没文化，不会写，就请别人代笔，写好了，和大家一块去贴。开始，走资派若无其事，在一旁看笑话。牛鬼蛇神放风说：“你们写吧，贴吧，这股风一过，当官的还是官。”大家气愤极了，更紧密地团结在一起，开批判会，写大字报，以毛泽东思想为武器，深刻地揭露敌人，狠狠地打击敌人。阶级敌人在这个铜墙铁壁面前吓得胆战心惊，碰得头破血流，倒了，臭了。我深深感到，这个胜利，是靠战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装起来的广大革命群众英勇斗争取得的。仔细一想，过去靠群众夺了权，今后靠群众也一定会掌好权，用好权。
    革命委员会成立不久，由于社会上无政府主义思潮的影响，我们科里有的人迟到早退，劳动时松松垮垮。看到这种情况，我心里特别着急。自己跑去处理，可是总是解决不了，后来，我就到群众中找办法。有一个小组由于搞了忆苦思甜教育，工人的阶级觉悟有了很大提高，劳动纪律加强了。于是，我就召开了各班组的联络员会议，首先介绍了这个小组的经验，然后发动大家出主意。大家根据自己的切身体会，一致认为，进行忆苦思甜和深入开展革命大批判，能够提高工人群众的阶级觉悟。接着就召开了全科忆苦思甜和革命大批判大会，这个活动，迅速地在各班组展开了。全科很快出现了“抓革命，促生产”的新高潮。
    有一段时间，车间的革命大批判深入不下去，干劲没有以前那样高了。我想，革命大批判不能深入开展，两条路线斗争觉悟就提不高，中国赫鲁晓夫的修正主义流毒就不能肃清，弄不好两年来文化大革命的成果就不能巩固。但是怎样才能使革命大批判深入下去，我心里也没数。我便和工人们商量这个事。杨师傅说：“大批判要深入展开，就得想办法和本科的斗批改结合起来。”接着大家想出很多好办法。我按照这些办法把大家组织起来，在厂革命委员会的帮助下，以班组为单位展开了专题批判。过去厂内走资派为了腐蚀工人，单在我们科就实行了二十几种奖励制度，使一些人受了毒害。工人们脑子里都记着走资派这一笔账，越批劲头越高，进一步清算了本厂走资派所推行的修正主义办企业路线的流毒，使大批判不断深入。
    一年多来，我深刻地体会到，为群众掌权，必须靠群众掌权。靠战无不胜的毛泽东思想，靠发挥群众的革命积极性，什么困难我都不怕。为无产阶级掌好权用好权，我是铁心啦！
