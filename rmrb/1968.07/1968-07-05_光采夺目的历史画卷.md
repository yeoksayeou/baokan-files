		"Chairman Mao Goes to Anshan" is a magnificent poem that passionately praises our great leader Chairman Mao's revolutionary practice and revolutionary spirit. It is a precious work of art that passionately praises Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, carrying significant political meaning.

		From this painting, we see that as early as 1921, Chairman Mao traveled on foot to Anshan to be among the workers. He held an old umbrella in one hand, showing that Chairman Mao, undeterred by hardships and dangers, traveled through wind and rain to many places, visited countless laboring people, and sowed the seeds of revolution. Chairman Mao's clenched fist in the other hand shows his resolute will to lead the suffering Chinese people to rise up and seek liberation. The great leader's firm willpower inspires millions of workers and peasants who have suffered exploitation and oppression to resolutely and bravely fight against imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism.

		As soon as Chairman Mao arrived in Anshan, the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought shone throughout the entire mining area. The mountains and rivers of Anshan became more beautiful, the earth boiled with excitement, and the revolutionary situation immediately took on a new look. Look, the majestic peaks are bathed in the glow of the rising sun, and Chairman Mao is walking on the path of the rising sun, showing an unlimited bright revolutionary future. Look, the vast blue sky stretches endlessly, with clouds and winds surging, symbolizing this is an era of revolutionary storms and tempests. Millions of workers and peasants are armed with the great Mao Zedong Thought, and the revolutionary thunder rolls on, victory is just ahead!

		This oil painting powerfully demonstrates that it was our great leader Chairman Mao who opened up the revolutionary path in Anshan and led the workers' revolutionary movement. This is true history, a great achievement that will be forever recorded in the annals of revolution and forever etched in the hearts of revolutionary people. We workers, peasants, and soldiers want to see such history, want to see artworks that reflect Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. "Chairman Mao Goes to Anshan" meets our demands and expresses what we have long wanted to say. This painting strikes a powerful blow against those who steal credit from heaven and distort history, such as the Chinese Khrushchev, stripping away his disguise as an "old revolutionary" and "leader of the workers' movement." In fact, the Chinese Khrushchev is in cahoots with the bourgeoisie, a great traitor and great scoundrel. He surrendered to the capitalists in Anshan, promoting the opportunistic line of "labor-capital cooperation," leading the political struggle of the working class to a mere economic struggle, causing great losses to the revolution. Only our great leader Chairman Mao is the savior of the Chinese people, who can lead us to the path of complete liberation. This painting vividly presents a great truth: without Chairman Mao, there would be no liberation of the Chinese people, no victory for the Chinese revolution.

		In the past, under the rule of the counter-revolutionary literary black line, a small clique of capitalist roaders within the party occupied important cultural positions. They did not allow us workers, peasants, and soldiers to sing the praises of Chairman Mao and his proletarian revolutionary line. They used their authority to operate machines, extensively promoting the Chinese Khrushchev and the reactionary line he represented, creating counter-revolutionary public opinion for the restoration of capitalism. It was only under Chairman Mao's leadership in the unprecedented Cultural Revolution and with the personal care of Comrade Jiang Qing that revolutionary literary workers could create such beloved works by workers, peasants, and soldiers, passionately praising Chairman Mao's great image and revolutionary thoughts. Therefore, this painting is a product of the struggle between the two lines, a fruit of the victory of the proletarian literary line.

		"Chairman Mao Goes to Anshan" is also artistically excellent. Oil painting is an art form introduced from abroad. In the past, under the rule of the literary black line, oil paintings rarely reflected the struggles of workers, peasants, and soldiers, and rarely reflected Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. A small clique of counter-revolutionary revisionists in the literary world even slandered workers, peasants, and soldiers as not understanding oil paintings. In fact, we broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers really do not like to see their oil paintings. They smear a patch of color here and a patch of color there on the canvas, looking chaotic up close and blurry from a distance. This painting, "Chairman Mao Goes to Anshan," has a clear theme, concise composition, prominent figures, and vivid colors. There are no complex backgrounds on the canvas, and one can immediately see the great leader Chairman Mao. The authors deeply understand the wishes of us workers, peasants, and soldiers, fully expressing Chairman Mao's spirit, powerfully proving that oil painting can be used to serve workers, peasants, and soldiers and be loved by them. This once again embodies the absolute correctness of Chairman Mao's brilliant directive to make the past serve the present and foreign things serve China. This is a great victory for Chairman Mao's literary thought.

		The authors, Comrades Liu Chunhua and others, are Red Guards revolutionary youths. Their spirit of loving Chairman Mao, wholeheartedly serving proletarian politics, serving workers, peasants, and soldiers, daring to create, and daring to revolution is praiseworthy. Comrade Jiang Qing has instructed us to build a proletarian revolutionary literary team. Today, we have seen that in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, red literary warriors who have emerged are gradually growing. We enthusiastically welcome the appearance of this new flower of proletarian revolutionary literature, "Chairman Mao Goes to Anshan," and applaud it.

    光采夺目的历史画卷
    解放军某部电影放映员　乔世民　杨全生
    《毛主席去安源》，是热情歌颂我们伟大领袖毛主席革命实践和革命气魄的无比雄壮的诗篇，是一幅热情歌颂毛主席革命路线和战无不胜的毛泽东思想的具有重大政治意义的艺术珍品。
    从这幅画里，我们看到了早在一九二一年，毛主席长途跋涉步行到安源工人当中去的情景。他一手拿着一把旧的雨伞，这说明毛主席在风里雨里，不怕艰苦，不避危险地走遍了许多地方，访问过无数的劳动人民，播下了革命的种子。毛主席一手紧握着拳头，表明了毛主席领导受苦受难的中国人民，翻身求解放的坚强意志。伟大领袖的坚强意志，鼓舞着千百万遭受剥削和压迫的工农大众，决心去和帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义进行不屈不挠的英勇斗争。
    毛主席一到安源，毛泽东思想的光辉便照遍了整个矿区。安源的山川增色，大地沸腾，革命形势立即出现了一个崭新的局面。你看，那壮丽的山巅上映照着朝霞的光辉，毛主席正走在朝阳初升的道路上，显示着无限光明的革命前途。你看，那高高的碧空辽阔万里，风云激荡，象征着这是一个急风暴雨的革命时代，千百万工农大众被伟大的毛泽东思想武装起来了，革命的风雷滚滚，胜利就在前面！
    这幅油画有力地表明，是我们伟大领袖毛主席在安源开辟了革命的道路，领导了工人革命运动。这是真正的历史，是永载革命史册和永远记在革命人民心头的丰功伟绩。我们工农兵就是要看这样的历史，就是要看反映毛主席革命路线的美术作品。《毛主席去安源》这幅油画满足了我们的要求，说出了我们心里很久想说的话。这幅油画给了贪天之功、篡改历史的中国赫鲁晓夫以猛烈的一击，剥去了他伪装“老革命”、“工人运动领袖”的画皮。其实中国赫鲁晓夫是跟资产阶级穿一条裤子的，他是个大叛徒、大工贼。他在安源投降资本家，推行“劳资合作”的机会主义路线，把工人阶级的政治斗争引向单纯的经济斗争，给革命带来了重大的损失。只有伟大的领袖毛主席才是中国人民的大救星，才能引导我们走彻底解放的道路。这幅油画极其有力地表现了一个伟大的真理：没有毛主席就没有中国人民的解放，就没有中国革命的胜利。
    过去，在反革命文艺黑线的统治下，一小撮党内走资派窃踞了重要的文化阵地，他们不许我们工农兵歌颂毛主席，歌颂毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。他们利用职权，开动机器，大肆吹捧中国赫鲁晓夫和他代表的资产阶级反动路线，为复辟资本主义大造反革命舆论。革命文艺工作者只有在毛主席领导的史无前例的文化大革命运动中，在江青同志的亲切关怀下，才能创作出这样为工农兵所喜爱的，热情歌颂毛主席伟大形象和伟大革命思想的好画，因此这幅油画是两条路线斗争的产物，是无产阶级革命文艺路线胜利的成果。
    《毛主席去安源》在艺术上也是过硬的。油画本来是一种外国传来的艺术形式，过去在文艺黑线的统治下，油画很少反映工农兵的斗争，很少反映毛主席的革命路线。文艺界一小撮反革命修正主义分子还诬蔑工农兵不懂油画，其实对于他们画的油画，我们广大工农兵确实不爱看，他们在画布上东抹一块颜色，西抹一块颜色，近处看太杂乱，远处看模模糊糊一大片。这一幅《毛主席去安源》，主题很明确，构图很简练，人物很突出，色彩很鲜明，画面上没有复杂的背景，一眼就看到了画面中的伟大领袖毛主席。作者深知我们工农兵的心愿，把毛主席的神采表现得很充分，有力地证明了油画是可以用来为工农兵服务，并为工农兵所喜爱的。这又一次体现了毛主席古为今用，洋为中用的英明指示的无比正确，这是毛主席文艺思想的伟大胜利。
    作者刘春华等同志，是红卫兵革命小将，他们这种热爱毛主席，一心为无产阶级政治服务，为工农兵服务，敢于创造，敢于革命的精神是值得称赞的。江青同志指示我们要建立一支无产阶级的革命文艺队伍。今天我们已经看到了，在无产阶级文化大革命运动中涌现出来的红色文艺战士正在逐渐成长。我们热烈地为《毛主席去安源》这朵无产阶级革命文艺的新花的出现而欢欣鼓舞，拍手叫好。
