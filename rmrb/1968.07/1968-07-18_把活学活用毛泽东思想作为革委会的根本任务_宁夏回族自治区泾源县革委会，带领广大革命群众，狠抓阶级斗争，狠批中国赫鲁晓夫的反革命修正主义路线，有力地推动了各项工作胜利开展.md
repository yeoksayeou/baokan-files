The revolutionary committee of Jingyuan County in the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region has led the broad revolutionary masses to focus on class struggle and fiercely criticize the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of the Chinese Khrushchev, effectively promoting the successful development of all work.

A Xinhua News Agency report from Yinchuan dated July 17 states: The revolutionary committee of Jingyuan County, located at the foot of the Liupanshan Mountains in the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, has led the broad revolutionary masses to study and apply Mao Zedong Thought, focus on class struggle, and carry forward the Party's fine tradition of close ties with the masses. This has enabled the revolutionary committee to be consolidated and developed in the midst of the stormy class struggle, playing the role of a revolutionary command center of the proletariat, and receiving the enthusiastic support and endorsement of the broad revolutionary people of the Hui nationality.

	Promote proletarian politics, make studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought the fundamental task

After its establishment, the revolutionary committee of Jingyuan County has always made studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, implementing Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and carrying out the instructions of the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, its fundamental task. The day after the county revolutionary committee was established, it held a Mao Zedong Thought study class for members of the revolutionary committee and leaders of revolutionary mass organizations to study Chairman Mao's latest instructions and discuss how to further promote the mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought throughout the county. Upon completion of the study, the standing committee of the county revolutionary committee led the leaders of revolutionary mass organizations and office workers to go deep into all the people's communes in the county, holding various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes with the broad poor and lower-middle peasants to study and implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, consolidating and developing the revolutionary great alliance and the revolutionary three-in-one combination. As a result, within a relatively short period, revolutionary committees were established in all people's communes in the county.

	Under the leadership of the county revolutionary committee, from offices to rural areas, from communes, production brigades to the homes of commune members, Mao Zedong Thought study classes were universally established. Even Hui women who rarely participated in political activities and Hui elders who had been herding in the deep mountains for years participated in the study. The revolutionary people of the entire county read Chairman Mao's books every day, fiercely criticize the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of the Chinese Khrushchev, consciously engage in self-criticism and criticism of revisionism, and their class consciousness and awareness of the two-line struggle have been greatly enhanced, effectively promoting the successful development of all work.

The revolutionary committee of Jingyuan County regards the most rapid and widespread promotion and serious implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions as the most important matter. As soon as they hear Chairman Mao's latest instructions, members of the county and commune revolutionary committees rush to the communes and brigades, crossing mountains and valleys, to propagate Chairman Mao's latest instructions to the broad revolutionary masses and to study and implement them together with the revolutionary masses. In this way, even the Hui revolutionary masses in many remote mountainous areas can follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and advance victoriously along the proletarian revolutionary line of Chairman Mao.

	Firmly grasp the direction of the revolutionary struggle, and fiercely strike at a handful of class enemies

After its establishment, the revolutionary committee of Jingyuan County has always remembered Chairman Mao's great teaching of "never forget class struggle," focusing on the struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines, leading the broad revolutionary people to firmly oppose right-opportunism, right-splittism, and right-capitulationism, and to strike down the rightist reversal wind, launching a fierce offensive against the class enemies.

Under the leadership of the revolutionary committee, the revolutionary masses throughout the county have launched a high tide of revolutionary criticism. Many communes and brigades have held Mao Zedong Thought study classes with the main content of carrying out struggles against the enemy. The study classes use the method of bringing up a problem, studying a few quotations from Chairman Mao, criticizing a fallacy of the Chinese Khrushchev, and eliminating a stream of revisionist poison, achieving immediate results, and rapidly raising the class consciousness and two-line struggle consciousness of the broad revolutionary masses.

The revolutionary committee also sent Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams to areas where class struggle is complex to propagate the Party's policies, help the masses investigate the activities of class enemies, and accurately and fiercely strike at a handful of class enemies. Because the revolutionary committee of Jingyuan County armed the masses with Mao Zedong Thought, focused on revolutionary criticism, and focused on struggles against the enemy, long-unsolved counter-revolutionary cases were quickly solved, and deeply hidden traitors, spies, and counter-revolutionaries were one by one unearthed.

	Carry forward the style of close ties with the masses, and consciously accept the supervision of the masses

In practice, the revolutionary committee of Jingyuan County deeply felt that only by maintaining and carrying forward the Party's style of close ties with the masses can Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line be truly implemented, and the revolutionary committee can establish proletarian revolutionary authority.

The revolutionary committee has followed Chairman Mao's instruction to "organize a revolutionary leadership cadre that is closely linked to the masses," constantly criticizing the corrupt bourgeois style of old organizations that are detached from the masses, establishing a proletarian style of close ties with the masses, breaking down redundant administrative organizations, and implementing streamlining. Except for one standing committee member on duty, other standing committee members go deep into the grassroots and among the masses. Among the masses, they do not put on airs or engage in special treatment. They also fully play the role of revolutionary mass organizations such as the workers' congress, peasants' congress, and red guards' congress. Every major decision and combat deployment of the revolutionary committee is discussed and deliberated with the leaders of revolutionary mass organizations. The revolutionary committee often holds symposiums to analyze with the masses the new trends, characteristics, and problems of class struggle in the county, and to "often make a true report of the difficulties that have arisen to them, and study with them how to solve the difficulties," sincerely believing in the masses, relying on the masses, respecting the pioneering spirit of the masses, and implementing Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

"Without extensive people's democracy, proletarian dictatorship cannot be consolidated, and the power will be unstable." The revolutionary committee of Jingyuan County, following Chairman Mao's instructions, pays special attention to carrying forward the democratic style and consciously accepting the criticism and supervision of the masses. The revolutionary committee often listens to the opinions of revolutionary masses in the offices, encouraging everyone to make suggestions and criticisms about the work of the revolutionary committee. The leading members of the revolutionary committee often study with the revolutionary masses, take the lead in exposing their own shortcomings, exchange ideas, and consciously place themselves under the supervision of the masses. When going deep into the grassroots, members of the revolutionary committee pay more attention to seeking the opinions of revolutionary masses at any time. The revolutionary committee also actively invites leaders of revolutionary mass organizations such as the workers' congress, peasants' congress, and red guards' congress to hold symposiums, using Chairman Mao's latest instructions and the experiences of advanced units nationwide and in the region to check the work of the county, and propose measures to improve the work. They humbly accept and resolutely correct the correct opinions of the revolutionary masses; for the incorrect opinions of the revolutionary masses, they use the method of heart-to-heart talks to provide necessary explanations and education. The members of the revolutionary committee of Jingyuan County deeply feel that only by correctly handling the criticism of the masses can the revolutionary enthusiasm of the masses be protected. Now, more and more revolutionary masses are giving advice and suggestions to the county revolutionary committee, and the work of the revolutionary committee is more vigorous.

    把活学活用毛泽东思想作为革委会的根本任务
    宁夏回族自治区泾源县革委会，带领广大革命群众，狠抓阶级斗争，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义路线，有力地推动了各项工作胜利开展
    新华社银川十七日电　宁夏回族自治区六盘山下的泾源县革命委员会，带领广大革命群众活学活用毛泽东思想，狠抓阶级斗争，发扬党的密切联系群众的优良作风，使革委会在阶级斗争的大风大浪中不断得到巩固和发展，发挥了无产阶级革命战斗指挥部的作用，受到广大回族革命人民的热情支持和拥护。
    突出无产阶级政治，把活学活用
    毛泽东思想作为革委会的根本任务
    泾源县革命委员会成立以后，始终把活学活用毛泽东思想，执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，贯彻以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的指示，作为自己的根本任务。县革委会成立的第二天，就举办了有革委会成员和革命群众组织负责人参加的毛泽东思想学习班，学习毛主席的一系列最新指示，研究如何在全县范围内更加广泛深入地开展活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动。学习一结束，县革委会常委便带领革命群众组织负责人和机关工作人员，深入全县各个人民公社，和广大贫下中农一起大办各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，学习和落实毛主席的一系列最新指示，巩固和发展革命大联合和革命三结合。结果，在比较短的时间内，全县所有人民公社全部建立了革命委员会。
    在县革命委员会的领导下，全县从机关到农村，从公社、生产队到社员家里，普遍办起了毛泽东思想学习班，连过去很少参加政治活动的回族妇女和长年在深山放牧的回族老人，也参加了学习。全县革命人民天天读毛主席的书，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义路线，自觉地斗私批修，阶级觉悟和两条路线斗争觉悟大大提高，有力地推动了各项工作的胜利开展。
    泾源县革命委员会把最迅速、最广泛地宣传和认真地贯彻毛主席的最新指示，作为自己头等重要的大事。只要一听到毛主席的最新指示，县和公社革委会成员就闻风而动，翻山越岭，深入社队，向广大革命群众宣传毛主席的最新指示，并和革命群众一起学习，一起落实。这样，就使许多偏僻山区的回族革命群众，也能紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，沿着毛主席的无产阶级革命路线胜利前进。
    牢牢掌握革命斗争大方向，
      狠狠打击一小撮阶级敌人
    泾源县革委会成立后，牢记毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的伟大教导，狠抓两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争，带领广大革命人民坚定地反对右倾机会主义、右倾分裂主义、右倾投降主义，痛击右倾翻案妖风，主动地向阶级敌人发起了猛烈进攻。
    在革委会的领导下，全县革命群众掀起了革命大批判的高潮。不少社队举办了以开展对敌斗争为主要内容的毛泽东思想学习班。学习班采用带着一个问题，学习几段毛主席语录，批判中国赫鲁晓夫的一个谬论，肃清一股修正主义流毒的方法，收到了立竿见影的效果，迅速提高了广大革命群众的阶级觉悟和两条路线斗争觉悟。
    县革委会还派出毛泽东思想宣传队，到阶级斗争复杂的地区宣传党的政策，帮助群众调查阶级敌人的动向，稳、准、狠地打击一小撮阶级敌人。由于泾源县革委会用毛泽东思想武装群众，狠抓革命大批判，狠抓对敌斗争，多年未破的反革命案件被迅速破获，埋藏很深的叛徒、特务和反革命分子一个个地被挖了出来。
    发扬紧密联系群众的作风，
        自觉接受群众的监督
    泾源县革命委员会在实践中深深体会到，只有保持和发扬党的紧密联系群众的作风，才能真正贯彻毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，使革委会树立起无产阶级的革命权威。
    县革委会遵照毛主席“组织起一个革命化的联系群众的领导班子”的教导，不断批判旧机构那一套脱离群众的腐朽的资产阶级作风，树立无产阶级的紧密联系群众的革命作风，打破重叠的行政机构，实行了精兵简政。县革委会除留一个常委轮流值班外，其他常委分别深入基层，深入群众。在群众中，他们不摆架子，不搞特殊化。他们还充分发挥工代会、农代会和红代会等革命群众组织的作用。革委会的每一项重大决议和战斗部署，都和革命群众组织负责人一起酝酿讨论。革委会经常召开座谈会，和群众一起分析本县阶级斗争的新动向、新特点、新问题，并且“经常把发生的困难向他们作真实的说明，和他们一起研究如何解决困难的办法”，真心实意地相信群众，依靠群众，尊重群众的首创精神，贯彻执行毛主席的革命路线。
      “没有广泛的人民民主，无产阶级专政不能巩固，政权会不稳。”泾源县革委会遵照毛主席的教导，特别注意发扬民主作风，自觉接受群众的批评和监督。革委会经常听取机关革命群众的意见，鼓励大家对革委会的工作提出建议和批评。革委会领导成员经常和革命群众一起学习，带头亮私斗私，交流思想，主动地把自己置于群众的监督之下。在深入基层时，革委会成员更注意随时征求革命群众的意见。革委会还主动邀请工代会、农代会、红代会等革命群众组织的负责人进行座谈，请他们用毛主席的一系列最新指示和全国、全区先进单位的经验，来检查本县的工作，提出改进工作的措施。他们对于革命群众的正确意见，虚心接受，坚决改正；对于革命群众一些不正确的意见，则采取谈心的办法，加以必要的解释和教育。泾源县革委会成员深深体会到，只有这样正确地对待群众的批评，才能保护群众的革命积极性。现在，革命群众给县革委会出主意、提建议的人越来越多，革委会的工作更加朝气蓬勃。
