Thousands of students in Mexico City staged another demonstration on the evening of the 29th, protesting U.S. imperialism and the recent brutal suppression of students by the police. The police once again intervened savagely in the students' demonstration, and the students bravely fought back, engaging in a prolonged and fierce struggle with the police.

The demonstrating students chanted anti-U.S. slogans as they marched through the bustling streets of Mexico City, heading towards the U.S. Embassy.

When they reached the entrance of the "Zócalo" near the presidential palace, the police launched a savage attack on the students with batons and tear gas. The students bravely retaliated, using handguns and explosives in a fierce battle with the police. Some students climbed onto rooftops and attacked the police with stones and Molotov cocktails. The students also set fire to cars to create barricades, blocking about ten street segments west of the presidential palace. The battle continued from the evening of the 29th until dawn.

On the morning of the 30th, Mexican military police fired rockets at the gate of a middle school near the "Zócalo," then charged into the school with batons, attacking the barricades the students had set up.

Throughout the struggle, four students were martyred, dozens were injured, and many were arrested.

The savage suppression of students by Mexican military police not only exposed their brutality but also showed their panic and fear in the face of the students' brave struggle.

    新华社三十日讯　墨西哥城消息：墨西哥首都墨西哥城数千名学生二十九日晚再次举行示威游行，反对美国殖民主义，抗议警察当局最近对学生的血腥镇压。警察当局对学生这次示威游行又进行野蛮干涉，示威学生英勇回击，同警察进行了长时间的激烈的搏斗。
    示威学生高呼反美口号，通过墨西哥城的闹市区，并且准备向美国大使馆进发。
    当他们走到总统府附近的“中央广场”的入口处时，警察用棍棒和催泪弹向学生进行野蛮袭击，示威学生用手枪和炸药英勇回击，同警察展开激烈的搏斗。有的学生爬到屋顶上，用石块和汽油瓶袭击警察。学生们还用点燃的汽车作街垒，封锁了总统府以西约十个地段的街道。战斗由二十九日晚一直继续到天亮。
    三十日清晨，墨西哥军警竟然用火箭炮轰击位于“中央广场”附近的一所中学的校门，然后挥动警棍冲进学校，并且冲击学生们筑起的街垒。
    在整个斗争过程中，有四名学生壮烈牺牲，几十名学生受伤，许多人被捕。
    墨西哥军警对学生的野蛮镇压不仅暴露了他们的凶残，也表明了他们面临学生的英勇斗争而无比惊慌和恐惧。
