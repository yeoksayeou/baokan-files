In the triumphant songs of victory for the complete triumph of the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat, our important industrial base, Stygian, held a city-wide revolutionary workers' congress from June 29 to July 11. A unified, cohesive, and combative organization of the city's working class was established. This congress was a meeting where the workers of Stygian closely followed the great strategic deployment of Chairman Mao, further implementing revolutionary unity by system and industry; it was a congress where the workers of the entire city resolutely carried out the great leader Chairman Mao's personally approved "Anshan Constitution," thoroughly criticizing and repudiating the counter-revolutionary revisionist industrial line of the Chinese Khrushchev and a handful of capitalist roaders within the party; it was a congress where the workers of the entire city grasped revolution, promoted production, and vowed to achieve a complete victory in the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The people's democratic dictatorship needs the leadership of the working class. Because only the working class has the farthest vision, is the most selfless, and is the most thorough in its revolutionary spirit." Just like the working class across the nation, the working class of Stygian, who has made tremendous contributions in the socialist revolution and socialist construction, has fully played the role of the main force in the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat. Together with the Red Guards and the revolutionary masses, they have raised high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, carried forward the revolutionary spirit of the proletariat that "it is reasonable to rebel against the reactionaries," and engaged in a heroic struggle against the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Northeast China, Liaoning, and Stygian. They have won decisive victories in the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat in Liaoning Province and Stygian City, and established the revolutionary committees of Liaoning Province and Stygian City.

The great leader Chairman Mao recently pointed out profoundly: "The Cultural Revolution of the proletariat is, in essence, a political revolution of the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes under the conditions of socialism. It is a continuation of the long-term struggle between the Chinese Communist Party and the reactionary Kuomintang led by the broad revolutionary masses, and a continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie." Currently, the situation of the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat in Liaoning and Stygian is excellent and getting better. However, the closer the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat gets to complete victory, the more profound and complex the class struggle becomes. A handful of class enemies still attempt to make a desperate struggle. The Stygian City Revolutionary Workers' Congress is determined, under the leadership of the provincial and municipal revolutionary committees, to lead the working class of the entire city to advance along Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, to deeply and persistently carry out the great revolutionary criticism, to do a good job in cleaning up the class ranks, to launch more fierce attacks on the class enemies; to do a good job in the struggle, criticism, and reform within their own units; to further seriously implement Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production," to quickly launch a new high tide of grasping revolution and promoting production, to strive to complete and overfulfill the national production plan; to cherish and support the revolutionary committees, to support and endorse the People's Liberation Army, to further consolidate and develop the revolutionary great unity and revolutionary tripartite combination by system, by industry, and by class, based on the principles of Mao Zedong Thought, to strengthen the firm unity of the working class, to strengthen the firm unity between the military and the people, and to achieve new victories in the complete triumph of the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat.

"Navigating the vast sea relies on the helmsman, carrying out the revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought." To complete the great historical mission of the working class in the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat, the Stygian City Workers' Congress decided to carry out the mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought more extensively and deeply among all workers in the city, to vigorously establish various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, to deeply carry out the "three loyalties" activities of being infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, infinitely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and to continuously raise the class struggle and two-line struggle consciousness of the working class.

During the congress, leaders from the Liaoning Province and Stygian City Revolutionary Committees, the People's Liberation Army Stygian Forces, and the Liaoning Military Region attended the meeting and spoke.

The congress, amidst extremely enthusiastic applause and cheers, passed a telegram of respect to the great leader Chairman Mao.

    沈阳召开全市革命工人代表大会大会
    决心带领全市工人阶级，沿着毛主席的革命路线乘胜前进，深入持久开展革命大批判，向阶级敌人发动更猛烈进攻，搞好本单位斗、批、改，掀起抓革命促生产新高潮，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利
    新华社沈阳十六日电　在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的凯歌声中，我国重要工业基地沈阳在六月二十九日到七月十一日召开了全市革命工人代表大会，成立了全市工人阶级统一的、团结的、战斗的组织。这次大会，是沈阳市工人阶级紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，进一步按系统、按行业实现革命大联合的大会；是全市工人阶级坚决贯彻执行伟大领袖毛主席亲自批准的“鞍钢宪法”，大破中国赫鲁晓夫等党内一小撮走资派反革命修正主义工业路线的大会；是全市工人阶级抓革命、促生产，夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的誓师大会。
    毛主席教导我们：“人民民主专政需要工人阶级的领导。因为只有工人阶级最有远见，大公无私，最富于革命的彻底性。”同全国工人阶级一样，在社会主义革命和社会主义建设中做出了巨大贡献的沈阳市工人阶级，在无产阶级文化大革命中充分发挥了主力军的作用。他们同红卫兵小将和广大革命群众一起，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，发扬无产阶级“对反动派造反有理”的革命精神，同中国赫鲁晓夫及其在东北、辽宁和沈阳的代理人进行了英勇的搏斗，夺得了辽宁省和沈阳市无产阶级文化大革命的决定性胜利，建立了辽宁省和沈阳市革命委员会。
    伟大领袖毛主席最近深刻地指出：“无产阶级文化大革命，实质上是在社会主义条件下，无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命，是中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续，是无产阶级和资产阶级阶级斗争的继续。”当前，辽宁和沈阳地区的无产阶级文化大革命形势大好，越来越好。但是，无产阶级文化大革命越是接近全面胜利，阶级斗争越是深刻，越是复杂。一小撮阶级敌人还妄图进行垂死挣扎。沈阳市革命工人代表大会决心在省、市革命委员会的领导下，带领全市工人阶级沿着毛主席的无产阶级革命路线乘胜前进，深入持久地开展革命大批判，做好清理阶级队伍的工作，向阶级敌人发动更猛烈的进攻；要搞好本单位的斗批改；进一步认真贯彻毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，迅速掀起抓革命、促生产的新高潮，努力完成和超额完成国家生产计划；爱护和支持革命委员会，支持和拥护人民解放军，在毛泽东思想的原则基础上，进一步巩固和发展按系统、按行业、按班级的革命大联合和革命三结合，加强工人阶级的坚强团结，加强军民之间的坚强团结，为夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利立新功。
      “大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想。”为了完成工人阶级在无产阶级文化大革命中的伟大历史使命，沈阳市工代会决定在全市工人中更加广泛深入地开展活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动，大力办好各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，深入开展无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于毛泽东思想，无限忠于毛主席无产阶级革命路线的“三忠于”活动，不断提高工人阶级的阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟。
    大会期间，辽宁省、沈阳市革命委员会和人民解放军沈阳部队，辽宁省军区的负责人出席了大会，并讲了话。
    大会在极其热烈的掌声和欢呼声中，通过了给伟大领袖毛主席的致敬电。
