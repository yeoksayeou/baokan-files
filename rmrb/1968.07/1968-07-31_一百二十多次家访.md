A cadre from the propaganda team, a comrade from the People's Liberation Army, does not rest even on Sundays, visiting workers' homes to do political and ideological work. He has now conducted over a hundred and twenty home visits.

On a Sunday afternoon, Comrade Guo Chuntang from the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team stationed at the Liaoning Steel Plant in Shenyang, to do the ideological work of a cadre from a mass organization, he braved the heat and hunger, running over twenty miles from the factory to a street in the city. He inquired with over forty households and searched for nearly three hours before finally finding the cadre of the mass organization, Li Xiangcai. Old Li, holding Guo Chuntang's hand, excitedly said, "Ah! I didn't give you the detailed address beforehand, causing you so much trouble. You are so busy with work, even on Sundays you don't rest, and you work so hard to help me. What can I say to express my gratitude!"

Since the establishment of the revolutionary committee at the Liaoning Steel Plant, Guo Chuntang has conducted over a hundred and twenty home visits. Visiting Li Xiangcai's home was one of these.

After arriving at the Liaoning Steel Plant, Guo Chuntang has always insisted on going deep among the masses to do political and ideological work. After the establishment of the new revolutionary government, the broad masses of workers have an even greater love, respect, and trust for the propaganda team stationed at the factory. Workers often come to the door, wanting to have a heart-to-heart talk with the comrades from the propaganda team. However, due to the heavy workload and limited time, some talks could not be had, and the workers felt that Xiao Guo was not as deeply involved as before. Guo Chuntang studied Chairman Mao's teachings: "Winning nationwide victory is but the first step in a long march of ten thousand li. The Chinese revolution is great, but the road after the revolution is longer, the work is greater, and more arduous." He thought, the workers have such trust in the revolutionary committee, and such love for the People's Liberation Army, we must often go deep among the masses, and be heart to heart with them, continue to maintain a humble, prudent, unarrogant, and unhurried attitude, only then can we wholeheartedly serve the people.

From then on, Guo Chuntang often went deep into the workshops, workers' dormitories, and workers' homes to do painstaking political and ideological work, having heart-to-heart talks with worker comrades, studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought together, engaging in revolutionary criticism together, and participating in labor together. As long as he was in the factory, he would go to the workshops every day, and often took out rest time to conduct home visits. While doing good political and ideological work among the masses, he also often actively sought help from worker comrades.

Once, he received a letter from home saying that his elder brother had passed away and asked him to return home immediately. He thought it over and over, came up with a plan to handle this matter, and then went to seek the help of the worker brothers in the rolling mill to enlighten himself. Seeing the worker comrades, he sincerely said, "Worker elder brothers, I have some active thoughts to report to you!" The workers were stunned, saying, "Comrade from the PLA! You are a propagandist of Mao Zedong Thought, and you are reporting active thoughts to us!" Guo Chuntang said, "The masses are the true heroes! We in the PLA must always learn from the working class, always learn from the masses!" The workers enthusiastically praised him, saying, "Xiao Guo is truly our confidant, if we don't chat with Xiao Guo for a few days, we feel quite uneasy!"

In the new situation, how to correctly treat the masses and maintain close ties with them? Guo Chuntang set three "unchangeables" for himself: The higher the prestige of the PLA, the more right to speak, the attitude of humbly accepting criticism and supervision from the masses does not change; After the establishment of the revolutionary committee, the style of going deep into the workshops every day to do political and ideological work does not change; No matter how great the achievements in work, the spirit of being humble, prudent, and working hard does not change. He deeply felt, "After the establishment of the revolutionary committee, in the matter of maintaining close ties with the masses, the masses coming to the door does not count as going deep among the masses, only actively going among the masses counts as going deep among the masses."

    一百二十多次家访
    一位支工的解放军同志，星期天也不休息，到工人家庭中访问，做政治思想工作。现在，他已经进行了一百二十多次家访。
    一个星期天的中午，驻沈阳辽宁钢厂解放军毛泽东思想宣传队的郭春堂同志，为了做好一个群众组织负责人的思想工作，他不顾疲劳，冒着炎热，忍着饥饿，从工厂跑了二十多里地，来到城内一条街道上。他一共询问了四十多户人家，找了将近三个小时，才找见了这个群众组织的负责人李相才。老李握着郭春堂的手，激动地说：“哎呀！我事先也没有把门牌号码详细告诉你们，让你们费神了。你们平时工作那么忙，星期天也顾不得休息，不辞辛苦来帮助我，叫我说啥是好呢！”
    辽宁钢厂从成立革命委员会以后，郭春堂已经进行过一百二十多次家访了。访问李相才的家，就是一百二十多次家访中的一次。
    郭春堂来到辽宁钢厂以后，一直坚持深入群众，做政治思想工作。新生的革命政权成立以后，广大工人群众对驻厂毛泽东思想宣传队更加热爱，更加尊重，更加信任。工人们经常找上门来，想和宣传队的同志谈谈心。可是因为工作多，时间少，有的就谈不上，工人们感到小郭不象以前那样深入了。郭春堂学习了毛主席教导：“夺取全国胜利，这只是万里长征走完了第一步。……中国的革命是伟大的，但革命以后的路程更长，工作更伟大，更艰苦。”他想，工人们对革命委员会这样信任，对解放军这样热爱，我们只有经常深入到群众中去，和群众心心相连，继续保持谦虚、谨慎、不骄、不躁的作风，才能做到全心全意地为人民服务。
    从此以后，郭春堂就经常深入到车间、工人宿舍、工人家庭，去做艰苦细致的政治思想工作，和工人同志们促膝谈心，一起活学活用毛泽东思想，一起搞革命大批判，一起参加劳动。只要是他在工厂，每天就要到车间里去，还经常抽出休息时间进行家庭访问。在深入群众做好政治思想工作的同时，他还经常主动请求工人同志帮助自己。
    有一次，他接到家中来信说哥哥病故了，要他马上回家探望。他考虑来考虑去，想了一个处理这个问题的方案，就去找轧机车间的工人兄弟帮助启发自己。他见了工人同志们就恳切地说：“工人老大哥同志们，我有个活思想向你们汇报汇报吧！”工人们一听愣住了，说：“解放军同志哟！你是毛泽东思想宣传员，还向我们汇报活思想哩！”郭春堂说：“群众是真正的英雄嘛！我们解放军永远要向工人阶级学习，永远要向群众学习！”工人们热情地赞扬他说：“小郭真是我们的贴心人，几天不和小郭唠一唠，我们心里挺想得慌！”
    在新的形势下，怎样正确对待群众和密切联系群众？郭春堂给自己规定了“三不变”：解放军威信越高越有发言权，虚心接受群众批评和监督的态度不变；成立了革命委员会，每天深入车间做政治思想工作的作风不变；不论工作取得了怎样大的成绩，谦虚谨慎、艰苦奋斗的精神不变。他深有体会地说：“革委会成立后，在密切联系群众问题上，群众找上门来不算深入群众，主动到群众中去才算深入群众。”　　沈炮支
