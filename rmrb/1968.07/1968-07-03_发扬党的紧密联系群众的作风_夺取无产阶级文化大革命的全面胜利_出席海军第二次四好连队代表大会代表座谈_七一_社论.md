Just as the entire nation, military and civilians alike, are filled with revolutionary fervor, celebrating the 47th anniversary of the birth of the great, glorious, and correct Chinese Communist Party led by Comrade Mao Zedong, and just as the entire nation, military and civilians alike, are rejoicing with boundless joy at the happy moment when the great helmsman Chairman Mao receives military cadres, representatives from the second conference of model companies in the Navy, who have come from the front lines of national defense, held discussions on the "July 1" editorial. Everyone enthusiastically pointed out: This editorial conveys a series of instructions from the great leader Chairman Mao, deeply expounds on the great significance of carrying forward the Party's style of maintaining close ties with the masses in the current situation, and further points out the direction for us to achieve comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, consolidate and develop this victory, and complete the great historical mission of continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat.

	Maintaining Close Ties with the Masses
	Is a Style Consistently Advocated by the Great Leader Chairman Mao

Deputy Political Commissar Hou Jianhua of a certain unit of the East China Fleet, and Squad Leader Liu Bensheng of a certain unit of the South China Fleet, said: Maintaining close ties with the masses is a consistent thought of Chairman Mao and a fine style cultivated by Chairman Mao himself. Chairman Mao attaches great importance to the great role of the masses and has always taught the whole Party to follow the mass line and maintain close ties with the masses, never for a moment separating from the masses. Chairman Mao pointed out: "The people, and the people alone, are the motive force in the creation of world history." This is the best summary of historical materialism, and it is the fundamental starting point of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and his style of maintaining close ties with the masses. Only by seriously studying and thoroughly understanding Chairman Mao's brilliant thoughts can we effectively carry out Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and style.

The representatives seriously studied Chairman Mao's teachings on maintaining close ties with the masses and, in light of the practical struggle of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, felt even more strongly the extreme importance of carrying forward the Party's style of maintaining close ties with the masses. Comrades said: The style of maintaining close ties with the masses, cultivated under the personal guidance of Chairman Mao, is our Party's "family heirloom." The practice of the Chinese revolution proves that whether it was during the domestic revolutionary war, the War of Resistance Against Japan, or the War of Liberation, it was precisely because our Party followed Chairman Mao's teachings, relied closely on the broad masses of the people, and fought together with the people, that we overcame numerous difficulties, defeated powerful domestic and foreign enemies, and achieved one great victory after another. Today, as we continue the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat, we must inherit and carry forward this traditional style of our Party, pass down this "family heirloom" for thousands of generations, and pass it down forever!

During the high tide of revolutionary tours, Political Commissar Zhao Changcai of a certain ship, who had repeatedly received and transported Red Guards, said: The great leader Chairman Mao not only pointed out the direction of maintaining close ties with the masses in theory but also set a brilliant example of maintaining close ties with the masses in his great revolutionary practice. Chairman Mao trusts the masses the most, cares for the masses the most, respects the masses' initiative the most, and supports the masses' revolutionary movements the most, and he is heart to heart with the people. During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, Chairman Mao personally received and reviewed more than ten million Red Guards and revolutionary masses; recently, Chairman Mao has again received military cadres who came to Beijing to attend Mao Zedong Thought study classes, which is the most powerful proof. We must strive to learn Chairman Mao's brilliant instructions on maintaining close ties with the masses and, even more, learn from Chairman Mao's great practice of maintaining close ties with the masses, and forever maintain and carry forward our Party's fine style.

	Only by Maintaining and Carrying Forward the Party's Style of Maintaining Close Ties with the Masses
	Can We Carry Out Chairman Mao's Proletarian Revolutionary Line

Deputy Director Deng Hongkui of the Political Department of a certain unit of the North China Fleet, and Military Representative Li Changsheng of a certain unit of the Navy stationed at the East Is Red Shipbuilding Factory in Shanghai, said: The Party's line and the Party's style are inseparable. What kind of line there is, there will be what kind of style. Relying on the masses, believing in the masses, and maintaining close ties with the masses, serving the people wholeheartedly, is the core of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and also the traditional style advocated by our Party. Chairman Mao attaches great importance to the issue of cultivating the Party's style, regarding maintaining and carrying forward the Party's traditional style as an important guarantee for uniting the whole Party and the broad masses of the people, overcoming difficulties, defeating the enemy, and developing victories. In each historical period of the Chinese revolution, at every crucial moment of achieving great victories, Chairman Mao not only formulated a complete set of revolutionary theories, lines, policies, and principles for us but also proposed the issue of establishing a correct style. Twenty-three years ago, at the Seventh National Congress of the Party, Chairman Mao summarized the famous three great styles of our Party for the whole Party: "the style of combining theory with practice, the style of maintaining close ties with the masses, and the style of self-criticism." On the eve of winning the country, at the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee, Chairman Mao again admonished the whole Party: "We must ensure that comrades continue to maintain the style of modesty, prudence, and not being arrogant or hasty, and we must ensure that comrades continue to maintain the style of hard struggle." It is precisely because the whole Party has carried out Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and carried forward the revolutionary style consistently advocated by Chairman Mao that the victory of the Chinese revolution has been guaranteed.

At this crucial moment of achieving comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, Chairman Mao repeatedly teaches us: We must distinguish between the style of the Communist Party and the style of the Kuomintang. In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the revolutionary masses of the proletariat firmly stood on the side of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, maintained close ties with the masses, united the masses, and always directed the spearhead of the struggle at the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party. On the contrary, the handful of capitalist roaders, with China's Khrushchev as the head, distorted right and wrong, confused black and white, and fiercely suppressed the revolutionary masses, attempting to suppress the magnificent Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The line they stubbornly pushed was a complete set of counter-revolutionary revisionist lines, and the style they practiced was the Kuomintang style of departing from the masses and suppressing the masses.

Comrades pointed out: The practice of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution once again proves: Only by maintaining and carrying forward the Party's style of maintaining close ties with the masses can we truly carry out Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, and implement Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions. Without a correct revolutionary style, Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line cannot be smoothly carried out, and Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and series of latest instructions cannot be turned into the actual actions of the broad masses. The issue of style is not just a general work method issue; it is a major issue of standing on what position and carrying out what line, and it is a fundamental issue of whether one is loyal to Chairman Mao, Mao Zedong Thought, and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

	Firmly Protect the Broad Masses of the People
	And Resolutely Strike at a Handful of Class Enemies

Captain Chen Yunhe of the "Pioneer Boat" on the sea, Deputy Squad Leader Wang Wentang of a certain naval aviation school, and Squad Leader Ge Xinda of a certain naval navigation team, said: Chairman Mao recently instructed us: "Whether to protect or suppress the broad masses of the people is the fundamental difference between the Communist Party and the Kuomintang, the fundamental difference between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, and the fundamental difference between the dictatorship of the proletariat and the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie." Currently, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has achieved decisive victories. Mao Zedong Thought and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line have been grasped by the broad revolutionary masses. In most regions of the country, revolutionary committees have been generally established. However, class struggle is still sharp and complex. A handful of class enemies are unwilling to accept their defeat and are trying every means to sabotage the newly born revolutionary committees, disrupt and sabotage the relationship between the revolutionary committees and the masses, and disrupt and sabotage the relationship between the people's army and the masses. In this situation, it is of great importance to firmly carry out Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, vigorously carry forward the Party's style of maintaining close ties with the masses, resolutely rely on and protect the broad masses of the people, correctly distinguish and handle two types of different contradictions, and accurately and firmly strike at a small number of class enemies.

Comrades pointed out: In the new situation, an important means for China's Khrushchev and his gang to sabotage the newly born revolutionary committees is to fire sugar-coated bullets, attempting to infiltrate and corrupt our comrades with bourgeois ideas and styles, making the members of the revolutionary committees depart from the masses, become officials, and even "peacefully evolve," thus changing the nature of the revolutionary committees. Among our comrades, some have paid attention to maintaining ties with the masses in the past when they were persecuted by the bourgeois reactionary line and in difficult environments. However, after the revolutionary masses of the proletariat achieved decisive victories and established revolutionary committees, they may neglect the issue of maintaining ties with the masses, gradually develop the bourgeois style of departing from the masses, and even be hit by the sugar-coated bullets of the class enemies. This is very dangerous. We must maintain a clear understanding and be highly vigilant about this new feature of class struggle in the new situation.

Comrades unanimously believe: Whether the members of the revolutionary committees, whether they are old revolutionary cadres or new cadres who have emerged in the Cultural Revolution, can follow Chairman Mao's instructions and always maintain ties with the masses is a fundamental issue of whether the newly born revolutionary committees can be consolidated and developed and whether the power of the proletarian dictatorship will change color. We, who participate in the work of the revolutionary committees and carry out the "three supports, two militaries" tasks, must, together with the representatives of the revolutionary masses and the representatives of revolutionary leading cadres, seriously carry out the Party's style of maintaining close ties with the masses, maintain the broadest and most frequent contact with the working people, deeply root ourselves among the masses, and only in this way can we build the revolutionary committees into a truly revolutionary, authoritative, and vigorous proletarian command center, and only in this way can we well complete the glorious tasks of "three supports, two militaries" entrusted to us by Chairman Mao.

	Arming Ourselves with Chairman Mao's Great Thoughts and Revolutionary Style
	To Complete the Historical Mission of Continuing the Revolution Under the Dictatorship of the Proletariat

Captain Jiang Yuanshen of the 441st Unit of the Navy, and Instructor Fang Zeqing of a certain radar station of the Navy, said: The correct line and the correct style are formed and developed in the struggle against the wrong line and the wrong style. Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and style are precisely developed and enriched in the long-term revolutionary struggle and in the struggle against right and "left" opportunism. In the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, in the criticism of the whole set of bourgeois reactionary lines pushed by a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party and the Kuomintang style of departing from the people and suppressing the masses, the Party's fine style of maintaining close ties with the masses has been greatly developed and demonstrated its great power. After this great revolutionary mass movement, as pointed out in the editorial: Our Party has greatly strengthened its ties with the masses and is becoming more pure, more solid, and more vigorous.

Facing the great situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the representatives unanimously expressed: We must follow Chairman Mao's teachings, maintain and carry forward the Party's fine style of maintaining close ties with the masses, and bring this style into the revolutionary committees, into the "three supports, two militaries," and into all work, and together with the broad revolutionary masses, carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution initiated and led by Chairman Mao to the end!

The representatives emphasized: Chairman Mao is the representative of the masses, and Mao Zedong Thought is the soul of the masses; Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line concentrates the interests and demands of the masses. The most important thing in maintaining and carrying forward the Party's style of maintaining close ties with the masses is to seriously study Chairman Mao's great thoughts and great practice, strive to arm ourselves with Mao Zedong Thought, and truly implement it in action.

Maintaining and carrying forward the Party's style of maintaining close ties with the masses means throwing ourselves into the great waves of the masses' struggle, experiencing wind and rain with the masses. In the practical struggle, truly understanding Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, tempering and cultivating the style of maintaining close ties with the masses. In the masses' struggle, changing one's worldview according to Mao Zedong Thought, humbly accepting the masses' criticism and supervision, constantly eliminating the bourgeois dust in one's mind, and constantly improving class struggle awareness and line struggle awareness.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The Party organization should be composed of advanced elements of the proletariat and should be a vigorous vanguard organization that can lead the proletariat and revolutionary masses in their struggle against the class enemy." On this glorious day of commemorating the 47th anniversary of our Party's birth, the representatives decided to better study and apply Mao Zedong Thought, strive to temper themselves into advanced elements of the proletariat, forever follow Chairman Mao, and contribute to completing the great historical mission of continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat.

    发扬党的紧密联系群众的作风
    夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利
    出席海军第二次四好连队代表大会代表座谈“七一”社论
    正当全国军民，满怀革命激情，欢庆以毛泽东同志为领袖的伟大、光荣、正确的中国共产党诞生四十七周年的时候，正当全国军民以无比喜悦的心情，热烈欢呼伟大统帅毛主席接见部队干部的幸福时刻，来自海防前线参加海军第二次四好连队代表大会的代表纷纷举行座谈，认真地学习和讨论了《人民日报》、《红旗》杂志、《解放军报》在七月一日发表的重要社论。大家兴奋地指出：这篇社论传达了伟大领袖毛主席的一系列指示，深刻地阐明了在当前形势下发扬党的紧密联系群众的作风的重大意义，为我们夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利，巩固和发展这个胜利，完成在无产阶级专政下继续革命的伟大历史使命，进一步指明了前进的方向。
          紧密联系群众
    是伟大领袖毛主席一贯倡导的作风
    海军东海舰队某部副政委侯建华、南海舰队某部中队长刘本生等同志说：密切联系群众，是毛主席一贯的思想，是毛主席亲自培育的我们党的优良作风。毛主席非常重视人民群众的伟大作用，一贯教导全党要实行群众路线，和人民群众紧密地联系在一起，一时一刻也不要脱离群众。毛主席指出：“人民，只有人民，才是创造世界历史的动力。”这是对马克思主义历史唯物主义的最好的概括，是毛主席的无产阶级革命路线和紧密联系群众的作风的最根本的出发点。只有认真学习和透彻领会毛主席的这一光辉思想，我们才能够很好地贯彻执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线和革命作风。
    代表们认真学习了毛主席历来关于密切联系群众的教导，联系到无产阶级文化大革命的斗争实践，更加体会到发扬党的紧密联系群众的作风的极端重要性。同志们说：在毛主席亲自培育下形成的紧密联系群众的作风，是我们党的“传家宝”。中国革命斗争的实践证明，不论是在国内革命战争时期，抗日战争时期还是解放战争时期，正因为我们党遵照毛主席的教导，紧紧地依靠了广大人民群众，和人民群众团结在一起，战斗在一起，才克服了重重困难，战胜了国内外强大的敌人，取得了一个又一个的伟大胜利。在无产阶级专政下继续进行革命的今天，我们一定要继承和发扬党的这个传统作风，把这个“传家宝”千秋万代地传下去，永远传下去！
    在革命大串连的高潮中，曾经多次接待、运送红卫兵小将的某舰政委赵长才同志说：伟大领袖毛主席，不但在理论上给我们指明了密切联系群众的方向，而且在他老人家的伟大革命实践中，为我们树立了紧密联系群众的最光辉的典范。毛主席最相信群众，最关心群众，最尊重群众的首创精神，最支持群众的革命运动，和人民群众心连心。在无产阶级文化大革命期间，毛主席亲自接见和检阅了一千多万红卫兵小将和革命群众；最近，毛主席又多次接见了来京参加毛泽东思想学习班的部队干部，就是最有力的证明。我们要努力学习毛主席关于紧密联系群众的光辉指示，更要努力学习毛主席紧密联系群众的伟大实践，永远保持和发扬党的优良作风。
  只有保持和发扬党的紧密联系群众的作风
  才能贯彻执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线
    北海舰队某部政治部副主任邓洪奎、海军某部驻上海东方红造船厂军代表李长胜等同志说：党的路线和党的作风是分不开的。有什么样的路线，必然产生什么样的作风。依靠群众，相信群众，和人民群众紧密地联系在一起，全心全意为人民服务，是毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的核心，也是毛主席倡导的我们党的传统作风。毛主席非常重视培养党的作风的问题，把保持和发扬党的传统作风，看作是团结全党和广大人民群众，克服困难，战胜敌人，发展胜利的重要保证。在中国革命的各个历史时期，在每一个夺取伟大胜利的关键时刻，毛主席不仅为我们制定了一整套革命的理论、路线、方针和政策，同时也提出了树立正确作风的问题。二十三年前，在党的第七次全国代表大会上，毛主席就向全党概述了著名的党的三大作风——“理论和实践相结合的作风，和人民群众紧密地联系在一起的作风以及自我批评的作风。”在夺取全国胜利的前夕，毛主席在党的七届二中全会上，又告诫全党：“务必使同志们继续地保持谦虚、谨慎、不骄、不躁的作风，务必使同志们继续地保持艰苦奋斗的作风。”正是由于全党同志贯彻执行了毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，发扬了毛主席一贯倡导的革命作风，才保证了中国革命的胜利。
    在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的关键时刻，毛主席反复教导我们：要分清什么是共产党的作风，什么是国民党的作风。在无产阶级文化大革命运动中，无产阶级革命派坚定地站在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线一边，紧密地联系群众，团结群众，把斗争的矛头始终指向党内一小撮走资派。相反地，以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的一小撮走资派，颠倒是非，混淆黑白，疯狂地镇压革命群众，妄图将轰轰烈烈的无产阶级文化大革命打下去。他们顽固推行的是一整套反革命的修正主义路线，他们搞的一套作风，就是背离群众、镇压群众的国民党作风。
    同志们指出：无产阶级文化大革命的实践再一次证明：只有保持和发扬党的紧密联系群众的作风，才能真正贯彻毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，落实毛主席的一系列最新指示。没有一个正确的革命的作风，毛主席的无产阶级革命路线就不可能顺利地得到贯彻，毛主席的伟大战略部署和一系列最新指示，就不可能变成广大群众的实际行动。作风问题决不是一般的工作方法问题，而是站在什么立场，执行什么路线的重大问题，是忠不忠于毛主席、毛泽东思想、毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的根本问题。
    坚决保护广大人民群众
      狠狠打击一小撮阶级敌人
    “海上先锋艇”艇长陈运和、海军某航校副中队长王文堂、海军某部航标队队长葛新大等同志说：毛主席最近指示我们：“对广大人民群众是保护还是镇压，是共产党同国民党的根本区别，是无产阶级同资产阶级的根本区别，是无产阶级专政同资产阶级专政的根本区别。”当前，无产阶级文化大革命已经取得决定性胜利。毛泽东思想、毛主席的无产阶级革命路线已经为广大革命群众所掌握。在全国绝大多数地区，各级革命委员会已经普遍地建立起来了。但是，阶级斗争还是尖锐而复杂的。一小撮阶级敌人不甘心于自己的失败，他们千方百计地企图破坏新生的革命委员会，离间和破坏革命委员会同群众的关系，离间和破坏人民军队同群众的关系。在这种形势下，坚定不移地执行毛主席的革命路线，大力发扬党的紧密联系群众的作风，坚决依靠和保护广大人民群众，正确地区分和处理两类不同性质的矛盾，稳、准、狠地打击极少数的阶级敌人，具有十分重要的意义。
    同志们指出：在新的形势下，中国赫鲁晓夫及其一伙破坏新生的革命委员会的一个重要手段，就是施放糖衣炮弹，妄图用资产阶级的思想、作风侵袭和腐蚀我们的同志，使革命委员会的成员脱离群众，做官当老爷，甚至“和平演变”过去，从而改变革命委员会的性质。在我们的同志中，有些人过去在资产阶级反动路线迫害下，在艰苦困难的环境里，比较注意联系群众。但是，在无产阶级革命派取得了决定性胜利，建立起革命委员会以后，就可能忽视联系群众的问题，逐渐滋长脱离群众的资产阶级作风，甚至可能被阶级敌人的糖衣炮弹打中。这是十分危险的。对于这个新形势下阶级斗争的新特点，我们必须保持清醒的认识，引起高度的警惕。
    同志们一致认为：革命委员会的成员，不论是革命的老干部，还是在文化大革命运动中涌现出来的新干部，能不能遵照毛主席的指示，永远保持和群众的血肉联系，这是关系到新生的革命委员会能不能巩固和发展，无产阶级专政的政权会不会改变颜色的根本问题。我们参加革委会工作和执行“三支”、“两军”任务的同志，只有同革命群众的代表、革命领导干部的代表一起，认真贯彻党的紧密联系群众的作风，同劳动人民保持最广泛的、经常的联系，深深地扎根于群众之中，才能把革命委员会建设成真正革命的、有无产阶级权威的、朝气蓬勃的战斗指挥部，才能很好地完成毛主席交给我们的“三支”、“两军”的光荣任务。
    用毛主席的伟大思想和革命作风武装自己，完成无产阶级专政下继续革命的历史使命
    海军四四一一部队部队长姜元臣、海军某雷达站指导员房泽庆等同志说：正确的路线和正确的作风是在同错误的路线和错误的作风进行斗争中形成和发展起来的。毛主席的无产阶级革命路线和革命作风，就是在长期革命斗争中，在同右的和“左”的机会主义进行斗争中不断发展，不断丰富的。在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命的群众运动中，在批判了党内一小撮走资派推行的一整套资产阶级反动路线和背离人民，镇压群众的国民党作风中，党的紧密联系群众的优良作风，得到了极大的发展，显示出巨大的威力。经过这场伟大的革命群众运动的锻炼，正象社论中指出的：我们的党，和群众的联系极大地加强了，正在变得更加纯洁、更加坚强、更加朝气蓬勃。
    面对着无产阶级文化大革命的一片大好形势，代表们一致表示：一定要遵照毛主席的教导，保持和发扬党的紧密联系群众的优良作风，并且把这个作风带到革命委员会中去，带到“三支”、“两军”和一切工作中去，和广大革命群众一起，把毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
    代表们强调指出：毛主席是群众的代表，毛泽东思想是群众的灵魂；毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，集中反映了群众的利益和要求。保持和发扬党的紧密联系群众的作风，最重要的一条，就是要认真学习毛主席的伟大思想和伟大实践，努力用毛泽东思想武装自己的头脑，并且真正落实在行动上。
    保持和发扬党的紧密联系群众的作风，就要投身到群众斗争的大风大浪中，同群众一道经风雨，见世面。在斗争实践中，真正理解毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，锻炼和培养紧密联系群众的作风。在群众斗争中，按照毛泽东思想改造自己的世界观，虚心接受群众的批评和监督，不断清除头脑里的资产阶级的灰尘，不断提高阶级斗争觉悟和路线斗争觉悟。
    毛主席教导我们：“党组织应是无产阶级先进分子所组成，应能领导无产阶级和革命群众对于阶级敌人进行战斗的朝气蓬勃的先锋队组织。”代表们在纪念我们党诞生四十七周年的光辉日子里，决心更好地活学活用毛泽东思想，努力把自己锻炼成为无产阶级的先进分子，永远紧跟毛主席，为完成在无产阶级专政下继续进行革命的伟大历史使命做出贡献。
