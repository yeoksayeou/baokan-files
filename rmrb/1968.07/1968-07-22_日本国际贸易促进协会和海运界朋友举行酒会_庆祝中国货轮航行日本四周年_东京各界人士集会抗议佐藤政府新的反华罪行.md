The Japanese International Trade Promotion Association and friends from the maritime industry held a banquet on the afternoon of the 18th in Tokyo to enthusiastically celebrate the fourth anniversary of the ships of the China Ocean Shipping Company sailing to Japan.

The ship captain Lin Zuyi of the Chinese cargo ship "Dongfeng," which was docked in Yokohama, and the crew were invited to attend the banquet.

The guests and hosts repeatedly raised their glasses to toast the long life of the great leader Chairman Mao.

In his speech, the executive director of the Japanese International Trade Promotion Association, Hagiwara Teiji, said that the ships of the China Ocean Shipping Company were able to sail to Japan as a result of the continuous struggle of the peoples of the two countries against the reactionary forces of Japan and the United States.

Hagiwara said that despite the obstruction and sabotage by U.S. imperialism, the Japanese Sato government, Soviet modern revisionism, and the Miyamoto revisionist clique, the Chinese sailors overcame countless difficulties and made great contributions to strengthening the friendly cause and trade relations between the peoples of the two countries.

Hagiwara enthusiastically praised the great victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by the great leader Chairman Mao, and said that it is now marching towards complete victory.

Hagiwara expressed that the Japanese people must struggle to abolish the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty."

Hagiwara concluded with a shout: "Long live the great leader of the world's people, Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand, ten thousand years!"

The representative of the Japanese International Trade Promotion Association's Ship Department, Kami Nakamaru, spoke, condemning the Japanese Sato government's policy of hostility towards China, and stated that all Japanese trade and maritime industry personnel who maintain friendship with China must adhere to the political three principles of Sino-Japanese relations and the principle of the inseparability of politics and economics, and strive to promote the normalization of Sino-Japanese relations.

Captain Lin Zuyi of the "Dongfeng" spoke on behalf of the China Ocean Shipping Company and the entire crew of the "Dongfeng," expressing gratitude to the broad Japanese friends for their enthusiastic assistance and care over the past four years for the Chinese cargo ships.

Staff from the China-Japan Memorandum Trade Office's liaison office in Tokyo were also invited to attend the banquet.

According to a report from the New China News Agency on the 21st, Tokyo: On the afternoon of the 20th, more than 200 people from various circles in Tokyo held an emergency meeting to strongly protest the unreasonable obstruction by the Sato reactionary government of the crew of the Chinese cargo ship "Dongfeng," which was docked in Yokohama, from going to Tokyo to participate in the celebration of the fourth anniversary of Chinese ships sailing to Japan.

On the 20th, the Japanese International Trade Promotion Association, with the assistance of the Japan-China Friendship Association (orthodox), the Tokyo branch of the Japan-China Friendship Association (orthodox), and the Tokyo Chinese Chamber of Commerce, prepared to hold a celebration to commemorate the fourth anniversary of Chinese ships sailing to Japan.

The crew of the Chinese cargo ship "Dongfeng," which was docked in Yokohama, received the invitation. They submitted an application to the Japanese authorities three days before the celebration to go ashore to Tokyo, preparing to attend the celebration.

In the early afternoon of the 20th, Japanese friends began to gather at the "Hamaryu Palace" park in Tokyo. Holding the revolutionary classic "Quotations from Chairman Mao," they eagerly awaited the arrival of the Chinese sailors. At this moment, news came that the Sato government of Japan unreasonably obstructed the Chinese sailors from going ashore to Tokyo to participate in the celebration. The people were filled with righteous indignation and immediately changed the celebration into a protest meeting against the Sato government.

The Japanese friends who attended the meeting spoke one after another, angrily condemning the Sato government's latest unforgivable serious crime of obstructing Sino-Japanese friendship and Sino-Japanese trade.

The attendees expressed that they would unite more broadly with the Japanese people and carry on the struggle against the Sato government's policy of hostility towards China to the end. They also repeatedly shouted: "Get out of Japan, American imperialists!" "Down with the Sato cabinet!" "Resolutely oppose the Sato government's hostility towards China!" "Resolutely smash the Japan-U.S. 'Security Treaty'!" "Long live the fighting friendship between the peoples of China and Japan!" "Long live the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China!" "Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!" "Long live the great leader Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand, ten thousand years!"

The Japanese Revolutionary Theater Group, the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team, also expressed their indignation at the sabotage of Sino-Japanese friendly relations by the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries through revolutionary art performances.

After the meeting, the people organized and marched to Yokohama Port to demonstrate and protest to the Japanese authorities.

    据新华社二十一日讯　东京消息：日本国际贸易促进协会和日本海运界的朋友，十八日下午在东京举行酒会，热烈庆祝中国远洋运输公司的船舶航行日本四周年。
    正在横滨港停泊的中国货船“东风”轮船长林祖乙和船员应邀出席了酒会。
    宾主在酒会上不断举杯敬祝伟大领袖毛主席万寿无疆。
    日本国际贸易促进协会专务理事萩原定司在讲话中说，中国远洋运输公司的船舶能够航行日本，是日中两国人民同美日反动派不断进行斗争的结果。
    萩原说，在美帝国主义、日本佐藤政府、苏联现代修正主义和宫本修正主义集团阻挠和破坏日中友好和日中贸易的情况下，中国船员排除万难，为加强日中两国人民的友好事业和贸易往来做出了巨大贡献。
    萩原热情赞扬伟大领袖毛主席亲自发动和领导的中国无产阶级文化大革命已经取得决定性胜利，并正在走向全面胜利。
    萩原表示，日本人民必须为废除日美“安全条约”而奋斗。
    萩原最后高呼：“世界人民的伟大领袖毛主席万岁，万岁，万万岁！”
    日本国际贸易促进协会船舶部代表干事上中龙男讲话，谴责日本佐藤政府采取敌视中国的政策，并且表示，一切维护日中友好的日本贸易界和海运界人士都必须坚持日中关系的政治三原则和政治、经济不可分的原则，为促进日中关系的正常化而努力。
      “东风”轮船长林祖乙在讲话中代表中国远洋运输公司和“东风”轮全体船员，对广大日本朋友四年来对中国货船的热情协助和关怀表示感谢。
    中国中日备忘录贸易办事处驻东京联络处工作人员也应邀出席了酒会。
    据新华社二十一日讯　东京消息：日本东京各界人士二百多人二十日下午举行紧急集会，强烈抗议佐藤反动政府无理阻挠停泊在横滨港的中国货轮“东风”号的船员前往东京参加庆祝中国船舶航行日本四周年联欢会。
    二十日这天，日本国际贸易促进协会在日中友协（正统）总部、日中友协（正统）东京都总部、东京华侨总会等团体的协助下，准备举行联欢会，庆祝中国船舶航行日本四周年。
    正在横滨港停泊的中国货轮“东风”号的船员们接到了邀请，他们在举行庆祝活动的三天前，就向日本当局提出了下船前往东京的申请，准备出席联欢会。
    二十日下午两点多钟，日本朋友陆续来到东京的“滨离宫”公园。人们手拿革命宝书《毛主席语录》，热切地盼望着中国船员的到来。正在这个时候，传来了日本佐藤政府无理阻挠中国船员下船前来东京参加联欢会的消息，于是人们义愤填膺，立即把联欢会改为对佐藤政府的抗议集会。
    到会的日本朋友纷纷发言，愤怒谴责日本佐藤亲美反动政府破坏日中友好和日中贸易的又一个不可饶恕的严重罪行。
    到会群众表示，他们将更加广泛地团结日本人民，把反对佐藤政府推行敌视中国政策的斗争进行到底。他们还不断高呼：“美国佬从日本滚出去！”“打倒佐藤内阁！”“坚决反对佐藤政府敌视中国！”“坚决粉碎日美‘安全条约’！”“日中两国人民的战斗友谊万岁！”“中国无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利万岁！”“战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！”“伟大领袖毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！”
    出席集会的日本革命剧团齿轮座的毛泽东思想宣传队还通过表演革命文艺节目，表达了他们对美日反动派破坏日中友好事业的无比愤怒。
    集会结束以后，人们还组织起来，前往横滨港，向日本当局进行示威和抗议。
