Edition: 4

The reform of state organs is fundamentally about maintaining close ties with the masses. The Party Committee of a certain unit in the People's Liberation Army Navy, which is an advanced collective in studying the works of Chairman Mao and a red flag in defending Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, along with its leadership of the headquarters, political department, and logistics department, follows the teachings of the great leader Chairman Mao, maintaining and carrying forward the Party's fine tradition of maintaining close ties with the masses, never for a moment separating from the masses, and becoming a combat command center leading the masses to forge ahead bravely.

With fervent enthusiasm, they go among the masses,
And take root among the masses.

This unit is stationed at the forefront of the South China Sea. The heroic soldiers of the People's Liberation Army guard the long coastline day and night, vigilantly protecting the southern gate of our motherland, protecting the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and protecting Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. The leaders and staff of this unit live, fight, and share a deep bond with these soldiers who are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao.

On the morning of this year's Spring Festival, the leaders got up and went to the troops. They had a bitter meal with the soldiers and criticized the heinous crimes of China's Khrushchev. A deputy commander recalled the bitter life of the old society, "Landlords drink the blood of tenants, piles of white bones lie in the wilderness." Many soldiers' tears fell into the bitter vegetables in their bowls. The deputy commander angrily said, "This is what China's Khrushchev advocates as 'exploitation is beneficial'!" He firmly declared that he would always remember Chairman Mao's teaching, "Never forget class struggle," never forget the bitterness of past class oppression, always think of today's sweetness, and carry the Chinese revolution and the world revolution to the end. At this moment, faces streaked with tears looked up at the great leader Chairman Mao's portrait, and countless words converged into one sentence, unanimously wishing Chairman Mao longevity! Bowl after bowl of bitter vegetables and past bitterness bound the leaders and soldiers together, heart to heart, standing on Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

That night, the political commissar returned from the warship but couldn't sleep. It was already midnight, and he was still thinking: What are the soldiers doing now? What are they thinking? Today, after recalling the bitterness with the soldiers, what reaction did they have? He got out of bed and went back to the ship. A small oil lamp attracted him, and upon entering, he saw the soldier Bian Jia'ai deeply engrossed in studying "Analysis of the Classes in Chinese Society." Seeing the political commissar, Bian Jia'ai, with tears in his eyes, held up Chairman Mao's works and said excitedly, "Commissar, I will always remember Chairman Mao's teachings, never forget class struggle, and never forget the dictatorship of the proletariat."

The great leader Chairman Mao teaches, "We must never separate from the masses. In this way, we can know the masses, understand the masses, and work together with the masses, and thus can truly serve the people." The leaders and staff here follow Chairman Mao's teachings, never forgetting the masses, always paying attention to understanding the masses, and always being among the masses.

Here, at the start of each day's work, the leaders and staff are either on the warship, in the mess hall, in the livestock barn, or in the guard platoon, studying and applying Chairman Mao's works with the soldiers, singing "The East is Red" passionately, and wishing the great leader Chairman Mao longevity.

Here, whenever Chairman Mao's latest instructions are received, they do not eat or sleep but quickly convey Chairman Mao's latest instructions to the soldiers' hearts. On the day Chairman Mao inspected North China, Central China, and East China and issued important instructions, it was already late at night when the lights were about to be turned off. They immediately conveyed the instructions to each unit and printed them overnight. The next morning, they delivered Chairman Mao's latest instructions to the soldiers and nearby commune members.

Every battle order from Chairman Mao is carried out here with lightning speed. The call for revolutionary criticism was sounded, and the leaders and staff, except those on duty, carried their bags to the grassroots units and, together with the soldiers, fiercely criticized China's Khrushchev and the counter-revolutionary revisionist elements Peng Dehuai and Luo Ronghui's counter-revolutionary revisionist line. One day, a Party Committee member on Ship No. 1 was criticizing China's Khrushchev's reactionary fallacies spread in 1955, "Only by mastering technology can we defend the country." He then received a request from the soldiers on Ship No. 2 to participate in the criticism of the great conspirator and great schemer Luo Ronghui's reactionary bourgeois military line. The Party Committee member immediately went to Ship No. 2 and, together with the soldiers, refuted Luo Ronghui's reactionary fallacies such as "technology first" and "elite first," making the revolutionary criticism deeper and deeper.

Here, the leaders and staff always think of the soldiers, sharing their urgencies and needs. When the soldiers consider how to study and apply Mao Zedong Thought in the great waves of class struggle, they promptly summarized and promoted the advanced experience of Guo Yan, an active participant in the "Three Supports, Two Militant" work who studied Chairman Mao's works. When revolutionary criticism needs to be deepened, they promptly introduced the method of Ship No. 2, where every week a counter-revolutionary revisionist fallacy is selected, and the masses are mobilized to repeatedly criticize it with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, making every reactionary viewpoint of China's Khrushchev and a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party thoroughly criticized.

Here, as soon as a new cadre arrives, the leaders take them to the grassroots, studying the "Three Articles" and Chairman Mao's teachings on maintaining close ties with the masses with them, making them one with the soldiers. Here, soldiers are familiar with the cadres, and cadres understand the soldiers. During holidays, soldiers go to the headquarters in groups of threes and fours to chat with the cadres, and the cadres also frequently go to the docks to chat with the soldiers. The entire leadership is like a blazing political flame, burning among the masses at all times.

Honestly, they become the students of the masses.

"To be the teacher of the people, one must first be the student of the people." The leaders and staff of this unit follow Chairman Mao's teachings, establishing the correct attitude towards the masses. They are not satisfied with eating, living, studying, speaking, laboring, and criticizing the bourgeoisie with the masses. They also regard the masses as their teachers and learn from the masses. They say: To truly never separate from the masses for a moment, one must adopt a revolutionary attitude towards the masses, be willing to be the students of the masses, and sincerely and wholeheartedly learn from the masses.

One day in August, the scorching sun of the south made the deck of the warship hot. The staff member Zhou Weidong was stationed on a warship. That day, after the ship returned from sea training, it needed to clean the soot-blackened interior of the torpedo launch tube. Zhou Weidong, without consulting the torpedo soldiers, took off his clothes and crawled into the torpedo launch tube to start cleaning. The temperature inside the tube was high, very stuffy, and the soot was choking. Soon after entering, his skin turned red. The torpedo soldiers poured seawater onto the launch tube to lower the internal temperature. After cleaning, Zhou Weidong was sweating all over, covered in oil and dirt, and still did not pass the inspection. That night, Zhou Weidong had a heart-to-heart talk with the torpedo soldiers, who hoped Zhou Weidong would study the "Three Articles." Zhou Weidong studied the "Three Articles" and found that his motivation for doing this was impure, thinking that as a staff member, he should set an example for the soldiers to see, forgetting that he was first and foremost an ordinary soldier.

The fact that the staff members went to the troops taught Zhou Weidong a lesson. During the daily reading, he exposed this private thought to the soldiers and fought against this "private" self. He said, "The thought revolutionization of the staff members is not about revolutionizing others first but about revolutionizing oneself first. Only by first becoming the student of the masses and fighting against one's individualism can one truly become an ordinary soldier." The torpedo soldiers were deeply moved by Zhou Weidong's self-criticism. Not only did he teach Zhou Weidong the cleaning method, but he also shared his experience of not wanting to be a torpedo soldier to loving being a torpedo soldier, becoming a five-good soldier, and an active participant in studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought. The two became heart-to-heart "red pairs."

The leaders here appear among the masses with the attitude of students, absorbing nutrients from the masses. One day, the commander went to a company and listened to a mechanic introduce his experience of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought in the struggle of the masses. He was deeply inspired. That night, he went to the ship to visit this mechanic as a teacher, having an intimate talk, and carefully reading the mechanic's study notes. He deeply understood the significance of Chairman Mao's teaching of going to the struggle of the masses to experience the wind and rain and see the world from this mechanic's deeds, feeling that his understanding of Chairman Mao's great instruction was not as profound and sincere as this mechanic's. Deep into the night, this old cadre who followed Chairman Mao in countless battles was still under the lamp, concentrating on studying Chairman Mao's works and the soldiers' study notes, copying the soldiers' new thoughts and new language into his own study notebook. To truly learn the soldiers' loyalty to Chairman Mao, he visited this mechanic four times, and not once did he tell this soldier, "You not only taught me how to deepen proletarian feelings among the people, but you also contributed good ideas and experiences to the revolutionary construction of the unit."

This leader learned from this soldier, was educated by him, and actively promoted this soldier's experience, leading the cadres to the struggle of the masses to experience the wind and rain and see the world. During the drought struggle, he led the staff members to the countryside and, together with the people, studied and applied Mao Zedong Thought. During the intense struggle between the two lines, he led the cadres, soldiers, workers, and family members, carrying their luggage, to factories and countryside for political camping, working and studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought with workers, peasants, and students, and criticizing the bourgeoisie together, promoting the thought revolutionization of the unit. After this, whenever the unit conducted class education or promoted new cadres, they had to go to the countryside or state farms for political camping or social investigation, participating in the fiery class struggle with the people.

Such incidents of regarding the masses as teachers and willingly being the students of the masses have become a good tradition in this leadership. They deeply feel from practice that honestly and willingly being the students of the masses is a profound thought revolution and a lifelong matter for every cadre. If you are the student of the masses today, you have revolutionary vigor; if you do not willingly be the student tomorrow, your thoughts and feelings will change, and you will stagnate, and the unit will breed bureaucratism, and the cadres will become "masters." They say: The more consciously one willingly becomes the student of the masses, the more one learns, the greater one's ability, and the more one contributes to the people. The more honestly and willingly one becomes the student of the masses, the more one's heart is connected with the soldiers, the more one's loyalty to Chairman Mao is rooted deeply in one's soul, and the redder one's heart becomes.

Sincerely and humbly accepting the masses' criticism.

This unit's Party Committee and leadership can achieve never separating from the masses for a moment, also because they are good at listening to the masses' opinions, daring to make more self-criticisms, being humble and cautious, and regarding listening to the masses' criticism as the greatest loyalty to Chairman Mao.

One day, a deputy political commissar went to the machine repair shop and had a heart-to-heart talk with an old worker. The old worker said, "How do I not know you? Where are you from?" This incident caused a struggle in the mind of this leader. He thought: I have been in this unit for several years, why don't the old workers recognize me? He brought the question back and repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's teachings: "People's work is different, and their positions are different, but no matter how high the position, one must appear among the people as an ordinary laborer." Chairman Mao's teachings enlightened his heart, finding the root of the problem, which was in the word "official." He thought: I do not recognize my comrades, which shows that my contact is not broad; my comrades do not recognize me, which shows that I have the air of an official. He grabbed this "official" air and fought against the "private" self. In the Party small group meeting, he exposed the "private" self, and in the masses' speaking meeting, he fiercely fought against the "official" air. He also wrote Chairman Mao's teaching, "Be both an 'official' and a common person," in his study notes, using it as a motto, checking it every day. He was very grateful to this old worker for his help. He wrote in his study notes: "Without the masses' criticism, one cannot remove the dust in one's thoughts, and leaders can always maintain revolutionary youth in criticism."

The leaders are like this, and ordinary cadres are also like this. Once, the staff member Liu Guangsi was on a warship with the soldiers for daily reading, but he did not speak. Some soldiers said, "Comrade Liu, we also want to hear your experience of breaking private thoughts and establishing public thoughts." This remark touched Liu Guangsi, who thought that not speaking in the meeting was because he had the air of an official, and he was afraid of being embarrassed in front of the masses. He told the leadership about the masses' criticism and his understanding, and the leadership immediately launched a small rectification activity in the unit on whether they were close enough to the masses, making everyone further realize: Only by daring to expose and fight against private thoughts in front of the masses can one truly become one with the masses, and never separate from the masses for a moment. In this way, the staff members' hearts are closer to the soldiers, and the relationship is more intimate.

Chairman Mao teaches us, "Do not be afraid of criticism. The entire army will correctly understand the world and change the world in this process of criticism." This Party Committee remembers Chairman Mao's teachings, regarding the masses' criticism as the driving force for the revolutionization of the unit and work. Last winter, a soldier sent a note to the political department with Chairman Mao's teachings: "Revolutionary culture is a powerful weapon for the people." Below, it was written: "The unit should study the cultural life of the troops, and in addition to showing movies, it should develop slide shows to propagate Mao Zedong Thought." The leadership saw this criticism and opinion, immediately held a meeting, checked the weak links of the unit in emphasizing proletarian political work, and quickly sent cadres to the grassroots to study with the soldiers how to carry out cultural activities and slide show propaganda. Through discussions with the masses, specific measures were formulated. A mass activity of using slide shows to propagate studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought quickly began. This played a significant role in inspiring the fighting spirit and promoting the thought revolutionization of the unit.

Standing on the front line of the masses' struggle,
Leading the broad masses to forge ahead bravely.

This Party Committee, which always maintains and carries forward our Party's fine tradition of maintaining close ties with the masses, leads the masses to forge ahead on the road of revolutionization. The leaders always stand on the front line of struggle, where the tasks are the most arduous and the work is the most difficult, they go there. In the battle to defend the motherland, they lead the heroic soldiers to bravely fight the enemy. During sea patrols, they guard the battle positions with the soldiers, monitoring the enemy. During a long voyage, the leaders and staff members boarded the warship with the soldiers. Some faced the strong winds and waves, controlling the direction; some, in the strong winds and waves, held the loudspeaker, continuously shouting, "Resolutely determined, fearing no sacrifice, overcoming all difficulties, and striving for victory," inspiring the soldiers to overcome difficulties.

This Party Committee stands on the front line of the struggle for continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat, leading the broad cadres and soldiers to bravely fight against the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party led by China's Khrushchev. When the counter-revolutionary revisionist element Luo Ronghui advocates weaponry, they propagate that those armed with Mao Zedong Thought are the greatest fighting force; when the counter-revolutionary revisionist element Luo Ronghui stirs up the wind of large-scale competitions, they vigorously propagate studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, insisting on the Four Firsts, leading the broad cadres and soldiers to study the "Three Articles," break private thoughts, and establish public thoughts, changing their worldviews. During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, they closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, fully implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions. When revolutionary criticism was vigorously carried out nationwide, they immediately rushed to the front line, making the revolutionary criticism vigorous and resounding. When Chairman Mao issued the great call to establish study classes, they quickly responded, sending a large number of cadres to the troops for specific guidance, making Mao Zedong Thought study classes bloom everywhere, and further improving the cadres' and soldiers' awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines. The soldiers praised the leadership: You are a reliable command center on the ideological front line. You are not only our comrades-in-arms but also the vanguard of defending Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. They deeply felt: What is the greatest loyalty of the unit? Standing on the front line of class struggle, leading everyone to defend Chairman Mao, defend Mao Zedong Thought, and defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line is the greatest loyalty and the greatest public spirit. This is the touchstone for the unit never separating from the masses for a moment.

    一时一刻也不脱离群众
    ——记保持党的紧密联系群众优良作风的人民解放军海军某部领导机关
      “国家机关的改革，最根本的一条，就是联系群众。”人民解放军海军学习毛主席著作先进集体、英勇捍卫毛主席革命路线的一面红旗某部党委，及其领导的司令部、政治部、后勤部，遵照伟大领袖毛主席的教导，保持和发扬了党的紧密联系群众的优良作风，一时一刻也不脱离群众，成为带领群众奋勇前进的战斗指挥部。
        满腔热情地到群众中去，
        扎　根　于　群　众　之　中
    这里，地处南海前哨，人民解放军的英雄战士守卫在漫长的海岸线上，日日夜夜警惕地保卫着祖国南大门，保卫着无产阶级文化大革命，保卫着毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。这个部队的领导干部和机关干部，同这些无限忠于毛主席的战士，生活在一起，战斗在一起，心心相连，亲密无间。
    今年春节的早上，领导干部一起床就到部队去了，和战士们一起吃忆苦餐，批判中国赫鲁晓夫的滔天罪行。一位副部队长边吃边忆苦，当他回忆旧社会“地主喝尽佃户血，堆堆白骨抛荒丘”的悲惨生活时，许多战士的泪水，簌簌落在碗里的苦苦菜上。这位副部队长满腔愤怒地说：“这就是中国赫鲁晓夫所鼓吹的‘剥削有功’！”他坚定地表示，一定牢记毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的教导，永远不忘过去阶级压迫的苦，时刻想到今日的甜，把中国革命和世界革命进行到底。这时，一张张挂着泪水的脸，激动地仰望着伟大领袖毛主席像，千言万语汇成一句话，齐声敬祝毛主席万寿无疆！一碗碗苦苦菜，一桩桩旧社会的苦，把领导干部和战士们的心连结在一起，心贴心地站在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线上。
    晚上，政治委员从战艇上回来很久还睡不着。深夜十二点了，他还在想：战士们现在在做什么？在想什么？今天和战士们一起忆了苦，又有什么反应？他起了床，又到艇上去了。一盏亮着的小油灯把他吸引住了，走进一看，战士卞家艾正在全神贯注地学习《中国社会各阶级的分析》。卞家艾看见政委走过来，含着泪水，双手捧着毛主席著作，激动地说：“政委，我一定牢记毛主席的教导，念念不忘阶级斗争，念念不忘无产阶级专政。”
    伟大领袖毛主席教导说：“我们任何时候都不要离开群众。这样，我们就可能知道群众，了解群众，同群众一道，也就可能好好地为人民服务。”这里的领导干部、机关干部就是遵循毛主席的教导，时刻不忘群众，随时注意了解群众，时刻都在群众之中。
    在这里，一天工作开始的时候，领导干部和机关干部，有的在战艇上，有的在炊事班，有的在饲养场，有的在警卫排，同战士们一起活学活用毛主席著作，纵情歌唱《东方红》，敬祝伟大领袖毛主席万寿无疆。
    在这里，每次接到毛主席最新指示的时候，他们就是不吃饭、不睡觉，也要最迅速地把毛主席的最新指示传到战士们的心中。毛主席视察华北、中南和华东地区时所作的重要指示传来的那天，已经是晚上快熄灯的时候，他们立即向各单位传达，并连夜翻印，第二天一早就把毛主席的最新指示，送到战士和驻地附近公社社员的手里。
    毛主席的每一个战斗号令，在这里都是雷厉风行地贯彻执行。革命大批判的号角吹响了，领导干部和机关干部除值班的以外，都背着背包到基层单位，和战士们一起狠批中国赫鲁晓夫和反革命修正主义分子彭德怀、罗瑞卿的反革命修正主义路线。一天，一位党委委员在一号艇上同战士们一起批判中国赫鲁晓夫在一九五五年散布的“只有学好技术，才能保卫国防”的反动谬论，就接到二号艇战士们的请求，要他参加批判大阴谋家、大野心家罗瑞卿的反动的资产阶级军事路线。这个党委委员立即到了二号艇，和战士们一起把反革命修正主义分子罗瑞卿鼓吹的“技术第一”、“尖子第一”等反动谬论驳得体无完肤，使革命大批判步步深入。
    在这里，领导干部和机关干部时刻想着战士，急战士所急，帮战士所需。当战士们考虑怎样在阶级斗争大风大浪中活学活用毛泽东思想的时候，他们及时总结推广了参加“三支”“两军”工作的学习毛主席著作积极分子郭炎的先进经验。革命大批判需要深入发展的时候，他们及时介绍了二号艇每个星期选一个反革命修正主义谬论，发动群众用战无不胜的毛泽东思想反复进行批判的作法，使中国赫鲁晓夫等党内一小撮走资派的每一个反动观点都批得深、批得透、批得彻底。
    在这里，新干部一到，领导干部就带他们到基层，和他们一起学习“老三篇”和毛主席关于密切联系群众的教导，使他们和战士们打成一片。在这里，战士熟悉干部，干部了解战士，每逢节假日，战士三三两两的到机关找干部谈心，干部也不时到码头上与战士拉家常。整个领导机关就象一团旺盛的政治火焰，时刻在群众中燃烧。
        老老实实甘当群众的小学生
      “要做人民的先生，先做人民的学生。”这个部队的领导干部和机关干部遵照毛主席的教导，树立了对待群众的正确态度。他们并不满足于和群众同吃，同住，同学习，同讲用，同劳动，一同批判资产阶级，他们还拜群众为师，向群众学习。他们说：要真正做到一时一刻也不脱离群众，必须以革命的态度对待群众，甘当群众的小学生，老老实实地、诚心诚意地向群众学习。
    八月的一天，南方的骄阳晒得战艇的甲板滚烫。机关干事周卫东在一只战艇上蹲点。这天这只艇出海训练回来，要清洁硝烟熏黑的鱼雷发射管的内膛，周卫东没向鱼雷兵请教，就脱掉衣服，钻进鱼雷发射管干了起来。管内温度高，非常闷热，硝烟熏人，周卫东进去不久，皮肤就烫红了。鱼雷兵一个劲地打海水往发射管上浇，减低内部的温度。清洁完了，周卫东累得满身大汗，浑身是油泥，还清洁得不合格。晚上周卫东同鱼雷兵谈心，鱼雷兵希望周卫东学习“老三篇”。周卫东学习了“老三篇”，发现自己做这件事的动机不纯，认为自己是机关干部，要给战士做个样子，让战士们看一看，而忘记了自己首先是普通一兵。
    机关干部下到部队，是先做学生，还是先做先生，事实教育了周卫东。他在天天读时，向战士亮了这个私心，斗了这个“私”字。他说：“机关干部思想革命化，不是先化别人，而是先化自己，只有先当群众的学生，斗掉自己的个人主义，才能真正成为普通一兵。”鱼雷兵听了周卫东的自我批评，很受感动。他不但把清洁的方法教给了周卫东，还把自己从不愿当鱼雷兵，到热爱鱼雷兵，成了五好战士，活学活用毛泽东思想积极分子的体会讲给周卫东听。两人成了心贴心的“一对红”。
    这里的领导干部更是以小学生的姿态出现在群众中，从群众身上吸取营养。一天，部队长到一个中队去，听了一位轮机兵介绍在群众斗争中活学活用毛泽东思想的体会，他很受启发。当天晚上，他就到艇上拜这位轮机兵为师，促膝谈心，一字一句地看了这个战士的学习心得笔记。他从这位战士的事迹中更深刻地认识到毛主席关于到群众斗争中去经风雨见世面的教导的重大意义，感到自己对毛主席这一伟大指示的理解没有这位战士深刻、朴实。夜深了，这位跟随毛主席南征北战的老干部，还在灯光下，聚精会神地学习毛主席著作以及战士们的学习心得笔记，一字一句把战士的新思想、新语言抄写在自己的学习本上。为了真正把战士们忠于毛主席的思想感情学到手，他一连四次登门求教这位轮机兵，还不止一次地对这位战士说：“你不但教我如何在人民群众中加深无产阶级的感情，而且给部队革命化建设出了好点子，贡献了好经验。”
    这位领导干部从这个战士身上吸取了营养，受到了教育。他积极推广了这个战士的经验，而且以身作则，带领干部到群众斗争中经风雨见世面。在抗旱斗争时，他带领机关干部到了农村，和人民群众一起活学活用毛泽东思想。在两条路线斗争激烈的时候，他又带领干部、战士、职工、家属，背着行李，到工厂、农村进行政治野营，和工人、农民、学生一起劳动，一起活学活用毛泽东思想，一同批判资产阶级，促进部队思想革命化建设。从这以后，部队搞阶级教育，或者新干部提拔起来之前，都要到农村或国营农场进行政治野营或社会调查，同人民群众一起参加火热的阶级斗争。
    这样拜群众为师，甘当群众小学生的事，在这个领导机关里已形成良好的风气。他们从实践中深深体会到，老老实实甘当群众的小学生，这是一场深刻的思想革命，是每个干部一辈子的事。你今天是群众的小学生，你就有革命朝气，你明天不甘当小学生，思想感情就起变化，就会停滞起来，机关会滋长官僚主义、干部会变成“老爷”。他们说：越是自觉地甘当群众的小学生，学到的东西就越多，自己的本领就越大，对人民就越有贡献。越是老老实实甘当群众的小学生，和战士们心连心，心贴心，对毛主席的忠在灵魂深处扎根越牢、心染得就越红。
        虚心诚恳地听取群众的批评
    这个部队党委和领导机关，能做到一刻也不脱离群众，还在于他们善于听取群众的意见，勇于多做自我批评，谦虚谨慎，把听取群众的批评看成是对毛主席的最大的忠。
    一天，一位副政治委员到轮机修理所，找一位老工人谈心。老工人说：“我怎么不认识你，你是哪里来的？”这件事引起了这位领导干部的思想斗争。他想：我来到这个部队好几年了，为什么老职工还不认识我？他带着问题反复学习了毛主席的教导：“人们的工作有所不同，职务有所不同，但是任何人不论官有多大，在人民中间都要以一个普通劳动者的姿态出现。”毛主席的教导照亮了他的心，找到了问题的根子，这个根子就在“官”字上。他想：我不认识同志们，说明我接触的面不广；同志们不认识我，说明我有“官”气。他抓住这个“官”气猛斗“私”字。在党小组会上亮了“私”字，在群众讲用会上狠斗这个“官”气，他又把毛主席“既当‘官’，又当老百姓”的教导，写在自己心得笔记上，当做座右铭，天天对照检查。他十分感谢这位老工人对他的帮助。他在心得笔记上写道：“没有群众的批评，就不能去掉自己思想里的灰尘，领导干部在批评中可永葆革命的青春。”
    领导干部是这样，普通的干部也是这样。有一次，机关干事刘广思在一战艇上和战士们一块天天读，他没有发言。有的战士说：“刘干事，我们也想听听你破私立公的体会。”这句话触动了刘广思，他想，会上不发言是自己有“官”架子，在群众中亮私还怕丑。他把群众的批评和自己的认识告诉了领导，领导上立即在机关里开展了一个深入群众够不够的小整风活动，使大家进一步认识到：只有敢于在群众中亮私斗私，才能真正和群众打成一片，才能一时一刻也不脱离群众。这样，机关干部同战士们的心就贴得更紧了，关系更密切了。
    毛主席教导我们说：“不要怕批评，全军在这种批评过程中，将会正确地认识世界，并改造世界。”这个党委牢记毛主席的教导，把群众的批评当做机关革命化，工作革命化的动力。去年冬季的一天，有位战士给政治部送来了一张纸条，上面写着毛主席的教导：“革命文化，对于人民大众，是革命的有力武器。”下面写着：“机关对部队文化生活应该好好研究一下，除放电影外，应该发展幻灯，宣传毛泽东思想。”领导机关看到这个批评和意见，立即召开会议，检查了机关在突出无产阶级政治工作中的薄弱环节。并迅速派干部到基层去和战士们一起研究如何开展文化活动，开展幻灯宣传。通过和群众商量，制定了宣传的具体措施。一个群众性的用幻灯宣传活学活用毛泽东思想的好人好事活动很快地开展起来了。这对鼓舞斗志，促进部队思想革命化起了很大的推动作用。
      站在群众斗争第一线，
      带领广大群众奋勇前进
    这个始终保持和发扬我党的紧密联系群众优良传统的党委及其领导机关，带领群众在革命化道路上奋勇前进。领导干部始终站在斗争第一线，那里任务最艰巨，工作最艰苦，就到那里去。在保卫祖国的战斗中，他们带领英雄的战士奋勇杀敌。在海上巡逻时，他们同战士们一起守卫在战位上，监视敌人。在一次远航中，领导干部和机关干部与战士们一起登上战艇。他们有的迎着大风浪，掌握着航向；有的在大风大浪中，拿着广播筒，不断地高喊“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”，鼓舞战士们战胜困难。
    这个党委站在无产阶级专政下继续革命的斗争第一线，带领广大指战员向以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内一小撮走资派进行了英勇的斗争。反革命修正主义分子罗瑞卿鼓吹唯武器论，他们就宣传用毛泽东思想武装起来的人是最大的战斗力；反革命修正主义分子罗瑞卿掀起大比武妖风，他们就大力宣传活学活用毛主席著作，坚持四个第一，带领广大指战员学习“老三篇”，破私立公，改造世界观。在无产阶级文化大革命中，他们紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，全面落实毛主席的最新指示。革命大批判在全国蓬勃兴起的时候，他们立即奔赴第一线，把革命大批判开展得轰轰烈烈。毛主席发出大办学习班的伟大号召，他们闻风而动，派出大批干部下部队具体指导，使毛泽东思想学习班遍地开花，使广大指战员的阶级斗争观念和两条路线斗争觉悟进一步得到提高。战士们赞扬领导机关说：你们是过硬的思想战线指挥部，你们不仅是我们的战友，而且是捍卫毛主席革命路线的尖兵。他们深有体会地说：什么是机关最大的忠，站在阶级斗争第一线，带领大家一起保卫毛主席、保卫毛泽东思想、保卫毛主席革命路线，就是最大的忠，最大的公，这是领导机关一时一刻也不脱离群众的试金石。
