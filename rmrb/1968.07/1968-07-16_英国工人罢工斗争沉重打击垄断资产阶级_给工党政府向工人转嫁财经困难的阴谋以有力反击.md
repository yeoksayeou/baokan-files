Recently, the wave of strikes by the British working class has surged again, dealing a heavy blow to the monopolistic bourgeoisie and their agents, the Labour government.

Following the strike by British dockworkers last autumn, which caused significant losses to British monopoly capital, especially in export trade, in May this year, three million machine workers across the country went on strike. They protested against the capitalists' refusal to meet their reasonable demands for wage increases, leading to many factories in the automobile, machinery, metal, shipbuilding, aerospace, and electrical equipment industries halting or reducing production. In particular, the strike wave has intensified since June. From midnight on June 23 to July 6, approximately 300,000 British railway workers launched a massive work-to-rule campaign. They refused to work overtime or on weekends and holidays to protest against the British railway authorities' repeated refusal to meet their reasonable demands for wage increases. Instead, the authorities arbitrarily demanded increased labor intensity and reduced workforce as prerequisites for wage increases. This nationwide railway workers' work-to-rule campaign quickly paralyzed the country's railway transportation. During the work-to-rule period, not a single train arrived or departed on time at ten of Britain's railway stations, while hundreds of smaller stations were forced to close. From the evening of June 29 to the early morning of July 1, over 6,000 trains across the country were halted for 32 hours to protest the railway authorities' attempt to threaten the striking workers by withholding their wages.

At the same time as the British railway workers' work-to-rule campaign, 1,000 pilots of British Overseas Airways Corporation went on strike from June 16 to July 1, demanding wage increases. Additionally, 380 female workers at the Ford Motor Company's Dagenham and Halewood factories went on strike to demand equal pay for equal work. Furthermore, bus drivers in dozens of cities and towns across Britain have been continuing their wage increase demands since last October.

The British workers' relentless struggles are a strong response to the Labour government's intensified efforts to shift financial and economic difficulties onto the working class.

Since the devaluation of the pound last November, Britain's financial and economic situation has continued to deteriorate, with industrial production remaining stagnant. Particularly, Britain's foreign trade, which monopolistic capitalists view as the lifeline of the British economy, saw a trade deficit increase by 300 million pounds in the first half of this year compared to the second half of last year. This has rapidly expanded Britain's international payments deficit and further depleted its gold and foreign exchange reserves.

Facing the deepening financial and economic crisis, the British Labour government has continued to implement a reactionary policy of freezing wages despite the general surge in prices. At the same time, it has increased various taxes, with the new budget passed in April alone raising taxes by 923 million pounds, setting a new record for the highest tax increase in British government history. Concurrently, the Labour government has pushed more and more British workers into unemployment. According to statistics, the number of unemployed in Britain reached 517,000 in June, the highest figure for June since 1940. The British ruling class has also intensified the use of police, courts, and prisons to suppress workers fighting for their livelihoods. It is this cruel oppression and exploitation that has sparked increasingly strong resistance from the British working people, leading to continuous waves of strikes.

    英国工人罢工斗争沉重打击垄断资产阶级
    给工党政府向工人转嫁财经困难的阴谋以有力反击
    据新华社伦敦十四日电　最近一个时期，英国工人阶级罢工斗争的浪潮又出现新的高涨，给垄断资产阶级及其代理人工党政府以沉重的打击。
    继去年秋季英国码头工人举行罢工使英国垄断资本特别在出口贸易方面遭到重大损失后，今年五月，英国全国各地的三百万机械工人又举行罢工，抗议资本家拒绝他们提出的增加工资的合理要求，使得英国汽车工业、机器制造业、五金工业、造船业、飞机工业和电工器材制造业的许多工厂停工减产。特别是六月份以来，罢工浪潮进一步高涨。从六月二十三日午夜到七月六日，英国约三十万铁路员工掀起了声势浩大的怠工运动，拒绝加班加点，拒绝在星期日和假日工作，以抗议英国铁路当局不但年复一年地拒不答应他们关于增加工资的合理要求，甚至还横蛮无理地提出以增加劳动强度和减少劳动力作为增加工资的先决条件。这次全国性的铁路员工大怠工开始后，英国全国铁路交通运输很快就陷于瘫痪。在怠工期间，英国的十个火车站，没有一次列车是正点到达或开出的，而数以百计的小车站则被迫关闭。六月二十九日晚到七月一日清晨，全国六千多列火车还停驶三十二小时，抗议铁路当局妄图以不发给工资来威胁怠工的铁路员工。
    在英国铁路员工怠工的同时，英国海外航空公司一千名飞机驾驶员也从六月十六日到七月一日举行了罢工，要求增加工资；美资福特汽车公司戴根纳姆工厂和哈勒伍德工厂的三百八十多名女工为争取男女同工同酬也进行了罢工。此外，英国全国各地几十个大小城市的公共汽车司机，也还在坚持他们从去年十月就开始的要求增加工资的斗争。
    英国工人再接再厉地奋起斗争，是对深陷在政治、经济危机中的工党政府变本加厉向工人阶级转嫁财政经济困难的反击。
    去年十一月英镑贬值后，英国的财政经济状况持续恶化，工业生产的总趋势仍然是停滞不前。特别是被英国垄断资本家视为英国经济生命线的对外贸易，今年上半年的逆差比去年下半年又增加了三百万镑。使得英国国际收支赤字迅速扩大，并导致黄金外汇储备的进一步枯竭。
    面对着日益加深的财政经济危机，英国工党政府一方面在物价普遍猛涨的情况下继续执行冻结工资的反动政策，一方面大肆增加苛捐杂税，今年四月通过的新预算，就规定增加税收九亿二千三百万英镑，创造了英国政府增税幅度的最高纪录。与此同时，工党政府还把越来越多的英国工人推入失业大军，据统计，今年六月，英国失业人数已达五十一万七千人，是一九四○年以来六月份的最高数字。英国统治集团还加紧利用警察、法庭、监狱等来镇压为维护生活权利而斗争的工人。正是这种残酷的迫害和剥削，激起了英国劳动人民越来越强烈的反抗，不断掀起罢工的浪潮。
