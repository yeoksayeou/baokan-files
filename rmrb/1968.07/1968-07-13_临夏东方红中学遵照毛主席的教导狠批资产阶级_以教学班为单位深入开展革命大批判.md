Dongfanghong Middle School in Linxia, Gansu Province, follows Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, organizing revolutionary teachers and students to conduct in-depth and sustained revolutionary criticism in classes. The class struggle and two-line struggle consciousness of revolutionary teachers and students have significantly improved, and the situation of resuming classes and making revolution is getting better and better.

Dongfanghong Middle School has over 300 teachers and students. Currently, from classrooms, dormitories, and the schoolyard to fields and construction sites where they participate in labor, everywhere is a battlefield for revolutionary criticism. Revolutionary teachers and students, with boundless love for the great leader Chairman Mao and intense hatred for the Chinese Khrushchev, resolutely follow Chairman Mao's instructions that students should also criticize the bourgeoisie. They criticize and condemn the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in the education department, launching wave after wave of fierce attacks. They deeply criticize and condemn the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line. Through conducting revolutionary criticism, the ideological revolutionization of revolutionary teachers and students has been effectively promoted, and their consciousness of class struggle and two-line struggle has significantly improved. New phenomena such as teachers and students preparing lessons together and teaching together are emerging, and the situation of resuming classes and making revolution is getting better and better.

After several months of practice, revolutionary teachers and students at Dongfanghong Middle School have deeply realized that conducting revolutionary criticism in classes is an effective method to ensure the in-depth development of school revolutionary criticism and an effective measure to carry out educational revolution. Their specific practices and experiences are as follows:

1. Conducting revolutionary criticism in classes can fully mobilize the masses, stimulate everyone's enthusiasm, and let everyone criticize and condemn, fully utilizing the great power of "people's war." Revolutionary teachers and students say: In the past, revolutionary criticism was conducted mainly through large meetings, with a few people speaking on stage while most people listened, and everyone had energy but couldn't use it. Now, conducting revolutionary criticism in classes is more flexible and mobile, with sufficient time and practical relevance. Everyone joins in, criticizing and condemning the counter-revolutionary revisionist garbage promoted by the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents, leaving them with no room to hide. Revolutionary teachers and students study and apply Mao Zedong Thought, deeply criticizing and condemning the counter-revolutionary revisionist garbage promoted by the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents, such as "intellectual education first," "grades as the criterion," and "college entrance first."

2. Combining revolutionary criticism with classroom teaching, using Mao Zedong Thought to guide every class, turning every class into a criticism meeting and a sharing meeting, teaching and learning through criticism. For example, in language teaching, they use Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to conduct in-depth and systematic criticism of the old language teaching syllabus, teaching materials, and teaching methods. In conducting revolutionary criticism, revolutionary teachers and students study and apply Mao Zedong Thought, closely linking it with the reality of class struggle, using powerful facts and sharp writing to produce many criticism articles of a certain level.

3. Combining revolutionary criticism with the actual class struggle in the region and unit. Another practice of Dongfanghong Middle School in conducting revolutionary criticism in classes is to organize revolutionary teachers and students to go to factories, rural areas, and military units in classes, eating, living, working, studying, and fighting together with workers, peasants, and soldiers. Revolutionary teachers and students who went to Zheqiao Commune in Linxia City to participate in labor held three criticism meetings and six bitter-sweet reminiscence meetings with poor and lower-middle peasants. Poor and lower-middle peasants used vivid class struggle realities to deeply criticize the counter-revolutionary revisionist garbage promoted by the Chinese Khrushchev, such as the theory of "class struggle extinction," "three autonomies and one contract," "four freedoms," "exploitation is meritorious," and "peach garden experience." They denounced the crimes of the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in promoting the revisionist educational line and suppressing and attacking the children of poor and lower-middle peasants from enrolling and advancing in school, giving revolutionary teachers and students a vivid class education.

    临夏东方红中学遵照毛主席的教导狠批资产阶级
    以教学班为单位深入开展革命大批判
    据新华社兰州电　甘肃省临夏市东方红中学革命委员会，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，组织广大革命师生以教学班为单位，深入持久地开展革命大批判，革命师生的阶级斗争和两条路线斗争的觉悟大大提高，复课闹革命的形势越来越好。
    东方红中学共有师生三百多人。目前，全校从教室、宿舍、校园到参加劳动的田间、工地，到处都是革命大批判的战场。广大革命师生怀着对伟大领袖毛主席的无限热爱，对中国赫鲁晓夫的无比仇恨，坚决遵照毛主席关于学生也要批判资产阶级的教导，人人口诛笔伐，向中国赫鲁晓夫及其在教育部门的代理人发起一次又一次的猛烈进攻，深揭狠批反革命修正主义教育路线。通过开展革命大批判，有力地促进了全校革命师生的思想革命化，阶级斗争和两条路线斗争的觉悟大大提高。师生共同备课，同上讲台等新气象不断出现，复课闹革命的形势越来越好。
    经过几个月的实践，东方红中学革命师生深刻体会到：以教学班为单位开展革命大批判，是保证学校革命大批判深入开展下去的有效方法，是搞好教育革命的有效措施。他们的具体做法和体会是：
    一，以教学班为单位开展革命大批判，能够充分发动群众，调动大家的积极性，人人口诛笔伐，充分发挥“人民战争”的巨大威力。革命师生说：过去开展革命大批判，光是开大会，少数人在台上发言，多数人在台下听，大家有劲使不上；现在以教学班为单位开展革命大批判，人数较少，机动灵活，时间充足，结合实际，大家一齐上阵，把中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人推行的反革命修正主义黑货批得体无完肤。革命师生活学活用毛泽东思想，深揭狠批中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人宣扬的“智育第一”、“分数挂帅”、“升学第一”等反革命修正主义黑货。
    二，把革命大批判同课堂教学结合起来，用毛泽东思想统帅每一节课，把每一节课变成批判会、讲用会，在批判中教，在批判中学。例如在语文教学中，他们用毛泽东思想作武器，对旧的语文教学大纲、教材内容、教学方法进行深入系统的批判。在开展革命大批判中，革命师生活学活用毛泽东思想，紧密联系阶级斗争实际，以有力的事实，犀利的笔锋，写出了许多具有一定水平的批判文章。
    三，把革命大批判同本地区、本单位阶级斗争实际结合起来。东方红中学以教学班为单位开展革命大批判的又一个做法是，组织全校革命师生以班级为单位，分别深入到工厂、农村和连队，同工农兵群众同吃、同住、同劳动、同学习、同战斗。到临夏市折桥公社参加劳动的革命师生，和贫下中农一起召开了三次批判会，六次忆苦思甜会。贫下中农用活生生的阶级斗争实际，深刻地批判了中国赫鲁晓夫鼓吹的“阶级斗争熄灭”论、“三自一包”、“四大自由”、“剥削有功”、“桃园经验”等反革命修正主义黑货，控诉了中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人推行修正主义教育路线，排挤打击贫下中农子女入学升学的罪行，使革命师生受到了生动的阶级教育。
