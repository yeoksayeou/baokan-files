**Sunlight and Dew Nurture New Blossoms**

**— Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers, Revolutionary Artists Warmly Praise the Piano Accompaniment of "The Red Lantern"**

**A Bloom Radiating the Splendor of Mao Zedong Thought**

**Guo Fuyou (Political Commissar of a Squadron in the East China Sea Fleet):**

**Li Heqiu (Deputy Platoon Leader of a Naval Unit):**

July 1, 1968, is the most unforgettable and happiest day of our lives. That evening, we saw Chairman Mao, whom we have longed for day and night, and together with our great leader Chairman Mao, we enjoyed the new form of proletarian revolutionary art, the piano accompaniment of "The Red Lantern." Therefore, our excited hearts could not calm down for a long time. Our eyes were filled with tears of happiness and excitement, and we shouted a thousand and ten thousand times: Long live Chairman Mao! Long live Chairman Mao's revolutionary line on literature and art!

More than twenty years ago, Chairman Mao taught us: "Our literature and art are for the people. They are first for the workers, peasants, and soldiers, created for the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and used by the workers, peasants, and soldiers." Regarding ancient and foreign arts, we should "make the past serve the present and foreign things serve China." However, for a long time, the counter-revolutionary revisionist clique led by Zhou Yang refused to carry out Chairman Mao's instructions, making piano art serve a few bourgeois masters and misses. Those bourgeois artists deliberately made piano art seem mysterious, saying that the piano is a high-level art that can only perform so-called world-famous pieces from the 18th and 19th centuries. What high-level art, what world-famous pieces? In essence, they are just some soft, ethereal, and sickly capitalist and revisionist trash. Such "high-level art" can only sap the fighting spirit of revolutionary people. We workers, peasants, and soldiers do not like it and do not want to listen to it.

The piano accompaniment of "The Red Lantern" portrays the heroic image of workers, peasants, and soldiers and sings of the heroic deeds created by workers, peasants, and soldiers. In terms of art, it retains the basic characteristics of Beijing opera singing while fully utilizing the unique features of piano art. When we see that the person standing in front of the piano is no longer those coquettish bourgeois misses and masters but the towering heroic figures of workers, peasants, and soldiers; when we hear the powerful piano music accompanying the arias of Beijing opera performers, we feel very excited. The piano and the arias take us back to the days of the War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression. We seem to see the cruel and tyrannical Japanese imperialists and the brave Chinese people who dare to fight against tyranny. This increases our class hatred and national enmity and deepens our love for the new society and our great leader Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao said: "Literature and art should become a powerful weapon to unite the people, educate the people, attack the enemy, and destroy the enemy." The piano accompaniment of "The Red Lantern" is indeed a powerful weapon to "unite the people, educate the people, attack the enemy, and destroy the enemy." It well implements Chairman Mao's policy that literature and art should serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers and serve proletarian politics.

The piano accompaniment of "The Red Lantern," this new bloom in the garden of proletarian literature and art, has grown under the sunlight and dew of Mao Zedong Thought. We love what Chairman Mao loves and support what Chairman Mao supports. We will loudly cheer for the piano accompaniment of "The Red Lantern." Under the splendor of Mao Zedong Thought, we firmly believe that more blooms of proletarian literature and art will flourish!

**Wang Wenyue (Worker of Factory 541):**

We workers listened to the piano accompaniment of "The Red Lantern" and were deeply moved. It expresses the feelings of the working class and is a moving song of praise for Mao Zedong Thought, a great flower of proletarian literature and art.

The piano accompaniment of "The Red Lantern" vividly portrays the heroic characters of Li Yuhe and Li Tiemei; successfully creates the brilliant image of proletarian heroes; perfectly depicts Li Yuhe's heroic spirit of overcoming all enemies in any difficult situation; and delicately shows Li Tiemei's growth process of inheriting the family's red lantern and continuing the struggle under the education of Grandma Li and Li Yuhe. The piano accompaniment of "The Red Lantern" is indeed more expressive than the erhu accompaniment.

What has the piano played in the past? It was all about expressing the thoughts and feelings of foreign masters and misses, not about workers, peasants, and soldiers. We hated it! We workers, peasants, and soldiers love to see the brilliant images of workers, peasants, and soldiers and love to hear music that expresses our feelings. In the past, we also hoped that the piano could serve workers, peasants, and soldiers, but under the rule of the bourgeois literary and artistic line promoted by the Chinese Khrushchev, our wishes could not be realized. Today, under the splendor of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line on literature and art and the leadership and cultivation of Comrade Jiang Qing, a new form of proletarian literature and art has been created, opening up new paths for symphony, Western instruments, and drama accompaniment. The eight model operas have opened a new chapter in the history of human literature and art, and the piano accompaniment of "The Red Lantern" has added another bloom to the garden of proletarian revolutionary literature and art. We warmly welcome the birth of the piano accompaniment of "The Red Lantern" and celebrate the great victory of Mao Zedong Thought.

**Yang Bofang (Four Seasons Green People's Commune):**

Good news follows good news, and joyous tidings follow joyous tidings. On the 47th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China, the cultural front in the capital has brought us more good news: the new form of proletarian revolutionary literature and art, the piano accompaniment of "The Red Lantern," has been born. In the past few days, we have listened to the piano accompaniment of "The Red Lantern" on the radio several times, and the commune has organized us poor and lower-middle peasants to listen collectively. We like it more and more, and it gives us more and more energy.

We are not familiar with the piano. In the past, we heard it a few times on the radio, but it was all strange and foreign, and we couldn't understand it. People said the piano is a foreign thing and the "king of music," playing about foreign talents and beauties, life and death, love and other such things. The listeners were naturally those bourgeois lords and ladies, masters and misses. We poor peasants couldn't understand it and didn't like it.

The piano accompaniment of "The Red Lantern" is completely different. Deep in our hearts, we understand it and like it. Listening to it, it's as if we see the unyielding Li Yuhe facing off against Yama, and as if we see Little Iron Girl inheriting the revolutionary red lantern, determined to carry on her father's revolutionary cause and march forward. When we hear that majestic and tragic melody, we think of national hatred and class enmity; when we hear that passionate and heroic melody, we remember those revolutionaries who sacrificed their lives for the revolutionary cause, and this continually inspires us and adds strength to our bodies.

Today, this foreign thing, the piano, can serve us workers, peasants, and soldiers and contribute to socialist construction. This is another great victory of Chairman Mao's literary and artistic thought of "making the past serve the present and foreign things serve China," and the result of Comrade Jiang Qing's hard work in breaking through foreign frameworks and old conventions, and cultivating it with care. We poor peasants cheer a thousand times and applaud a million times. No matter how good it is, it all comes down to Chairman Mao being good, Mao Zedong Thought being good, Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line being good! Long live the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

**Opening Up a New Path for Making the Past Serve the Present and Foreign Things Serve China**

**Yang Huanzhang, Zhang Liying, Hua Jing (Beijing Knitting General Factory):**

At this moment of welcoming the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the cultural front in the capital has brought us good news: the piano accompaniment of "The Red Lantern" has been successfully created. This is a bloom of proletarian revolutionary literature and art created by our country's revolutionary literary and artistic workers following the great leader Chairman Mao's teaching of "making the past serve the present and foreign things serve China" and personally cultivated by Comrade Jiang Qing.

In the past, the Western instrument, the piano, was always in the hands of bourgeois "experts." They monopolized the stage, indulging in the sentimental feelings of foreign talents and beauties from the 18th and 19th centuries, summoning the spirits of capitalism. At that time, we workers did not appreciate this so-called "high-level" art of the bourgeoisie. The more those bourgeois spiritual aristocrats played the piano on the stage, shaking their heads and swaying their bodies, the less we workers paid attention to them.

However, this time, after listening to the piano accompaniment of "The Red Lantern," we began to feel very close to this foreign thing, the piano. The piano accompaniment of "The Red Lantern" fully expresses the fighting life of the Chinese people under the leadership of our great leader Chairman Mao and the Communist Party of China. From now on, this Western instrument, the piano, begins to express the modern fighting life of our country and sings for the heroic figures of socialism. The piano has a wide range and strong expressiveness, and it can better describe the rich emotions of characters. Using the piano to accompany the Beijing opera "The Red Lantern" makes the spiritual world of the heroes in this opera richer and their images more towering. The piano's sound is majestic and magnificent. After listening to the piano accompaniment of Li Yuhe's "Struggle on the Execution Ground," we feel that Li Yuhe has the momentum of Mount Tai pressing down on the enemy, and the image of a hero who is both wise and brave becomes more perfect, more vivid, and more towering in front of us.

The piano accompaniment of "The Red Lantern" is the first time a Western instrument has been used to serve workers, peasants, and soldiers and serve proletarian politics. This is a delightful harvest. We workers should also learn from the revolutionary spirit of daring to break old frameworks of revolutionary literary and artistic workers armed with Mao Zedong Thought, further "grasp the revolution and promote production," and achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

**Tang He, Sheng Mao (Warrior Cultural Troupe):**

The piano accompaniment of "The Red Lantern" is a new form of proletarian revolutionary literature and art and a bloom radiating the splendor of Mao Zedong Thought personally cultivated by Comrade Jiang Qing. We warmly celebrate another victory of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line on literature and art and warmly congratulate the Central Orchestra and the China Beijing Opera Troupe on the success of creating and performing the piano accompaniment of "The Red Lantern"!

For many years, the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in the literary and artistic circles, in order to restore capitalism, vigorously promoted the revisionist literary and artistic black line, madly resisting Chairman Mao's revolutionary line on literature and art, and refusing to carry out Comrade Jiang Qing's important instruction as early as 1964 that the piano should accompany modern Beijing opera. They praised those so-called world-famous masterpieces that sang the praises of the bourgeoisie and foreign talents and beauties, or some small pieces that dissipated fighting spirit and poisoned the working people, using the piano as a sinister tool to restore capitalism. The broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers were very disgusted with such piano performances.

In the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers and revolutionary literary and artistic workers, under the leadership of Comrade Jiang Qing, took up the thousand-catty hammer of Mao Zedong Thought, smashed the revisionist literary and artistic black line, and workers, peasants, and soldiers occupied the stage of literature and art. After capturing one after another stronghold of Beijing opera, ballet, and symphony, today we have successfully captured the piano battlefield and created the piano accompaniment of "The Red Lantern." This makes the Western instrument, the piano, which has long served the bourgeois lords, ladies, masters, and misses, begin to serve workers, peasants, and soldiers. Because the piano accompaniment of "The Red Lantern" fully utilizes the piano's wide range, magnificent momentum, and rich expressiveness, it better creates the towering images of Li Yuhe, Li Tiemei, and other heroes. The broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers are greatly inspired and deeply educated after listening to it.

The piano accompaniment of "The Red Lantern" is a bountiful result of implementing Chairman Mao's brilliant thought of "making the past serve the present and foreign things serve China." The piano accompaniment of "The Red Lantern" has perfectly combined Western piano art and Chinese Beijing opera art. It retains the basic characteristics and unique national forms and styles of Beijing opera singing while fully utilizing the unique expressiveness of the piano. In the piano accompaniment of "The Red Lantern," such as the segment "Everyone Has a Bright Red Heart," the piano accompaniment is bright, cheerful, and full of vitality, which vividly, truly, and perfectly portrays Li Tiemei's innocent, enthusiastic, and slightly childish character. Again, in "To Be a Person Like This," it is a more lyrical singing segment. When the performer sings "Uncle Gan is willing to shed blood and sacrifice. What are they fighting for?" these two sentences, using a soft singing method, the piano accompaniment here uses only a few very refined notes, but it is particularly captivating, perfectly portraying the performer's extremely deep and delicate emotions. In the interlude before singing "To save China, to save the poor, to defeat the Japanese soldiers," the piano plays passionately and heroically, leading to Iron Girl's magnificent singing. When singing "Father carries a burden of a thousand jin," the piano uses strong and powerful chords, emphasizing the word "heavy," perfectly expressing Iron Girl's determination to fear no tyranny and bravely shoulder the burden. From the above few examples, it can be said that due to the full play of the piano accompaniment's strengths, this greatly enriches the Beijing opera music, achieving the effect of combining East and West, taking the best of both, and opening up a new path for Western instruments and symphony, and a new path for our country's opera accompaniment. We firmly believe that the success of creating and performing the piano accompaniment of "The Red Lantern" will not only promote the vigorous development of our country's opera art but will also make the various new flowers of workers, peasants, and soldiers' literature and art created and developed in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution bloom even more brilliantly under the sunlight of Mao Zedong Thought!

Because our study is not enough, the above is just a thought during the study process. Regarding Comrade Jiang Qing's creation of this new model for us, we, the revolutionary music workers of the unit, must study it seriously. In the future, we must better go deep among the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, strive to reform our worldview, and better serve workers, peasants, and soldiers.

**Displaying Great Revolutionary Pioneering Spirit**

**Zhang Zhixing (Captain of the "Sea Hero" Boat where Mai Xiande is located):**

In the past, it was said that the piano is a "high-level" instrument that can only play classical masterpieces from the 18th and 19th centuries of the bourgeoisie, and playing ordinary songs would lower its status; it can only be enjoyed by those fat and prosperous lords and ladies, masters and misses. For hundreds of years, the piano has been labeled as "high-level," placed in the parlors of those aristocratic lords, and become their "exclusive item."

Should piano art be revolutionized? Can it be revolutionized? In the past, the counter-revolutionary revisionist clique in the literary and artistic circles led by Zhou Yang and their backer, the Chinese Khrushchev, did not allow it to be touched. They, like fake foreign devils, waved their "civilization sticks," not allowing revolution and suppressing revolution. As early as 1964, Comrade Jiang Qing, based on Chairman Mao's brilliant thought of "making the past serve the present and foreign things serve China," instructed that the piano should accompany revolutionary modern Beijing opera. However, that small clique of counter-revolutionary revisionists blocked it and refused to carry out the important instruction, delaying its meeting with revolutionary literary and artistic workers.

The magnificent Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution thoroughly smashed the sinister plots of that small clique of class enemies. Under the encouragement of the great situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, revolutionary literary and artistic workers rose up to rebel against them, seized their "civilization sticks," and displayed great revolutionary pioneering spirit, breaking superstitions, daring to think, dare to do, dare to revolutionize, daring to walk their own path, and daring to walk paths that others have not walked. Is the piano an untouchable "king of music"? Revolutionary literary and artistic workers, with a heroic spirit, dare to charge; can the piano not accompany modern revolutionary Beijing opera? Revolutionary literary and artistic workers, with unyielding revolutionary will, dare to break through; can the piano not serve workers, peasants, and soldiers? Revolutionary literary and artistic workers, with unshakable determination, dare to establish. Under the intimate care and enthusiastic guidance of Comrade Jiang Qing, they, through repeated practice, finally successfully created the piano accompaniment of "The Red Lantern." From then on, the piano moved from the parlors of aristocratic lords to the stages of workers, peasants, and soldiers; powerful revolutionary strong tones replaced the soft and weak sounds; the decayed and rotten piano art became a revolutionary art loved by the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers.

From the eight revolutionary model operas to the birth of the piano accompaniment of "The Red Lantern," they all prove a truth: with Mao Zedong Thought, any miracle in the world can be created. Why in the "August 6th" naval battle could our small cannon boat sink an enemy ship many times larger than ours? It was because of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. Why could Comrade Mai Xiande, after being seriously injured, still defend his combat post? It was because of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. With Mao Zedong Thought, we can overcome all enemies, but enemies cannot overcome us.

In the future, we must strive to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, arm our minds with Mao Zedong Thought; further carry forward the spirit of the "August 6th" naval battle, and as long as the enemy dares to invade, we will make it perish in the sea, coming in and never returning!

**Niu Shuting (Director of a certain observation and communication station in the North Sea Fleet):**

The success of the piano accompaniment of "The Red Lantern" greatly boosts our morale as workers, peasants, and soldiers and greatly dampens the arrogance of the bourgeoisie. This is the bountiful result of Comrade Jiang Qing leading revolutionary literary and artistic workers, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, breaking superstitions, daring to think, dare to do, and dare to revolutionize.

The great revolutionary pioneering spirit of revolutionary literary and artistic workers has given us great encouragement. The Chinese people armed with Mao Zedong Thought must walk their own path and do what others have not done. Our observation and communication station is at the forefront of the country's east, and we vigilantly guard the coastal defense line day and night. In recent years, under the splendor of Mao Zedong Thought, we have carried forward the revolutionary spirit of daring to think and do, fiercely breaking through the Soviet revisionist frameworks, and determined to walk our own path. When we encounter difficulties, some comrades say: Forget it, can we do it? What do we need experts for? However, Mao Zedong Thought has given us great strength. When facing difficulties, we follow Chairman Mao's teachings, strategically despise them, tactically take them seriously, fully rely on the masses, and finally greatly surpassed the Soviet revisionists in observation and calculation, and in the struggle to defend the country's coastal defense, we have many times excellently completed the tasks. The unit leaders praised us, saying: Radar soldiers armed with Mao Zedong Thought stand high, see far, grasp accurately, and have the brightest eyes.

Seeing the new form of proletarian revolutionary literature and art created by revolutionary literary and artistic workers—the piano accompaniment of "The Red Lantern"—we are greatly inspired. We will take Comrade Jiang Qing as our example, hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, dare to think, dare to do, dare to revolutionize, dare to do what others have not done, and be good thousand-mile eyes for defending the country and defending Chairman Mao.

    阳光雨露育新花
    ——工农兵、革命文艺战士热烈赞扬钢琴伴唱《红灯记》
    闪耀着毛泽东思想光辉的一朵鲜花
    郭福友（东海舰队某飞行大队政委）：
    李合奎（海军某部副连长）：
    一九六八年七月一日，是我们一生当中最最难忘、最最幸福的日子。这天晚上，我们见到了日夜想念的毛主席，并且和伟大领袖毛主席一起，欣赏了无产阶级革命文艺的新品种钢琴伴唱《红灯记》，因此我们激动的心久久不能平静。我们眼里含着幸福和兴奋的热泪，千遍万遍欢呼：毛主席万岁！毛主席的革命文艺路线万岁！
    早在二十多年前，毛主席就教导我们：“我们的文学艺术都是为人民大众的，首先是为工农兵的，为工农兵而创作，为工农兵所利用的。”对古代和外国的文艺，要“古为今用，洋为中用”。可是，长时期以来，反革命修正主义分子周扬一伙却拒不执行毛主席的指示，使钢琴艺术为少数资产阶级老爷、小姐服务。那些资产阶级的艺术家，有意把钢琴艺术说的玄而又玄，说什么钢琴是门高级艺术，只能演奏所谓十八、十九世纪的世界名曲。什么高级艺术，什么世界名曲，说穿了，无非是些软绵绵的、虚无缥缈的、无病呻吟的资本主义和修正主义的破烂货。这样的“高级艺术”，对革命人民只能起瓦解斗志的作用，我们工农兵就是不爱听，就是不要听。
    钢琴伴唱《红灯记》，塑造的是工农兵的英雄形象，唱的是工农兵创造的英雄业绩。艺术上，它既保留了京剧唱腔的基本特点，又充分发挥了钢琴艺术的特色。当我们看到站在钢琴跟前的不再是那些忸怩作态的资产阶级小姐、少爷，而是高大的工农兵英雄形象；当我们耳边响起铿锵有力的琴声伴和着京剧演员的清唱的时候，我们感到十分激动。琴声和清唱把我们带回到抗日战争时期的境地。我们又仿佛看到了凶残暴虐的日本帝国主义者，看到了不畏强暴、敢于斗争的英勇的中国人民，因而更增加了阶级仇、民族恨，更增加对新社会，对我们伟大领袖毛主席的热爱。毛主席说：要使文艺成为“团结人民、教育人民、打击敌人、消灭敌人的有力的武器”。钢琴伴唱《红灯记》就是“团结人民、教育人民、打击敌人、消灭敌人”的有力武器，它很好地贯彻了毛主席指出的文艺为工农兵，文艺为无产阶级政治服务这个方针。
    钢琴伴唱《红灯记》这朵无产阶级文艺园地新开的鲜花，是在毛泽东思想的阳光雨露下成长起来的。毛主席热爱我热爱，毛主席支持我支持，我们就是要高声为钢琴伴唱《红灯记》叫好。在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，我们坚信将有更多的无产阶级文艺鲜花盛开！
    王文月（五四一厂工人）：
    我们工人听了钢琴伴唱《红灯记》，心里都非常激动。它抒发了我们工人阶级的感情，它是一曲动人心弦的毛泽东思想的颂歌，是无产阶级文艺的大香花。
    钢琴伴唱《红灯记》，突出地刻划了李玉和与李铁梅的英雄性格；成功地塑造了无产阶级英雄的光辉形象；完美地烘托出李玉和在任何艰难困苦的场合都要压倒一切敌人而决不被敌人所屈服的英雄气概；细致地表现了李铁梅在李奶奶和李玉和的教育下，接过家传的红灯，踏着先烈的血迹继续战斗的成长过程。钢琴伴唱《红灯记》的确比京胡伴唱更富有表现力。
    过去钢琴弹的是些什么玩意儿？尽是表现洋少爷、洋小姐的思想感情，根本不表现工农兵。我们对它讨厌透了！我们工农兵就是爱看工农兵的光辉形象，爱听抒发我们工农兵感情的音乐。过去，我们也希望钢琴为工农兵服务，但在中国赫鲁晓夫所推行的资产阶级文艺黑线统治下，我们的愿望不可能实现。今天，在毛主席革命文艺路线的光辉照耀下，在江青同志的领导和培育下，创造出无产阶级文艺的新品种，为交响乐、西洋乐器和戏剧伴奏开辟了新的道路。八个样板戏揭开了人类文艺史上的新篇章，钢琴伴唱《红灯记》又为无产阶级革命文艺园地增添了一朵鲜花。我们热烈欢呼钢琴伴唱《红灯记》的诞生，欢呼毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。
    杨伯芳（四季青人民公社）：
    捷报连捷报，喜讯接喜讯。在中国共产党诞生四十七周年的大喜日子里，首都文艺战线又传来喜讯：无产阶级革命文艺的新品种钢琴伴唱《红灯记》诞生了。这几天，咱们从广播里听了好几遍钢琴伴唱《红灯记》，公社还组织咱们贫下中农集体收听，咱们是越听越喜欢，越听越有劲。
    钢琴这玩意儿，咱可不熟悉。以前在广播里倒也听过几次，都是怪里怪气，洋腔洋调，根本听不懂。听人说钢琴是个洋玩意儿，还是什么“音乐之王”，尽弹什么洋才子佳人，生啦，死啦，爱啦这些事儿，听的人当然也是那些资产阶级的老爷太太，少爷小姐。咱贫下中农听不懂，也不爱听。
    钢琴伴唱《红灯记》可大不相同，打心眼里说，咱们听得懂，爱听。听着听着，就好象看到英勇不屈的李玉和在和鸠山作面对面的斗争，就好象看到小铁梅接过革命红灯，决心继承父亲的革命遗志继续前进。咱们听到那雄浑悲壮的曲子，就想起了民族恨，阶级仇；听到那激昂慷慨的曲子，就记起那些抛头颅，洒热血，为了革命事业不惜牺牲生命的革命先烈，从而不断激励自己，浑身增添干劲。
    钢琴这洋玩意儿，今天居然能为咱们工农兵服务，为社会主义建设出力，这是毛主席“古为今用，洋为中用”的文艺思想又一伟大胜利，是江青同志披荆斩棘，打破洋框框、踢开旧教条，精心培育的结果。我们贫下中农为这样的好音乐千遍叫好，万遍喝采。千好万好，归根到底，就是毛主席好，毛泽东思想好，毛主席无产阶级革命路线好！无产阶级文化大革命好！开辟了古为今用，洋为
    中用的崭新道路
    杨焕章、张立影、华静（北京针织总厂）：
    在迎接无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的时刻，首都文艺战线上传来了喜讯：钢琴伴唱《红灯记》创作成功了。这是我国革命文艺工作者遵循伟大领袖毛主席“古为今用，洋为中用”的教导，由江青同志亲自培育出来的无产阶级革命文艺的鲜花。
    钢琴这种西洋乐器，过去一直把持在资产阶级的“专家”手里。他们窃踞琴台，大发怀恋十八、十九世纪洋人、死人的幽情，为资本主义招魂。那时，咱们工人根本不欣赏这种资产阶级所谓“高级”的艺术。那些资产阶级精神贵族老爷们在琴台上越是弹得摇头晃脑，我们工人也就越不理他们的茬。
    但是，这次我们听了钢琴伴唱《红灯记》后，对钢琴这个洋玩意儿，开始感到非常亲切。钢琴伴唱《红灯记》完全表现了中国人民在我们伟大领袖毛主席和中国共产党的领导下前赴后继的斗争生活。从此，钢琴这个西洋乐器开始表现我国现代斗争生活，为社会主义的英雄人物而歌唱了。钢琴音域宽广、表现力强、更能描写人物的丰富感情。用钢琴来伴唱京剧《红灯记》，就使这个戏中的英雄人物精神世界更加丰富，形象更加高大。钢琴音响雄伟，气势磅礴，我们听了李玉和“刑场斗争”的一段钢琴伴唱以后，就感到李玉和对敌人有泰山压顶之势，一个智勇双全的英雄形象，更加完美、更加生动、更加高大地显现在我们的面前了。
    钢琴伴唱《红灯记》，第一次把西洋乐器用来为工农兵服务，为无产阶级政治服务，这是一个可喜的收获。我们工人也要学习用毛泽东思想武装起来的革命文艺工作者敢于打破旧框框的革命精神，进一步“抓革命，促生产”，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
    唐诃、生茂（战友文工团）：
    钢琴伴唱《红灯记》是无产阶级革命文艺的新品种，是江青同志亲自培育出来的又一朵闪耀着毛泽东思想光辉的鲜花。我们热烈欢呼毛主席革命文艺路线的又一新胜利，并热烈祝贺中央乐团和中国京剧团创作、演出钢琴伴唱《红灯记》的成功！
    多年来，中国赫鲁晓夫及其在文艺界的代理人，为了复辟资本主义，极力推行修正主义文艺黑线，疯狂抵制毛主席的革命文艺路线，拒不执行江青同志早在一九六四年就提出的钢琴要为现代京剧伴唱的重要指示。他们吹捧的是那些歌颂资产阶级和洋才子佳人的所谓世界名牌大作，或者是一些风花雪月、消磨斗志的小品，用以毒害劳动人民，把钢琴作为复辟资本主义的罪恶工具。而广大工农兵群众，对这样的钢琴演奏是十分厌恶的。
    在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，广大工农兵群众和革命文艺战士在江青同志率领下，奋起毛泽东思想的千钧棒，砸烂了修正主义文艺黑线，工农兵占领了文艺舞台。在攻克京剧、芭蕾舞、交响乐一个又一个的顽固堡垒之后，今天又胜利地夺取了钢琴这一阵地，创作了钢琴伴唱《红灯记》。这就使长期为资产阶级老爷、太太、少爷、小姐服务的这一西洋乐器——钢琴，开始为工农兵服务了。由于在钢琴伴唱《红灯记》中充分发挥了钢琴音域宽广、气势宏伟、表现力丰富的特长，更好地塑造了李玉和、李铁梅等高大的英雄形象，广大工农兵听了之后，无不受到极大的鼓舞和深刻的教育。
    钢琴伴唱《红灯记》，是贯彻执行毛主席“古为今用，洋为中用”这一光辉思想所取得的丰硕成果。钢琴伴唱《红灯记》，使西洋钢琴艺术和中国的京剧艺术做到了完美的结合。它既保持了京剧唱腔的基本特点和特有的民族形式、民族风格，又充分发挥了钢琴所特有的表现力。在钢琴伴唱《红灯记》中，如《都有一颗红亮的心》一段唱，钢琴伴奏是明朗、欢快而富有朝气的，这就把李铁梅天真、热情，稍带几分稚气的性格刻划得十分生动、逼真、维妙维肖。又如《做人要做这样的人》，是一段较抒情的唱腔。演员唱“表叔甘愿流血牺牲。他们到底为什么？”这两句时，用了轻声唱法，钢琴伴奏在这里只用了很洗练的几个音，却特别引人入胜，把演员极为深沉而细腻的感情，衬托得淋漓尽致。在唱“为的是救中国、救穷人，打败日本兵”之前的间奏中，钢琴弹得激昂慷慨，引出了铁梅气势磅礴的唱腔。当唱到“爹爹挑担有千斤重”时，钢琴用了坚实有力的和弦，加强了这个“重”字，很好地表达了铁梅那种不畏强暴、勇挑重担的决心。仅从以上几个例子，就可以说明，由于发挥了钢琴伴奏的特长，这就大大地丰富了京剧音乐，收到了中西结合，取长补短的效果，为西洋乐器和交响乐开辟了一条新的道路，为我国戏曲伴奏开辟了一条新的道路。我们坚信，钢琴伴唱《红灯记》创作、演出的成功，不仅会推动我国戏曲艺术的蓬勃发展，而且会使在无产阶级文化大革命中创造和发展起来的各种工农兵新文艺之花，在毛泽东思想的阳光照耀下，开得更加灿烂辉煌！
    因为我们学习很不够，以上只是在学习过程中一点感想。对于江青同志为我们创造这一新的样板，我们部队革命音乐工作者，更要认真学习。今后要更好地深入工农兵群众，努力改造世界观，更好地为工农兵服务。
    发扬了大无畏的革命的首创精神
    张志兴（麦贤得所在艇“海上英雄艇”艇长）：
    过去，听说钢琴是一种“高级”的乐器，只能弹奏十八、十九世纪资产阶级的古典名曲，弹一般歌曲就是降低了它的身份；只能供那些脑满肠肥的老爷、太太、小姐消遣，工农兵是没有资格欣赏的。几百年来，钢琴就是这样贴着“高级”的商标，摆在那些贵族老爷的客厅里，成了他们的“专有品”。
    钢琴艺术要不要革命？能不能革命？过去，文艺界的反革命修正主义分子周扬一伙及其总后台中国赫鲁晓夫，是不让碰的。他们象假洋鬼子一样，挥舞着“文明棍”，不许革命，压制革命。早在一九六四年，江青同志就根据毛主席“古为今用，洋为中用”的光辉思想，指示要钢琴为革命现代京剧伴唱。可是，那一小撮反革命修正主义分子却横加封锁，拒不执行，使这一重要指示迟迟不能和革命文艺战士见面。
    轰轰烈烈的无产阶级文化大革命，彻底粉碎了这一小撮阶级敌人的罪恶阴谋。在无产阶级文化大革命大好形势的鼓舞下，革命文艺战士起来造了他们的反，缴了他们的“文明棍”，发挥大无畏的革命首创精神，破除迷信，敢想、敢干、敢革命，敢于走自己的路，敢于走别人没有走过的路。钢琴是个不能碰的“音乐之王”吗？革命文艺战士以豪迈的英雄气概，敢于去冲；钢琴不能为现代革命京剧伴唱吗？革命文艺战士以坚韧不拔的革命意志，敢于去闯；钢琴不能为工农兵服务吗？革命文艺战士以坚定不移的决心，敢于去立。在江青同志的亲切关怀和热情指导下，他们经过反复实践，终于成功地创作了钢琴伴唱《红灯记》。从此，钢琴从贵族老爷的客厅搬上了工农兵的舞台；铿锵有力的革命强音代替了软绵绵的靡靡之音；没落腐朽的钢琴艺术，变成了为工农兵群众所喜闻乐见的革命的艺术。
    从八个革命样板戏到钢琴伴唱《红灯记》的诞生，都证明了一个真理：掌握了毛泽东思想，什么人间奇迹都能创造出来。在“八·六”海战中，为什么我们一艘小小的炮艇能击沉比我们大好多倍的敌舰呢？靠的是战无不胜的毛泽东思想。为什么麦贤得同志身负重伤之后，还能坚守战斗岗位？靠的是战无不胜的毛泽东思想。有了毛泽东思想，我们就能压倒一切敌人，敌人却压不倒我们。
    今后，我们要更加努力活学活用毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想武装自己的头脑；更进一步发扬“八·六”海战的精神，只要敌人胆敢侵犯，定叫它覆灭于大海之中，有来无回！
    牛书亭（北海舰队某观通站站长）：
    钢琴伴唱《红灯记》的成功，大长了我们工农兵的志气，大灭了资产阶级的威风。这是江青同志率领革命文艺战士，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，破除迷信，敢想、敢干、敢革命所取得的丰硕成果。
    革命文艺战士大无畏的革命首创精神，给了我们很大的鼓舞。用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民，就是要走自己的路，要做前人所没有做过的事。我们观通站处于祖国东方的最前哨，我们日夜警惕地守卫在海防线上。几年来，我们在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，发扬敢想敢干的革命精神，狠破苏修的洋框框，决心走自己的路。当我们碰到困难时，也有同志说：算了，咱们能搞出来，还要专家干什么？但是，毛泽东思想给了我们巨大的力量。在困难面前，我们按照毛主席的教导，战略上藐视它，战术上重视它，充分依靠群众，终于在观测计算方面大大超过苏修，在保卫祖国海防的斗争中，多次出色地完成了任务。部队首长表扬我们说：用毛泽东思想武装起来的雷达兵，站得高，看得远，抓得准，眼睛最亮。
    看了革命文艺战士创作出来的无产阶级革命文艺的新品种——钢琴伴唱《红灯记》，我们受到了极大的鼓舞。我们决心以江青同志为榜样，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，敢想、敢做、敢革命，敢做前人所没有做过的事，为保卫祖国保卫毛主席当好千里眼。（附图片）
