In the midst of the triumphant songs of the hundred million revolutionary masses across the nation seizing complete victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the latest directives of our great leader Chairman Mao have been transmitted: "Universities must still be run, and here I am mainly talking about technical and engineering universities that must still be run, but the school system must be shortened, education must be revolutionized, and proletarian politics must take command, following the path of the Shanghai Machine Tool Factory in cultivating technical personnel from among the workers. Students must be selected from among workers and peasants with practical experience, sent to school for a few years, and then returned to production practice."

Chairman Mao's great directives are the battle program for carrying the proletarian educational revolution through to the end, opening up a broad path for our country to cultivate engineering and technical personnel. They are a powerful ideological weapon for completely smashing the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational and scientific and technological lines of the Chinese Khrushchev. We must study them seriously and carry them out resolutely.

Our factory is a newly built large-scale printing and dyeing factory with relatively advanced equipment. However, due to the counter-revolutionary revisionist management line pushed by the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in our factory, the development of productive forces has been severely constrained. Before the Cultural Revolution, the technical and production powers of our factory were in the hands of reactionary technical "authorities" and untransformed old technical personnel. They crazily pushed the "expert management" line, establishing a so-called "Technical Academy" with 107 people. This "Technical Academy" was actually a stronghold for the Chinese Khrushchev to push the "expert management" line, a rope binding the revolutionary enthusiasm and creativity of the broad masses of workers, and a tool for a handful of diehard capitalist-roaders within the party, together with reactionary technical "authorities," to impose bourgeois dictatorship on us revolutionary workers. They formulated more than 220,000 characters of various management regulations. Workers had to go through seven or eight procedures to carry out a technological innovation, which had to be approved before they could proceed. If they violated their regulations, they would be reprimanded at the least and punished at the most. An old worker, based on his rich practical experience, proposed a rationalization suggestion to improve the process. However, the "experts" did not approve it. This old worker conducted experiments in his spare time, but the "experts" saw it and labeled him with the hat of "sabotaging production."

These reactionary technical "authorities" were crawling and worshipping foreign things. To get foreign equipment, they wasted 1.2 million yuan of state funds. As a result, the foreign equipment was not obtained, and the original equipment was damaged, seriously affecting production. These people's minds were completely a kingdom of bourgeois individualism, selfish, and greedy for profit. They stole the fruits of workers' labor, turning workers' innovation projects into their own "papers" for publication, fraudulently obtaining high fees, and reaping both fame and profit. However, these so-called "authorities" were at a loss when it came to solving real problems in actual production. In the process of making the "high-efficiency washing machine," the workers pointed out to them that following their design scheme would not work at all. They did not put the workers in their eyes, putting on an "authority" attitude, saying, "Do as I say, whether it works or not, you don't need to worry." As a result, a large amount of manpower, material resources, and state funds were wasted, and it took several years to complete.

Since the beginning of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we proletarian revolutionaries have driven the reactionary technical "authorities" off the stage and seized back the technical and production powers. Under the guidance of the factory revolutionary committee and the help of the People's Liberation Army stationed in the factory, the broad revolutionary masses of workers in our factory have criticized the revisionist "expert management" line. They used Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to expose the crimes of the "Technical Academy," discuss the harm of the "Technical Academy," and investigate the root causes of pushing the "Technical Academy." Revolutionary technical personnel in the "Technical Academy" also stood up in revolution, joining the broad revolutionary masses to expose and denounce the crimes of the "Technical Academy" with their personal experiences.

In the revolutionary criticism, our entire factory established "technical research groups" composed of old workers, revolutionary cadres, and revolutionary technical personnel. Revolutionary technical personnel came out of the office, rushed to the machine side, participated in the production front line, and combined with the broad revolutionary workers, effectively promoting the production of our factory. Last year, our factory completed the state plan six days ahead of schedule, and in the first half of this year, it completed the state production task for the first half of the year 30 days ahead of schedule and overfulfilled it. We also implemented 85 technological innovations and technological revolution projects. The "controllable organic silicon rectifier transformer" and "high-efficiency washing machine" that have been made have reached the world's advanced level. Single-sided printing of large floral fabrics is a new technology of recent years. A handful of capitalist-roaders and reactionary technical "authorities" have been working on it for several years without success, and it is considered an insurmountable "forbidden zone." After the proletarian revolutionaries took power, they broke through this "forbidden zone" after seven days of struggle. From practice, we deeply feel that, as Chairman Mao pointed out, "the lowly are the wisest, and the noble are the most foolish."

We have done some work in the past period and achieved some results, but there is still a long way to go from Chairman Mao's teachings, and there is still a big gap compared to the Shanghai Machine Tool Factory. We must take Chairman Mao's latest directives as the guideline, take the Shanghai Machine Tool Factory as an example, follow the path of the Shanghai Machine Tool Factory in cultivating technical personnel from among the workers, and advance courageously along the course indicated by Chairman Mao.

    彻底粉碎修正主义科技路线
    石家庄印染厂革命委员会
    在全国亿万革命群众夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的凯歌声中，传来了我们伟大领袖毛主席的最新指示：“大学还是要办的，我这里主要说的是理工科大学还要办，但学制要缩短，教育要革命，要无产阶级政治挂帅，走上海机床厂从工人中培养技术人员的道路。要从有实践经验的工人农民中间选拔学生，到学校学几年以后，又回到生产实践中去。”毛主席的伟大指示，是将无产阶级教育革命进行到底的战斗纲领，开拓了我国培养工程技术人员的广阔道路，是彻底摧毁中国赫鲁晓夫反革命修正主义教育路线和科技路线的强大思想武器。我们一定认真学习，坚决照办。
    我厂是一座新建的大型印染厂，设备是比较先进的。但是，由于中国赫鲁晓夫及其在我厂的代理人，推行了一整套反革命修正主义办厂路线，严重地束缚了生产力的发展。文化大革命以前，我厂的生产技术大权，掌握在资产阶级反动技术“权威”和没有改造好的旧技术人员的手里。他们疯狂地推行“专家治厂”路线，成立所谓“技术大院”，编制达一百零七人之多。所谓“技术大院”，其实是中国赫鲁晓夫推行“专家治厂”的阵地，是束缚广大革命工人生产积极性和创造性的绳索，是厂里党内一小撮顽固不化的走资派伙同资产阶级反动技术“权威”对我们革命工人实行资产阶级专政的工具。他们制定了有二十二万多字的各种管理规定，工人搞一项技术革新要经过七、八道手续，必须经过批准才能搞，如果触犯了他们的规定，轻则训斥，重则处分。有一个老工人，根据丰富的生产实践经验，提出了一项改进工艺的合理化建议，但是，“专家”不批准。这个老工人就利用工余时间试验，被“专家”们看见了，竟给扣上了“破坏生产”的帽子。
      这些资产阶级反动技术“权威”，大搞爬行主义，崇洋媚外。为了搞洋设备，他们不惜浪费了国家一百二十万元。结果“洋”设备没搞成，还使原有设备遭到破坏，生产受到严重影响。这些家伙的脑子里完全是资产阶级个人主义的独立王国，自私自利，利欲熏心。他们窃取了工人的劳动成果，把工人搞出的革新项目，写成自己的“论文”发表，诈取高额稿费，名利双收。对于实际生产中真正要解决的问题，他们这些所谓“权威”却一筹莫展。在搞“高效水洗机”的过程中，工人们向他们指出，照他们设计的方案去搞，根本就不能用。他们不把工人放在眼里，摆出“权威”的架势，说什么：“叫你咋干你就咋干，能用不能用你不要管。”结果，浪费了大量人力、物力和国家资金，搞了几年也没有搞成。
    无产阶级文化大革命开始以来，我们无产阶级革命派，把资产阶级反动技术“权威”赶下了台，夺回了生产技术大权。我厂广大革命职工在厂革委会和驻厂人民解放军的帮助下，对修正主义的“专家治厂”路线，进行了批判。他们以毛泽东思想为武器，大揭“技术大院”的罪行，大议“技术大院”的危害，大查推行“技术大院”的根源。“技术大院”中革命的技术人员，也纷纷起来革命，和广大革命职工一道，以亲身经历揭发控诉“技术大院”的罪行。
    在革命大批判中，我们全厂普遍建立了有老工人、革命干部和革命的技术人员参加的三结合“技术研究小组”。革命的技术人员走出办公室，奔向机器旁，参加生产第一线，和广大革命工人相结合，有力地促进了我厂的生产。去年我厂提前六天完成了国家计划，今年上半年又提前三十天超额完成上半年国家生产任务。我们还实现了八十五项技术革新、技术革命项目，已制成的“可控有机硅整流变压器”、“高效水洗机”，达到了世界先进水平。单面印大花布是近几年的新技术，一小撮走资派和反动技术“权威”搞了几年搞不成，被认为是不可超越的“禁区”。无产阶级革命派掌权后，经过七天的奋战，终于冲破了这个“禁区”。从实践中，我们深深体会到，正象毛主席指出的：“卑贱者最聪明，高贵者最愚蠢”。
    我们在前段时间作了一些工作，取得了一些成绩，但是距离毛主席的教导还差得很远，跟上海机床厂比较，还有很大的差距。我们一定要以毛主席的最新指示为纲，以上海机床厂为榜样，走上海机床厂从工人中培养技术人员的道路，按照毛主席指引的航道奋勇前进。
