The revolutionary masses of Huzhu Tu Autonomous County closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, with everyone striving to become a critic. The revolution-wide criticism has bloomed and borne fruit, promoting the widespread dissemination of Mao Zedong Thought, raising the revolutionary masses' awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines, and developing a great situation. The entire county is brimming with revolutionary and productive fervor.

XINING, July 10 (Xinhua) — The revolutionary committees at various levels in Huzhu Tu Autonomous County, Qinghai Province, have led the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary masses to actively study and apply Mao Zedong Thought. They have deeply and persistently carried out revolution-wide criticism, which has effectively promoted the thought revolutionization of the people. The revolutionary and productive situation in the entire county presents a vibrant scene.

Since the establishment of the revolutionary committee of Huzhu Tu Autonomous County in November last year, it has placed the leadership of the broad revolutionary masses in actively studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought at the forefront of all work. It has made the deep and persistent carrying out of revolution-wide criticism in rural areas across the county a primary task. Members of the county revolutionary committee frequently go deep into the masses to conduct investigations and research, summarize the advanced experiences of poor and lower-middle peasants in actively studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought and carrying out revolution-wide criticism. They promote and introduce these experiences to revolutionary committees at various levels below the county through telephone conferences, regional meetings, and other means, urging them to firmly grasp revolution-wide criticism. Under the leadership of the county and various levels of revolutionary committees, revolution-wide criticism in rural areas across the county has been carried out vigorously and solidly, with notable characteristics of being swift, widespread, and deep. Swift means following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, acting decisively and deeply carrying out revolution-wide criticism. Widespread means that all poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary masses across the county participate, with everyone taking up the pen to criticize and strive to become a critic. Deep means combining revolution-wide criticism with the new situation, new characteristics, and new problems of class struggle, carrying it out deeply and persistently, making revolution-wide criticism combine with the purification of class ranks, the rectification of party organizations, the struggle-criticism-transformation of local units, and the destruction of selfishness and the establishment of public spirit, blooming and bearing fruit everywhere.

Chairman Mao said: "Without destruction, there can be no construction. Destruction is criticism and revolution. Destruction requires reasoning, and reasoning is construction. With destruction at the forefront, construction is also within it." The revolutionary committees at various levels in Huzhu Tu Autonomous County have led the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary masses to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, deeply and persistently carrying out revolution-wide criticism, developing a great situation. The revolutionary and productive situation in the entire county is excellent and getting better.

1. The mass movement of actively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works has flourished in rural areas across the county, effectively promoting the widespread dissemination of Mao Zedong Thought.

The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary masses study Chairman Mao's relevant works and latest instructions before each criticism meeting. During the meeting, they use the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to fight, and review Chairman Mao's relevant works and latest instructions during the summary. In the revolution-wide criticism, every step is guided by what Chairman Mao teaches and how Khrushchev poisons. Thus, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary masses further recognize that Mao Zedong Thought points the way to victory for the revolutionary people and opens the path to victory. Mao Zedong Thought is the foundation of revolution, and without Mao Zedong Thought, one cannot take a single step. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants say: "Our heads can be cut off, our blood can flow, but we cannot abandon Mao Zedong Thought." Therefore, they are even more conscious of actively studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought. They establish large-scale Mao Zedong Thought study classes, extensively study, recite, lecture, and apply Chairman Mao's works and his latest instructions, using Mao Zedong Thought to guide everything. Some elderly ethnic minorities, who used to wear feudal superstition "Mantras" on their chests, now keep the red "Quotations from Chairman Mao" close to their hearts and wear Chairman Mao's badges; ethnic Tu youths who used to sing feudal superstition "Flowers" and "Drinking Songs" now compete in reciting and applying the "Three Articles," and singing songs from the "Quotations from Chairman Mao."

2. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary masses have raised their awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines, enhancing their discriminatory abilities.

Through the practice of revolution-wide criticism, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary masses further recognize that under the dictatorship of the proletariat, class struggle is concentrated and prominently manifested as the struggle between the two lines within the party. The most dangerous class enemies are those who hide within the proletarian dictatorship apparatus, waving the red flag to oppose the red flag, a small handful of capitalist-roaders within the party. To identify and defeat such class enemies, one must continuously raise awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines, and in any stormy waves, firmly stand on Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and wage uncompromising struggle against the enemy. Through revolution-wide criticism, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary masses have further clarified what is Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and what is Khrushchev's bourgeois reactionary line; what is socialism and what is capitalism. They have learned to use Mao Zedong Thought to timely analyze and identify the various tricks of class enemies. In a previous period, a small handful of capitalist-roaders within the party in Huzhu Tu Autonomous County and untransformed landlords, rich farmers, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists in society secretly fanned the wind and lit the fire, spreading rumors and stirring up a rightist wind of reversal, attempting to sabotage the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants timely exposed the tricks of the class enemies, conducted extensive exposure, criticism, and struggle against the enemy, quickly smashing the rightist wind of reversal, and further consolidating the newly established revolutionary committees.

3. The broad masses of community members have further raised their socialist awareness, establishing the idea of farming for the revolution.

In the revolution-wide criticism, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary masses used Mao Zedong Thought to severely criticize Khrushchev's and his agents' counter-revolutionary revisionist black goods such as "material incentives" and "work points as the commander." At the same time, they severely fought against the "selfishness" in their own minds, further establishing the idea of farming for the revolution. On this basis, many production teams have established Dazhai-style labor management systems of "working selflessly for the public and reporting work points through public discussion," greatly consolidating and developing the socialist collective economy.

4. Achieving great victories in seizing the revolution and promoting production.

Chairman Mao personally presided over the formulation of the "Sixteen Points," which states: "The Cultural Revolution of the proletariat is to make people's thoughts revolutionary, thereby making all work done better, faster, and more efficiently." Through revolution-wide criticism, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary masses have further raised their socialist awareness, and a new situation of "six more, six less" has emerged in rural areas. That is, more people love the collective, fewer people focus on their private plots; more people cherish public property, fewer people embezzle public funds for private gain; more people strive hard, fewer people waste; more people insist on self-reliance, fewer people rely solely on the state; more people volunteer for heavy tasks, fewer people shirk responsibilities; more people are selfless and dedicated, fewer people quarrel and cause trouble. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary masses have unprecedented revolutionary enthusiasm, with many community members achieving a 100% attendance rate, making the production front vibrant with revolutionary spirit. Last year, the entire county achieved a bumper harvest in agriculture. This spring's farming production is of higher quality and more fertilized than last year. Currently, community members are strengthening field management. Agricultural infrastructure construction and afforestation have also developed significantly compared to previous years.

    互助土族自治县广大革命群众紧跟毛主席伟大战略部署人人争当批判家
    革命大批判遍地开花结果
    促进了毛泽东思想的大普及，提高了广大革命群众阶级斗争和两条路线斗争的觉悟，发展了大好形势，全县革命和生产热气腾腾
    新华社西宁十日电　青海省互助土族自治县各级革命委员会带领广大贫下中农和革命群众活学活用毛泽东思想，深入持久地开展革命大批判，有力地促进了人的思想革命化，全县革命和生产呈现出一派热气腾腾的景象。
    去年十一月，互助土族自治县革命委员会成立以后，就把带领全县广大革命群众活学活用毛泽东思想摆在一切工作的首位，把在全县农村深入持久地开展革命大批判当作主要任务来抓。县革委会成员经常深入群众调查研究，总结贫下中农创造的活学活用毛泽东思想，搞好革命大批判的先进经验，并通过电话会议、区域会议等形式，向县以下各级革命委员会推广、介绍，促进他们狠抓革命大批判。在县和各级革命委员会的领导下，全县农村革命大批判搞得轰轰烈烈，扎扎实实，它的显著特点是：快、广、深。快，就是紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，雷厉风行，深入开展革命大批判。广，就是全县广大贫下中农和革命群众个个上阵，人人口诛笔伐，争当批判家。深，就是结合阶级斗争的新形势、新特点、新问题，把革命大批判深入持久地开展下去，使革命大批判同清理阶级队伍结合起来，同整顿党的组织结合起来，同本单位的斗批改和破私立公结合起来，遍地开花结果。
    毛主席说：“不破不立。破，就是批判，就是革命。破，就要讲道理，讲道理就是立，破字当头，立也就在其中了。”互助土族自治县各级革命委员会带领广大贫下中农和革命群众，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，深入持久地开展革命大批判，发展了大好形势，全县革命和生产形势一片大好，越来越好。
    一、全县农村活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动蓬勃发展，有力地促进了毛泽东思想的大普及。
    广大贫下中农和革命群众在每一次批判会前，都学习毛主席的有关著作和最新指示，在批判会上以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器进行战斗，总结时又重温毛主席的有关著作和最新指示。在革命大批判中，每一步都是看毛主席是怎样教导的，中国赫鲁晓夫是怎样放毒的。这样，广大贫下中农和革命群众就更进一步认识到毛泽东思想为革命人民指明了胜利的方向，开辟了胜利的道路，毛泽东思想是干革命的根本，离开了毛泽东思想就寸步难行。广大贫下中农说：“头可断，血可流，毛泽东思想不能丢”，因此，更加自觉地活学活用毛泽东思想。他们大办毛泽东思想学习班，大学、大背、大讲、大用毛主席著作和毛主席的最新指示，用毛泽东思想统帅一切。有些白发苍苍的少数民族老人，过去胸前挂着封建迷信的“玛尼”，现在贴心的地方装着红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，戴着毛主席像章；过去爱唱封建迷信的“花儿”、“酒曲”的土族青年，如今都在赛背赛用“老三篇”，赛唱毛主席语录歌。
    二、广大贫下中农和革命群众提高了阶级斗争和两条路线斗争的觉悟，增强了鉴别能力。
    在革命大批判的实践中，广大贫下中农和革命群众进一步认识到，在无产阶级专政条件下，阶级斗争集中地突出地表现为党内两条路线的斗争，最危险的阶级敌人是暗藏在无产阶级专政机构内部打着红旗反红旗的党内一小撮走资派。要识别和打倒这样的阶级敌人，就必须不断提高阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟，在任何惊涛骇浪中都要坚决站在毛主席革命路线一边，和敌人作无情的斗争。广大贫下中农和革命群众经过革命大批判，更认清了什么是毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，什么是中国赫鲁晓夫的资产阶级反动路线；什么是社会主义，什么是资本主义。学会了用毛泽东思想及时分析识别阶级敌人的各种阴谋诡计。前一个时期，互助土族自治县党内一小撮走资派和社会上没有改造好的地富反坏右分子，暗地里煽阴风，点鬼火，制造谣言，刮起一股右倾翻案妖风，妄图破坏无产阶级文化大革命。广大贫下中农及时识破了阶级敌人的阴谋，对敌人进行了大揭发、大批判、大斗争，迅速粉碎了右倾翻案妖风，进一步巩固了新生的革命委员会。
    三、广大社员进一步提高了社会主义觉悟，树立了为革命种田的思想。
    在革命大批判中，广大贫下中农和革命群众，用毛泽东思想狠批了中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人的“物质刺激”、“工分挂帅”等反革命修正主义黑货，同时，狠斗了自己头脑中的“私”字，进一步树立了为革命种田的思想。在这个基础上，有很多生产队建立了大寨式的“一心为公劳动，自报公议工分”的劳动管理制度，大大巩固和发展了社会主义集体经济。
    四、获得了抓革命、促生产的伟大胜利。
    毛主席亲自主持制定的“十六条”中指出：“无产阶级文化大革命，就是为的要使人的思想革命化，因而使各项工作做得更多、更快、更好、更省。”经过革命大批判，广大贫下中农和革命群众进一步提高了社会主义觉悟，农村中普遍出现了“六多六少”的新气象。即热爱集体的多了，在自留地里下功夫的少了；爱护公共财物的多了，损公肥私的少了；艰苦奋斗的多了，铺张浪费的少了；坚持自力更生的多了，单纯依赖国家的少了；抢着挑重担子的多了，耍奸溜滑的少了；毫不利己专门利人的多了，互不团结闹纠纷的少了。广大贫下中农和革命群众革命干劲空前高涨，许多社、队社员的出勤率达到了百分之百，因而生产战线上到处是一片热气腾腾的革命景象。去年全县农业夺得了大丰收。今年春耕生产比去年质量高，施肥多，目前社员正在加强田间管理。农田基本建设、植树造林也都比往年有了很大的发展。
