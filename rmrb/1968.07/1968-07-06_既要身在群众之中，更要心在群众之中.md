The revolutionary committee of the Hohhot City Transportation Company was established not long ago. Due to the lack of experience among most of the new cadres, they were busy handling daily affairs, keeping themselves in the office, and some comrades temporarily detached themselves from the masses. The PLA comrades stationed at the transportation company to support the left discovered this problem. They studied together with the members of the revolutionary committee the great teachings of Chairman Mao: "Serve the people wholeheartedly, never leave the masses for a moment" and "The most fundamental aspect of reforming state organs is to link up with the masses." After studying and discussing, the revolutionary committee decided to immediately organize all its members to go to the grassroots for labor. After going down, the committee members worked with the workers to deliver coal and charcoal to poor peasants and poor herdsmen, and to deliver grass and grain. They also helped the families of the workers to plaster walls and build kangs, which was welcomed by the masses.

Soon after, there were discussions among the masses: "They are physically at the grassroots, but their hearts are in the office." Some said: "They participate in labor, but it's different from us workers." What was the real problem? The revolutionary committee, with this question in mind, organized everyone to study Chairman Mao's teachings. Chairman Mao said: "Everywhere you go, you should blend in with the local people, not stand above them, but immerse yourself among them." Chairman Mao's teachings deeply educated the members of the revolutionary committee. They realized that the masses' reflections hit the nail on the head. Previously, they had only physically gone to the masses, but their hearts had not yet been with the masses, and they had not truly blended in with the masses. The deputy head of the revolutionary committee said: "To go to the masses, you must root yourself in the masses' thoughts and have a fundamental change in your feelings. You must love what the masses love, worry about what the masses worry about, and think about what the masses think about. You must see the masses in your eyes and think about the masses in your heart, and rely on the masses for your work. You must be like Comrade Jiao Yulu, who 'had the whole people in his heart,' and like Comrade Deng Zihui, who 'wanted to be the people's ox for life, pulling the revolution's cart for life.'"

With their ideological understanding raised, the committee members went to the grassroots again. Not only did they eat, live, and work with the masses, but they also often had heart-to-heart talks with the masses, studied Chairman Mao's works together, engaged in self-criticism and criticized revisionism together, promoted revolution and production together, and humbly learned from the masses, sincerely becoming students of the masses. They truly became one of the masses.

At the same time, the PLA support personnel helped the revolutionary committee use the army's experience to organize "democratic meetings" to widely solicit the masses' opinions. The members of the revolutionary committee also went to the workshops and dormitories to solicit the masses' opinions and accept the revolutionary masses' criticism and supervision. They fully carried out democracy, making sure to listen to opinions without considering the occasion, method, or attitude, whether in large meetings or small meetings, in meetings or outside meetings, and ensuring that "speakers are without guilt, and listeners are sufficiently warned." The masses were satisfied and said: The revolutionary committee is good!

    既要身在群众之中，更要心在群众之中
    呼和浩特市运输公司革命委员会成立不久，由于多数新干部缺乏经验，忙于处理日常事务，把自己关在办公室里，有的同志一度脱离了群众。驻运输公司支左的解放军同志发现这个问题以后，同革委会成员一起反复学习了毛主席“全心全意地为人民服务，一刻也不脱离群众”和“国家机关的改革，最根本的一条，就是联系群众”的伟大教导。经过学习讨论，革委会作出决定，立即组织所有革委会成员到基层劳动。革委会成员下去后，和工人同志一起给贫下中农和贫苦牧民送煤送炭，送草送粮，还给工人家属抹房垒炕，受到了群众的欢迎。
    过了不久，群众中又有议论：“他们‘身’在基层，‘心’在办公室。”还有的说：“人家参加劳动，跟咱们工人不一样”。这究竟是什么问题？革委会带着这个问题，组织大家学习毛主席的教导。毛主席说：“每到一地，就和那里的群众打成一片，不是高踞于群众之上，而是深入于群众之中”。毛主席的教导，深深教育了革委会成员。他们认识到，群众的反映正抓住了要害，以前深入群众只是“身”入了，“心”还没入，没有真正同群众打成一片。革委会副主任说：“深入群众，就要在思想上扎根于群众，感情上要有一个根本变化，要爱群众所爱，急群众所急，想群众所想。要眼里看着群众，心里想着群众，工作依靠群众。要象焦裕禄同志那样‘心里装着全体人民’，象门合同志那样‘当一辈子人民的牛，拉一辈子革命的车’。”
    思想认识提高了，委员们再到基层，不但和群众同吃同住同劳动，还经常同群众谈心交心，一起学习毛主席著作，一起斗私批修，一起抓革命促生产，恭恭敬敬地向群众学习，老老实实地当群众的小学生。他们真正成了群众中的一员。
    在这同时，部队支左人员还帮助革委会运用部队的经验，组织“民主会”，广泛征求群众的意见。革委会的成员也分别到车间、宿舍征求群众意见，接受革命群众的批评监督。他们充分发扬民主，做到了听取意见不计较场合、方式、态度，不分大会小会、会上会下，做到了“言者无罪，闻者足戒”。群众满意地说：革命委员会就是好！
