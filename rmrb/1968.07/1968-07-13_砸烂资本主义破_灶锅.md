The counter-revolutionary novel *Storm* is a major poisonous weed created to manufacture public opinion for Liu Shaoqi's usurpation and restoration of capitalism.

The protagonist of the book, the "hero" of the bourgeois headquarters, Zhu Yongkang, reveals his evil plot on the very first day he arrives in Huangni Township. He says in Chunfang's home that the stoves in Huabei are short and dirty, with a lot of smoke. "If I work here, I must issue an order to have all the sealed stoves demolished..." This seems to be a common remark about daily life, but in fact, it is the political jargon of the bourgeois headquarters led by Liu Shaoqi. These reactionaries want to overthrow the dictatorship of the proletariat, "build another stove," establish bourgeois dictatorship, and restore capitalism.

The counter-revolutionary Chen Dengke, following Liu Shaoqi's instructions, in *Storm* strongly promotes individual farming and the reversal of verdicts, vigorously advocating the rightist line disguised as "leftist." This counter-revolutionary openly declares that he wants to find the so-called "truth of the Party" again. Whose truth do they want to find? They want to find the "truth" of the bourgeoisie, that is, Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist line. It is clear that Chen Dengke and his gang are attempting to overthrow the leadership of our Party, "build another stove," and let Liu Shaoqi usurp the Party and restore capitalism. The great, glorious, and correct Communist Party of China is the Party personally founded by our great leader Chairman Mao, armed with the truth of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. A small handful of class enemies want to "build another stove" and overthrow our Party; this is like an ant trying to shake a big tree, laughable and ridiculous!

To "build another stove," let the landlords, rich farmers, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, rightists, and the Kuomintang reactionaries return to power, Chen Dengke in *Storm* also maliciously slanders Party cadres, depicting all Party organizations as utterly corrupt.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "We should believe that more than 90 percent of the cadres are good or fairly good." Under the wise leadership of our great leader Chairman Mao, the majority of cadres hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, firmly stand on Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and resolutely lead the people to follow Chairman Mao on the broad road to socialism. A few bad elements have infiltrated the revolutionary ranks, but Chen Dengke, this counter-revolutionary, slanders rural cadres as utterly corrupt. From the county to the district, from the district to the township, there are no good cadres. The county Party secretary Fang Xuedong is a hardworking bureaucrat. The district Party secretary Xiong Bin has a waning revolutionary will and has seriously lost his class standpoint. The township Party branch secretary Zhu Xikun openly advocates the "Ten Freedoms," full of reactionary statements. The township head Wan Shounian is an incompetent who only knows how to distribute relief grain without caring about politics. In short, all Party cadres are no good and should be removed. In one word, they want to "build another stove." This is extremely reactionary!

After Zhu Yongkang takes office, he decides to follow the "deep" footprints Liu Shaoqi left in Huabei. It is clear that the "stove" Chen Dengke and his gang want to "build" is the capitalist restoration that Liu Shaoqi has long dreamed of. This is the wolfish ambition of the counter-revolutionary Chen Dengke and his gang!

Let us raise the thousand-jin hammer of Mao Zedong Thought, hoist the great banner of revolutionary criticism, and smash to pieces the capitalist "stove" that Liu Shaoqi and his henchmen want to "build"!

    砸烂资本主义破“灶锅”
    北京市新华印刷厂批判《风雷》战斗组
    反动小说《风雷》是为中国赫鲁晓夫篡党复辟制造舆论的大毒草。
    书中的主人公、资产阶级司令部的理想“英雄”祝永康，第一天到黄泥乡，就透露了自己的罪恶阴谋。他在春芳家说淮北的灶锅又矮又脏，烟气很大。“……我要是在这里工作，非下命令不可，要各家把闷灶锅拆除……”。看来这似乎是一般的生活用语，其实，这是以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部的政治黑话。这批反动家伙，就是要推翻无产阶级专政，“另砌灶锅”，建立资产阶级专政，复辟资本主义。
    反革命分子陈登科，秉承中国赫鲁晓夫的旨意，在《风雷》中大刮单干风，大刮翻案风，竭力宣扬形“左”实右的资产阶级反动路线。这个反革命分子公开声称，要重新寻找所谓“党的真理”。他们要寻找哪家的真理？他们要寻找的就是资产阶级的“真理”，即是中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义路线。很清楚，陈登科这一伙，就是妄图推翻我们党的领导，“另砌灶锅”，让中国赫鲁晓夫篡党复辟。伟大、光荣、正确的中国共产党，是我们伟大领袖毛主席亲手缔造的党，是用马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的真理武装起来的党。一小撮阶级敌人妄想“另砌灶锅”，推翻我们的党，真是蚍蜉撼大树，可笑不自量！
    为了“另砌灶锅”，让地、富、反、坏、右和国民党反动派重新上台，陈登科在《风雷》中又大肆污蔑党的干部，把所有党的组织都描写得一团漆黑。
    毛主席教导我们：“要相信百分之九十以上的干部是好的和比较好的。”在伟大领袖毛主席的英明领导下，广大干部高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚决站在毛主席革命路线一边，坚定地率领人民群众跟着毛主席走社会主义的康庄大道。混入革命队伍中的坏人只是一小撮。可是，陈登科这个反革命分子却污蔑农村干部一团糟，都坏了。从县到区，从区到乡，没有一个好干部。县委书记方旭东是个“辛辛苦苦”的官僚主义者。区委书记熊彬，革命意志衰退，严重丧失阶级立场。黄泥乡总支书记朱锡坤，公然宣扬“十大自由”，反动言论一大堆。乡长万寿年是个不问政治，只知发救济粮的庸人。总之，所有党的干部都不行，都应该下台。一句话，就是要“另砌灶锅”。真是反动透顶！
    祝永康走马上任以后，就决心沿着中国赫鲁晓夫在淮北这块土地上留下的“很深”的“足印”走。很明显，陈登科之流要“另砌”的“灶锅”，就是中国赫鲁晓夫梦寐以求的资本主义复辟。这就是反革命分子陈登科之流的狼子野心！
    让我们奋起毛泽东思想的千钧棒，高举革命的批判大旗，把中国赫鲁晓夫及其喽罗们要“另砌”的资本主义破“灶锅”砸个粉碎！
