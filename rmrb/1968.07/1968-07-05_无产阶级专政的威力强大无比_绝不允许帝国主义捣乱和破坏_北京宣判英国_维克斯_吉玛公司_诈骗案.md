The Beijing Intermediate People's Court held a sentencing rally. The judgment stated that the defendant used trade as a cover to steal intelligence from China, intentionally engage in sabotage and fraud, and attempt to endanger China's security and sabotage China's socialist construction. The judgment declared the contract signed by the defendant with China to be immediately null and void; the defendant's personnel in China were ordered to leave within a specified time; and compensation was to be paid for economic losses.

Xinhua News Agency, July 4th: The Beijing Intermediate People's Court held a rally on July 3rd titled "Holding High the Great Red Banner of Mao Zedong Thought, Sentencing the British 'Vickers-Gimma Company' Fraud Case." The defendant, the British "Vickers-Gimma Company," did not dare to appear for the trial, and the rally proceeded with an in absentia judgment.

To safeguard China's security, socialist construction, and the victories of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the Beijing Intermediate People's Court ruled: The contract signed by the defendant, the British "Vickers-Gimma Company," with the China National Technical Import Corporation on November 25, 1964, is immediately null and void from the date of this judgment; the "Vickers-Gimma Company" personnel in China are to leave within ten days from the date of this judgment; the "Vickers-Gimma Company" is to compensate the China National Technical Import Corporation for economic losses amounting to 650,000 pounds. This solemn judgment fully demonstrates the immense power of the dictatorship of the proletariat in our country.

After the sentencing rally began, the revolutionary masses read the great leader Chairman Mao's teachings: "The imperialists and domestic reactionaries will not resign themselves to their defeat. They will still make their last struggle. After the country is pacified, they will still engage in sabotage and disruption in various ways every day and every hour, attempting to restore their rule in China. This is inevitable and beyond doubt. We must not relax our vigilance."

The representative of the Beijing Intermediate People's Court read the judgment.

The judgment stated that the defendant, the British "Vickers-Gimma Company," signed a contract with the China National Technical Import Corporation on November 25, 1964, to supply a factory to the China National Technical Import Corporation. Over the course of more than three years of contract execution, it was proven that the defendant, the British "Vickers-Gimma Company," did not fulfill the contract as stipulated and intentionally engaged in fraud. The so-called technical personnel it sent to China were either unqualified or impersonated technical personnel who were spy elements. Spy element George Watt, before coming to China, received the task of collecting intelligence from the company's responsible person, Jay, and during his time in China, he stole a large amount of important intelligence on China's military, politics, economy, and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, actively serving the aggressive policies of British imperialism and opposing the People's Republic of China. The criminal has been sentenced by the Lanzhou Intermediate People's Court of Gansu Province. Another so-called engineer, Peter Dickart, also engaged in spy intelligence activities in China and has been expelled from the country by China's public security organs.

The judgment stated that the contract stipulated that the defendant, the British "Vickers-Gimma Company," would supply the China National Technical Import Corporation with the most modern design and technology, the best quality equipment and materials; and guarantee the data specified in the contract. However, it was proven that the defendant did not master the main technology of the contract factory and repeatedly played tricks. In other aspects such as the delivery of technical documents, the supply of equipment and materials, and the arrangement of trainees, the defendant also consistently used delaying, evading, and denying tactics to engage in fraud.

The judgment said that the crimes of the defendant, the British "Vickers-Gimma Company," were to use trade as a cover to intentionally engage in political and economic sabotage and fraud against the People's Republic of China, attempting to endanger China's security and sabotage China's socialist construction.

The entire audience applauded warmly in support of the solemn judgment of the Beijing Intermediate People's Court. Revolutionary masses pointed out that our country is a great socialist country under the dictatorship of the proletariat. We are willing to engage in friendly cooperation with the peoples of all countries and develop international trade on the basis of equality and mutual benefit, but we will absolutely not allow any enemy to take advantage of the situation to engage in sabotage and disruption in our country. Revolutionary masses also shouted slogans: "Down with American imperialism!" "Down with British imperialism!" "Long live the dictatorship of the proletariat!" "Long live the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!" "Long live the great leader Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!"

As the sentencing rally ended, everyone sang "The Boatman's Song."

    无产阶级专政的威力强大无比　绝不允许帝国主义捣乱和破坏
    北京宣判英国“维克斯—吉玛公司”诈骗案
    北京市中级人民法院举行宣判大会。判决书指出，被告以贸易为掩护，窃取我情报，蓄意进行破坏和诈骗，企图危害我国安全和破坏我国社会主义建设。判决被告与我签订的工厂合同立即废除；被告在我国人员限期离境；赔偿我经济损失。
    新华社四日讯　北京市中级人民法院三日举行“高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，宣判英国‘维克斯—吉玛公司’诈骗案大会”。被告英国“维克斯—吉玛公司”，不敢前来应诉，大会进行缺席宣判。
    为了保卫我国的安全，保卫社会主义建设，保卫无产阶级文化大革命的胜利成果，北京市中级人民法院判决：被告英国“维克斯—吉玛公司”一九六四年十一月二十五日与中国技术进口总公司签订的工厂合同，自判决之日起立即废除；限“维克斯—吉玛公司”在中国的人员，自判决之日起十日内离境；“维克斯—吉玛公司”赔偿中国技术进口总公司的经济损失六十五万英镑。这一严正判决充分显示了我国无产阶级专政的强大威力。
    宣判大会开始后，全场革命群众朗读伟大领袖毛主席的教导：“帝国主义者和国内反动派决不甘心于他们的失败，他们还要作最后的挣扎。在全国平定以后，他们也还会以各种方式从事破坏和捣乱，他们将每日每时企图在中国复辟。这是必然的，毫无疑义的，我们务必不要松懈自己的警惕性。”
    北京市中级人民法院代表宣读判决书。
    判决书指出，被告英国“维克斯—吉玛公司”于一九六四年十一月二十五日同中国技术进口总公司签订了供应中国技术进口总公司工厂的合同。三年多来，在执行合同过程中的大量事实证明，被告英国“维克斯—吉玛公司”根本不按规定履行合同，蓄意进行诈骗。它派遣来中国的所谓技术人员，有的不称职，有的是冒充技术人员的间谍分子。间谍分子乔治·瓦特来中国前，接受该公司负责人杰伊布置的搜集情报的任务，在中国期间大量窃取了我国军事、政治、经济和无产阶级文化大革命等重要情报，积极为英帝国主义侵略政策效劳，反对中华人民共和国。该犯已被我国甘肃省兰州市中级人民法院判处。另一名所谓工程师彼德·迪卡特也在我国从事间谍情报活动，已被我国公安机关驱逐出境。
    判决书指出，合同规定，被告英国“维克斯—吉玛公司”向中国技术进口总公司供应最现代化的设计和技术，质量最优良的设备和材料；实现合同规定的保证数据，但是事实证明，被告没有掌握合同工厂的主要技术，并且一再玩弄骗局。其他如技术文件的交付，设备材料的供应及实习人员的安排等方面，被告也一贯采取拖延、推脱、抵赖等手段，进行诈骗。
    判决书说，被告英国“维克斯—吉玛公司”的罪行，是以贸易为掩护，对中华人民共和国蓄意进行的政治上、经济上的破坏和诈骗，企图危害我国安全和破坏我国社会主义建设。
    全场热烈鼓掌，拥护北京市中级人民法院的严正判决。革命群众指出，我国是一个无产阶级专政的伟大的社会主义国家。我们愿意同世界各国人民实行友好合作，并在平等互利基础上发展国际间的通商事业，但是我们决不能容许任何敌人乘机在我国进行破坏和捣乱。革命群众还高呼口号：“打倒美帝国主义！”“打倒英帝国主义！”“无产阶级专政万岁！”“无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利万岁！”“伟大领袖毛主席万岁！万万岁！”
    宣判大会结束时，全体高唱《大海航行靠舵手》。
