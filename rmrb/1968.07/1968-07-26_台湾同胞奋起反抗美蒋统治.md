Workers, peasants, urban poor, and young students in Taiwan, fearing no violence, have angrily smashed U.S.-Chiang bandit military facilities, collectively occupied Chiang bandit "official buildings," and beaten U.S. troops and their running dogs in Taiwan, causing the Chiang bandits to be in a state of disarray.

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency on the 24th, the struggle of workers, peasants, urban poor, and young students in various parts of Taiwan against U.S. aggressors and the Chiang Kai-shek bandits is developing day by day. They have smashed U.S.-Chiang bandit military facilities, collectively occupied Chiang bandit "official buildings," and beaten U.S. troops and their running dogs in Taiwan, causing the Chiang bandits to be in a state of disarray.

According to reports from Taiwanese newspapers, there have been multiple so-called "rebellion incidents" in various parts of Taiwan recently. For example, in Pingtung, Taiwanese compatriots smashed the fuel pipeline of the U.S.-Chiang bandit air force, rendering 126 barrels of high-grade military gasoline unusable. In the Taichung area, the military communication lines of the U.S.-Chiang bandits have been severely damaged multiple times, with several dozen miles of wires cut. Military transportation equipment in many places in Taiwan has also been destroyed, making it "unusable."

Taiwanese newspapers also revealed that the phenomenon of Taiwanese youth being out of school and unemployed, wandering and homeless, is very serious. When they can no longer bear the accumulated grievances, they rise up to resist the evil rule of U.S. aggressors and the Chiang Kai-shek bandits, like a river overflowing or a volcano erupting. Not long ago, the Chiang Kai-shek bandits, in order to deceive Taiwanese youth who have no way to enter school or find jobs, pretended to hold a joint enrollment for a so-called five-year vocational college in Taipei City. However, they also subjected the youth who came to enroll to various difficulties, resulting in the angry resistance of Taiwanese youth. According to foreign news reports, on July 12th, about 8,000 Taiwanese youth who came to enroll, in the presence of the Chiang bandit police who were supposed to "maintain order," smashed some of the office desks in the enrollment office into pieces. Incidents of Taiwanese youth angrily destroying U.S. imperialist institutions in Taiwan and beating U.S. military and political personnel in Taiwan are also frequent.

Under the heavy exploitation of U.S. monopolies and the Chiang Kai-shek bandits, the broad masses of laboring people in Taiwan are forced to set up makeshift shacks on the streets and alleys, even on garbage heaps and by foul-smelling ditches, as their shelters. Recently, the Chiang Kai-shek sellout clique, under the pretext that these slums are "unsightly," dispatched large numbers of demolition teams and police to forcibly demolish these so-called "illegal structures" in various counties and cities. Taiwanese compatriots have risen up to resist this atrocity of the Chiang bandits. On the morning of May 29th, just as the Chiang bandit "Taipei City Council" was holding its fifth temporary session opening "ceremony," more than 30 residents of "illegal" structures on Zhongshan North Road in Taipei City angrily rushed into the venue and warned the head of the Chiang bandit pseudo "city government" not to demolish the residents' houses. In Kaohsiung City, on the morning of May 31st, more than 50 residents rushed into the Chiang bandit pseudo "Kaohsiung City Construction Bureau," protesting against the Chiang bandits' forced demolition of civilian houses and their heinous crimes of disregarding the lives of the people. The angry crowd grabbed some of the Chiang bandit officials and made them confess in public, while others smashed office furniture and beat and scolded the Chiang bandit officials, with the sound of beating and scolding filling the air. That night, they further occupied the hall and stairs of the pseudo Kaohsiung "city government," and had not left by the early morning of June 1st.

According to reports from Taiwanese newspapers, tricycle workers in Taiwan, whose lives are seriously threatened, have also launched a sustained struggle against the persecution of the Chiang bandits. On June 20th, more than 100 tricycle workers from various counties and cities in Taiwan rushed into the Chiang bandit pseudo "Chiayi County Government," protesting against the Chiang bandits' unreasonable ban on tricycles. Many people also angrily rushed upstairs to settle accounts with the pseudo "county magistrate." According to reports, recently, in central Taiwan, more than 400 tricycle workers, in order to fight for their survival, are also struggling against the Chiang bandits.

Farmers in Taiwan, who are cruelly exploited and oppressed by the U.S.-Chiang bandits, have taken up hoes, shoulder poles, and buckets as weapons to fight with the U.S.-Chiang bandits for land. According to the Taipei City "Dahua Evening News," on June 21st, more than 1,000 farmers in the Pingtung area again rushed into the Chiang bandit "Pingtung County Council," strongly opposing the Chiang bandit state-run "Tai Sugar Company" seizing their 400 hectares of farmland. They listed the various crimes of the Chiang bandits in oppressing and exploiting Taiwanese farmers and raised the slogan of "not letting our blood and sweat flow in vain" to continue the struggle.

    台湾同胞奋起反抗美蒋统治
    工人、农民、城市贫民和青年学生，不畏强暴，愤怒砸毁美蒋匪帮的军事设施，集体占领蒋匪帮的“官衙”，痛打侵台美军及其走狗，使蒋匪帮狼狈不堪
    据新华社二十四日讯　台湾各地工人、农民、城市贫民和青年学生反对美国侵略者和蒋介石匪帮的斗争，正在日益发展。他们砸毁美蒋匪帮的军事设施，集体占领蒋匪帮的“官衙”，痛打侵台美军及其走狗，使蒋匪帮狼狈不堪。
    据台湾报纸报道，台湾各地最近发生了多起所谓“叛乱案件”。例如：在屏东，台湾同胞砸烂了美蒋匪帮空军的输油管，使高级军用汽油一百二十六桶报废。在台中地区，美蒋匪帮的军用通讯电线曾连续多次遭到严重破坏，有几十里长的电线被剪断。台湾许多地方的军用交通设备也遭到毁坏，“致令不堪使用”。
    台湾报纸还透露，台湾青年失学失业，流离失所的现象十分严重，他们在“无法忍受日积月累的怨恨时，就象河水泛滥或火山爆发一样”，奋起反抗美国侵略者和蒋介石匪帮的罪恶统治。不久前，蒋介石匪帮为了欺骗升学无门、就业无路的台湾青年，装模作样地在台北市搞了一个所谓五年制职业专科学校联合招生报名，但同时对前来报名的青年学生又百般刁难，结果遭到了台湾青年学生的愤怒反抗。据外电报道，七月十二日，大约八千名前来报名的台湾青年，当着“维持秩序”的蒋帮警察的面，把这个报名处的一些办公桌捣成碎块。台湾青年学生愤怒破坏美帝侵台机构，殴打美国侵台军政人员的事件更是经常发生。
    在美国垄断资本和蒋介石匪帮的重重盘剥之下，台湾广大劳动人民被迫在街头巷尾、甚至在垃圾堆上、臭水沟旁搭起不避风雨的破草棚，作为栖身之处。近来，蒋介石卖国集团又以这些贫民窟有碍“观瞻”为名，派出大批拆房队和警察，在各县市强行拆除这些所谓“违章建筑”。台湾同胞奋起反抗蒋匪帮的这一暴行。五月二十九日上午，正当蒋匪帮“台北市议会”举行第五次临时大会开幕“典礼”的时候，台北市中山北路的三十多名“违建”户主愤怒地冲进会场，当面警告蒋匪帮伪“市政府”的头子不得拆除居民们的房子。在高雄市，五月三十一日早晨，五十多名居民冲进蒋匪帮伪“高雄市建设局”，抗议蒋匪帮强拆民房，不顾百姓死活的滔天罪行。愤怒的人们有的把蒋帮官吏揪住不放，要他到街上当众认罪，有的当场捣毁办公室的桌椅，痛打和斥责蒋帮官吏的声音响成一片。当晚进一步占领了伪高雄“市政府”的大厅和楼梯，直到六月一日清晨还没有离去。
    据台湾报纸报道，生活遭到严重威胁的台湾三轮车工人，为反抗蒋匪帮的迫害，也展开了持续的斗争。六月二十日，有一百多名来自台湾各县市的三轮车工人，涌进蒋匪帮伪嘉义“县政府”，抗议蒋匪帮无理取缔三轮车，许多人还怒不可遏地冲上二楼去找伪“县长”算账。据报道，最近，在台湾中部，也有四百多名三轮车工人，为了争取活下去，正在同蒋匪帮进行斗争。
    遭受美蒋匪帮残酷剥削和压迫的台湾农民，以锄头、扁担、粪桶作武器，同美蒋匪帮展开了争夺土地的斗争。据台北市《大华晚报》报道，六月二十一日，屏东地区的一千多名农民再次冲进蒋匪帮“屏东县议会”，强烈反对蒋匪帮官营“台糖公司”强占他们的四百公顷耕地。他们历数了蒋匪帮压迫和剥削台湾农民的种种罪行，提出了“不甘血汗白流”坚持斗争的口号。
