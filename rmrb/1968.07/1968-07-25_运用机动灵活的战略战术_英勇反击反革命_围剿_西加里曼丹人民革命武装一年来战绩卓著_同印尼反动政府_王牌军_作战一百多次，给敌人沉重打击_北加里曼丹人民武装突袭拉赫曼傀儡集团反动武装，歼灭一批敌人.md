The revolutionary armed forces in West Kalimantan have achieved remarkable results in the past year by bravely countering the counter-revolutionary "encirclement and suppression" by the fascist military regime of Suharto and Nasution. Since their successful raid on the airbase at Gunung Api, set up by the Indonesian reactionaries in West Kalimantan, last July, the revolutionary armed forces have engaged in more than a hundred battles with the "elite" forces of the Suharto-Nasution fascist military regime. They have bravely and fearlessly countered the reactionary army's counter-revolutionary "encirclement and suppression," inflicting heavy blows on the invading enemy. In the past two months, they have engaged in a series of new battles with the reactionary army. According to reports, on May 14, in the dense forests of West Kalimantan, the revolutionary armed forces bravely attacked the reactionary army that came to "sweep" the area. On May 30 and June 1, the revolutionary armed forces engaged in multiple fierce battles with the reactionary army. The revolutionary armed forces, using flexible strategies and tactics, have left the reactionary army in disarray. Western news agencies have had to admit that the West Kalimantan guerrilla fighters have "achieved some success" in their struggle against the "encirclement and suppression."

The fascist military regime in Indonesia is extremely anxious about the rapid development of the revolutionary armed forces in West Kalimantan. Since last August, they have repeatedly dispatched 9,000 troops from Java and Sumatra to suppress the area, even colluding with the reactionary military forces of "Malaysia" to carry out a so-called "joint encirclement and suppression" of the revolutionary armed forces in West Kalimantan. This fascist military regime has boasted that they would "eliminate" the revolutionary armed forces in West Kalimantan in just two weeks, and later said they would do so in just half a year. However, all these boasts have been proven false. Now, a year has passed, and the revolutionary armed forces in West Kalimantan, under the harsh conditions of enemy encirclement, stand firm and continue to grow stronger. The Jakarta newspaper "Hope's Light" exclaimed on June 19 that currently, the "guerrilla organization has expanded to East Kalimantan." According to Agence France-Presse, the Indonesian reactionary military authorities recently lamented that their original plan to "eliminate" the revolutionary armed forces in West Kalimantan within a set period of time "cannot be achieved." The Jakarta newspaper "Hope's Light" recently had to admit that the reactionaries' "sweeping" actions against the revolutionary armed forces in West Kalimantan have "not succeeded."

News from Jakarta reveals that the Suharto-Nasution fascist military regime, beset by internal and external troubles, is continuing to send more troops to West Kalimantan in an attempt to further suppress the revolutionary armed forces. However, it has been proven that the revolutionary armed forces in West Kalimantan, supported by the people and brave and skilled in battle, are not intimidated or defeated by any reactionary forces. The revolutionary armed forces in West Kalimantan will certainly overcome all difficulties and continue to advance victoriously.

The revolutionary armed forces in North Kalimantan attacked a reactionary armed force of the "Malaysia" Rahman puppet regime in the Lenak area of Sarawak on July 17, annihilating a batch of enemies. According to Western news agencies, the revolutionary armed forces in North Kalimantan, in this battle, appeared suddenly and unexpectedly, launching a surprise attack on the reactionary army that was setting up an ambush. The enemy was routed, with some killed and others wounded, and some falling into the valley while fleeing in panic. After the battle, the revolutionary armed forces safely withdrew.

    运用机动灵活的战略战术　英勇反击反革命“围剿”
    西加里曼丹人民革命武装一年来战绩卓著
    同印尼反动政府“王牌军”作战一百多次，给敌人沉重打击
    北加里曼丹人民武装突袭拉赫曼傀儡集团反动武装，歼灭一批敌人
    新华社二十四日讯雅加达消息：战斗在印度尼西亚西加里曼丹的人民革命武装力量，一年来英勇反击苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯军队的反革命“围剿”，取得了卓著的战绩。
    西加里曼丹人民革命武装从去年七月成功地奇袭印尼反动派设在西加里曼丹山口洋的空军基地以来，到今年四月，连续同苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯军人政权的“王牌军”作战一百多次，英勇无畏地反击了反动军队的反革命“围剿”，给来犯的敌人以沉重打击。最近两个月来，他们又同反动军队进行了一系列新的战斗。据报道，五月十四日，在西加里曼丹茂密的丛林中，人民武装力量英勇袭击前来“扫荡”的反动军队。五月三十日和六月一日，人民武装又先后同反动军队进行多次激烈战斗。人民武装运用机动灵活的战略战术，把反动军队打得晕头转向。西方通讯社不得不承认，西加里曼丹人民游击战士在反“围剿”斗争中“获得了一些成绩”。
    印尼法西斯军人政权对西加里曼丹人民革命武装的迅速发展，十分恐慌。从去年八月以来，他们先后从爪哇和苏门答腊等地调动九千名兵力前往镇压，甚至勾结“马来西亚”反动军队对西加里曼丹人民武装进行所谓“联合围剿”。这个法西斯军人政权大吹大擂，起初说什么只用两周的时间，后来又说只用半年就可以“消灭”西加里曼丹人民武装力量。但是，敌人的这些叫嚣统统破了产。现在一年已经过去了，西加里曼丹人民武装力量，在敌军围困的险恶环境下，巍然屹立，并且日益发展壮大。雅加达《希望之光报》六月十九日惊呼，目前，西加里曼丹的“游击队的组织已经扩展到东加里曼丹”。据法新社报道，印尼反动军事当局不久以前哀叹，他们原来拟订的定期“消灭”西加里曼丹人民武装力量的狂妄计划“不可能达到”。雅加达《希望之光报》最近也不得不承认，印尼反动派对西加里曼丹人民武装的“扫荡”行动，“没有成功”。
    从雅加达传出的消息透露，内外交困的苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯军人政权正继续向西加里曼丹增兵，企图进一步镇压人民革命武装。但事实证明，得到人民群众拥护、勇敢善战的西加里曼丹人民武装力量是任何反动势力也吓不倒，打不垮的。西加里曼丹人民武装必将战胜各种困难，继续胜利前进。
    新华社二十四日讯古晋消息：北加里曼丹人民武装十七日在沙捞越伦乐地区袭击一支“马来西亚”拉赫曼傀儡集团的反动武装，歼灭了一批敌人。
    据西方通讯社报道，北加里曼丹人民武装在这次战斗中神出鬼没，对正在布置伏击他们的反动军队，进行出其不意的突然袭击，打得敌人狼狈不堪。敌军死的死，伤的伤，有的在仓惶逃窜时跌入了山谷里。人民武装在战斗胜利结束后，已安全地转移。
