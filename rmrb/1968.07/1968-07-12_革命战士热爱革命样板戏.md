Title: Revolutionary Soldiers Love Revolutionary Model Operas

Edition: 3

A new genre of proletarian revolutionary literature—the piano-accompanied singing of "The Red Lantern"—has blossomed like a vibrant red flower, basking in the radiant sunlight of Mao Zedong Thought, in the garden of proletarian revolutionary literature. This is a great victory for Chairman Mao's revolutionary literary line, a brilliant achievement of Comrade Jiang Qing's resolute implementation and courageous defense of Chairman Mao's revolutionary literary line, and a bountiful harvest of the capital's literary warriors' active study and application of Mao Zedong Thought.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Our literature and art belong to the people, first of all to the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and are for them to use." After hearing and seeing the piano-accompanied modern Beijing opera "The Red Lantern" on the radio and television, we cannot contain our joy and shout loudly: "This kind of play is good! Very good!" "Long live revolutionary modern model operas!"

It is good because it has a distinct proletarian political color. On the stage stand the towering figures of our workers, peasants, and soldiers. The lofty qualities of Li Yuhe and Li Tiemei, the father and daughter, who "for the sake of sacrifice have great aspirations, daring to make the sun and moon change to a new sky," will forever inspire and encourage a new generation of communists to hold high the red flag and follow Chairman Mao in revolution for life, unchanging even if the seas dry up and the stones crumble.

It is good because it faithfully implements Chairman Mao's literary policy of "using the past to serve the present, using foreign things to serve China" and "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend." It skillfully "grafts" modern revolutionary Beijing opera with the piano, which is known as the "king of instruments" in the West, to serve our workers, peasants, and soldiers. It has written a brilliant new chapter in the history of human art.

It is good because it has given a resounding slap in the face to those who advocated "universal art" and the "mystery" of opera and music in the 1930s. Its birth has made us understand a truth: proletarian literary warriors armed with Mao Zedong Thought dare to tread paths where no one has gone before, dare to scale peaks where no one has climbed, and can create all kinds of miracles. As long as we liberate our minds, do not believe in "authorities," and dare to declare war on the counter-revolutionary revisionist literary black line, we will surely achieve continuous victories.

It is good because it has greatly boosted the morale of all peace-loving people in the world and greatly dampened the spirits of imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries in various countries. Facts have once again exposed their shameless lies in defaming China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

A thousand praises, ten thousand praises, cannot fully express the deep proletarian feelings of revolutionary soldiers for such a new thing. A thousand good things, ten thousand good things, and one sentence: "Follow Chairman Mao and firmly adhere to Chairman Mao's revolutionary literary line, that is victory."

Chairman Mao teaches us: "In the present world, all culture or literature and art belong to a certain class and a certain political line." Indeed, different people sing different songs, and different classes watch different plays. We proletarian revolutionary soldiers most oppose plays that advocate bourgeois ideology and most love plays that sing the praises of Chairman Mao, Mao Zedong Thought, Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and the heroes of the times. Because such plays perform what is in our hearts, say what is in our minds, and sing what is in our hearts. Such plays are the most combative, the most inspiring, and the most educational.

    革命战士热爱革命样板戏
    解放军某部　红文兵
    无产阶级革命文艺的新品种——钢琴伴唱《红灯记》，犹如一株鲜艳的红花，沐浴着毛泽东思想的灿烂阳光，在无产阶级革命文艺百花园里开放了。这是毛主席革命文艺路线的伟大胜利，是江青同志坚决贯彻和勇敢捍卫毛主席革命文艺路线的又一光辉结晶，是首都文艺战士活学活用毛泽东思想的丰硕成果。
    毛主席教导我们：“我们的文学艺术都是为人民大众的，首先是为工农兵的，为工农兵而创作，为工农兵所利用的。”我们从广播、电视里听到、看到钢琴伴唱现代京剧《红灯记》之后，抑制不住内心的喜悦，大声欢呼：“这样的戏就是好！好得很！”“革命现代样板戏万岁！”
    说它好，就是因为它有鲜明的无产阶级政治色彩，舞台上屹立着我们工农兵的高大形象。李玉和、李铁梅父女俩那种“为有牺牲多壮志，敢教日月换新天”的崇高品质，永远鼓舞和激励一代共产主义新人，高擎红旗，跟毛主席干一辈子革命，海枯石烂不变心。
    说它好，就是因为它忠实地贯彻了毛主席“古为今用，洋为中用”“百花齐放，推陈出新”的文艺方针。它把革命现代京剧同被人称之为西方“乐器之王”的钢琴巧妙地“嫁接”在一块，为我们工农兵服务。在人类文艺史上写下了辉煌灿烂的新篇章。
    说它好，就是因为它给那些鼓吹“全民文艺”和戏曲、音乐“神秘”论的三十年代“权威”“老头子”们一记最响亮的耳光。它的诞生，使我们懂得一条真理：用毛泽东思想武装起来的无产阶级文艺战士，敢于走前人没有走过的道路，敢于攀登前人没有攀登过的高峰，什么人间奇迹都可以创造出来；只要我们解放思想，不迷信“权威”，敢于向反革命的修正主义文艺黑线宣战，我们就一定能不断地取得胜利。
    说它好，就是因为它大长了世界上一切爱好和平人民的志气，大灭了帝国主义、修正主义和各国反动派的威风。事实再次无情地揭穿了他们污蔑中国文化大革命的无耻谎言。
    一千个好，一万个好，无法表达出革命战士对这样一个崭新事物的深厚的无产阶级感情。千好万好并一句：“紧跟毛主席，坚定不移走毛主席的革命文艺路线就是胜利。”
    毛主席教导我们说：“在现在世界上，一切文化或文学艺术都是属于一定的阶级，属于一定的政治路线的。”事实正是这样，什么人唱什么歌，什么阶级看什么戏。我们无产阶级革命战士最反对宣扬资产阶级思想的坏戏，最喜欢歌颂毛主席、歌颂毛泽东思想、歌颂毛主席无产阶级革命路线，歌颂时代英雄的好戏。因为这样的戏演的是我们心中的事，说的是我们心中的话，唱的是我们心中的歌。这样的戏最富有战斗性，最有鼓舞和教育意义。
