After reading the poisonous weed "Storm," we are so furious that our lungs almost burst. It pretends to "reflect agricultural collectivization" but actually cheers for the rightist reactionary line of "left in form, right in essence" advocated by the Chinese Khrushchev. The so-called "socialist education movement" led by Zhu Yongkang in Huangni Township is exactly the same as the "fake Four Cleanups, real restoration" carried out by the wife of Chinese Khrushchev, Wang XX, in our Peach Garden.

In the draft decision on "Some Current Problems in Rural Work" personally drafted by Chairman Mao, it is clearly stated: "This movement must have strong leadership, rely on the organization of poor and lower-middle peasants, conduct thorough investigations and research among the masses, and mobilize the masses."

However, the Chinese Khrushchev blathers about how "the poor and lower-middle peasants do not tell us the truth," how "in many cases, the method of holding investigation meetings is no longer effective... investigation meetings cannot uncover problems," and how "after the work team enters the village, some secret work must be done, only by infiltrating and connecting, they will not be afraid to speak."

Is it about mobilizing the masses or "infiltrating and connecting"? Is it about investigation and research or "secret work"? These are two fundamentally opposed attitudes towards the people, and two completely different methods of conducting the socialist education movement.

What is the "socialist education movement" in "Storm" like?

Flipping through the book, on the first day of his assignment, the second secretary of the district committee, Zhu Yongkang, goes out at night for private inspections and secret investigations, "infiltrating and connecting." What is this "encountering Wan Chunfang" and "night visit to He Laojiu," and "three invitations to Lu Suyun"? A bunch of "secret work." He uses the experience of "fighting guerrilla warfare during the anti-Japanese period," without conducting investigations and research, and based on a pile of weeds, he "determines the class background" and selects the "roots," making friends with He Laojiu.

Zhu Yongkang's tricks are the same as those used by the wife of Chinese Khrushchev, Wang XX, in our Peach Garden. Wang XX came to Peach Garden, wearing a large mask and wrapping a large headscarf, conducting private inspections and secret meetings, sneaking around, and engaging in all sorts of underhanded "secret activities." Whether it is Wang XX or Zhu Yongkang, they are of the same ilk.

Wang XX and Zhu Yongkang, both of them, are wholesale products from Chinese Khrushchev.

The Chinese Khrushchev sees the socialist new countryside as "a mess of black," claiming that our countryside is an "enemy-occupied area" and boasting about "reopening the base area." Therefore, he brings out a set of "white area work experience," engaging in all sorts of "infiltrating and connecting" and "secret work."

The counter-revolutionary Chen Dengke is a mere echo of the Chinese Khrushchev. In his black book "Storm," he portrays the socialist countryside as a world of "misery and desolation." Here, the poor and lower-middle peasants are selfish and backward, longing for individual farming and unwilling to take the socialist path. Here, the grassroots government deceives superiors and subordinates, pays lip service but acts otherwise, and the Party's policies are like "water flowing down from upstream," reaching here, they are "blocked by the dam" and cannot be implemented. The novel begins with a woman surnamed Yang setting up a dog meat stall in a small town in the Huaibei Plain, attracting customers. This implies that the grassroots government here is a counter-revolutionary dual government of "hanging a sheep's head but selling dog meat." Chen Dengke, following behind the Chinese Khrushchev, maliciously slanders our poor and lower-middle peasants and fiercely attacks our proletarian dictatorship, fully exposing this fellow's counter-revolutionary face.

As soon as Zhu Yongkang arrives in the "extremely backward" Huangni Township, he keeps talking about "rebuilding the stove." What "stove" does Zhu Yongkang want to "rebuild"? Just look at what "roots" he has "infiltrated" and what people he has "connected" in Huangni Township, and it will be clear.

The so-called old poor peasant He Laojiu is a grumpy old drunk who is full of complaints about socialist reality; the only "good cadre" in Zhu Yongkang's eyes, Ren Weiqun, is a former township militia battalion commander who has been removed from office and is full of resentment towards the Party; Ren Weiqun's wife, Lu Suyun, is indignant and "unjust" towards the Party because her husband has been removed from office... The common characteristic of these people is that they have "grievances," "resentment," and "unjust feelings" towards the Party and socialism.

After Zhu Yongkang "infiltrates" these "roots" and "connects" these people, he indeed hears the "truth" that the Chinese Khrushchev wants to hear. What is this "Huangni Township suffers disasters every year and is flooded every year," "bad people are in charge, good people are beaten," "since liberation, they have not turned over yet," and so on? These are clearly the black words of the Chinese Khrushchev and his gang attacking the Party, attacking socialism, and attacking the Three Red Banners.

Zhu Yongkang gathers these people together, "infiltrating" and "connecting" them, to do what? They spread the wind of individual farming and the wind of reversing cases, attempting to "rebuild" the black "stove" of capitalism.

The set described in "Storm" is exactly what was peddled from Wang XX. The Chinese Khrushchev and his wife Wang XX treated our Peach Garden as an experimental field for restoring capitalism, staging a farce of "fake Four Cleanups, real restoration."

She wields the big stick of suppressing the masses, striking down the Party and government organizations of Peach Garden as "counter-revolutionary dual governments," targeting good and relatively good cadres. The Party branch secretary, Wu Chen, was labeled a bad element, and the deputy branch secretary, Zhao Shuzhen, was driven to his deathbed.

Through "infiltrating and connecting," she dresses up the bad elements as "active elements" and "good cadres," promoting the bad elements to the stage, seizing the Party and government power of Peach Garden.

Thinking of Peach Garden and looking at "Storm," we feel how profound Chairman Mao's teachings are! He said: "The imperialists and domestic reactionaries will not readily accept their defeat. They will make their last struggle. After the country is pacified, they will still engage in sabotage and disruption in various ways. They will try to restore their power in China every day and every moment." The Chinese Khrushchev and his agents are a group of representatives of the Kuomintang reactionaries who "try to restore their power in China every day and every moment." They write black novels, conduct fake Four Cleanups, and use every means to overthrow our proletarian regime.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao, has completely shattered their sweet dreams. We poor and lower-middle peasants are all jubilant. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres in Peach Garden will definitely follow Chairman Mao's great teachings, carry out a thorough criticism and repudiation of the Chinese Khrushchev's counter-revolutionary revisionist line, thoroughly criticize and repudiate the reactionary novel "Storm," further eliminate the poison of Wang XX, "grasp revolution and promote production," and turn Peach Garden into a bright red school of Mao Zedong Thought.

    从桃园看反动小说《风雷》
    河北省抚宁县卢王庄公社桃园大队　冯爱中　袁秀英　赵秀珍
    看了《风雷》这株大毒草，把我们的肺都快气炸了。它打着“反映农业合作化”的幌子，为中国赫鲁晓夫形“左”实右的资产阶级反动路线摇旗呐喊。祝永康在黄泥乡搞的所谓“社会主义教育运动”，和中国赫鲁晓夫的老婆王××在我们桃园搞的“假四清，真复辟”完全是一个模样。
    毛主席亲自主持制定的《中共中央关于目前农村工作中若干问题的决定（草案）》中明确指出：“这次运动要有坚强的领导，要依靠贫下中农组织，要在群众中做好调查研究，要放手发动群众。”
    中国赫鲁晓夫却胡说什么“贫下中农不向我们说真话”，“用开调查会的办法在很多情况下是不行了……调查会调查不出问题来”，“工作队进村以后，要进行一些秘密工作，只有扎根串连，他们不怕了，才能讲话”。
    是发动群众还是“扎根串连”？是调查研究还是“秘密工作”？这是对待人民群众两种根本对立的态度，这是开展社会主义教育运动两种完全不同的方法。
    《风雷》里的“社会主义教育运动”，到底是咋搞的呢？
    翻开书看看，区委第二书记祝永康上任第一天，就深夜出游，私察暗访，“扎根串连”。什么“路遇万春芳”呀，什么“夜访何老九”呀，什么“三请陆素云”呀，一大堆的“秘密工作”。他拿出“抗日时期打游击的经验”，不进行调查研究，单凭一堆荒草，就“判定成份”，选定“根子”，结识了何老九。
    祝永康这套鬼办法，就是中国赫鲁晓夫的老婆王××在我们桃园搞的那一套。王××到桃园来，捂个大口罩，包个大头巾，私察暗访，开会放哨，鬼鬼祟祟，大搞见不得人的“神秘活动”。一个王××，一个祝永康，完全是一路货。
    王××也罢，祝永康也罢，他们所搞的这一套都是从中国赫鲁晓夫那里批发来的。
    中国赫鲁晓夫把社会主义新农村看得“一团漆黑”，胡说什么我们的农村是“敌占区”，扬言要“重新开辟根据地”。因此，他就搬出一套“白区工作经验”，大搞什么“扎根串连”，“秘密工作”。
    反革命分子陈登科，完全是中国赫鲁晓夫的应声虫。在他的黑书《风雷》里，把社会主义农村写成个“困苦凄凉”的世界。这里的贫下中农自私落后，迷恋单干，不愿走社会主义道路。这里的基层政权，欺上瞒下，阳奉阴违，党的政策就象“上游流下来的水”，到了这里“就被坝子挡住”，再也贯彻不下去了。小说开始就写在淮北平原的小集镇上，有个姓羊的女人摆了个狗肉摊，在那里招引顾客。这就暗示：这里的基层政权都是“挂羊头、卖狗肉”的反革命两面政权。陈登科跟在中国赫鲁晓夫的屁股后面，这样恶毒地污蔑我们贫下中农，疯狂地攻击我们的无产阶级专政，这就充分暴露了这个家伙的反革命嘴脸。
    祝永康一到“极端落后”的黄泥乡，就口口声声要“重砌灶锅”。祝永康究竟要“重砌”什么“灶锅”？只要看看他在黄泥乡“扎”了什么根，“串”了什么人，就一清二楚了。
    顶着老贫农招牌的何老九，是个对社会主义现实“一肚闷气”、“满腹牢骚”的老酒鬼；祝永康眼里唯一的“好干部”任为群，是个被罢了官的乡民兵大队长，他对党心怀不满，怨气冲天；任为群的老婆陆素云，由于丈夫被罢官而对党愤愤“不平”……。这些人的共同特点就是对党、对社会主义有“闷气”，有“冤气”，有“不平”。
    祝永康在“扎”了这些“根”，“串”了这些人以后，也果然听到了中国赫鲁晓夫要听的那种“真话”。什么黄泥乡“年年遭灾，岁岁被淹”，什么“坏人当道，好人被打”，什么“解放以来，还没有翻过身来”等等，分明都是中国赫鲁晓夫及其一伙攻击党，攻击社会主义，攻击三面红旗的黑话。
    祝永康把这些人“扎”在一块，“串”在一起，干什么呢？他们大刮单干风，大刮翻案风，妄图“重砌”资本主义的黑“灶锅”。
    《风雷》里所写的这一套正是从王××那里贩卖来的。中国赫鲁晓夫和他的老婆王××把我们桃园当作复辟资本主义的试验田，演出了一场“假四清，真复辟”的丑剧。
    她挥舞镇压群众的大棒，一棒把桃园党政组织打成“反革命两面政权”，矛头指向好的和比较好的干部。党支部书记吴臣被戴上坏分子的帽子，支部副书记赵树椿被活活逼死在病床。
    她通过“扎根串连”，把坏分子打扮成“积极分子”、“好干部”，扶植坏人登台，把持了桃园的党政大权。
    想想桃园，看看《风雷》，使我们感到毛主席的教导是多么深刻！他老人家说：“帝国主义者和国内反动派决不甘心于他们的失败，他们还要作最后的挣扎。在全国平定以后，他们也还会以各种方式从事破坏和捣乱，他们将每日每时企图在中国复辟。”中国赫鲁晓夫和他的代理人，就是一群代表国民党反动派、“每日每时企图在中国复辟”的反革命。他们写黑小说，搞假四清，千方百计要颠覆我们的无产阶级政权。
    伟大领袖毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命，彻底摧毁了他们的黄粱美梦，我们贫下中农无不欢欣鼓舞。我们桃园的广大贫下中农和无产阶级革命派，一定遵照毛主席的伟大教导，开展革命的大批判，批臭中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义路线，批臭反动小说《风雷》，进一步肃清王××的毒害，“抓革命，促生产”，把桃园办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校。
