The Revolutionary Committee and the Military Training Team of Zhangjiakou Third Middle School began holding various forms of Mao Zedong Thought study classes on May 12th among the graduating students who were supposed to be assigned. They targeted the active thoughts among the students, actively learned and applied Chairman Mao's brilliant works, carried out revolutionary criticism, helped them raise their awareness of the struggle between the two lines, and encouraged them to resolutely go to the vast countryside. The following three short stories vividly illustrate that mobilizing students to go to the countryside is a class struggle. The leadership must stand at the height of the struggle between the two classes and the two lines, and carry out in-depth and detailed ideological and political work to successfully complete this glorious task. — Editor

The news that Li Zhibin, a member of the school's Revolutionary Committee, was approved to be the first batch to settle in Hebei's Shanhaiguan, immediately caused a sensation in the entire class. Classmates congratulated him one after another and expressed their desire to learn from him. However, two classmates said to him, "In school, you are a committee member; in the countryside, you will definitely still be a cadre." Li Zhibin, who comes from a poor peasant family and has grown up during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, immediately felt that these two classmates' understanding was wrong and that there must be something behind it. Upon investigation, it turned out that class enemies had spread rumors.

Just as classmates were congratulating him, he and his classmates organized a study class titled "Never Forget Class Struggle." He led everyone to use Chairman Mao's statements on class struggle as a weapon, to use the class enemies' rumors as live materials, and to launch a special criticism of China's Khrushchev's fallacies such as "study to become an official" and "go to the countryside to gain experience." Li Zhibin spoke first, saying, "The class enemies' claim that a committee member will still be a cadre in the countryside is the same as China's Khrushchev's 'promotion and wealth' junk, attempting to make us become bourgeois officials detached from workers and peasants, and become their successors. Chairman Mao teaches us: 'We Communists are not seeking office, but revolution.' The value of a Revolutionary Committee member lies in the word 'revolution.' There must not be any special privileges. After going to the countryside, I will definitely stick with the poor and lower-middle peasants, sweat together, and take root together." The classmates then spoke one after another, eagerly criticizing. The two classmates who originally thought Li Zhibin would still be a cadre in the countryside recognized the class enemies' counter-revolutionary faces and their own ideological errors through exposure and criticism, and actively participated in the criticism. One of the classmates said, "I have decided to follow the path of combining with workers and peasants as indicated by Chairman Mao!"

Through this lively class struggle education, the classmates' awareness of the struggle between the two lines was further raised. Everyone expressed their determination to learn from Li Zhibin and go to where the motherland needs them the most, to be the people's ox for life, and to pull the revolutionary cart for life.

    贵在“革命”二字
    张家口第三中学的革委会和军训团，从五月十二日开始，在应该分配的毕业生中，大办各种形式的毛泽东思想学习班，针对学生中存在的活思想，活学活用毛主席的光辉著作，开展革命的大批判，帮助他们提高两条路线斗争的觉悟，鼓励他们坚决地到农村广阔的天地里去。下面三个小故事，生动地说明了，动员学生上山下乡，是一场阶级斗争，领导上必须站在两个阶级、两条路线斗争的高度，进行深入细致的思想政治工作，才能胜利地完成这项光荣任务。——编者
    校革委会委员李志宾同学被批准第一批去河北坝上落户的消息一传开，立即轰动了全班，同学们纷纷向他祝贺，表示要向他学习。谁知有两个同学却对他说：“在学校你是委员，到农村保准还是干部。”李志宾，这个出身贫农家庭，在无产阶级文化大革命中成长起来的革命小将，立即觉得这两个同学的认识不对头，里面一定有文章。一追根究底，原来是阶级敌人散布了流言蜚语。
    就在同学们向他祝贺的时候，他和同学们一起办起了“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”学习班。他带领大家以毛主席有关阶级斗争的论述为武器，把阶级敌人的流言蜚语当活材料，对中国赫鲁晓夫“读书做官”“下乡镀金”等谬论展开了专题批判。李志宾首先发言说：“阶级敌人散布的委员到农村准还当干部，就是中国赫鲁晓夫叫卖的‘升官发财’的破烂货，妄图叫我们变成脱离工农的资产阶级官老爷，成为他们的接班人。毛主席教导我们：‘我们共产党人不是要做官，而是要革命’，革委会委员就是贵在‘革命’二字上，决不能有任何丝毫的特殊。到农村后，我一定和贫下中农心贴在一起，汗流在一块，根扎在一起。”接着同学们争着发言，抢着批判，原来认为李志宾到农村准当干部的那两个同学，在揭发批判中，认清了阶级敌人的反革命嘴脸，认识了自己思想上的错误，也积极参加了批判。其中一个同学说：“毛主席指引的与工农相结合的道路，我是走定了！”
    通过这一堂生动的阶级斗争教育课，进一步提高了同学们的两条路线斗争觉悟，大家表示：一定要向李志宾同学学习，到祖国最需要的地方去，当一辈子人民的牛，拉一辈子革命的车。
