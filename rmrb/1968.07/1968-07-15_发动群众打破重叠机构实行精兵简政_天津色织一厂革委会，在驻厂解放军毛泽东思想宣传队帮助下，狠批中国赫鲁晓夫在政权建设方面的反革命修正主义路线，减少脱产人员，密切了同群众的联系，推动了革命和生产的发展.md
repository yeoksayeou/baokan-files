The Tianjin Dyeing and Weaving Factory Revolutionary Committee, with the help of the People's Liberation Army Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team stationed at the factory, launched a fierce criticism of the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of the Chinese Khrushchev in the construction of political power. They reduced the number of full-time personnel, strengthened their ties with the masses, and promoted the development of the revolution and production.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, July 14 — Chairman Mao teaches us: "The revolutionary committees should implement unified leadership, break down the overlapping administrative structures, streamline and reduce personnel, and organize a revolutionary leadership team that is connected with the masses." The People's Liberation Army Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team stationed at the Tianjin Dyeing and Weaving Factory, following Chairman Mao's instructions, helped the factory's revolutionary committee to mobilize the masses, launch a fierce criticism of the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of the Chinese Khrushchev, resolutely implement Chairman Mao's great directive on "streamlining and reducing personnel," break down the overlapping administrative structures, reduce the number of full-time personnel, and make the newly established revolutionary committee further strengthen its ties with the masses, better play the role of a battle command center, and promote the revolutionary and production situation in the entire factory to become better and better.

To implement streamlining and reducing personnel, the first step is to focus on revolutionary criticism.

The Tianjin Dyeing and Weaving Factory is a medium-sized factory with over 600 workers. Before the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, due to the frenzied promotion of the counter-revolutionary revisionist line by the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Tianjin, the factory was divided into three levels of management: factory, section, and workshop, with 56 full-time cadres, resulting in a bloated structure and idle personnel. During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the revolutionary masses in the factory seized power from a handful of capitalist roaders within the party. In January of this year, in the early days of the establishment of the revolutionary committee, revolutionary workers proposed: "We need to reform the old structure and not follow the old path." The revolutionary committee conducted multiple discussions and began the work of structural reform. However, after a period of time, the results were not significant. What was the problem? The comrades from the People's Liberation Army Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team stationed at the factory, after research, believed that the key lay in the fact that the members of the revolutionary committee were still constrained by old ideas and old frameworks. To implement streamlining and reducing personnel and break down the overlapping administrative structures, it was necessary to thoroughly criticize the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of the Chinese Khrushchev in the construction of political power with Mao Zedong Thought, and raise the awareness of the revolutionary committee members on streamlining and reducing personnel. Therefore, they and the members of the revolutionary committee together studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions and the teachings of "without destruction, there can be no construction. Destruction is criticism, it is revolution," guiding everyone to realize that only by fully mobilizing the masses, carrying out revolutionary criticism, and eliminating the harmful influences of the counter-revolutionary revisionist line promoted by the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Tianjin, could streamlining and reducing personnel be achieved.

With heightened awareness, the comrades from the propaganda team and the members of the revolutionary committee went to the masses, mobilizing the broad revolutionary workers to launch revolutionary criticism. In the course of the criticism, the broad revolutionary workers actively applied Mao Zedong Thought, using a large amount of facts to fiercely expose and criticize the crimes of the Chinese Khrushchev in promoting the counter-revolutionary revisionist line in the construction of political power, listing a series of drawbacks of the old structure such as having too many full-time personnel, overlapping and bloated structures, and detachment from the masses, pointing out that the Chinese Khrushchev's promotion of this line was an attempt to change socialism into capitalism and proletarian dictatorship into bourgeois dictatorship. The revolutionary criticism deeply educated the members of the revolutionary committee, making them realize that streamlining and reducing personnel, achieving the revolutionization of the leadership team, was of great significance for implementing Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and consolidating the proletarian dictatorship. They resolved to follow Chairman Mao's instructions on "streamlining and reducing personnel" and build the revolutionary committee into a revolutionary leadership team that is connected with the masses.

To implement streamlining and reducing personnel, it is necessary to fully mobilize and rely on the masses.

After the revolutionary criticism, both the broad revolutionary workers and the members of the revolutionary committee had a strong desire and demand for streamlining and reducing personnel and achieving the revolutionization of the leadership team. However, how to proceed? The comrades from the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team and the members of the revolutionary committee again studied Chairman Mao's teachings: "All correct leadership must come from the masses and go to the masses." "From the masses, concentrate; to the masses, persevere, to form correct leadership opinions, this is the basic method of leadership." Through the study, everyone realized that while thoroughly criticizing the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of the Chinese Khrushchev, it was necessary to discuss with the masses how to implement streamlining and reducing personnel. They said: the masses have the right to speak, the masses know best how to do it, only by mobilizing the masses, relying on the masses, coming from the masses and going to the masses, could the work of streamlining and reducing personnel be done solidly, quickly, and well.

The comrades from the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team and the members of the revolutionary committee again went deep into the masses, studying with everyone Chairman Mao's latest instructions: "The revolutionary committees should implement unified leadership, break down the overlapping administrative structures, streamlining and reduce personnel, and organize a revolutionary leadership team that is connected with the masses." They discussed the significance, analyzed the situation, and proposed rational suggestions.

After fully democratic discussion, the revolutionary committee decided, based on the opinions of the masses, to abolish the original seven sections and establish three groups under the revolutionary committee: political work, production, and logistics. At the grassroots level in the workshops and production teams, three-in-one leading groups composed of revolutionary cadres, militia representatives, and revolutionary worker representatives were established to lead the masses in carrying out the revolution and promoting production without being detached from work. In this way, the number of full-time personnel in the factory was greatly reduced, and most of the cadres went down to the production front line. Originally, due to the shortage of labor, 24 machines in this factory were idle. After the cadres went down to the production front line, all 24 idle machines were put into operation, and the daily output immediately increased by more than 11%. The broad revolutionary workers and revolutionary cadres praised: "This time, the structural reform really hit the mark."

After implementing streamlining and reducing personnel, the comrades from the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team and the members of the revolutionary committee reviewed Chairman Mao's teachings: "The reform of state organs, the most fundamental thing, is to connect with the masses." This made everyone realize that the members of the revolutionary committee and the staff must often participate in labor, blend in with the masses, and deeply root themselves among the masses, in order to fully play the role of the revolutionary battle command center of the revolutionary committee, and to fully demonstrate the superiority of the new organizational structure in connecting with the masses. After study and discussion, the factory revolutionary committee formulated five systems for achieving the ideological revolutionization of the leadership team: First, insist on the "daily reading" system. No matter how busy the work is, the tasks are tight, the daily study of Chairman Mao's works is unshakable, and the method of studying and exposing personal and private matters together with the workers in the workshops and teams is adopted to promote ideological revolutionization. Second, except for retaining the necessary personnel to maintain daily work, the members of the revolutionary committee and the staff must insist on spending two-thirds of their time each week in the workshops, working with the workers, and gradually achieving semi-detachment or non-detachment. Third, hold a life meeting every week to carry out criticism and self-criticism. Fourth, oppose special treatment and achieve three changes and three unchanges. That is: the position has changed, but the thought of serving the people wholeheartedly cannot change; the work location has changed, but the style of connecting with the masses cannot change; the job has changed, but the essence of a common laborer cannot change. Fifth, accept the supervision of the masses and regularly open the door for rectification. The new leadership team also implemented a system of standing committee on duty. In addition to one person on duty each day, the standing committee members all went deep into the workshops, worked with the workers, found problems and discussed with the masses, and solved them on the spot. The former factory director and current chairman of the revolutionary committee, Cui Zhiqu, used to be detached from the masses and rarely contacted the workers. Now he follows Chairman Mao's teaching of "being an official and a commoner at the same time," going deep into the teams and working with the workers to study, work, and carry out revolutionary criticism, blending in with the masses. The workers excitedly said: "The more oil and dirt the workers have on their bodies, the more the chairman has on his body. The chairman rests less, worries more, and his sweat and heart are truly with ours." The members of the revolutionary committee also tasted the sweetness of streamlining and reducing personnel and closely connecting with the masses in practice. They resolved to firmly rely on the masses, not to be detached from the masses for a moment, and to better lead the masses forward.

    发动群众打破重叠机构实行精兵简政
    天津色织一厂革委会，在驻厂解放军毛泽东思想宣传队帮助下，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫在政权建设方面的反革命修正主义路线，减少脱产人员，密切了同群众的联系，推动了革命和生产的发展
    据新华社天津十四日电　毛主席教导我们：“革命委员会要实行一元化的领导，打破重叠的行政机构，精兵简政，组织起一个革命化的联系群众的领导班子。”人民解放军驻天津色织一厂毛泽东思想宣传队遵照毛主席的教导，帮助厂革委会放手发动群众，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义路线，坚决贯彻毛主席关于“精兵简政”的伟大指示，打破重叠的行政机构，减少脱产的工作人员，使新生的革委会进一步密切了同群众的联系，更好地发挥了战斗指挥部的作用，推动了全厂的革命和生产形势越来越好。
    实行精兵简政，首先要抓好革命大批判
    天津色织一厂是一个有六百多名工人的中型工厂。无产阶级文化大革命以前，由于中国赫鲁晓夫及其在天津的代理人疯狂推行反革命修正主义路线，这个厂搞成厂、股、车间三级管理，脱产干部达五十六名，造成机构庞大，人浮于事。无产阶级文化大革命中，厂里的无产阶级革命派夺了党内一小撮走资派的权。今年一月，厂革委会成立初期，革命职工就提出：
  “要改革旧机构，不要走老路。”革委会进行了多次研究，也着手了机构改革的工作。但是，搞了一段时间，成效不大。问题在那里？驻厂人民解放军毛泽东思想宣传队的同志经过研究，认为关键在于革委会成员还受着旧思想、旧框框的束缚，要搞好精兵简政，打破重叠的行政机构，必须用毛泽东思想彻底批判中国赫鲁晓夫在政权建设方面所推行的反革命修正主义路线，提高革委会成员对精兵简政的认识。于是他们和革委会成员一起学习了毛主席的最新指示和“不破不立。破，就是批判，就是革命”的教导，引导大家认识到：只有充分发动群众，搞好革命大批判，肃清中国赫鲁晓夫及其在天津代理人所推行的反革命修正主义路线的流毒，才能搞好精兵简政。
    认识提高了，宣传队的同志和革委会成员一起到群众中去，发动广大革命职工开展革命大批判。在大批判中，广大革命职工活学活用毛泽东思想，用大量事实狠揭狠批中国赫鲁晓夫在政权建设方面推行反革命修正主义路线的罪恶，列举了旧机构脱产人员多，机构重叠、庞大，脱离群众等一系列的坏处，指出：中国赫鲁晓夫搞这一套，就是妄图变社会主义为资本主义，变无产阶级专政为资产阶级专政。革命大批判，使革委会成员受到深刻的教育，认识到：精兵简政，实现领导班子革命化，对于贯彻执行毛主席的革命路线，巩固无产阶级专政，有重大的意义。决心遵照毛主席关于“精兵简政”的教导，把革委会建设成革命化的联系群众的领导班子。
    实行精兵简政，必须充分发动群众依靠群众
    经过革命大批判，广大革命职工和革委会成员都有了精兵简政，实行领导班子革命化的强烈愿望和要求。但是，怎样着手实行呢？毛泽东思想宣传队的同志又和革委会成员一起学习毛主席的教导：“凡属正确的领导，必须是从群众中来，到群众中去。”“从群众中集中起来又到群众中坚持下去，以形成正确的领导意见，这是基本的领导方法。”经过学习，大家认识到，在彻底批判中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义路线的同时，必须把如何实行精兵简政交给群众讨论。他们说：群众最有发言权，群众最知道怎么办，只有发动群众，依靠群众，从群众中来，到群众中去，才能把精兵简政的工作做得扎扎实实，又快又好。
    毛泽东思想宣传队的同志和革委会成员又深入到群众之中，和大家一起反复学习毛主席的最新指示：“革命委员会要实行一元化的领导，打破重叠的行政机构，精兵简政，组织起一个革命化的联系群众的领导班子。”一起谈意义，摆情况，提合理化建议。
    经过充分发扬民主，革委会根据群众意见，决定撤掉原来的七个股，在革委会下成立政工、生产、后勤三个组。在基层车间和生产班组，成立了由革命干部、民兵代表、革命职工代表组成的三结合的领导小组，不脱产地领导大家抓革命、促生产。这样，厂里的脱产人员大大减少，大部分干部下到车间生产第一线。原来这个厂由于劳动力紧张，有二十四台车停产，干部下到了生产第一线，停产的二十四台车全开了，日产量立即提高了百分之十一以上。广大革命职工、革命干部称赞说：“这回机构改革真是一竿子插到了底。”
      实行精兵简政，密切联系群众
  新的组织机构成立了，毛泽东思想宣传队的同志又和革委会成员重温毛主席的教导：“国家机关的改革，最根本的一条，就是联系群众。”使大家认识到，革委会成员和工作人员必须经常参加劳动，和群众打成一片，深深扎根于群众之中，才能充分发挥革委会的革命战斗指挥部的作用，才能充分显示新的组织机构联系群众的优越性。经过学习、讨论，厂革委会订出了一个关于实现领导班子思想革命化的五条制度：一、坚持“天天读”制度。事情再多，任务再紧，天天学毛主席著作雷打不动，并采取同车间、班组的工人一起学习，一起亮私、斗私的办法，促进思想革命化。二、除留必要的人员坚持日常工作外，革委会成员和工作人员每周都要坚持三分之二的时间下到车间，同职工一起劳动，逐步做到半脱产或不脱产。三、每周召开一次生活会，开展批评和自我批评。四、反对特殊化，做到三变三不变。即：地位变了，全心全意为人民服务的思想不能变；工作地点变了，联系群众的作风不能变；职务变了，普通劳动者的本色不能变。五、接受群众监督，定期开门整风。新的领导班子还实行了常委值班制，常委除每天一人值班外，都深入到车间，同职工一起劳动，发现问题同群众一起商量，就地解决。原厂长、现革委会主任崔志秋，过去脱离群众，很少接触工人。现在他遵循毛主席“既当‘官’，又当老百姓”的教导，深入班组和职工一起学习、一起劳动、一起搞革命大批判，和群众打成了一片。工人激动地说：“工人身上有多少油泥，主任身上就有多少油泥，主任比我们休息少，操心多，和我们真是汗流在一处，心贴在一起。”革委会成员在实践中也尝到了精兵简政，紧密联系群众的甜头。他们决心坚决地依靠群众，一时一刻也不脱离群众，更好地带领群众前进。
