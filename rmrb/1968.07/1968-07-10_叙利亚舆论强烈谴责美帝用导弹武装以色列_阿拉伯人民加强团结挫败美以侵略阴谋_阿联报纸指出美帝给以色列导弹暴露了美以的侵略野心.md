The U.S. imperialists' decision to provide "Hawk" missiles to their tool of aggression, Israel, has sparked strong condemnation from the public opinion in the United Arab Republic and Syria.

On July 7, the Damascus radio station broadcast a commentary on this issue, stating that the U.S. imperialists and Israeli Zionists are turning their base in Israel into an arsenal to suppress the just struggle of the Palestinian people. "The 'Hawk' missiles and other weapons recently provided and prepared to be provided by the U.S. to Israel are merely proof that the aggressors are at a loss in the face of the armed struggle of the Palestinian people."

The commentary said that the people will not be intimidated by the arrogant posture of the imperialists and Zionists, nor will they be deceived by their "peace" slogans.

The commentary pointed out that the aggression launched by the U.S. and Israel against the Arab countries last June not only failed to suppress the Arab national liberation movement but, on the contrary, awakened the Arab people further and launched an armed struggle against imperialism. The commentary concluded: "Facing the various plots of the U.S. and Israel, we Arab people should strengthen our unity to frustrate their plots and achieve final victory."

The Syrian newspaper *Al-Ba'ath* also published a commentary on July 8, condemning the U.S. imperialists' crimes of suppressing the world's national liberation movements. The commentary pointed out that the United States and its accomplices will not succeed in stopping the increasingly powerful national liberation movement, and it will face the fatal blow of the increasingly awakened people.

The UAR's *Al-Ahram* newspaper's editorial on July 8 stated that the fact that the United States provided missiles to Israel shows that "the United States is determined to pursue a policy of arming Israel and supporting Israel's maintenance of its position of aggression."

The newspaper pointed out that since the June War last year, the United States has continuously provided Israel with large quantities of weapons. Now, it is providing "Hawk" missiles to Israel. This exposes the ambitions of the United States and Israel, which is a challenge to world public opinion.

The editorial of the *Egyptian Gazette* pointed out that no matter how the U.S. Department of Defense tries to justify the provision of missiles to Israel, "it cannot cover up the fact that the United States supports aggression in the Middle East."

    叙利亚舆论强烈谴责美帝用导弹武装以色列
    阿拉伯人民加强团结挫败美以侵略阴谋
    阿联报纸指出美帝给以色列导弹暴露了美以的侵略野心
    新华社九日讯　美帝国主义向它的侵略工具以色列提供“隼式”导弹的决定，激起了阿联和叙利亚舆论的强烈谴责。
    七日晚大马士革电台就这件事发表评论指出，美帝国主义和以色列犹太复国主义把它们的基地以色列变成为一个武器库，是为了对付巴勒斯坦人民的正义斗争。“最近美帝向以色列提供和准备提供的
  ‘隼式’导弹和其他武器，只不过是侵略者在巴勒斯坦人民武装斗争面前一筹莫展的证明”。
    评论说，人民决不会被帝国主义者和犹太复国主义者的嚣张气焰所吓倒，也不会被它的“和平”口号所欺骗。
    评论指出，美以去年六月对阿拉伯国家发动的侵略战争，不仅没能镇压了阿拉伯的民族解放运动，相反地，促使了阿拉伯人民进一步觉悟并展开了反对帝国主义的武装斗争。评论最后说：“我们阿拉伯人民面对着美以的种种阴谋，应该加强团结，以便挫败它们的阴谋，取得最后胜利。”
    叙利亚的《复兴报》八日也发表评论，谴责美帝国主义镇压世界民族解放运动的罪行。评论指出，美国及其帮凶想要阻止日益壮大的民族解放运动是不会得逞的，它将遭到日益提高了觉悟的人民的致命打击。
    阿联《金字塔报》八日的社论说，美国向以色列提供导弹这一事实说明，“美国决心奉行武装以色列和支持以色列维持侵略地位的政策”。
    这家报纸指出，自去年六月战争以来，美国不断向以色列提供大批武器。现在又向以色列提供
  “隼式”导弹。这暴露了美国和以色列的野心，这是对世界舆论的挑战。
      《埃及新闻报》的社论指出，美国国防部不管如何为向以色列提供导弹一事辩解，“都掩盖不了美国支持在中东的侵略的事实。”
