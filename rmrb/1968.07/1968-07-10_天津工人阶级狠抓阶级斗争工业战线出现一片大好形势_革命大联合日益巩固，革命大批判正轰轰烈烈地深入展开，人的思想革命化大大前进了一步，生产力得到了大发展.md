Tianjin's working class is holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, taking class struggle as the key link, and steadfastly implementing the great directive of the great leader Chairman Mao, "grasp revolution, promote production." This has resulted in a great leap forward in both revolution and production on the industrial front. Currently, revolutionary unity is increasingly consolidated on Tianjin's industrial front, revolutionary committees have become stronger through the storms of class struggle, revolutionary big-character posters are being widely put up, people's ideological revolutionization has made great progress, and productivity has been greatly enhanced. In recent months, industrial production in the entire city has surged.

The latest information provided by relevant departments of the Tianjin Revolutionary Committee indicates that this great leap forward has appeared in most industries, including textiles, light industry, transportation, machinery, metallurgy, chemicals, building materials, and basic construction. Among the 144 major products listed in the national plan, 77% saw an increase in production in June compared to May. Among these, the production of steel, diesel engines, gear-cutting machine tools, lifting equipment, industrial water pumps, caustic soda, soda ash, fertilizers, automobile tires, rubber shoes, cement, cotton yarn, cotton cloth, burlap, knitted cotton products, bicycles, watches, daily-use aluminum products, and plastic shoes all saw significant increases. Many factories have also achieved outstanding results in creating new technologies, developing new products, and saving coal and raw materials.

In the first half of this year, many factories and enterprises in Tianjin have gained some valuable experiences in fully implementing Chairman Mao's great directive, "grasp revolution, promote production."

First, it is necessary to follow Chairman Mao's teaching, "class struggle, once grasped, is effective," and take class struggle as the key link. The No. 4 New Cotton Mill, the largest producer of knitting yarn in Tianjin, had previously struggled with both revolution and production. Now, both have seen a new dawn, with June's production reaching a historic high. Why such a big change? The factory revolutionary committee summarized the experiences of the first half of the year and concluded that it was because they grasped the key link of class struggle. During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, a handful of class enemies in the factory incited people to fight each other, disrupting the revolution and production. After the factory revolutionary committee was established in February this year, with the help of the PLA's support-left personnel, they led the broad revolutionary masses to launch a fierce attack on a handful of class enemies, further exposing the class struggle in the factory, and rooting out a handful of unrepentant capitalist-roaders, traitors, spies, and untransformed landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists. The face of the factory's revolution and production immediately changed.

The broad masses of workers in Tianjin have deeply felt the following through the implementation of Chairman Mao's great directive, "grasp revolution, promote production," with class struggle as the key link: (1) Only by intensifying class struggle, exposing a handful of class enemies, foiling their plots to restore capitalism, and exposing their tricks to sabotage production, can the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution be carried out to the end, and production be guaranteed to be good. (2) By grasping class struggle, all interference can be eliminated, Chairman Mao's latest series of instructions can be implemented, and the great directive "grasp revolution, promote production" can be smoothly carried out. (3) Through intensifying class struggle, a handful of class enemies can be maximally isolated, uniting the broad masses, making revolutionary unity more consolidated. (4) Intensifying class struggle raises the broad masses' awareness of class struggle and line struggle, promoting the deepening of revolutionary big-character posters, and continuously purging the poison of counter-revolutionary revisionism. (5) Intensifying class struggle has further tempered and tested various levels of revolutionary committees, making the committees more consolidated. (6) By grasping class struggle, the morale of the revolutionary masses is greatly boosted, the arrogance of class enemies is greatly dampened, the broad revolutionary masses are proud and confident, and socialist labor enthusiasm is greatly enhanced. (7) Class struggle promotes the widespread dissemination of Mao Zedong Thought. Many factories' Mao Zedong Thought study classes and the mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought have reached a new level.

Second, it is necessary to fully understand and correctly handle the relationship between revolution and production. Workers in Tianjin have felt through practice that: it is necessary to take revolution as the commander, both grasping revolution and promoting production, and not equating revolution with production. Taking revolution as the commander means taking Mao Zedong Thought as the commander and Chairman Mao's latest series of instructions as the commander. The path taken by the Tianjin Internal Combustion Engine Manufacturing Plant is a good example. The proletarian revolutionary faction and revolutionary masses in this plant both grasped revolution and promoted production in the first half of last year, and the situation in the entire plant was very good. However, at the end of last year and the beginning of this year, this plant sometimes did not grasp revolution tightly, and sometimes did not grasp production tightly, resulting in some losses in both revolution and production. The plant revolutionary committee learned from past lessons and, in the past few months, fully implemented Chairman Mao's great directive, "grasp revolution, promote production," intensifying class struggle, carrying out revolutionary big-character posters, promoting ideological revolutionization, further consolidating revolutionary unity and the three-in-one combination, and continuously increasing production, setting a new record for the plant's monthly production level.

Third, it is necessary to combine the characteristics of the industrial front and continuously carry out revolutionary big-character posters to promote the development of productivity. Recently, many factories have combined revolutionary big-character posters with the struggle, criticism, and transformation of their own factories. The broad revolutionary masses have used Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to criticize the revisionist black goods of "expert management," "technology first," "material incentives," and "crawling policy," fiercely attacking the old systems, old regulations, and old institutions that shackle productivity, and attacking the superstructure that does not adapt to the economic base. This has played a very good role in promoting production development. The Tianjin Coal Mine Special Equipment Factory is a medium-sized factory with just over a thousand people, but it has six workshops, eighteen departments, nearly two hundred cadres, and tens of thousands of regulations. This revisionist management system greatly shackles the development of productivity. Recently, the factory revolutionary committee led the broad revolutionary masses to launch a revolution against this revisionist system, first implementing a streamlined and efficient government, and then carrying out revolutionary big-character posters against "expert management" and "crawling policy," breaking the old customs that shackle productivity, and the entire factory quickly saw a surge in technical innovation. In May and June, the production plan was completed ahead of schedule and exceeded the target, and production levels increased by more than 22% compared to the same period in 1966.

Fourth, various levels of revolutionary committees must first become models in implementing the great directive "grasp revolution, promote production," not be interfered with by any bourgeois ideology, repeatedly propagandize this directive's great significance to the broad revolutionary masses, make Chairman Mao's teachings deeply rooted in people's hearts, and turn them into the conscious actions of the broad revolutionary masses. The industrial leadership departments of the Tianjin Revolutionary Committee have always paid attention to repeatedly propagating and fully implementing Chairman Mao's great directive, "grasp revolution, promote production," timely solving various active thoughts among the masses and cadres, eliminating interference from the right and ultra-left, and ensuring the implementation of the directive "grasp revolution, promote production."

    天津工人阶级狠抓阶级斗争工业战线出现一片大好形势
    革命大联合日益巩固，革命大批判正轰轰烈烈地深入展开，人的思想革命化大大前进了一步，生产力得到了大发展
    据新华社天津九日电　天津市工人阶级高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，以阶级斗争为纲，坚定不移地贯彻执行伟大领袖毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，使工业战线的革命和生产出现一片大好形势。目前，天津市工业战线上的革命大联合日益巩固，各级革命委员会在阶级斗争的大风大浪中锻炼得更加坚强，革命大批判正轰轰烈烈地深入展开，人的思想革命化大大前进了一步，生产力得到了大发展。最近几个月来，全市工业生产连续大幅度上升。
    天津市革命委员会有关部门提供的最新情况表明，这种大好形势已经在纺织工业、轻工业、交通运输、机械工业、冶金工业、化学工业、建筑材料工业和基本建设等系统的绝大部分行业里普遍出现。全市列入国家计划的一百四十四种主要产品中，有百分之七十七的产品，六月份的产量比五月份有了增长；其中，钢材、柴油机、齿轮加工机床、起重设备、工业用水泵、烧碱、纯碱、化肥、汽车轮胎、胶鞋、水泥、棉纱、棉布、麻袋、针棉织品、自行车、手表、日用铝制品、塑料鞋等产品的产量都有了较大幅度的增长。不少工厂在创造新技术、试制新产品和节约煤炭、节约原材料等方面，也都做出了出色的成绩。
    天津市许多工厂企业在今年上半年全面贯彻执行毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针中，取得了一些好的经验。
    第一，必须遵照毛主席的“阶级斗争，一抓就灵”的教导，以阶级斗争为纲。天津市生产针织品用纱规模最大的四新纱厂，原来革命和生产一直搞得不大好，现在革命和生产出现一片新气象，六月份的生产水平创造了历史最高纪录。为什么会发生这样大的变化？厂革委会总结上半年的经验，得出了一条结论，就是因为抓住了阶级斗争这个纲。在无产阶级文化大革命中，这个厂的一小撮阶级敌人挑动群众斗群众，破坏革命，破坏生产。工厂革命委员会在今年二月份成立后，在解放军支左人员帮助下，带领广大革命群众向一小撮阶级敌人发动了猛烈进攻，进一步揭开了这个厂的阶级斗争盖子，揪出了一小撮死不悔改的走资派、叛徒、特务和没有改造好的地、富、反、坏、右分子，全厂革命和生产的面貌立即焕然一新。
    天津市广大工人在以阶级斗争为纲，贯彻执行毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针中，深刻地体会到：（一）只有通过狠抓阶级斗争，揪出一小撮阶级敌人，粉碎他们复辟资本主义的阴谋，揭穿他们破坏生产的诡计，才能把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，才能保证把生产搞好。（二）抓了阶级斗争，才能排除一切干扰，落实毛主席一系列最新指示，才能顺利地贯彻“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针。（三）通过大抓阶级斗争，最大限度地孤立一小撮阶级敌人，团结了广大群众，使革命大联合更加巩固。（四）狠抓阶级斗争，提高了广大群众的阶级斗争观念和路线斗争觉悟，促进革命大批判深入开展，不断地肃清反革命修正主义流毒。（五）狠抓阶级斗争，各级革命委员会得到了进一步的锻炼和考验，使革委会更加巩固。（六）抓了阶级斗争，大长革命群众的志气，大灭阶级敌人的威风，广大革命群众扬眉吐气，大大提高了社会主义劳动积极性。（七）阶级斗争，促进了毛泽东思想大普及。很多工厂的毛泽东思想学习班和活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动，出现了新的水平。
    第二，必须全面理解和正确处理革命和生产的关系。天津市的工人从实践中体会到：必须以革命为统帅，既抓革命，又促生产，不能把革命和生产等同起来。以革命为统帅，就是用毛泽东思想为统帅，以毛主席一系列最新指示为统帅。天津内燃机制造厂所走过的道路就是很好的证明。这个厂的无产阶级革命派和革命群众，在去年上半年既抓革命又促生产，全厂的形势很好。去年年底和今年初，这个厂有时对革命抓得不紧，有时对生产抓得不紧，结果使革命和生产都受到一些损失。这个厂的革委会记取了以前的教训，在最近几个月内，全面地贯彻执行毛主席的“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，狠抓阶级斗争，开展革命大批判，促进人的思想革命化，进一步巩固了革命大联合和革命三结合，生产连续大幅度上升，并且刷新了全厂月产水平的最高纪录。
    第三，必须结合工业战线的特点，不间断地开展革命大批判，促进生产力的发展。最近，很多工厂把革命大批判同本厂的斗、批、改结合起来，广大革命群众用毛泽东思想为武器，批判了“专家治厂”、“技术第一”、“物质刺激”、“爬行主义”等修正主义黑货，猛烈地冲击束缚生产力的旧体制、旧规章、旧制度，冲击那些不能适应经济基础的上层建筑，对促进生产的发展起了极好的作用。天津煤矿专用设备厂是个刚刚超过一千人的中型工厂，就有六个车间、十八个科室部门，将近二百个干部，上万条规章制度，这套修正主义的管理体制极大地束缚了生产力的发展。最近，厂革委会带领广大革命群众对这一套修正主义体制发起了革命，首先革委会实行精兵简政，接着，对“专家治厂”、“爬行主义”等开展革命大批判，大破束缚生产力的一套陈规旧习，全厂很快出现了大搞技术革新的热潮。五月份和六月份都提前超额完成了生产计划，并且都比一九六六年同期的生产水平增长了百分之二十二以上。
    第四，各级革命委员会必须首先成为贯彻执行“抓革命，促生产”伟大方针的模范，不受任何资产阶级思潮的干扰，反复地向广大革命群众宣传这一方针的伟大意义，使毛主席的这一教导深入人心，变成广大革命群众的自觉行动。天津市革命委员会工业领导部门一直注意反复宣传和全面落实毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，及时解决群众和干部中的各种活思想，排除来自右的和极“左”方面的干扰，保证了“抓革命，促生产”方针的贯彻执行。
