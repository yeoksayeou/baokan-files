The Uruguayan Left-Wing Revolutionary Movement recently published a statement in its official newspaper, "Voice of the Insurgents," emphasizing the need to combine the universal truths of Marxism-Leninism with the specific practices of the Uruguayan revolution. The movement announced that it has decided to adopt Mao Zedong Thought as its guiding principle for action.

The statement reads: "Comrade Mao Zedong is the Lenin of our time. Marxism-Leninism is the scientific doctrine of the proletariat, the science of proletarian revolution and the construction of socialist society, and the guide for conducting revolution worldwide and continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat to achieve communism. Since its inception, Marxism-Leninism has gone through three great stages in its development: Marx and Engels were the genius founders of proletarian scientific theory. Lenin creatively developed Marxism, ushering in a new stage: the stage of Leninism. Mao Zedong has made tremendous contributions in both theory and practice, showing us that Marxism-Leninism has entered a higher new stage."

The statement continues: "After the death of Stalin, the revisionist clique seized power in the world's first socialist country and began to restore capitalism in the Soviet Union, thus posing new questions for the world proletariat. The counter-revolutionary clique that seized power in Lenin's country is a bunch of traitors who act as accomplices of imperialism in its attempt to strangle the world's national liberation struggles. The fundamental questions posed to the proletariat in the contemporary world are as follows: first, how to achieve liberation in capitalist countries, colonies, and semi-colonial countries; second, how to prevent the restoration of capitalism in socialist countries."

The statement points out: "Comrade Mao Zedong has clearly and positively pointed out the solutions to these problems."

"The problems of how to conduct revolution in colonies and semi-colonial countries have been deeply and completely solved by Comrade Mao Zedong. He has explained that a small country, no matter how weak, can become strong and defeat any imperialist country through a protracted people's war. He has clarified that in the contemporary situation, the national democratic revolution is not of the old type but of the new type, that is, the new democratic revolution, whose ultimate goal is not capitalism but socialism and communism.

"He has formulated the strategy and tactics of relying on the peasantry, establishing rural base areas, and surrounding the cities from the countryside. He has formulated policies regarding the united front, the close connection between the united front and armed struggle, and the absolute leadership of the proletarian party over both the united front and armed struggle.

"He has made new contributions to the problem of party building and the inseparable connection between this process and armed struggle. He has scientifically and accurately pointed out the correct way to fight against various opportunisms, especially right opportunism. He has emphasized the fundamental importance of a new type of army for revolutionary victory. He has clearly defined the line for building this army. He has deeply studied the laws of war and, on this basis, formulated the strategic and tactical thought of people's war. He has determined the mass line for the proletarian party and the people's army."

Regarding the problem of preventing the restoration of capitalism in socialist countries, the statement points out: "Comrade Mao Zedong has analyzed class struggle and its manifestations within socialist society, and he has thoroughly solved this problem. In theory, he has proposed and in practice, he has solved the problem of how to prevent the emergence of revisionism and the restoration of capitalism, and thus carry the revolution to completion under the dictatorship of the proletariat. He personally led the first proletarian cultural revolution in history, which is the struggle launched by the Chinese proletariat under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, with Mao Zedong Thought as the guide, to smash the revisionist elements within the party in thought, politics, and organization to prevent the restoration of capitalism. This proletarian cultural revolution has great historical significance for the world revolution."

The statement says: "Just as the October Revolution spread Leninism to the world, the Chinese proletarian cultural revolution has spread Mao Zedong Thought worldwide. The Chinese proletarian cultural revolution has creatively enriched Marxism's theory of the dictatorship of the proletariat."

The statement emphasizes: "Comrade Mao Zedong has pointed out how to deal with imperialism in the current situation, how to wage an uncompromising struggle against revisionism, and how to prevent the restoration of capitalism in socialist countries, both in theory and practice. This is a creative contribution of universal significance to the proletarian revolution."

The statement further states: "Mao Zedong Thought is the touchstone for distinguishing true Marxist-Leninists from false ones. There is no third way between Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought, and revisionism. Those who claim to be Marxist-Leninists but do not defend and apply Mao Zedong Thought are not true Marxist-Leninists but are either genuine or 'fake' revisionist opportunists, not Marxist-Leninists."

The statement says: "The Left-Wing Revolutionary Movement has decided to take Mao Zedong Thought as its banner."

"We will launch a widespread movement to study and apply Mao Zedong Thought both within and outside the party. We clearly declare that Mao Zedong Thought is our guiding principle. We will build a revolutionary party under the banner of Mao Zedong Thought and rely on this party to face the struggle."

"In our country, the revisionist elements who have usurped the leadership of the Communist Party have turned it into a party that does not engage in revolutionary struggle but spreads bourgeois ideology among the masses, creating a situation where the establishment of a proletarian revolutionary party has become an urgent necessity for advancing the revolution and ending the long stagnation. The experiences of the world, especially Latin America, have indeed proven that revisionism is an ally of imperialism, and without a struggle against revisionism, the revolution cannot advance; people's war, the united front, and the revolutionary party itself cannot develop and grow."

"To build the party, we must take Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought as our guiding ideology, conduct a serious investigation of the country's current situation, derive the correct political line from it as the foundation of the proletarian party. Whether it is the party or the political line, it must be established in the struggle of the masses, closely connected with the masses, and combine theory with practice."

The statement concludes: "As long as we combine the universal truths of Marxism-Leninism with the specific practices of our revolution, we will certainly be able to build a true vanguard party of the proletariat to lead the broad masses, launch a people's war against the powerful oppressors of the people."

    乌拉圭左派革命运动发表声明
    决定以毛泽东思想作为自己行动的指南
    声明说：“毛泽东同志是当代的列宁。马克思列宁主义是无产阶级的科学学说，是无产阶级革命和建设社会主义社会的科学，是在全世界进行革命并在无产阶级专政下继续把革命发展到共产主义的指南。”“马克思列宁主义产生以来，在自己的发展中经历了三个伟大的阶段：马克思和恩格斯是无产阶级科学理论的天才创始人。列宁创造性地发展了马克思主义，马克思主义进入一个新阶段：列宁主义阶段。毛泽东在理论和实践上作出了极其巨大的贡献，这些贡献向我们表明，马克思列宁主义进入了一个更高的新阶段。”
    新华社二十日讯　蒙得维的亚消息：乌拉圭左派革命运动最近在它的机关报《起义之声报》上发表一项声明，强调要把马克思列宁主义的普遍真理同乌拉圭革命的具体实践结合起来，并且宣布，乌拉圭左派革命运动决定以毛泽东思想作为自己行动的指南。
    声明说：“毛泽东同志是当代的列宁。马克思列宁主义是无产阶级的科学学说，是无产阶级革命和建设社会主义社会的科学，是在全世界进行革命并在无产阶级专政下继续把革命发展到共产主义的指南。”
      “马克思列宁主义产生以来，在自己的发展中经历了三个伟大的阶段：马克思和恩格斯是无产阶级科学理论的天才创始人。列宁创造性地发展了马克思主义，马克思主义进入一个新阶段：列宁主义阶段。毛泽东在理论和实践上作出了极其巨大的贡献，这些贡献向我们表明，马克思列宁主义进入了一个更高的新阶段。”
    声明说：“斯大林逝世之后，修正主义集团在世界第一个社会主义国家篡夺了政权，开始在苏联实行资本主义复辟，从而向世界无产阶级提出了新的问题。在列宁的国家篡夺了政权的反革命集团，是一伙叛徒，他们充当帝国主义妄图扼杀世界民族解放斗争的帮凶。在当代，向无产阶级提出的基本问题如下：第一，在资本主义国家、殖民地和附属国如何取得解放；第二，在社会主义国家如何防止资本主义复辟。”
    声明指出：“毛泽东同志明确地、肯定地指出了解决这些问题的办法。”
      “毛泽东同志深刻而完整地解决了在殖民地和附属国如何进行革命的问题。他阐明了，一个弱国，不管多小，为什么能够变成强国并通过持久的人民战争打败任何帝国主义国家，为什么在当代的形势下，民族民主革命不是旧式的而是新式的，即新民主主义革命，其最终的前途不是资本主义，而是社会主义和共产主义。
      “他制定了依靠农民，建立农村根据地，以农村包围城市的战略和策略。他制定了关于统一战线、以及统一战线同武装斗争的密切联系、统一战线和武装斗争二者都要受无产阶级政党的绝对领导的政策。
      “他对党的建设和这个建设过程同武装斗争的不可分割的联系的问题，作出了新的贡献。他科学地、准确地指出了如何进行反对各种机会主义、特别是右倾机会主义的斗争的正确方式。他突出强调了一支新型军队对于革命胜利的根本重要性。他明确地规定了建设这支军队的路线。他深刻研究了战争的规律，并在此基础上制定了人民战争的战略策略思想。他确定了无产阶级政党和人民军队的群众路线。”
    谈到在社会主义国家防止发生资本主义复辟的问题，声明指出：“毛泽东同志分析了阶级斗争及其在社会主义社会内的表现，他第一个彻底解决了这个问题。他在理论上提出了而且在实践上解决了如何防止出现修正主义和资本主义复辟、从而在无产阶级专政条件下把革命进行到底的问题。他亲自领导了历史上第一次无产阶级文化大革命，这就是中国无产阶级在中国共产党领导下，以毛泽东思想为指导，为在思想上、政治上和组织上粉碎党内的修正主义分子以防止资本主义复辟而发动的斗争。这场无产阶级文化大革命，对世界革命具有巨大的历史意义。”
    声明说：正如十月革命向全世界传播了列宁主义一样，中国无产阶级文化大革命在世界范围内传播了毛泽东思想。中国无产阶级文化大革命创造性地丰富了马克思主义关于无产阶级专政的学说。
    声明强调指出，毛泽东同志“指出在目前情况下如何对待帝国主义，毫不容情地开展反对修正主义的斗争，提出在社会主义国家防止发生资本主义复辟的理论并付诸实践，这是对无产阶级革命具有普遍意义的创造性贡献。”
    声明接着说：“毛泽东思想是区分真假马克思列宁主义者的试金石。在马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想同修正主义之间，没有第三条道路。自称马克思列宁主义者而不捍卫和运用毛泽东思想的人，就不是一个真正的马克思列宁主义者，而只是一个正牌的或‘杂牌的’修正主义的机会主义者，绝不是一个马克思列宁主义者。”
    声明说：“左派革命运动决定用毛泽东思想挂帅”，
  “在党内外开展活学活用毛泽东思想的广泛运动。我们明确宣布，毛泽东思想是我们的行动指南。我们将在毛泽东思想旗帜下建设革命的党并依靠这个党来迎接斗争。”
      “在我国，窃踞共产党的领导的修正主义分子，把这个党变成了不进行革命斗争，而在群众中传播资产阶级思想的党，以至造成这样一种形势，即建立无产阶级革命党，已成了在我国推进革命、结束革命长期停滞状态的根本需要。世界的、特别是拉丁美洲的经验确实证明，修正主义是帝国主义的同盟者，如果不进行反对修正主义的斗争，革命就不能前进；人民战争、统一战线和革命党本身就不能发展和壮大。
      “为了建党，必须把马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想作为指导思想，对国家的现状进行认真的调查，从中得出正确的政治路线，作为无产阶级政党的基础。无论是党还是政治路线，都要在群众斗争中建立，要密切联系群众，把理论同实践结合起来。”
    声明最后说：“只要把马克思列宁主义的普遍真理同我国革命的具体实践结合起来，我们就一定能建立一个真正无产阶级先锋队的党，来领导广大群众，发动人民战争反对人民的强大压迫者。”
