The revolutionary workers of the Shijiazhuang Diesel Engine Factory, through a deep criticism of the counter-revolutionary revisionist fallacies such as "expert management" and "technology first" promoted by Chinese Khrushchev and his agents, have displayed a daring spirit of innovation and action. With the strong support of relevant sister units, they have recently successfully developed the "May 7th" - 24 small tractor.

The "May 7th" - 24 small tractor has the advantages of being versatile, flexible, and lightweight. It can not only plow fields and sow seeds but also handle irrigation, drainage, and transportation. It can be used in both plains and mountainous areas. This tractor has been tested in the suburbs of Shijiazhuang and in counties like Jingxing, proving to have excellent performance and has been warmly welcomed by the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants.

    一专多用灵活轻便的小型拖拉机
    石家庄柴油机厂的革命职工，通过对中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人所推行的“专家治厂”“技术第一”等反革命修正主义谬论的深入批判，发扬敢想敢干的革命精神，在有关兄弟单位的大力支持下，最近试制成功了“五·七”—二四小型拖拉机。
      “五·七”—二四小型拖拉机，具有一专多用、灵活轻便的优点，既能耕地、播种，又能排灌、运输，在平原、山地都可以使用。这种拖拉机在石家庄郊区、井陉等县试用，证明性能良好，受到广大贫下中农的欢迎。
