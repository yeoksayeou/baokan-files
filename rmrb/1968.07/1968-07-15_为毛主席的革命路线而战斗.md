Fighting for Chairman Mao's Revolutionary Line

Chairman Mao said: "Revolutionary culture is a powerful weapon for the people's masses." This unprecedentedly intense struggle between two classes and two lines in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution requires revolutionary literature and art to give a concentrated and profound reflection, playing the role of a "powerful weapon for the revolution." Revolutionary young cadres from some schools in Beijing, with hearts full of loyalty to defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and burning anger towards the Chinese Khrushchev, took up their brushes as swords and bravely joined the battle. They created the painting "Chairman Mao Goes to Anshan," which is not just an ordinary oil painting, but a sharp sword aimed at the heart of the Chinese Khrushchev, a song of praise for Chairman Mao's revolutionary line defeating the Chinese Khrushchev's counter-revolutionary revisionist line. This is a great work born in the storm of class struggle, an unprecedented great work of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution era.

Chairman Mao said: "Literature and art are subordinate to politics, but they in turn exert a great influence on politics." In contrast to this revolutionary oil painting, there is a batch of counter-revolutionary literary and artistic works created by the black line, which were used to build monuments for the Chinese Khrushchev. Particularly, there was a large black painting titled "Chinese Khrushchev and the Anshan Miners," which was once praised to the skies by a small clique of reactionary academic "authorities," but now it has been subjected to the merciless criticism of history, and like those black films and black books, it has become a pile of filth despised by humanity. Meanwhile, proletarian revolutionary artworks like "Chairman Mao Goes to Anshan" will shine forever in the history of human literature and art. Isn't this thought-provoking? All revolutionary literary and artistic workers should learn from the young cadres who created "Chairman Mao Goes to Anshan," strive to raise their awareness of the struggle between the two lines, temper their boundless loyalty to the great teacher of the proletariat, Chairman Mao, and create and fight to defend Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line!

    为毛主席的革命路线而战斗
    毛主席说：“革命文化，对于人民大众，是革命的有力武器。”无产阶级文化大革命这场空前激烈的两个阶级、两条路线大搏斗，要求革命文艺给予集中的深刻的反映，发挥其“革命的有力武器”的作用。北京部分院校的革命小将，怀着誓死捍卫毛主席革命路线的赤胆忠心和对中国赫鲁晓夫的满腔怒火，拿起画笔作刀枪，勇敢地参加了战斗。他们创作的《毛主席去安源》，不是一幅普通的油画，而是一把刺向中国赫鲁晓夫心脏的利剑，是一首毛主席革命路线战胜中国赫鲁晓夫反革命修正主义路线的赞歌。这是产生在阶级斗争暴风雨中的伟大作品，这是史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命时代的伟大作品。
    毛主席说：“文艺是从属于政治的，但又反转来给予伟大的影响于政治。”和这幅革命油画相对立，有一批反革命文艺黑线炮制的为中国赫鲁晓夫树碑立传的黑影片、黑书和黑画，特别是那幅题为中国赫鲁晓夫和安源矿工的大黑画，当年被一小撮反动学术“权威”吹捧得天花乱坠，如今却受到了历史的无情批判，和那些黑影片、黑书一样成为不齿于人类的狗屎堆。而《毛主席去安源》等无产阶级革命艺术作品，在人类文艺史上将放射出永不熄灭的光芒。这不是很可以发人深思吗？一切革命的文艺工作者，应该向创作《毛主席去安源》的革命小将学习，努力提高两条路线斗争的觉悟，锤炼对无产阶级伟大导师毛主席的无限忠心，为捍卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线而创作，而战斗！
