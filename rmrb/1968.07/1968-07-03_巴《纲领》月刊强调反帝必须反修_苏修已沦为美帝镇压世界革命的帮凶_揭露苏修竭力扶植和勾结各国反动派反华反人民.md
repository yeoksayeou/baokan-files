The "Program" monthly, published in Karachi, carried an article in its June issue pointing out that the Soviet revisionist leadership has degenerated into a clown helping U.S. imperialism suppress the national liberation movements of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America.

The article says that the Soviet revisionist leadership provided weapons to the fascist military regime of Suharto-Nasution in Indonesia and allowed it to defer repayment of loans, thereby greatly encouraging the Indonesian fascist regime to massacre the revolutionary people of Indonesia.

The article says that in India, the Soviet revisionist leadership, in collusion with U.S. imperialism's policy against China, has not only provided the Indian reactionary government with huge economic "aid" but also supplied it with a large number of airplanes, cannons, tanks, warships, and missiles.

The article says that the Soviet revisionist leadership has also colluded with Japanese militarists, the puppet regime of "Malaysia," the reactionary rulers of Thailand and Burma, and the puppet regime of Mobutu in the Congo (Kinshasa), and has helped the dictatorial regimes in some Latin American countries.

The article points out that while the oppressed revolutionary peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America are rising up to oppose imperialist rule and exploitation, the Soviet revisionist leadership has been constantly spreading reactionary fallacies such as "peaceful transition" and "non-capitalist road," attempting to lull the revolutionary peoples into complacency.

The article points out that the Soviet revisionist leadership is now acting as a prop for the crumbling walls of U.S. imperialism.

The article concludes by saying: Now, the revolutionary peoples of the whole world have recognized that to oppose U.S. imperialism, one must simultaneously oppose modern revisionism centered on the Soviet revisionist leadership.

    新华社拉瓦尔品第电　在卡拉奇出版的《纲领》月刊六月号刊载一篇文章指出，苏修领导集团已堕落成为帮助美帝国主义镇压亚非拉人民民族解放运动的小丑。
    文章说，苏修领导集团给印度尼西亚苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯军人政权提供武器，并让它延期偿还贷款，从而大大地鼓励了印尼法西斯政权屠杀印尼革命人民。
    文章说，在印度，苏修领导集团配合美帝反对中国的政策除了向印度反动政府提供巨大的经济“援助”外，还向它提供大量飞机、大炮、坦克、军舰、导弹等武器。
    文章说，苏修领导集团还勾结日本军国主义者、“马来西亚”傀儡政权、泰国和缅甸的反动统治者以及非洲的刚果（金）蒙博托傀儡政权等，并帮助拉丁美洲一些国家的独裁政权。
    文章指出，在亚非拉被压迫的革命人民起来反对帝国主义的统治和剥削的时候，苏修领导集团不断散布所谓“和平过渡”和“非资本主义道路”之类的反动谬论，企图麻痹革命人民的战斗意志。
    文章指出，苏修领导集团正在充当美帝断壁危楼的支撑者。
    文章最后说：现在全世界的革命人民已经认识到，要反对美帝，就必须同时反对以苏修领导集团为中心的现代修正主义。
