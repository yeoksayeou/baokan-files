The Albanian "Unity" newspaper published a commentary on July 21 condemning the meeting between U.S. President Johnson and the head of the South Vietnamese puppet regime, Nguyen Van Thieu, in Honolulu.

The commentary pointed out that the U.S. imperialist head Johnson and his Saigon lackeys gathered in Honolulu to discuss further measures for the "escalation" of the U.S. government's war of aggression in Vietnam and to plot "peace talks" deception.

The commentary said that Johnson, upon arriving at the Honolulu airport, immediately declared his continued support for the reactionary puppet government in Saigon.

The commentary then listed facts about the U.S. empire's intensified escalation of the war in Vietnam and pointed out that this shows that while the U.S. imperialists are continuing their increasingly dirty aggression, they are using the deceptive "peace talks" propaganda to buy time, so as to further escalate the war of aggression against Vietnam and suppress the liberation movements of the peoples of Asian countries.

The commentary pointed out that the victories already achieved and being achieved by the Vietnamese people in their heroic struggle against the U.S. aggressors have shattered the myth of U.S. military superiority. Whether it is the Honolulu meeting or other plots of aggression already planned and being planned by U.S. imperialists and their lackeys to conquer the Vietnamese people, none of these can save the U.S. and its lackeys from their shameful defeat.

    阿《团结报》谴责约翰逊和阮文绍檀香山会谈
    美帝策划的任何阴谋决不会得逞
    新华社地拉那二十一日电　阿尔巴尼亚《团结报》二十一日发表短评，谴责美帝头子约翰逊和南越傀儡集团头目阮文绍在檀香山的会谈。
    短评指出，美帝头子约翰逊及其西贡走狗聚集在檀香山，讨论美国政府在侵越战争的“升级”和策划“和谈”骗局方面的进一步措施。
    短评说，约翰逊到檀香山机场就扬言要继续支持西贡反动傀儡政府。
    短评接着在列举了美帝加紧进行侵越战争“升级”的事实之后指出，这表明，美帝国主义者在继续其更加肮脏的侵略的同时，利用蛊惑人心的“和谈”宣传和骗局来赢得时间，以便进一步把侵略越南的战争“升级”，进而镇压亚洲各国人民的解放运动。
    短评指出，越南人民在反对美国侵略者的英勇斗争中已经取得的和正在取得的胜利，粉碎了所谓美国军事优势的神话。无论是檀香山会谈，还是美帝国主义者及其走狗为征服越南人民而已经策划和正在策划的其它侵略阴谋，都不能把美帝及其走狗从可耻的失败中挽救出来。
