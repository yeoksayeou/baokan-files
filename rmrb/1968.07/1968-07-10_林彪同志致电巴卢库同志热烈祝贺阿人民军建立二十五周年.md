Comrade Lin Biao, Vice Premier of the State Council and Minister of National Defense, sent a cable today to Comrade Beqir Balluku, Vice Premier of the Council of Ministers and Minister of National Defense of the People's Republic of Albania, warmly congratulating the 25th anniversary of the founding of the Albanian People's Army. The full text of the congratulatory message is as follows:

Vice Premier of the Council of Ministers and Minister of National Defense of the People's Republic of Albania, Dear Comrade Beqir Balluku:

The Chinese people and all the officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army warmly congratulate the fraternal Albanian People's Army on its 25th anniversary. We warmly congratulate you on the brilliant victories you have achieved in the past 25 years in the revolutionary struggle against imperialism and revisionism and in strengthening your own revolutionary construction.

Under the wise leadership of Comrade Enver Hoxha and the Albanian Party of Labor, the fraternal Albanian People's Army has held high the red banner of Marxism-Leninism and waged an arduous and heroic revolutionary struggle, writing a glorious chapter in history. In the anti-fascist national liberation war, you, together with the Albanian people, defeated the Italian-German invaders and liberated your own country. After liberation, you "held a hoe in one hand and a gun in the other," bravely defending your homeland. You have repeatedly foiled the subversive activities of American imperialism and its running dogs, the Tito traitor clique, and Soviet modern revisionism, and have successfully carried out the socialist revolution and socialist construction, turning Albania into a strong red fortress.

The heroic Albanian People's Army faithfully implements the proletarian military line of the Albanian Party of Labor. In recent years, you have carried out a series of major revolutionary measures of the Party, launching a powerful revolutionary mass movement. You have greatly strengthened the militia work and achieved great success. You have enthusiastically responded to the great call of Comrade Enver Hoxha, the great leader of the Albanian people, to place political work in the first position and to build the people's army into a revolutionary army that is both a fighting force, a work force, and a production force. The entire army is full of revolutionary vigor, effectively promoting war preparedness and driving the construction of all aspects, further consolidating the proletarian dictatorship in Albania. The Albanian People's Army is indeed a heroic army that is loyal to the people and the revolution and has been tested by time.

Our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out: "The proletariat and working people of Europe, North America, and Oceania are in a new awakening." The recent great revolutionary storm sweeping through France, Europe, and North America has powerfully impacted the decaying capitalist system. In this great revolutionary storm, the traitorous face of the modern revisionist group centered around the CPSU has been more exposed. Their days are even worse. The heroic people of Albania, this great socialist beacon in Europe, shine even brighter, greatly inspiring the revolutionary people of Europe and the world who are in the struggle.

Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out: "Although China and Albania are separated by thousands of mountains and rivers, our hearts are connected. We are your true friends and comrades. You are also our true friends and comrades. 'No matter what happens in the world, our two parties and peoples will definitely unite, fight together, and win together.' The Chinese people and the Chinese People's Liberation Army, tempered by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, will definitely hold high the great red banner of Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought, forever follow Chairman Mao's teachings, and continuously strengthen the great fighting unity with the Albanian people and the Albanian People's Army, and strive together to overthrow imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries in all countries!

We wish the fraternal Albanian People's Army new and greater victories in the revolutionary struggle and revolutionary construction!

Vice Premier of the State Council and Minister of National Defense of the People's Republic of China

    林彪同志致电巴卢库同志热烈祝贺阿人民军建立二十五周年
    新华社九日讯　国务院副总理兼国防部长林彪同志今天打电报给阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国部长会议副主席兼国防部长贝基尔·巴卢库同志，热烈祝贺阿尔巴尼亚人民军建立二十五周年。贺电全文如下：阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国部长会议副主席兼国防部长亲爱的贝基尔·巴卢库同志：
    中国人民和中国人民解放军全体指战员热烈祝贺兄弟的阿尔巴尼亚人民军建立二十五周年。我们热烈祝贺你们二十五年来在反帝、反修的革命斗争中、在加强自己的革命化建设中所取得的辉煌胜利。
    兄弟的阿尔巴尼亚人民军，在以恩维尔·霍查同志为首的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党的英明领导下，高举马克思列宁主义的革命红旗，进行了英勇卓绝的革命斗争，写下了光荣的历史。在反法西斯的民族解放战争中，你们和阿尔巴尼亚人民团结在一起，打败了意大利—德国侵略者，解放了自己的祖国，解放后，又“一手拿镐，一手拿枪”，英勇地保卫着祖国，一次又一次地粉碎了美帝国主义及其走狗、铁托叛徒集团和苏联现代修正主义的颠覆活动，胜利地进行了社会主义革命和社会主义建设，把阿尔巴尼亚建设成了坚强的红色堡垒。
    英雄的阿尔巴尼亚人民军忠实地执行了阿尔巴尼亚劳动党的无产阶级建军路线。近几年来，你们贯彻了劳动党的一系列重大的革命化措施，掀起了一个气势磅礴的革命化群众运动。你们大力加强了民兵工作，取得了很大的成绩。你们热烈响应阿尔巴尼亚人民的伟大领袖恩维尔·霍查同志把政治工作摆在首位和把人民军建设成为既是战斗队，又是工作队和生产队的革命军队的伟大号召，全军上下呈现出一片朝气蓬勃的革命景象，有力地促进了战备，推动了各方面的建设，进一步巩固了阿尔巴尼亚的无产阶级专政。阿尔巴尼亚人民军不愧是一支忠于人民、忠于革命的、久经考验的英雄军队。
    我国人民的伟大领袖毛主席指出：“欧洲、北美和大洋洲的无产阶级和劳动人民，正处在新的觉醒之中。”最近席卷法国、欧洲和北美的群众运动的伟大革命风暴，猛烈地冲击着腐朽没落的资本主义制度。在这场伟大的革命风暴中，以苏共领导为中心的现代修正主义集团的叛徒嘴脸更加暴露。他们的日子更加不好过了。英雄的人民的阿尔巴尼亚这盏欧洲的伟大的社会主义明灯更加光芒四射，极大地鼓舞着斗争中的欧洲和全世界的革命人民。
    毛泽东同志指出：“中阿两国远隔千山万水，我们的心是连在一起的。我们是你们真正的朋友和同志。你们也是我们真正的朋友和同志。”“不管世界上发生什么事情，我们两党、两国人民，一定团结在一起，战斗在一起，胜利在一起。”经过无产阶级文化大革命锻炼的中国人民和中国人民解放军，一定更高地举起马克思主义、列宁主义、毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，永远遵循毛主席的教导，不断加强同阿尔巴尼亚人民和阿尔巴尼亚人民军的伟大战斗团结，为打倒帝国主义，打倒现代修正主义，打倒各国反动派而共同奋斗！
    祝兄弟的阿尔巴尼亚人民军在革命斗争和革命化建设中取得新的更巨大的胜利！
    中华人民共和国国务院副总理兼国防部长
