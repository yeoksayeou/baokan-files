The workers of the Suzhou Ink Factory in Jiangsu, with boundless loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao and the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, under the help of the People's Liberation Army, have been focusing on the revolution and vigorously promoting production. They have completed ahead of schedule and exceeded the production quota for the first half of the year for inks used in printing Chairman Mao's works and portraits. They have also successfully developed gold ink, thinner, and gloss enhancer.

This factory specializes in producing inks for printing "Selected Works of Mao Zedong," "Quotations from Chairman Mao," and portraits of Chairman Mao. To better complete this important production task, the revolutionary committee of the factory established a Mao Zedong Thought study class in April. This was done to raise the class struggle consciousness and the consciousness of the struggle between the two lines among the revolutionary workers, making them deeply understand that Mao Zedong Thought is a powerful ideological weapon for defeating imperialism, revisionism, reactionaries of all countries, and the ideological weapons of all exploiting classes. Producing high-quality inks and printing Chairman Mao's works better is contributing to the Chinese revolution and the world revolution. The revolutionary workers are full of spirit and, with revolutionary enthusiasm, have overcome production difficulties. By mid-June, they had exceeded the production quota for the first half of the year.

In the process of producing inks, the revolutionary workers insisted on self-reliance and a spirit of striving for progress. They continuously developed new products. In the past, the gold ink used for printing the covers of Chairman Mao's works was imported from abroad and was always subject to the blockade by imperialist, revisionist, and reactionary countries. The revolutionary workers were determined to find their own way. They used Chairman Mao's teaching that "we can learn what we originally do not understand" to inspire themselves. Without samples or technical data, they dared to experiment and practice. Finally, with the cooperation of sister units, after multiple trials, they successfully developed a relatively ideal gold ink, making an important contribution to the nationwide printing of gold-red covers for Chairman Mao's works. To adjust the elasticity of the ink and enhance its gloss, the revolutionary workers recently also successfully developed a thinner and gloss enhancer, which have been put into production.

    把红色宝书印得更加金光灿烂
    苏州油墨厂试制成功调金油等产品，为印制毛主席著作作出贡献
    本报讯　江苏苏州市油墨厂革命职工，怀着对伟大领袖毛主席和战无不胜的毛泽东思想的无限忠心，在人民解放军帮助下，狠抓革命，猛促生产，提前超额完成了上半年印制毛主席著作和毛主席像的油墨生产任务，并试制成功了调金油、稀薄剂和亮光剂。
    这个工厂专门生产供印制《毛泽东选集》《毛主席语录》和毛主席像的油墨。为了更好地完成这项重要的生产任务，厂革委会在今年四月份成立后，就办起了毛泽东思想学习班，提高革命职工的阶级斗争觉悟和两条路线斗争觉悟，使他们深刻地认识到，毛泽东思想是战胜帝国主义、修正主义、各国反动派和一切剥削阶级思想的强大思想武器，生产优质的油墨，把毛主席著作印刷得更好，就是为中国革命和世界革命贡献了自己的力量。革命职工个个精神焕发，以冲天的革命干劲克服了生产上的困难，到六月中旬，就超额完成了上半年的油墨生产任务。
    在生产油墨的过程中，革命职工坚持自力更生、奋发图强的革命精神，不断试制新品种。过去，印刷毛主席著作封面所需的印金油墨，是从国外进口的，一直受到帝、修、反国家的封锁。革命职工决心闯出自己的路子。他们用毛主席关于“我们能够学会我们原来不懂的东西”的教导激励自己，在没有试样品和技术资料的情况下，大胆尝试，大胆实践。终于在兄弟单位的配合下，经过多次试验，试制成功比较理想的调金油，为全国印制金红印金的毛主席著作封面作出了重要贡献。为了调节油墨的韧性和增强油墨的光泽，革命职工最近又试制成功稀薄剂和亮光剂，并投入生产。
