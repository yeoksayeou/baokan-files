The military representatives of the Chengdu Emei Machinery Factory Revolutionary Committee have led the entire committee to focus on ideological revolution and maintain close ties with the masses. In their efforts to connect with the people, they frequently discuss with other committee members, enthusiastically helping them overcome ideological barriers to connecting with the masses. The Revolutionary Committee's ties with the masses have become increasingly broad and close, and the entire factory's revolutionary and production efforts are showing a very good situation.

Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, July 25 — The Chengdu Emei Machinery Factory Revolutionary Committee, under the leadership of the military representatives participating in the committee, has focused on the ideological revolution within the committee. This has pushed the Revolutionary Committee forward in building a "revolutionary and mass-connected leadership team."

The four military representatives participating in the Emei Machinery Factory Revolutionary Committee, based on the experience of revolutionary committee construction in the military leadership, believe: To carry forward the great leader Chairman Mao's personally cultivated party style of maintaining close ties with the masses, the Revolutionary Committee members must first focus on their own ideological revolution. Without focusing on ideological revolution, revolutionary style cannot be established. In this regard, they first set an example. Military representative and Vice Chairman of the Revolutionary Committee, Comrade Geng Shu, often emphasizes to the military representatives: Because the revolutionary masses support and love the People's Liberation Army, they may overlook or forgive our military representatives' shortcomings and mistakes. This makes us all the more conscious of placing ourselves under the supervision of the masses. The four military representatives participating in the Revolutionary Committee, whenever they find that they have not fully understood or timely discovered any issues in their work with the masses, they first focus on their own active thoughts, using Chairman Mao's teachings for comparison, examination, and resolution. While setting an example, the military representatives also enthusiastically help other members of the Revolutionary Committee. In their efforts to connect with the masses, they frequently discuss with other members, concretely solving various active thoughts that arise. When encountering representative active thoughts, they turn the resolution of one active thought into a political lesson for the entire Revolutionary Committee. First, be a student of the masses

In March of this year, an incident occurred where production in the 49th Workshop could not keep up. Several team leaders sought out Revolutionary Committee member Ni Xiangsheng, who frequently visits the workshop, to discuss solutions. Ni Xiangsheng was also anxious but thought of his role as a Revolutionary Committee member, believing that every word and action must be mindful of his "status," otherwise, if the problem is not solved well, it would be "losing face." He waited for everyone to finish speaking before saying that a few people were seeking comfort and not working hard, and that a meeting should be held to clarify the masses' thoughts. He also instructed the team leaders to strictly enforce attendance regulations. The team leaders felt this was not the case and disagreed with his proposal. The issue was reflected in the Revolutionary Committee, and the military representatives discussed it with Ni Xiangsheng. From his concerns about "status" and "losing face," they saw this issue: When Revolutionary Committee members help the masses solve problems, do they first become students and then teachers, or do they only act as "referees"? The military representatives and Ni Xiangsheng studied Chairman Mao's teachings on "To be the teacher of the people, one must first be the student of the people." At this time, news came from the workshop that several old workers, in an effort to trial-produce a new product, had not left the machine for three days and nights. The military representatives immediately seized this fact to illustrate the great enthusiasm and initiative hidden within the masses. They then further helped Ni Xiangsheng analyze the ideological barriers that prevented him from connecting with the masses and releasing their initiative. Ni Xiangsheng's understanding deepened, and he shed his burdens. He returned to the 49th Workshop, where production was lagging, and worked with the masses to solve production problems. He saw that the 5th Production Team, under the same conditions as other teams, was leading in production. He chose a high-standard "molding" process from this team and worked with the workers, humbly learning from the masses. Soon, he summarized a set of experiences using Mao Zedong Thought to lead the breakthrough of key production issues. After this experience was promoted throughout the workshop, production quickly improved.

The military representatives believed this incident had significant educational value for the Revolutionary Committee itself and proposed a special discussion among all committee members on what they had learned from Comrade Ni Xiangsheng. Ni Xiangsheng first shared his thoughts. He said, "In the past, I often wanted to 'clarify' the masses' thoughts but did not first clarify my own thoughts. After becoming a Revolutionary Committee member, I gradually developed a mindset of being mindful of my 'status' and fearing 'losing face.' In reality, this is the idea of being a high-ranking official spread by Liu Shaoqi, not Chairman Mao's teaching of 'appearing before the people as an ordinary laborer, immersing oneself among the people, and blending in with the people.' Other members of the Revolutionary Committee were deeply educated by this incident and concluded: To maintain close ties with the masses, one must first be a student of the masses. Pay attention to widely connecting with the masses

Military representative and Vice Chairman of the Revolutionary Committee, Comrade Geng Shu, discovered in his work that some revolutionary mass representatives in the Revolutionary Committee often only connect with the most familiar and compatible part of the masses, rather than with the broad masses.

He seized an incident to solve this issue among the Revolutionary Committee members. Workers in the 81st Workshop had disagreements on several issues. Revolutionary Committee member Zhao Qingyu, who is in charge of this workshop, often only stayed with a part of the masses because of good feelings, compatibility, and obedience to one side, handling issues based on one side's opinions. When Comrade Geng Shu discussed this issue with Zhao Qingyu, Zhao Qingyu still believed that a leader should have a few close friends among the masses. Comrade Geng Shu pointed out to him that a leader should have close friends among the masses, but when handling issues, they should not just follow the opinions of a few familiar friends. Instead, they should learn to listen to the opinions of the broad masses and learn to listen to opinions from all sides. Comrade Geng Shu suggested that he attend the Mao Zedong Thought study class held in this workshop to listen to the opinions of the broad worker masses. In the study class, the masses cited many examples showing that Zhao Qingyu usually only interacted with the most familiar and compatible part of the people, ignoring the majority. The workers said, "Revolutionary Committee members are elected by all of us, and they should hold power for the broad revolutionary masses." The workers' criticism made Zhao Qingyu realize his shortcomings. In the Revolutionary Committee meeting and in the workshop, Zhao Qingyu sincerely checked himself. From then on, he widely interacted with the masses and, when encountering issues, fully listened to various different opinions. The masses reflected, "Correcting shortcomings is what makes a good representative."

In solving this issue, the Revolutionary Committee members re-studied Chairman Mao's teachings on "wholeheartedly serving the people of China and the world." They expressed that connecting with the masses must start from Chairman Mao's great teachings. From then on, the Revolutionary Committee members' connections with the masses became broader. Listen more to the masses' criticism

The Revolutionary Committee, in leading the revolutionary masses to launch a revolutionary criticism and fierce attack on a small handful of class enemies, achieved results and gained the support and trust of the masses. At this time, some committee members, when approaching the masses, liked to hear about their achievements and disliked hearing about their shortcomings, preferring praise over criticism. As soon as this thought emerged, the military representatives immediately seized it and resolved it promptly.

In May of this year, military representative Han Feiwu, responsible for establishing a grassroots leadership team, and other committee members proposed immediately electing a production leadership team in the 41st Workshop, where the movement was developing rapidly, and planned to summarize experiences from this to promote throughout the factory. However, this plan was met with opposition from the masses as soon as it was proposed. Some committee members, seeing the masses' opposition, were not very happy, believing that the workshop's affairs were difficult to handle. Han Feiwu felt that the masses had raised criticisms, indicating that his proposed plan must have problems. Thus, he and other committee members returned to the 41st Workshop and presented their views to the masses for discussion. The workshop workers said: Leadership team members must be produced after repeated brewing and discussion. Han Feiwu felt that the masses' opinions were very reasonable and enthusiastically expressed his acceptance, sincerely criticizing himself for his hasty plan.

At the suggestion of the military representatives, the entire Revolutionary Committee discussed this issue and unanimously agreed that the Revolutionary Committee should use various methods to widely listen to the masses' opinions.

Under the leadership and help of the military representatives, the Revolutionary Committee members one by one eliminated the ideological barriers to connecting with the masses, and their relationships with the masses became increasingly close. Therefore, they clearly understood the masses' opinions and demands, solving problems promptly and appropriately, greatly arousing the revolutionary enthusiasm of the broad masses, and the entire factory's revolutionary and production efforts presented a thriving and prosperous situation.

The Revolutionary Committee of the Fifth Silk Factory in Leshan County, Sichuan Province, under the help of the military support group stationed in the factory, deeply mobilized the masses and took the initiative to launch a fierce attack on class enemies. This is the military support group stationed in the factory, deeply entering the workshop and studying with revolutionary workers the teachings of Chairman Mao on "Never forget class struggle," raising the broad workers' awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines.

    成都峨眉机械厂革委会军队代表带动革委会全体成员
    狠抓思想革命化　紧密联系群众
    军队代表在深入群众联系群众中，经常同其他委员谈心，热情帮助他们解决联系群众的思想障碍。革委会和群众的联系越来越广泛、密切，全厂革命和生产呈现一派大好形势
    新华社成都二十五日电　成都峨眉机械厂革命委员会，在参加革委会的军队代表的带动下，狠抓自身的思想革命化，使革命委员会朝着建设成为“革命化的联系群众的领导班子”的方向，大踏步前进。
    参加峨眉机械厂革委会的四个军队代表，根据部队领导机关革命化建设的经验，认为：发扬伟大领袖毛主席亲自培育的党的紧密联系群众的作风，革委会成员首先要狠抓自身的思想革命化。不狠抓思想革命化，革命的作风就建立不起来。在这方面，他们首先做了榜样。军队代表、革委会副主任耿曙同志，经常对军队的代表强调：由于革命群众拥护和热爱人民解放军，因此就可能忽略或原谅我们军队代表的缺点和错误。这就越发要求我们自觉地置身于群众的监督之下。参加革委会的四个军队代表，每当发现自己在联系群众方面，那怕有一点情况了解得不深不透，问题发现得不及时，都首先狠抓自己的活思想，用毛主席的教导，加以对照、检查和解决。军队代表在以身作则的同时，并热情帮助革委会的其他成员。在深入群众、联系群众中，他们经常同其他成员谈心，具体解决不断产生的种种活思想。遇有代表性的活思想，他们便注意把解决一次活思想，变成对革委会全体成员的一堂政治课。首先当群众的学生
    今年三月间，发生过这样一件事，四九车间的生产一时上不去，几个生产组组长，就找经常去这个车间的革委会委员倪祥生同志，商量解决的办法。倪祥生心里也很着急，但又想到自己是革委会成员，一言一行都要注意“身份”，不然，问题解决不好，会“丢面子”。他等大家把意见谈完，才说，少数人图安逸，不安心生产，要开大会打通一下群众的思想。他并要各生产组长，从严格考勤制度方面抓好这件事情。生产组长们认为不是这么一回事，不同意他这个主张。意见反映到革委会，军队代表就找倪祥生同志交谈，从他注意“身份”、怕“丢面子”等等活思想中，看到这样一个问题：革委会成员帮助群众解决问题的时候，是先当学生，后当先生，还是只当“裁判员”？军队代表和倪祥生同志一起学习了毛主席关于“要做人民的先生，先做人民的学生”的教导。这时，从车间传出了几个老工人为试制一种新产品，三天三夜不离开机器的消息，军队代表立刻抓住这一事实，说明群众中蕴藏了巨大的热情和积极性。然后，进一步帮助倪祥生分析了阻碍他深入群众，去发挥群众的积极性的思想障碍。倪祥生的认识提高了，包袱丢掉了，再次深入到生产一时上不去的四九车间去，和工人群众一起解决生产中的问题，他看到第五生产组在和其它组一样的条件下，生产一马当先，便到这个组挑选了一个工艺标准要求最高的“打模子”工序，和工人同劳动，虚心向群众学习。不久，他总结了一套用毛泽东思想挂帅，突破生产关键问题的经验。这一经验在全车间推广后，生产很快突上去了。
    军队代表认为这件事，对革委会本身很有教育意义，便向革委会所有成员提议，专门座谈讨论从倪祥生同志身上学到了什么？倪祥生同志先谈了自己的体会。他说，过去动不动就要“打通”群众的思想，却没有先打通自己的思想。自己当了革委会委员以后，就慢慢有了一种注意“身份”、怕“丢面子”的思想，实际上这是中国赫鲁晓夫散布的那一套做官当老爷的高人一等的思想。不是毛主席教导的“以普通劳动者的姿态，出现在群众面前，深入于群众之中，同群众打成一片”的思想。革委会其他成员，都从这件事受到了很深的教育，他们得出的结论是：要做到紧密联系群众，必须首先当群众的小学生。注意广泛联系群众
    军队代表、革委会副主任耿曙同志在工作中发现，革委会中有些革命群众代表，联系群众往往光联系最熟悉、最合得来的一部分人，而不能联系广大群众。
    对这个问题，他抓住这样一件事，在革委会成员中作了解决。八一车间的工人曾在几个问题上发生了争执，分工管这个车间的革委会成员赵清玉同志，却经常只和一部分群众在一起，因为感情好，合得来，听话听一面的，处理问题也根据一方面的意见。耿曙同志同赵清玉同志谈这个问题时，赵清玉同志还认为，一个领导成员，在群众中交几个知心朋友，是对的。耿曙同志向他指出，一个领导成员要同群众交知心朋友，但是处理问题，却不能几个老相识说怎么办就怎么办，而要学会听取广大群众的意见，学会听取各方面的意见。耿曙同志建议他到这个车间举办的毛泽东思想学习班，听听广大工人群众的意见。在学习班里，群众举出不少事例，说明赵清玉同志日常接触的只是自己最熟悉、最合得来的一部分人，对于更多的人，就不理睬了。工人们说：“革委会委员是我们大家选出来的，要为广大革命群众掌好权。”工人的批评，使赵清玉认识到自己的缺点。在革委会的会议上，在车间里，赵清玉认真作了检查。从此，他广泛地接触群众，遇事充分听取各种不同意见。群众反映说：“有缺点就改掉，这才是我们的好代表。”
    在解决这一问题的过程中，革委会委员重新学习了毛主席关于“全心全意为中国和世界的绝大多数人服务”的教导。他们表示，联系群众，必须从毛主席的这一伟大教导出发。从此，革委会委员同群众之间的联系更广泛了。多倾听群众的批评意见
    革委会在带领革命群众开展革命大批判，向一小撮阶级敌人猛烈进攻中，做出了成绩，受到了群众的拥护和信任。这时，有的委员在接近群众中，就喜欢别人谈成绩，不喜欢谈缺点，爱听赞扬自己的话，不爱听批评自己的话。这种思想一露头，军队代表立即把它抓住，及时予以解决。
    今年五月间，负责抓成立基层领导班子工作的军队代表韩非伍同志和别的委员，主张在运动发展较快的四一车间立即选举生产领导班子，并打算从中总结经验，在全厂推广。可是这个计划一提出来，就遭到了群众的反对。有的委员见群众反对，就不大高兴，认为这个车间的事情难办。韩非伍同志觉得群众提出了批评，说明自己提出的计划一定有问题。于是他和别的委员一道，又到四一车间，把自己的看法提出来和群众商量。车间的工人说：领导班子成员必须经过反复酝酿、讨论后才能产生。韩非伍感到群众的意见很有道理，热情表示接受，并对自己急于求成的打算，作了诚恳的自我批评。
    在军队代表提议下，革委会全体成员讨论了这个问题，一致认为，革委会应当采用各种方式，广泛听取群众的意见。
    革委会成员在军队代表的带动和帮助下，一个一个地扫除着联系群众的思想障碍，和群众的关系越来越亲密，因而对群众的意见和要求看得清，解决问题及时、中肯，大大激发了广大群众的革命热情，全厂革命和生产呈现出一派蓬蓬勃勃的大好形势。（附图片）
    四川省乐山县第五丝厂革命委员会，在驻厂解放军支左小组的帮助下，深入发动群众，主动向阶级敌人发起猛烈进攻。这是驻厂解放军支左小组深入车间和革命职工一起学习毛主席关于  “千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的教导，提高广大职工的阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟。                                             本报通讯员摄
