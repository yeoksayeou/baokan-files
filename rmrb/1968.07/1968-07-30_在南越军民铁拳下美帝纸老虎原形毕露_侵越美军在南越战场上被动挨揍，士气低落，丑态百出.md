The U.S. aggressor troops in South Vietnam are taking a beating on the battlefield, their morale is low, and they are making a spectacle of themselves.

According to a report from the New China News Agency in Hanoi on the 27th, since the beginning of this year, the U.S. aggressor troops have suffered increasingly heavy casualties and their morale has plummeted in the face of the iron fist of the South Vietnamese military and civilians. Despite the U.S. military's attempts to boost morale through increased pay, leave, and even encouraging drug use, these measures have all failed. Incidents of desertion and refusal to fight are on the rise. This fully exposes the paper tiger nature of the seemingly powerful U.S. imperialism.

The Incurable "Surprise Disease"

The U.S. aggressor troops, burned out by the people's war in South Vietnam, are constantly worried about being attacked and many have developed a "surprise disease" similar to that which appeared during the Korean War. According to a report in a Macau newspaper, a U.S. soldier named Jackson, who was on leave in Hong Kong, "suddenly thought of returning to Vietnam to die the next morning and burst into tears in public, refusing to return to Vietnam." Jackson, when talking about the South Vietnamese Liberation Army, admitted with fear, "They are very elusive. They are not afraid of death at all. When they fight, we are simply doomed. They seem to be able to disappear into the ground, completing their mission and vanishing without a trace, and we have no idea how they leave." This American soldier admitted that once, when he suddenly encountered two South Vietnamese Liberation Army soldiers, "due to excessive panic, he dropped his weapon and ran away, barely saving his life." Jackson also complained, "Our officers are also afraid of the guerrillas (referring to the South Vietnamese Liberation Army), so they often beat the soldiers to boost their courage and vent their frustration."

As the U.S. military's defeats become more severe and the number of wounded increases, the U.S. authorities have had to send large numbers of wounded soldiers to Japan for treatment. The Tokyo Shimbun revealed that "a large part of the wounded soldiers are suffering from 'war neurosis' due to defeats in Vietnam." According to reports, this "war neurosis" is spreading among the U.S. troops in Vietnam. Many American soldiers are increasingly despondent and long to go home. A song very popular among U.S. troops in Vietnam is "We Want to Go Home." The U.S. News & World Report recently lamented that young American soldiers sent to the South Vietnamese battlefield "always carry their 'short-term calendars,' crossing off the days until they return to the United States," while high-ranking military officers in the U.S. military "are also eager to end their term of service here (referring to South Vietnam) and leave."

Anti-War Incidents on the Rise

Under the powerful New Year offensive of the South Vietnamese Liberation Army, more and more American soldiers are deserting out of fear of death. Large numbers of U.S. military officials have fled from South Vietnam to Hong Kong with their families. According to a report in a Hong Kong newspaper: "From February 2nd to 12th, over a thousand U.S. military and civilian officials and their families fled to Hong Kong and stayed in hotels." Some U.S. troops, taking advantage of their leave abroad, have sought opportunities to desert. A Hong Kong newspaper published an article in May stating that Japan had become a "haven for deserters" for U.S. troops in Vietnam. According to the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department, from last October to mid-May this year, a total of 70 U.S. military personnel in Vietnam successfully deserted in Japan. The article also revealed that in Japan, there are currently "underground organizations" helping U.S. soldiers to desert.

Anti-war sentiment is growing among U.S. troops in Vietnam, and incidents of soldiers refusing to follow orders and fight are on the rise. Recently, two more anti-war U.S. soldiers defected to the liberated areas. This anti-war sentiment has spread to the United States. According to the U.S. Guardian Weekly, soldiers within the U.S. military who are dissatisfied with the Vietnam War often openly shirk their duties, resist orders, or use violence against officers despite the reactionary officers' suppression; some soldiers have even established their own organizations and published newspapers to expose U.S. aggression in Vietnam. Some young men who have been conscripted do not want to go to Vietnam to die and even resort to measures such as removing their spleens to avoid military service.

### 在南越军民铁拳下美帝纸老虎原形毕露  侵越美军在南越战场上被动挨揍，士气低落，丑态百出

    在南越军民铁拳下美帝纸老虎原形毕露
    侵越美军在南越战场上被动挨揍，士气低落，丑态百出
    据新华社河内二十七日电　今年以来，美国侵略强盗在南越军民的铁拳的沉重打击下，伤亡越来越惨重，士气越来越低落，尽管美国军方不断地用加饷、休假甚至用鼓励吸毒等办法来“鼓舞”士气，可是这些办法都纷纷宣告破产。逃跑、拒战的事件日益增多。这充分暴露了貌似强大的美帝国主义的纸老虎本质。
          不治的“吃惊病”
    被越南南方人民战争火海烧得焦头烂额的美国侵略军，日夜担心挨揍，许多人患上了象在侵朝战争中曾经出现过的“吃惊病”。据澳门一家报纸刊载的消息报道，在香港度假的一个名叫杰克逊的侵越美军士兵“在一间酒巴狂饮时，突然想到明晨就要返回越南去送死，竟在大庭广众中放声大哭起来，表示不愿返回越南”。杰克逊在谈到越南南方人民解放武装力量时，心有余悸地承认，南越人民解放武装力量“真难捉摸”。“他们非常不怕死，打起仗来，我们简直非死不可。他们好象会土遁，任务完成便不见了，怎样离去，我们完全不知道。”这个美国少爷兵承认，有一次，当他突然遇上两名南越解放军战士时，“由于过度惊慌，丢掉手中武器，回身就逃，才捡回了这条命”。杰克逊还发牢骚说，“我们的长官也同样怕民军（指越南南方人民解放武装力量），所以他们经常殴打士兵来壮胆和发泄他们心中的闷气”。
    随着美军失败越来越惨重，伤兵日益增多，美军当局不得不把大批伤兵运往日本治疗。日本《东京新闻》透露，美军“伤员中有很大一部分是因为在越南吃了败仗而患了‘战争恐怖症’。”据报道，这种“战争恐怖症”正在侵越美军中不断蔓延。许多美国兵的沮丧情绪日增，盼望早日回家。在侵越美军中非常流行的一首歌是“我们要回家”。《美国新闻与世界报道》最近哀叹，被送到南越战场
  “服一次兵役的年轻（美国）军人们总是带着他们‘短期日历’，把日子一天天地勾掉，直到他们返回美国去”，而美军中的高级军官们“也是同样地渴望结束他们在这里（指南越）的服役期限，离开这里。”
          反战事件层出不穷
    在越南南方人民解放武装力量新春的强大攻势的打击下，由于怕死而开小差逃跑的美国佬越来越多。大批侵越美军官员拖男带女从南越逃到香港避难。据香港报纸报道：“由二月二日到十二日止的十一天内，逃到香港住上酒店的美国侵越文武官员及其家属，超过一千人”。有的侵越美军趁着在国外“度假”期间，寻机逃跑。香港一家报纸五月份发表一篇文章说，日本已成为侵越美军的“逃亡圣地”。据日本警视厅公布，自去年十月到今年五月中旬为止，共有七十名侵越美军官兵在日本开小差成功。文章还透露，在日本，目前还建立了帮助美军逃亡的“地下组织”。
    在侵越美军中，厌战情绪日益滋长，士兵不听指挥官命令拒绝打仗的事件，层出不穷，不久以前又有两名反战的侵越美军士兵投奔解放区。这种厌战、反战的情绪已蔓延到美国国内。据美国《前卫》周刊透露，美军内部对侵越战争不满的士兵，经常不顾反动军官的镇压，公开怠勤、反抗命令或使用武力来对付军官；有的士兵还建立自己的组织和出版报纸，揭露美国侵越罪行。一些被征入伍的青年不愿到南越去送死，甚至不惜采用切除脾脏等办法以求得免服兵役。（附图片）
