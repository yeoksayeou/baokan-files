The struggle of the people of Latin America against dictatorship and for the right to live has seen new developments in the past month.

In Argentina, sugar workers in Tucumán province went on strike on July 11 to protest the brutal suppression by the Onganía military dictatorship of workers and students who participated in the anti-dictatorship demonstration on June 28. The strike by sugar workers received support from university students nationwide. On the same day, students in Córdoba, Córdoba province, held a rally to strongly condemn the police violence and expressed their determination to continue the struggle against the Onganía military dictatorship.

In Colombia, 3,500 teachers in Santander province have been on strike since late June to protest the dismissal of 27 teachers from Santander University and demand their immediate reinstatement. However, their demands have not been met. On July 6, the Colombian Teachers' Union issued a statement supporting the teachers' demands and protesting the government's failure to pay teachers' salaries. The union also declared a state of emergency for all teachers nationwide to prepare for a nationwide strike to protest the government's persecution of teachers.

On June 24, miners from the "Siglo XX" mine, the "Vanuco" mine, and other mines in Bolivia held a grand memorial meeting at the "Siglo XX" mine to commemorate the miners who were killed by the Barrientos military dictatorship a year ago. The miners vowed to continue their struggle against the Barrientos reactionary regime with greater resolve, following in the footsteps of their fallen comrades.

Recently, municipal employees in San Pedro Sula, the second-largest city in Honduras, went on strike to protest the dismissal of municipal employees. The strikers blocked the streets leading to the municipal building and controlled the supply of food and water to the capital, Tegucigalpa. This strike, which erupted just before U.S. President Johnson's visit to the country, caused great alarm among the Honduran authorities.

Recently, hundreds of farmers in Ecuador, carrying machetes and placards, marched through the main streets of Guayaquil, the country's largest city, to protest the government's fake land reform and demand that land be given to farmers without compensation. After the march, the farmers held a protest meeting in front of the provincial government building in Guayas province, where Guayaquil is located.

    拉美人民反独裁斗争继续发展
    阿根廷工人学生并肩战斗反抗独裁政府镇压，哥伦比亚三千多教师罢教抗议当局迫害，厄瓜多尔农民示威反对政府假土改
    新华社十一日讯　近一个月来，拉丁美洲一些国家的人民群众反对独裁统治、争取生活权利的正义斗争有了新的发展。
    阿根廷图库曼省糖业工人一日举行罢工，抗议翁加尼亚军事独裁政权出动警察残酷镇压参加六月二十八日的人民反独裁示威游行的工人和学生。糖业工人的这次罢工得到全国大学生的声援。科尔多瓦省科尔多瓦市的大学生一日也举行集会，强烈谴责警察的暴行，并表示要继续为反对翁加尼亚军事独裁政权而进行斗争。
    哥伦比亚桑坦德省的三千五百名教师从六月下旬起就开始罢教，抗议当局无理解雇桑坦德大学的二十七名教师，要求立即恢复这些教师的工作。但是，上述要求一直没有得到答复。六日，哥伦比亚教师联合会发表公报支持桑坦德省教师的要求，同时抗议政府拖欠教师的工资。这个联合会还宣布全国教师处于紧急状态，以便举行全国性罢教来抗议政府对教师的迫害。
    六月二十四日，玻利维亚“二十世纪”矿、瓦努尼矿和其他矿的矿工在“二十世纪”矿举行盛大的纪念会，悼念一年前被巴里恩托斯军事独裁当局枪杀的矿工。矿工们表示要踏着死难烈士的血迹，更加坚决地同巴里恩托斯反动政权进行斗争。
    中美洲洪都拉斯第二大城市圣彼德罗苏拉的市政雇员不久以前举行罢工，抗议当局无理解雇市政雇员。罢工者封锁了通向市政大厦的街道，并且控制着对首都特古西加尔巴供应食品和水的部门。由于这次罢工是在美帝头子约翰逊“访问”这个国家之前爆发的，因此使得洪都拉斯当局十分惊慌。
    厄瓜多尔数百名农民不久以前举着砍刀和标语牌，在厄瓜多尔第一大城市瓜亚基尔的主要街道上举行示威游行，反对目前政府所实行的假土改，要求把土地无偿地交给农民。示威游行结束后，农民们还在瓜亚基尔所在的瓜亚斯省省政府门前举行抗议集会。
