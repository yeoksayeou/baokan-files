The revolutionary modern Beijing opera model play "Taking Tigers Mountain by Strategy" is a brilliant play that shines with the radiance of Mao Zedong Thought. It vividly portrays an heroic collective that is infinitely loyal to the proletarian revolutionary cause and to the great leader Chairman Mao, educating us profoundly.

Efforts to create heroic images of workers, peasants, and soldiers, and to educate the people with the communist spirit of heroic figures, inspiring the people to move forward, is the fundamental task of proletarian revolutionary literature and art. The Yang Zhirong in "Taking Tigers Mountain by Strategy" is a brilliant proletarian hero. His brave act of entering the tiger's den alone shows his loyalty to the revolutionary cause, and displays the broad communist heart and extraordinary wisdom of a revolutionary fighter. It demonstrates a great truth: the great Mao Zedong Thought is the sunlight and rain that nurtures proletarian heroes, an inexhaustible source of strength to overcome all difficulties and hardships. With Mao Zedong Thought, one can be invincible, and defeat all enemies without being subdued. Those armed with Mao Zedong Thought are the greatest fighting force. Yang Zhirong is able to "endure the severe cold and melt the ice and snow" because he has "a sun in his heart." When he went up the mountain to fight the tiger alone, he thought of "wishing the red flag to wave over the five continents and four seas." Therefore, he had the courage to "rush forward even if it were a sea of fire and a mountain of knives"; he could "face the ferocious flames of the mountain tiger" and "fight the demon for the people" with "strong will and strength." These words full of the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought truly reflect Yang Zhirong's spiritual world. Facing such a towering revolutionary hero, we are moved, our fighting spirit is high, and we feel an endless surge of strength. We wish we could step to Yang Zhirong's side and fight with him, to eliminate the evil tiger and liberate the people of Jiepi Gorge.

Yang Zhirong is a hero who is armed with Mao Zedong Thought and rooted in the masses. In recent years, many advanced figures in our troops have emerged in the practice of creating excellent units. They are all nurtured by Mao Zedong Thought. In a battle to shoot down an American F-104 fighter jet, Comrade Gao Xiang, with his loyalty to our great leader Chairman Mao, hatred for the imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries, and remembering Chairman Mao's teachings on close combat to annihilate the enemy, had the courage and wisdom to dare to engage in aerial hand-to-hand combat with the enemy, blowing up the American air pirate in mid-air. In the battle to sink the Kuomintang's "Tujiang" warship and the naval battle east of Chongwu, all our comrades on the boat studied and applied Mao Zedong Thought, using a small boat to sink the enemy's large ship, achieving a brilliant victory. The common point between the heroic figures in our actual life and Yang Zhirong is their infinite loyalty to Chairman Mao, to Mao Zedong Thought, and to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. They fear neither hardship nor death. For the people's interests, they can reach for the moon in the sky and catch the turtles in the sea, facing all difficulties without turning back, dedicating their red hearts to the Party.

Watching "Taking Tigers Mountain by Strategy," we had a class on Mao Zedong Thought education, further strengthening our infinite love and loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, to the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, and to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. It greatly inspired our revolutionary spirit to fight for the liberation of the laboring people of the whole world. We must remember Chairman Mao's teachings, care about state affairs, and carry the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat to the end. We must carry out a thorough and prolonged revolutionary criticism, thoroughly uproot the counter-revolutionary revisionist literary and art black line, and resolutely defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary literary and art line. Let the heroic images of workers, peasants, and soldiers armed with Mao Zedong Thought forever and firmly occupy all literary and art positions!

    毛泽东思想育英雄

    革命现代京剧样板戏《智取威虎山》，是一出闪耀着毛泽东思想光辉的好戏。它生动地表现了一个无限忠于无产阶级革命事业，无限忠于伟大领袖毛主席的英雄集体，使我们受到极其深刻的教育。
    努力塑造工农兵的英雄形象，用英雄人物的共产主义精神教育人民，鼓舞人民前进，这是无产阶级革命文艺的根本任务。《智取威虎山》中的杨子荣，是一个光辉的无产阶级英雄形象。他单枪匹马深入虎穴的英勇行为，表现了对革命事业的赤胆忠心，表现了革命战士的宽广的共产主义胸怀和惊人的智慧。它向我们显示了一个伟大的真理：伟大的毛泽东思想是无产阶级英雄人物成长的阳光雨露，是战胜任何艰难困苦的取之不尽的力量源泉。掌握了毛泽东思想，就能无往而不胜，就能压倒一切敌人，而不被敌人所屈服。用毛泽东思想武装起来的人，是最大的战斗力。杨子荣所以能“抗严寒化冰雪”，就因为他“胸有朝阳”。他在单枪匹马打虎上山时，心里想的是“愿红旗五洲四海齐招展”。因此，他就有“那怕是火海刀山也扑上前”的勇气；他就能“任凭那座山雕凶焰万丈”，“为人民战恶魔”“志壮力强”。这些迸发着毛泽东思想光辉的豪言壮语，是杨子荣精神世界的真实反映。面对这样一位顶天立地的革命英雄，我们心情激动，斗志昂扬，浑身增加了无穷无尽的力量。我们恨不得一步跨到杨子荣身旁，和他一起战斗，消灭万恶的座山雕，解放夹皮沟的广大人民群众。
    杨子荣是用毛泽东思想武装起来的、扎根于人民群众的英雄。几年来，我们部队在创造四好连队的实践中，涌现出来的许多先进人物，也都是在毛泽东思想哺育下成长起来的。在一次击落美帝歼击机Ｆ—104的战斗中，高翔同志正是怀着对我们伟大领袖毛主席的赤胆忠心，带着对帝、修、反的刻骨仇恨，牢记毛主席近战歼敌的教导，才有那么大的勇气和智慧，敢于和敌人空中拚刺刀，把美国飞贼打了个空中开花。在击沉蒋匪“沱江”号军舰和崇武以东海战中，我们全艇同志活学活用毛泽东思想，以小艇击沉敌人的大舰，取得了辉煌的胜利。我们实际生活中的英雄人物和杨子荣的共同点，就是无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于毛泽东思想，无限忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。他们不怕苦，不怕死，为了人民利益，可上九天揽月，可下五洋捉鳖，千难万险不回头，一颗红心献给党。
    看了《智取威虎山》，我们上了一堂毛泽东思想教育课，使我们进一步增强了对伟大领袖毛主席、对战无不胜的毛泽东思想和毛主席的革命路线的无限热爱，无限忠诚；大大激发了我们为全世界劳动人民翻身求解放的革命精神。我们一定要牢记毛主席的教导，关心国家大事，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。我们一定要深入持久地开展革命的大批判，彻底铲除反革命修正主义文艺黑线，坚决捍卫毛主席的革命文艺路线。让毛泽东思想武装起来的工农兵英雄形象永远地、牢牢地占领一切文艺阵地！
