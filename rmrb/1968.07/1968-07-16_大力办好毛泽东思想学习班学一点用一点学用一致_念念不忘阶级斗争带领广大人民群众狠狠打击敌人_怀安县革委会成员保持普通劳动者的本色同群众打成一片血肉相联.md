The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "The reform of state organs, the most fundamental point, is to link up with the masses." Under the assistance of the PLA's leftist cadres, the Huai'an County Revolutionary Committee in Hebei Province has followed Chairman Mao's teachings, inherited and carried forward the Party's fine tradition of close ties with the masses, and established a flesh-and-blood relationship with the broad revolutionary masses. Over the past year, they have realized from practice that: to establish close ties with the broad masses, the revolutionary committee must run Mao Zedong Thought study classes to arm the masses with Mao Zedong Thought, must lead the masses to resolutely strike the enemy, and must always maintain the character of ordinary laborers.

The revolutionary masses love Chairman Mao the most, love Mao Zedong Thought the most, and listen to Chairman Mao's words the most. The revolutionary committee—only by placing the active study and application of Mao Zedong Thought at the forefront of all work, continuously arming the masses with Mao Zedong Thought, and timely, accurately, and comprehensively implementing the battle tasks and policies of the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, can it unify the thoughts and actions of the broad masses.

Every time the great leader Chairman Mao issues new instructions, the leading members of the revolutionary committee convey them to the entire county with the greatest enthusiasm and the fastest speed, ensuring their implementation. The county revolutionary committee has organized several times a ten-thousand-strong Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team consisting of revolutionary workers, PLA soldiers, Red Guards, and cadre members, led by the leading members of the revolutionary committee, to go deep into the countryside and mountain areas to convey Chairman Mao's latest instructions. The members of various levels of revolutionary committees and the broad revolutionary masses welcome Chairman Mao's latest instructions as timely rain and a compass, saying that the county revolutionary committee has brought them the strongest ideological weapon.

After Chairman Mao issued the call to "run study classes, which is a good method, and many problems can be solved in study classes" and "to fight selfishness and criticize revisionism," the leading members of the county revolutionary committee immediately conveyed this throughout the county and went deep into the countryside and grassroots levels to help the broad grassroots cadres and poor and lower-middle peasants run Mao Zedong Thought study classes. When they helped the third brigade of Chai Gou Bu Town run a study class, they guided the poor and lower-middle peasants to seriously study the "Quotations from Chairman Mao," link specific examples, and criticize the counter-revolutionary revisionist fallacies of China's Khrushchev, and fight against selfishness, combining the fight against selfishness with the criticism of revisionism. After the county revolutionary committee summarized and promoted the experience of this brigade throughout the county, it promoted the ideological revolutionization of the broad masses and promoted the great alliance and the three-in-one combination of the revolution. Now, the county has run over 45,000 sessions of various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes. County-run, commune-run, and household-run study classes are spread throughout the county. In the study classes, revolutionary cadres and masses have carried forward the revolutionary learning style advocated by Chairman Mao, learning a little and using a little, on the one hand deeply criticizing the counter-revolutionary revisionist fallacies of China's Khrushchev, and on the other hand thoroughly criticizing the bourgeois "self" and establishing the proletarian "public," causing a revolution in the depths of their souls and continuously promoting the revolutionization of people's thoughts. The broad revolutionary masses say: In the past, a handful of capitalist roaders promoted the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of China's Khrushchev, only focusing on work and production, attempting to lead us astray. As soon as the revolutionary committee was established, it focused on the active study and application of Mao Zedong Thought and the ideological revolutionization of people, making our eyes bright and our direction clear, with one heart following Chairman Mao to make the revolution.

The members of the revolutionary committee went deep into the masses and studied and applied Mao Zedong Thought with the masses, which greatly promoted the work of grabbing the revolution and promoting production in various units. Not long ago, Deputy Director Wang Youwei of the county revolutionary committee went to the water ditch village of Chai Gou Bu Commune to stay and found that the production of this village was relatively tight, but the revolutionary criticism was somewhat relaxed. He had a discussion with the grassroots cadres and poor and lower-middle peasants. He asked, "Why has this poor mountain changed so much? It is not relying on heaven, not relying on the earth, but relying on the great leader Chairman Mao. With the red sun in our hearts, people change their thoughts and the earth changes its clothes." Wang Youwei said, "Yes, all our victories are achieved through the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. Chairman Mao teaches us to 'grab the revolution and promote production,' we cannot grab production and relax the revolution!" He then further helped the grassroots cadres and poor and lower-middle peasants study Chairman Mao's teaching of "never forgetting class struggle" and criticized China's Khrushchev's theory of "the extinction of class struggle." The broad grassroots cadres and poor and lower-middle peasants raised their awareness of class struggle and two-line struggle, setting up revolutionary criticism battlefields on kangs, streets, and fields, and criticizing China's Khrushchev's spread of "three selfs and one package" and other revisionist black goods. The entire village achieved the goal of not stopping revolutionary criticism even when farm work was busy, using revolution to lead production and using revolution to promote production. The social awareness of the commune members became higher and higher, and their enthusiasm for collective production became greater and greater.

The new revolutionary power must resolutely protect the broad masses of the people and strike a small number of class enemies. The revolutionary committee—only by leading the masses to resolutely strike the enemy can it represent the interests of the broad masses of the people.

The great leader Chairman Mao recently pointed out profoundly: "Whether to protect or suppress the broad masses of the people is the fundamental difference between the Communist Party and the Kuomintang, the fundamental difference between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, and the fundamental difference between the dictatorship of the proletariat and the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie." As soon as this latest instruction from Chairman Mao was conveyed, the members of the county revolutionary committee and the PLA's leftist cadres immediately studied it repeatedly and discussed the history of the revolutionary committee's consolidation and development over the past year. Everyone realized that an important task of the proletarian revolutionary power is to protect the broad masses of the people and strike a small number of class enemies. While a handful of class enemies, in order to save their dying fate and achieve restoration, are constantly attacking the revolutionary committee and the broad revolutionary masses. Therefore, the revolutionary committee must actively lead the broad masses of the people to launch a fierce attack on the class enemies, in order to protect the broad masses of the people and represent the interests of the broad masses of the people.

This spring, in the midst of a good situation throughout the county, some comrades developed a sense of complacency and underestimation, believing that a handful of capitalist roaders had been overthrown, and the remaining few enemies were like "autumn locusts and legless frogs, with no more jumping power." Therefore, they did not see that the class enemies were secretly carrying out sabotage. In response to these active thoughts, the county revolutionary committee, with the help of the PLA's leftist cadres, widely ran Mao Zedong Thought study classes on the theme of "never forgetting class struggle," organizing members of various levels of revolutionary committees and the broad masses to study Chairman Mao's great teachings on class and class struggle, and study Chairman Mao's latest instruction: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is essentially a great political revolution carried out by the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes under the conditions of socialism, a continuation of the long-term struggle between the Communist Party of China and its leadership and the broad revolutionary people and the Kuomintang reactionaries, and a continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie." Everyone, with Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, analyzed the new trends of class struggle and clearly saw the more hidden and cunning means adopted by a handful of unrepentant capitalist roaders, traitors, spies, and untransformed landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists. After raising their awareness, the revolutionary masses throughout the county launched a fierce attack on the class enemies, exposing some hidden class enemies.

In the struggle against the enemy, the members of the county revolutionary committee went to the front line of class struggle, acting as both fighters and commanders, mobilizing the masses to launch a fierce attack on the class enemies. Deputy Director Liu Qingwen of the county revolutionary committee, with a backpack, went to Wang Hu Tun Commune in the deep mountains, where a handful of capitalist roaders had never been. In this village, because the masses had not been fully mobilized, the activities of class enemies were still quite rampant. He organized the masses to study Chairman Mao's teachings on class and class struggle, conducted class education, carried out bitter-sweet remembrance activities, and raised the class struggle awareness and two-line struggle awareness of the masses. The masses quickly mobilized and criticized a bad element known as the "mountain tyrant."

In the process of attacking the class enemies, the county revolutionary committee led the broad masses to strictly distinguish between the two types of contradictions, seriously implement the Party's policies, and accurately and resolutely strike the enemy. After the cleanup of class ranks began, some units did not fully implement the Party's policies. The county revolutionary committee specially ran a study class and held a political work meeting, organizing everyone to study policies and exchange experiences. In this way, it united all revolutionary forces that could be united and, to the greatest extent, isolated and struck a small number of class enemies.

We, all working cadres, regardless of our position, are servants of the people. The members of the revolutionary committee—only by maintaining the character of ordinary laborers can they be heart to heart with the broad masses of the people.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "All our working cadres, regardless of their position, are servants of the people." The comrades of the Huai'an County Revolutionary Committee believe that the members of the revolutionary committee must correctly handle their relationship with the masses, always regard themselves as ordinary laborers, and always be servants of the people.

The members of the revolutionary committee generally often go deep into the masses and contact the masses in the attitude of ordinary laborers. During the busy spring plowing and summer weeding seasons this year, the members of the county revolutionary committee, except for leaving one deputy director to handle daily work, were led by the director to go deep into the grassroots level and the production front line with backpacks, studying, eating, living, and working with the poor and lower-middle peasants, fighting against selfishness and criticizing revisionism together, and grabbing the revolution and promoting production together. They especially paid attention to the most difficult communes and brigades, conducted investigations and research on the spot, listened to the opinions of the poor and lower-middle peasants, and helped the masses solve problems. Military representative and standing committee member of the county revolutionary committee, Zhang Jilü, went to Xisha City Commune Xisha City Brigade to stay and study Chairman Mao's works with the commune members every day and helped them carry water and fight drought. The original plan of the commune revolutionary committee was to spend half a month to build an irrigation canal. After Zhang Jilü knew this, he helped them run a study class and conducted in-depth and detailed ideological and political work, making the number of people attending far exceed the original plan. As a result, in less than two days, the irrigation canal was built. The poor and lower-middle peasants said, "Old Zhang brought us the style of the old Eighth Route Army."

To implement Chairman Mao's teachings on linking up with the masses, the Huai'an County Revolutionary Committee often adopts methods such as holding investigation meetings, symposiums, and individual talks to actively solicit the opinions of the masses and continuously improve work methods and styles. In late April this year, the leading members of the county revolutionary committee again went to the masses to solicit opinions. While affirming the achievements of the revolutionary committee, the broad revolutionary masses also sincerely criticized and made suggestions to the revolutionary committee. They talked about some members of the revolutionary committee having a style that was not deep enough and being somewhat distant from the masses. The county revolutionary committee conducted a self-examination and found that some comrades did not want to go to the front line to do painstaking and detailed work and liked to float on the surface; some comrades had contracted "officialdom" and sometimes appeared with the attitude of a "leader" when going down. The county revolutionary committee ran Mao Zedong Thought study classes, studied the "Three Constantly Read Articles," studied Chairman Mao's teachings of "being both an 'official' and a common person," and carried out the struggle against selfishness and criticism of revisionism. Everyone further realized: The position has changed, but the character of an ordinary laborer must never change.

    大力办好毛泽东思想学习班学一点用一点学用一致
    念念不忘阶级斗争带领广大人民群众狠狠打击敌人
    怀安县革委会成员保持普通劳动者的本色同群众打成一片血肉相联
    本报讯　伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“国家机关的改革，最根本的一条，就是联系群众。”河北省怀安县革命委员会在解放军支左人员的帮助下，遵循毛主席的教导，继承和发扬党的紧密联系群众的优良作风，和广大革命群众建立了血肉相联的关系。一年多来，他们从实践中体会到：革命委员会要同广大群众建立紧密的联系，必须大办毛泽东思想学习班，用毛泽东思想武装群众，必须带领群众狠狠打击阶级敌人，必须永远保持普通劳动者的本色。
      革命群众最热爱毛主席，最热爱
    毛泽东思想，最听毛主席的话。
    革命委员会——
          只有用毛泽东思想去武装群众
          才能同广大群众取得密切联系
    怀安县革委会从一年多的实践中体会到：广大人民群众最热爱毛主席，最热爱毛泽东思想，最听毛主席的话。革命委员会只有坚持把活学活用毛泽东思想放在一切工作的首位，不断地用毛泽东思想去武装群众，及时地准确地全面地把以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的战斗任务和方针政策，落实到群众中去，才能统一广大群众的思想和行动。
    每当伟大领袖毛主席发出最新指示，革委会的领导成员都以最大的热情、最快的速度，迅速向全县人民传达，切实贯彻执行。县革委会几次组织有革命工人、解放军战士、红卫兵小将和机关干部参加的万人毛泽东思想宣传队，由革委会领导成员带领，深入到农村和山区，传达毛主席的最新指示。各级革命委员会的成员和广大革命群众，欢呼毛主席的最新指示是及时雨，是方向盘，说县革委会给他们送去了最强大的思想武器。
    毛主席发出“办学习班，是个好办法，很多问题可以在学习班得到解决”和“要斗私，批修”的伟大号召以后，县革委会的领导成员立即在全县传达，并且深入农村，深入基层，帮助广大基层干部和贫下中农大办毛泽东思想学习班。他们在帮助柴沟堡镇第三大队办学习班时，引导贫下中农认真学习《毛主席语录》，联系具体事例，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义谬论，狠斗私心，把斗私和批修紧密结合起来。县革委会把这个大队的经验总结推广到全县以后，促进了广大群众的思想革命化，促进了革命的大联合和革命的三结合。现在，全县共办各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班四万五千多期。县办、社队办、院户办的各种学习班遍及全县。在学习班里，广大革命干部和革命群众，发扬毛主席亲自倡导的革命好学风，学一点，用一点，一方面深入批判中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义谬论，一方面大破资产阶级“私”字，大立无产阶级“公”字，在灵魂深处爆发革命，不断促进人的思想革命化。广大革命群众说：过去，一小撮走资派推行中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义路线，只抓业务，只抓生产，妄图把我们引上邪路。革命委员会一成立，就狠抓活学活用毛泽东思想，搞好人的思想革命化，使我们眼睛亮，方向明，一个心眼跟着毛主席干革命。
    县革委会的成员深入群众之中，和群众一起活学活用毛泽东思想，对于各单位抓革命、促生产起了很大促进作用。不久以前，县革委会副主任王有维到柴沟堡公社水壕洼大队蹲点，发现这个大队生产抓得比较紧，革命大批判有些放松，他就同基层干部和贫下中农座谈。他问：“咱们这个穷山沟的变化这么大，靠的是什么？”贫下中农说：“不靠天，不靠地，靠的是伟大领袖毛主席。心中有了红太阳，人换思想地换装。”王有维说：“对呀，我们的一切胜利，都是靠战无不胜的毛泽东思想得来的。毛主席教导我们要‘抓革命，促生产’，我们可不能抓了生产放松革命啊！”接着，他又进一步帮助基层干部和贫下中农学习毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的教导，批判中国赫鲁晓夫的
  “阶级斗争熄灭”论。广大基层干部和贫下中农提高了阶级斗争觉悟和两条路线斗争觉悟，在炕头、街头、地头大摆革命大批判的战场，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫散布的“三自一包”等修正主义黑货。全大队做到了农活再忙，革命大批判不停，用革命统帅生产，用革命带动生产。社员们的社会主义觉悟越来越高，搞好集体生产的劲头也越来越大。
      新生的革命政权要坚决保护广大
    人民群众，打击极少数阶级敌人。
    革命委员会——
          只有带领群众狠狠地打击敌人
          才能代表广大人民群众的利益
    伟大领袖毛主席最近深刻地指出：“对广大人民群众是保护还是镇压，是共产党同国民党的根本区别，是无产阶级同资产阶级的根本区别，是无产阶级专政同资产阶级专政的根本区别。”毛主席这一最新指示一传来，县革委会成员和解放军支左人员就立即反复学习，并且联系一年多来革委会巩固发展的历史作了讨论。大家认识到，无产阶级革命政权的重要任务，是保护广大人民群众，打击极少数阶级敌人。而一小撮阶级敌人为了挽救其垂死的命运，达到复辟的目的，无时无刻不在向革命委员会和广大革命群众进攻。因此，革委会只有主动带领广大人民群众向阶级敌人猛烈进攻，才能保护广大人民群众，才能代表广大人民群众的利益。
    今年春天，在全县一片大好形势下，有的同志产生了麻痹轻敌思想，认为一小撮走资派被打倒了，剩下几个敌人不过是“秋后的蚂蚱、断腿的蛙，没有多大蹦哒头了”，因而看不到阶级敌人正在暗中进行破坏。针对这些活思想，县革委会在解放军支左人员的帮助下，广泛举办了以“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”为题的毛泽东思想学习班，组织各级革委会成员和广大群众学习毛主席关于阶级和阶级斗争的伟大教导，学习毛主席的最新指示：“无产阶级文化大革命，实质上是在社会主义条件下，无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命，是中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续，是无产阶级和资产阶级阶级斗争的继续。”大家以毛泽东思想为武器，分析阶级斗争的新动向，清楚地看到一小撮顽固不化的走资派、叛徒、特务以及没有改造好的地、富、反、坏、右分子所采取的更隐蔽、更狡猾的手段。认识提高以后，全县革命群众向阶级敌人展开猛攻，揭露出一些暗藏的阶级敌人。
    在对敌斗争中，县革委会成员深入阶级斗争第一线，既当战斗员，又当指挥员，放手发动群众，向阶级敌人展开猛烈的进攻。县革委会副主任刘庆文背着背包，来到旧县委内一小撮走资派从来没有到过的深山区王虎屯公社魏家山大队。这个大队由于群众没有充分发动起来，阶级敌人的活动还相当猖狂。他便组织群众学习毛主席关于阶级和阶级斗争的教导，进行阶级教育，开展忆苦思甜活动，提高群众的阶级斗争觉悟和两条路线斗争觉悟。群众很快发动起来，批斗了一个被群众称为“山霸”的坏分子。
    在向阶级敌人进攻过程中，县革委会带领广大群众严格区别两类不同性质的矛盾，认真执行党的方针政策，稳、准、狠地打击敌人。清理阶级队伍工作开始以后，有的单位落实党的政策不够。县革委会就专门举办了学习班，召开了政治工作会议，组织大家学习政策，交流经验。这样，就团结了一切可以团结的革命力量，最大限度地孤立和打击了一小撮阶级敌人。
      我们一切工作干部，不论职位高低，都
    是人民的勤务员。革命委员会成员——
        只有保持普通劳动者的本色
        才能和广大人民群众心连心
    毛主席教导我们：“我们一切工作干部，不论职位高低，都是人民的勤务员”。怀安县革命委员会的同志认为，革委会成员要密切联系群众，必须摆正自己同群众的关系，永远把自己当成一个普通劳动者，永远做人民的勤务员。
    县革委会的成员一般都能经常深入群众，以普通劳动者的姿态去联系群众。今年春耕、夏锄大忙季节，县革委会成员除留一名副主任主持日常工作外，由主任带头，全部背着背包深入基层，深入生产第一线，和贫下中农同学习、同吃、同住、同劳动，一起斗私批修，一起抓革命促生产。他们特别注意到困难最多的社队去，亲自调查研究，听取贫下中农的意见，帮助群众解决问题。军队代表、县革委会常委张继禄，到西沙城公社西沙城大队去蹲点，天天和社员一起学习毛主席著作，一起担水抗旱。公社革委会原计划用半个月的时间修一条水渠，张继禄知道后，就帮助他们办了一期学习班，进行深入细致的思想政治工作，使出勤人数大大超过原来的计划数字。结果，不到两天时间就把水渠修成了。贫下中农说：“老张给我们带来了老八路的作风。”
    怀安县革委会为了贯彻执行毛主席关于联系群众的教导，经常采取开调查会、座谈会，以及个别谈心等方式，主动征求群众的意见，不断改进工作方法和工作作风。今年四月下旬，县革委会领导成员又到群众中征求了意见。广大革命群众在肯定革委会的工作成绩的同时，也诚恳地对革委会提出了一些批评和建议。他们谈到有的革委会成员作风不够深入，跟群众的关系有些疏远。县革委会作了检查，发现有的同志不愿意到第一线去做艰苦细致的工作，喜欢浮在上边；有的同志沾染了“官气”，到下边去有时以“领导者”的姿态出现。县革委会举办毛泽东思想学习班，学习“老三篇”，学习毛主席“既当‘官’，又当老百姓”的教导，开展斗私批修。大家进一步认识到：职务变了，普通劳动者的本色永远不能变。
                                    （齐向东）
