July 1st marked the 47th anniversary of the founding of our great, glorious, and correct Communist Party of China, and it was also the happiest and most unforgettable day for us. On this day, I, along with colleagues from the Beijing Opera Troupe such as Qian Haoliang and Liu Changyu, performed the piano accompaniment to "The Red Lantern" for our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin and other central leaders. We were also graciously received by Chairman Mao. This is a manifestation of the warm care and great encouragement from the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin. Our hearts were filled with immense excitement, and we couldn't help but feel our blood boiling and tears welling up. The piano, which had served the bourgeoisie for hundreds of years, has finally been liberated and gained a new life, serving the proletariat and the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers. This was our long-cherished wish, and today, under the brilliant guidance of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line on literature and art, it has finally been realized. How could we not be overjoyed?

In the past few days, I and my comrades have been completely immersed in happiness. At this moment of joy, reflecting on the path we have traveled, we feel even more deeply that the birth of the piano accompaniment to "The Red Lantern" is a victory for Chairman Mao's revolutionary line on literature and art; it is a victory for Chairman Mao's great policy of "using foreign things to serve China and innovating"; it is a fruitful result cultivated under the diligent guidance of Comrade Jiang Qing.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The growth of any new thing is bound to be fraught with difficulties and twists and turns." The growth of the piano accompaniment to revolutionary modern Beijing opera, this new thing, has also been a bumpy road, experiencing fierce struggles between the two classes, two lines, and two roads.

The piano, which the bourgeoisie has hailed as the "king of music" and the "jewel in the crown of musical art," is a stronghold of Western instruments. For hundreds of years, it has been monopolized by the bourgeoisie, serving the bourgeoisie's masters and mistresses. Almost all the themes performed were reactionary subjects such as life and death, love and hate, demons and ghosts, graves, and gallows, propagating the decadent and corrupt thoughts and feelings of the bourgeoisie. After liberation, China's Khrushchev and his agents in the literary and artistic circles vigorously promoted the ideas of worshipping foreign things and reviving old customs, allowing the bourgeoisie to continue occupying the piano art front, vigorously peddling the goods of fame, foreignness, and antiquity, and feudalism, capitalism, and revisionism, making the piano a tool for China's Khrushchev to restore capitalism; and using overseas competitions and fame as bait, corrupting young students and young musicians. For more than a decade, the revisionist elements in the literary and artistic circles have used the reactionary artistic views of the bourgeoisie and the works of dead foreigners to poison my soul, using overseas competitions and gold medals to corrupt my thoughts, attempting to make me a sacrificial offering to bourgeois piano art.

Through studying Chairman Mao's works and going deep among the workers, peasants, and soldiers, my thoughts and feelings began to change. We often discussed this issue with our comrades: "Can the piano serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers? How can the piano serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers?" We thought: "The piano is an instrument created by the working people. Why can't it serve the working people, serve proletarian politics, and serve socialism?" Chairman Mao's brilliant thought of "using foreign things to serve China and innovating" illuminated our hearts. My comrades and I made up our minds to carry out a piano revolution, making it truly serve proletarian politics and the workers, peasants, and soldiers.

The great victory of the Beijing opera revolution shocked the world like a spring thunder, adding boundless strength and courage to our piano revolution. We thought: Revolutionary artists armed with Mao Zedong Thought, under the leadership of Comrade Jiang Qing, can even break through the most stubborn stronghold of Beijing opera. Then what other old strongholds can't be broken through? Inspired by the great victory of the Beijing opera revolution, starting from 1964, my comrades and I made some explorations on how the piano can serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and adapted some revolutionary mass songs and folk songs familiar to the masses. However, even these small attempts were met with all kinds of obstruction and sabotage by a handful of counter-revolutionary revisionist elements in the literary and artistic circles. The counter-revolutionary revisionist Lin Mohan said to me: "You are playing the piano too tensely and strongly now. You should do more lyrical pieces." Those reactionary academic "authorities" also jumped out one by one, criticizing me, saying things like, "Don't follow them in making trouble. Practice your piano well. If you want to create, you must learn the four essentials (i.e., harmony, form, polyphony, and orchestration, a whole set of foreign frameworks)." However, this series of criticisms and curses did not shake our revolutionary resolve. We firmly believe that the piano is just a tool. As long as the person who masters the piano implements Chairman Mao's revolutionary line on literature and art, it can completely serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers and be welcomed by them.

On January 27, 1965, our beloved Comrade Jiang Qing, with the warm care of the great leader Chairman Mao and the earnest expectations of the proletarian headquarters, personally came to the Central Orchestra. Comrade Jiang Qing listened to the performances of various instruments and carefully understood the characteristics of various instruments. She warmly encouraged everyone, saying: "The weapons are very good. I think they can completely serve the people and serve the revolution." Comrade Jiang Qing pointed out incisively: "We cannot follow the 'foreigners' to die. We must walk our own path." Comrade Jiang Qing's series of important instructions ignited the blazing flames of the symphony revolution and also pointed out an endless bright future for Western instruments. Under the brilliant guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, directly led by Comrade Jiang Qing, the revolutionary musicians of the orchestra bravely fought, breaking through numerous obstacles, and the revolutionary symphony "Sangzhan Lake" was finally premiered on National Day in 1965. The success of the revolutionary symphony "Sangzhan Lake" gave us great enlightenment. I had the idea of using the piano to perform Beijing opera and began to try it out on the piano. In early 1966, I proposed to the old party committee of the orchestra to go to the banks of Lake Sangzhan with the creation team of "Sangzhan Lake" to experiment with using the piano to perform "Sangzhan Lake." However, the counter-revolutionary revisionist elements who controlled the old party committee of the orchestra flatly rejected my request and instead wanted me to create soft and gloomy music.

Under the great situation of the Cultural Revolution's continuous victories, in April last year, we finally heard Comrade Jiang Qing's instructions on the piano accompanying revolutionary modern Beijing opera, which she had made as early as 1964. Such an important instruction was blocked by a handful of counter-revolutionary revisionist elements for as long as two and a half years. Comrade Jiang Qing's instructions pointed out the direction for us and gave us great spiritual strength. We decided to follow Comrade Jiang Qing's instructions and blaze a trail in the piano accompanying revolutionary modern Beijing opera.

In May last year, to welcome the 25th anniversary of the publication of our great leader Chairman Mao's brilliant work "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," our troupe organized a Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team to perform on the streets. For the first time, we took the piano to the streets. In the vast and majestic Tiananmen Square, my colleague and I from the orchestra performed the segment "Reproach the Enemy" from "Sangzhan Lake" for the workers, peasants, and soldiers. Our initial attempt was warmly welcomed. The broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers excitedly said: "The piano is created by the working people and should serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers. In the past, we couldn't understand what the piano played, but today it plays revolutionary modern Beijing opera, so the piano has been liberated." An old worker excitedly said: "I started working at the age of eleven. In the past, I couldn't understand the piano, but today the piano performs revolutionary modern Beijing opera, and I can understand it. This is the wisdom and greatness of Chairman Mao. I want to shout a thousand and ten thousand times: Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand times long live!" The broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers fully affirmed our initial attempt, giving us great encouragement and urging. It also made us realize that only by following Chairman Mao's teachings of "using foreign things to serve China and innovating" and Comrade Jiang Qing's instructions on accompanying revolutionary modern Beijing opera, and walking the path of Beijing opera revolution, can we find the correct direction.

However, the road of revolution is tortuous. The representatives of the counter-revolutionary revisionist literary and artistic black line and the reactionary academic "authorities" were not willing to admit their defeat. They put on a face of extreme "leftism," fanning the flames and spreading fallacies, saying things like "the piano is guilty, and the person is more guilty," claiming to "smash the piano." They stirred up a strong wind of "doubt everything, negate everything," attempting to muddy the waters and shake our revolutionary resolve. However, with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as our weapon and the support of our beloved Comrade Jiang Qing, we fear neither heaven nor earth. Our revolutionary resolve is firm, and the enemy's attacks and sabotage are in vain. With the enthusiastic help and strong support of the revolutionary comrades of the Beijing Opera Troupe, starting from May last year, we began to seriously study and research the singing segments and accompaniments of "The Red Lantern." The towering images of Li Yuhe, Li Tiemei, and Li Delai inspired us, and we had an urgent desire to express them and sing their praises with the piano. After several months of hard work, my colleague Liu Changyu and I created several segments of Li Tiemei's piano accompaniment from "The Red Lantern" and performed them for the capital's audience on National Day last year. We also made a recording and reported it to Comrade Jiang Qing. On November 20 last year, Comrade Jiang Qing listened to the recording of the piano accompaniment to "The Red Lantern" amidst her busy schedule and made extremely important instructions. Comrade Jiang Qing pointed out: "This is a good start," and specifically instructed us to continue creating the main singing segments of Li Yuhe, Li Tiemei, and Li Delai, blazing a trail for the piano accompanying revolutionary modern Beijing opera. Comrade Jiang Qing, with her full proletarian revolutionary enthusiasm, fully affirmed this revolutionary new thing, the piano accompaniment to "The Red Lantern," making us feel full of energy. We decided to follow Comrade Jiang Qing tenaciously in the struggle between the two classes, two lines, and two roads. We responded to the great call of our great leader Chairman Mao to "grasp revolution and promote production," participating in the movement while accelerating the learning of revolutionary modern Beijing opera and creation. After several months of continuous practice, in May this year, we completed all the important singing segments of Li Yuhe and Li Tiemei, cooperating with Qian Haoliang and Liu Changyu to make a recording, and reported it to Comrade Jiang Qing again. On the eve of July 1st, our beloved Comrade Jiang Qing and other leaders of the Central Cultural Revolution Group personally received me and Qian Haoliang, Liu Changyu, and other comrades, giving high praise to the piano accompaniment to "The Red Lantern." This is the greatest encouragement and greatest spur for us revolutionary literary and artistic workers from the proletarian headquarters.

Looking back on the past few years of struggle, the birth and growth of the piano accompaniment to "The Red Lantern" has not been separated for a moment from the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, Chairman Mao's revolutionary line on literature and art, and Comrade Jiang Qing's warm care and patient guidance. It is our beloved Comrade Jiang Qing, with her brave spirit of defending Chairman Mao's revolutionary line on literature and art, who has set a brilliant example for us, making us dare to stand against the current and forge ahead. It is our beloved Comrade Jiang Qing, with her humble and rigorous proletarian revolutionary character, who has set a brilliant example for us, making us able to treat artistic practice seriously and strive for perfection in technology. The birth of the piano accompaniment to "The Red Lantern" is only the first step in the piano revolution's ten-thousand-li long march. The work ahead is still arduous and the road is long. We are determined to read Chairman Mao's books for life, walk the revolutionary path for life, temper and transform ourselves in the great winds and waves of class struggle, learn from Comrade Jiang Qing as a brilliant example, and be a revolutionary literary and artistic worker who is forever loyal to Chairman Mao and Chairman Mao's revolutionary line on literature and art, striving to develop new proletarian revolutionary literature and art and achieve new successes.

    以江青同志为光辉榜样，做永远忠于毛主席的革命文艺战士
    中央乐团　殷承宗
    今年七月一日，是我们伟大、光荣、正确的中国共产党诞生四十七周年的光辉节日，也是我们最最幸福的一天，最最难忘的一天。在这一天，我和中国京剧团的钱浩梁、刘长瑜等同志，为我们最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席和他的亲密战友林副主席及其他中央首长演出了钢琴伴唱《红灯记》，并得到了毛主席的亲切接见。这是以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部对我们的亲切关怀、巨大鼓舞。我们的心情万分激动，禁不住热血沸腾，热泪盈眶。钢琴这个几百年来一直为资产阶级服务的乐器，今天终于得到了解放，获得了新生，能为无产阶级、为广大工农兵群众服务了。这是我们多少年来的热切愿望，今天在毛主席革命文艺路线的光辉照耀下，终于实现了，怎能不叫我们欣喜若狂呢！
    几天来，我和我的战友们，完全沉浸在幸福之中。在这幸福的时刻，回顾一下我们走过的道路，更深刻地感受到，钢琴伴唱《红灯记》的诞生，是毛主席革命文艺路线的胜利；是毛主席“洋为中用、推陈出新”伟大方针的胜利；是在江青同志辛勤培育下结出的硕果。
    毛主席教导我们：“任何新生事物的成长都是要经过艰难曲折的。”钢琴为革命现代京剧伴唱这个新生事物的成长道路也同样是不平坦的，也同样是经历了两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的激烈搏斗的。
    钢琴这个被资产阶级捧之为“音乐之王”，“音乐艺术皇冠上的明珠”的乐器，是西洋乐器中的顽固堡垒。几百年来，它一直为资产阶级所垄断，为资产阶级的老爷太太服务。演奏的几乎全部是什么生死、爱恨、妖魔、鬼怪、坟墓、绞架之类的反动主题，宣扬资产阶级腐朽没落的思想感情。解放后，中国赫鲁晓夫及其在文艺界的代理人大肆宣扬崇洋复古，崇外非中的思想，听任资产阶级继续占领钢琴艺术阵地，大力贩卖名、洋、古，封、资、修的货色，使钢琴成为中国赫鲁晓夫复辟资本主义的舆论工具；并以出国比赛，成名成家为诱饵，腐蚀青年学生和青年音乐工作者。十几年来，文艺界的反革命修正主义分子用资产阶级反动的艺术观，用洋死人的“名作”毒害我的灵魂，用出国比赛、金质奖章，腐蚀我的思想，妄图让我做资产阶级钢琴艺术的殉葬品。
    通过学习毛主席著作和深入工农兵，我的思想感情开始发生了变化。我和同志们经常讨论这样一个问题：“钢琴能不能为工农兵服务？钢琴怎样为工农兵服务？”我们想：“钢琴这个乐器，是劳动人民创造出来的，为什么不能为劳动人民服务，为无产阶级政治服务，为社会主义服务呢？”毛主席“洋为中用、推陈出新”的光辉思想照亮了我们的心。我和我的战友们下定决心，要进行钢琴革命，使它真正为无产阶级政治服务，为工农兵服务。
    京剧革命的伟大胜利象一声春雷震惊了世界，为我们进行钢琴革命增添了无穷的力量和勇气。我们想：用毛泽东思想武装起来的革命文艺战士，在江青同志的率领下，京剧这个最顽固的堡垒都可以攻破，那么还有什么旧堡垒不能攻破呢？在京剧革命伟大胜利的鼓舞下，从一九六四年开始，我和我的战友们在钢琴如何为工农兵服务方面做了一些探索，改编了一些革命群众歌曲和群众熟悉的民歌。但是，就是这样一些小小的尝试，却遭到了盘踞在文艺界的一小撮反革命修正主义分子的百般阻挠和破坏。反革命修正主义分子林默涵对我说：“你现在弹琴太紧张太强烈了，你应该多搞些抒情的东西”。那些反动学术“权威”也一个个跳了出来，对我横加指责，说什么“你不要跟着他们去胡闹，好好练你的琴，要创作的话，也得学会四大件（即和声、曲体、复调、配器等一整套洋框框）。”但是，这一连串的指责、咒骂，都没能动摇我和我的同志们革命的决心。我们坚信，钢琴这个乐器只是一个工具，只要掌握钢琴的人贯彻执行毛主席的革命文艺路线，是完全能够为工农兵服务，受工农兵欢迎的。
    一九六五年一月二十七日，我们敬爱的江青同志带着伟大领袖毛主席的亲切关怀，带着无产阶级司令部的殷切期望，亲自来到了中央乐团。江青同志听了各种乐器的演奏，仔细地了解各种乐器的性能，她亲切地鼓励大家说：武器很好嘛，我看完全可以为人民服务，为革命服务。江青同志一针见血地指出：不能跟着“洋人”去死，一定要走自己的路。江青同志的一系列重要指示，点燃了交响乐革命的熊熊烈火，同时也给西洋乐器指出了无限光明的前途。在毛泽东思想光辉照耀下，在江青同志直接率领下，乐团广大革命文艺战士英勇奋战，冲破重重阻力，革命交响音乐《沙家浜》终于在一九六五年国庆节公演了。革命交响音乐《沙家浜》的成功给了我们很大的启示，我产生了用钢琴来演奏京剧的想法，并开始在琴上试弹。一九六六年初我向乐团的旧党委提出要求与《沙家浜》创作组的同志一起到阳澄湖畔深入生活，试验用钢琴来演奏《沙家浜》。但是，把持乐团旧党委的反革命修正主义分子一口拒绝了我的要求，却要我去搞软绵绵的阴沉沉的音乐。
    在无产阶级文化大革命节节胜利的大好形势下，去年四月，我们终于听到了江青同志早在一九六四年作出的钢琴要为革命现代京剧伴唱的指示。这样重要的指示，竟被一小撮反革命修正主义分子封锁了整整两年半之久。江青同志的指示给我们指明了前进的方向，给了我们巨大的精神力量。我们决心根据江青同志的指示，在钢琴为革命现代京剧伴唱方面闯出一条路子来。
    去年五月，为了迎接我们伟大领袖毛主席的光辉著作《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》发表二十五周年，我团组织了一个毛泽东思想宣传队上街去演出，第一次把钢琴搬上了街头。在宽广雄伟的天安门广场，我和乐团另一位同志合作，为工农兵表演了《沙家浜》中沙奶奶《斥敌》一段，我们的初步尝试受到了热烈的欢迎。广大工农兵群众兴奋地说：“钢琴是我们劳动人民创造的，应该为工农兵服务。钢琴过去弹的东西我们听不懂，今天弹革命现代京戏，钢琴就解放出来了。”一位老工人激动地说：“我从十一岁就开始做工，过去听不懂钢琴，今天钢琴演奏革命现代京戏我能听懂了，这是毛主席他老人家的英明伟大，我要千遍万遍高呼：毛主席万岁！万万岁！”广大工农兵群众对我们这个初步的尝试充分肯定，给了我们极大的鼓舞和鞭策。更使我们明确了，只有遵循毛主席“洋为中用、推陈出新”的教导，按照江青同志提出的为革命现代京剧伴唱的指示，走京剧革命的道路，才是正确的方向。
    但是，革命的道路是曲折的。那些反革命修正主义文艺黑线的代表人物，反动的学术“权威”，并不甘心于自己的失败。他们又装出一副极“左”的面孔，煽阴风点鬼火，到处散布谬论，胡说什么“钢琴有罪，人更有罪”，声称要“砸烂钢琴”。大刮“怀疑一切，否定一切”的阴风，妄图把水搅浑，动摇我们革命的决心。但是，有战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，有敬爱的江青同志给我们撑腰，我们天不怕，地不怕，革命的决心是下定了，阶级敌人的一切打击、破坏都是枉然。在中国京剧团革命同志的热情帮助和大力支持下，从去年五月份开始，我们就认真学习研究《红灯记》的唱段和伴奏。李玉和、李铁梅和李奶奶无比高大的英雄形象激励着我们，我们更有了用钢琴来表现他们、歌颂他们的迫切要求。经过几个月的艰苦奋战，我和刘长瑜同志合作搞出了几段《红灯记》中铁梅的钢琴伴唱，于去年国庆节与首都观众见面了。并且制成录音，向江青同志汇报。去年十一月二十日，江青同志在百忙中听了钢琴伴唱《红灯记》的录音，并作了极其重要的批示。江青同志指出：这是一个良好的开端，并具体指示我们继续搞出李玉和、李铁梅和李奶奶的主要唱段，为钢琴伴唱革命现代京剧走出一条路子来。江青同志以满腔的无产阶级革命热情对钢琴伴唱《红灯记》这个革命的新生事物给予充分的肯定，使我们感到浑身是劲，决心在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争中，紧跟江青同志顽强地战斗下去。我们响应伟大领袖毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，一边参加运动，一边加紧学习革命现代京剧，加紧创作，经过几个月的不断实践，于今年五月份写完了李玉和、李铁梅的全部重要唱段，与钱浩梁、刘长瑜同志合作，制成录音，再次向江青同志汇报。“七·一”前夕，敬爱的江青同志和中央文革的其他首长，亲自接见了我和钱浩梁、刘长瑜等同志，对钢琴伴唱《红灯记》给予高度评价。这是无产阶级司令部对我们革命文艺工作者的最大鼓舞，最大鞭策。
    回顾这几年来的战斗历程，钢琴伴唱《红灯记》的诞生和成长，一刻也离不开战无不胜的毛泽东思想，离不开毛主席的革命文艺路线，一刻也离不开江青同志的亲切关怀和谆谆教导。是敬爱的江青同志以她的勇敢捍卫毛主席革命文艺路线的无产阶级硬骨头精神，为我们树立了光辉的榜样，使我们敢于顶住逆流，奋勇前进。是敬爱的江青同志以她的谦虚、严谨的无产阶级革命品格为我们树立了光辉的榜样，使我们能够严肃对待艺术实践，在技术上精益求精。钢琴伴唱《红灯记》的诞生，只是钢琴革命万里长征的第一步，今后的工作还任重而道远，我们决心一辈子读毛主席的书，一辈子走革命的路，在阶级斗争的大风大浪中锻炼改造自己，以江青同志为光辉榜样，做一个永远忠于毛主席，永远忠于毛主席革命文艺路线的革命文艺战士，为发展无产阶级革命新文艺立新功。
