The military representatives participating in the Revolutionary Committee of Huizhou County, Guangdong Province, have brought the glorious traditions of the People's Liberation Army into the Revolutionary Committee. This has effectively promoted the thought revolutionization of the leadership cadre, leading to a new situation of unity between the military and the people, between the military and the government, and between the cadres and the masses. Various works are now vibrant and full of life.

Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, July 28: The military representatives participating in the Revolutionary Committee of Huizhou County, Guangdong Province, have brought the People's Liberation Army's tradition of holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, upholding the Four Firsts, and promoting the Three-Eight Style into the newly established Revolutionary Committee. They have helped the revolutionary leading cadres and revolutionary mass representatives in the committee to further achieve thought revolutionization. This has strengthened the unity between the military and the people, between the military and the government, and between the cadres and the masses, reinforced the dictatorship of the proletariat, and ensured that the newly established Revolutionary Committee continues to consolidate and develop amidst the storms of class struggle.

Since its establishment in January this year, the Revolutionary Committee of Huizhou County has, in its work, held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, emphasized proletarian politics, and achieved considerable success, winning the support of the masses. However, in the initial period, some revolutionary leading cadres were not bold enough in their work, fearing to repeat past mistakes. Some revolutionary mass representatives participating in the three-in-one combination were not good at exercising proletarian party spirit in their governance. The military representatives seized upon these active thoughts, following Chairman Mao's instruction that "a change in world outlook is a fundamental change," and together with everyone, studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions and the "Three Old Articles," carried out self-criticism and criticism of revisionism. This helped the revolutionary leading cadres and revolutionary mass organization representatives participating in the three-in-one combination to elevate their proletarian feelings for the great leader Chairman Mao to a new height. Through study, the revolutionary leading cadres deeply realized that the fundamental issue of whether or not to make mistakes lies in whether or not to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and emphasize proletarian politics. If proletarian politics are not emphasized and the root of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought is not grasped, it will deviate from Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and lead to mistakes. Thus, the revolutionary leading cadres enhanced their awareness of emphasizing proletarian politics and their sense of proletarian political responsibility, bravely shouldering the burden of leading the revolution and production. The revolutionary mass representatives also overcame bourgeois factionalism and made significant progress in thought revolutionization. The committee's internal unity was strengthened, and the Three-Eight Style was greatly promoted.

In the early days of the committee's establishment, due to the heavy workload, some revolutionary leading cadres were busy with administrative tasks and paid insufficient attention to class struggle. The military representatives, following Chairman Mao's instruction to "never forget class struggle," helped the committee members correctly handle the relationship between politics and administration, between revolution and production. They made everyone realize that whether or not to grasp class struggle is not a matter of work methods but a fundamental issue of whether or not to follow the path of emphasizing proletarian politics. At the initiative of the military representatives, the county Revolutionary Committee held an expanded meeting, organizing everyone to repeatedly study Chairman Mao's and Vice Chairman Lin's discussions on emphasizing proletarian politics. They reviewed the lessons of the old county committee and county people's committee, which did not emphasize proletarian politics, and discussed the benefits of emphasizing proletarian politics and the drawbacks of not doing so. This made everyone deeply realize that if they were to follow the revisionist path of prioritizing administration, the newly established Revolutionary Committee would not be able to consolidate and develop. Work, in all its aspects, should prioritize studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, vigorously grasping class struggle, deeply carrying out revolutionary criticism, and launching a fierce attack on the class enemy, placing it at the forefront of all work. With heightened awareness, the leading members of the Revolutionary Committee consciously went to the grassroots level, organizing the broad revolutionary masses to study and apply Mao Zedong Thought, deeply carry out revolutionary criticism, and actively attack the class enemy.

As class struggle deepened across the county, the revolutionary and production situation became excellent. In this favorable situation, some leading members of the Revolutionary Committee showed signs of arrogance and complacency, failing to continuously and seriously study the new situation and characteristics of class struggle. This affected the in-depth development of the struggle against the enemy. In response to this situation, with the help of the military representatives, the county Revolutionary Committee promptly held an expanded meeting. They repeatedly organized everyone to study Chairman Mao's latest instruction that "whether to protect or suppress the broad masses of the people is the fundamental difference between the Communist Party and the Kuomintang, between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, and between the dictatorship of the proletariat and the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie." They also guided everyone to review the situation and characteristics of class struggle in Huizhou County since liberation. Through study, everyone realized that only by mobilizing the masses and firmly striking down a handful of class enemies could the interests of the broad revolutionary masses be fundamentally protected, and the newly established Revolutionary Committee be consolidated and developed. Based on this heightened awareness, the military representatives took the lead in going to the front lines, to the units where class struggle was most complex, to establish work points. They mobilized the masses, vigorously grasped class struggle, and combined revolutionary criticism with the struggle against the enemy. This effectively struck down the class enemy and developed the favorable situation.

To promptly summarize the advanced experience of the work points, the military representatives of the Revolutionary Committee of Huizhou County spent most of their time establishing work points in grassroots units, using the experience of the points to guide the work of the surface. This thoroughly changed the bureaucratic style of the old organs, which were detached from the masses. Military representative Huang Zhengwu, for example, spent more than two-thirds of his time in grassroots work points, guiding the surface work effectively. In their work, the military representatives also seriously implemented the mass line work method, closely connecting with the masses. This played a good role in promoting the revolutionary leading cadres and revolutionary mass representatives in the committee to further implement the mass line.

The military representatives participating in the Revolutionary Committee of Huizhou County not only worked hard to help the revolutionary leading cadres and revolutionary mass representatives in the committee achieve thought revolutionization but also paid great attention to their own thought revolutionization. They often used individual heart-to-heart talks and regular democratic life meetings to carry out criticism and self-criticism, listening to the opinions of the revolutionary leading cadres and revolutionary mass representatives, and placing themselves under the supervision of the masses. As a result, the three forces in the committee were united, and a situation of unity between the military and the people, between the military and the government, and between the cadres and the masses emerged. Various works in the county were vibrant and full of life. The chairman of the county Revolutionary Committee, the former first secretary of the county committee, deeply felt that the military representatives were good at emphasizing proletarian politics, had good mass work style, and worked decisively. Over the past half year, he had learned a lot from the military representatives.

    在革委会中坚持四个第一大兴三八作风
    广东惠阳县革委会的军队代表，把解放军的光荣传统带进革委会，有力地促进了领导班子思想革命化，全县出现了军民团结、军政团结和干群团结的新局面，各项工作生气勃勃
    新华社广州二十八日电　参加广东省惠阳县革命委员会的军队代表，把人民解放军高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚持四个第一，大兴三八作风的光荣传统，带进新生的革命委员会，帮助革委会中的革命领导干部和革命群众代表，进一步实现思想革命化，加强了军民团结、军政团结和干群团结，强化了无产阶级专政，使新生的革命委员会在阶级斗争的大风大浪中，不断巩固和发展。
    惠阳县革委会今年一月成立后，参加革委会的革命领导干部和革命群众代表，在工作中高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，突出无产阶级政治，取得了不少成绩，受到了群众的拥护。但是，在开始一段时间，有些革命领导干部工作不够大胆，怕重犯过去的一些错误；参加三结合的部分革命群众代表，不能很好用无产阶级党性掌权。军队代表紧紧抓住这些活思想，遵照毛主席“世界观的转变是一个根本的转变”的教导，和大家一起学习毛主席的最新指示和“老三篇”，开展斗私批修，使参加三结合的革命领导干部和革命群众组织的代表把对伟大领袖毛主席的无产阶级感情提到新的高度。革命领导干部通过学习深刻地认识到，犯不犯错误最根本的问题，在于是不是高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，是不是突出无产阶级政治。如果不突出无产阶级政治，不抓活学活用毛泽东思想这个根本，就会背离毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，就要犯错误。这样，革命领导干部代表增强了突出无产阶级政治的自觉性，增强了无产阶级的政治责任感，勇敢地挑起了领导革命和生产的重担。革命群众代表也克服了资产阶级派性，在思想革命化方面有很大进步。革委会内部增强了团结，三八作风有很大发扬。
    革委会成立初期，由于工作多任务重，有些革命领导干部只忙于抓业务，对抓阶级斗争重视不够。军队代表遵照毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的教导，帮助革委会成员正确处理政治与业务、革命与生产的关系，使大家认识到，抓不抓阶级斗争，这不是一般的工作方法问题，而是走不走突出无产阶级政治道路的根本立场问题。在军队代表的倡议下，县革委会召开了扩大会议，组织大家反复学习毛主席和林副主席关于突出无产阶级政治的论述，总结旧县委、县人委多年来不突出无产阶级政治的教训，大谈突出无产阶级政治的甜头，大摆不突出无产阶级政治的苦头，使大家深刻地认识到，如果走向业务第一的修正主义道路，新生的革委会就不能巩固和发展；工作千条万条，活学活用毛泽东思想是第一条，应当自觉地把活学活用毛泽东思想，狠抓阶级斗争，深入开展革命大批判，向阶级敌人发起猛烈的进攻，放在一切工作的首位。认识提高了，革委会的领导成员都自觉地深入基层，组织广大革命群众活学活用毛泽东思想，深入开展革命大批判，主动地向阶级敌人进攻。
    随着阶级斗争的不断深入，全县的革命、生产形势一片大好。在这大好形势下，有些革委会的领导成员流露了一种骄傲自满情绪，没有做到不断认真研究阶级斗争的新形势，新特点，结果影响了对敌斗争的深入发展。针对这种情况，在军队代表的帮助下，县革委会又及时召开扩大会议，反复组织大家学习毛主席“对广大人民群众是保护还是镇压，是共产党同国民党的根本区别，是无产阶级同资产阶级的根本区别，是无产阶级专政同资产阶级专政的根本区别”的最新指示，并引导大家回顾解放以来惠阳县阶级斗争的情况和特点。大家通过学习认识到，只有放手发动群众，稳、准、狠地打击一小撮阶级敌人，才能从根本上保护广大革命群众的利益，巩固和发展新生的革命委员会。在提高认识的基础上，军队代表又带头深入第一线，到阶级斗争最复杂的单位去蹲点，放手发动群众，狠抓阶级斗争，把革命大批判和开展对敌斗争结合起来，有效地打击了阶级敌人，发展了大好形势。
    为了及时总结点上的先进经验，惠阳县革委会的军队代表，绝大部分时间都分别在基层单位蹲点，以点上的经验来指导面上的工作，彻底改变了旧机关脱离群众的官僚主义作风。军队代表黄正吾除了开会以外，平时三分之二以上的时间都在基层蹲点，以点指导面，有效地促进了面上工作的开展。军队代表在工作中还认真贯彻群众路线的工作方法，密切联系群众，对促进革委会中的革命领导干部和革命群众代表进一步贯彻群众路线，起了很好的推动作用。
    参加惠阳县革委会的军队代表，不仅努力帮助革委会中的革命领导干部和革命群众代表促进思想革命化，同时非常重视自身的思想革命化。他们经常通过个别谈心和定期召开民主生活会等方式，开展批评和自我批评，听取革命领导干部和革命群众代表的意见，把自己置于群众的监督之下。他们这样做的结果，革委会内三股力量拧在一起，出现了军民团结、军政团结和干群团结的局面，全县各项工作生气勃勃。县革委会主任、原县委第一书记深有感受地说：军队代表突出无产阶级政治好，联系群众作风好，工作雷厉风行，半年多来，自己向军队代表学到了许多东西。
