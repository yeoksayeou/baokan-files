The red flag rolls up the serfs' spears. The Chinese peasants, who have suffered deeply, under the leadership of the great leader Chairman Mao, have taken up arms to overthrow the three great mountains that have been weighing on them. The revolutionary modern ballet "The White-Haired Girl" enthusiastically sings the praises of the peasant armed revolution led by the Communist Party. This is a great revolution in ballet from politics to art, a great victory for Chairman Mao's revolutionary literary and artistic line, and a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought.

The ballet "The White-Haired Girl" was established as a brilliant model in the fierce struggle between the two classes and the two lines. Its creation and performance have been conducted under the care and guidance of the proletarian headquarters, especially Comrade Jiang Qing. As soon as the creation began, the troupe promptly conveyed an important directive from the proletarian headquarters: the ballet "The White-Haired Girl" must write the biography of the poor and lower-middle peasants, emphasize class struggle, emphasize armed revolution, and not overly depict the love relationship between Yang Zhi Xing and Xier. This pointed out the correct direction for the creation of the ballet "The White-Haired Girl."

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Political power grows out of the barrel of a gun." Literature and art must reflect the struggle for liberation of the working people, and must describe the armed revolution under the leadership of the Party. "Without armed struggle, there is no position for the proletariat, no position for the people, no position for the Communist Party, and no victory for the revolution."

The revolutionary ballet "The White-Haired Girl" prominently presents the great truth of "political power grows out of the barrel of a gun." After Xier was taken away, Wang Dasheng, under the guidance of the underground party member Uncle Zhao, abandoned the idea of fighting the enemy alone and joined the Eighth Route Army with a few young peasants from Yanggezhuang, taking up arms to make a revolution. The revolutionary people, with the gun, have everything. The ballet "The White-Haired Girl" especially added a scene where the Eighth Route Army liberated Yanggezhuang, and Wang Dasheng and the Eighth Route Army small detachment stayed to mobilize the masses, carry out work, and establish a revolutionary government. This scene prominently shows the great role of the people's army and the invincible power of military-civilian unity. With the people's army, with the unity between the military and the civilians as firm as a rock, and with the revolutionary government, the traitor and tyrant Huang Shiren was overthrown, and the people of Yanggezhuang were thoroughly liberated. However, the revolution is not yet complete, and the fruits of victory must be defended through struggle. The proletariat "can only liberate itself by liberating all humanity." In the finale of the revolutionary ballet "The White-Haired Girl," it thoroughly broke the trap set by a handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists to have Dasheng lay down his arms and enjoy the "rural happiness," but instead let Xier wear a red headscarf and join the revolutionary ranks with some of the villagers of Yanggezhuang, marching with the troops to continue the struggle for the liberation of all China and all humanity.

A handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists fiercely opposed the revolutionary ballet "The White-Haired Girl" expressing the theme that the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants want revolution, want to resist, and follow the Party to take up arms to make a revolution. They attempted to distort a life-and-death class struggle into a family story of joy and sorrow. They made a big deal out of the love relationship between Xier and Dasheng, and even when Dasheng returned to Yanggezhuang, they advocated that, like the prince in "Swan Lake" searching for the white swan among four little swans, Dasheng should search for Xier among a group of girls dancing the "red date dance." The revolutionary literary and artistic warriors armed with Mao Zedong Thought resolutely smashed the evil plot of a handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists to sabotage the revolutionary ballet "The White-Haired Girl." With strong proletarian feelings, they created the brilliant image of revolutionary peasants represented by Dasheng, making the revolutionary ballet "The White-Haired Girl" a surging and high-spirited song of resistance and struggle.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Without the poor peasants, there is no revolution. If you deny them, you deny the revolution. If you strike them, you strike the revolution." How to portray the heroic image of the poor and lower-middle peasants on stage is another focal point of the two-line struggle in the creation of the ballet "The White-Haired Girl."

The counter-revolutionary revisionists like Zhou Yang wanted to portray the protagonist Xier as a figure who was humiliated and harmed, full of grievances and tears but without resistance, and even harbored illusions about the landlord who trampled on her. This is a great insult to the poor peasants and a blatant advocacy of class conciliation and class surrenderism! Revolutionary literary and artistic workers thoroughly criticized the counter-revolutionary fallacies of Zhou Yang and his ilk, emphasizing Xier's daring to resist and fight, and vividly portraying her process of ideological development and growth. There is not a trace of the slave mentality of seeking to survive in her, but rather a spirit of daring to struggle and daring to rebel. When she rushed out of the Huang family's door and sang passionately, "I will not die! I will live! I will take revenge!" we believe that Xier's class hatred will erupt into a revolutionary blazing fire, burning down the Huang family's den and the entire old society. The counter-revolutionary revisionist Lin Mo Han, however, hated it to the core, saying, "Xier is too advanced, not in line with historical reality." Zhou Yang, Lin Mo Han, and their ilk are themselves the garbage of history and do not understand what historical reality is, nor can they understand the revolutionary spirit of the poor peasants.

Dasheng is the heroic image of armed peasants, a key figure in embodying the theme. The counter-revolutionary revisionists opposed portraying Dasheng mobilizing the masses under the Party's leadership, consolidating victory, and defending victory; they maliciously emphasized the love story between Dasheng and Xier, forcing the rotten idea of "love above all" into it. They wanted Dasheng to be single-mindedly searching for Xier, living their "happy life." In the creation of the ballet "The White-Haired Girl," revolutionary literary and artistic warriors engaged in a head-on struggle with them. Through Dasheng's revolutionary path, reflecting the revolutionary struggle of Chinese peasants under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party to seize political power by armed means, Dasheng's heroic character was further highlighted, and the theme was elevated.

There was also a fierce struggle between the two lines on how to portray the image of the old poor peasant Yang Bailao. Zhou Yang and his ilk claimed that Yang Bailao was a figure who could endure hardship and hunger and could only die drinking brine. Revolutionary literary and artistic workers armed with Mao Zedong Thought, with a class analysis perspective, emphasized the spirit of resistance of the old poor peasant Yang Bailao, letting him fiercely raise his hoe and strike at Huang Shiren... This hoe thoroughly smashed the sinister intentions of the counter-revolutionary revisionists to defame the poor peasants, raising the ideological realm of the characters to a new height, vividly embodying the brilliant idea that "the Chinese people cannot endure the rule of dark forces, and they always use revolutionary means to achieve the overthrow and transformation of such rule."

Through the creation of these three brilliant images, the revolutionary ballet "The White-Haired Girl" successfully wrote the biography of the poor and lower-middle peasants. It deeply portrays the great truth that "the poor peasants are the most extensive force of the Chinese revolution, the natural and most reliable allies of the proletariat, and the main force of the Chinese revolutionary ranks." No matter how the counter-revolutionary revisionists sabotage and disrupt, the result can only be in vain. The red sun illuminates the ballet stage, and the truth embodied by the revolutionary ballet "The White-Haired Girl" will forever shine brilliantly, forever inspiring us to march forward to victory!

    红旗卷起农奴戟
    ——赞革命现代芭蕾舞剧《白毛女》
    宛效东
    “红旗卷起农奴戟”。深受苦难的中国农民，在伟大领袖毛主席的领导下，拿起枪杆子，推翻了压在自己身上的三座大山。革命现代芭蕾舞剧《白毛女》，热情讴歌了共产党领导下的农民武装革命。这是芭蕾舞从政治到艺术的一次大革命，是毛主席革命文艺路线的伟大胜利，是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。
    芭蕾舞剧《白毛女》是在两个阶级、两条路线的激烈斗争中树立起来的光辉样板。它的创作和演出，自始至终是在无产阶级司令部，特别是在江青同志的关怀和指导下进行的。创作刚着手进行，剧团及时传达了来自无产阶级司令部的重要指示：芭蕾舞剧《白毛女》一定要为贫下中农立传，要突出阶级斗争，突出武装革命，不要过多地表现大春和喜儿的爱情关系。这就给芭蕾舞剧《白毛女》的创作指出了正确的方向。
    毛主席教导我们：“枪杆子里面出政权”。文艺要反映劳动人民的解放斗争，就必须描写在党领导下的武装革命。“离开了武装斗争，就没有无产阶级的地位，就没有人民的地位，就没有共产党的地位，就没有革命的胜利。”
    革命芭蕾舞剧《白毛女》，突出地表现了“枪杆子里面出政权”的伟大真理。当喜儿被抢走以后，王大春在地下党员赵大叔的指引下，抛弃了个人同敌人拚命的念头，和杨各庄的几位青年农民一起，参加了八路军，拿起枪来闹革命。革命的人民，有了枪杆子便有了一切。芭蕾舞剧《白毛女》特别增加了八路军解放杨各庄，王大春和八路军小分队留下来发动群众，开展工作，建立革命政权的一场戏。这场戏，突出了人民军队的伟大作用，表现了军民团结的无比威力。有了人民的军队，有了军民之间坚如磐石的团结，有了革命政权，才打倒了汉奸恶霸黄世仁，杨各庄的人民才得到彻底的解放。但是，革命并不是到此已经完成，胜利的果实必须用战斗来保卫。无产阶级“只有解放全人类才能最后解放无产阶级自己”。革命芭蕾舞剧《白毛女》在尾声里，彻底打破了一小撮反革命修正主义分子设置的要大春解甲归田，坐享“农家乐”的黑圈套，而是让喜儿戴上红头巾，和杨各庄的一些乡亲们一起加入了革命队伍，随着部队踏上征途，为解放全中国、解放全人类而继续战斗了。
    一小撮反革命修正主义分子，竭力反对革命芭蕾舞剧《白毛女》表现广大贫下中农要革命、要反抗，跟着党拿起枪来闹革命的主题，妄图把一场你死我活的阶级斗争篡改为悲欢离合的家庭故事。他们在喜儿和大春的爱情关系上大做文章，甚至在大春打回杨各庄时，他们主张象《天鹅湖》中的王子在四个小天鹅中寻找白天鹅一样，让大春在一群跳“红枣舞”的姑娘中去寻找喜儿。用毛泽东思想武装起来的革命文艺战士，坚决粉碎了一小撮反革命修正主义分子破坏革命芭蕾舞剧《白毛女》的罪恶阴谋。他们怀着强烈的无产阶级感情，塑造了以大春为代表的革命农民的光辉形象，使革命芭蕾舞剧《白毛女》成为激越高亢的反抗和斗争的战歌。
    毛主席教导我们：“没有贫农，便没有革命。若否认他们，便是否认革命。若打击他们，便是打击革命。”在舞台上如何塑造贫下中农的英雄形象，这是芭蕾舞剧《白毛女》创作过程中两条路线斗争的又一焦点。
  反革命修正主义分子周扬之流要把舞剧的主人公喜儿，写成是被侮辱被损害、有怨有泪而没有反抗的人物，甚至对蹂躏她的地主还抱有幻想。这是对贫农的极大污辱，这是明目张胆地宣扬阶级调和论和阶级投降主义！革命文艺工作者彻底批判了周扬之流污蔑贫下中农的反革命谬论，在舞剧中突出了喜儿敢于反抗、敢于斗争的大无畏精神，生动地表现了她的思想发展和成长的过程。在她身上，没有一丝一毫苟且偷生的奴隶气，而是充满着敢于斗争，敢于造反的革命精神。当她冲出黄家门，激昂高歌“我不死！我要活！我要报仇！”时，我们相信喜儿的阶级仇恨，必将爆发出革命的熊熊烈火，烧毁黄家魔窟，烧毁整个旧社会。对于喜儿形象的成功的再创造，反革命修正主义分子林默涵却恨得要命，他恶狠狠地说：“喜儿太先进了，不符合历史真实。”周扬、林默涵之流，本身就是历史的垃圾，根本不懂得什么是历史真实，根本不能理解贫农的革命精神。
    大春，是武装了的农民的英雄形象，是体现主题的一个关键人物。反革命修正主义分子反对表现大春在党的领导下发动群众，巩固胜利，保卫胜利的情节；别有用心地强调大春和喜儿的爱情线索，把“爱情至上”的一套破烂货硬塞进来。让大春一心找寻喜儿，过他们的“幸福生活”。芭蕾舞剧《白毛女》在创作过程中，革命文艺战士同他们进行了针锋相对的斗争。通过大春的革命道路，反映中国农民在毛主席、共产党领导下武装夺取政权的革命斗争，从而突出了大春的英雄性格，更加提高了主题。
    在怎样塑造老贫农杨白劳的形象的问题上，也存在两条路线的激烈斗争。周扬之流声称杨白劳是个“劳碌饥寒能忍耐”的没有反抗性的人物，只能喝盐卤而死。用毛泽东思想武装起来的革命文艺工作者，以阶级分析的观点，突出了老贫农杨白劳的反抗精神，让他狠狠地举起扁担，向黄世仁劈去……。这一扁担彻底粉碎了反革命修正主义分子丑化贫农的险恶用心，把人物的思想境界提到了一个新的高度，生动地体现了“中国人民是不能忍受黑暗势力的统治的，他们每次都用革命的手段达到推翻和改造这种统治的目的”的光辉思想。
    革命芭蕾舞剧《白毛女》，通过这三个光辉形象的塑造，成功地为贫下中农立了传。它深刻地表现了贫农“是中国革命的最广大的动力，是无产阶级的天然的和最可靠的同盟者，是中国革命队伍的主力军”的伟大真理。不管反革命修正主义分子如何地破坏、捣乱，其结果只能是枉费心机。红太阳照亮了芭蕾舞台，革命芭蕾舞剧《白毛女》所体现的真理，永远放射着夺目的光彩，永远鼓舞着我们胜利前进！
