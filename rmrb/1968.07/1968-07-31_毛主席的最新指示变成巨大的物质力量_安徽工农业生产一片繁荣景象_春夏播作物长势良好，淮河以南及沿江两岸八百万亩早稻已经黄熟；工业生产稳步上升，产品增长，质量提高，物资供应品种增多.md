Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, the revolutionary and production situation in Anhui Province is getting better and better. The province's agricultural and industrial production lines are presenting a prosperous and thriving scene. The spring and summer crops are growing well. In the southern part of the Huai River and along the banks of the Yangtze River, eight million mu of early rice have already ripened. Industrial production is steadily increasing, with products growing in quantity, improving in quality, and the variety of supplied materials increasing.

Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production," since this year, revolutionary committees at all levels in the province have sent a large number of Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams to the forefront of agricultural production. They have propagated and implemented Chairman Mao's latest instructions. In the rural areas of the province, large-scale Mao Zedong Thought study classes have been held, revolutionary criticism has been carried out, and a wave of "learning from Dazhai in agriculture" has been launched. Therefore, agricultural production this year has been grasped early and tightly from the beginning. The spring and summer crops in the province have expanded compared to previous years, with the early rice area increasing by 10% compared to last year. Now, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in the rural areas of the province are, after securing a bumper summer harvest, pressing forward to reap the early rice. The sorghum and corn in the Huaibei Plain are nearing maturity, presenting a scene of abundant production.

On the industrial front, as the revolutionary criticism deepens, revolutionary unity and the revolutionary three-in-one combination are being continuously consolidated and developed, and production is rising steadily. This year, the province's industrial production has been better each month, better each quarter, and better in the first half of the year compared to the same period last year. Coal, steel, transportation, and other sectors have seen even faster growth, all with significant increases compared to the same period last year.

Great leader Chairman Mao teaches: "Political work is the lifeline of all economic work." Revolutionary committees at all levels in the province resolutely implement Chairman Mao's great teachings, emphasizing proletarian politics, and using revolution to lead production. This year, revolutionary committees at all levels in the province have taken the establishment and improvement of Mao Zedong Thought study classes as a fundamental measure. They have held over 300,000 study classes of various types throughout the province. The broad masses of workers, poor and lower-middle peasants, Red Guards, revolutionary masses, and revolutionary cadres have taken "criticizing selfishness and criticizing revisionism" as the key, using Chairman Mao's latest instructions as weapons, thoroughly criticizing selfishness and establishing public spirit. This has greatly promoted the revolutionization of thought and powerfully pushed forward various tasks.

Revolutionary committees at all levels firmly remember Chairman Mao's great teaching: "Never forget class struggle." They lead the broad revolutionary masses of the province in launching unremitting and fierce attacks on class enemies. They combine the class struggle situation and tasks of their respective regions and units with various tasks, and carry out in-depth and sustained revolutionary criticism. The broad revolutionary masses have severely criticized the counter-revolutionary revisionist goods such as "three autonomies and one contract," "four freedoms," and "responsibility fields" promoted by China's Khrushchev and his agents in Anhui, Li Baohua and Huang Yan. They have exposed a handful of hidden class enemies, and the awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines has reached an unprecedented height, thus promoting the development of the revolution and production.

Now, the broad masses of soldiers and civilians in the province are further implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions, pressing forward to victory, and striving for greater victories in the revolution and production.

    新华社合肥二十九日电　在伟大领袖毛主席一系列最新指示指引下，安徽省革命和生产形势越来越好，工农业生产战线呈现一派繁荣兴旺景象。全省春夏播作物长势良好，淮河以南及沿江两岸八百万亩早稻已经黄熟；工业生产稳步上升，产品增长，质量提高；物资供应品种增多，市场繁荣。
    在毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针指引下，今年以来，全省各级革命委员会派出大批的毛泽东思想宣传队，深入农业生产第一线，宣传、落实毛主席一系列最新指示。全省农村中大办了毛泽东思想学习班，开展了革命大批判，掀起了“农业学大寨”的热潮。因此，今年农业生产一开始就抓得早、抓得紧。全省春夏播作物比往年扩大，早稻面积比去年扩大百分之十。现在，全省农村广大贫下中农在夺得夏粮丰收以后，乘胜前进，正在挥镰抢收早稻。淮北平原的高粱、玉米已接近成熟，呈现一派丰产景象。
    在工业战线上，随着革命大批判的深入开展，革命大联合和革命三结合得到不断巩固和发展，生产节节上升。今年上半年，全省工业生产一个月比一个月好，一个季度比一个季度好，上半年比去年同期好。煤炭、钢铁、交通运输等，上升得更快，都比去年同期有较大幅度增长。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导说：“政治工作是一切经济工作的生命线。”全省各级革委会坚决贯彻执行毛主席的伟大教导，突出无产阶级政治，以革命统帅生产。今年上半年，全省各级革委会都把大办、办好毛泽东思想学习班，作为狠抓根本的重大措施，在全省大办各种类型毛泽东思想学习班达三十多万期。广大工人、贫下中农、红卫兵小将、革命群众和革命干部，以“斗私，批修”为纲，以毛主席一系列最新指示为武器，大破私字，大立公字，大大促进了思想革命化，有力地推动了各项工作。
    各级革命委员会牢记毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的伟大教导，带领全省广大革命群众，向阶级敌人展开了不停顿的猛烈进攻。他们结合本地区、本单位阶级斗争的形势和任务，结合各项工作，深入持久地开展了革命大批判，广大革命群众狠批了中国赫鲁晓夫及其在安徽的代理人李葆华、黄岩之流所推行的“三自一包”、“四大自由”、“责任田”等反革命修正主义黑货，挖出了一小撮隐藏的阶级敌人，阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟空前提高，从而推动了革命和生产的向前发展。
    现在，全省广大军民正在进一步落实毛主席一系列最新指示，乘胜前进，夺取革命和生产的更大胜利。
