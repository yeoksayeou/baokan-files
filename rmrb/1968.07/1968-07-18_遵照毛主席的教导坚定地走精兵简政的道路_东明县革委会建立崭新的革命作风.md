The Dongming County Revolutionary Committee, in implementing streamlining and reducing bureaucracy, has established a new organizational structure. It continues to emphasize the struggle between the two lines, using Mao Zedong Thought to arm the minds of the committee members and staff, promoting the revolutionization of people's thinking, and fostering a new revolutionary style of closely linking with the masses.

Since the establishment of the Dongming County Revolutionary Committee, following Chairman Mao's great instruction to "implement unified leadership in the revolutionary committees, break down overlapping administrative structures, streamline and reduce bureaucracy, and organize a revolutionary leadership corps that is linked with the masses," the committee has mobilized the masses to criticize the counter-revolutionary revisionist line that China's Khrushchev promoted in the construction of political power. It has overcome the resistance of the old forces of the exploiting classes, broken out of the old organizational framework, and implemented streamlining and reducing bureaucracy. The county committee established one office, one political department, and one production command department, reducing the staff from the original 299 people of the former county committee and county people's committee to 34.

After implementing streamlining and reducing bureaucracy, the number of staff decreased, but the tasks of revolution and production were heavy. The county committee led all staff to further study and apply Chairman Mao's great instructions on the construction of revolutionary committees, combining them with various thoughts, and continuing to criticize China's Khrushchev's counter-revolutionary revisionist line in the construction of political power, eliminating its poisonous influence. Then, they established a new revolutionary style and work system according to Chairman Mao's instruction that "the reform of state organs, the most fundamental thing, is to link with the masses":

First, among the myriad tasks, focus on the fundamentals and vigorously promote the revolutionization of people's thinking. The fewer the people, the heavier the workload, the more we should place the study and application of Mao Zedong Thought in a position higher than everything, greater than everything, prior to everything, and more important than everything. The county committee took the establishment and operation of various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes as the fundamental task. In these classes, they emphasized the study and implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, the study and application of the "Old Three Articles," the elimination of selfishness and the establishment of public spirit, the transformation of worldviews, and invited old poor peasants to recall bitterness and sweetness, and to tell the history of revolutionary struggles. Through these activities, the class struggle and the struggle between the two lines awareness of the committee members and staff were further enhanced, greatly promoting the revolutionization of people's thinking. The leaders of the committee consciously went deep into the grassroots and among the masses, serving both as commanders and fighters. Many problems were solved at the grassroots level by relying on the masses. The staff remaining in the office also established the thought of wholeheartedly serving the people, with high work enthusiasm and revolutionary spirit, achieving the effect of one person doing the work of several. Because they focused on the fundamentals, all aspects of work in the county were promoted.

Second, grasp the main contradictions, focus on one central task in each period, and concentrate forces to win decisive battles. This spring, for a period, a small handful of class enemies spread the rightist reversal wind. The county committee immediately grasped this issue, leading various levels of revolutionary committees to hold various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes. They organized over a thousand people who studied in these classes into Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams, going deep among the masses, widely propagating Chairman Mao's latest instructions, fully mobilizing the masses, closely combining the revolutionary great criticism and the struggle against the enemy, smashing the rightist reversal wind, exposing a small handful of hidden class enemies, and achieving a major victory in the struggle against the enemy.

Third, implement the system of rotating duty by standing committee members. Of the 19 standing committee members of the county committee, only two were left in the office to handle daily work, while the rest went deep into the countryside. The county committee often focused on Dongfeng, Liu Xiaotai, and Li Zhuang, three relatively advanced brigades, as pilot points. Each task was carried out one step ahead in these pilot points, timely summarizing and promoting experiences, and guiding the overall work. While focusing on the pilot points, the county committee also emphasized that the main leaders of various levels of revolutionary committees should frequently go deep into the backward units to solve "old and difficult" problems. In a previous period, the two revolutionary mass organizations in Jiaoyuan Commune could not unite for a long time. The main leaders of the county committee went to this commune to help the two revolutionary mass organizations hold Mao Zedong Thought study classes, using Chairman Mao's latest instructions as a weapon, exposing the class enemies who incited the two factions to fight each other from behind, and quickly achieving revolutionary great unity.

Fourth, strengthen unified leadership, reduce meetings, further improve democratic centralism, and implement collective leadership and personal responsibility. Major issues must be discussed and decided by the committee collectively, and then implemented by different individuals. County-wide meetings were reduced as much as possible, and meeting times were shortened as much as possible. Meetings that the political department and the production command department must hold also required the approval of the revolutionary committee. They also implemented the "three unifications," which is the joint office of the office, political department, and production command department, unified telephone use, unified document issuance, and unified investigation and research, avoiding multiple leaderships. Many grassroots cadres reflected: After the county revolutionary committee established the new revolutionary style, we have more time to go deep into reality and link with the masses than before, and our work is more solid!

After the Dongming County Revolutionary Committee established the new revolutionary style, all tasks were completed well. The mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought was more widely and deeply carried out, the flames of the revolutionary great criticism burned more fiercely, production flourished, and everywhere was a lively revolutionary scene.

    遵照毛主席的教导坚定地走精兵简政的道路
    东明县革委会建立崭新的革命作风
    据新华社济南十七日电　山东省东明县革委会在实行精兵简政，建立起新的组织机构后，继续狠抓两条路线斗争的教育，用毛泽东思想武装革委会成员和工作人员的头脑，促进人的思想革命化，在革委会成员和工作人员中树立了崭新的密切联系群众的革命作风。
    东明县革命委员会成立以后，遵照毛主席“革命委员会要实行一元化的领导，打破重叠的行政机构，精兵简政，组织起一个革命化的联系群众的领导班子”的伟大教导，放手发动群众，批判中国赫鲁晓夫在政权建设方面推行的反革命修正主义路线；击破了剥削阶级旧势力的抵抗，跳出了旧机构的圈子，实行了精兵简政。县革委会成立了一个办公室，一个政治部和一个生产指挥部，工作人员由旧县委、县人委的实有编制二百九十九人，减少到三十四人。
    实行精兵简政以后，工作人员减少，革命和生产任务很重。县革委会便领导全体工作人员进一步活学活用毛主席关于革命委员会建设方面的伟大教导，结合各种活思想，继续狠批中国赫鲁晓夫在政权建设方面所推行的反革命修正主义路线，肃清其流毒。然后，他们根据毛主席“国家机关的改革，最根本的一条，就是联系群众”的教导，建立了一套新的革命作风和工作制度：
    第一，千头万绪抓根本，大力促进人的思想革命化。人员越少，工作任务越重，越是把活学活用毛泽东思想放在高于一切、大于一切、先于一切、重于一切的地位。县革委会把大办、办好各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，活学活用毛泽东思想，作为根本来抓。在这些学习班里，狠抓对毛主席最新指示的学习和落实，狠抓活学活用
  “老三篇”，破私立公，改造世界观，并请老贫农等忆苦思甜，讲革命斗争史。通过这些活动，进一步提高了革委会成员和工作人员的阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟，大大促进了人的思想革命化。革委会领导成员自觉地深入基层、深入群众，既当指挥员又当战斗员，许多问题都在基层依靠群众加以解决。留在机关的工作人员也树立了全心全意为人民服务的思想，工作热情很高，革命干劲很足，做到了一个人顶几个人用。由于狠抓根本，全县各方面的工作都带动起来了。
    第二，抓住主要矛盾，每个时期突出一个中心，集中力量打好歼灭战。今年春天，有一个时期，一小撮阶级敌人刮起了右倾翻案妖风。县革委会立即抓住这个问题，带领各级革委会，举办了各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，把在学习班学习的一千多人组成毛泽东思想宣传队，深入群众，广泛宣传毛主席的最新指示，充分发动群众，使革命的大批判和对敌斗争紧密结合起来，粉碎了右倾翻案妖风，把一小撮隐藏的阶级敌人挖了出来，取得了对敌斗争的重大胜利。
    第三，实行常委轮流值班制度。县革委会的十九名常委，只留二人在机关主持日常工作，其余的都分别深入农村。县革委会经常抓住东风、刘小台和李寨三个比较先进的大队作为基点，每项工作都在这些基点上先行一步，及时总结和推广经验，指导全面。在抓好基点的同时，县革委会还强调各级革委会主要负责人要经常深入到后进单位，解决“老大难”问题。前一时期，焦元公社两派革命群众组织长期联合不起来，县革委会主要负责人就到这个公社帮助两派革命群众组织举办毛泽东思想学习班，以毛主席的最新指示为武器，揪出了在背后挑动两派群众斗群众的阶级敌人，很快实现了革命大联合。
    第四，加强一元化领导，精减会议，进一步健全民主集中制，实行集体领导和个人负责相结合。凡是重大问题要经过委员会集体讨论通过，决定后分头去办。全县性的会议尽量减少，会议时间尽量缩短，政治部和生产指挥部必须召开的会议，也要经革委会批准。他们还实行了“三统一”，这就是办公室、政治部和生产指挥部联合办公，统一要电话，统一印发文件，统一深入调查研究，避免多头领导。许多基层干部反映：县革委会树立革命新作风后，咱们深入实际、联系群众的时间比过去多了，工作做得更踏实了！
    东明县革委会建立新的革命作风后，各项工作任务都完成得很好。全县活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动更加广泛深入地开展起来，革命大批判的烈火越烧越旺，生产蒸蒸日上，到处是一派生气勃勃的革命景象。
