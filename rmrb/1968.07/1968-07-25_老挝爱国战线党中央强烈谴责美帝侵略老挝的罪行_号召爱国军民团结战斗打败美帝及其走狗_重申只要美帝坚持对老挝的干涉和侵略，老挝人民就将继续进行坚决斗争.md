The Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front issued a statement on July 22, 1968, on the sixth anniversary of the 1962 Geneva Agreement on Laos, strongly condemning the crimes of American imperialist aggression against the Lao people. The statement calls on the Lao patriotic military and people to unite and fight to defeat the aggressive policies of American imperialism.

The statement says that in the six years since the 1962 Geneva Agreement on Laos was signed, American imperialism has continuously intensified its aggression against Laos. This is a continuation of its actions to sabotage the 1954 Geneva Agreement on Indochina.

The statement says that to achieve their plot of turning Laos into a new type of colony and military base, American imperialism and its lackeys, since 1962, have plotted a series of assassinations of patriotic figures and, on April 19, 1963, manipulated Kou Abhay to overthrow the government of national unity, thereby completely burying the tripartite agreements of Zurich and the Plain of Jars that led to the formation of this government. Subsequently, American imperialism set up a puppet government, installing Prince Souvanna Phouma as prime minister, and gave this government various disguises to deceive domestic and international opinion.

The statement says that the United States has also heavily supplied, trained, and armed puppet forces, and established a military invasion system including strategic roads, airports, military bases, and radar stations, intensifying the encroachment attacks on the liberated areas of Laos and the overall invasion of Laos.

The statement emphasizes that more seriously, at the "request" of Prince Souvanna Phouma, since April 1964, the U.S. Air Force has directly participated in the "special war" that the United States is waging in Laos, thus escalating the war to an unprecedented level of intensity. The vast majority of various types of modern U.S. aircraft, including B-52 bombers, taking off from bases in Thailand, have used weapons prohibited by international law, such as napalm, poison gas, and chemical agents, to increasingly barbarically attack villages and city centers in the liberated areas of Laos, even temples, hospitals, and schools have been attacked.

The statement says that the Lao people cherish peace and neutrality, but we want an independent and free peace and neutrality. Facing the brutal and barbaric American invasion war, the Lao people, to defend their lives and human rights, have risen up to bravely fight against the Americans and save the nation, and have already won great victories. In recent years, the Lao patriotic military and people have smashed the puppet army's and U.S. Air Force's various encroachment attacks and "pacification" operations, annihilated tens of thousands of enemy troops, seized or destroyed thousands of tons of military supplies, and shot down more than 800 U.S. military aircraft.

The statement says that American imperialism, unwilling to accept defeat, continues to use all means to persist in its aggressive policies and is even more frantically intensifying the war of aggression. The Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front once again reiterates that as long as American imperialism persists in its interference and aggression against Laos, the Lao people will continue to wage a resolute struggle. This is a sacred duty to defend the country and an inviolable right of self-defense for the Lao people.

The statement calls on all the people, cadres, and patriotic armed forces of Laos to unite as firmly as a rock, to fully display their unyielding national traditions, and to exert their utmost efforts to frustrate the aggressive policies of the United States and its lackeys.

The statement concludes by saying that the Lao people's just struggle against American aggression and for national salvation will have to overcome many difficulties and hardships, but the Lao people have many fundamental advantages. Therefore, the Lao people will definitely win, and the enemy is doomed to failure. A peaceful, independent, neutral, democratic, unified, and prosperous Laos will definitely be realized.

    老挝爱国战线党中央强烈谴责美帝侵略老挝的罪行
    号召爱国军民团结战斗打败美帝及其走狗
    重申只要美帝坚持对老挝的干涉和侵略，老挝人民就将继续进行坚决斗争
    新华社康开二十四日电　老挝爱国战线党中央委员会二十二日就一九六二年关于老挝问题的日内瓦协议签订六周年发表声明，强烈谴责美帝国主义对老挝人民犯下的侵略罪行，号召老挝爱国军民团结战斗，挫败美帝国主义的侵略政策。
    声明说，在一九六二年关于老挝问题的日内瓦协议签订后的六年内，美帝国主义一直不断地加强对老挝的侵略战争。这是它破坏一九五四年关于印度支那问题的日内瓦协议的行动的继续。
    声明说，美帝国主义及其走狗为了实现它们把老挝变为新型殖民地和军事基地的阴谋，从一九六二年起，策划了一系列暗杀爱国人士的事件，并于一九六三年四月十九日，操纵库·阿沛推翻了民族团结政府，从而彻底埋葬了产生这个政府的苏黎世和查尔平原的三方协议。接着，美帝国主义又拼凑起一个傀儡政权，把梭发那·富马亲王扶上首相位置，并给这一政权加上各种伪装，以欺骗国内外舆论。
    声明说，美国还大力供养、训练和武装傀儡军队，并建立了包括战略公路、机场、军事基地和雷达站等的军事侵略体系，加紧对老挝解放区发动蚕食进攻和对老挝进行全面侵略。
    声明着重指出，更为严重的是，根据富马亲王的“请求”，从一九六四年四月以来，美国空军直接参加了美国在老挝进行的“特种战争”，从而使这场战争达到空前激烈的程度。绝大多数是从泰国基地上起飞的各种类型的美国现代化飞机，其中包括B—52轰炸机在内，使用了为国际法所禁止的诸如凝固汽油弹、毒瓦斯和化学毒剂等武器，越来越野蛮地袭击老挝解放区的村庄和城市中心，甚至寺庙、医院和学校都遭到袭击。
    声明说，老挝人民珍视和平与中立，然而我们要的是独立与自由的和平与中立。面对残暴和野蛮的美国侵略战争，老挝人民为了保卫自己的生命和人权，奋起为抗美救国而英勇地进行斗争，并已赢得了伟大的胜利。近年来，老挝爱国军民粉碎了伪军和美国空军的各次蚕食进攻和“绥靖”行动，歼灭了数以万计的敌军，缴获或摧毁了数千吨军火弹药，击落了八百多架美国军用飞机。
    声明说，美帝国主义不甘心失败，仍在采用一切手段来继续推行其侵略政策，更加疯狂地加紧侵略战争。老挝爱国战线党中央委员会再次重申，只要美帝国主义坚持对老挝的干涉和侵略，老挝人民就将继续进行坚决的斗争。这是保卫国家的神圣义务，也是老挝人民不可侵犯的自卫权利。
    声明号召老挝全体人民、干部和爱国武装力量坚如磐石般地团结起来，最高度地发扬他们的不屈不挠的民族传统，全力以赴，挫败美国及其走狗的侵略政策。
    声明最后说，老挝人民抗美救国的正义斗争，还需要克服许多艰难困苦，然而老挝人民有许多根本的有利条件。因此，老挝人民一定会胜利，敌人注定要失败。一个和平、独立、中立、民主、统一和繁荣的老挝一定会实现。
