The great leader Chairman Mao recently pointed out: "Whether to protect or suppress the broad masses of the people is the fundamental difference between the Communist Party and the Kuomintang, the fundamental difference between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, and the fundamental difference between proletarian dictatorship and bourgeois dictatorship." The attitude towards the masses and mass movements is fundamentally different for different classes, different parties, and different countries. Protecting or suppressing the masses is the dividing line between revolution and counter-revolution.

The class position of the proletariat determines that it is the most revolutionary and progressive class in human history. The proletariat can only liberate itself by liberating all of humanity. The class interests of the proletariat represent the fundamental interests of the broad masses of the people. Protecting the masses and struggling for their fundamental interests is the starting point of the proletarian revolutionary faction.

The interests of the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes are fundamentally opposed to those of the broad masses of the people. Their interests are based on the exploitation and oppression of the people. China's Khrushchev is the biggest capitalist-roader within the party. His reactionary class interests determine his anti-party, anti-people, anti-socialist, and anti-Mao Zedong Thought nature. To realize his wolfish ambition of restoring capitalism, he has consistently advocated the reactionary theories of "tools," "spontaneity," and "control," frenziedly destroying and suppressing revolutionary mass movements, attempting to make China's history regress to the dark era of Kuomintang reactionary rule. We must raise high the banner of criticizing reactionary theories in the spirit of Mao Zedong Thought, thoroughly criticize China's Khrushchev's reactionary fallacies of destroying and suppressing revolutionary mass movements, and eliminate their poisonous influence.

The people, and only the people, are the creators of world history

The great teacher Chairman Mao teaches us: "History is created by the people," "The people, and only the people, are the creators of world history." This is Chairman Mao's most profound summary of historical materialism.

Vice Chairman Lin points out: "People's revolution under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought is the locomotive of history's progress." In the new era where Mao Zedong Thought is the great banner of the world, the great truths of Mao Zedong Thought powerfully promote the leaps and bounds development of human history. The great victory of the Chinese revolution is the victory of the revolutionary mass movement under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought. In the past, under Chairman Mao's wise leadership, the hundreds of millions of revolutionary people of our country fought bravely, overthrowing the three big mountains oppressing the Chinese people, achieving victory in the democratic revolution; then they carried out the three great transformations, achieving basic victory in the socialist revolution. Now, Chairman Mao, with the greatest spirit of a proletarian revolutionary leader, personally initiates and leads the hundreds of millions of proletarian revolutionaries and revolutionary masses of our country to continue the great political revolution of the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes under socialist conditions, achieving decisive victory. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao is an unprecedented, magnificent, and great mass movement in human history. Chairman Mao has developed the party's mass line and the Marxist-Leninist theory that the people create history to new heights.

The history of revolutionary movements led by the Communist Party of China has repeatedly proven that revolutionary mass movements are the movements of widely spreading and raising high Mao Zedong Thought, and the movements of deeply rooting Mao Zedong's revolutionary line in the hearts of the masses. Only by deeply and widely mobilizing the masses with Mao Zedong Thought, handing over the party's policies to the masses, and turning them into the masses' conscious actions, can the revolutionary mass movement be deeply and sustainably developed, and victory in the revolutionary struggle be achieved. When the masses grasp Mao Zedong Thought, this invincible spiritual weapon, they will become a powerful material force for transforming the world. The depth and breadth of the revolution depend on the depth and breadth of the mass movement, and the depth and breadth of the mass movement depend on the extent to which Mao Zedong Thought penetrates the masses. The more Mao Zedong Thought penetrates the masses, the more the mass movement develops, and the more the revolution develops, the faster history will advance by leaps and bounds.

In contrast to historical materialism, historical idealism, which represents the interests of the exploiting classes, has always denied the great role of the masses of the people and denied that the masses of the people are the masters of history. All idealists, standing on a reactionary class position and from a reactionary worldview, maliciously distort history, invert history, regard the people who create history as slaves and "tools" for their use, and regard themselves, this small clique of parasites, as the masters of history. They use these reactionary fallacies to deceive the people, fool the people, and maintain their reactionary rule.

China's Khrushchev is the biggest capitalist-roader within the party, an agent of the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes. Like his ancestors, he is a typical historical idealist. He has always advocated the extremely reactionary theory of "tools," maliciously slandering the masses of the people as "living tools." He said: "Cattle are living tools," "People are even more living tools." Look, how malicious this slander is! China's Khrushchev nakedly exposes his extremely hostile, counter-revolutionary nature towards the masses of the people.

Our great teacher Chairman Mao has given the highest evaluation of the historical role of the masses of the people: "The masses are the real heroes," "The creative power of the masses of the people is boundless." This is the attitude that all Marxists-Leninists should have towards the masses of the people.

All exploiting classes, without exception, regard the masses of the people as their tools. Slave owners regard slaves as "speaking tools," feudal landlords regard peasants as "cattle," capitalists regard workers as "machines" for creating profits. China's Khrushchev, standing on the reactionary position of slave owners, feudal lords, and capitalists, regards the masses of the people as "living tools." As early as the late 19th century, the German bourgeois idealist philosopher Nietzsche said: "Humanity is more of a means than an end," "Humanity is just material for experiments." China's Khrushchev's reactionary theory of "tools" is just a piece of junk picked up from reactionary bourgeois philosophers. He truly deserves to be the filial son and worthy grandson of the exploiting classes. He rants about how workers and peasants have "hooliganism," "conservatism," and "backwardness." He regards the masses as ignorant "mob" and dresses himself up as a "savior," repeating the shameless clichés of the exploiting classes for thousands of years.

China's Khrushchev is a great schemer and conspirator against the party and the people. His theory of "tools" is to create counter-revolutionary public opinion for his plot to usurp the party and the state. The so-called "theory of tools" is to train the spirit of slavery, implement a policy of fooling the people, stifle the revolutionary spirit of the masses of the people, and attempt to make the masses of the people into obedient slaves, into "tools" for his arbitrary manipulation. His black "self-cultivation" is to cultivate people into confused fools who do not want revolution and proletarian dictatorship, into "tame tools" for his restoration of capitalism. He frenziedly shouts: Only "tame tools" and "easy-to-control tools" are allowed, not "mischievous tools" and "hard-to-control tools," this is completely the tone of a slave owner. To overthrow proletarian dictatorship and restore capitalism in China, he even openly howls, "If a Khrushchev coup occurs within the Chinese party," people must obey. The plot is revealed, and China's Khrushchev exposes his ferocious counter-revolutionary face. Originally, his "living tools" and "tame tools" are all for his counter-revolutionary coup. If China's Khrushchev's plot succeeds, capitalism will be restored in China, humanity will experience a great regression in history, and millions of revolutionary people will lose their heads. What a dangerous scene this is!

Firmly rely on and closely unite with the masses of the people, strengthen proletarian dictatorship, and promote the progress of history

The fundamental issue of revolution is the issue of power. The struggle between the two lines ultimately comes down to seizing power and opposing the seizure of power, consolidating proletarian dictatorship and overthrowing proletarian dictatorship. Chairman Mao teaches us: Dictatorship is the dictatorship of the masses. Therefore, the attitude towards the masses is the attitude towards proletarian dictatorship. Protecting the masses is consolidating proletarian dictatorship; suppressing the masses is destroying and overthrowing proletarian dictatorship. To consolidate proletarian dictatorship, we must firmly carry out Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, believe in the masses, rely on the masses, mobilize the masses, firmly support and protect revolutionary mass movements, and protect the broad masses of the people. At the same time, we must firmly suppress the class enemies. Tolerance towards the enemy is cruelty towards the people. Only by implementing dictatorship over the small clique of unrepentant capitalist-roaders within the party and the remnants of traitors, spies, landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists of the Kuomintang reactionary clique can we consolidate the power of the proletariat and truly protect the masses of the people.

China's Khrushchev, standing on the position of the Kuomintang reactionaries, to overthrow proletarian dictatorship and restore capitalism, protects and shields the enemies of the people in every way, while frenziedly destroying and suppressing the broad masses of the people and revolutionary mass movements. In dealing with mass movements, he has always advocated and practiced the theories of "spontaneity" and "control," aiming to destroy and suppress revolutionary mass movements and implement bourgeois dictatorship over the masses of the people.

China's Khrushchev advocates what: We "must and mainly rely on the spontaneous movement of the masses.... We should not be afraid of such spontaneous movements; we need such spontaneous movements and should encourage and promote them," the masses "should do whatever they want to do." This "theory of spontaneity" is actually the opium of the bourgeoisie to drug revolutionary people and a means to destroy the revolutionary movements of the masses of the people.

Marxism-Leninism holds that revolutionary mass movements must have correct leadership in ideology, politics, and organization to achieve thorough victory. Chairman Mao teaches us: "In Marxism, theory is important, and its importance is fully expressed in Lenin's words: 'Without revolutionary theory, there can be no revolutionary movement.'" However, revolutionary theory is not spontaneously produced by the masses. "Spontaneous movements" can only produce syndicalist ideas, economicist, and reformist ideas, and cannot produce scientific socialist and communist ideas. Socialist and communist revolutionary theories are created by revolutionary leaders who represent the fundamental interests of the proletariat and the broad laboring masses, concentrating the finest thoughts of humanity, and summarizing revolutionary struggle experiences. The invincible Mao Zedong Thought is the highest level of Marxism-Leninism in contemporary times, the greatest revolutionary truth, and the finest thought representing the interests of the proletariat and laboring masses under new historical conditions. Only by infusing Mao Zedong Thought into the workers and peasants, raising the ideological awareness of the people, can the revolutionary mass movement become a conscious political struggle, seize power, establish proletarian dictatorship, and carry out the class struggle under proletarian dictatorship to the end, achieving thorough liberation. China's Khrushchev advocates the "theory of spontaneity," his malicious intention is to oppose arming the masses with the great Mao Zedong Thought, guiding the revolutionary mass movement, attempting to corrupt the masses with the decadent thoughts of the bourgeoisie, destroy the revolutionary mass movement, and lead the mass movement onto the path of his restoration of capitalism.

The reactionary nature of the "theory of spontaneity" also lies in its opposition to the party's leadership of the revolutionary mass movement in organization. The revolutionary mass movement of the proletariat, without the leadership of the Marxist-Leninist party, will definitely go astray and sabotage the revolutionary cause of the proletariat. China's Khrushchev advocates the "theory of spontaneity," advocating the anarchist fallacy of "the masses should do whatever they want to do," its essence is not to have leadership, not to have a government, but only to have the leadership of the Communist Party and the government of the proletariat, but to have the leadership of the Kuomintang and the government of the bourgeoisie. Advocating the "theory of spontaneity" is to destroy the revolutionary mass movement and to implement bourgeois dictatorship over the revolutionary mass movement.

China's Khrushchev, this great traitor, has always been the chief culprit in suppressing revolutionary mass movements. To suppress the masses and curb revolutionary mass movements, in addition to using the "theory of spontaneity," he also frequently uses the big stick of the "theory of control." He frenziedly shouts: "The mass movement must be controllable in leadership."

China's Khrushchev's "theory of control" is diametrically opposed to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line of "mobilizing the masses," handing over the party's line, policies, and guidelines to the masses, "letting the masses rise up in revolution, educate themselves, manage themselves, and liberate themselves." His reactionary "theory of control" is the "tutelage" of the Kuomintang reactionaries, aiming to control the revolutionary masses within the bourgeois track, control them within the framework of his counter-revolutionary revisionist line. "Control" is suppression. Not allowing a step beyond the framework of his reactionary bourgeois line, otherwise immediate suppression. "Controlling" the masses, "moving" the masses, these are China's Khrushchev's consistent tricks to suppress revolutionary mass movements.

The revolutionary mass movement of the proletariat must have the leadership of the Communist Party, but this revolutionary leadership is fundamentally different from China's Khrushchev's counter-revolutionary "control." Chairman Mao teaches us: "The problem of the relationship between the party and the masses should be: The party must, according to the situation, lead the masses to realize the correct opinions of the masses; while for the incorrect opinions that arise among the masses, the party must educate the masses to correct them," "We must be good at guiding the petty-bourgeois ideology within our ranks onto the track of proletarian revolution." Concentrating the correct opinions of the masses, leading the masses to realize them, educating the masses to recognize the fundamental interests of the proletariat and the broad laboring masses, handing over the party's guidelines and policies to the masses, fully believing in and relying on the masses, respecting the pioneering spirit of the masses, protecting the initiative of the masses, guiding the masses to educate themselves and liberate themselves, this is the party's leadership of the mass movement. While China's Khrushchev's "theory of control" is to bind the masses, suppress revolutionary mass movements, make the masses into slaves for his manipulation, and serve his attempt to restore capitalism.

The "theory of spontaneity" and the "theory of control" are the consistent methods used by all exploiting classes and old and new revisionists and opportunists to destroy and suppress revolutionary mass movements. At every major turning point in the Chinese revolution, China's Khrushchev has attempted to use the two counter-revolutionary hands of the "theory of spontaneity" and the "theory of control" to extinguish the blazing revolutionary mass movements and achieve his counter-revolutionary goals. He used the "theory of spontaneity" to incite the bourgeoisie to attack the proletariat and used the "theory of control" to suppress the proletariat's counterattack against the bourgeoisie. His entire history is a record of continuously using the two hands of the "theory of spontaneity" and the "theory of control" to destroy and suppress revolutionary mass movements. In 1927, he followed Chen Duxiu's capitulationist line, ordering the Wuhan workers' picket teams to hand over several thousand guns to the Kuomintang and disband the workers' picket teams, extinguishing the fiery mass movement. Subsequently, he vigorously advocated the "theory of spontaneity" in the workers' movement, opposing the workers' political struggle, attempting to lead the workers' movement onto the wrong path of economism. In 1947, he proposed a line of "the masses should do whatever they want to do," "overstepping the party branch, moving stones, kicking out village and district cadres," a pseudo-leftist and rightist reactionary line, opposing Chairman Mao's revolutionary line of "the work team or work group sent by the higher level to the countryside must first unite all the active and relatively good elements within the local party branch organization, jointly leading the local land reform work." In 1955, when the hundreds of millions of peasant masses of the country, under Chairman Mao's personal leadership, began to launch the high tide of agricultural cooperativization, China's Khrushchev and his accomplices, behind Chairman Mao's back, wielded the magic sword, ruthlessly slaughtering the great peasant revolutionary movement. In 1963, he again frenziedly destroyed the socialist education movement, sending his bourgeois wife Wang XX to the Taoyuan Brigade for so-called "squatting points," carrying out mysterious "rooting and linking," carrying out "washing hands and bathing," directing the spearhead at the broad poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres, striking a large number and protecting a few, and throwing out the "Taoyuan experience" to destroy the socialist education movement nationwide, deliberately and systematically implementing the restoration of capitalism.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution personally initiated and led by our supreme commander Chairman Mao is the greatest revolutionary mass movement. China's Khrushchev, sensing the end of his days, even more frenziedly waved the black flags of the "theory of control" and the "theory of spontaneity," attempting to strangle this unstoppable revolutionary mass movement. After the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution mass movement was launched with great momentum, China's Khrushchev vigorously promoted the "theory of control," sending a large number of work teams, drawing frameworks, setting tones, implementing bourgeois dictatorship over the revolutionary masses. He inverted right and wrong, confused black and white, "surrounded" the revolutionary faction, suppressed different opinions, implemented white terror, labeling a large number of revolutionary masses as "counter-revolutionaries" and "rightists," attempting to suppress the fiery Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution movement. When Chairman Mao led the hundreds of millions of revolutionary masses to expose and criticize China's Khrushchev's reactionary bourgeois line, he and his accomplices again raised the anarchist broken flag, proposing the counter-revolutionary slogan of "doubt everything, overthrow everything," stirring up the evil wind of economism. He once again attempted to use the pseudo-leftist and rightist "theory of spontaneity" to destroy the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. However, it is foolish to block a car with an arm, and it is difficult to shake a tree with an ant. The unprecedented revolutionary mass movement personally initiated and led by our great leader Chairman Mao has cleared the accounts of China's Khrushchev's reactionary bourgeois line and pronounced the political death sentence on China's Khrushchev.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The party organization should be composed of advanced elements of the proletariat and should be a vigorous vanguard organization that can lead the proletariat and revolutionary masses to fight against the class enemies." Chairman Mao's latest instruction profoundly points out the fundamental nature of the proletarian revolutionary party. According to Chairman Mao's teachings, our party, under new historical conditions, under the condition that the proletariat holds revolutionary power, must continue to maintain and carry forward the fine tradition of actively protecting the masses and closely uniting with the masses, leading the proletariat and the broad masses of the people to continuously, steadily, accurately, and fiercely strike a small clique of class enemies, to forever maintain the vigorous revolutionary youth and to carry the revolution through to the end.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution personally initiated and led by the great leader Chairman Mao has greatly carried forward the party's fine tradition of protecting the masses and closely uniting with the masses and the fine revolutionary tradition of the mass line. The hundreds of millions of proletarian revolutionaries and revolutionary masses of our country, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, have raised high the banner of "it is reasonable to rebel against reactionaries," carried forward the pioneering spirit of the revolution, thoroughly smashed the counter-revolutionary headquarters of the bourgeoisie hidden within our party, led by China's Khrushchev, criticized the counter-revolutionary revisionist line they promoted, established Mao Zedong Thought, and established new revolutionary power organs—the revolutionary committees. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has achieved great victories in politics, ideology, and organization.

China's Khrushchev, this ringleader of counter-revolutionary revisionism, has always stubbornly stood on the position of opposing the people, using the counter-revolutionary theories of "tools," "spontaneity," and "control," frenziedly destroying and ruthlessly suppressing revolutionary mass movements, carrying out the style of the Kuomintang, attempting to stop the wheels of history from rolling forward. However, under the brilliant illumination of Mao Zedong Thought, his tricks have met with a shameful failure.

The dialectics of history are like this: Whoever opposes the revolutionary mass movement, whoever opposes Mao Zedong Thought, whoever opposes Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, no matter how cunning they are, they will ultimately not escape the fate of destruction. China's Khrushchev, who has always frenziedly suppressed revolutionary mass movements and opposed Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, ultimately did not escape the punishment of history. This once-glorious "big figure" is just a historical clown worthy of ridicule!

Let us raise high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, carry forward the party's fine tradition of closely uniting with the masses, firmly stand with the broad revolutionary masses, thoroughly criticize China's Khrushchev's reactionary fallacies of destroying and suppressing revolutionary mass movements, and achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

    革命的群众运动是历史前进的火车头
    ——彻底批判中国赫鲁晓夫破坏和镇压革命群众运动的反动谬论
    中国人民解放军高等军事学院
    伟大领袖毛主席最近指出：“对广大人民群众是保护还是镇压，是共产党同国民党的根本区别，是无产阶级同资产阶级的根本区别，是无产阶级专政同资产阶级专政的根本区别。”对待人民群众，对待群众运动，不同的阶级、不同的党派、不同的国家，有根本不同的立场、观点和态度。保护还是镇压人民群众，是区分革命同反革命的分水岭。
    无产阶级的阶级地位决定了它是人类历史上最革命、最进步的阶级。无产阶级只有解放全人类，才能最后解放自己。无产阶级的阶级利益代表了广大人民群众的根本利益。保护群众，为群众的根本利益而奋斗，是无产阶级革命派的出发点。
    资产阶级和一切剥削阶级同广大人民群众的利益是根本对立的，他们的利益是建立在剥削人民、压迫人民的基础上的。中国赫鲁晓夫是党内最大的走资派，他的反动的阶级利益决定了他反党、反人民、反社会主义、反毛泽东思想的本质。为了实现他复辟资本主义的狼子野心，他一贯鼓吹反动的“工具”论、“自发”论、“控制”论，疯狂地破坏和镇压革命群众运动，妄图使中国的历史倒退到国民党反动统治的黑暗时代。我们必须高举毛泽东思想的革命批判大旗，彻底批判中国赫鲁晓夫破坏和镇压革命群众运动的反动谬论，肃清其流毒。
    人民，只有人民，才是创造世界历史的动力
    伟大导师毛主席教导我们：“历史是人民创造的”，“人民，只有人民，才是创造世界历史的动力。”这是毛主席对历史唯物主义最精辟的概括。
    林副主席指出：“毛泽东思想指引下的人民革命是历史前进的火车头。”在世界进入以毛泽东思想为伟大旗帜的新时代，毛泽东思想的伟大真理，强有力地推动着人类历史的飞跃发展。中国革命的伟大胜利，就是毛泽东思想指引下的革命群众运动的胜利。过去，在毛主席的英明领导下，我国亿万革命人民英勇奋战，推翻了压在中国人民头上的三座大山，取得了民主革命的胜利；紧接着又实现了社会主义三大改造，取得了社会主义革命的基本胜利。现在，毛主席以无产阶级革命导师最伟大的气魄亲自发动和领导着我国亿万无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众，继续进行在社会主义条件下无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命，已经取得了决定性的胜利。毛主席亲自发动和领导的这场无产阶级文化大革命，是人类历史上空前的波澜壮阔的伟大群众运动。毛主席把我们党的群众路线，把马克思列宁主义关于人民群众创造历史的理论发展到了新的高峰。
    中国共产党领导的历次革命运动一再证明，革命的群众运动就是毛泽东思想大普及大提高的运动，就是毛主席革命路线深入人心的群众运动。只有用毛泽东思想深入广泛地发动群众，把党的方针、政策交给群众，变成群众的自觉行动，才能使革命群众运动深入持久地发展下去，才能取得革命斗争的胜利。人民群众掌握了毛泽东思想这一战无不胜的精神武器，就会变成改造世界的强大的物质力量。革命的深度和广度取决于群众运动的深度和广度，而群众运动的深度和广度则取决于毛泽东思想深入群众的程度。毛泽东思想越深入群众，群众运动也就越深入发展，革命也就越深入发展，历史就会飞跃前进。
    同历史唯物主义相反，代表剥削阶级利益的历史唯心主义，一向否认人民群众的伟大作用，否认人民群众是创造历史的主人。一切唯心主义者站在反动的阶级立场上，从反动的世界观出发，肆意歪曲历史，颠倒历史，把创造历史的人民群众看作供他们驱使的奴隶和“工具”，而把他们自己这一小撮寄生虫，看作历史的主人。他们用这种反动谬论来愚弄人民，欺骗人民，以维护他们的反动统治。
    中国赫鲁晓夫是党内最大的走资派，是资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的代理人。他和他的老祖宗一样，是一个典型的历史唯心主义者。他一贯宣扬反动透顶的“工具”论，恶毒地污蔑人民群众“是活工具”。他说：“牛马是活工具”，“人更是活工具”。看，这是多么恶毒的污蔑！中国赫鲁晓夫赤裸裸地暴露出他极端敌视人民群众的反革命本质。
    我们伟大导师毛主席对人民群众的历史作用作出了极高的评价，“群众是真正的英雄”，“人民群众的创造力是无穷无尽的”。这是一切马列主义者对待人民群众应有的态度。
    一切剥削阶级都毫无例外地把人民群众当作他们的工具。奴隶主把奴隶看作“会说话的工具”，封建地主把农民看作“牛马”，资本家把工人看作为他们创造利润的“机器”。中国赫鲁晓夫站在奴隶主、封建主和资本家的反动立场上，把人民群众看作“活工具”。早在十九世纪末，德国资产阶级唯心主义哲学家尼采就说过：“人类与其说是目的，不如说是手段”，“人类不过是供实验用的材料”。中国赫鲁晓夫的反动的“工具”论，不过是从资产阶级反动哲学家那里拣来的破烂货。他真不愧为剥削阶级的孝子贤孙。他胡说什么工人和农民具有“流氓性”、“保守性”、“落后性”。他把群众看作是无知的“群氓”，把自己打扮成“救世主”，重复了几千年来剥削阶级的无耻滥调。
    中国赫鲁晓夫是一个反共反人民的大野心家、大阴谋家。他的“工具”论，就是为他篡党篡国制造的反革命舆论。所谓“工具”论，就是要训练奴隶精神，实行愚民政策，扼杀人民群众的革命造反精神，妄想使人民群众成为俯首听命的奴隶，成为他任意摆布的“工具”。他的黑《修养》，就是要人“修”成不要革命、不要无产阶级专政的糊涂虫，“修”成他复辟资本主义的“驯服工具”。他疯狂叫嚷道：只准作“驯服的工具”、“容易驾驭的工具”，不许作“调皮的工具”、“不容易驾驭的工具”，这完全是奴隶主的腔调。为了颠覆无产阶级专政，在中国复辟资本主义，他甚至公开嚎叫“如果中国党内发生了赫鲁晓夫政变”，人们也要服从。图穷匕首见，中国赫鲁晓夫露出了他狰狞的反革命面目。原来他的“活工具”、“驯服工具”，统统是为他搞反革命政变服务的。如果让中国赫鲁晓夫的阴谋得逞，中国便会出现资本主义复辟，人类就会出现历史的大倒退，千百万革命人民就会人头落地。这是一幅多么危险的情景啊！
    坚决依靠和密切联系人民群众，加强无产阶级专政，推动历史前进
    革命的根本问题是政权问题。两条路线的斗争，归根结底，是夺取政权和反对夺取政权，巩固无产阶级专政和颠覆无产阶级专政的斗争。毛主席教导我们：专政是群众的专政。因此，对待群众的态度，就是对待无产阶级专政的态度。保护群众，就是巩固无产阶级专政；镇压群众，就是破坏和颠覆无产阶级专政。要巩固无产阶级专政，必须坚决执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，相信群众，依靠群众，发动群众，坚决支持和保护革命的群众运动，保护广大人民群众。同时还必须坚决镇压阶级敌人。对敌人的宽容，就是对人民的残忍。只有对党内一小撮死不改悔的走资派以及叛徒、特务和地、富、反、坏、右等国民党反动派的残渣余孽实行专政，坚决镇压，才能巩固无产阶级的政权，才能真正保护人民群众。
    中国赫鲁晓夫站在国民党反动派的立场上，为了颠覆无产阶级专政，复辟资本主义，对人民的敌人百般包庇和保护，而对广大人民群众，对革命的群众运动则疯狂地破坏和镇压。对待群众运动，他一贯鼓吹和推行“自发”论和“控制”论，就是为了破坏和镇压革命群众运动，对人民群众实行资产阶级专政。
    中国赫鲁晓夫鼓吹什么：我们“必须而且主要是依靠群众的自发运动。……我们不应害怕这样的自发运动；我们正需要这样的自发运动，应加以鼓励和促成”，群众“要怎么办就怎么办”。这种“自发论”实际上是资产阶级麻醉革命人民的“鸦片”，是破坏人民群众革命运动的手段。
    马克思列宁主义认为，革命的群众运动，必须在思想上、政治上、组织上有正确的领导，才能取得彻底胜利。毛主席教导我们：“在马克思主义看来，理论是重要的，它的重要性充分地表现在列宁说过的一句话：‘没有革命的理论，就不会有革命的运动。’”但是，革命理论不是由群众“自发”产生的。“自发运动”只能产生工联主义思想，产生经济主义、改良主义的思想，不能产生科学的社会主义和共产主义思想。社会主义和共产主义的革命理论，是由代表无产阶级和广大劳动人民根本利益的革命导师，集中人类最优秀的思想，总结革命斗争经验创造出来的。战无不胜的毛泽东思想，是当代最高水平的马克思列宁主义，最伟大的革命真理，是在新的历史条件下代表无产阶级和劳动人民利益的最优秀的思想。只有把毛泽东思想灌输到工农群众中去，提高人民的思想觉悟，才能使革命群众运动变为自觉的政治斗争，才能夺取政权，建立无产阶级专政，并把无产阶级专政条件下的阶级斗争进行到底，取得彻底的解放。中国赫鲁晓夫宣扬“自发”论，其恶毒用意是反对用伟大的毛泽东思想武装群众，指导革命的群众运动，妄图用资产阶级的腐朽思想腐蚀群众，破坏革命的群众运动，把群众运动引向他复辟资本主义的歧途。
      “自发”论的反动性还在于它在组织上反对党对革命群众运动的领导。无产阶级的革命群众运动离开马克思列宁主义政党的领导，就一定会陷入歧途，葬送无产阶级的革命事业。中国赫鲁晓夫宣扬“自发”论，宣扬“群众要怎么办就怎么办”的无政府主义谬论，其实质并不是不要领导，不要政府，只不过是不要共产党的领导，不要无产阶级的政府，而要国民党的领导，要资产阶级的政府。鼓吹“自发论”，就是要破坏革命的群众运动，就是要对革命的群众运动实行资产阶级专政。
    中国赫鲁晓夫这个大工贼，历来就是镇压革命群众运动的罪魁祸首。为了镇压群众，压制革命的群众运动，他除使用“自发”论外，还不断使用“控制”论这个大棒。他疯狂叫嚣：“对群众运动，一定要在领导上控制得住。”
    中国赫鲁晓夫的“控制”论，是和毛主席亲手制定的“放手发动群众”，把党的路线、方针、政策交给群众，“让群众自己起来革命，自己教育自己，自己管理自己，自己解放自己”的革命路线针锋相对的。他的反动的“控制”论，就是国民党反动派的“训政”，就是要把革命群众“控制”在资产阶级的轨道之内，“控制”在他的反革命修正主义路线的框框之内。“控制”就是镇压。不允许越他的资产阶级反动路线的框框一步，否则就立即镇压。“控制”群众，“运动”群众，这是中国赫鲁晓夫镇压革命群众运动的一贯伎俩。
    无产阶级的革命群众运动，必须要有共产党的领导，但是这种革命的领导和中国赫鲁晓夫反革命的“控制”，是有着本质的区别的。毛主席教导我们：“党和群众的关系的问题，应当是：凡属人民群众的正确的意见，党必须依据情况，领导群众，加以实现；而对于人民群众中发生的不正确的意见，则必须教育群众，加以改正”，“必须善于把我们队伍中的小资产阶级思想引导到无产阶级革命的轨道”。集中群众的正确意见，领导群众加以实现，教育群众认识无产阶级和广大劳动人民群众的根本利益，把党的方针、政策交给群众，充分相信和依靠群众，尊重群众的首创精神，保护群众的积极性，引导群众自己教育自己，自己解放自己，这就是党对群众运动的领导。而中国赫鲁晓夫的“控制”论，则是为了束缚群众，压制革命群众运动，使群众成为供他驱使的“奴隶”，为他的复辟资本主义的企图效劳。
      “自发”论和“控制”论，这是一切剥削阶级和新老修正主义、机会主义破坏和镇压革命群众运动所采用的一贯手法。在中国革命的历次重大关头，中国赫鲁晓夫都妄图用“自发”论和“控制”论的反革命两手，扑灭革命群众运动的熊熊烈火，达到他的反革命目的。他用“自发”论鼓动资产阶级对无产阶级进攻，又用“控制”论压制无产阶级对资产阶级反击。他的全部历史就是不断用“自发”论和“控制”论这两手，破坏和镇压革命群众运动的罪恶史。一九二七年，他追随陈独秀投降主义路线，勒令武汉工人纠察队向国民党交出几千支枪，解散工人纠察队，把轰轰烈烈的群众运动扑灭了下去。随后，他又在工人运动中大肆鼓吹“自发”论，反对工人进行政治斗争，要把工人运动引到经济主义的邪路上去。一九四七年，他提出一条“群众要怎么办就怎么办”，“超越党支部，进行搬石头，踢开区村干部”的形“左”实右的反动路线，与毛主席规定的“上级派到乡村的工作团或工作组，必须首先团结当地党的支部组织内的一切积极分子和较好分子，共同领导当地的土地改革工作”的革命路线相对抗，破坏党的土地改革运动。一九五五年，全国亿万农民群众在毛主席亲自领导下，开始掀起农业合作化高潮时，中国赫鲁晓夫和他的同伙背着毛主席，挥起魔刀，大砍合作社，残酷地镇压伟大的农民革命运动。一九六三年，他又猖狂破坏社会主义教育运动，派出他的老婆资产阶级分子王××到桃园大队进行所谓“蹲点”，大搞神秘化的“扎根串连”，大搞“群众洗手洗澡”，把斗争矛头指向广大贫下中农和革命干部，打击一大片，保护一小撮，并抛出全面破坏社会主义教育运动的“桃园经验”，向全国推广，有目的、有计划地实行资本主义复辟。
    我们最高统帅毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命，是最伟大的革命群众运动。中国赫鲁晓夫预感到末日的来临，更加疯狂地打起“控制”论和“自发”论两面破黑旗，妄想扼杀这场势不可挡的革命群众运动。无产阶级文化大革命群众运动轰轰烈烈发动起来以后，中国赫鲁晓夫大搞“控制”论，派出大量工作组，划框框，定调调，对革命群众实行资产阶级专政。他颠倒是非，混淆黑白，“围剿”革命派，压制不同意见，实行白色恐怖，把大批革命群众打成“反革命”、“右派”，妄图把轰轰烈烈的无产阶级文化大革命运动打下去。当毛主席领导亿万革命群众，揭穿、批判中国赫鲁晓夫的资产阶级反动路线时，他和他的同伙又打出无政府主义的破旗，提出“怀疑一切，打倒一切”的反革命口号，大刮经济主义妖风。他再一次妄图用形“左”实右的“自发”论，破坏无产阶级文化大革命。然而，螳臂挡车不自量，蚍蜉撼树谈何易。我们伟大领袖毛主席亲自发动和领导的史无前例的革命群众运动，清算了中国赫鲁晓夫的资产阶级反动路线，宣判了中国赫鲁晓夫的政治死刑。
                  ＊　＊　＊
    毛主席教导我们：“党组织应是无产阶级先进分子所组成，应能领导无产阶级和革命群众对于阶级敌人进行战斗的朝气蓬勃的先锋队组织。”毛主席这一最新指示，极为深刻地指出了无产阶级革命党的根本性质。根据毛主席的教导，我们党在新的历史条件下，在无产阶级掌握革命政权的情况下，必须继续保持和发扬积极保护群众、紧密联系群众的优良作风，率领无产阶级和广大人民群众不停顿地、又稳又准又狠地打击一小撮阶级敌人，才能永葆朝气蓬勃的革命青春，才能把革命进行到底。
    伟大领袖毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命，大大发扬我党保护群众、紧密联系群众的革命作风和群众路线的优良革命传统。我国亿万无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众，在毛主席革命路线的指引下，高举“对反动派造反有理”的大旗，发扬革命首创精神，彻底摧垮了隐藏在我们党内的以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的反共反人民的资产阶级司令部，批判了他们所推行的反革命修正主义路线，大立了毛泽东思想，建立了新的革命权力机构——革命委员会。无产阶级文化大革命取得了政治上、思想上、组织上的伟大胜利。
    中国赫鲁晓夫这个反革命修正主义的总头目，一贯顽固地站在与人民为敌的立场上，用反革命的“工具”论、“自发”论、“控制”论，疯狂破坏和残酷镇压革命群众运动，搞一套国民党作风，妄图阻止历史车轮滚滚向前。但是，在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，他的鬼蜮伎俩遭到了可耻的失败。
    历史的辩证法就是这样，谁反对革命的群众运动，谁反对毛泽东思想，谁反对毛主席的革命路线，不管他怎样狡猾，终究逃不脱灭亡的命运。中国赫鲁晓夫这个一贯疯狂镇压革命群众运动、反对毛主席革命路线的老反革命，终究没有逃脱历史的惩罚。这个曾经显赫一时的“大人物”，不过是一个令人嗤笑的历史小丑而已！
    让我们高高举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，发扬我党紧密联系群众的优良作风，坚定地和广大革命群众在一起，彻底批判中国赫鲁晓夫破坏和镇压革命群众运动的反动谬论，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利！
