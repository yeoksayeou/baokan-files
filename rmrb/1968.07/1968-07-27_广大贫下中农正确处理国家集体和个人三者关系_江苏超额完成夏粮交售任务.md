The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres in the rural areas of Jiangsu, with boundless love for the great leader Chairman Mao, enthusiastically turned in grain to the state. By July 20, they had already overfulfilled this year's summer grain procurement task by 8.5%.

Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production," and with the support of the People's Liberation Army, through the arduous struggle of the poor and lower-middle peasant community members, Jiangsu's more than 3,500,000 mu of summer crops achieved a bumper harvest. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres, following Chairman Mao's teachings of "prepare for war, prepare for famine, and serve the people" and "in the matter of distribution, we must consider the interests of the state, the collective, and the individual," began to harvest, thresh, dry, and turn in grain to the state as soon as the summer grain ripened, launching a wave of turning in summer grain to the state. Many production teams completed this year's summer grain procurement task in just a few days.

"Navigating the vast ocean relies on the helmsman; carrying out revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought." In completing the summer grain procurement task, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres in various places in Jiangsu emphasized proletarian politics, held various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, quickly implemented Chairman Mao's latest instructions and related teachings, correctly handled the relationships among the state, collective, and individual, and actively and enthusiastically sold more surplus grain to the state. The poor and lower-middle peasants of Baoying County's Caodian People's Commune, who achieved a summer crop increase, completed the summer grain procurement task in three days and then sold an additional 600,000-plus jin of surplus grain to the state.

The poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres in the rural areas of various places in Jiangsu firmly remember Chairman Mao's teaching of "never forget class struggle," using the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, treating the fields, threshing grounds, and state grain procurement stations as battlefields, and combining the actual class struggle in their localities to launch a fierce attack on the counter-revolutionary revisionist black goods promoted by the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in grain work. At the same time, they severely struck down the class enemies who disrupted the grain procurement work, greatly raising their awareness of class struggle and line struggle, and ensuring the overfulfillment of the summer grain procurement task.

    广大贫下中农正确处理国家集体和个人三者关系
    江苏超额完成夏粮交售任务
    新华社南京二十六日电　江苏农村广大贫下中农和革命干部，怀着对伟大领袖毛主席的无限热爱，踊跃向国家交售粮食，到七月二十日已超额百分之八点五完成了今年的夏粮交售任务。
    在毛主席“抓革命，促生产”伟大方针指引下，在人民解放军的支援下，经过贫下中农社员群众的艰苦斗争，江苏三千五百多万亩夏熟作物获得了丰收。广大贫下中农和革命干部，遵循毛主席“备战、备荒、为人民”和“在分配问题上，我们必须兼顾国家利益、集体利益和个人利益”的教导，夏粮一成熟，就边收割，边脱粒，边整晒，边交售，掀起了向国家交售夏粮的热潮。许多生产队只用几天时间，就突击完成了今年的夏粮交售任务。
      “大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想。”江苏各地广大贫下中农和革命干部在完成夏粮交售任务中，大力突出无产阶级政治，大办各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，迅速落实了毛主席的最新指示和有关的教导，正确处理了国家、集体和个人三者的关系，积极踊跃地向国家多卖余粮。获得夏熟增产的宝应县曹甸公社贫下中农，在三天内完成了夏粮交售任务之后，接着又向国家多卖了余粮六十万多斤。
    江苏各地农村贫下中农和革命干部牢记毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的教导，以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，将田头、场头、国家粮食收购站作为战场，结合当地阶级斗争的实际，狠批了中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人在粮食工作方面所推行的反革命修正主义黑货，同时狠狠打击了破坏粮食征购工作的阶级敌人，大大提高了阶级斗争和路线斗争觉悟，保证了夏粮交售任务的超额完成。（附图片）
