Art is for the people. It must have its deepest roots in the broad masses of laboring people. It must be understood and loved by these masses. It must combine with the feelings, thoughts, and will of these masses and elevate them. — Lenin

    艺术是属于人民的。它必须在广大劳动群众的底层有其最深厚的根基。它必须为这些群众所了解和爱好。它必须结合这些群众的感情、思想和意志，并提高他们。——列宁
