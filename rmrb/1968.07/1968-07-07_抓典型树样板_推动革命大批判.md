Members of the Yiqing County Revolutionary Committee in Shanxi Province have gone deep into the grassroots and among the masses, summarized and exchanged good experiences created by the masses, and promptly promoted them. The flames of revolutionary criticism throughout the county have burned more fiercely, launching more intense attacks on class enemies. The revolutionary and production situation is better than ever.

The great leader Chairman Mao recently pointed out profoundly: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is, in essence, a great political revolution carried out by the proletariat under the conditions of socialism, a continuation of the long-term struggle between the Chinese Communist Party and the Kuomintang reactionaries under the leadership of the broad revolutionary masses of the people, and a continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie." As soon as this latest directive from Chairman Mao was issued, the standing committee members of the Yiqing County Revolutionary Committee went deep into the grassroots. In various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, they studied Chairman Mao's latest directive together with the masses, summarized the experiences of the previous stage of revolutionary criticism, and analyzed the new trends, characteristics, and problems of class struggle. On the basis of greatly enhancing the class struggle consciousness and line struggle awareness of the broad revolutionary masses, the members of the Revolutionary Committee fully mobilized the masses, thoroughly investigated the crimes and plots of stubborn class enemies, and investigated the sabotage activities of traitors, spies, and unrepentant landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists. Therefore, the lid of class struggle in various units was further lifted. The broad revolutionary masses were spirited and full of fighting spirit, digging out one by one the hidden traitors, spies, and other counter-revolutionary elements, and carried out powerful criticism and struggle against them, implementing the dictatorship of the masses, and promoting the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in the county to develop continuously in depth.

In the face of deepening class struggle, the members of the Yiqing County Revolutionary Committee, who have gone deep into the front lines of class struggle, followed Chairman Mao's teaching: "Any leading comrade who does not gain specific experience from individual units and individual persons in the lower levels must not be able to provide universal guidance to all units." They combined general mobilization with specific guidance, seized typical examples, set models, and promptly guided the cultural revolution movement throughout the county. They summarized the experience of Qiaoshang Commune in using class struggle as the key to deeply carry out revolutionary criticism in various types of study classes, and promptly convened a conference with the participation of more than 500 people, including leaders of revolutionary leading groups at the brigade level, militia cadres, poor and lower-middle peasants representatives, and leaders of county-level organs, schools, and factories, to promote the experience of Qiaoshang Commune.

To strengthen the guidance of the movement throughout the county, the members of the County Revolutionary Committee insisted on fighting side by side with the masses, serving both as fighters and commanders, and promptly discovered new problems in the development of the movement. After discovering problems, they immediately studied Chairman Mao's works and latest directives with the revolutionary masses in the study classes, using Mao Zedong Thought to solve these problems. Therefore, the revolutionary criticism and struggle against enemies in this county have developed wave upon wave, layer upon layer, in depth along the direction indicated by Chairman Mao. For example, some units had exposed a handful of class enemies and thought they had been overthrown, leaving them aside without promptly organizing struggle sessions; some only exposed the sabotage activities of class enemies in their own units without effectively combining it with the criticism of the Chinese Khrushchev and other top capitalist roaders within the Party. After discovering this situation, the members of the County Revolutionary Committee studied in the study classes with the revolutionary masses Chairman Mao's theory, line, policies, and principles on continuing the revolution under the conditions of proletarian dictatorship, and his brilliant works such as "Carry the Revolution Through to the End." Through study, everyone had a clearer understanding that only by thoroughly criticizing the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party and other class enemies politically, ideologically, and theoretically, can they be completely overthrown and the rightist reversal wind thoroughly smashed. Therefore, they adopted methods such as "seeing how Chinese Khrushchev spreads fallacies, how his agents carry them out, and how unrepentant landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists respond," and while struggling against class enemies in their own units, they combined it with the criticism of Chinese Khrushchev's "exploitation is meritorious," "class struggle is extinguished," "three autonomies and one contract," "four freedoms," and other revisionist black goods. The masses felt that this way of struggle had targets, the criticism had content, the upper and lower levels were closely linked, the fallacies were deeply criticized, the crimes were thoroughly exposed, and the poison was thoroughly purged. Some units had not combined the criticism of revisionism with the struggle against selfishness. The members of the County Revolutionary Committee, in response to this problem, studied in the study classes with the revolutionary masses Chairman Mao's great teaching of "fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism" repeatedly. Everyone had a deeper understanding that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a great revolution that touches people's souls. Only by combining the struggle against selfishness with the criticism of revisionism, breaking selfishness and establishing public spirit, and changing one's worldview, can the root of revisionism be uprooted, and a steel wall of anti-revisionism and prevention of revisionism be built in one's mind. The broad poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary masses raised their revolutionary consciousness of hating, exposing, and struggling against selfishness, combined with the great criticism, fiercely struggled against the bourgeois "self," and realized the revolutionization of thought. The poor and lower-middle peasants deeply felt: "Without struggling against selfishness, people will become revisionist; without criticizing revisionism, power will be lost. Only by continuously struggling against selfishness and criticizing revisionism can we ensure that our socialist state will never change color."

In the process of going deep into the grassroots and mobilizing the masses to carry out revolutionary criticism and struggle against enemies, the members of this county's Revolutionary Committee also paid special attention to arming the masses with the great Mao Zedong Thought and the Party's policies, continuously raising the policy level of the broad revolutionary masses, and thus ensuring the victory of the movement. They had previously held study classes and studied with the masses Chairman Mao's series of directives on the struggle against enemies and his brilliant work "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People." In the struggle against enemies, the broad poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary masses seriously implemented the Party's policies, strictly distinguished between the two types of contradictions, united all revolutionary forces that could be united, continuously expanded the revolutionary ranks, and maximized the isolation of class enemies, striking a handful of class enemies steadily, accurately, and fiercely.

Currently, under the leadership of the County Revolutionary Committee, the revolutionary criticism and struggle against enemies in Yiqing County are deepening step by step, achieving one victory after another. The revolution has promoted production. This year, the cotton and autumn crops in this county were sown early and managed well, with full and strong seedlings, and good growth.

    抓典型树样板　推动革命大批判
    山西省翼城县革委会成员深入基层，深入群众，总结交流和推广群众创造的好经验，全县革命大批判的烈火越烧越旺，革命和生产形势空前大好
    新华社太原六日电　山西省翼城县革命委员会成员，深入基层，深入群众，总结和交流群众创造的好经验，并及时加以推广，把全县革命大批判的烈火越烧越旺，向阶级敌人发起更加猛烈的进攻，稳、准、狠地打击了一小撮阶级敌人。现在，这个县的革命洪流滚滚向前，农业生产热气腾腾，到处是一片空前大好形势。
    伟大领袖毛主席最近深刻地指出：“无产阶级文化大革命，实质上是在社会主义条件下，无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命，是中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续，是无产阶级和资产阶级阶级斗争的继续。”毛主席这一最新指示一发表，翼城县革委会的常委们就深入基层，在各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班里，同群众一起学习毛主席的最新指示，一起总结前一阶段开展革命大批判的经验，一起分析阶级斗争的新动向、新特点、新问题。在广大革命群众阶级斗争观念和路线斗争觉悟大大提高的基础上，革委会成员放手地、充分地发动群众，深入清查顽固不化的走资派的罪行和阴谋活动，清查叛徒、特务和没有改造好的地、富、反、坏、右分子的破坏活动，因而进一步揭开了各单位阶级斗争的盖子。广大革命群众精神振奋，斗志昂扬，把一小撮隐藏的叛徒、特务和其他反革命分子一个个地挖出来，对他们进行了有力的批判斗争，实行了群众专政，推动全县无产阶级文化大革命不断向纵深发展。
    在阶级斗争越来越深入的情况下，深入到阶级斗争第一线的翼城县革命委员会成员，遵循毛主席“任何领导人员，凡不从下级个别单位的个别人员、个别事件取得具体经验者，必不能向一切单位作普遍的指导”的教导，把一般号召和具体指导结合起来，抓典型，树样板，及时指导全县的文化大革命运动。他们和革命群众一起，总结了桥上公社在各种类型的学习班里以阶级斗争为纲，深入开展革命大批判的经验，并且及时召开有大队革命领导班子负责人、民兵干部、贫下中农代表以及县直机关、学校、厂矿领导班子负责人共五百多人参加的现场会，推广了桥上公社的经验。
    为了加强对全县运动的指导，县革命委员会成员坚持同群众并肩战斗，既当战斗员，又当指挥员，及时发现运动发展中的新问题。他们发现问题以后，就立即和革命群众一起，在学习班里活学活用毛主席著作和最新指示，用毛泽东思想解决这些问题，因而使这个县的革命大批判和对敌斗争，沿着毛主席指引的方向，一浪高过一浪、一层深入一层地向纵深发展。譬如，有些单位揪出了一小撮阶级敌人，就以为打倒了，搁在一边没有及时组织批斗；有的只停留在揭发本单位阶级敌人的破坏活动上，没有和批判中国赫鲁晓夫等党内最大一小撮走资派很好地结合起来。县革命委员会成员发现这种情况后，就在学习班里和革命群众一起，进一步学习毛主席关于在无产阶级专政条件下继续进行革命的理论、路线、方针和政策，学习毛主席的《将革命进行到底》等光辉著作。经过学习，大家更加明确地认识到，只有把党内一小撮走资派等阶级敌人从政治上、思想上、理论上批深批透，批倒批臭，才能把他们彻底打倒，彻底粉碎右倾翻案妖风。于是，他们采取“看中国赫鲁晓夫是怎样散布谬论的，他的代理人是怎样执行的，没有改造好的地、富、反、坏、右分子等阶级敌人是怎样呼应的”等方法，在批斗本单位阶级敌人的同时，结合批判中国赫鲁晓夫的“剥削有功”、“阶级斗争熄灭”论、“三自一包”、“四大自由”等反革命修正主义黑货。群众认为，这样斗有对象，批有内容，上下联得紧，谬论批得深，罪恶揭得透，流毒肃得清。有的单位没有把批修和斗私结合起来，县革命委员会成员针对这个问题，就在学习班里和革命群众一起，反复学习毛主席“要斗私，批修”的伟大教导，大家更加深刻地认识到，无产阶级文化大革命是一场触及人们灵魂的大革命，只有把斗私和批修结合起来，破私立公，改造世界观，才能挖掉修正主义根子，在思想上筑起反修防修的钢铁长城。广大贫下中农和革命群众提高了恨私、亮私、斗私的革命自觉性，结合大批判，狠斗资产阶级“私”字，实现思想革命化。贫下中农深有体会地说：“不斗私，人要修，不批修，权要丢。不断斗私批修，才能保证咱们的社会主义江山永不变色。”
    这个县的革委会成员，在深入基层放手发动群众开展革命大批判和对敌斗争的过程中，还特别注意用伟大的毛泽东思想和党的政策武装群众，不断提高广大革命群众的政策水平，从而保证了运动的胜利发展。他们曾经通过举办学习班，和群众一起深入学习毛主席关于对敌斗争的一系列指示，学习毛主席的光辉著作《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》。在对敌斗争中，广大贫下中农和革命群众认真执行党的政策，严格区分两类不同性质的矛盾，团结一切可以团结的革命力量，不断壮大革命的队伍，把阶级敌人最大限度地孤立起来，稳、准、狠地打击了一小撮阶级敌人。
    目前在县革命委员会的领导下，翼城县的革命大批判和对敌斗争步步深入，夺得一个又一个胜利。革命推动了生产。今年这个县的棉花和大秋作物播种得早，管理得好，苗全苗壮，长势喜人。
