The great leader Chairman Mao recently pointed out profoundly: "Universities must still be run, and I am mainly talking about universities of science and engineering. However, the system must be shortened, education must be revolutionized, and proletarian politics must be in command. Follow the path of Shanghai Machine Tool Factory in cultivating technical personnel from among workers. Select students from workers and peasants with practical experience, let them study in school for a few years, and then return to production practice." The publication of Chairman Mao's latest instructions has greatly inspired the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers in Shanghai, the source of the "January Revolution" storm. They are more excited the more they study, their hearts are brighter the more they study, and their revolutionary spirit is more ardent the more they study. They excitedly say, Chairman Mao's great call has greatly boosted the morale of us workers, peasants, and soldiers, and has greatly dampened the arrogance of the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes. Chairman Mao's latest instructions declare the complete bankruptcy of the bourgeois education system and the counter-revolutionary revisionist education line of China's Khrushchev, and open up the broadest path for the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers to cultivate their own intellectuals. They cheer: Chairman Mao's latest instructions are the battle program to carry the proletarian educational revolution to the end, a hundred-year strategy to oppose revisionism and prevent revisionism, and our most beloved great leader Mao Zedong's new development of Marxism-Leninism. The immeasurable significance of Chairman Mao's latest instructions will be increasingly fully revealed with the development of revolutionary practice.

The broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers in Shanghai, with hearts full of boundless love and loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, are currently extensively and deeply studying Chairman Mao's great instructions. On the 24th, reporters from this newspaper invited some representatives of Shanghai's workers, peasants, and soldiers to discuss Chairman Mao's latest instructions. Below is the summary of the speeches at the discussion meeting.

The Eighth Company of Nanjing Road is an outstanding company that has grown up under the nurturing of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. This company is a great school. Over the years, this company has cultivated a large number of talented and virtuous cadres. At the discussion meeting, the platoon leader of the Fourth Platoon, Shao Jinceng, said:

Chairman Mao's Latest Instructions
Are a Hundred-Year Strategy to Oppose Revisionism and Prevent Revisionism

We enthusiastically support and resolutely implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions. Before the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, under the rule of China's Khrushchev's counter-revolutionary revisionist education line, under the control of bourgeois intellectuals, schools excluded workers, peasants, and soldiers. The students cultivated were detached from proletarian politics, from the masses of workers and peasants, and from production practice. Such schools could not cultivate successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause; they could only cultivate "spiritual aristocrats" who stand above the masses. The educational cause of the proletariat must, as Chairman Mao teaches, "thoroughly change the phenomenon of bourgeois intellectuals ruling our schools" and "follow the path of Shanghai Machine Tool Factory in cultivating technical personnel from among workers," "select students from workers and peasants with practical experience, let them study in school for a few years, and then return to production practice." Only in this way can we cultivate "socialist-conscious laborers with culture"; only in this way can we prevent revisionism and prevent the restoration of capitalism.

Cultivating technical personnel from among workers and cultivating successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause from among workers and peasants with practical experience is a consistent thought of our great leader Chairman Mao. The People's Liberation Army, personally created and nurtured by Chairman Mao, has been doing this for decades. In the past war years, our army produced many outstanding military leaders and excellent commanders. They, under the brilliant leadership of Chairman Mao, led the troops to defeat hundreds of thousands of Kuomintang bandits. They had never attended any military academy; some were originally peasants with hoes on their shoulders, and some were illiterate cowherds who did not know how to fight. They learned warfare from warfare and, through many years of revolutionary warfare practice, became excellent military cadres of the Party.

After liberation, our army, under the leadership of the great commander Chairman Mao, also cultivated a large number of excellent cadres. Reviewing the growth process of our Eighth Company, we feel particularly close to Chairman Mao's latest instructions. Over the past decade, our Eighth Company has been like a school, cultivating batch after batch of cadres. Not counting those who have gone to work in the local areas, there are dozens of them still working in the army. Some are now political commissars of regiments, some are political instructors of battalions, and some are political instructors, platoon leaders, and squad leaders of companies. They are loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. They also have rich practical work experience and can always be one with the soldiers, so they are universally welcomed by the broad masses of soldiers. They did not attend any school but grew and tempered themselves in Mao Zedong Thought and in various practical struggles.

We deeply feel that the path of Shanghai Machine Tool Factory in cultivating technical personnel from among workers is the path to cultivating successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause. With successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause produced in practical struggles, our socialist ironclad mountains and rivers will never change color. We must unswervingly advance along the path indicated by Chairman Mao.

Yang Fuzhen is a worker from Shanghai No. 1 Cotton Mill. She has seen our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao many times. Before liberation, she was a poor peasant girl who suffered cruel exploitation by landlords and capitalists. With boundless proletarian feelings for Chairman Mao and the Communist Party, and with boundless love for socialism, she said excitedly at the discussion meeting:

We Need Intellectuals Who Listen to Chairman Mao's Words
And Are United with Workers and Peasants

Our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao always issues brilliant instructions at every critical moment of revolutionary victories, guiding us forward. Now, at this important moment when the billion revolutionary people of the whole country are striding forward and seizing the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, Chairman Mao has timely issued the latest instructions of great historical significance, formulating the battle program for us to carry the proletarian educational revolution to the end. I, a worker who started as a child laborer, once again feel the greatness and brilliance of our heart's red sun, Chairman Mao! I want to shout a thousand and ten thousand times: Long live Chairman Mao! Long live! Long live for ten thousand years!

Chairman Mao's latest instructions are the sharpest weapon to thoroughly smash the bourgeois education system and the beacon to cultivate successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause. Intellectuals cultivated according to Chairman Mao's teachings are the intellectuals of our working class. They listen to Chairman Mao's words, are willing to and actually unite with workers and peasants, combine theory with practice, do not seek personal gain, and wholeheartedly serve the people of China and the world.

Under the nurturing of Mao Zedong Thought and the brilliant illumination of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, our country has produced many revolutionary intellectuals. I have met some such people. They strive to change themselves according to Chairman Mao's instructions, go deep into the masses of workers, regard workers as their teachers, study, work, and fight together with workers, and gradually shake off the influence of the revisionist education line, becoming one heart with workers. Their technical knowledge combined with production practice has played a great role in production. In this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, they have withstood the test of storms and waves. We workers like such intellectuals. However, under the influence of China's Khrushchev's revisionist education line, there are also many intellectuals who only want to make a name for themselves, do not want to unite with the masses of workers and peasants, are detached from reality, from labor, and from the masses, and still think they are great, looking down on us workers. For example, some "instructors" who came out of school, when they came to the workshop, talked big but could not "instruct" and had to ask workers to help them operate the machine. I also met such an intellectual: she had a big attitude, did not do dirty work, did not do heavy work, but pointed fingers at workers. These intellectuals are deeply poisoned by revisionism. We hope they will put down their airs, strive to change themselves, and quickly catch up with the majestic steps of the billion revolutionary people advancing forward.

The Denglou Brigade of Beiqiao Commune in the suburbs of Shanghai is an advanced unit in Shanghai for studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought. In the past few days, the poor and lower-middle peasants of this brigade, with boundless loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, held a study class and seriously studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions. At the discussion meeting, the Party branch secretary of this brigade, Lu Shunlong, said:

Cultivate People Who Satisfy the Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants
In the Struggle of Class Struggles

Chairman Mao's latest instructions really hit the hearts of us poor and lower-middle peasants. We poor and lower-middle peasants have long hated China's Khrushchev's counter-revolutionary revisionist education line. This revisionist education line leads our children to the wrong path of being detached from proletarian politics, from the masses of workers and peasants, and from production practice. Our Denglou Brigade had some young people poisoned by China's Khrushchev's revisionist education line a few years ago. They, after graduating from school, could not do manual work, did not want to farm, and were reluctant to work when arranged to do so. They wanted to go to the city to find a job every three or five days. We poor and lower-middle peasants were both angry and sad about them. Take a high school graduate, for example. In 1962, he returned from school, and the poor and lower-middle peasants thought he was the most educated person in the team, happily electing him as the accountant. However, he thought returning to the team to work was a "loss," although he reluctantly became the accountant, he could not figure out how to keep accounts and calculate. He did not know how to use an abacus and was afraid to lose face, so he did not dare to ask others. At the end of the month, account settlement, other teams' "little accountants" who had not read many books could click the abacus fluently, but he was still drawing Arabic numerals on one sheet of paper after another. We poor and lower-middle peasants call such people "theoretical but not practical." The old education system of revisionism is really harmful.

Chairman Mao has long taught us: "Successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause are produced in the struggles of the masses and grow up in the tempering of revolutionary storms and waves." The proletariat must cultivate its own talents, making them take the main course of class struggle, actively study and apply Mao Zedong Thought, bravely throw themselves into the fiery class struggle, and follow the path of uniting with workers and peasants. Our brigade, in this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, launched a mass movement to study and apply Mao Zedong Thought. Mao Zedong Thought study classes were not only held in the brigade and production teams but also in every household of the poor and lower-middle peasants. Mao Zedong Thought has entered people's hearts. Everyone, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, set up revolutionary criticism and struggle battlefields in the fields, courtyards, and homes, and one by one, took out China's Khrushchev's various counter-revolutionary revisionist fallacies to criticize and refute them fiercely. In this great study, great criticism, and great struggle, the class struggle and two-line struggle consciousness of the revolutionary masses of the whole brigade has been further heightened, and some young people poisoned by the revisionist education line have changed. That high school graduate, for example, seems to have become a new person. The poor and lower-middle peasants happily said, just as Chairman Mao teaches, "Class struggle, once grasped, is effective." Using Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, launching revolutionary criticism, and bringing young people poisoned by China's Khrushchev's revisionism back to Chairman Mao's revolutionary path.

In the past few days, we poor and lower-middle peasants, while studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions, have become more and more happy. From the changes in some young people in our brigade, we concretely feel that the great leader Chairman Mao's latest instructions are indeed a thousand-year and ten-thousand-year strategy to make our socialist mountains and rivers never change color. Under the guidance of this instruction of great historical significance, we will surely break the old bourgeois education system, and the new proletarian education system will surely be established victoriously, cultivating millions and millions of successors who satisfy us poor and lower-middle peasants.

Cai Zucuan is an expert in electric light sources who started as a glass worker. Lu Agou was originally a worker from the state-owned Shanghai Second Textile Machinery Factory, a technical innovation enthusiast, and a national labor model. Later, he went to the Shanghai Agricultural Science Institute's Agricultural Machinery Research Institute to engage in research work. In many years of scientific practice, they have been savagely persecuted and attacked by a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party and reactionary academic "authorities" of the bourgeoisie. At the discussion meeting, they said:

Following the Path of Shanghai Machine Tool Factory
Is a Fierce Class Struggle

They said, Chairman Mao's latest instructions are the battle program for carrying out the proletarian educational revolution and also open up a broad path for the rapid development of scientific and technological undertakings in our country. The path of Shanghai Machine Tool Factory in cultivating technical personnel from among workers, pointed out by Chairman Mao, is completely opposed to China's Khrushchev's counter-revolutionary revisionist education line and counter-revolutionary revisionist scientific and technological line. The process of following the path of Shanghai Machine Tool Factory is the process of fierce struggle between two classes, two lines, and two paths.

Lu Agou said: Before liberation, China's textile machinery was all imported from Japan and other imperialist countries. In 1952, we several workers decided to fight for the honor of the Chinese working class and make China's single-ring large draft spinning frame. At that time, the capitalist roaders in the factory, together with a handful of reactionary academic "authorities" of the bourgeoisie, savagely persecuted us. They spread rumors attacking us, saying it was "nonsense," and talked nonsense about how "foreign high-level engineers had researched it for many years but could not make it, and you workers have low cultural levels and no theory, completely messing around." We wanted to experiment, but they did not give us funds, did not give us processed parts, and did not give us materials. It was not until 1954 that, with the strong support of the workers, the trial production was basically successful. The high-count yarn spun out was even better in quality than that spun out by the same type of Japanese-made spinning frame. They then played a new trick, bringing in some "experts" and "authorities" from outside the factory to "evaluate" it, and finally, in the name of "consolidating" and "improving" the machine, they put our research results into the cold storage.

In 1962, I went to work in Jiangxi and saw that in some places, plowing was still done by hand. I thought, the poor and lower-middle peasants are our class brothers, and we have the responsibility to help them reduce physical labor. I designed a vibrating plow based on the characteristics of Chinese farmers' ox plows. At that time, I was the deputy director of the state-owned Second Machinery Factory, and I decided to leave the factory and go to the Agricultural Machinery Institute to conduct research and experiments. When I arrived at the Agricultural Machinery Institute, a handful of capitalist roaders in the institute and the institute were completely skeptical, indifferent, and resistant to this research. They also adopted the "three nos" policy towards me: no tools, no materials, no workers, and only allowed me to experiment in a dilapidated warehouse. But this did not defeat me. I, together with other comrades, broke through numerous obstacles and made the trial production progress. A handful of capitalist roaders within the Party and reactionary academic "authorities" of the bourgeoisie spread various rumors, saying I wanted to "make a name," was a "toad wanting to eat swan meat." By the initial period of the Cultural Revolution in 1966, a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party were even more afraid that I would rebel against them, and they struck first, labeling me as a "counter-revolutionary." It was not until after the "January Revolution" that we seized the power of a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, and the revolutionary masses took power. The trial of the vibrating plow then made rapid progress. Now, the two large vibrating plows undergoing field trials have good plowing effects and are welcomed and praised by the masses. Reviewing the process of scientific research practice over the past decade, it is truly full of fierce struggles with a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party and reactionary academic "authorities" of the bourgeoisie. Every step forward was met with heavy resistance.

Cai Zucuan and Lu Agou excitedly said: Chairman Mao's latest instructions are like a lighthouse shining with rays of light, illuminating our path forward. However, to implement Chairman Mao's teachings, there will surely be fierce struggles. A handful of class enemies will surely resist fiercely, and the poison of China's Khrushchev's revisionist line and the old habits will surely become obstacles. Our experience is that we must implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions in struggles and defend Chairman Mao's latest instructions in struggles, resolutely follow the path indicated by Chairman Mao.

Recently, the Shanghai Third Steel Plant, in the overhaul project of the open-hearth furnace workshop, created a rare miracle in the history of lifting: two open-hearth furnace chimneys, each 55 meters high and weighing 230 tons, were not dismantled and rebuilt, nor were they laid down and then pulled to the new foundation to be erected again, but were moved vertically 31 meters and 40 meters respectively. The old workers participating in this project, such as Bao Baoxing and Li Songquan, said at the discussion meeting:

Following the Path of Shanghai Machine Tool Factory
Is the Only Way to Develop New Science and Technology

They said, such giant chimneys, adopting the method of "vertical displacement," cannot be found in any book. But this is actually a normal thing. Chairman Mao has long taught us: "Knowledge begins with practice," and "all true knowledge comes from direct experience." The knowledge in books is only the summary of the practice that predecessors have already done. If one clings to books, one cannot make discoveries, inventions, creations, and progress, and cannot solve new problems in practice.

In this overhaul of the open-hearth furnace, under the brilliant illumination of Mao Zedong Thought, we discarded all the outdated rules and regulations, broke superstitions, and were not intimidated by "experts" and "authorities." On the one hand, we dragged a handful of reactionary bourgeois technical "authorities" and unrepentant capitalist roaders to the construction site for criticism; on the other hand, we conducted in-depth and meticulous investigation and research, dared to imagine, and dared to practice, and finally created this displacement method, successfully completing the task. The entire displacement work took only 150 working hours, less than two days. If we had followed the old methods, it would have taken 1,500 working hours, more than 50 days. We deeply felt the mighty power of Mao Zedong Thought. Doing things according to Mao Zedong Thought, we are invincible.

We have recently studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions time and time again, and the more we study, the more we feel the greatness and brilliance of Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao has formulated the battle program for us to thoroughly smash the old bourgeois education system and establish a new proletarian education system. Advancing along the path indicated by Chairman Mao, we not only fundamentally guarantee that our proletarian revolutionary political power will forever firmly be in the hands of the proletariat but will also make our country's science and technology leap forward.

In this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the fallacies advocated by China's Khrushchev, such as "experts running factories" and "technology first," and the "crawling philosophy" and "slave philosophy to foreigners," have been deeply criticized. Our workers' thoughts have been further liberated, and new technologies and creations have continuously emerged. Our factory has developed 68 new products and new materials in the first half of the year, many of which are advanced products that have not been developed for a long time. We deeply feel that as Chairman Mao's latest instructions are increasingly grasped by the broad revolutionary masses and used to guide their struggles, our country will surely create miracles in science and technology that bourgeois mediocrities and right-wing conservatives cannot imagine.

    教育革命的战斗纲领　反修防修的百年大计
    ——上海工农兵代表人物座谈毛主席最新指示纪要
    伟大领袖毛主席最近深刻地指出：“大学还是要办的，我这里主要说的是理工科大学还要办，但学制要缩短，教育要革命，要无产阶级政治挂帅，走上海机床厂从工人中培养技术人员的道路。要从有实践经验的工人农民中间选拔学生，到学校学几年以后，又回到生产实践中去。”毛主席这一最新指示的发表，给“一月革命”风暴策源地上海的广大工农兵群众以极其巨大的鼓舞，他们越学越兴奋，越学心里越亮堂，越学革命精神越高昂。他们激动地说，毛主席的伟大号召，大长了我们工农兵的志气，大灭了资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的威风。毛主席的最新指示，宣告了资产阶级教育制度和中国赫鲁晓夫反革命修正主义教育路线的彻底破产，为广大工农兵群众培养自己的知识分子，开辟了最广阔的道路。他们欢呼：毛主席的最新指示是将无产阶级教育革命进行到底的战斗纲领，是反修防修的百年大计，是我们最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席对马克思列宁主义的新发展。毛主席最新指示的不可估量的意义，将随着革命实践的发展越来越充分地显示出来。
    上海的广大工农兵群众，怀着对伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱、无限忠诚的心情，目前正在广泛深入地学习毛主席的这一伟大指示。二十四日，本社记者邀请上海工农兵的一些代表人物，就毛主席这一最新指示进行了座谈。下面是座谈会发言的纪要。
    南京路上好八连，是在战无不胜的毛泽东思想哺育下成长起来的一个优秀连队。这个连队就是一所大学校。几年来，这个连队培养出了大批德才兼备的干部。这个连队的四排排长邵金城在座谈会上说：
    毛主席的最新指示
        是反修防修的百年大计
    毛主席的最新指示，我们热烈拥护，坚决照办。无产阶级文化大革命以前，在中国赫鲁晓夫反革命修正主义教育路线的统治下，在资产阶级知识分子的把持下，学校排斥工农兵，培养的学生脱离无产阶级政治，脱离工农群众，脱离生产实践，这样的学校是培养不出无产阶级革命事业的接班人来的，只能培养高踞于群众之上的“精神贵族”。无产阶级的教育事业，只有象毛主席所教导的那样，“彻底改变资产阶级知识分子统治我们学校的现象”，“走上海机床厂从工人中培养技术人员的道路”，“从有实践经验的工人农民中间选拔学生，到学校学几年以后，又回到生产实践中去”，才能培养出“有社会主义觉悟的有文化的劳动者”；也只有这样，才能防止修正主义，防止资本主义复辟。
    从工人中培养技术人员，从有实践经验的工人农民中间培养无产阶级革命事业的接班人，这是伟大领袖毛主席一贯的思想。毛主席亲自缔造和哺育的人民解放军，几十年来就是这样做的。在过去的战争年代里，我军涌现出了许多杰出的军事家和优秀的指挥员，他们在毛主席的英明领导下，带领部队打败了几百万国民党匪军。他们从来没有进过什么军事大学，有的原来是扛锄头的庄稼汉，有的是一字不识的放牛娃，根本不懂得打仗。他们就是“从战争学习战争”，在多年革命战争的实践中，学会了战争，成了党的优秀的军事干部。
    解放以后，我军在伟大统帅毛主席的领导下，也培养出了大量的优秀干部。回顾我们八连成长的过程，我们对毛主席的这一最新指示感到格外亲切。十多年来，我们八连就象学校一样，培养出了一批又一批干部。不算已到地方工作的，只是现在在部队工作的就有几十名。他们现在有的担任团的政治委员，有的是营教导员，有的是连队的指导员、连排长。他们忠于毛主席、忠于毛泽东思想、忠于毛主席的革命路线，又有丰富的实际工作经验，能够始终和战士打成一片，因而普遍受到了广大战士的欢迎。他们也没有进过什么学校，而是在毛泽东思想的哺育下，在各种实际斗争中不断地锻炼成长起来的。
    我们深深体会到，上海机床厂从工人中培养技术人员的道路，就是培养无产阶级革命事业接班人的道路。有了在实际斗争中产生的无产阶级革命事业的接班人，我们的社会主义铁打江山就会永不变色。我们一定要坚定不移地沿着毛主席所指引的这条道路奋勇前进。
    杨富珍是上海国棉一厂的工人。她曾经多次见过我们最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席。解放前，她是一个贫农家庭中的苦孩子，十四岁进工厂当童工，受尽了地主和资本家的残酷剥削。她怀着对毛主席、对共产党无比深厚的无产阶级感情，怀着对社会主义的无比热爱，在座谈会上激动地说：
    我们需要的是听毛主席的话，
      和工农相结合的知识分子
    我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席，总是在革命胜利进展的每个关键时刻，及时作出英明的指示，指引着我们前进。现在正是全国亿万革命人民阔步前进，夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的重要时刻，毛主席又及时发出了具有伟大历史意义的最新指示，为我们制定了将无产阶级教育革命进行到底的战斗纲领。我这个童工出身的工人，又一次体会到我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席是多么英明伟大！我要千遍万遍地高呼：毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！
    毛主席的最新指示，是彻底摧毁资产阶级教育制度的最锐利武器，是培养无产阶级革命事业接班人的指路明灯。按照毛主席的教导培养出来的知识分子，才是我们工人阶级的知识分子。他们听毛主席的话，愿意并且实行和工农结合，理论联系实际，不谋个人私利，全心全意为中国人民和世界人民服务。
    在毛泽东思想的哺育下，在毛主席革命路线的光辉照耀下，我们国家涌现出了许多革命的知识分子。我遇到过一些这样的人，他们努力按照毛主席的指示改造自己，深入到工人群众中，拜工人为师，和工人同学习、同劳动、同战斗，逐步摆脱了修正主义教育路线的影响，和工人心贴心。他们的技术知识和生产实践结合以后，在生产上也起了很多作用。在这次无产阶级文化大革命中，他们经受了大风大浪的考验。我们工人喜欢这样的知识分子。但是，在中国赫鲁晓夫修正主义教育路线的影响下，也有许多知识分子，一心想自己成名成家，不愿意和工农群众相结合，脱离实际，脱离劳动，脱离群众，还自以为了不起，看不起我们工人。譬如有的从学校出来的“教练员”，来到车间，夸夸其谈，但是不但不能“教练”，反而要工人把着手帮他开车。我还遇到过这样一个知识分子：她臭架子不小，脏的活不干，重的活不干，却对工人指手划脚。这些知识分子受修正主义毒害很深。我们希望他们按照毛主席的教导，放下架子，努力改造自己，迅速赶上亿万革命人民前进的雄伟步伐。
    上海郊区北桥公社灯塔大队，是上海市活学活用毛泽东思想先进单位。这几天，这个大队的贫下中农，怀着对伟大领袖毛主席的无比忠诚，举办了学习班，认真学习毛主席的最新指示。在座谈会上，这个大队的党支部书记陆顺龙说：
    在阶级斗争中培养
        贫下中农称心的人材
    毛主席的最新指示，真是说到我们贫下中农的心坎里。我们贫下中农对中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义教育路线，早就恨透了。这条修正主义教育路线，把我们的子弟引导到脱离无产阶级政治、脱离工农群众、脱离生产实践的邪路上去。我们灯塔大队前几年就有一些受到中国赫鲁晓夫修正主义教育路线毒害过的青年。他们出了校门，一不会做工，二不肯种田，安排他们劳动，嫌吃力，三天两头想到城市找工作。我们贫下中农对他们又气又疼。就拿一个高中毕业的学生来说，他一九六二年从学校回来，贫下中农认为他是队里文化最高的人，高高兴兴地选他当了会计。可是他认为自己回到队里工作是“吃亏”，虽然勉强当了会计，但捧了几本账簿弄不清楚怎样记账和算账。自己不会打算盘，又怕丢了面子，不肯向人家请教。月终结算，别的队没读过几年书的“小会计”，滴滴嗒嗒，算盘打得滚瓜烂熟，可是他还在一张一张稿纸上面画阿拉伯字。我们贫下中农称这种人是“理论一套，实际做不到”。修正主义的旧教育制度真害死人。
    毛主席早就教导我们：“无产阶级革命事业的接班人，是在群众斗争中产生的，是在革命大风大浪的锻炼中成长的。”无产阶级要培养自己的人材，就是要他们上好阶级斗争这一门主课，活学活用毛泽东思想，勇敢地投身到火热的阶级斗争中去，走和工农相结合的道路。我们大队在这次无产阶级文化大革命中掀起了活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动。毛泽东思想学习班不仅大队办，生产队办，贫下中农也家家户户办，毛泽东思想深入了人心。大家以毛泽东思想为武器，在田头、宅基、家里，到处摆下革命大批判的战场，把中国赫鲁晓夫的种种反革命修正主义谬论，一个一个拿来狠批狠驳。在这个大学习、大批判、大斗争中，全大队革命群众的阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟进一步提高了，一些受过修正主义教育路线毒害的青年也变了样，那个高中毕业生就好象换了一个人。贫下中农高兴地说，正如毛主席教导的那样，“阶级斗争，一抓就灵”，用毛泽东思想为武器，开展革命大批判，把受中国赫鲁晓夫修正主义毒害的青年，重新引到毛主席的革命道路上来了。
    最近几天，我们贫下中农在学习毛主席最新指示的时候，越学越开心。从我们大队一些知识青年的变化，我们具体地体会到，伟大领袖毛主席这一最新指示真正是使我们社会主义江山永不改变颜色的千年大计、万年大计。在毛主席这一个具有伟大历史意义的指示的指引下，我们一定能够打破旧的资产阶级的教育制度，无产阶级的崭新的教育制度一定会胜利地建立起来，培养出千千万万我们贫下中农称心满意的接班人来。
    蔡祖泉，是玻璃工人出身的电光源专家。陆阿狗，原来是上海国营第二纺织机械厂的工人，技术革新能手，全国劳动模范，以后他到上海农业科学院农业机械研究所从事研究工作。在多年的科学实践中，他们受到了党内一小撮走资派和资产阶级反动学术“权威”的疯狂迫害和打击。在这次文化大革命运动初期，陆阿狗还被打成了“反革命”。他们在座谈会上说：
    走上海机床厂的道路，
        是一场激烈的阶级斗争
    他们说，毛主席的最新指示，是进行无产阶级教育革命的战斗纲领，也为我国迅速发展科学技术事业开辟了宽广的道路。毛主席所指出的上海机床厂从工人中培养技术人员的道路，是同中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义教育路线、反革命修正主义科技路线完全对立的。走上海机床厂道路的过程，就是两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线激烈斗争的过程。
    陆阿狗说：解放前，中国的纺织机械都是从日本等帝国主义国家进口的。一九五二年，我们几个工人决心为中国工人阶级争气，自制中国的单皮圈大牵伸细纱机。当时厂里的走资派伙同一小撮资产阶级反动学术“权威”疯狂地对我们进行迫害。他们放空气攻击说，这是“扯蛋”，胡说什么“人家高级工程师研究了多少年也没有搞出来，你们工人文化水平低，又没有理论，完全是瞎搞”。我们要试验，他们不给经费，不给加工零件，不给材料。直到一九五四年，在工人的大力支持下，试制才基本上得到了成功。纺出来的高支纱，质量比同类型的日本制的细纱机纺出来的还要好。他们又耍了一个新阴谋，弄了一些厂外的“专家”、“权威”，到厂里“鉴定”，最后以机器需要“巩固”“提高”为名，把我们的研究成果打入了冷宫。
    一九六二年，我去江西工作，看到有的地方耕田还用人力。我就想，贫下中农是我们的阶级兄弟，我们有责任帮助他们减轻体力劳动。我根据中国农民牛犁的特点，设计了一种振动犁。当时我是国营二机的副厂长，我决心离开工厂到农科院农机所去进行研究试验。到了农机所，院、所的一小撮走资派对这项研究完全抱着怀疑、冷淡、抵制的态度。他们对我也是采取“三不主义”：不给工具、不给材料、不给工人，只允许在一个破烂不堪的仓库里试验。但这并没有难倒我。我和其他同志一起，冲破重重阻力，使试制工作取得了进展。党内一小撮走资派和资产阶级反动学术“权威”又散播种种流言蜚语，说我想“出名”，是“癞蛤蟆想吃天鹅肉”。到一九六六年文化大革命初期，党内一小撮走资派更怕我起来造他们的反，先发制人，把我打成了“反革命”。直到“一月革命”以后，我们夺了党内一小撮走资派的权，无产阶级革命派掌了权，振动犁的试验才取得了迅速的进展。现在两台正在作实地试验的大型振动犁，耕地效果很好，得到群众的欢迎和好评。回顾十多年来科研实践的过程，真是充满着同党内一小撮走资派、资产阶级反动学术“权威”的激烈斗争，每前进一步都是阻力重重。
    蔡祖泉、陆阿狗激动地谈到：毛主席的最新指示，象光芒四射的灯塔，照亮了我们前进的道路。但是，要贯彻执行毛主席的这一教导，必然还会有激烈的斗争。一小撮阶级敌人一定要进行疯狂抵抗，中国赫鲁晓夫修正主义路线的流毒以及旧的习惯势力，也必然会成为阻力。我们的体会是，一定要在斗争中落实毛主席的最新指示，在斗争中捍卫毛主席的最新指示，坚决走毛主席所指引的道路。
    最近，上海第三钢铁厂在平炉车间大修工程中，出现了一个起重史上罕见的奇迹：两座各高达五十五米，重达二百三十吨的平炉大烟囱，既不是拆下来重建，也不是放倒后再拉到新的基础上重新树好，而是分别垂直移动了三十一米和四十米。参加这项工程的老工人包宝兴、李松全等在座谈会上说：
    走上海机床厂的道路，
        才能发展新的科学技术
    他们说，象这样巨型的烟囱，采取“垂直移位”的方法，任何书本上都是找不到的。但这其实是正常的事情。毛主席早就教导我们：“认识从实践始”，“一切真知都是从直接经验发源的”。书本上的知识，只不过是前人已经进行过的实践的总结。如果死抱着书本，就不能有所发现，有所发明，有所创造，有所前进，就不能解决实践中提出的新问题。
    我们在这次平炉大修中间，在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，丢掉一切不适用的条条框框，破除迷信，不被“名人”、“权威”所吓倒。一面把一小撮反动的资产阶级技术“权威”和死不改悔的走资派揪到施工场地进行批判；一面进行深入、周密的调查研究工作，大胆设想，勇于实践，终于创造出这个移位方法，胜利完成了任务。整个移位工作，只用了一百五十个工时，两天不到的时间。如果按照以往的旧办法，就要花一千五百多个工时，五十多天。我们深深感受到毛泽东思想的无比威力。照毛泽东思想办事，就无往而不胜。
    我们最近一遍又一遍地学习了毛主席的最新指示，越学越感到毛主席的英明伟大。毛主席为我们制定了彻底摧毁资产阶级旧教育制度、建立无产阶级崭新的教育制度的战斗纲领。沿着毛主席指明的道路前进，不仅从根本上保证了我们的无产阶级革命政权永远牢牢掌握在无产阶级手里，而且将使我国的科学技术得到飞跃的发展。
    在这场文化大革命中，中国赫鲁晓夫鼓吹的“专家治厂”、“技术第一”等谬论和“爬行哲学”、“洋奴哲学”，受到了深刻的批判，我们工人的思想进一步得到了解放，新技术、新创造不断出现。我们厂上半年就搞成了六十八种新产品、新材料，其中有好多种是过去长时期没有搞出来的尖端产品。我们深深体会到，随着毛主席这一最新指示的不断为广大革命群众所掌握，用来指导自己的斗争，我们国家在科学技术上，也一定会创造出资产阶级庸人和右倾保守主义者所意想不到的奇迹。　（新华社上海二十五日电）
