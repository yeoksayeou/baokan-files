In March of this year, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, our medical department successfully removed a 90-jin tumor from the abdomen of female cadre Zhang Qiuju. This is a great victory for the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, a great victory for Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

Everything starts from the interests of the people, and we serve the broad masses of the people wholeheartedly.

In February, railway worker Cui Bingwu brought his sick wife Zhang Qiuju to our medical department in a small cart. As soon as Cui Bingwu saw us, he grabbed our hands as if seeing a family member, saying, "Soldiers, I've brought a dying patient to you!" At that time, we saw Zhang Qiuju kneeling in the cart, her two arms struggling to support her body. Her belly was so large that it was terrifying; her own hands couldn't reach her navel, and even breathing was difficult.

Seeing our class sister in such pain, we all felt a deep proletarian sentiment from the heart and immediately began to examine her. Her abdomen and half of her chest cavity were occupied by a large tumor. Although she was very thin, her weight reached 192 jin. We had never seen or heard of such a patient. What should we do now?

At this time, Cui Bingwu told us about their experience seeking medical treatment. He said, "In 1964, after discovering the tumor, we sent her to several large hospitals for treatment. However, she was diagnosed as 'incurable' by the 'expert doctors' and 'authorities' and was pushed out of the hospital. Thus, her condition worsened, and the tumor grew from the size of a bowl to the size of a large pot. She couldn't sit, stand, or lie down, and had to live kneeling on the bed day and night, completely losing the ability to take care of herself. Because of her, our family's hearts were almost broken. I know you are not a large hospital and do not have any 'experts' or 'authorities,' but I came to find the soldiers who are loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Please take her in!"

Cui Bingwu's account was a bloody indictment of the counter-revolutionary crimes of China's Khrushchev, which greatly educated us. We felt that what was before us was not just an ordinary medical problem but a severe struggle between the two lines.

Chairman Mao teaches us, "The question of for whom is a fundamental question, a question of principle." Now, whether to treat Zhang Qiuju's illness or not is such a fundamental question before us. Therefore, we decided to let the patient go back first, study the issue carefully, and then go to pick her up.

We reported this matter to the military unit's Party Committee. The Party Committee immediately gave clear instructions: "'Rescue the injured and save the dying' is Chairman Mao's teaching. Although your medical department's door is small, it must be opened wide for the poor and lower-middle peasants. This is a piece of work that has come to our doorstep, and we must not let the patient down. Whether to take in Zhang Qiuju or not is a question of loyalty to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. You must study this issue in a class, use Mao Zedong Thought to arm your minds, unify your thoughts. You must resolutely, with a heart of loyalty to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, treat Zhang Qiuju's illness well and give China's Khrushchev a heavy blow on the medical front in pushing his counter-revolutionary revisionist line!"

That night, we immediately convened a meeting of the Party branch committee to study Chairman Mao's instructions on medical work and discuss how to handle Zhang Qiuju's case. Some comrades said that how to treat Zhang Qiuju's illness is a question of whether our medical work serves whom. Comrade Che Liyi said, "I joined the army at the age of thirteen. In the war years, I was young and during the march, it was the poor people like Zhang Qiuju who pulled the donkeys to carry me, and it was the poor peasants like her who made shoes for us and carried stretchers to support us in winning one victory after another. Chairman Mao led us for decades in a bloody struggle, wasn't it to liberate the broad masses of the people and protect the broad masses of the people? China's Khrushchev and a handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists within the party do not care about the lives of the people, but we must!" At the committee meeting, everyone agreed that to defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, we should take in Zhang Qiuju.

With deep class feelings for the poor and lower-middle peasants, we sent an ambulance to pick up Zhang Qiuju to be hospitalized. When the ambulance arrived at her place, the whole village was in an uproar, and everyone spread the news: Chairman Mao sent the People's Liberation Army to pick up Zhang Qiuju for hospitalization! Neighbors, men and women, all came to Zhang Qiuju's house to visit her. Some combed her hair, and some helped her change her clothes. At this time, Zhang Qiuju was very happy and said, "Hearing that the People's Liberation Army came to pick me up for hospitalization, my heart feels like it has fallen into a honey pot!" The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants were all very excited and said, "Chairman Mao really cares about us poor and lower-middle peasants. Chairman Mao's revolutionary line is the line for us broad masses of the people!"

Through the process of admitting Zhang Qiuju to the hospital, we deeply felt that to serve the broad masses of the people wholeheartedly, having a simple class sentiment is not enough. We must use Mao Zedong Thought to further arm our minds, raise our simple class sentiment to the height of being infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and start from the interests of the people, serving the people wholeheartedly.

Use Mao Zedong Thought to arm our minds, raise the awareness of the struggle between the two lines.

Zhang Qiuju was a patient who had been sentenced to "death" by the bourgeois reactionary line in medical work for four years and had a very serious "despair" and "waiting to die" mentality. How could we make Zhang Qiuju confident in curing her own illness and become strong, cooperating with us in treatment?

After discussion, everyone agreed that Zhang Qiuju urgently needed to heal her spiritual wounds and increase her confidence in overcoming the disease. What could heal this wound was not some medicine, but the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. Therefore, we specially arranged for medical staff Li Weichao to study Chairman Mao's works with Zhang Qiuju, recall bitterness and sweetness together, criticize the bourgeoisie, and use Mao Zedong Thought to arm her mind. The brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought illuminated Zhang Qiuju's heart. She realized that it was China's Khrushchev's counter-revolutionary revisionist line that had made her like this. She also asked Xiao Li to hang a portrait of Chairman Mao by her bed, often saying to the portrait of Chairman Mao, "Chairman Mao, with your wise leadership, I am saved." Zhang Qiuju's class consciousness and awareness of the struggle between the two lines greatly improved. She not only had confidence in treatment and actively cooperated with the treatment but also established a revolutionary view of life and death. She told her husband, "If I die during the operation, you must ask the soldiers to take out the tumor and find a way to treat it, so that it won't harm us poor and lower-middle peasants again." Zhang Qiuju eliminated her fear of the operation. This was a very important condition for the smooth progress of the operation.

At that time, the problem before us was: what kind of tumor was Zhang Qiuju's, and could it be cured? Chairman Mao said, "Can't you solve that problem? Then you should investigate the current situation and history of that problem!" To understand this problem, we formed an investigation team to visit the hospitals that had treated and examined Zhang Qiuju's condition and related materials. Zhang Qiuju had been to several hospitals, undergone surgery, and had a pathological section examination, diagnosed as "retroperitoneal fibrosarcoma (low malignancy)."

The comrades of the investigation team reported the situation they had learned to the entire department, and some comrades began to discuss. Some said, "If they can't treat it, we must treat it, isn't this futile?" Others said, "To perform such a large operation, even in large hospitals, the mortality rate is 99%, and in our small medical department, it is 100% mortality." All these discussions reflected everyone's lack of confidence in curing Zhang Qiuju's illness.

The Party branch immediately held a meeting to study and believed that these discussions were not just ideological obstacles but the reflection of the long-term influence of the revisionist line that China's Khrushchev had pushed in medical work in our minds. Only by using Mao Zedong Thought to arm everyone's minds, thoroughly criticizing China's Khrushchev's long-term push of the counter-revolutionary revisionist line in medical work, raising the awareness of the struggle between the two lines, and eliminating the influence of the bourgeois reactionary line in our minds, could we, with an overwhelming heroic spirit, overcome various difficulties and cure Zhang Qiuju's illness.

The Party branch immediately opened a class to study Mao Zedong Thought. In the class to study Mao Zedong Thought, everyone used Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to expose and criticize the crimes of the bourgeois reactionary line that China's Khrushchev had pushed in medical work. We first refuted the saying of "incurable disease." Many comrades said that Chairman Mao teaches us, "Humanity must constantly summarize experience, make discoveries, inventions, and creations, and make progress. The theory of stagnation, pessimism, and doing nothing and being self-satisfied is wrong." The so-called "incurable disease" is not in line with Mao Zedong Thought. For some diseases that we cannot cure for the time being, it is not because there is no way to cure them, but because our understanding lags behind reality. One day, it will be possible to cure them. Chairman Mao also teaches us, "Save the dying and help the injured, practice revolutionary humanitarianism." Those who execute the bourgeois reactionary line, using "incurable disease" as an excuse, actually push the masses of the people out the door and do not care about them. We, the revolutionary fighters loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, have deep proletarian sentiments for the masses of the people. For us, there is no dying that cannot be saved and no injury that cannot be helped.

Then everyone discussed the issue of fighting for one percent or giving up one percent. Everyone said: Standing on the bourgeois reactionary line, from the bourgeois medical perspective, "self-interest" comes first, fearing to lose face, fearing to lose money, fearing to take risks, even if there is a 99% chance of success and only a 1% risk, he would not dare to take it. We are proletarian medical workers and should stand on Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, with "public interest" as the banner, not for fame or gain, serving the people wholeheartedly, even if there is a 100% risk, we dare to take it. For the 1% chance of curing Zhang Qiuju's illness, we only have the obligation to fight for it and no right to give up. The awareness of the struggle between the two lines increased, and courage also increased. Everyone thought that we should not blindly follow the previous diagnosis of Zhang Qiuju but should draw our own conclusions through our own practice. With the help of brother hospitals, we conducted a comprehensive and systematic examination of Zhang Qiuju's condition. Then, following Chairman Mao's instructions, we conducted a scientific analysis of more than thirty items of examination. Finally, we boldly negated the original conclusion and believed that Zhang Qiuju's tumor was benign, not malignant. The facts proved it to be so.

Firmly believe in the masses, rely closely on the masses.

Chairman Mao teaches us, "The people, and only the people, are the motive force in the creation of world history." "We have always advocated that the revolution should rely on the masses, everyone should take action, and oppose relying on a few people to issue orders."

The comrades of our medical department realized that curing Zhang Qiuju's illness was a major task to defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and everyone's enthusiasm and confidence were high. However, at this time, some doctors reflected, "Cutting the tumor still depends on a few people who can operate."

The question of relying on whom is not a question of method but a question of two worldviews and two lines. China's Khrushchev's counter-revolutionary revisionist line in medical work has always advocated that treating diseases depends on "technology" and follows the "expert" line. Chairman Mao's revolutionary line is to use politics to lead technology, firmly believe in the masses, and closely rely on the masses. Chairman Mao teaches us, "Among all things in the world, man is the most precious. Under the leadership of the Communist Party, as long as there are people, any miracle in the world can be created." People armed with Mao Zedong Thought are the bravest and most wise. Relying on a few people and following the "expert" line, or relying on the broad masses of the people and following the mass line, this not only relates to whether Zhang Qiuju's illness can be cured but also relates to which road our medical work will take.

In the class to study Mao Zedong Thought, we used Chairman Mao's instructions as a guide to lead everyone to fully discuss from the height of the struggle between the two lines. Comrades said: The skills of experts are limited, but the wisdom of the masses is limitless; diseases that experts cannot treat, the masses may be able to treat. We should follow the mass line politically and also follow the mass line technically. Chairman Mao said, "The masses have limitless creativity." We can only follow Chairman Mao's instructions, thoroughly eliminate the influence of the bourgeois reactionary line, fully mobilize people's enthusiasm, and cure Zhang Qiuju's illness.

Through learning and discussion, everyone became more clear that to firmly implement Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and serve the broad masses of the people wholeheartedly, we must firmly believe in and rely on the masses. After the rally to "Defend Chairman Mao's Revolutionary Line and Save the Dying," all the comrades in the department, from doctors and medical staff to cooks, animal keepers, and hospitalized wounded soldiers, all joined this battle, discussing everywhere how to cure Zhang Qiuju's illness. Everyone offered suggestions and measures, and finally, after summarizing, proposed "ten how-to's" and more than one hundred and twenty specific measures.

No matter how difficult, with the masses armed with Mao Zedong Thought, it is not difficult. For example, the problem of anesthesia, we did not have a professional anesthesiologist. Doctor Gao Jiazheng had only learned anesthesia for three months in the hospital. This time, we entrusted the task of anesthetizing Zhang Qiuju to the three-person anesthesia team led by him. They brought problems to repeatedly study the "Three Articles," repeatedly think about what problems might arise, and what measures should be prepared. To save the class sister, although they had prepared three sets of anesthesia machines and various measures, they were still not at ease, and before the operation, they prepared another "homemade anesthesia can." They said, "It is better to prepare ten thousand sets of measures and not use them than to miss the life of the class sister because of one problem not thought of." It was like this, thinking and thinking again, preparing and preparing again, the comrades of the anesthesia team finally formulated a relatively complete anesthesia plan.

How to make the "incision" to take out such a large tumor, so that the tumor can be completely removed and other tissues are less damaged, so that the patient can quickly recover health? To solve this problem, everyone offered suggestions and measures. Medical staff Feng Xueming did not sleep for three nights in a row, drawing eight "incision" diagrams and modifying them more than thirty times. Through the joint efforts of all the department personnel, finally, a relatively ideal "incision" plan was found.

Not only our medical department was like this, but the entire barracks, the broad cadres, soldiers, staff, and families also took action, everyone thought of ways, and everyone offered suggestions. The comrades of the barracks heard that we needed a semicircular table for the operation and rushed to make one overnight. The supply department heard that the original operation sheet was not suitable and rushed to make a new one. The families heard that many gauze bags were needed during the operation and took the initiative to sew them. In short, as long as we said we needed something, we would immediately receive enthusiastic support from all sides. In this way, under the joint efforts of the broad masses, a relatively complete operation plan and relatively sufficient material preparations were successfully completed.

Practice proved: once the masses are mobilized, many things we cannot think of, they thought of. Many things we cannot do, they did. To perform such a difficult and risky operation for Zhang Qiuju, from the material and technical conditions of our medical department, there were indeed great contradictions. In just over twenty days, we relatively completely solved this contradiction, made relatively sufficient material preparations, and laid a good foundation for the victory of the operation. This was completely the glorious victory of Chairman Mao's great mass line. The facts deeply educated us that to defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and serve the broad masses of the people wholeheartedly, we must firmly believe in the masses and closely rely on the masses.

Use Mao Zedong Thought to command the battle.

On the morning of March 23, a battle to defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and save the dying was about to begin. The military unit's Party Committee decided to send the deputy secretary and commander of the unit to the scene to command the battle with Mao Zedong Thought.

At 7:40, our political command, surgery, and eight other battle groups entered their respective battle positions. The patient Zhang Qiuju was also carried into the operating room. When leaving the ward, she and medical staff Xiao Li recited together several times the words of Chairman Mao, "With determination, fearing no sacrifice, overcoming all difficulties, and striving for victory." Because she firmly believed that the revolutionary fighters armed with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought would definitely do a good job in this operation, because she firmly believed that Chairman Mao's revolutionary line would definitely give her a second life, she had no fear and lay very calmly on the operating table.

The operation had not yet begun, and we encountered two unexpected situations. According to the original operation plan, Zhang Qiuju's two lateral great saphenous veins had to be cut open for blood transfusion and infusion, and at the same time, a vein had to be exposed for emergency rescue. However, everything that opened the blood vessels, the blood did not flow out, and when the needle was inserted, the blood did not flow in. At this time, the comrades of the political command group immediately recited Chairman Mao's instructions to everyone, "The mentality of relying on accidental convenience and hoping for easy victory without hard struggle and blood and sweat must be completely eliminated." Chairman Mao's words were like a bright lamp, instantly illuminating our hearts. We quickly found the reason why the blood did not flow in or out and boldly adopted another method to solve the problem of blood transfusion and infusion.

Then the anesthesia began, but within five minutes, a dangerous situation occurred. Zhang Qiuju had difficulty breathing, her blood pressure dropped, her heart rate increased, she sweated profusely, her face turned blue and purple, and she was about to stop breathing. At this critical moment, the deputy secretary of the Party Committee, holding the "Quotations from Chairman Mao," calmly said to everyone, following Chairman Mao's instructions, "We need a passionate and calm emotion, a tense and orderly work." Chairman Mao's words were indeed powerful, one sentence was worth ten thousand, and the comrades calmly checked and found the cause, and doctor Gao Jiazheng decisively switched to the "homemade anesthesia can," finally solving the problem and ensuring the smooth progress of the operation. Gao Jiazheng and the comrades who did the anesthesia were so thoughtful in the operation, which was because they had a red heart that was infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and loved the masses of the people!

However, as soon as the knife was opened, difficulties came again. The surface of the tumor was covered with a layer of membrane, and at this time, we did not know whether this layer of membrane was on the tumor or the peritoneum. If it was the peritoneum, it could not be broken, otherwise, the internal organs would be infected, affecting the long-term health of the class sister. Whether to operate inside the peritoneum or insist on operating outside the peritoneum, this was also a struggle between the two lines. According to the bourgeois and revisionist medical viewpoint, as long as the tumor could be taken out and the patient did not die during the operation, it would be considered a success. We not only wanted the class sister to be able to live healthily but also wanted her to be able to continue to work for socialism. Chairman Mao teaches us, "Our responsibility is to be responsible to the people. Every word, every action, every policy must be in the interests of the people." We decided to act according to Chairman Mao's words, be extremely responsible to the work, have extreme enthusiasm for the people, and strive for perfection in technology, implementing Chairman Mao's instructions in every small action. The comrades who did the operation operated very carefully and finally protected the peritoneal cavity, making the operation proceed smoothly outside the peritoneum.

How to take out this large tumor? We used Chairman Mao's military thought, "First, attack the dispersed and isolated enemy, then attack the concentrated and powerful enemy." "Surround the enemy on all sides and strive for annihilation." Everyone thought: if the tumor's surroundings were not first separated, the base would not be exposed.

In the process of separating the tumor, it was necessary to change Zhang Qiuju's original position, from lying on her side to lying on her back. However, turning over was indeed a very difficult and risky problem for Zhang Qiuju. According to Chairman Mao's instructions, since taking out the tumor was the main contradiction, we should think of a way to turn over and create conditions to solve the main contradiction. Therefore, we adopted a series of technical measures and then, with several people working together, helped Zhang Qiuju turn over successfully.

When the doctor began to separate the tumor, they found that the tumor's blood vessels were like a spider web. To avoid damaging other organs, the doctors did not use scissors or knives but used forceps to hold cotton balls, slowly separating them bit by bit, ligating them bit by bit, and trying to avoid massive bleeding. Although they separated so carefully, due to the large area of the tumor and the many blood vessels, bleeding was still considerable, and blood pressure dropped several times, and the heartbeat was abnormal. The originally prepared five thousand milliliters of blood were not enough. The comrades outside the operating room heard that the blood was not enough and rushed to donate blood. More than a hundred soldiers from the guard company, carrying the portrait of Chairman Mao and holding determination letters, beating drums and gongs, rushed to donate blood. A cadre named Jiang Balong had just returned from a mission, and as soon as he heard that his blood type was suitable, he lay down in the blood donation room. Other comrades advised him not to donate and to rest well, but he said, "This is to defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and save the life of the class sister, how can I not donate blood? If you don't draw my blood, I won't leave!" He insisted on donating two hundred milliliters of blood before leaving happily. The cook Zhang Beihua, as soon as he entered, lay down, and the doctor saw a needle mark on his arm, and it turned out that he had donated blood before. The doctor advised him not to donate again. Zhang Beihua said, "In the old society, my parents, because they could not live, sold me. It was Chairman Mao who liberated my family and made us reunite. Now Chairman Mao asks us to save the life of the class sister, how can I not donate blood? To defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, even if all my blood is drawn, I am willing." In this way, thirty-eight cadres and soldiers donated seven thousand five hundred and twenty milliliters of blood for Zhang Qiuju.

The operation had been going on for more than ten hours, and the medical staff had not had a drop of water or a grain of rice. Doctor He Siyi had suffered from gastric perforation in the past and still had severe gastric problems. He usually could not stand for two or three hours. This day, he took the initiative to carry the tumor. The tumor weighing several dozen jin pressed on his hands, motionless. His arms ached, and his stomach hurt, but he silently recited the words of Chairman Mao. It was the great power of Mao Zedong Thought that made him persist to the end.

Under the brilliant illumination of the great Mao Zedong Thought, after more than ten hours of hard struggle, the last blood vessel was cut off. The fighters who were infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line finally took out a ninety-jin tumor intact from the class sister Zhang Qiuju. At this time, everyone inside and outside the operating room was in an uproar, shouting a thousand times and ten thousand times: Long live the victory of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line! Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years, ten thousand times ten thousand years!

Zhang Qiuju woke up. She touched her stomach and was very excited, and the first words she said were, "Long live Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao saved me!" Mao Zedong Thought gave Zhang Qiuju limitless vitality. Although she underwent such a major operation, her body recovered quickly. The ninety-five-centimeter-long incision healed in one stage, and on the sixth day, she began to remove the stitches. On the eighth day, she was able to get out of bed and move around. Now Zhang Qiuju is very healthy and can do household chores and fieldwork, feed pigs, cut wheat, and clean the house, and can do anything.

The success of the operation for Zhang Qiuju was a great education for all the comrades in our department, further raising our awareness of the struggle between the two lines and making us more aware that in actual struggles, only by insisting on Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and firmly relying on the broad masses can we make discoveries, inventions, and creations, and make progress in struggles. In the future, we must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, better study and apply Mao Zedong Thought, resolutely implement and bravely defend Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, fully implement Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, and serve the broad masses of soldiers and the people wholeheartedly.

    毛泽东思想指挥我们战斗
    ——谈谈我们切除九十斤重大肿瘤的体会
    中国人民解放军驻保定某部卫生科党支部
      今年三月，我们卫生科在毛主席革命路线的光辉指引下，成功地从女社员张秋菊腹内摘除了一个九十斤重的大肿瘤。这是战无不胜的毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，是毛主席革命路线的伟大胜利。
      一切从人民的利益出发，全
  心全意为广大人民群众服务
    今年二月，铁路工人崔炳午用小车把他患病的爱人张秋菊送到我们卫生科。崔炳午一看到我们，就象见到亲人一样，紧紧拉着我们的手说：“解放军同志，我把一个等死的病人送到你们这里来了！”当时我们看到张秋菊跪在车上，两只胳膊吃力地支撑着身子。她的肚子大得吓人，自己的手摸不到自己的肚脐，连喘气都非常困难。
    看到阶级姐妹这样痛苦的病，我们都从内心发出了深厚的无产阶级感情，马上给她检查。她的腹部和半个胸腔被一个大瘤子占据了。她虽然很瘦，可是，她的体重竟达一百九十二斤。这样的病人，我们没有见过，也没有听说过。收下来怎么办呢？
    这时，崔炳午讲起了他们求医的经历。他说：“一九六四年，发现她长了瘤子以后，我们就送她到过几个大医院去治疗。但是被‘高明大夫’和‘专家’诊断为‘不治之症’，被推出了医院。这样，她的病情越来越重，瘤子就由起初碗口那么大一直长成现在象一口大锅这样大了。她坐不能坐，站不能站，躺不能躺，日日夜夜跪在炕上生活，完全失去了自己料理生活的能力。为了她，我们一家人的心差不多都被折磨碎了。我知道你们不是什么大医院，也没有什么‘专家’、‘权威’，我是来找忠于毛主席革命路线的解放军同志，你们把她收下吧！”
    崔炳午的诉说，就是对中国赫鲁晓夫反革命罪行的一番血淋淋的控诉，使我们受到了很大的教育。我们感到，摆在我们面前的不是一个普通的治病问题，而是一场严峻的两条路线斗争。
    毛主席教导我们：“为什么人的问题，是一个根本的问题，原则的问题。”现在，治不治张秋菊的病，就是摆在我们面前的这样一个根本的问题。于是，我们决定暂时让病人先回去，好好研究一下，再去接她。
    我们把这件事报告了部队党委。部队党委立即作了明确的指示：“‘救死扶伤’是毛主席的教导。你们卫生科的门户虽小，但是对贫下中农一定要开得大大的。这是送上门来的群众工作，决不能叫病人失望。收不收张秋菊，是忠不忠于毛主席革命路线的问题。你们要带着这个问题办学习班，用毛泽东思想武装头脑，统一思想。要坚决以对毛主席革命路线的赤胆忠心治好张秋菊的病，给中国赫鲁晓夫在医疗卫生战线上推行的反革命修正主义路线一个狠狠的打击！”
    当天晚上，我们立即召开了党支部委员会，学习毛主席有关卫生工作的指示，讨论如何处理张秋菊的问题。有的同志说，如何对待张秋菊的病，是关系到我们医疗卫生工作究竟为谁服务的问题。支委车利义同志说：“我十三岁就参加我们的军队。在战争年代，我年纪小，行军时，就是象张秋菊这样的穷苦人，拉着毛驴驮着我行军，就是象她这样的贫下中农，为我们做军鞋，抬担架，支援我们去夺取一个又一个的胜利。毛主席领导我们几十年浴血奋战，不就是为了解放广大人民群众，保护广大人民群众吗？中国赫鲁晓夫等党内一小撮反革命修正主义分子不管人民的死活，我们要管！”在支委会上，大家一致认为，为了捍卫毛主席革命路线，应该把张秋菊同志收下来。
    我们怀着对贫下中农无限深厚的阶级感情，派了救护车去接张秋菊来住院。当救护车一到她住的地方，全村都轰动了，大家奔走相告：毛主席派解放军来接张秋菊住院了！左邻右舍，男男女女都到张秋菊家里看望她。有的给她梳头，有的帮她换衣服。这时候张秋菊非常高兴，她说：“听到人民解放军开车来接我住院，我的心就象掉到蜜罐里一样！”广大的贫下中农都非常激动地说：“毛主席真关心咱们贫下中农，毛主席的革命路线就是为咱们广大人民群众的路线！”
    通过接收张秋菊住院的这段经过，我们深深体会到：要做到全心全意为广大人民群众服务，光有朴素的阶级感情还不够，必须用毛泽东思想来进一步武装我们的头脑，把朴素的阶级感情提到无限忠于毛主席革命路线的高度，才能一切从人民群众的利益出发，全心全意为人民服务。
      用毛泽东思想武装头脑，提
  高两条路线斗争觉悟
    张秋菊是一个被医疗卫生工作中的资产阶级反动路线判了“死刑”达四年之久的病人，“绝望”等死的情绪很严重。怎样使张秋菊对治好自己的病充满信心，坚强起来，配合我们治疗呢？
      经过讨论，大家一致认为，张秋菊当前急需的是治好她精神上的创伤，使她增强战胜疾病的信心。能治好这创伤的不是什么药物，而是威力无比的毛泽东思想。于是，我们就专门派卫生员李维超和张秋菊一起学习毛主席著作，一起忆苦思甜，一起批判资产阶级，用毛泽东思想武装她的头脑。毛泽东思想的光辉，照亮了张秋菊的心。她明白了，原来是中国赫鲁晓夫推行的反革命修正主义路线把她弄成这个样子。她还要小李把毛主席像挂在床头，经常对着毛主席像说：
  “毛主席呀毛主席，有了您老人家的英明领导，我就得救了。”张秋菊的阶级觉悟和两条路线斗争觉悟有了很大提高。她不仅对治病有了信心，积极配合治疗，而且树立起革命生死观，她对她爱人讲：“万一我在手术时死了，你也要解放军同志把瘤子取出来，找出治疗的办法，不能再叫它害咱贫下中农了。”张秋菊消除了对手术的恐惧心理。这对手术的顺利进行是一个很重要的条件。
    当时，摆在我们面前的问题是：张秋菊的瘤子是一个什么瘤子，到底能不能治好？毛主席说：“你对于那个问题不能解决么？那末，你就去调查那个问题的现状和它的历史吧！”为了搞清这个问题，我们成立了一个调查组，到曾经治过和检查过张秋菊病的医院了解张秋菊的治疗过程和病历等有关材料。张秋菊先后到过几个医院，动过手术，经过病理切片检查，诊断为“腹膜后纤维肉瘤（低度恶性）”。
    调查组的同志把了解的情况，向全科同志汇报了以后，一部分同志就议论开了。有的说：“人家不能治，我们非要治，这不是徒劳无益吗？”还有的说：“动这样大的手术，在大医院都是百分之九十九要死亡，在我们小小卫生科，那不是百分之百要死亡吗？”所有这些议论，都反映了大家对治好张秋菊的病缺乏信心。
    党支部马上开会研究。认为：这些议论不是一般的思想障碍，而是中国赫鲁晓夫在医疗卫生工作中长期推行的修正主义路线的流毒在我们头脑中的反映。只有用毛泽东思想武装大家的头脑，彻底地批判中国赫鲁晓夫在医疗卫生工作中长期推行的反革命修正主义路线，提高两条路线斗争觉悟，肃清头脑中资产阶级反动路线的流毒，才能以压倒一切的英雄气概，去克服各种困难，把张秋菊的病治好。
    党支部立即开办了毛泽东思想学习班。在毛泽东思想学习班里，大家以毛泽东思想为武器，大揭大批中国赫鲁晓夫在卫生工作上所推行的资产阶级反动路线的罪行。我们首先批驳了“不治之症”的说法。许多同志说，毛主席教导我们：“人类总得不断地总结经验，有所发现，有所发明，有所创造，有所前进。停止的论点，悲观的论点，无所作为和骄傲自满的论点，都是错误的。”所谓“不治之症”是不符合毛泽东思想的。有一些病我们暂时治不好，并不是因为这个病就没办法治，而是因为我们的认识还落后于实际，总有一天是可以治好的。毛主席还教导我们说：“救死扶伤，实行革命的人道主义。”那些执行资产阶级反动路线的所谓
  “权威”、“专家”，用什么“不治之症”作借口，其实是把人民群众推出门不管。我们忠于毛主席革命路线的革命战士，对人民群众怀着深厚的无产阶级感情，对我们来说，就没有不救之死，不扶之伤。
    接着大家又讨论了争取百分之一还是放弃百分之一的问题。大家说：站在资产阶级反动路线上，从资产阶级医疗观点出发，“私”字当头，怕丢名，怕丢利，怕担风险，就是有百分之九十九的希望，只有百分之一的风险，他也不敢承担。我们是无产阶级医务人员，应该站在毛主席革命路线上，公字挂帅，一不为名，二不为利，全心全意为人民服务，就是有百分之百的风险也敢承担。对于治好张秋菊同志这病的百分之一的希望，我们只有争取的义务，决没有放弃的权利。两条路线斗争觉悟提高了，勇气也就大了。大家认为，过去对张秋菊下的病历结论，我们不应该盲从，应该通过我们自己的实践，得出我们自己的结论。在兄弟医院的帮助下，我们对张秋菊的病情进行了全面的系统的检查。然后遵照毛主席教导，对三十多个项目的检查，进行了科学的分析。最后，我们大胆地否定了原来的结论，认为张秋菊的瘤子是良性的，不是恶性的。事实证明正是这样。
  坚定地相信群众，紧密地依靠群众
    毛主席教导我们：“人民，只有人民，才是创造世界历史的动力”。“我们历来主张革命要依靠人民群众，大家动手，反对只依靠少数人发号施令。”
    我们卫生科的同志认识到治好张秋菊的病，是捍卫毛主席革命路线的大事，大家热情很高，信心很足。但是，这时有的医生反映：“割瘤子还是要靠几个动刀的。”
    靠什么人的问题，不是方法问题，而是两种世界观、两条路线的问题。中国赫鲁晓夫在医疗卫生工作中推行的反革命修正主义路线，一贯鼓吹什么治病靠“技术”，走“专家”路线。毛主席的革命路线是要我们用政治统帅技术，坚定地相信群众，紧密地依靠群众。毛主席教导我们：“世间一切事物中，人是第一个可宝贵的。在共产党领导下，只要有了人，什么人间奇迹也可以造出来。”用毛泽东思想武装起来的人最勇敢，最有智慧。依靠少数人，走“专家路线”；还是依靠广大人民群众，走群众路线，这不仅关系到能不能治好张秋菊的病，也关系到我们医疗卫生工作走什么道路。
    在毛泽东思想学习班里，我们以毛主席的教导为指针，引导大家从两条路线斗争的高度充分开展讨论。同志们说：专家的技能是有限的，群众的智慧是无限的；专家不能治的病，群众不一定不能治。我们政治上要走群众路线，技术上同样要走群众路线。毛主席说：“人民群众有无限的创造力。”我们只有遵照毛主席的教导，彻底肃清资产阶级反动路线的流毒，把人的积极性充分调动起来，才能把张秋菊同志的病治好。
    通过学习讨论，大家更加明确了，要坚决执行毛主席革命路线，全心全意为广大人民群众服务，就必须坚定不移地相信和依靠群众。在“捍卫毛主席革命路线，救死扶伤”的誓师大会以后，全科同志从医生、卫生员到炊事员、饲养员、住院的伤病员，全部投入了这场战斗，到处都在讨论如何治好张秋菊的病。大家出主意，想办法，提出了许多建议和措施，最后综合起来，提出了“十个怎么办”和一百二十多条具体措施。
    千难万难，有了用毛泽东思想武装起来的群众就不难。比如麻醉问题，我们没有专门麻醉医生。医生高家政同志在医院里只学了三个月的麻醉。这次我们把给张秋菊做麻醉的任务交给了以他为主的三人麻醉小组。他们带着问题反复学习“老三篇”，反复思考可能出现那些问题，应该准备那些措施。为了抢救阶级姐妹，他们虽然已经准备了三套麻醉机，准备了各种各样的措施，但是还不放心，在手术前，他们又准备了个“土麻醉罐”。他们说：“宁可准备一万套措施用不上，也不要由于有一个问题没想到，耽误阶级姐妹的生命。”就是这样群策群力，想了又想，准备了又准备，麻醉组的同志终于制定出了一个比较完善的麻醉方案。
    摘取这样大的瘤子，用什么样的“切口”，才能既完整地拿出瘤子，又少损伤其他组织，使病人很快地恢复健康呢？为了解决这个问题，大家都出主意想办法。卫生员冯学明一连三个晚上没睡觉，先后画了八张“切口”图，改了三十多遍。在全科人员共同努力下，最后终于找出了一个比较理想的“切口”方案。
    不仅我们卫生科是这样，整个营房广大干部、战士、职工、家属也都积极行动起来了，人人想办法，个个出主意。营房科的同志听说我们做手术时需要一个半圆形的桌子，就连夜赶做了一个送来了。军需科听说原来的手术单不适用，马上赶做。家属们听说手术时要用许多纱布袋，就主动缝制。总之，只要我们说需要什么，立刻就会得到各方面的热情支援。就这样，在广大群众的共同努力下，一个比较完善的手术方案，比较充分的物质准备，都胜利地完成了。
    实践证明：群众一经发动起来了，我们很多想不到的事，他们都想到了。我们很多做不了的事，他们都做到了。给张秋菊做这样难度险度都很大的手术，从我们卫生科的物质条件、技术条件来说，确实存在着很大的矛盾。在短短的二十多天里，我们比较完善地解决了这个矛盾，做了比较充分的物质准备，为取得手术的胜利打下了很好的基础，这完全是毛主席伟大的群众路线的光辉胜利。事实深刻地教育了我们，要捍卫毛主席的革命路线，全心全意为广大人民群众服务，就要坚决相信群众，紧密依靠群众。
      用毛泽东思想指挥战斗
    三月二十三日早晨，一场捍卫毛主席革命路线救死扶伤的战斗就要开始了。部队党委决定派党委副书记、部队长亲临现场，用毛泽东思想指挥我们战斗。
    七点四十分钟，我们政治指挥、手术等八个战斗组，进入了各个战斗岗位。病人张秋菊也抬进了手术室。在离开病房的时候，她和卫生员小李一起同声背诵了几遍毛主席语录：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”由于她坚信战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装起来的革命战士，一定能做好这次手术，由于她坚信毛主席的革命路线一定能给她第二次生命，她毫无恐惧心理，非常安详地躺在手术台上。
    手术还没开始，我们就遇到了两个意外的情况。根据原来的手术方案，要把张秋菊的两侧大隐静脉切开，输血输液，同时要暴露一条动脉准备急救。但是，一切开血管，血管里的血不往外出，把针头插进去，血也不往里进。这时，政治指挥组的同志立即向同志们朗诵毛主席的教导：“一切不经过自己艰苦奋斗、流血流汗，而依靠意外便利、侥幸取胜的心理，必须扫除干净。”毛主席的话就象一盏明灯一样，一下把我们的心照得透亮。我们很快找到了血不出不进的原因，大胆采用另一种办法，解决了输血输液问题。
    接着开始麻醉，麻醉不到五分钟，就出现了险情。
  张秋菊呼吸困难，血压下降，心跳增快，脸冒虚汗，
  面色发青发紫，眼看就要停止呼吸。在这关键时刻，
  党委副书记拿着《毛主席语录》，很镇定地对大家说，
  遵照毛主席的教导：“我们需要的是热烈而镇定的情
  绪，紧张而有秩序的工作。”毛主席的话真是威力无
  穷，一句顶一万句，同志们镇静地仔细检查，找出原
  因，医生高家政果断地换上了“土麻醉罐”，终于解
  决了问题，保证了手术顺利进行。高家政和做麻醉
  的同志为手术能设想得这样周到，这是由于他们有
  一颗无限忠于毛主席革命路线，热爱人民群众的红
  心！
      可是，一开刀，困难又来了。瘤子表面上蒙着一
  层膜，这时我们搞不清这层膜是瘤子上的膜，还是腹
  膜？如果是腹膜，就不能弄破，否则会使内脏感染，
  影响阶级姐妹的长远健康。到底在腹膜内，还是坚持
  在腹膜外进行手术，这也是两条路线的斗争。按照资产
  阶级的、修正主义的医疗观点，只要能把瘤子拿出来，
  手术时不死，就算成功了。我们不仅要使阶级姐妹能
  够健康地活下去，而且还要使她能够继续为社会主义
  劳动。毛主席教导我们：“我们的责任，是向人民负责。
  每句话，每个行动，每项政策，都要适合人民的利益”。
  我们决心照毛主席的话办事，对工作极端负责，对人民
  极端的热忱，对技术精益求精，把毛主席的指示贯彻
  到每个细小动作上。做手术的同志，非常认真地进行操
  作，终于保护了腹膜腔，使手术在腹膜外顺利地进行。
      这个大瘤子到底怎样拿出来呢？我们运用了
  毛主席的军事思想，“先打分散和孤立之敌，后打集中
  和强大之敌。”“四面包围敌人，力求全歼”。大家认为：
  如果不把瘤体四周先剥离掉，基底部就暴露不出来。
      在剥离瘤体的过程中，需要改变张秋菊原来的体
  位，由侧卧改成仰卧。可是，翻一个身，对张秋菊来说，
  确实是一个又难又险的问题。根据毛主席的教导，取出
  瘤子既然是主要矛盾，就应该想办法翻身，创造解决
  主要矛盾的条件。于是，我们采取了一系列的技术措
  施，然后，几个人同心协力帮助张秋菊顺利地翻过了
  身。
      医生开始剥离瘤子时，发现这个瘤子的血管跟蜘蛛网一样。为了不致损伤其他的脏器，医生们不用剪子不用刀，用钳子夹着棉花球，慢慢地一点点地剥离，剥离一点，结扎一点，尽力避免大流血。尽管是这样小心剥离，由于瘤体面积太大，血管太多，流血还是相当多，血压几次下降，心跳不正常。原来准备的五千毫升的血不够了。手术室外面的同志一听说血不够了，争先恐后来献血。警卫连一百多个战士，抬着毛主席像，拿着决心书，敲锣打鼓，赶来要献血。有个干部叫姜巴龙，刚执行任务回来，一打听自己的血型正合适，就到采血室躺下了，别的同志劝他别输了，好好休息，他说：“这是为了捍卫毛主席的革命路线，抢救阶级姐妹，我怎么能不献血呢？你不抽我就不走！”硬是抽了他二百毫升的血，他才高高兴兴地走了。炊事班长周备华，一进来就躺下了，医生一看胳膊，有一个针眼，原来他已献过一次血了，劝他不要再献。周备华说：“在旧社会，我爹妈因为生活不下去了，把我卖了，是毛主席解放了我的一家人，使我们又团聚了。现在毛主席叫我们抢救阶级姐妹的生命，我怎么不输血呢？为了捍卫毛主席的革命路线，就是把我的血抽尽，我也心甘情愿。”就是这样，三十八名干部、战士，为张秋菊输了七千五百二十毫升的血。
    手术已进行了十几个小时了，医护人员滴水没喝，粒米没进。医生何思义同志，过去得过胃穿孔，现在还有严重的胃病，平时站两三个小时都难坚持。这天他主动担负搬瘤子。几十斤重的瘤子压着他的双手，一动不动。手臂酸了，胃痛了，他就默默地念毛主席语录。就是靠毛泽东思想的巨大威力，使他一直坚持到底。
    在伟大的毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，经过十几个小时的艰苦奋战，最后的一根血管被斩断了。无限忠于毛主席革命路线的战士，终于把一个重达九十斤的大瘤子，完整地从阶级姐妹张秋菊身上搬下来了。这时候，手术室内外，所有的人都沸腾起来了，千遍万遍地高呼：毛主席革命路线胜利万岁！毛主席万岁！万万岁！！
    张秋菊醒来了。她一摸肚子，非常激动，第一句话就喊：“毛主席万岁！毛主席救了我！”毛泽东思想给了张秋菊无限的生命力，作了这样大的手术，她身体却恢复得很快，长达九十五厘米的刀口，一期愈合，第六天开始拆线，第八天她就下地活动了。现在张秋菊已经很健康了，能从事家务劳动和田间劳动，喂猪，割麦子，打扫卫生，什么事都能干。
    为张秋菊做手术的成功，对我们科全体同志是个很大的教育，进一步提高了我们两条路线斗争觉悟，使我们更加认识到：在实际斗争中，只有坚持毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，坚决依靠广大群众，才能在斗争中，有所发现，有所发明，有所创造，有所前进。今后我们一定要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，更好地活学活用毛泽东思想，坚决贯彻和勇敢捍卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，全面落实毛主席一系列最新指示，全心全意为广大战士和广大人民群众服务。
