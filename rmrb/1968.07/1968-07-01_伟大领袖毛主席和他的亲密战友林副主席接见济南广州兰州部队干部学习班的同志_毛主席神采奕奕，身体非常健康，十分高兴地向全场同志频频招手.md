At a time when the entire nation's military and civilians are vigorously advancing towards the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and enthusiastically celebrating the 47th anniversary of the great, glorious, and correct Communist Party of China, the contemporary greatest Marxist-Leninist, our great teacher, and great leader Chairman Mao, along with his close comrade Vice Chairman Lin, received the revolutionary soldiers. This is the greatest care and encouragement for the entire nation's military and civilians.

The revolutionary soldiers who were received brought with them the portraits of Chairman Mao they had diligently embroidered day and night, filled with profound proletarian feelings of loyalty to Chairman Mao, loyalty to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyalty to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. They awaited the most glorious moment in the reception hall. They repeatedly read the teachings of the great leader:

"The core force leading our cause is the Communist Party of China. The theoretical foundation guiding our thoughts is Marxism-Leninism."

They read the teachings of Vice Chairman Lin:

"The ship of the great sea relies on the helmsman, and the revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought."

When the great helmsman Chairman Mao and his close comrade Vice Chairman Lin arrived at the reception hall, the entire scene erupted in joy. Chairman Mao was in high spirits and in excellent health.

"Long live the great, glorious, and correct Communist Party of China!"

"Wishing Chairman Mao eternal life! Eternal life!"

"Long live the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!"

"Long live the victory of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line!"
