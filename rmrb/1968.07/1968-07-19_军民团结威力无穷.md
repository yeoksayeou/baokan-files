The revolutionary modern Beijing opera *The White-Haired Girl* is filled with political passion and artistic charm, embodying Chairman Mao's brilliant thought of "the unity of soldiers and civilians is as one, see who can defeat us."

*The White-Haired Girl* passionately praises the New Fourth Army, which is armed with Mao Zedong Thought. During the period when the New Fourth Army's 18 wounded soldiers were recuperating in the village, they were not concerned about themselves but about the broad masses of the people. They labored with the people, helping them harvest rice. They thought about defeating Japanese imperialism as soon as possible to liberate the people. In the reeds, facing the difficulties of lack of medicine and food, they still encouraged each other and persisted in the struggle. When they heard the sound of enemy guns in Sha Jian Pang, they were worried that the villagers would suffer, and they wished they could immediately return to Sha Jian Pang to annihilate the enemy. They stood like pines on top of Mount Tai, fearing neither storms nor rain, and together with the people, they defeated the enemy and liberated the suffering masses.

*The White-Haired Girl* also passionately praises the deep class feelings of the broad masses of the people towards the soldiers. The people of Sha Jian Pang took meticulous care of the wounded soldiers, treating them as precious revolutionary assets. They risked their lives to scout for the New Fourth Army, delivering supplies, medicine, and intelligence, ensuring the victory of the battle.

Watching the play made us love the People's Liberation Army even more. In the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, it was the great People's Liberation Army that, following Chairman Mao's instruction to "support the broad masses of the leftists," supported the revolutionary masses of the proletariat. They overthrew the power of the handful of capitalist-roaders within the party, led by China's Khrushchev, and according to Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, achieved revolutionary great unity and the three-in-one combination.

In the "three supports and two militaries," the People's Liberation Army has always thought of what the people think and hurried to what the people need, firmly supporting and protecting the revolutionary enthusiasm of the broad masses of the people. They led the revolutionary masses to fight against a handful of traitors, spies, unrepentant capitalist-roaders in power, and untransformed landlords, rich farmers, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, greatly boosting the morale of the revolutionary masses and crushing the enemy's arrogance. It was the great People's Liberation Army that protected the revolutionary people, suppressed the enemy, strengthened the dictatorship of the proletariat, and ensured the victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

The great People's Liberation Army always listens to Chairman Mao. They patiently and meticulously do ideological work among the people. They stand on the party's side, with a protective attitude towards the people, and wholeheartedly help those who have made mistakes to return to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. This further raises the class struggle consciousness and line struggle consciousness of the broad masses.

Our great leader Chairman Mao personally founded and led, and Vice Chairman Lin personally commanded the People's Liberation Army, is a great army that never separates from the people. In the past, we relied on this army and the unity of soldiers and civilians to overthrow the three big mountains oppressing the people and established our proletarian red regime. At present, at the moment of seizing the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we must be especially vigilant against the evil plots of a handful of class enemies attempting to sow discord between the army and the people. We must firmly remember Chairman Mao's great teaching of "supporting the army and loving the people," carry forward the glorious tradition of the old revolutionary base areas, and love and support our People's Liberation Army.

The army loves the people, and the people support the army. The iron wall of our proletarian dictatorship—the People's Liberation Army—will forever be invincible!

    军民团结威力无穷

    革命现代京剧《沙家浜》以饱满的政治热情和强烈的艺术魅力，表现了毛主席“军民团结如一人，试看天下谁能敌”的人民战争的光辉思想。
    《沙家浜》满腔热情地歌颂了用毛泽东思想武装起来的新四军这支人民军队。新四军十八个伤病员驻村疗养期间，他们关心的不是自己，而是广大人民群众。他们和群众一起劳动，帮助群众收割稻谷。他们想的是早日打败日本帝国主义，使人民翻身得解放。在芦苇荡里，伤病员面对着缺药断粮的困难，他们仍然互相鼓舞，坚持斗争。当他们听到沙家浜响起了敌人的枪声时，担心村镇上乡亲们要遭祸殃，他们恨不得立刻杀回沙家浜去消灭敌人。他们始终象屹立在泰山顶上的青松，不畏狂风暴雨，和群众一起，战胜了敌人，使受苦难的群众得到解放。
    《沙家浜》还热情地歌颂了广大人民群众对子弟兵的深厚的阶级感情。沙家浜的群众无微不至地照顾伤病员，把他们看成是革命的宝贵财富。他们冒着生命危险，为新四军侦察敌情，送粮，送药，送情报，保证了战斗的胜利。
    看了戏，使我们更加热爱中国人民解放军。在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命运动中，是伟大的人民解放军，遵照毛主席“人民解放军应该支持左派广大群众”的教导，支持了无产阶级革命派，大造了以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的反，夺了他们的权，并且按照毛主席的伟大战略部署，实现了革命的大联合和革命的三结合。
    在“三支”“两军”中的人民解放军，从来就是想群众之所想，急群众之所急，坚定不移地支持和保护广大人民群众的革命热情。他们带领革命群众，向一小撮叛徒、特务、死不改悔的走资本主义道路的当权派和没有改造好的地、富、反、坏、右分子进行斗争，大长了革命群众的志气，大灭了敌人的威风。是伟大的中国人民解放军，保护了革命人民，镇压了敌人，加强了无产阶级专政，保证了无产阶级文化大革命胜利前进！
    伟大的人民解放军最听毛主席的话。他们耐心地艰苦细致地做群众的思想工作。他们站在党的立场上，用保护人民群众的态度，满腔热情地帮助那些犯了错误的人，回到毛主席的革命路线上来。使广大群众进一步提高了阶级斗争的觉悟和路线斗争的觉悟。
    我们伟大领袖毛主席亲自缔造和领导、林副主席亲自指挥的中国人民解放军，是一刻也不脱离人民群众的伟大军队。过去，我们依靠这支军队，依靠军民团结，推翻了压在人民头上的三座大山，建立了我们无产阶级的红色政权；当前，在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的时刻，我们要特别警惕一小撮阶级敌人妄图挑拨军民关系的罪恶阴谋。我们要牢牢记住毛主席“拥军爱民”的伟大教导，继承老根据地人民的光荣传统，热爱和拥护我们的人民解放军。
    军爱民，民拥军，我们无产阶级专政所依靠的钢铁长城——中国人民解放军永远无敌于天下！
