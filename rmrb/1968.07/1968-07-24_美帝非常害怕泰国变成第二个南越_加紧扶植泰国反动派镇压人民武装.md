The U.S. imperialists, under the guise of "aid," are hastening to bolster the Thai reactionaries in an attempt to extinguish the blazing flames of the Thai people's revolutionary armed struggle.

According to reports from Thai newspapers, the United States will hand over ten troop-transport helicopters to the Thanom Kittikachorn traitorous clique by the end of July to be used in suppressing the Thai people's armed forces. These helicopters were shipped to Thailand in early July and are currently being assembled by American technicians sent from South Vietnam. In addition, the United States, through the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, has handed over a batch of transport vehicles suitable for mountain operations to the Thanom clique.

According to reports, the U.S. "Aid Mission" in Thailand and the Thanom clique signed a so-called "special aid agreement" on June 28. According to the agreement, the United States will provide the Thanom clique with three million dollars to be used for suppressing the Thai people.

According to the Thanom clique's "National Economic Development Council," the U.S. "aid" for the 1969 fiscal year remains at five million dollars. Thailand will use this "aid" to purchase American materials and equipment, and the construction projects will be undertaken by American companies.

According to reports from Thai newspapers, due to the frequent proactive strikes by the people's armed forces, attacking enemy police stations and camps, and deeply engaging in arming the masses, organizing the masses, and propagating to the masses, the people's consciousness has greatly increased. The U.S.-Thai reactionary military's "encirclement and suppression" of the people's armed forces is becoming increasingly difficult. The Thanom clique's "National Economic Development Council" is planning to establish pseudo-concentration camps—"village development zones"—in various provinces of Thailand, attempting to use isolation, intimidation, and other despicable methods to sever the blood ties between the people's armed forces and the masses.

The Thanom traitorous clique, in its blind pursuit of the U.S. expansion of the Vietnam War and suppression of the Thai revolutionary people's armed forces, has caused Thailand's military expenditures to skyrocket. In the 1968-1969 fiscal year budget, the expenditures for the military and police alone account for one-quarter of the total budget.

The "Voice of the Thai People" radio station recently commented that the U.S.-Thanom clique's intensified savage suppression of the Thai people does not indicate their strength but rather exposes their weakness. The Thai people's armed forces are advancing with great strides. Although they will have to go through a difficult and tortuous road, under the correct leadership of the Communist Party of Thailand, the Thai people's armed forces will surely achieve final victory.

### 美帝非常害怕泰国变成第二个南越  加紧扶植泰国反动派镇压人民武装

    美帝非常害怕泰国变成第二个南越
    加紧扶植泰国反动派镇压人民武装
    新华社二十二日讯美帝国主义打着“援助”的招牌，正在加紧扶植泰国反动派，妄图扑灭泰国越烧越旺的人民革命武装斗争的烈火。
    据泰国报纸报道，美国将在七月底把十架运兵用的直升飞机移交给他侬卖国集团，用来镇压泰国人民武装。这些直升飞机已于七月初运进泰国，目前正由美帝从南越派去的技术人员加紧安装。此外，美国还通过东南亚条约组织，把一批适于山区行动的交通工具交给他侬集团。
    据报道，美国在泰国的“美援分署”和他侬集团六月二十八日还签署了一项所谓“特别援助协定”。按协定规定，美国将给他侬集团三百万美元，作为镇压泰国人民的费用。
    据他侬集团的“发展国家经济院”七月初宣布，美国一九六九年度给泰国的常年“援助”仍为五千万美元。泰国使用这笔“援款”时，将用美国的器材和材料，并由美国公司承担修建工程。
    据泰国报纸透露，由于人民武装频繁主动出击，袭击敌人的警署和营地，并深入进行武装群众、组织群众、宣传群众的工作，使人民觉悟大为提高，美泰反动军队“围剿”人民武装越来越困难。他侬集团的“发展国家经济院”正计划在泰国各府遍设变相集中营——“乡村建设区”，妄图用隔离、恐吓等卑鄙手段，割断人民武装同群众的血肉联系。
    他侬卖国集团死心塌地追随美国扩大侵越战争，镇压泰国革命人民武装，使泰国军费开支剧增。泰国一九六八——一九六九年度预算中，仅用于军队、警察方面的开支，就占预算总支出的四分之一。
      “泰国人民之声”电台最近发表评论指出，美国—他侬集团加紧疯狂镇压泰国人民，并不表明它们强大，而恰恰表现出它们的虚弱。泰国人民武装正在高歌猛进。尽管还要经历艰苦、曲折的道路，但是，在泰国共产党的正确领导下，泰国人民武装必将取得最后胜利。
