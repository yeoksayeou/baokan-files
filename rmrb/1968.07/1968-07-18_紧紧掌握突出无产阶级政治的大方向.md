The military representatives in the revolutionary committee of Lanzhou Railway Bureau use Mao Zedong Thought to guide the committee members to firmly grasp the direction of promoting proletarian politics.

The newly established revolutionary committee has further established the revolutionary authority of the proletariat in the stormy waves of class struggle. The spiritual outlook of the broad revolutionary staff has undergone tremendous changes, and production plans are overfulfilled every month.

Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, July 17th: The military representatives participating in the revolutionary three-in-one temporary power organ of Lanzhou Railway Bureau have carried forward the fine traditions of the People's Liberation Army, used Mao Zedong Thought to guide everything, and led the entire committee to focus on class struggle. In all work, they firmly grasp the direction of promoting proletarian politics, maintain close ties with the broad revolutionary masses, and have consolidated and developed the newly established revolutionary committee in the stormy waves of class struggle.

	Firmly Grasp Class Struggle Without Wavering

When the revolutionary committee of Lanzhou Railway Bureau was first established, the military representatives found that some committee members were busy setting up offices and determining personnel, neglecting class struggle; some committee members thought that after the establishment of the committee, they should focus on production. These complacent sentiments immediately drew the high attention of the military representatives. The military representatives first studied Chairman Mao's great teaching, "Never forget class struggle," and deeply understood that whether the committee's "leading group" focuses on class struggle is a major issue concerning whether the newly established committee can be consolidated. Based on their own heightened awareness, the military representatives, together with all members of the committee, repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions:

"The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is essentially a great political revolution carried out by the proletariat under the conditions of socialism to oppose the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes, a continuation of the long-term struggle between the Chinese Communist Party and its led broad revolutionary people and the Kuomintang reactionaries, and a continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie." They also, together with all members of the committee, went to the front lines of class struggle, seriously listened to the opinions of the masses, strengthened investigation and research, and discovered that a handful of class enemies were secretly creating counter-revolutionary public opinion, attempting to overthrow the newly established committee. The living class struggle reality educated the committee members, making them realize that no matter how busy they are, if they do not focus on class struggle, it is all in vain. Only by leading the broad revolutionary masses to act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, thoroughly rooting out a handful of class enemies, and smashing all the plots of the class enemies, can the newly established revolutionary power be fundamentally consolidated. Subsequently, the committee members went deep into the masses, mobilized the masses, and extensively launched remembrance of bitterness and sweetness activities. They also used the criminal acts of the class enemies they had uncovered as living teaching materials to educate the broad revolutionary staff, arousing the deep hatred of the revolutionary staff towards the class enemies. Thus, the entire bureau quickly launched a mass movement of exposing and criticizing a handful of class enemies. In the process of firmly grasping class struggle, the committee further established the revolutionary authority of the proletariat.

	Firmly Grasp the Direction of Promoting Proletarian Politics

From the day the revolutionary committee of Lanzhou Railway Bureau was established, the military representatives paid attention to bringing the principle of the People's Liberation Army of promoting proletarian politics into the committee. At the first full committee meeting held by the bureau committee, many committee members and masses raised many issues related to production, business, hygiene, and welfare, hoping to solve them at the meeting. There were many things to do, what should be done? The military representatives, in accordance with Vice Chairman Lin's instructions on "We must firmly walk the road of emphasizing politics," believed that it was necessary to firmly grasp the direction of promoting proletarian politics. During the meeting, they set aside specific matters, focused on discussing the issue of how railway enterprises should promote proletarian politics. The first document passed at this meeting was "The Decision of the Revolutionary Committee of Lanzhou Railway Bureau on Promoting the Great Mass Movement of Studying and Applying Mao Zedong Thought to a New Stage."

After the meeting, the entire bureau immediately launched a new high tide of the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. The military representatives of the Lanzhou Railway Bureau deeply felt that on the issue of whether to emphasize proletarian politics or business, it was not a matter of making a decision that could be solved. It was necessary to firmly grasp the revolutionary criticism, eliminate the poison of "business first" and "production first" spread by the Chinese Khrushchev, in order to ensure that proletarian politics were always emphasized in everything. The previous daily full bureau business handover meeting was always about setting targets, purely discussing production and talking about numbers. After the establishment of the committee, some people still advocated doing things according to the old rules. The military representatives believed that this was a major issue concerning what flag the committee would raise and what path it would take, and immediately introduced the experience of the army emphasizing proletarian politics and adhering to the four firsts to the committee. At the same time, they mobilized the masses to fiercely criticize the counter-revolutionary revisionist black goods of the Chinese Khrushchev. As a result, the situation of the handover meeting purely discussing business was changed, and Mao Zedong Thought and proletarian politics were used to guide the handover meeting. Now, the entire bureau has formed a trend of using Mao Zedong Thought to guide production and business, the spiritual outlook of the broad revolutionary staff has undergone tremendous changes, socialist labor discipline has been greatly strengthened, railway transportation has overfulfilled production plans every month, and the revolutionary and production situation of the entire bureau is getting better and better.

	Forever Maintain the Style of Close Ties with the Masses

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The reform of state organs, the most fundamental point, is to connect with the masses." The military representatives of the railway bureau committee believe that to make the newly established committee a revolutionary committee that connects with the masses, it is necessary to thoroughly reform the old organizations and old systems. As soon as the committee was established, the military representatives, together with all members of the committee, studied Chairman Mao's teachings on "streamlining administration," relied on the masses to break down the cumbersome and overlapping administrative organizations, greatly reduced the levels, and reduced the number of personnel. The leading members of the bureau committee all went deep into the railway lines and work areas, ate, lived, and worked with the masses, propagated Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and strengthened the direct connection between the committee and the masses.

After the establishment of the committee, there was a period when there were few criticisms from the masses. The military representatives believed that this was not a good phenomenon, and if it continued, it would be easy to become detached from the masses. Therefore, they inspired the committee members to timely seek the opinions of the masses and put themselves under the supervision of the masses. Once, the masses pointed out that the committee staff rarely participated in the criticism meetings and struggle meetings of the bureau. The military representatives believed that this criticism was correct and good! They immediately convened a meeting of the committee staff to study the criticisms of the masses. With the help of the military representatives, the committee staff was organized into classes and platoons according to military organization, often fighting face-to-face with the class enemies together with the masses. From then on, the revolutionary staff of the entire bureau loved the committee even more, often giving the committee criticisms and suggestions, and the committee members also became more conscious of listening to the criticisms of the masses. The broad revolutionary staff said, "Our committee is truly a combat command center that maintains close ties with the masses."

    兰州铁路局革委会军队代表用毛泽东思想引导革委会成员
    紧紧掌握突出无产阶级政治的大方向
    新生的革命委员会在阶级斗争的大风大浪中进一步树立了无产阶级的革命权威，广大革命职工的精神面貌发生巨大变化，月月超额完成生产计划
    新华社兰州十七日电 参加兰州铁路局革命三结合临时权力机构的军队代表，发扬人民解放军的优良传统，用毛泽东思想统帅一切，引导革委会全体成员狠抓阶级斗争，在各项工作中紧紧掌握突出无产阶级政治的大方向，同广大革命群众保持紧密的联系，使新生的革命委员会在阶级斗争的大风大浪中得到了巩固和发展。
      狠抓阶级斗争不转向
    兰州铁路局革命委员会刚成立的时候，军队代表发现有些委员忙于成立办事机构，确定工作人员，放松了阶级斗争；有的委员认为，革委会成立以后应该集中精力抓抓生产了。这些轻敌情绪立即引起了军队代表的高度重视。军队代表首先学习了毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的伟大教导，深刻认识到，革委会这“一班人”抓不抓阶级斗争，是关系到新生的革委会能不能巩固的大问题。军队代表在自己提高认识的基础上，便和革委会全体成员一道反复学习毛主席的最新指示：
  “无产阶级文化大革命，实质上是在社会主义条件下，无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命，是中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续，是无产阶级和资产阶级阶级斗争的继续。”并和革委会全体成员一起深入阶级斗争第一线，认真听取群众的意见，加强调查研究，发现一小撮阶级敌人在暗地里大造反革命舆论，妄图颠覆新生的革委会。活生生的阶级斗争现实，教育了革委会成员，使他们认识到，千忙万忙，不抓阶级斗争就是瞎忙。只有带领广大革命群众，按照毛主席的指示办事，彻底挖出一小撮阶级敌人，粉碎阶级敌人的一切阴谋活动，才能从根本上巩固新生的革命政权。接着，革委会成员便分头深入到群众中去，发动群众，广泛开展忆苦思甜活动，并用已掌握的阶级敌人的反革命罪行作为活教材，教育广大革命职工，激发革命职工对阶级敌人的刻骨仇恨。这样，全局很快掀起了一场群众性的对一小撮阶级敌人大揭发、大批判的高潮。在狠抓阶级斗争的过程中，革委会进一步树立了无产阶级的革命权威。紧紧掌握突出无产阶级政治大方向
      兰州铁路局革命委员会的军队代表从革委会成立的那天起，就注意把人民解放军突出无产阶级政治的原则带到革委会里。在局革委会召开的第一次全体委员会议上，许多委员和群众把有关生产、业务、卫生、福利等许多问题都提了出来，希望能在会上得到解决。事情千头万绪，怎么办？军队代表遵照林副主席关于“我们要坚定地走突出政治的道路”的指示，认为必须紧紧掌握突出无产阶级政治这个大方向。会议期间，他们摆脱了具体事务，集中精力讨论了铁路企业应该如何突出无产阶级政治的问题。这次会议通过的第一号文件就是《兰州铁路局革命委员会关于把活学活用毛泽东思想的伟大群众运动推向新阶段的决定》。
    会后，全局立即掀起了活学活用毛主席著作群众运动的新高潮。
    兰州铁路局革委会的军队代表深深体会到，在突出无产阶级政治还是突出业务的问题上，并不是作一个决定就可以解决的，必须狠抓革命大批判，肃清中国赫鲁晓夫的“业务第一”“生产第一”的流毒，才能保证时时、事事坚持突出无产阶级政治。过去一天一次的全局业务交班会，每次都是指标挂帅，单纯地谈生产、讲数字。革委会成立以后，有的人仍然主张按照旧章办事。军队代表认为这是关系到革委会举什么旗、走什么路的大问题，便及时把部队突出无产阶级政治，坚持四个第一的经验介绍给革委会，同时，发动群众狠批中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义黑货，结果，改变了交班会单纯谈业务的状况，用毛泽东思想，用无产阶级政治统帅了交班会，现在，全局用毛泽东思想统帅生产、统帅业务蔚然成风，广大革命职工的精神面貌发生了巨大变化，社会主义劳动纪律大大加强，铁路运输月月超额完成生产计划，全局革命、生产形势越来越好。
    永远保持密切联系群众的作风
    毛主席教导我们：“国家机关的改革，最根本的一条，就是联系群众。”铁路局革委会军队代表认为，要使新生的革委会成为革命化的联系群众的领导班子，必须彻底改革旧机构和旧的规章制度。革委会一成立，军队代表就和革委会全体成员一道学习毛主席关于“精兵简政”的教导，依靠群众打破了庞大、重叠的行政机构，大大减少了层次，减少了工作人员。局革委会的领导成员都纷纷深入铁路沿线，深入工区，和群众同吃、同住、同劳动，宣传毛主席的最新指示，加强了革委会与广大群众的直接联系。
    革委会成立后，有一段时间很少听到群众的批评意见。军队代表认为这并不是一种好现象，长此下去，就容易脱离群众。于是，便启发革委会成员要及时征求群众的意见，把自己置身于群众监督之中。一次，群众提出革委会工作人员很少参加局里的批判会、斗争会。军队代表认为这个意见提得对，提得好！马上召集革委会工作人员一起研究群众的批评意见。革委会的工作人员在军队代表的帮助下，按军事编制编成班、排，经常和群众一起向阶级敌人展开面对面的斗争。从此，全局革命职工更加爱护革委会，经常给革委会提出批评建议，革委会成员也都更加自觉地听取群众批评。广大革命职工说，我们的革委会真正是密切联系群众的战斗指挥部。
