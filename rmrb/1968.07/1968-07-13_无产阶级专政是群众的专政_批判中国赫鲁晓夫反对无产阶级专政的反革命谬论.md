The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: “Without extensive people’s democracy, the dictatorship of the proletariat cannot be consolidated, and the regime will be unstable. Without democracy, without mobilizing the masses, without the masses’ supervision, it is impossible to effectively exercise dictatorship over reactionaries and bad elements, nor is it possible to effectively reform them. They will continue to cause trouble and there will be the possibility of a restoration.” Chairman Mao’s great directive most profoundly and incisively expounds the relationship between proletarian democracy and the dictatorship of the proletariat, and ingeniously and creatively proposes the theory of the dictatorship of the people under the leadership of the proletarian party, greatly enriching and developing the Marxist-Leninist theory of the state.

The dictatorship of the proletariat must implement democracy for the people and dictatorship for the enemy

Chairman Mao teaches us: “In the historical stage of socialism, it is necessary to insist on the dictatorship of the proletariat, to carry the socialist revolution to the end, in order to prevent the restoration of capitalism, to carry out socialist construction, and to prepare the conditions for the transition to communism.” The historical experience of the dictatorship of the proletariat fully proves Chairman Mao’s wise judgment. The dictatorship of the proletariat and the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie are both the dictatorship of one class over another. However, the dictatorship of the proletariat is the revolutionary dictatorship of the proletariat and the broad masses of the people over the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes, it is the dictatorship of the majority over the minority. On the contrary, the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie is the counter-revolutionary dictatorship of the bourgeoisie over the proletariat and the broad masses of the people, it is the dictatorship of the minority over the majority. On this issue, Chairman Mao recently made the most profound summary. He said: “Whether to protect or suppress the broad masses of the people is the fundamental difference between the Communist Party and the Kuomintang, it is the fundamental difference between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, it is the fundamental difference between the dictatorship of the proletariat and the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie.”

The dictatorship of the proletariat and proletarian democracy are dialectically united. Within the people, democracy must be implemented; for the enemies of the people, dictatorship must be implemented. These two aspects are inseparable. Combining the two is the dictatorship of the proletariat. Only by implementing the broadest democracy within the people can the revolutionary enthusiasm of the masses be fully mobilized, placing a handful of class enemies under the direct supervision and control of the masses, implementing the most effective dictatorship. Only by implementing the most effective dictatorship over class enemies can the democratic rights of the proletariat and the people be better protected, fully mobilizing the great role of the masses in the cause of socialist revolution and socialist construction. The more intense the class struggle, the more the proletariat needs to rely on the broad masses of the people to defeat the counter-revolutionary forces. Relying on the broad masses of the people and strengthening the dictatorship of the proletariat are two sides of the same problem. Socialist democracy, in any sense, does not allow itself to be opposed to the dictatorship of the proletariat, nor does it allow itself to be confused with bourgeois democracy.

The Chinese Khrushchev, representing the interests of imperialism, the Kuomintang reactionaries, the bourgeoisie, and the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, frantically opposes the dictatorship of the proletariat. He rants about how the “spirit of democracy” is the “spirit of complete equality of mankind,” “it is that one person has no right to oppress or exploit another person.” He maliciously opposes democracy and dictatorship, confusing socialist democracy with bourgeois democracy.

Is the “spirit of democracy” the “spirit of complete equality of mankind”? In class society, there is only concrete democracy, class democracy, and never abstract, super-class “complete equality of mankind.” The so-called “complete equality of mankind” is a trick used by the bourgeoisie to deceive the working people, covering up the bloody rule of capitalism. As Lenin pointed out, bourgeois democracy is “narrow, incomplete, false, and deceptive democracy, a paradise for the rich, and a trap and deception for the exploited, for the poor.” Proletarian democracy, on the other hand, “will for the first time provide democracy for the people, democracy for the majority, while necessary suppression is exercised over the minority, i.e., the exploiters.” With bourgeois democracy, there is no proletarian democracy; with proletarian democracy, there is no bourgeois democracy. There has never been any “complete equality of mankind” democracy. The Chinese Khrushchev’s advocacy of the “spirit of democracy” is actually the promotion of bourgeois democracy.

“One person has no right to oppress or exploit another person”? This is all nonsense. The bourgeoisie cannot survive a day without oppressing and exploiting the proletariat and the working people. The proletariat must use violence to smash the state machine of the bourgeoisie and, relying on the power of the proletarian state, expropriate the means of production of the bourgeoisie, suppress the resistance of the bourgeoisie, and only then can the proletariat and the working people stand up. Mercy to the enemy is cruelty to the people. If you do not oppress the exploiting class, the exploiting class will oppress you. In a class society, there has always been “oppression.” The Chinese Khrushchev’s advocacy of “no oppression” is actually an attempt to abolish the dictatorship of the proletariat.

To blur the fundamental difference between proletarian democracy and bourgeois democracy is a common characteristic of all counter-revolutionary revisionists. The great traitor of the Second International, Kautsky, once raised the banner of “pure democracy” to cover up imperialism and conceal the festering sores of capitalism. The great traitor of the international communist movement, Khrushchev, once used the pretext of “all-people’s democracy” to cover up the rule of the new aristocracy in the Soviet Union, and in the first country in the world to implement the dictatorship of the proletariat, restored capitalism. The Chinese Khrushchev is no different from Kautsky and Khrushchev. He raises the banner of the “spirit of democracy,” acting as a lackey of imperialism, promoting bourgeois democracy, and beautifying the fascist rule of the monopolistic bourgeoisie. His goal is to obstruct the establishment of the dictatorship of the proletariat in our country, and after the establishment of the dictatorship of the proletariat, to turn the dictatorship of the proletariat into the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie. This is the greatest betrayal of the proletariat. We must smash the plots of the Chinese Khrushchev.

The masses are the source of the power of the dictatorship of the proletariat

The dictatorship of the proletariat is the dictatorship of the masses under the leadership of the Communist Party. Chairman Mao trusts the masses the most, cares for the masses the most, and supports the revolutionary movements of the masses the most. The dictatorship of the masses is Chairman Mao’s consistent thought. After the founding of the nation, Chairman Mao pointed out in the work of suppressing counter-revolutionaries that it is necessary to break through the closed-door policy and mysticism, and instructed all localities to organize public security committees. Since 1957, Chairman Mao has repeatedly pointed out that the work of suppressing counter-revolutionaries and public security must rely on the masses and fully mobilize the masses to follow the mass line. In 1962, Chairman Mao, in his speech at the Conference of 7,000 People, profoundly expounded the great significance of the dictatorship of the masses. In 1965, Chairman Mao, in “Some Problems Currently Raised in the Socialist Education Movement in the Countryside” (i.e., the “Twenty-three Articles”), again took “mobilizing the masses, seriously supervising, and locally reforming” class enemies as one of the standards for carrying out the socialist education movement well. In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, Chairman Mao again wisely pointed out: Dictatorship is the dictatorship of the masses. Chairman Mao’s brilliant thoughts greatly enrich and develop the Marxist-Leninist theory of the dictatorship of the proletariat. The Chinese Khrushchev, standing on the position of counter-revolutionary revisionism, openly opposes Chairman Mao’s brilliant thoughts on the dictatorship of the masses, ranting about how “counter-revolutionaries and criminals should not be allowed to be dealt with by the masses at will,” and vigorously promoting the closed-door policy and mysticism.

Under the leadership of the Communist Party, the broad masses of the people are the source of the power of the dictatorship of the proletariat. The dictatorship of the proletariat cannot rely solely on the public security organs without the direct participation of the broad revolutionary masses. The dictatorship of the proletariat can only rely on the working class, poor and lower-middle peasants, and the broad revolutionary masses to, under the leadership of the Party, consolidate the alliance between workers and peasants, effectively suppress the sabotage and disruption of domestic and foreign class enemies, defeat the attacks of the bourgeoisie, overcome the spontaneous forces of capitalism, consolidate and develop the socialist economy, and build our country into a great socialist country.

Since the founding of the nation, our great leader Chairman Mao has personally led the land reform, the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, the “Three Antis” and “Five Antis” campaigns, the anti-rightist struggle, and other great revolutionary mass movements, implementing the dictatorship of the masses and achieving one victory after another.

The historical experience of the dictatorship of the proletariat proves that after the proletariat seizes power, class struggle not only does not end but becomes more widespread, more acute, and more complex. The overthrown exploiting classes are unwilling to accept their defeat and use various means to engage in sabotage and disruption, especially by using corruption, infiltration, and splitting to find their agents within the Communist Party to achieve the goal of restoring capitalism. Chairman Mao tells us that the main targets of the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat are the representatives of the bourgeoisie who have infiltrated the organs of the dictatorship of the proletariat, the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. They are engaged in a life-and-death struggle with us to restore and counter-restore. We must overthrow them to consolidate and strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat and prevent the restoration of capitalism. Because they are counter-revolutionaries who use the red flag to oppose the red flag, the bourgeois headquarters hidden within the organs of the dictatorship of the proletariat, it is even more necessary to mobilize the masses and implement the dictatorship of the masses to dig them out from their deeply hidden corners.

The unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is the most extensive and profound revolutionary mass movement under the dictatorship of the proletariat. As Chairman Mao pointed out: “The masses have been fully mobilized. Never before have mass movements been mobilized so extensively and deeply.” Hundreds of millions of people, under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, created unprecedented socialist great democracy, greatly demonstrating the tremendous power of the dictatorship of the masses. The broad revolutionary masses, with the force of a thunderbolt, launched a sustained and fierce attack on the class enemies, destroying the bourgeois headquarters within our Party led by the Chinese Khrushchev, exposing the handful of capitalist-roaders, traitors, spies, and counter-revolutionaries within the Party, suppressing the sabotage and disruption of the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, and defeating the class enemies so that they fell into disarray. They smashed the evil plot of the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party led by the Chinese Khrushchev to restore capitalism, greatly consolidating and strengthening the dictatorship of the proletariat.

Implementing the dictatorship of the masses does not diminish the role of specialized judicial and public security organs, and throughout the entire historical period of socialism, our organs of dictatorship not only should not be weakened but should be strengthened. However, specialized organs can only effectively function by adhering to the policy of relying on the broad masses of the people and combining with specialized organs, firmly following the mass line. The Chinese Khrushchev vigorously opposes the dictatorship of the masses and advocates “relying solely on the judicial and public security organs.” His purpose is to attempt to control the “judicial and public security organs” under his bourgeois headquarters, turning them into counter-revolutionary tools to shelter and indulge class enemies and suppress the masses. This fully exposes his true face as the biggest capitalist-roader within the Party.

The Chinese Khrushchev’s basis for opposing the dictatorship of the masses is the “theory of the backwardness of the masses.” He shouts that the Chinese people “do not understand democracy.” This is a great slander against the Chinese people. During the period of the democratic revolution, under the wise leadership of our great leader Chairman Mao, the Chinese people fearlessly sacrificed themselves and fought bravely to overthrow the rule of the three great enemies and achieve the victory of the democratic revolution. During the period of the socialist revolution, the Chinese people, in various political movements, fully exercised their democratic rights and repeatedly consolidated and strengthened the dictatorship of the proletariat. In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the Chinese people directly grasped the form of great proletarian democracy—the big debates, big-character posters, big struggles, and big criticisms—and engaged in a life-and-death struggle with the handful of class enemies led by the Chinese Khrushchev, achieving decisive victories. All the facts fully prove that the Chinese people not only understand democracy the best but also understand the best how to exercise dictatorship over their own enemies. The Chinese Khrushchev’s slander that the Chinese people are “backward” and “do not understand democracy” is essentially a fear of the masses and an attempt to implement the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie over the masses. This fully proves that he has always been an agent of the bourgeoisie and the Kuomintang reactionaries.

Chairman Mao teaches us: “The most fundamental principle of reforming state organs is to link with the masses.” This is the fundamental guarantee for our proletarian dictatorship to fully function and never change color. The revolutionary committees composed of representatives of revolutionary masses, representatives of the People’s Liberation Army, and revolutionary leading cadres can maintain close contact with the masses, greatly develop socialist democracy, and to the greatest extent represent the interests of the proletariat and the working people, thus deeply rooting our regime in the masses.

The broad representativeness of the revolutionary committees, especially the direct participation of representatives of the revolutionary masses, ensures that the revolutionary committees become a new form of effectively implementing the dictatorship of the masses. The state power and the broad masses of the people are more closely linked, which is conducive to mobilizing hundreds of millions of revolutionary people to care about and consolidate the cause of the dictatorship of the proletariat, actively participate in the dictatorship over class enemies, and make the class enemies unable to escape the net of the revolutionary people. This strengthens our dictatorship of the proletariat and makes our country forever maintain its red color.

    无产阶级专政是群众的专政
    ——批判中国赫鲁晓夫反对无产阶级专政的反革命谬论
    中国人民解放军政治学院无产阶级革命派
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“没有广泛的人民民主，无产阶级专政不能巩固，政权会不稳。没有民主，没有把群众发动起来，没有群众的监督，就不可能对反动分子和坏分子实行有效的专政，也不可能对他们进行有效的改造，他们就会继续捣乱，还有复辟的可能。”毛主席这一伟大的指示，最深刻、最精辟地阐明了无产阶级民主和无产阶级专政的关系，天才地创造性地提出了无产阶级政党领导下的人民群众专政的理论，大大地丰富和发展了马克思列宁主义的国家学说。
        无产阶级专政必须对人民实行民
    主，对敌人实行专政
    毛主席教导我们：“在社会主义这个历史阶段中，必须坚持无产阶级专政，把社会主义革命进行到底，才能防止资本主义复辟，进行社会主义建设，为过渡到共产主义准备条件。”无产阶级专政的历史经验充分证明了毛主席的这一英明论断。无产阶级专政和资产阶级专政，都是一个阶级对另一个阶级的专政。但是，无产阶级专政是无产阶级和广大人民群众对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的革命专政，是绝大多数人对极少数人的专政。相反地，资产阶级专政，是资产阶级对无产阶级和广大人民群众的反革命专政，是极少数人对绝大多数人的专政。对于这个问题，毛主席最近作出了最精辟的概括。他说：“对广大人民群众是保护还是镇压，是共产党同国民党的根本区别，是无产阶级同资产阶级的根本区别，是无产阶级专政同资产阶级专政的根本区别。”
    无产阶级专政和无产阶级民主是对立的统一。在人民内部实行民主，对人民的敌人实行专政，这两方面是分不开的，把两个方面结合起来，就是无产阶级专政。只有在人民内部实行最广泛的民主，才能充分调动人民群众的革命积极性，使一小撮阶级敌人置于人民群众直接的监督和管制之下，实行最有效的专政。只有对阶级敌人实行最有效的专政，才能更好地保护无产阶级和人民群众的民主权利，充分发挥人民群众在社会主义革命和社会主义建设事业中的伟大作用。阶级斗争愈是激烈，无产阶级愈是需要依靠广大的人民群众去战胜反革命力量。依靠广大人民群众，加强无产阶级专政，这是同一个问题的两个侧面。社会主义民主在任何意义上都不允许同无产阶级专政对立起来，都不允许同资产阶级民主混淆起来。
    中国赫鲁晓夫，代表帝国主义、国民党反动派、资产阶级和地、富、反、坏、右的利益，疯狂地反对无产阶级专政。他胡说什么“民主精神”就是“人类完全平等精神”，“就是一个人没有权利压迫或剥削另一个人”。他别有用心地把民主和专政对立起来，把社会主义民主和资产阶级民主混淆起来。
      “民主精神”就是“人类完全平等精神”吗？在阶级社会里，只有具体的民主，阶级的民主，而决没有抽象的、超阶级的“人类完全平等精神”。所谓“人类完全平等精神”是资产阶级用以欺骗劳动人民，掩盖资本主义血腥统治所耍弄的鬼把戏。正如列宁所指出的，资产阶级民主“是狭隘的、残缺不全的、虚伪的、骗人的民主，对富人是天堂，对被剥削者、对穷人是陷阱和骗局。”而无产阶级民主，则“将第一次提供人民享受的、大多数人享受的民主，同时对少数人即剥削者实行必要的镇压。”有了资产阶级的民主，就没有无产阶级的民主；有了无产阶级的民主，就没有资产阶级的民主。从来没有什么“人类完全平等”的“民主”。中国赫鲁晓夫鼓吹什么“民主精神”，实际上就是宣扬资产阶级民主。
      “一个人没有权利压迫或剥削另一个人”吗？这完全是骗人的鬼话。资产阶级如果不压迫和剥削无产阶级和劳动人民，他们一天也活不下去。无产阶级必须用暴力摧毁资产阶级的国家机器，并依靠无产阶级政权的力量剥夺资产阶级的生产资料，镇压资产阶级的反抗，无产阶级和劳动人民才能翻身。对敌人的仁慈就是对人民的残忍。你不压迫剥削阶级，剥削阶级就要压迫你。在有阶级的社会中，从来就是有“压迫”的。中国赫鲁晓夫鼓吹什么“没有压迫”，实际上就是妄图取消无产阶级专政。
    抹杀无产阶级的民主和资产阶级民主的根本区别，是一切反革命修正主义分子的一个共同特点。第二国际的大工贼考茨基曾经扯起“纯粹民主”的破旗，用来粉饰帝国主义，掩盖资本主义的脓疮。国际共产主义运动的大叛徒赫鲁晓夫，曾经打着“全民民主”的幌子，用以掩盖苏联新贵族的统治，在世界上第一个实行无产阶级专政的国家里，复辟了资本主义。中国赫鲁晓夫同考茨基、赫鲁晓夫完全是一丘之貉。他打着“民主精神”的破旗，充当帝国主义的奴仆，宣扬资产阶级的民主，美化垄断资产阶级的法西斯统治。他的目的就是妄图阻挠我国建立无产阶级专政，而在无产阶级专政建立以后，又力图变无产阶级专政为资产阶级专政，这是对无产阶级的最大背叛。我们必须粉碎中国赫鲁晓夫的阴谋。
    人民群众是无产阶级专政力量的源泉
    无产阶级专政，就是共产党领导下的人民群众专政。毛主席最相信群众，最关心群众，最支持群众的革命运动。群众专政是伟大领袖毛主席的一贯思想。建国以后，毛主席就指出在镇反工作中，要打破关门主义和神秘主义，指示全国各地普遍地组织群众的治安保卫委员会。一九五七年以来，毛主席又一再指出肃反工作和公安工作必须依靠群众，充分发动群众，走群众路线。一九六二年，毛主席在七千人大会上的讲话中深刻地阐述了群众专政的伟大意义。一九六五年，毛主席在《农村社会主义教育运动中目前提出的一些问题》（即“二十三条”）中，又把对阶级敌人是否做到“发动群众，认真监督，就地改造”作为搞好社会主义教育运动的标准之一。在无产阶级文化大革命中，毛主席又英明地指出：专政是群众的专政。毛主席的这些光辉思想，极大地丰富和发展了马克思列宁主义的无产阶级专政学说。中国赫鲁晓夫站在反革命修正主义的立场，公然反对毛主席的群众专政的光辉思想，胡说什么“反革命、刑事犯不要让群众自己随便去搞”，“只能依靠政法机构去管”，竭力鼓吹关门主义和神秘主义。
    在共产党领导下的广大人民群众是无产阶级专政力量的源泉。无产阶级专政没有广大革命人民群众直接参加，只靠公安机关是不行的。无产阶级专政只有依靠工人阶级、贫下中农和广大革命群众，才能在党的领导下，巩固工农联盟，有效地镇压国内外阶级敌人的破坏和捣乱，战胜资产阶级的进攻，克服资本主义自发势力，巩固和发展社会主义经济，把我国建设成为一个伟大的社会主义国家。
    建国以来，我们伟大领袖毛主席亲自领导的土地改革、镇压反革命、三反五反、反右派斗争等，都是轰轰烈烈的革命群众运动，实行了群众专政，取得了一个又一个的胜利。
    无产阶级专政的历史经验证明，无产阶级取得政权以后，阶级斗争不仅没有终止，而且变得更加广泛、更加尖锐复杂。被推翻的剥削阶级不甘心自己的失败，他们用各种方式从事破坏和捣乱，特别是千方百计用腐蚀侵袭，分化瓦解，拉出去，打进来的办法，从共产党内寻找自己的代理人，以达到复辟资本主义的目的。毛主席告诉我们，无产阶级专政条件下革命的主要对象是混入无产阶级专政机构内部的资产阶级代表人物，是党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派。他们同我们的斗争是复辟反复辟的你死我活的斗争。必须打倒他们，才能巩固和强化无产阶级专政，防止资本主义复辟。由于他们是打着“红旗”反红旗的反革命两面派，是暗藏在无产阶级专政机构内部的资产阶级司令部，要把他们从深深埋藏着的角落里挖出来，就更有必要放手发动群众，实行群众专政。
    史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命，就是无产阶级专政条件下最广泛、最深刻的革命群众运动，正如毛主席所指出：“人民群众充分发动起来了。从来的群众运动都没有象这次发动得这么广泛，这么深入。”亿万人民群众在毛泽东思想的指引下，创造了前所未有的社会主义大民主，大大发挥了人民群众专政的巨大威力。广大革命群众以雷霆万钧之力，向阶级敌人发动了持续的猛烈的进攻，摧毁了长期隐藏在我们党内的以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部，揪出了党内一小撮走资派、叛徒、特务和反革命分子，镇压了地、富、反、坏、右的破坏和捣乱，把阶级敌人打得落花流水，人仰马翻。粉碎了以中国赫鲁晓夫为代表的党内一小撮走资派复辟资本主义的罪恶阴谋，大大地巩固和加强了无产阶级专政。
    实行群众专政并不贬低专门的政法机关的作用，而且在整个社会主义历史时期中，我们的专政机关不仅不能削弱，还应当加强。但是，专门机关只有实行依靠广大人民群众和专门机关相结合的方针，坚定地走群众路线，才能发挥有效的作用。中国赫鲁晓夫竭力反对群众专政，鼓吹“只能依靠政法机构”，其目的是妄图把“政法机构”控制在他的资产阶级司令部之下，变成他们包庇和纵容阶级敌人，镇压人民群众的反革命工具。这就完全暴露了他是党内最大的走资派的真面目。
    中国赫鲁晓夫反对群众专政的“根据”就是“群众落后”论。他大喊大叫中国人民“不懂民主”。这是对中国人民莫大的污蔑。在民主革命时期，我国人民在伟大领袖毛主席的英明领导下，不怕牺牲、前赴后继，为推翻三大敌人的统治，争取民主革命的胜利而奋斗。在社会主义革命时期，我国人民在历次政治运动中，充分地运用了自己的民主权利，不断地巩固和加强了无产阶级专政。在无产阶级文化大革命中，我国人民直接掌握了无产阶级大民主的形式——大鸣、大放、大字报、大辩论、大批判，同以中国赫鲁晓夫为代表的一小撮阶级敌人进行了殊死的战斗，已经取得了决定性的胜利。所有事实充分表明，中国人民既最懂得民主，也最懂得对自己的敌人实行专政。中国赫鲁晓夫污蔑中国人民“落后”，“不懂民主”，其实质就是害怕人民群众，妄图对人民群众实行资产阶级专政。这充分证明了他从来就是资产阶级、国民党反动派的代理人。
              *　*　*
    毛主席教导我们：“国家机关的改革，最根本的一条，就是联系群众。”这是我们无产阶级政权充分发挥效能和永不变色的根本保证。由革命群众的代表、人民解放军的代表和革命领导干部参加的“三结合”的革命委员会，能够保持和群众的紧密联系，极大地发展了社会主义民主，最大限度地代表了无产阶级和劳动人民的利益，从而使我们的政权深深地扎根于群众之中。
    革命委员会的广泛的代表性，特别是革命群众代表的直接参加，保证革命委员会成为有效地实现群众专政的崭新形式。国家政权和广大人民群众更加紧密地联系在一起，从而有利于调动亿万革命人民群众关心巩固无产阶级专政的事业，积极参加对阶级敌人的专政，使敌人无法逃脱革命人民群众的天罗地网。这就强化了我们的无产阶级专政，使我们的国家永远保持鲜红的颜色。
