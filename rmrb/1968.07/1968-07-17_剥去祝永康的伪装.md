	The poisonous weed "Storm and Thunder" features a "hero from the heavens" named Zhu Yongkang. The author wields his black pen, desperately praising Zhu Yongkang, claiming how he brought 300,000 jin of grain during times of food scarcity and difficulty in obtaining fuel, stabilizing the masses' emotions; how he, in times of economic hardship and disunity, organized everyone to weave mats, successfully overcoming the disaster. In short, Zhu Yongkang seems to be a "hero" who cares about the people's hardships and actively guides everyone onto the socialist path.

	"Falsehoods are false, and disguises must be stripped away." Using Mao Zedong Thought as a mirror, it is not difficult to see: originally, Zhu Yongkang is a trumpeter for China's Khrushchev, peddling the black goods of Khrushchev's revisionism.

	When natural disasters strike and the people's lives become difficult, caring for the people's hardships is correct. However, how did Zhu Yongkang "care for the people's hardships"? He did not speak of Mao Zedong Thought, did not speak of striving forward and self-reliance, but used the 300,000 jin of grain as capital, as if having grain meant having everything: the reactionary rich farmer Huang Longfei and his gang dared not cause trouble, the deceived masses who demanded grain were "ashamed," and everyone's enthusiasm for production increased. Is this caring for the people's hardships? Absolutely not! Zhu Yongkang wanted to use the 300,000 jin of grain to buy hearts, dressing himself up as a "living Buddha" who saves the suffering; Zhu Yongkang wanted to use the 300,000 jin of grain to deceive the masses, making everyone focus their eyes on the state-supplied grain, dispersing the masses' revolutionary spirit, and corrupting the masses' revolutionary will.

	To escape poverty and overcome disasters, organizing everyone to take the path of mutual aid and cooperation is correct. However, what kind of "mutual aid group" did Zhu Yongkang establish? This "mutual aid group" was established to do a "business with thin capital and thick profits"; this "mutual aid group" operated with the principle of "each doing their own thing"; this "mutual aid group" operated and distributed with the principle of "self-profiting and self-losing," "the more you weave, the more money you make." "Storm and Thunder" says that Zhu Yongkang's mat-weaving "mutual aid group" is socialist, while Zhu Xikun's proposal to engage in sideline production and hunt rabbits in the lake is capitalist. In fact, Zhu Xikun and Zhu Yongkang are two signs, the same goods, neither of them is engaged in the "right cause" of socialism, but rather the restoration of capitalism!

	The tricks Zhu Yongkang played in "Storm and Thunder" are very familiar to the poor and lower-middle peasants of Taoyuan. This is not some new thing, but the old junk of revisionism that China's Khrushchev's wife Wang ×× peddled in our Taoyuan.

	Isn't China's Khrushchev vigorously advocating material incentives? Zhu Yongkang in "Storm and Thunder," with 300,000 jin of grain, swaggered into Huangni Township; China's Khrushchev's wife Wang ×× also came to our Taoyuan with pockets full of money. To resist Chairman Mao's great directive of "Learning from Dazhai in Agriculture," to make "Taoyuan" surpass Dazhai, China's Khrushchev and his wife Wang ×× here vigorously promoted material incentives and spread the counter-revolutionary wind of economism. They generously spent the state's money, allocating a large amount of state funds to build a water lifting station in Taoyuan, open irrigation canals, and lay power lines to Taoyuan. They used their power to force the province, special district, and county to "meet needs, supply on time, prioritize Taoyuan" in material supply. Just take fertilizers, for example, they "prioritized" Taoyuan Brigade with 153,000 jin. Neighboring brigade members reflected: "Taoyuan applies fertilizers by the handful, we apply fertilizers by pinching." China's Khrushchev and his wife's move is truly poisonous. They spend the state's money to build this and that, just to "modify" the good tradition of self-reliance of the poor and lower-middle peasants of Taoyuan; they spend the state's money to give this and that, just to win hearts, steal fame, and create public opinion for their usurpation of the party and the country.

	Isn't China's Khrushchev vigorously advocating "three autonomies and one contract"? Zhu Yongkang in "Storm and Thunder" immediately hung the sign of "mutual aid and cooperation," engaging in disguised individual farming; Wang ×× in Taoyuan also desperately peddled the black goods of "three autonomies and one contract," spreading a perverse wind of "small contract work." This bourgeois element said what nonsense: the production team "should engage in seasonal contract work, divide into groups and contract down." Isn't this the same tune as China's Khrushchev shouting "agriculture should also retreat, including contracting production to households, individual farming"? This "retreat" and "contract" isn't it to contract production to households, retreat to the capitalist road? Wang ×× also said what nonsense: "No matter what, as long as the grain is increased, it's fine." Isn't this the same tune as the "famous" saying of another top walker of the capitalist road: "As long as it can increase production, individual farming is also fine, whether it's a white cat or a black cat, as long as it catches mice, it's a good cat"? They say "no matter what" on the left and "no matter what" on the right, as if as long as "the grain is increased," "no matter what" is fine. In fact, "no matter what," there is always "one thing," what do they ultimately want? Zhu Xikun in "Storm and Thunder" bluntly said their heart's words: "Whether it's capitalism or socialism, being able to fill one's stomach is goodism!" It is very clear that what they want is not socialism, but capitalism, that is, Khrushchev's "potato roast beef" "communism"!

	The tricks Zhu Yongkang and Wang ×× played are all wholesale from China's Khrushchev. China's Khrushchev is a smiling, knife-hiding villain, his revisionist black goods are poisonous pills wrapped in sugar coats. Don't be fooled by his smiling face today, giving you some "sweetness," once capitalism is restored, he will reveal his ferociousness, making us suffer again. China's Khrushchev is a smiling tiger with a scorpion's heart, how vicious! We must firmly hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, continue to carry out the great criticism of the revolution, and sweep all of China's Khrushchev's revisionist black goods into the garbage heap of history!

    剥去祝永康的伪装
    河北省抚宁县卢王庄公社桃园大队　王东生　李克明　王振元
    大毒草《风雷》里，写了一个“从天而降”的“英雄”祝永康。小说作者摇动黑笔杆，拚命为祝永康吹嘘，说他如何在“粮食紧张，烧草困难”的时候带来了三十万斤粮食，稳定了群众的情绪；如何在经济困难、人心不齐的情况下，组织大伙儿编席子，胜利地战胜了灾荒。一句话，祝永康似乎是一个关心群众疾苦，积极引导大伙儿走社会主义道路的“英雄”人物。
      “假的就是假的，伪装应当剥去。”用毛泽东思想对照一下，就不难看出：原来，祝永康是中国赫鲁晓夫的吹鼓手，他贩卖的是中国赫鲁晓夫那套修正主义的黑货。
    在遭受了自然灾害，群众生活发生困难的时候，关心群众疾苦是对的。但是，祝永康是怎么“关心群众疾苦”的呢？他不讲毛泽东思想，不讲奋发图强，自力更生的革命精神，而用带来的三十万斤粮食作资本，似乎有了粮就有了一切：反动富农黄龙飞等一伙不敢闹事了，受蒙蔽去闹粮的群众都“惭愧”了，大伙儿的生产积极性都提高了。这是关心群众的疾苦吗？根本不是！祝永康想用三十万斤粮食，收买人心，把自己打扮成“救苦救难”的“活菩萨”；祝永康想用三十万斤粮食，糊弄群众，让大伙儿把眼睛都盯在国家供给的粮食上，涣散群众的革命精神，腐蚀群众的革命意志。
    为了摆脱贫困，战胜灾荒，把大伙儿组织起来，走互助合作的道路是对的。但是，祝永康办的编席“互助组”是什么货色呢？这个“互助组”，成立的目的是为了做一笔“本薄利厚的生意”；这个“互助组”，生产方式是“各搞各的”；这个“互助组”，经营和分配的原则是“自负盈亏”，“编的多，多赚钱”。《风雷》里说，祝永康的编席“互助组”是社会主义的，朱锡坤提出的搞副业，下湖打兔子是资本主义的。其实，朱锡坤和祝永康是两块招牌，一路货色，“务”的都不是社会主义的“正业”，而是复辟资本主义！
    《风雷》里祝永康所干的那一套，我们桃园的贫下中农眼熟得很。这不是什么新鲜货，而是中国赫鲁晓夫的老婆王××在咱桃园所贩卖的那套修正主义的破烂货。
    中国赫鲁晓夫不是大肆鼓吹物质刺激吗？《风雷》里的祝永康带着三十万斤粮食，耀武扬威地来到了黄泥乡；中国赫鲁晓夫的老婆王××，也是装着满口袋的钱来到我们桃园的。为了对抗毛主席“农业学大寨”的伟大指示，使“桃园”“超过”大寨，中国赫鲁晓夫和他的老婆王××在这里大搞物质刺激，大刮反革命经济主义的妖风。他们慷国家之慨，调拨了国家大批资金，在桃园修扬水站，开灌溉渠，架设通往桃园的电线。他们利用权势，强迫省、专区、县在物资供应上要“满足需要，及时供应，优先桃园”。单拿化肥来说吧，就“优先”了桃园大队十五万三千多斤。邻队社员反映说：“桃园施化肥大把抓，我们施化肥用手掐。”中国赫鲁晓夫和他的老婆这一手真狠毒。他们拿国家的钱修这个修那个，就是要“修”掉桃园贫下中农自力更生的好传统；他们拿国家的钱送这个送那个，就是要笼络人心，窃誉盗名，为他们篡党篡国制造舆论。
      中国赫鲁晓夫不是极力宣扬“三自一包”吗？《风雷》里的祝永康立即挂着“互助合作”的招牌，搞起变相的单干；王××在桃园也拚命兜售“三自一包”的黑货，刮起了一股“小包工”的歪风。这个资产阶级分子胡说什么：生产队“要搞季节包工，分组包下去。”这跟中国赫鲁晓夫叫嚷的“农业上也要退够，包括包产到户，单干”不是一个调调吗？这一“退”一“包”，不是要包产到户，退到资本主义道路上去吗？王××还胡说什么：“不管怎样，只要把粮食搞上去就行”。这跟党内另一个最大的走资派的“名”言：“只要能增产，单干也可以，不管白猫黑猫，捉住老鼠就是好猫”不是一个腔调吗？他们左一个“不管”，右一个“不管”，似乎只要能把“粮食搞上去”，“不管怎样”都可以。其实，“不管怎样”，总有“一样”，他们要的究竟是什么呢？《风雷》里的朱锡坤赤裸裸地说出了他们的心里话：“资本主义也好，社会主义也好，能吃饱肚皮就是好主义！”十分清楚，他们要的根本不是社会主义，而是资本主义，也就是赫鲁晓夫“土豆烧牛肉”的“共产主义”！
    祝永康和王××所做的那一套，都是从中国赫鲁晓夫那里批发来的。中国赫鲁晓夫是个笑里藏刀的坏家伙，他那套修正主义的黑货是裹着糖衣的毒药。别看他今天满脸堆笑，给你些“甜头”，一旦资本主义复辟了，他就凶相毕露，叫我们重新吃苦头。中国赫鲁晓夫是笑面老虎蝎子心，可歹毒呢！我们一定要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，继续开展革命的大批判，把中国赫鲁晓夫的修正主义黑货统统扫进历史的垃圾堆！
