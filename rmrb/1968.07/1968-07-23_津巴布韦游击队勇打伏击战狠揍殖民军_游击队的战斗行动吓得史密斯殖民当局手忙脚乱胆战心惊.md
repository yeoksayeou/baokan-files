Zimbabwe guerrillas bravely launched an ambush battle, delivering a heavy blow to the colonial forces. The guerrilla's combat actions have left the Smith colonial regime in a state of panic and disarray.

New China News Agency, July 22nd: Reports from Salisbury indicate that the Zimbabwe guerrillas active in the northwestern part of Southern Rhodesia ambushed a platoon of Smith's colonial forces, supported by South African colonial troops, on the 17th in the Zambezi Valley. The ambush resulted in the deaths of fifteen enemy soldiers and the injury of five, including one South African colonial soldier killed and three wounded.

These South African mercenaries, since the second half of last year, have been collaborating with Smith's colonial forces to suppress the armed struggle of the Zimbabwean people.

According to reports, the brave guerrillas have continued to strike against Smith's colonial forces in this region since the 17th.

The Zimbabwe guerrillas' latest combat actions have left the trembling Smith colonial regime in a state of panic and disarray, hastily dispatching reinforcements from other parts of Southern Rhodesia to the Zambezi Valley.

Reports indicate that in the past few days, heavily guarded convoys have rapidly moved from Bulawayo towards the Wankie direction. Additionally, the "parliament" of Southern Rhodesia, on the 19th, hastily passed a resolution to extend the "state of emergency" that has been in effect in the South since November 1965 by another three months.

    津巴布韦游击队勇打伏击战狠揍殖民军
    游击队的战斗行动吓得史密斯殖民当局手忙脚乱胆战心惊
    新华社二十二日讯索尔兹伯里消息：活跃在南罗得西亚西北部的津巴布韦游击队，十七日在赞比西河谷地区伏击了一连得到南非殖民军支援的史密斯殖民军，打死敌人十五名，打伤五名，其中包括一名南非殖民军被打死，三名南非殖民军被打伤。
    这些南非帮凶军自去年下半年以来，一直在同史密斯殖民军一起，镇压津巴布韦人民的武装斗争。
    据报道，英勇的游击队从十七日以来继续在这一地区打击史密斯殖民军。
    津巴布韦游击队的这一新的战斗行动，使得胆战心惊的史密斯殖民当局手忙脚乱，急忙从南罗得西亚其他地方向赞比西河谷地区增派援军。
    据报道，在过去几天中，重兵护送的车队通过布拉瓦约城急速向万基方向开去。此外，南罗得西亚的“议会”十九日急忙通过决议，决定把自一九六五年十一月以来在南罗实行的“紧急状态”，再延长三个月。
