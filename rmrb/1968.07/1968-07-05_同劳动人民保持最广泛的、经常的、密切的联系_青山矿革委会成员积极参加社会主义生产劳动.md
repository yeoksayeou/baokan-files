	Maintaining the Broadest, Most Frequent, and Close Ties with the Working People
	Members of the Qing Shan Revolutionary Committee Actively Participate in Socialist Production Labor

	Through participating in collective production labor, the members of the Revolutionary Committee and the workers have maintained a close bond, and revolutionary workers have further united around the Revolutionary Committee, vigorously promoting the revolution and vigorously promoting production. In the past few months, they have completed the production plan ahead of schedule and in excess every month.

	According to Xinhua News Agency in Nanchang on July 4, the Qing Shan Mine Revolutionary Committee of the Pingxiang Mining Bureau, with the help of the PLA's leftist support troops, has carried forward the tradition of cadres participating in collective production labor advocated by Chairman Mao, and all committee members have been consistently participating in production labor. This has helped them maintain the broadest, most frequent, and close ties with all revolutionary workers in the mine, ensuring that the Revolutionary Committee is deeply rooted among the masses.

	The great leader Chairman Mao pointed out: "The Revolutionary Committee should implement unified leadership, break down redundant administrative structures, streamline administration, and organize a revolutionary leadership team that is connected with the masses." The Qing Shan Mine Revolutionary Committee believes that organizing members of the Revolutionary Committee to participate in collective production labor is a fundamental measure to "organize a revolutionary leadership team that is connected with the masses." It is a fundamental guarantee that members of the Revolutionary Committee will never detach themselves from the broad masses of workers and will never change their proletarian nature. Therefore, the Revolutionary Committee, upon its establishment in February this year, established a system where each member must participate in at least six days of shift production labor per month. Over the past four months, the full-time members of the Revolutionary Committee have averaged more than six days of labor per month, while the part-time members have consistently stayed at their production posts, averaging more than twenty-five days of labor per month. Through participating in collective production labor, the members of the Revolutionary Committee have maintained their proletarian nature and established a close bond with the workers. The relationship between the cadres and the masses is harmonious, and all revolutionary workers in the mine have united more closely around the Revolutionary Committee, making the revolution vigorous and production flourishing. In the past few months, they have completed the production plan ahead of schedule and in excess every month, and in June, they created a new production record for the rainy season since the mine's establishment.

	Continuously Improving the Consciousness of Participating in Labor

	Among the members of the Qing Shan Mine Revolutionary Committee, all mass representatives are workers, and all cadre representatives are of worker origin. The seniority of both old and new cadres is over eight years. Everyone is very enthusiastic about participating in production labor. At this time, some workers said to them: "You have been working for eight, nine, or even ten years, covered in coal dust and calluses on your hands. Now that you are members of the Revolutionary Committee, your work is busy, so you don't need to participate in labor. As long as you do your work well, we will work harder and bring out the coal you have dug." These words made the committee members ponder: Are we participating in labor just to dig more coal, or is it for the needs of the revolutionary cause and the need for ideological revolutionization? Everyone, with this question in mind, studied Chairman Mao's teachings: "Cadres must insist on participating in collective production labor. Our party and state cadres are ordinary laborers, not lords who sit on the heads of the people. Through participating in collective production labor, cadres maintain the broadest, most frequent, and close ties with the working people. This is a fundamental matter in the socialist system, which helps to overcome bureaucratism, prevent revisionism, and dogmatism." Chairman Mao's great teachings further enhanced everyone's understanding of the significance of cadres participating in labor. The deputy head of the Revolutionary Committee, Li Shoushun, and the standing committee member, Zhong Jiafu, are both labor models who have been working in the coal mines since they were teenagers and have dug coal for over a decade. After joining the Revolutionary Committee, they only detached from production due to work needs. However, they said: "Labor is our nature. Now, due to work needs, we have detached from production, but we must not detach from labor and the masses; if we detach from labor and the masses, we will lose our proletarian nature and will not be able to represent the masses, and we will not be worthy of being members of the Revolutionary Committee." They put their words into action. Since the establishment of the Revolutionary Committee, except for attending meetings, they have gone to the districts, teams, and groups to work and study with the workers. In this way, the workers have no reservations with them, and they are willing to share their thoughts.

	"Every bit of labor you miss, you lose a bit of your proletarian nature, and you distance yourself from the masses." This is the personal experience of Lai Mingyi, a member of the Revolutionary Committee and a revolutionary leading cadre. In the past, after being promoted from an ordinary coal miner to a cadre, he participated in labor less and less, eventually detaching from labor for a long time, distancing himself from the masses, and making mistakes. During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, he was criticized by the revolutionary masses. After becoming a member of the Revolutionary Committee, he returned to the worker masses he used to work with, digging coal with the workers, sweating profusely without resting, and making up for the labor missed due to meetings.

	Members of the Qing Shan Revolutionary Committee regard participating in labor as a need to maintain their proletarian nature, a need to connect with the masses, and a need for ideological revolutionization. Therefore, their consciousness of participating in labor is continuously improving, and they have formulated several regulations for ideological revolutionization and organizational revolutionization in labor, ensuring that the Revolutionary Committee is always deeply rooted among the masses.

	Participating in Labor with Proletarian Feelings for the Masses

	Not long after the establishment of the Qing Shan Mine Revolutionary Committee, three committee members once participated in labor in a backfilling area. The masses assigned them to the most humid and hot working face, with water dripping from above and flowing from below. They hadn't worked for long before they were drenched in sweat. The three committee members whispered to each other: Why did the masses assign us to this most arduous working face today? Is it because the masses don't care about us and lack feelings for us? However, they thought again, this idea was wrong. The masses only let them work in this working face once, and they felt that the masses didn't care about them and lacked feelings for them; but the workers worked in this working face all the time, why didn't they think about not caring for the workers and lacking feelings for the workers? Establishing ventilation facilities in this working face is relatively difficult, but as long as they think of a way, they can still lower the temperature. If they had deep class feelings for the workers, these problems could be discovered and solved in time. They recalled Chairman Mao's teachings: "Production by the masses, interests of the masses, experience of the masses, emotions of the masses, these are all things that leading cadres should pay attention to at all times." Comparing themselves with this teaching, they deeply felt that they cared too little for the worker masses and still lacked deep proletarian feelings for the worker masses.

	The three committee members, through labor, deepened their proletarian feelings for the workers and immediately studied with the workers how to lower the temperature in the most humid and hot working face. They also took the initiative to open ventilation shafts, improve ventilation facilities, and lower the temperature.

	Members of the Qing Shan Revolutionary Committee all have such personal experiences: Participating in labor once, their hearts become closer to the workers; sweating once, their class feelings for the workers deepen. They have felt from their personal practices that to always maintain close ties with the masses, they must first have deep proletarian feelings for the masses. Without these feelings, connecting with the masses is superficial and unstable. With these feelings, connecting with the masses is real and stable. To strengthen these proletarian feelings, they must go to the masses and go to labor.

	In Labor, One Must Be Willing to Be a Student of the Masses

	Members of the Qing Shan Mine Revolutionary Committee have also experienced the following process in participating in production labor: At the beginning, the masses treated them as outsiders and did not pay much attention to their labor. Later, they treated them as ordinary members of the masses and treated them like ordinary workers. This change was the result of the committee members putting down their airs, looking down, and being willing to be students of the masses. The worker-origin committee head, Wu Duanyu, was assigned a task by the team leader when he first participated in labor in a team. The team leader said, "You can work anywhere." After participating in labor in a working face, the masses did not pay much attention to how he worked. Everyone treated him as a guest. This situation made Wu Duanyu ponder: Why didn't the team leader dare to assign tasks to him? Why didn't the masses dare to manage him? He decided to change this situation. He worked and transported coal with the workers while talking with them. An old worker said: "In the past, some cadres in the mine only led but did not take the lead; only stayed above but did not go below; when they went below, they had an air of superiority, and they just did not put us workers in their eyes." The old worker's words made Wu Duanyu suddenly think of himself. Today, going down to the mine to work is different from going down to the mine to work in the past. His mind had an extra thought that he was a "leader," and his actions were different from when he was a worker in the past. The masses' treatment of him was also different from the past. Wu Duanyu realized at this time that it was not that the team leader did not dare to assign tasks to him and the masses did not dare to manage him, but that he had not solved the problem of accepting the masses' leadership in his mind. To truly blend in with the masses in labor, he must look down, put down his airs, and be willing to be a student of the masses.

	Wu Duanyu brought the gains from this participation in labor to the full committee meeting of the Revolutionary Committee, which was agreed upon by all committee members. They examined the existence of bourgeois old ideas and old styles in the Revolutionary Committee that did not put the worker masses in their eyes, studied Chairman Mao's teachings of "the masses are the real heroes" and "the people have limitless creativity," and further strengthened their mass consciousness and resolved to be students of the masses.

	Since then, members of the Qing Shan Revolutionary Committee have participated in labor with the attitude of students, and the workers have treated the committee members as ordinary members of the masses, respecting them even more, trusting them even more, and supporting them even more.

### 同劳动人民保持最广泛的、经常的、密切的联系  青山矿革委会成员积极参加社会主义生产劳动

    同劳动人民保持最广泛的、经常的、密切的联系
    青山矿革委会成员积极参加社会主义生产劳动
    通过参加集体生产劳动，革委会成员和工人群众保持了血肉联系，革命职工进一步团结在革委会周围，狠抓革命，猛促生产，几个月来，月月提前超额完成生产计划
    据新华社南昌四日电　萍乡矿务局青山矿革命委员会，在人民解放军支左部队的帮助下，发扬毛主席一贯提倡的干部必须坚持参加集体生产劳动的传统作风，全体委员一直坚持参加生产劳动，从而同全矿革命职工保持了最广泛的、经常的、密切的联系，使革命委员会深深扎根于群众之中。
    伟大领袖毛主席指出：“革命委员会要实行一元化的领导，打破重叠的行政机构，精兵简政，组织起一个革命化的联系群众的领导班子。”青山矿革命委员会认为组织革委会成员参加集体生产劳动是“组织起一个革命化的联系群众的领导班子”的一条根本性的措施，是使革委会成员永不脱离广大工人群众，永不改变工人阶级本色的一项根本性的保证。因此，革命委员会于今年二月一成立，就建立了革委会成员每人每月最少要参加六天顶班生产劳动的制度。四个多月来，革委会中脱产的成员平均每人每月参加劳动都在六天以上，不脱产的成员始终坚守生产岗位，每人每月平均参加劳动二十五天以上。通过参加集体生产劳动，革委会成员保持了工人阶级的本色，和工人群众建立了血肉联系，干群关系水乳相融，全矿革命职工更加紧密地团结在革委会的周围，把革命搞得轰轰烈烈，生产搞得热气腾腾，几个月来，月月提前超额完成生产计划，六月份还创造了建矿以来雨季最高生产纪录。
        不断提高参加劳动的自觉性
    青山矿革命委员会的成员中，革命群众代表全部是工人，革命干部代表全部是工人出身，新老干部的工龄都在八年以上。大家参加生产劳动的积极性都很高。这时，有的群众对他们说：你们一身煤、一手茧，已经劳动了八、九、十几年，现在当了革委会成员，工作又忙，就不要参加劳动了嘛。你们只要做好工作，我们加把劲，就把你们参加劳动挖的煤带出来了。这些话引起了革委会委员们的深思，作为革委会成员是单纯为了多挖煤去参加劳动，还是为了革命事业的需要，为了思想革命化的需要而参加劳动呢？大家带着这个问题，学习了毛主席的教导：“必须坚持干部参加集体生产劳动的制度。我们党和国家的干部是普通劳动者，而不是骑在人民头上的老爷。干部通过参加集体生产劳动，同劳动人民保持最广泛的、经常的、密切的联系。这是社会主义制度下一件带根本性的大事，它有助于克服官僚主义，防止修正主义和教条主义。”毛主席的伟大教导使大家进一步提高了对干部参加劳动的意义的认识。革委会副主任黎守顺和常委钟家福，都是十几岁下煤窑、挖了十几年煤的劳动模范，参加革委会后，因工作需要，才脱了产。但是，他们说：“劳动是我们的本色。现在因工作需要脱了产，但决不能由此脱离劳动，脱离群众；如果脱离劳动，脱离群众，就失掉了工人阶级的本色，就不能代表群众，就不配做革命委员会成员。”他们说到做到。自从革委会成立以来，除了开会，他们都下到区、班、组里去，和工人一起劳动、学习。这样，工人们就和他们毫无隔阂，心里话都愿意跟他们说。
      “少参加一分劳动，就丢掉一分工人阶级的本色，就远离群众一分。”这是革委会委员、革命领导干部赖明义的切身体会。过去，他由普通的挖煤工人提拔为干部后，参加劳动越来越少，最后长期脱离劳动，远离了群众，犯了错误，在无产阶级文化大革命中受到了革命群众的批评。他当上了革委会成员后，就以“搞好思想革命化，永不脱离劳动”的决心，回到过去和他在一起劳动的工人群众中去，和工人一起下井挖煤，浑身淌大汗也不休息，开会耽误了劳动，也要设法补上。
    青山矿革委会成员把参加劳动看做是保持工人阶级本色的需要，是联系群众的需要，是实现思想革命化的需要，因而参加劳动的自觉性越来越高，并且在劳动中制订了思想革命化与组织革命化的若干规定，使革命委员会永远深深扎根于群众之中。
    怀着对群众的无产阶级感情参加劳动
    青山矿革命委员会成立不久，一次，三个委员来到一个回采区参加劳动，群众把他们分配到一个最湿、最热的工作面，上面滴水，下面流水，还没干一会儿，就通身流汗。三个委员就暗中嘀咕：群众今天为什么偏偏把我们分配到这个最艰苦的工作面？是不是群众不关心我们，对我们缺乏感情？但是他们转念一想，自己这个想法不对。群众只让自己到这个工作面劳动一次，就感到群众对自己不关心，缺乏感情；而工人们经常在这个工作面劳动，为什么就不想到自己不关心工人，对工人们缺乏感情呢？这个工作面建立通风设施虽然比较困难，但是，只要想办法，还是可以降低温度的。如果自己对工人们有深厚的阶级感情，这些问题是可以及时发现和解决的。他们想起了毛主席的教导：“群众生产，群众利益，群众经验，群众情绪，这些都是领导干部们应时刻注意的。”对照这一教导检查自己，他们深深感到自己对工人群众关心不够，对工人群众还缺乏深厚的无产阶级感情。
    三个委员通过劳动加深了自己对工人们的无产阶级感情，立即和工人们一同研究了在那个最湿、最热的工作面降温的方法，还亲自动手，开设了风道，改善了通风设施，降低了温度。
    青山矿革委会成员都有这样一个切身体会：参加一次劳动，和工人们的心亲近一分，出一身汗水，和工人们的阶级感情加深一层。他们从亲身实践中感到，要永远同群众保持密切联系，首先要对群众有深厚的无产阶级感情，没有这种感情，联系群众就是表面的，不牢固的，有了这种感情，联系群众才是实在的，牢固的。而要增强这种无产阶级感情，就要到群众中去，到劳动中去。
  在劳动中必须甘当群众的小学生
    青山矿革命委员会成员在参加生产劳动中，还经历过这样一段过程：开始时，群众把他们当作外人看待，对他们劳动不大过问，到后来把他们看做群众中的普通一员，对待他们象对待普通工人一样。这个变化，是革委会成员放下架子，眼睛向下，甘当群众小学生的结果。工人出身的革委会主任吴端柳第一次到一个班组参加劳动的时候，要求班组长分配他工作任务。班长回答说，你到那里劳动都行。他在一个工作面参加劳动后，劳动得怎么样，群众不大过问。大家把他当做客人看待。这种情况引起了吴端柳的深思：班组长为什么不敢指挥自己？群众为什么不敢管我？他下决心要改变这种状况，他一面和工人们一起挖煤、运煤，一面和工人们交谈。一个老工人说：“过去矿里的一些干部，只当头，不带头；只在上头，不到下头；到了下头，一副派头，就是不把我们工人放在眼里头。”老工人的一席话，使吴端柳一下子联想到自己，今天下井劳动和过去下井劳动就不一样，自己的思想深处多了一个自己是“头头”的想法，行动上就和过去当工人不一样，群众对待自己也就和过去不一样。吴端柳这时认识到，不是班组长不敢指挥自己，群众不敢管自己，而是自己从思想上没有解决接受群众指挥的问题。要真正在劳动中和群众打成一片，就必须眼睛向下，放下架子，甘当群众的小学生。
    吴端柳把这次参加劳动的收获带到革委会全体委员会上来，得到了全体委员的赞同。大家检查了革委会存在的不把工人群众放在眼里头的资产阶级的旧观点、旧作风，学习了毛主席的“群众是真正的英雄”和“人民群众有无限的创造力”等教导，更加增强了群众观念，坚定了当群众小学生的决心。
    从此以后，青山矿革委会成员参加劳动时就完全以小学生的姿态出现在工人群众当中，工人也就把革委会成员当做群众中的普通一员，更加尊敬他们，更加信任他们，更加支持他们。
