The village of Liu Ping Temple, east of Zhangjiakou City, is a place where Wang Guozhu, a student, had visited more than a year ago. At that time, Wang Guozhu had just been inspected by Chairman Mao in Beijing and came here with a heart full of revolutionary fervor to temper himself in the countryside. During heart-to-heart talks with the poor and lower-middle peasants, he learned that the place was short of people but had plenty of land, and it needed cultured revolutionary youths. From then on, Wang Guozhu fell in love with this place from the bottom of his heart. He decided to settle here after graduating from high school. Unexpectedly, when the Revolutionary Committee approved his request to settle in this village, he began to hesitate.

It turned out that not long ago, he had visited this village again and learned that they were in the process of cleaning up class ranks. Because this place had been repeatedly contested by the Eighth Route Army and the reactionary Kuomintang in the past, and most of the villagers were either from the same clan or relatives, class struggle was very complex. Wang Guozhu was afraid that if he settled here, he might fall into a trap, so he hesitated.

The commander of the military training team, Wang, saw through his thoughts at a glance and kindly said to him, "Little Wang, let's hold a study session!"

Wang, the commander, first studied Chairman Mao's works with Little Wang. The more they studied, the more uneasy Little Wang felt. Especially when they came to the passage, "We go to work and struggle to solve difficulties. The more difficult the place, the more we should go there. This is what a good comrade should do," Little Wang unconsciously felt his face flush. He thought, "Yes, Chairman Mao calls on us to go to difficult places, but I hesitate as soon as I encounter difficulties. What kind of attitude is this? Isn't this fearing difficulties and avoiding struggles? Isn't this being disloyal to Chairman Mao?" Thinking of this, he excitedly said, "Commander, rest assured, I am Chairman Mao's Red Guard. Wherever Chairman Mao points, I will rush there. The more complex the class struggle in Liu Ping Temple, the more I should go there and resolutely guard the revolutionary line of Chairman Mao!"

Wang, the commander, saw that Little Wang had come to his senses and happily said, "That's right, as long as you remember Chairman Mao's teaching, 'Even great winds and waves are not to be feared,' there is no difficulty that cannot be overcome!"

Little Wang's thoughts took a leap forward. He returned to the classroom, opened his diary, and wrote down his oath: "Fear no hardship, fear no difficulty, go to the great winds and waves to temper oneself."

    坚定——犹豫——坚定
    张家口城东刘平寺大队是王国柱同学一年多以前到过的一个地方。当时，王国柱刚刚在北京接受了毛主席的检阅，就怀着一颗到农村锻炼的红心来到了这里，在和贫下中农促膝谈心中，他了解到这里人少地多，很需要有文化的革命青年。从此，王国柱就打心眼里爱上了这个地方。他决心高中毕业后，到这里落户。没想到革委会批准他到这个村子去落户的时候，他反而犹豫起来。
    原来，不久前，他又到这个村子转了一趟，了解到那里正在清理阶级队伍。由于这里过去是八路军和国民党反动派反复争夺过的地方，加上这个村里绝大多数不是同宗，就是亲戚，阶级斗争很复杂。王国柱害怕到这里落户弄不好会摔跟头，因此有些犹豫。
    军训团王团长一眼看穿了他的心思，就亲切地对他说：“小王，咱俩办个学习班吧！”
    王团长首先和小王一块学习毛主席著作，越学小王越感到不安，特别是学到“我们是为着解决困难去工作、去斗争的。越是困难的地方越是要去，这才是好同志”时，小王不知不觉脸上有些发烧。他想，是呀，毛主席号召我们到困难的地方去，而自己一发现困难就不想去了，这算什么呢？这不就是害怕困难，躲避斗争吗？这不就是对毛主席不忠吗？想到这里，他激动地说：“团长，你放心，我是毛主席的红卫兵，毛主席指向那里，我就奔向那里。刘平寺阶级斗争越复杂，我越是要去，坚决为毛主席的革命路线放好哨、站好岗、打好仗！”
    王团长看到小王想通了，高兴地说：“对，只要记住毛主席‘大风大浪也不可怕’的教导，就没有克服不了的困难！”
    小王思想上有了飞跃，他回到教室，打开日记本，写下了自己的誓言：“不怕苦，不怕难，到大风大浪中去锻炼。”
