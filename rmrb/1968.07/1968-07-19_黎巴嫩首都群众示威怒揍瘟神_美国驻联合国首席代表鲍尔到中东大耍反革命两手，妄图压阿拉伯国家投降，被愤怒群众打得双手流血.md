The American Chief Representative to the United Nations, Arthur J. Goldberg, who has been shuttling around the Middle East, was beaten by Arab crowds upon his arrival at Beirut airport on July 17. His hands were injured by stones thrown by the demonstrators. The angry crowd shouted slogans such as "American imperialism is the enemy of the Arab people!" and "Goldberg, go back!"

The demonstrators also held up many placards with slogans such as "The only way to solve the Palestinian problem is by force!" "We will never negotiate with the Zionists!" and "The Arab nation will never forget that the United States supports Israel!"

Goldberg's entourage, including the U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for International Organization Affairs, Philip C. Habib, and the U.S. Ambassador to Lebanon, Dwight C. Parker, were also attacked. After disembarking, they hid in the airport's VIP lounge, but the number of demonstrators outside grew from over a hundred to several hundred, continuously shouting anti-American imperialism, anti-United Nations resolutions, and anti-"peace" slogans. Goldberg and his group hastily left the lounge and rushed to the U.S. Embassy's car, intending to escape to the embassy. The enraged demonstrators threw stones and soda bottles, shattering the car windows and injuring Goldberg's hands.

Goldberg was recently appointed by the Johnson administration as the U.S. Chief Representative to the United Nations. Previously, he served as the U.S. Deputy Secretary of State and was a key figure in formulating and implementing U.S. imperialist aggression policies. This time, after assuming his new post, he immediately rushed to the Middle East to further push the U.S.'s two-pronged counter-revolutionary policy in the region: on one hand, providing military support to the Israeli Zionists to suppress Arab national liberation movements, particularly the armed struggle of the Palestinian people; on the other hand, pushing the so-called "political solution" to deceive Arab countries into accepting terms of surrender and giving up their rights.

Upon arriving in the Middle East, Goldberg first went to Israel. According to reports, after arriving in Tel Aviv on July 14, Goldberg discussed further U.S. military aid to Israel with the Israeli reactionary authorities. Although Goldberg's stay in Israel was only two days, he, accompanied by Israeli military and political officials, specially "inspected" the military outposts in the Golan Heights and the areas south of the Sea of Galilee, which were occupied by the U.S.-Israel aggression in the June 1967 war. The activities of Palestinian guerrillas in these areas are thriving and have been repeatedly striking heavy blows against the U.S.-Israeli aggressors. Goldberg's activities indicate that the U.S. and Israel are jointly planning further military measures against Arab countries and the suppression of the Palestinian people.

In addition to military suppression, Goldberg and the Israeli reactionary authorities also focused on discussing the promotion of the "political solution" deception. According to reports, Goldberg handed over a "personal letter" from U.S. President Johnson to Israeli Prime Minister Levi Eshkol, reaffirming the U.S.'s "five-point plan" for solving the Middle East problem. The Israeli reactionary regime's foreign ministry spokesman announced on July 15 that Goldberg and the Israeli side both expressed support for the United Nations "envoy" Gunnar Jarring's mission to seek a so-called "political solution." Goldberg left Israel on July 16, stopped by Jordan, and arrived in Beirut on July 17, where he openly admitted that his purpose was to "support Jarring's mission, seek the scope of agreement, and jointly formulate a solution."

However, whether it is military suppression or "political solution," the Arab people have seen through the essence of U.S. imperialism's two-pronged counter-revolutionary policy. Goldberg being beaten by the Arab crowd in Beirut airport, with his hands bleeding, is a powerful proof. It foreshadows that U.S. imperialism's aggression and interference policy in the Middle East will inevitably suffer a complete failure.

    黎巴嫩首都群众示威怒揍瘟神
    美国驻联合国首席代表鲍尔到中东大耍反革命两手，妄图压阿拉伯国家投降，被愤怒群众打得双手流血
    新华社大马士革十八日电　据贝鲁特的报纸报道，目前正在中东地区东跳西窜的美国驻联合国首席代表鲍尔，十七日一到达黎巴嫩首都贝鲁特机场，就被阿拉伯人民用石头把他的两只手打伤了。示威的阿拉伯群众愤怒地高呼：“美帝国主义是阿拉伯人民的敌人！”“鲍尔滚回去！”
    示威群众还高举着许多标语牌，上面写着：“用武力取得自由是解决巴勒斯坦问题的唯一办法！”“决不和犹太复国主义者和平谈判！”“阿拉伯民族决不会忘记美国支持以色列！”等口号。
    和鲍尔一起挨揍的有他的随行人员美国负责国际组织事务的助理国务卿西斯科，以及前往机场迎接他们的美国驻黎巴嫩大使波特等。他们下飞机以后就躲在机场“贵宾候机室”，但外面示威的群众越来越多，从一百多人增加到好几百人，不断高呼反对美帝国主义、反对联合国决议、反对所谓“和平”解决的口号。鲍尔等慌忙从机场候机室中溜出来，跳上美国大使馆的汽车，准备逃往美国大使馆。愤怒的示威群众用石头和汽水瓶砸碎了汽车的窗户，打伤了鲍尔的双手。
    鲍尔是新近被约翰逊政府任命为美国驻联合国首席代表的。他过去当过美国副国务卿，是决定和推行美帝国主义侵略政策的一个重要角色。这次，在他就任美国驻联合国首席代表以后，首先跑到中东去，就是为了进一步推行美国在中东的反革命两手政策：一面在军事上大力支持以色列犹太复国主义者，镇压阿拉伯的民族解放运动，特别是镇压巴勒斯坦人民的武装斗争；一面在政治上加紧推行所谓“政治解决”骗局，企图诱迫阿拉伯国家接受丧权失地的条件，向美以侵略者投降。
    鲍尔这次一到中东就往以色列那里跑。据报道，鲍尔七月十四日到特拉维夫以后，就和以色列反动当局讨论了美国进一步从军事上援助以色列的问题。鲍尔在以色列停留的时间虽然不过两天，但他在以色列军政人员陪同下，特地去“视察”了美以在去年六月的侵略战争中从叙利亚侵占的戈兰高地以及太比里亚斯湖以南的地区的“军事据点”。这些地区的巴勒斯坦游击队的活动正在蓬勃开展，不断给予美以侵略者以沉重的打击。鲍尔的这些活动说明，美以正在共同策划进一步反对阿拉伯国家和镇压巴勒斯坦人民的军事措施。
    除了军事一手以外，鲍尔和以色列反动当局还着重讨论了加紧推行“政治解决”骗局的问题。据报道，鲍尔递交了美国总统约翰逊给以色列反动当局的总理艾希科尔一封“私人信件”，重申了美国解决中东问题的“五点计划”。以色列反动政权的外交部发言人十五日宣布，鲍尔和以色列方面在会谈中都表示支持联合国“特使”雅林寻求所谓“政治解决”的使命。鲍尔十六日离开以色列，经过约旦，十七日到达贝鲁特以后也公开承认，他的目的是要“支持雅林的使命，寻求协议的范围，以便共同制定一个解决的办法”。
    但是，军事镇压也罢，“政治解决”也罢，阿拉伯人民看透了美帝国主义的反革命两手政策的实质。鲍尔在贝鲁特机场被阿拉伯人民打得双手流血就是一个有力的证明。它预示着美帝国主义在中东的侵略和干涉政策，必将遭到彻底的失败。
