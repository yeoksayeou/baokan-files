The fascist military clique in Indonesia is frenziedly implementing anti-communist and anti-people policies, which has earned the praise of their American masters.

A recent report by the Antara News Agency published in the reactionary Jakarta newspaper "Anpera" stated: Reliable U.S. sources revealed that in the past three years, since the establishment of the fascist regime by the Sukarno-Nasution clique in Indonesia, the U.S. has "placed Indonesia in a positive light." The report shamelessly boasted that U.S. imperialism "admires" the counter-revolutionary actions of the Indonesian fascist military regime in brutally suppressing the Communist Party, and that the U.S. Congress and government are "more optimistic" about Indonesia's improving situation.

Everyone knows that in October 1965, the right-wing military clique led by Sukarno and Nasution staged a counter-revolutionary coup. These faithful dogs of U.S. imperialism established an unprecedentedly brutal fascist dictatorship in Indonesia. They massacred hundreds of thousands of Communists and revolutionary people, turning the archipelago into a vast hell.

According to a recent article published in the British magazine "East and West," the Indonesian fascist military regime's crimes against communists and the people were carried out under the orders of U.S. imperialism. The article stated that officials from the U.S. embassy in Jakarta, acting on behalf of the U.S. government, instructed the Sukarno-Nasution fascist military regime to "move more decisively in suppressing the left-wing opposition." This would "positively influence Washington's attitude towards Indonesia's economic aid requests." It is no surprise that the Indonesian fascist military clique, which is frenziedly anti-communist and anti-people, received praise from their American masters. However, these slaves' counter-revolutionary crimes will not escape the punishment of the Indonesian people.

    印尼反动派甘当美帝反共工具
    新华社十九日讯  雅加达消息：印尼法西斯军人集团疯狂推行反共反人民的政策，深得其美国主子的赞赏。
    雅加达反动报纸《安佩拉报》不久前刊登一条安塔拉通讯社的消息说：美国非常可靠的人士透露，近三年来苏哈托—纳苏蒂安之流在印尼建立法西斯政权后，美国“把印尼放在肯定的方面”。这条消息还恬不知耻地宣扬，美帝国主义对印尼法西斯军人政权疯狂镇压共产党的反革命行径表示“钦佩”，“美国国会和政府对印尼的朝向好转感到更加乐观”。
    大家知道，一九六五年十月，以苏哈托、纳苏蒂安为首的右派军人集团发动反革命政变以来，这伙美帝国主义的忠实走狗在印尼建立了空前残暴的法西斯专政。他们屠杀了几十万共产党人和革命人民，把千岛之国变成了一座大地狱。
    据英国《东方世界》月刊最近发表的文章透露，印尼法西斯军人政权反共反人民的罪恶行径，是在美帝国主义的指使下干的。文章说，美国驻雅加达大使馆的官员们奉美国政府之命，要苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯军人政权“朝着更坚决地镇压左翼反对派的方向走去。这将积极影响华盛顿对待印尼经济援助要求的态度”。疯狂反共、反人民的印尼法西斯军人集团受到他们的美国主子的夸奖，是毫不奇怪的。但是这伙奴才的反革命罪行，决逃脱不了印尼人民的惩罚。
