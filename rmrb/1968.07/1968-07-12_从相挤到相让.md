Passengers come from all directions, and they do not know each other. Can a study class be held? Passengers are scattered and mobile, and there are all kinds of problems. Can a study class be well organized? The practice of holding Mao Zedong Thought study classes among waiting passengers at the Shijiazhuang Railway Station has answered these questions. The following are two vivid examples that occurred at the Shijiazhuang Railway Station. These two incidents once again prove: where there are people, where there are problems, Mao Zedong Thought study classes can be held and are needed; no matter how complex or difficult the problems are, as long as there is the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, they can all be solved. —Editor

	From Pushing to Yielding

	On January 9 of this year, the Shijiazhuang Railway Station, a major passenger transfer station on the Jingguang Line, saw a significant increase in waiting passengers. That evening, two express trains were scheduled to pass through, but only about 120 tickets could be sold, creating a substantial gap between the number of passengers and the available tickets, leading to considerable crowding.

	What should be done? In the past, when such situations arose, the service staff would simply sell the tickets in the order of the passengers' arrival. However, on that day, the service staff were seriously considering how to handle the situation according to Mao Zedong Thought, and to reasonably solve the problem of more people and fewer tickets. They followed Chairman Mao's instruction: "Holding study classes is a good method; many problems can be solved in study classes." They promptly organized a Mao Zedong Thought study class in the ticket hall, leading everyone to study Chairman Mao's latest instructions and the teachings from "In Memory of Norman Bethune": "We all come from different places, but we have gathered together for a common revolutionary goal.... All revolutionary comrades must care for, love, and help each other." The service staff said, "We must do everything according to Chairman Mao's teachings. Today, with fewer tickets and more people, we must care for, love, and help each other." The service staff then proposed a suggestion for the passengers to consider: whether long-distance passengers could take the express trains today, and short-distance passengers could take the slower trains tomorrow, thus reducing the inconvenience of changing trains for long-distance passengers. The short-distance passengers unanimously agreed, saying, "Long-distance passengers should go first; we can take the short-distance trains tomorrow." At this point, five short-distance passengers still hoped to take the express train, some showing telegrams, others explaining that they had urgent matters. The service staff inquired about the situation of these five passengers and explained it to everyone. The long-distance passengers said, "We should still act according to Chairman Mao's teachings on mutual care among all revolutionary comrades. Those with urgent matters should go first!"

	The Shijiazhuang Railway Station used Mao Zedong Thought to unify the passengers' thinking, and the problem was solved. The ticket-selling work began smoothly. At this time, the service staff sought the passengers' opinions on the station's service work. They said, "Chairman Mao teaches us: 'Since we are serving the people, we should not be afraid of criticism and pointing out our shortcomings.' We hope everyone will criticize our shortcomings." The passengers said, "We have attended a lively Mao Zedong Thought class here. Such difficult problems that were hard to solve in the past have been resolved through holding Mao Zedong Thought study classes. You have done a good job!"

专栏：在毛泽东思想学习班里

    “旅客来自四面八方，互不相识，能办学习班吗？”“旅客流动分散，存在各种各样的问题，能办好学习班吗？”石家庄火车站在候车旅客中举办毛泽东思想学习班的实践，回答了这个问题。下面就是发生在石家庄火车站的两则生动的事例。这两件事再一次证明：哪里有群众，哪里有问题，就可以办、就需要办毛泽东思想学习班；哪怕再复杂、再棘手的问题，只要有了毛泽东思想的指引，都可以得到解决。　　　　　　　　　　　　　　——编者
    从相挤到相让
    今年一月九日，京广线上较大的旅客中转站——石家庄火车站，候车旅客大大增加，而当天晚上通过这里的两次快车，预计只能卖一百二十张车票，与候车人数差额颇大，相当拥挤。
    怎么办呢？过去遇到这种情况，服务员总是按照旅客先来后到的次序把票售完了事。那天，服务员却在认真地考虑如何按照毛泽东思想办事，合理地解决人多票少的问题。他们遵照毛主席关于“办学习班，是个好办法，很多问题可以在学习班得到解决”的教导，及时在售票大厅办起了旅客毛泽东思想学习班，组织大家学习了毛主席的最新指示和《为人民服务》中的教导：“我们都是来自五湖四海，为了一个共同的革命目标，走到一起来了。……一切革命队伍的人都要互相关心，互相爱护，互相帮助。”服务员说：“我们办任何事情，都要按照毛主席的教导去做。今天票少人多，我们要互相关心，互相爱护，互相帮助。”服务员接着提出一个建议请旅客考虑：是否可以让长途旅客坐今天的快车，短途旅客坐明天的慢车，这样可以给长途旅客减少中途换车的麻烦。短途的旅客们纷纷表示同意，都说：“应当先让长途旅客走，我们搭短途的明天再走。”这时有五位短途旅客还希望搭快车，有的拿出电报，有的说明自己有急事。服务员一一了解之后，又把这五位旅客的情况向大家说明。长途旅客说：“还是按照毛主席关于一切革命队伍的人都要互相关心的教导办事，有急事的就先走吧！”
    石家庄火车站用毛泽东思想统一了旅客的思想，问题解决了，售票工作顺利开始了。这时，服务员又征求旅客们对车站服务工作的意见。他们说：“毛主席教导我们：‘因为我们是为人民服务的，所以，我们如果有缺点，就不怕别人批评指出。’希望大家对我们的缺点提出批评。”旅客们说：“我们在这里上了一堂生动的毛泽东思想课。象这种过去很不好解决的困难问题，通过办毛泽东思想学习班就解决了，你们做得好！”
