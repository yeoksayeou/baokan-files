The county of Ping Shan in Hebei Province, where Xiangshan was located during the War of Liberation, was once the site of the Party Central Committee and the venue for the Seventh Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee. Twenty years ago, the broad revolutionary masses of Ping Shan County, who received the earnest teachings of the great leader Chairman Mao, have upheld and carried forward the glorious traditions of the past. In the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, they have closely followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments, launched a fierce attack on a handful of capitalist roaders within the old county committee, and finally achieved decisive victories in the struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines. On May 23 of last year, the Ping Shan County Revolutionary Committee was established.

The most fundamental thing is to link up with the masses.

The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "The distinguishing feature of our Communist Party from all other political parties is that we have the closest ties with the broadest masses of the people." "The reform of state organs, the most fundamental thing, is to link up with the masses."

After the establishment of the Ping Shan County Revolutionary Committee, some comrades advocated first "setting up the table," building the organs. The responsible comrades of the People's Liberation Army Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team stationed in Ping Shan County promptly pointed out: The organs should be built, but they should not stay at home "setting up the table." The important thing is to establish the fine style of closely linking up with the masses. The Revolutionary Committee first spent three days studying Chairman Mao's teachings on linking up with the masses, organized the members of the Revolutionary Committee to visit the Xiangshan Revolutionary Historical Memorial Hall, and viewed the great deeds of the great leader Chairman Mao, who, twenty years ago, selected rice seeds, planted rice, and harvested rice with the broad poor and lower-middle peasants. They also saw the sickle that Chairman Mao had personally used. With excited hearts, they expressed their determination to learn from Chairman Mao's brilliant thoughts and great revolutionary practices on closely linking up with the masses. They immediately shouldered their backpacks, went deep into the countryside, and, with the broad poor and lower-middle peasants, vigorously grasped class struggle, promoted production with revolution. Where the class struggle was complex, where there were many problems, where it was most arduous, and where it was most remote, they competed to go there. The Ma Lu Yu Production Brigade of Ta Ya Commune is located in a mountainous area, and the cadres of the old county committee had never been there before. Liu Guisheng, a standing committee member of the county Revolutionary Committee, followed Chairman Mao's teachings, shouldered his backpack, crossed mountains and valleys, and came to this production brigade to set up a work point. As soon as he arrived at the production brigade, he put down his backpack and worked with the peasants. He found out who was short of firewood and personally went up the mountain to cut and deliver it. He studied Chairman Mao's works with the broad poor and lower-middle peasants, criticized the black goods of the "three selfs and one package" and "four freedoms" of the Chinese Khrushchev and his ilk, and effectively promoted the ideological revolutionization of the community members, pushing forward the development of revolution and production. Last autumn, the average yield per mu of this production brigade increased from 800 jin of the previous year to more than 1,000 jin.

The Revolutionary Committee's style of closely linking up with the masses has been warmly praised by the revolutionary masses. Poor and lower-middle peasants reflected: "They are really our good leaders, with hearts connected to ours, the poor and lower-middle peasants." However, a handful of class enemies were terrified and hated it to the core. They attempted to disrupt the close ties between the Revolutionary Committee and the broad revolutionary masses and, starting from early June last year, began to spread rumors everywhere, slandering the revolutionary three-in-one combination Revolutionary Committee as "three patch-ups," and maliciously stirring up opposition between the masses and the Revolutionary Committee.

In the face of the rampant attacks of a handful of class enemies, what should be done? They believed: The main force should be placed in the countryside, deep into the masses, to arm the masses with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought and lead the masses to fight against the enemy.

Before the Revolutionary Committee members went to the countryside, they visited the Xiangshan Revolutionary Historical Memorial Hall again and studied Chairman Mao's teachings on closely linking up with the masses. They said: Our revolutionary power is established in the hearts of the 330,000 revolutionary people of the whole county. The newly born Revolutionary Committee is born in the struggle of the revolutionary masses of the whole county against the class enemies and must also be cherished, defended, consolidated, and developed by the revolutionary masses of the whole county.

With the help of the People's Liberation Army, the Revolutionary Committee mobilized the broad cadres of the organs and the revolutionary workers, peasants, and Red Guards to organize a 10,000-strong Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team, led by the responsible comrades of the Revolutionary Committee, to go deep into all 52 communes and 708 production brigades of the county, to widely and deeply propagate Chairman Mao's latest series of instructions, to arm the masses with Mao Zedong Thought, and to severely strike at a handful of class enemies. In a production brigade in a deep mountain area, some peasants were incited by bad elements to have opposing sentiments towards the Revolutionary Committee. Li Qingrui, the chairman of the county Revolutionary Committee, led the members of the Revolutionary Committee to go deep into this brigade, to study Mao Zedong Thought with the broad poor and lower-middle peasants, to eat, live, and work together. The class consciousness of the broad poor and lower-middle peasants was greatly enhanced, and they quickly exposed the class enemies' plots and increased their trust in the county Revolutionary Committee.

The Revolutionary Committee and the revolutionary masses further strengthened their ties through joint struggles, and the revolutionary and production situation of the whole county became better and better. A handful of class enemies saw that their plots to openly incite the masses to oppose the Revolutionary Committee could not succeed, so they changed their tactics and attempted to use sugar-coated bullets to corrupt the members of the Revolutionary Committee.

The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "There may be some Communists who have not been defeated by the enemy with guns, who are not unworthy of the title of heroes in front of these enemies; but they cannot withstand the attack of sugar-coated bullets. They will be defeated in front of sugar bullets." The responsible comrades of the People's Liberation Army Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team realized: A more intense and complex class struggle is underway. If victory is not achieved in this struggle, the newly born revolutionary power may be broken from within by the class enemies. With the help of the propaganda team, the Revolutionary Committee decided to organize all its members to go to the site of the Seventh Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Party—Xiangshan, to hold a Mao Zedong Thought study class.

The members of the Revolutionary Committee, with boundless love and loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, recited word by word Chairman Mao's report at the Seventh Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Party: "To win complete victory nationwide is only the first step in a journey of ten thousand li." "The Chinese revolution is great, but the road after the revolution is longer, the work is greater, and it is more arduous. This must be made clear to the Party now, and comrades must continue to maintain the style of modesty, prudence, no arrogance, and no impatience, and must continue to maintain the style of hard struggle."

Chairman Mao's great teachings made everyone clear-sighted. The representative of revolutionary cadres, Vice Chairman Gai Huxiang of the county Revolutionary Committee, recalled that when he first joined the revolution, he wholeheartedly followed Chairman Mao to make the revolution, but after the nationwide victory, he forgot Chairman Mao's teachings as his position grew, and he became estranged from the masses and made mistakes in this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. He said excitedly: "I have made countless mistakes in the past, the fundamental mistake is that I forgot Chairman Mao's teachings on linking up with the masses. In the future, I must learn from this painful lesson, be an ordinary laborer for life, be a servant of the people for life, and follow Chairman Mao to make the revolution for life." Some representatives of mass organizations also examined their own arrogance and self-satisfaction, taking pride in being flattered; they did not think there was any problem when the county radio station broadcasted their speeches; they did not stop their photos from being exhibited on the streets. They linked their own thoughts and styles with Chairman Mao's teachings and deeply felt: Chairman Mao's report before the nationwide victory is forever our alarm bell to prevent arrogance and impatience, and forever our guiding light.

The members of the Revolutionary Committee also used Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to criticize the bourgeois philosophy of life of the "officials doing the lord" of the Chinese Khrushchev, and carried out the "recall and compare" activity; recalling Chairman Mao's concern for the masses, deep involvement with the masses, and close ties with the masses, comparing their own attitudes towards the masses; recalling the revolutionary predecessors' unlimited loyalty to Chairman Mao, close ties with the masses, sharing weal and woe, comparing their own implementation of Chairman Mao's instructions. Through recalling and comparing, everyone further strengthened their revolutionary feelings of forever being loyal to Chairman Mao and forever being heart to heart with the masses. They said: The fine style of closely linking up with the masses cultivated by Chairman Mao personally for our Party is the fundamental style of our Party. If a revolutionary loses this style, his thoughts will change; if a revolutionary power loses this style, the power will change color. Everyone is determined to repel the class enemies' attack of sugar-coated bullets, to forever maintain the style of hard struggle, and not to leave the masses for a moment.

The Revolutionary Committee also formulated the "Several Regulations on Seriously Transforming Styles," making it clearer to establish the fine style of closely linking up with the masses as a fundamental construction of the Revolutionary Committee.

After a period of practice, the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team and the responsible comrades of the Revolutionary Committee found that some members of the Revolutionary Committee could not humbly accept the masses' criticisms. They studied and analyzed this phenomenon and believed: Not being able to humbly accept the masses' criticisms is essentially the same as liking others' flattery. They specially organized all members of the Revolutionary Committee to study Chairman Mao's teachings on criticism and self-criticism.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "We have the weapon of criticism and self-criticism of Marxism-Leninism. We can get rid of bad styles and maintain good styles." "Whether there is serious self-criticism is also one of the most distinctive features that distinguish us from other parties." Through study, everyone further realized that carrying out criticism and self-criticism is the only effective method to resist the infiltration of various political dust and political microorganisms, and is an effective weapon to smash the class enemies' attack of sugar-coated bullets. A revolutionary cadre must forever maintain revolutionary youth, never change quality, and must constantly absorb nutrition from the masses.

A representative of the revolutionary masses was originally a clerk of the county people's committee. After becoming a standing committee member of the county Revolutionary Committee, he had less and less contact with his comrades who had fought with him, and his life was also somewhat estranged from the revolutionary masses. Sometimes he even did not clean his own room. Comrades repeatedly criticized him, but he always emphasized objective reasons, thinking that these criticisms were "nitpicking." He studied Chairman Mao's teachings on criticism and self-criticism, and after having a heart-to-heart talk with the comrades of the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team, he finally realized his mistakes and immediately took the initiative to check his thoughts at a mass meeting. He said that he had been poisoned by the bourgeois ideology of the "officials doing the lord" of the Chinese Khrushchev, his position had changed, and his thoughts had also changed, forgetting that he was originally a servant of the people as a clerk, and now he was still a servant of the people as a standing committee member of the county Revolutionary Committee. From then on, he further strengthened his ties with the masses, studied Chairman Mao's works with the revolutionary masses, and fought against selfishness and criticized revisionism. He deeply felt: "The more one fights against selfishness, the closer one follows Chairman Mao; the deeper one criticizes revisionism, the closer one is to Chairman Mao." He picked up the broom he had thrown away and often swept the courtyard and tidied up the environmental sanitation. He said: "Chairman Mao's teachings and the revolutionary masses' criticisms have timely educated me, making me more determined to forever stand with the revolutionary masses." Other members of the Revolutionary Committee were also educated by this incident.

Since then, the Ping Shan County Revolutionary Committee has paid more attention to using various methods and opportunities to actively solicit and listen to the revolutionary masses' criticisms. Every time they convene or participate in mass meetings, they always specially set aside time to mobilize the masses to criticize the leadership. When they go deep into the masses, they always seriously solicit and listen to the masses' opinions at any time. The broad revolutionary masses, with the sentiment of cherishing and helping their own Revolutionary Committee, enthusiastically put forward criticisms and suggestions. For every criticism and suggestion from the masses, the Revolutionary Committee seriously studies, humbly accepts, and resolutely corrects them. The Ping Shan County Revolutionary Committee is thus inheriting and carrying forward the style of our Party's close ties with the masses, advancing bravely along the road of revolutionization, and leading the revolutionary people of the whole county to continuously achieve new victories in revolution and production.

    永远保持发扬党的三大革命传统作风
    依靠群众战胜敌人巩固胜利发展胜利
    平山县革委会在解放军帮助下，逐步建成革命的、有无产阶级权威的、朝气蓬勃的战斗指挥部
    河北省平山县西柏坡，在解放战争期间曾经是党中央的所在地，是党的七届二中全会的会址。二十年前在伟大领袖毛主席身边受到谆谆教诲的平山县广大革命群众，保持和发扬了过去的光荣传统，在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，向旧县委内一小撮走资派发动了猛烈的进攻，终于在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争中取得了决定性的胜利，于去年五月二十三日，成立了平山县革命委员会。
        最根本的一条就是联系群众
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“我们共产党人区别于其他任何政党的又一个显著的标志，就是和最广大的人民群众取得最密切的联系。”“国家机关的改革，最根本的一条，就是联系群众。”
    平山县革命委员会成立后，有的同志主张首先要“安摊子”，搞机关建设。驻平山县的解放军毛泽东思想宣传队负责人及时指出：机关建设要搞，但是不能呆在家里“安摊子”，重要的是要树立密切联系群众的优良作风。革委会首先用三天时间学习毛主席有关联系群众的教导，组织革委会成员到西柏坡革命历史纪念馆，参观了伟大领袖毛主席当年在西柏坡和广大贫下中农一起选稻种，一起插秧，一起收割稻子的伟大事迹，参观了毛主席亲手用过的镰刀。他们怀着激动的心情，表示一定要学习毛主席关于密切联系群众的光辉思想和伟大革命实践。他们立即背起背包，深入农村，同广大贫下中农一起，狠抓阶级斗争，以革命带动生产。哪里的阶级斗争复杂，哪里的问题多，哪里最艰苦，哪里最偏僻，他们就争着到哪里去。塔崖公社马路垴生产队地处山区，过去旧县委干部从来没有去过。县革委会常委刘桂生，遵照毛主席的教导，背着背包，翻山越岭，来到这个生产队蹲点。刚到生产队，他就放下背包，和农民一起劳动。他打听到谁家缺柴烧，就亲自上山打柴送去。他和广大贫下中农一起学习毛主席著作，一起批判中国赫鲁晓夫之流“三自一包”、“四大自由”等黑货，有力地促进了社员群众的思想革命化，推动了革命和生产的发展。去年秋季，这个生产队平均亩产量由前年的八百斤提高到一千多斤。
    革委会紧密联系群众的作风，受到了革命群众的热烈赞扬。贫下中农反映：“真是咱们的好领导，和咱们贫下中农心连心。”但是，一小撮阶级敌人却怕得要死，恨得要命。他们妄图破坏革委会和广大革命群众的密切联系，从去年六月初开始便到处制造谣言，污蔑革命三结合的革命委员会是“三凑合”，恶毒地挑起群众同革命委员会的对立。
    面对着一小撮阶级敌人的猖狂进攻，怎么办？他们认为：应把主要力量放到农村，深入群众，用战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装群众，带领群众开展对敌斗争。
    革委会成员下农村前，再次参观了西柏坡革命历史纪念馆，学习了毛主席有关密切联系群众的教导。他们说：我们的革命政权，是建立在全县三十三万革命人民的心坎里。新生的革命委员会，是全县革命群众在同阶级敌人的搏斗中诞生的，也要靠全县广大革命群众来爱护它、保卫它、巩固它、发展它。
    在解放军帮助下，革委会发动广大机关干部和革命的工人、农民、红卫兵小将，组织了万人毛泽东思想宣传队，由革委会负责同志分别带领，深入到全县五十二个公社、七百零八个大队，广泛深入地宣传毛主席一系列最新指示，用毛泽东思想武装群众，狠狠打击一小撮阶级敌人。在深山区的一个生产大队里，部分农民受坏人煽动，同革委会有对立情绪，县革委会主任李庆瑞便带领革委会成员，深入这个大队，同广大贫下中农一起学习毛泽东思想，同吃、同住、同劳动。广大贫下中农的阶级觉悟大大提高，很快揭破了阶级敌人的阴谋，增强了对县革委会的信任。
      务必继续保持艰苦奋斗的作风
    革命委员会和革命群众在共同斗争中，进一步密切了联系，全县革命和生产的形势越来越好。一小撮阶级敌人眼看公开挑动群众反对革委会的阴谋不能得逞，就改变了手法，企图用糖衣炮弹来腐蚀革委会的成员。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“可能有这样一些共产党人，他们是不曾被拿枪的敌人征服过的，他们在这些敌人面前不愧英雄的称号；但是经不起人们用糖衣裹着的炮弹的攻击，他们在糖弹面前要打败仗。”驻军毛泽东思想宣传队认识到：一场更激烈、更复杂的阶级斗争正在进行着。如果不在这一场斗争中取得胜利，新生的革命政权，就可能被阶级敌人从内部攻破。在宣传队帮助下，革委会决定组织全体成员到党的七届二中全会的会址——西柏坡，举办毛泽东思想学习班。
    革委会成员怀着对伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱、无限忠诚的无产阶级感情，一字一句地诵读了毛主席在党的七届二中全会上的报告：“夺取全国胜利，这只是万里长征走完了第一步。”“中国的革命是伟大的，但革命以后的路程更长，工作更伟大，更艰苦。这一点现在就必须向党内讲明白，务必使同志们继续地保持谦虚、谨慎、不骄、不躁的作风，务必使同志们继续地保持艰苦奋斗的作风。”
    毛主席的伟大教导，使大家心明眼亮。革命干部的代表、县革委会副主任盖虎祥，想起自己刚参加革命时，一心跟着毛主席干革命，可是在全国胜利后，“官”做大了，却忘记了毛主席的教导，和群众疏远了，在这次无产阶级文化大革命中犯了错误。他激动地说：“我过去千错万错，根本的错误就是忘记了毛主席联系群众的教导。今后一定要吸取这个沉痛的教训，当一辈子普通劳动者，做一辈子人民勤务员，跟着毛主席干一辈子革命。”一些群众组织的代表，也检查了自己骄傲自满、以功臣自居的情绪：听到人家捧场就沾沾自喜；县广播站播放自己的讲话录音，不觉得有什么问题；自己的照片在大街上展览，也不去加以阻止。他们联系自己的思想作风，学习毛主席的教导，深有所感地说：毛主席在全国胜利前夕的报告，永远是我们戒骄戒躁的警钟，永远是我们的指路明灯。
    革委会的成员还以毛泽东思想为武器，批判了中国赫鲁晓夫“当官做老爷”的资产阶级人生哲学，开展了忆比活动；忆毛主席关心群众、深入群众、密切联系群众的伟大革命实践，比自己对待群众的态度；忆革命前辈对毛主席无限忠诚、和群众息息相关、同甘共苦的优良传统，比自己对毛主席指示执行的情况。通过忆比，大家进一步增强了永远忠于毛主席、永远与群众心连心的革命感情。他们说：毛主席亲自培育的我们党的密切联系群众的优良作风，是我党的根本作风。一个革命者如果丢掉了这种作风，思想就要变质；一个革命政权如果丢掉了这种作风，政权就要变色。大家决心，一定要打退阶级敌人糖衣炮弹的进攻，永远保持艰苦奋斗的作风，一刻也不脱离群众。
    革委会还订出了《关于认真转变作风的几项规定》，更加明确地把树立密切联系群众的优良作风，作为革委会的一项最根本的建设。
      掌握批评和自我批评的武器
    经过一段实践以后，毛泽东思想宣传队和革委会负责同志，又发现少数革委会成员不能虚心听取群众的批评的现象。他们研究分析了这种现象后，认为：不能虚心听取群众的批评，与喜欢别人的奉承本质上是一样的。他们特意组织革委会全体成员学习了毛主席关于批评和自我批评的教导。
    毛主席教导我们：“我们有批评和自我批评这个马克思列宁主义的武器。我们能够去掉不良作风，保持优良作风。”“有无认真的自我批评，也是我们和其他政党互相区别的显著的标志之一。”通过学习，大家进一步认识到，开展批评和自我批评，是抵抗各种政治灰尘和政治微生物侵蚀的唯一有效的方法，是粉碎阶级敌人糖衣炮弹进攻的有效武器。一个革命干部要永远保持革命的青春，永不变质，就必须不断地从群众那里吸取营养。
    一个革命群众的代表，原来是县人委的公务员。在担任县革命委员会常委以后，他同原来与自己一起战斗的同志们接触越来越少了，生活上也与革命群众有些脱节了，有时甚至连自己的房间也不打扫了。同志们多次对他提出批评，他总强调客观原因，认为这些批评是“吹毛求疵”。他学习了毛主席关于批评和自我批评的教导，又经过和毛泽东思想宣传队的同志一起谈心，终于认识了自己的错误，立即主动在群众大会上检查了自己的思想。他说，自己中了中国赫鲁晓夫“当官做老爷”的资产阶级思想的毒，地位变了，思想也变了，忘记了过去当公务员是做人民的勤务员，今天担任县革委会常委仍然是人民的勤务员。从此，他进一步密切了和群众的联系，和革命群众一起学习毛主席著作，一起斗私批修。他深有体会地说：“斗私越狠，跟毛主席越紧，批修越深，对毛主席越亲。”他把丢掉的扫帚又拣了起来，经常打扫院子，整理环境卫生，他说：“毛主席的教导，革命群众的批评，及时教育了我，使我更坚定地永远与革命群众站在一起。”革委会的其他成员，也从这件事情中得到了教育。
    平山县革命委员会，从此更加注意采用各种方式和利用各种机会，主动地征求和听取革命群众的批评。每次召开或者参加群众性的会议，他们总要专门拿出时间发动群众对领导提出批评。在深入群众的时候，他们随时随地认真地征求和听取群众的意见。广大革命群众，也本着爱护和帮助自己的革命委员会的心情，热情地提出批评和建议。对于群众的每一点批评和建议，革委会都认真研究，虚心接受，坚决改正。平山县革命委员会就是这样继承和发扬我们党的紧密联系群众的作风，沿着革命化的大道奋勇前进，领导全县革命人民不断地夺取革命和生产的新胜利。　本报通讯员
