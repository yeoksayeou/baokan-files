The Tian Shan Mountains experienced a sudden flood, and the People's Liberation Army, without concern for their own tents, equipment, and backpacks, rushed to fight the flood. After they defeated the flood, they returned to their camp and found that their belongings had all been moved by the Red Guards.

The soldiers and officers of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army responded to Chairman Mao's call to "support the army and love the people" and held a political training camp in the Quitian Reclamation Area of the Junggar Basin.

One afternoon, a flood from the Tian Shan Mountains burst through the irrigation canals and rushed towards the Quitian power plant, cotton mill, and daily necessities warehouse. The tents set up by the troops along the roadsides were also in imminent danger of being submerged by the flood. Should they rush back to the camp to save their tents, equipment, and backpacks, or should they stay and fight the flood to protect the people's lives and property? The broad masses of soldiers and officers, who were in the factories and schools promoting Mao Zedong Thought and assisting in production, faced this choice. At this moment, they heard Chairman Mao's teachings: "Our army is completely for the liberation of the people, and it works thoroughly for the interests of the people." The great commander Chairman Mao's words were the order. The soldiers and officers, who were infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, immediately rushed towards the rolling flood. Soon after, the Red Guards and revolutionary masses from all directions gathered and fought alongside the Liberation Army. The revolutionary soldiers and masses armed with Mao Zedong Thought were fearless. They knew the waves could swallow people, but they rushed into the whirlpool. Soldier Zhang Yin of the Seventh Company fought against the waves and boulders in chest-deep floodwaters. For a moment, he lost his footing and was swept away by the water. After being rescued to the shore, his face was pale, and he vomited continuously. But after vomiting the dirty water, he shouted, "With determination, fearing no sacrifice, overcoming all difficulties, and striving for victory," and rushed back into the raging current. Where it was most dangerous, there were the Liberation Army soldiers; where there were the Liberation Army soldiers, there were the Red Guards. Sixteen-year-old female Red Guard Qi Wei Dong was hit by the waves and swallowed a few mouthfuls of water. The soldiers sent her to the shore, and she shouted, "Learn from the Liberation Army!" and jumped back into the water to fill sandbags. The night grew darker, the water colder, and the battle more intense. The soldiers displayed the spirit of continuous combat. After plugging one breach, they rushed to block another. After seven hours of heroic struggle, they finally defeated the flood and ensured the safety of the people's lives and property.

Deep into the night, the soldiers and officers who fought the flood returned to their camp and found that their tents, backpacks, and equipment were all neatly placed in the classrooms of Quitian First Middle School. What had happened? When everyone saw the Red Guards, whose clothes were soaked, they understood. It turned out that when the troops were fighting the flood, the water also rushed towards their camp. The few soldiers left behind were busy. At this time, the Red Guards from the nearby Quitian First Middle School rushed to the scene upon hearing the news. After several hours of battle, they successfully saved all the belongings. The Red Guards remembered Chairman Mao's teachings, "Never forget class struggle," and maintained high vigilance. Each classroom had someone on guard to prevent sabotage by bad elements.

"When the army and the people unite as one, who in the world can defeat them?" The People's Liberation Army and the Red Guards, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, united and fought together, defeated the flood, and protected the lives and property of the state and the people, singing a moving song of "supporting the army and loving the people."

    天山脚下鱼水情
    天山洪水暴发，解放军不顾抢救自己的帐篷、器材和背包，奋起抗洪。他们战胜了洪水以后，回到驻地，发现自己的东西都被红卫兵小将帮助转移了。
    人民解放军某部的指战员，响应毛主席“拥军爱民”的伟大号召，在准噶尔盆地的奎屯垦区举办政治野营。
    一天下午，天山上的洪水暴发，冲破干渠，向奎屯发电厂、棉纺厂和日用百货仓库奔腾而来。搭在公路两旁林荫道上的部队的帐篷，也有马上被洪水浸没的危险。是赶回驻地抢救帐篷、器材和背包，还是就地抗洪，保护国家和人民的生命财产呢？正在下厂、进校宣传毛泽东思想和助民生产的广大指战员，面临着这样的选择。这时他们耳边响起了毛主席的教导：“我们这个队伍完全是为着解放人民的，是彻底地为人民的利益工作的。”伟大统帅毛主席的声音就是命令。无限忠于毛主席的指战员们，立即迎着滚滚而来的洪水猛扑上去。紧跟着，红卫兵小将和革命群众，也从四面八方汇集拢来，同解放军一起战斗。用毛泽东思想武装起来的革命战士和革命群众，天不怕，地不怕，他们明知浪吞人，偏向漩涡冲。七连战士张印，在齐胸的洪水中和恶浪、巨石搏斗，一时站立不稳，被水冲走了。被救上岸后，脸色惨白，呕吐不止。但当他吐完污水后，就高喊着
  “下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”，又冲进了激流。那里最危险，那里就有解放军；那里有解放军，那里就有红卫兵。十六岁的女红卫兵齐卫东，在风浪冲击下喝了几口水。战士们把她送到岸上，她一边喊着“向解放军学习！”一边又跳进水里装沙袋。天越来越黑，水越来越冷，战斗越来越激烈。战士们发扬连续作战的精神，这个决口堵住了，又去挡另一个决口。经过七个小时的英勇奋战，终于战胜了洪水，保证了人民的生命财产不受损失。
    夜深了，抗洪的指战员们陆续回到驻地时，发现部队的帐篷、背包和器材都已完整地放在奎屯第一中学的教室里了。这是怎么回事呢？当大家看到个个衣服湿透的红卫兵小将时，心里都明白了。原来，当部队同志在抗洪抢险的时候，洪水也开始向驻地奔泻而来，少数留守营房的战士都忙开了。这时，附近奎屯第一中学的红卫兵小将闻讯赶来。他们经过几个小时的战斗，终于把东西全部抢救出来。小将们牢记毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的教导，保持高度的警惕，每个教室里都有专人看守，防止坏人破坏。
    “军民团结如一人，试看天下谁能敌”。用毛泽东思想武装起来的人民解放军和红卫兵小将团结战斗，战胜了洪水，保住了国家和人民的生命财产，奏出了一曲动人的“拥军爱民”的凯歌。
