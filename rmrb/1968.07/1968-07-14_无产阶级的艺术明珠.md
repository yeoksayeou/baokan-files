In the triumphant songs of the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, in the realm of proletarian arts, another flower blooming with the radiance of Mao Zedong Thought has emerged—the piano-accompanied version of "The Red Lantern"! Its birth once again demonstrates the fruits of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the world; it opens up a new path for Western instruments and symphonies, and a new path for the accompaniment of our great motherland's dramas. This is a great victory for Chairman Mao's guidelines on arts serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and on "using foreign things for Chinese purposes and innovating." We enthusiastically acclaim: Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand times ten thousand years! The piano-accompanied "The Red Lantern" is a proletarian artistic gem created under the personal cultivation and guidance of Comrade Jiang Qing. With reverence, we learn from Comrade Jiang Qing!

The piano-accompanied "The Red Lantern" is a product of the revolutionary criticism of the counter-revolutionary revisionist artistic black line. It is a brilliant achievement obtained by revolutionary artists who, in the face of the great victories of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, dared to break conventions, dared to think, dared to act, and dared to revolutionize. When this new form of proletarian revolutionary art, the piano-accompanied "The Red Lantern," was born, we cannot help but think of how our beloved Comrade Jiang Qing braved all obstacles, charged into the fray, dispelled the mist, and crossed the rapids, destroying the counter-revolutionary revisionist artistic black line. She drove the ghosts and snakes off the stage with eight brilliant revolutionary model operas, establishing a new era for proletarian arts.

The revolution in Peking opera music is an important part of the Peking opera revolution. The class struggle in the realm of Peking opera music is as sharp and complex as the class struggle on the path of Peking opera revolution. As early as 1964, Comrade Jiang Qing, following Chairman Mao's instructions to "use the past to serve the present and foreign things to serve China," proposed that the piano should accompany revolutionary modern Peking opera. However, a small clique of counter-revolutionary revisionists who had usurped the leadership of the arts blocked this important instruction, preventing it from reaching revolutionary artists. In 1964, Comrade Jiang Qing instructed our troupe to use music to shape the heroic image of New Fourth Army political commissar Guo Jianhua. She also proposed that the orchestra should include Western instruments such as the bassoon, double bass, and cello, among others. Comrade Jiang Qing emphasized the use of music to distinguish between positive and negative characters. When we revolutionary artists actively implemented Comrade Jiang Qing's instructions, we encountered sabotage and obstruction from a small clique of counter-revolutionary revisionists and reactionary "authorities" in the arts. They blathered on about how "this would turn into film music, making it too noisy" and how "Chinese opera music is neutral and does not harmonize with Western instruments," and other such nonsense. The successful creation of the symphony "Sha Jianhu" and the piano-accompanied "The Red Lantern" has refuted the shameless lies of that reactionary bunch. Countless facts in the arts tell us this truth: proletarian revolutionary arts always grow and flourish in the struggle between two classes, two roads, and two lines.

From the piano-accompanied "The Red Lantern," we see the unity of revolutionary political content and perfect artistic form. Under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, piano art has been reborn, displaying immense power and showing boundless prospects for development. It successfully integrates piano music, Peking opera singing, and Peking opera percussion into a harmonious whole. It retains the characteristics of Peking opera singing, such as being high-pitched, passionate, upright, and clear, with distinct rhythms. It also fully utilizes the piano's wide range, powerful momentum, and expressive qualities. It not only accompanies the performers but also sets the background and atmosphere. Therefore, the piano-accompanied "The Red Lantern" promotes both Peking opera singing and piano art, greatly enriching the musical images of the characters in "The Red Lantern."

In the segment where Li Tie Mei sings "After listening to Grandma talk about the red lantern," the transition after the line "Why did they do it?" is carefully designed and has a great effect. The piano plays a segment representing Li Tie Mei's inner monologue, portraying the character with great subtlety. It reveals the inner workings of a revolutionary successor growing up in a revolutionary family, extending and expanding the character's thoughts and emotions, as if telling the audience that Tie Mei's questions have been understood. Immediately following this, the piano uses a strong and urgent rhythm to express the character's fluctuating emotions. At this point, the performer sings, "To save China and the poor, to defeat the enemy soldiers." Here, the piano highlights Tie Mei's ambition to become a revolutionary successor. Finally, when singing "Tie Mei, you should take up the eight hundred pounds," the piano uses a powerful momentum to enhance Tie Mei's confidence and revolutionary spirit as she grows through struggle.

In the "Execution Ground" scene, the piano's capabilities are fully utilized, and the musical image is very rich. After Li Yuhe walks onto the execution ground and finishes singing "Stepping out of prison," the piano accompaniment plays a soaring and majestic tune, creating a strong atmosphere. Before the long segment of singing begins, the piano performance has already set the stage for Li Yuhe's heroic image. When the singing continues with "Don't look at me in shackles and chains, locking my feet and hands, but not my heroic spirit that soars to the heavens," the piano uses a strong rhythm to enhance the singing's power, breaking through the original artistic techniques of Peking opera music. It expresses Li Yuhe's unyielding spirit, righteousness, and heroic demeanor, even when imprisoned. When singing "Marching to the execution ground, head held high, looking far ahead," the piano performance expands and develops the melody and rhythm, further expressing the hero's broad vision and the bright prospects of revolutionary victory. This transition is both bold and does not depart from the original characteristics of Peking opera singing. We then hear "At that time, red flags were planted all over China, thinking of this, my confidence and fighting spirit are even stronger" with the performer's singing and the piano's powerful influence, the audience is deeply moved by the musical image expressing the heroic character's revolutionary optimism, noble character, and steadfast spirit. In the postlude of this segment, the character's image is further enhanced, with the repeated development of Li Yuhe's musical theme on the piano keys, creating a surging, overwhelming momentum, expressing the hero's great revolutionary passion. At this moment, the towering image of a communist warrior stands before the audience.

We feel that piano art has unique advantages in setting the environment and creating an atmosphere. It can bring the character's inner world to life through musical images. This also inspires the performer's imagination and passion, better expressing the character's thoughts and emotions. Additionally, the prelude of piano accompaniment can set the character's mood and environment. Before the performer sings, the musical image of the piano performance has already influenced the audience, greatly aiding in the creation of the character's musical image. The postlude can expand the thoughts and emotions expressed in the Peking opera singing, making them thorough and rich, greatly enriching the character's image. These characteristics of piano accompaniment have a significant inspirational and promotional effect on the creation of revolutionary Peking opera music.

The birth of this new form of revolutionary art, the piano-accompanied "The Red Lantern," is a victory for Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary artistic line. It is a new contribution to proletarian revolutionary arts made by the revolutionary comrades of the Central Orchestra and the China Peking Opera Troupe, under the leadership of our beloved Comrade Jiang Qing, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought. Their experience once again tells us: with a heart full of loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, arming our minds with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, carrying out ideological revolutionization, always following the strategic deployment of the great leader Chairman Mao, and resolutely implementing Comrade Jiang Qing's instructions, we can sail ten thousand miles without changing course, overcome any difficulties, and create miracles that previous generations dared not even imagine.

The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "Humanity must constantly summarize experiences, make discoveries, inventions, creations, and progress." We will definitely follow the affectionate teachings of the great teacher Chairman Mao, taking Comrade Jiang Qing as our shining example, with an unyielding revolutionary spirit, seriously treating our artistic practice, striving to learn new things, and pursuing excellence in Peking opera performance art. We are determined, under the personal leadership of Comrade Jiang Qing, to continuously propagate Mao Zedong Thought, defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary artistic line, read Chairman Mao's books for a lifetime, walk the revolutionary path for a lifetime, perform revolutionary modern operas for a lifetime, and contribute all our strength to the revolution of Peking opera, achieving new merits for the development of proletarian revolutionary arts.

    无产阶级的艺术明珠
    北京京剧团　谭元寿　马长礼
    在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的凯歌声中，在无产阶级文艺园地里，又一朵闪烁着毛泽东思想光辉的鲜花——钢琴伴唱《红灯记》创作出来了！它的诞生，再一次向世界人民显示了无产阶级文化大革命的成果；为西洋乐器和交响乐开辟了一条新的道路，为我们伟大祖国的戏剧伴奏开辟了一条新的道路。这是伟大领袖毛主席关于文艺为工农兵服务和“洋为中用、推陈出新”的文艺方针的伟大胜利。我们最最热烈地欢呼：毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！钢琴伴唱《红灯记》，是江青同志亲自培育和指导下创作的无产阶级艺术明珠。我们怀着崇敬的心情，向江青同志学习！
    钢琴伴唱《红灯记》，是对反革命修正主义文艺黑线进行革命大批判的产物，是在无产阶级文化大革命节节胜利的大好形势下，革命文艺战士们发挥大无畏的革命首创精神，破除迷信，敢想、敢干、敢革命所取得的光辉战果。在钢琴伴唱《红灯记》这一无产阶级革命文艺新品种诞生的时候，我们不禁想到我们敬爱的江青同志如何披荆斩棘，冲锋陷阵，驱迷雾，越险滩，摧毁了反革命修正主义文艺黑线，并以八个光辉灿烂的革命样板戏把牛鬼蛇神赶下舞台，打出了无产阶级文艺的新天下。
    京剧音乐革命是京剧革命的一个重要组成部分，京剧音乐领域中的阶级斗争同京剧革命道路上的阶级斗争一样，也是异常尖锐复杂的。早在一九六四年，江青同志根据毛主席古为今用，洋为中用的指示，提出钢琴要为革命现代京剧伴唱。但是窃取文艺界领导权的一小撮反革命修正主义分子却横加封锁，使这一重要指示迟迟不能和革命文艺战士见面。江青同志在一九六四年指示我团要用音乐塑造出新四军指导员郭建光的英雄形象。并提出乐队要增加西洋乐器，如“巴松”、“贝司”和大提琴等等。江青同志强调要用音乐来区分正反面人物。当我们广大革命文艺战士积极贯彻江青同志这一指示时，却遭到了一小撮反革命修正主义分子和反动艺术“权威”的破坏和阻挠。他们胡说什么：“这样就成了电影音乐，这多闹得慌。”还有人叫嚣：“中国戏曲音乐是中性的，配上西洋乐器不协调”等一派胡言乱语。交响音乐《沙家浜》和钢琴伴唱《红灯记》的创作成功，有力地批驳了那一伙反动分子的无耻谰言。文艺界无数事实告诉我们这样一个真理：无产阶级革命文艺总是在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争中成长壮大的。
    从钢琴伴唱《红灯记》中，我们看到了革命的政治内容和完美的艺术形式的统一。在毛泽东思想统帅下，钢琴艺术获得了新生，发挥了巨大的威力，并显示出无限广阔的发展前途。它成功地把钢琴音乐、京剧唱腔和京剧打击乐融合在一起，成为一个浑然统一的整体。它既保留了京剧唱腔高亢、激越、挺拔、爽朗、节奏鲜明等特点，又充分发挥了钢琴音域广阔、气势磅礴、富有表现力的特色。它不仅能为演员伴唱，而且能烘托背景和气氛。因此钢琴伴唱《红灯记》使京剧演唱和钢琴艺术相互促进，大大丰富了《红灯记》人物的音乐形象。
    在李铁梅唱的“听罢奶奶说红灯”这一段中，“他们到底为什么”一句后的过门是经过精心设计的，效果极好。钢琴弹奏的一段表现李铁梅内心独白式的曲调，刻划人物非常细腻，显现出一个在革命家庭中成长起来的革命接班人内心的活动，它使人物的思想感情得到进一步延续和扩展，仿佛告诉听众铁梅提出来的问题已经得到了理解。紧跟着钢琴又以强烈急遽的节奏，表现了人物思想感情的起伏变化，这时演员唱出了“为的是救中国救穷人，打败鬼子兵”。这里钢琴又突出地刻划出铁梅要做革命接班人的雄心壮志。最后唱到“铁梅你该挑起八百斤”时，钢琴又以磅礴的气势来烘托铁梅在战斗成长过程中充满信心的革命豪情。
    “刑场”一场，充分发挥了钢琴的性能，音乐形象非常饱满。在李玉和走上刑场，唱完了“迈步出监”时，紧跟着唱腔的尾声，钢琴伴奏出激越雄伟的曲调，造出强烈的气氛，在下面大段唱词演唱之前，钢琴演奏已经烘托出李玉和的英雄形象。当接着唱出“休看我戴铁镣裹铁链，锁住我双脚和双手，锁不住我雄心壮志冲云天”时，钢琴又用了强烈的节奏，加强了唱腔的力度，突破了京剧音乐原有的艺术手法，表现出李玉和身在牢房，胸怀天下，威武不屈，大义凛然的英雄气概。当唱到“赴刑场、气昂昂抬头远看”时，后面的过门，钢琴演奏从旋律、节奏上加以扩充发展，进一步表现出了英雄人物高瞻远瞩的博大胸怀，预见到革命胜利的光辉前景。这段过门既有大胆的突破，但又没有离开京剧唱腔原有过门的特点。我们紧跟着听到“那时候全中国红旗插遍，想到此信心增斗志更坚”这句唱词时，由于演员的演唱和钢琴伴唱的强烈感染，听众深深地为音乐形象表现出来的英雄人物的革命乐观主义精神、高尚的襟怀与坚贞的气节所感动。在这一段的伴唱的后奏里又进一步烘托人物形象，以李玉和音乐主题的反复发展，在钢琴的键盘上掀起了汹涌澎湃、排山倒海的气势，抒发了英雄人物的伟大的革命激情，这时共产主义战士顶天立地的高大形象矗立在听众的面前。
    我们感到钢琴艺术在烘托环境、制造气氛方面确实有独到之处，它能够把人物的内心世界通过音乐形象再现出来。这样也会唤起演员的想象和激情，更好地抒发人物的思想感情。还有，钢琴伴唱的前奏可以把人物的心情和环境烘托出来，在演员演唱之前，钢琴演奏的音乐形象已经感染了听众，大大有助于人物音乐形象的塑造。而后奏又能扩展京剧唱腔中所表现的人物思想感情，使之淋漓尽致，大大丰富了人物的形象。钢琴伴唱的这些特点，对革命京剧音乐的创作，有着很大的启发和促进作用。
    钢琴伴唱《红灯记》这一革命文艺新品种的诞生，是毛主席的无产阶级革命文艺路线的胜利，是中央乐团、中国京剧团革命战友，在我们敬爱的江青同志率领下，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，为无产阶级革命文艺作出的新贡献。他们的经验再次告诉我们：对伟大领袖毛主席心怀一个“忠”字，用战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装自己的头脑，搞好思想革命化，时刻紧跟伟大领袖毛主席的战略部署，坚决执行江青同志的指示，我们就能万里行船不转向，天大的困难能克服，就能创造出前人想都不敢想的人间奇迹来。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“人类总得不断地总结经验，有所发现，有所发明，有所创造，有所前进。”我们一定遵循伟大导师毛主席的亲切教导，以江青同志为光辉榜样，用不断革命的精神，严肃地对待我们的艺术实践，努力学习新生事物，在京剧表演艺术上精益求精。我们决心在江青同志亲自率领下，不断宣传毛泽东思想，捍卫毛主席的革命文艺路线，读一辈子毛主席的书，走一辈子革命的路，演一辈子革命现代戏，为京剧革命贡献出我们全部的力量，为发展无产阶级革命文艺立新功。
