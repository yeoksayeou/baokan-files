In the main part of Indonesia—Java Island, the people's guerrilla fighters active in the rural and mountainous areas of the east, center, and west, with the great assistance and enthusiastic support of the broad masses of people, especially the peasantry, are raising the banner of armed revolution, overcoming numerous difficulties and obstacles, and pushing the wheel of people's revolution forward.

In recent times, news about the people's armed struggle has broken through the heavy news blockade of the Suharto-Nasution fascist military regime and continuously emerged from East Java. The flames of people's armed revolution have spread across the vast rural areas of the south, west, and north of East Java. Recently, the commander of the East Java Military Region under the Suharto-Nasution fascist military regime, Yasin, admitted in a speech: Since the beginning of this year, the people's armed revolution in East Java has carried out "many, many" guerrilla activities. The people's armed revolution "often attacks" the reactionary military's patrol teams. These excellent sons and daughters of the Indonesian people have used "guerrilla tactics" in their struggle. They "built underground hiding places" and "covered the entrances with bamboo groves," making it impossible for the reactionary military to find their tracks.

The flames of people's armed revolution have also spread across many mountainous areas of Central Java. The chief of staff of the Central Java Military Region under the Suharto-Nasution fascist military regime, Widodo, recently revealed in a speech: The people's armed revolution in Central Java is "being carried out in the various mountainous areas west of Surakarta." These mountainous areas are "well-known Communist strongholds." Another reactionary military officer in Central Java admitted with fear: The revolutionary people of Central Java have used "various very strict and clever methods" in their struggle. They have adopted the strategy of "surrounding the cities from the countryside" and "using the countryside as a base." The reactionary newspaper in Jakarta, *Berita Yudha*, revealed: The people's armed revolution in Central Java "continues to operate" even when marching or working in the fields. They are "tenacious and resolute" in their struggle. The Antara News Agency revealed: The people's armed forces in Central Java have also opened schools in their operational areas to provide political and military training to revolutionary fighters.

According to reports, the people's armed revolution active in various parts of Java Island has received strong support from people of all walks of life, especially the peasantry. The head of the reactionary military in East Java, Yasin, admitted: In the southern region of East Java, "more than ninety percent of the people support the guerrillas." Reactionary military personnel in Central Java also admitted: The people's armed revolution enjoys the enthusiastic support of the people of Central Java. The people use various methods to support the people's armed revolution; even some patriotic soldiers within the reactionary military use various conditions to provide assistance to the people's armed revolution.

Java Island is the main part of the Indonesian archipelago, with more than sixty-five percent of Indonesia's population of over one hundred million living on Java Island. This island has always been the center of revolutionary and counter-revolutionary struggles in Indonesia, and the people have a long tradition of revolutionary struggle. As early as 1926, the people of Java Island, first and foremost the peasantry of West Java, under the leadership of the Indonesian Communist Party, launched an armed uprising against Dutch colonial rule. In 1948, the Indonesian reactionaries carried out a bloody armed suppression of the revolutionary people, and the people of this island put up a heroic armed resistance. After the Suharto-Nasution fascist military clique launched a counter-revolutionary military coup in October 1965, the massacre of Indonesian Communist Party members and revolutionary people was mainly carried out on Java Island and its neighboring islands. The revolutionary people of Java Island and the Suharto-Nasution fascist military regime have a blood debt that cannot be reconciled. They are determined, together with the people of the entire country, to use revolutionary armed struggle to bury the Suharto-Nasution fascist military regime, which has blood on its hands, and to build a new Indonesia of people's democracy.

    高举武装革命大旗  克服无数艰难险阻
    印尼革命武装斗争烽火燃遍爪哇岛
    人民革命武装受到广大农民的拥护和支援
    新华社二十二日讯　在印度尼西亚的主要部分——爪哇岛上，活跃在东部、中部和西部的农村和山区的人民游击战士，在广大人民特别是农民群众的大力援助和热情支持下，正高举武装革命大旗，克服重重艰难险阻，把人民革命的车轮向前推进。
    最近一个时期，有关革命人民武装斗争的消息，穿过苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯军人政权的重重新闻封锁，不断从东爪哇传出。人民武装革命的烽火燃遍了东爪哇的南部、西部和北部的广大农村地区。苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯军人政权的东爪哇军区司令雅辛最近在一篇讲话中承认：今年上半年以来，东爪哇人民革命武装进行了“许许多多”的游击活动。人民革命武装“经常袭击”反动军队的巡逻队。这些印尼人民的优秀儿女在斗争中“采用了游击战的策略”，他们“建筑地下隐藏所”，并且“用竹林掩盖进口处”，使反动军队无法找寻他们的踪迹。
    人民革命武装斗争的烽火也烧遍了中爪哇的许多山区。苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯军人政权的中爪哇军区参谋长维多多最近在一篇讲话中透露：中爪哇人民的革命武装斗争“正在梭罗以西的各个山区里进行”，这些山区，是“人所周知的共产党据点”。中爪哇另一反动军官带着恐惧的心情承认：中爪哇革命人民在斗争中“使用了各种非常严密和高明的手段”；他们采用了“农村包围城市的战略”，“把农村作为根据地”。雅加达反动报纸《战斗报》透露：中爪哇人民革命武装“即使在行军或在田间锄地时”，“都在不断地展开活动”。他们在斗争中“顽强而坚定”。安塔拉通讯社透露：中爪哇人民武装还在自己活动的区域里开办了学校，对革命战士进行政治和军事训练。
    据报道，在爪哇岛各地活动的人民革命武装，得到了各界人民特别是农民群众的大力支援。东爪哇反动军队的头目雅辛承认：在东爪哇南部地区，“百分之九十以上的人民支持游击队”。中爪哇的反动军人也承认：人民革命武装受到中爪哇人民的热情拥护。人民采用各种方式支持人民革命武装；甚至反动军队内部的一些爱国官兵，也利用各种条件，给人民革命武装提供帮助。
    爪哇岛是印度尼西亚群岛的主要部分，印尼一亿多人口的百分之六十五以上，居住在爪哇岛上。这个岛一直是印尼革命和反革命斗争的中心地区，人民具有长期的革命斗争传统。早在一九二六年，爪哇岛的人民群众，首先是西爪哇的农民群众，就在印尼共产党的领导下，举行过反对荷兰殖民统治的武装起义。一九四八年，印尼反动派对革命人民进行血腥的武装镇压，这个岛的人民群众，曾经进行过英勇的武装反抗。苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯军人集团一九六五年十月发动反革命军事政变后，对印尼共产党人和革命人民的大屠杀，主要是在爪哇岛及其邻近岛屿上进行的。爪哇岛的革命人民和苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯军人政权，有着不共戴天的血海深仇。他们决心同全国人民一道，用革命的武装斗争，埋葬双手沾满人民鲜血的苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯军人政权，打出一个人民民主的新印尼。
