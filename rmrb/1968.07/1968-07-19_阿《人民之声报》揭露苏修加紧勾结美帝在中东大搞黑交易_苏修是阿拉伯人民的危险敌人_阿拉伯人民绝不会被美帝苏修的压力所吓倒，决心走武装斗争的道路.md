The People's Voice of Albania has exposed the Soviet revisionists' intensified collusion with the U.S. imperialists in the Middle East, engaging in shady deals. The Soviet revisionists are a dangerous enemy of the Arab people. The Arab people will not be intimidated by the pressure from the U.S. imperialists and the Soviet revisionists; they are determined to take the path of armed struggle.

	NEW DELHI, July 18 (Xinhua) — The People's Voice of Albania published an editorial on July 17 titled "The Khrushchev Revisionists Are a Dangerous Enemy of the Peoples of the Arab Countries." The editorial strongly condemns the treacherous acts of the Soviet revisionist clique in intensifying their collusion with the U.S. imperialists in the Middle East, betraying the national interests of the Arab people.

	The article states: Recently, the Soviet revisionists have been making concerted efforts to bring the Arab peoples and the entire Middle East region under the hegemony of U.S.-Soviet domination. The current policy of the Khrushchev revisionists towards the Arab countries is coordinated with the policy pursued by the U.S. imperialists towards these countries. The aim is to ensure that the developments following Israel's open aggression against the United Arab Republic, Jordan, and Syria serve the interests of maintaining the political hegemony of the two superpowers in this region.

	The article points out: The economic and military "aid" provided by Moscow to the Arab countries is merely a cover used by the revisionist leaders to conceal their shameful betrayal of the Arab cause and their close criminal cooperation with the instigators of aggression.

	The article says: Due to the Soviet revisionists' stubborn adherence to their anti-Arab and pro-imperialist policies, they insist on advocating "political solutions" and exert pressure on the Arab countries to make "concessions," recognize the reality of Israel, and abandon the struggle for liberation. The Soviet leaders recently also discussed with the UN "envoy" Jarring the so-called "principles" for establishing peace in the Middle East. One of the leaders of the Soviet revisionist clique, Kosygin, on July 1 also proposed a so-called "special suggestion" for stopping the arms race and disarmament in the Middle East. This suggestion is something that the U.S. imperialist leader Johnson proposed a year ago. But the peoples of the Arab countries, through their extremely painful experiences, have come to believe that the slogan of "stopping the arms race and disarmament" aims to sabotage the anti-imperialist struggle of the Arab peoples and obstruct and suppress the liberation movements of the Arab peoples.

	The article points out: It is precisely when the U.S. imperialists, including the "Hawk" missiles, are using the latest weapons to slaughter the peoples of the Arab countries, the imperialist product Israel, that the Soviet revisionist leader Kosygin talks about the so-called "stopping the arms race and disarmament" and acts behind the scenes, urging the Arab peoples to disarm in the face of the Israeli aggressors. This is the Soviet revisionists' open betrayal of the Arab people, their open pro-imperialist and pro-Israeli stance. However, the peoples of the Arab countries have now heightened their revolutionary political awareness against imperialism, strengthened their fighting unity, and identified their enemies and friends. They will not be intimidated by the pressure, extortion, and deception of U.S. imperialism and the Soviet revisionists. The armed guerrilla warfare in Palestine and the occupied lands has proven this. Today, the peoples of the Arab countries are determined to take the path of armed liberation struggle.

	The article concludes: The Albanian people believe that the just cause of the Arab people will achieve victory through their resolute struggle to defend their freedom and sovereignty. The combined conspiracy of U.S. imperialism, Zionism, and the false friends of the Arab people, the Soviet revisionists and the Tito revisionists, will suffer a shameful defeat in the face of the determination of the brotherly Arab peoples to take up arms and defend the freedom, sovereignty, national dignity, and territorial integrity of their countries.

    阿《人民之声报》揭露苏修加紧勾结美帝在中东大搞黑交易
    苏修是阿拉伯人民的危险敌人
    阿拉伯人民绝不会被美帝苏修的压力所吓倒，决心走武装斗争的道路
    新华社地拉那十八日电　阿尔巴尼亚《人民之声报》十七日发表题为《赫鲁晓夫修正主义者是阿拉伯各国人民危险的敌人》的编辑部文章，强烈谴责苏修叛徒集团加紧同美帝在中东大搞黑交易，出卖阿拉伯人民民族利益的可耻罪行。
    文章说：最近，苏修加紧努力企图把阿拉伯各国人民和整个中东地区纳入美苏霸权的轨道。赫鲁晓夫修正主义者目前对阿拉伯国家的政策是同美帝所推行的对这些国家的政策相协调的，其目的是使以色列对阿联、约旦和叙利亚发动公开侵略后的事态发展，都服从于保障美苏两大国在这一地区的政治霸权的利益。
    文章指出：莫斯科向阿拉伯国家提供的经济和军事“援助”，都是修正主义头子用来掩盖他们和盘出卖阿拉伯事业和同侵略的唆使者进行紧密的罪恶合作的“遮羞布”。
    文章说：由于苏修顽固不化地推行反阿拉伯和亲帝的方针，他们就坚持主张“政治解决”，并对阿拉伯国家进行讹诈和施加种种压力，要阿拉伯国家作出“让步”，承认以色列的现实，放弃解放斗争。苏修头子不久前还同联合国“特使”雅林讨论所谓关于建立中东和平的“准则”。苏修集团头子之一柯西金七月一日还提出一项所谓在中东“停止军备竞赛和裁军”的“特别建议”。这个建议是美帝头子约翰逊一年前就抛出来的东西。但阿拉伯各国人民通过极其痛苦的经验相信，所谓“停止军备竞赛和裁军”的口号，目的在于破坏阿拉伯各国人民的反美斗争，阻挠和镇压阿拉伯各国人民的解放运动。
    文章指出：正是在美帝国主义者用包括“隼式”导弹在内的最新武器豢养屠杀阿拉伯各国人民的帝国主义的产物以色列的时候，苏修头目柯西金竟侈谈所谓“停止军备竞赛和裁军”，并在幕后活动，要阿拉伯各国人民在以色列侵略者面前解除武装。这是苏修公开叛卖阿拉伯人民，公开亲帝和亲以色列的立场。但是现在阿拉伯各国人民提高了自己反帝的革命政治觉悟，增强了自己的战斗团结，认清了敌人和朋友。他们绝不为美帝国主义和苏修的压力、讹诈和欺骗所吓倒。在巴勒斯坦和被侵占的土地上的武装游击战争，证明了这一点。今天，阿拉伯各国人民决心走武装解放斗争的道路。
    文章最后说：阿尔巴尼亚人民相信，阿拉伯人民的正义事业将通过为保卫他们的自由和主权的坚决斗争的道路而取得胜利。美帝和犹太复国主义者以及阿拉伯人民的假朋友苏修和铁托修正主义者的联合阴谋，在兄弟的阿拉伯各国人民手拿武器，保卫他们国家的自由、主权、民族尊严和领土完整的决心面前，必将遭到可耻的失败。
