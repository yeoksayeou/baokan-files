Our brigade has an impoverished peasant named Wang Guirong. She is an elderly woman with bound feet. Her family of nine, including three generations, relies on her for cooking and washing clothes. During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, she studied Chairman Mao's works, severely criticized the fallacy of "work points in command," and her ideological awareness greatly improved. She thought: In the old society, our family was destroyed, we suffered from cold and hunger, and lived a life worse than cattle. It was Chairman Mao who saved her from the sea of suffering. Chairman Mao is the great savior, without Chairman Mao, there would be no Wang Guirong. Therefore, she resolutely responded to Chairman Mao's call to "grasp revolution, promote production" and decided to contribute her strength to the collective. She braved the biting cold wind and, in temperatures as low as minus sixteen degrees, worked alongside young and strong brigade members to build dikes and fill ditches. Her hands were blistered and cracked, but she did not rest. Someone advised her not to work, but she firmly replied: "What's the cold? In the past, in such cold weather, we still had to beg for food! Today, we are responding to Chairman Mao's call to build dikes and fill ditches. No matter how cold the weather, I am willing to do it."

Inspired by Wang Guirong, several other elderly women, including Lü Xiulan, Kong Qinglan, and Wang Shuqin, also braved the cold and hardship to participate in building dikes and filling ditches. They also used their rest time to perform for everyone, spreading the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. They did many good deeds and never asked for work points. They always thought of Chairman Mao and worked for the collective, never being distracted by work points.

    一心想着毛主席
    一心一意为集体
    我们大队有个贫农社员叫王桂荣，她是个半小脚的老大娘。全家祖孙九口人，做饭洗衣，家务事全由她干。文化大革命运动中，她学习了毛主席著作，狠批了“工分挂帅”谬论，思想觉悟大大提高。她想到：在旧社会，家破人亡，挨冻受饿，过着牛马不如的生活。是毛主席把她从苦海里救了出来。毛主席是大救星，没有毛主席，就没有王桂荣。于是，她坚决响应毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，要为集体生产出一把力。她冒着刺骨的寒风，在零下十六度的天气里，和青壮年社员一起战天斗地，闸沟垫地，手上磨起了血泡，裂了大口子，也不歇工。有人劝她不要来干了，她坚定地回答：“天冷怕什么！过去，在这样的天气里，还不是照样去要饭！今天是响应毛主席的号召，闸沟垫地，天气再冷，我也心甘情愿。”
    在王桂荣老大娘的带动下，吕秀兰、孔庆兰、王淑琴等几位老大娘，也不怕严寒，不怕辛苦，参加了闸沟垫地。她们还利用休息时间，给大家表演节目，宣传战无不胜的毛泽东思想。她们干了很多好事，从来没有要记工分。她们一心想着毛主席，一心为集体，没有被工分缠住。
