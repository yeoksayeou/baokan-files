In the midst of the triumphant songs of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, Chairman Mao has issued his latest directive: "Universities must still be run. I am mainly talking about technical and engineering universities, which must still be run. However, the school system must be shortened, education must be revolutionized, and proletarian politics must take command. Follow the path of Shanghai Machine Tool Factory in cultivating technical personnel from among workers. Select students from workers and peasants with practical experience, let them study in school for a few years, and then return to production practice." Chairman Mao has once again stood up for us, the working class, greatly boosting the morale of the revolutionary masses of the proletariat and thoroughly crushing the arrogance of the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party and the reactionary academic "authorities" of the bourgeoisie. This is a long-term strategy to consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat and prevent revisionism. I read Chairman Mao's latest directive over and over again, the more I read, the brighter my heart becomes, my emotions surge, and I raise my arms to shout: "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years of long life to Chairman Mao!"

Looking back on my journey from a worker in a glass factory to a technical personnel in the field of electric light sources, this is entirely due to Chairman Mao and the Party's cultivation. In the matter of cultivating workers as technical personnel, there has been a sharp and intense class struggle over the past decade or so. In the past, scientific research work was monopolized by a handful of reactionary academic "authorities," and workers were not allowed to enter the laboratory. In 1958, under Chairman Mao's great call to "break superstitions and liberate thought," we workers displayed the daring spirit of communism. Under the radiance of Mao Zedong Thought, we fear neither heaven nor earth and have successfully developed many high-precision vacuum instruments that were previously dependent on imports from foreign countries, creating miracles that those reactionary academic "authorities" dared not even think of.

During our development process, those reactionary academic "authorities," in order to maintain their positions, repeatedly obstructed and opposed us, saying things like, "We are Fudan University, who has the qualifications to work on electric light sources? This requires deep knowledge..." However, workers armed with Mao Zedong Thought were not intimidated by them. "Why do foreigners have it, and we don't?" Indeed, we have not obtained any degrees, nor have we done any research work, but we have an unyielding loyalty to Chairman Mao, and the great Mao Zedong Thought guides our struggle. We can overcome all difficulties. In the past, we have also seen some people who thought they had knowledge. They acted arrogantly towards us but were servile towards foreigners. In scientific research work, they always emphasized difficulties, saying that our country's conditions were poor in this aspect and that we needed to import equipment from abroad for that research project, and so on. This negative attitude truly infuriated us workers. Later, we left them aside and conducted our own experiments. Through repeated practice and continuous summarization of experience, we finally succeeded. Our achievements gave those bourgeois "authorities" a resounding slap in the face. The mystification of scientific research was completely shattered by us.

After we achieved our results, some people jumped out to attack us, saying, "What you do is all about technology, there is no theory." We responded with righteous indignation: "Experience summed up through practice is the highest level of theory." After the experiment, we also wrote papers. We did not care about those foreign doctrines but wrote about how Mao Zedong Thought guided us to combine theory with practice.

Seeing that their threats were ineffective, the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party and the reactionary academic "authorities" tried to lure us with fame and fortune, attempting to lead our research down the revisionist path. They proposed a "one lamp, one book" struggle goal for our electric light source laboratory and wanted us to hand over our experimental results to the reactionary academic "authorities" for appraisal, wanting us to kneel at their feet. However, we, the working class, have a global vision, firmly oppose imperialism and revisionism, and are not at all interested in personal fame and fortune. Our research purpose is to serve the needs of the current revolutionary struggle. Therefore, we paid no attention to their schemes.

Now, in our laboratory, two-thirds are workers. When a task comes down, we first clarify its significance and then discuss and research together to solve problems. Practice has proven that for the same task, workers break through key problems much faster than technical personnel with student backgrounds. Workers have practical experience, while intellectuals only have book knowledge and can only talk but not do. They need workers' help to break through key problems.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a great political revolution. The handful of capitalist roaders within the Party have been overthrown, the stumbling blocks hindering our workers from unleashing their creativity have been kicked away, and various rotten bourgeois ideas have been thoroughly criticized. We have once again been liberated in spirit.

The issuance of Chairman Mao's latest directive has greatly inspired our revolutionary workers. We must seriously study the experience of Shanghai Machine Tool Factory, firmly grasp the leadership of science and technology in the hands of the proletariat, and better serve the socialist revolution and socialist construction. Let us raise our hands to welcome the new high tide of educational revolution and industrial revolution!

    工人阶级一定要掌握科学技术领导权
    蔡祖泉
    在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的凯歌声中，毛主席发出了最新指示：“大学还是要办的，我这里主要说的是理工科大学还要办，但学制要缩短，教育要革命，要无产阶级政治挂帅，走上海机床厂从工人中培养技术人员的道路。要从有实践经验的工人农民中间选拔学生，到学校学几年以后，又回到生产实践中去。”毛主席他老人家又一次为我们工人阶级撑了腰，大长了无产阶级革命派的志气，大灭了党内一小撮走资派和资产阶级反动学术
  “权威”的威风。这是巩固无产阶级专政，反修防修的百年大计。我一遍又一遍地朗读毛主席的最新指示，愈读心愈亮，心潮奔腾，振臂高呼：“毛主席万岁！毛主席万万岁！”
    回顾自己从一个玻璃厂的工人成长为电光源的技术人员，这完全是毛主席和党对我的培养。在培养工人技术人员的问题上，解放十几年来，一直存在着尖锐激烈的阶级斗争。过去科学研究工作被一小撮反动学术“权威”所垄断，工人根本不能进实验室。一九五八年，在毛主席“破除迷信，解放思想”的伟大号召下，我们工人发扬了敢想、敢说、敢干的共产主义精神。在毛泽东思想光辉照耀下，我们天不怕，地不怕，试制了不少过去一直依靠外国进口的真空精密仪器，创造了那些反动学术“权威”连想也不敢想的奇迹。
    在我们试制过程中，那些反动学术“权威”，为了维持他们的地位，一再阻挠、反对，说什么“我们复旦，谁有资格搞电光源？这要有高深的学问……。”但是，用毛泽东思想武装起来的工人，并没有被他们所吓倒。“为什么外国人有的，我们没有？”不错，我们没有得到什么学位，没有干过什么研究工作，但是我们有一颗无限忠于毛主席的赤胆忠心，有伟大的毛泽东思想指引我们战斗，我们就能克服一切困难。过去，我们也看到一些自以为有学问的人，他们对我们大摆架子，对洋人却奴性十足。在科研工作中，总是强调这也困难，那也困难；这方面我国条件差，那个科研项目要从外国进口设备，等等。这种消极的态度，真使我们工人气愤。后来，我们把他们丢在一边，自己试验，经过反复实践，不断总结经验，终于试验成功了。我们的成果给了那些资产阶级的“权威”一记响亮的耳光。科学研究的神秘化，完全被我们打破了。
    我们取得成绩以后，有些人又跳出来攻击，说什么：
  “你们搞的都是工艺，没啥理论的。”我们理直气壮地回答：“经过实践总结出来的经验，就是最高水平的理论。”试验以后，我们还写了论文，我们根本不管那一套洋教条，而是写了如何用毛泽东思想指挥我们战斗的理论和实际相结合的论文。
    党内一小撮走资派和反动学术“权威”，见威胁不成，就企图用名利引诱我们，想把我们的研究纳入修正主义的邪道。他们向我们电光源实验室提出什么“一盏灯，一本书”的奋斗目标，还叫我们把试验的成果交给反动学术“权威”去鉴定，要我们拜倒在这些人的脚下。但是，我们工人阶级胸怀世界，坚决反帝反修，根本不是为了个人名利著书立说。我们的科研目的是为当前革命斗争的需要服务。因此，我们根本不理睬他们这一套。
    现在，我们实验室有三分之二是工人。一项任务下来，我们首先明确意义，然后一起商量研究，解决问题。实践证明：同样一项任务，工人同志突破关键问题，比学生出身的技术人员快得多。工人有实践经验，知识分子只有书本知识，只能动嘴，不会动手。他们要突破关键，还得工人帮助。
    无产阶级文化大革命是一场伟大的政治大革命。党内一小撮走资派被打倒了，阻碍我们工人发挥创造力的绊脚石踢开了，各种腐朽的资产阶级思想受到了深刻的批判，我们在精神上又一次得到了解放。
    毛主席这一最新指示的发表，大大激励了我们革命工人的斗志。我们一定要认真学习上海机床厂的经验，把科学技术的领导权，牢牢掌握在无产阶级手里，更好地为社会主义革命和社会主义建设服务。让我们举起双手，迎接教育革命和工业革命新高潮的到来吧！
