Warmly Congratulate the Glorious Victory of the Vietnamese Military and People in Shooting Down 3,000 U.S. Aircraft
The Ministry of National Defense of China Cables the Ministry of National Defense of Vietnam

We firmly believe that the heroic Vietnamese people, by persisting in a protracted war, will surely win the final victory in the war of resistance against U.S. aggression for national salvation. The Chinese military and people will wholeheartedly support the Vietnamese brothers in their war of resistance against U.S. aggression for national salvation until the final victory is achieved.

New China News Agency, July 4th: The Ministry of National Defense of China sent a telegram on June 27th to the Ministry of National Defense of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, warmly congratulating the Vietnamese people and the Vietnamese People's Army on their glorious victory of shooting down 3,000 U.S. aggressor aircraft. The full text of the telegram is as follows:

To the Ministry of National Defense of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, Dear Comrades:

The Vietnamese people and the Vietnamese People's Army, in their heroic battles to punish the U.S. air pirates, have, by June 25th night, shot down 3,000 U.S. aircraft that have been savagely bombing Vietnam. We warmly congratulate you on your glorious victory!

Under the leadership of the great leader Chairman Ho Chi Minh, the heroic Vietnamese people have displayed the spirit of "fighting to the end and winning to the end," united north and south, and united in hatred against the enemy. They have achieved great victories in the war of resistance against U.S. aggression for national salvation. The northern military and people have annihilated a large number of U.S. air pirates. The southern military and people have, since this spring, launched powerful offensives, driving the most ferocious U.S. imperialism into a desperate and disarrayed situation. You have creatively demonstrated the immense power of people's war. The U.S. aggressors are facing imminent doom in the vast ocean of the Vietnamese people's war.

The U.S. imperialism, which is addicted to aggression, will not accept its defeat. As Chairman Ho Chi Minh revealed on May 8th, it is strengthening its aggression in Vietnam while at the same time intensifying the "peace talks" deception. The Vietnamese military and people, with their glorious revolutionary tradition, are not to be intimidated or deceived. We firmly believe that the heroic Vietnamese people, by persisting in a protracted war, will surely win the final victory in the war of resistance against U.S. aggression for national salvation!

Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "The 700 million Chinese people are the staunch rear base of the Vietnamese people, and the vast territory of China is the reliable rear area of the Vietnamese people." The Chinese people and the Chinese People's Liberation Army, tempered by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, will surely follow Chairman Mao's teachings, hold high the banner of proletarian internationalism, and steadfastly support the Vietnamese brothers in their war of resistance against U.S. aggression for national salvation until the final victory is achieved!

    热烈祝贺越南军民击落美机三千架的辉煌胜利
    我国防部致电越南国防部
    坚决相信，英雄的越南人民坚持持久战争，一定能够赢得抗美救国战争的最后胜利。中国军民全力支援越南兄弟的抗美救国战争，直到取得最后胜利
    新华社四日讯　我国防部六月二十七日打电报给越南民主共和国国防部，热烈祝贺兄弟的越南人民和越南人民军击落美国强盗飞机三千架的辉煌胜利。电报全文如下：越南民主共和国国防部亲爱的同志们：
    兄弟的越南人民和越南人民军，在严惩美国空中强盗的英勇战斗中，到六月二十五日夜，已经击落了三千架对越南北方进行野蛮轰炸的美国飞机。我们热烈祝贺你们的辉煌胜利！
    英雄的越南人民在伟大领袖胡志明主席的领导下，发扬“决战决胜”精神，南北一心，同仇敌忾，在抗美救国战争中取得了伟大的胜利。越南北方军民大量歼灭了美国空中强盗。越南南方军民，今春以来，接连发动强大的攻势，把世界上最凶恶的美帝国主义打得走投无路，狼狈不堪。你们创造性地发挥了人民战争的无比威力。美国侵略者在越南人民战争的汪洋大海中，正面临着灭顶之灾。
    侵略成性的美帝国主义决不会甘心于它的失败。正如胡志明主席五月八日揭露的那样，它一面在越南强化侵略战争，一面加紧进行“和平谈判”骗局。有着光荣革命传统的越南军民是吓不倒、骗不了的。我们坚决相信，英雄的越南人民坚持持久战争，一定能够赢得抗美救国战争的最后胜利！
    我们的伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“七亿中国人民是越南人民的坚强后盾，辽阔的中国领土是越南人民的可靠后方。”经过无产阶级文化大革命锻炼的中国人民和中国人民解放军，一定坚决遵循毛主席的教导，更高地举起无产阶级国际主义的旗帜，坚定不移地全力支援越南兄弟的抗美救国战争，直到取得最后胜利！
          中华人民共和国国防部
          一九六八年六月二十七日
