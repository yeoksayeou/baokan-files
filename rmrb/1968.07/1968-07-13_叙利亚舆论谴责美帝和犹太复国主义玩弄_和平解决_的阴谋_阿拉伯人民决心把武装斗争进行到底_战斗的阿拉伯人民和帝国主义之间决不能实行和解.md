Syrian public opinion condemns U.S. imperialism and Zionism's "peaceful resolution" plot. Arab people are determined to continue armed struggle. The fighting Arab people and imperialism cannot reconcile.

	BEIJING, July 11 — The Syrian newspaper *Al-Ba'th* published an editorial on July 9 condemning U.S. imperialism and Zionism for playing a trick with the "peaceful resolution" of the Middle East issue, "to cover up their imperialist expansionist plots in the Arab region."

	The editorial said, "In fact, the 'peaceful method' cannot solve the current struggle in the Middle East, because the nature of this struggle is not, as the enemy propagandizes, a struggle between two nations. This is a struggle of the Arab liberation movement against imperialist forces," and Israeli Zionism is an organized and trained force within the imperialist forces. Therefore, "to achieve reconciliation between imperialism and the fighting Arab people can only give imperialist forces a new opportunity to strengthen their occupation status and legalize the occupation status, while launching a new attack on the liberation movement."

	The editorial pointed out that the hope that the United States will change its policy towards the Arab people is one of the illusions spread by the enemies of the Arab people.

	The Damascus radio station broadcast an editorial on the evening of July 9 saying: "All events that have occurred in the Middle East, as well as related events in other places, prove that the United States bears the main responsibility for the struggle in this region, and at the same time, it shows that the United States is hostile to the Arab people. From these events, it can be seen that the United States uses its various potential in economic, political, and military aspects to support Israeli Zionism and force the Arabs to surrender."

	The editorial said: "The policies of the United States and Zionism are two-faced. On the one hand, they talk about peace and peaceful resolution, and on the other hand, they recently launched an invasion of Suez City."

	The editorial said: "U.S. imperialism and the Israeli criminals attempt to intimidate the Arabs through continuous invasions, forcing them to surrender. However, the armed struggle of the Palestinian people gives a heavy blow to the enemy's plots every day, which is the clear response of the Arabs."

	The editorial concluded, "The Arab masses are determined to continue the armed struggle. They are not afraid of various invasion plots. They will exert their combat potential and raise their revolutionary awareness until all occupied lands are liberated."

    叙利亚舆论谴责美帝和犹太复国主义玩弄“和平解决”的阴谋
    阿拉伯人民决心把武装斗争进行到底
    战斗的阿拉伯人民和帝国主义之间决不能实行和解
    新华社大马士革十一日电　叙利亚《复兴报》九日发表评论，谴责美帝国主义和犹太复国主义正在玩弄“和平解决”中东问题的骗局，“以掩盖它们在阿拉伯地区的帝国主义扩张阴谋”。
    评论说，事实上，“和平的方法解决不了中东目前的斗争问题，因为这场斗争的性质，并不象敌人所宣传的那样是两个民族之间的斗争，这是一场阿拉伯解放运动反对帝国主义势力的斗争”，而以色列犹太复国主义是帝国主义势力中一支有组织有训练的力量。因此，“要在帝国主义和战斗的阿拉伯人民之间实行和解，只能给帝国主义势力一个新的机会，来加强其占领状态，并使占领状态合法化，同时对解放运动发动新的进攻”。
    评论指出，希望美国改变对阿拉伯人的政策，是阿拉伯人民的敌人所散布的幻想之一。
    大马士革电台九日晚上广播一篇评论说：“在中东发生的一切事件，以及在其他地方发生的有关中东问题的事件，证明美国对这个地区发生的斗争要负主要的责任，同时说明美国是敌视阿拉伯人民的。从这些事件还可以看出，美国利用它在经济、政治和军事方面的种种潜力来支持以色列犹太复国主义和迫使阿拉伯人投降”。
    评论说：“美国和犹太复国主义的政策是两面手法，他们一方面谈什么和平及和平解决，另一方面，他们最近又对苏伊士城发动了侵略。”
    评论说：“美帝国主义和以色列罪犯们企图通过不断侵略，吓唬阿拉伯人，逼迫他们投降。但是，巴勒斯坦人民的武装斗争，天天都在给予敌人的阴谋以沉重的打击，这就是阿拉伯人的明确答复。”
    评论最后说，“阿拉伯群众决心把武装斗争进行下去，他们不怕种种侵略阴谋，他们将发挥他们的战斗潜力和提高革命觉悟，直到解放所有被占领的土地为止。”
