	How should we treat the shortcomings and mistakes of the broad revolutionary masses? Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "In such a great revolutionary movement, they inevitably have this or that shortcoming, but their revolutionary general direction is always correct." "We must be good at guiding the petty-bourgeois ideology in our ranks onto the track of proletarian revolution." In our support-left work, we firmly remember Chairman Mao's great teachings, starting from the fundamental viewpoint of protecting the broad masses, resolutely standing on the side of the broad leftist masses, with great political enthusiasm, helping the masses overcome shortcomings and mistakes, and exposing the plot of a small handful of class enemies in the factory to use the masses' shortcomings and mistakes for revenge.

	Comrade Yang Fengming, a member of the Revolutionary Committee of our factory, led the masses at the beginning of the movement to direct the spearhead of struggle at the handful of capitalist-roaders within the party in our factory, breaking through the white terror of the bourgeois reactionary line. In the "January Storm," he, together with the broad revolutionary masses, seized back all the power usurped by the capitalist-roaders. However, in the subsequent counter-revolutionary tide stirred up by the class enemies, he temporarily deviated from the correct direction and made some mistakes. It was precisely when he made mistakes that a small handful of class enemies in the factory took the opportunity to incite a few deceived masses to support his erroneous actions, attempting to drag him down into the abyss, lead him astray, and thereby negate the correct direction of the revolutionary mass organizations, ultimately aiming to reverse their own verdicts. At this time, our support-left group repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's great teaching: "Whether to adopt an attitude of enmity or an attitude of help towards comrades who have made mistakes is a criterion for distinguishing whether a person has good intentions or bad intentions." We saw through the class enemies' counter-revolutionary plot of fake support and real exploitation to reverse verdicts. The support-left group helped him study Chairman Mao's latest instructions, arm his mind with Mao Zedong Thought, and quickly awaken him to examine his mistakes seriously and draw a clear line with the class enemies. At this time, seeing that the tactic of pulling Comrade Yang Fengming over to their side did not work, a small handful of class enemies resorted to the tactic of beating him down, seizing on his individual shortcomings and mistakes, labeling him as a "leader of the counter-current," a "violent criminal," and other fabricated charges. Facing this situation, we carried out Chairman Mao's instruction to "protect the leftists, support the leftists, and build and expand the leftist forces," went deep into the front line of struggle, mobilized the masses extensively, and used a large amount of facts to expose the new plot of a small handful of class enemies. At the same time, through heart-to-heart talks, we further helped Comrade Yang Fengming clarify the direction of struggle, raise his consciousness of line struggle, and stand more firmly on Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, leading the broad revolutionary masses to launch a fierce attack on a small handful of class enemies.

	Chairman Mao recently taught us: "Whether to protect or suppress the broad masses of the people is the fundamental difference between the Communist Party and the Kuomintang, the fundamental difference between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, and the fundamental difference between the dictatorship of the proletariat and the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie." In the practice of class struggle, we deeply feel that towards the shortcomings and mistakes of the masses, towards comrades who have made mistakes, we should have deep proletarian feelings, warmly help them overcome shortcomings and mistakes, guide petty-bourgeois ideology onto the revolutionary track, and make the mass movement flourish and develop. If we stand on the standpoint of the bourgeois reactionary line, we will adopt an attitude of enmity, seize on the masses' shortcomings and mistakes, and take revenge on comrades who have made mistakes. This is to reverse verdicts for Liu Shaoqi and a small handful of class enemies. We, the People's Liberation Army, will forever be the protector of the broad masses of the people, forever stand and fight together with the broad revolutionary masses, thoroughly smash all the plots and tricks of the class enemies to use the masses' shortcomings and mistakes to reverse verdicts, and never allow the class enemies to gain even a single straw from the masses' shortcomings and mistakes.

    热情帮助群众克服缺点错误
    彻底粉碎阶级敌人翻案阴谋
    青岛驻军某部驻青岛国棉三厂支左小组
    怎样对待广大革命群众的缺点和错误？我们伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“在这样大的革命运动中，他们难免有这样那样的缺点，但是，他们的革命大方向始终是正确的。”“必须善于把我们队伍中的小资产阶级思想引导到无产阶级革命的轨道”。我们在支左工作中，牢记毛主席的伟大教导，从保护广大群众这一根本观点出发，坚决站在左派广大群众一边，以极大的政治热情，帮助群众克服缺点、错误，揭露了厂里一小撮阶级敌人借群众的缺点错误进行打击报复的阴谋。
    我们厂革命委员会常委杨风鸣同志，在运动一开始时就带领群众把斗争矛头指向本厂党内一小撮走资派，冲破了资产阶级反动路线的白色恐怖。在“一月风暴”中，又和广大革命群众一起夺回被走资派窃取的一切大权。可是在后来阶级敌人掀起的一股反革命逆流中，他一时背离了大方向，犯了一些错误。正是在他犯错误的时候，厂内一小撮阶级敌人就乘机煽动个别受蒙蔽的群众，支持他的错误行为，企图把他拖下深水，引向绝路，妄图借此否定革命群众组织的大方向，以达到最后为他们自己翻案的目的。这时我们支左小组反复学习了毛主席“对待犯错误的同志，究竟是采取敌视态度还是采取帮助态度，这是区别一个人是好心还是坏心的一个标准”的伟大教导，识破了阶级敌人假支持真利用，进行翻案活动的反革命阴谋。支左小组就帮助他学习毛主席最新指示，用毛泽东思想武装他的头脑，使他很快觉悟过来，认真检查了自己的错误，同阶级敌人划清了界线。这时，一小撮阶级敌人看到对杨风鸣同志用拉的办法拉不过去，就又采取打的手段，抓住他的个别缺点、错误，说他是“逆流干将”、“打人凶手”等，给他加上了许多莫须有的罪名。针对这种情况，我们执行毛主席“要保护左派，支持左派，建立和扩大左派队伍”的指示，深入斗争第一线，广泛发动群众，用大量的事实揭露了一小撮阶级敌人的新阴谋。同时通过谈心，进一步帮助杨风鸣同志认清斗争大方向，提高路线斗争觉悟，更加坚定地站在毛主席革命路线一边，带领广大革命群众向一小撮阶级敌人发起了猛烈的进攻。
    毛主席最近教导我们：“对广大人民群众是保护还是镇压，是共产党同国民党的根本区别，是无产阶级同资产阶级的根本区别，是无产阶级专政同资产阶级专政的根本区别。”在阶级斗争的实践中，我们深深体会到，对待群众的缺点、错误，对待犯过错误的同志，应该怀着深厚的无产阶级感情，热情帮助他们克服缺点、错误，把小资产阶级思想引导到革命的轨道，使群众运动蓬蓬勃勃地向前发展。如果站在资产阶级反动路线的立场上，就会采取仇视态度，抓住群众的缺点、错误不放，对犯过错误的同志进行打击报复。这就是为中国赫鲁晓夫翻案，为一小撮阶级敌人翻案。我们人民解放军永远是广大人民群众的保护者，永远和广大革命群众团结在一起，战斗在一起，彻底粉碎阶级敌人利用群众的缺点、错误进行翻案的一切阴谋诡计，决不能让阶级敌人在群众的缺点、错误问题上捞到半根稻草。
