The revolutionary model opera "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy" is a blooming flower in the garden of proletarian new literature, exuding a rich fragrance; it is a shining pearl in the treasure house of proletarian new literature, radiating brilliant light. At this moment of achieving a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we have the opportunity to watch this excellent play, and our hearts are filled with excitement. We cheer: Long live Chairman Mao! Long live the victory of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line on literature and art!

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Revolutionary war is the war of the masses; it can be waged only by mobilizing the masses and relying on them." "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy" depicts a battle in the early stages of the War of Liberation on the Northeast front, vividly praising the great victory of Chairman Mao's thought on people's war. At that time, within our Party, there was a struggle between two lines, the focus of which was whether to follow Chairman Mao's instructions to mobilize the masses and establish a solid Northeast base area to wage a people's war. The Chinese Khrushchev and his accomplices, the counter-revolutionary revisionists Peng Zhen, have always opposed Chairman Mao's brilliant thought on people's war. They disregarded the future of the Chinese revolution and the fate of millions of revolutionary people in the Northeast, fiercely resisting Chairman Mao's wise instruction to "establish a solid Northeast base area." They cherished cities and abandoned the countryside, refusing to mobilize the masses. They dreamed of negotiating with the Kuomintang reactionaries and fully promoting a thorough line of capitulationism. Vice Chairman Lin, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, resolutely fought against the line of capitulationism advocated by the Chinese Khrushchev and his accomplices, including Peng Zhen. Under the leadership of Vice Chairman Lin, the broad cadres and fighters of the Chinese People's Liberation Army carried out Chairman Mao's wise instruction to "establish a solid Northeast base area," "leave the main roads open and occupy the flanks"; they shifted the focus of their work to cities and vast rural areas far from the Kuomintang's occupied centers, carried out land reform, earnestly mobilized the masses, established solid revolutionary base areas, and surrounded the cities with the countryside, achieving great victories on the Northeast front.

"Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy" vividly shows how the small detachment in Jiaji Gorge propagandized, organized, and armed the masses. The moving plot of "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy" fully demonstrates the powerful force of Chairman Mao's thought on people's war. This detachment of people's revolutionary armed forces was able to outwit and defeat a group of bandits who relied on natural defenses to resist to the death, precisely because they resolutely carried out Chairman Mao's brilliant instructions on people's war.

The Chinese Khrushchev and his accomplices have always opposed Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, claiming that "the thought on people's war is not applicable to naval warfare." This is sheer nonsense. The people's army has grown in the people's war and cannot for a moment be separated from the masses. In the past, every victory in the revolutionary war was achieved by following Chairman Mao's teachings, fully mobilizing the masses, and relying on them to wage a people's war. Today, to oppose imperialist aggression, defend the socialist revolution and socialist construction, and defend the dictatorship of the proletariat, we must still rely on the people's war. We deeply feel that the more modernized our people's army becomes, the more it must be revolutionized, and the more it cannot do without Chairman Mao's brilliant thought on people's war. In every air and naval battle on the South China Sea front, we have mobilized and relied on the masses to achieve victory. We often go deep into fishing villages to propagandize, organize, and arm the masses, establishing a flesh-and-blood bond with the fishermen. When we fight at sea, it is just like the small detachment fighting in the forest and snowfields in the play, receiving support from the masses in every aspect. On the coastal defense front, day and night, we share a cup of water with the fishermen and together strike at the invading enemy. In the August 6th naval battle, it was with the help of the masses that we succeeded in sinking two enemy ships. The army loves the people, the people support the army, and the army and the people unite as one to build an iron wall on the seas of our great motherland.

We resolutely take Vice Chairman Lin as our shining example, being infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, infinitely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. We will always remember Chairman Mao's teachings: "We must trust the masses, rely on the masses, and respect the masses' spirit of initiative." We will always be with the masses, burying all daring enemies in the vast ocean of people's war.

    人民战争胜利的凯歌
    海军某部副指导员、二等战斗功臣　刘风春
    海军某高炮部队团长　史文岭
    京剧样板戏《智取威虎山》，是无产阶级新文艺园地里的一朵鲜花，散发着浓郁的芳香；是无产阶级新文艺宝库里的一颗明珠，闪烁着夺目的光彩。在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的时刻，我们有机会观看这出好戏，心情万分激动。我们欢呼：毛主席万岁！毛主席革命文艺路线胜利万岁！
    毛主席教导我们：“革命战争是群众的战争，只有动员群众才能进行战争，只有依靠群众才能进行战争。”《智取威虎山》描写解放战争初期，东北战场上的一场战斗，形象地歌颂了毛主席的人民战争思想的伟大胜利。当时，在东北战场上，我们党内存在着两条路线的斗争，焦点就在于执行不执行毛主席的放手发动群众，建立巩固的东北根据地的指示，打一场人民战争。中国赫鲁晓夫及其心腹、反革命修正主义分子彭真，一贯反对毛主席人民战争的光辉思想。他们置中国革命的前途和东北千百万革命人民于不顾，疯狂地对抗毛主席“建立巩固的东北根据地”的英明指示，留恋城市，放弃农村，根本不发动群众。他们梦想和国民党反动派和谈，全面推行一条彻头彻尾的投降主义路线。林副主席高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，同中国赫鲁晓夫及其同伙彭真等人的投降主义路线进行了坚决斗争。中国人民解放军的广大指战员，在林副主席领导下，执行了毛主席“建立巩固的东北根据地”的英明指示，“让开大路，占领两厢”；把工作重心放在距离国民党占领中心较远的城市和广大乡村，开展土地改革运动，认真地发动群众，建立巩固的革命根据地，以农村包围城市，取得了东北战场的伟大胜利。
    《智取威虎山》通过小分队在夹皮沟宣传群众，组织群众，武装群众，《智取威虎山》的动人情节，充分体现了毛主席人民战争思想的强大威力。小分队这一支人民革命武装，所以能机智灵活战胜凭借天险负隅顽抗的一群匪徒，完全是因为坚决贯彻了毛主席的关于人民战争英明指示的结果。
    中国赫鲁晓夫及其同伙，一贯反对毛主席的革命路线，胡说什么：“人民战争思想不适用于海战。”这是睁着眼睛说瞎话。人民军队是在人民战争中成长起来的，一刻也不能脱离群众。过去，革命战争的每一个胜利，都是由于遵照毛主席的教导，充分发动群众，依靠群众，打人民战争。今天，要反对帝国主义的侵略，保卫社会主义革命和社会主义建设，保卫无产阶级政权，仍然要依靠人民战争。我们深刻体会到：我们人民军队，越是现代化，越要革命化，就越离不开毛主席人民战争的光辉思想。我们在南海前线每一次空战、海战，都是发动群众，依靠群众，才取得了胜利。我们经常深入渔村宣传群众，组织群众，武装群众，和渔民建立了血肉般的联系。我们在海上作战时，就象剧中的小分队在林海雪原中作战一样，时时事事得到人民群众的支援。在海防前线的日日夜夜，我们和渔民经常同喝一壶水，共同打击来犯的敌人。在“八·六”海战中，我们就是在群众的帮助下，一举击沉了两艘敌舰。军爱民，民拥军，军民一致，建立起我们伟大祖国海上的钢铁长城。
    我们坚决以林副主席为光辉榜样，无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于毛泽东思想，无限忠于毛主席的革命路线。我们永远记住毛主席的教导：“要信任群众，依靠群众，尊重群众的首创精神。”永远和群众在一起，把一切敢于来犯的敌人，彻底埋葬在人民战争的汪洋大海中。
