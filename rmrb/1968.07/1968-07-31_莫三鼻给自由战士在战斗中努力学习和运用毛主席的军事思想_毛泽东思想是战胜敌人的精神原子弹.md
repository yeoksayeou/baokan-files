Mozambican freedom fighters, who are waging armed struggle for national independence and liberation, are diligently studying Chairman Mao's military works. In their struggle against the Portuguese colonial army, which is backed by U.S. imperialism, they continually apply Chairman Mao's brilliant military thought, winning victory after victory. They have deeply felt that "Chairman Mao's great military thought is a beacon, illuminating the path to liberation for the oppressed people." "We must take Mao Zedong's military thought as our guide to defeat the enemy."

The Decisive Factor in War is People, Not Things

In his brilliant work "On Protracted War," Chairman Mao teaches: "Weapons are an important factor in war, but they are not the decisive factor. The decisive factor is people, not things." A veteran guerrilla fighter in his fifties, Mandu Mubai, who has experienced long years of combat, said after studying Chairman Mao's teaching: "Chairman Mao's brilliant thought is a great truth."

He said: "The Portuguese colonial army has planes and cannons, but they always suffer defeats. We have no heavy weapons, but we win victory after victory, and our forces grow stronger and stronger. This shows that the decisive factor in war is people, not things."

He pointed out: "Weapons must be used by people. Without people, any new weapon is like a picture—it can only be looked at and cannot be put to use."

Mandu Mubai is a peasant by birth and has been forced to do hard labor by the Portuguese colonialists several times. He fights very bravely. He has a deep class feeling for Chairman Mao's works. Although he has a low level of education, he persists in studying Chairman Mao's works with the help of others. He recalled that before studying Chairman Mao's works, he did not have a clear understanding of the relationship between weapons and people, and his fighting spirit was not very strong. Later, it was under the enlightenment of Chairman Mao's brilliant thought that he gained the confidence to defeat the enemy. He said: "Only people armed with Mao Zedong Thought can use weapons most bravely and bring out the effectiveness of weapons."

Rely on and Mobilize the Masses in War

In combat, Mozambican freedom fighters apply Chairman Mao's teaching that "revolutionary war is the people's war," paying attention to mobilizing the masses and relying on them, and winning the support of the Mozambican revolutionary masses.

Chairman Mao teaches: "What is the real 'copper-wall iron-battlement'? It is the masses, the hundreds of millions of people who truly support the revolution." In combat, Mozambican freedom fighters have felt that Chairman Mao's teaching is their weapon for defeating the enemy. Guerrilla cadre Andrini said to the fighters: "We must rely on the masses in our struggle and fully mobilize them. We must, as Chairman Mao teaches, always be with the masses."

The Mozambican working people, who have long suffered under Portuguese colonialism, regard the guerrilla fighters as their own people, guiding them, providing intelligence, and supplying them with food and clothing. These facts deeply moved the guerrilla fighters. Fighter Raul said: "We must cherish and respect the people. Without unity between the army and the people, our cause will suffer defeat; without the people's support, we cannot achieve victory." Another fighter said: "We not only rely on the oppressed people but also mobilize and educate them, because they are most receptive to revolutionary ideas and most supportive of the liberation struggle."

Brave in Battle, Fearless of Sacrifice

After studying Chairman Mao's strategies and tactics on close combat, night combat, and annihilation battles, Mozambican freedom fighters have become even more determined in combat and their fighting strength has increased.

In March of this year, a squad of guerrilla fighters bravely attacked and destroyed an enemy stronghold at Nambudi, annihilating almost an entire company of Portuguese colonial troops and seizing a large number of weapons and ammunition.

Guerrilla cadre Fokasi said, "We must fight according to Chairman Mao's teachings, exploiting our strengths, daring to charge, fighting close combat and night combat, catching the enemy off guard and annihilating them completely."

Fighter Renkai said: "To annihilate the enemy, we must be brave and fearless of death, like the Chinese hero Huang Jiguang, sacrificing for the greater good. As long as there is one person, that person must continue the fight."

Revolutionary Fighters Cannot Do Without Mao Zedong Thought

Now, more and more Mozambican freedom fighters are diligently studying Chairman Mao's works.

Fighter Bokasi, after studying Chairman Mao's works, said with sincere feelings: "Mao Zedong Thought is a spiritual atomic bomb. Chairman Mao's works have shown us the way to liberation. We will forever cherish Chairman Mao's precious books."

Cadre Onesto said: "Mao Zedong Thought is a powerful ideological weapon against imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries of all countries. With Mao Zedong Thought, we will achieve victory; without Mao Zedong Thought, we will fail."

    莫三鼻给自由战士在战斗中努力学习和运用毛主席的军事思想
    毛泽东思想是战胜敌人的精神原子弹
    新华社达累斯萨拉姆三十日电　为争取祖国独立和解放而进行武装斗争的莫三鼻给自由战士，努力学习毛主席的军事著作，在同美帝国主义支持下的葡萄牙殖民军的斗争中，不断运用毛主席的天才的军事思想，赢得一个又一个的胜利。他们深有体会地说：“毛主席的伟大军事思想是一盏明灯，照亮了被压迫人民求解放的道路。”“必须用毛泽东军事思想作为指导，才能战胜敌人。”
    决定战争胜负的是人不是物
    毛主席在《论持久战》这部光辉著作中教导说：“武器是战争的重要的因素，但不是决定的因素，决定的因素是人不是物。”一位经历过长期战斗的年过五十的莫三鼻给游击战士曼杜木白在学习了毛主席的这一教导后说：“毛主席的这一光辉思想是伟大的真理。”
    他说：“葡萄牙殖民军有飞机大炮，但他们总打败仗。我们没有重武器，但我们赢得一个又一个胜利，队伍越来越壮大。这就看出决定战争胜负的是人不是物。”
    他指出：“武器必须由人来掌握。没有人，任何新式的武器就象一张图画一样，只能看，不能发挥作用。”
    曼杜木白是农民出身，过去曾几次被葡萄牙殖民主义者抓去作苦工。他作战非常勇敢。他对毛主席著作怀有深厚的阶级感情。他文化水平低，是在别人帮助下坚持学习毛主席著作的。他回顾说，在学习毛主席著作以前，由于对武器和人的关系认识不清，斗争信心不太足。后来，正是在毛主席光辉思想的启发下，增强了战胜敌人的信心。他说：“只有用毛泽东思想武装起来的人才能最勇敢地使用武器，发挥武器的作用。”
      依靠和动员群众进行战争
    莫三鼻给自由战士在战斗中运用毛主席关于“革命战争是群众的战争”的教导，注意发动群众和依靠群众，得到莫三鼻给革命群众的拥护和支持。
    毛主席教导说：“真正的铜墙铁壁是什么？是群众，是千百万真心实意地拥护革命的群众。”莫三鼻给自由战士在战斗中体会到毛主席这一教导是他们克敌制胜的武器。游击队干部安邓里纳对战士们说：“我们进行斗争必须要依靠群众，要充分动员群众。要象毛主席教导的那样，经常和群众在一起。”
    受葡萄牙殖民主义长期压迫的莫三鼻给劳动人民把游击战士看成自己人，给他们带路、送情报和提供衣食。这些事实使游击战士十分感动。战士劳尔说：“我们必须爱护人民、尊重人民。如果没有军民之间的团结，我们的事业就要遭到失败；没有人民的拥护，我们就不能取得胜利。”另一名战士说：我们不但要依靠受压迫的人民群众，还要动员他们，教育他们，因为他们最容易接受革命道理，最支持解放斗争。
        勇敢战斗，不怕牺牲
    莫三鼻给自由战士在学习了毛主席关于近战、夜战、歼灭战等战略战术后，战斗意志更加旺盛，战斗力也提高了。
    今年三月，一队游击战士在袭击设在楠布迪的一个敌军据点时，勇敢作战，一举摧毁了这个据点，歼灭了几乎一个整连的葡萄牙殖民军，缴获了许多武器弹药。
    一位游击队干部弗卡斯说，“我们必须按照毛主席的教导去作战，发挥我们的特长，敢冲击，打近战，打夜战，打得敌人措手不及，全部消灭敌人。”
    战士仁开说：“要消灭敌人就要勇敢不怕死，象中国英雄黄继光那样，为整体利益英勇牺牲。只要有一个人，这个人就要战斗下去。”
    革命战士离不开毛泽东思想
    现在，越来越多的莫三鼻给自由战士在孜孜不倦地认真学习毛主席的著作。
    战士博阔斯学习了毛主席著作后怀着真挚的感情说：“毛泽东思想是精神原子弹。毛主席的著作告诉了我们求解放的方向。我们永远爱护毛主席的宝书。”
    干部欧内斯托说：“毛泽东思想是反对帝国主义、修正主义和各国反动派的强大的思想武器。有了毛泽东思想我们就获得胜利，没有毛泽东思想就要失败。”
