The Australian Communist Party (Marxist-Leninist) organ, the "Pioneer," published an article titled "Mao Zedong Thought Becomes a Great Material Force" on July 11, from which the following is excerpted:

Recently, various magazines in Australia, including those considered "progressive," have published articles slandering Mao Zedong Thought.

This shows that more and more Australian people are becoming familiar with revolutionary Mao Zedong Thought.

It also shows that Australian Marxist-Leninists have been doing beneficial work and have achieved some success.

Chairman Mao said: "I think that for us, a person, a party, an army, or a school, if it is not opposed by the enemy, that would be bad; that would mean that we have gone over to the enemy's side. If we are opposed by the enemy, that would be good; that would prove that we have drawn a clear line of demarcation with the enemy. If the enemy vigorously opposes us, slandering us and saying that we are utterly bad and worthless, that would be even better; that would prove not only that we have drawn a clear line of demarcation with the enemy but also that our work has achieved great success." ("It Is Good to Be Opposed by the Enemy, Not Bad")

Mao Zedong Thought is the highest development of Marxism-Leninism. Mao Zedong Thought is the Marxism-Leninism of the era when capitalism and imperialism suffer defeat and socialism achieves world victory.

Mao Zedong Thought particularly stings the bourgeoisie because Mao Zedong Thought is a great liberating force.

Mao Zedong has shown that man is superior to weapons, and the oppressed are superior to their oppressors.

Mao Zedong Thought has withstood severe tests in practice. Mao Zedong Thought has achieved great victories. Practice is the test of truth.

Without Mao Zedong Thought, imperialism cannot be defeated. This truth has also been tested in practice.

Hundreds of millions of people around the world are now acting according to Mao Zedong Thought. They are guided by Mao Zedong's theoretical summaries. Whenever people act according to Mao Zedong Thought, they achieve victory.

The most outstanding example of this is Vietnam. The people of South Vietnam have proven that Mao Zedong's theory of people's war is correct.

It is precisely those who hold weapons and act according to Mao Zedong Thought who are making the imperialists yield.

People are learning the clear truth that "political power grows out of the barrel of a gun."

Let the bourgeoisie shout and roar! Nothing can destroy Mao Zedong Thought. Mao Zedong Thought will become an increasingly powerful liberating force because hundreds of millions of people are mastering Mao Zedong Thought, acting according to Mao Zedong Thought, and turning Mao Zedong Thought into an invincible material force.

    澳《先锋报》赞扬毛泽东思想
    人们正在把毛泽东思想变成不可战胜的物质力量
    新华社二十三日讯　澳大利亚共产党（马克思列宁主义）机关报《先锋报》七月十一日发表题为《毛泽东思想成为巨大的物质力量》的文章，摘要如下：
    最近（澳大利亚）各种杂志，包括那些被认为是“进步”的杂志，发表了一些文章，污蔑毛泽东思想。
    它说明了，越来越多的澳大利亚人民正在熟悉革命的毛泽东思想。
    它说明了，澳大利亚马克思列宁主义者一直在作有益的工作，并且做出了一些成绩。
    毛泽东主席说：“我认为，对我们来说，一个人，一个党，一个军队，或者一个学校，如若不被敌人反对，那就不好了，那一定是同敌人同流合污了。如若被敌人反对，那就好了，那就证明我们同敌人划清界线了。如若敌人起劲地反对我们，把我们说得一塌糊涂，一无是处，那就更好了，那就证明我们不但同敌人划清了界线，而且证明我们的工作是很有成绩的了。”（《被敌人反对是好事而不是坏事》）
    毛泽东思想是马克思列宁主义的最高发展。毛泽东思想是资本主义、帝国主义遭到失败，社会主义取得全世界胜利时代的马克思列宁主义。
    毛泽东思想特别刺痛资产阶级，因为毛泽东思想是巨大的解放力量。
    毛泽东已经表明，人胜过武器，受压迫的人胜过压迫他们的人。
    毛泽东思想已经在实践中经受了严峻的考验。毛泽东思想已经取得了很大的胜利。实践是对真理的检验。
    没有毛泽东思想，就不能打败帝国主义。这个真理在实践中也得到了检验。
    全世界千百万人民现在正按照毛泽东思想办事。他们得到了毛泽东的理论概括的指导。每当人们按照毛泽东思想办事，他们就会取得胜利。
    这方面最突出的例子是越南。越南南方人民证明毛泽东关于人民战争的理论是正确的。
    正是那些手里拿着武器、按照毛泽东思想办事的人，正在使帝国主义者屈服。
    人们正在学习“枪杆子里面出政权”这条明白的真理。
    让资产阶级去叫嚷和咆哮吧！没有任何东西能够破坏毛泽东思想。毛泽东思想将成为越来越强大的解放力量，因为千百万人民正在掌握毛泽东思想，按毛泽东思想办事，并把毛泽东思想变成不可战胜的物质力量。
