On June 23rd, a Sunday, the workers of Tianjin Color Weaving Factory No. 14 were on their regular day off. However, a volunteer labor squad of over ten people was working hard to install skylights in the warping room. What was going on?

The factory was built using old factory buildings. The warping room was located between the boiler room and the sizing room. Two high-temperature air supply pipes extended from the boiler room to the sizing room, crossing above the warping room. Below the floor, there were two return air pipes. Additionally, the walls on both sides were high-temperature rooms, making the warping room very hot. Every summer, workers couldn't work for a few minutes without sweating profusely, directly affecting their work and health.

In the past, workers had suggested this issue many times, but the old bureaucratic leadership of the factory had not taken it seriously. Later, as workers' opinions grew stronger, the factory leadership, without conducting on-site investigations or consulting the workers, made a decision in the office: to add 2 jiao (0.2 yuan) per day to each worker's high-temperature health subsidy. After learning about this decision, the workers were even more upset and went to the factory leadership to voice their opinions: "We want a thorough solution to the problem, not just a few jiao."

This issue was not resolved until after the Revolutionary Committee was established.

One day, the head of the Revolutionary Committee, Yuan Lin, came to the warping room to work. He had only been in the room for three minutes when he was already sweating profusely, his clothes soaked. Yuan Lin approached Li Shifu, and their sweat mixed together, as did their hearts. They worked and talked as they went. Li Shifu, wiping his sweat with a towel, said, "Yuan Lin, look at this room. It's like this day and night in the summer. We need to find a solution." Yuan Lin said, "Yes! When I was the factory party committee secretary, I didn't care enough about the people. I only heard that it was very hot here, but I didn't experience it myself, so I didn't seriously think about solving the problem." After a pause, he asked, "Old Li, what do you think we should do?"

Li Shifu thought for a moment and said, "The workers have been talking about it for a long time. If we open a large skylight from the roof, it will be both ventilated and bright, solving the problem."

The workday ended, and Chairman Mao's teachings on caring for the people's lives echoed in Yuan Lin's ears. He walked and thought, "Today's problems should be solved today, not pushed to tomorrow." At the meeting after work, he discussed the issue with other committee members. Everyone agreed with the old workers' suggestion and decided to open a skylight immediately.

Action was taken right away. To avoid affecting production, it was agreed to organize a volunteer labor day on the next public holiday to complete the task. After work, the workers in the warping room who were participating in "Daily Reading" heard the news and eagerly volunteered to join the volunteer labor. There were too many volunteers, and finally, the Revolutionary Committee approved a few bricklayers, carpenters, and cadres to form a volunteer labor squad of over ten people. The next morning, they began their work. After a day of hard work, a 20-meter-long skylight was completed. The workers entered the now ventilated and bright room and happily said, "Cadres set an example, the workshop changes greatly, hearts united, full of strength."

    一支义务劳动小分队的诞生 　 六月二十三日，是个星期天。天津色织十四厂的工人们照例公休。可是由十多人组成的义务劳动小分队，正在紧张地为整经车间开设天窗。这是怎么回事呢？
    这个厂是利用过去的旧厂房建起来的，整经车间，正好位于锅炉房和浆纱车间之间，从锅炉房伸向浆纱车间的两根高温送气管，横穿整经车间的上空，地板下面还有两根回流气管，再加上两边都是高温车间的墙壁，整经车间的温度也变得很高了，每到夏天，工作不了几分钟，就汗如雨下，直接影响着工作和工人的健康。
    过去，工人们为这件事不知提过多少次建议，可是厂里旧的官僚主义的领导，一直没有认真解决。后来，工人们意见越来越多，厂里的领导既没有去现场调查，又没有征求工人们的意见，就坐在办公室里作了个决定：每人每天加两角钱高温保健补助费。工人们知道这个决定后更加生气了，纷纷找厂里的领导提意见：“我们要的是彻底解决问题，而不是几角钱。”
    这个问题一直拖到革命委员会成立以后。
    有一天，革委会主任袁林来到整经车间劳动，他刚进车间还没有干三分钟，就汗流浃背，衣服湿透。袁林靠近李师傅，两人的汗水滴在一起，心也想在一起。他们边劳动，边交谈起来。李师傅用汗水浸透了的毛巾擦了一把汗，关切地说：“袁林啊，你看这个车间，一到夏天昼夜都是这样，应该想个法子啦。”袁林惭愧地说：“是啊！我以前当厂党委书记，也太不关心群众啦，原来只听说这里夏天很热，可是没有亲身体会，也就一直没有认真想办法解决。”袁林停了停又问：“老李啊，你看怎么解决好？”李师傅沉思了一下说：“工人们早就念叨过了，如果从房顶上开个大天窗，既通风，又明亮，问题就解决啦。”
    下班时间到了，毛主席关于要关心群众的生活的谆谆教导，一直响在袁林的耳边。他边走边盘算：“今天应该解决的问题，不能推到明天。”在下班后的碰头会上，他就和其他委员研究了这个问题。大家一致同意老工人的建议，立刻开一个天窗。
    说干就干。为了不影响生产，一致同意利用第二天的公休日，组织一次义务劳动，完成这个任务。下班后正在进行“天天读”的整经车间的工人们听到了这个消息后，纷纷要求参加义务劳动。报名的人太多了，最后革委会批准了几个瓦工、木工和干部，组成了一支十多人的义务劳动小分队。第二天一早，就投入了战斗。经过一整天的紧张劳动，一条二十米长的天窗开成了。工人们走进既通风又明亮的车间，高兴地说：“干部作榜样，车间大变样，心往一处想，浑身是力量”。
