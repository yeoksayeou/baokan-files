The revolutionary oil painting *Chairman Mao Goes to Anyuan* is a work of art that shines with the brilliant light of Mao Zedong Thought, possesses great political significance, and has a high artistic level. This painting successfully depicts the glorious image and revolutionary practice of our dearest leader, Chairman Mao, in his youth. It vividly expresses, through artistic language, the struggle within the Party between the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao and the reactionary bourgeois line represented by the Chinese Khrushchev. This is a great and sublime image, a magnificent poem. This painting, like the piano-accompanied *The Red Lantern*, is a model of revolutionary literature and art that all literary and artistic workers should study and learn from. It is another great victory for Chairman Mao's revolutionary literary and artistic line, and it will be recorded in the history of proletarian revolutionary literature and art.

The revolutionary oil painting *Chairman Mao Goes to Anyuan* is a precious historical record and a red textbook. Being closely connected with the masses is one of the fine traditions of our Party. Who passed down this tradition? This painting provides a vivid answer: it was Chairman Mao! In the tumultuous year of 1921, soon after the founding of the Communist Party of China, our great leader Chairman Mao traveled to Anyuan to spread the seeds of revolution among the workers. With his great revolutionary practice, Chairman Mao initiated the fine tradition of our Party being closely connected with the masses. From then on, the Chinese working class and the people found their savior, and the Chinese revolution had hope. From then on, the universal truths of Marxism-Leninism were combined with the Chinese workers' movement, giving birth to contemporary Marxism-Leninism—Mao Zedong Thought. From then on, within our Party, a proletarian revolutionary line began to take shape, and the first glorious page of the history of the struggle between the two lines within the Party was written.

    珍贵的历史记录　红色的教科书
    革命油画《毛主席去安源》，是一幅闪烁着毛泽东思想灿烂光辉、具有伟大政治意义又有高度艺术水平的战斗的艺术品。这幅油画成功地表现了我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席青年时代的光辉形象和革命实践，把党内以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线同以中国赫鲁晓夫为代表的资产阶级反动路线的斗争用艺术语言生动地表达出来。这是伟大崇高的形象，光辉壮丽的诗篇。这幅油画，和钢琴伴唱《红灯记》一样，是值得广大文艺工作者学习再学习的革命文艺又一样板，是毛主席革命文艺路线的又一伟大胜利，将要在无产阶级革命文艺史上大书一笔。
    革命油画《毛主席去安源》，是珍贵的历史记录，又是红色的教科书。紧密联系群众，是我党优良的传统作风之一。这个传统是谁传下来的呢？这幅油画形象地回答了这个问题：是毛主席！在那风云突变的一九二一年，在中国共产党诞生不久，我们伟大领袖毛主席就风尘仆仆地到安源工人中传播革命火种。毛主席以伟大的革命实践，开创了我党紧密联系群众的优良传统。从此，中国工人阶级和人民群众找到了救星，中国革命有了希望。从此，马克思列宁主义普遍真理和中国工人运动结合了起来，产生了当代的马克思列宁主义——毛泽东思想。从此，在我们党内，开始形成了一条无产阶级革命路线，为党内两条路线的斗争历史写下了光辉的第一页。
