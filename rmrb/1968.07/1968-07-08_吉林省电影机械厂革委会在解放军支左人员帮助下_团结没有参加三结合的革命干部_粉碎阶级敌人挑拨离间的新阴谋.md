The Revolutionary Committee of Jilin Film Machinery Factory, with the help of the PLA's leftist support team, has united revolutionary cadres who did not participate in the three-in-one combination, following Chairman Mao's instructions to "trust and rely on the majority of cadres." They have successfully smashed the new intrigues of the class enemy to sow discord.

The Revolutionary Committee of Jilin Film Machinery Factory was established with the help of the PLA's leftist support team. Most of the cadres in the factory were liberated. The Revolutionary Committee assigned specific responsibilities to cadres who did not participate in the three-in-one combination, providing timely guidance and support, encouraging them to work boldly. Under the leadership of the Revolutionary Committee, these cadres worked diligently and made significant contributions to the revolution and production. However, as the factory deepened its revolutionary criticism and launched a fierce attack on the class enemy, the Revolutionary Committee and the PLA comrades discovered that some of these cadres focused more on business operations and less on actively exposing and criticizing the class enemy. They had a vague understanding of the current class struggle: cadres who participated in the three-in-one combination should mainly focus on class struggle, while those who did not should mainly focus on production. By working together, they could achieve both revolution and production.

A small group of class enemies within the factory saw this as an opportunity to stir up trouble. They spread rumors and sowed discord among the cadres who did not participate in the three-in-one combination, trying to drive a wedge between these cadres and the Revolutionary Committee. A former deputy director of a workshop, fearing to make new mistakes, was eager to work on production but was not bold enough in class struggle. A capitalist roader cunningly told him: "Cadres who stand out but do not participate in the three-in-one combination have no power, their words are not heeded, and their work is not supported; cadres who participate in the three-in-one combination have power but lack ability, and the factory's production still relies on the few who do not participate in the three-in-one combination..."

The Revolutionary Committee and the PLA comrades analyzed the class enemy's intrigues using class analysis: the goal was to sow discord between the cadres who did not participate in the three-in-one combination and the Revolutionary Committee, to undermine the stability and development of the Revolutionary Committee, and to split and weaken the revolutionary forces' core in the struggle against the enemy. They realized that whether or not these cadres could be united was a crucial condition for the victory of the struggle against the enemy. Uniting these cadres would further isolate the enemy and strengthen the Revolutionary Committee; neglecting to unite them would give the enemy an opportunity to exploit loopholes, disrupt our class lines, and weaken our fighting strength against the enemy. Therefore, in the current fierce class struggle, it was not enough to just liberate the majority of cadres and let them work; it was more important to unite them in the storm of class struggle, to forge them into steadfast warriors defending Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and to fully utilize their core roles.

The factory's Revolutionary Committee mobilized a wide range of revolutionary cadres to stand on the front line of class struggle. At the same time, they organized extensive Mao Zedong Thought study classes, arming the revolutionary cadres with Chairman Mao's theories, lines, principles, and policies on continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat. They organized them to deeply carry out revolutionary criticism, raising their awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines. The Revolutionary Committee also did a great deal of political and ideological work for a few cadres who had reservations. The former deputy director of the workshop, who had previously been afraid to stand on the front line of class struggle, realized that he had fallen into the trap of the factory's capitalist roaders by focusing only on production and not on class struggle. He had followed their revisionist line of managing the factory. If he did not dare to boldly engage in class struggle now, he would again fall into the enemy's trap. After raising his awareness, he became spirited and enthusiastic, joining the battle.

Revolutionary cadres who did not participate in the three-in-one combination deeply realized, through this practice of class struggle, that the Revolutionary Committee is the battle command center for carrying out class struggle. The more the class enemy tries to sabotage it, the more we must consciously unite around it, cherish it, strengthen it, and defend it, not giving the class enemy any opportunity. Once, a capitalist roader seized on some minor flaws in the command of production by some new cadres in the Revolutionary Committee and spread rumors: "The Revolutionary Committee is not good at leading production." A revolutionary cadre who did not participate in the three-in-one combination immediately refuted this severely. He used the facts of the Revolutionary Committee using Mao Zedong Thought to achieve the thought reform of people and to promote revolution and production. He criticized the past crimes of this capitalist roader in promoting material incentives, bonus systems, and deceit. He firmly defended the authority of the Revolutionary Committee.

The Revolutionary Committee united the revolutionary cadres who did not participate in the three-in-one combination, effectively isolating and striking at a small group of class enemies. These revolutionary cadres, in fighting side by side with the broad revolutionary masses, promoted their own thought reform and further strengthened the relationship between cadres and the masses. Revolutionary cadres and revolutionary masses united as one, working together to seize class struggle, further consolidating and developing the revolutionary great alliance and the revolutionary three-in-one combination. The factory's situation of seizing revolution and promoting production became better and better, with the second quarter's production significantly increasing over the first quarter.

    吉林省电影机械厂革委会在解放军支左人员帮助下
    团结没有参加三结合的革命干部
    粉碎阶级敌人挑拨离间的新阴谋
    本报讯　吉林省电影机械厂革命委员会，在解放军支左人员帮助下，遵照毛主席关于“相信和依靠干部的大多数”的教导，把没有参加三结合的革命干部紧紧团结在自己的周围，及时粉碎了阶级敌人挑拨离间的新阴谋。
    电影机械厂革命委员会成立的时候，全厂大部分干部都解放了。革委会对没有参加三结合的干部，分配了具体的负责工作，并及时给予指导和帮助，鼓励他们放手大胆地工作。这些干部在革委会的领导下，工作勤勤恳恳，在抓革命促生产中做出了成绩。但是，正当全厂深入开展革命大批判，向阶级敌人发动了猛烈进攻的时候，革委会和解放军的同志发现这些干部中，有的人埋头抓业务多，主动揭发批判阶级敌人少。他们对当前阶级斗争还有个模糊认识：结合的干部主要应当抓阶级斗争，没有结合的干部主要应当抓好生产，互相配合起来，可以把革命和生产搞好。
    厂内一小撮阶级敌人窥测到这种可乘之机，就拚命地在没有结合的革命干部中煽阴风，点鬼火，挑拨这些干部同革委会的关系。有个车间原副主任，由于怕犯新错误，搞生产积极努力，抓阶级斗争不够大胆。一个走资派鬼头鬼脑地对他说：站出来的干部不结合，手里没有权，说话没人听，工作没人帮；结合的干部有权力，没能力，厂里的生产还是靠没有结合的那几把手……。
    革委会和解放军的同志一起用阶级分析的方法，分析了阶级敌人的阴谋：目的是挑拨未结合的干部同革委会的关系，破坏革委会的巩固和发展，分裂和削弱革命队伍对敌斗争的骨干力量。他们认识到：能不能团结好这些干部，是胜利开展对敌斗争的重要条件，团结好这些干部，敌人就更加孤立，革委会就会更加巩固；忽视对这些干部的团结，敌人就会乘机钻空子，搅乱我们的阶级阵线，削弱我们对敌斗争的战斗力。因此，在当前激烈的阶级斗争中，绝不能只满足于把大多数干部解放出来，让他们抓工作就行了；更重要的是要团结他们在阶级斗争的大风浪中冲锋陷阵，把他们锻炼成为捍卫毛主席革命路线的坚强战士，充分发挥他们的骨干作用。
    这个厂的革委会放手发动广大革命干部站到阶级斗争第一线。同时大办毛泽东思想学习班，用毛主席关于在无产阶级专政条件下继续进行革命的理论、路线、方针、政策，把革命干部武装起来，组织他们深入开展革命大批判，提高他们的阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟。革委会对少数思想有顾虑的干部，还做了大量的政治思想工作。原来不敢站到阶级斗争第一线的那个车间副主任认识到，过去自己由于只抓生产，不问阶级斗争，才上了厂内走资派的当，跟着他们执行了修正主义办厂路线；当前如果再不敢大胆投入阶级斗争，又会中了阶级敌人的诡计。他认识提高后，精神振奋，斗志昂扬，投入了战斗。
    没有参加三结合的革命干部，在这场阶级斗争的实践中，深刻地认识到，革命委员会是搞好阶级斗争的战斗指挥部。阶级敌人越是千方百计地破坏它，我们越是要自觉地团结在它的周围，爱护它，巩固它，保卫它，不给阶级敌人一点可乘之机。有一次，一个走资派抓住革委会中的一些新干部指挥生产时的个别缺点，大肆造谣说：“革委会领导生产不行”。一位没有参加三结合的革命干部听到以后，立即严厉驳斥。他以革委会用毛泽东思想搞好人的思想革命化，抓革命促生产的大量事实，批判了这个走资派过去大搞物质刺激、奖金挂帅、弄虚作假的罪行，坚决维护了革委会的权威。
    革委会把没有参加三结合的革命干部紧紧地团结在自己的周围，有力地孤立和打击了一小撮阶级敌人。没有参加三结合的革命干部，也在同广大革命群众并肩战斗中，促进了自己的思想革命化，进一步密切了干群关系。革命干部和革命群众团结一致，同心协力，狠抓阶级斗争，进一步巩固和发展了革命的大联合和革命的三结合，全厂抓革命促生产的形势越来越好，第二季度的生产比第一季度大幅度地增产。
