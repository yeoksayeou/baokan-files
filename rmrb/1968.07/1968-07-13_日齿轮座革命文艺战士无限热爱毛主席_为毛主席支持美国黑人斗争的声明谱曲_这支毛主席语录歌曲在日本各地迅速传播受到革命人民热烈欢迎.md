Japanese revolutionary artists of the Gear Seat, with unlimited love for the great leader Chairman Mao, recently composed a song based on a passage from Chairman Mao's statement supporting the struggle of American blacks against violence. This song has been enthusiastically welcomed by the revolutionary people of Japan.

On June 23, revolutionary masses in Yamaguchi Prefecture held a rally in Iwakuni City to demand the withdrawal of U.S. military bases and the abolition of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty." At the rally, artists from the Gear Seat troupe performed for the first time a song based on Chairman Mao's quote: "The people of the world should unite more closely and launch a sustained and powerful attack on our common enemy, U.S. imperialism and its accomplices." The powerful and stirring song voiced Chairman Mao's great call to battle, greatly inspiring the fighting spirit of the Japanese revolutionary masses against U.S. imperialism and its accomplices. This shows that Chairman Mao's great statement supporting the struggle of American blacks against violence is becoming a powerful ideological weapon for the anti-imperialist struggle of the Japanese revolutionary people.

At present, this song based on Chairman Mao's quote is rapidly spreading throughout Yamaguchi Prefecture and other regions of Japan.
