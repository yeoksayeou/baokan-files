Inspired and motivated by the great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin Biao's two receptions of the nationwide coal industry representatives for the conference on grabbing revolution and promoting production, coal mines across the country have achieved new victories in revolution and production. With the help of the People's Liberation Army, most units have achieved revolutionary great unity and revolutionary three-in-one combination. They have taken class struggle as the key link, vigorously carried out revolutionary criticism, and combined it with the cleansing of class ranks; implemented streamlining and efficiency, maintained close ties with the masses, and effectively promoted the development of production.

A Xinhua News Agency report on July 13 stated that under the great inspiration and promotion of the great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin Biao's two receptions of the representatives of the nationwide coal industry conference on grabbing revolution and promoting production, coal mines across the country have shown a thriving and prosperous situation. The broad revolutionary workers, with their profound proletarian feelings of boundless love and loyalty to Chairman Mao, have further implemented Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, vigorously grabbed the revolution, and promoted production, achieving new victories in both revolution and production.

So far, the large coal mines directly under the Ministry of Coal Industry have, in the vast majority of units, achieved revolutionary great unity on the basis of Mao Zedong Thought. More than 70% of the units have achieved revolutionary three-in-one combination. Under the leadership of the revolutionary committees at various levels and the assistance of the People's Liberation Army's leftist personnel, the revolutionary criticism in various mining areas has surged higher and higher, and various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes have been increasingly well-organized. The enthusiasm of the broad revolutionary workers in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works has never been as high as it is now. The revolution has promoted production. In June, the average daily output of large coal mines nationwide increased by more than 10% compared to May, and in the first week of July, it increased again compared to June. In particular, on July 1, the day after Chairman Mao's second reception of the nationwide coal mine workers' representatives, the broad revolutionary workers, to celebrate the birthday of the Party and to repay Chairman Mao's care for the miners, many coal mines created the highest production records since 1960. On that day, the daily output of raw coal in large coal mines nationwide exceeded the state plan by more than 20%.

The great leader Chairman Mao personally formulated the "Sixteen Points," which states: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a powerful driving force for the development of social productive forces in our country." The thriving new situation in various mining areas is, first of all, the result of deeply carrying out revolutionary criticism and grabbing class struggle. The workers of Kaiping and Datong Coal Mines, with their boundless love for the great leader Chairman Mao, took to the battlefield of criticism, fiercely criticizing the Chinese Khrushchev and other handful of capitalist roaders within the party. They said: In the evil old society, miners were worse off than cattle and horses. It was Chairman Mao and the Communist Party that saved us from the depths of misery and made us masters of the state. The Chinese Khrushchev wants to drag us back to the old road, making us suffer twice, which is a futile attempt, impossible by a thousand or ten thousand times. In the revolutionary criticism, the workers vehemently denounced the revisionist goods such as "material incentives" and "bonus leadership" peddled by the handful of capitalist roaders within the party and their agents in the coal industry, and took steps to reform unreasonable systems in conjunction with the criticism. The enthusiasm for revolution and production has greatly increased. In June, both mines completed their production plans ahead of schedule and exceeded the quota; after entering July, they continued to create high production records.

In the deepening of revolutionary criticism, Beijing, Zaozhuang, Huainan, Qitaihe, Benxi, Fuxin, Liaoyuan, Jiaozuo, Xinwen, Handan, and other coal mines closely combined it with the cleansing of class ranks. The miners fiercely criticized the Chinese Khrushchev's "theory of the extinction of class struggle" and the traitor philosophy and other counter-revolutionary revisionist fallacies, and dug out hidden traitors, spies, unrepentant capitalist roaders, and other counter-revolutionary elements. Due to the intense class struggle, the proletarian consciousness and the consciousness of the two-line struggle of the workers have been greatly enhanced, and production has shown a new situation.

After the publication of the "July 1" editorial by the People's Daily, Red Flag Magazine, and the Liberation Army Daily, coal mines across the country have closely followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, regarding the promotion of the Party's fine tradition of close ties with the masses as the fundamental way to build revolutionary committees. Many coal mine revolutionary committees have taken measures to streamline management structures, allowing most members of the revolutionary committees to go deep into the grassroots, eating, living, and working with the broad masses of workers, and timely solving problems in revolution and production, effectively promoting the development of revolution and production.

The revolutionary workers in coal mines across the country deeply understand that the quality of coal production is not only related to the development of the national economy and the people's livelihood but also related to the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They insist on putting politics in command, using Mao Zedong Thought to guide production, analyzing and solving production problems, and the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works has further developed. The widespread promotion of Mao Zedong Thought has further stimulated the enthusiasm of the miners for revolution and production. Fengfeng, Jingxing, Benxi, Zaozhuang, Fangzi, Yaojie, and other coal mines have, while over-fulfilling the state's coal production plan for the first half of the year, also completed the state's prescribed indicators for opening and tunneling ahead of schedule, creating favorable conditions for increasing coal production in the future.

### 全国煤矿抓革命促生产不断取得新胜利

    在毛主席林副主席两次接见全国煤炭职工代表的极大鼓舞下
    全国煤矿抓革命促生产不断取得新胜利
    各矿区在解放军帮助下，大多数单位实现了革命大联合和革命三结合。他们以阶级斗争为纲，狠抓革命大批判，结合清理阶级队伍；实行精兵简政，密切联系群众，有力地推动了生产的发展
    新华社十三日讯　在伟大领袖毛主席和他的亲密战友林彪副主席两次接见全国煤炭工业战线抓革命、促生产会议代表的鼓舞和推动下，各地煤矿出现了一派欣欣向荣的大好形势。广大革命职工怀着对毛主席无限热爱、无限忠诚的深厚无产阶级感情，进一步落实毛主席的一系列最新指示，狠抓革命，猛促生产，革命、生产不断取得新的成就。
    到目前为止，煤炭工业部直属的大型煤矿，绝大多数单位在毛泽东思想的原则基础上实现了革命的大联合，百分之七十以上的单位实现了革命三结合。在各级革命委员会的领导和人民解放军支左人员的帮助下，各矿区的革命大批判一浪高过一浪，各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班越办越好，广大革命职工活学活用毛主席著作的热情，从来没有象现在这样高涨。革命推动了生产。六月份全国大型煤矿的平均日产量，比五月份提高了百分之十以上，七月上旬又比六月份有所提高。特别是七月一日，毛主席第二次接见全国煤矿职工代表的第二天，广大革命职工为了庆祝党的生日，报答毛主席对矿工的关怀，许多煤矿都创造了一九六○年以来的生产最高纪录。这一天全国大型煤矿的原煤日产量，超过国家计划百分之二十以上。
    伟大领袖毛主席亲自主持制定的“十六条”指出：“无产阶级文化大革命是使我国社会生产力发展的一个强大的推动力。”各矿区出现的生气勃勃的新气象，首先就是深入开展革命大批判大抓阶级斗争的结果。开滦、大同煤矿职工，怀着对伟大领袖毛主席的无限热爱，走上大批判的战场，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫等党内一小撮最大的走资派。他们说：在万恶的旧社会，矿工不如牛马。是毛主席，共产党，把我们从水深火热中救了出来，当了国家的主人。中国赫鲁晓夫硬拉我们走回头路，要我们受二遍苦，这是痴心妄想，一千个办不到，一万个办不到。工人们在革命大批判中，痛斥党内最大的一小撮走资派及其在煤炭系统的代理人贩卖的“物质刺激”、“奖金挂帅”等修正主义黑货，并且结合批判，着手改革不合理的制度，革命和生产的积极性大大提高。六月份，这两个矿都提前超额完成了生产计划；进入七月以后，又连续创造了高产纪录。
    北京、枣庄、淮南、七台河、本溪、阜新、辽源、焦作、新汶、邯郸等煤矿，在深入开展革命大批判中，紧密结合清理阶级队伍。矿工们狠批中国赫鲁晓夫的“阶级斗争熄灭”论和叛徒哲学等反革命修正主义的谬论，深挖隐藏的叛徒、特务、死不悔改的走资派和其他反革命分子。由于大抓了阶级斗争，有力地提高了职工们的无产阶级觉悟和两条路线斗争的觉悟，生产也出现了新气象。
    《人民日报》、《红旗》杂志、《解放军报》“七一”社论发表以后，各地煤矿更是紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，把发扬党的紧密联系群众的优良传统，看成是建设革命委员会的根本途径。许多煤矿的革命委员会都采取了措施，精简了管理机构，让大部分革命委员会成员深入基层，和广大职工同吃同住同劳动，及时解决革命和生产中的问题，有效地促进了革命和生产的发展。
    各地煤矿的革命职工深深懂得，煤炭生产的好坏，不仅关系到国民经济的发展和人民生活，而且关系到夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。他们坚持政治挂帅，用毛泽东思想去统帅生产，分析和解决生产中的问题，活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动有了进一步发展。毛泽东思想的大普及，进一步激发了矿工们的革命和生产的积极性。峰峰、井陉、本溪、枣庄、坊子、窑街等煤矿，在超额完成上半年原煤生产计划的同时，开拓和掘进也都提前超额完成了国家规定的指标，为今后增产煤炭创造了有利条件。
