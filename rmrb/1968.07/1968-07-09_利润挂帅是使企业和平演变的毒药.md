Title: Profit as the Guiding Principle is a Poison for the Peaceful Evolution of Enterprises

Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "Politics is the commander, the soul. 'Political work is the lifeline of all economic work.' 'As long as our ideological work and political work are slightly relaxed, economic work and technical work will definitely go astray.' In the 'Anshan Constitution' personally formulated by Chairman Mao, it is clearly stipulated that political leadership is one of the basic principles for running socialist industrial enterprises. This points out the way for building socialist industrial enterprises.

The Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in the industrial and transportation systems are particularly afraid of political leadership, afraid that the working class armed with Mao Zedong Thought will shatter their dream of restoring capitalism. They picked up the "profit as the guiding principle" from the capitalist and revisionist garbage heap to oppose political leadership. What is "profit as the guiding principle"? The Chinese Khrushchev said it most clearly: "Factories making money is legitimate, what's the point of running a factory if it doesn't make money? 'A factory must make money, if it doesn't make money, it should close down and stop paying wages.' The Chinese Khrushchev and his ilk can't go three sentences without mentioning 'money.' Money, money, money. Enterprises need to make money, if they don't make money, they should 'close down,' 'stop paying wages.' They use the 'profit principle' as the driving force for enterprise production, attempting to lead socialist enterprises down the path of capitalist liberalization.

To make money, in some enterprises where a small handful of capitalist-roaders and remnants of the Kuomintang reactionaries have seized leadership, and in some enterprises deeply poisoned by the revisionist line of the Chinese Khrushchev, there will be phenomena of disregarding our country's socialist planned economy to engage in production outside the state plan; there will be phenomena of disregarding quality, falsifying, passing off inferior goods as superior, and passing off shoddy goods as good; there will be phenomena of ruthlessly damaging cooperation between sister factories and between regions; there will be phenomena of lowering input prices and raising output prices to profit from the difference.

The Chinese Khrushchev and his ilk vigorously promote "profit as the guiding principle" with the purpose of attempting to change the color of our country's enterprises, making them formally socialist but actually capitalist enterprises. However, the broad masses of the working class in our country are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, infinitely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. They resolutely stand up to resist and oppose a small handful of capitalist-roaders and remnants of the Kuomintang reactionaries, forcing them in some enterprises to not have their way. The working class in our country remembers Chairman Mao's teachings that politics is the commander, the soul, and fights against the revisionist line of the Chinese Khrushchev, firmly walking the correct path of running socialist enterprises as indicated by Chairman Mao. Thus, it is ensured that Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line always occupies the dominant position in our country's enterprises, ensuring that our country's enterprises advance along the socialist path.

We insist on political leadership and oppose profit as the guiding principle, which does not mean that socialist enterprises do not need to accumulate funds. Our country is conducting large-scale socialist construction, and it is not possible to accumulate funds. However, we accumulate funds not by taking the capitalist road, not by adopting the capitalist management method of seeking profit at all costs, but only by following Chairman Mao's teachings and implementing the policy of "increasing production and saving," "building the country through thrift." Chairman Mao teaches us: "Any socialist economic undertaking must pay attention to making the most of manpower and equipment, improving labor organization, improving management, and increasing labor productivity, saving all possible manpower and material resources, conducting labor competitions and economic accounting, thereby gradually reducing costs, increasing personal income, and increasing accumulation." The path indicated by Chairman Mao is the only correct path for socialist enterprises to accumulate funds.

Is it political leadership or profit as the guiding principle? This is an important aspect of the struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie for the enterprise's position, a fundamental difference between Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and the counter-revolutionary revisionist line. We proletarian revolutionaries must use Mao Zedong Thought as the guiding principle, emphasize proletarian politics, thoroughly criticize and expose the fallacies of the profit as the guiding principle advocated by the Chinese Khrushchev, eradicate all revisionist and capitalist poisons, and ensure that the proletarian iron mountain will never change color.

    利润挂帅是使企业和平演变的毒药
    红工
    伟大的领袖毛主席教导我们说：政治是统帅，是灵魂。“政治工作是一切经济工作的生命线。”“只要我们的思想工作和政治工作稍为一放松，经济工作和技术工作就一定会走到邪路上去。”在毛主席亲自制定的“鞍钢宪法”中，又明确地把政治挂帅规定为办好社会主义工业企业的基本原则之一。这就为建设社会主义工业企业指明了道路。
    中国赫鲁晓夫及其在工业交通系统的代理人，特别害怕政治挂帅，害怕我们工人阶级用毛泽东思想武装起来，打破他们复辟资本主义的黄粱美梦。他们就从资本主义、修正主义的垃圾堆里拣来了“利润挂帅”这一破烂货，来对抗政治挂帅。什么叫“利润挂帅”？中国赫鲁晓夫说得最清楚不过了：“工厂赚钱这是正当的，不赚钱开工厂干什么？”“一个工厂一定要赚钱，不赚钱就应关门，停发工资。”中国赫鲁晓夫之流三句话离不开一个“钱”字。钱，钱，钱，企业要赚钱，不赚钱就“关门”，“停发工资”。他们把“利润原则”作为推动企业生产的动力，妄图把社会主义企业引向资本主义自由化的邪路。
      为了赚钱，在某些被一小撮走资派和国民党反动派的残渣余孽篡夺了领导权的企业里，在一些受中国赫鲁晓夫的修正主义路线毒害比较深的企业里，就会发生不顾我国社会主义计划经济，去搞国家计划以外的生产的现象；就会发生不顾质量，弄虚作假，以次顶好，以劣充优的现象；就会发生不惜破坏兄弟厂之间、地区之间的协作关系的现象；就会发生压低进厂价格，提高出厂售价，从中渔利的现象。
    中国赫鲁晓夫之流大肆推行“利润挂帅”，其目的就是妄图使我国企业改变颜色，成为形式上是社会主义、实际上是资本主义的企业。但是，我国广大工人阶级无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于毛泽东思想，无限忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，坚决起来抵制和反对一小撮走资派和国民党反动派的残渣余孽，迫使他们在某些企业里，不能为所欲为。我国工人阶级牢记毛主席关于政治是统帅，是灵魂的教导，同中国赫鲁晓夫的修正主义路线作斗争，坚定地走毛主席指引的办社会主义企业的正确道路，从而，保证毛主席的无产阶级革命路线在我国企业中始终占居统治地位，保证我国企业沿着社会主义道路前进。
    我们坚持政治挂帅，反对利润挂帅，并不是说社会主义企业就不要积累资金了。我国进行大规模的社会主义建设，不积累资金是不行的。但是，我们积累资金不能走资本主义道路，不能采取唯利是图的资本主义经营方式，而只能遵循毛主席的教导，实行“增产节约”、“勤俭建国”的方针。毛主席教导我们：“任何社会主义的经济事业，必须注意尽可能充分地利用人力和设备，尽可能改善劳动组织、改善经营管理和提高劳动生产率，节约一切可能节约的人力和物力，实行劳动竞赛和经济核算，借以逐年降低成本，增加个人收入和增加积累。”毛主席所指引的路，才是社会主义企业积累资金的唯一正确的道路。
    是政治挂帅，还是利润挂帅？这是无产阶级和资产阶级争夺企业阵地的重要方面，是毛主席的无产阶级革命路线和反革命修正主义路线的一个根本区别。我们无产阶级革命派，一定要用毛泽东思想挂帅，突出无产阶级政治，彻底批倒、批臭中国赫鲁晓夫鼓吹的利润挂帅的谬论，铲除一切修正主义、资本主义的毒菌，保证无产阶级的铁打江山永不变色。
